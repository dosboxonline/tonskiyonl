WEBVTT

02:10.126 --> 02:12.164
(Driver) Are you Japanese?

02:13.792 --> 02:17.574
Want me to introduce you
to some good-looking babes?

02:21.041 --> 02:23.744
Asshole doesn't even speak English.

03:07.246 --> 03:10.363
(Bellboy) Is, er …
Is this all right, sir?

03:18.578 --> 03:20.653
Thank you, sir.

03:29.745 --> 03:31.783
(Whistles)

03:37.868 --> 03:39.906
(Silent)

04:03.657 --> 04:05.317
Are you going out, sir?

04:06.991 --> 04:10.772
Oh, please don't bother, sir.
You already gave me a tip.

04:27.823 --> 04:31.603
(Bellboy) Please take
the gentleman to this address.

04:31.697 --> 04:32.775
(Driver) Got it.

04:49.863 --> 04:53.607
He worked here a while ago,
but he got into some trouble,

04:53.695 --> 04:55.734
so I fired him.

04:59.376 --> 05:01.085
He says he quit.

05:07.293 --> 05:08.585
Excuse me!

05:10.168 --> 05:12.710
Yamamoto lives near here.

05:12.876 --> 05:15.876
Go 3 Blocks that way,
and then turn left.

05:16.043 --> 05:17.835
He lives above the Trade Building.

05:18.626 --> 05:22.085
He's into some bad business
with some black guys.

05:22.251 --> 05:25.168
Better be careful.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.855
(Breaking glass)

06:19.938 --> 06:23.470
Damn! Where the fuck
are your eyes, motherfucker?

06:23.563 --> 06:27.307
Huh? What you gonna do
about my wine, motherfucker?

06:27.394 --> 06:31.010
Ain't some old cheap-ass wine.
Gonna cost you $200!

06:31.144 --> 06:35.009
Huh, yeah … huh? Huh?

06:37.811 --> 06:39.009
Shit!

06:40.269 --> 06:42.676
(Groans)

07:41.335 --> 07:42.501
Hey!

07:46.460 --> 07:47.626
Hey!

07:57.846 --> 08:00.381
(Phone)

08:06.126 --> 08:08.501
Hello. Good Day, Sir!

08:10.293 --> 08:13.126
The Big Boss wants to go out?

08:14.710 --> 08:16.418
Yes.
Please wait a moment.

08:18.918 --> 08:21.668
Hey, move your short legs!

08:28.001 --> 08:29.376
Excuse me.

08:39.001 --> 08:41.710
We're in the middle of a war now!

08:47.001 --> 08:48.210
Got it!

09:19.043 --> 09:20.460
Hey, go upstairs!

09:20.668 --> 09:22.335
Yes, Sir!

09:23.876 --> 09:26.126
Keep it open, asshole!

09:33.046 --> 09:34.788
Tobacco.

09:35.418 --> 09:36.668
Get out!

09:42.043 --> 09:43.376
Please.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.251
Any new girls?

09:57.293 --> 10:00.043
The same old faces.

10:00.501 --> 10:01.751
A pack of cigarettes.

10:05.418 --> 10:06.960
What about her?

10:07.293 --> 10:10.001
Come on.
She's Mr. Yoshida's girl.

10:10.501 --> 10:14.085
Right.
I haven't seen him for some time.

10:23.126 --> 10:24.751
What about him?

10:25.460 --> 10:28.335
Oh, Jun.

10:28.501 --> 10:30.543
He was introduced by a liquor vendor.
Shall I …?

10:30.710 --> 10:32.293
No, no.

10:40.418 --> 10:43.293
It's great to get out of the house.

10:43.460 --> 10:46.460
Lots of great women here!

10:48.835 --> 10:51.960
No fun at home staring at the old bag.

10:52.543 --> 10:54.168
Come on, drink up!

11:49.293 --> 11:51.376
Take the boss home!

11:53.210 --> 11:56.335
Big Boss, please.
- What? We're leaving already?

11:57.001 --> 11:59.251
Let him pass.
- Spoil sports!

12:18.293 --> 12:19.710
Too weak, Sir?

12:19.876 --> 12:21.168
Too strong!

12:28.001 --> 12:29.001
Brother,

12:30.710 --> 12:33.793
shouldn't we call
a truce with the enemy?

12:35.918 --> 12:38.376
You're getting soft.

12:38.543 --> 12:42.210
Can't be so headstrong,
We're not young anymore.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.960
Cops are already here.

13:00.668 --> 13:02.960
Dump it somewhere.

13:07.418 --> 13:09.293
Hope the boss went home.

13:09.793 --> 13:11.668
And not to his mistress's.

14:01.585 --> 14:03.501
Why the fuck are you here?

14:23.126 --> 14:25.085
That's how it is,

14:25.251 --> 14:28.001
so might as well come to an agreement.

14:29.376 --> 14:32.251
We don't want it to get out of hand.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.293
Better to disband the family.

14:42.376 --> 14:45.626
Hisamatsu says he'll look after you.

14:49.460 --> 14:52.126
Goddammit. This is a wake?

14:54.668 --> 14:56.876
Shit happens.

14:59.001 --> 15:00.710
"Shit happens"?

15:01.626 --> 15:03.293
What's with this tie?

15:03.460 --> 15:06.543
Back off, punk!

15:16.626 --> 15:18.501
"I have a wife with children

15:19.418 --> 15:21.543
and my men."

15:22.751 --> 15:24.585
"I cut off my finger.

15:25.418 --> 15:28.418
So let me join the family
that killed our Boss."

15:29.001 --> 15:30.418
"Please, Brother?"

15:31.543 --> 15:34.293
Don't brother me!
I don't want this!

15:38.918 --> 15:42.043
I should kill you, you traitor!

15:43.001 --> 15:45.126
You call yourself a yakuza?

15:47.085 --> 15:48.960
He's doing it for us.

15:49.126 --> 15:52.251
Please kill me instead.

15:52.501 --> 15:54.335
Please forgive us! Please!

15:54.501 --> 15:56.585
You stay out of this!

16:00.918 --> 16:02.710
Sorry, brother.

16:03.251 --> 16:05.501
Never mind.
I'll talk to Aniki for you.

16:07.626 --> 16:08.710
Well, see you.

16:09.251 --> 16:12.585
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

16:24.793 --> 16:26.960
You're out of line.

17:51.585 --> 17:54.335
I declare this to Mr. Harada
and the 10 men

17:54.501 --> 17:57.585
who will become dependents.

17:58.543 --> 18:02.084
As you drink the sacred sake
before you,

18:02.085 --> 18:07.835
you will become members
of the Hisamatsu Family.

18:08.835 --> 18:12.501
As you may already realize

18:13.001 --> 18:16.335
in the strict world of the yakuza

18:17.460 --> 18:21.626
even if your boss tells you,
white is black

18:21.793 --> 18:26.126
you must put aside all reservations
and agree to his view.

18:28.126 --> 18:29.585
Damn Hisamatsu!

18:29.751 --> 18:31.835
Why is he taking that bastard in?

18:33.835 --> 18:36.543
I think the police pressured him.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.710
There was no alternative.

18:39.835 --> 18:43.668
This way,
our enemy is finished.

19:08.335 --> 19:09.960
Aniki doesn't fit in.

19:10.126 --> 19:13.543
It's like he's not needed.
Cause he's an outsider.

19:15.335 --> 19:18.084
After all, you were enemies.

19:18.085 --> 19:19.751
It can't be helped.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.751
I've been told to kill you.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.585
You're a pain in their ass

19:32.335 --> 19:34.210
and they don't trust me.

19:40.751 --> 19:42.418
Then, kill me.

19:43.126 --> 19:44.168
Come on!

19:45.418 --> 19:46.960
We're sworn brothers.

19:51.751 --> 19:53.668
Could you leave the country?

19:54.835 --> 19:56.418
I'll take care of everything.

19:57.543 --> 19:59.710
I could go to America.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.001
My kid brother's there.

20:03.251 --> 20:05.126
Impossible for a yakuza?

20:05.918 --> 20:08.626
Brother, would you really go?

20:09.501 --> 20:12.418
The Chinese guys
can make up a passport.

20:13.001 --> 20:15.751
I'll get you some money, too.
Please.

20:17.168 --> 20:18.418
I owe you one.

20:45.460 --> 20:48.543
Hey, I'm supposed to die.

20:55.876 --> 20:57.418
Who is he?

20:58.210 --> 21:00.001
A bum named Sakamoto.

21:00.168 --> 21:01.793
Let's see his face!

21:04.793 --> 21:07.043
Doesn't look anything like him.

21:08.168 --> 21:10.043
Hey, put these clothes to him!

21:12.835 --> 21:15.251
Destroy his face and hands.
Burn his back.

21:15.418 --> 21:17.960
And plant the driver's license on him.

21:20.876 --> 21:23.085
Give me booze. Booze.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.835
What a dirty bag!

21:45.251 --> 21:48.168
We were too busy
getting the money

21:48.335 --> 21:50.543
to get a better bag.

21:56.751 --> 21:58.793
So, my name's Sakamoto.

21:59.001 --> 22:03.626
When you sign your name,
please use these characters.

22:03.793 --> 22:06.126
The PIN numbers are there.

22:08.626 --> 22:10.335
What's this 1-1-2-3?

22:10.793 --> 22:12.376
Big Brother Harada's birthday.

22:12.543 --> 22:15.043
Says he wants you to remember him.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.876
That idiot!

22:30.269 --> 22:32.011
Hey, who the hell are you?

22:37.210 --> 22:38.460
Aniki!

22:49.835 --> 22:50.793
Aniki?

22:52.543 --> 22:55.043
My friends,
Jay and Mo.

22:55.725 --> 22:57.267
This is my big brother.

22:57.350 --> 22:59.223
- Hey, whassup?
- Whassup?

22:59.308 --> 23:03.005
(Brother) Where's Denny?
How come he's not here yet?

23:03.099 --> 23:05.634
(Jay) Must be gambling again.

23:05.723 --> 23:08.334
(Brother) Let's go
without him, then.

23:08.335 --> 23:12.168
We've got something to do.
Stay here.

23:12.335 --> 23:14.001
We'll get something to eat later.

23:15.348 --> 23:18.596
(Mo) Check it.
(Brother) OK, let's go.

23:52.553 --> 23:54.960
You doing all right?

23:55.053 --> 23:57.092
(Indistinct chatter)

24:04.843 --> 24:07.546
That's how I have
to hit 'em sometimes.

24:07.635 --> 24:09.792
I can feel 'em!

24:09.885 --> 24:12.256
One, two, three, four, let's go!

24:16.176 --> 24:19.211
(Jay) 'You're brothers,
but you don't look alike.'

24:19.301 --> 24:24.042
Yeah. We are half-brothers.
I don't know the details.

24:24.134 --> 24:26.670
We were all abandoned.

24:26.759 --> 24:28.749
Isn't that right, my brother?

24:30.085 --> 24:31.501
We were orphans, huh?

24:35.008 --> 24:38.291
We were all put in, er,
some funny institution.

24:38.383 --> 24:41.499
My brother paid for me
to come here and study.

24:41.590 --> 24:43.546
And you end up pushing drugs.

24:43.632 --> 24:46.251
Don't say that
in front of my brother.

24:46.340 --> 24:49.374
But he doesn't
understand English anyway.

24:55.507 --> 24:57.663
Is there anything you need, sir?

24:57.756 --> 25:01.003
Do you have water?
I'll get you some right away.

25:01.088 --> 25:04.371
And what time will you be
leaving tomorrow, sir?

25:23.170 --> 25:25.659
Damn! No tip this time!

25:36.793 --> 25:40.668
Aniki, you shouldn't tip
the hotel maid $100!

25:43.210 --> 25:45.830
He gave the maid 100 bucks
to make his bed.

25:45.918 --> 25:47.707
He must be really loaded.

25:47.791 --> 25:52.325
Then the maid left him
$95 change and this note saying,

25:52.410 --> 25:57.062
"You shouldn't spend money
like this. $5 is enough."

25:58.277 --> 26:00.266
If it were me, I'd have kept it.

26:00.358 --> 26:01.980
(Mo) Hell, yeah!

26:08.723 --> 26:11.090
Hey, Denny. What happened?

26:11.178 --> 26:12.883
(Sighs and groans)

26:14.257 --> 26:16.744
Some joker cut me up yesterday, man.

26:16.838 --> 26:19.786
- Who?
- Fuck if I know.

26:19.875 --> 26:22.408
Chink. Some Jap motherfucker, man.

26:22.496 --> 26:25.610
Must've been trying to gank
another tourist.

26:25.701 --> 26:27.276
You don't give up, do you?

26:27.365 --> 26:31.484
Denny, this is my big brother.
He's here from Japan.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.922
Your brother didn't run into me
yesterday, did he?

26:43.012 --> 26:45.961
He's not the one
who fucked my eye up, is he?

26:46.050 --> 26:47.672
What?

26:47.793 --> 26:50.501
Aniki, didn't meet him yesterday,
right?

26:53.001 --> 26:55.460
Didn't cut his eye, right?

26:55.870 --> 26:58.238
All Japanese look the same to you.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.693
You can't tell one from the other.

27:03.236 --> 27:06.681
- Maybe so.
- Well, shall we go?

27:06.774 --> 27:10.810
Yo. Y'all gotta roll without me, man.
This shit is hurting.

27:10.894 --> 27:13.675
Then you can hang out
with my brother.

27:13.765 --> 27:15.800
But he doesn't speak English.

27:15.887 --> 27:18.751
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with him?

27:18.841 --> 27:20.960
Drink beer and kill time.

27:21.046 --> 27:23.082
OK, Aniki.

27:23.168 --> 27:26.081
How much beer
are we supposed to drink?

27:34.946 --> 27:36.982
(Silent)

28:14.354 --> 28:16.425
Let's play.

28:25.214 --> 28:27.418
(Traffic, sirens in distance)

28:35.910 --> 28:38.029
(Denny) 'All right, check it out.'

28:38.115 --> 28:41.394
I'm betting you
six to one odds, all right?

28:41.486 --> 28:44.267
So if I win,
that's six times, all right?

28:44.357 --> 28:47.801
If I bet $10 I get 60 back, OK?

28:47.894 --> 28:49.930
Roll the dice.

28:51.098 --> 28:54.176
Um, ah, let me think … three.

28:54.261 --> 28:57.706
Three. It's gonna be a three.
I know it in my heart.

29:02.584 --> 29:06.325
- Six.
- Oh, you betting, too?

29:06.412 --> 29:09.740
All right. Well, if you win
you get $60, you know?

29:09.825 --> 29:11.861
Let's see who's gonna …

29:11.947 --> 29:14.646
(Chuckling) Ain't that a bitch?

29:14.735 --> 29:17.351
All right,
let's do it one more time.

29:17.440 --> 29:21.477
This time I got two and four
at three to one odds, all right?

29:21.559 --> 29:24.755
So if I get one of them,
that's three times, OK?

29:24.847 --> 29:28.043
All right?
Let's see what you got now, player.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.544
Come on. Come on.

29:32.713 --> 29:34.701
What? What?

29:36.499 --> 29:38.039
Six.

29:38.122 --> 29:42.158
No, no! Ain't nobody
gonna get six twice in a row!

29:42.241 --> 29:45.153
You crazy, man, or what?
Well, what is it?

29:47.693 --> 29:50.014
Ain't that a …

29:50.106 --> 29:52.723
Something wrong
with these dice, man!

29:52.812 --> 29:55.890
You're cheating.
Something. God damn!

29:57.681 --> 29:59.716
$20, man …

30:07.876 --> 30:09.667
Hey, where you going, man?

30:09.751 --> 30:11.828
Ah, ta-ba-ko.

30:11.920 --> 30:16.165
Ta … ta-ba-ko. What?

30:16.255 --> 30:17.881
Cigarette.

30:17.965 --> 30:23.420
Oh, tobacco! There's a store
right out there. Check it out.

30:23.510 --> 30:24.839
(Door closes)

30:24.928 --> 30:27.633
Cheatin'-ass mother …

30:27.721 --> 30:30.213
What the hell?

30:30.307 --> 30:34.138
Oh, now, ain't this a bitch?
Oh, yeah.

30:34.225 --> 30:37.226
A fucking hole in the cup?

30:37.311 --> 30:39.184
Son of a bitch!

30:41.063 --> 30:42.890
A hole in the cup!

30:42.980 --> 30:45.816
It's the oldest trick
in the book, man!

30:50.152 --> 30:52.477
I can't believe this shit.

30:56.948 --> 30:59.984
Hand over the money
for the last batch.

31:00.075 --> 31:01.902
All right.

31:13.249 --> 31:14.709
What the fuck is this?

31:14.792 --> 31:18.457
- Fifteen hundred, right?
- No, three Gs.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.003
Hey, that's too much.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.830
That's the price.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.714
We can't make money, then.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.632
Take it or leave it.
I didn't make you sell drugs.

31:26.716 --> 31:30.085
- What are we supposed to do?
- Shut the fuck up!

32:16.205 --> 32:19.206
All right, you cheating son
of a bitch, where's my money?

32:25.585 --> 32:27.251
I'm leaving.

32:28.001 --> 32:31.251
Don't go, Aniki!
His thugs will get you.

32:33.001 --> 32:35.126
Got any guns?

32:35.293 --> 32:38.001
Some old ones.
- Bring them!

32:56.855 --> 33:00.852
Mo, get my brother
back to the hotel … please.

33:00.940 --> 33:02.980
- All right.
- Be careful!

33:12.823 --> 33:14.615
What the fuck is going on?

33:14.699 --> 33:17.273
Ken's brother
beat the shit out of Victor.

33:17.368 --> 33:20.570
(Laughing) That's tight!

33:23.247 --> 33:26.865
Are you the Jap
that beat up the boss, hmm?

33:26.957 --> 33:29.032
Come with us. Come on.

33:29.124 --> 33:30.583
(Mo) Yo, hold up, man.

33:30.667 --> 33:33.537
You don't follow him.
We'll kill you.

33:38.423 --> 33:40.748
Hold up. Then why'd he hit Ken?

34:00.644 --> 34:01.843
(Falls on horn)

34:05.439 --> 34:07.396
(Horn continues)

34:11.234 --> 34:13.274
(Horn stops)

34:15.696 --> 34:17.735
(Car door opening)

34:26.077 --> 34:27.536
(Quiet samba music)

34:59.472 --> 35:02.010
What the fuck do you want,
cabrón, huh?

35:21.043 --> 35:23.793
I want them shot!
I'm fucking pissed!

35:21.237 --> 35:23.193
(Speaks Japanese)

35:23.278 --> 35:26.777
If you kill him in one shot,
he'll give you 10 bucks.

35:40.251 --> 35:41.751
What'll we do?

35:41.918 --> 35:43.793
Take their turf.

35:44.001 --> 35:47.001
We'll have trouble with the Mexicans.

35:47.168 --> 35:48.751
Then, it's war!

35:50.671 --> 35:54.584
My brother says we are
going to war with the cholos.

36:06.210 --> 36:09.210
Aniki,
do we have to stay in here forever?

36:09.710 --> 36:13.210
No choice.
We go out, we're dead!

36:16.543 --> 36:18.168
Hitmen may be here already.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.475
(Knock at door)

36:42.043 --> 36:43.376
Aniki?

36:44.043 --> 36:45.168
Kato?

36:46.668 --> 36:48.251
What's going on?

36:48.418 --> 36:50.418
I'm at war in America, too.

37:01.506 --> 37:04.839
(Jay) What exactly
did he do in Japan?

37:04.925 --> 37:07.002
(Ken) He was a gangster.

37:08.135 --> 37:10.425
(Mo) Who's the other guy?

37:10.512 --> 37:12.588
(Ken) His lieutenant.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.720
(Conversation inaudible)

38:29.126 --> 38:30.085
Aniki!

38:31.085 --> 38:33.043
They contacted us.

38:33.210 --> 38:35.960
What did they say?
- Want to meet tomorrow.

38:36.335 --> 38:37.460
Where?

38:37.626 --> 38:40.460
At the Sunset Square Hotel at 10:00.

39:00.293 --> 39:01.793
Hide them.

39:02.001 --> 39:03.168
All right.

39:05.668 --> 39:07.960
I'll check the conference room.

39:08.335 --> 39:10.374
Where we gonna hide these?

39:11.877 --> 39:14.201
Take 'em out of the bag.

39:21.129 --> 39:23.167
- Will it fit?
- Yeah.

39:26.213 --> 39:28.370
Wait a minute.

39:38.883 --> 39:40.920
OK.

40:17.055 --> 40:20.008
So do you think you'd
get away with what you did?

40:20.085 --> 40:23.210
They're asking,
if we think we can get away with it.

40:24.043 --> 40:25.751
So. Want a war?

40:27.058 --> 40:29.678
What are you gonna do?
Go to war with us?

40:29.767 --> 40:31.226
We'd wipe you out!

40:32.335 --> 40:34.251
They say they'll kill us.

40:34.418 --> 40:36.085
Tell them: try it.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.177
Bring it on. Come on!

40:38.268 --> 40:39.726
(Laughs)

40:39.809 --> 40:42.264
Just relax. We're kidding.

40:42.352 --> 40:45.802
Let's discuss this
like gentlemen, yeah?

40:45.895 --> 40:48.384
We'll give you the territory.

40:48.478 --> 40:50.850
We didn't like those guys anyway.

40:50.937 --> 40:55.929
From now on, you're gonna be
in charge, just as it always was.

40:56.022 --> 40:59.140
You don't have any
objection to that, right?

41:00.001 --> 41:03.376
They say they'll give us the turf.
- Say: we accept.

41:04.482 --> 41:06.520
OK, we accept.

41:06.835 --> 41:08.418
Okay, go!

41:19.234 --> 41:21.191
(Door closes)

41:23.568 --> 41:26.853
You told them you'd let them
have the territory.

41:26.944 --> 41:29.517
Why do that for these fucking Japs?

41:29.612 --> 41:32.232
Why not?

41:32.320 --> 41:35.438
We're gonna massacre 'em
all later anyway.

42:14.293 --> 42:17.418
It was occupied.
Couldn't get them.

42:18.293 --> 42:20.251
What're we going to do?

42:20.710 --> 42:22.710
Feel under the table.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.710
Good to have insurance.

43:10.793 --> 43:13.710
I understand fucking Jap,
asshole!

43:59.097 --> 44:01.469
Where did Aniki say we were going?

44:01.557 --> 44:03.762
He said he's meeting some woman.

44:05.085 --> 44:06.710
A date?

44:09.918 --> 44:12.043
He's interested in women now?

44:38.605 --> 44:40.478
I'm sorry I'm late.

44:40.564 --> 44:43.517
Hi, guys. I'm Marina.
Nice to meet you.

44:45.710 --> 44:48.585
Can't make out
if she's pretty or ugly

44:48.751 --> 44:50.626
but she's sure got class.

44:50.793 --> 44:52.251
What the fuck?

44:52.751 --> 44:55.793
Just joking. She's beautiful.

44:56.650 --> 44:58.689
He's just joking.

45:00.918 --> 45:02.501
Thank you!

45:14.571 --> 45:16.811
(Ken) 'Hey, where's Denny?'

45:16.904 --> 45:20.105
(Mo) 'It's his mom's birthday,
he's at home.'

45:20.197 --> 45:22.900
(Ken) 'Doesn't his mom
work any more?'

45:22.988 --> 45:26.024
(Jay) 'She don't need
to be a maid any more.'

45:26.114 --> 45:27.822
(Ken) 'Right, right.'

45:27.906 --> 45:29.945
(Chatter)

45:38.116 --> 45:42.029
- Hey. Thanks for coming by.
- No problem, man. Free food!

45:43.868 --> 45:45.907
Hey, Ma, these are my friends.

45:47.827 --> 45:50.493
- Hello.
- Happy birthday, Mrs Turner.

45:50.577 --> 45:52.652
This is for you, from my brother.

45:52.743 --> 45:55.411
Oh, from your brother? Thank you.

45:57.579 --> 46:01.325
Ah, he's not my brother.
He's not here.

46:01.412 --> 46:03.784
Oh, OK, all right.

46:03.871 --> 46:07.453
Listen, would you guys help
yourself to cake, please?

46:07.539 --> 46:08.737
OK.

46:08.831 --> 46:11.368
Go on. There's a lot
for everybody. Go on.

46:12.915 --> 46:16.863
(Giggling) Oh, look at this!
This couldn't fit me.

46:16.958 --> 46:18.451
- For Latifah.
- Is it?

46:18.541 --> 46:20.414
- Come on. Come here.
- For me?

46:20.499 --> 46:22.870
Yes. Oh, Latifah.
Oh, my goodness.

46:22.958 --> 46:24.749
You know how to put this on?

46:27.875 --> 46:30.662
That … That …

46:30.751 --> 46:35.288
That bitch took Aniki, took Aniki.

46:37.788 --> 46:41.069
Oh, this is nice.
I know when I'm gonna use this!

46:41.161 --> 46:44.028
Your friends
have such wonderful taste!

46:44.117 --> 46:48.985
There. Let's try this one.
Oh, boy.

46:51.403 --> 46:54.566
OK, OK, how do we get this off?
Ah, here we go.

46:57.316 --> 47:00.183
Ah, this is interesting.
What's in this?

47:07.726 --> 47:09.763
(Woman) Put 'em on!

47:09.849 --> 47:14.137
They know what to get you, don't
they? Don't they? Look at that.

47:14.221 --> 47:15.927
Oh, man.

47:16.011 --> 47:18.464
Now, don't try to be too cool.

47:56.543 --> 47:59.960
Higashiyama, pass the ball
to me! To me!

48:01.501 --> 48:05.001
It's my ball.
Isn't it my ball!

48:05.168 --> 48:07.293
Don't you know the rules?

48:11.251 --> 48:14.043
That's it. Higashiyama.
Over there. Pass it to me.

48:14.585 --> 48:19.751
That's why the Americans beat you!
All right. Over there.

48:21.001 --> 48:23.626
Hey, Minamino, over here!

48:23.793 --> 48:26.668
I'm open.
See?!

48:26.835 --> 48:30.543
Pass it.
What's the matter with you?

48:32.335 --> 48:36.085
Hey, Moose! Moose!

48:39.501 --> 48:41.335
Hey, Higashiyama, come here!

48:41.585 --> 48:44.210
You're out.
Because you won't pass.

48:44.376 --> 48:46.960
All right, Moose.
You're the helper.

48:50.501 --> 48:53.043
I'm telling you
to pass to me!

48:56.126 --> 48:57.835
All right, Moose …!
Pass to me.

49:00.293 --> 49:02.335
Come on, to me …

49:05.251 --> 49:07.793
I told you to pass
you bastard!

49:08.001 --> 49:09.293
Ouch!

49:44.043 --> 49:47.376
Why do you like this place?

49:48.293 --> 49:50.418
I lived in this kind of place.

49:51.835 --> 49:54.960
Must have been poor.
- Shut up!

50:19.376 --> 50:20.668
Let's go.

50:37.288 --> 50:38.864
Uh-huh.

50:38.953 --> 50:40.825
Come on, relax.

50:43.575 --> 50:46.407
- Ooh.
- Hey, Jay.

50:46.490 --> 50:49.155
I'm Michael Jordan.

50:49.238 --> 50:51.276
- What?
- I'm Michael Jordan.

50:51.362 --> 50:53.932
No, you're more like Michael Gordon.

50:54.027 --> 50:56.940
Not Michael Jordan,
don't get it twisted.

50:57.025 --> 51:00.354
- Michael Gordon, that's you.
- I'm Michael Jordan.

51:00.439 --> 51:03.306
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

51:03.396 --> 51:06.925
Y'all got Michael Jordan?
Not our Michael Jordan.

51:07.018 --> 51:09.054
- I'm Michael Jordan.
- Oh, OK.

51:09.141 --> 51:13.180
- The same Michael Jordan.
- Not the bald-headed Mike.

51:15.303 --> 51:18.715
No, you're like
Shaquille O'Neal right there.

51:18.801 --> 51:20.377
That's who you're like.

51:21.966 --> 51:25.247
- Shaq, you're like Shaq.
- I'm Michael Jordan.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.409
Man. Man.

51:33.790 --> 51:35.828
Er … woman.

51:40.245 --> 51:41.654
Man.

51:48.530 --> 51:50.106
Man.

51:54.236 --> 51:55.728
Man.

51:58.733 --> 52:01.977
Man, even if
I raise my handicap to 20 …

52:02.062 --> 52:05.343
How much more could I win
in an hour? It's crazy.

52:08.725 --> 52:11.426
- Woman.
- Damn.

52:15.511 --> 52:17.549
Woman.

52:21.841 --> 52:23.878
Woman.

52:23.965 --> 52:25.790
(Chuckling)

52:27.129 --> 52:29.037
Woman.

52:32.166 --> 52:35.945
The same woman is going
back and forth down the street.

52:36.039 --> 52:38.242
What's going on?

53:05.893 --> 53:07.931
That's Aniki's woman.

53:16.054 --> 53:17.759
(Money counter whirrs)

53:24.631 --> 53:26.455
Ken, would you sign this?

53:26.546 --> 53:28.950
All right.

53:29.044 --> 53:31.827
- Sign, please.
- OK.

53:39.870 --> 53:42.358
You're spending too much.

53:46.074 --> 53:49.024
What are you doing?
Hurry up, do some work!

53:55.793 --> 53:57.043
Check-mate.

53:57.774 --> 54:00.724
That was my piece
until a little while ago.

54:00.813 --> 54:03.301
Well, once we take it, it's ours.

54:03.395 --> 54:06.392
Oh, I get it. Kinda like you.

54:11.918 --> 54:13.335
What's that?

54:14.168 --> 54:18.376
This guy isn't paying up
so I'll send this to his house.

54:18.543 --> 54:21.751
Show me!
- Then, he'll have to pay up.

54:25.546 --> 54:26.873
Hey, how's it going?

54:26.962 --> 54:29.450
That ho hasn't called yet, sir.

54:29.543 --> 54:32.745
- How many hos do you have?
- Five, sir.

54:32.837 --> 54:34.581
Business is slow, huh?

54:42.467 --> 54:44.508
Nice fucking shirt!

54:53.306 --> 54:56.841
Japs and niggers! Big fucking deal!

55:34.371 --> 55:36.696
Hey, wanna play some dice?

55:36.789 --> 55:39.244
- Hmm, OK.
- All right. No cheating.

55:39.331 --> 55:40.743
(Laughing) OK.

55:40.832 --> 55:44.118
All right, I'm gonna
call my mother real quick.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.959
(Helicopter overhead)

55:56.883 --> 56:00.049
Hey, what's up, Ma? Yeah, it's me.

56:00.134 --> 56:02.092
I'm gonna be late, all right?

56:02.178 --> 56:06.127
Got some things I gotta do.
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

56:19.437 --> 56:21.476
Aniki?

56:26.232 --> 56:28.770
(Man) Drop the gun or I'll kill him.

56:28.793 --> 56:31.585
Denny, shoot! Shoot!

56:31.819 --> 56:35.353
- (Man) Drop the gun!
- Put the fucking gun down!

56:35.446 --> 56:38.400
(Man) I'll kill him!
(Aniki) Shoot! Shoot!

56:38.489 --> 56:39.817
Put the gun down!

56:39.907 --> 56:42.030
(Man) Drop it!
(Aniki) Shoot!

56:49.161 --> 56:51.201
Oh, shit.

57:02.877 --> 57:04.917
Aniki!

57:27.557 --> 57:29.100
He needs rest.

57:29.183 --> 57:33.928
All right.
Sorry, doc. Hope this is OK.

57:34.019 --> 57:35.644
Thanks.

57:48.251 --> 57:50.585
What the fuck did you do?

58:02.659 --> 58:04.487
(Gunshots)

58:24.505 --> 58:26.544
Keep your eyes open.

58:30.550 --> 58:33.669
Don't you think it's time
for your brother to move?

58:33.760 --> 58:36.049
He likes it here.

59:01.043 --> 59:02.960
What about you?

59:05.085 --> 59:06.960
I'll go with you, Aniki.

01:00:10.771 --> 01:00:12.266
How is he?

01:00:12.355 --> 01:00:15.640
Much better.
He was fooling around with Denny.

01:00:19.901 --> 01:00:22.273
We caught the pusher who ran away.

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:26.210
They caught the runaway pusher.

01:00:26.376 --> 01:00:29.043
What shall we do with him?
- Have him cut off his finger!

01:00:30.074 --> 01:00:32.399
What are you doing? Stand up!

01:00:35.826 --> 01:00:40.119
Hey! Go to the sushi bar.
Get knife and cutting board.

01:00:41.996 --> 01:00:43.788
What are you guys gonna do?

01:00:43.872 --> 01:00:45.912
Cut his finger off.

01:00:45.998 --> 01:00:48.703
What happens if you
cut his finger off?

01:00:48.792 --> 01:00:52.741
Erm … he can't
swim straight any more.

01:00:59.798 --> 01:01:03.213
How's that?
You can't feel anything, can you?

01:01:03.299 --> 01:01:05.541
(Fast, nervous breathing)

01:01:05.633 --> 01:01:07.128
Do it.

01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:12.429
Do it.

01:01:13.597 --> 01:01:15.424
Do it!

01:01:16.835 --> 01:01:21.001
I'll show you how to do it.
Stick your finger out!

01:01:22.935 --> 01:01:25.722
Wait, wait!
I'll give it back, all right?

01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:28.683
Just stop the shit.
Don't cut my fucking …

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.232
(Screaming) Oh, God!

01:01:30.315 --> 01:01:33.267
Get off me!

01:01:33.358 --> 01:01:37.022
Oh, shit! You mother-FUCK!

01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:52.168
Who's the boss of Little Tokyo?

01:01:52.793 --> 01:01:55.626
We can expand
if he joins us.

01:02:00.288 --> 01:02:02.198
- Hey, Mo.
- Yeah?

01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:04.413
Who's the boss of Little Tokyo?

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.907
Some, ah, player named Shirase.

01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:09.372
- Shirase?
- Shirase.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:13.454
Should I tell Aniki
if we got together,

01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:18.001
like join up with them,
our family will be bigger?

01:02:18.085 --> 01:02:20.409
What do you think?

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:27.543
A guy named Shirase.
Let's talk to Aniki.

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:31.243
Joining forces with Shirase
is a bad idea.

01:02:31.335 --> 01:02:35.033
- Why?
- He's way too dangerous.

01:02:39.002 --> 01:02:41.040
So are we.

01:03:03.628 --> 01:03:07.575
Hey, Aniki, want me to
get you some cigarettes?

01:03:07.669 --> 01:03:09.378
No, thanks.

01:03:09.462 --> 01:03:13.836
- Why?
- My stomach … hurts.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.915
(Sighing) I'm sorry, man.

01:03:18.004 --> 01:03:20.209
Just joking. Joking.

01:03:22.962 --> 01:03:25.249
You're messing with me, man.

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:39.003
(Ken) You wait here.

01:03:51.335 --> 01:03:53.835
Don't give me that bullshit.

01:03:55.418 --> 01:03:57.585
Be sworn brothers with him?

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:03.001
Be Yamamoto's henchman?

01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:05.376
What the fuck!

01:04:07.335 --> 01:04:08.835
I've come this far

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.251
by myself.

01:04:14.001 --> 01:04:16.085
I haven't had any help from anyone.

01:04:17.751 --> 01:04:21.751
Why doesn't Yamamoto come himself

01:04:21.918 --> 01:04:24.168
instead of a punk like you?

01:04:24.585 --> 01:04:28.293
Who the fuck does he think he is?

01:04:29.501 --> 01:04:33.001
Aniki's not good at things like this.

01:04:33.626 --> 01:04:35.793
This? Fuck him.

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:40.620
Hey. These fucking guys
want me to be a henchman, you know?

01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:44.208
What should I tell them?

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.293
You won't reconsider?

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.835
No way!

01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:55.126
If we joined up,
we'd be better off and bigger!

01:04:55.293 --> 01:04:59.210
I can do that on my own.
Get out!

01:04:59.668 --> 01:05:04.543
You motherfucker.
We can crush you, anytime!

01:05:05.543 --> 01:05:07.335
Just try it!

01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:19.501
Didn't work out.
- Thought so.

01:05:19.668 --> 01:05:22.418
He's impossible.
- Let's go.

01:05:31.043 --> 01:05:32.668
Hey, we're going.

01:05:32.835 --> 01:05:34.376
I have something to do.

01:05:34.543 --> 01:05:36.376
Let's go.
- My appointment …

01:05:38.793 --> 01:05:40.043
What is it?

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:13.418
What do you want?

01:06:13.585 --> 01:06:15.626
About what we discussed …

01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:18.126
I said the answer is no.

01:06:18.293 --> 01:06:20.960
We really want you to join us.

01:06:21.918 --> 01:06:26.043
If you like, you can be
equal brothers with Yamamoto.

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:28.210
That's bullshit!

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:33.626
I'd stake my life for Aniki.

01:06:36.043 --> 01:06:38.126
What're you talking about, asshole?

01:06:38.293 --> 01:06:40.626
A line from a gangster movie.

01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:45.335
Oh yeah? Let's see if you mean it.

01:06:46.126 --> 01:06:47.876
Lend me your gun.

01:06:52.251 --> 01:06:54.960
Go ahead. Stake your life!

01:07:08.668 --> 01:07:11.043
I count on you, uncle!

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.007
Hey, stop!

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:02.876
I'm all yours, Aniki.

01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:33.761
(Tires screech)

01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:23.168
Kill them!

01:11:03.979 --> 01:11:06.101
The boss says we don't need you.

01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:10.683
What is this bullshit? You need me!

01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:14.304
You wanna fucking expand,
you need me. I'm the man!

01:11:14.397 --> 01:11:18.059
You know how many I killed?
I got a long list of bodies!

01:11:18.147 --> 01:11:21.727
Fucking Japs cross me,
you'll be on that long list …

01:11:21.813 --> 01:11:23.722
(Gunshot)

01:11:29.938 --> 01:11:32.973
You! Come upstairs.

01:11:50.148 --> 01:11:54.391
- You did it this time, boy.
- How's your friend feel?

01:11:57.607 --> 01:12:00.806
You want some, come and get some

01:12:02.439 --> 01:12:04.561
Where you from? (Laughing)

01:12:12.024 --> 01:12:14.015
Take care, now.

01:12:23.585 --> 01:12:27.251
Who are they?
- Crooked cops. They're on the take.

01:12:31.168 --> 01:12:32.668
Get out of here.

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:40.084
Shirase, aren't you overdoing it?

01:12:40.085 --> 01:12:43.585
For Brother Kato's sake,

01:12:43.751 --> 01:12:46.210
we have to make this family bigger.

01:12:46.376 --> 01:12:48.543
I'm going all the way.

01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:56.543
Don't smoke that in front of me!

01:12:59.043 --> 01:13:00.335
Sorry, Sir!

01:13:06.192 --> 01:13:08.859
He's in a bad mood. What happened?

01:13:18.668 --> 01:13:20.876
What's this dirty bag?

01:13:21.043 --> 01:13:23.418
Shut up!
Go home!

01:13:35.543 --> 01:13:37.835
There's a letter for Mr. Kato.

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:40.960
It's from Mr. Harada in Tokyo.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.210
I'll take it.

01:13:46.251 --> 01:13:48.793
How're you doing?
How's Brother Yamamoto?

01:13:49.001 --> 01:13:52.085
I've had troubles

01:13:52.251 --> 01:13:54.668
but I have my own family now.

01:13:54.835 --> 01:13:58.585
I owe it all to him

01:13:58.751 --> 01:14:00.585
that I've come this far as an outsider.

01:14:08.501 --> 01:14:12.085
That's some finger you had made.

01:14:12.251 --> 01:14:14.710
Wearing that, you won't
be thrown out of golf clubs?

01:15:11.501 --> 01:15:15.168
Mr. Harada and boss
sure are prosperous.

01:15:16.085 --> 01:15:19.126
Being an outsider,
it wasn't easy.

01:15:23.293 --> 01:15:27.835
Because of your efforts
we've grown bigger.

01:15:29.126 --> 01:15:30.751
Keep up the good work

01:15:32.001 --> 01:15:33.460
and no rivalry.

01:15:36.043 --> 01:15:37.418
But, Boss!

01:15:39.085 --> 01:15:42.251
Since there's an outsider among us
it's hard to tell

01:15:42.418 --> 01:15:45.668
what he's hiding inside him.

01:15:56.876 --> 01:15:58.001
Matsumoto,

01:15:59.001 --> 01:16:00.960
are you talking about me?

01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:04.251
Do you want to take a look

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:06.418
at what's in my stomach?

01:16:07.876 --> 01:16:09.793
Bring me a knife!

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.543
See for yourself!

01:16:31.867 --> 01:16:33.906
(Groaning)

01:16:42.251 --> 01:16:43.626
Take him away!

01:17:00.376 --> 01:17:01.335
Matsumoto,

01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:04.835
you tarnished this celebration.

01:17:06.293 --> 01:17:08.168
I demand you take

01:17:09.085 --> 01:17:10.251
responsibility for this!

01:17:10.418 --> 01:17:12.001
Sorry, Sir!

01:17:36.668 --> 01:17:40.126
Please forgive me with this.

01:17:49.001 --> 01:17:51.543
The Mafia is harassing us.

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:56.001
Should we give them a share?

01:17:56.543 --> 01:17:59.085
They're demanding half,
aren't they?

01:18:00.626 --> 01:18:02.418
Well? Sugimoto?

01:18:04.668 --> 01:18:07.751
20% is the limit.

01:18:17.495 --> 01:18:19.202
(Man) 'We got your woman.

01:18:19.287 --> 01:18:22.488
'Come to the Sixth Street bridge.
Come alone.'

01:18:44.251 --> 01:18:48.543
Where is he going?
- Home … I guess.

01:18:51.289 --> 01:18:53.245
Shouldn't you take him home?

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.699
He doesn't want me to know
where he lives.

01:18:57.789 --> 01:19:00.989
(Shirase) Ah …
That's playing it safe, huh?

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:13.613
(Groans)

01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:41.165
Isn't Aniki coming?

01:19:41.248 --> 01:19:44.662
No, he's got something
to take care of.

01:19:44.748 --> 01:19:46.159
Shit!

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:47.659
You know,

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:51.744
he should pay more attention
to the family business.

01:20:05.124 --> 01:20:09.450
Hey. The Mafia says
20% is not acceptable.

01:20:09.541 --> 01:20:12.908
- They want 50%.
- Well, fuck them!

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.577
What shall we do?

01:20:16.208 --> 01:20:18.330
It's war.

01:20:18.417 --> 01:20:22.115
Fuck with the Italians,
we'll be asking for trouble.

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.785
(Mo) We'll all die.

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:26.745
I'm a Yakuza from the old school.

01:20:26.834 --> 01:20:31.326
If I have to die, so be it.

01:20:31.417 --> 01:20:33.492
(Man) Freeze!

01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:50.499
- Bring him over here.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.786
Who sent you?

01:20:58.961 --> 01:21:00.584
Which family?

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.039
(Screams)

01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:58.792
Aniki?

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:03.294
You OK?

01:22:07.426 --> 01:22:10.177
You don't look too good, man.
Gonna eat?

01:22:14.343 --> 01:22:18.042
Denny … Run away.

01:22:18.136 --> 01:22:20.672
What?

01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:22.800
Where to?

01:22:22.886 --> 01:22:26.253
Hm. Here, eat it.

01:22:29.886 --> 01:22:31.926
Really?

01:22:33.137 --> 01:22:34.844
All right.

01:22:38.585 --> 01:22:40.418
So … It's war.

01:23:11.808 --> 01:23:14.926
Hey, boys. Here's to the boss.

01:23:15.017 --> 01:23:17.589
Hey, to Don, congratulations.

01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:22.767
That's not bad, is it?

01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:25.056
(Chatter and laughter)

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.563
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:23:54.312 --> 01:23:56.434
(Gasping and choking)

01:24:18.899 --> 01:24:22.229
(Shirase) We just killed
Geppetti, so it's war.

01:24:23.648 --> 01:24:25.307
You better be ready.

01:24:25.398 --> 01:24:28.149
The Mafia will torture you to death.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:33.729
If you get caught,
take one of these.

01:24:35.192 --> 01:24:38.392
You'll die quickly without pain.

01:24:43.526 --> 01:24:45.103
Aniki.

01:24:45.193 --> 01:24:48.026
You and I,
we don't need this shit, right?

01:25:05.251 --> 01:25:07.001
It's over.

01:25:07.751 --> 01:25:09.210
We'll all die.

01:25:40.115 --> 01:25:42.522
What a terrible thing to do.

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.195
- Clean it up.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:05.366
(Jay clears throat)

01:26:26.536 --> 01:26:28.576
(Explosion)

01:26:44.413 --> 01:26:46.239
Aniki.

01:27:11.999 --> 01:27:14.833
We are going to avenge
Aniki's death.

01:27:14.916 --> 01:27:17.121
Don't even think about running.

01:27:41.711 --> 01:27:43.501
(Man) Denny, gimme my 9mm!

01:27:43.586 --> 01:27:47.581
OK, buddy, let's go. Colin. Colin!

01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:49.377
So, he's dead.

01:27:49.462 --> 01:27:51.169
(Shouting and gunfire)

01:27:54.463 --> 01:27:56.703
(Heavy gunfire)

01:28:25.924 --> 01:28:27.963
(Shouting)

01:28:35.633 --> 01:28:37.839
(Screaming and gunfire)

01:29:21.668 --> 01:29:22.793
Let's go.

01:29:27.251 --> 01:29:30.376
Mr. Sugimoto,
you can leave now.

01:29:30.543 --> 01:29:32.251
We're closing the office.

01:29:32.418 --> 01:29:36.585
I want to update the books
through today.

01:29:41.335 --> 01:29:44.251
What's that?
- Clothes.

01:29:44.682 --> 01:29:46.638
- What is it?
- Some clothes.

01:29:46.724 --> 01:29:49.344
Let's go
to my mother's house for now.

01:29:49.433 --> 01:29:51.259
OK. Go.

01:30:29.437 --> 01:30:31.429
Wait here.

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:45.141
Ma!

01:30:46.939 --> 01:30:48.433
Ma!

01:30:48.522 --> 01:30:51.094
(Denny) Oh, God … Oh, God.

01:30:52.523 --> 01:30:55.060
Oh, God … Oh, God.

01:31:00.335 --> 01:31:04.335
Aniki, we're finished.
I'm leaving town.

01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:06.418
Up to you.

01:31:07.293 --> 01:31:08.876
What about you?

01:31:09.043 --> 01:31:10.460
I'm staying.

01:31:25.568 --> 01:31:31.020
Oh, God. Oh, God. (Sobbing)

01:31:35.361 --> 01:31:39.225
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:31:43.862 --> 01:31:45.937
(Door buzzer)

01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:04.775
Jay, run!

01:32:07.239 --> 01:32:08.816
(Gunshots)

01:33:31.126 --> 01:33:34.085
DEATH

01:34:08.585 --> 01:34:11.454
There's only one of 'em.

01:34:12.710 --> 01:34:14.536
Let's go.

01:34:16.252 --> 01:34:20.032
Aniki, you don't have
to do this, you know?

01:34:20.126 --> 01:34:22.164
This is my business.

01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:18.402
Denny, OK, go ahead.

01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:24.744
Ahh! Ahh! Oh, God!

01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:28.197
(Denny) Oh! Oh, God!

01:35:28.288 --> 01:35:31.038
Oh! Oh, God have mercy!

01:35:31.122 --> 01:35:32.746
(Denny groaning)

01:35:35.788 --> 01:35:37.827
(Guard) Hey, it's all right.

01:36:30.035 --> 01:36:32.241
So what do you wanna do with him?

01:37:31.116 --> 01:37:34.364
All right, here's how it works.

01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:38.489
Now, one of these five strings
is attached to the trigger.

01:37:38.572 --> 01:37:40.196
You get to choose three.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.940
If none of 'em pull …

01:37:44.155 --> 01:37:47.024
we'll let you go, honestly.

01:37:47.114 --> 01:37:50.148
All right?
Now go ahead, choose three.

01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:55.821
(Denny) Come on.

01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:59.567
Come on!

01:37:59.655 --> 01:38:01.612
Pick one!

01:38:03.322 --> 01:38:05.693
The first one. On the left!

01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:07.736
This one? All right.

01:38:11.779 --> 01:38:14.067
All right. Choose another one.

01:38:17.696 --> 01:38:19.522
Come on!

01:38:19.613 --> 01:38:23.986
(Sighing) Ah … fifth one.

01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:27.519
Fifth? One, two,
three, four, five …

01:38:33.195 --> 01:38:36.561
Pretty lucky guy!
All right, last one.

01:38:48.361 --> 01:38:49.819
Come on, come on!

01:38:49.902 --> 01:38:52.937
- The second one.
- Second.

01:38:59.819 --> 01:39:03.434
God damn son of a bitch!
You motherfuckers!

01:39:43.774 --> 01:39:46.560
Get out. Get out!

01:39:51.233 --> 01:39:54.645
- Come on. Come on!
- What are you doing?

01:40:35.813 --> 01:40:37.935
(Gunshots)

01:40:42.729 --> 01:40:46.640
Here. Take it. Run away.

01:40:57.686 --> 01:41:00.140
Denny, your eye …

01:41:02.228 --> 01:41:04.385
I did it.

01:41:09.103 --> 01:41:11.474
Yeah, I know, my brother.

01:41:32.351 --> 01:41:34.840
You even killed
one of your own men.

01:41:37.142 --> 01:41:39.549
You evil son of a bitch, you.

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.257
(Phone)

01:42:57.679 --> 01:42:59.718
(Ringing continues)

01:43:07.512 --> 01:43:09.551
(Ringing stops)

01:43:14.751 --> 01:43:17.126
Are you Japanese?

01:43:19.043 --> 01:43:20.793
Here on business?

01:43:28.803 --> 01:43:33.177
You Japanese are so inscrutable.

01:43:40.595 --> 01:43:42.633
(Cars outside)

01:44:08.293 --> 01:44:10.043
For the repairs.

01:46:14.876 --> 01:46:17.662
Run away?

01:46:17.751 --> 01:46:19.992
Fucking run away?

01:46:20.085 --> 01:46:23.582
Where the fuck am I supposed
to run to, huh? Run where?

01:46:23.668 --> 01:46:27.709
These motherfuckers are gonna
kill me no matter where I go.

01:46:27.792 --> 01:46:29.747
Fucking shit.

01:46:29.833 --> 01:46:31.955
My whole life is fucked up, man!

01:46:32.041 --> 01:46:34.162
Just fucked up!

01:46:35.582 --> 01:46:37.323
Oh, shit!

01:46:37.414 --> 01:46:41.738
I was better off dealing on the
fucking corner, I swear to God.

01:46:41.829 --> 01:46:44.945
What the fuck? What am I doing?

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.993
And you give me some
fucking stink-ass gym bag

01:46:51.076 --> 01:46:53.363
full of stinky-ass clothes, huh?

01:46:53.451 --> 01:46:57.030
What the fuck are you telling
me, die in clean underwear?

01:46:57.116 --> 01:46:58.941
Huh?

01:46:59.032 --> 01:47:02.231
Fucking sick Japanese
tradition or some shit?

01:47:02.323 --> 01:47:04.231
Oh, you fucking …

01:47:04.323 --> 01:47:06.148
Fuck!

01:47:08.362 --> 01:47:10.981
What the fuck
is in this shit, anyway?

01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:17.609
Oh, shit.

01:47:17.693 --> 01:47:22.895
Holy shit! Holy shit!

01:47:22.983 --> 01:47:25.021
Oh, shit!

01:47:35.646 --> 01:47:38.844
"Here's the $60
I owe you for cheating,

01:47:38.936 --> 01:47:40.809
"plus interest for you.

01:47:42.810 --> 01:47:44.885
"Your brother, Yamamoto."

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:51.590
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, man.

01:47:53.765 --> 01:47:56.882
Oh, shit, man. Fuck you!

01:47:56.972 --> 01:47:59.178
Fuck you, man!

01:48:00.763 --> 01:48:02.589
Fuck!

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:09.666
Fucking shit. God damn it!

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.751
Oh, shit!

01:48:12.926 --> 01:48:16.256
Whoo. Holy shit!

01:48:17.466 --> 01:48:19.623
Oh, shit.

01:48:19.715 --> 01:48:22.169
Oh, man.

01:48:24.298 --> 01:48:26.537
Son of a bitch.

01:48:29.754 --> 01:48:31.959
God damn, I love you, man.

01:48:34.835 --> 01:48:37.869
I love you, Aniki,
wherever you're at, man!

01:53:07.835 --> 01:53:11.698
