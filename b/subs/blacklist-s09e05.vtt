WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.130
[Olivia] <i>Stan, you need</i>
<i>to get here as fast as you can.</i>

00:05.213 --> 00:06.089
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

00:06.172 --> 00:08.883
For all we know,
CID already has him in custody.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.720
Yeah? Then why haven't we heard
from Nitesh or Maryanne?

00:11.803 --> 00:14.264
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.725
<i>There were ambulances at the safe house.</i>

00:16.808 --> 00:19.019
Sit tight. I'll be at the motel soon.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.396
-We'll talk to Hans.
-[device clicking]

00:23.189 --> 00:24.357
[grunting]

00:24.441 --> 00:25.984
No. [clears throat]

00:26.568 --> 00:27.902
It can't be.

00:27.986 --> 00:28.987
<i>Can't be what?</i>

00:29.070 --> 00:30.196
Can't be what?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.614
Him. He's here.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.951
<i>Oh, my God. Stan.</i>
<i>You have to get out of there.</i>

00:35.618 --> 00:37.203
[groaning]

00:40.623 --> 00:41.624
<i>Stan?</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:43.626
<i>Are you there? Stan!</i>

00:48.381 --> 00:49.549
[shouting]

00:52.927 --> 00:53.762
Stan?

00:54.637 --> 00:55.930
Stan!

01:24.667 --> 01:27.045
I'm just saying I don't understand.

01:27.128 --> 01:30.924
The way you're saying it
sounds like you don't trust me.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.968
Then let me start over.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.345
I love you.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.763
And whatever this is--

01:36.846 --> 01:38.765
-This is cancer.
-Maybe.

01:38.848 --> 01:42.185
That's why you got the blood test.
To get a second opinion.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.353
What I don't understand

01:43.436 --> 01:46.815
is why the bureau wouldn't let you
give the oncologist the drug test.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.233
I don't know.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.443
I know you're an amazing instructor,

01:50.527 --> 01:52.987
but would our national security
really be at risk

01:53.071 --> 01:55.365
if someone else trained the cadets?

01:55.448 --> 01:56.366
What can I say?

01:56.950 --> 01:57.867
I'm that good.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.795
When you stopped being a field agent,
I thought you were safe.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.796
Now this.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.091
I wish I could protect you.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.342
You do.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.136
In every way that matters.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.769
Hey.

02:24.853 --> 02:25.854
I do trust you.

02:40.827 --> 02:41.828
[knocking on door]

02:44.247 --> 02:45.874
I'm here to see Raymond.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.628
He said it was urgent.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.339
Raymond is troubled.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.301
Some man and his airfields.

02:56.384 --> 02:57.594
Jovan Lović?

02:57.677 --> 02:59.554
Raymond wanted to meet.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.515
The man refused because of you.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.684
Me?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.856
I didn't do this to hurt him.

03:12.066 --> 03:12.901
Dembe.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.779
The Havana Syndrome.
What do you know about it?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.865
It's a series of ailments.

03:20.074 --> 03:24.245
Headaches, fatigue,
vertigo, blurred vision,

03:24.329 --> 03:27.165
first reported
by American diplomats in Cuba,

03:27.248 --> 03:30.418
later by U.S. personnel
in embassies around the world.

03:30.501 --> 03:34.881
Mysterious ailments
caused by a mysterious weapon.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.758
A directed-energy weapon.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.676
Mierce, those are delicious.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.761
You are a wonder.

03:39.844 --> 03:43.306
I can't imagine a life
without either of them.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.602
Mystery weapon.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.021
Do you know how to locate one?

03:50.104 --> 03:52.607
I know that one has recently gone missing.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.735
One that this country
and this country's enemies

03:55.818 --> 03:57.779
would love to get their hands on.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.198
I thought the weapons
were made by our enemies.

04:00.281 --> 04:04.953
Well, in the Yankee-Doodle spirit of,
"Any way you can kill, I can kill better,"

04:05.036 --> 04:08.206
the Americans transformed
Cuba's peashooter model

04:08.289 --> 04:12.543
into a particularly fearsome iteration
that has the potential to usher in

04:12.627 --> 04:15.129
a brutal new form of guerrilla warfare.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.425
-About Jovan Lović--
-Lović is my problem.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.595
The problem you should focus on
is finding this weapon.

04:25.223 --> 04:28.851
These weapons can disable people
by sending highly powered energy waves

04:28.935 --> 04:32.146
through walls, floors, ceilings
without detection.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.481
According to Raymond,

04:33.564 --> 04:36.276
the Pentagon responded to the attacks

04:36.359 --> 04:38.611
by tasking DARPA to design one.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.612
Which they did,

04:39.696 --> 04:42.865
only for the chief engineer to disappear
along with the prototype.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.076
What do we know about him?

04:45.159 --> 04:47.745
His name is Dr. Benjamin Okara.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.124
Immigrated to the U.S.
from Lagos when he was 10.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.459
Agent Park. Welcome to the party.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.504
Sorry, I got in my car
and ended up at the academy.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.505
Habit, I guess.

04:57.588 --> 05:01.509
Okara has a PhD
in electrical engineering from MIT,

05:01.592 --> 05:04.012
where he won the unusual distinction

05:04.095 --> 05:08.224
of being the only summa cum laude graduate
to have been suspended four times.

05:08.308 --> 05:12.645
The last one was for assembling
a Zamboni in the faculty dining hall.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.065
AI-enabled target processing,
hypersonic missile defense.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.358
Quite the résumé.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.152
Did Reddington say why he went rogue?

05:19.235 --> 05:22.030
[Dembe] <i>Only that the weapon can fetch</i>
<i>a fortune on the black market.</i>

05:22.113 --> 05:25.241
<i>It's equally possible</i>
<i>he's been turned. We don't know.</i>

05:25.325 --> 05:28.786
We may not know his motives,
but we can find out about the weapon.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.830
Park, Ressler, get over to DARPA.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.790
We need to know what this is capable of.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.253
What are you doing here?

05:37.336 --> 05:38.671
You sound like Peter.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.173
You told him. Good.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.215
Of course.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.301
Then I lied about how I found out

05:43.384 --> 05:45.762
and why I couldn't give
the oncologist my drug test.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.222
Because it was my test using your urine.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.267
Which, if you hadn't given,
you wouldn't know something was wrong.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.436
So you're welcome.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.943
Agents Ressler and Park are here.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.863
Please come in. Your office called to say
you were on your way.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.823
-You know why we're here.
-I do. As I told

06:05.907 --> 06:08.910
the gentleman I spoke with,
I can't comment on classified projects.

06:08.993 --> 06:12.455
We know about the directed-energy weapon.
That Okara supervised it.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.624
That he's taken it
and gone who knows where.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.627
We were kind of hoping
you were the who who knows.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.671
I'm sorry, but I can't confirm or deny

06:20.755 --> 06:23.257
even the existence of classified projects.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.675
What about the scientists?

06:24.759 --> 06:27.303
<i>Can you tell us who worked on the project?</i>

06:27.386 --> 06:29.847
<i>Or if the military has begun</i>
<i>an investigation?</i>

06:29.931 --> 06:31.099
[Reiss] <i>I wish I could.</i>

06:31.182 --> 06:35.019
I can't even speculate
about personnel or investigations

06:35.103 --> 06:37.980
that may or may not be connected
to classified projects

06:38.064 --> 06:39.357
that may or may not exist.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.067
You know what isn't speculative?

06:41.150 --> 06:42.485
A powerful weapon is missing.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.362
It could do incredible damage.

06:44.445 --> 06:48.699
You're too busy covering your ass
to help us prevent that from happening.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.159
I'm late for a meeting.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.161
Alison will show you out.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.251
DARPA is investigating.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.753
-Sorry?
-The project's secret

07:00.837 --> 07:02.964
and they don't want any leaks,

07:03.047 --> 07:06.300
but Reiss has been on the phone
with investigators every day this week.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.178
-There were five scientists.
-Were?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.764
Stan Rogers was killed in a car crash.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.057
What about the others?

07:13.141 --> 07:15.393
No one knows.
It's like they all disappeared.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.061
[Park] The whole team is missing?

07:17.145 --> 07:20.106
We need their names. Can you do that?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.400
[cell phone ringing]

07:23.151 --> 07:24.944
Hans? Listen, Stan's missing--

07:25.027 --> 07:26.904
[male voice] <i>Desert. Ash. Beware.</i>

07:36.497 --> 07:37.999
Oh, my God.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.171
-[device clicking]
-[shouting]

08:06.611 --> 08:07.862
[Cooper] The ballistics match.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.865
The ones from the report
and my service weapon.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.159
It doesn't mean you did it.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.745
The bullet that shot Doug Koster
came from my gun.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.163
<i>It's been eight years.</i>

08:17.246 --> 08:20.666
He's in our past. What?
You get drunk and kill him?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.877
I went to the precinct.
I was gonna confess.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.795
I can't remember what happened.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.380
<i>I wish you had.</i>

08:26.464 --> 08:27.507
Turned myself in?

08:27.590 --> 08:28.633
Told the truth.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.719
If you don't and they find the ballistics,

08:31.802 --> 08:33.679
no one's gonna believe you're innocent.

08:34.805 --> 08:35.723
[knocking on door]

08:36.557 --> 08:37.517
Oh. Sorry.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.727
We have an update on the scientists.

08:39.810 --> 08:40.978
I'll be right down.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.695
I sent a blood sample
to find out if I was drugged.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.906
-When will you get the results?
<i>-A week.</i>

08:51.989 --> 08:54.784
Maybe more. Until then,
I'm not admitting to anything.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.037
-If the police find out--
<i>-A friend ran ballistics.</i>

08:58.120 --> 09:00.081
No one else knows. No one's gonna know.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.874
We have a lot to worry about,

09:01.958 --> 09:05.127
but the police finding out
about my involvement isn't one of them.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.587
I'll talk to you later.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.714
First, the scientists.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.758
Olivia Martinez, Nitesh Shah.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.344
Maryanne Sims, Hans Fielder, Stan Rodgers.

09:13.427 --> 09:16.806
All worked for Okara.
As of yesterday, all are missing.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.599
Next, cause of death.

09:18.683 --> 09:22.103
The radiologist who examined Rodgers
says his brain damage is worse

09:22.186 --> 09:23.813
than what he suffered in the crash.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.232
Meaning Okara
may have used the prototype on him.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.317
Why would Okara do that?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.444
Use it on a colleague?

09:30.528 --> 09:32.905
If his goal was to sell it,
that makes no sense.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.576
They know how the device works.
If he gets rid of them,

09:36.659 --> 09:39.620
he secures exclusive access for his buyer.

09:39.704 --> 09:43.374
And provides a demonstration
of the technology's capabilities.

09:43.457 --> 09:46.502
Okay. I just hung up
with Olivia Martinez's husband.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.088
He spoke to her last night.
She was scared.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.091
All she'd say was she was at a motel
waiting to meet a colleague.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.551
I back-traced the call.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.469
Her burner pinged a tower in South East

09:55.553 --> 09:57.847
that covers 30 square blocks
with two motels.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.640
One's closed for renovations.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.768
The other is the Oak Leaf
on Rhode Island and 6th.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.270
[suspenseful music playing]

10:14.071 --> 10:15.823
[Raymond] Jovan, this is an easy deal.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.533
You have my old airfields.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.244
I have business
that requires access to them.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.623
Now, I'm told you have concerns,
so let me assure you,

10:23.706 --> 10:26.459
the sudden conversion
of a former colleague

10:26.542 --> 10:28.502
will absolutely not interfere

10:28.586 --> 10:31.088
with an otherwise
profitable collaboration.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.757
He converted to a federal agent.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.801
Yes. And as a result,
has been entirely cut off.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.846
From my operations, my accounts,
my whereabouts

10:38.929 --> 10:41.432
and all the people I do business with.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.892
So you say.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.269
But how can we be sure
you're not still in contact?

10:45.353 --> 10:46.729
[Raymond] I am still in contact.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.565
Believe me, having him at an arm's length

10:49.649 --> 10:52.151
is better than having him sneak behind me.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.736
He will not be a problem.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.196
We need to be sure.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.490
Killing him would be sure.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.868
Killing an FBI agent,
under any circumstances,

11:00.951 --> 11:03.329
is proof of only one thing, stupidity.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.748
Killing an agent
who was a former associate

11:05.831 --> 11:07.958
is both stupid and bad business.

11:08.042 --> 11:12.129
They'd assign even more than
the usual number of buzz-cuts to find me,

11:12.213 --> 11:14.590
which might jeopardize
our collaboration.

11:14.673 --> 11:17.635
So unless there are any
other helpful suggestions--

11:17.718 --> 11:19.053
You calling me stupid?

11:19.136 --> 11:20.513
[in Serbian] More or less.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.224
[in English]
I'm not sure the idiom translates. So yes.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.479
Cute, isn't she? You should
see what she does with a chicken.

11:28.562 --> 11:32.691
Wrings it, bleeds it and plucks it
before it ever knows it was dead.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.406
Do you have a proposal?

11:38.489 --> 11:40.866
In exchange for access to the airfields,

11:40.950 --> 11:42.952
I'll settle your dispute with Jilal,

11:43.035 --> 11:45.996
guarantee safe passage for your product,

11:46.080 --> 11:49.792
and secure a place for your granddaughter
in Brearley's kindergarten class.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.085
Run the numbers.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.754
I think you'll find
your profits will soar,

11:53.838 --> 11:57.133
to say nothing
of Desanka's block-building skills.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.760
I will consider it.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.680
While you do, consider this.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.307
Dembe Zuma is my responsibility.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.184
If anything is to be done,

12:07.268 --> 12:09.311
good or bad,

12:09.395 --> 12:11.063
I will be the one doing it.

12:15.234 --> 12:19.238
I lied about my drug test
to hide an addiction I'm trying to break.

12:19.321 --> 12:24.201
I'm not proud of it but there is a certain
amount of twisted internal logic.

12:24.285 --> 12:28.164
But what you're doing,
there's no logic to it at all.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.292
You tell Peter about the diagnosis
but not the job.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.170
You tell Cooper about the job
but not the diagnosis.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.672
Except for me, you're hiding
something from everyone.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.841
What makes you think
I'm not hiding something?

12:38.924 --> 12:42.720
There's only so many deceptions
you can squeeze into one day.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.388
I'm not deceiving you.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.266
I'm just holding back.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.684
What?

12:49.810 --> 12:51.103
The floodgates.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.398
What do you mean, like tears?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.194
Men. Honestly.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.005
-[knocking on door]
-[Park] FBI!

13:18.088 --> 13:20.799
Olivia, can you hear me? Are you in there?

13:20.883 --> 13:22.092
[suspenseful music playing]

13:30.351 --> 13:31.810
She's dead.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.110
911 operator.
This is Agent Park with the FBI.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.571
I need police to respond to my location.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.843
You got a call.
Patched through from Hoover.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.512
Anything from the motel?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.265
We were too late.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.766
Olivia Martinez is dead.

14:10.849 --> 14:14.311
The desk manager's badly injured
and Okara is gone.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.022
I wanna see Park and Ressler
as soon as they get back.

14:18.732 --> 14:19.984
Harold Cooper.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.112
[Heber over phone] <i>Yeah, hi.</i>
<i>This is Detective Marcus Heber, MPD.</i>

14:23.195 --> 14:24.780
How can I help you?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.615
<i>I was hoping I could ask you</i>
<i>a few questions.</i>

14:26.699 --> 14:28.534
Oh? What about?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.244
<i>The murder of Doug Koster.</i>

14:37.543 --> 14:39.169
[Ressler] There's one dead, four injured.

14:39.253 --> 14:43.257
Martinez in Room 29, the guests
in Rooms 28 and 30, plus the manager.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.509
We don't have a cause of death,
but the symptoms

14:45.593 --> 14:47.720
are consistent with directed energy.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.764
[Ressler] Okara aimed at Martinez
and the others suffered peripheral damage.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.433
Significant but not fatal.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.144
We're pulling CCTV.
We'll compare it to what we have

14:55.227 --> 14:57.396
from where Okara's first victim was.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.815
-Still no cooperation from DARPA?
-None.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.694
The Pentagon locked down the scene,
sent in CID investigators.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.362
There was a notepad.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.781
Top page was blank but it had markings.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.160
So we traced them
and came up with some kind of code,

15:11.243 --> 15:13.412
something Martinez may have written down.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.624
It's three words. "Desert, ash, beware."

15:16.707 --> 15:19.460
The slashes made us think
it was a website.

15:19.543 --> 15:23.923
All we got were a list of movies
to beware of watching on a desert island.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.174
It's not a website.

15:25.674 --> 15:26.967
It's an app.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.595
-Do you know what it means?
-Not yet.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.932
But the app is called WordWorld3.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.392
And it is a way to communicate locations

15:35.476 --> 15:38.771
by converting GPS coordinates
into three-word addresses.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.689
"Desert, ash, beware" is a place?

15:40.773 --> 15:44.360
[Aram] The app divides the world
into 57 trillion 9-meter squares.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.779
That is trillion with a T.

15:47.279 --> 15:51.492
And this one is at 4453 Wentworth Ave.

15:51.575 --> 15:55.371
Olivia's husband said she was
looking for a place to hide.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.457
She didn't get there, but maybe some
of her colleagues did?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.125
Sir?

16:01.085 --> 16:02.878
Right. Uh, Wentworth Avenue.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.381
Park, Agent Zuma, see what you can find.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.720
Detective.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.764
Thanks for coming.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.265
Let's talk in my office.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.601
A for...

16:19.478 --> 16:20.729
That's gonna be good.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.564
E.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.994
That's a gun in your back.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.664
In case you're wondering,

16:38.747 --> 16:41.500
on the off chance
you're capable of wonder,

16:42.001 --> 16:44.169
I have eyes
in the back of my head.

16:44.253 --> 16:49.550
I don't draw a breath without knowing
my perimeter is secure.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.552
It's why I'm still alive

16:51.635 --> 16:54.680
and it's why we made you
about an hour ago.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.559
So why are you here?

16:58.642 --> 16:59.893
Is it Dembe?

17:00.561 --> 17:05.983
Or does Jovan think I'm angling
for his used-to-be-mine airfields?

17:06.066 --> 17:09.528
Or is this about me calling you stupid?

17:09.611 --> 17:11.488
Which, under the circumstances,

17:11.572 --> 17:14.366
I think you'll agree
was a gross understatement.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.284
Go to hell.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.201
Someday.

17:17.661 --> 17:20.039
Weecha, it's time to feed the armadillo.

17:21.832 --> 17:22.666
After you.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.087
We've met before. Outside Koster's house.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.589
Yes. The morning after.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.175
Said you were there to see
what the commotion was about.

17:31.675 --> 17:35.012
Seemed there was more
so I jotted down your plate number.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.097
Imagine my surprise to learn you're FBI,

17:37.181 --> 17:40.350
and someone I gotta sign an NDA
just to get in to see.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.854
You're doing something important
so I don't wanna take up too much time.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.356
Doug was my neighbor for many years.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.402
When I heard he'd been killed,
I drove by to see what was going on.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.112
You and Koster were close?

17:52.696 --> 17:53.947
Not particularly.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.619
Doug and my wife had an affair years ago.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.789
Though I suspect you already know.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.458
Mr. Koster's body
was found in the doorway.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.126
No sign of forced entry.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.920
Seemed like he knew the person.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.671
I wasn't fond of the man.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.257
I wasn't near his house the night he died.

18:12.341 --> 18:16.053
I was at a retirement party
at the Tap Room on U Street.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.556
ME's report has time of death
between 3 and 5 a.m.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.767
Pretty late for a retirement party.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.393
I left around 11.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.436
Went straight home.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.522
Was anyone there? At home?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.524
It's not an alibi.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.275
It's the truth.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.777
I'm sure it is.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.695
But you know how this works.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.740
I was with my wife.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.357
[Hans] Olivia?

19:12.776 --> 19:14.153
Olivia, is that you?

19:17.364 --> 19:19.032
-Drop the gun!
-Put the gun down!

19:19.116 --> 19:20.826
-Drop the gun!
-Put it down!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.999
We're FBI agents.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.625
Hans, right?

19:28.709 --> 19:29.793
Hans Fielder?

19:29.877 --> 19:32.546
-How did you find me?
-Desert, ash, beware.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.382
We found the message in Olivia's room.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.383
You saw her.

19:36.925 --> 19:37.926
Is she all right?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.095
Olivia is dead.

19:40.888 --> 19:41.972
Please.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.557
We're here to help.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.893
I'm sorry but is everything all right?

19:45.976 --> 19:46.977
It's fine.

19:47.060 --> 19:51.023
Good. I didn't know if the officer
was here about Charlene's friend.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.399
The footage. Tell me.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.943
Right, a blue van was in both,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.529
the plates are bogus,
the registration is to a P.O. Box.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.324
Pull the financials on the box,
put out an APB on the van.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.910
If we find it, we find Okara.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.203
Ben was our friend.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.456
He knew why this weapon
should never be used.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.042
It was used against him in Cuba.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.211
He worked in the Havana embassy?

20:12.294 --> 20:14.838
[Hans] <i>He was sent there to study</i>
<i>the effects of the weapon.</i>

20:14.922 --> 20:16.924
<i>When he got back, he had them too.</i>

20:17.007 --> 20:19.718
<i>Tremors, light sensitivity, headaches.</i>

20:19.801 --> 20:23.805
[Park] <i>So he comes to DARPA to build</i>
<i>an even more powerful weapon, steals it</i>

20:23.889 --> 20:26.308
<i>and turns it on his colleagues</i>
<i>you say he cares about.</i>

20:26.391 --> 20:29.645
[Hans] <i>He did more than steal it.</i>
<i>He wiped our research from the database.</i>

20:29.728 --> 20:32.898
Even if DARPA wanted to rebuild it,
they wouldn't know how.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.233
And the wire?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.568
We also found this in Olivia's room.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.029
We thought metal would absorb the energy

20:39.112 --> 20:41.240
and act as an early warning system.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.076
When it glows,
we'd know an attack was about to begin.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.410
[cell phone ringing]

20:46.161 --> 20:47.120
It's Aram.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.538
I'll take it outside.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.376
We're gonna take you in. Keep you safe.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.211
Not until I find the others.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.964
I won't leave Nitesh and Maryanne.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.715
He found Stan and Olivia.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.760
-I can't let him find them.
-To prevent that, you need to help us.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.680
And that starts by letting us take you in.
It's not safe here.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.182
Okay.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.475
Can I grab my phone?

21:08.976 --> 21:10.310
We found Hans Fielder.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.520
He needs protection.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.605
A safe house until this is over.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.108
[Aram] <i>I'll make the arrangements.</i>
<i>Here's what we know.</i>

21:16.942 --> 21:18.527
All right. I'm ready.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.080

[tires screeching]

22:26.303 --> 22:27.304
Alina!

22:34.436 --> 22:35.979
Alina, don't move.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.067
This is Zuma.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.403
I need a Level 2 activation in Madison,
Virginia, code Echo-Charlie-One.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.030
[Herbert] <i>That code is no longer valid.</i>

22:45.113 --> 22:47.157
-Herbert, you know me.
<i>-I need a valid code.</i>

22:47.240 --> 22:49.201
Damn it. Send the helicopter now!

22:51.119 --> 22:52.829
<i>Chopper inbound, ten minutes.</i>

23:01.546 --> 23:04.007
I told you, I wrote it all down.

23:04.091 --> 23:07.886
Teddy is recovering from
a valve replacement in Rochester.

23:07.969 --> 23:12.390
Edna's with him there, so she asked
if their son, Geoffrey, can fill in.

23:12.474 --> 23:15.519
I'll remember the nipples,
I swear. Don't get Dad--

23:16.895 --> 23:18.855
Edna? It's Raymond.

23:19.397 --> 23:20.398
Yes.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.151
Listen, Geoffrey will be fine,

23:23.235 --> 23:27.697
so please, wish Teddy a <i>refuah shlema</i>
and leave the boy alone.

23:27.781 --> 23:28.990
Thank you, Edna.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.285
-Why no armadillo?
-Dad says I'm not ready for mammals.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.831
The shellfish will suffice.
Can we get you anything else?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.795
-I forgot the cracks and picks.
-Easy-peasy.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.338
[cell phone ringing]

23:43.421 --> 23:45.924
And maybe some bibs and butter to be safe.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.343
Lemon-squeezy. He's in the back.

23:50.011 --> 23:50.846
Yes?

23:53.098 --> 23:54.432
Say that again?

23:56.017 --> 23:57.185
[cell phone ringing]

24:04.025 --> 24:06.319
-Raymond.
-You're in or you're out.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.321
You can't be both. It's one or the other.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.992
-Emergency transport was too far.
-In or out?

24:12.075 --> 24:15.162
-If I had not called Herbert--
<i>-Herbert has been let go.</i>

24:15.787 --> 24:18.206
Because he helped me give Alina a chance?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.292
We still don't know
the extent of the damage.

24:20.375 --> 24:23.128
<i>I understand, and I hope</i>
<i>Agent Park makes a full recovery,</i>

24:23.211 --> 24:26.131
but perhaps I didn't explain
the extent of the problem

24:26.214 --> 24:28.675
you joining the FBI has caused.

24:28.758 --> 24:32.554
My association with the FBI
has always been difficult to conceal.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.390
But you being an agent
makes it impossible,

24:35.473 --> 24:39.644
unless you and I
strictly adhere to the rules.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.063
<i>If I do anything to assist you</i>

24:42.147 --> 24:44.608
in a way that involves
other people from my world,

24:44.691 --> 24:46.651
it could be fatal to me.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.904
Despite our recent unpleasantness,

24:48.987 --> 24:52.866
I would hope that would be
sufficient enough to stay your hand.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.289
[cell phone ringing]

24:59.372 --> 25:01.333
-Harold.
-[Cooper] <i>Agent Park owes you her life.</i>

25:01.416 --> 25:02.751
So I'm told.

25:02.834 --> 25:07.214
We traced the registration on a P.O. Box
Okara uses to an offshore account.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.216
In the days since he stole the prototype,

25:09.299 --> 25:12.302
Okara has used the account
to make multiple payments

25:12.385 --> 25:14.971
to Constantine's Meats and Cheeses.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.390
-Ah. Sherwin.
-Sherwin?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.392
Sherwin Ellis. He's Constantine.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.102
He is? A man named Sherwin?

25:21.186 --> 25:23.271
<i>-He's in the safe haven business,</i>
-[phone ringing]

25:23.355 --> 25:25.315
<i>rental spaces that are off the books</i>

25:25.398 --> 25:26.733
and under the radar.

25:26.816 --> 25:30.028
-Yours, but certainly not mine.
-[cell phone beeps]

25:31.988 --> 25:33.823
Sorry, I was in the middle of something.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.575
He called me, the detective.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.911
I know. I left you a message he would.

25:37.994 --> 25:40.163
<i>I told you to tell the truth.</i>

25:40.247 --> 25:44.209
If you didn't and the police found out,
they won't believe you.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.087
I know. Maybe I should have.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.547
Maybe? You're a cop!

25:49.631 --> 25:52.717
And maybe that's why I didn't.
I know how cops think.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.887
If it walks like a duck and quacks
like a duck, why look any further?

25:55.971 --> 25:58.056
Well, now they're looking at me.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.683
<i>To confirm your alibi.</i>

25:59.766 --> 26:01.768
<i>Which we both know is a lie.</i>

26:01.851 --> 26:05.689
Harold, I love you.
You're the most honest man that I know.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.608
But you need to tell me
if that's what you want,

26:08.692 --> 26:10.610
<i>for me to lie to the police.</i>

26:10.694 --> 26:12.237
Is that what you want?

26:15.532 --> 26:18.159
Yes. It is.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.042
Sherwin.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.253
-Thank you for coming.
-My pleasure.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.963
Crackers, picks, butter and bib?

26:30.046 --> 26:31.506
-Yep.
-[Raymond] Great.

26:33.133 --> 26:34.467
Please have a seat.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.514
I understand business is good.

26:39.597 --> 26:42.058
I asked you here because
I want to make it even better.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.311
I didn't know you were
in a position to do that.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.187
You mean my sabbatical?

26:46.271 --> 26:47.814
That's over for the time being.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.150
I'm back and looking to find
a client of yours.

26:50.233 --> 26:53.028
I have his offshore account.
You can use it to trace his name.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.030
Give me his whereabouts and I'll give--

26:55.113 --> 26:57.949
-Well, we should discuss what I give you.
-I appreciate that.

26:58.033 --> 27:01.161
And if this was two years ago,
I wouldn't hesitate.

27:01.786 --> 27:02.620
But...

27:03.621 --> 27:05.165
in our business,

27:05.248 --> 27:08.168
people don't really
come back from sabbaticals.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.128
Not with any clout, anyway.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.965
Perhaps this will convince you otherwise.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.011
You work with the Skinner.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.763
No. I am the Skinner.

27:19.846 --> 27:23.808
A venture which will require
the use of facilities around the globe.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.310
Perhaps your facilities.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.522
All I need from you is an address.

27:30.065 --> 27:34.027
Reddington got an address on Okara,
to a facility he's been renting.

27:34.110 --> 27:37.614
A machine shop in Newport News,
2804 Hazelton Road.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.408
I'll get a tac team to meet us on site.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.785
Any update on Park?

27:41.868 --> 27:46.331
She's conscious, but it's not clear
whether there'll be lasting effects.

27:46.414 --> 27:49.501
-She was out of the direct line of fire.
-Thank God.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.754
Monitor her progress.
Did you speak to her husband?

27:52.837 --> 27:56.132
I told him there'd been an accident.
He's on his way to the hospital now.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.344
But as far as he knows,
Park still works at Quantico.

27:59.427 --> 28:03.014
I tried telling her secrets
aren't healthy and won't keep.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.601
But it's easy to give advice.
It's a lot harder to take it.

28:11.606 --> 28:12.774
He talked.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.111
Turns out, his sweet spot
was between the toes.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.363
If you don't mind,
I told Mom I'd call as soon--

28:18.446 --> 28:19.906
His assignment, what was it?

28:19.989 --> 28:22.492
His boss wants to know
what to make of you and Dembe.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.786
What does he make of Dembe?

28:24.869 --> 28:27.664
That he's a fed
and that he knows too much.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.165
Jovan has ordered a hit?

28:29.249 --> 28:32.043
He knows it's happening,
but he didn't know when or where.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.879
I used Mom's go-to just to make sure.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.717
Thank you, Geoffrey.
Your parents will be very proud.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.099
-You said there are rules.
-I know.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.268
-If you veer from them--
-I know what I said.

28:48.351 --> 28:52.897
If you try to assist Dembe,
it could be fatal to you.

28:52.981 --> 28:56.192
It could be. But if I don't,
it will be fatal to Dembe.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.819
My job is to protect you.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.739
I can't do that
if you won't protect yourself.

29:01.489 --> 29:04.909
You can't sacrifice yourself for him.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.829
In the past, yes. But not today.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.164
He was in...

29:09.998 --> 29:11.416
now he's out.

29:12.208 --> 29:15.670
This is the consequence,
and you have to accept it.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.390
[tires screeching]

29:29.058 --> 29:30.894
There's the van. The van.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.899
Hands, hands. Show me your hands.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.444
Your hands where I can see them.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.489
I'll open the door, okay?
That's it. Just the door.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.576
Get your people
to the other side of the building.

29:48.369 --> 29:51.498
-You don't want to do this.
-No, I don't.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.333
But I have to.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.212
I make weapons. I know how they work.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.923
The blast radius, I'm very precise.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.550
You need to get back.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.813
I understand this is a sensitive topic.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.317
You want to know if I think
my husband murdered my ex-lover.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.111
Yes, detective,
I'd say it's quite sensitive.

30:23.822 --> 30:27.075
How did your husband find out
you and Mr. Koster were involved?

30:27.158 --> 30:28.409
I told him.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.454
The affair had been over for a while,

30:31.996 --> 30:33.915
but I couldn't keep it
a secret any longer.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.125
Did he express anger toward Mr. Koster?

30:36.209 --> 30:37.335
Of course he did.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.878
Wouldn't you?

30:39.838 --> 30:43.258
On the night of the 24th, your husband
said he was at a retirement party.

30:43.341 --> 30:46.094
-That's right.
-What time did he come home?

30:46.177 --> 30:47.887
I love my husband,

30:48.388 --> 30:49.973
but I won't lie for him.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.308
He knows that.

30:55.311 --> 30:58.189
We did what you asked.
Now get out of the van.

31:02.777 --> 31:03.611
Good.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.697
This is good. Thank you.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.992
How can we help you? What do you need?

31:09.075 --> 31:12.036
How can we resolve this
without anyone else getting hurt?

31:12.120 --> 31:13.788
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.250
What about Hans, Olivia, Stan?

31:17.333 --> 31:20.253
-You don't understand.
-[Ressler] No, we don't. So help us.

31:20.336 --> 31:23.381
Why are you killing your colleagues?
Why would you do that?

31:23.464 --> 31:25.300
They knew how to build it.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.760
You wanted to be the only one who could?

31:27.844 --> 31:30.597
So you could sell this weapon
and your ability to build it?

31:30.680 --> 31:33.474
Sell it? Is that what you think I want?

31:33.558 --> 31:35.226
You really don't understand.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.271
Is it in the van, the device?

31:38.354 --> 31:41.524
You wanna see it?
Because it's like a magic trick.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.777
A weapon that goes through walls.

31:44.861 --> 31:47.780
A tool of repression so powerful
that with the push of a button,

31:47.864 --> 31:51.784
thousands of protestors wouldn't be able
to remember how to tie their shoes,

31:51.868 --> 31:54.245
let alone what they'd been protesting.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.789
And like any good trick,
you don't just wanna see it...

31:58.625 --> 32:01.920
you wanna know how it works
so you can do it yourself.

32:02.003 --> 32:05.924
So this country can build
a thousand just like it,

32:06.007 --> 32:09.344
a weapon not of mass destruction,
but of mass...

32:10.595 --> 32:11.804
suffering.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.933
And I can't let that happen.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.435
You wanna destroy it.

32:18.311 --> 32:22.315
The magic trick and the six people
who know how to build it.

32:22.398 --> 32:23.608
Six?

32:25.318 --> 32:27.820
I killed five people I loved...

32:28.446 --> 32:31.240
to protect thousands I don't.

32:31.866 --> 32:33.409
And you're the sixth.

32:33.493 --> 32:37.163
[Aram] Someone else is gonna
figure it out, how to make what you did.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.457
You can't stop that from happening.

32:39.540 --> 32:42.418
It's more than you can see. The pain.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.881
It's in my head, my joints.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.258
My eyes.

32:52.845 --> 32:55.890
No, I can't stop it from being rebuilt.

32:57.058 --> 33:00.228
But if I bought the world
a year or two or five,

33:00.853 --> 33:01.896
that's something.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.944
It's up to you to do the rest.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.640
[Jovan] <i>There has been no contact</i>
<i>between Reddington and Zuma?</i>

33:37.724 --> 33:39.892
He hasn't been out of my sight.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.645
Then he and I can do business.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.230
[mouthing] Dembe.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.107
What about Zuma?

33:46.733 --> 33:49.527
<i>I called in a few favors,</i>
<i>found where he lives.</i>

33:49.610 --> 33:52.321
[Vasko]
<i>What happens when Reddington finds out?</i>

33:52.405 --> 33:56.451
He will thank me for doing
what he knows he should have.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.286
[cell phone beeps]

34:00.455 --> 34:01.956
Thank you. You did well.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.209
[gasping]

34:16.846 --> 34:18.139
[ominous music playing]

34:35.114 --> 34:37.075
I didn't adhere to our rules.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.327
I violated them for you.

34:39.869 --> 34:42.872
Now I need you
to violate them again for me.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.048
There, from the weapon
you won't confirm or deny,

34:52.131 --> 34:54.842
weapon that was used to kill
two scientists before we spoke,

34:54.926 --> 34:57.553
that thanks to your cover-up
was used to kill four more.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.013
It's okay. It's fine.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.265
Whatever this is,
it's beyond your purview.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.308
Six people are dead.

35:02.391 --> 35:05.311
This country is in a constant
state of war, Agent Ressler.

35:05.394 --> 35:09.065
It may not be declared, but it's being
fought by the Pentagon, not the FBI.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.484
Six people are dead
and my partner is in the ICU.

35:11.567 --> 35:12.443
Sorry to hear that.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.530
Not as sorry as you are to lose
the technology that built that.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.367
True story.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.704
Calculus was discovered
independently by Newton and Leibniz.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.374
A great leap forward
imagined simultaneously.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.377
In my experience,
great leaps forward usually are.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.046
There's someone else.

35:33.506 --> 35:36.801
You've got another team
working on directed-energy.

35:36.884 --> 35:39.178
So Okara was Newton, but Leibniz,

35:39.262 --> 35:40.763
he's still working on it.

35:40.847 --> 35:45.184
All that, everything Okara did,
you're not gonna miss a beat, are you?

35:45.268 --> 35:50.314
I cannot confirm or deny
even the existence of classified projects.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.613
Sakiya and Fudo are on their way.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.285
Jovan came for you
because you're a federal agent.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.662
He'll come for me because I protected you.

36:04.745 --> 36:05.955
How will he know?

36:06.038 --> 36:07.999
One dead, he may misread.

36:08.082 --> 36:11.961
Two dead, the tea leaves
will clearly indicate you and I are...

36:12.628 --> 36:14.714
still in cahoots.

36:14.797 --> 36:17.758
Ah. Maybe we actually are.

36:19.093 --> 36:21.846
[Dembe] I almost opened it
after Brasilia.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.807
I don't know why I didn't.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.186
Our past, I suppose.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.937
Not our future?

36:33.316 --> 36:35.693
You said you wanted something in return.

36:35.776 --> 36:39.280
You did this for me.
What do you expect me to do for you?

36:39.363 --> 36:42.158
No more, no less. An eye for an eye.

36:43.409 --> 36:44.535
Jovan.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.078
He knows about us.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.539
Or he's about to find out.

36:48.623 --> 36:52.293
I killed Sima to protect you.
Kill Jovan to protect me.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.045
I can't do that.

36:54.128 --> 36:57.590
So you're in when it suits you
and out when it doesn't?

36:58.466 --> 37:01.010
Why does it have to be
one way or the other?

37:02.011 --> 37:03.721
Why can't it just be?

37:05.556 --> 37:08.184
My old friend knew the answer to that.

37:10.811 --> 37:11.854
[knocking on door]

37:12.480 --> 37:14.273
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.358
How are you feeling?

37:15.441 --> 37:19.612
Like a sledgehammer's taken up
residence in my cerebral cortex.

37:20.529 --> 37:23.866
-Donald Ressler. We spoke on the phone.
-Yeah, we did.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.410
-So you told him.
-[Peter] Yeah, she told me.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.995
-Well, I'm glad.
-[Peter] Great.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.664
That's great.

37:29.747 --> 37:30.998
Peter.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.086
I'll be outside. It was good to meet you.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.131
Hey, doc. Been checking
your DSM on how to treat wounds

37:39.215 --> 37:41.008
from a directed-energy weapon?

37:41.092 --> 37:43.803
You do pose a challenge,
but we'll get to that.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.472

[Heber] <i>Spoke to your wife.</i>
<i>She backed up your alibi.</i>

37:51.394 --> 37:54.146
As I said,
it's not an alibi, it's the truth.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.317

37:58.401 --> 38:00.820
None. You were just doing your job.

38:01.696 --> 38:02.571
Take care.

38:05.908 --> 38:07.994
My blood test? My GP sent it over?

38:08.077 --> 38:10.496
[doctor] She did. I just got the results.

38:10.579 --> 38:13.666
Elevated levels of HCG were detected,

38:13.749 --> 38:15.710
which explains
why you weren't feeling well.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.838
So it is cancer?

38:18.921 --> 38:22.425
Elevated HCG can indicate
testicular cancer in men, but--

38:22.508 --> 38:24.385
You're saying she doesn't have cancer?

38:24.468 --> 38:26.637
No. She most definitely does not.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.808
What it means is you were pregnant.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.226
Oh, my God.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.936
What, pregnant?

38:35.229 --> 38:36.439
