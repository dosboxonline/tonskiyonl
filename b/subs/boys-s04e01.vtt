- Hey.

the meaning of the word "covert."

14:04.344 --> 14:08.223
Vic, you-you shot your own daughter up
with V? How could you do that to her?

14:08.223 --> 14:10.225
- I needed to keep her safe.
- Safe?

You turned her into a fucking monster.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.882
You brought every bodega snack
you could carry for Zoe.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.219
We played Uno with her for hours
until the lights came back on.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.388
And I thought...

14:50.223 --> 14:52.434
...you were one of my closest friends.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.312
I mean, hell, you're dating a Supe.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.273
If anyone would understand,
it'd be you, right?

14:58.273 --> 14:59.441
Why didn't you tell me?

15:00.650 --> 15:01.568

15:01.568 --> 15:03.236
Scared you'd have to pop my head.

I was scared to lose you.

I always cared about you, Hughie.

Shut the fuck up, Butcher.

Grace.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.851
- Not you.
- Oh, come off it.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.520
I washed my bollocks and all.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.188
- M?
- There are people who,

17:02.188 --> 17:04.524
because of ignorance or maybe insanity,

something to contribute.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.028
I'm not one of them.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.865
I'll get the kid back, Grace.

I'll make it right.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.369

Two agents from my detail are dead
at the hands of a 12-year-old.

17:23.543 --> 17:28.214
We had to tell their families they snorted
fentanyl-laced cocaine at the after-party.

17:28.214 --> 17:32.260
- Sir, our intel told us
the acid would work on Neuman.
- She's no idiot.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.970
She'll know I was behind it.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.682
Goddamn it! Everyone told me
to pick Buttigieg instead.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.476
You didn't know, sir. Marvin,

17:39.476 --> 17:41.936
I vouched for you.
The CIA is bankrolling you.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.521
All due respect, ma'am,

17:43.521 --> 17:45.774
you can always put Butcher back in charge.
He's right outside.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.817
What about Starlight?

17:47.817 --> 17:49.194
She goes by Annie now.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.780
Can Annie burn out Neuman's
fucking eyes, debilitate her?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.866
If she can get close enough to her without
getting her head popped off, who knows?

17:54.866 --> 17:58.870
But we might have to accept the
possibility that Neuman's... invulnerable.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.581
Congress certifies the election January 6.

18:01.581 --> 18:05.752

from the presidency.

Now, I can only keep my distance
from her for so long.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.388
[exhales]

37:44.388 --> 37:47.432
Well... Greece,

37:47.432 --> 37:52.562
all democracies, they fail
because people are fucking stupid.

37:52.562 --> 37:57.693
You don't need an army of Supermen
like Nazi bae wanted-- so German.

38:00.737 --> 38:04.449
If you crush the masses,
who builds your monuments?

38:04.449 --> 38:05.701
Who tongues your taint?

38:05.701 --> 38:07.494
No.

38:07.494 --> 38:11.206
The people will tear it apart themselves,

38:11.206 --> 38:13.500
just got to nudge 'em a little.

38:13.500 --> 38:17.295
Then you get to swoop in,
be the one saving it.

38:19.172 --> 38:22.467
Like Caesar.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.761
Statistically, it's inevitable.

38:36.732 --> 38:39.359
- I'd like you to join the Seven.
- No fucking way.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.319
- Why not?
- Because I'm not wearing

38:41.319 --> 38:45.449
some vaguely racist super suit
in front of a bunch of clapping seals.

38:45.449 --> 38:49.286
Plus, I'm a Black woman who is
a thousand times smarter than you.

38:49.286 --> 38:51.204
Your ego can't handle it.

38:51.204 --> 38:54.458
- I'm pretty smart myself.
- See what I mean?

38:54.458 --> 38:56.168
Smart enough to listen.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.213
I mean really listen to you.

39:01.298 --> 39:03.050
[sighs] You can stay here,

39:03.050 --> 39:06.845
reeking of Taco Bell and loneliness,

39:06.845 --> 39:10.807
or we can put some of your theories
into practice on a global scale.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.062
When's the last time
you got a chance like that?

39:16.146 --> 39:18.023
[sighs softly]

39:24.237 --> 39:25.655
Butcher, what are you doing here?

39:25.655 --> 39:27.240
Couldn't sleep.

39:30.577 --> 39:31.995
What about you?

39:31.995 --> 39:35.373
Um, my dad, he, uh, he had a stroke.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.458
Oh, fuck.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.001
I'm sorry to hear that, mate.

39:38.001 --> 39:41.296
Just gonna grab a few things
before I get back to him.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.965
- Is he, uh...
- I-I don't know.

39:46.927 --> 39:53.350
He-he called me right before it happened,
and, um... I didn't pick up.

39:55.352 --> 39:56.520
Why didn't I pick up?

39:56.520 --> 39:58.063
I mean, maybe I could've seen it coming.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.606
- I could-- I could've...
- No, no, no. Hughie.

39:59.606 --> 40:02.567
Don't beat yourself up about it.
There's nothing you could've done.

40:02.567 --> 40:06.446
All he ever wants is to chat about some
stupid fucking James Patterson book

40:06.446 --> 40:08.532
that he's reading,
and I couldn't even give him that.

40:08.532 --> 40:11.743
And now they're saying
that even if he lives...

40:13.662 --> 40:15.413
God.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.998
Yeah, well, I know what I'd want.

40:16.998 --> 40:20.085
Quick lights out.
Better than the alternative.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.505
Sitting there, stewing in your mistakes...

40:25.006 --> 40:26.633
...as you wait out the inevitable.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.260
[zipper closes]

40:45.652 --> 40:47.821
I hope your old man pulls through.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.950
Thank you. I-- Oh.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.038
- [Annie] Hughie?
- Hey.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.332
[sighs] I'm so sorry.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.710
I got here as soon as I could.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.545
I'm sorry.

41:03.545 --> 41:05.755
[sighs] I'm okay.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.107
[newscaster speaking over radio]

41:24.107 --> 41:25.400
[Frenchie] Turn here.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.401
- Right here?
- Yes.

41:26.401 --> 41:30.405
So, what does the CIA think of you
wasting their vast resources,

41:30.405 --> 41:32.532
all to hunt down the phone of Todd?

41:32.532 --> 41:34.159
I didn't ask.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.286
Just like I didn't ask you
to come, either.

41:36.286 --> 41:40.123
- Mm. We are here for you always, <i>mon ami.</i>
- [phone chimes]

41:49.090 --> 41:49.841
Colin?

41:50.675 --> 41:53.762
Why do you ask?

41:53.762 --> 41:55.722
You've been spending a lot of time...

41:55.722 --> 41:58.058
...together in the bathroom...

41:58.850 --> 42:02.520
Sorry, I should've said something.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.982
But it's complicated.

42:08.568 --> 42:11.947
To be clear

42:11.947 --> 42:14.491
I love you.

42:14.491 --> 42:15.784
<i>Moi aussi.</i>

42:16.117 --> 42:18.453
But you and I...

42:18.453 --> 42:20.413
Are not happening.

42:20.413 --> 42:21.790
I know.

42:22.207 --> 42:25.585
So if Colin makes you happy...

42:26.378 --> 42:28.797
Go be happy.

42:29.839 --> 42:33.093
Yo, white boy spotted.

42:33.093 --> 42:35.929
[pulsing music playing]

42:47.607 --> 42:49.234
[Todd] How's it going, Nick?
Here for the meet-up?

42:49.234 --> 42:50.694
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

42:50.694 --> 42:51.778
[Todd] Cool.

42:58.326 --> 42:59.536
[Frenchie] That's a good question.

42:59.536 --> 43:01.329
- What's that?
- [Frenchie] She wonders, uh...

43:01.329 --> 43:04.249
how a man such as this
win the love of a woman

43:04.249 --> 43:05.458
like Monique, you know?

43:05.458 --> 43:07.085
[Mother's Milk] Oh, he's, uh,
he's nice to my daughter.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.586
[Frenchie] Come on,
there is only one reason.

43:08.586 --> 43:12.132
Todd must be packing
some serious heat between his legs.

43:12.132 --> 43:14.926
Seriously, Frenchie,
you did not have to come.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.011
[Frenchie] Okay, I'm only saying,

43:16.011 --> 43:20.390
the man has some serious
Pete Davidson energy over there, no?

43:23.351 --> 43:24.602
[camera clicking]

43:25.687 --> 43:28.106
- You recognize her?
- Not sure.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.942
Hi, fellas. Thanks for making it
on such short notice.

43:30.942 --> 43:34.195
He's here, right?
Like, in the building here?

43:35.864 --> 43:37.699
This is the best day of my life.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.368
Yeah.

43:40.368 --> 43:42.704
[camera clicking]

43:44.289 --> 43:47.500
Well, you know, Dirk, I'm not actually
holding my breath underwater.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.419
I'm technically breathing underwater.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.338
So it's more impressive.

43:51.338 --> 43:53.631
Mmm. A-Train, try these
buffalo ranch bacon blasters.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.716
They're juicy.

43:54.716 --> 43:56.676
Sage.

43:56.676 --> 43:58.261
It's good to see you again.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.971
[quietly] What the fuck
are you doing here?

43:59.971 --> 44:03.183
Homelander's tired of being
surrounded by morons.

44:04.476 --> 44:07.103
- Hello, everyone.
- [Todd] Homelander!

44:07.103 --> 44:10.023
I just want to say, it's a huge honor
to be here with you.

44:10.023 --> 44:11.649
Right. Now, I can't stay long,

44:11.649 --> 44:15.362
but I heard that you are
some of my biggest fans,

44:15.362 --> 44:17.822
supporting me
when others turned their backs.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.783
I just wanted to personally say...

44:19.783 --> 44:25.622
thank you for your devotion
and your sacrifice.

44:27.123 --> 44:31.586
W-- Well, really, it's you
who gives so much to--

44:31.586 --> 44:33.797
You people are more than just fans.

44:33.797 --> 44:37.717
You're martyrs
to the greatest cause on Earth.

44:37.717 --> 44:39.969
- Open it.
- You got it.

44:42.764 --> 44:44.808
Whoa. Bats.

44:44.808 --> 44:46.142
Yeah.

44:47.477 --> 44:51.564
I want you to take these bats

44:51.564 --> 44:53.024
and beat these gentlemen to death.

45:00.365 --> 45:04.869
[laughing] You're funny.

45:04.869 --> 45:09.040
[laughs] Oh, it's like one of your tests.
You want us to say no.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.375
No, Deep.

45:10.375 --> 45:13.086
This is not a test.

45:13.962 --> 45:20.927
I want you to beat
these gentlemen to death... now.

45:25.723 --> 45:28.017
I think maybe we should go.

45:29.727 --> 45:30.728
Oh, Jesus!

45:31.813 --> 45:32.814
Mm-hmm.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.150
Oh, shit.

45:40.530 --> 45:41.531
Jesus!

45:41.531 --> 45:43.366
[intense music playing]

45:52.250 --> 45:54.043
Stay here.

45:54.043 --> 45:56.421
Wait for further instructions.

46:07.056 --> 46:10.643
Yo, what the fuck?
That was so fucked-up, you guys.

46:12.562 --> 46:15.190
[Mother's Milk] What the fuck
is he doing here?

46:17.692 --> 46:20.862
[Frenchie] He should be at his trial, no?

46:20.862 --> 46:22.155
Shit.

until we almost merge into one.

52:34.151 --> 52:37.989
So, you tell me, son.
Whatever it is, it's-it's okay.

52:39.323 --> 52:42.451
I don't want Butcher to die.

52:49.959 --> 52:53.129
But even after he abandoned you like that?

52:53.129 --> 52:55.548
[sighs] That was brutal.

52:55.548 --> 52:57.258
And all those things he said about you.

52:57.258 --> 53:00.428
He said awful, awful things about you.

53:00.428 --> 53:02.305
Just horrible.

53:04.390 --> 53:06.309
My mom loved him.

[sighs] Noir was right,
that was so fucked-up.

53:42.303 --> 53:44.680
[woman's voice] You have every right
to be upset.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.766
I'm upset for you.

53:46.766 --> 53:49.226
What if we just left?

53:51.228 --> 53:53.773
We could vanish under the waves forever.

53:55.024 --> 53:57.652
Everyone there loves you for you.

53:57.652 --> 54:02.114
As the sweet, sensitive,
really strong swimmer you are.

54:02.114 --> 54:03.574
[sniffles]

54:03.574 --> 54:07.244
Look at me.

54:07.244 --> 54:09.622
Baby, look at me.

54:11.248 --> 54:14.293
We wouldn't have to hide our love anymore.

54:14.293 --> 54:18.297
We could just be Kevin and Ambrosius.

You get better, okay?

You get better, and I will
talk to you for hours about <i>Deadly Cross.</i>

56:11.494 --> 56:14.246
You can read the whole

I really hope you can hear me.

You promised me
you would take care of Ryan.

I'm trying to do here?

I think you're
about to fuck over Hughie, again.

57:00.334 --> 57:02.711
And it's going to blow up
in your face, again.

57:02.711 --> 57:06.423
I saved the kid, at the Tower, didn't I?

57:06.423 --> 57:09.927
I had a clean shot at Homelander,
game, set and fucking match,

57:09.927 --> 57:11.762
but I chose to save him.

57:13.514 --> 57:15.516
And look where it got us.

57:16.892 --> 57:19.061
You promised me.

57:20.563 --> 57:25.067
If Ryan becomes like Homelander,
that's the end of the world.

57:28.237 --> 57:29.989
Don't you think I know that?

57:29.989 --> 57:32.241
You have to find a better way.

57:35.286 --> 57:37.121
What the hell do you want from me, Becca?

57:43.043 --> 57:45.421
Be the man that I married.

57:52.720 --> 57:55.264
That man died a long time ago.

57:56.265 --> 57:58.434
It's too late.
