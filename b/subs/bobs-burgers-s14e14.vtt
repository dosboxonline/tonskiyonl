00:20.913 --> 00:23.930
[Linda] Look at us, going
to a birthday party as a family.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.099
Nothing cooler than partying
with your parents.

00:26.176 --> 00:28.527
Damn straight. See?
They even let us say damn.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.103
Uh-huh. Don't say damn.

00:30.256 --> 00:31.530
So, I sort of see how me,

00:31.681 --> 00:33.848
Gene and Tina got invited
to Rudy's Dad's

00:33.868 --> 00:35.759
birthday party,
'cause we're Rudy's friends,

00:35.761 --> 00:38.111
but, uh, Mom and Dad,
what's going on there?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.280
Well, we saw him at the
parent-teacher conference thing

00:40.432 --> 00:41.707
-and--
-He guilt invited us.

00:41.858 --> 00:43.625
-We were guilt invited.
-Yeah.

00:45.604 --> 00:47.621
Oh, sorry to be
"on his phone" guy.

00:47.697 --> 00:49.048
Just shooting off a quick email.

00:49.241 --> 00:51.199
Ooh, email. Who are ya emailing?

00:51.218 --> 00:52.609
Oh. A bowling alley.

00:52.702 --> 00:55.203
-That's fun.
-Yeah. Just planning
a bowling party.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.722
Uh, R-Rudy's party?

00:56.873 --> 01:00.133
No. Mine. It's a little thing
I do for my birthday every year.

01:00.286 --> 01:01.618
Aw, I love bowling.

01:01.637 --> 01:04.229
Oh. Uh, do you want to...

01:04.381 --> 01:06.565
-come to the party?
-Oh, you-you don't have to...

01:06.734 --> 01:08.233
-No.
-Yeah! Yes.

01:08.385 --> 01:10.310
Well, I just hope
Rudy has a good time.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.479
He's up to his butt
in divorced parent dating drama

01:12.631 --> 01:14.631
and he deserves
to have fun tonight.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.300
By the way, have we made
you guys sign paperwork

01:16.393 --> 01:17.892
saying you won't get divorced?

01:17.970 --> 01:19.636
No? I'll have Ken draw it up.

01:19.655 --> 01:20.987
He did my estate papers.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.322
Eh, I like our odds.

01:22.474 --> 01:23.807
I love your dad as much as I did

01:23.826 --> 01:25.417
the first time
I told him I loved him.

01:25.569 --> 01:26.660
Remember that, Bob?

01:26.754 --> 01:28.478
You remember when I first said
I love you?

01:28.497 --> 01:31.090
-Y-Y-Yes.
-Remember where we were?

01:31.241 --> 01:32.907
-I do.
-Huh?

01:33.076 --> 01:35.335
Where, w-where
were you guys, Dad?

01:35.487 --> 01:36.744
Um...

01:36.764 --> 01:38.839
Maybe he remembers,
but he's getting

01:39.007 --> 01:40.432
choked up thinking about it?

01:40.659 --> 01:42.101
We were, um...

01:42.328 --> 01:44.328
-uh...
-No, he forgot.

01:44.346 --> 01:45.846
Oh, it's okay you forgot.

01:45.998 --> 01:47.347
Your brain is just
full of burger toppings.

01:47.499 --> 01:49.015
Uh, I'm-I'm gonna remember.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.592
It's... um...

01:50.719 --> 01:52.502
Do you remember when I farted

01:52.521 --> 01:55.280
and it sounded like
someone saying, "Wazzup"?

01:55.432 --> 01:57.098
-Yes.
-So you can remember that?

01:57.118 --> 01:59.025
Well, that was right
when we got in the car.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.677
-Yeah.
-Yeah, so that's more recent.

02:00.696 --> 02:02.512
[Gene] Just wanted to make
sure everyone caught that.

02:02.606 --> 02:04.623
-Pretty special.
-[Bob] Certainly was.

02:05.701 --> 02:07.609
[Bob]
Oh, was it... outdoors?

02:07.628 --> 02:10.036
The place where you first said
"I love you," or indoors?

02:10.189 --> 02:11.296
[Linda]
Bob, don't worry about it.

02:11.448 --> 02:13.039
-Hey, Rudy.
-Uh, hey, guys.

02:13.192 --> 02:14.616
Thanks for coming.
It was surprisingly hard

02:14.635 --> 02:17.285
to get kids our age excited
about a 44-year-old man's

02:17.363 --> 02:18.637
-birthday party.
-I don't know why.

02:18.864 --> 02:21.715
We love people talking
about podcasts and back pain.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.291
You guys want
to get some slushees?

02:23.310 --> 02:24.626
It's all-you-can-drink slushees.

02:24.794 --> 02:25.886
My dad's treat.

02:26.038 --> 02:27.512
-Whoa.
-Nice.
-All I can drink?

02:27.665 --> 02:29.706
'Cause that's probably different
from all you can drink.

02:29.725 --> 02:32.300
Oh, I'm getting a brain freeze
just thinking about it.

02:32.394 --> 02:33.652
Mom, Dad, smell you later, bye.

02:33.803 --> 02:35.487
Smell y-- Yeah. Yeah.

02:35.639 --> 02:37.047
[all slurping]

02:37.065 --> 02:39.383
Ah, who doesn't love
a free slushee?

02:39.551 --> 02:40.550
Maybe that lady?

02:40.644 --> 02:41.976
[groans]

02:41.996 --> 02:43.478
[Gene]
If it was socially acceptable

02:43.497 --> 02:45.313
to lick that off the floor,
I would.

02:45.407 --> 02:47.482
-It isn't, is it?
-Uh, Rudy?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.408
Everything okay?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.502
You're looking very un-slushee.

02:50.654 --> 02:51.670
Yeah, sorry.

02:51.897 --> 02:53.172
It's my mom's boyfriend, Paul.

02:53.323 --> 02:54.247
Look at him.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.008
Smiling.
Listening to people talk.

02:56.235 --> 02:57.492
Making eye contact.

02:57.569 --> 02:58.568
What's up with that?

02:58.662 --> 03:00.070
[groaning]
Hate that.

03:00.088 --> 03:02.406
[Rudy] I'm just worried
about my dad. He's fragile.

03:02.424 --> 03:04.758
Especially since
he and Vicky broke up.

03:04.852 --> 03:05.684
Oh, no. Who broke up with who?

03:05.835 --> 03:07.019
Well, it was pretty mutual.

03:07.170 --> 03:09.579
He sent her a text saying,
"We need to talk."

03:09.673 --> 03:11.431
And she wrote back "Break up,"
question mark.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.433
Then she gave her
own text a thumbs-up

03:13.527 --> 03:14.918
-and, you know, that was that.
-Damn.

03:14.937 --> 03:17.254
So what I'm hearing is
your dad's a free man again.

03:17.272 --> 03:18.438
He's back on the market.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.607
Yeah. He's selling
"hot dad" by the pound.

03:20.759 --> 03:23.702
It's just Dad's
like a delicate caterpillar.

03:23.853 --> 03:26.112
Waiting to become a big,
strong beautiful butterfly.

03:26.265 --> 03:27.447
But that's not gonna happen

03:27.599 --> 03:28.949
if Mr. Nice-All-The-Time Paul
comes over

03:29.101 --> 03:30.600
and steps on Dad's
sweet little cocoon.

03:30.694 --> 03:33.787
And how is Paul stepping
on your dad's cocoon?

03:33.939 --> 03:35.605
Seriously, Tina?
Look at him!

03:35.624 --> 03:36.882
I just-- It--

03:37.033 --> 03:39.218
It doesn't feel good.
It's-it's just not good!

03:39.369 --> 03:41.202
Rudy, Rudy, just breathe.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.721
-I'm bad at that!
-Oh, right.

03:42.872 --> 03:45.949
I just want tonight to be
the bowling party of his dreams

03:46.042 --> 03:48.134
and the perfect 44th birthday.

03:48.287 --> 03:49.636
-Okay. Done.
-What?

03:49.805 --> 03:51.121
Done. It shall be so.

03:51.139 --> 03:52.547
Just leave it to me and Gene

03:52.641 --> 03:53.899
and also Tina.

03:54.050 --> 03:55.883
-Okay.
-Another round, please, sir.

03:55.961 --> 03:58.144
And don't skimp
on the cheer-up syrup.

03:58.297 --> 04:01.406
Men's size 11 and a ladies'
size 9 and a half.

04:01.558 --> 04:03.558
Wow, these are cute.
Look at these, Bob.

04:03.635 --> 04:05.911
I mean, they're bowling shoes,
but sure?

04:06.138 --> 04:07.913
I would wear these, like,
in the world.

04:08.064 --> 04:10.307
-Really?
-It's hard to find cute shoes.

04:10.325 --> 04:11.566
-You know.
-Oh, I do know.

04:11.660 --> 04:14.327
-Oh, hey. You guys made it.
-Yeah, hi.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.495
Happy birthday!

04:15.589 --> 04:17.981
-Great shoes. Aren't they nice?
-Uh, yes.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.092
We were just waiting
for our lane assignment.

04:20.243 --> 04:22.152
I-I guess it's pretty busy.

04:22.212 --> 04:23.911
Oh. Uh, do you want to bowl

04:23.931 --> 04:26.673
-in our lane?
-No, I wasn't--
I was not saying that at all.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.249
Sure! Right, Bob?

04:28.269 --> 04:29.917
-Uh, yeah.
-Yeah!

04:30.012 --> 04:31.436
Okay.
I'll-I'll just tell the guy

04:31.588 --> 04:33.497
at the counter
to, uh, add you. Heh.

04:33.665 --> 04:34.922
Yay, fun!

04:34.942 --> 04:36.666
Oh, my God, we did it again.

04:36.685 --> 04:38.018
Oh, I love these shoes.

04:38.170 --> 04:39.519
Pu-- I'm putting them on.

04:39.671 --> 04:41.095
Ooh, they've got my size
right on the back.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.447
That's fun.

04:42.599 --> 04:43.615
So our job tonight is

04:43.767 --> 04:44.932
to make your dad look good.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.785
Set him up for success,
help him shine.

04:46.936 --> 04:48.620
And if Paul looks
like a pathetic dork

04:48.772 --> 04:49.937
by comparison, that's fine, too.

04:50.032 --> 04:52.015
So what are your dad's
strengths?

04:52.108 --> 04:53.608
Well, the man knows
how to rock a pant pleat.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.128
I've noticed. You could cut
a finger on those bad boys.

04:56.355 --> 04:57.629
He's also a pretty good bowler.

04:57.856 --> 04:59.706
They don't call him
"Spare-ta-cus" for nothing.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.115
And by "they," I mean "me."

05:01.135 --> 05:02.801
Great, okay, well,
we can work with that.

05:02.952 --> 05:04.619
[Rudy]
But Paul is Paul.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.288
He's probably great at bowling.
He's good at everything.

05:07.382 --> 05:08.974
I once saw a valet
throw him his keys

05:09.051 --> 05:11.310
from, like, six feet away
and Paul caught it

05:11.495 --> 05:12.886
-like it was nothing.
-[Tina] Whoa.

05:13.038 --> 05:15.480
-[Rudy] Right?
-I mean, Paul doesn't seem
that athletic

05:15.632 --> 05:17.874
and naturally strong,
but also gentle.

05:17.967 --> 05:19.876
I don't feel
like giving him a trophy

05:19.895 --> 05:21.486
just for the cool way
he's standing.

05:21.713 --> 05:23.730
[groans] I just wish my dad
was still with Vicky.

05:23.882 --> 05:26.140
She was, you know,
whatever the opposite of fun is,

05:26.160 --> 05:28.568
but at least he wouldn't be
single while mom was

05:28.720 --> 05:30.144
hugging it up
with Paul over there.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.312
Okay, all right, all right.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.831
Listen. We've got
the bowling thing.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.108
We've got the dating thing.
Maybe we...

05:35.260 --> 05:37.410
just get him a girlfriend
that's good at bowling?

05:37.563 --> 05:39.171
You can get a girlfriend
in one night, right?

05:39.398 --> 05:41.155
-Uh...
-Rudy, any prospects here

05:41.233 --> 05:42.341
right now, by any chance?

05:42.568 --> 05:45.159
I mean, there's that lady
over there, Cherie,

05:45.179 --> 05:47.587
from his Indian cooking class.
They're both allergic to cumin.

05:47.739 --> 05:49.756
And I guess they really bonded
over how dumb it is

05:49.833 --> 05:52.092
for people with a cumin allergy
to take that class.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.168
-Aw.
-Also I wish
I could have plucked

05:54.262 --> 05:55.745
my dad's one crazy eyebrow hair.

05:55.747 --> 05:57.689
I mean, it really
would've helped his chances.

05:57.841 --> 05:59.416
Oh, yeah.
I can see it from here.

05:59.434 --> 06:00.600
Yeah, it's a beast.

06:00.752 --> 06:03.028
Is it possible
it's moving around on its own?

06:03.255 --> 06:04.512
Rudy, come on, our lane's ready.

06:04.590 --> 06:07.181
Oh, and kids, your parents
are bowling with us.

06:07.275 --> 06:10.035
Lucky you. Heh. Seriously,
though, they're a fun couple.

06:10.186 --> 06:12.537
Uh, them, plus your mom
and Paul, that makes six.

06:12.764 --> 06:15.189
Did you say Mom and Paul?

06:15.283 --> 06:16.541
Uh, yeah. There they are. Hey!

06:16.768 --> 06:19.193
-Hey.
-See ya soon,
bowling buddies. Heh.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.787
Oh, boy. That's it.

06:20.939 --> 06:24.049
Dad and Good-At-Everything Paul
are bowling against each other.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.550
Paul will crush him.

06:25.702 --> 06:26.776
Worst-case scenario.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.612
Dad's cocoon getting stomped.

06:28.705 --> 06:31.223
-Caterpillar guts everywhere.
-No, no, no.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.799
Okay, all right, Rud-- listen.

06:32.951 --> 06:34.393
We're not gonna
let Paul humiliate

06:34.620 --> 06:36.803
your father on his birthday,
okay? I promise.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.064
I swear it
by my reusable slushee cup.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.049
-[Gene gasps]
-Yeah, you heard me. [slurps]

06:42.069 --> 06:43.627
Oh, ow, brain freeze.

06:43.645 --> 06:45.404
-Uh, got to slow down.
-Here, let-let me rub your head.

06:45.597 --> 06:47.388
-Thank you. It still hurts.
-There you go.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.724
-I know, let me really rub it.
-[Louise shouts]

06:49.743 --> 06:52.226
-Hey! Ow!
-[Rudy grunting]

06:52.320 --> 06:54.246
Rudy!

06:58.919 --> 07:00.067
Oh, God, it's all happening.

07:00.162 --> 07:01.086
Hold it together, Rudes.

07:01.163 --> 07:02.236
We're gonna handle this.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.422
I know you're saying words,

07:03.649 --> 07:05.315
but all I can hear
is my Dad's cocoon

07:05.408 --> 07:07.317
crunch, crunch, crunching
under Paul's feet.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.593
That's Gene
eating tortilla chips.

07:08.820 --> 07:09.819
Sorry.

07:09.913 --> 07:12.172
There he is.
Oh, good ball choice, son.

07:12.324 --> 07:14.766
Heh. Thanks. Yeah,
I coordinated it with my shirt.

07:14.918 --> 07:16.417
-Well, I noticed.
-Hey, kids.

07:16.586 --> 07:18.270
Kids, meet shoes.
Shoes, meet kids.

07:18.497 --> 07:19.512
-Oh, hi.
-Mm.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.940
-Hey, there they are.
-And here we are.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.000
Are you ready to roll?

07:24.019 --> 07:25.502
'Cause it's bowling.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.611
-Oh!
-Oh, yes!

07:26.763 --> 07:28.780
-I love it.
-Balls are round, so they roll.

07:28.932 --> 07:30.097
Yeah.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.767
Oh, man. Lame,
but somehow charming puns?

07:32.861 --> 07:34.435
That's my dad's territory.

07:34.529 --> 07:36.288
You know what, I'm gonna
pop over to the men's room.

07:36.364 --> 07:39.516
I've got a birthday bladder,
aka too many fizzy waters.

07:39.609 --> 07:40.684
Don't start without me.

07:40.852 --> 07:42.610
Okay, let's move.
I'm gonna go stall Paul

07:42.629 --> 07:45.130
so he can't bowl,
and I'll just keep that going

07:45.281 --> 07:46.706
-until the party's over?
-[both] Mm-hmm.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.024
-Tina?
-Yeah?

07:48.026 --> 07:49.116
Go to the cumin lady

07:49.211 --> 07:50.785
from Indian cooking class.
Make it happen.

07:50.862 --> 07:53.046
It would be nice if Sylvester
had a new girlfriend

07:53.198 --> 07:54.622
in, like, 20 minutes?

07:54.716 --> 07:55.882
-Uh...
-Perfect.

07:56.034 --> 07:57.717
-Gene?
-Slushee duty, got it.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.293
-No. Go with Rudy.
-Aw.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.595
Follow Sylvester to the bathroom

08:00.706 --> 08:02.964
and pluck those eyebrows
with extreme prejudice.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.207
-On it.
-Wait.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.542
Rudy, what's Paul's deal again?

08:05.560 --> 08:06.710
What's-what's he do?

08:06.728 --> 08:08.211
He's an occupational therapist.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.896
If people have pain
that makes it difficult

08:10.065 --> 08:12.324
to do things, he helps them
with exercises or advice.

08:12.551 --> 08:14.976
-As if we couldn't
hate him any more.
-I know.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.886
Okay, everybody break.
Go! Go! Okay.

08:16.905 --> 08:18.830
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay, okay, okay, okay.

08:19.057 --> 08:20.406
-Dad. Hey, Dad? Dad.
-Yeah? What, what, what?

08:20.559 --> 08:21.315
Yeah. What is it?

08:21.409 --> 08:23.076
I just learned that Paul here

08:23.152 --> 08:25.152
is an occupational therapist.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.730
Uh, yeah. Yes, I am.

08:26.748 --> 08:28.565
My dad needs that. Lots of it.

08:28.583 --> 08:31.325
-Oh!
Are certain motions painful?
-I do?

08:31.419 --> 08:32.844
I mean, yeah.

08:32.996 --> 08:35.238
-Which ones?
-Um, all of them?

08:35.331 --> 08:37.015
-See what I mean?
-Oh.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.575
-Hi.
-Uh... hi.

08:38.593 --> 08:40.577
Having some popcorn?

08:40.595 --> 08:42.262
Cool. Cool, cool.

08:42.414 --> 08:44.171
[sighs] Birthdays, am I right?

08:44.266 --> 08:45.715
Stand up, let me, let me look.

08:45.717 --> 08:46.750
Sure. [grunts]

08:46.768 --> 08:47.692
Little sound there.

08:47.919 --> 08:48.935
Uh... [stammers] Wait.

08:49.087 --> 08:50.845
Do you not make sounds
when you stand up?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.589
Uh, l-let's see you
touch your toes.

08:52.607 --> 08:54.257
Touch, like... "touch"?

08:54.350 --> 08:56.109
-Give it a shot.
-Oh, my God.

08:56.261 --> 08:58.036
[whistles] Yeah. [whistles]

08:58.263 --> 08:59.946
You... you whistled twice.

09:00.098 --> 09:01.114
Is-is that bad?

09:01.266 --> 09:02.207
Yeah, it's a two-whistler.

09:02.358 --> 09:03.708
-Yep.
-Oh, God.

09:03.860 --> 09:05.210
-Ow, ow, ow, ow!
-It's worth it, Dad.

09:05.361 --> 09:06.786
I'm sorry. I love you!

09:06.938 --> 09:08.104
The hair is fighting back!

09:08.123 --> 09:09.606
It wants to live!

09:09.699 --> 09:10.882
We're gonna kill it!

09:11.034 --> 09:12.551
Don't let it into your mind!

09:12.778 --> 09:14.277
Ow, kids, ow!

09:14.370 --> 09:15.703
It knows what you're afraid of!

09:15.797 --> 09:17.947
I mean, it seems like
you guys have great chemistry.

09:17.966 --> 09:19.616
He's learning
to cook Indian food,

09:19.618 --> 09:21.301
you're learning
to cook Indian food.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.119
Maybe it's time to take it
to the next level

09:23.212 --> 09:24.563
and move in together?

09:24.714 --> 09:26.139
I'm sorry, who are you?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.791
So your right shoulder is

09:27.884 --> 09:29.309
about two inches higher
than your left.

09:29.461 --> 09:31.978
-It is?
-Yes. That's even.

09:32.130 --> 09:34.147
-Oh! [grunting]
-Does that hurt?

09:34.299 --> 09:35.465
It's not supposed to.

09:35.483 --> 09:37.317
I mean, is-- so this is normal?

09:37.469 --> 09:39.578
-Th-This is how standing is?
-I'm afraid so.

09:39.729 --> 09:41.471
Okay, let's bowl.

09:41.564 --> 09:43.064
I am very ready.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.082
Yeah. Here.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.141
I'll give you my card.

09:45.234 --> 09:46.159
No, no, no, don't bowl.

09:46.311 --> 09:47.735
He needs help now.

09:47.829 --> 09:48.978
He's got so many problems.

09:48.997 --> 09:50.755
I can't believe
he's survived this long.

09:50.832 --> 09:54.259
It's okay, Louise.
Uh, I'll be fine. I-I-I think.

09:54.486 --> 09:55.910
[sighs] Crap.

09:56.004 --> 09:58.154
Here we go, my dad's up first.

09:58.323 --> 10:00.432
Go me! It's my birthday.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.583
And I'm bowling.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.344
-[all groaning]
-Oof.

10:04.496 --> 10:05.753
Hey, it's just his first roll.

10:05.772 --> 10:06.830
Tina, how'd it go?

10:06.998 --> 10:08.998
-Cherie wants to move slow.
-[groans]

10:09.017 --> 10:11.109
I guess she thinks asking
Sylvester to be her boyfriend

10:11.260 --> 10:14.337
after they've gone on no dates
is, quote, "very confusing."

10:14.339 --> 10:16.097
-Ridiculous.
-Oh, God.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.450
Well, hey, three pins
are better than nothing.

10:18.619 --> 10:19.618
Yeah.

10:19.845 --> 10:22.011
The intimidation factor's
already there.

10:22.030 --> 10:24.180
Paul's gonna bowl
the pants off my dad

10:24.199 --> 10:25.606
at his own birthday party.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.958
Beautifully pleated pants?

10:27.110 --> 10:29.294
And those eyebrows are bringing
the razzle dazzle.

10:29.521 --> 10:31.204
I-I can't watch. Maybe I'll bail

10:31.356 --> 10:33.706
-and go drown
my sorrows in slushee.
-I'm in!

10:33.859 --> 10:36.134
-I could slush. Louise?
-Uh...

10:37.120 --> 10:38.803
Huh. What if we...?

10:39.030 --> 10:40.955
Guys, come with me.
I have an idea.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.123
Come with you where?

10:42.217 --> 10:43.308
Anywhere but here is good.

10:43.459 --> 10:45.051
-Uh, hey, bud.
-Your turn.

10:45.203 --> 10:47.387
Um, go on without me--
we're doing kid stuff.

10:47.539 --> 10:49.296
Not that I'm not
totally comfortable

10:49.391 --> 10:50.482
with everything going on here

10:50.709 --> 10:53.042
in this area
of the bowling alley, so...

10:53.136 --> 10:54.210
Um, okay, bye.

10:54.971 --> 10:57.397
-What are we doing?
-Also a question
I was going to ask.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.066
We're doing what it takes to
give your dad an amazing night.

11:00.218 --> 11:02.235
Are we getting him a gift
from what I think is

11:02.329 --> 11:04.053
an extension cord museum?

11:04.072 --> 11:06.164
-[kids shout]
-You kids aren't allowed
back here.

11:06.315 --> 11:07.481
Right, right. Uh, so sorry

11:07.501 --> 11:09.483
for whatever this is
we're doing.

11:09.652 --> 11:11.744
I was thinking this didn't
look like a bathroom.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.155
-Okay. Get out now.
-Wait. Please.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.733
-What?
-[sighs] This is Rudy.
Rudy say hi.

11:16.751 --> 11:17.842
Uh, hello, I'm Rudy.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.326
And it's his dad's birthday,

11:19.346 --> 11:20.845
and his dad's about to bowl
against Paul,

11:20.997 --> 11:24.349
who's his mom's new boyfriend,
and Paul's good at everything.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.685
And he's-he's gonna
kick Rudy's dad's butt.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.912
And he's gonna look like...
like what were you saying?

11:28.930 --> 11:30.914
Like a dead caterpillar
or something?

11:30.932 --> 11:33.266
Yeah, he's gonna look like,
an-an unrealized butterfly.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.509
Yeah. So we just want to
help him win.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.344
You know, from back here,
somehow.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.923
I mean, it would be
a lot like cheating,

11:39.941 --> 11:41.591
but it would be for charity.

11:41.609 --> 11:43.109
So... yeah.

11:43.186 --> 11:45.870
It's fine,
we'll figure out something else.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.521
-I love it.
-Huh? What?

11:47.541 --> 11:50.767
I've got a Paul,
but my Paul is named Penny

11:50.860 --> 11:53.619
and she makes my dad very happy.

11:53.714 --> 11:54.879
How dare she.

11:55.106 --> 11:57.623
-Okay. We're cheating.
-We... are?

11:57.718 --> 12:00.443
-Yeah, Tina, we are.
-You're going down, Penny!

12:00.536 --> 12:01.461
-Uh, Paul.
-Uh-huh.

12:01.613 --> 12:02.762
-No, it's important.
-Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

12:06.801 --> 12:08.968
[Louise] Lane ten.
Rudy's dad and Paul are playing

12:09.120 --> 12:10.136
-on this lane right now.
-And last we saw,

12:10.230 --> 12:11.712
my dad was bowling like ass.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.306
Sorry. I said "ass."

12:13.458 --> 12:15.400
So we've got to make
this cheating stuff happen soon.

12:15.551 --> 12:18.127
Uh, I feel like
helping Sylvester by cheating

12:18.146 --> 12:19.295
is maybe not the best idea,

12:19.388 --> 12:20.888
and also just cheating
in general.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.649
Tina, Rudy is our friend,
and if our friend wants his dad

12:23.802 --> 12:26.077
to bowl an amazing game
and teach Paul a lesson

12:26.229 --> 12:27.804
he will never freaking forget,

12:27.897 --> 12:28.988
that's what we're gonna do.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.564
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Okay.

12:30.658 --> 12:32.008
So, how's this gonna work?

12:32.010 --> 12:33.734
-Sorry,
I didn't catch your name.
-No names.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.086
The less we know about
each other, the better.

12:35.313 --> 12:36.996
-It's on your name tag?
-Rachel.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.482
Crap. Okay, I have an idea
of how we can do this,

12:39.501 --> 12:42.001
but I haven't tried it before
and it's risky.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.595
When your dad's ball
hits the pins,

12:43.822 --> 12:45.930
there's just enough clearance
over the backstop

12:46.082 --> 12:48.082
for us to toss
an extra pin in there.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.842
And if we hit 'em just right,

12:49.995 --> 12:51.752
then it's nothing but strikes.

12:51.846 --> 12:54.330
-Fantastic.
-Ooh... Gutter ball.

12:54.349 --> 12:56.349
Ugh, please,
don't let it be Spare-ta-cus.

12:56.501 --> 12:58.610
Ugh. They look good,
but they don't actually

12:58.761 --> 12:59.944
help me bowl better.

13:00.171 --> 13:01.838
-You're lucky you're hot.
-You talking to me?

13:02.007 --> 13:03.172
-Yeah, you, too.
-I know.

13:03.191 --> 13:05.950
Okay. I need two kids,
one to grab the pin

13:06.177 --> 13:07.677
before it gets swept
into the pin elevator,

13:07.695 --> 13:10.363
and one to hold onto
the person grabbing the pin,

13:10.515 --> 13:11.772
so they don't fall
into the machine.

13:11.866 --> 13:13.182
Sounds... dangerous?

13:13.201 --> 13:15.034
Pin-setting used to be done
by child laborers,

13:15.186 --> 13:17.444
so I'm sure that means
it's perfectly safe.

13:17.539 --> 13:19.038
We can't see anything
from back here.

13:19.190 --> 13:20.965
How will we know
when it's Rudy's dad's turn?

13:21.192 --> 13:22.801
Good point.
We need eyes on the outside.

13:23.028 --> 13:24.618
-I'll do it.
-Gene, no offense,

13:24.638 --> 13:26.712
but if we send you out there,
we're gonna find you face-down

13:26.865 --> 13:29.048
-at the slushee bar.
-And your point is?

13:29.200 --> 13:32.126
Um, I'll go.
I would love to be not here.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.311
No.

13:33.462 --> 13:35.388
Your "I'm not doing
anything bad" face is--

13:35.482 --> 13:37.223
let's just say it--
really bad.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.150
Oh. What-what about: "Eh"?

13:39.302 --> 13:41.210
-[groans] I'll go.
-Be sneaky.

13:41.229 --> 13:43.470
Peek at the scoreboard,
memorize the bowling order,

13:43.565 --> 13:45.472
-and report back.
-A sneak and a peek.

13:45.567 --> 13:46.549
Got it.

13:46.642 --> 13:48.993
♪ ♪

13:50.831 --> 13:52.163
Oof.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.724
Sylvester's losing pretty bad,

13:54.726 --> 13:57.484
but we still have like half
a game left to turn it around.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.987
Whoa, and Mom and Dad are
not bringing it.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.674
-[Bob] Hey, Louise.
-Ugh. They spotted me.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.568
Uh, hey, Dad. Mom.
Rough game?

14:05.587 --> 14:07.403
I'm beginning to think
that as athletes

14:07.422 --> 14:09.088
you guys are kind of not elite.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.498
Yeah. We're bad at this. Oh!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.167
Did you say "I love you"
when we were

14:13.261 --> 14:14.686
at a sports game of some kind?

14:14.837 --> 14:17.763
No, but one time you threw up
on me at a baseball game.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.524
-Yeah, but lovingly.
-Yeah, kinda.

14:19.751 --> 14:20.859
Lot of peanuts.

14:21.086 --> 14:22.009
Check out Paul

14:22.028 --> 14:23.510
with the big blue ball.
[chuckles]

14:23.605 --> 14:26.030
Okay, so, Sylvester's up
after Paul.

14:26.107 --> 14:28.700
Hmm. You can totally see
Rachel's elbow right now.

14:28.927 --> 14:31.260
And I think Gene's knees
for some reason?

14:31.429 --> 14:32.929
[sighs] It's fine, it's fine.

14:32.931 --> 14:35.665
These lanes are so long,
and adults' eyesight is so bad.

14:37.102 --> 14:38.601
[Paul groans]

14:38.620 --> 14:39.769
Bananas. It's a split!

14:39.787 --> 14:41.212
Well, you're still
way ahead of me.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.655
There's a good chance
he's throwing the game

16:48.750 --> 16:51.658
because he's a nice guy
who's really good at bowling,

16:51.678 --> 16:54.253

his ex-wife's new boyfriend

16:54.330 --> 16:55.847
look bad, or something,

16:56.074 --> 16:57.998
and doing this plan
could ruin everything.

our hands would get mangled
