WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.919
[alarm blaring]

00:03.002 --> 00:04.254
Red, we have to go.

00:04.337 --> 00:05.588
Not without Marvin.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.674
Right now,
there's a half dozen cops in here.

00:07.757 --> 00:10.343
In the next five minutes,
the number's gonna triple.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.387
Then we better find him.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.805
[ominous music playing]

00:13.888 --> 00:15.557
[Cooper]<i> Dembe, any sign of Gerard?</i>

00:16.266 --> 00:17.350
[Dembe] I'm sorry, Harold.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.768
I think Marvin's gone.

00:18.852 --> 00:19.728
How'd he get out?

00:19.811 --> 00:21.688
Hang on, we may not know where he is,

00:21.771 --> 00:24.441
but I think we can figure out
where he is going.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.234
Check this out. According to records,

00:26.317 --> 00:30.071
three private jets were scheduled
to depart from that airport.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.406
What do we know about the three?

00:31.489 --> 00:32.782
[Aram] Two corporate jets,

00:32.866 --> 00:35.410
one for an insurance company,
one for a hedge fund,

00:35.493 --> 00:39.122
and both of those make regular trips
to and from Culpeper.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.751
But this one is owned by some kind
of shell holding company

00:42.834 --> 00:44.169
<i>based in the Philippines.</i>

00:44.252 --> 00:47.922
It was scheduled to land and depart
all within 30 minutes of Marvin's arrival.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.674
What's its scheduled destination?

00:49.758 --> 00:50.884
Aeródromo Rizal,

00:50.967 --> 00:54.429
an airfield about 40 minutes
outside Camagüey, Cuba.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.765
[Dembe]
<i>If that's Marvin's plane, it's here.</i>

00:56.848 --> 00:59.601
Nothing was cleared to take off
after the evacuation started.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.644
It's not because it never landed.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.939
That plane was on approach to Culpeper
when the security alert was called in.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.775
Air traffic control waved it off.

01:06.858 --> 01:07.817
It was diverted?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.737
To another private airfield
30 miles north.

01:10.820 --> 01:14.032
-That must be where Marvin's heading.
-I'm leaving now. Send me the location.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.160
Agent Ressler's still in the air.
I'll reach out to him.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.953
I don't know how it happened,

01:19.037 --> 01:22.332
but Fisker wasn't there
and Reddington was waiting.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.043
[exhales]
Well, find out where the hell he is.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.170
I'll be in Camagüey by morning.

01:27.670 --> 01:31.466
I need us to be in the air as soon
as possible. Just leave the bottle.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.178
-Mr. Gerard?
-Can we wait till we take off?

01:35.261 --> 01:37.388
Federal agents entered the terminal.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.891
-They must know you're here.
-How do they know we're here?

01:39.974 --> 01:41.476
[tense music playing]

01:46.105 --> 01:47.524
FBI. Show me your hands.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.609
-What's this about?
-You gotta have some idea.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.861
If not, you wouldn't be
standing in the doorway.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.321
This plane's been grounded.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.035
FBI. Who else is onboard?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.620
What? What's happening?

02:00.703 --> 02:01.996
Who else is onboard?

02:02.080 --> 02:05.458
Nobody. We're just preparing.
Our passengers haven't arrived.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.753
Marvin Gerard, where is he?

02:08.837 --> 02:10.630
I don't know who that is.

02:10.713 --> 02:13.174
Agent Zuma's gonna question you.
We need everyone off.

02:13.258 --> 02:17.095
We'll wait at the gate until he gets here.
Kill the engines. Seal that door.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.555
[engines power down]

02:21.391 --> 02:23.393
[suspenseful music playing]

02:29.858 --> 02:31.067
[Ressler] Hello, Marvin.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.252
[tense music playing]

02:49.335 --> 02:51.296
I'm sorry you're angry
that we got to him first.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.883
You didn't get to him first.
I had him and you took him.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.885
I would've done the same
and probably will.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.804
I know it's hard to accept
but this is how it has to be.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.639
Someone has to be held accountable,

03:01.723 --> 03:04.517
and if it's not Marvin,
Main Justice will go after Harold.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.103
It's not hard to accept.
It's unacceptable.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.022
He is mine to deal with.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.900
You'd really rather kill him,
even if it means I go to prison.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.403
I don't see either of those outcomes
as being inevitable.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.196
But let's be clear, Harold.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.698
You made your bed.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.617
With every crime you committed,

03:20.700 --> 03:23.661
with every day you let pass
without coming to me.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.290
So now you have no right
to put me at grave risk

03:27.373 --> 03:29.459
because you acted with reckless disregard.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.668
Disregard for what?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.045
[Raymond] Disregard for what?

03:32.128 --> 03:35.381
That conversation could begin and end
with Agnes alone.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.425
Elizabeth entrusted you with her daughter,

03:37.508 --> 03:38.468
you took her in,

03:38.551 --> 03:40.220
-you promised to protect her.
-That's right!

03:40.303 --> 03:41.763
-Enough.
-I wanna say this.

03:41.846 --> 03:46.017
I can't defend my mistakes except
to say I committed them for one reason.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.227
To stay out of prison.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.854
To somehow prevent that girl
from losing another parent.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.983
You've made a bigger mess of this
than either of you realize.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.527
That man is my attorney.

03:56.611 --> 04:01.115
Do you have any idea
how clever a person you'd have to be

04:01.199 --> 04:03.326
to fill that position?

04:18.383 --> 04:21.636
Normally, I'd let one of my people
question you, Marvin.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.639
But I wanted to do this myself.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.891
Doesn't sound like I'm in for questioning.

04:26.975 --> 04:30.019
Sounds like you intend to gloat

04:30.103 --> 04:30.979
or vent.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.772
I'm not gloating, Marvin.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.399
To be honest, I'm bereft.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.818
The loss of Elizabeth,

04:36.901 --> 04:39.696
the brutality of it,
especially coming from you,

04:39.779 --> 04:41.239
takes my breath away.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.616
But you're right,
I will take personal satisfaction

04:43.700 --> 04:45.034
in watching you go to prison.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.829
-You tried to destroy me.
-I'm not going to prison, Harold.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.124
If you don't realize that yet,
you will soon enough.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.835
You're wrong.
There's no deal coming, Marvin.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.087
We don't need your cooperation.
We have Raymond.

04:56.170 --> 04:59.507
-He can tell us anything you know.
-He can, but he won't.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.134
You're a puppet.

05:01.217 --> 05:05.221
The federal government sees 1 percent
of the Reddington organization,

05:05.305 --> 05:07.390
the 1 percent he allows you to see.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.683
The rest,

05:08.766 --> 05:11.936
the full scope of what we built together,

05:12.020 --> 05:13.896
is a criminal masterpiece,

05:13.980 --> 05:16.733
the likes of which you, respectfully,

05:16.816 --> 05:19.986
don't have the talent to comprehend.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.654
But let me guess.

05:21.738 --> 05:25.241
You'll tell me about it
in exchange for less time in a cell?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.952
I don't plan
on telling you anything, Harold.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.039
Because you are an underling.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.915
I'm not even talking to you now.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.250
I'm talking...

05:34.834 --> 05:35.835
to her.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.379
Hello, Cynthia.

05:39.088 --> 05:42.550
You really think she's listening after
what you did to Elizabeth? And to me?

05:45.553 --> 05:46.471
[Marvin] Yes, Harold.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.638
I do.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.853
[ominous music playing]

05:57.815 --> 05:59.025
Relax, Carolyn.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.693
We're on the move. Chuck?

06:00.777 --> 06:03.863
The courthouse?
Of all the places for us to meet.

06:03.946 --> 06:04.989
I'm aware of the risk.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.785
The fact that I took it should be
all the indication you need

06:08.868 --> 06:11.537
-of just how urgent this is.
-I spoke with my father.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.415
-How is Alfred?
-Alive and in a pretty good mood,

06:14.499 --> 06:17.085
considering his prostate's
the size of a grapefruit.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.378
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Well, he's 83.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.882
You could've killed him at 63,
so he knows he's living on borrowed time.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.092
I'm glad I didn't.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.053
Why didn't you? He never likes
to talk about your arrangement.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.348
Sounds like Alfred.
God knows I've done far worse to others

06:30.431 --> 06:34.727
for stealing a fraction
of what he embezzled from my organization.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.020
Why didn't I?

06:36.896 --> 06:37.772
You.

06:37.855 --> 06:41.109
When I found out that he was only stealing

06:41.192 --> 06:44.821
so he could afford to help his only child
pay for law school--

06:44.904 --> 06:46.739
You saw an opportunity.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.950
I don't know about that.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.204
It's easy to be prophetic
when you're older and looking back.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.498
At the time, I just liked your father

06:55.581 --> 06:58.543
and decided to call it
an investment in the future.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.836
My future?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.463
It's a strange feeling

07:02.547 --> 07:05.675
knowing my legal education
was paid for by a criminal.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.385
It's not so bad, Carolyn.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.471
I may be a criminal,
but I'm also the most wanted.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.265
It's nice to be wanted.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.725
So this is it?

07:14.809 --> 07:15.685
The payback?

07:16.436 --> 07:19.313
You're finally asking for the favor
my father promised you

07:19.397 --> 07:21.190
in exchange for his life?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.234
Parenthood is a remarkable thing.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.361
The selflessness of it.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.114
Your father risked everything to help you.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.450
And I'm sure wanted nothing in return.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.577
But I'm not your parent, Carolyn.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.995
So yes.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.621
It's time.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.127
Okay, Mr. Gerard.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.212
We all see what's happening here.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.923
You went to war with Reddington
and you lost.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.468
Now you're looking to damage your enemy.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.803
Mm... not exactly.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.347
You're a senator, Cynthia. Think bigger.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.725
No?

07:56.726 --> 07:59.896
I'm not interested in damaging
Raymond Reddington.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.274
I'm interested in replacing him.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.401
You wanna say that again?

08:06.027 --> 08:07.153
[Marvin] Come on.

08:07.236 --> 08:10.448
We all know that this arrangement
you made with Raymond

08:10.531 --> 08:13.075
is a lot more
than the government bargained for.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.368
He's uncontrollable.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.037
He continues to commit crimes.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.831
The task force is, frankly, off the rails.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.957
Is that so?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.167
Are you kidding me?

08:21.250 --> 08:24.962
The assistant director of the FBI
is responsible for half a dozen felonies.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.673
Yes, because you targeted
and blackmailed him.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.051
No. I mean, yes, I did do that.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.428
But Harold always had a choice.

08:32.512 --> 08:36.516
He didn't have to break the law.
He could've refused. But he didn't. Why?

08:36.599 --> 08:41.020
Because Harold is the way he is after
all these years of working with Raymond.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.064
Oh, that's rich.

08:43.940 --> 08:48.152
I'm offering you and your bosses
the chance to start over.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.239
I'm the man behind the curtain, Cynthia.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.407
I run Reddington's organization.

08:53.491 --> 08:57.161
Which is why I can deliver
the same end product.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.164
I can maintain the Blacklist.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.124
I have access to the same intel

09:02.208 --> 09:05.920
and can be a far more reliable partner
to the Justice Department

09:06.003 --> 09:07.588
than Reddington ever was.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.298
[Panabaker] You murdered Agent Keen,

09:09.382 --> 09:10.675
framed Harold,

09:10.758 --> 09:13.261
and now you wanna use
the chaos you created

09:13.344 --> 09:15.346
as proof that we need a change?

09:15.429 --> 09:16.806
I'm the better option.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.224
[Panabaker] That's not clever.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.725
It's insidious.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.810
Is it?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.562
My offer is simple.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.355
He's out. I'm in.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.565
I get his deal.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.859
And in exchange,
I continue to provide Main Justice

09:28.943 --> 09:32.572
with a steady stream of criminals
you don't even know exist.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.866
And what happens to Reddington?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.201
That's the best part.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.704
Main Justice gets what it always wanted.

09:39.787 --> 09:40.621
Arrest him.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.665
Drop him in a hole somewhere.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.084
This task force will never work with you.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.002
That's true.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.087
That's why we gotta get rid of them too.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.006
We start a new task force.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.717
The Marvin Gerard task force.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.220
You honestly think
the attorney general will go for that?

09:56.304 --> 09:57.179
I do.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.431
And if we hurry up,

09:58.514 --> 10:01.851
we might even be able to get this thing
up and running by the end of the week.

That's inmate talk for
Calvin Coolidge Correctional Facility.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.121
He's being closely guarded.
Only allowed in his cell or the library.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.291
-'Cause he's representing himself.
-It's a nightmare scenario.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.626
[Cooper] It may get even darker.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.462
If Marvin's offer is accepted,
Raymond will be arrested.

10:29.545 --> 10:30.963
What happens to us?

10:31.047 --> 10:33.591
I don't know,
I assumed you'd all be reassigned.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.010
If I'm not being prosecuted,
maybe I'll retire.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.596
What do you mean "if"?
We did what they wanted.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.098
-We arrested Marvin.
-That was never a guarantee.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.769
The irony is, now that we found him,
we have to protect Marvin from Reddington.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.354
[Cooper] One of us is going to prison.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.939
If Raymond kills Marvin,
I don't like my chances.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.734
I can keep an eye on Raymond,
see what he's planning.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.402
Great. I'll go with you.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.446
Alina, you can't be in the field.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.531
I won't be. I'll be in the car.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.825
I can't even do surveillance?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.118
What's the latest?

11:01.202 --> 11:03.579
I'll be seeing a top neurologist
in D.C. today.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.206
If he clears me, I'm back.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.123
If not...

11:06.791 --> 11:08.876
this could be my last assignment.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.044
Okay.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.588
But stay in the car.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.222
[tense music playing]

11:21.305 --> 11:22.765
He's just sitting there.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.226
-How long ago did he leave?
-[Dembe]<i> Ten minutes.</i>

11:25.309 --> 11:27.520
He left the warehouse and drove here.

11:27.603 --> 11:32.108
He's less than half a mile from Marvin.
That is probably not a coincidence.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.610
Hang on. There's another car approaching.

11:39.073 --> 11:42.284
-What's happening?
-Reddington's talking to the driver.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.538
I don't recognize him.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.334
I'm sending you photos to run
for facial recognition.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.087
[Dembe] <i>He obviously knows who Raymond is.</i>

11:54.922 --> 11:57.925
[Park] Wait a minute.
Reddington's handing him something.

11:59.927 --> 12:00.970
It's cash.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.972
-For what?
-[Aram] I got the photos.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.225
I'm running his image
through Bureau databases now.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.979
There he is.
A Lieutenant Theodore Heneveld.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.440
He's a guard
at the Coolidge Correctional Facility.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.357
Unbelievable.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.401
Reddington really is gonna kill Marvin.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.527
You want us to move in?

12:16.610 --> 12:20.448
[Aram]<i> Negative. You stay in the car.</i>
<i>Actually, both of you, get back here now.</i>

12:21.031 --> 12:23.659
-So now what?
-Marvin's in serious danger.

12:23.742 --> 12:27.830
Get out to Coolidge. Arrest Heneveld,
bring him in for questioning.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.499
[indistinct chatter]

12:38.632 --> 12:40.634
[ominous music playing]

12:43.679 --> 12:44.680
Can I help you?

12:45.723 --> 12:46.807
Are you him?

12:46.891 --> 12:50.144
I'm gonna need a little more context
for that question.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.981
The others say you're Marvin Gerard,

12:54.064 --> 12:56.567
Mr. Raymond Reddington's
personal attorney.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.652
I know Raymond.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.404
And you are?

13:01.155 --> 13:03.240
He knows me by the name Wujing.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.201
You're Wujing?

13:07.036 --> 13:11.832
The most prolific assassin who ever worked
for the Chinese State Security Service?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.459
May I sit?

13:13.542 --> 13:16.128
You've murdered more American operatives
than I can name.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.088
What am I gonna say? No?

13:22.218 --> 13:23.260
Why are you here?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.721
I'm not gonna be here very long.

13:25.804 --> 13:28.974
How about we just keep this about you?

13:29.058 --> 13:33.312
Well, I'm serving a life sentence
with no chance of parole.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.565
My only hope of seeing my kin
and my country again

13:36.649 --> 13:38.067
is to escape this...

13:38.943 --> 13:39.777
place.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.779
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.322
I don't need luck.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.158
After years of planning,
I'm finally close.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.955
We have succeeded in placing
someone on the inside

13:51.038 --> 13:53.999
on the transport team
at the Bureau of Prisons.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.544
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.338
The next time I'm taken to the courthouse,

13:59.421 --> 14:03.384
this inside man will be waiting
to set me free.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.011
And you're telling me this because?

14:06.095 --> 14:07.054
You're a lawyer.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.515
Not just a lawyer. Reddington's lawyer.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.892
That means you must be brilliant.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.978
You are brilliant, yes?

14:14.645 --> 14:17.106
-Yes.
-Well, my lawyers have tried

14:17.189 --> 14:21.235
and have been unable to secure for me
a trip to the courthouse.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.280
They've filed motions
and each one has been denied.

14:24.864 --> 14:29.785
All I need is a reason for the judge
to grant me some form of hearing.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.332
Ineffective assistance of counsel.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.126
Your lawyers have tried everything

14:37.209 --> 14:40.921
except for the one motion
that means they're terrible lawyers.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.550
If you claim
that your own lawyers are incompetent,

14:44.633 --> 14:47.720
I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts

14:47.803 --> 14:49.346
you'll get your hearing.

14:49.930 --> 14:50.764
So...

14:51.765 --> 14:53.726
you are Marvin Gerard.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.978
You're damn right I am.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.857
[ominous music playing]

15:02.359 --> 15:03.986
That look tells me you have news.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.112
Good or bad?

15:05.195 --> 15:08.282
Only kind you get around here, Harold.
Good and bad.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.658
I can guess the bad.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.996
The attorney general
wants to take Marvin up on his offer.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.416
-You don't seem surprised.
-On the contrary, I'm stunned.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.127
Every time I think I know
how stupid Main Justice can be,

15:20.210 --> 15:21.295
there's a new low.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.839
AG's not stupid, Harold. He's embarrassed.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.258
Not many know about
our deal with Reddington,

15:26.342 --> 15:27.551
but of those who do,

15:27.635 --> 15:30.971
there are plenty who think it's beneath
our government's integrity

15:31.055 --> 15:33.682
to partner with a criminal of his stature.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.392
I've heard those arguments.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.477
They're theoretical.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.521
Those people don't experience
the reality of our association.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.441
No, what they experience
are classified briefings

15:42.524 --> 15:44.526
about the crimes he still commits.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.403
Briefings about the death of Agent Keen

15:46.487 --> 15:49.865
and the felonies being committed
by the assistant director of the FBI.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.910
No, they don't get a sense
of the full reality,

15:52.993 --> 15:55.955
but what they do see
makes them wanna cringe.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.499
Reddington's out.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.000
Arrest warrant's been issued.

16:00.084 --> 16:03.879
AG expects you to take him into custody
next time he's in your company.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.882
-And us?
-You're out too.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.511
There's a new task force
being sourced as we speak.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.430
You said you had good news?

16:14.056 --> 16:14.932
Well, uh...

16:16.517 --> 16:19.853
I undersold,
because it's not good, it's great.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.441
Main Justice has agreed not to charge you.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.527
-On which counts?
-All of them.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.529
It worked, Harold.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.740
They're happy.
They feel smart and in control.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.409
Congratulations.

16:33.492 --> 16:37.788
The moment Marvin's deal takes effect,
their promise to you becomes binding.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.129
[tense music playing]

16:45.212 --> 16:47.631
[Park] What did you do before your shift,
Mr. Heneveld?

16:47.715 --> 16:48.549
Nothing.

16:48.632 --> 16:51.218
A secret meeting with
the most wanted man in the world?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.512
A jury might consider that something.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.139
[Dembe] Your career is over.

16:55.222 --> 16:59.560
The only question now is whether
your colleagues will end up guarding you.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.186
Hope you were good to the inmates.

17:01.270 --> 17:05.274
Save the heavy hand for the next guy.
I'm not making this any harder.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.485
-What was the meeting about?
-You won't believe me.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.778
Try us.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.281
He wants to break into the Cooler.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.701
His lawyer's being held there.
He wants to meet with him.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.036
Why'd he come to you?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.955
He knows I move contraband
in and out of there.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.249
One of the inmates, Flori Pascual,

17:22.332 --> 17:24.710
his cousin's high in the Quito Cartel,

17:24.793 --> 17:28.088
they built a passageway
so they could send him things.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.339
A passageway.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.091
-A tunnel?
-I don't know.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.969
There's a vent behind the boiler
in one of the sub-basements.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.763
They leave stuff behind the grate.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.848
I get it and distribute it.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.934
The passageway has to be big enough
for a person to pass through.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.103
Reddington knows the access point.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.273
I'm supposed to be waiting
at the grate to let him in.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.735
You were right.
Reddington won't stop until Marvin's dead.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.529
Can you imagine the hubris
to break into a federal prison

17:52.613 --> 17:54.323
and murder an inmate?

17:54.406 --> 17:55.657
We'll get Gerard out.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.369
We have to transport him to the courthouse
so a judge can sign his immunity deal.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.122
Agent Zuma and I'll
make sure that tunnel's shut down.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.500
Raymond's not getting into that prison.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.465
[ominous music playing]

18:12.841 --> 18:16.261
I almost destroyed my career
a thousand times in this job.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.722
I figured I'd finally do it
when I came face to face

18:18.806 --> 18:21.308
with whoever really killed Elizabeth Keen.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.479
I think I'd do it if I were
the only one who'd pay the price.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.523
-You'd kill me?
-Probably.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.858
Then Cooper would end up going to jail

18:29.942 --> 18:32.945
and Agnes Keen would lose another parent.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.072
It makes me sick,

18:35.155 --> 18:37.324
knowing you're gonna get what you want.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.617
What I want?

18:38.700 --> 18:40.786
You think this is what I want?

18:40.869 --> 18:43.580
I didn't beat Reddington. We both lost.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.583
I would've worked for him till the end.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.211
Now I'm an informant.

18:50.295 --> 18:54.550
Well, at least I am until Raymond
exacts his revenge.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.427
He's trying.
We're the ones protecting you.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.345
[scoffs]

18:58.428 --> 19:00.681
-You can't protect me.
-We can.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.975
Reddington had a plan
to get into the prison.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.726
We're shutting it down.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.937
Yeah. This plan. This time.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.731
There will always be another.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.191
One day...

19:12.276 --> 19:13.861
one will succeed.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.112
Blanket immunity.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.572
I thought you'd be happy.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.741
I'm gonna take the deal, Donald.
But let's be clear.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.163
This is the worst day
of what's left of my life.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.875
[telephone rings]

19:27.958 --> 19:29.501
Judge Grunwald's chambers.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.087
Understood.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.005
I'll tell him.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.424
[man] They're early.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.010
Nobody's here yet, Your Honor.
Should be just a few more minutes.

19:38.093 --> 19:41.054
That was Tim Post,
the chief judge's clerk.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.599
-Judge Marquez would like to see you.
-Fine, schedule it.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.392
-No, I mean now.
-Now?

19:45.475 --> 19:47.102
I'm about to start a FISA hearing,

19:47.186 --> 19:49.479
my courtroom is closed,
the parties are here.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.522
Well, almost.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.233
Yes, Your Honor.
It's a special circumstance.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.652
That's why the judge would like a word
before you begin.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.739
Call the U.S. Attorney,
push the start by 15 minutes.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.658
If the defendant arrives before I'm back,
have him wait in here.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.953
-With his attorney?
-He is an attorney, representing himself.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.496
I'll be back.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.582
[ominous music playing]

20:19.635 --> 20:22.304
Plenty of room
for a person to pass through.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.598
Get him out of here.

20:24.681 --> 20:29.228
I want this block evacuated and sealed
while we complete our investigation.

20:32.689 --> 20:33.815
What's wrong?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.234
It just hurts.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.362
Knowing there won't be
justice for Elizabeth.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.821
I had to arrest Marvin.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.491
It's the only way I could keep
my promise to Agnes.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.700
What promise?

20:43.784 --> 20:46.286
It was the first night she stayed with us.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.835
[somber music playing]

20:57.381 --> 20:58.632
Did you eat anything?

21:00.425 --> 21:02.636
Charlene thought you might be hungry.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.389
Oh, what you got there?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.058
Did you make that?

21:09.685 --> 21:12.020
My mom and I made it together.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.566
Well, I like it.

I, uh, wanna say how sorry I am.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.709
I loved your mother.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.796
And I'm so extremely sad
that she's not here.

We're so very glad
to have you here with us.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.640
I think your mother picked us
because she thought

21:48.724 --> 21:51.476
we could be a good family,
and I think she was right.

24:40.770 --> 24:44.774
After all, my feelings for Elizabeth
weren't always rational.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.986
I was often emotional
rather than pragmatic.

24:48.069 --> 24:52.532
And you weren't entirely wrong
to wonder if Elizabeth was capable

24:52.616 --> 24:54.826

24:54.910 --> 24:58.121
Not entirely wrong, or even slightly.

24:58.830 --> 25:03.752
Still, however subjective my decision was,

the objective truth is
that it was mine to make.

it was your obligation

the promise stands.

35:14.403 --> 35:17.865
He won't punish you because Marvin
did something out of your control.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.535
-I'm sure there's more.
-[Panabaker] There is.

35:20.618 --> 35:23.663
He's rescinded his order
to have you arrested.

35:23.746 --> 35:26.165
Hm. Surprise, surprise.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.542
[Panabaker] He's being practical.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.877
He doesn't like it,
but we need the Blacklist.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.840
And if Marvin can't deliver it,
he's willing to stay the course.

35:34.924 --> 35:37.510
-Like none of this ever happened.
-None of what, Harold?

35:38.010 --> 35:39.470
I've already forgotten.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.057
You really are quite something.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.561
At the moment, what I am is tired.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.773
I'm going away for a few weeks
to take the sisters home,

35:51.315 --> 35:54.861
eat some peyote, set up the telescope,
look at the night sky.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.906
Who knows? Maybe I'll find a new star
to name after you, Harold.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.116
I'll let you know.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.744
Please give my love to Agnes.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.872
Don't forget what tomorrow is, Raymond.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.792
Harold, I'll never forget
what tomorrow is.

36:28.686 --> 36:29.520
Okay.

36:30.855 --> 36:31.772
Here goes.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.986
It's been three years
since we lost Elizabeth.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.908
In some ways, it's gotten easier, but...

36:43.492 --> 36:45.912
in most ways, it still hurts.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.997
[somber music playing]

36:48.748 --> 36:51.417
There goes my hope
of doing this without crying.

36:52.335 --> 36:55.254
And, uh, this part won't be any easier.

36:57.089 --> 37:00.968
After a lot of careful reflection...

37:02.303 --> 37:06.474
I have decided to take some time away.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.560
I, uh, do not know how long but...

37:10.978 --> 37:12.104
I do know away.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.857
So, what's your plan?

37:15.483 --> 37:16.859
My plan is no plan.

37:17.902 --> 37:21.197
I, uh, found a cool place in Brooklyn.
I plan to go up there

37:21.280 --> 37:25.284
and just, you know, ride my bike,
do New York, eat lots of pizza.

37:25.368 --> 37:28.037
Look at the people. Maybe a Broadway show.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.123
Anyway, I know we are here
to talk about Elizabeth.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.918
I've been wanting to tell you guys.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.088
I think she'd like that idea.

37:40.216 --> 37:46.013
I remember when I saw she was a profiler
and I asked her to profile herself.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.224
[chuckles] What did she say?

37:48.307 --> 37:51.519
She described someone similar and yet...

37:53.271 --> 37:57.191
so, so different from the woman
I grew to know and love.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.152
I didn't like her.

38:01.862 --> 38:03.531
I mean, I came around, but--

38:05.491 --> 38:06.867
She really got to me.

38:09.453 --> 38:12.957
Alina, you made it. How did it go
with the Bureau neurologist?

38:13.040 --> 38:15.167
Well, not like I expected.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.087
Apparently, my headaches
have been getting worse

38:18.170 --> 38:20.589
because of a pretty
serious medical condition.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.341
I'm pregnant.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.676
[all exclaiming]

38:23.759 --> 38:25.177
-Oh, my God.
-Congratulations.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.304
That's wonderful news.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.806
Pete must be over the moon.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.474
So the headaches aren't permanent?

38:30.558 --> 38:32.852
They don't know, but they don't think so.

38:32.935 --> 38:35.313
Still, if it's okay,
I'd like to take a medical leave

38:35.396 --> 38:37.315
from the task force
until we know for sure.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.567
You'll be back in the field
before you know it.

38:39.650 --> 38:43.487
Maybe. Or maybe life's got other plans.

38:44.113 --> 38:47.992
Once the baby is born,
either way, I'll be great.

38:48.784 --> 38:52.455
Dembe. I think you're up.
Would you care to say anything?

38:53.998 --> 38:58.294
It was a little different for me
because my relationship with Elizabeth

38:58.377 --> 39:00.296
was always in terms of Raymond.

39:01.797 --> 39:05.885
I remember when Elizabeth was several
years younger than Agnes is now.

39:06.385 --> 39:09.180
Raymond and I went to a soccer match
she was playing in.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.640
The match was a disaster.

39:12.141 --> 39:14.060
All these girls running this way and that,

39:14.143 --> 39:18.397
a lot of missed goals
or goals made by accident,

39:18.481 --> 39:22.234
but it was so much fun.

39:23.569 --> 39:27.323
And after it was over,
I don't think anyone really cared or knew

39:27.406 --> 39:28.991
who won or lost.

39:29.075 --> 39:33.287
Everyone was standing around
having snacks and juices,

39:33.371 --> 39:37.708
comparing scrapes and bruises,
and there was a lot of noise and activity,

39:37.792 --> 39:41.253
but suddenly I heard this laugh.

39:42.546 --> 39:47.051
This sort of explosive, spontaneous laugh,

39:47.134 --> 39:53.974
young and so full of joy and infectious,
but also familiar.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.602
It was Elizabeth.

39:58.062 --> 40:01.941
But I turned to look next to me
because, just for a second,

40:02.024 --> 40:04.944
I thought it was Raymond.

40:08.447 --> 40:12.451
And some years later,
just before Elizabeth died,

40:12.535 --> 40:16.789
we all spent a few days together
in D.C. and New York.

40:16.872 --> 40:21.752
Raymond, Elizabeth, Agnes,
myself and Mrs. French.

40:21.836 --> 40:28.175
Just hanging around talking, eating,
playing board games, walking in the park.

40:28.259 --> 40:31.679
We went to a couple of museums,
got ice cream,

40:31.762 --> 40:34.765
and we just laughed with each other.

40:36.559 --> 40:39.895
Agnes, Elizabeth and Raymond.

40:41.063 --> 40:44.733
This funny little family
who all share that laugh.

40:45.609 --> 40:50.239
This one big, generous, mischievous,

40:50.322 --> 40:54.577
loving, hungry, wanting, tragic heart.

No. We're not going home.

Not until I find and kill
Raymond Reddington.

42:00.559 --> 42:03.604
Reddington?
Wujing, we can't do that alone.

42:03.687 --> 42:04.730
We won't have to.

42:04.813 --> 42:08.817

who will be glad to join the fight.
