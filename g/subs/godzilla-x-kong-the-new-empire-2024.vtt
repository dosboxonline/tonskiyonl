11:31.314 --> 11:32.774
What's up?

11:33.149 --> 11:34.108
Nothing.

11:34.192 --> 11:35.485
I'm worried about Kong.

11:39.697 --> 11:41.616
Why did you draw this?

11:43.576 --> 11:44.953
Can we go?

11:45.828 --> 11:46.704
Look at me.

11:48.081 --> 11:49.290
I don't belong here!

11:49.707 --> 11:51.668
I don't belong anywhere.

11:53.419 --> 11:55.421
You belong with me.

11:55.713 --> 11:57.548
And I belong with you.

13:24.427 --> 13:26.471
I'm scared something
is wrong with me.

13:27.972 --> 13:30.600
There is nothing wrong with you.

13:30.683 --> 13:32.018
You're perfect.

13:34.062 --> 13:36.647
I feel like I'm going crazy.

19:33.963 --> 19:35.464
He's hurt.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.156
Rest.

22:47.239 --> 22:48.741
You'll feel better.

22:53.245 --> 22:54.496
Looks good.

25:11.884 --> 25:13.427
I want to go with you.

25:14.428 --> 25:17.055
There are a thousand reasons
it's not safe for you down
there.

25:17.598 --> 25:19.266
Something is calling me.

25:21.727 --> 25:24.229
"You belong with me,
I belong with you."

25:25.606 --> 25:28.609
Gonna use my own
words against me?

25:28.692 --> 25:29.610
Really?

25:30.027 --> 25:31.945
Besides, you may
need me for Kong.

25:42.706 --> 25:45.042
You will stay near
me at all times.

30:48.011 --> 30:49.971
Ground to Monarch station...

30:51.181 --> 30:52.974
...we're closing in
on Godzilla's position.

31:13.662 --> 31:15.539
The reactors are compromised!

31:16.331 --> 31:18.083
This whole area is irradiated!

31:19.167 --> 31:20.836
We need to retreat!

39:35.872 --> 39:36.956
It's getting stronger.

39:38.082 --> 39:39.626
It came from around there.

39:40.001 --> 39:40.835
You sure...?

44:54.315 --> 44:56.025
These are the
symbols of my people!

45:14.460 --> 45:16.337
What happened to them?

46:22.403 --> 46:24.030
This site was a temple...

46:24.113 --> 46:25.531
...a place of worship.

48:39.915 --> 48:41.333
From my dreams.

56:40.270 --> 56:42.272
I can feel their thoughts.

58:04.521 --> 58:06.106
It's okay.

59:31.733 --> 59:32.984
This is where it came from.

01:17:28.142 --> 01:17:30.269
I lost home.

01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:49.940
I told him we need help.

01:44:02.526 --> 01:44:04.111
I'm so proud of you.

01:44:21.921 --> 01:44:23.964
I know that this place...

01:44:24.548 --> 01:44:26.217
...you feel like is home.

01:44:29.053 --> 01:44:30.846
And I want you to know that

01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:34.058
whatever you decide

01:44:34.141 --> 01:44:35.434
I support.

01:44:36.977 --> 01:44:38.479
What are you talking about?

01:44:39.813 --> 01:44:41.482
I assumed you wanted to stay.

01:44:43.108 --> 01:44:45.277
Wherever we go,
whatever we do...

01:44:45.361 --> 01:44:47.071
...we do it together.

01:44:48.197 --> 01:44:51.825
This place could be your home.

01:44:54.745 --> 01:44:56.580
You. Are. My. Home.
