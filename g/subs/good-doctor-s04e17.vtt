WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.670
Don't put any food down the sink.

00:03.753 --> 00:05.255
Garbage disposal's broken.

00:05.338 --> 00:07.090
-I'll call the landlord.
-All right.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.510
He took a week to call the plumber
when we lost the hot water,

00:10.593 --> 00:12.721
but I guess this doesn't matter as much.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.348
We'll just use the regular trash.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.433
Yes.

00:21.062 --> 00:24.649
10% to 15% of known pregnancies
end in miscarriage.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.359
This wasn't unusual.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.238
No. You're right.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.033
We're not the only people
to go through this.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.952
The best thing to do
is to just get back to normal.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.705
Hmm.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.249
I'm glad you're going back into work.

00:41.332 --> 00:44.169
Couple more days of rest,
and I'll be doing that, too.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.633
Are you sure you're all right?

00:52.886 --> 00:55.430
"All right" is stretching it,

00:55.513 --> 00:56.931
but yeah.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.476
We just need some time.

01:17.786 --> 01:18.995
[exhales deeply]

01:26.503 --> 01:28.922
[melancholic version
of theme music playing]

01:46.523 --> 01:47.982
How you feeling?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.234
All right.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.363
How's Lea doing?

01:53.446 --> 01:55.573
She thinks we need time. I agree.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.243
Hey, Shaun. How are you feeling?

01:59.494 --> 02:02.455
All right. And Lea thinks we need time.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.165
I didn't expect to see you here.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.501
You have a few days leave.
I thought you'd be home.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.336
I prefer to work.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.130
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:10.213 --> 02:12.507
Well, we respect your judgment.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.217
Bon appétit.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.143
Gastric reflux
causing projectile vomiting.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.733
I'm clearing your schedule for the next…
How many days?

02:30.817 --> 02:35.405
Oh. Well, that is up to my lovely
and talented doctors.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.448
Welcome to St. Bonaventure, Senator Clark.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.783
Oh, please. Marian.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.327
Oh, Marian, I am a huge supporter.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.955
You had my vote
in the presidential primaries.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.540
Thank you, Dr. Browne.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.000
-Oh, Claire.
-Claire.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.460
If only there'd been
another couple million like you.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.628
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.093
It's okay. Nothing wrong
with a balanced ticket.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.263
I was in my hotel this morning,
going over my speech,

03:00.346 --> 03:03.182
when this started happening to my face.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.059
Whole left side went rogue,

03:05.143 --> 03:07.478
blinking and twitching like crazy.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.855
Has it happened before?

03:08.938 --> 03:10.523
This was the third time.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.066
Fortunately, all in private.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.235
Needless to say,
I had to cancel my appearance.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.528
Can I see that again?

03:15.612 --> 03:17.780
Oh. I'm sorry. I just deleted it.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.243
The only thing worse than people
seeing my twitchy face in person

03:22.327 --> 03:24.787
is them seeing my twitchy face
on a hacked video.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.872
Mm.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.167
So, how do we go about
deleting it from my body?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.711
It's a hemi-facial spasm.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.923
We should do an MRI to rule out
the more serious possible causes.

03:35.006 --> 03:35.840
Which are?

03:35.924 --> 03:38.301
Aneurysm, MS, possibly a brain tumor.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.345
[sighs] What are the less serious causes?

03:40.428 --> 03:42.889
Stress, exhaustion, too much coffee.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.016
[chuckles]
Well, that's my job description.

03:45.099 --> 03:48.478
Which can be treated
with Botox injections and Ativan.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.896
Ah. Sold.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.856
We still need to do the MRI.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.234
Do both.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.905
Oh. As Claire knows,
I always have to control the agenda.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.496
Hi. Artie Hill.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.414
I have mild heart failure.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.499
I'm Dr. Park.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.668
How do you know
you have mild heart failure?

04:11.751 --> 04:14.754
I'm tired, and I've been
having palpitations.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.298
We'll run tests,
but if it makes you feel better,

04:17.382 --> 04:20.885
a lot of people have palpitations,
and it doesn't usually mean heart failure.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.471
Yeah, but I was just talking
to my doctor on the phone,

04:23.554 --> 04:25.723
and he told me I have heart failure.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.475
The doctor who did my bypass.

04:27.558 --> 04:28.768
Your bypass?

04:29.602 --> 04:32.188
He told me I should
go to the nearest emergency room.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.399
I was in the park,
looking at the cherry trees,

04:34.482 --> 04:36.442
and I started feeling funny, so I called…

04:36.526 --> 04:37.694
When was this bypass?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.195
-Um…
-[man] A month ago.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.031
Paul Nakano.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.742
I performed his surgery
at San Jose General.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.329
Mr. Hill, I hope you took a taxi,
as I asked you to.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.622
It was only three blocks.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.085
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get a 12-lead EKG,

04:54.168 --> 04:56.629
cardiac CT, and bloodwork.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.590
Ordinarily, I'd be thinking about
volume overload as the cause…

04:59.674 --> 05:01.801
But in this case,
sodium and B.U.N. are normal.

05:01.884 --> 05:05.221
The next thing I'd look at is
a post-op myocardial infarction.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.432
But in this case,
the troponins are normal.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.059
So you know what I'm thinking?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.228
Yes. You did your job too damn well.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.356
The heart's been so strengthened
from the bypass

05:15.440 --> 05:17.358
that it's revealed
a weakness in the valve.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.068
It can't handle
the pump pressure.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.153
Hmm.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.367
Dr. Nakano was my Chief of Surgery
when I was a resident.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.411
Hmm.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.038
So, when do you want to
open him up?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.331
I'm hoping never.

05:31.414 --> 05:35.335
Have either of you ever done
a transcatheter aortic valve replacement?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.128
I've read about it.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.422
It's minimally invasive and way preferable

05:39.505 --> 05:42.008
to opening up the patient
for the second time in a month.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.093
Well, I look forward
to learning from you again.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.261
Hmm.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.015
[grunts]

05:51.517 --> 05:53.352
[monitor beeping]

05:54.479 --> 05:58.149
Oh. Excuse me! Sir? Person in the hall?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.114
Oh, sorry.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.950
Hello. I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.
I am a surgeon.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.287
Uh, I-I can't find my socks.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.498
And I can't find the button
to call someone.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.045
Ah. [chuckles]

06:19.128 --> 06:21.714
Now, why would they put it there?
You can't even see it.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.007
What about the socks?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.263
[Artie clears throat]

06:29.722 --> 06:31.057
I have mild heart failure.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.351
I was in the park,
looking at the cherry trees…

06:33.434 --> 06:35.728
Cherry trees aren't in bloom
at this time of year.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.146
Well,
I can still look at them.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.649
They don't disappear
just because the blossoms fall.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.736
Mm. I can get you socks
from the pre-op supplies area.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.031
Ah, yes. I remember those
crappy socks they give you. I'll take 'em.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.784
Why do you guys keep it
so cold in here?

06:49.867 --> 06:51.285
My feet are freezing.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.252
[woman 1 on TV]
<i>It's beautiful to look at</i>

06:59.335 --> 07:01.462
<i>if you're inside</i>
<i>and don't have to go anywhere.</i>

07:01.546 --> 07:04.090
<i>And you might not want</i>
<i>to go anywhere if you don't…</i>

07:04.173 --> 07:05.508
[woman 2]
<i>Take care of Arthur.</i>

07:05.591 --> 07:07.510
<i>But he lost his silly head</i>
<i>and shot Br…</i>

07:07.593 --> 07:09.720
<i>Every night, we have three clients a week</i>

07:09.804 --> 07:11.097
<i>who think I'm waiting tables…</i>

07:11.180 --> 07:13.182
[instrumental music playing]

07:14.267 --> 07:15.476
[TV shuts off]

07:16.185 --> 07:18.020
[cell phone ringing]

07:21.315 --> 07:22.316
[cell phone beeps]

07:25.945 --> 07:27.155
[sighs]

07:33.327 --> 07:36.497
We'll use a pigtail catheter
to place the guide wire,

07:36.581 --> 07:39.625
then run a delivery catheter
through an 18 French sheath

07:39.709 --> 07:43.588
to ferry the new valve
through the femoral artery to the heart.

07:43.671 --> 07:46.883
Then we inflate a balloon
that expands the new valve

07:46.966 --> 07:49.218
and installs it
right inside his current one.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.137
[Shaun] That would kill him.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.934
He has cold feet.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.769
Who are you?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.730
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.899
He's one of my residents.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.318
Oh. Artie has cold feet?

08:05.401 --> 08:06.903
He's afraid of the procedure?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.447
No, I think Dr. Murphy means it literally.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.698
The patient has cold feet.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.783
Is his body temperature dropping?

08:12.867 --> 08:15.620
No, his core body temperature
is stable at 98.5.

08:15.703 --> 08:18.623
He rarely has cold feet. I got him socks.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.668
You're gonna need to
draw some dotted lines here for me.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.379
Okay. Cold feet means
impaired circulation,

08:25.463 --> 08:27.757
which means constricted
blood flow from the heart,

08:27.840 --> 08:29.217
which means a damaged vessel.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.011
If we try to push the new valve
through the damaged area,

08:32.094 --> 08:33.429
it will rip open, killing him.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.139
"Damaged vessel"?

08:35.223 --> 08:37.183
Yes. You make a mistake
during the bypass,

08:37.266 --> 08:39.101
most likely a tear in the aorta.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.395
I didn't make a mistake.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.481
Mm, you caused an aortic dissection.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.650
Shaun, this man has
more cardiac experience

08:45.733 --> 08:47.944
than everyone in this room times ten.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.531
A lot of people have cold feet.
My wife has cold feet.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.033
Everyone has cold feet in a hospital.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.703
Yes. We should perform
an angio on Mr. Hill.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.497
That will show the aortic dissection.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.416
This man recently underwent
an open heart surgery.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.335
He's gonna have valve replacement.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.921
We don't need to load him up
with yet another procedure

09:07.004 --> 09:08.839
when there was no mistake.

09:11.759 --> 09:16.430
Studies show that old people
are less likely to admit mistakes

09:16.514 --> 09:19.225
because they are less aware
when they've made one.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.274
Okay, Dr. Murphy, you've told us
your thoughts on this case.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.902
It's my understanding
that you have a few days of leave.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.195
I suggest you take them.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.780
I prefer to continue working.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.949
Then do it somewhere else.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.667
[Shaun] You…

09:45.418 --> 09:46.836
will kill him.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.892
You think my surgeon is wrong?

10:01.976 --> 10:02.977
Yes.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.771
And you're, like, a-a real doctor, right?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.690
I am a real doctor.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.902
No offense, but best heart guy around

10:11.986 --> 10:15.489
versus the guy who happened
to be passing my room when I needed socks.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.576
Why shouldn't I let Dr. Nakano
do what he thinks I need?

10:18.659 --> 10:20.661
If anything goes wrong, he can fix it.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.789
It could be difficult.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.167
The tip of the catheter would be likely

10:26.250 --> 10:29.128
to rupture your weakened aorta,
ripping it open and causing you

10:29.211 --> 10:32.757
to hemorrhage into your chest
and bleed out in a matter of minutes.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.717
If you survived,

10:34.800 --> 10:37.219
you'd have severe anoxic brain damage.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.598
But it's unlikely you'd survive.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.187
Go home.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.857
Is Mr. Hill requesting the angio?

10:49.940 --> 10:52.360
He's not just requesting.
He's demanding.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.404
This is why you take a leave of absence
when you need one.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.116
You're not thinking clearly or you never
would have pulled a stunt like this.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.786
I prefer to stay at work.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.996
I could assist with E.R. consults.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.502
Dr. Murphy,
because I'm being professional,

11:09.585 --> 11:12.546
you may not understand
how angry I am right now.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.096
Will you do what Mr. Hill wants?

11:20.179 --> 11:21.806
What you want, you mean?

11:22.890 --> 11:25.101
Yes, we'll do it. You've forced our hand.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.521
Good.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.450
I would have fired him.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.455
[chuckles]

11:46.539 --> 11:48.874
Honey, when Freya brings you a dead rat,

11:48.958 --> 11:50.709
she's offering you a gift.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.212
[Pete chuckles] <i>I know.</i>
<i>I waited until she was gone</i>

11:53.295 --> 11:54.922
<i>so she wouldn't see me toss it away.</i>

11:55.005 --> 11:56.465
-[chuckles]
<i>-Wish you were here.</i>

11:56.549 --> 11:58.092
<i>You could strike the right balance</i>

11:58.175 --> 11:59.927
<i>between enthusiasm</i>
<i>and discouragement.</i>

12:00.010 --> 12:02.221
Oh. Honey, I gotta go.
My doctors are here.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.931
<i>You sure everything is okay there?</i>

12:04.014 --> 12:06.559

What else do you have for me?

12:14.358 --> 12:17.278
I had another episode.
It was shorter, but still there.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.989
The MRI shows a branch
off the basilar artery

12:20.072 --> 12:21.699
that's compressing the facial nerve.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.535
Unfortunately, you have
a "tortuous" artery.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.121
Where it should be straight,
it bends and twists.

12:27.204 --> 12:30.332
Bad news is, it'd be a nightmare
to try and address this surgically.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.584
Good news…

12:31.667 --> 12:33.502
Is, other than some twitching,

12:33.586 --> 12:35.379
which is minimized by the Botox,

12:35.463 --> 12:37.131
it's not causing any other problems.

Exactly.

it'll be all over social media.

mock me relentlessly.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.027

We could meet in the middle.

Tortuous or not,
the main basilar isn't causing the spasms.

So we leave it alone and just sling up

to justify not telling her husband
about this surgery,

17:51.111 --> 17:53.238

You wouldn't have fired him.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.762
Oh, no.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.180
No. We wouldn't.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.724
[quietly] Just hang up. Just…

26:40.807 --> 26:42.851
Okay. I should go.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.145
<i>And now that we know it's a girl,</i>
<i>I was wondering…</i>

26:45.228 --> 26:47.731
<i>I already bought a onesie</i>
<i>with little dinosaurs on it.</i>

26:47.814 --> 26:48.815
<i>Unbelievably cute.</i>

26:48.898 --> 26:50.358
Mm. Cute. Yes.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.277
Okay, that sounds good.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.570
I am due at the hospital.

26:53.653 --> 26:54.696
<i>Just a quick question.</i>

26:54.779 --> 26:57.115
<i>Since it's not a boy,</i>
<i>the dinosaurs will have to go.</i>

26:57.198 --> 26:58.825
<i>What would be nice for a girl?</i>

26:58.908 --> 27:00.035
I don't… I don't know.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.578
<i>There's one with ballet shoes.</i>

27:01.661 --> 27:03.788
That's stupid.
Why would you have to change it?

27:03.872 --> 27:06.082
A girl would like dinosaurs
just as much as a boy.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.501
Dinosaurs are fascinating.
You need to shut up.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.379
<i>Um…</i>

27:12.797 --> 27:14.090
[Pam sighs]

27:14.174 --> 27:15.675
<i>-Shaun?</i>
-[cell phone beeps]

27:25.268 --> 27:28.813
As you all know, Senator Clark
is a very competitive person.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.274
<i>She tore her meniscus</i>
<i>while charging the net</i>

27:31.358 --> 27:32.484
<i>to return a drop shot.</i>

27:32.567 --> 27:35.028
<i>For the record,</i>
<i>it was match point, which she won.</i>

27:35.111 --> 27:36.154
<i>She underwent…</i>

27:36.237 --> 27:38.698
I wonder if he negotiates
employment contracts.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.493
<i>And thanks to the terrific doctors</i>
<i>here at St. Bonaventure,</i>

27:41.576 --> 27:43.995
<i>she'll be back fighting for you</i>
<i>before you know it.</i>

27:44.079 --> 27:45.538
<i>Senator Clark</i>
<i>wanted to thank all…</i>

27:45.622 --> 27:47.332
Oh, did you hear that?
We're terrific.

27:47.415 --> 27:49.918
You must be. You repaired
her meniscus through her head.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.170
It's no one's business why she's here.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.756
And there's the rationalization
I've been waiting for.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.466
If this was someone you didn't like,

27:56.549 --> 27:58.885
these character flaws
would reveal some deep problem

27:58.968 --> 28:01.054
worthy of your eternal judgment,
but since…

28:01.137 --> 28:02.347
You're head of department.

28:02.430 --> 28:04.766
I'm sure you've had to
spin things sometimes.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.601
"Spin things"? Sure.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.103
Lie? No.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.772
<i>Just one more example of how</i>
<i>Senator Clark has been able…</i>

28:10.855 --> 28:12.941
And that was an example of both.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.859
[cell phones chime]

28:15.652 --> 28:17.153
Marian isn't waking up.

28:18.279 --> 28:22.367
<i>And to that end, she's already making</i>
<i>calls and sending e-mails.</i>

28:22.450 --> 28:24.244
<i>Oh. And texts.</i>

28:24.327 --> 28:26.121
<i>She just told me to wrap it up.</i>

28:26.204 --> 28:28.039
[laughter]

28:35.755 --> 28:37.382
I yelled at your mother.

28:38.299 --> 28:39.300
Yeah.

28:41.052 --> 28:44.055
I misdiagnosed a patient.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.141
That's why they sent me home.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.270
I'm not behaving normally.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.606
Neither am I.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.192
But maybe this is normal
for where we're at.

29:00.989 --> 29:04.117
Dr. Glassman talked about
"facing my loss,"

29:04.200 --> 29:06.161
but I don't know what that means,

29:06.244 --> 29:08.246
and even if we could face it,

29:08.329 --> 29:11.249
won't we just hurt ourselves
for no reason?

29:11.791 --> 29:12.876
I don't know.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.920
I don't think
grief has an actual solution.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.631
It has to. I can't stay this way.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.307
Claire told me about this support group.

29:29.517 --> 29:33.354
I'm not sure we can just
force ourselves past this.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.697
The cold feet are not a coincidence.

29:44.491 --> 29:48.828
If they do the TAVR procedure,
they'll kill the patient.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.080
For a different reason.

29:58.379 --> 29:59.380
[door closes]

29:59.464 --> 30:01.299
[monitor beeping]

30:04.219 --> 30:05.970
[Nakano] The guide wire's in place.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.722
I'm preparing to deliver the valve.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.350
-[door opens]
-[Shaun] Okay, you… You have to stop.

30:10.433 --> 30:11.893
If that valve goes through…

30:11.976 --> 30:13.353
-Get out of here, Murphy.
-No.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.480
If that valve goes through, he'll die.

30:15.563 --> 30:18.107
-Call Security.
-I thought it was an aortic dissection,

30:18.191 --> 30:21.361
but I was wrong. The cold feet are
from a coarctation… No.

30:21.444 --> 30:23.780
No. No, no. It's too close.

30:23.863 --> 30:24.989
You're too close. Stop!

30:25.073 --> 30:27.158
-Stop! Stop, please! Stop!

Heart rate's up. He's gonna stroke.

B.P.'s dropping.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.756
He's starting to stabilize.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.011
Okay.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.100
Dr. Murphy?

30:53.351 --> 30:54.435
Go on.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.108
Dr. Nakano did not
make a mistake in the bypass.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.609
He did everything right.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.947
But Mr. Hill has a congenital narrowing
of the abdominal aorta.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.324
He's had that coarctation for year,
but never knew

31:08.408 --> 31:10.785
because his body compensated
for the poor circulation

31:10.869 --> 31:12.161
by raising his blood pressure,

31:12.245 --> 31:14.539
caused his heart to deteriorate,
requiring a bypass.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.041
The stronger, repaired heart
put pressure on the valve,

31:17.125 --> 31:20.003
and his blood pressure dropped.
No more compensation.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.170
His feet got cold.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.590
And I could get the guide wire up there,

31:23.673 --> 31:25.967
but the valve delivery system
would be too big

31:26.050 --> 31:29.220
to fit through the coarctation
without damaging the vessel.

31:29.679 --> 31:30.597
Yes.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.057
We'll have to open him up.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.854
And the valve will have to
be replaced directly…

31:37.937 --> 31:38.938
through surgery.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.817
I hope you'll join us for that.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.454
How's Cal gonna spin this?

no conflict with the seventh nerve,

32:05.798 --> 32:08.009
no bleeds, no strokes.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.262
The basilar is dilated.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.264
And compressing her brain stem.

-She's stopped breathing.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.393

[Cal] Tell them
she's gonna be at the conference.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.407
If they keep asking,
tell them the Senator believes

32:31.491 --> 32:33.868
anyone not ready to commit
on climate change action

32:33.952 --> 32:35.578
is on the wrong side of history.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.081
Just never use that phrase
more than once a month.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.958
-He has to run.
-[cell phone beeps]

32:40.041 --> 32:41.459
The sling procedure went fine,

32:41.542 --> 32:44.087
but the basilar artery
was less stable than we hoped.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.630
It's gotten even more dilated

32:45.713 --> 32:48.132
and is causing progressive
neurological deficits.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.760
We have no choice
but to bypass the artery.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.428
The last surgery was dangerous.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.638
This one way more so.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.058
What do you need me to sign?

32:57.141 --> 32:58.768
We should inform her husband.

32:58.851 --> 33:01.270
There is a one in four chance
that she could die.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.152
If I told Pete that,
he'd be at the airport in half an hour,

33:08.236 --> 33:11.739
and everyone would know that Marian is
in this hospital for something serious.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.242
She has a brain aneurysm.
That doesn't make her weak.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.327
Even worse. It makes her mortal.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.705
Her husband has a right to be here.

33:18.788 --> 33:21.165
A moral right. To destroy her career.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.084
Which is what I'm protecting her from.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.837
This is just a game to you,
isn't it?

33:25.920 --> 33:27.422
Yeah. The game they make you play

33:27.505 --> 33:29.007
before you can do anything real.

[Dr. Park] Looks like
we've got a paravalvular leak.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.454
We need to go back and fix this.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.664
[Nakano] Irrigate and check the image.

34:10.757 --> 34:11.758
No leak.

34:12.258 --> 34:15.219
Slight excess from the washing jets
in the mechanical valve.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.387
Normal finding.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.600
[Shaun] Wow. You're very good.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.060
I think he knows that.

We do that,

35:32.964 --> 35:34.924
Reduce the pressure from the inside.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.467
For her, it's worth the risk.

Arachnoid dissector.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.317
There was a patient admitted this morning
I think you should see.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.902
You thinking of Mrs. Cavanaugh?

35:54.986 --> 35:56.946
That's a good idea, Dr. Park.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.948
We'd welcome another take

35:59.031 --> 36:02.869
as to whether she's a good candidate
for inserting an ICD.

36:03.661 --> 36:06.497
I'll consult just on that question,
if you'd like me to.

36:08.082 --> 36:09.917
But I won't join in the O.R.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.253
I'm quitting surgery.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.133
I don't understand.
When did you decide…

36:18.259 --> 36:19.677
Fifteen minutes ago.

36:22.805 --> 36:26.017
I nearly closed up
without doing a final antibiotic lavage.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.936
But you didn't.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.980
Nurse Barker prompted you
with the syringe.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.108
It was a tiny error.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.611
There was no contamination of the field.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.238
Many surgeons don't even
do a final lavage.

36:39.322 --> 36:42.575
I always told myself
once I started making tiny errors,

36:42.658 --> 36:44.243
I'd stop before I made a big one.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.661
[Dr. Andrews] Paul,

36:45.745 --> 36:47.496
we almost lost a patient today.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.789
You were still rattled.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.375
Thank you, Marcus.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.921
But I made this plan years ago,

36:55.004 --> 36:57.506
because I knew that when the time came,

36:57.590 --> 37:00.301
I'd look for reasons
why whatever I did wrong

37:00.384 --> 37:03.888
was tiny, minor, didn't count.

37:05.431 --> 37:06.849
That's when I made the rule.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.227
Everything counts.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.526
Dr. Murphy, it was nice sewing with you.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.025

You're mad at me.

About little Evvie.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.284
[sighs]

38:06.367 --> 38:08.869
Well, Evvie inspired me.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.832
I took strength from her for years.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.668
Now it's all fiction.

38:18.087 --> 38:21.674
Fictional lives can save real lives.

38:22.508 --> 38:26.387
Four years ago, I used that story
on the Senate floor.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.598
I got my bill passed by one vote.

38:29.682 --> 38:33.769
That lie helped millions of people
with disabilities.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.398
I'm really proud of that lie.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.791
I'm heading out
to have a drink with Dr. Nakano.

38:56.417 --> 39:00.254
Are you going to try
to talk him out of leaving surgery?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.422
No.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.092
I'm going because
no one's meant to shoulder loss alone.

39:05.968 --> 39:08.179
And I'm the one
who should be with him tonight.

39:08.888 --> 39:09.972
Why?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.184
Because we love the same thing.

39:13.934 --> 39:17.438
And he knows no one would understand
what he's lost more than I would.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.240
[elevator bell dings]

39:40.753 --> 39:42.171
I have been thinking…

39:43.130 --> 39:45.841
about all the people you've helped,
including me.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.720
And about not…

39:50.846 --> 39:53.265
sharing the danger you were in
with your husband.

39:54.558 --> 39:57.186
Probably not sharing
a lot of other things.

39:58.604 --> 40:01.607
And it struck me that… [sighs]

40:02.274 --> 40:04.485
Being in a marriage like that
must be lonely.

40:08.322 --> 40:10.825
You can't trust him to lie.

40:12.284 --> 40:16.247
So you end up sharing more of yourself
with a guy like Cal,

40:16.330 --> 40:18.416
who is a hired gun
and who's gonna end up

40:18.499 --> 40:20.918
working for somebody else
two years from now.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.216
The fact that Pete and I don't talk shop

40:27.299 --> 40:29.510
doesn't make our marriage
less than wonderful.

40:35.641 --> 40:36.851
Another lie?

40:48.988 --> 40:50.239
Hey, hey!

40:50.322 --> 40:53.576
How 'bout those Devils, huh? [chuckles]

40:53.659 --> 40:56.370
But before I go all fan girl
about last night's game,

40:56.454 --> 41:00.249
let's talk about the upcoming
climate change conference.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.959
I have to tell you guys a story

41:02.042 --> 41:04.462
about a little boy
who lives on the Outer Banks

41:04.545 --> 41:06.338
of South Carolina,

41:06.422 --> 41:08.841
whose home is about to be washed away…

41:10.718 --> 41:15.473
<i>♪ I think if I fail again ♪</i>

41:16.474 --> 41:20.644
<i>♪ That I know you're still listening ♪</i>

41:20.728 --> 41:24.773
<i>♪ Maybe it's all gonna</i>
<i>Turn out all right… ♪</i>

41:24.857 --> 41:28.527
[sighs] I could get another mug,
or I could wash these.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.446
It's a tough decision.

41:31.780 --> 41:32.781
Mm.

41:33.449 --> 41:36.535
I should probably tell you,
I didn't get to calling the landlord.

41:39.079 --> 41:40.498
And maybe ten minutes ago,

41:40.581 --> 41:42.833
I saw a couple fruit flies
near the drain, so…

41:42.917 --> 41:46.879
<i>♪ I have to believe that it is ♪</i>

41:46.962 --> 41:49.048
<i>♪ Have to believe… ♪</i>

41:49.131 --> 41:52.134
[sighs] So… Yeah.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.515
[voice breaking]
Now it's my fault if we're…

41:58.390 --> 41:59.600
If we get bugs.

42:03.187 --> 42:07.608
<i>♪ When I tell you that it is ♪</i>

42:08.067 --> 42:12.571
<i>♪ Oh, it's not for my benefit ♪</i>

42:12.655 --> 42:18.077

<i>Turn out all right ♪</i>

42:18.160 --> 42:21.247
<i>♪ Oh, I know that it's not ♪</i>

42:21.330 --> 42:26.752
<i>♪ But I have to believe that it is ♪</i>

42:27.378 --> 42:28.379
[sniffles]

42:31.465 --> 42:33.467
