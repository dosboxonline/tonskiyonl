00:36.203 --> 00:37.037
[beeping]

00:38.205 --> 00:39.039
[person] Hmm.

00:40.624 --> 00:41.875
[owl hoots]

00:42.793 --> 00:43.627
Mmm.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.676
[sighs]

01:00.936 --> 01:02.646
[birds chirp in distance]

01:04.940 --> 01:07.901
[airplane approaches]

01:10.237 --> 01:11.071
[zipper opens]

02:01.079 --> 02:01.914
[gunshot]

02:25.145 --> 02:26.145
[gasps]

02:26.146 --> 02:28.232

[groans, pants]

03:10.065 --> 03:12.067
[waves lapping]

03:40.929 --> 03:41.763
[sighs]

03:48.061 --> 03:49.313
[sighs deeply]

03:50.814 --> 03:51.648
Hey.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.197
[beachgoers call in distance]

04:02.075 --> 04:03.118
[dog barks]

04:06.038 --> 04:07.539
[sighs]

04:11.460 --> 04:12.669
[phone chimes]

04:39.530 --> 04:41.615
Colonel, give us the room, please.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.958
Four years retired yet two salutes?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.336
- Shows respect.
- Have a seat.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.967
Do you know who I am?

05:00.717 --> 05:02.009
No.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.428
Well, if you were to guess.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.472
[sighs]

05:06.056 --> 05:07.890
Judging by your age, appearance,

05:07.891 --> 05:11.019
and how a Marine colonel
just followed your order without a yip,

05:11.854 --> 05:14.106
I'd guess you're some kind
of high-level spook.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.530
Your father and grandfather served?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.240
Yes.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.952
As an elite sniper,
you have 113 confirmed kills

05:27.953 --> 05:30.705
and an additional 81 probable kills.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.124
Are those numbers accurate?

05:32.624 --> 05:33.458
No.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.421
- Are the actual numbers fewer or greater?
- Greater.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.674
As a veteran, how many private contractors
have you worked for?

05:41.675 --> 05:42.592
Eleven.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.721
But you also still work for
the Marine Corps on occasion?

05:47.055 --> 05:48.389
Anytime they call.

05:48.390 --> 05:52.269
And are you presently under
any private or military contract?

05:54.146 --> 05:54.980
No.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.443
You're an extremely rare talent, Levi.

06:00.944 --> 06:01.778
Why not?

06:04.239 --> 06:07.450
In June, some corporate shrink
told me that I was unfit for a mission,

06:07.451 --> 06:09.243
but I'm sure you already know that.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.537
So why are you asking me?

06:13.624 --> 06:15.416
Do you think you're fit for service?

06:15.417 --> 06:16.960
Doesn't matter what I think.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.048
So, do you presently have a girlfriend?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.300
Anyone special?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.011
Someone who couldn't live without you?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.349
- No.
- Why not?

06:31.517 --> 06:33.060
Just not how it goes for me.

06:35.187 --> 06:39.315
How about meds, illegal drugs, alcohol?

06:39.316 --> 06:40.651
No drugs.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.568
But if I time it right,

06:42.569 --> 06:45.989
three and a half ounces of booze right
before I go to bed helps with the dreams.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.201
Have you tried Nitrazepam or Prazosin?

06:50.202 --> 06:52.037
Have you ever killed someone
at long range?

06:55.624 --> 06:57.084
Pills affect my accuracy.

07:00.629 --> 07:05.049
Levi, you could have contested
the psych test and seen another doctor.

07:05.050 --> 07:05.968
Why didn't you?

07:06.468 --> 07:07.593
I had no reason to.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.053
You had no reason?

07:09.054 --> 07:10.264
[sighs]

07:10.973 --> 07:13.642
There's not a lot of
reasons for me right now.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.853
[sighs]

07:19.606 --> 07:20.983
What if I gave you a reason?

07:26.738 --> 07:29.741
[accordion playing Bach's
"Cello Suite No.1 in G Major"]

07:41.086 --> 07:42.087
[playing stops]

07:43.463 --> 07:44.298
Hey, Daddy.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.678
[grunts]

07:57.603 --> 07:58.437
To music.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.856
[in Lithuanian] To music.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.483
My Little Lion...

08:04.484 --> 08:05.651
How are you?

08:05.652 --> 08:06.570
[in English] You know.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.405
Better now I see you.

08:08.906 --> 08:13.452
[in Lithuanian] There is a rumor
you were photographed in Belarus.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.412
A drone.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.123
Is that possible?

08:18.832 --> 08:24.171
Moscow cannot risk having a direct link
to the oligarch's death.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.511
[in English] He had four children.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.014
Give it to me.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.308
Give me your shame.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.697
[sighs]

08:52.908 --> 08:58.455
The Belarusian made himself rich trading
in white phosphorus bombs and land mines.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.875
How many children's legs were lost?

09:02.459 --> 09:06.380
How many little faces were forever burnt
by those transactions?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.633
You give the shame to me...

09:10.634 --> 09:11.718
[sighs]

09:17.099 --> 09:18.392
And you move forward.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.811
It's not so easy anymore.

09:22.855 --> 09:23.856
I don't sleep.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.482
Sometimes for days.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.987
Stay with me for a week or two.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.407
And we'll make a stew.
It would be good for both of us.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.325
I can't.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.328
Rabinovich has ordered me to a briefing
first thing tomorrow morning in Moscow.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.581
To hell with Rabinovich,
and to hell with Moscow.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.416
You're not Russian, you're Lithuanian.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.628
He says I'll be going dark
for at least a year.

09:47.796 --> 09:48.630
Perhaps more.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.092
Hey.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.094
Did you go to the doctor
I arranged for you?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.012
The specialist?

09:56.013 --> 09:58.098
- Yes, I did.
- And?

09:58.974 --> 10:00.600
There's nothing to be done.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.102
Look at me, I'm a wretch.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.813
Cancer eats me from the inside out.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.482
Liver, pancreas.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.485
Death will be a welcome change.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.487
And what if I'm not back?

10:12.988 --> 10:13.822
Hmm?

10:14.323 --> 10:17.910
You'll be alone,
and I won't even know when it happens.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.370
An easy solution.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.581
I've already decided.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.167
February 14th, Valentine's Day.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.211
What are you talking about?

10:27.836 --> 10:29.463
I'm going to do it myself.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.089
Assuming I'm not already dead, of course.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.175
Dad.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.180
- Dad, you're not--
- It's my life to take.

10:39.598 --> 10:43.060
I will be ready to finally rest here
next to your mother.

10:45.020 --> 10:49.982
So, wherever you are,
you light a candle for me,

10:49.983 --> 10:53.570
you look at the Hunter in the night sky,
then you'll know.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.823
[inhales deeply]

10:57.324 --> 10:59.785
Come on now, Little Lion.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.954
Let's have our beer,

11:02.829 --> 11:03.747
play a song,

11:05.082 --> 11:06.917
and say a proper goodbye.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.222
[airplane whirring]

11:21.223 --> 11:22.683
[clattering]

11:49.710 --> 11:51.044
[sighs]

11:51.753 --> 11:52.880
[door opens]

12:03.015 --> 12:04.725
[airman] Place your left hand on the pad.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.519
[beeping]

12:10.105 --> 12:12.482
Put your watch, your smart phone,
and your ID in the case.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.526
It just tells time.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.866
In three minutes,
we reach the edge of the no-fly zone.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.368
That's as far as we can take you.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.371
From the drop, you'll have
another 38 klicks north on foot.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.290
You're expected by 1600 hours tomorrow.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.709
Open it on the ground.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.215
[door opens]

12:37.216 --> 12:38.717
Where are we?

12:39.801 --> 12:41.386
I'm not authorized to answer that.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.098
[door opens]

14:06.722 --> 14:09.892
- [inhales deeply]
- At long last, my sweet prince has come.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.896
Punctual even. Spot on time. What a guy.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.858
Jasper D. Drake, Royal Marines Commandos.
Just call me JD.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.986
Levi Kane, former US Marine, scout sniper.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.154
Mercenary?

14:23.155 --> 14:24.947
- Private contractor.
- Hmm.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.616
So, what did they tell you
about this mission?

14:26.617 --> 14:27.868
Not a damn thing.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.578
They gave me an unmarked topo map.

14:30.579 --> 14:31.996
I don't even know what country I'm in.

14:31.997 --> 14:34.666
I've been here an entire year
and I have no idea where I am.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.335
It's messed up, right?

14:36.835 --> 14:39.213
But that is just
the tippity-top of the iceberg.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.632
Man, am I glad to see you.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.966
Not a lot of contact, huh?

14:43.967 --> 14:47.012
You're the first person
I've spoken to face-to-face in a year.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.139
- You're all alone out here?
- Mm-hmm.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.017
And my tour rotation
officially ends at midnight.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.685
- So I'm the relief?
- Affirmative.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.064
Look, we'll get a drink
and I'll explain everything.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.316
There she is.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.526
West Tower Observation Post.

15:01.527 --> 15:04.321
Your home away from home
for the next 365 days.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.575
Completely self-sufficient, solar with
a generator backup, rain system,

15:09.576 --> 15:12.871
wild game is plentiful,
and there's a garden right there.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.581
Everything you need.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.583
What's that on the other side?

15:18.293 --> 15:19.836
[JD] That is East Tower.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.754
Contact with the other side
is strictly forbidden,

15:21.755 --> 15:25.091
which is irrelevant given the land mines
and lethal tactical barriers

15:25.092 --> 15:26.801
to the north and south of the Gorge.

15:26.802 --> 15:28.594
Can't get to the other side anyway.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.680
In practical terms,
East Tower is not an issue.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.724
They do their thing. You do yours.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.727
I did see movement over that side
earlier this morning.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.564
Think they just completed
their annual rotation too.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.982
- [sniffs]
- Theoretically, the job's simple.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.483
You're not the principal line of defense.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.486
You're more like
a highly skilled maintenance man.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.446
Every day, you walk the western rim.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.450
There are automatic Phalanx gun turrets
every 600 meters or so.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.660
You restock the ammo in the auto gun,

15:52.661 --> 15:55.955
check the containment fence,
cloakers and suspended mines.

15:55.956 --> 16:00.001
There's an armory in the bunker outside.
Weapons, tools, replacement ammo, mines.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.086
Whatever you need.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.881
Radio check every 30 days.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.882
What's a cloaker?

16:05.883 --> 16:08.134
[JD] Cloaker is a type of
satellite transmitter.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.261
There's one every kilometer or so
along the rim,

16:10.262 --> 16:14.182
each with its own power
and backup power source.

16:14.183 --> 16:16.393
- [Levi] What do they do?
- They cloak.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.353
They send a false signal
to all the satellites

16:19.354 --> 16:20.856
that pass overhead on a given day.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.442
They're designed to render the Gorge
invisible to spy satellites,

16:24.443 --> 16:26.278
but they also work with
shit like Google Earth.

16:27.362 --> 16:31.115
Ah. Um, there is no
outside communication here.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.910
No cell, no sat, no nothing.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.411
In case of an emergency,
there's a panic button

16:35.412 --> 16:38.581
on the dedicated shortwave radio
you use for monthly radio checks.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.541
Button triggers a signal,
which lets them know that--

16:40.542 --> 16:41.543
Let's who know?

16:42.211 --> 16:44.545
[stammers] The powers that be, mate.

16:44.546 --> 16:45.464
Whoever.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.509
Did you spy the old air-raid sirens
atop the tower?

16:49.259 --> 16:53.387
If, somehow, all the cloakers fail at once
or if the Gorge is ever overrun,

16:53.388 --> 16:57.099
their automated system executes
something called a Straydog protocol.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.768
Straydog protocol.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.145
- What is that?
- No idea.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.899
But if you hear those air-raid sirens,
you run like hell.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.275
Copy that.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.860
Look, here's the deal.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.154
This place is old.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.323
I'm talking end of the Second World War,
early Cold War shit.

17:12.324 --> 17:13.783
And it's secret.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.535
Way back then, an agreement was made,

17:15.536 --> 17:17.787
and a coalition formed
to keep it a secret.

17:17.788 --> 17:20.914
So, now, every year, a new representative
from one of the western nations

17:20.915 --> 17:24.418
patrols the western rim and someone
on the other side patrols the eastern rim.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.503
They're your counterpart.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.631
You're telling me
leaders from the East and West

17:28.632 --> 17:31.008
have been secretly working together
for the last 75 years?

17:31.009 --> 17:35.471
No. I'm telling you there have been
nine Soviet Russian heads of state

17:35.472 --> 17:38.183
and 13 US presidents
since the coalitions were formed.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.435
And not one of them
has known about the Gorge.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.020
Give that a spin.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.402
Potato vodka. The still is in the armory.

17:49.403 --> 17:50.487
[clears throat]

17:51.196 --> 17:52.029
That's good.

18:00.914 --> 18:01.998
[JD] Hmm.

So apart from keeping this place a secret,
what's the mission?

18:07.004 --> 18:08.671

from going in the Gorge?

18:08.672 --> 18:09.590
No.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.552
You need to stop what's in the Gorge
from coming out.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.974
A year ago, I was in your boots and my
predecessor gave me the exact same speech.

18:19.975 --> 18:21.435

18:22.769 --> 18:25.314
- That he's completely full of shit.
- Exactly.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.316
But trust me,
keep your eyes on the central Gorge walls.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.567

called them that a long time ago

18:59.389 --> 19:00.474
and the name stuck.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.726
What I can tell you is in the late 1940s,

19:03.727 --> 19:06.187
they sent three entire battalions,

19:06.188 --> 19:09.149
2,400 men on horseback,
into the Gorge to clean it out.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.360
Not a single man returned.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.780
After that, they shifted to
a purely containment strategy.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.034

JD, what do you think's
really going on here?

19:31.296 --> 19:35.300
Well, the theory I think summarizes
the situation most succinctly

19:36.677 --> 19:41.682
is the Gorge is the door to hell
and we're standing guard at the gate.

56:12.998 --> 56:14.249
He would say,

56:14.958 --> 56:17.960
"Because too much truth
puts sadness in your heart

56:17.961 --> 56:20.005
and madness in your mind."

56:20.923 --> 56:21.924
I don't know.

56:23.467 --> 56:25.802
In my experience,
it's hiding the truth that does that.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.013
And when did you learn that?

56:30.766 --> 56:32.142
First time I pulled the trigger.

56:34.019 --> 56:35.062
Will you tell me about it?

56:37.105 --> 56:38.106
[grunts]

56:39.399 --> 56:40.566
It was just outside of Belize,

56:40.567 --> 56:43.153
and I was on a fishing boat
two klicks away.

56:45.322 --> 56:48.784
I've had the same recurring
nightmare about it ever since.

56:50.369 --> 56:51.370
Who have you told this to?

56:53.455 --> 56:54.289
Just you.

56:56.500 --> 56:58.210
Why did you choose this profession?

57:00.838 --> 57:01.964
Um...

57:03.757 --> 57:06.635
Hunting was just a part of
my homeschooling growing up in Oregon,

57:07.261 --> 57:11.682
and my dad,
he was the best instructor I ever had.

57:13.141 --> 57:13.976
He loved it.

57:15.227 --> 57:16.311
He made me love it.

57:16.812 --> 57:17.938
Love what exactly?

57:19.314 --> 57:20.941
The art of the perfect shot.

57:24.611 --> 57:25.445
Yeah.

57:25.946 --> 57:26.947
Do you still love it?

57:27.447 --> 57:28.615
Not like I did.

57:30.450 --> 57:35.372
I can't compartmentalize
the way I used to.

57:36.748 --> 57:37.874
Oh.

57:37.875 --> 57:39.710
My father always heard my secrets.

57:40.836 --> 57:42.212
I didn't have to bury them.

57:46.383 --> 57:51.805
You bury enough secrets,
the graveyard runs out of room.

57:58.520 --> 58:01.190
You dragged your mattress up the stairs
and made your bed here.

58:02.399 --> 58:03.650
For tactical reasons.

58:04.401 --> 58:05.569
I did the same thing.

58:06.111 --> 58:07.112
[sighs]

58:20.709 --> 58:23.962
["Spitting Off the Edge
of the World" playing]

01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:03.644
[Levi sighs]

01:00:03.645 --> 01:00:05.063
Did you lie to me, Levi?

01:00:05.981 --> 01:00:07.191
About what?

01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:10.152
Being a terrible dancer.

01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:13.822
Maybe a little bit.

01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:11.088
[Drasa] There.

01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:13.882
Those three close together.

01:01:15.217 --> 01:01:16.593
Orion's Belt.

01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:18.428
I see it.

01:01:19.388 --> 01:01:22.266
He told me to look at the Hunter
on Valentine's Day

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.560
knowing that he had ended it.

01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:26.270
I'm sorry.

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:28.772
[sighs]

01:01:30.816 --> 01:01:34.278
What do you do
when the sadness overwhelms you?

01:01:36.822 --> 01:01:39.575
Sometimes I'll read a poem.

01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:44.121
Maybe try and write one.

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:46.373
You write poetry?

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:49.293
Almost every day.

01:01:50.711 --> 01:01:52.004
Seriously?

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.882
I even took a class.

01:01:55.757 --> 01:01:59.344
Wednesday nights, 4:00 to 7:00 p.m.,
at Mesa Community College.

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:03.515
Well, um, are you talented?

01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:05.516
No, I'm terrible.

01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:07.686
Oh, sure. Like you're a terrible dancer?

01:02:08.187 --> 01:02:09.479
Yeah.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.899
Will you write me a terrible poem?

01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:14.109
Maybe I already have.

01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:16.695
Recite it for me.

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:19.697
- Absolutely not.
- Oh, come on.

01:02:19.698 --> 01:02:21.365
[chuckles] No chance in hell.

01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:23.826
- [stammers] At least tell me the title?
- No.

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:25.620
Well, then I don't believe you.

01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:27.830
You haven't written
a terrible poem for me, have you?

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.207
I have.

01:02:29.208 --> 01:02:30.625
But I just started it.

01:02:30.626 --> 01:02:32.461
Then tell me the title.

01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:37.048
- It's a working title.
- Tell me the working title.

01:02:37.049 --> 01:02:38.300
[clears throat]

01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:50.229
It's that bad?

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:51.980
[Drasa] I love it.

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.607
[chuckles] Shit.

01:02:54.608 --> 01:02:55.859
[kisses] I love it.

01:02:56.485 --> 01:02:58.194
No, you have to tell me.

01:02:58.195 --> 01:03:00.071
- Come on. Please. Please.
- There's no-- [chuckles]

01:03:00.072 --> 01:03:01.657
That's not happening.

01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:06.786
Did you like the rabbit pie?

01:03:06.787 --> 01:03:07.871
No.

01:03:09.206 --> 01:03:11.041
I fucking loved the rabbit pie.

01:03:15.212 --> 01:03:16.547

01:06:31.825 --> 01:06:34.076
Don't touch it.
It's some kind of adhesive.

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:35.162
Okay.

01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:38.081
- [grunts]
- You came for me.

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:40.918
Like you wouldn't do the same.

01:06:42.544 --> 01:06:43.795
[grunts]

01:06:44.463 --> 01:06:46.590
- [Drasa] What is this place?
- [Levi] I don't know.

01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:49.258
Please tell me
you brought an auto ascender.

01:06:49.259 --> 01:06:50.469
Of course I did.

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:53.263
Let's head to the east wall
and find the cable.

- You good?
- Yeah.

01:08:15.095 --> 01:08:16.555
What do you think they wanted?

01:08:17.264 --> 01:08:21.435
Given how emaciated they are,
my guess is that to them we're food.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.769
One of them rode off.

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:25.314
Yeah, I saw that.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:31.277
No. [stammers]

01:08:31.278 --> 01:08:32.946
- What?
- The auto ascender.

01:08:34.531 --> 01:08:39.077
Must have fallen out in the river,
and it's 500 meters to the top.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.290
We're stuck here.

01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:50.671
We follow the river south.

01:08:51.423 --> 01:08:53.300
Has to drain out of the Gorge somewhere.

01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:56.845
It's a military uniform.

01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:02.308
Old military. First Airborne American.

01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:05.686
I saw British SAS
and a Soviet Spetsnaz back there.

01:09:05.687 --> 01:09:06.897
Postwar.

01:09:10.192 --> 01:09:12.694
All these uniforms are from the 1940s.

01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:17.115
Cavalry on horseback.

01:09:17.783 --> 01:09:19.660
They're the lost battalions.

01:09:20.953 --> 01:09:23.037
They should be long dead, Levi.

01:09:25.207 --> 01:09:26.500

01:10:24.016 --> 01:10:25.058
Yeah.

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:18.904
This damage looks seismic.

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:20.989

01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:14.645
They chose to do it themselves.

01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:18.607
What's worse than death?

01:13:19.358 --> 01:13:20.776

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:40.173
<i>Our strategic forethought
in choosing this isolated location</i>

01:20:40.174 --> 01:20:43.718
<i>is the only factor that may possibly save
the rest of humankind</i>

01:20:43.719 --> 01:20:45.971
<i>from the fate
that we have sealed for ourselves.</i>

01:20:47.514 --> 01:20:48.765
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:51.602
<i>May God have mercy on our souls.</i>

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.738
Sounds like we could be fine
if our exposure is limited to hours.

01:21:03.739 --> 01:21:06.325
Well, let's find a way out quick then.

01:21:07.534 --> 01:21:08.410
What?

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.954
Maybe a way out.

01:21:19.588 --> 01:21:21.507
That's not from the 1940s.

01:21:22.174 --> 01:21:23.217
Late 2000s.

01:21:24.718 --> 01:21:26.677
Why not just send in a bomber squadron?

01:21:26.678 --> 01:21:28.764
Erase this whole mess and call it a day.

01:21:30.891 --> 01:21:33.143
[Levi] "Darklake." Paramilitary.

01:21:34.102 --> 01:21:35.269
They haven't bombed the Gorge

01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:37.189
because they're still studying
what's in it.

01:21:38.899 --> 01:21:40.776
We're not working for the military.

01:21:45.322 --> 01:21:47.491
They used all this
to set up their research drones.

01:21:48.784 --> 01:21:52.621
Darklake is a huge corporation
specializing in genetic research.

01:21:54.706 --> 01:21:57.501
Their drones are collecting
hybrid DNA samples.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:00.128
They're building super soldiers.

01:22:01.046 --> 01:22:02.840
That's the mother of all secrets.

01:22:03.507 --> 01:22:06.175
Young soldiers and scientists
studied like suffering lab rats.

01:22:06.176 --> 01:22:08.678
Private defense contractors
have been researching

01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:11.265
genetic soldier enhancement for decades,

01:22:12.015 --> 01:22:14.059
and everything down here
is genetically brand-new.

01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:17.479
We're here to protect their secrets.

01:23:01.481 --> 01:23:04.067
[Levi] Before we head out,
I need to say something to you.

01:23:04.693 --> 01:23:06.068
Let me guess.

01:23:06.069 --> 01:23:07.195
It's your poem?

01:23:07.196 --> 01:23:10.073
[chuckles] No, it's not my poem.

01:23:10.574 --> 01:23:11.742
[sighs]

01:23:13.202 --> 01:23:16.954
If something happens,
and we don't make it out of here,

01:23:16.955 --> 01:23:19.833
and this is the way the world ends,
for us anyway,

01:23:21.418 --> 01:23:22.878
to me it was worth it

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.589
because I got to know you.

01:23:26.507 --> 01:23:27.883
It wasn't easy,

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:30.511
getting to know each other.

01:23:31.011 --> 01:23:32.012
No, it wasn't.

01:23:37.518 --> 01:23:41.313
- Mmm.
- [breathes deeply]

01:23:43.023 --> 01:23:44.274
You ready for this?

01:23:46.777 --> 01:23:48.237
We go strong.

01:23:55.953 --> 01:23:59.248
My gear pack. [stammers]
I left it here. It has all the ammo in it.

01:24:02.543 --> 01:24:03.919
[shrieking]

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:08.090
These things can think tactically.

01:24:23.397 --> 01:24:24.982
They're playing with us.

01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:27.526
They know we can't see a thing.

01:24:31.405 --> 01:24:32.948
Let's make it mutual.

01:25:22.956 --> 01:25:24.750
- [grunts]
- [grunts]

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:27.628

Drasa!

01:27:28.081 --> 01:27:31.126
[screams, panting]

01:27:32.669 --> 01:27:37.298
[in Lithuanian] I'm going to cut
what's left of your ugly face off.

01:27:37.299 --> 01:27:39.384
[sobs, panting]

01:27:49.895 --> 01:27:50.979
[sniffs]

01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:55.192
[Drasa grunting, straining]

01:28:02.282 --> 01:28:03.909

- [panting]

01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:27.534
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Yeah.

01:29:33.665 --> 01:29:35.292
"B. Shaw."

01:29:36.585 --> 01:29:37.669
Bradford.

01:29:40.756 --> 01:29:43.050
He was the first soldier
in the West Tower.

01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:46.345
He named the Hollow Men.

01:29:47.346 --> 01:29:49.056
[Drasa panting]

01:29:51.475 --> 01:29:52.309
Levi.

01:29:57.231 --> 01:29:58.315
Where are we?

01:30:07.449 --> 01:30:09.617
[Levi]
We're in a chemical missile facility.

01:30:09.618 --> 01:30:11.619
I came down a missile silo.

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.247
They're the only way out.

01:30:25.926 --> 01:30:29.179
The earthquake damaged the missiles,
and they started leaking.

01:30:32.057 --> 01:30:34.309
The contaminant is in the fog.

01:30:39.022 --> 01:30:40.983
[wheezing]

01:31:29.323 --> 01:31:30.866

01:33:46.293 --> 01:33:47.878
I know how we're getting out of here.

01:33:48.378 --> 01:33:50.505
These old jeeps have powerful winches.

01:33:50.506 --> 01:33:52.508
It'll work just like an auto ascender.

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:31.963
Head to the eastern wall.

01:34:31.964 --> 01:34:33.549
The zip line should be close.

01:34:36.593 --> 01:34:38.262
There. That's it.

01:34:52.025 --> 01:34:53.485

[grunting, gasps]

01:38:45.217 --> 01:38:46.760
[Drasa] It was so surreal down there.

01:38:48.929 --> 01:38:50.931
Like a waking nightmare.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.894
That's as close to hell
as I ever want to get.

01:38:58.272 --> 01:39:00.064
We'll need to quarantine.

01:39:00.065 --> 01:39:03.443
[sighs] Five days.

01:39:08.365 --> 01:39:09.783
What if we're infected?

01:39:12.578 --> 01:39:14.371
I'll do what's necessary.

01:39:19.835 --> 01:39:20.878
Same.

01:39:22.504 --> 01:39:24.339
I have radio check tomorrow.

01:39:25.132 --> 01:39:26.091
Same.

01:39:26.967 --> 01:39:29.553
I don't know how
I'm supposed to get back across.

01:39:30.053 --> 01:39:32.389
There's a C19 grappling gun in the back.

01:39:33.974 --> 01:39:35.184
That should do it.

01:39:36.059 --> 01:39:38.769
Well, I guess
the Russians stock a better armory.

01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:41.815
They also make better vodka.

01:39:42.733 --> 01:39:43.734
Here.

01:39:45.152 --> 01:39:47.237
To making it out alive.

01:39:52.242 --> 01:39:53.243
[sighs]

01:39:56.079 --> 01:39:58.248
Do you know why I even got this job?

01:39:58.790 --> 01:40:01.042
Because of that impossible shot
you made in Yemen?

01:40:01.043 --> 01:40:04.546
[chuckles] No, I wasn't lying about that.

01:40:05.297 --> 01:40:06.631
I didn't make that shot.

01:40:06.632 --> 01:40:07.841
I know.

01:40:08.342 --> 01:40:10.260
I know exactly who made that shot.

01:40:12.304 --> 01:40:13.262
[chuckles]

01:40:13.263 --> 01:40:14.598
Why did you get the job?

01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:19.436
They chose me because I was expendable.

01:40:20.312 --> 01:40:21.563
Expendable?

01:40:22.523 --> 01:40:23.774
No attachments.

01:40:24.274 --> 01:40:26.944
No one to miss me if I disappeared.

01:40:29.029 --> 01:40:31.365
Nothing to live for
except the next mission.

01:40:34.576 --> 01:40:36.328
But now it's all flipped.

01:40:38.205 --> 01:40:40.290
And I have everything to live for.

01:40:45.254 --> 01:40:46.380
We could run.

01:40:47.047 --> 01:40:50.467
I know a place in France,
and we could be safe there.

01:40:50.968 --> 01:40:52.427
For as long as we want.

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:58.599
Drasa, I want to leave with you
more than anything in the world.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.643
But what about this place?

01:41:00.644 --> 01:41:03.271
What about the next pair of soldiers
that they bring in here,

01:41:03.272 --> 01:41:06.817
and inherit their secrets, and their lies?

01:41:09.319 --> 01:41:11.697
And every Hollow Man is a contaminant.

01:41:12.406 --> 01:41:13.866
So if one of them gets out...

01:41:18.412 --> 01:41:20.247
We need to destroy the Gorge.

01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:31.757
Remember,
mutations will appear within five days.

01:41:31.758 --> 01:41:35.094
So, if we make it to day six,
we're in the clear.

01:41:35.095 --> 01:41:37.180
- But if not--
- If not, we're dead.

01:41:37.181 --> 01:41:40.058
But if we're clear, we meet up next week.

01:41:42.019 --> 01:41:43.020
We go strong.

01:41:43.604 --> 01:41:45.606
- Yes?
- Always.

01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:51.069
- Lis--
- Don't say good-bye.

01:41:52.571 --> 01:41:54.113
I don't want to hear you say that.

01:41:54.114 --> 01:41:55.656
I wasn't going to say good-bye.

01:41:55.657 --> 01:41:58.702
Okay. And what were you gonna say?

01:42:07.586 --> 01:42:08.879
That I love you.

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:18.012

Yes.

Our research drone computer system
was activated.

01:42:42.412 --> 01:42:44.248

01:42:52.965 --> 01:42:54.465

happens these days.

01:43:01.348 --> 01:43:03.350
I'm assuming the kind that pays well.

01:43:03.934 --> 01:43:06.561
Let's just say the primary aim
of our research

01:43:06.562 --> 01:43:09.522
is to make American ground forces
unbeatable

01:43:09.523 --> 01:43:12.567
<i>against any foreign army in the world.</i>

01:43:12.568 --> 01:43:16.113
I'm sure you can appreciate what
we could do with a military like that.

01:43:17.906 --> 01:43:19.116
Absolutely.

01:43:21.577 --> 01:43:27.541
Levi, have you noticed any movement
from your eastern counterpart?

01:43:31.670 --> 01:43:32.671
Negative.

01:43:33.297 --> 01:43:37.426
<i>Because if it wasn't you that activated
our computer system in the Gorge,</i>

01:43:38.010 --> 01:43:40.637
I have to assume
that it was your eastern counterpart.

01:43:42.347 --> 01:43:45.601
<i>There are, after all,
only the two of you there.</i>

01:43:48.228 --> 01:43:50.772
<i>You are to neutralize your counterpart.</i>

01:43:52.733 --> 01:43:54.151
<i>Immediately.</i>

01:43:55.152 --> 01:43:56.612
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:43:58.363 --> 01:43:59.906
Consider it done.

01:43:59.907 --> 01:44:03.243
<i>Copy that. Thank you, Levi.</i>

01:44:18.634 --> 01:44:20.135
[inhales deeply]

01:44:23.722 --> 01:44:27.808
Commander, Levi Kane is compromised.

01:44:27.809 --> 01:44:30.228
Gather your team.
We'll leave in the morning.

01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:32.146
[commander] <i>You're coming with us, ma'am?</i>

01:44:32.147 --> 01:44:33.732
He's my mistake.

01:44:34.608 --> 01:44:37.027
I'll kill him myself if I have to.

01:44:53.544 --> 01:44:54.878
[chuckles]

01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:40.424
[chuckles]

01:45:43.468 --> 01:45:44.803
[helicopter approaching]

01:46:00.235 --> 01:46:01.486
[distorted] Run!

01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:25.761
[panting]

01:46:28.013 --> 01:46:30.057
[panting]

01:46:34.686 --> 01:46:37.104
There's no sign of Levi Kane
anywhere in the tower

01:46:37.105 --> 01:46:39.148
or on the surrounding compound.

01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:40.859
What if he decided to run?

01:46:43.737 --> 01:46:45.196
Raise the quadcopters.

01:46:45.197 --> 01:46:47.406
There's no sign of the counterpart either.

01:46:47.407 --> 01:46:50.452
If Levi didn't keep his post,
why believe that he would have killed her?

01:46:52.454 --> 01:46:53.622
Split them up.

01:46:54.122 --> 01:46:56.667
Drone protocol, quadcopters, verification...

01:47:20.315 --> 01:47:21.817
[drone whirring]

01:47:31.785 --> 01:47:33.327
[panting]

01:47:33.328 --> 01:47:34.913
[drone whirring]

01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:49.511
[grunts]

01:48:33.639 --> 01:48:35.307
[straining]

01:49:20.686 --> 01:49:22.062
[sighs]

01:49:25.816 --> 01:49:27.734
Commander, what's that on the wall?

01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:59.433
"Three things cannot be long hidden:

01:50:00.225 --> 01:50:04.771
the sun, the moon and the truth.

01:50:06.273 --> 01:50:07.191
Buddha.

01:50:09.568 --> 01:50:11.028
Levi Kane."

01:50:22.164 --> 01:50:23.165
[grunts]

01:50:27.544 --> 01:50:29.546
[breathing deeply]

01:50:45.354 --> 01:50:46.772
What the hell was that?

01:51:08.585 --> 01:51:12.381
The cloakers. He's rigged the cloakers.

01:51:15.759 --> 01:51:17.134
The Gorge is exposed.

01:51:17.135 --> 01:51:19.221
[sirens wailing]

01:51:25.018 --> 01:51:26.435
[siren blaring]

01:51:26.436 --> 01:51:27.980
Straydog.

01:51:30.107 --> 01:51:31.483
We have two minutes.

01:51:34.194 --> 01:51:35.362
[siren blaring]

01:51:37.281 --> 01:51:39.408
[commander] Prepare for immediate takeoff.

01:51:39.908 --> 01:51:41.368
[panting]

01:51:43.829 --> 01:51:45.289
[panting]

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.884
Get us airborne. Now!

01:52:07.269 --> 01:52:09.188
- [panting]
- [watch beeps]

01:52:11.231 --> 01:52:13.233
[grunting]

01:52:17.821 --> 01:52:20.949
Forget altitude! We need distance!

01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:39.301
[breathes shakily]

01:52:43.555 --> 01:52:45.057
Fast!

01:52:46.558 --> 01:52:48.267
[alarm ringing]

01:52:48.268 --> 01:52:49.895
[beeping]

01:52:52.231 --> 01:52:53.649
[screaming]

01:52:58.278 --> 01:52:59.530
[grunting]

01:53:05.911 --> 01:53:07.287
[grunts]

01:56:16.268 --> 01:56:17.768
[speaks French]

01:56:17.769 --> 01:56:19.062
- [speaks French]
- [chuckles]

01:56:53.305 --> 01:56:54.680
Hello, Drasa.

01:56:54.681 --> 01:56:57.768
Hello, Levi. You're late.

01:56:58.727 --> 01:57:01.854
Sorry. I, uh, got injured at my old job.

01:57:01.855 --> 01:57:05.316
Well, if you're looking for a new one,
the kitchen's hiring.

01:57:05.317 --> 01:57:06.735
Got any special skills?

01:57:08.237 --> 01:57:09.487
I'm a pretty good shot.

01:57:09.488 --> 01:57:10.863
How good?

01:57:10.864 --> 01:57:12.824
Last one was 3,900 meters.

01:57:13.617 --> 01:57:15.410
Had to beat my record.

01:57:17.037 --> 01:57:18.497
I had to get back to you.
