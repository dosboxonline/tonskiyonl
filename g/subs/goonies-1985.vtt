16:56.306 --> 16:58.300
Yeah, this map is old news.

16:58.300 --> 17:02.971
Everybody went looking for that
when our parents were our age.

17:02.971 --> 17:06.974
Haven't you heard of that guy? What's his
name? The pirate guy. One-Eyed Willy.

17:06.974 --> 17:08.821
One-Eyed Willy.

17:09.185 --> 17:11.313
One-Eyed Willy!

17:11.313 --> 17:15.817
The most famous pirate in his time.
My dad told me all about him once.

17:15.817 --> 17:18.152
Dad'll do anything to put you to sleep.

17:18.779 --> 17:22.199
No! See, One-Eyed Willy stole a treasure once.

17:22.199 --> 17:26.453
- And it was full of rubies and emeralds...
- And diamonds?

17:26.453 --> 17:30.665
And diamonds. Then he loaded it onto his ship...

17:30.665 --> 17:33.001
...and sailed away into the sunset.

17:33.001 --> 17:35.671
Until the British king found out about it...

17:35.671 --> 17:39.341
...and sent out his whole armada to go after him.

17:39.341 --> 17:43.262
It took them a couple of
weeks to catch up with Willy.

17:43.262 --> 17:46.223
Then there was a whole big war...

17:46.223 --> 17:49.810
...between the armada and
Willy's ship, the Inferno.

17:49.810 --> 17:51.853
During the firefight, there were...

17:51.853 --> 17:54.856
...guns and cannons bursting here and there.

17:54.856 --> 17:59.528
Then Willy fled, because he knew
he'd get killed if he stayed around.

17:59.528 --> 18:01.947
And then he got into this cave...

18:01.947 --> 18:05.033
...and the British blew up the walls around him.

18:05.033 --> 18:07.869
He got caved in, and he's been there ever since.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.121
- Forever?
- Forever.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.162
And ever?

18:10.580 --> 18:11.956
Trapped.

18:12.499 --> 18:13.874
Wow.

18:14.209 --> 18:16.710
You sound as corny as Dad does.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.506
- My dad tells the truth. Know what he said?
- What?

18:19.506 --> 18:23.635
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch
were down there for 5 or 6 years.

18:23.635 --> 18:26.888
- They were digging tunnels and caves.
- Wow.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.057
- Setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

18:29.057 --> 18:32.728
Setting booby traps so anybody
who tried to get in would die.

18:32.728 --> 18:34.730
- Then he killed all his men.
- Wow.

18:34.730 --> 18:36.690
- Why?
- Why kill all of them?

18:36.690 --> 18:38.567
So they wouldn't get his treasure.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.527
Wait a minute.

18:40.527 --> 18:44.072
If he killed all his men, how did
the map and all story get out?

18:44.072 --> 18:48.702
My dad said one of the guys must
have gotten out with the map.

52:38.104 --> 52:41.274
In 3rd grade, I cheated on my history exam.

52:41.274 --> 52:45.111
In 4th grade, I stole my uncle's
toupee and glued it on my face...

52:45.111 --> 52:47.697
...when I played Moses
in my Hebrew school play.

52:47.697 --> 52:52.934
In 5th grade, I knocked my sister
down the stairs, and I blamed our dog.

52:53.870 --> 52:57.207
<font color=#FF551>STEF:</font> Wait, I can't see a thing.
What am I stepping on?

52:57.207 --> 52:58.458
Oh, brother.

52:58.458 --> 53:02.462
<font color=#FF551>MIKEY:</font> Look, a lantern. Somebody
must have been here before us.

53:02.462 --> 53:04.714
<font color=#FF551>- DATA:</font> Maybe they're still here.
- I hope not.

53:04.714 --> 53:06.215
Look at these cigarettes.

53:09.803 --> 53:11.261
<font color=#ff00ff>[ANDY WHIMPERING]</font>

53:11.429 --> 53:16.476
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down
my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.

53:16.476 --> 53:18.978
If I'd been smart, he'd still be looking.

53:18.978 --> 53:21.146
<font color=#FF551>- BRAND:</font> Listen to her.
<font color=#FF551>- DATA:</font> What's the matter with her?

53:21.481 --> 53:23.816
<font color=#FF551>- BRAND:</font> Andy, it's okay.
<font color=#FF551>- DATA:</font> Is she all right?

53:24.150 --> 53:27.027
<font color=#FF551>BRAND:</font>
Andy. Andy.

53:28.947 --> 53:32.784
I should've let him look at my body.
Don't I have a beautiful body?

53:32.784 --> 53:34.536
You've got a great body.

53:34.536 --> 53:38.581
How many years do I have before
I get fat? Before my hair falls out?

53:38.581 --> 53:40.708
Before I look like him?

53:40.708 --> 53:43.293
<font color=#ff00ff>[ANDY & STEF SCREAMING]</font>

53:44.712 --> 53:49.384
Then my mom sent me to a
summer camp for fat kids.

53:49.384 --> 53:52.929
Then, once during lunch,
I got nuts and I pigged out...

53:52.929 --> 53:54.663
...and they kicked me out!

53:58.017 --> 54:00.519
- Look at him.
- Don't touch it, guys.

54:02.188 --> 54:05.107
This is one of your tricks,
isn't it, One-Eyed Willy?

54:07.777 --> 54:12.031
You must be really hiding something
to go through all this trouble.

54:12.031 --> 54:15.493
- There's nothing to worry about.
- You don't understand!

54:15.493 --> 54:16.785
Don't be afraid.

54:19.873 --> 54:23.835
He's dead for sure. I think
he's Chester Copperpot.

54:23.835 --> 54:25.378
- Chester who?
- Who?

54:25.378 --> 54:28.840
Don't you remember from
the attic? The news article?

54:28.840 --> 54:31.451
The last guy to look for the rich stuff...

54:31.551 --> 54:34.721
...he went in,
but he never came back out.

54:34.721 --> 54:36.973
That was back in 1935.

54:36.973 --> 54:41.644
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out
and he was an expert, what about us?

54:41.644 --> 54:43.396
How will we get out?

54:43.396 --> 54:45.982
- Don't worry about it. Calm down.
- You sure?

54:45.982 --> 54:48.484
- I'm positive.
- How will we get out?

54:48.985 --> 54:50.904
We can't be sure it's him.

54:50.904 --> 54:52.155
I know it's him.

54:52.155 --> 54:55.240
I bet his ID is in his wallet.
Mouth, get his wallet.

54:57.827 --> 54:59.286
Lou Gehrig?

54:59.871 --> 55:03.040
- You get it, Mikey!
- Mikey, get it.

55:09.172 --> 55:11.507
It is Chester Copperpot.

55:12.592 --> 55:15.345
- Oh, God. Come on.
- You see? I told you.

55:15.345 --> 55:17.513
We're gonna get killed too.

55:17.972 --> 55:19.515
Hey, look at this.

55:19.891 --> 55:21.058

55:24.062 --> 55:27.272
- They're gonna kill us. We're dead.
- Where are you going?

55:27.857 --> 55:30.151
- I'm setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

55:30.151 --> 55:34.197
That's what I said. I'll set booby
traps in case anyone follows us...

55:34.197 --> 55:36.699
...like the Fratellis. We'll hear them coming.

55:36.699 --> 55:38.577
- Okay, hurry up.
- Good idea.

55:38.576 --> 55:41.037
- Where you going?
- To set booty traps.

55:41.037 --> 55:44.999
- You mean booby traps.
- That's what I said. Booby traps!

55:44.999 --> 55:46.875
God, these guys....

55:49.879 --> 55:54.968

of One-Eyed Willy or something.

Wait, listen. Sounds like
somebody's down there.

57:29.228 --> 57:30.563
Shut up and listen.

57:30.563 --> 57:32.856
- Maybe it's a way out.
- Maybe it's the Fratellis.

- Maybe one of Willy's booby traps.

I mixed up fake puke at home...

58:18.778 --> 58:23.616
...and I went to this movie theater,
hid the puke in my jacket...

58:23.616 --> 58:25.352
...climbed up to the balcony...

58:25.352 --> 58:29.329

on all the people in the audience. Then...

58:44.721 --> 58:47.014
Then this was horrible.

58:47.014 --> 58:51.769
All the people started getting sick
and throwing up on each other.

58:51.769 --> 58:54.981

I ain't gonna go first.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:51.754
- Go!
- Can't argue with that, Ma, all right.

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:53.588
Troy, throw the bucket down.

01:04:54.965 --> 01:04:58.052
Hey, you guys, I'm the
smallest. I wanna go first.

01:04:58.052 --> 01:05:02.890
Get out! I'm the oldest, so I
call the shots. Andy goes first.

01:05:11.148 --> 01:05:15.444
Don't you realize? He was a pro!
He never made it this far.

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:18.888
Look how far we've come.
We've got a chance.

01:05:18.906 --> 01:05:21.322
Chance at what, Mikey? Getting killed?

01:05:21.909 --> 01:05:26.613
Look, if we keep going, someone's
really gonna get hurt. Maybe dead.

01:05:27.206 --> 01:05:28.999
We gotta get the police.

01:05:28.999 --> 01:05:32.311
- Maybe Chunk already got the police.
- Maybe Chunk is dead.

01:05:32.311 --> 01:05:36.248
Don't say that. Never say that.
Goonies never say "die"!

01:05:37.716 --> 01:05:41.302
I'm not a Goonie. I wanna go home.

01:05:59.029 --> 01:06:01.990
...it'll be in some other school.

the bestest stuff for us.

01:06:08.414 --> 01:06:11.000

do what's right for them.

01:45:25.769 --> 01:45:28.770
There's 50 houses to tear down after yours!

01:45:28.813 --> 01:45:30.606
- MR. WALSH: Ease off, Brand.
<font color=#FF551>- BRAND:</font> Punk!

01:45:32.275 --> 01:45:34.276
Sheriff, I want you to witness this.

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:36.737
Sorry, Dad.

01:45:37.155 --> 01:45:39.574
We had our hands on the future.

01:45:39.574 --> 01:45:42.494
But we blew it to save our own lives.

01:45:42.494 --> 01:45:43.744
Sorry.

01:45:44.621 --> 01:45:48.207
That's all right. You and Brand are
home safe with your mom and me.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.002
That makes us the richest people in Astoria.

01:45:53.964 --> 01:45:55.297
<font color=#FF551>PERKINS:</font>
Walsh...

01:45:55.966 --> 01:46:00.118
...you're looking at the richest
people in Astoria. Now sign it.

01:46:09.688 --> 01:46:11.981
I'm sure gonna miss being a Goonie.

01:46:14.651 --> 01:46:15.734

01:46:23.493 --> 01:46:25.519
What's she saying, Mouth?

01:46:29.165 --> 01:46:31.126
- No pen.
<font color=#FF551>- DATA:</font> No pen?

01:46:31.126 --> 01:46:32.501
No write.

01:46:34.337 --> 01:46:35.713
No sign!

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.132
Don't sign!

01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:46.515
<font color=#FF551>- BRAND:</font> What's in the bag?
<font color=#FF551>- DATA:</font> What is it?

01:46:57.068 --> 01:47:01.072
Dad! It's my marble bag!
The Fratellis forgot to check it.

01:47:01.072 --> 01:47:05.910
I put the jewels in it. We don't
have to leave the Goon Docks!

01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:11.082
There'll be no more signing today or ever again!

01:47:11.082 --> 01:47:12.875
<font color=#ff00ff>[ALL CHEERING]</font>

01:47:13.793 --> 01:47:16.338
Are those jewels real? How'd you find them?

01:47:16.338 --> 01:47:18.048
What happend out there?
Were your lives in danger?

01:47:18.048 --> 01:47:20.925
- The octopus was scary.
- Octopus?

01:47:20.925 --> 01:47:23.887
- It was dangerous.
- Walking the plank was scariest.

01:47:23.887 --> 01:47:25.263
Walking the plank?

01:47:25.263 --> 01:47:29.017
- Then we found the pirate ship.
- That and the pirate's treasure.

01:47:29.017 --> 01:47:32.062
- We were chased by the Fratellis.
<font color=#FF551>- SHERIFF:</font> That's enough.

01:47:32.062 --> 01:47:35.607
- Telling more stories, Lawrence?
<font color=#FF551>- CHUNK:</font> No, this time it's for real.

01:47:35.607 --> 01:47:37.693
How do you think we got the gold?

01:47:38.693 --> 01:47:41.278
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:47:41.946 --> 01:47:44.614
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.

01:47:53.583 --> 01:47:55.960
Ladies and gentlemen, we're at Cauldron Point...

01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:58.754
...and what appears to be a pirate ship....

01:48:18.108 --> 01:48:19.483
Bye, Willy.

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:22.236
