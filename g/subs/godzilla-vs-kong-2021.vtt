WEBVTT

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
She's waiting for me

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Mm.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
to let my love pass

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Alert, biodome breach.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Alert, biodome breach.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Dr. Andrews, did you see that?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
The habitat's not gonna
hold much longer.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
We need to start thinking
about off-site solutions.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
The island is the one thing
that's kept him isolated.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
If he leaves,
Godzilla will come for him.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
There can't be
two alpha Titans.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
The whole theory
of an ancient rivalry

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
stems from Iwi mythology.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
He's gotten too big over time.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
This environment
won't sustain much longer.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
It's too unstable.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Hey.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Off-site would be
a death sentence.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
You don't think the King
could take care of himself?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
There has to be another way.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Finding the origin
of these creatures

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
is essential
to mankind's survival.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
The interior
of the Earth

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
is made up of vast cabins
and air pockets,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
joined by natural avenues.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
The admiral
begins his expedition,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
searching for an entrance
to a hidden world.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
The purpose
is the discovery

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
and the release to the world

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
of the unknown treasures
of Antarctica

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
in the interests
of all mankind.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Members of the lost
party were never seen again.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Still no word
on what may have happened.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
There's an ecosystem
out there,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
the likes of which
we can't imagine.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
And the place to find it
is this island.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Hello, loyal listeners.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Welcome to  TTP,
Titan Truth Podcast.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Episode number 245.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Today is the day.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Maybe the last podcast
I ever record.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
And look, I know
I said that last week

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
and maybe the week before
and a few other times.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
But, look, this is the point.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
After five years of deep cover
at Apex Cybernetics,

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I'm finally taking my shot.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Something bad
is going on here.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I don't know what it is,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
but I'm about to walk in
and download hard evidence

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
and expose
a vast corporate conspiracy.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah, you can call me
a whistleblower,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
but I ain't just whistling.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I mean, this is more
than a leak. It's a flood.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And believe me, this flood

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
is gonna wash away
all of Apex's lies.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
You can believe that.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Welcome to Apex Cybernetics.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
No unauthorized persons
allowed beyond this point.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
When we started
Apex Cybernetics,

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
we dreamt of new ways

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
to push past the limits
of human potential.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Robotics, the human mind,
artificial intelligence.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Who knows what brave new
future we'll dream of next?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm Walter Simmons,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and it is my privilege
to lead Apex

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
into humanity's bold new era.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
We're not going anywhere.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
And neither are you.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
There you are, baby.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
No, don't eat that!

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It's incredibly unhealthy.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
It's just all the GMOs.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Growing a second head
could be useful.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
You have to let me know.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Because me, myself?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I can barely handle
the one I got.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Bernie, you're not
supposed to be in here.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
You ever wonder
what we're really doing here?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I mean, really doing here.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Why are you here?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
This isn't Engineering.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Because, you know,
I had to wait

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
because they're rendering
these new specs,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
which is gonna
take over, uh...

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
That's calculator mode.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
...over one hour,
maybe even more.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
So my foreman told me
to just take a walk

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
-and make some new friends.
-Oh.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Oh! Now that
we're new friends,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I can share something
with you, right?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I know it's in here somewhere.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
This is hand sanitizer that
I made from my own garden.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
It's really amazing.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Don't know
if I used that or not.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Yes. This. Check this out.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
That right there
is radio mesh networking

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
with a voice-record
subprocessor.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
-Guess from where. Come on.
-I don't care.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
It's from a toaster.
Look at this thing.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I have to go to the bathroom.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Is it one or two?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
'Cause if it's two, it's
probably from these apples.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Hey, you wanna use the
hand sanitizer that I made?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm good.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay, I'll just stay here.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Okay. Yeah.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Ah, let's see.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Whoo.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Screen.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
What are they shipping
to Hong Kong?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
What's Sublevel 33?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
What the...?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
-

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Evacuation, Titan alert.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
This is not a drill.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
All Apex employees,
please proceed...

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
That is my cue. That's my cue.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
This is not a drill.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Proceed to the fallout shelter
in a single-file line.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Let's go!

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
They used
cyanide capsules

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
instead of fallout shelters
to keep the secrets in,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
but, you know,
that's neither here nor there,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
so don't listen to me.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Level two personnel,
this way! Let's go, let's go!

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah, that way.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
It's time!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
We need to go now!

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Evacuate.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
One level at a time, okay.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
-No.
-Hey, you!

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
-Where's your clearance tag?
-You know what?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
The fact that
you're talking about

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
clearance tags right now
in a time of crisis

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
is incredibly unprofessional.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
We should be talking
about evacuation.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
-Yo! Okay!

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
-

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
-

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Oh, my God.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Oh, no. What the hell is that?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
This is CNN breaking news.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
The United States
Navy's Fourth Fleet

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
is deployed off
the southeastern seaboard

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
of the U.S. after last night's
sudden Godzilla attack.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
A time of
relative peace shattered

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
when the massive Titan,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
once thought to be
a hero to humanity,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
made landfall
in Pensacola, Florida.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
While the damage
was largely contained

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
to the U.S. headquarters
of Apex Cybernetics,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
governments around the world
aren't taking any chances

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
after the first substantiated
Titan sighting

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
in over three years.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
CEO Walter Simmons
had this to say.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
It's about working together
to ensure a safer world.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Godzilla's a threat
to humanity,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
and Apex has a plan
to deal with it,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
-once and for all.
-

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Students and faculty,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
a mandatory assembly
will be held

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Guidance counselors
will also be holding

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
additional office hours
all this week

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
for individual
and group sessions.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Welcome back, loyal listeners,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
to  Titan Truth Podcast,
episode 246.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Oh, my God. I was there.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Godzilla's Apex attack.
I saw it go down!

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
You think it's a coincidence
that he reappears

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
and just so happens to destroy
that specific facility?

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Ha-ha, no, no, no, no.
No such thing as coincidence.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Dad, I'm telling you,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
provoking him
that we're not seeing here.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
if there wasn't
another Titan around?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
That podcast is filling
your head with garbage.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
-You should be in school.
-I am just trying to help.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I don't have any more.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
How could you doubt him?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
-There has to be a pattern.
-There doesn't.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
-A reason why he was provoked.
-There isn't.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
How do you know that?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Because creatures,
like people, can change.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
And right now,
Godzilla's out there

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
So cut your pop some slack,
would ya?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
See you at home, Dad.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
You wanna know
my theory?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I mean, of course you do.
That's why you're here.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Come on, it's all about
patterns and variables.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Oh, wait, stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
to sixth grade with this,
okay?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Godzilla attacks when
provoked, that's the pattern.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Pensacola is
the only coastal Apex hub

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
with an advanced robotics lab.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
That's the variable.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And add them up
and your answer is

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
-

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Can I help you?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
If you want an appointment,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
my office hours
are nine to five.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Please, Dr. Lind.
-What the f...

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Guys like you and me,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
we don't do normal hours,
do we?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I've been fixated
on Hollow Earth

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
for as long as you have.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
is fascinating.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Your book was very impressive.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
about 30 unsold boxes

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
in my apartment
if you want some.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Walt Simmons.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
I know who you are, sir.
It's an honor.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
These are dangerous times,
Dr. Lind.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Allow me to introduce

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
our Apex chief technology
officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
He has an interesting thing
to show you.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
You know what this is, right?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Hollow Earth.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
An ecosystem
as vast as any ocean,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
right beneath our feet.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
This energy signal
is enormous.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
And almost identical
to readings from  Gojira.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
As our sun
fuels the planet's surface,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth,

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
If we can harness
this life force,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
I need your help to find it.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Did you read the reviews?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Look where they put my office.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Besides, I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
We tried.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I'm sorry about your brother.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
He was a true pioneer.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Thanks.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
See, all of our forward scans

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
suggest a habitable
environment down there.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
When they tried to enter,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
they hit
a gravitational inversion.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
A whole planet's worth
of gravity

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
reversed in a split second.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
They were crushed
in an instant.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
What if I told you
that we, at Apex,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
have created
a phenomenal craft

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
which could sustain
such an inversion?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicle.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
HEAV.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
We can make the journey

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
to Hollow Earth possible,
Dr. Lind.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
But we need you
to lead the mission.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Help me.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Help everyone.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Finding this needle
in a haystack

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
is our best shot
against Godzilla.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Well, I, uh,
might have an idea.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
But it's crazy.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
to return
to their evolutionary source.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Like spawning salmon.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
So if this is the Titans' home

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
and this life force
sustains them...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
A Titan
could show you the way.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Yeah.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
With a little help
of an old colleague.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Ugh, where is it?

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Dr. Andrews,
you have a visitor

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Okay.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
A power source
in Hollow Earth?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
This sounds nuts, Nathan,
even for you.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
It's there! We just
need Kong to bring us to it!

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
The second you take
Kong out of containment,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
You said you can't
keep him here forever.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
No. Our meddling
has already wreaked havoc

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
on Kong's habitat.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
No way am I
letting you drag him

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
No, not as a weapon.
As an ally.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
To protect us,
lead the way down there.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
What even makes you think
that he'll go in?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
You always believed
that Skull Island

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
was like Hollow Earth
come to the surface, right?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
And that's where Kong's
ancestors came from.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Mm-hmm.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Through the entrance
in Antarctica,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
we could help him
find a new home.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
And he could save ours.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Hers.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
That power source
may be our only hope.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
We gotta stop Godzilla.
This is our only chance.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
We have to take it.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
-Okay.
-Yes!

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
But when it comes to Kong,
what I say goes.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You name the terms. Thank you.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Sorry. Thank you.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
You won't regret this.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
-Mm, I already regret this.
-

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Come on.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
that he'd rather roam

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
he'd rather be alone

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
see me now

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
in the wind

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
that I can

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
and longing for

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
Whoo! Jeez,
I can smell him from up here.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Well, he can smell you, too.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Still not a fan, huh?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
What's she saying?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Just an Iwi expression.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
It means
that you're very brave.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
-Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Hey, use a light touch
on the sedatives.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
He's our escort.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
We can't have him comatose
when we reach Hollow Earth.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
What if Kong
doesn't go willingly?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
-What do you do then?
-

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Dr. Lind, please report

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
to the forward deck. Dr. Lind.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Excuse me.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
New arrivals.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
-

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Welcome.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
Wow. Who's the idiot
who came up with this idea?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
-Ha-ha.
-I'm Maia Simmons.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
My father sent me.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I run point for Apex.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Nathan Lind, mission chief.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm just here to babysit.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
-

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicles

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
are on their way to Antarctica
as we speak.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
I know you people
think you're cutting-edge,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
but these prototypes
we're loaning you

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
will make what you've been
flying look like used Miatas.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I love Miatas.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Forget about the price tag,
which is obscene, of course.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
The antigravity engines
alone produce

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
enough charge
to light up Vegas for a week.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Feel free to be impressed.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Wow.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
All right, we'll be

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
at the Antarctica entry
in 48 hours.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
This path will get us
into Hollow Earth.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Once we're inside, Kong should
lead us to the power source.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Now, the gravitational
inversion

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
will be quite intense.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Our best guess
is that on entry,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
it'll feel like
bungee jumping...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
with the cord tied
to your lower intestine.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
But if your helicopters
are as good as you say...

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
HEAVs.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
If your HEAVs are as good
as you say they are,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
I believe we can do this.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
They'll do the job.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
You just gotta do yours.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Excellent.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Dr. Andrews.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
We've avoided
all of Godzilla's

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
according to your guidelines.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Good.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Do I need to be concerned?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Yes. They do have a way
of sensing threats.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
And we believe that they had
an ancient rivalry.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
The myths say
that their ancestors

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
fought each other
in a great war.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
So if they meet again,
who bows to who, is that it?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
No, I spent 10 years
on that island studying him.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I know this for sure.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Kong bows to no one.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Is she supposed
to be out there?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
-

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Jia, come on. Come on.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Did the monkey just talk?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Okay, class, listen up.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
In the midst of Godzilla's
attack on Apex Pensacola,

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
I found some crazy tech with
no official classification.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
What I saw doesn't match

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
any of the engineering specs
I've ever seen.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
So what are they working on
in such blackout secrecy, hmm?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
This could be the thread
that finally unravels

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
the Apex sweater
of conspiracy.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
You better believe
I'm gonna keep tugging.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
For now, I'm secure.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Anonymous
and hiding in plain sight

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
as I continue my mission.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Breaking the law

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Breaking the law

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
To be clear, my brother can
never know we took his van.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Josh, to be clear, even if
we got into an accident,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I don't think he could tell.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
No, no, my brother would never
let you drive either.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
My mission, my wheel.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
I just don't think
it's a good idea,

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
looking for some secret weirdo
off the Internet.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
I mean, we just had
an assembly about this.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
He's not a weirdo.
He's a covert investigator.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And he's the only one
looking for the truth

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
about Godzilla and Apex.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
So let him look.
Why do we have to help him?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Because...

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
If we don't, nobody else will.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Are you coming or not?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Obviously I'm coming.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
It's stuck.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Mind control.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Psionic link technology
is a reality.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
That's right.
One brain controlling another.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Oh, man.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Imagine that
on a global scale

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
and Apex is invincible.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
We've been listening
to this weirdo for hours.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Whoa! Knock it off!

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Wait, this is the part
I was telling you about.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
...need special UV to
even know you've been marked!

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
One or two gallons
won't cut it.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
I need my bleach in bulk!

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Because spy dust
is real, people!

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I mean, come on,
invisible to the naked eye...

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
-That's how we find him.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
-The bleach.
-Bleach?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
He consumes a ton of bleach.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
He drinks bleach?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Showers with it.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Oh! Yeah, I shower
with bleach. No, what?

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
See? Tradecraft.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Come on,
just one more place.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Madison, this is getting old.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Hey, you sell bleach?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
I didn't know
they were gonna eat them.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Look, we're looking for a guy

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
who works
for Apex Cybernetics.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
He's probably paranoid,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
high-strung,
doesn't like daylight.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
You know, has a lot of crumbs
in his beard,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
if he has a beard.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Okay, look,
you kids want some candy?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Because I can help you
with candy.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah, we want lots of candy.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
What are you doing?
You think...?

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
Oh, you mean Bernie.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah, I know that guy.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
He buys,
like, a ton of bleach.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I know where he is, too.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Bernie?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Mister...
Mis...

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
-

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Mister Bernie not home.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Yep, that was
definitely Mister Bernie.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah. Um...

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
No. No. No.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
For knocking on a door?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
No. No.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Bernie, you don't trust
the authorities.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
My name is Madison Russell.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Emma Russell, right?

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
Before we go any farther,
I got one question.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Tap or no tap?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
No tap.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
-Excuse me, what is "tap"?
-Water.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Oh, I drink tap water.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
But she does the thinking
for both of you,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
so it should be all right.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
-Thanks.
-Okay.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
What you got?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
haven't just been random.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I'm of the same opinion.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
trying to figure out
what their game was.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Then, last week...

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I saw this.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong,

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
which makes no sense

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
-Then what?
-And then boom!

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Godzilla shows up.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Caved in half the facility,

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I mean, some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah, but what is that?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
That's, um...

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Yeah, but it's
in a gun holster.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It was a gift from my Sara.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
You have a Sara?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
She was my wife.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Um, she passed on.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
She was my rock.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
My truth.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
that's the day
you know I've given up.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Bernie.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
I think we can
help each other.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Okay, I guess
now that we're a team,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
We're breaking into Apex.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Wait, what?
- You heard her.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Tap water.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Shit.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Hey.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Thank you.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
How is she?

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Calm. So calm, it's scary.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
That was extraordinary.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I thought that he showed
recognition, but he never...

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
No.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I knew that they had a bond.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
He trusts her.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Without her, he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
You know, Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
When the storm
took over the island,

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
it wiped out
the native people.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
But Kong saved her.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
She had nowhere to go.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
So I made a promise,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
then and there,
to protect her.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
No.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah, no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
And she's a child.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
I know
Jia is only a child.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
And we need Kong
to find that power source.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
The world needs him.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
What's she saying?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Godzilla.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
-

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Did we change course?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
He's not coming for us.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
How about we throw you off
instead, huh?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
We have to release him.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
If we lose Kong,
the mission is over.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
He's a sitting duck out there.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Oh, my God, Jia!

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Nathan?

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
He needs our help.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
There must be some way
to disorient Godzilla.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Depth charges.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
He's circling back.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
This won't end
until one of them submits.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Shut it down.
-What?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
All of it.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Guns, engines.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
-Shut it down. Right now.
-If we do that, we're dead.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
No, we're playing dead.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
And we're making him think
that he's won.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Cut the power.
Cut the engines.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Kill anything
that makes a noise.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
This better work.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
As soon as we move,
he'll be back.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
How's Kong with heights?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
So, what's the plan?

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
We find out
what's on Sublevel 33.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
- Ow.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Keep it moving, tap water.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Go ahead.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
All right, Mad Hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Okay. We got this.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Oh, my God!

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Are you sure
we can trust this guy?

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Yeah, why?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
and carries
a bottle of whiskey

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
from his dead wife like a gun.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
I think it's romantic.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Whoo-hoo!

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
I really don't
understand women.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Okay, come on.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
-

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
This whole thing came
down, and there was this...

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
eye.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Uh, what are
we looking at?

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
No, no, no, no.
No, it was here.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
I swear to God, it was...
it was right there.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Hey, guys.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
-

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Anyone know
where this leads to?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
You believe me, right?

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
'Cause I know that
there was something here.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
I'm gonna get a migraine
from that torch.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
"Sublevel." How deep
does this thing go, Bernie?

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
Hell. Goes to hell.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Sublevel 33.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Maglev shuttle departure

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
to Roswell, New Mexico
at 0900 hours.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
What is all this?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
It's breakaway civilization.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
I mean, come on.
This is page one

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
in the Apex-playing-God
handbook. Huh?

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
I mean, the Illuminati
running shadow economies

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
all to fund a hidden colony
for the elite

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
in case any
of these governments

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
and megacorporations

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
accidentally hit
the doomsday button.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
It makes sense

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
-if you think about it.
-Yeah, sure.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Someone's coming.
-What?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
-Someone's coming.
-What?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Someone's coming?
- Yes!

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Oh, my God.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
They look like eggs.
-Skull-crawlers.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
What's Apex doing
with skull-crawlers?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
All right,
let's load it up!

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
-

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
What was that?
What was that?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
-No way. No, no, no. Come on.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Okay, guys,
I think we're moving.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
It says we're headed

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
-What?
- Hong Kong.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
That means that we're gonna
get some answers.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
G10, clear for launch.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Here we go.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
We're getting close!

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
-

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
It's not working.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
What if she tells him

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
there are others
down there like him?

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
But you don't know that.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
We lost our entire fleet
getting here.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
There's no way back for him.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
And he can't survive here.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
All right. All right.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
Hey.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
He's going. Prepare to launch!
Everybody to their station.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
We gotta go.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
All flights crews cleared

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
for immediate HEAV launch.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
HEAV 1 online.
We're clear for launch.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Copy that, HEAV 1.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
HEAV 2 online.
Exiting hangar now.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
HEAV 2,
confirmation 4055.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
This is HEAV 3
online, launching now.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
We'll follow him from behind.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
There.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
There he is.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Are you sure the monkey's
gonna survive this?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
Oh, he'll be fine.
It's us I'd worry about.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
We're about to be launched
1,000 miles in two seconds

56:39.000 --> 56:44.000
until gravity inverts itself
and spits us into free fall.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
It'll be the most amazing
thing you've ever seen.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Here. For the vomit.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
What?

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Engine failure, gravity low.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
-Engine failure.
-

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
All Delta, reverse gravity
propulsion!

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
It's beautiful.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
This is HEAV 3,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
we're getting some
strange radar activity.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
We're gonna circle back and...

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000
All Delta, prepare to attack!

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000
That's gross.

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:24.000
Kong's on the move.

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:25.000
We gotta go.

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.000
Well, he seems to know

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000
Oh, he certainly can move.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000
Okay, okay.

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000
Creepy monorail
is slowing down.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.000
Attention:
Shipping pod arriving.

1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000
Okay. Keep quiet.
Follow me.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.000
We're going in?

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.000
Yeah.

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:57.000
Oh, no!

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:01.000
Every time, I swear.
Doors hate us.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000
Oh, yeah.

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000
Aah!
- Oh, my God!

1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:16.000
It's just so massive.
It's so stupid.

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000
So, what is this place?

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000
Well, if there's
a corporate-friendly term

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000
I'd say we are in it.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000
Oh, God, that stinks.

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000
That's not good. Bernie!

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.000
I really hate this place.

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000
Attention: Demonstration

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000
in T-minus one minute.

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000
All personnel
are to stay clear of the area.

1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.000
Mr. Simmons,
systems are coming online now.

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000
Commence uplink.

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:31.000
Engaging uplink.

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000
Pilot engaged.

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000
That's robot Godzilla.

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000
Oh, no. That's...

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:11.000
That's Mechagodzilla.

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000
Release number 10.

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000
Go, go!
Go through there!

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000
Madison! Run, girl!

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000
-

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:19.000
Yes!

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:30.000
-

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.000
System only reached 40% power.

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:35.000
Oh, I know.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:37.000
As expected.

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000
Don't worry.
Once the Hollow Earth

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000
sample is uploaded,

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000
our power troubles
will be over.

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000
If they can find
the source.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:48.000
Oh, they'll find it.
I have faith in my daughter.

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000
I have faith in our creation.

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000
And humanity
will once again...

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:57.000
be the apex species.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.000
This is why Godzilla attacked
the Apex facility.

1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:04.000
They're trying
to replace him.

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000
Come on, Maddie.

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000
Sir,
Godzilla just made

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:37.000
in direction.
He's moving very fast.

1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000
Projections show he's likely
headed to Hong Kong.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.000
Transport is ready and waiting
to take you there, sir.

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.000
That has to be it.

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000
We were right.

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000
He's home.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000
All personnel must display

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000
their Apex employee badge
at all times.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000
Follow me.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000
Lizard people
build all their facilities

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000
the same way.
I can find the exit.

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000
The exit's this way.

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000
Guys. Madison!

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000
Oh, my God.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000
Bitch, what?

1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:08.000
It's a Titan skull.

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.000
No, no, no.
That's not just any Titan.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.000
That's Monster Zero.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:16.000
Ghidorah.

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000
They hardwired its DNA.

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000
Self-generating
neural pathways

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000
capable of intuitive learning.

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000
Okay, I'm smart,
but I only go to high school.

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000
-It's a living supercomputer.
- Shh.

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000
It had three heads.

1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000
Its necks were so long,

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000
they communicated
telepathically.

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:41.000
And there's one here

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000
and another one
inside of that thing.

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:46.000
Yeah, it could be
a psionic interface.

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000
Oh, my God.

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000
Careful.

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000
It's a pilot.

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.000
Yeah.
He's in a trance.

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:57.000
That's a psionic uplink.

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000
It follows his will.

1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000
Oh, Apex, what have you done?

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:27.000
-

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000
This is the day we feared.
I've given the order, Doctor.

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000
-The city is being evacuated.

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:03.000
I don't understand.
He led us here. Where is it?

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000
What is he doing?

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000
It's the axe.

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000
It's drawing radiation
from the core

1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000
like it's charging.

1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:44.000
Whoa! Godzilla's
responding! They found it!

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.000
What in the hell?

1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000
What are you doing?

1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000
Extracting a sample.

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000
This is a power
beyond our understanding.

1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000
You can't just drill into it.

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000
Actually, we can.

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000
My father gets what he wants.

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000
That's Apex property now.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:21.000
What?

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:29.000
Energy signature incoming.

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:32.000
We should be able
to recreate it soon.

1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000
That is the discovery
of the millennium.

1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.000
-You can't strip it for parts.
-Hold it.

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000
Go. Go. Got what we needed.

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:09.000
Let's go!

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.000
Yes.

1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:16.000
Mr. Serizawa,
start your engines!

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:17.000
The upgrade is untested.

1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.000
Once we get online,

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000
Gojira  will come
straight for us.

1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:22.000
He's been coming for us

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000
since our creation
first awoke.

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.000
-We must embrace it.
-We shouldn't rush this.

1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000
We have no idea
how this energy source

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.000
will affect the Mecha.

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000
Get in the goddamn chair.

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:50.000
Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000
Move! What are you
waiting for? Let's go!

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.000
This way, sir! Hurry!
We gotta get back...

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.000
-

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000
Okay.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000
-

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:08.000
Get him out of the way!
Shoot him!

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:12.000
-Go, go, go!
-

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:20.000
-

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:22.000
Oh, no.

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:24.000
No, no, no...

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:30.000
Oh, Jesus!
Come on, let's go!

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000
-Hold on, ladies.
-Yeah.

1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000
Whoa.

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.000
Stay low.

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000
Yeah. Going viral.

1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:38.000
What?

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.000
We've gotta try and stop this.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000
Mm-mm. I don't like this, guys.

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000
If this wasn't contributing
to world destruction,

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000
this would be
a great DJ booth.

1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:54.000
I know what it... Maintenance.

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000
-Madison, we should go.

1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:57.000
I'm Maintenance.
You don't have to alert the...

1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.000
She doesn't buy that.
Uh, Madison, we need to go.

1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000
The woman
with the villain hairdo...

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000
Madison, they have guns.

1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000
Hey, guys. Uh, it's soundproof
so I can't really...

1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000
-I wanna communicate...
-Open the door!

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:09.000
Say again?

1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000
Oh, God!
Get down! Get down!

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000
Oh, shit!

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:07.000
-

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000
We're about to breach
the veil! Hold on!

1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000
-

1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.000
Looks like round two
goes to Kong.

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.000
Hey!

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:26.000
Oh, come on, guys.
Really? Greenpeace again?

1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000
Greenpea...

1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000
Actually, sir, not like
you would know this,

1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000
but I'm Level Two
Assistant Engineering...

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:35.000
Well, Provisional Level Two
Assistant Engineering,

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000
not like you would know that.

1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000
My evaluations
were incredibly encourag...

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.000
I'm just saying Greenpeace
wishes, is all I'm saying.

1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000
Where do I know you from?

1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000
Oh, my goodness.

1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:54.000
Director Russell's daughter,
yes?

1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000
You caused all of this.

1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:00.000
If by "all of this,"
you mean I, and I alone,

1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:03.000
have given humanity a chance
against the Titans,

1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000
then, yes,
I will own that title.

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000
Godzilla had left us in peace.

1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000
You provoked him into war.

1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.000
There can only be one alpha,
Miss Russell.

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000
It seems to have been
providence.

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:07.000
It's time to launch.

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:10.000
Begin pilot integration.

1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.000
And now...

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:21.000
my Mecha.

1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:25.000
It's not only
Godzilla's equal...

1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.000
but his superior.

1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:34.000
The Apex Titan of my own hand.

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:39.000
It's time to show
the world what you can do.

1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.000
Pilot engaged.

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:50.000
Alert: Failure.
System unstable.

1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:54.000
Alert: Failure.
System unstable.

1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:00.000
This is how we,
as a species, win.

1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:03.000
You see, 10 years ago,

1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:07.000
when  Gojira  was first revealed
to the world,

1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:09.000
I had a dream.

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:12.000
And in that dream,
I saw one thing.

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:18.000
And that beautiful,
amazing thing was...

1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:22.000
Oh, shit.

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:23.000
No!

1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:41.000
I really wanted to hear
the rest of that speech.

1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:19.000
What in God's name is that?

1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.000
It's thinking for itself now.

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:08.000
We have to warn Monarch.

1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:11.000
Or try to stop it ourselves.

1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:13.000
That thing's still linked
to their satellite.

1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:15.000
Wait, Josh.

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:17.000
If I can figure out
the password,

1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.000
maybe we can shut it down.

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:20.000
All right.

1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:35.000
What the hell is that?

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:28.000
What?

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000
What's happening?

1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000
She can feel his heartbeat.

1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:39.000
He's dying.

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000
There's nothing we can do
to restart his heart.

1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:45.000
We'd need a charge
big enough to...

1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:47.000
Light up Las Vegas for a week.

1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:12.000
Is that a password?
-

1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:15.000
Is that a password?

1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:16.000
I don't know!
I'm not used to this.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000
I'm used to pirating
movies online.

1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:19.000
-Okay, then go to Settings.
-

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:21.000
This is Mark.
-Dad?

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.000
Madison, where are you?

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.000
Dad, can you hear...

1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:27.000
Can you hear me?
I'm in Hong Kong.

1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.000
-Mad?
-Dad!

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000
Mad? Madison!

1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:36.000
-A-ha!

1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000
Okay, you two better
get some distance.

1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:50.000
Hey.

1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000
You are
a very brave little girl.

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000
I don't know.

1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:05.000
Maybe we both are.

1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000
-

1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:45.000
Okay.

1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000
Good luck, big fella.

1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000
-

1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000
-

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000
I thought you said
you were a hacker!

1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000
I said I took an HTML course
at summer camp.

1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000
-HTML?
-Yes, at summer camp.

1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000
Was it a '90s camp?
Come on. Use QWERTY.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000
Error. Security lock.

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000
- No. Shit!

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000
Shit.

1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:14.000
-

1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000
Josh!
You have to do something.

1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:21.000
We tried to take down
those Apex bastards,

1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000
but I think this is
as far as we go,

1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:24.000
so bottom's up.

1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000
I was hoping to die
with adults, but okay.

1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:34.000
If you've never
had a drink before,

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.000
Drink. Drink!

1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000
Hey! What are you...
-

1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:41.000
That's your solution?

1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.000
I gotta die here with you,
and sober!

1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000
Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:03.000
Hey, Nathan?

1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000
-Nathan?
-

1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000
Nathan, are you okay?

1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:34.000
Dad?

1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.000
Dad!

1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.000
Dad!

1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.000
Hi. Um, it was, um...
Madison's idea.

1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.000
Shut up, Josh.

1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:56.000
Dad. This is the man
who saved our lives.

1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000
Bernie, meet Dad.

1:42:58.000 --> 1:42:59.000
Dad. Uh, Bernie.

1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000
Um, it's an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:04.000
I was wondering
if I could invite you

1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:08.000
to talk about the Monarch
facility in Roswell because...

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:15.000
It's amazing. It happened...

1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000
-

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:30.000
Jia? Jia!

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:49.000
Heads up, guys! He's coming
around for his morning walk.

1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000
that I breathe

1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:23.000
that I breathe

1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:34.000
that I breathe

1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:51.000
that I breathe

1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:59.000
that I breathe

1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:08.000
that I breathe
