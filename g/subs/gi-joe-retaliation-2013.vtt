01:21.600 --> 01:24.001
<i>Hustle up, guys.
You've got to get that defector</i>

01:24.080 --> 01:26.242
<i>and get the hell out of there. No delays.</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:34.526
Hey, Mouse, are you ready
with that 18-year-old aim?

01:34.840 --> 01:36.365
I'm on it, sir.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.561
Move. Let's go.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.840
All right, come on.
Where is this guy at?

02:07.200 --> 02:09.726
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.966
All right, Mouse. Give us that diversion.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.561
Let's move.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.365
Flint, stay put.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.609
Anyone ever tell you you fight ugly?

02:46.920 --> 02:48.365
Not from their backs, they don't.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.926
It's just...

02:50.080 --> 02:52.401
Flint, let's go. Flint?

02:52.720 --> 02:54.131
What the hell are you doing?

02:54.440 --> 02:55.771
<i>Just marking our territory, sir.</i>

02:56.200 --> 02:58.407
Private Gaines,
if you see Flint, shoot him.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.686
With pleasure.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.006
Defector in hand.
En route to pickup. Come on.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.801
I don't see him, do you?

03:14.480 --> 03:16.050
<i>Flint, get your ass
back to the team.</i>

03:16.120 --> 03:17.485
<i>We are on the move.</i>

03:19.320 --> 03:22.085
Uh, you ain't gonna
believe this, Roadblock.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.567
Mother...

03:38.080 --> 03:39.081
Yeah!

03:43.440 --> 03:44.441
What?

03:48.360 --> 03:51.443
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.
Unfair advantage.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.521
I'm better.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.689
He's got smooth cheeks.
He's got no facial hair.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.649
- I'm gonna pull the pin.
- There's less friction underwater.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.410
That's a foul. That's a foul.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.206
A Joe flag.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.441
A G.l. Joe flag.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.647
That was a nice touch, right?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.850
Yeah. You can call it that.

04:06.960 --> 04:07.961
And what would you call it?

04:08.640 --> 04:10.210
- Undignified.
- Yeah, that, too.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.007
You know in victory,
we should be gentlemen.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.890
Oh!

04:17.959 --> 04:18.961
- Hey. Jaye!
- Yo!

04:19.040 --> 04:20.849
How long can
the average man hold his breath?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Ninety seconds.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.526
- Free hand.
- You got it, boss.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.364
All right. Easy, Flipper.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.641
Mmm.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.690
Back. Damn, that's good.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.602
There's nothing wrong
with taking a victory lap. It's fun.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.401
This is how it works. G.l. Joe's a fist.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.409
Us, we're the knuckles.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.481
How do we strike?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.001
Together.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.521
A finger strays...

04:46.960 --> 04:48.200
- it gets broken.
- It gets broken.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.931
Knuckles, again? Really?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.003
As a friend,
you've got to get a new speech.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.124
And the next time
you want to drown somebody,

04:57.120 --> 04:58.121
just invite me.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.882
<i>Since the end
of the nanomite wars,</i>

05:10.960 --> 05:14.487
<i>Captain Duke Hauser now leads
Joe Tactical Operations.</i>

05:14.880 --> 05:18.202
<i>Under Duke's command are Roadblock,</i>

05:28.280 --> 05:31.409
<i>The ruthless terrorist known
as Cobra Commander,</i>

05:32.640 --> 05:34.130
<i>and Destro</i>

05:35.080 --> 05:37.003
<i>have been captured by the G.l. Joes</i>

05:37.080 --> 05:39.765
<i>and placed in
a maximum security prison.</i>

05:40.640 --> 05:43.610
<i>But the Cobra operatives, Storm Shadow</i>

05:44.280 --> 05:46.487
<i>and Zartan, remain at large.</i>

05:46.720 --> 05:48.609
<i>The unit and the world</i>

05:48.920 --> 05:52.447

Cobra Commander's final vow.</i>

05:55.600 --> 05:56.681
<i>Retaliation.</i>

06:31.000 --> 06:33.162
The ear that sees.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.125
An ancient Arashikage test.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.050
Jinx, cousin to Storm Shadow,

06:46.440 --> 06:51.048
it's time to prove that you are ready
to join the G.l. Joes.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.289
Defend yourself.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.564
I'm ready, Blind Master.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.001
Ears, open.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.290
Snake Eyes, your task.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.804
Test her abilities.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.525
Pluck a single hair from Jinx's head.

07:46.680 --> 07:47.681
Ah, good.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.123
One should be as nimble as a cat,

07:51.960 --> 07:53.371
yet fierce as a tiger.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.289
Snake Eyes wins.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.963
Jinx, in order to excel in war,

09:14.480 --> 09:15.970
you must first find peace.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.801
Snake Eyes,

09:23.440 --> 09:25.841
you have earned the Blade of Justice.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.489
Made of black carbon fibre.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.564
Cruel. Indestructible.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.170
There are rumours of a new attack
by our enemies.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.169
You must leave the dojo to uncover
these plans and stop them.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.242
But move swiftly.
You may already be too late.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.081
<i>Contact front! Contact front!</i>

09:53.520 --> 09:56.842
<i>Heavy enemy fire! I need you to bring
them up the line. Bring them up the line.</i>

09:57.200 --> 09:58.281
<i>Check that, Block,
but I can't, man.</i>

09:58.360 --> 09:59.441
<i>I'm taking rounds back here.</i>

09:59.520 --> 10:00.681
<i>I</i> need you!
<i>I</i> need you now!

10:00.760 --> 10:02.888
<i>Air strike! Call in an air strike!</i>

10:03.160 --> 10:05.288
Wait. How do you call in an air strike?

10:05.360 --> 10:06.600
- Jesus!
- Can I bring...

10:06.680 --> 10:08.921
What about one of those, like,
care package thingies?

10:09.040 --> 10:11.691
I'm bleeding out
and I need you to sprint.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.441
Can you use a care package thingy?
I can bring you one.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.204
A care package thingy?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.123
Who is shooting me? What is...

10:18.720 --> 10:20.722
I'm bleeding out right there and you're...

10:24.360 --> 10:25.566
Are you spinning?

10:25.680 --> 10:26.886
You got to cover 360.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.041
- You're spinning.
- Huh?

10:28.240 --> 10:30.811
How could you be so good at combat?
You stink at this.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.882
I think you need to relax.
I believe I outrank you,

10:33.080 --> 10:34.650
- last time I checked.
- Not in my house, you don't.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.561
Oh! All right. Taking fire!

10:37.880 --> 10:39.928
Enemy fire! Time out! Enemy fire!

10:41.760 --> 10:43.046
Enemy contact!

10:43.200 --> 10:45.043
Uncle Duke, you have big ears.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.408
You got a big head.
Come here!

10:48.720 --> 10:50.245
Returning fire! What's up, now?

10:51.880 --> 10:52.927
Returning fire!

10:53.160 --> 10:54.924
You can't scream your way
out of this one!

10:55.080 --> 10:56.411
Yeah, requesting assistance,
brother Block!

10:56.560 --> 10:58.085
Pinned down, brother Duke.
Pinned down.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.123
That's all right. I got my boy here.
Demon dog!

11:04.960 --> 11:07.361
Grandma, help us!
We need backup!

11:09.120 --> 11:12.249
Not the first time you sent a girl
running out of the room screaming.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.123
Not the first time
I sent two girls screaming from a room.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.765
Dude, completely inappropriate.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.249
- I'm just saying.
- Completely.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.885
<i>Violence continues across Pakistan</i>

11:22.960 --> 11:24.246
<i>in the capital of Islamabad</i>

11:24.320 --> 11:25.890
<i>following the assassination
of President...</i>

11:25.960 --> 11:27.689
The future of the country

11:27.760 --> 11:29.649
<i>and control of its nuclear arsenal
appear to be up in the air</i>

11:29.720 --> 11:31.688
<i>as the vacuum created
by the killing remains.</i>

11:36.960 --> 11:39.361
The Pakistani
President may in fact be dead,

11:39.440 --> 11:41.966
but Pakistan remains an ally.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.441
And a sovereign nation.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.281
Was.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.967
Right now, they're a riot with a zip code.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.926
Sir, every minute
we spend debating this,

11:51.000 --> 11:52.923
there are live nuclear warheads

11:53.120 --> 11:54.724
that sit amidst the chaos.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.929
We can't let our enemies
get those warheads first.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.124
Recommendations?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.321
Go in.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.085
Now.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.325
Wait and see.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.767
History rewards the bold.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.243
I'm not going to be the man
who waited and saw.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.922
Get me the G.l. Joes.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.005
<i>Star One Flight commander
separating for drop.</i>

12:30.240 --> 12:31.924
All right, listen up!

12:32.160 --> 12:34.322
That nuke cannot have gone far.
Once we have it,

12:34.680 --> 12:36.842
we will disarm it en route to the L.Z.!

12:37.120 --> 12:38.849
We have its location narrowed down

12:38.960 --> 12:41.281
to somewhere in this
missile assembly building.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.362
We'll go in on the roof,
and fan out from there.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.922
Flint, Jaye, if any support is needed,
you'll reinforce

12:47.000 --> 12:48.331
as Roadblock leads the ground team.

12:48.920 --> 12:49.967
Hell, yeah.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.571
Hey, Mouse.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.169
On my first drop
I popped a live round into my mouth.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.130
Keeps your teeth from chattering.
Give it a shot.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.329
- Delicious.
- Attaboy.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.040
Jaye, what are we up against?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.929
Insurgents are armed
with Kalashnikovs,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.490
SVD Dragunovs and Type 50s.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.360
Cold War stuff.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.723
But don't relax, boys,
still put holes in you.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.445
Whoa! What have you got there?

13:19.720 --> 13:23.964
P-dub 381 black Tempest,
just out of the box. Rounds.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.328
Quarter speed, remote controlled.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.611
When did we get these?

13:28.920 --> 13:31.127
We didn't. We did.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.129
Distinguished Marksmen.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.369
- Let me see.
- Don't touch.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.924
Girls with guns.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.683
Approaching target.
Ten-hut! Make ready!

13:47.840 --> 13:49.001
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

13:49.240 --> 13:51.242
Anyone else missing Snake Eyes?

13:51.480 --> 13:53.209
I trained with Snake for six years.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.089
If he ain't here, he's got good reason.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.482
<i>Arch-Angel, go for drop.</i>

13:57.600 --> 13:59.682
Brother Block, as always,

13:59.760 --> 14:02.366
would you mind leading us
in a few words, please, sir?

14:02.440 --> 14:05.364
In the immortal words of Jay-Z,

14:07.040 --> 14:08.963
"Whatever deity may guide my life,

14:09.520 --> 14:12.524
"dear Lord, don't let me die tonight.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.127
"But if I shall, before I wake,

14:16.480 --> 14:18.164
"I accept my fate."

14:19.120 --> 14:20.121
Hell, yeah?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.771
Hell, yeah!

14:21.880 --> 14:23.211
Hell, yeah.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.961
Equipment check!

14:29.120 --> 14:31.964
- Check!
- Check!

14:34.720 --> 14:36.290
- Check!
- Check!

14:36.440 --> 14:38.966
- Check!
- Drive it like you stole it!

14:41.200 --> 14:44.044
As your good friend,
you need a new catchphrase.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.731
- Hoo-ah!
- Hoo-ah!

14:50.520 --> 14:51.851
<i>Alpha, Bravo, radio check.</i>

16:00.560 --> 16:01.721
- <i>I</i> owe you one, Mouse.
- Clear!

16:19.880 --> 16:21.041
All right! I got eyes on the nuke!

16:21.240 --> 16:23.083
<i>Say again, I got eyes on the nuke!</i>

16:25.920 --> 16:27.365

<i>Team two secure. No losses.</i>

17:21.800 --> 17:23.928

17:50.960 --> 17:52.485
Home in time for Top Chef.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.170
Good job, Tiny Tim.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.169
All that Wii Combat Shooter
finally paying off, sir.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.321
Barn!

17:57.600 --> 17:58.761
- How you doing, sir?
- Good.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.285
All Joes present and accounted for.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.361
Sit rep?

18:01.520 --> 18:03.329
Rendered safe
and ready for transport, sir.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.008
Square this one away and go get a beer.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.326
- Sounds good.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.169
<i>Sir, the nukes have been
recovered and disabled.</i>

18:11.520 --> 18:13.841
<i>All Joe missions successful.</i>

18:17.440 --> 18:19.442
<i>Only minor injuries to report, sir.</i>

18:19.680 --> 18:22.763
<i>Transport crews are prepping
the L.Z. for evac at 0200 hours.</i>

18:23.000 --> 18:23.967
Great job, Captain.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.287
We're modifying
your extraction plan back here.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.691
Sit tight.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.769
Let's go, Rivera, let's go.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.371
Let me get this straight.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.364
One whole weekend,

18:34.440 --> 18:36.283
you looking after my little girls.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.686
Yep, as long as I can bring this.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.645
Look, I love your kids. I do.

18:42.840 --> 18:46.128
But they live to terrorize me.
You trained them well.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.201
And if you win?

18:49.520 --> 18:51.329
You have to take your next promotion.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.841
You pull a trigger,
I pull a trigger.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.681
I don't know if I'm gonna trust
a pastry from a gumbo chef.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.924
Think about the wind.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.165
Four knots? Left to right.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.561
Humidity, I say, is about 62 %.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.489
You gonna feed me
the barometric pressure, too?

19:19.560 --> 19:22.245
That's on the rise. Like your panties.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.209
You love my panties.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.569
That's an interesting choice of a joke.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.165
Of all the things you could say...

19:31.440 --> 19:33.602
- "You love my panties"?
- Are you gonna shut up?

19:33.680 --> 19:34.806
- What does that mean?
- You gonna shut up?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.846
- I'm looking out for you.
- I'm trying to do something.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.763
- I just don't...
- Shut up, just shut up.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.366
- I'm just saying.
- Just shut up.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.684
How's your heart rate?

19:48.760 --> 19:50.683
That is not gonna count.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.603
I get to go again because you talked.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.964
You pulled a trigger.
Now I pull a trigger.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.245
No, we're not doing that.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.487
That is not gonna count.

20:06.760 --> 20:07.807
Cheater.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.809
I bought my little girls
a karaoke machine

20:09.920 --> 20:13.083
and they love singing on it,
all night long.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.250
There's no bedtime curfew,
so they're going to be up all night.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.646
Make sure you bring your earplugs.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.326
Boom!

20:20.400 --> 20:22.243
- C'mon, best two out of three.
- No.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.446
Best two out of three. That didn't count.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.010
You didn't tell me
about the karaoke machine.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.291
Zandan

20:40.480 --> 20:42.005
Mr President.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.764
Aren't you supposed to stop people
from shooting my dad?

20:55.480 --> 20:56.481
Baldy.

20:56.920 --> 20:57.921
Idiot.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.684
Enough out of you, Lee Harvey.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.608
Go clean up the chocolate stains
you left in your mother's bedroom.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.363
Kitty likes to scratch.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.569
Next time,

21:12.360 --> 21:13.691
take out his fat ass.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.768
It would be my pleasure, sir.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.128
I brought you some news.

21:33.840 --> 21:37.686
The G.l. Joes are about to be
out of the picture.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.768
And by "out of the picture," I mean

21:44.320 --> 21:46.687
alive on earth.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.290
Got a little too close to Mount Olympus.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.401
Huh?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.688
Had to strike them down.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.205
They'll find you out, Zartan.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.926
No. No, I don't think so.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.722
That's the beauty of nanomites.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.650
Here, take a look.

22:09.760 --> 22:10.761
Hmm?

22:22.480 --> 22:24.801
Flawless microtechnology.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.485
You're insane.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.922
Recess over. Sit him down.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.445
You know, they say
this is a thankless job.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.283
But yesterday I hung outwith Bono.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.282
My new Secret Service,

22:41.360 --> 22:43.283
they want to burn the Constitution.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.840
Literally.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.971
And my interns...

22:49.160 --> 22:52.642
Oh, yeah, I brought back the interns.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.801
Mmm-mmm.

22:55.560 --> 22:58.803
Do you know my favourite bit?
I get to blow stuff up.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.723
Oh, I bet that endears you to the people.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.201
Well, that's the thing.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.800
Your approval ratings
climbed nine points.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.563
Apparently, America wants
someone who looks like you,

23:10.640 --> 23:12.244
but acts like me.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.971
I'm the quicker blower-upper, baby.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.562
Only one drawback.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.925
The little wifey-pooh?
Huh?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.531
If you touch my family...

23:25.480 --> 23:27.244
I'm yanking your chain.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.649
Two long terms of you,

23:30.480 --> 23:32.687
just a few short months of me.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.241
So let's not waste the time I got left.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.766
Where is the prison that holds
Cobra Commander and Destro?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.607
Is this where I ask you,
what do you have planned?

23:42.840 --> 23:44.524
Why does anyone want to be President?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.844
Everybody wants to rule the world.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.089
<i>All squads,
gear up and clear the L.Z.</i>

23:59.560 --> 24:01.210
Prepare for extraction.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.727
Extraction? What are we, teeth?

24:04.240 --> 24:06.561
- Reach H.Q.?
- No, I got nothing.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.561
- Go up high.
- Roger, Sarge.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.561
Block.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.126
All our men accounted for.
Not a single drop of blood.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.326
- Boots to asses.
- Yes, sir.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.084
Except for that...
Did you scrape your elbow?

24:18.240 --> 24:20.766
- No, it's red sweat.
- Yup.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.801
That better have been
on somebody's face.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.726
Hey, Duke.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.286
You see that?

24:38.480 --> 24:39.811
Security's early.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.085
- Get down!
- Take cover!

24:43.200 --> 24:44.531
Take cover!

24:46.920 --> 24:48.524
To your weapons! Let's go!

24:57.680 --> 24:59.284
On the ground! On the ground!

25:04.680 --> 25:05.727
Mouse!

25:07.800 --> 25:08.881
Get 'em out of the L.Z.!

25:08.960 --> 25:09.961
JOE 1; Medic!

25:10.040 --> 25:11.087
Go!

25:17.640 --> 25:19.483
Flint's down! Flint's down!

25:19.800 --> 25:21.802
- I'm going for him!
- Go!

25:27.280 --> 25:28.486
Ten o'clock!

25:33.400 --> 25:34.481
Get down!

25:36.240 --> 25:38.402
Troops in contact!
Request immediate air support!

25:38.480 --> 25:40.244
I repeat, immediate air support!

25:42.080 --> 25:44.481
You all right? Come on, we got to move!
Go, go, go!

25:47.240 --> 25:48.401
Help me!

25:49.000 --> 25:51.002
You good? You hit?

25:51.840 --> 25:53.524
Block, I got Flint. We got to get to cover!

25:54.960 --> 25:56.007
Come on.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.841
Incoming! Incoming! Go, go, go, go, go!

26:13.640 --> 26:15.165
<i>Duke, come in.</i>

26:16.240 --> 26:17.241
Duke!

26:18.240 --> 26:19.287
Duke!

26:20.440 --> 26:21.646
Get to cover, now!

26:23.880 --> 26:24.881
Go!

26:27.160 --> 26:29.606
- Pull back! Rally point!
- Let's go!

26:34.760 --> 26:36.091
Get to the well! Go!

26:36.160 --> 26:37.844
Clear 'em out of there.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.001
Fall back! Fall back!

27:45.160 --> 27:46.241
We're clear.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.127
Let's go!

28:07.880 --> 28:10.724
We have met the enemy

28:13.160 --> 28:14.810
<i>and he is us.</i>

28:16.240 --> 28:19.847
<i>Today, the world's elite fighting force,
the G. I. Joes,</i>

28:20.160 --> 28:22.242
<i>abandoned their duty</i>

28:25.480 --> 28:28.927
<i>and broke the sacred bond
that exists between</i>

28:29.360 --> 28:30.805
<i>the American people</i>

28:31.000 --> 28:33.924
<i>and those entrusted with their security.</i>

28:37.520 --> 28:40.000
Ready and step.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.205
Ready and

28:43.480 --> 28:44.481
step!

28:44.680 --> 28:48.366
<i>The first domino fell with
the murder of the Pakistani president.</i>

28:49.120 --> 28:50.610
The assassin,

28:51.160 --> 28:52.491
a <i>Joe,</i>

28:53.840 --> 28:55.330
<i>call sign</i>

28:56.200 --> 28:57.690
<i>Snake Eyes.</i>

28:59.160 --> 29:00.889
<i>But he didn't act alone.</i>

29:03.480 --> 29:06.131
<i>The Joes intended to use this situation</i>

29:06.200 --> 29:09.568
<i>to seize Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.</i>

29:09.880 --> 29:11.325
<i>Now this incident</i>

29:11.400 --> 29:15.530
<i>serves as a sobering reminder
of the scourge of nuclear weapons.</i>

29:15.800 --> 29:17.484
And to that end,

29:17.800 --> 29:20.451
I call upon my fellow world leaders

29:20.520 --> 29:23.683
to convene immediately to discuss

29:24.000 --> 29:26.207
nuclear disarmament.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.646
On three.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.482
One.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.040
Two.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.446
Three!

29:36.160 --> 29:37.764
The G.I. <i>Joes</i>

29:37.920 --> 29:41.049
<i>clearly went beyond
the boundaries of their mission.</i>

29:41.120 --> 29:42.201
<i>On my orders</i>

29:42.480 --> 29:45.848
a <i>covert Special Forces unit
code named Cobra</i>

29:46.040 --> 29:50.329
<i>terminated with extreme prejudice
Joe Command,</i>

29:51.040 --> 29:52.883
<i>facilities, personnel.</i>

29:57.520 --> 30:01.206
The G.l. Joes are no more.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.971
We should leave.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.530
There's nothing here.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.120
There's nothing left here?

30:54.240 --> 30:56.049
- That's not what he meant!
- These are our brothers!

30:56.120 --> 30:57.246
That's not what he meant!

31:01.760 --> 31:04.969
Whoever did this is going to come back.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.091
We need to move.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.281
You are our leader now.

31:26.760 --> 31:30.367
We head due east until we're clear.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.170
We're gonna find the man
who did this to Duke

31:35.240 --> 31:36.526
and our brothers.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.250
And we're gonna kill him.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.080
Snake Eyes.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.402
Last place I thought I'd see you.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.771
Warden James. It's a pleasure.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.811
I'm a very big fan. I love the black.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.405
It's very Johnny Cash.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.051
Come. Welcome to Einsargen.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.727
Let me tell you a little bit
about the place.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.883
Listen to me.
I sound like a real-estate agent.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.610
I'm not here to sell you anything.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.446
Except maybe hopelessness.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.765
How was your trip?

33:14.280 --> 33:17.648
The sensation that you're feeling,
your upside-down tummy?

33:17.960 --> 33:20.725
It's due to our descent into
a former East German mine shaft.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.802
It was the deepest they ever dug.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.203
So deep in fact that
you just crossed out of Germany

33:26.280 --> 33:28.123
into international territory.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.483
Which allows me

33:31.200 --> 33:33.328
certain jurisdictional freedoms.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.127
Huh?

33:41.320 --> 33:42.651
One word,

33:43.080 --> 33:46.163
awesome. This room is awesome!

33:46.720 --> 33:50.088
Temperatures here exceed 210 degrees

33:50.480 --> 33:54.007
when not artificially cooled to a crisp 68.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.926
Almost calls for a Snuggie.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.845
Wait till you see this next one.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.523
See what I mean? This just slays me.

34:11.520 --> 34:14.683
It's so interesting.
This is where science has come.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.603
Did you know that during REM sleep,

34:17.920 --> 34:19.684
the human body

34:21.000 --> 34:22.603
produces a neural chemical

34:22.920 --> 34:24.684
which paralyses
every muscle in the body

34:24.760 --> 34:27.525
but the heart and the eyes?
This prevents us

34:27.840 --> 34:29.524
from acting out our dreams.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.610
We have injected both of these men

34:33.360 --> 34:34.804
with a synthetic version.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.043
They're perfectly awake.
They're conscious,

34:37.120 --> 34:39.885
they're aware of everything
that's going on around them.

34:41.040 --> 34:44.043
It's just that they're
trapped inside themselves.

34:45.880 --> 34:50.204
Well, I believe you know
your new neighbours, Destro,

34:55.600 --> 34:56.931
Cobra Commander.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.645
Oh, the three of you are like
my fantasy football team.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.046
Gentlemen.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.562
Now as your eyes and mind

35:15.920 --> 35:19.925
travel to where you cannot,
I want you to agonize.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.924
I want you to pine.

35:22.240 --> 35:26.086
I want you to ache for what once was
and will never be again.

35:26.920 --> 35:30.083
I want you to doubt
that there was ever a word for escape.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.250
Welcome to hell.

35:35.440 --> 35:38.091
You have no idea.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.922
Snake Eyes speaks.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.126
It never occurred to me
what you might sound like.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.125
But I've always thought about
what you might look like.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.283
We'll have that mask.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.803
Storm Shadow.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.962
So you killed the Pakistani president.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.043
Well, you're not exactly
my first-round draft pick,

36:14.120 --> 36:16.122
but I've always been a fan.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.641
Protocol says we make
a distress call, right?

36:23.720 --> 36:26.530
No.
Protocol died with the unit.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.761
What?

36:27.840 --> 36:29.251
How's anybody gonna know we're alive?

36:29.320 --> 36:30.401
They're not, 'cause we're not.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.531
To our government,

36:32.840 --> 36:36.049
to our families,
but especially to our enemy,

36:36.120 --> 36:39.124
we were KIA at 0600 hours
in the Indus Valley Desert.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.282
But we have to at least try.
I mean, there might be...

36:41.440 --> 36:44.205
No. Anything we do now
is a rumour of a rumour.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.281
Any and all traces

36:45.520 --> 36:47.329
of our existence is terminated.

36:47.760 --> 36:50.650
The only one I trust out there
is Snake Eyes.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.765
When we got hit,

36:55.640 --> 36:57.130
how we got hit,

36:57.920 --> 36:59.763
we were set up right from the start.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.164
How many stars would
someone need on their shoulder

37:02.280 --> 37:04.647
to call an attack like that? Four? Five?

37:04.720 --> 37:07.405
No, not stars. Buttons on his suit.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.530
National Security Advisor.
Secretary of Defence.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.888
No. There's only one man
who could authorize a strike like that.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.404
And I voted for him.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.842
All vitals
on Cobra Commander are steady.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.008
Storm Shadow
nerve prohibitors injected.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.608
Sixty-two degrees on a change of 4 %.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.371
Aerial threat! Down!

39:13.000 --> 39:14.445
We're going home.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.962
Full arrest! Full arrest!

39:47.440 --> 39:49.090
No drill! Bring the restraints!

39:49.240 --> 39:50.571
Remove the containment lid!

39:51.960 --> 39:53.689
Where's the serum? Quickly!

39:55.320 --> 39:57.641
Adrenaline now. Now! Adrenaline!

39:57.880 --> 40:00.087
Let's go! Quickly, quickly!

40:01.280 --> 40:02.361
Move! Move!

40:04.600 --> 40:06.125
Where's the serum?

40:10.040 --> 40:11.485
Let's go!

40:14.360 --> 40:15.361
Peel back! Move!

40:15.520 --> 40:17.124
What do you mean,
his heart stopped beating?

40:17.440 --> 40:20.046
No one here dies unless I say so!

40:20.880 --> 40:22.086
Oh, my God.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.161
Fire!

40:26.720 --> 40:27.881
Fire! Fire!

40:31.240 --> 40:32.446
Take him down!

40:32.680 --> 40:34.045
Take him down!

41:12.720 --> 41:14.131
Clear on the north!

41:14.560 --> 41:15.721
Clear!

41:41.600 --> 41:43.090
Welcome to hell.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.560
Stop!

43:16.000 --> 43:19.004
You shoot anything
that walks through that door!

43:19.960 --> 43:21.166
Anything!

43:27.000 --> 43:28.490
Storm Shadow.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.650
Never a doubt.

43:30.920 --> 43:32.729
Cobra Commander.

43:37.680 --> 43:38.727
<i>Desire.</i>

43:41.000 --> 43:42.843
You're out of the band.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.201
Come on.

43:44.520 --> 43:45.601
Come on.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.606
I see you've arranged transportation.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.404
Making more things go boom
by 9:00 a.m.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.523
than most people do all day.

44:20.880 --> 44:24.248
Firefly. Good to see you, old friend.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.766
Sir.

44:26.760 --> 44:29.081
Some people
just didn't want to let me in.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.567
Now, I busted out of eight prisons.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.444
But I only broke into one.

44:36.400 --> 44:40.405
All communications have been cut off.
No one will know you're even missing.

44:58.440 --> 45:00.602
Take him
to the mountains to heal.

45:00.760 --> 45:04.401
I'll need him
for the war I'm about to start.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.925
I want to help you.

45:54.120 --> 45:57.442
We've seen Storm's injuries.
We know where he's headed.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.650
And you need me.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.561
Good.

46:22.440 --> 46:26.445
Sir, launch controls are nearly up.
The director was running behind.

46:26.720 --> 46:30.884
Well, he ain't running behind no more.
Or anywhere else, for that matter.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.642
Armour prototype
is complete to your specs.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.609
I got it up to 60 on the dyno today.

46:36.840 --> 46:38.763
You'll like this. Working title,

46:38.840 --> 46:41.207
High Speed Sentry. HISS.

46:41.760 --> 46:43.569
It's good to have you back, sir.

46:48.960 --> 46:50.644
Ain't she a beauty?

46:50.960 --> 46:54.965
Soon the world
will cower in the face of Zeus.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.486
All we've been missing
is our Commander.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.925
Cool mask.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.122
Someone took his time.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.290
Not easy to sneak out of that big, white,

47:21.640 --> 47:24.120
11-bedroom, 35-and-a-half bath...

47:24.440 --> 47:26.727
Just don't forget who put you there.

47:26.800 --> 47:28.643
Or the rock you crawled out from.

47:28.920 --> 47:32.527
Firefly. It's good to know
we're not running low on crazy.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.650
Still all 10 fingers?

47:40.120 --> 47:41.770
How is our former President?

47:41.960 --> 47:44.122
Oh, he is worth his weight in platinum.

47:44.520 --> 47:47.808
You know, they call it a waterboard,

47:48.200 --> 47:50.123
but I never get bored.

47:51.440 --> 47:54.887
In 48 hours,
Zeus will launch.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.645
Just one wrinkle.

47:57.800 --> 48:00.485
Three Joes somehow survived
our little house cleaning.

48:01.440 --> 48:04.205
A drone picked up voiceprints
in the Indus Valley.

48:04.280 --> 48:06.248
Can I trust you with nothing?

48:06.480 --> 48:07.970
They'll slip up.

48:08.960 --> 48:10.803
And when they do,

48:11.600 --> 48:13.443
I'll hunt 'em to ground.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.525
<i>Hoe-ah.</i>

48:32.240 --> 48:33.924
No, no, it's cool.

48:34.480 --> 48:35.641
I got it.

48:37.160 --> 48:38.491
You lost, little man?

48:39.520 --> 48:41.010
No, I ain't lost.

48:41.480 --> 48:43.482
I think you got the wrong street.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.603
So why don't you take Miley Cyrus

48:45.680 --> 48:47.364
and Ryan Seacrest

48:48.360 --> 48:49.850
and head back that way?

48:50.840 --> 48:52.683
I'm going that way.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.361
0h. Yeah?

48:56.440 --> 48:57.566
Yeah.

48:59.760 --> 49:01.524
Go ahead, Marvin.

49:02.520 --> 49:04.329
Man, don't call me that name.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.451
What's up? Little Marvin!

49:06.680 --> 49:08.045
- Marvin?
- Big Marvin now.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.804
Had you worried for a minute, man.

49:09.960 --> 49:12.531
Watch your hand back there, boy.
You don't want them to get you.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.205
Look at you. You got grown.

49:14.280 --> 49:16.123
How your parents
make a kid this big, man?

49:16.360 --> 49:18.488
- His parents are like 5'2" apiece.
- Really?

49:18.600 --> 49:20.204
You're taking
that P90X serious, huh?

49:20.400 --> 49:21.606
Twice a week.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.728
I see. Look at the size of your neck.

49:24.600 --> 49:26.284
Let me introduce you. This is Flint.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.447
What up?

49:27.920 --> 49:29.046
Lady Jaye.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.201
Lady Jaye. Hey.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.211
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.528
It's what happens
when you're in trouble, you come home.

49:34.600 --> 49:35.761
Home is where the help is.

49:35.840 --> 49:36.841
Amen.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.725
Well, we got you.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.490
Set up at the rec centre.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.801
Lay low over there.
Nobody gonna bother you.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.004
As far as wheels go,

49:45.480 --> 49:47.323
I'm gonna let you roll my truck.

49:47.520 --> 49:48.567
Thank you.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.731
I got payments on that truck, man.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.848
I don't get it like I used to. All right?

49:52.920 --> 49:53.921
Thank you, Stoop.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.244
I owe you one, brother.

49:56.720 --> 49:59.246
Actually, you owe me two.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.250
That other one don't count.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.011
Welcome home, Marvin.

50:11.920 --> 50:13.331
Watch your step.

50:13.600 --> 50:16.809
No one's been here for years.
This is gonna have to be our pit for now.

50:22.640 --> 50:25.007
Wow. It's an actual pit.

50:26.120 --> 50:27.770
It's my old stomping ground.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.530
Are you sure
we can trust this Stoop guy?

50:31.880 --> 50:33.370
Stoop's no angel.

50:33.880 --> 50:35.882
But he is family and we can trust him.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.971
Can we be traced?

50:44.280 --> 50:46.123
We can mask our IP addresses.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.567
I'll cyber-blast an encoded beacon
every six hours.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.291
If any Joes did survive,

50:50.400 --> 50:51.640
we need to let them know
where we're at.

50:51.720 --> 50:53.051
All right. Well, let's get to work.

50:53.160 --> 50:55.401
Flint, inventory every piece
of equipment we got left.

50:55.480 --> 50:57.608
Jaye, start that database
on our President.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.331
We'll find out what's going on
with our Commander-in-Chief.

51:00.480 --> 51:03.563
He's not acting like the man we know.
We find out why,

51:03.720 --> 51:05.882
we can start being soldiers again.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.927
<i>Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
requesting immediate aid.</i>

52:07.040 --> 52:08.451
<i>If any Joes have survived...</i>

52:08.560 --> 52:10.961
This channel's restricted to Joes,
isn't it?

52:11.360 --> 52:13.283
<i>...magnetic west of the Potomac.</i>

52:13.560 --> 52:14.641
They're alive.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.406
<i>This is Lieutenant Lady Jaye
requesting immediate aid.</i>

52:18.480 --> 52:21.211
<i>Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
this is Jinx and Snake Eyes.</i>

52:21.280 --> 52:23.169
<i>We are in pursuit of Storm Shadow.</i>

52:27.800 --> 52:29.689
Even if Snake Eyes and Jinx
grab Storm,

52:29.760 --> 52:31.649
they're still halfway around the world.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.571
We're on our own.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.085
Enough for a battle.

52:40.080 --> 52:41.127
Not a war.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.765
We're fighting uphill here.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.923
I came here when I was 14
with a life expectancy of 13.

52:50.840 --> 52:54.162
I was bounced around
from home to home, until this

52:55.840 --> 52:57.410
became my home.

52:57.480 --> 52:59.448
Guys were lined up
outside that door to fight me.

53:00.520 --> 53:03.842
They whooped my skinny ass so much
I started to enjoy it.

53:04.440 --> 53:05.521
Till one winter,

53:06.680 --> 53:09.286
I grew 8 inches and gained 60 pounds.

53:10.680 --> 53:14.048
I punched a guy so hard
he couldn't move his arm to tap out.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.601
Then when the Joes
came recruiting to the hood,

53:16.800 --> 53:18.768
I'd already beaten down half of it.

53:20.680 --> 53:23.650
I became a Joe to serve. In the field.

53:24.240 --> 53:27.881
So if we're fighting uphill,
we take the hill.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.806
Hey, I got something
you'll want to see.

53:34.120 --> 53:36.487
During my check of the President,
look what I found.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.482
This is the President on August 9th.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.883
...an <i>addiction
to offshore energy,</i>

53:42.120 --> 53:45.010
<i>where we're forced to be
kind of embroiled</i>

53:45.080 --> 53:46.969
<i>in the affairs of foreign nations.</i>

53:47.160 --> 53:48.969
And this is 10 days later.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.044
<i>I mean, otherwise, we're sort of...</i>

53:53.520 --> 53:56.205
These are conversational fillers.
Little phrases

53:56.440 --> 53:58.169
we spit out to give our brain
a chance to catch up

53:58.400 --> 53:59.765
with our mouth. Like...

53:59.960 --> 54:01.291
- Like.
- Yes.

54:01.520 --> 54:02.885
And our President?

54:03.120 --> 54:05.122
Between August 9th and August 19th,

54:05.440 --> 54:06.965
he stopped using
"you know" and "kind of"

54:07.040 --> 54:09.202
and started using "I mean" and "sort of."

54:09.520 --> 54:11.887
But that's not all.
"Supper" became "dinner."

54:11.960 --> 54:13.166
"Soda" became "pop."

54:13.840 --> 54:16.320
One President, two fingerprints.

54:16.680 --> 54:18.569
But it's a few words, right?
I mean, how much can...

54:18.640 --> 54:19.687
Check this out.

54:20.680 --> 54:23.684
Two press conferences,
July 31st, September 1st.

54:25.520 --> 54:26.521
See his fingers clasped?

54:27.000 --> 54:29.207
Left thumb on top
versus right thumb on top.

54:29.400 --> 54:31.209
The same person
never does this differently,

54:31.280 --> 54:32.520
it feels wrong.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.522
What if the President

54:39.520 --> 54:41.045
isn't the President?

54:41.360 --> 54:45.206
Look, if the Commander-in-Chief
is an imposter

54:46.200 --> 54:48.521
and he's the one that ordered the attack,

54:48.880 --> 54:51.531
we have to assume
that there's no one we can trust.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.201
There is one man.

54:56.840 --> 54:59.491
He's the reason we call ourselves Joes.

55:28.920 --> 55:29.921
Hello?

55:42.640 --> 55:46.326
I'll take two cases of Thin Mints
and a box of Chuckle Lucks.

55:46.960 --> 55:48.644
Lower your weapons.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.971
General Colton, if I may...

55:53.400 --> 55:54.640
Shut your mouth, Brenda.

55:56.280 --> 55:58.089
My name's not Brenda.

55:58.320 --> 55:59.651
How'd you get in?

56:00.000 --> 56:01.650
Sir, apologies.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.162
- Sergeant Marvin...
- I know who you are.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.925
Then you know why I'm here.

56:14.160 --> 56:16.481
<i>It's not like
I don't hear what you're saying.</i>

56:17.320 --> 56:19.322
But an imposter President?

56:22.760 --> 56:25.525
How come when the General says it,
it sounds crazy?

56:26.920 --> 56:28.922
What'd they do with the real President?

56:29.200 --> 56:30.565
We fear he's dead.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.763
I don't think so.
You're not going to kill your best asset.

56:38.200 --> 56:40.043
"Conrad Hauser. Duke."

56:40.680 --> 56:42.045
Your captain.

56:46.200 --> 56:48.282
Tell me one thing you know about him.

56:48.680 --> 56:50.284
Great soldier.

56:52.440 --> 56:54.204
Better friend.

56:55.040 --> 56:57.042
And he saved my life, sir.

57:01.080 --> 57:02.127
Good.

57:05.640 --> 57:07.290
What you're proposing is treason.

57:07.960 --> 57:10.201
I'm gonna need something
a little more to go on

57:10.320 --> 57:11.810
than overlapping thumbs.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.482
Before you retired,
you served on a security commission

57:16.560 --> 57:18.483
with the President's Chief of Staff.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.563
General Colton, can you get us close?

57:20.960 --> 57:22.166
Negative.

57:23.480 --> 57:26.404
I can't scratch my ass in this town
without getting on the watch list.

57:26.640 --> 57:28.483
Brenda, hand me that pen.

57:30.400 --> 57:32.323
Girl Scout to secretary.

57:32.840 --> 57:35.684
Amazing. Name's not Brenda.

57:37.840 --> 57:39.490
It's just a pen.

57:40.280 --> 57:43.363
Avenue K, Georgetown. 9:00 p.m.

57:43.840 --> 57:46.844
There's a poker game
with the Chief of Staff there.

57:47.680 --> 57:49.170
He's not a good poker player.

57:49.360 --> 57:50.691
He's got 1,000 tells.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.364
We only need one.

57:59.880 --> 58:00.927
Hey, hon.

58:01.120 --> 58:04.044
Just got out of poker. Poorer but wiser.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.683
It was a good day, actually.

58:06.960 --> 58:09.361
The Prez was taking
his crazy pills again.

58:11.960 --> 58:14.281
Baby, I'm gonna have to call you back.

58:14.520 --> 58:15.726
Yeah.

58:15.880 --> 58:17.211
Love you.

58:22.880 --> 58:23.961
Excuse me.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.281
Oh, hi.

58:25.400 --> 58:26.561
Hi.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.723
You need a hand with your bags?

58:29.400 --> 58:30.561
Sure.

58:32.480 --> 58:33.527
No problem. There you go.

58:33.600 --> 58:34.601
Thank you.

58:35.040 --> 58:37.122
Who said chivalry is dead, right?

58:37.240 --> 58:38.321
Chivalry.

58:38.560 --> 58:41.564
Talk like that,
I'm gonna get myself in trouble.

58:41.880 --> 58:43.041
Where we heading?

58:43.120 --> 58:44.167
Just right around the corner.

58:53.720 --> 58:55.688
That tingly feeling is amobarbital.

58:55.800 --> 58:58.167
It's a sedative that causes
anterograde amnesia.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.891
In five minutes, you're gonna be asleep.

58:59.960 --> 59:02.486
In another five, you're gonna wake up
with no idea I ever existed.

59:09.200 --> 59:10.725
Notice anything strange
about your boss?

59:13.480 --> 59:15.403
Maybe. Why?

59:15.640 --> 59:18.211
'Cause you're gonna make
a phone call for us. Get us close to him.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.610
But don't worry.
You're gonna forget everything,

59:20.680 --> 59:22.808
so your conscience will be clear.

59:23.720 --> 59:25.643
Why are you doing this?

59:25.840 --> 59:27.968
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

59:30.120 --> 59:31.610
Make the call.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.041
Oh!

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.331
Thank God.

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:22.680
El Presidente <i>is</i> on a roll.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.611
<i>His numbers are up.</i>

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.126
<i>And I'm not just talking about his age.</i>

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.361
<i>Now, I'm not gonna call
our Commander-in-Chief old.</i>

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.890
<i>Actually, he called me the other day
for some advice.</i>

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.684
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.765
<i>He wanted to hook up
the nation's nuclear arsenal</i>

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.886
<i>to the Clapper.</i>

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.961
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're...

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.764
Late, I know.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.723
Imagine the army it takes
to make me look like this.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.841
Forgive me.
That's an army I'd like to enlist in.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.849
Speaking of lists,

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.520
would you like to explain
why you're not on ours?

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.403
Here she is. Chief of Staff.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.206
Enjoy your evening, Miss Vandervoort.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.201
<i>I'm in.</i>

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.243
Roger that. Standing by.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:18.281
Jaye?

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.401
You keep your head down. Be safe.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.170
<i>Mr Carville was
nice enough to mention</i>

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.210
<i>one of my passions.
Nuclear disarmament.</i>

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.930
<i>In just days,</i>

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.571
<i>the leaders of the world's
eight nuclear nations</i>

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.566
<i>will gather at historic Fort Sumter</i>

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.761
<i>for a nuclear summit.</i>

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.528
<i>But before the Atomic Eight
break bread,</i>

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.921
<i>it's our turn.</i>

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.724
Thank you, James. Thank you so much.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.600
Mr President.
Amy Vandervoort, Fox News.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.961
Oh, Fox, of course.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.247
That's why you look so
"fair and balanced."

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.961
Very cute.
But I was actually hoping to have a...

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.321
Dance?

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.124
- I was going to say, quote.
- Ah.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.725
<i>Okay, here's a quote.</i>

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.644
<i>The world will change
after my nuclear summit.</i>

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.290
<i>How about we dance?</i>

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.762
<i>I really, I don't dance.</i>

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.761
Sorry.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.642
<i>Thank you, Mr President.
You gave me what I need.</i>

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.802
<i>But I really have to make my deadline.</i>

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.130
- It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.770
How are you?

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.966
Good, sir.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.285
<i>I got</i> a <i>strand of hair
from his jacket. I hope it's enough.</i>

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.045
Come on.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.201
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.607
Standing by for I.D.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.844
All units, setting condition orange.
Stand by.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.565
I don't take no for an answer.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.609
Almost there.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.121
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.841
Zaï¬‚an?

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.483
Jaye, get out of there now.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.484
Oh, my God.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.160
We have an unauthorized I.D.
She's a Joe.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.322
We have a Joe on the premises.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.251
Jaye.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.211
Jaye, now.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.161
I'm out.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.770
<i>Plan B, rendezvous Bravo.</i>

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.569
Negative.
Proceed to rendezvous Charlie.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.801
<i>Charlie.</i>

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.129
What's that supposed to mean?

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.651
Sorry, Jaye.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.441
I got it from here.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.081
Don't.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.004
<i>We have proof.
We're taking it to Joe Colton.</i>

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.570
You planned this all along.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.324
<i>Block, stand down.</i>

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.767
We ain't lawyers. We're soldiers.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.527
I told you I was gonna
find the man who did this.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.041
I was gonna kill him.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.446
No! That's... No. Negative!

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.290
Block. Block.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.721
Damn it!

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.125
One in the chamber.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.683
Block? Block, where are you?

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.044
I want to see that face.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.287
The one where you realize
today's the day.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.411
It's the face all those pretty little Joes
had in the desert

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.249
when I lit them all up like fireworks!

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.928
I really want to see that face.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.605
There it is.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.322
If Cobra and Zartan
are in the White House,

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.084
then the world is at stake.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.727
Storm Shadow.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.401
You will tell us Cobra's endgame,

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.844
or die

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.290
by the same sword you once
used to kill our master.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.807
Your sword,

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.043
given to you
by our beloved Hard Master.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.449
Do you deny that your envy and hatred
drove you to shed

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.928
the Hard Master's blood?

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.805
<i>It's possible
to feel so much hate</i>

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.601
you stop feeling it at all.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.410
Like a fish not knowing it's in water.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.245
But my path was chosen for me

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.965
by my enemy

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.764
who framed me
for killing the Hard Master.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.924
And my friends

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.924
who believed it.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.042
Why defend yourself to men
too blind to see?

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.009
That is the Hard Master's blood.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.325
But that is not...

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.410
Wait!

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.811
...my sword.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.244
Arashikage steel does not break.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.165
I have asked myself over and over

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.922
who despised me enough
to destroy my life?

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.568
I am sorry,
Storm Shadow.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.328
But who would stand to gain the most
by framing you for this crime?

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.371
Your young adversary
who chased you away?

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:55.767
Or the man into whose arms
you were chased.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.362
<i>Someone who welcomed you,</i>

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.924
<i>showed you kindness.</i>

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.847
He needed me.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.044
For who I would become.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.961
A warrior of great skill and anger.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.204
<i>The man who betrayed me
was capable of great ingenuity,</i>

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.685
violence,

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.204
<i>but most of all,</i>

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.205
disguise.

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.365
<i>Zartan.</i>

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.451
Yes.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.843
<i>Tell us what he and Cobra have planned</i>

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.004
<i>so we can destroy our common enemy</i>

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.011
together.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.925
Try to hold still.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.410
You want to remind me how knuckles
are supposed to strike again?

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.161
Together.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.606
Those were your words.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.246
- I had a shot and I took it.
- Now, don't give me that!

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.321
You went rogue.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.367
And I'd do it again.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.522
Yeah? And what was
your big plan, then, huh?

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.330
You get yourself killed?

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:17.288
Jesus Christ. I listened to everything
you said over and over again.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.041
I never questioned...

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.368
I wasn't going to bury any more Joes.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.405
I've got guns to clean.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.321
Hey...

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.920
Help me out here?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.161
Thanks.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.162
If my dad could see me now...

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.930
What are you talking about?

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.931
He wouldn't believe it.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.001
Why?

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.442
Third generation military.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.206
Desperately wanted a fourth, and

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.404
my mom had me.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.681
Well, he must be
real proud of you, then.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.362
He didn't believe
in female soldiers.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.726
I finally asked him why. He said

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.204
he didn't want to put his life
in the hands of a woman.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.483
I enlisted the next day.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.202
Spent the next seven years

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.530
trying to outrank him
so he'd have to salute me.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.211
Did it work?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.002
He died before I got the chance.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.251
I'm sorry.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.765
I'm actually gonna miss the red.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.485
You look real nice.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.883
Hey. I said we got guns to clean.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.524
The world ain't saving itself.

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.364
That was for the tax hike.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.523
Like you pay taxes.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.962
Ain't always about me.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.564
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.724
We still need the man.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.886
Besides, we've grown close.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.369
Is Storm Shadow in?

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.565
Don't you worry about him.
He'll be more than ready.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.241
I'm not too impressed with your Cabinet.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.000
No confirmation
hearings, that's what you get.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.971
COBRA COMMANDER; Enough!

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.243
I'll take it from here.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.248
He who controls this briefcase,

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.245
controls the U.S. nuclear arsenal

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.924
and the fate of humanity.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.561
Open your eyes, Mr Ex-President.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.451
The eyes are
the windows to the soul.

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.645
Open up.

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.051
Zeus is ready.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:04.207
We just need
one final piece of the puzzle.

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.568
FIREFLY Well done.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.689
History will stand in judgement.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.364
Not of me. Of you.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.440
What do we got, Jaye?

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.286
Zartan's entire focus
has been this nuclear summit.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.044
It has to be the key
to whatever he's planning.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.362
All right. Well, then that's our target.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.201
Yeah.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.370
Guys, move.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.769
I think I'm faster than you, Snake Eyes.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.244
Damn Ninjas.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.930
Good to see you, brother.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.481
Jaye.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.081
Jinx.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.765
Back up.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.241
He's with us.

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.370
I am not with you.

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.370
But for this once,

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.450
I am not against you.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.045
How many of our men has he killed?

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.210
We're supposed to fight with him?

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:41.406
The leaders of the world
will gather tomorrow. It's a trap.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.608
Storm is the only one
who knows Cobra's plan

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.280
inside and out.
He can help us find a way to stop it.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.762
But we have to work together.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.041
All right.

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.886
Let's move.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.483
Merry Christmas.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.483
Makes you wonder
about your neighbours.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.481
Nice.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.646
Open up that couch.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.810
Anything?

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.090
I brought my own.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.365
Nice.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.611
Yeah, that'll work.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.281
Hey-

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.441
That one's mine.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.449
This really is Patton's gun, isn't it?

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.725
Gift from his family.

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:32.881
What an honour.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.801
You bet.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.122
I was actually thinking about
something a little more your size.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.163
Try not to scratch her up.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.962
Idles a little rough in neutral.

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.923
I ain't gonna be in neutral.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.005
<i>Hoe-ah.</i>

01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.291
What about you?

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.285
DOD says
I can't come out of retirement.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.846
They didn't say anything
about reenlisting.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.527
Reporting for duty, Sergeant Major.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.249
I'd like to bring a couple friends of mine.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.283
Colton's team,
it's our honour.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.647
You guys take the perimeter.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.688
Flint, Jaye, Snake,
you guys take the flank.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.521
Jinx and Storm, Trojan Horse.

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.849
Zartan will be holding the briefcase.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.849
Storm will be the closest man to him.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.526
But he can't move
until we're all in position.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.330
Everyone keep your eye on the prize.

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.927
We secure the football,
we secure the world.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.523
Snake, how's all that sound?

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.087
That's what I thought.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.161
Okay, wait. Hold on a second.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.046
We still have enemy armour
here, here, and here.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.401
Right?

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.727
These tanks survive, we don't.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.130
Leave the tanks to me.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.807
General?

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.961
Call me Joe.

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.050
- Anything I missed?
- No.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.130
Rock solid. My orders?

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.641
The President.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.482
- Brenda's with my team.
- Roger that.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.320
Does Brenda get a vote?

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.644
Negative.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.321
You need a pen?

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.485
I need your help.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.560
All right.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.649
Let's kick that ass! Hoo-ah!

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:25.841
<i>Hoe-aw!</i>

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.845
<i>A historic day for</i>

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.968
<i>the President of the United States
as he meets with...</i>

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.361
<i>This afternoon, the
President is meeting with the leaders</i>

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.885
<i>of the eight nuclear powers.</i>

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.769
<i>Never before
has a President been so bold</i>

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.201
<i>to call the leaders
of the world together...</i>

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.009
<i>These are
unprecedented nuclear talks</i>

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.525
<i>that most believed would never happen.</i>

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.171
<i>You can bet security is
at its highest...</i>

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.284
<i>We may be closer
to a nuclear-free world</i>

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.930
than we have ever been.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.526
<i>My fellow world leaders,</i>

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.365
<i>welcome to the hallowed grounds
of Fort Sumter,</i>

01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:00.045
whose proud walls saw the first shots
in our nation's grievous Civil War.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.651
<i>Here, men rushed through the breach
in a madness.</i>

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:08.522
<i>What better place to step back
from that same breach.</i>

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.042
<i>Renounce our darker natures.</i>

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.361
<i>Forgive our staunchest foes.</i>

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.488
This site is symbolic.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.730
Not only for the peace
we seek to achieve,

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.361
<i>but the conflagration we seek to avoid.</i>

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.367
<i>The Cobras who protect us today</i>

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.287
<i>are dedicated to the belief
that there is no greater peace</i>

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.890
<i>than peace of mind.</i>

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.802
Thank you.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.405
I'll say it again.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.245
The world is safer
with a nuclear presence.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.849
I'm sure your electorate will be happy
by our final proposal.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.562
50 % reduction by 2016.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.606
There are a lot of leaders in this room.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.684
But only one leader of the free world.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.525
And he,

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.367
I, stay with me,

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.922
asked you here with the goal
of universal disarmament.

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.566
Nuclear zero.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.525
Now, I was prepared
to cajole to get what I want.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.684
I'm now at threaten.

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:26.129
Each of you will clear out
his nuclear closet immediately.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.690
Failure to participate
will be considered an act of war.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.890
You're joking, of course.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.450
This summit is over.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:35.646
ZARTAN Then this is it.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.281
This is it, boys.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.762
This country is at war.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.130
With you and you and you
and you and you and you.

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.090
<i>Delta team in position.
Echo, you're</i> a <i>go.</i>

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.847
<i>This is Echo. Beginning assault.</i>

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.643
The U.S. nuclear arsenal

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:11.363
is capable of destroying
each of your countries 14 times over.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.489
Fifteen, in the case of North Korea,
just to be sure.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.684
And all

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.931
at the push

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.367
of a button.

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.449
It's true. Yeah!

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.166
Yeah, I pressed it.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.646
You have lost your mind!

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.084
It's all relative.

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.642
You got three minutes to decide.

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.406
- You got next watch?
- Maintain radio silence.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.566
We cannot, we will not leave
a legacy of acquiescence!

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.330
Bring the briefcase.

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.731
Don't do this!

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.411
There can be no winners!

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:33.123
Ooh. High score.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:37.928
Let history record
who was responsible for this madness.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.171
Launch.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.244
Launch.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.006
Eyes on the Emerald City.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.284
<i>Jaye and Colton,
you're a go for POTUS.</i>

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.007
You all right?

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.163
Yeah. You all right?

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.003
My cholesterol's a little high.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:58.322
<i>Jaye and General Colton.
Checkpoint neutralized.</i>

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.325
You're on your own.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.165
Well, the good news is,
no global warming summit next month.

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.851
Unless

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.369
one of us cared enough
about his place in history

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:25.206
to unilaterally disable his warheads.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.641
Hmm?

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.285
You know, in the name of the children.

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.364
Any volunteers?

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.364
No? Fine.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.846
Me.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.042
Call your people to confirm.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.964
You're a complete lunatic.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.362
Says the man about to destroy Asia.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.171
Come on,
who's going to follow suit, huh?

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.802
Are you really going to stand by
and watch as Earth is destroyed?

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.201
Abort!

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.242
I figured North Korea for last.

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.884
Got to love the little guy.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.885
Gentlemen.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.851
Welcome to a nuclear-free world.

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.768
I want to direct your attention
to live images of your homelands.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.691
Now, you're looking
at an advanced weapons system

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.604
we call Project Zeus.

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.329
There are seven Zeus satellites
orbiting Earth.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.481
<i>Each satellite contains
10 hollow platinum tubes</i>

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.642
<i>filled with a tungsten rod.</i>

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.281
Zeus satellite 1-A approaching London.

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.047
Ordnance live and loaded.
Awaiting drop authorization.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:10.843
Now, to direct a rod to its target,
we don't launch it or fire it.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.207
We drop it!

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.881
Gravity does the rest.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.651
Observe.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.522
Satellite 1-A.
We have remote launch authorization.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.483
Three, two, one,

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.921
drop.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.324
A rod touches down
eight times faster than a bullet.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.167
And with a force significantly greater
than a nuclear warhead.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.490
None of the fallout.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.044
All of the fun.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.648
You will have to
answer for this.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.481
To your Congress, your courts.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:24.367
Correction,
they will have to answer to me.

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.403
What is it you want?

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.162
I want it all.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:56.209
The Cobra revolution has begun.

01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:01.841
By pressing that button,
Zartan initiated an auto-drop sequence.

01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.725
My Zeus satellites
are moving into position

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.604
over your six remaining countries.

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.805
Satellites 2-A through 7-A
en route to targets.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.365
The same button that begins this
can end it.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.042
But I only press it for a price.

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.361
Total allegiance.

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.444
<i>Block, secure the perimeter!</i>

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.046
Get the control case from Zartan.
I'm going to drop them all.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.001
Head to the door! Go, go, go!

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.649
Satellites en route to targets.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.842
Beginning command protocols.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.371
Follow that ground team! Go!

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:23.561
Stay.

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.443
<i>On your six, Cobra two!</i>

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:52.210
Cobra one, Cobra one,
I need eyes on! Eyes on!

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.566
Damn it.

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:19.281
<i>We've got her cornered.</i>

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.084
<i>She ain't going anywhere.</i>

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.841
Go!

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.646
Storm.
I never figured you for a Joe.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.842
I'm very disappointed in you.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.006
You're a bitch to hit.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.401
Traitor.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.046
Storm.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.650
You know, this sword
was never intended

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:46.206
for anyone
with anger management issues.

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.921
Boom!

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.284
- What was that?
- Shut up.

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.045
- Ray?
- Yes, sir.

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.610
Check the door. Give me a sit rep.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.761
I'm on it.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.411
You two secure the entrance.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.484
- What are you doing?
- Let's go. We're out of here.

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.569
Stand down. I'm gonna shoot him!

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.085
I said stand down!

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:16.162
Be a good G.l. Joe and drop the gun.
We're walking out of here.

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.050
I will shoot him in the head.
Do you understand me?

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.004
You're not listening, are you?
Put the gun down!

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.241
Drop it!

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.285
<i>Easy, 88$'! -</i>

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.611
Put some pressure on it.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.245
General Colton.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.164
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:39.328
- Sorry, Mr President.
- No, it's fine.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.965
Come on. Let's move.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.247
Here we go.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.200
Roadblock, POTUS secure.
No casualties.

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:48.881
<i>Roger that, Jaye.</i>

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.682
You betrayed the Hard Master.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:03.011
And made me what I am.

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:04.566
Yep.

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.570
Yeah, I can see that was wrong.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.490
<i>We need eyes
on Firefly and Cobra ASAP.</i>

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.444
Courtyard clear. No sign of him.

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.249
Commander, I have the case.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.365
<i>We are still a go.</i>

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:57.771
How long till drop?

01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.165
On schedule, Commander.
Five minutes to live fire.

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.441
Final targeting to begin shortly.

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.444
Zeus satellites 4 and <i>7</i> in position.

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:14.009
Zeus satellites 2, 3, 5, and 6
are locked on target. France,

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.931
Russia, North Korea,

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.324
<i>India, Israel, China.</i>

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.161
Block.

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.326
<i>Cobra Commander's bugging out.</i>

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.806
No sign of Firefly.

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.611
I've got him.

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.886
Targets acquired.
Ordnance live and loading.

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.682
Zeus 4 is ready to fire. Hatch is open.

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.841
- Get him!
- Take him out!

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:25.049
You want that case?

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.409
You're gonna have to come through me.

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:29.170
Oh, yeah.

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:31.441
That's right.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.844
<i>All satellites have begun load
for final countdown.</i>

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.011
<i>Launch codes confirmed.</i>

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.085
Ten seconds to live fire.

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:56.681
<i>Ten.</i>

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.240
<i>Nine.</i>

01:49:58.440 --> 01:49:59.771
<i>Eight.</i>

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.447
<i>Seven. Six.</i>

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:03.847
<i>Five.</i>

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.291
<i>Four.</i>

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.765
<i>Three.</i>

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.205
<i>Two.</i>

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.124
Threat terminated.

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.803
Team Bravo, perimeter has been
cleared and secured.

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.689
<i>Joe Command to
covert operations.</i>

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:55.165
<i>We have control of the perimeter.</i>

01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.769
<i>Medical personnel are on the scene.</i>

01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.080
<i>All Joes are accounted for.</i>

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:00.764
<i>We're going home.</i>

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.762
<i>The President is
back safe in the Oval Office today,</i>

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:16.241
<i>presiding over a ceremony
honouring the G.l. Joes.</i>

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.560
<i>With the world
back in order,</i>

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:19.961
<i>rebuilding has begun around the world.</i>

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:22.487
<i>Those
who stand beside us,</i>

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:25.371
<i>the world knows them as Joes.</i>

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.011
<i>We know them as heroes.</i>

01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:35.371
Jinx.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:37.690
Welcome to the Joes.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.001
Flint.

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.527
Great job.

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.566
Captain Jaye Burnett.

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.565
I served with your father.

01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:59.848
He'd be very proud of you.

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:13.689
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the G. I. Joes.</i>

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:24.801
Hey-

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.921
For when you find Cobra Commander.

01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:41.285
Where can we find you, General?

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.730
Just need my orders.

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.810
You know, we'd make a hell of a team.
