THE GLORY

01:22.123 --> 01:24.834
OCTOBER 17TH

01:24.834 --> 01:26.586
It's too windy. What did you just say?

01:27.170 --> 01:30.882
<i>Your wife's friend, Son Myeong-o,
keeps calling you, Mr. Ha.</i>

01:31.508 --> 01:33.510
Who is? Son Myeong-o?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.388
Ah, shit.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.517
I can't remember anything
with this high wearing off. Shit.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.811
What was it?

01:44.604 --> 01:45.730
SON MYEONG-O

01:48.066 --> 01:48.900
What?

01:49.484 --> 01:51.236
What's up? I'm a little busy.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.322
<i>Where are you now?
Can we meet? Want to come over?</i>

01:54.322 --> 01:56.866
You want to meet up? Why?

01:56.866 --> 01:58.576
<i>Well, let's talk.</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:00.870
<i>I need to exchange some cash.
You have dollars, right?</i>

02:11.631 --> 02:12.924
<i>Hey, did you hear me?</i>

02:12.924 --> 02:13.925
Exchange?

02:13.925 --> 02:15.468
How much? Four dollars?

02:15.468 --> 02:18.596
Go fuck yourself.
I really don't have time for your shit.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.391
<i>Wow. You really are a little bitch.</i>

02:23.935 --> 02:25.270
What the fuck did you say?

02:25.270 --> 02:26.855
Ah, that's right.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.691
You probably wouldn't remember, would you?

02:30.191 --> 02:32.527
Down on all fours like a bitch.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.488
I'll make sure to send you
the video as my present.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.117
Now, you were there, right?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.201
When So-hee died.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.955
You ran without calling the cops,
even though you saw her fall?

02:44.539 --> 02:46.749
What the fuck? What're you talking about?

02:47.750 --> 02:50.545
Of course I didn't call the cops.
I was fucking high.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.464
I'm hanging up. I'm busy.
Quit bothering me.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.843
Wow, she's so shameless.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.303
Still her fault.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.559
OCTOBER 18

03:18.615 --> 03:22.619
JERKFACE JAE-JUN

03:22.619 --> 03:25.121
You like it, sir? Dear Mr. Jeon?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.707
You know, being bitten by your own dog?

03:27.707 --> 03:29.918
<i>You motherfucker, where are you?</i>

03:29.918 --> 03:32.128
Where else would I be? With you.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.297
You must be on something now.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.715
What did you send me?

03:35.715 --> 03:38.635
Record of your embezzlement.
You should know already.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.887
That account book
that shows where that money went

03:40.887 --> 03:43.056
instead of that golf course
in the Philippines.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.682
<i>So then I'll be quick.</i>

03:44.682 --> 03:47.727
I'll keep my mouth shut
for some of your crypto, man.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.312
For each page, one bitcoin.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.355
Son of a bitch.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.691
The market's killing me,
and you want what? You wanna die?

03:54.442 --> 03:56.861
Wow! I was just going to say that.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.530
Then, you remember the day
when So-hee died?

04:00.156 --> 04:02.242
You were Yeon-jin's alibi
that day, weren't you?

04:03.201 --> 04:05.912
What the hell
are you even saying now?

04:05.912 --> 04:08.790
<i>Moron. I've sent you
my crypto wallet address.</i>

04:08.790 --> 04:10.708
<i>You have 48 hours to send it.</i>

04:10.708 --> 04:13.962
<i>Ah, Jerkface Jae-jun.
You're not that tough, are you?</i>

04:13.962 --> 04:15.797
Hey. Hey!

04:15.797 --> 04:17.048
What the fuck?

04:28.017 --> 04:29.185
<i>What's up?</i>

04:29.185 --> 04:31.896
- Hey, it's your man, babe.
-<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

04:31.896 --> 04:32.814
HYE-JEONG

04:32.814 --> 04:35.275
Well, if you would like,
I can cum for you.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.611
So why don't we leave Korea right now?

04:38.611 --> 04:40.488
Oh wow. I'm so cute.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.324
Yeah, I know you're so fucking cute.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.993
That's why I'm saving you.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.538
Why'd you go to school
the day So-hee died? Huh?

04:49.038 --> 04:51.374
If you stay here in Korea,
you'll be a suspect.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.502
So let's leave, Hye-jeong.
Let's just go together.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.379
All the way to Russia.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.380
Heels.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.758
Why are you going to Russia?

05:01.426 --> 05:04.887
Ah. You finally decided to be a dog?
A little sled doggy?

05:04.887 --> 05:06.306
Fuck! Shit, man!

05:07.390 --> 05:10.143
I'm trying to get you
a first class ticket out of here!

05:10.143 --> 05:13.187
You're the only person
who knows my apartment's passcode!

05:13.771 --> 05:16.149
Don't you see
I'm in love with you? Don't you?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.945
I just got the chills.

05:20.945 --> 05:24.490
Oh! Gyeong-ran, do you have any fur coats?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.950
<i>I've called all of them.</i>

05:25.950 --> 05:26.868
OCTOBER 19

05:26.868 --> 05:29.871
<i>You should've seen them.
Not one of them batted an eye.</i>

05:29.871 --> 05:32.415
And Yeon-jin, too? Arranged a meeting?

05:32.415 --> 05:35.626
Well, actually,
I wanted to call you first.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.713
<i>She'll be the next person
I call after you.</i>

05:39.589 --> 05:40.590
So then,

05:41.924 --> 05:45.094
does this mean that you're including me
to the list of people you're calling?

05:45.094 --> 05:48.514
Wow, Dong-eun, you really are smart.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.434
You see, Dong-eun,
I haven't told them about you.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.686
<i>You know how they can be.</i>

05:53.686 --> 05:56.189
<i>Probably would just go
end you right on the spot.</i>

05:56.189 --> 05:57.357
<i>So I'll get to my point.</i>

05:57.357 --> 06:01.027
If you want to live a long life,
give me the name tag, Dong-eun.

06:11.245 --> 06:16.250
THE GLORY

06:18.503 --> 06:20.880
EDEN APARTMENTS

06:32.683 --> 06:34.769
It's funny running into you here.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.274
I didn't know
I should have brought you with.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.737
We could've carpooled. Right, dear?

06:53.121 --> 06:57.208
I need to leave some kind of sign
so that my friend knows I was here,

06:58.334 --> 06:59.877
but I haven't figured out how.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.091
So, tell me, honey,
what are you doing here?

07:06.467 --> 07:08.553
Did Dong-eun approach with some offering?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.515
Even if she did do that,
why would you come?

07:12.515 --> 07:13.599
What?

07:14.934 --> 07:19.272
You've been with me, so now you want
to know what it's like with a teacher?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.482
You're the one I'm curious about.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.156
The only main character here
is Park Yeon-jin.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.741
Why you?

07:47.592 --> 07:48.759
<i>I'll ask you once.</i>

07:50.219 --> 07:52.597
<i>If you don't answer me,
I'll ask someone else.</i>

07:53.097 --> 07:54.974
<i>Did you bully someone so much</i>

07:56.267 --> 07:58.102
that they tried to kill themselves?

07:58.936 --> 08:01.022
Did you verbally or physically

08:02.565 --> 08:03.566
abuse them?

08:05.943 --> 08:07.528
Do you want to know?

08:08.738 --> 08:09.822
Really know?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.745
Did Ms. Moon do anything to deserve that?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.580
Did she have to do anything?

08:19.707 --> 08:20.625
What'd you say?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.919
The idea that I bullied her is some story.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.214
It's just that we didn't like each other.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.468
I'm going to go now,

08:31.969 --> 08:33.471
so look all you want.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.568
Honey, today you're the one
who disappointed me,

08:48.152 --> 08:49.278
and not the other way.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.125
RAINBOW EYE CLINIC

10:18.367 --> 10:20.202
YOON SO-HEE

10:25.499 --> 10:27.793
What the hell were you thinking?

10:27.793 --> 10:30.379
Those bodies are not to be touched
without my permission.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.547
Are you out of your mind?

10:31.547 --> 10:34.300
I know that sir, but I thought maybe...

10:34.300 --> 10:36.218
Because he's the director's son...

10:37.428 --> 10:38.429
You're dismissed.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.520
You're Joo Yeo-jeong.
Maybe I can help you.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.522
That's me. I asked him to let me in.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.358
Do you have a minute to talk to me?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.654
So, Yoon So-hee's body's in the freezer?

10:56.781 --> 10:57.615
Yeah.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.161
Our records say she's in the morgue,
but her body's actually in the freezer.

11:02.161 --> 11:06.165
This information,
as you can understand, is confidential.

11:06.165 --> 11:10.503
Can you tell me,
why are you so interested in finding her?

11:10.503 --> 11:11.962
For personal reasons.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.591
Why did the hospital do this?

11:16.175 --> 11:18.844
What is the purpose of having
all of these security measures in place?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.847
The real purpose... I'm not sure.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.726
All I know is that the orders
came from the late director himself.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.482
From my father?

12:56.901 --> 12:58.778
Three-seven-two-four.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.910
I was so happy to see
that the lights were on.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.662
Were you waiting long? You should've
text me when you got here.

13:08.662 --> 13:09.830
I just got in.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.917
- It must've been a busy day for you.
- Not really.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.252
I had some business in Seoul.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.006
Actually, I got these blue towels for you.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.300
Pink's the only thing
that looks good on me.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.387
Wow, you're really checking right now?

13:26.013 --> 13:26.847
It does look good.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.974
You think so?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.770
I'm sorry, but I haven't prepared
the guest room yet.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.397
So you can sleep in my bed.
Tomorrow, we'll shop for yours.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.982
That's my room there.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.568
I ordered something, actually,
but it's not a bed.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.196
If I'm not here, then just leave it.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.656
I'll assemble it myself.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.866
So what did you order?

13:49.995 --> 13:52.832
The cops called and they want
an interview. What do I do?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.875
<i>What do you mean?
It's just an interview.</i>

13:54.875 --> 13:57.127
<i>Why? Did you kill Myeong-o?</i>

13:58.212 --> 13:59.296
You think I did, too?

14:00.339 --> 14:02.341
Fuck me. Did I kill him?

14:02.341 --> 14:04.510
Ah, what the hell are you on?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.141
I can't remember when I last saw him,

14:11.892 --> 14:13.477
or if we fought or we're good

14:13.477 --> 14:15.020
I have no fucking clue.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.899
Which is better?
Committing murder or doing drugs?

14:18.899 --> 14:21.819
Just think. You could
accidentally murder someone,

14:21.819 --> 14:25.656
<i>but can you accidentally take drugs?
That sounds kind of weird, right?</i>

14:25.656 --> 14:28.868
Hanging up.
You're fucking annoying, Sa-ra.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.620
<i>They call you too?
When's your interview? Mine's next week.</i>

14:31.620 --> 14:32.538
It's today.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.582
Guess he's here.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.250
<i>Come in!</i>

14:36.917 --> 14:37.835
Today?

14:37.835 --> 14:40.004
<i>No, wait. Hey, put me on speaker.</i>

14:40.004 --> 14:41.213
<i>No, wait. Record it.</i>

14:41.213 --> 14:42.756
<i>I'm gonna hurl...</i>

14:43.757 --> 14:45.342
Stop it, okay?

14:47.428 --> 14:48.429
Please, sit.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.433
I'm a very busy man.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.935
I don't have time for the police.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.771
That's okay.
It gives me an excuse to get out.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.357
I called earlier. Detective Choi.
Here's my card.

15:00.858 --> 15:01.692
Ah.

15:02.359 --> 15:05.779
Do you always look for missing adults?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.532
He's no longer a missing person.
It's now a criminal case.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.619
It seems Mr. Son
may have been involved with narcotics.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.288
Do you remember
the last time you saw Mr. Son?

15:14.872 --> 15:15.998
Not sure.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.833
Hasn't been to work in three weeks.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.253
He stopped coming to work?
That didn't concern you?

15:22.421 --> 15:26.592
Honestly, he stopped coming in
right as I was about to fire his ass.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.093
Such a shit employee.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.680
It's so hard to fire someone nowadays.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.223
Yeah, well.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.936
Do you remember
anything else that might be helpful?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.480
Did he meet with someone around that time?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.899
Huh. Before he was gone,

15:42.483 --> 15:44.985
there was someone who was
desperately looking around for him.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.904
And who was that?

15:49.239 --> 15:52.326
Jaepyeong Group's owner, Ha Do-yeong.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.621
He even gave me his business card.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.625
He had this kind of mad look there.

16:01.919 --> 16:02.836
I wonder why?

16:03.671 --> 16:06.465
<i>When it looks like
there's a second sun in the sky,</i>

16:06.465 --> 16:08.217
<i>we call it a sun dog.</i>

16:08.717 --> 16:12.096
<i>A sun dog is an event that is
created by the refraction of sunlight</i>

16:12.096 --> 16:15.140
<i>by ice crystals that are
floating around in the atmosphere.</i>

16:15.140 --> 16:18.811
<i>In Korean, this event is known as</i> murihae,
<i>meaning "many suns."</i>

16:18.811 --> 16:21.522
Depending how you look,
it could be two suns,

16:21.522 --> 16:23.107
or an illusion made by light.

16:23.774 --> 16:27.945
I hope you're all observing this unique
weather phenomenon that happened today.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.947
Park Yeon-jin, signing off.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.370
SA-RA

16:36.370 --> 16:39.498
<i>Jae-jun, how'd it go with the cop?
Any news on Myeong-o?</i>

16:42.793 --> 16:44.461
What's wrong? Huh?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.521
You could've asked for the passcode.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.940
That lock was expensive, Yeon-jin.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.608
Yeah, I should have.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.570
It was even more expensive to open it.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.572
Maybe I should rip open your mouth.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.575
Or break your hands that paid
some bastard to do your dirty work.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.035
What?

17:17.077 --> 17:20.164
Come on. I want a coffee. Do you?

17:53.405 --> 17:55.365
I really loved
seeing your home.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.742
Must've worked hard.

17:57.659 --> 18:00.329
Working at the factory,
passing exams, teaching.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.583
But you haven't upgraded your living?

18:06.251 --> 18:09.296
- Must've been difficult.
- I see you've done research.

18:12.049 --> 18:12.883
This bitch...

18:13.675 --> 18:14.843
You're the one to talk.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.846
Well, that was the only way.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.391
When I started this all,
I thought it'd be like <i>Taken.</i>

18:21.892 --> 18:23.811
But when things got going,

18:23.811 --> 18:25.479
I was following you all around.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.649
Had to fund the whole thing,
and even transferred schools.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.400
It's a lot of work.

18:30.984 --> 18:31.985
Just shut up.

18:33.070 --> 18:37.825
If you're really after revenge now,
you would've gone to the police station.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.954
All you're doing is rambling
because you have no proof.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.248
Well, try your best.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.250
With bullshit.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.752
You don't ever listen, do you?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.004
I said I've been busy.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.258
You see, I posted this online,

18:54.842 --> 18:56.593
but it didn't get many views...

18:56.593 --> 18:58.637
Maybe 'cause it lacks a subject?

19:08.605 --> 19:09.523
Post it.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.859
Make sure to include the subject.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.486
Whatever it is,
I have a million ways to explain.

19:15.070 --> 19:15.904
Really?

19:16.947 --> 19:20.075
But could you escape this too, then?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.329
INCIDENT REPORT

19:36.758 --> 19:37.593
MEDICAL RECORD

19:37.593 --> 19:39.720
DROPOUT FORM
MOON DONG-EUN

19:46.393 --> 19:48.020
I promise that I'll kill you.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.271
Wake up already.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.191
I should be the one killing you.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.775
You selfish bitch.

19:55.694 --> 20:00.115
I changed my mind a hundred times
on whether I would come or not.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.491
But I decided to do it.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.412
The reason I came to visit you today

20:06.163 --> 20:08.999
is to give you an opportunity
for one last chance.

20:08.999 --> 20:13.420
And I'm giving it because of the gesture
of kindness left by somebody at my door.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.798
What the hell are you saying?

20:16.798 --> 20:19.134
You go turn yourself in.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.803
Take these and give them to the police.

20:21.803 --> 20:25.057
Confess everything you did

20:25.057 --> 20:27.476
in order to cover up
the crimes you committed.

20:29.853 --> 20:30.687
Do what?

20:30.687 --> 20:32.522
If your punishment comes from me,

20:33.523 --> 20:35.442
it'll be a lot harsher, Yeon-jin.

20:35.442 --> 20:39.529
I promise, I will pay you back
for the 18 years of hell.

20:40.364 --> 20:44.326
You have to beg for forgiveness
from me and your other victims

20:44.326 --> 20:45.744
by turning yourself in.

20:45.744 --> 20:50.290
Then I'll put a stop to my revenge here.

20:51.875 --> 20:52.709
Wow.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.254
How nice of you, Dong-eun.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.714
Why would I do that?

20:58.215 --> 20:59.758
How would it just stop there?

21:00.801 --> 21:03.011
As soon as I go to the police,
it'll be in the news.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.680
And then, it would be all over.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.724
Trying to be smart, or what?

21:09.226 --> 21:11.728
Also, I think you've
misunderstood something.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.606
I didn't do anything wrong, Dong-eun.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.527
Nothing wrong? Really?

21:18.527 --> 21:19.695
Not at all.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.657
So you think
I made your life a living hell?

21:24.157 --> 21:26.493
That's just wrong.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.664
Your life has been hell
since the moment you were born.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.084
Honestly, you should be thanking me.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.711
Because of me, you teach.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.714
What's wrong, being the reason
that helped turn your life around?

21:40.215 --> 21:41.383
Forgiveness?

21:42.718 --> 21:44.386
Who forgives who?

21:44.970 --> 21:50.851
Why do the poor always believe
in things like poetic justice or karma?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.690
Even if I have to pull you apart,

21:57.441 --> 22:00.902
I promise I'll find
another straightener to use on you.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.072
Get lost.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.704
I really should thank you.

22:11.747 --> 22:14.499
Our meeting here has
completely erased all my guilt.

22:16.084 --> 22:18.837
Actually, I think it's nice
to see you like this.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.966
That expression there tells me
you're struggling, so good luck.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.553
This was your last chance,

22:27.596 --> 22:30.474
and you just threw away
the lifeline your husband got you.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.463
<i>It turns out
I have a secret love child.</i>

23:02.047 --> 23:04.132
Have you had something taken from you?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.602
He went missing?

23:16.311 --> 23:17.396
Son Myeong-o?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.313
Yes.

23:18.897 --> 23:22.692
The Jongno police want to interview you
about his disappearance.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.445
I'm sorry sir,

23:26.196 --> 23:30.033
but Son Myeong-o asked me
to give you something.

23:30.617 --> 23:31.785
Here.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.259
<i>Ms. Secretary,</i>

23:47.259 --> 23:51.805
<i>I have information on the motherfucker
that has been fucking your boss' wife.</i>

23:51.805 --> 23:53.765
<i>So tell your boss
if he doesn't want to see</i>

23:53.765 --> 23:55.851
<i>this guy's name
plastered all over the internet,</i>

23:55.851 --> 23:57.102
<i>he should call me soon.</i>

24:26.882 --> 24:28.008
Okay.

24:32.888 --> 24:33.805
Oh my God!

24:35.891 --> 24:36.892
Hey there.

24:38.935 --> 24:42.439
Uh, I just wanted
to look inside, I swear. Uh...

24:42.439 --> 24:45.901
"Don't assemble it," I told myself.
"Don't do it." But the manuals...

24:45.901 --> 24:48.236
I mean, I used to be a Boy Scout,
but I swore I wouldn't--

24:48.236 --> 24:51.031
Why didn't you assemble this
on the second floor?

24:51.531 --> 24:55.035
Or did you not consider it'll be
much harder to move once it's built?

24:56.620 --> 24:57.704
Ah, that's right.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.128
Huh. You're right. Totally.

25:06.379 --> 25:09.007
- No problem. Let's just leave it here.
- I don't want to impose.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.134
Let's move it after we eat.

25:12.385 --> 25:13.220
Dessert.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.060
Whoa! Roasted sweet potatoes
are my favorite.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.605
- You said noodles were your favorite.
- Wow.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.565
They are. This is my second-favorite.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.365
Welcome home.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.783
This is the real one.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.395
<i>Look at these sparkling walls.</i>

26:04.271 --> 26:06.147
<i>Not yellowed by cigarette smoke</i>

26:06.815 --> 26:08.483
<i>or infected with mold.</i>

26:09.568 --> 26:13.238
<i>You can't find hatred in these walls.</i>

26:16.533 --> 26:18.285
How unfamiliar.

27:03.913 --> 27:07.375
<i>How about your walls?
Are they still shiny and sturdy?</i>

27:08.335 --> 27:09.336
<i>Yeon-jin?</i>

27:27.937 --> 27:30.398
Sit here. Next to the fire to stay warm.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.485
Use this.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.988
Do we have to eat out here in the cold?

27:36.988 --> 27:40.158
Well, this is why I decided on
a house with a yard.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.159
Isn't it romantic?

27:41.159 --> 27:45.121
The only thing I think
when I see houses like this one

27:45.121 --> 27:48.166
is that the heating
and the electricity bill must be insane

27:48.166 --> 27:49.959
if they have them running all the time.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.756
I'll pay my share,
but we're not splitting them in half.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.341
'Cause, if we do that,

27:56.341 --> 27:58.176
then I'll turn everything off.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.094
Jeez.

28:00.136 --> 28:00.970
I got it.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.224
They're just for today, then.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.396
Here. Dip it in there.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.820
When did you learn how to do this?

28:18.071 --> 28:19.239
Uh, I guess

28:20.824 --> 28:23.243
I learned how to this morning. Uh...

28:25.370 --> 28:28.790
Well, I looked up ideas
for some romantic dinners.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.503
Thank you for this.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.841
If this is really that important to you,

28:38.550 --> 28:40.051
then let's try being romantic.

28:41.386 --> 28:42.220
For real?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.557
- Should I play some music?
- No.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.601
I can just sing for you then.
Ah, check.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.770
Can I take back what I just said?

28:50.770 --> 28:53.106
No.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.609
One, two, three. One, two, three.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.362
Oh no.

28:59.362 --> 29:00.447
I'm feeling ill.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.699
I might have a fever.

29:03.616 --> 29:04.617
I'll go in.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.120
Let's see.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.846
In my professional opinion,

29:25.930 --> 29:26.848
you're faking it.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.561
Did you really have to check right away?

29:34.814 --> 29:35.899
I'll let you off now.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.319
You're missing out.
I can sing like a bird.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.409
Thank you for taking me in.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.871
You must've been surprised and confused.

29:50.371 --> 29:53.374
It was the right thing to do for you.

30:01.716 --> 30:02.550
Drugs?

30:03.051 --> 30:05.512
It's now a drug investigation
instead of a missing persons?

30:06.095 --> 30:07.180
Fuck me!

30:07.847 --> 30:10.517
I knew this would fucking happen! Damn it!

30:11.267 --> 30:13.561
Shit. Look what you've done.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.647
This is all because you called the cops.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.233
- You're such a fucking bitch.
- Let go! My hair!

30:18.233 --> 30:20.819
Maybe you shouldn't have become
a drug addict in the first place!

30:20.819 --> 30:22.403
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I'll fucking kill you!

30:22.987 --> 30:26.366
I get you're going through withdrawal,
but it's your fault you took them.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.743
- Fuck!
- It's about time you realize that.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.286
Ah, shit!

30:33.623 --> 30:35.375
Guys, we can't do this right now.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.920
Moon Dong-eun is really coming after us.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.464
DROPOUT FORM

30:41.464 --> 30:42.465
INCIDENT REPORT

30:43.967 --> 30:45.051
What's this?

30:45.051 --> 30:46.553
What do you think, huh?

30:47.428 --> 30:49.556
Evidence from when
we bullied her in high school.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.140
How is that my problem?

30:52.141 --> 30:55.353
You're the only one
who'll be affected by the scandal.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.775
I don't give a shit about any of this.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.446
I'm only asking
'cause it's been bothering me.

31:05.446 --> 31:07.365
Did Myeong-o ask any of you about So-hee?

31:10.702 --> 31:11.619
You too?

31:12.745 --> 31:15.039
You too? Oh wow...

31:15.039 --> 31:17.375
He asked me why I went
to So-hee's school that day.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.210
So he called each of us?

31:20.211 --> 31:21.421
And now he's missing?

31:21.421 --> 31:24.090
Ah, I almost told him

31:24.883 --> 31:27.093
that Yeon-jin was the one
who asked me to go.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.264
What are you trying to say now, Hye-jeong?

31:31.264 --> 31:33.683
I spent that entire day with Jae-jun.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.603
Back then, we were
all unfairly investigated.

31:37.353 --> 31:39.188
Haven't we all agreed on that?

31:39.981 --> 31:41.649
So then it's "we" now?

31:44.193 --> 31:47.864
<i>Well in this situation,
your best scenario won't be a lawsuit.</i>

31:47.864 --> 31:49.657
<i>It's the mother getting a divorce.</i>

31:52.619 --> 31:54.370
Remind me where that was again?

31:55.830 --> 31:57.206
With me?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.919
We were in the movie room

32:01.544 --> 32:03.630
watching some naughty movies together.

32:04.547 --> 32:05.548
Ah.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.593
We were like that, huh?

32:10.178 --> 32:11.679
You expect us to believe that?

32:11.679 --> 32:13.389
No one's willing to say it,

32:13.389 --> 32:15.183
but you're the one
who did something to So-hee.

32:15.183 --> 32:16.100
Sa-ra.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.812
I think you should shut up now.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.648
Be careful.

32:22.690 --> 32:23.524
So then,

32:24.233 --> 32:26.569
what did Myeong-o have to say to you?

32:26.569 --> 32:28.738
What did he ask you about So-hee?

32:53.179 --> 32:54.847
You all really have lost it.

33:00.603 --> 33:01.771
Go screw yourselves.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.087
It's me, Mr. Shin.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.798
Remember my name tag back then?

33:34.679 --> 33:37.598
TO THE DETECTIVE
IN CHARGE OF YOON SO-HEE'S CASE

33:38.725 --> 33:40.852
COMPLAINT BOX

33:44.981 --> 33:47.984
Any idea how hard a membership
for the Western CC is?

33:47.984 --> 33:51.029
Hey, I didn't win this
in just any gambling match, either.

33:54.574 --> 33:55.450
How'd you wrap it up?

33:55.450 --> 33:57.744
It was deemed nothing more than a suicide.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.498
You know, if you didn't do well in school,

34:02.498 --> 34:05.376
I swear your face would be
all over the society columns.

34:07.336 --> 34:08.671
PARK YEON-JIN

34:09.255 --> 34:10.423
I should burn this.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.175
It's bad luck.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.762
Back then, I was far too naive.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.931
I thought they would
reopen the investigation

34:18.931 --> 34:20.933
if additional evidence was discovered,

34:20.933 --> 34:22.351
but nothing ever happened.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.481
Even the name tag wasn't
in the evidence list.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.067
Then the name tag you had wasn't real.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.986
So why did you tell Mr. Son
that you had it?

34:31.986 --> 34:34.864
Because Myeong-o didn't know
it wasn't real.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.826
I just needed some bait
to get him to start swimming.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.413
Where exactly did you want Mr. Son to go?

34:44.373 --> 34:45.458
To Yeon-jin.

34:46.209 --> 34:47.043
Hmm.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.214
You've been repeating yourself
this entire time.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.715
The weather reporter, Park Yeon-jin,

34:52.715 --> 34:55.218
was somehow involved
in Mr. Son's disappearance,

34:55.218 --> 34:58.721
but you have no evidence
to support this claim. Am I right?

34:59.722 --> 35:03.226
I have to give you the proof too?
After I turned in this report?

35:03.226 --> 35:05.937
Ninety-nine percent
of reports like these are lies.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.315
And defamation is a very serious crime.

35:10.566 --> 35:14.695
Now, all I want to know is
if Mr. Son had anything to do with drugs.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.447
Do you know anything about that?

35:18.449 --> 35:19.784
I'll think about it.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.954
All I want to know is,
do you know something or not?

35:22.954 --> 35:25.998
I don't know if this is defamation or not,

35:25.998 --> 35:27.500
so I'll think about it.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.837
After all, I shouldn't commit
such a serious crime.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.510
And what about the name tag?

35:38.469 --> 35:40.096
Didn't they send it to you then?

35:40.680 --> 35:44.016
If it was dropped off at the station,
there has to be a witness.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.103
Did you even try
and conduct an investigation?

35:50.439 --> 35:52.358
You're mad I wasn't investigating?

35:52.900 --> 35:55.361
You're asking me why I didn't
make your problem even bigger?

35:55.361 --> 35:57.697
Do you want me to really live in fear?

35:58.614 --> 36:00.032
What if they turn themselves in?

36:00.825 --> 36:01.951
After all this time?

36:02.910 --> 36:04.996
You said it. They were anonymous.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.540
If they were going to show up,
they would've done it back then.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.458
But what if there's more evidence?

36:10.126 --> 36:12.628
What if the witness
suddenly goes crazy now

36:12.628 --> 36:15.047
and decides they need
to be a hero tomorrow?

36:20.803 --> 36:22.221
It's been 18 years.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.183
Your mother got rid of
the name tag long ago.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.475
Only the corpse remains.

36:26.475 --> 36:29.520
And that corpse has been
in the mortuary, rotting away.

36:29.520 --> 36:33.774
Even if they were to reinvestigate,
the case is already ruled as a suicide.

36:35.818 --> 36:39.697
Even if they somehow came back to life,
there's no way anyone can overturn it!

36:43.159 --> 36:45.411
You're right. That's true, right?

36:46.287 --> 36:48.623
That's exactly what I wanted
to hear from you.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.794
Oh, and where's that motel you bought?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.631
That one? Or is it that one?

36:58.257 --> 36:59.091
That's it.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.845
Thank you for finding out about the car.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.164
Don't.

37:30.665 --> 37:34.418
He'll just beat you up if you go in there.
There's no point confronting him.

37:35.127 --> 37:37.129
He bought himself four bottles of soju.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.298
He won't fall asleep for a while.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.201
Oh, Sun-a.

38:07.785 --> 38:10.121
How are you so bright and beautiful,

38:10.955 --> 38:13.374
even though you grew up
in a place so awful?

38:13.874 --> 38:15.960
You remember the thing I hate the most?

38:17.378 --> 38:18.212
Tear jokes.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.089
Tearjerkers.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.259
Yeah, that's right.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.431
I'm sorry.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.560
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.146
There's nothing to be sorry about.

38:36.939 --> 38:38.190
Don't cry, Mom.

38:40.359 --> 38:42.028
None of this is your fault.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.947
You're doing the best you can every day.

38:48.034 --> 38:48.868
Sun-a...

38:51.787 --> 38:52.621
Do you...

38:54.206 --> 38:55.207
want to...

38:56.500 --> 38:57.501
go somewhere that's...

38:59.128 --> 39:00.087
far from here?

39:01.213 --> 39:02.214
To study?

39:03.883 --> 39:06.969
The US isn't that far.
It's not like I'd be walking there.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.764
Promise you'll come join me soon?

39:10.639 --> 39:12.641
Mm-hmm. Of course.

39:12.641 --> 39:13.601
Really soon.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.439
You can go first.
Then Ms. Moon and I will follow you.

39:19.523 --> 39:23.527
You can go to school there.
Start cheerleading, even.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.821
Maybe date the football quarterback too.

39:26.655 --> 39:27.615
Are you okay?

39:28.199 --> 39:29.784
What movies are you watching?

39:40.461 --> 39:45.049
<i>In Chinese,
Sun-a's name means "kind" and "bright."</i>

39:45.883 --> 39:47.468
<i>I chose her name myself.</i>

39:48.803 --> 39:51.138
<i>Maybe her life's hard
'cause I didn't pick the right name.</i>

39:51.138 --> 39:52.515
KANG HYEON-NAM

39:52.515 --> 39:55.434
<i>Maybe I should have
paid someone to name her.</i>

39:56.352 --> 40:00.815
<i>But in the US, Sun-a will get
a new English name, won't she?</i>

40:01.399 --> 40:04.235
<i>That's all I need.</i>

40:04.777 --> 40:06.195
<i>That's all I need, Ms. Moon.</i>

40:07.321 --> 40:09.323
BEWARE OF INFECTION

40:14.328 --> 40:15.329
Wow, four hours?

40:15.329 --> 40:16.539
OPERATION TIME

40:16.539 --> 40:18.124
Still in the game, Doctor.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.751
He was in a car accident.
I was trying to stop the bleeding.

40:22.294 --> 40:25.256
What's up? You didn't even call ahead.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.257
Need more money?

40:26.257 --> 40:29.176
Hey, not that. I'm here for business.

40:29.176 --> 40:31.178
What business do you have in my hospital?

40:31.762 --> 40:32.721
I've got some with you.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.640
I've missed you, Mom.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.768
You'll get blood on you!

40:37.768 --> 40:40.521
- So?
- Ugh. You ran out of money.

40:46.318 --> 40:47.403
Hey, so Mom,

40:48.571 --> 40:51.490
if I took my scalpel
and used it as an executioner's sword,

40:52.575 --> 40:53.909
would you try to stop me?

40:58.372 --> 40:59.457
What are you saying?

41:00.040 --> 41:03.669
What if I made
a different choice than Dad?

41:07.381 --> 41:10.634
The person who I like
went through something horrible.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.888
And I want to help her get her revenge.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.934
Because I was bored.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.395
So your poor son
really went to hell, right?

41:24.023 --> 41:25.024
That asshole.

41:27.151 --> 41:30.738
He's a rapist.
He assaulted people and murdered them.

41:32.698 --> 41:35.534
But he still tried to save him,
like any other patient.

41:38.537 --> 41:39.538
Your father...

41:43.709 --> 41:44.877
was a very good man.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.630
So kind and warm-hearted.

41:48.714 --> 41:49.548
But then,

41:50.841 --> 41:54.053
blindly acting with good intentions
only brings false glory.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.471
Nothing more.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.227
I always thought
you took after your father,

42:01.227 --> 42:02.686
but now I see I was wrong.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.188
You're more like me.

42:08.442 --> 42:09.401
You wanna help her?

42:13.489 --> 42:14.657
Then keep it secret.

42:16.158 --> 42:18.285
If this is what you really want to do,

42:19.578 --> 42:21.121
I'm not going to stop you.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.170
No one will know.

42:29.922 --> 42:30.923
Here you go.

42:31.590 --> 42:34.260
So Yeon-jin really broke into your house?

42:35.177 --> 42:36.136
Oh my God.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.721
Did she take anything?

42:37.721 --> 42:40.224
What do I have
that she'd want to steal from me?

42:40.975 --> 42:43.227
I only asked for your help
'cause I was worried about this.

42:43.852 --> 42:45.020
Really? What is it?

42:45.771 --> 42:47.856
So-hee's incident report.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.985
This is the reason
why I shared everything with Myeong-o.

42:53.279 --> 42:55.281
But how did you get your hands on this?

43:08.460 --> 43:11.380
WINTER OF 2011

43:15.551 --> 43:16.802
DO YOU KNOW SO-HEE?

43:18.387 --> 43:19.722
MY DAUGHTER, YOON SO-HEE?

43:19.722 --> 43:20.848
DECEASED: YOON SO-HEE

43:20.848 --> 43:23.350
PLEASE READ THIS
I'M BEGGING YOU

43:23.350 --> 43:26.395
NOBODY LISTENS TO ME

43:26.395 --> 43:30.232
DO YOU KNOW PARK YEON-JIN?
DO YOU KNOW SON MYEONG-O?

43:30.232 --> 43:31.984
THEY KILLED MY DAUGHTER

43:31.984 --> 43:33.736
NO ONE CAN HELP ME

43:33.736 --> 43:37.615
DO YOU KNOW JEON JAE-JUN?
LEE SA-RA? CHOI HYE-JEONG?

43:37.615 --> 43:43.120
MISS, PLEASE READ THIS

43:46.123 --> 43:48.417
This is the autopsy report
for Yoon So-hee.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.461
It was performed here.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.545
EIGHT WEEKS INTO PREGNANCY

43:52.546 --> 43:53.422
Yoon So-hee

43:54.882 --> 43:56.216
was eight week pregnant.

43:56.216 --> 43:58.469
So-hee was pregnant?

43:59.094 --> 43:59.928
Yeah.

44:00.638 --> 44:04.725
That's why I asked them
to get the incident report for me.

44:04.725 --> 44:08.896
I want to bring So-hee back home.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.901
I'm going to get it for her.
I'm avenging her.

44:16.195 --> 44:19.782
I think that may be why I'm still alive.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.369
So many times I have wanted to die.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.415
You won't believe me,

44:29.416 --> 44:32.836
but I feel So-hee
was helping me fall asleep.

44:35.714 --> 44:38.050
Because she's with me, I feel strong now.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.219
I just...

44:44.973 --> 44:46.558
You poor thing, Dong-eun.

44:49.061 --> 44:51.397
I feel horrible for you and So-hee.

45:16.505 --> 45:20.008
<i>If you want a long life,
give me the name tag, Dong-eun.</i>

45:21.343 --> 45:23.345
I guess we're not
in the same boat anymore.

45:23.345 --> 45:24.763
<i>What else can I do?</i>

45:24.763 --> 45:26.181
That ship's totally off-course.

45:26.849 --> 45:29.017
So think carefully, Dong-eun.

45:29.017 --> 45:31.520
What if I decide to switch teams on you?

45:32.438 --> 45:33.772
I mean, even for you...

45:34.398 --> 45:35.899
the odds are one against four.

45:37.109 --> 45:39.361
I mean, they're all murderers.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.281
Those four killed So-hee.

45:42.781 --> 45:44.825
The only one innocent is me, right?

45:44.825 --> 45:46.285
You think you're innocent?

45:47.202 --> 45:48.203
Come on now.

45:49.288 --> 45:50.372
What am I guilty of?

45:50.372 --> 45:52.958
A sin that warrants being ripped apart.

45:53.625 --> 45:55.419
Don't forget,
I've already fought five to one.

45:57.129 --> 45:58.297
So good luck.

46:00.424 --> 46:02.050
Hey! You fucking bitch.

46:02.551 --> 46:03.552
How annoying.

46:05.804 --> 46:07.890
Ah, shit. Damn it.

46:09.141 --> 46:12.686
No, wait. I just need
Yeon-jin to take the bait.

46:22.571 --> 46:23.822
I have been

46:23.822 --> 46:26.492
<i>thinking about you non-stop all day long.</i>

46:27.242 --> 46:28.327
<i>Wanna meet up later?</i>

46:28.911 --> 46:31.830
<i>I have something
I really want to talk to you about.</i>

46:31.830 --> 46:33.665
<i>If you don't me with me today,</i>

46:33.665 --> 46:36.335
then I will just meet you
at your work tomorrow.

46:39.421 --> 46:40.672
Now I'm curious.

46:41.924 --> 46:43.258
Why do you want to meet?

46:46.386 --> 46:48.347
I'm with friends, so I can't right now.

46:51.433 --> 46:52.684
So around 11:00?

47:13.580 --> 47:14.581
YEONGSAN FUNERAL HOME

48:21.481 --> 48:23.859
PARK YEON-JIN

48:54.306 --> 48:55.390
May I help you?

48:56.767 --> 48:57.601
Get out, lady.

48:59.144 --> 49:00.979
I think you've got the wrong person.

49:02.230 --> 49:03.398
I don't think I do.

49:11.657 --> 49:12.908
Kang Hyeon-nam, right?

49:13.992 --> 49:15.994
Knock it off and get out now.
