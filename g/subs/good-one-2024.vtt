00:43.913 --> 00:45.480
[water rushing]

01:00.364 --> 01:02.410
[upbeat guitar tune]

01:21.777 --> 01:24.301
[flute playing a calm tune]

01:25.215 --> 01:27.174
[birds chirping]

01:44.800 --> 01:46.149
[muffled thunder]

01:50.806 --> 01:52.112
[crickets chirping]

02:01.643 --> 02:03.123
[distant siren]

02:06.387 --> 02:08.345
[child chattering
indistinctly]

02:10.565 --> 02:12.914
[woman] I know. I see it.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.916
- I see it.
- Hey, mummy!

02:14.917 --> 02:17.137
What's that for?

02:18.399 --> 02:20.617
- Filtering water.
- Uh-huh.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.490
And that?

02:24.013 --> 02:26.580
That's to dig a hole
to burry your shit.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.234
- No.
- Yeah.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.713
That's disgusting.

02:29.714 --> 02:33.195
Glad to know you care
about what I'm doing.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.892
- Chris.
- That's a headlamp.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.807
Which is also a flashlight.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.418
No, it's a little flashlight.

02:38.419 --> 02:40.463
It's, like, little.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.552
How many lights do you need?

02:42.553 --> 02:45.555
- Did you wash these?
- I washed the things
you told me to.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.427
But were these
with the things?

02:47.428 --> 02:50.734
You have no idea how much
preparation this takes.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.389
Wash them in a river
if you have to.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.784
- Jesse!
- Yeah?

02:58.003 --> 03:00.310
Can you get me a tampon?
That drawer.

03:05.402 --> 03:06.577
Thank you.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.813
How is it not going
to get smooshed?

03:25.814 --> 03:29.905
Because my dehydrated
peanut butter is going
to work as a cushion.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.174
[alarm clock beeps]

04:02.024 --> 04:03.547
Come on! Come on, come one.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.767
What?

04:07.029 --> 04:09.292
[upbeat music continues]

04:12.948 --> 04:14.210
[sighs]

04:19.259 --> 04:20.260
Alright?

04:27.092 --> 04:28.442
[cheers]

04:29.965 --> 04:31.619
- We love this!
- Dad...

04:34.012 --> 04:35.318
- It's great.
- Come on.

04:57.471 --> 04:58.820
[music fades]

05:07.394 --> 05:08.656
Hey.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.135
Get in the back.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.269
- What?
- Can you get in the back?

05:14.705 --> 05:16.750
Why do I have
to go in the back?

05:16.751 --> 05:18.796
Because I'm
asking you so nicely.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.203
Three weeks ago
you said you were gonna go!

05:35.204 --> 05:37.858
Sam's going. Everybody's
ready to go but you.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.425
Yeah. Cause I'm...

05:39.426 --> 05:41.341
[raised voices]

05:44.431 --> 05:46.302
I don't care! Go without me.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.435
I'm fine, I'm fine!

05:51.438 --> 05:53.047
- Hey!
- Little shit!

05:53.048 --> 05:55.092
- You want me to...?
- No, leave it.

05:55.093 --> 05:58.358
I don't wanna look at his
ugly little face this weekend.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.838
[loud drilling]

06:16.114 --> 06:17.506
- Are you sure?
- Just drive.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.465
- Is Dylan not coming?
- No.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.511
- Do you want me to try?
- No, no.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.644
Let's just go.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.777
Stephanie's gonna
fucking love this.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.433
[radio plays a gentle song]

06:42.706 --> 06:45.055
- God.
- You want me to drive?

06:45.056 --> 06:47.449
- Not really.
- Watch out for this guy.

06:47.450 --> 06:51.366
I see him. Got the two eyes.
They're going this way.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.935
That scaffolding
has been there for 14 years.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.023
I'm not kidding.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.547
It's not cheap
to have that up.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.332
- You want this down?
- No. Can you...?

07:01.333 --> 07:02.682
Okay. Do you want it up?

07:02.683 --> 07:05.425
Yeah. It's, like
going in my face.

07:07.775 --> 07:08.732
Thank you.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.953
- Matt...
- There's a glitch. Sorry.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.608
Stop!

07:15.609 --> 07:17.827
- Thank you.
- Some sort of wiring thing.

07:17.828 --> 07:20.395
- Sure.
- Something with the wires.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.223
Oh, there it goes.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.052
[calm guitar music]

07:47.510 --> 07:49.555
How many miles a day?

07:49.556 --> 07:51.862
Divided up,
it should be eight or nine.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.127
Have we done that much before?

07:57.128 --> 07:59.129
Well, it's all about
the terrain.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.482
We have done the mileage, like
we did on the Mirror trail.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.222
Remember?

08:04.875 --> 08:07.486
So go pick him up!

08:07.487 --> 08:09.750
Well, then tell him
to take the subway!

08:12.535 --> 08:13.493
I don't care.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.538
Good luck with that.

08:16.452 --> 08:17.497
Fuck.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.151
[calm music continues]

08:40.258 --> 08:41.998
20.92.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.522
3.99 on sale. You want one?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.524
Matt, no. Put it all back.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.047
The umbrella
will stay in the car.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.570
The rest is for tonight.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.399
You seriously need
16 ounces of jalapeno cheese?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.922
- Yeah, I might.
- I got it.

08:52.923 --> 08:56.753
No, I got it. I just booked
an IBS commercial, so...

08:57.493 --> 08:59.015
You want some gum?

08:59.016 --> 09:00.582
No. I'm good.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.889
You need to learn
to indulge yourself.

09:02.890 --> 09:06.066
Your dad likes to deny himself
the simple pleasures in life.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.807
Because. I don't know, he's...

09:07.808 --> 09:09.896
A pleasure for me
is to not carry around

09:09.897 --> 09:12.725
a bunch of useless food
that has no nutritional value.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.989
- This is, like, an ounce.
- [sings] Ounces make pounds.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.557
[calm music continues]

09:31.788 --> 09:33.354
Divorce is a lot of work.

09:33.355 --> 09:36.792
But marriage was work
and divorce was the fun part.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.447
It's all work and compromise.

09:39.448 --> 09:40.883
[laughs]

09:40.884 --> 09:43.059
Tell me about one time
you've compromised.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.584
That's the problem.
April and I didn't compromise.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.020
That's why we're divorced.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.588
Casey does
all your compromising for you.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.677
Some marriages
are easier than others.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.461
I need a Casey.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.941
You've got to figure it out,

09:54.942 --> 09:56.551
make the old
work with the new.

09:56.552 --> 09:59.119
I gave her the apartment.
I didn't have to do that.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.121
I mean,
she's living in the apartment.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.992
His life's basically unchanged

10:02.993 --> 10:07.083
because I'm bending over
backwards to make sure of it.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.520
What the fuck
is he so angry about?

10:09.521 --> 10:11.480
His parents'
relationship ending?

10:12.002 --> 10:13.655
Oh, hello.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.614
Are you eavesdropping on us
back there?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.180
I'm literally a
a foot away from you.

10:17.181 --> 10:19.052
Then why don't
you weigh in?

10:19.053 --> 10:20.880
- On what?
- On my dilemma.

10:20.881 --> 10:24.100
- What's your dilemma?
- That everyone's mad at me.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.320
Sure, it's more
complicated than that.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.365
I don't know.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.324
Yeah, I guess.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.457
I don't know, maybe
you should think about

10:33.458 --> 10:34.937
how it's complicated,

10:34.938 --> 10:38.506
like, specifically
for Stephanie and Dylan.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.639
And then you won't have
a dilemma anymore.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.944
Just fix it.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.467
I'm just saying,
think about it

10:43.468 --> 10:44.991
from everyone's perspective.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.775
That's all I do.
I try to figure out

10:46.776 --> 10:47.994
what they're thinking.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.431
Dad, can I drive? I'm carsick.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.521
You're sick
because you're texting.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.436
Dad.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.829
[notification sound]
Shit.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.440
Can you check that, Sammy.

10:59.615 --> 11:00.616
Better check.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.357
Sharon said,

11:03.358 --> 11:05.577
"Did the approvals
come through?"

11:07.405 --> 11:09.580
Text her that I spoke
to my guy at the city.

11:09.581 --> 11:10.712
We expect the approvals

11:10.713 --> 11:12.540
on the Tuesday
after the holiday.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.456
"My guy at the city..."

11:18.982 --> 11:21.375
- Okay.
- What'd she say?

11:21.376 --> 11:23.421
I don't know, I just sent it.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.598
Okay. She's typing.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.644
Uh-huh.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.340
She said,

11:30.341 --> 11:32.734
"Construction must
start by Tuesday."

11:32.735 --> 11:34.823
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Alright.

11:34.824 --> 11:35.825
Uh...

11:38.175 --> 11:39.610
Just tell her,

11:39.611 --> 11:43.310
"The work will be completed
on the agreed upon date."

11:43.311 --> 11:44.616
It's kind of cold.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.706
Well, what would you say?

11:47.707 --> 11:49.317
I don't know, like...

11:51.319 --> 11:52.581
"Even if we don't...

11:54.496 --> 11:56.192
Even if we
aren't able to meet..."

11:56.193 --> 11:58.281
You can't just roll over
for these women.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.935
They'll keep asking
for the next thing.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.894
What do you mean,
"these women"?

12:01.895 --> 12:03.069
How stupid is it.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.505
This outdoor kitchen that is

12:04.506 --> 12:06.333
three feet from
her indoor kitchen.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.074
Can you just call her?

12:08.075 --> 12:10.599
- I'm driving.
- Okay, let me drive.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.863
Text her, "Roger that."

12:16.257 --> 12:19.042
- R, O, G, E...
- Yeah, I got it.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.308
Sent it.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.184
[grunts]

12:36.016 --> 12:37.277
You could have
left the umbrella.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.366
Yeah.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.978
You didn't tell me that
we were sharing a room.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.153
Oh, God.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.460
You'll survive.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.693
[sighs]

13:14.054 --> 13:18.144
It was the biggest smile
that her plastic surgery
would allow.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.668
- Like this?
- Like that.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.498
Oh, here it is.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.065
Alright. You've got some cod.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.153
Thank you.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.633
And a couple of burgers.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.418
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

13:31.419 --> 13:32.812
- Another beer?
- Yeah.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.423
Same.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.651
I don't think I've ever seen
you eat this much.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.305
This is a regular
amount of food.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.959
I didn't know you ate meat.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.613
I thought you
were a vegetarian.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.093
I eat meat at lunch.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.137
Really?

13:55.138 --> 13:56.791
I've never been
a vegetarian, Dad.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.924
You seem like one, though.
Don't you think?

13:58.925 --> 14:01.187
- Sort of. Yeah.
- Just a little bit?

14:01.188 --> 14:02.753
- No.
- Slight...?

14:02.754 --> 14:05.582
- No.
- A shading of vegetarianism.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.715
- No.
- No?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.025
Get your own.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.246
Fair trade.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.644
I don't want your frozen fish.

14:23.645 --> 14:24.950
You'll be dreaming of it

14:24.951 --> 14:27.561
after three days
of powdered peanut butter.

14:27.562 --> 14:31.695
I like the peanut butter.
It's good. I put it in my
smoothies and stuff.

14:31.696 --> 14:35.004
- Jesse's addicted, too.
- Who's Jesse?
Your lady friend?

14:39.139 --> 14:40.748
You have a little
food on your lip.

14:40.749 --> 14:41.923
She's my friend.

14:41.924 --> 14:42.925
What's her deal?

14:45.710 --> 14:46.798
Um.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.584
She's going to NYU next year
for photography.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.891
You're lucky, man.
This one likes girls.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.371
Boys are fucked up.

14:55.372 --> 14:58.070
You should see
Dylan's browser history.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.551
The internet is a dark place.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.945
I tried to tell him that.

15:03.946 --> 15:07.428
The search terms are
from a fucking horror movie.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.955
I wish we were four,

15:13.956 --> 15:15.479
but three will do.

15:24.358 --> 15:25.881
[eerie chiming music]

15:56.868 --> 15:57.869
[coughs]

16:03.092 --> 16:04.050
[laughs]

16:05.051 --> 16:06.095
Eww!

16:08.054 --> 16:09.229
This was today?

16:14.930 --> 16:16.062
Jesse!

17:04.806 --> 17:07.590
- Miércoles is Wednesday.
- Right.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.202
Sábado is Saturday.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.508
- Yeah.
- What is Monday?

17:12.509 --> 17:15.685
- Lunes?
- Lunes. Is martes Tuesday?

17:15.686 --> 17:18.906
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Lunes, martes, miércoles.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.604
- Thursday...
- Viernes Is Friday, right?

17:21.605 --> 17:24.651
Yeah. Sabado.
Is domingo Sunday?

17:24.652 --> 17:26.305
Domingo. Yeah, maybe domingo.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.742
We have six out of seven.
That's not fucking bad.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.440
[eerie music continues]

18:25.495 --> 18:26.583
We're leaving.

18:44.601 --> 18:45.776
[door squeaks]

18:51.608 --> 18:56.046
Okay, so on this curve,
just easy.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.788
- Easy.
- I'm taking them easy.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.008
Yeah, yeah.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.490
It's just sometimes
it doesn't feel easy.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.406
I'm just driving.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.277
Okay, slow
down a little bit.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.149
I'm going the speed limit.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.715
You're actually
going five miles over.

19:12.716 --> 19:16.023
I'm not. And you always
go at least ten over.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.417
That is my
privilege as father.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.070
She's a better
driver than you, man.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.985
That's because
I taught her.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.596
Thank you, Matt.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.164
Take a left up here.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.658
[birds chirping]

20:26.137 --> 20:27.138
Okay.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.271
Damn! That's heavy.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.969
- You're joking.
- What?

20:33.710 --> 20:35.450
We are hiking all day.

20:35.451 --> 20:36.712
Yeah.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.192
So it's going to be
be a lot heavier

20:38.193 --> 20:39.672
after an hour or seven.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.717
I'm fine.

20:41.544 --> 20:42.892
Uh-huh. Take that off.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.547
Let's do a little
necessity inspection.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.637
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God!

20:48.421 --> 20:49.465
That is heavy.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.425
What the hell
do you have in here?

20:53.426 --> 20:54.688
Okay.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.781
It's this thing.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.783
What am I feeling here?

21:03.784 --> 21:05.306
Oh my God. You
think you're even

21:05.307 --> 21:06.960
going to make a dent in that?

21:06.961 --> 21:09.005
I'm not gonna twiddle
my thumbs at night.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.442
I brought playing cards.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.140
Another extravagance
I don't approve of.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.796
Oh, in here is something
you could have lived without.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.107
And more denim.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.632
I'm not going to wear the same
pair of jeans for three days.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.808
You shouldn't be wearing
jeans at all!

21:28.809 --> 21:31.724
My God, Matt!

21:31.725 --> 21:33.813
This weight
is going to be killing you.

21:33.814 --> 21:37.686
- I can handle it.
- You have, like, four cups.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.601
Like, how many do you need?

21:39.602 --> 21:41.256
[calm chiming music]

22:42.361 --> 22:44.058
Hey, what's your
favorite color?

22:45.320 --> 22:48.454
- I don't know. Blue?
- But is it really blue?

22:49.803 --> 22:51.151
I don't know.
Does it matter?

22:51.152 --> 22:52.282
I always wonder.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.675
When people ask
me that question,

22:53.676 --> 22:55.460
if I'm giving a real answer,

22:55.461 --> 22:57.113
or if I'm just
saying the first thing

22:57.114 --> 22:58.377
that pops into my head?

22:59.726 --> 23:01.030
Who asks a grown man
what his favorite color is?

23:01.031 --> 23:02.380
You would be surprised.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.120
I always say
orange, but I think

23:04.121 --> 23:06.166
I only say that
because it's bright.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.689
Not all oranges are bright.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.952
I guess I'm talking about
bright orange.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.650
You're an odd man.

23:11.651 --> 23:14.087
I didn't think bright orange
existed in nature

23:14.088 --> 23:16.306
until I saw this mushroom cap.

23:16.307 --> 23:17.396
It was fucking neon.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.835
Oh, and newts.
There's an orange newt.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.752
You know newts
have been in space?

23:27.101 --> 23:29.102
A lot of animals
have been in space.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.973
So it doesn't move you at all

23:30.974 --> 23:33.411
to think about
this tiny amphibian

23:33.412 --> 23:35.848
being plucked
from the forest floor

23:35.849 --> 23:37.851
and flung into outer space?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.986
[breathes heavily]

23:45.641 --> 23:48.426
I think I could have been
a philosopher in another life.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.384
I would have been happy
with that life.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.951
It's not really
a job, is it?

23:51.952 --> 23:53.518
I'm talking about fantasy.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.563
You could be a
philosophy professor

23:55.564 --> 23:57.130
who wrote on the side.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.480
Yeah, a philosopher.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.787
- What about you?
- What do you mean?

24:01.788 --> 24:02.918
In another life.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.094
I'm happy with the
one I've made now.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.662
If you had to choose.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.577
Bookshop owner.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.710
What about you, Sam?

24:11.711 --> 24:14.060
I feel like I still get
to choose this life.

24:14.061 --> 24:17.019
You better not waste it,
cause you only get one.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.935
Nobody can say you
haven't made the most of it.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.633
What's that supposed to mean?

24:21.634 --> 24:23.505
Just that you've enjoyed life.

24:24.593 --> 24:27.682
- And?
- And it's a good thing.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.815
Well, you've
enjoyed life too.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.121
It's not an accusation, man.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.776
It feels a little accusy.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.406
[mutters]

25:56.206 --> 25:57.730
Oh, for crying out loud.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.397
[wailing]

26:26.628 --> 26:28.586
[whooping]

26:28.587 --> 26:30.153
[indistinct chatter]

26:32.678 --> 26:34.809
[shouting playfully]

26:34.810 --> 26:36.246
[indistinct chatter]

26:46.735 --> 26:48.302
How was your nature pee?

26:49.782 --> 26:50.739
It's great.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.920
The bars were supposed
to be packed on top.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.314
You packed the bars.

27:25.556 --> 27:26.948
I think I could do it.

27:26.949 --> 27:29.472
People train for,
like, a year, Matt.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.823
But if I had to, like,
gun to my head,

27:31.824 --> 27:33.781
I would get through it.

27:33.782 --> 27:37.132
There's a whole strategy.
It's not just, like, running.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.178
It's training certain
muscles to perform

27:39.179 --> 27:40.658
in a certain way, about pace.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.224
You can't just jump into it.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.749
Then how come there's always
some 80-year-old dude

27:44.750 --> 27:46.446
hustling with
the 25-year-olds?

27:46.447 --> 27:49.014
Because he's probably
been doing it his whole life.

27:49.015 --> 27:52.060
The impression I get
is that his wife died

27:52.061 --> 27:53.758
and he needs
a purpose in life.

27:53.759 --> 27:57.805
Okay. But I think for you,
since we're talking about you,

27:57.806 --> 28:00.242
I think it's going to take
more than just grief

28:00.243 --> 28:02.549
to get you in
the marathon flow.

28:02.550 --> 28:03.985
I'll train.

28:03.986 --> 28:06.379
I'm just saying, you want to
ease your way into that.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.424
I don't think
you want to, like...

28:08.425 --> 28:09.861
It's like steps.

28:09.862 --> 28:12.733
You're just jealous
because I can run a marathon.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.518
I'm not jealous
that you can run a marathon

28:15.519 --> 28:19.131
because you haven't run
a marathon.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.220
But you get back to me
when that happens.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.526
Count on it.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.156
Come on.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.053
Just keep it coming.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.582
Can you hand me
your sleeping bag?

29:19.888 --> 29:23.673
Yeah.
I realized a lot of miles ago

29:23.674 --> 29:25.328
that I left it in the car.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.243
Are you serious?

29:28.244 --> 29:29.985
What are you
going to sleep in?

29:32.596 --> 29:34.946
- What's up?
- Matt forgot his sleeping bag

29:34.947 --> 29:36.295
You're gonna be cold.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.949
I got a beanie.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.472
I did send you a list.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.822
I thought that was the stuff
you were bringing.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.085
Interesting you
managed to bring booze

29:44.086 --> 29:45.957
and didn't bring
a sleeping bag.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.047
I figured I'd need it
for the cold.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.965
[ethereal music]

30:44.320 --> 30:46.147
Fucking lighter.

30:46.148 --> 30:49.150
Sam, do you know
where the lighter is?

30:49.151 --> 30:51.501
Why don't you just rub
sticks together?

30:55.592 --> 30:57.158
Thank you.
[laughter]

30:57.159 --> 30:58.420
[man] Trail friends!

30:58.421 --> 30:59.466
Hey, company!

31:01.903 --> 31:03.469
Other people!

31:03.470 --> 31:05.472
- What's up?
- Hey.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.387
Hello.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.780
- Welcome.
- It's a nice little spot
you got here.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.391
- Good real estate.
- Thanks.

31:12.392 --> 31:13.609
And this is nice.

31:13.610 --> 31:16.569
Is this vintage?

31:16.570 --> 31:18.702
Yeah, well, I'm vintage, so...

31:19.225 --> 31:20.182
[laughter]

31:21.401 --> 31:22.923
He's going to be vintage cold

31:22.924 --> 31:24.926
because he forgot
his sleeping bag.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.841
You want to
borrow mine, big guy?

31:27.842 --> 31:29.321
Yeah. This guy runs hot.

31:29.322 --> 31:30.323
No. I'm good.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.237
You should take it.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.978
I'm gonna be
monastic about it.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.067
No frills.
Just me and the forest floor.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.808
Cool. Yeah. Me too.
So say if you need it.

31:38.809 --> 31:39.897
Great. Thanks.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.507
Hey, I want the
flat spot tonight.

31:41.508 --> 31:43.204
I was on a hill last night.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.641
Okay, let's get one thing
straight, though.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.078
That's the pee rock.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.559
And then 40 meters that way,
that's the poop rock.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.257
Are they staying here?

31:52.258 --> 31:54.302
That's fine. Is that my cup?

31:54.303 --> 31:56.391
- Are they staying here?
- It's fine.

31:56.392 --> 32:00.091
It sucks when you need
to pee and you see a poop
right next to it.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.962
I'm gonna go
scout a poop spot.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.486
I'll scout a pee spot.

32:22.592 --> 32:23.593
Not yet.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.249
Patience.

32:29.643 --> 32:30.948
Careful.

32:30.949 --> 32:31.950
I'm careful.

32:34.213 --> 32:36.214
I know how to cut
a scallion, Dad.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.563
Totally.

32:37.564 --> 32:41.697
My girlfriend at the time
was a witch.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.830
- And...
- Hook me up.

32:43.831 --> 32:48.095
You know, she kind of got me
into doing a daily reading
and...

32:48.096 --> 32:52.622
But then I actually found
a lot of value.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.495
You know,
kind of just a nice framework

32:56.496 --> 32:59.629
to kind of approach the day.

33:00.848 --> 33:01.849
Oh yeah.

33:03.198 --> 33:04.329
Perfect.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.809
- I haven't had a reading.
- Oh.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.115
I'm interested.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.596
I'd love to do one for you
if you don't mind.

33:10.597 --> 33:13.512
- Tonight?
- I don't have my deck on me.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.775
- I have a deck.
- You have a deck on you?

33:15.776 --> 33:17.298
When do you
put the scallions?

33:17.299 --> 33:18.734
What kind of
deck do you use?

33:18.735 --> 33:20.301
You garnish
with the scallions.

33:20.302 --> 33:22.173
- Oh, I see, it's a garnish.

33:22.174 --> 33:23.609
Put it on top.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.089
It doesn't go
in with the rest.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.048
- She knows what she's doing.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.877
[indistinct chatter]

33:34.621 --> 33:37.405
That's a very steady pour.
Did you notice that, Matt?

33:37.406 --> 33:38.712
It's a very steady pour.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.586
Do you guys
want chili flakes?

33:44.587 --> 33:45.674
Yes, please.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.676
- I want everything.
- All of it?

33:47.677 --> 33:49.852
Well, not the whole bottle
of chili flakes.

33:49.853 --> 33:50.940
Of course not.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.855
I'd like the whole complement,

33:52.856 --> 33:54.161
the little magical things

33:54.162 --> 33:56.816
in that plastic bag
that you brought.

33:56.817 --> 33:58.731
- Cheers, boys.
- Cheers.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.124
- Cheers.
- Cheers, guys.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.517
Love you guys.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.258
Mmm.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.260
Mmm!

34:08.089 --> 34:09.786
- It's yours.
- Thank you, Sam.

34:12.963 --> 34:14.442
Thank you.

34:14.443 --> 34:15.923
God, this smells good.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.372
You guys are
like little monsters.

34:42.819 --> 34:43.951
You okay?

34:45.648 --> 34:46.649
It's just...

34:48.651 --> 34:49.957
It's just so good.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.793
I wish Dylan was here
so he could try it.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.285
What was our first hike?

35:14.286 --> 35:16.635
Was it the year
we graduated?

35:16.636 --> 35:19.072
It was a year
after we were out of college.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.728
You just started dating April.
God, she was hot.

35:22.903 --> 35:25.644
You're talking about
Sam's mother, Matt.

35:25.645 --> 35:26.775
I know Mom's hot.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.560
- You guys had
just started dating.

35:28.561 --> 35:31.432
I was super pissed
that you brought her along.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.174
- She was the only one
that knew where we were going.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.481
She did everything.
We were hopeless.

35:36.482 --> 35:40.006
You were hopeless.
It was such a crazy idea.

35:40.007 --> 35:42.791
So we're going up
this steep mountain road...

35:42.792 --> 35:43.879
With the cliff.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.707
Like, two inches
from the edge.

35:45.708 --> 35:49.015
- You could see skid marks
going off the cliff.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.408
And it was pitch black.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.801
- Couldn't see a thing,
not even a moon out.

35:52.802 --> 35:56.196
April had to tape a flashlight
to the cliff side of the car.

35:56.197 --> 36:00.505
- And it's a 200-dollar
beater of a car that we had.

36:00.506 --> 36:01.941
A disaster. That wasn't even

36:01.942 --> 36:03.638
the weird part
of the whole trip.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.162
[laughs]

36:05.163 --> 36:06.989
- What was her name?
- Angela.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.687
- Angela.
- Who's Angela?

36:08.688 --> 36:10.819
She wore flip-flops
the whole...

36:10.820 --> 36:12.647
I was dating her. She wore...

36:12.648 --> 36:15.041
Yeah. Matt couldn't handle
being alone,

36:15.042 --> 36:17.174
so he manifests this female
to bring along.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.653
- Well, we properly did it.

36:18.654 --> 36:21.787
She'd met my mom,
but she wore...

36:21.788 --> 36:24.050
[laughs] She
hiked in flip-flops.

36:24.051 --> 36:25.182
- The whole time!

36:25.183 --> 36:28.489
- I even know that
you don't do that.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.143
But then she just left.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.971
- Do you remember that?
- I remember.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.320
And we only had one car.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.539
I don't know how she...

36:34.540 --> 36:36.323
She walked home
in her flip-flops?

36:36.324 --> 36:39.805
Was something wrong with her?
She was schizophrenic or...?

36:39.806 --> 36:41.633
Yeah, but I don't...

36:41.634 --> 36:43.591
I don't think
that's why she left.

36:43.592 --> 36:44.853
I mean, maybe...

36:44.854 --> 36:47.421
- It's because you farted her
out of the tent.

36:47.422 --> 36:48.596
[laughter]

36:48.597 --> 36:50.208
You two are fools.

36:54.777 --> 36:58.432
- In the tarot,
the fool's actually awesome.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.392
It's like a...

37:01.349 --> 37:03.003
innocent adventurer.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.701
I hope I'm a fool.
When I'm old.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.877
You can't play that.
Aces are not high.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.009
- Since when?

37:10.010 --> 37:11.793
- The beginning
of the 19th century.

37:11.794 --> 37:13.448
When the game was invented.

37:17.496 --> 37:18.540
Walking is cool.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.107
I love walking.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.414
Yeah. Our buddy Josh
was supposed to come too,

37:23.415 --> 37:24.589
but his cousin died,

37:24.590 --> 37:26.460
and now he's
walking to Canada.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.245
- Yeah.
- To honor his cousin.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.116
Did his cousin walk?

37:30.117 --> 37:32.553
- No. His cousin died.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.642
- When I was in my 20s,
my ex and I,

37:34.643 --> 37:37.123
we hiked through Patagonia.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.256
- Oh, we did that!
- Took a lifetime.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.300
We did that last year.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.302
We did six weeks
in South America.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.870
We've got to get back there.

37:44.871 --> 37:47.264
You guys ever go to Alaska?

37:47.265 --> 37:50.136
Yeah, we did rovers,
like, three years ago.

37:50.137 --> 37:51.659
It's too cold for me.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.401
It's cold.
I don't like that too much.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.403
- Wow.

37:56.796 --> 38:01.756
Well, I'm thinking
of doing a trek across China.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.890
Putting a crew together
three to four weeks next year.

38:04.891 --> 38:07.588
Are you? How's Casey
gonna feel about that?

38:07.589 --> 38:09.677
What do you mean?
She'd come with.

38:09.678 --> 38:10.853
With the kid?

38:12.246 --> 38:14.508
This guy looks old,
but he actually has a baby.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.205
- Whoa!

38:16.206 --> 38:18.164
- Seriously, how's
Casey gonna feel like

38:18.165 --> 38:19.731
if you take off for a month.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.950
- I don't consider it
taking off.

38:21.951 --> 38:25.911
You know, the best thing
you can do is have a family.

38:25.912 --> 38:29.523
That's the last step
in your maturity.

38:29.524 --> 38:32.614
And sometimes they're gonna
hate you. And sometimes...

38:34.703 --> 38:35.834
they gonna even want

38:35.835 --> 38:37.532
to hang out with
you, like this one.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.494
Would you consider
trekking across China with me?

38:44.234 --> 38:46.714
Yeah, that sounds cool.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.455
I'd trek across
China with you, man.

38:48.456 --> 38:49.630
I'm in.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.153
Now we've got our team.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.285
Matt, you come too,

38:52.286 --> 38:54.114
but you got to
work on your core.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.033
I gotta piss.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.649
[crickets chirping,
bird calls, animals rustling]

39:26.189 --> 39:28.104
- Are you sleeping?
- I am.

39:30.237 --> 39:31.716
OK.

39:31.717 --> 39:34.110
[calm music]

41:00.545 --> 41:02.023
- It's ready now.
- It's not.

41:02.024 --> 41:03.808
It's gotta get to a full boil.

41:03.809 --> 41:06.507
Otherwise, the bean doesn't...

41:08.553 --> 41:09.858
...meet its potential.

41:11.338 --> 41:12.599
You need the bean to meet it's
potential.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.601
[grunts]

41:14.602 --> 41:15.560
Okay.

41:16.735 --> 41:17.953
[clears throat]

41:22.044 --> 41:23.089
Hey.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.047
How'd you sleep?

41:25.787 --> 41:26.875
Soundly.

41:30.531 --> 41:32.272
Were you one with the forest?

41:36.406 --> 41:37.930
[electric buzzing]

41:53.380 --> 41:54.512
A slug.

41:59.168 --> 42:00.169
Oh yeah.

42:20.799 --> 42:23.061
You probably shouldn't
eat food in the tent.

42:23.062 --> 42:24.584
I need my night snacks.

42:24.585 --> 42:27.500
You had food in
the tent last night?

42:27.501 --> 42:29.850
- Just a little bit.
- What were you thinking?!

42:29.851 --> 42:32.070
A bear can smell
a fucking blueberry, Matt!

42:32.071 --> 42:34.855
- I have low blood sugar.
- I don't care what you have!

42:34.856 --> 42:37.379
Be reckless with your kid!
That's my daughter!

42:37.380 --> 42:38.990
- Dad, it's okay.
- Okay. Chill.

42:38.991 --> 42:40.645
- No, it's not!
- Chill, chill.

42:43.082 --> 42:44.823
He's right.
I'm sorry, Christopher.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.375
[sighs]

43:50.366 --> 43:51.453
French fries,

43:51.454 --> 43:54.152
soggy from the
oil, but still crispy,

43:54.153 --> 43:55.415
dipped in mayonnaise.

43:57.112 --> 44:00.375
Strawberry milkshake.
Very cold.

44:00.376 --> 44:05.076
Okay. Wedge salad with
a ribeye and creamed spinach.

44:05.077 --> 44:06.294
And two martinis.

44:06.295 --> 44:07.470
Um...

44:08.471 --> 44:10.472
Fried chicken sandwich I had

44:10.473 --> 44:13.346
I had that had this, like,
jalapeno coleslaw.

44:14.347 --> 44:16.043
Soup dumplings, piping hot,

44:16.044 --> 44:19.656
but cool enough
you don't burn your mouth.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.483
Grilled cheese with
American cheese,

44:21.484 --> 44:23.790
tomato and a Coke.

44:23.791 --> 44:26.315
- Very cold, from the can.
- You know what?

44:27.447 --> 44:30.579
Just a simple fried egg

44:30.580 --> 44:35.280
with bacon and sausage
and hash browns,

44:35.281 --> 44:37.586
and two blueberry pancakes
with maple syrup.

44:37.587 --> 44:38.676
And also a waffle.

44:40.025 --> 44:41.766
Sounds reasonable.

44:43.768 --> 44:45.770
- Here.
- Nah...

44:46.858 --> 44:48.206
We're gonna get more.

44:48.207 --> 44:50.557
No. I'm good.
Okay, give me that water.

44:58.957 --> 45:00.262
Okay, let's do this.

45:43.828 --> 45:45.177
[water rushing]

46:44.671 --> 46:46.064
This make our top five?

46:49.023 --> 46:50.808
Yeah, I think it does.

46:52.461 --> 46:54.072
[phones buzzing]

46:56.857 --> 46:57.815
Oh.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.425
This must be the elevation.

47:00.426 --> 47:01.819
[notification sounds]

47:11.263 --> 47:12.307
[sighs]

47:14.222 --> 47:16.007
Everything okay with work?

47:16.659 --> 47:17.878
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:20.272 --> 47:22.927
Yeah. I didn't come up here
to think about that.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.076
Oh, Jesus.

47:43.164 --> 47:44.383
Okay.

47:45.384 --> 47:46.385
No more.

47:56.134 --> 47:57.482
Dad.

47:57.483 --> 47:58.570
Stop.

47:58.571 --> 47:59.832
What?

47:59.833 --> 48:01.617
- No.
- Come on.

48:03.706 --> 48:06.100
Hey, Matt,
will you take a picture of us?

48:18.286 --> 48:19.939
Let's see.

48:19.940 --> 48:21.159
Okay.

48:22.508 --> 48:24.509
- Thank you.
- You can see my bald spot.

48:24.510 --> 48:26.642
- Isn't that nice?
- I like that one.

48:28.296 --> 48:31.777
We got to do this more often.
I got to do this more often.

48:31.778 --> 48:33.170
I got to, like, hike

48:33.171 --> 48:35.999
the whole West
Coast or something.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.915
[scoffs] Yeah. You should.

48:39.873 --> 48:40.874
Why?

48:42.006 --> 48:43.920
[chuckles] No. Absolutely.

48:43.921 --> 48:44.922
Dad...

48:47.141 --> 48:48.099
What?

48:53.582 --> 48:54.932
You should do that.

48:55.889 --> 48:56.934
That'd be fun.

49:04.115 --> 49:05.855
[fire crackling,
crickets chirping]

49:17.693 --> 49:19.608
[indistinct chatter]

49:26.876 --> 49:27.877
It's so quiet.

49:35.059 --> 49:36.321
[insect buzzing]

50:25.761 --> 50:26.762
Oh.

50:28.112 --> 50:31.940
Alright. You ready
to be freaked the fuck out?

50:31.941 --> 50:33.638
This is gonna be
so fucking scary

50:33.639 --> 50:35.118
you're gonna shit your pants.

50:35.119 --> 50:37.468
Oh, okay.

50:37.469 --> 50:39.122
Okay.

50:39.123 --> 50:41.646
So this happened to Allison,

50:41.647 --> 50:43.388
who works for me.

50:44.998 --> 50:46.085
And she was, uh...

50:46.086 --> 50:50.568
She is a very nice girl.

50:50.569 --> 50:53.484
But she's had
such a terrible time

50:53.485 --> 50:55.312
meeting guys, right?

50:55.313 --> 50:56.400
Very bad luck.

50:56.401 --> 50:58.706
But finally she
meets this guy online,

50:58.707 --> 51:03.189
and she's smitten with him,
and he is smitten with her.

51:03.190 --> 51:05.366
And, in fact,
they're a couple of smittens.

51:08.108 --> 51:12.025
And he has a cabin
in the woods.

51:12.808 --> 51:14.679
In... in...

51:14.680 --> 51:15.854
deep woods.

51:15.855 --> 51:17.247
Oh my God.

51:17.248 --> 51:18.335
What?

51:18.336 --> 51:19.815
[chuckles]

51:20.468 --> 51:22.165
This is...

51:22.166 --> 51:24.167
Focus! This is...

51:24.168 --> 51:26.387
Anyway, so they go up there.

51:29.912 --> 51:32.523
There's no internet
and no cell service.

51:32.524 --> 51:35.352
Oh, and there was
a sound outside.

51:35.353 --> 51:37.789
And so she's like,
I should go outside

51:37.790 --> 51:39.704
and see what's out there.

51:39.705 --> 51:41.140
Is it an animal?

51:41.141 --> 51:45.188
And so she opens the door

51:45.189 --> 51:49.061
and she steps outside.

51:49.062 --> 51:50.889
Dad, you're terrible at this.

51:50.890 --> 51:53.239
[laughter]

51:53.240 --> 51:55.111
This is real!

51:55.112 --> 51:56.764
You're supposed
to be confident

51:56.765 --> 51:58.505
in all your details
and everything.

51:58.506 --> 52:01.160
- That's what makes it scary.
- It wasn't an animal.

52:01.161 --> 52:04.468
It was the ex-girlfriend.
She had a knife or something.

52:04.469 --> 52:07.340
Maybe it was the neighbor.
Anyway, the end.

52:07.341 --> 52:10.300
I was just getting going.
You have no patience.

52:10.301 --> 52:12.345
Dad... [laughs]

52:12.346 --> 52:14.521
That was the worst.
Okay, I've got one.

52:14.522 --> 52:16.480
And this is
a real-life true story

52:16.481 --> 52:18.221
that you better
brace yourself for

52:18.222 --> 52:20.223
because it's fucking spooky.

52:20.224 --> 52:22.442
So there's this guy.

52:22.443 --> 52:24.140
We'll call him...

52:24.141 --> 52:25.445
Smatt.

52:25.446 --> 52:27.186
No, Pat, we'll call him Pat.

52:27.187 --> 52:30.058
So Pat is a successful man
of stage and screen.

52:30.059 --> 52:32.235
For example, he
has a recurring role

52:32.236 --> 52:34.106
in an early 2000' crime drama

52:34.107 --> 52:37.196
and with that money,
he buys an apartment.

52:37.197 --> 52:39.459
And he's living
high on the hog.

52:39.460 --> 52:41.766
People love him
and he's got a wife,

52:41.767 --> 52:44.116
and soon he'll have a son.

52:44.117 --> 52:46.771
And everybody is living
high on the hog

52:46.772 --> 52:51.645
until work starts to dry up
and he can't book.

52:51.646 --> 52:54.648
And the residuals
only take him so far.

52:54.649 --> 52:56.955
And his wife is a poet,

52:56.956 --> 52:58.522
which to her credit,

52:58.523 --> 53:02.221
she did start teaching
adult ESL classes at night.

53:02.222 --> 53:05.485
But it's not gonna put the boy
through college.

53:05.486 --> 53:07.923
So Patty boy starts to panic.

53:09.882 --> 53:11.578
And another
actor friend of his

53:11.579 --> 53:13.232
sells blenders on commission.

53:13.233 --> 53:17.628
So on his darkest day,
Pat signs on.

53:17.629 --> 53:19.804
And you know what?
He's amazing.

53:19.805 --> 53:23.547
He's great at selling
toasters and blenders.

53:23.548 --> 53:26.202
He's so good, in
fact, that they pay him

53:26.203 --> 53:28.116
to train the other employees

53:28.117 --> 53:29.379
and they fly him to Vegas,

53:29.380 --> 53:31.250
they put him up
at Caesars Palace.

53:31.251 --> 53:35.080
He's training
hundreds of failed actors

53:35.081 --> 53:37.865
to sell these products.

53:37.866 --> 53:41.218
And one night
at the craps table,

53:42.436 --> 53:46.396
a female trainee
puts her hand on his knee

53:46.397 --> 53:49.355
and she asks him up
to her room,

53:49.356 --> 53:50.705
and, well...

53:52.316 --> 53:55.971
he does a stupid,
stupid thing.

53:58.670 --> 54:00.540
It's pretty spooky, right?

54:00.541 --> 54:02.674
You do the bad thing, and...

54:03.979 --> 54:05.371
I don't know,
you keep thinking

54:05.372 --> 54:06.546
about the bad thing,

54:06.547 --> 54:09.723
and the bad thing
is all you think about.

54:09.724 --> 54:11.552
Multiple times a day.

54:12.771 --> 54:14.162
And one day you realize,

54:14.163 --> 54:17.036
oh, I only thought about
the bad thing once today.

54:19.168 --> 54:21.388
That's not even the thing
that made her leave.

54:22.650 --> 54:24.738
She never even really knew
about it.

54:24.739 --> 54:27.350
Then you think about
the bad thing a little bit,

54:27.351 --> 54:30.875
but then you kind of
can't even remember

54:30.876 --> 54:32.921
what the bad thing was.

54:34.445 --> 54:36.707
And after a while
you don't think about it.

54:36.708 --> 54:38.666
It's like it never
even happened.

54:39.754 --> 54:41.712
[laughs]

54:41.713 --> 54:43.149
Fuck.

54:45.586 --> 54:48.894
I'm sorry.
I'm really weepy lately.

54:50.939 --> 54:52.810
I was so in love with her.

54:52.811 --> 54:55.247
Remember when she got pregnant
and I got so sick

54:55.248 --> 54:56.857
and I put on, like, 15 pounds,

54:56.858 --> 54:59.512
and we joked that it was
like a sympathetic reaction.

54:59.513 --> 55:01.558
But she never knew this...

55:01.559 --> 55:03.124
[voice cracking]

55:03.125 --> 55:06.302
That I actually
felt her labor.

55:06.303 --> 55:09.306
I felt myself being torn
wide open.

55:10.611 --> 55:13.091
That's a thing.
In Papua New Guinea,

55:13.092 --> 55:15.136
the husband will build a hut,

55:15.137 --> 55:17.878
and when the wife
is giving labor,

55:17.879 --> 55:21.317
he'll like, enact labor,

55:21.318 --> 55:23.623
he'll basically do
a labor ritual.

55:23.624 --> 55:26.757
I don't know why we
don't do that in our culture.

55:26.758 --> 55:29.326
I certainly felt that.

55:34.287 --> 55:36.723
And now
all I'm thinking about is,

55:36.724 --> 55:38.900
this is my future.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.991
I don't know
how he became so...

55:44.341 --> 55:46.343
Yeah. Untethered.

55:49.041 --> 55:50.172
Oh, man.

55:53.001 --> 55:55.047
It happens to the best of us.

56:02.097 --> 56:04.796
The worst just
doesn't happen to you.

56:05.753 --> 56:07.625
You're involved
in the process.

56:09.409 --> 56:11.455
Well, I didn't want
to get divorced.

56:12.543 --> 56:14.501
It wasn't my idea,
for the record.

56:20.072 --> 56:21.986
Maybe mom
wouldn't want if you

56:21.987 --> 56:24.597
didn't do things that
made her want to.

56:24.598 --> 56:27.732
I didn't do things
until after she did things.

56:29.690 --> 56:31.822
So it's both your faults.

56:31.823 --> 56:33.085
That's my point.

56:35.957 --> 56:38.482
I just couldn't make
your mother happy.

56:43.356 --> 56:44.357
Okay.

56:51.146 --> 56:52.800
She's right. You're right.

56:54.106 --> 56:55.499
We're all complicit.

56:58.371 --> 57:00.112
How did you get so wise?

57:01.243 --> 57:02.419
I'm not really.

57:04.464 --> 57:07.293
So tell me this.
What's next for me?

57:13.908 --> 57:15.127
Hmm...

57:16.998 --> 57:18.695
This might be really spooky.

57:18.696 --> 57:20.262
[laughs]

57:21.307 --> 57:22.308
Um...

57:24.658 --> 57:26.094
I'd say...

57:27.922 --> 57:29.881
in two to three months

57:31.143 --> 57:33.885
you're gonna meet
a beautiful 25-year-old.

57:37.236 --> 57:39.542
And then you're
gonna stay in it

57:39.543 --> 57:40.891
because it's fun.

57:40.892 --> 57:42.676
She's gonna stay in it.

57:44.286 --> 57:46.897
Then it's gonna get
kind of serious

57:46.898 --> 57:48.507
when she turns 30.

57:48.508 --> 57:49.727
[laughs]

57:51.163 --> 57:53.904
Cause she's gonna want
to start doing adult things,

57:53.905 --> 57:59.039
you know, like, have the kids,
do the marriage, you know.

57:59.040 --> 58:02.390
And, I mean, you're 60,
so you have no control.

58:02.391 --> 58:04.828
You're gonna do
whatever she says.

58:04.829 --> 58:09.572
So then you are gonna be 60
with a newborn.

58:09.573 --> 58:10.747
Alright. Okay.

58:10.748 --> 58:12.619
Yeah. Alright, we get it.

58:14.403 --> 58:16.056
I'm just kidding.

58:16.057 --> 58:18.016
It's depressingly accurate.

58:21.236 --> 58:24.152
When will my son
stop hating me?

58:25.676 --> 58:26.633
Never.

58:27.895 --> 58:31.072
But look what you made.
Made a good one.

58:32.987 --> 58:34.815
I tried not to fuck her up.

58:41.822 --> 58:44.998
I don't think it's a matter of
whether he hates you or not.

58:44.999 --> 58:49.526
I think right now he feels
the need to protect Stephanie.

58:50.309 --> 58:51.352
Yeah.

58:51.353 --> 58:52.702
So right now,

58:52.703 --> 58:55.879
just don't make him
pick sides.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.272
I just think about
all the bad things about me

58:58.273 --> 59:00.013
that she's filling
his head with.

59:00.014 --> 59:01.885
I mean, you're
always gonna wonder

59:01.886 --> 59:04.191
what she's saying about you.

59:04.192 --> 59:06.542
But the best thing you can do
in this situation

59:06.543 --> 59:09.719
is just say only
nice things about her.

59:09.720 --> 59:11.635
Try it. See what happens.

59:14.028 --> 59:15.552
Too young to be so wise.

59:17.728 --> 59:20.164
Well, I've had
some experience.

59:20.165 --> 59:23.255
[sleepily] You just give Dylan
too much stuff.

59:25.605 --> 59:28.173
He's gotta
take care of himself.

59:32.438 --> 59:33.613
Or do that.

59:34.614 --> 59:36.528
Go to bed, man.

59:36.529 --> 59:38.791
Dad. You're sleeping.

59:38.792 --> 59:40.011
I'm not sleeping.

59:41.882 --> 59:43.796
But I think
I'm gonna go to bed.

59:43.797 --> 59:45.406
Okay. Do you want water?

59:45.407 --> 59:47.365
No, I don't.

59:47.366 --> 59:48.975
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

59:48.976 --> 59:50.673
Good. Okay.

59:50.674 --> 59:52.588
- Watch the fire.
- Be right there.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.285
Yeah. I'm okay.

59:54.286 --> 59:56.157
- Sweet dreams, buddy.
- Yep.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.165
[sighs]

01:00:10.824 --> 01:00:12.217
[tent zipper closing]

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.053
You're pretty smart, huh?

01:00:25.883 --> 01:00:27.188
And observant.

01:00:29.887 --> 01:00:32.150
- I don't know.
- Oh, yeah. You are.

01:00:36.023 --> 01:00:37.590
Okay. Observe me.

01:00:43.509 --> 01:00:45.336
You're a little drunk.

01:00:45.337 --> 01:00:46.991
[laughs] No, shit.

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:49.515
And sad.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:51.778
Ding, ding.

01:00:55.086 --> 01:00:57.697
You know, I haven't lived
alone in 30 years.

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:01.135
You have Dylan, though.

01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:04.661
He thinks my place
is depressing.

01:01:05.313 --> 01:01:06.619
It is depressing.

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:14.235
Maybe you should
get some plants.

01:01:16.237 --> 01:01:17.543
Plants.

01:01:20.938 --> 01:01:23.201
Well, it'll get better.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:26.899
That's what people say.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.380
Sorry.
It's kind of a dumb thing.

01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:31.383
I know. I believe you.

01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:41.697
Oh. It's cold.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:42.916
Yeah.

01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:50.402
You know what
kind of moon that is?

01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:55.276
- No.
- It's a new moon.

01:01:56.408 --> 01:01:58.366
See how you can...

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:03.719
sort of see the rest of it?

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.201
Like you can see
the outline of the old moon.

01:02:09.421 --> 01:02:10.770
It's called earthshine.

01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:14.034
Earthshine.

01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:16.820
I love that word.

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.771
I'm going to put this out.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.773
Yeah.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.818
Or you can sleep
next to the fire.

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:02.081
It's probably warmer
than your tent.

01:03:02.082 --> 01:03:03.910
Unless you can keep me warm.

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:16.357
Yeah. It's not fair.
Your dad gets extra body heat.

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:29.066
I'm gonna get some water.

01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:03.840
[birds chirping]

01:04:18.593 --> 01:04:20.552
[tense music]

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.743
[music fades]

01:10:40.584 --> 01:10:41.889
Excited about college?

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:46.676
What?

01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:49.201
Are you excited
about college?

01:10:51.508 --> 01:10:52.639
What?

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.513
I think that's
the first question

01:10:57.514 --> 01:10:59.036
you've asked me all weekend.

01:10:59.037 --> 01:11:01.605
Come on, I ask you
questions all the time.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.437
Not exactly.

01:11:10.831 --> 01:11:12.268
Well, are you?

01:11:14.966 --> 01:11:15.967
Sure.

01:11:18.012 --> 01:11:19.013
"Sure"?

01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:21.451
That's it?

01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:26.890
I just don't feel like
talking about it.

01:11:26.891 --> 01:11:29.372
Like trying to squeeze water
out of a rock.

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:33.289
I'm just tired.

01:11:58.226 --> 01:11:59.488
[laughs]

01:11:59.489 --> 01:12:00.490
Stop.

01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:04.754
- Dad...
- Come on!

01:12:04.755 --> 01:12:06.322
Do you want to take a dip?

01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:13.720
Attagirl.

01:12:22.947 --> 01:12:25.689
So Matt said something
kind of weird last night.

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.474
Yeah? Well, he's a weirdo.

01:12:38.266 --> 01:12:40.051
But he was
kind of weird to me.

01:12:41.182 --> 01:12:43.140
You know not to listen to him.

01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:44.576
No, I know.

01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:46.404
It was...

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:48.711
Don't get offended by him.
He has no filter.

01:12:48.712 --> 01:12:50.278
I'm not offended by him.

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:53.020
I'm just saying.

01:12:57.503 --> 01:12:59.199
He asked me to come into
his tent last night

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.724
to keep him warm.

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:04.641
Well, he should have brought
a sleeping bag.

01:13:07.992 --> 01:13:09.296
Don't you think that's weird?

01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:10.385
I hope you told him

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:11.951
he should freeze
his ass off by himself.

01:13:11.952 --> 01:13:14.085
That's what he gets
for not being prepared.

01:13:17.218 --> 01:13:18.394
It's not about that.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.407
Come on.

01:13:36.368 --> 01:13:38.022
Can we just have a nice day?

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.420
Yeah.

01:13:57.824 --> 01:13:59.435
[calm harp music]

01:16:46.906 --> 01:16:48.212
[music fades]

01:19:34.073 --> 01:19:35.901
[breathes heavily]

01:21:20.788 --> 01:21:22.355
[breathes heavily]

01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:34.426
Jesse: Hey! I know you won't
get this until tomorrow,

01:22:34.427 --> 01:22:35.950
but I had to tell you

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:40.998
that Solaris made
fucking tofu lasagna,

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:43.740
and it was
absolutely disgusting.

01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:45.742
And she was asking
everyone to go around

01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:47.266
and tell her how good it was.

01:22:48.267 --> 01:22:49.528
It was a mess.

01:22:49.529 --> 01:22:50.790
[laughs]

01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:52.575
Anyways...

01:22:52.576 --> 01:22:54.403
Obviously, I miss you.

01:22:54.404 --> 01:22:56.144
Uh... Yeah.

01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:57.189
Bye.

01:23:43.627 --> 01:23:45.455
[birds chirping]

01:24:02.341 --> 01:24:03.951
[footsteps]

01:24:25.799 --> 01:24:27.062
Where were you?

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:29.064
[quietly] Here.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.456
You just up and left?

01:24:31.457 --> 01:24:33.155
Yeah, I guess I did.

01:24:37.768 --> 01:24:39.986
Well, I guess
I just don't get it.

01:24:39.987 --> 01:24:41.728
I didn't think you would.

01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:28.340
Sam.

01:25:32.301 --> 01:25:33.258
What?

01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:38.698
You wanna drive?

01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:41.571
No.

01:25:56.847 --> 01:25:57.848
Okay.

01:26:02.809 --> 01:26:04.724
[whispers] Will you
please drive?

01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:08.989
Okay, Dad.

01:26:23.265 --> 01:26:24.396
It's locked.

01:26:25.789 --> 01:26:26.877
It's locked!

01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:34.145
Please, open the door!

01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:39.802
Oh my God. Come on!

01:26:39.803 --> 01:26:41.631
Hey! Come on! Open the door!

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.198
Sam.

01:26:47.463 --> 01:26:49.638
Please. I'm tired.
Can you open the...

01:26:49.639 --> 01:26:50.813
[lock opening]

01:26:50.814 --> 01:26:51.858
Thank you.

01:27:24.804 --> 01:27:30.156
[woman sings]
In-between two tall mountains

01:27:30.157 --> 01:27:33.029
there's a place

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:37.251
they call Lonesome.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.731
Don't see why

01:27:39.732 --> 01:27:43.779
they call it Lonesome;

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.608
I'm never lonesome

01:27:46.609 --> 01:27:50.176
when I go there.

01:27:50.177 --> 01:27:51.918
[calm guitar tune]

01:27:54.312 --> 01:27:57.923
See that bird sittin'
on my windowsill?

01:27:57.924 --> 01:28:00.230
Well he's sayin'
whip-poor-will

01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:02.711
all the night through.

01:28:02.712 --> 01:28:06.192
See that brook
runnin' by my kitchen door?

01:28:06.193 --> 01:28:11.154
Well, it couldn't talk no more
if it was you.

01:28:11.155 --> 01:28:15.376
Up that tree there's
sort of a squirrel thing.

01:28:15.377 --> 01:28:19.684
Sounds just like we did
when we were quarrelling.

01:28:19.685 --> 01:28:23.862
In the yard
I keep a pig or two.

01:28:23.863 --> 01:28:28.171
They drop in for dinner
like you used to do.

01:28:28.172 --> 01:28:31.609
I don't stand
in the need of company,

01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:36.875
with everything
I see talkin' like you.

01:28:36.876 --> 01:28:40.792
Up that tree there's
sort of a squirrel thing.

01:28:40.793 --> 01:28:45.275
Sounds just like we did
when we were quarrelling.

01:28:45.276 --> 01:28:49.453
You may think
you left me all alone,

01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:53.892
but I can hear you talk
without a telephone.

01:28:53.893 --> 01:28:57.374
I don't stand
in the need of company,

01:28:57.375 --> 01:29:02.379
with everything I see
talkin' like you.

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:06.165
See that bird
sittin' on my windowsill?

01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:08.516
Well, he's sayin'
whip-poor-will

01:29:08.517 --> 01:29:10.953
all the night through.

01:29:10.954 --> 01:29:16.219
Just whip-poor-will
all the night through.

01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.529
In-between two tall mountains

01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:24.227
there's a place

01:29:24.228 --> 01:29:28.100
they call Lonesome.

01:29:28.101 --> 01:29:30.494
Don't see why

01:29:30.495 --> 01:29:34.803
they call it Lonesome;

01:29:34.804 --> 01:29:37.849
I'm never lonesome

01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:41.245
now I live there.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.030
[man] When did you write that?

01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:47.816
How did you happen
to get that idea?

01:29:47.817 --> 01:29:48.861
[voice fades]
