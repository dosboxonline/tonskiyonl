WEBVTT

01:11.029 --> 01:13.365
You disappeared on me.
We had an appointment.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.701
The mountains called.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.663
Sadie, it's normal
to be affected by what happened.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.833
Death, anyone's, can fill us with urgency.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.710
This is not about what happened.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.920
I didn't really know her, but…

01:28.547 --> 01:29.965
She was the same as me.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.884
Same age, same job.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.554
The one time I was in her house,
it was the same as mine.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.973
Nice, but cold.

01:38.056 --> 01:43.812
Empty, except for one sad houseplant,
which is more than I have.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.772
She died alone.

01:46.398 --> 01:51.153
Sadie, stay present.
No big moves, no big changes.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.574
So don't marry
the rafting guide I just met?

01:56.491 --> 01:57.868
Maybe start with a houseplant.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.578
I'd probably eat it.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.497
My cold, empty house has a cold,
empty fridge.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.583
I'm gonna stop for groceries.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.710
-Let's check in tomorrow.
-Yeah.

02:10.506 --> 02:14.551
No pesticides, more nutrients.
It just tastes better, you know.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.888
Out of 20.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.644
Sorry, guys.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.116
Five, six, seven. Have a good one.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.538
You know you're gonna need
to buy stock in those trackers.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.706
You'd lose your butt
if it wasn't attached to you.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.334
Well, you lost your hair,
and that was attached.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.670
I walked into that one.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.047
Hey, Cole. Are you okay?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.509
Yeah, heard you got dumped.
Tough break, man.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.305
-Edna.
-I gossip when I'm bored.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.349
For your information, it was mutual.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.226
That's what everyone says
after getting dumped.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.394
That's true.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.521
Maybe try being a little less needy,
you know?

03:07.604 --> 03:09.022
Girls don't really like that.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.232
I'm not needy.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.986
We just grew apart.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.029
And I really just don't wanna talk
about it.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.450
You wanna go get high?

03:22.119 --> 03:23.871
I got a edible in the truck.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.957
No, thanks.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.334
Okay. Well, watch my booth.
I'm gonna go get high.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.087
Enjoy.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.799
-Come on. Here.
-Uh, just that one.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.344
-Just this one.
-I'll take one too.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.351
Salmon. Halibut. It's all fresh.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.489
Can I help you?

04:02.618 --> 04:05.454
Yes, thank you. I'm gonna get that one.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.124
Begonia. Nice choice.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.335
-Is that what it is?
-Yeah.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.505
It is pretty.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.589
Yeah.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.222
Don't let any pets eat the leaves.
They can be slightly toxic.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.558
Pretty and slightly toxic.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.645
What is it with me and roommates?

04:29.728 --> 04:31.813
Didn't realize you roomed
with all of my exes.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.572
How much watering does it need?

04:41.240 --> 04:44.535
Every other day or so.
Begonias need a little bit of love.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.374
I'm actually gone a lot for work.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.459
Okay.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.045
Okay, got it. Less love.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.422
What about a snake plant?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.008
They only need watering every two weeks.

05:01.718 --> 05:06.014
Sometimes I'm gone longer,
like a month or two.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.058
Okay.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.104
Sorry, then why do you want a plant
if you're never home?

05:12.187 --> 05:14.189
I'm not never home. I just--

05:14.857 --> 05:19.027
How about if you find me
something a little less needy?

05:20.988 --> 05:25.033
Right. Why not just get a plastic plant?

05:25.117 --> 05:26.285
That's sad.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.911
Well, not as sad as killing a plant.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.415
And some of the new ones,
they look totally real.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.834
No amount of neglect will kill them.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.335
Neglect?

05:36.420 --> 05:38.338
You know what, I'm gonna get this one.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.966
-Yep.
-Thank you.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.683
Sorry, I can't sell you this plant.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.102
I can't sell it to you in good conscience.

05:52.186 --> 05:55.939
Good conscience?
What are you, the patron saint of plants?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.400
I just don't feel comfortable
selling a plant to someone

05:58.483 --> 05:59.568
that can be so indifferent

05:59.651 --> 06:00.986
-towards a living thing.
-Indifferent?

06:01.069 --> 06:02.988
Is this how you speak
to all your customers?

06:03.071 --> 06:05.115
'Cause if you do,
I'm shocked that you sell anything at all.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.159
No, as a matter of fact,
this isn't even my stall.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.577
I just don't wanna be an accomplice…

06:08.660 --> 06:10.704
You're refusing to sell me a plant
that you don't even own?

06:10.787 --> 06:11.914
-That's right.
-Hey, Cole.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.957
-What's going on?
-Hi.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.918
-Are these your plants?
-Yes.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.420
Awesome. 'Cause Farmer Clown here
won't sell me one.

06:18.504 --> 06:21.048
-Farmer Clown. That's funny.
-The plant is $10, honey.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.841
Edna, sh--

06:22.925 --> 06:26.386
All right, you know what?
Hey, want a plant? Here. Cactus.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.139
Requires the bare minimum love
a human can give,

06:29.223 --> 06:30.974
so you'll totally kill it.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.021
You should fire him.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.024
-She's just gonna…
-Have a good one.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.526
RIP, little guy.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.529
-Can you believe that?
-No.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.114
I thought for sure you two
were gonna exchange numbers.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.824
-What?
-Yes.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.577
I thought, under all that stupid fighting,
you were flirting.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.871
-Wait, we were flirting?
-Are you kidding me?

06:52.955 --> 06:57.084
Are you high?
The sexual tension was off the charts.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.673
Edna, watch my stall.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.384
Hey, hey, hey, sorr--

07:05.467 --> 07:07.886
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
-Shit.

07:08.554 --> 07:13.892
Hi. Hi. Yep, it's me.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.519
Sorry. Just…

07:17.688 --> 07:19.940
Are you here to rescue the plant?

07:20.023 --> 07:22.276
No. No, I'm not. That's funny.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.152
No, I was just--

07:25.362 --> 07:26.738
Well, I was just wondering
if you wanted to,

07:27.948 --> 07:30.158
you know, go out sometime.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.871
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.706
Yeah, I mean, I--

07:36.832 --> 07:38.625
I mean, I know we were kind of…

07:39.126 --> 07:40.294
arguing back there,

07:40.377 --> 07:43.797
but I thought that underneath it,
there was…

07:45.924 --> 07:46.842
something.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.636
Something?

07:49.720 --> 07:51.513
Yeah.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.349
I'm wrong, aren't I?

07:56.351 --> 07:57.686
Well, this is embarrassing.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.109
Sorry, sorry. I misread it.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.207
I can use a coffee.

08:18.290 --> 08:22.377
A coffee?
You want to get a-- Yeah. Like, now?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.505
Yes, now.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.424
Get in.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.593
Yeah, well-- Yeah. Yeah.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.350
-I'm Cole, by the way.
-Seat belt.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.184
Yep, yep, yep. Sorry.

08:40.604 --> 08:41.897
I'll just hang on.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.025
Okay.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.831
I like the canal.
It reminds me of Amsterdam.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.626
So, art curators travel a lot?

09:02.709 --> 09:05.379
Oh, yeah. All over the world.

09:07.506 --> 09:08.924
I love it.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.177
Just jumping on a plane, moment's notice,

09:12.261 --> 09:15.681
and then, you know,
stepping out into a new place.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.225
Wow.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.187
Oh, gosh,
don't tell me you're one of those big,

09:22.271 --> 09:24.898
tough guys who's afraid
to leave the country.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.568
Okay, first of all,
thank you for calling me big and tough.

09:27.651 --> 09:31.071
Let's keep that going.
And I travel. I travel a lot.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.949
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.243
Yeah, I think the trips
that you plan the least

09:36.326 --> 09:37.995
are the ones that give you the most.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.457
I agree.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.838
Lincoln got shot just across
the street, and he died right next door.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.882
Sounds like you're a big fan of Lincoln.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.217
Well, history in general.

09:52.718 --> 09:55.012
I majored in agriculture,
but I minored in history.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.221
That's my real passion.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.640
You know, I'm writing a book.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.310
-You are?
-Yeah.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.354
History of farming?

10:04.897 --> 10:08.317
No, it's about the rise
and fall of different empires

10:08.400 --> 10:10.527
and the critical role that agriculture--

10:11.111 --> 10:12.529
Yeah, it's about farming.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.490
So how's it going?

10:16.325 --> 10:18.952
Well, it's on pause for now.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.664
My dad got hurt a few years ago,
so I came back to help him with the farm.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.875
So not a lot of time for writing.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.211
I'm sorry.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.588
It's okay. I'll finish it.

10:31.882 --> 10:34.510
You've never seen The Exorcist?
It's a classic.

10:34.593 --> 10:38.388
It's one of the scariest movies ever made,
and they filmed it right here.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.265
I don't know.
I don't get scared by movies.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.935
Yeah,
because you haven't seen The Exorcist.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.437
No, 'cause you can choose
not being scared.

10:46.021 --> 10:49.066
Okay. Little bet. Race me to the top.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.486
And if I beat you,
you gotta tell me what scares you.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.907
-I love this.
-All right. I like the confidence.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.743
Hang on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me just-- Hang on.

11:01.203 --> 11:04.248
Come on. Put all that in here.

11:04.331 --> 11:08.168
Are you gonna carry all my stuff?
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.963
You looking for pity?

11:11.046 --> 11:13.048
That's exactly what I'm looking for.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.093
Oh, my friend.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.887
-You ready?
-Yeah.

11:18.971 --> 11:21.014
And go!

11:42.619 --> 11:44.121
You know, I'm guessing you work out.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.456
Are you okay?

11:47.082 --> 11:48.083
Oh, yeah.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.633
Oh, my God. I love Monet.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.064
So you can just choose not
to be scared, huh?

12:15.819 --> 12:16.945
When I was six,

12:17.029 --> 12:19.823
my mom and I fled our country…

12:21.325 --> 12:22.409
on a raft.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.495
Oh, my God. That must have been--

12:25.579 --> 12:27.247
Worse than you can imagine.

12:28.624 --> 12:33.921
The sun, the waves,
sharks, people screaming, crying.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.632
I was terrified. Everyone was.

12:36.715 --> 12:41.178
They wanted to go back,
but my mom was so strong.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.933
She kept us all going for five days,

12:47.601 --> 12:48.977
until we made it.

12:50.270 --> 12:54.024
And I still remember how they looked
at her on the beach.

12:55.025 --> 12:59.363
I just, you know, wanted to be like her,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.532
strong and brave.

13:02.574 --> 13:07.371
So that's the day I decided I was never
going to be afraid ever again.

13:09.665 --> 13:10.707
And I'm not.

13:15.504 --> 13:16.630
I believe you.

13:18.257 --> 13:21.385
But it is very cute that you're scared
of this movie with the little girl.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.680
-Oh, my God. This is my own fault.
-That's-- What's the name again?

13:24.763 --> 13:26.306
-It's The Exorcist.
-I have to watch it now.

13:26.390 --> 13:29.101
One of the scariest movies of all time.
You're gonna have nightmares for a month.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.185
-Wow.
-Just watch.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.859
This has just been incredible.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.110
It was great.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.904
And not to be too forward,

13:40.988 --> 13:44.324
but if you ever felt
like getting a drink sometime…

13:44.408 --> 13:45.409
How about now?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.036
Okay.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.330
I know a great place.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.466
Hey!

14:09.141 --> 14:10.684
Thank you.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.187
You are amazing.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.230
How do you make that look cool?

14:15.314 --> 14:17.316
That's rockaoke. No dignity here.

14:17.399 --> 14:21.236
And next up, we have Cole Turner,
turnin' up the heat

14:21.862 --> 14:24.239
-with "20th Century Boy."
-What happened?

14:25.657 --> 14:28.285
-No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
-I might have put your name down.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.912
-Come on, Cole.
-Sadie. Sadie.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.039
Sadie,
I get nervous singing in the shower.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.540
-Just give it a go.
-I'm not a performer.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.792
-Cole! Cole! Cole!
-Cole Turner.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.086
-Where is Cole Turner?
-Please.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.463
I can't.

14:40.631 --> 14:42.674
He's not gonna do it.
Just call someone else.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.135
Give me the mic.

14:48.805 --> 14:49.765
Thank you.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.951
Now, you're out there,
seeing the world, traveling,

15:09.993 --> 15:13.705
meeting interesting people.
It's quite a life.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.167
Lately, I'm not so sure.

15:18.961 --> 15:22.631
Someone I know just died. A coworker.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.093
It got me thinking.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.556
You know, there are all
these things you want in life…

15:31.557 --> 15:34.977
and it's so hard to find someone who--

15:38.897 --> 15:41.692
If only people
could be more like your cactus.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.569
Not needing watering all the time?

15:44.695 --> 15:46.154
Right. Exactly.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.991
-Just living their own lives.
-Yeah.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.660
Not needing someone else,
like, nourishing them.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.537
That makes sense.

16:33.911 --> 16:34.912
Morning.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.081
-What?
-Nothing.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.461
Good night then.

16:42.544 --> 16:43.795
I mean, good morning.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.380
This was quite a date.

16:45.464 --> 16:46.882
You mean a day?

16:47.591 --> 16:51.178
Right. Yeah, that's-- Officially.
That's a first.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.930
Yeah, me too.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.937
Well, goodbye.

17:01.605 --> 17:02.731
Goodbye.

17:19.790 --> 17:25.045
Well, I look forward to our next day.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.093
-Bye.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.235
Be a cactus.

17:48.318 --> 17:52.739
No big moves. No big moves.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.700
Be a cactus.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.157
Wow.

18:37.659 --> 18:38.994
First farmer?

18:42.497 --> 18:43.498
Yeah.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.919
You know that power you felt?
That's from the land.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.407
Hey, Coleslaw.

19:17.491 --> 19:18.575
Hey, Dad.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.744
Thanks for closing up the stand
for me last night.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.372
Not a problem.
Edna gave me a hand. She was high.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.041
Look who's finally home.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.501
God, take it easy, Mom.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.336
He just got back
from having sex with a stranger,

19:29.419 --> 19:30.879
not fighting the Germans.

19:30.963 --> 19:34.466
Okay, now, come on. Spill the beans.

19:34.550 --> 19:38.262
Well, her name is Sadie, and she is…

19:40.138 --> 19:43.225
She's incredible.
I mean, I know this sounds a little crazy,

19:43.308 --> 19:47.145
but I think she might be the one.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.857
Really? Well, that's fast.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.900
Well, I can't wait to meet her.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.278
Did you tell her you wrestled
in high school?

19:54.361 --> 19:56.822
-No.
-What is this?

19:56.905 --> 19:59.658
You took a selfie
in bed while she was asleep?

19:59.741 --> 20:00.951
Dude, that's weird.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.745
That's what serial killers do
before they kill their victims

20:03.829 --> 20:04.955
and harvest their eyelids.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.374
I was happy.
I wanted to preserve the moment.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.377
-He is doing it again.
-Doing what?

20:10.460 --> 20:13.755
It's just-- Cole, you can get a bit--

20:13.839 --> 20:14.965
Smothering, needy, pathetic,

20:15.048 --> 20:16.300
-desperate, delusional.
-What?

20:16.383 --> 20:19.678
Yeah, stuff like this.
The stupid gifts, the constant texting.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.889
I mean, that's why things never
worked out with Fiona.

20:21.972 --> 20:23.182
Fiona was a bitch.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.101
You're a hopeless romantic,
just like your mom.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.811
Tell her you wrestled in high school.

20:27.895 --> 20:31.023
Look, I'm not needy,
and I'm not smothering.

20:31.106 --> 20:34.693
And for your information,
I've sent Sadie one text today. One.

20:36.612 --> 20:40.657
Three. And some light emoji stuff,
but that doesn't count.

20:40.741 --> 20:41.992
Emoji stuff counts.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.037
He is gonna blow it. Mark my words.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.121
I'm not gonna bl--

20:47.581 --> 20:48.832
She really is great.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.418
You'll see.

21:14.775 --> 21:19.446
Hey. Head in the game, Coleslaw.
Come on. A lot of honey to harvest.

21:33.961 --> 21:34.920
You need some slack?

21:35.546 --> 21:39.341
We're good. Hang on.
Just gotta hook it in. One sec.

21:41.009 --> 21:46.682
Should I get it? I can get it.
It's right here. So easy for me.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.352
Hello?

21:55.691 --> 21:56.817
Good news.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.236
Mortgage refinancing rates
have never been lower.

22:12.916 --> 22:13.917
Any word?

22:17.171 --> 22:18.672
Maybe your phone's broken.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.340
Yeah, maybe you should do a hard reset.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.718
There's nothing wrong with my phone.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.928
No, no, no, I meant with your life.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.556
You know, grow a pair,
move out of your parents' house.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.682
Guesthouse.

22:29.683 --> 22:32.311
Well, I'm sure
there's a logical reason for it.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.687
There is.

22:33.770 --> 22:37.065
He came off way too strong,
so she ghosted him.

22:37.149 --> 22:38.150
Ghosted?

22:38.233 --> 22:40.694
Yeah.
It's when someone breaks off all contact.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.780
For example, let's just say a young lady
makes a horrible,

22:43.864 --> 22:45.199
horrible mistake one night,

22:45.282 --> 22:48.785
and then the guy just keeps
on texting her with emojis,

22:48.869 --> 22:50.495
over and over.

22:50.579 --> 22:52.539
She did not ghost me, okay?

22:54.208 --> 22:55.709
-She did.
-You wanna pick this up?

22:55.792 --> 22:56.919
No.

22:57.002 --> 23:00.714
Hey, pal, you're huffing and puffing.
Why don't you take a hit off your scuba?

23:01.340 --> 23:03.592
Come on, hey. Let's go.

23:07.513 --> 23:08.597
Oh, my God.

23:10.349 --> 23:13.685
Sorry. You did the leave-behind
with your inhaler?

23:13.769 --> 23:16.396
Come on.
Isn't your asthma sad enough already?

23:16.480 --> 23:18.649
It wasn't a leave-behind.
I forgot it in her purse.

23:18.732 --> 23:22.694
And it has one of those tiles on it.
Those tracking things that I use.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.657
All right. Drumroll, please.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.201
The woman of my dreams is in…

23:30.994 --> 23:32.371
-London.
-England?

23:32.454 --> 23:35.499
-London, the Lady in the Mist.
-No one calls it that.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.001
-The Gray Lady.
-No, that's New York Times.

23:38.085 --> 23:40.254
-Are ya sure?
-Yes.

23:40.337 --> 23:41.755
She does travel a lot for work.

23:41.839 --> 23:43.590
Well, there you go. That makes sense.

23:43.674 --> 23:46.593
She probably got called away last minute
on this job and had to rush over there.

23:46.677 --> 23:49.388
You know,
international calling plans and whatnot.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.348
I bet she hasn't even seen your texts.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.684
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.686
-Exactly.
-Okay, so this is fine?

23:55.769 --> 23:57.187
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

23:57.271 --> 24:00.190
Cole, you should go over there.

24:00.274 --> 24:03.318
-What?
-Yeah, show up and surprise her.

24:03.402 --> 24:06.530
It'd be a romantic gesture,
something we can tell our grandchildren.

24:06.613 --> 24:10.033
Mom, you can't be serious.
Cole, going to London? No.

24:10.117 --> 24:12.286
Why not? This is a perfect opportunity

24:12.369 --> 24:15.998
to get out there
and grab life by the horns.

24:16.081 --> 24:17.249
She's gonna think you're psycho.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.460
Or she'll think that I'm the kind of guy

24:20.544 --> 24:22.546
that's willing to jump
on a plane at a moment's notice.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.132
Wait, but you're not that kind of guy.
You do not travel anywhere.

24:25.215 --> 24:27.217
-You haven't even left the country.
-That's not true.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.886
He was conceived in Ontario.

24:28.969 --> 24:30.429
Cole, you can do this.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.264
Yeah, but what about the farm?
There's so much to do.

24:32.347 --> 24:35.434
-I can't just leave you here.
-Coleslaw, don't worry about the farm.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.936
-Yeah.
-By the horns. Come on.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.229
Yeah, go to her.

24:41.315 --> 24:42.316
You know what I have?

24:42.399 --> 24:45.027
You remember that spring break
where I was supposed to go to Spain

24:45.110 --> 24:46.820
and I gave up my seat and I got a voucher?

24:46.904 --> 24:48.697
That is my point exactly, Cole.

24:48.780 --> 24:52.284
You missed spring break
to get a stupid voucher,

24:52.367 --> 24:54.411
which you never used.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.663
I mean, that is the type of guy you are.

24:56.747 --> 24:57.789
Not today.

24:57.873 --> 25:01.376
-You still have--
-I've got goose bumps.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.003
Thanks for the warning.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.588
I'm going to London.

25:13.555 --> 25:17.559
So it's not like a weird stalker thing.
It's just a grand romantic gesture.

25:17.643 --> 25:20.938
Yeah, that is amazing, mate.
I mean, I admire your confidence.

25:21.021 --> 25:24.858
5,000 miles to surprise a girl
who you've only met once.

25:24.942 --> 25:26.818
I mean,
that is the epitome of romance, mate.

25:26.902 --> 25:28.570
Yeah, exactly. See, you get it.

25:28.654 --> 25:30.864
Especially if she's the one
who ghosted you.

25:30.948 --> 25:33.575
I was-- Wait, what?
No, no, she didn't ghost me.

25:33.659 --> 25:35.619
She just doesn't
have an international calling plan.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.412
Right.

25:37.496 --> 25:41.416
An international art curator,
doesn't have an overseas calling plan.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.626
That's very unusual.

25:44.253 --> 25:45.587
Talking of romantic gestures,

25:45.671 --> 25:47.464
what's that you got in the back then, hey?

25:47.548 --> 25:49.508
-Is it a little cactus, is it?
-Yeah.

25:49.591 --> 25:53.428
Yeah, this is a little inside joke
between us.

25:53.512 --> 25:56.557
Little cactus.
I'm sure she'll split her sides laughing.

25:59.518 --> 26:04.648
Right, we are nearly here. Tower Bridge.

26:09.945 --> 26:12.197
That'll be 137 quid, please.

26:13.407 --> 26:16.326
-That's kind of a lot, isn't it?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's outrageous.

26:16.410 --> 26:19.079
You never get a cab from the airport
to the center of London.

26:19.162 --> 26:22.666
It'll cost you a small fortune, mate.
Yeah. Toodle-pip.

26:33.844 --> 26:36.180
Take care, now. Thanks very much.

26:37.431 --> 26:41.518
Have a good evening. Have a good night.

28:07.354 --> 28:12.818
Let me tell you how
this will be. One for you, 19 for me.

28:13.318 --> 28:16.029
'Cause I'm the taxman.

28:16.780 --> 28:17.865
Listen to me.

28:17.948 --> 28:21.493
I can't believe I'm quoting
"The Taxman" to you.

28:21.577 --> 28:25.706
So lame. I really am turning into my dad.

28:25.789 --> 28:27.207
It's true what they say.

28:27.291 --> 28:31.378
When you meet a celebrity,
your IQ drops 50 points.

28:32.171 --> 28:34.798
-Where am I?
-It's just-- You're a living legend.

28:34.882 --> 28:37.509
Stopping our shipment in Turkey,

28:37.593 --> 28:39.261
the assassination in Berlin

28:39.887 --> 28:42.890
and now this thing with Elena
and the passcode.

28:42.973 --> 28:47.895
The boss talks about you all the time.
You've become an obsession for him.

28:47.978 --> 28:52.024
"The Taxman killed Elena.
The Taxman has the passcode.

28:52.107 --> 28:55.819
Oh, how I want to find
and murder the Taxman."

28:55.903 --> 28:57.738
And now here you are.

28:57.821 --> 29:00.365
No, no, I'm not a taxman. I'm a farmer.

29:00.449 --> 29:05.412
I came to London to surprise a girl,
and these guys, they jumped me.

29:05.495 --> 29:06.788
Textbook evasion.

29:06.872 --> 29:10.501
Frankly, a little disappointing,
but the performance?

29:10.584 --> 29:11.710
Sublime.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.879
It's like you truly believe
what you're saying.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.255
Because I'm telling the truth.

29:15.339 --> 29:17.466
You have the wrong guy.
My name is Cole Turner.

29:17.549 --> 29:19.760
My passport's right over there in the bag,
in the front flap.

29:19.843 --> 29:24.515
Sublime.
It truly is an honor to torture you today.

29:25.224 --> 29:27.684
Okay, just wait. Wait.

29:27.768 --> 29:31.063
-Normally, I begin with the punching.
-Wait a minute.

29:32.981 --> 29:36.360
You see, it causes me a little pain too.

29:36.443 --> 29:39.613
I'm all about sharing the experience.

29:39.696 --> 29:42.199
My therapist says that I'm an empath,

29:42.282 --> 29:46.036
which means that I'm deeply attuned
to others' feelings.

29:47.079 --> 29:52.543
But alas, the boss is in a real tizzy
about the passcode.

29:54.378 --> 29:58.465
Are you familiar
with the Schmidt sting pain index?

29:58.549 --> 30:01.093
Wait, the what? Wait a minute.

30:01.176 --> 30:06.515
It's a rating system for the pain
caused by the bites and stings of insects.

30:07.307 --> 30:10.561
From the simple ouch
of the western honeybee

30:10.644 --> 30:15.274
to the spray-and-pray
of the Latin American bullet ant

30:16.108 --> 30:19.570
that you can see primed
and ready in that box on the table.

30:20.237 --> 30:23.198
Spray-and-pray is short
for "spray in your pants

30:23.991 --> 30:27.160
and pray for the merciful release
of death."

30:27.244 --> 30:28.453
Excuse me, sir,

30:29.371 --> 30:31.248
will you just grab that bag
for me quickly?

30:31.331 --> 30:33.375
I promise,
this is just a big misunderstanding--

30:33.458 --> 30:37.713
Normally, we like to start slow
and build our way up.

30:37.796 --> 30:40.382
But you are special,

30:41.049 --> 30:46.597
so we begin with the murder hornet.

30:47.681 --> 30:49.600
Shit. Shit.

30:50.434 --> 30:54.229
Unless, of course,
you want to reveal the passcode.

30:54.313 --> 30:57.024
I don't know any passcode!
I'm telling you, you have the wrong guy.

30:57.107 --> 30:58.150
My name is Cole Turner.

30:58.233 --> 31:00.068
Just look at the passport.
It's right there in the bag.

31:00.152 --> 31:03.655
That's just great.
This is going to be fun.

31:04.698 --> 31:07.159
For me, not for you.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.912
Holy shit. Holy shit. Wait, wait--

31:10.495 --> 31:12.247
God. Shit! Shit!

31:19.087 --> 31:20.380
You.

31:27.638 --> 31:28.847
Can you walk?

31:28.931 --> 31:31.475
-What?
-Can you walk, Cole?

31:33.018 --> 31:33.936
Sadie.

31:37.731 --> 31:41.944
Head down, mouth closed.
Follow me before anyone sounds the alarm.

31:44.655 --> 31:48.158
-Know how to use a gun?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But--

31:48.242 --> 31:52.788
Shoot anyone who's not me.
Stay on my six. Let's go.

31:56.792 --> 31:58.544
Sadie. Geez.

31:59.837 --> 32:02.381
Sadie, what the hell is going on?
Who are these people?

32:02.464 --> 32:04.132
Bad guys.

32:04.216 --> 32:06.885
They set a trap for one of our agents,
and you fell into it.

32:06.969 --> 32:09.304
Agents. Art agents?

32:09.388 --> 32:11.098
-Over here.
-Down!

32:13.934 --> 32:16.228
Not an art agent. Got it.

32:18.355 --> 32:21.608
Sorry, there's a lot going on.
Plus those guys drugged me.

32:23.610 --> 32:24.695
Who are you?

32:24.778 --> 32:28.240
CIA. At least,
until they find out about this fiasco.

32:29.157 --> 32:30.576
Keep moving.

32:32.703 --> 32:34.788
My God, you're a spy!

32:37.124 --> 32:38.792
Do you actually know where you're going?

32:42.087 --> 32:43.380
Get down!

32:46.675 --> 32:47.676
Behind you!

32:52.556 --> 32:53.473
You hurt?

32:54.516 --> 32:58.145
No, it's the most amazing thing I've--

32:59.605 --> 33:02.900
I'm so confused.
They kept asking me about the Taxman.

33:02.983 --> 33:06.403
-They asked you about the Taxman?
-No, they think I am a Taxman.

33:06.486 --> 33:08.530
They think you're the Taxman?

33:08.614 --> 33:10.866
That the Taxman would actually fall
for that lazy trap?

33:10.949 --> 33:13.202
They caught the Taxman, and it's you?

33:17.998 --> 33:19.625
-You're the Taxman!
-Oh, my God.

33:20.167 --> 33:21.335
Oh, my God!

33:22.169 --> 33:23.545
All right. Check down here.

33:26.215 --> 33:27.299
Freeze!

33:39.019 --> 33:40.479
Shoot him!

33:41.438 --> 33:42.689
-Hey, hey!
-Shoot him!

33:42.773 --> 33:44.191
Just stick 'em up.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.615
You said you could shoot!

33:51.698 --> 33:53.492
At tin cans, not people.

33:56.245 --> 33:57.704
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

34:00.874 --> 34:01.917
Here.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.002
There! Go!

34:06.922 --> 34:08.130
-Move! Move!
-Where they at?

34:11.092 --> 34:13.053
Art curator, my ass.

34:13.136 --> 34:17.224
I thought you were different too.
Sweet, fun, low-maintenance.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.810
I can't believe I was gonna call you
when I got back.

34:22.437 --> 34:23.856
Cover me.

34:38.911 --> 34:39.913
Cole.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.045
Were you really gonna call me
when you got back?

34:49.089 --> 34:52.759
Yes, until you texted me 11 times
in two days.

34:52.842 --> 34:56.388
-Seven. Emoji stuff doesn't count.
-Yes, it does.

34:57.014 --> 34:59.308
Emoji stuff counts. Move.

35:24.041 --> 35:26.335
-Come on.
-Where the hell are we?

35:42.309 --> 35:44.770
Jump! Cole, come on!

35:50.234 --> 35:52.694
-I swallowed a rock.
-Keep going!

36:11.296 --> 36:12.339
Cover me.

36:20.556 --> 36:21.557
Stop!

36:22.683 --> 36:23.642
Get off the bus.

36:37.072 --> 36:38.198
Come on!

36:45.622 --> 36:47.875
-You're never gonna make it through.
-We're not going that way.

36:56.967 --> 36:59.136
Do you know what you're doing?
Have you done this before?

36:59.219 --> 37:00.637
I'm gonna let you think yes.

37:26.079 --> 37:30.292
I cannot believe you got me kidnapped
and tortured all after one date.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.085
You're the one who flew to London.

37:43.639 --> 37:44.848
Holy shit!

37:50.938 --> 37:52.689
-You are unbelievable!
-What?

37:52.773 --> 37:55.484
You stalkered your way across the ocean
to find me.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.653
That is not cactus behavior!

38:00.364 --> 38:01.949
Don't use stalker as a verb.

38:02.574 --> 38:04.409
And it was a romantic gesture!

38:10.332 --> 38:11.875
I checked your records.

38:11.959 --> 38:13.377
You've never even left the country.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.881
You checked my records?
Who's stalkering now?

39:53.268 --> 39:54.728
Sadie!

40:24.007 --> 40:25.717
Look out!

40:33.267 --> 40:35.644
-Choke him out.
-They usually tap.

40:35.727 --> 40:38.522
He's not going to tap. Just choke him out.

41:23.817 --> 41:25.819
Cole! Are you comfortable?

41:25.903 --> 41:26.904
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

42:15.244 --> 42:16.537
Is that what I think it is?

42:16.620 --> 42:18.163
It was meant to be a joke.

42:19.206 --> 42:21.875
It was a lot funnier
before I used it to kill a man.

42:27.089 --> 42:28.090
Hey.

42:29.800 --> 42:30.801
Time to walk.

42:36.932 --> 42:38.016
Great khans,

42:39.142 --> 42:40.978
they used to cross these lands.

42:42.145 --> 42:43.230
Brutal killers.

42:47.025 --> 42:50.195
It was said if you wanted to find one,

42:51.989 --> 42:53.448
you had to step over the dead.

42:53.949 --> 42:58.537
The Taxman has a face.
No matches in the intelligence databases.

42:59.621 --> 43:00.998
They must be running him off the books.

43:02.457 --> 43:03.458
Clever.

43:04.626 --> 43:06.920
I've got blood on my hands.

43:07.004 --> 43:10.340
It's the blood of bad men.
We did what we had to.

43:11.300 --> 43:13.093
Is that what you tell yourself?

43:13.177 --> 43:14.386
You're a liar.

43:15.554 --> 43:17.139
I'm not the liar here.

43:18.348 --> 43:20.809
I told you things I've never told anyone.

43:21.643 --> 43:22.936
It was all true.

43:24.271 --> 43:25.522
Not all of it!

43:29.109 --> 43:31.737
Okay, one lie about my job.

43:33.030 --> 43:35.324
I really ate it up too, didn't I?

43:35.407 --> 43:37.993
Especially that sob story
about your coworker that died.

43:38.076 --> 43:39.203
That is low.

43:40.078 --> 43:43.165
That was actually true.
Her name was Elena.

43:43.248 --> 43:44.958
And she really died?

43:48.170 --> 43:49.505
I may have killed her.

43:50.547 --> 43:51.590
What?

43:52.841 --> 43:54.635
She was an enemy agent.

43:55.385 --> 43:56.595
She worked for these guys.

43:56.678 --> 43:58.180
You said she was a coworker.

43:58.263 --> 43:59.806
She was. In a loose sense.

43:59.890 --> 44:01.767
See, this is what I'm talking about.

44:01.850 --> 44:05.229
-It's just lies and lies and more lies.
-It's not lies and more lies.

44:05.312 --> 44:07.439
It's the sub-lie
of the first original lie.

44:07.523 --> 44:09.858
-You're unbelievable.
-Hey.

44:10.859 --> 44:12.694
Fine, I lied about my job.

44:12.778 --> 44:14.446
But you lied about who you are.

44:14.530 --> 44:16.823
Well, excuse me for fudging a few details

44:16.907 --> 44:19.660
to try and impress
the most amazing woman I've ever met.

44:22.079 --> 44:24.623
-Please.
-Who apparently kills coworkers.

44:24.706 --> 44:27.709
Oh, my God!
She killed innocent people, Cole!

44:29.670 --> 44:31.964
Do you know what? I am done with you.

44:32.714 --> 44:35.425
Head down, shut your mouth
and follow my lead.

44:36.176 --> 44:39.179
The sooner I get rid of you,
the sooner I get back to the mission.

44:39.263 --> 44:40.347
Fine. You know what?

44:40.430 --> 44:43.767
I just want to get away from you
and out of here as fast as possible.

44:43.851 --> 44:44.685
You should.

44:44.768 --> 44:48.355
'Cause I've tangled with these guys
before, and they are ruthless.

44:48.438 --> 44:52.609
And now they think you're me,
so they're looking for you, Taxman.

45:02.411 --> 45:05.998
I'll speak with Utami. Buy us some time.

45:15.465 --> 45:17.384
And the passcode?

45:17.467 --> 45:20.137
Looks like Borislov was too slow.

45:20.220 --> 45:21.221
As usual.

45:22.931 --> 45:25.392
But I finally know
what the Taxman looks like,

45:25.475 --> 45:26.476
so I'll find him.

45:29.313 --> 45:30.689
What is this?

45:32.316 --> 45:33.817
He doesn't know anything.

45:38.155 --> 45:42.034
We cannot afford this kind of failure.

45:46.163 --> 45:49.458
The game we play, it's like no other.

45:54.630 --> 45:56.256
If we succeed,

45:57.299 --> 46:00.260
we have wealth, power.

46:02.095 --> 46:05.474
And if we fail, we die.

46:05.557 --> 46:07.851
And that is only if we're lucky.

46:07.935 --> 46:08.977
No, please.

46:10.562 --> 46:13.065
-Please help me.
-No more mistakes.

46:13.857 --> 46:14.858
No.

46:24.159 --> 46:27.788
Get that photo to every bounty hunter
on the continent.

46:28.455 --> 46:30.332
One million dollars. Alive.

46:30.415 --> 46:32.709
He is our only access to that code.

46:32.793 --> 46:37.422
Anyone kills the Taxman,
that bounty moves onto their head.

47:11.456 --> 47:12.457
Be right back.

47:56.210 --> 47:57.794
Just like your farmers' market.

47:59.379 --> 48:00.380
Come on.

48:04.218 --> 48:05.427
Where are you taking me?

48:06.094 --> 48:08.764
Back to your farm,
unless you screw this up.

48:11.016 --> 48:12.017
Stay close.

48:26.198 --> 48:27.199
Be cool.

48:46.093 --> 48:47.094
How you doing?

48:50.305 --> 48:52.349
What? Friendly isn't cool?

48:53.016 --> 48:56.520
Well, well, well, Sadie sunflower.

48:56.603 --> 48:58.480
-Marco.
-Look at you.

49:04.111 --> 49:05.279
Who's your friend?

49:05.988 --> 49:09.157
-I'm--
-He's a civilian I just recovered.

49:11.785 --> 49:13.954
You look ravenous, mate.

49:14.037 --> 49:16.874
Let me put something inside you.

49:16.957 --> 49:17.958
Come on.

49:21.211 --> 49:22.754
Sit down, sit down. Come on, sit down.

49:23.672 --> 49:26.925
The scrap out at the caves.
I should have known that was you.

49:28.135 --> 49:30.721
It was the same people that stole Aztec.

49:31.638 --> 49:33.765
-What's Aztec?
-A biochemical weapon.

49:33.849 --> 49:37.644
Very nasty. Deadly enough
to wipe out the Eastern Seaboard.

49:37.728 --> 49:38.562
That's classified.

49:38.645 --> 49:39.897
They're going to sell it.

49:41.565 --> 49:42.566
Thank you for filling me in.

49:42.649 --> 49:45.611
And they're using those caves
with highly paid protection.

49:45.694 --> 49:47.905
There's only one man
that can pull this off.

49:47.988 --> 49:50.782
Leveque. Disgraced French intelligence.

49:50.866 --> 49:53.327
Played in this sandbox
for most of the war,

49:53.410 --> 49:56.955
and then he went into business
for himself. Arms deals, assassinations.

49:57.539 --> 50:00.209
If he's your target, be careful.
He's a dangerous man.

50:01.210 --> 50:03.754
Anyway, mate, best chaat in town.

50:03.837 --> 50:05.088
Enjoy it.

50:05.172 --> 50:09.134
This is yours, sunflower.
Extra spicy. Just how you like it.

50:13.222 --> 50:17.768
So, are you two, you know, a couple?

50:17.851 --> 50:19.061
-Yeah.
-No.

50:19.144 --> 50:20.687
-Yes. Yeah.
-No.

50:20.771 --> 50:22.814
-It was like five months.
-A long time.

50:23.524 --> 50:26.109
You know, we had a lot in common.
You know, work. Not work.

50:26.193 --> 50:27.402
Hey, Mahmoud.

50:27.486 --> 50:28.820
Got it. Subtle.

50:31.990 --> 50:34.034
It's not that.
It's just that sometimes it's easier

50:34.117 --> 50:35.536
to date someone in the same profession.

50:35.619 --> 50:36.453
Always.

50:37.204 --> 50:39.414
Although I wouldn't call
what we did dating.

50:39.498 --> 50:40.749
Please. Can we focus?

50:40.832 --> 50:42.167
Well, that's charming. Very cool.

50:42.251 --> 50:43.710
-Okay.
-Very cool.

50:44.336 --> 50:45.337
I need to find Aztec.

50:46.213 --> 50:49.299
And I need your guys to get Cole
back safely to America.

50:49.383 --> 50:52.344
-Who is he really?
-Nobody.

50:53.303 --> 50:54.346
He's a mistake.

50:55.389 --> 50:56.390
You're the mistake.

50:56.473 --> 50:58.016
She said she was an art curator.

50:58.976 --> 51:00.352
-Wait a second.
-Oh, my God.

51:00.936 --> 51:02.312
You said-- What?

51:02.396 --> 51:04.773
Is he your boyfriend?

51:04.857 --> 51:05.691
He's very funny.

51:05.774 --> 51:07.150
You poor bastard.

51:07.234 --> 51:09.695
You thought you met a hottie, right?
Not a Mata Hari.

51:09.778 --> 51:12.114
But, hey, at least the no pants dance
was worth it.

51:12.197 --> 51:14.408
-Oh, God.
-No, it wasn't.

51:14.491 --> 51:15.534
Come on.

51:15.617 --> 51:17.452
Oh, come on. It was. It was for me.

51:17.536 --> 51:18.704
And I lost a hand.

51:19.204 --> 51:20.163
Lost it.

51:20.747 --> 51:23.000
-Wait. You lo--
-Yeah, gone. It's fake.

51:23.083 --> 51:24.418
-Touch it.
-That's because of Sadie?

51:24.501 --> 51:27.462
-Yeah. You can touch it.
-No. I'm okay. How?

51:27.546 --> 51:28.839
When Sadie and I were together,

51:28.922 --> 51:31.300
we took a little
romantic getaway to Myanmar.

51:31.383 --> 51:33.260
No. It was a mission.

51:33.343 --> 51:34.720
There were many positions.

51:34.803 --> 51:37.514
Don't know if you remember, but anyway.
Things went south.

51:37.598 --> 51:40.559
I got captured, and Sadie took right off.

51:40.642 --> 51:43.896
Turns out that's exactly
what the secret police did to me.

51:43.979 --> 51:46.356
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, don't worry about it, man.

51:46.440 --> 51:48.859
You got two hands, right,
but only one life.

51:51.695 --> 51:53.614
You know what I miss most, mate? Guess.

52:00.287 --> 52:02.331
-Yeah.
-I used to do that all the time.

52:02.414 --> 52:03.707
Can't do it anymore, can I?

52:04.416 --> 52:07.669
Sorry. You left your boyfriend
to get his hand cut off.

52:07.753 --> 52:09.713
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Nothing.

52:10.422 --> 52:12.758
I'd have done the same. Mission over man.

52:12.841 --> 52:14.301
Right, sunflower?

52:14.384 --> 52:17.179
Surrounded by lunatics. Wait a minute.

52:17.262 --> 52:19.973
Did you come back to save me or get Aztec?

52:21.183 --> 52:22.893
You were a secondary objective.

52:22.976 --> 52:26.522
-Oh, my God.
-High-priority secondary, I'm sure.

52:26.605 --> 52:28.649
And look at you now, brother. Thriving.

52:28.732 --> 52:30.984
Every word you're saying
is making it worse.

52:31.068 --> 52:33.153
-Every word. I know you're trying. Just--
-Marco.

52:33.237 --> 52:34.738
-This guy.
-Hey.

52:34.821 --> 52:37.824
Are you gonna take him back home or not?

52:38.825 --> 52:39.785
Please say yes.

52:39.868 --> 52:43.956
I'd really hate it if one of my limbs
comes between Sadie and a clean exit.

52:45.749 --> 52:48.919
Sure. Sadie survivors
have to look after each other, right?

52:49.002 --> 52:50.003
Thank you.

52:50.087 --> 52:51.505
Honestly, thank you so much.

52:51.588 --> 52:52.673
You're welcome, babe. Kiss?

52:52.756 --> 52:53.757
No.

52:54.883 --> 52:56.051
No.

52:56.134 --> 52:57.302
Goodbye, Cole.

52:59.888 --> 53:01.807
I'm glad that you survived.

53:07.396 --> 53:09.147
I just wanna be very clear.

53:09.231 --> 53:12.025
Do not ever contact me again.

53:12.109 --> 53:14.778
-Okay?
-With pleasure.

53:15.529 --> 53:17.447
I've already forgotten your name.

53:17.531 --> 53:19.616
Which I'm sure by the way
is fake anyway, so…

53:24.162 --> 53:26.331
-Unbelievable.
-Tell me about it.

53:26.999 --> 53:29.960
She went for a normie,
but that's just lying to herself.

53:30.043 --> 53:31.420
-Yeah.
-Anyway, cheer up, mate.

53:31.503 --> 53:34.464
Stop staring at her. Stop crying.
You're safe now. Come on.

53:34.548 --> 53:36.341
We got a cheeky bottle-o in the back.

53:36.425 --> 53:38.886
On the piss, you and me get drunk,
get smashed.

53:38.969 --> 53:40.012
Alcohol in your mouth.

53:40.095 --> 53:42.556
This is my town. Nothing happens here
that I don't see coming a mile away.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.935
Everything but that I guess.

53:51.773 --> 53:54.067
Walk. Both of you.

53:57.362 --> 54:00.032
-Sorry about Marco.
-Stop talking before you get us killed.

54:00.115 --> 54:02.117
Don't worry. They want him alive.

54:02.201 --> 54:05.162
I don't know what your deal is,
but I'm sure they'll pay for you too.

54:05.245 --> 54:08.415
-They definitely will.
-Cole, shut up. Just--

54:08.916 --> 54:10.459
I'm trying to keep you alive.

54:10.542 --> 54:12.169
Would you rather I say
they wouldn't pay for you?

54:12.252 --> 54:14.004
This is so cute. Get a room.

54:14.087 --> 54:16.507
If it means anything, he's not the Taxman.

54:17.007 --> 54:19.968
Yeah, and I'm not the Grandson of Sam.

54:20.052 --> 54:23.680
Huh? Like the Son of Sam,
the serial killer, but next gen.

54:24.431 --> 54:25.891
I'm the best bounty hunter alive.

54:31.271 --> 54:32.356
Second best.

54:32.856 --> 54:34.316
That was very impressive.

54:37.653 --> 54:40.030
-Shall we?
-Yep, yep. Yep.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.909
You disappointed me, Taxman.
That was too easy.

54:43.992 --> 54:46.078
Now your lady friend's gonna die
'cause of you.

54:46.161 --> 54:48.747
That's funny.
Usually the other way around.

54:48.830 --> 54:50.249
It was you who followed me to Europe.

54:50.332 --> 54:51.875
Lured by your lying.

54:51.959 --> 54:53.669
God, you two need to get a room.

54:53.752 --> 54:56.088
We did. That's what got us into this mess.

54:56.171 --> 54:57.464
Okay, get in the car.

55:00.384 --> 55:02.886
Lady drives. Taxman, you're riding middle.

55:06.056 --> 55:07.432
Scooch, scooch.

55:09.226 --> 55:11.186
Well, Taxman it up.

55:11.270 --> 55:12.813
Don't use Taxman as a verb.

55:14.982 --> 55:16.525
You mind telling us who you are?

55:17.943 --> 55:19.403
They call me the Leopard.

55:21.363 --> 55:22.823
Oh, my God.

55:22.906 --> 55:24.408
Called him the Leopard.

55:24.491 --> 55:27.744
But even leopards get killed by lions,

55:27.828 --> 55:30.289
hyenas, lightning.

55:31.790 --> 55:32.749
Get him out.

55:38.547 --> 55:39.715
And drive.

55:45.262 --> 55:46.263
And who are you?

55:49.766 --> 55:51.727
God. The Bounty Hunter.

55:52.519 --> 55:55.689
Wow. You guys have really good names
in your world.

55:55.772 --> 55:59.193
It's like the WWE, but scarier.

56:03.155 --> 56:07.075
One twist of this ring will send
50,000 volts through your sorry ass.

56:08.368 --> 56:11.330
-Make you wish you were dead.
-Too late.

56:11.413 --> 56:13.957
This is great. Thank you for this.

56:14.041 --> 56:16.251
-Huh?
-No, I was just thinking how happy I am

56:16.335 --> 56:18.795
to have an electrified hockey puck
stuck to my neck with what,

56:18.879 --> 56:20.964
-50,000 volts ready to go into--
-I can't take this.

56:21.048 --> 56:22.633
-Volts into my--
-You really need to shut up.

56:22.716 --> 56:23.550
Wow.

56:23.634 --> 56:25.511
You two should get a room.

56:27.387 --> 56:28.847
You know what? Stop.

56:28.931 --> 56:30.098
Pull over here.

56:30.182 --> 56:31.225
My car is better.

56:40.692 --> 56:42.778
Look, I don't mean to
shake your confidence, God,

56:42.861 --> 56:44.404
but the last two guys didn't make it.

56:44.488 --> 56:45.906
My confidence doesn't shake.

56:46.532 --> 56:50.077
I spent years conditioning myself
to attuning my sense--

56:55.624 --> 56:58.085
Got you, suckers.

57:11.974 --> 57:15.477
If you're collecting the bounty,
where are they taking delivery?

57:24.486 --> 57:27.406
Listen, I'll stash you someplace safe.

57:27.489 --> 57:30.784
If I don't come back for you,
an extraction team will.

57:30.868 --> 57:34.413
So you're really gonna raid a plane
full of armed goons by yourself?

57:34.496 --> 57:37.791
I have to find Aztec. It's my only play.

57:38.750 --> 57:39.751
Wow.

57:45.841 --> 57:49.720
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry about Marco.

57:49.803 --> 57:51.346
God. Seriously?

57:52.181 --> 57:55.517
You know, I'm trying to connect
about a person that just died.

57:55.601 --> 57:57.227
Someone you knew well.

57:57.311 --> 57:59.521
Are you capable of that,
or is that only on first dates?

57:59.605 --> 58:03.317
The rest of the time, it's just
chemical weapons and passcodes

58:03.400 --> 58:04.818
and bullets and death.

58:04.902 --> 58:07.613
Wait, what passcodes?
What do you mean about passcodes?

58:07.696 --> 58:12.409
The bug guy in the cave
kept asking me about passcodes.

58:13.202 --> 58:14.494
Jesus!

58:16.121 --> 58:18.498
-He thinks I have the passcode?
-Yeah.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.167
And you're telling me this now?

58:20.250 --> 58:21.460
I'm sorry.

58:21.543 --> 58:24.046
I was slightly drugged and kidnapped
at the time.

58:24.129 --> 58:24.963
Unbelievable.

58:25.047 --> 58:27.674
Also, in case you forgot, I'm a farmer.

58:27.758 --> 58:29.426
I'm not a super spy.

58:29.510 --> 58:32.971
Why didn't you just ask me
what the torturer was torturing me about?

58:33.055 --> 58:34.348
You are unbelievable!

58:34.431 --> 58:36.141
What? What?

58:36.225 --> 58:37.935
What are the passcodes?

58:38.018 --> 58:40.854
The least you could do is tell me
what I almost died for.

58:43.815 --> 58:48.570
Aztec is inside a high-security case
that cannot be opened without a passcode.

58:48.654 --> 58:50.989
Elena figured out the DNA encryption.

58:51.073 --> 58:52.366
What do you mean, DNA encryption?

58:52.449 --> 58:55.953
The passcode is the entire genetic
sequence of a living organism.

58:56.036 --> 58:58.705
-Insanely long and unique.
-Wow.

58:58.789 --> 59:01.291
I got to Elena
before she could upload it to Leveque.

59:01.375 --> 59:03.043
So they think you have the passcode?

59:03.126 --> 59:06.004
But I don't because she destroyed it.

59:08.590 --> 59:10.175
But if Leveque
is trying to get it from me,

59:10.259 --> 59:12.135
that means he doesn't have it either.

59:12.636 --> 59:15.138
Which means he can't
hand the weapon over to his buyers.

59:15.222 --> 59:17.641
-Which means--
-He still has Aztec.

59:17.724 --> 59:20.018
Which means change of plans.

59:20.102 --> 59:21.353
Do you trust me?

59:21.436 --> 59:23.188
Is that a fucking joke?

59:23.730 --> 59:25.274
Thank you for your honesty.

59:38.453 --> 59:40.372
You're a f-- I cannot believe--

59:40.455 --> 59:43.125
'Cause I'm the taxman

59:44.793 --> 59:48.881
Yeah, I'm the taxman

59:50.465 --> 59:53.427
-Get it?
-The song? Very funny.

59:53.510 --> 59:56.513
You left an impressive trail of blood
bringing us our friend.

59:57.931 --> 1:00:00.184
-Well done.
-Thanks.

1:00:00.267 --> 1:00:01.810
But I don't get paid in compliments.

1:00:04.104 --> 1:00:06.523
You'll get your money, bounty hunter.

1:00:14.531 --> 1:00:16.158
So you're the Taxman.

1:00:16.992 --> 1:00:19.244
CIA's golden boy.

1:00:21.371 --> 1:00:25.083
Your pseudonym has generated
as much fun as you have.

1:00:25.709 --> 1:00:26.960
But I know you.

1:00:31.632 --> 1:00:34.176
I know you because I was you.

1:00:35.302 --> 1:00:36.803
Disposable.

1:00:37.471 --> 1:00:41.266
Except one day, I found myself

1:00:42.392 --> 1:00:46.396
bleeding out in a ditch
on the edge of Kabul.

1:00:51.693 --> 1:00:53.987
There was trash everywhere.

1:00:54.696 --> 1:00:58.408
And then suddenly, I got clarity.

1:01:00.077 --> 1:01:02.204
I had given them everything

1:01:03.455 --> 1:01:05.666
and sacrificed everything.

1:01:07.417 --> 1:01:09.837
It is a waste of life.

1:01:12.130 --> 1:01:13.257
And what are we?

1:01:15.884 --> 1:01:17.094
Instruments.

1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:20.097
Expendable.

1:01:21.306 --> 1:01:23.350
We deserve better.

1:01:35.153 --> 1:01:39.408
Tell me the passcode and walk away.

1:01:41.785 --> 1:01:42.870
If you don't…

1:01:44.037 --> 1:01:46.206
well, we both know how that will go.

1:01:46.874 --> 1:01:48.458
I will get what I want…

1:01:50.627 --> 1:01:52.504
and you will die anyway.

1:01:53.463 --> 1:01:54.965
For nothing.

1:01:58.677 --> 1:02:00.512
I swear to God,
I don't know what the passcode is.

1:02:00.596 --> 1:02:01.805
I'm not even the Taxman.

1:02:02.598 --> 1:02:03.473
Shut up.

1:02:06.185 --> 1:02:07.311
Can we get back to business?

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:09.771
Is that my money?

1:02:12.691 --> 1:02:15.611
Your payment will be wired soon.

1:02:15.694 --> 1:02:18.447
Rumor has it
you stole a weapon you can't use,

1:02:18.530 --> 1:02:20.157
so you're overextended.

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:23.410
And now you want me to work on what?
Credit?

1:02:23.493 --> 1:02:25.329
No, no.

1:02:25.412 --> 1:02:26.413
Cash.

1:02:27.289 --> 1:02:30.417
And until I get it,
he doesn't leave my sight.

1:02:30.501 --> 1:02:32.294
Or we just kill you.

1:02:35.339 --> 1:02:38.675
And make your boss
the guy who offers big paydays

1:02:38.759 --> 1:02:40.344
and kills anyone who delivers?

1:02:41.386 --> 1:02:42.888
Let me guess.

1:02:42.971 --> 1:02:45.766
This is the idiot
who lost him to begin with.

1:02:45.849 --> 1:02:48.101
You'll get your cash when you land.

1:02:52.064 --> 1:02:53.106
She called you an idiot.

1:02:53.690 --> 1:02:54.566
Yeah.

1:02:54.650 --> 1:02:55.943
To your face.

1:02:56.902 --> 1:02:59.571
Kill her when you touch down.

1:03:01.031 --> 1:03:02.866
Get that passcode.

1:03:03.742 --> 1:03:06.078
I expect that to be open
next time I see you.

1:03:06.161 --> 1:03:07.162
You're not coming?

1:03:09.790 --> 1:03:12.918
If anything should go wrong
when you open that case…

1:03:16.463 --> 1:03:18.549
…everyone on board dies.

1:03:18.632 --> 1:03:19.800
No pressure.

1:03:21.260 --> 1:03:22.261
Yes, sir.

1:03:37.359 --> 1:03:39.695
We're looking for a genetic sequence.

1:03:40.737 --> 1:03:42.197
Do you know what "genetic" means?

1:03:51.206 --> 1:03:52.416
That's a cactus.

1:03:55.502 --> 1:03:56.753
Thirsty?

1:04:08.223 --> 1:04:09.766
-Be smart.
-Sociopath.

1:04:09.850 --> 1:04:11.476
I'm not a sociopath.

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:13.812
You know who says that a lot? Sociopaths.

1:04:19.401 --> 1:04:23.405
I have dated some crazies in my day,
but you are certifiable.

1:04:23.488 --> 1:04:25.741
This is bigger than you and me.

1:04:26.533 --> 1:04:28.035
And my plan worked.

1:04:28.744 --> 1:04:29.745
Better than I imagined.

1:04:29.828 --> 1:04:30.829
Really?

1:04:31.371 --> 1:04:33.373
Did you imagine
I'd make it out of this alive?

1:04:33.457 --> 1:04:34.833
We found Aztec.

1:04:39.213 --> 1:04:41.757
As soon as we land,
we'll take these guys down.

1:04:42.549 --> 1:04:43.592
We'll be safe.

1:04:43.675 --> 1:04:45.886
The world will be safe. Everybody wins.

1:04:53.936 --> 1:04:55.312
What's all this?

1:04:55.395 --> 1:04:56.396
What's…

1:04:58.315 --> 1:04:59.316
all this?

1:05:06.532 --> 1:05:08.617
I would expect more discretion

1:05:10.118 --> 1:05:11.161
from the Taxman.

1:05:11.954 --> 1:05:13.205
So would I.

1:05:14.873 --> 1:05:16.375
So what are you really?

1:05:17.334 --> 1:05:18.710
Hired help?

1:05:19.878 --> 1:05:20.712
Or just the girlfriend?

1:05:20.796 --> 1:05:23.006
Believe me, she's not girlfriend material.

1:05:23.090 --> 1:05:24.132
You know, I don't care.

1:05:25.342 --> 1:05:26.969
You die either way.

1:05:28.053 --> 1:05:29.847
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait. Wait.

1:05:30.931 --> 1:05:32.641
Who's the idiot now?

1:05:32.724 --> 1:05:34.059
I have the passcode.

1:05:35.519 --> 1:05:37.145
Bullshit.

1:05:37.896 --> 1:05:38.897
He doesn't have it.

1:05:39.481 --> 1:05:40.482
I do.

1:05:41.650 --> 1:05:42.985
Really?

1:05:43.819 --> 1:05:44.903
So we can kill him.

1:05:46.822 --> 1:05:48.907
Hey! Wait. Okay. Wait.

1:05:48.991 --> 1:05:50.826
The passcode. Now!

1:05:52.327 --> 1:05:54.413
Sure. It's in my pocket.

1:05:58.041 --> 1:05:59.042
We're good.

1:06:05.716 --> 1:06:06.800
Really?

1:06:06.884 --> 1:06:07.885
Open it.

1:06:38.248 --> 1:06:39.333
Shit!

1:06:45.339 --> 1:06:48.008
I can't believe you took a picture of me
while I was sleeping!

1:06:48.091 --> 1:06:49.468
Not of you, of us!

1:06:49.551 --> 1:06:50.928
I knew you were a creep!

1:06:55.224 --> 1:06:56.225
I'm not a creep!

1:06:56.308 --> 1:06:58.393
You know who says that a lot? Creeps!

1:08:07.045 --> 1:08:08.797
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

1:08:09.965 --> 1:08:11.133
Oh, my God.

1:08:11.216 --> 1:08:12.801
Take the case and go.

1:08:14.595 --> 1:08:17.055
-There is a parachute.
-What about you?

1:08:17.139 --> 1:08:18.807
Mission over man.

1:08:18.890 --> 1:08:22.060
No. No. I gotta stop this bleeding first.
You're losing a lot of blood.

1:08:22.144 --> 1:08:23.187
-Just go, Cole.
-I gotta find…

1:08:23.270 --> 1:08:25.022
-Cole, go! Go!
-Sadie, I'm telling you right--

1:08:26.982 --> 1:08:28.024
Get out of here.

1:08:35.282 --> 1:08:36.200
Hey!

1:08:44.082 --> 1:08:45.959
Get out of the way, you idiot.

1:08:48.545 --> 1:08:49.462
What are you doing?

1:08:49.546 --> 1:08:50.631
I have no idea.

1:09:19.535 --> 1:09:20.661
Sadie?

1:09:22.162 --> 1:09:23.663
God.

1:09:28.502 --> 1:09:29.670
I told you to go.

1:09:32.631 --> 1:09:33.631
I did.

1:09:34.131 --> 1:09:35.509
I just took you with me.

1:09:36.093 --> 1:09:37.219
How long was I out?

1:09:37.301 --> 1:09:38.595
A while.

1:09:40.264 --> 1:09:42.558
Looks like you got creative
with the parachute.

1:09:44.434 --> 1:09:45.644
I had a lot of nervous energy.

1:09:53.234 --> 1:09:54.236
You got it.

1:09:54.903 --> 1:09:55.988
Yeah. Yeah.

1:09:56.488 --> 1:09:57.739
You got it.

1:09:57.823 --> 1:09:59.741
-You got Aztec.
-Yeah.

1:10:01.451 --> 1:10:03.120
-Wait. Take it easy.
-I mean, do you have a--

1:10:03.203 --> 1:10:04.663
You lost a lot of blood.

1:10:07.165 --> 1:10:08.166
It was really gross.

1:10:10.252 --> 1:10:12.045
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

1:10:13.755 --> 1:10:14.756
Thank you.

1:10:15.507 --> 1:10:16.508
You're welcome.

1:10:37.070 --> 1:10:39.531
Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon.

1:10:41.116 --> 1:10:42.201
Hello?

1:10:42.284 --> 1:10:44.077
Leveque, things didn't go as planned.

1:10:44.995 --> 1:10:46.496
The girl sprung the Taxman.

1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:48.999
How many times can you lose one man?

1:10:49.875 --> 1:10:51.210
Listen carefully.

1:10:51.293 --> 1:10:54.379
If we do not deliver
an operational weapon in 48 hours,

1:10:54.463 --> 1:10:55.881
our buyers will kill us all.

1:10:56.673 --> 1:10:58.300
Now, you find the Taxman,

1:10:59.384 --> 1:11:03.347
or they will not have the chance
because I will kill you myself.

1:11:07.059 --> 1:11:09.353
Boss. We have a sighting of the parachute.

1:11:11.188 --> 1:11:12.356
Good.

1:11:22.533 --> 1:11:25.327
You know,
I think, depending on your strength,

1:11:26.161 --> 1:11:28.372
we should consider maybe hiking
out of here tomorrow.

1:11:28.956 --> 1:11:30.207
Depending on your strength.

1:11:33.919 --> 1:11:36.547
You have to tell me. What is this gunk?

1:11:37.339 --> 1:11:39.675
It's periwinkle and gavilana.

1:11:39.758 --> 1:11:42.261
I found it up the beach,
smashed it up and put it in there

1:11:42.344 --> 1:11:44.763
to stop the bleeding
and fight the infection.

1:11:45.430 --> 1:11:48.058
-How did you know how to do that?
-I read about it.

1:11:49.059 --> 1:11:52.729
Throughout history, every culture has
their own knowledge of the crops they grow

1:11:53.272 --> 1:11:55.732
for food or clothing, medicine.

1:11:57.401 --> 1:12:00.529
I just don't get why you never left
the country.

1:12:01.613 --> 1:12:03.031
-Here we go.
-What? I'm serious.

1:12:03.115 --> 1:12:05.117
You're clearly interested in the world.

1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:10.205
I wanted to travel. I really did.
I thought I was gonna after I graduated.

1:12:10.289 --> 1:12:12.624
You know, research the book.
Then my dad got hurt…

1:12:15.752 --> 1:12:16.753
just went home.

1:12:18.589 --> 1:12:19.882
He never recovered?

1:12:20.674 --> 1:12:22.342
No, he did. He's good now.

1:12:22.426 --> 1:12:24.720
But you know, he's getting old.

1:12:24.803 --> 1:12:27.848
And you know,
we got to keep production high to compete,

1:12:27.931 --> 1:12:29.766
and business is changing.

1:12:29.850 --> 1:12:30.851
Anyway…

1:12:32.519 --> 1:12:33.562
They need me there.

1:12:34.646 --> 1:12:35.647
Do they?

1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:42.654
What about you? Your mom must be proud.

1:12:42.738 --> 1:12:45.490
Daughter's a CIA agent. Right?

1:12:47.951 --> 1:12:49.328
I'd like to think she'd be.

1:12:52.664 --> 1:12:54.583
My mom died when I was very young.

1:12:55.459 --> 1:12:58.170
-God, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
-It's okay.

1:12:58.253 --> 1:13:01.298
I promise. It happened so long ago.

1:13:02.216 --> 1:13:06.011
You know, and then after she died,
I found the army.

1:13:06.512 --> 1:13:10.390
You know,
somewhere where I could put my focus.

1:13:10.974 --> 1:13:14.645
And then the agency, they gave me purpose.

1:13:17.481 --> 1:13:21.276
Our struggles make us stronger. Right?

1:13:23.403 --> 1:13:24.571
Any other family?

1:13:26.532 --> 1:13:29.409
In my line of work,
it's better being alone.

1:13:30.786 --> 1:13:31.787
Is it?

1:13:37.543 --> 1:13:40.754
For what it's worth, I think
that any parent would be very proud…

1:13:42.172 --> 1:13:43.340
of you.

1:13:47.427 --> 1:13:48.554
You know what?

1:13:48.637 --> 1:13:52.599
I just can't believe that that little shit
is still in one piece.

1:13:53.433 --> 1:13:55.727
Maybe you can keep
a cactus alive after all.

1:13:56.979 --> 1:13:57.980
Maybe.

1:14:09.324 --> 1:14:10.742
I'm sorry about the selfie.

1:14:11.451 --> 1:14:13.078
I'm sorry about the gag.

1:14:13.161 --> 1:14:14.538
Call it even?

1:14:14.621 --> 1:14:15.622
Deal.

1:14:59.666 --> 1:15:00.709
Run!

1:15:03.170 --> 1:15:06.840
Get me the Taxman alive, kill the girl,
and I'll get Aztec.

1:15:18.602 --> 1:15:19.728
Move! Move!

1:15:21.688 --> 1:15:22.814
There she is.

1:15:32.157 --> 1:15:34.743
Attention.
This is the United States Marines.

1:15:34.826 --> 1:15:38.205
Safety your weapons
and drop them on the ground.

1:15:54.304 --> 1:15:55.639
Damn it.

1:16:23.876 --> 1:16:25.127
Where's the case?

1:16:30.716 --> 1:16:33.927
Agent Rhodes. It's time to go home.

1:16:35.679 --> 1:16:37.598
We're fine. Thanks.

1:16:39.183 --> 1:16:40.309
Let's go.

1:16:48.775 --> 1:16:51.445
-That's not too tight on you now, is it?
-No.

1:16:51.528 --> 1:16:53.280
Okay. Just wanna make sure.

1:16:53.363 --> 1:16:54.406
Yeah, that's good.

1:16:56.617 --> 1:16:58.452
A polygraph, Jackson?

1:16:58.535 --> 1:17:01.246
Are you really
this desperate to jump ahead of me?

1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:04.875
I'm just doing my job, Rhodes.

1:17:04.958 --> 1:17:08.337
No, if you were doing your job,
you'd be out there looking for Aztec.

1:17:08.420 --> 1:17:10.380
If you had done yours,
we never would have lost it.

1:17:10.464 --> 1:17:13.467
Well, it wasn't her fault.
She was just trying to save me.

1:17:16.261 --> 1:17:17.387
Of course.

1:17:18.347 --> 1:17:20.891
The boyfriend,
accidentally along for the ride.

1:17:20.974 --> 1:17:23.435
Didn't it ever occur to you
that he could be a foreign asset,

1:17:23.519 --> 1:17:24.770
trying to compromise your mission?

1:17:25.687 --> 1:17:31.109
Yeah. Six-foot honeypot sent to kiss
and nibble the secrets right out of you.

1:17:31.193 --> 1:17:33.612
Patti, just watch the machine, please.

1:17:33.695 --> 1:17:35.447
Right. Sorry.

1:17:35.531 --> 1:17:40.160
We both know you checked him out.
He's a civilian, and he's clean.

1:17:41.328 --> 1:17:42.746
Some civilian.

1:17:42.829 --> 1:17:47.584
Because you chose his life over thousands,
if Aztec is ever deployed.

1:17:47.668 --> 1:17:50.045
I let my emotions cloud my judgment.

1:17:52.172 --> 1:17:53.173
Wait a minute.

1:17:55.843 --> 1:18:00.055
Are you saying you think
it was a mistake to save my life?

1:18:02.808 --> 1:18:03.725
Yes.

1:18:10.732 --> 1:18:11.733
That's great.

1:18:12.901 --> 1:18:14.236
That's great.

1:18:14.820 --> 1:18:18.782
Cole, I'm sorry, but they're right.
One life compared to thousands.

1:18:18.866 --> 1:18:21.535
Yeah, no, I get it.
Mission over man justifies everything.

1:18:21.618 --> 1:18:23.954
Marco's hand,
using me as bait at the airstrip.

1:18:24.037 --> 1:18:25.581
-I get it.
-You used him as bait?

1:18:25.664 --> 1:18:26.498
-Yes.
-No.

1:18:26.582 --> 1:18:27.958
Well…

1:18:28.041 --> 1:18:30.711
Marco was right about you.
You should date someone just like him.

1:18:30.794 --> 1:18:33.255
Completely cut off
from emotional connection

1:18:33.338 --> 1:18:34.756
-and not afraid to lose a limb.
-What?

1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:37.759
You know what?
Marco was right, but not about that.

1:18:38.510 --> 1:18:42.306
We only have one life,
and you are too afraid to live it.

1:18:42.389 --> 1:18:43.599
Says the one-handed dead guy.

1:18:43.682 --> 1:18:44.725
What's happening?

1:18:44.808 --> 1:18:46.894
Cole, you went to your parents' house
to help them.

1:18:46.977 --> 1:18:48.896
But I don't think they need you anymore.

1:18:48.979 --> 1:18:50.981
I think
they're just an excuse to avoid life.

1:18:51.064 --> 1:18:52.191
Look who's talking.

1:18:52.274 --> 1:18:56.862
Your job, the duty, the sacrifice,
that's your excuse to keep people out.

1:18:56.945 --> 1:18:58.572
I think you're afraid
to get close to people.

1:18:58.655 --> 1:18:59.948
'Cause if you do, you might lose them.

1:19:00.032 --> 1:19:01.325
-Just like you lost your mother.
-Hey!

1:19:02.367 --> 1:19:04.828
You don't talk about her!

1:19:08.999 --> 1:19:10.751
And I'm not afraid of anything.

1:19:13.212 --> 1:19:15.130
You two need to get a room.

1:19:16.215 --> 1:19:17.382
-Oh, my God.
-Patti,

1:19:17.466 --> 1:19:18.800
he's not even hooked up to the machine.

1:19:18.884 --> 1:19:22.638
I'm sorry. But, you guys,
the sexual tension in the room is just--

1:19:22.721 --> 1:19:23.972
The boss wants to see you.

1:19:31.813 --> 1:19:33.774
So much for starting with a houseplant.

1:19:37.027 --> 1:19:38.820
I know she pulled you into this…

1:19:41.198 --> 1:19:42.074
but…

1:19:44.952 --> 1:19:46.203
you're still in deep shit.

1:19:46.995 --> 1:19:48.413
You're facing prosecution.

1:19:48.497 --> 1:19:50.999
For what? Visiting a girl in London?

1:19:51.083 --> 1:19:52.334
Why are you protecting her?

1:19:52.417 --> 1:19:55.963
I know this looks bad. I can fix it.

1:19:56.046 --> 1:19:57.422
We can still get Leveque.

1:19:57.506 --> 1:20:00.300
You were always my favorite, Sadie.

1:20:00.384 --> 1:20:03.387
But you going rogue,
there's nothing I can do.

1:20:03.971 --> 1:20:04.888
What do you mean?

1:20:04.972 --> 1:20:07.391
She didn't lose Aztec, did she?

1:20:07.474 --> 1:20:09.810
No, no, no, no, no.
She's working an angle.

1:20:09.893 --> 1:20:11.603
-No. No.
-Looking to cash in.

1:20:13.605 --> 1:20:14.940
Sadie would never do that.

1:20:17.317 --> 1:20:20.445
You let Aztec
get into the hands of a known threat.

1:20:20.529 --> 1:20:22.781
You're suspended,
pending a full investigation,

1:20:22.865 --> 1:20:24.700
but you know how these things go.

1:20:24.783 --> 1:20:27.911
You'll be lucky to have a job
at all when it's done.

1:20:30.664 --> 1:20:32.416
Look at what she does.

1:20:32.499 --> 1:20:34.251
And this is just the last six months.

1:20:34.334 --> 1:20:36.587
She's a liar and a killer, Cole.

1:20:37.421 --> 1:20:38.922
Is that someone you want to protect?

1:20:41.508 --> 1:20:42.801
Take home to Mom?

1:20:48.724 --> 1:20:49.975
Oh, my God.

1:20:53.645 --> 1:20:56.648
What am I looking at? A houseplant?

1:20:56.732 --> 1:20:59.860
Well, it's not a houseplant.
That's an amaranth. A crop.

1:21:01.904 --> 1:21:05.073
Farmed in the Americas
for thousands of years, mostly for food,

1:21:05.157 --> 1:21:08.452
but often used in rituals by the Aztecs.

1:21:09.620 --> 1:21:14.541
Oh, my God. The plant wasn't hers.
She took it from Horvath, the scientist.

1:21:14.625 --> 1:21:17.628
He was obsessed with the Aztecs' use
of human sacrifice.

1:21:18.545 --> 1:21:21.548
The genetic sequence
of that amaranth is the passcode.

1:21:21.632 --> 1:21:23.091
I'll be damned.

1:21:23.175 --> 1:21:26.261
I want that plant retrieved
from Elena's apartment now.

1:21:27.095 --> 1:21:30.766
You know, we can use this to lure
in Leveque. We get a message to him.

1:21:30.849 --> 1:21:33.727
"The Taxman is ready
to sell the passcode."

1:21:33.810 --> 1:21:34.853
He'll never go for it.

1:21:34.937 --> 1:21:36.897
Unless we bait the hook.

1:21:38.065 --> 1:21:40.651
The passcode is divided
into four segments.

1:21:40.734 --> 1:21:42.069
Send Leveque the first.

1:21:42.152 --> 1:21:45.572
What? Give him part of the key?
That's insane.

1:21:45.656 --> 1:21:48.659
Exactly. The agency would never allow it.

1:21:49.326 --> 1:21:53.830
So if the Taxman is doing it, that means
he went rogue and the offer is real.

1:21:55.457 --> 1:21:57.459
Leveque is desperate. He'll bite.

1:22:00.170 --> 1:22:03.674
That means we're gonna need the Taxman.

1:22:07.177 --> 1:22:11.265
Me? No, no, no way.

1:22:11.348 --> 1:22:13.600
It's only for appearances.
He won't even get near you.

1:22:13.684 --> 1:22:17.312
Well, then what do you need me for?
Use a dummy. Put Jackson in a disguise.

1:22:17.396 --> 1:22:18.564
That's a great idea.

1:22:18.647 --> 1:22:22.526
Mr. Turner, I know you don't want
to do this, but I also know that you will.

1:22:22.609 --> 1:22:25.946
As long as Leveque thinks
you're the Taxman, you're in danger.

1:22:26.029 --> 1:22:29.783
Well, then put me in protective custody.
Hide me just until you find the guy.

1:22:29.867 --> 1:22:31.201
What about your family?

1:22:32.995 --> 1:22:36.373
-What about my family?
-Guys like Leveque, they never stop.

1:22:36.957 --> 1:22:39.501
The only way
to guarantee your family's safety

1:22:39.585 --> 1:22:41.128
is to take him off the board.

1:22:44.590 --> 1:22:45.632
No, no, no.

1:22:46.216 --> 1:22:50.554
Hey, Cole. Cole, it's too dangerous.

1:22:51.847 --> 1:22:53.015
They're using you.

1:22:53.682 --> 1:22:56.560
Well, that's funny because he just said
the same thing about you.

1:22:56.643 --> 1:22:59.521
Remind me, which one of you
can't stop risking my life?

1:22:59.605 --> 1:23:02.858
I know you're angry,
but this is a mistake.

1:23:04.109 --> 1:23:06.486
Protecting the people you love
is never a mistake.

1:23:08.113 --> 1:23:10.991
Maybe one day you'll care enough
about someone to understand that.

1:23:13.702 --> 1:23:14.828
Rhodes.

1:23:23.212 --> 1:23:25.172
Come on, you have to let me run this.

1:23:25.756 --> 1:23:27.841
I know more about Leveque's operation
than anyone.

1:23:27.925 --> 1:23:30.677
Go home, Sadie. And stay there.

1:23:49.154 --> 1:23:50.155
What do you think?

1:23:50.239 --> 1:23:52.491
What do I think? I think it is a trap.

1:23:54.368 --> 1:23:55.369
Test it.

1:24:10.634 --> 1:24:11.635
It's genuine.

1:24:13.345 --> 1:24:14.471
Maybe it's not a trap.

1:24:14.555 --> 1:24:19.393
Or maybe it is just a very good one.
Either way, what choice do we have?

1:24:20.185 --> 1:24:21.186
Boss.

1:24:25.566 --> 1:24:28.986
Mr. Utami. Pleasure to see you again.

1:24:29.069 --> 1:24:31.405
Funny. When you accepted my first payment,

1:24:31.488 --> 1:24:33.949
you neglected to mention
that you didn't have the passcode.

1:24:34.032 --> 1:24:38.078
We will have it soon.
Aztec will be yours as promised.

1:24:47.129 --> 1:24:48.255
Mine, I believe.

1:24:50.215 --> 1:24:51.508
You're meeting the Taxman?

1:24:52.968 --> 1:24:54.094
We'll go together.

1:24:55.804 --> 1:25:01.602
If he has the passcode, we conclude
our business. If he doesn't, I kill you.

1:25:10.110 --> 1:25:12.821
Mr. Utami, one condition.

1:25:13.822 --> 1:25:16.450
Whatever happens, the Taxman dies.

1:25:17.451 --> 1:25:18.535
So be it.

1:25:58.659 --> 1:26:00.702
Turner,
get in there and make it look good.

1:26:00.786 --> 1:26:02.788
You'll be in and out in 20 minutes.

1:26:07.751 --> 1:26:10.921
Stop messing with your collar. Sounds
like a goddamn thunderstorm in here.

1:26:11.004 --> 1:26:13.799
Sorry, I hate suits.

1:26:28.647 --> 1:26:31.650
-How many guys do you have?
-Including me? Three.

1:26:32.901 --> 1:26:36.071
Three? What do you mean? Three guys total?

1:26:36.154 --> 1:26:38.282
You have three guys total?
You can't do this with three guys.

1:26:38.365 --> 1:26:41.827
The CIA can't operate on US soil.
We had to travel light.

1:26:41.910 --> 1:26:46.039
Travel light?
What are you, backpacking through Europe?

1:26:46.123 --> 1:26:49.334
You're the CIA. What does that even mean?
Travel light?

1:26:49.418 --> 1:26:52.629
Calm down. Leveque's men
just need to see you in there.

1:26:52.713 --> 1:26:54.381
We'll arrest him as soon as he shows.

1:26:54.464 --> 1:26:55.799
You got to play the part.

1:26:55.883 --> 1:27:00.387
You're not a farmer anymore. Remember?
You're the Taxman. Now, get in there.

1:27:12.941 --> 1:27:14.276
Hi, welcome in.

1:27:14.359 --> 1:27:15.861
Table for Mr. Taxman.

1:27:15.944 --> 1:27:17.237
Yes, right this way.

1:27:34.505 --> 1:27:35.756
Cheers!

1:27:52.397 --> 1:27:55.067
Everything will be fine.
We've got it all under control,

1:27:55.150 --> 1:27:56.985
and the bad guys will never get near you.

1:27:57.069 --> 1:27:58.695
Three guys.

1:28:16.672 --> 1:28:17.965
They're here.

1:28:28.642 --> 1:28:31.520
We got eyes on the target.
He has the weapon.

1:28:32.688 --> 1:28:33.939
Let's get ready to move.

1:28:40.904 --> 1:28:42.531
Jackson. What was that?

1:28:43.866 --> 1:28:45.868
-Cole.
-What?

1:28:45.951 --> 1:28:47.077
Get out of there.

1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:50.914
Go now? Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:28:50.998 --> 1:28:52.749
Does this mean we lose Leveque?

1:28:53.458 --> 1:28:55.335
Jackson, what happens to my family
if you lose Leveque?

1:29:04.845 --> 1:29:05.846
I'm staying.

1:29:17.649 --> 1:29:18.775
She's coming.

1:29:20.277 --> 1:29:21.278
I know it.

1:29:43.467 --> 1:29:49.515
Well, well, well, what a romantic spot
for our first official date.

1:30:05.197 --> 1:30:09.159
I brought a little something special
for us to open up.

1:30:12.287 --> 1:30:16.166
And some chaperone. Hope you don't mind.

1:30:18.001 --> 1:30:22.339
I apologize. Yours are no longer with us.

1:30:23.340 --> 1:30:25.175
It is more intimate this way, no?

1:30:26.593 --> 1:30:28.220
Are you all right, Taxman?

1:30:30.138 --> 1:30:32.891
I hate to think something
might ruin our night.

1:30:37.855 --> 1:30:40.732
-Thank you.
-For what?

1:30:40.816 --> 1:30:43.110
For helping me with my chaperones.

1:30:43.944 --> 1:30:46.947
Saves me the hassle
of having to kill them myself.

1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:50.033
It was my pleasure.

1:30:52.494 --> 1:30:54.413
But somehow I don't believe you.

1:30:55.497 --> 1:30:57.291
Well, I don't care what you believe.

1:30:58.292 --> 1:31:02.546
My intention is to walk out of here
a very rich man and disappear.

1:31:02.629 --> 1:31:06.800
The great Taxman betraying his country.

1:31:08.343 --> 1:31:11.680
No. Why would you do that?

1:31:13.640 --> 1:31:17.686
What you said to me
about wasting my life. Made me think.

1:31:20.772 --> 1:31:22.774
Let's not delay this new beginning.

1:31:24.568 --> 1:31:25.652
The passcode.

1:31:31.867 --> 1:31:32.701
Money first.

1:31:34.453 --> 1:31:38.207
And… my price doubled.

1:31:38.290 --> 1:31:40.501
Negotiations are over.

1:31:43.128 --> 1:31:47.966
Well, negotiations are never over anytime.

1:31:48.050 --> 1:31:48.967
You know, it…

1:31:49.801 --> 1:31:51.720
actually reminds me of this one time
I was…

1:31:53.639 --> 1:31:56.266
I was selling missiles to a arms dealer,

1:31:56.350 --> 1:31:59.353
and he was haggling and haggling,
wouldn't stop.

1:31:59.436 --> 1:32:01.855
Finally, he bought the missiles and…

1:32:03.774 --> 1:32:05.734
And he comes back an hour later,
and he says,

1:32:05.817 --> 1:32:08.320
"I paid too much for these missiles.
I want a better price," you know.

1:32:08.403 --> 1:32:10.906
And I said, "That's not how this works.
You can't haggle now."

1:32:10.989 --> 1:32:14.201
He says, "I want a full refund.
I don't even want the missiles anymore."

1:32:14.284 --> 1:32:17.037
I said to him, "Look,
I can't take these missiles back.

1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:19.206
-You've had them for an hour."
-Enough!

1:32:20.374 --> 1:32:22.459
The passcode now!

1:32:23.210 --> 1:32:24.753
Or you both die.

1:32:27.005 --> 1:32:28.423
He gets very upset.

1:32:29.883 --> 1:32:31.260
Do you have the passcode?

1:32:33.387 --> 1:32:35.097
Do you have the passcode or not?

1:32:35.597 --> 1:32:39.059
'Cause it is going to be very painful
for both of us if you do not.

1:32:40.060 --> 1:32:41.270
My friend?

1:33:11.049 --> 1:33:12.384
I'm sorry I'm late.

1:33:18.807 --> 1:33:19.933
Glad you could make it.

1:33:20.517 --> 1:33:24.021
Well, what can I say?
You might be growing on me.

1:33:25.647 --> 1:33:26.815
What is this?

1:33:27.399 --> 1:33:30.235
An opportunity for me to check out
all the players.

1:33:30.319 --> 1:33:33.322
Mr. Utami, since you're the one
with the money, I'll address you.

1:33:33.822 --> 1:33:36.909
The price of the passcode
is exactly half of Leveque's fee.

1:33:38.327 --> 1:33:43.290
Wire it to this account
after that case opens.

1:33:43.790 --> 1:33:45.626
You are the Taxman.

1:33:46.210 --> 1:33:47.544
Here to collect.

1:33:53.091 --> 1:33:55.761
In that case, then who are you?

1:33:55.844 --> 1:33:56.887
My boyfriend.

1:33:58.972 --> 1:34:00.057
Damn straight.

1:34:00.974 --> 1:34:03.310
If you have the passcode,
I accept your terms.

1:34:03.393 --> 1:34:05.312
-Mr. Utami--
-Open it.

1:34:08.190 --> 1:34:09.775
You have the passcode?

1:34:09.858 --> 1:34:11.693
I still have friends at the agency.

1:34:13.278 --> 1:34:14.446
Wait a minute. You can't open that.

1:34:14.530 --> 1:34:17.783
When the people you love are in danger,
you do whatever it takes.

1:34:47.396 --> 1:34:48.272
Voilà.

1:34:49.481 --> 1:34:51.900
Aztec, as promised.

1:34:54.820 --> 1:34:56.029
Thank you very much.

1:35:04.872 --> 1:35:06.748
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

1:35:06.832 --> 1:35:08.375
Yes, thank you very much.

1:35:09.001 --> 1:35:13.839
However, my business is not yet finished,
but you are.

1:35:13.922 --> 1:35:17.801
What makes you think I will let you two
out of here alive?

1:35:18.385 --> 1:35:22.139
The ten-million-dollar bounty
I put on your head might help.

1:35:24.349 --> 1:35:27.728
I don't know
how many bounty hunters are here,

1:35:27.811 --> 1:35:29.855
but they definitely know about you.

1:35:32.649 --> 1:35:34.151
Know what's funny?

1:35:34.651 --> 1:35:38.906
Like you, I didn't actually have
the money until just now,

1:35:38.989 --> 1:35:41.116
but the bounty hunters
didn't need to know that.

1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:42.618
They just needed to know where you were.

1:35:42.701 --> 1:35:45.120
Okay, Leveque.
You're worth a lot of money.

1:35:45.204 --> 1:35:48.081
-I'll take that from you.
-Gun!

1:35:48.624 --> 1:35:51.877
Nobody move!

1:35:53.879 --> 1:35:56.131
You are so dead, my friend.

1:35:56.215 --> 1:35:59.134
Tell your guys not to do anything stupid.

1:36:23.242 --> 1:36:26.036
And what is the plan, huh?
Now what are you going to do?

1:36:26.912 --> 1:36:28.789
Do nothing. You're coming with me.

1:36:28.872 --> 1:36:30.791
How can I do nothing and come with you?

1:36:30.874 --> 1:36:33.418
You idiot,
how are you going to get out of here?

1:36:33.502 --> 1:36:38.173
I'll give you 20 million to shoot
this one. To kill her right now.

1:36:50.644 --> 1:36:51.812
Are you ready?

1:36:51.895 --> 1:36:54.147
Ready for what?
No, I'm not. I'm definitely not. What--

1:37:31.143 --> 1:37:34.980
You flush them forward.
I will cut around. Get the vial. Now! Go!

1:37:37.983 --> 1:37:38.984
Stairs.

1:38:04.635 --> 1:38:05.844
Where you going?

1:38:22.653 --> 1:38:23.946
Sadie?

1:38:24.029 --> 1:38:25.322
I'm an ally.

1:38:26.031 --> 1:38:28.408
-Jonas?
-I have missed you so much.

1:38:29.368 --> 1:38:31.495
Listen, it was never gonna
work out between us.

1:38:31.578 --> 1:38:33.914
No, no, no, no. Of course it wasn't.
I was losing too many body parts.

1:38:33.997 --> 1:38:35.958
That's not sustainable.
But if you look on the bright side,

1:38:36.041 --> 1:38:37.292
I still have 20 vision.

1:38:40.212 --> 1:38:41.922
Jonas,
I'm in the middle of something here.

1:38:42.005 --> 1:38:44.925
I know. Look, losing the eye sucked.

1:38:45.008 --> 1:38:47.010
But I'll tell you,
getting this thing blown off,

1:38:47.094 --> 1:38:48.846
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1:38:48.929 --> 1:38:53.100
Seriously, it changed my whole life.
I'm a good, solid, active listener now.

1:38:54.518 --> 1:38:55.811
That's the other ear.

1:38:55.894 --> 1:38:58.522
I didn't need the ear.
You keep going. You do what you do.

1:39:05.487 --> 1:39:06.780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:39:09.157 --> 1:39:11.618
All right, yes.
That looked cool, but cheating.

1:39:11.702 --> 1:39:15.122
You're not the Taxman.
Who the hell are you?

1:39:15.205 --> 1:39:16.206
What she said.

1:39:17.499 --> 1:39:18.959
I'm the boyfriend.

1:39:39.605 --> 1:39:41.064
No!

1:39:51.867 --> 1:39:53.160
You need to get me out.

1:39:53.243 --> 1:39:54.703
No, you stay here.

1:40:20.979 --> 1:40:22.231
Give me the weapon.

1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:36.119
Damn it.

1:40:36.203 --> 1:40:38.956
Come on, Taxman. Give me my weapon.

1:41:12.656 --> 1:41:14.575
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1:41:16.159 --> 1:41:18.161
Squandering all this talent.

1:41:18.996 --> 1:41:22.374
-You and I could've had so much working--
-There's nothing you have that I want.

1:41:42.477 --> 1:41:46.523
What is it that you want, huh?
You want a boyfriend? So pedestrian.

1:41:47.691 --> 1:41:50.652
He does not know you.
He does not see the real you.

1:42:02.164 --> 1:42:03.582
Cole?

1:42:07.503 --> 1:42:08.545
Cole!

1:42:42.871 --> 1:42:44.331
Get me over there!

1:43:07.479 --> 1:43:09.273
You look amazing in that dress.

1:43:10.607 --> 1:43:12.609
And you should wear more suits.

1:43:36.383 --> 1:43:40.554
-He almost died in a refrigerator.
-But I did not do that. That was his.

1:43:40.637 --> 1:43:42.973
-In a refrigerator, for how long?
-Was it you?

1:43:43.056 --> 1:43:45.350
-Why would I put a cat in a fridge?
-What are you talking about?

1:43:45.434 --> 1:43:47.186
-You didn't put him in.
-I think it's pretty clear.

1:43:47.269 --> 1:43:50.189
-You didn't notice him when you closed it.
-Not the cat story.

1:43:50.272 --> 1:43:53.275
-He did it.
-Yeah, the cat story again.

1:43:53.358 --> 1:43:56.862
So, Europe by rail.
That sounds so romantic.

1:43:56.945 --> 1:43:58.739
You want to write a book,
you got to do research.

1:43:58.822 --> 1:44:00.407
What's Sadie supposed to do
in all these places

1:44:00.490 --> 1:44:02.284
while you're reading musty old scrolls
about farming?

1:44:02.367 --> 1:44:06.163
Don't worry about me. I have a whole list
of clients I need to hunt down.

1:44:06.747 --> 1:44:08.290
I'm sure you're gonna get them all, dear.

1:44:08.373 --> 1:44:09.249
I know I will.

1:44:09.333 --> 1:44:10.417
Yeah, she will.

1:44:10.501 --> 1:44:12.586
Art curating is so much more exciting
than I imagined.

1:44:12.669 --> 1:44:14.963
-Yeah
-Yeah. God, like, I want to be you.

1:44:15.047 --> 1:44:17.424
I mean, except the part where
you're sleeping with my brother.

1:44:17.508 --> 1:44:18.550
What?

1:44:18.634 --> 1:44:20.177
Just, please.

1:44:20.260 --> 1:44:21.512
-So…
-We're at the dinner table.

1:44:21.595 --> 1:44:23.764
You guys promise to take care
of this little guy while we're gone?

1:44:23.847 --> 1:44:25.307
Yes, I love succulents.

1:44:25.390 --> 1:44:28.685
-How hard is it to keep a cactus alive?
-Sometimes harder than you think.

1:44:28.769 --> 1:44:31.688
-But worth it.
-Very much.

1:44:33.273 --> 1:44:35.234
I mean, we're talking about a cactus.
Right?

1:44:35.317 --> 1:44:36.610
You water it once a month.

1:44:36.693 --> 1:44:38.820
-Or are we talking-- Okay. It's subtext.
-Okay.

1:44:38.904 --> 1:44:40.447
-That's right.
-There's a--

1:44:40.531 --> 1:44:42.282
-There's a hidden meaning.
-Yep. There's-- And then--

1:44:42.366 --> 1:44:43.742
-Levels.
-Okay, that's great.

1:44:43.825 --> 1:44:46.495
-Your mother and I have a--
-There's no "mother and I" story.

1:44:46.578 --> 1:44:48.872
-It's not about a cactus.
-No, it is not.

1:44:48.956 --> 1:44:50.165
It involves wrestling.

1:44:51.416 --> 1:44:54.962
Did he ever tell you that he wrestled
in high school?

1:44:55.045 --> 1:44:56.713
Keep drinking your wine.

1:44:56.797 --> 1:44:58.173
Okay.

1:45:11.395 --> 1:45:15.649
-Hey, babe, I'm sorry I'm late.
-Nice car.

1:45:16.608 --> 1:45:19.736
Are you sure the CIA didn't let you
keep Utami's money after all?

1:45:19.820 --> 1:45:22.322
You wish. I'm borrowing this.

1:45:22.406 --> 1:45:24.449
How was your meeting
with Professor Kirkland?

1:45:24.533 --> 1:45:25.868
-Really good.
-Yeah?

1:45:25.951 --> 1:45:27.661
He gave me some amazing research.

1:45:29.329 --> 1:45:30.455
This is Raul.

1:45:30.539 --> 1:45:31.957
He's an arms dealer,

1:45:32.833 --> 1:45:34.668
but business stays in the car.

1:45:37.713 --> 1:45:38.589
Date night.

1:45:43.385 --> 1:45:44.261
Us time.

1:45:46.972 --> 1:45:47.973
Us time.
