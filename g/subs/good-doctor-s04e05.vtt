WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.169
It's just a migraine.

00:03.253 --> 00:05.296
Honey, until we're completely sure…

00:06.631 --> 00:08.174
Is the pain a tight band or pulsating?

00:08.258 --> 00:09.467
Good question.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.679
Pulsating, light bothers me, nausea.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.431
I get these all the time.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.849
You said you didn't feel a, uh…

00:15.932 --> 00:16.933
What'd you call it? A…

00:17.017 --> 00:18.351
An aura. I know, but…

00:18.435 --> 00:21.104
Exactly how often
do you get these symptoms?

00:21.187 --> 00:24.357
I just ask, since your boyfriend
doesn't seem to recognize them.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.319
[chuckles lightly]

00:28.403 --> 00:29.988
[both chuckle]

00:30.071 --> 00:32.991
Zane and I have only known each other
for eight days.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.409
It moved fast.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.000
Ellie, did you feel your foot twitch?

00:42.792 --> 00:43.793
No.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.345
Positive Babinski.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.097
What does that mean?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.390
It's not a migraine.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.312
[theme music playing]

01:24.793 --> 01:25.794
[Dr. Reznick] Oh, that.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.922
I was performing due diligence
on my new roommate,

01:29.005 --> 01:30.381
who might be a violent maniac,

01:30.465 --> 01:32.342
and look what I found in his closet.

01:32.967 --> 01:33.843
It's cute.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.303
You moved in with two suitcases.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.013
You only have four pairs of underwear.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.890
How the hell did a parrot
make the cut?

01:38.973 --> 01:39.933
I'm a Parrothead.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.101
A Jimmy Buffett enthusiast.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.353
The <i>Margaritaville</i> guy?

01:43.436 --> 01:44.979
Well, he has other, far better songs,

01:45.063 --> 01:46.439
but yes, the <i>Margaritaville </i>guy.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.649
It brings me luck.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.443
Scary to think what your life
would be like without it.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.528
Can I have it back?

01:53.530 --> 01:55.406
It's fun getting to know you better.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.200
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.543
[groans, winces]

02:06.626 --> 02:09.921
I was demonstrating a torch lift
this morning, and, bang.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.173
"Ballet master."

02:12.257 --> 02:13.716
You're a dancer?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.927
God, no. I'm like the CEO.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.763
At my age,
I'd be the Betty White of the troupe.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.848
Is she a dancer?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.810
I don't know much about, uh, culture.

02:23.893 --> 02:24.894
[chuckles lightly]

02:25.895 --> 02:28.356
I assume I just sprained something, right?

02:28.439 --> 02:31.151
Uh, we will need neuro
and abdominal exams,

02:31.234 --> 02:32.318
X-rays for fractures,

02:32.402 --> 02:33.653
CBC for infection,

02:33.736 --> 02:35.572
cultures to rule out
a spinal abscess…

02:35.655 --> 02:38.283
You're new, aren't you?

02:40.535 --> 02:42.412
Uh, it's my second week here.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.959
It's actually only my first day
seeing patients.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.043
Am I your first?

02:49.544 --> 02:50.545
Yes.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.881
Sorry. But, yes.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.340
Well…

02:55.758 --> 02:56.843
That's impressive.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.513
Whoever's supervising you
must really trust you.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.643
I'm not sure that's true.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.315
They won't let me join their stupid gym

03:10.398 --> 03:11.983
because I had high blood pressure.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.235
How am I supposed
to lower it if I can't work out?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.778
200 over 105.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.071
That is quite high.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.823
I just told you it was high.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.452
Are you a smoker?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.579
Yeah. Pack or two a day.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.914
More if I feel crappy.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.498
And…

03:29.292 --> 03:30.293
Do you have diabetes?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.795
You're reading those questions
out of a book?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.881
-Yes.
-Have you ever done this before?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.346
I told you. You have to trust them.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.388
I don't.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.349
Then act like you do.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.019
Go away.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.112
[Jordan] Nothing more romantic than
spending one of your first dates in an ER.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.990
Well, stressful experiences
release oxytocin.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.201
Same hormone that creates emotional bonds.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.411
This might actually
cement their relationship.

04:06.955 --> 04:07.956
[computer beeps]

04:08.039 --> 04:09.332
Next to the hippocampus.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.918
Is that a tooth?

04:12.627 --> 04:14.337
Dermoid cyst. Cool.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.631
She's having a seizure.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.634
Secure her airway.
Push two milligrams Ativan.

04:23.846 --> 04:24.931
[elevator bell dings]

04:26.766 --> 04:29.185
-Thank you for trusting us enough…
-Please report.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.480
Uh, 58-year-old male dancer
with back pain.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.774
I ruled out red flags like osteomyelitis

04:34.857 --> 04:36.901
and kidney infection,
but I did find evidence

04:36.985 --> 04:39.529
of a mild L2 compression fracture
with moderate wedging

04:39.612 --> 04:41.656
and evidence of impingement
on the neural canal.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.241
You want to start beta blockers?

04:43.908 --> 04:46.244
Me? Yeah. I think
my patient's a stroke risk.

04:46.327 --> 04:47.829
BP's 200 over 105.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.291
It was the same at her gym earlier?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.551
Can you raise your arms?

05:02.969 --> 05:05.221
Okay. Now try to squeeze my hands.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.848
I just did all these tests with her.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.058
I thought you were gonna
lower my blood pressure.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.560
That would kill you.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.312
Now push against my hands.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.314
If she's in danger of having a stroke…

05:14.397 --> 05:16.024
She's not. She's already having one.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.067
Smoking on estrogen put her at high risk.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.987
Loss of circadian blood pressure variation
confirms it.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.156
Stick out your tongue.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.035
We gotta get a CTA.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.495
No. We're treating with IV tPA.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.706
-Don't we need to locate the clot?
-We just did.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.751
Right deviation means
a right vertebral artery occlusion.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.505
Oh. You can close your mouth now.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.556
[Claire] Her seizure and coma
were caused by a dermoid cyst.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.101
It's a pocket of tissue
with bits of teeth, hair, and fat.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.062
She likely got it
before she was born.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.146
What can you do?

05:55.938 --> 05:58.066
The less invasive option
is to put in a drain

05:58.149 --> 05:59.150
to release some pressure,

05:59.233 --> 06:01.444
treat with anti-seizure meds and steroids,

06:01.527 --> 06:04.405
then basically watch
to see if the swelling goes down.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.074
And the more invasive?

06:06.157 --> 06:07.158
Surgical removal.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.702
But the cyst is deep inside

06:09.786 --> 06:11.996
and wrapped around major arteries,

06:12.080 --> 06:15.666
so it is more likely to fix the problem,

06:15.750 --> 06:19.170
but it carries risk
of stroke or paralysis.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.506
[sighs]

06:22.215 --> 06:23.716
We need a decision quickly.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.885
Ellie's sister is on the paperwork,

06:25.968 --> 06:27.762
but we haven't been able to reach her.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.640
Do you know where the parents live
or any other siblings?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.774
He might still be on a business trip,
but, uh…

06:41.651 --> 06:42.652
[sighs]

06:42.735 --> 06:44.153
you can try her husband.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.915
If we can't reduce the swelling,

06:55.998 --> 06:57.708
she will have permanent brain damage.

07:05.716 --> 07:06.717
Is that him?

07:10.596 --> 07:14.100
Brendan, we need you to make a decision.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.852
Yeah, yeah.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.354
I'm… I'm not sure
that I'm the right one to…

07:21.607 --> 07:22.692
I mean, right now,

07:25.319 --> 07:26.529
I hate her.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.242
You don't.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.785
You're angry.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.495
You're hurt.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.998
Because you love her.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.009
[imperceptible]

07:48.092 --> 07:50.386
[Shaun] 58-year-old male dancer
with back pain.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.100
Moderate vertebral wedging
and impingement on the neural canal.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.394
Yes. I think an L2 compression fracture.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.358
Prescribe anti-inflammatories,
a brace, and PT,

08:04.442 --> 08:05.651
then discharge him.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.864
Do you wanna re-check anything?

08:15.828 --> 08:16.913
No.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.506
[monitor beeping]

08:27.548 --> 08:31.093
Remember to floss your brain
after every meal, people.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.388
[Claire] Aspirating.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.225
Do you think we should be doing this?

08:38.142 --> 08:39.602
I know we have to legally,

08:39.685 --> 08:42.522
but maybe her husband
isn't the one who knows her best,

08:42.605 --> 08:43.940
knows what she wants.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.900
Better than the guy
who met her last weekend.

08:45.983 --> 08:46.901
Arachnoid knife.

08:46.984 --> 08:50.279
Mm, that guy,
she's in love with him. Apparently.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.739
Well, maybe she loves them both.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.324
Aren't you a romantic!

08:53.407 --> 08:54.825
Watch for perforators.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.161
I've been polyamorous for years.

09:02.833 --> 09:06.170
When I was monogamous,
I was jealous, possessive, egotistical.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.339
Our patient wasn't honest.
That's not cool.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.423
But other than that…

09:09.507 --> 09:10.716
[inhales deeply]

09:12.134 --> 09:14.428
Good margins all around.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.931
Let's dry up the field and close her up.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.145
I never would've guessed
I was your first patient.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.647
Felt more like the fourth.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.151
By the way, did I detect an accent?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.236
No.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.657
I mean, I had one,
but I worked really hard to lose it.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.867
No one ever notices it anymore.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.036
Eastern Europe?

09:40.621 --> 09:41.706
Brooklyn.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.207
Williamsburg.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.793
I grew up Hasidic, speaking Yiddish.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.628
I left it a long time ago.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.839
You left the… the religion?

09:49.922 --> 09:51.841
The religion, the culture,

09:52.425 --> 09:53.509
my family.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.431
Must not have been easy,
growing up that way,

09:59.015 --> 10:00.224
knowing you were

10:01.183 --> 10:02.184
a doctor.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.646
Excuse me?

10:06.063 --> 10:08.190
My generation, you could get bashed.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.900
You could get thrown in jail.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.153
We had to learn codes,

10:12.236 --> 10:13.613
how to read each other.

10:13.696 --> 10:17.366
You should thank your lucky stars you get
to live your life the way you want it.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.122
I don't know what you went through.

10:23.205 --> 10:26.042
Please don't pretend to know
what I went through.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.672
Sir?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.341
My gut…

10:33.424 --> 10:34.425
[groans]

10:40.097 --> 10:41.098
Code blue!

10:43.601 --> 10:45.353
The surgery seemed successful,

10:45.436 --> 10:48.397
but we need to monitor
for seizures over the next 24 hours.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.360
-[Enrique] Is this high enough?
-Um, a little to the left.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.654
No. To the right. Yeah.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.953
You never said anything was wrong.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.667
Can we have the room for a moment?

11:08.542 --> 11:10.211
I'm sorry, but we really need to check…

11:10.294 --> 11:12.213
You're worried about talking
in front of them?

11:12.546 --> 11:13.631
Embarrassing me?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.138
I didn't think anything <i>was</i> wrong.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.224
[sighs]

11:23.474 --> 11:24.683
When I met Zane,

11:26.811 --> 11:28.729
it made me realize something was missing.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.485
Or, at least, I think
that's what I'm feeling.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.446
-[Enrique] You mind tilting your chin up?
-[Ellie] I'm sorry.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.367
Why couldn't you just talk to me?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.413
Or… Or leave me?

11:47.289 --> 11:48.499
I don't know.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.383
Were you happy?

11:58.968 --> 12:00.052
With him?

12:07.685 --> 12:08.686
[scoffs]

12:10.688 --> 12:11.897
I guess I should go.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.235
Brendan?

12:19.780 --> 12:20.865
Who are these people?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.453
Ellie, do you know where you are?

12:25.536 --> 12:26.745
Why am I in the hospital?

12:26.829 --> 12:28.122
[breathing shakily]

12:37.089 --> 12:39.508
[Shaun] Suprarenal aortic aneurysm.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.969
It ruptured as he was being discharged.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.305
-Clamping aorta now.
-How much blood is he down?

12:44.388 --> 12:45.806
We suctioned out two liters

12:45.890 --> 12:47.808
and gave six units on the rapid infuser.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.561
[Shaun] The aneurysm caused his back pain.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.021
Dr. Wolke missed it.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.399
[Asher] I did an abdominal exam.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.193
Aneurysms are very hard to catch.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.153
Experienced doctors miss them
all the time.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.237
Potts scissors.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.699
[Shaun] The aneurysm is 6.5 centimeters.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.368
Dr. Wolke should have felt it.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.583
It felt like normal musculature.

13:12.666 --> 13:13.667
I'm so sorry.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.336
We'll never know what you felt.

13:15.419 --> 13:18.172
There's no way to know
if you, or any doctor, for that matter,

13:18.255 --> 13:19.423
would have detected this.

13:20.674 --> 13:21.884
[Shaun] I would have.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.637
He asked me if I wanted to double-check.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.431
If I had, I would've caught the aneurysm
before the rupture.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.599
Stop it.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.687
He made a mistake.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.272
He might have.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.524
But you did, too.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.984
No. You told me to back off.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.111
I didn't tell you
to abdicate responsibility.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.912
When a First Year asks
if you want to re-check their work,

13:49.995 --> 13:52.081
your answer should always be "yes."

13:54.708 --> 13:56.919
The fact they're asking is a warning sign.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.966
[Shaun] I didn't know that.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.303
[sighs]

14:11.058 --> 14:14.478
It's called retrograde memory loss.
Luckily, it seems to have been temporary.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.437
She's lucid again.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.567
We're running an MRI and lab tests

14:19.650 --> 14:20.818
to see what caused it.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.029
Thank you for, uh, telling me.
I know I'm just the…

14:25.406 --> 14:26.407
You care.

14:29.577 --> 14:33.163
Maybe things with Ellie and I
weren't always perfect, but…

14:33.247 --> 14:34.331
It was exciting.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.459
When I was with her…

14:39.128 --> 14:40.713
Never felt that way before.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.798
I took care of her when she was sick.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.633
I never strayed.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.260
It wasn't about the things we did.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.553
It was… It was about

14:49.305 --> 14:50.306
being with her.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.185
She stuck by me when I needed her.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.398
Last year, I was…
I was drinking way too much.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.864
It's hard to imagine being without her.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.033
I just can't imagine being without her.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.375
She's stable.

Trust me, it'll be worth

15:51.033 --> 15:52.159
I've said that twice now.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.037
You've said a lot of things twice.
You have limited creativity.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.580
Truth is, it wasn't creative at all.

I might wanna move on.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.770
When's the last time
you dated someone?

16:19.853 --> 16:22.022
When's the last time
you acted like a human being?

16:22.106 --> 16:23.482
So, years?

16:23.565 --> 16:26.068
Yeah, I definitely found the right word.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.152

You can't sleep?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.456

16:40.249 --> 16:42.584
My mother has, like,

16:42.668 --> 16:45.087
Some of them are actual prescriptions.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.672
I can sleep

16:46.755 --> 16:49.174
but need to figure out
how to supervise better.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.805

How about tomorrow,
we have a date night?

17:07.359 --> 17:10.446
Why would we need a date night

17:10.529 --> 17:12.698
if we're in a relationship
and living together?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.366
Because it'll be fun.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.577
I'll schedule date night for tomorrow.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.829
Great. Think of something for us to do.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.252
There is one thing
that helps most people sleep

17:25.335 --> 17:27.755
that my mother did not tell me about.

Your temporary memory loss

17:45.939 --> 17:47.274

17:47.733 --> 17:49.651
We can remove it via a craniotomy,

17:49.735 --> 17:53.072
but there is a real risk
of more memory loss.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.448
Maybe permanently.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.159
What will I lose?

17:57.534 --> 17:59.244
The time prior to the surgery.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.663
Days, weeks, possibly months.

18:02.372 --> 18:03.665
But if we don't operate soon,

18:03.749 --> 18:05.584

18:07.961 --> 18:08.962
I can't do it.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.845
I don't even know what I want right now,

18:17.387 --> 18:21.016
but I do know that I don't want
the decision about my marriage

18:21.100 --> 18:22.559

18:26.939 --> 18:28.023
Please,

18:28.607 --> 18:30.025
find another answer.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.912
You are not very good at your jobs,

18:41.995 --> 18:43.580
and I'm not very good at teaching you,

18:43.664 --> 18:46.166
so we are going to
focus on one step at a time.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.377
You will master each skill separately.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.254
I've made a list of 400 skills.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.965
I didn't have the time
to finish it last night because…

18:54.007 --> 18:56.343
Dr. Wolke, you will be focusing
on physical exams.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.555
You'll find a list of the seven post-op
tests to be conducted on Carl.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.640
Dr. Jackson,
you will find relevant seminars

19:01.723 --> 19:03.642
on conquering nerves in the workplace.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.602
What are good activities for a date?

19:05.686 --> 19:06.687
Uh…

19:07.062 --> 19:08.105
What does she like?

19:08.188 --> 19:10.816
Cars, coding, <i>Zelda: Breath of the Wild,</i>

19:10.899 --> 19:13.569
Sauvignon Blanc, Skittles,
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

19:13.652 --> 19:14.653

19:14.736 --> 19:16.864
I had a very romantic time
camping in Big Sur.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.365
This is for tonight.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.286
I haven't gone on many dates.

-But everyone loves movies.
-Hmm.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.980
[breathing heavily]

19:52.107 --> 19:53.734
Look, I need to apologize.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.820
For bringing up
your personal life the other day.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.158
No.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.785
You have nothing to apologize to me for.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.374
So, what's next on your list?

20:10.417 --> 20:13.545
Checking for signs of infection
inside your abdomen.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.382
Open your eyes wider.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.723
You have signs of jaundice.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.227
I think your liver's failing.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.187
[sighs]

20:35.067 --> 20:37.361
[Shaun] The liver is being damaged
by a new aneurysm.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.988
How? A genetic predisposition or…

20:40.072 --> 20:41.865
More likely,
when we fixed the first one,

20:41.949 --> 20:43.951
we increased the pressure upstream.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.161
Can we stent the celiac?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.454
Anatomy's too tricky.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.165
Aortic to celiac bypass?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.834
We'd just risk
a new aneurysm forming upstream.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.379
Maybe, but it solves
the problem in front of us.

20:55.462 --> 20:57.047
He'll die without an intervention.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.049
He'll probably die either way.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.723
Let's all take the time
to research alternate solutions.

21:07.140 --> 21:10.394
If we can't come up
with something better in 24 hours,

21:10.477 --> 21:11.770
we proceed with the bypass.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.832
She's saying no for emotional reasons.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.752
So the answer isn't medical.

21:35.836 --> 21:36.837
It's emotional.

21:40.966 --> 21:44.052
We think Zane should talk to Ellie.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.137
No.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.180
I don't want him anywhere near her.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.683
To convince her to do the craniotomy.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.603
From you, it's self-serving.

21:53.979 --> 21:54.980
From Zane…

21:56.815 --> 21:58.108
Wait. If she doesn't want it…

21:58.191 --> 22:00.736
You said you can't imagine
life without her.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.365
If you meant that,
you'd risk anything to keep her alive.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.118
Including her memories of you.

22:20.756 --> 22:21.965

Went bananas.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.979
I've been flooded with complaints.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.272
Total nightmare.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.068
How's work? Did the videos help?

22:41.151 --> 22:42.152
Yes.

22:44.863 --> 22:45.947
Tell me more.

22:47.282 --> 22:50.786
One of my patients
developed a secondary aneurysm.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.246
Now I need to find
a surgical fix by tomorrow.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.165
Otherwise, he will probably die.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.666
I brought Skittles.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.213
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

23:01.296 --> 23:03.507
Yes. After you go to bed,

23:03.590 --> 23:05.467
I plan to go back and do research.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.596
Shaunie, go to the hospital.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.807
No, we made this schedule.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.060
Someone else needs you.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.395
More than I need you.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.689
It's a hospital.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.650
It's filled with sick people.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.236
But tomorrow, will someone need you

23:24.319 --> 23:26.113
to come up with a way
to save their life?

23:26.196 --> 23:28.031
Mm, maybe.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.662
Probably not tomorrow.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.040
Okay.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.001
Mm-hmm.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.505
[sighs]

23:44.464 --> 23:47.926
I am canceling date night.

23:48.552 --> 23:49.553
That's rude.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.637
Oh, well.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.230
Then

24:01.356 --> 24:02.440
I should

24:03.608 --> 24:04.901
go to the hospital.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.236
Mm-hmm.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.788
They're prepping Ellie for surgery.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.332
Any last-minute questions?

24:23.003 --> 24:24.212
What should I do?

24:27.340 --> 24:28.341
Forgive her.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.429
Under the right circumstances,
every human will stray.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.264
We're not hardwired for monogamy.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.309
I'm guessing you're not married.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.103
I'm not saying that it's wrong
to feel angry.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.314
She wasn't honest with you.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.443
The alternative to forgiving her

24:46.526 --> 24:47.861
is losing someone that you love.

24:52.490 --> 24:53.575
Then what?

24:55.952 --> 24:58.705
If she comes back to me
just because she forgets him…

24:59.122 --> 25:00.207
[breathes deeply]

25:01.458 --> 25:03.293
…my marriage wouldn't be honest.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.635
I have an idea.

25:14.429 --> 25:17.015
We could remove more proximal aorta

25:17.098 --> 25:18.600
and extend the graft.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.311
And rebuild the celiac trunk with what?

25:21.770 --> 25:22.771
Dacron?

25:22.854 --> 25:24.189
Branches are too complex.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.109
This <i>Lancet</i> article on polymer materials

25:29.027 --> 25:29.861
doesn't work.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.364
But thin-film nitinol?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.166
[whispering] Did we break him?

25:48.463 --> 25:51.341
We have the material.

25:54.844 --> 25:56.137
It's his veins.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.607
-Hey!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.776
Did we reestablish personal boundaries?

26:10.986 --> 26:14.906
This morning's presentation's
on who's not moving on?

26:15.824 --> 26:16.825

hillside with…

26:19.995 --> 26:21.997
With my gay best friend. Can you leave?

26:22.872 --> 26:23.707
Exhibit B.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.752
A XXL Rob Gronkowski jersey.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.713
Just the latest fashion style

26:29.796 --> 26:31.339
from a woman who hates the Patriots?

26:31.423 --> 26:32.424
Or an ex-boyfriend's…

26:32.507 --> 26:34.259
Not an ex. I hooked up with Gronk.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.510
Seemed worth preserving.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.181
Rob? Or one of his brothers?

26:42.142 --> 26:43.143
Props. I guess.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.353
Exhibit infinitum.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.897
Two ticket stubs to <i>Quantum of Solace.</i>

26:47.981 --> 26:50.692
Now, you once called
Daniel Craig "James Blonde,"

26:50.775 --> 26:52.986
and yet, 11 years later,
these were in your drawer,

26:53.069 --> 26:56.573
on top of an instruction manual
for a 2019 cellphone,

26:56.656 --> 26:58.992
which means you dug them out
within the last year.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.036
Why? I can only assume
you are currently

27:01.119 --> 27:03.496
once again hooking up
with the James Blonde fan.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.165
How could you possible deduce…

27:05.248 --> 27:06.374
I also read your e-mails.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.295
You've been sleeping with an ex
without asking for any commitment.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.339
It's sex.
It's not keeping me from anything.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.799
What's more likely
to prevent someone from moving on?

27:14.883 --> 27:17.344
A parrot in a drawer
or an ex in your bed?

27:17.427 --> 27:20.180
I'm at least getting something hot
from the situation.

27:20.263 --> 27:21.681
You're just wallowing in failure.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.145
So, if your bag's empty,

27:27.228 --> 27:29.064
I'm naked and have to go to the bathroom.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.449
It's called a Y-shaped vein graft.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.451
Your aorta is damaged from the aneurysm

27:41.534 --> 27:42.869
right where it branches off.

27:42.952 --> 27:45.872
We're gonna find a vein in your leg
that's similar in size,

27:45.955 --> 27:49.000
cut it out, and use it
to replace the damaged artery.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.001
How bad is it?

27:50.794 --> 27:52.212
This is an excellent solution.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.505
If it works.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.925
What are the actual chances
that it doesn't,

27:57.550 --> 27:58.551
that I'm gonna die?

27:59.677 --> 28:01.971
-I don't want to give a number.
-[exhales]

28:02.764 --> 28:03.848
I mean, I can't.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.602
I literally can't.
There are too many factors.

28:07.685 --> 28:08.686
I can call in Dr. Murphy…

28:08.770 --> 28:10.188
I don't need to hear numbers.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.148
How bad is this?

28:18.822 --> 28:19.823
Bad.

28:22.826 --> 28:23.827
[exhales sharply]

28:25.870 --> 28:26.871
Thank you.

28:32.335 --> 28:35.171
Whatever happens,
you're gonna be an incredible doctor.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.967
And I am honored
to have been your first patient.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.351
I screwed up.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.980
[breath trembling] That first exam,

28:53.440 --> 28:54.649
I felt something.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.612
I should have known it was an aneurysm.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.782
We could have saved you
before it got bad.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.661
Why…

29:09.831 --> 29:11.374
You were my first patient.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.669
[sighs]

29:18.965 --> 29:20.800
I need you to do something for me.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.012
I need you to pray.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.057
You must know a prayer for the sick.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.229
I'm not a believer anymore.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.106
Neither am I.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.484
But…

29:38.568 --> 29:39.569

29:56.920 --> 29:58.755

[monitor beeping]

30:31.913 --> 30:33.832
Ellie, do you know these men?

30:35.083 --> 30:36.167
Of course.

30:36.543 --> 30:37.627
Brendan.

30:40.421 --> 30:41.422
And…

30:44.259 --> 30:46.261
And are you a friend of Brendan's?

30:46.886 --> 30:47.887
[chuckles softly]

30:48.972 --> 30:50.181
Something like that.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.324
A lot has happened in the last week.

31:10.326 --> 31:14.163
So before you went under,
the doctors made a video.

31:15.748 --> 31:18.585
It's sort of, uh, a message

31:18.668 --> 31:20.295
from your old self to your new one.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.171
[chuckles]

31:24.007 --> 31:25.008
Um…

31:29.762 --> 31:31.180
I just want you to know

31:32.724 --> 31:33.808
that I love you.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.163
[Enrique on phone]
<i>Tell me about the day you met.</i>

31:55.246 --> 31:56.247
[chuckles]

31:57.040 --> 32:01.753
<i>I was in the middle</i>
<i>of an art exhibit in SoMa,</i>

32:01.836 --> 32:05.256

32:05.340 --> 32:08.760
<i>Looking at all the same paintings</i>
<i>I had been looking at.</i>

32:09.928 --> 32:13.014
[Dr. Lim] Need another 6-0 loaded backhand
for the arterial stump.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.141
[monitor beeping steadily]

32:16.976 --> 32:18.102
Graft is secure.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.604
Take off the Satinsky clamp.

32:26.235 --> 32:27.862
Good perfusion to his lower body.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.032
-[alarm beeping]
-[Jordan] Heart rate's spiking.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.868
There's no ST elevations.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.746
[monitor beeping rapidly]

32:36.829 --> 32:38.998
BP's tanking. Did he thrombose the graft?

32:41.668 --> 32:44.420
Distal anastomosis is pulsatile.

32:44.504 --> 32:48.466
But there is blood pooling
in the left lower quadrant.

32:48.549 --> 32:49.467
The right, too.

32:51.886 --> 32:53.805
He's bleeding everywhere but the graft.

32:54.931 --> 32:55.807
[Asher] It's DIC.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.308
Send a stat ROTEM and coag profile…

32:57.392 --> 32:58.685
[alarm blaring]

32:59.769 --> 33:02.397

33:43.646 --> 33:45.148
Why aren't you shocking again?

33:46.107 --> 33:48.151
He's in asystole.

33:49.736 --> 33:50.737
Dr. Lim?

34:04.751 --> 34:05.960

He's dead.

34:10.298 --> 34:11.716
[breathing heavily]

34:18.723 --> 34:20.892
[Dr. Lim] Time of death, 7:23 p.m.

[EKG switches off]

34:23.770 --> 34:24.771

Take as much time as you need.

34:31.486 --> 34:32.904
[breathing heavily]

35:12.860 --> 35:13.945
I was in love with him.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.155
All those moments I had,

35:16.739 --> 35:20.159
meeting at the gallery,
the conversations…

35:23.079 --> 35:24.705
I don't remember any of them.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.167
But they were real.

35:30.419 --> 35:31.921
And they brought up feelings.

35:34.507 --> 35:38.594
Ones I don't remember having
for a really long time.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.648
But all they made me
think of was you, Brendan.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.026
Hearing how I met Zane just reminded me

35:54.110 --> 35:57.196
how you and I met at Chelsey's party,

35:57.280 --> 35:59.490
and you showed up
in that ugly bomber jacket.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.785
And Zane taking me to the hospital

36:02.869 --> 36:05.204
reminded me how you nursed me for months

36:05.288 --> 36:06.706
when I broke my femur in Aspen.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.167
And the whole time…

36:12.503 --> 36:15.590
I just couldn't stop thinking about
how much I must have hurt you.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.725
And I…

36:27.143 --> 36:28.436
I don't know

36:29.353 --> 36:30.771
if you can forgive me.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.235
But I love you.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.705
And I… I want to come home.

36:59.425 --> 37:00.843
Well, you're wrong.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.808
That bomber jacket was really cool.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.479
[laughs]

37:12.230 --> 37:13.314
[sniffles]

37:14.398 --> 37:15.608
[crying]

37:54.021 --> 37:55.022
He died.

37:59.318 --> 38:02.071
I tried stepping back.

38:02.154 --> 38:05.241
I tried brainstorming.

38:07.868 --> 38:08.953
And he died.

38:14.583 --> 38:18.337
I don't know what people
are thinking or feeling.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.548
I can't communicate what I need.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.926
And more patients will die.

38:28.764 --> 38:33.811
You don't think your ASD had anything
to do with your patient's death, do you?

38:33.894 --> 38:35.104
Because it didn't.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.731
It did.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.735
Asher wasn't sure
about his abdominal exam.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.821
I should have known that.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.032
Shaun, you're gonna do

38:47.033 --> 38:49.660
most things better than anyone else,

38:50.786 --> 38:54.665
and there are days when you're gonna fail,
like everyone else.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.752
Today might be one of those days.

38:59.754 --> 39:00.755
So…

39:04.425 --> 39:05.634
What do you do then?

39:09.138 --> 39:10.348
[sighs deeply]

39:11.807 --> 39:13.017
You go home,

39:14.060 --> 39:15.686
you be with the people you love.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.440
You take comfort in that,

39:19.523 --> 39:22.151
and then you wake up tomorrow
and start all over again.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.080
[sighs deeply]

39:47.968 --> 39:50.179
You can go home.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.349
I just

39:56.435 --> 39:57.937
don't wanna be alone right now.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.563
[sighs]

40:40.646 --> 40:42.273
I opened a Bumble account today.

40:42.356 --> 40:43.357
Mm.

I swiped right three times today.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.203
Gronk's jersey
didn't have a tag in the back.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.289
It's symbolic.

41:00.249 --> 41:03.085
You have any idea how much the real one
will be worth one day?

Fair enough.
