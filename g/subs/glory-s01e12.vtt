WEBVTT

01:02.020 --> 01:06.024
THE GLORY

01:13.031 --> 01:14.991
Ah, I did hit that pretty well.

01:16.993 --> 01:17.952
Wow!

01:17.952 --> 01:20.330
But I can't hit that far anymore
with the driver.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.916
Hey, don't give me that.
That was almost pro-golfer level.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.544
Wow, I'm scared to go next. Seriously.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.340
<i>That man, Shin Yeong-jun.</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:32.425
How influential do you think he is?

01:34.094 --> 01:36.513
I was following him one day
and saw him go there.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.932
So, I went there twice more after that.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.102
YEONGSAN FUNERAL HOME

01:42.102 --> 01:44.104
- It's a funeral home.
- Yes.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.314
It's been out of business for three years.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.527
But then, guess what I found there?

01:52.654 --> 01:53.488
Buckle up.

02:15.051 --> 02:19.597
OUT OF BUSINESS
DO NOT ENTER

02:26.146 --> 02:28.189
Apparently, an average home consumes

02:28.189 --> 02:31.776
up to 2,000 kilowatt hours
a month at most.

02:31.776 --> 02:36.573
But the meter reads more than 5,000
at this abandoned building,

02:36.573 --> 02:38.741
and it's not the end of the month yet.

02:38.741 --> 02:41.202
So this place is
still using a ton of power?

02:41.202 --> 02:43.496
Right, and it uses the most...

02:45.373 --> 02:46.833
inside of the mortuary.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.257
MORTUARY

02:54.257 --> 02:55.175
<i>And so?</i>

02:56.092 --> 02:57.886
What do you think is inside?

02:59.929 --> 03:01.181
Son Myeong-o.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.350
Detective Shin probably
bought someone off for it.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.769
The property owner lives in LA,

03:06.769 --> 03:09.731
and the funeral home has been
up for sale for three years.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.525
A nearby lottery shop owner
takes care of the facility.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.235
I mean, do you want to check?

03:15.278 --> 03:16.154
The funeral home.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.740
Would there be a way to do that?

03:22.785 --> 03:23.661
Well then,

03:25.371 --> 03:28.208
let's make sure you've had
something good to eat first.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.168
My number one priority.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.052
It's delicious.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.553
Hey!

03:41.763 --> 03:44.766
This is private property.
You can't come in.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.352
We've gotten permission
from the owner to come.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.645
I'm a real estate agent.

03:49.687 --> 03:52.941
Real estate agent? Why?

03:52.941 --> 03:55.693
What? Didn't the owner
tell you we were coming?

03:55.693 --> 03:58.321
Looks like my phone calls
aren't the only ones you ignore.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.074
We're here to check out the property.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.367
Open the gate, please.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.327
We've already talked to the owner.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.748
What? Uh, wait, hold on a minute.
I need to call someone.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.460
Who are you calling?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
Mr. Shin Yeong-jun, maybe?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.490
So this is what you've been
keeping watch over?

04:42.490 --> 04:44.534
You only set up the lottery shop recently.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.451
Huh?

04:45.451 --> 04:47.036
Actually, until we met you,

04:47.870 --> 04:50.331
we weren't sure
if Shin was really behind it.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.542
Now, we know he is.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.003
Why'd you come here? To trick me?

04:56.796 --> 04:57.839
What do you plan to do now?

04:57.839 --> 05:00.842
Why are you asking me?
Aren't you going to call the police?

05:01.676 --> 05:02.552
No, we're not.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.847
You're not going to call them?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.558
You're serious?

05:10.435 --> 05:11.769
But why? Why not?

05:13.187 --> 05:14.772
Since they vacuum sealed the body,

05:14.772 --> 05:18.067
it means they were delaying
the decaying process to conserve evidence.

05:18.818 --> 05:19.819
But why?

05:20.528 --> 05:22.238
Maybe it's like some insurance?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.949
While Shin was covering up
what Yeon-jin did,

05:24.949 --> 05:27.410
he developed an ulterior motive.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.454
How sure are you?

05:29.454 --> 05:31.372
Shin could've done it himself.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.333
Ninety-nine percent?

05:33.958 --> 05:37.128
If it had been up to him,
he wouldn't have left anything behind.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.629
He wouldn't have kept the body.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.716
Why leave out that 1%?

05:42.925 --> 05:43.968
Don't know.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.346
Fate?

05:47.722 --> 05:49.974
Luck has never been on my side.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.396
Then let me make up for what is missing.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.361
I'll make it a full 100% for you.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.155
But how?

06:04.155 --> 06:06.824
Is there a way
to get Park Yeon-jin to my clinic?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.994
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

06:09.994 --> 06:13.414
The man who bought me this
was your husband, Yeon-jin.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.709
And it was your husband
who told me he plays Go with Dong-eun.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.503
It's a small fucking world, right?

06:20.880 --> 06:24.550
I've heard of some extraordinary winters
that are warmer than usual...

06:26.761 --> 06:30.890
and that these warm winters
create a thick fog, obscuring things.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.059
But once the fog clears,

06:33.643 --> 06:37.188
you have no idea
how cold it can get, Ms. Park.

06:42.026 --> 06:47.824
THE GLORY

06:47.824 --> 06:51.619
Hey, so have you looked into
the guy Dong-eun is seeing?

06:52.328 --> 06:53.162
Yeah.

06:53.162 --> 06:56.290
He's a plastic surgeon
who opened a clinic in Semyeong.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.376
A surgeon?

06:58.376 --> 06:59.293
No way.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.254
He's very young and accomplished,

07:01.254 --> 07:03.256
and his clinic is always full.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.924
And don't get me started about his looks.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.218
- So tall, all the way--
- Focus, lady!

07:08.386 --> 07:09.387
Oh, sorry.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.764
His name is Joo Yeo-jeong,

07:11.764 --> 07:14.642
and he comes from
a family full of doctors.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.104
Joo Yeo-jeong?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.148
Son Myeong-o?

07:20.898 --> 07:22.900
You said that several times that day.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.696
That asshole.

07:28.656 --> 07:29.699
Who is his family?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.536
They aren't connected
to Joo General Hospital, right?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.204
Oh, how did you know?

07:35.204 --> 07:38.166
I heard that his family owns
Seoul Joo Hospital.

07:41.794 --> 07:45.173
<i>This weekend, we'll see
cloudy skies and rain nationwide.</i>

07:45.173 --> 07:47.550
<i>Due to a trough passing through the north,</i>

07:47.550 --> 07:49.552
<i>rain will form above the west coast.</i>

07:49.552 --> 07:52.305
<i>Then we'll see rain
in the central regions of the country,</i>

07:52.305 --> 07:55.057
<i>and it will continue to move inland.</i>

07:55.057 --> 07:58.644
<i>According to our forecast,
it will continue to rain into next week.</i>

07:58.644 --> 08:01.147
<i>Next Thursday is the winter solstice,</i>

08:01.147 --> 08:04.442
<i>which is the longest night
and the shortest day in the year.</i>

08:04.442 --> 08:07.862
<i>People once believed a fair-weather
winter solstice was a bad omen,</i>

08:07.862 --> 08:10.323
<i>causing many diseases
and deaths in the following year.</i>

08:12.408 --> 08:15.578
SEOUL JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL

08:46.734 --> 08:47.985
NEW MESSAGE
MISSED CALL

08:50.404 --> 08:51.822
I KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER
KILLED SOMEBODY

08:51.822 --> 08:54.951
<i>You'd better reply,
or you might find yourself in trouble.</i>

09:05.378 --> 09:07.672
After last time,
I'm practicing like crazy.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.923
Are you?

09:11.509 --> 09:12.385
See you in the office.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.469
HONG YEONG-AE

09:13.469 --> 09:14.554
Yeah, sounds good.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.195
Jesus!

09:33.864 --> 09:35.533
Are you insane?
You can't just show up here.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.327
You're ignoring my calls!
You won't return my texts!

09:38.828 --> 09:39.745
You won't even show up!

09:40.329 --> 09:42.873
I have to stick around here
until 6:00, or I'll get fired. Okay?

09:42.873 --> 09:44.458
Then maybe you shouldn't have asked me

09:44.458 --> 09:46.294
for more money
than what they're paying you.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.337
You think all that money in the bank

09:48.337 --> 09:49.672
was really yours?

09:52.466 --> 09:54.218
I get it, okay? Can you calm down?

09:54.218 --> 09:55.761
Don't touch me!

09:55.761 --> 09:58.973
That crazy bastard
never stops calling or texting me!

09:58.973 --> 10:01.475
And that's why I sent you
all his personal info.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.185
What am I supposed to do with that?

10:03.185 --> 10:05.980
You should have taken care of it,
you worthless piece of shit!

10:10.443 --> 10:11.485
That was a step too far.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.778
A step too far?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.448
A civil servant like you

10:15.448 --> 10:18.367
got a house in New Zealand
and paid for his family to study abroad.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.619
Is that a step too far?

10:19.619 --> 10:22.121
You could barely pay your mortgage,

10:22.121 --> 10:24.165
but now you have a motel
under your sister's name.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.042
Is that a step too far? Should I go on?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.460
You!

10:28.461 --> 10:29.879
You were just a pathetic loser.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.507
I even bought charms to protect you
from your own terrible life.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.635
I'm the reason you live like you do.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.721
Are you trying to take credit
for everything I did?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.264
Credit?

10:41.015 --> 10:43.142
You were more obedient
when you were taking my money.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.226
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

10:47.647 --> 10:49.899
All of this is starting to get old,
Yeong-ae.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.362
Especially this hold
that you have over me, my friend.

10:56.155 --> 10:59.283
I guess there's no friendship here,
is there?

11:00.242 --> 11:02.286
We're just accomplices, right?

11:06.540 --> 11:08.584
<i>Express delivery.</i>

11:23.557 --> 11:25.101
<i>What is this picture?</i>

11:25.101 --> 11:26.936
It's from a school newsletter.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.523
I was debating whether I should
send it to you or Ha Do-yeong.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.732
I chose you.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.609
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

11:33.609 --> 11:35.069
You're Ye-sol's father.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.864
And so? What is this?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.283
<i>His name is Chu Jeong-ho.</i>

11:41.283 --> 11:44.870
<i>He's a teacher at Semyeong
who often photographs the kids there.</i>

11:44.870 --> 11:47.415
Ye-sol is also in
that picture you just got.

12:05.766 --> 12:06.642
Fuck, move!

12:06.642 --> 12:09.603
Move before I run over your shitty car,
you stupid motherfucker.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.439
Move, you fucking son of a bitch!

12:11.439 --> 12:13.232
Who the fuck do you think you are?

12:13.816 --> 12:15.443
Get the fuck out of my way.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.612
Jesus Christ. I'll kill you,
you fucking son of a bitch.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.868
I can climb all the way to the top.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.453
All the way up there.

12:25.453 --> 12:29.165
I can hang upside down
when I get there and hang from my knees.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.585
Really? Wow, how brave of you.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.087
Who wants to show me
how good you really are?

12:42.261 --> 12:44.388
Hey girls, time to get going.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.475
Your sitters are waiting.
What are you doing here?

12:47.475 --> 12:49.435
Wash your hands.
Get your backpacks. Let's go.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.437
Yes, ma'am.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.776
Hey, careful now.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.538
Why does it seem like you're
always hovering, Ms. Moon? That's rude.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.957
I just finished up
what you asked me to do.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.543
Would you like me
to print it out or send it to you online?

13:19.673 --> 13:23.636
<i>What do you think
is the fastest way to get rid of Mr. Chu?</i>

13:23.636 --> 13:24.970
<i>Any ideas, Yeon-jin?</i>

13:26.180 --> 13:27.765
<i>My way won't be pretty.</i>

13:27.765 --> 13:31.310
<i>But I don't have time to waste
on garbage like him.</i>

13:31.310 --> 13:33.062
I don't think you'll get it...

13:35.481 --> 13:37.107
if I say this nicely.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.609
So I'll be direct.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.486
Please go ahead.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.244
I...

13:49.662 --> 13:52.122
hate insubordinate bitches.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.501
I respect your opinion.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.216
I've had it with you.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.887
Follow me out.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.976
Where can I find Mr. Chu?

14:15.229 --> 14:16.480
Hello, can I help you?

14:16.480 --> 14:17.481
Yes, you can.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.943
You can help me find
that fucking son of a bitch.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.571
Right here.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.239
Who are you?

14:30.953 --> 14:32.288
What's this about?

14:32.288 --> 14:34.039
Yeah, it's you?

14:37.585 --> 14:38.544
Then this...

14:42.464 --> 14:43.757
is your camera, right?

14:50.806 --> 14:52.516
All right, come here.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.568
Call the cops! Call the cops!

15:04.570 --> 15:06.280
Who are you? Why are you--

15:06.280 --> 15:07.239
Shut the fuck up.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.866
Clench your teeth

15:08.866 --> 15:10.993
if you don't want to swallow them.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.746
And I don't think you want
the cops involved, pervert!

15:17.625 --> 15:18.876
Hello, police?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.670
Yes, this is Semyeong Elementary.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.631
- Wait!
- Shut the fuck up!

15:23.631 --> 15:26.008
Someone burst in
and is beating up one of our teachers.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.388
Take this.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.727
I put together
what we got from last year's field trips.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.313
I thought they might help you.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.233
If there's...

15:44.818 --> 15:46.320
anything else in there,

15:47.112 --> 15:47.988
it's an accident.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.867
Please don't tell anyone.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.747
Why did you help me?

15:58.540 --> 16:01.377
It took a lot of courage for me
to be standing here now.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.798
I can't start this fight
with the things you'll see there,

16:07.841 --> 16:09.635
but I think that maybe you could.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.315
Wait, hold on!

16:29.822 --> 16:31.490
- Come here, asshole.
- Please stop.

17:07.609 --> 17:11.155
Ye-sol, stop crying. Talk a little slower.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.073
I don't understand what you mean.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.117
You're saying Uncle Jae-jun...

17:18.037 --> 17:19.663
He came to school and did what?

17:21.206 --> 17:24.960
Wow, this is pretty, right?
Flowers always look good on you.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.462
Try it on.

17:28.922 --> 17:32.676
You know what? You and I should go
to the beach when the money comes in.

17:34.511 --> 17:38.265
I've been on the receiving end enough
to know blackmail makes everyone fold.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.933
That bitch won't last long.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.686
Come on now.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.730
We should forget about it.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.232
This is too dangerous, you know?

17:47.232 --> 17:48.901
Hey, come on. Don't give me that shit.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.695
Damn it, you're always so...

17:54.281 --> 17:55.741
I'll deal with you at home, okay?

17:57.242 --> 17:59.953
There's someone else she killed.
She killed two people!

18:01.663 --> 18:02.915
Not just one.

18:05.918 --> 18:06.960
Two?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.341
Philippines.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.552
I heard it's amazing in the Philippines.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.931
I hear mangos are cheap there.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.517
I'll buy this for you soon. Try it on.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.601
Just try it on.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.613
- Hey, I have a question.
- What?

18:34.613 --> 18:38.742
Back at the shop, where that guy
got his head smashed in.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.078
Why bring that up?

18:41.078 --> 18:44.540
Why wasn't whatever that was used,
you know, to smash his head...

18:44.540 --> 18:46.333
Why wasn't it still here?

18:50.712 --> 18:52.714
Don't worry. Who cares about that?

18:53.257 --> 18:54.716
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.322
Thank you for last time.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.593
Seong-hee said
that you're not going to use it yourself.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.677
Right.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.892
Can you prepare this for me?

19:45.434 --> 19:47.186
I don't know how it works.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.817
Just let me go!
Why won't you both just fucking let me go?

19:53.817 --> 19:56.945
It's legal in the Netherlands.
I'd never have to come back.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.822
Come on, let me go!

19:58.822 --> 20:01.033
You said she's sober. You call this sober?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.367
This is your fault.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.536
How could you let her
turn into a child of the devil?

20:04.536 --> 20:09.166
Honey, I think at this point,
she needs to be checked into a rehab--

20:09.166 --> 20:11.960
You want everyone to know
the pastor's daughter is a junkie?

20:11.960 --> 20:14.379
This is why I didn't want to leave Paris!

20:14.379 --> 20:15.756
- You ungrateful--
- Honey, stop.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.549
You think we wanted you back here?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.801
The community in Paris was gossiping

20:19.801 --> 20:22.888
that you were doing drugs every night
and sleeping in the streets like a whore!

20:22.888 --> 20:24.514
He's right, Sa-ra.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.643
We can take care of you here in Korea
and get you some help.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.479
You don't even speak Dutch,
so why don't you stay home?

20:30.479 --> 20:34.316
You know I hate living here.
Why can't I live in the Netherlands?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.526
I wanna go! Let me go! I want to live!

20:36.526 --> 20:38.528
Get me out of here! Let me go!

20:38.528 --> 20:41.031
Dad, just let me fucking go!

20:42.115 --> 20:43.158
Damn it!

20:43.158 --> 20:46.370
Where are you going? I want to go now!

20:48.163 --> 20:50.457
The victim is
willing to accept a settlement.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.834
- If you and the victim--
- Who's the victim?

20:52.834 --> 20:54.586
He's the criminal.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.213
Don't call that fucking pervert a victim

20:56.213 --> 20:58.215
when he's been taking
dirty pics of little girls!

20:58.215 --> 21:01.218
I just need to know if you're willing
to settle regarding the assault.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.305
The photos are a different matter, right?

21:05.889 --> 21:07.975
The law is really fucking strange, huh?

21:07.975 --> 21:10.227
The fuck's he talking about?
Are you gonna say something?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.687
You should stop talking.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.898
I'll be speaking for my client.
We're willing to settle.

21:14.898 --> 21:18.652
I won't settle with that asshole.
That fucker should be rotting in jail!

21:22.364 --> 21:24.700
Hello. You're the one
I spoke to on the phone?

21:24.700 --> 21:29.663
I am. I'm Choi Won-seok,
from Jaepyeong Construction's legal team.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.415
What the hell?

21:31.415 --> 21:36.628
Here. This is the agreement I mentioned
when we spoke on the phone.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.713
Thank you so much.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.050
Hey, you fucking insane?
I didn't agree to this.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.761
Shut the fuck up.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.432
You're the one going to jail
if we don't settle.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.790
I reached out because I figured
it'd be easier to get a settlement

22:13.790 --> 22:15.334
if Jaepyeong were involved.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.544
Right, and regarding the photos
that were taken,

22:17.544 --> 22:19.087
we will be pressing charges.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.131
Both civil and criminal.

22:21.131 --> 22:25.135
Why would you get involved?
I should be the one to do that.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.137
Don't you think?

22:29.681 --> 22:31.183
What could you do?

22:32.309 --> 22:33.477
Please tell me.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.272
Tell me, what right do you have
to press charges?

22:40.901 --> 22:41.902
You know, right?

22:43.111 --> 22:44.237
Don't you?

22:45.697 --> 22:47.157
You know I'm Ye-sol's father.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.288
You're an even bigger son of a bitch
than I thought you were.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.666
I'm warning you, back off.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.920
This fucking asshole.

23:02.130 --> 23:05.133
- You shouldn't do this here!
- We're outside a police station!

23:05.133 --> 23:06.051
Please don't do this!

23:08.553 --> 23:10.097
Hey, you fucking...

23:29.116 --> 23:30.617
You fucker!

23:37.958 --> 23:39.418
That's enough now, stop!

23:39.418 --> 23:41.420
- Why?
- Stop it, please, sir!

23:41.420 --> 23:43.255
Hey, hold on. Let me go.

23:44.297 --> 23:45.424
Oh, shit!

23:47.175 --> 23:48.677
Fuck you, let me go!

23:48.677 --> 23:49.761
I let you go.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.848
I'm not doing this for you.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.475
My family is none of your business.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.602
You should go.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.312
And I'm warning you,

23:59.312 --> 24:01.898
never come near
my daughter again, asshole.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.077
Shit.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.832
The police said what?

24:18.832 --> 24:21.251
They received a report about the hospital?

24:21.251 --> 24:23.837
Yes, for illegal storage of a corpse.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.340
They want to search the morgue
and the freezer. What should we do?

24:31.011 --> 24:32.262
Where's the body now?

24:34.264 --> 24:37.184
We've conducted an autopsy.
We can't hold her body anymore.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.101
WINTER OF 2004

24:38.101 --> 24:41.271
If we don't do anything with her body,
the corpse will rot.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.273
You have to have a funeral for her.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.859
EVERYTHING WILL BE OVER
IF WE HOLD THE FUNERAL

24:45.859 --> 24:48.111
IT'S UNFAIR, SO UNFAIR

24:48.945 --> 24:51.948
PLEASE, HELP ME

24:51.948 --> 24:53.533
PLEASE

24:53.533 --> 24:55.076
PLEASE HELP
MY POOR DAUGHTER, DOCTOR

24:55.076 --> 24:56.745
Doing this here won't help you!

24:57.704 --> 25:00.665
I need to know
you understand what I'm telling you.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.168
AGREEMENT TO HOLD FUNERAL

25:03.168 --> 25:04.961
Please review this, and then sign.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.380
You can sign with a thumbprint.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.261
Please, ma'am! You have to sign.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.391
This whole thing is tragic.
Without the family's consent,

25:18.391 --> 25:20.810
we aren't allowed
to do anything with the body.

25:20.810 --> 25:21.811
No, we can't.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.814
The temperature in the morgue
isn't enough to preserve her.

25:24.814 --> 25:28.568
Right. Body will decompose
within six months.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.905
Think of the discharge from the decay,
not to mention the smell.

25:31.905 --> 25:32.822
I know.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.909
Clearly, we should move the body
to the freezer.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.410
Huh? What?

25:38.078 --> 25:40.914
Oh, don't even joke about that, sir!

25:41.998 --> 25:44.626
She says it wasn't a suicide.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.963
This whole situation isn't our concern.

25:47.963 --> 25:51.049
The hospital can't be held liable
for incurred costs.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.927
I think it'll be sorted out soon.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.012
They say good triumphs over evil.

25:58.431 --> 26:01.518
Let's take care of her
until things get sorted out.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.939
I've been informed
there was a civil complaint.

26:07.023 --> 26:11.444
Still, I can't wrap my mind around
how strange this is.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.948
Hospital staff would be
the only ones inconvenienced,

26:15.532 --> 26:19.077
and I'm not sure
why there's a problem after all this time.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.621
Also, why would someone
report this to the police,

26:21.621 --> 26:24.916
not the Ministry of Health and Welfare?

26:28.503 --> 26:31.506
Hard to say, but we're obligated
to investigate this case.

26:32.090 --> 26:35.385
I need the body moved back to the morgue.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.014
I filed the report.
Understand what I'm saying?

26:40.682 --> 26:41.600
Yeah.

26:42.517 --> 26:45.645
So you admit that the hospital moved
the body from the morgue to the freezer,

26:45.645 --> 26:46.896
without the family's consent?

26:46.896 --> 26:49.441
And the intentions
behind that decision were unclear.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.525
"Intentions"?

26:50.525 --> 26:53.278
You could have moved the body
to conduct illegal experiments,

26:53.278 --> 26:54.904
or for any other number of reasons.

26:55.989 --> 26:59.909
That said, you must move the body
back to the morgue.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.203
We won't.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.664
If there's been a crime here,
we'll accept punishment.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.876
Till then, the body stays in the freezer.

27:10.378 --> 27:11.671
This girl's death was suspicious...

27:11.671 --> 27:13.214
PROCESSED ON 12/15/2004
YOON SO-HEE

27:13.214 --> 27:15.008
...and we've yet to find the real truth.

27:16.551 --> 27:17.969
That's our intention.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.639
Have I made myself clear?

27:27.062 --> 27:28.396
Oh, piece of shit.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.815
You better text me back

27:30.815 --> 27:32.901
or pick up your fucking phone.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.487
Too busy to talk?

27:44.829 --> 27:46.790
Let me just see here.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.876
COME MEET ME,
I HAVE THINGS TO SAY

27:49.876 --> 27:50.960
YOU MUST BE IGNORING ME

27:50.960 --> 27:52.629
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
THIS NUMBER

27:52.629 --> 27:53.963
BUT I'M DONG-EUN'S MOM

27:53.963 --> 27:55.215
YOU HAVE TO MEET YOUR...

28:02.972 --> 28:04.683
Aw, come on!

28:07.644 --> 28:08.645
Damn it!

28:11.022 --> 28:12.941
YOU HAVE TO MEET
YOUR FUTURE MOTHER-IN-LAW

28:12.941 --> 28:13.858
HOW RUDE OF YOU

28:17.153 --> 28:18.988
I want pickles.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.573
I'll pay.

28:21.908 --> 28:24.828
- Including that person.
- Bring me more!

28:46.599 --> 28:47.851
Why are you here?

28:49.269 --> 28:51.187
You didn't go pick up Ye-sol?

28:51.187 --> 28:53.940
Ye-sol got out early
and went to her grandmother's.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.443
Mr. Ha is inside, ma'am.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.619
<i>I requested
a temporary restraining order</i>

29:06.619 --> 29:07.829
<i>against Mr. Jeon Jae-jun.</i>

29:07.829 --> 29:09.497
<i>We'll proceed as quickly as we can.</i>

29:10.331 --> 29:11.332
I see, good work.

29:11.332 --> 29:13.835
I'm going to visit a site.
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.004
Why did you send Ye-sol to your mother's?

29:16.004 --> 29:18.131
I have my reasons. We'll talk later.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.966
I have to hear it from the drive...

29:21.092 --> 29:21.926
What happened?

29:23.762 --> 29:24.846
A fight?

29:24.846 --> 29:26.389
I don't think we should talk now,

29:26.389 --> 29:28.349
because I don't have
anything nice to say to you.

29:28.349 --> 29:31.311
So I can't even ask
why my daughter left school early?

29:32.312 --> 29:34.481
Why are you acting so superior right now?

29:35.190 --> 29:38.943
I'd rather have an argument.
I'd rather you be mean.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.572
Fine. Then let's talk.

29:43.907 --> 29:47.076
I'm not sure where to start,
but this is as good a place as any.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.956
My wife's lover went
to my daughter's school,

29:51.956 --> 29:53.500
claiming to be her father.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.336
Wanna argue now?

30:02.175 --> 30:03.927
You're wondering if I know

30:05.512 --> 30:07.013
who is Ye-sol's father.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.352
I know everything. All your secrets.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.986
You have no idea
how much I'm holding back!

30:25.031 --> 30:26.533
Even after all of this,

30:26.533 --> 30:29.202
the only thing
you truly care about is yourself.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.705
Ye-sol is suffering...

30:35.625 --> 30:37.544
and you want to argue with me?

30:40.046 --> 30:41.047
At least...

30:42.882 --> 30:44.551
I tried to protect us

30:45.635 --> 30:46.886
with these secrets.

30:48.429 --> 30:50.932
You destroyed it by dragging it all out.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.851
What did you want to protect?

30:53.977 --> 30:56.646
Our marriage, your career,
Ye-sol, your lover?

30:59.232 --> 31:01.067
You couldn't protect any of it.

31:07.156 --> 31:08.908
Let me make this very clear.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.079
Ye-sol's mine...

31:15.874 --> 31:17.292
even if you're not.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.650
SEUNG-A'S MOM

31:44.444 --> 31:45.278
How are you, girl?

31:45.278 --> 31:47.196
<i>Why aren't you answering my texts?</i>

31:47.196 --> 31:49.532
<i>What do you think
about this whole bribery thing?</i>

31:49.532 --> 31:51.284
<i>We're headed to the school now.</i>

31:51.284 --> 31:53.036
<i>You coming? We need your vote?</i>

31:53.036 --> 31:54.829
<i>It's a total mess over there!</i>

31:54.829 --> 31:57.040
<i>Also, did you hear
one of the teachers got arrested?</i>

31:57.040 --> 31:58.541
<i>Isn't that crazy?</i>

31:58.541 --> 32:00.376
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't text.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.712
I'm at work right now.

32:03.296 --> 32:04.881
Can you actually vote on my behalf?

32:06.549 --> 32:08.885
Bribes, huh? That's insane.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.721
A teacher like that should be fired.

32:59.435 --> 33:02.105
FROM KIM SI-U'S MOM

33:15.660 --> 33:18.621
What are you doing? You should have
let me know you were coming.

33:18.621 --> 33:21.708
Leave these alone.
I haven't taken the tags off yet.

33:22.583 --> 33:23.710
Get off!

33:24.419 --> 33:26.045
Hey! Hey!

33:26.045 --> 33:27.130
Stop!

33:30.967 --> 33:33.386
That was the last thing
you should've done to me.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.805
You can track me down here and show up

33:35.805 --> 33:38.641
and invade my life
like the shameless bitch you are,

33:38.641 --> 33:40.059
but the one thing you shouldn't have done

33:40.059 --> 33:42.478
is side with the monster
who ruined my life!

33:44.564 --> 33:46.107
How could you do this again?

33:47.442 --> 33:49.861
How could you abandon me like this again?

33:50.528 --> 33:51.612
It was the one thing...

33:53.656 --> 33:56.534
the one thing
that you never, ever should have done!

33:57.118 --> 34:00.621
Do you even know how much these are worth?

34:08.254 --> 34:09.255
Hey!

34:11.299 --> 34:12.133
Don't do that!

34:12.717 --> 34:13.551
Stop it!

34:14.135 --> 34:15.553
Fuck! Stupid!

34:19.515 --> 34:20.558
Hey,

34:20.558 --> 34:21.768
you crazy bitch!

35:43.349 --> 35:44.976
Hey, what are you doing?

35:46.561 --> 35:47.562
Come out.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.439
Let's have a parent-teacher conference.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.777
I saw Ha Do-yeong at the police station.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.615
Thought I was the only one you told.
Are you two-timing me or what?

36:01.450 --> 36:02.869
Get out of the car, bitch!

36:06.080 --> 36:08.958
Whoa! Whoa!

36:10.459 --> 36:11.586
Yeah, go on.

36:12.545 --> 36:13.546
Hit me!

36:14.255 --> 36:16.924
Go on and hit me,
you fucking loser!

36:28.311 --> 36:29.145
Are you okay?

36:33.858 --> 36:36.944
Oh man, I just recently got this car.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.363
I'm still adjusting to it.
Did you get hurt?

36:42.241 --> 36:44.952
Oh my God, it's this asshole.
Fucking crazy.

36:48.789 --> 36:49.790
Are you drunk?

36:49.790 --> 36:53.085
Why'd you stand in front of someone's car
in the pouring rain?

36:53.085 --> 36:54.670
And dressed in all black.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.757
If it weren't for my high-performance car,
I could've hit you.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.470
Man, be more careful next time.
You don't wanna die, right?

37:03.095 --> 37:03.930
What?

37:04.513 --> 37:05.681
Jesus Christ.

37:06.641 --> 37:07.975
You're a fucking psycho.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.519
Here, this is my card.

37:12.855 --> 37:15.650
Now you know how to reach out
if you need anything from me, right?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.402
I'm a bit busy right now.

37:25.159 --> 37:26.661
I'm turning it around.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.122
If you keep standing there,
I will hit you this time!

37:36.462 --> 37:39.465
Whoa, whoa! Hey! Stop! Hey!

37:39.465 --> 37:40.633
Hey! Hey! Stop! Shit.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.219
Get out of the car.

37:43.844 --> 37:44.804
Get out, asshole!

37:52.395 --> 37:53.479
Hey.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.564
Hey.

37:56.148 --> 37:56.983
Hey!

38:00.820 --> 38:02.905
Shit. What the fuck is wrong with him?

38:09.620 --> 38:13.499
I'm gonna give up my lease.
You have one week to vacate it.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.168
I hope that today

38:17.712 --> 38:20.589
is the last time that you and I
ever see each other again.

38:21.674 --> 38:24.760
Stop giving me all this crap
and get out of here.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.764
How many times do I have to tell you?

38:28.764 --> 38:30.599
Blood is thicker than water.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.560
Dong-eun, you remember that.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.606
I just need
a sub-document from the county,

38:37.606 --> 38:41.319
and it'll tell me right where you are.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.451
Go on. Run then.

38:50.453 --> 38:53.914
Let's see if you can hide,
or if I find you.

39:20.858 --> 39:21.859
I'm okay in here.

39:21.859 --> 39:22.943
You?

39:26.614 --> 39:28.115
That's good. I'm okay too.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.619
What are you up to out there right now?

39:32.328 --> 39:33.371
You know.

39:35.498 --> 39:39.168
Just trying to show you I'm here.

39:40.669 --> 39:41.754
Was it obvious?

39:49.845 --> 39:52.681
Can I ask, how did you find me out there?

39:56.811 --> 39:59.980
Your mother reached out to me.
She found my phone number.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.359
Park Yeon-jin must have given it to her.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.199
Well, just so you know,

40:11.033 --> 40:12.284
I'm sleeping in,

40:13.035 --> 40:15.621
and I also plan to sleep early tonight.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.292
So just get some rest.

40:23.295 --> 40:24.922
Good night, then.

40:30.386 --> 40:31.387
Good night.

40:59.331 --> 41:00.666
WHERE'S YOUR CLINIC?
I CAN COME TO YOU

41:00.666 --> 41:01.584
I HEARD YOU'RE A DOCTOR

41:01.584 --> 41:03.127
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS
AND BUY YOU A MEAL

41:20.144 --> 41:23.564
SUNGHAN FAITH CHURCH

41:29.278 --> 41:31.030
Hello. Good morning.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.911
Here you go. The photos are saved on it.

41:44.668 --> 41:48.589
Hello, ma'am. It's me. I'm calling
because I thought you should know.

41:49.673 --> 41:53.511
Well, Moon Dong-eun
is now entering a church.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.595
A church?

41:55.513 --> 41:59.266
What, is she going to repent
all of a sudden now?

41:59.266 --> 42:02.853
I don't know. Who knows
if God's even listening right now?

42:02.853 --> 42:04.021
Hey, lady!

42:05.439 --> 42:06.941
So why should I care?

42:07.525 --> 42:10.861
Well, ma'am, the church she's at right now

42:11.737 --> 42:15.491
is the one that's owned
by the parents of your friend, you know?

42:32.758 --> 42:35.386
I INVITE YOU
TO THE GARDEN OF EDEN, SISTER

43:49.335 --> 43:50.919
Thank you!

43:50.919 --> 43:52.004
Amen.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.885
<i>You're not an artist.
You're just a junkie.</i>

44:41.053 --> 44:42.096
Son Myeong-o?

44:43.639 --> 44:45.307
You're the fucking devil.

44:52.981 --> 44:53.982
Go back.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.236
Go crawl back into the fucking wall!

45:11.875 --> 45:13.877
You know how to crawl, too.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.630
I remember how well you crawled that day.

45:18.298 --> 45:19.216
Just think.

45:20.175 --> 45:23.637
Think about it, Sa-ra. Try to remember
how you crawled like an animal.

45:54.835 --> 45:55.836
I remember.

46:00.090 --> 46:01.884
I remember it now.

47:20.546 --> 47:21.630
Was it you?

47:23.131 --> 47:23.966
You did this?

47:25.592 --> 47:28.512
This took a lot of effort. Do you like it?

47:31.640 --> 47:33.392
You're doing all this for nothing.

47:33.892 --> 47:36.186
Sa-ra's only a first-time offender.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.563
She'll get out soon.

47:38.772 --> 47:40.357
You won't bring us down.

47:41.066 --> 47:41.900
Really?

47:42.734 --> 47:45.737
You're gonna try your best
to not get brought down,

47:46.613 --> 47:48.448
Weather Forecaster A.

47:53.996 --> 47:58.000
EXPOSING WEATHER FORECASTER A

48:29.156 --> 48:31.116
HTN COLLEAGUES GROUP CHAT
SAW THE SCHOOL VIOLENCE ARTICLE

48:31.116 --> 48:32.200
DRUGS?
FORECASTER WHO?

48:32.200 --> 48:33.118
PROBABLY DRUGS CRAZY

48:41.209 --> 48:42.961
Bitch, what the fuck have you done?

48:44.212 --> 48:47.049
Sa-ra might get out of this,
but you definitely won't.

48:47.549 --> 48:49.968
You're a murderer,
and he wasn't the first.

48:54.389 --> 48:55.807
YEONGSAN FUNERAL HOME

49:07.402 --> 49:08.403
Prove it, then.

49:09.571 --> 49:12.407
Do you have some proof?

49:14.534 --> 49:16.036
You have no idea.
