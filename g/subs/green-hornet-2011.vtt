00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
THE GREEN HORNET (2011)

00:56.181 --> 00:57.014
Daily Sentinel.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.724
One minute, please.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.438
The mayor doesn't want the article
to print until after the next quarter.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.026
Tell the mayor I'm insulted.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.613
I'd never jeopardise the journalistic
integrity of this newspaper...

01:12.781 --> 01:15.157
...for some rent-a-mayor's
political agenda.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.366
Very well, Mr.--

01:20.163 --> 01:21.538
So, Britt.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.958
Here we are again.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.962
Sent home after another
schoolyard fight.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.256
I know you miss your mother.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.050
So do l.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.930
But l have to take care
of 750 employees...

01:38.098 --> 01:40.724
...and you have to
take care of yourself.

01:41.476 --> 01:45.604
Still, that seems to be
asking too much.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.398
I was trying to stop some bullies
and the guy hit me.

01:48.566 --> 01:51.151
Trying doesn't matter
when you always fail.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.447
No! No!

01:59.702 --> 02:01.787
Do you think it makes
me happy to do this?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.622
-Yes!
-No, it doesn't.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.793
But not a week goes by without you
finding yourself in trouble.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.044
If you're doing this for attention...

02:10.213 --> 02:12.548
...you have all that l can
afford to give you.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.508
And you're wasting my time.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.585
Frank!

02:53.840 --> 02:55.591
No, no. Not you.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.977
Have a seat.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.647
Either one.
They're both very comfortable.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.238
So, what can l do for you?

03:18.406 --> 03:19.406
As you know...

03:19.741 --> 03:23.952
...l've worked my entire life,
very hard, to achieve one goal.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.622
And that goal...

03:26.789 --> 03:28.999
...which I have,
in fact, achieved...

03:29.459 --> 03:33.045
...was to be in charge of all the crime
in the city of Los Angeles.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.380
Therefore...

03:36.174 --> 03:38.300
...the fact that you assume
that you can...

03:38.468 --> 03:40.886
...open this establishment
without my permission...

03:41.054 --> 03:45.390
...without payment, and sell narcotics
out of it, is completely unacceptable.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.558
Really?

03:46.726 --> 03:47.935
And, to be honest...

03:48.144 --> 03:49.436
...quite insulting.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.065
Therefore, you must
sign over ownership...

03:53.233 --> 03:54.942
...of this establishment to me...

03:55.109 --> 03:57.152
...at which time,
you become my employees.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.612
We're your employees?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.155
Yeah. Or...

04:00.323 --> 04:01.698
...close down permanently.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.200
Choice is yours.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.577
Okay. How do l pronounce
your name?

04:05.954 --> 04:07.579
Tchaikovsky?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.039
Chudnofsky.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.791
Char-- Chudofsk--

04:10.959 --> 04:12.251
Chowdofsky?

04:15.797 --> 04:19.423
Chud-nof-sky.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.385
Chudnofsky?

04:21.552 --> 04:24.388
All right.
Chudnofsky, kiss my ass.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.058
Put your lips to my ass...

04:28.226 --> 04:30.394
...and kiss it. French kiss it.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.688
Tickle it with your grey whiskers.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.065
I got bittersweet news for you.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.025
You're washed-up.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.945
You're old. You're boring.
You're not scary.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.863
You dress like shit.

04:42.031 --> 04:45.117
It's over for you, okay?
That's the bitter news.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.910
Now the sweet news is:

04:47.078 --> 04:48.328
You can retire.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.622
You can go play golf...

04:50.873 --> 04:54.209
...eat your dinners at 3:00
in the afternoon...

04:54.627 --> 04:59.089
...play with your grandkids,
drink Metamucil, old people shit.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.508
Okay? Look at me.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.386
I got a name people can say.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.305
My name's Danny Clear.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.348
I deal crystal meth.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.476
People call me Crystal Clear.
It's easy.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.271
Check out my kick-ass
hangout here.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.149
I got shitloads of glass
everywhere.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.692
I got a see-through piano.

05:19.610 --> 05:20.902
Look at my boys.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.904
They're pimped out.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.406
We got Gucci...

05:24.574 --> 05:25.907
...Armani...

05:26.075 --> 05:28.327
...another Gucci, tailor-made.

05:29.620 --> 05:33.123
This is what you need
to get to the top today.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.750
Not hard work.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.210
Not dressing like
Disco Santa Claus.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.129
You need charisma.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.756
You look like my Uncle Greg.

05:41.716 --> 05:45.093
A very nice guy, but, you know,
he's a dentist.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.472
Now consider this
your retirement letter.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.309
It's over.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.853
See your way out.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.068
What, you truly
don't think I'm scary?

06:03.780 --> 06:04.404
No.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.535
Okay, okay, you're scary.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.037
Shit, you're scary.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.246
You just said l'm not.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.831
No, no, you are. You are.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.625
What's a "Disco Santa"?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.794
"A Disco Sa--"? l don't know.

06:18.961 --> 06:19.961
Sorry.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.463
It was just something stupid.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.881
You said I'm boring.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.009
My gun has two barrels.
That's not boring.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.387
And it was very difficult to make.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.181
Answer me!

06:31.349 --> 06:32.432
What?

06:33.768 --> 06:35.894
What could l do
to be more scary?

06:36.521 --> 06:37.396
A better name?

06:37.563 --> 06:38.313
Cooler name?

06:38.481 --> 06:39.731
More colour or something.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.111
Maybe you could say
something to people...

06:44.278 --> 06:45.987
...before you kill them.
But not now.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.949
It's hard to think with this
double-barrel in my face.

06:49.117 --> 06:49.950
Sorry.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.749
You've given me
a lot to think about.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.798
You're not gonna kill me?
Oh, l get it.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.301
You keep me alive
so l can spread your legend.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.888
Okay, l'll do that, man.
I'll spread your legend.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.932
Hey, you forgot your briefcase.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.214
Let's get this party crazy!

08:29.217 --> 08:30.509
Behold, my lady.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.403
That's the good stuff.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.197
Oh, man.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.411
Good morning....

09:41.914 --> 09:42.664
Ana Lee.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.874
Ana Lee. That's what l meant.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.586
Oh, shit.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.967
Son. This what you want
from your life?

09:56.887 --> 09:58.054
This....

09:59.181 --> 10:01.224
This gives you
a sense of fulfilment?

10:02.268 --> 10:04.519
Dad, I told you,
tomorrow l'm enrolling...

10:04.687 --> 10:06.730
...in lTT Technical Institute...

10:06.897 --> 10:09.232
...and l'm gonna fix computers
for a living, so--

10:11.152 --> 10:11.776
I spend...

10:11.944 --> 10:13.653
...all night writing an editorial...

10:13.821 --> 10:16.406
...about the nausea this town
has come to inspire.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.784
About the corruption, the violence
and the decadence...

10:19.952 --> 10:22.704
...that we've come to expect
as part of our daily life.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.874
Then l have to turn the page...

10:26.876 --> 10:29.169
...and see my own son's
contribution...

10:29.337 --> 10:30.962
...to this mayhem.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.800
Sweet! l'm in the paper?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.469
Now, you may think you're...

10:37.637 --> 10:38.678
...humiliating me...

10:38.846 --> 10:40.805
...but you're humiliating yourself.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.808
Sorry. lf you don't like it,
just ask them not to print it.

10:43.976 --> 10:44.976
It's your newspaper.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.437
I can't, because, unfortunately,
it's news.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.897
That's a good point.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.940
I kept myself out of
the papers for years.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.984
Now do me a favour
and do the same.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.319
And l told you...

10:54.862 --> 10:57.405
...stop taking girls
into my garage.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.034
You do it again,
I'll change the lock.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.497
-Okay, but can you sign this for me?
-Yeah.

11:09.001 --> 11:13.088
"Never stop the partay."

11:36.195 --> 11:37.570
Look at these.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.366
My shoe.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.159
-Hello? Hello?
-Hello?

11:43.327 --> 11:45.412
I'm very uncomfortable.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.623
Who is it?

11:49.583 --> 11:51.459
Paparazzi in the house.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.211
Change the channel.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.922
I think we may have our
first visual on Britt Reid.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.800
-Go, go, go! Go! Get in there!
-lt's for me. Hello?

11:58.968 --> 12:00.051
Get in there!

12:02.138 --> 12:04.639
And how are you coping
with your father's death?

12:04.807 --> 12:05.890
Give us some insight!

12:06.976 --> 12:08.309
If you're just joining us...

12:08.477 --> 12:10.979
...James Reid has been found dead
from an allergic...

12:11.147 --> 12:12.731
...reaction to a bee sting...

12:12.898 --> 12:14.774
...leaving his son his media empire.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.318
How are you coping
with your father's death?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.970
It was during my
election campaign...

12:44.138 --> 12:46.848
...for district attorney
that I first met James Reid.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.185
And it was immediately clear to me
that he was a man of...

12:50.352 --> 12:52.145
...infallible integrity.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.149
He dedicated himself to this city
through his philanthropic endeavours...

12:56.317 --> 12:58.526
...and his newspaper,
The Daily Sentinel...

12:58.694 --> 13:00.403
...a shining beacon of truth.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.448
He was our North Star.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.325
He showed us the way.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.536
Thank you, James.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.135
Britt, your father was truly...

13:24.303 --> 13:26.387
...a great man.
When l started campaigning...

13:26.555 --> 13:27.639
...he gave me some--

13:27.807 --> 13:29.724
The best businessman
I've ever known.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.143
-He always came out on top.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.436
Britt?

13:35.731 --> 13:36.397
Britt.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.818
Hey. I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.362
I just wanted to say
that my father...

13:42.530 --> 13:45.657
...was a federal court judge,
so l think l know how it feels.

13:46.325 --> 13:50.036
When he passed away,
I had some pretty big shoes to fill.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.538
Just like you.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.958
So if you ever need
somebody to talk to....

13:55.125 --> 13:59.754
I mean, if you ever just want to grab
a drink, you want to get cheered up...

14:00.548 --> 14:01.714
...l'm around.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.676
Okay, thanks, man.
I really appreciate--

14:04.844 --> 14:06.344
-Lock it up.
-Yeah. Okay.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.429
-Keep it tight.
-Cool.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.943
This is your newspaper...

14:24.154 --> 14:27.031
...but the burden doesn't
have to fall on you alone.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.372
I've been your father's...

14:34.540 --> 14:37.458
...most trusted colleague
for the past 45 years.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.587
I'm gonna make sure
The Daily Sentinel...

14:40.754 --> 14:43.089
...stays on a path that
would make him proud.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.348
So, what do you think
of all this?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.560
I don't think anything, man.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.355
I don't know a thing
about this newspaper.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.483
I've never even read
a full edition of it.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.236
You can do whatever the hell
you want with it.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.739
I'm not the guy to run
The Sentinel.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.545
Trying doesn't matter
when you always fail.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.057
Where's my leaf?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.485
Stupid bush.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.824
Hello!

15:51.992 --> 15:55.328
Who makes my coffee?!

15:55.496 --> 15:58.665
Will someone explain to me why,
on the worst day of my life...

15:59.458 --> 16:01.542
...my coffee tastes like shit?!

16:01.877 --> 16:03.878
Your coffee is normally
made by Kato.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.797
Who the hell is that?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.967
He works on your father's cars
and makes his coffee.

16:09.134 --> 16:12.136
You fired him and everyone who
works for your father yesterday.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.013
I want Kato here now!

16:29.530 --> 16:30.947
You're Kato?

16:31.865 --> 16:34.784
I thought your name was Henry.
I thought the pool guy was Kato.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.285
I'm Kato.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.373
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.334
He was a complex man.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.296
Yeah.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.551
I have two questions for you, Kato.
Then you can go home.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.178
Why is it that my dad's mechanic
makes the coffee?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.848
And why is it that without you,
the coffee tastes...

16:57.016 --> 16:57.807
...like crap?

16:57.975 --> 16:59.767
I think it's easier if l show you.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.938
Holy cow.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.440
Where did you get that thing?

17:05.607 --> 17:06.566
I made it.

17:06.733 --> 17:07.567
Watch this.

17:07.734 --> 17:08.776
You made that?

17:50.986 --> 17:54.322
Sit with me, Kato.
Tell me your tale.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.158
I was born in Shanghai.
You know Shanghai?

17:57.493 --> 17:58.618
Love Japan.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.120
My parents died when l was 4...

18:01.580 --> 18:05.333
...and until l was 12
I lived in an orphanage.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.003
I'm sorry. My mom died
when l was young too.

18:09.171 --> 18:12.173
What happened after that?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.717
Then me and a few friends
ran away.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.011
-Lived on the street.
-How'd you start...

18:17.179 --> 18:19.555
-...working for my dad?
-l work in a garage.

18:19.723 --> 18:23.017
And one day your father came in
with a '65 Chrysler.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.602
I know the car well.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.815
He was so happy with my work
that he offered me a job.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.358
I said yes.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.652
The coffee.
How'd that come about?

18:32.820 --> 18:34.362
He used to always say:

18:34.780 --> 18:37.532
"No one could ever make me
a good cup of coffee."

18:37.699 --> 18:38.699
Good impression.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.993
So l built him the coffee machine.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.872
Well, you make one
damn fine cup of coffee, sir.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.041
Wanna see something cool?

18:47.960 --> 18:48.793
Yeah.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.966
Not bad, man.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.384
-You did that?
-Yep.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.636
Industrial polycarbonate.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.973
What the hell is industrial
polycarbonate?

19:03.559 --> 19:04.350
It's the stuff...

19:04.518 --> 19:06.727
...they use to make shark tanks.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.398
What are you doing?
Put that away. Are you crazy?

19:10.566 --> 19:11.566
Come on.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.192
Don't be a pussy.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.403
Okay.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.072
What are you gonna do?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.661
Dude.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.831
That was awesome. What is that stuff?
How does that wo--?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.583
Whoa, what are you
gonna do now?

19:28.792 --> 19:29.792
And....

19:32.921 --> 19:35.256
That is some Ben-Hurshit, dude.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.007
Yeah.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.510
Your dad made me do this kind
of stuff over the last few years.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.056
That is the balls.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.937
Old man was getting
paranoid, huh?

19:50.105 --> 19:50.855
You like that?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.940
-Yeah.
-Check this out.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.825
You drew all these?

20:03.243 --> 20:04.952
This is awesome.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.537
Kato, you are...

20:06.705 --> 20:07.788
...a really good drawer.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.165
This is really impressive.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.792
Thanks. That's the stuff
I would really like to do.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.127
Holy--!

20:13.378 --> 20:15.046
Kato, are you a pervert?

20:16.131 --> 20:17.840
I wish I could draw stuff that sexy.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.553
Beer?

20:22.721 --> 20:24.805
Yeah, l'd love a beer. Sure.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.611
Thank you.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.079
Hey, Kato?

20:49.456 --> 20:51.332
What did you think of my father?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.625
He was fine.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.836
Come on. Just tell me.

20:56.004 --> 20:59.257
He was my boss.
Nobody loves their boss.

20:59.716 --> 21:02.176
Don't sugar-coat this.
You're not going to offend me.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.970
Just tell me, man to man.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.640
He was a bit of a dick.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.519
Yep.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.357
You are--

21:17.109 --> 21:18.526
Look at that.

21:19.194 --> 21:20.653
I am genius.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.321
-You are a genius.
-Yeah.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.823
You're a mad genius.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.283
I like classical music.

21:26.159 --> 21:29.328
You're a genius who likes classical
music. You know what you are?

21:29.496 --> 21:30.705
A human Swiss Army knife.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.248
What's that mean?

21:32.416 --> 21:34.750
It's a little thing,
you keep pulling out things.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.211
When you think
there couldn't be any more...

21:37.379 --> 21:39.297
...a new cool thing comes out.
That's you.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.715
You even dress like one.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.675
Just need a little plus
on your chest.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.885
-Let's drink more.
-Yeah, let's drink.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.264
Yeah.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.058
You're speaking Chinese.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.185
Oh, shit. Sorry.

21:53.353 --> 21:57.356
I spent three weeks making a new
bumper for his Rolls-Royce.

21:57.524 --> 22:00.693
And the day after l finished,
he crashed it.

22:01.653 --> 22:05.448
He actually said it was my fault.
He screamed at me.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.575
That sounds like him.

22:07.743 --> 22:11.245
Listen to this, here's another story
of the 1 0 million l have.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.914
I'm young, there's a--

22:14.082 --> 22:16.917
Guys are picking on a girl
in school, I try to stop it.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.169
I get in trouble.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.420
What does my dad do?

22:19.588 --> 22:23.674
He takes my favourite toy, and he rips
the head off of it! Right in front of me.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.217
He throws it in the garbage.

22:25.385 --> 22:28.179
I was trying to help!
That's all l was trying to do!

22:28.930 --> 22:30.681
You know, it's unbelievable.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.895
He's an ass his entire life and then,
you know, they build him a statue.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.438
I just don't think....

22:37.606 --> 22:41.859
People are gonna look at it
and think he's great but he's not.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.694
It's totally unfair.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.197
There's no justice.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.285
Well, Kato?

22:52.371 --> 22:55.623
What do you say we get ourselves
some goddamn justice, huh?

22:56.083 --> 22:57.083
You serious?

22:57.250 --> 22:58.292
I'm totally serious.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.045
Let's do something crazy, man.
Let's do something nuts!

23:01.505 --> 23:02.755
Let's just do it.

23:02.923 --> 23:03.756
Yeah!

23:13.100 --> 23:14.308
Let's roll, Kato.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.158
Do you think it makes me
happy to do this, Dad?

23:44.464 --> 23:45.756
Come here.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.429
I know what you mean.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.351
Oh, this looks ominous.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.021
Where you going, man?

24:11.491 --> 24:13.784
Oh, shit. Oh, no.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.791
What do I do? What do l do?

24:21.293 --> 24:22.543
Oh, God.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.838
Hey! Leave them alone!

24:26.715 --> 24:27.882
Let's get him!

24:28.049 --> 24:28.883
Oh, shit!

24:29.050 --> 24:30.301
I made a mistake!

24:35.724 --> 24:36.891
Shit.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.853
Guys, seriously! That's messed up!

24:41.021 --> 24:41.812
Seriously!

24:47.319 --> 24:48.360
No!

24:48.528 --> 24:50.404
Okay. Okay. No.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.198
I'm gonna give him a root canal.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.199
Just cut him.

24:53.366 --> 24:55.367
Get off, man! That's enough!

24:56.328 --> 24:57.369
Open wi--

25:00.373 --> 25:02.249
-You're a dead man!
-Come on, let's go!

25:42.958 --> 25:44.708
Britt! Behind you!

25:51.883 --> 25:53.175
Eat shit!

25:56.972 --> 25:58.472
Kato, wait up!

26:01.268 --> 26:02.643
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.479
Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Wait!

26:07.399 --> 26:09.692
-Go, go, go.
-l'm in! l'm in! l'm in!

26:11.319 --> 26:14.613
Oh, God! That was crazy!
I can't believe that!

26:14.781 --> 26:17.658
Holy shit! Oh, my God, Kato.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.126
Shit. Pigs.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.919
Oh, no. Oh, no.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.588
Are you a good driver?

26:30.922 --> 26:31.964
You kidding me?

26:32.132 --> 26:34.174
When I was a kid,
me and some friends--

26:34.342 --> 26:35.676
Kato, not now. Just drive.

26:35.844 --> 26:36.885
Okay, okay.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.183
Just act cool.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.519
-What do I do?
-Just act casual.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.729
Pull it over! Now!

26:48.315 --> 26:49.273
What are you doing?

26:49.441 --> 26:50.608
I'm trying to lose him.

26:50.775 --> 26:51.400
I don't know!

26:51.568 --> 26:53.485
Man, now we're in a car chase!

26:54.529 --> 26:55.738
Here he comes!

26:59.868 --> 27:00.909
Show me your hands!

27:08.835 --> 27:09.960
He's trying to kill us!

27:10.337 --> 27:11.545
Do the Ben-Hurshit!

27:13.256 --> 27:14.048
The Ben-Hurshit!

27:25.977 --> 27:26.560
Oh, no.

27:35.737 --> 27:36.737
Damn it.

27:38.782 --> 27:39.573
Kato...

27:40.909 --> 27:43.827
...l think this is the greatest
moment of my entire life.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.871
I know. Mine too.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.338
Yeah! We rule!

27:56.174 --> 27:57.800
That was amazing!

28:05.725 --> 28:07.559
We are awesome!

28:07.727 --> 28:08.727
That was crazy!

28:08.895 --> 28:11.814
How do you do that, dude?
You beat the crap out of those guys!

28:12.107 --> 28:14.441
Where l grew up,
it was very dangerous.

28:14.609 --> 28:17.403
I got in a lot of fights
when l was a kid.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.863
But you knew where people
were without looking.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.115
You were so fast.

28:21.282 --> 28:25.452
When my heart starts pumping,
it's almost like time slows down.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.705
It's unbelievable how cool we are!

28:27.872 --> 28:30.207
Do you hear me, Dad? We did it!

28:30.375 --> 28:31.792
That was amazing!

28:31.960 --> 28:33.377
Kato, I'm serious.

28:35.463 --> 28:38.632
I'm gonna get real with you,
so just go with this.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.301
It might get weird and intimate...

28:41.469 --> 28:42.886
...but just accept me, okay?

28:43.054 --> 28:47.558
What we did tonight was fantastic.
It was amazing.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.478
We saved those people, man.
We saved their lives!

28:51.646 --> 28:54.606
So here's what I'm saying.
We keep doing this.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.900
You can beat the crap
out of a million dudes...

28:57.068 --> 28:59.778
...because you freeze time
when your heart starts pumping.

28:59.946 --> 29:02.114
We do that every night,
I'm saying!

29:02.282 --> 29:03.907
Kato? Kato?

29:06.161 --> 29:09.788
We could be heroes

29:09.956 --> 29:10.748
Hey, hey, hey.

29:10.915 --> 29:11.832
Look, look.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.251
We're on television!

29:15.253 --> 29:16.587
We're on TV.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.840
Look at me!

29:20.008 --> 29:21.175
Where am l?

29:21.384 --> 29:22.634
I don't know.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.846
I'm too fast for TV.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.514
Yes, exactly.

29:30.351 --> 29:33.353
We saved those people and they
just talk about that stupid head.

29:33.521 --> 29:36.690
How can we be heroes
if they think we're criminals?

29:36.858 --> 29:39.526
The suspects are considered
armed and dangerous.

29:39.694 --> 29:43.280
I am coming to you live from
Elysian Fields Cemetery....

29:44.032 --> 29:45.032
Okay.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.534
Think about this, Kato.

29:47.994 --> 29:52.790
What is the one insanely stupid thing
every superhero has in common?

29:53.958 --> 29:54.958
Tights?

29:55.293 --> 29:56.168
No.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.169
Cape?

29:57.462 --> 29:58.545
No, Kato.

29:58.713 --> 30:03.634
It's that everyone knows that they're
the good guy, the hero, you know?

30:03.802 --> 30:06.720
All the bad guy has to do is
start capping innocent people...

30:06.888 --> 30:09.389
...and he's got the good guy
by the nuts.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.642
It's in every movie,
it's in every comic book.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.894
It's in everything. lt's so stupid.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.562
But if the bad guy...

30:15.730 --> 30:19.733
...thought the good guy was also a bad
guy, he wouldn't be able to do that.

30:19.901 --> 30:22.361
That's what we'll do differently.
We will...

30:22.529 --> 30:23.654
...pose as villains...

30:23.822 --> 30:25.489
...but we'll act like heroes.

30:26.074 --> 30:29.868
But then the police and the bad guys
will both try to kill us.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.162
We're dead already, Kato.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.082
I mean, seriously, look at us.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.960
We've both been completely
wasting our potential.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.920
You a little bit more than me.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.589
What do you want your
autobiography to be called?

30:42.841 --> 30:45.676
Oil Changes and Cappuccinos?

30:45.844 --> 30:51.098
Because I think Balls Deep
in Shit-Kicking Dudes by Kato...

30:51.266 --> 30:53.350
...is a much cooler-sounding book.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.936
I would read that book,
and l don't read shit.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.606
But when they adapted it into a movie,
I would see the shit out of it.

30:59.774 --> 31:02.442
Kato, you should never make
coffee for anyone again.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.944
It's a waste of your talent.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.572
It's not dying that
you need to be afraid of.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.449
It's never having lived
in the first place.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.914
It did feel good
saving those people.

31:16.082 --> 31:18.292
Well, technically, l saved them,
but you helped.

31:18.459 --> 31:19.126
Whatever.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.753
-Let's not get technical.
-But why would people...

31:21.921 --> 31:24.798
...take us serious? We're just
two guys who stole a head.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.640
I know how to make them
take us seriously.

31:41.482 --> 31:44.443
All right, gentlemen. Hear ye, hear ye.
Court is in session.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.653
Let's talk shop, okay?

31:46.821 --> 31:47.905
Shall we?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.824
Who's this guy?

31:51.284 --> 31:52.618
Who's your friend?

31:52.785 --> 31:54.912
-He's my man.
-l'm not your man.

31:55.079 --> 31:58.332
He's not my man.
No. He's not my man.

31:58.541 --> 32:01.168
He's like, you know, he's like
"my man." He's my--

32:01.628 --> 32:03.337
Not-- We're plato-- lt's plato--

32:03.504 --> 32:05.631
We're platonic friends.
Platonic male friends.

32:06.174 --> 32:06.924
He's my...

32:07.091 --> 32:09.134
...executive associate.

32:09.844 --> 32:12.846
Yes. That's who he is,
and that doesn't matter.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.515
What does matter
is how we tackle...

32:15.683 --> 32:17.142
...this horrible incident.

32:17.310 --> 32:20.812
Whoever did this means business,
and this is just the beginning.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.274
What are you talking about?
You mean the vandalising business?

32:24.442 --> 32:25.609
I get it.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.612
Listen, let's not blow this thing
out of proportion.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.156
I will blow this guy
in any proportion l like.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.199
This is my...

32:32.367 --> 32:35.702
...newspaper, Axford, and l want
this man on the front page of it.

32:35.870 --> 32:39.373
I want him on the webpage.
I want you to blog about him.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.875
I want him on every
news outlet we have.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.502
I want the whole city to know...

32:43.670 --> 32:45.379
...how dangerous this man is.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.297
The man that cut the head off...

32:47.465 --> 32:50.175
...of my father's statue. Not yours.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.636
All right.

32:53.137 --> 32:56.598
Since there isn't any real info
on the guy's identity...

32:58.226 --> 32:59.559
...what do we call him?

33:10.697 --> 33:11.989
That's easy.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.615
I got it.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.411
This man is called...

33:17.745 --> 33:19.913
...the Green Bee.

33:25.503 --> 33:26.503
It's kind of lame.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.213
It sounds like a knitting store.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.132
It sounds like an energy bar.

33:30.341 --> 33:33.593
No, that came out wrong. That's not
what I meant. I didn't mean that!

33:33.761 --> 33:35.554
I like The Decapitator.

33:35.722 --> 33:38.306
Well, then make it like
the Green Desecrater.

33:38.474 --> 33:40.183
What's the guy
that drives the horse?

33:40.351 --> 33:41.518
Or Green Trenchcoat Guy.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.894
The Green Hornet.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.271
No. It's more like--

33:44.439 --> 33:45.772
-What?
-What did--?

33:45.940 --> 33:47.441
The Green Hornet.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.444
That's pretty awesome.

33:50.611 --> 33:51.611
Much better.

33:51.779 --> 33:54.072
-You guys like that?
-Yeah, your man's right.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.949
-Green Hornet it is.
-Looks good too.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.036
-The Green Hornet. Yeah.
-Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.746
It's decided, then.

34:00.913 --> 34:02.789
The front page of
tomorrow's newspaper...

34:02.957 --> 34:06.293
...will feature the Green Hornet.
Unless you like Green Bee better?

34:06.461 --> 34:07.294
Anyone? No one?

34:07.462 --> 34:08.587
Oh, that's much worse.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.297
-Definitely Hornet.
-Okay, fine.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.215
Let's roll, Kato.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.803
So Green Hornet des-- Oh, no, not
"desecrates." How about decapitates?

34:16.971 --> 34:18.472
It's gonna be a long night.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.156
I am.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.786
We need to think of
a cool name for you.

34:41.954 --> 34:42.996
The Lil' Stinger!

34:43.164 --> 34:45.040
I'm the Green Hornet,
you're Lil' Stinger!

34:45.208 --> 34:46.248
No way.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.502
The Honey Pot.

34:48.710 --> 34:51.254
Get it? Like, bees make honey?
You're my Honey Pot.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.341
What's going on?

34:58.179 --> 35:02.099
Decapitated statues.
I decapitated real people.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.184
No, no. I wouldn't worry about it.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.603
He won't affect business.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.314
I'm not worried.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.025
Who told you l'm worried?

35:12.318 --> 35:13.318
DA Scanlon!

35:13.486 --> 35:16.530
With the nightclub bombing,
and now this Green Hornet guy...

35:16.697 --> 35:19.366
...some saying the streets
might not be as safe as you say.

35:19.534 --> 35:23.370
Look, guys, stop connecting separate
thoughts with invisible lines.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.123
This Green Hornet thing
is just a prank.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.084
What you guys should report
is that since I took office...

35:29.252 --> 35:32.379
...crime is down significantly
in the city of Los Angeles.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.713
Thank you.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.994
-Hi.
-Hi.

36:04.370 --> 36:05.662
I'm Lenore Case.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.999
I'm the temp for Mr. Reid's
secretarial position.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.542
Today's my first day.

36:10.918 --> 36:14.337
Oh, nice to meet you. I'm Kato.

36:14.505 --> 36:15.839
It's my first day too.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.175
Really? Well, nice to meet you.

36:18.342 --> 36:19.718
Do you work for Mr. Reid?

36:20.094 --> 36:22.095
I'm his executive associate.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.097
That must be great.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.933
Yeah, it is. So far.

36:28.227 --> 36:30.061
I have a really important question.

36:30.229 --> 36:34.274
Who is the hottie-boom-bottie who's
standing right behind me right now?

36:34.442 --> 36:37.235
I'm kidding. Hi, I'm Britt Reid.
I own this newspaper.

36:37.403 --> 36:40.238
-What's going on?
-lt's such a pleasure. I'm Lenore Case.

36:40.406 --> 36:43.283
I've been sent to be your temp
until you find a new secretary.

36:46.329 --> 36:47.120
Jackpot.

36:47.538 --> 36:48.788
Right this way.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.207
So...

36:51.292 --> 36:52.125
...got one.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.460
Why don't you tell me:

36:53.628 --> 36:57.297
How do you feel about
the state of this...

36:57.465 --> 36:58.715
...newspaper...

36:58.883 --> 37:00.926
...as it stands today.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.302
Go.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.138
To be honest,
this paper has taken a dip...

37:05.306 --> 37:07.599
...in the last few years
in quality and ambition.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.558
Really?

37:08.893 --> 37:10.393
Well, the entire industry has...

37:10.561 --> 37:12.145
...because of the lnternet.

37:12.313 --> 37:15.649
So there's a lot of pressure to print
easy-to-digest articles.

37:15.816 --> 37:16.775
And it's the last...

37:16.943 --> 37:20.028
...family-owned paper in the city,
one of the only not attached...

37:20.196 --> 37:22.656
...to a conglomerate,
so it's understandable.

37:22.823 --> 37:23.615
Conglomerate?

37:23.783 --> 37:26.159
The Sentinel used to really
use its independence...

37:26.327 --> 37:27.953
...to be brazen, at the very least.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.830
Like that article your father wrote
just after the bombing?

37:30.998 --> 37:34.501
That was reporting. That is the kind
of article that can make a difference.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.838
That was good. You know
a lot about this shit, huh?

37:39.006 --> 37:42.008
I studied journalism.
I have a minor in criminology.

37:42.176 --> 37:43.677
-Really?
-Yeah.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.638
Criminology.
The study of the criminal mind.

37:46.806 --> 37:47.847
What are your...

37:48.015 --> 37:50.976
...thoughts on this
Green Hornet character? Go.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.646
Well, first, there's two kinds
of criminals.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.273
There's the psycho egomaniac...

37:56.440 --> 37:57.691
...and the power maniac.

37:57.858 --> 37:59.276
He seems to be the second.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.902
-English.
-He defied authority--

38:01.070 --> 38:02.362
What will he do next?

38:03.114 --> 38:04.114
Yeah.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.950
What is his next move,
is what I was gonna ask.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.493
Write this down.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.037
Well, he'll probably try to...

38:11.205 --> 38:12.372
...appropriate more power.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.708
He'll hit somebody
on their own turf.

38:14.875 --> 38:18.378
Basically, he'll start out small, and
then he'll work his way up to the top.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.381
I mean, that's what John Gotti did
to Paul Castellano in '85.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.383
-And it worked?
-Yes.

38:24.885 --> 38:25.719
Look at you!

38:25.886 --> 38:27.804
You really know a lot
about this stuff.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.806
And you're lovely
and beautiful and--

38:29.974 --> 38:33.977
I'm just sitting here thinking, "Why
are you only pursuing this in your...?"

38:35.438 --> 38:37.230
Kato, help me out here.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.565
Twilight?

38:40.359 --> 38:42.527
"Twilight"?

38:42.695 --> 38:43.570
Yeah.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.573
I saw the movie,
but I don't see how this is--

38:46.741 --> 38:49.576
Oh, no, no, no. Not like that.
No. Not like the movie.

38:49.744 --> 38:53.788
I guess if we're doing movies,
it would be more like Cocoon...

38:53.956 --> 38:55.915
...or something like that.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.335
Yeah. Later in one's years.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.086
What are you--? l'm only 36.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.338
You're 36?

39:01.505 --> 39:02.922
Holy shit. That's crazy.

39:03.090 --> 39:04.841
Thought you were, like, 31 , tops.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.135
I don't even know if we
can hire a 36-year-old.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.428
We have to build a ramp.

39:10.056 --> 39:10.597
Why now?

39:10.765 --> 39:12.098
She doesn't wanna tell you.

39:12.266 --> 39:14.184
You don't know what
you're talking about.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.435
Mr. Kato is right.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.270
I do not feel comfortable.

39:17.480 --> 39:21.441
And if this means l am not going to be
your temp any longer, I'm sorry. lt's--

39:21.609 --> 39:23.234
That's exactly what it means.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.446
-Yeah.
-Okay, thank you.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.699
Because you are now
my permanent secretary!

39:30.117 --> 39:32.410
Here is what has
gone down, Lenore.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.954
You've displayed two things.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.122
Balls.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.875
And if there's one thing
I like on my women...

39:39.627 --> 39:40.960
...it's balls.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.295
Be my permanent secretary.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.463
Are you kidding me?

39:43.631 --> 39:45.298
I'm not kidding. This is how l do.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.425
This is how l roll,
every day, all day.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.636
I make it rain like this, okay?

39:49.804 --> 39:51.054
Come work for me.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.473
-Just say yes. Don't think.
-Really?

39:53.641 --> 39:55.225
-l'll do it. Yes!
-Thank you. Yes!

39:55.393 --> 39:57.143
-This is so exciting.
-lt is exciting.

39:57.311 --> 39:59.062
-Thank you so much.
-Don't thank him.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.397
-Thank you.
-Yes.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.982
-l will not disappoint you.
-l don't think you will.

40:03.150 --> 40:06.236
I will do in-depth research,
fact checking, spell checking.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.487
Anything that you need.

40:07.655 --> 40:11.241
Why don't you get started on more
Green Hornet research? Perfect.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.161
She is hot. lt's crazy how
hot she is. lt's sickening.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.913
Did you write down everything?

40:17.081 --> 40:18.123
Let me see!

40:19.291 --> 40:20.125
Pervert.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.836
Let's get to work, Kato.

40:24.004 --> 40:26.423
All right, we got a plan.
Start small...

40:26.590 --> 40:28.591
-...work our way up to the top.
-Okay.

40:29.635 --> 40:30.677
We'll need a car.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.011
Yes, we'll need a car.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.304
With some weapons.

40:34.181 --> 40:35.098
And armour.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.850
Cool rims. Spinning rims.

40:37.017 --> 40:38.017
Slurpee machine.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.769
A horn that plays "La Cucaracha."

40:39.937 --> 40:41.688
Loaded up the ass with cool shit!

40:41.856 --> 40:43.022
I can do that.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.024
Kato, I want you to take my hand...

40:45.192 --> 40:47.318
...and come with me
on this adventure.

40:47.486 --> 40:50.447
I'll go with you,
but I don't wanna touch you.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.700
Don't take my hand, but will you
come with me on this adventure?

41:15.723 --> 41:16.639
No.

41:27.234 --> 41:29.486
I'll pick this one.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.322
All right. This one.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.492
Tell me what's going down, girl.

41:40.414 --> 41:41.080
Hey, Kato!

41:41.415 --> 41:42.499
Come closer.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.375
I had an idea for the car.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.586
Ejector seats.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.087
Ejector seats?

41:48.255 --> 41:50.048
You don't think it's a good idea?

41:52.760 --> 41:54.093
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:31.423 --> 42:33.424
I'm so excited right now.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.468
I can't wait!

42:39.890 --> 42:41.641
Oh, man. What the hell?

42:41.809 --> 42:43.184
Watch your feet.

42:43.644 --> 42:46.062
I call it the Black Beauty.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.064
Kato!

42:48.983 --> 42:50.400
It's beautiful!

42:51.694 --> 42:53.319
And it's black.

42:55.322 --> 42:56.698
Incredible.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.833
Dude, we're forgetting
something important.

43:08.752 --> 43:09.752
Watch this.

43:14.466 --> 43:16.217
That is so wicked.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.001
Where we going?

43:50.169 --> 43:52.045
I have no idea. I thought you knew.

43:52.212 --> 43:54.797
Oh, okay, l got an idea. Okay.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.510
Mr. Reid's office.

43:59.678 --> 44:01.387
I'm looking at you.

44:01.555 --> 44:02.221
What?

44:02.389 --> 44:03.389
I'm totally joking.

44:03.557 --> 44:05.058
Britt Reid calling.

44:05.267 --> 44:07.894
Burning the candle at both ends,
I see.

44:08.062 --> 44:11.731
Wouldn't Mr. Case
be upset with that?

44:12.274 --> 44:14.484
There is no Mr. Case?

44:14.652 --> 44:16.402
Well, that's not why l'm calling.

44:16.570 --> 44:20.073
Remember we asked you to do
all that Green Hornet research?

44:20.282 --> 44:21.866
Predicting what he might do next?

44:22.034 --> 44:24.077
If you could send us that?
Those crime maps.

44:24.286 --> 44:26.245
-Oh, yeah.
-That'd be helpful. Fax it over.

44:26.413 --> 44:27.413
Hold on a second.

44:27.581 --> 44:29.374
Let me see.
It's coming right at you.

44:30.084 --> 44:30.667
Great.

44:30.834 --> 44:32.418
So, what you doing? Just--?

44:32.586 --> 44:34.504
If you need anything else,
let me know.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.214
-I'll talk to you soon.
-Bye-bye.

44:38.425 --> 44:39.676
She wants me so bad...

44:39.843 --> 44:40.593
...it's crazy.

44:45.057 --> 44:46.057
Here we go.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.100
South Central.

44:47.309 --> 44:48.768
Yeah. Okay. We got...

44:48.936 --> 44:50.269
...14 homicides...

44:50.437 --> 44:53.398
...34 assaults, 1 1 6 drug arrests.

44:53.565 --> 44:54.732
This month.

44:55.067 --> 44:57.527
A good place for
the Green Hornet to make his debut.

44:58.612 --> 45:00.113
-Let's roll, Kato.
-Let's roll.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.285
This is really far east.

45:06.453 --> 45:08.413
I've never been to this part of town.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.125
I think we're in the hood, Kato.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.878
Britt, Britt! Do you think...

45:16.046 --> 45:17.088
...we start with them?

45:17.256 --> 45:18.881
Yeah. Just like Lenore said.

45:19.049 --> 45:21.134
Start small, work our way up.

45:21.301 --> 45:22.969
This is really, really intense.

45:23.137 --> 45:24.595
-You don't want to do it?
-l do.

45:24.763 --> 45:26.764
Let's do it before
we chicken out, okay?

45:26.932 --> 45:28.975
-l won't chicken out.
-Who knows who might?

45:29.143 --> 45:30.143
Just pull up to them.

45:30.352 --> 45:31.310
I don't want to talk.

45:31.478 --> 45:34.063
-Well, l don't want to talk either.
-So get in the back!

45:34.481 --> 45:37.150
-l barely speak English.
-You're speaking English now!

45:37.317 --> 45:39.902
Okay, fine! Oh, this is so stupid.

45:40.070 --> 45:41.070
Okay.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.406
-Calm down.
-l am calm. This is scary.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.658
-Shut up.
-You shut up. Just let me talk.

45:45.868 --> 45:47.660
-Be cool, be cool.
-l am cool. Shut up.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.998
Yo, you looking for
that good stuff, man?

45:53.292 --> 45:54.917
I am the Green Hornet.

45:55.085 --> 45:57.170
And l would like to sit
down with your boss.

45:57.337 --> 45:58.337
Sit on this, bitch.

46:02.009 --> 46:02.925
Oh, God!

46:04.011 --> 46:04.886
My arm!

46:14.813 --> 46:16.898
Bean bags! Kato, hit them
with the bean bags!

46:21.153 --> 46:23.488
Yeah!

46:23.697 --> 46:25.031
Let me show you
how it's done!

46:26.825 --> 46:27.492
Green...

46:27.659 --> 46:28.701
...Hornet...

46:28.869 --> 46:29.911
...says hello!

46:52.935 --> 46:54.227
Eat my foot...

46:54.394 --> 46:55.561
...bitch!

46:56.814 --> 46:57.897
My nuts!

47:06.031 --> 47:07.240
What the hell was that?

47:10.327 --> 47:11.994
Who do you work fo--?

47:12.162 --> 47:13.538
Oh, God. Gross.

47:16.166 --> 47:17.583
Who do you work for?

47:17.751 --> 47:19.919
Shit. Hey! You!

47:20.087 --> 47:21.420
Come here! Come here!

47:21.588 --> 47:22.880
Hey! Who do you work for?

47:23.048 --> 47:23.756
Chudnofsky.

47:23.924 --> 47:25.216
Guy everybody works for.

47:25.384 --> 47:26.050
Chov-what-sky?

47:26.218 --> 47:27.176
Chudnofsky.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.012
What kind of a dumb name is that?

47:30.180 --> 47:32.765
-Where do you get the shit you sell?
-l won't tell you.

47:33.058 --> 47:34.433
Oh, really? Never?

47:37.145 --> 47:38.855
Chudnofsky's on our ass, guys.

47:39.022 --> 47:40.773
We gotta get this shipment done.

47:48.448 --> 47:50.616
You've just been stung!

47:50.784 --> 47:51.993
Yeah!

47:52.160 --> 47:52.994
You!

47:53.412 --> 47:55.288
This is my town now!

47:55.455 --> 47:57.790
My name is the Green Hornet.

47:58.166 --> 48:00.126
Cool, man. Nice to meet you.

48:00.294 --> 48:02.044
Cool. How's it going?

48:02.546 --> 48:04.380
Anyway, tell your boss...

48:04.548 --> 48:07.675
...the Green Hornet
sends his regards.

48:07.843 --> 48:08.676
Dude.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.889
You broke my lab, man.

48:13.056 --> 48:13.723
Yeah.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.516
I'm sorry about that.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.730
Let's burn this mother down, Kato.

48:38.540 --> 48:40.374
Explain yourself, Mr. Tupper.

48:41.293 --> 48:45.004
The guy was crazy, man. I mean,
he drove a car through a wall.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.131
The thing looked like a half-tank.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.050
There was fire
coming out of the thing.

48:49.384 --> 48:50.509
And?

48:51.386 --> 48:52.762
Oh, yeah, he gave me this.

48:54.848 --> 48:57.016
He said that this is his town now.

48:59.019 --> 49:02.355
A man comes in in an insect
costume and you shit your pants?

49:02.522 --> 49:04.523
Look, trust me!

49:04.691 --> 49:07.234
A grown man wearing a mask...

49:07.402 --> 49:10.029
...is a little bit scarier
than a guy wearing a suit.

49:16.536 --> 49:21.082
You're not pleased with my suit?
Does it fail to fill you with fear?

49:23.085 --> 49:26.462
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
any disrespect.

49:26.630 --> 49:29.924
Do you have any idea how many great
people have killed in a suit?!

49:32.427 --> 49:33.552
I like your suit.

49:33.720 --> 49:34.720
Me too.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.931
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

49:37.099 --> 49:40.893
I'm not as scary as some idiot
in a green mask. Come on!

49:42.062 --> 49:43.771
You say they won't affect business.

49:43.939 --> 49:45.398
Now, this guy ran six...

49:45.565 --> 49:47.441
...of the biggest meth labs in L.A.

49:47.609 --> 49:49.443
Now because of that Hornet,
he's dead.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.154
Business affected.

49:52.322 --> 49:55.241
I've got reports of the Green Hornet
shooting out a camera....

49:55.409 --> 49:57.827
I had a report that
an elderly couple claims...

49:57.995 --> 49:59.954
...he gave the finger
from the HOV Lane.

50:00.122 --> 50:03.165
--that saw the Green Hornet
and his chauffeur in a fistfight...

50:03.333 --> 50:05.751
...with gang members
in South Central.

50:05.919 --> 50:08.546
The Green Hornet raises questions.
We all know that...

50:08.714 --> 50:10.965
...gang proliferation
has been rising.

50:11.133 --> 50:12.675
Okay, that'll be homework.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.135
I got a yoga class.

50:14.302 --> 50:18.264
Don't worry. Anyhoo, bottom line:
Headlines, people.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.766
Get this story out there.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.811
Will the violence continue
to spill out onto the street?

50:23.979 --> 50:26.105
What are the police
doing about it?

50:26.273 --> 50:28.357
Is anyone safe...

50:28.525 --> 50:29.859
...at the mercy of...

50:30.068 --> 50:31.444
...dot, dot, dot...

50:31.611 --> 50:32.611
...the Green Hornet?

50:32.779 --> 50:35.322
And l want those dots.
I want dots in the paper, okay?

50:35.490 --> 50:36.949
Want us to handle this delicately?

50:37.451 --> 50:38.576
No.

50:38.952 --> 50:42.413
But DA Scanlon's re-election platform
is based on cleaning up the streets.

50:42.581 --> 50:44.040
You guys are acquaintances.

50:44.207 --> 50:46.542
-So if you want us to--
-That's a great idea.

50:46.710 --> 50:47.668
You should use that.

50:47.836 --> 50:49.295
Write an article about that!

50:49.463 --> 50:53.174
"Even DA Scanlon is quivering
at the feet of this scourge."

50:53.341 --> 50:54.717
Use the word "scourge."

50:54.885 --> 50:56.635
-Write an article about that.
-Britt.

50:56.803 --> 50:58.637
-Can l talk to you?
-Yeah, yeah.

50:58.805 --> 51:02.683
I know what you're trying to do, turn
this newspaper into a discotheque.

51:02.851 --> 51:03.976
But it's not gonna work.

51:04.144 --> 51:06.312
That's not what l'm doing.
She's a brainy broad.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.022
This is a serious matter, okay?

51:08.190 --> 51:10.191
Every line we print,
there's repercussions.

51:10.358 --> 51:12.693
Somebody has to take
responsibility. That's me.

51:12.861 --> 51:15.988
Well, l'm not afraid of these bastards
and you shouldn't be either.

51:16.907 --> 51:17.907
Neither was Daniel.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.325
He made it to the wall.

51:19.493 --> 51:22.244
They killed him for wantonly
speculating on the drug war.

51:22.412 --> 51:25.831
That's exactly what you and your
little girlfriend are doing.

51:25.999 --> 51:28.334
I know you think my experience
ain't worth shit...

51:28.502 --> 51:30.753
...but your father listened to me.
So should you.

51:31.171 --> 51:33.089
This is the story l want to run.

51:33.256 --> 51:37.051
I'm going with it,
and if he were still with us, it's what...

51:37.886 --> 51:41.263
...Daniel Vertell.... Vertellah?

51:43.266 --> 51:46.060
Vertalot. lt's what he would've
wanted too. Okay?

51:46.561 --> 51:49.271
That's the story, team. Run it!

51:50.065 --> 51:51.398
Britt Reid outro.

52:07.541 --> 52:08.541
"Scourge"?

52:14.256 --> 52:16.257
--tail on this Hornet guy!

52:42.117 --> 52:43.200
Yeah!

52:43.577 --> 52:44.577
Red light. Stop!

52:44.995 --> 52:46.078
Shit, the camera got us.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.252
What camera?

52:56.423 --> 52:58.549
The Green Hornet
and his masked accomplice...

52:58.717 --> 53:00.843
...stirred up trouble in
the southland today.

53:01.011 --> 53:03.304
Violence has erupted downtown....

53:06.057 --> 53:08.601
-Kato? Breakfast in the house.
-Yes.

53:08.768 --> 53:10.311
I just checked the Hornet mail.

53:10.478 --> 53:12.813
Nothing new,
but they'll be a-knocking.

53:12.981 --> 53:14.440
-Sounds great.
-Yeah.

53:15.650 --> 53:18.819
-l have something for you.
-Really? Awesome.

53:22.490 --> 53:26.118
"Dear Britt, you are my shon-di."

53:26.286 --> 53:27.119
What's shon-di?

53:27.287 --> 53:28.287
Brother.

53:29.122 --> 53:30.623
That's awfully nice.

53:32.125 --> 53:34.501
I've never had a brother, man.
I always wanted one.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.550
What the hell is this?

53:41.760 --> 53:44.511
It's a gas gun. Your Hornet gun!

53:44.679 --> 53:46.055
-A gas gun?
-Yeah.

53:46.264 --> 53:48.349
Why not a "gun" gun?

53:48.516 --> 53:49.975
Our enemies have "gun" guns.

53:50.143 --> 53:52.311
What? l don't understand.
What are these?

53:52.479 --> 53:54.980
What is this? What are these?
Are these paint balls?

53:55.148 --> 53:57.149
No. Inside is knockout gas.

53:57.317 --> 53:58.651
That's insane.

53:58.818 --> 54:00.486
Where's yours? Do you have one?

54:00.654 --> 54:03.155
-Do you have a black version of it?
-No, just you.

54:03.323 --> 54:05.157
-No?
-No.

54:05.325 --> 54:06.825
Well, why not? Why just me?

54:06.993 --> 54:09.328
You are so special.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.872
I know, but how come
I'm the only one with a gun?

54:12.040 --> 54:12.915
You don't have...

54:13.083 --> 54:15.876
...much fighting experience,
so l thought you needed a gun.

54:16.378 --> 54:19.546
Well, l'll be honest,
that's a little insulting, man.

54:19.714 --> 54:21.548
We were both badasses
the other night.

54:21.716 --> 54:24.677
I kicked that guy in the face
like three times. ln the face.

54:24.844 --> 54:26.095
Yeah, yeah, l remember.

54:26.304 --> 54:27.513
Yeah.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.056
It makes you look cool.

54:29.224 --> 54:31.183
I need to look cool now?
What the hell?

54:31.351 --> 54:32.685
You said my outfit was pimp.

54:32.852 --> 54:35.854
I thought, "That's a weird word."
But you said it was pimp.

54:36.022 --> 54:37.356
-lt is pimp.
-Yeah.

54:37.524 --> 54:39.525
The Hornet gun
is just an accessory.

54:39.693 --> 54:40.693
-An accessory?
-Yeah.

54:40.860 --> 54:43.904
Well, then you need
nunchucks, then.

54:44.364 --> 54:47.116
-lf you don't like it, don't use it.
-How does it work?

54:47.909 --> 54:48.534
Shit!

54:49.202 --> 54:50.369
Hey.

54:50.537 --> 54:52.204
Hey, hey, hey.

54:52.372 --> 54:54.373
Okay. lt works.

55:04.050 --> 55:05.050
What the hell?

55:05.635 --> 55:08.304
Kato!

55:08.471 --> 55:09.471
I'm here!

55:12.058 --> 55:13.559
Hey, you're awake.

55:13.727 --> 55:17.062
What the hell? What happened to me?
What's happening? What happened?

55:17.230 --> 55:19.898
You shot yourself in the face
by mistake.

55:20.900 --> 55:23.068
How long was I out?
What time is it?

55:23.236 --> 55:24.486
Two o'clock.

55:24.946 --> 55:26.488
Oh, that's not so bad, l guess.

55:27.407 --> 55:28.741
On Thursday.

55:29.075 --> 55:31.910
It's Thursday? Are you ki--?
It's not Monday right now?

55:32.078 --> 55:33.120
No. I'm sorry.

55:40.795 --> 55:42.296
Did you put this diaper on me?

55:47.635 --> 55:48.927
Well, what did l miss?

55:49.095 --> 55:50.095
Nothing really.

55:50.263 --> 55:52.556
I did some work on
the Black Beauties.

55:52.724 --> 55:53.766
"Beauties"?

55:54.934 --> 55:56.435
Holy crap.

55:56.686 --> 55:58.187
Backups.

55:58.438 --> 56:00.689
How the hell did you do this
in four days?

56:00.899 --> 56:02.399
It's been 1 1 days.

56:04.652 --> 56:07.863
Whoa, 1 1 days? What?!
Are you kidding me?

56:08.031 --> 56:10.616
I wasn't sleeping,
I was in a coma, dick!

56:10.784 --> 56:13.118
But it's okay now,
I fixed the Hornet gas.

56:13.286 --> 56:15.496
The gas only lasts one hour.

56:15.663 --> 56:16.789
Can l see it?

56:16.956 --> 56:18.791
Okay, but be careful
this time. Okay?

56:18.958 --> 56:21.919
I just want to look at it.
Just give it to me for one second....

56:26.341 --> 56:27.341
See you in an hour.

56:27.509 --> 56:28.675
Mr. Reid!

56:28.843 --> 56:29.802
Hey.

56:29.969 --> 56:32.513
Welcome back. l'm so glad
you're feeling better.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.515
I heard that mono was the worst.

56:34.682 --> 56:35.808
Mono?

56:37.811 --> 56:40.312
Yeah, well,
it's better than herpes, right?

56:41.356 --> 56:43.482
Here are your messages.
I have some meetings...

56:43.650 --> 56:45.651
-...I'd like to set up with you.
-Cool.

56:45.819 --> 56:46.985
Knock that off.

56:47.153 --> 56:50.364
Here is the research that you
asked for before you got sick.

56:50.532 --> 56:52.408
Green Hornet! Me likey!

56:52.575 --> 56:55.661
DA Scanlon called, he said that
he really needs to speak to you.

56:55.829 --> 56:56.453
Boring!

56:56.621 --> 56:58.497
I need to go look at this stuff.

57:07.382 --> 57:09.049
I read the article you sent me.

57:09.217 --> 57:10.509
What are you doing tonight?

57:10.677 --> 57:11.677
-Nothing.
-No?

57:11.845 --> 57:12.719
Nothing at all.

57:12.887 --> 57:16.682
Thought maybe we could get dinner
or get a drink, blow off some steam.

57:17.016 --> 57:19.184
Yeah. l would love to.

57:19.602 --> 57:21.520
-What time?
-l was thinking 7?

57:21.688 --> 57:22.896
We could meet downstairs.

57:24.357 --> 57:25.524
Seven.

57:28.403 --> 57:30.779
-Perfect. l'll be there.
-Okay.

57:34.367 --> 57:35.200
That was awesome!

57:36.202 --> 57:37.244
Hey, Kato!

57:37.412 --> 57:39.538
Can you make me some coffee?

57:42.500 --> 57:44.877
You don't have your whole
little operation set up...

57:45.044 --> 57:47.045
...but whatever you whip up
would be great.

57:47.547 --> 57:48.380
Lenore...

57:48.548 --> 57:50.966
...have you had this
little bastard's coffee?

57:51.134 --> 57:52.009
Because it is...

57:52.177 --> 57:54.344
...scrump-diddly-umptious.
You want a cup?

57:54.512 --> 57:55.471
I'm fine, thank you.

57:55.638 --> 57:57.306
So that's just one...

57:57.474 --> 57:58.557
...cup of coffee, Kato.

57:59.559 --> 58:02.895
So there's this restaurant that just
opened in the San Fernando Valley...

58:03.062 --> 58:06.940
...and it's called
La Maison des la Voide.

58:07.108 --> 58:09.735
The whole thing is you eat
your meal in total darkness.

58:09.903 --> 58:11.069
So with deprived sight...

58:11.237 --> 58:14.323
...each bite is like an orgasm
in your mouth.

58:14.574 --> 58:16.408
And l was thinking
maybe it would be...

58:16.576 --> 58:18.243
-Mr. Reid's office.
-...fun if....

58:18.411 --> 58:20.787
This is DA Scanlon calling
for Britt Reid, please.

58:20.955 --> 58:22.915
Hello, sir.
I'm aware you've been calling.

58:23.082 --> 58:24.750
No, he's had mono.

58:24.918 --> 58:28.086
Let me look. Maybe there's a chance
we could work that out today.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.426
If you ever tell me
to get you coffee again...

58:34.594 --> 58:36.178
...l'll beat the shit out of you!

58:36.346 --> 58:38.972
What are you--? What is wrong
with you? Are you crazy?

58:39.140 --> 58:41.808
This is our plan,
you're supposed to work for me!

58:41.976 --> 58:43.435
You got me a Jamba Juice!

58:43.603 --> 58:45.354
We're supposed to be
brothers, man.

58:45.563 --> 58:47.439
We're supposed to be shon-di!

58:47.607 --> 58:49.441
What happened to that, huh?

58:49.609 --> 58:50.776
I'm sorry.

58:50.944 --> 58:52.361
You should be sorry.

58:52.570 --> 58:55.781
We've become superheroes
and there's a lot of stress involved...

58:55.949 --> 58:58.075
...but you don't gotta
freak out about it.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.118
Now can l have the coffee?

59:00.286 --> 59:02.579
I'm joking. I'm totally joking.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.498
You still mad at me, Kato?

59:04.666 --> 59:05.707
No.

59:05.875 --> 59:06.875
Good.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.794
Because you shouldn't be anyway.

59:08.962 --> 59:10.254
What's up with Lenore, man?

59:10.421 --> 59:12.005
Is she acting weird around me?

59:12.298 --> 59:13.298
No, why?

59:13.466 --> 59:14.466
I "like" like her.

59:14.801 --> 59:17.469
And l can't nail her.
She's completely un-nailable.

59:17.637 --> 59:20.138
It's a terrible fact.
I don't know what to do.

59:20.306 --> 59:22.808
She doesn't like you,
why would you want her?

59:22.976 --> 59:25.811
Maybe it's because she doesn't
like me. lsn't that sick?

59:25.979 --> 59:27.312
That could be it.

59:27.855 --> 59:31.483
Girls are such a drag, Kato.
Thank God we have each other.

59:31.985 --> 59:35.654
Hey! I'm calling a boys' night!
What do you say, huh?

59:35.822 --> 59:36.822
What are you doing?

59:36.990 --> 59:40.993
I didn't know you wanted to hang out.
I'm going for drinks with a friend.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.495
Friend? Who? Come on.

59:44.163 --> 59:45.247
Tony.

59:45.415 --> 59:46.498
Tony?

59:48.334 --> 59:49.710
Well, have fun!

59:49.877 --> 59:51.837
Hey, wait, wait, wait! Can l come?

59:57.677 --> 59:59.177
-You want to try?
-No.

59:59.345 --> 01:00:00.721
Hit the black key.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.514
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:04.182
Okay, l'll try. Which one?

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:19.239
You know, this Green Hornet thing
is just crazy, isn't it?

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:21.575
I mean, it's all l can think about
sometimes.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.455
I feel really in tuned with it. Kind of
like that guy with the Zodiac Killer.

01:00:26.664 --> 01:00:28.707
What about the man
dressed in black?

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.084
Johnny Cash?

01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:32.919
No. His partner.

01:00:33.087 --> 01:00:36.423
His partner. No, I don't think
that that's his partner.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:38.550
That's probably just
some thug he hired.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.053
Anyhow, they'll both
be dead in no time.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:42.721
Yeah.

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:44.640
Why?

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.893
Because the Green Hornet's been
attracting way too much attention.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.646
Whoever's in charge
is gonna get tired of it...

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:53.065
...call him in to make a deal,
then kill him.

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:55.692
It's what Gotti did
to Mangela in '87.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:58.612
In two weeks. Two weeks, tops,
that's what l give them.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.072
-Two weeks?
-Dead.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.660
You're not gonna like this,
but we got nothing.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.079
It's like the Green Hornet
didn't exist.

01:01:07.246 --> 01:01:08.747
Nobody's done a deal with him...

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:09.998
...done time with him.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.249
Nobody's heard of him.

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.251
It's like he came out of thin air.

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:15.462
Yeah, and I've gotta say...

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:18.465
...he's setting a bad example
for the other gangs.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.342
I met with the Armenians today.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.345
They told me if the Hornet
is independent...

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.806
...they wanna be independent too.

01:01:26.432 --> 01:01:28.266
The Armenians truly said that?

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.728
And l heard rumours the Koreans
are talking the same.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:33.146
Which Korean?

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:34.773
Kim.

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:38.610
Kim?

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:42.197
No, Kim never said that.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:45.283
No, we've been doing business
for 25 years. We're friends.

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.619
I'm sorry, boss.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.371
That's just shocking.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:52.124
Maybe we should go down there
and teach them...

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:53.709
...to keep their mouths shut.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:54.459
No.

01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:56.002
No. No.

01:01:56.295 --> 01:01:59.297
I should kill Kim myself.
He's a friend.

01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:03.218
And l'll kill the Armenians too.
It'll make me feel better.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.261
Wait! Wait!

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.265
Great. What about The Hornet?

01:02:15.356 --> 01:02:16.565
Britt?

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:19.484
What you doing here?

01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:22.195
Guess what, you son of a bitch.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:25.907
We got mail.

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:29.327
We got Hornet mail!
He e-mailed! lt happened!

01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:32.706
Come here, look! Come here!
Look, look, look!

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.584
"Green Hornet." Me.

01:02:35.793 --> 01:02:37.335
"Good job on the meth lab.

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:40.881
The place was costing me money
and l wanted to shut it down."

01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:41.882
That's B.S.

01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:45.260
"Let's talk about another venture
that could be mutually beneficial.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:48.513
Please meet tomorrow
at the lot on Fifth and Union...

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:50.807
...in downtown at 4 p.m."

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:53.935
Another adventure for
the Green Hornet...

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:56.354
...and his nameless sidekick!

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:01.526
Looks like we've got
some planning to do.

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.403
It could be a trap.

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:06.865
Like how Gotti killed
Mangela in '87.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.201
Where did you hear that from?

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.329
The History Channel.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:13.538
Oh, yeah?

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.457
Should we go downtown now...

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.792
...and check it out?

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.794
No, that's cool. l got that covered.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.087
You fill up the car
with weapons and stuff.

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:25.342
So you're just gonna come up
with the plan by yourself?

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:27.052
Bingo.

01:03:27.386 --> 01:03:29.596
I don't know if that's the best idea.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:31.473
-Course you don't.
-What's that mean?

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:34.726
Oh, it means that you think
you're an awesome karate dude...

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.813
...that can do anything, and that
I'm an incompetent schmuck...

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.398
...who needs a gun
that shoots farts at people.

01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:42.484
I'm saying,
we should do this together.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.152
I'm saying you should go home.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:48.907
You should go to sleep so tomorrow
you could process my incredible plan.

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:51.743
Fine.

01:03:54.747 --> 01:03:56.414
This is so stupid.

01:03:56.582 --> 01:03:58.583
We pissed this guy off.

01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:00.377
Now we're walking into his turf.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.879
We walked into their turf last time
and guess what.

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:04.756
We kicked the crap out of them.

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:07.843
And everyone knows: what happens
when you corner a hornet?

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.094
You get stung.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:11.179
"You get stung."
What does that mean?

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:14.724
This is not a game, Britt.
And you're gonna get us killed.

01:04:14.892 --> 01:04:18.436
If you don't like my plan,
you do not have to be a part of it.

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:20.647
-l don't think you have a plan.
-l do!

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:22.232
I just haven't told you yet.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.401
And it's amazing, okay?

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:27.279
So are you in, or are you
chickening out like a bitch?

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:28.613
You are a bitch.

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:30.949
Not now, Kato, not now.
Turn in here.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:39.124
There they are.
Game faces, Kato. Game faces.

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.420
Here's the plan.
Take this, put it in your ear.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:45.213
You listen in on my phone...

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.882
...which I've taped to my chest.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:50.260
When I say the secret word,
which is "Constantinople"...

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:53.763
...l'll kick the old guy in the nuts,
you blow them up with missiles.

01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:56.057
Truck! Kato, back up!

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:57.309
Back up! Back up!

01:04:57.476 --> 01:04:58.977
Okay, okay, okay.

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:02.480
This is not part of the plan!

01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:03.398
No shit!

01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:18.079
And so thunder strikes lightning.

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:24.085
Okay, don't panic!

01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:28.173
The worst thing we can do
right now is panic.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.966
Just let me think.

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:38.683
Okay, don't worry.
I'll get us out of here, okay?

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:41.519
No, you won't! We're gonna
die now, you ass-wipe.

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:44.189
Well, with that attitude we will!
Come on, man!

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:51.112
-l think l'm claustrophobic!
-Let me think.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:51.821
Oh, no!

01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:54.240
-l can't breathe!
-Listen, listen.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:00.038
We're buried!
We are totally buried!

01:06:00.247 --> 01:06:01.957
Okay, okay.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.541
What are you doing?

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.294
Either killing us or saving us.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.881
Missiles armed?
That's your plan? You'll blow us up.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.633
That's not a good plan!

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.051
Disarm them, man!

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:14.678
Shall we part?

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.180
Feel like kebabs for dinner?

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:23.979
Look out!

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.193
Chili!

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.405
They killed him! They killed Chili!

01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:43.873
Run!

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.258
Oh, shit.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.301
-There's thorns in these bushes!
-Shut up!

01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:56.344
Shut up!

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:00.849
This thing has no aim!

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:01.933
It sucks!

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:03.435
You have no aim!

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:07.439
Britt!

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.531
What?

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:28.626
I smash window, you shoot in.

01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:30.628
Every man for himself!

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.055
Go away!

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:42.390
Die!

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:43.725
Oh, shit!

01:08:07.958 --> 01:08:10.460
So you just gonna
ignore me now, is that it?

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.128
Like a baby?

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:14.964
And go home,
eat some baby food maybe?

01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:16.633
Drink some milk?

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:20.261
Why don't you talk like a baby.
Mama, goo-goo. You baby.

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.188
Baby.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:36.194
Explosives were triggered
from that vehicle, destroying it...

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:38.113
-...freeing the Green Hornet....
-Dickweed.

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.825
You're calling me that too?
I know people call me that.

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:43.993
That's not a surprise.
That's not a mystery.

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:45.203
Why not?

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:47.663
You say rude things to me
all day, every day.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.207
That's not how partners work.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.542
We're not partners.

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:54.712
I'm the hero, you're my sidekick!
That's what this is.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.714
I'm lndy, you're Short Round!

01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:59.216
Simon, Garfunkel!

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.719
Scooby, Doo!

01:09:01.886 --> 01:09:04.555
Stop fooling yourself.
Green Hornet is nothing without me.

01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:08.225
I made the knockout gas. l alone
designed and built the Black Beauty.

01:09:09.019 --> 01:09:10.520
And l didn't help at all?

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:12.229
How? Ejector seats?

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:13.523
Exactly.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:15.692
What a great idea.

01:09:16.068 --> 01:09:18.236
You may have started
this Green Hornet thing...

01:09:18.444 --> 01:09:20.238
...because you hated your father.

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:23.198
-You're an egomaniac.
-l know.

01:09:24.033 --> 01:09:25.910
Exactly like your father.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:30.665
You are a jealous,
pathetic little man!

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:33.042
Fine. You're doing great
with Lenore.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.919
What the hell does that mean?

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.337
Don't you walk away on that!

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.924
What, you're charming her
pants off, that's what...

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:41.426
...l'm supposed to believe?

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:44.929
No, that is a filthy gesture!

01:09:45.096 --> 01:09:46.180
You know I like her!

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:47.932
I confided in you, Kato!

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.268
I trusted you!
I told you l liked her!

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:52.854
Stop it! You hit on
everything that moves.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.106
I'm amazed you haven't...

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:56.399
...hit on me yet.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.612
If you keep talking like this, Kato...

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:02.614
...l'm gonna beat
the shit out of you.

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:05.533
-Just so you know.
-l'd like to see you try.

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.076
You are a yuppie wimp...

01:10:07.244 --> 01:10:10.538
...and l'm a martial arts expert who
grew up penniless on the streets.

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.916
You grew up penis-less
on the streets.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:14.459
Funny!

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.961
Heroes beat sidekicks, period!

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:18.463
-Don't do that.
-Do what?

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:19.797
I'm warning you.

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.471
Okay, l'm gonna forget that slap...

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:27.931
...so we can fix this.

01:10:28.098 --> 01:10:30.308
Okay, okay, you're right.
You're right.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.936
Let's talk. I'm sorry.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:37.232
Sacked you like a bitch, Kato!

01:10:42.112 --> 01:10:44.030
Come here! Chop-chop!

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:50.328
You like that, Kato? You like it?
This is what you get...

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.413
...when you corner a hornet!

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:53.665
You get--

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.166
Oh, God!

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:03.424
Now I'm gonna hurt you.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.093
I'd like to see you try.

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:11.933
Get this stupid thing off me...

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.268
...you cheating bastard!

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.857
You dirty bastard!

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:35.707
You idiot.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:37.500
Okay, let's--

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.712
Can we end this?

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.803
You are so stubborn.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.070
Do you like it? You like it?

01:12:06.238 --> 01:12:07.530
No, I don't like it!

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:08.906
You like it? You like it?

01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:09.949
I don't like it.

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:21.336
Okay. Now we can end this.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.838
Just stop. Just stop.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.090
Just stop! Stop!

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:27.133
Stop, stop, stop!

01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:38.269
Britt!

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:44.525
Help!

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.619
Get out of my pool.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:57.622
Get off my property!

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.457
You're fired!

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.292
-Never come back!
-Help!

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:05.421
I can't swim!

01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:13.930
Britt! Britt!

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:39.997
Lenore, it's me.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.083
It's me, Kato.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.127
What the hell?

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:46.629
-That's for whatever lie you told Britt.
-What?

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:49.006
He called me a minx,
and then he fired me.

01:13:52.302 --> 01:13:54.679
Chili was a fine warrior.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:58.266
He was a man of honour and dignity.

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:01.727
We must show our respect.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:04.522
And we must show it in blood.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:07.275
Popeye, go forth.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.111
Take these words
and spread them:

01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:13.614
The bounty, 1 million dollars.

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:16.534
The prey, the Green Hornet.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:18.703
Dead, if possible.

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:21.122
Alive, if necessary.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:25.001
I don't care whence they have to go,
or who they have to do.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:28.754
I want the head of the Green Hornet,
and l want it tonight!

01:14:28.922 --> 01:14:32.383
Find him. Kill him. Take him out.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.058
How do you do?

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:43.686
Everybody, chase The Hornet!

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:46.522
It's about The Hornet.
We want him dead.

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.690
All right.

01:14:48.525 --> 01:14:49.859
Hey, you, do me a favour.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.570
Listen to me. He's got a mask on.

01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:55.239
I need you to spread the word,
all right? Kill him.

01:14:55.407 --> 01:14:56.908
The mask was green. Yeah.

01:14:57.075 --> 01:14:58.159
Yo.

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:01.913
A green mask.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.415
A hit on The Hornet.
A million bucks.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:05.583
Good, good.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.585
What's going on?
What's the word?

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:11.422
Listen, this Green Hornet.
He's got a mask on.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.382
One million dollar.
The Green Hornet.

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.760
You got it. All right.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.094
Hey, Jacko!

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.388
Hey, man, you wanna
make a few bucks?

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.542
You failed to kill me
The Hornet, Popeye!

01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:57.760
I warned you about this.

01:15:57.928 --> 01:15:59.679
You heightened this
thing to a point...

01:15:59.846 --> 01:16:02.265
...where it had to reach
some kind of a climax.

01:16:02.432 --> 01:16:04.642
Well, here it is.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:10.314
I hope you realise now that
you should stay out of my way.

01:16:10.482 --> 01:16:12.567
Let me run this paper.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:21.742
A gruesome scene last night as
bodies were found across the city...

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.579
...every one of them
wearing green clothing.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:30.334
DA Scanlon's office, please.

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:33.212
The victims were unrelated
and authorities believe...

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.964
...their only connection was...

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:38.426
...their choice of attire.
As a precaution, police are advising...

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:41.846
...citizens to avoid wearing
the colour green, so as not to be...

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:43.806
...unwittingly targeted.

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:47.852
This is my fault. This is
what I did with this paper.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:48.853
So what?

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:52.356
At least you tried. Your dad
would have understood that.

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:54.859
Look, running a newspaper
must be difficult.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:58.571
I mean, if it's anything like running
a re-election campaign...

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:00.615
...it's gotta be a pain in the ass.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:05.786
Fortunately, l think we can
make each other's lives easier.

01:17:06.538 --> 01:17:07.830
How?

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:09.707
There are two sides
to every story.

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:12.877
I mean, some people,
they see an event and they...

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:15.963
...interpret it as this crime war,
you know?

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.882
Other people see
the same incident...

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.343
...and they interpret it
as an isolated event.

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:22.845
-Yeah.
-l guess I could...

01:17:24.514 --> 01:17:27.892
...help you decide how
these incidents are exposed.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.810
In the public interest, of course.

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:34.023
Now, if this collaboration
leads to assert my position...

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:36.400
...well, l will make sure that you...

01:17:36.568 --> 01:17:39.904
...enjoy compensation in return.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.491
What kind of compensation?

01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:46.952
Frank, are you--?

01:17:47.245 --> 01:17:49.580
Are you saying you want me
to slant the news...

01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:51.999
...for your re-election?
Is that what this is?

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.542
I thought you needed my help.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:56.295
We help each other out...

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:58.923
...so that we can both get ahead.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:01.467
This is mutually beneficial.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.679
Okay, l get it now.

01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:07.348
You went to my dad,
he rejected your offer...

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.558
...and you think you can
push me around.

01:18:09.893 --> 01:18:11.560
That's what you think?

01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:13.479
No, what l think...

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.191
...is that you overvalue
your dad's integrity.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:21.987
You get out of my office
right this second.

01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:28.786
This might be
what you're looking for.

01:18:28.995 --> 01:18:29.995
Thank you.

01:18:30.163 --> 01:18:31.247
You're welcome.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.773
Stay here.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:02.945
Boss, what are you
doing up here?

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:04.780
We were waiting for you down--

01:19:04.948 --> 01:19:06.157
Come here.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.827
I've been doing some thinking.

01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:12.455
And l had a revelation.

01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:14.415
Look, l'm obsolete.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.292
I'm a dinosaur.

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.836
Not in the scary way,
in the extinct way.

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.588
And it's time for changes.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.089
You know, it's time for me...

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.382
...to gain some...

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:25.843
...charisma.

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:28.929
I've no idea what you're
talking about. I mean--

01:19:29.806 --> 01:19:33.350
I'm talking about a motif.
A theme.

01:19:33.518 --> 01:19:34.518
A mask.

01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:36.520
Perhaps a stylish cape.

01:19:36.688 --> 01:19:39.064
I'm talking about the death
of Chudnofsky...

01:19:39.232 --> 01:19:42.067
...and the rebirth of Bloodnofsky.

01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:44.487
What do you say?

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:47.573
Honestly?

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:48.824
Yeah.

01:19:49.826 --> 01:19:53.788
I think that is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:56.332
Why is that stupid?

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.167
That's not stupid.

01:19:59.085 --> 01:20:00.711
Bloodnofsky.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.215
I was gonna wear red.

01:20:04.382 --> 01:20:06.175
For blood, get it?

01:20:06.551 --> 01:20:08.135
That's scary.

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:09.887
And cool.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:11.514
Get this:

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:16.477
"Be it my mask or your blood, red will
be the last colour you'll ever see."

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.731
I say that to people
when l kill them.

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:22.900
The Green Hornet killed Chili.

01:20:23.109 --> 01:20:25.611
I am minus an eyeball here.

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:28.656
You can't go and tell these
guys that, they'll think you've...

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.157
...lost your bloody mind.

01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:32.743
I think you're having
a midlife crisis here.

01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:34.829
Seriously, you're starting
to scare me.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.374
Want to know a secret?

01:20:39.584 --> 01:20:41.585
I'm starting to scare myself.

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:49.593
Gentlemen...

01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:53.180
...the reign of Bloodnofsky
starts tonight.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.897
-Hey. l'm sorry l fired you!
-Get out of here!

01:21:02.065 --> 01:21:04.108
I shouldn't have
called you a minx.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:05.776
Look, please, just listen to me.

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.611
Kato lied about us, okay?

01:21:07.779 --> 01:21:10.072
You should have found that out
before you fire me.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.907
-Nothing happened?
-No.

01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:14.952
Oh, thank God! I knew it!
I knew nothing happened!

01:21:15.161 --> 01:21:17.621
-That ass. He said you did this.
-What?

01:21:17.789 --> 01:21:18.455
What is that?

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:21.292
I don't know. lt's gross.
That's not why I'm here.

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:23.127
I need you to come back and work.

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.629
I'll do whatever you want.
I'll double your salary.

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:28.549
Things at The Sentinel
Not what they seem.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.467
As soon as Scanlon
started running...

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:33.554
...my father stopped printing news
about hard crime.

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.306
He was making Scanlon
look good.

01:21:35.473 --> 01:21:37.683
And l have to make it right.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:42.146
And l realised that if I want to do
what's best for this world...

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:45.649
...that The Daily Sentinel is the most
responsible way to do that.

01:21:45.817 --> 01:21:47.276
But here's the problem:

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:48.652
I don't know...

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.070
...anything...

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.197
-...about journalism.
-That's the truth.

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:54.658
Look, l need someone who does.

01:21:54.826 --> 01:21:57.828
I need someone who
I can trust with my life.

01:21:57.996 --> 01:21:59.246
I'm just-- Okay?

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:02.666
I need someone who is you.
I need you, Lenore.

01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:05.669
Will you please help me?

01:22:08.673 --> 01:22:09.924
Britt, I--

01:22:10.842 --> 01:22:12.343
I know, I know.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.428
Oh, my God!

01:22:15.972 --> 01:22:17.348
Oh, God.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.099
What is your problem?

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:20.100
God.

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:21.477
Why did you do that to me?

01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:22.978
Because you tried to kiss me!

01:22:23.146 --> 01:22:25.439
-Yeah, we were gonna make out.
-No, we weren't.

01:22:25.815 --> 01:22:28.692
Then l guess I owe you an apology,
because l misread that.

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:29.860
As usual.

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:33.447
Okay. Look, I'm sorry. l didn't plan
on kissing you when l said all that.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.616
Will you come back
and work for me, please?

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:36.867
Pretty please?

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:38.535
Double my salary.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:40.454
And l want a parking spot.

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:42.873
You don't have a parking spot?
Oh, that sucks.

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:46.210
And if you ever so much
as look at my ass again...

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:47.378
I can't even see it.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.215
...l will sue you for sexual harassment.
Do you understand?

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:52.883
Hugs?

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:55.135
Where my hugs at, y'all?

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:26.417
-Britt Reid's office.
-Frank Scanlon.

01:23:27.293 --> 01:23:28.460
Please hold.

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:30.421
DA Scanlon.

01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:32.006
-Really?
-Yes.

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:33.799
Hello?

01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:35.926
Hey, Britt, it's Scanlon.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:39.096
Listen, l think l owe you
an apology.

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:53.444
Too much blood in the gutter.
You win. Let's split L.A.

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:56.947
You get the L. I get the A.
That means we share the gold...

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:58.615
...and the work.

01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:06.540
One million dollars for today.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:09.460
I think you misunderstood
where I was coming from...

01:24:09.627 --> 01:24:11.962
...and l'd like a chance
to clarify some things.

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:13.380
Things are pretty clear.

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:15.132
-l got three words for you:
-No.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.092
-Suck it, you dick face!
-Look.

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.803
Tell him that you wanna meet him.
This is journalism.

01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:23.015
If you wanna be an investigative
reporter, you have to investigate.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:24.808
Tell him that you wanna meet him.

01:24:24.976 --> 01:24:27.978
-Might've gotten disconnected, Britt.
-You're right. Watch this.

01:24:32.984 --> 01:24:33.984
I was joking.

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.820
Yeah, why don't we get together
and talk about things?

01:24:36.988 --> 01:24:38.155
That's a good idea. Okay?

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:41.075
Let's meet for dinner.
A place called Gonpachi Hibachi.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.659
Little place on La Cienega.

01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:44.203
Around 8:30?

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:50.125
La Cienega...

01:24:50.293 --> 01:24:51.210
...8:30.

01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:31.834
Britt!

01:25:43.054 --> 01:25:43.887
Hey, Frank.

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:44.930
Hey, Britt.

01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:46.098
Good to see you.

01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:48.058
I'm having a sake.
What are you having?

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:49.560
Yeah, l'll have some sake.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.230
Thanks for coming.

01:25:53.898 --> 01:25:55.065
No problem.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:28.640
Mr. Chudnofsky?

01:26:28.808 --> 01:26:30.934
Bloodnofsky. Blood-nof-sky.

01:26:31.102 --> 01:26:34.313
I commissioned the Green Hornet.
You're the chauffeur.

01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:36.148
Partner.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:37.524
Where's The Hornet?

01:26:38.651 --> 01:26:39.484
Right there.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.780
Whoa, we only get half the team?

01:26:43.948 --> 01:26:45.324
Who says you're the good half?

01:26:50.663 --> 01:26:51.872
Where's Reid?

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.207
Guess.

01:26:56.127 --> 01:26:59.296
Any of you move, you're dead.

01:27:00.131 --> 01:27:02.299
I'm not actually here
for forgiveness, Britt.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:03.508
I don't understand.

01:27:03.676 --> 01:27:05.135
You understand nothing...

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:07.471
...so l'm gonna explain it
to you very simply.

01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:10.974
If you ever come across any article
regarding a major crime...

01:27:11.142 --> 01:27:12.809
...a man named
Benjamin Chudnofsky...

01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:15.270
...or anything that makes
this city think...

01:27:15.438 --> 01:27:18.565
...l am not the fine line protecting
the light from the darkness...

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:20.192
...you're gonna bring it to me.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.777
You're gonna bring it to me...

01:27:21.945 --> 01:27:24.112
...and l'll tell you
if it's okay to print...

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.323
...in your stupid little newspaper.

01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:29.576
That's how l did it with your dad.

01:27:30.453 --> 01:27:32.704
And that's how you and l
are gonna do it.

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:38.460
Scanlon, are you saying you want me
to let you write the news?

01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:44.341
Finally you understand.

01:27:46.386 --> 01:27:49.179
Yup. l understand, all right.

01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:50.722
Here's what l understand.

01:27:51.182 --> 01:27:54.017
That you, son, just got played...

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.228
...by a player.

01:27:56.562 --> 01:27:58.522
Recording device. USB.

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:00.232
No, you can't have it, it's mine!

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.317
You stupid schmuck!

01:28:02.485 --> 01:28:05.737
I got you by the balls, Scanlon.
I own a newspaper, genius.

01:28:05.905 --> 01:28:08.031
-This'll be front-page.
-l have to say...

01:28:08.199 --> 01:28:09.741
-...I'm impressed.
-You should be.

01:28:09.909 --> 01:28:11.076
It won't do you any good.

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:14.204
How could it not? Are you
gonna kill me in this restaurant?

01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:15.205
Yes.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:17.124
What, you're gonna murder me?

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:20.002
Yeah. Like l murdered your father.

01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:23.755
I don't think so. My dad was not
murdered. He died of a bee sting.

01:28:23.923 --> 01:28:26.591
No, no, your father died of
an overdose of apitoxin...

01:28:26.759 --> 01:28:30.220
...most commonly found in a bee sting,
which he happened to be allergic to.

01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:32.014
But that apitoxin...

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.891
...was administered by me.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.020
Shit!

01:28:38.521 --> 01:28:42.065
Think, Britt. You can figure this out,
my son, with your brains.

01:28:42.233 --> 01:28:44.818
It's almost like time slows down.

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:48.488
That's right. Think. Slowly.

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:51.408
Okay, two years ago,
Scanlon decides to run for DA.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:53.910
He says he's cleaning up
the streets of L.A...

01:28:54.078 --> 01:28:55.620
...which is impossible.

01:28:55.788 --> 01:28:57.622
So he asked the media
to slant the news.

01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:00.000
And you go along with it
like everybody else?

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:01.918
No way. l refused.

01:29:02.086 --> 01:29:04.921
So he-- Shit! What does he do?
So Scanlon decides...

01:29:05.089 --> 01:29:06.089
...to go really dirty.

01:29:06.257 --> 01:29:09.092
Makes a pact with a criminal.
Chudnofsky kills your reporter.

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.427
Vertolibe? Vertoleeb?

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.513
l didn't want more bloodshed,
so I stopped reporting on crime.

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.474
To be honest,
in the last few years...

01:29:15.641 --> 01:29:17.934
...this paper has dipped
in quality and ambition.

01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:20.145
Scanlon can hold up
his part of the deal...

01:29:20.313 --> 01:29:23.732
...keeping the media under control,
and Chudnofsky does what he wants!

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:24.941
To be honest....

01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:27.944
But Chudnofsky
had a different plan.

01:29:28.112 --> 01:29:30.781
He wanted to take over
all the gangs of L.A.

01:29:30.948 --> 01:29:32.616
So that's when you decided...

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:33.950
...to cut the strings.

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:37.579
I couldn't look in the mirror.
I hated every word I said to you...

01:29:37.747 --> 01:29:38.789
...that morning, Britt.

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.666
So you start reporting
on crime again.

01:29:41.834 --> 01:29:43.418
And now Scanlon
is a dead man...

01:29:43.586 --> 01:29:45.462
...unless he proves
he's still in control.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:47.255
He has no choice
but to organise...

01:29:47.423 --> 01:29:48.799
...a meeting with you...

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:51.134
...and he kills you himself.

01:29:52.678 --> 01:29:53.804
In the end...

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.473
...you stood up
for what's right, Dad.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.392
Now I have to do the same.

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:06.525
I can see by that expression you've
had on your face for five minutes...

01:30:06.692 --> 01:30:09.277
...that you're piecing this together,
but it's no good.

01:30:09.445 --> 01:30:11.530
You're about to be killed
by the Green Hornet.

01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:13.156
What?

01:30:17.912 --> 01:30:20.664
The Green Hornet's sidekick!
He's got a gun!

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:24.751
Bluff! Bluff!

01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:26.503
Eradicate!

01:30:29.882 --> 01:30:32.426
Before you do this,
I want you to know that l'm sorry.

01:30:32.718 --> 01:30:34.678
I'm sorry for everything.

01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:36.721
I forgive you.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:43.353
Hey, not me. Him, stupid.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:45.272
Confused? You should be.

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:47.357
Go, go.

01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:48.650
Let's bail, Kato!

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:50.360
Back here!

01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:00.871
We're cornered!

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:03.373
Know what happens
when you corner a hornet?

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:04.875
-No!
-You get stung!

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:08.462
Oh, Je--!

01:31:16.053 --> 01:31:17.053
See? Backups.

01:31:20.224 --> 01:31:21.391
Go, go, go!

01:31:26.397 --> 01:31:28.648
What the hell?
He's supposed to kill Britt Reid!

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:30.942
-He's shooting at me!
-Embark the vehicle!

01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:32.486
Okay, okay, okay.

01:31:42.788 --> 01:31:43.788
Are you okay?

01:31:43.956 --> 01:31:45.457
Wait. Yeah, l'm fine.

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:46.958
My outfit's back here.

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:52.589
Britt Reid is the Green Hornet!

01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:54.716
I know.
You hired a guy to kill himself.

01:31:55.927 --> 01:31:57.093
Shut up!

01:31:57.887 --> 01:32:00.597
Britt Reid recorded
the whole conversation...

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:02.098
...on some sushi drive USB!

01:32:02.266 --> 01:32:03.600
We can't lose him!

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:05.685
We're not losing him,
we're following him!

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:06.853
Oh, Kato. Thank you.

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:09.314
-l need to hug you to thank you!
-What the hell?

01:32:09.482 --> 01:32:10.148
Okay.

01:32:10.316 --> 01:32:11.441
-To the house?
-No!

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:12.692
Here's the dilly yo.

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:16.196
We gotta get this to The Sentinel.
It's got Scanlon spilling the beans.

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:18.114
We're gonna put it on the Net.

01:32:18.282 --> 01:32:20.075
It's what my father
would have wanted.

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:22.077
-You like your father now?
-Yes!

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:23.954
You see, he wasn't a dick after all.

01:32:24.121 --> 01:32:27.791
Well, he was a dick, just not
really how we thought he was.

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:31.628
At the end, he wasn't a di-- It's
complicated. l'll explain later, okay?

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:33.630
It's a lot of conflicting emotions.

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:35.465
Let's roll, Britt.

01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:45.809
Here's the thing, honestly.

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:48.019
I've been jealous of you
this entire time.

01:32:48.187 --> 01:32:50.564
-You're awesome. You built this car.
-l know.

01:32:50.773 --> 01:32:52.899
-You know karate. You're charming.
-Thank you!

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.901
These guys are amazingly
well organised.

01:32:57.196 --> 01:32:57.862
Hold on!

01:33:00.533 --> 01:33:01.992
Yeah! Yeah!

01:33:02.868 --> 01:33:04.202
Oh, yeah!

01:33:09.875 --> 01:33:11.084
Burn them from the side!

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:12.919
Door guns!

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:13.920
What's a door gun?

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:14.671
Here!

01:33:20.386 --> 01:33:21.678
The other side!

01:33:23.347 --> 01:33:24.055
Your turn!

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:30.854
Oh, God!

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:39.696
Oh, shit!

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:43.950
We lost him!

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:46.119
-He's gone! He's gone!
-Yeah!

01:33:47.121 --> 01:33:48.705
Shit! He's back!

01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:50.373
You gotta be kidding me.

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:51.750
These guys are good!

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:54.210
Over there, over there!

01:33:54.712 --> 01:33:56.713
We're not gonna make it, dude.

01:33:57.882 --> 01:33:59.049
We're not gonna make it!

01:33:59.216 --> 01:34:00.550
Yeah, we're gonna make it!

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:16.066
That's a very big gun.

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:29.996
Kato, be careful!

01:34:31.624 --> 01:34:32.499
Take the wheel.

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:33.416
What?!

01:34:33.584 --> 01:34:34.751
-Take the wheel.
-l can't!

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:35.877
Yes, you can!

01:34:36.253 --> 01:34:37.879
Nunchucks?! That was my idea!

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:39.923
Where are you going?

01:34:46.972 --> 01:34:48.765
Are you okay?
What are you doing?

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:03.697
Shit! Shit!

01:35:03.906 --> 01:35:04.531
Kato!

01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:05.532
Jesus!

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.158
I don't know what anything does!

01:35:07.785 --> 01:35:08.993
Why didn't you do this in English?!

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:19.504
-What are you saying?
-Closer.

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:20.672
Just jump in!

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:21.840
Turn the knob!

01:35:22.007 --> 01:35:23.466
These guys are shooting at me!

01:35:25.302 --> 01:35:26.886
-Sorry! l'm sorry!
-Turn the knob!

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.388
-l don't know how!
-Calm down!

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:31.641
How do l stop it?

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.185
Oh, God, l'm sorry.

01:35:39.358 --> 01:35:40.692
-lt's on fire!
-lt's okay.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.152
It's okay!

01:35:42.319 --> 01:35:43.820
Next time, don't touch anything.

01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:48.366
Kato! Look!

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:49.659
We made it!

01:35:49.827 --> 01:35:51.411
-Kato, we made it!
-Hell, yeah!

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:52.579
Yeah!

01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:54.372
-l can't.
-Okay, that's cool.

01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:03.465
Oh, we're screwed!

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:26.696
Come on, hurry! Hurry up!

01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:35.830
Did you drop it?

01:36:35.998 --> 01:36:36.664
Yes.

01:36:36.832 --> 01:36:37.665
Shit!

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:44.005
Go get it! l'll cover you!

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:45.465
Wish me luck!

01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:48.301
Good luck!

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:12.617
Dear Hornet...

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.202
...be it my mask...

01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:16.037
...or your blood, red will be...

01:37:16.205 --> 01:37:16.913
...the last--

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:20.750
It's Britt Reid!

01:37:20.918 --> 01:37:22.210
There he is! Get him!

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.254
Don't let them go!

01:37:24.421 --> 01:37:25.421
Come on!

01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:28.007
Get him! Get him!

01:37:31.595 --> 01:37:32.512
Let me shoot him!

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:35.056
Oh, no.

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.726
Shoot to kill!

01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:42.021
You brought a gas mask?!

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:43.648
Of course I brought a gas mask!

01:37:43.816 --> 01:37:44.774
Just for yourself?!

01:37:49.154 --> 01:37:50.280
Where the--?

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:12.302
There!

01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:18.474
There! Behind the paper!

01:38:25.774 --> 01:38:26.608
Over here!

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:33.698
The helmet, it fogs up everything.

01:38:42.791 --> 01:38:44.125
There. There.

01:38:44.293 --> 01:38:44.959
Shoot, shoot.

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:51.507
Kato!

01:38:54.136 --> 01:38:55.637
Kato, save me!

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:05.438
I'm ungassable!

01:39:13.238 --> 01:39:14.030
Move it!

01:39:21.163 --> 01:39:22.372
That was dangerous.

01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:26.876
Drop me by the elevators,
I'll take it from here!

01:39:32.049 --> 01:39:33.758
No, we stay together!

01:39:40.474 --> 01:39:41.683
Get in the front seat!

01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:42.642
Quick! Quick!

01:39:52.903 --> 01:39:54.696
Tenth floor! Tenth floor!

01:39:54.863 --> 01:39:55.571
What works?

01:39:55.739 --> 01:39:57.240
-Missiles?
-Four missiles left.

01:39:57.408 --> 01:39:58.533
Hornet gun?

01:39:58.701 --> 01:39:59.867
Check. Machine guns?

01:40:00.035 --> 01:40:00.702
Check.

01:40:00.869 --> 01:40:01.661
Does it drive?

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.496
Front-wheel drive.

01:40:09.003 --> 01:40:09.669
Get out!

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:10.837
Get out of here!

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:18.261
You can let me out here.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:24.726
Bazooka!

01:40:24.893 --> 01:40:25.852
Guy with a bazooka!

01:40:28.731 --> 01:40:29.397
Missile!

01:40:30.232 --> 01:40:31.315
Fire!

01:40:41.326 --> 01:40:42.326
Reload!

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:47.915
Kato, they're here.

01:40:48.083 --> 01:40:49.292
Go be a journalist.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:50.543
I'll kick ass.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:51.627
There they are!

01:40:51.795 --> 01:40:52.420
There!

01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:02.055
Come on.

01:41:09.104 --> 01:41:09.812
I'm there.

01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:12.231
In one minute,
this'll be all over the world.

01:41:15.486 --> 01:41:16.152
Blue team, go!

01:41:17.988 --> 01:41:18.988
Start up.

01:41:22.659 --> 01:41:23.493
Shit!

01:41:28.332 --> 01:41:28.998
Yeah.

01:41:44.306 --> 01:41:44.972
There!

01:42:07.913 --> 01:42:09.705
Can you see him? I can't see him.

01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:38.818
Oh, l'm so stupid.

01:42:49.246 --> 01:42:50.538
All right, Reid!

01:42:51.081 --> 01:42:52.540
Hand over the thing.

01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:53.541
You want it?!

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:55.543
Go get it!

01:43:00.424 --> 01:43:02.049
Where is it? Where is it?

01:43:02.217 --> 01:43:03.551
I am Bloodnofsky.

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.429
I killed a thousand before
and l'll kill a thousand more.

01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:16.981
Now tremble before your death.

01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:20.026
For be it my mask,
or be it your blood...

01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:23.112
...red will be the last colour
you'll ever see.

01:44:13.038 --> 01:44:13.913
Britt.

01:44:14.122 --> 01:44:14.997
Britt!

01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:27.802
-Shit!
-Hey!

01:44:28.387 --> 01:44:30.304
End of the road, Scanlon.

01:44:30.472 --> 01:44:32.682
Okay, okay.
Let's just calm down.

01:44:32.849 --> 01:44:34.433
Hand over the sushi.

01:44:35.477 --> 01:44:36.602
Yeah, hand it over.

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:37.770
We can talk about it.

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.605
-On the ground, now!
-Get down!

01:44:39.856 --> 01:44:41.691
It's the Green Hornet. Shoot him!

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:48.531
Britt, quick!

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.909
I'm District Attorney Frank Scanlon!

01:44:52.077 --> 01:44:54.870
That is the Green Hornet.
Go shoot him!

01:44:56.331 --> 01:44:57.707
Down on the ground!

01:44:59.876 --> 01:45:01.502
Kato, I screwed up!

01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:03.379
Scanlon's gonna
get away scot-free!

01:45:04.214 --> 01:45:04.839
No, he's not.

01:45:33.618 --> 01:45:35.161
Don't move. Don't move.

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:46.339
Holy shit!

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:48.215
Ejector seats!

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:49.759
You actually built them!

01:45:49.926 --> 01:45:50.926
It was a good idea.

01:45:58.060 --> 01:46:00.269
This is really scary.

01:46:01.271 --> 01:46:03.397
A high-speed chase
between the Green Hornet...

01:46:03.565 --> 01:46:06.359
...and gang members has led
to The Daily Sentinel office...

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:07.943
Oh, my God! I called it.

01:46:08.111 --> 01:46:11.030
...leaving a trail of demolished cars
and trucks in their path.

01:46:11.198 --> 01:46:14.909
Here's the story: We're on our way
to a costume party. Okay?

01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:17.203
We gotta get out of our suits.

01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:19.455
Where the hell are we gonna go?

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:22.541
No one knows why
the district attorney....

01:46:23.377 --> 01:46:24.210
Lenore!

01:46:24.378 --> 01:46:25.169
No, no, no.

01:46:26.963 --> 01:46:28.089
-Lenore, stop!
-No, wait!

01:46:28.256 --> 01:46:29.715
Stop. Lenore!

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:30.674
Lenore! Wait.

01:46:30.842 --> 01:46:31.967
How do you know my name?

01:46:32.135 --> 01:46:32.927
Kato.

01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:34.387
-lt's me.
-Oh, my God.

01:46:35.263 --> 01:46:37.973
You assholes!

01:46:38.141 --> 01:46:40.643
What the hell are you doing?!
You guys are criminals!

01:46:40.811 --> 01:46:42.478
You're criminals! Oh, my God.

01:46:42.646 --> 01:46:44.814
-Stop.
-We're helping people.

01:46:44.981 --> 01:46:47.358
Why ask me to do research
on the Green Hornet...

01:46:47.526 --> 01:46:49.068
...when you are
the Green Hornet?

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:52.321
We don't know what we're doing.
We needed you. Don't you see?

01:46:52.489 --> 01:46:53.823
-You're the mastermind.
-What?

01:46:54.908 --> 01:46:56.325
This is the police. Open up.

01:46:56.493 --> 01:46:59.078
Please don't screw us.
We were trying to be good people.

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.246
Think about it.

01:47:01.748 --> 01:47:03.666
Hello, officer, can I help you?

01:47:03.834 --> 01:47:06.043
We're looking for two masked men.
Seen anything?

01:47:06.211 --> 01:47:07.503
Yeah, of course.

01:47:07.712 --> 01:47:08.504
Really?

01:47:08.672 --> 01:47:10.673
They're all over the news
all the time.

01:47:11.299 --> 01:47:14.301
All right. Well, please report
anything suspicious.

01:47:14.469 --> 01:47:15.469
Absolutely.

01:47:16.972 --> 01:47:19.432
You guys are such stupid assholes!

01:47:19.599 --> 01:47:22.309
-What are you thinking?!
-Please forgive us. Forgive me.

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:24.645
-Are you crazy?
-Kiss and make up later.

01:47:24.813 --> 01:47:25.938
I don't kiss him!

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:27.314
I got a bullet in me!

01:47:27.482 --> 01:47:30.526
You and I don't kiss! You guys
might kiss, but l don't kiss you!

01:47:31.862 --> 01:47:33.779
I've been shot in the shoulder.

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:35.489
Well, then go to the hospital!

01:47:35.657 --> 01:47:38.367
No! Don't you see? The police
know the Green Hornet was...

01:47:38.535 --> 01:47:39.702
...shot in the shoulder.

01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:42.872
If l go to the hospital,
they'll know l'm the Green Hornet.

01:47:43.039 --> 01:47:44.373
Yeah, you've been shot.

01:47:44.541 --> 01:47:45.791
-Here's what l need.
-What?

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:48.002
Get me a spatula to bite
and a knife.

01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:51.380
You gotta dig this bullet
out of my meat. Do it.

01:47:51.715 --> 01:47:52.882
I'm cold.

01:47:54.843 --> 01:47:56.218
It's deep inside me.

01:47:56.511 --> 01:47:58.345
-Oh, God.
-Spatula.

01:47:59.055 --> 01:48:00.973
Okay, okay. Wait!

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:02.308
-Sterilise it!
-What?

01:48:02.517 --> 01:48:03.559
Sterilise it.

01:48:03.727 --> 01:48:05.144
I don't wanna get gangrene.

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:06.395
Say it, say it.

01:48:07.647 --> 01:48:08.731
Shon-di forever.

01:48:08.899 --> 01:48:11.400
-Here we go, this is hot. Let me see.
-Just wait.

01:48:11.568 --> 01:48:13.360
I'm not ready. Stop, stop, stop.

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.196
Wait, it hurts.

01:48:15.363 --> 01:48:17.490
Okay, l can't do it.
Take me to the hospital.

01:48:17.657 --> 01:48:18.741
Would you just shut up?

01:48:18.909 --> 01:48:20.493
Okay, look, if l'm...

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.913
...the mastermind of this, just let me
have a second of silence...

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.582
...so l can figure this out! Okay?

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.375
Mere hours ago...

01:48:28.543 --> 01:48:31.337
...the Green Hornet and a group
of his criminal underlings...

01:48:31.505 --> 01:48:34.590
...launched a horrendous attack
on this building...

01:48:34.758 --> 01:48:38.302
...that claimed the life of
District Attorney Frank Scanlon.

01:48:38.512 --> 01:48:39.887
It's unfortunate, but...

01:48:40.055 --> 01:48:42.097
...you know, that's what happens.

01:48:42.891 --> 01:48:45.100
The Daily Sentinel will be rebuilt.

01:48:45.685 --> 01:48:47.269
And to start that off...

01:48:47.437 --> 01:48:51.398
...l am naming Mike Axford
the new editor in chief.

01:48:52.108 --> 01:48:54.527
Mike's great and he's
comfortable telling me off...

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:57.029
...so he's the perfect man
for the job.

01:48:57.447 --> 01:49:00.950
We have to get this paper
back to the ideals...

01:49:01.117 --> 01:49:03.702
...that my father started it on.

01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:08.290
I wanna make him proud,
and l hope to...

01:49:08.458 --> 01:49:12.628
...make this city proud of
The Daily Sentinel like never before.

01:49:17.342 --> 01:49:19.468
The Green Hornet
sends his regards.

01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:25.140
He shot me!

01:49:26.268 --> 01:49:27.560
Directly in the shoulder!

01:49:28.645 --> 01:49:30.646
The Green Hornet's sidekick
shot Britt Reid!

01:49:31.147 --> 01:49:32.439
Get me to the hospital!

01:49:32.607 --> 01:49:34.066
He's been shot in the shoulder!

01:49:34.234 --> 01:49:36.569
We gotta get him
to a hospital right away!

01:49:38.488 --> 01:49:39.655
It worked.

01:50:16.901 --> 01:50:18.944
Kato.

01:50:19.195 --> 01:50:19.945
Hey!

01:50:20.196 --> 01:50:22.364
We have a secret mission.
Everything...

01:50:22.532 --> 01:50:24.950
...we've done up till now is
complete and utter crap!

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:26.785
This is all that matters.

01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:28.871
This is it.

01:50:29.331 --> 01:50:30.706
Let's roll, Kato.

01:50:38.548 --> 01:50:39.923
It's crooked.

01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:41.884
He's kind of--

01:50:42.218 --> 01:50:43.886
He's kind of looking....

01:50:44.346 --> 01:50:45.346
Down?

01:50:45.513 --> 01:50:46.722
It's fine.

01:50:46.973 --> 01:50:48.390
Doesn't matter.

01:50:49.059 --> 01:50:50.225
We did it.

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:52.227
We did.

01:50:53.063 --> 01:50:54.730
The Green Hornet.

01:50:54.898 --> 01:50:56.732
His reliable partner...

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.400
...The Blue Wombat.

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:01.362
Oh, man.

01:51:01.738 --> 01:51:05.949
Okay, how about
The Red Hippopotamus?

01:51:06.951 --> 01:51:08.410
No? Not Red Hippopotamus?

01:51:08.578 --> 01:51:10.037
Hippos are not red.

01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:12.373
I know. Hornets aren't green.
Who cares?

01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:15.042
The Orange Albatross.
