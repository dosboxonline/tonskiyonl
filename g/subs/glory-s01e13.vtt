ARTIST LEE SA-RA AT CHURCH
WITH DRUG-RELATED BEHAVIOR

01:12.614 --> 01:14.699
SEEMINGLY INTOXICATED ON VIDEO
FILMED BY CHURCH FOLLOWERS

01:21.039 --> 01:22.248
- Look at this.
- What is it?

01:22.248 --> 01:23.958
EXPOSING WEATHER FORECASTER A
FOR SCHOOL VIOLENCE

01:23.958 --> 01:27.170
- What the hell?
- This whole thing is insane.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.214
How could anyone do something so cruel?

01:30.715 --> 01:32.175
CAUGHT USING DRUGS
BY CHURCH FOLLOWERS

01:36.888 --> 01:38.807
9,411 LIKES

01:40.850 --> 01:42.769
IT'S OBVIOUSLY PARK YEON-JIN
BITCH WHO'LL END UP IN A DITCH

01:46.231 --> 01:47.107
OBVIOUSLY PARK YEON-JIN

01:47.107 --> 01:48.149
SR LEE WAS INFAMOUS IN PARIS

01:48.149 --> 01:49.943
OMG IT'S PARK YEON-JIN
AW CRAP MY STOCKS

02:10.130 --> 02:12.632
Lee Sa-ra, this is the police!

02:12.632 --> 02:15.301
- Oh, shit. Fuck!
- Open the door!]

02:31.025 --> 02:33.069
People everywhere are
starting to talk about the news.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.446
People are.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.329
Hey, what's the point
of having a doctor

02:43.329 --> 02:44.664
if you don't let me help?

02:45.623 --> 02:47.333
Have you been waiting all morning

02:47.333 --> 02:48.626
just to treat my cut?

02:50.962 --> 02:51.796
Come on.

02:52.463 --> 02:53.548
You know how I am.

02:55.008 --> 02:55.884
I was so worried.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.929
A little scratch had you that worried?

02:59.929 --> 03:02.515
Yeah, it did. What, you gonna sue me?

03:05.059 --> 03:06.102
Maybe I should sue.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.688
You didn't want it treated.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.318
Because it's so embarrassing.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.238
Is my mother still calling
and texting you?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.533
Uh, we don't need to talk about that.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.329
We should talk about
all the good things, no?

03:25.079 --> 03:27.332
Have you had breakfast yet?
I can make us something.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.751
Uh, come on now.

03:29.751 --> 03:33.463
- You think my cooking's that bad?
- Hey, don't do that, you know what I mean.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.758
When it rains, your house feels like a cup
someone dropped a fizzy tablet into.

03:36.758 --> 03:40.303
Don't change the subject.
Hey! Put that pan down and talk to me.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.061
She showed up here,
soaked from the rain and shivering.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.437
Then she fell asleep.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.356
I called her mother,
but she couldn't get her.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.191
I was just so worried.

04:05.954 --> 04:06.788
Get up.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.458
Why would you come here?

04:17.131 --> 04:19.092
I had nowhere else to go.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.554
Did you see what's online? About me?

04:26.015 --> 04:27.934
Of course.
So did all my employees.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.857
Do you want to leave me now?

04:37.568 --> 04:39.237
There are more pressing matters.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.406
We're going straight to the office.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.449
The lawyers are on their way.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.120
Thank you, babe.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.289
I have to handle what's most urgent.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.543
I just need to stop
our stocks from crashing.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.963
I don't have time to decide
if I'm leaving you.

05:05.430 --> 05:10.268
THE GLORY

05:10.852 --> 05:14.147
Can you please state definitively
whether or not you are

05:14.147 --> 05:17.108
"Weather Forecaster A"
in this online post?

05:17.108 --> 05:21.070
Do you have any information
about who could have written this post?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.866
Read this carefully,
and point out any facts you can confirm.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.706
Can you prove this is about me?

05:33.541 --> 05:35.043
If you can't prove it...

05:37.045 --> 05:38.254
it's not about me, then.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.550
Are you saying
this post is about someone else?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.135
What do you think?

05:45.803 --> 05:48.890
If we take action, we'll just be putting
a spotlight on this whole thing.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.476
Maybe keeping quiet is the way.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.605
I understand how the public thinks,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.690
better than lawyers.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.824
Get through 48 hours,
and you'll be fine.

06:06.824 --> 06:10.119
Wait for the warrant,
then you can do the urine and hair tests.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.123
Even if you get sentenced,
you'll probably get probation.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.459
So just keep your mouth shut, understand?

06:16.459 --> 06:17.543
I know! Fuck!

06:18.669 --> 06:20.171
I'm the victim here, okay?

06:20.171 --> 06:22.215
Someone else did this to me!

06:22.215 --> 06:24.675
So you need to get
more than these two assholes

06:24.675 --> 06:26.219
to handle this, okay, Dad?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.471
What the fuck were you thinking? Idiot.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.187
Ms. Lee, we'll be conducting a few tests.
We need a urine sample.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.522
You have a warrant?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.441
If you don't have a warrant, no urine.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.279
It seems like you know a lot
for a first-time offender.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.492
I'm not giving you shit. Fuck you.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.417
You wanted me to rush.
I'm surprised you showed up late.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.170
You know, life's unpredictable.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.505
Show me what you found.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.884
Nothing was erased from this.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.970
There's nothing to be examined.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.596
This hard drive is totally new.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.976
What the hell are you talking about?
We've used that hard drive for years.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.853
Maybe somebody swapped it.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.397
If it's erased, you can recover it,
but not if it's swapped out.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.732
What are you trying to find?

07:25.069 --> 07:27.405
<i>Where are you?
Are you free today?</i>

07:27.405 --> 07:29.323
<i>This isn't about Yeon-jin or Sa-ra.</i>

07:29.824 --> 07:32.618
<i>I found out something very interesting
about Myeong-o.</i>

07:33.786 --> 07:35.621
<i>You know that asshole Jae-jun?</i>

07:36.122 --> 07:37.874
I did everything for that bastard.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.294
<i>I drive for him. I keep him company.
I act like I'm his friend.</i>

07:41.794 --> 07:44.964
<i>And you probably know
I didn't go to college.</i>

07:44.964 --> 07:48.384
<i>But I basically went there.
Signed his attendance.</i>

07:48.384 --> 07:52.388
So it really hurts my fucking pride
to only be called a driver.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.724
<i>Get on with it.
You're pissing me off.</i>

07:54.724 --> 07:57.977
This sounds like Myeong-o's
threatening Yeon-jin, doesn't it?

07:58.686 --> 08:01.606
<i>If I were him,
I'd have spent all my time</i>

08:01.606 --> 08:03.524
<i>becoming a director at Jaepyeong,</i>

08:04.025 --> 08:04.984
<i>instead of fucking you.</i>

08:08.321 --> 08:09.155
What?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.657
That's where the recording ends.
It cut out in the middle.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.910
Play it from the beginning. Play it again.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.245
When he's talking about alcohol?

08:21.876 --> 08:23.127
<i>"Pommar-dee"?</i>

08:23.127 --> 08:24.670
Pommard...

08:25.671 --> 08:26.839
What's this?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.720
"Savvy," "Sauvi"...

08:32.720 --> 08:34.347
Fuck, I can't even read this.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.934
Which one's the most expensive?

08:37.934 --> 08:40.436
I'm not gonna drink a fucking cheap one.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.231
Shit, whatever.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.192
Okay.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.944
This one looks pretty good.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.743
Pommard, Sauvignon and Almaviva.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.328
Which one?

08:57.828 --> 09:00.831
I have a dinner tonight. With Do-yeong.

09:06.587 --> 09:07.755
What?

09:12.843 --> 09:14.262
What's going on?

09:15.263 --> 09:18.182
Did that asshole take
a bunch of your booze, too?

09:18.182 --> 09:21.310
Have you played this for anyone else?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.522
Not yet. You're the only one.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.819
Can you raise an eight-year-old?

09:31.779 --> 09:32.947
Are you insane?

09:34.574 --> 09:35.408
Whose kid?

09:39.870 --> 09:40.705
Mine.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.043
You have a child?

09:48.796 --> 09:49.714
Yeah.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.091
But she's with Yeon-jin now.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.176
What are you talking about?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.014
You're talking about Ye-sol? Ha Ye-sol?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.390
<i>Jeon</i> Ye-sol.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.853
What? Join me.

10:09.025 --> 10:12.111
That's an interesting way
to propose to someone.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.698
Why would I not want to raise her?

10:16.198 --> 10:19.619
Of course we should bring her here,
because she's your daughter.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.038
Get in.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.703
You know
you're a fucking asshole, right?

11:03.204 --> 11:04.205
I know.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.377
Are you making kimchi?
Little late this year!

11:09.377 --> 11:12.213
Yeah. I've been so busy recently.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.297
Mm-hmm.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.176
MS. MOON DONG-EUN

11:17.176 --> 11:18.260
Okay.

11:19.762 --> 11:23.766
<i>June 16th, 1987.
1:10 a.m. Yoon So-hee.</i>

11:23.766 --> 11:26.352
That'll be 43,800.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.563
Wait, hold on. Are you wearing makeup?

11:30.272 --> 11:32.608
Oh, no. Did I put on too much?

11:32.608 --> 11:34.610
No!

11:34.610 --> 11:37.363
My husband is getting better.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.284
He wants to stop drinking
and start working harder. I believe him.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.454
Truly? Aw, that's great.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.082
I'm so happy for you. Aw.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.500
Let me tell you something.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.503
He was never my favorite customer,
but I was starting to get worried.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.338
It was weird he stopped showing up.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.092
Where's Sun-a?
I haven't seen her around either.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.510
Where is she?

11:59.510 --> 12:00.845
With my mom.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.389
Is that because of her dad?

12:04.807 --> 12:06.726
That's good. For the best.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.313
Oh, you overpaid! Here.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.816
Uh, I'll just take this, then.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.902
Hey, you don't have to do that! Come on.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.280
You look pretty!
You should wear makeup every day!

12:19.280 --> 12:21.031
Oh, come on, now!

12:21.031 --> 12:22.616
Thanks, have a good night!

12:46.140 --> 12:48.267
<i>Hey, Gyeong-ran.</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:50.519
You gonna keep crying all night long?

12:50.519 --> 12:52.897
Fuck. You're so goddamn loud.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.861
Shh. Girl, if you scream again...

12:58.861 --> 13:01.030
Huh?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.072
Dong-eun?

13:04.950 --> 13:08.496
She must be crazy.
I can't believe she came back here.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.469
You saw me with Myeong-o

13:23.969 --> 13:26.972
when I met him at the boutique.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.098
You recognized me, right?

13:30.100 --> 13:32.520
Water, coffee or booze?

13:35.856 --> 13:36.690
Coffee.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.906
You could have told Yeon-jin you saw me.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.324
Yeah, so?

13:46.909 --> 13:49.829
Just get to the point.
Why are we both here?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.539
You saw the post,

13:52.540 --> 13:53.457
right?

13:55.292 --> 13:57.962
I think we both know
who did that to So-hee.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.924
I came after So-hee.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.718
- And after me it was--
- Shut up.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.140
So what?

14:11.183 --> 14:12.518
You want me to testify?

14:13.102 --> 14:16.480
I don't. I'm asking you
not to do anything.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.191
I've been watching Siesta for a long time.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.819
That's how I know you used to live there.

14:23.821 --> 14:27.908
But on October 20th you moved
to a small apartment across the street.

14:27.908 --> 14:31.579
And that's when Yeon-jin
stopped doing her fittings at Siesta.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.624
At the same time Myeong-o disappeared.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.753
Who cares about that son of a bitch?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.091
Why are you talking to me
about any of this?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.760
Because I think you already know

14:47.887 --> 14:49.054
Son Myeong-o is dead.

14:54.018 --> 14:58.022
It's our chance
to release ourselves from their grip.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.357
So don't get in my way.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.445
No matter what you saw,
what you heard or what you know,

15:06.280 --> 15:07.698
don't do anything.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.743
We both know Myeong-o was...

15:12.119 --> 15:13.787
murdered by Yeon-jin.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.623
Right, Gyeong-ran?

15:26.342 --> 15:29.011
- Hey, man!
- Whoa, look at all this!

15:29.637 --> 15:31.889
Oh, shit! It's "Director Joo" now!

15:31.889 --> 15:34.141
Oh, damn!

15:34.725 --> 15:35.976
Wow.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.896
What do you need this for?
You trying to leave this job?

15:38.896 --> 15:39.980
That'd be crazy!

15:40.481 --> 15:41.565
I'm just looking!

15:42.066 --> 15:43.609
WORKING EXPERIENCE CERTIFICATE

15:44.818 --> 15:46.654
Let's go eat. What food do you want?

15:46.654 --> 15:48.489
Are you crazy? We're getting some beef!

15:48.489 --> 15:51.575
Everyone keeps calling me crazy.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.079
Ah, did I get mail
that got sent to the hospital?

15:55.079 --> 15:57.122
Some people don't have my new one yet.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.917
Come on, you couldn't bring them with you?

16:00.918 --> 16:03.963
Those letters aren't
coming to the hospital anymore,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.339
since the director found out.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.343
My mom found out.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.345
I wondered if she did.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.015
Can you keep this between us?

16:15.015 --> 16:19.228
Just tell me what's going on. What is it?
You really trying to leave this cushy job?

16:19.228 --> 16:22.564
I'll tell you later, huh?
I swear I'll tell you everything later.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.400
Want some drinks? Get day-drunk?

16:24.400 --> 16:25.651
After you, my good sir.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.821
Cheers!

16:28.821 --> 16:29.905
Cheers, man.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.620
Semyeong really is
the perfect place for day drinking.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.579
- Another?
- Okay.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.583
We meet again.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.085
I guess we do.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.461
What's wrong?

18:08.879 --> 18:12.966
Does how I play remind you
of someone you've faced before?

18:18.222 --> 18:21.141
She's good at marking your stones
and protecting hers.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.644
And she's so calm and quiet.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.689
You end up being so entranced,

18:29.566 --> 18:31.902
you don't even realize
your house is ruined.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.741
Hmm.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.410
I learned how to play Go from my father.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.122
It's exactly the way I explained

18:43.705 --> 18:44.748
when I taught Dong-eun.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.001
She said she wanted to beat someone.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.133
So, are you helping her?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.177
I have no reason to stop her.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.138
I don't understand.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.181
What don't you get?

19:01.890 --> 19:03.934
I don't know what the relationship is
between you two,

19:03.934 --> 19:07.896
but if you care about her,
shouldn't you try to stop her?

19:08.814 --> 19:10.399
Whatever she hopes to gain from this

19:10.399 --> 19:14.736
can't be worth
the obsession she has with her past.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.038
When you think about a victim
and everything they lose,

19:26.582 --> 19:29.585
how much can they really expect
to get back in the end?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.091
Maybe just their own honor and glory.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.051
Enough to move on.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.348
Some people get those back
practicing forgiveness,

19:44.057 --> 19:46.226
but others get them through revenge.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.522
And only then
can their lives really start.

19:52.733 --> 19:56.236
Dong-eun's entire life
has been frozen since she was 19.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.246
And I've decided to help Dong-eun
get her life back.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.457
All she really wants...

20:10.834 --> 20:14.129
is to finish what she started
and to finally find some happiness.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.469
Don't misunderstand me.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.350
I also want Dong-eun to find happiness.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.269
I'm glad.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.523
She deserves it.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.155
<i>That's not about Yeon-jin.</i>

20:40.155 --> 20:41.907
You trust some tabloid?

20:42.616 --> 20:44.368
I'm almost home. Talk to you later.

21:01.718 --> 21:05.806
Looks like she just recognized me.

21:15.482 --> 21:19.695
He knows where I live. Oh my God!

21:24.908 --> 21:25.742
NEW MESSAGE

21:26.618 --> 21:28.870
<i>Think your daughter's
only killed one person?</i>

21:28.870 --> 21:30.539
<i>You're wrong. She's killed two.</i>

21:30.539 --> 21:32.499
<i>It was good to see you just now.</i>

21:39.339 --> 21:40.173
Two?

21:44.386 --> 21:46.054
MOM

21:48.557 --> 21:51.393
I'm with the <i>Post Daily</i>.
You're Park Yeon-jin?

21:51.393 --> 21:54.771
- Did you see the post about bullying?
- Some people believe that the "A" is you.

21:54.771 --> 21:55.939
It's not about me.

21:55.939 --> 21:59.484
- Are you formally stating it's not you?
- Will Jaepyeong release a statement?

21:59.484 --> 22:01.486
You graduated from Sunghan High, right?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.697
Did you see the video
of your classmate, Lee Sa-ra?

22:03.697 --> 22:05.157
Please give a statement.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.408
Hey, hey, stop!

22:30.849 --> 22:32.142
Prove it then.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.937
Do you... have some proof?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.899
You have no idea.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.344
What are you doing?

23:13.308 --> 23:16.019
Jae-jun called to ask
about the security camera.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.772
He wants to know
who changed the hard drive and why.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.442
He took it with him
to have it examined by an expert.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.072
You want to change the hard drive?

23:27.072 --> 23:29.241
Please don't make me repeat it to you.

23:29.241 --> 23:33.453
I popped in here yesterday,
and Do-yeong might drop by here soon.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.290
I hear it's better to change it, right?

23:38.458 --> 23:40.377
Do-yeong can just be so meticulous.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.296
I didn't know that.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.924
Well, now you do.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.884
Don't mention this to Jae-jun.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.387
Yeah.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.688
<i>The security footage is gone,
enough time has passed now,</i>

23:59.688 --> 24:01.523
<i>and the body has been buried.</i>

24:01.523 --> 24:04.067
<i>There's no way
that Mr. Shin is going to talk.</i>

24:04.067 --> 24:07.904
<i>No matter what you may have heard,
you can't prove anything, Dong-eun.</i>

24:07.904 --> 24:09.656
What should I tell Jae-jun?

24:10.574 --> 24:12.659
Just say it was me.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.914
Let's do fittings here again.
You should bring my clothes over.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.676
Ms. Kang Hyeon-nam?

24:32.095 --> 24:35.849
June 16, 1987.

24:36.975 --> 24:40.520
What a sad life.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.815
Everything so unfamiliar and strange.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.652
Like a tiny boat floating
on an endless ocean.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.529
This is a heartbreaking life.

24:50.405 --> 24:54.159
Yeah. When she was young,
she was bullied at school very badly.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.537
I must soothe her.
She was born to such a terrible destiny.

24:58.121 --> 25:00.707
This destiny is not yours. Whose is it?

25:02.292 --> 25:05.587
Uh, I guess even a shaman
can't figure that out?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.424
The spirit of the General tells me

25:09.424 --> 25:11.301
to throw out
the ungrateful woman talking back!

25:11.301 --> 25:14.179
Yoon So-hee. This destiny is hers.

25:16.056 --> 25:19.893
Her name is Yoon So-hee,
and she was born in 1987.

25:19.893 --> 25:23.563
Yes, General, show us what you know!

25:25.232 --> 25:27.275
I'm tired.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.906
Oh, I'm so tired and heartbroken.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.660
My job is awful, and my family
is giving me so much trouble.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.247
Be careful with documents this year!
You could get scammed.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.667
Oh wow, you're incredible.

25:44.960 --> 25:49.089
He wants to do it. He wants to do it.
The General wants to perform a ritual.

25:49.089 --> 25:53.260
He's asking for a very,
very big ritual to be performed.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.265
The ritual will have to be very big.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.599
Is that okay?

25:59.599 --> 26:00.684
Of course.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.687
If this changes her destiny,
then I'll do it 100 times.

26:04.187 --> 26:06.439
Do a big ritual. Something massive.

26:15.782 --> 26:16.783
Oh, I'm sorry!

26:17.450 --> 26:19.202
No need to help me. Just go.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.745
Ugh, this is unbelievable.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.372
PERSONAL INFORMATION
LEE SEOK-JAE

26:35.176 --> 26:38.054
- Didn't I read this guy's destiny already?
- Yeah, you did.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.723
I want you to read his face.

26:40.223 --> 26:43.184
Is he really destined for a short life?

26:44.060 --> 26:46.062
- Who is this guy?
- Please, ma'am.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.440
Can we just do a ritual?

26:48.940 --> 26:51.318
I just need you
to give this asshole a push.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.403
I need to go pray. You should go.

26:54.362 --> 26:57.574
I may not be as powerful as I used to be,
but I'll get punished for that.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.284
BEOLJEON: GOD'S DEADLIEST
PUNISHMENT IN KOREAN SHAMANISM

26:59.284 --> 27:00.744
You would've been punished already.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.955
Just think about
all the girls you've pimped out

27:03.955 --> 27:06.625
- while using their destinies as bait.
- Watch it! You're out of line.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.710
Hear me out, I just need a favor.

27:09.502 --> 27:12.255
What about you?
You could use a bigger sanctum, right?

27:12.964 --> 27:16.551
This asshole, he wants me
to give him a billion won.

27:16.551 --> 27:18.720
And so I'm asking you right now

27:18.720 --> 27:22.599
if that billion won should go
to this asshole or go to you.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.267
You said his life is short.

27:25.518 --> 27:28.104
A billion won?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.114
BITCH WHO'LL END UP IN A DITCH

27:44.120 --> 27:45.372
Yes, hello ma'am?

27:45.372 --> 27:47.040
<i>What has Hye-jeong been up to?</i>

27:47.624 --> 27:49.376
She's ghosting me.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.877
Yeah, okay.

27:50.877 --> 27:53.630
For a while now,
she's been seeing someone, you know.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.757
Who are you talking about?

27:56.633 --> 28:00.720
Right. For the last few days,
Hye-jeong has been at Jeon Jae-jun's.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.639
And she goes to work from his place.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.682
Wait, what?

28:03.682 --> 28:04.599
GROOM-TO-BE

28:05.016 --> 28:09.187
<i>Baby, no matter how much I think about it,
I feel like I'm not good enough for you.</i>

28:09.187 --> 28:10.897
<i>But thanks for everything.</i>

28:10.897 --> 28:13.441
<i>I mailed the ring back to you today,
express delivery.</i>

28:13.441 --> 28:16.903
<i>I hope you'll meet someone better than me
and be very happy together.</i>

28:16.903 --> 28:19.239
BLOCK CONTACT

28:26.538 --> 28:27.455
Jun?

28:38.550 --> 28:39.801
So, you are here.

28:41.594 --> 28:43.263
Yeah. What?

28:44.097 --> 28:46.725
I'm with Jae-jun now.
We're getting married.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.143
Good for you.

28:49.352 --> 28:53.356
Tell me why you called me over
to that plastic surgeon's.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.109
Dr. Joo Yeo-jeong. That one.

28:57.777 --> 29:01.030
He's the son of the director
of Joo General Hospital, right?

29:01.990 --> 29:04.242
Is he really? Oh, I had no idea.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.956
Oh, you're right. Same last name.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.752
You think he's working with Dong-eun?

29:15.211 --> 29:17.172
Shouldn't you know that already?

29:19.215 --> 29:21.801
Because you're clearly
working with her too.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.972
She had you get me there, didn't she?

29:28.057 --> 29:29.976
What else has Dong-eun told you to do?

29:31.895 --> 29:36.232
Did you come here just to ask me that?

29:37.317 --> 29:39.861
I'm shocked that that's
what you're worried about...

29:39.861 --> 29:43.406
...when everyone
is tearing you apart online.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.495
- You better watch it.
- Why?

29:49.329 --> 29:51.331
'Cause I'm not under your thumb anymore?

29:52.457 --> 29:55.043
You have no idea what I have planned.

29:55.043 --> 29:55.960
Fuck off.

29:59.380 --> 30:00.215
Fuck off?

30:00.215 --> 30:02.300
Jae-jun's been ghosting you, right?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.471
You should wake the fuck up, Yeon-jin.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.141
Because there's a reason
Jae-jun is ignoring you.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.858
I bought him this shirt.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.236
It looks better on him.

30:29.118 --> 30:31.371
Here, all yours. We done?

30:35.708 --> 30:37.544
That's a nice boob job.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.972
JONGNO POLICE STATION

30:48.972 --> 30:51.140
- Can I have a hair tie?
- Yeah. Here.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.101
Ugh. Fuck.

30:53.601 --> 30:54.853
My scalp's so itchy.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.731
You look like you're on
some American TV show,

30:58.731 --> 30:59.816
with that blonde hair.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.901
It's as brassy as these bars.

31:02.485 --> 31:03.987
Shut the fuck up, huh?

31:04.904 --> 31:06.072
Where's everyone else?

31:06.072 --> 31:08.533
They're not gonna come, honey.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.452
- Yeon-jin, for sure.
- Why won't she come?

31:12.245 --> 31:13.329
You don't know?

31:14.622 --> 31:17.292
Right, you were too busy getting arrested.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.169
Hey bitch, cut to the chase.
What are you talking about?

31:20.169 --> 31:24.507
Someone exposed Yeon-jin,
but it got buried by a story about you.

31:25.508 --> 31:30.013
An article about your art exhibition
being used for tax evasion.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.392
It's too perfect to be a coincidence.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.645
It's like she used you to bury her story.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.362
Excuse me,
can I photograph some pieces?

31:46.362 --> 31:48.197
It'll only take a moment, okay?

31:50.742 --> 31:52.076
Come on, let's go.

31:56.748 --> 32:00.001
Sorry I missed your text, ma'am.
Here's money for my HOA fees.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.880
I was beginning to think you ran away.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.758
I've only been seeing your mother
at your place.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.509
There have been several noise complaints.

32:12.639 --> 32:16.684
Can I ask you why,
when my mother first came looking for me...

32:17.268 --> 32:20.021
Why didn't you tell her
that I was living there?

32:24.359 --> 32:27.111
I think that there should be
at least one person on your side.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.116
Families can be complicated.

32:32.116 --> 32:35.036
They say that families
are determined by the heavens.

32:35.036 --> 32:39.415
That said, you shouldn't try
to shoulder all that burden by yourself.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.754
And sometimes,
even the heavens can make mistakes.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.257
Don't be late next month.

MEDICAL OFFICER KIM JIN-HUN

34:00.747 --> 34:02.081
Asshole.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.583
How long has it been, man?

34:04.959 --> 34:07.545
It's been three years
since I was a medical officer.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.629
Salute.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.339
So, how have you been?

34:10.339 --> 34:13.843
Well, how do you think I've been?
I spend all day with scary people.

34:14.761 --> 34:18.014
Still, you're by far
the scariest guy that I've seen this year.

34:21.934 --> 34:23.186
Give me the papers.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.605
I've covered all my bases.

34:26.564 --> 34:29.025
But it's still probably going to need
a little nudge from you.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.570
When I first met you,

34:32.570 --> 34:34.989
I figured the whole world
must feel like your playground.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.325
Must be nice to buy houses and cars

34:37.325 --> 34:39.827
like you're running
to the convenience store for milk.

34:41.704 --> 34:45.666
So, when a guy like you
called me looking for a job,

34:45.666 --> 34:47.168
I'll admit I was surprised.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.630
Well, thank you again
for putting in a good word for me.

34:50.630 --> 34:54.759
- When are you leaving the country?
- I'll leave after I train my replacement.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.555
Your application might get rejected.

35:00.306 --> 35:03.893
I heard it's up to the warden to decide,
but they're short-staffed.

35:04.852 --> 35:07.105
You know, his case is pretty infamous.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.524
And the warden definitely knows.

35:10.399 --> 35:11.400
It has to be me.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.736
I'm finally continuing my father's work.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.822
Joo Yeo-jeong?

35:17.657 --> 35:18.574
Doctor Joo?

35:36.843 --> 35:39.303
<i>Even now,
that day remains in my memory,</i>

35:39.303 --> 35:41.097
<i>vivid as if it were yesterday.</i>

35:41.848 --> 35:44.350
<i>The scent of his blood in my nostrils.</i>

35:45.893 --> 35:48.980
<i>That slicing sound
as the knife pierced his throat.</i>

35:50.773 --> 35:53.526
<i>The heat of his blood
as it dripped down my hands.</i>

35:54.527 --> 35:58.072
<i>And even the look on his face
as the life left his eyes.</i>

36:02.201 --> 36:03.786
You know who I am, Dr. Joo?

36:07.456 --> 36:09.208
I'm a little hurt you never wrote back.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.379
Of course I know you.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.800
You're the reason
that my entire life is a living hell.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.055
I knew you'd recognize me
when we met again.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.645
This place is nice.

36:30.646 --> 36:31.898
But it's so boring.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.661
I have a question for you.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.625
Why'd you do it?

36:52.585 --> 36:56.172
You said you remember everything
so vividly, like it happened yesterday.

36:57.673 --> 37:00.009
Why did you kill the man
who saved your life?

37:00.760 --> 37:01.761
How can you...

37:04.013 --> 37:05.598
How can you live with yourself?

37:18.110 --> 37:20.613
Oh, I'm having so much fun.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.786
Will we see each other again?

37:31.499 --> 37:33.501
3724, back away from the fence now.

37:34.293 --> 37:35.878
No talking to visitors.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.546
Back away!

37:43.803 --> 37:45.054
I'll see you again.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.057
And next time I do,

37:49.600 --> 37:51.602
I'll show you the hell that is my life.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.063
And then after that,

37:55.731 --> 37:58.567
I'll introduce you
to the hell that you'll be living in.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.237
Until that day comes...

38:04.031 --> 38:04.907
take care of yourself.

38:29.098 --> 38:31.517
We won't have any time
to drink that coffee.

38:31.517 --> 38:35.146
The shaman said it would only work
if we do it at the time she told us.

38:37.189 --> 38:38.899
You should dry your hair.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.359
What are you doing?

38:42.486 --> 38:43.696
Hey!

38:43.696 --> 38:45.114
What do you want in life?

38:46.407 --> 38:47.241
What the fuck?

38:47.241 --> 38:48.492
Whatever you want,

38:49.535 --> 38:51.746
make sure you leave me out of it
from now on.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.039
And you should buy a new phone.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.251
Listen, man.

38:57.251 --> 38:58.252
NAMYANGJU LOTTERY SHOP

38:58.252 --> 39:01.756
I made the shaman's work effective!
I blocked your evil energy!

39:01.756 --> 39:02.673
Yeah, what?

39:07.470 --> 39:08.471
On my way.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.224
"Blocking evil energy," my ass!

39:13.768 --> 39:15.853
It was sold? The funeral home?

39:16.645 --> 39:17.480
To who? And when?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.940
Oh, I really have no idea.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.526
They only told me after the deal was done.

39:23.569 --> 39:24.945
Anyway, about that body.

39:24.945 --> 39:26.989
You should probably
take care of it pretty soon.

39:30.576 --> 39:31.702
Hey.

39:33.412 --> 39:34.914
Are you serious right now?

39:36.165 --> 39:37.875
How's your business nowadays?

39:38.376 --> 39:40.378
- Lot of customers?
- What?

39:43.923 --> 39:45.508
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

39:45.508 --> 39:49.053
Sure, uh, all thanks to you.
Thanks for your concern.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.471
Yeah, that's right.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.890
That's all that you had to say.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.060
Did you say anything else?

39:56.560 --> 39:59.146
Of course not!
Because I'd get in trouble too.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.527
<i>I told him what you told me to say.</i>

40:04.527 --> 40:06.320
I'm just working
till the end of this month,

40:06.320 --> 40:08.614
so now obviously
they're going to have to get rid of it.

40:08.614 --> 40:12.118
Okay, good work.
Call me when you get their schedule.

40:40.980 --> 40:41.981
Ah.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.569
Which recipe did you use to make this?

40:46.569 --> 40:48.737
The one at the top of the search results.

40:48.737 --> 40:50.322
Of course you did.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.630
Where'd you go today?

41:09.091 --> 41:10.176
Somewhere far.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.596
Let me look at that cut.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.146
If we had met

41:23.439 --> 41:25.399
under other circumstances,

41:25.399 --> 41:26.901
in a different situation,

41:28.444 --> 41:30.112
what would our relationship be like?

41:34.366 --> 41:35.534
Exactly the same.

41:37.203 --> 41:40.623
I would have fallen for you,
no matter how we met each other.

41:42.374 --> 41:43.459
Ninety-nine percent.

41:45.294 --> 41:46.879
Why leave out 1%?

41:48.714 --> 41:50.382
'Cause it couldn't get
any better than this.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.099
Hmm. It's healing perfectly.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.909
I'm holding you hostage.

42:18.410 --> 42:20.079
Say that the noodles were good.

42:24.208 --> 42:28.128
There's no way I'd say it wasn't good
when I know how hard you're trying.

43:10.004 --> 43:11.922
Are you going somewhere, Ms. Moon?

43:13.132 --> 43:14.133
Ha Ye-sol.

43:16.135 --> 43:19.972
If you need me to,
I will apologize to you

43:20.723 --> 43:21.974
until the day that I die.

43:23.350 --> 43:24.518
Why?

43:26.061 --> 43:27.730
Because you truly deserve

43:29.315 --> 43:30.482
an apology.

43:34.236 --> 43:35.237
Goodbye, Ye-sol.

44:05.517 --> 44:08.187
Good work, Mom.
You did it. You got what you wanted.

44:09.021 --> 44:10.439
I quit my job at the school.

44:10.939 --> 44:13.025
I'm coming over, and I want you out.

44:18.697 --> 44:20.199
Excuse me, Ms. Park?

44:20.199 --> 44:21.992
I'm not doing interviews.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.494
I'm from the police.

44:31.877 --> 44:33.295
You're hard to get ahold of.

44:33.921 --> 44:37.132
I know you check your text messages,
but you never returned my calls.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.593
How can I help the police?

44:39.593 --> 44:42.471
The night of October 19th,
can you tell me where you were?

44:44.723 --> 44:46.141
<i>A detective came,</i>

44:46.141 --> 44:48.143
asking about October 19th.

44:48.143 --> 44:49.061
HONG YEONG-AE

44:49.061 --> 44:51.814
I told him I was broadcasting,
but what do I do now?

44:52.523 --> 44:54.608
Did you know
they were starting an investigation?

44:54.608 --> 44:57.695
You didn't check, did you?
Can you stop this or what?

44:59.738 --> 45:00.572
No.

45:01.990 --> 45:02.825
No, I can't.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.830
What the hell have you been doing?

45:08.414 --> 45:09.289
Are you done?

45:10.499 --> 45:12.584
For one second, let's not talk about you.

45:15.504 --> 45:16.797
I'm retiring.

45:18.006 --> 45:20.592
I want to move somewhere warm
and play golf all day.

45:20.592 --> 45:22.678
I've heard Hawaii's pretty cool.

45:25.097 --> 45:27.975
You decided to retire? In this mess?

45:27.975 --> 45:29.393
Messy as it is,

45:30.477 --> 45:32.479
I can retire on someone else's dime now.

45:39.945 --> 45:41.947
Why should I leave, huh?

45:42.948 --> 45:44.616
I'm not going anywhere!

45:45.242 --> 45:49.246
Try to make me leave,
you fucking bitch! Try!

45:49.747 --> 45:51.623
Why the hell did you quit your job?

45:51.623 --> 45:55.335
You could have made so much money
if you just held out!

45:56.587 --> 45:58.213
Do whatever the fuck you want,

45:58.213 --> 46:01.884
because you could never be
a teacher anyways.

46:01.884 --> 46:04.094
Fuck you, you stupid bitch.

46:05.137 --> 46:09.850
And I see you. I see the way
you look at my boyfriend.

46:09.850 --> 46:14.521
How dare you try
to steal my man, you bitch!

46:14.521 --> 46:19.026
He left because he's a nice guy,
way better than you deserve.

46:19.026 --> 46:21.111
But I swear if you were anyone else,

46:21.111 --> 46:25.240
I would've slapped you across the face.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.785
God, I never should have had you.

46:27.785 --> 46:31.205
Everyone told me to get an abortion,

46:31.205 --> 46:34.124
but I gave birth to you anyway,

46:34.124 --> 46:37.002
and I gave you everything!

46:37.503 --> 46:39.505
I'm sorry!

46:40.130 --> 46:41.673
I'm sorry!

46:42.800 --> 46:46.053
I'm just a terrible fucking sinner!

46:49.223 --> 46:52.935
You're the one who destroyed
our relationship for a little bit of cash.

46:52.935 --> 46:53.852
Get out!

46:53.852 --> 46:57.064
Fuck you, you little fucking whore!

46:57.648 --> 46:59.274
I should've killed you.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.612
Kill me! Do it!

47:04.404 --> 47:07.825
That's the only shot you have
at ever controlling me again.

47:20.629 --> 47:25.133
I think you're scared of the fire,
aren't you?

47:26.635 --> 47:28.887
I want a house in Hawaii and some cash.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.057
From the kindness of your heart,
of course. It's only fair.

47:33.267 --> 47:37.563
Since I'm not quite retirement age,
I need a healthy retirement package.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.944
What makes you think
I'm actually going to do that for you?

47:46.488 --> 47:47.990
Because Son Myeong-o's body

47:49.157 --> 47:50.659
hasn't been buried yet.

47:53.787 --> 47:55.038
What are you saying?

47:55.038 --> 47:58.208
<i>71-1 Seonghan-dong,
Jongno-gu. An unidentified body ...</i>

47:58.208 --> 47:59.126
Let's go.

47:59.126 --> 48:02.379
<i>I repeat, a body has been found.
We need an officer at the scene.</i>

48:02.379 --> 48:04.089
<i>Unit One is en route.</i>

48:33.160 --> 48:35.037
I'll never fucking forgive you.

48:41.752 --> 48:42.878
REASON FOR WITHDRAWAL:
MALADJUSTMENT

48:42.878 --> 48:44.671
<i>And the reason
I'll never forgive you...</i>

48:44.671 --> 48:45.631
GUARDIAN: JEONG MI-HEE

48:47.466 --> 48:49.760
...is because you still can't see

48:50.636 --> 48:53.096
that you were the first person
who betrayed me!

48:57.935 --> 49:01.271
Don't laugh. Don't laugh at me.

49:01.813 --> 49:03.482
Stop fucking laughing!

49:04.650 --> 49:07.319
What are you gonna do if I keep laughing?

49:08.195 --> 49:09.655
Okay!

49:09.655 --> 49:11.406
I have an idea.

49:12.199 --> 49:15.077
You and I should die
in this shithole together,

49:15.077 --> 49:17.204
right now!

49:17.204 --> 49:20.248
Here! How's this, you bitch?

49:36.765 --> 49:38.350
Tell me that you're sorry.

49:40.102 --> 49:44.690
Beg me to forgive you! Do it!

49:44.690 --> 49:46.274
Right now!

49:54.199 --> 49:55.784
I wanna thank you, Mom.

49:57.244 --> 49:58.870
Don't ever change.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.875
You'll always be the same.

50:04.710 --> 50:06.628
You'll always be my mom.
