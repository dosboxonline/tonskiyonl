WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.463
We are having a baby.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.675
Morning, Shaun.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.177
Were you watching me sleep?

00:11.261 --> 00:12.262
Yes.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.346
Hmm.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.098
We are having a baby.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.810
Mm.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.812
And that baby is making me feel

00:20.895 --> 00:23.440
like I ate three-month-old sushi.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.192
[sighs]

00:26.276 --> 00:28.737
Good morning, Berry.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.197
Why are you making Mommy feel this way?

00:31.781 --> 00:34.159
Are we naming it Berry?

00:34.784 --> 00:37.996
For now,
because he's the size of a blueberry.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.498
I can just picture your face

00:40.582 --> 00:43.793
on a little blueberry-sized baby.

00:45.086 --> 00:49.340
At week seven, the fetus has developed
webbed hands and feet,

00:49.424 --> 00:51.926
and you have started to form a mucus plug.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.596
Ooh, your breath is killing me, Shaun.

00:56.222 --> 01:01.186
I brushed my teeth twice
because I thought we might have sex.

01:01.269 --> 01:04.355
The mint from the…
The toothpaste is, um…

01:04.439 --> 01:07.150
It's… Mm-mm.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.276
[sniffs]

01:13.031 --> 01:15.408
Stop smirking like
you're picturing me naked.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.452
Don't have to picture it. Saw it already.

01:17.535 --> 01:20.246
You're running a little late.
Did I keep you up too long last night?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.372
Don't flatter yourself.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.458
I'm not late, and it wasn't that long.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.795
What are you doing?

01:28.004 --> 01:29.339
Shielding us from the rain.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.257
What do you think this is, <i>The Notebook?</i>

01:31.341 --> 01:33.760
It's raining, and I shared my umbrella.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.014
Having sex doesn't make us a thing.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.183
We need to make clear boundaries.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.352
I don't need romantic gestures from you.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.479
I shared my umbrella. I didn't propose.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.314
But I hear your message loud and clear.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.149
You hate me, I hate you.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.234
See you tonight?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.488
[doorbell rings]

01:55.740 --> 01:56.825
Can I help you?

01:58.034 --> 01:59.119
Hello, Claire.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.286
My name's Miles Browne.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.371
I'm…

02:02.622 --> 02:03.832
your father.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.212
What are you doing here?

02:09.879 --> 02:11.965
I've owed you a lot of answers
for a long time, and…

02:12.048 --> 02:13.466
Go home.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.969
Um, whoa. I just, uh…

02:18.221 --> 02:21.349
Well… Well, I wish I… I was a… A better…

02:22.725 --> 02:25.019
Um, uh…

02:25.103 --> 02:27.856
I don't want you to…

02:27.939 --> 02:29.274
[stammers]

02:29.357 --> 02:30.817
Can you lift your arms?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.277
-Uh…
-Keep them up.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.529
Okay. Repeat after me.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.364
"Don't cry over spilled milk."

02:36.447 --> 02:37.991
D-Don't…

02:38.074 --> 02:39.075
F-fry…

02:39.159 --> 02:40.326
-[breathing shakily]
-Oh.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.496
We need to get you to the hospital.
I think you're having a stroke.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.416
[theme music playing]

02:54.716 --> 02:56.551
The quickstep is my nemesis.

02:56.634 --> 02:59.178
I lost my footing and landed
on a 90-year-old judge

02:59.262 --> 03:01.014
with very sharp elbows.

03:01.097 --> 03:04.767
And he insisted I come in
even though I'm fine.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.352
Just a little sore.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.856
Yeah, but Maya's "a little sore"
is a normal person's excruciating.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.150
Take the compliment, babe.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.319
You're shivering.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.488
The abdomen is tense and distended.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.656
She's hypotensive.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.033
We need to do an ultrasound

03:20.116 --> 03:21.993
to check for acute abdominal injury.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.077
I'm fine.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.372
When did you start feeling lightheaded?

03:27.582 --> 03:29.042
[Maya] About an hour ago.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.753
There is significant pressure
in the abdominal contents.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.339
What does that mean?

03:34.422 --> 03:36.507
She has a retroperitoneal bleed.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.927
We need to get you
into surgery right away.

03:45.767 --> 03:46.976
Hi, Mr. Browne.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.228
I'm Dr. Allen.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.312
This is Dr. Park.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.396
How are you feeling?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.481
Much better.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.524
I see where Claire gets her good looks.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.654
BP looks good. 124 over 83.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.864
Have you had these symptoms before?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.950
Happens sometimes when I get migraines.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.410
Migraines come when I'm stressed.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.872
Don't cry over spilled milk.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.045
Look, I don't want to take up
too much of your time,

04:14.128 --> 04:16.756
but is it possible we can
go somewhere quiet and talk?

04:17.215 --> 04:19.634
Maybe we could grab a coffee or dessert.

04:19.717 --> 04:22.262
You know, you used to love
rocky road ice cream.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.055
Is that still your favorite flavor?

04:24.138 --> 04:26.099
You just had a major neurological event.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.726
We need to run some CT scans
to identify the cause.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.439
[Dr. Andrews] Found the bleeder. Clamp.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.234
Need to open up the retroperitoneal space
and pack.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.402
BP's still dropping.

04:37.485 --> 04:41.030
She's not clotting. She have any history
of hemophilia or bleeding disorder?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.866
-No.
-Push FFP, TXA and fibrinogen.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.327
Pack more lap pads
and evacuate the hematoma.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.538
[monitor beeping rapidly]

04:53.501 --> 04:54.502
[rapid beeping]

04:54.585 --> 04:55.795
[Asher] Pressure's rising.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.630
[monitor beeping steadily]

05:01.467 --> 05:03.678
This young lady almost died

05:03.761 --> 05:05.346
from a collision with an elbow.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.473
There must be something else
going on here.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.058
Find out what it is.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.241
We'll start by scanning your abdomen.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.743
I'll help you up on the bed.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.330
[Miles] You were right.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.290
[over intercom] <i>It wasn't a migraine.</i>

05:36.169 --> 05:38.004
I have terminal cancer.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.890
His oncologist started him on chemo.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.309
It shrunk the tumor,
but Miles didn't finish it.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.312
The location of the metastases
still likely leaves it inoperable.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.480
[Jordan] I don't know.

05:55.563 --> 05:58.066
If we use transcatheter
hepatic artery chemoembolization,

05:58.149 --> 06:00.985
we might be able to attack
the tumor and spare his liver.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.864
Claire? What do you think?

06:07.909 --> 06:09.744
It's the patient's decision.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.788
You should take it to him.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.081
Let him decide.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.835
[door opens]

06:18.836 --> 06:21.089
You have abnormally large platelets.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.800
It's a rare condition called
Bernard-Soulier syndrome,

06:23.883 --> 06:26.302
which makes it very difficult
for your blood to clot.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.554
It's why you almost bled out
during surgery.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.348
[Leo] Is it treatable?
Will she be okay?

06:30.431 --> 06:32.600
There's no cure, but it is manageable.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.103
Keep an eye out for pain or bruising

06:35.186 --> 06:37.105
or any other symptoms that don't go away.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.273
That can be a sign of a larger problem.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.942
It's just a pulled muscle.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.235
You don't know that.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.572
My left leg has been
bothering me for a few weeks.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.740
[Leo] Months.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.536
I'm not overreacting.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.210
We'll need to run CTs
of your hip and femur

06:59.293 --> 07:02.046
to rule out osteoarthritis
or an occult fracture.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.595
-How does that feel?
-Weird.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.310
-Oh.
-Better?

07:16.394 --> 07:17.395
Sure.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.729
Why do I need this?

07:18.813 --> 07:21.566
Back pain is a common symptom
of pregnancy.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.192
It's preventative.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.903
You should take these twice
a day with food or milk,

07:25.987 --> 07:27.238
preferably food.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.823
I already have prenatal vitamins.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.658
You have the chewable gummy kind.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.577
Tablets are better for the fetus.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.370
Will you please stop calling it a fetus?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.247
It is a fetus.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.540
It's our baby.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.044
I don't need you
to do any of this, Shaun.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.424
What do you need me to do?

07:46.507 --> 07:50.011
Just be the dad, not the doctor.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.311
Do you think I'm gonna drink this?

07:58.394 --> 07:59.395
What's in it?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.898
Urine? Saliva? Tropical fish?

08:02.356 --> 08:03.357
Coffee.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.777
Dr. Park, need to talk to you
about our implant patient.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.155
Let's do an additional
split-thickness skin graft.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.240
That's a pretty long
and complicated procedure.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.285
If you're gonna scrub in, you'll need
the caffeine more than I do.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.913
I hear you've been keeping
some pretty late nights.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.834
Too much caffeine before surgery
leads to unsteady hands.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.544
I can assure you, I'm well-rested.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.463
I don't need the coffee.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.228
Your father refused surgery.

08:43.439 --> 08:46.150
His slurred speech
was a side effect of chemo.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.860
Treatment almost took him out.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.612
He doesn't want to try again.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.907
Thanks for letting me know.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.376
I know a lot of girls
who didn't have their fathers,

09:04.168 --> 09:06.462
but yours did something theirs didn't.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.881
He came back.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.176
[chuckles] He came back
to absolve himself of guilt.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.719
It's a gift I'm not giving him.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.596
That's his burden to carry.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.224
Forgiveness isn't for the one
you're forgiving.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.351
It's for you.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.689
[cell phone beeps]

09:24.772 --> 09:26.399
[gasps] It's Miles.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.900
His liver's bleeding.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.612
Go.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.539
[machine whirring]

09:44.250 --> 09:46.502
They seem like a very nice couple.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.796
Very… Connected.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.050
I wish I knew how to be like that.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.387
They're not a couple.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.931
Leo's gay.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.019
Can gay people really detect
other gay people?

10:03.728 --> 10:06.105
You can if you check out
their Instagram.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.317
Dr. Murphy…

10:10.401 --> 10:12.111
I don't think she has arthritis,

10:12.194 --> 10:13.821
but I don't know what this is.

10:16.532 --> 10:20.494
Her disorder caused blood-filled
pseudotumors in her leg.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.123
The blood ate away her bone.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.755
[Jordan] Your liver was bleeding

10:30.838 --> 10:33.174
because your tumor
exceeded its blood supply.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.302
It puts you at risk
for serious complications,

10:37.011 --> 10:38.429
even a fatal one.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.932
Please reconsider the surgery.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.851
I'm not afraid of dying.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.731
Where's my daughter?
Why isn't she here telling me any of this?

10:48.814 --> 10:50.608
[monitor beeping]

10:58.866 --> 11:00.785
I think it's time for me to go home.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.705
What about 3-D-printed scaffolding?

11:04.789 --> 11:07.541
We could re-create the shape of the bone,
graft new stem cells,

11:07.625 --> 11:10.252
and allograft onto it
to generate new growth.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.422
Her underlying disorder
would eat away the new bone.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.926
Everything I do upsets Lea
and makes her mad at me.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.263
Oh. That's what I'm doing here,
I'm guessing?

11:21.347 --> 11:22.890
Mm-hmm. Yes.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.768
You're both here
because I have two questions.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.062
When I tell my patient
her femur bone is destroyed,

11:28.145 --> 11:29.980
she is going to ask if I can save her leg,

11:30.064 --> 11:31.732
and I don't have an answer to that.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.402
Lea and I are in love.
We're going to have a baby.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.570
We should feel very happy right now,

11:36.654 --> 11:38.572
but I feel like I'm living with a stranger

11:38.656 --> 11:41.492
who doesn't want me to breathe on them.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.495
We could do an expandable
osseointegrated limb replacement.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.705
-Too risky.
-Too many surgeries, yeah.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.334
Well, you're gonna have a kid, Shaun.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.671
You… You can't expect
everything to be the same.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.506
Lea's going through
a whole lot of changes.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.882
You both are.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.592
N-No, I'm the same.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.469
Well, maybe that's the problem, Shaun.

12:00.553 --> 12:04.140
You're in a relationship
with three people now.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.267
You're gonna have to
make some adjustments.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.571
He used to pick me up
every day after school.

13:04.492 --> 13:07.995
And then, one day,
he just stopped showing up.

13:10.247 --> 13:13.292
And for years after, I would come home,

13:13.375 --> 13:17.213
I'd make sure the curtains were open,

I'd imagine it was him
coming to grab me up and rescue me,

he'd come back.

of major complication during surgery,

27:27.729 --> 27:30.148
which will make me
feel sad and scared.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.569
And if I can hear it, I will feel happy.

27:36.071 --> 27:40.492
And either way,
you will probably feel nothing.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.622
And that'll make me feel
more alone than I already do,

27:45.705 --> 27:48.541
so you should just not come.

27:52.962 --> 27:53.963
Okay.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.975
[monitor beeping]

28:49.144 --> 28:50.979
[monitor beeping]

28:52.856 --> 28:57.110
Isn't it possible Leo loves Maya
as much as she loves him?

28:57.193 --> 29:00.488
Does it matter that he doesn't
want to have sex with her?

29:00.572 --> 29:01.948
Sex isn't just about sex.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.785
It's about intimacy and desire

29:05.869 --> 29:08.830
and a deep mutual physical connection.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.750
And she thinks she has that.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.629
That's the last of the proximal femur.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.215
Let's get the distal end out.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.803
[Shaun] Maybe Maya and Leo have
such a strong relationship

29:23.887 --> 29:26.973
because it's based entirely
on an emotional connection.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.018
[monitor beeping rapidly]

29:30.101 --> 29:31.561
[Asher] She's hypotensive.

29:31.644 --> 29:34.105
[Shaun] There are secretions
around her breathing tube,

29:34.189 --> 29:35.690
and her oxygen levels are dropping.

29:35.774 --> 29:36.983
She's rejecting the platelets.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.526
[Dr. Andrews] Stop the transfusion.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.779
Increase her oxygen
and respiratory support.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.697
Start dopamine and epinephrine.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.617
[rapid beeping]

29:45.700 --> 29:48.995
BP's 87 over 52. She's stabilizing.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.872
But without the transfusions,

29:50.955 --> 29:53.249
her risk of bleeding out goes way up.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.378
Are we going to move forward or amputate?

29:57.462 --> 29:59.798
[monitor beeping steadily]

29:59.881 --> 30:01.299
Her partner's her proxy, right?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.303
He's got a decision to make.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.228
My God.

30:16.689 --> 30:17.690
[sniffles]

30:19.818 --> 30:22.070
She trusted me to protect her wishes.

30:22.904 --> 30:23.988
And she wants to dance.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.534
Y-You should try to save her leg.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.459
Maya's in love with you.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.546
That's why she's having the surgery.

30:39.629 --> 30:43.466
She thinks if she loses dance,
your relationship will end.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.803
And only you know if she's right.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.722
If she is…

30:49.806 --> 30:52.725
If losing her leg means
losing the two things she loves most,

30:52.809 --> 30:54.853
then maybe you should
honor her wishes.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.313
But if she's wrong…

30:58.273 --> 31:01.609
If you do love her
and will stay with her no matter what,

31:02.318 --> 31:04.946
then you should do whatever
it takes to save her life.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.614
Of course I love her.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.868
There's no question that I love her.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.787
[sighs] So, the only question is…

31:14.581 --> 31:15.790
How much?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.253
[door closes]

31:20.336 --> 31:21.754
Miles is stable.

31:23.006 --> 31:29.637
But we found significant
polyp burden not detected on his CT,

31:29.721 --> 31:31.139
and we sent to biopsies.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.644
His cancer was caused
by familial adenomatous polyposis.

31:37.854 --> 31:38.771
That's genetic.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.816
50% chance of carrying the gene

31:41.900 --> 31:43.943
if you have an affected parent.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.653
You need to get a genetic test.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.615
Even if you have the gene,

31:48.698 --> 31:51.075
with regular colonoscopies,
we'll be able to catch it…

31:51.159 --> 31:52.368
Thank you.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.416
[door closes]

31:58.499 --> 31:59.500
[sighs]

32:02.045 --> 32:03.046
What's this?

32:03.129 --> 32:04.130
Male, late 20s.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.299
Needs bilateral carpal tunnel
release surgery

32:06.382 --> 32:10.345
that he got playing
in the United States Chess Federation.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.973
You like to play chess with Kellan.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.309
Your game sucks.
Figured you might learn something.

32:22.065 --> 32:25.026
This is you being a decent human.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.448
Maybe sometimes it's not terrible.

32:31.741 --> 32:34.160
This is delightful.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.746
I can give it to someone else.

32:36.829 --> 32:37.830
Thanks.

32:47.006 --> 32:50.426
Are you glad you went to see
your father before he died?

32:50.510 --> 32:51.552
No.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.637
My father hurt me.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.515
He was a bad man who did bad things.

32:55.598 --> 32:57.266
I already knew that.

32:57.350 --> 33:01.145
My father hurt me, too…
By leaving me.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.647
[sighs]

33:02.730 --> 33:04.565
He didn't even try to be a good dad.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.196
How can you be sure he didn't?

33:11.322 --> 33:14.158
Maybe he did try and he couldn't.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.119
[scoffs]

33:16.202 --> 33:20.289
Well, if something is important to you,
you make it happen.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.624
But what if you can't?

33:23.459 --> 33:26.421
What if you're trying
to connect with your child

33:28.423 --> 33:29.841
and it just doesn't work?

33:34.929 --> 33:37.932
It is difficult to feel something

33:38.016 --> 33:40.435
for someone you don't know yet.

33:45.648 --> 33:48.484
Do you want to know
what kind of man your father is?

34:00.163 --> 34:02.665
Why… Why would you do this to me?

34:04.375 --> 34:07.211
[voice breaking]
I told you I was willing to take the risk.

34:09.255 --> 34:10.256
I wasn't.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.721
I love you. I couldn't risk your life.

34:16.804 --> 34:17.889
I'm so sorry.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.974
-But I'm here.
-[sniffles]

34:20.058 --> 34:21.684
I'm not going anywhere.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.561
You're not gonna lose me.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.025
We're gonna get through this, My.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.361
We'll be okay.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.615
[sobs]

34:37.950 --> 34:39.952
I sleep all the time and I'm still tired.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.829
When was your last bowel movement?

34:41.913 --> 34:43.122
I don't know. A couple days.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.918
Shaun, what are you doing here?

34:49.045 --> 34:51.005
-[Shaun] Smile.
-Uh, what?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.507
There is something in your teeth.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.591
Shaun.

34:55.134 --> 34:57.011
Do you eat a lot of black licorice?

34:57.095 --> 34:59.055
-Uh, yes.
-You should stop.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.516
Eating too much black licorice
can lower potassium,

35:01.599 --> 35:03.601
which causes fatigue and constipation.

35:03.684 --> 35:04.685
Stop eating it.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.104
That's it?

35:06.187 --> 35:07.188
Yes.

35:13.486 --> 35:16.364
Lea doesn't want me
at her OB-GYN appointment.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.742
There's a woman in the waiting room
with a very interesting mole.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.124
The year Maddie was born,

35:26.207 --> 35:28.417
I took on twice as many surgeries.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.420
I… [laughs] I hid at the hospital.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.132
I was afraid that I was
gonna piss off my wife.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.216
Sound familiar?

35:35.299 --> 35:36.968
Upset my daughter.

35:37.051 --> 35:39.053
I thought you liked being a dad.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.221
I did. I…

35:40.763 --> 35:43.599
I just didn't think
I was very good at it. I…

35:44.308 --> 35:47.103
It didn't come naturally to me. Not like…

35:47.603 --> 35:48.813
Not like brain surgery.

35:50.439 --> 35:51.649
I missed a lot.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.321
Sometimes I think
if I had been there for the swaddling

35:57.405 --> 35:59.615
and for the changing
of the diapers and…

36:02.660 --> 36:04.495
See her first steps, you know?

36:07.582 --> 36:08.708
[sighs]

36:09.417 --> 36:11.043
Shaun, do yourself a favor

36:11.961 --> 36:15.798
and be there for as many moments
as you can.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.138
[rain falling]

36:31.105 --> 36:32.607
[Dr. Park] Taking the scenic route?

36:33.399 --> 36:36.194
Car needs brakes
and Uber's taking forever.

36:38.112 --> 36:39.322
Chess guy's super cool.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.201
He's gonna teach me
Petrov's Defense while he heals.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.374
I didn't mean to take things
so far in front of Andrews.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.460
I guess I had a tiny overreaction.

36:53.961 --> 36:57.590
It's okay for us to be nice
to each other… Sometimes.

37:00.801 --> 37:01.802
Headed home?

37:03.721 --> 37:06.224
I wouldn't mind some company,
if you're up for it.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.352
See?

37:09.435 --> 37:10.519
Nice is good.

37:13.648 --> 37:14.857
Sometimes.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.651
I'll see you at your place.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.621
[monitor beeping]

37:34.752 --> 37:35.836
Where's Leo?

37:37.546 --> 37:38.756
I don't know.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.760
I asked him if this could be enough.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.096
If I could be…

37:47.473 --> 37:48.891
He loves me.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.810
I knew that.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.729
But not enough.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.402
I suppose I knew that too.

37:59.485 --> 38:00.695
[sniffles]

38:01.904 --> 38:06.325
As long as he was here,
I would never make room for anyone else.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.912
So I asked him to go.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.548
I'm sorry.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.466
It's okay.

38:23.509 --> 38:25.553
I'm sure there are a ton of great guys

38:25.636 --> 38:27.179
who'd want to be with a one-legged,

38:27.263 --> 38:29.682
unemployed former dancer
with chronic nosebleeds.

38:29.765 --> 38:30.975
[both chuckle]

38:31.976 --> 38:32.977
[sniffles]

39:01.881 --> 39:04.091
I've been mad at you for so long.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.094
I…

39:08.220 --> 39:10.848
That I couldn't feel any other emotion.

39:10.931 --> 39:12.141
Just anger.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.518
Angry at you.

39:15.811 --> 39:18.356
Angry at myself for secretly wishing

39:18.439 --> 39:21.067
you would turn up
on my doorstep my entire life.

39:22.651 --> 39:24.487
[sighs] I thought I'd outgrown it.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.579
But when you went into surgery today…

39:36.874 --> 39:38.417
I didn't feel anger.

39:38.501 --> 39:39.585
I felt…

39:42.254 --> 39:43.464
Fear.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.433
[grunts softly]

40:09.824 --> 40:11.242
[speaks hoarsely, indistinctly]

40:11.325 --> 40:12.535
Get some rest.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.417
When you feel better, you…

40:21.252 --> 40:22.670
You can take me for rocky road.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.550
That is still my favorite. [laughs]

40:44.358 --> 40:45.985
I love you.

41:10.426 --> 41:11.427
Are you ready?

41:11.969 --> 41:12.970
Mm-hmm.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.641
You came.

41:18.934 --> 41:19.935
Hello.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.521
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.106
I'm the dad.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.485
Nice to meet you, Dad.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.236
We just got started.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.490
-Where did you go to medical school?
-Shaun.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.991
Her diploma is not on the wall.

41:34.074 --> 41:35.451
I would like to know.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.744
Just be the dad.

41:37.536 --> 41:39.371
Sit there, be quiet, do nothing.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.001
[heartbeat]

41:47.546 --> 41:49.548
Is that the…

41:49.632 --> 41:51.342
[ob-gyn] That's the heartbeat.

41:51.675 --> 41:52.885
Right there.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.307
We're having a baby.

42:06.732 --> 42:08.567
We're having a baby.

42:16.450 --> 42:18.285
[laughs]

42:32.383 --> 42:34.385
[closing theme music playing]
