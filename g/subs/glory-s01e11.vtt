WEBVTT

01:02.020 --> 01:06.024
THE GLORY

02:04.874 --> 02:05.875
Hey.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.505
Shit. Fuck.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.855
One, two, three.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.232
<i>She'll take care of the cameras,</i>

03:11.232 --> 03:14.652
<i>so just make sure
nothing's left at the scene.</i>

03:22.160 --> 03:23.369
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

03:30.293 --> 03:34.005
OUT OF BUSINESS
DO NOT ENTER

03:34.005 --> 03:38.218
YEONGSAN FUNERAL HOME

04:11.000 --> 04:12.001
It's me.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.337
He scratched me on the foot.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.715
Okay, don't worry. I've got this covered.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.052
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

04:21.052 --> 04:24.681
I'll bury him.
That's the best way to take care of it.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.932
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

04:31.271 --> 04:34.023
You want to bury him now?
Sun's up soon.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.441
No, we can't do it today.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.320
We'll wait until it rains,
so everything's contaminated.

04:43.783 --> 04:44.784
Hey.

04:47.745 --> 04:48.913
Stop for a second.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.305
MORTUARY

05:13.688 --> 05:15.815
How did you sleep, Ms. Park?

05:27.577 --> 05:31.080
Looks like you were having a nightmare.
You can lie down before you go.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.208
Who are you?
What the hell did you just do?

05:34.792 --> 05:36.377
Where's the security camera?

05:37.503 --> 05:39.047
- Oh, are you all right?
- Let go of me!

05:39.047 --> 05:42.467
Show me now!
What did you do to me while I was asleep?

05:42.467 --> 05:43.468
What did you do?!

05:44.927 --> 05:47.972
Ma'am, there are no security cameras
in the operating room.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.807
I think you're feeling confused

05:49.807 --> 05:51.642
because the anesthesia
hasn't worn off yet.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.603
Could you explain
how you're feeling right now?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.357
Her blood pressure
and pulse were both normal.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.400
Ms. Park! You shouldn't be driving yet!

06:35.520 --> 06:40.525
THE GLORY

06:42.860 --> 06:44.529
I had so many questions.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.533
They're pointless now.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.869
Do those still cause you pain?

06:53.454 --> 06:54.372
Don't ask me that.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.459
I don't want to hear lame questions.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.629
Even if this is all pointless,

07:01.629 --> 07:03.756
there's something more important
for you to ask now.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.801
"Did Yeon-jin really do it?"

07:13.891 --> 07:17.103
So, did you look for Myeong-o?
I even sent you a picture.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.568
Anything else I need to know?

07:24.152 --> 07:27.447
You know enough to leave Yeon-jin.
What else could you need to hear?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.366
Listen.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.868
To be transparent,

07:32.660 --> 07:34.912
I want everyone in her life to leave her.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.080
Including you.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.416
Why?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.836
Because you're Yeon-jin's glory.
Don't you agree?

07:43.504 --> 07:44.922
But after all of this,

07:45.673 --> 07:48.176
I want you to become
another reminder of Yeon-jin's ruin.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.182
With a plan like this,

07:55.266 --> 07:57.351
I'm surprised you weren't more proactive.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.521
You aren't that aggressive.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.572
I'm not going to leave her.

08:13.034 --> 08:13.868
Why not?

08:15.119 --> 08:16.120
I don't know.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.457
I don't like admitting it either,

08:20.541 --> 08:21.709
but I really don't.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.257
I only realized
I'm not going to leave Yeon-jin right now.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.095
So, maybe...

08:36.933 --> 08:38.059
we should meet again.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.167
Go sleep. It'll be 20 minutes.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.717
I haven't eaten either.
I'll wake you up for it.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.763
I'm awake.
What you're cooking smells so good.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.058
Is there some for me?

09:19.559 --> 09:20.726
It's amazing, right?

09:20.726 --> 09:23.312
Oh! Park Yeon-jin came
and got the procedure.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.356
And I just met with Ha Do-yeong.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.151
I'm a terrible cook,
but at least let me help.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.945
I can still follow directions.

09:38.869 --> 09:39.870
Ah!

09:41.289 --> 09:42.164
It's hot.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.624
You'll get hurt.

09:46.335 --> 09:50.089
I'm so used to them, but I guess my scars
can be hard for people to look at.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.717
It's not that at all.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.928
Why did you dress up so nicely
to go to see Ha Do-yeong?

09:55.928 --> 09:58.139
You could have just gone in your sweats.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.849
Your face says that.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.144
It was just cold today.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.939
Call me over when you're done.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.150
I didn't even get a chance
to wash my face.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.778
Let me heal you.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.203
Starting with the wounds
closest to your wrists,

10:21.912 --> 10:24.498
and then working on the ones
closest to your ankles.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.126
It'd be pointless.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.628
It wouldn't be that.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.591
An old wound can only heal and recover
by making a new, deeper cut.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.510
The fresh cut will repair the tissue.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.596
I'll make the cuts for you.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.975
You might not go back
to what you were before,

10:42.975 --> 10:44.310
but you can get close.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.609
It's pointless,
because I'm not in pain now.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.793
<i>Sun-a did an excellent job
with the interview at the embassy.</i>

11:08.793 --> 11:10.544
<i>You can send the agency fee</i>

11:10.544 --> 11:13.422
<i>and buy her plane ticket
for the date she's to leave.</i>

11:15.216 --> 11:18.219
Thank you so much.
Please text me the account number.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.904
Who's got the prettiest "V"?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.198
Oh, you're all so pretty.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.701
All right, let's go to the jungle gym.
Come on.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.830
Okay, be careful.
Careful, careful.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.207
Careful. Okay.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.740
<i>I have a package for you.</i>

12:21.866 --> 12:23.534
- A package?
- Yeah.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.497
I'm not waiting for any packages.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.835
It's for you to feel better.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.629
Dong-eun sent this to you.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.694
<i>They picked
a home-stay family for Sun-a.</i>

12:58.694 --> 13:01.322
<i>If you want to say anything to them,
write it down.</i>

13:01.322 --> 13:04.074
<i>Write it in Korean.
I'll translate it for you.</i>

13:04.074 --> 13:06.160
"Laura Willson."

13:08.454 --> 13:09.413
<i>I sent the lipstick</i>

13:09.997 --> 13:12.124
<i>because I think it will look good on you.</i>

13:20.424 --> 13:23.093
<i>From now on,
I'll contact you through Sun-a's phone.</i>

13:30.100 --> 13:34.271
Our mother came back from praying
at Gyeryongsan. She prayed over this food.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.608
Oh, wow! Thank you so much for this gift.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.777
I'll be sure to savor every bite.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.447
JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE

13:44.031 --> 13:45.032
Excuse me.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.453
Yes, hello?

13:49.453 --> 13:50.538
SEOUL JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL

13:50.538 --> 13:52.414
What are you talking about?

13:52.414 --> 13:55.417
Why is the director's son
looking for Yoon So-hee's body?

13:55.918 --> 13:58.587
I have no idea why.
Trying to inherit the hospital?

14:01.215 --> 14:03.133
But you know what's even weirder?

14:03.133 --> 14:06.303
The body is in the freezer
instead of the morgue.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.848
The freezer? Why would it be in there?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.766
I don't know any of the details.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.937
I think I'm too scared to do this anymore,
between you and that visitor...

14:14.937 --> 14:16.939
Visitor? Someone from her family?

14:16.939 --> 14:19.900
No. Son Myeong-o.
He said he was her friend.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.110
- Myeong-o?
- Uh-huh.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.321
Why would he do that?

14:27.324 --> 14:30.494
What's happening?
What the hell is going on here?

14:37.001 --> 14:39.837
<i>Son Myeong-o.
What did you do to him?</i>

14:41.839 --> 14:43.507
Did he actually ask that?

14:45.092 --> 14:46.427
Maybe not. Shit.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.570
Oh, it is you. Hello there.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.574
Are you here for your retouching?
It's not today.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.701
Uh, no, I was going there.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.911
Ah.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.706
I'm so sorry, Doctor.
I guess I was out of it.

15:17.458 --> 15:21.754
Did I, uh, say weird things
to you that day?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.173
Oh.

15:27.635 --> 15:28.552
Son Myeong-o?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.223
You said that name several times that day.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.938
But that's normal
when the anesthesia hasn't worn off.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.941
They usually come from somewhere
between dream and fantasy.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.651
Oh, right.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.445
I actually had a really bad dream.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.572
That can happen when you're tired.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.241
Take your vitamins, okay?
I'll see you soon.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.473
<i>You should eat at home tonight.
I'm going to make crab stew.</i>

16:15.099 --> 16:17.017
<i>I won't be there, so it's safe, okay?</i>

16:30.990 --> 16:32.241
Why are you eating now?

16:33.075 --> 16:34.284
Didn't you see my text?

16:35.077 --> 16:35.911
I saw it.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.330
Why didn't you say anything?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.541
That is my response.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.219
Do you play Go with Moon Dong-eun? Do you?

16:52.886 --> 16:54.638
What the hell are you doing?!

16:55.264 --> 16:57.016
I just don't understand.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.477
How could somebody like Dong-eun
even manage to catch your attention?

17:02.062 --> 17:03.897
She made me curious when we met.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.900
I found myself always waiting for her.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.863
And when I met her again,
I wanted to beat her.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.908
But I lost the upper hand and floundered,

17:15.576 --> 17:16.910
because I was cornered.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.330
But part of me even wanted that, too.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.293
I liked it when she cornered me
in a Go match.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.507
You cheated on me.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.804
No matter how you phrase it,
that's cheating.

17:41.518 --> 17:44.813
Seems unfair coming from you,
but all right, then.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.609
I'm not asking about
you and Jae-jun, am I?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.618
You're not coming to the airport, are you?

17:59.286 --> 18:00.329
Neither is Mom?

18:05.459 --> 18:06.627
It's all right.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.254
I'll be okay on my own.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.049
Okay.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.803
Thank you for helping me run away.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.555
And thanks for giving me
a new life, Ms. Moon.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.642
It's not running away. There's hope now.

18:22.726 --> 18:23.644
Have fun too.

18:26.355 --> 18:30.359
I'll go to all the museums.
I swear I'll be a good person.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
I'm gonna become someone

18:34.196 --> 18:37.533
who has the ability to change
people's lives, just like you do.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.911
That's a good dream.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.457
But you don't want to be like me.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.418
I'm not a good person.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.222
MYEONG-O

19:00.222 --> 19:03.058
OCTOBER 14
HEY, TAE-UK'S EX-WIFE!

19:03.058 --> 19:04.476
HOW MUCH LONGER?

19:08.522 --> 19:09.690
<i>Are you in Russia?</i>

19:09.690 --> 19:13.360
<i>Hey, just tell me, did Dong-eun
do something to fuck with you, too?</i>

19:15.070 --> 19:16.530
This is going nowhere.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.949
I need a hint or something.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.913
Oh, the tablet.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.295
Excuse me.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.424
There should be a tablet
right behind the passenger seat.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.592
Could you get that for me?

19:37.634 --> 19:38.552
And who are you?

19:38.552 --> 19:39.970
I'm Jae-jun's girlfriend.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.221
Oh, you're his...

19:42.890 --> 19:45.225
I know Mr. Jeon's girlfriends
because I've driven them,

19:45.809 --> 19:47.019
but I've never seen you.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.189
Jae-jun is dating a redhead now, right?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.106
JAE-JUN

19:52.816 --> 19:55.652
It's me, hey. You're on speaker right now.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.071
I left my tablet in your car,
and I really need it.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.199
- But your driver is so...
-<i>Give it to her.</i>

20:00.699 --> 20:02.951
You said it's behind the passenger seat?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.002
NEW RECORDING 1
FILE SAVED

20:12.002 --> 20:13.212
Oh?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.047
Ugh, what a fucking idiot.

20:16.715 --> 20:17.925
NEW RECORDING 1

20:17.925 --> 20:19.885
October 19th?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.304
What the hell did he do now?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.142
<i>"Pommar-dee"?</i>

20:28.435 --> 20:29.436
<i>Oh shit.</i>

20:32.439 --> 20:33.523
<i>Hey there.</i>

20:35.275 --> 20:38.153
<i>- What's up?</i>
-<i>One minute. Then I'm gone.</i>

20:38.946 --> 20:41.406
<i>- You said you wanted to talk. Talk.</i>
- What is this?

20:48.330 --> 20:51.208
OCT 20 - DID YOU SELL MY CLOTHES?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE?

20:51.208 --> 20:53.252
OCT 21 - I'LL GIVE YOU COINS
COME AND GET IT

20:53.252 --> 20:54.753
OCT 23 - HEY
OCT 27 - HEY

20:54.753 --> 20:56.255
OCT 28 - FUCK, HEY

20:59.508 --> 21:01.093
<i>We keep them for 30 days.</i>

21:01.093 --> 21:04.304
But anything from before October 19th
has been reformatted.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.515
<i>You reformatted it?</i>

21:16.233 --> 21:18.610
I want to restore
some security cam footage.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.487
How long would that take?

21:21.071 --> 21:22.072
Seven to 10 days.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.741
As you can see,
I've got a lot to do right now.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.743
Even that would be quick.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.454
Any way you could do it faster?

21:29.454 --> 21:32.207
I'm really curious about something.

21:32.958 --> 21:33.959
I'm in a hurry.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.836
You still need to wait in line.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.132
Maybe let's just say you finished these.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.677
That's enough, right?

21:47.014 --> 21:49.516
Why don't we say
that I just finished these, too?

21:49.516 --> 21:50.475
Five days.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.102
Oh, you can do better.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.148
Three days.

22:02.612 --> 22:03.613
Three days?

22:17.878 --> 22:19.755
I just gave the money to Seok-jae.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.841
And I recruited a few sharks too,
so that should help.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.760
Here, take 20 first.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.137
By the way,
are you sure he has a daughter?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.056
She's not at school.
I haven't seen the kid.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.768
Just keep watching him.
I'll call you again.

22:40.108 --> 22:44.196
SEMYEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

22:49.117 --> 22:51.119
Hi, is this Semyeong Middle School?

22:52.871 --> 22:55.540
I delivered the package you wanted me to.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.626
How was she doing?

22:59.378 --> 23:00.921
She looked pretty bad.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.800
But when I mentioned you,
she seemed happy.

23:18.355 --> 23:22.192
So, her daughter is leaving tomorrow,
isn't she?

23:28.990 --> 23:30.409
Speaking of that, Seong-hee,

23:31.243 --> 23:33.036
do you still talk to, uh,

23:33.036 --> 23:35.580
those guys with all the tattoos
who you knew from before?

23:36.373 --> 23:38.166
I need their help with something.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.584
Is it possible?

24:11.825 --> 24:12.993
Whatcha looking at?

24:14.202 --> 24:15.120
Just keep walking.

24:17.873 --> 24:22.043
See that, Jjong? Look at these guys
trying to mess with you in broad daylight.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.606
MS. MOON

24:43.106 --> 24:44.983
<i>Head to the airport right now.</i>

24:44.983 --> 24:46.776
<i>Sun-a's flight leaves at 3:00.</i>

24:47.527 --> 24:49.529
<i>Don't worry about being followed.</i>

25:06.963 --> 25:08.465
You haven't learned your lesson yet?

25:13.261 --> 25:14.471
Where are you going now?

25:15.972 --> 25:18.350
I'm going to get groceries.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.435
But I can go later.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.688
Please come in.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.403
Are you going to turn your phone off
and hide again?

25:31.571 --> 25:34.491
I was just gonna go shopping. I told you.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.118
You've got guts. That's good.

25:37.786 --> 25:41.206
Why are you checking the clock?
That's rude. I just got here.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.625
What, do you need to go somewhere?

25:45.377 --> 25:47.212
Please tell me
what you're here for, ma'am.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.257
What can I do? What do you need?

25:50.257 --> 25:51.466
No bags here.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.263
Ah, if you're not leaving,

25:56.263 --> 25:58.848
then that must be your daughter, right?

25:59.766 --> 26:01.768
You made her drop out of school, I heard.

26:02.602 --> 26:05.647
Oh, not that.
She's not going anywhere. Can't afford it.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.483
Just tell me
what you're here for please, ma'am.

26:08.483 --> 26:11.778
Where is your daughter?
Answer me, right now.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.867
Is she leaving today? Like right now?

26:17.867 --> 26:20.662
Oh, she's not!
No, she's not, ma'am. I swear.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.956
It is today.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.041
God, you weren't bluffing.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.920
So I guess you really aren't scared of me.

26:29.796 --> 26:33.383
Were you leaving to see your daughter?
Carrying that fake bag?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.219
You're not going anywhere today.

26:36.803 --> 26:39.014
Shouldn't you know
that Hye-jeong is a flight attendant?

26:40.015 --> 26:41.558
Want me to find your daughter right now?

26:42.517 --> 26:44.644
I won't go, ma'am. I won't go!

26:44.644 --> 26:47.606
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.
I swear I will.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.357
Just give me the word and I will.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.740
So listen now. Do as I say.

26:57.782 --> 27:01.119
Does Dong-eun have another little helper?
Who would that be?

27:07.917 --> 27:10.962
There's also a man, I heard.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.673
There's a man?

27:14.424 --> 27:16.092
Dong-eun has some guy?

27:16.718 --> 27:17.886
What does he do?

27:18.470 --> 27:21.806
I'm not too sure what he does,
but I'll find out, though.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.434
I'll find out about him
and I'll call you, ma'am!

27:24.434 --> 27:27.228
If you try anything,
I'll drag your daughter here.

27:27.228 --> 27:29.606
I won't! I swear I won't, ma'am.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.526
I'll just have to trust you, then.

27:34.944 --> 27:35.945
Oh, and also,

27:37.030 --> 27:39.449
what you were doing, keep doing it.

27:40.533 --> 27:44.621
So Jae-jun and Sa-ra and Hye-jeong,
keep following them.

27:45.330 --> 27:48.208
I want you to find out
who's meeting who, when, and where.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.085
Got it?

27:52.545 --> 27:53.797
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.716
See you around.

28:02.055 --> 28:05.266
Oh, your husband hasn't been
coming home recently, right?

28:07.310 --> 28:09.479
I've been giving him some money to gamble.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.399
But not today.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.235
So, he'll be home early.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.990
You deserve to be punished. See you soon.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.174
- The son of the hospital's director?
- Yeah.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.719
He's been sniffing around about So-hee.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.761
What do we do?

28:42.345 --> 28:43.847
You said not to worry.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.599
You told me she would
rot into a pile of muck

28:46.599 --> 28:49.310
in that mortuary after 18 years.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.020
She didn't. They froze her.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.857
What if they perform an autopsy?

28:54.441 --> 28:56.317
Froze her? Why would they do that?

28:56.317 --> 28:58.403
How would I know? Why are you asking me?

28:59.279 --> 29:01.239
Shouldn't you know the answer to that?!

29:01.781 --> 29:03.575
What? We're in this whole mess

29:03.575 --> 29:06.202
because you couldn't take care of
a fucking corpse, okay?

29:07.328 --> 29:08.663
Are you sure it's frozen?

29:09.164 --> 29:12.083
Isn't that illegal?
What are they playing at?

29:20.717 --> 29:21.801
Hello there, sir.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.553
- Hey, I need a word.
- Yes, sir?

29:23.553 --> 29:27.307
Which department oversees how a hospital
handles its storage of bodies?

29:27.807 --> 29:29.476
Which department oversees bodies?

29:29.476 --> 29:32.187
There's a body family members
kept for over a decade.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.938
But the hospital chose to freeze it.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.357
I want to know
what the law says about that.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.818
Isn't doing that illegal?

29:38.818 --> 29:39.986
More than a decade?

29:41.362 --> 29:45.450
The district office or maybe the Ministry
of Health and Welfare would handle that.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.659
But I can do some research.

29:46.659 --> 29:49.704
I'm planning to find some fault with it.
Can you help me?

29:51.581 --> 29:52.957
Yes. I'll look into it.

29:59.422 --> 30:02.091
Sun-a, come on.
It's time to go in.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.093
Can we wait just five more minutes?

30:08.014 --> 30:09.516
<i>"To Mrs. Laura."</i>

30:10.683 --> 30:12.477
<i>"Hello, there."</i>

30:12.477 --> 30:14.437
<i>"I'm the mother of Lee Sun-a,</i>

30:14.437 --> 30:17.899
<i>who should have arrived along with
this letter I'm sending you now."</i>

30:20.276 --> 30:21.528
Fucking bitch!

30:23.822 --> 30:25.573
Stupid fucking bitch.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.287
Look at all this money!

30:33.164 --> 30:35.917
Shit, why did you quit
your fucking job, you bitch?

30:35.917 --> 30:37.627
Come on.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.797
Hey. You're up to something,
aren't you? Huh?

30:41.714 --> 30:44.217
Where the hell did you send Sun-a,
you bitch? Huh?

30:44.217 --> 30:47.762
Where did you send her?
Tell me right now! Where? Huh?

30:49.264 --> 30:50.139
Where?

30:50.139 --> 30:54.227
<i>"Sun-a was
the only ray of sunshine</i>

30:54.727 --> 30:56.938
<i>in my entire unfortunate life."</i>

31:01.568 --> 31:04.153
<i>"I promise that I won't ask you for much.</i>"

31:05.905 --> 31:08.741
<i>"Sun-a doesn't have any allergies,
and she's healthy."</i>

31:09.701 --> 31:12.328
<i>"So please let her try
a lot of different foods."</i>

31:15.790 --> 31:19.460
<i>"I'm sending my joy to you."</i>

31:20.295 --> 31:21.546
Hey, Mom, look!

31:21.546 --> 31:23.089
<i>"And please,</i>

31:24.132 --> 31:25.466
<i>give her so much love.</i>"

31:27.260 --> 31:30.305
<i>"Please love her."</i>

31:32.765 --> 31:34.100
I know what you did.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.936
You're seeing someone else
and she's at his place.

31:36.936 --> 31:40.356
Who is this guy?
Who the hell is he, you fucking whore?

31:40.356 --> 31:42.442
Answer me. Answer me, you whore!

31:42.442 --> 31:43.902
Fucking answer me, bitch!

31:45.069 --> 31:46.070
Answer me!

31:46.571 --> 31:47.572
Answer!

31:49.449 --> 31:50.450
Even if

31:52.410 --> 31:54.203
you try to break me,

31:55.997 --> 31:59.000
I am not scared of you anymore.

32:01.127 --> 32:04.964
And I will wear red lipstick.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.343
And I'll wear a leather jacket.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.721
Since you're still giving me
this bullshit,

32:11.721 --> 32:13.431
I'll beat your ass again!

32:13.932 --> 32:16.684
You bitch! God damn it!

32:18.227 --> 32:19.604
And I will...

32:22.315 --> 32:26.152
go to a new country, far away from here,

32:26.903 --> 32:28.738
and drive on and on.

32:31.407 --> 32:34.118
Shit. Do whatever you fucking want.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.039
You're dead, okay? Dead!

32:38.039 --> 32:41.292
You're fucking dead!

32:58.935 --> 32:59.936
Let's go.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.129
MOM

33:31.884 --> 33:33.678
MOM - I'M OUT OF RICE
BRING ME MONEY

33:41.644 --> 33:43.730
Close your eyes and sit right there.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.066
This sound always helped me calm down.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.069
It can help you relax a little bit.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.413
So, that's what those were for.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.666
They help to calm your mind.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.190
Come on. Close your eyes now.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.231
One, two, three, four...

35:08.231 --> 35:09.774
PARENT EMERGENCY CONTACT

35:09.774 --> 35:11.275
...five.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.694
What if she actually answers?

35:14.195 --> 35:16.364
Don't worry about it. She won't pick up.

35:16.364 --> 35:20.201
Anyway, whatever. She'll never come here
if you keep calling her like this.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.870
Then I'll press
the numbers even faster.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.540
Oh. Someone's calling you.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.502
Fuck, I guess she's finally calling.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.295
She's the first one I texted.

35:35.174 --> 35:37.510
Is this Seung-a's mom?

35:38.845 --> 35:41.389
Can we go talk at the...

35:41.389 --> 35:42.807
Aw!

35:43.391 --> 35:45.601
Looks like Seung-a got her looks from you.

35:46.435 --> 35:49.188
She's the class president, right?

35:49.188 --> 35:53.651
So, I guess you're
super proud of her, aren't you?

35:55.528 --> 35:56.612
Yes.

35:56.612 --> 35:59.866
Why did you want to see me?
You said you needed to talk.

36:00.449 --> 36:04.579
Well, Moon Dong-eun is my daughter.

36:05.413 --> 36:06.581
And so?

36:07.623 --> 36:09.834
I'm the mother of Seung-a's teacher.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.171
Didn't the other moms tell you
about what's been going on?

36:15.548 --> 36:16.382
You're crazy.

36:17.133 --> 36:17.967
What?

36:19.051 --> 36:23.097
I checked your paperwork,
and in about... Oh, I had it. Here it is...

36:23.097 --> 36:24.015
A week or so,

36:24.015 --> 36:26.726
the real estate registration
will be available.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.643
All right.

36:29.437 --> 36:33.274
I don't mean to pry, but why would you
want to buy an abandoned funeral home?

36:33.274 --> 36:35.067
Are you trying to renovate, or...

36:36.068 --> 36:37.778
If you really want chocolate, sir,

36:37.778 --> 36:40.531
then you need to buy the box
the chocolate comes in.

36:41.032 --> 36:41.949
It's kind of like that.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.577
Ah, I see.

36:46.162 --> 36:48.331
It's been on the market for quite a while.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.250
- You bought it for a very good price.
- Thank you so much.

37:13.481 --> 37:16.108
<i>Hi, Mom. I got here safely.</i>

37:17.860 --> 37:21.155
<i>I thought you might have my phone
and be able to read this.</i>

37:21.155 --> 37:23.950
<i>I waited for you at the airport
for a really long time.</i>

37:24.450 --> 37:26.744
<i>I'm sad I didn't see you before I left,</i>

37:26.744 --> 37:28.287
<i>but I'll be waiting for you,</i>

37:28.788 --> 37:30.623
<i>because I know you'll join me soon.</i>

37:31.374 --> 37:32.208
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

37:34.043 --> 37:36.087
<i>I love you so much.</i>

Ah, shit.

39:25.237 --> 39:26.155
The fuck?

39:30.868 --> 39:31.869
Get over there.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.122
What the fuck is this?

39:37.625 --> 39:39.668
Oh, you fucking bitch. Come here!

39:40.378 --> 39:42.838
Come here. Come on. God fucking damn it.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.591
You bitch. You little...

39:46.675 --> 39:48.427
What is this? Where'd you get this?

39:49.095 --> 39:50.429
You said you don't have any money!

39:51.347 --> 39:53.474
It's not my money. I have to give it back.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.018
Don't give me
that fucking bullshit, bitch!

39:57.353 --> 39:59.772
Is Sun-a working somewhere?
Which bar is it?

40:01.065 --> 40:04.026
Damn it, this is all you got
for her so far? You're such an idiot!

40:04.026 --> 40:06.070
Sun-a's a child, she's only 14!

40:07.071 --> 40:08.656
- How could you even think that?
- Bullshit!

40:09.824 --> 40:11.742
If she isn't, where is she, then?

40:13.536 --> 40:15.037
Some woman.

40:16.038 --> 40:19.792
She asked me
to send somebody a text with my phone.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.503
She said they knew her number already.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.589
And that she wanted to scare them.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.844
But then I read the text
and it just seemed so weird to me.

40:30.636 --> 40:31.637
I swear.

40:32.304 --> 40:33.472
- What did the text say?
- I...

40:34.056 --> 40:36.892
I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna give it all back.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.394
Please, let me give it back!

40:38.394 --> 40:40.396
God damn it, just answer my question!

40:41.480 --> 40:42.481
Show me the text.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.359
Where's your phone?

40:48.446 --> 40:50.030
SEVEN MISSED CALLS
MA'AM

40:52.867 --> 40:54.243
I JUST NEED YOU TO SEND A TEXT

40:54.243 --> 40:55.161
I WON'T DO IT

40:55.161 --> 40:56.662
THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S GOOD MONEY

41:09.133 --> 41:11.093
So this is what you've been up to, huh?

41:26.192 --> 41:27.026
Kim.

41:28.277 --> 41:31.030
Gyeong-ran.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.240
Huh?

41:36.076 --> 41:37.536
You have an "o" in your name.

41:38.787 --> 41:39.622
An "o"?

41:40.789 --> 41:42.208
<i>Did you forget?</i>

41:42.708 --> 41:44.084
<i>The shaman said you'd get bad luck...</i>

41:44.084 --> 41:45.461
MOON DONG-EUN

41:45.461 --> 41:47.004
<i>from people with O's in their name.</i>

41:47.922 --> 41:48.923
<i>Son Myeong-o.</i>

41:51.467 --> 41:53.052
Ms. Park, we're ready for you.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.136
Okay.

41:55.846 --> 41:57.223
That's a nice pattern, right?

41:57.223 --> 41:58.974
- I really like this.
- It's so well made.

41:58.974 --> 42:00.059
Look, this one here.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.852
Amazing.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.189
Oh!

42:05.773 --> 42:06.982
Oh my gosh.

42:07.483 --> 42:10.402
My God!
Wow! Look at this one.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.530
I KNOW THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
KILLED SOMEBODY

42:19.620 --> 42:22.373
I KNOW THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
KILLED SOMEBODY

42:23.332 --> 42:24.458
What's wrong?

42:25.459 --> 42:27.628
Yeong-ae! Hey, Yeong-ae!

42:27.628 --> 42:29.380
Yeong-ae, what's wrong? Yeong-ae?

42:30.297 --> 42:31.298
Yeong-ae!

42:32.675 --> 42:34.051
Hey, Yeong-ae!

42:35.177 --> 42:36.262
Yeong-ae!

42:37.930 --> 42:39.390
Stop! What's wrong?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.352
Yeong-ae, stop!

42:55.906 --> 42:58.033
<i>Do you remember, Yeon-jin?</i>

42:58.993 --> 43:03.539
<i>Some time ago, you told your audience
to watch out for swells.</i>

43:03.539 --> 43:06.375
Swells will be flowing
into the East Sea for some time,

43:06.375 --> 43:10.004
and in some places, high waves
will be going over the seashore rocks.

43:10.004 --> 43:11.839
A swell is mostly a receding wave,

43:11.839 --> 43:15.634
but can also be the most ferocious wave
seen in the entire ocean.

43:16.510 --> 43:19.221
<i>A swell can be
especially scary,</i>

43:19.221 --> 43:22.641
<i>because an accurate
forecasting method hasn't been developed,</i>

43:23.601 --> 43:25.644
<i>so it's incredibly hard to predict.</i>

43:26.645 --> 43:29.231
<i>And it can consume
everything in an instant,</i>

43:29.982 --> 43:31.775
<i>even if the water was calm,</i>

43:32.276 --> 43:33.277
<i>without ripples.</i>

43:53.631 --> 43:56.300
<i>That day was
the first time Ms. Kang saw</i>

43:56.300 --> 43:59.345
<i>her face as she had never seen it before.</i>

44:00.095 --> 44:03.932
<i>For the first time,
she could see hope on her own face.</i>

44:05.559 --> 44:08.771
<i>But I don't think
that she was the only one</i>

44:09.563 --> 44:11.065
<i>who found hope that day.</i>

44:14.860 --> 44:17.029
FORENSIC DATA RECOVERY

44:35.964 --> 44:36.965
How do I look?

44:37.883 --> 44:40.260
Hey, this is green, right?

44:41.887 --> 44:43.555
There's a little red on them too.

44:44.264 --> 44:45.265
Where?

45:07.830 --> 45:08.831
Here.

45:13.836 --> 45:16.130
Aren't you supposed to be a cop?

45:17.297 --> 45:18.549
I am, yeah.

45:20.050 --> 45:22.553
But if all police officers
were just and had a sense of duty,

45:22.553 --> 45:24.054
then why would we need the law?

45:24.680 --> 45:27.850
My standards are rising now,
but I think I'm also out of luck.

45:30.018 --> 45:31.186
So keep an eye on it.

45:32.271 --> 45:33.939
That guy's my pension, all right?

45:36.358 --> 45:38.110
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.331
Do you still feel sick?

45:54.209 --> 45:55.961
Maybe I drove too recklessly.

46:00.215 --> 46:01.633
I have a question.

46:04.386 --> 46:09.558
Before you even saw
the pictures up on my walls of them,

46:10.768 --> 46:12.394
you already knew about Myeong-o.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.439
Why didn't you tell me?

46:16.106 --> 46:17.858
Why didn't you ask me anything?

46:18.484 --> 46:19.943
Did you think I killed him?

46:25.324 --> 46:29.077
Executioners don't question those above.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.039
It all comes to the same conclusion.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.627
I don't care if you killed him,
and I don't care if you didn't kill him.

46:37.836 --> 46:40.672
Whether you want a corpse
or the evidence destroyed,

46:41.507 --> 46:43.675
I'm here to do whatever you want.

46:47.054 --> 46:48.722
Who am I to you?

46:48.722 --> 46:51.475
Why do you want to do this for me?
What makes you so sure?

46:51.475 --> 46:53.936
This is so much deeper than "sure."

46:55.854 --> 46:57.689
I've already told you before.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.818
I had a very rough period of my life.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.613
And I realized when I tutored you...

47:05.280 --> 47:07.699
"Oh, this woman..."

47:08.534 --> 47:09.701
"She can save me."

47:15.707 --> 47:19.795
Well, at some point, we all get to choose
what kind of person we'll become.

47:20.963 --> 47:24.550
I've chosen to become
the one who's your partner in crime.

47:25.968 --> 47:27.219
It suits me as well.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.684
Anyone ever tell you you're crazy?

47:34.268 --> 47:35.644
As crazy as you need.

47:37.396 --> 47:38.480
Will you let me?

47:44.653 --> 47:46.989
<i>I wonder
which one of us will cause</i>

47:46.989 --> 47:50.117
<i>an unpredictable swell
with our hope, Yeon-jin.</i>

48:31.742 --> 48:33.035
YEONGSAN FUNERAL HOME

48:33.035 --> 48:34.786
Hello! Welcome.
