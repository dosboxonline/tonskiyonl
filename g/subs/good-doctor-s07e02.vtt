WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:05.396
Grasp is good,

00:05.396 --> 00:09.879
but Steve's not gaining weight
quite as quickly as I'd like.

00:09.879 --> 00:12.534
I'm feeding him
every two to three hours
during the day,

00:12.534 --> 00:14.318
every three to four at night.

00:14.318 --> 00:17.321
And pumping in between
to increase milk production.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.236
Well, I'm going to recommend
you start supplementing
with formula.

00:19.236 --> 00:22.152
But everyone says
"breast is best"?

00:22.152 --> 00:23.719
Breast milk
is the ideal.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.851
Right now, Steve just
needs a little extra.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.766
Some samples
to get you started.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.768
This is an excellent product,

00:29.768 --> 00:31.509
and it will make it
easier for me

00:31.509 --> 00:33.076
to do more nighttime feedings.

00:33.859 --> 00:36.036
Yeah. Yeah.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.345
I thought being co-presidents

00:41.345 --> 00:43.260
meant we would
do things <i>together.</i>

00:45.306 --> 00:47.569
I was aiming for...

00:47.569 --> 00:51.399
you do some things
and I do some things.

00:51.399 --> 00:54.663
Funny how your "some things"
leads to more work for <i>me.</i>

00:54.663 --> 00:56.578
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:56.578 --> 00:59.624
The affiliation deal
with San Jose Med School?

00:59.624 --> 01:02.888
We had to cover the overages
because the nurses unionized.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.803
In exchange, we teach
a few med students.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.979
You won't be
teaching anyone.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.372
<i>I</i> will have
the useless baby docs

01:08.372 --> 01:10.200
wandering around the department

01:10.200 --> 01:12.159
- like lost children
with scalpels.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.161
We made a good deal. That's it.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.728
It's a good deal.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.050
We should go
introduce ourselves.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.574
No, they are baby ducklings,
and I will not be their mommy.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.100
Let them imprint
on Shaun and Park.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.103
Hi!

01:43.103 --> 01:44.147
Bye.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.635
Hi, I'm Dr. Park.
This is Doctor--

01:53.635 --> 01:55.115
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.421
I... I can't believe
it's really you.

01:57.421 --> 01:58.596
I'm just so excited,
I'm about to pee myself.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.598
Please do not.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.948
Of course not.
You're... You're not a shaker.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.776
There was a March 2012 abstract

02:04.776 --> 02:06.778
that demonstrated
a reluctance to shake hands

02:06.778 --> 02:08.563
could be used as a diagnostic
marker for ASD.

02:08.563 --> 02:09.868
But I love a good, firm grip.

02:09.868 --> 02:10.782
That's why they call it
a spectrum.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.175
We could shake.

02:13.611 --> 02:14.786
That's not very firm.

02:14.786 --> 02:15.918
Okay. That's better.

02:15.918 --> 02:16.962
I'm Charlotte Lukaitis.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.486
Nice to meet you, Charlotte.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.357
I go by "Charlie" for now,
"Dr. Lukaitis" soon.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.445
Only two years away
from my goal,

02:21.445 --> 02:23.055
which I've had since I was 17,

02:23.055 --> 02:24.622
ever since I saw that
viral video of you saving

02:24.622 --> 02:26.015
that boy
at the San Jose Airport

02:26.015 --> 02:27.321
using a homemade one-way valve.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.453
It was the coolest,
most heroic thing

02:29.453 --> 02:31.020
I've ever seen
from a person with ASD.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.848
It was very heroic.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.066
I picked San Jose
for medical school

02:34.066 --> 02:35.503
hoping to engineer
a run-in with you,

02:35.503 --> 02:36.982
but then your hospital
partnered with my school,

02:36.982 --> 02:38.593
and it's like what Taylor Swift
says in "Mastermind"--

02:38.593 --> 02:40.421
Charlie.

02:40.421 --> 02:43.250
Dom helps me when I,
you know, talk too much.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.034
Hi, I'm Dominick Hubank.

02:45.034 --> 02:48.124
And we're happy to have
such eager future doctors
joining the team.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.647
Future surgeon.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.083
I don't want to be a surgeon,

02:51.083 --> 02:52.172
but I'm excited
for the rotation.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.826
Okay.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.654
Charlie, you are on my team.

02:56.654 --> 02:57.612
Yes!

03:11.974 --> 03:13.584
Would you like to present?

03:13.584 --> 03:14.324
I'd love to.

03:17.066 --> 03:20.025
- Richard Shelford, 53--
- Call me Rich.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.331
Not that I'm wealthy.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.986
Right, Rich Shelford,
53 years old--

03:23.986 --> 03:25.466
Don't feel a day over 52.

03:25.466 --> 03:27.207
- That's funny.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.513
Okay. This is taking too long.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.733
Please tell us what happened.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.301
He was coughing so hard
he couldn't catch his breath,

03:34.301 --> 03:35.911
and then he fainted
and hit his head.

03:36.825 --> 03:37.565
Cough syncope.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.394
He's thinner and way more tired

03:40.394 --> 03:42.004
than the last time
he visited me.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.440
Yeah, but I'm fine.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.876
It's just a little cold.

03:44.876 --> 03:47.444
You could barely breathe, Dad.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.533
Um, chest X-ray shows
multiple lung nodules

03:49.533 --> 03:50.665
and enlarged lymph nodes

03:50.665 --> 03:52.449
in the hilar
and mediastinal areas.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.408
Get an ABG, CBC,
perform a bronchoscopy,

03:54.408 --> 03:55.974
and send biopsies to path.

03:55.974 --> 03:58.020
Can you apply a wound dressing
using the Turban Technique?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.108
I sure can.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.287
Hey, uh...

04:04.287 --> 04:06.115
how long until
we could get out of here?

04:06.115 --> 04:08.509
My daughter, she took some time
off work to show me around.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.293
She's got her own business.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.513
Works as a tech consultant
for a few companies
around the Valley.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.558
- Dad.
- Let the man brag.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.256
- It's every proud
father's right.
- Yeah.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.911
- Hold this, please.
- Oh.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.654
<i>Basic Turban Technique
for head bandaging.</i>

04:23.654 --> 04:27.354
<i>Step one, tie the ends
of two bandages together
in a knot.</i>

04:27.354 --> 04:29.312
<i>Step two,
starting from one ear...</i>

04:29.312 --> 04:31.140
The patient
was a good sport about it,

04:31.140 --> 04:32.359
but his daughter was not happy.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.709
A wound dressing
is very low stakes.

04:34.709 --> 04:37.538
Did Charlie do a bad job
following the tutorial?

04:37.538 --> 04:40.236
Uh, no. Actually, the dressing
was pretty decent.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.325
But the point is, the patient's
family were uncomfortable.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.243
I think someone should tell her

04:47.243 --> 04:48.984
no more how-to videos
in front of patients.

04:50.028 --> 04:52.292
Oh. You can if you want.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.341
We were able to repair
your skull fracture

04:58.341 --> 05:00.300
and evacuate
a large subdural hematoma.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.345
Lucky day.
Is there a Wi-Fi password?

05:02.345 --> 05:03.303
I need to get
League Pass in here.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.480
Uh, the accident report says

05:06.480 --> 05:08.612
that you stepped right
in front of an oncoming car.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.397
I just didn't see it.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.050
Big day today.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.183
I got the Clips and the points,
the money line, and the over.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.098
And it's the last leg
of a six-team parlay

05:16.098 --> 05:17.491
that I <i>need</i> to come through.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.970
That's a lot of action.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.408
Well, having some
skin in the game
makes life more fun.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.891
Hey, you're The Dominator.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.330
Uh, just "Dom" now.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.157
My football days are behind me.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.203
That pancake block you had
against Stanford?

05:34.203 --> 05:35.944
Cleared the way
for that 75-yard run?

05:35.944 --> 05:38.207
Made me 10 grand,
that one play!

05:38.207 --> 05:39.339
Why aren't you in the league?

05:39.339 --> 05:40.992
Decided I wanted to help people

05:40.992 --> 05:42.342
instead of hurt them.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.040
Okay, let's draw blood
for post-op hematocrit.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.563
Once the brain swelling
comes down, you can go.

05:49.914 --> 05:50.828
Have you done a blood draw yet?

05:52.003 --> 05:53.962
It's my first day
out of the classroom.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.006
Five bucks he gets an A.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.399
No.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.885
All right. You're going
to palpate for a vein.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.757
Oh, and remember,
when introducing the needle,

06:06.757 --> 06:10.848
always bevel up and insert
the tube into the vacutainer.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.634
And you just passed
phlebotomy 101.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.463
Oh, God.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.729
You could be up five right now.

06:23.687 --> 06:24.993
He went down.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.821
I mean, hard.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.562
Frontal and parietal lobes
look clear.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.522
I'm sorry.

06:32.522 --> 06:35.264
I did deadlifts
and squats this morning.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.700
Didn't have time
to eat breakfast.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.223
Feeling okay now?

06:38.223 --> 06:40.095
My ego took a hit,
but I'll be okay.

06:41.662 --> 06:42.793
Whoa!

06:42.793 --> 06:44.926
Is that our patient's brain?

06:44.926 --> 06:47.885
Mm. You just passed
anatomy 101.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.409
Which part's the front?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.584
Oh, spoke too soon.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.107
This is the axial plane,

06:52.107 --> 06:53.500
which means
we're looking down
from the top.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.896
These are the temporal
and occipital lobes here.
Also clear.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.245
How can you tell?

07:00.245 --> 07:01.725
We injected gadolinium,
which leaks out

07:01.725 --> 07:03.031
around the areas of injury

07:03.031 --> 07:05.207
and makes them show up
brighter on the scan.

07:05.903 --> 07:06.687
Like that?

07:09.341 --> 07:11.431
Yeah. Like that.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.695
That's a tumor,

07:14.695 --> 07:16.392
completely interwoven
with his brain stem

07:16.392 --> 07:17.611
and cranial nerves

07:17.611 --> 07:19.830
and extending
to his upper spinal cord.

07:19.830 --> 07:22.311
I guess we know
why he didn't see that car.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.491
You are descending
through the larynx

07:28.491 --> 07:31.363
to the trachea
and onto the carina.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.540
- Nicely identified.
- Thank you.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.107
Positive affirmations are
empowering for people with ASD.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.282
"My autism is awesome."

07:37.282 --> 07:39.067
Onto the bronchi
and bronchioles.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.897
I use Taylor Swift mnemonics.
Do you guys do that, too?

07:43.811 --> 07:45.029
- No.
- I do.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.292
I wonder if ours are the same.

07:47.292 --> 07:51.122
Basic airway anatomy,
L, T, C, B, B.

07:51.122 --> 07:54.430
"Lover," "Treacherous,"
"Cardigan," "Babe,"
and "Bejeweled."

07:54.430 --> 07:57.738
I used "Bad Blood" for both
bronchi and bronchioles.
Two for one.

07:57.738 --> 07:58.913
Mm.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.044
He knows one song.

08:04.875 --> 08:08.488
Look at the patches
on the bronchial mucosa.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.880
There's
a luminal narrowing

08:09.880 --> 08:11.142
from the enlarged lymph nodes.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.885
This definitely
isn't pneumonia.

08:14.885 --> 08:15.973
Cool.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.409
My first medical mystery.

08:18.236 --> 08:19.499
Can I page Dr. Murphy?

08:26.549 --> 08:27.855
Did you ever
cut quartz countertops?

08:30.031 --> 08:32.294
Yeah.

08:33.469 --> 08:36.080
I started off
in a fabrication shop.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.473
How'd you know that?

08:37.473 --> 08:39.693
Cutting quartz produces
toxic fine-dust particles

08:39.693 --> 08:41.738
that have embedded
in your airway and lungs.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.698
You have silicosis.

08:44.698 --> 08:45.916
It's like watching
a magic trick.

08:47.831 --> 08:51.269
Uh, my doc said it was
just a recurring pneumonia.

08:51.269 --> 08:54.490
Silicosis can often
be misdiagnosed
until it's too late.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.666
You will need
a bilateral lung transplant.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.149
He needs new lungs?

09:01.149 --> 09:04.152
Yes. With your declining
respiratory function

09:04.152 --> 09:05.849
and extensive damage,

09:05.849 --> 09:07.851
you should be prioritized
for transplant.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.940
But you will need
full-time home care
for the rest of your life.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.337
But I live alone
back in Florida.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.382
Dad, one step at a time.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.169
I think you should
get the surgery here,

09:21.169 --> 09:21.996
then move in with me.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.214
I can't do that.

09:23.214 --> 09:24.781
Of course you can.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.957
Your career has just taken off.
I'm not gonna burden you.

09:26.957 --> 09:30.265
It's not a burden.
You're my dad.

09:30.265 --> 09:33.050
You peeled my oranges
and coached my soccer team.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.575
Then you put me through college
and business school.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.578
Let me take care of you.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.239
Someone raised his girl right.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.070
Okay.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.682
We will call
a transplant coordinator.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.643
Where's Steve?

10:00.643 --> 10:02.166
Down the hall,
flirting with the nurses.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.255
I need you to write me
a prescription for domperidone.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.301
It increases
breast milk production.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.824
All the mom message boards
say so.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.435
It is not approved
as a lactation aid anywhere.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.655
Doctors in Canada and Mexico
are using it off-label.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.484
Does Steve not like the formula
Dr. Hyland recommended?

10:15.484 --> 10:16.920
<i>I</i> don't like it, Shaun.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.662
I feel like... I feel
like a failure as a mom.

10:19.662 --> 10:22.883
But you are not a failure.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.450
You are following
all the recommended guidelines.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.496
In fact, the only guideline
you're not following

10:27.496 --> 10:29.193
is supplementing
with formula as advised.

10:29.193 --> 10:32.283
Shaun...

10:33.807 --> 10:36.897
I've been wanting
to be a mom for so long,

10:36.897 --> 10:40.683
and part of that is my body
is supposed to give Steve

10:40.683 --> 10:42.685
everything he needs,
and mine won't.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.122
And I hate it.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.303
Come in.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.349
Good. You're both here.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.307
An invite to Baby Eden's
Sip and See.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.831
So everyone
can officially meet her

10:57.831 --> 10:58.875
in a cute dress
instead of a hospital gown.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.878
Is Dr. Glassman going?

11:01.878 --> 11:04.533
- I think so.
- Then I do not want to go.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.709
I thought you and Glassy
had worked things out.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.232
He took Steve the other night.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.451
Hmm.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.844
Who cares if he's there?

11:10.844 --> 11:12.541
As long as you
and that gorgeous baby make it.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.151
Wouldn't miss it.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.675
Isn't being a mom great?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.893
The greatest.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.592
You just said
you feel like a failure.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.682
I think that is because
of a postpartum decrease

11:22.682 --> 11:23.857
in estrogen and progesterone.

11:25.597 --> 11:26.990
Did you just call me hormonal?

11:26.990 --> 11:29.950
- No, actually reduced hormonal.
- Okay, Shaun.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.995
- Time to go.
- This is my office.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.344
Let's not have it
be your gravesite.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.136
Huh. There's gotta be
something you can do.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.965
We can't safely remove
the tumor

11:44.965 --> 11:46.836
without permanent injury
to your brain stem.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.403
If you survive
the surgery at all.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.800
I'm sorry.
I know it's a lot to take in.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.802
But there's... there's new
technology all the time.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.325
Nadal's back
with the stem cells,

11:57.325 --> 11:59.066
and Bartolo Colon--

11:59.066 --> 12:01.808
Experimental treatments
on athletes'
orthopedic injuries

12:01.808 --> 12:03.766
are completely different
than brain surgery.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.812
C-Could you remove
some of the tumor?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.771
Buy me more time?
How about chemo?

12:08.771 --> 12:11.034
This type of cancer
doesn't respond to chemo.

12:11.034 --> 12:13.384
We did read a paper in class
about a TCR approach.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.559
Could that be something?

12:14.559 --> 12:16.257
That was only done a few times,

12:16.257 --> 12:17.258
and never
with brain stem involvement.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.738
TCR.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.783
It's my new favorite letters.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.524
Whatever they stand for,
let's do that.

12:28.182 --> 12:31.576
TCR means we would
saw up through your mandible

12:31.576 --> 12:33.927
and dislocate your lower jaw.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.755
Then we cut open
from the roof of your mouth

12:35.755 --> 12:36.973
to the back of your throat.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.932
That's just
to access the tumor.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.412
That tumor is woven
into your brain stem.

12:41.412 --> 12:44.241
Removing it would very likely
leave you quadriplegic,

12:44.241 --> 12:47.201
unable to speak or move,
<i>if</i> you survive the surgery.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.595
Okay.

12:50.595 --> 12:51.683
Maybe it's not my favorite.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.469
But let's try.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.474
Sal, you should enjoy
your remaining time.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.477
Travel.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.957
Connect with family.

13:10.615 --> 13:11.834
Who am I gonna connect with?

13:15.272 --> 13:17.535
Wife kicked me out
when I gambled away

13:17.535 --> 13:19.581
the kids' college fund.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.672
None of them
have talked to me for years.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.201
I got a break coming my way.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.161
I can feel it.

13:45.563 --> 13:46.869
We've got
our annual presentation

13:46.869 --> 13:48.349
to the managed care companies.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.612
They want detailed reports
on patient outcomes

13:50.612 --> 13:51.918
for diabetes, geriatrics--

13:51.918 --> 13:53.615
That's great.
Schedule that for never.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.878
- No, I've set it
for tomorrow at 9:00.
- That's the wrong answer.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.967
Unfortunately, I have
back-to-back surgeries.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.709
Thank goodness I have a partner
to do the things I can't.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.111
Oh.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.289
You know, med students
are allowed to eat
with the residents.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.856
I find the sound
of people chewing
to be unsettling.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.300
Well, if you want some guidance

14:26.300 --> 14:28.911
and you don't mind the sound
of sipping noises,

14:28.911 --> 14:31.392
Jordan and I
can take you for coffee.

14:31.392 --> 14:37.964
<i>♪ Happy Birthday, Dear Daddy ♪</i>

14:37.964 --> 14:39.400
Ha--

14:39.400 --> 14:42.403
Uh, baby, let me call you
right back.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.016
Where did you get your bra?

14:47.016 --> 14:49.932
I've always been intrigued
by lace. Is it okay?

14:49.932 --> 14:52.587
Kind of busy right now.
Can we talk upstairs later?

14:52.587 --> 14:53.631
What are you doing?

14:53.631 --> 14:55.198
Just talking to a friend.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.939
You called him "Daddy,"
but your dad's upstairs.

14:58.462 --> 15:01.770
He's a client,
a regular.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.120
He paid me five grand
for a last-minute session.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.079
Lucky for me,
he's into exhibitionism.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.819
Five grand?
That's more than I made

15:07.819 --> 15:10.300
a whole month waitressing,
including tips.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.172
Do people tip sex workers?

15:12.172 --> 15:14.870
Charlie, this isn't
any of our business, so...

15:14.870 --> 15:16.698
Plenty of people
know what I do.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.308
Just not my actual father.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.790
Please, you cannot
say anything to him.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.400
- Of course not.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.317
Ah. Good news.

15:27.317 --> 15:29.189
Donor lungs
just became available.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.538
"Happy birthday, Daddy,"
indeed.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.984
The donor's upstairs
on life support.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.551
His family is ready
to withdraw care.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.249
We'll take you
for some additional testing,

15:46.249 --> 15:48.425
but the transplant could happen
as soon as tomorrow.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.166
Wow.
- You'll need a bedroom
on the ground floor

15:50.166 --> 15:52.168
and an easily
accessible bathroom.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.040
I can convert my office.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.868
As long as you have privacy
elsewhere for your <i>work.</i>

15:56.868 --> 15:59.436
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why'd you say "work" like that?

15:59.436 --> 16:02.570
I mean, how much privacy do you
need for tech consultations?

16:04.398 --> 16:06.791
Charlie's speech pattern
can be a bit unusual.

16:06.791 --> 16:07.923
Her autism is awesome.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.011
Thank you.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.579
Don't mention it. Really.
Do not.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.276
Love you, Daddy.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.365
So many daddies,
so little time.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.801
Whoa, whoa.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.152
What does that mean?

16:20.501 --> 16:21.981
Uh, Dad, nothing.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.591
I'm not asking you.
I'm asking her.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.162
Saying "observe" isn't enough.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.294
You need to tell them,
"Don't speak."

16:31.294 --> 16:33.427
I realize that now.
So does The Dominator.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.474
What are your thoughts
about the TCR?

16:37.474 --> 16:38.998
You're considering the surgery?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.348
It's either that or do nothing
and Sal is dead in a year.

16:41.348 --> 16:44.829
A year is a year.
You're not his executioner.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.048
So you wouldn't do it?

16:46.048 --> 16:48.050
No, I'm not making
this decision for you.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.834
You're an attending now.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.227
Your surgery, your call.

17:00.454 --> 17:01.846
What are you doing?

17:01.846 --> 17:03.761
Work order says
deliver them here.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.198
Signed by the president.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.204
Co... president.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.078
Once Rich's questions
picked up speed,

17:16.078 --> 17:18.559
it wasn't long before
Charlie mentioned "sex worker."

17:18.559 --> 17:21.040
Shortly thereafter,
he banned Grace from the room
and called off the surgery.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.868
Okay.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.523
His oxygen saturation
is decreasing.

17:26.523 --> 17:29.004
He is profoundly hypoxic.
Rich needs new lungs now.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.092
I told him that.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.485
He booked a flight
back to Florida.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.226
Said he'll get
on the transplant list there.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.532
No, no, no. His lungs
cannot handle transport.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.230
Charlie's mistake
is endangering
our patient's health.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.754
Our patient is doing that
all on his own.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.017
But Rich would not be upset
if Charlie had not revealed--

17:42.017 --> 17:43.932
She didn't violate
any HIPAA laws.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.238
The only thing she did wrong

17:45.238 --> 17:47.457
was not keep Grace's
secret life a secret.

17:47.457 --> 17:50.243
Which kind of sounds like
something you might have done

17:50.243 --> 17:52.462
back in your first year.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.289
Hmm.

17:57.337 --> 18:00.035
Our patient needs a bilateral
whole-lung lavage

18:00.035 --> 18:01.732
in order to get home safely.

18:01.732 --> 18:02.864
Please get his consent.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.519
Charlie can do scut work.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.524
Dissecting the tumor
from the ventral surface

18:10.524 --> 18:11.742
of the pons and cranial nerves.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.486
Applied too much pressure.
Bleeder.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.141
- Oh, God.
- What? Dom,

18:19.141 --> 18:20.360
it's not even real.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.101
- Oh, God.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.319
Again?

18:23.319 --> 18:24.973
- Again.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.759
Have you eaten?

18:28.759 --> 18:30.109
Two double cheeseburgers,

18:30.109 --> 18:31.849
fries, coleslaw,
cottage cheese,

18:31.849 --> 18:33.112
a pudding, and fruit salad.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.551
You know, hemophobia can make

18:37.551 --> 18:40.075
for a pretty rough
surgical rotation.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.120
You got any idea
how to get over it?

18:42.425 --> 18:43.731
I gotta.

18:43.731 --> 18:46.342
My brother and I,
we have this deal

18:46.342 --> 18:48.170
to become family docs,
then move back home.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.086
When our mother got sick,

18:51.086 --> 18:52.131
we saw how lousy
medical care can get.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.570
You could try exposure therapy,

18:56.570 --> 18:58.006
watch a few hours
of blood draws.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.748
- Ooh, there's a twist.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.010
You good?

19:02.010 --> 19:03.490
Okay. Just breathe.

19:35.304 --> 19:38.133
Shaun <i>doesn't</i> like her?
But she worships him.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.395
Charlie blabbed to the patient,

19:39.395 --> 19:41.484
blew up his double
lung transplant.

19:41.484 --> 19:44.270
Double lumen
endotracheal tubes and clamps.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.315
My guy did the same thing,
but in reverse.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.969
Mentioned a virtually
impossible surgery.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.753
Now the patient wants it.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.626
I think
I actually saw smoke
come out of Park's ears.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.628
Well, 20% of med school
students don't make it,

19:54.628 --> 19:56.499
and most of that happens
during surgical rotation.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.806
I wonder which one
of our ducklings goes first?

19:58.806 --> 19:59.894
Ten bags of saline.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.290
Oh, you're gonna need a cart.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.294
The big guy's on a mission.
I'll take the girl.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.644
I've never said
those words before.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.688
Done with my scut work.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.430
You guys need a cart.

20:15.562 --> 20:16.780
I'll be right back.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.224
Hey.

20:28.139 --> 20:31.578
Are you not going to go
to Morgan's baby thing
because I might be there?

20:32.492 --> 20:33.493
Yes.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.452
Well, that's pretty dumb.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.674
Don't you think it's time
we moved past this stuff?

20:40.674 --> 20:41.588
No.

20:42.763 --> 20:43.938
Well, I'm trying to.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.028
I'm the one
who should be mad at you.

20:48.899 --> 20:52.076
You should have met Steve
on the day he was born.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.601
Yes. I should have.
I should have done that.

20:56.777 --> 20:59.258
I was pretty upset back then.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.957
You humiliated me,

21:02.957 --> 21:05.829
and I'm not a surgeon now
partly because of you.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.442
Did you forget that?

21:13.184 --> 21:16.971
That is not an apology.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.292
Drained ninth liter
of effluent.

21:34.771 --> 21:37.600
Left lung output
is looking clearer.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.341
<i>Did everyone
look at Grace's cam-girl site?</i>

21:40.995 --> 21:42.692
What is she doing here?

21:43.606 --> 21:45.695
She was done with scut work.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.915
Infusing another liter
of saline.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.483
<i>Grace put herself online
because she wants customers.</i>

21:50.483 --> 21:52.049
<i>I'm giving her what she wants.</i>

21:52.049 --> 21:53.964
You actually subscribed?

21:53.964 --> 21:55.966
<i>I am a feminist,
and she's very beautiful.</i>

21:55.966 --> 21:59.013
<i>Her site offers
tasteful nude portraits,</i>

21:59.013 --> 22:00.710
<i>sensual shower videos,
and gritty bondage.</i>

22:00.710 --> 22:03.365
No amount of money
is worth selling your body.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.193
<i>Uh, $3.6 million a year
might be.</i>

22:06.063 --> 22:07.717
What about you, Dr. Murphy?

22:07.717 --> 22:09.458
How would you feel if your son
ended up doing sex work?

22:13.244 --> 22:14.768
<i>What if he ends up sick</i>

22:14.768 --> 22:16.509
<i>from cutting quartz countertops
for a living?</i>

22:22.384 --> 22:25.213
We can clear Rich to fly home.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.041
But I need
to talk to him first.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.231
How long ago did she wake up?

22:43.231 --> 22:45.581
About an hour or so.
I just fed her.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.469
The patient wants to go for it,

23:03.469 --> 23:07.168
and there's a non-zero
chance it works.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.737
So do it.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.869
Only the best of the best
could pull this off.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.568
And what if that's you?

23:18.745 --> 23:21.008
I've been in the OR with you.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.401
I know your steadiness,

23:22.401 --> 23:25.447
your precision,
your persistence.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.193
I believe you can do this.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.419
Maybe Eden should decide.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.291
She agrees with her mama.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.046
You are able to fly home now.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.703
But you should listen
to your daughter.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.234
Dad.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.365
Please.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.847
Dr. Murphy says
it's very unlikely

24:17.847 --> 24:19.719
they'll find
another donor match
before you die.

24:21.068 --> 24:21.851
Take the lungs.

24:24.854 --> 24:27.944
You don't have to live with me.
I'll find a place for you.

24:30.773 --> 24:31.905
You have to stop
what you're doing.

24:35.909 --> 24:36.692
No.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.087
I like what I do.

24:40.087 --> 24:43.046
I'm successful,
and I'm not hurting anyone.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.005
You're hurting me.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.984
My son, Steve,
is three weeks old.

25:10.247 --> 25:13.294
I have been thinking about what
he might do when he gets older

25:13.294 --> 25:15.383
that I would not approve of.

25:18.299 --> 25:21.781
But I can't imagine
not wanting him in my life

25:23.434 --> 25:25.698
unless he was cruel
or unkind to others.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.441
She is kind and generous.

25:30.441 --> 25:32.487
She loves you
and wants to care for you.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.315
She seems like
a very good person.

25:39.407 --> 25:40.669
You did raise Grace right.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.078
You're a gambling addict
who showed up here

25:58.078 --> 25:59.558
having already
thrown everything away.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.735
The only way I do this surgery

26:02.735 --> 26:05.433
is if I know
you'll make better use
of the extra time.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.045
- This doesn't seem ethical.
- It's not.

26:13.267 --> 26:15.574
Convince me
you'll lead a life
worth saving.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.715
My name is Sal Zacharia,

26:26.715 --> 26:27.977
and I have
a gambling addiction.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.025
I promise I will get treatment.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.637
And you'll reach out
to your ex-wife,

26:35.637 --> 26:36.899
try to reconnect
with your family.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.205
How is this any business
of yours?

26:44.690 --> 26:46.430
Tell me
why I should believe you.

26:54.525 --> 26:57.180
Because I die if you don't.

27:04.274 --> 27:05.449
I don't wanna die.

27:13.457 --> 27:14.676
Let's get prepped for surgery.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.910
Scrub your arms
to three inches
above the elbow.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.042
How did you get Rich
to change his mind?

27:33.042 --> 27:34.174
Did you trick him?

27:34.174 --> 27:36.089
I related to him as a father.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.917
I have become very good
at displaying empathy.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.093
Neurotypicals are weird.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.529
Yes, they are.

27:41.529 --> 27:44.227
Rinse your hands and arms
from fingertips to elbows,

27:44.227 --> 27:46.752
one direction only.

27:46.752 --> 27:51.147
I am displaying empathy now,
by allowing you into the OR.

27:51.147 --> 27:53.759
You should be grateful
I was able to fix the case.

27:53.759 --> 27:54.803
Hands up,
and don't touch anything.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.768
My first time
being gowned and gloved.

28:02.768 --> 28:03.986
Do we get to shave his chest?

28:03.986 --> 28:05.596
It was done in pre-op.

28:05.596 --> 28:09.209
Oh, I shave my own body hair,
so I'm great at it.

28:09.209 --> 28:10.819
Not my chest, though.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.821
- I mean, my underarms,
my legs, my--
Charlie.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.780
Okay.
Please stop talking.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.695
I... I, uh,
was just trying to...

28:19.828 --> 28:23.440
You cannot
touch your skin.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.965
I didn't,
I touched my earring.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.749
You can't touch
any non-sterile item.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.364
You've just contaminated
the surgical field.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.018
You have to re-scrub in,

28:36.018 --> 28:38.586
and we have to re-drape
everything.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.806
- You're speaking very loudly.
- Go read the literature

28:40.806 --> 28:43.156
on operating-room
sterile technique.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.288
That won't help.
I'm an auditory learner.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.726
You need to leave.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.641
Okay? Leave now.

29:02.436 --> 29:03.524
That looks fun.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.790
Why did you e-mail
"Will not attend"?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.705
You're clearly
skipping my baby's party

29:10.705 --> 29:12.446
because you feel
like a failure as a mom.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.708
But you're not.
And that's stupid.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.057
And how can I help
if you won't just tell me

29:15.057 --> 29:16.667
that you're having
breastfeeding problems?

29:17.451 --> 29:19.148
Mm. I'm sorry.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.716
I feel like a jerk complaining
to you about all of this.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.631
I know I'm lucky
to breastfeed at all,

29:23.631 --> 29:25.851
and I am not being rational.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.550
You're not
the only one failing.

29:34.076 --> 29:36.949
When Eden cries
during the night,

29:36.949 --> 29:38.689
Alex is the one who wakes up.

29:39.386 --> 29:40.909
Every time.

29:40.909 --> 29:42.737
During one
of his overnight shifts,

29:42.737 --> 29:46.785
I slept through my own baby
crying for almost 20 minutes.

29:46.785 --> 29:50.223
I mean, that's actual neglect.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.531
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
Child Protective Services
is downstairs.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.272
Shut up, raisin boobs.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.144
Mm.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.844
You are the greatest mom.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.021
Adopting a baby
with Turner syndrome,

30:06.021 --> 30:08.110
caring for her
after two heart surgeries,

30:08.110 --> 30:10.591
and somehow throwing a party
while being so put together.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.594
And I use formula exclusively.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.825
Finally got the last box
removed from my office.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.872
- Space is a little tight.
- And yet, I found some.

30:30.872 --> 30:34.528
Well, that's excellent use
of your co-presidential powers.

30:34.528 --> 30:37.226
- I owe you.
- Oh, my God,
can we please stop?

30:37.226 --> 30:40.229
Can we...
Can we just have a truce?

30:40.229 --> 30:42.057
- I'll think about it.
- Please?

30:42.057 --> 30:43.972
I promise, from here on in,

30:43.972 --> 30:46.105
I will check in
with all the big stuff.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.454
Okay?

30:47.454 --> 30:49.543
No more gotchas.

30:49.543 --> 30:51.110
Happy birthday!

30:53.112 --> 30:54.853
I sent the memo out
this morning.

30:56.724 --> 30:57.899
Eighty?

31:00.075 --> 31:02.208
You look really good
for your age.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.138
I got booted out
of my first surgery

31:19.138 --> 31:20.922
for contaminating
the sterile field.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.706
I'm probably about to join you.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.273
I fainted twice
at the sight of blood.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.493
I'm already sweating
and seeing little black dots.

31:26.493 --> 31:29.626
- What?
- Feel better?

31:29.626 --> 31:32.107
That activated your sympathetic
nervous system.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.892
More blood flow
means you won't faint.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.156
Too bad I can't
do that to myself.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.897
Try snapping your glove
against your wrist.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.744
All right.
Let's cut.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.208
Stair-step mandibulotomy
complete.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.558
Dr. Wolke, dissect to the floor
of the mouth posteriorly,

32:31.558 --> 32:33.734
then swing the tongue medially
and the mandible laterally.

32:36.084 --> 32:39.870
Transecting eustachian tube
and elevating the pharynx

32:39.870 --> 32:40.828
off the longus colli muscles.

32:43.091 --> 32:46.138
We now have access
to the upper cervical spine
and clivus.

32:48.836 --> 32:49.968
Now comes the hard part.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.628
Bring the Fabricius robot in.
Get the arms in position.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.979
Have the Rhoton dissector
and ultrasonic aspirator ready.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.310
25-degree angled
Rhoton dissector.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.104
Dissecting a safe plane
between the tumor

33:39.104 --> 33:41.193
and the ventral surface
of the pons and cranial nerve.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.464
Final step.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.292
Too deep here and the guy's
permanently paralyzed.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.281
All tumor's out.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.419
And heart is still beating.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.314
I'm not okay.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.499
Dad.
- Hmm?

35:11.587 --> 35:13.285
Hey.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.808
Hey! You're here.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.115
Of course.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.554
How do you feel?

35:24.209 --> 35:26.298
Like I can breathe again.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.823
Good.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.912
I found a place that can help
with your meals and medicine.

35:40.616 --> 35:41.791
You know, I...

35:41.791 --> 35:43.184
I'd really like
to stay with you.

35:46.361 --> 35:49.016
If the offer still stands.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.152
Of course it does.

35:54.804 --> 35:55.892
Yeah?

35:55.892 --> 35:57.024
Yeah.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.339
You're a good person.

36:24.094 --> 36:25.705
Hello.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.489
I would like a report
on what you've learned

36:27.489 --> 36:29.404
from the sterile techniques
manual.

36:29.404 --> 36:30.492
I'll e-mail it.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.625
I'm reorganizing
for peak efficiency.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.670
Making a great day greater.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.762
No. Excuse me.
Today was not a great day.

36:39.762 --> 36:42.069
Nor was yesterday.

36:42.069 --> 36:46.334
You made several big mistakes
and dozens of small ones.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.641
My anatomy professor told us
it's okay to make mistakes.

36:48.641 --> 36:49.381
That's how we learn.

36:50.425 --> 36:51.600
Your professor is wrong.

36:52.645 --> 36:55.300
And so is this re-organization.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.215
I had everything
in the proper place.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.653
Restore it, then go home.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.628
Looks like we both
caught a break.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.455
Mm.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.110
Hmm.

37:25.721 --> 37:26.940
Is Janet your ex-wife?

37:29.595 --> 37:30.987
Nice.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.380
Looks like she's pretty excited

37:32.380 --> 37:33.512
about you getting
into treatment.

37:33.512 --> 37:34.382
Mm.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.130
And you got a confirmation
for the bets you just placed.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.463
Good luck, Sal.

38:38.098 --> 38:39.099
You okay?

38:40.883 --> 38:43.321
Dr. Murphy doesn't appreciate
efficient organization skills

38:43.321 --> 38:44.365
when he sees it.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.414
Hmm.

38:49.414 --> 38:50.545
I do.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.069
That doesn't matter very much.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.332
You're not my hero.

39:01.991 --> 39:02.905
Sure about that?

39:07.301 --> 39:08.868

39:42.031 --> 39:43.293
You're so sweet.

- You were right.

39:48.342 --> 39:49.387
No guilt, okay?

39:50.170 --> 39:52.302
I'm proud of you.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.261
Also, supplementing
has advantages for Mama.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.830
Bless your dear, dear soul.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.969
Because we've had
a long couple of days

40:06.969 --> 40:08.406
with our new babies.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.456
My first med school rotation
was oncology.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.632
I was doing patient intake,
and I asked a woman

40:17.632 --> 40:19.112
if she'd been keeping up
with her mammograms.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.289
It was a follow-up
to a double mastectomy.

40:26.032 --> 40:27.947
Mine was obstetrics.

40:27.947 --> 40:29.731
It was my first delivery,

40:29.731 --> 40:31.472
and the doctor handed me
the newborn,

40:31.472 --> 40:34.170
and I said, "Ew,"
like, out loud.

40:36.390 --> 40:39.045
When I was in my first
ever surgery, open heart,

40:39.045 --> 40:41.700
the attending asked me
what the ACT was.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.441
I proudly said,
"Activated clotting time."

40:44.746 --> 40:46.269
She said,
"I know what it stands for.

40:46.269 --> 40:47.096
"I need you
to tell me the number."

40:47.096 --> 40:49.098
- Wow.

40:49.098 --> 40:52.145
Mm-hmm. That attending could
have thrown me out of the OR.

40:52.145 --> 40:53.451
But she mentored me instead.

40:54.843 --> 40:55.714
Yeah.

40:58.107 --> 40:59.544
To taking care
of our ducklings.

40:59.544 --> 41:00.632
Yeah.

41:12.818 --> 41:16.561
I have heard valid arguments
both for and against sex work.

41:17.997 --> 41:19.477
Are you considering
a career change?

41:19.477 --> 41:20.826
But it doesn't matter.

41:22.567 --> 41:25.831
It is okay for family
to disagree.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.791
Being a family who argues

41:29.791 --> 41:33.142
is more important
than not being a family at all.

41:36.755 --> 41:38.626
I'm sorry it took me
so long to meet you.

41:40.628 --> 41:42.543
I look forward to spending
some more time together.

41:43.762 --> 41:44.502
Okay?

41:47.548 --> 41:48.941
He was saying that for me.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.423
