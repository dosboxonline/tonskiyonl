WEBVTT

00:38.995 --> 00:40.736
Shit.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.433
Hello?

00:42.433 --> 00:43.826
NAOMI [over phone]:
Andy.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.784
Yeah. Naomi?

00:45.784 --> 00:48.613
W-Wait, where are you?
How come you're not home?

00:48.613 --> 00:50.180
I'm-I'm sorry to wake you

00:50.180 --> 00:51.486
in the middle of the night.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.183
Hey, what's going on?
Where are you?

00:53.183 --> 00:54.924
Listen, I'm gonna tell you,

00:54.924 --> 00:57.492
but I don't want you
to freak out, okay?

00:57.492 --> 00:59.233
Wait a minute, freak out?

00:59.233 --> 01:00.756
What's going on?
You're scaring me.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.497
Are you okay?

01:02.497 --> 01:05.282
Yeah. No, I'm okay. Um...

01:05.282 --> 01:06.849
I'm gonna be fine.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.807
But, Andy...

01:08.807 --> 01:10.722
I'm in rehab.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.594
No, hon, seriously,
where are you?

01:12.594 --> 01:15.031
-I'm in rehab.
- You're what?!

01:15.031 --> 01:17.599
No... [stammers] That's
why I said don't freak out!

01:17.599 --> 01:19.905
Okay? I checked myself in,
like, an hour ago.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.820
Didn't you notice
I didn't come home?

01:21.820 --> 01:24.562
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Wait.

01:24.562 --> 01:25.998
Wait a minute.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.783
What are you talking about?

01:27.783 --> 01:28.958
Why would you...

01:28.958 --> 01:30.873
Why would you be in rehab?
For what?

01:30.873 --> 01:33.702
Because I need help,
Andy. Why else?

01:33.702 --> 01:36.313
Wait a minute. What...

01:36.313 --> 01:38.228
Wait a minute.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.535
What are you talking-- I don't
understand. -Okay, hold on.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.319
- Are you telling me--
- Help with what?

01:42.319 --> 01:44.974
This is amazing.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.802
- You didn't know?
- Know what?

01:46.802 --> 01:48.586
- Oh, my God. Unbelievable.
-  Naomi, I don't know--

01:48.586 --> 01:50.414
- Unbelievable.
- I-I-I don't--

01:50.414 --> 01:52.112
Of course. -Thought you were
lying there in bed with me.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.461
No, I don't know...

01:53.461 --> 01:55.376
Honey. Honey, look.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.768
Naomi, look,

01:56.768 --> 01:58.727
sometimes you probably drink
a little too much.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.642
- Oh, Andy, come on.
- It's not good, I know.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.339
But, you know,
everybody does that.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.950
- But rehab? You're crazy.
- No, it's not--

02:04.950 --> 02:07.127
It-- Listen,
it is not the drinking.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.129
I have to take something
to wake up. -What?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.131
And I take something
to go to sleep.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.916
And I... I've seen
every doctor in L.A.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.570
I even had to drive
to Orange County.

02:15.570 --> 02:18.312
Orange County? What the--
You... [stammers] -Yeah.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.009
Wait a minute. This is, like...

02:20.009 --> 02:23.230
Honestly, honestly, I'm
telling you, this is so insane.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.145
I feel like I'm hallucinating
or something.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.277
Of course you didn't know.
Of course you didn't know.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.409
Why would you know?

02:28.409 --> 02:29.845
You're out the door
every morning

02:29.845 --> 02:31.020
before I can get a word in,

02:31.020 --> 02:32.717
and you're out every night
for work.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.980
We lead totally separate lives,
and I'm just...

02:34.980 --> 02:37.200
- I'm invisible.
-  So this is my fault?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.463
How can you know nothing
about my life?

02:39.463 --> 02:41.639
I have this enormous weight,

02:41.639 --> 02:44.033
and I've been carrying it
around for so long.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.556
And I cannot do it anymore.

02:45.556 --> 02:46.905
Wai-Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.038
Wait. Okay.
This is just not true.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.606
- How can you say that?
- This is just not true.

02:51.606 --> 02:52.607
Then enlighten me.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.217
<i>Okay. You're upset.</i>

02:54.217 --> 02:57.002
<i>I get that.
But, h-honey, I know you.</i>

02:57.002 --> 02:58.961
<i>You're a wonderful mother.</i>

02:58.961 --> 03:01.137
I'm sorry.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.313
- The woman I live with...
- Andy.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.662
...doesn't have
a drug addiction. -Andy.

03:04.662 --> 03:06.969
- You just don't.
- Hey. Hey.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.275
You're not hearing me.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.537
You're not listening to me.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.452
I've checked into
a rehabilitation center

03:11.452 --> 03:12.975
- called Journeys.
- Journeys?

03:12.975 --> 03:14.803
It's on Malibu Canyon Road.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.371
It has yellow walls and a woman
at the front desk named Cecile,

03:17.371 --> 03:19.677
and I am staying here
for 90 days. -

03:19.677 --> 03:20.896
Wait a minute. What?

03:20.896 --> 03:22.811
- I got to go.
- 90 days?

03:22.811 --> 03:25.074
- Take care of the kids, Andy.
- 90 days?

03:25.074 --> 03:26.118
You'll do great.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.729
Wait, no. No, no, no.

03:27.729 --> 03:28.991
I'm coming up right now.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.471
Just stay put, and we'll talk.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.299
NAOMI [distorted]:
No, don't come...

03:32.299 --> 03:34.953
Can't-- I can't hear you.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.346
Wait, you're cutting out.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.087
No, I said don't come, Andy.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.611
Look, look, h-here, I'll be
up there in an hour. -No.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.613
I'll be up there in an hour.
We'll drive back down here

03:42.613 --> 03:44.180
and we'll talk about it.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.400
Andy, do-do not come.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.228
I am... you.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.360
I c-- I can't hear you.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.797
I'm leaving you.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.800
What?

03:55.800 --> 03:59.326
I'm leaving you!

04:15.342 --> 04:16.952
-

04:16.952 --> 04:18.997
...deep breaths,
in and out, in and out.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.738
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.479
I'm sorry I'm late. -No, no,
it's okay. Don't worry.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.089
Hi. -I wish we could
start without you. Hi.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.482
- Mm.
- So how did it go?

04:25.482 --> 04:26.918
I don't know
why this is still a thing.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.180
I should not be this afraid

04:28.180 --> 04:30.270
to tell my female boss
that I'm pregnant.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.272
Uh, Grace,
this happens every day.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.230
Come. Flip with me.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.014
Okay.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.103
- Okay.
- Hello, both of you!

04:38.103 --> 04:40.671
Hi. -Dr. Verma,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.283
Oh, that is
totally, totally fine.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.327
Okay.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.676
How are you two doing?

04:45.676 --> 04:48.113
Actually, I'm-I'm having
really bad heartburn.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.028
- Oh, no.
- Here.

04:50.028 --> 04:52.030
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that, um... is that normal?

04:52.030 --> 04:53.728
- Uh...
- Well, we had Thai last night.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.382
Couldn't that be why?
I think it could be why.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.210
-I would just
avoid fried food or spicy food

04:58.210 --> 05:00.169
- at this stage.
-Okay.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.779
Well, let's just add that
to the list.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.390
No spicy food, no fried food,

05:03.390 --> 05:04.695
no caffeine, no alcohol,

05:04.695 --> 05:06.001
- no sushi...
- No sex.

05:07.132 --> 05:08.743
Actually, perfectly fine
to have sex.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.048
Good, even.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.920
I knew it. I'm-I'm a doctor,
for God's sake.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.401
'Kay. -Mwah. I knew that
wasn't true. -

05:14.705 --> 05:16.098
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.056
All right.
Just take a look, shall we?

05:19.971 --> 05:22.017
Do you hear that sound?

05:22.017 --> 05:25.063
It's the sound of
a perfectly healthy heartbeat.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.765
- Just answer him.
- No, baby.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.375
It's fine. It's okay.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.029
Grace, my advice to
you, as always, is relax.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.944
Everything looks fantastic.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.641
And I will see you guys back
in a month.

05:37.641 --> 05:38.990
-Great.
- Okay. Thank you.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.818
-Of course.
-Oh, Dr. Verma,

05:40.818 --> 05:42.037
- can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Will you follow me?

05:42.037 --> 05:43.604
- You good?
- Yeah. For sure.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.869
What's up, Dad?

05:47.869 --> 05:49.479
Naomi's in rehab.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.611
What?

05:50.611 --> 05:54.049
She's addicted to pills, apparently.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.094
And-and-and she's left me.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.053
We're separated, I guess.
Jesus.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.228
Wait, seriously?

05:59.228 --> 06:00.360
Yes. Seriously.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.710
What about the twins?
Do they know?

06:03.885 --> 06:05.582
I'll talk to them tonight.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.367
- Dad.
- I will. I already told them

06:07.367 --> 06:10.239
Naomi had a doctor's
appointment this morning.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.938
You didn't seem really
surprised when I told you

06:13.938 --> 06:15.113
Naomi's in rehab.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.072
Did you suspect something
about her?

06:17.072 --> 06:20.118
I don't know. I guess it's not,
like, that big of a shocker.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.730
Not a shocker?
What's that mean?

06:22.730 --> 06:24.384
Oh, look, uh,
let me-- let me... -Hey.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.776
...let me call you back
from the car, okay? -Let's go.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.387
- I-I got to go.
-Okay. But, wait,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
did you know
she was taking pills?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.868
Dad, I got to go.
I'll call you right back.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.261
God, is there traffic
all the time? -

06:32.261 --> 06:33.741
What is it? What's he want?

06:33.741 --> 06:37.135
Well, so, Naomi checked herself
into rehab

06:37.135 --> 06:38.354
and she left him.

06:38.354 --> 06:39.442
Stop. What...

06:39.442 --> 06:41.139
Wait, wait,
what's she in rehab for?

06:41.139 --> 06:42.532
Prescription drugs, I think.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.316
How did he not tell you
about this before?

06:44.316 --> 06:46.144
'Cause he didn't know.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.973
Who doesn't know that
their wife is addicted to drugs?

06:51.672 --> 06:53.108
What the fuck?

06:53.108 --> 06:55.023
This looks like a country club.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.764
Jesus.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.423
Hi. I'm Andy Goodrich,

07:03.423 --> 07:05.512
and I'm here to see
Naomi Parsons.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.165
She checked in last night.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.776
Hello.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.604
Oh. Hi.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.170
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

07:12.170 --> 07:15.347
All right,
let me check on that for you.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.827
And Ms. Parsons
is expecting you?

07:16.827 --> 07:18.655
Yeah. No.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.265
I mean, not really.
But I'm her husband.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.571
- So...
- Right.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.399
Well, I am so sorry,
Mr. Goodrich.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.270
We're not at liberty
to confirm or deny

07:25.270 --> 07:26.968
that Ms. Parsons is here.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.883
No, I know she's here.
I mean...

07:28.883 --> 07:31.407
I mean, I know she's here
'cause she told me she's here.

07:31.407 --> 07:34.715
I didn't know
that she was checking in,

07:34.715 --> 07:36.020
- so yeah.
- And I understand that.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.282
And I will let her know

07:37.282 --> 07:38.588
that you've stopped in.

07:38.588 --> 07:41.069
Well, no, just tell her
I'm here now.

07:41.069 --> 07:41.983
I mean, you don't have to--

07:41.983 --> 07:43.941
Here I am now. Just-just...

07:43.941 --> 07:46.378
let her know. -I wish I could,
but I just can't.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.729
Do you have, like,
some sort of a...

07:48.729 --> 07:50.818
I don't know, say, somebody...

07:50.818 --> 07:53.037
- a little higher up? Yeah.
- Oh. Yeah, sure.

07:53.037 --> 07:55.779
And I'm afraid she's just
gonna tell you that Ms. Parsons

07:55.779 --> 07:58.913
has pulled both her and
our consent to speak with you.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.305
Okay.

08:00.305 --> 08:01.481
Okay, look--

08:01.481 --> 08:03.526
I can leave a message.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.485
- I'll leave a message.
- Okay.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.790
I want to see my fucking wife!

08:06.790 --> 08:09.097
-I'm sorry.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.492
- Hello?
-Hi.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.972
I'm calling from Crosswinds
Park Elementary School.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.800
- Yeah.
- Is somebody coming

08:16.800 --> 08:18.280
to pick up Billie and Mose?

08:18.280 --> 08:20.108
- BILLIE and MOSE: Dad.
- Sorry. I said I was sorry.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.457
I mean, what do you want me
to say? -

08:21.457 --> 08:23.067
I didn't realize
it was a half day,

08:23.067 --> 08:24.634
and I was far away, so...

08:24.634 --> 08:26.680
It's just so embarrassing
not getting picked up.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.812
I mean, it's, like,
pretty much the worst feeling

08:28.812 --> 08:31.119
- in the entire world.
- It's like the worst feeling

08:31.119 --> 08:33.513
in the entire world
or it is the worst feeling

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
in the entire world? -Hey,
if you don't want me to talk

08:35.515 --> 08:37.299
like I'm from L.A.,
don't raise me in L.A.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.605
Hey, hey, hey, don't do that.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.128
You're gonna scratch
the dining room table.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.259
Come on.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.565
Where's Mom?

08:42.565 --> 08:44.306
She would never forget.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.960
Yeah, and Mom always leaves
a glass of water

08:45.960 --> 08:48.615
by my bed at night,
and she didn't last night.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.181
Yeah.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.923
I-I wanted to tell you guys
something about Mom, okay?

08:52.923 --> 08:54.490
Uh...

08:54.490 --> 08:56.361
What gives?

08:56.361 --> 08:58.973
Mom had to go back home
for a little while

08:58.973 --> 09:00.365
to see Grandma.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.671
Mom's in St. Louis?

09:01.671 --> 09:02.846
I thought you said she had

09:02.846 --> 09:05.066
a doctor's appointment
this morning.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.371
Yeah. No.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.199
I'm sorry. I said that
because I didn't...

09:08.199 --> 09:10.071
want you guys to worry.

09:10.071 --> 09:13.378
But Mom had to go back and see
Grandma because, you know,

09:13.378 --> 09:14.684
she's not feeling very well.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.686
It's nothing serious,
but, you know, sh...

09:16.686 --> 09:19.036
And, you know,
she's getting older,

09:19.036 --> 09:21.430
so Mom wanted to go back and be
with her for a little bit.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.214
Grandma's the same age as you.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.129
No, she's not.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.783
No, she's not. She... Sh...

09:26.783 --> 09:28.916
Good deal older than I am.
But, anyway...

09:28.916 --> 09:31.614
So, it's just gonna be us then?

09:31.614 --> 09:32.876
Yeah.

09:32.876 --> 09:33.747
Just us.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.487
It's gonna be fun, right?

09:35.487 --> 09:36.532
Be good.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.839
Right?

09:39.491 --> 09:40.884
I'm gonna go play <i>Forza.</i>

09:40.884 --> 09:42.582
Hey, wait, I get to use
the computer first today!

09:42.582 --> 09:44.192
Whoever gets to it first
gets to use it first.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.323
You used it two days
over the weekend.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.934
I did not...

09:46.934 --> 09:48.196
Mom says
we're not supposed to have

09:48.196 --> 09:49.719
this much gluten, you know.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.199
She says it's bad for our guts.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.504
Honey, honey, honey.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.594
Put a paper towel down.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.812
You have to respect wood.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.641
It sounds like
Mom's maybe making you...

09:58.641 --> 10:00.208
a little bit crazy.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.165
Tell you why.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.603
'Cause gluten happens to be...

10:03.603 --> 10:05.256
delicious.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.606
Mmm!

10:06.606 --> 10:07.694
That's some good gluten.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.740
Okay, want me
to make you a plate?

10:10.740 --> 10:12.873
- Um, we do it ourselves.
- Okay.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.440
Well, then bon appétit!

10:17.051 --> 10:19.009
Dad, are there nuts in that?

10:19.009 --> 10:20.968
- Why? Are you allergic?
- Mose is.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.144
Mose. Oh, shit, I forgot.
Jesus, spit.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.275
Spit, spit. Here, gimme.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.450
- Mose. Give it to me.
- Oh, my God.

10:25.450 --> 10:28.018
- Spit. Spit.
- Come on! Dad.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.585
Jesus.

10:31.239 --> 10:34.938
Pasta with butter and cheese.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.898
- Specialty of the house.
- Mom puts salt in the water.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.813
Good tip. That's a good tip.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.553
Salt, salt, salt, salt.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.467
I see pepper.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.339
- I don't see--
- Top shelf.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.341
Oh.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.866
Kind of far for salt.

10:50.345 --> 10:53.391
Here you go. Some salt.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.917
Hey, Dad,
can we watch TV while we eat?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.788
Can't we just talk?

10:58.788 --> 11:00.485
I'm going out tonight, and...

11:00.485 --> 11:01.661
and, uh...

11:01.661 --> 11:03.184
I don't know.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.316
Just rather spend time together
before I go out.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.622
Where are you going?

11:06.622 --> 11:08.319
- Got a thing.
- What kind of thing?

11:08.319 --> 11:09.669
Dinner thing.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.627
- We're eating dinner right now.
- I know.

11:11.627 --> 11:12.802
But this is a dinner-work thing.

11:12.802 --> 11:13.803
I'm gonna meet a new artist.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.240
- Who's babysitting us?
- Tali.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.286
Did you know
Tali was in the Israeli army?

11:18.286 --> 11:19.722
That's why I hired her.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.681
Did you know that
she smokes cigarettes outside?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.987
That's new information.
Thank you.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.772
I'm gonna talk to her
about that.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.688
This about the smoking?
She's a narc, that little girl.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.386
No, it's not about the smoking,
but, you know, if you could,

11:31.386 --> 11:34.171
you know, maybe do a few less
cancer-causing habits

11:34.171 --> 11:36.826
around the kids, that'd be
a good thing, okay? -

11:36.826 --> 11:40.787
No, uh,
what I wanted to say is...

11:42.179 --> 11:44.138
Naomi's gone away.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.705
And, uh...

11:45.705 --> 11:47.271
I'm gonna need an extra hand.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.359
No problem.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.578
Where she go? Rehab?

11:49.578 --> 11:50.927
You knew about this?

11:50.927 --> 11:53.582
Andy, of course I know.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.801
Course I know. Good for her.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.498
It's good. She's getting help.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.760
Why are you stressed?

11:58.935 --> 12:00.154
You didn't know?

12:00.154 --> 12:02.460
- I didn't know.
- Ah.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.114
Andy, this is not good.

12:04.114 --> 12:06.769
I know. -Listen,
I'll help, okay? I understand.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.510
- Marriage is tough, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.512
My-my husband is a gay.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.819
What do you mean
your husband is a gay?

12:12.819 --> 12:13.907
Eh, my husband is gay.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.343
He lives in Tel Aviv.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.736
Very good-looking boyfriend.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.650
I mean, uh, mamash wow!

12:18.650 --> 12:20.043
Don't blame him.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.175
Wait a minute, he's a gay?

12:21.175 --> 12:22.698
He's got a--
he's got a boyfriend?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.352
- Why are you still together?
- Why not?

12:24.352 --> 12:25.570
Andy, loosen up.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.441
What time you'll be home?

12:26.441 --> 12:28.138
3:00, 4:00 in the morning?

12:28.138 --> 12:29.531
No. Like, 11:00.

12:29.531 --> 12:30.750
What do you mean,
3:00 in the morning? -Okay.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.457
- Hey! Becca. You're back.
- Hey!

12:42.457 --> 12:43.980
Yes. -How you doing?
How you feeling?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.416
- So much better.
- Good, good.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.636
- Thanks, Andy.
- I'm glad you're back.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.769
Hey. Careful.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.771
Don't drop that, boys.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.989
Yeah.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.904
Perfect.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.778
- Good.
-Oh, good, you're here.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.909
Finally.

12:59.909 --> 13:00.823
The sign outside.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.085
Yeah.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.783
Killing me. Looks horrible.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.045
Worse every day.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.524
Get me a second quote
for a new one, okay?

13:06.524 --> 13:07.612
8,000.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.179
8,000?

13:09.179 --> 13:11.268
- I'll-I'll get a third quote.
- Yeah.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.140
- How did dinner go last night?
- I don't know.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.185
Think he's talking to
a lot of people, which is,

13:15.185 --> 13:16.665
you know, cool.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.449
- Did he call?
- Uh, no.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.712
But Dev did, and y-you're not
gonna like this,

13:20.712 --> 13:22.018
but he decided to give the piece

13:22.018 --> 13:24.455
that you wanted to sell to Inga
to his mother.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.240
Get-- Are you serious?

13:26.240 --> 13:29.199
God. You know what,
get him on the phone.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.810
I'll-I'll talk-- No.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.898
Get me the mother.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.290
Okay. And just a reminder--

13:33.290 --> 13:34.726
you have Back-to-School Night
tonight.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.119
Naomi asked me to put it
on your schedule

13:36.119 --> 13:38.034
- in case you can make it.
- Okay.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.209
Do all the parents do that

13:39.209 --> 13:41.168
or is that, like,
an optional thing?

13:42.386 --> 13:43.866
I-I don't-- I don't know, man.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.955
I'm 27.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.696
Cy's in your office.

13:47.696 --> 13:48.828
You guys had a meeting
with an accountant,

13:48.828 --> 13:50.133
like, 15 minutes ago.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.134
Yeah, yeah.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.354
Andy, you asked for it

13:53.354 --> 13:54.616
in black and white, so...

13:54.616 --> 13:58.315
Look, I can't control
the market, right?

13:58.315 --> 14:00.143
I mean, you know,

14:00.143 --> 14:02.015
nobody needs a painting.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.756
Let's rewind for a sec. So you
took a loan out from the bank

14:04.756 --> 14:05.975
to meet your obligations,

14:05.975 --> 14:08.282
but there are salaries
to pay here, Andy.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.500
Too many
for what you're bringing in.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.937
I've been telling you this
for months.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.677
Yeah,
we've been discussing that.

14:12.677 --> 14:13.940
Oh. -It's just... coming up
on the end of the year,

14:13.940 --> 14:15.115
we're not sure
it's the best time

14:15.115 --> 14:16.159
- to let people go.
- Right.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.378
Guys, come on.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.988
You're just covering costs.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.860
And then each month, the tidal
wave rolls through again.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.644
You have to borrow
from Peter to pay Paul.

14:22.644 --> 14:23.950
At some point, Peter goes broke.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.081
May I?

14:25.081 --> 14:27.562
- Please.
- Andy.

14:27.997 --> 14:32.132
I think, in fact, it may be
time to consider relocating.

14:32.132 --> 14:35.439
I know we've been here 26 years,
but the rent is killing us.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.527
Cy.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.268
Come on.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.662
There's history here, you know?

14:42.403 --> 14:43.752
28 years, by the way.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.623
Andy, look at it this way.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.190
Your artists just aren't
commanding the prices

14:47.190 --> 14:49.323
that the real estate demands.
Right?

14:49.323 --> 14:52.979
Last month, I suggested selling
inventory at a reduced rate.

14:52.979 --> 14:53.980
And we tried that, but...

14:53.980 --> 14:55.633
He's right. We tried it.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.288
I can't reduce any more.
I'll lose all my artists.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.942
- Can't do it.
- Uh-huh.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.249
Got this young guy right now.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.772
I'm telling you, there's heat--

15:03.772 --> 15:06.296
am I right, Cy?-- all around
this kid. -Yeah. -Oh.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.516
Dev's great. People love him.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.517
Really good.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.910
Has he sold yet? No.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.174
I-Is that whose work
is out there now?

15:14.174 --> 15:16.480
Yeah.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.308
Oh. Yeah.

15:18.308 --> 15:19.483
Look, here's the thing--

15:19.483 --> 15:21.529
you guys...
you guys are in debt.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.184
And at some point,
the faucet gets turned off.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.186
Look, we've been having
these meetings once a month

15:26.186 --> 15:28.971
for, what, seven months,
and there's been no improvement.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.060
In fact,
things have gotten worse.

15:31.060 --> 15:35.238
I'd say, without a new show--
and a fruitful one--

15:35.238 --> 15:38.502
you are looking at, I don't--
like, a few more months.

15:38.502 --> 15:39.677
Tops.

15:39.677 --> 15:40.896
I'm sorry.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.680
When we first moved in,
it was us,

15:42.680 --> 15:44.508
a tattoo parlor and a toy store.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.947
Now it's just, you know,
sneaker shops,

15:47.947 --> 15:50.079
and half the block
is an Apple Store.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.907
MALE VOICE [over phone]: All of
our agents are currently busy

15:51.907 --> 15:53.691
assisting other callers.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.998
Press one to have an agent
call you back. -Representative.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.914
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.263
Would you like an agent
to call you back?

16:00.263 --> 16:02.483
God, this thing is defective!

16:02.483 --> 16:04.746
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.053
Would you like an agent to
call you back? -Representative!

16:07.053 --> 16:10.056
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.
-  -

16:10.970 --> 16:13.668
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.452
Dad, I can't talk right now.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.063
I've been on the line
with the delivery service

16:17.063 --> 16:19.195
delivering my changing table
for 45 minutes.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.370
I have to call you back.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.545
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.982
Just give me a second.
Honey, hey,

16:22.982 --> 16:24.635
I really need your help
tonight, pal.

16:24.635 --> 16:25.810
I'm in a bind here.

16:25.810 --> 16:26.898
There's a thing at school.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.770
Uh, it slipped my mind.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.294
Tali can't stay, and I need
somebody to watch the kids.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.557
Could you watch the kids for me
tonight, please?

16:33.557 --> 16:35.646
Gracie, come on.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.300
- What do you say?
- No.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.215
No. I'm sorry. No.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.695
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

16:40.695 --> 16:41.826
Why not?

16:41.826 --> 16:45.004
Because I, you know,
have, like...

16:45.004 --> 16:46.788
a million things going on.

16:46.788 --> 16:50.400
I don't know. I-I have work
and I'm pregnant and...

16:50.400 --> 16:51.706
Okay.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.316
I-I don't want to.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.101
Wait. Look,

16:55.101 --> 16:57.712
I really need your help, babe.
Really, honestly.

16:57.712 --> 17:01.150
I mean, I-I never ask you
for your help, do I? I don't.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.848
I mean, I'm under
such stressful-- Oh, God.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.634
You have no idea how stressful
the circumstances are right now.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.897
Honestly. So I just need you--

17:08.897 --> 17:10.159
It'll be for a couple of hours.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.466
That's it--
couple of hours, okay?

17:12.466 --> 17:14.424
This is me begging you.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.817
I'm begging now, okay?

17:15.817 --> 17:18.472
I'm begging you,
my daughter, for help.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.560
'Kay?

17:19.560 --> 17:21.127
How often do I ever do this?

17:21.127 --> 17:22.302
Like, when do I do this?

17:22.302 --> 17:23.564
Do you really want me
to answer that?

17:23.564 --> 17:24.913
Lately. Lately.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.480
I was just gonna say "lately."

17:26.480 --> 17:27.611
I was just gonna say it.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.178
I was gonna say,
"When-when-when d--

17:29.178 --> 17:32.225
lately I asked you... honey?"

17:35.924 --> 17:38.274
How long are you pregnant for?

17:38.274 --> 17:39.580
Nine months.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.885
Ten, technically.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.496
And how much longer
until you're finished?

17:42.496 --> 17:44.411
Three and a half more months.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.674
Do you know if it's
a boy or a girl? -No.

17:46.674 --> 17:49.024
- We want to be surprised.
- Why?

17:49.024 --> 17:52.288
Pete does.
Actually, I really want to know.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.116
What do you hope it is?

17:54.116 --> 17:56.727
A girl, obviously.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.120
Sorry.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.078
I get it.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.383
Right.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.081
Are you excited to be a mom
or not really?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.604
Yes.

18:03.604 --> 18:06.172
Okay, so, uh, you guys...

18:06.172 --> 18:07.434
must be hungry.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.914
Uh, let's see,
what's your dad got here?

18:09.914 --> 18:12.091
I bet he's got, like,
pasta with butter and cheese.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.397
Why do you always say
"your dad"?

18:14.397 --> 18:16.269
Isn't he all of our dads?

18:16.269 --> 18:19.272
Well, I'm 27 years older
than you,

18:19.272 --> 18:22.013
which is basically unheard of
for siblings.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.103
Except maybe in L.A.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.279
Wait, you're 36?

18:26.279 --> 18:27.454
Is your mom good at math?

18:27.454 --> 18:28.803
'Cause you definitely
didn't inherit

18:28.803 --> 18:29.891
that skill from my father.

18:29.891 --> 18:30.979
Our father.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.982
Oh, right. Okay.

19:23.727 --> 19:24.815
Hey.

19:24.815 --> 19:25.990
Oh.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.470
Hi, Daddy. Oh.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.211
I don't-- I don't know
why I just called you that.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.691
Hey, Dad. Wha-What-What are
you doing home so early?

19:30.691 --> 19:32.388
What's up? -Uh, you know me.
I ducked out early.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.998
- Look at you. How you doing?
- Hi.

19:33.998 --> 19:36.653
- Good.
- Man, oh, man, oh, man.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.785
Get bigger every day.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.265
You look fantastic, kiddo.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.875
Really. Look so good.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.137
- Hope it's a girl.
- Dad.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.312
I do.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.705
Sorry. It'd be great.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.489
Can't believe
my baby's having a baby.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.795
- Yeah.
- You hungry?

19:47.795 --> 19:50.189
I'm starved.
Do I have any food?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.582
So, you go
to things like this now?

19:52.582 --> 19:54.671
Parent/teacher conferences?

19:54.671 --> 19:55.890
Yeah.
What are you talking about?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.761
I did all that stuff with you.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.199
- Never.
- Oh, come on.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.461
Geez, Grace, give me a break.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.376
What do you want from me?
I did my best.

20:03.376 --> 20:06.074
Do we not have
a good relationship?

20:06.466 --> 20:08.381
We do.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.992
It's just that when I was
Billie and Mose's age,

20:10.992 --> 20:12.254
I hardly saw you.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.996
There were trips to London
and Switzerland,

20:14.996 --> 20:16.650
Miami, New York.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.999
I mean...

20:17.999 --> 20:19.870
you practically lived
at the gallery.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.264
I mean, it's okay, but let's
be honest-- I was there, too.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.397
We went to New York together,
you and I, remember?

20:24.397 --> 20:26.703
Once. We went once.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.227
Yeah! Remember,
we had such a nice time?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.577
We went to see,
uh, uh, the Rockettes.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.100
I took you to Serendipity.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.494
Am I not the president
of your fan club?

20:34.494 --> 20:36.931
I am.
That piece you wrote about

20:36.931 --> 20:39.542
the death of arthouse theaters,
that was great writing.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.152
I showed it
to everybody in the office.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.329
They loved it.
Did Cy email you?

20:43.329 --> 20:45.113
Yes, yes, he did.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.375
You know what,
this conversation's

20:46.375 --> 20:47.333
really stressing me out.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.551
I got, I got work I have to do.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.074
I have to clean out
the coat closet

20:50.074 --> 20:51.598
to make room
for all the baby stuff.

20:51.598 --> 20:52.947
My back hurts like hell.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.862
And I have a human head
wedged between my ribs.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.559
So if you'll excuse me.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.866
- Ah.
- You know what?

20:58.866 --> 21:00.520
You must really love what you do

21:00.520 --> 21:02.304
to be away
from your kids to do it,

21:02.304 --> 21:04.132
because I'm already wondering,
do I really care

21:04.132 --> 21:05.829
about the dumb shit
that I write about?

21:05.829 --> 21:07.701
And I haven't even met
my kid yet.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.268
I might not even like them.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.008
What do you mean, dumb shit?
You don't write dumb shit.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.401
You're a great writer.
What are you talking about?

21:12.401 --> 21:14.403
Why? Are you thinking
about quitting?

21:14.403 --> 21:16.100
You're the senior
entertainment writer.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.754
I know my title, Dad, thank you.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.321
You know,
forget I said anything.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.498
And... you're welcome
for watching your kids.

21:22.498 --> 21:23.891
Where are you going?
Have some pi--

21:23.891 --> 21:25.284
I was just gonna say thank you.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.372
If you gave me a chance,

21:26.372 --> 21:27.721
I was just about
to say thank you.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.157
What,
does Pete want you to quit?

21:29.157 --> 21:31.290
You know,
what is your deal with Pete?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.335
Huh? He's a fantastic person.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.858
He's next-level reliable,

21:34.858 --> 21:37.252
he's sweet,
he's a brilliant doctor.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.602
He's not the type of guy
that would ever,

21:39.602 --> 21:41.691
ever ask me to quit my job.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.780
- I...
- What?

21:43.780 --> 21:45.695
- What? What?
- Nothing.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.610
I mean, I-- I mean...

21:47.610 --> 21:49.699
To be honest, he's an ear,
nose and throat doctor.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.049
- But that's okay. I mean, not--
-  Oh, my God.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.008
So an ear, nose
and throat doctor isn't

21:54.008 --> 21:56.184
a cool enough job for you,
huh, Mr. Cool Guy?

21:56.184 --> 21:57.794
No, no, no, look, I do.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.710
I like him very much, I do.
I really like him.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.582
I do.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.888
He's, he's a nerd,
and that's okay, it's...

22:04.888 --> 22:06.455
- Some people are nerds.
- Okay, you know what?

22:06.455 --> 22:08.065
No, I'm not gonna
get stressed out.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.372
It's not healthy, and I'm
already way too stressed out!

22:10.372 --> 22:12.592
Okay, okay.
Now, don't get so stressed.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.333
Just relax. We're just talking.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.465
You know what, you...

22:16.465 --> 22:19.207
you have a complex
about traditional things.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.861
It's not a direct offense to you

22:20.861 --> 22:22.863
that I don't follow
your <i>La bohème</i> school

22:22.863 --> 22:24.560
of living life in reverse.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.823
I want order.
I wanted to get married

22:26.823 --> 22:28.869
and start a family
and, I don't know!

22:28.869 --> 22:30.871
Okay, maybe, maybe
I'm just future tripping here

22:30.871 --> 22:32.916
and thinking that I don't want
to leave my baby

22:32.916 --> 22:36.267
to go write profile pieces
on some TikTokers.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.182
Okay, you're not making
any sense right now.

22:38.182 --> 22:39.706
Because first you said
you don't even know

22:39.706 --> 22:41.403
if you're gonna like the kid,
and now you're

22:41.403 --> 22:43.579
quitting your job just
to spend more time with them.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.060
- So it's-it's--
-  I'm processing.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.018
- Okay.
- This is my process.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.977
- I get it, I get it, okay.
- I'm just processing.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.979
Wait, I get it now, okay,
just don't get stressed.

22:51.979 --> 22:54.460
What do you want me to do
to help? -Just help!

22:54.460 --> 22:56.549
Dad, don't ask, just do.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.333
Okay, I'm-I'm just better

22:58.333 --> 23:00.640
when I'm told how to help.
I'm just...

23:00.640 --> 23:03.382
Oh, my God, I wish I could
record this conversation

23:03.382 --> 23:05.384
and play it back
for my therapist.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.038
See, does Pete know
how funny you are?

23:08.038 --> 23:09.779
- Yes, he does.
- Okay.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.433
- Do you want to really help?
- Yes.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.522
Okay, come shopping with me
for some baby stuff.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.958
Pete's on call all week.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.743
And-and-and the stores are
crowded on the weekends.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.701
And I just don't have
the patience to go by myself.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.921
Done. Done. Set. Play--

23:20.921 --> 23:22.923
It's, it's kind of far away.

23:22.923 --> 23:25.186
No, I want to go, I-- Honey?

23:25.186 --> 23:27.057
I love hanging out with you,
so I'm good.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.103
Let's go. I'll just go
no matter how far it is.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.018
- Any day next week.
- Okay.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.889
Tuesday, can't.

23:32.889 --> 23:36.153
And, uh, I'm not sure
about Thursday, but just...

23:36.153 --> 23:38.417
Just-just email me your
availability, okay? -Okay.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.853
- Okay, good, can't wait.
- Okay.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.637
- Love you.
- Okay, great.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.247
You've never looked better ever.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.513
-<i>Hey, Dad?</i>
-<i>Hmm?</i>

23:47.513 --> 23:51.560
Did you see our self-portraits
in the art room at school?

23:53.127 --> 23:54.476
I did.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.391
I thought they were
fantastic, really.

23:56.391 --> 23:59.960
Your use of sunlight
is, ooh, so sweet.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.701
And, Mose,
you've got this kind of

24:01.701 --> 24:03.093
Basquiat-ish vibe going,

24:03.093 --> 24:04.747
which I'm totally digging.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.575
Very abstract. Very good.
Very, very good.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.664
Hold on, I got to get this.

24:08.664 --> 24:11.188
Hey. What'd you think?

24:11.188 --> 24:14.061
Tell me that piece is not you.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.845
Huh? Really?

24:15.845 --> 24:17.891
-Dad?
- Really?

24:17.891 --> 24:19.370
Me, I think it's stunning.

24:19.370 --> 24:20.981
Dad, what's "rehab"?

24:20.981 --> 24:23.462
Gonna m--

24:24.767 --> 24:26.856
H-Hold on a minute.

24:26.856 --> 24:28.467
Yeah, ring you back.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.425
Bye. Excuse me?

24:30.425 --> 24:32.471
A girl at school said
that her mom said that

24:32.471 --> 24:35.430
that's where our mom is.
Is that true?

24:36.170 --> 24:38.781
No, it's not true.
It's absolutely not true.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.697
Who told you that? What girl?
I'm gonna call her mother.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.483
I'm just gonna Google it
if you don't tell me.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.706
Okay.

24:50.706 --> 24:52.665
Okay, look.

24:52.665 --> 24:56.495
Rehab is a place where people go
who aren't feeling well.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.410
They go there
to get to feel better.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.108
But that's not
where your mom is.

25:01.108 --> 25:03.023
Mom's in St. Louis.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.504
She told us yesterday.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.157
When did you talk
to your mother?

25:07.157 --> 25:09.072
She calls us after school.

25:09.072 --> 25:12.380
Why is that weird?

25:14.425 --> 25:17.385
It's not weird. It's not weird.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.605
It's not weird at all.
It's good.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.563
It's good.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.522
Come on, come on, shortstop.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.436
Grab your, uh,
grab your backpack.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.482
We got to get going.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.572
What are you gonna be
for Halloween this year, Mose?

25:30.572 --> 25:33.880
-The alien/car from <i>Forza.</i>
-What?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.055
That doesn't even make sense.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.884
Dad, can we go
Halloween shopping soon?

25:37.884 --> 25:40.190
Halloween?
It was just summer.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.670
- Holy mackerel.
- Come on.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.845
We're gonna be late for school.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.543
- Okay.
- Our school is

25:44.543 --> 25:45.848
- really strict about tardiness.
- Okay, okay, okay.

25:45.848 --> 25:48.895
Okay, let's go.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.027
Hi, Cy. It's Billie.
Can he call you back?

25:51.027 --> 25:52.681
We're late for school.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.378
How'd you get my phone?

25:54.378 --> 25:56.163
Hey, ask him if he saw
the article in the <i>Times.</i>

25:56.163 --> 25:58.905
- Did you see the... He saw.
- Okay.

25:58.905 --> 26:02.473
Hey, tell him to have Jonny
get a number on the daughter.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.475
Can you have Jonny get
a number on the daughter?

26:04.475 --> 26:05.781
Name?

26:05.781 --> 26:08.392
- Lola, Lola Thompson.
- Lola, Lola Thompson.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.525
All right, he'll be in
in an hour. Bye.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.788
- Okay, let's go.
- Where are our lunches?

26:12.788 --> 26:14.529
You can't get them at school?

26:14.529 --> 26:16.270
I pay all this money
for the school

26:16.270 --> 26:17.401
and they don't feed you?

26:17.401 --> 26:18.664
If you ever took us to school,

26:18.664 --> 26:20.143
you'd know that
they only give us lunches

26:20.143 --> 26:21.841
on very special days
like Taco Tuesdays.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.060
And today is not
one of those days.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.496
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, come on.

26:25.496 --> 26:26.585
Just get in the car. Let's go.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.151
We'll pick something up
on the way.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.067
Hey, come on. Hey.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.591
Sorry we're late. We're...

26:32.591 --> 26:34.462
Oh. Sorry. 'Scuse me.
All right. -Bye. -Bye. See you.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.420
Yeah, hey, hi.
We're late a little bit. -Hi.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.770
Um, these are my kids.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.815
- They're in, uh, third grade.
- Fourth grade.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.600
They're in, uh, fo--
Uh, they're in, uh...

26:41.600 --> 26:43.384
What's your teacher's name?
The one with the hair?

26:43.384 --> 26:45.734
Uh, Miss G, you mean? -Yeah,
they're in Miss G's class.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.040
Um, do you have a doctor's note?

26:47.040 --> 26:49.172
Uh, yeah, no, we're-we're just,

26:49.172 --> 26:50.609
you know,
good old-fashioned late.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.046
I'm gonna have to mark them
both as tardy then.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.396
- Dad! -
-No, no, this is my fault.

26:55.396 --> 26:56.702
This is on me.
This is my fault.

26:56.702 --> 26:57.964
I was reading a thing
in the paper.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.313
I forgot about the lunches.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.532
And, uh, next thing you know,
boom, it's 8:00.

27:01.532 --> 27:02.708
So...

27:02.708 --> 27:04.274
I'm sorry.

27:04.274 --> 27:05.754
That's not how this works.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.364
Tardy.

27:07.364 --> 27:08.583
No.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.150
It's 8:07.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.804
That's not-- That's really not
even late, seven minutes.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.632
Come on, you've never been late

27:13.632 --> 27:15.111
for a lunch
or something like that?

27:15.111 --> 27:17.200
- It's not a big deal. Just...
- Hi, hi, hi!

27:17.200 --> 27:19.942
- Sorry we're late!
- Hey! Oh, not a problem, Terry.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.770
Welcome, Alexander.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.033
- Hey, Alex.
-  Okay, come here.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.600
Come here, buddy.
Okay. Sorry, buddy.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.211
- I'm so sorry.
- What's with this guy?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.170
Alex is epileptic.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.780
He's always at the doctor.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.955
Ah.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.915
I love you so much.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.706
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

27:44.706 --> 27:46.360
- Oh, hey. Hi. How are you?
- Hey.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.796
Boy, they are strict
around here, aren't they?

27:47.796 --> 27:49.319
Yeah, they're pretty cool
with us,

27:49.319 --> 27:51.365
but they can be kind of nuts
about tardiness. -Yeah.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.367
I'm Terry, by the way.
Alexander's in class

27:53.367 --> 27:55.064
- with Billie and Mose.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.414
- I know. Yeah. Hi. Andy.
- Yeah. Yeah, I, uh,

27:57.414 --> 27:58.851
saw you briefly
at the Back-to-School Night

27:58.851 --> 28:01.027
- but didn't get a chance to...
- Yeah.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.506
Hey.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.595
If I'm out-of-bounds here,
tell me, but...

28:04.595 --> 28:07.816
uh, Billie told me about
your little guy, Alexander.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.340
Mm. -And, uh, sorry to hear.
That-That's rough, man.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.473
- Oh.
- I've got...

28:12.473 --> 28:13.735
Oh, geez. I'm sorry.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.345
No, it's okay. I'm-I'm...

28:15.345 --> 28:16.695
I'm fine.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.653
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm fine.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.568
Hold on a minute.
Hold on a minute. -I'm okay.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.657
Here. Here. -Everything sets
me off. I'm an actor, so, uh...

28:22.657 --> 28:24.398
- Oh. Yeah. It's clean.
- Oh. Thank you. That's-that's...

28:25.834 --> 28:27.444
Thank you. I'm an actor,
so all my emotions

28:27.444 --> 28:29.272
- are, like, right here.
- Oh, sure. Yeah.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.534
What kind of stuff do you do?

28:30.534 --> 28:31.971
Little bit of everything.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.190
Mostly graphic design.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.715
- Yeah. You know. Yeah.
- Sure. It's hard.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.455
Yeah, I do graphic design
when I'm not shooting something,

28:38.455 --> 28:41.720
and... lately,
I'm never shooting anything.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.983
Oh, geez. Oh, man.
There I go again. -No.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.246
This is so embarrassing.
-No. No.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.464
- Look at that.
- Oh, wow.

28:47.464 --> 28:48.944
- Two of 'em, right there.
- Very good.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.468
- Once again, clean.
- Thank you.

28:51.468 --> 28:55.255
I've just-- I've been off
since my husband left us.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.692
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's... -Thank you.

28:57.692 --> 28:58.737
How long has that been?

28:58.737 --> 28:59.738
Three years.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.522
- Three? Ah.
- Yeah.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.002
And he's only seen Alex one time

29:03.002 --> 29:04.351
- since he left.
- In three years?

29:04.351 --> 29:05.874
Yeah. Can you believe that?

29:05.874 --> 29:07.746
That's-- Sorry,
I don't know the guy,

29:07.746 --> 29:09.486
but that's kind of schmucky.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.706
Yes. Thank you.

29:11.706 --> 29:12.663
It is schmucky.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.622
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It was all just

29:14.622 --> 29:16.276
"too much" for him.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.495
But Alex and I are good.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.193
We're in a total groove
with everything.

29:21.281 --> 29:22.891
We got him
on the right medication.

29:22.891 --> 29:25.633
His doctor is A-plus-plus.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.330
- Oh, good.
- But, um...

29:27.330 --> 29:29.158
Yeah, but then someone asks you
how your day's going

29:29.158 --> 29:32.292
and suddenly you're crying
at drop-off. -Yeah.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.818
Well...

29:37.210 --> 29:38.994
Uh...

29:39.386 --> 29:40.779
I'm actually...

29:40.779 --> 29:42.650
kind of in the same boat.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.347
Little bit.

29:44.347 --> 29:45.871
- Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.743
- Naomi and I are... Oh, yeah.
- Shut up.

29:48.743 --> 29:51.354
Yeah. -Ah. That's why
she missed Back-to-School Night?

29:51.354 --> 29:52.529
Well, sort of.

29:52.529 --> 29:55.837
She-She's, uh...
seeing somebody.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.056
- Oh.
- Yeah.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.753
- Professional help.
- Oh.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.407
There's a little bit
of a drug thing.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.757
- Drug issue. Ish.
- Oh.

30:02.757 --> 30:03.845
You know, she...

30:03.845 --> 30:06.456
- she was doing drugs, so...
- Coke.

30:06.456 --> 30:07.762
- No, no, no.
- Oh.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.198
No.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.330
No. Prescription pills.

30:10.330 --> 30:11.810
Oh.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.159
I'm the husband.
I don't even know about it.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.595
- Right?
- Well...

30:14.595 --> 30:16.684
No, no. I mean,
what's that say about me?

30:16.684 --> 30:17.990
I don't-- Is this too much?

30:17.990 --> 30:19.818
- 'Cause I'm... Should I...
- No. Oh, God, no.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.167
- Seriously, though.
- No, come on.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.516
I'm the guy--
I'm supposed to know--

30:22.516 --> 30:24.779
I mean, tell me, am I in denial?

30:24.779 --> 30:26.781
Am I just dumb? I don't know.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.522
Yeah, yeah. Want to sit?

30:28.522 --> 30:30.045
Let's sit. Absolutely.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.352
Maybe she just needed a break
from it all, you know?

30:32.352 --> 30:33.701
From me. You know?

30:33.701 --> 30:36.138
You should see
the rehab center, by the way.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.226
It's like the Four Seasons.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.749
Who do you think's
paying for that?

30:40.316 --> 30:42.231
-Well, she's taking
the steps towards recovery.

30:42.231 --> 30:43.493
That's... that's good, right?

30:43.493 --> 30:45.365
Families overcome these things.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.193
Yeah, I know.
But she didn't clue me in.

30:47.193 --> 30:48.890
I had no idea.
She didn't let me know

30:48.890 --> 30:51.719
what she was going through,
and now I'm the bad guy.

30:51.719 --> 30:54.635
I got to tell you something--
you're real easy to talk to.

30:54.635 --> 30:55.723
Has anybody ever told you that?

30:57.159 --> 30:58.857
Thanks. That's, um...

30:58.857 --> 31:01.207
How-how does she sound
when you talk to her?

31:01.207 --> 31:03.687
Every time I call, they won't
let me-- I can't see her.

31:03.687 --> 31:06.429
They won't let me talk to her.
I'm completely in the dark.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.301
Mm.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.651
My advice,
you know, keep trying.

31:10.651 --> 31:13.480
- Yeah.
- Keep calling.

31:14.002 --> 31:17.049
I got to go. Um...

31:17.701 --> 31:19.965
- Good luck.
- Oh. Thanks. Yeah.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.314
- Take care, Andy.
- Yeah, sure.

31:21.314 --> 31:22.924
- You got this, mama.
- Okay.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.144
- Thanks.
-  All right.

31:32.412 --> 31:35.415
I'm sorry for not being there
for you more.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.852
I'm sorry, okay?

31:37.852 --> 31:39.375
I just want to say
I hope you're getting

31:39.375 --> 31:40.550
the help you need.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.988
I'll be here for you.
And I miss you.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.904
Hello?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.949
Naomi?

31:48.558 --> 31:49.951
Hello? Naomi.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.259
Okay. Okay.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.695
I-I know it's you.

31:54.695 --> 31:55.957
Uh...

31:55.957 --> 31:57.916
The kids told me...

31:57.916 --> 32:02.355
you call 'em after school,
so I came home to talk to you.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.662
Okay.

32:06.054 --> 32:07.969
I can tell
you're not gonna say anything.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.363
That-That's okay.
I'll-I'll do all the talking.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.104
Okay?

32:12.104 --> 32:13.757
Okay. I came to see you.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.455
I'm sure... sure you know that.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.848
And I've called every day
and left messages.

32:17.848 --> 32:20.503
I don't know...
if you've gotten them or not.

32:20.503 --> 32:24.420
Actually,
pretty sure you have, but...

32:24.420 --> 32:27.162
I just wanted
to say some things, okay?

32:27.162 --> 32:28.859
I want to say...

32:28.859 --> 32:32.211
I'm sorry for not being there
for you more,

32:32.211 --> 32:35.692
for not even knowing
to be there for you more.

32:35.692 --> 32:39.348
I know things have been weird
between us recently,

32:39.348 --> 32:42.395
and things have just... been off

32:42.395 --> 32:44.049
and I... I ignored it.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.573
I've been wrapped up
in the gallery

32:46.573 --> 32:49.576
and all the stuff
that's going on there,

32:49.576 --> 32:51.708
which is only getting worse,
by the way.

32:53.449 --> 32:56.757
And I've been...
I've been in my own universe.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.585
I know I have.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.979
And I'm sorry. I apologize.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.982
I hope you're getting
the help that you need.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.680
And I'm here
whenever you're ready.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.770
I'll just be here.

33:09.770 --> 33:12.338
Okay? I'll be here for you.

33:12.338 --> 33:15.080
The kids miss you like crazy.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.256
And I miss you.

33:17.952 --> 33:20.607
Naomi.

33:21.521 --> 33:22.870
Okay, I get it. I get it.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.437
You're not...
you're not gonna--

33:24.437 --> 33:26.961
you're not gonna say anything.
That's okay.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.615
So you can...

33:28.615 --> 33:32.749
you can call back for the kids,
and, uh...

33:32.749 --> 33:34.229
I-I won't answer.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.710
I promise I won't pick up, okay?

33:36.710 --> 33:39.191
O-Okay. Okay.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.541
I love you.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.325
Okay.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.814
Okay, can you just explain
why you're not speaking with me?

33:53.814 --> 33:55.207
MOSE [laughs]: Oh, my God.

33:55.207 --> 33:56.773
Okay, okay, okay. Watch this.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.166
Hey, guys,
where are you? I'm leaving.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.776
But you need
to press that button on top.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.039
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
-I know.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.214
- Not inside. Not inside.
- I'm pressing it.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.954
Now make it go, like,
around the lamp.

34:03.954 --> 34:04.781
- Make it come down. Come on.
-Okay. Watch.

34:04.781 --> 34:06.044
Okay, okay.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.306
Let's go.
Who got you that thing anyway?

34:07.306 --> 34:09.003
You and Mom did.
Last Christmas.

34:09.003 --> 34:10.396
- Ooh.
-Billie.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.311
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, my God! -Relax.

34:12.311 --> 34:13.703
Bring it down.
Give me the remote.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.879
- We're having fun.
- I've got to go.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.794
Billie! Hand me the remote!

34:18.404 --> 34:20.275
-  You made me do that.
- Billie!

34:20.275 --> 34:22.060
What is wrong with you?
What did I just say?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.018
Do you know how valuable
that was? -It doesn't matter.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.455
We're not even allowed to touch
anything in this house anyway.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.718
Yes, you are.
You're just not allowed to fly

34:28.718 --> 34:30.590
a fucking drone in my house.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.157
You finally said it.
Your house.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.115
It's your house!

34:34.115 --> 34:36.378
I want Mom.
She likes us more than you do.

34:36.378 --> 34:39.816
Really?
Well, Mom's not here, is she?

34:49.478 --> 34:51.393
Billie, I'm sorry.

34:51.393 --> 34:55.223
I-I'm sorry I raised my voice
and I used the f-word.

34:55.223 --> 34:56.877
I was frustrated.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.183
I yelled.
I shouldn't have done it.

34:58.183 --> 35:01.099
Will you accept my apology, please?

35:03.057 --> 35:05.494
Come on, honey.
I have to leave soon.

35:07.235 --> 35:10.238
Hey, Tali, do you think
you can get the door?

35:10.238 --> 35:11.718
What does it look like
I'm doing?

35:14.721 --> 35:17.027
Bill, the food's here.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.117
- Please. Honey.
- Just go!

35:19.117 --> 35:20.596
You go out every night!

35:20.596 --> 35:22.120
I have to go to work!

35:22.120 --> 35:23.904
Somebody has to support the...

35:23.904 --> 35:26.863
generations of children
who hate me.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.431
Bill, please.

35:32.956 --> 35:35.872
Hey.
How 'bout if I stay in tonight?

35:35.872 --> 35:38.179
We can watch a movie together.

35:38.179 --> 35:40.181
How's that sound?

35:44.838 --> 35:46.666
So great.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.973
I can't believe
you guys have never seen this.

35:49.973 --> 35:52.759
Where would we have seen it?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.632
RICK [on screen]:
My letter of transit?

35:56.632 --> 35:57.981
I could use a trip.

35:57.981 --> 35:59.809
It doesn't make
any difference about our bet.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.463
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.987
And that 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

36:03.987 --> 36:05.293
Our expenses?

36:05.293 --> 36:07.339
-Mm-hmm.
-Louis,

36:07.339 --> 36:11.212
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.651
Come on. It's perfect.

36:18.088 --> 36:20.613
So, what'd you think?

36:20.613 --> 36:21.918
I mean, they didn't even
end up together.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.485
That's just, like... crazy.

36:23.485 --> 36:26.314
I-I know.
That's what makes it a,

36:26.314 --> 36:28.316
you know, really good
love story, though, you know?

36:28.316 --> 36:29.796
It's kind of, uh...

36:29.796 --> 36:31.798
what they call "bittersweet,"
you know?

36:31.798 --> 36:33.974
Hey, look...

36:33.974 --> 36:37.195
relationships aren't easy, pal.

36:37.673 --> 36:40.241
How do you deal with having
so many girls in your life?

36:41.721 --> 36:44.637
Not very well, my friend.

36:44.637 --> 36:47.074
Not very well.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.817
It's past your bedtime.
Let's go.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.428
- D-Dad?
- Yeah?

36:54.516 --> 36:57.476
Is Mom ever coming back?

36:57.476 --> 36:58.955
Of course she is.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.305
Of course she's coming back.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.655
Why would you ask me that?

37:03.090 --> 37:06.224
Just a feeling, I guess.

37:07.616 --> 37:10.315
Hey, man, your mom loves you

37:10.315 --> 37:14.101
way, way, way too much
not to come back.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.497
Um... We're doing all right,
though, right?

37:19.106 --> 37:21.021
Yeah.

37:21.021 --> 37:23.545
We're doing pretty good.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.159
All right.

37:29.159 --> 37:32.075
Help me load up, uh,
the belle of the ball.

37:32.075 --> 37:34.295
Okay.

38:22.256 --> 38:23.649
Dad, will you close that
behind you?

38:23.649 --> 38:25.825
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you. Oof.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.348
Here, let me get that.
Let me get those--

38:27.348 --> 38:28.915
Dad, I'm fine.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.918
- All right.
-  Oh.

38:31.918 --> 38:34.181
Hey, do you have any food?
Like, any hummus or anything?

38:35.400 --> 38:36.575
What? What are you--

38:36.575 --> 38:38.620
Hello?

38:38.620 --> 38:40.535
- What's up?
- Hey, it's me and Jonny,

38:40.535 --> 38:44.060
and we have some good news
and some bad news.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.235
Okay, give me the, uh...

38:45.235 --> 38:46.802
- give me the good news.
-Okay.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.108
No, give me the bad news, right?

38:48.108 --> 38:49.370
- All right, okay.
- Never mind.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.763
- Just give me the good news.
- Well, so...

38:50.763 --> 38:52.242
- Yeah. Go ahead.
- All right.

38:52.242 --> 38:53.635
- Okay. So the good...
- Hey, hold-hold on a second.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.333
- Bill, give me a second.
- Grace.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.030
- What'd I say?
- Bill.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.901
- Sorry.
- So many kids.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.642
Who can keep track? -I know.
I'll-- Hold, hold on a second.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.992
Hey. Hey. Hold on. Hold on.

39:02.992 --> 39:06.213
- Yeah. Okay, go ahead.
-Okay. Okay.

39:06.213 --> 39:09.477
Well, the good news is that
Theresa Thompson's daughter

39:09.477 --> 39:13.176
isn't meeting with anybody
and she's not taking any calls.

39:13.176 --> 39:14.700
That's good news?

39:14.700 --> 39:16.963
She's performing tonight
in Hollywood. She's a singer.

39:16.963 --> 39:19.705
We think you should go
down there and talk to her

39:19.705 --> 39:21.184
and see what you can do.

39:21.184 --> 39:22.969
Just show up? I mean--
What kind of singer is she?

39:22.969 --> 39:25.319
Uh... well, it's...

39:25.319 --> 39:27.582
looks like it's
some kind of a jazz club.

39:27.582 --> 39:28.975
Oh. Cool.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.237
Yeah, I can do that.

39:30.237 --> 39:31.281
That'd be fun.

39:31.281 --> 39:34.197
Uh...
Okay, what's the bad news?

39:36.156 --> 39:40.160
I spoke with Dev earlier,
and, uh...

39:40.160 --> 39:42.075
he's leaving us, Andy.

39:42.075 --> 39:43.859
I'm so sorry.

39:44.556 --> 39:46.993
I-I didn't expect that.

39:46.993 --> 39:48.342
What did he say, exactly?

39:48.342 --> 39:49.996
Why didn't he call me?

39:49.996 --> 39:51.824
Well, he's nervous. He's young.

39:51.824 --> 39:53.434
First shows
are always tough, Cy.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.567
We've been through this
a million times.

39:55.567 --> 39:56.698
We work hard for that kid,

39:56.698 --> 39:58.134
and then he just
leaves us like that?

39:58.134 --> 39:59.614
Did you tell him about the ad

39:59.614 --> 40:01.094
we took out in the <i>L.A. Times?</i>

40:01.094 --> 40:02.748
I told him about it.

40:02.748 --> 40:05.011
But who's he gonna blame for
the work not selling? Himself?

40:05.011 --> 40:07.883
Look, go down
to this jazz thing,

40:07.883 --> 40:09.407
talk to Lola Thompson.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.756
I know you.

40:10.756 --> 40:13.411
And I know
you can make this happen.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.809
What's wrong?

40:20.809 --> 40:22.158
Nothing.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.290
Absolutely nothing.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.118
I have to go
to this thing tonight.

40:25.118 --> 40:26.946
Jazz club.
Check out this singer.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.295
- It's for work.
- Mm-hmm.

40:28.295 --> 40:29.470
Supposed to be
a very hip little club.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.732
You want to come with me?

40:30.732 --> 40:32.995
Your place looks fantastic,
by the way.

40:32.995 --> 40:34.432
These chairs, are they new?

40:34.432 --> 40:37.260
Nope. I've had them
for about a year.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.001
- Really?
- Just, uh, you never come over.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.438
Stop it.
I come over all the time.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.743
- Yeah, okay.
- I do.

40:41.743 --> 40:42.831
What do you say? You and me,

40:42.831 --> 40:44.093
we'll go out
on the town tonight.

40:44.093 --> 40:45.225
You and me, doing the town.

40:45.225 --> 40:47.009
- Mm.
- Starts at 10:00. It'll be fun.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.098
There's supposed to be
some good sushi over there.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.884
10:00's a little rough
for me lately, Dad.

40:51.884 --> 40:53.363
- Right.
- Yeah.

40:53.363 --> 40:54.756
- Sorry. You're right.
- Yeah.

40:54.756 --> 40:56.192
Well, what are you
gonna do for dinner?

40:56.192 --> 40:57.803
- Why don't you--
- Hello, <i>mi familia.</i>

40:57.803 --> 40:59.108
Hey, Pete. So how you doing?

40:59.108 --> 41:01.459
- Hey, Andy.
- Hi, bub.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.982
Thank you so much
for taking her shopping.

41:02.982 --> 41:04.244
I'm thrilled
I didn't have to go.

41:04.244 --> 41:05.463
- Sure.
-Uh, really?

41:05.463 --> 41:06.942
Yeah. I'm just saying.

41:06.942 --> 41:08.944
You look very beautiful,
by the way. -Me?

41:08.944 --> 41:10.032
-Uh-huh.
-You're crazy.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.599
I am not.

41:11.599 --> 41:12.948
Also, I picked up
from that Greek place you like.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.254
Yeah?

41:14.254 --> 41:16.386
- And the good froyo.
- Oh!

41:16.386 --> 41:18.084
Yum.

41:18.084 --> 41:20.216
Andy, I wish I knew
you were still here.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.696
I would've gotten more kebabs.

41:21.696 --> 41:22.915
No, I'm good. I'm--

41:22.915 --> 41:24.177
I'll grab something to eat
on the way.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.440
Uh, hey. This was fun today.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.746
Wait-- No. Um...

41:27.746 --> 41:29.443
- Here, I got it.
- No, stay.

41:29.443 --> 41:31.401
Hold on.
Uh, Dad, why don't you stay?

41:31.401 --> 41:32.925
We can-- we can
figure this out. -Yeah.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.404
- There's enough food.
- Nah. Nah. I'll be good.

41:34.404 --> 41:35.928
I'm good. Really.

41:35.928 --> 41:37.320
Okay. Um...

41:37.320 --> 41:39.758
Well... have fun.

41:39.758 --> 41:42.369
Don't worry about me.
I'm good. Thanks, kiddo.

41:42.369 --> 41:45.415
- See ya.
- Later, Pete.

41:54.773 --> 41:56.035
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

41:56.035 --> 41:57.689
- Ticket booth's over there.
- Okey doke.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.473
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.479
How are you? Hey, is this
the, uh, Lola Thompson show?

42:05.479 --> 42:07.263
Uh...

42:07.263 --> 42:09.352
Wait. Are you...

42:09.352 --> 42:10.745
Lola...

42:10.745 --> 42:12.312
Is-- Are you with her, or...

42:12.312 --> 42:13.792
No, she's... Is she perform--

42:13.792 --> 42:15.141
She's supposed
to be performing. -Wait.

42:15.141 --> 42:16.621
Uh, yeah. Probably.

42:16.621 --> 42:17.970
Uh, I think.

42:17.970 --> 42:19.145
Yeah, actually, Lola Thompson,

42:19.145 --> 42:20.494
- yes, she's right there.
- There it is.

42:20.494 --> 42:21.626
Oh, good, good. Now what?

42:21.626 --> 42:23.497
- I mean, do we, uh...
- Oh, it's $20.

42:23.497 --> 42:24.846
- There you go. There you go.
- Yeah.

42:24.846 --> 42:26.805
But 25 if online.

42:26.805 --> 42:28.633
No. I... we're...

42:28.633 --> 42:30.069
Here we are, paying now.

42:30.069 --> 42:32.114
And it's
"a night of feminist works."

42:32.114 --> 42:33.681
Enjoy.

42:33.681 --> 42:34.856
Oh.

42:34.856 --> 42:37.859
Yay, women supporting women.

42:40.296 --> 42:41.863
I've had an amazing time.

42:41.863 --> 42:43.952
I feel like
our periods are gonna be

42:43.952 --> 42:45.301
all synced up after tonight.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.870
Thank you so much.
I'm out of here, guys.

42:48.870 --> 42:50.568
You guys are fantastic.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.352
Enjoy the rest of your night.
I should stop being desperate.

42:52.352 --> 42:55.573

Somebody gave me flowers.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.641
-  This is...
-Uh, excuse me. Uh, Lola?

44:03.641 --> 44:04.685
Hi.

44:04.685 --> 44:06.774
- Hey.
- Hey. Uh... First of all,

44:06.774 --> 44:08.167
that was
a really interesting show.

44:08.167 --> 44:09.559
I wasn't, you know,
ready for that.

44:09.559 --> 44:11.823
- But it was great.
- Thank you.

44:11.823 --> 44:13.781
- Andy Goodrich.
- Thank you.

44:13.781 --> 44:15.217
- Nice to meet you, Andy.
- Yeah.

44:15.217 --> 44:17.132
I was hoping we could...

44:17.132 --> 44:18.525
chat for a little bit.

44:18.525 --> 44:20.832
Well, I was on my way out, so...

44:20.832 --> 44:23.965
I own the Goodrich Gallery,
here in L.A.

44:23.965 --> 44:26.315
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

44:26.315 --> 44:30.885
I was wondering if we could
talk about your mother Theresa.

44:30.885 --> 44:33.671
Your-- your mother,
comma, Theresa,

44:33.671 --> 44:36.848
- not Mother Teresa.
- I got you. Um...

44:36.848 --> 44:38.240
I'm so sorry,

44:38.240 --> 44:39.807
but I'm not really talking
to people just yet.

44:39.807 --> 44:42.375
- Yeah.
- You know? I need...

44:42.375 --> 44:45.508
just a little while
to think things through.

44:45.508 --> 44:46.945
She just passed.

44:46.945 --> 44:49.643
Yeah, no, I get it.
Totally understand, really.

44:49.643 --> 44:51.384
I just want to tell you

44:51.384 --> 44:55.127
I am such a fan
of your mom's work,

44:55.127 --> 44:56.694
like, for decades,

44:56.694 --> 44:58.173
and she wasn't discovered till,

44:58.173 --> 44:59.784
you know,
really late in her career.

44:59.784 --> 45:01.699
Yeah, well, she was lucky.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.788
She always said,
"If you're a female artist,

45:03.788 --> 45:05.267
- you're bound..."
-"Bound to be dead

45:05.267 --> 45:08.401
before you make any money."

45:09.402 --> 45:11.056
Yeah, I know.

45:11.056 --> 45:13.058
She said that to me, too.

45:13.058 --> 45:14.799
Hmm.

45:14.799 --> 45:16.104
You know,
I remember the first time

45:16.104 --> 45:17.758
I came across
your mother's work.

45:17.758 --> 45:20.587
I immediately bought
this really nice little piece,

45:20.587 --> 45:22.589
and I really wanted
to represent her,

45:22.589 --> 45:24.939
but, you know,
she had already gone elsewhere.

45:24.939 --> 45:26.593
I'm telling you,
here's what I think we do:

45:26.593 --> 45:28.943
we-we raise her visibility,
you know,

45:28.943 --> 45:31.641
which in turn's gonna
raise her price,

45:31.641 --> 45:33.078
but she deserves it,
I'm telling you--

45:33.078 --> 45:34.427
Sorry.

45:34.427 --> 45:36.472
My mind is going
a million miles an hour.

45:36.472 --> 45:38.779
I'm so excited
talking about this. -Okay.

45:38.779 --> 45:41.434
How do I know you're not gonna
just tag her into a show

45:41.434 --> 45:42.609
with other Black female artists?

45:42.609 --> 45:44.742
Solo presentation only. Look.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.874
I know we're only
a little boutique gallery,

45:46.874 --> 45:48.658
but that's to your advantage.

45:48.658 --> 45:50.486
You're gonna get approached
by everyone,

45:50.486 --> 45:52.097
if you haven't already.

45:52.097 --> 45:53.620
Have you already?

45:53.620 --> 45:56.754
Uh... no one else was
the only man at my show tonight.

45:56.754 --> 46:00.496
I go to every feminist works
night I can get to.

46:00.496 --> 46:01.846
Okay.

46:01.846 --> 46:04.022
Last thing
before I cut you loose.

46:04.022 --> 46:05.545
Everywhere else,

46:05.545 --> 46:07.416
you're just gonna be one of,
you know,

46:07.416 --> 46:09.636
ten or 20 different estates.

46:09.636 --> 46:12.204
You're just gonna be
on the director's to-do list.

46:12.204 --> 46:15.468
If you come with me, you get me.

46:15.947 --> 46:18.863
Okay, this has been
the longest day,

46:18.863 --> 46:22.170
and right now my mind is just
on a hot shower, so...

46:22.170 --> 46:24.782
- I will come to your gallery.
- Cool.

46:24.782 --> 46:27.132
And we will meet more formally.

46:27.132 --> 46:28.829
That is more than
I've offered anyone.

46:28.829 --> 46:29.961
Cool.

46:29.961 --> 46:33.791
And yes, there are others.

46:35.096 --> 46:36.794
How many others? I'm joking.

46:38.534 --> 46:39.971
Okay, Halloween costumes!

46:39.971 --> 46:41.799
Let's do this.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.061
Okay, you guys know
what you want?

46:43.061 --> 46:44.149
Can we divide and conquer?

46:44.149 --> 46:45.933
-Ah!

46:45.933 --> 46:47.892
- Nice, nice.
- Wow.

46:47.892 --> 46:49.067
Anyway, what was I saying?

46:49.067 --> 46:50.285
- You're a loser.
- Yes.

46:50.285 --> 46:52.374
Eh... not my words, yours.

46:52.374 --> 46:54.246
- And you're not.
- Right.

46:54.246 --> 46:57.423
Well, I'm told
time heals all wounds, but...

46:57.423 --> 47:00.643
I'm just sitting here, waiting,
and no healing.

47:00.643 --> 47:01.775
You know?

47:01.775 --> 47:03.211
You just got
to get out there, man.

47:03.211 --> 47:05.692
Get out in the world more.
Look at you.

47:05.692 --> 47:07.912
Really nice guy,
good-looking dude,

47:07.912 --> 47:09.304
great dad.

47:09.304 --> 47:11.002
Just gotta power through
this thing, man.

47:11.002 --> 47:12.655
- Come on.
- Thanks, Andy.

47:12.655 --> 47:15.528
How about you? How's
your healing process going?

47:15.528 --> 47:16.877
Not good.

47:16.877 --> 47:19.314
Still haven't heard from Naomi.

47:19.314 --> 47:20.750
I don't know. Hate it.

47:20.750 --> 47:23.362
I was over at my daughter
and her husband's house

47:23.362 --> 47:24.972
the other day.

47:24.972 --> 47:27.235
You know, it was--
I don't know, it was odd.

47:27.235 --> 47:30.151
It made me feel like, uh...

47:31.631 --> 47:32.980
...lonely, actually.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.242
Yeah.

47:34.242 --> 47:35.591
- Yeah, lonely.
-Dad! Dad, Dad!

47:35.591 --> 47:37.376
Look at this Boba Fett costume!

47:37.376 --> 47:38.681
Cool!

47:38.681 --> 47:40.640
There's a jet pack
and arm guards

47:40.640 --> 47:42.120
and an ammunition belt!

47:42.120 --> 47:44.949
Aw. Man, this is
really, really great.

47:44.949 --> 47:46.689
You know what, bud?
It's a little pricy.

47:46.689 --> 47:48.604
I bet we could find something
even cooler than this.

47:48.604 --> 47:50.868
Oh. Okay.

47:50.868 --> 47:51.999
Ooh, I don't think so.

47:51.999 --> 47:55.089
Love it. I love it.
Good find, dude.

47:55.089 --> 47:56.743
Excellent find.
Stick it in the bag.

47:56.743 --> 47:58.310
-Yes.
- That's going with us. -Ah. No.

47:58.310 --> 47:59.572
Andy, you don't have to
do that. -No, it's on me.

47:59.572 --> 48:01.182
- No...
- Forget about it, man.

48:01.182 --> 48:02.836
- Don't worry about it.
- We'll get something else.

48:02.836 --> 48:03.750
- He'll wear it one time.
- It's so not a big deal.

48:03.750 --> 48:04.577
Don't...

48:04.577 --> 48:07.014
Thank you. That's so nice.

48:07.014 --> 48:08.581
Have you thought about

48:08.581 --> 48:11.540
telling the kids
the truth about Naomi?

48:11.540 --> 48:13.499
I mean, I'm sure
they already have a hunch.

48:13.499 --> 48:15.066
They're so intuitive, you know?

48:15.066 --> 48:18.199
They-they know so little,
but they pick up on so much.

48:18.199 --> 48:20.680
- They're funny like that.
- I-I have.

48:20.680 --> 48:24.771
It just... seems like the end
of something for them, I think.

48:24.771 --> 48:26.860
You know? I mean, they still
believe in the Tooth Fairy.

48:26.860 --> 48:28.731
They don't even like it
when their meat touches

48:28.731 --> 48:30.255
their vegetables on their plate.

48:30.255 --> 48:31.604
- Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

48:31.604 --> 48:33.475
- What do we got? What do we got?
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

48:33.475 --> 48:36.217
'Cause I got about five minutes
of this place left in me.

48:36.217 --> 48:38.306
Okay. I'm going to be
a demented zombie,

48:38.306 --> 48:40.395
and Mose is gonna be
a dead alien ghost.

48:40.395 --> 48:41.614
It's gonna be so awesome.

48:41.614 --> 48:43.181
Okay. Okay.

48:43.181 --> 48:45.052
I think I have a better idea.

48:45.052 --> 48:46.575
Trick or treat!

48:46.575 --> 48:48.969
WOMAN [laughs]:
Wow, what do we have here?

48:48.969 --> 48:54.453
A hip old man
and a beautiful young señorita.

48:54.453 --> 48:56.934
Oh, look! Boba Fett!

49:00.328 --> 49:01.764
Okay. Give it back.

49:01.764 --> 49:04.376
Okay, wait. Okay,
I'll trade you for this candy.

49:04.376 --> 49:06.856
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Let me look here.

49:06.856 --> 49:07.945
Dad, I already checked.
No nuts.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.294
- Thank you.
- Let me double-check.

49:09.294 --> 49:10.382
I'll give you this one.

49:13.559 --> 49:15.213
- Boo!
-  Oh, my God.

49:15.213 --> 49:17.998
Andy, you scared me.

49:17.998 --> 49:19.782
This house is incredible.

49:19.782 --> 49:21.219
Yeah. Thanks.

49:21.219 --> 49:22.960
- It's a nice house.
- It's so nice

49:22.960 --> 49:24.309
and cozy and chic and...

49:24.309 --> 49:26.137
- Yeah.
- ...like, perfect.

49:26.137 --> 49:27.747
How long have you lived here?

49:27.747 --> 49:30.663
Since, uh, 17? No, 18 years.

49:30.663 --> 49:32.230
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah. 18 years.

49:32.230 --> 49:33.840
Hey, you drink whiskey?

49:33.840 --> 49:36.538
Uh, you know, I'm more of
a rosé fella, but yeah, sure.

49:36.538 --> 49:38.627
- Thank you.
-  There you go.

49:38.627 --> 49:42.457
Yeah. I bought it right after
my, uh, divorce from Ann.

49:42.457 --> 49:43.719
Oh, Ann.

49:43.719 --> 49:46.157
That's your
older daughter's mom, right?

49:46.157 --> 49:47.985
- Yeah. Right.
- How long were you two married?

49:47.985 --> 49:49.812
Uh, 14 years.

49:49.812 --> 49:51.771
- Hmm.
- She's in the art world, too.

49:51.771 --> 49:55.079
Hmm. -She's, uh, the director
of the Walton Museum downtown.

49:55.079 --> 49:56.863
- Oh.
- Yeah.

49:56.863 --> 49:58.647
Museum director.
That's a big job.

49:58.647 --> 49:59.822
Yeah, it is.

49:59.822 --> 50:01.955
Actually really knows
the art world.

50:01.955 --> 50:03.913
She's pretty brilliant,
I gotta say.

50:03.913 --> 50:06.612
Which, uh, explains...

50:07.743 --> 50:09.136
...probably why
she left me, but...

50:10.659 --> 50:13.314
You know,
this is actually really good.

50:13.314 --> 50:14.663
Yeah, it should be.

50:14.663 --> 50:16.926
- 31-year-old bottle there, pal.
- What?

50:16.926 --> 50:18.711
Andy, are you nuts?

50:18.711 --> 50:19.842
Don't waste this on me.

50:19.842 --> 50:21.583
I wouldn't even know
the difference.

50:21.583 --> 50:23.542
Sure you would.
You're a man of taste, I think.

50:23.542 --> 50:27.546
And seem to be a guy who enjoys
the finer things in life.

50:27.546 --> 50:30.984
Anyway, just enjoy it.

50:30.984 --> 50:33.856
How often do I get to, you know,

50:33.856 --> 50:35.380
drink with an elf?

50:35.380 --> 50:37.469
Mm.

50:37.469 --> 50:39.949
- Okay, wow.
- Is that a good okay?

50:39.949 --> 50:41.168
Good okay? Bad okay?

50:41.168 --> 50:42.387
- Good, good...?
- Well...

50:42.387 --> 50:43.605
Fuck!

50:43.605 --> 50:45.520
Oh, fuck!

50:45.520 --> 50:48.262
Oh... Oh...

50:48.262 --> 50:50.003
Let me start by saying sorry.

50:50.003 --> 50:52.484
-  Oh, my God.
- Dude. So not a big deal.

50:52.484 --> 50:54.051
You know, I just-- I've been
out of the game so long.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.530
Sure! -And I-I thought
the roaring fire

50:55.530 --> 50:56.966
and the sexy music

50:56.966 --> 50:58.707
and the 30-year-old whiskey...
I just, I don't--

50:58.707 --> 51:00.144
I-I thought things were
getting romantic? -Right.

51:00.144 --> 51:02.320
So, I could see a guy go,
"Yeah, he's..." but...

51:02.320 --> 51:04.670
By the way, let me ask--
Do I seem gay, though?

51:04.670 --> 51:06.802
Do I? -I am
very uncomfortable right now.

51:06.802 --> 51:09.022
- No, dude. I'm telling you--
- Anyway, um...

51:09.022 --> 51:10.241
Great seeing you, man.

51:10.241 --> 51:13.113
Alex! Let's go!

51:13.113 --> 51:14.375
You know what?

51:14.375 --> 51:16.377
For the record,
I'm way too young for you.

51:16.377 --> 51:18.075
Well, that's hardly
the issue here, pal.

51:18.075 --> 51:21.121
You told me to get out there.
Meet new people.

51:21.121 --> 51:22.731
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but I didn't mean me.

51:22.731 --> 51:23.993
I wasn't talking about me.

51:23.993 --> 51:25.343
It was that 30-year-old whiskey.

51:25.343 --> 51:27.388
Shame on you for serving me
that spoiled shit!

51:27.388 --> 51:29.608
Dude, you had a little sip.
It wasn'’'t that big a deal.

51:29.608 --> 51:31.566
No, no.
I said a silent "l'chaim"

51:31.566 --> 51:32.872
and I drank the whole thing.

51:32.872 --> 51:35.353
This is so embarrassing.

51:35.353 --> 51:38.573
And I am dressed like an elf!

51:38.573 --> 51:40.967
Alex! We have got to go!

51:40.967 --> 51:42.490
Dude, you have
got to relax, man.

51:42.490 --> 51:43.839
Seriously. Look.

51:43.839 --> 51:45.189
My wife's in rehab,

51:45.189 --> 51:47.060
my business has just
gone to shit...

51:47.060 --> 51:48.496
Some dude kisses me.

51:48.496 --> 51:50.977
At this point, really,
you want to know the truth?

51:50.977 --> 51:53.545
Almost doesn't fucking faze me.

51:58.158 --> 52:00.029
Oh.

52:00.421 --> 52:02.467
Guys.

52:07.602 --> 52:10.170
Can I talk to you guys?

52:10.649 --> 52:11.824
Guys?

52:11.824 --> 52:14.392
Are you dating Alex's dad?

52:14.392 --> 52:16.045
No, I'm not.

52:16.045 --> 52:19.527
It's okay if you are--
we like him and all-- but...

52:19.527 --> 52:21.790
I'd have to tell Mom
you're dating a man.

52:21.790 --> 52:23.575
Sure.

52:23.575 --> 52:25.620
Sure. That's understandable.

52:25.620 --> 52:28.536
But no, we're just friends.

52:28.536 --> 52:32.888
But, you know, thank you
for being so open-minded.

52:34.803 --> 52:38.807
I mean, honestly, I'm not sure
if I believe anything you say.

52:38.807 --> 52:41.810
You lied to us.
You and Mom both lied.

52:42.376 --> 52:45.162
You know what?
You're right. We did.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.294
We shouldn't have.

52:47.294 --> 52:49.731
We didn't want
you guys to worry.

52:49.731 --> 52:53.213
But we should've been honest
with you guys.

52:53.213 --> 52:54.693
I'm sorry.

52:54.693 --> 52:57.870
So what's the truth?
Where is she?

52:59.088 --> 53:01.526
Okay, well...

53:02.353 --> 53:07.096
...your mom wasn't feeling
like herself, you know?

53:07.096 --> 53:11.492
So she started to do some things
to make herself feel better.

53:11.492 --> 53:15.409
Turns out those things
weren't good for her.

53:15.409 --> 53:18.586
So, she decided,
'cause she's smart,

53:18.586 --> 53:21.894
to go away to this place
where there are lots of doctors,

53:21.894 --> 53:23.678
really good doctors,

53:23.678 --> 53:26.377
to help her feel better
for real.

53:26.377 --> 53:29.118
Is that what rehab is?

53:29.684 --> 53:31.991
Yeah. Yeah, kind of.

53:31.991 --> 53:33.819
Yeah, it's kind of like
when you're,

53:33.819 --> 53:36.038
you know, when you get sick,

53:36.038 --> 53:40.434
you guys go to the doctor,
you know?

53:40.434 --> 53:42.828
Basically the same thing,
except...

53:42.828 --> 53:44.525
it's just gonna take
a little longer.

53:44.525 --> 53:45.918
Is she gonna die?

53:45.918 --> 53:48.181
No, absolutely not.

53:48.181 --> 53:49.704
She's gonna be fine.

53:49.704 --> 53:51.402
She's gonna be better
than before, even.

53:51.402 --> 53:54.927
Is that why she took
all those pills all the time?

53:54.927 --> 53:58.104
Because she wasn't
feeling like herself?

53:59.279 --> 54:02.369
Yeah. I didn't know
you knew that.

54:02.804 --> 54:06.460
Well, I live with her.
It wasn't really a secret.

54:07.113 --> 54:10.116
Yeah. I wish I was
as smart as you.

54:10.116 --> 54:12.553
When is she coming home?

54:12.553 --> 54:14.294
Well, it's gonna take
a little while, you know?

54:14.294 --> 54:15.861
She's gonna be there
for a little while,

54:15.861 --> 54:17.254
but then as soon as
she feels better,

54:17.254 --> 54:19.952
she's gonna come
right back here to us,

54:19.952 --> 54:22.084
to you guys.

54:23.216 --> 54:25.087
Promise.

54:25.653 --> 54:29.178
I know it's not the same,
but, you know...

54:30.005 --> 54:32.486
I mean, I'm not going anywhere.

54:32.486 --> 54:36.185
Okay? I'm right here
for you guys. -Mm.

54:36.664 --> 54:39.014
- Okay?
- 'Kay. -'Kay.

54:39.014 --> 54:41.147
Hey.

54:43.671 --> 54:44.977
Perfect.

54:44.977 --> 54:48.328
You want to see pictures...

54:49.286 --> 54:51.636
...of where Mom is?

54:52.419 --> 54:54.160
I don't think so.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.204
Okay.

54:55.204 --> 54:56.684
I'd like to.

54:56.684 --> 55:00.035
Okay, check it out.
Look. Come here.

55:05.432 --> 55:06.433
Pretty, right?

55:06.433 --> 55:08.740
Mm-hmm.

55:17.314 --> 55:19.664
So, third bid for the sign

55:19.664 --> 55:22.231
was more than the first
and the second.

55:22.231 --> 55:24.712
Ooh.
We can't do that right now.

55:24.712 --> 55:27.149
That's just too expensive.

55:27.149 --> 55:29.326
Maybe we'll get
one of those, uh,

55:29.326 --> 55:31.415
you know, those flags that...

55:31.415 --> 55:32.720
Forget that-- it's a dumb idea.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.243
I don't even like those flags.

55:34.243 --> 55:37.508
How about we just paint
the sign on the window?

55:37.508 --> 55:39.074
That could look cool, right?

55:39.074 --> 55:41.338
- Okay, yeah, we can do that.
- All right. Work on that.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.817
- Okay. Will do.
- Okay. Okay.

55:42.817 --> 55:45.298
Um, and, uh, these came for you.

55:45.298 --> 55:49.258
Some letters that you sent
to Journeys rehab, I...

55:50.259 --> 55:52.479
They've been returned.

56:08.713 --> 56:10.105
Worth a shot.

56:10.105 --> 56:11.846
I-I'm sorry, man.

56:11.846 --> 56:14.196
No, we're all right.
It's all right.

56:14.196 --> 56:15.763
Uh, what do you want
to talk to me about?

56:15.763 --> 56:17.156
You said you wanted
to talk about something.

56:17.156 --> 56:19.158
I did, um, but,

56:19.158 --> 56:22.030
you know, I don't think
now's a great time--

56:22.030 --> 56:23.205
No, no, no, it's a perfect time.

56:23.205 --> 56:24.685
I got stuff to do later.
What do you got?

56:24.685 --> 56:26.644
Okay, um...

56:27.819 --> 56:31.605
Andy, you know how much
I love working for you.

56:31.605 --> 56:34.042
Got another offer.

56:34.913 --> 56:38.351
Actually, my buddy is opening
a gallery in Portland

56:38.351 --> 56:39.918
and he wants me to manage it.

56:39.918 --> 56:41.093
I-I just thought with all the...

56:41.093 --> 56:43.704
all the changes going on
around here...

56:43.704 --> 56:46.881
I'm really--
I'm really sorry.

56:46.881 --> 56:49.841
Are you crazy?
You have to do that.

56:49.841 --> 56:51.408
This is a great thing
for you, man.

56:51.408 --> 56:53.453
- Yeah? Cool.
- Yeah.

56:53.453 --> 56:54.715
I command you to do it.

56:54.715 --> 56:56.064
You have to do it.
Seriously, man.

56:56.064 --> 56:57.631
That's a great gig
for you, dude.

56:57.631 --> 56:58.980
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, really.

56:58.980 --> 57:01.505
Thank you, thank you.

57:02.375 --> 57:05.987
Hey, Lola. Wow, you came.

57:07.119 --> 57:09.338
You know what I was thinking?
I'm gonna send an archivist

57:09.338 --> 57:13.255
over to your mom's studio
just to catalog everything.

57:13.255 --> 57:16.955
Give the whole... whole thing
some academic grounding.

57:16.955 --> 57:18.435
- You know?
- Hmm.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.132
You know, make it available
to students.

57:20.132 --> 57:23.265
- I like that.
- Yeah.

57:23.744 --> 57:26.007
This piece...

57:26.007 --> 57:27.444
it's really intense.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.229
- My wife painted that.
- Mm.

57:30.229 --> 57:32.361
Yeah, we're separated.

57:32.710 --> 57:34.059
I mean--

57:34.059 --> 57:36.278
I don't know why that matters.
Doesn't matter.

57:36.278 --> 57:37.889
- That doesn't matter.
-Hey.

57:37.889 --> 57:40.979
Hey. Hi. Sorry.
Um, Billie's on the phone.

57:40.979 --> 57:42.067
I told her
that you're in a meeting,

57:42.067 --> 57:44.243
but she said
that it's important.

57:44.243 --> 57:45.592
Hold on a minute.
I-I got to get this.

57:45.592 --> 57:46.941
- Yeah. Take your time.
- My daughter.

57:46.941 --> 57:48.813
30 seconds.

57:50.162 --> 57:52.947
Hey. What's up?

57:53.339 --> 57:55.515
No, you can't see that.

57:55.515 --> 57:57.865
Because it's PG-13, that's why.

57:57.865 --> 57:59.171
Hold on. Sorry.

57:59.171 --> 58:01.956
Don't even try that.
Put Tali on the phone.

58:01.956 --> 58:03.044
Yeah.

58:03.044 --> 58:04.785
I didn't say that.

58:04.785 --> 58:06.352
I never said that.

58:06.352 --> 58:07.745
Uh, 6:30.

58:07.745 --> 58:09.181
I'm in the middle of something.

58:09.181 --> 58:11.226
Turkey burgers, good idea.
Good call, I like it.

58:11.226 --> 58:14.621
Yes, yes, yes. Go. Okay. Bye.

58:14.621 --> 58:16.536
Hey. Sorry.

58:16.536 --> 58:18.103
Oh, no, it's okay.

58:18.103 --> 58:20.018
How old is your daughter?

58:20.018 --> 58:22.934
Uh, twins, actually.

58:23.325 --> 58:25.763
Uh, they're, uh, nine.

58:25.763 --> 58:27.547
- Nine?
- Yeah.

58:27.547 --> 58:28.983
Wow.

58:28.983 --> 58:31.943
Moving into double digits,
though, real soon. Yeah.

58:31.943 --> 58:34.511
- That is wonderful.
- Yeah.

58:34.511 --> 58:36.034
- Great age.
- It is a really good age.

58:36.034 --> 58:37.731
Yeah.

58:38.732 --> 58:39.951
- Hi.
-Hey.

58:39.951 --> 58:42.301
- Is he...?
- He's in a meeting.

58:47.349 --> 58:49.482
Oh, hey, look who it is.

58:49.482 --> 58:51.397
- Wow. Becca, can you...?
- Yep.

58:51.397 --> 58:54.748
-Hi, Cy.
- Hello, sweetheart.

58:54.748 --> 58:56.097
Aw, look at you.

58:56.097 --> 58:57.577
You look great.

58:57.577 --> 59:00.145
- Thank you. You, too.
- Well, thank you.

59:00.145 --> 59:02.713
Yeah. -How you feeling?
How's it going with the...?

59:02.713 --> 59:04.279
"With the...?"

59:04.279 --> 59:05.542
- Good.
- Good!

59:05.542 --> 59:06.760
Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.

59:06.760 --> 59:09.502
Oh, great.
Great, great, great.

59:10.198 --> 59:11.460
He looks busy, huh?

59:11.460 --> 59:12.984
Yeah. Yes.

59:12.984 --> 59:14.899
Yeah...

59:14.899 --> 59:16.553
I think he forgot
about our hike.

59:16.553 --> 59:18.206
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah.

59:18.206 --> 59:20.165
I don't think so, no.
Theresa Thompson's daughter

59:20.165 --> 59:21.558
just popped in unexpectedly,

59:21.558 --> 59:24.343
which I have to say
is very exciting.

59:24.343 --> 59:27.564
This estate could be
the answer to our prayers.

59:27.564 --> 59:29.566
It's been rough lately, so...

59:29.566 --> 59:31.872
- Very...
- Oh.

59:31.872 --> 59:34.353
I'm so excited about this hike
the two of you are going on.

59:34.353 --> 59:36.094
Outdoors, fresh air.

59:36.094 --> 59:39.401
I know he needs
his head cleared a little bit.

59:39.401 --> 59:41.534
- Sure.
-So sorry.

59:41.534 --> 59:43.014
I knew I had something.
Damn it.

59:43.014 --> 59:45.059
Something.

59:45.059 --> 59:46.321
Hey.

59:46.321 --> 59:49.977
Lola Thompson,
this is my very pregnant--

59:49.977 --> 59:53.590
and I think pretty mad at me--
daughter, Grace.

59:53.590 --> 59:54.939
Grace, Lola.

59:54.939 --> 59:56.854
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

59:56.854 --> 59:58.899
Uh, Dad, we can reschedule.
It's fine.

59:58.899 --> 01:00:00.466
No. No, no, no.
I'm just gonna do this,

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:01.902
- and we'll go.
- When are you due?

01:00:01.902 --> 01:00:03.774
Uh, six weeks.

01:00:03.774 --> 01:00:05.732
It is the most magical time.

01:00:05.732 --> 01:00:07.691
I'm actually pretty
uncomfortable.

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:09.257
Can I?

01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:11.172
Yeah, of course.

01:00:12.347 --> 01:00:14.393
My daughter's 17.

01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:16.395
It all goes by
in the blink of an eye.

01:00:16.395 --> 01:00:19.180
- Doesn't it?
-  Yeah.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.791
Wait a minute, you--

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:24.272
I-I'm holding a breath work
at my house tomorrow night.

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:27.362
What are you guys doing?
Would you like to come?

01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:30.104
Please come.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.368
- Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:00:33.368 --> 01:00:35.849
Yeah, I can-- I can learn
to breathe better.

01:00:41.986 --> 01:00:43.988
Cy mentioned it
like I should know.

01:00:43.988 --> 01:00:46.817
Dad, what's going on?
You're so secretive.

01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:49.428
Well, things aren't
so hot right now.

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:51.778
The gallery,
we can't pay our rent, and...

01:00:51.778 --> 01:00:53.737
Our artists aren't selling.
I don't know.

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:57.305
Hasn't been-- Hasn't been
my best year.

01:00:57.305 --> 01:00:58.872
Are you thinking
you might close?

01:00:58.872 --> 01:01:00.134
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh.

01:01:00.134 --> 01:01:01.701
I'll figure it out.
I'll figure it out.

01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.485
Yeah, no, of course.
Of course you will.

01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:04.965
Yeah.

01:01:04.965 --> 01:01:07.228
The Therea estate will be, uh...

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:08.882
That'll be big if we get that.

01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:10.710
That'll put us back on the map.

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:13.365
I don't know, it kills me.

01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:15.062
I look around the office

01:01:15.062 --> 01:01:17.978
and, man, I love
these people so much.

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:20.067
I hate seeing them out there.

01:01:20.067 --> 01:01:23.114
If they have to go
look for a job, that'll kill me.

01:01:23.114 --> 01:01:25.333
I'll tell ya.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:27.031
Man, and I had everybody
back in the day.

01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:28.772
I had such a good eye.

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.948
I don't know, maybe I lost it.
Maybe I'm out of touch.

01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:32.906
Hold on.
You didn't lose anything.

01:01:32.906 --> 01:01:35.343
And you're very in touch
for someone, mm...

01:01:35.343 --> 01:01:37.563
- you know, matur-- mature.
- My age.

01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:39.478
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:43.134
I get it. I get it.

01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:44.831
Yeah.

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:48.705
The problem is, I am not even
remotely ready to be done yet.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:51.708
I got so much more to give
and I've got great ideas

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.448
and things I want to do.

01:01:53.448 --> 01:01:55.755
You know, I'm probably
in my head too much these days.

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:57.626
- You know how you do that?
- Yeah.

01:01:57.626 --> 01:01:59.280
You get up there and... I got
a wife who won't talk to me.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.674
I got a shitty business--
Can we sit for a second?

01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:04.808
Oy.

01:02:04.808 --> 01:02:07.375
This is hard, this hiking thing.

01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:10.639
What? Don't look at--

01:02:10.639 --> 01:02:12.729
Honey. We're not there yet.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.208
I'm not looking.
There's no look.

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.775
There was a look.

01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:17.168
I'm gonna be fine. Come on.

01:02:17.168 --> 01:02:19.257
Everything's all right.

01:02:19.257 --> 01:02:21.172
- Okay?
- Here.

01:02:21.172 --> 01:02:25.698
If life isn't kicking your ass,
it's not doing its job.

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:29.963
I am so sorry I laid--
Oh, come on.

01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:32.792
I shouldn't have laid
all of this on you. I'm sorry.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:35.229
No, it's fine, honestly.

01:02:35.229 --> 01:02:36.883
Honestly, this happens
all the time.

01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:39.843
I just-- I can't control it.
It's fine. I promise.

01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:43.672
Okay. -I just, I know
how much your work means to you.

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:47.546
And I don't know what to say.
I-I-I hate this, I...

01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:49.243
I hate seeing you like this.

01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:50.984
I hate being like this.

01:02:50.984 --> 01:02:53.378
- What can I do?
- Nothing. I mean, we're fine.

01:02:53.378 --> 01:02:55.075
Don't worry about it.

01:02:55.075 --> 01:02:58.252
Just don't cry, 'cause if you
cry, then I'm gonna cry and...

01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:00.298
we're up here in nature, crying.

01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:03.692
I've never seen you cry.

01:03:03.692 --> 01:03:06.304
- Really?
- Okay, once.

01:03:06.304 --> 01:03:07.827
One time.

01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:09.133
I hated it.

01:03:09.133 --> 01:03:11.309
- Don't do it.
-  Okay.

01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:13.267
Noted.

01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:17.794
I'm gonna be fine.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.360
Maybe I should cry.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.536
Uh, well, if there was
a time to cry,

01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:24.583
- this is-- this is a good time.
- Okay.

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:26.324
Things ain't that great,
but I won't.

01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:27.673
- Not going to.
- Me, neither.

01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:29.066
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Me, too.

01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:30.937
I promise you. Look at me.

01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:32.809
We're gonna be good, right?

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.898
Don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be fine.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.116
I'm always fine.

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:39.511
Come on, let's go.
Let's go climb a...

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:41.078
hill or something.

01:03:41.078 --> 01:03:43.820
Come on. Oldie and preggers.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.430
Dad.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:47.736
Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:49.390
GRACE [grunts]:
Okay.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:52.654
What year did
the California gold rush begin?

01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:54.961
What year was it?

01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:59.052
Was it... 1848?

01:03:59.052 --> 01:04:00.837
Thank you very much.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.360
Nice! Nice!

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.449
And where was it
first discovered?

01:04:04.449 --> 01:04:05.276
That's easy.

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:06.799
-Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.845
Is it...

01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:10.498
...uh, Sutter's Mill?

01:04:10.498 --> 01:04:12.587
Mose Goodrich,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:12.587 --> 01:04:14.546
Thank you very much.
There you go.

01:04:14.546 --> 01:04:18.332
How's everybody feeling
about our dual sleepovers?

01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:20.421
- Excited.
- Very excited. -Me, too.

01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:22.336
But what are you ever
going to do without us?

01:04:22.336 --> 01:04:24.295
Me? Huge party.

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:26.471
Big, big party here.
Yeah, catered.

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:27.472
-Really?
- People, celebrities.

01:04:27.472 --> 01:04:29.039
- Dad.
- DJ.

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:31.519
- What are you really doing?
- No.

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:32.869
Billie and I have a thing.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:33.957
I'm Billie.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.872
I mean Gracie.
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.048
There, that's you.
That's yours.

01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:39.353
Let's get going.

01:04:39.353 --> 01:04:41.268
That lady at the front desk
freaks me out.

01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:42.966
She kind of scares me, really.

01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:45.533
Did you pack me
a chocolate chip cookie?

01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:47.405
- I did.
- The kind I like?

01:04:47.405 --> 01:04:49.668
Exactly. Crispy on the outside.

01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:51.800
Nice and gooey and soft
in the center.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.541
- Did I get one, too?
- Yes, you did.

01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:55.152
You got two.

01:04:55.152 --> 01:04:56.936
-Hey! I heard that.
- Hey, come on, come on.

01:04:56.936 --> 01:04:59.504
Come on, come on.

01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:16.347
Deep breathing brings you
to a higher vibration.

01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:20.220
Take it nice and slow.

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:24.485
Tune in to what's happening
inside your body.

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:29.926
Feel your stress reducing,
your anxiety melting.

01:05:31.884 --> 01:05:34.191
In the areas around your chest,

01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:36.889
your shoulders.

01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:39.239
Tune in to it.

01:05:41.154 --> 01:05:43.069
Tuned. I'm tuned right there.

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:45.463
Breathe in through your nose,

01:05:45.463 --> 01:05:47.291
out through your mouth.

01:05:48.814 --> 01:05:51.512
Let your body move organically.

01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:56.474
Now let's bring some movement,
involving your shoulders.

01:05:58.911 --> 01:06:00.739
Your arms.

01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:10.401
Now, chin to chest, and hold.

01:06:11.924 --> 01:06:13.360
Open with breath.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.799
Yeah. Come on, guys.

01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.367
Get out all of
that negative energy.

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:22.239
Really get it out of you.

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:26.330
All of that trauma,

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:29.115
it all lives in your body.
Shake it out.

01:06:29.115 --> 01:06:30.073
I'm shaking.

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:33.206
And let go.

01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.340
Now you let the light in.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.255
- Through your toes.
- Okay.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.998
Into your kneecaps,

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.087
your mind,

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:45.740
your heart.

I want you to channel a word

01:07:48.325 --> 01:07:50.762
that describes
what you feel you need most

01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:52.677
from the world right now.

01:07:52.677 --> 01:07:56.420
We're all going to shout
our words at the exact same time

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.684
- and release them.
- Help!

01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:03.122
I was... gonna count to three.

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:04.950
Sorry.

01:08:10.434 --> 01:08:12.697
How you feeling, Goodrich?

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:14.394
- Fantastic.
- Yeah?

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:17.702
I didn't-- I didn't know
that I needed this.

01:08:17.702 --> 01:08:20.748
Turns out, man,
I really needed this. -

01:08:20.748 --> 01:08:22.663
Honestly, th-thanks
for inviting us.

01:08:22.663 --> 01:08:25.797
This was really, uh,
this was something.

01:08:25.797 --> 01:08:28.278
- Yeah. That makes me so happy.
- Oh, good.

01:08:28.278 --> 01:08:29.496
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

01:08:29.496 --> 01:08:31.455
I-I've been thinking
about this a lot.

01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:32.978
Um...

01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:36.634
I like the idea of being
with a boutique gallery

01:08:36.634 --> 01:08:38.723
that really understands

01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:41.117
and gives us the attention
that we deserve.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:44.511
You know? And-and more
than that, more importantly,

01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:46.470
I'm all about family, and...

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.994
watching you tonight
with your daughter, I-I...

01:08:48.994 --> 01:08:52.302
It really spoke to me
the kind of man that you are.

01:08:52.302 --> 01:08:56.001
And, uh, I think
that's the kind of man,

01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:58.873
kind of person,
that I want out in the world

01:08:58.873 --> 01:09:00.614
representing my mom.

01:09:00.614 --> 01:09:04.052
Oh, man. Wow. That's great.

01:09:04.052 --> 01:09:07.665
Thanks. One night in Topanga,
all of a sudden I'm a hugger.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.712
This-- Oh, wow, I can't
tell you, I am thrilled.

01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:13.061
- Just thrilled.
- Yeah, I am, too.

01:09:13.061 --> 01:09:15.803
I promise you,
we're gonna do great for you.

01:09:15.803 --> 01:09:17.762
I know you will.

01:09:17.762 --> 01:09:19.459
ANDY [exhales]:
I'm breathing right.

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:20.895
I'm back in business.

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:22.680
- This-- that was fun.
-Yeah.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.116
And it's all because
of you, you know that, right?

01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:25.639
Yeah, hardly, but I'll take it.

01:09:25.639 --> 01:09:27.685
No, it was.
It was fun. Thanks, hon.

01:09:27.685 --> 01:09:29.382
Let's go do something.
Let's celebrate. Come on.

01:09:29.382 --> 01:09:31.776
Oy, it's late.
Plus, what about your kids?

01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:34.039
- Don't you have to go home?
- Eh, they're at sleepovers.

01:09:34.039 --> 01:09:35.083
Come on, what do you want to do?

01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:36.563
- You can't drink.
-  No.

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:39.000
Okay, let's go
get some ice cream.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.176
You love mint chip.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.003
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:09:42.003 --> 01:09:44.397
Okay. I know a cute
little place in Venice.

01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:46.225
If we hurry, we can get there
before it closes.

01:09:46.225 --> 01:09:47.748
Let's go.

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:52.318
Hold on a minute.
Let me just do this.

01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:54.015
Yello. Hello.

01:09:54.015 --> 01:09:55.191
Hey, hi.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:58.237
Calm down.
Do you have a temperature?

01:10:01.806 --> 01:10:03.895
Yeah.

01:10:04.548 --> 01:10:06.114
Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:07.290
I'll come there.
I'll come there.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:09.074
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:11.424
30 minutes is not a long time.

01:10:11.424 --> 01:10:14.427
Do you want to stay
on the phone with me?

01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:20.433
It's gonna be okay.
I love you, too, honey.

01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:23.175
It's Grace.

01:10:23.175 --> 01:10:24.872
I'm Grace.

01:10:24.872 --> 01:10:27.745
It's Billie. Sorry. Billie.

01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:30.617
She's not feeling well. Can...

01:10:30.617 --> 01:10:33.054
Can we have a rain check
on that ice cream cone?

01:10:33.054 --> 01:10:34.534
Yeah.

01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:36.797
Okay.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.191
Yeah.

01:10:56.817 --> 01:10:58.645
Hey, Ann.

01:10:58.645 --> 01:11:00.517
Andy. Hey.

01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:02.170
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.912
- Hey.
- Geez, I must be early.

01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:06.566
Grace didn't tell me
you were gonna be here.

01:11:06.566 --> 01:11:08.307
Well, me and the kids
baked some cookies,

01:11:08.307 --> 01:11:10.353
and we just dropped them off.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:11.354
How are you?

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.617
I'm, uh, you know...

01:11:13.617 --> 01:11:15.445
No, I-I'm sorry.

01:11:15.445 --> 01:11:16.620
Grace told me. I...

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.709
I feel for Naomi.

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:20.537
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:22.539
Thanks. Yeah.

01:11:22.539 --> 01:11:24.280
Hey, congratulations.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.065
You're big-time now.
That-that's a great gig.

01:11:27.065 --> 01:11:28.371
- Way to go.
- Yeah.

01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:30.155
- Yeah, thanks. Uh...
- Yeah.

01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:32.026
I'm crazy busy.
I travel nonstop,

01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:33.506
which I don't love
so much anymore,

01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:36.248
but I'll slow down
once the baby comes.

01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:37.205
Yeah, sure, sure.

01:11:37.205 --> 01:11:38.424
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:40.296
Anyway, how are you holding up?

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.514
You didn't answer.

01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:45.301
Uh, you know, okay,
uh, surprisingly.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.563
I'm-I'm okay.

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:48.782
You're always okay.

01:11:48.782 --> 01:11:50.567
Well...

01:11:50.567 --> 01:11:51.959
That was a compliment.

01:11:51.959 --> 01:11:53.831
Didn't feel like it,
but, you know, it's okay.

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:57.356
Wait, you got
the Theresa Thompson estate.

01:11:57.356 --> 01:11:58.705
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

01:11:58.705 --> 01:12:00.664
- That's major. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, it's good.

01:12:00.664 --> 01:12:02.100
It's good. Yeah, yeah.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.320
You know, I think
I turned you on to her.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.540
Oh, I don't think so.

01:12:08.236 --> 01:12:11.196
Why aren't you at the gallery?
It's almost 11:00.

01:12:11.196 --> 01:12:12.415
This has got to be a first.

01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:14.025
I don't know, you know,
go to the market,

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:16.375
uh, drop the kids off
at school, come here.

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:18.116
You at the market?

01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:21.467
Me at the market.
I'm a market guy now.

01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:23.382
Hey, if you're early,

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:24.905
you want to go get
a cup of coffee or something?

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:26.167
Take a walk?

01:12:26.167 --> 01:12:28.213
Come on, just say yes
before, you know,

01:12:28.213 --> 01:12:29.562
before you think of an excuse.

01:12:40.138 --> 01:12:42.706
Oh, wow. Yeah.

01:12:43.271 --> 01:12:45.448
- Oh, wow. Just so stunning.
-She still has it.

01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:47.363
Have you thought about, um...

01:12:56.415 --> 01:12:58.635
Hey, let me ask you a question.

01:12:58.635 --> 01:13:00.071
What do you think about Pete?

01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:02.943
- Oh, Pete's great.
- Really?

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:04.728
- Yeah.
- No, I-I like Pete.

01:13:04.728 --> 01:13:09.689
It's just that she's so funny
and Pete is, like, so not.

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:12.126
Uh, he's nice, you know.

01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:13.954
Yeah, but yeah, who cares?

01:13:13.954 --> 01:13:16.957
- He's gonna be a great dad.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:19.003
She's the great one.
Oh, my God, she's fantastic.

01:13:19.003 --> 01:13:20.874
You say that
like you just met her.

01:13:20.874 --> 01:13:23.355
No, I mean, we've been spending
a lot of time together.

01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:24.400
That's...

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.923
You did a great job, Ann.
Really.

01:13:25.923 --> 01:13:28.534
You were always willing to,
you know,

01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:30.580
give anything up for the family.

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.452
Thanks. I admire that. Really.

01:13:34.018 --> 01:13:36.629
You see, that's the difference
between me and you.

01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:39.415
I never saw it as
giving anything up.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.680
Ann. There you are.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.811
Oh.

01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:48.641
Um, Andy, this is Barry Klein.

01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:49.903
Nice to finally meet you.

01:13:49.903 --> 01:13:52.297
- Nice to meet you.
-Oh, that's right.

01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:55.343
We're taking Grace out to lunch,
if you want to join us.

01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:57.345
You know, I would,
but I got to go to the gallery,

01:13:57.345 --> 01:13:59.652
and then I got a--
I got a thing I got to do.

01:13:59.652 --> 01:14:00.914
But I'm gonna see you

01:14:00.914 --> 01:14:02.786
at Christmas anyway
at Gracie's, right?

01:14:02.786 --> 01:14:05.353
Actually, um, we're going
to New York for the holidays.

01:14:05.353 --> 01:14:07.530
You know, quick trip
before the baby comes.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.270
Can't beat Christmas
in the city, eh?

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.576
No, you can't.

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:12.448
It's gonna be beautiful.
It's gonna be great.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.232
Thanks. Shall we?

01:14:14.232 --> 01:14:15.407
Uh, yeah.

01:14:15.407 --> 01:14:17.801
Take care, Andy.

01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:56.100
Hey, that's pretty good, guys.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.711
Lola Thompson's here.

01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:01.671
Oh, already?

01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:03.716
Okay.

01:15:06.937 --> 01:15:09.287
Definitely not Swiss Mocha,
I can tell you that.

01:15:09.287 --> 01:15:10.593
Okay.

01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:12.333
Whites will make you crazy.
Simply White.

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:14.074
- Simply White. Okay.
- That's the color.

01:15:14.074 --> 01:15:15.336
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

01:15:15.336 --> 01:15:17.121
You're early.
That's okay, that's okay.

01:15:17.121 --> 01:15:18.775
That's a good thing.
That's a good thing.

01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:20.254
PR team's not here yet,

01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:22.518
and I have got a ton of stuff
to go over with you.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.215
First, come meet my kids.

01:15:24.215 --> 01:15:25.695
Yeah, Andy, wait. Wait.

01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:29.046
Um, I came early
'cause I need to talk to you.

01:15:29.046 --> 01:15:31.091
Okay.

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:34.617
Yeah, there's really
no easy way to say this.

01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:38.011
Um, it's not personal, okay?

01:15:38.011 --> 01:15:41.058
-  Okay.
- I want you to know that.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.060
Oh, I should just
say it, I guess.

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:47.760
Um, I gave the estate
to another gallery.

01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:50.110
One in New York.

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:51.808
They flew out here,
and they, uh,

01:15:51.808 --> 01:15:55.463
they-they lined me up
with a huge buyer already,

01:15:55.463 --> 01:15:58.249
promised me a-a show
in every city.

01:15:58.249 --> 01:15:59.946
New York, London, Paris.

01:15:59.946 --> 01:16:02.819
We... we even got accepted
to Basel.

01:16:02.819 --> 01:16:05.082
Yeah. Wait a minute.

01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:07.563
Is this a done deal?

01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:09.869
Yeah, it is.

01:16:09.869 --> 01:16:13.438
I just signed
the contracts, and...

01:16:13.438 --> 01:16:17.224
you know,
we didn't have any, so...

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:19.357
No, we didn't.

01:16:19.357 --> 01:16:21.533
We didn't have a contract
'cause all we had was,

01:16:21.533 --> 01:16:23.274
you know, your word.

01:16:23.274 --> 01:16:26.886
Andy.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.238
Let me ask you something.

01:16:31.238 --> 01:16:32.675
The whole thing about, you know,

01:16:32.675 --> 01:16:35.155
family and everything,
what was that? Was that--

01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:37.027
That was true, of course.

01:16:37.027 --> 01:16:39.464
This wasn't an easy move for me.

01:16:39.464 --> 01:16:40.944
I-I wasn't looking for this.

01:16:40.944 --> 01:16:42.510
They pursued me.

01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:44.948
The offer was just...

01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:48.299
It's a lot of money, Andy.

01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:50.867
I'm a 50-year-old single mom.

01:16:50.867 --> 01:16:52.651
- I know, I know--
-Dad, help!

01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:54.653
It's Alex!

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.232
Excuse me.

01:17:08.232 --> 01:17:10.190
Hi. I'm looking for
Alexander Koch.

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.149
He was brought in about
an hour ago. I'm his father.

01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:14.238
Okay, uh, room 702,
down the hall, to the right.

01:17:14.238 --> 01:17:15.456
Okay, thank you.

01:17:32.386 --> 01:17:33.736
Hey.

01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:35.781
I was shooting
all the way in Burbank.

01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:38.566
Here's the deal.
The seizure, mild.

01:17:38.566 --> 01:17:40.917
- It was the fall, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:42.440
Okay, okay, here's the plan.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.616
They're gonna
keep him overnight,

01:17:44.616 --> 01:17:46.705
just to make sure he doesn't
have another episode, right?

01:17:46.705 --> 01:17:48.359
- Yeah.
- And as soon as he's okay,

01:17:48.359 --> 01:17:49.752
they're just gonna send him
home in the morning,

01:17:49.752 --> 01:17:50.883
and everything will be okay.

01:17:50.883 --> 01:17:52.058
He was so great, man.

01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:54.495
He was so brave
getting his stitches.

01:17:54.495 --> 01:17:56.933
He must have been so scared.
I can't believe I wasn't there.

01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.848
Oh, come on,
don't beat yourself up.

01:17:58.848 --> 01:18:01.938
He's gonna be fine.
Honestly, don't worry about it.

01:18:01.938 --> 01:18:03.591
I'm sorry I took my eye off him.

01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:05.768
No. God, come on.

01:18:05.768 --> 01:18:07.030
Hey, you got a gig, huh?

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:09.119
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
A guest spot on a soap.

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:10.381
- That's good.
- Yeah.

01:18:10.381 --> 01:18:12.688
- How'd it go?
- Eh, all right.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.515
- All right, good.
- I finished it.

01:18:14.515 --> 01:18:16.213
You want some tea
or something? Coffee?

01:18:16.213 --> 01:18:17.693
- No. No, no, no, no.
- You sure?

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.085
No, you should go.
It's late. You should--

01:18:19.085 --> 01:18:20.260
No, no, no,
I'll stay here with you.

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.697
- No, no. Thank you. I'm fine.
- Okay.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.046
Okay, okay.

01:18:23.046 --> 01:18:24.438
All right.

01:18:24.438 --> 01:18:28.094
Hey, don't worry,
he's gonna be fine.

01:18:28.094 --> 01:18:29.226
Don't worry.

01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:31.315
You look worried. Come here.

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:34.013
- There.
- Thank you.

01:18:36.668 --> 01:18:37.713
All right. Take it easy, buddy.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:40.759
Oh, yeah, nope.
All right, sorry.

01:21:33.453 --> 01:21:34.672
- Hey.
- How you doing, man?

01:21:34.672 --> 01:21:35.978
Thanks for coming.

01:21:35.978 --> 01:21:38.023
- Wouldn't miss this.
- Thank you very much.

01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:39.590
- Onward.
- Thanks, buddy.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:41.070
- Hey, Doc.
- Hey, love you, man.

01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:42.854
Thanks, man.

01:21:42.854 --> 01:21:44.769
- Ed, you came.
- I can't believe it.

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:47.728
I just can't believe
Goodrich is closing.

01:21:49.469 --> 01:21:50.775
Hey.

01:21:50.775 --> 01:21:52.429
Well, here we are.

01:21:52.429 --> 01:21:55.258
- Yeah, here we are.
- How you feeling, boss?

01:21:55.258 --> 01:21:57.521
Like I'm having
an out-of-body experience.

01:21:57.521 --> 01:22:00.089
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:22:00.567 --> 01:22:02.004
Who invited the accountant?

01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:04.571
Jesus, look at him.

01:22:04.571 --> 01:22:06.660
Yeah, hi.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.706
Hey.

01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:11.622
I'm gonna go up
and say a few words.

01:22:11.622 --> 01:22:14.190
Yeah, okay. Listen.

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:15.931
I love you, pal.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:19.021
Love you, too, buddy.

01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:20.936
Hey.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.895
I couldn't have done this
without you, you know.

01:22:24.678 --> 01:22:26.376
I want you to know that.

01:22:31.294 --> 01:22:32.773
Hi. Hey.

01:22:32.773 --> 01:22:34.819
First off...

01:22:34.819 --> 01:22:38.954
I just want to thank everyone
for even coming tonight.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:42.653
This is, uh,
this is a special night.

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:46.526
A sad one, but, you know,
monumental for me.

01:22:46.526 --> 01:22:48.746
This is big.

01:22:48.746 --> 01:22:53.403
You know,
the Buddhists say, in the end,

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:56.449
there are really only
three things that matter:

01:22:56.449 --> 01:22:58.016
how much you've loved,

01:22:58.016 --> 01:23:00.366
how gently you've lived

01:23:00.366 --> 01:23:03.195
and how gracefully

01:23:03.195 --> 01:23:05.458
you let go of the things

01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:09.245
that really weren't
even meant for you.

01:23:10.594 --> 01:23:12.335
I haven't lived that gently.

01:23:14.685 --> 01:23:17.775
And, uh, I think you all know

01:23:17.775 --> 01:23:20.821
I have a little hard time
letting go of things.

01:23:22.867 --> 01:23:26.479
But then there's love.

01:23:26.479 --> 01:23:29.395
Yeah. Man.

01:23:29.395 --> 01:23:31.267
And the love, I mean,

01:23:31.267 --> 01:23:34.357
I feel so much love
here tonight.

01:23:35.097 --> 01:23:38.143
And I have to tell you,
I have loved this gallery,

01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:41.668
boy, with everything I've got.

01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:51.026
You know, when you see
something with your eyes,

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:53.158
like, you know,
schoolchildren, let's say,

01:23:53.158 --> 01:23:54.551
crossing the street

01:23:54.551 --> 01:23:57.945
in maybe a little bit
of falling rain

01:23:57.945 --> 01:24:00.122
or the way that morning sun,

01:24:00.122 --> 01:24:01.949
you know, comes
right through your window

01:24:01.949 --> 01:24:05.170
and hits a bowl of fruit
on your kitchen counter...

01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:10.175
Or, even better...

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.449
...that smile
on your daughter's face.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.935
You know, you...

01:24:30.935 --> 01:24:34.243
you close your eyes
and you think,

01:24:34.243 --> 01:24:36.941
"I have to remember this."

01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:43.817
Because, in that moment,

01:24:43.817 --> 01:24:46.429
that's a piece of art.

01:24:46.907 --> 01:24:49.040
That's just art.

01:24:50.824 --> 01:24:52.913
Oh, boy. Okay.

01:24:52.913 --> 01:24:55.960
Well, this has been
a long journey, folks.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.180
But it's been
the ride of my life.

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.138
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:25:22.856 --> 01:25:24.902
They all come at the end.

01:25:24.902 --> 01:25:26.208
Dad.

01:25:26.208 --> 01:25:27.774
Eh, it's true.

01:25:27.774 --> 01:25:29.950
Hey, it was so nice
to see everybody.

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:31.691
Honestly, it was great, but,

01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:35.478
really, did kind of feel like
a guest at my own funeral,

01:25:35.478 --> 01:25:36.522
you know?

01:25:36.522 --> 01:25:38.872
Well, if you ask me,

01:25:38.872 --> 01:25:41.266
I think this is actually
a really good thing.

01:25:41.266 --> 01:25:43.703
- Yeah?
- Yeah, like a whole new chapter.

01:25:43.703 --> 01:25:45.096
Yeah, maybe.

01:25:45.096 --> 01:25:47.707
Hey, I'm gonna get
to see the kids a lot more,

01:25:47.707 --> 01:25:49.927
travel a little bit.

01:25:50.449 --> 01:25:53.583
Maybe even take
some tango lessons.

01:25:54.192 --> 01:25:56.934
And you're gonna be
a grandfather.

01:25:58.414 --> 01:26:02.026
Oh, come on, Goodrich,
it's just a word.

01:26:02.679 --> 01:26:05.160
Okay, I got to--
I got to sit down.

01:26:06.204 --> 01:26:08.641
No, no,
don't worry about it, Dad.

01:26:08.641 --> 01:26:09.686
I got it.

01:26:09.686 --> 01:26:11.557
- Honey...
- No need to help me.

01:26:11.557 --> 01:26:14.865
Honey, you don't have to nail me
at every given opportunity.

01:26:14.865 --> 01:26:17.259
Nicely done, thank you.

01:26:17.259 --> 01:26:19.391
Oh.

01:26:19.391 --> 01:26:21.132
- Grandfather.
- Yeah.

01:26:21.132 --> 01:26:23.221
Grandfather's like a guy
with bushy eyebrows

01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:26.485
and a walking stick
and a tweed jacket.

01:26:26.485 --> 01:26:29.140
I feel like you're describing
the old man from <i>Up.</i>

01:26:31.664 --> 01:26:34.232
Look, I know this conversation
is gonna be held against me

01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:36.539
at some point,
so can we just kind of,

01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:39.281
you know, delete it
from the transcript

01:26:39.281 --> 01:26:42.501
and let it be known
that I am really, really

01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:44.547
excited about the baby.

01:26:44.547 --> 01:26:49.160
In fact, the word "ecstatic"
comes to mind.

01:26:50.422 --> 01:26:52.424
Here.

01:26:53.425 --> 01:26:56.211
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I am extremely pregnant.

01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.734
Ah, you're fine.

01:26:57.734 --> 01:26:59.388
You're-you're fully baked.

01:26:59.388 --> 01:27:00.998
You're good. Trust me,

01:27:00.998 --> 01:27:02.347
I've been through
enough pregnancies.

01:27:02.347 --> 01:27:04.828
I know.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.222
Drink with me.

01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:14.098
Speaking of being
an expert in this field,

01:27:14.098 --> 01:27:17.232
um, I have
my last doctor's appointment

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:18.842
before Christmas tomorrow,

01:27:18.842 --> 01:27:21.540
and it's getting
a little uncomfortable to drive.

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.977
Mom's in New York
and Pete has to work, so...

01:27:23.977 --> 01:27:26.806
- Now...
- I was wondering if you...

01:27:26.806 --> 01:27:31.550
Your old man is
very, very, very available.

01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:33.683
He would take you.

01:27:33.683 --> 01:27:35.685
Gladly.

01:27:35.685 --> 01:27:38.340
Kidding me? Can't wait.

01:27:40.646 --> 01:27:42.822
Thanks for
coming tonight, honey.

01:27:43.954 --> 01:27:45.172
I know, but still,

01:27:45.172 --> 01:27:47.262
- it was nice.
- Come on.

01:27:51.135 --> 01:27:53.529
You know,
this kind of feels like

01:27:53.529 --> 01:27:56.227
an end of an era for me, too.

01:27:57.837 --> 01:28:00.100
Hmm.

01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:03.060
Well, this midlife crisis

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:05.628
is no walk in the park,
I'll tell you that.

01:28:05.628 --> 01:28:08.761
I didn't realize you were
planning to live till 120.

01:28:08.761 --> 01:28:10.850
Please don't, okay?

01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:13.157
I don't think I can afford
the therapy bills.

01:28:13.157 --> 01:28:16.378
Ooh, that was nice. 120.

01:28:16.378 --> 01:28:18.423
Oh, my God.

01:28:21.165 --> 01:28:22.384
Hallelujah.

You're home.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.075
Yeah, I'm-- I'm done.

01:29:02.075 --> 01:29:05.122
I'm out, so...

01:29:05.122 --> 01:29:08.995
God, it's so quiet in here.
Where are the kids?

01:29:08.995 --> 01:29:12.695
They're at their friend's,
some... Alex's house.

01:29:12.695 --> 01:29:13.870
Oh.

01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:17.134
Yeah, I-I know his dad
a little bit.

01:29:17.134 --> 01:29:18.962
I can't wait to see them.

01:29:20.964 --> 01:29:23.923
Look, I'm so sorry.
I-I should've called.

01:29:23.923 --> 01:29:26.186
I just, um...

01:29:26.839 --> 01:29:28.275
I didn't...

01:29:28.275 --> 01:29:30.713
I didn't really know
if you would want to see me.

01:29:30.713 --> 01:29:32.715
No, I mean, I knew
the 90 days were up

01:29:32.715 --> 01:29:35.631
'cause I got this
little reminder on my phone...

01:29:36.719 --> 01:29:39.765
...that went off, so...

01:29:39.765 --> 01:29:41.245
of course I want to see you.

01:29:41.245 --> 01:29:42.377
Andy--

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.422
Why did you have to do it
like that?

01:29:44.422 --> 01:29:46.206
I would've helped you.

01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:48.948
I didn't know what else to do.

01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:52.735
You know, I was scared.
I was so scared.

01:29:52.735 --> 01:29:54.606
And I didn't abandon our family.

01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:56.173
I-I really hope
that you know that.

01:29:56.173 --> 01:29:57.479
I know. I know.

01:29:57.479 --> 01:29:59.176
I just did not want them
to see me like that.

01:29:59.176 --> 01:30:01.047
I know. -It's not how
I want them to think of me.

01:30:01.047 --> 01:30:02.440
I know. I know.

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.400
- I know that.
- Okay.

01:30:06.052 --> 01:30:07.576
I'm sorry, Naomi.

01:30:08.185 --> 01:30:11.231
It's, like, the simplest thing
to say, but...

01:30:11.231 --> 01:30:13.146
this is the...

01:30:13.146 --> 01:30:15.584
first time I've had
a chance to say it

01:30:15.584 --> 01:30:17.629
while actually looking at you.

01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:20.066
Thank you.

01:30:20.502 --> 01:30:22.721
Anyway, um,
I'm on the other side now.

01:30:22.721 --> 01:30:26.421
And-and I'm--
And I'm doing good.

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:29.206
You know, recovery,
it's just such a journey,

01:30:29.206 --> 01:30:31.426
but I'm-I'm starting to feel
more like myself.

01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:33.428
Great. Good, good, good.

01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:35.430
Hey, I really want to help you
this time, okay?

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:39.346
'Cause I've been doing a lot
of reading about it and, uh...

01:30:39.346 --> 01:30:42.437
I just really want
to help you, okay?

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:44.961
I love you.

01:30:49.835 --> 01:30:52.055
I've been--

01:30:52.055 --> 01:30:54.884
I've been doing, um,
a lot of thinking.

01:30:54.884 --> 01:30:59.845
I've had a lot of time to think,
and we are gonna...

01:30:59.845 --> 01:31:01.934
be better as friends.

01:31:05.677 --> 01:31:08.506
Oh. Okay.

01:31:11.509 --> 01:31:15.078
Deep down, didn't you
kind of always know that...

01:31:15.078 --> 01:31:16.340
we weren't gonna make it?

01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:18.168
Uh...

01:31:18.647 --> 01:31:21.258
Actually, I can't say
that I did, no.

01:31:22.433 --> 01:31:25.436
Didn't see that one.

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.484
We've got a lot to be
grateful for. -Yeah.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:31.660
You know, we got
two beautiful kids and...

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:33.618
you're gonna be a grandfather.

01:31:33.618 --> 01:31:35.011
Yep.

01:31:35.011 --> 01:31:37.143
Yeah, about...

01:31:37.143 --> 01:31:38.275
Oh, shit.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.154
Come on, come on, come on.

01:31:48.154 --> 01:31:49.460
GRACE [recorded]:
Hi. You've reached Grace--

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.636
Ah, geez.

01:31:51.636 --> 01:31:52.942
If you leave a message,
I'll call you back.

01:31:52.942 --> 01:31:54.117
Shit.

01:31:54.117 --> 01:31:56.511
Hi. You've reached Grace.

01:31:56.946 --> 01:31:58.513
Gracie, honey, I'm on my way.

01:31:58.513 --> 01:31:59.992
Okay? Okay, okay.

01:31:59.992 --> 01:32:01.559
Ah, fuck.

01:32:01.559 --> 01:32:03.126
GRACE [recorded]:
<i>Hi. You've reached Grace.</i>

01:32:03.126 --> 01:32:05.084
<i>If you leave a message,
I'll call you back.</i>

01:32:05.084 --> 01:32:08.174
Honey, I'm on my way, okay?
I'll be there in a few minutes.

01:32:16.008 --> 01:32:17.619
Right there is fine. Thank you.

01:32:19.272 --> 01:32:21.623
- Oh, my God.
- I'm here.

01:32:21.623 --> 01:32:23.973
You remembered
you were supposed to pick me up?

01:32:23.973 --> 01:32:25.409
No, I know, honey.
I called Pete,

01:32:25.409 --> 01:32:26.802
and he said to meet you here.

01:32:26.802 --> 01:32:29.108
I tried to reach you.

01:32:29.108 --> 01:32:31.284
What happened, huh?
Something come up with the kids?

01:32:31.284 --> 01:32:33.504
Did you forget?
What was it, Dad?

01:32:33.504 --> 01:32:36.942
Uh, well, uh, Naomi showed up.

01:32:36.942 --> 01:32:39.597
Oh. Okay, well, I'm glad
that she's up and running.

01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:40.772
Maybe now I can just go back

01:32:40.772 --> 01:32:42.687
to being someone
you call from the car.

01:32:42.687 --> 01:32:45.037
Or when you need to know what
temperature to bake a potato.

01:32:45.037 --> 01:32:47.344
- Oh, Gracie, come on.
- Are we done here?

01:32:47.344 --> 01:32:49.564
Because I'm late for a doctor's
appointment because of you.

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.653
I'm sorry. Look, the woman
just showed up at my house.

01:32:51.653 --> 01:32:52.784
What was I supposed to do?

01:32:52.784 --> 01:32:54.569
I haven't talked to her
in 90 days.

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:55.831
- I have to talk to her.
- No, I get it, I get it.

01:32:55.831 --> 01:32:57.833
- Priorities. I get it.
- No, honey, come on.

01:32:57.833 --> 01:32:59.791
Look, I'm only
a few minutes late. -

01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:01.706
I'm here now.
Let's just go upstairs.

01:33:01.706 --> 01:33:04.448
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

01:33:04.448 --> 01:33:06.189
I waited for you like an idiot.

01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:07.930
I'm so sorry. I feel awful.

01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:09.322
I hate letting you down.

01:33:09.322 --> 01:33:10.976
You hate letting me down?

01:33:10.976 --> 01:33:12.064
Yes, I do.

01:33:12.064 --> 01:33:13.936
You've let me down
my whole life.

01:33:13.936 --> 01:33:16.286
This-- This is nothing.
This is a doctor's appointment.

01:33:16.286 --> 01:33:18.636
How have I let you...?

01:33:19.115 --> 01:33:21.291
Don't answer that.
Let's go upstairs.

01:33:21.291 --> 01:33:22.814
I thought you changed.

01:33:22.814 --> 01:33:24.599
I really did.
I thought you'd grown up.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:26.731
And-and you know what?
Maybe you have.

01:33:26.731 --> 01:33:29.299
But it's all for them.
I'm not a part of that.

01:33:29.299 --> 01:33:30.648
I'm a part of the original cast.

01:33:30.648 --> 01:33:31.823
I don't get to reap the benefits

01:33:31.823 --> 01:33:34.260
of the new and improved
Andy Goodrich

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:37.263
who makes you pancakes
and shows you old movies.

01:33:37.263 --> 01:33:40.266
No, no, I got
the never available, never home,

01:33:40.266 --> 01:33:42.181
never asked you
how your day was Goodrich.

01:33:42.181 --> 01:33:43.879
Honey, this is really
not good for you right now.

01:33:43.879 --> 01:33:45.750
Oh, really?
'Cause I think it is.

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:47.839
I-I think it's really good
to get things off your chest

01:33:47.839 --> 01:33:50.799
that you've held in
for 30 years.

01:33:50.799 --> 01:33:52.801
I'm mad at you.

01:33:52.801 --> 01:33:56.761
And I have been
for as long as I can remember.

01:33:56.761 --> 01:33:59.111
Just a-a steady stream of mad

01:33:59.111 --> 01:34:01.810
with spurts of liking you
in between.

01:34:02.288 --> 01:34:04.464
Do you know how hard it is
for me to watch you

01:34:04.464 --> 01:34:06.336
be father of the year
all of a sudden?

01:34:06.336 --> 01:34:09.644
Do you know how painful
it is for me?

01:34:10.166 --> 01:34:12.385
They get a version of you
that I never had.

01:34:12.385 --> 01:34:16.215
I-I never even got to live
with you past the age of 11.

01:34:16.215 --> 01:34:20.350
I don't even remember
what you look like in pajamas.

01:34:21.351 --> 01:34:23.440
We're just friends, you and I,

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:26.486
but-but they have you,
all of you.

01:34:26.486 --> 01:34:28.445
Th-They get you,
and I never did.

01:34:28.445 --> 01:34:30.795
But do you know
who shows up for you?

01:34:30.795 --> 01:34:33.668
Do you know who's
always there for you? Me.

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:36.583
- I know.
- For better or for worse, man.

01:34:36.583 --> 01:34:38.585
Because I'm the only person
that loves you

01:34:38.585 --> 01:34:40.500
as much as you love yourself.

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.459
And another thing.

01:34:42.459 --> 01:34:44.156
D-Do you know why
I married Pete?

01:34:44.156 --> 01:34:46.637
Because he's nothing like you.

01:34:46.637 --> 01:34:49.684
And maybe that, maybe that's
why you don't like him.

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:50.946
Okay, honey, please.

01:34:50.946 --> 01:34:52.861
Do you know that every time
I-I see you,

01:34:52.861 --> 01:34:56.081
I want to run into your arms
and slap you?

01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:59.694
I mean, it's the single most
confusing thing in my life.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:04.786
Because nobody, nobody can
break my heart like--

01:35:05.917 --> 01:35:06.962
Oh, my God.

01:35:06.962 --> 01:35:08.528
What? What's going on?

01:35:09.268 --> 01:35:11.227
Oh, my God, it's happening
and I'm with you!

01:35:11.227 --> 01:35:12.315
What? What's happening?

01:35:12.315 --> 01:35:14.621
- I'm sorr-- What?
- It, Dad! It!

01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:16.580
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.060
- Okay. This is okay.
- The doctor last week told me

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:19.714
that I was on track
for full term,

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:21.367
but I'm not due
for three and a half more weeks.

01:35:21.367 --> 01:35:22.760
- Okay. Okay.
- And-and I'm not dilated.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.588
And this isn't supposed
to happen

01:35:24.588 --> 01:35:26.024
- with your first baby.
- Right.

01:35:26.024 --> 01:35:27.417
Oh, my God, Mom is
in New York and Pete--

01:35:27.417 --> 01:35:28.766
- No, we're good.
- Pete. Okay.

01:35:28.766 --> 01:35:30.246
- What do we do?
- Y-You got to call Pete.

01:35:30.246 --> 01:35:31.508
You got to call Pete
and you got to tell him

01:35:31.508 --> 01:35:32.683
he's got to grab the bag.

01:35:32.683 --> 01:35:34.119
Got it, got it.
Should we go upstairs?

01:35:34.119 --> 01:35:36.469
No, Dad, we have to go
to the hospital!

01:35:36.469 --> 01:35:37.732
Got it. Let's go. Okay.

01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:39.037
W-Will you call Pete?
Where's your car?

01:35:39.037 --> 01:35:40.256
Come on. Come on. Here. Hey.

01:35:40.256 --> 01:35:41.823
Pete. Pete, Grace is in labor.

01:35:41.823 --> 01:35:42.911
We're on our way
to the hospital.

01:35:42.911 --> 01:35:44.086
Let's go. Come on.
It's go time.

01:35:44.086 --> 01:35:44.869
Tell him to grab the bag.

01:35:44.869 --> 01:35:45.914
Hey, grab the bag, dude.

01:35:45.914 --> 01:35:47.306
And the slippers by my bedside.

01:35:47.306 --> 01:35:48.655
Okay, and grab the slippers,
her slippers,

01:35:48.655 --> 01:35:49.569
on her side of the bed.

01:35:49.569 --> 01:35:51.223
Yeah, and, uh, and my cozy robe,

01:35:51.223 --> 01:35:53.269
not the one that I blow-dry
my hair in, the other one.

01:35:53.269 --> 01:35:54.966
Grab the cozy robe,
not the other one,

01:35:54.966 --> 01:35:56.098
not the hair-drying one.
What else?

01:35:56.098 --> 01:35:57.752
- Aromatherapy spray.
- Aromatherapy.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:59.231
Don't forget
the aromatherapy spray.

01:35:59.231 --> 01:36:01.059
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
And the cord blood kit.

01:36:01.059 --> 01:36:02.626
- It's over by the front door.
- Do you want to talk to him?

01:36:03.845 --> 01:36:05.194
Okay.

01:36:05.194 --> 01:36:06.630
Okay, sweetie.

01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:07.936
- You're having a contraction.
- Squeeze my hand.

01:36:07.936 --> 01:36:09.328
Just, there you go.
Squeeze that.

01:36:09.328 --> 01:36:10.765
There you go.

01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:11.940
You're doing great.
It's almost over.

01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.332
- Worst is over.
- Dad?

01:36:13.332 --> 01:36:15.378
- Yeah?
- I'm really glad you're here.

01:36:15.378 --> 01:36:17.946
Me, too, babe.
Me, too. I'm so glad.

01:36:17.946 --> 01:36:20.122
I'm really sorr--

01:36:20.122 --> 01:36:22.951
- Squeeze this one for a while.
- I'm okay now, Dad.

01:36:22.951 --> 01:36:24.604
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm okay right now.

01:36:24.604 --> 01:36:26.563
- Okay. Come on.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:36:26.563 --> 01:36:28.130
Oh, and I'm sorry about
all the horrible things

01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:29.522
that I said to you.

01:36:29.522 --> 01:36:31.394
Please, don't even
think about that.

01:36:31.394 --> 01:36:33.048
Don't worry about that.
You're hormonal.

01:36:33.048 --> 01:36:35.311
No, no, I meant them.
I just shouldn't have said them.

01:36:35.311 --> 01:36:36.834
It was really mean of me,

01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:39.968
and I hate when I get like that,
and I'm really sorry.

01:36:39.968 --> 01:36:41.447
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

01:36:41.447 --> 01:36:43.145
-  Okay.
- Yeah.

01:36:43.145 --> 01:36:44.363
Yeah.

01:36:44.363 --> 01:36:45.800
- Hey.
- Yeah?

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.192
You're having a baby tonight.

01:36:47.192 --> 01:36:48.541
- Yeah.
- In fact,

01:36:48.541 --> 01:36:50.282
this baby might be born
on Christmas.

01:36:50.282 --> 01:36:52.937
It's the most
religious thing I've ever done.

01:36:52.937 --> 01:36:54.983
Well, Grace,
you're progressing really fast.

01:36:54.983 --> 01:36:56.593
So, if you're comfortable
with the epidural,

01:36:56.593 --> 01:36:58.073
I think we should
move ahead with it.

01:36:58.073 --> 01:36:59.944
Okay, I-I actually
was kind of hoping

01:36:59.944 --> 01:37:02.120
to go without that,
if that's okay.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.295
It could slow things down

01:37:03.295 --> 01:37:04.514
but will definitely help
with the pain.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:07.952
Yeah. Okay. She wants that.

01:37:07.952 --> 01:37:10.128
Okay, looks like I'm gonna
be here for a little while,

01:37:10.128 --> 01:37:13.828
but I'll call you as soon as
the baby's born, okay?

01:37:14.219 --> 01:37:16.047
Yes, I promise.

01:37:16.047 --> 01:37:17.832
I promise.

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:20.399
I know.
I'm glad she's home, too.

01:37:20.399 --> 01:37:23.054
Okay. Okay, love you.

01:37:23.054 --> 01:37:24.447
Okay, love you. Hey, Pete.

01:37:24.447 --> 01:37:25.274
Oh, God.

01:37:25.274 --> 01:37:26.666
- Come on, Pete.
- Hey.

01:37:26.666 --> 01:37:27.842
- Whoa. You all right?
- How is she?

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:29.234
- She's good.
- Oh, good.

01:37:29.234 --> 01:37:30.757
Come on. Come here.

01:37:30.757 --> 01:37:31.933
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:37:31.933 --> 01:37:33.456
- Hey.
- You okay?

01:37:33.456 --> 01:37:35.197
- How is she doing?
- Oh, she's doing great.

01:37:35.197 --> 01:37:37.547
I think the feeling's starting
to come back in my hand.

01:37:37.547 --> 01:37:39.070
- I'm gonna be a dad.
- You're gonna be a dad.

01:37:40.158 --> 01:37:41.464
Good luck with that, Pete.

01:37:43.858 --> 01:37:45.424
Uh-oh.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.557
Hey, Grace?
We are gonna go ahead

01:37:47.557 --> 01:37:49.080
and turn you on your side, okay?

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.908
-Wait, what? Pete!
- Wh-What-What's happening?

01:37:50.908 --> 01:37:52.170
- I don't know what's happening.
-Hello, everybody.

01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:53.128
Okay, let's see what's going on.

01:37:53.128 --> 01:37:54.520
Oh, okay, so your contractions

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:56.218
are just one on top of the other

01:37:56.218 --> 01:37:57.697
and the baby's having
a hard time

01:37:57.697 --> 01:37:59.134
normalizing its heart rate.

01:37:59.134 --> 01:38:02.050
So, let's put her on
her other side. Here we go.

01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:03.442
- So, Mom and Dad.
- GRACE and PETE: Yeah.

01:38:03.442 --> 01:38:04.748
This is the plan.

01:38:04.748 --> 01:38:06.097
I'm gonna just wait
for a couple of minutes,

01:38:06.097 --> 01:38:07.620
see if the heart rate
normalizes by itself.

01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:09.579
We want to see
the heart rate go up.

01:38:09.579 --> 01:38:12.843
And if not, I'm gonna go in and
perform an emergency C-section.

01:38:12.843 --> 01:38:14.105
Wait, what?

01:38:14.105 --> 01:38:15.585
Oh, my God.

01:38:15.585 --> 01:38:18.893
Hey, let's just
talk through this, okay?

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:20.329
- Hey.
- Yeah.

01:38:20.329 --> 01:38:21.983
- Let's just talk through this.
- Okay.

01:38:21.983 --> 01:38:24.811
Okay? The baby's gonna be
just fine, I promise.

01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:26.639
Hold my hand. Hey.

01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:28.380
We're gonna bring the baby home
to that beautiful

01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.905
gender-neutral nursery
you set up.

01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:33.168
And we're not gonna sleep
for like six months,

01:38:33.168 --> 01:38:34.691
but it won't matter.

01:38:34.691 --> 01:38:36.823
And then, before you know it,
it's gonna be

01:38:36.823 --> 01:38:38.738
the first day of school.
Can you believe that?

01:38:38.738 --> 01:38:41.524
But I'm gonna be a basket case.

01:38:41.524 --> 01:38:44.701
But you, you're gonna be solid
and put together.

01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:46.746
A total ace.

01:38:46.746 --> 01:38:48.574
And then you're gonna
break down in the car.

01:38:48.574 --> 01:38:51.186
-And we're gonna
have great family vacations.

01:38:51.186 --> 01:38:53.231
Because you make
the best itineraries.

01:38:53.231 --> 01:38:55.277
Yeah. And we're gonna
take a picture of us

01:38:55.277 --> 01:38:57.714
holding the Leaning Tower
of Pisa like that.

01:38:57.714 --> 01:39:00.108
And we're also gonna make
a ton of mistakes.

01:39:00.108 --> 01:39:01.718
But then we're gonna
have a second kid...

01:39:01.718 --> 01:39:02.980
Oh.

01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:04.677
And we're gonna make less.

01:39:06.157 --> 01:39:08.159
I think our baby's gonna be
really embarrassed by us

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:09.726
for a while in high school.

01:39:09.726 --> 01:39:11.858
Especially me. I know it.

01:39:12.337 --> 01:39:14.470
But we'll get through it.
And we're gonna have each other.

01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:16.863
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:39:16.863 --> 01:39:18.126
And then college.

01:39:18.126 --> 01:39:20.258
We're buying sheets
for an extra-long twin?

01:39:20.258 --> 01:39:22.434
How did that happen?

01:39:25.263 --> 01:39:26.873
I think our baby's
really gonna miss us

01:39:26.873 --> 01:39:28.658
when they go to college.

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:31.008
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:39:32.183 --> 01:39:33.793
And I think
we're gonna get ourselves

01:39:33.793 --> 01:39:35.882
a little apartment
on the East Coast.

01:39:35.882 --> 01:39:38.973
Have ourselves
a little renaissance.

01:39:39.408 --> 01:39:41.801
It's gonna be so great, Grace.

01:39:44.456 --> 01:39:46.154
And it's just starting.

01:39:46.154 --> 01:39:48.983
Right here, right now.

01:39:48.983 --> 01:39:50.027
Yeah.

01:39:50.027 --> 01:39:52.943
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

01:39:57.252 --> 01:39:59.950
Dad, are you crying?

01:40:00.298 --> 01:40:01.517
No.

01:40:01.517 --> 01:40:02.779
No, not at all.

01:40:02.779 --> 01:40:06.565
Okay, baby's heart rate
is coming back up.

01:40:06.565 --> 01:40:08.045
- Good job, Dad.
- Oh, wow.

01:40:08.045 --> 01:40:09.438
-Take a quick look.
-You sure?

01:40:09.438 --> 01:40:10.700
-  Yeah.
- Okay, great.

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.094
Let me take a look.

01:40:13.572 --> 01:40:16.140
Okay. I think
we're ready to push.

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:18.012
You ready, Grace?

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:19.143
- I-I--
-You got this.

01:40:19.143 --> 01:40:20.188
- I'm ready.
- Yes, you are.

01:40:20.188 --> 01:40:21.754
- Okay.
- You got it.

01:40:21.754 --> 01:40:23.234
All right,
she's ten centimeters.

01:40:23.234 --> 01:40:25.062
- Pushing. I'm gonna--
- Everyone, step out

01:40:25.062 --> 01:40:26.368
- who's not essential, please.
- I'm gonna step out of here.

01:40:26.368 --> 01:40:28.326
- Okay.
-Okay. Just relax.

01:40:28.326 --> 01:40:30.589
Hey, sweetie.

01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:32.678
Yeah, Dad?

01:40:33.462 --> 01:40:35.594
One more thing, you know,
before I go.

01:40:40.599 --> 01:40:43.820
You know you're
my soulmate, right?

01:40:45.735 --> 01:40:47.606
Just wanted to tell you.

01:40:47.606 --> 01:40:49.652
That's it.

01:40:55.875 --> 01:40:58.400
Okay, I'll...

01:40:59.009 --> 01:41:00.924
- Okay, let's do it.
-Okay.

01:41:00.924 --> 01:41:02.317
