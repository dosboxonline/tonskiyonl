G.I. Joe

00:37.087 --> 00:41.758
Crashing through the sky,
comes the fearful cry:

00:42.258 --> 00:47.429
Cobra! -Cobra!
-Cobra! -Cobra!

00:47.596 --> 00:52.600
Armies of the night,
evil taking flight!

00:52.634 --> 00:57.938
Cobra! -Cobra!
-Cobra! -Cobra!

00:58.105 --> 01:00.607
Nowhere to run,
nowhere to hide

01:00.773 --> 01:04.777
Panic spreading,
far and wide!

01:04.944 --> 01:08.280
Who can turn the tide?

01:08.446 --> 01:11.116
G.I. Joe!
-a real American hero

01:11.283 --> 01:12.450
"Yo Joe!"

01:12.617 --> 01:13.618
G.I. Joe is there!

01:13.785 --> 01:16.453
G.I. Joe!
-a real American hero

01:16.620 --> 01:19.290
G.I. Joe is there!

01:19.456 --> 01:22.125
fighting for freedom,
wherever there's trouble

01:22.291 --> 01:24.793
over land and sea and air!

01:24.961 --> 01:27.463
G.I. Joe is there!

01:34.635 --> 01:36.804
Can the world oppose

01:36.971 --> 01:39.473
The deadliest of foes?

01:39.640 --> 01:44.811
Cobra! -Cobra!
-Cobra! -Cobra!

01:44.977 --> 01:50.315
Joe will risk it all
to end the evil call of

01:50.482 --> 01:55.320
Cobra! -Cobra!
-Cobra! -Cobra!

01:55.486 --> 01:57.822
Never give up,
never say die!

01:57.988 --> 02:03.994
Walking tall with banners high,
they sound the battle cry:

02:04.160 --> 02:05.829
Yo Joe! -Yo Joe!

02:05.995 --> 02:10.833
G.I. Joe! -a real American hero
G.I. Joe is there!

02:11.000 --> 02:16.504

G.I. Joe is there!

Fighting for freedom

02:18.005 --> 02:22.008

over land and sea and air!

02:22.176 --> 02:24.678
G.I.Joe is there!

02:26.513 --> 02:28.180
G.I.Joe is the code name

freedom against Cobra.

02:35.354 --> 02:39.357
a ruthless terrorist organization
determined to rule the world.

04:48.799 --> 04:57.139
Blunderers! Fools! We possess
power greater than any on earth

04:57.973 --> 05:01.476
yet our conquests are stripped
from us on every front!

05:02.977 --> 05:06.314
Our most dangerous enemy
is not G.I. Joe

05:07.148 --> 05:10.484
but your collective incompetence!

05:10.984 --> 05:11.818
Hogwash!

05:12.319 --> 05:14.488
What do you dare say?

05:14.654 --> 05:18.324
The fault, most
imperial Serpentor,

05:18.491 --> 05:21.493
lies not within
us, but within you!

05:22.161 --> 05:26.498
Your leadership has been pompous,
pusillanimous, and pathetic!

05:26.664 --> 05:27.165
What did he say?

05:27.498 --> 05:28.299
He's gone batty!

05:28.333 --> 05:29.000
That's treason!

05:29.333 --> 05:30.501
I don't believe it!

05:30.667 --> 05:34.171
Yes, leadership is at
the very heart of this matter.

05:34.504 --> 05:37.674
But it is not mine that
is inadequate, Cobra Commander,

05:37.841 --> 05:43.011
it is yours. Your ego-driven
stupidity had converted

05:43.045 --> 05:46.181
victory to catastrophe
for the last time!

05:46.848 --> 05:50.418
Go ahead. Make me the scapegoat.

05:50.518 --> 05:54.688
My loyal subordinates could
testify to my superb stewardship

05:54.855 --> 05:59.192
of Cobra ,but you don't have
the courage to let them speak.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.694
Wrong again!
Defend him, if you can.

06:03.028 --> 06:07.866
Indeed they shall.
You first, noble Destro.

06:09.033 --> 06:12.703
Militarily speaking,
it is only fair to say that

06:12.736 --> 06:16.539
Cobra Commander is
a world class... buffoon.

06:16.873 --> 06:18.542
What? Baroness!

06:18.708 --> 06:21.711
Doctor Mindbender!
Brave Xamot and Tomax!

06:22.211 --> 06:24.713
You won't let this
treacherous assassination

06:24.746 --> 06:26.882
of my character go
unchallenged, will you?

06:27.048 --> 06:30.552
Certainly not.
Destro forgot to mention

06:30.584 --> 06:33.554
your frequent displays of cowardice.

06:33.721 --> 06:34.555
ash! Hogw!

07:10.085 --> 07:12.587
And you botched
our desert campaign!

07:12.754 --> 07:15.923
We had won,
but you countermanded my order!

07:16.090 --> 07:20.093
Your meddling brought us defeat,
again and again and again!

07:20.260 --> 07:23.095
You're not just a fool
you're Cobra's curse!

07:23.263 --> 07:25.932
Inept! Insufficient! Inexcusable!

07:26.098 --> 07:34.606
Unsubstantiated fantasy!
Lies! Lies! LIES!

07:53.288 --> 07:56.957
Intruder alert, sector 45A.
Battle stations!

08:33.155 --> 08:34.322
There! Stop him!

08:43.831 --> 08:45.498
Look! Security has been breached!

08:45.666 --> 08:47.667
This may be an
assassination attempt.

08:47.834 --> 08:51.504
Serpentor must stay here.
We will intercept the intruder.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.172
I will meet this intruder at arms!

08:55.006 --> 08:57.009
No! We must protect you!

08:57.342 --> 08:59.177
Without you, there is no Cobra!

08:59.677 --> 09:04.014
Yes. Yes, if something
happened to Serpentor,

09:04.047 --> 09:05.515
it would be tragic, wouldn't it?

09:05.849 --> 09:11.353
We shall stop this assassin.
Come, follow me. Cobra!

09:17.359 --> 09:19.694
come on men lets move on

09:53.556 --> 09:56.225
No, not this way, that way!

10:06.400 --> 10:10.070
Intruder approaching Serpentor's
war room. Seal all sectors!

10:52.773 --> 10:54.941
None may challenge Serpentor.

10:57.443 --> 10:59.111
This I command!

10:59.444 --> 11:02.447
That won't be necessary.

11:06.117 --> 11:07.618
I, I have seen...

11:11.622 --> 11:17.460
I have seen you before,
in a dream, a vision.

11:17.794 --> 11:23.465
In a memory, O great Serpentor.
I am part of your destiny.

11:24.132 --> 11:28.803
When you were created,
my face was etched into your soul.

11:29.470 --> 11:35.308
I am Pythona, and now it is
time to fulfill your destiny.

11:36.142 --> 11:40.480
Behold,
the Broadcast Energy Transmitter.

11:57.494 --> 11:59.662
So I say to the guy,
"I don't care if I have to

11:59.696 --> 12:01.831
drive all night, we're
gonna be there by morning!"

12:03.165 --> 12:04.165
That's funny!

12:09.504 --> 12:13.174
Catchy tune, isn't it guys?
One more time!

12:13.507 --> 12:15.175
He can't hear you, Mainframe.

12:15.508 --> 12:18.678
Well, Dial-Tone, they're gonna
here about the Broadcast Energy

12:18.711 --> 12:23.349
Transmitter all over the world. Pure
energy, pumped through the air.

12:23.682 --> 12:26.851
Yeah, unlimited power,
anywhere, anytime we want.

12:27.352 --> 12:28.186
If it works.

12:28.853 --> 12:32.523
The B.E.T.'ll work perfectly,
Duke. I can practically feel

12:32.556 --> 12:35.525
its little semiconductors
singing under my fingertips.

12:36.026 --> 12:37.194
Hey, hey, be careful.

12:37.527 --> 12:41.030
Well, let's find out if we've
wasted a billion taxpayer dollars.

12:41.364 --> 12:43.532
Here we go. If this
thing works, it could

12:43.566 --> 12:45.367
be the key to the
world's energy crisis.

12:54.875 --> 12:55.542
It's working!

12:57.211 --> 12:58.211
All right!

13:02.382 --> 13:02.882
Hey!

13:03.882 --> 13:06.885
The B.E.T. started
Cross-Country's HAVOC!

13:07.219 --> 13:09.221
I'll shut down and see if it stops.

13:12.557 --> 13:15.393
Whoa, mule! Stop! Stop! STOP!

13:18.729 --> 13:19.897
Go, go, go! It's...

13:20.063 --> 13:22.231
Cobra!

13:22.565 --> 13:26.568
Destroy everything, except the
Broadcast Energy Transmitter!

13:27.069 --> 13:28.403
This I command!

13:56.928 --> 13:58.095
Snow Job, need a lift?

13:58.763 --> 14:00.597
Maybe walking's better
for my health!

14:01.097 --> 14:04.934
Since when are you the
nervous type? Yo Joe!

14:08.771 --> 14:09.938
They're after the B.E.T.

14:10.106 --> 14:12.274
Fall back and regroup
for counterattack.

14:21.114 --> 14:24.284
Press forward! I must
possess the Broadcast

14:24.317 --> 14:27.120
Energy Transmitter!
This I command!

14:27.787 --> 14:30.622
This operation is
costing us dearly!

14:30.789 --> 14:34.126
I hope your
contraption is worth it.

14:34.459 --> 14:39.630
That is not your concern. Do as
you're told like an obedient lackey.

14:40.130 --> 14:44.634
Lackey? You dare
call me a... Auggh!

14:46.302 --> 14:48.471
Mindbender, look out, you dolt!

14:59.981 --> 15:01.315
What the hell is that?

15:07.153 --> 15:09.489
Cover me!
The B.E.T.'s our only shot!

15:09.655 --> 15:11.490
Yo Joe!

15:15.661 --> 15:17.996
Dreadnoks, cut him down!

15:22.500 --> 15:23.834
Man with a problem, Quick Kick!

15:24.001 --> 15:25.168
What are friends for?

16:15.711 --> 16:19.214
Tomax! The B.E.T. is
activating the Joe's weapons!

16:27.221 --> 16:30.390
Treachery! We're being
attacked from behind!

16:33.059 --> 16:39.231
Stand your ground! Not
there, here! No, over there!

16:58.247 --> 17:00.248
The emperor
needs us, Commander.

17:00.582 --> 17:03.085
When I so order, Baroness.

17:09.256 --> 17:10.590
Farewell, worm!

17:28.271 --> 17:31.442
Serpentor is hurt!
We must save him! Cobr...

17:31.775 --> 17:35.945
No! retreat! Cobra, retreat!

17:36.279 --> 17:37.614
What coward called retreat?

17:38.114 --> 17:39.782
Serpentor needs us! We can't...

17:39.948 --> 17:45.120
We have a counter-attack to deal
with. Retreat to the mountains!

17:45.787 --> 17:48.122
I know where we can find sanctuary.

18:09.140 --> 18:10.641
Cobra's through
what do we do?

18:11.475 --> 18:13.644
Ah, I hate it, but we've
gotta split the force.

18:14.645 --> 18:16.813
Roadblock, form a unit
to run down Cobra.

18:17.314 --> 18:19.649
The rest of us will take care
of Serpentor and the B.E.T.

18:20.149 --> 18:23.486
You heard the man.
Let's wreck us some reptile.

18:24.153 --> 18:28.823
Yo Joe! etc.

18:35.829 --> 18:42.001
This is madness! Our men are
half frozen! You'll kill us all!

18:42.335 --> 18:47.172
Head for that pass up ahead. We'll
find sanctuary on the other side.

18:51.509 --> 18:55.513
There they are! Yeah! Yo Joe! etc.

18:57.847 --> 18:59.849
Blast! The Joes have caught up!

19:00.016 --> 19:02.852
'Ey! We didn't sign
up for nothin' fatal!

19:11.359 --> 19:13.694
Caw, mates, me eyes
are playin' tricks!

19:20.533 --> 19:22.368
'Ey, gov'nor, what's this all mean?

19:23.702 --> 19:26.705
We are safe, safe!

19:32.711 --> 19:36.714
Yo Joe!

19:42.218 --> 19:44.053
Take refuge in the grove!

19:48.557 --> 19:49.224
Knock 'em out!

19:51.893 --> 19:53.561
What is this, the Twilight Zone?

19:54.729 --> 20:00.233
Forget them redwood toadstools!
It's battle time! Yo Joe!

20:09.908 --> 20:10.409
Roadblock!

20:33.928 --> 20:35.597
Back off, fast!

20:59.783 --> 21:02.119
Gotcha now, you slippery creep!

21:27.974 --> 21:31.644
Bravo, bravo, dear friends!

21:36.482 --> 21:37.649
He knows these people?

21:38.316 --> 21:41.152
You were as impressive as ever!

21:46.323 --> 21:50.826
You struck me? Golobulus will
have your head for this!

21:51.494 --> 21:54.997
It is not his head you should be
worried about, Cobra Commander.

21:55.497 --> 21:56.331
Pythona!

21:56.832 --> 21:58.667
You will all come with me now.

21:59.334 --> 22:01.669
No! NO!

22:13.680 --> 22:16.682
Nemesis Enforcer,
fetch Cobra Commander.

22:25.856 --> 22:27.858
No! Release me!

22:28.358 --> 22:30.860
I order you to let me go!

22:37.199 --> 22:38.533
Where are you takin' the others?

22:39.200 --> 22:41.703
You will find out soon
enough, Dreadnok Ripper.

22:44.539 --> 22:45.206
You know us?

22:45.873 --> 22:49.376
We know everything.
We know that Serpentor has

22:49.543 --> 22:53.713
been captured by G. I. Joe,
and you must rescue him.

22:54.380 --> 22:56.715
Ride the Joes? Are you balmy?

22:57.382 --> 22:59.384
We don't know who
you are or where you

22:59.552 --> 23:01.386
come from or even
what side you're on.

23:02.054 --> 23:04.722
Why should we risk
our necks on your behalf?

23:06.057 --> 23:08.725
Does this answer your question?

23:10.894 --> 23:18.067
A gem of that size
answers... all my questions.

23:28.576 --> 23:32.579
Twenty-four hours, and
zip from Roadblock and his unit!

23:32.913 --> 23:35.748
They're smart and tough.
No reason to write 'em off yet.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.752
Agreed, but who's gonna take
their place if Cobra hits us now?

23:40.252 --> 23:43.088
We've got the B.E.T.
and Serpentor, General Hawk.

23:43.254 --> 23:45.424
The Fang Gang's bound
to take a whack at 'em.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.092
And we'll need all the
Joes we can get to whack back.

23:48.759 --> 23:50.761
What if I lead a search
party after Roadblock's unit?

23:51.262 --> 23:55.265
Okay. Find 'em and bring 'em back.
I'll have the B.E.T.

23:55.298 --> 23:58.101
transferred to a maximum security
station while you're away.

23:58.434 --> 23:59.936
Yo Joe!

24:02.271 --> 24:04.606
Sir, I've already ordered
Beach Head to fast-forward

24:04.640 --> 24:06.108
the training of our new recruits.

24:06.441 --> 24:08.442
The sooner they graduate,
the sooner they can fight.

24:08.776 --> 24:10.111
That's easier said than done.

24:11.279 --> 24:12.613
First they've got to
survive Beach Head.

24:13.614 --> 24:18.451
Attention! I want a stone-cold,
righteous attention!

24:19.452 --> 24:20.452
Your chin is down!

24:21.787 --> 24:22.954
Your chest out!

24:23.622 --> 24:24.623
Your gut in!

24:25.957 --> 24:27.125
Your face mean!

24:28.293 --> 24:31.629
'Cause you are rough,
tough, fightin' machines!

24:32.463 --> 24:34.131
Thank you. It's
a real pleasure to

24:34.164 --> 24:36.466
see that one o'
you's a real trooper.

24:36.633 --> 24:39.969
De nada, man.
Let's look sharp, eh, compadres?

24:40.636 --> 24:42.304
That better, sweetheart?

24:42.471 --> 24:44.473
Don't you call me sweetheart.

24:44.973 --> 24:47.475
You six Rawhides,
you're gonna learn soldierin',

24:47.509 --> 24:49.811
and... hey, there's
only five of you.

24:49.977 --> 24:52.980
Where is that gold-plated
goof-off, Lieutenant Falcon?

24:53.314 --> 24:54.148
Terrific question.

24:55.149 --> 24:56.816
Man said he had
some errands to do.

24:56.983 --> 24:59.986
Go to the tailor, wallpaper
his footlocker, weird stuff.

25:01.654 --> 25:03.155
I think he had
a date or somethin'

25:03.322 --> 25:08.826
Atten-hut! Now, I'm gonna see what
you Rawhides are really made of!

25:11.496 --> 25:14.832
You two Rawhides'll love
this little training exercise.

25:15.165 --> 25:18.001
All you gotta do is get
from here to there

25:18.168 --> 25:22.004
and ring that bell.
But watch out for surprises.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.173
Big deal. I got kicked
outta kindergartens

25:24.206 --> 25:25.508
with tougher playgrounds than this.

25:26.008 --> 25:28.343
Cut the macho, Tunnel Rat!
Now do it!

25:41.188 --> 25:42.522
All right!

25:48.861 --> 25:50.361
Big Lob makes his move!

26:01.205 --> 26:02.872
Big Lob goes for the gold!

26:06.709 --> 26:07.209
Whoa!

26:10.212 --> 26:12.380
He cuts cross-court,
sidestepping the opposition.

26:19.053 --> 26:20.721
He executes a perfect ten dive!

26:21.888 --> 26:25.058
The goal line is in sight!

26:26.726 --> 26:28.060
He breaks free near the end zone!

26:32.564 --> 26:35.566
Takes out the defense and
lays down the long bomb!

26:36.401 --> 26:38.736
It's lookin' good! Rim shot!

26:39.903 --> 26:42.072
Will it drop in? Yes!

26:50.246 --> 26:51.913
The Big Lob scores,

26:52.748 --> 26:54.916
and the crowd goes bananas!

26:56.751 --> 26:59.253
The crowd ain't the only
thing that's goin' bananas!

27:05.592 --> 27:06.593
Front and center, Law!

27:06.926 --> 27:10.596
Somewhere in this village is a time
bomb set to go off in five minutes.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.598
Find it and dispose of it.

27:12.764 --> 27:13.765
No problem, Beach Head.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.605
What's that bow-wow doin' here?

27:21.939 --> 27:23.107
This is my dog, Order.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.775
He's trained to sniff
out explosives. Order, seek.

27:25.942 --> 27:27.944
This is supposed to
be your test, Law!

27:28.277 --> 27:29.946
Eh, Law & Order is a team, man.

27:30.279 --> 27:32.114
He finds the bombs, I drive the car.

27:32.281 --> 27:33.949
We tried it the other
way, but it didn't work.

27:49.462 --> 27:50.463
C'mere, boy!

27:50.630 --> 27:52.131
But he's bringin' the bomb back!

27:52.632 --> 27:55.300
Get outta here! Gimme that!

28:07.811 --> 28:10.814
Ahh! Let go, ya dumb dog!

28:13.316 --> 28:17.485
Order, give it to me. Good fella.

28:17.819 --> 28:18.987
Get rid o' that thing!

28:21.489 --> 28:22.824
He thought you were
playing, Beach Head.

28:23.157 --> 28:24.158
He's usually quite obedient.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.994
I hope you BOTH get fleas!

28:33.165 --> 28:35.835
All right, Chuckles, the object
o' this exercise is simple.

28:36.168 --> 28:38.837
Draw a bead on that HISS
and blow it to kingdom come.

28:43.007 --> 28:46.343
Chuckles, wake up! You gotta
get it before it gets you!

28:48.012 --> 28:49.346
Hey!

28:51.681 --> 28:53.182
What are you doin'?

29:06.360 --> 29:08.862
Next time, Chuckles,
use the rocket launcher.

29:14.868 --> 29:17.370
Jinx, why aren't you
dueling Lieutenant Falcon?

29:18.537 --> 29:21.539
He didn't show. Guess he was
too chicken to take me on.

29:21.707 --> 29:24.376
Either that or he heard
you're one bad-luck lady.

29:26.377 --> 29:27.211
Who says so?

29:27.378 --> 29:30.714
Everybody. The word is when
you're around, things go wrong.

29:31.215 --> 29:33.717
Yeah, well, they usually
turn out right in the end.

29:33.884 --> 29:36.052
What in blue blazes are you doin'?

29:37.386 --> 29:39.555
Sparring. Any problem with that?

29:39.721 --> 29:41.891
Yeah. Your eyes. Keep 'em open!

29:42.057 --> 29:42.558
But I...

29:42.724 --> 29:44.225
Mouth closed, eyes open!

29:44.726 --> 29:45.393
Yes, sir!

29:45.560 --> 29:47.228
And don't call me sir!

29:59.071 --> 30:04.743
Hmph. Pathetic. Don't bother to
unpack. You ain't stayin' here long.

30:05.744 --> 30:08.413
Care to try it again, my way?

30:08.746 --> 30:11.248
As my blind ninja
master used to say,

30:13.417 --> 30:16.586
the keenest eye is
that which looks inward.

30:31.432 --> 30:32.266
See what I mean?

30:36.103 --> 30:40.106
Are you sure it's safe? Why, just
thinkin' about Serpentor

30:40.139 --> 30:44.777
bein' locked up in here gives me
goosebumps all over my body.

30:49.948 --> 30:51.115
Don't worry about it, Heather.

30:52.116 --> 30:54.118
When you're lucky enough
to have Lieutenant Falcon

30:54.285 --> 30:58.454
for a guide, you have
nothing to fear but... Falcon himself.

30:58.788 --> 31:02.124
Don't try spookin' me, Falcon
I'm scared enough as it is.

31:02.791 --> 31:04.460
C'mon. You can relax with me.

31:05.127 --> 31:06.795
Now, you see those tech
manuals over there?

31:07.463 --> 31:09.464
Now just suppose those
were Cobra creeps.

31:10.131 --> 31:10.965
Look out!

31:13.467 --> 31:15.969
Ooh, do it again Falcon, please.

31:17.137 --> 31:19.138
Watch this: over my shoulder.

31:21.975 --> 31:24.477
Duke! What are you doing here?

31:24.810 --> 31:27.479
My duty, which is more than
you seem able to do.

31:27.979 --> 31:31.483
Didn't it occur to you that a military
prison was no place for a date?

31:31.649 --> 31:33.484
I thought you said
you were in charge.

31:34.151 --> 31:36.320
A camera? You let her
bring a camera in here?

31:36.487 --> 31:37.487
I'm taking that film.

31:38.155 --> 31:38.989
I, I didn't know.

31:39.823 --> 31:42.492
Mellow out. She didn't
take any pictures.

31:42.992 --> 31:46.161
Film AND visitors are
forbidden here, Lieutenant Falcon.

31:46.495 --> 31:48.497
You're supposed to be
aware of those regulations!

31:48.997 --> 31:50.999
I'll take the lady elsewhere, SIR!

31:51.333 --> 31:54.335
C'mon, babe, this is
starting to get BORING.

31:54.669 --> 31:56.837
I'll show you boring, mister!

31:57.838 --> 32:00.841
Jinx, escort this young lady
off the base,.on the double!

32:01.341 --> 32:03.676
Right, Duke. Let's go, Goldilocks.

32:04.010 --> 32:06.345
I had a wonderful time, Falcon!

32:08.013 --> 32:12.851
That Falcon is such a hunk!
I'm talkin' major league gorgeous.

32:13.351 --> 32:17.355
But I'm not tellin' you anything
you don't already know, am I?

32:17.521 --> 32:20.357
As a matter of fact, I did have
kind of a date with Falcon,

32:20.857 --> 32:23.026
but I doubt he's gonna
have much time for

32:23.060 --> 32:25.027
socializing with either
of us from here on.

32:25.695 --> 32:27.363
Now make like an amoeba and split.

32:27.696 --> 32:28.697
Toodleoo!

32:32.534 --> 32:35.370
You're dangerously close
to insubordination, mister!

32:35.537 --> 32:37.705
And you're over the
line on military protocol!

32:38.205 --> 32:39.874
I'm an officer and I'm pullin' rank!

32:40.374 --> 32:41.208
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

32:42.376 --> 32:46.545
The only thing you're pulling is
guard duty until I say otherwise!

33:05.729 --> 33:07.063
Takin' a dip, love?

33:12.734 --> 33:15.403
Zarana! I didn't know it was you!

33:16.737 --> 33:21.742
Neatly done, sister. I trust your
mission was equally well executed?

33:22.076 --> 33:26.246
Duke took the film in my camera,
but not in my earrings.

33:28.748 --> 33:33.085
We'll soon know everything we need
to penetrate the Joes' stockade.

33:36.921 --> 33:39.924
Blimey! It's a bloomin' sea monster!

33:43.260 --> 33:45.095
Excellent, Zarana.
You have done well.

33:46.096 --> 33:51.434
We shall use your information to
free my lord Serpentor, tonight.

33:57.939 --> 34:00.275
I'm gettin' a nasty little
feelin' like a train's comin' in

34:00.308 --> 34:03.277
and I'm gonna be under it.
Know what I mean, GUNG-HO.

34:03.777 --> 34:06.947
Yeah, we're all antsy tonight,
Alpine, but don't sweat it.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.949
That new kid, Lieutenant Falcon,
is guardin' our outer perimeter.

34:11.618 --> 34:13.952
If anyone's dumb enough to try
anything, they've got to get

34:13.985 --> 34:18.289
past him first. I figure he'll
give us all the warning we need.

34:30.132 --> 34:31.967
Nice legs for a
grease monkey, soldier.

34:32.467 --> 34:33.302
Falcon!

34:34.303 --> 34:35.638
Want me to kiss it
and make it better?

34:36.638 --> 34:38.974
Consider this motor
pool enemy territory.

34:39.308 --> 34:41.143
You're supposed to
be happy to see me, Jinx.

34:41.309 --> 34:43.645
And you're supposed
to be on guard duty.

34:45.146 --> 34:46.480
Oh, it's Heather isn't it.

34:48.148 --> 34:51.318
When I explain about her,
you're gonna feel so silly, you...

34:51.484 --> 34:53.652
Stow it, Falcon.
I'm allergic to baloney.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.321
You should be guarding Serpentor.

34:55.655 --> 34:57.656
Don't sweat it.
Nobody could even get close

34:57.690 --> 35:00.158
to the stockade
without an I.D. bracelet.

35:02.827 --> 35:04.496
And even if they faked the bracelet,

35:04.996 --> 35:07.498
the pene-plastic
shield would stop 'em cold.

35:17.006 --> 35:20.175
But, for the sake of argument,
suppose our mythical intruders

35:20.208 --> 35:22.510
did make it all the way to
Serpentor's cell block.

35:22.844 --> 35:23.678
Yeah...

35:24.178 --> 35:25.346
They'd still have to blast

35:25.380 --> 35:27.848
through a couple o' yards
of super-hard concrete.

35:28.015 --> 35:28.682
Uh-huh.

35:28.849 --> 35:31.351
Then they'd have to get
past three of our best guys.

35:35.188 --> 35:39.191
It's not just unlikely, it's impossible.

35:47.031 --> 35:49.867
The alarm circuit's been cut!
How are you at splicing!

35:50.200 --> 35:52.202
Nothin' like a little on-the-job trainin'!

35:56.706 --> 35:58.374
He must not reconnect that alarm!

36:09.217 --> 36:10.217
Gung-Ho, watch out!

36:22.395 --> 36:23.395
Keep slicing.

36:31.068 --> 36:34.405
No, it can't be!
Oh, brother, you are bad luck!

36:34.738 --> 36:37.073
Hey, you're not exactly
a rabbit's foot yourself.

36:47.582 --> 36:50.251
After them! Deploy the Recon Sleds!

37:06.264 --> 37:11.102
Falcon! Take a good look at what
your irresponsibility cost us!

37:11.436 --> 37:15.105
Because YOU deserted your post,
the enemy force was able to

37:15.139 --> 37:19.275
penetrate security, free Serpentor,
and injure three good men!

37:20.277 --> 37:22.779
You're confined to quarters
until court martial!

37:23.612 --> 37:25.113
Get him out of my sight!

38:14.989 --> 38:16.991
Even their Air Force is ugly!

38:25.164 --> 38:27.166
Prepare the path of the steem.

38:52.520 --> 38:56.691
I, Serpentor, emperor of Cobra,
salute you, most noble one.

38:57.692 --> 39:00.194
Pythona tells me
I owe you my freedom.

39:00.694 --> 39:02.529
Your freedom and your life.

39:03.697 --> 39:09.535
Know that I am Golobulus, supreme
ruler of this kingdom of Cobra-La.

39:10.035 --> 39:13.038
It was I who created you, Serpentor.

39:13.539 --> 39:14.706
You are mine!

39:15.039 --> 39:18.376
No! Serpentor is the product
of my genetic engineering!

39:18.876 --> 39:19.711
Silence, Doctor.

39:20.044 --> 39:21.712
But we combed the
tombs of history's

39:21.745 --> 39:24.047
most powerful leaders for DNA!

39:24.381 --> 39:26.883
Didn't it ever occur to you
that such a brilliant plan

39:26.917 --> 39:30.719
was beyond the capacity of
even your fine intelligence?

39:31.053 --> 39:31.721
But it...

39:32.221 --> 39:34.223
You perceive the facts
correctly, Destro.

39:35.056 --> 39:39.394
I implanted the idea and
skill in Doctor Mindbender's

39:39.427 --> 39:41.729
rather pedestrian brain with this,

39:42.563 --> 39:44.064
a psychic motivator.

39:44.231 --> 39:47.066
I offer you my most
enthusiastic obedience.

39:47.401 --> 39:48.401
And we too!

39:48.901 --> 39:51.070
Then, so say we all.

39:51.738 --> 39:54.240
It is our greater destiny
that concerns me now.

39:54.739 --> 39:57.075
Where is the Broadcast
Energy Transmitter?

39:57.742 --> 40:01.746
I was unable to capture it, but I
shall not fail you again, my lord.

40:02.079 --> 40:04.081
Let's hope not, Serpentor.

40:04.915 --> 40:06.082
I would hate to lose you.

40:06.750 --> 40:10.419
However, you will have other
opportunities to serve me.

40:17.593 --> 40:20.762
First, a graver matter
lies before us...

40:24.264 --> 40:26.934
The trial of Cobra Commander!

40:28.101 --> 40:31.604
Lieutenant Falcon, I can't
understand how an arrogant misfit

40:31.638 --> 40:34.273
like you got into this
outfit in the first place!

40:34.607 --> 40:35.775
They gonna shoot Falcon?

40:36.108 --> 40:38.443
Not now. This is just
a preliminary hearing.

40:38.777 --> 40:41.946
Three good men injured,
Serpentor freed by some

40:41.979 --> 40:45.116
bizarre, new enemy,
all because you can't obey orders!

40:45.449 --> 40:48.285
Your record is a shameful
parade of insubordination

40:48.318 --> 40:49.953
and gross dereliction of duty.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.456
We searched your file, in the
hope of finding some act

40:53.489 --> 40:58.126
of merit to offset the maximum
penalty. We found... none.

40:58.460 --> 41:01.630
If it please the court,
I ask that the defendant be spared.

41:02.297 --> 41:03.465
On what grounds?

41:04.799 --> 41:06.300
Duke, don't.

41:09.970 --> 41:12.806
I just know underneath it
all there's a Joe worth saving.

41:14.140 --> 41:15.641
Falcon is my half-brother.

41:17.977 --> 41:21.647
We should confer on this.
Duke, remove the defendant.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.315
Don't do me any more favors, Duke.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.485
You've done more than
enough already. big brother.

41:28.318 --> 41:29.820
Falcon, Duke's trying to help.

41:30.153 --> 41:32.990
How? By bustin' my
chops every chance he gets?

41:33.156 --> 41:35.158
I promised our mother
I'd keep an eye on him.

41:35.324 --> 41:37.159
Maybe I shouldn't
have taken the job.

41:37.994 --> 41:39.661
He did the crime,
he oughta do the time!

41:39.995 --> 41:42.831
Yeah. Now you might get
penalized for his screw-ups.

41:43.331 --> 41:45.333
Hey! Nobody's gonna
take the rap for me!

41:45.667 --> 41:47.668
I don't need your
help anymore, Duke!

41:48.335 --> 41:49.337
Get outta my life!

41:50.337 --> 41:51.171
Show time.

41:52.672 --> 41:55.842
Lieutenant Falcon, it is
the judgment of this tribunal

41:55.875 --> 41:58.344
that you not be
boundover for court martial.

41:59.512 --> 42:02.681
But you still must answer for
the serious charges against you.

42:03.682 --> 42:07.185
Falcon, you're gonna learn what it
means to be a Joe even if it kills you.

42:07.852 --> 42:10.021
I'm sending you to
the Slaughterhouse.

42:14.024 --> 42:16.693
You have no jurisdiction over me!

42:17.527 --> 42:20.362
Release me at once
or face my wrath!

42:20.863 --> 42:22.031
I promise I'll...

42:25.200 --> 42:28.703
Be silent... or be silenced!

42:30.037 --> 42:36.876
I'll... I am always prepared to
listen to reason, most honored sire.

42:37.043 --> 42:40.379
'Ey, Zartan, why all this
legal-fegal palaver?

42:40.880 --> 42:43.215
Yeah, if they wanna
trash old Chrome Dome,

42:43.248 --> 42:44.717
why don't they just
get on with it?

42:44.883 --> 42:50.221
Because, Dreadnoks, we are
civilized, and a great wrong

42:50.388 --> 42:54.558
has been by inflicted upon
Cobra-La by Cobra Commander.

42:55.225 --> 42:57.394
That wrong must be avenged

42:57.727 --> 43:00.229
in accordance with
our ancient tradition.

43:04.233 --> 43:08.069
Let the web of remembrance
tell the tale!

43:09.737 --> 43:15.742
Forty thousand years ago, the glory
of Cobra-La dominated this planet.

43:16.076 --> 43:20.413
But an age of ice destroyed
much of what we had built,

43:20.747 --> 43:24.917
and with it began
the time of the barbarians.

43:28.086 --> 43:31.589
Surprisingly, they evolved.

43:32.089 --> 43:35.259
If you ask me,
some of them did not evolve.

43:38.095 --> 43:41.597
Gradually, they mastered
a technology based

43:42.265 --> 43:45.434
on inorganic, lifeless substances.

43:45.768 --> 43:50.272
Their culture was a travesty
of our own noble ways,

43:51.273 --> 43:53.941
and a threat to our very existence.

43:54.775 --> 43:57.944
We retreated to
preserve our ways

43:58.111 --> 44:02.448
and await an opportunity
to reclaim the earth.

44:03.449 --> 44:04.950
Generations passed...

44:05.617 --> 44:10.789
And then, a brilliant young
nobleman came to my attention.

44:22.632 --> 44:25.968
Even though disfigured by
a laboratory accident...

44:26.969 --> 44:28.637
he was my choice...

44:28.971 --> 44:32.474
to go into the world
and raise a mighty army,

44:32.974 --> 44:37.311
and to destroy the
so-called human civilization

44:37.644 --> 44:39.980
which had driven us into exile.

44:40.481 --> 44:41.481
You were my hope,

44:42.983 --> 44:44.151
Cobra Commander,

44:44.484 --> 44:48.821
and you failed me... miserably!

44:49.321 --> 44:50.489
I was betrayed!

44:50.822 --> 44:52.157
My troops lack courage!

44:52.491 --> 44:54.159
It was not my fault!

44:54.326 --> 44:55.826
You failed!

44:55.994 --> 44:56.661
No!

44:56.828 --> 45:01.331
Your precious creation Serpentor
defiled your dreams of conquest!

45:01.999 --> 45:05.502
Destroy him I say! Destroy him!

45:18.846 --> 45:22.016
Behold, the culmination of centuries!

45:22.349 --> 45:26.519
The ultimate fruit of
hypergenetic manipulation,

45:27.020 --> 45:30.356
a weapon no enemy can withstand!

45:32.191 --> 45:36.528
In several hours,
these magnificent fungusoids

45:37.195 --> 45:42.533
will mature and launch hundreds
of giant pods into orbit.

45:47.037 --> 45:49.872
The pods will contain spores,

45:50.039 --> 45:54.710
and the spores will degenerate
all organisms they touch,

45:55.210 --> 45:59.714
mutating them into primitive,
incompetent life forms.

46:03.884 --> 46:08.555
When the pods ripen, they will
burst... and shower the earth with

46:08.588 --> 46:15.560
enough spores to reduce the entire
human race into mindless beasts.

46:20.231 --> 46:24.735
Only those beneath Cobra-La's
ice dome will be spared.

46:26.403 --> 46:30.907
But the pods will not ripen in
freezing space, without energy...

46:31.741 --> 46:33.909
and that is why I must have...

46:34.410 --> 46:37.412
The Broadcast Energy
Transmitter! Of course!

46:38.080 --> 46:41.082
Fool! You haven't got the B.E.T.!

46:41.582 --> 46:43.585
You don't even know where it is!

46:43.918 --> 46:45.919
Your plan is laughable!

46:46.087 --> 46:48.421
But your punishment will not be.

46:48.755 --> 46:51.424
Punishment? What about my trial?

46:51.925 --> 46:53.593
It's over, and the verdict

46:53.760 --> 46:57.763
is guilty-guilty of the
one unforgiveable crime:

46:58.263 --> 46:59.264
failure!

47:01.933 --> 47:05.936
No! No! Not the spores!

47:06.603 --> 47:08.605
I'm a citizen of Cobra-La!

47:09.773 --> 47:11.775
NOT THE SPORES!

47:20.616 --> 47:27.121
No! Nooo... ooo... ooo...

47:27.454 --> 47:28.956
Ooh, how bizarre!

47:32.292 --> 47:34.794
Nemesis Enforcer,
throw this worthless

47:34.828 --> 47:37.296
sewage into the
Abyss of Oblivion.

47:38.797 --> 47:41.132
No, put him in with
the Joe prisoners,

47:41.166 --> 47:43.635
so they can see the
fate which awaits them.

47:43.969 --> 47:44.969
I like that.

47:45.303 --> 47:47.138
It's poetic in its simplicity.

47:47.471 --> 47:50.974
A trifle melodramatic, but...

47:51.642 --> 47:54.811
Nemesis Enforcer, take him away.

48:01.650 --> 48:02.984
Yee-haw!

48:03.485 --> 48:04.819
There it is, Lift-Ticket!

48:05.320 --> 48:07.155
Sure don't look cozy down there!

48:07.655 --> 48:10.991
I dont' think Falcon is supposed
to enjoy himself, Wild Bill.

48:11.158 --> 48:14.161
Gung-Ho, Alpine, and Bazooka
aren't exactly enjoyin'

48:14.193 --> 48:15.328
their hospital stay.

48:19.332 --> 48:20.832
Put it on, smart guy!

48:23.001 --> 48:25.170
What for? We're in the
middle o' nowhere. whooo!

48:25.337 --> 48:27.339
Which is right where you belong!

49:06.204 --> 49:06.538
Cobra?

49:18.548 --> 49:20.383
Look what dropped in on us,
brothers:

49:20.717 --> 49:24.053
a hundred and seventy
pounds of air pollution!

49:25.221 --> 49:28.223
I've seen putty with more backbone!

49:29.390 --> 49:33.060
I do not like his face.
Let us remove it, yes?

49:45.571 --> 49:46.905
At ease, disease!

49:50.074 --> 49:51.242
I've been expecting you.

49:52.410 --> 49:56.914
My name is Sergeant Slaughter,
special drill instructor for GI Joe.

49:58.582 --> 50:01.251
That's terrific, Sarge,
but I'm tryin' to cut down on

50:01.284 --> 50:03.753
the chicken sweat just now,
so if you'll excuse me...

50:04.087 --> 50:06.088
You're goin' nowhere, space case.

50:06.922 --> 50:09.591
You're here because you're an
industrial-strength foul-up!

50:09.925 --> 50:13.261
My job is to whip you into
shape, and I'm talkin' whip!

50:13.595 --> 50:15.763
There's only two ways
outta my command:

50:16.097 --> 50:23.770
on your feet like a man, or in a ditty
bag--an itty, bitty ditty bag! Got it?

50:24.103 --> 50:24.770
Yes, Sir!

50:24.938 --> 50:25.605
thats better!

50:26.272 --> 50:28.273
Now straighten up and
meet the Renegades.

50:28.774 --> 50:30.275
They're not real  dependable yet,

50:30.442 --> 50:32.944
but when I get through with 'em,
what're you gonna be?

50:33.278 --> 50:33.945
Perfect!

50:34.445 --> 50:36.447
That's right, per-fect!

50:36.948 --> 50:40.283
Say hello to Mercer,
ex-Cobra Viper who's seen the light.

50:43.286 --> 50:46.789
Red Dog, booted out of pro football
for unnecessary roughness.

50:51.960 --> 50:56.464
And Taurus, a circus acrobat with
a few loose bats in his big top.

50:57.131 --> 50:58.966
Uh, hi, guys.

51:05.638 --> 51:10.476
Okay, now that we're all close friends
, let's head for the Slaughterhouse.

51:10.810 --> 51:12.811
Grab your gear and
start hot-footin' it.

51:13.144 --> 51:17.148
If you're gonna be there in time
for breakfast, it's a long haul.

51:17.649 --> 51:18.649
You expect me to walk?

51:19.150 --> 51:22.820
No, you can run! Yo Joe!

51:44.504 --> 51:47.340
Save my bones for Davy Jones!

51:47.507 --> 51:48.841
He gives me chills.

51:49.008 --> 51:50.175
What'd they do to him?

51:51.010 --> 51:52.511
He looks... inhuman!

51:52.678 --> 51:54.847
Forget that, man,
remember the plan!

51:55.180 --> 51:57.015
When the guards open the gates,
we're gone.

52:10.193 --> 52:13.696
now... Yo Joe! Let's go!

52:23.370 --> 52:26.039
Wait for me!

52:28.375 --> 52:31.544
The world will soon be ours,
great Golobulus!

52:32.045 --> 52:34.880
May your deeds match your words,
Serpentor.

52:36.548 --> 52:37.549
The Joes are escaping!

52:38.049 --> 52:39.384
We must destroy them!

52:39.717 --> 52:44.055
You will find Cobra-La is prepared
to handle all contingencies,

52:44.221 --> 52:45.723
my impetuous friend.

52:48.225 --> 52:51.227
This way out! Yo Joe!

52:56.565 --> 52:58.733
Stop! It's a trap!

52:59.067 --> 53:00.568
Get outta my face!

53:01.069 --> 53:02.737
No! Look!

53:27.091 --> 53:30.927
You see, Serpentor,
there is no escape from Cobra-La.

53:31.427 --> 53:32.429
My buddies!

53:32.762 --> 53:35.097
There's nothing
you can do to save them!

53:36.766 --> 53:40.268
Wait!
I know another way out of Cobra-La.

53:40.602 --> 53:43.438
You can save yourself
and fight again.

53:43.938 --> 53:47.107
So what's your fee?
Snakes don't give for free.

53:47.441 --> 53:48.776
Take me with you!

53:53.613 --> 53:54.614
We got a bargain.

53:55.114 --> 53:57.283
But play it straight,
or there's no doubt

53:57.616 --> 54:00.952
I'll turn your eyeballs inside-out.

54:01.120 --> 54:01.954
This way.

54:12.295 --> 54:14.965
Nemesis Enforcer, dispose of them.

54:27.642 --> 54:28.476
Don't look!

54:29.810 --> 54:30.978
my eyes

54:38.484 --> 54:39.652
I can't see!

54:39.985 --> 54:43.155
I'll be your eyes! Run!

54:47.826 --> 54:49.661
Not that way! To the left!

54:50.494 --> 54:53.330
Now turn! No, straight ahead!

55:19.352 --> 55:20.686
Beautiful!

55:21.020 --> 55:24.356
So begins the dawn
of our invincibility.

55:27.526 --> 55:31.029
Forward!
Our mission is not complete

55:31.195 --> 55:35.032
until we return with
the Broadcast Energy Transmitter!

55:44.706 --> 55:47.042
Useless! All useless!

55:47.376 --> 55:48.710
C'mon! Snap out of it!

55:49.210 --> 55:51.379
Neither of us'll make it
if you don't hang together!

55:51.880 --> 55:55.382
I was once a man! A man!

55:56.383 --> 55:57.050
I can't see,

55:58.719 --> 56:03.389
but I can still... hey,
this is your faceplate.

56:03.556 --> 56:08.894
Was my mask,
just as I was once a man!

56:11.062 --> 56:15.066
I don't like that crazy sound.
Tell me, dude, what's goin' down?

56:15.399 --> 56:18.902
The beginning of the end
of human civilization,

56:19.236 --> 56:22.072
unless you warn G. I. Joe in time.

56:22.572 --> 56:24.073
Then let's move it!

56:26.575 --> 56:29.578
Straight ahead, a mountain path!

56:30.746 --> 56:33.748
That's it! Faster! Faster!

56:55.934 --> 56:58.436
Sorry you missed breakfast,
Falcon (burp),

56:59.770 --> 57:01.605
but that's what happens
when you're outta shape.

57:02.105 --> 57:04.440
Maybe a little K.P.'ll
help you get the lead out.

57:10.278 --> 57:11.780
Jump, yardbird!

57:13.281 --> 57:15.450
You're going to work
till you wish you were dead,

57:15.783 --> 57:18.786
and then keep goin',
'cause you're afraid if you don't,

57:19.287 --> 57:20.621
I won't let you die!

57:22.456 --> 57:25.625
I can't believe Flint hasn't found
a trace of Roadblock's unit.

57:25.792 --> 57:28.460
The Himalayas are a big hunk
of geography, Sergeant,

57:28.628 --> 57:30.129
but we can't wait any longer.

57:30.629 --> 57:32.798
I want you to infiltrate
the Terror Drome and see

57:32.831 --> 57:34.967
if Cobra knows what
happened to Roadblock's men.

57:35.133 --> 57:37.301
Uh, how's Falcon doing?

57:37.469 --> 57:38.636
I'm lookin' at him.

57:39.136 --> 57:42.473
It's too soon to tell yet,
but I think the kid's got potential.

57:42.639 --> 57:45.308
And by the way,
I won't tell him you asked.

57:48.812 --> 57:49.812
Dinner already?

57:50.312 --> 57:51.981
Unless you like snakeburgers.

57:52.481 --> 57:55.651
We're gonna infiltrate the
Terror Drome no Cobra Island.

57:55.984 --> 57:56.985
That's suicide!

57:57.652 --> 58:00.822
Yes. Horoscope say
is bad day to travel.

58:01.322 --> 58:03.824
Think of it as an extra-rough
training exercise.

58:05.492 --> 58:08.661
Training, huh? Then why don't
we leave our weapons behind

58:08.828 --> 58:10.329
and make it really educational?

58:10.663 --> 58:12.331
Now that's what I call a challenge.

58:12.832 --> 58:14.500
No weapons! Let's move out!

58:17.669 --> 58:21.506
Cobra will never think of looking for
the B.E.T. in a civilian security lab.

58:21.839 --> 58:22.840
Let's hope not.

58:23.341 --> 58:26.176
Anyway, it'll be safer here
until our missing buddies return.

58:57.369 --> 58:58.870
Mercer, you know the layout.

58:59.037 --> 59:00.038
How do we get in?

59:00.539 --> 59:04.876
In this stinking swamp, even big,
bad Cobras need air conditioning.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.378
That's our ticket in.

59:14.717 --> 59:16.051
The real men can go in.

59:16.719 --> 59:18.887
The cowards can stay out here.

59:23.224 --> 59:24.725
Central control is that way.

59:28.395 --> 59:31.731
The Baroness has located
the Broadcast Energy Transmitter.

59:33.066 --> 59:35.901
The Joes can't stop us
from capturing it now.

59:36.402 --> 59:38.070
They're off balance
and undermanned.

59:39.071 --> 59:43.574
Strato-Vipers, when the battle is
won, to you shall go the honor

59:43.741 --> 59:46.243
of flying the transmitter
back to Cobra-La!

59:46.577 --> 59:50.914
Hail, Serpentor!
Hail, Cobra! Hail, victory!

59:50.948 --> 59:52.916
You're not fillin'
your brothers in, Mercer.

59:53.082 --> 59:53.750
What's Cobra-La?

59:54.083 --> 59:54.917
I never heard of it.

59:55.251 --> 59:57.419
That answer gives me no comfort.

59:57.920 --> 59:58.421
Pipe down.

59:59.088 --> 59:59.921
I believe him.

01:00:00.256 --> 01:00:01.923
Right now we gotta
warn headquarters.

01:00:02.257 --> 01:00:03.758
Falcon, can you get the word out?

01:00:04.092 --> 01:00:04.926
No sweat.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.595
Then do it.
We'll blow up their armory,

01:00:07.762 --> 01:00:10.097
and rattle reptile
from here to Cobra-La.

01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:40.289
Yo Joe! Yo Joe!

01:00:42.124 --> 01:00:42.458
Come on!

01:00:55.135 --> 01:00:57.637
Come in, G. I. Joe. Acknowledge.

01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:04.809
If they keep shootin', we all blow up!

01:01:10.981 --> 01:01:13.150
Come in, G. I. Joe! Acknowledge!

01:01:34.168 --> 01:01:35.169
come on, lets go'in. Yo Joe!

01:01:35.335 --> 01:01:39.506
It's time to go bye-bye,
or boom-boom! Where's Falcon?

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.341
Who cares?

01:01:46.512 --> 01:01:47.179
We don't need!

01:01:48.013 --> 01:01:50.014
It's time you learned
we're a team, Red Dog.

01:01:50.681 --> 01:01:53.351
We all go home or
nobody goes home!

01:01:56.186 --> 01:01:57.187
Yo Joe!

01:01:57.688 --> 01:01:59.189
How many in your force?

01:02:00.357 --> 01:02:02.192
What is the purpose
of your mission?

01:02:03.192 --> 01:02:05.361
You can't resist forever!

01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:08.697
You're right.

01:02:11.365 --> 01:02:16.037
All I gotta do is hold out
for five... more... minutes.

01:02:17.537 --> 01:02:18.371
Insolent fool!

01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:20.206
If you won't answer me,

01:02:21.708 --> 01:02:24.210
you can answer Nemesis Enforcer!

01:02:33.384 --> 01:02:34.385
Yo Joe!

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:36.721
When I'm through with you,
scuz-bucket,

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:39.556
they're gonna scrape you off
the walls with a squeegee.

01:02:55.737 --> 01:02:59.239
Nemesis Enforcer!
Finish him off, we have work to do!

01:03:00.074 --> 01:03:04.243
Ahh! Nemesis Enforcer! Help me!

01:03:07.413 --> 01:03:08.580
You, you came back for me.

01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.084
Don't get sloppy.

01:03:12.584 --> 01:03:14.752
Just point me at that overgrown bat.

01:03:15.253 --> 01:03:17.421
No time for rematch!
Remember bomb!

01:03:18.256 --> 01:03:18.756
Must hurry!

01:03:21.592 --> 01:03:22.092
Let's get outta here!

01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:42.109
Cobra is finished, yes?

01:03:43.276 --> 01:03:44.778
Don't bet your beard on it.

01:03:57.455 --> 01:03:59.123
I want their heads!

01:03:59.624 --> 01:04:01.125
This I command!

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:08.465
Perimeters are secured, sir!

01:04:18.306 --> 01:04:19.974
Secure the B.E.T.!

01:04:25.479 --> 01:04:27.814
Cobra's after
the Broadcast Energy Transmitter!

01:04:28.148 --> 01:04:30.816
You rally the ground troops.
I'll call out the airborne assault team.

01:04:42.493 --> 01:04:43.661
Yo Joe!

01:04:44.495 --> 01:04:45.495
Hey, wait up!

01:04:46.163 --> 01:04:47.498
There goes our ride.

01:04:47.831 --> 01:04:49.499
That ain't necessarily so!

01:04:53.336 --> 01:04:56.171
I'll hotwire this baby
and we're outta here.

01:04:58.006 --> 01:04:58.673
Fly it, Jinx!

01:05:01.676 --> 01:05:03.177
Yo Joe!

01:05:05.512 --> 01:05:08.515
Ay, carumba! Oh no! Aw, nuts! etc.

01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:11.684
First one to say anything
about my being bad luck

01:05:11.718 --> 01:05:13.019
gets a knuckle massage.

01:05:25.529 --> 01:05:28.031
I can see the whites
of their beedy little eyes!

01:05:35.704 --> 01:05:37.206
Yo J...

01:05:38.707 --> 01:05:39.041
What the...

01:05:45.713 --> 01:05:48.048
Shoot 'em down, whatever they are!

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.056
Okay, Chuckles, let's give
this whirlybird a twirl!

01:06:00.392 --> 01:06:02.727
All right, let's go!

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.909
Okay, guys, prove us
Rawhides aren't raw!

01:06:56.606 --> 01:06:59.442
Man, who ever heard of
being shot down by salad?

01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:13.954
Pour it on, Joes! We can't let 'em
get their hands on the B.E.T..

01:07:14.955 --> 01:07:17.623
Bandits at 12 o'clock high! Regroup!

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.963
Cobra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:28.966
Maintain air attack,
and deploy the Marauders!

01:07:54.488 --> 01:07:54.989
Whoah!

01:08:13.171 --> 01:08:13.671
Open it!

01:08:35.356 --> 01:08:35.856
Wow!

01:08:36.524 --> 01:08:39.192
Inform Serpentor the prize is ours.

01:08:40.861 --> 01:08:42.029
Go for the underbelly!

01:08:42.362 --> 01:08:44.531
These things aren't
invulnerable after all!

01:09:05.881 --> 01:09:06.716
At last!

01:09:09.551 --> 01:09:09.885
What?

01:09:10.386 --> 01:09:14.555
Yo Joe! Concentrate firepower! etc.

01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:19.559
Evacuate the B.E.T. at once!

01:09:24.064 --> 01:09:25.398
Yo Joe!

01:09:27.066 --> 01:09:30.403
Cobra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

01:09:37.908 --> 01:09:38.576
Falcon!

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.582
You, young one.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.086
You nearly thwarted my destiny!

01:09:54.756 --> 01:09:55.256
Duke!

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.766
Die, arrogant earth scum!

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.101
NO!

01:10:13.105 --> 01:10:13.772
Duke?

01:10:17.442 --> 01:10:19.611
He took the snake
meant for your heart,

01:10:20.278 --> 01:10:24.781
but his sacrifice will be in vain!
This I command!

01:10:35.624 --> 01:10:37.292
General Hawk! Bad news!

01:10:37.793 --> 01:10:40.628
Serpentor got the B.E.T.,
and Duke is seriously injured!

01:10:40.795 --> 01:10:42.296
See to him! I'm coming in!

01:10:54.306 --> 01:10:55.140
How is he, Scarlett?

01:10:55.474 --> 01:10:55.975
Not good.

01:11:01.312 --> 01:11:03.481
Looks like I can't look out
for you any more, kid.

01:11:03.814 --> 01:11:04.815
Don't say that, Duke!

01:11:05.649 --> 01:11:06.483
Doc'll fix you up!

01:11:06.817 --> 01:11:08.818
This isn't Doc's day for miracles.

01:11:10.153 --> 01:11:12.822
It's my own fault
I'm too slow.

01:11:13.155 --> 01:11:16.158
No, No, you did it to save me!

01:11:16.825 --> 01:11:19.828
Promise me you'll try
to get your act together,

01:11:20.328 --> 01:11:22.163
be a credit... to your country.

01:11:22.663 --> 01:11:25.332
I, I'll make you proud! You'll see!

01:11:25.999 --> 01:11:27.834
Yo... Joe...

01:11:29.169 --> 01:11:30.670
He's gone into a coma.

01:11:39.345 --> 01:11:40.679
Duke.

01:11:45.183 --> 01:11:46.517
Falcon, don't worry.

01:11:47.017 --> 01:11:49.186
We'll do everything we can for Duke.

01:11:51.355 --> 01:11:52.689
Yo Joe.

01:12:05.366 --> 01:12:08.869
Hail, Golobulus!
Behold, the proof of our victory.

01:12:25.383 --> 01:12:29.720
When this timeworm completes its
journey, the pods will ripen,

01:12:30.053 --> 01:12:35.225
the spores will burst forth,
and this pitiful planet will be ours.

01:12:47.402 --> 01:12:49.737
General Hawk,
I've identified that energy source!

01:12:50.404 --> 01:12:52.239
It's definitely coming from the B.E.T.

01:12:52.272 --> 01:12:54.741
cobra's got it
somewhere in the Himalayas.

01:12:55.075 --> 01:12:55.909
Prepare to move out.

01:12:56.409 --> 01:12:57.911
All I want is Serpentor.

01:12:58.578 --> 01:13:00.579
Just give me one clear shot.

01:13:01.247 --> 01:13:03.915
Not so fast, Rawhide,
you're not goin' anyplace.

01:13:04.582 --> 01:13:05.584
Problem, Beach Head?

01:13:05.917 --> 01:13:08.920
Affirmative. I'm not sure
the Rawhides are ready yet,

01:13:09.086 --> 01:13:10.754
and I'm 'specially not sure about him.

01:13:11.255 --> 01:13:12.089
But, Serpentor...

01:13:12.256 --> 01:13:15.592
Beach Head is right.
The six of you still lack experience.

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:16.927
I have a right!

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.595
What you have is an order, G. I. Joe!

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:22.931
Besides, we need someone to guard
the base and try to contact Flint.

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:24.099
Yes, sir!

01:13:27.935 --> 01:13:30.772
Useless! All useless!

01:13:31.439 --> 01:13:35.776
I was a man! Yessssss...
Oh, yesss...

01:13:36.443 --> 01:13:41.948
I wassssss a man...
I was a man, yessss...

01:13:41.981 --> 01:13:44.616
Stop sayin' that, you hear?
You're makin' me crazy!

01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:52.790
Was a man! Men may rule,
but serpents never! Was a...

01:13:52.957 --> 01:13:55.625
You're goin' snakehouse, man!
You gotta resist!

01:13:56.293 --> 01:13:59.962
Yes! WAS ONCE A MAN!

01:14:00.296 --> 01:14:01.964
Stop stranglin' me!

01:14:06.468 --> 01:14:08.303
There he is!
Hey, it's Roadblock! etc.

01:14:08.637 --> 01:14:11.139
Some rescue party
we turned out to be!

01:14:11.473 --> 01:14:12.974
Roadblock found us!

01:14:13.474 --> 01:14:17.144
Who is it? I don't need to see
clear to fracture your rear!

01:14:17.477 --> 01:14:19.146
Easy, Roadblock.
You're with friends.

01:14:19.646 --> 01:14:22.315
Lifeline? Lifeline!

01:14:26.652 --> 01:14:30.322
Flint! Roadblock!
Hawk's leading a strike force

01:14:30.355 --> 01:14:33.658
to Serpentor's home base,
a place called Cobra-La.

01:14:34.158 --> 01:14:35.993
Patch me through!
We've gotta warn him!

01:14:36.326 --> 01:14:37.328
Warn him? About what?

01:14:37.828 --> 01:14:40.664
Plants, man.
The kind that gobble you up.

01:14:45.001 --> 01:14:46.335
Yo Joe!

01:14:46.502 --> 01:14:47.836
Yo Joe!

01:14:48.837 --> 01:14:51.173
Sound the alarm!
The Joes are attacking!

01:14:51.506 --> 01:14:55.843
I'm aware of that, Serpentor!
I am aware of everything.

01:14:56.177 --> 01:14:59.346
All shall be accomplished
in the fullness of time.

01:14:59.513 --> 01:15:00.180
Yo Joe!

01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:04.851
Hawk, don't send 'em in!
Cobra-La is booby-trapped!

01:15:05.351 --> 01:15:06.018
How, Roadblock?

01:15:06.519 --> 01:15:08.354
Some kinda weird tree, man.

01:15:08.688 --> 01:15:11.022
Where those leaves grow,
you can't survive.

01:15:11.523 --> 01:15:13.858
That giant plant eats Joes alive!

01:15:14.526 --> 01:15:16.861
Get back! Halt! Watch out men!

01:15:21.365 --> 01:15:23.366
Get back! Get back!

01:15:38.045 --> 01:15:39.380
Hey, que pasa, Jinx?

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.382
Hawk and the others were
ambushed entering Cobra-La.

01:15:42.883 --> 01:15:44.217
Look at Cobra Commander!

01:15:45.218 --> 01:15:48.388
Those orbiting pods contain
degenerative spores, and if the

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:52.057
B.E.T. isn't shut down, the
pods will open and release enough

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:55.227
spores to mutate every
man, woman, and child on Earth!

01:15:55.393 --> 01:15:57.395
That's not gonna happen! Right?

01:15:57.561 --> 01:15:57.895
Right!

01:15:58.062 --> 01:15:59.230
Let's win this game!

01:15:59.897 --> 01:16:01.732
I think your vision can be restored,

01:16:02.066 --> 01:16:04.234
but there's nothing
I can do for the snake.

01:16:04.901 --> 01:16:06.903
The mutation process is irreversible.

01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:11.240
Wassss... a man!

01:16:11.574 --> 01:16:14.910
I hear somethin'... and now
I can see it comin' in!

01:16:21.749 --> 01:16:24.584
I never thought I'd be glad
to see you show up, Falcon.

01:16:24.918 --> 01:16:26.920
Thanks, Flint. Now Roadblock,

01:16:27.254 --> 01:16:29.422
how are we gonna get in to
save Hawk and the others?

01:16:29.756 --> 01:16:32.091
Cobra Commander is the
only one who can tell us.

01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:41.766
Which way now, man?

01:16:43.433 --> 01:16:44.268
You hear me, man?

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:50.273
Forget it.
He's completely turned into a snake.

01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:52.608
Now how do we know
which way to go?

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:58.113
Hey, wait! Listen... I think
I just found a back door!

01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:04.785
How come we gotta seal this tunnel?

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:09.789
If we don't, those spores will filter
in and mutate us, you bug-brain.

01:17:10.123 --> 01:17:12.125
You wonna wait
a claim or something

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.295
'Allo, 'allo, allo!

01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:19.297
Adios, adios, adios!

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:33.809
Those fool Dreadnoks!
They fly too close to the carnal trees!

01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:38.647
Wait, those aren't Dreadnoks.
They're... G.I. Joes!

01:17:40.148 --> 01:17:41.649
And Big Lob makes his move!

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:50.324
Uh-oh! Aggressive defense!
He takes a hit, but keeps comin'!

01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:55.328
Will the clock run out before
his mission is complete? No!

01:17:55.661 --> 01:17:56.328
He shoots...

01:17:57.663 --> 01:17:58.497
Is it good?

01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:04.502
Yes!

01:18:15.011 --> 01:18:17.513
Forward! Shoot'em plants.

01:18:30.024 --> 01:18:30.691
Oh, brother.

01:18:36.028 --> 01:18:37.697
Yo Joe!

01:18:54.378 --> 01:18:57.880
General Hawk!
We've gotta shut down the B.E.T.!

01:18:58.047 --> 01:19:00.883
Then let's do it, soldier! Yo Joe!

01:19:09.223 --> 01:19:10.891
They're advancing on the palace!

01:19:12.559 --> 01:19:13.394
They are too late.

01:19:14.394 --> 01:19:18.898
But, to assuage your fears,
I shall take precautions.

01:19:20.399 --> 01:19:25.904
Organisms of Cobra-La,
detach, and defend to the death!

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:45.421
C'mon!

01:19:45.754 --> 01:19:47.088
Yeah! Let's go! etc.

01:20:11.109 --> 01:20:13.611
Yo Joe! Head for the palace!

01:20:48.473 --> 01:20:50.308
Not bad for a first date, huh?

01:20:50.642 --> 01:20:54.145
Yeah, but next time let's watch
a horror flick instead of living one!

01:20:54.645 --> 01:20:58.315
Shut down the B.E.T.!
I'll keep this party going!

01:21:00.483 --> 01:21:00.984
There!

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:04.987
Obliterate them!

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:12.994
Vengeance is ours!

01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:19.000
The big sleaze-bat belongs to me!

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:25.671
you're terrific

01:21:29.675 --> 01:21:33.344
Your brother fell before my wrath,
and so shall you!

01:22:08.541 --> 01:22:10.042
Hold still, witch!

01:22:13.212 --> 01:22:15.380
Prepare for eternity!

01:22:41.902 --> 01:22:43.904
Your life has ended!

01:22:59.917 --> 01:23:03.421
Okay, lady, it's time for lights out!

01:23:04.922 --> 01:23:09.092
Your breath sears your lungs.
Your eyes dim. Your...

01:23:09.593 --> 01:23:15.097
Wasss a man... Yesss...

01:23:15.431 --> 01:23:17.432
Cobra Commander! No!

01:23:51.128 --> 01:23:52.795
I always knew I wasn't unlucky.

01:23:54.630 --> 01:24:00.468
This is for Gung-Ho, Alpine, and
Bazooka! (grunts) This is for Falcon!

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:07.808
(grunts) This is for me! (grunts)
This is for Duke! (grunts)

01:24:07.974 --> 01:24:18.984
And this is for the U.S. of A.!
(grunts) You make me sick!

01:24:21.486 --> 01:24:24.155
Enough! This game is over!

01:24:41.670 --> 01:24:42.671
Falcon!

01:24:50.845 --> 01:24:53.513
You're next, whatever you are.

01:25:02.855 --> 01:25:05.523
I will stain my hands with your blood!

01:25:09.526 --> 01:25:15.031
No one, no one defies
Golobulus and lives! No one!

01:25:29.377 --> 01:25:30.211
Don't give up!

01:25:31.045 --> 01:25:33.547
The last thing you will hear is

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:38.384
the cracking of your vertebrae,
one by one!

01:26:00.236 --> 01:26:02.905
He did it! He shut off the B.E.T.

01:26:03.906 --> 01:26:10.078
Heroic, and utterly futile.
Behold, the pods have matured!

01:26:11.078 --> 01:26:14.248
There is no way to stop the spores!

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.256
You have lost, G. I. Joe! Lost!

01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:25.424
We failed.

01:26:25.758 --> 01:26:26.758
No. not yet!

01:26:27.092 --> 01:26:27.926
What are you doing?

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.595
If I can rev up enough juice...

01:26:34.599 --> 01:26:36.433
You can fry those spores in space!

01:26:56.617 --> 01:26:57.451
It's gonna blow!

01:26:58.452 --> 01:26:59.286
Warn the others!

01:27:00.287 --> 01:27:01.287
Get outta here!

01:27:01.788 --> 01:27:03.623
And leave you? No way!

01:27:04.124 --> 01:27:05.958
Forget me! Save yourselves!

01:27:06.792 --> 01:27:09.962
Falcon, we all go home
or nobody goes home!

01:27:14.299 --> 01:27:16.967
Jump, Falcon! Grab my ankles!

01:28:14.182 --> 01:28:15.517
General Hawk, do you read me?

01:28:16.017 --> 01:28:17.185
This is Doc at headquarters.

01:28:17.685 --> 01:28:19.687
Great news!
Duke's come out of his coma!

01:28:20.354 --> 01:28:21.522
Looks like we've made it.

01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:24.858
Men, Doc says Duke's
gonna be A-OK!

01:28:25.359 --> 01:28:27.360
Yo Joe!

01:28:53.049 --> 01:28:54.383
Look at the sky!

01:28:55.050 --> 01:28:58.386
The last of the mutation
spores are burning up in orbit.

01:28:58.887 --> 01:29:00.888
Thanks, big brother. Let's go.

01:29:01.888 --> 01:33:11.561
