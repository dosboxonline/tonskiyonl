WEBVTT

01:02.020 --> 01:06.024
THE GLORY

01:32.801 --> 01:34.761
<i>71-1 Seonghan-dong, Jongno-gu.</i>

01:34.761 --> 01:36.638
<i>An unidentified body has been found.</i>

01:36.638 --> 01:39.724
<i>I repeat, a body has been found.
We need an officer at the scene.</i>

01:39.724 --> 01:41.392
Unit One is en route.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.497
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available.</i>

02:02.497 --> 02:05.416
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up, check the number...</i>

02:06.584 --> 02:08.002
What the fuck is going on?

02:09.963 --> 02:12.090
I guess Hawaii's not in the cards for you.

02:14.008 --> 02:17.512
It was right here. I left it here.
Wait. Just hold on, just hold on.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.596
Let me...

02:19.430 --> 02:21.391
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available.</i>

02:21.391 --> 02:22.809
Ah, shit!

02:27.564 --> 02:28.690
CHOI HYE-JEONG

02:30.275 --> 02:31.109
What?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.528
<i>I just got a call from Myeong-o's aunt.</i>

02:34.487 --> 02:35.572
Did you know he's dead?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.824
<i>His body was found last night.</i>

02:39.576 --> 02:42.287
You sure have a lot of friends,
don't you, Hye-jeong?

02:42.787 --> 02:44.789
You really kept in touch with his aunt?

02:44.789 --> 02:46.207
<i>What, are you jealous now?</i>

02:46.875 --> 02:47.709
Hey.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.504
You should know more than anyone
how hard it is to keep friends.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.049
You don't even know what's coming for you.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.345
You are totally fucked, Yeon-jin.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.182
Thanks for the heads-up.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.269
It seems like I've just lost two friends.

03:08.563 --> 03:14.068
THE GLORY

03:15.153 --> 03:18.865
<i>You want me to sell the motel?
Why? The business is going so well!</i>

03:18.865 --> 03:22.368
Sell it. Give it away for dirt cheap,
if you have to. Sell it now.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.663
Sort it out with the real estate agent.
Call me when you're done.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.976
Hey. Where have you two been?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.020
You eat yet?

03:49.854 --> 03:51.356
You make some good money yesterday?

03:52.482 --> 03:53.983
We had ramen earlier, so we're good.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.402
God, you guys can't survive
on ramen alone.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.365
Hey, get yourselves some stew, huh?

04:00.949 --> 04:03.243
- Here.
- Wow. Thanks for this, boss.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.496
Still working with Yeon-jin?

04:06.996 --> 04:08.831
Yeah, for a little pocket money.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.251
Right. Keep up the good work.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.044
Don't forget, no minors, okay?

04:13.044 --> 04:14.545
Of course, drive safe, sir.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.463
Sure.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.608
We need to know
how often you drink alcohol.

05:17.608 --> 05:20.611
What are you talking about?

05:21.112 --> 05:23.698
I'm not a drinker.
I swear, I never touch the stuff.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.782
It's not my thing.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.911
Just ask my daughter. She'll tell you.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.331
She's a teacher.
Look at my smart daughter!

05:31.331 --> 05:33.458
You can trust her, can't you?

05:33.458 --> 05:36.586
You were diagnosed
with alcohol dependency six years ago.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.713
Are you saying you've had
nothing to drink since then?

05:38.713 --> 05:44.010
Uh, I actually, uh, had a little glass.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.137
Not even a full one. Basically half.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.473
But I drank it really slow.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.933
How much do you typically drink
once you start drinking?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.852
How many bottles would you estimate?

05:52.852 --> 05:55.396
I said I don't drink, okay?

05:55.396 --> 05:57.398
How dare you accuse me, you fucking quack?

05:59.734 --> 06:02.862
I understand why you brought me here,
you sneaky little bitch!

06:02.862 --> 06:04.781
How dare you?!

06:05.365 --> 06:07.867
You two are ganging up on me,
aren't you? Huh?

06:07.867 --> 06:11.788
- Why did you start the fire?
- The fire? Come on! Hey!

06:11.788 --> 06:14.540
It was really just
a tiny little burn on the floor.

06:14.540 --> 06:19.087
I was just trying to teach my daughter
a silly little lesson, no big deal!

06:19.087 --> 06:22.382
There are fire extinguishers everywhere.
We weren't in any danger.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.258
We put the fire out right away.

06:25.426 --> 06:29.680
I'm fine, she's fine,
everything is fine.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.267
I have everything I need.
We're done here. You can go.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.519
I can go?

06:36.062 --> 06:36.896
Really?

06:42.443 --> 06:45.113
CONSENT FORM FOR ADMISSION
PATIENT: JEONG MI-HEE

06:45.113 --> 06:46.239
FAMILY RELATION CERTIFICATE

06:46.239 --> 06:48.366
Thank you.
We'll get these documents entered.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.123
- Please come this way.
- No! Let go!

06:56.916 --> 06:58.543
Stop, assholes!

06:58.543 --> 07:01.129
Dong-eun! Help! They're taking me away!

07:01.129 --> 07:02.630
You have to help me!

07:02.630 --> 07:04.132
Say something, come on!

07:12.306 --> 07:14.934
This decision is mine to make.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.063
Because I am

07:20.606 --> 07:22.108
the only family you have left.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.161
I have to leave you here.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.081
You fucking bitch!

07:37.582 --> 07:40.251
How could you do this to your own mother?!

07:40.751 --> 07:43.004
I hope you rot in hell!

07:43.754 --> 07:46.674
Get off! Let me go, you assholes!

07:48.342 --> 07:51.804
I'll go with this for the flooring.
And the wallpaper, let's see...

07:53.014 --> 07:55.892
So, what's going on with you and Ms. Moon?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.644
Ah, you startled me. Good to see you.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.147
I didn't sneak up on you.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.482
Have you chosen yet?

08:02.482 --> 08:03.483
No, I haven't.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.903
I'm debating if I should go with
the mid-century modern white,

08:06.903 --> 08:10.156
or if I should choose something
more offbeat, like the Bauhaus grey.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.741
Ugh, it's hard to pick one.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.660
Oh, wow. Too much luxury for a rental!

08:14.660 --> 08:17.830
You know which one he'll pick?
The most expensive one.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.956
Yeah, of course!

08:18.956 --> 08:21.125
You got a new tenant recently.
They leave already?

08:21.125 --> 08:23.711
Oh, no. A unit caught fire.

08:23.711 --> 08:26.214
Oh, I heard about that fire.
That was yours?

08:26.214 --> 08:29.634
Wow, how did that happen?
Are they paying for the damages?

08:29.634 --> 08:32.720
Even if they didn't, I wouldn't care.

08:33.221 --> 08:37.058
I owe Ms. Moon my life,
because she saved it once.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.143
What? really?

09:02.291 --> 09:04.752
Here, drink this.
Tomatoes are good for detox.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.006
Where's Yeon-jin? Where'd that bitch go?

09:09.006 --> 09:11.592
Is that really the first thing
you're gonna say to me?

09:11.592 --> 09:15.137
Can't you see how anxious I've been?
I've lost so much weight!

09:15.137 --> 09:17.139
When do I have to go back?

09:17.139 --> 09:19.892
You'll get a notice to return
to the station sometime next week.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.978
If you cooperate with the police,

09:21.978 --> 09:23.854
it gives you grounds
for a reduced sentence,

09:23.854 --> 09:25.147
so it's best to show up.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.983
Jesus Christ, this sucks!

09:27.650 --> 09:29.402
Where's my old phone? Do you know?

09:29.402 --> 09:32.655
Your old cell phone?
It's probably in your bedroom at home.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.031
Why do you need it?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.576
Important memories are on it.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.662
Of one bitch in particular.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.380
Let's go in there.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.840
- Which one?
- Here.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.508
- Oh, that one?
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.844
- Okay.
- Ugh, so hungry.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.978
Oh shit,
you're wearing matching clothes!

10:03.978 --> 10:06.606
Oh my God, Yeon-jin.
That's so embarrassing.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.817
This is so fucking cute.
You two are like besties now.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.319
Let's capture this beautiful moment.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.862
Shut the fuck up.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.114
Hey. Hey!

10:21.537 --> 10:22.538
Take it off.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.123
Huh?

10:24.123 --> 10:25.791
Are you fucking Deaf like your mother?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.461
Don't make me repeat myself.
Take your clothes off!

10:35.384 --> 10:37.094
<i>I'm sorry, Yeon-jin.</i>

10:38.346 --> 10:40.264
<i>These aren't even real.
They're knock-offs.</i>

10:40.931 --> 10:42.099
<i>This is my fault.</i>

10:42.808 --> 10:45.061
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
-<i>They're knock-offs? God.</i>

10:45.061 --> 10:48.314
-<i>She's running away.</i>
-<i>Yeon-jin is so pissed.</i>

10:48.314 --> 10:50.107
<i>I'm gonna kill that bitch.</i>

10:50.107 --> 10:53.527
-<i>Oh my God, she's so mad.
- Get that out of my face!</i>

10:53.527 --> 10:56.030
MY DAUGHTER WAS A VICTIM
OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE

11:01.744 --> 11:04.372
BULLIED HER BY BURNING HER
WITH CURLING IRON AND CIGARETTES

11:04.372 --> 11:07.875
"A" WORKS AT A BROADCASTING STATION
AS A WEATHER FORECASTER

11:24.558 --> 11:27.144
I keep thinking about
that statement the mother released.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.313
The part of it that said,

11:30.356 --> 11:33.984
"After that class, my daughter fell
from an abandoned building and died."

11:36.153 --> 11:37.321
You think that's true?

11:38.739 --> 11:39.782
That depends.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.118
How deep are you willing
to go down this hole?

11:42.618 --> 11:45.204
Do you want the truth,
or do you want to bury it?

11:49.417 --> 11:51.168
Why did you quit the school?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.671
Was Yeon-jin responsible for that too?

11:55.089 --> 11:56.257
Not entirely.

11:57.007 --> 12:00.678
I'm not that sure
that I would have made a good teacher.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.187
Here's the address for her family.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.647
One person lives there now.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.858
It's her mother.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.778
And you should know the girl's name.
Yoon So-hee.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.032
I heard that...

12:23.701 --> 12:25.619
her body's still frozen somewhere.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.456
Which hospital is she in?

12:29.874 --> 12:31.083
Do you want to move her?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.837
Or are you willing to help me?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.301
Seoul Joo General.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.432
This here is what you asked me
to dig into the other day.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.476
All the details are inside.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.354
You should know, his family owns
Seoul Joo General Hospital.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.318
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.950
10TH ANNIVERSARY
FAMILY OF DOCTORS BECOME PARTNERS

13:09.079 --> 13:11.081
Why did you choose to protect Ye-sol?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.585
You must have known that using her

13:14.585 --> 13:16.670
would have been
the easiest way to torture Yeon-jin.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.800
If I'd done that,
I would have hurt you too.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.593
I don't want that.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.809
Once you finally get revenge...

13:32.353 --> 13:33.604
will you be happy?

13:40.736 --> 13:42.238
I really hope I will.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.951
I want to be happy enough that I...

13:49.286 --> 13:50.454
feel like I could die.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.416
That's how I want to feel
when this is over.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.928
Jesus Christ, answer me, motherfucker.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.848
- HA DO-YEONG
- LET'S MEET UP

14:09.431 --> 14:10.432
<i>We need to meet.</i>

14:10.432 --> 14:12.142
<i>It's important.</i>

14:17.565 --> 14:19.900
I'm guessing you heard
from Hye-jeong, right?

14:21.610 --> 14:22.736
About Myeong-o.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.489
He was found dead.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.324
Since...

14:28.868 --> 14:30.661
you two are living together.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.582
I heard.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.088
I figured you'd be
the first person to know,

14:41.088 --> 14:42.089
outside of his family.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.008
I mean, he did work here.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.344
They said anything? The police?

14:49.179 --> 14:52.933
Like anything about have they determined
his cause of death, or whatever?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.144
I heard...

14:58.397 --> 15:01.108
something about where the police found
Myeong-o's body.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.527
Where was he found?

15:04.361 --> 15:05.821
That abandoned building

15:06.322 --> 15:07.239
where So-hee fell.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.124
I'm really sorry, Yeon-jin.
I swear, I threw all those clothes away.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.042
They're gone.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.047
Okay.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.049
Okay?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.635
Really? Thank you, Yeon-jin.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.639
Of course you should thank me.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.307
And?

15:36.518 --> 15:41.440
Uh... Uh, I... I swear I'll stay
out of your way from now on.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.277
Bitch, I already know you will. And?

15:46.779 --> 15:50.074
Come on. You're not even sorry, are you?

15:50.074 --> 15:53.160
Uh, no, I'm really so sorry,
Yeon-jin, I really am.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.078
You are?

15:55.329 --> 15:57.331
Then you better strip to prove it to me.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.460
Here's the thing.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.797
I just got my hands on a file.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.799
An audio file you'll find interesting.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.971
You were the last person who saw him,
weren't you? At Siesta?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.602
That asshole was actually recording?

16:21.772 --> 16:23.649
Oh. That must be it.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.110
Hye-jeong heard it, too.

16:29.071 --> 16:29.989
What was it like?

16:31.490 --> 16:32.825
Pretty fucking shocking.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.163
God damn it, Yeon-jin. Come on!

16:38.163 --> 16:39.957
So, what are we gonna do now?

16:40.916 --> 16:44.086
I'm still Ye-sol's mother, Jae-jun.
I'm your daughter's mom.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.463
And now you finally know everything.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.468
You have to save me. Save me.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.262
And you have to save Ye-sol.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.264
Jae-jun, you're our only hope.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.892
Tell me the truth.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.729
What did you do to Myeong-o?

17:03.564 --> 17:06.608
It was an accident.
And I thought I took care of it.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.318
I... I don't know why this is...

17:08.318 --> 17:10.070
I just know Dong-eun...

17:10.070 --> 17:11.405
I know she did this.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.075
There's a doctor helping her,
whose family owns Seoul Joo General.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.327
So-hee is inside there right now!

17:18.746 --> 17:19.663
At Seoul Joo?

17:19.663 --> 17:21.832
It feels like everything's falling apart.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.377
I'm gonna leave, okay?
We can come live with you, right?

17:26.253 --> 17:29.214
Ye-sol deserves better
than be the daughter of a murderer!

17:29.715 --> 17:30.966
Will you say it?

17:32.509 --> 17:36.096
I was with you
the day Myeong-o disappeared, wasn't I?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.227
Yes, you were.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.691
You know how much fun
we have when we're alone.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.526
Don't you?

18:12.800 --> 18:15.636
Ji-hyeon.
Where's Ye-sol, is she home?

18:15.636 --> 18:18.222
Uh, your friend's here to see you.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.142
Wow, that's a really
beautiful drawing, Ye-sol.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.103
Want to be my artistic apprentice?

18:26.063 --> 18:29.775
What do you say, Ye-sol?
Do you want to get high? Sound fun?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.487
- Hmm?
- Get up.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.950
Hey! God, what's your problem?
I meant "get hired", not "get high"!

18:37.950 --> 18:41.954
Hey, Ye-sol! I'll make sure you get high
next time I see you, okay? Bye!

18:45.207 --> 18:46.333
You psychotic bitch!

18:46.333 --> 18:49.586
Wow. Shit, you're really the mother
of the fucking year, aren't you?

18:50.170 --> 18:53.715
Wow, you must have spent a fortune
on lawyers. How are you out already?

18:53.715 --> 18:55.300
So it was you.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.261
I was just looking out for you.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.514
You should be careful.
You're running out of chances.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.975
Hey. I know it was you.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.395
That article was
written by the same asshole

19:06.395 --> 19:08.605
who wrote
all those cover stories about you.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.775
Reporter Kang Hyeong-jin of <i>Doowon Daily</i>.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.610
What the hell are you saying?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.028
That's ridiculous.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.364
What's ridiculous is that I got caught

19:17.364 --> 19:20.117
on the same day
people found out about your past.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.995
You planted that shit
so yours would get buried.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.914
Is that why they know about
the tax evasion, too?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.591
Thanks for the heads-up.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.801
It sounds like I've just lost two friends.

19:52.065 --> 19:54.860
It was right here.
I swear, it's the truth!

19:54.860 --> 19:56.612
Why would I bring you here if I was lying?

19:56.612 --> 19:58.363
I don't care!

19:58.864 --> 20:00.782
You have to fix this right now!

20:03.911 --> 20:04.745
Hey.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.207
What the fuck are you looking for? What?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.791
Jesus, what are you looking for?

20:10.542 --> 20:14.171
I'm not going down for this
all by myself, you crazy fucking bitch!

20:23.430 --> 20:25.599
- NEW MESSAGE
- DONG! EUN!

20:25.599 --> 20:26.850
<i>Where are you?</i>

20:28.894 --> 20:30.395
<i>I came out here to see you.</i>

20:30.395 --> 20:31.438
<i>Where are you?</i>

20:35.067 --> 20:35.984
<i>Far away.</i>

20:38.278 --> 20:39.696
<i>How far away are you?</i>

20:42.574 --> 20:43.992
<i>Do you want a ride?</i>

20:58.757 --> 21:01.843
Before you get any ideas, you should know
I already have a crush on someone.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.937
I have two kilometers left
to hit my daily goal.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.273
It's been nice chatting,
but I have to get back to my run.

21:19.569 --> 21:22.572
Do you go jogging often?
You take good care of your body.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.866
Sorry ma'am, I told you
I have a crush on someone else.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.451
You've got stamina!

21:26.451 --> 21:30.080
- Stamina separates winners from losers.
- And who are you trying to beat?

21:30.080 --> 21:33.917
Listen, lady, you've got the wrong guy.
I really do have a crush on someone else.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.918
She's very beautiful.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.713
If you don't get in, I'm gonna go.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.548
Come on, you're not gonna drive away.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.674
I know you're just joking.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.761
Wait! Stop! Hey, wait up!

21:44.761 --> 21:45.762
Come back! Hey, stop!

21:46.847 --> 21:49.766
I've got your license plate number!
Hey! Dong-eun!

22:12.748 --> 22:15.417
That escalated pretty quick.
What's this about?

22:18.253 --> 22:19.838
I just really missed you.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.258
I'm sure we just saw each other.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.970
When we're apart, it feels like forever.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.685
Why have my walls up
when you crash right through them?

22:33.685 --> 22:35.645
Really? You still have your walls up?

22:36.146 --> 22:37.814
Yeah, because you're a sweet psycho.

22:41.735 --> 22:42.903
Of course I am.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.405
Hey, your landlord at Eden Apartments,
do you know her well?

22:46.740 --> 22:48.450
- Do I know her?
- Yeah.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.536
I ran into her and she said
you saved her life. What happened?

22:53.622 --> 22:55.040
I don't think I did.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.377
I don't think I can save myself,
let alone save someone else.

22:59.252 --> 23:02.339
Well, that's obvious,
because you're not that nice.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.049
I take back "sweet."

23:04.049 --> 23:06.093
Hey, can't take it back.

23:07.844 --> 23:10.347
Okay, gotta go. I have one more kilometer.

23:22.859 --> 23:24.277
Let me get this straight.

23:24.277 --> 23:27.072
A missing body has turned up,
and you're wondering if they're gonna--

23:27.072 --> 23:30.742
Simple yes or no,
are they gonna perform an autopsy or not?

23:32.536 --> 23:35.789
If they can't prove it was
suicide or an accident, they have to.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.332
What if the family says no?

23:38.792 --> 23:40.460
What if everyone
in the family's against it?

23:40.460 --> 23:41.378
Doesn't matter.

23:42.045 --> 23:46.049
If the police suspect foul play,
they can request a warrant for an autopsy.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.717
So there'll be one.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.345
And I can't stop it.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.306
You're starting to scare me.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.642
You never ask about anything
other than tax evasion.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.269
Why are you worried about criminal law?

23:57.769 --> 23:59.604
Okay. I'll find a way to deal with this.

24:01.189 --> 24:03.942
- I have to go, I have a meeting.
- Hey, hey, hey, don't just leave!

24:03.942 --> 24:05.986
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

24:08.655 --> 24:10.323
So, this might take a while.

24:11.658 --> 24:12.492
You want a drink?

24:12.492 --> 24:14.494
I'd prefer you get to the point.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.705
Oh, you want to get the beating over with?

24:17.330 --> 24:19.583
Never been beaten, have you?

24:21.084 --> 24:22.419
I can relate.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.463
You're the first guy
who's ever had the pleasure.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.089
I couldn't even fight back.

24:26.089 --> 24:28.758
I said get to the point.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.344
Wow, someone's getting impatient.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.680
Suit yourself.

24:34.723 --> 24:38.101
You already know this place has
a special meaning to Yeon-jin, don't you?

24:38.101 --> 24:40.020
Careful what you say here.

24:45.984 --> 24:49.362
That's a voice recording
on Myeong-o's phone from October 19th.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.615
Take this and give it a listen.

24:52.282 --> 24:55.285
You know Myeong-o.
You were looking for him, too.

24:56.286 --> 25:00.457
The last place he was seen alive was here.
The last person who saw him was Yeon-jin.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.043
That's what I want to talk about.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.547
Oh. There's something else
you should know.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.635
Something I only realized today.

25:12.552 --> 25:13.762
There was an expensive...

25:15.555 --> 25:16.973
bottle of liquor over there.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.600
Pretty good grip on it, yeah?

25:19.100 --> 25:20.101
And now it's gone.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.271
Where is it? Where could it be?

25:24.814 --> 25:27.567
Would you mind asking Yeon-jin
if she knows where it is?

25:29.736 --> 25:33.281
She has very expensive taste
in murder weapons. You know?

25:44.084 --> 25:46.419
- You mean she's, um...
- Yes, she is.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.215
You're married to a murderer.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.389
What do you want me to do?

25:57.389 --> 25:58.765
What do you really want?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.268
Should I report her to the police?

26:01.268 --> 26:02.519
God, you're insane.

26:03.311 --> 26:04.813
I could have done that myself.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.941
We need to help her,
not fucking call it in.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.569
I won't give this to the cops if you swear

26:11.152 --> 26:12.904
to divorce her and give up custody.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.406
That sound good?

26:16.366 --> 26:20.036
I mean, that poor kid, she can't have
a murderer for a mother, can she?

26:20.829 --> 26:22.414
Whether she's your daughter or mine.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.627
Are you...

26:29.838 --> 26:31.590
using Ye-sol to threaten me?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.052
I gave Yeon-jin an alibi

26:37.762 --> 26:39.222
when the girl she bullied

26:41.308 --> 26:43.310
fell off a roof and died.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.688
Now someone else...

26:48.898 --> 26:50.859
she was alone with ended up dead.

26:56.406 --> 26:57.574
So, what do we do?

26:59.326 --> 27:00.869
Is it going to be your turn

27:01.911 --> 27:03.163
to give her an alibi?

27:20.180 --> 27:21.348
Honey, please!

27:21.348 --> 27:23.433
Just tell me what's going on, huh?

27:24.267 --> 27:25.685
Just get in. Come on, hurry.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.108
Go to Ji-min's. I'll be right behind you.
Call me when you get there.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.246
HONG YEONG-AE

27:46.498 --> 27:48.333
- Yeah.
<i>- We need to meet up.</i>

27:48.833 --> 27:50.669
<i>We go back 40 years, Yeong-jun.</i>

27:51.252 --> 27:53.588
<i>We should at least end things
in person, shouldn't we?</i>

27:53.588 --> 27:54.589
What time?

28:04.099 --> 28:06.101
PARK YEON-JIN

28:31.084 --> 28:32.168
Hello?

28:32.168 --> 28:34.629
<i>I'm calling on behalf of
the woman from Pyeongchang.</i>

28:34.629 --> 28:36.339
<i>I'm texting you the address now.</i>

28:36.339 --> 28:37.424
<i>Meet me there.</i>

28:42.929 --> 28:45.223
Shit, I can't believe
this is actually happening!

28:46.516 --> 28:49.102
Dinner's almost ready.
I just need to bring this to a boil.

28:49.102 --> 28:52.856
Ah, Jesus, I'm sick of <i>cheonggukjang.</i>
Aren't you sick of that shit?

28:52.856 --> 28:55.859
After this deal's done,
I'm never eating that shit again.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.610
Don't wait up.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.114
I might be gone for a few days.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.324
Don't even bother trying to find me, okay?

29:20.300 --> 29:22.802
Where are you right now?
Across the street?

29:22.802 --> 29:26.639
<i>Keep walking forward more,
and then cross the street.</i>

29:26.639 --> 29:29.350
<i>- This bag is very heavy, so please hurry.</i>
- You're up there?

29:30.226 --> 29:32.395
Okay, I'm coming.
I'll be there in a second!

29:38.735 --> 29:41.237
Can you at least tell me
where we're going?

29:41.237 --> 29:42.322
We're here now.

29:42.864 --> 29:43.782
I don't know this.

29:43.782 --> 29:47.535
You used to be easier to deal with,
when all you wanted was money.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.621
I guess those days are over?

29:51.581 --> 29:52.791
What do you mean? What is this?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.210
Manslaughter only gets you probation?

29:55.210 --> 29:58.880
And if there's a witness,
it's even more likely to go in your favor.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.274
You weren't watching the road!

30:23.154 --> 30:24.072
Shit!

30:42.340 --> 30:43.341
Is he dead?

30:45.051 --> 30:45.885
Looks like he's dead.

30:45.885 --> 30:47.387
Oh, god. Fuck!

30:51.182 --> 30:53.434
Wait, this is...

30:54.644 --> 30:55.478
What did you do?

30:55.478 --> 30:56.688
There's been an accident!

30:56.688 --> 30:59.566
I hit a jaywalker. He came out of nowhere!
Hurry, send an ambulance!

30:59.566 --> 31:00.567
Shit!

31:02.527 --> 31:04.571
Are you insane? Why'd you call that in?

31:04.571 --> 31:07.615
I wasn't drunk. I wasn't speeding.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.909
All the rain. It obscured my vision.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.872
You're my witness,
so suck it up and help me.

31:15.623 --> 31:16.457
What?

31:17.041 --> 31:19.043
You really think you could play me?

31:19.043 --> 31:22.046
That I wouldn't find out you two were
working together to blackmail me?

31:22.046 --> 31:24.716
What the fuck are you talking about?
In order to get what?

31:24.716 --> 31:27.218
He knew details about things
only we would know.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.344
Who else would've told him?

31:28.344 --> 31:31.347
I have no fucking idea,
but I know it wasn't me, okay?

31:31.347 --> 31:33.391
Have you always been this crazy?

31:33.391 --> 31:35.310
Don't lie to me.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.020
You can't escape this.

31:37.020 --> 31:40.148
This is happening, and you have to
find a way to protect me.

31:40.148 --> 31:43.276
I still have the evidence
that proves we're in this together.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.903
Yeon-jin's name tag.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.447
Fuck, I could kill you!

31:51.743 --> 31:53.578
You've fucking lost your mind,
haven't you?

31:53.578 --> 31:56.748
That name tag would only work
against you and your daughter.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.167
You plan to turn in
your daughter for murder?

31:59.167 --> 32:03.838
How would some housewife even possess
evidence that was handed over to the cops?

32:03.838 --> 32:06.507
It's still sealed,
exactly the way you gave it to me.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.844
Between everyone involved,
who's the most fucked?

32:10.887 --> 32:13.640
Don't you think at least one of us
left some DNA?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.810
This is fucking ridiculous.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.395
Bitch!

32:19.896 --> 32:22.815
What the fuck are you trying to do,
take us all down?

32:23.316 --> 32:25.276
I'm just trying to get what I need

32:25.276 --> 32:27.654
before you run off
like the coward you are.

32:28.154 --> 32:31.908
You would go down with me, no matter what.

32:32.408 --> 32:33.493
So take care of it.

32:33.993 --> 32:37.330
Because whether this kills us
or we come out the other side,

32:37.330 --> 32:38.373
we're in this together.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.666
Right, Yeong-jun?

32:56.766 --> 32:59.268
Light the candle at the shrine,
and then go bleed a chicken.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.186
I will.

33:00.937 --> 33:03.523
Also, did she come with you?

33:03.523 --> 33:04.440
What?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.572
Oh! You startled me.

33:12.657 --> 33:16.619
I'm sorry, the sanctum's not open,
and it's very late, so leave.

33:16.619 --> 33:18.997
Are you only working
with one client today?

33:21.666 --> 33:25.336
Yeon-jin's mother is demanding.
But does that surprise you?

33:27.505 --> 33:29.424
Vroom, crash!

33:31.801 --> 33:33.803
Who are you?

34:07.086 --> 34:08.254
Wow.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.506
Funny running into you here.

34:12.091 --> 34:14.093
What are you doing alone in the dark?

34:16.179 --> 34:18.181
I could ask you the same, Dr. Joo.

34:19.307 --> 34:20.641
I was curious about the building.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.853
What, you ended up here
completely at random?

34:24.771 --> 34:25.855
Both times?

34:27.982 --> 34:29.400
I own this property now.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.821
Oh wow, no way.

34:37.575 --> 34:38.993
I was looking for a bathroom.

34:39.577 --> 34:42.497
God, even I don't believe
I can't think of a better excuse.

35:03.309 --> 35:04.644
OUT OF BUSINESS
DO NOT ENTER

35:12.568 --> 35:13.778
Open the gate!

35:16.030 --> 35:19.283
I'm just trying to keep out trespassers.
Gotta be careful.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.369
Why are you doing this?

35:28.709 --> 35:30.545
What did you do to me the other day?

35:31.671 --> 35:34.757
When you put me under, what did you do?

35:35.800 --> 35:36.759
Procedures.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.388
Your jawline looks more chiseled.
Really thins out your face.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.642
I don't know
what that bitch has said to you,

35:44.642 --> 35:47.478
but you don't know the whole story.
Stay out of it.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.524
Did you know I'm also a dermatologist?

35:52.775 --> 35:54.235
When I look at a wound,

35:54.735 --> 35:56.946
I can see the pain
that the person wanted to inflict.

35:59.198 --> 36:00.825
I know what you did.

36:06.038 --> 36:08.082
You were looking for something,
weren't you?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.293
Is this it?

36:10.960 --> 36:11.961
You can take it.

36:12.461 --> 36:14.589
I already have everything that I need.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.593
And as for the gate, you can just open it.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.429
Those chains are fake.
It's not even locked.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.765
Don't worry,
I won't make you pay for parking.

36:24.765 --> 36:27.810
Because I have a feeling this is
the last time you'll get lucky.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.229
Drive safe out there.

36:31.230 --> 36:35.651
With rain like this,
you wouldn't want to hit anyone.

36:55.671 --> 36:59.759
- NEW MESSAGE
- MOM

36:59.759 --> 37:01.802
<i>I'm at the police station. Pick me up.</i>

37:03.888 --> 37:05.264
<i>It was raining heavily,</i>

37:05.264 --> 37:07.016
and that man came out of nowhere.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.646
They ran a breathalyzer at the scene,

37:11.646 --> 37:13.731
and we can confirm she was sober.

37:13.731 --> 37:16.275
He was jaywalking. She wasn't negligent.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.528
She didn't flee. She has no record.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.989
I think we're done here.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.993
Yes, I'm aware of the circumstances.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.537
Unfortunately, the site
had no security cameras.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.374
We're still trying to get in touch
with the man's family,

37:31.374 --> 37:33.000
so if you wouldn't mind,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.294
you're going to need to stay
a little longer.

37:35.294 --> 37:37.630
As for you, you can head home, Chief.

37:38.297 --> 37:39.882
Okay, good luck here.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.302
Just try not to worry.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.806
When it's manslaughter, try to come
to an agreement with the bereaved.

37:46.806 --> 37:47.723
It's very important.

37:48.557 --> 37:49.392
I know.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.019
Thank you, Yeong-jun.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.106
Uh-huh. I'll reach out soon.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.651
- I'll see you.
- Careful out there, sir.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.569
It was raining.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.780
I couldn't see.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.701
Why did he have to die?

38:06.701 --> 38:09.620
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!

38:11.706 --> 38:13.499
You don't have to
apologize to me.

38:13.499 --> 38:16.877
- So sorry! I'm so sorry!
- Just try to calm down. You'll be okay.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.422
Son Myeong-o's body
was found by the police.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.465
Had you heard about that yet?

38:22.466 --> 38:24.552
I hadn't. Where was he found?

38:25.511 --> 38:26.804
You don't seem surprised.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.973
Have you already spoken to Park Yeon-jin?

38:29.932 --> 38:32.852
Or am I here because I'm a suspect?

38:35.313 --> 38:37.440
We searched Mr. Son's emails.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.152
It seems like he was doing
a lot of research on Yoon So-hee's case.

38:41.152 --> 38:45.364
It appears you were the one feeding him
most of his information.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.825
And is that illegal?

38:48.326 --> 38:52.538
Most of the people around him
are far worse than me. I'm insulted.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.207
What's going on?

38:56.292 --> 38:58.878
What actually happened
between you and these people?

38:59.378 --> 39:03.841
I already told you everything.
The problem was, you didn't believe me.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.344
So, everything you said was true?

39:09.805 --> 39:14.393
WINTER OF 2004

39:32.244 --> 39:33.746
<i>Do you smoke?</i>

39:34.705 --> 39:36.957
On the list of evidence,
there's a lighter.

39:36.957 --> 39:39.835
It was discovered on the ground
at So-hee's crime scene.

39:40.669 --> 39:44.256
So you know when you use a lighter,

39:45.383 --> 39:47.218
traces of DNA are left behind.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.020
Mom!

39:58.729 --> 40:01.315
Do you have your car?
Let's go to the shaman.

40:01.315 --> 40:04.026
Why would we go there now?
What the hell is going on?

40:04.026 --> 40:06.070
I feel more comfortable at the sanctum.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.073
I feel better there
than when I'm with a goddamned shrink.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.493
Do you have
the family's contact information?

40:12.493 --> 40:15.287
You don't have to worry about that.
I'm taking care of everything.

40:15.287 --> 40:18.082
How can you expect me
not to worry when someone's dead?

40:19.041 --> 40:20.960
Reporters are going to have
a field day with this.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.838
Hey, Yeon-jin,
how many times do I have to tell you?

40:23.838 --> 40:28.134
Everyone makes mistakes, but still,
the solution does not lie in the past.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.343
It's in the future.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.470
Somebody died yesterday.

40:31.470 --> 40:33.889
It's done. We have to live for today.

40:34.473 --> 40:35.641
What are you saying?

40:48.612 --> 40:52.158
If that man still has the original file,

40:52.825 --> 40:54.368
I'd suggest you make a decision soon.

40:56.287 --> 41:00.374
If he chooses to leak this first,
this could be very bad for us.

41:06.505 --> 41:09.758
Can you find some small town
in England or Ireland to send Ye-sol?

41:11.260 --> 41:12.845
Her nanny will accompany her.

41:17.683 --> 41:19.018
It's snowing heavier now.

41:23.522 --> 41:24.356
Be careful.

41:25.399 --> 41:27.485
Yes. You too, sir.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.856
KIM JIN-HUN
WE HAVE A DATE FOR YOUR INTERVIEW

42:37.638 --> 42:38.597
Where's the shaman?

42:39.098 --> 42:41.850
She's preparing for a ritual.
It'll be starting soon.

43:02.871 --> 43:03.872
Yeah?

43:04.415 --> 43:09.003
<i>Not sure if I need to tell you,
but that lady you know, Kang Hyeon-nam,</i>

43:09.003 --> 43:11.046
<i>her husband died yesterday.</i>

43:11.046 --> 43:13.132
<i>He got hit by a car while jaywalking.</i>

43:26.645 --> 43:28.272
Is this your husband, ma'am?

43:32.818 --> 43:33.652
Are you okay?

43:34.445 --> 43:35.446
I'm okay.

43:37.406 --> 43:38.282
Yeah, that's...

43:39.825 --> 43:40.701
my husband.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.271
Oh, Yeon-jin!

44:52.189 --> 44:54.858
It's been so long! How have you been?

44:56.902 --> 44:59.947
Hi, Yeon-jin. It's me, So-hee.

44:59.947 --> 45:03.534
I'm Yoon So-hee, the girl who transferred.
Remember me?

45:03.534 --> 45:05.703
What the fuck are you doing right now?

45:06.745 --> 45:08.831
Should I take them off?

45:09.790 --> 45:12.292
Do you want that?
Should I take these clothes off

45:12.292 --> 45:14.420
and give them to you?

45:15.129 --> 45:16.130
What do you want?

45:17.715 --> 45:18.966
What the hell is this?

45:33.939 --> 45:35.607
Go on, strip off all your clothes for me.

45:36.775 --> 45:39.194
Yeon-jin, I'm sorry,
but these aren't even the same clothes.

45:39.194 --> 45:40.863
It's not about what you're wearing.

45:40.863 --> 45:45.159
I care that little bitches like you
don't listen, even when I ask nicely.

45:45.159 --> 45:46.243
Why?

45:52.166 --> 45:55.502
Is this even a sweater?
Or just a gross pile of lint?

45:56.086 --> 45:57.212
You have a minute

45:58.297 --> 45:59.423
before your time's up.

46:09.725 --> 46:10.601
You didn't strip?

46:11.560 --> 46:12.895
I've had enough, okay?

46:16.315 --> 46:18.108
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

46:21.278 --> 46:23.197
You're nothing
when you're all by yourself.

46:24.740 --> 46:27.576
What the fuck
are you even saying?

46:27.576 --> 46:28.994
Is that from a movie?

46:28.994 --> 46:31.079
I'm not scared of you or your money.

46:32.998 --> 46:34.750
When I think about it, I feel bad for you.

46:36.877 --> 46:39.254
So, I've decided to forgive you.

46:41.048 --> 46:43.759
Because I'm a better person
than you, Yeon-jin.

46:46.011 --> 46:46.845
Wow.

46:48.931 --> 46:51.099
Are you calling me pathetic?

46:52.100 --> 46:54.353
You feel bad for me, so clearly you are.

46:54.353 --> 46:57.231
Fuck, that's a lot
to take in at once, you know?

47:00.067 --> 47:01.235
Hmm.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.279
So you wouldn't mind

47:04.279 --> 47:06.865
if this pathetic loser
helps you get this lint off.

47:10.369 --> 47:12.037
You're better than me, right?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.623
You should at least dress the part.

47:15.749 --> 47:17.251
What... What are you doing?

47:17.251 --> 47:18.919
Don't move.

47:18.919 --> 47:21.547
or I'll visit you at your new school.

47:30.472 --> 47:33.767
Go on. Tell me again
how you feel sorry for me.

47:35.352 --> 47:36.270
Help me!

47:38.897 --> 47:40.315
Get away from me!

47:44.945 --> 47:45.821
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL FORM

48:33.076 --> 48:34.077
Mom.

48:34.703 --> 48:35.954
Oh my God, Mom.

48:35.954 --> 48:37.372
What am I gonna do, Mom?

48:37.372 --> 48:40.125
<i>Seriously?
What am I going to do with you?</i>

48:40.125 --> 48:42.044
<i>Why'd you skip your private lessons?</i>

48:42.044 --> 48:44.546
Oh, I think I really messed up.

48:46.298 --> 48:50.218
We were being dumb, just messing around
on the roof, and something caught fire.

48:52.137 --> 48:53.472
There was this girl...

48:55.140 --> 48:57.893
She started screaming
and freaking out and she fell.

48:57.893 --> 48:59.394
It's true, I swear!

49:01.188 --> 49:03.190
We were alone, just messing around.

49:05.651 --> 49:06.485
Mom.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.906
What do I do now? Huh?

49:10.906 --> 49:11.823
Are you there?

49:14.159 --> 49:15.118
Are you there, Mom?

49:15.118 --> 49:16.787
<i>Get a grip, Yeon-jin!</i>

49:16.787 --> 49:20.207
<i>First, get away from there.
I'll have Mr. Shin call you right away.</i>

49:20.207 --> 49:22.250
<i>Stop crying and get it together.</i>

49:22.250 --> 49:24.503
<i>Did anyone see you? Any witnesses?</i>

49:24.503 --> 49:26.588
Uh, no. I don't think so.

49:26.588 --> 49:28.840
<i>You better make sure. Look around you!</i>

49:28.840 --> 49:31.176
There isn't anyone here!
There's no witnesses.

49:37.641 --> 49:38.600
EVIDENCE

49:41.353 --> 49:43.772
It looks like
they didn't do a DNA test at the time.

49:44.272 --> 49:48.110
According to the report, they said
that the lighter was used by the deceased...

49:48.110 --> 49:50.779
- Where are you going?
- The NFS. Meet me there.
