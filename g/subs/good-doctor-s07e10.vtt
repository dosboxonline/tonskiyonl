WEBVTT

00:03.916 --> 00:05.048
[Lea] How long have you known?

00:06.963 --> 00:09.922
[sighs] About a week or two.

00:09.966 --> 00:12.621
My doctor found it
on the yearly scan.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.014
[Steven babbling]

00:15.711 --> 00:19.062
Did they give you
a sense of how long?

00:20.542 --> 00:22.370
-Three to six.
-Years?

00:23.849 --> 00:24.850
Months.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.031
What's your plan?

00:32.075 --> 00:35.035
Is there a surgery or chemo?

00:35.078 --> 00:37.428
No. This is my plan right here.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.517
You. You're it.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.866
You're the plan.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.085
And you.

00:43.565 --> 00:44.653
And that one.

00:47.699 --> 00:48.613
And maybe some bowling.

00:53.618 --> 00:54.619
I have to go to work.

00:57.883 --> 01:00.060
Last time, you also said
it was inoperable. Goodbye.

01:00.973 --> 01:03.063
[door opens, closes]

01:04.107 --> 01:05.456
He just took your medical file.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.067
Yeah.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.287
I'm so sorry, Glassy.

01:18.904 --> 01:19.905
Me too.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.087
[theme music playing]

01:35.878 --> 01:38.533
Despite having you on
vancomycin and ceftriaxone,

01:38.576 --> 01:40.491
your post-op infection
is still progressing.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.232
We're waiting for
the cultures to grow out,

01:42.276 --> 01:43.973
but we suspect MRSA.

01:44.015 --> 01:46.280
I'm thinking we debride
the infected tissue,

01:46.323 --> 01:48.151
then flush antibiotics
directly into the wound

01:48.195 --> 01:49.413
and put in drains.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.545
Good call.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.112
I'll put it on the schedule,

01:52.155 --> 01:53.461
and leave you two alone.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.293
I guess we weren't
exactly subtle.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.337
No.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.256
You said you wanted more
than a one-night stand.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.346
I did.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.828
But, uh,

02:13.785 --> 02:14.786
how would we do that?

02:17.485 --> 02:18.312
I don't know.

02:19.704 --> 02:20.704
But...

02:22.011 --> 02:23.404
I would like to make it work.

02:24.492 --> 02:25.319
Me too.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.365
[chuckles]

02:28.409 --> 02:29.323
[pager buzzes]

02:31.586 --> 02:33.762
Oh, it's Shaun. He wants me in
the Residents' Lounge, stat.

02:34.893 --> 02:37.635
The patient
is a 68-year-old man

02:37.679 --> 02:39.637
diagnosed with grade IV
butterfly glioblastoma,

02:39.680 --> 02:41.770
from the left
frontotemporal lobe.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.121
Do we have
a full medical record?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.209
Patient history?

02:46.253 --> 02:47.732
Or a name?

02:47.776 --> 02:50.170
Successful surgical resection
for glioma five years ago,

02:50.213 --> 02:51.388
followed by
chemo and radiation.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.911
And within the past year,

02:52.954 --> 02:54.043
several minor strokes.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.785
Glioma and strokes.

02:57.655 --> 02:58.352
Are those Glassman's?

03:00.397 --> 03:01.790
His cancer's back?

03:01.833 --> 03:05.402
The patient's identity
isn't medically relevant.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.796
How is he? How are you, Shaun?

03:09.711 --> 03:11.321
The patient's identity
isn't medically relevant.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.804
Shaun, did Dr. Glassman
ask you to develop a treatment?

03:15.847 --> 03:18.241
No, he didn't.
Otherwise, he'd be here.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.201
The patient is reluctant
to pursue treatment,

03:21.244 --> 03:23.464
but the patient is also
not aware of new developments.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.422
You and Jordan go do
Claire's debridement.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.079
I'm sorry, Shaun. I can't.

03:39.305 --> 03:43.005
Looking at the axial images
with contrast...

03:49.925 --> 03:52.188
How's Claire?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.364
Looks like MRSA. We've got her
on vanc and ceftriaxone.

03:57.715 --> 03:58.454
Rack 'em up.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.285
Said the woman who
hates the fact that there's

04:02.329 --> 04:04.418
a pool table in
the president's lounge

04:05.157 --> 04:06.246
to a dying man?

04:08.857 --> 04:10.641
Shaun?

04:10.685 --> 04:13.949
He's got a group brainstorming
a treatment plan for you.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.082
-I'll rejoin them
if you want me to.
-No.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.174
Thank you.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.790
Hey, look at the bright side.

04:28.832 --> 04:31.532
When I'm gone,
no more co-presidency.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.882
You can run this joint
however you want.

04:33.925 --> 04:36.058
I never wanted it
in the first place.

04:36.101 --> 04:38.060
Stop. You're a natural.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.282
Even if you are overly invested
and too accessible...

04:45.633 --> 04:48.418
In every other way,
you're amazing.

04:54.859 --> 04:55.860
This sucks.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.390
Shut up and rack 'em.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.660
[Jared] No sign of any more
devascularized tissue.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.531
[Jordan] Proceeding with
antibiotic irrigation.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.319
Looked like you two were
reconnecting last night.

05:20.581 --> 05:21.538
[Jared] Yeah.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.715
Did that...
Does that bother you?

05:26.761 --> 05:28.328
It caught me
off guard a little.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.332
You could have told me you two
had unfinished business.

05:33.681 --> 05:34.464
You're with Perez.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.642
Danny and I are texting a lot,

05:38.686 --> 05:41.993
and, yes, I do hope and pray
my future is with him.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.691
That's why I backed off
and stopped flirting with you.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.519
You and me, we're friends.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.391
Placing the drain.

05:50.611 --> 05:53.614
Thing about friends is,
no holding out.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.485
I told you about me and Danny,
you tell me

05:55.529 --> 05:58.140
when your ex you're not over
is back in town.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.446
I can close.

06:00.664 --> 06:01.361
Deal.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.189
To both.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.584
I'll go check on the cultures,

06:07.628 --> 06:08.977
see which antibiotics
are working.

06:27.952 --> 06:30.651
Shaun, have you tried calling
the Tisch Brain Tumor Center

06:30.694 --> 06:32.827
or Cleveland Clinic about
their in-progress GBM trials?

06:34.306 --> 06:38.180
That is an excellent idea.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.486
I'll keep things rolling here.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.579
Come on, guys,
I need some energy,
some enthusiasm.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.668
Stop pitching the same idea.
Start pitching any idea.

06:47.711 --> 06:50.235
I ran out an hour ago.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.281
How long are we supposed
to keep doing this?

06:52.324 --> 06:53.891
Until Shaun accepts
what we already know.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.851
That there is no treatment.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.952
-What do you got?
-Nothing's working.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.607
Not a single antibiotic made
a dent in Claire's infection.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.264
It's not MRSA.

07:27.707 --> 07:30.014
We cleared out
all the infected tissue,

07:31.581 --> 07:34.845
but initial cultures confirm
you don't have MRSA.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.020
You have acinetobacter.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.329
It's resistant to everything.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.113
One of the antibiotic combos
slowed growth a little.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.028
We'll try that.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.161
But mostly, we need
your immune system
to beat this thing.

07:49.207 --> 07:49.947
Are you scared?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.864
I heard about Glassman.
How's he holding up?

07:56.432 --> 07:58.695
Better than the rest of us,
I think.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.523
At least, he's acting like it.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.265
Congratulations.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.225
I assume they'll
offer you the presidency.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.576
-[scoffs]
-Look,

08:09.619 --> 08:11.316
it is a terrible way
to get the offer,

08:11.360 --> 08:13.710
but it is still
a huge accomplishment.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.063
[sighs] There's another offer.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.805
Chief of surgery
at the hospital

08:21.849 --> 08:24.765
where Clay's doing
his fellowship in Chicago.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.290
I'd get to focus
on surgery again,

08:28.332 --> 08:30.118
be with Clay again.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.077
But?

08:37.081 --> 08:38.735
How did you know it was
the right choice

08:39.996 --> 08:40.955
to move to Guatemala?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.178
It made me want to throw up.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.919
[both chuckle]

08:48.963 --> 08:51.748
It was soterrifying.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.013
But in an exhilarating
kind of way.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.106
What?

09:02.150 --> 09:03.630
You're sweating.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.422
[knock on door]

09:15.598 --> 09:18.253
I'm looking for
stuff to scavenge.

09:19.210 --> 09:19.907
Oh, well, help yourself.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.651
Just stay away from the scotch.
I'm gonna need that.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.179
Tell me about your bucket list.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.572
Bucket list? Hmm.

09:33.268 --> 09:34.835
[chuckles]

09:34.878 --> 09:38.055
Criss-cross the Serengeti with
a backpack and a pitch tent.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.057
Wrestle an alligator and win.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.277
Or go bowling.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.626
I didn't take you
for a Pin Prince.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.237
A bowler?

09:46.281 --> 09:48.413
I'm kind of
a Strike Siren myself.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.068
Park and I are in a league.

09:53.027 --> 09:53.854
I wasn't expecting that.

10:04.168 --> 10:04.952
I know what I want.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.700
When you were treating
my rheumatoid arthritis,

10:13.743 --> 10:14.701
there was this

10:15.876 --> 10:17.486
one day when you were
going over my

10:18.661 --> 10:20.924
X-rays and blood work

10:20.968 --> 10:23.927
and medical history,

10:23.971 --> 10:26.538
all this stupid paperwork
about me and my stupid hands,

10:26.582 --> 10:29.541
and it all felt
so overwhelming.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.243
And then you gathered it up
into this nice, neat pile,

10:35.286 --> 10:36.679
and you
paper-clipped it together.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.642
And all of a sudden,
it felt manageable, like,

10:44.339 --> 10:45.862
maybe I would be okay.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.783
Also, I can use it
to jimmy open

10:53.827 --> 10:55.263
the filing cabinet
in my office.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.133
I can't find the key.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.446
Thank you.

11:19.591 --> 11:20.897
I sense you've cracked it.

11:20.941 --> 11:23.595
No, we've made
no progress at all.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.297
Shaun, we've been
at this all day.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.299
It's only 3:15.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.083
We've been at this
for over seven hours,

11:33.127 --> 11:34.563
with six people
looking non-stop.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.697
If there was
a miracle cure to find,

11:38.915 --> 11:40.047
-I think we would've--
-I found something!

11:45.705 --> 11:47.794
A maximal resection
would debulk the tumor

11:47.837 --> 11:49.578
down to
a one-centimeter margin.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.449
Minimally invasive techniques
could be used.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.625
You would only be
in the hospital for
one to two nights,

11:53.669 --> 11:56.019
and overall recovery
would be faster

11:56.063 --> 11:58.152
because they wouldn't be
operating in the brain stem.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.457
[Charlie] The surgery
would be followed

11:59.501 --> 12:01.155
by an experimental
ultrasound therapy.

12:01.198 --> 12:04.114
Thank you. An experimental
ultrasound therapy,

12:04.158 --> 12:05.637
breaking down
the blood-brain barrier

12:05.681 --> 12:08.771
to increase chemo penetration,
allowing for a lower dose.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.686
There would still be
some side effects,

12:10.730 --> 12:12.819
but we could take
more edibles together

12:12.862 --> 12:15.125
and eat Mallomars. Mm.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.876
It could give you
as much as a year.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.573
Maybe more,
if you respond well.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.924
[cellphone vibrates]

12:33.230 --> 12:35.189
Claire is in septic shock.
I have to go.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.759
I will be back later
to answer any questions.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.414
[door opens, closes]

12:43.458 --> 12:44.764
[Dr. Lim] Temp's 103.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.418
BP's low, cardiac output
is declining.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.072
We could do another
wound debridement.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.161
It's in her blood. The wound is
not the biggest issue anymore.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.076
But clearing it out
allows her immune system

12:53.120 --> 12:54.469
to focus its resources
elsewhere.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.167
Not enough. We could try
a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.429
[Claire] Guys.

12:58.473 --> 12:59.996
We all know the answer.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.436
You have to put me in a coma.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.221
-No.
-We're not there yet.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.051
We are.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.753
Shutting down your
other metabolic demands

13:17.797 --> 13:19.799
will allow your body to

13:19.842 --> 13:21.975
focus on fighting
the infection.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.806
I know, once you put me under,

13:27.719 --> 13:28.895
that may be...

13:34.683 --> 13:37.599
But this is my best chance
to beat this thing.

13:43.257 --> 13:43.997
[sighs]

13:53.093 --> 13:53.833
Hey.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.925
Have you looked over
the materials?

13:58.968 --> 14:01.231
I highlighted
relevant sections.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.494
I have, and I appreciate

14:03.538 --> 14:04.626
what you're trying
to do, Shaun.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.454
Yes. It is a very good plan.

14:06.497 --> 14:07.759
I'm not going to do it.

14:09.587 --> 14:12.677
I don't want to spend
my remaining days
sick and in pain.

14:12.721 --> 14:15.071
I might not be able
to talk normally.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.073
I might not be able
to walk normally.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.683
I'll have memory loss.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.947
Oh, there is
a less than 20% chance.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.035
I don't want to take
that chance.

14:23.819 --> 14:26.082
But it could give you
more time.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.087
A year, maybe,

14:31.131 --> 14:33.263
and in and out of hospitals
half the time.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.961
Or, Shaun,

14:35.004 --> 14:38.355
or I could do nothing

14:38.399 --> 14:39.487
and have six good months.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.882
I could spend those good months

14:42.925 --> 14:44.448
with you and Lea

14:45.667 --> 14:46.668
and Steve.

15:18.961 --> 15:19.919
[timer ringing]

15:26.664 --> 15:27.970
[timer ringing]

15:43.594 --> 15:44.944
Please don't touch anything.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.428
Glassman rejected the plan.

15:51.472 --> 15:54.083
His three concerns were
impairment of motor and speech,

15:54.127 --> 15:56.390
loss of memory,
side effects of the chemo.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.566
I just need to find ways
to mitigate those risks.

16:07.836 --> 16:08.968
You are just standing there.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.974
You are here to tell me
to stop working

16:15.017 --> 16:17.063
on Dr. Glassman's case.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.240
No, Shaun.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.633
It's your choice.

16:26.072 --> 16:26.986
[timer ringing]

16:45.265 --> 16:47.832
The rocuronium will
temporarily paralyze you

16:47.876 --> 16:50.139
to make intubation easier.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.446
Once the tube is in, we'll do
a continuous propofol drip.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.015
You ready?

17:04.414 --> 17:06.415
[sniffles]

17:14.032 --> 17:15.121
I forgot a med.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.257
[breathes shakily]

17:22.084 --> 17:23.215
I can't say goodbye.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.045
Just got you back.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.222
I love you.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.660
I...

17:32.703 --> 17:34.140
I'm so sorry

17:35.054 --> 17:36.881
we lost so much time.

17:38.622 --> 17:39.623
Hey.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.150
We needed that time
to get back here.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.196
We weren't ready before.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.460
-We were too dumb.
-[laughs]

17:51.766 --> 17:52.897
We were so dumb.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.290
[gasps softly]

17:59.208 --> 18:01.167
But I did tell you
that I think, one day,

18:01.993 --> 18:03.517
we'd both be very happy.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.739
I just didn't realize
it would be together.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.094
I love you, too, Claire Browne.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.750
[exhales]

18:19.794 --> 18:21.448
And I really wish
I could kiss you right now.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.115
Where is Shaun?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.211
Claire's asking for you.

18:45.254 --> 18:48.431
I am working on her case.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.781
Currently, I'm working
on Dr. Glassman's,

18:50.825 --> 18:53.915
but I will switch back
in 3 minutes and 27 seconds.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.612
She might not wake up, Shaun.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.137
She wants to say goodbye.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.227
I will find a way
to save them both.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.447
Oncolytic viruses
have been used to infect

19:04.491 --> 19:07.885
and destroy cancer cells,
but the viruses won't work

19:07.929 --> 19:10.888
because Dr. Glassman's tumor
was previously EGFR negative...

19:10.932 --> 19:12.673
-Shaun.
-...so there is no target
for the virus to attach to,

19:12.716 --> 19:15.284
-but if I could find
a different receptor --
-Shaun.

19:15.328 --> 19:18.809
Your very good friend,
who might die,

19:18.853 --> 19:21.421
is asking for
a few minutes of your time,

19:21.464 --> 19:23.814
but you're too busy ignoring
the expressed wishes

19:23.858 --> 19:25.033
of your other friend
who's dying.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.604
I know you're scared.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.435
But you're being a bad friend

19:35.478 --> 19:38.046
when the people you love
could really use a good one.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.913
I know how to save Claire.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.268
Hello. We can use viruses

20:26.312 --> 20:28.618
to cure Claire's
bacterial infection.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.533
Bacteriophages, to be precise.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.579
They are viruses
that attack and infiltrate

20:32.622 --> 20:35.495
only bacteria, and then
destroy them from the inside.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.540
Every bacteriophage
only infects certain kinds
of bacteria.

20:37.584 --> 20:38.889
All we need to do is find one

20:38.933 --> 20:40.891
that will attack
Claire's infection.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.328
There are billions of phages.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.807
Are any of them known
to work on acinetobacter?

20:45.156 --> 20:46.984
-No.
-[Jordan] So, we're searching

20:47.028 --> 20:49.813
through a billion haystacks
for one needle?

20:49.857 --> 20:51.424
[Shaun] Not exactly.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.774
Each phage can attack
more than one kind of bacteria,

20:53.817 --> 20:56.864
so it is more like searching
a billion haystacks

20:56.907 --> 20:58.300
for a million needles.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.693
[Dom] And where are
we supposed to find these

20:59.736 --> 21:01.434
haystacks, or needles?

21:01.477 --> 21:03.653
Bacteriophages. The metaphor
is not helping.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.481
We need to collect the phages,

21:05.525 --> 21:07.353
as many as we can,
as fast as we can.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.137
[Charlie] Phage therapy
is experimental.

21:09.180 --> 21:12.488
We would need a compassionate
use authorization from the FDA,

21:12.532 --> 21:14.360
-but they've--
-But that's tomorrow's problem.

21:14.403 --> 21:15.535
Today, we've got to find
the right phage.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.234
According to
the microbiology department

21:19.278 --> 21:20.670
of the CDC,
the most common sources

21:20.714 --> 21:22.324
of bacteriophages are swamps,

21:22.368 --> 21:24.065
farms, storm drains,
and sewage plants.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.245
I noticed her left forearm
felt cold with a weak pulse.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.203
-Septic emboli?
-Poor blood flow.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.379
Already showing signs
of ischemia.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.469
We can do a thrombectomy,

21:36.512 --> 21:38.471
try to remove the clot
and slow progress of infection.

21:38.514 --> 21:41.212
Her body's putting a ton of
resources into saving this arm,

21:41.256 --> 21:42.736
which is taking energy away
from saving her vital organs.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.174
She can live without an arm.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.218
[sighs]

21:48.481 --> 21:49.656
Let's try
the thrombectomy first.

21:50.874 --> 21:51.745
We need transport.

21:55.444 --> 21:58.186
I have taken your concerns
into account

21:58.229 --> 21:59.535
and formed
a new treatment plan.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.061
I don't want
a new treatment plan, Shaun.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.149
You don't know.
You haven't looked.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.544
We will do
a fluorescence-guided

22:08.588 --> 22:11.591
awake brain surgery
with cortical stimulation.

22:11.634 --> 22:14.898
Shaun, I appreciate that
you're doing this out of,

22:14.942 --> 22:16.509
you know, love.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.162
But sometimes
when you love someone,

22:18.206 --> 22:20.077
you don't have to
fight every fight.

22:20.121 --> 22:23.429
You don't have to persevere
to the ends of the earth.

22:23.472 --> 22:24.778
Sometimes, when you
love someone,

22:24.821 --> 22:27.433
you just, you know,
take 'em bowling.

22:27.476 --> 22:30.436
Six years ago,
you didn't give up,

22:30.479 --> 22:32.438
and you got to see me
get married.

22:32.481 --> 22:33.830
You got to meet your grandson.

22:33.874 --> 22:34.918
You got to save more lives.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.746
You were wrong then,

22:36.790 --> 22:39.314
-and you are wrong now.
-Shaun, look at me, please.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.055
Listen to me.
Look at me, please!

22:44.363 --> 22:46.365
Is my tumor recurrent,
yes or no?

22:48.584 --> 22:49.803
Yes.

22:49.846 --> 22:52.545
Is it aggressive?
Is it even more aggressive?

22:56.940 --> 22:59.987
There are
better treatments now.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.380
We just need to
buy you some time.

23:03.599 --> 23:04.644
I shouldn't have told you.

23:07.777 --> 23:08.996
[thud]

23:13.043 --> 23:14.218
You are being selfish.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.746
And you are a coward.

23:21.791 --> 23:25.055
You could keep fighting
and have more time with me

23:25.099 --> 23:27.275
and with Lea and with Steve,
but you are giving up.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.843
You are giving up on all of us.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.497
[breathes shakily]

23:38.852 --> 23:40.419
If you are giving up on me...

23:43.247 --> 23:44.901
then I have to give up on you.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.189
[Dr. Lim]
The thrombectomy didn't
fully clear the blood clot.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.713
It's obstructing blood flow,

24:13.756 --> 24:15.584
and the arm is showing
signs of necrosis.

24:17.978 --> 24:18.674
I think we need to amputate.

24:20.110 --> 24:22.635
Or we could try
an open thrombectomy.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.375
It'll give us better access
to the clot.

24:24.419 --> 24:26.247
It'll also risk seeding
the infection to other places.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.596
We could start a heparin drip,

24:27.640 --> 24:28.989
see if it'll give us
better blood flow.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.686
The arm is taking resources

24:30.730 --> 24:32.296
the rest of her body
desperately needs.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.907
Her creatinine and LFTs
are trending up.

24:33.950 --> 24:36.170
Her liver and her kidney
are starting to fail.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.432
Putting off amputation
any longer,

24:37.476 --> 24:38.477
it risks her life.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.569
She wouldn't be
a surgeon anymore.

24:45.614 --> 24:49.488
She loves her job
and is very good at it.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.100
I know.

24:58.018 --> 24:58.758
But what she loves

25:01.064 --> 25:03.327
is the young girl in Guatemala
who walked half a day

25:03.371 --> 25:04.503
to the hospital
with a broken ankle.

25:06.809 --> 25:09.333
And the old man who
just lost his wife of 52 years

25:11.553 --> 25:12.685
and needed someone
to hold his hand.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.168
And the first-year
surgical resident

25:19.996 --> 25:21.563
who was different,

25:21.607 --> 25:23.217
but she saw something
special in him.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.832
Claire loves people,

25:29.876 --> 25:31.573
and she will find a way
to take care of people,

25:31.617 --> 25:32.748
no matter what.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.620
And I think,
if she was here right now,

25:34.663 --> 25:36.404
listening to all of this,
she would tell us

25:36.447 --> 25:38.232
to take her damn arm

25:38.275 --> 25:39.929
and trust that she will find
a way forward,

25:39.973 --> 25:41.496
because she...

25:41.540 --> 25:42.715
she always has.

25:52.463 --> 25:53.464
Prep the OR.

26:10.307 --> 26:12.571
I thought you could use
some baby snuggles.

26:13.963 --> 26:14.703
[chuckles]

26:15.878 --> 26:17.097
You have no idea.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.272
[Lea] Mm.

26:19.621 --> 26:20.579
Come here.

26:22.363 --> 26:23.669
Come here. I gotcha.

26:24.278 --> 26:25.409
I gotcha.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.237
Hi.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.805
Hi. I gotcha. I gotcha.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.026
[sighs] I said no to

26:33.722 --> 26:35.985
Shaun's plan twice.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.688
I thought he'd be ready to

26:43.602 --> 26:46.953
accept this eventually.

26:46.996 --> 26:50.391
Well, "eventually" probably
means more than 48 hours.

26:55.526 --> 26:56.919
[sighs]

26:56.963 --> 26:59.052
I spent a couple of decades
trying to prepare him

27:00.749 --> 27:02.708
for when I

27:02.751 --> 27:04.666
wasn't going
to be around anymore.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.671
Apparently, that wasn't enough.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.025
Glassy...

27:18.637 --> 27:19.812
I love you.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.119
You are the first-wisest

27:23.163 --> 27:26.340
and second-smartest person
I know,

27:26.383 --> 27:28.821
but if you think you
haven't done enough for Shaun,

27:28.864 --> 27:30.692
then I am sorry,
but you are a ginormous idiot.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.869
Look at who you're holding.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.960
That baby is here
because of what you did.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.832
I'mhere
because of what you did.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.357
You saw who he was,
who he could be.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.924
You saved his life,
and he knows it.

27:48.318 --> 27:49.319
He will come around...

27:51.539 --> 27:52.671
eventually.

27:55.064 --> 27:55.804
Hi.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.286
He doesn't have
a whole lot of time.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.906
[monitor beeps,
respirator hissing]

28:18.914 --> 28:19.872
[Dr. Lim] 10-blade.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.161
We've concluded our tour
of the most disgusting barns

28:48.204 --> 28:49.466
in Northern California.

28:49.510 --> 28:53.427
I have received hundreds
of phages from the CDC.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.734
Charlie and Dom
are on their way with 87.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.952
Have any showed promise so far?

28:58.345 --> 28:59.607
None whatsoever.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.393
Shaun, uh, can I talk to you?

29:05.047 --> 29:06.309
I have samples to test.

29:08.398 --> 29:09.443
Uh, it's important.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.228
We'll keep gathering.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.883
I know of
a slaughterhouse nearby.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.755
-[Dr. Park] You know
of a slaughterhouse?
-[Dr. Reznick] Mm-hmm.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.025
You can't shut Glassman out.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.376
I presented him with two plans.

29:29.419 --> 29:30.725
He doesn't want them.
That's his choice.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.596
His choice is wrong.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.816
No, it isn't, Shaun.

29:45.087 --> 29:48.830
I know how hard it is
for you to accept.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.701
I know you don't want
to face any of this,

29:52.268 --> 29:53.966
but Glassman is dying, Shaun.

been doing to try to save him

30:01.016 --> 30:01.974
is really for you.

30:04.498 --> 30:05.978
You need a new plan.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.503
A plan to say goodbye.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.943
Right now, you can't
make yourself feel okay

30:14.987 --> 30:16.989
about Glassman's decision,
and that is okay.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.904
You don't have to.

30:20.122 --> 30:20.819
But...

30:23.691 --> 30:26.085
he isgoing to die,

30:26.128 --> 30:28.870
and if you are not with him
for his final days,

30:30.350 --> 30:32.439
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

30:36.486 --> 30:37.487
So...

30:39.663 --> 30:41.056
you need to plan

30:41.100 --> 30:42.841

with your father.

You are a very good friend.

-Yes!

32:23.463 --> 32:26.074

32:26.118 --> 32:27.423

What else would I have meant?

32:28.990 --> 32:30.035
Oh-ye!

32:35.823 --> 32:37.477
I told you. I was not wrong.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.782
I was not wrong
to not say goodbye.

32:46.442 --> 32:48.444

were very striking,

of endotoxins.

32:50.533 --> 32:53.623
Oh, also, uh, her amputated arm
isn't strictly relevant,

32:53.667 --> 32:55.625

for a compassionate use,

make her appear

32:56.757 --> 32:58.193

will be helpful.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.032

33:13.339 --> 33:15.123
But the whole point
of a compassionate use

33:15.167 --> 33:17.169
is to allow people
with no other option.

the bacteriophage treatment.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.437
Is Claire going to be okay?
Why did you text us?

34:09.569 --> 34:10.309
I texted you

34:11.571 --> 34:14.791
because when I have
important news,

34:14.835 --> 34:17.054
you two are the people

34:34.420 --> 34:36.987
that just because you
love somebody doesn't mean

34:37.031 --> 34:38.511
you get to love them forever.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.560
But I was okay

34:45.996 --> 34:48.650
because I had you,
Dr. Glassman.

34:52.655 --> 34:53.743
And on the day that...

34:59.271 --> 35:01.751

to go to with Maddie,

after you're gone, and I will.

in this room,

35:57.851 --> 36:01.333

I want to save people

Hello.

41:29.661 --> 41:32.490
Dr. Glassman and I
saved her life.

41:32.533 --> 41:35.797
Dr. Glassman saved
over 4,000 lives.

41:35.841 --> 41:37.451
He would say less,
but I give him credit

41:37.495 --> 41:38.887
for all the lives
that I have saved,

41:38.931 --> 41:40.585
because he taught me

41:42.021 --> 41:43.457
a mnemonic for remembering

41:43.501 --> 41:44.502
the effects
of organophosphate poisoning,

41:44.545 --> 41:45.807
and he taught me that

41:45.851 --> 41:48.027
if you just palm grip
the needle driver,

41:48.070 --> 41:50.333
you will get
way more maneuverability,
and force control.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.510
And he taught me...

41:55.034 --> 41:56.514
that when you touch one life,

41:57.732 --> 41:58.951
you don't just touch one life.

42:01.475 --> 42:03.390
You touch every life
that that life touches.

42:10.832 --> 42:15.010
Dr. Glassman said
many wise things. Yes.

42:15.054 --> 42:16.708
And over the years, I have
tried to write them down.

42:24.977 --> 42:27.370
"Think about
what people can do,

42:27.414 --> 42:28.676
not about
what people can't do."

42:31.287 --> 42:33.202
"Hear what I have to say,

42:34.421 --> 42:36.597
and then decide
if it's bad advice."

42:38.468 --> 42:40.253
"Questions are good."

42:40.296 --> 42:42.777
"Leads to awareness
and understanding."

42:42.821 --> 42:45.563
"And, who knows,
maybe even acceptance."

42:52.047 --> 42:55.224
And when he wanted the board
to hire me, he said,

42:57.531 --> 43:00.621
"We will be a better hospital
for hiring him."

43:00.665 --> 43:03.406
"We will be better people
for hiring him."

43:05.234 --> 43:07.541
And then he slammed
the desk with his hand,

43:07.585 --> 43:09.108
because that is
how you communicate

43:16.028 --> 43:17.812
that they might
take lessons from him.

43:17.856 --> 43:20.249
And if they did,

43:21.337 --> 43:23.296
he always wanted
that lesson to be...
