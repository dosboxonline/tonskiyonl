WEBVTT

01:02.020 --> 01:06.024
THE GLORY

01:06.608 --> 01:08.568
<i>You stupid fucking bitch!</i>

01:08.568 --> 01:10.737
<i>You should've just quietly dropped out.</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:13.656
<i>You're so innocent?
You didn't do anything wrong?</i>

01:13.656 --> 01:16.576
<i>Only someone as messed up as you
would lie like this.</i>

01:16.576 --> 01:19.079
<i>Come back and change
your reason for leaving, right now!</i>

01:56.157 --> 01:57.325
PARK YEON-JIN

01:57.325 --> 01:58.576
<i>Yeon-jin!</i>

01:59.744 --> 02:03.248
Do you remember
what happened on that roof?

02:04.415 --> 02:05.416
You remember?

02:06.876 --> 02:10.255
That was when your nametag
went missing, right?

02:10.255 --> 02:11.339
Remember, Yeon-jin?

02:11.339 --> 02:12.507
The fuck is this?

02:13.550 --> 02:15.844
That's enough.
Stay away from me!

02:42.620 --> 02:45.456
What... What are you doing here?

02:48.334 --> 02:50.378
You're dead. You shouldn't be here.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.465
I knew I smelled something rotten in here.

02:55.049 --> 02:58.928
All those burns on your body,
and your skull has been crushed.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.223
Why're haven't you moved on yet?

03:02.223 --> 03:05.393
What do you want?
Why are you still among the living? Huh?

03:15.236 --> 03:16.696
Oh! Mother!

03:17.989 --> 03:19.866
Mother! Mother...

03:24.204 --> 03:25.496
They're here?

03:26.623 --> 03:27.457
She's...

03:28.625 --> 03:30.126
She's here, right now!

03:36.799 --> 03:38.551
Mother! Mother?!

03:43.223 --> 03:45.099
Beoljeon! Mother's been cursed!

03:45.099 --> 03:47.310
BEOLJEON: GOD'S DEADLIEST PUNISHMENT
IN KOREAN SHAMANISM

04:34.857 --> 04:40.113
THE GLORY

05:00.341 --> 05:02.051
I hear your husband's dead.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.973
So are you working with Dong-eun?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.810
You had to drag my mom
into your husband's murder?

05:11.394 --> 05:13.479
This makes you a killer too, bitch!

05:15.315 --> 05:18.151
I guess this is why you didn't even flinch
when I offered to kill him.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.903
You need to settle this.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.407
Do you really think
I can't find your daughter?

05:26.617 --> 05:30.538
First, I have something
I need to give back to you.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.258
You fucking bitch!

05:42.258 --> 05:44.469
How can you threaten someone else's child?

05:45.136 --> 05:45.970
You're a mother too.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.683
I have a lot of pictures
you don't want other people to see.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.062
So don't try to mess with me.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.734
Hurt me again,
I'll find you and give it back to you,

05:59.734 --> 06:01.778
only twice as hard.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.491
I'll kill you, bitch!

06:17.085 --> 06:17.919
Do-yeong.

06:25.718 --> 06:26.677
Thank you, sir.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.056
Feel free to call
if there's anything else you need.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.475
You work for Mr. Shin, right?

06:32.475 --> 06:34.477
I heard he's leaving Korea soon.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.605
He's even arranged
to sell that motel in his sister's name.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.609
Okay. Let's go.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.362
What are you doing?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.452
Who's that? Do you know them?

06:53.955 --> 06:55.540
Right now, you have two choices.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.169
This is the address
of Yoon So-hee's mother.

07:01.045 --> 07:04.298
Maybe you forgot about her,
but she hasn't.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.594
Either go there
and accept your punishment, or...

07:11.597 --> 07:12.849
our marriage ends here.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.853
Think hard.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.356
I know I will.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.236
Why should I have to go?

07:26.487 --> 07:28.322
I'm not the one who killed her.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.992
That bitch just freaked out for no reason.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.035
- She slipped
- You were there...

07:36.038 --> 07:37.206
...weren't you?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.588
2941 SUNGHAN-RO, JONGNO-GU

07:48.509 --> 07:49.427
"Our marriage"?

07:50.928 --> 07:53.347
Our marriage was over the moment you...

07:56.142 --> 07:57.226
met with Dong-eun.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.274
I see.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.447
Goodbye.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.617
I've made my decision.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.123
Mr. Choi, do it.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.801
DID PARK'S HUSBAND CUT HER OFF
OVER THE BULLYING SCANDAL?

08:30.801 --> 08:32.428
PARK YEON-JIN'S TEN-YEAR MARRIAGE ENDS

08:32.428 --> 08:33.846
WEATHERCASTER DIVORCED BY CHAEBOL FAMILY

08:33.846 --> 08:35.056
HA DO-YEONG FILES FOR DIVORCE

08:36.933 --> 08:38.768
PARK YEON-JIN

08:55.284 --> 08:57.787
"However,
Jaepyeong Construction has stated

08:57.787 --> 09:01.332
that it cannot confirm
if the accusations against Park Yeon-jin

09:01.332 --> 09:05.127
are the main reason
why the two are now getting a divorce."

09:05.127 --> 09:08.839
"They do not plan on making
an announcement anytime in the future."

09:10.841 --> 09:12.677
I guess this means he's single now.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.596
Ugh. Bad news for me.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.182
Why would you care
about something like that?

09:18.933 --> 09:21.852
Didn't you say I'd lose
my parental rights if this happens?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.523
Don't you know his company's lawyer?

09:26.274 --> 09:29.026
Go meet with him. Find out what you can.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.949
Why are they getting divorced?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.953
You think Jae-jun still loves Yeon-jin?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.580
They won't get back together, right?

09:41.080 --> 09:44.500
Jae-jun said that he cums super quick
when he sleeps with me.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.919
Does that mean he's in love with me?

09:46.919 --> 09:49.672
That's premature ejaculation.
Now fuck off!

09:52.383 --> 09:55.303
I'm here doing you a favor
buying your clothes.

09:56.679 --> 10:01.475
Oh, are you going to Myeong-o's funeral?
How much condolence money do I give?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.227
Come on, what the fuck?

10:03.227 --> 10:06.147
Hey! Do I look like the FSS?

10:06.147 --> 10:08.524
Why are you asking me
about condolence money?

10:08.524 --> 10:12.528
Huh? Now Myeong-o's gone,
it's so fucking obvious.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.322
It wasn't him.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.158
The biggest idiot is you.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.076
Fuck you, Sa-ra!

10:19.076 --> 10:22.788
You think that "fuck" is the only way
to insult someone? You're wrong.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.625
Humiliating someone is worse.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.086
If it hadn't been Dong-eun,
it would've been you.

10:29.086 --> 10:32.715
You are nothing more
than a cheap plaything, understand?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.596
I came over here to help you,
but never mind.

10:40.848 --> 10:41.682
Don't regret this.

10:42.975 --> 10:43.976
Actually,

10:44.810 --> 10:46.979
I hope you do regret it,
you fucking junkie.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.939
Get lost, you fucking idiot.

11:25.059 --> 11:28.312
We didn't go to the Philippines
and eat mangos on the beach,

11:30.314 --> 11:33.693
but we still managed to get to the ocean.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.615
I'm wearing the clothes
you picked out for me.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.409
Like them?

11:42.618 --> 11:43.619
Look good?

11:47.665 --> 11:49.667
Sun-a isn't your problem now,

11:51.919 --> 11:53.587
and you don't have to forgive me.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.508
I hope you rot in this ocean

11:59.427 --> 12:00.845
for a very long time.

12:02.012 --> 12:02.847
Bastard.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.949
Ms. Kang Hyeon-nam?

12:23.743 --> 12:26.120
You're Mr. Lee Seok-jae's
next of kin, right?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.956
I represent the driver
involved in the case.

12:28.956 --> 12:32.585
The driver came here herself,
in order to reach a form of settlement.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.965
There won't be a settlement.
I'm not settling.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.759
Ma'am, please reconsider.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.678
Since the road was so wet,
the driver couldn't see him coming.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.763
Please, ma'am.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.767
My goodness, I can't imagine how you feel.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.519
I know that I have no right to be here,

12:51.604 --> 12:55.816
but you see, I have
a daughter and a granddaughter.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.736
Please, I beg you to reconsider settling.

12:59.236 --> 13:03.324
Maybe after you've taken some time,
we can meet and talk about this.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.163
I'm not going to settle.
Don't contact me again.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.791
I'm still in mourning, you know.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.418
Wait, please ma'am. Ma'am, just...

13:18.756 --> 13:20.674
What now? I don't think
she'll change her mind.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.176
Why are you asking me that?

13:22.843 --> 13:25.888
You want me to go to prison?

13:27.223 --> 13:30.267
That bitch. She better settle.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.437
Laughing while she's in mourning?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.272
Wearing that ugly dress?

13:37.358 --> 13:38.359
Double the offer.

13:39.985 --> 13:40.986
Double the money.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.833
Come on, move! You're blocking my way!

13:54.708 --> 13:58.379
Good evening, ma'am.
I'm Moon Dong-eun. I doubt you remember.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.505
You're who?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.590
Why don't we try this again?

14:02.424 --> 14:05.344
I knew Lee Seok-jae, and I know
you hired someone to have him killed.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.774
Did Yeong-jun send you?

14:18.774 --> 14:21.360
He didn't. I came on my own.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.865
I'm here all the way from the year 2004.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.494
Moon Dong-eun?

14:32.454 --> 14:35.374
Write your name here
if you agree, and then...

14:35.374 --> 14:36.333
SETTLEMENT LETTER

14:37.501 --> 14:38.377
Wait, are you really...

14:39.336 --> 14:40.170
Yeah.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.716
It seems like you remember me now,
so I'll get to the point.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.636
I don't care if you actually had
Lee Seok-jae killed or not.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.930
What I do care about is

14:49.930 --> 14:52.182
Park Yeon-jin murdered Yoon So-hee,

14:52.766 --> 14:54.977
and how Shin Yeong-jun
cleaned up after her.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.271
What?

14:57.271 --> 14:58.981
You have Yeon-jn's nametag, don't you?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.817
I know you kept it at the shaman's shrine.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.487
All I want is for you
to turn it in as evidence.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.451
So what will it be then?

15:11.285 --> 15:13.662
Will you give up
Yeon-jin to save your own skin?

15:18.667 --> 15:19.960
That's my phone number.

15:21.962 --> 15:26.759
Will you become a murderer,
or will you turn over the nametag

15:26.759 --> 15:28.928
and you'll only be charged
with manslaughter?

15:30.387 --> 15:32.264
I know this decision is easy for you,

15:33.057 --> 15:35.559
but you can pretend to think about it

15:36.936 --> 15:39.813
as if you actually loved your daughter.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.568
Call me when you've made up your mind.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.749
"Following last week's cold snap,

15:58.749 --> 16:02.336
an emergency temperature warning
has been issued across the country."

16:08.926 --> 16:12.763
"This morning promises to be freezing,
with temperatures around -10 degrees."

16:14.223 --> 16:17.601
It's -10 degrees outside,
but you still remain hot, Yeon-jin.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.563
So? My divorce?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.400
Can't you look it up at home
on your own time?

16:24.900 --> 16:27.152
Seriously, that article's
yesterday's news.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.114
Not the article, the video.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.950
You know,
the one that was posted just now.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.919
<i>...Deaf like your mother?</i>

16:44.420 --> 16:47.089
<i>Don't make me repeat myself.
Take your clothes off!</i>

16:47.589 --> 16:49.174
<i>I'm gonna kill that bitch.</i>

16:49.174 --> 16:52.803
-<i>Oh my God, she's so mad.
- Get that out of my face!</i>

17:02.229 --> 17:05.482
I told you that I'd bring you down.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.860
Have a nice day.

17:08.485 --> 17:09.987
Fucking bitch.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.323
UPLOADING VIDEO

17:13.323 --> 17:17.536
Didn't that post exposing Yeon-jin
say she killed someone she was bullying?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.538
Maybe all those articles are true.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.914
Park Yeon-jin!

17:21.707 --> 17:24.960
What is going on?
Where do these rumors keep coming from?

17:24.960 --> 17:27.379
Bullying and murder? What is this?

17:27.379 --> 17:28.547
Is it true?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.302
Why is my life

17:34.762 --> 17:36.388
so fucking hard?

17:50.652 --> 17:51.612
Here you go, sir.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.739
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

17:53.739 --> 17:55.783
I did used to be a bully,

17:57.367 --> 17:58.952
but I never killed anyone.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.300
<i>It looks like you're standing
on nothing more than ruins now...</i>

18:13.926 --> 18:16.595
<i>No longer with your
beautiful walls, Yeon-jin.</i>

18:18.305 --> 18:21.475
<i>It'll be desolate. It'll be dark.</i>

18:23.227 --> 18:25.395
<i>Welcome, Yeon-jin.</i>

18:29.650 --> 18:32.402
Take these away.
Make sure Ye-sol doesn't go online.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.362
Yes, ma'am.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.490
Puppy!

18:37.991 --> 18:41.912
Listen, Mom and Dad got into a tiny fight.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.416
And there are some things
Mommy needs to go take care of.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.584
I already saw everything.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.754
Did you bully your friend?

18:50.754 --> 18:52.506
You really burned her?

18:54.341 --> 18:56.051
Seung-a says she's scared of me.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.804
She asked if I was going to bully her too.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.350
That's not... No, please, Ye-sol.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.686
I can meet Seung-a's mother, and we can...

19:07.271 --> 19:08.355
Just go away.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.441
I don't want to be a weathercaster
when I grow up.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.986
Mommy, I'm not proud of you anymore.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.784
I admit that I was a bully

19:20.784 --> 19:23.162
when I was young and still immature.

19:23.954 --> 19:28.458
But I have never murdered anyone.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.836
In reality, I'm the real victim.

19:32.087 --> 19:36.383
For the last few years,
I've suffered at the hands of her family.

19:37.217 --> 19:41.722
I had to endure all this
just because their child died.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.057
But I've filed a lawsuit

19:44.057 --> 19:48.478
regarding these unjust accusations
made by her family members

19:49.313 --> 19:50.981
and the malicious lies spread about me.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.693
I never wanted

19:56.320 --> 19:58.071
to bring attention to any of this

20:01.074 --> 20:03.577
because we used to be very good friends,

20:05.245 --> 20:06.246
but when she died,

20:07.873 --> 20:09.708
Yoon So-hee was expecting a child.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.630
- Ms. Park, is that really true?
- Can you prove that, Ms. Park?

20:15.589 --> 20:19.092
You can check for yourselves.
It's all there in the police report.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.303
My friend, instead of having that baby,

20:22.012 --> 20:23.639
chose to kill herself.

20:25.933 --> 20:31.104
I didn't say anything about this earlier
because I wanted to keep her... her secret.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.737
I truly am sorry
I have to reveal the truth like this.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.324
That's all I have to say.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.786
Now excuse me.
I have another friend's funeral to attend.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.293
Follow Yeon-jin.
I'll look into the report.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.212
If true,
I feel bad for Yeon-jin.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.757
Are you sure? Okay, I'll call you later.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.638
Yeon-jin held a press conference.
She's heading to Myeong-o's funeral.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.139
Find out where it's being held.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.475
You still haven't heard?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.978
From the National Forensic Service?
No, not yet.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.652
What's with you two?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.070
You two fight?

21:20.070 --> 21:22.489
How could I fight someone like her?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.783
I'm just a cheap plaything.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.451
Are you talking again?

21:26.451 --> 21:29.204
I can't understand half the shit you say.

21:29.204 --> 21:32.332
So shut the fuck up, you fucking bitch.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.966
I bet you feel pretty shitty right now,

21:40.966 --> 21:43.051
especially after that video of Yeon-jin

21:43.051 --> 21:45.137
made her look even better.

21:45.137 --> 21:49.599
But I think you're going to miss
all of this, Sa-ra.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.768
What the hell are you saying?

21:55.772 --> 21:57.858
SON OF A BITCH SENT A VIDEO

21:57.858 --> 21:59.693
I just got a text from a ghost.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.278
It's from Myeong-o.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.614
What the fuck?

22:23.216 --> 22:24.134
What is this?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.303
You putting on a show?

22:27.387 --> 22:28.889
Holy shit!

22:29.389 --> 22:30.891
Sa-ra, isn't that you?

22:37.564 --> 22:38.565
It's not me.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.443
What's this? Who sent this?

22:41.443 --> 22:44.321
That dead fucker didn't send this,
so who did?!

22:45.155 --> 22:46.323
That's not you?

22:47.324 --> 22:49.409
Those eyes sure look like yours.

22:49.409 --> 22:50.786
Those crazy eyes.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.746
Sure you should be talking about
someone else's crazy eyes?

22:52.746 --> 22:55.540
What the hell are you
so excited about? It's not me!

22:55.540 --> 22:57.084
Turn it off, you bitch!

22:57.084 --> 22:58.418
This is so funny.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.254
You laughed while I was being screwed,

23:01.254 --> 23:04.007
and now that it's about you,
it's not so funny?

23:05.133 --> 23:06.802
-<i>More...</i>
- This is you.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.470
But who's the guy?

23:10.972 --> 23:12.099
<i>Hey, Sa-ra.</i>

23:15.102 --> 23:16.603
What the fuck did you say?

23:16.603 --> 23:18.105
<i>Ah, that's right.</i>

23:18.980 --> 23:23.610
<i>You probably wouldn't remember, would you?
Down on all fours like a bitch.</i>

23:23.610 --> 23:25.695
<i>- I told you, look at me.</i>
- It's Myeong-o!

23:25.695 --> 23:27.697
Did you sleep with him?

23:27.697 --> 23:29.533
Wow, Myeong-o.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.619
Guess drugs weren't
the only thing you've been taking.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.329
That isn't me!

23:34.329 --> 23:35.705
Who did this?

23:35.705 --> 23:37.290
Who sent that shit?!

23:38.500 --> 23:39.334
Why'd you do that?

23:39.334 --> 23:41.461
You're the one who slept with him,
you fucking slut!

23:41.461 --> 23:42.838
Fuck you.

23:43.588 --> 23:44.589
Sa-ra.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.592
We need to talk.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.595
Did you send it?

23:50.595 --> 23:52.180
What do you mean?

23:52.889 --> 23:53.974
Step outside with me.

23:54.724 --> 23:58.687
I think we should talk
about that video you posted.

24:00.021 --> 24:00.856
I knew.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.108
I knew it was you.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.695
Why? Trying to hide your videos
with one of mine?

24:08.738 --> 24:10.323
Hey, are you insane?

24:10.323 --> 24:11.783
Are you on drugs?

24:12.325 --> 24:13.910
Let go! Let go of me!

24:16.329 --> 24:18.290
You two act like
you're better than everyone.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.042
But posting a video of your best friend,

24:21.042 --> 24:23.753
and revealing that girl's pregnancy
to hide from your shame...

24:23.753 --> 24:26.548
Wow, you two really are fucking classy.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.757
She said what?

24:27.757 --> 24:30.093
It was you.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.555
Where are you going, you slut?

24:35.515 --> 24:37.100
I'm going to your daddy's church, bitch.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.645
Come by and see
your little film play in the lobby.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.981
Looks like you're gonna be
brought down on camera.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.234
You should've just let me buy
your fucking clothes.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.404
Unbelievable.

24:55.118 --> 24:58.413
Only the devil rejoices
at the pain of others.

24:59.456 --> 25:02.125
A bitch like you who enjoys others' pain

25:02.125 --> 25:04.085
should face judgment.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.602
Police! Move now!

25:20.602 --> 25:22.062
Wait, don't take it out!

25:23.063 --> 25:24.606
Let go! Fuck!

25:25.232 --> 25:26.316
You want my clothes so much?

25:27.025 --> 25:30.278
Then you can wear them
at your funeral! Fuck you, bitch!

25:32.322 --> 25:34.407
DECEASED: SON MYEONG-O (MALE/37)

25:50.507 --> 25:52.801
JOO YEO-JEONG PLASTIC SURGERY
DIRECTOR JOO YEO-JEONG

25:58.640 --> 26:01.351
It's been a long time
since I gave this to you.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.479
You aren't here for treatment, are you?

26:04.479 --> 26:06.565
I didn't hurt you that night, did I?

26:07.274 --> 26:11.069
Ah, by the way, how's your friend doing?
Feeling better? Hye-jeong, right?

26:11.069 --> 26:12.571
Of course you knew that.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.365
You and Dong-eun are working together.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.996
Hye-jeong went to a big hospital in Seoul.
Don't worry about her.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.041
What exactly is going on
between you and Dong-eun?

26:25.834 --> 26:26.918
You fucking?

26:28.461 --> 26:29.963
You should watch what you say.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.757
I've gotten used to my new car,

26:32.757 --> 26:34.676
so I might actually
run you over this time.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.761
Oh, your manners are fucking terrible.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.264
Probably 'cause you grew up rich.

26:39.264 --> 26:42.851
Anyways, your mom's the director
at Joo General, right?

26:43.893 --> 26:45.145
I heard So-hee's there.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.398
She has been for a while.

26:49.774 --> 26:50.609
Why do you care?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.777
I was wondering if I could go see her.

26:53.987 --> 26:54.988
She's frozen, right?

26:55.947 --> 26:58.783
Will they perform an autopsy?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.995
As a doctor, what do you think?

27:01.995 --> 27:03.288
If one was performed,

27:05.206 --> 27:07.834
would they test
everything they find inside her?

27:11.963 --> 27:14.549
Yoon So-hee was pregnant when she died.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.886
I don't know a lot about forensics,

27:17.886 --> 27:21.139
but I do know you need to be accompanied
by a member of Ms. Yoon's family.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.475
If you're looking to book
a procedure with me,

27:23.475 --> 27:25.352
you can make an appointment
on your way out.

27:26.561 --> 27:30.148
I have a lot of patients I need to see
before I go out of town tomorrow.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.609
Wow, you almost convinced me
to book an appointment with you.

27:33.860 --> 27:34.861
I'm good, Doctor.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.791
Sir, excuse me.

27:47.791 --> 27:51.461
Uh, Mr. Jeon didn't pay
before he took off.

27:52.045 --> 27:55.215
Don't worry, it's fine.
He already paid me with something else.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.132
You can go.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.217
Oh.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.434
SUDDEN INCREASE IN INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE
WHEN TAKING STEROID EYE DROPS

28:06.434 --> 28:07.602
GLAUCOMA MONITORING REQUIRED

28:18.822 --> 28:20.240
Myeong-o wasn't the father.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.618
The asshole that deserves to die

28:24.119 --> 28:25.120
<i>was Jeon Jae-jun.</i>

28:30.333 --> 28:31.918
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

28:31.918 --> 28:33.169
<i>I didn't know.</i>

28:33.878 --> 28:35.255
<i>How did I miss that?</i>

28:37.048 --> 28:39.551
He wasn't just
playing basketball after all.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.521
Do you know what time it is?

28:51.521 --> 28:53.857
You told me to hurry, that it was ur...

28:58.653 --> 28:59.738
Hello.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.489
She's a member of the club.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.951
She loves the dumplings
we sell in our cafe.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.122
Ah...

29:09.122 --> 29:11.583
I was planning on giving you a call soon.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.835
Did you see that article?

29:13.835 --> 29:16.129
Ye-sol's dad and I
got into a small disagreement.

29:16.129 --> 29:20.383
Still, asking for a divorce seems
a little hasty, don't you think, ma'am?

29:20.383 --> 29:21.634
Ye-sol's dad, huh?

29:22.802 --> 29:23.970
Ye-sol's father?

29:31.060 --> 29:33.438
Hey now,
why'd you pick the putter?

29:34.439 --> 29:37.567
- You know this one hurts the most.
- Stay out of this, Mr. Jeon.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.320
Who is it? Who's the father?

29:41.905 --> 29:45.825
Mr. Jeon told me that Ye-sol isn't...

29:45.825 --> 29:47.744
She isn't Do-yeong's child.

29:50.538 --> 29:51.790
You insane?

29:53.249 --> 29:55.376
Ah, I forgot to mention that.

30:00.673 --> 30:01.925
I'm the one you're looking for.

30:02.592 --> 30:03.676
Ye-sol's my daughter.

30:07.931 --> 30:08.765
What did you say?

30:08.765 --> 30:14.646
So, it doesn't make sense for your son
to raise my daughter, does it?

30:15.355 --> 30:16.523
Now you know the truth,

30:18.233 --> 30:21.903
would you please consider
disowning Ye-sol?

30:22.487 --> 30:24.614
You fucking asshole!

30:29.661 --> 30:31.246
You two brats

30:31.830 --> 30:33.998
have made a terrible mistake.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.210
How dare you betray my son like that?!

30:40.129 --> 30:41.840
How dare you?

30:42.423 --> 30:44.634
How dare you? How dare you?

30:51.266 --> 30:52.517
Yoon So-hee?

30:52.517 --> 30:56.604
Yes. I'd like to pay her morgue fee.
I know it's been overdue since 2004.

30:56.604 --> 30:58.189
Ah, yes.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.734
I guess you could say
you're a little too late.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.486
That was paid off some time ago.

31:05.905 --> 31:06.739
By who?

31:07.824 --> 31:10.159
Jaepyeong Construction's CEO, Ha Do-yeong.

31:10.994 --> 31:11.828
Ah.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.665
Thank you, sir.

31:24.090 --> 31:28.177
Maybe this is why Dr. Joo wanted
to preserve her body all these years.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.284
Are you going on a business trip, sir?

31:53.870 --> 31:54.871
One moment.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.414
MOTHER

32:02.879 --> 32:04.964
Thank you for taking care of my daughter.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.717
We no longer need your help.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.020
Ye-sol!

32:20.313 --> 32:21.439
Ye-sol!

32:24.400 --> 32:25.318
Ye-sol!

32:33.868 --> 32:34.869
Give me a hug.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.041
Daddy!

32:46.631 --> 32:49.050
Daddy, I'm sorry.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.265
My princess,
you have nothing to be sorry for.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.813
Nothing that's happening right now
is because of you.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.565
This isn't your fault.

33:05.441 --> 33:06.693
Do you understand me?

33:07.402 --> 33:09.153
Daddy.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.046
I have a favor to ask.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.549
Give this to Seong-hee.

33:30.049 --> 33:33.344
And this, would you please give
to the school nurse?

33:33.845 --> 33:35.930
I put a note for them in the bag.

33:38.224 --> 33:39.225
So this...

33:40.518 --> 33:42.979
is really my last mission.

33:45.398 --> 33:46.232
Yes.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.485
Thank you for all you've done.

33:51.946 --> 33:55.116
Go live the life you've always wanted.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.200
You're free now.

33:57.326 --> 34:00.747
Live in a world where you don't
have to be my accomplice.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.542
You can be who you want to be.
Live a happy life.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.769
You brought eggs, didn't you?

34:31.778 --> 34:32.945
Please don't cry.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.199
I wanna leave you with a smile.

34:44.540 --> 34:48.753
Sometimes, I wonder what you were like

34:50.046 --> 34:51.714
when you were still a young girl.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.970
'Cause you're so pretty when you smile.

35:02.225 --> 35:03.142
Do you?

35:06.813 --> 35:08.397
How I used to be?

35:11.400 --> 35:12.568
I don't remember.

35:25.998 --> 35:26.999
I would like

35:28.167 --> 35:30.169
to wish you luck, Ms. Moon.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.631
Thank you.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.427
I hope we never meet again.

36:24.473 --> 36:25.308
Gyeong-ran.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.227
- Hey. Have you eaten?
- Uh-huh.

36:28.227 --> 36:31.230
- Wow, it's hot.
- Let's get food after school.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.274
- We can get fries.
- Sure, sounds good.

38:17.336 --> 38:18.170
NO LAUNDRY

38:28.681 --> 38:31.517
You really shouldn't
be doing laundry in here.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.354
Work here?

38:37.565 --> 38:38.983
You're good at your job.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.494
She owns the place down the road.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.789
Her son just died. Hit by a drunk driver.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.125
She's having a hard time.

38:57.626 --> 38:58.627
Let her be.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.013
Anyway, welcome.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.515
<i>Dong-eun told me
you saved her life.</i>

39:15.519 --> 39:16.520
Oh.

39:35.998 --> 39:38.042
Let's watch how that scar
on her neck heals.

39:38.042 --> 39:41.754
And her voice,
keep an eye on that as well.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.173
What do you mean, keep an eye on her?

39:44.965 --> 39:47.343
So, will she get her voice back or not?

39:48.010 --> 39:51.722
Her vocal cords were seriously injured,
so it's impossible to control them.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.974
As of now, probably not,

39:53.974 --> 39:56.519
but sometimes patients do get
their voices back.

39:56.519 --> 39:57.853
HOW OFTEN IS "SOMETIMES"?

39:58.437 --> 40:00.022
What are her chances, Doctor?

40:00.022 --> 40:01.899
It's not very likely, but it could.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.902
Ms. Choi, please,
it's important you don't speak.

40:10.699 --> 40:11.534
Shit.

40:12.368 --> 40:13.869
If you're going to need a miracle,

40:14.954 --> 40:17.623
I guess I should just send your stuff.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.877
I don't have to worry about you.
You're brave.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.338
Let me know if you need anything.

40:24.338 --> 40:26.424
That's right. You can't talk.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.928
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!

40:30.928 --> 40:33.597
Hey, the doctor said you shouldn't talk.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.851
What? You're saying I can't do this?

40:37.977 --> 40:39.061
Why?

40:39.061 --> 40:39.979
Ah.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.022
That recording.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.068
I erased everything.

40:47.027 --> 40:49.238
Remember? Three 69s.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.950
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

40:52.950 --> 40:55.369
I know I am a son of a bitch.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.622
Don't try to speak. Doctor's orders.

40:59.331 --> 41:01.667
Hey, you should switch to menthol.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.003
That should loosen up your throat.

41:06.797 --> 41:10.050
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! I'LL KILL YOU!

41:17.766 --> 41:20.936
<i>Ms. Lee will face trial
for special damages and attempted murder.</i>

41:20.936 --> 41:25.733
<i>Pastor Lee Gil-seong, Ms. Lee's father,
has also been arrested for tax evasion.</i>

41:26.233 --> 41:29.403
<i>The church offerings that he has been
embezzling from for over 20 years</i>

41:29.403 --> 41:31.906
<i>are estimated to be worth
tens of billions.</i>

41:32.615 --> 41:34.116
I saw the news.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.535
Looks like we're almost there.

41:37.119 --> 41:39.371
<i>Congratulations. You've destroyed them.</i>

41:39.371 --> 41:41.040
I may have set up the board,

41:41.040 --> 41:43.417
but they're the ones
who destroyed themselves.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.628
Besides, you're the one who finished this.

41:46.712 --> 41:49.048
Finally, everything is in place.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.183
Turn around. You shouldn't see this.

41:59.975 --> 42:02.937
You should be looking
at only beautiful things.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.149
No, I should watch.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.444
My executioner is
wielding his sword for me.

42:13.072 --> 42:13.989
Milady.

42:50.859 --> 42:51.777
Sir.

42:52.278 --> 42:54.613
The DNA results from under
Son Myeong-o's fingernails are in.

42:55.197 --> 42:56.407
They're a little weird.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.243
Why's it so weird?

42:59.243 --> 43:01.870
Remember the lighter
they found at the scene 18 years ago?

43:01.870 --> 43:02.788
DNA TEST RESULTS

43:02.788 --> 43:07.084
The DNA from the lighter matched
the DNA under Myeong-o's fingernails.

43:07.876 --> 43:08.836
How?

43:09.545 --> 43:12.965
Get DNA samples from everyone.
We need it done ASAP.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.133
Yeah.

43:14.967 --> 43:17.261
I would like to thank Dr. Joo Yeo-jeong.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.184
I'll be home late tonight.
I'm heading out of town right now.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.520
Where're you going?

43:27.813 --> 43:29.273
<i>To Dr. Joo Yeo-jeong.</i>

43:30.357 --> 43:32.568
Um, somewhere far.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.903
I gotta go. See you later.

43:37.990 --> 43:40.743
<i>Hello, Dr. Joo.
This is Kang Yeong-cheon.</i>

43:43.203 --> 43:46.707
<i>I can't even pretend to comprehend
the grief of losing a family member,</i>

43:47.583 --> 43:49.710
<i>But allow me to express my condolences.</i>

43:51.128 --> 43:53.047
<i>Although we only met for a short time,</i>

43:54.089 --> 43:57.092
<i>I still remember your father
as a very good man.</i>

43:59.428 --> 44:03.766
<i>He did all he could to treat me,
despite the fact that I am a murderer.</i>

44:04.308 --> 44:05.726
3724, visitor!

44:13.984 --> 44:14.902
We meet again.

44:17.571 --> 44:20.282
You didn't answer my question
the last time I was here.

44:21.075 --> 44:23.494
You promised to show me
the hell you're living in

44:23.494 --> 44:25.204
if we were to meet again.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.291
You still haven't told me

44:31.043 --> 44:32.711
why you did what you did.

44:34.963 --> 44:36.048
So tell me now.

44:44.890 --> 44:46.975
Do you think this is your hell, Dr. Joo?

44:51.146 --> 44:52.481
It's far from over.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.321
Why did you...

45:02.074 --> 45:03.575
have to kill my dad?

45:11.333 --> 45:13.335
Everyone there refused to operate on me.

45:14.753 --> 45:17.589
My arm was broken and the pain
was so intense, I thought I'd die.

45:18.590 --> 45:22.970
I was bleeding badly,
but no one would come anywhere near me.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.973
That's when your father stepped in.

45:33.605 --> 45:35.607
Step aside, people.
Everybody move.

45:40.946 --> 45:42.197
I'll do it.

45:42.197 --> 45:44.032
Get him an IV and a CT.

45:44.032 --> 45:46.535
Get those off him.
I can't treat him with those on.

45:46.535 --> 45:49.830
Dr. Joo, please, we can't do it.
Send him somewhere else.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.957
And that hospital? And their doctors?

45:52.916 --> 45:55.002
The court will punish him for his crimes.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.129
We're here to make sure
he can go to trial.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.674
Can someone call Yeo-jeong for me?

46:01.467 --> 46:03.802
We were supposed to meet
for dinner tonight.

46:03.802 --> 46:06.597
But tell him to go and not to eat ramen.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.641
I don't get
why he's always eating that stuff.

46:17.566 --> 46:20.986
I was dying and he wanted to make sure
his son wasn't eating ramen.

46:20.986 --> 46:24.031
It's kinda hilarious
if you really think about it, right?

46:25.783 --> 46:27.493
Anyway, the operation began,

46:27.493 --> 46:30.037
and in the middle of it
I woke up, and yeah...

46:30.537 --> 46:31.830
One of my arms was free

46:32.748 --> 46:34.374
and the scalpel was close.

46:40.923 --> 46:43.342
Do you know
who I wanted to see at that moment?

46:46.762 --> 46:47.679
Yeah.

46:48.305 --> 46:50.808
The director's son who really loves ramen.

46:50.808 --> 46:51.809
That's my reason why.

46:53.852 --> 46:56.438
I thought you'd come
if your father were to die.

46:57.356 --> 46:59.483
I wanted you to come running
so I took the scalpel and...

47:05.697 --> 47:07.866
<i>I would like
to honor my late father</i>

47:07.866 --> 47:10.285
and offer you my professional services.

47:11.161 --> 47:14.998
My father always said
if you choose the medical profession,

47:14.998 --> 47:19.044
you should think of the care for others
as a doctor's true mission and calling.

47:19.795 --> 47:22.881
I think a healthy body is
the foundation of law and order,

47:22.881 --> 47:25.509
and the beginning of hope
for a brighter tomorrow.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.432
<i>While I admire
your intention, Dr. Joo,</i>

47:32.432 --> 47:34.560
<i>I just can't hire
the family member of a victim.</i>

47:37.354 --> 47:39.940
So in reality,
you were the one responsible

47:39.940 --> 47:41.275
for killing your father.

48:35.662 --> 48:36.747
What?

48:36.747 --> 48:37.748
Mom.

48:38.624 --> 48:39.833
Hello?

48:39.833 --> 48:42.961
Hey, stranger.
You look like you've lost a little weight.

48:42.961 --> 48:46.048
I've only been eating vegetables
to fit into my bikini.

48:46.548 --> 48:48.216
But now I hear sun shirts are in.

48:49.885 --> 48:52.137
There goes your chance
for a European stepdad.

48:52.137 --> 48:54.932
From where?
Maybe an Italian stallion?

48:57.392 --> 48:58.226
Were you crying?

48:59.311 --> 49:01.188
Why would I?
I've got nothing to cry about.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.649
Can you buy me dinner? I'm hungry.

49:03.649 --> 49:05.984
I'll grab a list of the most
expensive places in Jong-heon.

49:05.984 --> 49:07.069
I'll be right back.

49:07.736 --> 49:08.862
Go get a haircut.

49:10.072 --> 49:13.408
You need to take advantage
of that handsome face I gave you.

49:13.408 --> 49:15.202
I'm trying to grow it out
so I can braid it.

49:32.886 --> 49:35.013
Mr. Ha is currently
on leave at the moment.

49:35.013 --> 49:36.098
I know.

49:37.015 --> 49:38.350
I called him earlier.

49:39.434 --> 49:40.435
So I know.

49:41.853 --> 49:43.647
I know.

49:47.067 --> 49:49.486
But here's the last safe place I could go.

50:04.209 --> 50:07.462
<i>Still don't know?
I sent your missing nametag</i>

50:07.462 --> 50:10.507
<i>straight over to the police.</i>

50:13.176 --> 50:16.096
<i>I didn't get the chance
to use your nametag back then.</i>

50:17.055 --> 50:18.724
<i>But I found a use for it now.</i>

50:22.019 --> 50:23.020
PARK YEON-JIN

50:25.272 --> 50:27.774
Chief Shin gave it to me
after it was turned in.

50:28.608 --> 50:31.361
I've had it ever since. Are we done?

50:32.070 --> 50:34.823
Not yet. We're just getting started.

50:43.665 --> 50:44.666
Mom?

50:45.167 --> 50:46.168
Yeon-jin?

50:46.918 --> 50:47.919
Why are you...

50:49.880 --> 50:52.924
- You tell her to come here?
- Yeon-jin deserves to know.

50:55.844 --> 50:58.680
Your mother chose
to give you up to save herself.

50:59.222 --> 51:00.557
You said it yourself.

51:01.349 --> 51:03.685
Family will betray us the worst.

51:04.269 --> 51:05.270
You fucking bitch!

51:06.063 --> 51:07.439
This is for you, Yeon-jin.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.233
Back where it belongs.

51:13.862 --> 51:15.572
Want to know something?

51:16.156 --> 51:18.617
This nametag can't even
be used as evidence.

51:19.117 --> 51:23.622
It wasn't found the night So-hee died.
Her nametag was found much later.

51:26.792 --> 51:30.045
I never needed your mother's testimony.

51:31.379 --> 51:32.506
I just wanted to know

51:33.840 --> 51:36.426
if she would abandon you like mine did.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.055
Now we both know

51:41.389 --> 51:42.224
the truth.

51:42.724 --> 51:43.725
She would.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.199
Mom.

52:03.286 --> 52:04.287
What'd you do?

52:12.754 --> 52:13.922
Tell me why.

52:17.759 --> 52:20.345
How could you do this
to your own daughter?

52:20.345 --> 52:22.764
What? I should go down with you?

52:23.515 --> 52:26.518
When you're the one
who couldn't get rid of the bitch.

52:27.144 --> 52:30.730
Well, you can give your own daughter love.

52:31.690 --> 52:33.108
I don't think I can do that.

52:36.611 --> 52:37.445
Mom.

52:39.948 --> 52:42.617
Mom!

52:46.538 --> 52:48.290
Mom!

52:51.501 --> 52:54.504
<i>I know
that there are mothers out there</i>

52:55.005 --> 52:58.425
<i>who would willingly choose hell
to save their children, Yeon-jin.</i>

52:58.425 --> 53:00.010
Those crazy bitches.

53:00.010 --> 53:03.013
Doing this at someone else's funeral?
How dare they.

53:03.513 --> 53:04.514
Damn it.

54:03.281 --> 54:04.366
<i>So I hope</i>

54:05.533 --> 54:07.786
<i>you don't think this is over just yet.</i>

54:08.870 --> 54:11.539
<i>And don't assume
that you've been punished enough.</i>

54:14.125 --> 54:18.546
<i>After all, only Myeong-o got a funeral.</i>

54:21.091 --> 54:23.718
INCOMING CALL - SEONG-HEE

54:24.302 --> 54:25.303
Hey, Seong-hee.

54:26.471 --> 54:29.849
<i>Dong-eun, I'm at Sunghan-dong,
and Mrs. Kim's collapsed.</i>

54:44.072 --> 54:45.865
Ms. Kim Gil-nyeo's guardian?

54:46.950 --> 54:47.951
Here.

54:51.788 --> 54:53.415
What's your relationship to the patient?

54:53.915 --> 54:56.668
I'm a friend. She doesn't have
any remaining family.

54:57.168 --> 54:58.920
I'm sorry, just give me a minute, please.

54:59.587 --> 55:00.839
You should check this out.

55:00.839 --> 55:03.633
The note on her file says
that Dr. Joo is her guardian.

55:04.175 --> 55:06.303
He's probably eating
with the director right now.

55:09.681 --> 55:12.642
Hey, it's me.
I have a question about this chart.

55:44.132 --> 55:45.675
Have you been here long?

55:50.680 --> 55:52.599
You're listed as Yoon So-hee's...

55:54.476 --> 55:56.144
mother's legal guardian.

55:58.313 --> 56:01.316
When I asked, the date on the note was

56:03.109 --> 56:05.278
before we even met each other
on that train.

56:17.665 --> 56:19.125
Did you always know

56:21.336 --> 56:22.587
that I was going to...

56:24.964 --> 56:26.466
come to you for help?
