WEBVTT

00:19.769 --> 00:22.021
I couldn't sleep.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.275
We should start taking
your blood pressure every day.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.196
This is very sweet and responsible.

00:30.780 --> 00:34.743
Yes, I am going to try
to be extra responsible now.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.661
Yeah.

00:38.913 --> 00:42.751
W-We… We have to talk
about what we… want to do.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.587
I love you.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.046
I want a child.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.506
So I want this child.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.091
I love you, too.

00:51.092 --> 00:54.471
And I do want kids, but it's complicated.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.932
Is this the right time in my career?

00:58.016 --> 00:59.851
In our relationship?

01:00.226 --> 01:01.519
Am I too young?

01:01.603 --> 01:02.604
Can we afford this?

01:02.687 --> 01:05.023
Am I willing to make
this commitment right now?

01:05.106 --> 01:06.858
We can start depositing money

01:06.941 --> 01:08.443
into a shared account for expenses,

01:08.526 --> 01:11.154
and I can talk to Dr. Glassman
about hiring you an assistant

01:11.237 --> 01:12.447
to help with your workload…

01:12.530 --> 01:13.615
Shaun, just slow down.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.159
I-I don't need you
to answer these questions now.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.453
I just need to… think.

01:18.536 --> 01:19.954
To figure out what to do.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.582
And you do, too.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.756
Dr. Chambers, I'd like you to meet
a few of our residents.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.299
-This is…
-I know that I'm old,

01:31.382 --> 01:33.426
but I can still read name tags.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.095
Dr. Chambers, you started
experiencing aches

01:36.179 --> 01:37.722
in your right hand a month ago?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.808
Then tremors, weakness, spasms.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.727
Had to drop out in the middle
of a bowel resection last Friday.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.187
I sent you a video of the surgery.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.439
Given your symptoms,
it seems that carpal tunnel…

01:46.523 --> 01:47.774
Oh, it "seems."

01:47.857 --> 01:50.568
[chuckling] Well, then, problem solved.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.237
I'll be on my way.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.322
Sir, can I just say that the documentary

01:54.405 --> 01:56.533
on your work in Haiti changed my life.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.034
It's the reason why I went into…

01:58.118 --> 02:00.620
If you want to suck up to me,
call me "doctor," not "sir."

02:00.703 --> 02:02.664
And this is a hospital, not Coachella.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.541
If you can't wear something appropriate,

02:04.624 --> 02:06.584
at least try something that fits.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.503
[sighs]

02:09.337 --> 02:10.547
[paper rustles]

02:11.005 --> 02:13.716
Rule out autoimmune disorders,
hypothyroidism,

02:13.800 --> 02:17.011
diabetes, amyloidosis, MS,
and multiple myeloma.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.597
Then we'll get back to carpal tunnel.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.685
All right. If you have
any other questions or concerns,

02:23.768 --> 02:25.061
please don't hesitate…

02:25.145 --> 02:26.187
Twelve.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.858
First, I prefer blankets
not made of sandpaper.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.152
Second, dim these damn lights.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.029
This isn't some San Fernando Valley
porn shoot.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.781
-Third…
-[Shaun] If you made a list,

02:36.865 --> 02:38.283
you don't need to tell us.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.621
He's had the pain for nine months now.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.456
-[Asher] And it's on both sides?
-Mm-hmm.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.125
Sometimes his forehead,

02:47.208 --> 02:48.751
other times his cheeks, his nose.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.421
And it's persisting through
very high doses of hydrocodone.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.132
Yeah, obviously, the drugs don't work.
It's why I'm here.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.258
[Ana] Oscar.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.968
It's a fair question.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.512
Look, I'm sorry.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.098
Okay, I've been to six doctors now.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.349
I can't work.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.019
I mean, I-I c…
I can't even kiss my wife.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.353
I can hardly smile.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.564
I'm just gonna lightly brush your cheek.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.694
[groans] Okay.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.738
[breathing heavily]

03:17.280 --> 03:19.449
Please… help me.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.289
I've been on the phone for like an hour
with the cable company…

03:26.372 --> 03:27.582
Lea's pregnant.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.467
You want to have…

03:38.176 --> 03:39.177
Yes.

03:39.677 --> 03:40.678
Wow.

03:40.762 --> 03:41.721
[chuckles]

03:42.847 --> 03:44.098
I'm glad you're happy.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.143
Um, do you have any concerns?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.311
Yes.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.438
Sleep deprivation.

03:50.521 --> 03:53.566
But I have started
looking into an affordable night nurse.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.362
Well, there's gonna be some bigger issues.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.155
I mean, this is a…

03:59.239 --> 04:00.615
[laughs]

04:00.698 --> 04:04.494
This is a gigantic moment for anyone,

04:04.577 --> 04:07.080
especially… especially for you.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.373
You mean

04:09.249 --> 04:10.458
because of my ASD?

04:10.541 --> 04:11.793
Yeah, because of your ASD.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.378
Because of your family.

04:15.755 --> 04:16.965
Your job.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.800
I mean… [chuckles]

04:18.883 --> 04:20.093
A million things.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.096
I don't want to tell you what…
what to…

04:23.179 --> 04:24.931
I mean, I don't even know what I…

04:28.017 --> 04:29.519
Having a child

04:31.771 --> 04:34.190
changes everything.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.572
[theme music playing]

04:49.580 --> 04:50.999
[whirring]

04:53.209 --> 04:55.044
[Asher] Nasal cavity's clear.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.965
There's no abscess,
facial tumor, or sinusitis.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.050
It could be acoustic neuroma.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.635
Without any hearing loss?

05:02.719 --> 05:03.970
Let's do an MRI to check.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.514
We've run eight negative tests.
We don't need a ninth.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.349
We do the tests
till we know what he has.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.809
It's fibromyalgia.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.394
So, your diagnosis for his pain

05:11.477 --> 05:13.354
is "pain that no one can explain"?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.982
-Well done.
-Some pain's unavoidable.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.692
When I was competing in Tae Kwon Do,

05:17.775 --> 05:19.944
they taught us to adjust
our relationship to it,

05:20.028 --> 05:21.070
learn to tolerate it.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.196
It can make you stronger.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.574
Wow. That statement has
the absolute ideal ratio

05:24.657 --> 05:26.784
of heartlessness,
humble-bragging, and machismo.

05:26.868 --> 05:27.744
Bravo.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.912
Seriously? You're pleased with that?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.956
"Machismo," Spanish, "bravo"'s Italian.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.750
And "humble-bragging"'s 2011.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.877
We can do better, don't you think?

05:35.960 --> 05:40.339
Maybe we're not finding anything
because it's psychological?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.842
Some kind of conversion disorder?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.386
You do the MRI.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.679
I'll talk to the wife.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.933
Negative for endocrine issues.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.395
He's got a history
of moderate carotid stenosis.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.273
If enough plaque builds up,
starves the brain of oxygen,

05:57.356 --> 05:58.858
maybe could cause the hand problems.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.611
If it got that bad, we'd have
already seen signs of a stroke.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.696
[Enrique] Anyone else annoyed
that we're wasting

06:03.780 --> 06:06.407
all these resources to confirm
what's clearly carpal tunnel?

06:06.491 --> 06:08.201
He may be a jerk,
but he's a great doctor.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.287
If Silas Chambers has a medical opinion,
we better check it out.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.705
I didn't think he was a jerk.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.419
Dr. Andrews and Dr. Lim also criticize us

06:18.503 --> 06:20.088
and have particular demands.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.215
Yeah. They want us to improve.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.634
How do you know Dr. Chambers doesn't?

06:24.717 --> 06:26.219
He did improve Enrique.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.013
Not kidding.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.515
You look snazzy.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.981
I know what Dr. Chambers has.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.151
We're having trouble finding
a physical basis

06:42.235 --> 06:43.236
for your husband's pain.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.367
And you defended me when I asked him
about painkillers earlier.

06:56.582 --> 07:00.211
A few years ago,
Oscar was on a job site.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.630
Working crazy hours.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.132
He was exhausted.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.426
He shot himself with a… with a nail gun.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.719
Right through his palm.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.556
We didn't have insurance,

07:11.639 --> 07:15.726
so we went to this clinic, and, um…

07:16.352 --> 07:17.562
Opioids?

07:18.938 --> 07:20.148
Really bad.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.192
Took a year for him to kick.

07:24.777 --> 07:29.198
Now, um… he's taking more pills than ever.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.244
Whenever I talk to him
about getting help,

07:34.036 --> 07:35.121
he just gets mad.

07:35.997 --> 07:36.831
I, uh…

07:38.749 --> 07:40.751
I had to move out last week.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.672
I'm only here because he asked me to.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.219
I think he's faking.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.556
[sighs]

07:54.557 --> 07:57.894
You threw 113 sutures
in your last day of surgery.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.813
In at least half,
I detected a very subtle tremor.

08:01.230 --> 08:04.942
Congratulations on discovering
a symptom I told you about.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.986
It occurs during the part of your stitch

08:07.069 --> 08:09.614
when the wrist is straight,
not when it's bent.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.282
That is not carpal tunnel.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.242
It is musician's dystonia.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.495
My wrist flexes on every suture.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.747
You're talking about
a difference of milliseconds.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.706
Yes, he is.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.250
Your condition was probably caused

08:21.334 --> 08:22.835
by your repetitive technique.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.546
Even Dr. Andrews
throws sutures in varied ways.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.757
You never do.
This kind of obsessive behavior

08:27.840 --> 08:29.509
is common for those with autism.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.135
So, I can refer…

08:31.219 --> 08:32.220
What did you just say?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.516
I'm not autistic.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.692
[Dr. Andrews] Dr. Murphy
didn't mean any offense.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.694
He himself is on the spectrum.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.363
Oh, is he?

08:50.446 --> 08:53.199
I thought his robotic voice
and hand clasping

08:53.282 --> 08:54.909
were just charming affectations.

08:54.992 --> 08:58.204
Do you really think
I am anything like him?

08:58.287 --> 08:59.288
I'm not saying that…

08:59.372 --> 09:00.373
I am.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.124
You're extremely organized.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.834
You hardly make eye contact.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.795
And given your problems
with food, blankets,

09:05.878 --> 09:08.798
and lighting, plus the fact
you wear headphones even in surgery,

09:08.881 --> 09:10.591
you clearly have sensory issues.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.176
I'm organized.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.804
Would you rather I show up
in the OR and just wing it?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.430
I have good taste in food and music.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.140
Now that's a mental disorder?

09:19.016 --> 09:20.851
And as for eye contact…

09:23.437 --> 09:24.438
Okay.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.149
I didn't come here for a psych consult.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.528
It was just an observation
about a possible reason

09:30.611 --> 09:32.655
for the behavior that led
to your hand symptoms,

09:32.738 --> 09:34.824
which is what we should
be talking about.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.702
Physical therapy is
the recommended course for dystonia.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.580
I'm not wasting months
on a treatment that won't work.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.915
I want an MRI-guided ultrasound ablation

09:42.999 --> 09:45.126
of the VO nucleus of the thalamus.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.631
You want to jump to brain surgery?

09:50.715 --> 09:53.050
I would jump right to amputating a toe

09:53.134 --> 09:55.136
if it got me my career back.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.185
[Dr. Andrews] What were you thinking?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.396
You just supported me.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.441
Yes, because part of my job
is not yelling at residents

10:08.524 --> 10:09.942
in front of patients.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.486
What you did is equivalent
to looking at a fuzzy MRI

10:12.570 --> 10:14.405
and blurting out a patient has cancer.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.073
Cancer can kill you.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.954
Neither diagnosis is one
a patient is excited to hear.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.416
Prep him for the ablation.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.336
And do not talk to him again
about autism.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.636
He's seen six doctors in the last month,

10:36.719 --> 10:38.179
gotten three opioid prescriptions,

10:38.262 --> 10:39.972
and he had a previous opioid problem.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.474
It's textbook drug-seeking.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.684
It's also textbook "a bunch of dingbats

10:43.768 --> 10:45.603
missing a trigeminal neuralgia diagnosis."

10:45.686 --> 10:47.647
Mm, his wife agrees with me.
She knows him.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.190
Would explain why yours left you.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.734
Snap. Except my wife didn't leave me,

10:51.817 --> 10:53.944
so neither a good point,
nor even a clever one.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.988
FIESTA imaging would
take hours to set up,

10:56.072 --> 10:58.741
cost the patient serious money,
and still come out negative.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.452
Because… it's textbook drug-seeking.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.580
We have other patients who need us.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.290
I'm sending the discharge order.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.215
Hey.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.385
[lea retching]

11:23.474 --> 11:25.101
I hate poop.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.437
Like, what if I suck at changing diapers?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.982
Maybe we should start
with the bigger issues

11:32.066 --> 11:33.734
and work our way down.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.405
This isn't at the top of my list,

11:37.488 --> 11:39.115
but since you are a doctor…

11:40.533 --> 11:42.535
Shaun's ASD… is it…?

11:42.618 --> 11:43.828
Inheritable?

11:45.996 --> 11:47.415
Probably.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.291
But it's unclear how much.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.377
So, even that.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.629
W-What am I supposed to do with that?

11:53.712 --> 11:55.214
Think it through.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.676
Let's say you have a little baby Shaun.

12:01.637 --> 12:05.057
Like… tiny, honest,

12:05.808 --> 12:08.060
brilliant guy who adores me…

12:09.186 --> 12:11.397
Mini button-down,

12:12.731 --> 12:14.150
teeny blue eyes…

12:17.319 --> 12:19.738
And me?

12:22.032 --> 12:23.325
A mom?

12:24.326 --> 12:26.328
I mean, I'm not saying
my life would be worse,

12:26.412 --> 12:27.913
but it would just be so different

12:27.997 --> 12:29.623
from what I was planning.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.208
Not that I was really planning,

12:31.292 --> 12:36.297
but I am enjoying just… being.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.133
And so what if you wait?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.261
I just want to make sure
I'm making the right decision.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.345
Mm-hmm.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.266
[sighs]

12:49.018 --> 12:51.020
I guess you'll never really know.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.775
I had to make a lot
of hard choices about my mom.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.404
And I still wake up wondering

13:00.488 --> 13:02.239
which of them went the wrong way.

13:04.408 --> 13:08.829
But…you still gotta choose.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.088
[whirring]

13:21.800 --> 13:23.761
[Asher] No abnormal signal
in the mid pons.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.681
So, are you and Dr. Park
like this at home, too?

13:27.765 --> 13:30.434
When I let him out
of his cage for meals, yes.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.352
[door opens]

13:31.435 --> 13:32.645
Hey, we're almost…

13:34.355 --> 13:35.356
[sighs]

13:37.107 --> 13:38.192
Oh, come on.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.444
Did you not get the text
I didn't send about this?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.238
Don't ask for consults if you're gonna…

13:42.321 --> 13:43.572
Wait.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.200
What's that on the right
superior cerebellar artery?

13:52.998 --> 13:55.209
An abnormal loop causing compression.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.503
He has trigeminal neuralgia.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.796
The pain's real.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.926
[Claire] We have good visualization

14:04.009 --> 14:05.302
of the target area.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.222
[Dr. Andrews] Connect the ultrasound
to the stereotactic frame.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.615
[Shaun] Ablation won't work.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.118
[Enrique] You changed your mind?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.578
You don't think he has dystonia?

14:30.661 --> 14:33.038
He does, but it's a symptom.

14:33.122 --> 14:37.209
His vertebral artery takes
an aberrant course.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.670
It is pressing against his spinal cord.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.881
He needs vascular surgery or he'll die.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.094
It's a disorder of the nerve
that carries sensation

14:47.177 --> 14:48.721
from the face to the brain.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.390
And it's one of the most
painful conditions that exists.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.225
And very hard to diagnose.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.728
Thank God Dr. Park approved
all those tests.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.063
[sighs]

14:58.856 --> 15:00.482
Y-You were in agony.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.776
And I…

15:05.821 --> 15:07.823
I told him I thought you were lying.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.662
You thought I was lying?

15:16.498 --> 15:18.709
You thought I was just being an addict.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.006
And still you came here with me.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.469
Sat at my side.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.850
We'd like to do
a microvascular decompression.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.810
We'd go in through the back of your skull

15:36.894 --> 15:40.522
and put in a Teflon patch
to cushion the affected nerve.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.441
You're… You're cutting into his brain?

15:42.524 --> 15:44.485
It's relatively safe. And other options

15:44.568 --> 15:46.403
are unlikely to relieve the pain.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.365
Look, I-I'll do it.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.867
Uh, thank you so much.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.205
[Claire] We want to run
a vertebral artery BTO.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.415
If you tolerate it,
then we would sacrifice the…

15:58.499 --> 16:00.626
Sacrifice the vessel
with onyx embolization.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.795
We recognize you might
not love this proposal.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.089
The one in which
my hand weakness remains,

16:05.172 --> 16:06.382
destroying my career?

16:08.258 --> 16:10.803
Did you consider
vertebral-to-vertebral artery bypass

16:10.886 --> 16:13.222
with physical removal
of the aberrant artery?

16:13.305 --> 16:17.059
Mm, that would carry
a very high risk for a stroke or bleed.

16:17.142 --> 16:20.521
It would fix the dystonia
and let me get back to work.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.982
[Dr. Andrews]
With your history of carotid stenosis,

16:23.065 --> 16:25.275
it would be a coin flip
whether you survive.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.111
I can live with those numbers.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.613
Or, for that matter, die with them.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.161
[Dr. Lim] Corridor
to the trigeminal nerve origin is open.

16:36.870 --> 16:39.498
[Dr. Park] I freed up the offending
vessel. Teflon sponge.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.377
The sponge is too big.
It'll compress the brain stem.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.045
I have at least 4 millimeters of room.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.130
You have half that.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.881
Yes, you have a better view
50 feet away.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.800
[Dr. Lim] How long
have they been like this?

16:49.883 --> 16:51.510
[Asher] A while. It's getting worse.

16:51.593 --> 16:54.304
Sorry, Park, you're right.
Just like you were when you decided

16:54.388 --> 16:55.681
to discharge the sick guy.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.559
Wow, you invented sarcasm.
Really impressive.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.185
Hey, look at me, I'm using it, too.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.479
[Dr. Lim] Park, you missed the diagnosis.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.606
Reznick, you ignored protocol.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.067
How about you both show
some humility and shut up?

17:07.609 --> 17:08.610
Sorry.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.863
Teflon's placed.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.615
What if we used the saphenous
vein for the bypass?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.325
Not enough flow. He'll stroke out.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.744
Carotid to distal vert, then?

17:16.827 --> 17:18.787
Stenosis is too severe.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.955
Dude's loaded.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.207
He's at retirement age.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.169
He could teach, travel,
screw around all day.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.379
Why is he demanding that we do this?

17:28.338 --> 17:31.300
When you dedicate your life
to something that gives you meaning,

17:31.675 --> 17:33.427
it starts to define you.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.763
His decision may be irrational,
but I get it.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.806
I don't think it is irrational.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.936
Dr. Chambers has no friends,
no children,

17:43.020 --> 17:44.772
no family, no outside interests.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.483
If he can't be a surgeon,
he'll have nothing.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.529
I think our best bet is a radial graft.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.114
Highest flow I can think of.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.700
Any other ideas?

17:57.284 --> 17:59.703
Okay. We go with the radial graft.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.796
I'm impressed.

18:08.879 --> 18:12.508
I was actually starting
to wonder if I was losing my touch.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.593
But then I had
a dark afternoon of the soul

18:14.676 --> 18:16.220
and suddenly I knew it

18:16.303 --> 18:18.222
those were totally solid burns.

18:18.305 --> 18:22.142
Maybe not A+, but A-, B+ at the worst.

18:22.726 --> 18:26.313
So it hit me… Your plan was
to throw me off my game,

18:26.396 --> 18:27.481
make me doubt myself…

18:27.564 --> 18:28.565
I'm attracted to you.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.903
I've been fighting this stupid feeling,

18:32.986 --> 18:37.074
trying to find reasons to not… feel.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.541
Are you kidding me?

18:52.172 --> 18:53.924
[chuckles] Yes.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.592
Your jokes were lame.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.594
And that's how you screw with someone.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.055
No.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.933
You're not that good of a liar.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.062
I-I can't have a roommate
who has feelings for me.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.730
Since when can't you take a joke?

19:08.814 --> 19:10.649
Since my roommate hit on me.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.695
You have to move out.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.697
As soon as possible.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.712
We've decided to use
your radial artery for the graft.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.630
We've scheduled an OR
for tomorrow morning.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.340
-Good call.
-I agree.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.426
You should risk your life
for this surgery.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.512
Are you being facetious?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.181
No.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.473
[sighs]

19:44.683 --> 19:47.102
It just boggles the mind.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.938
You can't understand what anyone means.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.149
You can't express yourself like an adult.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.860
You're a child playing dress-up.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.778
And everyone here just plays along.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.363
Let's go, Shaun.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.531
Y-You're agitated.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.699
I'm fine.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.619
You are rubbing your mug.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.997
People with ASD
often have comfort objects

20:07.080 --> 20:08.540
for when they become agitated.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.459
I can order you propranolol.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.253
You're gonna give me
the Ruseckas-Freedman

20:13.337 --> 20:15.005
ASD Diagnostic Questionnaire,

20:15.088 --> 20:17.090
and that's gonna shut
your damn mouth.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.884
Okay, the "Rafad-Q" is just a tool.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.054
An official diagnosis needs
to come from a psychiatrist.

20:22.137 --> 20:25.432
Well, since I might be dead tomorrow,
this is your next-best option.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.314
I'll get the test.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.779
Why can't you treat people
with just an ounce of respect?

20:38.862 --> 20:41.865
Respect has to be earned,
not doled out like candy.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.867
No, that's just an excuse
people like you use

20:43.951 --> 20:45.369
to justify your garbage behavior.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.204
That's just an excuse people
like you use

20:47.287 --> 20:48.622
to avoid facing reality.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.417
No one was respectful to me
when I was a resident.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.420
They were dismissive and cruel.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.465
But it lit a fire
and it made me the man I am today.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.635
The man that you came
into my room idolizing.

21:02.761 --> 21:03.679
Not anymore.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.180
I'm devastated.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.269
Surgeons deal in human lives,

21:10.352 --> 21:12.104
not childish fantasies.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.981
If you want to succeed,

21:14.064 --> 21:16.900
you're gonna have to be
a lot more like me.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.205
Everything okay?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.708
-Yep.
-Surgery went very smoothly.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.875
No pain right now.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.919
Want to take it for a test drive?

21:39.923 --> 21:41.133
[breathes deeply]

21:47.681 --> 21:49.308
[shudders]

21:53.979 --> 21:55.188
It's worse.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.652
Collateral circulation is not ideal.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.946
How are we gonna harvest the artery?

22:06.366 --> 22:07.367
What's going on?

22:09.745 --> 22:12.497
How much am I gonna have to change
who I am to be a surgeon?

22:12.581 --> 22:15.334
Ah, to be great…
or even good… at anything,

22:15.417 --> 22:16.335
we have to compromise.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.256
I used to get too emotionally
involved in my work,

22:21.340 --> 22:23.675
with patients, everyone.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.552
And I had to learn to distance myself.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.929
Yeah, you've really grown cold
and heartless.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.264
I have changed.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.391
We all end up changing.

22:31.475 --> 22:33.685
You just got to try
and make it a good change.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.065
I don't want to change.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.653
I want to change what's around me.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.658
Oh, I'll figure it out. [chuckles]

22:48.742 --> 22:50.077
I'm sure you will.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.621
Hey, you're the guy who makes
living in a van look cool.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.122
[chuckles]

22:55.624 --> 22:57.042
So, uh, the circulation…

22:57.125 --> 22:59.544
The right side looks like
it has better length.

23:00.128 --> 23:02.631
Yeah. Better collateral, too.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.549
[footsteps approaching]

23:07.803 --> 23:09.179
Given the poor outcome,

23:09.262 --> 23:11.431
we can't recommend
further surgery right now.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.517
We suggest six months
of pain medication

23:13.600 --> 23:16.812
and referrals to neurology
and pain management specialists.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.024
W-What surgery aren't you recommending?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.317
A DREZ lesioning.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.736
We'd cut the signal
from the trigeminal nerve

23:24.820 --> 23:26.571
to the sensory areas of your brain.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.407
But there's a real possibility
of paralysis

23:29.491 --> 23:30.992
on one side of your body.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.161
I want the surgery.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.081
[Ana] Baby, I'll help you manage the pain.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.583
I-I'll move back in.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.961
I'll take care of you.

23:41.044 --> 23:43.463
You know how I treated you before.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.842
I'm only gonna get worse.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.886
I would never leave you again.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.056
That's what scares me.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.934
I'd start cutting you down,

23:56.893 --> 23:58.103
being cruel,

23:59.146 --> 24:00.856
and you'd just put up with it.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.023
[Ana sighs]

24:03.108 --> 24:04.985
I won't let that happen.

24:05.777 --> 24:06.862
[clicks tongue]

24:09.447 --> 24:10.949
We'll prep an OR.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.622
"I frequently point out
other people's mistakes."

24:17.706 --> 24:18.874
Duh.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.167
That's a yes.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.253
"People tell me I overthink things."

24:23.336 --> 24:25.672
Only people who underthink things.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.132
But, fine, another yes.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.426
"I sometimes speak in an abnormal tone."

24:29.509 --> 24:31.636
Who thinks they speak
in an abnormal tone?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.054
Just mark no.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.639
How many more of these?

24:34.723 --> 24:35.724
None.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.020
Your answers are fully congruent
with someone on the spectrum.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.273
No. You keyed it wrong.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.858
-No, look. No, I…
-Or something.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.693
-Here. Look, I didn't.
-No, give it to me.

24:46.776 --> 24:47.861
-No, I…
-Oh! Don't!

24:47.944 --> 24:49.029
[mug shatters]

24:50.822 --> 24:52.657
You idiot!

24:52.741 --> 24:54.367
S-Stupid, careless…

24:54.451 --> 24:55.702
I-I stepped back…

24:55.785 --> 24:56.995
Get out of my room.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.039
-Get out!
-Okay.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.919
[breathing heavily]

25:06.588 --> 25:09.633
[Dr. Lim] Make sure we're not impacting
normal spinal cord pathways.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.635
[Asher] Somatosensories are at baseline.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.011
[Dr. Park] BP's steady.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.972
[alarm sounding]

25:16.973 --> 25:19.351
Leg and arm SSEPs
at 50% decreased amplitude.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.311
Check the cord above and below
for hematoma

25:21.394 --> 25:22.729
or bony compression.

25:22.812 --> 25:23.980
Cord's fine.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.857
Push IV fluids and start pressors.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.025
So, what is it?

25:28.026 --> 25:28.860
I don't know.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.325
[alarm sounding]

25:35.408 --> 25:37.202
[Dr. Lim] Any issues
with motor potentials?

25:37.285 --> 25:38.870
[Asher] Unilateral amplitude down 70%.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.122
We're about to get
total neurological collapse.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.916
It's a clot from a small branch artery.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.668
We checked the spinal blood vessels…

25:44.751 --> 25:45.710
The outside.

25:45.794 --> 25:48.046
But the electrode could have
injured a sulcal artery.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.840
Follow the DREZ pathway inward
and search for a small clot.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.260
Start at the site of last
ablation with the electrode.

25:53.343 --> 25:54.552
It's gotta be deep.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.597
This'll be easier if she's in here.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.600
Scrub in, Dr. Reznick.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.983
[Claire] We're setting up
the neuromonitoring

26:08.066 --> 26:09.484
for Silas' surgery.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.114
He's angry with me.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.198
Silas?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.033
He's angry with everyone.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.120
Dr. Andrews said to stop
talking to him about ASD.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.372
But I brought it up anyway,
gave him a test,

26:22.455 --> 26:26.126
his mug broke,
and I don't know what to do now.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.294
I don't know what to feel.

26:27.377 --> 26:28.586
And Lea…

26:31.339 --> 26:34.426
Lea told me about the pregnancy.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.518
Okay.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.020
[exhales shakily]

26:49.357 --> 26:52.569
Is this hard for me because I'm dealing
with both things at once?

26:54.821 --> 26:57.240
I think both things are related.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.704
What if my child

27:03.621 --> 27:05.248
has no friends?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.375
What if they're picked on?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.294
This is not small-town Wyoming.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.670
The world has changed, Shaun.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.380
I haven't changed.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.507
How can I…

27:17.260 --> 27:18.511
…know what they're feeling?

27:18.595 --> 27:20.347
How can I comfort them?

27:23.183 --> 27:25.185
How can I be a good father?

27:30.106 --> 27:31.941
Remember when we first met?

27:32.359 --> 27:33.568
Right over there?

27:35.320 --> 27:36.738
You were mad at me.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.657
Yeah. But you were right
about the patient.

27:40.283 --> 27:42.494
And you were stubborn.
And crazy smart.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.788
And you are still all of those things.

27:45.914 --> 27:50.502
But if you were still just that guy

27:50.585 --> 27:52.337
that I met running through those doors,

27:52.420 --> 27:54.547
we would not be sitting here right now.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.885
You have changed.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.639
You've adapted. You've grown.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.225
Do you know how hard that is?

28:05.308 --> 28:06.935
Most people don't even try.

28:09.687 --> 28:15.318
And you are going to grow
into a great father.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.904
Whenever it happens.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.588
[Dr. Reznick] Slowly go perpendicular

28:35.672 --> 28:37.465
at the angle of our ablation electrode.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.176
Still not seeing the clot.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.096
[Asher] Amplitude loss at 80%.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.723
[Dr. Reznick] Maybe it's not a clot.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.683
Maybe it's something
higher up, in the brain.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.977
[Dr. Park] No.
You were right the first time.

28:49.769 --> 28:53.773
Maybe it's hiding behind some
ultrasound-impervious segment.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.568
Cut the dentate ligament.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.237
It'll get more lateral access.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.781
[Dr. Lim] Completely section the ligament.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.661
I see it.

29:09.789 --> 29:11.207
[Dr. Lim] Removing the clot.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.877
[alarm stops, monitor beeps]

29:15.086 --> 29:17.505
[Asher] Amplitude returning
to normal baseline.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.013
Let me know if you need me.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.389
[Dr. Lim] We're good.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.390
Thank you.

29:33.646 --> 29:34.856
[Dr. Park] Hey.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.109
We did good together.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.194
We did.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.782
You still have to move out, though.
Tonight.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.211
On my first day here,
Dr. Melendez said

29:56.294 --> 29:58.963
I would never do anything
besides suction.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.883
But later, he let me make
my first surgical incision.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.552
He became my friend.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.845
I miss him.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.223
Are you in the right room?

30:08.306 --> 30:11.893
Did somebody tell you
I needed pointless stories?

30:11.976 --> 30:14.521
I used to think

30:14.604 --> 30:18.441
being a doctor was
all I needed to make me happy.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.445
It did make me happy.

30:23.613 --> 30:26.032
But I realized I wanted more.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.202
And that I could have more.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.122
I changed.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.169
You can change, too.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.755
But not if you're dead from this surgery.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.510
I've made up my mind.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.762
Please leave.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.682
My brother Steve,

30:50.765 --> 30:53.601
he gave me a plastic scalpel
before he died.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.520
It broke. I was very sad.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.021
I asked you to leave.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.906
When I fixed my scalpel,
it made me feel better.

31:21.379 --> 31:25.466
I was 9 years old when my father died.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.307
I loved drinking hot chocolate
with him in the morning.

31:32.390 --> 31:36.811
He'd bring me a mug
after every business trip.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.689
He understood me.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.941
My mother didn't.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.443
Nobody did.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.989
I tried fitting in, but…

31:49.365 --> 31:51.367
I got frustrated.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.870
So I gave up.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.748
On relationships.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.333
On friends.

31:58.416 --> 32:02.503
On all but the one thing I was good at.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.760
And now, Dr. Murphy, I'm too old.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.470
I've made too many enemies.

32:10.553 --> 32:11.930
Too many mistakes.

32:13.681 --> 32:18.895
People tolerate me because I save lives.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.442
Without that

32:25.985 --> 32:29.822
why would anyone ever care about me?

32:34.661 --> 32:35.870
I care.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.128

33:15.994 --> 33:17.412

Mm, pasta with olive oil.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.253
Kinda puke-proof.

33:26.796 --> 33:29.632
Have you thought any more about…

33:30.425 --> 33:31.426
Yes.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.057
I made a list.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.657
I guess I've learned from you.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.418
What's the first thing yours says?

34:10.590 --> 34:13.426
That I think I would be a good father

34:15.636 --> 34:18.056
but that I can't know for sure.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.267
You'd make a great dad.

34:23.352 --> 34:24.645
It's on my list.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.405
You were right.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.909
It is very complicated.

34:39.786 --> 34:43.206
But I do know…

34:46.542 --> 34:48.544
I want you to be happy, Lea.

34:53.007 --> 34:56.094
I have so many reasons to do this.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.682
And so many doubts.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.561
I'm just scared, Shaun.

35:08.523 --> 35:12.527
But if we are both having doubts,

35:12.610 --> 35:17.448
then maybe now isn't the right time.

35:22.954 --> 35:23.955
Okay.

[sighs]

36:10.793 --> 36:11.627
Mm.

I see that my hemoglobin's stable

36:13.838 --> 36:16.132
and my white count is fine.

36:16.215 --> 36:18.718
Yeah. We just wrote
your discharge orders.

36:18.801 --> 36:22.138
This is a referral for an ASD specialist.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.058
I can look into that on my own.

And thank you, Dr. Guerin.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.186
Last year, I applied to a program
at Johns Hopkins.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.733
They'll let me enroll late.

Sounds like a good place for you.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.574
Thanks for always being a great boss.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.285
And a great friend.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.247
Can't have been that great,
sneaking out like this.

38:12.581 --> 38:15.751
Uh, actually,
for the first time I can remember,

38:15.835 --> 38:17.753
it felt hard to say goodbye.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.516
You're always doing so much
for other people.

38:31.350 --> 38:34.437
Please don't forget to do something
for yourself every now and then.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.794
Were you messing with me or not?

39:05.384 --> 39:07.386
If I was, would you let me stay?

39:11.766 --> 39:12.683
Yes.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.522
I wasn't messing with you.

Then I guess it's good
we're not roommates anymore.
