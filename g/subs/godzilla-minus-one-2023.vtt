WEBVTT

00:25.754 --> 00:27.255
[plane propellers whirring]

00:56.409 --> 00:57.660
[engine slowing down]

01:06.211 --> 01:07.378
[breathing heavily]

01:18.098 --> 01:19.099
ODO ISLAND NAVY DETACHMENT

01:19.099 --> 01:21.017
- [man 1] Ready? One, two...
- [man 2] One, two...

01:22.227 --> 01:23.061
One...

01:23.645 --> 01:25.772
- Nothing wrong with the engine.
- [man 3] Roger.

01:25.772 --> 01:28.233
- No issues with the fuel line.
- [man 3] Understood.

01:36.533 --> 01:37.992
Ensign Shikishima, right?

01:39.744 --> 01:41.871
I was a mechanic
at the Tsukuba Naval Air Corps.

01:41.871 --> 01:44.082
Tachibana. We were there at the same time.

01:44.082 --> 01:48.128
Tachibana? Oh, of course, yes.
I owe you and your men.

01:49.546 --> 01:50.588
[Tachibana sighs]

01:51.506 --> 01:53.967
This runway of ours
is chock-full of holes,

01:53.967 --> 01:56.010
and you were still able to land safely.

01:57.303 --> 01:59.305
You haven't lost your touch
since we last met.

01:59.305 --> 02:02.517
[chuckles] Well,
training for dogfights was simple.

02:02.517 --> 02:04.602
It's different in a real kamikaze.

02:06.813 --> 02:08.148
Yes, it is.

02:08.148 --> 02:10.567
Lucky you got
this extra chance to rest, huh?

02:13.236 --> 02:14.320
It's strange.

02:15.238 --> 02:16.656
Your rig, we looked it over.

02:16.656 --> 02:19.617
And not a single one of us
could pin down any issues.

02:21.244 --> 02:24.330
[exhales nervously]
What are you trying to say?

02:48.313 --> 02:49.480
I'm on your side.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.150
We need more people like you.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.409
I just don't see what the point is.

03:01.409 --> 03:05.038
We know how this war is gonna end,
so why "die honorably" now?

03:14.589 --> 03:15.465
[sighs]

03:25.099 --> 03:26.476
[inhales deeply]

03:26.476 --> 03:27.852
[water lapping gently]

03:29.187 --> 03:30.563
[sighs]

03:31.898 --> 03:34.317
[water plopping]

03:55.630 --> 03:57.882
[air-raid siren blaring]

04:00.885 --> 04:01.719
Get the guns!

04:01.719 --> 04:03.096
- Yes, sir!
- Roger!

04:04.305 --> 04:05.723
- Is it a raid?
- [man 4] I don't know!

04:05.723 --> 04:08.643
- [man 5] What do you mean?
- We can't see. It's too dark!

04:08.643 --> 04:10.144
Is it the Americans again?

04:10.144 --> 04:11.771
- [distant snarling]
- [all gasp]

04:14.023 --> 04:15.024
[distant crashing]

04:15.566 --> 04:17.694
Taki! Taki!

04:18.278 --> 04:20.238
- Get a light on this!
- Roger!

04:20.238 --> 04:21.781
[crashing]

04:23.032 --> 04:25.702
- [snarling]
- [Taki yelps]

04:25.702 --> 04:27.537
- [panicked yelping]
- [footsteps approaching]

04:28.705 --> 04:29.664
[Taki screams]

04:29.664 --> 04:30.873
[snarling]

04:31.916 --> 04:33.001
[shocked whimpering]

04:33.668 --> 04:35.003
- Taki!
- Taki-san!

04:35.003 --> 04:36.713
What the hell is that thing?

04:36.713 --> 04:37.880
It's called Godzilla.

04:38.548 --> 04:41.009
- What's Godzilla?
- [man 6] One of the locals told me.

04:41.009 --> 04:43.970
When deep sea fish float
like today, Godzilla is near.

04:44.595 --> 04:45.972
[hesitates] Godzilla?

04:47.932 --> 04:49.100
[soldiers gasping]

04:49.100 --> 04:51.561
[roaring]

04:52.061 --> 04:53.146
We're done for.

04:53.813 --> 04:56.357
- Go! Take cover!
- Go! Get in the trenches!

04:56.357 --> 04:57.942
- Now! Go!
- [panicked screaming]

04:57.942 --> 05:00.820
[Godzilla snarling]

05:02.655 --> 05:04.699
[man 7] Hurry! Hurry!

05:04.699 --> 05:06.326
[panicked murmuring]

05:08.077 --> 05:09.537
What the hell is that thing?

05:10.121 --> 05:11.372
No one knows what it is.

05:11.372 --> 05:12.623
[footstep rumbles]

05:13.207 --> 05:15.209
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

05:16.586 --> 05:18.671
Think you can reach your 20 mm gun?

05:19.422 --> 05:21.257
You're the only one
who knows how to shoot.

05:21.257 --> 05:22.800
We're just mechanics.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.010
It's gigantic.

05:24.510 --> 05:26.596
What if it doesn't work
and just makes it angrier?

05:26.596 --> 05:29.766
- A 20 mm gun's enough to kill anything!
- [footsteps approaching]

05:29.766 --> 05:32.060
Now go, hurry.
It's still heading this way.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.562
Hurry! Get out there!

05:35.271 --> 05:36.105
Go!

05:37.440 --> 05:38.274
Hurry!

05:39.192 --> 05:40.818
[breathing heavily]

05:40.818 --> 05:42.362
[tense music playing]

05:45.782 --> 05:46.824
[Godzilla huffs]

05:46.824 --> 05:48.534
[Shikishima breathing heavily]

05:51.454 --> 05:52.497
Get in!

05:58.503 --> 06:02.548
[Godzilla growling]

06:07.762 --> 06:09.138
Does he need an invitation?

06:12.183 --> 06:13.726
[Godzilla growling softly]

06:14.644 --> 06:16.604
[footstep rumbles]

06:16.604 --> 06:18.231
Come on! Shoot!

06:21.359 --> 06:24.278
[Godzilla snarling]

06:31.994 --> 06:33.413
It's still coming!

06:34.705 --> 06:38.251
- What do we do, Tachibana?
- We need ammo! Go get some rounds.

06:40.711 --> 06:42.338
[man 5 panting]

06:42.338 --> 06:43.923
[yelling fearfully]

06:43.923 --> 06:45.007
[Godzilla grunts]

06:45.007 --> 06:47.343
You idiots! Don't shoot!

06:47.343 --> 06:48.386
[mechanics screaming]

06:48.386 --> 06:50.471
[Tachibana] What are you doing?
Cease fire!

06:52.974 --> 06:54.267
[roaring angrily]

06:56.227 --> 06:58.813
Go! Get out! Get out!

06:58.813 --> 07:00.148
Fall back!

07:00.148 --> 07:02.233
- [panicked chattering]
- [pained yelping]

07:02.859 --> 07:04.277
[gasping fearfully]

07:05.361 --> 07:06.446
Tachibana!

07:07.989 --> 07:09.365
[pained grunting]

07:09.365 --> 07:11.117
[man 5 screaming]

07:11.117 --> 07:13.077
[gunfire]

07:13.619 --> 07:14.871
[man 6] Shoot it!

07:14.871 --> 07:17.081
[panicked squealing, gasping]

07:17.081 --> 07:18.583
[dramatic music playing]

07:23.671 --> 07:25.756
[mechanics whimpering]

07:28.593 --> 07:29.594
[gunfire]

07:32.680 --> 07:33.806
[man 8] Tomita!

07:33.806 --> 07:35.141
[whimpering]

07:38.186 --> 07:39.896
[distraught sobbing]

07:42.315 --> 07:43.858
[hyperventilating]

07:46.152 --> 07:47.528
I'll draw it this way.

07:47.528 --> 07:48.779
Shoot to kill!

07:49.447 --> 07:50.656
[screaming]

07:51.282 --> 07:52.825
[yelping fearfully]

07:54.994 --> 07:57.205
- [metal crunching]
- [glass shattering]

08:00.791 --> 08:01.834
[grunts]

08:02.668 --> 08:03.878
[pained gasping]

08:11.552 --> 08:14.138
[Godzilla roaring angrily]

08:16.140 --> 08:18.059
[sound fading]

08:19.810 --> 08:21.229
[music fades]

08:23.189 --> 08:24.357
[groans softly]

08:27.693 --> 08:29.487
[breathing heavily]

08:53.177 --> 08:55.054
[breathing rapidly]

09:01.477 --> 09:02.520
[strained grunting]

09:03.020 --> 09:05.106
[Tachibana] You boys didn't deserve this.

09:07.066 --> 09:08.276
[strained panting]

09:16.409 --> 09:17.243
Hey!

09:20.246 --> 09:21.122
Hey.

09:26.002 --> 09:27.753
Yeah, that's right. Take a look!

09:29.880 --> 09:31.382
Everyone is dead!

09:31.382 --> 09:32.967
[disquieting music playing]

09:33.676 --> 09:36.387
Huh? All because you didn't shoot!

09:37.471 --> 09:39.098
[Tachibana hyperventilating]

09:41.100 --> 09:42.226
Goddamn it!

09:49.650 --> 09:50.693
[Tachibana sobs]

09:55.114 --> 09:56.782
[disquieting music continues]

10:21.140 --> 10:22.058
[Tachibana] You.

10:22.975 --> 10:23.809
Hey!

10:44.705 --> 10:45.790
[grunts] Move.

11:01.931 --> 11:03.766
[disquieting music continues]

11:05.559 --> 11:07.895
- [man 1] Make sure it's not too loose.
- [man 2] Yes.

11:08.396 --> 11:11.190
[man 1] Yeah, that should hold.
Okay, let's go.

11:12.692 --> 11:14.068
[music building]

11:20.324 --> 11:22.243
[woman] Koichi? Is that you?

11:25.496 --> 11:26.664
Oh, Sumiko.

11:27.415 --> 11:29.041
I thought you were dead.

11:31.127 --> 11:32.920
Weren't you a kamikaze pilot?

11:40.094 --> 11:43.139
You have the nerve to come back
and show your face here?

11:43.806 --> 11:45.349
You disgraced us all!

11:46.767 --> 11:47.852
Take a look around.

11:47.852 --> 11:51.063
Do you see what happened to us
because of cowards like you?

11:53.357 --> 11:55.901
If you'd all done
what you were supposed to do,

11:56.944 --> 11:58.779
I'd still have my kids.

12:08.622 --> 12:11.584
Are my parents alive?
Do you know if they made it out?

12:18.716 --> 12:20.217
Everyone's dead.

12:23.053 --> 12:26.724
During the air raids,
there was fire covering this whole block.

12:29.477 --> 12:32.021
Your parents are dead.
Along with everyone.

12:34.690 --> 12:38.068
Including my children,
who met the very same fate.

12:51.165 --> 12:54.084
MY DEAREST SON, KOICHI...

12:56.003 --> 12:57.630
"Return to us alive."

13:01.342 --> 13:02.885
Isn't that what you wanted?

13:07.515 --> 13:09.225
[indistinct background chatter]

13:15.397 --> 13:17.107
- Is it good?
- [man 1] Not bad.

13:19.235 --> 13:20.778
[man 2] Stop! Stop, thief!

13:21.612 --> 13:24.114
- [woman 1] Out of my way!
- [man 2] Move! Move!

13:24.114 --> 13:25.449
[woman 1] Let me through!

13:25.449 --> 13:26.826
[man 1] Grab that woman!

13:26.826 --> 13:27.868
Hold on.

13:27.868 --> 13:29.620
[crowd gasping, jeering]

13:29.620 --> 13:31.080
- [woman 1] Take this!
- What?

13:31.080 --> 13:34.583
- [man 2] Hey! That's her! Get back here!
- [man 3] Catch that woman!

13:34.583 --> 13:36.001
[man 2] Thief!

13:36.585 --> 13:37.545
[baby gurgling]

13:37.545 --> 13:38.879
What on earth?

13:45.052 --> 13:47.471
- [baby whimpering]
- [women chattering]

13:49.306 --> 13:51.684
- Give everyone my love.
- Yes, good to see you.

13:51.684 --> 13:52.810
Hello.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.395
[baby cooing]

13:57.314 --> 13:59.775
[woman 2] Okay. Take care of yourself.

13:59.775 --> 14:00.818
[woman 3] Bye!

14:04.196 --> 14:05.281
[sighs]

14:07.867 --> 14:08.909
Hello again!

14:10.494 --> 14:11.412
[Shikishima sighs]

14:12.788 --> 14:14.832
Thank goodness. Where were you?

14:16.375 --> 14:19.169
Hey, it's your own fault.
I couldn't just go out there.

14:19.169 --> 14:20.713
Too many lookie-loo's.

14:21.422 --> 14:23.799
So you've been here
watching the whole time?

14:24.800 --> 14:27.761
Yeah. I was starting to get sick
of waiting for you to move.

14:28.262 --> 14:29.221
Wasn't I?

14:30.097 --> 14:32.057
I bet you're hungry now, aren't you?

14:32.600 --> 14:33.517
[chuckles softly]

14:35.102 --> 14:37.563
I thought you'd just leave her there.
Why didn't you?

14:38.397 --> 14:39.231
Hey!

14:41.275 --> 14:44.445
[Shikishima] I couldn't leave a baby alone
in a place like that.

14:46.989 --> 14:47.907
[woman 1] Oh?

14:49.867 --> 14:51.118
Oh really?

14:54.830 --> 14:56.624
Could you please stop following me?

14:57.124 --> 14:59.960
[woman 1] But we'll die
if you leave us out here alone.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.295
Why would I care?

15:07.176 --> 15:09.637
After you're done eating,
would you please leave?

15:10.179 --> 15:13.307
Oh, you hear that?
He's so mean and scary, isn't he?

15:17.186 --> 15:18.687
Where's your husband, anyway?

15:19.396 --> 15:20.731
Did he fight in the war?

15:22.066 --> 15:25.069
What a question.
Does it look like I have a husband?

15:25.069 --> 15:25.986
What?

15:26.904 --> 15:28.030
Whose kid is she?

15:29.865 --> 15:32.576
- Does it matter?
- Of course it matters!

15:36.497 --> 15:38.707
[woman 1] It was
during one of the air raids.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.002
Her dying mother asked me to take her.

15:44.129 --> 15:48.509
So... are you saying
you're not related to her?

15:49.677 --> 15:50.928
No. And so what?

15:54.056 --> 15:55.432
Are you insane?

15:56.266 --> 15:59.478
You have no business trying to take care
of a baby in the state you're in.

15:59.478 --> 16:02.106
- [woman 1] You're one to talk.
- [Shikishima] Hey!

16:08.904 --> 16:09.738
What's her name?

16:13.492 --> 16:15.494
AKIKO

16:16.829 --> 16:18.122
And what do I call you?

16:20.874 --> 16:21.792
Noriko.

16:25.087 --> 16:27.089
Why do you go around dressed like that?

16:27.089 --> 16:29.591
You look like you spend your days
begging for money.

16:30.175 --> 16:31.844
Am I supposed to be a whore instead?

16:31.844 --> 16:33.595
That's not what I said, but

16:35.139 --> 16:36.557
we're all trying to survive.

16:36.557 --> 16:38.767
If you were, I wouldn't think less of you.

16:44.940 --> 16:45.983
Any family?

16:54.908 --> 16:56.285
HARU SHIKISHIMA
EIICHIRO SHIKISHIMA

16:56.285 --> 16:57.703
[Noriko] Your parents?

17:02.166 --> 17:03.000
Yeah.

17:04.877 --> 17:05.919
They were killed.

17:06.795 --> 17:07.921
In the air raids.

17:12.468 --> 17:14.386
So you're by yourself now as well.

17:33.822 --> 17:34.698
[Shikishima] Huh?

17:34.698 --> 17:36.742
What? You can't stay here.

17:38.410 --> 17:39.828
Are you kidding me?

17:43.082 --> 17:44.041
[sighs]

17:54.218 --> 17:55.219
[Sumiko] Hey.

17:57.596 --> 17:59.056
What's the story, huh?

18:00.724 --> 18:03.560
- What story?
- [Sumiko] Don't play dumb with me.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.939
That mother and child
you took in last night.

18:07.439 --> 18:09.858
What, so now you think
you're some kind of saint?

18:09.858 --> 18:10.984
[Shikishima sighs]

18:11.819 --> 18:13.570
I didn't even want them to stay.

18:14.404 --> 18:17.574
What difference does that make?
You didn't kick them out.

18:19.618 --> 18:20.619
[sighs wearily]

18:21.829 --> 18:23.705
It's too late to play the hero.

18:25.624 --> 18:27.626
I see right through you.

18:27.626 --> 18:29.670
Don't bother asking me for help.

18:34.842 --> 18:35.676
Wait.

18:37.386 --> 18:40.139
The girl. Do you know
if she can breastfeed?

18:41.890 --> 18:43.433
No, she's...

18:43.433 --> 18:46.395
The child, she isn't the mother.

18:48.021 --> 18:49.273
What are you saying?

18:49.773 --> 18:51.024
[Sumiko] Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

18:51.692 --> 18:53.569
Hmm? Mm-hmm.

18:56.864 --> 18:57.948
There you go.

18:59.825 --> 19:00.826
[sighs]

19:01.743 --> 19:04.830
If you keep feeding her like this,
she'll die of malnutrition.

19:05.330 --> 19:07.416
Right? Ah.

19:08.625 --> 19:12.004
So you take in a child,
but you have no idea how to care for it.

19:12.796 --> 19:14.214
What were you thinking?

19:14.965 --> 19:16.341
I'm not sure.

19:20.596 --> 19:21.513
[Sumiko sighs]

19:25.100 --> 19:26.852
This isn't for either of you.

19:28.228 --> 19:30.105
Adults can survive on anything.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.568
[grunts wearily]

19:35.777 --> 19:37.863
Use it to make gruel for the baby.

19:38.947 --> 19:39.948
Ah, well,

19:40.866 --> 19:43.202
there goes all of my prized white rice.

19:44.578 --> 19:46.455
Pains in the neck, those two.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.631
[Shikishima breathing heavily, grunts]

19:58.258 --> 20:00.052
Argh. Damn it.

20:00.052 --> 20:01.720
It's pouring out there.

20:03.180 --> 20:04.348
I'm soaked.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.395
Did you find any work?

20:10.395 --> 20:12.731
[Shikishima] Well, actually,

20:12.731 --> 20:14.191
I did find something, but...

20:14.942 --> 20:16.235
Well, that's good news.

20:17.819 --> 20:19.905
[Shikishima] The money's not bad either.

20:19.905 --> 20:21.073
Here, look.

20:21.782 --> 20:24.326
See what it says?
There's an advance of 3,000 yen.

20:24.326 --> 20:26.036
That's great, isn't it?

20:30.874 --> 20:32.542
It can't be real though.

20:32.542 --> 20:35.796
You remember that other job
where all our rice got stolen?

20:35.796 --> 20:38.423
It's not like that.
Things are different this time.

20:38.423 --> 20:40.425
How can you know that for sure though?

20:40.425 --> 20:43.303
'Cause this one's got
the government backing it.

20:43.303 --> 20:45.722
And it pays this well for a good reason.

20:46.515 --> 20:47.683
What reason?

20:47.683 --> 20:48.892
During the war,

20:49.893 --> 20:52.854
both the US and Imperial navies
laid thousands of mines,

20:52.854 --> 20:55.649
and... they need us to clear them out.

20:57.693 --> 21:00.946
They're offering so much money... because...

21:03.991 --> 21:07.995
this work,
it carries a certain kind of risk.

21:10.038 --> 21:11.540
Listen to what you're saying!

21:11.540 --> 21:13.417
You can't do this!
You just survived a war!

21:13.417 --> 21:15.252
It's not exactly a choice!

21:15.252 --> 21:17.838
We won't make it
if something doesn't change.

21:17.838 --> 21:19.464
Akiko will starve to death.

21:20.674 --> 21:24.303
I understand that,
but... I can't let you go.

21:25.387 --> 21:27.931
[Shikishima] Look, this'll bring in money.

21:28.724 --> 21:31.310
And with it,
we can buy American powdered milk

21:31.310 --> 21:33.687
or anything else. If that means that I--

21:34.688 --> 21:36.773
I can't let that happen to you!

21:40.986 --> 21:42.029
Listen to me.

21:42.863 --> 21:45.991
Just 'cause this is risky,
it doesn't mean that I'll die.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.745
This isn't like the war.
It's not hopeless.

21:54.708 --> 21:57.169
Anyway, they said they use boats

21:57.169 --> 21:59.963
that are specially made
to evade magnetic mines.

22:04.593 --> 22:07.888
This is it? This is specially made?

22:07.888 --> 22:09.264
[boat creaking]

22:21.943 --> 22:24.654
Hey there. Are you our new sharpshooter?

22:24.654 --> 22:25.655
Shikishima, yes.

22:25.655 --> 22:26.573
Ex-Navy, huh?

22:26.573 --> 22:27.908
I flew a fighter, actually.

22:27.908 --> 22:30.285
What the hell?
What do we do with this guy?

22:30.285 --> 22:31.870
An airman? You saw action, didn't you?

22:31.870 --> 22:34.873
He's a military castoff.
Not worth anything to us.

22:34.873 --> 22:36.291
Are you disappointed

22:37.125 --> 22:39.252
that we're using
this old thing? [chuckles]

22:39.836 --> 22:41.046
Well, during the war,

22:41.046 --> 22:44.591
the US and Imperial navies laid
nearly 60,000 mines of all sorts

22:44.591 --> 22:46.051
off the coasts of Japan,

22:46.051 --> 22:49.012
but the ones that worry us
are the American magnetic kind.

22:49.554 --> 22:52.182
If a vessel made out of metal
goes anywhere near one,

22:52.182 --> 22:53.392
a blast is triggered.

22:55.352 --> 22:57.521
Ah. Hence, the wood.

22:57.521 --> 22:59.773
Mm. You catch on pretty quick.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.318
Most of what we can handle
are the standard moored mines.

23:03.318 --> 23:06.822
But with the magnetic ones,
wooden boats are the best countermeasure.

23:09.324 --> 23:10.492
Noda's the name.

23:11.743 --> 23:15.122
During the war, I worked for a while
designing weapons for the navy.

23:15.122 --> 23:17.791
That's our captain, Akitsu,
and that's Mizushima there.

23:17.791 --> 23:19.459
You can call this one "Kid." He's "Doc."

23:19.459 --> 23:21.878
I'm not very fond of that nickname,
and you know that.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.713
And I'm way too old for "kid" now.

23:23.713 --> 23:26.299
Sure, but seeing as you're
the greenest one, you're still "Kid."

23:26.299 --> 23:29.553
Yeah, I know. I didn't get to fight
in the war like you. I was too young.

23:29.553 --> 23:32.139
Our minesweeper here
is called the Shinseimaru.

23:32.139 --> 23:34.433
That's the Kaishinmaru parked there.

23:34.433 --> 23:38.979
The mines we're after are tethered
to the seabed like balloons on strings.

23:39.521 --> 23:43.733
So we run a cable between our two boats
with a cutter in the middle.

23:43.733 --> 23:46.111
All we have to do is clip the tether,

23:46.111 --> 23:48.572
and the mine floats to the surface.

23:48.572 --> 23:50.115
Then we hit it with this.

23:51.450 --> 23:53.076
Da-da-da-da-da-dada!

23:54.077 --> 23:55.162
Let me show you.

24:05.714 --> 24:08.467
[grunts] This one's
a little bit squirrelly.

24:09.259 --> 24:10.469
Could you let me try?

24:11.303 --> 24:12.679
Think you can handle her?

24:14.097 --> 24:14.931
Here.

24:17.559 --> 24:19.352
Since we're rocking like this,

24:19.352 --> 24:22.898
I'm trying to account for how
the waves are also moving the target.

24:29.905 --> 24:31.198
Whoa-oh!

24:31.198 --> 24:32.699
[chuckling gleefully]

24:32.699 --> 24:34.034
Nice one!

24:34.534 --> 24:36.411
I learned how to shoot down fighters.

24:36.411 --> 24:38.872
But I never saw real action,
just simulations.

24:38.872 --> 24:39.831
[Mizushima] What?

24:40.749 --> 24:42.542
You never saw any real action?

24:43.043 --> 24:45.378
I guess Shikishima
is just as green as me, huh?

24:45.378 --> 24:48.173
Learn how to fly a plane
like he can, then we can talk.

24:48.173 --> 24:51.176
If I'd fought in the war,
I know I'd have been useful too.

24:51.176 --> 24:53.970
Ah, if only it had just kept on going.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.184
Don't say anything like that ever again.

25:01.019 --> 25:03.188
[chuckles nervously] It was just a joke.

25:07.150 --> 25:08.568
Use your brain, Kid.

25:14.449 --> 25:15.867
[thundering footstep]

25:21.081 --> 25:22.165
[thundering footstep]

25:23.917 --> 25:25.418
[unsettling music playing]

25:28.088 --> 25:29.172
[thundering footstep]

25:32.133 --> 25:33.176
[Shikishima gasps]

25:34.094 --> 25:35.971
- [panicked shouting]
- We have to stop it!

25:35.971 --> 25:38.640
- [mechanics yelping]
- [man 1] Fire! Shoot it, guys! Shoot it!

25:38.640 --> 25:41.351
Fire! Fall back! Go! Go!

25:41.893 --> 25:43.228
[man 2 screams]

25:43.228 --> 25:44.646
[ominous music playing]

25:47.649 --> 25:48.984

25:53.113 --> 25:54.906
[screaming]

25:54.906 --> 25:56.658
[gasps, panting]

25:59.160 --> 26:00.161
You all right?

26:01.705 --> 26:02.539
Oh.

26:07.836 --> 26:09.045
Another nightmare?

26:17.387 --> 26:18.346
Nightmare?

26:22.183 --> 26:23.184
That's right.

26:24.853 --> 26:26.521
I was dreaming.

26:34.195 --> 26:35.155
What if

26:36.781 --> 26:38.950
you here, that's the dream?

26:39.659 --> 26:42.203
- I don't understand you. Are you sure--
- Is this...?

26:42.203 --> 26:44.080
We're in Japan, right? Right?

26:44.080 --> 26:46.916
I... I made it back alive.
I came back, right? Right?!

26:46.916 --> 26:49.711
- I... I made it back alive, right?
- Get off! [grunts]

26:51.171 --> 26:52.922
[panting]

27:10.357 --> 27:11.441
Right, I know.

27:12.192 --> 27:14.027
I know. [sobbing]

27:15.445 --> 27:16.696
I know.

27:20.158 --> 27:23.078

27:53.566 --> 27:55.151
[idyllic music continues]

28:01.950 --> 28:04.244
- [idyllic music continues]
- [inaudible]

28:23.430 --> 28:26.891
[Akitsu] You've built a real nice place.
It's worth every penny saved.

28:26.891 --> 28:27.892
SHIKISHIMA

28:27.892 --> 28:29.602
[laughter]

28:29.602 --> 28:31.229
- [Shikishima] Mmm.
- [Mizushima] Mmm.

28:31.229 --> 28:32.355
[chuckling]

28:33.106 --> 28:34.441
Would you like some more?

28:34.441 --> 28:36.693
Ah. Yes, please. Thanks.

28:38.945 --> 28:41.489
Uh, how about a photo, huh? [chuckles]

28:41.489 --> 28:44.576
[chuckles] Oh no, please,
don't waste your film on me.

28:44.576 --> 28:47.078
- [all chuckling]
- Look at that smile! Hold it!

28:47.078 --> 28:48.413
- Hold it.
- [Mizushima] Very nice.

28:48.413 --> 28:50.123
- [Noda] And...
- [shutter clicks]

28:51.124 --> 28:52.125
- Ah!
- [chuckling]

28:52.125 --> 28:53.752
- [Noriko] Thank you.
- Watch out, Doc.

28:53.752 --> 28:55.962
- Don't go falling for Noriko.
- [Mizushima] He's right.

28:55.962 --> 28:59.382
You shouldn't joke like that.
Noriko's a married woman. [chuckles]

28:59.382 --> 29:01.426
Everyone, please, that's enough!

29:01.426 --> 29:02.802
I'm not his wife.

29:06.681 --> 29:07.682
She's not?

29:08.600 --> 29:10.351
Yeah, she just showed up one day.

29:11.102 --> 29:14.230
She had nowhere else to go,
so I let her stay.

29:14.981 --> 29:16.191
And the little girl?

29:16.191 --> 29:17.901
She brought Akiko with her.

29:17.901 --> 29:20.445
But they're not related to each other.
Not really.

29:20.445 --> 29:23.990
She was an orphan
that Noriko took in during the air raids.

29:23.990 --> 29:24.949
[Noda] Oh.

29:25.825 --> 29:28.369
You all found each other.
What a lovely story.

29:28.369 --> 29:31.039
[chuckles awkwardly]
That's just sort of how it went.

29:33.583 --> 29:34.584
Daddy.

29:36.961 --> 29:38.588
- Akiko.
- [Akiko] Mm?

29:40.089 --> 29:42.759
I told you. You know I'm not your father.

29:45.094 --> 29:46.387
Oh, Shikishima!

29:47.055 --> 29:49.849
- That's awful. How could you say that?
- What a hurtful thing to say.

29:50.975 --> 29:54.521
Here's the thing,
fate has brought you together as a family.

29:55.146 --> 29:56.898
You need to find a way to accept that.

29:56.898 --> 29:59.275
That's right. Now I need a hug!

29:59.275 --> 30:00.401
[laughter]

30:00.401 --> 30:01.694
- Yeah.
- That's enough!

30:02.529 --> 30:03.738
I don't want that.

30:06.699 --> 30:07.534
[sighs]

30:09.994 --> 30:10.995
[Akitsu] Why not?

30:17.585 --> 30:19.170
[motorcycle approaching]

30:26.719 --> 30:29.514
[Noriko] Welcome home.
I just got back myself.

30:30.348 --> 30:32.183
What are those clothes you have on?

30:35.186 --> 30:36.396
How do I look?

30:37.272 --> 30:39.232
I went to Ginza and found myself a job.

30:39.232 --> 30:42.485
Uh, well, is this 'cause
I don't provide enough for you?

30:48.449 --> 30:51.327
It's not that. I just always wanted
to be self-sufficient.

30:52.704 --> 30:55.707
And you'll never find a wife
if I'm always around.

31:00.086 --> 31:01.170
And besides,

31:01.170 --> 31:03.506
Ginza's come such a long way
since the war.

31:04.299 --> 31:05.675
This feels so sudden.

31:06.801 --> 31:08.303
I don't really think it is.

31:09.554 --> 31:10.805
Well, Akiko!

31:11.306 --> 31:13.600
Uh, what will Akiko do?

31:13.600 --> 31:17.687
Who's going to be here to look after her
while you go work in Ginza?

31:18.438 --> 31:21.316
We talked, and Sumiko said
she'd be happy to watch her.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.861
- Oh.
- She seemed very excited.

31:24.861 --> 31:28.323
She said, "I've already raised three.
Why not?" [chuckles]

31:29.741 --> 31:31.159
Oh, I see.

31:31.826 --> 31:33.536
Well, all right, then.

31:35.038 --> 31:37.206
Good. I'll go get Akiko.

31:46.132 --> 31:47.467
[sighs]

<i>was attacked and disabled
by an unknown enemy.</i>

31:54.265 --> 31:56.351
<i>No further details known at this time.</i>

31:56.851 --> 32:00.730
<i>Intercepted urgent distress call
from Pacific Fleet attack sub USS Redfish,</i>

32:00.730 --> 32:02.774
<i>reporting pursuit
of massive undersea organism</i>

32:02.774 --> 32:04.192
<i>through Pacific waters.</i>

32:04.192 --> 32:06.277
<i>After successfully photographing target,</i>

32:06.277 --> 32:08.696
<i>Redfish made contact and was destroyed.</i>

32:08.696 --> 32:11.449
<i>Wreck reconnaissance picked up
radio-isotope emissions</i>

32:11.449 --> 32:13.785
<i>where hull collided
with enemy creature skin.</i>

32:18.873 --> 32:20.792
[man 2] <i>The colossal sea creature
is projected</i>

32:20.792 --> 32:23.503
<i>to reach the Japanese archipelago
within a few weeks.</i>

32:23.503 --> 32:27.465
<i>Its recorded movement suggests
a course to the Kanto region specifically.</i>

32:27.465 --> 32:29.300
[warning beacon beeping]

32:29.300 --> 32:32.845
[man 2] <i>General Douglas MacArthur
commented on the developing situation,</i>

32:32.845 --> 32:34.305
<i>stating with regret</i>

32:34.305 --> 32:38.601
<i>that recent Soviet movements prevent
any US military assistance.</i>

32:38.601 --> 32:42.313
<i>He instead calls on Japan to begin
strengthening its own security forces</i>

32:42.313 --> 32:45.316
<i>in preparation
for potential contact with the beast.</i>

32:45.316 --> 32:46.818
[projector whirs]

32:46.818 --> 32:48.903
[foreboding music playing]

32:58.538 --> 33:00.164
[Akitsu] What could do this?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.333
Some kind of whale?

33:04.002 --> 33:05.336
Or giant shark?

33:05.336 --> 33:08.506
Shark or whale couldn't do that.
No, this is something else.

33:09.507 --> 33:13.094
- [Mizushima] Maybe a new Soviet weapon?
- [Noda] Does that look like weapon damage?

33:13.094 --> 33:14.721
Then what else could it be?

33:15.513 --> 33:17.557
My guess would be an enormous creature.

33:17.557 --> 33:21.185
Oh, come on. Your crazy theories
aren't any better than ours.

33:21.185 --> 33:24.313
I was skeptical
until I got a closer look at this.

33:26.941 --> 33:27.775
Godzilla.

33:29.569 --> 33:31.696
Uh... Look! Starboard side!

33:31.696 --> 33:33.072
[Akitsu] Huh?

33:33.656 --> 33:34.699
[Noda] Huh?

33:35.283 --> 33:37.618
[Shikishima] I saw deep sea fish
floating just like this

33:37.618 --> 33:39.537
the day a monster attacked Odo island.

33:39.537 --> 33:42.206
A monster? Like what?

33:42.206 --> 33:43.750
It was like a dinosaur

33:43.750 --> 33:46.502
that, over the years,
had turned into something else.

33:47.045 --> 33:50.798
I remember hearing
that the locals called it Godzilla.

33:51.632 --> 33:52.467
Godzilla?

33:52.467 --> 33:56.637
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.
I bet you just saw a tank that you--

33:56.637 --> 33:58.347
You can believe me or not.

33:58.347 --> 34:00.058
It still doesn't change the fact

34:00.058 --> 34:03.519
that Godzilla wiped out
everyone on Odo Island.

34:04.103 --> 34:05.104
Wait a minute.

34:06.022 --> 34:08.357
I thought the Americans
took out that garrison.

34:10.234 --> 34:13.696
[Shikishima] The US island-hopping forces
never targeted Odo.

34:14.280 --> 34:18.159
At that point, it was only being used
as a repair base for kamikaze planes.

34:18.826 --> 34:20.244
Wait, Shikishima.

34:21.662 --> 34:23.456
Does that mean you were a kamikaze pilot?

34:29.545 --> 34:32.423
[Shikishima] If this is the same Godzilla
I saw back then,

34:33.257 --> 34:36.719
and it can do this,
then it's even bigger than before.

34:39.430 --> 34:41.349
[Mizushima giggles nervously]

34:42.767 --> 34:44.352
Just hold on a second.

34:44.936 --> 34:48.314
Why are we here? I don't see
how the four of us can do anything.

34:49.190 --> 34:50.233
I mean, how...

34:50.817 --> 34:53.486
They don't honestly expect us
to fight that thing in this.

34:53.486 --> 34:54.779
They obviously do.

34:55.321 --> 34:58.616
[Mizushima] What? We don't
stand a chance! Not against that!

34:58.616 --> 35:00.827
A big US cruiser couldn't take it down.

35:00.827 --> 35:03.371
We're a couple of planks of wood.
How are we gonna do anything?!

35:03.371 --> 35:05.206
We can distract it for a while.

35:06.415 --> 35:07.416
Are you joking?

35:07.959 --> 35:10.711
Singapore's sending us
the Takao from their docks.

35:11.504 --> 35:13.548
Huh? Wait. As in the heavy cruiser?

35:13.548 --> 35:17.009
Instead of scuttling it there,
they're going to let us use it again.

35:17.802 --> 35:20.388
Well, then, that's great!
The Takao is huge!

35:20.388 --> 35:24.225
Our orders are to do whatever it takes
to stall for time until it gets here.

35:24.225 --> 35:27.603
That's an American destroyer.
How come they can't deal with this?

35:28.688 --> 35:31.983
I wouldn't count on it.
It's about enough of the Soviets as it is.

35:31.983 --> 35:35.027
The US risks furthering those tensions
if they do anything.

35:35.528 --> 35:38.698
For little things like this,
they'd rather us handle it on our own.

35:38.698 --> 35:40.241
I wouldn't call this little.

35:40.241 --> 35:42.577
And plus, all we've got is a 13 mm gun.

35:42.577 --> 35:46.205
Which is exactly why they said
we should use a few mines we've recovered.

35:46.831 --> 35:51.169
Aha! That's why
we're the ones that got called out here.

35:51.169 --> 35:52.128
Of course.

35:52.128 --> 35:55.464
They needed a team that could
scavenge their own weapons locally.

35:55.464 --> 35:59.635
They also ordered us not to tell anyone
about the creature or what we're doing.

35:59.635 --> 36:03.139
[Akitsu] And there it is.
Their favorite, the gag order.

36:04.432 --> 36:06.142
This country never changes.

36:07.602 --> 36:08.811
I wonder if it can.

36:18.487 --> 36:20.907
All right, it's my turn. Here.

36:22.658 --> 36:23.659
Thank you.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.163
Try not to push yourself too hard,
Shiki-san.

36:27.705 --> 36:30.666
I know. I can't help it
if this really is Godzilla.

36:32.460 --> 36:33.628
I know the feeling.

36:34.503 --> 36:37.423
When I think about
the things that happened in the war,

36:38.466 --> 36:40.176
I have a hard time sleeping.

36:41.636 --> 36:43.012
I have to avenge them.

36:43.930 --> 36:45.181
But then I remember

36:46.474 --> 36:48.517
how terrifying that thing was.

36:54.774 --> 36:58.611
We only have a pair of those,
one of which is for an emergency.

37:00.655 --> 37:02.406
[water plopping]

37:04.575 --> 37:05.993
Oh. What's the matter?

37:07.119 --> 37:09.372
[water plopping]

37:24.095 --> 37:25.346
Look at that.

37:26.055 --> 37:28.724
There's way more fish
than there was back on Odo.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.435
[breathing rapidly]

37:31.936 --> 37:34.105
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

37:34.689 --> 37:36.148
Godzilla's gotta be close!

37:36.148 --> 37:37.775
Sound the alarm!

37:39.610 --> 37:41.237
[Akitsu] So it's coming, huh?

37:42.113 --> 37:44.573
Hey, Kid! Get ready
to drop those mines in, all right?

37:44.573 --> 37:46.492
- [Mizushima] Roger!
- Shikishima! Get on the gun!

37:46.492 --> 37:49.287
We should retreat. We don't stand
a chance fighting it like this.

37:49.287 --> 37:51.956
- If we leave now, we'll make it.
- We should see how it acts first.

37:51.956 --> 37:53.958
Doc, go stand aft
and call out anything you see.

37:53.958 --> 37:56.669
- Captain, please!
- Hey, Kaishinmaru. You fellas copy?

37:57.169 --> 38:00.131
They say it's gonna show soon.
Get ready to land the big one.

38:00.131 --> 38:03.217
[man on radio] <i>Roger that.
Hope you don't mind us taking the credit.</i>

38:03.217 --> 38:04.593
- Like hell.
- We need to go!

38:04.593 --> 38:07.471
If we run now,
the Takao won't make it in time.

38:07.471 --> 38:10.182
After that, where do you think
this thing's gonna go?

38:11.350 --> 38:14.061
I don't wanna see Tokyo
in a sea of fire again.

38:14.061 --> 38:16.480
Listen. There's no way
our ship can handle it!

38:16.480 --> 38:19.233
I thought you said you hated
the government telling you what to do!

38:19.233 --> 38:21.068
Yeah, this doesn't change that!

38:21.610 --> 38:22.611
The thing is,

38:23.362 --> 38:25.573
if we don't step up,
who the hell's going to?

38:27.074 --> 38:28.868
[booming in distance]

38:29.869 --> 38:30.995
[alarms sounding]

38:31.954 --> 38:33.664
[men screaming]

38:37.209 --> 38:38.961
[breathing heavily]

38:42.506 --> 38:44.800
Actually, let the Takao handle this one.

38:49.305 --> 38:50.639
Hey, Doc, the engine!

38:50.639 --> 38:52.016
I'm doing my best!

38:52.641 --> 38:53.893
[Mizushima] Shikishima!

38:55.478 --> 38:56.937
- Shikishima!
- Coming!

38:56.937 --> 38:58.939
[Mizushima] Hurry! Help me with this!

39:00.900 --> 39:03.361
- Captain!
- [Akitsu] Yeah, I see it!

39:03.361 --> 39:05.363
- Full throttle ahead!
- Got it!

39:05.363 --> 39:06.280
[grunts]

39:06.280 --> 39:07.448
[engine chugging]

39:16.540 --> 39:18.501
[Mizushima grunting]

39:26.175 --> 39:27.968
Get it in the water, now!

39:29.136 --> 39:31.013
It's too close.
There's no way we'll make it!

39:31.013 --> 39:33.224
Just drop the goddamn mine, Doc!

39:34.100 --> 39:36.185
[strained grunting]

39:37.144 --> 39:39.146
[tense suspenseful music playing]

39:52.743 --> 39:54.203
All right, Kid! Hit it!

39:54.203 --> 39:56.122
Blowing the mine! [grunts]

39:59.500 --> 40:00.793
[all yelp]

40:01.919 --> 40:03.087
Is it dead?

40:06.340 --> 40:08.426
[Godzilla growling angrily]

40:08.426 --> 40:10.803
It's still on our tail!

40:10.803 --> 40:13.180
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man!
I'm gonna die!

40:13.180 --> 40:15.015
Shikishima, the gun!

40:15.015 --> 40:16.559
- Roger!
- [Mizushima whimpers]

40:16.559 --> 40:19.061

- [grunting]
- [gunfire]

40:28.737 --> 40:30.573
[Shikishima yelling]

40:36.203 --> 40:38.289
Damn it! It didn't do anything!

40:38.289 --> 40:40.207
[Godzilla growling]

40:42.209 --> 40:45.171
I have an idea.
What if we hit it in the mouth?

40:46.172 --> 40:47.298
[Shikishima grunts]

40:47.298 --> 40:50.759
[Noda] Reel, reel, reel! Hurry!
Quick! Get the line ready!

40:51.760 --> 40:53.762
Drop it! [grunting]

41:00.144 --> 41:02.563
Mizushima! Hit the switch!

41:02.563 --> 41:03.522
[yelling]

- [grunts]
- [silence]

[confused grunt]

41:07.651 --> 41:10.196
[Godzilla snarling]

41:12.490 --> 41:13.491
Hey!

41:14.116 --> 41:15.117
What's wrong?

41:15.743 --> 41:16.577
You're kidding!

41:17.161 --> 41:18.746
[Godzilla growling]

41:27.213 --> 41:28.255
[mine clinks]

41:28.756 --> 41:30.549
[Shikishima] You two, get down!

42:29.692 --> 42:32.486
- [Akitsu] It's the Takao!
- [Noda] They made it.

[Noda panting, grunting]

42:46.041 --> 42:48.043
[unsettling music playing]

Wait. What's it doing?

43:39.887 --> 43:40.888
Did we kill it?

43:41.388 --> 43:43.098
[suspenseful music building]

43:44.808 --> 43:46.477
[Noda breathing heavily]

43:52.399 --> 43:53.233
What's that?

44:00.866 --> 44:02.493
[shocked panting]

44:05.454 --> 44:07.247
[ominous music playing]

44:12.002 --> 44:15.047

44:37.903 --> 44:39.113
[silence]

44:49.039 --> 44:50.582
[exhales slowly]

44:54.336 --> 44:55.796
Good. You're finally awake.

44:58.006 --> 44:59.007
Where am I?

44:59.967 --> 45:03.178
Yokosuka Hospital.
They rescued us after the attack.

45:04.847 --> 45:07.850
The Kaishinmaru and Takao crews,
did they make it?

45:13.147 --> 45:15.232
Oh. Godzilla...

45:16.233 --> 45:17.234
- That's right.
- Easy.

45:17.234 --> 45:18.902
Where did it go? What happened?

45:18.902 --> 45:21.655
It disappeared. No one knows where it is.

45:21.655 --> 45:23.824
Godzilla was headed straight
for the mainland.

45:23.824 --> 45:25.951
We need to evacuate everyone,
or this is going to be--

45:25.951 --> 45:29.580
Not so fast. The country
has decided not to tell the public.

45:29.580 --> 45:31.915
Why wouldn't they tell everyone
they're in danger?

45:31.915 --> 45:34.752
Because they don't want
things to get out of control.

45:34.752 --> 45:37.045
There's no time
to worry about any of that.

45:37.045 --> 45:38.797
We need to begin evacuating now,
otherwise--

45:38.797 --> 45:41.550
I understand what you're saying,
and I agree with you.

45:42.176 --> 45:43.510
But they don't want chaos.

45:43.510 --> 45:46.597
Information control is the only thing
this country's good at.

45:55.522 --> 45:57.608
I want to know what's going on with you.

45:59.151 --> 46:01.820
Noriko, I'm fine.
It's got nothing to do with you.

46:03.989 --> 46:06.450
Tell me what this thing is
that's tormenting you.

46:09.161 --> 46:12.956
Ever since you took me in,
we've built a life together.

46:13.749 --> 46:17.461
But even through all of that,
you never really let me into your life.

46:24.885 --> 46:26.970
I know it has to be a heavy burden.

46:28.430 --> 46:30.682
I wish you'd let me help you carry it.

46:42.611 --> 46:43.695
During the war...

46:46.073 --> 46:47.074
I was...

46:50.994 --> 46:52.037
[sighs]

46:57.543 --> 46:58.710
In the war...

47:03.465 --> 47:04.842
I was a kamikaze.

47:06.552 --> 47:07.386
What?

47:08.178 --> 47:09.596
The day I was sent out...

47:12.599 --> 47:15.018
I pretended there was
an issue with my fighter.

47:17.229 --> 47:18.730
So I flew to an island

47:20.232 --> 47:21.608
and landed for repairs.

47:35.122 --> 47:36.206
These photos,

47:37.916 --> 47:41.295
they... they belonged
to the mechanics there.

47:44.339 --> 47:47.175
That day, they all died.

48:01.607 --> 48:02.649
During the night,

48:04.484 --> 48:07.529
a giant monster,
like a dinosaur, came ashore.

48:11.533 --> 48:12.492
They asked me

48:13.619 --> 48:16.121
to shoot at it with the gun on my fighter.

48:19.499 --> 48:20.584
But I froze.

48:26.256 --> 48:27.549
I just ran away again.

48:29.676 --> 48:32.262
I let them die. It was all my fault.

48:33.805 --> 48:35.724
I let that thing kill everyone.

48:35.724 --> 48:38.226
They were going to return home
to their families!

48:43.649 --> 48:44.608
The monster...

48:47.319 --> 48:49.112
Godzilla, that was its name.

48:53.742 --> 48:56.411
The other day, I saw it again.

48:59.456 --> 49:00.958
And just like back then...

49:03.669 --> 49:05.462
I couldn't do anything to stop it.

49:08.382 --> 49:09.341
[breathing shakily]

49:15.472 --> 49:16.848
I don't deserve this.

49:18.934 --> 49:20.811
Why should I get the chance to live?

49:27.818 --> 49:28.902
Koichi.

49:31.655 --> 49:35.867
Everyone who survived the war,
they all deserve to have a life again.

49:35.867 --> 49:37.828
Oh yeah? And how would you know that?

49:37.828 --> 49:39.079
Because of my parents!

49:40.122 --> 49:43.917
As they died in the fire, they called out
and said they wanted me to live.

49:44.793 --> 49:48.630
Whatever happens, whatever I do,
I know that I have to survive.

49:50.257 --> 49:52.009
It's what keeps me going.

50:04.396 --> 50:05.397
I can't.

50:05.397 --> 50:07.149
[shuddering breaths]

50:08.567 --> 50:12.029
Every night, I hear them
calling to me in my dreams.

50:12.946 --> 50:14.906
"Come and join us already," they say.

50:15.699 --> 50:18.702
"Stop trying to cheat death
and accept your fate."

50:19.202 --> 50:22.998
Those are just nightmares.
Illusions that you created for yourself--

50:22.998 --> 50:25.333
Sometimes... sometimes I wonder...

50:26.668 --> 50:29.254
I wonder... if I'm still alive.

50:31.715 --> 50:33.467
What if I did die on that island,

50:34.176 --> 50:35.427
and I'm rotting there?

50:36.428 --> 50:39.306
You... What if you and Akiko...

50:39.306 --> 50:43.143
What if the two of you are just
the final dreams of a dead man?

50:43.143 --> 50:45.395
That's it! It has to be! I know it!

50:45.395 --> 50:47.564
- You are alive!
- [sobbing]

50:51.485 --> 50:54.112
- You're alive, Koichi.
- [sobbing]

50:57.574 --> 50:59.034
Why can't you feel that?

51:00.327 --> 51:02.120
[Shikishima sobbing]

51:13.215 --> 51:15.759
[Noriko] Okay. Hold the spoon.

51:16.676 --> 51:19.262
See. Gently, gently.

51:20.013 --> 51:21.973
- Be patient.
- [Akiko] Okay.

51:22.974 --> 51:25.644
- [Noriko] Good. Now stir the broth.
- [Akiko] Mm-hmm.

51:25.644 --> 51:27.145
[Noriko] You're doing great.

51:28.480 --> 51:31.358
- There, it's done!
- [Akiko] Yay!

51:32.651 --> 51:35.195
And look, I added your favorite, daikon.

51:35.195 --> 51:37.572
- [Akiko] Daikon!
- Let me know how it tastes.

51:37.572 --> 51:39.825
- [Akiko] Okay.
- You ready for a sip?

51:42.202 --> 51:44.746
First the soup, then the daikon.

51:46.373 --> 51:48.333
- [Akiko] I like it.
- [Noriko] Is it hot?

51:48.917 --> 51:50.919
- Don't burn your tongue.
- [Akiko] Mm-hmm.

51:51.837 --> 51:53.797
[Noriko] Have another bite. How is it?

51:53.797 --> 51:55.298
- [Akiko] Mmm!
- [Noriko chuckles]

51:55.298 --> 51:57.342
- [Akiko] It's yummy.
- [Noriko] You like it?

51:57.342 --> 51:58.552
Am I really...

52:00.971 --> 52:02.764
allowed to dream again now?

52:09.938 --> 52:11.815
Can I finally live my life?

52:24.786 --> 52:26.121
[unsettling music playing]

52:26.121 --> 52:27.706
[startled gasping]

52:30.959 --> 52:33.378
Whoa. Is that it?

52:34.588 --> 52:36.173
Hey. Go call it in.

52:37.591 --> 52:40.135
- Hurry! Go!
- Yes, sir!

52:44.097 --> 52:45.807
[tense music playing]

53:00.989 --> 53:02.908
We just heard from an offshore patrol.

53:02.908 --> 53:05.452
A giant creature
is heading toward Tokyo Bay.

53:06.036 --> 53:07.704
Then it should be here soon.

53:09.039 --> 53:10.874
- [gasps]
- [man 1] What is it?

53:10.874 --> 53:13.210
- I don't believe it.
- You see something?

53:13.835 --> 53:16.588
Look at it. Have you ever
seen anything like that?

53:18.381 --> 53:21.301
This is Tokyo Bay Defense.
Preparing to detonate zone four.

53:21.301 --> 53:24.095
We'll try to block the creature
from going any further.

53:24.095 --> 53:26.181
It's closing in. Almost there!

53:27.766 --> 53:29.267
[unsettling music playing]

53:30.393 --> 53:31.937
Breaching zone four now!

53:33.104 --> 53:34.522
- There it is!
- Detonate!

53:37.776 --> 53:38.610
That get it?

53:39.819 --> 53:42.197
No good. The mines didn't damage it!

53:42.948 --> 53:44.449
Tokyo Bay blockade breached!

53:44.449 --> 53:46.451
The monster is now heading
towards Shinagawa!

53:46.451 --> 53:48.536
And it's gargantuan!

53:49.913 --> 53:51.122
[Godzilla growls softly]

53:51.122 --> 53:53.166
- Oh. Oh!
- [jaunty music playing]

53:54.334 --> 53:55.835
Ah. Thank you.

53:57.045 --> 53:59.464
[air-raid siren blaring]

54:01.549 --> 54:04.386
[chiming on radio]

[man on radio] <i>This is
an emergency news broadcast.</i>

<i>A giant creature has come ashore
at Tokyo Bay</i>

54:14.896 --> 54:16.773

<i>follow police instructions
and evacuate right away.</i>

54:21.486 --> 54:23.113
<i>This is not a hoax.</i>

Here, come with me!

- Hey, what's going on?

55:09.075 --> 55:11.661
- [woman 2] Why did we stop?
- [thundering footstep]

55:30.764 --> 55:31.765
...Godzilla?

[whimpering fearfully]

56:42.585 --> 56:43.545

56:49.843 --> 56:52.303
What we're witnessing
is a scene beyond belief.

56:52.303 --> 56:55.348
We can only watch
as the massive creature destroys our city!

56:55.348 --> 56:58.143
Each step it takes,
Ginza is crushed in its path.

56:59.310 --> 57:02.355
And now it's begun
tearing apart the Nippon Theater!

57:02.355 --> 57:04.941
The theater,
once a beloved icon of the people,

57:04.941 --> 57:06.651
razed in mere moments.

57:06.651 --> 57:09.154
All of this, right before our very eyes!

57:09.863 --> 57:10.697
[scared yelping]

57:10.697 --> 57:12.031
It's truly unbelievable.

57:12.031 --> 57:15.326
The district that survived
catastrophic air raids during the war

57:15.326 --> 57:17.579
has been reduced
to little more than rubble.

57:17.579 --> 57:21.124
Ah! And now the monster!
It's approaching our position!

57:21.124 --> 57:22.500
As it moves closer,

57:22.500 --> 57:26.796
we can only stand back and watch
as its enormous head towers above us!

57:26.796 --> 57:29.674
This could be the end!
It isn't safe for us to be here!

01:03:22.902 --> 01:03:28.032
Remember, you're going to stay
at my house when Dad's away, okay?

01:03:28.032 --> 01:03:30.618
When do I get to see Mom?

01:03:36.123 --> 01:03:37.708
Mm. Not right now.

01:03:38.876 --> 01:03:41.838
She had to go away
for a little while for work.

01:03:42.463 --> 01:03:44.465
So you'll be with your auntie for a bit.

01:03:45.925 --> 01:03:47.552
[Akiko crying]

01:03:56.477 --> 01:03:59.063
[Sumiko] Oh, Akiko. Come here, sweetheart.

01:03:59.063 --> 01:04:00.189
It's okay.

01:04:01.899 --> 01:04:03.025
It'll be all right.

01:04:03.651 --> 01:04:04.735
Come here.

01:04:05.403 --> 01:04:06.445
It's okay.

01:04:06.445 --> 01:04:08.030
[Akiko continues crying]

01:04:31.929 --> 01:04:34.849
It's what I get, isn't it?
For what I did to you.

01:04:41.689 --> 01:04:42.565
Of course.

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:46.736
Why did I think I could dream again?

01:04:51.365 --> 01:04:52.241
[chuckles wryly]

01:05:01.626 --> 01:05:02.585
Shiki-san.

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.504
Listen to me.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:10.051
I'm part of a secret effort
to design a strategy to defeat Godzilla

01:05:11.677 --> 01:05:13.304
led by a civilian force.

01:05:14.472 --> 01:05:16.807
While I still don't know how viable it is...

01:05:20.186 --> 01:05:21.562
I'd like you to be there.

01:05:28.277 --> 01:05:31.739
SPECIAL DISASTER COUNTERMEASURE HEARING

01:05:31.739 --> 01:05:33.658
[indistinct background chatter]

01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:39.830
Look at all these guys.
Is everybody here--

01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:42.333
Yes. They're all ex-navy personnel.

01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:43.417
Is that so?

01:05:43.918 --> 01:05:44.877
No kidding.

01:06:03.646 --> 01:06:05.815
My name is Hotta.

01:06:05.815 --> 01:06:08.150
I was the captain of the Yukikaze.

01:06:08.693 --> 01:06:10.569
Thank you all for coming today.

01:06:10.569 --> 01:06:14.532
As you're all aware,
Tokyo is facing an unprecedented threat.

01:06:14.532 --> 01:06:16.617
A powerful creature so enormous

01:06:16.617 --> 01:06:19.161
that it can level an entire city.

01:06:19.161 --> 01:06:21.664
But we lack defensive forces of our own.

01:06:22.289 --> 01:06:25.084
Any GHQ intervention runs the risk

01:06:25.084 --> 01:06:27.670
of further escalating US-Soviet tensions.

01:06:28.254 --> 01:06:29.714
No one is coming to help us.

01:06:29.714 --> 01:06:30.673
[muttering]

01:06:30.673 --> 01:06:31.799
[Hotta] In short,

01:06:31.799 --> 01:06:34.176
the only option is
to confront this monster,

01:06:34.176 --> 01:06:36.512
uniting our strengths as private citizens.

01:06:36.512 --> 01:06:37.763
[disbelieving chatter]

01:06:37.763 --> 01:06:40.516
[Hotta] That is why
we've gathered you all here today.

01:06:41.017 --> 01:06:44.729
Fortunately, after rounds of negotiations,

01:06:44.729 --> 01:06:47.898
we secured four destroyers
slated for handover to the UN.

01:06:48.399 --> 01:06:50.901
- Are you kidding?
- What are you saying?

01:06:51.819 --> 01:06:53.946
That you want us
to get back on navy ships?

01:06:53.946 --> 01:06:56.699
Just look at Ginza
and what happened there.

01:06:56.699 --> 01:06:58.743
There's nothing we can do to beat that.

01:06:58.743 --> 01:07:02.872
Aren't those boats all disarmed?
What are you expecting us to do?

01:07:02.872 --> 01:07:04.999
- That's right! You're dreaming!
- This is insane!

01:07:04.999 --> 01:07:08.502
Could you please calm down?
That's exactly what I'm here to explain.

01:07:09.086 --> 01:07:10.296
Noda-san?

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.507
- I would like to--
- [microphone feedback]

01:07:15.301 --> 01:07:16.385
Uh, sorry.

01:07:17.595 --> 01:07:19.555
I'd like to start with an introduction.

01:07:19.555 --> 01:07:22.558
My name is Kenji Noda,
and I was a navy technical officer.

01:07:22.558 --> 01:07:24.769
What we know about this monster is,

01:07:25.394 --> 01:07:28.647
uh, the local people of Odo Island
call it Godzilla,

01:07:28.647 --> 01:07:30.232
which is how I'll refer to it.

01:07:30.232 --> 01:07:33.903
This creature is virtually immune
to all types of conventional weaponry.

01:07:33.903 --> 01:07:35.321
I witnessed it firsthand.

01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:37.990
As soon as the Takao hit it
with its heavy cannons,

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:41.327
Godzilla began
regenerating itself back to health.

01:07:41.911 --> 01:07:43.954
What can we do against a thing like that?

01:07:43.954 --> 01:07:45.372
Quiet, please.

01:07:45.372 --> 01:07:48.000
Our plan will instead
use the unconventional.

01:07:50.336 --> 01:07:52.838
Please, allow us to show you what I mean.

01:07:52.838 --> 01:07:56.217
The water in this tank
has the same salinity as seawater.

01:07:56.717 --> 01:07:58.928
There's a wooden Godzilla
model on the surface,

01:07:58.928 --> 01:08:01.889
which you can see we've weighed down
just enough to float at the top.

01:08:01.889 --> 01:08:03.599
If we were to pipe in Freon gas,

01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:06.769
what would happen
once the model is enveloped in bubbles?

01:08:06.769 --> 01:08:08.687
Oh, now that's an easy one.

01:08:08.687 --> 01:08:10.898
It'll stay afloat, even with the bubbles.

01:08:10.898 --> 01:08:13.484
- What else could it do?
- [man 2] Yeah, it'll float!

01:08:13.484 --> 01:08:15.277
Yes, that's what you would think.

01:08:18.572 --> 01:08:19.782
[gas hissing]

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.452
- [man 3] Oh God.
- [man 4] It sank!

01:08:23.452 --> 01:08:25.371
- [man 5] It did?
- [man 6] Yeah.

01:08:25.371 --> 01:08:27.665
The Freon bubbles
surround the wooden model,

01:08:27.665 --> 01:08:29.959
which prevents any contact with seawater.

01:08:29.959 --> 01:08:32.670
The idea is
to trap the real Godzilla just like this

01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:35.506
and forcefully sink the creature
to the bottom of the ocean.

01:08:35.506 --> 01:08:39.969
Hey. Looks like the Doc carries
a lot of influence around here, huh?

01:08:39.969 --> 01:08:40.886
Uh-huh.

01:08:40.886 --> 01:08:42.888
[men chattering indistinctly]

01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:55.401
Now, as you're all aware,

01:08:55.401 --> 01:08:58.070
the Sagami Trench
is over 1,500 meters deep,

01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:01.240
making it the single deepest point
in nearby waters.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.324
And so my plan

01:09:02.324 --> 01:09:05.244
is to attach our Freon gas cylinders
directly to Godzilla

01:09:05.244 --> 01:09:06.704
and fire them all at once,

01:09:06.704 --> 01:09:08.789
surrounding it
in a bubble membrane like you saw.

01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:12.042
The idea is that it will sink
to the bottom of the trench so rapidly,

01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:13.544
the pressure will crush it to death.

01:09:13.544 --> 01:09:15.254
[men chattering indistinctly]

01:09:16.881 --> 01:09:19.133
We kill it with the power of the ocean.

01:09:20.176 --> 01:09:23.721
I call it... Special Operation Wada Tsumi.

01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:24.889
[man 7] "Wada Tsumi"?

01:09:24.889 --> 01:09:28.767
Couldn't it withstand the pressure
if it's already used to living in the sea?

01:09:28.767 --> 01:09:29.894
[man 8] Yeah!

01:09:29.894 --> 01:09:33.230
The calculations show
that after 25 seconds,

01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:36.650
every square meter
should apply 1,500 tons of pressure.

01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:39.069
Even a creature
that's used to living in deep water

01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:42.156
would be extremely unlikely
to survive that kind of pressure.

01:09:42.156 --> 01:09:43.657
I have a question.

01:09:44.158 --> 01:09:46.452
Can you guarantee this will kill Godzilla?

01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:51.665
Godzilla is a creature
about which we know very little.

01:09:52.333 --> 01:09:54.460
So theory has to drive our strategy.

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.586
[dismissive chatter]

01:09:55.586 --> 01:09:58.380
- [man 9] You call that a plan?
- [man 10] What if it doesn't work?

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.217
Guns can't hurt it, as I've said,
so we think this is our--

01:10:01.217 --> 01:10:03.344
Just tell us if this will kill it or not.

01:10:06.388 --> 01:10:07.890
I can't guarantee that.

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:09.892
[disappointed murmuring]

01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:11.685
Shikishima!

01:10:12.269 --> 01:10:13.687
This is our best shot!

01:10:13.687 --> 01:10:15.272
[pensive music playing]

01:10:18.442 --> 01:10:19.568
Shiki-san.

01:10:21.612 --> 01:10:23.113
Just hear me out, all right?

01:10:23.113 --> 01:10:24.448
[pensive music continues]

01:10:40.381 --> 01:10:42.925
Now, then. Here is step one.

01:10:48.138 --> 01:10:51.976
Two destroyers will corral Godzilla
and wrap it in a cable like this.

01:10:53.018 --> 01:10:55.896
Running along the cable
will be various points

01:10:55.896 --> 01:10:58.607
that have Freon gas cylinders
attached to them.

01:11:01.026 --> 01:11:04.488
Once it's wrapped tightly,
the gas can then be released.

01:11:05.572 --> 01:11:09.743
This will force Godzilla
to rapidly plunge down 1,500 meters.

01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:11.495
If it doesn't work, what happens?

01:11:11.495 --> 01:11:13.163
There's a contingency for that.

01:11:13.163 --> 01:11:14.373
[men muttering]

01:11:14.373 --> 01:11:17.418
Gentlemen,
would you look into the courtyard?

01:11:24.842 --> 01:11:26.510
[suspenseful music playing]

01:11:34.935 --> 01:11:37.104
- [suspenseful music intensifies]
- Inflate!

01:11:37.855 --> 01:11:39.189
[men] Whoa!

01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:41.650
- [impressed muttering]
- [man 10] That was crazy!

01:11:42.443 --> 01:11:46.697
Hello, I'm Itagaki from Toyo Balloon.
Let me explain what you just saw.

01:11:46.697 --> 01:11:50.659
For this design, we chose
to look at the life rafts used in the war.

01:11:50.659 --> 01:11:52.828
It's an inflatable flotation device.

01:11:52.828 --> 01:11:56.290
CO2 is shot at high velocity
into air sacs for buoyancy.

01:11:56.290 --> 01:11:58.375
Think of it like a life preserver.

01:11:59.835 --> 01:12:01.754
Once Godzilla hits the bottom,

01:12:01.754 --> 01:12:05.466
the device is inflated,
forcing it right back up to the surface.

01:12:05.466 --> 01:12:08.052
Even if it does
initially withstand the pressure,

01:12:08.052 --> 01:12:11.680
in these conditions, it's highly unlikely
to survive decompression.

01:12:12.264 --> 01:12:15.934
Even so, I can't tell you
that this will work with total certainty.

01:12:16.727 --> 01:12:19.021
But I think this is gonna be
our only real chance.

01:12:19.021 --> 01:12:20.814
[hesitant murmuring]

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.612
I doubt that any of us want to be here.

01:12:27.237 --> 01:12:30.366
Putting your lives on the line
after already surviving a war.

01:12:30.366 --> 01:12:32.076
I know how unfair it sounds.

01:12:32.076 --> 01:12:34.661
And yet, we need your help.

01:12:35.287 --> 01:12:38.290
We're in this alone.
No aid from any government.

01:12:39.083 --> 01:12:42.378
Which means the future of this nation
is in your hands again.

01:12:43.128 --> 01:12:44.546
[music fades]

01:12:45.381 --> 01:12:46.465
I can't, sir.

01:12:48.425 --> 01:12:50.427
It's too much. I have a family.

01:12:50.427 --> 01:12:53.430
Everyone here does.
Why do we have to risk our lives again?

01:12:54.139 --> 01:12:57.810
Why does it have to be us? We're always
the ones drawing the short straw.

01:12:59.353 --> 01:13:01.772
We can't go back
to the things we were doing in the war.

01:13:01.772 --> 01:13:03.690
[men chattering indistinctly]

01:13:04.817 --> 01:13:06.568
[all calling out hesitations]

01:13:07.986 --> 01:13:09.238
[Hotta] Quiet, please.

01:13:09.238 --> 01:13:11.949
Please. Listen carefully.

01:13:13.033 --> 01:13:14.535
We aren't conscripting you.

01:13:15.119 --> 01:13:18.539
If you don't want to volunteer for this,
go back to your families.

01:13:19.164 --> 01:13:22.292
None of us have the right
to stop any of you.

01:13:26.588 --> 01:13:28.048
- [man 11] Hey.
- [man 12] What?

01:13:28.048 --> 01:13:29.466
[man 13] He's gonna leave?

01:13:29.466 --> 01:13:30.592
Hold on.

01:13:30.592 --> 01:13:31.677
[man 14] Excuse me.

01:13:33.303 --> 01:13:34.555
[indistinct muttering]

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:37.391
[man 15] I'm sorry, sir.

01:13:44.273 --> 01:13:46.442
[murmuring dies down]

01:13:46.442 --> 01:13:47.901
[man 16] I have a question.

01:13:49.278 --> 01:13:51.321
Does this plan of yours
mean certain death?

01:13:52.239 --> 01:13:53.740
Of course it doesn't.

01:13:56.118 --> 01:13:59.204
Okay. Well, those odds
are better than the war.

01:13:59.204 --> 01:14:00.956
[laughter]

01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:04.126
[man 16] Someone has to do it, right?

01:14:05.002 --> 01:14:06.753
Who else is gonna get this done?

01:14:06.753 --> 01:14:09.465
We need these ships,
and that means we need sailors.

01:14:09.465 --> 01:14:11.717
- [man 17] Yeah.
- [man 18] That's true.

01:14:11.717 --> 01:14:14.845
What do you say? Are we in, boys?

01:14:14.845 --> 01:14:17.598
[men shouting] Yes! Yes! Yeah!

01:14:17.598 --> 01:14:18.765
[man 19] Sure am!

01:14:18.765 --> 01:14:20.434
[man 20] Let's do it! Come on!

01:14:20.434 --> 01:14:21.894
- Let's go!
- Let's do it!

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.980
- [man 21] We can do it!
- My friends.

01:14:27.483 --> 01:14:28.317
Thank you.

01:14:28.817 --> 01:14:30.319
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:14:30.319 --> 01:14:31.570
Hear, hear!

01:14:33.947 --> 01:14:35.407
[applause continues]

01:14:38.202 --> 01:14:39.953
That was a surprise,

01:14:39.953 --> 01:14:43.290
finding out our good ol' Doc
was the one behind this crazy plan.

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:46.793
[chuckling] Well, I've had
a direct encounter with Godzilla.

01:14:46.793 --> 01:14:49.588
Because of that,
they suggested that I take the lead.

01:14:49.588 --> 01:14:53.050
Ah, that makes sense. That's why
they wanted us there too, isn't it?

01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:56.136
So, you think Godzilla will return?

01:14:57.304 --> 01:14:59.139
After that last attack,

01:14:59.139 --> 01:15:02.059
we can assume
that Godzilla has added Tokyo

01:15:02.059 --> 01:15:03.810
to its new "territory" of sorts.

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:06.647
Which would mean, in the worst case,

01:15:06.647 --> 01:15:08.440
it could return within ten days.

01:15:08.941 --> 01:15:10.108
You think that soon?

01:15:10.108 --> 01:15:13.111
I heard you set up
radiation-detecting buoys all over.

01:15:13.111 --> 01:15:16.198
We can't just rely on our sight
to figure out where it is.

01:15:16.198 --> 01:15:17.574
Yeah, still, though,

01:15:17.574 --> 01:15:20.786
you really think it's gonna walk
into your trap just like that?

01:15:21.286 --> 01:15:23.372
- Well, that's the thing.
- What, you don't have a plan?

01:15:23.372 --> 01:15:26.917
Well, yes, of course I do.
Who do you think you're dealing with?

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:32.589
We have underwater speakers
used for acoustic minesweeping.

01:15:32.589 --> 01:15:34.174
We use the speakers to play

01:15:34.174 --> 01:15:37.386
the recordings made of Godzilla's voice
during its last attack.

01:15:37.386 --> 01:15:38.971
- Godzilla's voice?
- Yeah.

01:15:39.471 --> 01:15:40.639
So it'll show up

01:15:40.639 --> 01:15:43.934
thinking it has another
territorial competitor to deal with.

01:15:44.726 --> 01:15:46.061
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully?!

01:15:46.603 --> 01:15:48.397
You can't just rely on hope.

01:15:48.397 --> 01:15:51.483
And what was
that... "flotation device" thing?

01:15:51.483 --> 01:15:54.570
I don't see how that'll work
on something as big as Godzilla.

01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:56.822
I'd like to see you
think of something else.

01:15:56.822 --> 01:16:00.242
I know! What about
pulling it up using the destroyers?

01:16:00.242 --> 01:16:01.827
You insane? They couldn't do that.

01:16:01.827 --> 01:16:05.747
Godzilla weighs around 20,000 tons.
That's far too heavy for two destroyers.

01:16:05.747 --> 01:16:07.332
Uh... Oh.

01:16:09.001 --> 01:16:12.337
In short, Doc, I think
your plan has a lot of holes in it.

01:16:12.963 --> 01:16:16.800
Well, if you're just gonna complain,
why don't you come up with a better one?

01:16:19.052 --> 01:16:20.178
[Shikishima] Noda-san.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:25.601
If I asked you for a fighter,
could you get me one?

01:16:26.476 --> 01:16:27.603
A fighter?

01:16:27.603 --> 01:16:29.646
If it does decide to come ashore,

01:16:29.646 --> 01:16:32.441
I think I could use my guns
to draw it out to the bay.

01:16:33.025 --> 01:16:35.986
But I thought all the Japanese fighters
were decommissioned after the war.

01:16:36.653 --> 01:16:39.990
Besides, even if I could,
it shoots out that heat ray as well.

01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:43.243
Flying so close to it like that,
you'd be risking your life.

01:16:43.243 --> 01:16:45.245
I don't care what the risks are!

01:16:45.245 --> 01:16:49.082
Besides, a good fighter is going to
outrun and outmaneuver any of our boats.

01:16:49.082 --> 01:16:50.792
Are you asking us to help you with this

01:16:50.792 --> 01:16:53.128
because you really think
it's going to work,

01:16:53.837 --> 01:16:55.464
or are you just trying to die?

01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:57.966
I think you're drunk.

01:16:58.592 --> 01:17:00.761
I think you just wanna avenge Noriko.

01:17:02.137 --> 01:17:03.263
What's so wrong with that?

01:17:03.263 --> 01:17:05.265
You waited too long.

01:17:07.351 --> 01:17:10.646
Why the hell didn't you marry that girl
when you had the chance?

01:17:11.271 --> 01:17:13.065
You knew how she felt, didn't you?

01:17:13.065 --> 01:17:15.525
Don't you think I also wanted that?

01:17:16.568 --> 01:17:18.862
Then why didn't you say anything to her?

01:17:20.989 --> 01:17:22.157
Because I couldn't.

01:17:28.997 --> 01:17:30.582
My war isn't over yet.

01:17:56.358 --> 01:17:57.984
Is it true? You found a plane?

01:17:57.984 --> 01:18:00.779
Yeah. However, it is a bit unique.

01:18:09.955 --> 01:18:11.415
[resolute music playing]

01:18:20.173 --> 01:18:22.426
[man] It was developed
at the end of the war.

01:18:22.426 --> 01:18:25.262
A short-range interceptor
known as the Shinden.

01:18:26.471 --> 01:18:28.974
Built to utilize fast hit-and-run tactics.

01:18:28.974 --> 01:18:31.560
It can hit speeds of over 400 knots.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.438
It's a canard design with four 30 mm guns.

01:18:35.021 --> 01:18:37.107
It can outmaneuver almost anything.

01:18:37.107 --> 01:18:39.776
A true marvel of aeronautical innovation.

01:18:40.902 --> 01:18:44.906
The fighters like this one here
were never deployed before the surrender.

01:18:45.407 --> 01:18:48.702
Towards the end of the war,
they were all kept here for storage.

01:18:48.702 --> 01:18:51.538
Until, eventually,
they were forgotten about entirely.

01:18:52.539 --> 01:18:56.418
Since then, they've just sat here to rust.
This one's in pretty bad shape.

01:18:57.753 --> 01:19:00.172
It's not airworthy. Not yet.

01:19:00.172 --> 01:19:03.300
Well, you see, that's the issue.
We need a top mechanic.

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:07.345
Or an engineer that really knows
their way around a fighter.

01:19:09.931 --> 01:19:13.226
Actually, I know just the person.

01:19:15.979 --> 01:19:18.899
Let's see.
An Ex-Odo Island detachment mechanic...

01:19:18.899 --> 01:19:21.359
- Sosaku Tachibana, you said?
- Right.

01:19:21.359 --> 01:19:24.404
Tachibana, Tachibana,
Tachibana, Tachibana, let's see.

01:19:24.404 --> 01:19:27.991
Ah. It looks like
we don't have a current address.

01:19:27.991 --> 01:19:29.409
[Shikishima] I understand.

01:19:29.409 --> 01:19:32.370
We're getting hit hard
with all sorts of requests like this.

01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:34.706
It could take quite a bit of time
for us to find anything.

01:19:34.706 --> 01:19:37.667
You don't understand.
I need to speak with him as soon as I can.

01:19:37.667 --> 01:19:40.587
That's too bad. Sorry.
I don't know what else I can do.

01:19:40.587 --> 01:19:41.630
- Sir, please!
- What?

01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:45.133
[Shikishima] I'm begging you!
The country's future depends on it!

01:19:45.133 --> 01:19:48.512
Oh, it does, I'm sure.
But I can't do the impossible.

01:19:48.512 --> 01:19:49.513
So sorry.

01:19:49.513 --> 01:19:50.847
Ah. Hold on.

01:19:51.473 --> 01:19:52.307
Uh, Tachibana.

01:19:52.307 --> 01:19:54.935
Do you know where he was posted
before he got to Odo Island?

01:19:54.935 --> 01:19:56.436
Can you at least tell me that?

01:19:56.937 --> 01:19:58.396
[resolute music continues]

01:20:03.902 --> 01:20:06.238
I've already asked everywhere I can.

01:20:06.238 --> 01:20:08.114
But this Tachibana fellow,

01:20:08.114 --> 01:20:10.534
he's proving to be
quite hard to track down.

01:20:11.409 --> 01:20:14.579
We can find someone else
to help us get the plane up in the air.

01:20:14.579 --> 01:20:16.289
Think. Do you have any other leads?

01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:18.124
Please just wait a little longer.

01:20:19.793 --> 01:20:22.462
I don't know why
you're being so insistent, Shiki-san.

01:20:22.462 --> 01:20:23.964
Godzilla could come back soon.

01:20:23.964 --> 01:20:26.508
- We can't be wasting--
- It's got to be Tachibana, all right?!

01:20:27.259 --> 01:20:29.719
I'm sure he'll get the message soon.
He has to.

01:20:30.679 --> 01:20:32.013
Wait for him, please.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:36.101
[music fades]

01:20:36.726 --> 01:20:37.811
[footsteps following]

01:20:43.316 --> 01:20:44.526
[both grunting]

01:20:52.659 --> 01:20:54.160
[gasping]

01:20:55.203 --> 01:20:57.706
[Shikishima breathing nervously]

01:20:58.623 --> 01:21:00.041
T... Tachibana?

01:21:01.877 --> 01:21:04.254
Tachibana-san! It really is you!

01:21:08.967 --> 01:21:10.927
What the hell are all these letters about?

01:21:13.763 --> 01:21:15.223
[Shikishima groans] Wait.

01:21:16.433 --> 01:21:18.143
[breathing shakily, grunts]

01:21:18.143 --> 01:21:20.312
The Odo Island massacre was my fault?

01:21:20.896 --> 01:21:22.689
I'm the one who let those men die?

01:21:24.733 --> 01:21:26.318
What are you talking about?

01:21:27.152 --> 01:21:28.153
I'm sorry.

01:21:28.987 --> 01:21:30.322
I needed you to find me.

01:21:30.822 --> 01:21:34.743
And sending those was the one thing
I knew would get under your skin.

01:21:34.743 --> 01:21:36.786
- [Tachibana] How dare you?!
- [grunts]

01:21:38.622 --> 01:21:40.457
The monster that attacked Ginza

01:21:41.291 --> 01:21:42.834
was the same one from Odo.

01:21:44.336 --> 01:21:45.462
It was Godzilla.

01:21:50.842 --> 01:21:53.178
[Shikishima groaning softly]

01:21:53.887 --> 01:21:55.096
We have a fighter.

01:21:55.764 --> 01:21:57.724
We're gonna use it to try and kill it.

01:21:57.724 --> 01:21:59.643
And I need your help to fix it.

01:22:00.685 --> 01:22:02.270
That's why I had to find you.

01:22:02.896 --> 01:22:05.315
We need a mechanic
who can get it ready to fly.

01:22:06.232 --> 01:22:08.443
That's why I wrote
all those stupid letters.

01:22:09.152 --> 01:22:10.236
[pained grunt]

01:22:10.236 --> 01:22:11.655
Please forgive me!

01:22:12.697 --> 01:22:14.616
[sobbing]

01:22:16.034 --> 01:22:17.202
[grunts]

01:22:17.202 --> 01:22:18.912
Forget it. You're on your own.

01:22:20.705 --> 01:22:22.123
Why would I ever help you?

01:22:22.832 --> 01:22:24.042
[Shikishima] Tachibana!

01:22:24.042 --> 01:22:26.002
Please, wait. Tachibana!

01:22:26.503 --> 01:22:27.379
Please don't go!

01:22:27.379 --> 01:22:30.882
Tachibana! I need you
to do something for me!

01:22:31.383 --> 01:22:35.220
Something... something I know
that only you can do.

01:22:36.888 --> 01:22:38.431
The Takao's guns did nothing,

01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:41.893
but I detonated a mine in its mouth,
and it actually hurt it.

01:22:41.893 --> 01:22:45.230
I think we can kill it if we find
a way to hit it from the inside!

01:22:47.023 --> 01:22:47.983
You mean...

01:22:49.567 --> 01:22:52.696
Put explosives in the rig
and fly directly into its mouth

01:22:52.696 --> 01:22:54.906
so we can finally kill it
once and for all.

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:03.039
A kamikaze.

01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:07.002
The war isn't over yet.

01:23:10.338 --> 01:23:12.132
Not for me or for you.

01:23:15.051 --> 01:23:16.469
Aah...

01:23:17.095 --> 01:23:19.514
- I thought you said you just fell down.
- Ah!

01:23:19.514 --> 01:23:22.642
You had to hit yourself pretty hard
for it to swell up that much.

01:23:22.642 --> 01:23:26.354
[chuckles] It's embarrassing.
I ended up getting pretty drunk.

01:23:26.354 --> 01:23:28.064
I barely remember anything.

01:23:28.606 --> 01:23:31.568
Well, considering you found Tachibana
after looking so hard,

01:23:31.568 --> 01:23:33.903
I think you deserved
to celebrate a little.

01:23:33.903 --> 01:23:36.489
- [Shikishima chuckles]
- [Tachibana] A canard, huh?

01:23:38.033 --> 01:23:40.535
I didn't think
that they had actually finished one.

01:23:42.912 --> 01:23:45.582
Tachibana-san. You made it.

01:23:45.582 --> 01:23:47.250
Thank you all for coming!

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:49.461
[Noda] Hello. You must be Mr. Tachibana.

01:23:52.881 --> 01:23:56.885
Look at that. Must be one
of the Shinden class interceptors, huh?

01:23:56.885 --> 01:24:00.388
Yes. This one wasn't finished.
You think you can make it fly?

01:24:03.558 --> 01:24:05.894
We'll do everything we can
to make that happen.

01:24:06.394 --> 01:24:07.729
We really appreciate it.

01:24:08.938 --> 01:24:09.939
Good luck.

01:24:10.607 --> 01:24:11.441
Good luck.

01:24:14.319 --> 01:24:17.155
- [purposeful music playing]
- [man] Move out! Move it out!

01:24:17.947 --> 01:24:18.782
Come on!

01:24:19.532 --> 01:24:20.450
Get it on!

01:24:21.826 --> 01:24:23.328
All right, let's pick it up!

01:24:23.912 --> 01:24:25.872
- Get those crates on now!
- Yes, sir!

01:24:26.539 --> 01:24:29.084
[man] Hey! Get moving, boys!

01:24:29.793 --> 01:24:30.794
What's wrong?

01:24:31.628 --> 01:24:34.839
You need to lighten up a little, Doc.
It ain't good for morale.

01:24:34.839 --> 01:24:36.966
I know that this was my idea, and yet,

01:24:36.966 --> 01:24:41.262
I still worry that for everything to work,
we'll need some kind of miracle to happen.

01:24:41.262 --> 01:24:42.764
I know you're worried.

01:24:42.764 --> 01:24:46.184
But to get a miracle,
you don't just stand by and wait for one.

01:24:46.184 --> 01:24:47.310
Yes, you're right.

01:24:48.186 --> 01:24:49.521
Take a look out there.

01:24:50.105 --> 01:24:51.356
These guys know.

01:24:52.649 --> 01:24:53.900
They aren't naive.

01:24:54.609 --> 01:24:57.862
They understand they're putting
their lives at risk to do this.

01:24:58.613 --> 01:24:59.447
And yet,

01:25:00.532 --> 01:25:01.741
their faces,

01:25:02.242 --> 01:25:03.993
they're bright and beaming.

01:25:04.661 --> 01:25:06.788
That's because they know this time,

01:25:06.788 --> 01:25:09.124
they have a chance
to make a real difference.

01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:12.252
A real difference? Ah.

01:25:14.045 --> 01:25:16.589
In the war,
we were used to suffering every day.

01:25:17.382 --> 01:25:18.383
But now,

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.802
we get to do good again.

01:25:28.017 --> 01:25:29.435
[beacon crackling]

01:25:32.981 --> 01:25:36.192
2F CONFERENCE ROOM 3
SPECIAL DISASTER COUNTERMEASURE HQ

01:25:36.192 --> 01:25:37.193
[man 1] Hurry up!

01:25:37.193 --> 01:25:38.444
[indistinct chattering]

01:25:40.488 --> 01:25:41.489
Make some room.

01:25:43.158 --> 01:25:44.284
This just came in.

01:25:44.909 --> 01:25:46.369
East of Hachijo Island.

01:25:47.078 --> 01:25:49.164
33.1 degrees north.

01:25:49.164 --> 01:25:51.166
140.01 degrees east.

01:25:51.166 --> 01:25:53.459
Geiger readings
from multiple detection buoys

01:25:53.459 --> 01:25:54.669
about an hour ago.

01:25:55.336 --> 01:25:56.379
Followed by

01:25:56.379 --> 01:25:58.548
here and here.

01:26:14.272 --> 01:26:15.940
[Noda] Godzilla is on its way.

01:26:16.858 --> 01:26:18.234
[man 2] It's happening.

01:26:18.234 --> 01:26:20.486
If it continues at this current rate,

01:26:20.486 --> 01:26:23.615
Godzilla is expected
to arrive at the Sagami Trench

01:26:23.615 --> 01:26:26.409
at approximately 1100 hours tomorrow.

01:26:26.409 --> 01:26:29.996
That means we need to leave port
right at 0800 hours.

01:26:29.996 --> 01:26:31.831
- [man 3] Mm.
- [men muttering]

01:26:32.582 --> 01:26:33.541
Itagaki.

01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:36.502
Your flotation device,
it'll be ready by then, right?

01:26:37.879 --> 01:26:39.923
We should be there on the destroyers.

01:26:39.923 --> 01:26:41.966
The final three hours will be critical.

01:26:42.467 --> 01:26:44.260
As engineers, we demand perfection.

01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:47.931
I can't ask that. You could get
caught up in our fight against Godzilla.

01:26:48.848 --> 01:26:50.767
The four of us have seen war too.

01:26:56.856 --> 01:26:59.776
Then, everyone, you should all go home.

01:26:59.776 --> 01:27:03.863
Spend as much time as you can
with your families tonight.

01:27:05.448 --> 01:27:07.575
Are you saying
that we should prepare them?

01:27:12.038 --> 01:27:13.248
We all know that

01:27:14.457 --> 01:27:18.836
for too long, this country
has treated our lives far too cheaply.

01:27:20.171 --> 01:27:21.923
Tanks with insufficient armor.

01:27:23.049 --> 01:27:24.384
Poor supply chains,

01:27:24.384 --> 01:27:26.511
leading to starvation and disease,

01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:29.264
causing the most casualties
during the war.

01:27:30.598 --> 01:27:34.060
Fighter planes built
without ejection seats,

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:35.853
which should be the bare minimum.

01:27:37.313 --> 01:27:38.273
And finally,

01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:41.192
kamikaze and suicide attacks.

01:27:43.361 --> 01:27:45.321
Those are the reasons why, this time,

01:27:47.073 --> 01:27:49.409
I want this citizen-led effort of ours...

01:27:51.577 --> 01:27:54.455
to be one that aims
to sacrifice no lives at all!

01:27:56.416 --> 01:27:58.167
Because this next battle

01:27:59.252 --> 01:28:01.170
isn't about a fight to the death.

01:28:02.463 --> 01:28:05.008
This battle is a fight
to live for our future.

01:28:08.094 --> 01:28:10.930
All right, yes! Okay! Let's do this!

01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:13.891
[indistinct chatter overlapping]

01:28:16.686 --> 01:28:19.814
- [resolute music playing]
- Finally, tomorrow's the day.

01:28:20.315 --> 01:28:21.649
Look at me. I'm shivering.

01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:23.067
You're not going, Kid.

01:28:25.028 --> 01:28:26.738
[chuckles] What do you mean?

01:28:26.738 --> 01:28:30.074
We're not gonna have any use for you
while your arm is like that.

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.285
Shikishima still gets to go.

01:28:33.161 --> 01:28:35.330
Hold on.
Is this 'cause I wasn't in the war?

01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:37.165
I can help you. I'm not useless!

01:28:37.165 --> 01:28:38.374
Look, Kid.

01:28:38.374 --> 01:28:40.001
Not being part of a war

01:28:41.085 --> 01:28:43.004
is something to be grateful for.

01:28:49.802 --> 01:28:51.971
I still wanna defend my country too.

01:28:55.141 --> 01:28:57.435
I don't understand why I don't get to go!

01:28:59.812 --> 01:29:02.899
I thought we were a team,
that we were in this together!

01:29:04.442 --> 01:29:05.526
Don't do this!

01:29:06.861 --> 01:29:08.529
I wanna be there with you!

01:29:09.238 --> 01:29:11.032
Let me go! Please!

01:29:11.032 --> 01:29:13.659
We're leaving
this country's future with you.

01:29:13.659 --> 01:29:14.952
[Mizushima] Captain!

01:29:15.578 --> 01:29:16.746
Noda-san!

01:29:18.331 --> 01:29:19.749
[man 1] Good. Good.

01:29:19.749 --> 01:29:22.168
- [gentle scraping]
- [man 1] Now bring it up.

01:29:23.044 --> 01:29:24.253
Steady the front end.

01:29:24.253 --> 01:29:25.671
Good. Careful now.

01:29:28.299 --> 01:29:29.300
A little bit lower.

01:29:30.635 --> 01:29:31.469
Easy.

01:29:40.103 --> 01:29:41.270
[music fades]

01:29:46.067 --> 01:29:48.319
Akiko, you ready?

01:29:48.319 --> 01:29:50.363
- Here.
- Okay. Here you go.

01:29:52.615 --> 01:29:53.866
And I'll see you soon.

01:29:59.205 --> 01:30:00.581
- And
- Mm?

01:30:00.581 --> 01:30:01.541
Sumiko?

01:30:02.583 --> 01:30:03.876
Thank you for everything.

01:30:17.306 --> 01:30:18.307
Akiko.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.102
You have fun with Auntie?

01:30:21.102 --> 01:30:22.687
Yeah, I had fun.

01:30:22.687 --> 01:30:24.897
That's good. She's nice, huh?

01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:30.736
Is that for me?

01:30:32.697 --> 01:30:33.698
Thank you.

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.706
- Akiko?
- Hmm?

01:30:41.706 --> 01:30:44.333
There's us, but who's this?

01:30:45.084 --> 01:30:46.043
Is that Mom?

01:30:47.170 --> 01:30:49.338
Uh-huh. Mom's right there.

01:30:50.756 --> 01:30:51.757
Look at that.

01:30:53.384 --> 01:30:54.719
You're so talented.

01:30:58.890 --> 01:30:59.891
[Akiko sniffles]

01:31:01.976 --> 01:31:02.810
[sniffles]

01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:05.188
[solemn music playing]

01:31:05.188 --> 01:31:07.356
What's wrong? Why are you sad?

01:31:07.899 --> 01:31:09.233
[crying]

01:31:12.653 --> 01:31:13.738
What is it?

01:31:14.530 --> 01:31:15.531
Akiko.

01:31:16.324 --> 01:31:18.367
It's okay. Hey.

01:31:20.161 --> 01:31:20.995
It's okay.

01:31:21.913 --> 01:31:23.039
Hey, I'm here.

01:31:24.123 --> 01:31:25.583
I'll always be here for you.

01:31:28.544 --> 01:31:30.087
[solemn music continues]

01:32:07.959 --> 01:32:09.377
[solemn music continues]

01:32:41.867 --> 01:32:43.286
Tachibana-san.

01:32:45.121 --> 01:32:46.330
Is it ready?

01:32:50.126 --> 01:32:51.168
Give me a minute.

01:33:03.347 --> 01:33:04.974
There's the bomb you asked for.

01:33:06.309 --> 01:33:08.603
Two machine guns, 140 kilos.

01:33:08.603 --> 01:33:10.938
120 rounds, 80 kilos.

01:33:10.938 --> 01:33:13.608
And we pulled out the main fuel tank,
dropping 400.

01:33:14.233 --> 01:33:16.652
Instead, you've got
a number 25 bomb in the nose

01:33:16.652 --> 01:33:18.738
and a number 50 in the fuselage.

01:33:19.989 --> 01:33:23.075
Good. Now I have a chance
to finally make things right.

01:33:24.744 --> 01:33:25.703
[rattling]

01:33:26.912 --> 01:33:28.122
[rattling]

01:33:32.543 --> 01:33:33.419
[chuckles softly]

01:33:37.673 --> 01:33:38.841
The funny thing is...

01:33:43.512 --> 01:33:45.890
I guess there's a part of me
that wants to live.

01:33:46.932 --> 01:33:48.184
[chuckling]

01:33:50.311 --> 01:33:52.605
No one on the Odo Island crew
wanted to die.

01:33:54.065 --> 01:33:55.816
But <i>they</i> didn't get to go home.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:58.611
None of them.

01:33:58.611 --> 01:34:00.112
They didn't get the chance

01:34:00.988 --> 01:34:02.865
because that monster killed them.

01:34:04.659 --> 01:34:06.327
I know what I have to do.

01:34:29.308 --> 01:34:31.894
This was drawn by a girl named Akiko.

01:34:33.771 --> 01:34:35.815
I want there to be a future for her.

01:34:40.319 --> 01:34:41.946
Godzilla has to be stopped.

01:34:42.446 --> 01:34:43.906
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:34:44.949 --> 01:34:47.076
Well, then, I guess you're finally ready.

01:34:49.286 --> 01:34:50.329
Now... [sighs]

01:34:51.664 --> 01:34:53.290
...this is important. Listen up.

01:34:53.874 --> 01:34:54.709
Down here.

01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:58.087
This is the safety for the bombs.

01:34:58.879 --> 01:35:01.674
Pull it right before
you fly into its mouth. Got it?

01:35:03.843 --> 01:35:04.844
One more thing.

01:35:14.645 --> 01:35:16.272
Oh. Akiko?

01:35:18.816 --> 01:35:21.193
Why are you out here? Are you alone?

01:35:22.486 --> 01:35:23.320
Look.

01:35:30.619 --> 01:35:32.121
TO SUMIKO

01:35:44.759 --> 01:35:49.221
LOOK AFTER AKIKO
USE THIS MONEY FOR HER

01:35:56.687 --> 01:35:58.481
Is it from Daddy?

01:35:59.899 --> 01:36:01.650
Huh? From Daddy?

01:36:02.318 --> 01:36:03.194
Here.

01:36:04.570 --> 01:36:06.947
It's all right. Don't worry, sweetheart.

01:36:06.947 --> 01:36:08.240
[water lapping gently]

01:36:11.410 --> 01:36:14.163
[water plopping]

01:36:14.872 --> 01:36:16.415
[beacon crackling]

01:36:24.089 --> 01:36:26.967
Kuroshio 12 here.
We see floating deep-sea fish.

01:36:26.967 --> 01:36:30.471
35.03 north. 139.41 east.

01:36:41.190 --> 01:36:44.068
[Godzilla voice recording playing]

01:36:47.863 --> 01:36:49.114
[air-raid siren wailing]

01:36:49.114 --> 01:36:52.201
[man 1 over speaker]
<i>Godzilla has been sighted in Sagami Bay.</i>

01:36:52.201 --> 01:36:55.538
<i>The underwater decoy team
is deploying the audio lure</i>

01:36:55.538 --> 01:36:57.748
<i>to bring it to the target area.</i>

01:36:58.332 --> 01:37:01.001
<i>- All ships expedite schedules.</i>
- [man 2] Take only essentials!

01:37:01.001 --> 01:37:03.379
[man 1] <i>Leave port
as soon as everyone is aboard.</i>

01:37:03.379 --> 01:37:04.880
We'd better go.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.215
[man 3] Move! Move! Move!

01:37:06.799 --> 01:37:10.678
- Looks like Mizushima finally gave up.
- I feel bad, but it's for his own good.

01:37:10.678 --> 01:37:13.556
To be honest,
I didn't want Shikishima flying either.

01:37:13.556 --> 01:37:16.058
I'm worried he could do
something reckless today.

01:37:16.058 --> 01:37:17.059
I don't want that.

01:37:17.059 --> 01:37:19.812
He's got Akiko.
He can't just leave her alone.

01:37:20.396 --> 01:37:21.939
[distant booming]

01:37:21.939 --> 01:37:23.399
[fearful gasping]

01:37:27.444 --> 01:37:28.445
[man 4 screams]

01:37:30.364 --> 01:37:33.158
[man 1] <i>The underwater decoy team
has been destroyed!</i>

01:37:33.158 --> 01:37:38.497
<i>Godzilla has entered Sagami Bay!
Wada Tsumi ships, leave port at once!</i>

01:37:39.164 --> 01:37:40.082
Look.

01:37:41.083 --> 01:37:42.084
There it is.

01:37:42.585 --> 01:37:43.878
[Noda] It's already here.

01:37:44.503 --> 01:37:46.422
[bombs exploding]

01:37:55.431 --> 01:37:57.808
[man 1 on radio] <i>Godzilla's through
the final line of defense!</i>

<i>It's heading for shore!</i>

01:38:00.227 --> 01:38:01.145
That's my signal.

01:38:09.194 --> 01:38:11.113
[resolute music playing]

01:38:25.002 --> 01:38:26.337
[resolute music continues]

01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:58.619
Get out there and put an end to this war,

01:38:59.703 --> 01:39:00.704
Shikishima.

01:39:01.288 --> 01:39:03.624
[man 1 over speaker]
<i>Everyone, leave port now!</i>

01:39:03.624 --> 01:39:06.418
<i>Repeat, all Wada Tsumi ships
are to finish boarding</i>

01:39:06.418 --> 01:39:08.379
<i>and leave port immediately!</i>

01:39:09.254 --> 01:39:10.589
[waves crashing]

01:39:14.051 --> 01:39:15.386
What now, Doc?

01:39:16.136 --> 01:39:17.888
It's too late to do anything.

01:39:17.888 --> 01:39:21.016
No, we just have to keep going.
The Sagami Trench is key.

01:39:21.016 --> 01:39:23.560
There's nowhere else suitable
to execute our plan.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.895
But we need to be there.

01:39:24.895 --> 01:39:28.440
We have to rely on Shiki-san
to lure it out to us!

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.609
- Yes, sir!
- All right, let's go!

01:39:31.318 --> 01:39:33.237
[resolute music continues]

01:39:46.917 --> 01:39:48.877
Noda-san! Shikishima's calling!

01:39:50.796 --> 01:39:53.048
Shikishima here.
I've taken off successfully.

01:39:53.048 --> 01:39:55.509
I'll start to lure Godzilla
to the target area.

01:39:55.509 --> 01:39:57.678
Good. We'll make sure
that we're ready for you.

01:39:57.678 --> 01:40:01.890
- [Shikishima] <i>Get to the target quickly.</i>
- Shikishima! You better not try anything!

01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:04.226
I won't let you abandon Akiko,
you got that?

01:40:07.312 --> 01:40:09.023
Do you hear me, Shikishima?

No! At least not yet.
We need to start while we still can.

Doctor, it'll shoot the heat ray again!

Not for a while.

01:44:39.584 --> 01:44:42.379
Once Godzilla fires its heat ray,
it has to recharge.
