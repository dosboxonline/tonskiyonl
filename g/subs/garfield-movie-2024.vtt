WEBVTT

01:38.056 --> 01:44.813
Okay, time to eat.
Let's see... Open the app.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.483
I'm gonna get
a double pepperoni pizza,

01:48.483 --> 01:51.153
order of breadsticks,

01:51.153 --> 01:54.907
and, well,
lasagna. Yeah.

01:54.907 --> 01:59.244
New item alert?
Jalapeño breadstick quick bites.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.206
It might be nice to have
something in the salad family.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.374
And do I want dessert?

02:05.667 --> 02:09.213
I'm gonna be naughty,
butterscotch budino.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.006
Okay, I'm gonna have five.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.550
Delivery?

02:14.635 --> 02:17.137
Goes without saying.
Now, please.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.141
All right, that ought to hold me
'til breakfast.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.894
Hey! Wait, are you guys early
or am I late?

02:23.894 --> 02:27.731
No matter. I have got
a real treat for you today.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.609
No, not a treat for you.

02:33.737 --> 02:34.738
Okay.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.784
Anyway, about that treat.

02:39.451 --> 02:42.329
Can I just say,
you will not be disappointed?

02:42.329 --> 02:46.667
It's a story about me that
no one's ever heard before,

02:46.667 --> 02:49.378
featuring someone in my life
you've never met.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.507
I don't know about you,
but color me intrigued.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.303
Yeah, drone delivery.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.013
Welcome to the future.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.474
You know, to really
understand everything,

03:02.474 --> 03:05.018
I'm gonna have to take you back
to where it all began.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.730
Don't want anything to take away
from the flavor of the cheese.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.614
And like every great story,
it all started...

03:22.953 --> 03:25.747
on a dark and stormy night.

03:32.171 --> 03:36.216
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

04:53.544 --> 04:57.256
<i>...moon hits your eye
like a big pizza pie</i>

04:57.256 --> 04:59.341
<i>That's amore</i>

04:59.341 --> 05:03.971
<i>- That's amore
- When the world seems to shine</i>

05:03.971 --> 05:08.475
<i>Like you've had too much wine
That's amore</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:10.686
<i>That's amore</i>

05:10.686 --> 05:12.938
<i>- Bells will ring
- Ting-a-ling-a-ling</i>

05:12.938 --> 05:16.483
<i>- Ting-a-ling-a-ling
- And you'll sing "vita bella"</i>

05:16.483 --> 05:19.361
<i>Vita bella, vita bella</i>

05:19.361 --> 05:21.405
- Open wide, Jake.
<i>- Hearts will play</i>

05:21.405 --> 05:26.660
<i>Tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella</i>

05:26.660 --> 05:28.203
<i>Lucky fella</i>

05:29.830 --> 05:34.376
<i>When the stars make you drool</i>

05:34.376 --> 05:38.547
<i>Just like pasta fasul
That's amore</i>

05:38.547 --> 05:41.508
Hi there, little buddy! Hi!

05:41.508 --> 05:45.470
<i>When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet</i>

05:45.470 --> 05:49.391
<i>- You're in love</i>
- I'm so full.

05:50.225 --> 05:54.521
<i>When you walk in a dream</i>

05:55.898 --> 05:57.816
<i>But you know...</i>

05:57.816 --> 06:03.280
- You hungry, little guy?
<i>- ...you're not dreaming, signore</i>

06:04.740 --> 06:08.118
- You want a little more?
<i>- Scusami, but you see</i>

06:08.118 --> 06:10.787
<i>- Back in old Napoli</i>
- You are a hungry little guy.

06:10.787 --> 06:15.250
<i>- That's amore</i>
- That was a quick dinner,

06:15.250 --> 06:16.335
Signore Jon.

06:16.335 --> 06:20.464
You must have been very hungry.
Can I bring you anything else?

06:21.423 --> 06:22.799
Yes.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.510
Thank you very much.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.595
Some... lasagna?

06:26.595 --> 06:29.306
- Si, lasagna for one.
- Yeah.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.225
You know what, no.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.893
- Make it family-style.
- Very good.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.687
- To go, please, Vito.
- Okay, everybody!

06:35.687 --> 06:38.273
- What? Where'd he go?
- You all know this one!

06:38.273 --> 06:39.399
Hey!

06:39.399 --> 06:42.069
Stand up and sing. Join with us!

06:42.069 --> 06:46.448
No! Hey!
Oh, no, I'm dancing.

06:46.448 --> 06:50.661
Excuse me, pardon me.
I hate this. What? Hey! Oh, no.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.581
Hey!

07:03.632 --> 07:08.428
- Hey!
- Jon! Takeout for Jon!

07:10.722 --> 07:12.558
- Hey!
- Your takeout is ready,

07:12.558 --> 07:14.017
- Signore Jon.
- Yes.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.812
One famiglia style lasagna,
to go.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.315
- You eat alone too much, Jon.
- Yeah.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.900
You should get on
the dating apps.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.443
- There's Bumble, Tinder...
- I'm good, thanks.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.653
Gluten-Free Singles...

07:24.653 --> 07:26.572
- Hot Sauce Passions.
- No, I could never...

07:26.572 --> 07:28.907
And you should spend serious
money on premium memberships.

07:28.907 --> 07:29.992
Bye!

07:34.162 --> 07:35.163
Hey!

07:35.747 --> 07:37.749
Well, that was
an interesting dinner...

07:37.749 --> 07:38.834
that you had.

07:40.502 --> 07:44.381
Well, I guess...
this is where we say goodbye.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.510
You're really cute

07:49.011 --> 07:52.055
but I can't have pets
in my apartment.

07:52.723 --> 07:59.146
So, I'll see you around. Okay?
Go on.

08:01.607 --> 08:04.693
No. No, don't cry, don't cry.

08:08.363 --> 08:11.033
No, no, no! No. Oh, no. Oh, no.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.952
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.794
You don't have a home, do you?

08:31.929 --> 08:37.017
<i>Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli</i>

08:37.017 --> 08:41.605
<i>- That's amore
- Amore</i>

08:41.605 --> 08:46.026
<i>That's amore</i>

08:48.320 --> 08:50.656
And that's how I adopted Jon.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.041
<i>So, I moved Jon
out of his apartment...</i>

09:01.041 --> 09:04.211
<i>to this nice little two-bed,
two-bath in the suburbs.</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:07.548
<i>As soon as he understood
the ground rules,</i>

09:07.548 --> 09:10.300
<i>well, let's just say...
we were living the dream.</i>

09:14.388 --> 09:17.140
<i>And once we were settled in,
I even let Jon get a pet.</i>

09:31.864 --> 09:34.032
<i>Odie became
my most trusted ally.</i>

09:34.032 --> 09:35.742
<i>He was kind, gentle...</i>

09:35.742 --> 09:39.246
<i>and most importantly,
my unpaid intern.</i>

10:00.058 --> 10:01.059
<i>Yeah, as you can see,</i>

10:01.059 --> 10:03.645
<i>life here is
pretty near perfect.</i>

10:04.897 --> 10:05.939
Well, yeah, except for...

10:07.816 --> 10:08.984
Time to go to the vet!

10:11.945 --> 10:13.238
We're gonna need the big scale!

10:13.238 --> 10:16.033
Does she need to announce it
to the whole office?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.503
No! Please, no! It's so hot,
it's really hurting!

10:34.885 --> 10:37.221
And that's why we should go from
Sunday to Tuesday.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.015
Okay. Where were we?

10:42.309 --> 10:45.270
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
Good morning!

11:09.169 --> 11:10.796
What?
Where'd you get that chair?

11:20.639 --> 11:22.349
<i>I think I was meant to be
here tonight</i>

11:22.349 --> 11:23.851
<i>because I was meant to meet you.</i>

11:23.851 --> 11:26.228
<i>- I think we were meant to be.
- That's what I meant to say.</i>

11:26.228 --> 11:27.604
<i>You had me at the word, "meant."</i>

11:33.527 --> 11:35.070
<i>We're gonna ride like the wind!</i>

11:35.070 --> 11:37.573
<i>Faster! Harder! More insane!</i>

11:42.661 --> 11:43.662
Odie?

11:43.662 --> 11:45.163
Yeah, can you put this
back to normal?

11:45.163 --> 11:46.582
There you go,
just let the pepperoni's

11:46.582 --> 11:48.041
healing powers work its magic.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.026
You saw nothing.

12:23.827 --> 12:27.164
<i>Up until that moment,
my life was a perfect soufflé.</i>

12:28.832 --> 12:31.793
<i>Little did I know
it was all about to collapse.</i>

12:34.338 --> 12:37.382
<i>Imagine yourself drifting away</i>

12:37.382 --> 12:39.801
<i>on a sea of tranquility.</i>

12:40.511 --> 12:43.055
<i>There are no pets to bother you,</i>

12:43.055 --> 12:46.725
<i>distract you
or max out your credit card</i>

12:46.725 --> 12:50.938
<i>by excessively placing
online food orders.</i>

12:57.819 --> 13:01.949
Yeah... Sorry...
What? Who said that?

13:02.950 --> 13:06.036
Odie, Odie? Odie!

13:06.828 --> 13:08.372
It's time for
our midnight snack.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.922
Thank you, good sir,

13:16.922 --> 13:18.632
your kindness will be rewarded.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.183
What are we feeling
like today? French?

13:28.183 --> 13:34.189
Italian? Chinese? Cupcakes?
Chinese it is.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.859
Odie, shape everything
from the bottom two shelves

13:36.859 --> 13:37.985
into a dumpling.

14:05.679 --> 14:09.391
- Late night snackin'.
- Not good for digestion!

14:10.893 --> 14:13.437
Odie, I'm dreamin' again.
Slap me across the face.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.400
Nope. Still dreamin'.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.943
I must be really deep
in this one.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.621
What do you guys...
You want money?

14:30.621 --> 14:33.749
I don't have any money, okay?
Who carries cash anymore?

14:33.749 --> 14:36.668
I've got Jon's
credit card number memorized...

14:36.668 --> 14:40.631
Five-5-5-2-3-8-5-7-5-5-2-1.
Did you write that down?

14:40.631 --> 14:46.553
- Expiration code is 5-5-5.
- The cat is out of the bag!

14:53.185 --> 14:54.937
I really hope
this kidnapping plan works

14:54.937 --> 14:56.605
or she'll put us down...

14:57.397 --> 14:59.942
with her insults
and cutting observations.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.986
I think this is a case
of mistaken identity.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.446
You must be looking for another

15:04.446 --> 15:06.281
gorgeous, lovable
kitty cat, right?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.493
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, where're you going?

15:09.493 --> 15:10.994
No, no, come back, come back!

15:16.750 --> 15:20.420
Odie? I'll handle this.
All right, you guys.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.840
I'm giving you
to the count of three

15:22.840 --> 15:26.009
to get back here
and let us down.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.887
One, two, three!

15:30.264 --> 15:32.140
Four, five...

15:32.140 --> 15:33.475
I am not kidding here!

15:36.061 --> 15:41.441
Three hundred and eight,
309, 300...

15:42.442 --> 15:46.780
Yeah, they're not comin'.
It's over.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.621
Am I dead?

15:57.082 --> 15:58.709
Are you an angel?

16:05.174 --> 16:07.634
Please, take me.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.220
I am ready to go to that...

16:11.013 --> 16:13.307
to that all-you-can-eat
buffet in the sky.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.353
What? Listen, I'm going to
swing you out,

16:18.353 --> 16:21.148
cut your ropes and drop you
safely to that landing below.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.233
Wait, what?
That seems a tad risky.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.693
Is there another plan
that doesn't involve

16:24.693 --> 16:26.486
cutting a rope
over a 40-foot drop?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.031
No time. We gotta get outta here
before they come back.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.878
We need to go. Come on, Junior!

16:44.046 --> 16:46.673
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.594
<i>I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.</i>

16:55.098 --> 16:59.061
- You!
- Hey! Junior.

17:00.187 --> 17:04.483
"Who is he?"
This is Vic. My "father."

17:04.483 --> 17:06.734
Look, Junior,
I know how you might be upset.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.694
Upset? Why would I be upset?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.365
You only abandoned me
in an alley as a kitten.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.450
I'm probably just overreacting!

17:25.337 --> 17:27.005
Oh, no, not her.

17:27.005 --> 17:30.259
Okay, follow me, Junior.
No, no, no.

17:30.259 --> 17:31.844
You lost the privilege
of telling me

17:31.844 --> 17:33.637
what to do a long time ago.

17:33.637 --> 17:37.140
- Hello, Vic.
- Dang it!

17:37.808 --> 17:42.312
Scare cam!
You should've seen your faces!

17:45.399 --> 17:47.651
Okay, boys, show me!

17:48.235 --> 17:49.695
<i>Hello, Vic.</i>

17:49.695 --> 17:50.946
<i>Dang...</i>

17:54.533 --> 17:56.159
Post that ASAP!

18:01.206 --> 18:05.752
What? Hey, Jinx!
I haven't seen you since...

18:06.837 --> 18:10.215
Well, no hard feelings
though, right?

18:11.842 --> 18:13.677
I don't think so.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.097
I'm a hugger!

18:18.056 --> 18:19.224
Part of me
wants to be mad at her

18:19.224 --> 18:21.351
for kidnapping us,
but you gotta love her energy.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.228
Where are my manners?

18:24.396 --> 18:25.814
Chop-chop, gentlemen!
Look alive!

18:41.079 --> 18:42.164
Perfection.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.333
You know, I was so delighted

18:44.333 --> 18:47.503
that you accepted
my invitation here tonight.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.046
Well, throwing us
in a burlap sack

18:49.046 --> 18:50.214
wasn't exactly an Evite.

18:50.214 --> 18:53.967
Vic, you're so quiet.
Are you feline sad?

18:53.967 --> 18:56.595
Cat got your tongue?
Would you prefer a mew-mosa?

18:57.346 --> 18:59.306
Excuse me,
how do you two know each other?

18:59.306 --> 19:02.392
- Let me handle this, Junior.
- Don't "Junior" me.

19:02.392 --> 19:05.854
You may call me Garfield,
Mr. Garfield, or G-Money.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.189
Okay, whatever, no G-Money.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.108
Anyway, can somebody
please tell me what is going on?

19:10.108 --> 19:12.152
We really
don't need to get into...

19:12.152 --> 19:13.403
I'll take this one.

19:18.867 --> 19:19.868
What?

19:20.452 --> 19:23.372
I'm from a small town
outside London

19:23.372 --> 19:25.040
that you've probably
never heard of.

19:26.124 --> 19:29.711
I scratched and clawed my way
through hard times...

19:29.711 --> 19:32.923
to come here with one dream.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.477
<i>I wanted to be seen.</i>

19:47.062 --> 19:49.314
<i>I wanted to matter.</i>

19:52.234 --> 19:54.903
<i>But I was a failure.</i>

19:54.903 --> 19:56.280
The winner!

20:01.159 --> 20:04.872
<i>And then I met Vic and his crew.</i>

20:05.789 --> 20:09.501
<i>They were outcasts,
losers, thugs.</i>

20:10.419 --> 20:12.963
<i>We didn't have much,
but we had each other.</i>

20:13.714 --> 20:15.924
<i>We became a real family.</i>

20:17.092 --> 20:19.553
Vic and family?
I know where this is goin'.

20:19.553 --> 20:20.637
Excuse me,

20:20.637 --> 20:23.265
<i>garçon,</i>
when might we expect appetizers?

20:23.265 --> 20:26.351
- Perhaps an amuse-bouche?
- And then one night...

20:27.394 --> 20:29.313
<i>We were about to make
our biggest score.</i>

20:29.313 --> 20:32.858
<i>Enough milk
to last us for weeks.</i>

20:37.487 --> 20:38.488
Vic!

20:40.532 --> 20:42.492
Vic!

20:44.620 --> 20:46.955
Jinx, I tried to come back
for you.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.373
You have to know that.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.877
- Yes, you get an "A" for effort.
- So, what happened next?

20:51.877 --> 20:55.380
Imagine Alcatraz...
but smellier.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.634
<i>It was cold. And lonely.</i>

20:58.634 --> 21:02.971
<i>And stinky. So very stinky.
I can't overstate that enough.</i>

21:04.264 --> 21:07.518
<i>But it gave me purpose.
I needed to get out.</i>

21:08.185 --> 21:09.728
<i>I just needed help.</i>

21:24.159 --> 21:26.078
So, your purpose
was to escape jail

21:26.078 --> 21:27.704
and get involved with charities?

21:27.704 --> 21:29.581
No. My purpose was...

21:30.541 --> 21:31.792
revenge.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.711
I see,
I went the other way with it.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.630
I'm kidding.

21:36.630 --> 21:38.841
Another cat
would be bent on revenge,

21:38.841 --> 21:41.510
but I'm...
How would you put it?

21:41.510 --> 21:42.928
Evolved, compassionate,

21:42.928 --> 21:46.265
- and incredibly self-actualized.
- Bingo!

21:47.015 --> 21:48.892
I had such trouble finding him

21:48.892 --> 21:51.103
and when I discovered
you were his son,

21:51.103 --> 21:54.147
I had no choice but to
kidnap you to lure him here.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.149
No, listen, I totally get it.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.735
It's all part of bein'
associated with Vic.

21:59.361 --> 22:02.823
So, what do you need from him
to make this right?

22:02.823 --> 22:04.366
I simply want him to pay back

22:04.366 --> 22:06.076
the quart of milk
I lost that night

22:06.076 --> 22:08.078
- and we'll call it even.
- I can do that.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.288
What he can't do
is raise a child.

22:09.288 --> 22:10.789
- Just one quart.
- Just one quart.

22:10.789 --> 22:11.915
- Done.
- Done.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.417
For every day
I was in the pound.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.669
- What now?
- Nice twist. Well played.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.212
How long were you
in the pound again?

22:17.212 --> 22:19.339
Four years,
seven months and two days.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.424
That long?

22:20.424 --> 22:21.884
All right, I'm gonna do
the math here

22:21.884 --> 22:24.845
in my brain.
The way you do that is...

22:24.845 --> 22:28.307
Odie? 1,675 quarts of milk.

22:28.307 --> 22:30.309
Exactly right, Odie.
We both came up with it

22:30.309 --> 22:31.393
at the exact same time.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.146
Where am I gonna find
that much milk?

22:34.146 --> 22:36.190
Well, I suggest
you go back to the place

22:36.190 --> 22:37.733
you double-crossed me.

22:37.733 --> 22:42.070
- Lactose Farms.
- Wow. Well, good luck, Vic!

22:43.155 --> 22:45.199
I'll leave you two to work out
the fine print.

22:45.199 --> 22:47.284
We'll just see ourselves out.
Odie?

22:48.535 --> 22:50.996
No. You're all going to do this.

22:50.996 --> 22:52.414
What? Wait, why me?

22:52.414 --> 22:54.208
He's the one who abandoned you.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.668
Yes, but this is more
than a one-cat job.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.212
Yeah, but I'm sure
Vic has a whole crew

22:58.212 --> 23:00.214
of low-life cat burglars
he could ask.

23:00.214 --> 23:01.757
I'm sure he does.

23:01.757 --> 23:03.383
But if I'm being
completely honest,

23:03.383 --> 23:05.093
seeing how miserable
you make one another

23:05.093 --> 23:07.262
brings me endless satisfaction.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.389
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.767
And if I don't go?

23:11.767 --> 23:15.020
You can stay and have a playdate
with Roland and Nolan.

23:15.020 --> 23:18.023
Okay, boys...
go play!

23:26.698 --> 23:28.575
Ma'am, I think
this is an opportunity

23:28.575 --> 23:30.536
to take a deep,
cleansing breath...

23:30.536 --> 23:33.705
and repeat your
anger management mantra.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.712
Anyone else have any objections?

23:41.672 --> 23:44.049
Nope, I'm good.
Thanks for the opportunity.

23:44.049 --> 23:48.262
Excellent!
Now, you boys have 72 hours.

23:52.558 --> 23:53.725
Or else...

23:56.103 --> 23:57.187
I can't believe
this is happening!

23:57.187 --> 23:59.147
I don't see you for years
and when I do,

23:59.147 --> 24:00.566
you pull me into
a life of crime!

24:00.566 --> 24:02.568
I had this reunion playing
differently in my head too.

24:02.568 --> 24:03.944
Well, that's the difference
between us,

24:03.944 --> 24:06.154
because I never wanted
to see you again!

24:06.154 --> 24:07.865
Now, I totally
understand your anger.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.825
But if you give me
a chance to explain

24:09.825 --> 24:11.493
you'll see I'm not the bad guy
you think I am.

24:11.493 --> 24:14.454
A good guy doesn't leave
his kid in an alley!

24:14.454 --> 24:16.206
- It wasn't like that.
- It was exactly like that!

24:16.206 --> 24:17.708
No, it wasn't.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.126
- Let me tell you what, Junior...
- No, no!

24:19.126 --> 24:21.503
I don't wanna hear it!
This whole thing with Jinx?

24:21.503 --> 24:24.756
This is your mess, not mine.
Come on, Odie.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.676
Can't let you do that.

24:29.178 --> 24:30.929
We'll be watching you.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.181
Like a hawk.

24:42.566 --> 24:43.609
Is today a Monday?

24:43.609 --> 24:45.235
Because it feels
an awful lot like a Monday.

24:45.235 --> 24:46.320
It's Thursday.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.781
- Not to me, it's not!
- Look, I know this isn't ideal,

24:49.781 --> 24:52.826
but we have to do this.
So, let's just try and make

24:52.826 --> 24:55.746
- the best of our time together.
- Our time together?

24:55.746 --> 24:57.998
What are you talkin' about?
Once we get this milk,

24:57.998 --> 25:00.375
I want you out of my life.
Forever!

25:00.375 --> 25:02.169
All right, just relax.

25:02.169 --> 25:03.712
Lactose Farms ain't nothing

25:03.712 --> 25:05.547
but a sleepy little
mom-and-pop dairy.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.174
This will be a quick
grab and go.

25:07.174 --> 25:08.550
You'll be back home
before you know it.

25:10.385 --> 25:13.347
So, how do we even
get to Lactose Farms?

25:13.347 --> 25:14.765
It's way out in the country.

25:14.765 --> 25:15.974
You ever jumped a train?

25:16.850 --> 25:18.352
I've never jumped.

25:18.352 --> 25:21.522
Look, if jumpin' a train
is too hard, just say it.

25:21.522 --> 25:23.649
- How hard could it be?
- Exactly!

25:24.858 --> 25:27.069
This is gonna be fun.

25:29.655 --> 25:30.906
Garfield?

25:30.906 --> 25:32.991
Odie? Hello?

25:34.826 --> 25:37.120
Garfield, how many times
have I told you

25:37.120 --> 25:39.414
to close the refrigerator door?
Ga...

25:40.874 --> 25:42.501
Wait, there's food on the floor.

25:43.585 --> 25:47.422
He's never left food
on the floor. Garfield?

25:48.799 --> 25:53.136
Garfield?
Garfield? Garfield?

25:53.136 --> 25:56.348
Garfield? Garfield?
Garfield?

26:01.645 --> 26:03.647
Our best shot at jumping
on the train is here.

26:03.647 --> 26:05.440
Hold on a sec. I'm just
taking in the wind speed,

26:05.440 --> 26:08.360
the direction of the sun,
and various angles.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.529
Yes, I say we jump the train
from right here.

26:10.529 --> 26:11.780
Didn't I just say that?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.240
I've seen it on television
a million times.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.659
- We'll need a 100 feet of rope.
- Uh-huh, rope. Yeah, okay.

26:15.659 --> 26:16.785
- Great idea.
- Yep.

26:16.785 --> 26:18.036
We'll throw the rope
over that branch

26:18.036 --> 26:19.496
- right there.
- Over the branch. Got it.

26:19.496 --> 26:23.041
Can you follow me? All right.
And then timing it just right,

26:23.041 --> 26:25.502
we swing over
as the train passes by

26:25.502 --> 26:27.671
and land on top of the car.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.923
- Boom!
- Or, we can do this!

26:32.092 --> 26:33.302
Odie, jump, boy!

26:46.440 --> 26:48.108
Part of me wants to help him.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.444
No. This is how he learns.

26:59.745 --> 27:01.038
I don't know,
it's kind of pricey.

27:01.038 --> 27:02.122
How does it handle?

27:03.874 --> 27:04.875
I'll take it!

27:16.887 --> 27:19.848
See? I told you
this was gonna be fun.

27:20.724 --> 27:23.227
You and I have
different definitions of fun.

27:25.896 --> 27:28.273
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Finally! Hello!

27:28.273 --> 27:30.067
<i>You've reached Find My Pet.</i>

27:30.067 --> 27:31.860
<i>If your pet is lost,
we're here to help.</i>

27:31.860 --> 27:34.821
Hi, yes! Great, okay.
My orange tabby and my dog

27:34.821 --> 27:36.823
are both missing
and I need your help.

27:36.823 --> 27:37.991
<i>Please listen carefully</i>

27:37.991 --> 27:39.243
<i>as our menu options
have changed.</i>

27:39.243 --> 27:40.327
- Okay.
<i>- If you'd like to hear</i>

27:40.327 --> 27:41.411
<i>this call in Spanish...</i>

27:41.411 --> 27:42.496
<i>- ...oprima número dos.</i>
- What?

27:42.496 --> 27:43.789
<i>For Pig Latin,
ess-pray even-say.</i>

27:43.789 --> 27:44.873
<i>For gibberish...</i>

27:44.873 --> 27:47.209
Come on. What do I press
to talk to a real person?

27:47.209 --> 27:49.002
<i>Your call is
very important to us.</i>

27:49.002 --> 27:52.840
<i>There are 1,346 people
ahead of you.</i>

27:52.840 --> 27:55.926
What?
Garfield, where are you?

28:01.431 --> 28:03.684
Okay, Vic,
you gotta figure this out.

28:04.810 --> 28:06.603
Jinx can't be trusted

28:06.603 --> 28:10.941
and you gotta keep Junior safe!
You just gotta figure out a way

28:10.941 --> 28:16.196
- to get him outta this.
- Tell me, is it a bur? It hurts.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.782
You pulled my hair.

28:19.658 --> 28:21.618
Is it a gnat? Is it a bug?
A bug?

28:22.160 --> 28:25.706
Odie, Odie!

28:28.792 --> 28:29.877
Okay.

28:35.549 --> 28:36.550
You know what, Junior?

28:36.550 --> 28:40.137
- This is gonna be good for you.
- What'll be good for me?

28:40.137 --> 28:41.221
What we're doing.

28:41.221 --> 28:42.723
We're about to steal
a truck full of milk

28:42.723 --> 28:45.100
from a dairy to pay back
a deranged cat.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.769
What part of that is going to be
good for me?

28:47.769 --> 28:50.022
All of it!
You can't even imagine

28:50.022 --> 28:51.690
the life lessons
you're gonna learn.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.358
Oh, yeah? Name one.

28:53.358 --> 28:55.569
Well, for starters,
you already know

28:55.569 --> 28:57.362
how to get on a moving train.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.452
I found it funny.

29:03.452 --> 29:06.163
All I'm sayin'
is that to break into a dairy,

29:06.163 --> 29:07.581
it's going to
take a few skills...

29:07.581 --> 29:09.333
I'm guessing a rounded,
mush-filled,

29:09.333 --> 29:11.293
overly pampered indoor cat
like you...

29:11.919 --> 29:15.005
doesn't have.
So, we need to toughen you up.

29:15.005 --> 29:18.383
Toughen me up?
Hey, I know tough, Vic.

29:18.383 --> 29:20.552
You've obviously never been
in an Olive Garden

29:20.552 --> 29:22.387
that's run out of breadsticks.

29:23.597 --> 29:25.641
Anyway, I'm never gonna
need those skills

29:25.641 --> 29:27.559
- you're talking about.
- But you'll have them.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.520
I'm never gonna
break into a dairy

29:29.520 --> 29:31.438
or anything else, ever again.

29:31.438 --> 29:33.440
You are missing the point.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.858
You're going to learn
to improvise,

29:34.858 --> 29:36.443
think on your feet,
develop moves

29:36.443 --> 29:39.154
that'll come in handy
out there in the real world!

29:39.154 --> 29:41.156
I wouldn't be
in the "real world"

29:41.156 --> 29:42.324
if it wasn't for you!

29:42.324 --> 29:45.160
True. You'd still be hanging
upside down in the mall.

29:45.160 --> 29:49.373
- No, I would be asleep at home!
- Missing out on life altogether.

29:50.332 --> 29:53.460
Look, I'm just a dad trying to
teach his son some skills.

29:53.460 --> 29:56.463
No, no, no.
You can't make up for five years

29:56.463 --> 29:58.507
- of not being around.
- Yes, I can.

29:58.507 --> 29:59.925
- No, you can't.
- I think I can.

29:59.925 --> 30:01.385
- In fact, you can't.
- Yes, I can!

30:01.385 --> 30:03.971
- You really can't!
- With your attitude, I can.

30:04.847 --> 30:08.016
Okay, whatever, "Dad."
Wow. Great lesson.

30:08.684 --> 30:10.352
I'm done talking to you.

30:10.352 --> 30:11.812
You do not know me,

30:11.812 --> 30:13.647
you don't know
the first thing about me.

30:13.647 --> 30:17.734
I am not pampered.
I'm not anything you think I am!

30:24.032 --> 30:25.492
Okay. I'm just gonna say

30:25.492 --> 30:28.245
that blanket
is not the best idea.

30:28.245 --> 30:30.539
Fantastic, thank you.
I'll take it from here.

30:33.917 --> 30:35.586
Get them off! Get them off!

30:36.461 --> 30:40.465
Get them off me!
What are you doin'?

30:46.013 --> 30:47.556
- What did you do?
- Cedar chips.

30:47.556 --> 30:51.059
Spiders hate 'em.
See? Another life skill learned.

30:51.059 --> 30:52.227
I...

30:52.227 --> 30:54.438
I think the words
you're looking for are...

30:55.022 --> 30:56.064
"Thank you, Pops."

30:56.064 --> 30:57.941
No, the word
I'm looking for is...

30:57.941 --> 31:00.360
- Here's our stop!
- Really? Where?

31:05.616 --> 31:07.492
Odie, you think
he'd see that coming.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.263
Cheese!

31:29.139 --> 31:30.891
- Take your picture.
- Yeah!

31:32.851 --> 31:34.645
Yeah!

31:34.645 --> 31:36.563
- Here you go!
- Yay!

31:49.117 --> 31:51.411
Quaint. Just a simple little
"grab and go."

31:51.411 --> 31:53.497
Okay. Okay, so they've done
a few upgrades

31:53.497 --> 31:55.791
since I was last here.
Why being so dramatic?

31:55.791 --> 31:57.584
All we have to do
is climb the fence...

32:27.614 --> 32:29.575
Wait. Is that Otto?

32:29.575 --> 32:31.159
- Who?
- Otto!

32:31.159 --> 32:32.494
Of "Otto and Ethel."

32:32.494 --> 32:34.746
No clue
who you're talkin' about.

32:34.746 --> 32:37.082
He's one of the mascots
of Lactose Farms.

32:37.082 --> 32:39.001
See? On the side of the barn?

32:40.502 --> 32:42.129
I'll bet he knows
how to get into that place.

32:42.129 --> 32:43.297
Leave him alone.

32:43.297 --> 32:46.425
Seems to be in a period
of meditation... or depression.

32:46.425 --> 32:47.593
Yes, he does.

32:48.635 --> 32:51.263
This calls for tact,
sensitivity, and diplomacy.

32:51.263 --> 32:53.724
Yeah? And where are we
supposed to get that?

32:53.724 --> 32:55.893
I have it. In spades.

32:55.893 --> 32:57.811
Watch!
Maybe you'll learn somethin'.

33:00.814 --> 33:02.733
Excuse me, you're Otto, right?

33:07.654 --> 33:08.655
I'm Garfield.

33:08.655 --> 33:10.240
- A pleasure.
- Go away.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.117
I just wanted to say
I am a huge fan.

33:12.117 --> 33:13.619
I have eaten everything

33:13.619 --> 33:15.037
that has a picture
of your face on it.

33:15.037 --> 33:16.371
I'm not that guy anymore.

33:16.371 --> 33:18.832
I even loved that recalled
provolone from a few years back.

33:18.832 --> 33:20.000
- Junior, no.
- Yeah.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.628
Anyways, here's the thing.
Me and my crew back there,

33:22.628 --> 33:25.255
we're in a bit of a bind.
Got ourselves in a situation.

33:25.255 --> 33:27.633
Long story short,
we could use your help.

33:29.635 --> 33:30.719
You're a fan, huh?

33:31.678 --> 33:34.515
- Yes! Big time.
- Then sing the jingle.

33:34.515 --> 33:37.392
Well, I don't really
sing on command.

33:37.392 --> 33:38.810
I'm not a circus animal.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.729
- Sing it.
- Really?

33:41.647 --> 33:45.692
- Sing it.
<i>- Lactose Farms, Lactose Farms</i>

33:46.401 --> 33:48.570
<i>We've got milks, butters,
creams and cheeses</i>

33:48.570 --> 33:50.572
- More spirit.
<i>- Much as you want</i>

33:50.572 --> 33:51.949
<i>- As much as it pleases...</i>
- Livelier!

33:51.949 --> 33:54.201
<i>Come and take a look
and see what we got</i>

33:54.201 --> 33:56.245
<i>'Cause what we got
is a whole lotta lot</i>

34:00.749 --> 34:04.086
<i>Tasty goodness is our motto
brought to you</i>

34:04.086 --> 34:07.422
<i>By Ethel and Otto!</i>

34:09.257 --> 34:10.592
What was that for?

34:10.592 --> 34:11.927
I hate that jingle.

34:11.927 --> 34:14.388
You could've just
told me to stop.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.203
Let's go. Kids are waiting.

34:51.925 --> 34:52.926
Odie, come back!

34:52.926 --> 34:54.469
Leave him alone!
He might punch you!

35:07.107 --> 35:09.067
Was that Ethel?

35:15.532 --> 35:17.117
A few years back,

35:17.117 --> 35:19.912
Old Man Lactose
was forced out of business.

35:20.913 --> 35:25.167
The corporation that took over
separated me from my Ethel.

35:26.585 --> 35:29.254
<i>- Ethel!
- You are my day!</i>

35:29.254 --> 35:30.839
<i>You are my night!</i>

35:33.258 --> 35:35.219
<i>I was put out to pasture.</i>

35:37.679 --> 35:40.557
<i>She was put on display
as part of the tour.</i>

35:43.977 --> 35:45.604
I tried to get in there

35:45.604 --> 35:49.650
to break Ethel free...
but they stop me every time.

35:51.109 --> 35:55.948
Now, I only see her six seconds,
twice a day.

35:55.948 --> 35:57.866
We feel you, Otto.

35:57.866 --> 35:59.368
Come on, let's go, Junior.

35:59.368 --> 36:01.119
We'll find another way
to break in there.

36:01.119 --> 36:04.540
What could you possibly
want from that place?

36:04.540 --> 36:06.667
You know,
a couple quarts of milk.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.585
Couple thousand quarts.

36:08.585 --> 36:10.087
Good luck.

36:10.087 --> 36:12.005
We'll take any helpful hints
you have.

36:12.005 --> 36:13.131
Pass.

36:13.131 --> 36:15.384
I'm telling you,
it's a life-or-death situation.

36:15.384 --> 36:18.387
Then I hope you've notified
your next of kin.

36:20.138 --> 36:21.348
What if we can get Ethel out?

36:21.348 --> 36:22.891
Or get you a commemorative pin?

36:27.354 --> 36:29.147
Where are we gonna find
a commemorative pin?

36:31.024 --> 36:32.401
Now, pay attention.

36:32.401 --> 36:34.528
Here's the perimeter
of the plant.

36:34.528 --> 36:36.864
And here are the two places
you need to go.

36:37.406 --> 36:40.659
First, the truck
with your milk is back here.

36:41.577 --> 36:44.371
And this delicate buttercup
is my Ethel.

36:44.371 --> 36:47.165
My North Star,
and reason for living

36:47.165 --> 36:51.962
is being kept by those
barbarians in... a petting zoo.

36:51.962 --> 36:53.338
Located here.

36:54.548 --> 36:57.342
This cricket represents
the electrical room...

36:57.342 --> 36:59.428
this snail,
the refrigeration room...

36:59.428 --> 37:02.014
this toadstool
is the loading dock

37:02.014 --> 37:04.308
where you'll find the keys
to the trucks.

37:04.308 --> 37:05.642
Wait, what's the pinecone?

37:05.642 --> 37:07.895
The pinecone is the cheese
and butter room.

37:07.895 --> 37:11.607
- Cheese is my love language.
- Now, for this briefing,

37:11.607 --> 37:13.734
I've done a quick reading
of your personalities

37:13.734 --> 37:16.570
and have chosen tokens
to represent each of you.

37:16.570 --> 37:18.947
You are the majestic bullfrog.

37:22.326 --> 37:24.244
Yeah, that feels right.

37:24.244 --> 37:27.247
You are the curious
and clever chipmunk.

37:27.247 --> 37:29.124
- And you...
- Wait for it...

37:30.083 --> 37:31.543
...are roadkill.

37:32.503 --> 37:37.591
What? No, I get it.
That's a good one, Otto!

37:37.591 --> 37:39.343
Giving your new
best friend roadkill.

37:39.343 --> 37:42.054
Seriously, though,
what's my real token?

37:42.054 --> 37:43.597
That is your real token.

37:44.139 --> 37:46.141
Now, if you have any chance
of succeeding...

37:46.141 --> 37:48.143
Wait, can I... Excuse me, can I
switch to something living?

37:48.143 --> 37:50.562
- Like the snail or the cricket?
- You should've spoken up sooner.

37:50.562 --> 37:52.814
At this point, it would be
too confusing to switch.

37:52.814 --> 37:55.067
Sooner? But you just told me
this five seconds ago.

37:55.067 --> 37:57.361
- Come on, Roadkill, focus.
- Really?

37:57.361 --> 37:59.571
You give Vic
the majestic bullfrog.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.865
You give Odie the curious
and clever chipmunk...

38:01.865 --> 38:04.660
and then you give me,
your new bff, roadkill?

38:04.660 --> 38:06.745
I mean, it feels disrespectful,
not gonna lie.

38:06.745 --> 38:08.288
What makes you think he's dead?

38:08.288 --> 38:10.249
My eyes.
I have eyes and can see.

38:10.249 --> 38:12.501
It's a possum.
They're masters at playing dead.

38:12.501 --> 38:14.294
Well then,
little Daniel Day-Possum here

38:14.294 --> 38:15.587
should do Shakespeare
in the Park!

38:15.587 --> 38:16.797
Things aren't always
what they seem.

38:16.797 --> 38:18.173
You're right.
But in this case, they are.

38:18.173 --> 38:19.925
What's the big deal?
Possums play dead.

38:19.925 --> 38:21.468
Do they, Otto?
Do they play dead?

38:21.468 --> 38:23.136
Do possums play possum,
is that what they do?

38:23.136 --> 38:25.013
Yes. Possums are very clever.

38:25.013 --> 38:26.181
Yeah, I'm sure he was

38:26.181 --> 38:27.850
until the day
he ate a pick-up truck!

38:27.850 --> 38:30.602
Just ignore him.
Please, continue.

38:30.602 --> 38:32.396
I'll just put this back
where you had it.

38:33.230 --> 38:35.274
The straightest line
to the loading dock

38:35.274 --> 38:38.235
is through the snail here,
then the cricket, there,

38:38.235 --> 38:40.988
cut through the toadstool
and onto the rock.

38:40.988 --> 38:43.031
Each of these rooms
have their own set

38:43.031 --> 38:45.033
- of unique challenges.
- Well, why can't we just go

38:45.033 --> 38:46.159
straight through the pinecone?

38:46.159 --> 38:47.786
You don't want to
go through the pinecone.

38:47.786 --> 38:49.371
Looks like the straightest shot
is through the pinecone.

38:49.371 --> 38:51.206
You like walking
with those feet, do you?

38:51.206 --> 38:54.084
You a fan of unimaginable
pain and misery?

38:54.084 --> 38:56.253
Then go through the pinecone.

38:56.253 --> 38:58.255
Stay away from the pinecone.
Got it.

38:58.255 --> 38:59.965
Once you're inside
the facility...

39:01.133 --> 39:03.093
<i>You will enter
the electrical room.</i>

39:03.760 --> 39:05.470
<i>There you will locate
the air vent.</i>

39:07.598 --> 39:09.641
<i>Pop the grate and climb up.</i>

39:11.977 --> 39:17.399
<i>Then, you'll crawl through
a maze of vents and drop down...</i>

39:18.650 --> 39:19.818
<i>to the refrigeration room.</i>

39:20.777 --> 39:22.613
<i>Next, you will need
to hurl your body</i>

39:22.613 --> 39:25.407
<i>over a 30-foot drop...
to a series of hand rungs.</i>

39:26.783 --> 39:28.827
<i>You'll propel yourselves
hand-over-hand...</i>

39:28.827 --> 39:32.080
<i>and drop down
directly into a loading dock.</i>

39:33.123 --> 39:36.251
<i>From there, you'll locate
the keys to the milk truck.</i>

39:37.252 --> 39:39.546
<i>Drive that truck to the west
pasture of the complex,</i>

39:39.546 --> 39:40.797
<i>cut the lock on the gate.</i>

39:41.381 --> 39:43.509
<i>And find the closest thing
we have</i>

39:43.509 --> 39:46.386
<i>to an angel here on earth.</i>

39:49.932 --> 39:52.643
<i>You'll escort my sweet Ethel
onto the truck</i>

39:52.643 --> 39:54.853
<i>and drive her to freedom.</i>

39:56.480 --> 39:58.398
It's going to take mad skills

39:58.398 --> 40:02.027
to get that milk,
and free my dear, sweet Ethel.

40:02.027 --> 40:04.363
Clearly, this one is qualified
for the mission.

40:04.363 --> 40:08.200
But, I have some serious doubts
here about all of...

40:08.200 --> 40:11.328
- this.
- He's pointing to you, Roadkill.

40:11.328 --> 40:14.164
Let's get to work.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.292
Stupid roadkill.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.670
Hey! I'm workin' here!

40:21.171 --> 40:23.090
Definitely a Monday.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.634
<i>Your call is
fairly important to us.</i>

40:25.634 --> 40:27.594
<i>If you've lost a cat,
please press one.</i>

40:27.594 --> 40:29.096
<i>- If your cat is orange...</i>
- Yeah.

40:29.096 --> 40:30.347
<i>...please press two.</i>

40:30.347 --> 40:32.391
<i>This doesn't really
accomplish anything...</i>

40:32.391 --> 40:33.725
<i>but gives you the false sense</i>

40:33.725 --> 40:35.143
<i>that we're engaged with you.</i>

40:39.439 --> 40:42.067
All right, gentlemen,
I've made a list of skills...

40:43.110 --> 40:44.862
...that you'll need
to master in order

40:44.862 --> 40:47.489
to break into Lactose Farms.
Number one,

40:47.489 --> 40:49.741
develop lightning-fast reflexes.

40:49.741 --> 40:51.451
You tell Garfield
there's a plate of pasta

40:51.451 --> 40:52.578
on the other side of that wall

40:52.578 --> 40:54.830
and you will see
lightning reflexes.

40:54.830 --> 40:56.957
Yeah, no, no, no.
Depends what kind of pasta.

40:56.957 --> 41:00.377
This pebble represents danger
you may encounter.

41:00.377 --> 41:02.963
You need to grab it,
before it grabs you.

41:02.963 --> 41:04.089
It grabs me?

41:04.089 --> 41:05.883
Snatch the pebble from my hand.

41:05.883 --> 41:06.967
Too slow!

41:07.718 --> 41:08.760
What was that for?

41:08.760 --> 41:10.721
Being able to grab
the pebble could be

41:10.721 --> 41:12.723
the difference
between life and death.

41:12.723 --> 41:14.516
All right,
let me try that again.

41:16.143 --> 41:17.144
Got it!

41:18.103 --> 41:19.104
Now what was that for?

41:19.104 --> 41:20.731
It's never
just about the pebble.

41:20.731 --> 41:22.399
Come on, Junior,
everyone knows that.

41:22.399 --> 41:25.194
Your head's got to be
on a swivel at all times.

41:25.194 --> 41:26.320
Gotta be ready for anything.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.155
I was ready.
He changed the game.

41:28.155 --> 41:30.324
Sounds like
someone's making excuses!

41:33.452 --> 41:35.329
And what was that
about being ready for anything?

41:35.329 --> 41:36.914
You were distracting me!

41:36.914 --> 41:38.707
Might I suggest putting
your head on a swivel?

41:38.707 --> 41:39.958
You should have
seen that coming.

41:39.958 --> 41:41.919
Toes on the line!
Guard your grill!

41:41.919 --> 41:43.045
Cover your stomach!

41:43.045 --> 41:45.172
There are surprises
around every corner

41:45.172 --> 41:47.758
at Lactose Farms.
You need to stay alert!

41:47.758 --> 41:50.177
Too slow! A baby could have
seen that coming!

41:50.177 --> 41:53.305
Too slow!
Too slow!

41:55.140 --> 41:56.183
Too slow!

41:57.017 --> 41:59.102
You'll never make it
through Lactose Farms

41:59.102 --> 42:00.646
if you can't survive
this training!

42:00.646 --> 42:01.855
Are you for real?

42:01.855 --> 42:03.565
What kinda dairy is this?

42:03.565 --> 42:06.485
The kind of dairy that requires
teamwork to survive!

42:07.236 --> 42:08.987
Danger could be
anywhere, gentlemen!

42:10.614 --> 42:12.491
You've got to be ready
to outrun it.

42:16.662 --> 42:18.080
Here comes the pain!

42:18.914 --> 42:21.041
- Left, right, left, right.
- You're confusing me!

42:36.557 --> 42:38.267
I think I'm gonna need rehab.

42:43.021 --> 42:44.523
If this is going to work,

42:44.523 --> 42:46.859
these two have to be
on the same page.

42:46.859 --> 42:48.360
I'm out of ideas.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.528
You got any?

42:52.197 --> 42:54.157
Can't believe I'm out
in the middle of nowhere

42:54.157 --> 42:55.993
getting beaten up
against my will

42:55.993 --> 42:58.120
by a former celebrity steer.

42:58.871 --> 43:02.708
Odie? Will you tell my son
to please stop whining?

43:02.708 --> 43:04.209
Odie, can you tell Vic

43:04.209 --> 43:05.752
that I collapsed
on this tree first

43:05.752 --> 43:07.296
and that he needs
to find another one?

43:07.296 --> 43:09.673
Odie, can you tell my son

43:09.673 --> 43:12.092
that I will gladly
find another one

43:12.092 --> 43:14.052
when I get the feeling
back in my legs?

43:14.052 --> 43:15.929
Odie, can you tell my father

43:15.929 --> 43:17.389
that he wouldn't be
lying in pain

43:17.389 --> 43:18.473
if he led a better life

43:18.473 --> 43:20.017
and didn't create
problems for himself?

43:20.017 --> 43:23.604
Could you please
inform my son

43:23.604 --> 43:26.190
that he should focus
on fixing his own issues?

43:26.190 --> 43:27.649
Odie? What?

43:28.692 --> 43:30.319
Odie? What'd you do?

43:31.153 --> 43:33.530
After all
I've let you do for me.

43:34.990 --> 43:36.116
What is this?

43:38.076 --> 43:39.661
Hey, watch it!

43:42.748 --> 43:46.001
What's the problem, Vic?
Is this bothering you?

43:47.836 --> 43:51.965
No.
In fact, I don't mind it at all!

43:53.926 --> 43:55.636
I don't mind it either.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.226
I could watch this all day.

44:02.226 --> 44:04.144
- Stop pulling.
- I'm not, you're pulling!

44:04.144 --> 44:06.688
If I was pulling,
you would know it!

44:06.688 --> 44:08.273
Why does everything you do

44:08.273 --> 44:09.566
always end up hurting me?

44:09.566 --> 44:10.943
Hurt you?

44:10.943 --> 44:13.862
All I ever did
was try to help you.

44:13.862 --> 44:15.656
You sure?
'Cause every time you're around,

44:15.656 --> 44:16.949
it ends up with me in pain.

44:16.949 --> 44:19.660
Odie! These ropes
are not funny anymore!

44:20.827 --> 44:24.373
Maybe, if you were a little more
open to seeing me,

44:24.373 --> 44:26.041
things might be
better between us.

44:26.041 --> 44:29.086
You do remember you were the one
who left me in an alley, right?

44:29.086 --> 44:31.088
You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

44:31.088 --> 44:33.298
Then please, enlighten me.

44:36.134 --> 44:37.803
This is about to get real.

44:37.803 --> 44:39.388
That's right.
You're normally never around

44:39.388 --> 44:40.764
to actually defend yourself.

44:40.764 --> 44:42.975
No back door
to slink out of this time.

44:42.975 --> 44:45.310
First, you abandon me,
then years later,

44:45.310 --> 44:47.396
you pull me
into a life of crime.

44:47.396 --> 44:50.440
Well, classic "Father of
the Year" stuff, "Dad."

44:50.440 --> 44:51.817
You know,
why would I ever think

44:51.817 --> 44:53.443
that seeing you
could be anything

44:53.443 --> 44:54.695
other than a train wreck?

44:54.695 --> 44:57.614
I did not leave you
in that alley!

44:57.614 --> 44:58.740
You did!

44:58.740 --> 45:00.659
You told me you'd come
right back. You never did!

45:00.659 --> 45:04.454
No. That is not what happened.

45:04.454 --> 45:07.457
Please! You were probably
on the run from someone

45:07.457 --> 45:10.085
- like Jinx and I was in the way.
- No.

45:11.545 --> 45:14.464
No, that night...

45:16.425 --> 45:17.759
<i>That night was different.</i>

45:42.993 --> 45:45.037
Hey! Shoo, shoo! Get outta here!

46:20.572 --> 46:22.908
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

46:29.081 --> 46:30.332
Hey, get outta here.

46:30.332 --> 46:33.168
Hey, how you doing? Yeah.
I had to shoo a cat.

46:33.168 --> 46:35.879
Yeah, yeah,
diggin' in the trash. Yeah.

46:35.879 --> 46:37.381
So, what'cha up to now, huh?

46:37.381 --> 46:40.300
Still takin' it easy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:40.300 --> 46:46.306
Oh, no, you're kiddin'. Really?
Yeah, yeah.

46:46.306 --> 46:48.892
It's been raining here
for a while now. Yeah, yeah.

46:49.935 --> 46:52.312
Yeah! I'll see you then.
Okay, bye.

48:37.876 --> 48:39.002
I never knew.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.088
I know, how could you?

48:42.297 --> 48:43.841
Why didn't you ever come
visit me?

48:44.758 --> 48:48.971
I did. Million times I...

48:50.055 --> 48:51.974
came to knock on your door

48:51.974 --> 48:54.726
and I'd see what a great life
you had with Jon.

48:54.726 --> 48:56.019
So, I just...

48:57.187 --> 48:59.231
thought it was better
if I kept my distance.

49:00.148 --> 49:03.026
I sense a positive breakthrough
in your relationship.

49:03.026 --> 49:04.736
Am I wrong?

49:05.779 --> 49:08.866
Good.
After an extensive evaluation,

49:08.866 --> 49:10.659
I have concluded
that you two are,

49:10.659 --> 49:12.619
in fact, ready to move forward

49:12.619 --> 49:14.246
- with this mission.
- We are?

49:14.246 --> 49:17.541
- How is that even possible?
- Mathematically, it isn't.

49:17.541 --> 49:20.043
But given your present levels
of incompetence

49:20.043 --> 49:22.504
and overall lack
of basic skills,

49:22.504 --> 49:25.591
I have determined
it would take roughly...

49:25.591 --> 49:28.844
seventeen years to get you both
properly ready for this job.

49:28.844 --> 49:30.470
And since we have...

49:31.221 --> 49:34.016
less than 48 hours,
you've passed.

49:35.267 --> 49:36.268
Congratulations.

50:21.188 --> 50:22.397
She's really losin' it.

50:25.609 --> 50:27.194
Yes, what is it?

50:27.194 --> 50:29.071
They're ready to rob the dairy.

50:30.239 --> 50:31.657
Perfect.

50:32.366 --> 50:35.911
Everything is going to plan.
Now, it's time to make a call.

50:37.955 --> 50:40.541
Excuse me, you keep that thing
in your folds?

50:40.541 --> 50:43.836
That is so disgusting.
You. You dial the number

50:43.836 --> 50:45.003
and put me on speaker!

50:47.798 --> 50:48.799
<i>Hello?</i>

50:48.799 --> 50:51.218
- Hello? Lactose Farms?
<i>- How may I help you?</i>

50:51.218 --> 50:52.886
It's come to my attention

50:52.886 --> 50:54.429
that there'll be
an attempt to rob

50:54.429 --> 50:56.890
one of your
dairy trucks tomorrow.

50:56.890 --> 50:59.810
It's not important who I am
or how I came to know this.

50:59.810 --> 51:02.688
Just think of me
as a concerned citizen

51:02.688 --> 51:04.106
intent on fulfilling my

51:04.106 --> 51:06.275
civic responsibility
as well as...

51:06.275 --> 51:08.569
<i>Meow, meow, meow.</i>

51:12.072 --> 51:13.073
Chief?

51:16.410 --> 51:20.330
- We may have a situation.
- Well, okay then.

51:21.039 --> 51:22.791
Let's go have a look-see.

51:23.667 --> 51:25.085
<i>Meow, meow, meow.</i>

51:27.337 --> 51:29.173
This is the third time
they've called.

51:29.173 --> 51:31.967
It just sounds like some cat
prank callin' us.

51:31.967 --> 51:34.636
If it were a dog barking,

51:34.636 --> 51:36.513
I'd be on board for a prank.

51:36.513 --> 51:38.891
Them dogs are born for mischief,
they just are.

51:39.641 --> 51:42.561
Not cats. Oh, no.

51:42.561 --> 51:45.314
Cats mean business.

51:52.487 --> 51:54.364
<i>Meow, meow, meow.</i>

51:54.364 --> 51:55.949
<i>"I repeat,
there will be an attempt</i>

51:55.949 --> 51:57.951
<i>"to make off with one of your
milk trucks tomorrow.</i>

51:57.951 --> 52:00.037
<i>"I suggest you take
appropriate measures</i>

52:00.037 --> 52:02.623
<i>"to prevent this brazen thievery
from occurring.</i>

52:02.623 --> 52:04.750
<i>"Okay, I'm done.
Hang up the phone.</i>

52:04.750 --> 52:07.252
<i>"Ha, ha.
What an evil genius I am."</i>

52:08.378 --> 52:10.839
Well, then, still seem
like a prank to ya?

52:10.839 --> 52:14.301
- That last part did a little.
- What's our next move, Chief?

52:14.301 --> 52:17.846
Our next move is for me
to go back to my office

52:17.846 --> 52:20.057
and formulate an ingenious plan.

52:21.850 --> 52:23.519
And you go get my car waxed.

52:25.437 --> 52:26.772
Well, well, well,

52:26.772 --> 52:29.316
would you look at that,
Margie Malone?

52:29.316 --> 52:31.735
We're having company tomorrow.

52:32.694 --> 52:35.447
I guess I better take out
my finest china

52:35.447 --> 52:40.202
to serve a heapin' plate...
of justice.

52:48.168 --> 52:49.419
What are those for?

52:49.419 --> 52:52.506
For us to communicate
once you're inside...

52:52.506 --> 52:54.883
the belly of the beast.

52:56.844 --> 53:00.264
Okay. Don't we need something
more like radio headsets?

53:01.014 --> 53:04.017
Indoor cat. These are better.

53:04.017 --> 53:05.727
It just feels like Bluetooth
would be better.

53:05.727 --> 53:06.979
These are better than Bluetooth.

53:06.979 --> 53:08.981
These are better than Bluetooth?

53:08.981 --> 53:10.399
They're equal.

53:10.399 --> 53:13.151
And I don't have to pay
for the brand.

53:18.657 --> 53:21.034
Gold Eagle to Chipmunk.
Do you copy?

53:22.786 --> 53:24.079
Of course, you can hear him.

53:24.079 --> 53:25.664
He's standing
three feet away from you.

53:27.124 --> 53:29.001
I see you sprung
for the binoculars.

53:29.001 --> 53:31.753
Now, we just need to find...

53:33.922 --> 53:35.299
a way in.

53:35.799 --> 53:37.009
Anyone ever told you
that you take

53:37.009 --> 53:38.677
a lot of dramatic pauses
when you speak?

53:42.097 --> 53:43.098
Yes.

53:47.728 --> 53:48.729
Hey, wait up!

53:49.438 --> 53:52.357
- Look at that!
- Bingo.

53:53.817 --> 53:57.070
Hello, everyone!
And welcome to the one

53:57.070 --> 53:59.740
and only Lactose Farms!

53:59.948 --> 54:01.992
If you will all
gather around me,

54:01.992 --> 54:03.368
we'll begin our tour

54:03.368 --> 54:05.162
and head into the heart
of the farm.

54:05.162 --> 54:07.623
I know you're here.

54:07.623 --> 54:11.710
I can feel it.
Show yourself.

54:12.961 --> 54:15.088
<i>Today you will discover
the answers</i>

54:15.088 --> 54:16.590
<i>to all of your
dairy questions,</i>

54:16.590 --> 54:19.801
<i>including the most asked
dairy question of all time,</i>

54:19.801 --> 54:21.720
<i>are curds the whey?</i>

54:22.638 --> 54:25.432
<i>Bullfrog, Chipmunk,
Roadkill, do you copy?</i>

54:25.432 --> 54:27.726
Are you kidding me?
They actually work?

54:27.726 --> 54:29.102
You should take this to
<i>Shark Tank.</i>

54:29.102 --> 54:31.605
<i>Now, remember,
the only way to get the keys</i>

54:31.605 --> 54:34.316
<i>to the milk truck
and free Ethel undetected</i>

54:34.316 --> 54:36.902
<i>is by sticking to the path
I mapped out for you.</i>

54:36.902 --> 54:41.031
<i>If you deviate from that path,
you will trigger security</i>

54:41.031 --> 54:43.242
<i>and all bets are off.
Understood?</i>

54:43.242 --> 54:45.118
All right, look alive.

54:45.118 --> 54:46.620
The electrical access door

54:46.620 --> 54:48.372
should be coming up
on your left.

54:48.372 --> 54:49.748
Okay, this way!

54:50.958 --> 54:52.709
Hey, hey, look! There it is!

54:57.047 --> 54:58.465
Okay, we're in.

54:58.465 --> 55:00.509
<i>Continue through
and locate the air vent</i>

55:00.509 --> 55:01.802
<i>at the end of the hallway.</i>

55:02.636 --> 55:05.013
<i>That will take you
to the refrigeration room.</i>

55:05.013 --> 55:08.934
<i>Factory workers,
your 15-minute break begins now.</i>

55:21.780 --> 55:23.448
Your feet need a deep rinse.

55:30.080 --> 55:32.624
- What's the hold up, Junior?
- How do you get through this?

55:32.624 --> 55:35.502
- You're bigger than me.
- Am I?

55:35.502 --> 55:38.255
- Yes!
- Well, the vent doesn't agree.

55:38.255 --> 55:40.674
- Try sucking in your gut.
- I am.

55:40.674 --> 55:42.176
Try sucking in your butt
and your gut.

56:08.911 --> 56:11.121
Bullfrog, what's happening now?

56:12.789 --> 56:16.335
We fell out of a vent...
into a room that looks like

56:16.335 --> 56:19.505
- it's full of heavy machinery.
<i>- Son of a cud.</i>

56:21.423 --> 56:22.883
<i>You're in the pinecone.</i>

56:26.386 --> 56:29.765
Jiminy Davis!
The perp is a cat!

56:29.765 --> 56:31.808
And this one looks like it could
eat us out of business.

56:32.643 --> 56:34.937
Vic, Vic!
Look, there's the loading dock.

56:34.937 --> 56:37.648
- No! Junior! Don't move.
- What? Why?

56:37.648 --> 56:40.025
We're in the middle
of the pinecone!

56:40.025 --> 56:42.319
Otto told us
to stay out of the pinecone.

56:42.319 --> 56:45.614
Stop. There's no pinecone.
Otto's a bit of a worrywart.

56:45.614 --> 56:47.366
I can walk to the loading dock
from here.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.201
No...

56:49.868 --> 56:50.953
Junior!

56:57.751 --> 56:58.752
Cheddar.

56:58.752 --> 57:01.004
Probably one of my top 26
favorite cheeses.

57:02.923 --> 57:04.800
What do you think happens
when that gets to zero?

57:08.762 --> 57:10.013
<i>Bullfrog, what's happening now?</i>

57:10.013 --> 57:12.808
Roadkill got carried away
into the pinecone!

57:12.808 --> 57:14.852
Listen to me.
You have to carry on

57:14.852 --> 57:16.436
with the mission.
Get to the loading dock

57:16.436 --> 57:18.272
before the workers
return from their break

57:18.272 --> 57:20.148
or you'll miss your only chance
to get that truck.

57:24.486 --> 57:27.197
No, no, no.
No, no, no!

57:29.199 --> 57:31.201
<i>Shred sequence initiated.</i>

57:39.918 --> 57:41.962
Odie! Thanks, buddy,

57:41.962 --> 57:44.214
but I'm pretty full
from the cheddar.

57:44.214 --> 57:45.674
Jump off.

57:45.674 --> 57:47.134
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

57:56.143 --> 57:57.895
Good. He's safe.

58:01.190 --> 58:03.150
Hang on. Wait. Where am I going?

58:04.234 --> 58:08.030
Fondue. Fondue!

58:48.904 --> 58:49.905
Junior.

58:54.326 --> 58:58.288
Hot, hot, hot! Hot!

59:00.290 --> 59:01.667
Junior!

59:10.050 --> 59:11.760
That was too close even for me.

59:14.721 --> 59:15.931
Thanks.

59:15.931 --> 59:18.225
I couldn't let you
have all the fun.

59:18.225 --> 59:19.393
<i>- Workers...</i>
- What?

59:19.393 --> 59:21.395
<i>...your break ends
in five minutes.</i>

59:23.480 --> 59:25.566
Okay, Otto,
we're in the loading dock.

59:25.566 --> 59:26.900
Where are the keys?

59:26.900 --> 59:29.570
<i>They should be hanging
on a pegboard on the far wall.</i>

59:30.988 --> 59:32.072
What do you mean
we have a problem?

59:33.365 --> 59:35.200
- Pegboard's empty!
<i>- Empty?</i>

59:35.909 --> 59:38.704
Now would you look at this?

59:38.704 --> 59:43.083
Three misguided stray pets
trying to steal a truck o' milk.

59:43.083 --> 59:46.420
Never a dull moment
at this dairy, is there, Margie?

59:47.254 --> 59:49.047
Well, you're looking for these,
aren't ya?

59:49.047 --> 59:50.716
Well, here you go then.

59:55.179 --> 59:57.264
So, how's this
gonna play out, fellas?

59:57.264 --> 59:59.683
The easy way or the hard way?

59:59.683 --> 01:00:02.394
And just so you know,
I'm up for either.

01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:07.024
- Follow my lead.
- What?

01:00:15.574 --> 01:00:16.617
Who's next then?

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:20.120
Otto, a security guard
has the truck keys!

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.456
Crazy eyes?
Tragic sense of fashion?

01:00:22.456 --> 01:00:23.624
Yeah. How did you know?

01:00:23.624 --> 01:00:24.833
Marge Malone.

01:00:25.584 --> 01:00:27.878
<i>- Ethel!
- Otto!</i>

01:00:27.878 --> 01:00:29.838
She's not just my nemesis,

01:00:29.838 --> 01:00:31.965
she's also my enemy.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:33.300
Love to hear about it,
but right now,

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.010
- what do we do?
- Get those keys.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:37.137
I'll create a distraction
so you can get out of there.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.890
Come here, you!

01:00:49.566 --> 01:00:51.527
Did you see that?
That's indoor cat style!

01:01:01.078 --> 01:01:02.120
No, no, no.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.414
You're not getting away.
I've already called the pound.

01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:07.167
Your days of thievery end today.

01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:09.920
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:16.343
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:17.636
Otto.

01:01:17.636 --> 01:01:22.182
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.
Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

01:01:23.141 --> 01:01:26.979
- Junior, sorry about this.
- Sorry? For what?

01:01:31.066 --> 01:01:32.067
Vic?

01:01:39.992 --> 01:01:41.660
What are you doing?

01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:46.790
Vic! Don't you go.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.041
Vic!

01:01:49.543 --> 01:01:50.836
Please!

01:01:56.049 --> 01:01:58.510
Send security
to the loading dock.

01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:09.855
Otto!

01:02:12.608 --> 01:02:15.944
You do not want to try me
today, mister.

01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:29.041
Get him!

01:03:07.955 --> 01:03:12.793
Welcome back... Victor.

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:18.549
Hey, Jinx.

01:03:19.258 --> 01:03:21.802
Why are you here?
I was bringing this to you.

01:03:21.802 --> 01:03:24.930
Were you? Really?

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.891
Yeah, of course I was.
That's what we agreed to, right?

01:03:31.812 --> 01:03:36.733
- So, you and me square now?
- Not quite.

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:39.403
There's still the matter
of those five years

01:03:39.403 --> 01:03:40.779
I lost because of you.

01:03:40.779 --> 01:03:43.574
What?
But I thought this settled that.

01:03:45.993 --> 01:03:49.788
It was never about the milk.
It was about you getting caught

01:03:49.788 --> 01:03:53.041
trying to steal it
and being sent to the pound

01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:54.960
like I was.

01:03:55.752 --> 01:03:59.131
You see, Vic,
I needed you to suffer

01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:02.551
like I did.

01:04:04.428 --> 01:04:05.929
I see.

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:07.556
And I'm guessing
you have an idea

01:04:07.556 --> 01:04:09.516
about how that should happen.

01:04:10.017 --> 01:04:13.395
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:04:20.485 --> 01:04:22.321
I can't believe he did that.

01:04:23.071 --> 01:04:28.243
He ran out, and he left me.
Again.

01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:30.996
I thought he'd changed,
but it was...

01:04:32.122 --> 01:04:33.373
it was a lie.

01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:35.417
All of it.

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:42.424
How could I have been so stupid?

01:04:47.596 --> 01:04:51.225
Come on, kid.
Don't beat yourself up.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.103
Vic, man,
we've all been burned by Vic.

01:04:55.103 --> 01:04:57.564
Yeah, that's right.
Burned every cat I know.

01:04:59.107 --> 01:05:01.860
Yeah, the one thing
about Vic you can count on

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.696
- is that you can't count on him.
- Tell me about it.

01:05:04.696 --> 01:05:06.823
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll tell you about it.

01:05:06.823 --> 01:05:10.327
Long story short, we all used
to run in a pack

01:05:10.327 --> 01:05:12.788
until we had to kick him
out the crew.

01:05:13.872 --> 01:05:16.416
Like I said,
couldn't count on him.

01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:17.751
Sounds about right.

01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:19.586
He'd leave
in the middle of a job

01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:21.129
just to go see his kid.

01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:24.550
Yeah, he said
he wanted to check up on him.

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:26.552
Make sure he was doing okay.

01:05:26.552 --> 01:05:29.346
But get this,
he'd never actually visit.

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:30.889
He'd just sit across the street

01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:33.267
from his kid's house
in a giant oak tree.

01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:35.811
- That never happened.
- He'd watch that kid eat...

01:05:35.811 --> 01:05:37.229
- and eat and eat...
- ...and eat...

01:05:37.229 --> 01:05:40.399
- He put a notch in the bark...
- ...and eat, and eat, and eat.

01:05:40.399 --> 01:05:43.151
- ...every time he was there.
- Yeah. Sure, he did.

01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:46.822
He'd go every Sunday night,
rain or shine.

01:05:46.822 --> 01:05:48.365
Said that it was his kid's...

01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:51.034
...family dinner night.

01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:57.916
Okay, hate to tell you guys...

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:01.920
I guarantee
that never happened. Okay?

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.257
You all fell for another one of
Vic's lies. We all have.

01:06:06.091 --> 01:06:08.051
Because that's
what he does best.

01:06:13.223 --> 01:06:15.184
Odie? Odie!
How did you get out?

01:06:15.184 --> 01:06:18.812
Quick, pick the lock on my cage.
Garfield, there you are!

01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:21.440
Jon! Take me away from all this.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.650
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.652
- You want this one too?
- Yes, I do.

01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:26.945
- I was hung upside down.
- You sure he's yours?

01:06:26.945 --> 01:06:28.405
He didn't have a tag.

01:06:28.405 --> 01:06:30.240
- I jumped a train.
- Yeah. He has a tag.

01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:34.119
I have a collar and a tag?
How long have I had those?

01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:36.079
Okay. I'm just gonna
need you to hold.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.790
I will not hold!
I am done holding!

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:42.586
The Jon who was on hold is dead.
Do you understand?

01:06:44.379 --> 01:06:47.508
That's right. I'm back, baby!

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:52.346
I was just talking about you,
wasn't I?

01:06:55.807 --> 01:06:56.934
I've missed you too.

01:07:05.901 --> 01:07:07.402
Pooky!

01:07:10.155 --> 01:07:12.658
I have a lot to tell you.
You're never gonna believe it.

01:07:13.492 --> 01:07:16.036
Crazy stuff happened.
I slept outside, twice!

01:07:16.036 --> 01:07:17.246
I know. Me.

01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:19.623
And I got you
this commemorative pin.

01:07:20.624 --> 01:07:22.167
Dinner time!

01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:23.252
Talk later.

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.521
Say when.

01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:45.232
Never, Jon.
Bury me in cheese.

01:07:47.943 --> 01:07:51.363
I have two more in the freezer.
Let me know when you want 'em.

01:07:51.363 --> 01:07:52.614
I'm gonna go check on dessert.

01:07:53.699 --> 01:07:55.701
I apologize in advance.

01:07:55.701 --> 01:07:58.287
The eating you're about to see
will not be pretty

01:07:58.287 --> 01:07:59.788
and if you have
young children,

01:07:59.788 --> 01:08:01.832
this would be a good time
for them to leave the room.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:17.598
<i>He'd just sit across the street
from his kid's house</i>

01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:19.140
<i>in a giant oak tree.</i>

01:08:40.662 --> 01:08:43.332
I know, I know.
We're coming back.

01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:46.542
I just need to check
something out first.

01:09:07.898 --> 01:09:09.483
<i>He put a notch in the bark...</i>

01:09:11.318 --> 01:09:12.944
<i>every time he was there.</i>

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:31.921
"He left a notch."

01:09:34.508 --> 01:09:35.676
Yeah, right.

01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:19.094
He was here.

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.346
He saw me grow up.

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:27.144
Wow, that really stings.

01:10:27.144 --> 01:10:29.271
I don't know
why I didn't think it would.

01:10:29.271 --> 01:10:30.606
Give me a second.

01:10:32.566 --> 01:10:33.650
Vic loves us!

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.069
Me first, of course,
but then you too!

01:10:36.069 --> 01:10:42.075
But me, a lot, and first!
Wait, but if he loves me, us,

01:10:42.075 --> 01:10:45.245
why would he let me, us,
get captured at the dairy?

01:10:45.245 --> 01:10:47.623
Unless, he wanted

01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:49.082
- us to get captured!
- Hey!

01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:50.167
- Yes!
- Hey, watch it!

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:52.669
He knew that Jinx wasn't gonna
let him off the hook.

01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:55.422
But if we got caught,
we'd get sent to the pound

01:10:55.422 --> 01:10:58.425
and Jon would come to get us!
Don't you see, Odie?

01:10:58.425 --> 01:11:01.053
- He was trying to save us!
- Losers!

01:11:02.721 --> 01:11:04.389
We have to go save my dad.

01:11:05.098 --> 01:11:08.143
And here's
your favorite dessert,

01:11:08.143 --> 01:11:10.812
Mount Candy-toa!

01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.106
Guys?

01:11:18.195 --> 01:11:19.530
Come on!

01:11:28.038 --> 01:11:30.332
What is this?

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:46.932
Half a star for Mamma Leoni's?

01:11:48.225 --> 01:11:49.434
She's a monster.

01:11:51.979 --> 01:11:53.272
She's gonna tie him up...

01:11:53.772 --> 01:11:55.232
take him on a train...

01:11:56.066 --> 01:11:58.652
She's going to throw him off
the Mile High Bridge!

01:11:58.652 --> 01:12:00.988
We're gonna need help.
Who can we call?

01:12:05.284 --> 01:12:06.451
You've got
a lot of waxy buildup.

01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:07.744
What's your Q-tip routine?

01:12:08.704 --> 01:12:09.705
You're right, you're right.

01:12:09.705 --> 01:12:11.790
We can deal
with that situation later.

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:14.668
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there? Hello?

01:12:18.463 --> 01:12:19.590
<i>Get off the line.</i>

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.550
<i>This acorn
is for emergency use only.</i>

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:24.469
Otto! Otto, please, listen.

01:12:24.595 --> 01:12:26.680
I wanna make good
on our original deal,

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.683
but I need a favor first.

01:12:33.812 --> 01:12:36.815
Otto, are you still there or
are you taking a dramatic pause?

01:12:39.902 --> 01:12:40.903
<i>I'm listening.</i>

01:12:46.533 --> 01:12:47.951
You know, Vic,

01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:51.622
you only have yourself to blame
for this.

01:12:53.332 --> 01:12:55.459
Right. Look,

01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:58.128
there's got to be some way
for me to make this right.

01:12:58.128 --> 01:13:00.255
I mean, I know
we can think of somethin'.

01:13:00.255 --> 01:13:04.009
There is, and you will.

01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:18.398
So, once I get on the train...

01:13:18.398 --> 01:13:19.983
I untie Vic and we jump off

01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:21.527
right as
the train gets to the bridge.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:23.654
Correct. Chipmunk
will be waiting for you.

01:13:25.656 --> 01:13:27.032
<i>Confirm your status, Chipmunk.</i>

01:13:29.034 --> 01:13:31.245
If you don't jump right as
the train gets to the bridge,

01:13:31.245 --> 01:13:32.412
you'll miss the net.

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.582
Got it. It's getting close.

01:13:35.582 --> 01:13:37.751
Have you considered
throwing a rope over a branch

01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:39.795
and just swinging
onto the passing train instead?

01:13:39.795 --> 01:13:40.879
You watch too much TV.

01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:42.005
I've never watched TV.

01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:44.383
Well, this way is much better
than your rope idea.

01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:45.968
Better than the versatile,
reliable rope?

01:13:45.968 --> 01:13:48.262
Look, I've studied the science.
I know what I'm doing.

01:13:48.262 --> 01:13:50.681
And you think you can battle
these villains on your own?

01:13:50.681 --> 01:13:53.559
Oh yeah. I have a plan. Odie?

01:13:54.101 --> 01:13:55.102
<i>Make the order.</i>

01:13:58.105 --> 01:13:59.731
Now get ready to fling me

01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:01.859
in the direction
of that moving train.

01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:08.782
Get ready.

01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:12.578
If I don't make it back...

01:14:13.203 --> 01:14:15.289
tell my story. Now!

01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:19.042
Roadkill! You're too high!
You're gonna miss it!

01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:20.836
No, no, this is how you do it!

01:14:20.836 --> 01:14:22.379
It's called
the ricochet approach!

01:14:27.509 --> 01:14:28.802
It won't be long now.

01:14:28.927 --> 01:14:31.096
I can't tell you
how excited I am

01:14:31.096 --> 01:14:32.723
for what's about to happen next.

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:37.561
Dad! I'm here to rescue you!

01:14:37.561 --> 01:14:38.645
No, no, no, Junior!

01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:40.063
- Get outta here!
- I'm gonna untie you,

01:14:40.063 --> 01:14:41.231
and we're gonna
jump off the train!

01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:43.025
- No! Just leave me and go!
- I didn't come this far...

01:14:43.025 --> 01:14:44.818
just to turn around,
let me untie you!

01:14:44.818 --> 01:14:46.945
You're ruining everything!

01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:49.114
Quick, this way!

01:14:58.832 --> 01:15:00.959
You half-wit! Get them!

01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:32.491
The bridge is comin' up!

01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:33.992
We gotta get to the caboose now!

01:15:33.992 --> 01:15:35.994
- What? Why?
- Just follow my lead!

01:15:37.496 --> 01:15:38.497
Wow!

01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:47.422
Oi, kitty cat!

01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:50.509
Did you expect
to take us on all by yourself?

01:15:50.509 --> 01:15:53.887
No. I brought... takeout.

01:16:42.019 --> 01:16:44.146
I never understood
the purpose of salad

01:16:44.146 --> 01:16:46.064
until this exact moment!

01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:55.657
Go, go! Now!

01:16:55.657 --> 01:16:56.867
Get after him!

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:20.057
Yeah, in case
you were wonderin',

01:17:20.057 --> 01:17:21.683
I do my own stunts.

01:17:21.683 --> 01:17:22.768
Me...

01:17:23.894 --> 01:17:25.103
and Tom Cruise.

01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:30.484
Junior!

01:17:36.907 --> 01:17:37.908
Stop him!

01:17:58.428 --> 01:17:59.763
Now <i>that's</i> amazing!

01:17:59.763 --> 01:18:01.139
I can't feel my tongue.

01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:02.224
<i>Roadkill!</i>

01:18:02.224 --> 01:18:04.142
<i>Are you at the caboose,
ready to jump?</i>

01:18:26.874 --> 01:18:28.250
Dad! Dad!

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.252
Jump, Junior! I'll catch you!

01:18:55.986 --> 01:18:57.404
What do we do now?

01:18:57.404 --> 01:18:58.655
We do this!

01:19:02.701 --> 01:19:03.702
See ya, everyone.

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:11.293
The net's too tight!

01:19:11.293 --> 01:19:12.794
Roadkill, the net is too tight!

01:19:12.794 --> 01:19:13.879
I heard!

01:19:20.802 --> 01:19:22.888
Hello again, welcome back!

01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:24.806
Now, where were we?

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:35.651
No, no!
Don't throw them over just yet.

01:19:35.651 --> 01:19:36.777
No!

01:19:37.194 --> 01:19:39.154
I want to find the perfect place

01:19:39.154 --> 01:19:41.657
for them
to make the biggest splat.

01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:44.618
Hey, hey! Junior!
Junior, Junior.

01:19:44.618 --> 01:19:46.870
Get ready! Almost there!

01:19:48.038 --> 01:19:50.123
I'm sorry
my rescue didn't work out.

01:19:50.249 --> 01:19:53.252
No, you gave me another chance.

01:19:53.836 --> 01:19:55.420
That's all that matters.

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:02.219
Now, now! Drop them now!

01:20:03.929 --> 01:20:05.472
What are you waiting for?

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:10.435
Their love for one another
indicates that

01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:12.563
despite their
current circumstance,

01:20:12.563 --> 01:20:14.356
they are at peace.

01:20:14.356 --> 01:20:17.568
- Because they are together.
- So?

01:20:17.568 --> 01:20:20.153
If the point of your revenge
was to hurt them,

01:20:20.153 --> 01:20:22.447
it has done the opposite.

01:20:22.573 --> 01:20:24.283
It's actually textbook irony!

01:20:24.283 --> 01:20:27.953
And we're no longer
comfortable with your plan.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.956
You two
are still as weak as you were

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:33.458
when I found you
sniveling in the pound.

01:20:34.168 --> 01:20:35.711
"No one will adopt us.

01:20:35.711 --> 01:20:37.796
"I never grew into my folds.

01:20:37.796 --> 01:20:40.215
"I hide behind them
because I'm socially awkward.

01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:41.675
"Please, somebody love me

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.677
"even though I can't sit still
for more than ten seconds

01:20:43.677 --> 01:20:45.971
and have the attention span
of a bloody goldfish!"

01:20:46.513 --> 01:20:49.433
We did everything
you ever asked of us.

01:20:49.433 --> 01:20:51.602
I even spoke
with this ridiculous accent

01:20:51.602 --> 01:20:53.437
to make you feel more at home.

01:20:53.437 --> 01:20:54.730
But no more!

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:57.024
I'm New York, loud and proud!

01:20:57.024 --> 01:20:59.318
I love myself the way I am

01:20:59.318 --> 01:21:02.196
and I'm a big, brave, boy, baby!

01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:05.490
And I've been
working on my attention span.

01:21:05.616 --> 01:21:06.700
Is that a hot air balloon?

01:21:07.826 --> 01:21:08.994
You two...

01:21:09.411 --> 01:21:10.704
are...

01:21:10.704 --> 01:21:12.039
Worthless!

01:21:51.662 --> 01:21:55.374
Might I just say as someone else
with a zaftig figure,

01:21:55.374 --> 01:21:57.042
you have a beautiful body, sir.

01:21:58.752 --> 01:21:59.795
Oh, dear!

01:22:03.757 --> 01:22:06.760
Rope. Versatile. Reliable.

01:22:06.885 --> 01:22:08.345
There's something
about your cadence

01:22:08.345 --> 01:22:09.847
that really throws me,
but thank you.

01:22:22.109 --> 01:22:23.110
Tee-hee!

01:22:25.195 --> 01:22:28.198
Tossing me off the train?
Did not see that coming.

01:22:28.198 --> 01:22:29.783
Well, when you live in the wild,

01:22:29.783 --> 01:22:31.910
you gotta keep your head
on a swivel.

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.495
Right.

01:22:34.204 --> 01:22:37.416
It's basic Outdoor Cat 101.

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:39.501
And that had bird poop on it.

01:22:40.002 --> 01:22:42.004
Hey. You good, Roadkill?

01:22:43.714 --> 01:22:44.798
Not quite.

01:22:44.798 --> 01:22:47.634
There's one last thing
to take care of.

01:22:47.885 --> 01:22:48.886
Cut to...

01:22:56.602 --> 01:22:59.354
<i>It was a dark and foggy night.</i>

01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:04.067
<i>The air was damp and
heavier than a broken heart.</i>

01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:06.153
<i>On nights like this,
you can't swing a cat</i>

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:08.530
<i>without hittin' shady characters</i>

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:11.658
<i>makin' shady deals
all over town.</i>

01:23:15.037 --> 01:23:17.831
<i>But this night
was going to be... different.</i>

01:23:17.956 --> 01:23:20.459
<i>Justice was about to be served.</i>

01:23:20.459 --> 01:23:25.047
<i>With a helping
of retribution on the side.</i>

01:23:25.047 --> 01:23:27.716
Is that... the package?

01:23:27.716 --> 01:23:29.718
<i>It is.</i>

01:23:29.718 --> 01:23:31.136
Then we have a deal.

01:23:36.266 --> 01:23:38.185
<i>No one will come
looking for her?</i>

01:23:38.185 --> 01:23:40.479
Nope. I did what you said.

01:23:40.479 --> 01:23:42.189
I burned her paperwork.

01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:44.608
And then shredded it
and burned it some more.

01:23:44.608 --> 01:23:47.361
It's like she never existed.

01:23:47.778 --> 01:23:50.739
Except for the image of her face
on millions of dairy products.

01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:11.468
This...

01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:12.803
<i>never happened.</i>

01:24:13.303 --> 01:24:14.304
Agreed.

01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:19.393
Save it, Cat Fancy.

01:24:19.393 --> 01:24:21.019
I know you planned
the milk truck heist...

01:24:21.019 --> 01:24:23.063
and then tried to throw those
innocent cats off a train

01:24:23.063 --> 01:24:24.147
to cover it up.

01:24:24.147 --> 01:24:26.149
The boys told me everything.

01:24:42.624 --> 01:24:43.709
Otto!

01:24:50.048 --> 01:24:51.758
You are my day.

01:24:52.342 --> 01:24:54.553
You are my night.

01:25:33.467 --> 01:25:35.385
Well, this is us.

01:25:36.053 --> 01:25:38.096
Right. You're home.

01:25:41.099 --> 01:25:43.268
- Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
- I just want to say I'm sorry.

01:25:44.186 --> 01:25:45.771
What are you sorry for?

01:25:49.191 --> 01:25:50.567
For misjudging you.

01:25:52.611 --> 01:25:54.988
Well. Thanks.

01:25:55.697 --> 01:25:57.658
Well, I just wanted to
apologize to you for...

01:25:57.658 --> 01:26:00.994
Everything bad that happened
to us the last three days?

01:26:00.994 --> 01:26:03.163
You know, you had your hand in

01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:05.332
a few bad decisions
back there too, but...

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:09.795
yeah, I'm sorry for
dragging you into my world.

01:26:10.337 --> 01:26:12.381
This is where you belong,

01:26:12.381 --> 01:26:14.508
here with Jon and...

01:26:14.508 --> 01:26:16.468
What's your name again? Odor?

01:26:21.348 --> 01:26:24.518
- So... yeah, I should go.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:26:24.643 --> 01:26:26.270
I mean, unless...
you'd want to come in?

01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:27.938
Nah. No, no.
I don't think that would work.

01:26:27.938 --> 01:26:30.816
- You know, I'm an outdoor cat.
- Right. Sure. Sure.

01:26:30.941 --> 01:26:33.443
- No, I just... I figured that...
- No, no, no, I get it.

01:26:33.443 --> 01:26:34.653
But, you know what?

01:26:34.653 --> 01:26:38.031
I got this thing on the other
side of town I gotta go do so...

01:26:38.031 --> 01:26:39.867
No. I'm very busy too. Yeah.

01:26:41.618 --> 01:26:42.661
See you around then?

01:26:43.328 --> 01:26:44.371
You know where to find me.

01:26:44.371 --> 01:26:45.622
In the kitchen.

01:26:50.252 --> 01:26:51.545
Well, take care.

01:26:53.172 --> 01:26:56.175
And remember,
"stay out of the pinecone."

01:27:00.637 --> 01:27:03.390
What? You heard him.
It's for the best.

01:27:10.022 --> 01:27:12.441
You're back?
What is going on? Are you okay?

01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:13.775
I was so worried!

01:27:13.775 --> 01:27:15.402
You know, I was gonna
add more locks to the door,

01:27:15.402 --> 01:27:17.487
you know, try to keep you in,
but then I thought, "Well,

01:27:17.487 --> 01:27:19.281
"what if they wanted
to be outdoor pets?"

01:27:19.281 --> 01:27:21.074
Do you wanna be free-range?

01:27:22.367 --> 01:27:24.077
I really missed you guys.
And I gotta say...

01:27:24.077 --> 01:27:26.997
it's great to be together again,
the whole entire family.

01:27:26.997 --> 01:27:29.499
You have no idea what the
last few days have been like.

01:27:29.499 --> 01:27:31.752
Phone calls, and hold times
and tears. And more tears.

01:27:31.752 --> 01:27:33.670
Don't give me that,
I asked him to stay.

01:27:34.588 --> 01:27:35.797
He wanted to leave!

01:27:35.797 --> 01:27:37.591
You heard him,
he said he had to...

01:27:37.591 --> 01:27:38.675
Well, I...

01:27:39.843 --> 01:27:41.386
- A family should consist...
- Fine. I'll be right back!

01:27:41.512 --> 01:27:43.472
Wait, wait, what?

01:27:44.431 --> 01:27:46.475
Am I using trigger words
that I'm not aware of?

01:28:19.132 --> 01:28:22.970
So, you coming in or do we have
to bring food up there to you?

01:28:27.975 --> 01:28:29.434
I'll come to you.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.895
I just need to
finish something up here.

01:28:46.994 --> 01:28:50.873
You know, those notches
show how much you love me.

01:28:51.248 --> 01:28:53.208
Is that
what you think they mean?

01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:54.376
Yeah.

01:28:54.376 --> 01:28:58.088
Nah, I was just counting how
many slices of lasagna you ate.

01:29:03.385 --> 01:29:05.095
<i>My medium is cuisine...</i>

01:29:05.095 --> 01:29:08.473
<i>my colors are flavors...</i>

01:29:09.433 --> 01:29:12.477
<i>...my palette is my palate...
if you will.</i>

01:29:20.527 --> 01:29:22.112
Dinner is served!

01:29:27.284 --> 01:29:29.912
Wow, son,
I didn't know you could cook.

01:29:29.912 --> 01:29:32.414
Yes, pasta is my paint, and...

01:29:32.414 --> 01:29:35.375
the dinner plate my... canvas.

01:29:36.627 --> 01:29:37.836
That's where that went.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.804
I've had worse.

01:29:54.311 --> 01:29:55.812
Thank you, Garfield.

01:29:59.942 --> 01:30:02.236
Is he gonna be coming around
for dinner often?

01:30:02.236 --> 01:30:04.821
Yeah, he's family.

01:30:09.952 --> 01:30:11.870
What?
Why do I have a takeout bill

01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:13.830
for 6,000 drone deliveries?

01:37:22.384 --> 01:37:26.805
<i>This is just what I had planned</i>

01:37:26.805 --> 01:37:29.474
<i>Though I'm thrilled to meet you</i>

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.812
<i>I'm just a minx of English brand</i>

01:37:33.812 --> 01:37:36.398
<i>Dreamed of the cat show</i>

01:37:36.398 --> 01:37:38.108
<i>'Til one night in the street</i>

01:37:38.108 --> 01:37:39.902
<i>'Twas my chance I would meet</i>

01:37:39.902 --> 01:37:41.445
<i>A meow so discreet</i>

01:37:41.445 --> 01:37:44.489
<i>We had the world on a string</i>

01:37:45.032 --> 01:37:49.620
<i>'Til he cut town
and left me empty-handed</i>

01:37:52.706 --> 01:37:54.249
<i>I'm back</i>

01:37:54.249 --> 01:37:56.418
<i>And I'm on the prowl</i>

01:37:56.418 --> 01:37:59.546
<i>Revenge would taste
so sweet right now</i>

01:37:59.546 --> 01:38:01.715
<i>- I'm back
- She's back</i>

01:38:01.715 --> 01:38:03.425
<i>It's time for war</i>

01:38:03.425 --> 01:38:07.262
<i>Watch me scratch, hear me roar</i>

01:38:07.262 --> 01:38:08.972
<i>She's a cat on the prowl</i>

01:38:08.972 --> 01:38:10.724
<i>Got a mighty meow</i>

01:38:10.724 --> 01:38:12.351
<i>She's the queen of the streets</i>

01:38:12.351 --> 01:38:15.020
<i>Her name is Jinx</i>

01:38:15.145 --> 01:38:16.438
<i>That's me</i>

01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:19.358
<i>I'm back</i>

01:38:20.234 --> 01:38:23.529
<i>I can't believe
he double-crossed me</i>

01:38:24.071 --> 01:38:26.949
<i>That really was so mean</i>

01:38:27.533 --> 01:38:29.493
<i>We were friends from the start</i>

01:38:29.493 --> 01:38:31.745
<i>A real work of art</i>

01:38:31.745 --> 01:38:35.999
<i>The thickest of feline thieves</i>

01:38:35.999 --> 01:38:37.668
<i>He came up with a scheme</i>

01:38:37.668 --> 01:38:39.878
<i>To steal all the cream</i>

01:38:39.878 --> 01:38:43.590
<i>But I was the only one caught</i>

01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:45.467
<i>I was locked in a cage</i>

01:38:45.467 --> 01:38:47.761
<i>Where my heart filled with rage</i>

01:38:47.886 --> 01:38:50.764
<i>And I developed
this maniacal scream</i>

01:38:54.059 --> 01:38:55.060
Ay, yo.

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.603
<i>It's doggy-diggity-
diggity-diggity-D</i>

01:38:56.603 --> 01:38:58.480
<i>I'm bringing the
biggity-biggity-biggity-beats</i>

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.816
<i>- Don't you...</i>
- No, no, no. Shush.

01:39:00.816 --> 01:39:02.317
In case you hadn't noticed...

01:39:02.317 --> 01:39:05.988
<i>I'm back and I'm on the prowl</i>

01:39:05.988 --> 01:39:09.074
<i>Revenge would taste
so sweet right now</i>

01:39:09.199 --> 01:39:10.784
<i>- Well, I'm back
- She's back</i>

01:39:10.909 --> 01:39:13.036
<i>And it's time for war</i>

01:39:13.036 --> 01:39:16.915
<i>Watch me scratch, hear me roar</i>

01:39:16.915 --> 01:39:18.625
<i>She's a cat on the prowl</i>

01:39:18.625 --> 01:39:20.419
<i>Got a mighty meow</i>

01:39:20.419 --> 01:39:21.920
<i>She's the queen of the streets</i>

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.631
<i>- My name is Jinx
- Her name is Jinx</i>

01:39:24.631 --> 01:39:26.091
<i>That's me</i>

01:39:26.508 --> 01:39:28.927
<i>- I'm back
- She's back, she's back</i>

01:39:28.927 --> 01:39:30.596
<i>I'm a cat on the prowl</i>

01:39:30.721 --> 01:39:32.222
<i>She's back, she's back</i>

01:39:32.222 --> 01:39:34.057
<i>A mighty meow</i>

01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:35.142
<i>She's back</i>

01:39:35.809 --> 01:39:38.353
<i>Her name is Jinx</i>

01:39:38.353 --> 01:39:39.646
<i>That's me</i>

01:39:40.022 --> 01:39:43.859
<i>I'm back</i>

01:39:43.859 --> 01:39:46.069
<i>She's biggity, biggity,
biggity, bigitty back</i>

01:39:46.069 --> 01:39:47.613
<i>I'm back</i>
