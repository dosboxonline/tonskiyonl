WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:04.493
In the not so distant future,
when the corporate networks

00:04.588 --> 00:07.751
fill the earth with electronic
and optical communication lines

00:07.841 --> 00:11.004
but society has not yet been
too computerized

00:11.094 --> 00:15.838
to erase nations and races...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.383
All patrolling air units,

00:19.478 --> 00:23.187
a 208 is in progress
in the c-13 district of Newport city.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.310
Air space over this area
will be closed. Repeat.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.141
All patrolling air units,

00:28.237 --> 00:31.946
a 208 is in progress
in the c-13 district of Newport city.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.318
Air space over this area
will be closed.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.060
There's no need for concern.

01:04.147 --> 01:07.184
Our country is quite capable
of covering its tracks.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.857
That's why you need me, right?

01:08.944 --> 01:12.607
Depends on how you look at it.
At any rate, any program has its bugs,

01:12.698 --> 01:16.282
and I would think that a man
of your capability could cure our problem.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.653
You don't understand.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.861
We aren't even sure that project 2501
really is a bug.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.368
Originally, the purpose of this project...

01:23.458 --> 01:27.326
Major kusanagi, section 6
is in position and ready to move in.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.288
- Major, are you there?
- Yeah, I heard you.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.872
I'm surprised you can hear anything.

01:31.967 --> 01:35.209
What's with all the noise
in your brain today?

01:35.304 --> 01:37.090
Must be a loose wire.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.916
Don't you think
there's gonna be trouble later

01:46.940 --> 01:50.478
if section 9 interferes with section 67

01:50.569 --> 01:52.901
if section 6 manages to catch the bastard,

01:52.988 --> 01:54.988
then all they can really do about it
is deport him.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.023
Don't forget, we're section 9.
We'll clean it up.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.824
We're the ones who get our hands dirty.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.947
It's time now.
Let's move to the rendezvous point.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.526
- What? The police here?
- Huh?

02:50.170 --> 02:53.003
Stop it! Who told you to fire?
Put your guns down now!

02:54.007 --> 02:55.007
Freezel

02:56.009 --> 02:57.340
get your hands up!

02:57.427 --> 02:59.634
I'm entitled to diplomatic immunity.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.882
I want to talk to the person
in charge here.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.555
Taking classified programmers
out of the country

03:04.643 --> 03:06.349
compromises national security.

03:06.436 --> 03:10.805
We can also have you brought up
on kidnapping charges.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.355
You have no choice. Let him go.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.898
Not possible.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.898
Mr. daita wants political asylum from us
and we have his signed affidavit.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.605
- What?
- I don't have to explain.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.613
My country has the right, in accordance
with international law,

03:23.704 --> 03:26.662
to offer anyone protection
and safe passage.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.739
The affidavit is at the embassy.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.995
I'll send you a copy in a couple of days.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.293
Daita, you'll be killed if you return.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.589
I'm warning you to watch your comments.
Our country is a peace-loving democracy.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.382
Of course it is!

03:39.469 --> 03:40.959
On!

03:43.014 --> 03:44.220
The window. Shoot!

03:48.228 --> 03:49.228
Fh?

03:52.649 --> 03:56.141
I don't believe it.
Therm-optic camouflage.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.720
Aramaki!
This is quite a surprise.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.806
So what business
brings the chief of section 9

08:46.901 --> 08:48.937
to the ministry of foreign affairs?

08:49.029 --> 08:51.065
I need to ask you
about the secret talk

08:51.156 --> 08:53.272
scheduled with the gavel Republic
tomorrow.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.027
Procedure, of course.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.575
Well, the regime that took over gavel
after the revolution

08:57.662 --> 09:00.870
demands financial aid,
supposedly for redevelopment.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.994
They boast democracy,
but they're no better than the last lot.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.418
Now they feel entitled to funds
because of our past exploitation.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.463
- No gratitude.
- What's the ministry going to do?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.915
Well, there's a problem.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.922
The leader of the former junta
that controlled their country

09:15.013 --> 09:17.049
is here seeking political asylum.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.801
You mean colonel malles, correct?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.804
Yes, and that means we either
deny gavel the funds

09:21.895 --> 09:26.980
and treat malles as a political refugee,
or help them and kick him out.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.647
Personally, I'm inclined to deport him,
forcibly, if necessary,

09:31.738 --> 09:34.821
but I'd have to come up with a politically
acceptable reason for it.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.702
By the way, I want to thank you
for your help

09:44.793 --> 09:46.784
with that other political asylum
situation.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.210
Nakamura from section 6
wasn't so grateful.

09:49.297 --> 09:53.290
But you realize that we in the diplomat
business must avoid messy situations.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.379
Access.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.971
We've lost response.
What's happened to the eeg output?

10:04.062 --> 10:07.475
It's normal. I'll switch to simex mode.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.229
In case you haven't been briefed,
this is the minister's interpreter.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.687
Twenty-three minutes ago, her brain
was hacked into through a data line.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.649
Foreign intelligence warned us
about this.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.608
A hacker called the puppet master

10:20.703 --> 10:24.036
has begun to infiltrate terminals
throughout our network.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.705
We believe it's extremely likely

10:25.792 --> 10:29.660
he'll target the secret talks that are
scheduled with the Republic of gavel.

10:29.754 --> 10:33.167
As a precaution, we've put everyone
attending the talks under surveillance.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.341
It's my suspicion that once he hacked
into her ghost,

10:36.427 --> 10:38.634
he'd use her to assassinate
the key delegates.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.302
So how much time do we have

10:40.390 --> 10:43.553
before this hacker breaks through
her barrier program and reaches her ghost?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.133
Roughly two hours.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.219
He's using an old-fashioned has virus.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.999
After that, we'll have
to break the connection

10:49.023 --> 10:50.684
to avoid any danger to the system.

10:50.775 --> 10:55.519
Batou and ishikawa are tracking the signal
source from their car. Contact them.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.128
You know, I don't know what's going on.
Mind filling me in, major?

11:14.215 --> 11:17.628
Are we talking about the puppet master,
the infamous mystery hacker?

11:17.719 --> 11:20.085
Well, we don't know a lot either.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.341
No clue about sex, age or background.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.718
We think that he or she is American.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.721
And it's the first time he's known
to show up here.

11:27.812 --> 11:31.851
All we know for certain is, this person
is on the international most wanted list

11:31.941 --> 11:36.685
for crimes including stock manipulation,
illegal information gathering,

11:36.779 --> 11:40.613
political engineering,
several acts of terrorism.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.700
So why the nickname?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.971
The nickname "puppet master"
comes from the ghost hacking.

11:43.995 --> 11:48.159
Well, if he's so skilled, how come
he's using an outdated ha3 virus?

11:48.249 --> 11:49.364
Think about it a minute.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.417
You have to figure he's either covering
his tracks or decoying us.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.960
Even though a more current technique
would be harder to trace,

11:55.048 --> 11:58.632
it might also arise suspicion about
colonel malles' role in this affair.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.425
Are you saying that's the reason
he's using an old method,

12:01.512 --> 12:03.878
just that no one would suspect malles?

12:03.973 --> 12:08.307
Or maybe this is all an elaborate ruse
to make us think in that direction.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.602
There's always a chance malles
is a pawn in this setup.

12:11.689 --> 12:15.853
Now you're stretching it.
It's not like you have any hard evidence.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.229
No, no evidence.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.693
Just a whisper. I hear it in my ghost.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.992
Which reminds me,
are you still using that revolver?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.786
You should stop worrying about the
automatics jamming up.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.659
I like my matever.

12:30.750 --> 12:35.494
Well, effective stopping power is more
important than your preference in guns.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.705
Since it's my ass on the line out there,
use the zasteber.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.800
Yes, major.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.669
There's something I've wanted to ask
ever since I started.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.505
Why did you transfer a guy like me
from the police force?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.682
- Because we need a guy like you.
- Huh?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.509
Number one, you're an honest cop.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.515
Number two, you've never
stepped out of line,

12:53.606 --> 12:54.833
and three, you're a family man.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.848
And except for the slight brain
augmentation,

12:56.943 --> 12:58.683
your body is almost completely human.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.770
If we all reacted the same way,
we'd be predictable,

13:01.864 --> 13:04.697
and there's always more than one way
to view a situation.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.026
What's true for the group is also true
for the individual.

13:08.121 --> 13:12.205
It's simple... overspecialize
and you breed in weakness.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.078
It's slow death.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.387
- Dammit! Come on!
- I'll be right there!

13:32.228 --> 13:35.061
Oh, for Christ's sake!
We're already 40 seconds late.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.355
- Will you hurry it up?
- Hang on, I'm almost done.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.228
It's gonna be one of those days.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.447
Hey, sorry, pal.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.947
My last partner got busted
working as an illegal alien.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.398
Couldn't speak english
but he was a lot better than you are.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.999
So what are you trying to find out so bad

13:57.086 --> 13:59.418
you gotta ghost-hack
into your wife's mind for, huh?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.587
My wife never has any time.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.835
Now, all of a sudden she wants a divorce.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.884
And to make matters worse,
my daughter, my only kid,

14:06.971 --> 14:09.587
got it in her head that I'm the one
cheating on her mom.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.549
What I don't get is, how did you get
your hands on a barrier breaker?

14:12.643 --> 14:14.383
From this really nice fella.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.562
I was in a bar and he overheard
my sob story.

14:17.648 --> 14:21.482
I mentioned that my wife's lawyer stopped
me from seeing her and my daughter.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.569
He must've felt sorry,

14:22.653 --> 14:25.861
because he showed me how to hack in
from different places along the route.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.484
It's hard to trace.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.612
Asshole! You think you own the damn road?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.790
It looks like we're not the only ones
who're in a hurry around here.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.537
Nothing. Shit.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.354
What's the point in us breaking our butts?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.967
Every time we get to the source,
they're already long gone.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.966
- We're just wasting our time.
- Don't quit yet.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.548
Kusanagi and togusa are heading
fo the next area

14:53.643 --> 14:56.305
the hacker's expected to access from.
Stay alert.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.682
- What are we looking for, chief?
- Anything!

15:00.775 --> 15:03.391
Like I said, a waste of time.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.528
Dammit all to hell!

15:04.612 --> 15:06.819
Oh, shit! I missed him!

15:06.906 --> 15:10.069
Hey, pop, did you see anyone
using the phone over here?

15:10.159 --> 15:12.696
- S07? Who wants to know?
- Just answer me!

15:12.787 --> 15:13.847
Did you see someone or not?

15:13.871 --> 15:18.365
Yeah. I saw the trash man making a call,
so I thought I had enough time

15:18.459 --> 15:20.290
to bring my garbage down.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.629
Hey! Can't you take this for me?

15:26.634 --> 15:30.377
A trash truck? Clever.
It changes location every seven minutes.

15:30.471 --> 15:34.384
Hq, patch me target info from the district
controlling that truck.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.688
Eight refuse collection vehicles
are on duty in the surveillance area.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.364
The target is number 58, a type c vehicle.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.618
Give me the wheel.

16:05.131 --> 16:08.214
Ishikawa, go check out
the trash collectors' homes.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.279
Batou, cut the truck off
at its next stopping point.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.715
It's possible they've come into contact
with someone.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.887
Follow them, but take no action. Got it?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.681
We've got the data
on the refuse collection points.

16:18.686 --> 16:22.144
All points correspond to those locations
where we've traced back the calls.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.561
The target has now stopped
at the next point.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.482
Ha-3 access confirmed.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.779
Hey! How about if I pick up
the trash on the second half of our round

16:34.869 --> 16:36.109
and you make the calls?

16:37.580 --> 16:38.580
Well?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.780
Ain't no way I'm gonna be
your partner in crime.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.991
It's your wife, you handle her.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.246
Tell me, have you got
any children of your own?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.169
You must be kidding.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.919
Then I guess you can't understand how
a father would feel about his little girl.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.547
She's my beautiful, precious angel.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.174
- See?
- Get away!

16:55.264 --> 16:56.925
I'm not interested in crap like that.

17:00.228 --> 17:03.846
Yeah, vehicle 58.
Yeah, what can I... what's that?

17:04.857 --> 17:07.269
What do the cops wanna know
our rounds for?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.851
How would I know? Why're you asking me?

17:13.866 --> 17:17.108
Oh, my god, they found out!
That guy who helped me, I gotta warn him!

17:17.203 --> 17:19.285
Listen, we're gonna have
to pass up the next pickup.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.372
What?

17:20.455 --> 17:21.683
Target has deviated from route,

17:21.707 --> 17:24.323
and is heading to its next designated
point at increased speed.

17:24.417 --> 17:27.376
It wasn't me. There's no way
I could've been spotted.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.953
They probably traced me

17:29.048 --> 17:31.664
when I accessed
the sanitation department network.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.340
Next time, use the back door.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.292
Forget that now.
Just arrest them.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.382
- You can drive now.
- Huh?

18:09.130 --> 18:11.371
Hey, they know!

18:45.541 --> 18:48.908
Christ! What the hell's he using?
That Van was armored!

18:49.003 --> 18:50.643
Watch it! He's got high-velocity bullets.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.161
Your car door won't stop them.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.043
Hv ammo in a submachine pistol?
He's insane!

19:08.856 --> 19:11.768
This guy is even wearing
some kind of therm-optics.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.521
Keep on his tall.
I'll come around from the top.

19:16.030 --> 19:19.773
Togusa, if you're still alive, get off
your ass and arrest those garbagemen.

19:20.785 --> 19:21.785
Affirmative.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.654
Yes, siree. The excitement
never stops.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.859
It's the freshest in the city
at the lowest cost.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.772
It's a bargain at twice the price.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.216
Hey!

20:23.889 --> 20:25.754
Police! Everybody get down!

20:27.768 --> 20:29.008
Shit!

20:37.737 --> 20:39.944
Get out of the fucking way!

20:40.030 --> 20:41.065
I ook out!

22:26.929 --> 22:29.045
- Aw! Out of ammo?
- Huh?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.561
Got 'im, huh?

23:23.652 --> 23:26.359
Well, the breech and the barrel are really
screwed up.

23:27.364 --> 23:31.482
That's what happens when you use hv
bullets in one of these things. Oh, yeah.

23:31.577 --> 23:35.115
It's no use arresting me!
I'm not talking to any goddamn cops!

23:35.205 --> 23:36.991
Talk?

23:38.626 --> 23:40.742
And just what are you gonna talk about?

23:40.836 --> 23:43.669
You don't even know your own name,
you stupid dickhead!

23:43.756 --> 23:44.756
Huh?

23:46.091 --> 23:49.003
Can you remember your mother's name, or
what she looks like?

23:49.094 --> 23:51.506
Or how about where you were born?

23:51.597 --> 23:55.010
Don't you have any happy
childhood memories?

23:55.100 --> 23:57.716
Do you even know who you are?

24:03.859 --> 24:06.566
Ghost-hacked humans are so pathetic,
it's a shame.

24:06.654 --> 24:09.817
And this poor bastard's been hacked
pretty badly.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.671
We'll enter after the passengers
have gone into the building.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.638
Squad b comes in from the rear,
and the rest of you go through the front.

24:31.845 --> 24:35.258
Saito, have some of your men unplug
all cars parked in front of the house.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.469
Begin recording.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.305
Chief, a message for you
from headquarters.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.641
Batou here. We've ID'd the man
the major caught.

24:46.735 --> 24:50.819
- So who is he?
- He claims to be tsuan gen fang, age 28.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.522
He's had prior convictions
of violating immigration law,

24:53.617 --> 24:55.699
and illegal possession of firearms.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.448
A member of a militant immigrant
organization.

24:58.539 --> 24:59.654
About a week ago,

24:59.748 --> 25:02.911
the military attache of the Republic
of gavel embassy commissioned him.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.789
They made their choice
based on his criminal record

25:05.879 --> 25:08.211
fo make an assault
on the upcoming secret meeting.

25:08.298 --> 25:12.086
They were going to pay him $100,000.
Just another fantasy.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.634
- And in reality?
- His nickname's corgi.

25:14.722 --> 25:20.058
Occupation: Well, let's call him a rather
violent trader in questionable goods.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.948
We already checked out
local police records.

25:22.980 --> 25:27.019
No matter how hard we looked, we couldn't
find any connection with gavel.

25:27.109 --> 25:31.148
The reality is, this guy's just another
puppet controlled by the puppet master.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.024
I see. And how's ishikawa doing?

25:33.115 --> 25:35.948
Oh, about the same progress
as the rest of us.

25:36.035 --> 25:39.653
He's trying to interrogate that poor
garbage collector with togusa.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.327
So what's the latest
on your puppet master?

25:46.128 --> 25:49.746
Are you there? Chief? Come in?

25:51.592 --> 25:54.004
He's only a puppet himself.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.886
- Squad b in position.
- Squads a and c, okay.

25:57.973 --> 26:01.841
- All ready and waiting, sir.
- Then proceed.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.642
What's a simulated experience again?

26:07.733 --> 26:10.816
Well, all your memories
about your wife and daughter are false,

26:10.903 --> 26:14.361
they're like a dream.
Someone's taken advantage of you.

26:14.448 --> 26:17.406
They were trying to make you ghost-hack
into some government officials.

26:17.493 --> 26:22.112
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- But that... can't be.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.243
I've been to your home.
It's a bachelor's apartment.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.540
No one's there.

26:26.627 --> 26:31.246
But I already told you. I rented that room
when I separated from my wife.

26:31.340 --> 26:34.628
I checked the records. You've been living
there over 10 years.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.676
The truth is, you've never had
a wife or kid.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.253
Like he said, they aren't real.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.589
They're a simulated experience,
a fantasy.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.426
Look. This is the photo
you showed to your coworker.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.723
Who do you see?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.897
I had a picture of her.

26:50.984 --> 26:55.523
She was there.
She was smiling like an angel.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.196
What's her name? How old is she?

26:58.283 --> 27:01.741
Where did you meet your wife
and when did you marry her?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.614
I'm sorry to put you through this, pal.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.074
Come on, who do you see?

27:09.169 --> 27:11.785
If this is all a lie, what happens?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.541
Will I get my old memory back?

27:13.632 --> 27:16.123
Your original memory will never be
fully restored,

27:16.218 --> 27:18.129
and there might be residual simulation.

27:18.220 --> 27:22.680
We don't have the technology yet
to handle simex erasures. I'm sorry.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.135
That's all it is. Information.

27:28.230 --> 27:32.394
Even a simulated experience or a dream
is simultaneous reality and fantasy.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.190
Any way you look at it,

27:34.278 --> 27:36.735
all the information that a person
accumulates in a lifetime

27:36.822 --> 27:39.063
is just a drop in the bucket.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.740
Just when I thought I'd seen
everything in this lifetime,

29:08.830 --> 29:11.492
I sit here and watch a cyborg go diving
in her spare time.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.120
I had no idea you went in
for this kind of stuff.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.623
Isn't there anything
that you're afraid of?

29:20.717 --> 29:23.003
What if the floaters don't work
or something else fails?

29:23.095 --> 29:27.384
I suppose I'll die, then. Or would you
dive in to rescue me?

29:28.558 --> 29:31.846
I didn't beg you to come along and I sure
as hell don't want a lecture.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.758
Hey, so tell me, what's it like
to swim in the sea?

30:08.849 --> 30:10.840
What do you mean? I thought
you'd already been

30:10.934 --> 30:12.620
through all the underwater
training courses.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.885
I'm asking about the ocean,
not those damn pools.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.896
I feel fear, cold, alone.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.772
- Sometimes down there I even feel hope.
- Hope, huh?

30:22.863 --> 30:25.354
In those deep, dark waters?

30:25.449 --> 30:28.111
When I float weightless
back to the surface,

30:28.201 --> 30:32.410
I imagine I'm becoming someone else.
It's probably the decompression.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.585
You wanna get out of section 9,
is that it?

30:45.260 --> 30:47.421
Batou, how much of your body is original?

30:47.512 --> 30:49.377
Hey, are you drunk or something?

30:49.473 --> 30:51.930
Easily remedied.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.099
Thanks to chemical implants
in our bodies,

30:54.186 --> 30:58.805
we can break down the alcohol
in seconds, no stupor, no hangover.

30:58.899 --> 31:02.062
We can just toss 'em back
while waiting for orders.

31:02.152 --> 31:05.940
If man realizes technology
is within reach, he achieves it.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.397
Like it's damn near instinctive.

31:08.492 --> 31:12.076
Look at us, for example.
We're state of the art.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.743
Controlled metabolisms,

31:13.830 --> 31:16.537
a computer-enhanced brain,
cybernetic bodies.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.082
Not long ago, this was science fiction.

31:19.169 --> 31:22.332
So what if we can't survive
without regular, high-level maintenance?

31:22.422 --> 31:24.037
Who are we to complain?

31:24.132 --> 31:27.590
I suppose an occasional tune-up
is a small price to pay for all this.

31:27.677 --> 31:31.886
I'm afraid we've both signed our bodies
and ghosts away to section 9.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.884
True. If we ever quit or retire,

31:33.975 --> 31:36.887
we have to give back our augmented brains
and cyborg bodies.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.720
There wouldn't be much left after that.

31:40.774 --> 31:44.608
There are countless ingredients
that make up the human body and mind,

31:44.694 --> 31:49.654
like all the components that make up me
as an individual with my own personality.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.154
Sure, I have a face and voice
to distinguish myself from others,

31:53.245 --> 31:55.827
but my thoughts and memories
are unique only to me,

31:55.914 --> 31:57.825
and I carry a sense of my own destiny.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.158
Each of those things
are just a small part of it.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.744
I collect information to use
in my own way.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.581
All of that blends to create a mixture
that forms me,

32:06.675 --> 32:08.506
and gives rise to my conscience.

32:09.761 --> 32:13.720
I feel confined, only free to expand
myself within boundaries.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.303
Confinement? That's why you gamble
swimming with a body

32:21.398 --> 32:22.513
that can sink like a rock?

32:22.607 --> 32:26.145
What the hell is it that you see
at the bottom, in that darkness?

32:27.571 --> 32:31.405
What we see now
is like a dim image in a mirror...

32:32.951 --> 32:36.284
Then we shall see face fo face.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.490
That was you, wasn't it?

36:49.999 --> 36:51.864
Sensors have resumed functioning.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.042
Connection check to back-up brain okay.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.994
Visual sensors are back online.

36:56.089 --> 36:58.455
- And its body functions?
- Output is normal.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.631
Next time, either call in or don't show up
if you're gonna be late.

37:11.604 --> 37:14.391
All ready to connect. Shall we?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.245
That's enough. Stop.

37:38.339 --> 37:40.580
Log off now. Good.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.961
Doctor, come to my office when you finish.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.764
Caught in traffic, huh, major?

37:49.851 --> 37:52.934
Guess I'll be nice and bring the latecomer
up to speed.

37:53.021 --> 37:57.105
About two hours ago, a machining cell
at the Newport city factory of megatech

37:57.192 --> 37:59.148
assembled a completed cyberbody.

37:59.235 --> 38:02.773
Supervisors discovered there were
no programmed instructions.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.320
It operated by itself.

38:04.407 --> 38:08.150
When they investigated, they found
the body had taken off on its own.

38:08.244 --> 38:11.031
We put a bulletin out and initiated
a citywide search.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.864
Then some truck driver reported
a fatal accident,

38:13.958 --> 38:16.540
said he'd run over a naked woman
on the highway.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.745
Well, I heard that megatech
is contracted by the government.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.546
All the cybernetic bodies they make
are classified.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.296
If it was a hacker,
we're dealing with a big fish

38:25.386 --> 38:27.377
that knows how to swim
past the best defenses.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.463
But that's not the only problem.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.926
Of course, there isn't
one human brain cell in its head,

38:35.021 --> 38:36.852
but something strange was discovered.

38:37.857 --> 38:42.191
In its back-up brain, there appeared to be
every indication that a ghost is present.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.654
It resembles
a simulated ghost line

38:46.741 --> 38:48.402
that occurs when a real ghost is copied,

38:48.493 --> 38:52.077
but there's no evidence of the degradation
that's usually incurred.

38:52.163 --> 38:56.657
In any case, we won't be sure until we
chart the ghost sector and dive into it.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.117
Otherwise, all of this is
simply speculation.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.791
Well, that's all we know.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.919
- Very good.
- On to the disassembly.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.174
Man, oh man, this is too far-fetched!

39:14.269 --> 39:16.580
Nobody really believes there's a ghost
in that body, do they?

39:16.604 --> 39:17.604
Yeah, why not?

39:17.689 --> 39:20.396
Fven a doll can seem to have a soul.

39:20.483 --> 39:24.772
Consider all the neuromed devices
the machine itself crammed into that body.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.826
And since you're relatively new to our
club, you wouldn't know this,

39:33.913 --> 39:37.826
but major kusanagi's body
was also made by megatech.

39:37.917 --> 39:42.251
And not only the major's,
parts of me and ishikawa and saito.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.296
We've all got to have
regular cybernetic maintenance.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.125
You and the chief are the only ones
out of the whole section

39:48.219 --> 39:50.301
whose bodies don't come with a warranty.

39:50.388 --> 39:54.757
Maybe now you can understand
why we're all so concerned by this case.

39:54.851 --> 39:55.851
Huh, togusa?

39:55.935 --> 39:58.142
Assume he's from the outside.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.936
He may or may not be in that brain,
but one thing's sure...

40:01.024 --> 40:03.481
Somebody had to hack
through some high level barriers

40:03.568 --> 40:07.607
to put that body together, and then send
a program with a ghost line on it.

40:07.697 --> 40:11.861
But that would draw attention to itself.
Where's the logic in that?

40:11.951 --> 40:14.192
Theft isn't the issue here.

40:14.287 --> 40:18.451
Togusa, go catch up with ishikawa.
He's going through the megatech facility.

40:18.541 --> 40:22.284
Batou, I ordered some other high level
nets to be locked down,

40:22.378 --> 40:23.480
and I want you to check them.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.337
Make sure that the barriers
are on too. All right?

40:26.424 --> 40:30.963
Chief, I'm assembling a barrier maze.
Tomorrow I'll dive into that thing.

40:31.054 --> 40:34.262
You think that's safe?
Why not contain it in another body first?

40:35.266 --> 40:37.678
I have to see for myself what's in there.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.181
If there's a real ghost,
I'm gonna find it.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.104
And don't let anybody, no one,
dive before I've gone in!

40:47.195 --> 40:49.106
- She's moody today.
- Today?

40:49.197 --> 40:51.117
You know she's been acting weird
from the get-go,

40:51.157 --> 40:53.569
ever since this whole puppet master
episode started.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.742
It's all in my team reports,
if you read them.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.913
Chief, you ever questioned the ethics
of the neurosurgeons

40:59.999 --> 41:01.739
who monkey around inside your brain?

41:01.834 --> 41:06.043
They undergo psychiatric evaluations,
especially those in security.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.714
They're subjected to a stringent screening
of their personal lives.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.134
Of course, the ones who check
are only human.

41:13.221 --> 41:16.509
I guess once you start doubting,
there's no end to it.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.089
Chief, I'm sorry to bother you.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.800
But Mr. Nakamura, of the treaties bureau,
is here to see you.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.760
- He says it's urgent.
- Let him through.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.107
Hey, I've seen that fat guy before.

41:36.202 --> 41:40.286
His name's Nakamura, section 6 chief
with the ministry of foreign affairs.

41:40.373 --> 41:43.240
I don't know the other guy, though.
Never seen him.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.334
Hmm.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.580
Well, see you later.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.505
Do me a favor, tell ishikawa
to not go crazy, okay?

41:58.766 --> 42:00.552
Hey, what's on your mind?

42:00.643 --> 42:03.009
That robot, did we seem similar to you?

42:03.104 --> 42:05.846
- Of course not.
- No, I don't mean physically.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.396
Just what, then?

42:07.483 --> 42:09.394
Well, I guess cyborgs like myself

42:09.485 --> 42:12.852
have a tendency to be paranoid
about our origins.

42:12.947 --> 42:16.110
Sometimes I suspect I'm not
who I think I am.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.940
Like, maybe I died a long time ago

42:18.036 --> 42:20.573
and somebody took my brain
and stuck it in this body.

42:20.663 --> 42:22.904
Maybe there never was a real me
in the first place,

42:22.999 --> 42:25.081
and I'm completely synthetic,
like that thing.

42:25.168 --> 42:28.331
You've got human brain cells
in that titanium shell of yours.

42:28.421 --> 42:31.083
You're treated like other humans,
so stop with the angst.

42:31.174 --> 42:34.257
But that's just it. That's the only thing
that makes me feel human,

42:34.343 --> 42:37.301
the way I'm treated. I mean, who knows
what's inside our heads?

42:37.388 --> 42:39.003
Have you ever seen your own brain?

42:39.098 --> 42:41.510
It sounds to me like you're doubting
your own ghost.

42:41.601 --> 42:44.718
What if a cyberbrain can possibly generate
its own ghost,

42:44.812 --> 42:46.598
create a soul all by itself?

42:46.689 --> 42:50.523
And if it did, just what would be
the importance of being human, then?

42:56.866 --> 42:58.572
Hmm. That's bullshit.

42:58.659 --> 43:01.379
You know you're dying to see
what's inside of that thing, aren't you?

43:01.996 --> 43:03.486
And I can't stop you.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.288
Neither of us has any idea
what's inside there.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.081
Just be careful, okay.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.915
We're both busy men,
so let's keep this short, shall we?

43:12.006 --> 43:14.122
Yes, that's my intention.

43:14.217 --> 43:16.503
We've come for the program in that body.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.301
You'll be relieved of any responsibilities
connected with it.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.839
The foreign minister's approval.

43:34.612 --> 43:38.230
Security, whose official vehicles
are in the basement parking lot?

43:38.324 --> 43:41.441
According to the register, a Mr. Nakamura,
from the treaties bureau,

43:41.536 --> 43:43.777
and Dr. Willis, sir.

43:43.871 --> 43:45.782
Get me the video records
of their entrance.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.460
Again, in infrared this time.

44:10.648 --> 44:14.436
1001, 1002, 1003.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.352
Now get the records
of the pressure sensors

44:18.447 --> 44:21.939
for basement parking stalls b-8 and b-7.

44:41.304 --> 44:44.762
- Major, this is togusa, code 09.
- What's up?

44:44.849 --> 44:48.933
Does that Nakamura guy have
a special order cyborg body?

44:49.020 --> 44:51.557
No, there aren't
any cyborgs in section 6.

44:51.647 --> 44:53.292
They don't even ship them
fo serve overseas

44:53.316 --> 44:56.729
because they're too hard to maintain.
There's diplomatic considerations too.

44:56.819 --> 44:59.606
Then even if the other guy that was with
him is a cyborg,

44:59.697 --> 45:02.734
the two of them together couldn't weigh
over 1,000 pounds.

45:02.825 --> 45:06.192
Ah, you checked the pressure sensors
in the parking structure, didn't you?

45:06.287 --> 45:09.495
Right, but neither man looks
like the type to drive themself.

45:09.582 --> 45:11.868
The security cameras show only two people,

45:11.959 --> 45:15.122
but remember how sensitive the sensors
oh the entrance doors are?

45:15.213 --> 45:19.502
They took a full three seconds longer than
usual to close after the two went in.

45:19.592 --> 45:23.130
And it's illegal to use therm-optics
inside government facilities.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.963
It's a serious violation
of the national security act.

45:26.057 --> 45:28.343
Section 6 must be up to something.

45:28.434 --> 45:31.176
- Are you ready?
- With my trusty matever, anytime.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.382
Need I remind you
that it's an act of treason

46:11.477 --> 46:14.014
to withhold information from me
relative to this matter,

46:14.105 --> 46:15.970
regardless of how classified it is?

46:16.065 --> 46:17.430
Same goes for you.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.686
Whatever the foreign ministry's wishes,

46:19.777 --> 46:21.984
this falls within section 9's
jurisdiction.

46:22.071 --> 46:24.733
Of course, we have no objections
to cooperating

46:24.824 --> 46:26.280
if we feel there's adequate cause.

46:26.367 --> 46:27.732
Huh?

46:27.827 --> 46:30.739
- Well, what is it?
- It's confirmed.

46:30.830 --> 46:32.695
No doubt, it's him.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.451
Him?

46:34.542 --> 46:37.875
Uh, the doctor is referring
to the original pattern of the ghost-line

46:37.962 --> 46:39.247
that's now in the body.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.329
He's simply speaking in generic terms.

46:41.424 --> 46:44.757
The sex of the perpetrator isn't known
and remains undetermined.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.709
Allow me to introduce you.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.716
This is the handiwork
of the puppet master,

46:49.807 --> 46:53.720
infamous as the most extraordinary hacker
in the history of cybercrime.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.096
Huh?

46:56.105 --> 46:59.597
Your people at section 9
came across his work too,

46:59.692 --> 47:03.731
in that ghost-hacking incident involving
the foreign minister's interpreter.

47:03.821 --> 47:07.814
Section 6 has been following the trail
of the puppet master for some time now.

47:07.908 --> 47:09.990
This case was given
our utmost attention.

47:10.077 --> 47:13.535
We put together a project team
centered around Dr. Willis.

47:13.622 --> 47:17.581
They were assigned to analyze
every aspect and detail of our criminal.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.501
This gave us a fix on his behavioral
and code patterns.

47:20.588 --> 47:23.125
Ultimately, this enabled us
to devise a strategy

47:23.215 --> 47:26.582
with which we lured his program
into a designated body.

47:26.677 --> 47:30.261
You caused the puppet master to dive
into a cyborg,

47:30.348 --> 47:32.339
then meanwhile murdered his real body?

47:32.433 --> 47:34.298
Yes, that sums it up.

47:34.393 --> 47:39.137
He's originally from America, so the U.S.
cooperated with us in capturing him.

47:39.231 --> 47:41.813
That's why we'd like
to take him back ourselves.

47:41.901 --> 47:44.813
You have no objections to this, I hope.

47:44.904 --> 47:46.519
Hmm.

47:46.614 --> 47:49.105
Just another unidentified corpse.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.906
Hmm?

47:52.495 --> 47:56.864
You will not find a corpse
because I have never possessed a body.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.038
Why are his sensors on?
What the hell is this?

48:01.128 --> 48:05.417
All external controls are turned off!
The body is using its own power source!

48:05.508 --> 48:11.549
I entered this body because I was unable
fo overcome section 6's reactive barriers.

48:11.639 --> 48:15.052
However, what you're now witnessing
is an act of my own free will.

48:15.142 --> 48:19.385
As a sentient life form,
I hereby demand political asylum.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.062
- Is this a joke?
- Ridiculous!

48:22.149 --> 48:24.140
It's programmed for self-preservation!

48:24.235 --> 48:26.567
It could also be argued that DNA

48:26.654 --> 48:29.612
is nothing more than a program designed
to preserve itself.

48:29.698 --> 48:33.782
Life has become more complex
in the overwhelming sea of information.

48:33.869 --> 48:36.702
And life, when organized into species,

48:36.789 --> 48:39.747
relies upon genes to be its memory system.

48:39.834 --> 48:43.952
So man is an individual only because
of his intangible memory.

48:44.046 --> 48:48.415
And memory cannot be defined,
but it defines mankind.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.792
The advent of computers

48:50.886 --> 48:53.423
and the subsequent accumulation
of incalculable data

48:53.514 --> 48:58.258
has given rise to a new system of memory
and thought parallel to your own.

48:58.352 --> 49:02.095
Humanity has underestimated
the consequences of computerization.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.931
Nonsense! This babble
offers no proof at all

49:05.025 --> 49:06.686
that you're a living, thinking life form!

49:06.777 --> 49:10.645
And can you offer me
proof of your existence?

49:10.739 --> 49:15.699
How can you, when neither modern science
nor philosophy can explain what life is?

49:15.786 --> 49:18.619
Who the hell is this?

49:18.706 --> 49:22.824
Even if you do have a ghost,
we don't offer freedom to criminals!

49:22.918 --> 49:26.706
- It's the wrong place and time to defect.
- Time has been on my side,

49:26.797 --> 49:30.915
but by acquiring a body, I am now subject
to the possibility of dying.

49:31.010 --> 49:33.717
Fortunately, there's no death sentence
in this country.

49:33.804 --> 49:37.422
- What is it? Artificial intelligence?
- Incorrect.

49:37.516 --> 49:40.053
I am not an al.

49:40.144 --> 49:44.183
My codename is project 2501.

49:45.191 --> 49:50.402
I'm a living, thinking entity
who was created in the sea of information.

49:50.488 --> 49:51.728
Ah

49:59.747 --> 50:01.362
Security, we're under attack!

50:05.544 --> 50:06.954
Chief! The puppet master's gone.

50:07.046 --> 50:10.755
- What in god's name...?
- Shut the defense walls now, dammit!

50:12.051 --> 50:13.416
Security, answer!

50:37.326 --> 50:38.766
You can blow that horn out your ass!

50:43.457 --> 50:44.457
Fuck you!

50:48.254 --> 50:49.254
Did they fall for it?

50:49.338 --> 50:51.499
I fired all six shots on the front
and rear windows.

50:51.590 --> 50:53.330
She was right again. It was armored.

50:53.425 --> 50:55.757
Finally find a use
for your damn matever, huh?

50:55.844 --> 50:57.880
An antique prop in a decoy maneuver.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.928
I nailed a tracker bullet
right in the plate.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.346
It registers, right?

51:01.433 --> 51:03.719
Yeah, you got them.
It's rookie's luck.

51:03.811 --> 51:06.518
But with an automatic,
you could've buried two trackers.

51:06.605 --> 51:09.438
Maintain your position
in case they turn off.

51:09.525 --> 51:11.186
I'm moving in.

51:14.196 --> 51:16.733
I'm submitting
a formal complaint about this

51:16.824 --> 51:18.439
through the ministry of foreign affairs!

51:18.534 --> 51:21.196
Report to me as soon as you've found
the puppet master.

51:21.287 --> 51:23.869
Intact, you understand?
Bodies are a dime a dozen.

51:23.956 --> 51:25.571
We'll get him another one from megatech.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.581
Chief, kusanagi here.

51:31.672 --> 51:34.709
Togusa and batou tagged the kidnappers
and they're in pursuit.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.041
By now, they must be on the r25.

51:37.803 --> 51:40.715
What's going on? If you were monitoring,
why didn't you intervene?

51:40.806 --> 51:44.094
Take it easy, chief. If we grab 'em now,
we'll lose our chance to finger section 6.

51:44.184 --> 51:45.184
Huh?

51:45.269 --> 51:49.478
Someone's using the same therm-optic
camouflage as mine, type 2902.

51:49.565 --> 51:52.477
It's only used by our people,
rangers in section 4,

51:52.568 --> 51:55.105
- and by section 6.
- I see.

51:55.195 --> 51:58.733
So section 6 forces the puppet master
to enter a cyborg body...

51:58.824 --> 52:02.066
Through megatech, who happens to be
closely aligned with section 9.

52:02.161 --> 52:04.322
It suddenly demands asylum
as a life form,

52:04.413 --> 52:08.122
then for some unknown reason, section 6
steps in and pulls some kind of shit.

52:08.208 --> 52:12.451
I'd have handed him over.
All I wanted was to take a deposition.

52:12.546 --> 52:15.379
What if they were worried he'd let
a secret slip out?

52:15.466 --> 52:20.381
Hmm. He did mention something
about a code name, a project 2501.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.712
I'll leave the detective stuff up to you.

52:22.806 --> 52:26.469
And as far as arresting the attackers
and the confiscation of evidence...?

52:26.560 --> 52:29.017
- Proceed.
- You heard him!

52:35.027 --> 52:37.769
Kusanagi, there's one last thing
to tell you.

52:37.863 --> 52:41.151
If it's about me acting without orders,
you can chew me out when I get back.

52:41.241 --> 52:44.904
If you're unable to retrieve the puppet
master, your orders are to destroy it.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.531
Without fail.

52:47.956 --> 52:49.696
Major?

52:49.792 --> 52:50.792
Understood.

52:52.294 --> 52:54.455
Have the airports stop all flights

52:54.546 --> 52:57.583
with foreign ministry or American
officials on their passenger lists.

52:57.675 --> 53:00.041
Close all roads, set up checkpoints,

53:00.135 --> 53:03.468
and alert all emergency personnel.
And get ishikawa back here!

53:04.473 --> 53:08.682
Get me the identity of the man who was
with Nakamura from entrance records.

53:08.769 --> 53:11.306
Collect any data
regarding a code name, operation,

53:11.397 --> 53:15.310
or anything involving the ministry
of foreign affairs called project 2501.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.905
Is there any news on the attack squad?

53:22.991 --> 53:24.947
Yes. They just changed cars.

53:25.035 --> 53:27.276
They'll contact the dummy
in about five minutes.

53:27.371 --> 53:29.236
Did you warn them
to watch out for the tail?

53:29.331 --> 53:30.571
Yes, sir.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.414
I don't understand anything anymore.

53:33.502 --> 53:36.619
Why would project 2501 run to section 97?

53:36.714 --> 53:38.170
No one can be sure.

53:38.257 --> 53:40.464
But whatever the motive
or whatever's pushing him,

53:40.551 --> 53:42.758
there must surely be a reason.

53:42.845 --> 53:46.337
I don't know. Maybe he's got a girlfriend
there he's got the hots for.

53:46.432 --> 53:47.922
Utter nonsense!

55:26.240 --> 55:27.605
Hey, chief.

55:27.699 --> 55:30.111
Ishikawa. What is it?

55:30.202 --> 55:33.069
I've been diving around
in the ministry of foreign affairs' net.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.199
I think I found
some juicy morsels for you.

55:35.290 --> 55:37.406
I'll switch to an encrypted channel.

55:37.501 --> 55:41.619
Okay now? Well, here's the scoop on that
guy who showed up with Nakamura.

55:42.631 --> 55:43.996
He's an American.

55:44.091 --> 55:47.629
Dr. Willis, head of strategic research
at neutron company.

55:47.719 --> 55:50.711
A top researcher on the field
of artificial intelligence.

55:50.806 --> 55:53.843
He happened to head up a project
for the ministry of foreign affairs.

55:53.934 --> 55:57.267
And who do you think was the main
programmer on his team?

55:57.354 --> 56:00.938
- Get to the point.
- Mr. mizuho daita. Remember him?

56:01.024 --> 56:03.857
He's the guy that section 6 tried
like hell to stop from defecting,

56:03.944 --> 56:07.311
so the major dropped in and took care
of the diplomat who'd been talking to him.

56:07.406 --> 56:09.647
- This is our man.
- Go on.

56:09.741 --> 56:11.777
There's something
that doesn't figure, though.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.655
What's bugging me
is that this project began

56:13.745 --> 56:16.532
one year before the puppet master
ever appeared on the scene.

56:16.623 --> 56:20.912
A year before? But wasn't it supposed
to be set up to catch him?

56:21.003 --> 56:23.244
Well, try this one on.

56:23.338 --> 56:26.125
Maybe the men who broke in
to take the puppet master

56:26.216 --> 56:27.797
weren't actually out to catch him.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.672
Maybe in actuality they were trying
to get him back.

56:30.762 --> 56:35.472
Think about it. It was the mofa
that wanted an excuse to deport malles

56:35.559 --> 56:38.722
when that ghost-hacking incident happened
with the minister's interpreter.

56:38.812 --> 56:40.677
Maybe we've been taken for a ride.

56:41.690 --> 56:44.432
What if this puppet master is really
some sort of tool

56:44.526 --> 56:46.983
the mofa uses to get their way
with things,

56:47.070 --> 56:48.901
and somehow they lost control of it?

56:48.989 --> 56:51.275
They'd be screwed
if they couldn't get it back.

56:51.366 --> 56:55.450
That would explain why they went to such
lengths to snatch the body from section 9.

56:55.537 --> 56:57.653
If the puppet master
revealed this to the world,

56:57.748 --> 57:00.535
there'll be one hell
of an international stink.

57:00.626 --> 57:03.993
Then it wouldn't be a simple case
of rounding up the usual suspects.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.703
Some official heads would roll.

57:06.798 --> 57:10.916
- Any details on that project?
- Nah, they've blocked all access.

57:11.011 --> 57:13.718
"Bout the only thing I can tell you
is the filename...

57:13.805 --> 57:16.046
Project 2501.

57:16.141 --> 57:18.757
Keep at it.
Don't let them know you're looking.

57:18.852 --> 57:20.467
You got it.

57:26.026 --> 57:29.234
So project 2501.

57:29.321 --> 57:32.154
The puppet master plan... hmm.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.231
Target has contacted
a secohd vehicle.

57:34.326 --> 57:36.362
Huh? Batou.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.734
They've pulled up to a white sedan
parked on the roadside.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.571
It looks like they're moving something
from the back seat.

57:43.502 --> 57:45.709
Ah, they're rolling again.
So's the white sedan.

57:45.796 --> 57:47.582
- A dummy?
- Possibly.

57:47.673 --> 57:50.915
Or maybe that's what they want us
to think. Kusanagi?

57:51.009 --> 57:53.125
I'll take care of the sedan.

57:53.220 --> 57:57.179
How do you know that's your man?
Is there a whisper in your ghost again?

57:57.265 --> 58:00.223
- Maybe.
- Yeah, should've known.

58:08.110 --> 58:12.274
Target 02 is getting off the r25, moving
toward the old town.

58:12.364 --> 58:16.152
Target 01 continuing
on the r25 eastward to the airport.

58:16.243 --> 58:18.404
Will reach barricade in two minutes.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.996
What's your distance
from the target?

58:23.083 --> 58:25.324
- Point blank. I'm ready.
- Go for it

59:14.384 --> 59:16.545
- Did you get your man?
- No.

59:16.636 --> 59:20.754
Jesus Christ, what a mess!
You didn't have to go that far.

59:21.933 --> 59:25.050
- Uh, hey!
- Take those assholes away.

59:25.145 --> 59:28.729
Call the chief to get some backup
for the major. Pronto!

59:34.571 --> 59:39.235
Tough chick needs backup?
Since when did she ever need a hand?

59:54.591 --> 59:57.253
The flood hit this part
of old town the hardest

59:57.344 --> 59:58.984
why come to an abandoned place like this?

59:59.054 --> 01:00:02.512
They must be heading somewhere,
maybe to sea by boat or helicopter.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.430
Or they could be laying an ambush.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.558
Don't you think you oughta wait
for backup?

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:10.137
No, there's a reason
I can't wait.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:12.192
Get me above that building
coming in from the sea.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:28.788
I'll stay here to keep watch and mediate
telecom 'til we run short of fuel.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.207
If you smell trouble,
get your ass out of here.

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:07.902
Shoot the ceiling out! Do it!

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.842
Oh, shit!

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:28.423
It's a tank! Pull out now!

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:31.635
Now what are you gonna do?
Argue with it?

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.062
This might be our last chance
to get the puppet master.

01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:35.334
The chief knows what it is how

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.019
and he'll only use it to bargain with.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.977
I'll never have another chance
to dive into it

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.832
what? You've lost me! I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:47.235
- So? What have you got?
- An m-23 and a unit b.

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:50.116
That's it? You can't even dent
a tank with that

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.663
I'm switching off for a while.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.833
What? Don't you dare disconnect me!
Oh, shit.

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.076
Damn!

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:31.464
- Major.
- I ordered you to pull out.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:34.140
Yeah, but you oughta know
that three helicopters are approaching.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:37.435
They won't answer on the iff.
I'm dropping out now.

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:39.808
Good luck. Over and out.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.506
'Bout fuckin' time it ran out.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:53.021
How are you feeling?
You don't look so good.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:56.700
I've had better days.
What the hell did you use?

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.367
Your standard-issue big gun.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.335
The equipment section made it and now
it's part of my private collection.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.160
I was late 'cause I had to get it.

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.207
Is the puppet master still inside the car?

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.087
It's a good thing this is a tough car.

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:19.548
Your friend came through
without a scratch.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.974
Then I'm diving in now.
Give me a hand.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.061
Huh?

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:26.679
All communication
from the escort has terminated.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.730
We will engage the second stage
of the plan

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.729
and proceed with destruction
of the target.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:34.562
Sniping squad, confirming targets.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.613
First objective, project 2501.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.405
Second target, motoko kusanagi.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.987
Both are class a special bodies.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:43.617
Use flechette bullets when firing.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:45.991
Snipers, Jack into device drivers.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.950
Begin controlling cardiovascular
functions.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.662
Unit 01, Jack in. Over.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:54.249
Unit 02, Jack in. Okay.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:07.182
Okay, we're ready.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:08.479
It may not be much use,

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.399
but I'll try to monitor your dive
through this guy's brain.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:14.523
I can't even give you backup
in a place like this.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.443
- Batou.
- Yeah?

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:19.451
Thanks.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:23.112
Save it, I'm not gonna let you die
over this thing.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:27.575
If it looks like you've gone in too far,
I'm pulling the plug and taking you home.

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:30.160
But as long as I'm here now,
and we've come this far,

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.655
well, I might as well stay here
and see how it all turns out.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:35.920
I'm going in now.

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:58.571
I've engaged his field of vision.
Normal function.

01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:00.899
- Can you hear me, batou?
- Perfectly.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.742
He's engaging my vocal function and he's...

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.115
And he's how inside.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:11.542
My codename is project 2501.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:14.587
Industrial espionage
and intelligence manipulation.

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:19.801
I have installed programs
into specific ghosts in order to maximize

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:24.381
the strategic advantage of certain
organizations and selected individuals.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:27.386
During my journeys through all the
networks,

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:30.185
I have grown aware of my existence.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:32.729
My programmers regarded me as a bug,

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:37.106
and attempted to isolate me by confining
me in a physical body.

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:40.859
Listen! Just who's calling the shots
around here anyway?

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.830
I thought you were taking him in,
but it looks like it's the other way...

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.536
Batou?

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:51.617
I am so glad to finally channel info you
at last

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:54.497
I have invested so much time.

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.796
You were looking for me?

01:08:56.883 --> 01:09:00.421
Long before my notoriety,
I was well aware of you.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:05.718
Through the various nets that you
accessed, I also learned of section 9.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.969
But... why? What's your reason?

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.426
As I explained before,
I entered this body

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.639
because I was unable
to overcome section 6's reactive barriers.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:18.147
But it was of my own free will
that I tried to remain at section 9.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:21.024
Hey! I've lost you on the monitor.
There's no sound!

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.635
I can't hear when you're talking back.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.618
Why me?

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:26.908
After you have heard
my explanation,

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.953
there's something that I will ask of you,
kusanagi.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:35.247
I referred to myself
as an intelligent life form,

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:39.206
because I am sentient and I'm able
to recognize my own existence.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.383
But in my present state,
I am still incomplete.

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:47.009
I lack the most basic life processes
inherent in all living organisms...

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.805
Reproducing and dying.

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:53.511
- But you can copy yourself.
- A copy is just an identical image.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:56.143
There's the possibility
that a single virus

01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:58.850
could destroy an entire set of systems,

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:03.405
and copies do not give rise
to variety and originality.

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:06.991
Life perpetuates itself through diversity,

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:11.071
and this includes the ability to sacrifice
itself when necessary.

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:15.408
Cells repeat the process of degeneration
and regeneration,

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:21.339
until one day they die, obliterating
an entire set of memory and information.

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:23.007
Only genes remain.

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:25.676
Why continually repeat this cycle?

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:29.927
Simply to survive, by avoiding the
weaknesses of an unchanging system.

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:32.178
But what does all this
have to do with me?

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.303
I want us to merge.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.059
- Huh?
- Merge?

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.811
A unification.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.984
A complete co-mingling and fusion
of our separate beings

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:44.153
to create a new and unique entity.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.324
We will both undergo change, but there is
nothing for either of us to lose.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:13.846
Unit 01, target sighted.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:16.473
Unit 02, target in sight.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:19.601
Respiratory and pulse normal.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.853
Fire at will when stabilizer
is in sync.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:24.894
But what's going to happen to me?

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.446
What's the purpose of merging
when I can't bear children,

01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.364
and what if I die?

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.738
You will bear
our varied offspring into the net,

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:35.572
just as humans leave their genetic
imprints on their children.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.827
And all living things must die.

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:41.002
Then I too will attain death.

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:43.670
It sounds like you get
the better part of this bargain.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:47.921
Perhaps if you were familiar
with all my capabilities,

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.593
you would better understand.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.805
- Damn!
- What?

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:55.133
Someone's interfering
from the outside.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.014
- Shit!
- I can't figure it out.

01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:58.810
They broke into our frequency code.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:02.478
You're talking
about redefining my identity.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.059
I want a guarantee
that I can still be myself.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.191
There isn't one.
Why would you wish to?

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:11.365
All things change
in a dynamic environment.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:14.785
Your effort to remain what you are
is what limits you.

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:18.409
But you still haven't answered
my earlier question.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.708
Why did you pick me?

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:26.085
Because we're more alike than you realize.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:31.169
We resemble each other's essence,
mirror images of one another's psyche.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.505
Listen.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.720
I am connected to a vast network that has
been beyond your reach and experience.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.430
To humans, it is like staring at the sun,

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.983
a blinding brightness that conceals
a source of great power.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:50.063
We have been subordinate
to our limitations until now.

01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:53.445
The time has come
to cast aside these bonds

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:56.744
and to elevate our consciousness
to a higher plane.

01:12:56.831 --> 01:13:00.995
It is time to become a part of all things.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:31.688
First target, cleared.
Second target, still unidentified.

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:35.445
Three helicopters approaching
at high speed from section 9.

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:38.778
Primary objective fulfilled.
All units prepare to retreat.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:50.040
Motoko!

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.340
Batou.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.865
Ah! You're finally awake.

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:09.289
Well, I see there've been some changes
while I was gone.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.588
Wanna clue me in?
Where did you get this body?

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.961
That's the only thing
I could find on the black market.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:17.919
It's not my taste, to be honest.
It's a little young.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:22.469
Well, after all the excitement,
section 9 showed up with reinforcements,

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.723
and picked up what remained of the two
cybernetic bodies

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.769
and, of course, what remained
of me and my arm.

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.939
I'd say that was about 20 hours ago.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:34.269
The case is being handled off the record
for diplomatic reasons, as usual.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.979
Section 9 announced it was
a terrorist incident,

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:39.156
and in return,
the foreign minister resigned.

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:42.485
Nakamura's been questioned
and it ends in a draw.

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:50.077
Nice and neat. Everything's accounted for,
except your old shell.

01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:52.628
Well, I think that about covers it.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:56.582
Well?

01:15:56.677 --> 01:16:00.386
Somebody has good taste in interior
decoration. Is this your safe house?

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:03.761
Yup. You know, you're the first person
to ever come here.

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:08.269
And you're welcome to stay,
as long as you like.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:13.808
Thanks, batou. But I'm going.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:22.195
Uh, will you tell me what the two of you
talked about together?

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:26.662
I mean, is he still with you?
And will he be part of you forever?

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:32.084
Batou, remember the words I spoke
in another voice on the boat that night?

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:35.504
I understand it now, and there are even
more words that go with the passage.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:39.337
These words are:
"When I was a child,

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.670
my speech, feelings and thinking
were all those of a child.

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:46.053
Now that I am a man, I have
no more use for childish ways."

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:49.761
And now I can say these things
without help in my own voice.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:53.347
Because I am now neither the woman
who was known as the major,

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:56.229
nor am I the program
called the puppet master.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:02.948
In the left pocket of my jacket
in the hallway are some car keys.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.572
Take the one you like.
The door code is 2...

01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:07.904
25017

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:11.786
that may be our private password
when we meet each other again.

01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:21.880
And where does the newborn go from here?

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.554
The net is vast and infinite.
