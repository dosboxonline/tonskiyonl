WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:04.352
Okay.
Juice and coffee all ready.

00:04.352 --> 00:05.831
- Should I take
the banana bread out?

00:05.831 --> 00:07.007
Yes, please.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.661
She left her hotel
22 minutes ago.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.359
She should be here
any minute.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.882
Don't give me that look.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.492
You're the one who
insisted on showering together.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.581
I thought it
would save time.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.496
When are you
going to learn, Shaunie?

00:18.496 --> 00:19.976
I'm irresistible.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.499
That is very true.

00:22.805 --> 00:23.936
She's here.

00:27.505 --> 00:28.767
Hi!

00:28.767 --> 00:31.596
Hello, Claire.
It is very good to see you.

00:41.824 --> 00:44.783
Would you like coffee or
freshly squeezed orange juice?

00:44.783 --> 00:45.871
Coffee, please.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.438
Oh, my God.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.136
He is the cutest.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.094
- Look at the little cheeks.
- I know.

00:51.094 --> 00:53.749
How are things at
Centro de Salud?

00:53.749 --> 00:55.011
Great.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.578
I've managed to make
a ton of improvements

00:56.578 --> 00:59.320
- since you were there.
- Did you get a new
CT machine?

00:59.320 --> 01:01.235
Yeah, and an MRI.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.193
Also, we opened
a prenatal clinic,

01:03.193 --> 01:05.326
and I've instituted
a bunch of protocols

01:05.326 --> 01:07.850
to decrease Hospital
Acquired Infections.

01:07.850 --> 01:10.026
And on
the personal front?

01:10.026 --> 01:12.681
Uh... that is
a work in progress.

01:12.681 --> 01:13.986
But good.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.206
I told Lea about
the lump in your breast.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.948
It was before I convinced you
to have your surgery here.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.602
Not a HIPAA violation.

01:20.602 --> 01:23.561
I hope you also told her
that the biopsy was negative.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.868
It's not cancer, so there's
nothing to worry about.

01:25.868 --> 01:28.218
He did. I reserve
the right to worry.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.090
But let's save
the medicine for later

01:30.090 --> 01:32.831
and focus on more important
stuff like Latin lovers.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.833
Oh. Oh, is that
banana bread?

01:34.833 --> 01:35.921
That smells amazing.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.271
Resistance is futile.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.968
- We have ways
of making you talk.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.711
That was a nice start
to the day.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.191
A fantastic start.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.195
What are you
gonna wear?

01:48.195 --> 01:50.066
I know it's just
City Hall,

01:50.066 --> 01:52.808
but it feels like we should
at least wear
something special.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.897
We can't get married
at City Hall.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.638
- Alex, we've been over this.
- I know.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.640
And you say you don't care
where we get married.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.555
I don't.
But you want to wear
something special,

02:00.555 --> 02:03.297
because you want our
wedding to be special
like I do.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.255
I don't want to delay
our adoption.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.996
You won't have to.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.129
I'm gonna give you
the wedding you deserve.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.740
Something beautiful
and impressive like you.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.177
In four days?
As impressive as me?

02:14.177 --> 02:16.397
Impossible.

02:16.397 --> 02:17.789
Challenge accepted.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.276
This is
a Thomas Keller recipe.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.060
I found it online.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.106
Wow. Smells delicious.

02:32.021 --> 02:33.240
And...

02:34.589 --> 02:36.243
your morning dose.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.767
Also delicious.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.117
When I was little, I used to
dream about being a chef

02:41.117 --> 02:43.337
at a really nice restaurant,

02:43.337 --> 02:45.426
and now I'm gonna
make it a reality.

02:48.429 --> 02:49.734
I know I'll have to
start at the bottom,

02:49.734 --> 02:51.954
but I can work my way up.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.261
Hmm. I'm glad you're
feeling better,

02:54.261 --> 02:56.088
but, you know,
you have to focus on today.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.786
I know.
I'm gonna get clean.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.615
- You're gonna get
professional treatment--
- No.

03:02.051 --> 03:04.227
It's the only way.
And it's the only way forward.

03:04.227 --> 03:07.361
No, it's not.
I don't want methadone.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.450
I hate meetings
and sharing with strangers.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.800
So we'll find you
a program that works for you,

03:11.800 --> 03:13.845
but getting sober
is the point.

03:13.845 --> 03:16.544
It's the only point.
You can't make this a solo act.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.372
I'm not alone.
I have you.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.069
I'm not an
addiction specialist.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.897
No, but you are
a neurosurgeon.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.115
- That's better.
- Hannah--

03:23.115 --> 03:24.726
You are
controlling my doses.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.728
We'll taper off
a little each day.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.297
It's not that simple.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.343
Even if you stop using,

03:33.343 --> 03:34.953
it's a Band-Aid.

03:34.953 --> 03:38.000
Eventually, you're
gonna relapse

03:38.000 --> 03:41.569
unless you get treatment,
and I think you know that.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.311
If I break the rules again,
you can kick my ass out.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.921
I don't want to
kick you out.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.228
I-I--
Nobody's kicking you out.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.446
I want to help.

03:49.446 --> 03:52.144
Well, then we can
do this together.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.234
Please,
just give me a chance.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.196
33-year-old male,
struck by lightning.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.416
Second degree burns
and a possible fractured spine.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.766
- A spinal fracture
from lightning?
- From falling off a roof.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.072
He was working construction
when he got hit.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.074
- Can't feel my legs.
- Push IV fluids.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.250
Let's get trauma labs
and an EKG.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.816
Can you tell me
your name?

04:11.816 --> 04:13.427
- Clint.
- Nice to meet you, Clint.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.733
I'm Dr. Allen. I'm gonna
take good care of you.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.953
Take the trauma shears,
cut his clothes off.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.402
Oh.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.361
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.364
Oh, it's so great
to see you.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.930
You, too. I wish it was
under better circumstances.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.106
Oh, I'll be fine.
It's just a tiny benign lump.

04:41.106 --> 04:43.065
Hi, Dr. Brown.
I'm Charlie Lukaitis.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.675
It's very nice to meet you,
Charlie.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.373
Shaun speaks
really highly of you.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.200
- Really?
- I have been fair,

04:48.200 --> 04:50.420
but not overly
complimentary.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.335
Shaun, I was being nice.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.642
You could try harder
to do the same.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.426
- Thank you, Dr. Brown.
- Oh, call me Claire.

04:56.426 --> 04:58.167
Okay, I'm sure
the new MRI

04:58.167 --> 04:59.429
you acquired
is excellent,

04:59.429 --> 05:01.083
but we should do
a stereotactic biopsy

05:01.083 --> 05:02.606
and breast MRI.

05:02.606 --> 05:03.999
Instead of a mammogram?

05:03.999 --> 05:05.827
New research shows
that breast MRI

05:05.827 --> 05:07.611
are more accurate
for younger women

05:07.611 --> 05:09.091
with denser breast tissue.

05:09.091 --> 05:12.050
I was about
to say that.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.792
Sorry, I'm working
on controlling
my impulsive speech.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.404
It just seems you're eager
to demonstrate your knowledge

05:17.404 --> 05:19.623
as med students
are supposed to do.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.973
Thank you, Dr. Brown.
I mean, Claire.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.193
Now you are
being too nice.

05:26.108 --> 05:29.329
Those are punctate burns
at the entry and exit points

05:29.329 --> 05:31.592
connected by second degree
linear flash burn.

05:31.592 --> 05:34.334
What are all these
red lines?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.466
- I'm not s--
- Lichtenberg figures.

05:36.466 --> 05:39.121
The electric shock
causes extravasation
of red blood cells

05:39.121 --> 05:41.036
from the capillaries.

05:41.036 --> 05:43.081
It'll heal with
minimal scarring.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.822
Hi. I'm Dr. Lim.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.389
I thought Dr. Park
was on today.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.652
He's taking a personal day--
wedding planning.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.003
Can you
wiggle your toes?

05:52.003 --> 05:53.222
Alright, nice.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.180
The loss of sensation
in your legs

05:55.180 --> 05:56.443
is a temporary
keraunoparalysis.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.575
It'll disappear
over the next few hours.

05:58.575 --> 06:02.100
Get spinal CTs
and trauma pan scan to confirm,

06:02.100 --> 06:03.363
then we'll
debride the burns.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.934
- Are you ready
to take Mama to work?

06:09.934 --> 06:11.632
Yeah?

06:22.556 --> 06:23.992
Hello?

06:23.992 --> 06:25.646
Glassy, you home?

06:28.997 --> 06:30.128
Oh, my God.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.174
I am so sorry.
That's my fault.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.567
I was seasoning
the skillet,

06:33.567 --> 06:35.177
and I left for like a second
to take out the trash.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.266
I'm Lea,
Aaron's neighbor.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.659
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Hannah.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.964
I'm Aaron's niece.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.401
I'm just visiting
for a couple weeks.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.620
I'm so sorry
if I woke you guys up.

06:43.620 --> 06:46.101
Oh, it's alright. I w--
I was just heading to work.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.451
I should, um,
open a window.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.806
So, you'll have to lie
facedown

06:55.806 --> 06:58.069
- with your breast
centered in the frame.
- Okay.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.333
Is it harder or easier

07:01.333 --> 07:03.727
this time being
a second-year?

07:03.727 --> 07:05.903
Um... bit of both.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.863
Yeah.
What about you, Chief?

07:08.863 --> 07:10.081
How are you liking
the big chair?

07:10.081 --> 07:11.909
I like it.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.476
Fewer resources than here,

07:13.476 --> 07:16.044
but also fewer restrictions
and more control.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.698
Mm.
Sounds like a good fit.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.874
Hmm. Oh, speaking of.

07:19.874 --> 07:22.180
Shaun showed me your
Lamborghini in the parking lot.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.095
I know. I know.
I'm an idiot.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.793
No, I was gonna say
good for you.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.316
I thought you
hated sports cars.

07:27.316 --> 07:30.841
Oh, I mean, I still do,
but I know that you loved them.

07:30.841 --> 07:34.062
And you just didn't
want to seem ostentatious.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.367
Mm.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.718
No, I'm happy you've
stopped worrying so much

07:37.718 --> 07:40.068
about what
other people think.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.461
Whatever you left
here searching for,

07:41.461 --> 07:42.984
it's clear you found it.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.161
Maybe we both did.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.295
We're looking for
white-speculated

07:50.295 --> 07:53.298
enhancing masses like...
there.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.693
1.72 centimeters.

07:56.693 --> 07:57.955
A 3-centimeter incision
should--

07:57.955 --> 07:59.783
Did you and Claire
used to date?

07:59.783 --> 08:02.699
W-We were just good friends.

08:02.699 --> 08:03.918
With benefits.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.181
I knew it.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.836
Does Jordan know
that she's here?

08:10.011 --> 08:11.578
Uh, I don't know.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.276
Also, that hardly matters
since I'm not dating Jordan.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.626
Oh? I thought
you wanted to.

08:16.626 --> 08:19.455
- I did.

08:19.455 --> 08:22.240
But we decided
to just be good friends.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.764
Her and Perez,
her ex-boyfriend,

08:23.764 --> 08:25.243
text every day
since Asher died.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.984
It was wrong.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.377
No, it's not wrong.
It's just a choice.

08:28.377 --> 08:31.336
The biopsy from Guatemala
was negative,

08:31.336 --> 08:34.644
but our biopsy from earlier
came back positive.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.428
Claire has breast cancer.

08:42.217 --> 08:45.046
- Sorry I didn't
come by earlier.
- Hi!

08:45.046 --> 08:47.091
Park is out,
and I had to help Glassman

08:47.091 --> 08:48.702
get some stuff
off his plate.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.834
- It's still not
an excuse.
- It's fine.

08:50.834 --> 08:54.272
I'm here now to assure you
you are going to be fine.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.970
Shaun briefed me
on your biopsy,

08:55.970 --> 08:57.406
and we went over
your MRI together.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.973
You are in
the perfect hands.

09:00.496 --> 09:03.151
Ooh. Tell me about being
co-president with Glassman.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.893
Mm.
It's been interesting.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.198
Collaborative.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.070
By collaborative,
you mean you get stuff done,

09:09.070 --> 09:10.985
and then he tells you how
you should have gotten it done?

09:10.985 --> 09:12.552
Oh, you have one of those
in Guatemala?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.380
- Just one? I wish.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.774
- Oh, I miss the old days.
- Mm.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.863
You mean when you were
a Ducati-riding badass?

09:19.863 --> 09:22.039
Hey, I do not need
a Ducati to be a badass.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.258
- Mm.
- I just need...

09:23.258 --> 09:25.347
- More sleep?
- I was thinking
more sex,

09:25.347 --> 09:27.131
but sleep is good.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.481
- Tell me about it.
Sometimes I wonder if I--

09:29.481 --> 09:31.179
Hold that thought.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.661
- To be continued.
- I'll be here.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.016
Hey, we need to talk.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.975
Hello, I need to get Claire
prepped for her surgery.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.238
There's a girl living
in Glassman's apartment.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.806
She says her name is Hannah
and claims she's his niece.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.808
He does not have a niece
named Hannah.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.636
I know, but she had a key
and her clothes were there.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.856
He had a patient
last week named Hannah.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.205
She was a homeless
drug addict

09:57.205 --> 09:58.859
who needed
cervicomedullary surgery.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.600
Why would he let a homeless
drug addict live with him?

10:02.036 --> 10:03.820
I...

10:03.820 --> 10:05.909
don't know.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.955
- I have to go.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.917
The MRI confirmed the mass
is under 2 centimeters.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.877
That's only Stage 1A.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.096
With your hormone profile,
you should be responsive

10:19.096 --> 10:20.881
to hormone therapy
after the surgery.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.534
You probably won't need chemo.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.975
Do you disagree?

10:27.975 --> 10:29.150
No.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.238
Tell me if you do.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.587
I'd rather get
the bad news now.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.633
I agree completely.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.504
I was just thinking
about someone else.

10:37.811 --> 10:41.423
But I will be focused
in the OR.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.169
Another 10 milligrams
morphine.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.300
Sorry.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.432
I just need to remove

10:50.432 --> 10:52.129
the necrotic skin
and tissue

10:52.129 --> 10:53.478
to avoid infection.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.871
That's okay.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.786
It hurts
'cause I'm alive.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.658
Never taking that
for granted again.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.224
Good for you.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.052
I never should have even
started working construction.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.403
Take a couple
deep breaths.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.798
Maybe just not outside
during a thunderstorm.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.932
I used to have a band.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.629
Even put out
a couple EPs,

11:13.629 --> 11:16.240
but we just
couldn't break out.

11:17.241 --> 11:20.201
I got a day job,
turned 30.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.246
Next thing I know,

11:22.246 --> 11:25.597
I'm a foreman
for a roofing company.

11:25.597 --> 11:29.210
Sometimes, big decisions are
just a bunch of small ones

11:29.210 --> 11:30.907
you don't even realize
you made.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.954
I just feel
like I should recommit.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.129
You know, I could
eke out a living

11:35.129 --> 11:37.784
playing clubs and bars.

11:37.784 --> 11:41.091
I'd rather look in the mirror
and know...

11:41.091 --> 11:42.702
I'm the person I want to be.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.012
A curvilinear incision

11:49.012 --> 11:50.971
along the natural crease line
of the breast

11:50.971 --> 11:53.538
gives the best cosmetic
result.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.715
Who were you
thinking about?

11:55.715 --> 11:58.108
You told Claire you were
thinking about someone else.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.763
I shouldn't talk about it.

12:00.763 --> 12:05.376
Raising the flap with
a wide margin around the mass.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.987
Did I say something
inappropriate?

12:06.987 --> 12:09.990
I wasn't thinking about you.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.426
- Was it--
- Charlie.

12:11.426 --> 12:12.819
He said he doesn't want
to talk about it.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.347
Send this to pathology.

12:19.347 --> 12:22.393
The tissue orientation
is marked with ink at 12:00.

12:22.393 --> 12:25.962
Dr. Kalu, your suture spacing
is quite excellent.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.181
You can close.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.139
Suture with vicryls
and monocryl, please.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.283
Is the Hannah
who's living with you

12:42.283 --> 12:45.112
the same Hannah
you treated for Chiari Zero?

12:45.112 --> 12:46.200
Yes.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.813
Seven ball,
corner pocket.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.250
Sh-She is
a drug addict.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.078
Who I am helping.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.340
Helping her detox?

12:56.340 --> 12:58.081
She's a patient
under my care, Shaun.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.300
That's all you need
to know.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.693
If she's a patient,

13:01.693 --> 13:04.435
that means you are
continuing to treat her

13:04.435 --> 13:06.002
while she is
living with you.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.395
- How?
- Shaun--

13:07.395 --> 13:09.092
Are you prescribing her
opiates?

13:09.092 --> 13:11.312
I'm helping her get sober.

13:11.312 --> 13:14.141
I can't have her go out
on the street and buy drugs.

13:14.141 --> 13:17.884
Prescribing her oxycodone
in this situation is unethical.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.711
- I'm aware.
- And possibly illegal.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.844
- I'm aware.
- You could lose
your medical license.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.324
You need to make her leave.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.986
I'm not giving up on her.
But thank you for your concern.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.948
How long
has he been seizing?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.428
Over four minutes.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.473
- Then give four milligrams
lorazepam.
- Already did.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.606
Then give four more
and one gram levetiracetam.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.049
He's got a mass
in his frontal lobe.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.312
- Could it be
from the lightning strike?
- No.

13:55.312 --> 13:58.446
In fact, the lightning
probably saved his life,
putting him in the hospital.

13:58.446 --> 14:02.189
He has that seizure anywhere
else, he'd probably be dead.

14:02.189 --> 14:04.104
A supramaximal resection
might get at all.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.628
- If we're lucky.
- And if we're not?

14:06.628 --> 14:09.413
It'll likely progress
to a glioblastoma and kill him.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.201
We had our first
official date here.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.506
She jumped on stage

14:15.506 --> 14:17.160
and tried to join Cory Henry's
backup singers.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.335
She loves music,

14:18.335 --> 14:20.076
and this would be
the perfect place.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.861
Yeah,
I'd love to help you,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.558
but I got bands booked
every night.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.690
Couldn't you
reschedule one?

14:25.690 --> 14:27.692
I-I'll pay their fee,
cover whatever the difference
ends up being in your gate.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.303
I mean, name your price.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.870
Sorry.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.045
But I think you're gonna
have to choose

14:32.045 --> 14:34.961
between immediate
and meaningful.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.880
The glioma is
in your posterior frontal lobe

14:40.880 --> 14:42.011
near the motor strip.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.621
We have to be
very aggressive.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.449
If we leave
any tumor behind,

14:45.449 --> 14:47.190
it could grow back
as a glioblastoma,

14:47.190 --> 14:49.976
which could be terminal.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.238
Okay.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.066
Because of the placement
of the tumor,

14:53.066 --> 14:55.503
we may need to cut
into your eloquent cortex,

14:55.503 --> 14:58.158
the area of your brain
which controls motor function.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.248
Are you saying
I won't be able to play guitar?

15:02.075 --> 15:03.511
It's possible.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.996
Alive is alive.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.085
I'll take it.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.872
I am going to tell
Dr. Lim

15:16.872 --> 15:18.961
about Dr. Glassman
and Hannah.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.094
I don't think
that's a good idea.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.531
He'd probably consider it
an even worse betrayal

15:23.531 --> 15:25.098
than when you ended
his surgical career.

15:25.098 --> 15:27.317
I was right about that,

15:27.317 --> 15:29.450
and I am right
about this, too.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.932
He could lose
his medical license.
I am saving him.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.978
Shaun, I don't think it's just
about helping a former patient.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.981
What else is it about?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.896
You know why he helped
you back in Wyoming?

15:40.896 --> 15:42.637
Because he knew
I needed help.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.856
Of course.

15:44.856 --> 15:49.339
Also...
his daughter had just died.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.167
He was grieving.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.604
Maybe he did for you
what he couldn't do for her.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.347
What does that
have to do with Hannah?

15:57.347 --> 16:00.263
Hannah's a drug addict,
just like Maddie was.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.483
I think some of this is
Glassman dealing with his sense

16:02.483 --> 16:04.485
that he failed his daughter.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.618
After everything
he's done to support you,

16:07.618 --> 16:10.317
don't you think you should
let him help Hannah?

16:13.711 --> 16:19.021
Dr. Glassman... is only putting
himself at risk,

16:19.021 --> 16:20.718
which I guess is okay.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.767
I won't tell Dr. Lim.

16:26.507 --> 16:27.508
Okay.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.175
I'm thinking
an awake craniotomy

16:42.175 --> 16:44.394
with intraoperative
motor brain mapping.

16:44.394 --> 16:47.832
Respiratory failure leads
to brain edema and herniation,

16:47.832 --> 16:50.226
air embolism,
intraop seizures,

16:50.226 --> 16:52.881
just to name
a few of the risks.

16:52.881 --> 16:57.625
He was struck by lightning
and remembered who he was.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.061
A guitarist.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.976
I don't want to take
that away from him.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.978
Big swing.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.414
I think I'm gonna do it.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.068
You seem
amped up about this.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.766
It suits you.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.380
You need to keep him playing
guitar during the surgery.

17:13.380 --> 17:16.339
If his playing gets worse
during motor mapping,

17:16.339 --> 17:18.080
then you can't cut
into that area.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.864
If he keeps playing well,
then it's safe to cut.

17:23.694 --> 17:28.003
<i>Digale a Dr. Maldonado
que cubra esos turnos...</i>

17:28.003 --> 17:31.398
<i>Esperemos la semana que viene.</i>

17:31.398 --> 17:33.835
<i>Me tengo que ir.</i>

17:33.835 --> 17:35.576
<i>Gracias, Imelda.</i>

17:37.969 --> 17:40.581
Your pathology
just came back.

17:40.581 --> 17:41.886
We didn't get
clean margins.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.021
Now, you're already
on the board
for this afternoon.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.328
We'll perform a re-excision,
removing a wider margin

17:48.328 --> 17:49.720
of the breast tissue,

17:49.720 --> 17:51.331
followed by a sentinel
lymph node biopsy

17:51.331 --> 17:52.984
to see if it's spread.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.031
But...

17:58.555 --> 18:00.035
...if it has...

18:01.341 --> 18:03.517
...well, then, who better
to take this on?

18:05.519 --> 18:07.042
You grew up
in a trailer park.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.305
You were raised
by a bipolar mother.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.220
Went to a top med school
on scholarship.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.527
Then you were recruited to be
chief of surgery in a country

18:13.527 --> 18:16.007
where you didn't even know
the language.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.184
Now, two years later,
you, uh...

18:18.184 --> 18:20.751
you speak perfect Spanish
and you've overhauled
the hospital.

18:23.406 --> 18:26.148
You are an unstoppable force,
Claire Browne.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.977
And on top of all of that,

18:28.977 --> 18:31.675
you are kind,
compassionate,

18:31.675 --> 18:34.896
and [chuckles] heart-stoppingly
beautiful.

18:39.161 --> 18:43.034
Cancer doesn't stand
a chance against you.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.738
Forgot how great
your bedside manner is.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.700
And my Spanish
is far from perfect.

19:03.881 --> 19:06.014
Play guitar during surgery?

19:06.014 --> 19:08.059
The risk of complications
is higher,

19:08.059 --> 19:10.192
but an awake surgery
is the only way

19:10.192 --> 19:13.761
to ensure full post-op function
of your fine motor skills.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.763
We test each resection area

19:15.763 --> 19:19.767
and get immediate feedback
before removing any tissue.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.421
And won't it hurt?

19:21.421 --> 19:23.249
You won't even feel it.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.211
Any song requests?

19:31.082 --> 19:33.259
Thank you for coming.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.130
So, what does she want?

19:35.130 --> 19:37.350
She doesn't want anything.
She doesn't know I'm here.

19:37.350 --> 19:41.832
I want your help.
I'd like to stage
an intervention for Hannah.

19:41.832 --> 19:44.879
You think we haven't
tried that-- multiple times?

19:44.879 --> 19:46.924
Well, let's try again.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.099
Your daughter needs
your help.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.231
What do you know
about my daughter?

19:51.146 --> 19:53.583
She came to me
with Chiari Zero.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.629
That is a malformation
of the brain

19:55.629 --> 19:59.502
which causes persistent
and sometimes
very intense pain.

19:59.502 --> 20:02.288
That's why she started
on the oxycodone.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.811
Can that be treated?

20:03.811 --> 20:05.639
My colleague already
performed surgery.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.206
It was
a complete success.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.339
She had brain surgery?

20:11.427 --> 20:12.820
Is she still
in the hospital?

20:14.822 --> 20:17.520
She's staying on my couch.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.305
It was there
or the streets.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.351
So she's using
in your home?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.227
Yes,
under my supervision.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.272
I wrote her a prescription
for oxycodone,

20:30.272 --> 20:32.318
which I'm administering
on a schedule.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.102
You're her new
drug dealer.

20:34.102 --> 20:37.061
Her first night
in my apartment,
she OD'd on fentanyl--

20:37.061 --> 20:38.672
fentanyl that she bought
on the street.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.588
Street drugs right now
are Russian roulette.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.372
What I'm doing
is much safer.

20:43.372 --> 20:46.332
I could call the cops on you.
Do you know that?

20:46.332 --> 20:48.682
Tell me something--
is it just the drugs?

20:48.682 --> 20:50.118
Are you also sleeping
with her?

20:50.118 --> 20:51.989
If I were doing that,
would I be calling you?

20:51.989 --> 20:55.036
Can we please stop
with the nonsense now?

20:55.036 --> 20:56.516
I'm trying
to save her life.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.908
The only way
she turns this around

20:57.908 --> 20:59.693
is if she hits rock bottom.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.782
- Rock bottom.
- Mm-hmm.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.787
I kicked my daughter
out of my house.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.615
And I told her,
"Do not come back

21:08.615 --> 21:11.487
until you're clean
and sober."

21:11.487 --> 21:14.969
The next time I saw her was
on the coroner's table.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.626
Well, I'm very sorry.

21:21.889 --> 21:25.719
But Hannah
is not your daughter.

21:25.719 --> 21:29.592
And the only person
that can save Hannah is Hannah.

21:29.592 --> 21:32.421
But she has
to want the help.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.249
And that's never
gonna happen

21:34.249 --> 21:35.859
as long as you keep
enabling her.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.225
I heard your second surgery
was boring--

21:54.225 --> 21:55.488
just the way
we like them.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.228
I'm still a little sore.

21:57.228 --> 21:58.708
That's why I brought this.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.449
Oh, thank you.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.931
Oh, yeah,
that is much better.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.802
Bless you.

22:05.802 --> 22:08.065
Now, show me that baby.

22:11.591 --> 22:14.550
Oh, she is gorgeous.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.422
The spitting image
of Winston Churchill.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.772
- She, too, will one day
rule an empire.

22:18.772 --> 22:21.818
Park looks so happy
to be her dad.
Doesn't he?

22:21.818 --> 22:23.211
And as soon
as we get married,

22:23.211 --> 22:24.995
we can finalize the adoption
and make it official.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.867
Way to bury the lede!
Congrats.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.172
When's the big day?

22:28.172 --> 22:29.739
Sometime this week, actually.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.351
- Do you want to come?
- Absolutely.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.614
Oh, I'm just glad
that Park is making

22:34.614 --> 22:35.876
an honest woman
out of you.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.443
Me, too.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.619
I can't believe
how close I came
to letting him get away.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.235
Hi.
- Hi.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.761
I'm making Coq au vin.

22:51.761 --> 22:54.721
I found a bottle of Burgundy
in the cabinet.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.636
I hope you don't mind.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.072
We're celebrating.

22:58.072 --> 22:59.682
Celebrating?

23:00.422 --> 23:01.597
What are we celebrating?

23:02.642 --> 23:03.991
I got a job...

23:05.122 --> 23:07.690
at L'Amour,
as a hostess,

23:07.690 --> 23:10.171
but it's one of the best
restaurants in the city,

23:10.171 --> 23:12.521
and I can
work my way up.

23:12.521 --> 23:15.524
Wow.
That is amazing.

23:15.524 --> 23:18.135
I am very,
very proud of you.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.137
Thank you.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.052
I'm proud of me, too.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.837
- Mmm.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.796
Oh.
Time for your pill.

23:26.796 --> 23:29.016
Um, after my shower.

23:29.016 --> 23:32.846
This has to simmer
for 30 minutes, anyway.

24:25.376 --> 24:28.205
- Those aren't mine.
- Please don't lie to me.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.859
I found them
in your jeans.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.513
Why were you going through
my stuff?

24:31.513 --> 24:33.907
Well, obviously,
I can't trust you, can I?

24:35.343 --> 24:37.476
I want to get clean.
I do. I just...

24:38.346 --> 24:40.261
You're making me go
too fast.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.523
We're gonna get
you treatment.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.351
I'm gonna take you,
and we're gonna go, and--

24:43.351 --> 24:45.396
No, I told you,
I'm not going to rehab.

24:45.396 --> 24:46.876
It doesn't work!

24:46.876 --> 24:49.444
- It's the only thing
that does work!
- I'm outta here.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.446
- I'm gonna flush it
right down the toilet.
- Stop. What are you doing?

24:51.446 --> 24:52.665
That's mine. Stop it.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.667
- I paid for those.
Stop it.
- Too bad.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.103
- There you go.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.278
Okay?

25:02.588 --> 25:04.415
This is your fault!

25:04.415 --> 25:06.809
How could you think
giving me more pills

25:06.809 --> 25:08.332
was gonna help me
get clean?!

25:08.332 --> 25:09.551
How is it my fault?

25:09.551 --> 25:10.944
I'm giving you
too many drugs

25:10.944 --> 25:12.685
or I'm making you
kick too fast--

25:12.685 --> 25:14.121
Which is it?
It can't be both.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.557
I hate you!

25:15.557 --> 25:17.211
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do!

25:17.211 --> 25:19.605
I hate you.
I got to go.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.216
You can't leave.
Like hell, I can't.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.827
If you leave, you're g--
you're gonna end up dead.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.002
Is that what you want?

25:27.047 --> 25:28.483
This isn't working.

25:30.572 --> 25:33.096
- I have to go.
- Okay. Alright. Alright.
Alright, alright.

25:57.468 --> 26:00.689
Your pathology report
hasn't come back yet.

26:00.689 --> 26:03.779
Oh, that wasn't why I, um--
why I texted.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.827
What's been on your mind?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.354
You're not very good
at keeping secrets, Shaun.

26:14.355 --> 26:18.228
I... can't tell you.

26:19.534 --> 26:21.884
Do you want to?
Yes, I think you could help.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.932
I've never betrayed
your trust.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.805
Dr. Glassman
is prescribing oxycodone

26:29.805 --> 26:32.025
to a teenage drug addict
who is living with him.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.070
He says he isn't
concerned about losing
his medical license

26:34.070 --> 26:36.029
or going to jail,
but he should be.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.596
If I don't understand
his decisions,

26:37.596 --> 26:39.946
how can I stop him
from making bad ones?

26:40.729 --> 26:43.036
Oh.

26:46.561 --> 26:49.390
When I was a kid, I...

26:49.390 --> 26:52.611
I didn't even ask
why my mom used.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.700
I was too busy
trying to survive.

26:54.700 --> 27:00.880
But now, I think
what my mom needed most

27:00.880 --> 27:05.624
was one thing in her life
without an "if" attached.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.148
With addicts,
everything becomes conditional.

27:08.148 --> 27:11.151
A home, a job, even love.

27:11.151 --> 27:15.329
They only get them
if they get clean.

27:15.329 --> 27:19.333
Dr. Glassman told Maddie
she could only come home

27:19.333 --> 27:20.726
if she got sober.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.032
Then she died.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.033
The "if" killed her.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.689
The drugs killed her.

27:27.689 --> 27:31.519
And a car accident killed
my mom, but...

27:34.435 --> 27:37.873
...sometimes I can't help
but feel

27:37.873 --> 27:40.702
if I'd told her
I loved her unconditionally...

27:41.834 --> 27:43.183
she would still be alive.

27:47.013 --> 27:53.236
So, Dr. Glassman
needs to keep giving Hannah

27:53.236 --> 27:56.979
unconditional love,
even if it risks his career?

27:56.979 --> 27:58.633
I think so.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.331
And if I want to help
Dr. Glassman,

28:01.331 --> 28:03.420
I need to help Hannah.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.122
How?

28:09.122 --> 28:11.167
I-I'm sorry, Shaun.
I don't know.

28:13.169 --> 28:17.957
But if someone told me
the day we met outside,

28:17.957 --> 28:19.698
when you were soaking wet,

28:19.698 --> 28:22.048
barely able to communicate,

28:22.048 --> 28:24.050
that you would become
a top attending,

28:24.050 --> 28:26.574
a wonderful husband
and father,

28:26.574 --> 28:28.271
I wouldn't have
believed them.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.361
But you have grown
so much.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.323
You're really, really good
at helping people, Shaun.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.370
You're gonna figure out
how to help.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.593
I've missed this.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.292
Me, too.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.168
Ojemann stimulator.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.041
Beginning motor mapping.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.614
No motor arrest.

29:06.614 --> 29:09.051
Mark area one
safe for resection.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.934
Area two
not safe for resection.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.201
Are you okay, Clint?

29:28.201 --> 29:29.376
I think so.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.204
Can you keep playing?

29:37.036 --> 29:38.559
Continuing motor mapping.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.128
Totally clean margins,
lymph node negative,

29:42.128 --> 29:43.346
no more surgeries.

29:43.346 --> 29:45.435
You are good to go.

29:45.435 --> 29:48.525
Oh, that is fantastic.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.701
Oh, thank you.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.013
I'm so glad
I got to see you again.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.450
Me, too.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.801
Seems like you're back
where you belong.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.940
I wasn't gonna come back.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.116
I, um...

30:14.116 --> 30:15.378
I-I told Shaun

30:15.378 --> 30:17.511
that I'd just get
the lumpectomy in Guatemala,

30:17.511 --> 30:21.080
and then he told me
that you would be here.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.218
You know,
since being back,

30:29.218 --> 30:33.962
I, um, think about you
all the time.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.008
Not like I didn't before,
but...

30:36.008 --> 30:37.618
I don't know why
I couldn't commit to you.

30:38.662 --> 30:42.971
I think I was just young, stubborn.

30:43.580 --> 30:44.581
It's okay.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.416
We got all of it.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.375
You'll need to do
some radiotherapy,

30:55.375 --> 30:58.726
but it shouldn't interfere
with your music career.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.337
Well, I'm not sure
any crowd will compare

31:01.337 --> 31:03.818
to playing
with my brain exposed.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.603
Thank you so much.

31:17.005 --> 31:21.096
You look upset,
like you have been crying.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.576
Are you okay?

31:23.969 --> 31:25.274
No.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.191
Hannah bought pills
on the street.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.892
I don't know what to do.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.483
I can't help her.
I tried.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.969
I-I don't want to...

32:10.015 --> 32:12.756
I don't want
to fight anymore.

32:24.768 --> 32:27.293
Do you want me
to stay with you?

32:34.430 --> 32:36.128
No.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.269
I'm gonna go
for a walk.

32:47.269 --> 32:49.184
Thank you.
Thank you.

33:04.286 --> 33:06.723
Who are you?

33:06.723 --> 33:09.422
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

33:10.553 --> 33:14.035
Dr. Glassman's... son.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.689
Not biologically.

33:18.170 --> 33:21.521
Dr. Glassman helped me
like he's helping you.

33:21.521 --> 33:25.438
So, basically,
we're both broken toys

33:25.438 --> 33:28.441
that are supposed to replace
the daughter he couldn't fix?

33:28.441 --> 33:32.271
Dr. Glassman
didn't fix me.

33:34.186 --> 33:35.622
He loved me.

33:40.844 --> 33:43.195
I'm not like
other people.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.678
Other kids
called me weird.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.204
My parents
didn't want me.

33:53.640 --> 33:57.035
So, that was how
I saw myself.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.734
But Dr. Glassman saw
that I could be more.

34:00.734 --> 34:03.519
And now I see myself
as so much more

34:03.519 --> 34:06.087
because Dr. Glassman
loved me...

34:07.784 --> 34:09.264
...unconditionally.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.703
I am still different.

34:13.703 --> 34:18.012
I will...
always have autism,

34:18.012 --> 34:20.014
but now
I'm proud of that.

34:22.016 --> 34:23.583
You will always be
an addict,

34:23.583 --> 34:25.280
even if you stop
using drugs.

34:27.326 --> 34:30.851
But Dr. Glassman sees
you can be more.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.029
Why can't you?

34:47.346 --> 34:49.522
Mm.
It's after midnight.

34:49.522 --> 34:50.871
I know.

34:50.871 --> 34:52.742
Joelle's on her way
to babysit.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.222
Why?

34:54.222 --> 34:56.268
I borrowed your
favorite dress,

34:56.268 --> 34:58.922
gave it to the dressmaker,
so she'd have the right size.

34:58.922 --> 35:00.489
I haven't looked.

35:00.489 --> 35:03.536
I'm not supposed
to see it until later.

35:03.536 --> 35:06.321
We're getting married now?

35:06.321 --> 35:09.281
2:00 a.m. was the only time
the perfect venue
was available.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.152
Idle Time Jazz Bar,
where we--

35:11.152 --> 35:12.893
Had our first
official date.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.330
You're amazing.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.042
I'm glad you're here.

35:34.044 --> 35:37.613
I know I'll always be
an addict.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.575
But I'd like to be more.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.319
I know I need rehab.

35:48.929 --> 35:51.061
I'd really like it...

35:51.061 --> 35:53.281
if you could still
be here for me...

35:54.848 --> 35:56.284
...after rehab.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.376
Like you were
for Dr. Murphy.

36:15.434 --> 36:19.351
As long as I'm here,
I'll be here for you.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.182
We have to find you
the right program.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.227
I am a president
of a hospital,

36:26.227 --> 36:29.099
so I should be able to pull
some strings.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.799
Mr. Big Shot.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.192
You better believe it.

36:39.066 --> 36:42.156
To always support
your boundless ambitions.

36:42.156 --> 36:44.289
To never complain,

36:44.289 --> 36:45.899
no matter how many times
you make me listen

36:45.899 --> 36:48.031
to the same show tunes.

36:48.031 --> 36:50.208
And most of all, I...

36:51.731 --> 36:54.777
I vow to be the man
and the father

36:54.777 --> 36:57.954
and the best friend
you and Eden need.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.608
Always.

37:05.266 --> 37:08.400
Well, I think I was
the last person

37:08.400 --> 37:10.097
that knew we were
getting married tonight,

37:10.097 --> 37:12.404
so I didn't write
any vows.

37:12.404 --> 37:17.235
But the truth is
that I will never be

37:17.235 --> 37:20.890
as romantic or as sweet
as you are.

37:22.022 --> 37:25.155
But I will never stop
loving you.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.375
Or stop teasing you
because I know it turns you on.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.250
Shaun and Lea, the rings.

37:38.517 --> 37:39.822
With this ring...

37:42.042 --> 37:43.217
...I thee wed.

37:48.135 --> 37:50.529
With this ring,
I thee wed.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.141

40:21.375 --> 40:22.898
Thank you.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.293
You're welcome.

40:27.468 --> 40:30.819
You have grown...
a lot.

40:32.168 --> 40:34.997
As a doctor, as a father,
as a man.

40:36.651 --> 40:39.088
Thank you.
I have.

40:50.926 --> 40:52.841
My cancer is back.

It's progressed
to a glioblastoma.

41:01.807 --> 41:04.679
There are...
new experimental--

41:04.679 --> 41:06.507
No, no, no, no,
no, no.

41:08.204 --> 41:09.902
It's terminal.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.169
I'm dying.

Amir will be here
in a minute

41:39.584 --> 41:41.977
to take you
to your hotel.

41:41.977 --> 41:44.980
Or we could go back
to your place.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.895
I can't.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.723
Not if it's gonna be
a one-night stand.

41:50.072 --> 41:51.726
It's not gonna be
a one-night stand.

41:56.775 --> 41:58.733
Oh.

41:58.733 --> 42:00.822
You okay?

42:00.822 --> 42:03.085
Oh, yeah.
I just feel a little bit sick.

42:03.085 --> 42:04.217
Yeah, you feel warm.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.697
You didn't drink anything,
did you?

42:06.785 --> 42:09.048
No,
because of the medication.

42:09.048 --> 42:10.702
Claire?

42:11.616 --> 42:12.878
Claire? Clai--

42:16.446 --> 42:17.709
Hi. Are you Jared?

42:23.105 --> 42:25.020
St. Bonaventure,
as fast as you can drive.
