01:02.020 --> 01:06.024
THE GLORY

01:10.612 --> 01:11.946
Did you always know

01:14.365 --> 01:15.492
that I was going to...

01:17.911 --> 01:19.245
come to you for help?

01:27.295 --> 01:28.129
Yeah.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.593
So for how long?

01:35.470 --> 01:39.057
When did you know
So-hee and I knew each other?

01:41.142 --> 01:43.853
I'd known for a while
that her body was in the freezer.

01:46.231 --> 01:50.318
I saw your student ID that day
when I wrote your prescription.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.529
You were the same age as her.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.198
I assumed you had been friends.

01:56.866 --> 02:01.287
So when you bolted out of the ER,
I decided to follow you.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.250
Press on this for about five minutes.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.523
SEOUL JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL

03:14.736 --> 03:15.737
Ah!

03:15.737 --> 03:16.821
I'm sorry.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.033
<i>From the beginning,
I knew my role.</i>

03:21.659 --> 03:23.411
<i>The hospital director's son.</i>

03:26.080 --> 03:27.332
So when I heard your story,

03:27.332 --> 03:30.919
I knew I was the perfect person
to be your executioner.

03:33.129 --> 03:37.091
I wanted so badly to be of use to you.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.846
I knew I wanted to help you,
no matter what day or time.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.474
Wherever you were.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.311
I wanted to run to you
before you felt guilty for using me.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.441
But you left before I could.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.988
Thank you so much for helping me.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.199
You're going to be a great doctor.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.493
Am I not seeing you again?

04:04.369 --> 04:05.203
Wait, why?

04:06.454 --> 04:07.288
Back then,

04:08.915 --> 04:09.999
why did you leave me?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.795
You should've used me
if that's why you were there.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.672
It would've been okay.

04:16.172 --> 04:20.426
Even now I can't figure out
why you decided to give up and just leave.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.429
Tell me, why'd you do that?

04:27.392 --> 04:31.396
So-hee's mother told me
what happened to your father.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.732
When she said he had been murdered,

04:37.151 --> 04:40.571
I was afraid So-hee's body
would be removed from the freezer.

04:42.907 --> 04:43.741
But then,

04:45.493 --> 04:47.620
the intern who treated me at the hospital

04:48.121 --> 04:49.831
happened to be the director's son.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.837
I thought I found a way
to salvage my plan.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.340
So I came to find you.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.761
But then I realized something.

05:05.680 --> 05:10.268
That I was selfish, thinking
I'm the only victim that mattered.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.899
When you were a victim too.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.074
That's a relief.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.664
Here I was thinking you left
because I wasn't your type.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.462
So then...

05:40.381 --> 05:42.800
there is no reason for you not to use me.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.096
If you leave me again,

05:50.641 --> 05:51.893
then it's for love.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.480
Not for revenge.

06:10.078 --> 06:10.912
Then...

06:14.082 --> 06:14.957
help me until...

06:16.959 --> 06:17.960
the end.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.009
I'll serve you

06:26.761 --> 06:27.762
till the end.

06:29.097 --> 06:34.936
THE GLORY

06:55.289 --> 06:57.708
You've gotten so quiet without your voice.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.837
Guess it's hard to laugh at others'
misfortunes in your current state.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.964
YOU FUCKING BITCH!

07:03.714 --> 07:08.052
By the way, that scar will always itch,
always sting, and always burn.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.054
Like mine did.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.319
Do you know why I'm doing this to you?

07:26.571 --> 07:29.991
After 18 years, you all forgot about me.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.494
That's why I'm doing this.
So you'll remember.

07:34.245 --> 07:38.666
I know there's someone you want
to be remembered by too, isn't there?

07:41.294 --> 07:43.671
I've taken care of Yeon-jin. Sa-ra too.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.340
I couldn't have done it without you.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.342
And my schedule's opened up.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.846
If you want to get revenge, I'll help you.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.142
Don't you want to get back at Jae-jun?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.340
YOU WERE INSIDE?

08:31.385 --> 08:33.513
I CAME TO GET MY THINGS

08:34.847 --> 08:35.932
Yeah, I was inside.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.976
Take whatever's yours.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.580
<i>Jae-jun suffers from glaucoma.</i>

09:00.164 --> 09:03.000
Every day, he has to use Betaxolol drops.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.670
You know how someone
could accidentally get

09:06.170 --> 09:08.005
something like washer fluid

09:08.005 --> 09:10.049
or hand sanitizer in their eyes.

09:10.716 --> 09:14.053
What's important is, Jae-jun won't see

09:14.804 --> 09:17.473
his redheaded models,
those racing flag girls,

09:17.473 --> 09:18.558
even Yeon-jin,

09:19.600 --> 09:21.018
with his eyes ever again.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.025
What do you say, Hye-jeong?

09:28.985 --> 09:29.902
Do you want this?

09:40.121 --> 09:42.540
FOR REDUCING INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE

09:46.252 --> 09:47.169
Gonna take long?

09:49.505 --> 09:51.048
I need to shower before I go.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.969
Oh shit, that's right. I forgot.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.971
Can't talk, can you?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.139
Why don't you clap?

09:58.806 --> 10:01.309
Ten minutes. Twenty?

10:04.687 --> 10:06.606
Wow, your sign language's gotten good.

10:07.481 --> 10:08.733
I understand that.

10:10.067 --> 10:10.943
You got 10 minutes.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.707
Shit...

11:09.460 --> 11:10.711
The fuck's going on?

11:17.635 --> 11:18.469
The hell you doing?

11:19.303 --> 11:20.971
Seems the motel's been sold.

11:21.972 --> 11:25.851
We deserve a severance package.
Haven't we cleaned up after you enough?

11:26.727 --> 11:27.937
How much do you want?

11:29.313 --> 11:30.147
What do I owe?

11:32.525 --> 11:35.778
Severance pay? You sure?

11:35.778 --> 11:38.197
You don't want insurance as well,
you son of a bitch?

11:40.616 --> 11:43.369
What else? Need paternal leave?

11:53.671 --> 11:55.005
God damn!

12:04.265 --> 12:05.599
You motherfucker.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.771
On days like today,

12:12.815 --> 12:14.400
when it rains like this,

12:16.819 --> 12:18.446
evidence can get lost

12:19.196 --> 12:20.740
and it's easy to dig a hole.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.393
PARK YEON-JIN

13:00.780 --> 13:01.614
VIDEO

13:38.067 --> 13:39.068
Hey, stop!

14:35.457 --> 14:37.376
<i>The NFS described
the murder weapon</i>

14:37.376 --> 14:39.753
as a round object
with a large surface area.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.672
I think this is it.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.551
But it doesn't make sense.
The evidence was just sitting here.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.388
The CCTVs are all busted.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.807
Apparently, the owner
stripped the computer.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.976
Nothing makes sense here.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.271
How did you find out about this place?

14:57.938 --> 14:59.189
From an anonymous tip.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.582
Ye-sol, Uncle Jae-jun's here!

15:18.626 --> 15:19.585
Ye-sol, it's Uncle...

15:21.170 --> 15:22.922
It's your father. I'm your dad!

15:23.756 --> 15:25.341
You thought I was your uncle, right?

15:26.550 --> 15:28.886
I'm your real dad, Ye-sol.
I'll explain everything.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.429
Your dad has...

15:32.806 --> 15:34.558
Samsung electronics and stocks for you!

15:34.558 --> 15:37.811
Excuse me. Ye-sol isn't here.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.022
That there's Sae-mi.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.443
I heard Ye-sol transferred
to a school overseas.

15:45.819 --> 15:46.654
Transferred?

15:49.990 --> 15:52.159
Do-yeong, you motherfucker.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.911
Why didn't you say something earlier?

15:57.039 --> 15:59.833
HA DO-YEONG

16:01.877 --> 16:03.796
<i>The number
you're trying is no longer...</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:04.880
Shit!

16:11.595 --> 16:12.680
Where's Ye-sol?

16:13.597 --> 16:16.100
Where are you hiding her? Where is she?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.935
<i>I've always wondered, Jae-jun,</i>

16:17.935 --> 16:20.688
<i>who the last face
you would ever see would belong to.</i>

16:21.605 --> 16:24.608
<i>I guess we now know
it won't be your daughter's.</i>

16:24.608 --> 16:27.194
So then where the fuck are you now,

16:27.194 --> 16:28.779
you goddamn whore?!

16:33.951 --> 16:34.952
Shit.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.624
Where the hell is building B?

17:00.936 --> 17:03.272
Fuck, what the hell? Ah, shit!

17:04.356 --> 17:05.441
My eyes.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.825
You know her, don't you?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.038
That's Yeon-jin's mother.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.459
Hong Yeong-ae. She's involved
in a vehicular manslaughter case.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.919
We initially thought
it was just an accident,

17:26.712 --> 17:28.964
but when we looked
at her cell phone records,

17:29.673 --> 17:32.426
we found that the victim
had been blackmailing her.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.804
The text read,
"I know your daughter's a murderer."

17:38.515 --> 17:41.268
Okay. Why are you telling me this?

17:42.770 --> 17:44.271
I thought you'd already know.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.609
I believe you're the one who gave
Lee Seok-jae the information on Yeon-jin.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.196
But I couldn't find the connection
between you two.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.865
Not until I looked up
his wife's phone records.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.700
Kang Hyeon-nam.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.619
You know her, don't you?

18:03.624 --> 18:05.042
The thing is, Detective,

18:05.959 --> 18:09.379
I'm known for having
a wide circle of friends.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.050
Even if I did speak
to the victim or his wife,

18:13.717 --> 18:15.135
is that against the law?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.639
I mean, she was the one driving.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.768
You're right. It's not illegal.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.234
So what's going to happen

18:31.360 --> 18:32.778
to Yeon-jin's mom now?

18:35.322 --> 18:37.908
Ms. Hong, I should be
at the station with your daughter now.

18:37.908 --> 18:38.867
Are you some moron?

18:38.867 --> 18:41.203
You're the reason I'm even in this mess!

18:41.203 --> 18:43.288
Was it so hard to settle with her? Huh?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.206
God.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.876
Why are you not home now? Excuse me!

18:47.876 --> 18:49.545
How are you not there?

18:50.546 --> 18:52.381
Hey! Are you home?

18:52.381 --> 18:53.715
Hey! Get out here!

18:54.383 --> 18:55.551
Hello, Ms. Hong.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.021
Hong Yeong-ae was just arrested.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.065
For murder.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.787
Is that how it should end?

19:25.205 --> 19:27.124
You planned all of this, didn't you?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.209
That tip came from you.

19:39.845 --> 19:40.846
I appreciate

19:42.723 --> 19:45.642
that you've taken the time
to listen to me.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.988
I had to, even if I'm 18 years late.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.701
This concludes my investigation.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.039
So, this is goodbye.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.710
Ah.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.795
Since I've been so busy,

20:14.838 --> 20:17.341
I won't have time
to focus on this case anymore.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.188
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

20:58.382 --> 20:59.841
Be sure to get a good lawyer.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.762
I've always believed
you should spare no expense

21:04.554 --> 21:06.348
when it comes to legal issues.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.478
You can be so cruel, honey.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.483
How could you come serve these in person?

21:22.447 --> 21:23.740
Where are you going?

21:26.034 --> 21:28.287
Don't worry. I won't follow.

21:30.998 --> 21:31.999
The UK.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.876
Ye-sol likes soccer, after all.

21:38.588 --> 21:39.756
If I write,

21:42.009 --> 21:43.844
will you give my letters to Ye-sol?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.766
Take care of yourself.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.103
The car's registered under your name.
The title's in the glove compartment.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.773
Ms. Moon asked that I give it to you.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.108
She wanted to thank you
for all you've done.

22:41.651 --> 22:42.861
The car is for you

22:43.862 --> 22:45.989
to go to all those places
you've always wanted to.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.118
Where's Dong-eun? Did she go somewhere?

22:50.118 --> 22:53.997
She wanted to leave this with someone
who would do something good with it.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.755
And she'd be happy
with whatever decision you made,

23:02.297 --> 23:04.341
whether you donate it or open a center.

23:05.258 --> 23:08.220
But she wanted you to treat yourself
to some good food, too.

23:09.012 --> 23:13.266
Ms. Moon told me... to thank you again,

23:13.266 --> 23:15.644
and that she's
very grateful for everything.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.896
Did Dong-eun go somewhere?

23:19.898 --> 23:21.108
Where'd she go?

23:54.808 --> 23:55.725
Hey, what's up?

23:56.226 --> 23:59.062
<i>Do you want to go
to the ocean with me?</i>

24:01.731 --> 24:03.733
That's like the oldest line in the book.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.825
You can put on some music if you'd like.
Or sleep if you're tired.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.327
Ah, and look at me every now and then.

24:15.036 --> 24:18.790
Because you know the passenger seat
is the best place to admire my face.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.003
I don't have any music on my phone.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.796
Maybe you should sing.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.715
What? About time!

24:27.716 --> 24:28.717
Just you wait. Really.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.264
Five, six, seven eight.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.950
Is this singing like a bird?

24:53.950 --> 24:57.996
Right now it's more like a falcon
than a bird. You know, like the band.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.347
<i>Don't you know any other songs?</i>

25:58.515 --> 25:59.933
<i>Stop, enough, seriously!</i>

26:01.351 --> 26:02.811
-<i>You try.</i>
-<i>No!</i>

26:02.811 --> 26:04.521
-<i>Just one?</i>
-<i>No!</i>

26:13.113 --> 26:15.323
I got some more beer. Need anything else?

26:16.616 --> 26:18.743
<i>This is our final stop.</i>

26:20.704 --> 26:22.038
<i>It ends here.</i>

26:24.249 --> 26:25.250
<i>Goodbye.</i>

27:10.295 --> 27:12.547
<i>What took you so long to visit?</i>

27:15.216 --> 27:16.968
I was dying to see you.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.053
Me too.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.181
I really wanted to see you like this.

27:21.681 --> 27:22.974
Locked up in here.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.144
Completely and totally alone,

27:26.978 --> 27:28.813
without a single friend remaining.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.023
No one to love you.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.277
You...

27:36.029 --> 27:37.614
really think I'll be here long?

27:38.198 --> 27:39.282
Of course I do.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.119
- Even if you get out, you'll be so old--
- You bitch!

27:43.119 --> 27:46.081
3886, quiet down!

27:52.045 --> 27:53.630
After all this is done,

27:55.048 --> 27:57.133
whether I'm in the ground or not,

27:58.259 --> 28:00.387
I want your world to always have me in it.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.808
I want you to regret your life

28:05.934 --> 28:07.352
so much you can feel it.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.355
Deep in your bones.

28:15.610 --> 28:16.611
I'm sorry...

28:18.655 --> 28:20.365
that I didn't get away with it.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.367
Regret?

28:24.619 --> 28:25.620
You know...

28:30.458 --> 28:32.377
I should be asking you the same thing.

28:34.587 --> 28:35.672
Why would I?

28:38.049 --> 28:39.551
What do I have to regret?

29:54.834 --> 29:56.002
Gyeong-ran...

29:58.505 --> 29:59.881
You're back there, right?

30:01.424 --> 30:02.425
Are you there?

30:10.099 --> 30:12.268
Gyeong-ran...

30:14.020 --> 30:17.774
Fucking help me. Help me.

30:18.358 --> 30:23.071
Can't you go get...
go get my fucking phone? Huh?

30:25.573 --> 30:27.617
Help me, you stupid bitch!

30:31.079 --> 30:31.913
Get off!

30:32.622 --> 30:33.540
Stop!

30:34.999 --> 30:36.251
Please let go.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.418
Let go!

30:37.418 --> 30:39.629
Come on, don't tease me now.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.467
You don't like it?
Don't lie. I know you like it.

30:44.467 --> 30:45.802
Let go!

30:45.802 --> 30:46.970
Get off!

30:48.763 --> 30:51.307
Let go of me, you son of a bitch!

31:21.337 --> 31:23.256
<i>It's me, Gyeong-ran.</i>

31:24.007 --> 31:26.509
<i>I need your help, Dong-eun.</i>

31:28.052 --> 31:29.470
You told me that...

31:30.555 --> 31:32.181
Yeon-jin needs to be the killer.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.809
I...

31:36.436 --> 31:37.604
don't know what to do.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.691
Please help me, Dong-eun.

31:42.942 --> 31:43.943
How do I...

31:45.361 --> 31:46.487
fix this?

31:50.533 --> 31:52.201
This should go back to Siesta.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.203
Try not to worry.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.539
Yeon-jin still killed Myeong-o,
so this changes nothing.

32:00.543 --> 32:01.794
Thank you

32:02.962 --> 32:04.047
for helping me.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.718
And I'm... sorry...

32:13.973 --> 32:15.475
for what I did back then.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.143
Forgive me.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.900
I didn't come to help you.

32:24.984 --> 32:27.028
Wherever you end up, whatever you do,

32:28.529 --> 32:30.156
I never want you to forget this.

32:30.823 --> 32:31.658
Listen.

32:32.909 --> 32:35.912
I'm no longer standing in that hallway.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.331
You don't have to either.

32:39.707 --> 32:42.877
Don't stay in that gym
for one second more.

33:06.275 --> 33:08.361
What then? Spit it out!

33:09.946 --> 33:11.447
What do I have to regret?

33:11.447 --> 33:13.950
3886, your visit's over.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.584
I regret everything that's happened.

33:24.502 --> 33:27.588
Just look. Heaven's never been on my side.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.299
All you get is prison?

33:31.175 --> 33:32.593
I have no choice

33:33.886 --> 33:35.722
but to hope this prison's your hell.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.475
All I can do is pray that you live

33:40.101 --> 33:41.602
a very long life in this hell,

33:41.602 --> 33:44.772
never knowing the truth
about why you're here.

33:45.898 --> 33:49.068
What is it? Tell me, what don't I know?

33:49.068 --> 33:50.737
Just fucking tell me, Dong-eun!

33:50.737 --> 33:54.490
You bitch, I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to fucking kill you, bitch!

33:54.490 --> 33:57.744
Stop! Stop! You fucking bitch!

33:58.411 --> 33:59.454
You fucking bitch!

34:00.246 --> 34:02.498
I'm going to find you
and tear your head off!

34:04.959 --> 34:06.544
Let me do the honor.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.757
<i>I'll be the one</i>

34:12.091 --> 34:13.342
<i>to kill myself.</i>

34:15.261 --> 34:20.308
<i>So let's just say
our goodbyes to each other now.</i>

34:26.064 --> 34:29.358
<i>Dear Yeon-jin,
who I've always dreamed of killing,</i>

34:31.110 --> 34:32.111
<i>goodbye.</i>

34:32.987 --> 34:37.575
<i>This is my last letter to you.</i>

34:39.410 --> 34:40.620
<i>And to everyone else,</i>

34:42.163 --> 34:42.997
<i>farewell.</i>

34:44.415 --> 34:45.833
<i>I hope the end burned,</i>

34:47.043 --> 34:48.336
<i>like it did for me.</i>

34:50.505 --> 34:53.424
<i>I hope... it was painful.</i>

36:00.324 --> 36:01.492
Help me!

36:02.869 --> 36:04.162
Please help me!

36:07.206 --> 36:09.709
Please help me save my son!

36:14.547 --> 36:16.883
I'm Yeo-jeong's mother.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.140
If this was the ending
you were preparing for,

36:24.640 --> 36:26.017
would you change your mind

36:28.394 --> 36:33.024
if you knew that this would
end Yeo-jeong's life as well?

36:38.738 --> 36:40.323
I met with So-hee's mother.

36:41.532 --> 36:44.702
And she told me all about you.

36:45.995 --> 36:48.748
She told me what had happened to you

36:49.248 --> 36:50.917
and how you ended up here.

36:52.919 --> 36:55.296
But this isn't how it should end,
not after everything.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.511
When Yeo-jeong told me he was
determined to help you get revenge,

37:02.511 --> 37:04.013
I gave him my permission.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.933
I'm asking for your permission now.

37:07.433 --> 37:11.312
Will you allow me to save your life today?

37:13.689 --> 37:16.984
Because even if it means
I have to hang onto you as you jump,

37:16.984 --> 37:19.320
I'm going to save you. I swear to God.

37:22.865 --> 37:26.911
I'm asking you to help my son
escape this hell, so that...

37:28.913 --> 37:30.873
he will choose to go on living.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.793
I'm begging you to live.

37:44.637 --> 37:48.516
Is Yeo-jeong's hell
Kang Yeong-cheon, then?

37:51.686 --> 37:55.523
3724, referring to his prison number.

37:59.485 --> 38:00.403
That's right.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.907
That disgusting bastard.

38:14.041 --> 38:16.377
<i>Even now,
that day remains in my memory,</i>

38:16.377 --> 38:18.212
<i>vivid as if it were yesterday.</i>

38:18.754 --> 38:21.382
<i>The scent of his blood in my nostrils.</i>

38:22.133 --> 38:25.553
<i>That slicing sound
as the knife pierced his throat.</i>

38:26.929 --> 38:29.432
<i>The heat of his blood
as it dripped down my hands.</i>

38:29.432 --> 38:32.685
<i>And even the look on his face
as the life left his eyes.</i>

38:32.685 --> 38:36.188
Dad! Dad! Dad!

38:36.188 --> 38:38.399
Dad! Move, Move!

38:38.399 --> 38:40.192
Dad!

38:40.192 --> 38:42.028
Dad, wake up!

38:42.611 --> 38:43.779
Wake up!

38:45.323 --> 38:46.907
Wake up!

38:48.326 --> 38:51.203
Wake up!

38:53.331 --> 38:57.043
Dad, your son is calling you! Wake up!

38:57.877 --> 39:00.463
The defendant has been indicted

39:00.463 --> 39:01.881
for three counts of murder

39:01.881 --> 39:04.467
in addition to the desecration
and disposal of a corpse.

39:05.343 --> 39:09.472
Based on the evidence that has
been brought forth by the investigation,

39:09.472 --> 39:13.726
the court has found the accused
to be guilty on all charges.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.563
In addition,
the defendant murdered the doctor

39:17.563 --> 39:19.482
who was providing him medical treatment

39:19.482 --> 39:21.859
with a clear lack of remorse.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.154
Not only did his actions
have serious consequences,

39:25.154 --> 39:27.782
but the method itself was inhumane.

39:28.282 --> 39:32.912
And as a result,
the court has now come to a verdict.

39:34.121 --> 39:34.955
The defendant

39:36.665 --> 39:39.001
has been sentenced to death,

39:40.586 --> 39:44.256
in accordance to Article Three
of Criminal Act One.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.434
You son of a bitch!

39:56.602 --> 39:57.520
I'll kill you!

39:57.520 --> 39:58.521
Yeo-jeong!

39:58.521 --> 40:00.940
Why are you laughing, you asshole?

40:02.525 --> 40:04.527
<i>I have always loved</i>

40:04.527 --> 40:08.447
<i>the look on someone's face
at the moment of their death.</i>

40:09.323 --> 40:10.825
<i>The vessels in their eyes burst,</i>

40:10.825 --> 40:13.828
<i>and slowly the blood colors
the whites of their eyes.</i>

40:13.828 --> 40:15.079
<i>Just like a sunset.</i>

40:17.039 --> 40:18.749
<i>I promise I'll write again soon.</i>

40:31.053 --> 40:34.181
<i>Take care and enjoy your weekend, Dr. Joo.</i>

40:48.279 --> 40:51.282
SIX MONTHS LATER

40:51.282 --> 40:54.368
SUMMER OF 2023

41:30.112 --> 41:30.946
Mom?

41:32.031 --> 41:32.865
Mom!

41:32.865 --> 41:35.743
- Inmate! Keep your mouth shut!
- Hey, Mom!

41:35.743 --> 41:38.454
- 3886, face the wall!
- Mom! Mom!

41:38.996 --> 41:41.373
Please, Mom, please!

41:42.041 --> 41:44.960
Mom! Mom!

41:56.180 --> 41:59.391
Hey, cutie.
What's the weather like tomorrow?

42:00.309 --> 42:01.143
Huh?

42:13.822 --> 42:14.782
For these past few days,

42:14.782 --> 42:17.284
all the rain we've received
has made the temperature drop.

42:17.284 --> 42:19.161
However, tomorrow
temperatures will warm up

42:19.161 --> 42:22.665
and rise close to 30 degrees Celsius
around mid-day.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.376
I recommend you wear some light clothes,

42:25.376 --> 42:27.753
and make sure you stay hydrated
throughout the day.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.885
Although we expect no clouds
and pollution will be low,

42:35.386 --> 42:38.722
the ozone levels
and the UV radiation will be very high.

42:39.765 --> 42:43.686
Try not to say out in the sun
between the hours of 2:00 and 5:00 p.m.,

42:46.522 --> 42:49.441
when the ozone level
will be at its highest.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.402
Park Yeon-jin signing off.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.697
Are you crying
about the weather?

43:16.969 --> 43:20.389
I thought you wouldn't last
a month here. Looks like I was wrong.

43:20.389 --> 43:21.390
You made it six.

43:22.975 --> 43:23.892
Yeah.

43:24.518 --> 43:26.186
It's already summer.

43:27.730 --> 43:30.149
I looked deeper
into that bitch and that bastard.

43:30.149 --> 43:32.067
You were absolutely right, Ms. Moon.

43:33.819 --> 43:35.487
Thank you for looking out for me.

43:37.239 --> 43:40.326
Well, I know nothing ever comes for free.

43:41.702 --> 43:44.747
Now tell me why
you've been staying here so long.

43:49.251 --> 43:50.669
I need some information.

43:51.503 --> 43:54.048
There's a prisoner serving in Cheongsong.

43:57.426 --> 44:00.929
Prisoners are sorted into five tiers,
ranging from S-1 to S-5.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.932
Cheongsong is where S-4 prisoners go.

44:07.061 --> 44:10.648
I don't know who it is, but I can guess
they're one nasty piece of work.

44:10.648 --> 44:14.443
Yeah. Two of his victims
were innocent women.

44:15.861 --> 44:18.322
Could he be transferred?

44:23.202 --> 44:25.621
You would need to stir up trouble
at the prison to do that.

44:28.707 --> 44:31.543
There's only one place
that's worse than Cheongsong.

44:32.127 --> 44:33.545
Jisan Prison.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.091
Is that what you're looking for?

44:46.809 --> 44:48.310
Come find me if you need a loan.

44:48.310 --> 44:50.896
For you, I won't take
any interest in advance.

44:50.896 --> 44:51.897
You may need it.

46:49.473 --> 46:50.682
I brought us some beer.

47:05.155 --> 47:06.490
How have you been?

47:08.534 --> 47:10.202
Uh, how have I been?

47:13.330 --> 47:14.331
You're so...

47:18.544 --> 47:19.545
cruel.

47:23.632 --> 47:25.050
How could you do this to me?

47:29.805 --> 47:30.806
Do you...

47:33.350 --> 47:34.768
have any idea...

47:35.519 --> 47:36.895
I've really missed you.

47:44.027 --> 47:46.196
Then why did you leave me again?

47:51.076 --> 47:52.911
Maybe it was out of love,

47:52.911 --> 47:54.496
and not for revenge.

48:06.466 --> 48:07.467
I haven't...

48:10.637 --> 48:11.722
been doing very well.

48:15.767 --> 48:16.852
My revenge...

48:19.521 --> 48:20.814
didn't go as I planned.

48:26.028 --> 48:28.030
I think you just need some lessons.

48:28.530 --> 48:31.700
Would you let me teach you how?

48:41.627 --> 48:43.629
From now on, I will be your executioner.

48:44.796 --> 48:47.215
I will be your missing 1%.

48:48.300 --> 48:49.301
Just tell me,

48:50.385 --> 48:52.262
who do you want me to kill first?

48:58.602 --> 49:01.897
Since this is your first time,
you get the black stone.

49:03.732 --> 49:05.484
I'll place the stone on the board.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.268
EDEN APARTMENTS
ROOM 301 AVAILABLE FOR RENT

49:40.268 --> 49:42.688
<i>I'm sorry
I didn't come say goodbye in person.</i>

49:43.522 --> 49:45.023
<i>You can put up my room for rent.</i>

49:46.441 --> 49:50.737
<i>Now I know why room 301
was cheaper than the others.</i>

49:51.697 --> 49:52.698
<i>I remember.</i>

49:54.533 --> 49:57.619
<i>I remember everything.</i>

49:59.955 --> 50:01.373
You sure took your time.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.210
I knew from the moment I saw you.

51:08.190 --> 51:09.691
Are you okay?

51:10.192 --> 51:11.693
You don't have any shoes on.

51:12.861 --> 51:15.322
Why are you only wearing
a sweater out here?

51:16.114 --> 51:17.699
It must be so heavy.

51:17.699 --> 51:18.617
You're kidding!

51:18.617 --> 51:21.203
You're the reason why
I'm out here soaking wet!

51:21.203 --> 51:24.915
Really? Seriously?
I'm the only one you're blaming?

51:25.499 --> 51:28.543
I saw you get into the water
with the same intention as me.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.129
Let me ask you a question.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.716
The water's too cold, isn't it?

51:34.716 --> 51:36.426
Oh, it's freezing.

51:38.386 --> 51:39.221
Let's...

51:40.555 --> 51:42.891
die in the spring. Hmm?

51:43.558 --> 51:44.392
The spring.

52:01.660 --> 52:02.661
It'll be okay.

52:09.334 --> 52:10.335
Okay.

52:10.877 --> 52:13.296
<i>There was a time
when I used to think,</i>

52:14.214 --> 52:16.925
<i>"What if someone had just helped me?"</i>

52:17.676 --> 52:20.554
<i>"If someone, somewhere
had been there for me?"</i>

52:23.056 --> 52:28.103
<i>Eighteen springs had gone by
with that question still in my mind.</i>

52:29.146 --> 52:30.981
<i>But I finally realized something.</i>

52:32.190 --> 52:35.485
<i>That there were good people in my life.</i>

52:36.611 --> 52:39.156
<i>Good friends, good weather.</i>

52:39.656 --> 52:41.283
<i>Even heaven intervened.</i>

52:41.283 --> 52:43.535
Is she the one
who had the best portfolio?

52:43.535 --> 52:46.288
Yeah.
I heard she hasn't even declared a major.

52:46.288 --> 52:48.248
Did you see that? Look at her arms?

52:49.040 --> 52:50.250
Oh.

52:54.921 --> 52:58.758
<i>And when you said
we should die in the spring,</i>

52:59.342 --> 53:00.468
<i>what you really meant is,</i>

53:01.052 --> 53:02.679
<i>that's when we should bloom.</i>

53:03.805 --> 53:04.931
<i>I want to thank you.</i>

53:06.474 --> 53:08.435
<i>Thank you so much for saving me.</i>

53:09.728 --> 53:11.438
<i>While I know I didn't grow up to be good,</i>

53:12.814 --> 53:16.109
<i>eventually a spring will come</i>

53:17.068 --> 53:18.528
<i>when I will fully bloom.</i>

53:19.988 --> 53:23.617
<i>I wish you a long, healthy life.</i>

53:24.743 --> 53:28.955
I wonder if she'll come see the flowers.

53:57.484 --> 54:00.111
JISAN PRISON, JOO YEO-JEONG
MEDICAL OFFICER

54:02.989 --> 54:05.408
Hey, come on. You're working, aren't you?

54:05.408 --> 54:08.703
Of course I am.
Revenge isn't exactly cheap.

54:09.746 --> 54:11.414
I'll help you once I text this student.

54:14.209 --> 54:15.961
I guess this'll be every night.

54:15.961 --> 54:19.381
I'll only teach Mondays,
Wednesday and Fridays, okay?

54:20.173 --> 54:22.926
Besides, this student's father
works for the correctional system.

54:26.763 --> 54:28.431
Well, exams are important.

54:32.519 --> 54:33.353
By the way,

54:34.521 --> 54:36.606
where do you think Jae-jun ran off to?

54:38.233 --> 54:39.234
I don't know.

54:40.443 --> 54:42.821
I can only assume
that I wasn't the only one

54:43.905 --> 54:45.782
who wanted to see him taken down.

55:04.467 --> 55:05.468
Who's there?

55:06.886 --> 55:07.887
Where am I?

55:08.680 --> 55:10.932
Who the fuck are you, you son of a bitch?

55:11.641 --> 55:12.809
I'm sorry, please.

55:14.602 --> 55:16.771
My eyes really hurt right now.

55:17.314 --> 55:18.982
I think I need to go to a doctor.

55:18.982 --> 55:20.066
Shit.

55:21.401 --> 55:23.486
Hye-jeong, I know it's you. Huh?

55:23.987 --> 55:25.655
Did she send you to kill me?

55:25.655 --> 55:28.992
I'm sorry, but can you just
say something to me? Please?

55:30.952 --> 55:32.787
Who the hell are you? Huh?

55:33.621 --> 55:35.957
Why are you doing this to me,
you motherfucker?

56:30.136 --> 56:31.805
One burner and one car.

56:32.597 --> 56:34.099
The number's on the back of the phone

56:34.099 --> 56:36.267
and the unregistered car's
sitting in the back.

56:37.727 --> 56:38.561
Good luck.

56:49.781 --> 56:51.533
Hi, what can I get you?

56:51.533 --> 56:53.910
- Can I get 600 grams of this...
- Sure.

56:53.910 --> 56:55.829
...and 300 grams of this cabbage here?

56:55.829 --> 56:56.830
Sure.

56:56.830 --> 56:57.914
Hey, Mom!

57:03.128 --> 57:05.505
- What're you craving?
- I'll eat anything.

58:12.906 --> 58:14.908
<i>I'm looking for an assistant.</i>

58:14.908 --> 58:15.825
<i>Interested?</i>

59:19.556 --> 59:21.140
<i>3724, transfer.</i>

59:21.140 --> 59:22.183
BOOK DEBATE PROGRAM

59:22.183 --> 59:26.271
I would like to introduce the teacher
who has volunteered to lead debate class.

59:38.283 --> 59:39.367
Nice to meet you.

59:40.034 --> 59:42.912
It sounds rather formal
when you call it debate class.

59:42.912 --> 59:45.290
Especially as this is
meant for those of you

59:45.290 --> 59:47.542
who are scheduled to be released soon.

59:47.542 --> 59:50.128
This is more like a book club,

59:50.128 --> 59:52.213
where we can freely discuss
the material we've read.

59:53.047 --> 59:57.385
And for those of you that are willing,
we could even try writing resumes and CVs.

1:00:04.267 --> 1:00:07.854
My younger sister
just visited me.

1:00:09.647 --> 1:00:13.484
Every time she's come before, she's cried,
but for the first time, she smiled.

1:00:15.236 --> 1:00:16.321
So thank you, Doctor.

1:00:17.655 --> 1:00:19.741
Thank you for taking care of my sister.

1:00:21.409 --> 1:00:23.411
She'll need a few more laser treatments,

1:00:23.411 --> 1:00:25.830
but she should be able
to hide it with makeup.

1:00:27.165 --> 1:00:29.834
As for you, don't forget
to take your blood pressure pills.

1:00:29.834 --> 1:00:34.047
Sure. There's no way
I'll let that son of a bitch outlive me.

1:00:36.090 --> 1:00:38.885
Right. You're in here
for assaulting someone.

1:00:40.178 --> 1:00:41.137
I remember now.

1:00:41.137 --> 1:00:42.221
Yeah.

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:46.768
I regret I didn't kill that motherfucker
when I had the chance.

1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:50.730
You saw her scar.
That was that asshole's work.

1:00:51.731 --> 1:00:52.732
He did that 'cause...

1:00:54.484 --> 1:00:55.693
she refused to sleep with him.

1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:01.324
Try not to worry about your sister.
I like to think I'm pretty good at my job.

1:01:01.324 --> 1:01:02.575
No, of course.

1:01:03.451 --> 1:01:05.286
You don't have to tell me.

1:01:07.330 --> 1:01:08.623
I've heard removing scars

1:01:09.582 --> 1:01:11.584
can be a very expensive procedure.

1:01:13.252 --> 1:01:17.173
When I get out of here,
I'll do whatever it takes to pay you back.

1:01:17.173 --> 1:01:18.508
Whatever it is.

1:01:20.051 --> 1:01:22.387
Doctor, I swear to God.

1:01:24.722 --> 1:01:27.058
You have a cleaning job
in quarter one, right?

1:01:28.518 --> 1:01:31.771
Would you be interested in paying
with something other than money?

1:01:36.359 --> 1:01:37.360
Really?

1:01:39.195 --> 1:01:40.279
You don't want money?

1:01:40.988 --> 1:01:42.699
To me, this'll be worth a fortune.

1:02:40.298 --> 1:02:42.300
<i>Do you want to be
the one to punish me?</i>

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:54.270
Yeah.

1:02:55.897 --> 1:02:58.858
Then it's too bad
that I'm already being punished, isn't it?

1:03:04.405 --> 1:03:05.573
It's not enough.

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:09.368
So in your opinion, what would be enough?

1:03:09.952 --> 1:03:10.953
Ah.

1:03:14.415 --> 1:03:15.666
Killing you.

1:03:16.751 --> 1:03:18.169
And making it painful.

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:20.755
But you're a doctor, yeah?

1:03:21.923 --> 1:03:24.926
Isn't there some kind of line
you're not allowed to cross?

1:03:28.179 --> 1:03:30.389
I was never good at school, but I know.

1:03:30.973 --> 1:03:34.185
There's an oath every doctor has to obey.

1:03:37.730 --> 1:03:38.731
Mmm.

1:03:46.155 --> 1:03:47.073
You're wrong.

1:03:48.282 --> 1:03:51.577
If I wanted to save animals,
I would've become a veterinarian.

1:03:52.453 --> 1:03:55.748
And if I wanted to save the devil,
I would've become a preacher.

1:03:56.249 --> 1:03:58.042
My job's to save people.

1:03:59.418 --> 1:04:00.419
So that oath

1:04:01.838 --> 1:04:04.090
doesn't apply to something
as inhuman as you.

1:04:10.096 --> 1:04:12.723
If by some chance
the two of us happen to meet again,

1:04:14.308 --> 1:04:15.643
you should be careful.

1:04:17.353 --> 1:04:21.649
Anyone who walks by, any food you eat,

1:04:21.649 --> 1:04:23.651
any pill prescribed to you,

1:04:25.319 --> 1:04:27.738
I'd make sure it's safe.

1:04:32.785 --> 1:04:34.370
Doctors can't do that.

1:04:37.081 --> 1:04:38.499
<i>I'm not worried.</i>

1:04:39.667 --> 1:04:41.085
I won't get caught,

1:04:42.003 --> 1:04:43.170
because I am a doctor.

1:05:15.912 --> 1:05:19.165
YOON SO-HEE

1:05:20.666 --> 1:05:23.336
<i>The clock is
ticking again, So-hee.</i>

1:05:24.629 --> 1:05:25.713
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1:05:26.422 --> 1:05:29.425
<i>We're both finally 19.</i>

1:05:32.303 --> 1:05:36.557
JISAN PRISON

1:06:31.112 --> 1:06:31.946
I love you.

1:06:37.368 --> 1:06:38.536
I love you.
