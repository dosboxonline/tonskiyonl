WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.693
[Shaun] You should
put this on now.

00:03.727 --> 00:06.109
My contractions are still
nine minutes apart,

00:06.144 --> 00:08.353
and they're not... [gasps]

00:08.387 --> 00:10.217
not that bad.

00:10.251 --> 00:13.392
They are now 8 minutes
and 45 seconds apart.

00:13.427 --> 00:16.292
We should get pancakes.
Where's my sweater?

00:16.326 --> 00:19.019
I don't want pancakes.
I want you to put this on.

00:19.053 --> 00:22.539
Shoot-- I forgot
my lucky socks.

00:22.574 --> 00:24.300
The ones I wore last time
I was in the hospital...

00:24.334 --> 00:26.060
when my brilliant husband
came up

00:26.095 --> 00:27.786
with a miracle surgery
to save our baby.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.132
Those are
hospital socks.

00:29.167 --> 00:31.479
They are identical to
all the other hospital socks.

00:31.514 --> 00:32.998
I will get you
another pair.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.242
But they won't be
my lucky ones.

00:35.276 --> 00:37.071
-I'll go home and get them.
-N-No.

00:37.106 --> 00:39.315
You need to stay here.
And put this on.

00:39.349 --> 00:41.386
And get hooked up
to a fetal monitor.

00:41.420 --> 00:42.904
I will get the socks.

00:45.252 --> 00:46.839
Okay.

00:54.295 --> 00:56.884
How long after we get there
will the surgery start?

00:57.747 --> 00:58.989
You'll go straight
to the pre-op,

00:59.024 --> 01:01.268
where they'll do
a chest X-ray and echo.

01:01.302 --> 01:03.546
Oh, why waste time with that?
I need a new valve.

01:03.580 --> 01:04.926
There's no mystery here.

01:04.961 --> 01:06.583
We'll also need blood
and urine samples.

01:06.618 --> 01:08.689
Huh. I can give you that
right now.

01:08.723 --> 01:10.553
That's...
not necessary.

01:10.587 --> 01:12.348
Efficiency, boys.

01:12.382 --> 01:14.867
Clearly, none of you
have been in the military.

01:14.902 --> 01:16.904
[ringing]

01:19.286 --> 01:21.045
Yeah. We're Oscar-Mike
from the nursing home,

01:21.081 --> 01:22.806
but some dense fog
put us behind schedule.

01:22.841 --> 01:24.256
Yeah. Make sure
the O.R. is prepped

01:24.291 --> 01:26.707
and Dr. Park is
at the ready for Mr. Ermey
when we get there.

01:26.741 --> 01:28.226
On the double.

01:28.260 --> 01:29.365
Your dad a Marine?

01:29.399 --> 01:30.607
Brother.

01:30.642 --> 01:33.231
-Oorah.
-[chuckles]

01:33.265 --> 01:36.406
Okay. Just make sure
your "dense fog" excuse

01:36.441 --> 01:38.443
is only for your
critical care transport

01:38.477 --> 01:39.582
and not dinner tonight.

01:39.616 --> 01:41.308
Um, dress code?

01:41.342 --> 01:42.860
To the nines.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.000
Going tens.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.318
[tires screech, horn blares]

01:51.352 --> 01:53.561
[crashes]

01:54.390 --> 01:55.460
Hello?

01:55.494 --> 01:56.495
Danny?

01:57.738 --> 01:59.395
You there?

01:59.429 --> 02:00.499
Danny?

02:00.534 --> 02:01.742
[disconnection beep]

02:01.776 --> 02:03.537
[groans]

02:03.571 --> 02:06.574
[groans]

02:10.785 --> 02:11.993
You okay?

02:12.028 --> 02:15.928
My knee's kind of messed up,
but otherwise okay.

02:15.963 --> 02:17.516
[groans]

02:17.551 --> 02:20.001
Mr. Ermey?
We've been in a crash.

02:20.036 --> 02:21.106
All right.
We're gonna get you down.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.245
-Okay.
-All right.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.936
-You got his legs?
-Yeah.

02:23.971 --> 02:25.110
All right.
three, two, one.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.181
[groans] Gotcha.

02:27.216 --> 02:28.389
-All right.
-Take his armband off.

02:28.424 --> 02:30.805
-Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all right.
-Watch your head.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.324
[groans]

02:32.359 --> 02:34.671
Okay.
I'm gonna unstrap you.

02:34.706 --> 02:35.845
-Okay.
-All right. You ready?

02:35.879 --> 02:37.329
-Mm-hmm.
-Three-two, one.

02:37.364 --> 02:39.504
-[bones crack]
-Oh! I'm good.
I'm good.

02:39.538 --> 02:40.712
-You good?
-Yeah, yeah.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.819
[sighs] Okay.

02:48.685 --> 02:49.686
[grunts]

02:50.825 --> 02:53.034
[girls crying]

02:58.661 --> 03:00.870
The truck came over the line.
I had nowhere to go.

03:00.904 --> 03:02.112
Are you all right?

03:02.147 --> 03:03.390
I think
my leg's broken.

03:03.424 --> 03:04.839
Okay. Stay up there.
I'll get to you.

03:05.564 --> 03:06.669
Can you reach
your radio?

03:06.703 --> 03:08.118
We're gonna need at least
five more ambulances.

03:08.153 --> 03:09.189
Got it.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.397
Danny, you take the driver
of the pick-up truck.

03:10.431 --> 03:11.950
-I'll get to the family.
-All right.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.020
[driver] Dispatch...

03:13.054 --> 03:14.366
[speaking indistinctly]

03:19.578 --> 03:20.959
It's gonna be okay, girls.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.029
Okay, I'm Jared.
I'm a doctor.

03:22.063 --> 03:23.513
-What's your name?
-Uh, uh, Kenny.

03:23.548 --> 03:24.859
[crying] I can't breathe.

03:24.894 --> 03:26.516
Kenny, any pain in your chest?
Trouble breathing?

03:26.551 --> 03:27.931
Uh, uh, I'm okay.
I'm okay. Help them.

03:27.966 --> 03:29.726
All right. You sit over there.
I'll get to them.

03:29.761 --> 03:31.659
[girls crying]

03:31.694 --> 03:33.005
Hey, girls.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.075
I'm gonna get you out
of these car seats

03:34.110 --> 03:35.215
so you can be
with your dad, okay?

03:35.249 --> 03:37.562
-What's your name?
-I'm Bea.

03:37.596 --> 03:40.081
-Okay, Bea.
-My sister's name is Ella.

03:40.116 --> 03:41.876
Okay. Okay.
All right.

03:41.911 --> 03:43.361
Let's get you
out of there.

03:43.395 --> 03:45.155
It's gonna be okay.

03:45.190 --> 03:47.019
Good job, Bea.
Well done.

03:47.054 --> 03:48.918
Ella, I'll be right back
for you, okay?

03:48.952 --> 03:50.713
Good job.
Now, you go to your dad.

03:50.747 --> 03:52.542
-There you go.
-I got you. I got you.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.617
He's alive!
He's alive!

03:58.652 --> 04:00.032
But pulse is
weak and thready.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.896
Hey.

04:01.931 --> 04:03.346
I'm gonna get you
out of here safe, all right?

04:03.381 --> 04:05.175
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.
I'm fine.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.108
All right.
Hold still, please.

04:07.143 --> 04:09.904
Okay, Ella. I'm Dr. Kalu.
Are you okay?

04:09.939 --> 04:13.011
My chest--
I can't breathe.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.116
[sobbing]

04:15.151 --> 04:17.911
Okay. Let's get you out
of here so you can be
with your dad, all right?

04:17.947 --> 04:19.120
Good job, Ella.

04:19.154 --> 04:21.985
I've got you. That's it.
You're doing so well.

04:22.019 --> 04:24.609
I've got you.
Get you under here.

04:24.643 --> 04:26.127
Come on.

04:26.162 --> 04:28.129
Okay. Good job, guys.

04:28.164 --> 04:30.062
-[vehicle approaching]
-Good job.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.135
No, no, no, no, no.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.276
No. Hey! Hey!

04:36.310 --> 04:38.485
Stop! Stop! Hey!

04:39.417 --> 04:40.659
Danny!

04:40.694 --> 04:42.627
[tires screech]

04:44.318 --> 04:47.252
[theme music playing]

05:04.131 --> 05:05.995
Lea's in labor.

05:06.029 --> 05:07.824
We're having
our baby today.

05:10.655 --> 05:11.932
Congratulations.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.663
[door closes]

05:24.324 --> 05:25.497
[elevator bell dings]

05:28.120 --> 05:29.501
Morning, ladies.

05:29.536 --> 05:32.124
Eden,
clocking in today?

05:32.159 --> 05:34.886
My trial had three participants
drop out at the last minute,

05:34.920 --> 05:37.267
and every available nanny
within 90 miles

05:37.302 --> 05:39.649
is either dumb, lazy,
or incompetent.

05:39.683 --> 05:41.789
Mommy Morgan has
very exacting standards.

05:41.824 --> 05:44.654
I'm willing to
lower them momentarily
if you're available.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.207
I just need a few minutes
to give my spiel

05:46.242 --> 05:48.624
to a room full of
perimenopausal IBS patients.

05:48.658 --> 05:50.557
I would, but I just got paged
to the E.R.

05:51.868 --> 05:53.214
[elevator bell dings]

05:56.735 --> 05:58.219
I'll stop by later.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.123
[exhales deeply]

06:05.157 --> 06:06.538
Be professional.

06:07.850 --> 06:09.334
At least five seriously injured

06:09.369 --> 06:11.750
multi-vehicle collision
patients are inbound,

06:11.785 --> 06:13.234
including Dr. Perez.

06:13.269 --> 06:14.581
I'll take
the first patient.

06:14.615 --> 06:17.031
Then Dr. Park,
then Andrews, Wolke, and Allen,

06:17.066 --> 06:18.239
in that order.

06:18.274 --> 06:20.276
Senior doctors, when you have
stabilized your patients,

06:20.310 --> 06:22.520
-please circle back
and assist the residents.
-[siren wailing]

06:22.554 --> 06:24.280
Take a deep breath,
everybody.

Driver of the last car
of the pile-up--
head-on collision.

06:26.593 --> 06:28.560
Conscious, has a pulse,
but not responding.

06:28.595 --> 06:31.598
Suspected cervical spinal cord
and brachial plexus injury.

06:31.632 --> 06:32.771
Chest hurts.

06:32.806 --> 06:34.946
Where's my phone?
I need to make a call.

06:34.980 --> 06:36.603
You'll get your phone call
soon, Mr. Ermey.

06:37.742 --> 06:39.329
Get an eFAST
and assess for shock.

06:39.364 --> 06:40.917
Let's fix that lac.

06:40.952 --> 06:42.194
I need to drain
the hemopericardium.

06:42.229 --> 06:43.886
Give FFP to control
the bleeding.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.751
Fracture of the right femoral
shaft and left distal radius.

06:46.784 --> 06:47.924
We got it.

06:47.959 --> 06:49.892
-Hey, are you okay?
-I'm-- I'm good.

06:49.926 --> 06:51.134
Where's Perez?

06:51.169 --> 06:52.515
Kalu is bringing him
in the last ambulance.

06:52.550 --> 06:54.552
So, he's
the least critical?

06:54.586 --> 06:56.070
He's...

06:56.105 --> 06:57.417
He'll be here soon.

06:59.142 --> 07:02.214
Multiple rib fractures
and associated pneumothorax.

07:02.249 --> 07:04.320
[groans] It hurts.

07:05.942 --> 07:07.910
Hey, I'm Dr. Wolke.

07:07.944 --> 07:09.256
We're gonna help you,
okay?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.436
Finally.

07:20.578 --> 07:21.544
[groans]

07:27.274 --> 07:29.000
Still no purposeful eye
or limb movements.

07:29.034 --> 07:30.173
Likely
a high c-spine fracture.

07:30.207 --> 07:32.452
Let's get her stabilized
for a trauma pan-scan.

07:33.867 --> 07:35.316
Massive right-side
hemopneumothorax,

07:35.351 --> 07:36.766
but she's holding her own
on vitals.

07:36.801 --> 07:38.250
-She needs a chest tube.
-What does that mean?

07:38.284 --> 07:39.907
-Is-- Is she gonna--
-She's gonna be okay.

07:39.942 --> 07:41.978
We just need to make sure
that you and the little one
are good.

07:42.013 --> 07:43.980
-If you could take a seat--
-I-I-I'm fine.
Just a bruise from my--

07:44.015 --> 07:45.465
Yes, I know you feel fine,
but we need to make sure.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.983
I-It's okay, Bea.

07:47.018 --> 07:48.468
Um, I-I-I got to
call my wife.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.987
She doesn't even know
any of this happened.

07:51.022 --> 07:52.472
[Jordan]
Abdominal ecchymosis,

07:52.506 --> 07:54.646
peritoneal hemorrhage,
possible hemothorax.

07:54.681 --> 07:55.923
You're bleeding everywhere.

07:55.957 --> 07:57.822
Call up to O.R. 2
for an emergency ex lap.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.341
No opioids.

08:00.376 --> 08:01.481
What?

08:01.929 --> 08:03.690
Just promise me.

08:03.724 --> 08:04.863
No opioids.

08:05.933 --> 08:07.348
Okay.

08:07.383 --> 08:08.867
[groans]

08:08.902 --> 08:10.490
Tell the anesthesiologist
opioid-free.

08:12.008 --> 08:13.596
Ella: Ow!

08:13.631 --> 08:15.702
Considerable
intraperitoneal fluid.

08:15.736 --> 08:18.325
She has a perforation and needs
abdominal surgery right away.

08:18.359 --> 08:20.085
No! Dad!

08:20.120 --> 08:21.811
It's gonna be okay, baby.

08:21.846 --> 08:24.020
Mommy will be here soon,
and we'll all play Scrabble.

08:24.055 --> 08:25.953
[sobbing]

08:27.196 --> 08:28.542
We think you suffered
a neck injury,

08:28.577 --> 08:30.371
but we need to get some images
so we can tell for sure.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.346
Hey.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.659
All stabilizing ligaments
have been completely severed.

08:45.145 --> 08:47.561
Internal decapitation.

08:47.596 --> 08:48.735
Have you ever worked
on one of these?

08:50.150 --> 08:51.807
Never even seen one.

09:00.194 --> 09:01.989
Why aren't you
in your patient room?

09:02.024 --> 09:03.715
Oh, I had some last-minute
e-mails to send,

09:03.750 --> 09:06.166
and my preggo-brain
forgot my laptop in here.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.270
Did you get my socks?

09:07.305 --> 09:09.376
Is there something wrong
with your room?

09:09.410 --> 09:11.723
We could get you
extra blankets.

09:14.899 --> 09:16.038
What is this?

09:16.072 --> 09:18.937
This is the cutest hat
I've ever seen.

09:21.388 --> 09:23.839
Oh!
I got one for each of us.

09:23.873 --> 09:26.773
Shaun, I love them.

09:31.225 --> 09:33.124
We should take it
to Glassy.

09:34.228 --> 09:36.679
We should
go to your room.

09:36.714 --> 09:39.544
I-I know things are...

09:39.579 --> 09:41.442
difficult between you two
right now,

09:41.477 --> 09:44.411
but his grandson
is being born today.

09:45.654 --> 09:47.034
He knows.

09:48.657 --> 09:51.073
He said, "Congratulations,"

09:51.107 --> 09:52.212
and then he shut the door.

09:53.247 --> 09:54.421
Mm.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.460
We need to get you hooked up
to a fetal monitor.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.263
The surgery went well.
We repaired Ella's
bowel perforation.

10:09.298 --> 10:11.058
[sighs]

10:11.093 --> 10:13.336
Mommy,
did you bring snacks?

10:14.683 --> 10:16.167
We'll go to the cafeteria
together

10:16.201 --> 10:17.927
as soon as we're done
talking to the doctors.

10:18.859 --> 10:19.826
When can she go home?

10:21.034 --> 10:23.761
Uh, there was some damage
to her spleen.

10:23.795 --> 10:25.901
Uh, we'll need to monitor that
for the next few days,

10:25.935 --> 10:27.143
make sure
it doesn't get worse.

10:27.178 --> 10:28.282
But I'll keep you
updated.

10:30.802 --> 10:33.011
I've got to be in the O.R.
in 10 minutes
for my valve replacement.

10:33.046 --> 10:35.945
Order a post-op CT
and run serial hematocrits.

10:41.813 --> 10:43.850
Mm. Sorry.

10:43.884 --> 10:46.300
I'm not used to having
consultations in my kitchen.

10:46.335 --> 10:49.476
I've never seen
that much separation
between skull and spine.

10:49.510 --> 10:51.098
Have you?
Not in anyone alive.

10:52.790 --> 10:55.275
I was thinking occipitocervical
fusion surgery

10:55.309 --> 10:57.795
using a plate
with four-point fixation

10:57.829 --> 10:59.520
and transpedicular
and translaminar screws.

11:01.350 --> 11:03.593
You're gonna have to add

11:03.628 --> 11:07.149
iliac crest graft
and Songer cables.

11:09.807 --> 11:12.361
You're looking
at over two hours
just to realign

11:12.395 --> 11:14.604
and stabilize
the skull and the spine,

11:14.639 --> 11:15.709
and then
the real work begins.

11:17.193 --> 11:18.885
Your odds of success
are somewhere

11:18.919 --> 11:22.923
between minimal
and nonexistent.

11:22.958 --> 11:26.237
Well, marathons are pointless,
but millions of people
run them anyway.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.205
Feel like running?

11:29.240 --> 11:31.173
I've been deemed "unfit."

11:31.207 --> 11:33.140
You wouldn't be cutting.
You'd be consulting.

11:34.003 --> 11:35.902
Flattering.

11:35.936 --> 11:38.698
You're still one of the world's
foremost experts

11:38.732 --> 11:40.492
on the brain and spine,

11:40.527 --> 11:42.667
and my patient's head
is hanging on by a thread.

11:45.049 --> 11:47.845
This one's scary.
I could use some help.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.850
Sure.

11:52.884 --> 11:55.818
I'm up for some...
color commentary.

12:00.029 --> 12:02.756
You have another contraction
coming in one to two seconds,

12:02.791 --> 12:03.964
and it is a big...

12:03.999 --> 12:05.690
[groans]

12:05.725 --> 12:06.933
...one.

12:06.967 --> 12:10.074
They are now six minutes apart
and increasing in intensity.

12:10.108 --> 12:12.732
We should have the nurse
check your dilation again.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.043
[knock on door]

12:15.286 --> 12:18.358
Hi. Big day.
Excited for you both.

12:18.392 --> 12:20.705
Everyone is busy
because of the accident--

12:20.740 --> 12:22.534
Lim is prepping, Andrews
and Park are in surgery--

12:22.569 --> 12:24.916
and I think my patient
is in trouble.

12:24.951 --> 12:27.022
Her latest CT shows
her splenic injury
is getting worse.

12:27.056 --> 12:28.678
How's Perez doing?

12:28.713 --> 12:30.232
They're just finishing up
his surgery now.

12:30.266 --> 12:32.821
Your patient needs
a splenic artery embolization.

12:32.855 --> 12:34.857
How long can she wait?
There are no
attendings available.

12:34.892 --> 12:35.858
She cannot wait.

12:37.204 --> 12:38.447
Shaun...

12:38.481 --> 12:40.794
you need to do the surgery.

12:40.829 --> 12:45.109
I...should be here with you,
to give you ice chips

12:45.143 --> 12:47.939
and hold your hand
and talk about the future.

12:47.974 --> 12:50.390
Have you been watching movies
about people having babies?

12:52.323 --> 12:53.462
I'm fine.

12:53.496 --> 12:55.809
I have hours to go before
the Peanut makes his debut,

12:55.844 --> 12:58.156
and how complicated
is this procedure?

12:58.191 --> 12:59.640
It is
quite straightforward.

13:00.883 --> 13:03.990
I love you, and I'm so happy
we're starting our family.

13:04.024 --> 13:06.958
But there's a little girl
who needs you.

13:09.616 --> 13:11.238
Please, go.

13:12.274 --> 13:14.138
Okay.
Prep the O.R.

13:16.278 --> 13:17.486
[chuckles]

13:19.799 --> 13:21.697
Do not have this baby
without me!

13:36.677 --> 13:38.818
[groans]

13:38.852 --> 13:40.129
No opioids.

13:42.131 --> 13:43.098
Thank you.

13:43.995 --> 13:45.825
You want
the itemized list?

13:48.068 --> 13:50.001
Multiple
displaced rib fractures,

13:50.036 --> 13:52.521
contusions on both lungs,
abdominal bleeding,

13:52.555 --> 13:56.663
and a fractured pancreas,
which is as painful as it gets.

13:56.697 --> 13:58.354
[gasping]

13:59.769 --> 14:02.945
Danny, you need to let me
give you pain meds,

14:02.980 --> 14:04.533
-real pain meds.
-No.

14:04.567 --> 14:07.191
I've already got you on
acetaminophen, lidocaine,

14:07.225 --> 14:09.331
gabapentin,
and magnesium.

14:09.365 --> 14:11.574
Your heart rate and BP
are still elevated.

14:11.609 --> 14:13.507
You are at risk
for a heart attack or stroke.

14:13.542 --> 14:14.819
No.

14:16.372 --> 14:18.167
I worked way too hard
getting sober.

14:20.721 --> 14:22.344
I can't go back
to square one.

14:22.378 --> 14:24.725
You need opioids.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.521
What I need...

14:29.385 --> 14:32.181
is to hear you tell me
about our dinner tonight.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.495
Please.

14:35.529 --> 14:37.186
Distract me.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.609
The restaurant is
very romantic--

14:46.644 --> 14:50.130
tablecloths and candles
everywhere.

14:50.165 --> 14:53.893
And the music isn't so loud
that it drowns out
all conversation.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.035
[groaning]

15:02.729 --> 15:03.833
The trial starts Monday.

15:03.868 --> 15:05.421
You'd only be in-patient
for three days,

15:05.456 --> 15:07.837
then weekly check-ins
for six weeks.

15:07.872 --> 15:10.081
I suppose I could hire
a dog-sitter.

15:10.116 --> 15:12.704
-[Eden fussing]
-But Lincoln doesn't
like new people.

15:12.739 --> 15:15.431
Or tall people.
Or men.

15:15.466 --> 15:17.882
Can you excuse me
for just one second?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.264
She's the sweetest girl.

15:20.298 --> 15:22.783
She prefers to face out,
be involved.

15:23.543 --> 15:24.889
Yeah. Better.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.787
I'm almost done here.

15:26.822 --> 15:29.411
I need to push my 2:00 p.m.
to 3:00 p.m.,
my 3:00 p.m. to tomorrow.

15:29.445 --> 15:31.758
So, is it three days
and two nights?

15:31.792 --> 15:33.553
-Or three days
and three nights?
-[fussing continues]

15:33.587 --> 15:34.761
Sorry.
A little more head support.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.453
No, not like that.

15:39.662 --> 15:40.905
Just...

15:40.940 --> 15:42.320
Here we go.
Right there.

15:42.355 --> 15:45.151
I need to go.
Lincoln's waiting.

15:45.185 --> 15:48.223
No. Wait. Barbara, it's--
it's two nights.

15:49.155 --> 15:50.673
[sighs]

15:57.439 --> 15:59.234
Please go talk to him.

15:59.268 --> 16:02.237
Shouldn't you be in a room
somewhere, having a baby?

16:02.271 --> 16:04.101
Congratulations,
by the way.

16:04.135 --> 16:06.551
You two cannot be
in a fight today.

16:06.586 --> 16:07.863
It's not a fight.

16:07.897 --> 16:10.417
I know it's a big deal,
but can you please
put it aside,

16:10.452 --> 16:12.074
at least for today?

16:12.109 --> 16:14.042
I got to go to the O.R.

16:14.076 --> 16:16.976
This is probably
the most important day
of Shaun's life.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.356
He needs his father.

16:19.599 --> 16:22.153
[liquid dripping]

16:22.602 --> 16:23.775
Oh, my God.

16:23.810 --> 16:24.845
Either my water
just broke,

16:24.880 --> 16:26.675
or I just peed
all over your office.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.332
Either way,
it would be a first.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.955
-[exhales sharply]
-You have plenty of time.
Here, let me help you.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.922
No, no.
I'm married
to Dr. Shaun Murphy.

16:32.957 --> 16:34.372
He has walked me
through the steps

16:34.407 --> 16:36.271
of the birthing process
many, many times.

16:36.305 --> 16:38.100
I can take it from here.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.931
Please go talk to him.

16:41.966 --> 16:43.243
I'll call janitorial.

16:43.278 --> 16:44.727
I just...

16:48.317 --> 16:51.976
Gail, always a nice surprise,
but you caught me
on a busy day.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.392
Well, sadly,
I'm about to make it busier.

16:54.427 --> 16:56.567
The board's calling
an emergency meeting
for tonight.

16:56.601 --> 16:59.570
Okay, and what is the board
defining as an emergency today?

17:00.467 --> 17:02.159
You, Marcus.

17:02.193 --> 17:04.644
And how you're going to handle
the nurses' push to unionize.

17:04.678 --> 17:06.232
I'm on top of it.

17:06.266 --> 17:07.923
That's the problem.

17:12.685 --> 17:15.310
The splenic artery embolization
went very well.

17:15.344 --> 17:18.140
Your daughter should not need
any more surgeries.

17:18.175 --> 17:19.830
[Asher] She'll need to spend
the next few days

17:19.866 --> 17:22.351
in the hospital
until we can remove
her NG tube,

17:22.386 --> 17:24.214
-get her back on regular--
-[groans]

17:24.595 --> 17:26.769
Honey? Wha--

17:28.047 --> 17:30.739
-What's happening?
-Profoundly hypotensive.

17:30.773 --> 17:33.845
-Kenny!
Pulse disparity
-between arms.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.813
This is likely
an aortic dissection.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.746
We need to get him
to an O.R., stat.

17:40.818 --> 17:43.717
[breathing shallow]
Reasonably happy
in this life...

17:43.752 --> 17:46.548
Supremely happy with You
forever in the next.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.274
-Amen.
-[monitor alarm beeps]

17:49.378 --> 17:52.554
Danny, your BP's 211 over 130,
heart rate 194.

17:52.588 --> 17:54.176
You're having
a hypertensive crisis.

17:54.211 --> 17:56.109
You need fentanyl.
The pain is killing you.

17:56.144 --> 17:59.250
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things

17:59.285 --> 18:00.838
I cannot change...

18:00.872 --> 18:04.290
[breathing shakily]

18:04.324 --> 18:06.464
He asked you
not to do that.

18:06.499 --> 18:08.432
He's not responding
to the antihypertensive drips.

18:08.466 --> 18:09.709
Right,
so up the dose.

18:09.743 --> 18:11.676
He's tachycardic
and hypertensive
because of the pain.

18:11.711 --> 18:12.781
He's going into shock.

18:12.815 --> 18:15.094
-He's not. He's praying.
-He's dying.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.372
The courage to change
the things I can...

18:17.406 --> 18:20.409
That prayer is what starts
every NA meeting.

18:20.444 --> 18:22.308
He is clinging
onto his sobriety.

18:22.342 --> 18:23.619
...and the wisdom
to know the difference.

18:23.654 --> 18:24.931
[groans]

18:26.001 --> 18:27.244
[both] And wisdom
to know the difference.

18:27.278 --> 18:28.762
He's admitting he doesn't
know what to do.

18:28.797 --> 18:29.936
He's asking God
to help him.

18:29.970 --> 18:31.662
I'm helping him.
You can leave.

18:33.629 --> 18:35.321
Accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace...

18:35.804 --> 18:36.943
[groans]

18:39.118 --> 18:40.947
Living one day
at a time...

18:40.981 --> 18:42.604
[alarm continues]

18:42.638 --> 18:45.262
Enjoying one moment
at a time...

18:45.296 --> 18:47.747
Forever in the next.
Amen.

18:56.997 --> 18:58.516
-Forgive me.
-[groans]

19:02.313 --> 19:04.143
[alarm stops, beeping resumes]

19:05.385 --> 19:09.596
Accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace.

19:09.631 --> 19:11.150
[breathing shakily]

19:32.032 --> 19:34.276
[Shaun] We need
to place the graft

19:34.311 --> 19:36.485
to replace the descending
and thoracic aorta.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.832
[Asher] We need
six more units of blood.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.800
I did a full exam
in the E.R.

19:40.834 --> 19:42.111
I mean,
the imaging was clear.

19:42.146 --> 19:43.527
There were no signs
of dissection.

19:43.561 --> 19:45.908
Trim the distal aorta.

19:45.943 --> 19:49.360
It must have started
small enough to be undetected.

19:49.395 --> 19:51.293
His blood pressure
gradually expanded the tear

19:51.328 --> 19:52.294
until it ruptured.

19:54.710 --> 19:56.505
Oh.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.197
There's a false lumen.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.508
It extends
past the carotid.

19:59.543 --> 20:01.061
The graft...

20:01.096 --> 20:02.201
won't work.

20:03.271 --> 20:05.307
[flatlines]

20:07.033 --> 20:08.966
[Asher] Well, can you...

20:09.000 --> 20:11.348
Can you have
one of your visions?

20:11.382 --> 20:13.073
Come on, Shaun.
There must be something.

20:13.108 --> 20:14.592
For his family.

20:18.044 --> 20:20.909
He's lost more than half
his blood volume.

20:22.082 --> 20:25.914
His brain has been
underperfused for too long.

20:30.677 --> 20:31.747
Time of death...

20:33.784 --> 20:35.717
4:36 p.m.

20:42.379 --> 20:44.864
You might have mentioned
you were one of the organizers

20:44.898 --> 20:47.107
behind the nurses'
unionization push.

20:48.730 --> 20:50.041
Does it matter?

20:50.076 --> 20:52.458
Not to me, but the board
feels differently.

20:53.597 --> 20:55.564
Apparently,
our relationship is why

20:55.599 --> 20:58.084
I haven't been coming down hard
on the nurses.

20:58.118 --> 20:59.706
I can personally attest
that you've been

20:59.741 --> 21:01.536
a total pain about it
the whole time.

21:01.570 --> 21:04.435
Cute.
They're threatening my job.

21:07.818 --> 21:10.303
I don't want you to
lose your job over us.

21:10.338 --> 21:12.443
I don't want to lose you
over my job.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.110
[Dr. Lim] You know,
Shaun and Lea
are having their baby today.

21:24.144 --> 21:25.629
Yes, I'm aware.

21:25.663 --> 21:27.458
[Dr. Lim] Have you
talked to him?

21:27.493 --> 21:29.288
[Dr. Glassman] I said,
"Congratulations."

21:29.322 --> 21:30.944
[Dr. Lim] Well, the alignment
looks much better,

21:30.979 --> 21:33.671
but she could have
horrible stenosis.

21:33.706 --> 21:35.570
Are you planning on
talking to him?

21:35.604 --> 21:36.950
Beyond one word?

21:36.985 --> 21:39.988
[Dr. Glassman]
I'd decompress the C1
with a laminectomy.

21:43.647 --> 21:46.166
[Dr. Lim]You know,
a crotchety, old,
wise man once told me

21:46.201 --> 21:49.446
that hanging onto my anger
was toxic.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.585
[Dr. Glassman]
I'm not "crotchety."

21:50.619 --> 21:51.689
[Dr. Lim] You were right then.

21:51.724 --> 21:53.139
And I'm right now.

21:53.173 --> 21:55.590
[Dr. Glassman
]He publicly humiliated me
yesterday,

21:55.624 --> 21:57.868
as everyone in this room
is quite well aware.

21:57.902 --> 21:59.870
[Dr. Lim] Well, he's having
his baby today.

22:01.250 --> 22:04.944
Pass me two 28-mill
pedicle screws, please.

22:04.978 --> 22:07.256
-I'll take those.
-[Dr. Glassman] Right.

22:07.291 --> 22:08.775
Old habit.

22:19.407 --> 22:21.719
I saw your family
leave a while ago.

22:22.893 --> 22:24.722
Are they getting
a hotel?

22:28.761 --> 22:30.245
You gave me fentanyl.

22:33.559 --> 22:34.525
I did.

22:36.769 --> 22:38.253
Was it
a hard decision?

22:40.428 --> 22:41.843
Overriding my wishes?

22:43.431 --> 22:45.156
Honestly?

22:45.191 --> 22:46.192
No.

22:47.607 --> 22:50.058
You were on the verge
of a heart attack.

22:50.092 --> 22:52.543
-Or brain bleed.
-Yeah, but not definitively.

22:52.578 --> 22:57.030
I wasn't willing
to risk your life
waiting for "definitively."

22:57.065 --> 23:00.033
But you were okay
sending me back
to certain opiate addiction.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.383
I couldn't...

23:06.937 --> 23:08.594
let you die.

23:33.066 --> 23:34.067
[knocks]

23:35.966 --> 23:38.693
I stopped by to offer
my nanny services.

23:38.727 --> 23:40.211
But it looks like
you're all set.

23:40.246 --> 23:42.282
I got all three participants
locked in.

23:42.317 --> 23:44.388
Trial's starting on time.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.632
Now I just need to tell Andrews
that I'm done.

23:47.633 --> 23:48.634
Done?

23:49.911 --> 23:51.084
With this job.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.262
Look,
you've had a long day.

23:56.296 --> 23:58.989
But you'll find a rhythm.
And a nanny.

23:59.955 --> 24:02.268
I can't do this job
as well as I want

24:02.302 --> 24:03.994
and take care of Eden
as well as I need.

24:05.961 --> 24:09.965
I've made the mistake of
putting my career ahead
of the people I love before.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.588
I'm not doing it again.

24:27.362 --> 24:30.399
The nurses put a chair
next to the table for you,

24:30.434 --> 24:32.194
if you would like to sit.

24:45.794 --> 24:47.589
Is it okay
to touch him?

24:47.624 --> 24:49.108
Yes.

24:49.142 --> 24:50.765
Just don't
remove the sheet.

25:08.817 --> 25:11.544
[sniffles]

25:11.579 --> 25:12.821
He was just here.

25:21.761 --> 25:23.798
How am I gonna
tell my girls?

25:30.943 --> 25:35.085
I don't think I can do
any of this without him.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.748
When my brother
Steve died,

25:44.370 --> 25:47.373
I didn't know
how I would survive.

25:49.030 --> 25:51.204
He had always
taken care of me.

25:55.208 --> 25:56.209
But I did.

25:58.384 --> 26:00.904
Because someone else
came into my life

26:00.938 --> 26:02.906
who took care of me
and loved me.

26:08.290 --> 26:09.913
Now he may be gone, too.

26:18.749 --> 26:21.959
It is very hard to lose people
you thought would never leave.

26:25.135 --> 26:26.585
But you will...

26:28.794 --> 26:32.314
be okay
because you have no choice.

26:35.145 --> 26:36.733
When we lose people
we love,

26:38.942 --> 26:41.116
we have to find a way
to keep going

26:41.151 --> 26:43.118
for the people
we still have.

26:48.399 --> 26:50.160
[cellphone chimes]

26:50.194 --> 26:51.955
Take as much time
as you need.

26:56.925 --> 26:59.169
I'm going to
have a baby now.

27:13.183 --> 27:14.840
[sighs]

27:17.532 --> 27:19.223
Oh, you're back.

27:19.258 --> 27:20.673
How's the little girl?

27:22.123 --> 27:23.918
She will be okay.

27:23.952 --> 27:25.264
Mm.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.474
How far apart are
the contractions?

27:28.508 --> 27:30.131
About two minutes.

27:31.373 --> 27:32.961
Okay.

27:32.996 --> 27:35.688
It is time
to start pushing.

27:36.137 --> 27:37.310
Are you sure?

27:37.345 --> 27:38.967
I don't--
I don't feel anything.

27:39.002 --> 27:40.313
That's because
of the epidural,

27:40.348 --> 27:42.419
but your prostaglandin E1
and E2 levels

27:42.453 --> 27:43.765
are at peak concentration

27:43.800 --> 27:46.354
for stimulating
myometrial contractility.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.839
It is time.

27:49.150 --> 27:50.220
Oh.

27:50.254 --> 27:53.154
I'll gown up
and be right back.

27:53.188 --> 27:57.158
I will refill your water bottle
and get an extra pillow.

27:57.192 --> 27:59.194
Do you want a warm
or cold washcloth?

27:59.229 --> 28:02.508
Either is fine,
but I-I need more time.

28:02.542 --> 28:04.821
Delaying delivery can cause
excessive postpartum bleeding,

28:04.855 --> 28:06.581
plus an increase
in bacterial infections.

28:08.203 --> 28:10.205
I'll get one warm
and one cold.

28:10.240 --> 28:12.691
Shaun, wait.
Come here a minute.

28:17.005 --> 28:17.972
I'm scared.

28:20.837 --> 28:22.666
Really, really scared.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.358
It is...

28:25.393 --> 28:27.360
common for women
to be anxious

28:27.395 --> 28:29.811
about
the birthing process.

28:31.261 --> 28:34.574
For nine months, my whole goal
was to keep this baby

28:34.609 --> 28:38.544
in my belly, safe
and sound and protected.

28:38.578 --> 28:42.065
And now it feels like
I'm supposed to just

28:42.099 --> 28:44.101
shove my own heart
into the world and--

28:44.136 --> 28:48.036
and let it walk around
all exposed and vulnerable

28:48.071 --> 28:50.004
and so, so tiny.

28:52.385 --> 28:57.528
And I'm not gonna be able
to protect him anymore.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.364
It will be okay.

29:08.643 --> 29:09.644
Probably.

29:14.235 --> 29:16.927
I am very excited
to meet our son.

29:18.653 --> 29:20.724
I'm really excited, too.

29:27.144 --> 29:28.145
Okay.

29:29.077 --> 29:31.562
Okay, let's--
let's do this.

29:37.154 --> 29:38.397
Okay.

29:39.467 --> 29:42.090
[sighs]

29:42.125 --> 29:43.782
You're two hours
out of surgery.
Lie down.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.714
When can I get back
to the home?

29:45.749 --> 29:47.440
I need to
take your vitals.

29:47.475 --> 29:48.579
Ehh.

29:50.305 --> 29:51.928
Want us to
call your family?

29:51.962 --> 29:54.344
I got to call Martha.

29:54.378 --> 29:56.277
-Wife? Girlfriend?
-Neither.

29:56.311 --> 29:58.106
We take walks
every morning

29:58.141 --> 30:00.971
with about 20 other old farts
from the home--

30:01.006 --> 30:04.492
all waking up to watch
the damn sunrise.

30:04.526 --> 30:06.839
Not your
preferred activity?

30:06.874 --> 30:08.910
Doc, if God wanted us
to see the sunrise,

30:08.945 --> 30:11.499
he would have put it at
a more reasonable hour.

30:14.536 --> 30:16.469
You go
because Martha's there.

30:19.403 --> 30:22.475
I think it's time
I told her...

30:22.510 --> 30:25.030
she's the reason I wake up
in the morning.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.001
Let's give her a call.

30:33.141 --> 30:34.211
Thanks.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.490
You're all right, Doc.

30:49.157 --> 30:51.056
I went through
my patient record.

30:52.436 --> 30:53.748
You made
the right call.

30:57.752 --> 30:58.857
Thank you.

31:00.237 --> 31:01.238
But...

31:03.240 --> 31:05.898
I'm going to need all the help
I can get to recover

31:05.933 --> 31:07.693
without relapsing.

31:13.423 --> 31:14.907
I...

31:14.942 --> 31:18.600
need to go back to Texas
with my family.

31:21.914 --> 31:25.469
I knew when I gave you
the drugs,

31:25.504 --> 31:26.505
I might lose you.

31:28.714 --> 31:30.750
And it wasn't
a hard decision?

31:30.785 --> 31:32.511
The decision was easy.

31:34.582 --> 31:35.894
The aftermath is...

31:42.107 --> 31:43.936
Well, I'm not going anywhere
until we have our date.

31:46.421 --> 31:48.182
Are you free tonight?

31:48.216 --> 31:51.323
[both chuckle]

31:51.357 --> 31:53.808
[screams]

31:53.842 --> 31:56.880
The levator ani muscle is
undergoing a stretch ratio

31:56.915 --> 31:59.745
-of 3.26, which is normal.
-[screams]

31:59.779 --> 32:02.127
Shaun, I need you up here,
not down there.

32:03.611 --> 32:05.199
Why isn't he coming out?

32:05.233 --> 32:06.925
[Dr. Glenn] The little guy is
just progressing slowly.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.305
I think we need a vacuum
assist to help--

32:08.340 --> 32:10.031
You want to vacuum
my baby out of me?

32:10.066 --> 32:11.101
[Shaun]
It is standard protocol

32:11.136 --> 32:13.034
if a baby is stalled
in the birth canal.

32:13.069 --> 32:14.760
I covered this in the e-mail
about instrum--

32:14.794 --> 32:16.520
There were a lot
of e-mails, Shaun.

32:16.555 --> 32:18.212
Okay.

32:18.246 --> 32:19.558
[whimpers]

32:19.592 --> 32:20.800
Is it safe
for the baby?

32:21.491 --> 32:22.975
Mm.

32:23.010 --> 32:24.252
Will he have
a cone-head?

32:26.254 --> 32:28.325
Only for approximately
48 hours.

32:29.637 --> 32:31.225
Okay, mama.
You ready?

32:31.259 --> 32:32.467
Mm-hmm.

32:32.502 --> 32:34.642
[whimpers]

32:34.676 --> 32:37.127
I am here for you.

32:37.162 --> 32:38.957
You can
squeeze my hand.

32:42.408 --> 32:45.998
[groaning]

32:46.033 --> 32:48.311
[screams]

32:55.801 --> 32:58.459
You're doing great.
He's almost here.

32:58.493 --> 33:00.012
[gasps]

33:00.047 --> 33:02.532
[baby crying]

33:05.776 --> 33:06.812
Oh!

33:08.641 --> 33:10.195
Congratulations,
Mom and Dad.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.443
Ooh.

33:17.478 --> 33:20.619
Oh, I can't believe
you're finally here, Peanut.

33:22.862 --> 33:24.726
He doesn't look like
an alien at all.

33:25.658 --> 33:29.938
His...head has
a very nice shape.

33:29.973 --> 33:32.148
Yeah.

33:32.182 --> 33:33.563
He is beautiful.

33:36.980 --> 33:39.258
Dr. Murphy, would you like
to do the honors?

33:39.293 --> 33:41.571
Yes.

33:41.605 --> 33:43.331
I would very much
like to do that.

33:48.543 --> 33:49.889
[Lea] Hi.

33:56.379 --> 33:58.036
Look at what we made.

34:01.763 --> 34:03.248
Hello.

34:03.282 --> 34:05.491
It is very nice
to meet you.

34:06.837 --> 34:08.701
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

34:12.670 --> 34:14.052
I'm your dad.

34:23.820 --> 34:27.168
You think anybody would notice
if we took this home with us?

34:27.203 --> 34:28.514
I think
you should leave it.

34:29.964 --> 34:31.552
I wasn't really going
to take it.

34:31.585 --> 34:33.588
Oh, sure you were.

34:33.623 --> 34:35.728
But...

34:35.763 --> 34:37.178
I don't think
you should resign.

34:39.629 --> 34:41.112
Because you don't have to
do it all alone.

34:46.324 --> 34:48.362
You're the reason
I wake up in the morning.

34:51.330 --> 34:52.882
So, whatever there is
to figure out,

34:52.918 --> 34:55.645
all I want in the world is
for us to do it as a family.

35:08.175 --> 35:09.521
I love you, too.

35:09.555 --> 35:10.798
[Enid fussing]

35:11.902 --> 35:13.214
She has a dirty diaper.

35:13.249 --> 35:15.665
And I have 30 lab reports
to review.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.324
[Eden fussing]

35:26.262 --> 35:28.091
[chuckles]

35:31.129 --> 35:32.475
Thank you...

35:33.993 --> 35:35.029
for saving my life.

35:36.651 --> 35:37.963
You're very welcome.

35:38.826 --> 35:41.967
I-I, um--
I didn't mean today.

35:44.038 --> 35:47.593
I meant when you made looking
for a foot in a lake fun.

35:49.008 --> 35:52.288
When you sat next to me
in church, quietly,

35:52.322 --> 35:54.013
knowing that was
exactly what I needed.

35:56.015 --> 35:59.329
And, uh,
when you trusted me...

36:01.159 --> 36:03.195
even though I'm pretty sure
I didn't deserve it.

36:05.542 --> 36:07.820
And, of course, today.

36:11.686 --> 36:13.792
You make me believe
that I can do this.

36:22.387 --> 36:24.043
You will be okay.

36:32.845 --> 36:34.502
I'm gonna miss you.

36:50.104 --> 36:51.554
Thank you.

36:54.729 --> 36:56.352
I love a sunset
as much as anyone,

36:56.386 --> 36:59.320
but isn't this
a little sentiment
over science?

36:59.355 --> 37:01.874
There's a case study
out of Alabama--

37:01.909 --> 37:04.256
internal decapitation.

37:04.291 --> 37:06.569
They took the patient out
every night--

37:06.603 --> 37:09.606
sunset, beautiful sky,
and fresh air

37:09.641 --> 37:11.539
to help
stimulate the brain.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.612
How long before they got
a response?

37:15.647 --> 37:18.477
A couple days,
but it worked.

37:18.512 --> 37:22.101
Hey, how can you argue
with a thing
called "Operation Sunset"?

37:26.313 --> 37:28.729
Your family is coming.

37:28.763 --> 37:33.043
I know they'd love to see
you smile, or even a blink.

37:35.494 --> 37:36.875
Or you could just
flip us off
