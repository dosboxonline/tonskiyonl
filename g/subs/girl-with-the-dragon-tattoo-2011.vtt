WEBVTT

00:30.698 --> 00:33.157
-What kind is it?
-l don't know.

00:33.325 --> 00:34.492
White?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.327
And the frame?

00:36.495 --> 00:39.247
-Dark.
-Postmark?

00:39.415 --> 00:41.499
Same as last time.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.668
And no note.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.253
No.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.589
I'm so sorry, Henrik.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.954
Will you appeal?

03:25.122 --> 03:27.415
What is this?
The media event of the year?

03:27.583 --> 03:29.917
Don't try to play it down, Mikael.
lt won't work.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.378
Don't try to play it up.
That won't work either.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.922
Mikael, can we get a quote?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.842
Mikael, will you appeal?

03:38.176 --> 03:40.303
Yes. l'll appeal to you, Viggo.

03:41.597 --> 03:44.390
Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist
was able to play the victim...

03:44.558 --> 03:46.976
...the brave journalist going up
against the bad guy.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.604
I don't know why malicious intent
couldn't be proven.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.899
-When you call a guy a criminal--
-lf you want to say these things--

03:53.066 --> 03:54.817
Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.904
There's really no greater disgrace
for a journalist than libel.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.240
--was found guilty today on 16 counts
of aggravated libel.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.994
Can l get that sandwich there?
And a black coffee.

04:05.162 --> 04:08.080
ln an article published earlier
this year, Blomkvist claimed...

04:08.248 --> 04:11.459
...Wennerström, founder and president
of the Wennerström Group...

04:11.627 --> 04:15.296
...used state funds intended
for industrial development in Poland...

04:15.464 --> 04:18.382
...in an arms deal with the right-wing
Ustaše in Croatia.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.510
l have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist.
He's a fine journalist...

04:21.678 --> 04:23.971
...who l don't believe
is guided by malice.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.182
But what he wrote was inaccurate.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.976
And inaccuracies
can't go unanswered.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.438
All journalists have to accept,
like the rest of us...

04:32.606 --> 04:35.650
...actions have consequences.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.526
Blomkvist was ordered to pay...

04:37.694 --> 04:40.321
...600,000 Swedish kronor
in damages and all court costs.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.866
Can l get a packet of Marlboro Red
and a lighter?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.023
Yeah.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.660
-Where have you been?
-Walking. Thinking.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.370
-Smoking?
-Yeah. Just one.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.546
TV4 called.
l told them no statement...

05:38.714 --> 05:40.965
...until we've read
the judgment in its entirety.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.384
Well, l have. Anyone else?

05:43.552 --> 05:45.428
Everyone who wants
to see you humiliated.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.055
-Been on the phone all morning?
-l'm as much to blame.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.474
-You are? You wrote it?
-l read it. l ran it.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.810
-Not the same.
-Our credibility isn't dead yet.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.603
Mine is.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.066
l'm tired.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.903
l'm gonna go home,
crawl under the duvet for a week.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.785
l'll call Greger,
tell him l'm not coming home.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.203
Thank you.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.043
lt's possible we could wait forever.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.963
-You called her and spoke to her?
-l'm afraid that doesn't mean much.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.845
No one here particularly likes her.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.347
l find it's much better
if she works from home.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.225
But you told her
l wanted to meet with her.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.062
l've told her many times
l prefer her not to meet clients.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.398
-You like her?
-Very much.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.818
She's one of the best investigators
l have, as you saw from her report.

06:42.986 --> 06:46.739
-But?
-l'm concerned you won't like her.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.950
-She's different.
-ln what way?

06:51.036 --> 06:52.078
ln every way.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.127
Miss Salander is here.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.510
Lisbeth.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.929
Mr. Dirch Frode.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.931
How do you do?

07:23.235 --> 07:24.819
Something wrong with the report?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.570
No, it was quite thorough.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.657
But l'm also interested
in what's not in it.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.827
-There's nothing not in it.
-Your opinion of him isn't.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.831
-l'm not paid to give my opinion.
-So you don't have one?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.961
He's clean, in my opinion.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.672
You mean he's hygienic?

07:45.132 --> 07:48.843
He's who he presents himself to be.
ln his business, that's an asset.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.138
Well, there's less in his asset column
after his conviction today.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.140
True. He made a fool of himself.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.808
lf it happened that way.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.977
Are you suggesting
that he was set up?

07:58.937 --> 08:00.729
That was never part
of my assignment.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.606
But you're right.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.317
He did make a fool of himself
professionally.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.821
How much of a fool did he make
of himself financially?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.699
The judgment will just about
empty his savings.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.033
-May l go?
-Moment.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.370
Your report is light in another area.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.247
His personal life.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.249
Anything you chose not to disclose?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.043
Nothing that warranted inclusion.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.920
Does that mean yes or no?

08:25.088 --> 08:29.216
l think what Miss Salander means, and
l agree, is that everyone has a right...

08:29.384 --> 08:32.678
...to a certain amount of privacy,
even if they're being investigated.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.389
Not in this case.
l need to know anything about him...

08:35.557 --> 08:39.143
...l might find unsavory,
even if she doesn't.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.982
He's had a longstanding
sexual relationship...

08:45.150 --> 08:49.236
...with his co-editor of the magazine.
lt wrecked his marriage but not hers.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.655
Sometimes he performs cunnilingus.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.158
Not often enough, in my opinion.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.952
No, you're right not to include that.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.495
l know.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.513
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.

09:57.681 --> 09:58.973
-She offered.
-He declined.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.683
-As she hoped.
-Never a good idea.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.310
-Mixing family and business.
-l would've lost anyway.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.981
lt wasn't about Mikael. lt was about
Wennerström sending a message...

10:07.148 --> 10:10.317
...to the press and the FSA,
saying, "Don't ask questions."

10:10.568 --> 10:11.610
Cheer up.

10:15.782 --> 10:16.824
Dad.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.535
Nilla, you don't have
to worry about me.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.495
-Mom's worried.
-About me?

10:22.414 --> 10:23.664
About the money.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.731
Good evening.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.236
Nilla? What are you doing?

11:36.404 --> 11:37.529
Nothing.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.864
Are you serious?

11:39.032 --> 11:42.618
l don't wanna talk about it
since l know you won't approve.

11:42.786 --> 11:43.869
Of...?

11:44.412 --> 11:45.704
-Nilla.
-Light of Life.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.247
Light of what?

11:56.383 --> 11:57.674
-Hello?
-Herr Blomkvist.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.927
-Yeah.
-Forgive me for intruding on Christmas.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.470
My name is Dirch Frode.

12:01.638 --> 12:05.599
l'm an attorney. l represent Henrik
Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of him?

12:05.767 --> 12:06.892
Yeah, of course l have.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.478
He'd love to talk to you
about a private matter.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.689
This is an awkward moment.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.943
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm about to sit down
to a Christmas dinner myself.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.195
No, that's not exactly what l meant.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.739
You're referring
to your recent legal problems.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.783
That has provided us
with much amusement.

12:22.951 --> 12:23.992
l'm sorry?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.703
Herr Vanger has little love
for Herr Wennerström either.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.456
-Have him call me.
-But he would love to speak to you...

12:29.624 --> 12:32.209
...in person, if possible. Up north.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.378
-ln Hedestad.
-That's not gonna be possible.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.381
Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old
to go to Stockholm. Please.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.758
Be so kind as to consider.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.719
Hedestad is lovely in the winter.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.932
l'll call you back on this number.
Okay?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.948
Usually when l wake up in a cold bed
it's at home.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.867
-l'm sorry.
-What are you doing?

13:05.034 --> 13:08.036
-l'm writing a press release.
-Saying?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.709
You're taking over as publisher,
you're very sorry...

13:13.877 --> 13:16.170
...for any nuisance
Mr. Wennerström was caused...

13:16.337 --> 13:19.339
-...and l can't be reached for comment.
-Are you giving up?

13:19.507 --> 13:20.799
Stepping aside.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.885
This makes me sick.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.507
-First time in Hedestad?
-And the last.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.051
Oh, don't say that.
lt's lovely in the spring.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.970
You said it would be lovely
in the winter.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.097
Well, this is unseasonable.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.808
Well, l'll be on the 4:30 train
back to Stockholm.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.227
Unless we get snowed in.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.270
l'm joking.

14:15.438 --> 14:18.315
You'll be home tonight,
if that's what you wish.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.273
Welcome.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.524
Come inside.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.110
lt's warm.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.736
How do you do?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.661
So...

15:13.955 --> 15:15.372
...what do you know about me?

15:15.957 --> 15:19.042
You used to run one of the largest
industrial firms in the country.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.628
-"Used to." That's correct.
-Oh, l didn't mean that.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.589
-Should l stay?
-No.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.342
My grandfather forged the tracks...

15:27.510 --> 15:29.678
...that the 4:30 train
will take you home on.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.264
We stitched this country together.

15:32.432 --> 15:37.144
We made the steel, milled the lumber
that built modern Sweden.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.564
And what do you think
our most profitable product now is?

15:40.732 --> 15:41.982
Fertilizer.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.901
l'm not obsessed by
the declining health of the company.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.696
But l am with
the settling of accounts.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.198
And the clock is ticking.
l need your help.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.783
l'm-- Doing what?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.411
Officially, assisting
with my memoirs.

15:54.621 --> 15:59.166
But what you'll really be doing...

15:59.334 --> 16:03.378
...is solving a mystery
by doing what you do so well.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.964
Your recent legal mishap
notwithstanding.

16:06.132 --> 16:10.510
You will be investigating thieves,
misers, bullies...

16:10.678 --> 16:16.183
...the most detestable collection
of people that you will ever meet.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.893
My family.

16:25.026 --> 16:28.278
Would you like to sit? l could possibly
clear a place if necessary.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.614
-Did you make it?
-Have you something for me?

16:34.160 --> 16:38.538
l am on welfare, l do not administer it.
This is not enough.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.218
No, thank you.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.597
This is Harriet.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.018
The granddaughter
of my brother Richard.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.563
Richard was a Nazi
of the first order...

17:03.898 --> 17:09.194
...joining the Nationalist Socialist
Freedom League when he was 17.

17:09.362 --> 17:13.949
lsn't it interesting how fascists
always steal the word "freedom"?

17:16.828 --> 17:19.830
Oh, the 4:30. Yes, l know. Okay.

17:19.997 --> 17:24.835
Anyway, Richard died a martyr
to the Nazi cause in 1940.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.629
Missed all the real excitement.

17:28.005 --> 17:32.134
But not the opportunity to regularly
beat his wife, Margareta...

17:32.301 --> 17:34.052
...and their son, Gottfried.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.929
Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father...

17:36.097 --> 17:38.807
...was what they used to call
a good-time Charlie.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.601
-They still call them that.
-Do they? Okay.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.146
He was a charmer,
a ladies' man and a drunk.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.274
ln other words, a born salesman.
Which he did for the company...

17:47.442 --> 17:50.152
...traveling around
and taking clients out to dinner.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.654
-Well, somebody's gotta do it.
-That's right.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.824
Anyway, he died in 1965.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.993
Drowned, drunk, here on the island.

17:58.161 --> 18:02.581
His wife, lsabella, who had been pretty
much useless as a parent before...

18:02.749 --> 18:05.125
...became even more so
after his death...

18:05.293 --> 18:07.961
...which is when l began
looking after the children.

18:08.129 --> 18:11.131
Martin, who runs Vanger lndustries,
now that l'm retired.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.924
That's right, l Googled him.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.259
And Harriet.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.431
She was bright, curious...

18:19.974 --> 18:22.893
...a winning combination
in any person.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.480
-And beautiful.
-Yeah.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.691
Something happened to her?

18:29.859 --> 18:32.068
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet...

18:32.779 --> 18:34.738
...and for the past 40 years...

18:34.906 --> 18:37.991
...has been trying
to drive me insane.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.454
lt was September 24th, 1966.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.414
A Saturday.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.291
Harriet was 16.

18:46.501 --> 18:47.584
My brothers...

18:47.752 --> 18:50.420
...and their wives and their children
and grandchildren...

18:50.588 --> 18:51.880
...were all gathered here...

18:52.048 --> 18:55.091
...for our loathsome annual
board meeting and dinner.

18:55.259 --> 18:59.304
It was also the day the yacht club
held their autumn parade.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.641
Harriet, with one or two school
friends, went into town to see it.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.894
She returned a little after 2:00.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.940
She came into the parlor.
She asked if she could talk to me.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.359
l honestly don't remember
what l was doing...

19:12.527 --> 19:14.402
...that l thought
was more important...

19:14.570 --> 19:17.030
...but I told her
to give me a few minutes.

19:18.741 --> 19:23.578
lt was during those few minutes
that something else occurred.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.793
The accident had nothing to do
with Harriet...

19:29.961 --> 19:31.086
...and yet everything.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.298
It was chaos as everybody
put down what they were doing.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.801
Police, ambulance, fire brigade...

19:37.969 --> 19:41.888
...reporters, photographers, onlookers
all quickly arrived from town...

19:42.056 --> 19:46.560
...just as we on the island, the family,
hurried to the bridge from our side.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.144
The driver of the car...

19:48.312 --> 19:49.896
...a man named Aronsson...

19:50.064 --> 19:52.399
...was pinned and severely injured.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.485
We tried desperately
to pry him loose with our hands...

19:55.653 --> 19:58.029
...since metal tools might spark.

19:58.948 --> 20:03.159
lt was an hour after the crash
that Harriet was in the kitchen.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.453
Anna herself saw her.

20:09.584 --> 20:14.462
Well, we finally got poor Aronsson
out of his car and off to the hospital.

20:15.006 --> 20:18.174
Just as we from our side...

20:18.342 --> 20:21.344
...slowly drifted back to the house.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.557
The sun was down,
the excitement over.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.059
We sat down to dinner.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.853
lt was then that l noticed...

20:30.354 --> 20:31.813
...Harriet wasn't there.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.983
And she wasn't there
the next morning.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.943
Or the next.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.070
Or the next 40 years.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.534
What was she going to tell me?

20:44.702 --> 20:47.954
Why didn't l make time for her?
Why didn't l listen?

20:48.122 --> 20:51.499
-And she couldn't have just run away?
-No. Not without being seen.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.335
The firemen stayed out all night...

20:53.502 --> 20:55.462
...on the bridge
pumping up gasoline.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.465
No one swam across
or took a boat.

20:58.633 --> 21:01.343
All the boats were still tied up
on this side Sunday.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.137
Believe me, l checked.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.099
She couldn't have just fallen
and drowned?

21:08.267 --> 21:13.021
No. The currents aren't strong here.
Anything that falls in the water turns up.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.481
Like her father.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.025
His body didn't drift
more than 10 meters...

21:17.193 --> 21:19.611
...when he drowned the year before.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.906
Oh, no. Someone killed her.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.700
Someone on the island that day.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.869
Someone close enough to know...

21:28.037 --> 21:32.457
...what she used to give me
each year on my birthday.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.544
Those are from her.

21:37.046 --> 21:40.507
And the rest, from her killer.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.688
Who knows about these?

21:54.855 --> 21:58.358
There's me, the police, the killer...

21:58.734 --> 21:59.776
...and now you.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.246
After the police investigation
evaporated...

22:11.414 --> 22:14.207
...l kept at it, studying
all the information there was.

22:14.709 --> 22:18.586
l have spent half my life
examining the events of a single day.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.922
l understand your frustration...

22:21.090 --> 22:23.925
...but what you're asking me to do,
it's a waste of money.

22:24.093 --> 22:27.220
-But we haven't discussed your fee.
-We don't need to.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.847
Thank you.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.642
l can't find something
you've been unable to find in 40 years.

22:32.810 --> 22:36.646
You don't know that. You have
a very keen investigative mind.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.732
Here's what l propose:

22:38.899 --> 22:40.650
You come stay on the island.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.029
l have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.114
You study the material l send you.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.533
You find something l've missed
or you don't.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.786
What you're asking me to do
is set aside my life and career for--

22:51.954 --> 22:53.997
Think of this
as a well-deserved holiday.

22:54.165 --> 22:58.710
A way of avoiding all those people
that you might want to avoid right now.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.421
As for compensation,
l'll pay you double your salary...

23:01.589 --> 23:03.298
...for as many months as it takes.

23:03.466 --> 23:06.259
-Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
-Herr Vanger--

23:06.427 --> 23:08.595
l'm not done.
l will throw in one more thing...

23:08.763 --> 23:10.930
...even though
you're a terrible negotiator.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.683
lt's something you want
more than anything else...

23:13.851 --> 23:17.312
...and it can't be bought at any price.
So let me give it to you.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.899
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.110
He began his career
working for me...

23:24.278 --> 23:27.947
...and l have followed it with interest,
shall we say, ever since.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.368
You were right about him.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.371
You just couldn't prove it.

24:05.945 --> 24:09.364
We're in the middle of the worst crisis
ever, and you're writing a memoir.

24:09.532 --> 24:13.201
-You fired me. l need something to do.
-You fired you.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.413
l need you here, not the North Pole.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.999
Mikael, you know
what this is going to look like.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.252
Like l've been gutted.
l'm running away. l am.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.296
Wennerström wants to see me
wave a white flag, not a red flag.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.633
lf it looks like there's a problem
between us, it'll satisfy him.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.176
There is a problem between us.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.929
He won't be satisfied
until he shuts us down.

24:33.556 --> 24:37.559
-You're leaving me to fight him alone.
-lt's four hours by train.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.941
lt's not the North Pole.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.151
Hey, hey.

26:25.542 --> 26:42.809
Network busy.
Please try again later.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.483
What?

26:50.943 --> 26:52.151
Some milk?

27:11.171 --> 27:14.549
Network busy.
Please try again later.

27:16.510 --> 27:19.095
Oh, yeah. These as well.

27:56.759 --> 28:00.053
-You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
-His ward. He doesn't have a daughter.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.431
Please.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.518
He's had severe
cerebral hemorrhaging...

28:07.686 --> 28:11.230
...either from the fall itself
or from a stroke that led to the fall.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.316
His blood pressure is still high.

28:13.484 --> 28:16.486
l'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness,
but that's not assured.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.946
And it's possible, even if he does...

28:19.114 --> 28:21.908
...that there will be
neurological damage.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.181
Oh, jeez.

28:50.521 --> 28:52.271
Hi. l'm Gunnar.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.440
The caretaker.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.943
-Oh, hey, Gunnar. Come in.
-Okay.

29:01.532 --> 29:04.158
-You want to put it in there?
-Okay.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.960
You're an author.

29:14.128 --> 29:18.214
Well, l'm doing a biography
of Herr Vanger.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.302
-l saw you on television.
-That's unfortunate.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.263
Bit of trouble, l guess.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.766
-No jail time though. That's good.
-No.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.936
Cost you a lot of money
though, yeah?

29:33.897 --> 29:35.273
There.

29:38.444 --> 29:42.989
The entire island
is owned by my family.

29:44.575 --> 29:49.704
Your closest neighbor
is my brother Harald...

29:50.581 --> 29:52.915
...another Nazi, if you can believe.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.625
Two in the family.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.963
Oh, yes, he's quite detestable,
to put it nicely.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.550
But you'll probably never see him.
He's a recluse.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.511
-He was there that day?
-lndeed, he was.

30:05.679 --> 30:09.140
His daughter, Cecilia,
lives over there.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.017
They don't speak.

30:11.185 --> 30:13.769
Does anybody speak
to anybody on this island?

30:13.937 --> 30:16.606
Actually, lsabella, Harriet's mother,
who lives there...

30:16.773 --> 30:20.651
...she speaks to Harald, which is one
of the reasons l don't speak to her.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.903
Right.

30:22.070 --> 30:25.281
Cecilia's brother, Birger,
lives over there.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.074
Who doesn't he speak to?

30:27.242 --> 30:28.367
You, probably.

30:28.535 --> 30:32.038
But you wouldn't want him to. He can
be just as unpleasant as Harald.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.998
Quickly losing track
of who's who here.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.168
How you'll wish it were always so.

30:37.336 --> 30:41.297
Soon you will know us all
only too well. With my apologies.

30:41.548 --> 30:46.636
Now, out there, my grandnephew
Martin's house, Harriet's brother.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.514
-Who speaks to him?
-l speak to him.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.725
He runs the company now,
as l think l told you.

30:54.603 --> 30:57.605
Someone's shooting his dinner.
Gunnar, probably.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.106
Oh, yes, l met him earlier.

30:59.274 --> 31:02.860
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.

31:03.487 --> 31:05.196
Well, he lives over there.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.866
-And you live there.
-Sorry?

31:09.034 --> 31:10.576
Your house.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.997
Oh, yes.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.250
Yes, you're right.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.085
The man who hires the detective...

31:19.253 --> 31:22.547
...should always be kept
on the suspects list.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.809
Her mother.

32:45.589 --> 32:47.965
But what about the search? Please.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.011
Please. l beg you.

33:23.293 --> 33:26.796
The fact that l never found a body
was not surprising.

33:26.963 --> 33:29.882
You can't dig up an entire island.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.344
But neither could l find the motive.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.180
Was it spontaneous?
Was it calculated?

33:36.348 --> 33:38.724
Did she know something
someone wished she didn't?

33:38.892 --> 33:42.436
-Was it about business?
-Business? Well, she was 16.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.355
And very bright.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.233
Henrik told me and many others
he could easily see her...

33:47.401 --> 33:49.068
...running the company one day.

33:49.653 --> 33:52.321
She was with some friends
that day at a parade.

33:52.489 --> 33:56.200
She told them she was feeling unwell.
She left early.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.870
But they also told me
she kept secrets from them too.

34:00.205 --> 34:03.624
The main thing l learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.085
-l have one.
-Then you know.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.337
l wanted to...

34:09.631 --> 34:11.424
...ask you about this.

34:14.136 --> 34:16.721
She received that from Henrik
the Christmas before.

34:19.182 --> 34:22.143
l've studied it more times
than l can say.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.895
l know every page of it.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.398
-lt's the last page l was curious about.
-As was l.

34:27.566 --> 34:31.485
lt's a list of names, numbers
and it must have some significance.

34:31.653 --> 34:33.112
All local phone numbers.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.573
The first belonged
to a woman, Margot...

34:35.741 --> 34:38.659
...whose mother was Magda,
who denied knowing Harriet.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.871
The fourth, R.L.,
belonged to Rosmarie Larsson...

34:42.038 --> 34:45.916
...an elderly woman who died
some years before.

34:46.084 --> 34:50.463
The other three were not connected
in any way that l could find.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.300
l reminded you of things
you'd rather forget, and l'm sorry.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.510
l can't forget.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.638
lt's my Rebecka case.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.891
l don't know what that is.

35:02.559 --> 35:07.271
Every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.483
Back then we had an
Officer Torstensson.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.527
Year after year, he kept
going back to this Rebecka case.

35:13.695 --> 35:16.947
Taking out the files,
studying them over and over.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.158
We were young.
We laughed at him.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.285
And that was also
a missing-girl case?

35:21.453 --> 35:24.205
No, no, no,
that's not why l mention it.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.291
l'm talking about
the soul of a policeman.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.711
Poor old Torstensson
never solved it.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.255
And he never let it go.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.348
So how's Mr. Palmgren doing?

35:42.849 --> 35:45.684
l heard he had a stroke
of some kind?

35:45.852 --> 35:46.894
lt's terrible.

35:48.188 --> 35:51.106
Now, what exactly do you do
at this security company?

35:51.274 --> 35:53.025
Make coffee, sort mail.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.860
But not full-time.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.071
Not even part-time consistently.

35:57.239 --> 36:02.201
They somehow got along without
coffee or mail in July and August?

36:06.873 --> 36:09.041
-How much do you make there?
-Enough.

36:10.794 --> 36:11.877
How much is your rent?

36:12.045 --> 36:13.546
l pay my rent.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.051
And when was the last time
you were late?

36:19.219 --> 36:20.261
Never.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.974
You think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive?

36:27.310 --> 36:28.394
Here's the problem.

36:30.105 --> 36:33.065
There's a discrepancy
between the obligation...

36:33.233 --> 36:37.361
...of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship
and the management of your finances.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.739
There's no discrepancy. lt was clear
l could manage my own finances.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.074
That is not clear to me.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.410
-l'm not a child.
-You are not. But you were.

36:44.578 --> 36:46.745
And between then and now,
you were committed...

36:46.913 --> 36:49.748
...to the locked ward of St. Stefan's
where you continued...

36:49.916 --> 36:52.042
...to display violent aggression.

36:52.752 --> 36:55.421
And you failed to adapt
to four foster homes...

36:55.589 --> 36:58.924
...were arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics...

36:59.092 --> 37:03.137
...again for assault,
smashing a bottle into a man's face.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.598
And it's not even that long ago.

37:05.765 --> 37:10.102
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren
into thinking that you have changed...

37:10.270 --> 37:12.104
...but when l'm looking at this...

37:12.272 --> 37:16.233
...not to mention the way
you're looking at me now...

37:16.401 --> 37:18.193
...l don't think you have.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.322
So the good old
Mr. Palmgren days are over.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.491
Starting now, you will be given
a monthly allowance.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.952
You'll provide me with receipts
for your expenses.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.331
lf the numbers don't balance, l assume
the difference is going to drugs.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.374
l've taken care of myself
since l was 10.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.001
The state has taken care of you.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.879
Miss Salander, please, look at me,
this is important.

37:37.047 --> 37:40.382
Since your behavior
is elaborately documented in here...

37:40.592 --> 37:43.135
...it will shock no one
if l chose an alternative...

37:43.303 --> 37:46.680
...to the very lenient arrangement
l have just outlined.

37:49.142 --> 37:53.312
Would you prefer
institutionalization?

38:14.250 --> 38:15.334
-Mikael?
-Yes.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.086
-l'm Liv.
-Oh, hi.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.879
We're going to the same place.
Hop in.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.422
Oh, good, thank you.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.892
l found him at death's door,
halfway up the hill.

38:32.060 --> 38:35.020
-l'm afraid l'm a little out of shape.
-lt's a climb for anyone.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.606
-l should've warned you. Come in.
-Thank you, Martin.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.775
Henrik says great things about you.

38:39.943 --> 38:43.946
-No, no. Leave your shoes on.
-Martin? Smells wonderful.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.032
-What are we drinking?
-What a place. Look at that view.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.869
l used to work in the company's
petrochemical division in Göteborg.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.579
When it was sold, l went with it.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.039
A dark day.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.626
l live in Hong Kong, but come back
to Stockholm for family events.

38:57.794 --> 39:00.212
And l drive up to spend
a couple of days with Martin.

39:00.380 --> 39:04.216
-lt's just the moose steak she wants.
-Who can blame her? lt's wonderful.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.096
Something's left open.
Do you like this wine...

39:09.264 --> 39:13.058
-...or you want to try something else?
-No, no, it's fine.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.565
You're writing a book now,
Martin said.

39:19.733 --> 39:22.359
-Henrik's biography.
-l love Henrik. He's fascinating.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.819
Martin too.

39:23.987 --> 39:27.197
Together they are the old Sweden
and the new.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.615
Yes, they are.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.745
You know about Harriet, right?

39:33.621 --> 39:35.456
-You don't?
-Yes, l do.

39:36.583 --> 39:40.419
The family doesn't want to talk about it,
but it can't be swept under the rug.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.504
-What can't?
-Harriet.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.757
We can talk about it later.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.092
We can talk about it now.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.511
Liv knows everything
about my crazy family.

39:49.679 --> 39:52.139
-That's why she'll never marry me.
-That's one reason.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.308
l don't want to read
about that in the book.

39:54.476 --> 39:56.769
Everything else is fine.
Harriet certainly.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.814
You know,
everything changed after that.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.317
Not just the family
but the company as well.

40:03.485 --> 40:05.569
-How so?
-We're not Ericsson or Nordea.

40:05.737 --> 40:09.239
But we're still the largest
family-owned company in the country.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.617
At our height we had
40,000 employees.

40:11.785 --> 40:13.035
We have half of that now.

40:13.203 --> 40:17.122
And that downward slide
began after my sister's death.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.962
lt broke Henrik's
entrepreneurial spirit...

40:24.339 --> 40:25.380
...and his heart.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.967
-You were here that day?
-l came in later...

40:29.135 --> 40:31.887
...after the accident on the bridge,
with the 4:30 train.

40:32.055 --> 40:35.015
-l know it well.
-A terrible day.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.769
And the days after, you know?

40:38.937 --> 40:43.190
Searching, not finding. Even worse.

40:44.067 --> 40:47.986
This event, Mikael, it has to have
a big part in your book.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.303
l got a call from social welfare.

41:14.055 --> 41:16.306
l've been assigned a new guardian.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.746
-Hi.
-Hello.

42:20.914 --> 42:23.373
l thought l'd come over
and say hello.

42:23.541 --> 42:27.085
-l'm Cecilia.
-Oh, yes. Please, come in.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.424
Can l get you some coffee?

42:32.592 --> 42:34.885
No, thank you.

42:44.270 --> 42:48.857
We are all uncomfortable with the idea
of a chronicle of our family.

42:49.025 --> 42:51.818
lt's not about the family.
lt's about Henrik and the company.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.195
Like l said.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.783
lt's not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone.

42:57.951 --> 42:59.576
Unlike the one
that landed you in court.

42:59.744 --> 43:02.955
Unlike that one, yes.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.458
So you're not really here to find out
what happened to Harriet.

43:06.626 --> 43:10.462
l can't ignore such a dramatic event,
but, no, that's by no means my focus.

43:10.630 --> 43:12.589
Those boxes that Gunnar
carted down here...

43:12.757 --> 43:17.135
...which are where, in the closet now?
Those weren't Henrik's investigation?

43:17.470 --> 43:21.431
l wonder sometimes who's crazier,
my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.643
Since we're talking about her...

43:24.811 --> 43:26.979
...since you brought her up,
what was she like?

43:27.146 --> 43:28.313
What was Harriet like?

43:28.481 --> 43:31.149
-l'm sure Henrik has told you.
-He was my age back then.

43:31.317 --> 43:34.486
He couldn't know what was
really going on with a teenager.

43:34.654 --> 43:35.821
You were the same age.

43:35.989 --> 43:37.906
My sister Anita
was closer to her in age.

43:38.074 --> 43:40.826
She knew Harriet better than anyone.
You should talk to her.

43:40.994 --> 43:43.662
-l'd love to. Where is she?
-lf l had to guess, London.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.164
You don't know
where your sister lives?

43:46.332 --> 43:49.501
l haven't seen her in years.
We never really got along.

43:49.669 --> 43:53.171
-l'm getting used to that comment.
-She hates this place more than l do.

43:53.339 --> 43:56.174
She left.
Moved to London, that was it.

43:56.467 --> 43:59.386
You couldn't pay her to send
a Christmas card, much less visit.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.346
l'll track her down for you.

44:01.514 --> 44:04.683
lf you do, and try talking
to her about us...

44:04.851 --> 44:08.020
...don't be surprised
if she tells you to fuck off.

44:14.694 --> 44:16.695
You're backed up, aren't you?

44:18.489 --> 44:19.698
Hard drive at home, yeah.

44:19.866 --> 44:22.701
Okay. That's good,
because this one's done.

44:27.915 --> 44:30.792
Have you ever had any
sexually transmitted diseases?

44:34.547 --> 44:38.342
And when was the last time
that you were tested for HlV?

44:40.595 --> 44:42.888
How many partners have you had
in the last month?

44:44.390 --> 44:46.725
And how many of those were men?

44:50.229 --> 44:53.273
lt's regulation, l have to ask
these things. lt's a health matter.

44:53.441 --> 44:54.566
Write what you want.

44:54.734 --> 44:57.110
And why do you need
such an expensive computer?

44:57.278 --> 44:59.571
-For work.
-Making coffee, sorting mail.

44:59.739 --> 45:02.699
-l should have control of my money.
-And you will.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.577
Once you learn to be sociable,
get along with people.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.537
Can you do that?

45:09.957 --> 45:14.169
Why don't we start
with that now, huh?

45:16.130 --> 45:19.883
Why don't we start with me?

45:26.557 --> 45:29.559
You do something for me,
l do something for you.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.771
That's what normal people do.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.955
l want you to have that computer.

46:06.889 --> 46:08.265
Feel that.

46:09.183 --> 46:10.809
That's gabardine.

46:17.233 --> 46:18.984
Unzip it.

46:27.702 --> 46:32.581
And....

46:46.179 --> 46:48.138
l like the reticence.

46:49.849 --> 46:51.349
lt's almost convincing.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.654
Anita Vanger.

48:27.822 --> 48:30.448
-Through there.
-Thank you.

48:32.785 --> 48:33.827
Excuse me.

48:34.537 --> 48:36.496
l probably should have made
an appointment.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.332
No, it's fine.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.793
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

48:41.961 --> 48:44.963
-Mikael.
-Mikael. How do you do?

48:45.131 --> 48:46.631
How do you do?

48:46.799 --> 48:49.301
So you're looking
for investment counseling?

48:49.468 --> 48:51.303
Well, l would be if l had any money.

48:51.804 --> 48:53.305
l'm sorry, l don't understand.

48:53.973 --> 48:59.519
l'm writing a biography of your
Uncle Henrik. That's why l'm here.

48:59.895 --> 49:02.063
l haven't seen him in over 20 years.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.524
Actually it's a lot more than that.

49:04.692 --> 49:07.694
Haven't seen my sister,
haven't seen anyone in that family.

49:07.862 --> 49:11.031
Most of what l'm writing about
predates that...

49:11.198 --> 49:13.158
...so your recollections are valid.

49:13.326 --> 49:16.202
l wouldn't know where to start,
if that was a question.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.331
Well, then let me narrow it down.
l've gotten up to the 1960s...

49:19.498 --> 49:23.084
...to the event that, you know,
changed everything in Henrik's life.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.669
Harriet.

49:27.214 --> 49:31.885
Everything that l know about that
l told to whatever his name was.

49:32.053 --> 49:33.136
Morell.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.180
My recollections
were a lot better then.

49:35.348 --> 49:38.391
l'm not really speaking
about the event itself.

49:38.559 --> 49:41.853
l just want to get a clearer sense
of what Harriet was like.

49:42.855 --> 49:46.066
She was very messed up.

49:47.860 --> 49:51.071
Well, just like all us Vanger kids,
really, but....

49:51.238 --> 49:53.365
Crazy mother.

49:53.532 --> 49:55.450
Drunken father.

49:55.618 --> 49:57.202
At least her father wasn't a Nazi.

49:57.370 --> 49:59.079
-Was he abusive?
-Mine?

49:59.246 --> 50:00.622
No, hers.

50:00.790 --> 50:05.460
Not that l ever saw, but you could tell
that something was going on.

50:06.921 --> 50:10.882
Some days
she'd be very withdrawn.

50:11.050 --> 50:13.885
And then the next minute
she'd be putting on makeup...

50:14.053 --> 50:17.847
...and wearing the tightest sweater
that she had to school.

50:18.015 --> 50:21.434
And then she'd be studying
her Bible like a nun.

50:21.602 --> 50:24.938
No Vanger was ever religious.
Can you imagine?

50:25.106 --> 50:27.732
She was obviously very unhappy.

50:29.235 --> 50:32.737
-What do you think happened to her?
-Everyone knows what.

50:33.280 --> 50:36.241
You don't have any thoughts
about who or why?

50:36.409 --> 50:39.577
All that l know
is that l felt really sorry for her.

50:40.371 --> 50:43.915
l got away when l was 18
and l never went back.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.418
And she'd have done the same.

50:46.961 --> 50:48.962
But she never made it to 18.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.756
Mr. Bjurman, please.
lt's Lisbeth Salander.

50:51.924 --> 50:54.008
Hold for a moment, please.

50:54.176 --> 50:56.219
Lisbeth, l haven't seen you.
Are you well?

50:56.387 --> 50:59.597
l'm fine. l'm sorry l missed our
appointment, l had a lot of work.

50:59.765 --> 51:00.890
Something the matter?

51:01.058 --> 51:03.685
No, no, nothing to be
concerned about.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.855
Actually, l need another advance
on my allowance.

51:07.022 --> 51:09.357
Can l come to your office tonight?

51:09.859 --> 51:11.651
l don't work at night, Lisbeth.

51:11.819 --> 51:14.612
Why don't you come to my house,
huh? Do you have a pen?

51:14.780 --> 51:16.656
l don't need a pen.
What's the address?

51:16.824 --> 51:18.324
lt's....

51:34.842 --> 51:37.385
-Hello?
-lt's me.

51:46.145 --> 51:47.979
Lisbeth.

51:48.147 --> 51:49.522
Come on in.

51:58.574 --> 52:00.241
-You like it?
-lt's nice.

52:00.659 --> 52:01.743
lt's home.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.330
What do you need money for
this time?

52:05.498 --> 52:06.539
Food.

52:10.836 --> 52:12.128
How are you?

52:18.344 --> 52:21.221
l'm so glad you decided
to come and visit.

52:21.847 --> 52:23.431
l just want my money.

52:23.599 --> 52:26.267
Well, let's see if we can
help you out with that.

52:37.363 --> 52:38.988
Wait.

52:39.365 --> 52:41.658
ls there a problem?

52:41.826 --> 52:43.785
l just want to know...

52:44.036 --> 52:46.955
...am l going to have to do this
every time l need money to eat?

52:47.248 --> 52:49.916
You're so cute when you're surly.

54:33.854 --> 54:35.855
l forgot to ask you:

54:36.815 --> 54:37.941
You like anal sex?

55:33.872 --> 55:37.041
Faith is the assurance
of things hoped for...

55:37.209 --> 55:41.421
...the evidence of things not seen.
Through faith we understand...

55:41.588 --> 55:45.091
...that the world was created
by the word of God.

56:33.307 --> 56:35.933
-l'll drive you home.
-l can get home on my own.

56:36.518 --> 56:38.186
Are you sure?

57:44.419 --> 57:46.963
-ls it any warmer inside?
-No.

57:48.507 --> 57:51.467
l apologize if you've been having
financial problems...

57:51.635 --> 57:53.886
...at the magazine
during Mikael's absence.

57:54.054 --> 57:56.222
-We'll work through them.
-Are you sure?

57:56.390 --> 57:58.141
How long do you think
you can hang on?

57:59.351 --> 58:00.476
Six months?

58:01.395 --> 58:02.603
That sounds about right.

58:02.771 --> 58:04.605
l used to be
in the newspaper business.

58:04.773 --> 58:07.692
-We owned six dailies back in the '50s.
-We still own one.

58:07.860 --> 58:10.987
-The Courier, here in town.
-Which l let my nephew, Birger, run...

58:11.155 --> 58:13.573
...because he can't run
anything else.

58:13.740 --> 58:16.200
So, what would you say
to taking on a partner?

58:17.703 --> 58:20.830
Well, we've never had
to consider it before.

58:22.040 --> 58:23.708
We value our independence
very much.

58:23.876 --> 58:26.419
lndependence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers.

58:26.587 --> 58:30.006
However much you have, you retain.
We don't care about content.

58:30.174 --> 58:33.301
Excuse me? Did l miss something?

58:33.468 --> 58:35.094
Talking about investing
in the magazine.

58:35.262 --> 58:39.182
-l gathered that. But why?
-Not out of greed, that's for sure.

58:39.349 --> 58:43.603
l feel badly that l've taken Mikael away
from you at the worst possible time.

58:43.770 --> 58:48.774
But now l am convinced that this is
the right thing to do. The moral thing.

58:49.234 --> 58:50.985
That's one reason. And....

58:52.821 --> 58:54.030
And...?

58:54.531 --> 58:57.200
The enemies of my friends
are my enemies.

58:57.743 --> 59:00.036
How long have you been
discussing this with them?

59:00.204 --> 59:02.830
l haven't. They called yesterday
and asked me to come up.

59:02.998 --> 59:05.208
-Why didn't you tell me?
-You live in the woods.

59:05.375 --> 59:09.921
-l deserve to be treated like an idiot?
-l wanted to hear what they had to say.

59:10.589 --> 59:12.381
You would've said no
before they could.

59:12.549 --> 59:14.425
Well, l'm saying it now.
lt's a bad idea.

59:14.718 --> 59:17.970
You heard me tell them
we had six months. l lied.

59:18.138 --> 59:20.097
We will be out of business in three.

59:20.265 --> 59:22.975
But you don't know this family
like l do. They're crazy.

59:23.143 --> 59:24.435
We're not marrying into it.

59:24.603 --> 59:27.730
lf we do this,
that's exactly what we're doing.

59:27.898 --> 59:30.191
So you wanna say no, let's say no.

59:30.400 --> 59:34.403
lnstead of 50 percent of something,
let's own 100 percent of nothing.

59:39.576 --> 59:40.993
-Mikael?
-What?

59:41.161 --> 59:43.537
l'm leaving this godforsaken island
in the morning.

59:43.705 --> 59:46.582
-So?
-So are you coming to bed or not?

59:53.799 --> 59:55.466
How much do one of those cost?

59:56.885 --> 59:59.345
Around 3000.

1:00:00.931 --> 1:00:02.974
This is really gonna hurt.

1:00:05.644 --> 1:00:06.727
Your call.

1:00:10.732 --> 1:00:14.902
Vanger Industries took a controlling
interest in Millennium magazine...

1:00:15.070 --> 1:00:18.155
...which, according to analysts,
has been in financial trouble....

1:00:18.323 --> 1:00:21.701
Millennium is an excellent magazine.
We think it's undervalued right now.

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:23.327
Which is good business for us.

1:00:23.495 --> 1:00:25.830
Well, there's another reason.
l don't like bullies.

1:00:25.998 --> 1:00:27.665
Are you referring
to Mr. Wennerström?

1:00:27.833 --> 1:00:31.669
l'm referring to anyone who tries
to sue his enemies into submission.

1:00:31.837 --> 1:00:34.297
lf Herr Wennerström
would like to try it again...

1:00:34.464 --> 1:00:37.842
...he will find himself fighting a
company that can afford to fight back.

1:00:38.010 --> 1:00:41.721
I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
He's a titan and a gentleman.

1:00:41.888 --> 1:00:43.764
But he's also quite old now...

1:00:43.932 --> 1:00:47.518
...which may explain how he could be
taken in by a convicted liar.

1:00:47.686 --> 1:00:48.728
Three-twenty.

1:01:07.122 --> 1:01:08.998
Shit.

1:02:50.016 --> 1:02:52.184
The current archive is on CDs.

1:02:52.352 --> 1:02:54.728
The older stuff, still negatives.

1:02:54.896 --> 1:02:57.231
What general period
are you interested in?

1:02:57.399 --> 1:02:58.983
September, 1966.

1:03:01.820 --> 1:03:03.320
Thank you.

1:03:09.077 --> 1:03:10.494
ls this about Harriet Vanger?

1:03:11.288 --> 1:03:12.955
You're too young
to know about that.

1:03:13.123 --> 1:03:16.000
Everyone here grows up
knowing about her.

1:03:17.711 --> 1:03:19.920
lt's how we're taught
about strangers.

1:03:27.387 --> 1:03:30.181
-Lisbeth.
-l need to pay my rent.

1:03:31.183 --> 1:03:32.475
l need some money.

1:03:33.602 --> 1:03:35.603
Oh, come on in.

1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:45.863
l feel a bit badly
how we left it last time.

1:03:46.031 --> 1:03:47.448
Me too.

1:04:34.913 --> 1:04:37.039
Good. You're alive.

1:04:40.835 --> 1:04:44.213
You recognize this? l had it with me
last time. l set it here, remember?

1:04:45.048 --> 1:04:47.424
And this snap, you see it?
lt's not a snap.

1:04:47.592 --> 1:04:50.302
lt's a wide-angle fiber-optics lens.

1:05:09.072 --> 1:05:11.282
l thought it was going to be
another blow job...

1:05:11.449 --> 1:05:13.242
...which is disgusting enough.

1:05:13.827 --> 1:05:16.620
But l misjudged
just how sick you are.

1:05:27.465 --> 1:05:30.426
Okay. Here's what's going to happen.

1:05:52.699 --> 1:05:54.575
Pay attention.

1:05:54.868 --> 1:05:56.035
Look at me.

1:05:58.330 --> 1:06:00.039
Once you can sit again...

1:06:00.206 --> 1:06:03.292
...which could be a while, l admit,
we're going to go to my bank...

1:06:03.460 --> 1:06:06.045
...and tell them that l alone
have access to my money.

1:06:06.212 --> 1:06:09.506
Nod. After that
you will never contact me again.

1:06:09.883 --> 1:06:13.636
Each month you will prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have.

1:06:14.679 --> 1:06:16.805
ln it, you'll describe
how well l'm doing.

1:06:16.973 --> 1:06:20.809
How "sociable" l'm becoming.
Then you will negotiate with the court...

1:06:20.977 --> 1:06:23.479
...to have my declaration
of incompetence lifted.

1:06:23.730 --> 1:06:27.650
lf you fail, this video will spread
across the internet like a virus.

1:06:27.817 --> 1:06:29.193
Nod.

1:06:30.403 --> 1:06:33.947
And if anything should happen to me,
if l get run over by a car...

1:06:34.115 --> 1:06:37.826
...if you run me over with a car,
this will upload automatically.

1:06:38.203 --> 1:06:39.995
Nod that you understand.

1:06:43.792 --> 1:06:45.626
Gabardine.

1:06:46.044 --> 1:06:49.797
l'm taking the keys to this apartment
because l'll be checking on you.

1:06:49.964 --> 1:06:54.843
lf l find a girl in here with you, whether
she came of her own free will or not....

1:06:56.930 --> 1:06:58.764
No, not the video.

1:07:07.482 --> 1:07:09.066
l'll kill you.

1:07:10.735 --> 1:07:12.695
Do you doubt anything l've said?

1:07:13.363 --> 1:07:17.324
Do you doubt what's in the reports that
have followed me around all my life?

1:07:17.492 --> 1:07:20.994
What do they say?
lf you had to sum it up.

1:07:21.162 --> 1:07:22.287
They say l'm insane.

1:07:23.832 --> 1:07:26.917
No, it's okay,
you can nod because it's true.

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:29.586
l am insane.

1:07:31.464 --> 1:07:32.881
Nod!

1:07:35.051 --> 1:07:38.303
l know it's going to be hard for you
to abide by my rules.

1:07:38.471 --> 1:07:40.431
The abstinence part most of all.

1:07:42.892 --> 1:07:44.935
So l'm going to make it
easier for you.

1:07:57.407 --> 1:07:58.490
Lie still.

1:07:58.658 --> 1:08:00.617
l've never done this before.

1:08:00.785 --> 1:08:02.786
And there will be blood.

1:09:28.289 --> 1:09:30.082
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:09:30.583 --> 1:09:31.750
What are you doing here?

1:09:31.918 --> 1:09:35.128
On my way to Skellefteå.
l can only stay a couple of hours.

1:09:37.173 --> 1:09:39.132
What's in Skellefteå?

1:09:40.051 --> 1:09:41.093
Bible camp.

1:09:42.846 --> 1:09:44.471
Oh, yeah.

1:10:04.909 --> 1:10:06.034
l'm not dangerous.

1:10:06.202 --> 1:10:10.205
lt's fine, Nilla.
Whatever you want to do is fine.

1:10:10.373 --> 1:10:12.040
Everybody needs something.

1:10:12.208 --> 1:10:13.625
Just as long as it's not God.

1:10:13.835 --> 1:10:15.627
l didn't say that.

1:10:19.257 --> 1:10:22.426
l haven't been around enough to
really know what's going on with you.

1:10:25.096 --> 1:10:29.600
And l apologize for that. But l'd never
want you not to tell me something...

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:32.102
...because you think
l might not want to hear it.

1:10:33.104 --> 1:10:34.771
That's what l'm doing.

1:10:36.107 --> 1:10:37.691
It should've been me visiting you.

1:10:37.859 --> 1:10:39.735
-l'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

1:10:39.903 --> 1:10:41.987
lt was nice seeing you.

1:10:42.447 --> 1:10:43.822
Bye-bye.

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:45.782
-l'll see you.
-Yeah.

1:10:45.992 --> 1:10:47.117
Thanks.

1:10:49.996 --> 1:10:51.955
Oh, don't go too hard
on the Catholics.

1:10:52.123 --> 1:10:54.082
-The what?
-The article you're writing.

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:56.418
Oh, l'm not writing
an article about Catholics.

1:10:56.586 --> 1:10:59.421
The Bible quotes by your desk.

1:10:59.797 --> 1:11:01.089
I love you.

1:11:38.670 --> 1:11:41.171
A woman who is a medium
or a sorcerer...

1:11:41.339 --> 1:11:44.466
...shall be put to death by stoning.

1:11:45.134 --> 1:11:47.511
lf a dove is the sinner's offering...

1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:51.223
...the priest shall wring off its head,
cleave its wings...

1:11:51.432 --> 1:11:53.350
...and burn it upon the altar.

1:11:56.187 --> 1:11:59.022
-Hello?
-Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist.

1:11:59.190 --> 1:12:00.565
Yes, hello. How are you?

1:12:00.733 --> 1:12:03.360
Not still freezing in Hedestad,
l hope, for your sake.

1:12:03.528 --> 1:12:06.488
You know that Rebecka case
you mentioned.

1:12:06.656 --> 1:12:08.240
Would you recall her last name?

1:12:08.449 --> 1:12:11.034
Of course l do.
But what has that to do with anything?

1:12:11.202 --> 1:12:13.787
-Nothing, probably.
-Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson.

1:12:16.874 --> 1:12:18.333
And how was she killed?

1:12:18.501 --> 1:12:20.377
She was decapitated.

1:12:20.545 --> 1:12:23.046
Her arms were cut off
and she was burned.

1:12:23.214 --> 1:12:26.508
But all that happened in the 1940s.

1:12:28.094 --> 1:12:30.303
-What have you found?
-l have to call you back.

1:12:30.471 --> 1:12:31.555
Why--?

1:12:44.777 --> 1:12:46.278
-ls it Henrik?
-We were talking.

1:12:46.446 --> 1:12:48.113
He rubbed his arm,
then he collapsed.

1:12:48.281 --> 1:12:51.074
-Think he's gonna be okay?
-l honestly don't know.

1:12:51.242 --> 1:12:53.076
-You go. Talk to you later.
-l'm sorry.

1:13:04.756 --> 1:13:05.839
Evening.

1:13:08.134 --> 1:13:10.260
So how is he?

1:13:10.428 --> 1:13:12.929
Well, the good news is he survived.

1:13:13.431 --> 1:13:15.057
How he does now, we'll have to see.

1:13:15.767 --> 1:13:18.268
-He's in intensive care.
-Right.

1:13:20.730 --> 1:13:23.023
-May l have one of those?
-You want a sandwich?

1:13:23.232 --> 1:13:26.234
-Small Scotch.
-Sure.

1:13:30.281 --> 1:13:31.782
Thank you.

1:13:32.408 --> 1:13:35.786
l hate to be indelicate,
but Henrik promised me something...

1:13:35.953 --> 1:13:38.163
-...when l agreed to do this.
-Wennerström.

1:13:38.331 --> 1:13:41.291
l need to know what he has on him.
Now. ln case....

1:13:41.459 --> 1:13:42.918
ln case he dies?

1:13:43.086 --> 1:13:45.921
-Well, that is indelicate.
-And l apologize.

1:13:46.089 --> 1:13:48.632
l don't know what he has on him,
if you're asking me.

1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:53.095
And he can't tell you
in the condition he's in, so....

1:13:53.805 --> 1:13:57.808
We also didn't discuss who l'd report
to if something should happen to him.

1:13:57.975 --> 1:13:59.810
Oh, well, you'd report to me,
of course.

1:14:00.645 --> 1:14:03.939
But we both know that nothing's
going to come of this, don't we?

1:14:04.816 --> 1:14:08.276
-No. No, we don't know that.
-What do you mean?

1:14:09.445 --> 1:14:11.947
-l may have found something.
-You're joking.

1:14:12.573 --> 1:14:13.657
What have you found?

1:14:14.700 --> 1:14:18.161
The last time l reported on something
without being absolutely sure...

1:14:18.329 --> 1:14:20.163
...l lost my life savings.

1:14:20.706 --> 1:14:23.333
l need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?

1:14:23.501 --> 1:14:26.670
Yes. Do you have one in mind?

1:14:26.921 --> 1:14:29.005
-l can find someone.
-l know an excellent one.

1:14:29.173 --> 1:14:30.841
She did the background check
on you.

1:14:31.008 --> 1:14:32.008
The what?

1:14:32.260 --> 1:14:34.761
Well, you don't think we can
hire just anyone...

1:14:34.929 --> 1:14:37.013
...without doing
a background check.

1:14:37.807 --> 1:14:39.141
l want to read that.

1:14:39.725 --> 1:14:42.811
Herr Frode was kind enough
to share your report with me.

1:14:42.979 --> 1:14:45.230
The investigator's name.
That is her name, yes?

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:50.193
See, l can't find any record of her,
and l'm pretty good at that.

1:14:50.695 --> 1:14:53.905
-Would it matter what her name is?
-lf l wanted to speak to her, yes.

1:14:54.115 --> 1:14:56.116
-lt's against policy.
-You sure?

1:14:56.284 --> 1:14:58.368
Just like your sources.
You understand.

1:14:58.536 --> 1:14:59.536
Okay.

1:15:00.663 --> 1:15:02.956
Here's a name for you.

1:15:03.124 --> 1:15:04.207
My sister.

1:15:04.375 --> 1:15:06.001
She's also my lawyer.

1:15:06.169 --> 1:15:07.544
She'll be contacting you.

1:15:07.712 --> 1:15:11.381
There are things in here that can
only have come from one place.

1:15:14.719 --> 1:15:18.680
The reason you can find no record of
her is because her records are sealed.

1:15:18.848 --> 1:15:22.350
-She's a ward of the state.
-What's that gotta do with anything?

1:15:23.352 --> 1:15:24.895
She's had a rough life.

1:15:26.314 --> 1:15:29.274
Can we please
not make it any rougher?

1:16:40.263 --> 1:16:42.013
Who is it?

1:16:42.181 --> 1:16:43.974
lt's Mikael Blomkvist.

1:16:48.479 --> 1:16:50.730
-Actually, l'm not really up yet.
-May l come in?

1:16:50.898 --> 1:16:52.315
Please?

1:16:58.864 --> 1:17:02.325
Hi. You and l need to talk.
l've got us some breakf--

1:17:02.785 --> 1:17:05.036
l'm sorry, l didn't realize
you had some company.

1:17:05.246 --> 1:17:07.038
Who do you think you are?

1:17:07.373 --> 1:17:10.166
l'm the guy you know better
than my closest friends do.

1:17:12.628 --> 1:17:16.006
Why don't you put some clothes on,
get rid of your girlfriend.

1:17:16.173 --> 1:17:17.299
We need to talk.

1:17:27.184 --> 1:17:29.227
l'm sorry, you have to go.

1:17:29.395 --> 1:17:31.104
Okay.

1:17:46.162 --> 1:17:48.204
Do you need me to stay?

1:17:48.873 --> 1:17:49.914
No.

1:17:57.173 --> 1:17:59.049
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:18:06.098 --> 1:18:07.140
Bye.

1:18:07.308 --> 1:18:08.350
-Sorry.
-lt's okay.

1:18:15.066 --> 1:18:17.484
l guess l must have alarmed you,
turning up like that.

1:18:17.651 --> 1:18:19.944
lf you touch me,
l'll more than alarm you.

1:18:20.112 --> 1:18:21.613
That won't be necessary.

1:18:22.740 --> 1:18:25.575
Your report, very detailed.

1:18:25.743 --> 1:18:28.745
-But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.
-lt wasn't meant to be.

1:18:28.996 --> 1:18:31.581
When l write about people,
l try to entertain the reader.

1:18:31.749 --> 1:18:33.750
Wennerström wasn't
entertained much.

1:18:37.922 --> 1:18:41.174
Your boss, Armansky...

1:18:41.342 --> 1:18:44.761
...yeah, he tells me you only do jobs
that interest you...

1:18:44.929 --> 1:18:47.430
...so l suppose l should be flattered.

1:18:48.182 --> 1:18:49.933
You gonna sit down?

1:18:50.726 --> 1:18:56.564
He also says that you're the one
he goes to when the job is sensitive.

1:18:56.732 --> 1:19:00.652
That's the word he used, "sensitive."
l'm gonna use "illegal"...

1:19:00.820 --> 1:19:03.947
...because that's what it was
when you hacked into my computer.

1:19:04.115 --> 1:19:07.075
No, l'm not gonna do anything
about that. l could, but l won't.

1:19:07.243 --> 1:19:09.869
What l'm gonna do
is l'm gonna tell you a story...

1:19:10.037 --> 1:19:13.790
...and if it entertains you, maybe you'll
decide to help me research further.

1:19:13.958 --> 1:19:17.127
And if not, l'll do the washing up
and you'll never see me again.

1:19:18.254 --> 1:19:20.213
Here, you should eat that.

1:19:20.923 --> 1:19:22.424
What kind of research?

1:19:22.967 --> 1:19:25.093
Lisbeth-- Oh, can l call you Lisbeth?

1:19:26.971 --> 1:19:29.139
l want you to help me catch
a killer of women.

1:19:30.933 --> 1:19:31.975
l've got R.J.

1:19:32.143 --> 1:19:34.602
Rebecka Jacobsson.
l've got absolutely no idea...

1:19:34.770 --> 1:19:37.355
...who the rest of these are
or how they're connected...

1:19:37.523 --> 1:19:40.525
...to the death of a 16-year-old girl,
but they must be somehow.

1:19:40.693 --> 1:19:43.987
What we've gotta do is find out who
they are, what happened to them...

1:19:44.155 --> 1:19:47.157
...and what these Leviticus verses
have to do with anything.

1:19:50.578 --> 1:19:52.328
-What are you doing?
-Getting started.

1:19:52.496 --> 1:19:56.040
-You can keep talking if you want.
-Don't you need to look over these?

1:19:56.292 --> 1:19:57.917
l got it.

1:20:43.214 --> 1:20:44.881
Cat!

1:21:14.537 --> 1:21:16.496
How'd you get in?

1:21:25.548 --> 1:21:27.799
No one has asked me about
Magda in over 40 years.

1:21:29.552 --> 1:21:32.428
Why would a lady like you want
to know about an awful murder?

1:21:32.596 --> 1:21:35.098
-lt interests me.
-Does it?

1:21:38.310 --> 1:21:40.270
Her husband was the first suspect.

1:21:40.437 --> 1:21:43.648
The husband is always
the first suspect and usually the last.

1:21:43.816 --> 1:21:47.277
But not this time.
We moved on to a neighbor.

1:21:47.444 --> 1:21:49.279
Then a vagrant.

1:21:49.446 --> 1:21:52.031
Once you get to strangers,
it's only a matter of time...

1:21:52.199 --> 1:21:55.743
...before you get to gypsies and you
know you're never going to solve it.

1:21:55.911 --> 1:21:58.204
How exactly was she killed?

1:21:59.039 --> 1:22:00.164
-Miss...?
-Salander.

1:22:00.332 --> 1:22:04.168
Miss Salander. l hope you don't mind
me asking, but when did you last eat?

1:22:04.336 --> 1:22:06.838
l have a high metabolism.
l can't put on weight.

1:22:07.006 --> 1:22:11.634
l'm asking because it is better to look
at what l am about to show you...

1:22:11.802 --> 1:22:13.136
...on an empty stomach.

1:22:16.432 --> 1:22:21.102
lf a man's offering is a lamb,
it shall be a female without blemish.

1:22:21.270 --> 1:22:23.313
He should lay his hand
upon its head...

1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:26.691
...slaughter it, empty its blood
on the base of the altar...

1:22:26.859 --> 1:22:28.860
...and he shall be forgiven.

1:22:33.866 --> 1:22:35.783
-How is he?
-He needs surgery...

1:22:35.951 --> 1:22:39.662
...but there's no DNR in place.
So it's up to the family to decide...

1:22:39.830 --> 1:22:42.665
...should the occasion arise,
whether to resuscitate or not.

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:46.002
And they're not good at decisions.

1:22:46.170 --> 1:22:47.712
So how was it with Miss Salander?

1:22:47.963 --> 1:22:50.882
She said yes. Do you think
l might be able to see him?

1:22:51.091 --> 1:22:54.010
He was asleep the last time l looked,
but let me check.

1:22:54.178 --> 1:22:55.678
-Thank you.
-Don't check.

1:22:56.096 --> 1:22:58.139
Tell him to pack his things
and leave.

1:22:58.307 --> 1:23:00.683
-Mother, please.
-Don't use that tone with me.

1:23:00.851 --> 1:23:03.519
lsabella, Mr. Blomkvist
works for Henrik.

1:23:03.687 --> 1:23:06.356
-We should put this to a vote.
-Don't be an idiot, Birger.

1:23:06.523 --> 1:23:08.858
We all know what Henrik wants.
Can we just do that?

1:23:09.026 --> 1:23:12.487
Henrik is fighting for his life in there.
This is the last thing he needs.

1:23:12.655 --> 1:23:15.323
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger,
there is no smoking in here.

1:23:17.910 --> 1:23:19.369
Go back to Stockholm.

1:23:19.536 --> 1:23:23.623
When we need a family chronicle
written by a libelist...

1:23:24.208 --> 1:23:25.917
...we know who to call.

1:23:31.757 --> 1:23:34.217
All right. Thanks.

1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:36.886
This way, miss.

1:23:40.724 --> 1:23:43.059
lf a woman approaches any beast...

1:23:43.227 --> 1:23:46.729
...and lies with it, you shall kill
the woman and the beast.

1:23:46.897 --> 1:23:49.065
Their blood shall be upon them.

1:24:02.579 --> 1:24:04.455
My family's impossible.

1:24:04.623 --> 1:24:06.749
That's why the company's
such a mess.

1:24:07.584 --> 1:24:09.293
l apologize for my
mother's behavior.

1:24:10.254 --> 1:24:11.295
l'm used to it.

1:24:11.463 --> 1:24:14.799
lt has nothing to do with you.
lt's between her and Henrik.

1:24:14.967 --> 1:24:18.261
She lost it when my father died,
and her drinking and her....

1:24:19.221 --> 1:24:23.057
Got so bad Henrik took me
and my sister away from her...

1:24:23.225 --> 1:24:26.644
...and left her excommunicated
in the old house...

1:24:26.812 --> 1:24:28.563
...on the other side of the island.

1:24:28.731 --> 1:24:30.273
She hasn't forgiven him.

1:24:32.484 --> 1:24:33.943
You must stay.

1:24:34.737 --> 1:24:38.448
You're the last chance Henrik has
at some kind of resolution.

1:24:38.615 --> 1:24:40.491
Put this to rest one way or another.

1:24:40.701 --> 1:24:41.993
l'll keep my mother away.

1:24:42.286 --> 1:24:44.454
But please, hurry.

1:24:44.955 --> 1:24:46.080
Of course.

1:24:58.802 --> 1:25:00.261
Lisbeth.

1:25:00.429 --> 1:25:02.138
-l'll get that.
-lt's okay.

1:25:02.931 --> 1:25:04.348
-Martin Vanger.
-How do you do?

1:25:04.516 --> 1:25:05.767
Fine.

1:25:10.773 --> 1:25:13.316
-lt's a girlfriend, or...?
-Assistant.

1:25:13.942 --> 1:25:15.109
Thank you so much.

1:25:15.736 --> 1:25:17.987
-Good night.
-Good night.

1:25:22.284 --> 1:25:23.618
Problems finding the place?

1:25:23.786 --> 1:25:25.870
Everyone in town knows
who and where you are.

1:25:26.038 --> 1:25:28.956
That's comforting. Are you hungry?
l can make you a sandwich.

1:25:29.124 --> 1:25:30.333
No.

1:25:32.002 --> 1:25:34.045
l used to have a motorbike,
a Triumph.

1:25:34.213 --> 1:25:35.505
l know.

1:25:35.672 --> 1:25:37.882
The five cases from Harriet's list.

1:25:38.050 --> 1:25:40.635
And five more she missed.
Three l'm sure of.

1:25:41.512 --> 1:25:43.846
Rebecka was the first,
just as you thought.

1:25:44.014 --> 1:25:47.308
The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg,
a prostitute in Kalmar...

1:25:47.476 --> 1:25:50.311
...murdered in 1954,
matching Leviticus 20:18.

1:25:50.479 --> 1:25:53.189
Right. "lf a man lies with a woman
having her sickness...

1:25:53.357 --> 1:25:56.025
...he has made naked her fountain
and she has uncovered...

1:25:56.193 --> 1:25:57.610
...the fountain of her blood."

1:25:57.778 --> 1:26:01.364
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death
was suffocation by sanitary napkin.

1:26:01.824 --> 1:26:04.659
-Okay.
-R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957.

1:26:04.827 --> 1:26:07.328
A cleaning woman
and part-time palm reader.

1:26:07.496 --> 1:26:11.040
Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped.
Head crushed with a rock.

1:26:11.208 --> 1:26:12.708
Leviticus 20:27.

1:26:12.876 --> 1:26:14.710
"A woman who is a medium
or sorceress...

1:26:14.878 --> 1:26:17.046
...shall be put to death by stoning."

1:26:17.297 --> 1:26:21.217
-l usually like to smoke outside.
-Sara Witt, 1964.

1:26:21.385 --> 1:26:23.302
Daughter of a pastor.
Tied to her bed.

1:26:23.470 --> 1:26:26.097
Raped. Charred in the fire
that burned down her house.

1:26:26.306 --> 1:26:27.723
Leviticus 21 :9.

1:26:27.891 --> 1:26:31.185
"The daughter of a priest who profanes
herself by playing the harlot...

1:26:31.353 --> 1:26:33.813
...profanes her father
and shall be burned with fire."

1:26:33.981 --> 1:26:35.690
Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960.

1:26:35.858 --> 1:26:38.234
Found in a barn.
Stabbed and raped with farm tools.

1:26:38.402 --> 1:26:40.528
The cow in the next stall
had its throat slit.

1:26:40.696 --> 1:26:42.738
lts blood was splashed on her
and hers on it.

1:26:42.906 --> 1:26:45.449
Leviticus 20:16.
"lf a woman lies with any beast...

1:26:45.617 --> 1:26:48.995
...you shall kill the woman and the
beast. Their blood is upon them."

1:26:49.162 --> 1:26:50.371
Lea Persson, 1962.

1:26:50.539 --> 1:26:53.457
Found by her sister in their pet shop.
Raped, beaten.

1:26:53.709 --> 1:26:56.252
The killer uncaged the animals,
smashed the aquariums.

1:26:56.420 --> 1:26:58.254
There was a parakeet inside her.

1:26:58.755 --> 1:27:00.965
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960.

1:27:01.133 --> 1:27:05.428
A runaway. Raped, strangled.
A burnt pigeon tied around her neck.

1:27:05.846 --> 1:27:09.765
Lena Andersson, 1967. A student.
Raped, stabbed, decapitated--

1:27:09.933 --> 1:27:12.268
-Okay.
-l'm not finished.

1:27:12.436 --> 1:27:14.270
We're looking for
a serial murderer...

1:27:14.438 --> 1:27:17.773
...but what could that have to do
with a teenager living on an island?

1:27:18.609 --> 1:27:20.776
She was looking for him too.

1:27:21.862 --> 1:27:23.237
Rape. Torture. Fire.

1:27:23.405 --> 1:27:25.323
Animals. Religion.

1:27:25.657 --> 1:27:27.783
-Am l missing anything?
-The names.

1:27:29.119 --> 1:27:30.286
They're all Biblical.

1:27:30.454 --> 1:27:32.955
The first woman, the whore,
the Virgin Mary.

1:27:33.123 --> 1:27:36.834
Rebecka, Sara,
all from the Old Testament.

1:27:37.002 --> 1:27:39.086
Which means they're all Jewish.

1:27:40.923 --> 1:27:45.259
One thing the Vangers have more than
their fair share of, it's anti-Semites.

1:27:47.888 --> 1:27:50.640
There's one right there.

1:27:53.477 --> 1:27:55.561
l can sleep on a couch.

1:27:56.355 --> 1:27:58.022
Okay.

1:27:58.732 --> 1:27:59.815
Right.

1:28:00.567 --> 1:28:04.320
Oh, yeah, there might be
a cat somewhere.

1:28:04.488 --> 1:28:05.905
-Good night.
-Night.

1:28:06.114 --> 1:28:08.366
Harriet's name isn't.

1:28:09.993 --> 1:28:11.160
lsn't what?

1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:15.122
-Jewish.
-No.

1:28:43.151 --> 1:28:45.027
-What are you doing?
-Reading your notes.

1:28:45.195 --> 1:28:46.696
They're encrypted.

1:28:46.863 --> 1:28:49.615
Please. Have some coffee.

1:28:49.783 --> 1:28:50.866
Okay.

1:28:52.035 --> 1:28:54.453
Then we're gonna have
a very serious conversation...

1:28:54.621 --> 1:28:56.872
...about what's yours
and what's mine.

1:28:57.791 --> 1:29:00.418
lt's amazing what you figured out
with the parade photos.

1:29:00.585 --> 1:29:02.253
Thank you.

1:29:02.879 --> 1:29:06.257
-lt's too bad you don't have hers.
-Whose?

1:29:07.551 --> 1:29:09.051
Her.

1:29:12.556 --> 1:29:14.348
Can l--? Sorry.

1:29:15.726 --> 1:29:16.892
Yeah, all right.

1:29:17.060 --> 1:29:18.519
Close that.

1:29:18.687 --> 1:29:20.021
No. Not that.

1:29:20.897 --> 1:29:22.982
That's the one. Yep.

1:29:23.150 --> 1:29:27.737
Where the fuck's that? That's down
there, isn't it? Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:29:27.904 --> 1:29:29.572
And....

1:29:31.616 --> 1:29:33.325
What does that say there?

1:29:34.244 --> 1:29:37.621
-"N" something "R-S-J."
-That's "Norsjö," yeah.

1:29:37.831 --> 1:29:40.958
Then something "K."
Something "R-l-F."

1:29:41.126 --> 1:29:42.752
"Carpentry."

1:29:43.253 --> 1:29:45.963
Well, we need to find a carpenter.

1:29:48.467 --> 1:29:49.717
Fuck!

1:30:44.397 --> 1:30:47.817
The carpentry shop is gone. l don't
even know if he worked there or not...

1:30:47.984 --> 1:30:51.153
...but if he did, maybe he used
to come in here for hardware.

1:30:51.321 --> 1:30:53.447
l don't recognize him. Sorry.

1:30:53.615 --> 1:30:56.283
Well, l had to start somewhere.

1:30:56.993 --> 1:31:02.331
l'm no detective, but 1966, l would
have started at a retirement home.

1:31:09.297 --> 1:31:10.798
This is Brännlund's kid.

1:31:10.966 --> 1:31:13.175
Do you know where l might find him?
The son?

1:31:13.343 --> 1:31:15.719
Next to his father at the cemetery.

1:31:15.929 --> 1:31:20.182
He was killed in an accident
on a construction site, years ago.

1:31:22.018 --> 1:31:23.602
But...

1:31:25.188 --> 1:31:27.523
...she might still be alive.
His widow.

1:31:28.441 --> 1:31:30.651
Do you know where
l might find her?

1:31:38.660 --> 1:31:40.578
Please drive to highlighted route.

1:31:41.580 --> 1:31:46.083
ln 1966, you were in Hedestad
with your husband.

1:31:47.752 --> 1:31:49.211
Who took these?

1:31:49.379 --> 1:31:50.629
A local photographer.

1:31:50.797 --> 1:31:52.673
You were taking pictures
too that day...

1:31:52.841 --> 1:31:55.968
...and l'd love to look at them
if by some miracle you have them.

1:31:56.136 --> 1:31:58.470
lt wouldn't be a miracle.
We were on our honeymoon.

1:31:58.763 --> 1:32:00.556
But why?

1:32:00.724 --> 1:32:04.810
This girl here. Here, you can see
her better in the enlargement.

1:32:04.978 --> 1:32:07.438
See, that's you there.
Just after this was taken...

1:32:07.606 --> 1:32:11.066
...after she'd seen something
across the street, she was murdered.

1:32:12.986 --> 1:32:15.112
How awful.

1:32:25.415 --> 1:32:27.583
-There you are.
-Thank you.

1:32:46.603 --> 1:32:48.437
Would you mind if l made
a copy of this?

1:32:48.605 --> 1:32:49.605
No.

1:32:51.066 --> 1:32:54.610
l can't give you any of this stuff without
authorization from Mr. Armansky.

1:32:54.778 --> 1:32:56.445
So call him.

1:33:04.746 --> 1:33:07.456
Next time,
fill out the proper paperwork.

1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:19.969
Which one are you?

1:33:34.776 --> 1:33:36.443
Going down.

1:33:43.201 --> 1:33:44.994
How's your sex life?

1:33:46.788 --> 1:33:48.831
l didn't care much
for your last report.

1:33:48.999 --> 1:33:51.875
lt felt perfunctory,
like your heart wasn't in it.

1:33:52.085 --> 1:33:55.212
Let's see a little more enthusiasm
for my recovery in next month's.

1:33:55.380 --> 1:33:58.007
Don't speak. l don't want to hear
your voice, just nod.

1:33:58.174 --> 1:34:00.175
Start looking for a shrink
you can bribe...

1:34:00.343 --> 1:34:04.179
...to swear under oath he can find
absolutely nothing wrong with me.

1:34:04.347 --> 1:34:06.515
And stop visiting
tattoo-removal websites.

1:34:06.891 --> 1:34:08.350
Or l'll do it again...

1:34:09.853 --> 1:34:11.437
...right here.

1:36:59.689 --> 1:37:02.191
-ls that dental floss?
-Yes.

1:37:05.695 --> 1:37:07.738
You're gonna sterilize that, right?

1:37:11.534 --> 1:37:13.702
Couldn't we just use tape
or something?

1:37:13.870 --> 1:37:15.245
No.

1:37:16.623 --> 1:37:17.664
What?

1:37:20.502 --> 1:37:22.920
Thank you. Jesus!

1:37:23.087 --> 1:37:25.756
-Drink.
-Okay.

1:37:27.926 --> 1:37:29.593
Just be careful. lt's my eye.

1:37:29.802 --> 1:37:32.387
-Don't move.
-You're not a doctor.

1:37:46.528 --> 1:37:49.071
-Take off your wet clothes.
-What?

1:37:49.822 --> 1:37:52.407
Yeah. Thank you.

1:37:54.452 --> 1:37:57.454
Yeah, l think it's stopped bleeding.

1:37:57.622 --> 1:38:00.374
lt still fucking hurts, though.

1:38:04.963 --> 1:38:06.004
Madness.

1:38:13.930 --> 1:38:17.099
l mean, madness.
This is fucking madness.

1:38:19.143 --> 1:38:22.437
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

1:38:26.234 --> 1:38:28.944
Jesus, that hurts. Fuck.

1:38:34.951 --> 1:38:38.620
This is insane.
l mean, these people--

1:38:38.955 --> 1:38:42.165
Somebody was shooting at me.
l mean, it wasn't an accident.

1:38:42.375 --> 1:38:44.334
No one's shooting at you now.

1:38:47.755 --> 1:38:49.798
You know, l'm pretty sure
this is a bad idea.

1:38:49.966 --> 1:38:51.091
Why?

1:38:51.259 --> 1:38:53.302
l'm old and we work together--

1:38:53.469 --> 1:38:55.762
You work with what's-her-name
and that's worked out for you.

1:38:55.930 --> 1:38:59.266
Yeah, well, l do have some standards,
believe it or not.

1:39:00.143 --> 1:39:01.435
You need to stop talking.

1:39:10.111 --> 1:39:11.820
Oh, shit.

1:39:45.688 --> 1:39:47.689
Do you want me to open a window?

1:40:14.717 --> 1:40:17.719
-l like working with you.
-l like working with you too.

1:40:25.061 --> 1:40:27.521
-lt could have been a stray shot.
-Not by Gunnar.

1:40:27.689 --> 1:40:29.815
lf he wanted to shoot him,
he wouldn't be here.

1:40:29.982 --> 1:40:32.901
And then we have poachers.
They shoot at anything that moves.

1:40:33.069 --> 1:40:35.237
Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is?

1:40:35.863 --> 1:40:37.072
This has to stop.

1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:38.615
Do you want to stop, Mikael?

1:40:38.783 --> 1:40:40.784
Look, l have police reports, photos...

1:40:40.952 --> 1:40:43.412
...Henrik's notes, my notes,
Lisbeth's research.

1:40:43.579 --> 1:40:47.416
What l don't have is Vanger lndustries'
records. That's what l want.

1:40:47.583 --> 1:40:50.419
-Why?
-Will you authorize it?

1:40:50.586 --> 1:40:53.213
What, the private corporate records?
Well, how far back?

1:40:53.381 --> 1:40:56.425
Henrik said l could have access
to everything. This is what l need.

1:40:56.592 --> 1:41:00.137
-That's not what he meant.
-l'll sign a nondisclosure statement.

1:41:00.304 --> 1:41:01.638
Just a minute.

1:41:04.517 --> 1:41:05.934
l think Henrik would say yes.

1:41:06.102 --> 1:41:10.897
That's why he has me. To protect
him from himself. lt's insane.

1:41:11.274 --> 1:41:12.441
What have we got to hide?

1:41:12.608 --> 1:41:16.319
After 120 years of business,
probably a lot.

1:41:16.529 --> 1:41:19.531
lf this is what he needs to finish,
he should have permission.

1:41:23.619 --> 1:41:25.620
What am l looking for?

1:41:25.955 --> 1:41:28.290
Any connections between
Vanger lndustries...

1:41:28.458 --> 1:41:31.209
...and the towns
where the women were killed.

1:41:31.627 --> 1:41:33.795
And everything about Frode.

1:42:25.807 --> 1:42:29.559
Your father was taking pictures
that day that no one has seen.

1:42:29.727 --> 1:42:32.270
-l'd like to take a look at them.
-So ask him.

1:42:32.438 --> 1:42:35.440
-l was wondering if you could do that.
-l don't speak to him.

1:42:35.608 --> 1:42:37.442
Could you make an exception
in my case?

1:42:37.902 --> 1:42:40.028
Are you afraid to be
in the same room with him?

1:42:40.196 --> 1:42:41.988
l'm not saying you shouldn't be.

1:42:42.448 --> 1:42:43.740
So you won't help me?

1:42:46.035 --> 1:42:47.661
Sorry.

1:42:52.542 --> 1:42:53.625
Please?

1:42:55.336 --> 1:42:58.004
-Are you finished?
-l need to know where all factories...

1:42:58.172 --> 1:43:01.299
...offices and projects
were from 1949 to 1966.

1:43:01.467 --> 1:43:03.510
-You already have everything.
-No, l don't.

1:43:03.719 --> 1:43:06.847
Nothing on subsidiary corporations,
partnerships or suppliers.

1:43:07.014 --> 1:43:09.850
-You'll have to do without.
-Mr. Frode said l have access...

1:43:10.017 --> 1:43:13.144
-...to whatever l need. l need this.
-You have access to this floor.

1:43:13.312 --> 1:43:14.354
Call him.

1:43:51.893 --> 1:43:53.018
Thank you for seeing me.

1:43:55.897 --> 1:43:57.522
Come in.

1:43:59.483 --> 1:44:00.984
-Tea?
-Please.

1:44:09.410 --> 1:44:10.744
Sven Olov Lindholm.

1:44:11.203 --> 1:44:12.245
Me.

1:44:12.914 --> 1:44:14.164
Handsome.

1:44:15.082 --> 1:44:16.875
Birger Furugård.

1:44:17.043 --> 1:44:18.418
Me.

1:44:19.295 --> 1:44:20.837
Per Engdahl.

1:44:21.005 --> 1:44:25.300
But your interest is in my more
candid photographic work.

1:44:25.468 --> 1:44:27.677
Friends, relations, that kind of thing.

1:44:28.095 --> 1:44:29.638
Please.

1:44:55.748 --> 1:44:58.041
"Blom" or "Bloom"?

1:44:58.209 --> 1:44:59.376
Blomkvist.

1:45:01.337 --> 1:45:03.046
l'm not a recluse.

1:45:04.131 --> 1:45:06.341
l don't close my door to anybody.

1:45:06.509 --> 1:45:07.550
Thank you.

1:45:07.718 --> 1:45:09.594
They just don't visit.

1:45:09.971 --> 1:45:11.221
Well...

1:45:12.598 --> 1:45:14.557
...perhaps if you redecorated.

1:45:14.725 --> 1:45:17.477
Hide the past like they do?

1:45:17.645 --> 1:45:19.646
Under a thin, shiny veneer?

1:45:19.855 --> 1:45:21.147
Like an lKEA table?

1:45:21.732 --> 1:45:24.109
l am the most honest of all of them.

1:45:24.276 --> 1:45:26.653
-The family?
-Sweden.

1:45:37.915 --> 1:45:39.749
Landscape?

1:45:40.668 --> 1:45:42.460
Some nice landscapes there?

1:45:42.962 --> 1:45:44.170
Who is this?

1:45:44.505 --> 1:45:46.256
The blurry one.

1:45:46.424 --> 1:45:47.799
l can't tell.

1:45:48.884 --> 1:45:50.510
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy.

1:45:51.178 --> 1:45:52.554
-That's Martin.
-Yeah.

1:45:52.722 --> 1:45:55.432
Handsome but useless young man.
Like his father.

1:45:55.599 --> 1:45:56.683
Like his father.

1:46:09.530 --> 1:46:11.531
-We're closing.
-Nowhere near finished.

1:46:14.035 --> 1:46:16.619
-l'm not authorized to stay late.
-l am.

1:46:16.787 --> 1:46:20.373
And l need access to everything,
including anything that's locked.

1:46:22.835 --> 1:46:24.210
Call Frode.

1:46:34.638 --> 1:46:36.222
Leave the keys with the guard.

1:49:04.872 --> 1:49:06.789
Come on.

1:49:10.377 --> 1:49:12.128
Shit!

1:50:48.058 --> 1:50:49.100
Martin?

1:54:07.299 --> 1:54:08.341
Mikael.

1:54:12.012 --> 1:54:13.554
Hi there.

1:54:14.181 --> 1:54:16.265
Your evening stroll?

1:54:16.892 --> 1:54:18.684
Yes, that's right, l....

1:54:21.104 --> 1:54:23.022
-How are you?
-Good.

1:54:24.608 --> 1:54:27.568
l stopped by the hospital
on my way home.

1:54:27.736 --> 1:54:29.487
Henrik asked me
to ask you something.

1:54:30.197 --> 1:54:31.280
What was that?

1:54:32.366 --> 1:54:35.368
Come on in. l'll make you a drink.

1:55:23.542 --> 1:55:24.959
Hello, Martin.

1:55:26.503 --> 1:55:29.213
Shut the door. lt's quite windy.

1:55:34.177 --> 1:55:36.095
-What happened to you?
-When?

1:55:36.263 --> 1:55:37.597
Just now.

1:55:37.764 --> 1:55:40.099
l fell in the dark.

1:55:40.267 --> 1:55:42.852
You don't have a flashlight?
l'll get you one.

1:55:43.020 --> 1:55:45.688
l just wasn't being careful, that's all.

1:55:52.237 --> 1:55:54.614
How's the investigation going?

1:55:55.073 --> 1:55:57.283
-Nothing new to report.
-No?

1:55:57.951 --> 1:56:02.121
Dirch says the girl is really clever.

1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:08.544
Maybe she'll turn something up.

1:56:08.712 --> 1:56:09.920
Maybe.

1:56:10.088 --> 1:56:11.631
Thank you for that.

1:56:17.804 --> 1:56:19.805
-So, what did he say?
-What?

1:56:19.973 --> 1:56:22.058
You said Henrik asked you
to ask me something.

1:56:22.225 --> 1:56:24.226
-Well, l just did.
-What?

1:56:24.394 --> 1:56:26.896
-How's the investigation?
-Oh, yeah.

1:56:27.064 --> 1:56:28.981
That was his question.

1:56:35.822 --> 1:56:37.448
Do you hunt?

1:56:38.492 --> 1:56:40.242
We should go hunting
together sometime.

1:56:40.410 --> 1:56:41.827
Sure.

1:56:44.456 --> 1:56:48.125
Nothing at all new to report?

1:56:48.293 --> 1:56:49.418
No. Nothing.

1:56:50.337 --> 1:56:52.421
-l can see you're anxious.
-No.

1:56:52.589 --> 1:56:54.757
No, l mean to get home
after the walk.

1:56:54.925 --> 1:56:56.842
Yeah, well, l suppose l am.

1:56:57.010 --> 1:56:59.345
To have dinner with your girlfriend.

1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:00.805
Assistant.

1:57:04.559 --> 1:57:06.352
We'll have better luck with a gun.

1:57:06.561 --> 1:57:09.146
-l'm sorry?
-When we go hunting.

1:57:10.315 --> 1:57:13.192
A gun. Rather than a knife.

1:57:17.197 --> 1:57:18.823
l want to show you something.

1:57:20.367 --> 1:57:21.701
Bring your drink.

1:57:21.868 --> 1:57:23.452
Leave my knife.

1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:41.387
To the right.

1:57:45.726 --> 1:57:47.226
Hi, leave a message. l'll call--

1:57:47.394 --> 1:57:50.229
You know what's harder
than shooting someone?

1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:51.731
Just missing him.

1:57:52.566 --> 1:57:54.984
That was a very good shot
up at the cabin.

1:57:55.152 --> 1:57:57.653
lt didn't work. l'm here.

1:57:57.821 --> 1:58:01.157
Mikael, it did work. You're here.

1:58:34.024 --> 1:58:35.232
lnside.

1:59:14.773 --> 1:59:16.732
You spilled your drink.

1:59:28.203 --> 1:59:30.329
Why didn't you just go home?

1:59:30.997 --> 1:59:32.498
May l?

1:59:37.587 --> 1:59:39.171
How did you do it?

1:59:40.841 --> 1:59:42.216
What did you find?

1:59:45.804 --> 1:59:48.138
We can talk
or we can just get on with it.

1:59:48.849 --> 1:59:51.183
l found a photograph...

1:59:51.643 --> 1:59:53.185
...no one has seen.

1:59:53.353 --> 1:59:54.520
-Of?
-You.

1:59:55.146 --> 1:59:57.022
ln an Uppsala prep school blazer.

1:59:57.232 --> 1:59:59.108
What does that prove?

1:59:59.276 --> 2:00:01.235
You lied about
where you were that day.

2:00:01.403 --> 2:00:03.362
-Did l?
-Or rather, when.

2:00:04.030 --> 2:00:06.365
So what? People lie all the time.

2:00:06.533 --> 2:00:10.160
lt also says that you and Lena
Andersson were schoolmates.

2:00:10.328 --> 2:00:12.037
Lena....

2:00:13.039 --> 2:00:15.416
That was a long time ago.

2:00:16.585 --> 2:00:19.670
Where's this photo now? ls it with
all the other crap on your desk?

2:00:19.838 --> 2:00:22.381
There's a copy on my laptop.
There's another copy...

2:00:22.549 --> 2:00:25.217
-...on a secure website.
-Secure website.

2:00:25.677 --> 2:00:27.386
That's a lie.

2:00:29.055 --> 2:00:30.556
How much does the girl know?

2:00:31.892 --> 2:00:33.559
l hope it's as much as you do.

2:00:33.727 --> 2:00:35.561
That'll make it fun.

2:00:36.521 --> 2:00:37.563
Where is she?

2:00:37.772 --> 2:00:39.899
Stockholm. She went this morning.

2:00:40.066 --> 2:00:41.567
That's a lie.

2:00:41.735 --> 2:00:44.778
She's at our offices
looking at more old crap.

2:00:44.946 --> 2:00:47.072
l got a call
from our archives manager.

2:00:47.240 --> 2:00:50.284
She was very perturbed
with this girl Lisbeth.

2:00:50.452 --> 2:00:52.077
l like that name.

2:00:52.287 --> 2:00:53.996
Lisbeth.

2:00:54.581 --> 2:00:58.584
So when Lisbeth leaves,
l will get a call from security...

2:00:58.793 --> 2:01:02.046
...so l can be at your cottage
to greet her.

2:01:03.673 --> 2:01:06.967
l can't thank you enough
for bringing her to me.

2:01:07.510 --> 2:01:09.094
Hey, hey.

2:01:35.455 --> 2:01:37.790
So, what do you wanna know?

2:01:40.293 --> 2:01:42.586
You're a journalist,
ask me questions.

2:01:47.759 --> 2:01:49.718
What do l do with the girls?

2:01:49.886 --> 2:01:50.970
That's a good question.

2:01:51.888 --> 2:01:53.764
Well, before, l do what we're doing:

2:01:53.974 --> 2:01:56.266
Sit down, relax, have a drink.

2:01:56.476 --> 2:01:57.601
l like that part a lot.

2:01:57.769 --> 2:02:01.271
Having a chat when both of you know
that one of you is going to die.

2:02:02.273 --> 2:02:05.901
And afterwards, l just get rid of them,
far out at sea.

2:02:06.111 --> 2:02:08.737
Unlike my father,
who left them scattered...

2:02:08.905 --> 2:02:12.408
...all over the place, like trophies.
That's not very smart, if you ask me.

2:02:13.118 --> 2:02:14.910
Well, he was a loud
and garish man.

2:02:15.870 --> 2:02:18.163
Frankly, he got what he deserved.

2:02:19.165 --> 2:02:21.500
You can't be a sloppy technician
like that.

2:02:21.668 --> 2:02:23.919
You can't drink to excess
like he did.

2:02:24.087 --> 2:02:25.587
This takes discipline.

2:02:26.256 --> 2:02:28.674
lt's a science of a thousand details.

2:02:29.050 --> 2:02:31.719
The planning, the execution.

2:02:31.886 --> 2:02:33.595
lt's the cleanup.

2:02:34.222 --> 2:02:36.015
l guess l don't have to tell you...

2:02:36.182 --> 2:02:39.351
...but you're going to create
quite a mess here.

2:02:42.105 --> 2:02:44.023
Let me ask you something.

2:02:44.190 --> 2:02:46.817
Why don't people
trust their instincts?

2:02:47.736 --> 2:02:49.236
They sense something is wrong...

2:02:49.404 --> 2:02:51.864
...someone is walking too close
behind them.

2:02:52.323 --> 2:02:54.533
You knew something was wrong.

2:02:54.826 --> 2:02:56.535
But you came back into the house.

2:02:56.703 --> 2:02:59.872
Did l force you?
Did l drag you in? No.

2:03:00.707 --> 2:03:04.126
All l had to do was offer you a drink.

2:03:04.753 --> 2:03:07.129
lt's hard to believe that
the fear of offending...

2:03:07.297 --> 2:03:12.259
...can be stronger than the fear
of pain, but you know what? lt is.

2:03:13.887 --> 2:03:15.721
And they always come willingly.

2:03:16.181 --> 2:03:17.473
And then they sit there.

2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:20.142
They know it's all over,
just like you do.

2:03:20.310 --> 2:03:23.187
But somehow,
they still think they have a chance.

2:03:23.354 --> 2:03:25.314
"Maybe if l say the right thing.

2:03:25.482 --> 2:03:27.316
Maybe if l'm polite.

2:03:27.484 --> 2:03:29.735
lf l cry, if l beg."

2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:32.738
And when l see the hope
draining from their face...

2:03:32.906 --> 2:03:35.365
...like it is from yours right now...

2:03:35.658 --> 2:03:37.242
...l can feel myself...

2:03:37.786 --> 2:03:39.078
...getting hard.

2:03:40.580 --> 2:03:44.958
But, you know, we're not that different,
you and l. We both have urges.

2:03:45.126 --> 2:03:46.752
Satisfying mine...

2:03:47.337 --> 2:03:49.421
...requires more towels.

2:04:11.402 --> 2:04:13.195
lt might amuse you to know...

2:04:13.613 --> 2:04:18.200
...that while you were upstairs
having moose with me and Liv...

2:04:18.785 --> 2:04:22.955
...who, by the way,
finds me very conventional...

2:04:23.790 --> 2:04:25.707
...l had lrina down here in that cage.

2:04:26.459 --> 2:04:28.919
Who is lrina, you might ask?

2:04:29.087 --> 2:04:30.921
Just another girl.

2:04:31.464 --> 2:04:34.550
Just another immigrant whore.

2:04:35.218 --> 2:04:37.010
-Who misses them?
-Your sister wasn't.

2:04:37.637 --> 2:04:38.804
What?

2:04:38.972 --> 2:04:43.433
Your sister Harriet
wasn't just another girl.

2:04:43.643 --> 2:04:45.477
You found her?

2:04:47.313 --> 2:04:48.856
What happened to her?

2:04:50.984 --> 2:04:53.527
You killed her.

2:04:57.866 --> 2:05:01.034
You useless fucking detective.

2:05:05.582 --> 2:05:09.918
This too tight to talk?
Good. l'm tired of talking to you.

2:05:47.290 --> 2:05:49.208
l've never had a man in here before.

2:05:55.506 --> 2:05:57.299
ln fact, l've never touched a man...

2:05:57.467 --> 2:05:59.384
...except my father.

2:06:00.887 --> 2:06:03.013
That was our duty.

2:06:04.224 --> 2:06:06.308
Harriet's and mine.

2:06:20.114 --> 2:06:21.406
Hey.

2:06:37.757 --> 2:06:40.300
There's a gun.
There's a gun on the television.

2:06:47.392 --> 2:06:49.351
-May l kill him?
-Yeah.

2:09:58.583 --> 2:10:01.668
How come a 23-year-old...

2:10:01.836 --> 2:10:04.546
...is a ward of the state?

2:10:07.758 --> 2:10:11.803
l'm mentally incompetent
and can't manage daily life.

2:10:14.348 --> 2:10:17.017
Since when have they said that?

2:10:17.185 --> 2:10:19.895
Since l was 12.

2:10:21.355 --> 2:10:23.148
What happened when you were 12?

2:10:27.111 --> 2:10:30.906
l'm sorry,
that's none of my business.

2:10:33.409 --> 2:10:35.118
l tried to kill my father.

2:10:37.288 --> 2:10:39.372
Burned him alive.

2:10:39.999 --> 2:10:44.127
Got about 80 percent of him.

2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:52.677
l made some coffee.

2:10:56.849 --> 2:10:59.726
-Who's that?
-lt's Harriet.

2:10:59.894 --> 2:11:03.563
l found it in Martin's basement
among his souvenirs.

2:11:03.731 --> 2:11:06.858
No, Martin didn't deny
killing anyone.

2:11:07.944 --> 2:11:11.363
But when l mentioned Harriet,
he was confused.

2:11:11.531 --> 2:11:15.867
He got angry at me because l couldn't
tell him what had happened to her.

2:11:16.035 --> 2:11:17.786
He didn't kill her.

2:11:18.621 --> 2:11:22.707
His father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.

2:11:23.709 --> 2:11:27.462
What if she did somehow manage
to get away?

2:11:28.464 --> 2:11:29.548
l mean, if...

2:11:31.133 --> 2:11:33.510
...she is still alive...

2:11:34.804 --> 2:11:38.974
...then there's only one person in this
family who'd know where she is.

2:12:07.211 --> 2:12:08.420
Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.

2:12:28.733 --> 2:12:30.317
Your turn.

2:12:30.818 --> 2:12:32.277
Right.

2:12:33.112 --> 2:12:34.487
Here.

2:12:51.797 --> 2:12:54.883
Hi. Look, l'm sorry to bother you.

2:12:55.051 --> 2:12:56.134
What do you want?

2:12:56.302 --> 2:12:57.677
-Has no one called you?
-About?

2:12:58.137 --> 2:12:59.638
Your cousin Martin.

2:13:01.265 --> 2:13:04.476
-What about him?
-He died in a car accident...

2:13:04.644 --> 2:13:07.479
...last Thursday. There's going
to be a memorial in Hedestad.

2:13:07.647 --> 2:13:10.273
l'm not interested in any memorial.

2:13:10.441 --> 2:13:12.734
-Well, l understand.
-What do you understand?

2:13:12.902 --> 2:13:15.570
Well, that you don't care
very much for your family.

2:13:15.738 --> 2:13:19.074
-Look, l just thought you should know.
-Now l know.

2:13:29.001 --> 2:13:30.418
How'd it go?

2:13:30.586 --> 2:13:32.420
Okay, l think.

2:13:32.588 --> 2:13:33.922
She's on.

2:13:42.306 --> 2:13:43.807
And she's shopping.

2:13:53.776 --> 2:13:55.902
She's still playing solitaire?

2:13:56.195 --> 2:13:58.279
-And she hasn't called anyone?
-No.

2:13:58.489 --> 2:14:00.699
We have her cell phone too?

2:14:02.034 --> 2:14:04.327
l was so sure
she was gonna lead us to her.

2:14:04.495 --> 2:14:06.871
Put your hand back in my shirt.

2:14:09.834 --> 2:14:12.252
There's only one reason
she hasn't called Harriet.

2:14:12.420 --> 2:14:15.797
She can't. Because Harriet is dead.

2:14:17.591 --> 2:14:19.092
l was just thinking that--

2:14:19.260 --> 2:14:21.428
-Just one second.
-Okay.

2:14:35.234 --> 2:14:37.318
What were you going to say?

2:14:37.820 --> 2:14:41.322
l was just thinking,
there could be one other possibility.

2:14:48.372 --> 2:14:49.748
Well, we could, absolutely.

2:14:52.042 --> 2:14:53.251
What is it now?

2:14:53.419 --> 2:14:56.045
Before he died,
your brother hung me from a hook...

2:14:58.632 --> 2:15:00.091
...Harriet.

2:15:03.262 --> 2:15:04.804
So you sent the flowers.

2:15:04.972 --> 2:15:07.015
Yes, l did.

2:15:07.183 --> 2:15:10.894
We found in the Swedish Family
Registry that Anita was married.

2:15:11.061 --> 2:15:14.105
-But the family never knew, did they?
-No.

2:15:14.273 --> 2:15:17.734
So l'm guessing she then came here
on her married-name passport...

2:15:17.902 --> 2:15:20.153
...and you followed
on her maiden-name passport.

2:15:20.321 --> 2:15:22.697
No, actually,
it was the other way around.

2:15:22.865 --> 2:15:27.035
She thought that it was safer
if l traveled with Spencer myself.

2:15:27.203 --> 2:15:29.496
Well, what did he think about that?

2:15:29.663 --> 2:15:32.665
Nothing. Only that he loved her.

2:15:33.292 --> 2:15:37.295
She said, "lf you love me,
you'll do this and not ask why."

2:15:37.463 --> 2:15:39.047
And he never did.

2:15:39.215 --> 2:15:40.924
And they both died 20 years ago.

2:15:41.091 --> 2:15:42.300
Car accident.

2:15:42.468 --> 2:15:44.886
You found that out too.

2:15:50.059 --> 2:15:51.601
ls that you?

2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:02.028
l was 14 the first time he raped me.

2:16:02.196 --> 2:16:03.321
Martin.

2:16:03.489 --> 2:16:05.114
No, my father.

2:16:05.616 --> 2:16:09.744
Martin only started after he had died.

2:16:09.912 --> 2:16:13.790
-Well, why didn't you tell somebody?
-l did. My mother.

2:16:13.958 --> 2:16:17.043
-Henrik would've done something.
-l almost told him.

2:16:17.211 --> 2:16:19.546
But l was afraid
because of what l'd done.

2:16:20.339 --> 2:16:23.842
-l....
-You still don't understand, do you?

2:16:24.927 --> 2:16:27.679
A year after the first time...

2:16:27.847 --> 2:16:32.350
...and there were many times
during that year...

2:16:33.143 --> 2:16:36.646
...my father got drunker
than usual one night...

2:16:37.731 --> 2:16:43.695
...and he started bragging
about the women he'd killed.

2:16:43.863 --> 2:16:47.031
He quoted from the Bible
as he tore my clothes off.

2:16:47.741 --> 2:16:50.451
He tied a belt around my neck.

2:16:50.619 --> 2:16:53.037
He wanted to kill me.

2:16:54.957 --> 2:16:57.250
l got out of the house.

2:16:58.502 --> 2:16:59.627
l went down to the dock.

2:16:59.962 --> 2:17:02.881
He came staggering after me.

2:17:04.508 --> 2:17:06.676
l could never fight him off
in a small space...

2:17:07.136 --> 2:17:09.721
...but out in the open...

2:17:10.264 --> 2:17:13.224
...l was strong enough
to deal with an old drunk.

2:17:16.729 --> 2:17:18.897
When it was over...

2:17:20.149 --> 2:17:24.986
...I looked up and Martin was
standing there, staring at me.

2:17:25.613 --> 2:17:30.658
And all l'd accomplished was
substitute one for another.

2:17:33.203 --> 2:17:37.832
A couple of months later, Henrik
sent Martin to school in Uppsala.

2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:43.171
And l thought that maybe, just maybe,
the nightmare was finally over.

2:17:44.548 --> 2:17:47.967
And then l saw him
the day of the parade...

2:17:48.427 --> 2:17:50.094
...across the street.

2:17:51.055 --> 2:17:55.558
And l knew
that it would never be over.

2:17:56.018 --> 2:17:57.435
So how did you escape?

2:17:57.728 --> 2:18:00.104
Anita. She....

2:18:00.648 --> 2:18:03.316
She insisted
that l leave everything behind.

2:18:04.109 --> 2:18:08.446
lf l took anything the police might have
suspected that l was still alive.

2:18:09.198 --> 2:18:14.369
As everyone ate dinner, l was no more
than 20 meters away from them.

2:18:15.371 --> 2:18:19.040
l spent the night there.
That's when the search started.

2:18:19.750 --> 2:18:22.377
ln the morning, she came to get me.

2:18:23.671 --> 2:18:27.256
l'd grown up with that bridge
as my link to home...

2:18:28.008 --> 2:18:29.467
...but all l could think is...

2:18:30.678 --> 2:18:32.887
...if l could just
get away from them...

2:18:34.390 --> 2:18:36.641
...just get past the police...

2:18:37.184 --> 2:18:39.268
...then l might be safe.

2:18:42.481 --> 2:18:43.648
And l was.

2:18:44.858 --> 2:18:46.693
Until you showed up.

2:18:48.237 --> 2:18:49.529
You're safe now.

2:18:52.324 --> 2:18:53.992
How did you get away?

2:18:55.744 --> 2:18:57.829
Someone saved me too.

2:19:10.718 --> 2:19:12.176
-How are you feeling?
-l'm fine.

2:19:12.344 --> 2:19:13.928
Thank you, Anna.

2:19:15.431 --> 2:19:18.516
l made you a promise...

2:19:19.852 --> 2:19:23.271
...whether you found anything or not.

2:19:27.026 --> 2:19:29.652
So, what do you have to tell me?

2:19:41.373 --> 2:19:43.082
What's this?

2:20:00.350 --> 2:20:02.393
Hello, Henrik.

2:20:21.330 --> 2:20:24.749
l barely remember Wennerström
working here, much less being fired.

2:20:24.917 --> 2:20:27.043
How could you?
lt was such a long time ago...

2:20:27.211 --> 2:20:30.713
...which is kind of more to the point than
the money he embezzled from you.

2:20:30.881 --> 2:20:33.341
You're referring
to the statute of limitations...

2:20:33.509 --> 2:20:36.552
...but l had no idea this is what
Henrik was holding out.

2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:39.388
lf l had, l never would've let him
bring you up here.

2:20:39.598 --> 2:20:41.099
He wasn't trying to deceive you.

2:20:41.266 --> 2:20:43.976
He knows you can't try somebody
35 years after the event.

2:20:44.144 --> 2:20:47.688
-l like Henrik, but he knows that.
-A man's reputation means something.

2:20:47.856 --> 2:20:50.775
He believes that. He thought
you could destroy Wennerström...

2:20:50.943 --> 2:20:54.028
-...in the court of public opinion.
-The court of public opinion...

2:20:54.196 --> 2:20:57.198
-...celebrates people's bad behavior.
-He's an elderly man.

2:20:57.366 --> 2:20:59.909
He promised me
Wennerström's carcass on a plate.

2:21:00.077 --> 2:21:01.953
This isn't even the plate.

2:21:02.121 --> 2:21:05.373
-l can't do anything with this.
-Yes, of course.

2:21:08.794 --> 2:21:11.129
What happened with Wennerström?

2:21:11.463 --> 2:21:12.630
How did he get you?

2:21:13.382 --> 2:21:18.136
l was stupid. l heard something.
l got it from an anonymous source...

2:21:18.303 --> 2:21:21.430
...who l'm now sure
was one of Wennerström's lackeys.

2:21:22.808 --> 2:21:24.142
lt was fake.

2:21:24.476 --> 2:21:26.811
Which he easily proved in court.

2:21:26.979 --> 2:21:29.647
You were emphatic
that the way l looked into your life...

2:21:29.815 --> 2:21:33.151
...was illegal and immoral. Would you
feel the same about Wennerström?

2:21:33.318 --> 2:21:36.154
-Go on.
-l did some work on my own on him...

2:21:36.321 --> 2:21:38.823
...before you hired me.
l haven't looked at it all...

2:21:38.991 --> 2:21:41.200
...because you
and Harriet-fucking-Vanger...

2:21:41.368 --> 2:21:42.493
...have kept me busy.

2:21:44.329 --> 2:21:45.913
But l may have something.

2:21:46.290 --> 2:21:47.999
You may have something?

2:21:49.334 --> 2:21:50.501
Maybe.

2:21:50.669 --> 2:21:52.837
They launder money
from arms and drug sales...

2:21:53.005 --> 2:21:54.839
...and crime syndicates in Russia.

2:21:55.132 --> 2:21:58.176
And that money accounts for all
but 5 percent of his holdings.

2:21:58.343 --> 2:22:00.720
The rest ends up in accounts
in the Cayman lslands.

2:22:00.929 --> 2:22:03.848
-And how do you know this?
-This time you don't want to know.

2:22:04.016 --> 2:22:06.142
This time l do want to know.

2:22:06.810 --> 2:22:08.227
l have access to his computer.

2:22:08.854 --> 2:22:12.023
-And his accountant's and lawyer's.
-And how do you have that?

2:22:12.191 --> 2:22:14.025
l could've gotten it from a source
inside the company.

2:22:14.193 --> 2:22:16.027
-You didn't.
-But that's what you'll say.

2:22:16.195 --> 2:22:17.987
And what will you say to me?

2:22:18.155 --> 2:22:20.239
Well, that depends
if you really want to know.

2:22:20.407 --> 2:22:23.367
l do.
Mikael, how did you get access?

2:22:35.380 --> 2:22:37.548
Financial journalist
Mikael Blomkvist...

2:22:37.716 --> 2:22:40.218
...who, this time last year
was convicted of libel...

2:22:40.385 --> 2:22:41.844
...in a Stockholm courtroom...

2:22:42.012 --> 2:22:44.347
...doesn't seem to have learned
from his mistakes.

2:22:44.514 --> 2:22:46.098
Or maybe he has.

2:22:46.266 --> 2:22:49.393
In the current issue of Millennium
magazine, he now charges...

2:22:49.561 --> 2:22:52.230
...the company that sued him,
the Wennerström Group...

2:22:52.397 --> 2:22:53.564
The shit hits the fan.

2:22:53.732 --> 2:22:56.567
...of criminal activities
on a global scale.

2:22:56.735 --> 2:22:58.027
What happens now?

2:22:58.195 --> 2:23:01.364
Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta,
which won't wash.

2:23:01.531 --> 2:23:04.075
The police will investigate,
Fl will investigate.

2:23:04.243 --> 2:23:06.702
lt'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.

2:23:07.496 --> 2:23:09.205
You think?

2:23:09.373 --> 2:23:10.414
Probably not.

2:23:11.124 --> 2:23:12.917
These guys never do.

2:23:25.180 --> 2:23:26.264
What's wrong with you?

2:23:26.431 --> 2:23:28.849
-lt's embarrassing.
-Tell me.

2:23:29.017 --> 2:23:30.559
l need to borrow some money.

2:23:31.603 --> 2:23:33.104
Fifty thousand.

2:23:35.107 --> 2:23:38.484
l have a chance to make an investment.
lt's a smart, safe investment.

2:23:38.652 --> 2:23:41.946
-l really don't think l've got 50,000.
-Yes, you do.

2:23:42.114 --> 2:23:45.533
You have 65,000
in your two accounts.

2:23:45.701 --> 2:23:47.868
l'm sorry that l know that.

2:23:49.454 --> 2:23:51.163
You'll get the money back,
l promise.

2:23:52.541 --> 2:23:55.793
Okay.

2:23:57.129 --> 2:23:58.879
You want a coffee?

2:24:02.467 --> 2:24:06.971
These allegations, like the last one
from this so-called journalist...

2:24:07.139 --> 2:24:08.973
...are as ridiculous
as they are untrue.

2:24:09.141 --> 2:24:12.643
l'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court
again, and l'm looking forward to it.

2:24:12.811 --> 2:24:14.186
What about his documentation?

2:24:14.354 --> 2:24:16.314
Fabricated. All of it.

2:24:16.481 --> 2:24:20.484
The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite
as certain as Mr. Wennerström of that.

2:24:20.652 --> 2:24:23.654
lf a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist
alleges proves to be true...

2:24:23.822 --> 2:24:26.490
...not only will there be
a securities investigation...

2:24:26.658 --> 2:24:28.826
...but an organized-crime inquiry
as well.

2:24:28.994 --> 2:24:30.578
Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.

2:24:30.746 --> 2:24:33.372
And we can't force him to.
But we can look for them.

2:24:33.582 --> 2:24:36.334
-Beginning where?
-Those closest to Mr. Wennerström.

2:24:36.501 --> 2:24:39.670
Only someone in the inner circle
of a corporation like this...

2:24:39.838 --> 2:24:41.714
...has access to this kind
of information.

2:24:41.882 --> 2:24:44.216
Mr. Wennerström isn't available
for comment...

2:24:44.384 --> 2:24:46.177
...but l'm happy
to answer questions.

2:24:46.345 --> 2:24:48.512
-Where is he?
-At home, l imagine.

2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:50.890
No, he's not.
Has he left the country?

2:24:51.099 --> 2:24:52.600
l don't think so.

2:25:03.528 --> 2:25:05.404
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

2:25:14.122 --> 2:25:17.666
Welcome to the Dolder Grand, miss.
May l have your passport, please?

2:25:45.237 --> 2:25:46.612
With his failure to appear...

2:25:46.780 --> 2:25:49.073
...before a Security Exchange
Commission panel...

2:25:49.241 --> 2:25:52.576
...a warrant has been issued
for the Wennerström Group CEO.

2:25:52.744 --> 2:25:54.745
l can confirm that he left Sweden...

2:25:54.913 --> 2:25:57.581
...on a private jet
that landed in Paris last week.

2:25:58.750 --> 2:26:00.668
Whether he's still there,
we don't know.

2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:03.712
He can be anywhere by now.

2:26:15.100 --> 2:26:16.475
Thank you.

2:26:18.270 --> 2:26:21.230
l have accounts at Bank
of Kroenenfeld, Cayman lslands.

2:26:21.398 --> 2:26:23.607
l'd like to transfer them
and convert to bonds.

2:26:23.942 --> 2:26:26.944
-Naturally, you have the clearing codes.
-Naturally.

2:26:28.113 --> 2:26:29.864
How many accounts
will you transfer?

2:26:30.031 --> 2:26:31.115
Thirty.

2:26:32.993 --> 2:26:36.287
-This will take some time.
-You will receive 4 percent commission.

2:26:37.122 --> 2:26:39.457
-l will.
-Then it won't be a waste of it.

2:26:42.586 --> 2:26:44.837
A Swedish tourist vacationing
here in Barbados...

2:26:45.005 --> 2:26:48.799
...says he knows where fugitive
financier Hans-Erik Wennerström is:

2:26:48.967 --> 2:26:51.510
Here, in this Caribbean island's
capital, Bridgetown.

2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:55.473
Police released this photo and
believe it is the disgraced billionaire.

2:27:10.864 --> 2:27:13.782
How many of these would you like
to convert for deposit?

2:27:13.950 --> 2:27:15.367
All 50, into five accounts.

2:27:30.258 --> 2:27:31.884
Yes. That looks correct.

2:28:44.416 --> 2:28:47.710
The man who is now being called
Sweden's Charles Ponzi...

2:28:47.877 --> 2:28:50.087
...may no longer have a country
to call home...

2:28:50.255 --> 2:28:52.131
...but does have enough money
to buy one.

2:28:52.340 --> 2:28:54.758
According to the lnternational
Banking Commission...

2:28:54.926 --> 2:28:57.803
...Wennerström, a week after
the Millennium article appeared...

2:28:57.971 --> 2:29:00.598
...on newsstands,
began emptying accounts...

2:29:00.765 --> 2:29:03.392
...at Bank of Kroenenfeld
in the Cayman lslands.

2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:06.270
That money,
approximately 2 billion euros...

2:29:06.438 --> 2:29:08.897
...was then spread over
a number of accounts...

2:29:09.065 --> 2:29:12.109
...with the help of this confederate,
seen here in Zurich.

2:29:16.448 --> 2:29:18.073
-Hey.
-Hey.

2:29:18.241 --> 2:29:20.367
-The money l borrowed.
-Already?

2:29:22.537 --> 2:29:25.164
Thank you.

2:29:28.418 --> 2:29:29.501
No, l quit.

2:29:31.421 --> 2:29:32.796
lt was a good investment?

2:29:33.798 --> 2:29:35.132
lt was okay.

2:29:36.134 --> 2:29:37.301
What are you doing later?

2:29:38.303 --> 2:29:39.887
l'm seeing my daughter.

2:29:40.180 --> 2:29:41.639
Okay.

2:29:43.141 --> 2:29:44.475
You look nice.

2:29:46.770 --> 2:29:48.812
lt's Christmas again.

2:29:49.773 --> 2:29:51.565
l'll see you soon.

2:29:59.491 --> 2:30:01.659
Mr. Wennerström
won the libel case....

2:30:01.826 --> 2:30:03.827
You got that call in the office.

2:30:16.424 --> 2:30:18.133
l miss our meetings.

2:30:19.719 --> 2:30:22.012
l'm sure you don't. Why would you?

2:30:22.180 --> 2:30:24.682
l was always such
a headache for you.

2:30:25.016 --> 2:30:28.352
Never showing up with good news,
only problems.

2:30:29.646 --> 2:30:30.938
l have good news now.

2:30:31.189 --> 2:30:32.856
l made a friend.

2:30:33.858 --> 2:30:36.026
l mean, one that you'd approve of.

2:30:39.989 --> 2:30:41.407
l'm happy.

2:30:42.200 --> 2:30:45.035
A man who authorities here
in Marbella have confirmed...

2:30:45.203 --> 2:30:49.581
...is fugitive Hans-Erik Wennerström,
shot three times in the head...

2:30:49.749 --> 2:30:52.501
...in what police are calling
a classic gangland execution.

2:30:52.669 --> 2:30:54.670
The investigation
into Wennerström's ties...

2:30:54.838 --> 2:30:59.216
...to crime organizations worldwide
will now turn into speculation.

2:30:59.384 --> 2:31:02.428
Which of them caught up with him
before Swedish authorities could?

2:31:02.595 --> 2:31:05.764
Wennerström spent the last days
of his flamboyant life....

2:31:16.985 --> 2:31:19.695
-lt's nice.
-Your father?

2:31:19.863 --> 2:31:22.281
-A friend.
-Must be a very good friend.

2:32:04.949 --> 2:32:06.575
-We're late.
-Fashionably late.
