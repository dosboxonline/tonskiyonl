00:01.305 --> 00:03.003
[Dr. Lim] Previously on
The Good Doctor...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.656
You've always
taken after your father.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.180
-Why is that a bad thing?
-It isn't.

00:06.223 --> 00:08.138
He was driven,
and he was brilliant.

00:08.182 --> 00:12.055
I wish that he had been able
to ask for help.

00:12.099 --> 00:15.058
And insert the tube
into the vacutainer.

00:15.102 --> 00:18.018
And you've just passed
phlebotomy 101.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.412
Oh, God.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.501
[Shaun] Stop talking.
You're distracting me.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.199
[Charlie] I wanted
to impress you.
It's a top journal--

00:25.242 --> 00:26.287
[Shaun] Get out of OR!

00:27.810 --> 00:29.551
Charlie Lukaitis
won't listen to me.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.335
I cannot work with her anymore.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.642
Apparently, she can't
work with you, either.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.861
She filed a complaint
against you.

00:35.905 --> 00:38.081
-[Asher] What's going on?
-I've asked them to leave.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.343
He's a Jew, too.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.477
A gay one, in fact.
And I'm calling the cops.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.956
[line ringing]

00:44.000 --> 00:46.698
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Now go get engaged.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.052
[grunts]

01:00.190 --> 01:02.758
[somber organ music plays]

01:09.547 --> 01:10.679
Are you okay?

01:12.115 --> 01:13.073
Yes.

01:14.596 --> 01:15.814
I am meeting with HR

01:15.858 --> 01:17.642
to discuss Charlie's
complaint this afternoon.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.386
Okay.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.693
It's just been three days

01:24.736 --> 01:26.303
and you've barely
mentioned Asher.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.654
I've read that grief reactions
are delayed

01:29.698 --> 01:31.917
in people with autism.

01:31.961 --> 01:35.747
When a loss finally hits,
it can be really intense,

01:35.791 --> 01:37.967
sometimes even overwhelming.

01:39.402 --> 01:42.406
If that happens,
find me anytime.

01:45.453 --> 01:46.932
Okay.

02:09.477 --> 02:12.784
Asher and I
came from different worlds.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.701
I am a devout Christian
from Oakland,

02:16.745 --> 02:21.663
and he was an Orthodox Jew
turned atheist from Brooklyn.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.319
But when we met at St. Bons,

02:26.711 --> 02:29.410
he became my closest friend.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.892
Asher had a way
of making you feel like

02:33.936 --> 02:36.895
he saw the best version of you,

02:36.939 --> 02:38.941
but he still loved you
at your worst.

02:41.944 --> 02:44.338
He was also one of the most
courageous people I knew.

02:45.991 --> 02:48.298
Brave enough to leave behind
the people he loved

02:49.865 --> 02:51.692
to be the person he knew
he was inside.

02:53.477 --> 02:56.524
He was stubborn
and opinionated,

02:56.567 --> 03:00.615
[chuckles] had a strange
affinity for grandpa sweaters,

03:00.658 --> 03:03.748
made a crazy-good margarita,

03:03.792 --> 03:08.188
and he was just
so, so much fun.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.237
[blinds opening]

03:14.281 --> 03:15.325
I've made breakfast.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.718
I'm not hungry.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.547
You're barely eating.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.289
I know. I'm exhausted.
I couldn't sleep last night.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.681
I know.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.814
I've heard you up
every night since...

03:28.120 --> 03:30.122
Isn't your friend's
funeral today?

03:30.166 --> 03:32.647
Yeah. I-I think I'm coming
down with something.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.126
I'm gonna do a swab at work.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.087
I don't think you're sick.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.176
You should talk to a therapist.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.438
[scoffs] I just need sleep.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.096
I have to tell you something
about your father.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.403
And I should have told you this
years ago,

03:49.446 --> 03:50.578
but I promised him that I--

03:50.621 --> 03:52.710
Mom, I cannot
do this right now.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.234
-[cell phone chimes]
-You idolized him,

03:54.277 --> 03:57.324
and he never wanted you
to see him vulnerable.

03:57.367 --> 04:00.501
You won't listen to me,
but you will answer a text?

04:00.544 --> 04:02.024
Well, it could be work.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.374
-Honey, your father--
-Ma, I gotta go.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.376
[down-tempo music plays]

04:09.771 --> 04:12.687
He was one of the most
considerate people I knew

04:12.730 --> 04:14.166
and a damn good doctor.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.300
He knew
what the patient wanted,

04:17.344 --> 04:18.822
so he fought for it.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.825
He made it happen.

04:20.869 --> 04:23.001
But that was Asher...

04:23.045 --> 04:25.090
standing up for his beliefs.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.224
Even if it cost him his family,

04:29.660 --> 04:31.836
even if it got him in trouble,

04:31.880 --> 04:35.013
Asher always did
what he thought was right.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.149
[voice breaking]
And now he's gone...

04:52.683 --> 04:57.034
...because of a couple of
ignorant, hateful monsters.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.910
They knew
one thing about Asher.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.041
One thing.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.478
And they killed him for it.

05:04.521 --> 05:07.785
Left him lying there
bleeding on the pavement.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.005
And those animals,
they get to live.

05:10.788 --> 05:11.963
And now he's dead.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.704
And I hate them.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.882
I hate them
for taking my friend.

05:17.926 --> 05:21.886
[cell phones chiming
and buzzing]

05:25.281 --> 05:27.979
Have to go. We all do.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.242
[chiming and buzzing continues]

05:30.286 --> 05:31.722
Excuse me.

05:40.165 --> 05:43.212
A guy drove his car
through a crowd
at San Jose SpringFest.

05:43.255 --> 05:44.996
-Accident?
-Doesn't look that way.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.389
How badly are we outnumbered?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.478
Still early intel,
but it looks pretty bad.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.045
Activate
Mass Casualty Event Protocol.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.307
Alerts are out. ORs are up.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.222
-Elective patients
are canceled.
-Good.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.311
We have eight surgeons away
at the Cleveland Conference.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.444
I need a surgeon.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.533
Severe head injury,
hypoxia, and seizures.

06:00.751 --> 06:02.449
[sirens wailing in distance]

06:04.320 --> 06:06.148
Skull fracture,
brain herniation with CSF leak.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.367
I'll take him up.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.107
Call Dixon.
He's the backup Team Leader.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.979
-He's in Cleveland, too.
-[sighs]

06:11.022 --> 06:13.198
-Put Murphy in charge
until I get back.
-You sure?

06:13.242 --> 06:15.375
Today's gonna be messy,
especially after losing Asher.

06:16.811 --> 06:17.942
You'll help him.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.335
Shaun won't let emotions
get in the way.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.206
[sirens continue wailing]

06:23.600 --> 06:26.342
[theme music playing]

06:33.610 --> 06:34.829
[dramatic music plays]

06:34.872 --> 06:37.179
Dispatch said we're getting
over 25 patients,

06:37.222 --> 06:39.007
many critical.
First wave just arrived.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.225
Lim's gonna be
in the OR for a while.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.966
SpringFest was
six blocks from our house.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.054
You were gonna take Eden.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.186
I know it's horrible,

06:44.229 --> 06:45.230
but these things are
pretty rare.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.058
Are they? Look at Asher.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.148
Are you okay?

06:50.192 --> 06:51.585
You seemed pretty angry
at the funeral.

06:51.628 --> 06:52.716
Seems pretty reasonable.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.414
[paramedic] Watch your backs.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.373
Do you need me to slap you?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.635
I hope not.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.463
You gonna have a problem
working with Dr. Murphy?

07:00.507 --> 07:01.464
I hope not.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.858
Okay.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.468
Doctors Park, Kalu, and Allen,

07:05.512 --> 07:07.296
you'll be treating
Red Tag patients.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.298
Dr. Reznick,
you're with the ER physicians
on Yellow Tag patients.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.821
Dom, you're on Green Tags
in the waiting room.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.127
Green Tags?

07:12.170 --> 07:13.868
Red Tags are
urgent surgical patients.

07:13.911 --> 07:15.522
Yellow, urgent non-surgical.

07:15.565 --> 07:16.697
And Green, minor injuries.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.307
Minor injuries. I can do that.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.527
What about me?

07:20.570 --> 07:21.876
You're on Black Tags.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.486
But they're already dead.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.445
Yes, every Black Tag patient
needs a pronouncement checklist

07:25.488 --> 07:27.055
completed before they can be
moved to the morgue.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.840
Those bodies are taking up
valuable space.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.233
It feels like
you're punishing me

07:31.276 --> 07:32.713
for filing an HR complaint
against you.

07:32.756 --> 07:37.065
I am not. Not working with you
is an unintended benefit.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.415
That's not how you're gonna
get her to drop the complaint.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.504
And you're gonna need
all the help you can get today.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.854
Yes, and I need more surgeons.
Like you.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.508
I'm not available. Remember?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.597
You have experience,
and I am very short-staffed.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.294
You're short-staffed
everywhere you look.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.731
Give me Yellow Tags.

07:50.774 --> 07:51.949
Bay six.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.691
I'm taking her for an Ex-lap.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.258
Jordan needs you.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.652
[paramedic 2]
I've got a red tag.
I need a surgeon.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.089
Flora, blunt abdominal trauma,
40 weeks pregnant.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.308
This is Ken,
massive flail chest.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.875
I need a surgeon now.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.224
There are only two of us.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.878
Move them to adjoining bays.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.967
She is critically hypoxic.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.273
My patient's bleeding out.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.840
My guy's here because of him.

08:12.883 --> 08:15.407
Ken jumped in front of the car,
saved a little girl.

08:15.451 --> 08:19.063
-This the driver?
-Yeah. His leg's a mess.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.718
Femoral artery's lacerated.
Tourniquet there.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.807
-[machine beeps]
-Pressure's critically low.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.069
She must be bleeding
into her abdomen.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.984
FAST ultrasound.
What do you see, Dr. Allen?

08:27.028 --> 08:28.508
Massive cardiac contusions,

08:28.551 --> 08:30.988
pulmonary artery trunk tear,
lung lacs...

08:31.032 --> 08:32.163
Okay, those are
terminal injuries.

08:32.207 --> 08:33.904
This patient needs a cut down

08:33.948 --> 08:35.558
to clamp his common
femoral artery.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.604
I can cross clamp Ken's aorta.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.996
That won't fix his heart.
He is a Black Tag.

08:40.040 --> 08:41.738
He risked his life
to save a kid.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.434
That is very heroic.
He will be dead soon.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.741
You can still save the driver.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.308
We should try to do
everything we can.

08:46.351 --> 08:47.744
You have. Move on.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.879
She's in cardiopulmonary
failure.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.228
[alarm blaring]

08:54.838 --> 08:58.102
She's...dying.
I can't save her,

08:58.146 --> 08:59.234
but I can save the baby.

Prep trauma one
for a C-section.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.021
Dr. Allen, the leg. Now.

They're unhurt, but their dad
was just brought in.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.039
Can you check on the status?

09:25.086 --> 09:26.261
I don't know where to start.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.917
Start with the patients
on the left side of the room

09:29.960 --> 09:31.309
and work your way
over to the right.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.924
Hi. I'm Dom. How can I help?

09:43.408 --> 09:45.280
There's a uterine rupture here.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.847
Fetal decels are critical.

[baby crying]

09:51.286 --> 09:52.766
Baby looks good.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.550
Dr. Murphy,
we can take it from here.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.552
Get a Black Tag for the mom.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.038
I need a thoracotomy tray.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.127
I might be able to save
the mother, too.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.610
[alarms blaring,
sirens wailing]

10:12.742 --> 10:14.265
That's two more units of O neg.

last bleeder. Bipolar.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.675
[nurse] There's just
so much vascular damage.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.285
[Dr. Lim] I think I have
good profusion.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.116
Let's close the dura.

is spiking.

herniating.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.523
She's minutes
from anoxic brain injury.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.656
There.
In the pulmonary trunk...

10:56.699 --> 10:58.875
Dr. Murphy, four more Red Tag
patients just came in.

10:58.919 --> 10:59.876
There it is.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.010
Amniotic fluid
entered her bloodstream.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.012

23:16.569 --> 23:17.918
Maybe that's just what I hoped.

23:21.051 --> 23:24.315
[crying] I'm angry, too,
at him.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.709
How could he have done this?

23:26.753 --> 23:29.538
And I'm angry at myself
for not knowing
what he was capable of.

23:30.931 --> 23:32.106
I wish you would help him.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.213
[nurse Lashelle]
He's down a liter.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.128
[Dr. Glassman]
Give me two units.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.651
[monitor beeping]

23:59.176 --> 24:01.962
Okay, here we go
into the triangle of death.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.878
So many things can go wrong.

24:04.921 --> 24:06.140
[nurse Lashelle]
You want to talk it out?

24:09.099 --> 24:11.754
[Dr. Glassman]
Clamp the porta hepatis.

24:11.798 --> 24:15.105
Ligate the left hepatic
to control the bleeding.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.237
Remove the left lobe--

24:16.280 --> 24:17.934
-Dr. Glassman?
-Yes.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.894
-I need you to look at
Ethan's rhythm strip.
-Is it urgent?

24:20.937 --> 24:23.200
He's in sinus rhythm,
but I noticed a run of PVCs.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.855
[Dr. Glassman]
Well, keep him monitored.
I'll check it when I'm done.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.118
But a half hour ago,
he had another run.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.946
[Dr. Glassman] Didn't I
tell you to check
every 45 minutes?

24:29.990 --> 24:31.470
I'm being thorough.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.559
[Dr. Glassman]
PVCs are fairly common.

24:33.602 --> 24:37.258
Can I do a 12 lead
and electrolytes?

24:37.301 --> 24:38.607
[Dr. Glassman]
That's a good idea, Charlie.

24:38.651 --> 24:40.217
Run it past Dr. Paxton
in cardiology.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.436
[Charlie] Mm.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.308
[Dr. Glassman] Okay.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.747
Clamp the porta hepatis.

24:47.790 --> 24:51.620
Ligate the left hepatic
to control the bleeding.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.627
[Dr. Lim] I need
threaded pins here
to stabilize the pelvis.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.808
[JL] What is it?

25:05.852 --> 25:07.810
[Dr. Lim] He looks
a lot like Asher.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.247
[JL] Maybe a little.

25:11.901 --> 25:12.946
[alarm blaring]

25:12.989 --> 25:14.513
Blood pressure's dropping.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.297
[Dr. Lim] There's bleeding
in the pelvis. Vascular clips.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.081
[alarm continues blaring]

25:27.047 --> 25:28.439
Okay, your pressure's
pretty high.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.311
I still feel my heart racing.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.747
That sounds normal.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.271
Maybe that doctor lady
should do another EKG.

25:34.315 --> 25:38.058
I learned about
mindfulness-based meditation
last semester in psych class.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.233
I think that could help you.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.714
I'm here for medical care,
not yoga.

25:45.935 --> 25:48.677
-Is that bad?
-It's just a little nosebleed.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.507
Pinch hard.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.422
I've never had
a nosebleed like this.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.556
I need a doctor in here. Hello?

25:57.599 --> 25:58.992
Why is it not stopping?

26:01.385 --> 26:02.909
Okay, 500cc bolus.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.175
Get her to OR three
with Dr. Lee.

26:08.218 --> 26:09.393
I need to hand off to a doctor.

26:09.437 --> 26:10.569
One minute.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.790
Morgan can close this
when she's free.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.183
Two more Red Tags
in the corridor.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.837
-Have Jared take them.
-Dr. Kalu's still in the OR.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.360
Then get Asher.

26:19.403 --> 26:20.404
Asher?

26:25.279 --> 26:27.586
Oh. He's dead.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.415
One of the Red Tags
has a chest impalement.

26:31.459 --> 26:32.678
He could go south soon.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.941
Doc, my crew
has an urgent pick-up.

26:34.984 --> 26:38.640
Dr. Quao needs
an anesthesiologist,
but they're all tied up.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.250
I need you to look at
Ethan's EKG.

26:40.294 --> 26:41.730
There are some
unusual patterns.

26:41.774 --> 26:43.819
Dr. Glassman
is supervising you.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.429
He's busy.
He sent me to Dr. Paxton.

26:45.473 --> 26:46.605
He thinks this is normal,

26:46.648 --> 26:48.215
but I think Ethan
is gonna die again.

26:48.258 --> 26:49.608
Okay.

26:54.743 --> 26:57.006
Dr. Paxton was right
and I am very busy.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.878
If you compare them
over the two hours,
you'll see the clusters.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.444
-Sorry.
-Quao really needs an answer.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.752
And that Red Tag
needs a surgeon.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.232
Okay.

27:05.275 --> 27:06.929
-Look, two hours ago--
-Okay.

-Dr. Murphy?

27:09.758 --> 27:13.327
Dr. Murphy,
Quao really needs an answer.

27:13.370 --> 27:16.373

we have an urgent pick-up.

-[sound normalizes]
-Find Dr. Park.
We need a new Team Leader.

27:18.288 --> 27:20.116
Wait.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.424
Dr. Murphy, I see
you're covering your ears.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.295
-[sound muffles]
-I think you're feeling
very overwhelmed.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.949
I would be, too,
with people coming up to me,

27:26.993 --> 27:28.516
bombarding me with questions.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.344
But maybe it would help
if you broke it down...

-...step by step,

27:32.955 --> 27:34.783

27:43.139 --> 27:45.359
We can't wait any longer.
Go find Dr. Park.

27:50.494 --> 27:53.149
Get the plastics resident to
close for Dr. Park in OR one.

27:53.193 --> 27:54.803
and send Dr. Park
to the corridor patient.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.805
EMT can hand off to Dr. Steffy
in the procedure room.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.067
And the anesthesiologist
in trauma five

27:58.111 --> 27:59.852
should be finishing soon.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.027
Come with me now.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.419
We are going to save
your patient's life.

28:07.076 --> 28:10.340
He has a ventricular aneurysm.
His heart's going to rupture.

28:10.384 --> 28:12.299
There's no empty OR
and this can't wait.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.170
-I will have to operate.
-Here?

28:14.214 --> 28:16.477
-It's not sterile.
-I can treat an infection.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.044
I can't do anything for him
if he's dead.

Okay. You have to help me.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.190
It seems like
it's slowing down.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.106

28:38.238 --> 28:40.066
This is a posterior epistaxis.

in the back of your nose.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.375
You're bleeding out.
I need help!

Look, I gotta go
find you a doctor.

28:46.768 --> 28:47.987

29:32.553 --> 29:34.207
There are no Dacron sutures
in the ER,

29:34.250 --> 29:36.209
but I think the Teflon
should be a suitable
replacement.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.601
Yes, it is.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.342
-[woman] I need a surgeon!
-Is that the aneurysm?

Yes, and we're too late.
It's already ruptured.

-It would be catastrophic.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.570
Oh.

32:43.613 --> 32:46.965
What were you gonna tell me
earlier today about Dad?

32:49.315 --> 32:51.317
[clears throat]

32:51.360 --> 32:53.493
He was an amazing man.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.103
Love of my life, really.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.280
And he had clinical depression.

32:59.455 --> 33:00.543
What?

33:00.587 --> 33:02.545
He traveled for work,

33:02.589 --> 33:07.072
but some of those trips,
they were hospital stays.

33:08.551 --> 33:11.032
And he never
wanted you to know.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.730
-Why?
-Because...

33:13.774 --> 33:15.732
he loved being your hero.

33:15.776 --> 33:19.562
He loved being a success,
being immersed in his work.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.131
But when those things
weren't propping him up...

33:25.090 --> 33:26.395
he would get lost.

33:28.093 --> 33:32.314
And I know
that I am far from exciting.

33:32.358 --> 33:35.752
No, you weren't all wrong
about me.

33:35.796 --> 33:37.493
More than anything,

33:37.537 --> 33:41.628
I have found fulfillment
from the small connections

33:41.671 --> 33:43.760
that I share with people...

33:43.804 --> 33:47.808
like making cookies
for my daughter.

33:49.897 --> 33:55.294
He would have been so mad
that I told you,

33:55.337 --> 33:58.079
but I realized that
I couldn't keep telling you

33:58.123 --> 33:59.994
that I was worried about you

34:00.038 --> 34:03.215
without telling the truth
about why.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.957
I loved your dad,

34:08.219 --> 34:10.918
almost as much as I love you.

I am so proud
of who you have become.

to end up like him.

You just saved him once.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.928
I may have been wrong
about you.

You might make
an adequate surgeon one day.
