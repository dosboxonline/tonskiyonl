02:24.737 --> 02:28.032
And this display is all that's
left of CONTROL, a secret spy agency...

02:28.199 --> 02:31.869
...which once battled against
the criminal syndicate known as KAOS.

02:32.036 --> 02:34.788
CONTROL was disbanded
at the end of the Cold War.

02:35.206 --> 02:38.209
Okay, up next, an exhibit...

03:44.649 --> 03:48.945
Judy, the elevator is still doing that thing
where it drops really fast.

03:49.112 --> 03:50.780
Are you sure Maintenance fixed that?

03:50.947 --> 03:52.282
Let me check.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.200
Yep, they fixed it.

03:56.119 --> 03:57.454
See you later.

04:00.498 --> 04:02.291
- Hey, Max.
Agent 50.

04:03.792 --> 04:05.920
16 floors down,
how'd a fly even get in here?

04:06.086 --> 04:07.463
- Hey, Max.
- Max!

04:07.630 --> 04:08.964
Hey, Larabee, 91.

04:09.131 --> 04:12.676
Yeah, big day. Could be
your last chance to push a pencil.

04:12.843 --> 04:14.678
Field-agent test results are due.

04:14.845 --> 04:18.974
Oh. Is that today?
I wasn't really thinking about it.

04:19.141 --> 04:21.560
Can you imagine Max as an agent?
Little suit, little shoes.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.521
Uh-oh. Two-nerd pile-up.

04:25.856 --> 04:26.878
- Move!
- Ow!

04:26.913 --> 04:27.900
- Move!
- Ow!

04:28.150 --> 04:30.945
Pretty boys. Nothing but empty suits.

04:31.111 --> 04:34.156
- Good morning, Bruce, Lloyd.
- Why would you wanna be an agent?

04:34.323 --> 04:38.077
I mean, lab guys like us, analysts
like you, we're the real soldiers.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.621
We're the true guardians
of freedom and democracy.

04:40.788 --> 04:43.249
And I hear we're getting
a new cappuccino machine.

04:43.415 --> 04:44.833
No, that's only for agents.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.585
Oh.

04:58.806 --> 05:01.392
Hey, Agent 23 is back.

05:10.692 --> 05:12.527
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

05:13.194 --> 05:15.113
- Welcome back, 23.
- Maxie.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.156
So how was the assassination?

05:17.323 --> 05:20.118
Maxie, you know assassinations
are specifically prohibited...

05:20.285 --> 05:22.161
...by executive order 12333.

05:25.957 --> 05:27.292
23, you kill me.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.711
- I could if I wanted to.
- Yes, you... Oh. Oh!

05:29.878 --> 05:32.380
Did you see that face he made? Scary.

05:35.383 --> 05:38.720
Six months' work. 18 million dollars.

05:40.096 --> 05:42.056
Fricking agents, man.

05:42.223 --> 05:43.558
Come on, let's see it.

05:43.725 --> 05:48.521
A lot of chatter in this region
involves nuclear material.

05:48.688 --> 05:52.233
You may remember
from page 627 of my last report...

05:52.400 --> 05:55.194
...that there has been an uptick
in KAOS interest in nukes.

05:57.405 --> 06:00.241
To wit, I offer
the following conversation.

06:00.408 --> 06:02.577
What are you doing? Are you texting?

06:02.744 --> 06:05.997
Yeah, letting my fiancÃ©e know
we won't be able to get married in June.

06:06.164 --> 06:07.749
I'll still be in this meeting.

06:08.666 --> 06:10.251
Can I see that a second?
- Yeah.

06:10.667 --> 06:11.710
That's great.

06:13.045 --> 06:15.088
That's weird. You lost your signal.

06:15.255 --> 06:17.257
Sorry to interrupt, Maxie, go ahead.

06:17.758 --> 06:20.010
Next time use your own damn phone.

06:21.345 --> 06:23.430
Good morning, men. No, offense, Karen.

06:23.597 --> 06:24.890
Snappy tie.

06:25.057 --> 06:27.851
Sorry I'm late, but I just came out
of a budget meeting...

06:28.018 --> 06:32.022
...with our incredibly abrasive, dismissive
and sarcastic vice president.

06:32.189 --> 06:33.357
It's no problem.

06:33.523 --> 06:38.528
I have obtained a snippet,
at great risk to a busboy in Balahd.

06:42.282 --> 06:44.535
"Aftab, how is your coffee?"

06:45.494 --> 06:48.372
"Good, Dalip, it's decaf.

06:49.206 --> 06:50.499
How is yours?"

06:51.708 --> 06:53.794
"It is good also.

06:54.169 --> 06:56.505
How is your muffin?"

06:58.048 --> 06:59.424
Powerful stuff.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.261
So "muffin," then, is a code word?

07:02.427 --> 07:04.096
No, it is comfort food...

07:04.263 --> 07:07.140
...and quite frankly, more
fattening than most people realize.

07:07.307 --> 07:08.684
Which begs the question...

07:08.850 --> 07:13.021
...why would two
hardened KAOS agents...

07:13.188 --> 07:15.982
...risk the carbs?

07:16.983 --> 07:19.485
Because they are under
a great deal of stress.

07:19.652 --> 07:21.320
- Hence the decaf.
- For Aftab, yes.

07:21.487 --> 07:23.865
Dalip takes his full-strength. Why?

07:24.031 --> 07:26.826
Because he has been sleeping
on the couch for three days...

07:26.993 --> 07:30.329
...because he called his sister-in-law
a "leathery hag."

07:30.496 --> 07:31.914
People often say things
in anger they don't really mean.

07:31.949 --> 07:33.332
People often say things
in anger they don't really mean.

07:33.499 --> 07:37.503
Leathery hag, fat cow, ungrateful whore.

07:37.670 --> 07:42.508
Just words, really, that shouldn't
be used against you in a custody hearing.

07:43.009 --> 07:46.262
Let it go, man. Those kids
don't even look like you.

07:46.721 --> 07:48.347
Can we put a pin in this, please...

07:48.514 --> 07:51.309
...and go back to Max's
extraordinarily detailed report?

07:51.475 --> 07:53.227
Thank you, Chief. All I'm saying is...

07:53.394 --> 07:56.272
...that until we understand
that our enemies are also human...

07:56.439 --> 07:58.107
...we will never defeat them.

07:58.274 --> 08:03.946
Yes, they are bad guys, but that
is what they do, not who they are.

08:04.238 --> 08:06.032
Let's continue listening...

08:06.199 --> 08:10.036
...and bear in mind that the next
100 pages can get a little bit dry.

08:10.203 --> 08:12.038
Come on...

08:23.590 --> 08:26.593
Easy, Durat! This stuff is radioactive.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.720
One slip-up, and it's "ka-fricking-boom!"

08:28.887 --> 08:30.055
Shtarker.

08:31.389 --> 08:35.309
This is KAOS.
We don't "ka-fricking-boom" here.

08:35.809 --> 08:37.437
Sorry, Mr. Siegfried.

08:37.604 --> 08:41.066
Get it in the truck,
and let's burn this place to the ground.

08:41.232 --> 08:43.735
But if we have what we want,
why burn the building?

08:51.076 --> 08:53.370
Any more questions?

09:17.435 --> 09:18.603
Missed me!

09:20.939 --> 09:24.024
All right! All right! I'm out!

09:24.191 --> 09:26.193
He was lying, Max. It was a good shot.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.653
Thanks.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.531
I am so sick of training.
I wanna get out in the field.

09:30.698 --> 09:34.451
Give it up, 23! It's just you
and Maxi-pad against the six of us.

09:34.618 --> 09:37.872
Oh, gee, Maxi-pad,
I've never heard that one before!

09:38.289 --> 09:40.291
I never have actually heard that before.

09:47.298 --> 09:48.507
23, you're bleeding.

09:48.966 --> 09:52.595
It's a knife wound from the last mission.
My blood gets pumping, it seeps.

09:52.761 --> 09:54.138
Hey, Maxine!

09:54.305 --> 09:57.016
Come over here
and we'll play a game I like to call:

09:57.182 --> 09:59.059
"Let's Go to the Dog Show."

09:59.226 --> 10:01.353
I put a collar on you
and make you my bi...!

10:06.233 --> 10:08.402
I think I really got inside his head.

10:08.569 --> 10:09.403
I am not proud of what I just did.

10:09.438 --> 10:10.237
I am not proud of what I just did.

10:10.404 --> 10:12.031
Game over, Chatty Cathy.

10:17.661 --> 10:20.039
Game over when I say it's over.

10:20.497 --> 10:21.999
- Okay.
- Wet willy.

10:23.834 --> 10:25.502
Okay. Who wants lunch?

10:25.669 --> 10:29.047
Well, excellent work, 23,
but I could've handled it my...

10:32.175 --> 10:35.595
- Max, the Chief wants to see you.
- It is nice to see you too!

10:43.019 --> 10:44.395
You wanted to see me, Chief?

10:44.562 --> 10:47.023
Yes, Max, yes, please, sit down.

10:47.190 --> 10:50.735
Your field-agent test results
just came in and...

10:52.153 --> 10:54.822
- Something wrong with your ear?
- Absolutely not.

10:54.989 --> 10:57.408
Would you like me
to wait while you answer that?

10:57.575 --> 10:58.701
Answer what?

10:58.868 --> 11:00.787
Nothing. You were saying?

11:00.954 --> 11:03.373
I was saying the results
are quite extraordinary.

11:03.540 --> 11:06.543
In fact, your essay on existentialism
was quite amazing.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.211
I left that section blank.

11:08.378 --> 11:10.213
Blank? Brilliant.

11:10.380 --> 11:11.881
Brilliant, Max.

11:12.048 --> 11:14.717
- You passed with flying colors.
- Yes!

11:14.884 --> 11:17.387
You know what, sir?
I can't say that I am shocked.

11:17.554 --> 11:20.265
I felt good about this year's test,
in light of the fact...

11:20.431 --> 11:23.142
...that in previous years,
my fitness has been an issue.

11:30.650 --> 11:31.693
Personal best.

11:31.860 --> 11:34.736
But not anymore. I'm ready for duty.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.072
I know how hard
you've prepared for this...

11:37.239 --> 11:39.032
...and how much this means to you...

11:39.199 --> 11:41.368
...but I'm afraid I can't promote you.

11:41.535 --> 11:45.080
- What?
- I can't afford to give up my best analyst.

11:45.247 --> 11:48.417
I mean, the amount of chatter
you get through, and the reports...

11:48.584 --> 11:50.752
...I mean, they go way beyond
the raw data.

11:51.420 --> 11:57.509
So to be clear, you're not promoting me,
because I do such a great job.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.763
Max, the way you and I work
is becoming a lost art form.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.766
I spend half my days
trying to convince the vice president...

12:04.933 --> 12:07.728
...that intelligence comes
from humans and not satellites.

12:07.895 --> 12:11.315
Men with hunches,
that's where the real work gets done.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.442
I'm very proud of you, Max...

12:13.942 --> 12:16.111
...very proud of you...

12:16.278 --> 12:18.155
...but I need you where you are.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.472
I am sorry, but we can never be,

12:44.639 --> 12:48.643
Despite today's setback, I will
at some point become a field agent...

12:48.809 --> 12:50.102
...and when that happens...

12:50.269 --> 12:53.522
...one phone call could take me
to the other side of the world.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.985
Who am I kidding? I'm a middle-aged
man who's missed the train.

12:58.653 --> 13:02.281
You don't deserve this.
I don't deserve you.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.909
You're so young and so full of life.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.119
Don't do it, Fang.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.288
Don't love me.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.084
Here.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.211
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.838
That was my last mile.
I have no idea how fast it was.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.341
You were moving.
It's not easy to knock me down.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.760
I have a low center of gravity.
Pretty solid.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.263
I'm just gonna call that one a 4:50.

13:25.429 --> 13:29.433
Impressive. I once ran a 5:16.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.478
Oh, really? That's, uh, slower.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.146
Not everything's a competition.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.148
Well, if it were, I'd win.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.526
Ah. Are you flirting with me?

13:39.569 --> 13:41.695
Not at all. Are you flirting with me?

13:41.862 --> 13:43.613
That depends. Is it working?

13:44.155 --> 13:45.991
Not at all.

13:46.157 --> 13:48.618
Well, nice meeting you!
I admire your focus!

13:52.205 --> 13:53.832
Am I invisible?

14:29.701 --> 14:32.495
Bruce, Lloyd, what happened?

14:32.662 --> 14:35.207
And what is that ungodly smell?

14:35.582 --> 14:36.875
Fear.

14:38.585 --> 14:39.920
I'll be back.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.134
Freeze.

14:47.301 --> 14:48.594
Freeze.

14:49.261 --> 14:50.763
- No, you freeze.
- You freeze.

14:50.930 --> 14:53.098
- I told you to freeze.
- Freeze times infinity.

14:53.265 --> 14:54.558
Oh, my God.

14:55.351 --> 14:56.769
- You.
- You.

14:56.936 --> 14:58.729
- Are you CONTROL?
- I'm Maxwell Smart.

14:58.896 --> 15:00.856
I am a CONTROL analyst. Who are you?

15:02.608 --> 15:04.193
I'm Agent 99.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.571
Oh, my word. You are Agent 99?

15:07.738 --> 15:10.449
- I am a huge fan!
- Thank you.

15:21.001 --> 15:22.753
What are you doing?

15:23.462 --> 15:24.964
I'm right here, just talk to me!

15:25.130 --> 15:27.550
I'm going to cause a diversion.
You run and get help.

15:27.716 --> 15:29.677
- I really don't think that that's a...
- Shh.

15:29.843 --> 15:31.804
- Did you just...?
- Shh!

15:49.989 --> 15:51.155
Go, go, go!

15:51.656 --> 15:52.699
Wait!

15:55.159 --> 15:56.494
Somebody shut it off!

16:04.502 --> 16:07.255
Good, 23, just in time.
I think I got one of them.

16:09.299 --> 16:10.884
Is that the Chief?

16:12.343 --> 16:13.970
Yes, it is.

16:14.137 --> 16:15.346
Sorry about that, Chief.

16:15.972 --> 16:17.974
Is that a dent in his head?

16:34.866 --> 16:36.534
Hi. Hi.

16:36.701 --> 16:39.537
Agent 13, you are in a tree.

16:39.704 --> 16:42.999
Yeah, communications got
knocked down, so they put me in a tree.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.168
- Old-school stuff.
- Glad to see you're okay.

16:45.335 --> 16:46.377
Yeah, yeah.

16:46.878 --> 16:50.215
Well, I have to get going.
Would you raise up the walkway, please?

16:50.381 --> 16:52.717
You don't have to get going.
You don't have to go.

16:52.884 --> 16:54.052
Yeah, I've got a meeting.

16:54.219 --> 16:55.844
- How you been?
- I've been well.

16:56.011 --> 16:58.722
- Everything good?
- It's great. Well, I gotta...

16:58.889 --> 17:00.515
Could you come back this way?

17:01.725 --> 17:03.393
Yeah, yeah, I think I will.

17:03.727 --> 17:05.061
What time?

17:05.521 --> 17:08.065
Well... Mm.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.192
I get it.

17:11.276 --> 17:13.278
Who wants to talk to a guy in a tree?

17:13.444 --> 17:14.738
I get it.

17:15.864 --> 17:18.659
Hang in there.
Don't cry, don't... Please don't cry.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.765
Okay. Let's get started.

17:41.932 --> 17:44.601
You'll have to bear with me,
I'm still a little fuzzy.

17:44.768 --> 17:47.271
I got a pretty good
hit in the head yesterday.

17:47.437 --> 17:51.441
Yes, it was dark in there.
You probably tripped.

17:51.608 --> 17:54.653
I hurt my knee. It was smoky too.

17:56.113 --> 17:58.156
All right, here's what we know.

17:58.323 --> 18:01.117
Wait. Chief, I request
the cone of silence.

18:01.284 --> 18:05.037
Max, not the cone of silence.
We're in a safe room, for God's sakes.

18:05.204 --> 18:06.789
We thought CONTROL was safe.

18:07.582 --> 18:08.916
Okay. Lloyd.

18:12.837 --> 18:16.674
Okay, we have reason to believe
that our security was breached by KAOS.

18:16.841 --> 18:19.135
- You have to speak up.
Can you hear me?

18:19.302 --> 18:21.137
- I'm not hearing anyone.
- What?

18:21.304 --> 18:23.222
Can you hear me?
What did you say?

18:23.389 --> 18:25.975
- Bruce, it's not working.
- It's not working!

18:27.226 --> 18:30.021
Chief! I hit you in the head
with a fire extinguisher!

18:30.188 --> 18:32.148
No, no, no, we're not ready yet.

18:32.315 --> 18:34.275
Okay. All right.

18:34.442 --> 18:36.694
- It doesn't work, get rid of it.
- Turn it off.

18:36.861 --> 18:39.488
This thing is no good.
It's a useless piece of garbage.

18:39.655 --> 18:41.824
- Turn it off!
- Larabee, you all right?

18:41.991 --> 18:43.910
Larabee wants out!

18:48.664 --> 18:51.459
Today's the day, and we're gonna
get rid of this damn thing.

18:51.626 --> 18:54.212
That is cold. That's cold.
All right, easy.

18:54.378 --> 18:56.005
All right, are we done?

18:56.172 --> 18:57.548
Yep. I can hear now.

18:57.715 --> 19:00.843
Sorry, Chief, someone led me to believe
the cone was ready.

19:01.010 --> 19:03.679
For the record, I never actually
used the word "ready."

19:03.846 --> 19:07.516
"I'll show them the cone. The cone's
the shizzle. " You said that to me.

19:08.308 --> 19:09.601
All right, shut up. Listen up, people.

19:09.768 --> 19:12.229
There's been a rash of thefts
of nuclear material...

19:12.395 --> 19:14.856
...especially yellowcake,
over the last three months.

19:15.023 --> 19:19.653
Now, based on Max's intel, we were
able to get Agent 38 inside KAOS.

19:19.819 --> 19:22.030
We must've been close
to uncovering something...

19:22.197 --> 19:24.032
...so KAOS hit us and they hit us hard.

19:24.199 --> 19:25.992
They hacked our system...

19:26.159 --> 19:27.514
...and learned the identities
of all our field agents.

19:27.549 --> 19:28.870
...and learned the identities
of all our field agents.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.081
Around the world
our people are under attack.

19:38.463 --> 19:42.175
Our only lead is the maker of the bomb
KAOS used against us.

19:42.342 --> 19:43.885
Vladimir Krs...

19:44.052 --> 19:45.971
- It's pronounced "Krstic," sir.
- Yes...

19:47.347 --> 19:48.723
Krstic.

19:50.225 --> 19:54.563
Yes. He is a Bosnian national, and one
of KAOS' favorite munitions suppliers.

19:54.729 --> 19:57.524
Unfortunately, we have no idea
where he is.

19:57.691 --> 19:59.818
Actually, sir, we do. He is in Russia.

19:59.985 --> 20:03.029
- How do you know that?
- It was on page 482 of my report.

20:05.365 --> 20:06.992
Doesn't anybody read my reports?

20:08.243 --> 20:11.704
All right, our mission is clear, people.
Find Krs...

20:11.871 --> 20:13.455
- Krstic.
- Yes. Find him!

20:13.622 --> 20:15.624
- Kris Kringle. Fish stick.
Yes, Krs...

20:15.791 --> 20:17.418
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
Krstic.

20:17.585 --> 20:21.171
Use him to get to KAOS, then recover
the stolen nuclear material...

20:21.338 --> 20:23.757
...before they can do something
less than friendly...

20:23.924 --> 20:27.928
...and maybe, if we're lucky, we can
apprehend the man behind it all...

20:28.095 --> 20:29.180
...Siegfried.

20:29.346 --> 20:32.266
Pictured here with his
number two man, Shtarker.

20:32.433 --> 20:35.269
How are we gonna do that
when our agents are compromised?

20:35.436 --> 20:38.272
Put me out there, Chief.
I'm not afraid to expose myself.

20:38.439 --> 20:40.524
Do you ever think before you speak?

20:40.691 --> 20:43.110
No, I just whip it out there.
It's what's best.

20:43.277 --> 20:44.945
Fortunately, we have other options.

20:45.112 --> 20:49.867
99 recently underwent massive plastic
surgery, so her new face is not known yet.

20:50.034 --> 20:52.953
We also have a new agent, Agent 86.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.413
Who's that, sir?

20:54.580 --> 20:56.207
It's you, Max.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.627
All right, Maxie.

21:00.920 --> 21:01.962
You did it.

21:03.881 --> 21:05.633
Lloyd, may I have the C.O.S. Please?

21:10.471 --> 21:11.639
I'm so happy!

21:11.805 --> 21:15.934
I'm so happy!
This is the best day of my life!

21:18.144 --> 21:21.606
Max, you didn't push
the button hard enough.

21:21.773 --> 21:24.275
- So you could hear me?
Yes.

21:25.068 --> 21:26.778
- Right.
Excuse me, Chief.

21:26.945 --> 21:29.405
Just a thought,
I'm not questioning your judgment...

21:29.572 --> 21:31.533
99, I insist on complete honesty.

21:31.699 --> 21:34.744
If you have something to say to me,
I wish you would just say it.

21:34.911 --> 21:37.247
Max has no experience.
I don't want him as my partner.

21:37.413 --> 21:40.833
Well, that is a sucker punch
to the gonads.

21:43.336 --> 21:47.257
Hey, Max. We got you a lovely
parting gift for your first mission.

21:47.423 --> 21:49.676
Oh, a pocketknife.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.178
Not just a pocketknife,
Swiss Army knife.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.848
Comes with tweezers, pliers,
a tiny magnifying glass.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.184
Fish scaler, a saw, a flamethrower,
chisel, a wire-crimping tool.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.228
- What was that thing you said?
- Chisel?

22:00.395 --> 22:02.188
Before that.
Did you say flamethrower?

22:02.355 --> 22:03.690
- Yeah.
- Check it.

22:06.317 --> 22:08.486
We also added a crossbow
that fires harpoons...

22:08.653 --> 22:12.365
...connected to spider-silk nano-thread.
Has the strength of steel cable.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.034
It's a time-consuming,
labor-intensive technology.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.369
The spiders
have to be individually milked.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.496
And they do not like it.

22:19.663 --> 22:20.998
No, they don't.

22:21.164 --> 22:23.125
Gentlemen, you're the best.

22:23.625 --> 22:24.668
Thanks.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.104
Ladies and gentlemen,
while you are in your seats...

22:44.271 --> 22:46.481
...please keep your seatbelts fastened.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.985
I feel really good about us as partners.

22:50.152 --> 22:51.862
23 says that's important.

22:52.571 --> 22:55.240
"Trust is a must." That's what 23 says.

22:55.407 --> 22:56.408
Does he?

22:56.575 --> 22:59.578
You and I share a bond, I think.

22:59.745 --> 23:03.916
We both know what it feels like to look
in the mirror and not like what we see.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.919
You with the surgery,
me with the weight loss.

23:07.169 --> 23:09.171
I wanna show you something.

23:13.342 --> 23:14.426
That was me.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.512
Wow, impressive.

23:16.678 --> 23:18.347
Congratulations.

23:18.514 --> 23:20.015
Thank you.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.561
This is me.

23:28.272 --> 23:30.191
Very impressive, 99.

23:30.900 --> 23:33.444
You were truly hideous back then.

23:36.030 --> 23:38.574
Since we are going
to be portraying husband and wife...

23:38.741 --> 23:41.118
...maybe we should get our story set.

23:41.452 --> 23:42.954
Okay, good idea.

23:44.789 --> 23:49.293
We met at a marketing convention
in Vegas. Married a year later. No kids.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.379
I like your parents, but you hate mine.

23:51.546 --> 23:52.922
Do we want kids?

23:53.089 --> 23:55.967
Well, you do,
but I'm concentrating on my career.

23:56.133 --> 23:58.886
I don't know if that's fair.
I mean, I'm older than you are.

23:59.053 --> 24:02.098
- Well, not by much.
- Really?

24:03.641 --> 24:06.978
When they gave me a new face,
I had them...

24:07.812 --> 24:09.939
...take a couple years off.

24:10.106 --> 24:11.607
You know, why not?

24:12.441 --> 24:17.154
Well, if that's the case, then you are
at an advanced age, and you should be...

24:17.321 --> 24:19.115
Well, no. I was never...

24:19.282 --> 24:23.494
I'm just saying that your eggs could
dry up and fall out of your uterus.

24:23.661 --> 24:25.997
So time is of the essence.

24:27.122 --> 24:30.083
- That's your opinion.
- No, that is a medical fact.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.961
There is a lot of time
for me to make this decision.

24:33.128 --> 24:35.505
I will not be rushed into it
by you or my mother.

24:35.672 --> 24:38.133
- You don't have much time.
- Where is the drink cart?

24:42.846 --> 24:43.847
Uh-oh.

24:44.014 --> 24:45.765
- What?
- Six o'clock.

24:46.641 --> 24:50.228
Don't turn around, don't turn around.
Use your peripherals.

24:54.691 --> 24:56.026
Do you see him?

24:56.276 --> 24:59.529
I'm just widening my eyes.
I'm not actually seeing anything more.

24:59.696 --> 25:02.157
The big guy that might as well
be holding up a sign:

25:02.324 --> 25:04.117
"I'm an assassin, here to kill you."

25:04.284 --> 25:06.703
Okay, 99, you know what?
That is profiling.

25:06.870 --> 25:11.499
Just because he is large doesn't
necessarily mean that he is a bad guy.

25:16.129 --> 25:19.216
That's a bad guy.
That's a really bad guy.

25:19.382 --> 25:21.176
- You don't say.
- Did you see his face?

25:21.343 --> 25:22.385
Yes.

25:22.552 --> 25:25.889
His head looks like
one of the Easter Island heads.

25:28.141 --> 25:30.143
You know what?
I'm doing the same thing.

25:30.310 --> 25:33.187
That's profiling,
and I will have none of it.

25:33.354 --> 25:37.191
Darn it, I have gum on my new shoes.

25:42.196 --> 25:44.532
- He's trying to light his shoe.
It's a shoe bomb!

25:44.698 --> 25:45.950
- Get him!
- It's gum.

25:46.116 --> 25:49.620
- He's got a gun!
- Not... Gum! Not... No! Gum!

25:52.831 --> 25:54.416
Gum!

25:54.583 --> 25:56.585
Federal marshal, you're under arrest.

25:56.752 --> 26:00.130
Sir, I believe you just shattered
my coccyx.

26:01.465 --> 26:04.218
Folks, we may
be experiencing a little turbulence,

26:04.385 --> 26:06.929
The "fasten seatbelt" sign
has been turned on,

26:08.764 --> 26:11.559
Well, you were no help whatsoever.

26:11.725 --> 26:15.437
How could I help? I'm just a woman
with a dusty old uterus.

26:15.604 --> 26:17.898
I never said dusty.

26:18.524 --> 26:20.609
We're close to the drop site.
I'll go first.

26:20.776 --> 26:23.779
- Gonna be all right with your cuffs?
- No cuffs can contain me.

26:25.614 --> 26:27.616
Excuse me, violent sky marshal.

26:28.534 --> 26:29.785
What do you want?

26:29.952 --> 26:31.412
I have to squeeze the lemon.

26:31.579 --> 26:33.080
Ugh.

26:33.539 --> 26:34.957
You heard me.

26:35.123 --> 26:37.292
Squeeze the lemon.

26:50.430 --> 26:53.808
- Do you work out?
- Occasionally.

26:53.975 --> 26:56.144
Yeah, I'm big on protein. Protein's great.

27:09.282 --> 27:12.160
I gotta get it out. I gotta get that out!

27:14.120 --> 27:16.998
That's in there, that's in there.

27:25.798 --> 27:27.467
No time for pain.

27:27.634 --> 27:29.344
Over the drop zone.

27:35.517 --> 27:37.352
Ball sack!

27:46.860 --> 27:48.487
Son of a hamster.

27:48.654 --> 27:50.864
You all right in there?
- Yeah. Yes, I am.

27:51.156 --> 27:52.324
Everything's fine.

27:52.491 --> 27:54.535
Mother of pearl!

28:01.875 --> 28:03.460
That burns!

28:03.627 --> 28:04.962
Last chance.

28:08.549 --> 28:12.219
Airlock activated, Three, two, one,

28:16.807 --> 28:18.642
First package away.

28:26.233 --> 28:28.151
Absolutely, I love cats.

28:28.318 --> 28:29.361
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:35.534 --> 28:36.994
Damn.

28:50.590 --> 28:52.425
Second package away.

29:10.943 --> 29:12.862
Oh, good, you heard me.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.617
Third package away.

29:18.701 --> 29:19.744
Third package?

29:25.958 --> 29:28.127
99, Easter Island.

29:35.301 --> 29:40.139
- I'll be right back!
- Where could you possibly be going?

30:05.163 --> 30:08.375
Okay, never do that again!

30:08.542 --> 30:10.585
Stop hanging on me!
Never! Stop it!

30:16.925 --> 30:20.595
Max, I can't reach
my reserve! Do something!

30:28.270 --> 30:30.647
That would have definitely
worked on me.

30:30.814 --> 30:35.193
Are you crazy?
If I can't pull my chute, you'll die too!

30:55.379 --> 30:57.047
Aim for the haystack.
Stop talking.

30:57.214 --> 30:59.967
- Aim for the haystack, it's softer.
- Stop talking!

31:01.719 --> 31:03.137
You missed it.

31:31.415 --> 31:34.043
Okay, not to keep dwelling on this...

31:34.210 --> 31:36.545
...but that was some kiss.

31:36.712 --> 31:38.255
How did you know that would work?

31:38.422 --> 31:41.091
Have you kissed other men
who plummeted to their deaths?

31:41.258 --> 31:42.259
Okay, you know what?

31:42.426 --> 31:44.303
So far, our entire partnership...

31:44.470 --> 31:46.847
...has consisted of me
getting you out of trouble.

31:47.014 --> 31:49.266
Do you know why?
It is because you keep leading.

31:49.767 --> 31:51.936
So here's how we stop that. I lead now.

31:52.102 --> 31:54.230
I'm the one with experience.
You know nothing.

31:54.563 --> 31:56.106
I beg to differ.

31:56.273 --> 31:58.942
I looked up your field agent exam,
and I scored...

31:59.108 --> 32:01.110
- My what?
- Your field agent exam.

32:01.277 --> 32:03.071
I scored eight points higher than you.

32:03.238 --> 32:04.322
This is not a classroom.

32:04.489 --> 32:07.033
That's the difference between
an A plus and an A minus.

32:07.200 --> 32:10.954
- You'll get us killed if you don't listen!
- A minus!

32:11.704 --> 32:14.541
Okay, you're faced with an assassin.
What do you do?

32:14.707 --> 32:18.127
- I take out my gun, and I would shoot...
- You don't have a gun.

32:18.294 --> 32:20.088
- I did until you took it.
- Bang. You're dead.

32:20.255 --> 32:21.464
- No, I'm not.
- Bang. You're dead.

32:21.631 --> 32:22.924
- Stop shooting me.
- You are dead.

32:23.091 --> 32:25.051
- I don't like it when you shoot me.
- Bang. Bang. Bang.

32:25.218 --> 32:26.386
- Stop it.
- Bang. Bang.

32:26.553 --> 32:29.722
Stop shooting me more.
You already said I was... Hey.

32:30.223 --> 32:31.766
Throw out your manual.

32:31.933 --> 32:35.311
Out here there are no grades,
there's only dead, and not dead.

32:36.437 --> 32:40.483
You know, I am not completely
incompetent without a gun.

32:40.650 --> 32:43.653
I am a master
in the art of Hwa Rang Do.

32:46.990 --> 32:49.158
- I was not ready.
- That's my point.

32:49.325 --> 32:50.618
Yeah, you know what? That...

32:50.785 --> 32:52.954
Hey, what was that?

32:58.001 --> 33:01.754
Max is halfway to Moscow. Don't tell me
you're still translating that Russian.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.505
They talk fast, it's hard.

33:04.631 --> 33:07.176
It takes like eight
of these morons to do what Max did.

33:07.342 --> 33:09.511
I can't wait till we finish
the Hymie project.

33:09.678 --> 33:11.722
All these stupid agents will be obsolete.

33:11.889 --> 33:13.390
- Bye-bye.
- What's a Hymie?

33:13.557 --> 33:16.685
Hybrid Mechanical Intelligence Entity.
Basically a robot.

33:16.852 --> 33:18.770
It's a stolen KAOS technology.

33:18.937 --> 33:21.356
Being reprogrammed. Top-secret.
Need-to-know.

33:21.523 --> 33:23.192
And you don't need.

33:23.609 --> 33:26.862
I'm a trained killer.
I can kill you with anything in this office.

33:27.029 --> 33:30.032
You wanna die by Post-its?
Because I could make that happen.

33:30.199 --> 33:31.867
And that's a slow death.

33:33.368 --> 33:34.703
Larabee.
- Yeah.

33:34.870 --> 33:36.622
- Were you the last one to use the copier?
- Yeah.

33:36.788 --> 33:37.956
You left it jammed.

33:38.123 --> 33:40.459
So? Why don't you...

33:40.834 --> 33:42.127
...unjam it?

33:42.294 --> 33:45.297
- Just open the door, read the instructions.
- This your stapler?

33:45.464 --> 33:48.050
- Want me to show you how to use it?
- No.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.802
Unjam that.

33:50.969 --> 33:52.221
- 23.
- Yes.

33:52.387 --> 33:54.890
- Can I have a moment, please?
- Sure.

33:55.557 --> 33:56.725
Yes, Chief.

33:56.892 --> 34:00.062
Let me tell you about a pattern
that's beginning to emerge.

34:00.229 --> 34:02.439
As a former field agent,
I'm very much aware...

34:02.606 --> 34:05.734
...of how difficult it is
to make the transition to office life.

34:05.901 --> 34:07.401
He didn't unjam the copier.

34:07.568 --> 34:10.446
We have rules here. If you don't
follow the rules, then what are we?

34:10.612 --> 34:12.031
I'll tell you what we're not.

34:12.197 --> 34:15.201
We're not people
who jam staples into people's heads.

34:15.368 --> 34:16.994
That's CIA crap.

34:17.161 --> 34:19.371
All right, look, Chief, I'm your best guy.

34:19.539 --> 34:23.042
I don't belong in an office making copies.
I should be out there with Max.

34:23.208 --> 34:25.628
Look, 23, no more stapling today.

34:27.088 --> 34:28.339
Just hold on.

34:34.719 --> 34:36.764
So how do you know this place?

34:36.931 --> 34:39.266
Well, as an analyst,
I like to keep my ears open.

34:39.433 --> 34:40.810
It's amazing what you learn...

34:40.976 --> 34:44.772
...listening to chatter.
In fact, Ladislas Krstic loves this place.

34:44.938 --> 34:49.902
As do many KAOS agents.
CafÃ© Minsk-Pinsk in Smolensk.

34:50.069 --> 34:52.280
It doesn't get any better than "thinsk."

34:53.614 --> 34:55.616
You see what I just did?

34:55.783 --> 34:58.411
I added an "insk" at the end,
made it sound Russian.

34:58.578 --> 35:00.121
Should've smacked you harder.

35:00.288 --> 35:01.622
Is that your default setting?

35:01.789 --> 35:04.292
Do you just punch people
in the face willy-nilly?

35:04.458 --> 35:06.419
"It's Tuesday,
I'll punch Max in the face."

35:06.586 --> 35:09.297
"A box of kittens,
time to punch Max in the face."

35:09.463 --> 35:11.798
"I'm having bread,
time to punch Max in the face."

35:11.965 --> 35:13.466
You know, I love bread...

35:13.633 --> 35:15.969
...and I know bread
has a few carbs, but...

35:16.136 --> 35:18.221
...I've never really been afraid of carbs...

35:18.388 --> 35:22.809
...because it seems like no matter
how many I eat, I stay "thinsk."

35:38.074 --> 35:40.285
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

35:40.452 --> 35:42.162
No sprechen Sie Russian.

36:26.247 --> 36:29.208
Boy, you know what? I will tell you,
I love your country.

36:29.375 --> 36:32.711
No more Communism.
No rules of any kind, really.

36:32.878 --> 36:36.549
I'm filling my suitcase with steroids
and art from ancient Mesopotamia.

36:36.715 --> 36:40.344
Ran over an old woman yesterday.
Best vacation I've ever had.

36:44.056 --> 36:46.058
Time to take my pill.

36:52.523 --> 36:54.859
There was a guy in the bathroom
who's really hot.

36:56.485 --> 36:58.028
Okay...

36:58.195 --> 37:00.322
No, no, no. Radioactive hot.

37:00.489 --> 37:03.742
Although he did have a certain
rugged quality that some find appealing.

37:03.909 --> 37:05.911
How did you know he was radioactive?

37:06.245 --> 37:09.748
My watch is a Geiger counter.
You don't have one of these?

37:10.207 --> 37:13.169
Listen, I think he was part
of the nuclear theft in Chechnya.

37:13.335 --> 37:14.545
We should follow him.

37:14.712 --> 37:16.338
I gotta say, Max...

37:17.089 --> 37:18.549
...you picked a good restaurant.

37:56.544 --> 37:57.629
Of course.

37:58.463 --> 37:59.881
Tripe soup.

38:00.048 --> 38:03.134
- This must be Ladislas Krstic's house.
- What?

38:03.301 --> 38:06.888
Tripe soup is his favorite dish.
It was in the mission dossier.

38:07.055 --> 38:09.140
Let's just see what we're
up against, okay?

38:17.732 --> 38:19.734
I didn't get to eat at the restaurant.

38:19.901 --> 38:23.112
And if you skip a meal,
the next meal you overindulge.

38:23.279 --> 38:25.322
- Well, let me. I've got nails.
- It's a recipe for...

38:27.282 --> 38:28.617
You owe me $3.

38:30.494 --> 38:33.664
More guards.
We'll have to figure out a way in.

38:39.545 --> 38:40.587
Miniature blowgun.

38:40.754 --> 38:42.965
You don't have one of these?

38:43.131 --> 38:47.177
These darts are tipped with a tranquilizer
derived from the skin of a lizard...

38:47.344 --> 38:49.513
...known as los zapatos de la muerte,

38:49.680 --> 38:50.764
"The shoes of death."

38:51.682 --> 38:52.975
Excuse me.

38:53.517 --> 38:56.687
They're 40 yards out,
that's definitely the edge of my range.

38:56.854 --> 39:00.524
I'm going to have to give this one
a little something extra.

39:17.958 --> 39:19.543
You look spectacular.

39:19.710 --> 39:20.836
Thanks.

39:21.128 --> 39:22.963
You don't look too bad yourself.

39:24.214 --> 39:25.507
Is that a wig?

39:25.674 --> 39:27.217
Yeah, it came with the dress.

39:27.885 --> 39:31.888
- How did I get into these clothes?
- That's not important. Let's go.

39:35.183 --> 39:36.475
Am I wearing boxers?

39:39.520 --> 39:42.732
For future reference,
I usually prefer briefs...

39:42.899 --> 39:45.359
...for their security and peace of mind.

39:45.526 --> 39:47.862
Going free-bird is not exactly ideal.

39:48.196 --> 39:49.864
I don't like it.

40:05.755 --> 40:07.673
There must be 200 people here.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.927
Finding Krstic will be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.103
I'd love to dance.

40:21.270 --> 40:25.274
English? But you understand Russian?
Very impressive.

40:25.942 --> 40:27.527
Shall we?

40:28.361 --> 40:30.071
I hope your date doesn't mind.

40:30.238 --> 40:32.114
Oh, he's not my date.

40:32.281 --> 40:35.450
He's just a local horse groomer
I hired to drive me around.

40:35.617 --> 40:39.621
It's a tragic story. He's quite deaf.
Really not bright.

40:40.580 --> 40:44.125
I am going to dance now.

40:44.459 --> 40:48.380
You go get yourself some punch.

40:49.631 --> 40:51.049
Okay.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.761
I don't even know
how much gets through.

41:03.645 --> 41:05.146
Chief, I need your help.

41:05.313 --> 41:06.648
You're on. Go ahead.

41:06.815 --> 41:07.941
We have found Krstic,

41:08.108 --> 41:10.652
I searched his house,
I can 't find his computer network,

41:10.819 --> 41:11.653
Get me an infrared satellite scan.

41:11.688 --> 41:12.487
Get me an infrared satellite scan.

41:12.654 --> 41:15.740
I have to get back to 99,
she is in grave danger.

41:18.994 --> 41:20.912
Your house is so beautiful.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.665
It must be difficult to go to work.

41:24.666 --> 41:27.085
I don't have to go very far.

42:02.745 --> 42:04.497
I don't think so.

42:04.830 --> 42:06.373
I wasn't talking to you.

42:10.669 --> 42:11.712
Me?

42:13.464 --> 42:14.632
I don't know.

42:14.798 --> 42:16.383
It'll be fun.

42:16.759 --> 42:17.801
Trust me.

43:09.602 --> 43:11.437
You are so light on your feet.

43:11.604 --> 43:13.022
I recently lost 150 pounds.

43:13.356 --> 43:15.150
So did I.

43:15.316 --> 43:17.569
Isn't it great?
I have so much more energy now.

43:17.735 --> 43:19.195
Me too.

44:25.928 --> 44:28.138
- Thanks for jumping.
- No problem.

44:51.994 --> 44:54.038
Thank you for the lovely dance.

45:15.768 --> 45:17.645
Did you see anything
while I was dancing?

45:17.812 --> 45:21.190
Just once, but I don't think you expected
him to lift you so high.

45:22.567 --> 45:25.570
Anyway, I found out that the office
is in the guest house.

45:25.736 --> 45:27.363
Really? How'd you do that?

45:27.530 --> 45:30.199
Show him a little dÃ©colletage,
cleavage, bat your eyes?

45:30.366 --> 45:32.368
I'm not judging, just detecting a pattern.

45:32.535 --> 45:34.912
- Ready to work?
- I'm ready to work. You ready?

45:35.079 --> 45:36.998
- Oh, my God.
- You're just having fun showing your:

45:45.506 --> 45:47.758
Six guards.
We are going to need another way in.

45:47.925 --> 45:50.094
Stand by, Max. Larabee, let's go. Move it.

45:50.553 --> 45:52.680
- What'd you do?
- I can't find the right screen.

45:52.847 --> 45:55.057
It was here a second ago,
then it went away.

45:55.224 --> 45:57.893
- What did you hit?
- Don't yell at me. It's not helping!

45:58.059 --> 45:59.519
If you don't find that screen...

45:59.686 --> 46:02.606
...I'm gonna have you hunting
for land mines, with a hammer!

46:05.609 --> 46:07.611
Got it, Max, There is one other entrance,

46:07.777 --> 46:08.862
What kind of entrance?

46:09.029 --> 46:11.948
The kind where you'll wanna
throw your shoes out afterwards.

46:12.616 --> 46:16.620
Oh, great, rats.
It's not enough that there's poop.

46:16.786 --> 46:21.708
You know what, I never saw James Bond
in rats or poop, let alone rats and poop.

46:22.584 --> 46:25.462
Look, a rat riding on a piece of poop.

46:25.629 --> 46:28.381
Stop it. It's just a storm drain.

46:32.636 --> 46:34.095
Here it is.

46:45.482 --> 46:49.110
Exploding dental floss.
You don't have this? Hm.

46:58.662 --> 47:00.579
Three, two...

47:01.247 --> 47:02.289
...one.

47:25.187 --> 47:26.814
Right.

47:32.653 --> 47:33.821
Come on.

47:50.963 --> 47:52.339
Are you staring at my butt?

47:53.215 --> 47:55.009
No, I am not.

47:55.176 --> 47:57.511
I might have been before, but I am...

47:57.678 --> 48:00.389
Now I am again. All right, I'm stopping.

48:00.556 --> 48:03.642
Pay attention to what I'm doing,
so that you can follow me exactly.

48:04.059 --> 48:05.310
Yep.

48:25.747 --> 48:27.999
Okay, Max. Little heads-up.

48:28.166 --> 48:31.252
High-intensity lasers. Whatever
part of you does touch gets sliced.

48:31.419 --> 48:34.589
One more reason
why boxers were a bad idea.

48:46.851 --> 48:49.270
All right, so do I have to do it
exactly like that?

48:49.437 --> 48:50.605
Just come on.

49:04.327 --> 49:06.746
That's impressive.

49:09.039 --> 49:10.749
Careful, this one's tricky.

49:10.916 --> 49:12.376
Good.

49:12.543 --> 49:13.585
Very good.

49:15.796 --> 49:16.964
Okay, it's not that good.

49:36.650 --> 49:37.818
Max. Max.

49:38.068 --> 49:39.319
Stay calm.

49:41.238 --> 49:43.949
Max, keep it together. Keep it together.

49:44.992 --> 49:46.493
Max. Max.

49:48.078 --> 49:49.663
Careful! No, no.

49:49.830 --> 49:51.748
He's nibbling. That's not cheese!

49:53.542 --> 49:54.793
Max, be quiet!

50:03.093 --> 50:05.095
Okay, shall we?

50:43.549 --> 50:45.051
Did I hear something?

50:45.218 --> 50:48.471
Yes, there were some
tap dancers in the hallway.

50:50.807 --> 50:53.893
Damn it. I can't get into their system.
Biometric security.

50:54.060 --> 50:55.853
If you don't mind, 99...

51:01.067 --> 51:05.154
The old "steam sticks to everything
but the oil from the last thumb print" trick.

51:05.321 --> 51:06.364
Here we go.

51:06.572 --> 51:09.826
- Shipments of explosives.
- Your boyfriend is a very bad man.

51:09.992 --> 51:13.162
- And a really good kisser.
- Ignoring that.

51:16.249 --> 51:19.000
Look at that shipment of detonators.
It's a little odd.

51:19.167 --> 51:21.086
Well, he is a bomb-maker.

51:21.253 --> 51:24.422
No. What is odd is that it was shipped
to a bakery in Moscow.

51:24.589 --> 51:27.175
These detonators can also be used
for nuclear bombs.

51:27.342 --> 51:29.177
I think this is our connection to KAOS.

51:42.274 --> 51:43.775
I set that up.

51:54.619 --> 51:55.871
Let her go.

51:56.288 --> 51:57.706
No.

52:01.710 --> 52:05.213
I'm not totally incompetent
without a gun, you know.

52:29.945 --> 52:31.071
Thanks for the help.

52:32.114 --> 52:34.658
That's enough. Pity.

52:35.284 --> 52:39.497
I'm about to shoot beautiful woman
and her retard stable boy.

52:39.663 --> 52:40.706
And yet...

52:41.582 --> 52:43.792
...I will sleep like baby.

52:49.757 --> 52:52.301
- Not bad for a rookie.
- Not bad for an old lady.

53:02.812 --> 53:03.854
Siegfried here.

53:04.313 --> 53:06.440
How could you possibly screw this up?

53:06.607 --> 53:08.108
Krstic was a fool.

53:08.275 --> 53:09.109
- And they got lucky.
- Who 's that? Who 's speaking?

53:09.144 --> 53:10.086
- And they got lucky.
- Who 's that? Who 's speaking?

53:10.121 --> 53:11.028
- And they got lucky.
- Who 's that? Who 's speaking?

53:11.195 --> 53:12.321
That's no one, sir.

53:12.488 --> 53:15.282
They're heading towards you,
Don 't disappoint me again,

53:15.449 --> 53:16.951
Don't worry, sir. They won't get pa...

53:18.702 --> 53:19.787
Why does he do that?

53:19.954 --> 53:21.831
Don't look at me. I'm no one.

53:21.997 --> 53:23.499
And don't you forget it.

53:23.791 --> 53:26.043
Everyone here can be replaced.

53:26.210 --> 53:27.877
I even have backup for you.

53:28.044 --> 53:30.046
It's called a rhinoceros.

53:55.864 --> 53:58.658
I think it's time to find new wheels.
Pull over.

54:04.706 --> 54:07.083
I feel good about the mission so far,
don't you?

54:07.250 --> 54:08.501
So far, sure.

54:08.668 --> 54:10.587
I think we work very well together.

54:10.753 --> 54:12.088
Like at the mansion.

54:12.255 --> 54:16.384
The way I held that guy's hair
while you punched him in the throat.

54:16.551 --> 54:18.428
That was nice.

54:19.095 --> 54:20.096
Nice?

54:20.263 --> 54:21.931
Yeah, well, good teamwork.

54:22.098 --> 54:23.600
What are you doing?

54:23.766 --> 54:26.269
I'm just saying that I think
we're very compatible.

54:26.436 --> 54:29.898
I think that you are confusing adrenaline
with, I don't know...

54:30.064 --> 54:31.607
...some other kind of hormone.

54:31.773 --> 54:34.193
- No. That's not...
- Know what, Max? Just stop it.

54:35.360 --> 54:38.113
Let me give you a lesson
that I had to learn the hard way.

54:38.280 --> 54:40.449
You can't trust anyone out here,
not even me.

54:40.616 --> 54:43.285
I mean, you know,
I could be a double agent.

54:43.869 --> 54:46.205
The break-in at CONTROL
was probably an inside job.

54:46.371 --> 54:49.458
It happened just as I got back.
How do you know that it wasn't me?

54:50.417 --> 54:52.961
- What are we talking about here?
- Let's just find a car.

54:53.128 --> 54:55.797
Which one's gonna attract
the least attention?

54:56.298 --> 54:59.927
All right, well, we have
a couple Soviet-era sedans here...

55:00.093 --> 55:03.472
...we have that tractor, that cart...

55:04.306 --> 55:06.475
...and... That'll work.

55:07.476 --> 55:10.354
- No.
- Yes.

55:10.521 --> 55:11.939
No.

55:12.272 --> 55:13.482
Yes.

55:17.110 --> 55:20.113
- Oh, yeah, we are really under the radar.
- Will you relax?

55:20.280 --> 55:23.158
Since the fall of Communism,
everybody has one of these here.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.353
There's our little KAOS bakery.

55:52.520 --> 55:55.648
I don't have to remind you,
but this isn't like the last place.

55:55.815 --> 55:59.360
There's no party, there's no dancing.
Everyone in there is a trained killer.

55:59.527 --> 56:01.362
Do you understand? Okay.

56:01.529 --> 56:04.031
Did they explain to you
how your belt buckle works?

56:04.198 --> 56:07.201
No, but the technology for holding
up pants hasn't changed much.

56:07.368 --> 56:09.370
- Max.
- Hey, what?

56:09.829 --> 56:12.623
This one has a compartment.
Inside there's a pill.

56:12.790 --> 56:15.877
If captured, it would cause death
in nine seconds.

56:16.043 --> 56:17.044
Great.

56:17.587 --> 56:20.548
But how exactly do I get them to take it?

56:22.717 --> 56:26.596
- Not much of a laugher, are you?
- Here. Put this on.

56:26.762 --> 56:28.181
- On what?
- On your molar.

56:28.347 --> 56:31.476
It's a tooth radio. It sends sound
up your jawbone, into your ear.

56:31.642 --> 56:33.519
I can't hear anything
outside your mouth...

56:33.686 --> 56:35.813
...so if you get in trouble,
you have to say so.

56:35.980 --> 56:37.023
Is it working?

56:40.442 --> 56:42.319
- Is it working?
- Yes.

56:42.486 --> 56:43.737
Good.

56:43.904 --> 56:44.905
Okay.

56:45.071 --> 56:47.782
Well, you know what to do.
Good luck in there.

56:47.949 --> 56:49.618
You too.

57:17.771 --> 57:19.606
Free rugelach?

57:19.773 --> 57:22.567
No, thank you.
I am here for something else.

57:22.901 --> 57:24.194
Bread?

57:24.361 --> 57:28.281
- Something hot.
- We have rolls that just came out.

57:28.448 --> 57:31.117
Even hotter. Much, much hotter.

57:31.451 --> 57:33.620
I already have boyfriend.

57:34.412 --> 57:36.998
- All right...
- Although, I could make exception.

57:37.165 --> 57:38.208
No, that's okay.

57:38.375 --> 57:41.586
Sure? Flour sacks in back,
very comfortable.

57:41.753 --> 57:45.256
I don't think we are on the same page.

57:45.589 --> 57:49.552
I'm here because Ladislas Krstic sent me.

57:49.718 --> 57:52.388
Ah. Take number.

57:53.681 --> 57:55.766
But I'm the only one here.

58:00.479 --> 58:02.106
Oh.

58:31.677 --> 58:33.012
Who are you?

58:33.179 --> 58:35.848
My name is Nudnik Shpilkes.
Who are you?

58:36.015 --> 58:38.642
- I am Siegfried.
- Did you say Siegfried?

58:39.977 --> 58:40.978
Max!

58:41.187 --> 58:42.229
Yes.

58:42.396 --> 58:44.315
I understand that you're
the man to see...

58:44.482 --> 58:47.526
...if someone is interested in acquiring
items of a nuclear nature.

58:47.693 --> 58:49.194
How do I know you're not CONTROL?

58:49.360 --> 58:51.279
If I were CONTROL,
you'd already be dead.

58:51.446 --> 58:53.364
If you were CONTROL,
you'd already be dead.

58:53.531 --> 58:57.535
Well, neither of us is dead,
so I'm obviously not from CONTROL.

59:01.247 --> 59:03.249
That actually makes sense.

59:04.584 --> 59:07.670
Follow me, Mr. Shpilkes.

59:13.885 --> 59:15.929
Test. Test.

59:19.098 --> 59:21.935
Ah. The "Ode to Joy"
from Beethoven's Ninth.

59:22.101 --> 59:26.105
Stone deaf when he wrote it.
Syphilis. Fun stuff.

59:26.731 --> 59:31.277
Yes, a personal favorite.
A bit familiar, but it ends with a bang.

59:32.612 --> 59:34.113
You're doing great, Max.

59:34.280 --> 59:38.326
What I'm about to show you is
the inner sanctum of our entire operation.

59:38.493 --> 59:41.037
The inner sanctum
of the entire operation?

59:44.916 --> 59:45.959
Yes.

59:54.842 --> 59:56.301
This is it?

59:56.468 --> 59:57.928
Of course not. I lied.

59:58.095 --> 59:59.388
He does that.

59:59.555 --> 01:00:02.516
I'm going to kill you,
and then I'm going to kill your partner.

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:04.476
I don't know who you're talking about.

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:13.277
Ah. Mrs. Shpilkes must be lost.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:16.697
I think it's only fair to warn you,
this facility is surrounded...

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:19.783
...by a highly trained team
of 130 Black Op snipers.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.910
- I don't believe you.
- Would you believe...

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:24.079
...two dozen Delta Force commandos?

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:26.790
- No.
- How about Chuck Norris with a BB gun?

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.792
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:35.174
Well, Mr. Shtarker,
I think you've underestimated me...

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.342
...and the element of surpr...!

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:50.147
99, we've been compromised. Get out.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:11.709
Access denied,

01:01:41.572 --> 01:01:44.075
Access denied, Access denied,

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:46.744
Access denied,

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:00.800
Max, where are you?

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:03.218
99, I found the yellowcake.

01:02:03.385 --> 01:02:05.053
Of course you did, it's a bakery.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.889
No, not yellow "cake" cake,
yellowcake uranium.

01:02:08.056 --> 01:02:12.561
Although there is yellow "cake" cake
here as well.

01:02:13.395 --> 01:02:14.646
Oh, Max.

01:02:42.424 --> 01:02:44.009
Max, do you read...?

01:02:44.176 --> 01:02:45.469
99!

01:02:45.635 --> 01:02:47.471
What happened to your radio?

01:02:47.637 --> 01:02:50.640
I swallowed it. I can get it back,
but you may not want it.

01:02:50.807 --> 01:02:52.642
- Good Lord.
- Listen...

01:02:52.809 --> 01:02:54.060
...I've placed charges
at points all over the building.

01:02:54.095 --> 01:02:55.312
...I've placed charges
at points all over the building.

01:02:55.479 --> 01:02:59.191
What? Max, you can't blow up a building
full of radioactive material!

01:02:59.357 --> 01:03:03.278
I know that, 99. I've placed only enough
charges to safely bury the weapons lab.

01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:05.489
Max, that's brilliant.

01:03:05.655 --> 01:03:09.492
Wow. That's maybe the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

01:03:37.853 --> 01:03:41.816
- I don't get it, I thought he was dead!
- I will say this, he is not a quitter.

01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:00.835
This is just ridiculous!

01:04:07.049 --> 01:04:08.050
99!

01:04:08.217 --> 01:04:09.385
Wake up, 99.

01:04:09.552 --> 01:04:11.719
Maybe you should kiss him again.

01:04:14.639 --> 01:04:17.934
Wait, I know that voice.
The chatter! Dalip.

01:04:25.733 --> 01:04:26.901
Ow! That was me!

01:04:30.822 --> 01:04:32.866
- Max?
- I'm... Yep, still fighting.

01:04:51.926 --> 01:04:56.431
Now, Dalip, I can prove that I know you.
Your favorite dish is chicken tikka!

01:04:57.182 --> 01:05:00.226
Like me, you enjoy
American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest,

01:05:14.449 --> 01:05:15.262
Ow.

01:05:15.297 --> 01:05:16.074
Ow.

01:05:25.918 --> 01:05:29.087
Wait, wait, Dalip,
there's something else that I know.

01:05:29.254 --> 01:05:30.422
Max. Max.

01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:34.301
Your marriage is in trouble.
Your darling wife, Zeenat, is leaving you.

01:05:34.927 --> 01:05:37.137
But there is still hope.

01:05:37.304 --> 01:05:38.764
Do you love her?

01:05:43.977 --> 01:05:47.815
- Wha...?
- Then show her. Go home for lunch.

01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:50.567
Take her with you the next time
you go to kill someone.

01:05:50.984 --> 01:05:52.569
She just wants to be with you...

01:05:52.736 --> 01:05:54.988
...and that means
less time with her sister...

01:05:55.155 --> 01:05:57.866
...who we both know is undermining
your relationship.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.161
Kick the gun to me.

01:06:01.328 --> 01:06:02.871
99, please.

01:06:03.622 --> 01:06:05.165
Big people feel pain too.

01:06:17.344 --> 01:06:18.679
What are you doing?

01:06:19.471 --> 01:06:21.848
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:06:22.014 --> 01:06:23.683
Max!

01:06:26.018 --> 01:06:30.690
Okay. Okay. That's all right. That's okay.

01:06:32.775 --> 01:06:35.945
Her sister's such a bitch.

01:06:43.494 --> 01:06:45.788
- You all right?
- Yeah. That was amazing.

01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:48.458
Thank you.

01:06:50.543 --> 01:06:52.086
We gotta go.

01:07:00.636 --> 01:07:01.679
99.

01:07:08.519 --> 01:07:11.230
- What was that?
- I cramped up.

01:07:13.733 --> 01:07:15.234
Come on. Come here.

01:07:15.568 --> 01:07:17.236
Good idea.

01:07:17.403 --> 01:07:21.157
We will climb up with you,
and we'll all go... together.

01:07:31.124 --> 01:07:32.459
He left us here.

01:07:32.793 --> 01:07:34.419
What a douche.

01:07:52.145 --> 01:07:55.065
Missed it by that much.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:01.780
Well, that's convenient. Shoot them.

01:08:10.288 --> 01:08:12.624
Whatever you do, 99, don't look down!

01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:16.419
I'm gonna try to get us over to that ledge!
We can do this, 99!

01:08:17.754 --> 01:08:18.796
Max.

01:08:19.464 --> 01:08:20.465
Right.

01:08:25.303 --> 01:08:26.555
Thanks, Chief.

01:08:27.139 --> 01:08:28.682
Okay, no problem.

01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:31.684
The Chief is thrilled.
He sent 23 out to observe the cleanup.

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:32.893
Great.

01:08:34.103 --> 01:08:38.357
Listen, is it possible that you could
answer a personal question?

01:08:38.524 --> 01:08:40.359
It's possible.

01:08:41.193 --> 01:08:43.319
Why did you change your looks?

01:08:44.446 --> 01:08:48.075
Oh. Um...
That's not really a personal question.

01:08:48.367 --> 01:08:51.871
Things from my non-work sphere
spilled into my work sphere.

01:08:52.037 --> 01:08:56.000
Facts became known, identities were
compromised, and I became a brunette.

01:08:56.167 --> 01:08:59.211
Wow. That is a great story...

01:08:59.377 --> 01:09:02.798
...in which you revealed
absolutely nothing about yourself.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.846
I blew a mission.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:16.312
I was involved with someone from work.
I lost focus. The mission blew up.

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:20.941
I broke it off with that person,
but my identity had already been revealed.

01:09:21.108 --> 01:09:22.693
So I had two choices.

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:25.529
I could either spend the rest of my life
behind a desk...

01:09:26.404 --> 01:09:28.365
...which would be like
eight hours a day...

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:31.243
...of scraping a cheese grater
against my forehead.

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:33.245
- Oh, you know.
- Yes.

01:09:33.412 --> 01:09:36.038
Or I could change my face,
so that's what I did.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:43.546
And it was painful,
but it needed to be done, and s...

01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:51.304
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
- Okay.

01:09:54.766 --> 01:09:57.060
I used to look like my mom.

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:05.401
I used to look like
two of my moms put together.

01:10:43.647 --> 01:10:46.483
Sir, if I may ask...

01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:48.819
...how did you choose the target?

01:10:48.986 --> 01:10:51.363
- Why Los Ãngeles?
- Major city...

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.407
...lots of media attention...

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:55.451
...and the president will be there.

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:59.246
Still, it's too bad
about all the dead movie stars.

01:10:59.413 --> 01:11:00.706
Yes.

01:11:00.873 --> 01:11:05.252
What will we do without
their razor-sharp political advice?

01:11:09.756 --> 01:11:12.843
Oh, my God, have you eaten the crew?

01:11:13.343 --> 01:11:15.929
Oh, look, it understands.

01:11:16.096 --> 01:11:17.764
Get back to work.

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:38.160
No, that's not possible.
No, no, no. Max said that...

01:11:40.621 --> 01:11:41.789
No.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.460
That doesn't make any sense.

01:11:49.212 --> 01:11:52.173
Yellowcake uranium, warheads,
an entire production line.

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.301
There's nothing here
but what used to be a bakery.

01:11:55.468 --> 01:11:58.012
There are no weapons?
No radioactivity of any kind?

01:11:58.179 --> 01:12:00.973
Nothing. I've swept the entire area,
and it's clean.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.352
- But Max said that he s...
- Did you see the evidence yourself?

01:12:04.852 --> 01:12:06.187
No.

01:12:06.562 --> 01:12:09.357
No, every time he found something,
he was alone.

01:12:15.571 --> 01:12:17.365
What do you want me to do with Max?

01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:19.033
- Do with Max?
- Max?

01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:24.163
You were right when you said
I shouldn't trust you.

01:12:25.998 --> 01:12:27.208
Give me the phone.

01:12:31.504 --> 01:12:33.965
And who might this be? Siegfried?

01:12:34.132 --> 01:12:35.299
Hello, Max,

01:12:35.466 --> 01:12:36.509
Chief?

01:12:38.928 --> 01:12:40.721
Knockout gas, 99?

01:12:40.888 --> 01:12:44.225
Please. I have trained my body
to be impervious to...

01:12:44.392 --> 01:12:45.726
That's the new stuff.

01:12:48.687 --> 01:12:50.230
Oh, Max.

01:12:57.612 --> 01:12:59.656
I'm very disappointed, Max.

01:12:59.823 --> 01:13:02.742
I thought you and I were supposedly
cut from the same cloth.

01:13:02.909 --> 01:13:05.078
How can you think
that I am a double agent?

01:13:05.245 --> 01:13:07.747
You lied about finding evidence
of radioactivity.

01:13:07.914 --> 01:13:10.208
Killed Krstic before
anybody could question him.

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:13.587
There's a matter of your stoving
my head in with a fire extinguisher.

01:13:13.753 --> 01:13:15.901
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me,
because you were in a mini coma.

01:13:15.936 --> 01:13:18.049
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me,
because you were in a mini coma.

01:13:18.216 --> 01:13:19.926
You've made CONTROL a laughingstock.

01:13:20.093 --> 01:13:22.888
The vice president wants to shut us down,
you know.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.683
99.

01:13:27.392 --> 01:13:28.977
This whole week...

01:13:29.603 --> 01:13:30.896
...last night...

01:13:31.813 --> 01:13:33.023
...you know me.

01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:34.608
Apparently not.

01:13:35.442 --> 01:13:36.610
Oh, my God!

01:13:36.777 --> 01:13:38.904
You two? You and Max?

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:41.782
You said we had to break up
because we work together.

01:13:41.948 --> 01:13:43.116
Oh, my God! You and 23?

01:13:43.742 --> 01:13:46.203
I am so sexually threatened right now.

01:13:51.665 --> 01:13:53.167
You have reached...

01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:55.211
... the United States
Department of Homeland Security,

01:13:55.377 --> 01:13:57.838
For threats against
the continental United States, press 1,

01:13:58.005 --> 01:14:00.800
For threats against Hawaii, press 2,
For threats against Puerto Rico...,

01:14:02.468 --> 01:14:05.888
You know, you're the only human being
I know who snores when he's awake?

01:14:06.055 --> 01:14:07.681
If you're calling from a rotary...,

01:14:07.848 --> 01:14:10.476
Okay, today's threat assessment.

01:14:10.643 --> 01:14:15.147
- There are 72 threats on the list. Mike?
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

01:14:15.314 --> 01:14:18.567
Okay, we have a deteriorating situation
in Venezuela.

01:14:18.734 --> 01:14:21.320
We have a deteriorating situation
in Afghanistan.

01:14:21.487 --> 01:14:24.156
What about the deteriorating situation
in North Korea?

01:14:24.323 --> 01:14:26.200
- I was getting to that.
- When? Next week?

01:14:26.367 --> 01:14:28.702
Yes, next Tuesday,
right after I kick your ass.

01:14:28.869 --> 01:14:33.124
Gentlemen, when we argue,
the terrorists win.

01:14:36.585 --> 01:14:39.338
Anyway, last night at a private dinner...

01:14:39.505 --> 01:14:43.217
...President Kim Jong-il
made a very odd threat to, and I quote:

01:14:43.384 --> 01:14:46.011
"Make a pudding from the bones
of Americans."

01:14:46.178 --> 01:14:48.013
That guy's insane.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:52.184
Doesn't he know bones are crunchy?
Who'd want a crunchy pudding?

01:14:54.228 --> 01:14:55.271
War room.

01:14:55.437 --> 01:14:59.441
Finally. My name is Siegfried,
and I represent KAOS.

01:14:59.607 --> 01:15:00.942
Over the past few months...

01:15:01.109 --> 01:15:03.820
... we have assembled
a stockpile of nuclear weapons...

01:15:03.987 --> 01:15:08.867
... which we have distributed
to 20 unfriendly, unstable dictators,

01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:12.912
For the moment, KAOS retains
the bomb activation codes...

01:15:13.079 --> 01:15:17.000
...but we will release the codes
unless our demands are met.

01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:18.209
What are your demands?

01:15:18.376 --> 01:15:20.462
200 billion dollars by 3 p.m.

01:15:20.628 --> 01:15:23.173
200 billion dollars by 3 p. M?

01:15:23.339 --> 01:15:24.716
You seem a bit slow,

01:15:24.883 --> 01:15:28.094
- Is there someone else I can talk to?
- Good one.

01:15:28.678 --> 01:15:31.389
Look, Siegfried,
we don't negotiate with terrorists...

01:15:31.556 --> 01:15:33.892
...and you're obviously bluffing.
Take a hike.

01:15:34.058 --> 01:15:35.727
What? Are you kidding me?

01:15:35.894 --> 01:15:39.522
You spent the morning talking about
pudding, and you ignore a credible threat?

01:15:39.689 --> 01:15:42.150
Credible? Come on.
KAOS has been defunct for 20 years.

01:15:42.317 --> 01:15:44.861
With all due respect,
the CIA knows nothing about KAOS.

01:15:45.028 --> 01:15:47.447
CONTROL has to be in charge here.

01:15:47.614 --> 01:15:50.617
- Like when you bombed that bakery?
- Muffins of mass destruction.

01:15:52.494 --> 01:15:54.662
That's it!
I've been waiting for this since Nixon.

01:15:54.829 --> 01:15:58.082
- Here we go.
- I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!

01:15:58.249 --> 01:16:00.293
- Okay!
- Okay! Come on!

01:16:03.587 --> 01:16:06.215
It seems like they don't believe you.

01:16:06.757 --> 01:16:11.094
Which is why we've arranged
for a little demonstration.

01:16:59.101 --> 01:17:00.894
Chief, you wanted to see me?

01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:04.481
Yes. You and 23 are coming with me
to see the president.

01:17:04.648 --> 01:17:07.358
- Can't you call him?
- Vice president won't let me through.

01:17:07.775 --> 01:17:10.611
I can't believe we have to go
all the way to Los Ãngeles.

01:17:10.778 --> 01:17:12.613
Why is the president never here?

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.324
I'm sure whatever he's doing
is vital to the nation.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.577
"Good night, moon.

01:17:18.327 --> 01:17:21.289
Good night,
cow jumping over the moon."

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:25.585
Actually, I think you would suck
as my teacher.

01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:28.254
Well, from wh...

01:17:29.172 --> 01:17:31.924
Hey, Smart. Happy birthday.

01:17:39.182 --> 01:17:40.933
I'm fat!

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:52.320
Gentlemen.

01:17:54.572 --> 01:17:57.366
Oh. Good, the itchy kind.

01:17:57.533 --> 01:17:58.659
My favorite.

01:17:58.826 --> 01:18:00.620
Does this one also have smallpox?

01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:05.917
And that was a human tooth.

01:18:06.083 --> 01:18:09.795
American Top 40,
With Ryan Seacrest,

01:18:09.961 --> 01:18:12.798
Here's a sweet dedication
from a little lady named Dalip,

01:18:12.964 --> 01:18:14.424
It's to her boyfriend, Max,

01:18:14.591 --> 01:18:19.137
"Meet me in L.A.
Things will be very hot, Nuclear hot,"

01:18:19.304 --> 01:18:22.682
I don 't know, if I were Max,
I would get myself to L.A.

01:18:32.484 --> 01:18:34.861
Hey! Dumb guards!

01:18:35.028 --> 01:18:39.241
Why don't you come in here so I can
make you my pretty little girlfriends.

01:18:39.407 --> 01:18:40.909
You'll have to shower for weeks!

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.913
But you will never get the smell off...

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.290
You two seem very angry.

01:18:49.042 --> 01:18:51.169
Thank you, sir, may I have another?

01:18:53.463 --> 01:18:55.090
I was kidding.

01:19:03.181 --> 01:19:06.768
9-4-3-6-8.

01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:13.316
9-4-3-6-8.

01:19:30.374 --> 01:19:32.126
Turn around slowly.

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:37.631
Guys, you have to believe me.
I am not a double agent.

01:19:37.798 --> 01:19:40.301
- We never thought you were.
- Yeah, we love you, man.

01:19:40.468 --> 01:19:43.262
Then what's with the firearm
and the freak-show expressions?

01:19:43.429 --> 01:19:44.805
For the security cameras.

01:19:44.972 --> 01:19:48.267
If it looks like we let you go,
we'd totally get fired.

01:19:48.434 --> 01:19:49.477
Got it.

01:19:52.146 --> 01:19:53.606
So where are the Chief and 99?

01:19:53.773 --> 01:19:55.733
They flew to L.A.
To talk to the president.

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:58.319
I need to get out of here
before someone stops me.

01:19:58.486 --> 01:20:00.070
- Overpower us.
- Good idea.

01:20:00.237 --> 01:20:01.906
Bruce, I will smash you in the face.

01:20:02.072 --> 01:20:04.658
- Thank you.
- Lloyd, I'll simulate your disembowelment.

01:20:04.825 --> 01:20:06.368
Ready? One...

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.954
Not yet! I haven't punched yet.
React when I punch.

01:20:09.121 --> 01:20:10.498
- Oh, yeah.
- One...

01:20:10.664 --> 01:20:12.416
...two, three.

01:20:13.834 --> 01:20:15.503
- Wrong way.
- Okay, wait.

01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:18.130
- Sometimes I faint.
- I'm not going to hit you.

01:20:18.296 --> 01:20:21.883
No, but when I see blood, or when
I talk about blood, or think about blood...

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:24.719
There will be no blood.
Hang in there. Hang in, buddy.

01:21:12.058 --> 01:21:13.726
What are you doing, dummkopf?

01:21:13.893 --> 01:21:17.647
Running out in the middle of the road!
You could get hit by a car!

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:20.650
Well, that was ironic.

01:21:34.913 --> 01:21:36.415
Chief, I'm not buying it.

01:21:36.582 --> 01:21:39.585
With all our satellites,
there's no way anybody could possibly...

01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:42.045
...have nuclear bombs
that we wouldn't know about.

01:21:42.212 --> 01:21:43.589
"Nuclear!"

01:21:44.006 --> 01:21:45.591
- What's that?
- Sorry.

01:21:45.757 --> 01:21:49.094
Mr. President, if I could just
please show you some data, you'd agree...

01:21:49.261 --> 01:21:50.762
Well, just back up here a second.

01:21:50.929 --> 01:21:52.931
First thing I'd like to know is...

01:21:53.098 --> 01:21:55.267
...what did the vice president
say about this?

01:21:55.434 --> 01:21:59.188
I'm afraid the vice president and I had
a less-than-cordial encounter yesterday.

01:21:59.354 --> 01:22:01.106
- Less-than-cordial, you say?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:01.273 --> 01:22:02.316
I'll say.

01:22:03.692 --> 01:22:06.403
The chairman of joint chiefs
sent me this little movie.

01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:08.238
Put it right here on my cell phone.

01:22:08.405 --> 01:22:10.407
Let me share this with you.
This is my favorite part.

01:22:10.574 --> 01:22:13.076
I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!

01:22:14.953 --> 01:22:16.121
Oh, Chief.

01:22:16.288 --> 01:22:17.456
Very sweet tackle.

01:22:17.623 --> 01:22:20.125
Look. Look at the surprise on his face.

01:22:20.292 --> 01:22:22.628
I probably owe you an apology
for that, sir.

01:22:22.795 --> 01:22:24.421
No. Please, just save your breath.

01:22:24.588 --> 01:22:26.840
But I have to agree
with that son of a bitch.

01:22:27.007 --> 01:22:29.342
We cannot respond to every threat.

01:22:30.718 --> 01:22:32.136
Case closed.

01:22:55.743 --> 01:22:56.786
Max?

01:22:56.953 --> 01:22:58.079
Hello, 99,

01:22:58.246 --> 01:23:00.081
Trace 99's call, now!

01:23:00.248 --> 01:23:02.125
- Where are you?
- That's not important,

01:23:02.291 --> 01:23:04.710
What is important
is that KAOS has planted a bomb...

01:23:04.877 --> 01:23:06.170
... somewhere in Los Ãngeles,

01:23:06.337 --> 01:23:08.339
We got him. He's still in Washington.

01:23:08.506 --> 01:23:11.759
Listen, while I was in my cell,
I had some time to think,

01:23:13.886 --> 01:23:18.975
I realized that even though I was accused
of something I didn 't do, I was happy,

01:23:19.392 --> 01:23:24.272
Because at least for a little while,
I got to live my dream of being an agent,

01:23:25.273 --> 01:23:27.024
And I got to be with you,

01:23:27.191 --> 01:23:30.027
I learned that you have
a mean right cross...

01:23:30.194 --> 01:23:33.405
... you are almost as good
a dancer as me...

01:23:33.572 --> 01:23:36.825
- ... and you used to look like your mom,
- Max.

01:23:36.992 --> 01:23:40.328
Please, 99, All I'm asking is for you
to look me in the eyes...

01:23:40.495 --> 01:23:43.081
... and tell me that
you don 't feel something too,

01:23:43.874 --> 01:23:45.041
Freeze!

01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:48.962
Oh, Max.
How could I look in your eyes?

01:23:50.338 --> 01:23:51.590
Just turn around.

01:23:59.014 --> 01:24:01.016
Why are you talking into your shoe?

01:24:01.183 --> 01:24:04.561
The old "call forwarding
from the shoe phone to the cell phone...

01:24:04.728 --> 01:24:08.064
...so you don't know where I am,
then I appear on the roof behind you...

01:24:08.231 --> 01:24:10.233
...and surprise everyone" trick.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.277
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

01:24:12.444 --> 01:24:13.487
How did you get here?

01:24:16.656 --> 01:24:18.742
Do you have another one of these?

01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:23.580
It doesn't matter.

01:24:23.747 --> 01:24:26.750
What matters is that there is a bomb,
and I'm here to find it.

01:24:26.917 --> 01:24:29.085
- How do you know this?
- I'd rather not say.

01:24:29.252 --> 01:24:31.254
Max, there are millions of lives at stake.

01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:34.591
If you have credible information
from a reliable source...

01:24:34.758 --> 01:24:36.967
...I wanna know it,
and I wanna know it now.

01:24:38.052 --> 01:24:40.930
I heard it from America's sweetheart,
Ryan Seacrest.

01:24:41.097 --> 01:24:42.431
- Whoa.
Come on.

01:24:42.598 --> 01:24:44.183
It was a coded message.

01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:47.728
Max, we're running out of time
here. What are you talking about?

01:24:47.895 --> 01:24:51.732
I received a tip from a KAOS agent
who I befriended at the bakery.

01:24:57.238 --> 01:24:58.989
I think we should trust him, Chief.

01:24:59.156 --> 01:25:01.117
Absolutely, Chief.
I'm with 99 on that one.

01:25:01.283 --> 01:25:04.120
Every time I look at Max's puppy eyes,
I'm a goner.

01:25:04.286 --> 01:25:08.082
Oh, my God. You've really never
had anyone break up with you, have you?

01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:12.545
Chief, you said that you and I are alike.

01:25:12.711 --> 01:25:15.089
That we are both old-fashioned men.

01:25:15.756 --> 01:25:17.883
Well, I have an old-fashioned hunch.

01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:22.638
I have a hunch that you have a hunch
that I am telling the truth.

01:25:23.722 --> 01:25:24.807
Max...

01:25:26.267 --> 01:25:29.478
Any double agent who escapes
from a high-security holding situation...

01:25:29.645 --> 01:25:33.274
...only to fall into the arms of
the people that got him in the first place...

01:25:33.441 --> 01:25:37.236
...is either an idiot or not a double agent,
and I don't think you're an idiot.

01:25:37.987 --> 01:25:39.029
Thank you, Chief.

01:25:39.655 --> 01:25:42.991
Now, we know that the president
is in town.

01:25:43.158 --> 01:25:46.995
- But what exactly is he doing here today?
- Max.

01:25:47.162 --> 01:25:51.458
- Yes. We need to find out his itinerary.
- But, Max, the...

01:25:51.624 --> 01:25:54.335
I know, 99. I need to go get a paper.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.263
We're in position. More or less.

01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:08.349
Roger. I have the whole
security system online. Just remember...

01:26:08.516 --> 01:26:12.312
Yes, we know.
How about a little radio silence?

01:26:12.479 --> 01:26:14.481
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

01:26:14.516 --> 01:26:16.483
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

01:26:16.649 --> 01:26:21.112
By the way, I reviewed the security tapes
from the explosion at the bakery...

01:26:21.279 --> 01:26:25.325
...and I know that you let those
CONTROL agents get away.

01:26:25.492 --> 01:26:27.744
So unless you do your job today...

01:26:27.911 --> 01:26:34.042
...your lovely wife, Zeenat,
will have eaten her last kebab.

01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:59.650
Blue team, check for access violation
at quadrant three, sector seven,

01:26:59.817 --> 01:27:00.859
Copy that.

01:27:02.236 --> 01:27:03.403
Go.

01:27:20.879 --> 01:27:22.589
That's it. You're there.

01:27:54.328 --> 01:27:56.080
Door secure.

01:28:28.613 --> 01:28:30.865
We need to get everyone out
and shut this place.

01:28:31.032 --> 01:28:32.492
We've swept the building.

01:28:32.658 --> 01:28:36.454
The Secret Service doesn't make mistakes
like the fabulous bakery boys.

01:28:36.621 --> 01:28:38.539
Who told you about that? Who told you?

01:28:38.706 --> 01:28:41.000
Take it easy.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

01:28:41.167 --> 01:28:43.795
And this day will not include
me blowing into your mouth.

01:28:43.961 --> 01:28:46.964
- You want a piece of me?
- Come on, Chief! He's not worth it.

01:28:47.131 --> 01:28:48.758
- Hey.
- I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

01:28:48.925 --> 01:28:49.967
You better watch it.

01:28:50.134 --> 01:28:51.636
Let me at him!

01:29:01.019 --> 01:29:02.938
From Los Ãngeles, California...

01:29:03.105 --> 01:29:04.043
... we welcome you to a live broadcast...

01:29:04.078 --> 01:29:04.981
... we welcome you to a live broadcast...

01:29:05.148 --> 01:29:07.150
... of our concert for the president,

01:29:07.317 --> 01:29:09.778
Dignitaries from around the world
have gathered,

01:29:09.945 --> 01:29:12.906
We will be broadcasting
from the Walt Disney Concert Hall...

01:29:13.073 --> 01:29:14.366
... throughout the evening,

01:29:14.533 --> 01:29:16.993
There has got to be another way in.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.038
Why are we even still here?
There are 50 other perfect targets.

01:29:20.205 --> 01:29:23.625
The Golden Gate Bridge, Space Needle.
There's no chatter to support this.

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:26.586
And you know what,
I'm done with this. Stop!

01:29:26.753 --> 01:29:30.215
Wait a minute, 23.
You're radioactive hot.

01:29:30.382 --> 01:29:32.467
When were you exposed to radioactivity?

01:29:32.634 --> 01:29:35.929
I just got back from Russia.
Half the people there are radioactive.

01:29:36.096 --> 01:29:37.139
The bakery.

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:39.933
You said you swept the area
and everything was clean.

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:42.519
- I did, and it was.
Really?

01:29:42.686 --> 01:29:45.272
Was there anyone else there,
or do we just trust you?

01:29:45.730 --> 01:29:46.773
23.

01:29:47.941 --> 01:29:49.651
Your knife wound is seeping.

01:29:50.235 --> 01:29:52.070
Sudden rise in blood pressure?

01:29:52.237 --> 01:29:55.574
Perhaps you're nervous because
there is a bomb here and you know it.

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:59.243
And what is with the briefcase?
Could that actually be the football?

01:29:59.410 --> 01:30:02.413
You mean the computer
containing the bomb activation codes?

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.417
Exactly. I have no interest in a real football
unless it is signed by Joe Montana...

01:30:06.584 --> 01:30:08.794
...and I don't believe that's the case.

01:30:10.546 --> 01:30:12.298
Well, 23?

01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:15.134
You know what? We're out of time.

01:30:16.635 --> 01:30:18.721
You follow us, she dies.

01:30:28.522 --> 01:30:30.232
Stop this car!

01:30:30.608 --> 01:30:34.028
Max! You idiot!
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:37.531
You don't just slap your hands
on a government vehicle!

01:30:39.074 --> 01:30:43.412
All right, that's it! When we get back
to Washington, you morons are through!

01:30:46.582 --> 01:30:50.044
Damn it. How have you gotten
away with this for so long?

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:52.588
I can't believe none of us saw it,
especially me.

01:30:52.755 --> 01:30:55.132
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll be dead soon anyway.

01:30:57.676 --> 01:30:59.762
Chief, he's heading
southbound on Grand.

01:30:59.929 --> 01:31:01.514
Thanks, Bruce. Keep us posted.

01:31:02.139 --> 01:31:05.809
Hey! CONTROL
assholes who just stole my vehicle!

01:31:05.975 --> 01:31:10.396
I know you're listening! You two dickwads
put one scratch on that car...,

01:31:11.606 --> 01:31:12.982
What was that?

01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:14.901
Sorry, I'm losing you.

01:31:15.652 --> 01:31:16.694
What the...?

01:31:18.154 --> 01:31:20.657
All right, fellas.
20 dollars if you hit the car.

01:31:22.659 --> 01:31:26.496
Chief, I have to say,
this whole thing really steams my clams.

01:31:26.663 --> 01:31:29.374
I cannot get over the fact
that 23 is a traitor.

01:31:29.541 --> 01:31:30.959
Sand trap!

01:31:31.126 --> 01:31:33.962
Now I know how you felt
when you thought I was a traitor.

01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:35.380
Tractor!

01:31:35.547 --> 01:31:38.425
I don't know how I missed it.
I'm usually very observant.

01:31:38.591 --> 01:31:39.926
Swordfish!

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.519
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I don't know.

01:31:49.686 --> 01:31:53.523
Were you thinking, "Holy shit, holy shit, a
swordfish almost went through my head?"

01:31:53.690 --> 01:31:55.233
If so, yes.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.693
Come on.

01:32:19.089 --> 01:32:20.883
On behalf
of the United States Government...

01:32:21.049 --> 01:32:22.801
...I hereby commandeer this plane.

01:32:23.719 --> 01:32:25.596
The device is armed.
I hope you're moving.

01:32:25.763 --> 01:32:28.724
Don't worry, sir. I'll be well clear.

01:32:33.228 --> 01:32:35.147
Chief, they're headed
southbound on I-47,

01:32:35.314 --> 01:32:37.149
Thanks, Bruce. I got them!

01:32:38.025 --> 01:32:39.735
I need to get down to that car!

01:32:39.902 --> 01:32:43.405
No, no good. If I get too low,
he'll hear me coming!

01:32:47.242 --> 01:32:49.203
I have another idea.

01:32:50.037 --> 01:32:51.705
What are you doing?

01:32:54.208 --> 01:32:56.919
Get back in the plane!
You're gonna kill yourself!

01:32:58.212 --> 01:32:59.505
Hang on!

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:17.605
Hang on! We're going in!

01:33:22.401 --> 01:33:23.528
Sorry, Max.

01:33:29.117 --> 01:33:31.786
Tuesday's not gonna work.
Cannot do Tuesday, I'm already...

01:33:31.953 --> 01:33:33.955
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Sean! Sean! Sean!

01:33:34.122 --> 01:33:36.124
See how annoying that is?

01:33:56.477 --> 01:33:58.416
See, this is your problem.
Some men like women more feminine!

01:33:58.451 --> 01:34:00.356
See, this is your problem.
Some men like women more feminine!

01:34:00.523 --> 01:34:01.983
- I'm not feminine?
- No.

01:34:02.150 --> 01:34:03.317
I'm not feminine?

01:34:14.162 --> 01:34:15.204
Freeze!

01:34:16.038 --> 01:34:17.748
That was so cool.

01:34:18.665 --> 01:34:20.000
Max!

01:34:28.508 --> 01:34:29.509
Damn it to hell.

01:34:39.352 --> 01:34:41.480
You know, I might be more help
if you untie me!

01:34:41.730 --> 01:34:44.107
There's a knife in my right front pocket!

01:34:50.572 --> 01:34:51.823
Stop it! Stop it!

01:34:52.282 --> 01:34:53.325
What?

01:34:54.534 --> 01:34:57.162
That's not my knife! That's not my...

01:34:57.704 --> 01:34:58.997
I got it!

01:35:05.712 --> 01:35:07.380
No, 99, don't touch that!

01:35:10.717 --> 01:35:12.219
Oh, my Lord.

01:35:33.906 --> 01:35:35.991
Yeah! The kid's still got it.

01:35:41.789 --> 01:35:42.832
Max, hurry!

01:35:44.917 --> 01:35:46.669
Hold on, 99!

01:35:52.716 --> 01:35:56.595
Chief, we can't stop the car! We have the
football, but we do not know the code!

01:35:56.762 --> 01:35:58.222
We need to figure out something!

01:35:58.389 --> 01:36:01.225
These tracks are taking us back
downtown, towards the bomb!

01:36:05.646 --> 01:36:08.524
We gotta get you out of there,
and you won't survive the jump!

01:36:08.691 --> 01:36:09.733
I'm coming to get you!

01:36:34.758 --> 01:36:36.801
- Oh, God!
- Hold on, 99!

01:36:38.303 --> 01:36:41.097
It's not over, Max!
I'll take that briefcase!

01:36:41.264 --> 01:36:43.308
If you want it, you'll have to take it!

01:36:43.767 --> 01:36:47.312
- That's what I just said!
- I know, I'm just trying to annoy you!

01:37:36.026 --> 01:37:37.903
Unusual but effective.

01:37:45.702 --> 01:37:47.621
- You all right?
- I'm fine!

01:37:53.919 --> 01:37:55.379
Max!

01:37:56.088 --> 01:37:57.131
Max, your foot!

01:38:03.053 --> 01:38:06.056
- I wish we had more time!
- What?

01:38:26.410 --> 01:38:29.580
- Max!
- No!

01:38:50.433 --> 01:38:51.893
Oh, Max.

01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:59.442
No. No!

01:39:05.114 --> 01:39:07.575
I wish we had more time too.

01:39:10.286 --> 01:39:12.080
So you did hear me?

01:39:14.874 --> 01:39:15.917
Max?

01:39:20.088 --> 01:39:21.923
But the train...

01:39:22.924 --> 01:39:25.134
Missed it by that much.

01:39:44.444 --> 01:39:46.321
"Operation Joy"?

01:39:47.823 --> 01:39:51.660
The "Ode to Joy" will end with a bang.

01:39:56.748 --> 01:39:59.918
- Chief!
- Yeah, Maxie! Are you okay?

01:40:00.085 --> 01:40:04.172
Listen, I think the final notes
of the "Ode to Joy" trigger the bomb!

01:40:04.339 --> 01:40:06.133
We have to stop the concert!

01:40:06.299 --> 01:40:07.592
I'm on it.

01:40:44.086 --> 01:40:47.673
My buttocks are really stinging
from being dragged.

01:40:56.891 --> 01:40:59.351
Hey, grandpa, I already told you...

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:03.272
Speak up, son.
I'm an old man, you know.

01:41:14.533 --> 01:41:16.786
I like that tackling part.

01:41:21.082 --> 01:41:23.876
I am so, so sorry about that.

01:41:24.043 --> 01:41:25.836
Wait! No, no, let him go.

01:41:26.796 --> 01:41:28.923
- There is a bomb.
- Where?

01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:32.093
Would you believe in the piano?

01:41:37.389 --> 01:41:39.767
Whoa. How did we miss that?
That is huge.

01:41:40.226 --> 01:41:44.730
- Max. Was that...?
- A total guess, yes, it was.

01:41:53.488 --> 01:41:55.990
That old son of a gun
can take a hit, huh?

01:42:03.331 --> 01:42:07.752
- Do you think I should tell him?
- No. Let's just savor the moment.

01:42:16.428 --> 01:42:18.763
He's a funny son of a bitch, isn't he?

01:42:19.472 --> 01:42:21.933
This is the proudest moment of my life!

01:42:24.853 --> 01:42:26.438
Bomb not go off.

01:42:26.604 --> 01:42:29.149
Oh, really, bright-eyes?
What alerted you?

01:42:29.315 --> 01:42:32.485
Was it no "Boom, boom," or the lack
of a mushroom cloud?

01:42:32.652 --> 01:42:35.321
It was the mushroom cloud for me.

01:42:36.322 --> 01:42:41.161
Well, you did your job,
so I suppose I can't kill your wife.

01:42:41.578 --> 01:42:45.165
Although to be honest,
I'd be doing the sighted world a favor.

01:42:53.630 --> 01:42:55.924
What good hang time, huh?

01:42:56.675 --> 01:42:59.887
Yes, Mr. President.
Thank you and goodbye, sir.

01:43:00.095 --> 01:43:03.640
86, the President wanted me
to convey his personal thanks...

01:43:03.807 --> 01:43:07.519
...and to tell you how impressed he was
with that dragged-by-a-train thing.

01:43:07.686 --> 01:43:11.815
Well, sir, as an agent, I have trained
myself to be impervious to pain.

01:43:13.192 --> 01:43:15.444
Ah! Hey, it's Fang.

01:43:15.611 --> 01:43:18.280
I wanted him to be a surprise.

01:43:18.447 --> 01:43:21.575
99, please, nobody here
knows that we're dating.

01:43:21.742 --> 01:43:23.327
Yes, they do.

01:43:24.578 --> 01:43:25.871
On the cheek.

01:43:26.997 --> 01:43:28.707
- Let's go.
- Maybe a little one?

01:43:29.708 --> 01:43:33.587
Hey, new guy. Hold up a second.
Welcome to CONTROL.

01:43:33.754 --> 01:43:37.007
We have a tradition called "pick on
the new guy. " Here's how it works.

01:43:37.174 --> 01:43:40.177
- We pick on the new guy.
- And you can't do anything about it.

01:43:40.344 --> 01:43:41.720
Let's try one.

01:43:42.554 --> 01:43:45.557
- You dropped your pencil.
- Did you hear the man?

01:43:45.933 --> 01:43:49.228
I don't see a man, I see two little girls.

01:43:49.394 --> 01:43:53.398
I think I'll call you Maureen,
and you Brittany.

01:43:53.565 --> 01:43:56.901
- New guy did not.
- New guy did.

01:43:57.068 --> 01:43:59.070
Okay, new guy...
I got this.

01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:01.072
And I'm going to enjoy it.

01:44:01.239 --> 01:44:03.241
That will make me happy, Maureen.

01:44:03.616 --> 01:44:04.659
Maureen.

01:44:06.119 --> 01:44:07.412
Ow! What's in there?

01:44:07.954 --> 01:44:09.789
- And just for the record.
- What's in there?

01:44:11.374 --> 01:44:12.875
My name is not "new guy."

01:44:14.085 --> 01:44:15.461
My name is Hymie.

01:44:15.628 --> 01:44:18.047
Now, if you ladies will excuse me.

01:44:20.425 --> 01:44:22.218
This is gonna be so fun.

01:44:22.385 --> 01:44:23.970
Make him high-five me.

01:44:58.337 --> 01:44:59.589
Max, we're gonna be late.

01:45:03.592 --> 01:45:06.261
Oh, Max. Let Maintenance
take care of it.

01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:11.475
Ah!

01:45:11.641 --> 01:45:13.602
You've gotta be kidding me!
