00:02.293 --> 00:04.045
Hello. I'm Freddie Highmore.

00:04.754 --> 00:07.882
The following episode
portrays our hope for the future,

00:07.966 --> 00:10.176
a future where no one
will have to wear masks

00:10.260 --> 00:12.429
or take other steps
to stay safe from COVID.

00:13.012 --> 00:16.099
Until then,
please protect yourself and others.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.562
I'm Jordan Allen.

00:20.645 --> 00:23.314
My first year in med school,
I designed an ankle brace

00:23.398 --> 00:26.192
that monitors extent of immobilization
via a phone app.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.902
When I licensed it to Bioventus,

00:27.986 --> 00:30.405
I was able to pay off
over half my student loans.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.699
John Lundberg.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.910
I've worked every summer
since I was 16 at Camp Hope Heartland,

00:35.994 --> 00:38.580
a summer program for kids
with cancer in Des Moines,

00:38.663 --> 00:39.539
where I grew up.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.458
Asher Wolke.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.959
Uh, when I was 18,

00:43.042 --> 00:46.171
I left the Hasidic community
that I was raised in.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.548
I realized if there really was a God,

00:48.631 --> 00:50.425
it had to be a cruel being

00:50.508 --> 00:52.927
that I felt nothing but contempt for.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.056
That's also when I decided
to go to med school,

00:56.139 --> 00:57.557
and start dating men.

01:01.561 --> 01:05.190
I'm Olivia Jackson. I'm 25. From Chicago.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.357
[inhales deeply]

01:07.984 --> 01:10.528
I play ragtime piano
alone in my apartment.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.574
Is that interesting?

01:14.657 --> 01:15.742
Will Hooper.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.244
Technically, I'm a professional athlete.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.830
Although in a sport
nobody pays attention to,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.500
and the stipend barely covers
our training expenses,

01:23.583 --> 01:26.377
but I'm on the US National Rowing team.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.087
Men's Eight.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.633
Hey, I'm Enrique.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.093
I spent last summer in Costa Rica,

01:34.427 --> 01:38.014
where I learned to surf, which I'm totally
obsessed with now. [chuckles]

01:38.264 --> 01:43.186
Uh, I had a pretty interesting encounter
with a saltwater crocodile.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.104
I just thought it was a big…

01:45.188 --> 01:47.398
Why are you wearing a swimsuit?

01:49.943 --> 01:52.070
Oh, they're actually hybrid boardshorts.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.614
I like to work hard,

01:54.697 --> 01:56.950
and it's easier to do
when you're comfortable.

01:57.408 --> 02:01.371
Plus, I think the casual dress
puts patients at ease.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.539
[chuckles lightly]

02:06.209 --> 02:07.293
Uh…

02:07.377 --> 02:08.878
And Dr. Lim said that the

02:09.546 --> 02:10.547
shorts were fine.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.843
Hospital policy requires all residents to…

02:14.926 --> 02:17.262
He's not a resident.
He's a resident applicant.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.514
One of six finalists for four openings.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.349
Now, they'll be shadowing for two days.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.059
Give them the tour,
show them the ropes,

02:23.143 --> 02:24.394
feel free to turn up the heat.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.937
See how they react under pressure.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.189
You will be responsible
for supervising them,

02:28.273 --> 02:30.024
so I want your totally honest input

02:30.108 --> 02:31.609
before I make any final decisions.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.694
Those shorts…

02:32.777 --> 02:34.445
Let's call them strike one.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.490
Oh, and in addition
to being an Olympian,

02:37.574 --> 02:38.950
Will Hooper is a Rhodes

02:39.033 --> 02:41.536
and graduated top of his class
at Stanford.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.246
He is very handsome.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.664
He's very full of himself.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.499
He's ranked first by every top program,

02:46.583 --> 02:49.127
so whatever you can do
to recruit him to ours, do it.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.296
I can already give you
my input on the sh…

02:51.379 --> 02:53.298
Don't judge a book by its boardshorts.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.349
-[knock on door]
-[door opens]

03:03.683 --> 03:05.435
[Dr. Reznick] You wanted to see me?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.519
Good morning.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.771
Sorry. Good morning.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.523
-[door closes]
-What'd I do wrong?

03:10.607 --> 03:11.649
Just wanted to check in.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.651
See how the new role was coming along.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.819
Honestly?

03:16.821 --> 03:19.574
You could start our new
supervisor-resident relationship

03:19.657 --> 03:20.617
with a lie.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.618
That's always fun.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.455
Internal medicine is

03:26.414 --> 03:27.248
boring.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.209
Between smokers and obese diabetics,

03:30.293 --> 03:32.962
seems like all I'm doing
is protecting people from themselves.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.130
[chuckles]

03:36.257 --> 03:37.592
As a surgical resident,

03:37.675 --> 03:39.302
you never treated drunk drivers?

03:39.385 --> 03:41.346
Or extracted random objects from guys'…

03:41.429 --> 03:43.348
I get it. People are stupid.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.557
Not my point, but true.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.184
[sighs]

03:47.435 --> 03:48.853
Not the same adrenaline rush,

03:48.937 --> 03:51.481
but internal medicine can be rewarding.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.567
Given time, if you're patient.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.111
Thanks.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.367
That is not how I thought
this meeting was gonna go.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.536
I thought one of the nurses
complained about me.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.704
Wasn't just one.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.834
And if it happens again, this meeting
will go exactly how you thought it would.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.466
[door closes]

04:24.847 --> 04:25.932
Sorry.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.892
I should've just canceled the appointment.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.018
You were right.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.770
Dizziness went away as soon as I stopped

04:30.853 --> 04:32.438
drinking coffee and Red Bull all day.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.523
No worries.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.859
-Can you lie flat on your back, please?
-Yeah.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.696
You get that scar in a fire?

04:39.779 --> 04:40.780
Sort of.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.074
A homemade Roman candle when I was 12.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.659
[chuckles] You'd be surprised

04:44.742 --> 04:47.120
how many of us at the firehouse
were pyros as kids.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.248
I made a potato gun
for my sixth-grade science fair.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.874
Almost got me kicked out of school.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.543
You'll have to come visit us sometime.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.169
[inhales sharply] You'd fit right in.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.756
[Josh] You see something?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.550
Don't talk. Just breathe normally.

05:00.633 --> 05:01.634
[machine beeps]

05:05.596 --> 05:06.597
[machine beeps]

05:08.558 --> 05:10.685
You have a large tumor
on the wall of your heart.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.187
Cancer?

05:13.271 --> 05:14.272
I don't know.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.858
But you're definitely gonna need surgery.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.151
As soon as possible.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.738
[theme music playing]

05:30.455 --> 05:33.291
I appreciate you letting me
share your case with the whole class.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.375
[Monica] No problem.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.961
I stopped being shy
after the 100th time I had to do this.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.048
I'll be using a version
of Lejour's technique I've adapted.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.383
We'll divide the breast
into three pedicles,

05:42.467 --> 05:45.178
and then redistribute the tissue
and insert saline implants

05:45.261 --> 05:47.013
to correct the tuberous breast deformity.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.724
Why would you want breast implants?

05:49.807 --> 05:52.727
You're beautiful. And your breasts look
fine just the way they are.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.479
No. No, they don't.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.564
The base is constricted,

05:56.647 --> 05:58.608
horizontal development is deficient,

05:58.691 --> 06:00.109
and the nipple-areola complex…

06:00.193 --> 06:02.487
-Murphy.
-It's okay. He's right.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.780
That's why I'm here.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.115
Thank you.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.618
I know that you're trying to be nice.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.329
My friends and family
have been telling me for years,

06:11.412 --> 06:13.289
"You're beautiful just the way you are."

06:13.372 --> 06:15.500
But I don't feel beautiful.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.418
You're 17.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.837
Every girl your age feels like that.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.506
That can't be true.

06:21.589 --> 06:24.050
Tuberous breast deformity
is a rare condition.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.718
We're not going to debate

06:25.802 --> 06:27.970
a personal decision
the patient's already made.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.682
I've been thinking
about this since I was 13.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.768
Every time I look in the mirror.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.895
I'm about to start college,

06:35.978 --> 06:38.648
and there is no way
that I'm gonna begin this new chapter

06:38.731 --> 06:39.732
until I'm fixed.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.485
[Dr. Andrews] Great.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.533
You thinking median sternotomy
or right thoracotomy?

06:48.616 --> 06:51.494
I'm thinking I should finish
my review of the imaging.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.787
Sure. No rush.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.623
Actually, there is a bit of a rush.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.542
But you know what I mean.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.294
So, newbies. What up? Where y'all from?

07:00.378 --> 07:01.379
Like hometowns, or…

07:01.462 --> 07:03.548
Med schools. Why would I care
where you grew up?

07:03.631 --> 07:04.632
Stanford.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.050
-Uh, NYU.
-Harvard.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.552
Preferred specialties?

07:07.635 --> 07:09.220
Ortho. All the way.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.430
Neuro.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.848
I'm planning a dual specialty

07:11.931 --> 07:13.599
in neonatal and pediatric oncology.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.892
Impressive. Also unlikely.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.644
I know, it's a ton of work,

07:16.727 --> 07:18.229
but I'm pretty good at multi-tasking.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.231
In med school, I did
a combined MD/PhD…

07:20.314 --> 07:21.983
-What's your mom do?
-My mom?

07:22.066 --> 07:23.067
Don't stall. Just answer.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.278
She teaches high-school French.

07:25.736 --> 07:26.737
Homemaker.

07:27.155 --> 07:27.989
Surgeon.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.657
Ouch. Dad?

07:29.740 --> 07:30.741
Also a surgeon.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.118
Double ouch. And yours?

07:32.201 --> 07:33.327
Hasidic rabbi.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.454
You've left the nest.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.330
Actually, the… the whole forest.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.875
And yours obviously
works on Wall Street.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.251
But not a trader.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.503
I'm guessing… an M&amp;A lawyer?

07:42.920 --> 07:43.963
How'd you know?

07:44.046 --> 07:45.173
She's read your resume,

07:45.256 --> 07:46.507
researched your social media.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.509
She's probably run a credit check, too.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.012
And you're under 50, but wear
Brooks Brothers button-downs.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.763
-[monitor beeps]
-Are you done yet?

07:53.222 --> 07:54.515
Left thoracotomy

07:54.599 --> 07:57.226
with a possible incision
into the right atrium

07:57.310 --> 07:59.187
and inter-atrial septum as needed.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.565
Left atrial approach through
Sondergaard's groove makes more sense.

08:02.648 --> 08:03.858
Not to me.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.569
He's my patient.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.862
But you're not a surgeon.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.573
Which is why there is
no reason for you to be grilling them,

08:10.656 --> 08:12.074
or picking the approach.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.035
Stop worrying about protecting your turf.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.161
Stop stepping all over it.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.330
You're looking at tests
I did for my patient.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.915
How am I stepping all over your turf?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.292
I think what Dr. Browne
is trying to say is,

08:21.375 --> 08:23.127
given there's no perfect approach,

08:23.211 --> 08:24.212
maybe it's best to defer

08:24.295 --> 08:26.047
to the surgical department's
recommendation.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.466
Did he just mansplain?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.676
Not at all. I…
I was just trying…

08:30.760 --> 08:32.053
So you're gonna do it again?

08:32.136 --> 08:33.179
No, I'm just trying…

08:33.262 --> 08:34.263
[both] Shut up.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.142
We're gonna go in
through a left thoracotomy.

08:38.726 --> 08:39.852
Not my preference,

08:39.936 --> 08:41.354
but it'll work.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.983
What were you thinking?
You thought you'd impress me

08:46.067 --> 08:48.945
by undermining the patient's
confidence in my judgment?

08:49.445 --> 08:51.072
I'm sorry. That wasn't my intent.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.907
And you're supposed to be a mentor now,

08:52.990 --> 08:54.450
modeling professional behavior,

08:54.534 --> 08:56.035
not making it worse, Murphy.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.121
She questioned your surgical plan.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.373
I defended it.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.791
How can we both be wrong?

09:01.874 --> 09:03.292
I don't need you to defend me.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.171
And I never wanna have a surgical debate
in front of a patient.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.799
We're not in front of the patient now.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.345
The patient's breasts
are small and a bit asymmetrical,

09:14.428 --> 09:16.639
but no woman's breasts
are perfectly shaped.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.143
You're wearing Prada shoes
and a Dolce &amp; Gabbana blouse,

09:21.227 --> 09:23.187
which cost more
than most med students' rent,

09:23.271 --> 09:24.855
so, clearly, you understand

09:24.939 --> 09:27.775
your appearance has a tremendous impact
on how people treat you.

09:27.858 --> 09:31.404
There's a difference
between nice clothes and a major surgery.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.032
And I also understand
the cosmetic surgery industry

09:35.116 --> 09:38.327
is dominated
by male physicians with a sexist bias.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.504
I've invited you to observe
as a learning opportunity.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.966
So I'd suggest less lecturing

09:52.049 --> 09:53.301
and more listening.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.055
We'll access the tumor via an incision

09:58.139 --> 09:59.849
in the chest wall between your ribs.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.518
It'll be an easier recovery
than if we opened your sternum.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.021
Are you sure
you don't want us to call your family

10:05.104 --> 10:06.272
before we put you under?

10:06.355 --> 10:08.107
Why? So they can
freak out and worry?

10:08.190 --> 10:10.693
I'd rather just give them
the good news when it's over.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.446
It is going to be good news, right?

10:14.196 --> 10:16.616
With a bit of cardiac rehab
and a positive attitude,

10:16.699 --> 10:18.075
which I know you have,

10:18.159 --> 10:20.494
you'll be back sliding
down the fire pole in no time.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.912
Our firehouse has stairs.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.414
Hmm. Bummer.

10:25.207 --> 10:28.294
[Lea] It's a social media group
where we all pretend to be ants.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.129
[Shaun] Why?

10:30.212 --> 10:33.799
Because ants don't care about politics,
sports teams,

10:33.883 --> 10:36.177
or anything else people
get so savage about.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.929
Male ants develop from unfertilized eggs,

10:39.013 --> 10:42.058
which means they don't have a father
and can't have sons.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.019
But they do have grandfathers
and can have grandsons.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.312
Interesting.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.480
And confusing.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.399
Is it just me,
or are those doctors watching us?

10:51.108 --> 10:52.860
They're the new resident applicants.

10:53.319 --> 10:57.031
They're here so Park, Claire, and I
can evaluate them for Dr. Lim.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.075
So, why are they standing over there?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.370
Park had a video chat with Kellan,

11:02.453 --> 11:04.372
and I had a real lunch with you.

11:04.455 --> 11:08.292
Shaun, you can't just
have them stand there while you eat.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.087
Part of being a good boss
is being a good host.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.005
You need to introduce them to people.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.051
Like me. Right now.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.721
Come here, please.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.684
Dr. Allen, Dr. Lundberg, Dr. Guerin,

11:25.768 --> 11:26.894
this is my girlfriend, Lea.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.687
She runs the IT department now.

11:28.771 --> 11:29.688
Okay.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.108
Nice to meet you all. Please join us.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.110
Shaun's been telling me all about you.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.862
Mm. N… No. I haven't.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.991
So, I hope Shaun's
not being too hard on you.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.284
No, he's been great.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.954
And the case we're observing
is really interesting.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.457
We're correcting
a 17-year-old girl's tuberous breasts

11:48.541 --> 11:50.084
with saline implants.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.837
Dr. Allen told Dr. Andrews
it was unethical.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.088
He got mad.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.799
I didn't say it was unethical. I just…

11:58.175 --> 11:59.802
I suppose shouldn't have interfered.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.931
Well, I don't know
what a tuberous breast is,

12:04.014 --> 12:06.225
but I think implants are way overrated.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.354
That's because your breasts are excellent.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.522
Thank you.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.524
That's exactly my point.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.901
Mine aren't huge,

12:15.985 --> 12:18.404
but every guy who's ever seen them
up close and personal

12:18.487 --> 12:19.697
has been thrilled.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.450
I definitely was.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.286
I am thrilled by every part of your body.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.624
Sorry. My bad. Total TMI.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.502
I'm not even bothered
by your adenoidal voice.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.838
Except when you talk
to your mom on the phone.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.715
But I just put on headphones.

12:42.678 --> 12:46.182
At least you'll know
he'll be a totally honest boss.

12:48.934 --> 12:49.935
[monitor beeping]

12:51.687 --> 12:54.190
[Dr. Reznick on speaker]
<i>The incision's extended superiorly</i>

12:54.273 --> 12:57.276
<i>to meet the atriotomy, and then</i>
<i>the inter-atrial septum is opened up.</i>

12:57.359 --> 12:58.360
Retractor.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.822
A Carpentier retractor
is used to visualize the mitral valve.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.241
<i>That will allow clear view of the tumor.</i>

13:04.325 --> 13:05.451
Can we turn the channel?

13:05.534 --> 13:07.578
Color commentary's getting a bit annoying.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.830
[Dr. Reznick]
<i>With the right atrium opened obliq…</i>

13:09.914 --> 13:10.873
[sighs]

13:11.957 --> 13:14.502
How's Team Browne? Any early standouts?

13:14.585 --> 13:17.046
Jackson's a bit timid, but smart.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.465
Wolke is definitely enthusiastic.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.051
And your star recruit is…

13:22.134 --> 13:23.135
[inhales deeply]

13:23.552 --> 13:25.179
pretty full of himself.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.932
I'm looking for surgeons,
and according to his recs,

13:28.015 --> 13:29.892
he can dissect and suture like a pro.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.895
I thought you were also
looking for our input.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.189
He's ranked first by every top program.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.691
You really think
they're all wrong and you're right?

13:40.319 --> 13:41.946
So, what brings you all to the biz?

13:42.363 --> 13:44.490
Had my ACL reconstructed in high school,

13:44.823 --> 13:46.450
both my rotators in college.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.869
I love the idea of fixing people,

13:49.245 --> 13:51.288
helping them be the best they can be.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.959
Surgeons are the ones
with the God complex, right?

13:57.545 --> 13:58.546
I have that.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.925
I spent my life speaking Yiddish
and studying the Talmud,

14:03.008 --> 14:04.843
and not shaving
the sides of my hair,

14:04.927 --> 14:07.054
because someone up there supposedly cares.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.390
Uh, but then I realized

14:11.141 --> 14:12.351
no one's up there.

14:13.644 --> 14:14.853
No one cares.

14:15.771 --> 14:19.441
No benevolent higher power
is going to save us, so…

14:19.525 --> 14:20.734
[inhales deeply]

14:21.277 --> 14:22.695
We have to save each other.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.949
Can you top that?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.659
-Definitely not.
-Try anyway.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.204
You're obviously smart.
You've got two degrees from Harvard.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.373
My parents are Harvard alums, so…

14:34.582 --> 14:35.875
I'm sure that helped me get in.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.127
You're not gonna get hired
by undermining your own…

14:39.253 --> 14:40.462
Something went wrong.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.756
[Olivia] Looks like
they nicked a pulmonary artery.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.717
No. If they had,
Browne would be suctioning

14:44.800 --> 14:46.635
instead of Lim reaching in with her hands.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.057
[Asher] What are they doing now?

14:52.766 --> 14:53.767
Nothing.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.603
We can't access the tumor

14:55.686 --> 14:57.938
without compromising
his entire cardiac outflow tract.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.733
What about going in the way I suggested?
The median sternotomy.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.235
The tumor's too far back.
We need to close him up.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.079
Proton beam radiation
would be too toxic to the heart.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.831
[Dr. Lim] So is immunotherapy.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.042
We can't access
the entire tumor surgically,

15:18.125 --> 15:20.753
and we can't kill it
without killing his heart along with it.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.255
What if we cut out
the parts we can access

15:23.339 --> 15:25.758
and try our luck
with chemo on what's left?

15:26.300 --> 15:29.595
IV doxorubicin and ifosfamide
might slow the growth,

15:29.678 --> 15:30.846
give him a few more months.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.599
I'm not sending my patient home
with just a few extra months.

15:33.682 --> 15:34.767
It's better than nothing.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.352
What about a transplant?

15:36.435 --> 15:37.436
Not an option.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.146
Heart tumors are a contraindication.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.732
What if we transplant his own heart?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.068
If we take it totally out of his chest,

15:44.151 --> 15:45.945
we'd have access to the posterior heart.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.197
We could excise the tumor,
fix the defect it left,

15:48.280 --> 15:49.823
-and then put it back in.
-Cool.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.033
[Claire] Mm. Not cool.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.826
At least with a normal heart transplant,

15:52.910 --> 15:54.495
you'd be getting a healthy heart.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.872
Her idea keeps the risk
of removing the heart,

15:56.956 --> 15:59.500
and adds the risk
that the heart we'd be putting back in

15:59.583 --> 16:01.126
has just been severely compromised

16:01.210 --> 16:02.628
having had a tumor cut out of it.

16:02.711 --> 16:06.215
He's young, and the part of his heart
not infiltrated with tumor is strong.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.805
Do a cardiac MRA and see if the tumor's
infiltrated the coronary arteries.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.057
If it hasn't, Morgan's idea could work.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.225
I'll schedule it.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.689
[Dr. Andrews] Dr. Murphy is dividing
the breast parenchyma

16:21.772 --> 16:22.982
into three pedicles.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.776
Anyone know where this technique
is derived from?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.444
Breast reduction surgery.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.904
That's right.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.574
And why would I use
a breast reduction technique

16:32.658 --> 16:34.410
to make the patient's breasts larger?

16:34.868 --> 16:36.537
The technique frees up the tissue.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.039
You can bring the pedicles together

16:39.123 --> 16:40.791
to make the breasts smaller

16:40.874 --> 16:43.502
or spread them out
over an implant to make them larger.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.838
[Dr. Andrews] Very good.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.632
And now I'm going to turn the sound off.

16:48.716 --> 16:49.925
Don't worry. Nothing's wrong.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.012
I just wanna talk about you
behind your backs for a little bit.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.932
So, first impressions.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.142
Murphy?

16:58.225 --> 17:00.060
I like Dr. John Lundberg.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.813
[Dr. Andrews] I haven't even
heard him speak yet.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.982
He has the highest U.S.M.L.E. scores.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.483
And that's important to you?

17:07.234 --> 17:08.318
[softly] Yes.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.864
It shows he has
a broad knowledge of medicine.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.950
What is important to you?

17:15.034 --> 17:18.370
Well, I'm more interested
in what they can do with their knowledge,

17:18.454 --> 17:21.206
which is why, so far,
I'm most impressed with Jordan Allen.

17:21.749 --> 17:25.586
No. No, you said she undermined you.

17:25.669 --> 17:29.465
Which takes courage and an assertiveness
that will serve her well.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.093
Then why did you tell her
to stop lecturing you?

17:33.510 --> 17:35.888
It's easier to teach
an aggressive resident restraint

17:35.971 --> 17:38.057
than a passive one
to assert themselves.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.141
[Shaun] Oh.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.020
What about you, Park?
What's important to you?

17:43.103 --> 17:46.106
I wanna know who I can
stand to be around for 80 hours a week.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.524
One thing I learned as a cop,

17:47.608 --> 17:48.942
you don't really know a person

17:49.026 --> 17:51.153
until you've had a few drinks with them.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.242
[machine whirring]

17:57.326 --> 17:59.286
[Dr. Reznick] LAD and circumflex
look clean.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.121
[Claire] What's with the right coronary?

18:01.455 --> 18:03.582
It looks narrowed at the origin.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.335
It's a bit narrow,
but looks like a normal variant.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.795
Yeah, but it seems hazy,

18:07.878 --> 18:10.714
like there could be
some tumor infiltration.

18:11.965 --> 18:12.966
What do you guys think?

18:13.467 --> 18:14.760
-Us?
-Yeah.

18:14.843 --> 18:15.928
Come take
a look.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.057
I guess…

18:20.140 --> 18:21.725
-It's angiogenesis of the left…
-Stop.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.436
Interrupting a female coworker

18:24.520 --> 18:26.438
is almost as annoying as mansplaining.

18:26.772 --> 18:27.940
This isn't a rowing race.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.900
You don't always have to speak first.

18:31.318 --> 18:35.197
I… do not love the interruption.

18:36.907 --> 18:37.908
But…

18:38.534 --> 18:39.952
I like the enthusiasm.

18:41.745 --> 18:42.788
What were you gonna say?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.375
First, um, I'm not sexist.

18:48.127 --> 18:48.961
Of course not.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.922
He's shifting from right to left
dominant circulation

18:52.005 --> 18:53.423
to feed blood to the tumor.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.633
-Angiogenesis.
-I doubt it.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.344
Surgery showed his tumor
extending to the right side, as well.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.679
What were you gonna say?

18:59.304 --> 19:01.306
The pulmonary artery is
right behind that vessel.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.270
It's causing radiographic scatter
in this area.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.855
The haze is just an artifact.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.648
His arteries are clean.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.359
I think she's right.

19:12.901 --> 19:13.777
Hmm.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.698
Your idea might just work.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.372
[Dr. Andrews] If you invert the sutures
and bury them under the skin,

19:25.455 --> 19:26.874
the scar will be invisible.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.084
No one will ever know we were here.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.671
Nice work, both of you.

[beeping slows]

19:58.030 --> 20:00.490
Sinus rhythm. Her BP is stabilizing.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.742
[monitor beeping regularly]

20:03.327 --> 20:06.997
Get her to the ICU.
I want post-op labs, CTA chest,

20:07.080 --> 20:08.790
and full 24-hour cardiac telemetry.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.919
We need to figure out
what just happened.

20:15.881 --> 20:16.882
[monitor beeping]

20:19.343 --> 20:20.427
She's stable,

20:21.053 --> 20:22.721
but diffuse delta wave slowing.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.014
Minimal brain activity.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.184
An undiagnosed metabolic disorder
could've caused

20:27.267 --> 20:28.936
an adverse reaction to the anesthesia.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.146
Yeah, but her pre-op labs
were all normal.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.440
It's gotta be
some sort of hidden heart condition.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.735
You're big on opinions.
How are you with ideas?

20:36.818 --> 20:38.028
What would you do next?

20:40.113 --> 20:41.573
I'd check train of fours

20:41.657 --> 20:44.534
and reverse the paralytics
with neostigmine.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.787
If Dr. Murphy's right,
she should wake up.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.456
Smart. But risky.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.124
The meds will stress her heart.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.210
If Park's right, she could arrest again.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.339
I saw a similar case last year. In Borneo.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.466
You interned at a hospital in Borneo?

20:59.549 --> 21:03.387
Uh, no. I, uh, volunteered
at an orangutan rescue foundation.

21:04.179 --> 21:07.557
Our guide, a local villager,
fell out of a tree.

21:07.641 --> 21:08.642
He was, like, 80 feet up.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.812
How is falling out of a tree
similar to a patient arresting

21:11.895 --> 21:14.273
during breast reconstruction surgery?

21:14.356 --> 21:15.482
Well, he broke his back,

21:15.565 --> 21:17.234
uh, but when we got him
to the hospital,

21:17.317 --> 21:19.611
I found he also had heart damage
from rheumatic fever

21:19.695 --> 21:22.531
and metabolic abnormality
from iodine deficiency.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.992
It's rare here, but it's common there.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.536
We only realized it
when we ran a nuclear profusion scan

21:27.619 --> 21:28.620
of his entire body.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.289
Good catch.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.667
But a scan that extensive
requires multiple radioactive tracers.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.961
You think her heart could handle that?

21:36.044 --> 21:37.129
Not tonight.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.214
I'll get consent from the mom.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.758
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.885
Once we confirm atrial closure,

21:43.969 --> 21:45.679
we'll put the heart back in.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.556
Dr. Lim will reconnect the aorta

21:47.639 --> 21:49.433
and the superior venous connections,

21:49.516 --> 21:51.101
while I connect the inferior.

21:51.184 --> 21:54.396
During my sub-internship,
I assisted on multiple heart transplants.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.024
Even sutured the atrial cuff in one.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.235
I got to scrub in
on a liver transplant once.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.154
The… The patient died.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.071
What'd you learn?

22:04.239 --> 22:06.908
That bile duct leaks
are a lot harder to detect than bleeds.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.410
Good. Next time, I'd lead with that

22:08.493 --> 22:10.078
instead of the patient's death.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.250
Are you all done yet?

22:15.334 --> 22:16.209
Why?

22:16.543 --> 22:19.755
Dr. Park wants everyone
to join him in the break room.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.508
[upbeat music playing on stereo]

22:26.595 --> 22:27.679
I'm Alex Park.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.224
I'm a former amateur
martial arts competitor

22:31.308 --> 22:33.727
who once thought
it'd be fun to spar with a pro boxer

22:33.810 --> 22:35.353
visiting my dad's gym.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.023
And that guy was, uh, Mike Tyson.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.778
Who's Mike Tyson?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.363
He's a guy from <i>The Hangover.</i>

22:45.447 --> 22:47.574
With the tiger and the tattoo on his face.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.286
Nice. You've just revealed
you're crazy and old.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.876
I've seen the musical <i>Wicked</i>
over 50 times.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.712
The San Francisco tryout,
Broadway, Chicago.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.590
I've even seen a friend's boyfriend's
niece play Glinda

23:03.673 --> 23:04.925
at Stagedoor summer camp.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.469
Nerd. Next.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.266
[clears throat] I'm Claire Browne.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.520
Um, I love music,

23:16.603 --> 23:19.439
but I hate musicals, and, um, I don't…

23:19.981 --> 23:23.193
I don't really like to talk about myself,
so it's Shaun's turn.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.119
My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.954
I used to not like music,

23:34.037 --> 23:37.040
but my girlfriend, Lea,
she changed my mind.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.794
I also like to watch
The Weather Channel on TV.

23:41.837 --> 23:42.838
And…

23:42.921 --> 23:43.964
[shudders]

23:44.881 --> 23:46.842
I think pickles are disgusting.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.552
[laughter]

23:50.011 --> 23:52.889
Cops know how to manage up.
Managing down's another story.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.559
Well, he's mature, thoughtful,

23:55.642 --> 23:56.852
doesn't have an ego.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.728
Neither does Murphy,

23:58.812 --> 24:01.815
but do you think that qualifies him
to supervise First Years?

24:02.315 --> 24:03.525
Well, Murphy's smart,

24:03.984 --> 24:06.444
brutally honest,
has no regard for social convention.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.737
[chuckles] Mm.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.156
It works for Bill Belichick.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.951
The Patriots are the most corrupt,
dishonest organization

24:13.034 --> 24:14.202
in the history of the NFL.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.413
Well, the Seahawks suck.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.749
So, how's your experience been here?

24:20.667 --> 24:22.085
It's been good.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.591
Did you consider any other programs

24:27.674 --> 24:29.301
or was this your first choice?

24:29.676 --> 24:31.469
This was my only choice.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.181
Why do you hate God?

24:35.473 --> 24:37.100
Oh. Uh, actually,

24:37.767 --> 24:39.686
I don't believe there is a God.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.814
I thought maybe it was because

24:42.898 --> 24:44.733
you believed he hated homosexuals.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.235
-[chuckles]
-I… I don't think this is something

24:47.319 --> 24:49.237
that we should be discussing at work.

24:51.781 --> 24:52.991
Why not?

24:55.202 --> 24:57.829
Well, because it's personal.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.709
Do you have a boyfriend?

25:02.792 --> 25:06.046
I… I'm sorry, but you can't ask
that question in a workplace.

25:06.129 --> 25:09.591
Dr. Park, he wants us to get to know you.

25:09.674 --> 25:13.178
How can I do that
without asking personal questions?

25:13.720 --> 25:17.098
I have a girlfriend,
and she is very important to me.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.100
It affects my life in every way.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.519
Probably should've thought of that

25:21.603 --> 25:24.105
before you told her
how much her voice annoyed you.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.859
I said it didn't bother me.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.986
It… It was a compliment.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.656
What I heard is you criticizing her voice,

25:33.073 --> 25:34.908
and you bringing her mother into it.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.203
You're in trouble.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.543
What about Browne?

25:46.378 --> 25:48.880
She may have as much problem
being a leader as Murphy,

25:48.964 --> 25:50.173
and without his gifts.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.841
She has her own gifts.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.719
Yeah, dealing with patients
and their families.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.139
But with her colleagues,
she can be insecure.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.642
Her assertiveness has always
been a question mark for me.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.811
They've all got areas that need improving,

26:02.894 --> 26:06.106
but I've gotten to know Browne
a bit better these past few months.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.566
She's stronger than she looks.

26:09.943 --> 26:13.154
When's the last time you saw anyone
digging a ditch in a suit and tie?

26:13.238 --> 26:15.031
Surgeons don't dig ditches.

26:15.115 --> 26:18.076
They help people
at the most vulnerable time in their life.

26:18.618 --> 26:21.454
And you shouldn't take
the responsibility on

26:21.538 --> 26:23.373
if you're not fully committed to it.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.084
You're entering
a new phase in your career,

26:26.167 --> 26:27.377
position of authority.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.713
Maybe my clothes
are making you feel disrespected.

26:29.796 --> 26:30.672
No.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.048
The truth is,

26:32.507 --> 26:34.926
I just hate wearing anything
that makes me feel like

26:35.969 --> 26:36.803
a suit.

26:38.471 --> 26:39.681
[Dr. Reznick] Great news.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.225
I was able to get Sowinski
on anesthesia for tomorrow.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.852
Uh, why? What happened to Foley?

26:43.935 --> 26:45.687
Nothing, I just think Sowinski's better.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.647
And we definitely need
the A-team on this.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.065
Yeah, I… I agree.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.193
Which is why I went
out of my way to get Foley.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.612
But Foley doesn't do well under pressure.

26:54.696 --> 26:55.905
-Remember that time…
-Morgan.

26:56.531 --> 26:59.492
You need to butt out. You're not
a surgeon. This is not your job.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.955
My job is to help my patient
through the entire treatment process.

27:04.039 --> 27:07.083
The best anesthesiologist
for transplant surgery is Sowinski.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.045
And I've already cleared it with Lim,
so that's who it's gonna be.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.254
Deal with it.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.009
[door opens, closes]

27:21.264 --> 27:22.891
Are you mad at me?

27:26.519 --> 27:29.606
I said your voice doesn't bother me.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.150
It was a compliment.

27:32.817 --> 27:36.154
Actually, what you said
is that you love my breasts so much

27:36.237 --> 27:39.324
that with the help of
noise-canceling headphones,

27:39.407 --> 27:41.659
you're willing to put up
with my annoying voice.

27:42.869 --> 27:43.870
Yes.

27:44.913 --> 27:45.914
Not a compliment.

27:47.374 --> 27:48.375
Oh.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.377
So you are mad at me?

27:50.460 --> 27:51.878
I'm not mad, Shaun. I'm just busy,

27:51.961 --> 27:55.006
trying to keep, like, a billion bots
and hackers out of our network.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.508
[mouse clicking]

27:57.050 --> 27:58.468
Actually, no. I'm not doing that.

27:58.551 --> 27:59.552
Gonna go home.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.430
You want to have some tequila, stat?

28:02.847 --> 28:04.766
We also have some pizza left.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.227
No, I don't want tequila or pizza.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.437
-[laptop slams shut]
-That must mean you're mad.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.731
I'm just… upset.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.192
And confused.

28:14.275 --> 28:17.153
And I really don't think
there is anything you can do about it,

28:17.237 --> 28:20.657
so you just need to stop trying
and leave me alone.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.876
[Shaun] She's not mad at me.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.586
[Jordan] She's definitely mad at you.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.297
She doesn't usually
hide what she thinks.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.007
[Enrique] She's not mad at him.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.886
She knows how he is, how he talks.

28:42.303 --> 28:44.222
She's mad at herself. And scared.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.475
We all have stuff
that we're insecure about.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.853
That's why it's so risky falling in love.

28:52.313 --> 28:54.107
We all hope that
when we let our guard down,

28:54.190 --> 28:56.401
it's for the one person
that doesn't see our flaws.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.199
So, what do I do?

29:04.367 --> 29:06.786
You were being honest.
You can't apologize that away.

29:07.704 --> 29:11.082
You gotta figure out what she needs
to feel secure in the relationship again.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.712
Don't look at me. I'm single.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.678
It's not my place
to comment on your personal life.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.764
You have an opinion. Let's hear it.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.432
Fine.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.935
Can you zoom in on her skull base?

29:31.019 --> 29:32.228
[Dr. Park] I can, but why?

29:32.312 --> 29:35.106
We're worried about her heart
and metabolic abnormalities.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.859
We shouldn't be. Not anymore.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.070
You and Dr. Murphy were both wrong.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.573
She doesn't have
a cardiac or metabolic issue.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.993
She has poor blood flow
in the artery supplying blood

29:47.076 --> 29:49.454
to the area of her brain
that controls consciousness.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.998
A small clot in her artery of Percheron.

29:52.081 --> 29:55.919
If we don't remove it fast,
she's never going to wake up.

29:56.002 --> 29:57.003
[monitor beeping]

30:07.555 --> 30:09.057
[softly] That's amazing.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.350
No, it's not.

30:11.059 --> 30:14.354
The heart's totally outside of the body
and still beating.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.189
It's like it has a mind of its own.

30:16.272 --> 30:18.399
She should've started
the reimplantation by now.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.527
Is everything okay, Dr. Lim?

30:20.610 --> 30:23.363
[Dr. Lim] The tumor had tendrils
invading the right atrial wall.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.615
We took so much tissue
to get a clear margin,

30:25.698 --> 30:28.785
there's not enough left to reconstruct
his heart's inflow chambers.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.119
How about expanded PTFE graft?

30:30.203 --> 30:32.455
There's not enough atrial remnant
to attach the graft.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.375
-Use the septal wall.
-He's got dense conduction fibers there.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.585
-It could cause heart arrhythmias.
-Not if you use…

30:37.669 --> 30:39.754
-[rapid beeping]
-He's got low arterial pressure.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.714
He's springing leaks
at the cannulation sites.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.967
It's a bleeding disorder
caused by prolonged bypass.

30:44.050 --> 30:45.677
You need to get his heart back in ASAP.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.972
Morgan, we can't put the heart back in
with two missing chambers.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.647
[Dr. Andrews distorted]
It's a rare complication,

30:57.730 --> 30:59.649
but a blood clot is a risk in any surgery.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.110
[Dr. Park] It's too deep in the brain
for open surgery.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.570
If we go rooting around in there,

31:03.653 --> 31:05.822
we'd definitely damage
the PCA and kill her.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.908
We could inject
a dissolving agent into the clot.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.871
There's a 50% probability
it won't fully dissolve,

31:12.954 --> 31:16.332
which could leave her with permanent
weakness and cognitive difficulties.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.418
[Jordan] Assuming she wakes up at all.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.925
We need to remove the clot
with a stent retriever.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.263
If we rupture
the posterior cerebral artery,

31:30.346 --> 31:31.848
she'll die on the table.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.894
Or total recovery.

31:37.353 --> 31:39.314
That's how she came into this hospital.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.024
That's how she's leaving.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.570
Prep her for stent retrieval.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.572
[monitor beeping]

31:47.655 --> 31:50.408
I'm hanging platelets
and fresh frozen plasma.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.243
His pressure is still in the toilet,

31:52.327 --> 31:53.953
but the bleeding is slowing down.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.246
Not for long.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.624
Small intestine submucosa
has the right compliance

31:57.707 --> 31:59.083
to shape the chamber walls, but…

31:59.167 --> 32:01.044
There isn't enough
to cover that much area.

32:01.127 --> 32:03.463
Use too little
and he'll have heart failure in a month.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.048
I know. That's the "but."

32:05.131 --> 32:06.591
How thick is his deep fascia?

32:06.674 --> 32:09.177
-If it's over 2 millimeters…
-[Dr. Lim] Morgan.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.762
Get out.

32:10.845 --> 32:12.388
I'm sorry. I'll… I'll be quiet.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.598
No, you won't. You can't.

32:13.681 --> 32:14.974
So leave the OR gallery.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.603
Now.

32:24.984 --> 32:28.488
We need 2.6-millimeter-thick tissue
with perfect compliance

32:28.571 --> 32:30.865
for arterial filling
and contractile pressures.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.077
If it was just the valve,
we'd use a bovine pericardial graft.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.956
But cow heart tissue is not durable enough
to do an entire chamber.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.416
But pig bladder tissue is just right.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.836
I've used it for bladder reconstructive
surgeries, but never hearts.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.172
Let's rebuild
the entire atrial walls with it.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.383
Get down to the tissue procurement lab

32:48.466 --> 32:50.969
and get 200 centimeters
of porcine bladder tissue.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.434
[monitor beeping]

33:00.311 --> 33:02.647
Her EEG delta waves
are slowing further.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.566
[Dr. Andrews] She only has one vessel
feeding her thalamus.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.152
That's why the clot landed where it did.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.822
I'm approaching the artery of Percheron.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.449
I'm one millimeter from the clot.

33:13.866 --> 33:14.867
Stop right there.

33:20.498 --> 33:23.918
If we disrupt this clot, we could cause
a shower of emboli into her brain.

33:47.483 --> 33:48.651
Deploying the retriever.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.071
[monitor beeping rapidly]

33:52.655 --> 33:53.906
EEG just went flatline.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.491
Calm down. I'm almost…

33:57.910 --> 33:58.911
Got it.

34:05.251 --> 34:07.336
Blood's flowing through the artery.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.172
Her brain tracing's looking better.

34:09.255 --> 34:10.631
[monitor beeping regularly]

34:15.887 --> 34:19.807
This should fill the gap between
the inferior and superior vena cava

34:19.891 --> 34:21.726
when the new chambers get sewn in.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.269
Where's that graft?

34:23.770 --> 34:26.105
I need more sponges.
The bleeding is getting worse.

34:26.189 --> 34:27.774

-Oh, he's tanking.

34:27.857 --> 34:30.151
-Can you push epi?
-I already did. He's maxing out.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.528
I'm running out of ways
to keep his pressure up.

34:32.612 --> 34:33.696
I got it.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.782
They had 205 centimeters of it.

34:35.865 --> 34:36.866
Thank you.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.328
If you want to gown up,
you can watch from down here.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.746
Definitely. Thanks.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.292
I thought telling her how much I love her

34:46.375 --> 34:48.669
in front of other people
would make her feel good.

34:48.753 --> 34:52.381
But Dr. Guerin said
I made her feel insecure, and scared.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.258
Women are sensitive.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.220
When commenting on their flaws,

34:57.303 --> 34:59.764
total honesty is a high-risk procedure.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.140
That sounds sexist.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.768
Aren't men also insecure
about their flaws?

35:03.851 --> 35:05.228
Men are much, much worse.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.063
And also, we're really stupid.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.147
Okay.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.817
What can I do now?

35:10.900 --> 35:13.402
I've already said my stupid stuff.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.404
I don't want her to be upset with me.

35:17.782 --> 35:18.866
I have a thought.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.496
I think this run of sutures
will hold it to the annulus,

35:23.579 --> 35:24.831
but I'm worried about leaks.

35:24.914 --> 35:28.459
We can put a second row of pledgeted
sutures to make sure it's hemostatic.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.545
That is unreal.

35:31.712 --> 35:32.922
[Dr. Lim] It's a work of art.

35:35.341 --> 35:36.509
Now let's get it back in

35:36.592 --> 35:38.719
while we can
still get him off bypass alive.

[breathes deeply]

36:19.343 --> 36:20.344
Hey.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.556
There was a complication

36:23.639 --> 36:25.474
during the reconstruction surgery.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.353
A clot,
which caused you to lapse into a coma.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.065
We performed
a second surgery on your brain,

36:33.149 --> 36:34.358
which was successful.

36:34.859 --> 36:35.860
Um…

36:35.943 --> 36:37.028
You're gonna be fine.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.321
But my breasts…

36:38.988 --> 36:43.075
The clot occurred
after we finished inserting the implants.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.706
I think you're gonna
be very pleased with the results.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.209
Thank you.

36:51.626 --> 36:52.627
Yep.

36:59.175 --> 37:02.595
I… think I'm sorry.

37:06.682 --> 37:11.103
Dr. Guerin said I should never say
anything that might sound negative

37:11.187 --> 37:12.396
to a girlfriend.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.692
And Dr. Glassman said total honesty
is a high-risk procedure

37:17.610 --> 37:18.653
with a girlfriend.

37:18.736 --> 37:22.156
It's better to show my love
than try to explain it.

37:25.076 --> 37:30.289
But I want to be totally honest with you.

37:33.459 --> 37:34.543
[sighs softly]

37:36.712 --> 37:41.133
I don't like your body
because it's excellent.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.302
I like it because it's yours.

37:46.013 --> 37:49.934
And I love hearing you talk.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.519
When I hear your voice,

37:52.353 --> 37:55.398
especially when I've had a difficult day,

37:55.481 --> 37:56.983
I find it comforting.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.615
Now I want to hug you. Can I?

38:05.866 --> 38:06.951
I'd like that.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.046
I love you.

38:20.673 --> 38:21.757
Thank you.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.052
For your total honesty.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.686
[Dr. Reznick] Your surgery went well.

38:33.769 --> 38:36.897
With some time in rehab,
you should be back to work in a month.

38:36.981 --> 38:37.940
Thank you.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.693
Don't thank me. Thank your surgeon.

She did all the important stuff.

38:47.491 --> 38:50.119
Lim's golden boy is in.
Nothing we can do about that.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.038
So that leaves three openings.

38:52.288 --> 38:55.374
The thought of working
with Will Hooper for the next two years…

38:55.458 --> 38:57.585
If Dr. Lim thinks
he'll be a good resident,

38:57.668 --> 38:59.628
I'm sure she has good reasons.

38:59.712 --> 39:03.341
She probably thinks
arrogance is helpful to a surgeon.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.092
Well, we could try
to change her mind.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.553
Eh, she asked us
to evaluate the applicants, not her.

39:07.636 --> 39:10.473
She asked us to be totally honest.

39:10.556 --> 39:12.767
Eh, "totally honest" is a relative term

39:12.850 --> 39:15.061
when you're telling your boss
she's totally wrong.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.775
So, Hooper's in. Who else?

39:20.858 --> 39:24.320
Dr. Andrews likes Dr. Jordan Allen.

39:24.403 --> 39:26.697
Oh, I do, too. She's confident, driven.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.657
She won't take a lot of hand-holding,

39:28.741 --> 39:30.993
and keeping Andrews happy
keeps us happy.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.746
That leaves two more. Who's next?

39:34.705 --> 39:38.793
Asher Wolke is very up-front
about who he is.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.087
-I like that.
-He's definitely eager.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.464
And he couldn't be
more open to learning.

39:43.547 --> 39:44.548
Agree.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.716
That leaves one more.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.594
[both] John Lundberg.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.722
Smart, professional, mature.

39:51.806 --> 39:52.890
He's a no-brainer.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.059
Lundberg's in.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.227
Lundberg's out.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.771
He stopped by my office before he left.

39:58.854 --> 40:00.856
Said he's no longer interested.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.902
He said you all were unprofessional.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.238

40:08.030 --> 40:09.949
Asking inappropriate questions.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.078
Mm-hmm.

40:14.995 --> 40:18.207
So, who's your alt?
Olivia Jackson or Boardshorts?

40:19.708 --> 40:22.545
Olivia knows her stuff,
but she's a bit insecure.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.881
Her answers sound like questions.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.634
I like Boardshorts. He's sensitive.

40:28.717 --> 40:29.802
Like a woman.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.268
I vote for both of them.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.521
That's not an option.
We don't have the budget.

40:41.522 --> 40:42.523
[sighs]

40:42.898 --> 40:43.899
Hooper is the worst.

40:45.359 --> 40:46.944
The person I said was the best?

40:47.486 --> 40:50.322
He is arrogant and obnoxious.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.575
If he works here, we'll hate him,

40:52.658 --> 40:56.162
the work will suffer,
and we'll either kill patients

40:56.245 --> 40:57.538
or we'll kill him.

41:03.878 --> 41:07.298
And there is no way that you don't
see that, which makes me think…

41:10.301 --> 41:11.302
You do.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.554
This was a test.

41:14.805 --> 41:18.642
You just wanted to see
if we'd be totally honest.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.480
-Well done.
-[chuckles]

41:22.855 --> 41:25.316
Hooper is definitely the worst.

41:25.399 --> 41:27.902
I only let him shadow
as a favor to a board member.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.405
I figured I'd give him a second chance
after his obnoxious interview.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.741
And also do a little experiment.

41:34.366 --> 41:35.367
[laughs]

41:36.869 --> 41:37.870
So…

41:38.746 --> 41:43.083
It's Jordan, Asher,

41:43.167 --> 41:45.586
Olivia, and Enrique.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.758
To the next phase
of your surgical training.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.384
You helped pick them.

41:52.468 --> 41:55.346
As senior residents,
it's now your job to help train them.

41:55.554 --> 41:57.806
And don't take this
responsibility lightly,

41:57.890 --> 41:59.767
because if you don't train them well,

42:00.100 --> 42:01.185
people will die.
