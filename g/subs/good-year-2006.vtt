No.

it only appropriate that we open
something extra special.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.236

- Excellent choice.

01:53.197 --> 01:56.824
Tempier Bandol, 1969.

01:56.992 --> 02:00.369
The kind of wine that'll pickle
even the toughest of men.

02:00.871 --> 02:04.957
I once saw a Castilian prizefighter

02:21.225 --> 02:22.475
Quite right.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.686
A blue suit is the most versatile

You don't make the wine,

In France it's always the landowner
who makes the wine,

03:04.643 --> 03:08.187

than supervise with binoculars

03:08.355 --> 03:10.273
from the comfort of his study.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.941
No, I enjoy making wine

03:12.109 --> 03:17.446
because this sublime nectar is,
quite simply, incapable of lying.

it matters not.
