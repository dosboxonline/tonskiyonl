01:53.197 --> 01:56.824
Tempier Bandol, 1969.

The kind of wine that'll pickle

I once saw a Castilian prizefighter

Quite right.

A blue suit is the most versatile

You don't make the wine,

who makes the wine,

03:10.440 --> 03:11.941
No, I enjoy making wine

03:12.109 --> 03:17.446

quite simply, incapable of lying.
