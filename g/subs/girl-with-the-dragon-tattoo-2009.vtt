02:11.840 --> 02:16.343
THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO

02:16.678 --> 02:19.680
BASED ON STIEG LARSSON'S NOVEL

02:58.094 --> 03:02.097
Today the verdict was delivered
in the Wennerström case.

03:02.307 --> 03:07.811
The publisher of Millennium
Magazine, Mikael Blomkvist, -

03:07.854 --> 03:10.564
- has been accused of libel -

03:10.773 --> 03:14.776
- by successful businessman
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

03:14.861 --> 03:19.907
Blomkvist had accused Wennerström of
gun-running and other serious felonies -

03:20.116 --> 03:22.868
- amounting to over 60 million kroner.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.914
The Swedes have never agreed
on Mikael Blomkvist.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.918
His supporters claim
he's the last bastion -

03:31.127 --> 03:33.837
- of a journalism with ideals.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.381
But Blomkvist's long career -

03:36.591 --> 03:39.343
- as a watchdog may now be over.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.891
In the case of
Wennerström versus Millennium, -

03:45.975 --> 03:51.897
- the accused Mikael Blomkvist is
found guilty on 6 out of 8 counts.

03:52.357 --> 03:56.276
The accused is sentenced to
three months in jail -

03:56.444 --> 04:01.907
- and will pay damages of 150,000
kroner to Hans-Erik Wennerström.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.792
You have to stop people
like Kalle Blomkvist -

04:11.918 --> 04:18.382
- who sniff around in other people's
business due to political differences.

04:19.216 --> 04:22.302
- How will you celebrate?
- No comment.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.929
There he is.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.225
- What's it like to be found guilty?
- Wonderful.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.396
Can you continue
your work as a reporter?

04:34.399 --> 04:38.318
- Cheers, everybody. Merry Christmas.
- Cheers. Merry Christmas.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.488
- Cheers.
- How do we appeal the verdict?

04:41.990 --> 04:45.784
We support you
one hundred per cent, Micke.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.996
But we have to do something.
Our advertisers are losing trust.

04:49.163 --> 04:54.251
- We won't win it back by appealing.
- But it'll buy us some time.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.879
- No appeal. It's over.
- Millennium's future is at stake.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.925
The faster this ends,
the better for Millennium.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.429
I don't want
to play devil's advocate, -

05:05.638 --> 05:10.183
- but it might be a good idea
if Mikael took leave from Millennium.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.436
Till this thing's blown over.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.986
Merry Christmas.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.118
Wait, Micke.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.622
- They're in shock.
- Only Janne dares to speak the truth.

05:32.832 --> 05:37.044
- I was set up. I'm a problem.
- We just have to find a way.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.004
It's empty in here.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.550
I haven't written a single word
for months now.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.222
Do you understand?

06:36.479 --> 06:40.065
WENNERSTRÖM
KNOCKS OUT BLOMKVIST

06:47.323 --> 06:49.574
GOING TO PRISON

06:56.541 --> 06:58.458
Damn.

07:21.107 --> 07:25.360
We don't normally introduce
the researchers to our clients.

07:25.570 --> 07:29.948
But your client is special to us,
so we'll make an exception.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.076
- It's much appreciated.
- But I must warn you.

07:33.119 --> 07:38.915
- Lisbeth is a pretty odd girl.
- What do you mean by odd?

07:39.083 --> 07:42.836
Make no mistake.
She's the best researcher we have.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.005
Good morning, Lisbeth.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.179
Good morning.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.056
Dirch Frode.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.416
Transcripts of text messages.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.628
E-mails. Bank statements.

08:25.963 --> 08:29.007
How did you get access
to all this?

08:29.175 --> 08:32.177
You order the goods.
I deliver them.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.100
What can you tell me
about Blomkvist?

08:39.184 --> 08:43.270
- It's all in my report.
- The short version.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.109
Blomkvist was nicknamed after fictional
boy detective Kalle Blomkvist -

08:48.194 --> 08:50.862
- when he foiled
a bank robbery in the eighties.

08:51.072 --> 08:55.575
He's a public figure without any big
secrets. Read all the news clippings.

08:56.702 --> 09:01.331
- But he does have secrets?
- Everyone has secrets.

09:01.582 --> 09:06.211
To what extent is he affected by
the crisis at Millennium?

09:06.420 --> 09:10.215
- Financially, I mean.
- Why don't you just read the report?

09:10.341 --> 09:14.177
Miss Salander,
is there anything you'd like to add?

09:14.220 --> 09:17.472
What's your personal take on him?

09:19.267 --> 09:22.352
There's something fishy
about the Wennerström case.

09:22.603 --> 09:26.690
What do you mean?
There's more to the case?

09:26.899 --> 09:29.776
I'm researching Blomkvist,
not doing his job.

09:30.027 --> 09:34.322
I'd just like to hear
your personal opinion.

09:34.532 --> 09:38.952
Blomkvist's totally clean.
I didn't find anything on him.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.914
I don't think he faked any evidence
against Wennerström.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.083
I think he was set up.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.546
Why didn't you ask me?

09:49.755 --> 09:54.301
- No lawyer could save me.
- I know. I read the verdict.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.387
I didn't want to involve you.

09:57.638 --> 10:01.975
But you could've asked me.
I'm your sister.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.477
- I know.
- I'm glad.

10:04.687 --> 10:08.273
I'm already in the gutter.
Why drag the family down with me?

10:08.399 --> 10:11.568
And you're going to prison.
It's insane.

10:11.777 --> 10:18.241
The secret to good meatballs
is to wet your fingers.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.911
When you roll them,
rub your hands together.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.497
Shit. Will you answer it, please?

10:28.169 --> 10:32.130
- Hello, this is Micke Blomkvist.
- You little rascal.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.300
- This is Mikael.
- Mikael Blomkvist?

10:35.509 --> 10:40.138
- Yes. Who's this?
- My name's Dirch Frode.

10:40.306 --> 10:44.100
I'm a lawyer and I have
a client who'd like to see you.

10:44.268 --> 10:48.313
- It's Christmas. What is it about?
- My client will tell you himself.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.316
Call Millennium after New Year's Eve.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.319
My client doesn't like waiting.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.280
- Who's your client?
- Henrik Vanger.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.866
From the Vanger Group?

11:00.117 --> 11:03.453
My client would be very grateful
if you'd come.

11:03.704 --> 11:07.165
Listen, it's Christmas,
and it's been a hell of a week.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.794
I promise
you'll find it interesting.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.068
Blomkvist!

11:42.076 --> 11:47.372
Henrik lives on the island of Hedeby,
a mile or two from Hedestad.

11:55.881 --> 11:59.884
The bridge is the only link
to the mainland.

12:11.689 --> 12:17.068
In the old days, the Swedish
business elite came here.

12:17.278 --> 12:21.030
Now it's just Henrik and his
housekeeper Anna who live here.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.623
Thank you for coming, Mikael.

12:32.251 --> 12:35.628
Frode's call was pretty unusual.

12:37.214 --> 12:41.426
- Are you hungry? It's lunchtime.
- No thanks. Let's get started.

12:41.510 --> 12:45.430
- I'm going back again today.
- Right. No lunch then.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.522
Do you remember her?

12:56.984 --> 13:01.196
It's Harriet Vanger,
my brother Gottfried's daughter.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.407
You've met her.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.327
This girl?

13:08.496 --> 13:13.500
Your father worked for me
during the summer of 1965.

13:13.667 --> 13:18.379
He was a mechanical engineer at
the plant and lived in a cottage here.

13:19.590 --> 13:23.092
You and your mother
came for visits -

13:23.135 --> 13:25.220
- during the weekends.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.181
Harriet looked after you.

13:28.390 --> 13:32.143
You often played
down there by the water.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.149
I remember her.

13:40.152 --> 13:44.155
- Harriet.
- I never had any children of my own.

13:45.157 --> 13:49.244
Harriet was the apple of my eye.
An incredibly smart girl.

13:49.453 --> 13:52.789
She was like a daughter to me.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.669
What happened to her?

14:00.214 --> 14:04.259
- I believe she was killed.
- Killed?

14:09.640 --> 14:15.019
This is the Vanger family, Mikael.
My family.

14:16.230 --> 14:22.026
September 22nd, 1966. On that day
the family gathered in this house -

14:22.194 --> 14:25.071
- for the yearly board meeting.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.826
30 small-minded
and greedy people -

14:30.619 --> 14:34.205
- fighting for
the biggest slice of the cake.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.417
One of these people...

14:40.170 --> 14:41.921
...killed Harriet.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.219
Harriet was 16 years old.
It was Children's Day.

14:49.138 --> 14:53.892
She'd been to Hedestad to
watch the parade in the main street.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.228
This picture
was in the local paper.

14:58.188 --> 15:01.274
She returned to the island
around two o'clock.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.236
She wanted to see me, but...

15:05.279 --> 15:08.156
...I was too busy
with the meeting.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.951
How was she killed?

15:13.913 --> 15:18.291
Nobody knows.
She just disappeared.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.046
You're well prepared.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.467
I've been thinking about
that day for 40 years.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.179
That's what I call preparation.

15:32.181 --> 15:38.686
Quarter after two there was a serious
road accident on the bridge.

15:38.896 --> 15:44.275
A fuel tanker full of gas
crashed into a car.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.195
The tanker
was blocking the bridge.

15:47.279 --> 15:51.366
It spilled gasoline
all over the place.

15:51.575 --> 15:56.329
Nobody could pass the tanker.
Everyone had to stay on the island.

15:56.538 --> 16:00.208
By chance,
a photographer caught this.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.336
Look at the window.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.800
This is the last picture
taken of Harriet.

16:10.302 --> 16:15.390
Officer Morell from Hedestad Police
was in charge of the investigation.

16:15.599 --> 16:21.270
He found this film
and had the photo blown up.

16:21.313 --> 16:25.149
Since then nobody has seen her.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.989
We waited for her at dinner,
but she never turned up.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.286
- Hello?
- Lisbeth Salander?

16:37.329 --> 16:40.623
- Who's this?
- It's the probation department.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.460
I'm calling to tell you
you've got a new guardian.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.337
I already have one.

16:46.547 --> 16:51.217
Your current guardian
has had a stroke -

16:51.343 --> 16:54.345
- so I've had to find you
a new one.

16:55.723 --> 16:59.809
I'm glad we could meet
even though it's Christmas.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.606
It's a little unfortunate -

17:05.816 --> 17:11.279
- that Palmgren had such a relaxed
attitude towards guardianship laws.

17:11.363 --> 17:15.407
I see you were allowed
to control your own finances.

17:15.617 --> 17:20.371
- There haven't been any problems.
- No, maybe not.

17:20.414 --> 17:25.376
But as your guardian, I'm legally
and financially responsible.

17:25.419 --> 17:31.424
So I'm to blame if you suddenly
can't come up with your rent.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.844
I work.
I earn my own money.

17:37.389 --> 17:42.393
Yes, I can see you work for
Milton Security...

17:43.437 --> 17:47.398
- What do you do?
- I make coffee and photocopies.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.071
This is what we'll do:

17:53.280 --> 17:57.408
From now on your pay will be deposited
into a new account that I administer.

17:58.410 --> 18:02.538
Each month you'll get a small amount
for personal necessities, -

18:02.790 --> 18:07.543
- but all other expenses have to be
approved by me. Okay?

18:13.425 --> 18:17.470
How do you look after
your personal hygiene?

18:17.971 --> 18:19.347
What do you mean?

18:20.349 --> 18:24.477
With all those rings.
Don't you get infections?

18:28.732 --> 18:30.733
Do you have a boyfriend?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.528
No.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.572
Have you ever had sex?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.450
I'm 24.

18:40.410 --> 18:45.456
I can either write down
that you are cooperating, -

18:45.541 --> 18:49.335
- or that you are causing problems
and being difficult.

18:50.420 --> 18:54.132
And then your life'll get harder
very quickly.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.928
So how many people
have you had sex with?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.474
- Two.
- Two?

19:05.978 --> 19:08.604
200.
No. 2,000.

19:08.856 --> 19:13.484
- 200,000. Are we done now?
- What kind of sex do you have?

19:14.945 --> 19:17.488
Any special preferences?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.912
What if she simply ran off?

19:25.122 --> 19:29.500
You have to keep the accident in mind.
The bridge was closed for 24 hours.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.378
That's the only way off the island.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.798
So Harriet disappeared
when nobody could leave.

19:36.008 --> 19:41.179
It was only the next day we started
thinking there might be a crime.

19:41.388 --> 19:46.559
But then the bridge was open and the
killer could've disposed of the body.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.645
She could have drowned,
killed herself.

19:49.897 --> 19:55.318
We dragged for her body. We had
tracker dogs and divers everywhere.

19:55.777 --> 19:58.529
Even today,
when I go for a walk, -

19:58.572 --> 20:01.532
- I catch myself looking for her.

20:04.161 --> 20:08.831
When Harriet was eight,
she gave me a birthday present.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.543
A framed bluebell
from 1958.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.546
After that she gave me
a new flower each year.

20:16.965 --> 20:20.551
1966.
The year Harriet disappeared.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.514
We're going to the attic.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.033
Amazing.

20:44.243 --> 20:48.829
Every damn year, I receive
a framed flower on my birthday -

20:49.039 --> 20:51.457
- from some far corner
of the world.

20:52.626 --> 20:56.879
- Who do you believe sends them?
- Harriet's killer.

20:58.006 --> 21:02.385
You don't know my family. You don't
know what they're capable of.

21:05.305 --> 21:10.393
Harriet was my favorite. That made her
the ideal victim for those -

21:10.560 --> 21:13.604
- who wanted more power
in the Vanger Group.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.401
They wanted to crush me.

21:19.611 --> 21:23.906
I'm 82 years old.
The police gave up long ago.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.493
I'll end up going to my grave
without knowing.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.621
Help me by giving it one last try.

21:30.747 --> 21:34.000
- Why me?
- I've followed your career.

21:34.167 --> 21:37.044
You're a damn good reporter.
Persistent.

21:37.254 --> 21:41.632
I'm not asking you to solve
the mystery. Just try.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.094
You've six months before
you have to serve your sentence.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.057
You've devoted 40 years to...

21:50.267 --> 21:54.103
I'll pay you handsomely.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.441
You'll be well off.
You've got nothing to lose.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.486
Nothing's waiting for you
in Stockholm.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.749
"Mikael Blomkvist resigns from
Millennium's board -

22:14.958 --> 22:17.668
- and will no longer
work for the magazine."

22:17.711 --> 22:21.672
Did you write this press release
without talking to me?

22:24.343 --> 22:27.595
Only I could make that decision.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.685
What now?

22:35.354 --> 22:38.356
I'll work for Henrik Vanger.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.524
Henrik Vanger?

22:41.693 --> 22:45.363
I see. So now you're working for
the big capitalists?

22:46.698 --> 22:49.533
It's not for the Vanger Group.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.706
You're gonna stay there?

22:57.334 --> 22:59.126
In Hedestad?

23:07.219 --> 23:08.928
Have a nice trip.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.584
Come on, motherfucker!

24:28.800 --> 24:30.885
What are you looking at?

24:34.764 --> 24:37.808
- What the fuck?
- What are you doing, damn bitch?

24:38.894 --> 24:41.770
That bitch is going down.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.696
- Fucking bitch!
- Get her down!

24:58.830 --> 25:02.500
- The bitch is fucking crazy.
- Come again, you cunts!

25:04.044 --> 25:05.961
Come on.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.728
Shit.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.314
What do you think?

25:27.859 --> 25:30.528
- I can save the hard drive.
- Good.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.701
And the rest?

25:41.414 --> 25:43.707
You have to go shopping.

25:46.711 --> 25:50.172
- How did it happen?
- Never mind.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.428
You stink of beer.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.557
You think you smell
like you just took a shower?

26:04.729 --> 26:07.273
You can borrow my old computer.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.609
I'm using it for back-up,
so it has to stay here.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.717
Welcome to Hedeby.

26:34.884 --> 26:38.804
Wonderfully refreshing
with this icy weather.

26:38.930 --> 26:43.809
You didn't want to stay in the main
building. I hope you'll like it here.

26:49.816 --> 26:53.736
If it gets any colder,
the pipes will freeze.

26:53.903 --> 26:57.156
Then you'll have to
come to me for water.

26:57.365 --> 27:01.368
Oh, there you are.
Just leave it there.

27:04.456 --> 27:09.960
It's some of the stuff I've collected
over all these years.

27:10.879 --> 27:15.341
There are photographs.
Police reports.

27:16.343 --> 27:21.972
News articles.
Even some of Harriet's belongings.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.477
Well, it's a start.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.863
You were a beautiful babysitter.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.678
What happened to you?

29:30.393 --> 29:32.936
Keep Sweden pure!

29:33.104 --> 29:36.106
We are the Swedish
National Socialists -

29:36.191 --> 29:41.028
- and the Aryan race
can't do without us!

29:50.622 --> 29:54.249
All in all, the Vangers are a
pretty unpleasant bunch.

29:54.751 --> 29:58.921
Most of us hate each other,
but are forced together by business.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.133
My brother Harald lives in there.

30:04.219 --> 30:07.513
We don't get along, to put it mildly.

30:09.808 --> 30:14.144
Your brothers Richard and Harald
joined a Nazi group in the 30's.

30:15.146 --> 30:18.398
I see...
You already know about that.

30:19.567 --> 30:22.236
Gottfried was a member of
the Hitler Youth.

30:23.446 --> 30:27.032
All three were Nazis.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.037
Yes. And fanatics, at that.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.834
Richard died in the
Finnish Winter War.

30:38.419 --> 30:43.715
Harald has turned into a bitter,
old man. He never leaves the house.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.972
Harald's daughter Cecilia
is currently in Scotland.

30:51.182 --> 30:54.059
Cecilia and Harald
are not on speaking terms.

31:01.442 --> 31:04.486
Martin lives up there.
Harriet's brother.

31:06.072 --> 31:09.074
He took over
the Vanger Group after me.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.910
Hi.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.206
Well, well. If it isn't the
famous Kalle Blomkvist.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.501
Just call me Mikael.
Then I know who you're talking to.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.921
I'm eager to hear why on earth -

31:23.131 --> 31:26.675
- you are to spend six months
in this godforsaken place.

31:29.220 --> 31:32.306
Martin's and Harriet's father,
Gottfried, -

31:32.515 --> 31:36.018
- led a miserable, alcoholic life
with his wife Isabella.

31:37.645 --> 31:42.274
I've never seen a woman be as bad
a mother as Isabella was to Harriet.

31:45.945 --> 31:49.239
I stepped in and took
Harriet and Martin under my wing.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.203
And that's all of the Vangers
who live here.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.248
On that day, even more joined us.

31:58.333 --> 32:02.377
Cecilia's sister Anita
who died from cancer.

32:02.629 --> 32:06.882
- Greger Vanger and Ulrika Vanger.
- Wait a minute.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.967
Who do you suspect?

32:12.096 --> 32:13.472
Nobody.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.643
And everybody. That's where you
come into the picture.

32:55.264 --> 33:00.060
Dear Diary. Today I got this diary
from my dear uncle Henrik.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.646
A kind, but busy, man.

33:02.814 --> 33:07.067
He's finally home from his travels
and brought me this diary.

33:08.319 --> 33:13.490
I'm by myself in my dad's cottage.
Anita will be here soon.

34:12.425 --> 34:15.802
So you're the one
sniffing around in family matters?

34:16.344 --> 34:19.347
Hell, you scared me.

34:20.349 --> 34:24.018
Cecilia Vanger.
Henrik said you'd be here.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.731
- Mikael Blomkvist.
- I recognize you from the papers.

34:28.815 --> 34:31.735
- What have you found?
- Harriet's Bible.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.322
She was often up here
with my sister.

34:36.364 --> 34:38.324
- Anita?
- Yes.

34:38.367 --> 34:41.578
The summer before she disappeared.

34:41.788 --> 34:47.042
- Odd, seeing that her father died here.
- Gottfried died here?

34:48.210 --> 34:52.797
He was drunk and fell into the lake.
They found him the next morning.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.382
Just down there.

34:58.888 --> 35:01.848
It happened the year before
Harriet disappeared.

35:03.017 --> 35:05.102
Henrik said you were traveling.

35:05.311 --> 35:08.814
I had to come home
in order to hide Harriet's body.

35:11.275 --> 35:14.820
We weren't allowed to be here
when we were kids. It was off-limits.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.116
Thanks.

35:21.119 --> 35:26.456
Dear Diary. It's fall now.
The weather's getting colder.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.710
Magda 30112.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.339
Sara 32016.

35:35.049 --> 35:38.218
BJ 32027.

35:39.262 --> 35:42.347
LJ 31208.

35:43.057 --> 35:46.351
Mari 32018.

35:46.435 --> 35:49.729
I don't understand
why Henrik hired you.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.942
To be honest, neither do I.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.863
With all respect,
there's nothing to find.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.157
It's been nearly 40 years.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.451
You found Harriet's diary
in her dad's cottage.

36:03.536 --> 36:08.915
- The diary didn't help us one bit.
- What about the phone numbers?

36:09.125 --> 36:12.919
- They were a complete mystery to us.
- But 32 is...

36:13.129 --> 36:17.007
32 could be Hedestad.
30 is Norrbyn's area code.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.385
But the names
and the numbers don't match.

36:20.469 --> 36:24.472
- Did you call them up?
- We did. We even tried backwards.

36:24.557 --> 36:29.186
We switched them, removed numbers.
We tried everything.

36:29.395 --> 36:34.482
In the report, she's described as
withdrawn and religiously inclined.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.943
Was that your impression?

36:37.153 --> 36:40.947
Who isn't withdrawn at that age?

36:41.157 --> 36:47.162
But, yes. She kept to herself.
Anita, her cousin, knew her the best.

36:47.371 --> 36:51.041
Anita is Cecilia Vanger's sister.
And Anita is dead.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.044
She died many years ago.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.882
Harriet was my first case.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.636
I've thought about it
every day for nearly 40 years now.

37:03.512 --> 37:07.891
I'm retiring this summer. It's only
now that I'm able to let it go.

37:09.518 --> 37:12.020
There is no answer.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.524
You'll only breathe life into
Henrik's obsession.

37:18.903 --> 37:22.405
Give it up before you become
obsessed yourself.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.167
What are you working on?

39:24.904 --> 39:29.199
- Who's this week's victim?
- Nobody.

39:35.498 --> 39:39.667
Still that reporter?
I thought you were done with him.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.129
Why do you keep at it?

39:44.632 --> 39:46.674
It's a bit slow.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.057
A new computer?

39:54.225 --> 39:59.687
- Yes, I need 20,000.
- Why do you need a 20,000 kroner PC?

40:00.689 --> 40:05.068
- So I can play, surf the internet.
- You often surf the internet?

40:07.154 --> 40:08.947
Do you chat?

40:19.125 --> 40:21.418
Know what, Lisbeth?

40:23.712 --> 40:26.714
I can't just hand you 20,000.

40:28.384 --> 40:31.386
- Not just like that.
- How hard can it be?

40:31.595 --> 40:34.389
Why can't I
look after my own money?

40:36.642 --> 40:39.227
Hit me. Come on.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.814
That's what you want, isn't it?
Hit me.

40:43.816 --> 40:47.735
If you give me any kind of trouble,
I'll make sure -

40:47.778 --> 40:51.573
- you spend the rest
of your life in a closed ward.

40:51.740 --> 40:56.161
I know all about your mental problems
and your violent background.

41:00.749 --> 41:03.209
Don't get me wrong, Lisbeth...

41:06.130 --> 41:09.048
I'm more than happy
to give you the 20,000.

41:10.676 --> 41:14.721
But, you know,
any business transaction -

41:16.682 --> 41:20.393
- is built on trust.
I have to feel that I can trust you.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.481
Can I trust you, baby?

41:27.818 --> 41:29.777
Can I trust you, Lisbeth?

41:47.171 --> 41:49.464
Can I trust you?

42:04.438 --> 42:06.814
If you're nice to me...

42:09.026 --> 42:12.737
If you're nice to me,
I'll always be nice to you.

42:56.740 --> 43:00.410
- It's only 7,000.
- More than enough for a computer.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.266
What are you looking at?

44:01.639 --> 44:06.392
You said it was a photographer
from the paper that shot the parade.

44:06.602 --> 44:09.937
Yes, he covered both the parade
and the accident.

44:10.022 --> 44:13.566
The old part of the archive
is a jumble.

44:13.776 --> 44:19.781
We haven't digitized it.
It's still kept in negative folders.

44:19.948 --> 44:22.659
20... 30...

44:23.952 --> 44:27.080
...40, 50, 60...

44:27.331 --> 44:30.917
A photographer uses
between two and ten rolls a day.

44:30.959 --> 44:34.170
Probably closer to ten
on Children's Day.

44:34.380 --> 44:37.006
Here. September 1966.

44:37.216 --> 44:40.468
I only need the hour
of the parade.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.763
- Knock yourself out.
- They're not sorted?

44:43.931 --> 44:47.600
If you're lucky,
they might be chronological.

44:47.810 --> 44:51.813
You don't happen to have
a negative scanner and a light table?

46:42.716 --> 46:46.093
This is the first lead in the case
in 39 years.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.095
It's a start.

46:51.225 --> 46:53.184
It's more than that.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.562
Look.

46:58.023 --> 46:59.982
You get my drift?

47:01.527 --> 47:05.363
Something catches her eye.
What is it that frightens her?

47:06.949 --> 47:08.658
Her killer.

47:10.118 --> 47:12.662
He was somewhere here.

47:12.913 --> 47:18.543
Harriet's killer is standing
across the street.

47:37.145 --> 47:42.149
- Coffee, Mikael?
- What have you found so far?

47:42.192 --> 47:45.570
I must've read...

47:46.822 --> 47:51.158
...several thousand pages. People
have worked on this for 40 years.

47:52.160 --> 47:56.622
To be perfectly honest, -

47:58.292 --> 48:01.210
- I haven't found a thing.

48:04.840 --> 48:09.302
Shouldn't you be in Stockholm
trying to appeal your verdict?

48:09.553 --> 48:12.471
- Give it a break.
- You give it a break.

48:13.223 --> 48:17.268
- Mikael's old enough to...
- I was set up.

48:19.187 --> 48:24.191
An old class-mate gave me a tip
concerning Wennerström's company.

48:24.318 --> 48:28.988
It was a good story.
Good enough to nail him.

48:29.156 --> 48:31.073
So you'd think.

48:31.199 --> 48:34.285
Yes, because suddenly there was
an even better story -

48:34.494 --> 48:38.289
- about fraud and gun-running
amounting to 60 million kroner.

48:39.583 --> 48:44.211
Wennerström's name was all over it.
So far, so good.

48:45.464 --> 48:50.134
Until I wrote the story.
Then all my sources disappeared.

48:50.218 --> 48:54.347
And all of the documents and evidence
turned out to be forged.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.307
Fake?

48:56.516 --> 49:00.269
So it was an attempt to lure you away
from the real scandal?

49:00.479 --> 49:03.064
It was too good to be true.

49:05.150 --> 49:08.903
Do you want something that really is
too good to be true?

49:14.534 --> 49:18.245
Single malt. 21 years old.

49:20.248 --> 49:24.251
To hell with all the troubles
of the past. Cheers.

49:24.378 --> 49:26.921
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

49:47.275 --> 49:49.527
How about one last glass of wine?

49:55.158 --> 49:57.535
I think I've had more than enough.

50:01.164 --> 50:04.917
- Thanks for a nice evening.
- Is it because of the investigation?

50:05.127 --> 50:07.920
Because of my secretive family?

50:08.130 --> 50:12.341
- What do you mean?
- It could be me. Right?

50:12.551 --> 50:16.303
I guess I'm also
on your list of suspects.

50:41.580 --> 50:44.331
- Bjurman.
- It's Lisbeth.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.460
- What do you want?
- I need more money.

50:49.713 --> 50:52.631
- We'll talk about it.
- I need it now.

51:01.641 --> 51:03.350
Welcome.

51:06.646 --> 51:08.481
Come on in.

51:12.360 --> 51:16.655
- I just want my money.
- You'll get your money.

51:16.865 --> 51:20.367
Thanks for your last visit. I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did.

51:20.494 --> 51:23.871
I won't give you a blowjob
every time I need money.

51:24.081 --> 51:27.792
Is that right?
Then what do you want?

51:29.669 --> 51:33.214
Do you want me to call
the probate department and say -

51:33.381 --> 51:37.218
- you've trespassed
and you're threatening me?

51:37.677 --> 51:41.764
Then we'll see how quickly
you're back in the psychiatric ward.

51:51.525 --> 51:52.566
So?

52:26.977 --> 52:28.936
That's much better.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.401
Like that.

52:36.486 --> 52:38.112
Come here.

52:40.490 --> 52:41.907
Come on.

53:04.055 --> 53:05.723
No!

54:01.029 --> 54:05.074
I've got... a rule for you to learn.

54:05.283 --> 54:07.785
If you put up a fight...

54:07.994 --> 54:11.705
Are you a good girl?
Are you a good girl now?

58:03.813 --> 58:11.528
NORSJÖ CARPENTERS

58:41.226 --> 58:45.354
My husband died many years ago.
So it's just me left.

58:47.065 --> 58:50.776
He worked there as a carpenter
for 24 years.

58:50.860 --> 58:55.822
They made everything
from clothes pegs to closets.

58:55.865 --> 58:59.868
He built that cabinet.
And the lamp, of course.

59:03.873 --> 59:05.666
More cake?

59:05.833 --> 59:10.504
Do you recall if you were in Hedestad
in September 1966?

59:10.713 --> 59:12.589
Hedestad...

59:12.799 --> 59:14.925
- In '66.
- Yes, in '66.

59:20.682 --> 59:25.519
- Oh, it was our honeymoon.
- Wonderful. Do you have snapshots?

59:25.728 --> 59:28.897
We went camping.
It was all the rage back then.

59:30.358 --> 59:33.944
It was our best holiday together.

59:34.862 --> 59:37.573
But I guess honeymoons
often are.

59:37.782 --> 59:42.286
- But do you have some snapshots?
- I sure do.

59:43.913 --> 59:47.833
Who doesn't save the photos
from their honeymoon?

59:50.545 --> 59:53.922
In the early years,
my husband and I hiked a lot.

59:54.132 --> 59:59.136
My husband was a skilled hiker.
We hiked for miles.

59:59.345 --> 01:00:02.556
He wasn't exactly romantic.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:05.309
Now, let's see.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.604
Hedestad...

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.943
Look.
So beautiful.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:19.865
Even if the photo
doesn't do the sunset justice.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.950
Let's see. Here's something.

01:00:23.244 --> 01:00:26.496
- There was a parade.
- Do you?

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:49.478
What are you doing here?
I'm on my way out.

01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:54.441
You've misunderstood the rules.
You have to make an appointment.

01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:56.902
Do you hear me?

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.647
Let me go.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.027
Do you hear me? Let me go.

01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:42.823
Do you like being tied up?

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:49.913
Or is your only turn-on
tying other people up?

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:11.059
It's great.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:15.272
Did you choose it yourself?
You didn't?

01:02:16.607 --> 01:02:18.567
I think it's perfect.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:49.514
You know that show where politicians
get busted by candid cameras?

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:52.100
We've got those cameras at work.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:55.353
I had one in my bag
last time I was here.

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:57.898
Welcome.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:03.111
I just thought you'd make me
give you a blowjob.

01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:05.614
But you're sicker
than I imagined.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:11.369
It goes on for two hours. Consider the
reaction of the police and the media.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:13.955
Enjoy.

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:17.751
Thanks for your last visit. I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.171
I won't give you a blowjob
every time I need money.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.966
Is that right?
Then what do you want?

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:05.882
I'll tell you how we'll do this.
You just nod.

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:12.055
I'll look after my own account.
You'll have no access.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.642
I control my own finances.

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:21.189
You got that?

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:25.735
Each month you write in your report
that my behavior is perfect.

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.738
Better than ever before.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:34.494
In exactly a year, you'll apply for
the termination of my guardianship.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.038
I'll send you further instructions.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:41.751
You can never contact me again.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:46.840
If you do, I'll send copies of
the video to the police and the press.

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:51.052
The same thing happens,
if I'm in an accident -

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.680
- or if you break my rules.

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:57.851
You got that? Good.

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:15.035
I've never done this before.
Lie still or it'll get messy.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.084
Lie still.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:05.794
I'M A SADIST PIG
AND A RAPIST

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:39.786
...during the last year...

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:44.207
...an avid interest in religion.

01:07:49.106 --> 01:07:50.857
SEND

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:04.079
The guy in the blue sweater.
I can't get his picture sharp.

01:08:04.288 --> 01:08:07.832
I can't do a thing about it.
It's so out of focus.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:12.420
- Are you sure?
- Positive. I've tried everything.

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:15.423
Okay, thanks for trying.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:30.438
Wasp...
Harriet's phone numbers.

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:44.993
Book of Leviticus...

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:15.608
"If a woman
approaches an animal..."

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:19.194
"If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations with it, -

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.363
- kill both the woman and the animal."

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.450
"Their blood
will be on their own heads."

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.495
Mari 32018.

01:09:29.456 --> 01:09:31.875
Magda 30112.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:35.420
Leviticus,
Chapter 1, Verse 12.

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:38.881
"...she is to bring two doves
or two young pigeons, -

01:09:39.049 --> 01:09:42.218
- one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering."

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.511
BJ 32027.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:47.515
"A man or a woman...

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:51.519
"A man or a woman who is a medium
or spiritist among you -

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:54.606
- must be put to death.
You are to stone them."

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:00.320
Must be put to death.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:16.002
Frode! What's going on?

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:19.255
It was Henrik.
He just collapsed.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:23.176
- We'll keep you informed.
- Thanks.

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:34.562
It's a heart attack.
He's having emergency surgery.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.024
What are his odds?

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.069
They're talking about a bypass
so it's serious.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.116
- You want coffee?
- No.

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:56.084
I think you should
go on with your investigation.

01:10:56.293 --> 01:10:59.671
- Have you assigned someone else?
- No, only you.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.300
Someone by the name of Wasp
has hacked into my computer.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:09.889
I've received an e-mail with copies
of one of my own documents.

01:11:11.308 --> 01:11:14.727
So this person must have
gained access to my hard drive.

01:11:18.023 --> 01:11:20.817
Do you know anything about this?

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.615
No...

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:31.119
No, but I think I've got
a good idea -

01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:34.122
- who it might be.

01:12:01.358 --> 01:12:03.359
Just stay in bed.

01:12:07.614 --> 01:12:09.991
Lisbeth Salander?

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.494
- Who are you?
- You know. May I come in?

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.045
I've read your report.
Thrilling stuff.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:26.966
Particularly that you stole my files.
The police would find that intriguing.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:31.929
They also ought to know that you
are still hacking into my computer.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:43.399
If you remove those papers,
I'll take off the chain.

01:12:54.828 --> 01:12:56.579
What do you want?

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:03.086
- Hi.
- Everything all right?

01:13:11.845 --> 01:13:14.806
- What do you want?
- You got any coffee?

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:41.666
How much do you know
about my assignment?

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:44.585
The 40-year-old murder
of a 16-year-old girl.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:50.591
Until today I wasn't even sure
that she was killed.

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:54.011
Then you directed me to
the Biblical references -

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:56.889
- about women
who should be killed.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:01.811
- And?
- It's the most important clue so far.

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:08.443
- And?
- I need your help.

01:14:10.737 --> 01:14:14.073
- I'll pay good money.
- I've already got a job.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.577
You work as a professional hacker, -

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:21.122
- but send me an e-mail
I can easily trace.

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:26.627
Why?

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.843
Huh?

01:15:09.796 --> 01:15:12.048
So he'll live?

01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:18.971
Can I visit him?

01:15:21.391 --> 01:15:23.768
Lisbeth Salander's here.

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:34.153
Okay, Frode.
Talk to you soon. Thanks.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:53.798
If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations...

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:59.720
As we've been sharing files lately,
I assume you're up to date.

01:16:01.181 --> 01:16:02.723
I am.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.148
You know... What if these quotes
don't have anything to do with God?

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:13.943
What if it's a code?

01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:17.738
Sara Witt was found murdered
in her family's barn -

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:20.658
- outside Vilhelmina in 1962.

01:16:21.159 --> 01:16:23.536
Sara? What else does it say?

01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:27.373
"Between 2 and 3 am,
the victim was lured..."

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:35.047
"The woman's body was mutilated,
possibly in a religious ritual.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.800
The police won't disclose
any more details."

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:42.305
Mutilated, possibly religious...
Did they find the killer?

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:48.394
No. The case was never solved.

01:16:51.648 --> 01:16:54.775
- It's a wild guess.
- I know.

01:16:55.777 --> 01:17:00.156
- How far is it to Vilhelmina?
- Too far on a motorcycle.

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:22.094
What are we waiting for?

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.805
- You want to drive?
- Why?

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:31.020
- I haven't driven since my divorce.
- Then it's about time.

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:55.044
Why do female names
always bring you to porn sites?

01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:56.962
What are you doing?

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:02.843
I'm getting the computer to search
all the newspaper databases.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:49.890
Let's go to the barn.

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:56.021
They couldn't sell the farm
after what happened.

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:59.108
It's been empty ever since.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:05.614
This is where she was found?

01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:10.536
Yes. Her husband found her.
It was horrific for him. Horrific.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:14.915
She was lying right here.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.962
In this booth.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:23.466
Bound and tortured.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.853
Were the animals also harmed?

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:39.148
How did you know?

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.945
"If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations with it, -

01:19:45.071 --> 01:19:47.740
- kill both the woman and the animal."

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:54.413
- It might be a coincidence.
- Yes.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.420
Goddamn, Lisbeth.

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:06.008
If the others also fit...

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:15.851
I've found an old TV program.

01:20:18.271 --> 01:20:21.941
A program from 1999
about a murder in Dalarna.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.025
Go on.

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:27.112
"In the series 'Swedish Murders' comes
the case of Magda Lovisa Sjöberg -

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:28.989
- from Dalarna."

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:32.201
Magda...

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:36.789
"A brutal murder puzzle from
November 1954 that baffled the police."

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:39.375
Didn't we have a Magda reference?

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:42.253
Leviticus,
Chapter 1, Verse 12.

01:20:42.462 --> 01:20:45.548
"He is to cut it into pieces...
including the head and the fat."

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:49.927
"And the priest shall arrange them...
on the burning wood on the altar."

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:53.013
That was verbatim.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:58.018
You quoted it word for word.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:16.287
As far as I know, Magda's body
was found after only six hours.

01:21:17.497 --> 01:21:20.165
By a farmer who saw
the smoke from the fire.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:23.502
He thought it was
some kids having a party.

01:21:25.338 --> 01:21:28.090
Someone cut out fat from the body.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:36.682
That's right. They found remains
of fat together with the head.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:40.102
Awful.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.103
What the hell?
Relax!

01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:27.149
I just wanted to wake you up.
We're there.

01:22:42.999 --> 01:22:44.750
Can I come in?

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.130
Here's your bag.

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:58.806
Are you okay?

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.434
Yes, I'm okay.

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:40.180
I can't find anyone
who fits the initials BJ.

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:45.019
But LI could be Liv Ingvartsson.

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:49.481
A prostitute who disappeared in Ånge
and was found on a building site.

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.442
What was that quote again?

01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:53.986
"...she is to bring two doves
or two young pigeons, -

01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:56.196
- one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering."

01:23:56.322 --> 01:23:59.491
"The priest will make atonement
for her, and she will be clean."

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:03.620
Ånge... That's quite a few miles
in the direction we came from.

01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:15.841
I think I've found another one.
A 17-year-old girl from Uppsala.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:19.094
- When?
- 1964.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:24.058
"The Mari murder empties the streets".
"Killer still on the loose".

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:28.020
There.

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:34.651
Now we've got Sara, Mari,
Magda and Liv. Four murders.

01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:38.113
Now we only need BJ,
who's been circled.

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:40.324
Harriet can't have known them.

01:24:40.533 --> 01:24:46.538
Liv was murdered in 1949. Harriet was
born in 1950. What's the connection?

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:50.793
She listed women who'd been killed
and she disappeared.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:53.504
Harriet must've known
who the killer was.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.357
What is it?

01:25:14.567 --> 01:25:16.485
Somebody's been here.

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:24.284
The pictures have been touched.
The Bible is pointing in another direction.

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:30.124
- Look.
- What the hell?

01:25:31.167 --> 01:25:33.669
Someone has been curious.

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:46.348
I'll buy a new lock tomorrow.

01:25:59.612 --> 01:26:02.990
Lisbeth...
do you have a photographic memory?

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:23.552
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:28.015
It's fantastic if you do.
I wish that I had it.

01:26:55.418 --> 01:26:58.378
Damn, you gave me a scare.

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:01.381
What is it?

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.431
What are you doing?

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.409
Are you sure it's a good idea?

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:24.506
- Are you leaving?
- Good night.

01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:48.196
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:29:11.471 --> 01:29:13.430
Did you sleep well?

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.531
- I'm updating Henrik. Want to come?
- I hate hospitals.

01:29:37.163 --> 01:29:40.540
But that's...
But that's totally absurd.

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:45.921
You've found out more
than I'd hoped for.

01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:50.550
Just concentrate on getting well.

01:29:52.678 --> 01:29:55.222
I'll keep you updated.

01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:57.682
Regarding the last reference...

01:29:57.934 --> 01:30:00.018
- The last name.
- BJ.

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:02.604
Ask Morell if he can help you.

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:10.112
Morell!

01:30:13.574 --> 01:30:16.159
I'll be damned!
Five murders!

01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:20.872
It wasn't phone numbers.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:24.292
If it's any consolation,
it wasn't me who cracked it.

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:28.088
We haven't found the last woman
with the initials BJ.

01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:32.968
She's circled as if she's particularly
important. It's the last reference.

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:38.098
If there's a woman with these initials
who died in the 40's, 50's or 60's, -

01:30:38.182 --> 01:30:43.478
- we've got to find her.
Do you realize what this means?

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:46.606
If the first murder
took place in 1949, -

01:30:46.816 --> 01:30:50.068
- the man who's been sending
Henrik flowers is now very old.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:53.155
It reduces the number of
suspects considerably.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:22.100
Mikael. We're glad you could make it.
Welcome.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:25.145
Harald couldn't make it.
He's hunting deer.

01:31:29.358 --> 01:31:31.693
To what do I owe the honor?

01:31:31.944 --> 01:31:34.988
Have you read
the local paper recently?

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:37.157
I've been out of town.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:42.120
They're coming out with quite
an interesting series -

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.664
- on your exile here on Hedeby.

01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:48.001
BLOMKVIST'S YOUNG NEW GIRLFRIEND

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:53.423
- And?
- We don't like it.

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:56.468
Henrik is dying.

01:31:56.677 --> 01:32:00.805
My private life has nothing to do
with my assignment for Henrik.

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:04.601
It reflects on everyone
in the Vanger Group.

01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:09.481
Haven't you done enough harm? Do you
have to give Henrik a heart attack -

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:12.275
- by picking over
my daughter's death?

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:18.448
- Maybe it's about time you gave up.
- What do you mean?

01:32:18.658 --> 01:32:22.202
You're making matters worse
by coming here with your whore.

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:24.704
Don't use that tone, Mom.

01:32:24.914 --> 01:32:29.751
But maybe you should take a break now.
It's been a pretty hard deal.

01:32:32.129 --> 01:32:34.756
- I'm needed here.
- Mikael, as your friend...

01:32:35.007 --> 01:32:41.221
Excuse me, but I have something
to say. Henrik signed a contract.

01:32:42.682 --> 01:32:46.935
As long as he lives,
it cannot be cancelled.

01:32:47.144 --> 01:32:52.440
So whether Mikael likes it or not,
he has to continue.

01:33:06.455 --> 01:33:10.083
I'm sorry that it had to be
so dramatic.

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:13.920
- Why are you wearing Harriet's necklace?
- What do you mean?

01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:18.675
Harriet was wearing it when she
disappeared. Now you're wearing it.

01:33:18.884 --> 01:33:22.095
What are you trying to say?
Are you accusing me?

01:33:23.306 --> 01:33:25.807
Just tell me
where you got it from.

01:33:26.058 --> 01:33:30.645
I inherited it from Anita.
It never belonged to Harriet.

01:33:35.484 --> 01:33:37.902
Anita, your sister?

01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:50.290
Hi, Micke.

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:54.294
Everything all right?

01:34:05.848 --> 01:34:08.933
Anita is Harriet.
I was mistaken. It's not her.

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.977
What are you talking about?

01:34:11.187 --> 01:34:14.981
They both looked after me that summer.
It's Anita's necklace.

01:34:18.694 --> 01:34:23.239
Yes, it's Anita.
Shit, those two were so alike.

01:34:23.949 --> 01:34:27.952
- What do we know about Anita Vanger?
- Harriet's cousin and closest friend.

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:31.873
They were together each summer.
She had no alibi, but wasn't a suspect.

01:34:32.124 --> 01:34:35.335
Right after Harriet's death,
she moved to London to study.

01:34:35.378 --> 01:34:40.048
She had a brilliant career, but died
from breast cancer when she was 37.

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.133
She died 20 years ago.

01:34:43.302 --> 01:34:46.012
She didn't tell Morell
it was her in the window.

01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:50.850
- Maybe she had something to hide.
- Maybe she was covering for the killer.

01:35:00.277 --> 01:35:03.655
Hi, Plague. I need help.
Will you run a check on Anita Vanger?

01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:12.330
- Plague?
- If there is anything, he'll find it.

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:52.972
- What happened?
- Some idiot shot at me.

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:57.936
- Did you see who?
- No. Shit.

01:37:02.566 --> 01:37:06.152
We must be very close now.
And someone doesn't like it.

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:09.113
Give me my cell phone.
We have to call the police.

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:11.616
- What can they do?
- Go get it.

01:37:11.867 --> 01:37:13.993
Then I'm out of here.

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:24.754
Let's not jump to
any conclusions.

01:37:24.964 --> 01:37:27.632
It could be a hunting accident.

01:37:27.883 --> 01:37:31.219
If it's not a hunting accident,
then you're not safe here.

01:37:32.721 --> 01:37:36.516
I think you should go home.
At least for a while.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.895
Ever since I came here,
everyone keeps asking me to leave.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:46.401
Anything new on BJ?

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:51.531
We didn't find a BJ in the system.
But we'll keep on searching.

01:37:52.408 --> 01:37:54.951
Two cameras outside
and fire in here -

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.246
- connected to sensors.
I've got the cottage covered.

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:03.418
Fantastic.

01:38:12.803 --> 01:38:15.430
I take it you don't want to go home?

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:20.476
No.

01:38:30.529 --> 01:38:32.572
So now we've got it on tape?

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:38.369
Yes.
It's already on the internet.

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.680
- What are you doing?
- Sorry?

01:38:57.890 --> 01:39:01.476
- Go sleep in your own bed.
- I want to be close to you.

01:39:04.897 --> 01:39:07.148
Okay, but I want to sleep.

01:39:18.243 --> 01:39:22.330
What has happened to you?
How did you turn out this way?

01:39:26.752 --> 01:39:31.631
You know everything about me.
I don't know shit about you.

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.593
Not a damn thing.

01:39:37.554 --> 01:39:39.639
That's the way it is.

01:40:17.302 --> 01:40:19.679
- Who is it?
- Morell.

01:40:23.225 --> 01:40:25.685
I've found the last one.

01:40:25.894 --> 01:40:29.605
Rebecka Jacobsson,
nickname Bea.

01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:32.066
BJ.

01:40:33.652 --> 01:40:36.571
That's why we didn't find her.

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:41.701
"A man or a woman who is a medium
or a spiritist among you...

01:40:41.744 --> 01:40:45.121
...must be put to death.
You are to stone them."

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:50.168
It's her.

01:40:51.253 --> 01:40:53.963
- Where was she killed?
- In Karlstad.

01:40:54.173 --> 01:40:56.591
But that's not the interesting part.

01:40:56.717 --> 01:41:02.096
Rebecka worked for the Vanger Group
until her death in January 1965.

01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:06.517
As a secretary for Gottfried Vanger.

01:41:06.685 --> 01:41:09.854
Gottfried died before Harriet disappeared.
So it wasn't him.

01:41:10.105 --> 01:41:14.525
But we've got to check if she knew
other members of the Vanger family.

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:20.615
- Hold on.
- What?

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:23.242
Rebecka and Sara are Jewish names.

01:41:23.452 --> 01:41:25.203
- Magda...
- Magdalena.

01:41:27.122 --> 01:41:29.749
Mari, Maria. But Liv?

01:41:33.962 --> 01:41:38.424
Liv means Eve. I bet that
Liv Ingvartsson was Jewish as well.

01:41:38.634 --> 01:41:42.970
Racist murders. It fits with the
pseudo religious rituals.

01:41:45.015 --> 01:41:47.475
But what about Harriet?

01:41:47.684 --> 01:41:51.187
Harriet died because she
discovered a pattern.

01:41:51.396 --> 01:41:53.773
How the hell could we miss it?

01:41:53.857 --> 01:41:57.777
They're Jewish names. There were
three Nazis in the Vanger family.

01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.696
Only one was still alive
when Harriet died.

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:02.907
Harald.

01:42:04.743 --> 01:42:07.870
Who happened to be hunting
when you ran alone in the woods.

01:42:16.213 --> 01:42:18.881
The first murder
took place there in 1949.

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:23.636
Then Dalarna, Vilhelmina,
Uppsala, Karlstad.

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:27.265
If Harald has been there,
he's left traces.

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:31.686
- What do you mean?
- The Vanger Group accounts.

01:42:31.812 --> 01:42:36.524
Business travels. There must be
evidence. Restaurant and hotel bills.

01:42:36.733 --> 01:42:39.819
You think he got a tax deduction
for murder?

01:42:39.945 --> 01:42:43.072
Well, I know about businessmen.

01:42:44.116 --> 01:42:47.827
Even if we can prove he's been
everywhere, it's not enough.

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:56.836
- Maybe he's hunting now.
- You suggest we break into his house?

01:43:58.607 --> 01:44:01.317
We need to go
back quite a few years.

01:44:02.778 --> 01:44:05.905
89... 89...

01:44:06.114 --> 01:44:08.908
We need the accounts
from 1949 until 1966.

01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:12.328
Thank Henrik for his old-fashioned
business practices.

01:44:12.537 --> 01:44:15.539
Otherwise, they would've been
shredded long ago.

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:19.043
Well, there they all are,
knock yourself out.

01:44:22.005 --> 01:44:26.801
Miss Salander,
what exactly have you found so far?

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:29.345
Thank you, that was all.

01:45:13.557 --> 01:45:16.225
IN THE NAME OF THE FÜHRER
I BESTOW...

01:45:54.056 --> 01:45:57.725
What in God's name are you doing here?
Answer me!

01:45:58.727 --> 01:46:00.353
Take it easy.

01:46:00.562 --> 01:46:05.149
You're gonna write about me
in your damn communist magazine?

01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:07.902
I'm leaving now. Don't shoot.

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:12.323
You broke into my home,
so I'm free to kill you.

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:15.076
What the hell is going on here?

01:46:15.952 --> 01:46:18.954
- Freeze!
- Drop the gun, Harald.

01:46:19.081 --> 01:46:22.208
- Come on, drop the gun.
- It's none of your business!

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:27.797
Drop the gun. Drop it.

01:46:40.102 --> 01:46:41.519
Are you okay?

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:46.649
How the hell could Gottfried have
such a wuss of a son?

01:47:00.789 --> 01:47:02.123
Harald...

01:47:07.587 --> 01:47:19.140
No.

01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:29.442
- We've got to call Morell.
- We can call him from my place.

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:35.239
Harald's not going anywhere.
Come on.

01:47:56.553 --> 01:47:58.637
Gottfried?

01:48:09.191 --> 01:48:10.733
Gottfried.

01:48:25.499 --> 01:48:27.333
Uppsala 1964!

01:48:44.601 --> 01:48:46.644
January, February...

01:48:54.528 --> 01:48:57.238
Wasn't there a group photo?

01:49:02.244 --> 01:49:03.953
What the fuck?

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.666
It can't be true.

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:17.633
Blue sweater...

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:30.271
What the fuck?

01:49:32.107 --> 01:49:33.566
Shit.

01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:53.711
Feeling better now?

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.840
- He gave me a hell of a scare.
- You don't mess with Harald.

01:49:58.967 --> 01:50:01.302
What were you doing in his house?

01:50:03.138 --> 01:50:08.559
Harriet discovered a handful of
murders from the 40's to the 60's.

01:50:08.768 --> 01:50:12.938
We know she found a pattern
the police didn't know about.

01:50:13.148 --> 01:50:16.108
We believe that's why
she was killed.

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.780
But that...
It sounds totally insane.

01:50:22.449 --> 01:50:25.868
We've found a pattern
regarding the victims.

01:50:26.328 --> 01:50:29.038
They've all got Jewish names.

01:50:29.247 --> 01:50:34.335
Well, Harald isn't exactly crazy about
Abraham's kin.

01:50:34.544 --> 01:50:38.339
No. So I went to his house
to see if I could find anything.

01:50:40.342 --> 01:50:43.010
- And?
- Well, what do I know?

01:50:44.846 --> 01:50:47.014
He turned up so soon.

01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:51.769
But he didn't exactly act innocent.

01:50:54.022 --> 01:50:58.025
If Lisbeth can track down his
travel activities from the accounts, -

01:50:58.234 --> 01:51:01.862
- we've got evidence against him.
Bills, invoices.

01:51:02.072 --> 01:51:03.864
She's going through everything.

01:51:17.295 --> 01:51:19.880
Very well. I'll call the police.

01:51:21.007 --> 01:51:22.800
Try Morell.

01:51:49.327 --> 01:51:51.412
What were you doing at Harald's?

01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:56.208
There, there.

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:38.333
Scream as much as you want to, Mikael.
Scream as much as you can.

01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:40.461
You think anyone'll hear you?

01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:11.617
We both know how it's
going to end for you.

01:53:21.878 --> 01:53:23.504
Why?

01:53:24.714 --> 01:53:26.507
Why what?

01:53:27.509 --> 01:53:29.885
- All of this.
- Why not?

01:53:31.387 --> 01:53:35.182
I do what every man dreams of.
I take what I want.

01:53:37.769 --> 01:53:40.521
How many women after the first?

01:53:42.023 --> 01:53:45.442
I don't know. I've lost count.

01:53:45.527 --> 01:53:49.780
I had a girl in that cage
when we were dining upstairs.

01:53:51.533 --> 01:53:55.786
Those kinds of women disappear
all the time. Nobody misses them.

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:59.540
Whores, immigrants.

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:16.265
What do you do with them? What about
the references? The mutilations?

01:54:20.061 --> 01:54:25.399
That was my father's project. He mixed
his hobby with race and religion.

01:54:25.567 --> 01:54:30.571
But it was a mistake.
You shouldn't leave the bodies behind.

01:54:34.659 --> 01:54:39.621
I take them for a trip in my boat
and then I drop them into the sea.

01:54:52.594 --> 01:54:54.386
Mikael?

01:55:27.921 --> 01:55:30.047
Mari was my first.

01:55:33.509 --> 01:55:34.843
64.

01:55:36.304 --> 01:55:37.930
You were 16 years old.

01:55:38.139 --> 01:55:43.685
It was Dad, Gottfried, who taught me
how I should strangle her.

01:55:53.029 --> 01:55:54.905
It's sick.

01:55:55.657 --> 01:55:57.741
It's mainly for the sex.

01:55:59.327 --> 01:56:04.456
When I put them down, it's only
a logical consequence of the rape.

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:06.917
You can't leave any witnesses.

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:12.047
Even though I have to admit
I love seeing their disappointment.

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:18.637
- Disappointment?
- When they realize they'll die.

01:56:20.139 --> 01:56:25.143
It doesn't really fit into
their scheme of things.

01:56:25.353 --> 01:56:28.689
They always think
I'll show them mercy.

01:56:31.192 --> 01:56:33.694
It's a fantastic moment -

01:56:35.697 --> 01:56:38.991
- when they realize
they're not going to get away.

01:56:41.077 --> 01:56:43.078
When the eyes...

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.623
...switch off and die.

01:56:48.626 --> 01:56:50.961
You'll experience that yourself.

01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:58.677
And your sister? What did it feel like
when your sister's eyes died?

01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:01.763
- Harriet disappeared.
- You want me to believe that?

01:57:01.973 --> 01:57:04.224
Believe whatever the hell you want.

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:11.106
I would have enjoyed killing her.
But she disappeared.

01:57:11.816 --> 01:57:13.942
Just like you'll disappear.

01:57:20.742 --> 01:57:22.868
Do you want some water?

01:57:26.664 --> 01:57:27.873
Yes, please.

01:57:42.805 --> 01:57:44.264
Thanks.

01:57:45.767 --> 01:57:49.603
You see...
you're just like everybody else.

01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:56.735
It only takes a simple, human gesture
to ignite the small hope -

01:57:56.778 --> 01:58:00.447
- that I might let you go after all.

01:58:03.785 --> 01:58:05.410
Right?

01:58:38.694 --> 01:58:41.446
Take it easy. It'll be quick.

01:58:43.908 --> 01:58:47.744
I'm mostly looking forward to
your little girlfriend.

01:59:02.844 --> 01:59:04.845
Come on, motherfucker.

01:59:21.863 --> 01:59:23.822
Are you okay?

02:00:06.449 --> 02:00:08.283
Fuck!

02:01:27.989 --> 02:01:33.493
I can't...

02:01:35.663 --> 02:01:43.003
I can't move.

02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:48.008
Help me.

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:53.013
Please help me.

02:03:51.424 --> 02:03:56.344
- Where's Martin?
- He's not coming back.

02:04:00.015 --> 02:04:01.933
What do you mean?

02:04:03.811 --> 02:04:06.020
He drove to his death.

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:13.987
- He's finished.
- Are you positive?

02:04:17.533 --> 02:04:19.826
What the hell did you do?

02:04:21.704 --> 02:04:25.248
He died in a car accident.
We don't know anything. Okay?

02:04:34.383 --> 02:04:35.842
Blomkvist!

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:41.473
- What the hell happened here?
- The cellar.

02:05:05.706 --> 02:05:07.749
What happened out there?

02:05:13.631 --> 02:05:15.423
He didn't die in an accident, did he?

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:21.763
Damn, Lisbeth.

02:05:22.223 --> 02:05:26.768
His father taught him to kill
when he was 16 years old.

02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:30.772
That would make anybody
sick in the brain.

02:05:30.898 --> 02:05:35.068
Don't make him into a fucking victim.
He nearly killed you.

02:05:35.277 --> 02:05:37.987
He was a killer and a rapist
and he enjoyed it.

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:42.492
He had the same chances as everyone
else. You choose who you want to be.

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:46.996
He wasn't a victim. He was an
evil motherfucker who hated women.

02:05:52.211 --> 02:05:54.212
How did he die?

02:05:59.677 --> 02:06:01.344
He burned to death.

02:06:06.642 --> 02:06:09.644
- Could you have saved him?
- Yes.

02:06:10.312 --> 02:06:13.356
- But you let him burn.
- Yes.

02:06:58.944 --> 02:07:01.863
I would never have done that, Lisbeth.

02:07:03.741 --> 02:07:06.701
But I understand why you did it.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.832
I don't know what you've been through.

02:07:16.086 --> 02:07:19.172
But I almost died in that cellar -

02:07:20.591 --> 02:07:22.884
- and you saved my life.

02:07:28.891 --> 02:07:31.309
Whatever it is you've been through, -

02:07:33.896 --> 02:07:36.522
- you don't have to tell me.

02:07:40.277 --> 02:07:42.403
I'm just glad you're here.

02:07:53.874 --> 02:07:55.291
Thanks.

02:08:12.893 --> 02:08:15.645
For the first time in my life
I feel old.

02:08:28.951 --> 02:08:33.204
- We're not finished yet.
- What do you mean?

02:08:34.039 --> 02:08:38.251
- Harriet wasn't one of Martin's victims.
- What are you saying?

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:41.170
Martin didn't kill Harriet.

02:08:49.972 --> 02:08:56.269
Lisbeth?

02:09:20.627 --> 02:09:24.964
Two women bear the name Anita Vanger.
One of them died in London.

02:09:25.007 --> 02:09:30.803
The other one lives in Australia.
First entry into the country in 1966.

02:10:40.457 --> 02:10:42.124
Harriet?

02:10:45.587 --> 02:11:00.101
Harriet Vanger?

02:11:02.104 --> 02:11:04.063
Everything's all right?

02:11:13.407 --> 02:11:18.369
Yes. You and your cousin babysat me
when I was a small boy.

02:11:21.123 --> 02:11:24.125
But I'm here on behalf of
Henrik Vanger.

02:11:37.806 --> 02:11:39.515
Does he know I'm alive?

02:11:44.354 --> 02:11:46.147
Not yet.

02:12:03.874 --> 02:12:06.292
I'm here to visit Agneta Salander.

02:12:06.543 --> 02:12:10.004
- Who can I say it is?
- Her daughter.

02:12:10.172 --> 02:12:13.591
Her daughter?
Are you Agneta's daughter?

02:12:15.802 --> 02:12:19.180
I'm sorry, it's just...
I've never seen you before.

02:12:57.678 --> 02:12:59.261
Hi, Mom.

02:13:02.891 --> 02:13:04.225
Mom?

02:13:06.895 --> 02:13:09.230
It's me. Lisbeth.

02:13:18.156 --> 02:13:19.907
Lisbeth...

02:13:28.291 --> 02:13:30.334
Are you Lisbeth?

02:13:32.254 --> 02:13:35.256
I wanted to come
a long time ago.

02:13:43.765 --> 02:13:46.142
You look so different now.

02:13:52.899 --> 02:13:56.277
- Do you have kids?
- No.

02:14:00.198 --> 02:14:02.116
A boyfriend?

02:14:06.997 --> 02:14:08.956
There is someone...

02:14:14.838 --> 02:14:17.339
...but you should never fall in love.

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.010
You know that better than anyone.

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:28.142
Right, Mom?

02:14:36.318 --> 02:14:39.320
I should have picked
a better father for you.

02:14:40.947 --> 02:14:45.159
Let it be, Mom.
It was you he harmed.

02:14:53.168 --> 02:14:54.794
Mom...

02:15:06.139 --> 02:15:07.890
Come in.

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:16.357
Mikael. Welcome back.

02:15:19.027 --> 02:15:23.364
I've got a nice surprise. Promise me
you won't have a heart attack.

02:15:23.573 --> 02:15:27.660
With all the pills
I'm popping at the moment, -

02:15:27.869 --> 02:15:31.372
- I think it's physically impossible
to have a heart attack.

02:15:59.317 --> 02:16:01.110
Harriet?

02:16:22.924 --> 02:16:24.717
Forgive me.

02:16:35.437 --> 02:16:42.401
I'm sorry.

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:56.457
I was 14 when Dad raped me
for the first time.

02:16:57.876 --> 02:17:00.920
A year later he took me
to his cottage.

02:17:03.255 --> 02:17:05.090
Then Martin joined in.

02:17:08.428 --> 02:17:13.474
They abused me again
several times after that.

02:17:17.437 --> 02:17:19.480
One day I'd had enough.

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:26.486
Dad was drunk as usual.

02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:39.708
He reeled off Bible verses and boasted
about all the women he'd killed.

02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:50.302
I took the oar and hit him hard.

02:17:59.521 --> 02:18:03.065
I pressed him under the water
till it got still.

02:18:21.209 --> 02:18:24.670
Then I pushed the boat out
to make it look like an accident.

02:18:27.048 --> 02:18:29.508
But when I turned around...

02:18:32.387 --> 02:18:34.596
...Martin was there.

02:18:37.475 --> 02:18:40.602
Martin treated me even worse
than Gottfried.

02:18:41.938 --> 02:18:45.023
You sent him to a boarding school
in Uppsala, -

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:48.693
- but on Children's Day
he came back.

02:18:50.864 --> 02:18:54.532
I was terrified
it would start all over again.

02:19:02.959 --> 02:19:05.294
And then you went to Anita?

02:19:06.087 --> 02:19:10.257
Anita helped me get out of here.

02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:14.803
When the bridge was opened,
she drove the car.

02:19:15.013 --> 02:19:19.516
I was in the back seat
under a blanket.

02:19:23.730 --> 02:19:26.607
I've been thinking of you
all these years.

02:19:26.733 --> 02:19:32.154
I sent you the framed flowers -

02:19:32.405 --> 02:19:36.407
- because I wanted to tell you
that I was out there somewhere.

02:19:39.287 --> 02:19:44.625
So I was sad to hear Mikael say
what you'd read into them.

02:19:45.627 --> 02:19:50.756
If you hadn't sent them,
you wouldn't be sitting here now.

02:20:00.725 --> 02:20:02.309
No.

02:20:18.827 --> 02:20:21.036
Lisbeth, it's me again.

02:20:22.705 --> 02:20:25.040
Call me if you hear this.

02:20:27.877 --> 02:20:31.713
I hope you're doing okay.
Call me.

02:20:45.145 --> 02:20:46.520
You've got a visitor.

02:20:47.147 --> 02:20:48.939
Thirty minutes.

02:20:56.906 --> 02:20:59.324
I'm so happy to see you.

02:21:06.458 --> 02:21:07.875
Here.

02:21:08.626 --> 02:21:11.211
- What's this?
- A bit of reading.

02:21:18.470 --> 02:21:22.764
- Don't you want to sit down?
- I just wanted to give you that.

02:21:41.784 --> 02:21:44.578
I've only got
a month and a half left.

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:17.945
EVERYBODY'S GOT SECRETS

02:23:00.822 --> 02:23:06.702
Wennerström's empire resembles
a living, breathing organism...

02:23:09.205 --> 02:23:13.166
Reporter Mikael Blomkvist,
who served a prison sentence -

02:23:13.209 --> 02:23:16.336
- for libelling the tycoon
Hans-Erik Wennerström -

02:23:16.588 --> 02:23:19.089
- now accuses Wennerström again.

02:23:19.215 --> 02:23:21.842
In the magazine Millennium, -

02:23:22.051 --> 02:23:25.887
- Blomkvist accuses Wennerström
of using his companies -

02:23:26.097 --> 02:23:28.890
- to commit serious financial crimes.

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:32.644
- Why are you going after him again?
- It makes you wonder.

02:23:32.854 --> 02:23:36.231
- What will happen to Wennerström?
- There's an empty cell now.

02:23:36.316 --> 02:23:41.445
Blomkvist describes a financial
empire based on Third World cartels.

02:23:41.654 --> 02:23:47.451
Cartels involved in
drug trafficking and gun-running.

02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:49.953
There he is!

02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:55.125
Cheers!

02:23:55.251 --> 02:23:58.211
The wanted tycoon Wennerström -

02:23:58.254 --> 02:24:02.466
- was found dead this morning
