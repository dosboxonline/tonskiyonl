03:34.826 --> 03:38.832
THE GIRL WITH THE NEEDLE

03:57.593 --> 03:59.801
- Who is it?
- Jensen.

04:00.218 --> 04:01.926
Just a moment.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.343
Yes?

04:11.426 --> 04:14.718
- Karoline, I have to ask you to move.
- What?

04:14.885 --> 04:19.843
I have to ask you to move out.
I need the room for somebody else.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.801
- I live here.
- But you don't pay.

04:22.926 --> 04:26.468
- I'll pay.
- Karoline?

04:31.093 --> 04:34.718
- Let me get dressed!
- You have to understand...

04:35.417 --> 04:37.634
I have to show them the room now.

04:44.968 --> 04:46.843
- How much do I owe?
- 14 weeks.

04:47.176 --> 04:51.010
- You'll get the money tomorrow.
- The chimney needs sweeping.

04:51.176 --> 04:54.385
- Get it done this time.
- I know!

04:55.010 --> 04:58.093
You'll get it tomorrow. What's going on?

04:58.260 --> 05:03.260
- Take your hand off my shoulder.
- I have lived here for years.

05:09.635 --> 05:12.218
- I have money.
- No, Karoline.

05:31.760 --> 05:35.092
Sorry for the delay.
Please follow me.

05:35.093 --> 05:38.426
There's no room for you to see.
I'm sorry.

05:40.801 --> 05:45.801
- Here's for three and a half weeks.
- Do you want me to go to the police?

05:46.260 --> 05:51.843
Force me to take you to court
to get the outstanding money off you?

05:54.343 --> 05:56.051
I'm not being cruel.

05:56.635 --> 06:00.218
I'm reasonable and patient. Polite, even.

06:01.551 --> 06:02.968
Please follow me.

06:15.218 --> 06:17.426
There is running water
between 10 and 12 o'clock.

06:18.926 --> 06:22.135
Here's the kitchen. Karoline, please.

06:28.968 --> 06:32.218
- The oven smokes badly.
- The chimney will be swept today.

06:33.843 --> 06:35.135
We have rats.

06:37.093 --> 06:38.426
Big rats.

06:39.510 --> 06:40.801
They come out at night.

06:41.426 --> 06:45.010
When you're asleep, they bite your feet.

06:45.176 --> 06:47.801
- Karoline, enough.
- There are many of them.

06:48.885 --> 06:50.760
I don't want to live here.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.826
I don't want to live here.
I want to go home.

07:17.760 --> 07:18.926
It will do.

07:22.468 --> 07:25.873
I'll arrange for a carriage tomorrow.
You can use it afterwards, if you like.

07:27.426 --> 07:29.426
I'll make sure the price is reasonable.

07:37.708 --> 07:38.958
Come on.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.843
Do you have a place to stay?

07:52.176 --> 07:54.510
I can help you find a room you can afford.

09:36.385 --> 09:38.343
No talking, get on with it.

09:46.051 --> 09:49.593
- You are holding up the line.
- The needle keeps breaking.

09:50.093 --> 09:51.801
Then be careful.

09:54.551 --> 09:56.051
"Then be careful".

10:41.635 --> 10:44.801
- How much is it?
- 15 kroner per week.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.885
That's a lot.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.176
- What about water?
- In the yard.

11:02.968 --> 11:04.968
There is a bucket in the cupboard.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.843
No guests allowed.

11:10.301 --> 11:11.468
Sure.

11:38.385 --> 11:39.426
Yes?

11:42.260 --> 11:44.093
The seamstress you wanted to see.

11:46.176 --> 11:48.260
Please. Come in.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.843
We have received your letter,
asking for the widow supplement.

12:07.676 --> 12:09.093
How are you coping?

12:10.968 --> 12:13.301
I have been evicted
from my apartment...

12:15.135 --> 12:16.468
Mr Director.

12:18.843 --> 12:21.676
- Any news of your husband?
- No.

12:25.051 --> 12:29.218
Without your husband's death certificate,
I'm unable to grant your request.

12:34.176 --> 12:38.343
But your letter moved me.
Your circumstances are...

12:40.260 --> 12:41.885
Well...

12:49.468 --> 12:51.301
May I ask your husband's name?

12:53.385 --> 12:55.135
Peter Nielsen.

13:00.635 --> 13:03.301
I have connections.
I can ask around.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.260
A man does not simply disappear.

14:33.385 --> 14:34.968
Karoline Nielsen.

14:37.635 --> 14:40.010
I hope you don't mind meeting here?

14:40.760 --> 14:43.218
Fresh air clears the mind.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.593
I haven't been able to find
any information about your husband.

14:51.926 --> 14:54.385
He's not on the list
of the fallen soldiers, but...

14:56.426 --> 14:57.968
that doesn't mean a lot.

15:02.301 --> 15:03.510
I'm sorry.

15:07.593 --> 15:09.218
Shall we go for a walk?

15:22.593 --> 15:24.260
I, too, dreamt of signing up.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.010
Of course,
my position does not allow for it.

15:29.093 --> 15:33.801
I do what I can from here.
The uniforms we produce, for instance.

15:39.385 --> 15:41.426
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

15:42.426 --> 15:43.843
Chestnuts.

15:45.718 --> 15:47.426
May I treat you?

15:57.968 --> 15:59.260
Do you like it?

16:13.135 --> 16:15.426
If you need a shoulder to lean on,

16:17.801 --> 16:19.135
I'm at your service.

16:25.676 --> 16:27.010
Have a nice day.

19:02.260 --> 19:06.176
Extra, extra!
On the eleventh hour, of the eleventh day!

19:06.676 --> 19:10.426
Buy it here!
The war is over! Germany surrenders!

19:10.593 --> 19:13.718
Buy it here!
Read all about it!

19:14.426 --> 19:15.718
Thanks.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.760
<i>Dear workers
at the Kitzler Sewing Factory.</i>

19:19.385 --> 19:21.385
The war in Europe is over

19:21.885 --> 19:25.093
and hopefully,
a brighter future is ahead of us.

19:27.260 --> 19:30.301
Even if we didn't participate in the war

19:30.547 --> 19:32.755
it has caused suffering
beyond description.

19:34.343 --> 19:36.968
I'll ask you to join me
in a moment of silence.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.301
To say a prayer for the fallen.

19:42.010 --> 19:43.260
Everyone included.

20:08.510 --> 20:09.635
Thank you.

20:11.093 --> 20:14.926
We'll stop production of uniforms
and return to the soft linen

20:15.093 --> 20:18.010
that has been my family's signature
for generations.

20:19.385 --> 20:23.801
I expect that fewer needles breaking
will make a pleasant change.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.760
Please join me in a toast.

21:19.260 --> 21:21.801
Merry Christmas.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.301
There we are.

22:02.260 --> 22:03.885
You are beautiful.

22:05.093 --> 22:06.885
Thank you.

22:15.843 --> 22:17.593
I can't believe you're mine.

22:44.051 --> 22:46.260
Karoline!

22:56.343 --> 22:57.551
Wait!

22:59.135 --> 23:00.260
Karoline!

23:18.843 --> 23:20.468
What do you want?

23:21.176 --> 23:24.093
Who are you?
What do you want? Take that off.

23:45.593 --> 23:48.301
Karoline? Who's that?

23:51.301 --> 23:52.635
My friend.

23:53.385 --> 23:56.135
- Have you lost your job, Karoline?
- No.

23:57.260 --> 24:00.801
Why do you then have "friends" to visit?

24:04.343 --> 24:06.093
I'm her husband.

24:22.510 --> 24:25.010
I went to our apartment.
Other people live there now.

24:36.968 --> 24:38.510
Where have you been?

24:41.593 --> 24:43.176
I was wounded.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.510
I wrote you letters.

24:55.135 --> 24:56.801
Did you get them?

24:58.051 --> 24:59.093
Yes.

25:01.218 --> 25:04.843
Why didn't you write me back?
It's been a year.

25:06.218 --> 25:07.635
Yes.

25:10.843 --> 25:11.843
I'm sorry.

26:03.635 --> 26:05.218
Sorry.

26:22.801 --> 26:25.468
- Peter.
- Yes?

26:33.093 --> 26:34.468
I've met someone else.

26:38.843 --> 26:40.676
And I'm pregnant.

26:42.593 --> 26:46.010
I thought you were dead.
You made me believe that.

26:50.010 --> 26:51.426
I have a new life.

27:00.093 --> 27:01.176
You are my wife.

27:07.218 --> 27:08.343
Go.

27:12.176 --> 27:15.093
You need to go.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.218
Off you go!

27:21.635 --> 27:24.634
Leave this place now!

27:24.635 --> 27:27.301
Goodbye!

27:55.051 --> 27:56.801
What's going on?

27:58.385 --> 28:01.343
I'm sorry, sir,
this young lady won't listen.

28:02.051 --> 28:07.051
- I have asked her to leave.
- Thank you. I'll see her briefly.

28:11.718 --> 28:12.801
What's going on?

28:21.426 --> 28:23.343
Say you will marry me.

28:27.426 --> 28:28.551
Say it.

28:30.843 --> 28:31.968
Say it.

28:36.135 --> 28:37.218
Yes.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.926
Yes, I'll marry you.

29:08.135 --> 29:09.843
You are brave.

29:16.218 --> 29:17.760
When I get a house...

29:20.176 --> 29:21.885
I'm taking you with me.

29:24.301 --> 29:25.968
What will I do?

29:28.593 --> 29:33.093
Whatever you want.
You could be in charge of the maids.

29:34.593 --> 29:37.801
- Does that make me a maid?
- No, silly.

29:38.426 --> 29:43.010
In charge of the maids.
You will have your own maid.

30:15.385 --> 30:18.342
- Good day.
- Good day, may I take your coats?

30:18.343 --> 30:19.760
Yes, thank you.

30:33.718 --> 30:36.426
Is this the young lady?

30:37.510 --> 30:38.676
Yes.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.885
So good of you to come.
I'm pleased to finally meet you.

30:48.885 --> 30:50.926
My honour, Miss... Madame...

30:53.510 --> 30:55.343
Please, come with me.

30:59.635 --> 31:02.343
This is just between us ladies.

31:43.593 --> 31:45.092
Get undressed.

31:45.093 --> 31:47.176
For the doctor to examine you.

31:48.385 --> 31:53.468
Anyone can tell my son
that they are pregnant, don't you agree?

31:54.551 --> 31:55.676
Yes.

32:01.926 --> 32:03.676
Undergarments only.

32:06.260 --> 32:08.176
You must know how it works.

32:33.135 --> 32:34.260
Yes.

32:39.718 --> 32:41.343
It'll be over in a minute.

32:57.676 --> 32:58.843
Yes.

33:00.176 --> 33:02.176
You can get dressed now.

33:11.051 --> 33:13.926
Yes. She's pregnant.

33:23.093 --> 33:26.093
- Can it be taken care of?
- It's too late, I'm afraid.

33:29.676 --> 33:32.426
- Good day, Madam Baroness.
- Good day, Doctor.

33:37.551 --> 33:41.801
My son shall never marry you.

33:42.885 --> 33:44.801
Can Jørgen join us now?

33:46.301 --> 33:47.301
Thank you.

33:47.635 --> 33:48.926
Get him.

33:57.968 --> 33:59.218
Yes, Mother?

34:02.593 --> 34:06.260
The young lady is of the impression,
you two are to be married?

34:08.093 --> 34:09.676
We have discussed it, yes.

34:10.926 --> 34:13.343
Jørgen is free to do as he wishes.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.468
Not with my money, not in this house

34:18.718 --> 34:20.718
but as he wishes.

34:33.301 --> 34:34.301
Perhaps...

34:36.635 --> 34:38.385
Did you say something, son?

34:44.293 --> 34:46.114
Perhaps we have rushed things.

34:52.510 --> 34:55.010
- Please forgive me.
- Jørgen?

34:59.968 --> 35:02.176
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

35:13.010 --> 35:14.635
What's going on?

35:19.843 --> 35:21.468
Give him a handkerchief.

35:26.093 --> 35:27.385
Thank you.

35:30.343 --> 35:32.676
Would you please leave us now?

35:36.176 --> 35:39.176
Furthermore, your services
at the factory are no longer needed.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.343
Please leave now.

35:46.801 --> 35:48.176
I'm sorry.

36:00.676 --> 36:02.093
Your coat.

36:23.135 --> 36:24.760
It's regrettable.

36:39.468 --> 36:41.093
It's occupied.

39:22.301 --> 39:23.343
What are you doing?

39:25.926 --> 39:27.468
Come on.

39:35.093 --> 39:36.301
Sit down here.

39:37.676 --> 39:40.093
- Erena, hand me your towel.
- Yes.

39:41.885 --> 39:43.718
Press.

39:49.801 --> 39:52.801
- What's going on here?
- She just slipped.

39:53.417 --> 39:58.417
- We don't like people slipping in here.
- I'll take care of her.

40:14.801 --> 40:18.051
If the bleeding doesn't stop,
you must see a doctor immediately.

40:20.135 --> 40:24.218
- We will escort you home.
- Thanks, I'm fine.

40:24.635 --> 40:29.426
You don't stick a needle in yourself,
if you're fine. We'll take you home.

40:30.218 --> 40:31.968
I said I'm fine.

40:36.926 --> 40:38.635
There is another way.

40:40.135 --> 40:42.426
I can help you find a foster family.

40:45.260 --> 40:49.926
Some women can't have children,
others have more than they wished for.

40:51.093 --> 40:53.260
It makes sense that we help each other.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.510
I'm going this way.

41:02.385 --> 41:04.385
Come and visit me when the baby is born.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.968
Don't give it a name.
It's easier that way.

41:09.676 --> 41:12.968
- Why would you help me?
- Who else would?

41:14.551 --> 41:16.551
- I charge a fee.
- Can I have one?

41:18.343 --> 41:21.510
Behave yourself. You.

41:23.093 --> 41:24.968
- It's all right.
- Here.

41:25.926 --> 41:28.135
Keep an eye on the bleeding.
It's no joke.

41:30.010 --> 41:32.051
- Goodbye. Come along.
- See you.

41:36.885 --> 41:38.510
Mind the hole, jump.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.958
Karoline?

41:52.635 --> 41:53.801
Have you lost your job?

41:55.135 --> 41:57.468
A man came by with this.

42:02.885 --> 42:04.718
I took what you owed me.

42:22.135 --> 42:26.385
Listen up all of you!
I only need 20 today.

42:26.843 --> 42:32.010
I need the strongest ones.
Those who can do the job.

42:40.135 --> 42:43.010
Stop, that's enough.

42:44.885 --> 42:47.301
Get out.

43:01.010 --> 43:03.218
- Watch out.
- Hey!

43:21.968 --> 43:23.968
Come now.

43:37.343 --> 43:40.426
Come now.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.801
Nancy and Claude!

43:56.635 --> 43:58.385
Honoured guests.

43:59.301 --> 44:02.468
Ladies and gentlemen.

44:03.551 --> 44:08.010
Did anyone here participate
in The Great War?

44:09.260 --> 44:13.635
No, no, no...
No? Nor you, no?

44:14.260 --> 44:19.093
That's what I thought.
While you sat at home, safe and secure,

44:19.551 --> 44:24.426
reading the newspaper with a little beer.

44:28.010 --> 44:33.260
Some unfortunate souls were there.
On the battleground.

44:36.010 --> 44:37.718
Ladies and gentlemen.

44:38.135 --> 44:42.676
Allow me to introduce you to a sensation.

44:45.426 --> 44:50.010
This is what the war spat out. March.

45:03.676 --> 45:04.885
Freak!

45:12.551 --> 45:15.551
Ladies and gentlemen. Take a good look.

45:16.718 --> 45:21.260
Look straight at
what the papers did not write about.

45:21.926 --> 45:27.260
Look into the face of pain.

45:40.843 --> 45:42.843
Monster!

45:43.926 --> 45:48.635
Ladies and gentlemen.
Does anyone of you dare to touch him?

45:52.010 --> 45:54.010
No one fancies touching the poor freak?

45:56.260 --> 45:57.843
He won't bite.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.051
Well.

46:04.510 --> 46:08.593
Right at the back
we have a brave young lady.

46:09.135 --> 46:11.385
Come closer.

46:11.801 --> 46:14.010
Come closer.
Let us give her a hand.

46:15.593 --> 46:16.968
Well done.

46:18.468 --> 46:19.843
Come up to me.

46:22.676 --> 46:25.135
Please.

46:32.135 --> 46:33.593
The hole, Peter.

46:57.010 --> 46:59.593
Well, well, well...

47:01.426 --> 47:03.926
A little kiss, perhaps?

47:06.718 --> 47:10.010
This pitiful animal probably
can't remember what a kiss feels like.

48:18.176 --> 48:20.551
It's only a nightmare.

48:24.551 --> 48:27.926
Calm down.

48:37.426 --> 48:39.801
Let go!

48:49.385 --> 48:52.010
- Karoline?
- Just a moment.

48:52.176 --> 48:55.718
- What's going on?
- Just a moment.

48:55.885 --> 48:57.010
Open this door!

48:59.843 --> 49:01.468
Karoline.

49:03.385 --> 49:06.218
- Karoline, open the door.
- Shut up!

49:08.676 --> 49:11.093
This is not a madhouse, Karoline.

49:14.010 --> 49:17.176
If he doesn't stop, I'll throw you out.

49:20.968 --> 49:22.843
I'm sorry.

49:28.635 --> 49:29.968
What happened?

49:38.385 --> 49:39.676
What is that?

49:41.801 --> 49:43.176
Morphine.

49:44.593 --> 49:46.510
It helps me calm down.

50:22.010 --> 50:23.843
Go back to sleep, Karoline.

50:40.385 --> 50:41.801
I'm sorry.

51:36.093 --> 51:40.260
- What's happening?
- The bucket...

51:40.426 --> 51:42.343
Sit down.

51:43.760 --> 51:49.176
Let me see. Let me see.

51:52.718 --> 51:56.051
- We need to get the pants off.
- What's going on?

51:56.218 --> 51:58.968
What do you think? She's in labour.

51:59.135 --> 52:02.843
- Get her to the hospital then.
- Will you take her yourself?

52:05.885 --> 52:09.842
Don't just stand there.
Get me some towels and water.

52:09.843 --> 52:12.760
- Find some towels.
- Idiots!

52:13.551 --> 52:16.385
Yes. Good.

52:16.551 --> 52:20.593
It's almost there. Look at me.
Come on. Push, push.

52:26.176 --> 52:29.301
Next time, push hard.
You will scream it out.

52:29.468 --> 52:33.801
Use all your strength.
There's only one way out.

52:33.968 --> 52:37.843
Do you understand? Look at me!

52:38.885 --> 52:40.885
Now push. Push.

52:59.260 --> 53:01.885
- Boy or girl?
- Girl.

53:05.051 --> 53:06.760
Can I hold her?

53:08.968 --> 53:10.218
Yes.

53:26.135 --> 53:29.426
So beautiful.
You are so beautiful.

53:31.051 --> 53:32.718
You could be called Susie.

53:37.426 --> 53:39.260
But she's not yours.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.593
I don't mind.

53:42.885 --> 53:44.885
We could have another child.

53:47.885 --> 53:49.426
I don't function.

53:54.843 --> 53:56.426
I don't want to keep her.

54:07.551 --> 54:08.718
Come.

54:10.010 --> 54:11.676
Come sit with us.

54:25.093 --> 54:29.093
This is a gift.
It's not something you give away.

57:20.176 --> 57:21.426
Who is it?

57:22.801 --> 57:24.093
It's for you.

57:31.010 --> 57:35.801
- Who are you?
- Karoline. We met at the baths.

57:39.426 --> 57:40.843
Come inside and close the door.

57:54.551 --> 57:57.551
- Is that your baby?
- Yes.

57:58.010 --> 57:59.218
Can I see?

58:00.510 --> 58:01.635
Yes.

58:04.843 --> 58:06.468
Boy or girl?

58:08.176 --> 58:10.343
- It's a girl.
- She's cute.

58:14.885 --> 58:17.301
And who is this little darling?

58:20.385 --> 58:23.301
- I didn't name her.
- That was wise.

58:25.010 --> 58:26.426
Do you have the money?

58:27.426 --> 58:28.510
Yes.

58:31.010 --> 58:32.593
Here you go.

58:33.801 --> 58:35.843
This is not a charity, dear.

58:37.635 --> 58:39.801
I'll bring the rest tomorrow.

58:42.176 --> 58:43.593
I remember you now.

58:45.968 --> 58:47.801
The girl with the needle.

58:48.343 --> 58:49.510
Yes.

58:50.926 --> 58:52.926
- When did you give birth?
- Yesterday.

58:58.010 --> 59:00.926
- Have you fed her today?
- No.

59:01.135 --> 59:02.135
Then feed her now.

59:07.551 --> 59:11.176
- Here's the tea.
- Thank you.

59:19.885 --> 59:21.635
Any complications during birth?

59:24.385 --> 59:25.760
I don't think so.

59:28.885 --> 59:30.968
A baby girl born...

59:31.968 --> 59:33.510
What's today's date?

59:35.051 --> 59:36.135
I don't know.

59:36.885 --> 59:39.426
Erena, will you fetch
the paper from Mrs Andersen?

59:45.510 --> 59:47.718
Do you know who will get my baby?

59:49.301 --> 59:51.301
Some good people.

59:53.718 --> 59:59.260
Doctors, lawyers. People
who can afford to do good for others.

01:00:02.218 --> 01:00:04.468
She'll be fine.
You're doing the right thing.

01:00:07.926 --> 01:00:09.593
That's good.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.885
- She had just finished with it.
- That's good.

01:00:19.968 --> 01:00:22.968
Born 12th of August-- No.

01:00:23.801 --> 01:00:26.218
I wrote today.
You gave birth yesterday.

01:00:27.676 --> 01:00:29.260
Well...

01:00:30.843 --> 01:00:34.135
Arms up. As tight as you can.

01:00:35.593 --> 01:00:38.343
Eventually you will stop lactating.

01:00:42.718 --> 01:00:43.843
There.

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:50.885
All set.

01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:01.551
You owe me money.

01:01:04.301 --> 01:01:05.343
Yes.

01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:14.135
- Should I say goodbye?
- It's easier if you don't.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.843
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

01:01:33.176 --> 01:01:35.176
<i>Karoline, where's your baby?</i>

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.718
<i>I gave it away.</i>

01:01:40.135 --> 01:01:41.760
To whom?

01:01:42.968 --> 01:01:45.426
A lady is helping me find a foster family.

01:01:53.635 --> 01:01:55.635
- Didn't you want it?
- No.

01:01:58.635 --> 01:02:00.426
Of course I didn't want it.

01:02:13.926 --> 01:02:16.176
I think the little one needs a feed.

01:02:22.218 --> 01:02:25.635
Up to mum, little darling.

01:02:26.051 --> 01:02:28.093
Would you like something to eat?

01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:22.135
What do you want?

01:03:23.176 --> 01:03:24.385
Do you have the money?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.542
- No.
- Then, what are you doing here?

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.676
- I thought I could feed her.
- Feed her?

01:03:34.551 --> 01:03:37.551
- Your baby is not here anymore.
- Where is she?

01:03:39.176 --> 01:03:41.593
I passed her on.
These matters can't wait.

01:03:58.926 --> 01:04:03.009
- Do you need anything?
- There is a blanket under the counter.

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:04.792
- Get it for me.
- Yes.

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:24.926
- Should I get help?
- No, no. It will pass.

01:04:26.926 --> 01:04:28.771
- We are closed.
- The sign says open.

01:04:28.772 --> 01:04:31.099
- I said closed!
- Calm down.

01:04:42.343 --> 01:04:46.843
- Take some sweets home with you.
- I would like to work for you.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:52.510
I have milk. I can feed the babies
while they wait for their new families.

01:04:59.093 --> 01:05:00.260
Right.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.593
It's better than a cow's milk.

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:13.260
Your milk will run short.

01:05:13.926 --> 01:05:15.801
Not if I milk myself.

01:05:16.843 --> 01:05:21.551
My mother did it, she sold her milk.
Then I can pay what I owe you.

01:05:23.718 --> 01:05:26.135
It is money you owe me, not milk.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.593
I don't have any money.

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.426
I have nowhere to go.

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:49.676
Erena! Come here.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.510
Don't be prudish.

01:06:00.468 --> 01:06:02.468
It's healthy for her.

01:06:05.176 --> 01:06:07.801
Besides, milking by hand takes forever.

01:07:09.051 --> 01:07:10.885
Mum, she smells.

01:07:11.593 --> 01:07:13.426
Well then, let's take a bath.

01:07:31.843 --> 01:07:33.010
What about me?

01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:08.885
- Dagmar?
- I'm coming.

01:08:12.426 --> 01:08:14.426
Good night.

01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:35.885
Mum says it's time.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.885
Fits you well.

01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:29.676
What is that?

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:34.260
Sometimes they get so emotional.

01:09:35.176 --> 01:09:39.301
- This helps me stay calm.
- Is it morphine?

01:09:39.885 --> 01:09:43.385
No, it's ether. Do you want to try?

01:09:50.343 --> 01:09:51.760
Thank you.

01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:36.551
Get up.

01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:39.176
Come on.

01:11:33.093 --> 01:11:34.385
You're doing the right thing.

01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:50.426
- Should we examine him?
- There's no point with this one.

01:11:50.593 --> 01:11:53.801
- Why not?
- Nobody will want him.

01:11:56.593 --> 01:11:58.593
We'll have to give him to an orphanage.

01:12:43.968 --> 01:12:45.426
Are you done?

01:12:56.426 --> 01:12:57.679
I thought you were Dagmar.

01:13:10.301 --> 01:13:11.718
What're you doing here?

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:17.760
Do you know it's illegal
to buy and sell babies?

01:13:19.385 --> 01:13:21.385
- But you are here.
- Yes.

01:13:22.885 --> 01:13:24.885
I'm just someone who drops by.

01:13:27.551 --> 01:13:29.385
But you work here.

01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:06.010
Sometimes I feel so lonely.

01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:10.051
I'm here.

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:18.885
Many lives pass through this apartment.

01:14:21.593 --> 01:14:23.343
It leaves a trace.

01:14:26.635 --> 01:14:28.260
Sometimes I regret what I did.

01:14:29.843 --> 01:14:32.593
Dear, now you get emotional.

01:14:37.301 --> 01:14:39.135
Let's do something fun today.

01:15:32.718 --> 01:15:34.218
Quiet.

01:16:07.093 --> 01:16:09.093
Who's the man you're seeing?

01:16:10.468 --> 01:16:12.301
Svendsen?

01:16:14.551 --> 01:16:16.593
- Is he Erena's father?
- No.

01:16:17.801 --> 01:16:19.801
He's just a man I have fun with.

01:16:22.551 --> 01:16:24.551
I don't like the way he looks at me.

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:29.551
- How is that?
- I suspect he wants to have fun with me.

01:16:35.718 --> 01:16:40.176
<i>Today it is Erena's birthday
Hurray, hurray, hurray!</i>

01:16:40.593 --> 01:16:46.426
<i>She probably recieves a present
that she has wished for this year</i>

01:16:46.593 --> 01:16:50.260
<i>with lovely chocolate and cakes</i>

01:16:50.593 --> 01:16:52.426
You can blow now.

01:16:54.093 --> 01:16:56.551
The last one.

01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.593
It's magic.

01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:20.051
You're leaking.

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:26.801
- Have you fed Erena today?
- I must have forgotten.

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.260
Then do it now.

01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:46.010
I don't want you to come anymore.

01:17:47.093 --> 01:17:48.301
Why not?

01:17:50.093 --> 01:17:51.718
I don't need you.

01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:07.301
You will miss me.

01:18:10.843 --> 01:18:12.260
Don't.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.176
Get out.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.135
She's not like you.

01:19:07.218 --> 01:19:10.801
Salmi... salt liquorice.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.843
"Kongen af Danmark". No, bergamot drops.

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.260
Nougat...

01:19:23.542 --> 01:19:25.542
Liquorice...

01:19:26.593 --> 01:19:28.593
Nougat.

01:19:29.926 --> 01:19:31.676
Hello.

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:34.968
Can I help you?

01:19:35.801 --> 01:19:37.843
I was told to come here.

01:19:45.218 --> 01:19:47.218
Is it about the baby?

01:20:01.885 --> 01:20:03.510
What should I do?

01:20:04.468 --> 01:20:06.301
You have to feed it.

01:20:07.093 --> 01:20:09.176
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:20:09.718 --> 01:20:12.176
- It's not mine.
- Then whose is it?

01:20:13.093 --> 01:20:14.760
My mother's.

01:20:15.593 --> 01:20:17.260
Please, will you take him?

01:20:31.051 --> 01:20:32.760
Is this right?

01:20:36.426 --> 01:20:39.051
Yes. I'll take him.

01:20:44.885 --> 01:20:46.676
It's locked.

01:20:50.426 --> 01:20:52.218
Let me help you.

01:21:03.676 --> 01:21:05.301
You've done the right thing.

01:21:13.885 --> 01:21:17.926
You've done a good deed.
You helped when no one else would.

01:21:24.093 --> 01:21:25.926
You can keep the child.

01:21:26.593 --> 01:21:28.843
Until we find a family good enough.

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:31.926
Thank you.

01:21:41.676 --> 01:21:49.218
It's most important to have
the right footwear when we go for a walk.

01:21:53.801 --> 01:21:55.635
What do you think of these?

01:21:56.593 --> 01:21:58.093
Do you like them?

01:22:02.176 --> 01:22:03.218
This one...

01:22:04.718 --> 01:22:07.801
This... is beautiful.

01:22:09.218 --> 01:22:10.218
Don't you think?

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.718
His mother made her daughter
give him to Dagmar and me.

01:22:17.676 --> 01:22:19.343
She could not do it herself.

01:22:21.301 --> 01:22:22.760
I think that's weak.

01:22:25.926 --> 01:22:28.551
I'll care for him until we find a family
that's good enough.

01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:33.635
- Dagmar also helped you?
- Yes.

01:22:37.468 --> 01:22:39.926
- Who will take him?
- Good people.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.176
Perhaps doctors, lawyers.

01:22:45.343 --> 01:22:47.176
People who can afford to do good.

01:22:49.176 --> 01:22:51.176
- Did they also get your baby?
- Yes.

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.551
I think he woke up.

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:08.551
Karoline.

01:24:09.968 --> 01:24:11.635
Can I sleep here with you?

01:24:12.968 --> 01:24:14.093
No.

01:24:24.010 --> 01:24:26.343
Can I have some milk to make me sleep?

01:24:28.426 --> 01:24:31.385
No. Go to bed.

01:24:32.010 --> 01:24:33.010
Why?

01:24:33.135 --> 01:24:35.593
I don't do that anymore. Go to bed.

01:25:12.676 --> 01:25:16.426
Why would you do something like that?

01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:58.968
What are you doing?

01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:01.885
I've found a family.

01:26:02.385 --> 01:26:04.218
- Already?
- Yes.

01:26:06.093 --> 01:26:08.551
- Who are they?
- I can't tell you.

01:26:09.343 --> 01:26:12.093
- I want to know.
- They don't want you to know.

01:26:16.551 --> 01:26:20.010
You can't be here if you are
this emotional. This is a business.

01:26:25.968 --> 01:26:27.801
Is it because I slapped Erena?

01:26:29.593 --> 01:26:30.801
Is it?

01:26:31.551 --> 01:26:33.885
Is that why you're taking him?

01:26:34.926 --> 01:26:38.135
You told me to take care of him.
You said that.

01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:41.093
- So why do you just take him?
- Enough!

01:26:43.426 --> 01:26:45.260
- You can't just tell me--
- Shh!

01:27:28.593 --> 01:27:29.801
Thank you.

01:29:37.968 --> 01:29:39.385
Where were you?

01:29:42.135 --> 01:29:44.968
You left the store open.
Anyone could have walked in.

01:29:48.135 --> 01:29:49.343
Karoline!

01:29:59.135 --> 01:30:00.801
Are you not feeling well?

01:30:14.343 --> 01:30:16.051
You're shivering.

01:30:26.968 --> 01:30:28.385
Karoline.

01:30:39.301 --> 01:30:40.510
Where is my baby?

01:30:42.385 --> 01:30:44.385
- Your baby is with her family.
- Liar!

01:30:51.468 --> 01:30:54.635
- Where is she?
- Your baby is with her family.

01:30:55.218 --> 01:30:58.218
Murderer! You killed her.

01:31:06.051 --> 01:31:07.468
You did kill her?

01:31:15.176 --> 01:31:16.385
Why?

01:31:17.051 --> 01:31:19.051
There, there.

01:31:24.051 --> 01:31:25.385
I know it hurts.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.593
The world is a horrible place.

01:31:32.801 --> 01:31:34.885
But we need to believe it's not so.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.458
Do you understand?

01:31:40.474 --> 01:31:41.682
No.

01:31:57.385 --> 01:31:58.968
Have some drops.

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.885
It will take the pain away.
Come on.

01:32:06.593 --> 01:32:07.635
Let me help you.

01:32:09.843 --> 01:32:12.635
Come here. Drink. Drink!

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.510
Come on.

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.176
Good girl.

01:32:23.625 --> 01:32:26.667
Take care of Erena. You're good for her.

01:32:28.635 --> 01:32:29.885
I don't want her.

01:33:58.885 --> 01:34:00.301
<i>Karoline.</i>

01:34:19.801 --> 01:34:22.801
<i>Karoline, come to me.</i>

01:34:36.885 --> 01:34:38.468
I've made you some soup.

01:34:39.343 --> 01:34:41.135
You have to eat something.

01:34:43.343 --> 01:34:44.760
Karoline, come on.

01:34:50.635 --> 01:34:54.510
- Drops.
- There's none left. The bottle is empty.

01:34:55.593 --> 01:34:57.010
Eat something.

01:35:04.051 --> 01:35:05.551
You can have some naphtha.

01:35:12.343 --> 01:35:13.676
Come now.

01:35:30.135 --> 01:35:31.510
Deep breaths.

01:35:39.718 --> 01:35:40.968
Again.

01:35:43.468 --> 01:35:44.468
Last time.

01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:02.635
You can have a rest, but soon
we will have to get back to normal.

01:36:22.051 --> 01:36:24.051
<i>You've done the right thing.</i>

01:36:29.385 --> 01:36:31.385
<i>It will take the pain away.</i>

01:36:39.051 --> 01:36:41.051
Tell me something about yourself.

01:36:42.093 --> 01:36:43.926
I don't know anything about you.

01:36:46.385 --> 01:36:49.718
Are you from the city?

01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:55.385
Or from the countryside?
That's where I'm from.

01:36:57.968 --> 01:36:59.510
I used to milk cows.

01:37:14.593 --> 01:37:16.676
I was alone
when I gave birth for the first time.

01:37:19.176 --> 01:37:21.176
I bit off the umbilical cord
with my teeth.

01:37:25.051 --> 01:37:26.926
The others were stillborn.

01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:32.593
All five of them.

01:37:45.343 --> 01:37:46.551
I'm cold.

01:37:51.593 --> 01:37:52.843
I think it's cold.

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.010
It's cold.

01:38:55.093 --> 01:38:57.926
- Do you want some tea?
- No, thank you.

01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:18.510
Would you like to feed her one last time?

01:39:19.593 --> 01:39:21.676
No, I would like to leave now.

01:39:23.468 --> 01:39:26.176
Frida? I want to leave now.

01:39:26.635 --> 01:39:29.301
Let me follow you out.

01:39:42.593 --> 01:39:44.968
- Goodbye.
- Is Karoline here?

01:39:46.176 --> 01:39:49.718
No. You've done the right thing.

01:40:16.301 --> 01:40:18.135
Do you want to do it this time?

01:40:22.968 --> 01:40:25.385
It's easy. Just squeeze tight.

01:40:26.676 --> 01:40:27.885
No.

01:40:38.218 --> 01:40:40.635
Just squeeze hard,
like you never want to let her go.

01:40:47.343 --> 01:40:48.468
Come on.

01:40:49.718 --> 01:40:51.885
No, I don't want to.

01:41:56.218 --> 01:41:57.468
Mrs Overby?

01:41:58.926 --> 01:42:00.468
Please, open the door.

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.166
We have changed our minds.

01:42:10.173 --> 01:42:12.048
We want the baby back.

01:42:19.343 --> 01:42:22.885
Karoline! Are you in there?

01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:26.510
Open the door.

01:42:29.635 --> 01:42:31.968
I'll get the police,
if you don't open the door.

01:42:32.584 --> 01:42:34.168
Do you hear me?

01:43:07.343 --> 01:43:09.176
A woman got the child.

01:43:11.593 --> 01:43:13.385
We don't know who she is.

01:43:18.885 --> 01:43:20.885
She's from the countryside and...

01:43:24.468 --> 01:43:27.593
we don't know her name.
She has gone back already.

01:43:33.676 --> 01:43:36.510
We just need to look our best.

01:43:37.176 --> 01:43:38.593
Get dressed.

01:43:45.843 --> 01:43:47.176
Get dressed.

01:43:52.385 --> 01:43:53.718
Get dressed!

01:43:57.260 --> 01:43:58.676
Put this on.

01:43:59.801 --> 01:44:01.426
Erena.

01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:23.051
What are you doing?

01:44:32.718 --> 01:44:34.343
What are you doing?

01:44:37.176 --> 01:44:38.718
Please come down.

01:44:39.426 --> 01:44:42.051
Dagmar Overby,
this is the police, open up!

01:44:43.468 --> 01:44:45.968
- Stay with me.
- Please come down.

01:44:47.385 --> 01:44:49.301
You have nowhere to go. Stay.

01:44:50.718 --> 01:44:52.718
Open this door or we will break it down.

01:45:07.718 --> 01:45:08.968
Dagmar Overby?

01:45:17.593 --> 01:45:19.218
- Yes.
- Grab her.

01:45:20.676 --> 01:45:22.051
Please come with us.

01:45:24.176 --> 01:45:25.301
Yes.

01:45:28.718 --> 01:45:33.260
- Erena needs to come with me.
- We'll take care of her.

01:45:33.551 --> 01:45:37.343
- We'll take care of her. Come.
- Erena.

01:46:01.718 --> 01:46:06.510
Well done. Great. Balance, balance.

01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:06.260
Cheers!

01:48:36.885 --> 01:48:39.198
BABY KILLER CAUGHT

01:48:44.176 --> 01:48:46.176
We are travelling south soon.

01:48:47.301 --> 01:48:49.760
And we have agreed you can come,
if you want to?

01:48:52.385 --> 01:48:53.635
Thank you.

01:49:05.176 --> 01:49:07.010
What did you do with your baby?

01:49:12.051 --> 01:49:13.426
I gave it away.

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.260
It's probably for the best.

01:49:37.926 --> 01:49:39.760
Do you have your medicine?

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:45.385
You'll manage without.

01:49:57.926 --> 01:49:59.135
Come.

01:50:35.843 --> 01:50:37.926
<i>How did you kill Mrs Andersen's baby?</i>

01:50:39.468 --> 01:50:40.676
<i>I don't remember.</i>

01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:44.426
<i>What did you do with
the body of Mrs Andersen's baby?</i>

01:50:45.718 --> 01:50:50.551
<i>I don't remember. Maybe I burnt it.
Maybe I put it in the lavatory.</i>

01:50:51.468 --> 01:50:54.510
<i>Maybe in November, maybe March.
There were so many.</i>

01:50:57.676 --> 01:51:00.967
<i>The notebook found
in your apartment mentions</i>

01:51:00.968 --> 01:51:04.468
<i>35 meetings with women and their babies.</i>

01:51:05.593 --> 01:51:08.426
<i>- Did you kill them all?
- Where is my baby?</i>

01:51:08.926 --> 01:51:11.885
<i>I want my baby back. You nasty pig!</i>

01:51:12.676 --> 01:51:14.676
<i>Burn in hell!</i>

01:51:14.968 --> 01:51:16.635
<i>Let me go.</i>

01:51:16.801 --> 01:51:22.135
<i>Was anyone else aware of
what you did with the babies?</i>

01:51:22.968 --> 01:51:23.968
<i>No.</i>

01:51:25.385 --> 01:51:26.426
How about

01:51:27.926 --> 01:51:31.093
your so-called daughter, Erena.

01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.676
Did she know?

01:51:35.593 --> 01:51:36.718
No.

01:51:38.135 --> 01:51:42.426
Is there any proof that the girl
you call your daughter is your daughter?

01:51:45.135 --> 01:51:46.260
My word.

01:51:49.635 --> 01:51:52.635
In the opinion of doctors,
you are too old to be her mother.

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:56.093
Your penis is old too.

01:52:03.718 --> 01:52:09.010
- Where is she?
- I'm sure she is fine at the orphanage.

01:52:11.468 --> 01:52:15.385
Let me see her.
Then, I'll give you four more bodies.

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:19.635
- Four more?
- Yes, four more. If not five.

01:52:24.301 --> 01:52:26.926
I put one in the lavatory on Prinsgade.

01:52:30.676 --> 01:52:35.926
And I... I took one
with me in my bag when I went to...

01:52:36.676 --> 01:52:38.426
Why, Mrs Overby?

01:52:39.426 --> 01:52:41.051
Why did you kill them?

01:52:43.176 --> 01:52:44.801
That's what was needed.

01:52:46.051 --> 01:52:47.676
What do you mean?

01:52:48.135 --> 01:52:52.551
Those children had caused their mothers
lots of suffering. I helped them!

01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:57.510
I doubt a mother wants her child killed.

01:52:58.885 --> 01:53:00.718
What else were they supposed to do?

01:53:01.593 --> 01:53:05.801
You promised them a better life.
A loving foster family.

01:53:07.051 --> 01:53:10.760
Do you believe in that?
Just look around.

01:53:12.051 --> 01:53:15.509
Nobody believes that their shameful infant

01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:21.176
will get a loving doctor as a father
or a respectable lady for a mother.

01:53:23.426 --> 01:53:25.968
I only did what was necessary.

01:53:27.801 --> 01:53:32.551
I only did what you're too scared to do.
You're too scared to admit it.

01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:36.218
In fact, you should give me a medal.

01:53:40.385 --> 01:53:42.760
Killer!

01:53:42.926 --> 01:53:45.968
- Burn in hell!
- Hang her.

01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:53.593
Guard, take her out.

01:53:54.426 --> 01:53:56.843
Kill her!

01:54:40.968 --> 01:54:44.885
Thy will be done,
as in heaven, so on earth.

01:54:45.051 --> 01:54:47.468
Give us this day our daily bread

01:54:47.635 --> 01:54:52.176
and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

01:54:52.343 --> 01:54:55.760
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:54:55.926 --> 01:55:01.718
For the kingdom, the power and the glory
are yours. Now and for ever. Amen.

01:55:01.885 --> 01:55:03.385
You may eat.

01:55:16.718 --> 01:55:19.885
It is a little unusual
to adopt a 7-year-old.

01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:23.635
Have you thought this through?

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:28.885
Yes.

01:55:29.468 --> 01:55:30.885
Are you sure?

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:35.385
Yes.

01:55:41.801 --> 01:55:44.760
I'm grateful for people like you.

01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:49.010
You give a child a second chance.
