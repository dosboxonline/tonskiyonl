WEBVTT

00:09.226 --> 00:11.141
[engine stops]

00:22.283 --> 00:24.850
It might sound extreme,
but I'm pretty sure
I'm in love.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.635
I thought you had three more
nannies to interview.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.680
I do, but Joelle walked
through the door,

00:28.724 --> 00:30.421
and Steve immediately
stopped fussing.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.467
She held him
the whole time.

00:32.509 --> 00:35.296
-Plus, she speaks Spanish.
-Bilingual bonus.

00:35.339 --> 00:38.255
Right? And it will be so much
easier to go back to work

00:38.299 --> 00:41.084
if I know Steve is happy
without me.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.347
But Shaun has reservations.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.132
There's a whole
process involving

00:45.175 --> 00:47.090
spreadsheets,
ranked voting.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.527
Screw that. Good nannies
are hard to find.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.747
You gotta pounce now.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.184
I can't just make
that decision without Shaun.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.623
Your body is no longer
tolerating the dialysis,

00:58.667 --> 01:01.017
and it is putting you
at high risk for stroke
or cardiac damage.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.846
We need to start you
on continuous renal
replacement therapy.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.979
"Continuous" meaning...?

01:07.023 --> 01:08.720
[Jordan] Your mom
has to stay here

01:08.764 --> 01:11.593
until she receives
a kidney transplant.

01:11.636 --> 01:14.551
I want you home, not living
in a hospital for years.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.293
It won't be years.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.991
CRRT is usually only effective
for about one week.

01:19.426 --> 01:21.124
And then?

01:21.994 --> 01:23.866
Complications will set in,

01:23.908 --> 01:25.476
and without a transplant,
she will--

01:25.520 --> 01:28.652
W-We're going to
find a kidney.

01:28.697 --> 01:31.003
The last two donors
weren't compatible.

01:31.047 --> 01:33.919
Suki.
Let's try to stay positive.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.965
How? The video
I posted last night

01:36.008 --> 01:38.881
asking for donors
only has a few hundred views.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.101
I don't have
enough followers.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.798
Come here, baby.

01:48.543 --> 01:51.459
You have
such a good heart.

01:55.593 --> 01:58.814
We will place a catheter
in your right jugular vein

01:58.857 --> 02:00.598
and start CRRT.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.953
Looking forward to
my internal medicine rotation

02:07.997 --> 02:09.520
with you, Dr. Reznick.
I really--

02:09.564 --> 02:11.348
Each of the urine samples
needs a dip test.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.263
Each of the stool samples
in the poop fridge

02:13.307 --> 02:14.743
needs a fecal occult
blood test.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.179
Okay. I don't know
how to--

02:16.223 --> 02:19.704
Dip the pee. Dab the poo.
Send to the lab.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.489
It's not rocket science,
MacGyver.

02:21.532 --> 02:25.014
But first, that little
blond girl, Zelda,
needs her TDAP vaccine.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.147
And be careful.
She's a biter.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.848
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.285
I saw a video post
about a patient here.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.200
Where do I go
to donate my kidney?

02:39.028 --> 02:41.639
[theme music playing]

02:49.081 --> 02:52.737
[light-hearted music plays]

02:52.781 --> 02:55.523
[crashing]

02:55.566 --> 02:58.178
I was supposed to raise
my legs and slide on my butt.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.875
Did you hear
any cracking sounds?

02:59.918 --> 03:02.356
No. I didn't realize my leg was
hurt until we were driving home

03:02.399 --> 03:04.271
and the adrenaline
wore off.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.316
Did that say
1.6 million views?

03:06.360 --> 03:08.275
Turns out that when your
tech-savvy daughter helps you

03:08.318 --> 03:11.147
with your bucket list,
you end up an influencer.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.715
You've got a Grade 4
malignant spinal cord tumor.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.282
How long
did they give you?

03:15.325 --> 03:18.589
About a year.
10 months ago.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.678
Which is why I took a break
from college.

03:20.722 --> 03:21.984
Spend as much time with him
as possible.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.333
Make videos.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.161
And memories.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.685
[Dr. Park] Let's get x-rays
and a CT of the femur.

03:27.728 --> 03:30.210
Get you back on your feet
as quick as possible.

03:30.253 --> 03:33.343
Okay, if you'll lie down,
we'll get you down
to radiology.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.040
Jerome, do you mind
just unlocking that side?

03:36.651 --> 03:37.781
Sorry. I need to leave.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.791
Yes, hi. It's Aaron Glassman
checking in on those images.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.098
Well, when... [sighs]

03:49.141 --> 03:50.839
They were supposed
to be ready today.

03:53.624 --> 03:57.889
Fine. Can you have them
call me as soon asthey come in, please?

03:57.933 --> 03:59.021
Thank you.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.114
Hi.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.159
I'm Dr. Glassman.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.379
I can just tell you
what's in there.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.688
World-stopping headaches.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.472
Over and over
for the past three years.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.560
The only thing
that helps is--

04:16.603 --> 04:18.040
Oxycodone 20s.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.434
Yeah.

04:20.476 --> 04:22.262
And then, like a total klutz,
this morning,

04:22.305 --> 04:27.005
I knocked my pill bottle
off the sink,

04:27.049 --> 04:28.050
and they all fell
into the toilet.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.138
Uh-huh.

04:31.401 --> 04:34.186
Your prescribing doctor
is unreachable,

04:34.230 --> 04:35.971
and it says here
you're drug-seeking.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.236
After three years of oxy
and a revolving door
of doctors,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.586
that doesn't surprise me.Forget it.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.719
I'll find another doctor.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.940
Like I said, total klutz.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.028
Hang on, hang on.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.423
-Sit.
-I don't have to listen to you.

04:54.468 --> 04:58.167
I know. You don't.
Please. Sit.

05:05.217 --> 05:08.395
Follow my finger.
Look to your left.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.440
All the way to the right.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.486
You have a twitch in your eye.
Did you know that?

05:13.051 --> 05:14.618
Is that a thing?

05:14.662 --> 05:16.490
It might be a thing.
Tap your finger

05:16.533 --> 05:17.795
and your thumb together.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.231
There you go.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.408
All the way to your pinky
and back.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.411
How about a partial refill?

05:24.454 --> 05:26.282
Tide me over?
Just until my doc gets back.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.111
No pills, but I am
going to order you

05:29.154 --> 05:31.722
a brain and spinal MRI.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.294
Any family history
of kidney disease?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.775
Not that I know of.
Mom's a saint,

05:40.818 --> 05:42.690
and I'm adopted
on my father's side.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.214
Under name,
you only put "Emmanuel."

05:45.257 --> 05:47.433
Yeah, that's
what people call me.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.609
Like Beyonce.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.872
-[chuckles]-Hmm. Okay.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.788
If the blood and tissue type
match with our patient,

05:53.831 --> 05:55.485
we'll do a crossmatch test
and we'll see--

05:55.529 --> 05:56.921
Yeah, we'll match.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.575
Whenever I donate, they
tell me I have golden blood.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.143
Rhnull?

06:01.186 --> 06:02.840
That's the rarest blood type
on Earth.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.668
Only 100 cases.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.366
That makes you
a universal blood donor.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.411
Birthplace just says
Nazareth.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.065
Is that in Pennsylvania?

06:10.108 --> 06:11.283
No, the other one.

06:13.677 --> 06:16.854
If the blood type tests out,
that's great news.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.682
Almost done here.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.902
Uh, you left
occupation blank.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.078
I'm a carpenter by trade,

06:23.121 --> 06:25.515
but I really consider
myself a teacher.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.474
-Dear Lord.
-Yeah, I go by
many names.

06:27.517 --> 06:29.432
Uh-huh.
This man thinks he's Jesus.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.827
I've been sent here
to help.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.096
EGFR and uACR are normal.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.272
Both kidneys are
fully functional.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.707
He is an ideal donor.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.189
Except he's obviously crazy.
He thinks he's Jesus.

06:47.232 --> 06:48.930
Technically,
we can't prove he isn't.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.759
I mean, the Bible says Jesus
will return to Earth someday.

06:51.802 --> 06:54.283
There's several examples
of ordinary people

06:54.326 --> 06:56.807
becoming holy figures
later on in life.

06:56.851 --> 06:59.375
Muhammed didn't receive
his first revelation from God

06:59.419 --> 07:00.681
till he was 40.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.727
[clears throat]
I minored in theology.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.773
He's certainly
your patient's savior.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.905
Without him,
she's dead in a week.

07:07.949 --> 07:11.213
It is possible we could find
another donor, but unlikely.

07:11.256 --> 07:14.042
but that doesn't mean
we should allow
a delusional man

07:14.085 --> 07:15.826
to make
life-altering decisions.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.915
And the surgery poses
a bigger risk for him.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.962
We can only give him blood
from another Rhnull donor,

07:21.005 --> 07:22.485
which is nearly impossible
to find.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.313
Regardless, we should
reach out to his family.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.532
Parents are dead.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.143
His emergency contact
is his landlord.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.972
If he wants to save someone's
life, I say we let him.

07:31.015 --> 07:34.845
UNOS policy says organ donation
is contraindicated

07:34.889 --> 07:36.978
if there is inability
to give informed consent

07:37.021 --> 07:39.850
due to impaired cognitive
or intellectual capacity.

07:39.894 --> 07:43.550
That's not our call.
We need a psych consult.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.073
Your patient is suffering

07:45.116 --> 07:48.250
from delusional disorder
of grandiosity.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.252
However, he can
reliably articulate

07:50.295 --> 07:51.993
that he understands
the procedure.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.473
His driver's license
indicates

07:53.516 --> 07:55.692
that he has been an organ donor
for at least a decade.

07:55.736 --> 07:59.740
That suggests this decision is
consistent with his values.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.872
He is completely competent
to donate.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.047
Hallelujah.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.140
[laughs] I don't know how
you live over half a century

08:09.184 --> 08:10.490
without trying an oyster.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.623
Well, I always wanted to.
I just... I don't know,

08:13.667 --> 08:16.278
I chickened out because
they always look so goopy.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.714
[laughs]
Well, no more fear.

08:17.758 --> 08:18.715
Slurp away.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.982
Mmm. Wow. Mmm.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.027
[cellphone beeps]

08:27.419 --> 08:28.899
Your femur's not fractured.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.075
Oh. Good.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.599
But the pain you're feeling
is called

08:32.642 --> 08:35.471
referred neuropathic pain,
from a fracture in your spine.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.168
It's compressing
your spinal cord.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.953
Not good.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.911
The tumor has infiltrated
and weakened
your spinal column.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.653
It likely fractured when you
hit the ground after skydiving.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.787
So how do we fix it?

08:46.830 --> 08:49.572
Open spinal stabilization
and fusion surgery.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.922
We replace your
fractured vertebrae with a cage

08:51.966 --> 08:54.708
and add bone grafts, screws,
and rods for support.

08:54.751 --> 08:57.667
You should be
back on your feet
in about six weeks.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.800
That could be more than half
the time we have left.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.631
There is another option
with simpler surgery.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.721
No cage and no bone grafts,
much shorter recovery time,

09:07.764 --> 09:10.332
buteven a small bump
could break it again.

09:11.507 --> 09:14.292
So I'll avoid small bumps.
Let's do it.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.425
Dad, are you sure?

09:16.468 --> 09:17.818
We have a mountain
to climb.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.562
We'll go get prepped.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.304
Come on,
get your camera rolling.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.132
I got 11 more to go.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.439
Dad, you're so old.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.528
Cameras don't roll anymore.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.269
[cell phone beeps]

09:36.140 --> 09:39.317
We still need to run an MRI
on the potential donor

09:39.361 --> 09:41.842
to evaluate
the kidney's structure.

09:41.885 --> 09:44.018
But the labs show
he could be an excellent match.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.153
Your video worked.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.199
Turns out you don't need
a million followers.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.768
Just one...
who thinks he's Jesus.

09:54.811 --> 09:55.986
[laughs softly]

09:56.030 --> 09:57.335
Hashtag blessed.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.902
[chuckles]

10:01.165 --> 10:02.210
[sighs]

10:06.083 --> 10:09.217
I would like to hire Joelle
as Steve's nanny.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.610
I worked it out.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.307
If we cut it down
to two streaming services

10:12.350 --> 10:14.439
and I stop buying Steve
so many cute outfits

10:14.483 --> 10:16.050
and we don't go on that trip
this summer,

10:16.093 --> 10:17.573
we can afford her.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.924
-Whew. This is a very
thorough spreadsheet.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:20.968 --> 10:24.493
You clearly have
strong feelings about this.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.714
We can hire Joelle.

10:27.757 --> 10:30.107
-Shaun! Yeah! [laughs]
-Okay.

10:30.151 --> 10:31.326
Okay, we should call her.

10:31.805 --> 10:32.849
Yes.

10:34.372 --> 10:35.591
[line ringing]

10:35.635 --> 10:37.027
[Joelle] Hello?

10:37.071 --> 10:39.682
Joelle, it's Lea and Shaun,
and we are so, so excited

10:39.726 --> 10:41.945
because we would love
to hire you.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.165
Oh.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.430
-You stole my nanny?
-She wasn't yournanny.

10:48.473 --> 10:51.259
Yet. And you knew
I wanted to hire her.

10:51.302 --> 10:54.218
I encouraged you
to hire her on the spot.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.915
But you hemmed you hawed
and you dilly-dallied

10:55.959 --> 10:58.179
and you spreadsheeted,
so I took action.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.268
And outbid me.
It's so gross.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.965
I told you that good nannies
are hard to find.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.837
My current one is late
half the time,

11:03.880 --> 11:05.403
and she costs more
than Joelle.

11:05.447 --> 11:08.755
I wanted to close the deal,
so I made an aggressive offer.

11:08.798 --> 11:09.973
I feel like
I don't even know you.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.935
I'm finished
with the perianal abscess.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.501
Great.
Dressing change

11:16.545 --> 11:18.634
for a diabetic foot ulcer
in 5 awaits.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.681
Nobody said wound care
was glamorous.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.773
Joelle has experience
with special-needs kids.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.252
And she's bilingual.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.515
I always wanted Eden
to be bilingual, so...

11:30.559 --> 11:33.693
seriously, thanks.

11:33.736 --> 11:37.479
You're trying to replace my
dream nanny with regifted wine?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.220
-I'm not evil.
-Debatable.

11:42.571 --> 11:43.659
[sighs]

11:44.921 --> 11:46.270
You barely even
looked at it.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.924
Enough to see there's
no tonsillar herniation,

11:47.968 --> 11:50.665
which is the main criteria
for Chiari.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.016
That's why I said
Chiari Zero.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.409
That's not
a real diagnosis.

11:54.452 --> 11:57.151
It is real.
It is controversial,
but it's real.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.109
Moderate cervical syrinx,

11:59.153 --> 12:02.722
plus occipital headaches,
plus dizziness,

12:02.765 --> 12:05.028
plus clumsiness
with the finger tapping.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.378
All symptoms
of Chiari malformation.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.989
And also symptoms
of withdrawal.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.687
Not the fluid
in her spinal cord.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.994
Too many doctors have
just fed her pain medication

12:14.037 --> 12:16.126
or shooed her away
altogether.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.345
Because she's an addict.

12:19.695 --> 12:23.525
And one who's around
your daughter's age
when she died.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.312
Wow. Okay.

12:29.574 --> 12:32.926
Hannah's pain is real.
She's in actual pain.

12:32.969 --> 12:35.406
Or she's doctor-shopping
for a sucker.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.191
Okay. So both can be true.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.323
She's not gonna be able
to get over her addiction

12:39.367 --> 12:41.978
unless somebody
addresses her pain.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.637
All right, fine.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.945
I don't know how
this is not worthwhile.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.337
Leave the images.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.399
Jerome bailed less than
an hour into his shift.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.793
I'm worried about him.

13:14.489 --> 13:15.664
He's going through it.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.102
I was thinking you might go
talk to him after work?

13:22.671 --> 13:23.846
I can't right now.

13:24.629 --> 13:25.805
Yeah, no, of course.

13:29.591 --> 13:30.897
Anything I can do for you?

13:32.289 --> 13:34.901
Thanks.
I've got an MRI.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.080
People are free to choose.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.865
God is simply aware of
what those choices will be

13:42.909 --> 13:46.216
because He lives outside
of time and space.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.696
Isaiah 57.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.654
Sorry to interrupt
your sermon.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.830
Lie back.

13:52.570 --> 13:55.573
I know we just met,
but I sense a...

13:55.617 --> 13:57.358
Like, a weight on you.

13:57.401 --> 14:00.840
A sadness.
I'm fine.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.016
I'm guessing you were close
to the young man who died.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.107
How do you know about him?

14:07.150 --> 14:09.500
[Dom] Dr. Allen,
he's tachycardic

14:09.544 --> 14:11.415
and his blood pressure's
elevated, 178 over 112.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.156
Go get 20 milligrams
labetalol.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.029
People like
to tell me things.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.204
I like to listen.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.379
So you're nosy.

14:18.422 --> 14:21.208
Mmm. I'm friendly.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.340
Um, his vitals are
normal again.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.823
Probably spiked due to anxiety,
maybe from the machine.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.260
I'm not anxious.
I'm enjoying our conversation.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.392
-[machine whirring]
-Oh.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.002
Apparently,
I'm the only one.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.396
Try to keep still
and no talking during the MRI.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.053
[knocking on door]

14:43.795 --> 14:45.232
Hi.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.364
Just checking in.

14:47.408 --> 14:50.585
I was thinking I could
talk to Villanueva if you want,

14:50.628 --> 14:52.239
about getting you
some more time off.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.111
Thanks, but I don't think
a few more days or...

14:55.155 --> 14:56.591
weeks will make
much of a difference.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.988
I'm not sure I can
ever come back.

15:03.946 --> 15:04.904
I'm sorry.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.000
[Dr. Park] Rod is placed.
Lock it in with set screws.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.740
Thank you.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.612
[Dr. Park] Jerome's still
not back today?

15:17.655 --> 15:20.658
No. He's not sure
he can come back at all.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.443
[Dr. Park] Too many memories.

15:22.486 --> 15:26.838
He's still in shock.
Now tighten
the instrumentation.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.666
At least Paul gets to know
the end is coming and prepare,

15:28.710 --> 15:31.104
say his goodbyes.

15:31.147 --> 15:34.368
[Dr. Park]
I don't think you can ever
really be prepared.

15:34.411 --> 15:36.892
And I wouldn't want my
loved ones to watch me suffer.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.459
Spine is stabilized.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.114
Continue with
the endoscopic decompression.

15:41.157 --> 15:44.944
So you'd rather not
know it's coming?

15:44.987 --> 15:47.511
I'll go to sleep one night,
never wake up, cut to black.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.646
Hold up.

15:53.082 --> 15:56.042
There's a clean margin
in the spinal column

15:56.085 --> 15:57.434
surrounding the entire length
of the tumor.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.262
That wasn't visible
in his previous imaging.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.091
The impact of his landing
must have

16:02.135 --> 16:04.050
cut off blood flow to the tumor
at its perimeter,

16:04.093 --> 16:06.313
caused it to shrink.
[chuckles]

16:06.356 --> 16:08.228
I think this gives us room
to do a cordectomy.

16:08.271 --> 16:09.838
We could remove
his entire tumor.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.187
And take out the majority

16:11.231 --> 16:13.363
of his thoracic spinal cord
with it.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.017
Would paralyze him
from the T3 down,

16:15.061 --> 16:17.063
and his cancer
will probably come back.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.413
But it'd give him
a lot more time.

16:19.456 --> 16:22.024
Let's close him up,
see what he wants to do.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.026
How much of his blood
have we banked so far?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.289
Only two units,
and if we draw more,

16:26.333 --> 16:27.943
he'll be too anemic
for surgery.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.379
We found another
in Australia,

16:29.423 --> 16:30.859
but it wouldn't get here
until the end of the week.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.904
[Shaun] We can't
wait that long.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.733
Naomi may be too unstable
to survive the transplant.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.345
We'll have to make it work
with the patient's own blood.

16:38.388 --> 16:41.087
We'll need to ligate every
vessel twice before cutting.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.002
Be precise and meticulous.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.221
I really don't want
Jesus' blood on my hands.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.093
Luckily, we will be
double-gloved.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.531
Give 7,000 units of Epogen

16:50.574 --> 16:53.664
and 150 milligrams of iron
to increase RBCs.

16:54.448 --> 16:55.579
Hi.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.712
Are you entering
your baking era?

16:57.755 --> 17:00.019
Nope. They're for Joelle.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.108
But I have three reject batches
I could bring you.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.502
-I'm good.
-Okay.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.766
Why are you making muffins
for Park and Morgan's nanny?

17:08.810 --> 17:11.247
Because soon
she'll be ours.

17:11.290 --> 17:14.250
I've come up with some
additional cost-saving measures

17:14.294 --> 17:15.598
so we can pay her
a little bit more.

17:15.643 --> 17:20.126
Mmm. There were
other candidates,

17:20.169 --> 17:23.259
many of them
very well qualified
and less expensive.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.740
Morgan stole our son's nanny.
That cannot stand.

17:25.782 --> 17:26.828
Out of principle.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.004
What principle?

17:30.919 --> 17:33.661
If we get all of the tumor,
which I think we can,

17:33.704 --> 17:36.577
we could extend your life
by five to 10 years.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.839
Maybe more.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.972
But I'll be a quadriplegic.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.844
It's likely you'll maintain
some use of your hands,

17:42.887 --> 17:44.541
unless the edema
spreads upwards.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.024
No, no, no, we're sticking with
our original plan.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.721
Just get me back on my feet
again, okay?

17:50.765 --> 17:52.680
Dad, they said years.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.899
You'd still have
all your mental faculties.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.205
And you'd have me to help.

17:58.555 --> 18:01.167
Can you get me some ice chips?
My mouth is really dry.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.868
Just think about it, please.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.014
Eve drew this
in kindergarten.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.408
I'm the tall one.
She's the one with the hair.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.149
[chuckles]

18:27.193 --> 18:30.674
She told me that her dream
was touching the sky with me.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.460
And I promised her
that we would do that one day.

18:33.503 --> 18:36.854
And then her mom and me,
we got a divorce,

18:36.898 --> 18:39.770
and I lost a lot of years
with my daughter.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.208
Well, this surgery would
give you a lot of years back.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.907
After all these years
of being absent,

18:45.950 --> 18:49.519
I can't ask her to spend
her 20s taking care of me.

18:51.086 --> 18:54.394
She should finish college,
start her own life.

19:00.878 --> 19:05.753
Hi. This is
Dr. Aaron Glassman again.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.711
No, okay.
I don't understand the delay.

19:10.671 --> 19:14.675
Fine. Um, can you please have
them call me back either way?

19:14.718 --> 19:16.633
Thank you.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.117
[exhales] How you feeling?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.772
Mm. You gave me
the good stuff, so...

19:24.815 --> 19:26.295
Yeah, well, guess what?

19:26.339 --> 19:28.515
After the surgery, you're not
gonna need the good stuff,

19:28.558 --> 19:30.647
nor are you going to need
to be telling stories

19:30.691 --> 19:32.649
about spilling pills
into toilets.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.652
-It wasn't--
-Don't bother.

19:35.696 --> 19:38.655
You left the emergency contact
blank on your pre-op form.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.353
You planning
to off me on the table?

19:40.396 --> 19:42.703
Well, I'm not planning on it.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.008
But if something were
to go wrong,

19:44.052 --> 19:46.054
I'm gonna need to contact
your mom or your dad.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.926
Good luck. They kicked me out
years ago, so...

19:50.667 --> 19:54.149
if you want someone
who cares if I die,
guess again.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.675
I'm gonna take the wild guess
that they still care.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.376
You'd be wrong.

20:09.425 --> 20:12.515
Father, thank you
for loving us somuch,

20:12.559 --> 20:14.691
and we ask that you heal
Ruth's back pain

20:14.735 --> 20:17.564
so she can get back to
the pickleball court.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.740
-Amen.
-[Ruth] Amen.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.830
The pain is gone!
Thank you.

20:22.873 --> 20:25.224
I think that's your pain meds
kicking in, Mrs. Wyatt.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.226
Let's go.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.926
I don't have time
to be looking all over for you.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.929
I'm sorry. Helping people
in pain is kind of my thing.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.800
No, it's my thing.
I'm the doctor,

20:36.844 --> 20:39.412
and my patients don't need
your snake oil.

20:39.455 --> 20:43.154
-I'm giving them comfort.
-You're giving them
false hope.

20:43.198 --> 20:46.506
It's okay if you're angry.
He gets that a lot.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.377
I'm not angry.
I just need you to stay put.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.510
-[sighs]
-I didn't mean right now.

20:50.553 --> 20:51.989
I just feel a little...

20:52.033 --> 20:54.427
[grunts]

20:54.470 --> 20:55.732
I need help!

21:05.046 --> 21:07.048
We cannot do
the kidney transplant

21:07.091 --> 21:09.093
until we know
why he collapsed.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.704
He's hypertensive
and tachycardic one moment

21:10.747 --> 21:12.575
and then stable
the next.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.925
Could be carcinoid syndrome
or renovascular hypertension.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.405
There are no suspicious
masses.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.451
His renal arteries
look normal.

21:18.494 --> 21:21.236
His labs rule out
hyperthyroidism.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.325
Everything about this guy
is crazy.

21:23.369 --> 21:27.808
Crazy is not a DSM-recognized
diagnosis, but you are correct.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.897
His underlying condition
must have psychiatric

21:29.940 --> 21:31.681
as well as
physical symptoms.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.003
He has a pheochromocytoma.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.962
We need to surgically
remove it.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.747
It could not be seen
on the MRI,

21:53.790 --> 21:55.966
but it has been flooding
his system with hormones.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.664
Once the pheo's out,
we may find

21:57.707 --> 22:00.144
Jesus has left the building,
taking both kidneys with him.

22:00.188 --> 22:03.060
If that happens,
Naomi almost certainly dies.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.846
We could remove the pheo
and the kidney
at the same time.

22:05.889 --> 22:08.239
Given his blood type,
every surgery is dangerous

22:08.283 --> 22:10.372
because of our limited supply
of Rhnull blood.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.156
[scoffs] Ethically,
there's no debate here,

22:12.200 --> 22:13.810
regardless
of medical issues.

22:13.854 --> 22:16.030
We remove the pheo,
then ask Jesus

22:16.073 --> 22:17.988
if he still wants to move
forward with the donation.

22:18.032 --> 22:19.729
Prep him for surgery.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.296
[Dr. Park] You're trying
to steal our nanny?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.560
Oh, Lea is trying
to steal your nanny

22:24.604 --> 22:26.736
because Morgan
stole her first.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.521
She didn't mention
that part.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.479
Although, Joelle was not
technically our nanny yet,

22:30.523 --> 22:32.046
but Lea is very passionate
about this,

22:32.089 --> 22:33.830
and I'm choosing
to support her.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.571
Yeah. Me, too.

22:35.615 --> 22:36.964
Oh, you're supporting Lea?

22:37.704 --> 22:39.445
No. Morgan.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.229
We need to do something
before this escalates

22:41.272 --> 22:43.013
and we're ordered not
to talk to each other anymore.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.973
We gotta sit down,
the four of us,
and work this out.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.279
Atrium Cafe.
Tuesday, noon.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.772
[knocking on door]

23:05.558 --> 23:07.211
Me again.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.517
You don't have to keep
checking in.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.172
I, um...

23:11.215 --> 23:13.087
I need a favor.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.784
It's kind of a big one.

23:17.483 --> 23:20.137
Due respect, Doctor,
the source of my divinity

23:20.181 --> 23:23.793
isn't just a pheo-whatever-
you-call-it.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.404
Your BP and heart rate
are stable.

23:25.447 --> 23:29.233
Our connection to God
is not that easily severed.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.409
I think you know that.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.801
Why do you keep thinking
you know me?

23:31.845 --> 23:33.934
You don't.
You didn't know my dead friend.

23:33.977 --> 23:37.154
You don't even know
who you are.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.765
I need to place
an arterial line.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.331
I know you're grieving.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.116
-I don't want
to talk about it.
-And you can't understand

23:42.159 --> 23:44.161
how your friend's death
could be part of God's plan.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.425
There is no plan.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.949
It's a lie,
and it's cruel.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.473
And I used to believe in it
somuch.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.781
Every time I lost a patient,
I would tell myself

23:54.824 --> 23:56.478
it's all a part
of a bigger picture.

23:56.522 --> 24:00.264
I took comfort in believing
youwere watching out for us.

24:00.308 --> 24:01.483
Even in the midst
of suffering,

24:01.527 --> 24:03.006
you were working things out
for our good,

24:03.050 --> 24:04.878
but it is all a lie.

24:04.921 --> 24:08.098
My friend was murdered
defending one of yourchildren.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.318
You let him bleed out
on the sidewalk all alone,

24:10.361 --> 24:12.929
and there was no one there to
tell him how much he was loved.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.762
He knew.

24:19.806 --> 24:20.763
I promise.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.638
He knew.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.253
Hey.
God will love you,

24:32.296 --> 24:33.733
no matter what
you say to Him

24:33.776 --> 24:36.300
or about Him.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.911
You just need
to keep talking.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.310
Okay, everyone, time to vote.
We need your help.

24:46.354 --> 24:49.879
Which peak should we climb,
Mission Peak or Mount Umunhum?

24:49.923 --> 24:51.881
Uh, Mission Peak is
an easier hike,

24:51.925 --> 24:54.667
but Mount Umunhum has
a better view of the sunset.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.930
[Jerome] I vote neither.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.105
[cell phone beeps]

24:58.148 --> 24:59.410
I hope that wasn't
a livestream.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.109
You're
the disappearing nurse.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.416
Jerome Martel.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.767
I'm sorry about that.
I, uh...

25:09.377 --> 25:13.642
I lost the love of my life
recently, very suddenly.

25:13.686 --> 25:17.733
And seeing the two of you,
you know...

25:17.777 --> 25:19.822
It must have struck
a little close to home.

25:21.694 --> 25:25.872
I wish I had known my last day
with him wasmy last day.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.743
Or my last month.

25:27.787 --> 25:30.398
So we could have made
the most of that time.

25:30.441 --> 25:33.183
Are you here to talk me
into the cordectomy?

25:34.837 --> 25:37.057
Asher and I made a plan

25:37.100 --> 25:42.584
to watch every Best Picture
winner since 1928.

25:42.628 --> 25:46.196
We made it to
The Godfather Part II.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.548
Asher fell asleep
halfway through, as usual.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.376
He was snoring so loudly,
I could hardly hear what
Pacino was saying,

25:55.379 --> 25:58.252
I don't know what
the right choice is
for you and your family.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.996
But I know there is nothing
I wouldn't give

26:03.039 --> 26:04.954
to sit by Asher's side

26:04.998 --> 26:07.566
and listen to him snore
through The English Patient.

26:12.396 --> 26:15.095
Dad. We could watch every one

26:15.138 --> 26:18.359
of those 30 for 30
documentaries you like.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.361
Even the ones
about hockey.

26:20.404 --> 26:23.799
Or we could start
our own two-person
true-crime book club.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.888
It wouldn't just be
fun and games, Eve.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.020
You'd also be stuck.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.935
Not stuck.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.066
Honored.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.375
Sure, I'd need help,

26:34.418 --> 26:37.944
but I can't lose you
after just getting you back.

26:37.987 --> 26:41.600
I want you to be there
when I graduate from college.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.384
Maybe walk me down
the aisle someday.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.656
Okay if I wheel you down?

26:57.006 --> 26:58.225
I'd love that.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.848
We removed
the pheochromocytoma.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.635
Do you still believe
you are Jesus?

27:18.811 --> 27:21.465
[exhales softly]

27:21.509 --> 27:24.643
My name is, um...
Is Carl.

27:26.775 --> 27:29.038
I remember
everything, but...

27:29.082 --> 27:31.737
I know I'm not Jesus.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.609
Are you still willing
to move forward

27:34.653 --> 27:36.219
with donating your kidney?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.310
I...

27:40.354 --> 27:41.877
I have no idea
what to do.

27:43.574 --> 27:47.666
We now only have one
remaining bag of Rhnull blood.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.189
That makes another surgery
quite high-risk.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.018
Donating your kidney to Naomi

27:52.061 --> 27:54.585
would be a very kind
thing to do.

27:57.719 --> 28:00.679
But as your surgeon,
it is not medically advisable.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.773
I can't do it.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.405
We've discussed
and would be willing...

28:31.448 --> 28:33.886
Reluctantly willing.

28:33.929 --> 28:37.759
...to hire Joelle
as a part-time nanny
so we can all share her.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.282
Returning half
of what you stole?

28:39.326 --> 28:40.806
What a cop-out.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.286
-Told you.
She's totally unreasonable.
-Excuse me?

28:43.330 --> 28:45.636
If you want
to see unreasonable,
let me hold up a mirror.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.203
Unless you already swiped that
from my bag.

28:47.247 --> 28:49.118
I've seen you knock-off bag.
There's nothing worth taking.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.294
[Shaun] Okay.
Would you be willing
to employ her

28:51.338 --> 28:53.035
on Tuesdays and Thursdays?

28:53.079 --> 28:54.123
And give you
a 60/40 advantage?

28:54.167 --> 28:55.298
We're the ones
who found her.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.386
We're the ones
who hired her.

28:56.430 --> 28:57.823
Youtake
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.476
I'll throw in my wine.
Deal?

28:59.520 --> 29:01.652
No deal, but I will give you
the stack of resumes

29:01.696 --> 29:03.089
from the people
we didn't hire.

29:03.132 --> 29:04.743
So we're supposed to just
pick through your leftovers?

29:04.786 --> 29:06.832
You already did,
except we were
stilleating her.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.703
I did not mean that
the way it sounded.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.575
How about a 50/50 split,
alternating weeks?

29:12.315 --> 29:13.882
I have a better idea.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.062
You're a genius.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.194
Savant.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.418
[Dr. Lim] So,
St. Bon's is now
in the daycare business?

29:28.462 --> 29:30.812
-[Dr. Glassman] You agreed.
-No, I just didn't
contradict you

29:30.856 --> 29:32.858
when you almost
immediately said yes.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.468
I'll take more 4-0
for tackups.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.339
You're opposed
to being family-friendly?

29:36.383 --> 29:38.211
I just didn't realize
your mini strokes
had turned you into

29:38.254 --> 29:39.386
such a softy.

29:40.735 --> 29:43.390
Between the daycare...
and her.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.087
[Dr. Glassman]
What about her?
She's a patient,

29:45.131 --> 29:46.523
who I happen to be
right about.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.134
Let's find out.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.093
Opening the arachnoid.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.965
[monitor beeping]

29:58.622 --> 30:00.886
Significant adhesions,

30:00.929 --> 30:04.367
fourth ventricular veil
restricting CSF flow.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.108
You were right.
Chiari Zero.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.199
This will only solve
one of Hannah's issues,

30:10.243 --> 30:11.853
and arguably the easier one.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.855
Her addiction will
still be a problem.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.858
Doesn't have to be yours.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.513
Watch your dissection.

30:36.182 --> 30:39.011
I've got your discharge papers
and your ride.

30:41.056 --> 30:45.365
My, uh, emergency contact
is my landlord.

30:49.499 --> 30:50.631
You want me to call him?

30:52.938 --> 30:54.896
I think my, um,

30:54.940 --> 30:56.637
brain tricked me
into thinking I was

30:56.680 --> 30:59.205
the most significant person
around because...

31:01.120 --> 31:02.861
I don't really matter
to anyone.

31:07.691 --> 31:10.607
Your friend,
what kind of man was he?

31:11.652 --> 31:13.480
Clever.

31:13.523 --> 31:16.396
Honest.

31:16.439 --> 31:18.702
Would make you laugh
as much as he would

31:18.746 --> 31:20.139
call you out
on your nonsense.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.884
And really brave.

31:29.539 --> 31:32.194
Maybe it wasn't a trick.

31:32.238 --> 31:35.850
Maybe your brain
just showed you the type
of person you could be.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.160
Maybe you came here
for a reason.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.077
Yeah.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.730
I'd like to think so.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.347
[sniffles]

31:57.828 --> 31:59.526
Um, I'd like to
donate my kidney.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.843
Sectioning the artery
with a vascular stapler.

32:12.887 --> 32:15.846
[Shaun] Vitals holding steady.
Kidney looks great.

32:15.890 --> 32:18.327
[Jordan] Ligating
the renal vein.

32:18.371 --> 32:21.722
Removing the left kidney.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.898
Let's get this over to Naomi.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.334
[alarms beeping]

32:25.378 --> 32:27.032
The vein tore.
He's hemorrhaging.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.163
Applying manual pressure.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.078
We need suction
and Cooley clamp.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.211
His renal vein must have
avulsed off the vena cava.

32:32.254 --> 32:34.169
We need to get
vascular control.

32:34.213 --> 32:36.302
200 cc. That's the last
of his banked blood.

32:36.345 --> 32:37.564
[Dr. Lim] Very aware.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.305
[Jordan] Please, please,
do not let this man die.

32:39.348 --> 32:41.089
[alarms continue beeping]

32:47.835 --> 32:48.923
[Dr. Lim] Sutures
aren't holding.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.620
[Jordan] Less than 100 cc
of blood left.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.274
-Can we ligate
the vena cava?
-[Shaun] Tissue is too friable.

32:52.318 --> 32:54.015
That could cause
complete renal failure.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.408
We should put in a graft.

32:55.451 --> 32:56.670
[Dr. Lim]
The walls are tearing.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.411
We need something
to get vascular control now.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.196
[Jordan]
A double-balloon occlusion.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.068
We can block it from above
and below at the same time.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.634
[Shaun] And we could use
the existing

33:04.678 --> 33:06.767
jugular central line
to get access.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.247
Fluoroscopy.

33:08.290 --> 33:10.945
[alarms beeping]

33:10.989 --> 33:12.860
[Dr. Lim]
I'll take the graft.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.514
Lap sponges.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.343
[Shaun] Advancing the catheter
to the SVC.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.214
[Dr. Lim] Call out
when he reaches the IVC.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.653
A little further.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.354
[Jordan] You're there.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.620
[Shaun] Inflating the balloons.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.978
[alarms stop]

33:44.022 --> 33:46.111
BP and heart rate
are stabilizing.

33:46.154 --> 33:48.591
[monitor beeping normally]

33:51.768 --> 33:53.031
[Jordan softly] Thank you.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.947
[knocking on door]

33:59.559 --> 34:00.734
I'm not here
to ask you to come back.

34:01.474 --> 34:02.562
Promise.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.173
I wrote a list.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.306
Yeah, come in.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.786
Anything anyone at St. Bon's
could remember Asher

34:09.830 --> 34:11.005
ever saying
he wanted to do.

34:17.141 --> 34:18.404
Save a cat in a tree.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.190
Learn Dothraki.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.672

34:29.154 --> 34:31.634
If you want, I thought
maybe we could...

34:31.678 --> 34:32.679
do some of it together.

34:35.464 --> 34:36.900
Thanks.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.902
But, uh...

34:38.946 --> 34:41.079

When I lost my mom,

35:40.834 --> 35:44.098
my whole world stopped
making sense.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.100
I looked to religion
for answers.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.276
I'm still searching
for what feels right,

35:48.320 --> 35:52.106
but I do know my mom's
not just gone.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.890
And I try to find
little ways

35:53.934 --> 35:55.544
to make her a part of my life
as much as I can.

Yeah, just finger tapping.

Both.

36:38.021 --> 36:39.240
Good.

36:39.284 --> 36:41.721
Grab my hands
and make a nice, tight grip.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.723

Uncomfortable?
That's normal,

considering the surgery
you've just been through.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.402

something?

37:13.405 --> 37:14.971
Your morphine's maxed out.

37:17.887 --> 37:19.802
But you know what
I can do?

37:19.846 --> 37:21.151
I can hang out
for a little while,

37:21.195 --> 37:22.544

37:22.588 --> 37:27.114
I can get a deck of cards.
