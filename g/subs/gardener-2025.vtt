02:18.125 --> 02:20.000
Help! Help!

02:28.083 --> 02:28.708
Help...

02:41.208 --> 02:44.500
Hornet One, the King is in check.
Repeat, King is in check.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.666
Help...

04:22.458 --> 04:24.875
You know how long I spent
on those flowers?

04:26.250 --> 04:26.958
No.

04:27.125 --> 04:28.250
A long time.

04:32.083 --> 04:36.375
THE GARDENER

04:48.125 --> 04:50.750
SIX HOURS EARLIER

05:11.125 --> 05:12.250
The list is ready.

05:12.416 --> 05:13.250
Yes, sir.

05:13.416 --> 05:14.708
It's on its way.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.041
There are only five this year.

05:17.208 --> 05:19.416
You have 48 hours to finish the job.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.375
It'll get done.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.583
I'll wait for the list.

05:30.541 --> 05:33.166
- I've received our codenames.
- Jealous?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.583
This year, you're Quasimodo.

05:37.291 --> 05:38.208
You're Esmeralda.

05:38.375 --> 05:41.125
Esmeralda?
Why do I always get the shitty name?

05:41.541 --> 05:43.458
- I'm Phoebus.
- I'm over it!

05:43.625 --> 05:45.666
The list is on its way
so get ready.

05:45.833 --> 05:47.041
Hunting season is open.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.958
It's going to be a bloodbath.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.375
Watch out!

06:27.458 --> 06:28.625
Believe me, Senator,

06:28.791 --> 06:31.500
I'm working from the Élysée
on a public holiday

06:31.666 --> 06:34.041
and the hallways
are not exactly full!

06:34.958 --> 06:37.208
I bet it's even worse
at the Senate!

06:39.416 --> 06:42.875
But I'm here because your bill
is important to the President.

06:44.625 --> 06:48.083
In fact, the President
has just walked in. One moment.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.333
- What?
- You're working.

06:50.791 --> 06:52.291
Yes, you are.

06:53.125 --> 06:56.541
- It's nothing...
- What are you, a YouTuber?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.375
Who are you trying to kid?

06:58.541 --> 07:00.208
- It's the weekend.
- It's Friday.

07:00.375 --> 07:03.458
We're in the countryside.
Your daughter's getting on my nerves.

07:03.625 --> 07:05.833
You shouldn't talk
about a baby like that.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.833
I'm talking about Selena Gomez, here.
You hear her?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Pack yo' bags and scram, son
Damn, son

07:11.166 --> 07:13.291
I'll pop you like ka-blam, son

07:13.458 --> 07:14.791
I'll draw a bath.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.875
Let me finish with Senator Bourlin

07:17.041 --> 07:19.875
then I'll jump in the bath
and I'm all yours.

07:20.041 --> 07:22.083
Don't you get it?
The bath is for me.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.541
Watch the baby for once.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.375
You think I don't want
to look after my own daughter?

07:26.541 --> 07:30.041
May I remind you, Mrs. Shuster,
I was a parent before you were.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.208
Your daughter?
Who slaps you on the back?

07:32.875 --> 07:33.625
Exactly!

07:33.791 --> 07:35.375
- Who takes your money?
- Exactly.

07:35.541 --> 07:37.833
Who calls you Serge?
She's not your daughter.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.666
She's your buddy.

07:40.041 --> 07:43.208
- Okay. Why don't you leave now?
- What about Charlotte?

07:43.916 --> 07:46.875
Did you breastfeed her?
Did you stretch your perineum?

07:47.250 --> 07:50.083
- Take some responsibility!
- Absolutely. Of course.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.875
I did try to draw milk
but none came out.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.875
As for the perineum,

07:55.041 --> 07:57.958
I'll check it out
next time I take a vacation in Rome.

07:59.458 --> 08:00.583
He's crashing!

08:02.750 --> 08:04.250
He's in hemorrhagic shock.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.500
There's no pulse.

08:09.833 --> 08:10.958
Absolutely.

08:11.875 --> 08:12.958
Absolutely.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.958
I have complete faith
in the President on this.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.083
I'll call Grondin as soon as I can.

08:18.875 --> 08:21.500
I mean,
I'll call his chief of staff.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.875
Yes, Grondin's chief of staff.
Absolutely.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.708
What do we have here?
Disgusting.

08:28.791 --> 08:30.000
Well, well!

08:31.666 --> 08:33.666
It's my old pal Sergio!

08:34.875 --> 08:35.916
I'll be damned.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.916
I need to go now, Mr. Secretary, sir.
I have another call.

08:40.583 --> 08:41.500
Thanks. Bye.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.416
How's it going?

08:44.666 --> 08:46.541
To what do I owe the pleasure

08:46.708 --> 08:49.250
of hearing your sweet,
yappy little voice?

08:49.416 --> 08:51.458
Yappy? You've got a nerve!

08:52.041 --> 08:53.666
You want me
to yap at you?

08:55.125 --> 08:57.583
Dominique!
How's my little Dodo?

08:57.750 --> 08:58.708
Great, great.

08:58.875 --> 08:59.708
So...

08:59.875 --> 09:03.458
would you believe it,
at the hospital this morning,

09:03.625 --> 09:05.125
I took delivery of a rider

09:05.291 --> 09:06.916
from the Republican Guard.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.041
This charming gentleman
who, by the way, is deceased,

09:11.208 --> 09:13.625
whose time on Earth
has reached an end...

09:13.791 --> 09:15.375
This gentlemen, in fact,

09:15.541 --> 09:18.208
was carrying an envelope
upon his person.

09:18.916 --> 09:19.916
We looked inside

09:20.083 --> 09:21.833
and found a list of names.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.791
- Five names.
- Okay. And?

09:24.250 --> 09:26.875
So I took a look
at these five names

09:27.333 --> 09:29.375
because, hey,
I know how to read,

09:29.541 --> 09:31.208
and what do I find?

09:31.375 --> 09:34.500
Your name, Sergio.
You're number five.

09:36.958 --> 09:38.541
I'm on a list of names?

09:38.708 --> 09:39.791
You're sure?

09:40.041 --> 09:42.583
What should I do with this robe?
It was on the floor.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.000
- The machine!
- What should I do?

09:46.416 --> 09:48.000
What kind of envelope?

09:48.166 --> 09:51.541
Kraft paper, and bloody.
Dripping with blood.

09:51.708 --> 09:53.291
The guy crashed, after all.

09:53.791 --> 09:56.708
Kraft paper?
That's the Ministry of Finance!

09:57.458 --> 09:58.166
Hey,

09:58.541 --> 10:03.291
looks like your pal Sergio is on
the shortlist to be Finance Minister!

10:03.458 --> 10:05.000
Hey, Mr. Minister!

10:05.416 --> 10:07.125
Don't forget your old friends!

10:07.791 --> 10:08.625
Champagne!

10:08.791 --> 10:11.333
Will you send me a photo
so I can see the list?

10:11.500 --> 10:12.916
I'll do that, Sergio.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.666
- No problem.
- Thanks, Dodo.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.833
- You hang up.
- No, you hang up.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.208
No, you hang up!

10:18.375 --> 10:21.666
Together, on three.
One, two, three...

10:21.833 --> 10:23.458
Three! I'm hanging up!

10:23.750 --> 10:24.833
He's so silly!

10:25.000 --> 10:26.750
Silly old Dodo!

10:28.708 --> 10:30.250
Sivardière...

10:30.416 --> 10:31.958
Why am I last?

11:04.666 --> 11:06.208
What the...

11:28.583 --> 11:30.291
I heard Dad saying,

11:30.458 --> 11:33.500
if you can get rid
of every single weed in the garden,

11:33.666 --> 11:34.833
he'll keep you.

11:35.291 --> 11:37.750
Have a good day, Miss Alice.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.833
Come on, don't be scared.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.125
He's shaking.

11:50.291 --> 11:52.375
I don't want to die,
I don't want to die...

11:52.541 --> 11:55.583
Why are you scared of death?
You work in a hospital.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.041
I feel bad.

11:57.208 --> 11:59.208
Let's get this straight
before we start.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.458
- What did I do?
- Let the adults speak.

12:02.166 --> 12:04.083
- Why Esmeralda?
- Why not?

12:04.250 --> 12:06.625
Because it sucks.
That book has other names.

12:07.250 --> 12:08.750
I think it suits you.

12:08.916 --> 12:10.291
Why are you Quasimodo?

12:10.458 --> 12:13.125
Don't forget, Esmeralda is a gypsy.
She's sexy.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.750
I can't stand carnies.
They stink.

12:15.916 --> 12:17.750
- I don't want to die!
- Oh, no!

12:17.916 --> 12:19.750
There, there, grandpa.

12:19.916 --> 12:21.750
His heart will stop
in three seconds.

12:21.916 --> 12:23.833
Go see your friends in heaven.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.375
There, there...

12:27.333 --> 12:28.416
Heart attack.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.125
Last call:

12:34.291 --> 12:37.000
Serge Shuster.
He sent him a photo of the list.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.750
Shuster?

12:39.458 --> 12:40.708
He's fifth on the list.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.666
He's now our primary target.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.375
Alice!

12:45.541 --> 12:48.708
Serge! Can't you see I'm busy?
Is this important?

12:48.875 --> 12:50.500
Yes, it's important.

12:50.875 --> 12:54.000
We need to look out for each other.
That's what families do.

12:54.166 --> 12:57.500
So, can you be nice to your sister
and keep the noise down?

12:57.666 --> 12:58.458
Half-sister.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.583
Stop that.

12:59.750 --> 13:00.916
She's my half-sister.

13:01.875 --> 13:05.083
The two of you today.
Unbelievable!

13:08.833 --> 13:10.500
Where are you, asshole?

13:12.750 --> 13:13.750
There you are.

13:13.916 --> 13:15.208
What does it say?

13:15.375 --> 13:17.250
He's here. Bingo.

13:17.416 --> 13:18.458
Out in the country

13:18.625 --> 13:20.583
at his second home
with his family.

13:20.958 --> 13:22.625
I want two teams on site.

13:22.791 --> 13:25.583
The whole family,
dying in a fire all at once...

13:27.125 --> 13:28.208
So sad!

13:28.375 --> 13:29.791
The angels of death.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.375
Mommy's taking a bath.
Just for five minutes.

13:43.166 --> 13:44.541
I'm going to kill her.

13:44.833 --> 13:45.750
No, baby!

13:46.375 --> 13:47.458
Sleepy time!

13:51.750 --> 13:52.958
Yes, my baby.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.083
Let's try this.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.166
That's it!

14:02.416 --> 14:04.000
Works every time.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.958
Why didn't I think of it sooner?

14:06.125 --> 14:09.375
Now, time for my bath.
Then I'm going to kill that girl.

14:09.875 --> 14:12.458
This street here,
he's first on the list.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.125
We could stop on the way.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.583
- It would help us warm up.
- Why not?

14:17.583 --> 14:18.375
He agrees.

14:18.541 --> 14:19.458
It saves time.

14:19.833 --> 14:20.958
Go on, Boss.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.875
I want to hurt somebody.
Please.

14:25.916 --> 14:27.791
Trimming, trimming! Good.

14:30.416 --> 14:31.541
Sir...

14:35.833 --> 14:36.916
Léo.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.666
I made you some fresh lemonade.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.583
- It's so hot.
- Yes, Jeanne.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.208
Thank you.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.083
Buddha's hand...

14:53.250 --> 14:55.458
- With...
- With?

14:55.625 --> 14:57.791
Three drops of citron.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.666
You're incredible, Léo.
Just incredible!

15:03.416 --> 15:04.708
Thanks, Jeanne.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.375
Okay, all done.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.333
So, mission number one
is complete.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.291
A fall down the stairs.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.291
I had other plans,

15:29.458 --> 15:31.583
but when the genius
of Isaac Newton

15:31.750 --> 15:33.458
coincides with state policy,

15:34.083 --> 15:36.333
well, gravity is the perfect weapon.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.458
Very theatrical,

15:37.625 --> 15:40.750
but tripping a guy on the stairs
doesn't make you a genius.

15:40.916 --> 15:41.916
Right, Boss?

15:42.250 --> 15:45.500
Number five, Shuster.
We're almost there.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.583
You were right.
This is so nice.

15:49.291 --> 15:50.708
This feels good.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.958
I should do this more often.

15:53.125 --> 15:53.916
Newsflash.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.333
Philippe Sivardière
has been found dead.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.875
He was chief of staff
to the Secretary of State for two years,

16:00.041 --> 16:02.041
managing international partnerships.

16:02.208 --> 16:04.458
More details to come...

16:04.625 --> 16:05.791
No!

16:05.958 --> 16:07.166
Mia!

16:07.541 --> 16:09.458
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah! So cool!

16:09.625 --> 16:11.791
- Sivardière is dead.
- Don't care!

16:12.166 --> 16:14.916
Not that I'm happy,
but it's one less name on the list.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.625
Still don't care.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.500
Poor guy.

16:20.416 --> 16:23.458
This is shaping up
to be an amazing weekend.

16:55.916 --> 16:57.041
Honey...

17:02.458 --> 17:03.958
What's all this?

17:04.125 --> 17:06.041
What are they doing
in the garden?

17:08.041 --> 17:09.166
This isn't right.

17:09.458 --> 17:11.166
This is private property!

17:11.333 --> 17:12.541
Get out!

17:12.708 --> 17:15.000
What is all this? It's not right.

17:15.916 --> 17:19.083
This is the best
that I have ever sung

17:19.250 --> 17:22.208
Right here, right now, today

17:22.375 --> 17:24.916
The best singing of all time

17:38.458 --> 17:39.708
What was that scream?

17:40.208 --> 17:41.833
It's not a scream, it's a note!

17:42.541 --> 17:44.000
You know she can't sing!

17:44.166 --> 17:47.125
I'm aware
of my daughter's vocal abilities.

17:47.291 --> 17:49.250
That was a scream. Alice?

17:50.625 --> 17:52.041
Alice, are you okay?

17:52.416 --> 17:54.958
Can't I get five minutes in peace?

17:56.750 --> 17:58.250
I'm getting out of the bath!

18:05.375 --> 18:07.375
My robe! Thanks, Jeanne!

18:08.833 --> 18:10.791
I don't ask for a lot.

18:10.958 --> 18:15.583
One weekend, five minutes for a bath.
But no, no way!

18:34.125 --> 18:35.666
You took my robe?

18:38.125 --> 18:39.750
It's a home-jacking.

18:41.541 --> 18:43.125
We have to call the police.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.291
When they get here
we'll be dead.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.416
Please, just call the police.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.291
- I've got this.
- No, you don't!

18:49.458 --> 18:51.375
I said, I've got this!

18:51.541 --> 18:53.833
Get a hold of yourself.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Find Charlotte, hide and stay quiet.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.666
- And you?
- Don't worry, I've got this.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.041
I'll...

19:01.333 --> 19:03.375
I'll deal with Alice and the police.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.416
Damn it! No service.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.375
Closet.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.375
Bathroom.

19:51.541 --> 19:52.958
Closet.

19:53.375 --> 19:54.250
Bathroom.

20:54.958 --> 20:56.208
Take that, you bastard!

20:57.250 --> 20:58.250
Shut your mouth!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.916
Five years of CrossFit, bitch!

21:02.041 --> 21:04.000
Washroom? Bedroom?

21:04.250 --> 21:05.416
Washroom...

21:09.250 --> 21:10.416
Help!

21:39.083 --> 21:39.958
Mr. Serge.

21:50.791 --> 21:51.666
Shuster...

21:52.416 --> 21:53.291
Are you okay?

21:54.458 --> 21:55.791
Are you okay?

22:27.833 --> 22:29.083
Mr. Serge?

22:45.041 --> 22:46.083
Holy crap!

22:49.666 --> 22:51.583
What is this stuff? It's strong!

22:52.041 --> 22:54.000
It's adrenaline, sir.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.458
Léo!

22:56.250 --> 22:59.250
My little Léo,
it's so good to see you again.

22:59.416 --> 23:02.083
That stuff sure works.
It's powerful, but itchy.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.791
I'm itching all over.

23:05.041 --> 23:06.000
That feels good.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.208
They're burglars!

23:13.375 --> 23:15.375
We're getting home-jacked, Léo!

23:15.541 --> 23:17.791
We're getting home-jacked!

23:17.958 --> 23:19.333
My wife!

23:19.500 --> 23:22.083
My daughters! My wife!

23:23.541 --> 23:24.541
They killed them.

23:24.708 --> 23:26.291
No, put them to sleep.

23:27.000 --> 23:27.958
They're sleeping.

23:28.125 --> 23:29.500
Thank you.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.083
They messed with the wrong guy.

23:34.375 --> 23:37.750
I'm not calling the police.
I'm calling Homeland Security.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.625
I'll get a SWAT team here.

23:39.791 --> 23:43.125
I'm sending these mofos
to Guantanamo!

23:43.291 --> 23:45.500
I'm Serge Shuster!

23:45.916 --> 23:46.958
There's no service.

23:47.125 --> 23:50.083
Good point.
I set up a Wi-Fi hub over here.

23:51.791 --> 23:53.083
Hornet one, status?

23:53.250 --> 23:55.958
Ready. All the pieces
are on the chessboard.

23:56.916 --> 23:57.916
All of them...

23:58.583 --> 24:00.541
- but the King and the Pawn.
- What?

24:01.333 --> 24:04.041
When we get there,
I want a full debrief.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.666
ETA, 30 minutes.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.583
If shit hits the fan
you can count on me.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.958
I'll be really nasty.
I'm a beast when I need to be.

24:14.666 --> 24:16.750
No service? No service!

24:16.916 --> 24:18.166
Why no service?

24:18.333 --> 24:21.000
Where are we?
Is this your cabin?

24:21.166 --> 24:22.458
Did you redecorate?

24:22.625 --> 24:23.916
It looks much bigger.

24:24.083 --> 24:25.458
It's a cave.

24:26.125 --> 24:27.125
A cave, where?

24:27.750 --> 24:29.416
The house is new,
not the cave.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.750
Léo, I'm getting a little tired
of your habit

24:33.916 --> 24:35.916
of being so consistently enigmatic.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.958
It's your choice
and I respect that,

24:39.666 --> 24:42.208
but your vocabulary
leaves a lot to be desired.

24:42.375 --> 24:46.125
So can you please explain more clearly
exactly where we are?

24:46.291 --> 24:47.708
Underneath your garden.

24:47.875 --> 24:50.291
The Resistance hid out here
during the War.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.666
Okay, a cave under my garden

24:52.833 --> 24:55.625
where the Resistance hid out
during the War.

24:55.791 --> 24:58.416
Nice and clear.
How did I not think of that?

24:58.833 --> 25:00.708
So, here's what we'll do...

25:03.000 --> 25:04.500
We let them find my Rolexes

25:05.125 --> 25:07.583
and the 10k in cash
hidden in my sock drawer

25:07.750 --> 25:09.833
then, boom, we let them leave.

25:10.750 --> 25:13.166
Wow!
You've got quite the arsenal!

25:13.333 --> 25:14.166
Careful!

25:14.333 --> 25:15.375
Don't touch, sir.

25:15.791 --> 25:17.208
Three Special Forces units?

25:17.708 --> 25:19.208
They want more than a Rolex.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.500
- Special Forces?
- Think for a second.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.500
Anything out of the ordinary?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

25:28.166 --> 25:31.333
A list of five ministers.
I might be made a minister.

25:31.625 --> 25:33.375
Except now there are four,

25:33.541 --> 25:37.000
since Sivardière fell down the stairs
and died like an asshole.

25:37.416 --> 25:40.375
So, yeah.
But apart from that, nothing.

25:40.958 --> 25:42.416
A list of five names?

25:43.416 --> 25:45.083
- Including yours?
- Yes.

25:47.916 --> 25:49.750
- And the first one is dead?
- Yes.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.125
The list was found

25:52.833 --> 25:56.541
on the body of a motorcycle rider
for the Republican Guard.

26:01.583 --> 26:02.625
What?

26:04.125 --> 26:05.791
The Matignon List.

26:05.958 --> 26:08.166
The Matignon List?

26:08.333 --> 26:10.541
It's a list of people

26:10.708 --> 26:13.333
whom the Prime Minister may,
and I stress may,

26:13.500 --> 26:16.291
be authorized to eliminate
for state purposes.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.000
Eliminate?

26:18.166 --> 26:22.333
Believe me, if it's the Matignon List
then these guys aren't burglars...

26:24.333 --> 26:26.250
and we're all going to die.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
You, too.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.166
That won't happen.

26:29.458 --> 26:31.000
Yes, you're going to die.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.958
Because I am already dead.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.583
What happened here?

26:47.500 --> 26:49.750
Esmeralda, gather our guests.

26:49.916 --> 26:51.125
This is their home,

26:51.291 --> 26:52.541
but I get the idea.

26:52.708 --> 26:55.583
As long as there are
no screaming kids, it's all good.

26:55.750 --> 26:56.875
Don't harm the family.

26:57.666 --> 26:58.708
Quasimodo?

26:59.291 --> 27:00.666
Take care of the rest.

27:00.958 --> 27:02.916
I'll build us a beautiful fire,

27:03.083 --> 27:04.541
just like Notre-Dame.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.500
Like in the film? Pretty smart.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.041
For a hunchback!

27:10.000 --> 27:11.791
I think we're going
to like it here.

27:14.666 --> 27:18.500
I promised to take Mia to Peru
to explore Machu Picchu.

27:20.250 --> 27:22.000
And little Charlotte.

27:22.166 --> 27:23.375
My baby!

27:24.458 --> 27:26.291
I never made the most of her.

27:26.750 --> 27:28.791
But why? Why me?

27:30.333 --> 27:31.833
I love plants.

27:32.791 --> 27:34.083
Why do you say that?

27:36.208 --> 27:38.041
Because plants don't complain.

27:38.458 --> 27:41.166
They live, they die,
and never complain.

27:41.333 --> 27:42.958
I'm not complaining.

27:43.125 --> 27:45.625
Sorry for caring
about the fate of my family!

27:45.791 --> 27:47.916
You're alone. Nobody will miss you.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.625
Okay, thanks, I get it.

27:50.250 --> 27:51.291
But I'm different.

27:51.791 --> 27:53.500
- It's you they want.
- And?

27:53.666 --> 27:55.375
Why shouldn't they kill my family?

27:55.750 --> 27:57.333
It has to look natural.

27:57.625 --> 28:00.541
A fall, a heart attack, a fire...

28:01.125 --> 28:01.916
Okay.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.000
So tell me, Mr. Know-it-all,

28:04.500 --> 28:05.875
why me?

28:07.083 --> 28:08.250
Why are you on the list?

28:08.416 --> 28:09.458
I don't know.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.375
Maybe a sensitive document.

28:15.541 --> 28:16.833
That's it.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.541
It's the file!

28:19.916 --> 28:21.833
Two weeks ago I was sent a file

28:22.000 --> 28:24.500
about this alleged list,
so I read it

28:24.666 --> 28:26.291
and forwarded it to Sivardière,

28:26.458 --> 28:27.666
then, boom, this morning,

28:28.583 --> 28:30.666
Sivardière falls down his stairs,

28:30.833 --> 28:32.416
and, double-boom, today,

28:32.750 --> 28:35.625
Special Forces show up
at my country home.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
That's it!

28:37.166 --> 28:38.833
That's why I'm on the list!

28:43.291 --> 28:44.500
I'm good.

28:44.666 --> 28:46.041
Really good.

28:46.833 --> 28:48.208
Now, Léo,

28:48.375 --> 28:51.458
I know this isn't your forte
and it will probably upset

28:51.625 --> 28:53.125
your daily routine.

28:53.708 --> 28:54.833
I want you to help me.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.625
We're going to get that file
off my computer

28:57.791 --> 29:01.500
and use it like a bulletproof vest
to turn the odds in our favor.

29:02.125 --> 29:05.125
Then we screw those bastards
and all their mothers!

29:06.250 --> 29:07.375
Sorry, guys!

29:07.833 --> 29:09.583
Now it's your turn
to be scared!

29:16.208 --> 29:19.083
Not the most flattering outfit
but you get the idea.

29:40.666 --> 29:43.250
- What happened?
- Beware...

29:43.875 --> 29:46.041
- What?
- Beware the gar...

29:46.666 --> 29:47.666
The what?

29:47.833 --> 29:49.666
Beware the gar...

29:49.833 --> 29:51.000
The garage?

29:51.541 --> 29:53.958
Somebody's in the garage?
Is that it?

29:55.875 --> 29:57.208
Beware the gar...

29:58.500 --> 30:01.166
Garbage man?
Was it the garbage man?

30:01.333 --> 30:02.875
Did a garbage man do this?

30:03.041 --> 30:04.625
A garbage man? No!

30:04.791 --> 30:06.750
Beware the gar...

30:07.541 --> 30:08.708
Garden gnomes?

30:09.083 --> 30:10.541
What do we have to beware?

30:10.833 --> 30:13.250
That "gar"!
It's the garbage man!

30:13.416 --> 30:15.125
God damn it!

30:15.666 --> 30:18.166
It was the garbage man!
Beware the garbage man!

31:00.458 --> 31:01.583
Ready?

31:03.333 --> 31:04.541
What do you mean?

31:05.166 --> 31:06.000
Like that?

31:06.166 --> 31:08.458
With no guns,
just some pruning shears

31:08.833 --> 31:10.041
and a dibber?

31:12.291 --> 31:14.708
Maybe you think it's fun
to play Rambo

31:14.875 --> 31:17.166
but are you really
Sylvester Stallone?

31:19.916 --> 31:21.958
You may be an ace
at pruning roses

31:22.125 --> 31:25.875
but we're not fighting stubborn ferns
or Mexican orange blossom.

31:26.166 --> 31:28.500
These are killers on a mission

31:28.666 --> 31:31.583
and I'm not sure
you're able to handle that.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.291
So if I can't count on you,
I'll do this alone.

31:34.666 --> 31:36.083
You're taking too long.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.208
What?

31:37.708 --> 31:38.500
Too long?

31:40.791 --> 31:43.458
Mr. Serge, when you talk,
it takes too long.

31:45.250 --> 31:47.875
Better too long than too short.
Wait up!

31:48.041 --> 31:51.000
- How long to find the file?
- Maybe five minutes.

31:51.166 --> 31:52.500
No. Three.

31:52.666 --> 31:54.041
Okay, three.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.083
I just love working
with beeswax.

32:17.583 --> 32:19.125
It has three advantages.

32:20.041 --> 32:22.625
It burns by itself,
leaves zero trace...

32:23.833 --> 32:26.583
and smells amazing.
Not bad, huh?

32:26.750 --> 32:29.000
You Africans sure love aromas.

32:29.166 --> 32:31.291
I had a Malian neighbor,
Mrs. Soumaké.

32:31.458 --> 32:33.416
Her maafe stew was...

32:34.458 --> 32:35.666
Pretty potent!

32:35.833 --> 32:37.208
Shut your damn trap.

32:37.375 --> 32:38.541
What did I say?

32:50.666 --> 32:51.875
Leave this to me.

32:54.875 --> 32:56.250
Be stealthy.

33:00.166 --> 33:01.708
Go, go!

33:03.250 --> 33:04.291
Stop!

33:16.041 --> 33:17.208
Those are delicate.

33:17.583 --> 33:18.708
White azaleas.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.791
Léo, I can hear you!

33:23.958 --> 33:25.833
This is no time for topiary!

33:35.500 --> 33:36.250
Shit.

33:36.416 --> 33:37.958
Shuster's getting away!

33:46.208 --> 33:49.000
He's getting away.
And they call us thugs!

33:52.666 --> 33:54.416
Don't make a sound.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.333
Watch me. Silent.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.375
This way.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.916
Now,

34:09.083 --> 34:10.750
we synchronize watches.

34:12.041 --> 34:14.083
Oh, you don't have one.
Great.

34:14.250 --> 34:15.625
Three minutes.

34:26.208 --> 34:27.666
Here goes.

34:28.375 --> 34:29.083
So...

34:30.333 --> 34:33.083
The file on the Matignon List.

34:33.708 --> 34:36.541
You're the reason
the PM wants me dead.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.541
Except, boom,

34:38.708 --> 34:40.250
you messed with Sergio.

34:40.416 --> 34:43.583
Now I'm pissed
and you're gonna regret it

34:43.750 --> 34:46.375
because, bam, Sergio

34:46.541 --> 34:49.958
is going to Bluetooth it
to his phone

34:50.541 --> 34:51.583
which is...

34:53.000 --> 34:54.583
Shit!

34:55.041 --> 34:56.458
Phone?

34:58.333 --> 34:59.291
My USB!

34:59.875 --> 35:02.083
Where did I put my USB drive?

35:02.625 --> 35:03.750
USB drive?

35:03.916 --> 35:05.916
U-S-B?

35:06.083 --> 35:07.583
No, I don't.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.166
Great! Thanks a lot!

35:11.541 --> 35:13.666
Yes! I'm a genius.

35:14.291 --> 35:16.166
I'll send it to Charlotte's iPod.

35:16.541 --> 35:17.416
There.

35:17.583 --> 35:18.625
And...

35:35.375 --> 35:36.500
We're okay.

35:37.166 --> 35:38.250
Now,

35:39.083 --> 35:40.458
this goes here...

35:41.750 --> 35:43.416
Daddy's going to save you.

35:45.291 --> 35:46.708
Where are you going?

35:46.875 --> 35:49.791
To get the iPod
from Charlotte's room.

35:50.750 --> 35:52.125
Stay with me!

35:54.541 --> 35:56.208
- Stay with me!
- Listen, Léo.

35:56.375 --> 35:58.208
This is going super well.

35:58.708 --> 36:01.875
Go look after your roses.
Leave the action to me.

36:03.166 --> 36:05.333
I did seven years
of Shotokan Karate.

36:05.583 --> 36:06.750
Don't worry.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.416
- Come here!
- No!

36:09.375 --> 36:11.125
I'll be as quiet as a hyena.

36:16.333 --> 36:18.791
Hurry!
And bring them back unharmed!

36:18.958 --> 36:20.166
Let's go!

36:20.333 --> 36:21.416
Move it!

36:21.583 --> 36:23.125
Hurry up!

36:24.166 --> 36:26.875
Come on, let's go!

36:27.041 --> 36:27.958
Come on!

36:29.000 --> 36:30.375
There you go.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.541
Faster!

36:47.833 --> 36:49.166
Quiet!

37:04.750 --> 37:06.708
It's usually right here.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.791
It's always here.

38:04.291 --> 38:06.083
Don't touch me.
I have a baby.

38:24.916 --> 38:26.500
The boat was empty.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.250
That bastard!
It was a diversion.

38:31.416 --> 38:33.583
Quasimodo, perimeter check.
Esmeralda...

38:33.750 --> 38:35.166
Stop calling me that.

38:35.333 --> 38:37.583
The King is on the board.
Time to play.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.083
Understood.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.958
Time to unleash hell.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.333
Watch the old lady.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.041
Go!

39:08.458 --> 39:09.083
Keep quiet.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.041
Keep quiet...

39:24.125 --> 39:25.708
This guy is looking at me.

39:52.083 --> 39:53.083
Sweetheart.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.208
I'd make a great father.

39:55.791 --> 39:57.041
Here, take her.

39:57.208 --> 39:58.416
Are you crazy?

40:04.125 --> 40:05.125
You're so handsome!

40:15.958 --> 40:16.916
Léo! Problem!

40:17.583 --> 40:18.541
I'll crush you.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.416
You and your stupid baby.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.625
Jesus, filthy kid!

40:37.833 --> 40:39.166
It went in my mouth!

40:43.625 --> 40:45.208
Judas!
Right in the back.

40:46.458 --> 40:47.416
Nice work.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.458
Mr. Serge, we have to go.

40:50.250 --> 40:51.458
Let's go.

40:56.125 --> 40:57.583
You're a dead man.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.375
- What about my family?
- No time.

41:03.458 --> 41:04.750
- Wait!
- What?

41:04.916 --> 41:06.666
- Through here.
- No, bad idea!

41:06.833 --> 41:07.750
Go!

41:07.916 --> 41:09.041
Bad idea!

41:16.166 --> 41:18.000
We can't hide in here.

41:18.375 --> 41:19.541
Yes, we can.

41:19.708 --> 41:21.375
I know this house better than you.

41:21.541 --> 41:23.791
You should listen to me
once in a while.

41:24.333 --> 41:27.291
- Keep going.
- It's a dead end. What do we do?

41:27.791 --> 41:29.083
Keep going.

41:29.500 --> 41:32.208
Where? Into the shelving?

41:32.375 --> 41:34.125
You want me to hide in a jar?

41:34.625 --> 41:35.583
Important.

41:37.375 --> 41:38.708
Charlotte says thank you.

41:38.875 --> 41:40.458
Now what do we do?

41:40.625 --> 41:41.500
Keep going.

41:42.833 --> 41:43.833
We keep going.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Come on.

41:51.416 --> 41:52.250
Incredible!

41:52.416 --> 41:53.333
Wait.

41:53.500 --> 41:55.000
Incredible!

41:57.833 --> 41:59.083
- Don't move.
- I'm not.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.500
I'll shut the door.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.833
- Mr. Serge?
- Yes?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.458
- Are you shaking?
- Yes.

42:09.625 --> 42:11.000
From cold or fear?

42:11.166 --> 42:13.083
Probably both.

42:13.416 --> 42:15.791
So, a gardener
who trained in combat sports?

42:15.958 --> 42:18.541
You never mentioned that
on your résumé.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.291
Care to explain?

42:20.833 --> 42:22.250
Or not?

42:22.416 --> 42:23.541
Wait.

42:26.916 --> 42:28.083
Through here.

42:28.875 --> 42:30.958
Who pays for this electricity?

42:43.583 --> 42:47.166
The last modification
was to copy a file to...

42:47.333 --> 42:49.000
an iPod.

42:49.166 --> 42:50.250
Cunning bastard.

42:50.416 --> 42:52.291
Somebody puked in my mouth.

42:52.458 --> 42:53.791
Shuster has company.

42:54.291 --> 42:55.375
There's another guy,

42:55.541 --> 42:58.166
a family friend, a security agent,
who knows.

42:58.708 --> 43:00.250
Either way, I got a face-full.

43:02.125 --> 43:03.666
Handsome guy, too.

43:03.833 --> 43:06.208
Beautiful skin. Very limber.

43:07.416 --> 43:08.666
Look into this guy.

43:09.708 --> 43:11.500
I've got DNA samples from his tools.

43:11.666 --> 43:12.708
And?

43:12.875 --> 43:15.833
It will give us a full profile
of Esmeralda's boyfriend.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.708
If he waxes his crack, I'll know.

43:19.708 --> 43:21.625
Mr. T makes jokes, now?

43:22.416 --> 43:24.291
I'm taking a shower. I stink.

43:25.166 --> 43:26.458
Thanks, Boss.

43:26.625 --> 43:28.125
His strength was uncanny.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.750
I couldn't stop him.
He's a madman.

43:30.916 --> 43:32.791
Find out how they left the house!

43:32.958 --> 43:35.083
Search everywhere! Everywhere!

43:36.708 --> 43:38.208
They won't hurt them.

43:38.708 --> 43:40.666
- How do you know?
- I just know.

43:40.833 --> 43:43.916
Sure, you know all about plants
and beating guys up.

43:44.083 --> 43:46.000
But the human soul
is more complex.

43:46.166 --> 43:47.541
They're going to kill them.

43:47.708 --> 43:49.541
They would have done it by now.

43:50.541 --> 43:53.958
Speaking of doing things...
I think she just did something.

43:54.458 --> 43:56.291
In fact, I'm sure she did.

44:00.083 --> 44:01.666
Didn't I tell you?

44:02.166 --> 44:04.458
I knew this was a risk, but...

44:05.083 --> 44:07.125
that poop is revolting.

44:08.791 --> 44:11.208
- We need diapers.
- Yup, diapers.

44:12.291 --> 44:13.250
Your robe.

44:14.250 --> 44:15.083
What about it?

44:15.458 --> 44:17.875
- Make a diaper from my robe?
- Yes.

44:18.041 --> 44:20.583
I'm cold enough with it on.
No way.

44:20.750 --> 44:22.708
There are more clothes
down there.

44:23.166 --> 44:25.625
Great. Let's make diapers
out of those.

44:25.791 --> 44:29.166
The clothes are from 1943.
Not great for babies' skin.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.666
- True.
- Yeah.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.666
But no, no...

44:34.416 --> 44:35.416
Your robe.

44:36.666 --> 44:37.500
Go on!

44:37.666 --> 44:39.583
This is ridiculous. Turn around.

44:41.375 --> 44:43.750
They may be killers
but I'm still your boss.

44:44.791 --> 44:46.333
Ridiculous!

44:46.791 --> 44:48.458
You're a pervert.

44:59.916 --> 45:01.708
You'll catch a cold, Mr. Serge.

45:01.875 --> 45:03.791
There's no way I'm wearing this.

45:03.958 --> 45:06.083
Out of the question! No!

45:06.416 --> 45:07.958
No, Léo.

45:08.375 --> 45:11.166
I'm sorry
but there's just no way.

45:12.625 --> 45:14.208
I'm not comfortable with this.

45:14.375 --> 45:17.500
First, in terms of comfort,
it's not my size.

45:17.666 --> 45:19.750
It's way too big. Look.

45:19.916 --> 45:23.000
And also for moral reasons!
I mean, really!

45:23.166 --> 45:26.666
When your name is Serge Shuster,
with those initials,

45:26.833 --> 45:29.000
you can't wear a Wehrmacht uniform.

45:29.166 --> 45:32.458
The cap?
I'm not wearing it. No way.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.833
If you'd said, "Try an SS Uniform,"
now that would be different.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.958
Not that I support the SS.
I hate them.

45:39.125 --> 45:40.166
So do I.

45:40.333 --> 45:42.541
But at least that
was designed by Hugo Boss,

45:42.708 --> 45:44.416
it has more muted colors...

45:44.583 --> 45:45.541
It's a strong look.

45:45.708 --> 45:48.708
When they walked into town,
they made an impression!

45:48.875 --> 45:50.916
The Wehrmacht uniform
just can't compete.

45:51.625 --> 45:52.875
Shall we change the baby?

45:53.041 --> 45:54.750
- That's not a diaper.
- Yes it is.

46:00.083 --> 46:01.750
Status?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.333
Still looking, sir.

46:07.250 --> 46:08.375
Here we go...

46:10.458 --> 46:12.125
And, all done.

46:17.250 --> 46:18.333
She's beautiful.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.291
I made a fuss
but it wasn't so hard.

46:22.125 --> 46:26.333
I always object to doing it,
which my wife hates, but now,

46:26.500 --> 46:28.541
I'll be the one changing diapers.

46:29.291 --> 46:30.500
Right, Charlotte?

46:30.666 --> 46:34.708
Daddy's the one who's gonna change
your diapers. Isn't Daddy clever?

46:35.666 --> 46:37.958
Daddy's gonna change your diapers.

46:38.291 --> 46:39.791
Right, Charlotte? Yes!

46:46.666 --> 46:48.333
Some diaper!

46:49.291 --> 46:50.458
Nice work!

46:50.625 --> 46:53.041
Mr. Serge, can I try?

46:53.208 --> 46:55.125
You think you're best
at everything?

46:58.333 --> 47:00.916
The technique is not the problem.
It's the diaper.

47:01.083 --> 47:02.208
You cut it wrong.

47:02.625 --> 47:04.875
Please!
Léo, it will never stay on.

47:05.041 --> 47:05.958
Watch.

47:08.166 --> 47:09.125
There.

47:09.541 --> 47:11.375
Don't be smug.
It's just a diaper.

47:12.208 --> 47:14.750
Isn't he proud?
Look how happy Léo is!

47:15.166 --> 47:18.541
He managed to fasten a diaper!
Incredible!

47:18.958 --> 47:20.833
Can I have my daughter back now?

47:22.000 --> 47:22.958
Thank you.

47:24.333 --> 47:25.500
That's right.

47:26.583 --> 47:28.958
You prefer Daddy don't you?
Oh, yes.

47:29.625 --> 47:32.750
Oh, yes, my little girl.
You prefer Daddy.

47:32.916 --> 47:34.833
Not Léo. He's dirty.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.708
Léo's dirty, isn't he?

47:36.875 --> 47:38.583
With his dirty old hands.

47:38.750 --> 47:40.333
That's better.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.875
Goo-goo, ga-ga.

47:44.375 --> 47:45.250
Battery's dead.

47:46.333 --> 47:48.750
The alarm will sound
in five, four,

47:49.791 --> 47:50.416
three,

47:51.375 --> 47:52.291
two...

47:54.250 --> 47:54.875
one...

47:58.166 --> 47:59.125
There she goes!

47:59.291 --> 48:02.958
She'll do this for 20 minutes.
Nothing can stop her.

48:03.125 --> 48:05.500
- There's music on this?
- Yes. What are you doing?

48:05.666 --> 48:08.500
Where are you taking it?
Be careful!

48:08.666 --> 48:10.041
That thing saves lives!

48:10.208 --> 48:12.250
What will save your family's lives...

48:12.541 --> 48:13.458
is me.

48:14.541 --> 48:16.541
Don't get cocky, Léo.

48:18.958 --> 48:20.500
You're getting a big head.

48:20.666 --> 48:22.166
Deflate it a little.

48:22.333 --> 48:25.000
Nice, big vegetables? Sure.
But not your head.

48:25.458 --> 48:27.958
You win a few fights
and think you're the best!

48:28.125 --> 48:29.916
Now the guy's a hero!

48:30.083 --> 48:32.791
What are you doing,
rummaging back there?

48:32.958 --> 48:35.625
If you're dressing as a Nazi,
it's not funny.

48:35.791 --> 48:38.791
That's right, Charlotte.
You carry on.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.750
Where is my baby?
She's only six months old.

48:41.916 --> 48:43.791
Where's my dad?

48:43.958 --> 48:47.541
- Take whatever you want!
- These women are busting my balls.

48:47.708 --> 48:49.333
My dad is an important man...

48:49.500 --> 48:51.833
Tell your daughter to shut up
and you too!

48:52.000 --> 48:52.916
She's not my mom.

48:53.083 --> 48:54.500
Now I'm getting pissed.

48:54.666 --> 48:55.833
I'm not backing down.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.375
- My baby...
- Sit down.

48:58.166 --> 49:00.458
I don't know where
your husband and daughter are.

49:00.875 --> 49:02.166
I bet that sucks for you.

49:02.333 --> 49:05.333
Listen, kid,
do you want a smack in the face?

49:05.500 --> 49:07.208
This isn't Pokémon,
it's real life.

49:07.375 --> 49:09.250
Look at me.
I'll teach you a thing or two.

49:09.416 --> 49:10.375
Awake at last!

49:16.291 --> 49:19.000
Apart from your family,
who else is in this house?

49:19.583 --> 49:20.791
Nobody.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.375
Nobody, I swear.

49:22.541 --> 49:23.875
What about Léo?

49:24.125 --> 49:25.000
Léo?

49:26.208 --> 49:27.250
Who is Léo?

49:27.416 --> 49:28.583
The gardener.

49:30.333 --> 49:31.458
- You're lying.
- No!

49:31.625 --> 49:33.458
- Yes.
- You said, "in this house."

49:33.625 --> 49:34.666
You have a liar's face.

49:34.833 --> 49:36.000
He's in the garden.

49:36.833 --> 49:38.625
- Doing what?
- Gardening.

49:38.791 --> 49:41.083
- Okay, I'm done.
- This is your fault.

49:41.250 --> 49:43.541
You want the right answer?
Ask the right question.

49:44.375 --> 49:47.750
I'm leaving. If I don't,
someone's going to get killed.

49:50.083 --> 49:51.416
Five cranks of the handle,

49:51.583 --> 49:52.958
five minutes of music.

49:56.291 --> 49:57.708
Look at that!

49:58.416 --> 49:59.875
I mean...

50:00.708 --> 50:01.916
Bravo!

50:02.083 --> 50:03.958
Bravo, Mr. DIY!

50:04.333 --> 50:05.250
You amaze me.

50:05.750 --> 50:07.583
So, what's the plan?

50:12.250 --> 50:13.583
Weird guy.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.583
The gardener's name is
Léonidas Apastegui.

50:16.750 --> 50:18.791
Nothing on him since he was 20.

50:18.958 --> 50:22.000
Since then he's been a ghost.
Dropped off the radar.

50:23.375 --> 50:26.333
Why can't I access the file?

50:26.500 --> 50:28.833
This is bullshit.
I can't access his file.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.500
Crack the file. Quickly.

50:31.166 --> 50:32.375
Look at him smolder!

50:32.541 --> 50:33.958
Who is this guy?

50:35.041 --> 50:37.000
I told your dad he was weird.

50:38.208 --> 50:39.416
So, Léo,

50:39.583 --> 50:44.166
you didn't learn how to massacre
Special Forces in gardening class.

50:44.583 --> 50:45.791
That's for sure.

50:46.375 --> 50:48.250
How do you know this house
so well?

50:49.375 --> 50:52.708
There are a lot of mysteries
to clear up, no?

50:53.083 --> 50:55.375
Don't you think
it's time to confess?

51:16.750 --> 51:17.958
Go ahead.

51:19.208 --> 51:20.333
"I..."

51:25.208 --> 51:26.666
I...

51:33.416 --> 51:34.541
Go on.

51:36.833 --> 51:38.083
- Go on!
- No.

51:39.625 --> 51:40.500
"No"?

51:42.333 --> 51:45.041
You started out so well! No!

51:45.208 --> 51:47.291
That's a shitty move.
Real shitty.

51:47.916 --> 51:50.083
You never finish your sentences!

51:50.500 --> 51:52.333
Thanks a lot! Bravo!

51:52.500 --> 51:53.416
Great.

51:53.583 --> 51:54.708
I don't get you.

51:55.333 --> 51:58.333
Must be a gardener thing.
Who knows.

51:59.416 --> 52:00.458
Sir?

52:02.166 --> 52:03.166
We found something.

52:20.333 --> 52:22.416
So this is their little burrow.

52:25.333 --> 52:27.291
Root the vermin out.

52:27.458 --> 52:29.791
I'll get those rats
out of their nest.

52:30.250 --> 52:32.416
- Alive.
- All of them?

52:33.291 --> 52:35.291
Just Shuster.

52:41.958 --> 52:43.291
Listen, Léo...

52:45.458 --> 52:47.041
I know you're old,

52:48.375 --> 52:50.541
but you didn't fight
in World War II.

53:02.708 --> 53:05.208
Why don't you just
tell me your story?

53:05.375 --> 53:06.750
Aren't we friends now?

53:17.083 --> 53:18.583
There's no time.

53:18.875 --> 53:20.958
- We've got company.
- Another excuse!

53:21.125 --> 53:23.583
- Lights out.
- What? Why?

53:24.208 --> 53:25.791
It's about to get interesting.

53:25.958 --> 53:27.916
What do I do? Hey!

53:28.083 --> 53:30.416
Nothing. Do absolutely nothing.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.500
Let's go.

54:35.875 --> 54:37.666
Sleepy time, now.

54:38.291 --> 54:40.333
Here, music. I'm begging you.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.416
It's sleepy time.

54:42.583 --> 54:44.708
Yes, beautiful. Sleepy time.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.291
Come here.
You're a dead man.

55:19.458 --> 55:21.458
Come on! Do it!

55:22.958 --> 55:24.083
You'll see.

55:25.166 --> 55:26.416
You're dead!

56:05.125 --> 56:06.666
Seeing better, now?

56:16.875 --> 56:18.833
You goddamn idiot!

56:20.208 --> 56:21.291
Sorry!

56:21.458 --> 56:23.541
I told you, don't do anything!

56:23.708 --> 56:24.875
I can't see in here!

56:30.166 --> 56:31.458
Shuster!

56:31.791 --> 56:34.375
- Finally, the King is in check!
- No!

56:35.166 --> 56:36.666
I'm not the King.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.583
You're scaring me!

56:43.791 --> 56:45.875
You're lucky
the Boss wants you alive.

56:48.166 --> 56:49.708
I could have ended you.

56:55.208 --> 56:56.041
Nice!

56:58.500 --> 56:59.875
I hope that hurts!

57:03.625 --> 57:05.458
I didn't say anything!

57:33.333 --> 57:34.583
- You okay?
- Adrenaline!

57:34.750 --> 57:36.625
- What?
- Adrenaline!

57:39.500 --> 57:40.833
In the thigh?

57:46.375 --> 57:48.541
Thank you, Mr. Serge.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.041
Your glasses.

57:51.708 --> 57:54.083
- We can't stay here.
- Okay, let's go.

57:54.958 --> 57:56.000
Well done, Léo.

58:00.875 --> 58:02.416
Gardener, do you read me?

58:03.583 --> 58:04.625
Gardener!

58:06.541 --> 58:09.750
This was supposed to be easy.
Now we're hunting a madman.

58:09.916 --> 58:12.208
As plans go,
it's pretty bad, Boss.

58:12.375 --> 58:13.416
A florist!

58:13.583 --> 58:15.500
A florist? No.

58:16.083 --> 58:18.041
He's a shear assassin.

58:18.208 --> 58:19.583
A snip-snipping psycho.

58:19.750 --> 58:21.750
I warned you
but nobody listened.

58:21.916 --> 58:24.000
I sounded the alarm, Boss.

58:25.458 --> 58:28.208
How are we supposed to succeed
when I'm called Esmeralda?

58:28.583 --> 58:29.916
It doesn't suit me.

58:30.083 --> 58:32.000
Sure, I'm somewhat refined.

58:32.166 --> 58:33.291
I could even be a model.

58:33.458 --> 58:35.791
And yes,
I come from a good family.

58:36.125 --> 58:37.958
But Esmeralda? It's a cliché.

58:38.125 --> 58:40.750
At least I'm not some moron
who punches trees.

58:40.916 --> 58:41.958
Finished, Esmé?

58:42.333 --> 58:43.166
Esmé. Better.

58:43.333 --> 58:44.000
Boss,

58:44.166 --> 58:45.791
about the gardener.

58:45.958 --> 58:47.750
A fire is a little tame.

58:47.916 --> 58:50.375
What if we go for
the full firework display?

58:50.875 --> 58:53.541
"A mysterious gardener
slits the family's throats."

58:55.750 --> 58:56.708
I like it.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.208
I'm glad.

58:58.375 --> 59:00.958
I can't deny,
we were getting a little bored.

59:01.125 --> 59:04.166
You know me.
When I'm bored I tend to screw up.

59:04.333 --> 59:06.875
Then you give me hell
and there's a bad vibe.

59:07.041 --> 59:09.291
I'm going to eat
some eggs and turkey.

59:09.458 --> 59:10.833
I'm getting peckish.

59:14.500 --> 59:17.000
You didn't even break your glasses.
Well done.

59:18.375 --> 59:19.791
Hey, thanks.

59:23.666 --> 59:26.083
Burping her always takes forever.

59:26.250 --> 59:27.416
My arms hurt.

59:27.583 --> 59:28.375
May I?

59:28.708 --> 59:29.875
What?

59:38.000 --> 59:39.500
Incredible!

59:40.916 --> 59:42.916
You burped, sweetie!

59:44.541 --> 59:45.375
Good girl.

59:46.750 --> 59:48.958
Hey, your arms
are really something.

59:49.291 --> 59:50.250
Incredible.

59:50.916 --> 59:52.375
Real man's hands.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.666
But soft, too.
That's rare for a gardener.

59:59.458 --> 01:00:01.250
Don't get ideas.
I just like your hands.

01:00:03.541 --> 01:00:05.750
Your hands may be nice
but your ears are not.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.541
Bastard.

01:00:14.666 --> 01:00:15.458
Shit.

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:16.791
He got you too!

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:18.833
I told you the guy was crazy.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:20.750
Hold on.

01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:23.458
We found their hideout.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.958
The gardener was expecting us.

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:28.375
Traps everywhere.

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:31.541
You have one hour to find
the gardener, Shuster and the baby.

01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:33.875
The gardener is wounded.
I hit him.

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:36.875
But this guy is serious.

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:39.041
He's different. Ex-military.

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:40.583
Maybe a marine, who knows?

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.541
He sounds like you.

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:44.958
No brain, just keeps going.
A moron.

01:00:45.125 --> 01:00:46.125
Shut up.

01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:47.958
What about Apastegui's file?

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:50.625
We'll crack it
but it takes time.

01:00:50.791 --> 01:00:51.458
Hurry up.

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:53.208
I want to know my enemy.

01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:55.583
Rome wasn't built in a day.
We'll get there.

01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:01.833
Okay. Gardening time is over.
Switch to live ammo!

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:07.541
Mr. Serge...

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:16.916
Not again. I know you.

01:01:17.083 --> 01:01:20.458
You start a sentence in January
and finish in March! Nope!

01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:22.041
I'm not getting involved.

01:01:22.208 --> 01:01:23.458
Mr. Serge,

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:25.625
I used to live here, before.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:29.375
Okay!

01:01:30.666 --> 01:01:32.166
In the old house...

01:01:33.208 --> 01:01:35.083
I'm starting to get it, now.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:38.666
You didn't have to keep me
in suspense the whole time.

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:40.666
I would hide...

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.416
in the basement.

01:01:42.708 --> 01:01:44.916
You played hide-and-seek?
Nice!

01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:47.333
I rode my bike a lot as a kid.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.791
Not anymore.

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:50.916
Shame. I enjoyed my bike.

01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:57.250
My father was violent.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.250
At least he wasn't too permissive.

01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:06.166
I wasn't there for her.

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:13.916
I don't understand.
What do you mean?

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.875
I mean...

01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:18.916
my mother.

01:02:19.416 --> 01:02:20.541
Okay.

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:24.291
I don't see the connection, but...

01:02:28.875 --> 01:02:30.500
I wasn't there for her.

01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:45.708
I'm sorry, Mr. Serge.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.250
He killed my mother.

01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.208
He killed my mother.

01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:05.125
He killed my mother.

01:03:07.541 --> 01:03:08.791
And I...

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.541
I wasn't there for her.

01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:23.500
That's it.

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:27.666
That's why...

01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:30.541
I don't talk a whole lot.

01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:34.000
And that's why...

01:03:36.291 --> 01:03:38.083
I love flowers,

01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:39.916
trees,

01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:43.291
nature.

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:46.666
I'm comfortable here,

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:48.958
in your garden.

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.708
I'm not alone.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.625
They don't talk either.

01:04:00.208 --> 01:04:02.166
But they give you so much love.

01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:05.458
That's why I'm...

01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:09.041
such a good gardener.

01:04:09.416 --> 01:04:11.416
You're a great gardener.

01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:13.916
It's okay, we'll glue that back.

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:19.250
Now we've talked.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.416
Well done.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:27.750
I care about you, you know.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.041
No tree is alone in a forest.

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:34.833
We are your forest.

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.791
You're not a lonely tree

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.291
with no other trees around you.

01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:43.125
You're a tree in the forest

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:45.458
of the Shuster family.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.750
Thank you, Mr. Serge.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.666
What's happening?
What was that?

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:09.916
- They've executed them!
- No, they haven't.

01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:11.625
How do you know?

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:14.375
- I can hear it.
- Hear it, how?

01:05:15.333 --> 01:05:16.666
They just want to talk.

01:05:28.416 --> 01:05:32.083
Keep the noise down.
I have a baby that's trying to sleep.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:33.541
My little girl.

01:05:33.708 --> 01:05:34.791
She's okay.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.208
Mr. Apastegui.

01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:42.000
Léonidas Apastegui died
30 years ago.

01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:44.666
Obviously... not quite.

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:49.583
Quasimodo, bring me the girl.

01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:54.750
Hold on.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.666
Let go of her!

01:05:56.833 --> 01:05:58.416
Where are you taking her?

01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:00.291
Come on.

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:02.541
- Stop that.
- Get off her!

01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:04.166
Goddamn bitch!

01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:06.083
Give me that. Give it!

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.583
- Leave my family alone!
- You want to play?

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:10.916
The daughter wants to see Daddy!

01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.291
Leave them alone, you bastards!

01:06:13.916 --> 01:06:16.166
I'll handle this one too!

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:17.625
Are you nuts?

01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:21.333
Sorry. They were screaming.
Now they're sleeping.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.125
You want your file, huh?

01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:26.000
Your file?
I'll give you your blasted file!

01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:28.125
Now I'm slapping, I can't stop!

01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:33.916
What? You piece of shit!

01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:39.333
That's better.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.166
- You're crazy!
- Much better.

01:06:41.833 --> 01:06:43.875
Listen, if you go back in there,

01:06:44.041 --> 01:06:45.500
we're all dead.

01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:47.250
All of us.

01:06:47.416 --> 01:06:48.875
Just calm down.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:51.375
This way, grandma.

01:06:51.666 --> 01:06:53.458
Nothing will happen. Trust me.

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:56.416
I can tell you where
the jewels and watches are.

01:06:56.583 --> 01:06:58.583
We're not thieves, ma'am.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.000
You could be my mother.

01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:01.416
Sorry about the slap.

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:02.916
No big deal.

01:07:03.083 --> 01:07:04.958
I still don't know why...

01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:06.958
We won't do anything.
I promise.

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:08.250
Go on, grandma.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.458
Can you protect me?

01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:11.458
Gardener?

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:14.625
If you and Shuster
don't hand yourselves in,

01:07:14.791 --> 01:07:16.833
I'll kill one member of his family

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.291
every 15 minutes.

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:21.041
I'm not part of the family.
I'm not family.

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:22.833
- Then why panic?
- I'm not.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.666
- Why are you panicking? Come here.
- No!

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.583
So, Quasimodo has a heart!

01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:32.875
I thought you Africans were warlike.
We're not in the projects now.

01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:35.500
- Don't be worried.
- I am.

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:37.916
- Shut up!
- Don't be an idiot!

01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:40.166
We work together, brother.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:41.833
Can I go, sir?

01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:43.125
Of course.

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:44.208
Thank you.

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:47.625
Holy cow!

01:07:47.916 --> 01:07:50.041
But I promised the lady.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.458
But hey, beautiful work, Boss.

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:55.375
All that blood!

01:07:55.958 --> 01:07:57.458
It's pissing out!

01:07:57.625 --> 01:07:59.458
Here we go.

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:01.791
We have a new headline.

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:04.125
"A mysterious gardener

01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:07.041
has slit the throat
of his housekeeper."

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:10.291
You're in deep shit, gardener.

01:08:12.666 --> 01:08:14.750
He just wanted to talk, did he?

01:08:15.833 --> 01:08:17.916
You could hear it, could you?

01:08:21.541 --> 01:08:23.416
Time for a nice, long nap.

01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:29.083
With the compost.
Got to move with the times.

01:08:31.583 --> 01:08:33.875
May the Almighty forgive me.

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:35.250
For I have sinned.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.333
Job done!

01:08:45.458 --> 01:08:47.125
They killed Jeanne.

01:08:53.833 --> 01:08:55.833
I've had it.
Hold her for me.

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:58.083
I've had it.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:59.833
Where's your stuff?

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:03.458
Wait, wait. No!

01:09:09.208 --> 01:09:11.833
That shit is so good.
Listen, Léo.

01:09:12.708 --> 01:09:14.125
We have to do something.

01:09:14.291 --> 01:09:16.750
For my wife, for my daughters

01:09:16.916 --> 01:09:18.875
and for your mother.

01:09:19.166 --> 01:09:20.833
Banzai!

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:32.791
What an idiot.

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:42.208
Guten Tag.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.416
60 seconds.

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:44.583
Compliments of the government!

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:47.583
You bloody Nazi!

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:20.916
Papiere, bitte!

01:11:39.291 --> 01:11:40.125
Make him stop!

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
To infinity and beyond!

01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:01.083
What happened?

01:12:01.791 --> 01:12:05.125
No more innocent people
can die today. Got it?

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:07.666
Blink if you understand.

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.375
It's okay.

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:19.625
This game is going
badly for you.

01:12:19.916 --> 01:12:21.458
I have the King.

01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:23.375
You're trapped.

01:12:24.958 --> 01:12:27.708
Mr. Serge has a proposition.

01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:30.416
What is it?

01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:32.208
An exchange.

01:12:32.375 --> 01:12:34.708
Mr. Serge in return for his family.

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:37.916
- Do I have your word?
- You have my word.

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:39.666
He wants to talk to them.

01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:47.458
They're listening.

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:49.291
My loves,

01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:52.375
- I'm going to do what a dad has to do.
- No, my love!

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:54.166
Yes. Now listen.

01:12:54.625 --> 01:12:56.666
This is the only way
so listen closely.

01:12:56.833 --> 01:12:58.208
You have to live.

01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.083
I can go.

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:02.375
Don't do this.

01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:04.375
And I'll go, happy.

01:13:04.916 --> 01:13:07.791
- Happy I shared a life with you.
- We can't live without you!

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:10.708
I'm sorry for everything I did.
Don't do this!

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:12.500
My little girl...

01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:15.666
There's something
I need you to do.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:19.291
- Just live, and be happy.
- Don't leave me!

01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:22.041
- I'm sorry, Dad!
- Promise me.

01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:26.000
My love.

01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:28.333
When I go,
your smile will be etched

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.958
on my heart.

01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:33.375
The smile that brought
sunshine into my life.

01:13:34.166 --> 01:13:36.541
I don't know how
to live without you.

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:39.458
I'll take care of your daughters.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.958
And tell Charlotte

01:13:42.875 --> 01:13:45.375
that her father
gave his life for you.

01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:47.625
That her father was a hero.

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:49.958
And now,

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.916
he's gone to heaven.

01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:57.083
And he's turned into a star.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.250
A star that shines

01:14:00.416 --> 01:14:02.791
the brightest of all
and is watching over you

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.333
while you sleep.

01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:09.125
Maybe you could say "yoo-hoo!"

01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:10.916
"Yoo-hoo, Daddy!"

01:14:11.375 --> 01:14:12.500
Yoo-hoo?

01:14:12.666 --> 01:14:14.208
Okay, no more yoo-hoos.

01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:16.291
"Yoo-hoo, Daddy!"

01:14:17.041 --> 01:14:18.833
"Yoo-hoo, Daddy."

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:21.666
Adieu.

01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:29.541
Pretty good, right?

01:14:30.875 --> 01:14:32.166
Yeah!

01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:34.041
I thought I was good.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.791
You're being harsh.

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:38.208
I even cried.
That came from the heart.

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:40.375
That's how politics works.

01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:44.375
You put on an act.
For the good of the people, of course.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Let's go.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.250
Can we trust this guy?

01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:50.291
No.

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:53.416
So what will you do?

01:14:53.583 --> 01:14:55.291
Rip up a few weeds.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.250
Scary. But good.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.541
But scary.

01:15:01.708 --> 01:15:03.375
Here, you take her.

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:05.166
For the sake of the mission,

01:15:05.333 --> 01:15:08.541
and also because today,
I'm a little... unpredictable.

01:15:10.666 --> 01:15:12.541
Anyway. Here goes.

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:14.791
Time to make my sacrifice.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:18.666
Ready.

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.000
What are you doing?

01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:27.125
The same thing
as mothers in Africa.

01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:28.250
Good, no?

01:15:28.416 --> 01:15:29.666
It doesn't suit you.

01:15:30.791 --> 01:15:33.125
Sure, I understand
the practical advantages.

01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:36.000
But the mission comes first.

01:15:36.166 --> 01:15:38.208
The mission comes first.
Let's go.

01:15:43.666 --> 01:15:45.458
I've cracked his file.

01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:51.916
This won't be easy.

01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:01.000
We cracked the gardener's file.

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:04.583
He's a big fish, Boss.
The guy's a lunatic.

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:06.291
We should be careful.

01:16:06.916 --> 01:16:08.708
The file is top-secret.

01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:11.250
But I think you'll recognize
what's inside.

01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:21.000
I've been thinking
about your confession, earlier.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.250
I want you to know,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
if you ever need to talk,

01:16:26.166 --> 01:16:28.125
I will always be there to listen.

01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:34.000
You're right.
Sometimes, words are unnecessary.

01:16:34.166 --> 01:16:35.416
I'm learning a lot.

01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:38.916
His file is pretty hardcore.

01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:43.500
Don't you read résumés?

01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:48.291
Sergeant Bohm!

01:16:48.916 --> 01:16:50.625
I should have known it was you.

01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:52.541
Bohm? Who is Bohm?

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.041
You little prick.

01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:56.708
"Léonidas Apastegui"!

01:16:57.083 --> 01:16:58.458
I never knew your real name.

01:16:59.416 --> 01:17:02.708
It's a long way
from Sergeant Léo Bohm,

01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:04.291
my finest soldier.

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:05.625
Five military honors!

01:17:05.958 --> 01:17:07.166
You were like a brother!

01:17:07.333 --> 01:17:10.000
I thought I recognized that voice...

01:17:10.833 --> 01:17:12.041
Commander Masson.

01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:14.125
- Feels weird, right?
- A little.

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:15.833
I'll just go check.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.458
You were my new family.

01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:24.916
But soldiers
who kill innocent people

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:26.500
will never be my brothers.

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:27.791
We had orders,

01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:29.625
and what you did was worse.

01:17:30.416 --> 01:17:31.416
You disobeyed.

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:36.083
Wiping out a tribe of nomads?
You're no leader.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:37.666
That's war!

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:39.458
No, it's not.

01:17:40.666 --> 01:17:42.125
That's a crime.

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.291
And you?
Killing your own men?

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:45.541
What do you call that?

01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:47.500
Some kind of justice.

01:17:48.333 --> 01:17:50.625
Wherever you go, I'll be there.

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.250
If you attack innocent people.

01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:58.583
I'm seeing the bigger picture, now,

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:00.166
and you know what?

01:18:02.333 --> 01:18:03.583
I like it,

01:18:03.916 --> 01:18:05.125
a lot.

01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:08.625
Thank you.

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:40.541
Léo, can you do me a favor?

01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:49.291
Take off your clothes.

01:18:50.541 --> 01:18:51.750
My clothes?

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:53.625
Yeah!

01:19:00.458 --> 01:19:02.000
Where are you going, soldier?

01:19:02.166 --> 01:19:02.916
Where?

01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:05.208
We can't win.
They're too strong.

01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:06.750
Maybe you're right.

01:19:07.125 --> 01:19:08.500
You're a deserter!

01:19:08.666 --> 01:19:09.916
D-E...

01:19:10.083 --> 01:19:12.208
S-E-R-T-E-R!

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:19.208
I can smell you, Playboy.
I know you're close.

01:19:32.416 --> 01:19:34.583
This asshole is hard to find.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.250
What are you doing?
You'll hurt someone.

01:19:41.416 --> 01:19:42.833
That's the point.

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:44.541
No, the wrong person!

01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:46.166
In other words, me.

01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:50.458
That was fast.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:52.166
Now what do I do?

01:20:00.833 --> 01:20:03.625
Are you putting your finger
in my daughter's mouth?

01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:05.250
That finger has killed people!

01:20:05.416 --> 01:20:06.583
You want to live?

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:08.416
Yes, but we can still
be hygienic.

01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:11.666
Watch out.

01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:17.875
So you do karate!

01:20:18.041 --> 01:20:20.333
There are two things I love.
Women and knives.

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:22.958
You're gonna pay for this.

01:20:27.541 --> 01:20:28.958
Really? The baby?

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:31.166
I don't give a shit
about your baby.

01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:37.500
- Don't touch my Rolex!
- Then don't touch the baby.

01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:41.666
He's a bad man.

01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:46.833
You're way too handsome.

01:21:01.458 --> 01:21:02.541
He's just playing.

01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:12.458
Okay, no more playing around.

01:21:14.916 --> 01:21:16.458
Feels good!

01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:19.291
My balls!

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.041
You asshole!

01:21:23.291 --> 01:21:26.458
The party's over.
Time to pack up.

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:29.750
Any last words?

01:21:33.416 --> 01:21:34.625
Esmeralda?

01:21:34.958 --> 01:21:35.958
Such a shitty name.

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:39.041
I saw you in danger
and did the first thing I thought of.

01:21:42.083 --> 01:21:43.375
Is he dead?

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:48.041
For the sake of your own health,
don't move.

01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:49.875
That's advice.

01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:52.333
Not a threat.

01:21:58.583 --> 01:21:59.958
She's fine.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.666
That's the main thing.

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.291
Let's go.

01:22:05.458 --> 01:22:08.250
No! Find a signal,
call the police, and hide.

01:22:08.416 --> 01:22:09.750
- Not without you!
- Go!

01:22:09.916 --> 01:22:12.416
- Come with me!
- It's no use both of us going.

01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:13.958
Listen to me for once.

01:22:14.125 --> 01:22:16.375
I'll stay here
and wait for your dad.

01:22:16.541 --> 01:22:19.000
Go, and if you see Charlotte...

01:22:19.708 --> 01:22:20.875
Of course.

01:22:21.458 --> 01:22:22.791
I'll care for my sister.

01:22:23.458 --> 01:22:24.833
Your little sister.

01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:26.541
You know, I...

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:28.875
I don't hate you.

01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:33.083
I love you too.

01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:35.833
Go, quickly!

01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:05.125
Bohm.

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:07.208
Masson.

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:09.208
Bohm.

01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:10.583
The deal's off.

01:24:11.583 --> 01:24:12.708
You're on your own.

01:24:13.458 --> 01:24:14.708
Give yourself up.

01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:16.166
You know the code.

01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:17.958
Death...

01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:20.000
before dishonor.

01:24:26.041 --> 01:24:27.291
Damn it.

01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:38.041
Sorry, buddy.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.458
But you're probably
already burning in hell.

01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:03.875
I'm going to lay down
my weapons, too.

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:05.250
You take her.

01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:10.375
I'll let you deal with this
for once.

01:25:12.083 --> 01:25:13.500
Careful.

01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:15.583
Good luck.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:19.125
No, I won't say "good luck"
because it brings bad luck.

01:25:19.291 --> 01:25:21.041
Break a leg. I mean...

01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:23.083
Break his leg.

01:25:23.375 --> 01:25:24.375
I mean...

01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:26.541
Break something.

01:25:27.625 --> 01:25:29.750
Especially if it's his ugly face.

01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:46.708
Blind obedience...

01:25:47.875 --> 01:25:49.000
that's your thing.

01:25:49.166 --> 01:25:51.083
I was born to obey.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:54.625
I chose to disobey.

01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:58.708
For ten years, I've been eliminating
people on the Matignon List.

01:25:58.875 --> 01:26:01.083
And that will continue,
I promise you.

01:26:06.833 --> 01:26:08.583
I'll teach you to obey, Bohm.

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:20.000
I won't make
the same mistake twice.

01:26:23.583 --> 01:26:24.750
And this?

01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:26.041
Forget this?

01:26:47.083 --> 01:26:48.541
Here's Mommy.

01:26:49.291 --> 01:26:50.666
My darlings!

01:26:51.416 --> 01:26:53.666
I love you.
You saved my little girl.

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:56.166
- Where's Alice?
- Calling the police.

01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:58.750
- I knew you'd come back.
- It's over.

01:26:58.916 --> 01:27:01.000
Thank you, thank you.

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:02.333
It's over.

01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:05.416
You were ready
to sacrifice yourself!

01:27:05.583 --> 01:27:08.166
No! That was
psychological manipulation.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.083
Special Forces technique.

01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:12.541
What?

01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:17.625
Uh...
Of course, I would have if I had to.

01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:19.666
Just not this time.

01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:22.625
- What's that?
- That's...

01:27:23.166 --> 01:27:23.958
war.

01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:25.625
Dad!

01:27:25.791 --> 01:27:26.916
My love!

01:27:28.208 --> 01:27:29.208
It's over.

01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:30.333
Mia!

01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:33.916
- Did you call the police?
- No service.

01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:36.333
Not now! Come on, let's go.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.833
And Léo?

01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:41.541
He's busy.

01:28:36.166 --> 01:28:37.458
Crawl...

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.333
like a lowlife gardener.

01:28:47.166 --> 01:28:48.500
This is my turf.

01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:51.166
Cactus.

01:28:54.083 --> 01:28:55.083
Ivy.

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.791
So it's true.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.708
You have no sense of honor.

01:29:44.875 --> 01:29:45.958
No honor.

01:29:47.833 --> 01:29:49.083
Goodbye, Bohm.

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.041
Soldier! Shit!

01:30:00.291 --> 01:30:01.750
The mission is over.

01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:04.000
You follow orders, damn it!

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:08.208
It's over. I too chose
the path of disobedience.

01:30:10.583 --> 01:30:11.416
You obey...

01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:04.333
I'm prouder
to have fought you, Bohm,

01:31:04.875 --> 01:31:07.375
than to have followed
Masson's orders.

01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:09.750
Bohm is gone, now.

01:31:10.416 --> 01:31:13.291
I'm just a gardener, that's all.

01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:16.166
No, you're more than that.

01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:19.291
You have to plant new roots, soldier.

01:31:33.958 --> 01:31:35.125
Say...

01:31:36.375 --> 01:31:38.583
aren't you a little tense?

01:31:41.625 --> 01:31:45.041
- At least he won't bother us again.
- No, Mr. Serge.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.083
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:31:48.833 --> 01:31:50.041
I'm fine.

01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:53.083
No kidding.

01:32:03.083 --> 01:32:04.083
What's going on?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
What are you doing?
Come on!

01:32:07.166 --> 01:32:09.208
I'm not really a city person.

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:11.291
What will you do here?

01:32:11.541 --> 01:32:13.708
What I do best. Disappear.

01:32:14.333 --> 01:32:15.958
And garden.

01:32:21.833 --> 01:32:22.833
Thanks, Léo.

01:32:24.375 --> 01:32:26.000
You saved our lives.

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.500
From the bottom of my heart.

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:33.416
You take care.

01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:36.291
I'm going to blow
this case wide open.

01:32:36.916 --> 01:32:37.958
Come on.

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:40.125
The baby. I know it was you.

01:32:42.375 --> 01:32:43.791
We worked as a team.

01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:48.291
Thank you.

01:34:07.833 --> 01:34:09.041
Masson...

01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:23.625
Is she asleep?

01:34:25.583 --> 01:34:26.833
No music, either!

01:34:30.541 --> 01:34:33.000
Didn't I tell you
I filmed something crazy?

01:34:33.166 --> 01:34:37.041
For ten years, I've been eliminating
people on the Matignon List.

01:34:37.208 --> 01:34:39.875
- And that will continue...
- You didn't!

01:34:40.166 --> 01:34:41.625
- When was this?
- In the garden.

01:34:41.791 --> 01:34:42.833
Nice work!

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.750
The file, and this video?

01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:46.666
It's the scoop of the century.

01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:48.333
Impressive!

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.375
Happy, Mrs. Journalist?

01:34:50.541 --> 01:34:53.416
Chief Editor. I'll shut them down.
I'll email the paper.

01:34:59.208 --> 01:35:01.333
Can you drive smoothly?
I can't write.

01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:13.666
Dad?

01:35:13.916 --> 01:35:15.416
Isn't that your car?

01:35:15.583 --> 01:35:17.583
- Where?
- There! Behind us!

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:20.750
My BMW!

01:35:20.916 --> 01:35:21.916
It's accelerating.

01:35:32.833 --> 01:35:34.583
- Go faster!
- I am!

01:35:35.583 --> 01:35:37.583
Be careful!
I've got Charlotte on my lap!

01:35:48.875 --> 01:35:50.791
- Hold onto her!
- I've got her.

01:35:50.958 --> 01:35:52.791
He's going to total my car!

01:35:52.958 --> 01:35:54.041
And kill us!

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.041
Watch it!

01:35:57.208 --> 01:35:59.541
- Yeah, watch it!
- You want me to watch it?

01:36:00.041 --> 01:36:01.708
Send the damn email!

01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:04.458
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:06.375
- The baby?
- I caught her.

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.291
- He's passing us!
- Stop!

01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:22.583
He's passing us!

01:36:23.791 --> 01:36:24.625
Move!

01:36:25.875 --> 01:36:26.875
Pull over!

01:36:27.041 --> 01:36:28.416
You pull over!

01:36:29.958 --> 01:36:30.791
Pull over!

01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:31.958
No, never!

01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:46.375
Quick!

01:36:48.541 --> 01:36:49.583
Shit!

01:36:51.458 --> 01:36:52.666
- No!
- Yes!

01:36:58.708 --> 01:36:59.791
There!

01:37:00.875 --> 01:37:03.291
Léo may be the expert
in hand-to-hand combat

01:37:03.458 --> 01:37:05.583
but off-road, Daddy knows best!

01:37:12.166 --> 01:37:15.291
- He's back, he's back!
- I don't believe this!

01:37:31.083 --> 01:37:33.250
Send your email, damn it!

01:37:33.416 --> 01:37:35.250
- Where's my phone?
- Find it!

01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:43.208
Dad, Léo's here! We're saved!

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.208
Bohm!

01:37:55.666 --> 01:37:57.208
He just won't leave me alone.

01:38:02.416 --> 01:38:03.083
Shit!

01:38:04.708 --> 01:38:05.375
Bastard!

01:38:32.875 --> 01:38:33.791
Where is he?

01:38:43.166 --> 01:38:45.166
You should have obeyed, Bohm.

01:38:46.625 --> 01:38:47.875
Stay here.

01:38:48.166 --> 01:38:49.208
All three of you.

01:38:49.375 --> 01:38:50.500
Are you crazy?

01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:55.458
Be careful.

01:39:03.708 --> 01:39:04.791
Hey.

01:39:05.208 --> 01:39:07.583
Seems this game
is missing a player.

01:39:10.875 --> 01:39:12.875
It's not a threesome
without Sergio.

01:39:20.541 --> 01:39:21.708
Say,

01:39:21.875 --> 01:39:23.791
don't you have a mission
to complete?

01:39:26.083 --> 01:39:28.416
You need to complete the mission.

01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:30.541
Remember what they say
in the army?

01:39:30.916 --> 01:39:33.916
Every mission must be completed

01:39:34.083 --> 01:39:36.708
The mission, the mission!

01:39:36.875 --> 01:39:38.458
Come on, then!

01:39:38.625 --> 01:39:40.541
I bet you're confused, right now.

01:39:41.083 --> 01:39:42.541
Vengeance? The mission?

01:39:42.708 --> 01:39:43.916
Vengeance? Mission?

01:39:47.875 --> 01:39:49.750
Finish your mission, damn it.

01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:51.708
Here's your mission! Yeah.

01:39:52.458 --> 01:39:54.958
But your mission?
He's Mohammed Ali.

01:39:55.291 --> 01:39:57.416
Float like a butterfly...

01:39:59.666 --> 01:40:00.583
See?

01:40:00.958 --> 01:40:02.500
That was close!

01:40:06.541 --> 01:40:07.375
You're out.

01:40:08.916 --> 01:40:10.208
Come on, then.

01:40:10.375 --> 01:40:12.166
Come and fight.

01:40:13.416 --> 01:40:14.666
Let's finish this,

01:40:15.166 --> 01:40:16.458
one-on-one.

01:40:17.416 --> 01:40:19.000
Float like a butterfly,

01:40:19.666 --> 01:40:20.625
sting like a bee!

01:40:45.291 --> 01:40:46.500
Masson.

01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:49.375
Nature forgives...

01:40:53.208 --> 01:40:54.541
But not me.

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.166
Very poetic.

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:05.041
Nice work!

01:41:05.916 --> 01:41:07.625
You're lucky I distracted him.

01:41:08.333 --> 01:41:10.500
We make a great team,
don't you think?

01:41:10.666 --> 01:41:11.916
My love!

01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:13.666
Dad!

01:41:13.833 --> 01:41:16.208
You did great.
I'm proud of you.

01:41:18.291 --> 01:41:19.291
Going to thank me?

01:41:20.208 --> 01:41:20.958
Thank you.

01:41:23.416 --> 01:41:24.708
You're welcome.

01:41:27.958 --> 01:41:28.958
What's he doing?

01:41:29.375 --> 01:41:30.541
Where's he going?

01:41:31.791 --> 01:41:33.916
- Léo!
- What are you doing?

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.250
You're not saying goodbye?

01:41:44.208 --> 01:41:45.500
Goodbye.

01:41:49.166 --> 01:41:50.750
He's a smart guy.

01:41:51.166 --> 01:41:54.083
It's good to keep things short
and to the point.

01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:55.958
- I wonder if...
- Shut up.

01:41:58.291 --> 01:42:00.041
I love you too.

01:42:23.333 --> 01:42:25.916
A new twist in the Matignon case

01:42:26.083 --> 01:42:28.458
as Prime Minister
Georges-François Balfen

01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:31.041
has been placed
in detention pending trial

01:42:31.208 --> 01:42:33.375
at the Prison de la Santé
this morning.

01:42:33.541 --> 01:42:36.500
The arrest marks
a turning point in the scandal...

01:42:37.166 --> 01:42:39.708
That's right.
Your daddy is an unsung hero.

01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:19.583
THE GARDENER

01:44:16.291 --> 01:44:17.541
Hello, sir.

01:44:17.708 --> 01:44:20.125
- Where do I park my bike?
- You can't, sir.

01:44:20.291 --> 01:44:22.916
- But I'm Serge Shuster.
- Serge...

01:44:23.083 --> 01:44:25.000
Shuster.
The Environment Minister.

01:44:25.458 --> 01:44:27.708
Mr. Chassagnol is
Environment Minister.

01:44:27.875 --> 01:44:31.458
Not anymore.
Now I'm the Environment Minister.

01:44:31.625 --> 01:44:32.625
Is there a problem?

01:44:32.791 --> 01:44:34.916
He says
he's the Environment Minister.

01:44:35.083 --> 01:44:36.708
That's Mr. Chassagnol.

01:44:37.166 --> 01:44:38.625
Until 10 a.m.

01:44:38.791 --> 01:44:41.083
I'm being inducted today.

01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:44.416
As of 10 a.m.
I'm the new Environment Minister.

01:44:44.583 --> 01:44:47.125
Mr. Chassagnol
is Environment Minister.

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:48.583
Excuse me.

01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:49.666
Hey, Didier.

01:44:50.083 --> 01:44:51.916
So Didier just walks on in?

01:44:52.666 --> 01:44:53.666
He works here.

01:44:53.833 --> 01:44:56.791
Yes, and I'd like to go inside
and work here, too.

01:44:56.958 --> 01:44:57.958
Any ID?

01:44:59.125 --> 01:45:01.541
Really?
I'm not happy about this.

01:45:02.708 --> 01:45:04.750
Here. Serge Shuster.

01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:07.875
Shuster, Shuster...

01:45:09.458 --> 01:45:11.333
Sorry, you're not on the list.

01:45:11.833 --> 01:45:15.083
For once,
that's actually good to hear.
