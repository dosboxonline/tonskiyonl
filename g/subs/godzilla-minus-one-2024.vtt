WEBVTT

01:18.681 --> 01:19.516
Ready?

01:19.766 --> 01:21.017
- One, two...
- One, two...

01:23.686 --> 01:24.729
There's nothing wrong with the engine.

01:24.729 --> 01:25.647
Roger.

01:26.314 --> 01:27.190
And no issues with the fuel line.

01:27.190 --> 01:28.149
Understood.

01:36.533 --> 01:37.784
Ensign Shikishima, right?

01:39.744 --> 01:41.746
I was a mechanic at the
Tsukuba Naval Air Corps.

01:41.746 --> 01:42.831
Tachibana.

01:42.831 --> 01:44.082
We were there at the same time.

01:44.666 --> 01:45.416
Tachibana?

01:45.416 --> 01:46.334
Oh-

01:46.501 --> 01:47.627
Of course, yes.

01:47.627 --> 01:48.878
I owe you, and your men.

01:51.381 --> 01:53.508
This runway of ours is
chock full of holes,

01:54.008 --> 01:55.927
and you were still able to land safely.

01:57.262 --> 01:59.556
You haven't lost your
touch since we last met.

01:59.931 --> 02:01.933
Well, training for dogfights was simple.

02:02.517 --> 02:04.519
It's a different in a real Kamikaze.

02:06.729 --> 02:07.981
Yes it is.

02:08.106 --> 02:10.567
Lucky you got this
extra chance to rest, huh?

02:13.278 --> 02:14.195
It's strange.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.573
Your rig, we looked it over.

02:16.573 --> 02:19.284
And not a single one of us
could pin down any issues.

02:22.996 --> 02:24.330
What are you trying to say?

02:48.271 --> 02:49.105
I'm on your side.

02:50.315 --> 02:51.733
We need more people like you.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.992
I just don't see what the point is.

03:01.576 --> 03:04.746
We know how this war's gonna
end, so why "die honorably" now?

04:00.885 --> 04:01.761
Get the guns!

04:01.761 --> 04:02.887
- Yes, Sir!
- Roger!

04:04.389 --> 04:05.431
Is it a raid?

04:05.431 --> 04:07.100
- I don't know!
- What do you mean?

04:07.100 --> 04:08.559
We can't see, it's too dark!

04:08.559 --> 04:09.936
Is it the Americans again?

04:15.525 --> 04:16.359
Taki!

04:16.776 --> 04:17.610
Taki!

04:18.278 --> 04:19.654
Get a light on it!

04:19.654 --> 04:20.571
Roger!

04:33.668 --> 04:35.753
- Taki!
- Taki-san.

04:36.170 --> 04:37.380
What the hell is that thing?

04:37.380 --> 04:38.589
It's called Godzilla.

04:38.589 --> 04:41.009
- What's Godzilla?
- One of the locals told me.

04:41.009 --> 04:42.885
When deep sea fish float like today,

04:43.177 --> 04:44.470
Godzilla is near.

04:44.470 --> 04:45.388
G-Godzilla?

04:52.145 --> 04:53.062
We're done for.

04:53.813 --> 04:54.647
Go!

04:54.814 --> 04:56.232
- Take cover!
- Go! Get in the trenches!

04:56.232 --> 04:57.150
Now!

04:57.525 --> 04:58.359
Go on!

04:58.776 --> 04:59.652
It's gonna eat us!

05:03.239 --> 05:04.115
Hurry! Hurry!

05:04.115 --> 05:05.116
Come on.

05:08.077 --> 05:09.454
What the hell is that thing?

05:10.121 --> 05:11.372
No one knows what it is.

05:13.207 --> 05:14.375
I have an idea.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.376
What is it?

05:16.586 --> 05:18.671
Think you can reach your
twenty millimeter gun?

05:19.464 --> 05:21.215
You're the only one
who knows how to shoot.

05:21.215 --> 05:22.383
We're just mechanics.

05:23.176 --> 05:24.344
It's gigantic.

05:24.344 --> 05:25.261
What if it doesn't work

05:25.261 --> 05:26.471
and it just makes it angrier?

05:26.471 --> 05:29.015
A twenty millimeter gun's
enough to kill anything!

05:29.849 --> 05:30.767
Now go, hurry.

05:30.767 --> 05:32.226
It's still heading this way.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.394
Hurry!

05:33.978 --> 05:35.146
Get out there!

05:35.146 --> 05:36.064
Go!

05:37.398 --> 05:38.232
Hurry!

05:51.954 --> 05:52.830
Get in.

06:07.678 --> 06:09.138
What, does he need an invitation?

06:16.687 --> 06:18.231
Come on! Shoot!

06:31.994 --> 06:33.204
It's still coming!

06:34.914 --> 06:36.082
What do we do, Tachibana?!

06:36.082 --> 06:37.250
We need ammo!

06:37.250 --> 06:38.334
Go, get some rounds.

06:45.716 --> 06:46.259
You idiots!

06:47.176 --> 06:47.844
Don't shoot!

06:48.428 --> 06:49.303
What are you doing?

06:50.304 --> 06:51.055
Cease fire now!

06:56.227 --> 06:57.728
Go! Get out!

06:58.396 --> 07:00.148
Get out! Fall back!

07:05.361 --> 07:06.237
Tachibana!

07:13.703 --> 07:14.620
Shoot it!

07:24.547 --> 07:25.715
It's coming this way!

07:32.763 --> 07:33.639
Tomita!

07:46.152 --> 07:47.528
I'll draw it this way.

07:47.528 --> 07:48.529
Shoot to kill!

09:03.062 --> 09:04.814
You boys didn't deserve this.

09:16.409 --> 09:17.243
Hey.

09:20.329 --> 09:21.163
Hey.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.628
Yeah, that's right, take a look.

09:29.797 --> 09:31.173
Everyone is dead!

09:33.593 --> 09:34.427
Huh?

09:34.760 --> 09:36.387
All because you didn't shoot!

09:41.142 --> 09:42.059
Goddamn it!

10:21.057 --> 10:21.891
You.

10:22.975 --> 10:23.809
Hey!

10:45.289 --> 10:46.123
Move.

11:05.518 --> 11:06.936
Make sure it's not too loose.

11:07.478 --> 11:08.354
Got it.

11:08.354 --> 11:11.607
Yeah, that should hold. Okay, lets go.

11:11.607 --> 11:12.566
I know.

11:20.074 --> 11:22.034
Koichi? Is that you?

11:25.663 --> 11:26.580
Oh-Sumiko.

11:27.415 --> 11:28.791
I thought you were dead.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.378
Weren't you a Kamikaze pilot?

11:40.094 --> 11:42.722
You have the nerve to come
back and show your face here?

11:43.723 --> 11:45.349
You disgraced us all!

11:46.767 --> 11:49.270
Take a look around.
Do you see what happened to us

11:49.270 --> 11:50.646
because of cowards like you?

11:53.315 --> 11:55.484
If you'd all done what
you were supposed to do,

11:56.861 --> 11:58.112
I'd still have my kids.

12:08.622 --> 12:10.040
Are my parents alive?

12:10.040 --> 12:11.709
Do you know if they made it out?

12:18.716 --> 12:19.675
Everyone's dead.

12:23.179 --> 12:24.346
During the air raids,

12:24.346 --> 12:26.682
there was fire covering this whole block.

12:29.894 --> 12:30.811
Your parents are dead.

12:30.811 --> 12:32.021
Along with everyone.

12:34.815 --> 12:37.485
Including my children,
who met the very same fate.

12:51.165 --> 12:54.001
MY DEAREST SON, KOICHI...

12:55.920 --> 12:57.338
"Return to us alive."

13:01.217 --> 13:02.551
Isn't that what you wanted?

13:16.273 --> 13:17.483
How is it?

13:17.483 --> 13:19.026
- Would you care to take a look?
- Good to see you.

13:19.026 --> 13:20.486
Stop! Stop, thief!

13:21.695 --> 13:22.571
Out of my way!

13:22.571 --> 13:23.614
Move! Move!

13:23.614 --> 13:24.615
Let me through!

13:24.615 --> 13:25.533
Ah!

13:25.658 --> 13:27.868
- Grab that woman! Right there! Quick!
- Hold on.

13:30.204 --> 13:30.955
Take this!

13:30.955 --> 13:32.414
- What?
- Wait! That's her! Stop right there!

13:32.414 --> 13:33.916
- Catch that woman!
- Get back here!

13:33.916 --> 13:35.125
Down there! That's it!

13:35.125 --> 13:36.126
There! That's the woman!

13:36.418 --> 13:38.128
Go left, I'll cut her off. Move!
What are you doing? Out of my way!

13:38.128 --> 13:39.129
What on Earth?

13:44.301 --> 13:46.720
- Good evening. Is your family alright?
- Oh, yes, we're doing fine.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.265
- Good.
- Well, considering.

13:49.265 --> 13:51.642
- Give everyone my best.
- Yes, good to see you.

13:51.892 --> 13:52.726
Hello.

13:55.354 --> 13:57.940
See you later. I'll come
by tomorrow, too. Thank you.

13:57.940 --> 13:59.775
- Okay.
- Take care of yourself. Bye.

13:59.775 --> 14:00.693
Bye.

14:07.783 --> 14:08.701
Hello again!

14:12.913 --> 14:14.665
Thank goodness. Where were you?

14:16.250 --> 14:17.751
Hey, it's your own fault.

14:17.751 --> 14:19.128
I couldn't just go out there.

14:19.128 --> 14:20.296
Too many lookie-loo's.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.799
So you've been here
watching the whole time?

14:24.717 --> 14:27.887
Yeah, and I was starting to get
sick of waiting for you to move.

14:28.137 --> 14:29.054
Wasn't I?

14:30.014 --> 14:31.807
I bet you're hungry now, aren't you?

14:35.102 --> 14:37.730
I thought you'd just leave
her there. Why didn't you?

14:38.522 --> 14:39.356
Hey!

14:41.191 --> 14:44.403
I couldn't leave a baby alone in
the middle of a place like that.

14:46.906 --> 14:47.740
Oh?

14:49.742 --> 14:50.910
Oh really?

14:54.747 --> 14:56.498
Could you please stop following me?

14:57.166 --> 15:00.002
But we'll die on the street
if you leave us out here alone.

15:00.002 --> 15:00.878
Why would I care?

15:07.092 --> 15:09.511
After you're done eating,
would you please leave?

15:10.095 --> 15:11.347
Oh, you hear that?

15:11.347 --> 15:13.057
He's so mean and scary, isn't he?

15:17.102 --> 15:18.520
Where's your husband, anyway?

15:19.313 --> 15:20.564
Did he fight in the war?

15:22.024 --> 15:23.025
What a question.

15:23.025 --> 15:24.860
Does it look like I have a husband?

15:25.110 --> 15:25.945
What?

15:26.779 --> 15:27.655
Whose kid is she?

15:29.698 --> 15:31.033
Does it matter?

15:31.033 --> 15:32.326
Of course it matters.

15:36.497 --> 15:38.248
It was during one of the air raids.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.710
Her dying mother asked me to take her.

15:44.213 --> 15:45.047
So,

15:45.965 --> 15:47.299
are you saying

15:47.299 --> 15:48.509
you're not related to her?

15:49.760 --> 15:50.761
No. So what?

15:53.973 --> 15:55.265
Are you insane?

15:56.225 --> 15:59.478
You have no business trying to take
care of a baby in the state you're in.

15:59.478 --> 16:01.438
You're one to talk. You
couldn't leave her either.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.356
Hey!

16:08.946 --> 16:09.738
What's her name?

16:13.325 --> 16:14.159
AKIKO

16:16.912 --> 16:18.038
And what do I call you?

16:20.833 --> 16:21.709
Noriko.

16:25.045 --> 16:27.047
Why do you go around dressed like that?

16:27.047 --> 16:29.591
You look like you spend
your days begging for money.

16:30.175 --> 16:31.844
Am I supposed to be a whore instead?

16:31.844 --> 16:33.262
That's not what I said, but

16:35.097 --> 16:36.598
we're all trying to survive.

16:36.598 --> 16:38.767
If you were, I wouldn't
think any less of you.

16:44.940 --> 16:45.858
Any family?

16:56.243 --> 16:57.077
Your parents?

17:02.166 --> 17:03.000
Yeah.

17:04.710 --> 17:05.627
They were killed.

17:06.754 --> 17:07.671
In the air raids.

17:12.384 --> 17:14.136
So you're by yourself now, as well.

17:33.822 --> 17:34.656
Huh?

17:35.282 --> 17:36.116
What?

17:36.366 --> 17:37.367
You can't stay here.

17:38.702 --> 17:40.120
Are you kidding me?

17:54.176 --> 17:55.010
Hey!

17:57.596 --> 17:58.806
What's the story, huh?

18:00.724 --> 18:01.892
What story?

18:01.892 --> 18:03.268
Don't play dumb with me.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.730
That mother and child
you took in last night.

18:07.147 --> 18:09.566
What, so now you think
you're some kind of saint?

18:11.610 --> 18:13.403
I didn't even want them to stay.

18:14.530 --> 18:17.366
What difference does that
make? You didn't kick them out.

18:21.703 --> 18:23.580
It's too late to play the hero.

18:25.749 --> 18:26.917
I see right through you.

18:27.835 --> 18:29.419
Don't bother asking me for help.

18:34.925 --> 18:35.676
Wait.

18:37.427 --> 18:38.470
The girl.

18:38.470 --> 18:40.139
Do you know if she can breastfeed?

18:41.932 --> 18:42.850
No, she's-

18:43.433 --> 18:44.351
The child

18:45.060 --> 18:46.603
she isn't the mother.

18:47.938 --> 18:48.939
What are you saying?

18:49.773 --> 18:50.899
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

18:51.608 --> 18:52.442
Hm?

18:53.026 --> 18:53.861
Mm.

18:54.278 --> 18:55.112
Mm.

18:56.697 --> 18:57.614
There you go.

19:01.785 --> 19:04.830
If you keep feeding her like
this she'll die of malnutrition.

19:05.289 --> 19:06.123
Right?

19:07.207 --> 19:08.041
Ah.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.920
So you take in a child, but you
have no idea how to care for it.

19:12.754 --> 19:13.881
What were you thinking?

19:15.465 --> 19:16.383
I'm not sure.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.518
This isn't for either of you.

19:28.103 --> 19:29.938
Adults can survive on anything.

19:35.903 --> 19:37.571
Use it to make gruel for the baby.

19:38.906 --> 19:39.907
Ah well.

19:40.699 --> 19:42.826
There goes all of my prized white rice.

19:44.703 --> 19:46.121
Pains in the neck, those two.

19:58.258 --> 19:59.760
Agh. Damn it.

20:00.427 --> 20:01.637
It's pouring out there.

20:03.180 --> 20:04.056
I'm soaked.

20:08.727 --> 20:10.229
Did you find any work?

20:10.229 --> 20:11.146
Well,

20:11.605 --> 20:12.689
actually,

20:12.689 --> 20:14.024
I did find something but-

20:14.816 --> 20:15.901
Well that's good news.

20:17.819 --> 20:19.321
The money's not bad, either.

20:20.197 --> 20:21.490
Here, look.

20:21.490 --> 20:23.033
See what it says there?

20:23.033 --> 20:24.368
There's an advance of three thousand yen.

20:24.368 --> 20:25.744
That's great isn't it?

20:30.832 --> 20:32.000
It can't be real though.

20:32.542 --> 20:35.420
You remember that other job
where all our rice got stolen?

20:35.921 --> 20:36.797
It's not like that.

20:36.797 --> 20:38.298
Things are different this time.

20:38.298 --> 20:40.384
How can you know that for sure, though?

20:40.384 --> 20:42.844
'Cause this one's got
the government backing it.

20:43.637 --> 20:45.681
And... it pays this well for a good reason.

20:46.390 --> 20:47.683
What reason?

20:47.683 --> 20:48.684
During the war,

20:49.893 --> 20:53.021
both the US and Imperial
navies laid thousands of mines, and

20:54.273 --> 20:55.649
they need us to clear them out.

20:57.651 --> 20:59.152
They're offering so much money

21:00.362 --> 21:01.238
because

21:03.949 --> 21:04.866
this work,

21:05.617 --> 21:06.535
it carries

21:06.535 --> 21:07.744
a certain kind of risk.

21:09.913 --> 21:11.456
Listen to what you're saying!

21:11.456 --> 21:13.417
You can't do this,
you just survived a war.

21:13.417 --> 21:14.793
It's not exactly a choice!

21:15.460 --> 21:17.671
We won't make it if
something doesn't change.

21:17.921 --> 21:19.047
Akiko will starve to death.

21:21.091 --> 21:22.384
I understand that, but,

21:23.010 --> 21:24.011
I can't let you go.

21:25.429 --> 21:26.263
Look.

21:26.471 --> 21:27.639
This'll bring in money.

21:28.724 --> 21:29.933
And with it, we can buy

21:29.933 --> 21:32.686
American powdered milk, or anything else.

21:32.686 --> 21:33.687
If that means that I-

21:34.688 --> 21:36.315
I can't let that happen to you!

21:40.902 --> 21:41.820
Listen to me.

21:42.946 --> 21:44.197
Just cause this is risky,

21:44.448 --> 21:45.949
it doesn't mean that I'll die.

21:47.326 --> 21:49.453
This isn't like the
war, it's not hopeless.

21:54.666 --> 21:55.542
Anyway,

21:56.168 --> 21:59.796
they said they use boats that are
specially made to evade magnetic mines.

22:04.551 --> 22:05.469
This is it?

22:06.136 --> 22:07.471
This is specially made?

22:21.943 --> 22:24.654
Hey there. Are you our new sharpshooter?

22:24.654 --> 22:25.655
Shikishima, yes.

22:25.655 --> 22:26.740
Ex-Navy?

22:27.157 --> 22:29.493
- I flew a fighter actually.
- What the hell?

22:29.493 --> 22:30.452
What do we do with this guy?

22:30.452 --> 22:33.121
- An airman? You saw action didn't you?
- He's a military castoff.

22:33.121 --> 22:34.790
Not worth anything to us.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.249
Are you disappointed

22:37.084 --> 22:38.668
that we're using this old thing?

22:39.836 --> 22:41.338
Well, during the course of the war,

22:41.338 --> 22:44.674
the US and Imperial navies laid nearly
sixty thousand mines of all sorts off

22:44.674 --> 22:46.051
the coasts of Japan, but

22:46.051 --> 22:48.929
the ones that worry us are
the American magnetic kind.

22:49.513 --> 22:51.264
If a vessel made out
of metal goes anywhere

22:51.264 --> 22:53.350
near one of those, a blast is triggered.

22:55.310 --> 22:56.144
Ah.

22:56.937 --> 22:58.021
- Hence the wood.
- Mhm.

22:58.563 --> 22:59.856
You catch on pretty quick.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.110
Most of what we can handle
are the standard moored mines.

23:03.110 --> 23:04.361
But with the magnetic ones,

23:04.361 --> 23:06.571
wooden boats are the best countermeasure.

23:09.366 --> 23:09.950
Noda's the name.

23:11.243 --> 23:14.621
During the war, I worked for a
while designing weapons for the navy.

23:15.163 --> 23:16.081
That's our captain,

23:16.081 --> 23:18.333
- Akitsu, and that's Mizushima there.
- You can call this one

23:18.333 --> 23:19.292
"Kid" and he's "Doc."

23:19.292 --> 23:21.753
I'm not very fond of that
nickname, and you know that.

23:21.753 --> 23:23.713
And I'm way too old for "kid" now, okay?

23:23.713 --> 23:26.299
Sure, but seeing as you're the
greenest one, you're still "Kid."

23:26.299 --> 23:29.261
Agh, yeah I know. I didn't get to
fight in the war like you, I was too

23:29.261 --> 23:30.178
young.

23:30.637 --> 23:31.847
Our minesweeper here is
called the Shinseimaru,

23:31.847 --> 23:34.433
that's the Kaishinmaru parked there.

23:34.433 --> 23:38.770
The mines we're after are tethered to
the seabed like balloons on strings.

23:39.438 --> 23:43.567
So we run a cable between our two
boats, with a cutter in the middle.

23:43.567 --> 23:47.988
All we have to do is clip the tether,
and the mine floats to the surface.

23:48.655 --> 23:50.115
Then, we hit it with this.

23:51.491 --> 23:52.701
Da-da-da-da-da- dada!

23:53.910 --> 23:54.828
Let me show you.

24:06.756 --> 24:08.508
This one's a little bit squirrelly.

24:09.009 --> 24:10.093
Could you let me try?

24:11.219 --> 24:12.637
You think you can handle her?

24:14.222 --> 24:15.056
Here.

24:17.559 --> 24:19.060
Since we're rocking like this,

24:19.519 --> 24:22.856
I'm trying to account for how the
waves are also moving the target.

24:29.905 --> 24:31.156
Whoa- hoa!

24:32.782 --> 24:33.825
Nice one!

24:34.534 --> 24:36.369
I learned how to shoot down fighters.

24:36.369 --> 24:38.788
But I never saw real
action, just simulations.

24:38.788 --> 24:39.706
What?

24:40.749 --> 24:42.375
You never saw any real action?

24:43.084 --> 24:45.128
I guess Shikishima is
just as green as me, huh?

24:45.128 --> 24:48.006
Hey. Learn how to fly a plane
like he can, then we can talk.

24:48.006 --> 24:50.926
If I'd fought in the war I
know I'd have been useful too.

24:51.468 --> 24:52.302
Ah.

24:52.427 --> 24:53.970
If only it had just kept on going.

24:56.806 --> 24:58.767
Don't say anything like that ever again.

25:02.103 --> 25:03.188
It was just a joke.

25:07.234 --> 25:08.360
Use your brain, kid.

25:34.594 --> 25:35.929
- Fall back!
- Stop it there!

25:36.179 --> 25:37.430
- Fire!
- Fall back!

25:39.099 --> 25:39.933
Fire!

25:40.308 --> 25:40.934
- Help!
- Fall back!

25:40.934 --> 25:41.643
Go, go!

25:59.160 --> 26:00.078
You alright?

26:01.580 --> 26:02.414
Oh.

26:07.794 --> 26:08.962
Another nightmare?

26:17.304 --> 26:18.221
Nightmare?

26:22.100 --> 26:23.018
That's right.

26:24.769 --> 26:25.604
I was

26:25.770 --> 26:26.688
dreaming.

26:34.112 --> 26:35.030
What if...

26:36.823 --> 26:37.866
You, here.

26:37.866 --> 26:38.867
That's the dream?

26:39.618 --> 26:40.702
I don't understand you.

26:40.702 --> 26:42.120
- Are you sure-
- Is this?

26:42.120 --> 26:43.747
We're in Japan, right?

26:43.747 --> 26:44.664
Right?

26:45.040 --> 26:46.333
I made it back alive. I came back right?

26:46.333 --> 26:47.250
Right?

26:47.417 --> 26:49.336
- I made it back alive, right?
- Get off!

27:10.440 --> 27:11.358
Right, I know.

27:12.317 --> 27:13.193
I know.

27:15.362 --> 27:16.237
I know.

28:23.430 --> 28:25.682
You've built a real nice place here.

28:25.682 --> 28:27.475
I'd say it's worth every penny saved.

28:29.644 --> 28:30.478
Mmm.

28:33.064 --> 28:34.274
- Mmm.
- Would would you like more?

28:34.274 --> 28:35.483
- Oh, ho ho.
- Ah.

28:35.483 --> 28:36.484
Yes please. Thanks.

28:38.903 --> 28:39.738
Ah.

28:39.863 --> 28:41.030
- How about a photo?
- Ah.

28:41.030 --> 28:41.948
Oh?

28:42.240 --> 28:43.241
- Ooh.
- Oh no.

28:43.241 --> 28:44.868
- Please don't waste your film on me.
- Ahh,

28:44.868 --> 28:46.035
look at that smile!

28:46.035 --> 28:47.078
Hold it.

28:47.078 --> 28:48.663
- Hold it.
- Very nice.

28:48.663 --> 28:49.539
And-

28:52.292 --> 28:53.710
- Thank you.
- Watch out, Doc.

28:53.710 --> 28:55.545
- Don't go falling for Noriko now.
- He's right.

28:55.545 --> 28:57.088
Hey, you shouldn't joke like that.

28:57.088 --> 28:59.549
Noriko's a married woman after all.

28:59.549 --> 29:01.176
Everyone, please that's enough!

29:01.176 --> 29:02.719
I'm not his wife.

29:06.431 --> 29:07.265
She's not?

29:08.558 --> 29:10.226
Yeah, she just showed up one day.

29:10.935 --> 29:12.353
She had nowhere else to go.

29:12.353 --> 29:13.271
So,

29:13.813 --> 29:14.856
I let her stay.

29:14.856 --> 29:15.940
And the little girl?

29:16.399 --> 29:17.859
She brough Akiko with her.

29:17.859 --> 29:20.403
But they're not related
to each other. Not really.

29:20.612 --> 29:21.946
She was an orphan that

29:21.946 --> 29:23.823
Noriko took in during the air raids.

29:25.742 --> 29:26.951
You all found each other.

29:26.951 --> 29:27.786
What a lovely story.

29:28.995 --> 29:30.580
That's just sort of how it went.

29:33.541 --> 29:34.375
Daddy.

29:37.003 --> 29:37.837
Akiko.

29:38.046 --> 29:38.880
Yeah?

29:40.048 --> 29:41.049
I told you.

29:41.049 --> 29:42.759
You know I'm not your father.

29:45.178 --> 29:46.304
Oh, Shikishima.

29:47.013 --> 29:50.433
- That's awful. How could you say that?
- What a hurtful thing to say.

29:50.892 --> 29:52.101
Here's the thing:

29:52.101 --> 29:54.479
Fate has brought you together as a family.

29:55.188 --> 29:56.898
You need to find a way to accept that.

29:56.898 --> 29:59.234
That's right, and now I need a hug.

30:00.276 --> 30:01.361
- Yeah.
- That's enough!

30:02.529 --> 30:03.613
I don't want that.

30:09.994 --> 30:10.912
Why not?

30:26.678 --> 30:27.762
Welcome home.

30:27.762 --> 30:29.347
I just got back myself.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.183
What are those clothes you have on?

30:35.353 --> 30:36.271
How do I look?

30:37.146 --> 30:39.232
I went to Ginza and found myself a job.

30:40.608 --> 30:42.485
Is this cause I don't
provide enough for you?

30:48.491 --> 30:51.369
It's not that, I just always
wanted to be self-sufficient.

30:52.704 --> 30:53.872
And you'll never find a wife

30:53.872 --> 30:55.665
if I'm always around.

31:00.086 --> 31:01.129
And, besides.

31:01.129 --> 31:03.506
Ginza's come such a
long way since the war.

31:04.632 --> 31:05.675
This feels so sudden.

31:06.676 --> 31:08.219
I don't really think it is.

31:09.971 --> 31:10.805
Akiko!

31:12.015 --> 31:13.558
What will Akiko do?

31:13.558 --> 31:16.019
Who's going to be here to look after her,

31:16.019 --> 31:17.604
while you go to work in Ginza?

31:18.396 --> 31:21.524
We talked, and Sumiko said
she'd be happy to watch her.

31:21.524 --> 31:22.483
Uh- Oh.

31:23.610 --> 31:24.777
She seemed very excited.

31:24.986 --> 31:27.280
She said "I've already
raised three, why not?"

31:30.491 --> 31:31.326
I see.

31:31.659 --> 31:32.493
Well.

31:32.702 --> 31:33.620
Alright then.

31:34.996 --> 31:37.206
Good, I'll go get Akiko.

31:49.844 --> 31:54.265
Pacific Fleet Destroyer USS Lancaster was
attacked and disabled by an unknown enemy.

31:54.265 --> 31:56.351
No further detail is known at this time.

31:56.893 --> 32:00.563
Intercepted urgent distress call from
Pacific Fleet attack sub USS Redfish,

32:00.563 --> 32:04.150
reporting pursuit of massive undersea
organism through Pacific waters.

32:04.150 --> 32:07.779
After successfully photographing target,
Redfish made contact and was destroyed.

32:07.779 --> 32:10.281
Mayday, mayday. Going down. Wreck
reconnaissance picked up high

32:10.281 --> 32:13.785
radio-isotope emissions where hull
collied with enemy creature skin.

32:18.873 --> 32:22.418
The colossal sea creature is projected
to reach the Japanese archipelago within

32:22.418 --> 32:24.504
a few weeks.
Its recorded movement suggests

32:24.504 --> 32:26.714
a course to the Kanto region, specifically.

32:29.258 --> 32:32.845
General Douglas MacArthur
commented on the developing situation,

32:33.429 --> 32:36.099
stating with regret that
recent Soviet movements

32:36.099 --> 32:38.184
prevent any US military assistance.

32:38.768 --> 32:41.479
He instead calls on Japan
to begin strengthening

32:41.479 --> 32:44.023
its own security forces,
in preparation for potential

32:44.023 --> 32:45.316
contact with the beast.

32:58.538 --> 32:59.747
What could do this?

33:00.957 --> 33:02.417
Some kind of whale?

33:04.085 --> 33:05.336
Or giant shark?

33:05.336 --> 33:06.879
Shark or whale couldn't do that.

33:06.879 --> 33:08.089
No, this is something else.

33:09.424 --> 33:11.009
Maybe a new Soviet weapon?

33:11.009 --> 33:13.094
Does that look like weapon damage to you?

33:13.094 --> 33:14.512
Then what else could it be?

33:15.471 --> 33:16.305
Well,

33:16.514 --> 33:18.766
- My guess would be an enormous creature.
- Oh, come on.

33:18.766 --> 33:21.185
Your crazy theories
aren't any better than ours.

33:21.185 --> 33:22.353
I was skeptical

33:22.353 --> 33:24.313
until I got a closer look at this.

33:26.941 --> 33:27.775
Godzilla.

33:30.570 --> 33:31.696
Look! Starboard side!

33:32.280 --> 33:33.072
Huh?

33:33.656 --> 33:34.282
Huh?

33:35.283 --> 33:37.118
I saw deep sea fish
floating just like this,

33:37.118 --> 33:39.537
the day a monster attacked Odo island.

33:40.204 --> 33:41.122
A monster?

33:41.122 --> 33:42.206
Like what?

33:42.790 --> 33:43.833
It was like a dinosaur.

33:43.833 --> 33:46.461
That over the years had
turned into something else.

33:46.961 --> 33:48.087
I remember hearing that

33:49.172 --> 33:50.673
the locals called it Godzilla.

33:51.674 --> 33:52.800
Godzilla?

33:53.051 --> 33:53.801
Come on.

33:53.801 --> 33:55.178
Don't be ridiculous.

33:55.178 --> 33:58.431
- I bet you just saw a tank that you-
- You can believe me or not.

33:58.639 --> 34:00.475
It still doesn't change the fact that

34:01.267 --> 34:03.519
Godzilla wiped out everyone on Odo Island.

34:04.187 --> 34:05.104
Wait a minute.

34:06.147 --> 34:08.357
I thought the Americans
took out that garrison.

34:10.193 --> 34:11.944
The US island-hopping forces

34:11.944 --> 34:13.571
never targeted Odo.

34:14.280 --> 34:17.992
At that point, it was only being used
as a repair base for kamikaze planes.

34:19.327 --> 34:20.161
Wait, Shikishima.

34:21.704 --> 34:23.456
Does that mean you were a kamikaze pilot?

34:30.046 --> 34:32.423
If this is the same
Godzilla I saw back then,

34:33.299 --> 34:34.217
and it can do this,

34:35.093 --> 34:36.761
then it's even bigger than before.

34:42.767 --> 34:43.893
Just hold on second.

34:44.977 --> 34:46.020
Why are we here?

34:46.020 --> 34:48.439
I don't see how the four
of us can do anything.

34:49.315 --> 34:50.233
I mean how...

34:50.817 --> 34:53.402
they don't honestly expect us
to fight that thing in this.

34:53.402 --> 34:54.612
They obviously do.

34:55.321 --> 34:56.155
What?

34:56.697 --> 34:58.616
But we don't stand a
chance! Not against that!

34:58.616 --> 35:00.910
A big US cruiser couldn't take it down.

35:00.910 --> 35:03.538
We're a couple of planks of
wood, how are we gonna do anything?!

35:03.538 --> 35:05.164
We can distract it for a while.

35:06.499 --> 35:07.416
Are you joking?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.127
Singapore's sending us

35:09.127 --> 35:10.545
the Takao from their docks.

35:11.420 --> 35:12.296
Huh? Wait?

35:12.296 --> 35:13.422
As in the heavy cruiser?

35:13.422 --> 35:14.882
Instead of scuttling it there,

35:14.882 --> 35:16.801
they're going to let us use it again.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.345
Well then that's great!

35:19.345 --> 35:22.056
- The Takao is huge!
- So our orders are to do whatever it

35:22.056 --> 35:24.225
takes to stall for time until it gets
here.

35:24.225 --> 35:26.394
That's an American destroyer.

35:26.394 --> 35:28.229
How come they can't deal with this?

35:28.688 --> 35:29.689
I wouldn't count on it.

35:29.689 --> 35:31.774
It's bad enough with the soviets as is,

35:31.774 --> 35:34.819
the US risks furthering those
tensions if they do anything.

35:35.403 --> 35:36.612
For little things like this,

35:36.612 --> 35:38.698
they'd rather us handle it on our own.

35:38.698 --> 35:39.991
I wouldn't call this little.

35:39.991 --> 35:41.200
And plus, all we've got

35:41.200 --> 35:43.661
- is a thirteen millimeter gun.
- Which is exactly why

35:43.661 --> 35:46.205
they said we should us a
few mines we've recovered.

35:46.873 --> 35:47.707
Ah ha!

35:48.624 --> 35:51.210
That's why we're the ones
that got called out here.

35:51.210 --> 35:52.336
Of course.

35:52.336 --> 35:55.464
They needed a team that could
scavenge their own weapons locally.

35:55.464 --> 35:59.093
They also ordered us not to tell anyone
about the creature or what it is that

35:59.093 --> 36:00.344
we're doing.

36:00.344 --> 36:01.470
And there it is.

36:01.470 --> 36:03.055
Their favorite, the gag order.

36:04.182 --> 36:05.892
This country never changes.

36:07.602 --> 36:08.853
I wonder if it can.

36:18.446 --> 36:19.530
Alright, it's my turn.

36:20.615 --> 36:21.449
Here.

36:22.408 --> 36:23.367
Thank you.

36:24.619 --> 36:26.579
Try not to push
yourself too hard, Shiki-san.

36:27.788 --> 36:30.333
I know, I can't help it if
this really is Godzilla.

36:32.543 --> 36:33.461
I know the feeling.

36:34.462 --> 36:35.338
When I think about

36:35.338 --> 36:37.048
the things that happen in the war

36:38.424 --> 36:40.009
I have a hard time sleeping.

36:41.636 --> 36:42.970
I have to avenge them.

36:43.971 --> 36:45.097
But then I remember

36:46.474 --> 36:48.226
how terrifying that thing was.

36:54.732 --> 36:56.150
We only have a pair of those,

36:56.734 --> 36:58.361
one of which is for an emergency.

37:04.909 --> 37:05.826
What's the matter?

37:24.595 --> 37:25.346
Look at that.

37:25.930 --> 37:28.349
There's way more fish
than there was back on Odo.

37:31.852 --> 37:34.605
Sound the alarm!

37:34.605 --> 37:36.148
Godzilla's gotta be close!

37:36.148 --> 37:37.566
Sound the alarm!

37:39.568 --> 37:41.070
So it's coming, huh?

37:42.154 --> 37:43.155
Hey Kid!

37:43.322 --> 37:44.573
Get ready to drop
those mines in, alright?!

37:44.573 --> 37:45.533
- Roger!
- Shikishima!

37:45.533 --> 37:47.243
- Get on the gun!
- We should retreat.

37:47.243 --> 37:49.245
We don't stand a chance
fighting it like this.

37:49.245 --> 37:51.289
- If we leave now we can make it to land.
- No, we should wait here

37:51.289 --> 37:52.581
and see how it acts first.

37:52.581 --> 37:53.958
Doc, go stand aft and
call out anything you see.

37:53.958 --> 37:56.585
- Captain please!
- Hey Kaishinmaru, you fellas copy?

37:57.128 --> 38:00.047
They say it's gonna show soon.
Get ready to land a big one.

38:00.256 --> 38:03.217
Roger that. Hope you don't
mind us taking all the credit.

38:03.217 --> 38:05.219
- Like hell they will.
- We need to go!

38:05.219 --> 38:07.680
If we run now, the Takao
won't make it in time.

38:07.680 --> 38:08.889
After that,

38:08.889 --> 38:11.017
where do you think this thing's gonna go?

38:11.350 --> 38:14.061
I don't want to see Tokyo
in a sea of fire again.

38:14.061 --> 38:15.021
Listen.

38:15.229 --> 38:16.480
There's no way our ship can handle it!

38:16.480 --> 38:18.733
I thought you said that you hated
the government telling you what to do!

38:18.733 --> 38:20.985
Yeah, this doesn't change that!

38:21.610 --> 38:22.528
The thing is,

38:23.446 --> 38:25.573
if we don't step up,
who the hell's going to?

38:42.506 --> 38:43.382
Actually,

38:43.382 --> 38:44.967
let the Takao handle this one.

38:49.263 --> 38:50.139
Hey Doc,

38:50.139 --> 38:51.265
the engine!

38:51.265 --> 38:52.558
I'm doing my best!

38:52.558 --> 38:53.642
Shikishima!

38:55.436 --> 38:56.312
Shikishima!

38:56.312 --> 38:57.271
Coming.

38:57.521 --> 38:58.356
Hurry!

38:58.606 --> 38:59.523
Help me with this!

39:00.900 --> 39:01.901
Captain!

39:01.901 --> 39:02.902
Yeah, I see it!

39:03.444 --> 39:05.363
- Full throttle ahead!
- Got it!

39:26.258 --> 39:27.968
Get it in the water, now!

39:29.136 --> 39:31.597
It's too close,
there's no way we'll make it!

39:31.597 --> 39:33.224
Drop the goddamn mine, Doc!

39:52.827 --> 39:53.786
Alright, Kid!

39:53.911 --> 39:55.704
- Hit it!
- Get ready boys!

40:01.836 --> 40:02.670
Is it dead?

40:09.260 --> 40:10.761
It's still on our tail!

40:10.761 --> 40:12.555
Oh man oh man oh man oh
man oh man I'm gonna die!

40:12.555 --> 40:14.014
Shikishima,

40:14.432 --> 40:15.433
the gun!

40:15.599 --> 40:16.434
Roger!

40:24.358 --> 40:25.234
Shikishima!

40:36.245 --> 40:37.163
Damn it!

40:37.163 --> 40:38.289
It didn't do anything!

40:42.209 --> 40:43.127
I have an idea,

40:43.836 --> 40:45.379
what if we hit it in the mouth?

40:47.381 --> 40:48.591
Reel! Reel!

40:48.591 --> 40:50.968
Hurry! Quick! Get the line ready!

40:51.760 --> 40:52.761
Drop it!

41:00.144 --> 41:01.395
Mizushima!

41:01.395 --> 41:02.396
Hit the switch!

41:12.490 --> 41:13.282
Hey!

41:13.991 --> 41:14.909
What's wrong?

41:15.743 --> 41:16.577
You're kidding!

41:29.256 --> 41:30.883
You two, get down!

41:45.773 --> 41:46.440
Aagh!

41:54.281 --> 41:55.199
Did it work, Doc?

42:03.832 --> 42:04.625
No!

42:29.775 --> 42:31.569
- It's the Takao!
- They're here.

42:31.569 --> 42:32.570
They made it.

43:01.348 --> 43:02.266
Wait, what's it doing?

43:39.845 --> 43:40.763
Did we get it?

43:52.608 --> 43:53.651
What's that?

44:54.253 --> 44:55.587
Good, you're finally awake.

44:57.923 --> 44:58.841
Where am I?

44:59.967 --> 45:00.968
A Yokosuka Hospital.

45:01.385 --> 45:03.011
They rescued us after the attack.

45:04.930 --> 45:05.973
The Kaishinmaru

45:05.973 --> 45:07.725
and Takao crews, did they make it?

45:13.105 --> 45:13.939
Oh-

45:14.440 --> 45:15.357
Godzilla.

45:16.316 --> 45:16.942
That's right.

45:16.942 --> 45:17.484
Easy.

45:17.484 --> 45:18.277
Where did it go?

45:18.277 --> 45:19.361
What happened?

45:19.361 --> 45:20.362
It disappeared.

45:20.904 --> 45:21.780
No one knows where it is.

45:21.780 --> 45:23.866
Godzilla was headed
straight for the mainland.

45:23.866 --> 45:25.534
We need to evacuate everyone,
or else this is going to be-

45:25.534 --> 45:27.119
Not so fast.

45:27.703 --> 45:30.080
The country has decided
not to tell the public.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.999
Why wouldn't they tell
everyone they're in danger?

45:31.999 --> 45:32.958
Because

45:33.125 --> 45:34.668
they don't want things
to get out of control.

45:34.668 --> 45:36.962
There's no time to
worry about any of that.

45:36.962 --> 45:38.672
We need to begin
evacuating now, otherwise...

45:38.672 --> 45:41.383
I understand what you're
saying and I agree with you.

45:42.176 --> 45:43.635
But they don't want chaos right now.

45:43.635 --> 45:46.597
Information control's the only
thing this country's good at.

45:55.481 --> 45:57.483
I want to know what's going on with you.

45:59.109 --> 46:00.360
Noriko, I'm fine.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.029
It's got nothing to do with you.

46:03.989 --> 46:06.408
Tell me what this thing
is that's tormenting you.

46:09.077 --> 46:10.454
Ever since you took me in,

46:11.413 --> 46:12.831
we've built a life together.

46:13.791 --> 46:14.958
But even through all of that,

46:14.958 --> 46:17.252
you still never really
let me into your life.

46:24.885 --> 46:26.637
I know it has to be a heavy burden,

46:28.347 --> 46:30.349
I wish you'd let me help you carry it.

46:42.653 --> 46:43.570
During the war

46:46.073 --> 46:46.907
I was-

46:57.459 --> 46:58.377
In the war

47:03.382 --> 47:04.424
I was a Kamikaze.

47:06.510 --> 47:07.344
What?

47:08.178 --> 47:09.471
The day I was sent out,

47:12.558 --> 47:14.893
I pretended there was an
issue with my fighter.

47:17.229 --> 47:18.397
So I flew to an island,

47:20.190 --> 47:21.483
and landed for repairs.

47:35.122 --> 47:36.039
These photos,

47:37.875 --> 47:38.709
they-

47:39.293 --> 47:41.336
they belonged to the the mechanics there.

47:44.548 --> 47:45.465
That day,

47:46.216 --> 47:47.217
they all died.

48:01.565 --> 48:02.649
During the night,

48:04.443 --> 48:07.279
a giant monster, like a
dinosaur, came ashore.

48:11.617 --> 48:12.534
They asked me

48:13.577 --> 48:15.996
to shoot at it with the gun on my fighter.

48:19.458 --> 48:20.375
But I froze.

48:26.173 --> 48:27.382
I just ran away again.

48:29.676 --> 48:30.969
I let them die.

48:30.969 --> 48:32.054
It was all my fault.

48:33.722 --> 48:35.724
I let that thing kill everyone.

48:35.724 --> 48:38.226
They were going to return
home to their families!

48:43.398 --> 48:44.316
The monster...

48:47.361 --> 48:48.779
Godzilla, that was its name.

48:53.700 --> 48:54.618
The other day,

48:55.243 --> 48:56.328
I saw it again.

48:59.498 --> 49:00.624
And just like back then

49:03.585 --> 49:05.253
I couldn't do anything to stop it.

49:15.305 --> 49:16.390
I don't deserve this.

49:18.684 --> 49:20.519
Why should I get the chance to live?

49:27.859 --> 49:28.735
Koichi,

49:31.613 --> 49:33.115
Everyone who survived the war,

49:33.991 --> 49:35.867
they all deserve to have a life again.

49:35.867 --> 49:37.828
Oh yeah, Noriko? And
how would you know that?

49:37.828 --> 49:38.996
Because of my parents!

49:40.080 --> 49:41.248
As they died in the fire,

49:41.248 --> 49:42.207
they called out,

49:42.207 --> 49:43.875
and said they wanted me to live.

49:44.751 --> 49:45.585
Whatever happens,

49:46.211 --> 49:48.422
whatever I do, I know
that I have to survive.

49:50.298 --> 49:51.591
It's what keeps me going.

50:04.396 --> 50:05.272
I can't.

50:08.525 --> 50:09.818
Every night,

50:09.818 --> 50:12.112
I hear them calling to me in my dreams.

50:12.946 --> 50:14.823
"Come and join us already, " they say.

50:15.782 --> 50:18.660
"Stop trying to cheat
death, and accept your fate."

50:19.202 --> 50:20.787
Those are just nightmares.

50:21.413 --> 50:23.498
- Illusions that you created for yourself.
- Sometimes-

50:23.498 --> 50:24.708
Sometimes

50:24.708 --> 50:25.709
I wonder

50:26.585 --> 50:27.502
I wonder

50:28.170 --> 50:29.087
if I'm still alive.

50:31.715 --> 50:33.341
What if I did die on that island?

50:34.259 --> 50:35.343
And I'm rotting there.

50:36.511 --> 50:37.345
You.

50:37.471 --> 50:38.513
What if you and

50:38.513 --> 50:40.348
Akiko- What if

50:40.724 --> 50:41.892
the two of you are just

50:41.892 --> 50:43.977
the final dreams of dead man. That's it!

50:43.977 --> 50:45.395
It has to be!

50:45.395 --> 50:46.813
- I know it!
- You are alive!

50:51.485 --> 50:53.236
You are alive, Koichi.

50:57.574 --> 50:58.742
Why can't you feel that?

51:13.173 --> 51:14.007
Okay,

51:14.716 --> 51:15.675
hold the spoon.

51:16.593 --> 51:17.427
See.

51:17.886 --> 51:18.970
Gently, gently.

51:19.930 --> 51:21.014
Be patient.

51:21.014 --> 51:21.932
Okay.

51:22.974 --> 51:25.393
- Good. Now, stir the broth.
- Mhm.

51:26.019 --> 51:27.145
You're doing great.

51:28.563 --> 51:29.397
There,

51:29.940 --> 51:30.857
it's done!

51:30.857 --> 51:31.775
Yay!

51:32.526 --> 51:33.652
And look.

51:33.652 --> 51:35.153
I added your favorite, daikon.

51:35.153 --> 51:36.113
Daikon!

51:36.279 --> 51:37.572
Let me know how it tastes.

51:37.572 --> 51:38.490
Okay.

51:38.740 --> 51:39.825
You ready for a sip?

51:42.410 --> 51:43.620
First the soup, then

51:43.620 --> 51:44.329
the daikon.

51:46.456 --> 51:47.415
I like it.

51:47.415 --> 51:48.416
Is it hot?

51:48.959 --> 51:50.669
- Don't burn your tongue.
- Uh huh.

51:50.669 --> 51:51.586
Here.

51:52.045 --> 51:53.797
Have another bite. How is it?

51:53.797 --> 51:54.714
Mmm.

51:55.090 --> 51:56.091
It's yummy!

51:56.091 --> 51:57.259
You like it?

51:57.259 --> 51:58.385
Am I really

52:00.971 --> 52:02.305
allowed to dream again now?

52:09.896 --> 52:11.439
Can I finally live my life?

52:30.959 --> 52:31.793
Whoa.

52:32.586 --> 52:33.503
Is that it?

52:34.462 --> 52:35.922
Hey... Go call it in.

52:37.591 --> 52:38.842
Hurry! Go!

52:39.092 --> 52:40.010
Yes, Sir!

53:00.989 --> 53:02.782
We just heard from an offshore patrol.

53:02.782 --> 53:05.327
A giant creature is
heading toward Tokyo Bay.

53:06.036 --> 53:06.912
Then it

53:07.162 --> 53:08.163
should be here soon.

53:10.248 --> 53:11.291
What is it?

53:11.291 --> 53:12.709
I don't believe it.

53:12.709 --> 53:13.752
You see something?

53:13.752 --> 53:15.003
Look at it.

53:15.003 --> 53:16.588
Have you ever seen anything like that?

53:18.632 --> 53:19.925
This is Tokyo Bay Defense.

53:19.925 --> 53:21.134
Preparing to detonate Zone Four.

53:21.134 --> 53:23.929
We'll try to block the
creature from going any further.

53:24.179 --> 53:25.222
It's closing in.

53:25.222 --> 53:26.223
Almost there.

53:30.393 --> 53:31.686
Breaching Zone Four now!

53:33.021 --> 53:33.939
There it is!

53:33.939 --> 53:35.106
Detonate!

53:37.817 --> 53:38.610
That get it?

53:39.778 --> 53:40.695
No good.

53:40.695 --> 53:42.113
The mines didn't damage it!

53:42.948 --> 53:44.449
Tokyo Bay blockade breached!

53:44.449 --> 53:46.952
The monster is now
heading towards Shinagawa!

53:46.952 --> 53:48.620
And it's gargantuan!

53:51.206 --> 53:52.332
Ooh. Oop.

53:54.292 --> 53:55.126
Ahh.

53:55.335 --> 53:56.253
Thank you.

54:08.723 --> 54:10.433
This is an emergency news broadcast.

54:10.433 --> 54:12.227
Do not turn off your radio sets.

54:12.227 --> 54:16.773
A giant creature has come ashore at
Tokyo Bay and is now heading toward Ginza.

54:16.773 --> 54:18.733
To those in or around the region,

54:18.733 --> 54:21.486
follow police instructions
and evacuate right away.

54:22.279 --> 54:23.863
- This is not a hoax.
- Ginza?

54:23.863 --> 54:24.948
I repeat-

54:26.950 --> 54:27.826
Go! Go!

54:31.830 --> 54:33.748
Oh, are you hurt? Here, come follow me!

55:06.531 --> 55:07.574
It stopped?

55:07.574 --> 55:08.491
Oh.

55:08.783 --> 55:09.868
Hey. What's going on?

55:09.868 --> 55:11.745
- What just happened?
- What was that?

55:28.845 --> 55:29.721
Is that

55:30.889 --> 55:31.765
Godzilla?

56:29.489 --> 56:30.323
Ah-

56:30.573 --> 56:31.408
Ah!

56:49.843 --> 56:52.303
What we're witnessing is
a scene beyond belief.

56:52.303 --> 56:53.346
We can only watch

56:53.346 --> 56:55.432
as the massive creature destroys our city!

56:55.432 --> 56:56.391
Each step it takes,

56:56.391 --> 56:58.143
Ginza is crushed in its path.

56:59.310 --> 57:01.896
And now it's begun tearing
apart the Nippon Theater!

57:02.439 --> 57:05.066
The Theater, once a
beloved icon of the people.

57:05.066 --> 57:06.693
Razed in mere moments.

57:06.693 --> 57:08.778
All of this, right before our very eyes!

57:10.697 --> 57:12.198
It's truly unbelievable.

57:12.198 --> 57:15.201
The district that survived
catastrophic air raids during the war,

57:15.201 --> 57:16.244
has been reduced

57:16.244 --> 57:17.537
to little more than rubble.

57:17.537 --> 57:18.997
Ah! And now

57:19.164 --> 57:20.331
the monster!

57:20.331 --> 57:21.583
It's approaching our position!

57:21.583 --> 57:22.667
As it moves closer,

57:22.667 --> 57:26.796
we can only stand back and watch as
its enormous head towers above us!

57:26.796 --> 57:28.047
This could be the end!

57:28.047 --> 57:29.674
It isn't safe for us to be here!

57:38.391 --> 57:39.267
We're falling!

57:42.854 --> 57:44.063
Run! Move. It's coming!

57:53.740 --> 57:54.782
Get out of the way!

58:03.833 --> 58:04.709
Get up!

58:05.168 --> 58:06.044
Koichi!

58:06.169 --> 58:07.212
We have to get out of here!

58:07.212 --> 58:08.213
Come on!

58:52.423 --> 58:53.258
Is it dead?

58:55.468 --> 58:56.386
Did they get it?

59:00.765 --> 59:01.683
What's happening?

59:01.683 --> 59:02.809
How is it still standing?

59:36.509 --> 59:37.510
Not again.

59:39.012 --> 59:40.263
It's just like the Takao.

01:00:34.442 --> 01:00:35.318
Noriko.

01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.905
Noriko!

01:00:41.532 --> 01:00:42.659
N-Noriko...

01:02:19.756 --> 01:02:22.300
The damage caused by the giant
creature that came ashore yesterday

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:26.345
includes a total of some 30,
000 killed or injured, and over 20,

01:02:26.345 --> 01:02:28.306
000 homes and buildings destroyed.

01:02:28.973 --> 01:02:31.851
Rescue and recovery
operations are already underway,

01:02:31.851 --> 01:02:34.270
but investigating the wreckage from
the creature's path carries the risk of

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:35.813
radiation, which has
severely impeded progress.

01:02:35.813 --> 01:02:37.231
- Alright, yes.
- Just stand back, hey, stand back.

01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:39.108
I can ask for you, alright?

01:02:39.108 --> 01:02:41.027
Throughout Ginza, pieces of the massive
beast's flesh have been discovered, after

01:02:41.027 --> 01:02:42.862
having apparently peeled
off during the attack.

01:02:42.862 --> 01:02:44.071
Be quiet!

01:02:44.322 --> 01:02:47.408
Police have cordoned off central Ginza
all day to collect samples of any

01:02:47.408 --> 01:02:49.243
materials of unknown composition.

01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:51.537
INVESTIGATION TEAM

01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:55.666
IN MOURNING

01:03:04.759 --> 01:03:06.010
I still can't believe it.

01:03:11.599 --> 01:03:12.809
What about Akiko?

01:03:13.643 --> 01:03:14.477
Hm?

01:03:15.353 --> 01:03:17.730
We all pull together to
take care of each other.

01:03:18.815 --> 01:03:19.732
Hey, Akiko.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:23.778
Remember.

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:28.032
You're going to stay at my
house when Dad's away, okay?

01:03:28.616 --> 01:03:30.243
When do I get to see Mom?

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:36.874
Mm.

01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:38.000
Not right now.

01:03:38.876 --> 01:03:41.420
She had to go away for a
little while for work.

01:03:42.421 --> 01:03:44.423
So you'll be with your auntie for a bit.

01:03:56.477 --> 01:03:59.730
Oh, Akiko. Come here,
sweetheart. It's okay.

01:04:01.774 --> 01:04:02.942
It'll be alright.

01:04:03.901 --> 01:04:04.819
Come here.

01:04:05.361 --> 01:04:06.320
It's okay.

01:04:31.679 --> 01:04:33.306
It's what I get, isn't it?

01:04:33.306 --> 01:04:34.473
For what I did to you.

01:04:41.647 --> 01:04:42.565
Of course.

01:04:44.692 --> 01:04:46.569
Why did I think I could dream again?

01:05:01.584 --> 01:05:02.501
Shiki-san.

01:05:04.462 --> 01:05:05.379
Listen to me.

01:05:06.339 --> 01:05:09.675
I'm part of a secret effort to
design a strategy to defeat Godzilla

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:13.012
led by a civilian force.

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:16.515
While I still don't know how viable it is,

01:05:20.227 --> 01:05:21.479
I'd like you to be there.

01:05:28.277 --> 01:05:31.739
SPECIAL DISASTER COUNTERMEASURE HEARING

01:05:37.286 --> 01:05:38.663
Look at all these guys.

01:05:38.663 --> 01:05:40.706
- Is everybody here-
- Yes.

01:05:40.706 --> 01:05:43.000
- They're all ex-navy personnel.
- Is that so?

01:05:43.876 --> 01:05:44.877
No kidding.

01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:58.349
CAPTAIN KEYAKI, CAPTAIN YUKAZE,
CAPTAIN HIBIKI, CAPTAIN YUKIKAZE

01:06:04.146 --> 01:06:05.022
My name

01:06:05.022 --> 01:06:06.023
is Hotta.

01:06:06.649 --> 01:06:08.192
I was the captain of the Yukikaze.

01:06:08.693 --> 01:06:10.236
Thank you all for coming today.

01:06:10.695 --> 01:06:11.696
As you're all aware,

01:06:12.196 --> 01:06:14.490
Tokyo is facing an unprecedented threat.

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:16.617
A powerful creature, so enormous

01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:21.664
that it can level an entire city. But
we lack defensive forces of our own.

01:06:22.289 --> 01:06:24.500
Any GHQ intervention runs the risk

01:06:25.126 --> 01:06:27.461
of further escalating US-Soviet tensions.

01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:29.714
No one is coming to help us.

01:06:30.715 --> 01:06:31.841
In short,

01:06:31.841 --> 01:06:34.093
the only option is to
confront this monster

01:06:34.093 --> 01:06:36.262
uniting our strengths as private citizens.

01:06:37.888 --> 01:06:40.349
And that is why we've
gathered you all here today.

01:06:41.017 --> 01:06:42.143
Fortunately,

01:06:42.685 --> 01:06:44.687
after rounds of negotiations,

01:06:44.687 --> 01:06:47.606
we secured four destroyers
slated for handover to the UN.

01:06:48.399 --> 01:06:49.692
- Are you kidding?
- What are you saying?

01:06:49.692 --> 01:06:51.110
They want us to fight.

01:06:51.777 --> 01:06:53.946
That you want us to
get back on navy ships?

01:06:53.946 --> 01:06:56.198
Just look at Ginza,
and what happened there.

01:06:56.824 --> 01:06:58.659
- There's nothing we can do to beat that.
- Mhm.

01:06:58.659 --> 01:06:59.744
Aren't those

01:06:59.744 --> 01:07:00.745
boats all disarmed?

01:07:01.328 --> 01:07:03.205
- What are you expecting us to do?
- That's right! You're dreaming!

01:07:03.205 --> 01:07:05.332
- This is insane!
- Excuse me!

01:07:05.332 --> 01:07:06.542
Could you all please calm down?

01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:08.502
That's exactly what I'm here to explain.

01:07:09.086 --> 01:07:09.879
Noda... -san?

01:07:11.338 --> 01:07:12.256
I would like to-

01:07:15.342 --> 01:07:16.177
Sorry.

01:07:17.678 --> 01:07:19.388
I would like to start
with an introduction.

01:07:19.388 --> 01:07:22.141
My name is Kenji Noda, and I
was a Navy technical officer.

01:07:22.641 --> 01:07:24.560
What we know about this monster is

01:07:25.394 --> 01:07:26.228
uh,

01:07:26.395 --> 01:07:27.563
the local people of Odo Island

01:07:27.563 --> 01:07:30.274
call it Godzilla, which
is how I'll refer to it.

01:07:30.274 --> 01:07:33.819
This creature is virtually immune to
all types of conventional weaponry.

01:07:33.819 --> 01:07:35.321
I've witnessed it first hand.

01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:38.783
As soon as the Takao hit it with
it's heavy cannons, Godzilla began

01:07:39.408 --> 01:07:41.327
regenerating itself back to health.

01:07:42.286 --> 01:07:43.954
What can you do
against a thing like that?

01:07:43.954 --> 01:07:45.331
Quiet, please.

01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:47.917
Our plan will instead
use the unconventional.

01:07:50.294 --> 01:07:51.170
Please,

01:07:51.337 --> 01:07:53.339
allow us to show you what I mean.

01:07:53.339 --> 01:07:56.300
The water in this tank has
the same salinity as sea water.

01:07:56.675 --> 01:07:58.928
There's a wooden
Godzilla model on the surface.

01:07:58.928 --> 01:08:01.764
Which you can see we've weighed
down just enough to float at the top.

01:08:01.764 --> 01:08:04.517
If we were to pipe in
freon gas, what would happen,

01:08:04.517 --> 01:08:06.769
once the model is enveloped in bubbles?

01:08:06.769 --> 01:08:08.687
Ohh, now that's an easy one.

01:08:08.687 --> 01:08:10.898
It'll stay afloat, even with the bubbles.

01:08:10.898 --> 01:08:12.775
- What else could it do?
- That's obvious.

01:08:12.775 --> 01:08:15.528
- Yeah, it'll float.
- Yes, that's what you would think.

01:08:21.617 --> 01:08:22.618
It sank!

01:08:22.618 --> 01:08:24.203
Look at that. Straight down.

01:08:25.329 --> 01:08:27.456
The freon bubbles surround
the wooden model,

01:08:27.456 --> 01:08:29.917
which prevents any contact with seawater.

01:08:29.917 --> 01:08:32.586
The idea is to trap the
real Godzilla just like this,

01:08:32.586 --> 01:08:35.506
and forcefully sink the
creature to the bottom of the ocean.

01:08:36.090 --> 01:08:36.924
Hey.

01:08:37.216 --> 01:08:40.261
Looks like the Doc carries a lot
of influence around here, huh?

01:08:40.261 --> 01:08:40.886
Uh huh.

01:08:53.983 --> 01:08:56.944
Now as you're all aware,
the Sagami Trench is over fifteen

01:08:56.944 --> 01:08:59.530
hundred meters deep,
making it the single deepest

01:08:59.530 --> 01:09:01.115
point in nearby waters.

01:09:01.115 --> 01:09:02.366
And so, my plan

01:09:02.366 --> 01:09:05.161
is to attach our freon gas
cylinders directly to Godzilla,

01:09:05.161 --> 01:09:06.620
and fire them all at once,

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.747
surrounding it in a
bubble membrane like you saw.

01:09:08.747 --> 01:09:09.832
The idea

01:09:09.999 --> 01:09:11.959
is that it will sink to the bottom
of the Trench so rapidly,

01:09:11.959 --> 01:09:13.544
the pressure will crush it to death.

01:09:16.797 --> 01:09:18.757
We kill it with the power of the ocean.

01:09:20.134 --> 01:09:21.051
I call it

01:09:21.594 --> 01:09:23.304
Special Operation Wada Tsumi.

01:09:24.388 --> 01:09:26.515
- Wada Tsumi?
- Couldn't it withstand the pressure if

01:09:26.515 --> 01:09:28.767
it's already used to living in the sea, though?

01:09:30.019 --> 01:09:31.145
The calculations show

01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:33.147
that after twenty-five seconds,

01:09:33.147 --> 01:09:36.650
every square meter should apply
fifteen hundred tons of pressure.

01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:39.111
Even a creature that's
used to living in deep water

01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:42.114
would be extremely unlikely to
survive that kind of pressure.

01:09:42.114 --> 01:09:43.073
I have a question.

01:09:44.241 --> 01:09:46.452
Can you guarantee this will kill Godzilla?

01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:51.540
Godzilla is a creature about
which we know very little.

01:09:52.208 --> 01:09:54.043
So theory has to drive our strategy.

01:09:55.628 --> 01:09:56.795
You call that a plan?

01:09:58.505 --> 01:10:00.257
Guns can't hurt it, as I have said, so,

01:10:00.257 --> 01:10:03.928
- we think that this is our-
- Just tell us if this will kill it or not.

01:10:06.305 --> 01:10:07.806
I can't guarantee that.

01:10:10.976 --> 01:10:12.186
Shikishima!

01:10:12.186 --> 01:10:13.687
This is our best shot!

01:10:18.943 --> 01:10:19.735
Shiki-san.

01:10:21.654 --> 01:10:23.113
Just hear me out, alright?

01:10:40.339 --> 01:10:41.465
Now then.

01:10:41.715 --> 01:10:42.800
Here is step one.

01:10:48.055 --> 01:10:51.600
Two destroyers will corral Godzilla
and wrap it in a cable like this.

01:10:52.935 --> 01:10:54.186
Running along the cable,

01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:58.440
will be various points that have
freon gas cylinders attached to them.

01:11:00.943 --> 01:11:02.486
Once it's wrapped tightly,

01:11:03.028 --> 01:11:04.488
the gas can then be released.

01:11:05.531 --> 01:11:09.785
This will force Godzilla to rapidly
plunge down fifteen hundred meters.

01:11:09.785 --> 01:11:11.495
If it doesn't work, what happens then?

01:11:11.495 --> 01:11:13.163
There's a contingency for that.

01:11:14.373 --> 01:11:15.624
Gentlemen,

01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:17.418
would you look into the courtyard?

01:11:35.894 --> 01:11:36.687
Inflate!

01:11:39.773 --> 01:11:40.733
- Wow.
- That was crazy.

01:11:40.733 --> 01:11:41.734
Amazing!

01:11:42.443 --> 01:11:44.486
Hello, I'm Itagaki from Toyo Balloon.

01:11:45.154 --> 01:11:46.739
Let me explain what you just saw.

01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:48.699
For this design, we chose to look at

01:11:48.699 --> 01:11:50.659
the life rafts used in the war.

01:11:50.659 --> 01:11:52.786
It's an inflatable flotation device.

01:11:52.786 --> 01:11:55.664
CO2 is shot at high velocity
into air sacs for buoyancy.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.833
Think of it like... a life preserver.

01:11:59.877 --> 01:12:01.337
Once Godzilla hits the bottom

01:12:02.046 --> 01:12:03.130
the device is inflated

01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:05.549
Forcing it right back up to the surface.

01:12:05.549 --> 01:12:09.011
Even if does initially withstand
the pressure, in these conditions,

01:12:09.011 --> 01:12:11.430
it's highly unlikely to
survive decompression.

01:12:12.222 --> 01:12:13.223
Even so,

01:12:13.432 --> 01:12:16.310
I can't tell you that this
will work with total certainty.

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:19.605
But I think this is going
to be our only real chance.

01:12:24.485 --> 01:12:26.403
I doubt that any of us want to be here.

01:12:27.237 --> 01:12:30.282
Putting your lives on the line
after already surviving a war.

01:12:30.449 --> 01:12:32.076
I know how unfair it sounds.

01:12:32.076 --> 01:12:33.160
And yet,

01:12:33.577 --> 01:12:34.495
we need your help.

01:12:35.329 --> 01:12:36.330
We're in this alone.

01:12:36.872 --> 01:12:38.207
No aid from any government.

01:12:39.124 --> 01:12:42.169
Which means the future of this
nation is in your hands again.

01:12:45.339 --> 01:12:46.256
I can't, sir.

01:12:48.509 --> 01:12:49.468
It's too much.

01:12:49.468 --> 01:12:50.427
I have a family.

01:12:50.427 --> 01:12:51.762
Everyone here does.

01:12:51.762 --> 01:12:53.430
Why do we have to risk our lives again?

01:12:54.098 --> 01:12:55.391
Why does it have to be us?

01:12:55.808 --> 01:12:58.102
We're always the ones
drawing the short straw.

01:12:59.353 --> 01:13:01.772
We can't go back to the
things we were doing in the war.

01:13:02.648 --> 01:13:03.941
He's right, it's not fair.

01:13:07.903 --> 01:13:09.238
Quiet, please.

01:13:09.238 --> 01:13:10.197
Please.

01:13:10.823 --> 01:13:11.824
Listen carefully.

01:13:12.908 --> 01:13:14.243
We aren't conscripting you.

01:13:15.202 --> 01:13:16.829
If you don't want to volunteer for this

01:13:16.829 --> 01:13:18.414
then go back to your families.

01:13:19.206 --> 01:13:20.457
None of us have the right

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:22.042
to stop any of you.

01:13:26.463 --> 01:13:27.965
- Hey.
- What?

01:13:28.632 --> 01:13:29.508
He's gonna leave.

01:13:29.508 --> 01:13:30.509
Hold on.

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:36.807
You too?

01:13:46.525 --> 01:13:47.401
I have a question.

01:13:49.278 --> 01:13:51.321
Does this plan of
yours mean certain death?

01:13:52.197 --> 01:13:53.240
Of course it doesn't.

01:13:56.076 --> 01:13:56.910
Okay.

01:13:57.202 --> 01:13:59.204
Well those odds are better than the war.

01:14:00.289 --> 01:14:01.290
I guess that's true.

01:14:02.207 --> 01:14:04.376
- That's right.
- Someone has to do it, right?

01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:06.503
Who else is gonna get this done?

01:14:07.004 --> 01:14:09.465
We need these ships, and
that means we need sailors.

01:14:09.465 --> 01:14:10.757
- I agree.
- He's right.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.427
What do you say?

01:14:13.427 --> 01:14:14.720
Are we in, boys?

01:14:24.021 --> 01:14:24.938
My friends.

01:14:27.441 --> 01:14:28.317
Thank you.

01:14:29.485 --> 01:14:30.402
Hear, hear!

01:14:38.202 --> 01:14:39.828
That was a surprise.

01:14:39.828 --> 01:14:43.290
Finding out our good ol Doc was
the one behind this crazy plan.

01:14:43.832 --> 01:14:46.793
Well, I've had a direct
encounter with Godzilla.

01:14:46.793 --> 01:14:47.961
Because of that,

01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:49.463
they suggested that I take the lead.

01:14:49.463 --> 01:14:52.966
Ah, that makes sense. That's why
they wanted us there too, isn't it?

01:14:52.966 --> 01:14:53.884
So,

01:14:54.301 --> 01:14:55.886
You think Godzilla will return?

01:14:57.429 --> 01:14:58.972
After that last attack,

01:14:58.972 --> 01:14:59.973
we can assume that

01:15:00.599 --> 01:15:03.685
Godzilla has added Tokyo to
its new "territory" of sorts.

01:15:03.685 --> 01:15:04.686
Which would mean

01:15:05.687 --> 01:15:08.232
in the worst case, it
could return within ten days.

01:15:08.815 --> 01:15:10.025
You think that soon?

01:15:10.025 --> 01:15:13.070
I heard you set up
radiation-detecting buoys all over.

01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:16.156
We can't just rely on our
sight to figure out where it is.

01:15:16.156 --> 01:15:17.491
Yeah, still though,

01:15:17.491 --> 01:15:20.869
you really think it's going to
walk into your trap just like that?

01:15:20.994 --> 01:15:23.372
- Well, that's the thing.
- What, you don't have a plan?

01:15:23.372 --> 01:15:25.165
Well yes, of course I do.

01:15:25.165 --> 01:15:27.084
Who do you think you're dealing with?

01:15:29.628 --> 01:15:32.589
We have underwater speakers
used for acoustic minesweeping.

01:15:32.714 --> 01:15:36.718
We use the speakers to play the recordings
made of Godzilla's voice during its

01:15:36.718 --> 01:15:37.803
last attack.

01:15:37.803 --> 01:15:39.137
- Godzilla's voice?
- Yeah.

01:15:39.555 --> 01:15:40.514
So it'll show up

01:15:40.514 --> 01:15:43.684
thinking it has another
territorial competitor to deal with.

01:15:44.601 --> 01:15:45.769
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully?

01:15:46.687 --> 01:15:48.063
You can't just rely on hope.

01:15:48.438 --> 01:15:49.398
And what was that

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.608
"flotation device" thing?

01:15:51.608 --> 01:15:54.444
I just don't see how that'll work
on something as big as Godzilla.

01:15:54.444 --> 01:15:56.697
I'd like to see you
think of something else.

01:15:56.697 --> 01:15:57.656
I know!

01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:59.866
What about pulling it
up using the destroyers?

01:15:59.866 --> 01:16:01.535
You insane? They couldn't do that.

01:16:01.535 --> 01:16:03.662
Godzilla weighs around
twenty thousand tons.

01:16:03.662 --> 01:16:05.747
That's far too heavy for two destroyers.

01:16:06.707 --> 01:16:07.541
Oh.

01:16:08.834 --> 01:16:10.294
In short, Doc, I think your plan

01:16:10.294 --> 01:16:11.837
has a lot of holes in it.

01:16:12.963 --> 01:16:14.548
Well if you're just gonna complain,

01:16:14.548 --> 01:16:16.633
why don't you come up with a better one?

01:16:19.136 --> 01:16:20.053
Noda-san.

01:16:22.222 --> 01:16:23.557
If I asked you for a figher

01:16:24.266 --> 01:16:25.183
could you get me one?

01:16:26.476 --> 01:16:27.603
A fighter?

01:16:27.603 --> 01:16:29.771
If it does decide to come ashore,

01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:32.441
then I think I could use my
guns to draw it out to the bay.

01:16:33.025 --> 01:16:36.653
But I thought all the Japanese fighters
were decommissioned after the war.

01:16:36.653 --> 01:16:38.071
Besides, even if I could,

01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:39.948
it shoots out that heat ray as well.

01:16:40.324 --> 01:16:41.908
Flying so close to it like that,

01:16:42.284 --> 01:16:45.245
- you'd be risking your life.
- I don't care what the risks are!

01:16:45.245 --> 01:16:49.082
And besides, a good fighter is going to
outrun and outmaneuver any of our boats.

01:16:49.082 --> 01:16:52.419
Are you asking us to help you with this
because you really think it's going to

01:16:52.419 --> 01:16:53.337
work?

01:16:53.712 --> 01:16:55.047
Or are you just trying to die?

01:16:57.132 --> 01:16:57.966
I think you're drunk.

01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:00.636
I think you just want to avenge Noriko.

01:17:02.095 --> 01:17:03.263
What's so wrong with that?

01:17:03.263 --> 01:17:05.057
You waited to long.

01:17:07.351 --> 01:17:10.771
Why the hell didn't you marry that
girl when you had the chance, huh?

01:17:11.396 --> 01:17:13.065
You knew how she felt, didn't you?

01:17:13.065 --> 01:17:15.442
Don't you think I also wanted that?

01:17:16.777 --> 01:17:18.570
Then why didn't say anything to her?

01:17:20.947 --> 01:17:21.865
Because I couldn't.

01:17:28.705 --> 01:17:30.582
My war isn't over yet.

01:17:56.191 --> 01:17:57.150
Is it true?

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:58.735
- You found a plane?
- Yeah.

01:17:58.735 --> 01:18:00.529
However, it is a bit unique.

01:18:20.215 --> 01:18:22.426
It was developed at the end of the war.

01:18:22.426 --> 01:18:23.927
A short-range interceptor

01:18:23.927 --> 01:18:24.845
know as the Shinden.

01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:28.932
Built to utilize fast hit and run tactics.

01:18:28.932 --> 01:18:31.226
It can hit speeds of
over four hundred knots.

01:18:31.685 --> 01:18:32.894
It's a canard design,

01:18:32.894 --> 01:18:34.438
with four thirty millimeter guns,

01:18:34.438 --> 01:18:36.481
it can outmaneuver almost anything.

01:18:37.023 --> 01:18:39.985
A true marvel of aeronautical innovation.

01:18:41.403 --> 01:18:42.821
The fighters like this one here,

01:18:42.821 --> 01:18:44.948
were never deployed before the surrender.

01:18:45.407 --> 01:18:46.700
Towards the end of the war,

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.577
they were all kept here for storage.

01:18:48.785 --> 01:18:51.496
Until eventually, they were
forgotten about entirely.

01:18:52.581 --> 01:18:54.666
Since then, they've just sat here to rust.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:56.376
This one's in pretty bad shape.

01:18:57.753 --> 01:18:58.670
It's not airworthy.

01:18:59.671 --> 01:19:00.672
Not yet.

01:19:00.839 --> 01:19:01.715
Well, you see, that's the issue.

01:19:01.715 --> 01:19:03.258
We need a top mechanic.

01:19:03.258 --> 01:19:04.176
Or,

01:19:04.509 --> 01:19:07.345
an engineer that really knows
their way around a fighter.

01:19:09.806 --> 01:19:10.724
Actually,

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:13.101
I know just the person.

01:19:16.062 --> 01:19:18.774
Let's see. An Ex-Odo
Island detachment mechanic...

01:19:18.774 --> 01:19:21.276
- Sosaku Tachibana, you said?
- Right.

01:19:21.276 --> 01:19:24.404
Tachibana, Tachibana,
let's see. Tachibana, let's see.

01:19:25.822 --> 01:19:28.074
It looks like we don't
have a current address.

01:19:28.074 --> 01:19:29.159
I understand.

01:19:29.159 --> 01:19:32.496
We're getting hit hard with all
sorts of requests like this one.

01:19:32.496 --> 01:19:34.706
It could take quite a bit of
time for us to find anything.

01:19:34.706 --> 01:19:37.542
You don't understand. I need to
speak with him as soon as I can.

01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:40.504
That's too bad. I'm sorry, I
don't know what else I can do.

01:19:40.504 --> 01:19:41.505
- Sir, please!
- What?

01:19:41.505 --> 01:19:42.714
I'm begging you!

01:19:42.714 --> 01:19:45.217
The country's future depends on it!

01:19:45.217 --> 01:19:46.635
Oh, it does, I'm sure.

01:19:46.635 --> 01:19:48.637
But I can't do the impossible.

01:19:48.637 --> 01:19:50.263
- So sorry.
- Ah-

01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:51.056
Hold on.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.599
Tachibana.

01:19:52.599 --> 01:19:54.851
Do you know where he was
posted before he got to Odo Island?

01:19:54.851 --> 01:19:56.436
Can you at least tell me that?

01:20:02.567 --> 01:20:03.819
TO MR. WADA

01:20:03.819 --> 01:20:05.737
I've already asked everywhere I can.

01:20:06.279 --> 01:20:07.864
- Oh.
- But this Tachibana fellow,

01:20:08.073 --> 01:20:09.866
he's proving to be
quite hard to track down.

01:20:09.866 --> 01:20:10.951
Oh good.

01:20:11.201 --> 01:20:12.452
- Well, thank you for coming.
- We can find someone else to help

01:20:12.452 --> 01:20:14.329
- us get the plane up in the air.
- That's forty-one yen.

01:20:14.329 --> 01:20:15.247
Think.

01:20:15.455 --> 01:20:16.623
- Do you have any other leads?
- More?

01:20:16.623 --> 01:20:19.042
- Please just wait a little longer.
- Yes please.

01:20:19.751 --> 01:20:22.420
I don't know why you're
being so insistent, Shiki-san.

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.798
Godzilla could come back
soon, we can't be wasting our-

01:20:24.798 --> 01:20:26.633
It's got to be Tachibana, alright?!

01:20:27.175 --> 01:20:29.511
I'm sure he'll get the
message soon, he has to.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.888
Wait for him, please.

01:20:58.582 --> 01:21:00.125
T- Tachibana.

01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:02.627
T- Tachibana-san!

01:21:03.461 --> 01:21:04.254
It really is you!

01:21:08.967 --> 01:21:11.052
What the hell are all these letters about?

01:21:14.681 --> 01:21:15.515
Wait.

01:21:18.226 --> 01:21:20.061
The Odo Island massacre was my fault?

01:21:20.937 --> 01:21:22.606
I'm the one who let those men die?

01:21:24.774 --> 01:21:26.109
What are you talking about?

01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:28.028
I'm sorry.

01:21:29.154 --> 01:21:30.322
I needed you to find me.

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:32.073
And sending those

01:21:32.073 --> 01:21:34.701
was the one thing I knew
would get under your skin.

01:21:34.993 --> 01:21:35.827
How dare you?!

01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:40.165
The monster that attacked Ginza...

01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:42.834
Was the same one from Odo.

01:21:44.294 --> 01:21:45.420
It was Godzilla.

01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:54.888
We have a fighter

01:21:55.805 --> 01:21:57.682
we're gonna use it to try and kill it.

01:21:57.891 --> 01:21:59.434
And I need your help to fix it.

01:22:00.685 --> 01:22:02.103
That's why I had to find you.

01:22:02.854 --> 01:22:05.190
We need a mechanic who
can get it ready to fly.

01:22:05.857 --> 01:22:08.193
That's why I wrote all
of those stupid letters.

01:22:10.487 --> 01:22:11.363
Please forgive me!

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.662
Forget it. You're on your own.

01:22:20.538 --> 01:22:21.957
Why would I ever help you?

01:22:23.333 --> 01:22:24.167
Tachibana!

01:22:24.167 --> 01:22:26.086
Please, wait. Tachibana!

01:22:26.711 --> 01:22:27.754
Please don't go!

01:22:27.754 --> 01:22:28.880
Tachibana!

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.757
I need you to do something for me!

01:22:31.466 --> 01:22:32.634
Something...

01:22:32.634 --> 01:22:34.803
something I know that only you can do.

01:22:37.013 --> 01:22:38.515
The Takao's guns did nothing,

01:22:38.515 --> 01:22:41.851
but I detonated a mine in its
mouth and it actually hurt it.

01:22:41.851 --> 01:22:45.230
I think we can kill it if we find
a way to hit it from the inside!

01:22:46.982 --> 01:22:47.899
You mean...

01:22:49.567 --> 01:22:51.319
Put explosives in the rig

01:22:51.319 --> 01:22:54.906
and fly directly into it's mouth so we
can finally kill it once and for all.

01:23:01.788 --> 01:23:02.622
A Kamikaze.

01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:06.835
The war isn't over yet.

01:23:10.255 --> 01:23:11.965
Not for me, or for you.

01:23:15.051 --> 01:23:15.885
Ahhhh...

01:23:17.095 --> 01:23:18.972
I thought you said you just fell down.

01:23:19.681 --> 01:23:21.307
- Agh-
- You had to hit yourself pretty

01:23:21.307 --> 01:23:22.934
hard for it swell up that much.

01:23:23.393 --> 01:23:24.436
It's embarrassing,

01:23:24.436 --> 01:23:26.312
I ended up getting pretty drunk.

01:23:26.312 --> 01:23:28.023
I barely remember anything.

01:23:28.606 --> 01:23:31.317
Well considering you found
Tachibana after looking so hard,

01:23:31.317 --> 01:23:33.695
I think you deserved
to celebrate a little.

01:23:34.988 --> 01:23:36.406
A canard, huh?

01:23:38.033 --> 01:23:40.577
I didn't think that they
had actually finished one.

01:23:42.912 --> 01:23:43.997
Tachibana-san.

01:23:44.873 --> 01:23:47.250
You made it. Thank you all for coming!

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:48.960
Hello, you must be Mr. Tachibana.

01:23:52.922 --> 01:23:53.840
Look at that.

01:23:54.549 --> 01:23:56.801
Must be one of the
Shinden class interceptors, huh?

01:23:56.801 --> 01:23:57.719
Yes.

01:23:58.386 --> 01:24:01.181
This one wasn't finished.
You think you can make it fly?

01:24:03.558 --> 01:24:06.102
We'll do everything we can
to get make that happen.

01:24:06.394 --> 01:24:07.562
We really appreciate it.

01:24:08.938 --> 01:24:09.981
Good luck.

01:24:10.857 --> 01:24:11.441
Good luck.

01:24:21.576 --> 01:24:22.869
Alright, let's pick it up!

01:24:23.995 --> 01:24:25.246
Get those crates on, now!

01:24:26.456 --> 01:24:27.248
- Yes, Sir!
- Hey!

01:24:28.374 --> 01:24:29.667
Get moving boys!

01:24:29.667 --> 01:24:30.668
What's wrong?

01:24:31.586 --> 01:24:34.923
You need to lighten up a little
there, Doc, it ain't good for morale.

01:24:34.923 --> 01:24:36.966
I know that this was my idea, and yet

01:24:36.966 --> 01:24:38.927
I still worry that for everything to work,

01:24:38.927 --> 01:24:41.221
we'll need some kind of miracle to happen.

01:24:41.221 --> 01:24:42.764
I know you're worried.

01:24:42.764 --> 01:24:43.973
But to get a miracle,

01:24:43.973 --> 01:24:46.101
you don't just stand by and wait for one.

01:24:46.267 --> 01:24:47.185
Yes, you're right.

01:24:48.228 --> 01:24:49.312
Take a look out there.

01:24:49.979 --> 01:24:50.855
These guys know.

01:24:52.524 --> 01:24:53.650
They aren't naive.

01:24:54.609 --> 01:24:57.737
They understand they're putting
their lives at risk to do this.

01:24:58.571 --> 01:24:59.489
And yet...

01:25:00.782 --> 01:25:03.409
Their faces. They're bright and beaming.

01:25:04.327 --> 01:25:08.665
That's because they know, this time, they
have a chance to make a real difference.

01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:11.251
A real difference?

01:25:11.793 --> 01:25:12.627
Ah.

01:25:14.212 --> 01:25:16.589
In the war, we were used
to suffering every day.

01:25:17.423 --> 01:25:18.341
But now,

01:25:19.217 --> 01:25:20.510
we get to do good again.

01:25:36.317 --> 01:25:37.193
Hurry up!

01:25:40.488 --> 01:25:41.489
Make some room.

01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:44.200
This just came in.

01:25:44.909 --> 01:25:46.786
East of Hachijo Island...

01:25:46.786 --> 01:25:49.205
Thirty three point one degrees North,

01:25:49.205 --> 01:25:51.082
One forty point oh-one degrees East...

01:25:51.082 --> 01:25:54.377
Geiger readings from multiple
detection buoys, about an hour ago.

01:25:55.295 --> 01:25:56.379
Followed by

01:25:56.963 --> 01:25:57.714
here

01:25:57.714 --> 01:25:58.673
and here.

01:26:14.272 --> 01:26:15.523
Godzilla is on its way.

01:26:16.649 --> 01:26:18.276
- It's happening.
- Are we ready?

01:26:18.276 --> 01:26:20.195
If it continues at this current rate,

01:26:20.445 --> 01:26:23.615
Godzilla is expected to
arrive at the Sagami Trench

01:26:23.615 --> 01:26:26.284
at approximately eleven
hundred hours tomorrow.

01:26:26.284 --> 01:26:27.327
That means

01:26:27.327 --> 01:26:30.163
we need to leave port right
at oh eight hundred hours.

01:26:30.163 --> 01:26:31.289
Oh eight hundred.

01:26:32.457 --> 01:26:33.458
Itagaki.

01:26:34.125 --> 01:26:35.084
Your flotation device.

01:26:35.084 --> 01:26:36.502
It'll be ready by then, right?

01:26:37.879 --> 01:26:39.714
We should be there on the destroyers.

01:26:39.964 --> 01:26:41.883
The final three hours will be critical.

01:26:42.383 --> 01:26:45.011
- As engineers, we want perfection.
- I can't ask that.

01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:46.596
And you could get caught up

01:26:46.596 --> 01:26:47.931
in our fight against Godzilla.

01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:50.600
The four of us have seen war, too.

01:26:56.856 --> 01:26:57.774
Then everyone,

01:26:58.441 --> 01:26:59.567
you should all go home.

01:26:59.984 --> 01:27:01.402
Spend as much time as you can

01:27:02.195 --> 01:27:03.446
with your families tonight.

01:27:05.448 --> 01:27:07.575
Are you saying that we
should prepare them?

01:27:12.038 --> 01:27:12.956
We all know that

01:27:14.374 --> 01:27:15.750
for too long, this country

01:27:16.626 --> 01:27:18.670
has treated our lives far too cheaply.

01:27:20.046 --> 01:27:21.839
Tanks with insufficient armor.

01:27:23.007 --> 01:27:24.133
Poor supply chains,

01:27:24.133 --> 01:27:28.930
leading to starvation and disease causing
the most casualties during the war.

01:27:30.556 --> 01:27:31.516
Fighter planes,

01:27:32.433 --> 01:27:35.561
built without ejection seats,
which should be the bare minimum.

01:27:37.313 --> 01:27:38.231
And finally,

01:27:39.065 --> 01:27:41.025
kamikaze and suicide attacks.

01:27:43.361 --> 01:27:45.196
Those are the reasons why, this time,

01:27:47.031 --> 01:27:49.158
I want this citizen-led effort of ours

01:27:51.536 --> 01:27:54.122
to be one that aims to
sacrifice no lives at all!

01:27:56.916 --> 01:27:58.167
Because this next battle,

01:27:59.127 --> 01:28:00.753
isn't about a fight to the death.

01:28:02.422 --> 01:28:04.716
This battle is a fight
to live for our future.

01:28:07.135 --> 01:28:07.969
Mm.

01:28:08.177 --> 01:28:09.971
Alright, yes! Okay!

01:28:09.971 --> 01:28:10.888
Let's do this!

01:28:17.687 --> 01:28:20.106
Finally, tomorrow's the day.

01:28:20.106 --> 01:28:21.482
Look at me, I'm shivering.

01:28:21.482 --> 01:28:22.942
You're not going, kid.

01:28:25.737 --> 01:28:28.114
- What do you mean?
- We're not gonna have any use for

01:28:28.114 --> 01:28:29.782
you while your arm is like that.

01:28:30.783 --> 01:28:32.160
Shikishima still gets to go.

01:28:32.994 --> 01:28:35.121
Hold on, is this cause
I wasn't in the war?

01:28:35.413 --> 01:28:38.333
- I can help you guys, I'm not useless!
- Look, kid.

01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:39.876
Not being part of a war

01:28:41.044 --> 01:28:42.837
is something to be grateful for.

01:28:49.761 --> 01:28:51.637
I still want to defend my country too.

01:28:55.266 --> 01:28:57.310
I don't understand why I don't get to go!

01:28:59.812 --> 01:29:02.482
I thought we were a team,
that we were in this together!

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.401
Don't do this!

01:29:06.819 --> 01:29:08.112
I want to be there with you!

01:29:09.155 --> 01:29:11.032
Let me go! Please!

01:29:11.032 --> 01:29:13.326
We're leaving this
country's future with you.

01:29:13.743 --> 01:29:14.660
Captain!

01:29:15.536 --> 01:29:16.579
Noda-san!

01:29:17.789 --> 01:29:19.165
Good. Good.

01:29:19.999 --> 01:29:21.292
Now bring it up.

01:29:22.835 --> 01:29:26.172
Steady the front end. Good. Careful now.

01:29:28.383 --> 01:29:29.300
A little bit lower.

01:29:30.635 --> 01:29:31.469
Easy.

01:29:46.567 --> 01:29:47.402
Akiko,

01:29:47.568 --> 01:29:48.319
you ready?

01:29:48.319 --> 01:29:49.487
- Okay.
- Here.

01:29:49.487 --> 01:29:50.488
- Mm?
- Here you go.

01:29:52.448 --> 01:29:53.366
I'll see you soon.

01:29:59.122 --> 01:29:59.956
And,

01:30:00.748 --> 01:30:01.624
Sumiko?

01:30:02.542 --> 01:30:03.793
Thank you for everything.

01:30:17.306 --> 01:30:18.141
Akiko.

01:30:19.475 --> 01:30:20.726
You have fun with Auntie?

01:30:21.227 --> 01:30:22.645
Yeah, I had fun.

01:30:22.645 --> 01:30:23.896
That's good.

01:30:23.896 --> 01:30:24.897
She's nice, huh?

01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:30.528
S'that for me?

01:30:32.655 --> 01:30:33.573
Thank you.

01:30:39.537 --> 01:30:40.371
Akiko?

01:30:40.788 --> 01:30:41.622
Hm?

01:30:41.789 --> 01:30:42.999
There's us,

01:30:42.999 --> 01:30:44.000
but who's this?

01:30:44.834 --> 01:30:45.668
Is that mom?

01:30:47.336 --> 01:30:49.213
Uh huh, mom's right there.

01:30:50.756 --> 01:30:51.674
Look at that.

01:30:53.301 --> 01:30:54.343
You're so talented.

01:31:05.771 --> 01:31:07.273
What's wrong, why are you sad?

01:31:12.528 --> 01:31:13.446
What is it?

01:31:14.489 --> 01:31:15.323
Akiko.

01:31:16.407 --> 01:31:17.658
It's okay.

01:31:17.825 --> 01:31:18.659
Hey.

01:31:20.286 --> 01:31:21.204
It's okay.

01:31:21.913 --> 01:31:22.830
Hey, I'm here.

01:31:23.956 --> 01:31:25.416
I'll always be here for you.

01:31:32.089 --> 01:31:33.216
TO SUMIKO

01:32:41.909 --> 01:32:42.827
Tachibana-san.

01:32:45.162 --> 01:32:45.913
Is it ready?

01:32:50.167 --> 01:32:51.085
Give me a minute.

01:33:03.264 --> 01:33:04.807
There's the bomb you asked for.

01:33:06.267 --> 01:33:08.603
Two machine guns, a hundred forty kilos.

01:33:08.603 --> 01:33:10.813
A hundred twenty rounds, eighty kilos.

01:33:10.813 --> 01:33:13.816
And we pulled out the main
fuel tank dropping four hundred.

01:33:14.275 --> 01:33:16.611
Instead, you've got a number
twenty-five bomb in the nose,

01:33:16.611 --> 01:33:18.446
and a number fifty in the fuselage.

01:33:20.573 --> 01:33:23.284
Good. Now I have a chance to
finally make things right.

01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:38.466
The funny thing is

01:33:43.387 --> 01:33:45.765
I guess there's a part
of me that wants to live.

01:33:50.269 --> 01:33:52.438
No one on the Odo
Island crew wanted to die.

01:33:54.023 --> 01:33:55.566
But they didn't get to go home.

01:33:57.318 --> 01:33:58.611
None of them.

01:33:58.611 --> 01:34:00.112
They didn't get the chance to

01:34:00.946 --> 01:34:02.573
because that monster killed them.

01:34:05.159 --> 01:34:06.410
I know what I have to do.

01:34:29.475 --> 01:34:30.685
This was drawn by a girl

01:34:30.685 --> 01:34:31.894
named Akiko.

01:34:33.813 --> 01:34:35.606
I want there to be a future for her.

01:34:40.277 --> 01:34:41.821
Godzilla has to be stopped.

01:34:42.446 --> 01:34:43.906
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:34:44.824 --> 01:34:46.826
Well, then I guess you're finally ready.

01:34:49.245 --> 01:34:50.079
Now

01:34:51.539 --> 01:34:52.540
this is important.

01:34:53.874 --> 01:34:54.667
Down here.

01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:57.962
This is the safety for the bomb.

01:34:58.796 --> 01:35:00.715
Pull it right before
you fly into its mouth.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:01.716
Got it?

01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:04.719
One more thing.

01:35:14.478 --> 01:35:15.312
Oh-

01:35:15.730 --> 01:35:16.564
Akiko.

01:35:18.816 --> 01:35:19.859
Why are you out here?

01:35:20.317 --> 01:35:21.235
Are you alone?

01:35:22.486 --> 01:35:23.320
Look.

01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:49.221
LOOK AFTER AKIKO.
USE THIS MONEY FOR HER.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.354
Is it from Daddy?

01:35:59.899 --> 01:36:00.733
Huh?

01:36:01.317 --> 01:36:02.318
From Daddy?

01:36:02.318 --> 01:36:03.235
Here.

01:36:04.487 --> 01:36:05.362
It's alright.

01:36:05.362 --> 01:36:06.530
Don't worry, sweetheart.

01:36:24.006 --> 01:36:25.424
Kuroshio Twelve here.

01:36:25.424 --> 01:36:28.594
We see floating deep see fish.
Thirty-five point oh-three North.

01:36:28.594 --> 01:36:30.471
One-thirty-nine point forty-one East.

01:36:49.281 --> 01:36:51.575
Godzilla has been sighted in Sagami Bay!

01:36:52.159 --> 01:36:56.747
The underwater decoy team is deploying
the audio lure to bring it to the

01:36:56.747 --> 01:36:57.748
target area!

01:36:58.332 --> 01:37:00.668
- We better go.
- Mm.

01:37:00.668 --> 01:37:07.675
- Looks like Mizushima finally gave up.
- I feel bad, but it's for his own good.

01:37:10.678 --> 01:37:11.804
To be honest,

01:37:11.804 --> 01:37:13.472
I didn't want Shikishima flying, either.

01:37:13.472 --> 01:37:16.016
I'm worried that he could
do something reckless today.

01:37:16.016 --> 01:37:17.059
And I don't want that.

01:37:17.059 --> 01:37:18.310
He's got Akiko.

01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:19.895
He can't just leave her alone.

01:37:30.406 --> 01:37:33.033
The underwater decoy
team has been destroyed!

01:37:33.033 --> 01:37:38.080
Godzilla has entered Sagami Bay!
Wada Tsumi ships, leave port at once!

01:37:39.206 --> 01:37:40.040
Look.

01:37:41.208 --> 01:37:42.501
There it is.

01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:44.003
It's already here?

01:37:55.431 --> 01:37:58.851
Godzilla's through the final line
of defense! It's heading for shore!

01:38:00.477 --> 01:38:01.145
That's my signal.

01:38:51.028 --> 01:38:51.862
Mm.

01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:58.494
Get out there and put an end to this war.

01:38:59.787 --> 01:39:00.704
Shikishima.

01:39:01.288 --> 01:39:03.457
Everyone, leave port now!

01:39:03.457 --> 01:39:07.962
Repeat. All Wada Tsumi ships are to finish
boarding and leave port immediately!

01:39:14.551 --> 01:39:15.469
What now Doc?

01:39:16.136 --> 01:39:17.554
It's too late to do anything.

01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:19.473
No, we just have to keep going.

01:39:19.974 --> 01:39:21.016
The Sagami Trench

01:39:21.016 --> 01:39:23.352
is key. There's no where else
suitable to execute our plan.

01:39:23.352 --> 01:39:24.603
But we need to be there.

01:39:25.104 --> 01:39:26.355
We have to rely

01:39:26.355 --> 01:39:28.399
on Shiki-san to lure it out to us!

01:39:28.399 --> 01:39:29.608
- Yes sir!
- Let's do this.

01:39:29.608 --> 01:39:30.609
Let's go!

01:39:46.875 --> 01:39:47.918
Noda-san!

01:39:47.918 --> 01:39:49.044
Shikishima's calling!

01:39:50.796 --> 01:39:51.880
Shikishima here.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:53.215
I've taken off successfully.

01:39:53.215 --> 01:39:55.509
I'll start to lure
Godzilla to the target area.

01:39:55.509 --> 01:39:57.594
Good. We'll make sure
that we're ready for you.

01:39:57.594 --> 01:39:59.888
- Get to the target area quickly.
- Shikishima!

01:40:00.514 --> 01:40:01.807
You better not try anything!

01:40:01.807 --> 01:40:04.226
I won't let you
abandon Akiko, you got that?

01:40:07.271 --> 01:40:08.856
Do you hear me, Shikishima?

01:40:11.025 --> 01:40:12.026
Nothing.

01:40:12.151 --> 01:40:13.152
What is he thinking?

01:40:32.504 --> 01:40:33.630
One, two...

01:40:34.214 --> 01:40:35.132
One, two...

01:40:36.258 --> 01:40:37.259
Telegram!

01:40:38.969 --> 01:40:39.803
Oh.

01:40:46.685 --> 01:40:48.645
- Yes?
- Mrs. Shikishima?

01:40:51.565 --> 01:40:52.566
A telegram for you.

01:40:52.566 --> 01:40:53.484
Oh.

01:42:16.775 --> 01:42:18.277
Look it that.

01:42:18.277 --> 01:42:19.903
Nice job, Shikishima.

01:42:20.904 --> 01:42:24.199
It worked. And Godzilla
doesn't look too happy, does it?

01:42:24.199 --> 01:42:25.200
Now's our chance.

01:42:26.118 --> 01:42:27.202
It's up to us now.

01:42:30.789 --> 01:42:31.707
All ships,

01:42:31.707 --> 01:42:33.292
- prepare for battle!
- You heard him, battle positions!

01:42:33.292 --> 01:42:34.877
Battle positions!

01:42:37.504 --> 01:42:38.422
Freon cylinders ready!

01:42:39.006 --> 01:42:41.550
Forty-six centimeter shells
ready! Flotation switch ready!

01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:43.177
Cables look good!

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.636
Circuits are a go.

01:42:44.636 --> 01:42:45.596
We're ready when you are.

01:42:45.596 --> 01:42:46.638
We're turning on the power!

01:42:46.638 --> 01:42:48.015
Release the safety device!

01:43:04.948 --> 01:43:05.949
That's right.

01:43:05.949 --> 01:43:06.992
I see you.

01:43:09.077 --> 01:43:10.329
Alright, Team one.

01:43:10.329 --> 01:43:11.288
Get out there.

01:43:11.288 --> 01:43:13.248
- Team one, attack!
- Team one, attack!

01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:45.072
That's it.

01:44:08.053 --> 01:44:08.971
Hold on!

01:44:22.693 --> 01:44:23.944
Holy hell.

01:44:23.944 --> 01:44:25.237
So that's its heat ray.

01:44:28.031 --> 01:44:29.700
The ships will never survive this.

01:44:30.367 --> 01:44:31.368
Listen, sir.

01:44:31.368 --> 01:44:33.328
We should evacuate
while there's still time.

01:44:33.328 --> 01:44:34.454
No. At least not yet.

01:44:34.788 --> 01:44:36.248
We need to start while we still can.

01:44:36.248 --> 01:44:37.207
Doctor,

01:44:37.499 --> 01:44:38.375
It'll shoot the heat ray again!

01:44:38.375 --> 01:44:39.418
Not for a while.

01:44:39.418 --> 01:44:42.212
Once Godzilla fires its
heat ray, it has to recharge.

01:44:43.005 --> 01:44:44.131
We have to go!

01:44:45.299 --> 01:44:46.675
Start the operation, now!

01:44:52.097 --> 01:44:53.598
Wada Tsumi is a go!

01:44:53.598 --> 01:44:54.266
That's an order!

01:45:12.701 --> 01:45:14.661
Freon and flotation units, stand by:

01:45:14.661 --> 01:45:15.662
On my order:

01:45:15.662 --> 01:45:16.872
Begin launch!

01:45:42.272 --> 01:45:43.190
Shiki-san!

01:46:09.758 --> 01:46:10.926
Crane fully deployed!

01:46:10.926 --> 01:46:11.843
Roger!

01:46:12.594 --> 01:46:13.845
We need to maintain our course.

01:46:13.845 --> 01:46:15.222
Call the Hibiki!

01:46:15.222 --> 01:46:16.181
Hibiki,

01:46:16.431 --> 01:46:17.557
maintain course!

01:46:17.557 --> 01:46:19.101
We're going to take a little damage.

01:46:19.101 --> 01:46:20.477
Stay at our current speed!

01:46:25.315 --> 01:46:26.733
Hibiki closing in,

01:46:26.733 --> 01:46:27.734
Four meters!

01:46:28.902 --> 01:46:29.820
Two meters!

01:46:30.612 --> 01:46:33.740
- Brace for impact! Hold on!
- Brace for impact!

01:46:48.547 --> 01:46:49.673
Crossing successful!

01:46:49.673 --> 01:46:50.674
Full speed ahead!

01:46:50.674 --> 01:46:52.759
Full speed!

01:47:07.941 --> 01:47:08.775
Good.

01:47:09.234 --> 01:47:10.068
Good!

01:47:11.153 --> 01:47:13.113
- Go get the switch ready!
- On it!

01:47:22.122 --> 01:47:22.873
What's it doing?

01:47:22.873 --> 01:47:23.874
We ready?

01:47:25.292 --> 01:47:26.334
We're close.

01:47:36.928 --> 01:47:38.930
Ready when you are, Doc.

01:47:48.482 --> 01:47:49.441
Hit it, Captain!

01:47:49.441 --> 01:47:50.442
Roger that!

01:47:52.652 --> 01:47:53.695
The freon!

01:47:53.695 --> 01:47:54.488
Got it!

01:48:10.921 --> 01:48:11.755
Depth:

01:48:12.172 --> 01:48:13.256
Twelve hundred meters!

01:48:14.341 --> 01:48:15.091
Thirteen hundred!

01:48:16.092 --> 01:48:18.053
- Fourteen hundred!
- That's it!

01:48:18.053 --> 01:48:20.514
- Fourteen hundred and fifty meters!
- That's it!

01:48:21.181 --> 01:48:22.098
Fifteen hundred!

01:48:22.724 --> 01:48:23.892
That's our target depth!

01:48:24.267 --> 01:48:25.101
We've reached it.

01:48:37.197 --> 01:48:38.448
We did it!

01:48:38.448 --> 01:48:40.033
We sunk Godzilla!

01:48:40.033 --> 01:48:41.493
Was that it?

01:48:49.251 --> 01:48:50.669
Guess the big guy won't quit.

01:48:51.378 --> 01:48:53.421
- We need to go to plan B.
- Yes, hurry.

01:49:12.482 --> 01:49:13.817
That's it, now rise!

01:49:14.859 --> 01:49:15.694
Depth:

01:49:15.902 --> 01:49:17.112
Twelve hundred meters!

01:49:17.112 --> 01:49:18.113
Eleven hundred!

01:49:18.697 --> 01:49:19.322
One thousand!

01:49:27.956 --> 01:49:29.207
The cables have stopped!

01:49:29.791 --> 01:49:32.377
The current depth is eight
hundred and three meters!

01:49:33.503 --> 01:49:34.629
What's wrong?

01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:35.380
Why's it stopping?

01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:41.469
It bit through it.

01:49:44.639 --> 01:49:45.515
Hibiki,

01:49:45.849 --> 01:49:47.017
we're going to have to pull Godzilla up!

01:49:47.017 --> 01:49:48.643
Maximum speed, ninety degrees!

01:49:48.643 --> 01:49:49.603
But sir

01:49:49.936 --> 01:49:51.938
even with both ships, we
don't have enough power.

01:49:51.938 --> 01:49:53.023
I don't give a damn!

01:49:53.481 --> 01:49:55.025
Give it all you can, gentlemen.

01:49:55.609 --> 01:49:56.651
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

01:50:13.335 --> 01:50:14.419
We can't keep going

01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:16.755
the cranes won't hold much longer!

01:50:16.755 --> 01:50:17.714
It's not working!

01:50:40.528 --> 01:50:44.366
Greetings! This is the
Fujimaru from Yokohama Eisen.

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.661
You boys look like you
could use some help!

01:50:47.661 --> 01:50:48.662
I know that voice.

01:50:50.246 --> 01:50:50.997
Mizushima here.

01:50:51.539 --> 01:50:52.540
Captain, are you there?
