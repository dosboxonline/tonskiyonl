00:04.700 --> 00:06.441
[gentle music]

00:14.623 --> 00:16.015
Did he finish his...

00:17.713 --> 00:18.453
What are you doing?

00:20.107 --> 00:23.893
Steve has little vocalization,
is fixated on ceiling fans,

00:23.936 --> 00:25.634
and makes eye contact
less than 10%.

00:25.677 --> 00:26.939
He's a baby.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.289
And as his daycare noted,

00:28.332 --> 00:30.421
he is not upset
when his parents leave.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.815
He's a happy baby.
That's not a symptom.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.208
Autistic children
often demonstrate

00:34.251 --> 00:36.036
less attachment
to significant...

00:36.079 --> 00:38.255
Shaun, you know a six-month-old

00:38.299 --> 00:40.301
cannot be diagnosed
with autism.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.260
Not definitively, but it is
important to look for signs.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.741
Which may not appear
for another 18 months.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.313
I would still like to consult
a pediatric neurologist.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.054
No. No matter what they say,

00:54.097 --> 00:55.577
you'll still be
looking for signs,

00:55.620 --> 00:56.969
you'll still be trying to
find out what's wrong with him.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.712
Not wrong. Just different.

01:02.845 --> 01:05.369
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:05.413 --> 01:06.240
It's just...

01:10.026 --> 01:12.420
I don't want to be
evaluating him

01:12.463 --> 01:14.987
every time he smiles
or he looks at a ceiling fan.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.902
I just want to enjoy the magic

01:16.946 --> 01:18.861
of watching our baby
experience the world.

01:21.777 --> 01:25.128
Ignoring the possibility
may help you feel better,

01:25.172 --> 01:26.521
but it will not help Steve.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.524
I have to go to work. Goodbye.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.221
[soft dramatic music]

01:38.054 --> 01:40.274
Can you grab more diapers
on the way home tonight?

01:40.317 --> 01:42.014
And salsa for Taco Tuesday.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.060
-Chunky, not the smooth kind.
-Yep.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.541
And can you skip your workout
tomorrow morning?

01:46.584 --> 01:47.890
It's leg day.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.500
We need to be
at the courthouse at 8:00 a.m.

01:49.544 --> 01:50.936
Courthouse?

01:50.979 --> 01:52.112
To get married.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.115
Our attorney says
a marriage license

01:55.158 --> 01:56.420
will expedite
the adoption process.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.987
We can carpool.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.250
I don't want to get married
as an item on your to-do list.

02:00.294 --> 02:03.210
Actually,
it's on our need-to-do list.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.473
Okay, this is more than
an administrative appointment.

02:05.516 --> 02:10.259
It needs music, flowers,
romance, something... special.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.436
I'll get you a boutonniere
and a harmonica.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.046
The other stuff
we don't have time for.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.309
Then we should make time.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.006
Just like I'm making time
for leg day.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.226
[door opens]

02:19.269 --> 02:20.749
[gasping]

02:20.792 --> 02:22.359
Did he swallow anything?

02:22.403 --> 02:23.969
No.

02:24.013 --> 02:26.885
He... He has asthma,
but his inhaler's not helping.

02:26.929 --> 02:28.191
Get a suprasternal view.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.281
Holy cow, he has a third arm.

02:34.805 --> 02:35.807
That's his aburo.

02:37.156 --> 02:38.636
His "little brother."

02:38.680 --> 02:40.812
-You speak Yoruba?
-My father's Nigerian.

02:40.856 --> 02:44.728
I only speak six words.
Seven counting aburo.

02:44.773 --> 02:47.602
They say his little arm is
all that's left of his ibeji.

02:47.645 --> 02:48.994
His twin.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.214
Eight.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.563
-[monitor alarm beeping]
-[gasping intensifies]

02:52.607 --> 02:54.261
He's too constricted
to intubate.

02:54.304 --> 02:57.438
Okay, bag mask ventilate.
He needs a tracheostomy, stat!

02:57.481 --> 02:59.179
[tense music]

03:04.662 --> 03:06.273
[Jordan] Mason Landover, 41.

03:06.316 --> 03:08.492
Severe neck, back,
and extremity pain.

03:08.536 --> 03:11.321
[Dr. Park] I'm gonna feel for
tenderness along your spine.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.062
Anything that could be
causing this pain?

03:13.105 --> 03:14.281
Well, I just spent eight months

03:14.324 --> 03:15.847
on the
International Space Station.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.936
Whoa. Like, spacespace?

03:17.980 --> 03:19.808
Yeah, I'm a botanist.

03:19.851 --> 03:22.376
Studying the effects
of zero gravity on soybeans.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.465
[Spanish accent] Selected from
hundreds of others for the job.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.510
[Dr. Park] That could
explain the pain.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.643
Returning to Earth's gravity
puts enormous stress
on the joints.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.035
It was worth it.

03:30.949 --> 03:32.647
He can barely walk.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.606
And he's had a bunch
of other health problems
since coming back.

03:36.651 --> 03:37.652
Palpate arms and legs for pain.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.742
Low gravity
decreases bone mass.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.787
We should do a DEXA scan
to assess how much he's lost.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.528
-[cracks]
-Oh!

03:44.572 --> 03:46.226
-[moaning]
-[Dom] Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

03:47.749 --> 03:50.012
Skip the bone scan.
Let's head right to the OR.

03:50.055 --> 03:52.232
[breathing heavily]

03:53.581 --> 03:55.844
[ethereal version
of theme music playing]

04:03.373 --> 04:05.506
[monitor alarm beeping]

04:05.549 --> 04:06.420
[Shaun] Tracheostomy tube.

04:11.555 --> 04:12.513
[beeping, alarm stops]

04:14.384 --> 04:15.820
[Jared] And the bronchoscope
is in.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.040
Let's find out what's causing
his breathing problems.

04:18.082 --> 04:21.130
[Charlie] Have either of you
seen a third arm before
in person?

04:21.173 --> 04:23.045
[Shaun] I have seen
a third thumb,

04:23.088 --> 04:24.742
a third kidney,
and a third nipple.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.832
[Jared] Must be tough
for the kid, living with that.

04:27.876 --> 04:30.400
[Charlie] Not if he learns
to embrace his differences.

04:30.444 --> 04:33.577
[Shaun] Do you think we should
get Steve tested for ASD?

04:33.621 --> 04:35.579
[Charlie] Attempting
a diagnosis at Steve's age

04:35.623 --> 04:37.538
will likely lead
to a misdiagnosis,

04:37.581 --> 04:39.453
and then you'll likely
be disappointed

04:39.496 --> 04:41.368
if you discover that your child
is just typical.

04:41.411 --> 04:42.804
[Jared] Approaching
bifurcation.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.545
There it is.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.156
Constriction coming from
outside the trachea.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.291
[Shaun] Something very strange

04:51.334 --> 04:53.118
is going on
inside Tayo's chest.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.164
[gentle music]

04:58.558 --> 04:59.734
Hey.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.953
So, your recovery is going
very nicely.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.390
We can discharge you now.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.305
Oh. Cool.

05:08.003 --> 05:08.873
What's next for you?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.614
Like?

05:10.658 --> 05:13.574
Like? Like, where are
you gonna be living?

05:13.617 --> 05:15.010
What are you gonna do
for money?

05:15.053 --> 05:16.664
Do you have any friends
out there that can help you?

05:17.621 --> 05:18.361
I'll be okay.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.148
Uh, I just need something
for the pain.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.412
I can give you Tylenol.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.675
No, that's not gonna be enough.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.772
Hannah, you just had
a very successful surgery.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.514
Your neuro exam
is completely normal now.

05:40.557 --> 05:41.993
You don't need
anything stronger.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.126
Yes, I do. I do.

05:45.780 --> 05:46.824
You just want the oxy?

05:46.868 --> 05:48.522
Yeah, because I'm in pain.

05:48.565 --> 05:49.349
Because you're an addict.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.613
Thank you for everything.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.356
Hold on. Hold on, Hannah.
Hold on a second.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.011
I'm just trying to help here.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.624
[clicks tongue]

06:03.667 --> 06:04.364
Are you hungry?

06:07.497 --> 06:08.368
I could eat.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.371
Great.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.460
[monitor beeping]

06:13.503 --> 06:15.462
[Dom] I-I can't believe
I broke his arm.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.115
[Dr. Park] Not your fault.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.335
He must have lost
a lot of bone mass in space.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.469
[Jordan] Do you and Morgan
still need me to watch Eden
tomorrow morning

06:22.512 --> 06:24.209
while you get married?

06:24.253 --> 06:26.821
[Dr. Park] No.
Because we're not getting
married tomorrow morning.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.518
You can place the last screw.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.346
[Jordan] I don't know much
about weddings,

06:30.390 --> 06:33.567
but it seems like agreeing on
a date is a prerequisite.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.177
[monitor alarm beeping]

06:35.220 --> 06:36.787
[Dom] He's in V-tach
and hypotensive.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.528
[Dr. Park] Push lidocaine.

06:38.572 --> 06:39.790
He's coding.
Defibrillator pads.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.621
-150. Clear.
-[paddles whine]

06:47.885 --> 06:49.496
Charge to 200.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.409
-[paddles whine]
-Clear.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.284
[alarm stops]

06:55.327 --> 06:56.633
[Jordan] Normal sinus rhythm.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.505
[Dom] Did I almost kill him?

06:58.548 --> 07:00.071
[Dr. Park] No.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.421
But we need to figure out
what almost did.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.772
[tense music]

07:07.427 --> 07:09.385
Tayo doesn't have asthma.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.734
Because of his third arm,

07:10.778 --> 07:12.301
he has an unusually large
blood vessel

07:12.344 --> 07:14.564
compressing his trachea
and constricting his air flow.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.305
We placed a tracheal stent
to relieve the pressure,

07:16.348 --> 07:18.350
but that is a temporary fix.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.135
We can't remove the vessel

07:20.178 --> 07:22.442
because that supplies blood
to both left-side arms.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.660
But we can't leave it as it is

07:23.704 --> 07:25.314
because he can't
breathe properly.

07:25.357 --> 07:28.273
We need to remove
one of his arms.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.710
A blood-flow test will--

07:29.753 --> 07:32.234
We talked about this.
His big arm should go.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.715
We talked. We never agreed.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.630
I want to remove
the little arm.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.894
The big arm can't hold a pencil
or squeeze a hand or--

07:39.937 --> 07:41.765
The little arm
is not much better.

07:41.808 --> 07:43.463
He doesn't want to lose
his little brother.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.726
Without his big arm,

07:45.769 --> 07:46.901
do you know how odd
he will look?

07:46.944 --> 07:48.642
Okay. Stop talking.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.557
We need to do
a Doppler ultrasound

07:50.600 --> 07:51.775
to test the blood flow.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.081
That is how we will choose.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.865
[gentle music]

08:04.832 --> 08:07.182
The echo showed he has
a dilated heart chamber.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.966
It's causing arrhythmias.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.186
We'll have to implant
a defibrillator.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.275
Is this
from being in space, too?

08:13.318 --> 08:14.711
[Dr. Park] Most likely.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.931
In zero gravity, the heart
can weaken significantly.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.323
[sighs]

08:18.367 --> 08:20.761
Ana, I'm gonna be fine.

08:20.804 --> 08:21.849
They warned me
my body would change.

08:22.806 --> 08:23.764
Not just your body.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.418
Let's talk about this later.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.117
Mason's been
a totally different person

08:29.160 --> 08:31.119
since his return.

08:31.162 --> 08:34.209
I think something's off
with him mentally.

08:34.251 --> 08:37.255
What's off about wanting
more time with you?

08:37.299 --> 08:41.650
More time with me means
I give up a dream fellowship
in Buenos Aires,

08:41.695 --> 08:45.046
so we can both stay here
and take care of the children
you now suddenly want?

08:45.089 --> 08:48.005
Being up there made me realize
what's important.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.181
Putting down roots,
starting a family.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.013
So, give me a brain scan.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.537
Show her this isn't
just some tumor talking.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.323
We need a medical reason.

09:01.366 --> 09:02.890
Marital disputes don't count.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.024
Right now we need to implant
the defibrillator.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.550
[contemplative music]

09:12.508 --> 09:13.553
[bell dings]

09:14.902 --> 09:15.990
So, what's your sport?

09:17.861 --> 09:20.168
Your jacket. It's yours, right?

09:20.211 --> 09:23.867
Oh! Um, yeah. Uh, track.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.216
Ah.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.435
Four-by. I ran anchor.

09:27.784 --> 09:28.916
What's your PR in the hundred?

09:30.395 --> 09:32.484
12.2.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.486
12.2? That's like
scholarship speed.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.402
UC Davis
offered me a full ride.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.404
Huh.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.406
It meant having to live
in Davis.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.539
[chuckles]

09:43.583 --> 09:45.149
Are you a big fan of track
or something?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.194
I used to be.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.589
What about your folks?
They live around here?

09:51.939 --> 09:53.897
[sighs] You ask
a lot of questions.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.552
Okay, well, let me see if I can
answer some of them.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.554
You're living on the street.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.862
You're panhandling
or, worse, stealing,

10:01.905 --> 10:04.429
and you have absolutely no one
who can help you.

10:05.822 --> 10:09.043
Well, I live
in an '04 Dodge Neon

10:09.086 --> 10:10.740
with a really sweet
rear spoiler.

10:10.784 --> 10:14.091

This new surgery
is much more complicated.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.772
There is a small chance
that Tayo will be left with
only one working arm.

But Tayo
could end up worse off.

a proper-sized arm that works.

my first marriage

When I thought you were dying,

36:51.209 --> 36:52.688
I had my own Overview Effect.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.041
A world without you
would be so cold.

36:59.695 --> 37:00.696
So empty.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.051
I don't need to take
that fellowship
in Buenos Aires.

37:10.358 --> 37:11.794
But I'm not sure
about the kids.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.102
Maybe we can start
with a puppy.

37:15.145 --> 37:18.061
No, no.
W-We're going to Bueno Aires.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.237
I-I'll take a sabbatical.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.543
And the puppy.

Thank you, Dr. Murphy,
for your advice.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.086
When you snapped at us
to stop fighting.

37:43.130 --> 37:46.699
Simple, direct, and very wise.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.267
It is very good advice.

[serene music]

38:08.503 --> 38:09.548
Tayo.

38:36.139 --> 38:37.227
You OD'd.

38:38.228 --> 38:39.229
In my house.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.365
Must have been fentanyl
in those pills.

38:48.630 --> 38:49.327
I'm sorry.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.506
You have any idea
how lucky you are?

38:54.549 --> 38:57.465
That I happened to come home
when I did,

38:57.509 --> 39:01.382
that I happened to have
naloxone in the house,

39:01.426 --> 39:03.341
that there wasn't more fentanyl
in those damn pills?

39:12.001 --> 39:13.002
This can't happen again.

39:17.572 --> 39:18.617
I'll go.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.097
No, no, no.

39:21.141 --> 39:22.185
That's not what I meant.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.976
I'm gonna write you
a prescription of oxycodone.

39:31.804 --> 39:32.805
Really?

39:35.503 --> 39:36.722
I can deal with you
being an addict.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.377
I can't deal with you
being dead.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.860
You can stay here
until we figure out
a way to get you better.

39:46.906 --> 39:49.387
I'm gonna give you
each pill on a schedule.

39:50.518 --> 39:51.563
No more scores on the street.

39:54.217 --> 39:55.393
Can't you get in trouble?

39:57.699 --> 39:58.874
You let me worry about that.
