00:01.479 --> 00:02.872
<i>Previously on</i>
The Good Doctor...

00:02.872 --> 00:04.961
- Hey! Stop!
- Danny!

00:08.573 --> 00:09.618
Just promise me.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.837
- What?
- No opioids.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.317
He asked you not to do that.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.840
He's tachycardic
and hypertensive
because of the pain.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.972
He's going into shock.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.800
- He's not. He's praying.
- He's dying.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.194
Forgive me.

00:20.194 --> 00:22.413
I need to go back to Texas
with my family.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.937
<i>You made an error
in yesterday's craniotomy.</i>

00:24.937 --> 00:26.983
You closed
with only eight sutures.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.506
The size of the wound
required ten.

00:28.506 --> 00:29.551
We need to figure out why.

00:29.551 --> 00:30.682
I've had a stroke.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.380
Yes. A small one.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.947
Dr. Glassman, please tell us
what the next step is.

00:34.947 --> 00:37.211
Somebody
please call security.
Shaun, you are out of line.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.734
- Answer.
- It's, um...

00:40.518 --> 00:43.695
You humiliated me in public
in my operating room

00:43.695 --> 00:45.262
in front of my colleagues.

00:45.262 --> 00:46.916
Do you have any idea
how much that hurt?

00:46.916 --> 00:48.483
I don't know what to do.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.354
You can just leave me alone.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.313
I don't think
you should resign.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.923
Because you don't
have to do it all alone.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.664
You're the reason
I wake up in the morning,

00:55.664 --> 00:57.318
so whatever there is
to figure out,

00:57.318 --> 01:00.538
all I want in the world
is for us to do it as a family.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.758
I wanted to give you
a heads-up as a friend.

01:02.758 --> 01:03.672
I've decided to resign.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.502
Congratulations,
Mom and Dad.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
Look at what we made.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.075
Do you think
Dr. Glassman is coming?

01:16.511 --> 01:18.252
This is from Dr. Glassman.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.558
How did he know
his name would be Steve?

01:20.558 --> 01:21.777
Because he knows you.

01:30.307 --> 01:31.265
Gloves.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.236
Start the timer, please.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.718
Good luck, babe. It's a doozy.

Good work.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.022
I think that was
your fastest yet.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.067
Second-fastest.

02:37.766 --> 02:41.422
Fifteen minutes
of independent play
is starting now.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.685
I will log it into my app.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.296
You sure you don't want to
get in a few extra snuggles
before you leave?

02:46.296 --> 02:48.603
Oh, I had ten minutes
of snuggles this morning.

02:48.603 --> 02:49.647
Very nice.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.434
I've also set up the app
on your phone.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.826
It will alert you
when it's time

02:54.826 --> 02:56.698
for Steve's nap,
feeding, playtime...

02:56.698 --> 02:59.657
Just in case I miss
the schedules
posted on the fridge,

02:59.657 --> 03:01.877
the bathroom,
and in our bedroom.

03:01.877 --> 03:05.228
Yes. And I will be able to
track it while I'm at work.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.839
Steve and I
will be fine.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.058
Just enjoy your first day back.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.064
We can finish
reading the latest

03:15.064 --> 03:16.805
<i>Journal of Trauma
and Acute Care Surgery</i>

03:16.805 --> 03:17.588
when I get home.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.113
After this,
Steve should have at least

03:21.113 --> 03:22.463
five minutes of tummy time.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.247
Yesterday, he only logged
12 minutes,

03:24.247 --> 03:26.031
- which is three less than--
- I love you.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.686
Say hi to everyone for me.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.211
Okay. I love you, too.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.088
I will miss you both.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.916
I don't know why you need
three protein powders
for your smoothies.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.483
They do different things.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.791
She's barely taken an ounce.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.532
That's what the protein-powder
companies want you to believe.

04:31.532 --> 04:32.620
Are you holding her right?

04:33.534 --> 04:35.013
Yes.

04:35.013 --> 04:39.061
She needs to be upright with
her head properly supported.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.105
Good.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.760
And you mixed it enough?

04:42.760 --> 04:43.979
The same as always.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.503
She's not interested again.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.158
And she seems lethargic.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.901
I'll take her
to get checked out.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.300
Well, I'd like to come, too.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.303
Sure. You can carry this.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.748
Good morning.
How's Perez today?

05:13.748 --> 05:14.705
Don't know.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.534
It's almost 8:00 a.m.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.754
It's been "today"
for a whole eight hours.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.277
You two haven't
texted each other yet?

05:21.277 --> 05:23.714
We both decided we need space.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.150
He's focused on his recovery.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.109
I've got my life here.

05:27.109 --> 05:30.025
I fully support that.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.070
And your next chapter
begins tonight.

05:32.070 --> 05:35.813
You and me. Drinks, music,
questionable decisions.

05:35.813 --> 05:38.773
You and Jerome finally
got the surgery!

05:38.773 --> 05:40.427
You're no longer
joined at the hip?

05:40.427 --> 05:41.819
Jerome is obsessed
with some docuseries

05:41.819 --> 05:44.300
about one of the many sports
that I don't care about.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.084
Come on. It's been too long.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.608
I've been busy.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.131
You've been...

05:49.131 --> 05:50.611
mopey.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.787
Fine. I agree
to drinks and music,

05:52.787 --> 05:55.616
but I'm definitely a "maybe"
on questionable decisions.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.487
- All right.
We'll work up to it.
- Okay.

05:57.487 --> 05:58.967
We're going out tonight
for drinks,

05:58.967 --> 06:01.491
- starting a new chapter.
- That's right.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.102
We're calling it
"Bad decisions
with good friends."

06:04.102 --> 06:06.409
We're definitely
not calling it that.
Wanna join?

06:06.409 --> 06:07.976
No, thank you.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.154
Papa Murphy, welcome back.

06:12.154 --> 06:13.416
Pictures of Steve.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.200
I was just about to ask.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.464
This way,
I avoid the disruption
of pulling out my phone.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.945
Look at that smile!

06:20.945 --> 06:22.904
Just like his mom!

06:22.904 --> 06:25.776
He was pooping in that one.
Here he is... about to poop.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.169
Hmm. A theme develops.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.087
Aw.
He's got your eyes, Shaun.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.828
I need to find Dr. Lim.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.395
You may keep those.
I made enough for everyone.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.747
Marcus sends greetings
from Spain.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.836
Oh, I thought he was at a
meditation retreat in Vietnam.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.621
He was, and now he's walking
the Camino de Santiago.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.188
How nice for him.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.624
I'm two surgeons down

06:47.624 --> 06:49.757
with no one to approve
hiring a new one.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.324
I need the board to appoint
an interim president, stat.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.065
Just as long as
it's not O'Brien.

06:54.065 --> 06:55.763
They wouldn't.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.634
I heard from a staffer
who covers board meetings

06:57.634 --> 06:59.114
that his name's
on the shortlist.

06:59.114 --> 07:02.291
Ugh. Of the worst possible
candidates for the position.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.771
Good morning!
Pictures of Steve.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.816
Aww.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.252
You no longer have your cane.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.906
Yeah. PT said I was ready.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.255
I'm glad to have you back.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.648
I would like to join your case.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.566
He's adorable, Dr. Murphy.
Welcome back.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.395
Shaun, I'm thrilled to see you,

07:19.395 --> 07:20.962
but I'm not sure this is
the case where you want

07:20.962 --> 07:22.137
to start as a new dad.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.054
It is an exciting
and challenging surgery.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.408
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.541
Hello. I am Dr. Shaun Murphy,

07:34.541 --> 07:37.979
attending surgeon
and father of a baby boy.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.547
He is two weeks old,
and today is my first day back,

07:40.547 --> 07:42.200
but that will not affect
my performance

07:42.200 --> 07:43.463
as your son's doctor.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.204
Is it true there might be
a heart for Jack?

07:46.204 --> 07:49.338
Yes, but the heart
isn't available yet,

07:49.338 --> 07:50.687
and we may not get it
once it is.

07:52.036 --> 07:52.907
We've been through this before.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.084
Why isn't the heart
available yet?

07:56.084 --> 08:00.480
Well, the donor family is still
saying their goodbyes

08:00.480 --> 08:03.004
before they turn off
life support.

08:06.398 --> 08:09.227
Jack is an excellent match
for the donor heart,

08:09.227 --> 08:12.013
and his latest echo indicates
that his cardiomyopathy

08:12.013 --> 08:13.580
and overall cardiac function
has worsened,

08:13.580 --> 08:15.756
so he should be
at the top of the list.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.453
I just want to run
some additional tests

08:17.453 --> 08:18.672
to make sure
he's otherwise healthy.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.891
There is a problem.

08:20.891 --> 08:24.939
There is a small scratch,
likely from his fingernails,

08:24.939 --> 08:26.854
which has developed cellulitis
and an abscess.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.377
If the infection spreads
and he spikes a fever,

08:28.377 --> 08:30.727
Jack will be ineligible
for the transplant.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.903
We have to lance
and debride it right away.

08:45.002 --> 08:45.742
Morning.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.092
Hi.

08:50.094 --> 08:54.055
This is Steve, our son,
who is now two weeks old.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.666
Steve, this is the grumpy man
who lives down the hall

08:56.666 --> 08:57.928
and gave you
your favorite blanket.

08:59.713 --> 09:02.237
Shaun was very impressed
you guessed his first name.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.934
Wanna take a stab
at the middle?

09:05.849 --> 09:06.589
Aaron.

09:08.591 --> 09:09.723
I was lobbying
pretty hard for Bowie,

09:09.723 --> 09:11.768
because why not name your kid

09:11.768 --> 09:13.117
after the coolest person
who ever lived?

09:13.117 --> 09:14.728
But Shaun insisted.

09:16.381 --> 09:17.861
You should come over sometime.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.602
You two both grunt a lot
and make strange faces.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.911
I've got a lot going on, so...

09:25.521 --> 09:27.218
We live next door.
You have nothing going on.

09:29.046 --> 09:32.223
You're mad. And I get it.

09:32.223 --> 09:35.749
But are you really gonna ignore
Shaun and Steve and me forever?

09:35.749 --> 09:36.924
Is that the plan?

09:39.404 --> 09:41.363
I'm not ignoring you.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.582
And he's beautiful.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.847
Congratulations.

09:51.678 --> 09:52.722
I tried.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.076
Any cyanosis while eating?

09:59.076 --> 10:01.818
Maybe a hint of bluishness
on her lips last night.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.864
I haven't noticed anything.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.605
But given her prior surgery
and the Turner syndrome,

10:05.605 --> 10:07.084
I thought we should...

10:08.869 --> 10:10.435
The blood flow is reduced.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.962
It looks like
Eden's aortic stenosis

10:14.962 --> 10:16.746
has progressed more rapidly
than we were expecting.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.273
Can we put her
on beta blockers?

10:22.273 --> 10:26.234
We can try, but given
how dysplastic the valve is,

10:26.234 --> 10:28.323
I don't think
it will do much good.

10:28.323 --> 10:31.108
You'll want to get
more imaging,

10:31.108 --> 10:34.285
but I think Eden's gonna need
another surgery very soon.

10:48.212 --> 10:51.868
Cardiac MRI confirmed
severe narrowing of the valve,

10:51.868 --> 10:53.740
obstruction, and left
ventricular dysfunction.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.742
Eden needs a new aortic valve,

10:55.742 --> 10:58.353
or her heart failure
will get worse.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.312
Are you thinking mechanical
or cryopreserved homograft
for the replacement?

11:01.312 --> 11:03.619
Mechanical valve for a neonate
needs to be built,

11:03.619 --> 11:05.708
and it will require
future surgeries

11:05.708 --> 11:07.188
plus lifetime blood thinners.

11:07.188 --> 11:10.321
Cryopreserved valves risk
degeneration down the line,

11:10.321 --> 11:12.410
but it is a solid idea,

11:12.410 --> 11:13.803
especially as part
of the Ross Procedure.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.284
Possible complications?

11:16.284 --> 11:19.156
Aortic insufficiency,
pulmonary stenosis.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.466
We can take some time,
discuss the different options--

11:24.466 --> 11:26.163
Do the Ross Procedure.

11:32.474 --> 11:33.736
I'll have Asher
get her prepped.

11:44.268 --> 11:46.357
It's time to get off
the sidelines.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.750
I'm not sure
what you're referring to.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.925
Are you gonna throw me a ball?

11:48.925 --> 11:50.622
You've run the hospital before.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.015
You can handle
a few more months.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.365
I can,
but why would I want to?

11:54.365 --> 11:56.193
- That's a no?
- Yes.

11:56.193 --> 11:59.153
Get ready for
Interim President O'Brien.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.720
They would never.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.548
That's like
Mao meets Basil Fawlty.

12:03.548 --> 12:06.029
Wow. That's two obscure
<i>and</i> dated references.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.988
They're never gonna
move on O'Brien.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.686
Well, apparently,
he's on the board's shortlist.

12:10.686 --> 12:13.820
Throw your hat in the ring,
he won't stand a chance.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.605
My hat's
gonna stay on my head,
but I'll handle it.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.695
Okay, Jack.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.958
You know that little bump
behind your ear?

12:21.958 --> 12:24.047
We have to poke it
with something sharp,

12:24.047 --> 12:25.875
which will hurt,

12:25.875 --> 12:28.182
but we have to do it
so hopefully you can get
a new heart.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.927
But Mr. Snugglepuff is here
to keep you company.

12:37.234 --> 12:40.020
Asher said the taco truck
added chorizo to the menu,

12:40.020 --> 12:41.891
and it's bussin'.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.024
The next late night,
we should share an order.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.201
Not really my thing. Thanks.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.768
The sheet papoose is secure.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.422
Good. Dr. Kalu,
cradle the baby.

12:51.422 --> 12:54.686
Dr. Allen, sterilize the area
behind the ear.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.525
Okay, baby, don't look.

13:07.525 --> 13:10.833
His eyes are not yet
able to focus beyond
eight to twelve inches.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.888
The abscess
is pretty deep.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.325
It may take a while to heal.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.196
What about a wound vac?

13:26.196 --> 13:27.850
We don't have one small enough.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.071
It's okay.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.119
Maggots.

13:36.119 --> 13:39.209
How are those better than
just using antibiotics?

13:39.209 --> 13:41.516
Maggots work faster
to clear necrotic debris

13:41.516 --> 13:43.823
on account of
the antimicrobial nature
of their saliva

13:43.823 --> 13:46.086
and other digestive secretions.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.610
It's safe to put those bugs
on my baby?

13:48.610 --> 13:50.264
Larvae.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.874
These are
medical maggots.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.658
They've been
specially disinfected.
It's completely safe.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.618
I would use maggots on my son,
Steve, in this situation.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.143
That is unlikely to happen,

14:00.143 --> 14:02.015
but I hope the parallel
puts you at ease.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.714
Go ahead.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.020
Hmm!

14:14.375 --> 14:15.724
You want some coffee?

14:15.724 --> 14:17.944
Or I have a stash
of protein bars in my office.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.815
I'm fine, thanks.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.643
But if you want something,
go ahead.

14:31.653 --> 14:32.872
What's your family here for?

14:35.178 --> 14:38.355
A heart transplant, hopefully,
for our son, Jack.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.314
How old is he?

14:40.314 --> 14:41.837
Twelve weeks.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.927
Oh. My daughter, Eden,
is 11 weeks.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.668
She's having heart surgery
right now.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.323
Y'all will be in my prayers.

14:52.717 --> 14:53.893
Is this Jack's first surgery?

14:55.416 --> 14:57.244
He's had other procedures,

14:57.244 --> 14:59.115
but this would be his first
open heart surgery.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.117
If it happens.

15:05.078 --> 15:08.559
<i>When</i> it happens, I recommend
Biafine cream for post-op.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.997
It contains a natural compound
called trolamine.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.521
It really helped
with Eden's recovery.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.523
How many surgeries
has your daughter had?

15:15.523 --> 15:17.133
Uh, one. At seven weeks.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.787
Hmm.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.702
Eden and I are old hands.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.618
You're two
very resilient ladies.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.927
I'm Kate Pierce.
This is my husband, Owen.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.973
Morgan Reznick.

15:34.629 --> 15:35.760
Alex Park.

15:38.372 --> 15:39.590
Would you like to...

15:50.384 --> 15:53.604
Yeah! You can do it! Come on.

15:53.604 --> 15:56.172
Oh! There you go!

15:56.172 --> 15:58.435
You got it! You got it!

15:58.435 --> 16:00.350
You got it!

16:00.350 --> 16:02.439
Hi, Daddy. How is it
being back at work?

16:02.439 --> 16:03.832
I just applied maggots
to a baby

16:03.832 --> 16:05.442
a few months older than Steve.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.792
Is that Steve?

16:07.792 --> 16:10.447
He is supposed to be asleep.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.232
<i>Mm. He's doing well
with tummy time.</i>

16:12.232 --> 16:14.843
And you mentioned yesterday
he was behind,

16:14.843 --> 16:17.280
so I thought I'd add
a few extra minutes.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.803
No, no.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.719
Tummy time should not be
extended into his sleep window.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.852
Did you not get the app alert?

16:23.852 --> 16:25.854
<i>You are seven minutes
into nap time.</i>

16:25.854 --> 16:29.075
Nope. I guess I missed it.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.511
<i>Delaying his nap could
make him overtired</i>

16:30.511 --> 16:32.687
or delay his next feeding.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.428
The schedule is very important.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.821
I know, Shaun, I know.
It's just a few extra minutes.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.258
<i>Eight minutes.</i>

16:38.258 --> 16:39.868
<i>That is not a few.
It is several.</i>

16:41.739 --> 16:43.611
Uh, I should go put Steve down.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.657
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>
- Okay.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.444
Oh.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.841
We had to abort the procedure.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.669
Eden has a bicuspid
pulmonary valve.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.889
There wasn't enough tissue
to attach it to the aorta.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.935
And we observed
leaking at the valve.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.767
Her heart is failing
even faster than we thought.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.030
I'm so sorry.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.163
What's our next move?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.256
Oh. The maggots worked!

17:20.256 --> 17:21.475
Baby Jack's infection
has cleared,

17:21.475 --> 17:23.042
and the heart
is on its way here.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.696
Eden has two bad valves

17:25.696 --> 17:27.263
and rapidly progressing
heart failure.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.963
We have one donor heart
and two babies who need it.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.148
It's up to us to decide
which baby gets this heart.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.975
Jack has been waiting
for three months.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.673
A transplant
is his only option.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.762
He could go on a VAD until
another heart is available.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.677
That could take months.
And a VAD isn't a good option
for Jack because of the--

17:49.677 --> 17:51.548
Morgan. Morgan.

17:53.507 --> 17:54.943
You can't be here.
Neither of you.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.771
I can't be anywhere else,

17:56.771 --> 17:58.251
so either someone
should sedate me or...

17:59.295 --> 18:00.731
Well, that can be arranged.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.388
It's only a problem
that Park and I are here

18:05.388 --> 18:07.869
if we influence your decision,
so don't let us.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.480
I won't say a word.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.141
Dr. Kalu?

18:19.141 --> 18:20.316
Yeah, um...

18:21.970 --> 18:23.841
as far as the VAD for Jack,
he's underweight,

18:23.841 --> 18:25.713
so a high risk
of complications,

18:25.713 --> 18:27.367
infections, bleeding, stroke.

18:27.367 --> 18:30.196
It's not a great option
for Eden, either.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.287
Eden can go on ECMO
while we're waiting

18:34.287 --> 18:36.245
for mechanical
replacement valves.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.726
ECMO has risks, especially for
a baby with Turner syndrome.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.031
And the longer she's on it,

18:40.031 --> 18:42.643
the greater the risk
of serious complications.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.340
The valves may not
get here in time.

18:48.431 --> 18:49.563
Care to weigh in, Dr. Murphy?

18:53.219 --> 18:57.048
Jack and Eden
are equally good matches

18:57.048 --> 19:00.139
to the donor heart
based on size and blood type.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.317
Anything else?

19:09.583 --> 19:10.279
It's okay, Shaun.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.028
Without this heart...

19:21.769 --> 19:23.074
Jack will die.

19:25.033 --> 19:28.428
Eden may also die without it.

19:28.428 --> 19:29.951
But she has other options.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.433
They are risky,
but they are options.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.220
Jack should get the heart.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.361
We'll put Eden on ECMO tonight.

19:50.798 --> 19:54.105
And I'll contact Abbott
about getting the
15-millimeter valves ASAP.

20:05.073 --> 20:08.642
Hey. I'm sorry.
Can we rain-check tonight?

20:08.642 --> 20:11.340
I'm exhausted,
and Jerome promised

20:11.340 --> 20:12.254
that we could watch
a nice crime procedural.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.432
Sometimes you need
a case of the week.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.217
Yeah.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.219
Mm-hmm.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.441
Mmm! My favorite!

20:25.441 --> 20:28.052
One cheddar brisket
with mild sauce

20:28.052 --> 20:31.186
so little Steve's next meal
doesn't burn his mouth.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.275
You are a treasure.
I am starving.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.322
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.891
Poor Eden,
having to go on ECMO.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.502
And poor Morgan and Park.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.200
It's... been a day.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.811
And how are you holding up?
Without Perez?

20:51.815 --> 20:56.298
Everything that happens,
at home or at work,

20:56.298 --> 20:58.257
he's the first person
I want to tell.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.258
Mm-hmm.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.782
And I can't.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.262
Or I shouldn't.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.394
I really miss him.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.441
You can tell <i>me</i> everything.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.791
If it's too surgical,
I may not understand it,

21:10.791 --> 21:14.055
but I am excellent at nodding
and acting interested.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.361
Mm!

21:16.536 --> 21:18.407
I'm here for you. So is Asher.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.629
What's going on?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.545
Tell me.
Babies are terrible at gossip.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.158
Asher and I were supposed
to hang out tonight,

21:30.158 --> 21:31.551
just the two of us.

21:31.551 --> 21:34.031
Do you need to check on him?

21:34.031 --> 21:35.816
No. If he smells me,
I'll never get out of there.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.165
He'll settle back down.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.341
So you and Asher had plans--

21:39.341 --> 21:41.735
He blew me off for Jerome

21:41.735 --> 21:44.564
because he had a hard day
on Eden's case, which I get,

21:44.564 --> 21:45.956
but I had a hard day, too.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.958
Mm-hmm.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.353
Steve's not settling.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.573
Well, he can wait a minute.
You had a hard day, too?

21:53.573 --> 21:56.184
It... It just seems like
everybody has someone except--

22:00.231 --> 22:01.929
- Go.
- I am so sorry.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.757
I-I will be right back.
I swear.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.412
Mm.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.382
You didn't
have to do this, Shaun.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.256
I am more thorough than
anyone else in this hospital.

22:28.651 --> 22:29.348
Starting ECMO.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.892
I just got an e-mail
from Gail on the board.

22:51.892 --> 22:54.938
I'm suddenly a top candidate
for interim president?

22:54.938 --> 22:56.070
You're welcome.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.073
I don't want that job.

22:59.073 --> 23:02.293
It's better...
better you than O'Brien.

23:02.293 --> 23:03.904
You're a good manager,
you're...

23:03.904 --> 23:05.601
you're well-respected,

23:05.601 --> 23:07.647
and, you know,
as a diverse woman...

23:07.647 --> 23:09.039
People aren't diverse.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.780
I'm part of an
underrepresented group.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.042
Right. That.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.174
Makes you an ideal candidate.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.698
Look. Gail loved the idea.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.178
- I hate you.
- You're welcome.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.575
Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.318
I am glad
to see you, Steve,

23:27.318 --> 23:29.320
but you are not
supposed to be awake.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.279
Yeah, I-I fell asleep
during his afternoon nap.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.846
We didn't wake up until 4:30.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.022
You need to set an alarm.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.067
The schedule is very important.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.069
I know. I know.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.293
Tomorrow I am doing
a heart transplant

23:45.293 --> 23:47.251
on a 12-week-old baby.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.384
Okay. You need sleep.

23:49.384 --> 23:50.820
Yes, I do.

23:50.820 --> 23:54.694
Go to bed.
I'll handle Steve tonight.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.957
I-I don't think I can.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.872
Shh, it's okay. What about your
noise-canceling headphones?

23:58.872 --> 24:01.788
I fall asleep on my side.
I cannot do that in those.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.833
Maybe you could go spend
the night at Glassman's?

24:03.833 --> 24:06.314
No.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.229
What about your office?
Can you sleep there?

24:55.494 --> 24:57.670
We can save them both
with one heart.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.331
It's called
a domino transplant.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.682
Jack's heart is failing,
but his valves are healthy,

25:09.682 --> 25:11.945
so when Jack receives
the donor heart,

25:11.945 --> 25:14.034
we will use his valves to
replace Eden's damaged ones.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.818
A fresh homograft donor
means Eden won't need

25:15.818 --> 25:17.777
multiple surgeries
or blood thinners.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.953
One heart could save
both babies.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.651
What are the chances
of valve failure?

25:22.651 --> 25:24.610
Minimal. Jack's valves
are very functional

25:24.610 --> 25:26.350
despite his cardiomyopathy.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.352
The odds of success are high.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.224
It's the best option we have...

25:31.138 --> 25:32.139
for Eden.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.403
And for Jack?

25:35.403 --> 25:38.406
We would
have to be very careful
while removing his heart

25:38.406 --> 25:40.190
so as not to damage his valves.

25:40.190 --> 25:43.063
That would mean
more time on bypass,

25:43.063 --> 25:44.717
which means a greater risk
of bleeding or infection.

25:46.196 --> 25:47.763
It's a lot to ask.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.722
They can always say no.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.898
What would <i>you</i> say?

26:05.825 --> 26:07.783
You haven't eaten anything
in 24 hours.

26:07.783 --> 26:08.741
I'm fine.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.223
No matter what they decide,
we'll get through this.

26:13.223 --> 26:14.442
Don't.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.183
What, try to help?

26:16.183 --> 26:18.925
Yes, exactly.
It's pointless and annoying.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.973
You know, I get that you don't
think of Eden as mine yet,

26:23.973 --> 26:25.801
and that's why you
haven't included me

26:25.801 --> 26:28.325
in any of her
medical decisions.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.023
Not that I need that,

26:30.023 --> 26:31.981
or disagree
with any of your choices--

26:31.981 --> 26:33.548
Is pissing me off another
attempt to distract me?

26:33.548 --> 26:35.245
I'm not trying to pick a fight.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.639
I just want you to know
that I love that girl

26:37.639 --> 26:39.075
like she's my own, and...

26:40.947 --> 26:42.513
I'm as scared as you are.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.646
And I wish you'd let me
help you because...

26:46.953 --> 26:48.824
we're in this together.

26:48.824 --> 26:49.651
That's it.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.786
And I really don't
want you to pass out,

26:53.786 --> 26:55.265
so please eat
or drink something.

27:04.927 --> 27:08.278
If our baby
can save your baby's life,
we'd be honored.

27:18.332 --> 27:21.291
"I'll love you forever,

27:21.291 --> 27:23.380
I'll like you for always.

27:23.380 --> 27:27.123
"As long as I'm living,
my baby you'll be."

27:32.781 --> 27:35.697
Oh, my God. What a tear-jerker.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.919
We need to find one of
Daddy's medical journals.

27:39.919 --> 27:41.442
<i>Reminder.</i>

27:41.442 --> 27:43.139
<i>Nap time in five minutes.</i>

27:49.624 --> 27:52.671
How do I un-sync the baby app
from our speaker?

27:52.671 --> 27:55.586
Oh, no. You should not do that.

27:55.586 --> 27:58.111
I set it up so you can
remember the schedule.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.940
When it's just me and Steve
home during the day,

28:00.940 --> 28:04.160
I like to be
a little bit more... flexible,

28:04.160 --> 28:05.379
go with the flow.

28:05.379 --> 28:07.207
I'll just...
I'll just unplug it.

28:07.207 --> 28:10.471
It has a battery
in case of power outages.

28:10.471 --> 28:14.301
Lea, when I'm at work,

28:14.301 --> 28:16.738
I like knowing what
you and Steve are doing.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.915
It makes me feel like I am
still a part of his day.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.614
And when Steve gets off
his sleep schedule,

28:23.614 --> 28:25.094
I have to go sleep
at the hospital,

28:25.094 --> 28:27.531
and I miss you both even more.

28:27.531 --> 28:30.665
Aw, we missed you, too.
How did you sleep?

28:30.665 --> 28:34.538
Not well. But I came up
with a very good idea
to save both babies.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.671
I have to go prep
for my surgery now.
I love you.

28:36.671 --> 28:39.282
Dr. Lim, we have
a meeting to review--

28:39.282 --> 28:41.197
One minute, Shaun.

28:41.197 --> 28:44.723
Gail, of course,
diversity and representation
should be considered,

28:44.723 --> 28:46.420
but given this is
an interim position,

28:46.420 --> 28:48.770
I think the top priority
is finding someone

28:48.770 --> 28:51.077
who can hit the ground running
from day one.

28:51.077 --> 28:52.774
And that means someone
who's done it before.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.863
He's too modest
to sing his own praises,

28:54.863 --> 28:56.735
but I think
he's the obvious choice.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.302
Hmm. Compelling argument.
Thank you.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.608
Oh.

29:01.914 --> 29:06.396
And seniors are also
an underrepresented group.

29:06.396 --> 29:09.138
<i>Dr. Murphy and I
will start with Jack in OR 1.</i>

29:09.138 --> 29:11.880
Asher, you'll be with Eden
next door getting her ready.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.665
Allen and Kalu, you two
will receive the donor heart

29:14.665 --> 29:15.928
and prep it for transplant.

29:15.928 --> 29:19.453
Then Dr. Lim and I
will put Jack on bypass

29:19.453 --> 29:21.194
and start cooling him
to 25 degrees.

29:21.194 --> 29:23.370
Given his age and underlying
medical condition,

29:23.370 --> 29:27.200
he should not be on bypass
for longer than two hours.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.072
Putting in Jack's new heart
will take about 90 minutes.

29:30.072 --> 29:33.119
That leaves us half an hour
to remove the old one.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.295
While Shaun is transplanting
the new heart,

29:35.295 --> 29:37.558
I will be excising
Jack's valves.

29:37.558 --> 29:39.473
We have zero room for error.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.476
Prep your patients.

29:47.046 --> 29:48.047
Exciting case.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.006
Yep.

29:52.355 --> 29:53.748
We're saving
two babies at once,

29:53.748 --> 29:55.663
and your commentary is "yep"?

29:57.447 --> 29:58.579
I was agreeing with you.

29:58.579 --> 30:00.233
With as few words as possible,

30:00.233 --> 30:02.496
which you've been doing
for the last two weeks.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.892
If you have a problem with me,
just tell me.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.199
Okay.

30:11.505 --> 30:12.854
Okay. I have a problem with you

30:12.854 --> 30:14.508
and how you handled
Perez's case.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.771
- That's completely stupid.
- You just said
I should tell you.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.294
I didn't say
I would agree with you.

30:18.294 --> 30:19.905
You overrode
our patient's wishes,

30:19.905 --> 30:20.819
and Perez is gone
because of it.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.603
Perez is <i>alive</i> because of it.

30:22.603 --> 30:23.865
You don't know what
would have happened
if you'd listened to him.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.042
You made the decision
you thought was best.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.305
Didn't matter
what anyone else wanted.

30:29.305 --> 30:30.959
I'm sorry,
but you don't get to do that

30:30.959 --> 30:32.526
and not deal
with the consequences.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.789
The consequences?

30:34.789 --> 30:36.835
I lost someone
I care about a lot,

30:36.835 --> 30:38.271
and I miss him every day.

30:40.273 --> 30:43.493
I'm really trying hard to focus
on the good things in my life,

30:43.493 --> 30:45.321
the job I love,

30:45.321 --> 30:47.671
the friends I <i>thought</i> I had...

30:49.412 --> 30:53.721
But it feels like
everyone is moving on,
and I'm just alone.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.683
Spare yourself the burden
of punishing me.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.692
Get her prepped,
draped, and under anesthesia.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.477
I'll see you in 30 minutes, hopefully.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.319
I had an extra set.

31:28.190 --> 31:30.323
You don't have to be Catholic.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.542
They can just be a reminder
that you're not alone.

31:35.023 --> 31:35.981
Thank you.

32:00.483 --> 32:03.834
There is
a lot of scar tissue
to dissect through.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.749
The cardiomyopathy has caused
Jack's heart to enlarge

32:05.749 --> 32:07.751
and adhere to his chest wall.

32:09.014 --> 32:11.146
This will take
longer than planned

32:11.146 --> 32:13.409
in order to
preserve the valves.

32:13.409 --> 32:14.889
We inspected
the mitral valve.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.109
The atrial septum is intact.
The heart looks good.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.937
Dr. Allen,
connect the pulmonary veins

32:18.937 --> 32:19.894
to prep the left atrial cuff.

32:19.894 --> 32:20.982
Dr. Kalu, you're with us.

32:23.550 --> 32:26.770
Okay. Increase flows
and cool to 25 degrees.

32:26.770 --> 32:27.989
Start the clock.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.214
Come on, Peanut.

32:35.214 --> 32:37.694
We went with the flow,
but now it's nap time.

32:37.694 --> 32:40.175
Come on. Settle.

32:41.002 --> 32:41.960
Oh.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.489
Ohh! We were so close, Peanut.

32:49.489 --> 32:51.491
I need to transect
the aorta,

32:51.491 --> 32:54.320
but there are thick adhesions
where it meets the valve.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.452
You now only have
an hour and 14 minutes
to put the new heart in.

32:56.452 --> 32:59.673
The annulus
is at the tip of my dissection.

32:59.673 --> 33:02.719
If I nick that,
the aortic valve is useless.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.070
- Anterior retraction.
- We're running
out of time.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.288
Jack's transplant
is at serious risk.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.073
Metz.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.727
Dr. Murphy, you need to
abort this procedure.

33:10.727 --> 33:13.382
Shaun, ECMO is still
an option for Eden.

33:13.382 --> 33:14.993
- You need to abort--
- Got it!

33:20.694 --> 33:21.869
The valves are good.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.395
Ready for the donor heart.

33:32.749 --> 33:34.664
- How is she?
- Ready to go.

33:34.664 --> 33:35.970
Vitals are great.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.406
Open her chest
and start her on bypass

33:37.406 --> 33:39.060
while I recover the valves.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.628
Scalpel.
How do the valves look?

33:41.628 --> 33:43.673
A little bigger than
we measured on imaging.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.197
Makes the anastomosis challenging.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.373
But it can still work?

33:48.330 --> 33:49.505
It has to.

33:55.511 --> 33:56.382
Hmm.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.649
<i>Feeding time starting
in five minutes.</i>

34:02.649 --> 34:04.085
Shh.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.439
It's not
seating perfectly.

34:10.439 --> 34:12.006
Let's try
a purse string suture.

34:12.006 --> 34:13.486
7-0 Prolene.

34:22.538 --> 34:23.235
Got it. Saline.

34:28.196 --> 34:29.545
There's a paravalvular leak
at the aortic.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.680
How about
pledgeted sutures?

34:33.680 --> 34:36.509
In an infant this small,
that could cause stenosis.

34:36.509 --> 34:37.640
We try again.

34:39.381 --> 34:40.208
7-0 Prolene.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.082
It's been almost
two and a half hours.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.344
We need to get him off bypass.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.128
The aortic anastomosis
is complete.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.217
Unclamp the aorta
and start rewarming.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.307
Now what?

34:55.658 --> 34:58.096
We wait... and hope
his heart starts beating.

35:12.893 --> 35:15.113
It's been almost three hours.
Do you think something's wrong?

35:28.474 --> 35:30.519
The sutures
are holding.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.825
Now the little thing
just has to beat.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.611
Start warming her up.
Decrease the flows.

35:47.057 --> 35:47.797
We need to shock him.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.935
Clear!

36:00.593 --> 36:01.855
Again.

36:17.523 --> 36:19.873
The surgeries were successful.

36:19.873 --> 36:22.005
Both your babies
are doing very well,
and you can see them soon.

36:23.485 --> 36:24.965
Thank you.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.187
Thank you.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.886
You saved our daughter.

36:36.106 --> 36:37.195
You are welcome.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.677
I miss <i>my</i> baby.
I'm going home now.

36:50.338 --> 36:51.992
All right. Let me just
jump in the shower.

36:51.992 --> 36:53.515
And then I'm good to go.

36:53.515 --> 36:54.821
Go home to your man.

36:55.691 --> 36:56.997
It's okay.

36:57.824 --> 36:58.999
Bless you.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.043
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.107
You're right.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.023
This chorizo is...

37:23.850 --> 37:24.851
What'd you call it?

37:26.113 --> 37:27.201
Bussin'.

37:27.201 --> 37:28.246
Right.

37:29.464 --> 37:30.465
Definitely bussin'.

37:35.383 --> 37:37.342
I thought we could
share an order.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.182
Tell me you didn't forget
the hot sauce.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.370
- Hello.
- Hmm...

38:05.370 --> 38:07.241
Why is Steve awake?

38:08.808 --> 38:09.765
You look terrible.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.942
Thank you.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.772
Steve has been fed,
burped, changed,

38:16.772 --> 38:19.122
and woken
from his haphazard nap

38:19.122 --> 38:20.646
by a speaker reminder.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.824
How's Eden?

38:24.824 --> 38:27.653
Very good.
And Jack's transplant
was successful.

38:27.653 --> 38:30.003
Mm.

38:30.003 --> 38:32.397
Parenting can be very hard.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.486
Mm-hmm.

38:34.486 --> 38:36.792
Yeah. I've noticed.

38:36.792 --> 38:40.840
There are many hard choices

38:40.840 --> 38:44.104
about what works best.

38:44.104 --> 38:45.714
People want different things.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.240
I will try to...

38:53.200 --> 38:55.202
make room for your way.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.467
The schedule is important,

38:59.467 --> 39:01.339
but I will un-sync the app
from the speaker.

39:03.297 --> 39:04.994
I put it out
on the fire escape.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.607
Thank you.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.173
I really appreciate it.

39:13.220 --> 39:16.397
But the only room I need
right now is the bedroom.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.357
- Okay.
- Good night.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.969
I'm borrowing your
noise-canceling headphones.

39:22.969 --> 39:24.231
I love you both.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.599
Are you kidding me?
You recommended <i>me?</i>

39:44.599 --> 39:46.601
I was just following
your example.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.081
See? You're a natural leader.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.649
I'm old.
I'm worn out and I'm old.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.781
- You're <i>wise.</i>
- I remember rotary phones.

39:52.781 --> 39:54.827
You're vital.
You're experienced.

39:54.827 --> 39:57.307
You're the most
respected doctor
in this hospital.

39:57.307 --> 39:59.092
Aaron, you have
institutional knowledge

39:59.092 --> 40:02.095
and a... and a natural,
unexplainable gravitas.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.793
Will you please stop being
an idiot and just take the job?

40:04.793 --> 40:06.099
Stop being selfish
and stubborn.

40:06.099 --> 40:07.796
How am I being selfish? I'm...

40:07.796 --> 40:09.624
Oh, you're together.
That saves me a stop.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.846
Your recommendations
presented the board

40:13.846 --> 40:15.021
with a very difficult choice.

40:15.021 --> 40:17.806
So we didn't...

40:17.806 --> 40:19.634
choose.

40:19.634 --> 40:22.420
You two are the new
interim co-presidents

40:22.420 --> 40:23.812
of St. Bonaventure Hospital.

40:27.033 --> 40:28.382
Congratulations!

40:35.476 --> 40:38.305
This is not the schedule, Steve.

40:38.305 --> 40:41.090
Mommy needs to sleep.
Daddy needs to sleep.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.527
You need to sleep.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.225
Please?

40:46.313 --> 40:48.837
Please. We are both very tired.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.668
Please. We are both very tired.

40:53.668 --> 40:54.887
Hey.

41:04.505 --> 41:05.724
I don't know what to do.

41:05.724 --> 41:09.902
I can't go inside
because Lea needs to sleep.

41:09.902 --> 41:12.513
I've always been able
to get him down before.

41:14.210 --> 41:16.343
Sometimes babies
just need to cry.

41:21.783 --> 41:22.915
Hey. Um...

41:25.308 --> 41:27.354
why don't I take him?

41:27.354 --> 41:28.660
Get some sleep.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.753
It's okay. Just get some rest.

41:37.364 --> 41:39.497
I will just take a short nap.

41:42.935 --> 41:44.284
Take as long as you need.

41:46.721 --> 41:47.505
Hey.

41:50.159 --> 41:51.857
Hey. I got you. Hey.

41:53.162 --> 41:54.816
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:58.603 --> 42:00.039
I got you.

42:00.039 --> 42:02.171
Huh. I got you.

42:08.221 --> 42:09.570
I'm Grandpa...

42:11.224 --> 42:12.399
in case you were wondering.
