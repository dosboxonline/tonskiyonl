[Claire] <i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor…

00:03.294 --> 00:05.296
You don't want me to do anything.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.382
I spend every minute
of every day with you.

00:07.924 --> 00:11.928
Since you feel that our time together
is something to be endured,

00:12.011 --> 00:14.764
I decided to make that easier for you.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.559

[Dr. Park]
<i>I read about the CHILL study.</i>

00:21.271 --> 00:23.982
She's a good candidate.
I'll take full responsibility for her.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.859
<i>Tell him he's going to be fine.</i>

00:25.942 --> 00:26.943
I can't.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.613
The majority of COVID patients who go
on a ventilator never come off.

00:30.697 --> 00:31.781
Put on a mask. Now.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.992
<i>It's COVID. We've both been exposed.</i>

00:34.743 --> 00:36.494
My mother had a necklace.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.787
[Claire] <i>See if I can find it.</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:40.040
[Dr. Melendez] Things will be okay.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.302
Good morning.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.723
Morning, Shaun.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.435
I wish you were here.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.313
<i>Me, too.</i>

01:12.405 --> 01:13.948
[Nurse Petringa] Morning, Dalisay.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.950
Woke up with a temp of 104.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.495
I need heated,
humidified oxygen on a high-flow cannula.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.330
Mom, slow down.
Just let her examine you.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.166
Why, so she can
find out exactly what I just told her?

01:24.250 --> 01:26.461
Reznick. You're back.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.547
Got sick, got better, got tested twice.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.132
Always the overachiever.

01:31.216 --> 01:34.093
-[chuckles]
-Dr. Reznick, her pulse ox is 90.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.763
We need to admit you.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.516
Is my mom gonna be okay?

01:42.352 --> 01:44.187
Don't worry. I'm gonna be fine.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.524
Just please water my tomato plants,

01:48.191 --> 01:50.985
give Darcy a big hug,
and tell her Nana loves her so much

01:51.069 --> 01:53.196
and can't wait to play
with her again real soon.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.406
Okay, Mom.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.457
[Nurse Petringa] Nice hesitation.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.668
Why not just suggest
he get my house appraised?

02:09.838 --> 02:12.257
Sorry. It took a while to find it.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.967
[chuckles] Thank you.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.137
Being able to hold this
and keep it with me…

02:17.637 --> 02:18.638
It's a connection.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.144
Like she's still here with me.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.217
[mutters]

02:56.301 --> 02:58.469
It's stuff, Claire. It's meaningless now.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.762
[scoffs]

02:59.846 --> 03:02.390
Each one of these
tells an interrupted story,

03:03.391 --> 03:05.518
a voicemail that'll never be heard,

03:05.602 --> 03:08.271
a shopping list for a home-cooked meal
that'll never be made.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.023
Beautiful.

03:10.106 --> 03:13.526
Cook spaghetti carbonara for a dead guy's
family, and the grief is gone.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.446
Are you here to mock me or to help me?

03:17.947 --> 03:19.032
Why are you here?

03:32.211 --> 03:33.546
"Donald Sulkin."

03:37.383 --> 03:39.677
We're reducing the pressure
of air going into his lungs

03:39.761 --> 03:41.095
and watching his oxygen level.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.473
[monitor beeping]

03:44.015 --> 03:45.934
So far, so good. O2 steady.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.018
<i>Okay.</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:48.811
[monitor trills]

03:48.895 --> 03:52.065
Yes. But his end tidal CO2 is falling.

03:52.523 --> 03:53.942
<i>What… What does that mean?</i>

03:54.025 --> 03:56.361
It's not as bad as his O2 falling,
but still not good.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.570
[trills]

03:58.446 --> 04:00.323
Turn the pressure support back up.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.407
[monitors beeping]

04:02.825 --> 04:07.163
End tidal CO2 is very low, not improving.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.331
<i>What's going on?</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:14.045
I think he has a blood clot in his lung,

04:14.128 --> 04:16.089
interfering with his gas exchange.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.341
Give him a bolus of heparin,
start him on a drip.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.842
Let's get him to the cath lab.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.844
-Let's go.

[Dr. Park] This is isotonic saline,
salt water.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.817
It's 4 degrees Celsius.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.653
I'll run this into your bloodstream

04:39.821 --> 04:43.074
until your body temperature drops
to 34 degrees Celsius.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.495
The paralytic I gave you
will stop you from shivering

04:48.037 --> 04:50.665
while the cold slows your heart,
your brain,

04:51.249 --> 04:52.959
all metabolic functions.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.629
All the energy saved there
will go towards healing your lungs.

Yeah, yeah, I'm hunting
for the legendary Tusk of Ganesh

05:31.831 --> 05:34.250
at 3:00 in the morning
because everything's just super.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.962

I can't go to work.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.804
[Pete and boy] <i>Yeah.</i>

05:48.723 --> 05:50.892
It's like I killed a puppy or something.

Well, pulse ox is 82.

Everything else looks okay.

Sure, other than my steadily declining
oxygen levels,

-Oh.

"Don't tread on my right to kill you."

Mm. How about,

We haven't had a patient named Sulkin
in over 10 years.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.946
Being dead doesn't change

07:27.029 --> 07:28.906
because your loved one
gets a memento back.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.993
And fixating on dead people

07:32.994 --> 07:33.995
it's not a life.

are you trying to reach?

more things about this disease.

I love how she talks to him,
