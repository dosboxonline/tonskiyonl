WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:04.254
[crowd chanting "266!"]

00:04.963 --> 00:06.256
It's just an hour.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.299
Which really means an hour and a half,

00:08.383 --> 00:10.218
which means by the time we get to Jason's,

00:10.301 --> 00:12.178
-the party will be over.
-It's not a party.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.390
It's four boys arguing over who's gonna
play "Call of Duty's Warfare."

00:15.473 --> 00:19.102
Meanwhile, you're gonna be learning how to
exercise your First Amendment rights.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.854
-By waving signs at cars?
-Mm-hmm.

00:20.937 --> 00:23.606
And it's "Call of Duty"--
colon-- "Modern Warfare."

00:23.690 --> 00:26.901
Everyone who sees our signs
knows that they're not alone,

00:26.985 --> 00:28.820
and when we have numbers,
we have a voice.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.155
We are heard.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.323
At least someone's being heard.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.076
This is democracy, Ethan--
making a difference.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.328
This is how change happens.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.164
Yeah, well, change sucks.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.504
It's 10:30. I will have you
at Jason's by 11:45, okay?

00:46.588 --> 00:47.672
[scoffs]

00:47.756 --> 00:49.007
Ooh, I see a spot.

00:51.676 --> 00:52.677
Really?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.304
-[scoffs]
-Why'd you let her in?

00:54.387 --> 00:57.015
Because the idiot
would've smashed our car.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.560
How about we go get
milkshakes instead, hmm?

01:00.935 --> 01:03.605
But I spent three hours making signs.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.690
Ooh, there! There's a spot!

01:05.774 --> 01:07.609
[chanting continues]

01:08.610 --> 01:09.652
Sweet.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.988
[chanting continues]

01:12.072 --> 01:15.825
Any hint of trouble,
we are leaving, got it?

01:15.909 --> 01:18.620
Inspiring speech, Mom.
Very Vince Lombardi.

01:19.662 --> 01:20.955
I saw his hologram.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.251
Oh, here's your very own wristband.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.463
Solidarity!

01:29.339 --> 01:30.548
Yeah!

01:35.220 --> 01:36.846
Yes, they already did the finger prick

01:36.930 --> 01:37.972
and gave me the gloop.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.725
It's a 50-gram glucose solution.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.769
It was gloop, and it tasted awful.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.522
Gloop wouldn't tell us
if you have gestational diabetes,

01:45.605 --> 01:47.941
which is associated
with hypertension, preeclampsia,

01:48.024 --> 01:51.194
preterm labor, and for the baby,
respiratory issues and obesity.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.987
Before we buy jumbo baby clothes,

01:53.071 --> 01:54.489
let's get the test results, okay?

01:54.572 --> 01:56.116
Okay, will you text me when--

01:56.199 --> 01:57.575
Whoa.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.077
What's this?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.915
<i>We know at least</i>
<i>two people have been shot,</i>

02:03.998 --> 02:06.626
<i>but we have no information</i>
<i>on their status.</i>

02:06.709 --> 02:08.837
<i>By all reports, the rally</i>
<i>in support of Prop 266…</i>

02:08.920 --> 02:11.422
That is less than a mile from here.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.551
<i>-…was quite peaceful despite the presence.</i>
-[pager beeps]

02:14.634 --> 02:17.137
<i>But just about 20 minutes ago,</i>
<i>what witnesses described…</i>

02:17.220 --> 02:19.430
I have to go to the E.R., STAT.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.934
<i>…the passenger opening fire.</i>

02:23.017 --> 02:25.854
[siren wailing]

02:31.734 --> 02:33.736
[wailing continues]

02:36.823 --> 02:39.868
9-year-old boy with multiple
gunshots to chest and abdomen.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.036
He took three rounds of epi, still PEA.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.538
Trauma Bay 6. Checking ABCs.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.999
Asher, taking over compressions.
Claire, assess wounds.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.292
-You're the mom?
-[whimpers]

02:47.375 --> 02:49.544
-What's his name? Mason, got it.
-Mason.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.797
Entry wound left chest.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.424
[Dr. Andrews] Right over his heart.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.842
[Asher] Emergency thoracotomy?

02:55.925 --> 02:56.926
20 blade.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.971
We'll take good care of Mason,
but right now, you need to go.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.055
-I can't.
-Now.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.348
Rib spreader.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.518
We got a pumper.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.061
[monitor beeping rapidly]

03:07.145 --> 03:09.188
[Claire] I can't see a thing. Suction.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.732
[beeping continues]

03:11.983 --> 03:14.402
Hole in right ventricle.
I got my finger on it.

03:14.485 --> 03:15.612
That's stopped the bleed,

03:15.695 --> 03:17.822
but we gotta get the heart
pumping normally again.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.115
Urinary catheter.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.660
Stick it in the hole,

03:22.744 --> 03:24.913
inflate the balloon inside the ventricle,

03:25.496 --> 03:27.081
and occlude the hole.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.000
[beeping continues]

03:31.210 --> 03:33.296
-[beeping slows]
-We've got a regular heartbeat.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.007
Red cells, platelets transfusions.
Let's get him to the O.R.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.050
Very good, Dr. Browne.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.055
Kid took one gunshot to the head,
became unresponsive en route.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.223
Intubated him.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.724
He's bradycardic.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.977
[monitor beeping rapidly]

03:49.520 --> 03:50.605
Pupils are blown.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.607
No response to sternal rub.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.025
And the kid's leaking brain.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.610
Glasgow Coma Scale--
3T.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.696

Elevating head 30 degrees

All right, let's take him--
O.R. two.

[theme music playing]

04:25.223 --> 04:27.809
[reporter] <i>And we can now confirm</i>
<i>that the shooting victims</i>

04:27.892 --> 04:30.186
<i>were young boys,</i>

04:30.270 --> 04:32.647
<i>as both under 10 years of age.</i>

-What is it?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.063
-And Mrs. Bardo?
-What happened?

Nothing. I just need you
to fill out these forms.

Forms?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.319
Necessary evil.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.489
Do you have copies
of your insurance cards?

06:04.572 --> 06:08.409
Uh, no, I must've left mine.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.536
I work here in I.T.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.954
I'll help them with the forms.

Thank you.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.008
[Dr. Lim] This is not a happy brain.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.676
Let's clean out as much as we can.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.055
Scalp, hair, skull fragments.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.058
And let's not forget bullet shrapnel.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.351
Ultrasound.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.856
I'm looking
for any deeper bullet fragments.

Is he storming?

06:47.365 --> 06:48.407
Heart rate's way too low.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.163
We need to take off
his entire right skull.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.082
Drill with B1 bit.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.793

Uh, initial there.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.257
And sign here.

Lea.

I… I think that's the other mom.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.413
I'm Carina.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.166
Were you

07:38.791 --> 07:40.001
at the rally?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.714
Yeah. I'm Taryn.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.513
Mason's 9.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.600
Ethan's 8 1/2.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.063
They'll be fine.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.734
I know it.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.291
You're one of them.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.920
Them?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.839
Get away from me.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.845
[sighs]

08:42.104 --> 08:44.357
[Claire] It is so sad
that people can't express

08:44.440 --> 08:46.025
their views peacefully.

08:46.108 --> 08:49.529
The right is so intolerant
of political differences,

08:49.612 --> 08:50.821
any differences.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.699
[Dr. Andrews] I think there's some
intolerances on both sides.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.869
Oh, like there are good people
on both sides?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.997
What if I told you I belong to the NRA?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.583
[scoffs] I'd think you were
saying that to make a point.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.419
About five years ago, my wife and I went

09:05.503 --> 09:07.964
to a very trendy restaurant
in a very shady part of town,

09:08.047 --> 09:10.925
and on our way back to the car
we were mugged at gunpoint.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.261
The next day,
I bought us both handguns.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.762
I'm a card-carrying member.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.184
[Asher] I voted for Trump.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.644
[scoffs] Too soon.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.604
I'm serious.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.691
I liked his stand on Israel.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.819
But I've never told anyone

09:29.902 --> 09:31.779
because I'd be absolutely vilified.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.197
As you should be, especially you.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.657
Pooling up. He's hypotensive.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.741
Lactate's rising.

09:35.825 --> 09:36.951
Okay, crit's down to 17.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.703
We could put him
into deep hypothermia.

09:38.786 --> 09:41.038
No, the low temp would only
worsen his coagulopathy.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.166
-He just needs more blood.
-We've used most of the O-neg and A-neg

09:44.250 --> 09:46.919
-from the blood bank.
-Start calling other hospitals now.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.429
[Claire] You actually voted for Trump?

09:58.306 --> 09:59.307
[Asher] Once.

10:00.975 --> 10:01.809
And then what?

10:01.892 --> 10:04.312
You-- You--
You suddenly discovered

10:04.395 --> 10:06.897
he was exactly who he said he was?

10:06.981 --> 10:10.359
I don't feel like you want an answer.
I feel like you want an apology.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.697
[sighs] This kind of changes
how I feel about you.

10:15.948 --> 10:16.949
What does that mean?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.492
You're saying you don't respect me?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.244
We can't be friends because of a vote?

10:20.328 --> 10:21.621
It is more than a vote.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.457
Yeah. It's a fundamental right
that I exercised.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.500
This kind of changes
how I feel about you.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.085
If I can't have a political opinion

10:28.169 --> 10:30.087
about the best way
to improve all our lives--

10:30.171 --> 10:31.964
Do you think anybody's life got better?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.257
[Dr. Andrews] That's enough.

10:39.055 --> 10:39.930
Are you okay?

10:41.807 --> 10:43.267
The repairs are almost finished.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.353
We can be done with this
in two or three hours.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.646
We have just enough blood.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.565
That's if we want to.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.374
Mrs. Bardo?

11:07.583 --> 11:08.668
[Carina] What is it?

11:08.751 --> 11:11.253
Uh, we fixed two holes
in your son's ventricles.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.339
We've removed his spleen
and repaired his liver,

11:13.422 --> 11:14.673
but he's still in surgery.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.095
Your son has lost a lot of blood.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.721
We're giving him transfusions,

11:20.805 --> 11:23.933
but the blood loss may have
caused damage to his brain.

11:31.649 --> 11:35.319
If his brain is fine,
then we should push on,

11:35.403 --> 11:37.238
but if his brain isn't fine,

11:38.114 --> 11:41.617
then… continuing the surgery
could kill him.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.414
Unfortunately, we can't accurately assess

11:46.497 --> 11:48.124
for brain function in the O.R.,

11:48.207 --> 11:51.627
so we would have to wake him up
and do a traditional neuro exam.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.797
You need her to decide that?

11:55.339 --> 11:56.841
Why put that on her?

11:56.924 --> 11:59.051
-You guys are the doct--
-Wake him up.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.641
If you wake him up,
I can be there, right?

12:05.724 --> 12:07.184
You can.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.354
But he will be confused and stressed.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.231
His belly will still have to be open--

12:12.314 --> 12:14.942
My husband died
in a car accident two years ago.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.946
I didn't get to say goodbye.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.658
This is not goodbye.
This decision should not be based on--

12:22.741 --> 12:23.951
Please.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.662
Wake him up.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.041
Okay. Come with us.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.675
Why haven't I heard anything?

12:46.265 --> 12:48.893
[Shaun] The brain looks more relaxed now.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.811
[Dr. Lim] There are a lot of clots.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.439
[Dr. Park sighs]

12:57.318 --> 12:58.736
Kellan play soccer?

12:59.153 --> 13:00.154
[Dr. Park] I'm fine.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.865
Two kids shot. We all are.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.784
[knock on window]

13:07.161 --> 13:08.662
You're not supposed to be here.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.498
I know. I am so sorry.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.876
Is the baby okay?
Did you get your test results?

13:13.959 --> 13:15.753
No, but I'm fine. The baby's fine.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.004
How's the boy?

13:17.087 --> 13:19.924
You can't be here,
and we can't tell you.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.843
I'm sitting in a waiting room
with a terrified mother.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.763
Somebody needs to tell her
he's being taken care of.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.313
Mrs. Wilkie?
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy--

13:34.396 --> 13:35.898
Is my son okay?

13:38.484 --> 13:41.862
Okay, we have successfully removed

13:41.946 --> 13:44.907
half of your son's skull
to reduce brain pressure.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.825
We've removed blood clots,
bone chips,

13:46.909 --> 13:48.327
and bullet fragments.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.580
But we are still trying
to find the less accessible

13:51.664 --> 13:54.500
and deeper chunks
of the bullet in his brain.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.296
Can I see him?

14:00.965 --> 14:03.092
Of course not. He's in surgery.

14:08.222 --> 14:12.643
We… just needed
to let you know his status.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.441
I'm sorry.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.070
[breathing heavily]

14:29.034 --> 14:30.452
[Claire] Hey, Mason.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.746
I need you to follow my finger, okay?

14:43.132 --> 14:44.967
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.552
Your little piggies?

14:52.808 --> 14:54.310
You're acing this test, Mason.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.230
Now can you squeeze my fingers?

14:59.189 --> 15:01.066
Just try to make a fist.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.152
Doesn't have to be hard,
just a little squeeze.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.702
Okay, no, that's okay.
Hey, Mason, look at me.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.959
You're gonna be okay, pumpkin.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.045
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.382
Hey.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.598
[shrapnel clangs]

15:35.601 --> 15:38.270
[Shaun] There's an indentation

15:38.354 --> 15:40.439
on a right M3 segment branch artery.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.400
That suggests the presence
of a deeper fragment.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.155
[Dr. Park] Nice catch.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.283
[Dr. Lim] Yes, but I'm not sure
how we get it out.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.925
When was Ethan's birthday?

16:10.302 --> 16:12.721
Um, October.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.309
It was just the three of us.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.354
We have a golden doodle
named Derber.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.608
Ethan wanted to invite
a couple of friends over,

16:24.692 --> 16:26.443
but I said no, it wasn't safe.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.029
[sighs]

16:29.113 --> 16:30.531
He wanted two friends.

16:30.614 --> 16:34.451
He has like 100 of them
and I said no to two.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.959
Feels like all Ethan and I
ever do now is fight.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.381
Children don't need
their parents to be buddies.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.758
They need limits, structure.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.178
You don't have kids, do you?

16:58.308 --> 16:59.810
He'll die hating me.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.856
Taryn, you cannot think like that.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.906
We found the last bullet fragment.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.783
It's deep but stable,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.411
so it is very unlikely
to cause further brain damage,

17:17.494 --> 17:18.537
bleeds, or seizures.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.205
We should leave it where it is.

17:22.791 --> 17:27.254
You want to leave a bullet
in my son's brain?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.881
Removing it comes with a high risk

17:28.964 --> 17:30.632
of lacerating key brain vessels.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.259
[shudders]

17:38.015 --> 17:39.224
You can trust them.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.185
They're the best doctors I've ever known.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.777
Okay.

17:50.819 --> 17:51.820
Leave it in.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.881
Did you get to see Mason?

18:13.634 --> 18:15.260
They're doing more tests.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.264
But I know he'll be fine.

18:21.850 --> 18:22.935
He will.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.192
Does Mason play any sports?

18:30.275 --> 18:31.485
Uh,

18:32.402 --> 18:33.612
basketball.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.657
Team captain.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.868
Likes to be in charge.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.413
So mature for his age.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.668
When my husband died,

18:48.377 --> 18:50.129
it was Mason who kept me going.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.341
Brought me coffee every morning,

18:55.717 --> 18:57.553
opened my curtains,

18:58.554 --> 19:00.055
helped me get out of bed.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.687
I'm a single mom, too.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.817
Helluva day to be one, isn't it?

19:12.317 --> 19:13.318
Mm.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.823
When did you lose your husband?

19:19.366 --> 19:22.536
We divorced two years ago.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.037
But not amicably.

19:24.872 --> 19:25.956
Divorced.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.502
I know it's not the same, but--

19:30.586 --> 19:32.212
I buried my husband.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.049
You lost him in
the worst possible way, yes.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.637
But I doubt you also lost
half of your friends,

19:40.721 --> 19:42.097
your self-respect,

19:42.181 --> 19:45.392
and [sighs] the love of your son.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.854
I doubt you ever had to tell your son

19:48.937 --> 19:50.939
that Daddy was never coming home again.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.065
Look, I didn't mean to--

19:52.149 --> 19:53.650
You figured you know me.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.403
You've experienced pain,

19:57.029 --> 20:00.199
so you understand all the pain
everybody else has ever felt.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.450
I understand pain--

20:01.533 --> 20:03.410
-Shut up.
-Right.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.288
Someone disagrees with you
and you shut them up.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.540
You couldn't let us wave
our little signs in peace?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.042
You had to come shout us down,

20:10.125 --> 20:12.544
and when that didn't work,
you had to shoot us?

20:37.819 --> 20:39.238
-Yes?
-Yes?

20:40.864 --> 20:42.324
You can go first.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.367
Why?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.370
I'm being polite.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.164
It won't make any difference
who hears their news first.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.502
We don't think there is any brain damage.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.421
We're gonna take him back
to the O.R. to finish the repairs.

20:56.505 --> 21:00.384
[whimpers] Wonderful. Thank you so much.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.677
Of course.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.348
We have to leave Ethan's skull off

21:06.431 --> 21:09.351
until his brain swelling has gone down,

21:09.434 --> 21:11.520
which could be
a couple of days from now.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.688
Or months.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.317
We've moved him to intensive care.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.652
You can see him now.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.654
[sighs]

21:37.587 --> 21:38.797
[sighs]

21:38.880 --> 21:42.301
When he was a baby,
I used to love watching him sleep.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.387
It was the only time he wasn't
bouncing off the walls.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.265
The only time I could just look at him.

21:50.225 --> 21:53.395
When he was older,
if he caught me watching him,

21:53.478 --> 21:55.230
he would say that I was weird,

21:55.314 --> 21:56.315
and…

21:57.357 --> 21:59.276
I just told him how beautiful he was.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.695
And that only made me weirder.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.573
But he is

22:05.490 --> 22:06.700
so beautiful.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.873
His eyes moved. They moved.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.750
He's looking at me. That's good, right?

22:14.833 --> 22:15.834
Yes.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.423
No, he's not looking at you.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.133
His eyes are deviating to the right.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.676
What does that…

22:25.260 --> 22:26.511
He's squeezing my hand.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.430
Ethan, honey, Mommy's here.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.766
How hard? Is it getting firmer?

22:30.849 --> 22:31.683
Yeah.

22:32.225 --> 22:35.520
Ativan. Increase propofol,
and we need a C.T. and an E.E.G.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.856
He is having a focal seizure

22:37.939 --> 22:40.525
which is originating
in the left side of the brain,

22:40.609 --> 22:43.653
which wasn't the damaged side,
which is very strange.

22:45.530 --> 22:49.159
The bullet fragment must've migrated.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.869
It was a mistake to leave it in.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.381
He's seizing.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.259
This is exactly
what he said wouldn't happen

23:06.343 --> 23:07.886
if we left the bullet in.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.054
Exactly.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.640
I'm sure he'll figure out
what to do, and--

23:11.723 --> 23:13.016
[footsteps approaching]

23:13.975 --> 23:15.393
Who do you have news for?

23:17.771 --> 23:18.688
Ms. Dilallo?

23:26.696 --> 23:27.697
Good news?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.492
Oh, it's nothing.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.954
It's okay for someone to be happy.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.958
I'm expecting.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.751
And all's good.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.924
I gave birth on Christmas Eve.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.344
All the nurses were singing carols.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.931
Kenny joked that the only thing missing

23:53.014 --> 23:54.516
were the three wise men.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.437
It was hokey and ridiculous.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.108
But it was magical.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.114
Ethan was three weeks premature.

24:11.032 --> 24:13.201
We were having just one last fun weekend,

24:13.285 --> 24:16.413
the two of us,
and I guess Ethan didn't like that idea,

24:16.496 --> 24:22.711
so I gave birth in a motel room
300 miles from my OB.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.131
Left a really good tip for housekeeping.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.935
[Shaun] It's very strange.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.645
I was wrong.

24:41.104 --> 24:44.524
It's… very, very strange.

24:45.775 --> 24:46.818
[monitor beeps]

24:46.902 --> 24:47.777
No, you weren't.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.072
The fragment's still stable in location,

24:51.156 --> 24:53.825
no severe compression on MCA,
no new bleeds.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.328
That just means
we missed something else.

25:00.832 --> 25:01.917
There.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.501
Deep in the left thalamus.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.087
I wasn't wrong.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.757
I wasn't wrong.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.091
You were.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.343
You missed it.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.303
No. No, I wasn't wrong.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.305
I would've noticed another fragment.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.183
There.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.393
There was nothing there
eight hours ago.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.147
Okay, so,

25:25.398 --> 25:29.194
it's just new to this location,

25:29.277 --> 25:31.112
which means it's moving.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.490
And based on its trajectory,

25:33.573 --> 25:35.033
it's gonna cause a lot more damage.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.746
It's much deeper than the other.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.333
So we can't get to it.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.178
We can't go through the water drainage
system of the brain

25:55.262 --> 25:57.973
as we'd have to puncture
the ventricular wall at the thalamus,

25:58.056 --> 26:00.517
and we can't follow the injury
pathway using MRI guidance

26:00.600 --> 26:02.852
because the metal
in the bullet rules out the MRI.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.896
-And we can't--
-Shaun, Shaun, just--

26:04.980 --> 26:07.399
You are a neurosurgeon, okay?

26:07.482 --> 26:09.109
You will know what I have missed.

26:13.321 --> 26:14.781
You don't think you missed anything?

26:16.741 --> 26:17.742
No.

26:18.201 --> 26:19.411
Then you didn't.

26:24.374 --> 26:25.792
Okay, then…

26:28.295 --> 26:30.714
Ethan is probably going to die.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.719
[breathing shakily]

26:39.055 --> 26:40.056
Okay.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.355
[sighs]

26:50.608 --> 26:52.444
This one's different, huh?

26:53.069 --> 26:54.362
Because he is a child?

26:54.446 --> 26:56.865
Yeah, yeah, because he's a child.

26:56.948 --> 26:57.949
No.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.036
I've lost children before.

27:04.205 --> 27:07.042
Shaun, every parent has one job,

27:07.375 --> 27:10.211
and that's to keep their kid alive,

27:10.295 --> 27:13.256
to keep them
from all the horrors in the world.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.467
And maybe

27:17.385 --> 27:19.387
because you can't protect Ethan,

27:20.013 --> 27:21.097
you think…

27:22.140 --> 27:24.768
That's not rational.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.686
No, it's-- [chuckles]

27:26.770 --> 27:31.191
