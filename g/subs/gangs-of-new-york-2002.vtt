WEBVTT

00:53.240 --> 00:55.368
No, son. Never.

00:56.327 --> 00:58.996
The blood stays on the blade.

01:01.749 --> 01:04.168
One day you'll understand.

01:13.094 --> 01:15.471
Some of it I half remember.

01:16.013 --> 01:18.015
And the rest...

01:18.599 --> 01:21.352
The rest I took from dreams.

01:24.939 --> 01:28.359
St. Michael, the archangel,
defend us in battle.

01:28.526 --> 01:33.114
Be our protector against the snares...

01:33.614 --> 01:36.867
and the wickedness of the devil.

01:37.034 --> 01:38.869
Now, son, who's that?

01:39.036 --> 01:40.788
- St. Michael.
- Who is it?

01:40.955 --> 01:42.873
- St. Michael!
- And what did he do?

01:43.040 --> 01:45.835
He cast Satan out of paradise.

01:46.293 --> 01:48.170
Good boy.

02:58.449 --> 03:01.327
May God put the steel of the
Holy Spirit in your spine...

03:01.494 --> 03:04.372
and the love of the Blessed
Virgin in your heart.

03:30.523 --> 03:33.859
- Hey, boyo!
- Johnny.

03:34.026 --> 03:36.946
- What's the battle?
- Natives against the 'Dead Rabbits'.

03:37.113 --> 03:40.783
- Which are you?
- What do you think? 'Dead Rabbits'.

04:20.906 --> 04:23.284
Well, well, Monk.

04:23.534 --> 04:25.536
Are you with us or not?

04:25.703 --> 04:28.914
For the last time, Vallon,
I'm with you if the money is right.

04:29.915 --> 04:32.877
I'll give you 10 per notch.

04:33.085 --> 04:36.714
- Ten?
- You have my word.

04:40.926 --> 04:44.722
- Ten per notch?
- Per new notch.

04:48.434 --> 04:50.269
Then I'm your man.

06:39.128 --> 06:41.964
Is this it, Priest?
The pope's new army?

06:42.131 --> 06:45.509
A few crusty bitches
and a handful of ragtags?

06:45.676 --> 06:49.221
Now, now, Bill, you swore this was
a battle between warriors...

06:49.388 --> 06:51.724
not a bunch of Miss Nancys.

06:51.891 --> 06:54.727
So warriors is what I brought.

06:57.647 --> 06:59.065
The 'O'Connell Guard'.

06:59.231 --> 07:00.733
The 'Plug Uglies'.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.361
The 'Shirt Tails'.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.909
The 'Chichesters'.

07:10.076 --> 07:12.870
The 'Forty Thieves'.

07:29.053 --> 07:31.722
On my challenge...

07:31.931 --> 07:37.687
by the ancient laws of combat, we
have met at this chosen ground...

07:37.853 --> 07:40.272
to settle, for good and all...

07:40.439 --> 07:44.402
who holds sway over the Five Points:

07:44.735 --> 07:50.449
Us Natives, born right-wise
to this fine land...

07:50.616 --> 07:53.452
or the foreign hordes defiling it.

07:57.999 --> 08:03.170
By the ancient laws of combat, I accept
the challenge of the so-called Natives.

08:03.337 --> 08:05.756
You plague our people at every turn.

08:05.923 --> 08:08.801
But from this day out,
you shall plague us no more.

08:08.968 --> 08:12.763
For let it be known that the hand that
tries to strike us from this land...

08:12.930 --> 08:14.640
shall be swiftly cut down.

08:16.809 --> 08:20.271
Then may the Christian Lord
guide my hand...

08:20.438 --> 08:22.690
against your Roman popery!

08:22.857 --> 08:25.651
Prepare to receive the true Lord!

10:28.691 --> 10:30.609
Priest!

11:18.658 --> 11:21.077
Look to me.

11:22.411 --> 11:25.498
Who is this under my knife?

11:33.506 --> 11:36.008
Father, get up. Get up!

11:36.175 --> 11:39.762
Where are you? Where are you?

11:41.097 --> 11:42.640
Oh, my son.

11:45.935 --> 11:49.605
Don't never look away.

11:56.779 --> 11:59.448
Soon be over, Priest.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.452
Finish it.

12:21.470 --> 12:24.390
You may need this across the river.

12:33.316 --> 12:36.736
Ears and noses will be
the trophies of the day.

12:37.570 --> 12:41.407
But no hand shall touch him!

12:43.492 --> 12:46.329
No hand shall touch him!

12:48.372 --> 12:51.000
He'll cross over whole...

12:52.001 --> 12:53.711
in honor.

12:53.878 --> 12:56.589
Not before I get what's owed.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.222
No!

13:06.265 --> 13:10.770
It's fair. A touch indelicate,
but fair.

13:15.399 --> 13:17.401
My sympathies.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.945
What will we do with the boy?

13:20.404 --> 13:22.573
Look at me.

13:28.245 --> 13:29.914
Give him to the law.

13:30.081 --> 13:32.792
See he gets a good education.

13:33.459 --> 13:36.420
Okay, boy, say goodbye to your father.

13:43.469 --> 13:45.680
- Get him!
- Get him!

13:46.597 --> 13:48.099
Don't let him get away.

13:48.265 --> 13:50.768
Hurry, come in here!

13:52.937 --> 13:54.563
He's going downstairs.

14:10.955 --> 14:12.206
Come here, boy.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.292
- You're going to Hellgate, son.
- There he is. Get him.

14:15.459 --> 14:18.462
- Priest Vallon died a noble death...
- Let go of me!

14:18.629 --> 14:24.051
...but his 'Dead Rabbits'
is done and outlawed!

14:25.803 --> 14:30.891
Let no one even speak their name
from this time on.

15:15.561 --> 15:21.067
In this place, you have grown
from a boy into a man.

15:21.902 --> 15:25.614
Put to death the earthly things
in you: Immorality, impurity...

15:26.781 --> 15:29.408
passion, vengeance.

15:29.575 --> 15:32.912
The Lord has forgiven you.

15:33.079 --> 15:36.415
You also must forgive.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.877
You go forth to a country torn
apart by civil strife.

15:42.254 --> 15:44.256
Thank you, Reverend.

15:47.301 --> 15:50.096
Lend your hand to the work
that yet remains...

15:50.262 --> 15:52.473
that this war may end...

15:52.640 --> 15:56.018
and the plague of slavery that
brought this conflagration...

15:56.185 --> 16:01.607
down upon us vanish forever
from the earth.

16:31.421 --> 16:33.340
In the second year of the Civil War...

16:34.006 --> 16:36.592
when the Irish Brigade
marched in the streets...

16:37.059 --> 16:40.104
New York was a city full of tribes...

16:40.271 --> 16:43.649
war chiefs, rich and poor.

16:43.816 --> 16:47.611
- Down with Lincoln!
- Lincoln will make all white men slaves.

16:47.987 --> 16:49.488
It wasn't a city really.

16:50.324 --> 16:54.161
It was more a furnace where a city
someday might be forged.

16:55.328 --> 16:56.996
That's the spirit, boys.

16:57.163 --> 17:01.500
- Go off and die for your blackie friends.
- Down with the abolitionists!

17:01.667 --> 17:04.837
We should've run a better man against
Lincoln when we had the chance.

17:05.003 --> 17:06.839
New York should secede
from the Union!

17:07.006 --> 17:09.759
They trying to say we're
no different than niggers?

17:09.925 --> 17:12.845
You ain't. Good evening, brother.

17:13.387 --> 17:15.263
- Praise the Union.
- The Union forever!

17:15.431 --> 17:18.267
Go back to Africa, nigger!

17:18.726 --> 17:21.686
- Go back to Africa!
- Leave him alone. We're free.

17:21.854 --> 17:24.940
The angriest talk was of the
new Conscription Act...

17:25.107 --> 17:26.942
the first draft in Union history.

17:39.955 --> 17:43.709
Join the Army, lads. Three square meals
a day and good pay in your pocket.

17:43.876 --> 17:47.296
When the Irish came,
the city was in a fever.

17:47.463 --> 17:52.051
Since the time of the great famine,
they'd come streaming off the boats.

17:52.218 --> 17:53.969
And they got a right warm welcome.

17:54.136 --> 17:57.556
- Go back to Ireland, you dumb micks!
- Remember that, you Irish gyps!

17:57.723 --> 17:59.642
Get back on the boat, Paddy!

18:00.309 --> 18:03.521
I only came two hours downriver
from Hellgate.

18:03.688 --> 18:06.065
But they all took me for an immigrant.

18:06.232 --> 18:09.318
Why not? There were a 1,000
different accents in New York.

18:09.485 --> 18:14.198
And to the Natives, you see,
we was all the same.

18:19.370 --> 18:22.873
Welcome to America, son.
Your long, arduous journey is over.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.418
- Go back to your own country!
- Vote Tammany!

18:33.384 --> 18:37.430
New York loved William Tweed
and hated him.

18:37.596 --> 18:41.892
And those of us trying to be thieves,
well, we couldn't help but admire him.

18:42.268 --> 18:45.563
Mr. Cutting, gentlemen,
thank you for coming. It's an honor.

18:45.730 --> 18:47.606
Mr. Tweed.

18:49.692 --> 18:51.944
Sir, please. Excuse me.

18:52.278 --> 18:54.530
- I think you're frightening them.
- So?

18:54.697 --> 18:58.451
Don't mind him.
He used to be an Irishman.

18:59.910 --> 19:01.620
Ah, the Five Points.

19:01.912 --> 19:07.001
Murderers ' Alley. Brickbat Mansion.
The Gates of Hell.

19:07.168 --> 19:13.049
Here in this vile place.
Look upon the face of this poor child.

19:13.215 --> 19:15.843
She lives in squalor...

19:16.010 --> 19:20.389
in this god-forsaken den
of vice and misery behind me.

19:20.848 --> 19:23.267
Every year the reformers came.

19:23.434 --> 19:25.144
Every year the Points got worse...

19:27.480 --> 19:29.315
as if it liked being dirty.

19:30.191 --> 19:33.527
- Where am I going to go?
- The Reverend wants you out of here.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.946
You can't do this!

19:37.698 --> 19:41.160
A glorious resurrection will spring
from the filthy depths...

19:41.327 --> 19:44.789
to which these miserable creatures
have fallen.

19:44.955 --> 19:47.667
In God, they will find their true home.

19:47.833 --> 19:51.462
You may or may not know, Bill,
that every day I go to the waterfront...

19:51.629 --> 19:54.298
with hot soup for the Irish
as they come ashore.

19:54.465 --> 19:56.550
It's part of building a political base.

19:56.717 --> 19:59.637
I've noticed you there.
You may have noticed me.

19:59.804 --> 20:03.057
Indeed I have. Throwing torrents
of pavers and withering abuse...

20:03.224 --> 20:06.811
- on everyone stepping off those boats.
- If only I had the guns...

20:06.978 --> 20:11.816
I'd shoot each and every one of them
before they set foot on American soil.

20:37.258 --> 20:39.760
Mulberry Street...

20:40.511 --> 20:42.263
and Worth.

20:42.430 --> 20:47.184
Cross and Orange and Little Water.

20:47.351 --> 20:50.271
Each of the Five Points is a finger.

20:50.438 --> 20:54.775
When I close my hand,
it becomes a fist.

20:54.942 --> 20:59.030
And any time that I wish,
I can turn it against you.

20:59.196 --> 21:01.449
I know, but we're talking
about different things.

21:01.615 --> 21:05.077
I'm talking about civic duty,
responsibilities we owe to the people.

21:05.244 --> 21:08.122
Schools and hospitals,
sewers and utilities.

21:08.289 --> 21:10.624
Street construction,
repairs and sweeping.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.044
Business licenses, saloon licenses...

21:34.273 --> 21:38.778
St. Michael, the archangel,
defend us in battle.

21:38.944 --> 21:42.782
Be our protector against the snares
and the wickedness of the devil.

21:42.948 --> 21:45.576
Street cars, ferries, rubbish disposal.

21:45.743 --> 21:48.621
There's a power of money
to be made in this city, Bill.

21:48.788 --> 21:52.833
With your help, the people
must be made to understand...

21:53.000 --> 21:57.088
that all these things are best kept
within the Tammany family...

21:57.254 --> 21:59.465
which is why I'm proposing
an alliance...

21:59.632 --> 22:02.051
between our two great organizations.

22:02.218 --> 22:06.555
- You're talking about muscle work.
- That too. Muscle to match our spirit.

22:06.722 --> 22:08.599
You own the crushers.
Get them to do it.

22:08.766 --> 22:10.726
The police? Oh, no. Jesus, no!

22:10.893 --> 22:14.730
The appearance of the law
must be upheld...

22:14.897 --> 22:17.441
especially while it's being broken.

22:28.828 --> 22:32.331
Give me the strength
for what I must do.

22:35.334 --> 22:37.169
Who are you?

22:39.672 --> 22:41.549
- Hey!
- No!

22:41.716 --> 22:44.969
I said, who are you?
What are you doing here?

22:52.518 --> 22:55.438
I just like it down here is all.

22:56.188 --> 22:58.691
See what's in his pockets, Jimmy.

22:58.858 --> 23:02.361
- Look, boys, I really don't want a fight.
- Don't want a fight?

23:02.528 --> 23:05.781
Don't worry, son,
ain't gonna be much a fight.

23:12.955 --> 23:14.874
Don't kill me.

23:22.882 --> 23:24.884
Where'd you get that?

23:25.051 --> 23:27.470
I told you I didn't want a fight!

23:27.636 --> 23:30.348
Why not? Look how good you done.

23:37.730 --> 23:42.485
- You're the Priest's son, aren't you?
- You, get away from me, understand?

23:42.652 --> 23:47.323
You don't remember me, do you?
I's the one tried to help you.

23:49.075 --> 23:52.078
- What?
- I's the one tried to help ye...

23:52.244 --> 23:54.580
when the Natives took you.

23:58.167 --> 24:03.172
- Oh, that was you?
- Yeah. I thought you was killed.

24:05.883 --> 24:07.885
They just locked me up,
you know that?

24:08.052 --> 24:10.054
This long?

24:10.221 --> 24:15.059
Well, I kept trying to escape, you know.
They add on time for that.

24:16.102 --> 24:18.729
So, what are you doing back here?

24:19.397 --> 24:21.440
I guess I missed the place.

24:28.530 --> 24:30.282
Bowery Boys.

24:42.461 --> 24:43.921
Get back here!

24:44.088 --> 24:46.924
The Five Points, Paradise Square.

24:47.091 --> 24:50.136
The streets here are always lively
of an evening.

24:51.137 --> 24:52.847
Who are the gangs around now?

24:53.014 --> 24:54.974
The 'Daybreak Boys'
and the 'Swamp Angels'.

24:55.141 --> 24:57.310
They work the river, looting ships.

24:57.476 --> 25:00.187
The 'Frog Hollows' shanghai sailors
by the Bloody Angle.

25:00.354 --> 25:03.758
The 'Shirt Tails' was rough, but
they've become a bunch of dandies...

25:03.775 --> 25:06.694
loggin' around Murderers' Alley,
looking like Chinamen.

25:07.194 --> 25:09.905
Hell-Cat Maggie, she tried to open
her own grog shop.

25:10.072 --> 25:12.700
She drunk her own liquor
and got throwed on the street.

25:12.867 --> 25:15.411
- Beautiful.
- Now she's on the lay for anything.

25:15.578 --> 25:18.122
The 'Plug Uglies' are from deep
in the old country.

25:18.289 --> 25:20.541
Got their own language
no one understands.

25:20.708 --> 25:24.086
They love to fight the cops.
The 'Night Walkers' of Ragpicker's Row.

25:24.545 --> 25:27.214
They work on their backs
and kill with their hands.

25:27.381 --> 25:31.135
They're so scurvy only the 'Plug Uglies'
talk to them. But who understands them?

25:31.385 --> 25:33.846
The 'Slaughter Housers'
and the 'Broadway Twisters'.

25:34.013 --> 25:37.141
They're a fine bunch of bingo boys.
And the Little 'Forty Thieves'.

25:37.308 --> 25:38.726
I used to run with them...

25:38.893 --> 25:41.812
till they got took over
by Bendrick the Cockroach.

25:41.979 --> 25:43.481
Bendrick carries a germ.

25:43.648 --> 25:46.567
If you try to leave the gang,
he hacks up blood on you.

25:46.734 --> 25:50.154
The 'Lime-Juicers' are nothing but
a bunch of rapacious grab-ups.

25:50.905 --> 25:53.199
The 'True Blue Americans'
say they're a gang...

25:53.366 --> 25:56.118
but all they do is stand on corners
damning England.

25:56.285 --> 25:59.580
If you believe one word
the British say, you're a fool.

25:59.747 --> 26:03.084
Do any of them got the sand
of the 'Dead Rabbits'?

26:06.712 --> 26:08.881
You don't say that name.

26:09.048 --> 26:13.719
That name died with your...
They been outlawed.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.222
In the blockhouse,
the Chinks told me...

26:16.389 --> 26:20.726
that the Natives celebrate their victory
every year. Is that true?

26:21.227 --> 26:23.771
Aye, that they do.
It's quite the affair.

26:23.938 --> 26:26.816
The Butcher himself's got to invite you,
or you don't go.

26:37.410 --> 26:40.329
Look where you're going, Johnny.

26:43.082 --> 26:45.918
You look stunned and poorly, sir.

26:50.256 --> 26:53.426
Quite a pair of conversationists,
aren't you?

26:55.636 --> 26:59.265
Maybe not, but we're deep thinkers.

27:02.601 --> 27:08.774
Well, gentlemen, I leave you
in the grace and favor of the Lord.

27:15.865 --> 27:18.534
Jenny, the finest bludget
in all the Points.

27:18.701 --> 27:21.287
She is a prim-looking stargazer.

27:23.873 --> 27:26.292
But I'd check my pockets
if I was you...

27:26.459 --> 27:29.712
because I do believe she lifted
your timepiece.

27:33.632 --> 27:36.135
Well, I let her take it.

27:36.302 --> 27:39.055
I let her take things all the time.

27:39.555 --> 27:42.099
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

27:46.646 --> 27:49.065
We always liked a good fire
in the Points.

27:49.816 --> 27:55.488
You could pick up a little swag. And
if the cops came, you really got a show.

27:56.155 --> 27:59.575
The Municipal Police fought
the Metropolitan Police.

27:59.742 --> 28:02.495
The Metropolitan Police,
they fought the street gangs.

28:02.662 --> 28:05.081
Hurry up, men,
before the Black Joke get there!

28:05.247 --> 28:09.001
There were 37 amateur fire brigades,
and they all fought each other.

28:09.251 --> 28:15.091
The Black Joke are on their way, Tweed,
and they'll beat the shite out of you.

28:17.426 --> 28:23.349
Okay, boys, get the hose out!

28:28.521 --> 28:31.107
It's the Black Joke!

28:31.273 --> 28:33.693
Go get them, boys!

28:34.443 --> 28:36.821
Give those Bowery Boys hell!

28:36.988 --> 28:40.516
- Quick, before there's nothing left.
- Go back to the Bowery, you bums!

28:40.533 --> 28:43.369
Stop them. For God's sake,
they're taking everything!

28:43.786 --> 28:46.539
In your next time of trouble,
call on Tammany first.

28:46.706 --> 28:50.042
But it's not too late.
You can still save my house.

28:50.710 --> 28:52.378
Let's go.

28:53.129 --> 28:56.048
I thought you said you was hungry.

28:59.718 --> 29:03.264
Grab what you can, Johnny.
Let's get out of here.

29:03.681 --> 29:06.559
May I point out that this building
is burning to ashes?

29:06.726 --> 29:11.063
May I point out this area is the province
of my own Americus fire Brigade...

29:11.230 --> 29:14.692
and that you lot belong
only in the Bowery?

29:15.860 --> 29:18.904
May I point out that you're
outmanned, outmaneuvered...

29:19.071 --> 29:21.198
and, in a moment, outfought?

29:21.365 --> 29:23.200
Am I?

29:29.040 --> 29:32.209
There's the Black Joke!
Let's take them on the cobbles.

29:32.376 --> 29:36.756
Go spill some claret, boys.
Go on, Shorty, have a nice muss.

29:36.922 --> 29:39.592
Clear the way for Bill the Butcher.

29:39.759 --> 29:41.927
Okay, boys, to work.

29:43.054 --> 29:46.766
What's the point? The fire's near burned
anything of value inside.

29:46.932 --> 29:50.227
Boys, forget that one.
Next building over.

29:50.394 --> 29:53.230
Mustn't let it spread.
Take what you want from that one.

29:53.397 --> 29:54.440
What are you doing?

29:54.607 --> 29:57.401
There's nothing wrong with this one.
This is my house.

30:01.238 --> 30:02.698
- Johnny!
- Help!

30:02.865 --> 30:05.368
- Johnny!
- Help!

30:06.786 --> 30:09.580
Help! Help!

30:13.542 --> 30:15.336
Help!

30:19.298 --> 30:21.467
Come on. Come on, Johnny, get up.

30:21.926 --> 30:23.844
Leave that!

30:31.143 --> 30:32.561
You two, out of the way!

30:49.954 --> 30:52.164
His name's Amsterdam.

30:54.667 --> 30:57.670
- How's the beak?
- Ain't so bad.

30:57.837 --> 31:01.924
You. You got anything,
you give it up or you get out.

31:13.144 --> 31:15.021
Is that it?

31:15.396 --> 31:17.398
That's it.

31:18.858 --> 31:22.194
Right. Here's the rake.
Everything comes here. We fence it.

31:22.361 --> 31:25.823
Johnny takes our tribute to the Natives,
and we chop up the winnings...

31:25.990 --> 31:29.493
each to his equal portion,
amongst the gang.

31:29.660 --> 31:33.164
Does that meet
with your approval, Hellgate?

31:33.331 --> 31:34.957
My approval?

31:35.124 --> 31:38.002
What's the matter, Jack Sprat?
Can't think for yourself?

31:39.712 --> 31:42.673
- I'll slit your fucking throat!
- Hey, come on!

31:42.840 --> 31:44.050
Hey!

31:47.553 --> 31:51.557
You boys will settle with me
before settling with each other.

31:54.977 --> 31:57.730
I come for my due and proper.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.834
Well, this ain't a bad haul.

32:19.335 --> 32:22.880
When folks start in to saying to where
the country is going to hell...

32:23.047 --> 32:26.008
I always tell them,
"You just look at all the hard work...

32:26.175 --> 32:29.595
our fine young lads is doing
down in the Five Points."

32:29.762 --> 32:33.808
Oh, yeah. Now this is just
the thing for Mrs. Mulraney.

32:33.975 --> 32:36.310
All right there, Happy Jack,
leave us something...

32:36.477 --> 32:38.854
to quarter to Bill the Butcher, eh?

32:39.021 --> 32:40.606
Would you?

32:52.159 --> 32:54.787
Not my favorite tune.

33:01.961 --> 33:04.213
Thank you, boys.

33:04.755 --> 33:07.758
You keep out of trouble now.

33:25.818 --> 33:29.947
Every year the Natives celebrated
the killing of my father all over again...

33:31.574 --> 33:36.662
at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda
in Mott Street.

33:36.829 --> 33:40.499
The Chinks hated the Natives
worse than we did.

33:43.336 --> 33:47.673
The drum rolls, and the Butcher
drinks a glass of fire.

33:51.802 --> 33:54.221
When you kill a king...

33:54.764 --> 33:57.725
you don't stab him in the dark.

33:59.143 --> 34:04.398
You kill him where the whole court
can watch him die.

34:08.319 --> 34:10.862
Hey, you got any timber?

35:00.830 --> 35:04.667
- Hey, Maggie. Right ear or left ear?
- Give us a drink, you idiot.

35:04.834 --> 35:06.460
Help yourself.

35:06.627 --> 35:08.504
- Final bets!
- To health.

35:08.671 --> 35:11.757
Place your bets.
Betting closes in two minutes.

35:11.924 --> 35:13.217
Place your bets.

35:13.384 --> 35:17.555
Gentlemen, the match
is due to commence.

35:17.722 --> 35:21.267
The count to beat is 25 rodents
in three minutes.

35:21.434 --> 35:23.728
Towser against the vermin.

35:23.894 --> 35:25.604
- Are the enumerators satisfied?
- Fifty!

35:25.771 --> 35:27.898
- Yes!
- Let them go!

35:41.746 --> 35:44.874
- Where you going, boy?
- I'm here to pay tribute to Bill.

35:45.041 --> 35:47.460
Are you now? Give it to me.
I'll give it to him.

35:47.626 --> 35:50.421
No, thanks. I'll give it to him myself.

35:52.048 --> 35:54.550
What do you want to keep,
the money or your teeth?

35:54.717 --> 35:56.427
John.

35:57.303 --> 35:58.971
Welcome.

36:06.812 --> 36:09.482
From me and me lads, sir.

36:16.113 --> 36:19.408
Mate of yours? Where's he from?

36:20.034 --> 36:22.328
Oh, he's not from here, sir.

36:24.997 --> 36:26.707
You.

36:44.016 --> 36:46.268
That's close enough.

36:57.279 --> 37:01.867
Your friend can't look me in the eye.
That's not an admirable characteristic.

37:02.034 --> 37:05.955
No one can look you in the eye, Bill.
Not when you're playing cards.

37:24.557 --> 37:28.227
This is whist. It's a gentleman's game.
Make a gentleman's bet.

37:28.602 --> 37:32.857
- I'm betting large, Bill.
- That ain't large.

37:41.324 --> 37:44.493
Please, don't make that noise again,
Harvey.

37:46.912 --> 37:50.333
I like a man who's willing
to burn for his swag.

37:53.711 --> 37:56.380
How do you fare on water?
Come closer.

37:56.547 --> 37:59.884
Close, John.
I ain't gonna bite. Close.

38:03.179 --> 38:07.266
There's a Portuguese ship lying low
in the harbor, quarantined three weeks.

38:07.433 --> 38:09.602
Get there before
the 'Daybreak Boys' strip her...

38:09.769 --> 38:11.437
maybe you and me will talk more.

38:11.604 --> 38:14.148
- Consider it done, sir.
- Good boy.

38:15.274 --> 38:18.944
And you, whatever your name is...
What is your name?

38:22.615 --> 38:28.996
- Amsterdam, sir.
- Amsterdam. I'm New York.

38:29.205 --> 38:31.749
Don't you never come in here
empty-handed again.

38:31.916 --> 38:35.294
You gotta pay for the pleasure
of my company.

38:35.461 --> 38:37.380
Take him for a boat ride, John.

38:37.546 --> 38:40.675
Who knows, but he might
save your life again.

38:44.303 --> 38:47.098
The 'Daybreak Boys' catch us,
they'll slit our throats.

38:47.264 --> 38:49.976
I'll do it myself in a minute
if you don't keep quiet.

38:50.142 --> 38:53.312
I never liked the harbor after dark.

38:53.479 --> 38:56.857
And now each night they brung ashore
the bodies of the soldiers.

38:57.024 --> 38:58.943
Many mothers have not
even the solace...

38:59.110 --> 39:01.487
of knowing where
their sons have fallen.

39:01.654 --> 39:04.365
I lost my own eldest at Antietam.

39:04.532 --> 39:07.159
His mother and I were unable
to recover his remains.

39:07.326 --> 39:10.037
- It was a mournful sight.
- The war can't last forever.

39:10.204 --> 39:12.915
But we had business of our own.

39:21.632 --> 39:26.637
The 'Daybreak Boys' have been here,
and there's nothing left. Let's go back.

39:30.266 --> 39:32.810
What the hell?

39:39.650 --> 39:41.777
Jimmy, get down!

39:43.988 --> 39:47.867
Jesus, that'll bring the harbor cops
for sure. Fuck off.

39:55.541 --> 39:57.668
Let's take a look.

40:00.379 --> 40:02.715
Jesus, they killed everybody.

40:02.882 --> 40:05.718
There's nothing here but a bunch
of dead sea-crabs.

40:05.885 --> 40:08.179
Come on, let's go.

40:09.764 --> 40:12.224
- Shove off.
- No, wait for Amsterdam.

40:12.391 --> 40:14.560
Where's Amsterdam?

40:17.021 --> 40:19.565
- No, you damn fool, take him!
- What in the hell for?!

40:19.732 --> 40:21.859
Look in my glims.
I said no less than 15.

40:22.026 --> 40:25.404
- Is this fresh?
- Four hours most.

40:25.738 --> 40:28.324
Much obliged, gents.

40:35.373 --> 40:37.500
What's that word?

40:38.417 --> 40:40.753
- It means body snatchers.
- I didn't ask the meaning.

40:40.920 --> 40:42.254
I asked the word.

40:42.922 --> 40:44.423
Ghoul.

40:45.967 --> 40:49.387
Ghoul? That's a good word.

40:49.553 --> 40:55.893
"Ghoul Gang Slaughters.
A fresh Outrage in the Five Points."

40:56.060 --> 40:58.521
- That's a notice you can be proud of.
- Thank you.

40:58.688 --> 41:02.441
A low thing, to do that to a body.
Low.

41:02.608 --> 41:04.902
Why? They could have left
that ship with nothing.

41:05.069 --> 41:09.281
Instead they made The Police Gazette,
a periodical of note.

41:09.448 --> 41:11.826
A body's supposed to stay
beneath the earth...

41:11.993 --> 41:15.162
wearing a wooden coat
until the Resurrection.

41:15.329 --> 41:18.290
These two are a pair of sons
of Irish bitches, same as you.

41:18.457 --> 41:20.501
It don't seem to bother them none.

41:20.668 --> 41:23.587
But then maybe they don't share
your religious scruples.

41:23.754 --> 41:26.549
Maybe they're just a couple
of 'Fidlam Bens'.

41:32.138 --> 41:36.142
I've been called a lot of things, mister,
but I ain't never been called...

41:36.309 --> 41:39.979
- Fidlam Bens.
- Fidlam Bens. Right.

41:40.146 --> 41:46.527
Well, if I knew what in the hell that
meant, I'd be inclined to take offense.

41:46.694 --> 41:50.948
A 'Fidlam Bens' is a fellow
who steals anything, dead or alive...

41:51.115 --> 41:54.160
because he's too low to work up
a decent lay for himself.

41:54.327 --> 41:56.620
Count that careful, Bill.
Count that careful.

41:56.787 --> 41:59.832
- I'm telling you, that's all there is...
- Now, chiseler...

41:59.999 --> 42:03.544
If you'd said "chiseler", now there's
a word I understand. You know?

42:03.711 --> 42:07.840
- Now, is that what you're calling us?
- I can think of many things to call you.

42:08.007 --> 42:11.302
Right. But I asked
if you was calling us chiselers.

42:11.469 --> 42:14.221
Supposing I am?

42:16.182 --> 42:18.851
Well, then we got business.

42:19.685 --> 42:22.063
That we do.

42:28.861 --> 42:31.822
- A fight! There's a fight!
- Two bucks on McGloin.

42:31.989 --> 42:34.450
- Four bits on the kid.
- Five bits on the kid.

42:34.617 --> 42:37.495
I got two on Amsterdam.

42:45.961 --> 42:49.382
Come on, McGloin, he's just a kid.

42:49.966 --> 42:52.551
Four bits to back Amsterdam.

42:59.225 --> 43:02.144
Watch his left, McGloin. Watch his left.

43:41.684 --> 43:44.895
- All right, that'll do. That'll do.
- Anything to say now, huh?!

43:45.062 --> 43:47.690
That'll do, for chrissake.
Drag him off.

43:47.857 --> 43:51.027
- That's enough, kid.
- You got him. Come on, kid, you won.

43:51.193 --> 43:54.030
McGloin. He's a kid too, McGloin.

43:54.196 --> 43:56.782
You're getting too old for it, McGloin.

44:18.346 --> 44:23.809
McGloin, how would that head look
without the ears and the nose on it?

44:25.061 --> 44:27.480
You'd better leave
that head alone, Bill.

44:27.647 --> 44:31.150
I think I'm gonna trim the ears
and the beak off of that head.

44:32.485 --> 44:34.654
Make a nice pot of soup of that head.

44:34.820 --> 44:37.573
You could find a tastier head
than that, Bill.

44:37.740 --> 44:41.160
I ain't got the stomach for no Irish stew.

44:43.537 --> 44:48.668
The mighty McGloin
almost fish-hooked by a sprat.

44:57.343 --> 45:01.514
On the seventh day, the Lord rested,
but before that he did...

45:01.681 --> 45:07.561
he squatted over the side of England,
and what came out of him was Ireland.

45:07.728 --> 45:11.774
- No offense, son.
- Oh, none taken, sir. I grew up here.

45:11.941 --> 45:16.487
All I ever knew of Ireland was in the
talk of the others at the orphan asylum.

45:16.654 --> 45:21.617
In which part of that excrementitious
isle were your forebears spawned?

45:21.784 --> 45:27.415
I've been told Kerry, but I lost proof
of it in my language at the asylum.

45:27.581 --> 45:30.876
I was raised in a very similar
establishment myself.

45:31.043 --> 45:34.463
Now everything you see belongs to me,
to one degree or another.

45:34.630 --> 45:37.717
The beggars and newsboys
and quick thieves here in Paradise.

45:37.883 --> 45:41.429
The sailor dives and gin mills
and blind tigers on the waterfront.

45:41.595 --> 45:44.557
The anglers and amusers,
the she-hes and the Chinks.

45:44.724 --> 45:46.559
Everybody owes, everybody pays...

45:46.726 --> 45:52.606
because that's how you stand up
against the rising of the tide.

45:52.773 --> 45:56.027
- Is that right, boys?
- Yeah, Bill. That's right.

45:56.193 --> 45:58.362
Enlist. Join up. Serve your country.

45:59.196 --> 46:01.991
Come on in out of the draft, boys.

46:02.158 --> 46:04.410
Volunteer and get your $50 bonus.

46:05.037 --> 46:09.333
We need 30,000 volunteers, and we're
prepared to pay $677 per volunteer.

46:10.750 --> 46:13.085
- Please read this. Thank you.
- Thanks.

46:13.252 --> 46:15.713
Would you like to take
one of these to fill out?

46:15.880 --> 46:19.425
Three square meals a day.
Three square meals a day.

46:19.592 --> 46:22.386
Young man, enlist
and serve your country.

46:22.553 --> 46:24.513
Three square meals a day, gentlemen.

46:24.680 --> 46:27.350
If you're interested,
read this and consider joining.

46:27.516 --> 46:30.353
Everywhere you went
people talked about the draft.

46:30.519 --> 46:33.731
Now, you could buy
your way out for $300...

46:33.898 --> 46:35.983
but who had $300?

46:36.150 --> 46:38.944
For us it might as well
have been 3 million.

46:39.111 --> 46:43.115
The recruiters? They was too scared
of the gangs to come after us.

46:43.282 --> 46:48.120
Besides, we never dreamt the war
would ever touch New York.

46:48.287 --> 46:49.705
Good morning, sir.

46:51.666 --> 46:53.125
You!

46:53.584 --> 46:55.294
Don't you run into me.

46:56.629 --> 46:58.381
Fair enough.

47:03.177 --> 47:05.304
I said, don't run into me!

47:05.471 --> 47:07.640
Well, sorry.

47:13.437 --> 47:16.816
- Everything in place?
- It seems so.

47:16.983 --> 47:19.944
Well, then I leave you
in the grace and favor of the Lord.

47:20.111 --> 47:22.279
- Thank you.
- That's right.

47:29.829 --> 47:33.165
Oh, the dirty mab!

47:36.836 --> 47:38.421
Oh, no.

47:38.587 --> 47:41.048
- I'm sorry.
- Allow me.

47:43.342 --> 47:46.846
- Thank you kindly, sir.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

47:47.596 --> 47:49.807
I hope you won't think
me rude if I speak.

47:49.974 --> 47:52.184
I wouldn't want to appear forward.

47:52.351 --> 47:57.189
Well, sir, that depends
on what you say.

48:05.114 --> 48:09.535
Would you call me reckless if I said
you were the prettiest girl in New York?

48:09.702 --> 48:12.413
Only New York?

48:14.248 --> 48:15.499
This is my stop.

48:17.626 --> 48:20.630
May I walk with you a little then?

48:20.796 --> 48:23.549
That, sir, would be too bold.

48:41.233 --> 48:42.318
Good morning.

48:50.743 --> 48:54.246
For every lay we had a different name.

48:54.413 --> 48:56.707
An "angler" put a hook
on the end of a stick...

48:56.874 --> 49:00.002
to drop behind
store windows and doors.

49:00.169 --> 49:03.756
An "autumn diver"
picked your pocket in church.

49:03.923 --> 49:06.467
A "badger" gets a fellow
into bed with a girl...

49:06.634 --> 49:09.595
then robs his pockets
while they're on the go.

49:10.096 --> 49:13.849
Jenny was a "bludget",
a girl pickpocket...

49:14.016 --> 49:17.937
and a "turtledove".

49:19.605 --> 49:22.817
A turtledove goes uptown
dressed like a housemaid...

49:22.984 --> 49:26.737
picks out a fine house
and goes right through the back door.

49:27.154 --> 49:28.447
Robs you blind.

49:30.408 --> 49:33.703
It takes a lot of sand
to be a turtledove.

49:55.808 --> 49:59.770
I'll have my medal back. Oh, Jesus!

50:06.360 --> 50:08.362
Don't do that again.

50:08.529 --> 50:11.365
Listen! I said, don't do that...

50:12.033 --> 50:14.160
Go back to the Points
and leave me to my business...

50:14.327 --> 50:17.288
or I will open your throat,
so help me God.

50:20.624 --> 50:22.585
All right.

50:24.170 --> 50:26.130
Go on then.

50:28.341 --> 50:30.259
I would.

50:31.802 --> 50:33.179
Go on then.

50:55.493 --> 50:58.162
Now give me back my medal.

50:58.537 --> 51:00.790
Make it quick!

51:07.922 --> 51:10.883
I don't know which one's yours.

51:17.473 --> 51:19.850
Suppose I help myself to everything?

51:22.645 --> 51:24.397
Suppose you do.

52:03.561 --> 52:06.355
May I walk with you a little then?

52:14.905 --> 52:17.616
What do you suppose a fellow
could earn here in a day?

52:17.950 --> 52:21.120
- Maybe we could pal in together.
- Oh, I think you're a bit...

52:21.287 --> 52:25.916
rough for this sort of game.
Besides, I work alone.

52:26.083 --> 52:29.003
Alone? Well, what do you quarter
to the Butcher?

52:29.170 --> 52:31.464
- Me? Nothing.
- Nothing?

52:31.631 --> 52:34.133
The Butcher and me
have a special arrangement.

52:41.599 --> 52:45.436
- I don't want to see you again.
- Well, I don't blame you.

52:46.270 --> 52:48.981
Pennies in their pockets
and hope in their eyes...

52:49.148 --> 52:51.233
they peer to the west...

52:51.400 --> 52:55.988
searching the horizon
for a glimpse of land and salvation.

52:57.782 --> 52:59.367
A glimpse of America.

52:59.533 --> 53:02.870
Seeing all this poverty must be
most unsettling, Miss Schermerhorn.

53:03.037 --> 53:06.666
Some days, of course,
the uptown gangs come down to us.

53:07.249 --> 53:10.920
The Schermerhorns was one
of the oldest families in New York.

53:11.087 --> 53:12.672
They didn't run the city...

53:12.838 --> 53:15.257
but they was listened
to carefully by them that did.

53:15.424 --> 53:17.218
Commissioner Brunt
said you wished to view...

53:17.385 --> 53:19.762
the Points in all
its splendor and squalor.

53:19.929 --> 53:22.181
"Spare nothing concerning
the conditions", said he.

53:22.348 --> 53:25.267
Yeah, nothing except
our safety, constable.

53:25.434 --> 53:29.021
I'm sure we can be in no danger
while we're in the constable's company.

53:29.188 --> 53:32.775
Quite so, madam. Witness.

53:39.907 --> 53:43.035
- Shall we continue on?
- What, you dare to leave it there?

53:43.202 --> 53:47.790
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greeley,
since all know it's mine.

53:47.957 --> 53:53.212
- Is that man drunk?
- Dead as Good Friday, miss.

53:57.466 --> 53:59.844
- Good day to you, Mulraney.
- Boys.

54:00.011 --> 54:01.721
- Jack.
- Slum sociable?

54:01.887 --> 54:04.390
Fact-finding. Reforms-studying.

54:04.557 --> 54:07.018
- May I present ...?
- The Schermerhorns of 5th Avenue...

54:07.184 --> 54:09.395
scarcely require
an introduction from you.

54:09.562 --> 54:12.898
Schermerhorn, indeed. Their daughter.
This gentleman, of course...

54:13.065 --> 54:16.319
Horace Greeley, the famous publisher.
A pleasure and an honor.

54:16.736 --> 54:19.530
- Of the Tribune.
- I'm William Cutting.

54:20.906 --> 54:23.242
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?

54:24.744 --> 54:28.914
As of this moment, extremely well,
thank you. How do you do?

54:29.415 --> 54:31.459
Orange blossom. Delicious.

54:31.626 --> 54:33.919
- Mr. Cutting is...
- What a peach.

54:34.086 --> 54:36.088
She could have a fine career
on the stage.

54:36.255 --> 54:38.841
- ...one of Five Points' local...
- A pleasure to meet you.

54:39.008 --> 54:40.551
- ...leaders.
- Mr. Greeley.

54:40.718 --> 54:42.762
- Pleased to meet you.
- The Points welcomes you.

54:42.928 --> 54:45.890
You are welcome to these streets
and will pass in safety.

54:47.016 --> 54:51.771
Oh, I'll see to their safety.
Thank you, Bill. There we are.

54:51.937 --> 54:55.358
Good day, lads.
Criminal's braggadocio, you see.

54:55.524 --> 54:59.779
- He knows who I am.
- You're well-known in these parts.

55:00.112 --> 55:03.366
I must say that I find
that strangely flattering.

55:03.532 --> 55:06.243
- I never did like crushers.
- Well, draw it mild, son.

55:06.410 --> 55:10.956
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs
without I tell him he may do so.

55:23.511 --> 55:27.473
Do you think my watch
would be safe up on that lamppost, Bill?

55:28.808 --> 55:31.227
Why don't you hang it up there and see?

55:34.063 --> 55:35.231
Someday.

55:37.066 --> 55:38.567
Someday is right.

55:40.319 --> 55:42.405
This a new lad?

55:42.863 --> 55:48.369
Just another bastard son of Erin
I folded in the warmth of my embrace.

55:51.247 --> 55:53.874
- Hey!
- I just want to see your face, son.

55:54.041 --> 55:56.210
No harm intended.

56:19.317 --> 56:22.445
You get to know a lot butchering meat.

56:23.738 --> 56:26.282
We're made up of the same things:
Flesh and blood...

56:26.449 --> 56:29.744
tissue, organs.

56:29.910 --> 56:32.621
I love to work with pigs.

56:32.788 --> 56:38.085
The nearest thing in nature to the flesh
of a man is the flesh of a pig.

56:38.252 --> 56:40.421
- Pig, huh?
- That's right.

56:40.588 --> 56:43.132
This is for you, mother.

56:45.635 --> 56:46.969
There you go.

56:47.136 --> 56:50.181
- God bless you, Mr. Cutting.
- God bless you.

56:50.348 --> 56:54.810
- She ain't really my mother.
- I knew that, Bill.

56:58.898 --> 57:01.233
This is the liver.

57:01.734 --> 57:03.527
The kidneys.

57:03.694 --> 57:05.529
The heart.

57:05.696 --> 57:09.075
This is a wound.
The stomach will bleed and bleed.

57:09.241 --> 57:12.578
This is a kill. This is a kill.

57:13.412 --> 57:16.832
The main artery. This is a kill.

57:18.209 --> 57:20.169
You try.

57:23.214 --> 57:24.674
Go ahead.

57:50.491 --> 57:52.994
The lung. Good.
Don't foul the blade on the rib.

57:53.160 --> 57:55.329
Very good. Main artery.

57:55.496 --> 57:58.291
Bleed him slow.
Let him think about it for a while.

57:58.457 --> 58:01.294
Slow death. Good.

58:02.712 --> 58:06.048
You'll each bill the city $5,000
a month for supplies and services...

58:06.215 --> 58:08.009
of which you'll receive 10%.

58:08.175 --> 58:12.013
Bill! Mr. Killoran will work out
the details. Thank you, gentlemen.

58:12.179 --> 58:15.224
That's how we do things
around Tammany, gentlemen.

58:15.391 --> 58:17.310
Who's this then?

58:18.311 --> 58:20.229
Thank you, boys.

58:20.396 --> 58:22.481
Good day, sir.

58:34.076 --> 58:36.620
You got something on your mind?

58:39.373 --> 58:41.459
Bill's taken quite a liking to you.

58:44.170 --> 58:47.965
Now, if you're up to something, Bene.

58:48.132 --> 58:50.343
Only I don't want no part in it.

58:55.014 --> 58:58.517
I was in Hellgate for 16 years.

58:58.893 --> 59:01.270
I'm just trying to make my way is all.

59:01.437 --> 59:03.648
Just like you.

59:04.690 --> 59:06.859
Unless, of course,
you got a better notion?

59:08.361 --> 59:09.487
No.

59:10.446 --> 59:14.533
Bill, I can't get a day's work done
for all the good citizens...

59:14.700 --> 59:18.204
coming in here to harass me
about crime in the Points.

59:18.371 --> 59:20.831
Some even go so far
as to accuse Tammany...

59:20.998 --> 59:24.752
of connivance in this so-called
rampant criminality.

59:24.919 --> 59:28.047
What am I to do? I can't have this.
Something has to be done.

59:28.214 --> 59:30.591
- What do you have in mind?
- I don't know.

59:30.758 --> 59:33.052
I think maybe we should
hang someone.

59:34.303 --> 59:36.430
- Who?
- No one important, necessarily.

59:36.597 --> 59:41.185
Average men will do.
Back-alley amusers with no affiliations.

59:41.352 --> 59:45.064
- How many?
- Three or four.

59:45.398 --> 59:48.943
- Which?
- Four.

59:49.527 --> 59:53.114
You stand here convicted varyingly...

59:53.280 --> 59:56.409
of lewdness, jack-rolling...

59:56.575 --> 01:00:00.329
sneak-thievery,
chloral-hydrating...

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:03.207
sodomy, strangulation...

01:00:03.374 --> 01:00:08.296
and enthusiastic corruption
of the public good.

01:00:09.755 --> 01:00:11.674
- We all go someday, huh?
- Chin up.

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:14.051
Handsome bunch of gallows fruit.
There's my old friend.

01:00:14.218 --> 01:00:17.179
- How are you feeling, Arthur?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:20.391
Say hello to Amsterdam. Nearly
fish-hooked McGloin the other day.

01:00:20.558 --> 01:00:21.726
- How do you do?
- Nearly.

01:00:21.892 --> 01:00:23.602
See you dressed for the occasion.

01:00:23.769 --> 01:00:25.938
You know me,
always like to look me best.

01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:27.606
That's the spirit.

01:00:29.108 --> 01:00:32.028
Nice locket.
I'll give you a dollar for it.

01:00:32.194 --> 01:00:33.863
It's me mother's.

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.448
Dollar and a half?

01:00:36.407 --> 01:00:37.742
Done.

01:00:41.287 --> 01:00:42.788
We'll miss you, Arthur.

01:00:42.955 --> 01:00:45.124
- See you in the hot country, Seamus.
- Hot corn!

01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:48.461
Ears of early white corn!
Hot corn!

01:00:52.632 --> 01:00:54.634
Is my son present here?

01:00:56.385 --> 01:00:57.970
Where's my little fella?

01:01:00.139 --> 01:01:01.932
Look at your dad.

01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:04.143
Farewell, dear boy.

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:10.441
I never struck a foul blow,
nor turned a card.

01:01:11.984 --> 01:01:15.488
May God greet me as a friend.

01:01:39.512 --> 01:01:43.015
â™ª And grace my fears relieved â™ª

01:01:43.182 --> 01:01:47.186
â™ª How precious
Did that grace appear â™ª

01:01:47.353 --> 01:01:50.189
That night,
the reformers held a dance.

01:01:50.356 --> 01:01:52.858
That was the Five Points, all right.

01:01:53.025 --> 01:01:56.320
Hangings of a morning,
dancings of an evening.

01:01:56.487 --> 01:01:58.406
Sure meself, but...

01:01:58.572 --> 01:02:01.409
it's not a matter of words.
I can tell by the way she smiles at me.

01:02:01.575 --> 01:02:03.536
- She smiles at a lot of people.
- Sir.

01:02:03.703 --> 01:02:04.996
You don't know her.

01:02:05.162 --> 01:02:08.708
A penny of gratitude
for a fighting Irishman, young sir.

01:02:11.919 --> 01:02:15.298
- You from Kerry?
- I am, sir. I am.

01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:18.884
- It ain't much.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:02:19.051 --> 01:02:21.637
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are delighted to see...

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:25.266
so many young faces
at our first annual Mission dance.

01:02:25.433 --> 01:02:27.310
This'll be a real ballum rancum, eh?

01:02:27.476 --> 01:02:30.521
The Mission welcomes Christians
of every stamp...

01:02:30.688 --> 01:02:34.275
and we are particularly happy
to greet our Roman Catholic friends...

01:02:34.442 --> 01:02:36.402
who join us here tonight.

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:40.448
- Ladies! Come with me. Come with me.
- Shall we dance?

01:02:40.614 --> 01:02:43.451
We're going to start the dancing
in just a moment.

01:02:43.617 --> 01:02:44.660
No.

01:02:45.411 --> 01:02:49.248
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Good evening, Your Holiness.

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.543
Good evening, Reverend.

01:02:52.877 --> 01:02:55.796
Looks as though
you should have shaved closer.

01:02:59.592 --> 01:03:02.928
Good evening, Reverend.
I do beg your pardon.

01:03:07.266 --> 01:03:09.101
Miss ...?

01:03:12.938 --> 01:03:16.192
- Everdeane.
- Miss Everdeane.

01:03:28.329 --> 01:03:33.292
Now, gentlemen, over here,
if you don't mind. Thank you.

01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:36.295
Open it. Hold it up.

01:03:38.506 --> 01:03:40.466
Into the mirror.

01:04:33.185 --> 01:04:34.645
That one.

01:04:36.314 --> 01:04:39.650
Our queen has chosen.

01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.754
Sir...

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.381
- your lady.
- Right.

01:05:02.548 --> 01:05:05.468
Regular services are held
at the church at 6 and 8.

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:06.719
Go to hell.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:18.314
- What do you think you're doing?
- Dancing.

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:21.734
- I said, why'd you pick me?
- That's none of your business.

01:05:21.901 --> 01:05:23.778
Would you mind telling me?

01:05:24.403 --> 01:05:25.905
I'm sorry.

01:05:26.864 --> 01:05:28.949
Goddamn it!

01:05:29.533 --> 01:05:33.245
I'm sorry.
I'm not much of a dancer.

01:05:33.412 --> 01:05:35.247
Just try to keep calm.

01:05:35.414 --> 01:05:39.669
- I never been to a stepping-ken before.
- It's best not to look down.

01:05:41.796 --> 01:05:44.465
You can hold me tighter if you like.

01:05:51.973 --> 01:05:53.933
- All right?
- Aye.

01:05:55.768 --> 01:05:58.604
So why didn't you dance with Johnny?

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.565
Because...

01:06:04.151 --> 01:06:06.320
I didn't want him.

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.881
I'm not wanting this.

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:15.139
- Wait.
- What?

01:07:15.306 --> 01:07:16.849
Wait.

01:07:17.725 --> 01:07:18.934
How does this open?

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:23.105
It takes too long to lace back up.
We'll be here all night.

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:37.453
Sure, all right, I'll take it off.

01:07:58.933 --> 01:08:01.769
There was a baby.
They cut it out.

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.984
I'm sorry.

01:08:09.068 --> 01:08:11.112
Oh, it's fine.

01:08:14.907 --> 01:08:17.368
Have you got any scars?

01:08:18.868 --> 01:08:20.662
One or two.

01:09:18.845 --> 01:09:20.805
What's that, then?

01:09:20.973 --> 01:09:22.350
That?

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:24.977
It's a gift from Mr. Cutting.

01:09:29.314 --> 01:09:31.067
A gift?

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.611
A gift.

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.322
Was it your birthday?

01:09:37.657 --> 01:09:39.325
No.

01:09:43.496 --> 01:09:45.872
What'd you give him, then?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.836
The answer to that
has nothing to do with you.

01:09:57.593 --> 01:10:00.137
- Don't tell me you're angry with me.
- No.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.848
I'm through with you.

01:10:06.852 --> 01:10:09.563
Well, you're quicker
than most fellows.

01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:12.024
Generally, they wait till afterwards.

01:10:12.191 --> 01:10:15.194
I ain't interested
in the Butcher's leavings.

01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:37.466
Hey! Bill says
keep clear of the pikers.

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:40.553
- Fifteen to one, Bug-Eye Moran.
- Amsterdam!

01:10:41.387 --> 01:10:43.723
Everyone was working
for the Butcher.

01:10:43.889 --> 01:10:45.725
We ran his errands,
made his money...

01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:47.893
took a piece and said,
"Thank you, sir."

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.646
- Gentlemen, it's a raid!
- Even Tweed.

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:53.232
- The fight's over.
- Even me.

01:10:53.399 --> 01:10:56.068
- All right, you stupid...
- My father's son.

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:58.696
- What the hell is this?
- Sorry, Bill.

01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:02.700
The city ordinance against boxiana's
a blight, I grant you, but some...

01:11:02.867 --> 01:11:05.870
I'm losing revenue while you speechify.
Collect those bets!

01:11:06.037 --> 01:11:08.080
How do I collect
if no one won the fight?

01:11:08.247 --> 01:11:11.083
This counts as a "no decision".
You got that covered, right?

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:13.169
Didn't anybody pay off the police?

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:16.005
We paid the Municipal Police.
This is Metropolitan.

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:18.215
- You'll repay me every cent.
- Mr. Tweed...

01:11:18.382 --> 01:11:20.593
- Who asked for your opinion?
- Let him speak!

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.094
He don't answer to you.

01:11:22.386 --> 01:11:24.930
The law says there's no boxing
in the city, right?

01:11:25.097 --> 01:11:28.392
- That's right. In the city.
- Well, where does the city end?

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:39.612
The winner, in the 75th round...

01:11:39.779 --> 01:11:44.700
Allow me to acknowledge the man whose
vision and enterprise made possible...

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:47.703
the staging of this noble combat...

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:51.874
in these awe-inspiring
and entirely legal surroundings:

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:55.044
Mr. William Cutting!

01:11:57.546 --> 01:12:01.926
And... And his young associate!

01:12:02.301 --> 01:12:04.011
That's you, boy.

01:12:05.972 --> 01:12:07.807
Come on, get in there.
Come on, son.

01:12:10.518 --> 01:12:13.062
You done very good.
How do you like them apples?

01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:15.064
We done good.
We done all right.

01:12:15.606 --> 01:12:18.275
- While I have your attention...
- It was a good show.

01:12:18.442 --> 01:12:20.820
...may I remind you of the wonders
that await you...

01:12:20.987 --> 01:12:24.949
at my museum located on Broadway!

01:12:25.116 --> 01:12:28.494
P.T. Barnum's Gallery of Wonders!

01:12:30.788 --> 01:12:34.834
- That's my money!
- Get your hands out of me pockets!

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:41.507
It's a funny feeling being took
under the wing of a dragon.

01:12:41.841 --> 01:12:44.260
It's warmer than you think.

01:12:45.136 --> 01:12:48.180
That's the building of our country
right there, Mr. Cutting.

01:12:48.347 --> 01:12:50.224
Americans aborning.

01:12:50.391 --> 01:12:54.061
I don't see no Americans.
I see trespassers.

01:12:54.228 --> 01:12:57.857
Irish harps will do a job for a nickel
what a nigger does for a dime...

01:12:58.024 --> 01:12:59.984
and a white man used to get
a quarter for.

01:13:00.151 --> 01:13:02.528
What have they done?
Name one thing they've contributed.

01:13:02.695 --> 01:13:05.114
- Votes.
- Votes, you say?

01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:08.367
They vote how the archbishop
tells them. And who tells him?

01:13:08.534 --> 01:13:12.788
Their king in the pointy hat
what sits on his throne in Rome.

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:16.000
Bill's got mixed feelings
as regards the Irish.

01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:21.213
Deliver these good and fervent folk
to the polls on a regular basis...

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.885
and there'll be a handsome price
for each vote goes Tammany's way.

01:13:28.346 --> 01:13:32.308
My father gave his life
making this country what it is.

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:37.730
Murdered by the British with all his men
on the 25th of July, anno Domini 1814.

01:13:37.897 --> 01:13:40.691
You think I'm gonna help you
befoul his legacy...

01:13:40.858 --> 01:13:44.487
by giving this country over to them
what's had no hand in fighting for it?

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:48.658
Why? Because they come off a boat,
crawling with lice and begging for soup?

01:13:49.492 --> 01:13:53.579
You're a great one for the fighting,
I know, but you can't fight forever.

01:13:53.746 --> 01:13:56.999
- I can go down doing it.
- And you will.

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:02.505
What did you say?

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:05.841
I said, you're turning your back
on the future.

01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:10.262
Not our future.

01:14:15.643 --> 01:14:19.605
That document makes you a citizen. This
makes you a private in the Union Army.

01:14:19.772 --> 01:14:21.607
Now go fight for your country.

01:14:21.774 --> 01:14:23.484
Next.

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:26.779
Sign here, son.
Or make your mark.

01:14:26.946 --> 01:14:29.281
You're in the Army now.
Three square meals a day.

01:14:29.448 --> 01:14:32.618
Uniforms first, then weapons.

01:14:33.369 --> 01:14:36.247
- I haven't eaten in two days.
- Keep moving, men.

01:14:44.964 --> 01:14:47.591
There's your musket.
Keep it dry on the boat.

01:14:47.758 --> 01:14:50.177
- Same for this cartridge case.
- Where are we going?

01:14:50.344 --> 01:14:52.096
- I heard Tennessee.
- Where's that?

01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:08.654
Do they feed us now, do you think?

01:15:17.997 --> 01:15:22.585
My children! My children!

01:15:22.793 --> 01:15:27.089
We must heal the divisions
between us.

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.341
This war must cease.

01:15:30.135 --> 01:15:33.263
North and South must stand united!

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:42.355
You're a liar! Rubbish!

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:48.694
- What happens at the finish, then?
- Then we have ourselves a rowdy-dow.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:52.615
- Ain't you been to the theater before?
- No.

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:56.869
Mr. Legree, lay down your whip.

01:15:57.036 --> 01:16:00.873
Miss Eliza,
join hands with Mr. Shelby.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:07.463
And, Topsy, dear little Topsy,
cradle Uncle Tom's head.

01:16:08.047 --> 01:16:10.049
Leave the nigger dead!

01:16:20.059 --> 01:16:21.185
Get me down!

01:16:21.352 --> 01:16:24.397
Down with the Union!

01:16:24.563 --> 01:16:26.232
Down with the Union!

01:16:26.399 --> 01:16:28.067
Down with the Union!

01:16:28.234 --> 01:16:30.403
- Down with the Union!
- Down with the Union!

01:16:48.671 --> 01:16:51.090
- For the blood of the Irish!
- Bill, get down!

01:17:00.266 --> 01:17:03.102
Somebody's popped the Butcher!

01:17:13.821 --> 01:17:17.116
Stifle that rat bastard down!

01:17:23.456 --> 01:17:26.125
God, forgive me.

01:17:43.809 --> 01:17:45.436
Whose man are you?

01:17:45.603 --> 01:17:48.147
Speak smart and speak up.

01:17:49.148 --> 01:17:50.608
What's he saying, boy?

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.904
I think he's making his peace
with God.

01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:57.281
The hell with that.
He makes peace with me.

01:17:57.448 --> 01:18:01.077
I'm hearing confession tonight,
you mother-whoring Irish nigger!

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.913
Whose man are you?
We speak English in this country.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.831
Whose man are you?
See this knife?

01:18:05.998 --> 01:18:09.085
I'm gonna teach you to speak English
with this fucking knife!

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.795
Whose man are you?

01:18:10.962 --> 01:18:13.214
Whose man are you?

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:31.691
Well, that didn't tell us very much.

01:18:34.235 --> 01:18:36.404
Fine waistcoat.

01:18:36.904 --> 01:18:40.533
Shame about it.
I don't think it can be mended.

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:44.287
Will I keep it as a souvenir?

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:20.489
Where's Legree? Where's Mopsy?

01:19:20.656 --> 01:19:25.411
Tragedians, let's continue.
Intermission is over!

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.556
Now that was bloody Shakespearean.

01:19:45.723 --> 01:19:49.268
- What?
- Do you know who Shakespeare was?

01:19:49.769 --> 01:19:52.355
He was the fellow who wrote
the King James Bible.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.774
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:57.902
That's because you're a thick,
ignorant, barbarous Irish whelp.

01:19:58.069 --> 01:19:59.862
Just like your father.

01:20:04.158 --> 01:20:05.451
That's it.

01:20:05.618 --> 01:20:10.039
Tear my head off and destruct the world,
just like the rest of the stupid Irish.

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:15.628
- That's why I never ran with your dad.
- Get off me, you crazy bastard!

01:20:18.464 --> 01:20:22.134
It means, if you're not strong,
you'd better be smart.

01:20:22.301 --> 01:20:25.096
I don't know if you're being
too clever or too dumb.

01:20:25.262 --> 01:20:27.390
Whichever it is,
just remember this much.

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:32.812
For all his faults, your father
was a man who loved his people.

01:20:38.985 --> 01:20:41.737
Amsterdam! Amsterdam!

01:20:41.904 --> 01:20:44.573
New York is calling you.

01:20:56.085 --> 01:21:00.256
Look at that.
What in Christ's name is that?

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:06.387
Rhythms of the Dark Continent thrown
into the kettle with an Irish shindig.

01:21:06.554 --> 01:21:11.475
Stir it around a few times, pull it out,
it's a fine American mess.

01:21:11.851 --> 01:21:14.353
A jig doing a jig.

01:21:15.396 --> 01:21:17.356
A little keepsake.

01:21:20.651 --> 01:21:23.029
- Good on you, sir.
- Come upstairs with me, Bill.

01:21:24.989 --> 01:21:27.575
Have I ever had you before?

01:21:29.035 --> 01:21:31.537
So you don't call me
by my Christian name.

01:21:32.997 --> 01:21:35.207
Bill! Thank God you're all right.

01:21:35.374 --> 01:21:37.585
I heard the news
and came as quick as I could.

01:21:37.752 --> 01:21:39.920
You're as timely as the Angel of Death.

01:21:40.087 --> 01:21:44.717
Bill, you're not suggesting that I would
stoop to what you're suggesting?

01:21:44.884 --> 01:21:48.554
Stop slabbering. If I thought it was you,
you'd be in a wooden coat.

01:21:48.721 --> 01:21:52.058
The hole in my shoulder hurts,
so have a drink and shut up.

01:21:52.224 --> 01:21:54.560
Or shut up and get out.

01:21:54.935 --> 01:21:56.479
I believe I'll have a drink.

01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:58.731
Careful, Tweedy,
the mort's frenchified.

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:03.402
No, no, I'm clean.
Come on, let's go to the bar.

01:22:16.248 --> 01:22:18.167
- Jenny.
- Bill.

01:22:42.441 --> 01:22:44.527
It's gotta be tight.

01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:46.779
She loves to make me cry.

01:22:47.655 --> 01:22:49.115
You can take it.

01:22:58.249 --> 01:23:00.293
There's my boy.

01:23:06.299 --> 01:23:07.883
It's all right.

01:23:13.556 --> 01:23:15.558
To the Butcher.

01:23:20.021 --> 01:23:22.273
We're all much obliged.

01:23:23.858 --> 01:23:25.151
Forever.

01:23:25.318 --> 01:23:28.154
- Bill the Butcher.
- To the Butcher.

01:23:37.371 --> 01:23:39.415
Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?

01:23:42.668 --> 01:23:43.836
Go on. Go.

01:24:01.395 --> 01:24:04.482
Is there anyone in the Five Points
you haven't fucked?

01:24:04.649 --> 01:24:06.108
You!

01:24:16.577 --> 01:24:18.663
Calm down!

01:24:29.882 --> 01:24:32.009
Try it and I'll bite you!

01:24:32.176 --> 01:24:35.721
If you were gonna bite me,
I don't think you'd warn me, huh?

01:24:35.888 --> 01:24:37.682
Find out.

01:25:55.843 --> 01:25:57.470
I can't sleep.

01:26:03.684 --> 01:26:07.813
I hope you don't mind us
laying out tonight here, sir.

01:26:08.648 --> 01:26:11.567
Whatever takes your fancy,
my young friend.

01:26:19.992 --> 01:26:24.497
Is it your shoulder
that's keeping you up?

01:26:24.664 --> 01:26:27.416
No, I don't never sleep too much.

01:26:27.792 --> 01:26:32.171
I have to sleep with one eye open.
I only got one eye, right?

01:26:36.842 --> 01:26:39.679
How old are you, Amsterdam?

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:46.769
I'm not too sure.

01:26:46.936 --> 01:26:48.688
I never did figure it.

01:26:50.022 --> 01:26:52.233
I'm 47.

01:26:54.151 --> 01:26:56.529
Forty-seven years old.

01:27:00.283 --> 01:27:03.953
You know how I stayed alive this long?
All these years?

01:27:06.539 --> 01:27:08.541
Fear.

01:27:10.209 --> 01:27:13.212
The spectacle of fearsome acts.

01:27:14.213 --> 01:27:17.383
Somebody steals from me,
I cut off his hands.

01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:20.678
He offends me,
I cut out his tongue.

01:27:20.845 --> 01:27:26.350
He rises against me,
I cut off his head, stick it on a pike...

01:27:26.517 --> 01:27:30.563
and raise it high up
so all in the streets can see.

01:27:31.647 --> 01:27:35.067
That's what preserves
the order of things.

01:27:38.613 --> 01:27:40.323
Fear.

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:44.744
That one tonight...

01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:47.038
who was he?

01:27:48.623 --> 01:27:50.625
A nobody.

01:27:51.584 --> 01:27:53.586
A coward.

01:27:55.212 --> 01:27:59.216
What an ignominious end
that would have been.

01:28:02.219 --> 01:28:07.558
I killed the last honorable man
15 years ago. Since then, it's...

01:28:09.769 --> 01:28:12.772
You've seen his portrait downstairs?

01:28:16.108 --> 01:28:19.445
Is your mouth glued up with
cunny juice? I asked you a question!

01:28:19.612 --> 01:28:21.906
I said, I seen it, sir.

01:28:27.161 --> 01:28:30.289
Oh, you got a murderous rage
in you, and I like it.

01:28:30.456 --> 01:28:34.627
It's life boiling up inside of you.
It's good.

01:28:38.172 --> 01:28:42.635
The Priest and me,
we lived by the same principles.

01:28:44.971 --> 01:28:48.099
It was only faith divided us.

01:28:50.476 --> 01:28:52.269
He give me this, you know.

01:28:57.984 --> 01:29:01.320
That was the finest beating
I ever took.

01:29:01.946 --> 01:29:03.489
My face was pulp...

01:29:03.656 --> 01:29:07.451
my guts was pierced
and my ribs was all mashed up.

01:29:11.998 --> 01:29:14.792
And when he came to finish me...

01:29:18.754 --> 01:29:21.549
I couldn't look him in the eye.

01:29:27.471 --> 01:29:32.351
He spared me because
he wanted me to live in shame.

01:29:32.518 --> 01:29:35.021
This was a great man.

01:29:37.690 --> 01:29:39.734
A great man.

01:29:42.653 --> 01:29:45.865
So I cut out the eye that looked away.

01:29:48.701 --> 01:29:51.203
Sent it to him, wrapped in blue paper.

01:29:52.121 --> 01:29:55.875
I would have cut them both out
if I could have fought him blind.

01:29:57.877 --> 01:30:00.963
Then I rose back up again
with a full heart...

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:03.966
and buried him in his own blood.

01:30:12.975 --> 01:30:14.977
Well done.

01:30:17.855 --> 01:30:21.484
He was the only man I ever killed
worth remembering.

01:30:33.079 --> 01:30:35.623
I never had a son.

01:30:43.798 --> 01:30:46.717
Civilization is crumbling.

01:31:04.944 --> 01:31:07.280
God bless you.

01:31:38.252 --> 01:31:41.005
If you got anything to say...

01:31:41.589 --> 01:31:44.341
now is the time to say it.

01:31:44.508 --> 01:31:46.719
Who is he to you, Jenny?

01:31:52.933 --> 01:31:55.519
I was 12 years old.

01:31:55.686 --> 01:31:59.440
My mother was dead.
I was living in a doorway.

01:32:01.776 --> 01:32:06.280
He took me in, took care of me...

01:32:07.114 --> 01:32:09.200
in his own way.

01:32:14.246 --> 01:32:16.916
After they cut out the baby...

01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:23.130
Well, he doesn't fancy girls
that scarred up.

01:32:29.970 --> 01:32:34.475
You should know in your own mind...

01:32:35.684 --> 01:32:39.772
that he never laid a hand on me
until I asked him to.

01:33:02.211 --> 01:33:04.505
Who are you?

01:33:05.381 --> 01:33:07.883
Who are you?

01:34:24.585 --> 01:34:28.172
Gentlemen. Fine gentlemen,
you are most welcome...

01:34:28.339 --> 01:34:32.093
to this palace of wonder
and enchantment...

01:34:32.259 --> 01:34:37.264
where visions to rival the finest
imaginings of Scheherezade...

01:34:37.431 --> 01:34:40.434
and her tales from
the perfumed nights of Arabia...

01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:44.605
will greet your famished eyes.

01:35:03.249 --> 01:35:06.752
What am I bid for this
flaxen-haired Teutonic beauty?

01:35:07.253 --> 01:35:12.591
Feast your eyes on the magnificent
plumage of these exotic creatures.

01:35:12.758 --> 01:35:15.719
Gentlemen, you've seen
our caged birds.

01:35:15.886 --> 01:35:20.099
Well, how'd you like
to make them sing?

01:35:20.266 --> 01:35:26.439
Let me see the color of your money,
and they could be singing for you.

01:35:32.445 --> 01:35:35.948
May God put the steel of the Holy Spirit
in my spine...

01:35:37.241 --> 01:35:40.786
and the love of the Blessed Virgin
in my heart.

01:35:43.747 --> 01:35:45.749
Amen.

01:35:49.587 --> 01:35:51.589
Easy now.

01:35:51.755 --> 01:35:53.591
What did you say?

01:35:53.758 --> 01:35:56.260
He's not who he says he is.

01:35:57.136 --> 01:35:58.929
He's not who he says he is?

01:35:59.096 --> 01:36:03.142
What am I bid? What am I bid?
What am I bid?

01:36:03.517 --> 01:36:06.937
Count your blessings
he considers you a friend.

01:36:08.105 --> 01:36:13.277
The only thing he considers, every day
and every night, is how best to kill you.

01:36:14.612 --> 01:36:18.449
You got a loose tongue in your head.
You want me to take it out for you?

01:36:18.616 --> 01:36:21.869
I'll bury it right up your fundament
where it belongs.

01:36:22.036 --> 01:36:24.288
I can read right through you.
You're empty...

01:36:24.455 --> 01:36:26.874
His name is Vallon!

01:36:28.459 --> 01:36:32.463
Don't do it, Bill. His name's Vallon.

01:37:03.994 --> 01:37:06.705
They're curious people,
these Celestials.

01:37:06.872 --> 01:37:08.165
Don't trust this guy.

01:37:08.332 --> 01:37:10.334
- Know why he wears short sleeves?
- Why?

01:37:10.501 --> 01:37:12.837
So everyone can see
he's got nothing stashed.

01:37:13.087 --> 01:37:16.215
Jesus, let's hope that never
becomes the fashion.

01:37:22.555 --> 01:37:24.390
Johnny.

01:38:01.677 --> 01:38:03.471
Get up.

01:38:18.194 --> 01:38:23.449
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I may have your kind attention.

01:38:23.616 --> 01:38:26.118
As some of you have surely noticed...

01:38:26.285 --> 01:38:30.289
our friend and benefactor
Mr. William Cutting...

01:38:30.456 --> 01:38:36.837
is tonight wearing a waistcoat
of certain distinction.

01:38:37.963 --> 01:38:39.590
Might we...

01:38:41.258 --> 01:38:44.804
Might we tonight appeal
to him to favor us...

01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:49.225
with another exciting exhibition
of skill...

01:38:49.391 --> 01:38:54.730
courage, daring and drama!

01:39:06.992 --> 01:39:11.664
- The Sword of Damascus!
- The Tomahawk!

01:39:13.332 --> 01:39:15.000
Bill's going up.

01:39:22.007 --> 01:39:23.926
Show us your knives.

01:39:24.093 --> 01:39:26.637
Strut your stuff, Billy boy.

01:39:26.804 --> 01:39:29.181
Sword of Damascus!

01:39:43.028 --> 01:39:46.198
- The Spider's Kiss!
- The River of Blood!

01:39:46.365 --> 01:39:49.994
- The Morning Glory!
- The Wheel of Death!

01:39:50.161 --> 01:39:52.371
- William Tell!
- The Butterfly!

01:39:52.705 --> 01:39:54.498
- The Tomahawk!
- The Spider's Kiss!

01:39:54.874 --> 01:39:56.709
The Butcher's Apprentice!

01:39:56.876 --> 01:39:58.252
The Butcher's Apprentice.

01:39:58.419 --> 01:40:01.714
- Command performance.
- Command performance.

01:40:01.964 --> 01:40:04.216
- Command performance.
- Where have you been?

01:40:04.383 --> 01:40:06.886
A command performance indeed!

01:40:07.052 --> 01:40:08.721
- Get out of here.
- Don't do it.

01:40:08.888 --> 01:40:13.517
And for this I must beg the indulgence
of my former assistant...

01:40:13.684 --> 01:40:16.145
in matters of impalement.

01:40:16.312 --> 01:40:19.732
The Butcher's original apprentice.

01:40:20.566 --> 01:40:25.696
What do you say, Jen?
One more time for the sweet souvenir?

01:40:25.863 --> 01:40:27.740
Come on.

01:40:37.082 --> 01:40:39.210
Don't you do it.

01:40:39.877 --> 01:40:42.087
Good girl, Jenny.

01:40:42.254 --> 01:40:46.092
- Don't be afraid.
- What a woman.

01:40:48.719 --> 01:40:50.554
Good evening, Bill.

01:40:50.721 --> 01:40:52.765
She'll be all right.

01:40:55.559 --> 01:40:58.729
- Remember this?
- Of course.

01:41:07.446 --> 01:41:12.618
You may feel more comfortable
without that garment, Miss Everdeane.

01:41:13.786 --> 01:41:16.956
You'll have to filch me a new one, Bill.

01:41:30.261 --> 01:41:32.763
Anything in your pockets tonight?

01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:35.266
Oh, I ain't started working yet.

01:41:38.436 --> 01:41:41.313
What about that locket
that I gave you?

01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:59.999
Apologies, my dear. Pick it up.

01:42:04.837 --> 01:42:06.797
Whoopsie-daisy!

01:42:08.799 --> 01:42:11.302
Now it's good and broke.

01:42:12.303 --> 01:42:14.805
I can't seem to get anything
right tonight.

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.317
You got the sand to give them
a grand finale?

01:42:34.492 --> 01:42:37.745
Maybe when you're aiming
a little straighter.

01:42:45.419 --> 01:42:50.007
Still got some blood in you, Jen?
Enough of this heathen music!

01:42:50.174 --> 01:42:53.344
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.
Strike up, boys!

01:42:53.511 --> 01:42:58.933
Ready? This is a night for Americans!

01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:08.442
- Jenny!
- Get your hands off me.

01:43:08.609 --> 01:43:11.695
- Go away.
- Get your hands off me!

01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:16.033
Move.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.285
Amsterdam!

01:44:03.456 --> 01:44:05.666
Hats off!

01:44:12.173 --> 01:44:16.886
We hold in our hearts the memory
of our fallen brothers...

01:44:17.136 --> 01:44:20.639
whose blood stains the very streets
we walk today.

01:44:22.224 --> 01:44:27.980
Also on this night, we pay tribute
to the leader of our enemies...

01:44:29.732 --> 01:44:34.653
an honorable man
who crossed over bravely...

01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:37.490
fighting for what he believed in.

01:44:43.662 --> 01:44:48.334
To defeat my enemy,
I extinguish his life...

01:44:48.501 --> 01:44:52.505
and consume him
as I consume these flames.

01:44:53.923 --> 01:44:56.175
In honor of Priest Vallon.

01:45:04.683 --> 01:45:06.227
That's a wound.

01:45:06.602 --> 01:45:08.938
God!

01:45:15.486 --> 01:45:20.616
I want you all to meet
the son of Priest Vallon.

01:45:20.783 --> 01:45:23.452
I took him under my wing...

01:45:23.619 --> 01:45:25.371
and see how I'm repaid?

01:45:25.538 --> 01:45:27.706
- You bastard!
- Saves my life one day...

01:45:27.873 --> 01:45:30.459
so he can kill me the next
like a sneak-thief...

01:45:30.626 --> 01:45:33.629
instead of fighting like a man.

01:45:34.046 --> 01:45:38.342
A base defiler,
unworthy of a noble name.

01:45:40.719 --> 01:45:43.180
God! Jesus!

01:45:51.564 --> 01:45:54.650
All right, that'll do, McGloin.
Splay him out.

01:45:55.776 --> 01:46:00.573
This show ain't for blackies.
You! You get to watch.

01:46:02.074 --> 01:46:04.743
Don't you hear, nigger?

01:46:06.162 --> 01:46:09.915
This is fresh meat.
You know what I mean?

01:46:10.082 --> 01:46:13.419
We need to tenderize this meat
a little bit.

01:46:13.586 --> 01:46:17.423
All right, let's kiss good night
to that pretty young face of yours.

01:46:22.052 --> 01:46:23.262
No!

01:46:27.808 --> 01:46:29.769
No!

01:46:30.895 --> 01:46:34.774
What'll it be, then? Rib or chop?
Loin or shank?

01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.942
- The liver!
- The spleen!

01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:38.819
- The tongue!
- Kidneys!

01:46:45.117 --> 01:46:47.286
- The lungs!
- The liver!

01:46:47.453 --> 01:46:49.288
- The tongue!
- The kidneys!

01:46:49.455 --> 01:46:51.791
- The stomach!
- The heart! The heart!

01:46:51.957 --> 01:46:54.460
The heart? This boy has no heart.

01:46:54.627 --> 01:46:57.421
- Then kill him!
- Kill him!

01:47:02.635 --> 01:47:07.306
He ain't earned a death.
He ain't earned a death at my hands.

01:47:07.598 --> 01:47:12.103
No. He'll walk amongst you
marked with shame...

01:47:12.269 --> 01:47:17.650
a freak worthy of Barnum's
Museum of Wonders.

01:47:17.817 --> 01:47:21.278
God's only man spared
by the Butcher.

01:47:21.445 --> 01:47:22.863
No, Bill!

01:47:24.031 --> 01:47:27.034
No! No!

01:47:27.368 --> 01:47:30.871
No! No! No!

01:47:31.038 --> 01:47:34.500
No! No! No!

01:48:00.901 --> 01:48:03.070
Here. Here!

01:48:03.237 --> 01:48:05.698
This way. Come on. Come on!

01:48:51.744 --> 01:48:54.038
I wanna show you something.

01:48:58.918 --> 01:49:02.088
My mother's bones share this grave.

01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:08.761
I've saved 10 cents out of every dollar
I've ever earned since I was 13.

01:49:08.928 --> 01:49:11.055
That's $ 215.

01:49:11.222 --> 01:49:17.019
That's $215 for budgeting
and the rest.

01:49:20.439 --> 01:49:24.276
This is what I wanted to show you.

01:49:24.443 --> 01:49:27.113
This is where we're gonna go
as soon as you get well.

01:49:27.863 --> 01:49:32.326
San Francisco, California.

01:49:35.037 --> 01:49:37.706
You can have anything you want
out there.

01:49:37.873 --> 01:49:43.754
These men are pulling gold right out
of the river with their own hands.

01:49:45.548 --> 01:49:49.885
We're here, and we need to get there.

01:49:50.636 --> 01:49:56.142
We start here, go down around here...

01:49:58.227 --> 01:50:00.855
to San Francisco.

01:50:02.398 --> 01:50:04.442
Shortest way to go.

01:50:05.234 --> 01:50:07.736
Would you go with me?

01:50:32.344 --> 01:50:36.098
No need to fire that, miss.
Or even aim it.

01:50:36.599 --> 01:50:40.019
An audience with your mangled friend
is all I want.

01:50:55.451 --> 01:50:57.536
I got 44 notches in my club.

01:50:59.872 --> 01:51:01.791
Do you know what they're for?

01:51:03.959 --> 01:51:06.879
To remind me of what I owe God
when I die.

01:51:13.886 --> 01:51:16.722
My father was killed in battle too.

01:51:17.389 --> 01:51:20.392
In Ireland, in the streets...

01:51:22.061 --> 01:51:24.814
fighting those who would take
as their privilege...

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:29.235
what could only be got and held
by the decimation of a race.

01:51:29.902 --> 01:51:33.239
That war is 1,000 years old or more.

01:51:33.906 --> 01:51:36.826
We never expected it to follow us here.

01:51:38.744 --> 01:51:40.830
It didn't.

01:51:40.996 --> 01:51:43.666
It was waiting for us when we landed.

01:51:47.336 --> 01:51:51.757
Your father tried to carve out a corner
in this country for his tribe.

01:51:53.551 --> 01:51:56.429
That was him.
That was his 'Dead Rabbits'.

01:51:59.348 --> 01:52:02.935
I often wondered,
if he'd lived a bit longer...

01:52:03.769 --> 01:52:06.439
would he have wanted a bit more?

01:52:17.783 --> 01:52:21.078
Why'd you rifle through
his pockets then?

01:52:38.137 --> 01:52:40.598
For safekeeping.

01:52:43.476 --> 01:52:45.936
I thought maybe you could do with it.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:10.628
The blood stays on the blade.

01:54:27.246 --> 01:54:29.415
That's a sorry-looking pelt.

01:54:33.961 --> 01:54:37.965
And it's been so nice and quiet
for the last three months.

01:54:40.134 --> 01:54:43.763
Tell me, this charge,
does it sit uneasy with you?

01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:47.099
No, it's...

01:54:47.975 --> 01:54:50.478
not uneasy, Bill.

01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:53.814
No, I wouldn't say that.

01:54:55.775 --> 01:55:00.946
But my allegiance is to the law.

01:55:01.989 --> 01:55:04.658
I'm paid to uphold the law.

01:55:20.549 --> 01:55:24.053
What in heaven's name
are you talking about?

01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:30.893
You may have misgivings,
but don't go believing that.

01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.729
That way lies damnation.

01:55:36.899 --> 01:55:39.985
I'm in no danger of damnation, Bill.

01:55:51.163 --> 01:55:53.416
Here's the thing.

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.461
I don't give a tuppenny fuck
about your moral conundrum...

01:55:57.628 --> 01:56:00.589
you meat-headed shit-sack.

01:56:01.924 --> 01:56:04.677
That's more or less the thing.

01:56:06.011 --> 01:56:09.181
And I want you to go out there...
You, nobody else.

01:56:09.348 --> 01:56:13.769
None of your little minions.
I want you to go out there...

01:56:13.936 --> 01:56:16.105
and I want you...

01:56:17.022 --> 01:56:20.943
to punish the person...

01:56:21.110 --> 01:56:23.612
who's responsible...

01:56:25.698 --> 01:56:30.453
for murdering
this poor little rabbit.

01:56:36.459 --> 01:56:38.627
Is that understood?

01:56:42.465 --> 01:56:44.216
Right.

01:56:45.468 --> 01:56:49.054
Help yourself to some decent meat
on the way out.

01:57:26.217 --> 01:57:28.052
Damn it.

01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.764
Is that you, boy?

01:57:32.765 --> 01:57:35.309
I didn't mean nothing
by that shot, you know.

01:57:36.769 --> 01:57:39.563
You scared me is all.

01:57:41.732 --> 01:57:44.610
Sure you know I'd never do you harm.

01:57:45.444 --> 01:57:47.905
Come out now, lad.

01:57:50.116 --> 01:57:52.910
Remember your father and me.

01:57:55.955 --> 01:57:59.750
Are you too young to remember
your old Uncle Jack?

01:58:01.585 --> 01:58:04.255
Oh, the times we had.

01:58:09.802 --> 01:58:12.263
You know I won't hurt you.

01:58:33.868 --> 01:58:35.953
Is he dead?

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:39.540
I'm gonna get Andrew.
Andrew, come see.

01:58:39.707 --> 01:58:43.961
Andrew, come see, quick!
Everybody, quick!

01:58:44.128 --> 01:58:48.799
This is bad for everybody.
What's next? Dead politicians?

01:58:49.717 --> 01:58:54.889
I could spare half a dozen of you
easier than I can spare him.

01:58:55.639 --> 01:58:59.393
Still, I think it shows dash.

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:03.564
Give the boy some time.
We'll settle with a good dustup.

01:59:46.941 --> 01:59:50.444
There's more of us coming
off these ships every day.

01:59:51.112 --> 01:59:54.782
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.

01:59:55.783 --> 01:59:58.244
And we're afraid of the Natives.

02:00:00.246 --> 02:00:04.750
Get all of us together,
we ain't got a gang. We got an army.

02:00:04.917 --> 02:00:07.586
And all you need's a spark, right?
Just one spark.

02:00:07.753 --> 02:00:10.297
Something to wake us all up.

02:00:26.856 --> 02:00:29.525
It was me played you false.

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:34.947
- I'd take it back if I could.
- Take it back?

02:00:38.534 --> 02:00:41.120
Johnny, I gotta kill you.

02:00:54.884 --> 02:00:58.137
Get out of the Points
and don't come back.

02:01:05.644 --> 02:01:08.063
Where you going, boyo?

02:01:09.064 --> 02:01:10.566
Come along.

02:01:10.733 --> 02:01:12.568
Come on.

02:01:14.987 --> 02:01:17.907
Tell us, John, what's the trouble?

02:01:18.741 --> 02:01:20.534
No trouble, Bill.

02:01:23.579 --> 02:01:26.207
Still hiding out with your friends?

02:01:29.335 --> 02:01:34.006
No, I'm... I'm not with them, Bill.

02:01:34.173 --> 02:01:37.301
I'm with you. I'm with the Natives.

02:01:41.847 --> 02:01:46.102
You always was a Native
as far as I'm interested, John...

02:01:48.437 --> 02:01:51.357
till you became a stag.

02:01:54.777 --> 02:01:58.447
You tell me you're a Native.
Do you want to know what a Native is?

02:02:00.282 --> 02:02:03.786
A Native is a man...

02:02:03.953 --> 02:02:08.666
what's willing to give his life
for his country...

02:02:10.543 --> 02:02:12.878
like my father done.

02:02:15.965 --> 02:02:19.969
Are you willing to do that,
my young friend?

02:02:28.894 --> 02:02:32.148
John. Johnny!

02:02:39.655 --> 02:02:41.657
Johnny?

02:02:51.083 --> 02:02:53.085
John...

02:03:05.347 --> 02:03:08.184
It hurts too much.

02:03:14.231 --> 02:03:16.400
Just kill me.

02:03:20.946 --> 02:03:23.407
Just kill me.

02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:28.245
Please, please.

02:03:35.753 --> 02:03:37.797
Please.

02:03:40.049 --> 02:03:41.967
Please.

02:03:46.097 --> 02:03:48.599
I'm sorry, Johnny.

02:04:03.989 --> 02:04:06.450
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

02:04:06.617 --> 02:04:10.121
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:13.165
Rest in peace, Ma.

02:04:15.876 --> 02:04:18.295
What're you doing here, boyo?

02:04:24.552 --> 02:04:27.888
What's a nigger doing in this church?

02:04:32.143 --> 02:04:34.395
What's a Dead Rabbit doing
with the Natives?

02:04:34.562 --> 02:04:37.731
There's no niggers in the Natives.
Natives and Rabbits is one thing.

02:04:37.898 --> 02:04:39.900
A nigger in the church
is something else!

02:04:40.067 --> 02:04:41.986
You run with the Natives,
pray with them!

02:04:42.153 --> 02:04:45.281
You're gonna wind up on a stake
like your man did!

02:04:46.031 --> 02:04:47.324
McGloin.

02:04:47.491 --> 02:04:51.912
Father! Jesus, did you know
there's a nigger in your church?

02:05:09.930 --> 02:05:12.433
Jesus.

02:05:34.914 --> 02:05:37.458
The earth turns...

02:05:38.250 --> 02:05:40.961
but we don't feel it move.

02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:46.425
Then one night you look up.

02:05:47.426 --> 02:05:52.598
One spark, and the sky is on fire.

02:06:03.818 --> 02:06:06.779
It's a touching spectacle.

02:06:08.489 --> 02:06:11.617
We'll come back
when you're ready for us.

02:06:17.873 --> 02:06:21.710
The past is the torch
that lights our way.

02:06:21.961 --> 02:06:27.383
Where our fathers have shown us
the path, we shall follow.

02:06:29.218 --> 02:06:33.556
Our faith is the weapon most feared
by our enemies.

02:06:33.806 --> 02:06:38.727
For thereby shall we lift our people up
against those who would destroy us.

02:06:38.894 --> 02:06:43.816
Our name is called the 'Dead Rabbits'
to remind all of our suffering...

02:06:43.983 --> 02:06:47.862
and as a call to those who suffer still
to join our ranks...

02:06:48.028 --> 02:06:52.825
however so far they may have strayed
from our common home across the sea.

02:06:52.992 --> 02:06:56.662
For with great numbers
must come great strength...

02:06:58.414 --> 02:07:00.583
and the salvation of our people.

02:07:01.083 --> 02:07:03.461
- We don't want your business.
- How many men live here?

02:07:03.627 --> 02:07:06.172
- You have to register.
- You can't force me to join.

02:07:06.338 --> 02:07:08.007
- Have you got $300?
- Of course not.

02:07:08.174 --> 02:07:11.635
- Who's got $300?
- If you're drafted, release from service...

02:07:11.802 --> 02:07:15.222
can only be secured for $300,
according to the Conscription Act.

02:07:15.389 --> 02:07:18.017
- Otherwise, you have to serve!
- Who the hell's got $300?

02:07:18.184 --> 02:07:21.854
You have to serve, sir,
unless you have $300!

02:07:22.021 --> 02:07:23.981
- Boys!
- Go back to where you came from!

02:07:24.148 --> 02:07:28.527
I'm born in this country. You immigrated
here. You will fight for this country!

02:07:28.694 --> 02:07:31.363
Sweet Jesus!
War does terrible things to men.

02:07:31.530 --> 02:07:37.536
- Get back uptown where you belong!
- $300? So it's another rich man's war.

02:07:37.703 --> 02:07:40.831
Sir, I request an audience
with this man.

02:07:42.875 --> 02:07:45.044
No one speak English
in New York anymore?

02:07:45.211 --> 02:07:47.338
- Don't understand.
- You do speak English.

02:07:49.256 --> 02:07:53.677
I wonder if Miss Everdeane could
angle her rifle in some other direction.

02:07:59.016 --> 02:08:03.771
I wonder, Mr. Vallon, if you understand
the true value of this sort of publicity.

02:08:07.691 --> 02:08:11.654
The archbishop himself, shoulder to
shoulder with the Irish in the Five Points.

02:08:12.196 --> 02:08:15.366
I'm offering to form an alliance
with you against Bill Cutting...

02:08:15.533 --> 02:08:18.244
and his slate
of Nativist candidates.

02:08:18.411 --> 02:08:22.415
I'll negotiate a handsome fee for every
Irish vote you send Tammany's way...

02:08:22.581 --> 02:08:24.917
in the coming elections.

02:08:26.377 --> 02:08:29.547
I need a new friend
in the Five Points, son.

02:08:32.591 --> 02:08:35.052
I'd like that friend to be you.

02:08:38.264 --> 02:08:40.975
Now, just a moment, Mr. Tweed.

02:08:41.142 --> 02:08:44.353
Suppose we do
get you those votes.

02:08:46.689 --> 02:08:48.941
Would you back an Irish candidate
of my choosing?

02:08:49.108 --> 02:08:52.111
- I don't think so.
- What if we get you all the Irish votes?

02:08:52.403 --> 02:08:56.115
That will only happen
in the reign of Queen Dick.

02:08:58.117 --> 02:09:00.327
- Beg your pardon?
- It will never happen.

02:09:00.494 --> 02:09:03.956
I might be persuaded to back an
Irish candidate for, say, alderman.

02:09:04.123 --> 02:09:06.917
- Alderman?
- We've already got Irish aldermen.

02:09:07.084 --> 02:09:10.463
- So we have. That's why...
- Well, what's bigger than alderman?

02:09:11.922 --> 02:09:15.718
Sheriff. Sheriff.
All right, Mr. Tweed.

02:09:15.885 --> 02:09:19.847
You back an Irishman for sheriff
of the city and county of New York...

02:09:20.014 --> 02:09:21.390
and we'll get him elected.

02:09:21.557 --> 02:09:24.935
I love the Irish, but higher than alderman
you shall never climb.

02:09:25.102 --> 02:09:27.605
- Well, why not?
- For one thing, no man living...

02:09:27.772 --> 02:09:29.565
- can consolidate the Irish vote.
- I can.

02:09:29.732 --> 02:09:31.942
And for another,
I mean no effrontery...

02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:36.363
no one's yet found an Irish candidate
for sheriff worth voting for.

02:09:38.741 --> 02:09:40.117
Monk.

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.495
Here.

02:09:46.999 --> 02:09:49.668
He's to have me looking as sober
as me own grandfather.

02:09:49.835 --> 02:09:54.006
- Another great man, I'm sure.
- A thorough drunken bastard.

02:09:56.008 --> 02:09:57.802
Could I say what I want?

02:09:58.969 --> 02:10:01.305
Well, that's why I wanted you.

02:10:01.472 --> 02:10:04.391
Our elected representatives
are a gang of thieves...

02:10:04.558 --> 02:10:06.310
who swear to better our lot...

02:10:06.477 --> 02:10:09.355
while dipping their hands deep
into our pockets.

02:10:09.522 --> 02:10:13.234
I stand shoulder to shoulder with
community leaders like Bill Cutting...

02:10:13.651 --> 02:10:17.530
against any and all inroads
into our fine democracy.

02:10:17.696 --> 02:10:21.909
I'll see to it that no one takes away what
you've earned by pluck and application.

02:10:22.076 --> 02:10:24.161
To invading hordes of Hibernians!

02:10:24.328 --> 02:10:28.374
You go to the polls and you put your
mark next to the name Walter McGinn.

02:10:28.541 --> 02:10:33.212
Against the potato eaters, like them
over there, thieving our jobs!

02:10:33.379 --> 02:10:35.756
Why should so many
Irish die down south...

02:10:35.923 --> 02:10:40.553
when the first war to win is not down
in Dixie, but right here in these streets?

02:10:42.388 --> 02:10:45.182
And who's the finest street fighter
in the Five Points?

02:10:45.391 --> 02:10:47.560
- Monk!
- That's right.

02:10:47.726 --> 02:10:50.479
Now, let the whole damn city hear it!

02:10:51.897 --> 02:10:53.732
That man was right born for this.

02:10:53.899 --> 02:10:56.944
Well, he's killed 44 men,
laid low a couple hundred more.

02:10:57.111 --> 02:10:58.779
- Is that right?
- That's right.

02:10:58.946 --> 02:11:01.031
I should have run him for mayor.

02:11:03.242 --> 02:11:06.537
All right, line them up.
It's election day!

02:11:07.037 --> 02:11:10.374
Not so fast,
you little yellow bastard!

02:11:10.583 --> 02:11:12.418
Come on!

02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:18.132
Come on, you bastard,
we need your vote.

02:11:18.299 --> 02:11:21.719
Bastard? I fought for you, nigger.
I lost an arm for you.

02:11:21.886 --> 02:11:23.721
Well, that's a start.
Now, come on.

02:11:23.888 --> 02:11:25.639
Rise and shine.
Rise and shine.

02:11:25.806 --> 02:11:28.976
In this great country of ours,
even the hop fiends get to vote!

02:11:30.269 --> 02:11:32.104
Less art and more haste, Don.

02:11:32.271 --> 02:11:34.774
- Where are you going?
- I already voted today.

02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:37.943
Cast for Monk and Tammany,
by God. Twice.

02:11:38.110 --> 02:11:41.947
Twice? Only twice? You call that doing
your civic duty? Come with me.

02:11:42.114 --> 02:11:44.742
Oh, no, you don't.
Get back and sit down.

02:11:44.909 --> 02:11:46.994
Here's another one.
Clean him up good.

02:11:47.161 --> 02:11:49.830
Shave their beards and send them back
to vote again.

02:11:49.997 --> 02:11:52.875
All right, boys. Vote Monk, Tammany.
Monk, Tammany!

02:11:53.042 --> 02:11:56.128
So, gentlemen, what our great city
needs is a new courthouse.

02:11:56.295 --> 02:11:59.173
I propose it should be a modest,
economical structure.

02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:01.133
Excuse me one moment.

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:04.845
Monk's already won by 3,000
more votes than there are voters.

02:12:05.012 --> 02:12:08.557
Three? Make it 20, 30. We don't need
a victory. We need a Roman triumph!

02:12:08.724 --> 02:12:12.978
- But we don't have any more ballots.
- Remember the first rule of politics:

02:12:13.145 --> 02:12:16.524
The ballots don't make the results,
the counters make the results.

02:12:16.690 --> 02:12:17.817
Keep counting.

02:12:49.682 --> 02:12:51.684
It's from Bill.

02:12:55.104 --> 02:12:56.689
Monk.

02:13:16.417 --> 02:13:19.420
Citizens of the Five Points...

02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:23.841
Mr. Bill Cutting is attempting
to draw me into an argument...

02:13:24.008 --> 02:13:28.596
that would no doubt end in bloodshed
and the compromising of my office.

02:13:29.263 --> 02:13:31.223
What do you think?

02:13:32.141 --> 02:13:35.811
Should I engage in silence
this relic of the ancient law?

02:13:35.978 --> 02:13:42.401
Or shall I be your chosen voice
in a new testament, in the new world?

02:13:48.365 --> 02:13:50.159
There you are, Bill.

02:13:51.786 --> 02:13:53.788
The people have spoken.

02:13:55.289 --> 02:13:59.376
The very notion of violent reprisal
benumbs them.

02:14:01.629 --> 02:14:03.255
Come on up.

02:14:03.839 --> 02:14:07.259
Let's see if we can resolve
our grievances the democratic way.

02:14:30.533 --> 02:14:35.329
That, my friends,
is the minority vote.

02:14:36.372 --> 02:14:40.418
Now you've tasted my mutton.
How do you like it?

02:14:40.584 --> 02:14:41.961
Look.

02:14:42.128 --> 02:14:44.672
I want you to see this.

02:14:47.508 --> 02:14:49.635
This is you. Right here.

02:14:49.802 --> 02:14:53.681
Notch 45, you Irish bog bastard.

02:15:05.151 --> 02:15:08.654
Why don't you burn him,
see if his ashes turn green.

02:15:13.951 --> 02:15:16.328
Fortune favors the bold!

02:15:28.758 --> 02:15:32.845
- You killed an elected official?
- Who elected him?

02:15:33.012 --> 02:15:36.182
You don't know what
you've done to yourself.

02:15:41.687 --> 02:15:44.231
I know your works.

02:15:44.857 --> 02:15:47.067
You are neither cold nor hot.

02:15:47.234 --> 02:15:51.530
So because you are lukewarm,
I will spew you out of my mouth.

02:15:53.115 --> 02:15:55.618
You can build your filthy world
without me.

02:15:55.785 --> 02:15:58.245
I took the father.
Now I'll take the son.

02:15:58.412 --> 02:16:03.334
You tell young Vallon I'm gonna
paint Paradise Square with his blood.

02:16:03.584 --> 02:16:05.169
Two coats.

02:16:05.753 --> 02:16:08.422
I'll festoon my bedchamber
with his guts.

02:16:08.589 --> 02:16:11.050
As for you,
Mr. Tammany-fucking-Hall...

02:16:11.217 --> 02:16:13.135
you come down
to the Points again...

02:16:13.302 --> 02:16:16.806
and you'll be dispatched
by mine own hand.

02:16:18.599 --> 02:16:23.979
Now get back to your celebration
and let me eat in peace. I paid you fair.

02:16:47.795 --> 02:16:49.504
Stop.

02:16:50.505 --> 02:16:52.091
Raise.

02:17:35.175 --> 02:17:37.428
You son of a bitch!

02:17:41.264 --> 02:17:43.267
Challenge.

02:17:44.643 --> 02:17:47.021
Challenge accepted.

02:18:38.697 --> 02:18:42.118
And then it came,
the first day of the draft.

02:18:42.284 --> 02:18:47.665
Thomas O'Neill. Andrew Lewis.
Joseph Flynn.

02:18:47.832 --> 02:18:51.043
They read out the draftees ' names
like they was dead already.

02:18:51.209 --> 02:18:55.548
Andrew Martin. J.B. Gleason.

02:18:55.714 --> 02:18:58.467
- The 'O'Connell Guard'.
- The 'Plug Uglies'.

02:18:58.634 --> 02:19:01.887
- As for us, the tribes were gathered.
- Forty Thieves.

02:19:02.221 --> 02:19:04.723
- The 'Chichesters'.
- The drums was beating.

02:19:04.889 --> 02:19:06.225
The 'Dead Rabbits'.

02:19:06.392 --> 02:19:09.352
- The American Guard.
- The Atlantic Guard.

02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:12.189
- The 'Slaughter Housers'.
- The Bowery Boys.

02:19:12.356 --> 02:19:14.691
The Confederation
of American Natives.

02:19:16.110 --> 02:19:17.236
James Mooney.

02:19:17.403 --> 02:19:20.906
But all we could see
was the hand in front of us.

02:19:21.073 --> 02:19:23.075
Sean O'Connell.

02:19:23.242 --> 02:19:27.413
G.W. Morris. John Doyle.

02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:30.249
- When?
- Whenever you like.

02:19:30.415 --> 02:19:32.626
- Daybreak tomorrow.
- Ground?

02:19:32.793 --> 02:19:34.920
Paradise Square.

02:19:35.087 --> 02:19:36.880
Weapons?

02:19:37.047 --> 02:19:42.303
- That I leave up to you.
- Bricks, bats, axes, knives...

02:19:42.636 --> 02:19:44.096
Pistols?

02:19:45.638 --> 02:19:47.099
No pistols.

02:19:48.225 --> 02:19:50.269
Good boy.

02:19:52.813 --> 02:19:55.858
The terms are resolved.
The council's concluded.

02:19:57.777 --> 02:20:01.822
Thomas McEvoy. W.H. Miles.

02:20:01.989 --> 02:20:05.076
- To hell with your damned draft!
- Give them hellfire, boys!

02:20:05.242 --> 02:20:06.786
Rip them apart!

02:20:13.834 --> 02:20:16.378
Kill the rich bastards!

02:20:22.593 --> 02:20:24.220
Uptown!

02:20:25.805 --> 02:20:27.598
You're not getting my son!

02:20:33.145 --> 02:20:35.815
Uptown at the draft office...

02:20:35.981 --> 02:20:41.028
the cops broke a few skulls,
and everybody run away.

02:20:42.029 --> 02:20:44.448
But the word was spreading...

02:20:44.615 --> 02:20:46.492
and the dark.

02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:49.036
Up on Fifth Avenue...

02:20:49.203 --> 02:20:52.540
the Schermerhorns and their mob
breathed a little easy.

02:20:52.706 --> 02:20:55.709
Just a brief burst of anger
over Mr. Lincoln's draft.

02:20:55.876 --> 02:20:58.129
Entirely justifiable in my view.

02:20:58.295 --> 02:21:02.007
- There are two sides to that question...
- There are several sides...

02:21:02.174 --> 02:21:04.718
but only one right side,
as with any question...

02:21:04.885 --> 02:21:07.179
that involves the abuse
of executive power.

02:21:07.346 --> 02:21:09.682
In any case, Mr. Greeley...

02:21:09.849 --> 02:21:12.560
we can all be thankful
that it wasn't any worse.

02:21:12.726 --> 02:21:15.855
It may be worse yet. I saw them.
I don't know what to think.

02:21:16.021 --> 02:21:19.233
Now what is it that you are
so fond of saying, Mr. Tweed?

02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:21.861
Mr. Greeley, you won't like this.
But what is it?

02:21:22.027 --> 02:21:23.070
I don't remember.

02:21:23.237 --> 02:21:27.992
"You can always hire one half
of the poor to kill the other half."

02:21:38.252 --> 02:21:40.588
I've come to say goodbye.

02:21:40.755 --> 02:21:43.716
I've booked passage for California.

02:21:46.218 --> 02:21:49.013
Jenny, give me one more day,
and I'll go with you.

02:21:49.180 --> 02:21:51.515
You'll be dead by then.

02:21:52.057 --> 02:21:55.519
- Well, what would you have me do?
- I don't know.

02:21:58.147 --> 02:22:01.901
- This will all be finished tomorrow.
- No, it won't.

02:22:03.527 --> 02:22:05.070
No.

02:22:05.488 --> 02:22:08.616
This whole place
is gonna burn anyway.

02:22:16.665 --> 02:22:21.420
I've heard that the poor are going
from door to door in the Five Points...

02:22:21.587 --> 02:22:25.132
asking those supporters
who wish to see further riots...

02:22:25.299 --> 02:22:28.427
to place a lighted candle
in the window.

02:22:28.844 --> 02:22:30.930
Irish, Poles, Germans, all of them.

02:22:31.722 --> 02:22:37.937
Mr. Greeley, the city is not mad.
I prophesy a very dark night.

02:23:00.167 --> 02:23:04.004
Nobody goes to work today!
We'll shut the factories down!

02:23:04.171 --> 02:23:08.592
When the sun rose next,
the city had split in half.

02:23:08.759 --> 02:23:10.594
From all over New York they came:

02:23:10.761 --> 02:23:13.597
Ironworkers, factory boys,
street cleaners...

02:23:13.764 --> 02:23:15.349
Irish, Polish, German...

02:23:15.516 --> 02:23:18.310
anyone who never cared
about slavery or the Union...

02:23:18.477 --> 02:23:21.063
anyone who couldn't buy his way out.

02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:24.233
"Let the sons of the rich
go and die", they cried.

02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:27.445
"Let the sons of the poor stay home."

02:23:28.821 --> 02:23:30.990
The earth was shaking now.

02:23:31.157 --> 02:23:33.868
But I was about my father's business.

02:23:38.956 --> 02:23:41.167
A bunch of fifth Avenue scums!

02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:52.845
Almighty Lord,
you are the dagger in my hand.

02:23:54.138 --> 02:23:56.515
Guide my hand
on this day of vengeance.

02:23:56.682 --> 02:24:00.686
We give thanks to the Lord,
for he is good.

02:24:00.853 --> 02:24:05.191
With you, the swift cannot flee,
nor the strong escape.

02:24:05.357 --> 02:24:09.528
Let my sword devour until its thirst
is quenched with blood...

02:24:09.695 --> 02:24:11.697
and my enemies sleep forever.

02:24:11.864 --> 02:24:14.241
For you are the Lord God of Retribution.

02:24:14.408 --> 02:24:16.869
For the Lord crushes the wicked.

02:24:17.036 --> 02:24:19.663
The Lord is merciful...

02:24:20.289 --> 02:24:24.085
and his love endures forever.

02:24:24.627 --> 02:24:26.003
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:24:26.170 --> 02:24:27.338
Amen.

02:24:33.344 --> 02:24:36.388
- Run away, you sons of bitches!
- Come on out!

02:24:38.933 --> 02:24:43.062
- Upstairs! Get the women upstairs!
- Father! Father!

02:24:46.899 --> 02:24:49.401
Let's take the bastards!

02:24:50.402 --> 02:24:54.407
From 18th Precinct: The mob are sacking
houses, 27th Street and Seventh Ave.

02:24:54.573 --> 02:24:55.950
We have no force to send.

02:24:56.117 --> 02:24:59.412
16th Precinct: All the stores
are closing on Eighth Avenue...

02:24:59.578 --> 02:25:01.580
from fear of the mob in 17th Street.

02:25:01.747 --> 02:25:04.250
Show us what you got,
you cowardly bastards!

02:25:06.043 --> 02:25:09.130
From 4th: The rioters are robbing
colored boarding houses...

02:25:09.296 --> 02:25:11.757
and setting them on fire.
From 21st:

02:25:13.134 --> 02:25:16.095
The mob have just broken open
gun store and are arming.

02:25:20.766 --> 02:25:23.310
- Get the nigger! Kill him!
- Tear Tammany down!

02:25:23.477 --> 02:25:26.689
The marshal's office is burning down.
The police is of no avail.

02:25:26.856 --> 02:25:27.940
Show yourself, Tweed!

02:25:28.107 --> 02:25:29.817

Tomorrow morning,
get our people down to the docks.

02:35:02.932 --> 02:35:07.478

the boats given hot soup and bread.

02:35:11.982 --> 02:35:15.486

down here tonight.

02:35:33.003 --> 02:35:37.842

on the bodies so's their friends...

02:35:38.008 --> 02:35:42.221
if they had any,
could know them in the dark.

02:35:43.389 --> 02:35:46.851
The city did this free of charge.

02:35:47.893 --> 02:35:53.941
Shang, Jimmy Spoils,
Hell-Cat, McGloin and more.

02:35:55.443 --> 02:35:59.905
Friend or foe,
it didn't make no difference now.

02:36:19.425 --> 02:36:25.431
It was four days and nights before the
worst of the mob was finally put down.

02:36:26.474 --> 02:36:29.143
We never knew how many
New Yorkers died that week...

02:36:29.310 --> 02:36:32.104
before the city was finally delivered.

02:36:33.481 --> 02:36:38.569
My father told me we was all born
of blood and tribulation.

02:36:39.695 --> 02:36:43.991
And so then too was our great city.

02:36:46.911 --> 02:36:51.665
But for those of us what lived
and died in them furious days...

02:36:51.832 --> 02:36:57.296
it was like everything we knew
was mightily swept away.

02:36:58.089 --> 02:37:01.217
And no matter what they did
to build the city up again...

02:37:03.469 --> 02:37:06.138
for the rest of time...

02:37:07.098 --> 02:37:11.393
it would be like no one even knew
we was ever here.
