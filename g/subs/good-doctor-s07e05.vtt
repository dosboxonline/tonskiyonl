00:01.175 --> 00:02.741
[Lea] Previously on
The Good Doctor...

00:02.785 --> 00:04.091
I'm Charlotte Lukaitis.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.789
-Charlie.
You are on my team.
-Yes!

00:06.832 --> 00:09.400
Positive affirmations are
empowering for people with ASD.

00:09.444 --> 00:10.575
My autism is awesome.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.403
We should prep
a bolus dose of TPA.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.275
No, we should not do that.

00:14.318 --> 00:17.321
You ordered a nurse
to prep an unindicated
and very risky medication.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.454
-I didn't order her.
I was just making a suggestion.
-Get out!

00:19.497 --> 00:22.892
I believe
your intense curiosity

00:22.935 --> 00:24.241
and attention to organization

00:24.285 --> 00:26.722
will one day make you
an excellent pathologist.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.332
I don't want to be
a pathologist.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.508
I just want to be
a surgeon like you.

00:30.552 --> 00:31.944
You're nothing like me.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.686
So much of my life
in Orthodox world.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.385
I still don't feel like
I know what I'm doing.

00:37.428 --> 00:38.995
I have so little figured out,

00:39.039 --> 00:40.562
except that
I'm really into you.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.870
-Mom?
-Hey, Audie.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.264
But what are you doing here?
Are you okay?

00:47.308 --> 00:50.659
Oh, I'm just here
for a drug trial.
For my hyperthyroid.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.878
You heard they're calling
a board meeting tomorrow?

00:52.922 --> 00:54.967
-Can you cover for me?
-I wish I could cover it.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.057
It would be preferable
to taking my mom shopping.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.232
I'll take her shopping.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.494
Thank you for your help.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.756
Oh, no. Happy to help.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.584
See, and here you are,
stuck with me.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.542
Oh! [chuckles] No.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.718
You have been very sweet.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.939
[fussing]

01:12.376 --> 01:13.943
[crying]

01:25.215 --> 01:26.695
-Should we just--
-No.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.089
Can't we just check on him?
It's been ten minutes.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.354
-Nine.
-I'm rounding up.

01:33.396 --> 01:36.661
You shouldn't. This process
is tiring and difficult.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.837
But once we finish,
we will all be happier

01:38.881 --> 01:40.664
and more well-rested.

01:40.709 --> 01:43.103
[crying continues]

01:43.146 --> 01:45.148
How does the crying
not bother you?

01:49.413 --> 01:51.198
In prehistoric times,

01:51.241 --> 01:53.113
when infants awoke in the night

01:53.156 --> 01:54.549
and didn't see their parents,

01:54.592 --> 01:57.551
it could mean they had
been killed by wild animals

01:57.595 --> 01:58.814
or competing tribes.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.642
Steve's cries
are designed by nature

02:00.685 --> 02:02.557
to alert other adults
to take care of him.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.645
Mm-hmm.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.429
How much longer?

02:07.301 --> 02:08.431
Ten seconds.

02:09.172 --> 02:10.913
Nine, eight--

02:10.955 --> 02:13.742
seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.049
Don't worry, Steve.
Mommy's coming.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.791
[alarm beeping]

02:24.448 --> 02:25.449
[beeping stops]

02:29.975 --> 02:31.107
Mm.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.370
Morning.

02:34.805 --> 02:36.243
Morning.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.722
That was fun.

02:37.766 --> 02:40.812
-[both chuckle]
-Yeah.

02:40.856 --> 02:41.944
Mm.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.166
I have to go, unfortunately.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.518
When's your first meeting?

02:56.350 --> 02:57.307
After this.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.051
I have a consult.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.748
No, Shaun, please stay.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.404
Sorry. I was, um...

03:09.014 --> 03:10.712
Sorry.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.409
I was just about to tell Shaun

03:12.453 --> 03:14.411
that he'll be working
with Charlie Lukaitis today.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.544
No, I'm going to work with Dom.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.502
Charlie is disruptive
and distracting.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.896
She should be failed
out of this rotation.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.637
That's a harsh assessment,

03:22.680 --> 03:25.248
and one you can't make until
she's completed her rotation.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.468
Then...

03:27.511 --> 03:29.687
I want to opt out of being
a teaching attending.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.168
You can't do that, Shaun.
This is a teaching hospital.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.865
You can't opt out.

03:33.909 --> 03:36.651
Well, actually, you can,
but you lose access
to the residents--

03:36.694 --> 03:37.869
Jordan, Kalu, Asher.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.349
I prefer to work alone.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.308
And you'd stick
to simple surgeries.

03:41.351 --> 03:44.224
Lap choles, appendectomies,
hernia repairs.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.574
Not to mention, you'd lose
a third of your salary.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.577
I cannot teach her.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.536
She interrupts me, and when
I point out her mistakes,

03:52.579 --> 03:54.364
she just argues with me.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.584
Well, why don't you stop
pointing out her mistakes?

03:56.627 --> 03:58.454
Why don't you start

03:58.499 --> 03:59.978
pointing out things
she does well?

04:00.675 --> 04:01.980
Why would I do that?

04:02.024 --> 04:04.287
Because when you criticize
people, they feel bad,

04:04.331 --> 04:05.984
and that leads to arguments.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.596
And that leads to Charlie
standing alone,
mute in an elevator.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.467
And that leads
to more meetings with us.

04:10.511 --> 04:13.731
I can't just
let her mistakes go.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.865
So, how about you try
a compliment sandwich?

04:16.908 --> 04:19.171
When you need to give
negative feedback,

04:19.214 --> 04:20.869
stick it between
layers of praise.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.960
Charlie...

04:25.003 --> 04:27.658
doesn't have two pieces
of bread to work with.

04:29.617 --> 04:33.229
Then make it a compliment
open-faced sandwich.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.667
Find the bread, Shaun.

04:40.409 --> 04:43.021
[theme music playing]

04:51.247 --> 04:53.031
-Hi, honey.
-Hey, you okay?

04:53.075 --> 04:54.859
Your door was closed
when I left.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.906
I wasn't there. I, um...

04:59.081 --> 05:01.213
stayed over at Aaron's.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.565
You... s-slept over there?

05:04.608 --> 05:05.783
Yes.

05:05.827 --> 05:06.871
-Like...
-Yes.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.310
I hope you don't have
a problem with that.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.225
You're a grown woman.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.880
That decided to have sex
with my co-president.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.707
Sure. That's... fine.

05:18.970 --> 05:19.971
Great.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.105
It was amazing, Audrey.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.846
I mean, for a man his age,

05:24.889 --> 05:29.677
you cannot believe the stamina
and the decisiveness.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.852
That's great, Mom.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.201
It's just sex.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.116
I'll be going home
after the study is over.

05:35.509 --> 05:39.207
But as sex goes,
this is pretty high quality.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.214
Where did you fall?

05:46.215 --> 05:48.130
In the shower.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.914
I hate how old that
makes me sound.

05:49.957 --> 05:52.221
Don't worry, you also lookold.

05:52.264 --> 05:53.570
Oh, thank you for that.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.922
BP's 100 over 70,
heart rate 75 BPMs.

05:57.966 --> 06:00.360
Hip bone's swollen
and deformed.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.709
Does this hurt?

06:01.752 --> 06:03.493
Ow! Ow!

06:03.537 --> 06:06.409
You have a fractured
and dislocated hip.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.150
Oh, no.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.673
Don't worry. We'll get him
to the OR right away.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.066
-Your dad will be fine.
-[chuckles]

06:11.109 --> 06:12.197
[chuckles lightly]

06:13.242 --> 06:14.243
He's my fiance.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.292
Then your fiance will be fine.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.951
Thank you.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.953
Hi! I know the last time
we worked together

06:28.997 --> 06:30.825
could have gone better.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.392
I always quote
the great Taylor Swift

06:32.435 --> 06:34.089
at important moments,

06:34.132 --> 06:35.960
-so let me just say--
-Don't do that.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.962
I promise I won't
interrupt you today.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.747
I'll work extra hard
to be helpful.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.534
What were you doing when
you first started throwing up?

06:45.579 --> 06:46.971
Walking with Mom.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.364
We weren't
overdoing it or anything.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.627
We walk together
every morning before school.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.542
It's our special time.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.370
That's awesome.
Do you know Mirna Valerio?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.373
She's a large-bodied woman
who runs ultramarathons.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.461
You could work
your way up to that.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.549
Or just marathons.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.116
That wasn't an interruption.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.554
It was...

07:04.598 --> 07:06.687
good that you did not
interrupt me,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.993
but you did not need
to tell that story.

07:10.299 --> 07:13.650
Although, it was not
completely irrelevant.

07:13.694 --> 07:16.653
With the fever and white count,
I thought she had a UTI.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.178
Lucy, please lie down.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.442
[winces]

07:25.706 --> 07:27.403
Take a deep breath.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.361
[Inhales deeply, groans]

07:29.405 --> 07:30.972
Positive Murphy sign.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.930
And it was spotted
by Dr. Murphy. So cool.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.584
It wasn't named after
Dr. Murphy, though.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.804
It is, in fact,
named after Dr. Murphy.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.545
-He just wasn't me.
-It's still cool.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.634
There's nothing cool about it,

07:40.677 --> 07:42.331
since it means Lucy's
gallbladder is inflamed

07:42.374 --> 07:43.854
and will need to be removed.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.857
Why would she be having
trouble with her gallbladder?

07:46.901 --> 07:48.598
Probably because
she's morbidly obese.

07:51.514 --> 07:52.646
But don't worry,

07:52.689 --> 07:53.995
we do the surgery every day.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.823
Not on teenagers, though.

08:00.915 --> 08:03.047
[Asher] I shouldn't
have assumed.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.441
Placing second guidewire.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.791
But are we all just
going to ignore
how gross this is?

08:07.835 --> 08:10.098
I mean, he's old enough
to be her grandfather.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.187
[Jerome] Lots of people
think it's gross that you
and I are together.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.623
[Asher] Yes, but we're
actually in love.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.277
Okay? She's gold-digging.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.672
-[Jerome] Another assumption.
-[Asher] A deduction, actually.

08:18.715 --> 08:21.588
If he's not loaded,
why would she be with him?

08:21.631 --> 08:23.067
Also, I found her Instagram.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.808
You should see the hotel
they stayed at in Baja.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.985
And they've been
engaged for a year,
but no wedding website.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.596
He's clearly stalling,

08:29.639 --> 08:32.424
trying to have
as much sex as he can
before tossing her.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.251
-[Jerome] He's 74.
-[Asher] Yeah.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.124
And a man.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.692
Implanting primary FNS screw.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.823
[Dr. Park] If she's
after his money
and he's after her youth,

08:40.868 --> 08:42.477
then they're both
getting something out of it.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.786
[Asher] Tightening
locking screw.

08:48.136 --> 08:51.879
[Jared] Dissecting
the gallbladder off the liver.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.621
Processed foods, sugary drinks,
schools dropping PE...

08:54.664 --> 08:57.275
No wonder there's an epidemic
of childhood obesity.

08:57.319 --> 09:00.496
[Charlie] Weight is a bad proxy
for health, actually. BMI, too.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.716
It doesn't take into account
muscle mass or metabolic--

09:02.759 --> 09:04.282
[Shaun] Excuse me.
What are you doing?

09:04.326 --> 09:06.894
[Jared] Oh, I, um--
I-I asked Charlie

09:06.937 --> 09:08.286
to learn the tools
by laying them out.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.812
[Shaun] Laparoscopic
instruments go on the left,

09:11.855 --> 09:13.422
then clamps, scissors,
retractors, and sutures.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.032
You have done the opposite.

09:17.339 --> 09:20.560
You... did lay them out,
though.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.606
[Charlie] Thank you.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.566
[Jared] One thing, though.
Shaming people
who are overweight,

09:26.609 --> 09:28.611
which, sorry, Shaun,
you kind of did

09:28.655 --> 09:29.873
with that
"morbidly obese" comment,

09:29.917 --> 09:31.396
can actually lead
to overeating.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.356
[Shaun] I was stating
a medical fact.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.706
Ultrasonic coagulator.
Starting the--

09:36.750 --> 09:38.360
[Charlie] But if your fact
made her feel ashamed,

09:38.403 --> 09:39.622
-then you--
-[Shaun] You inter--

09:41.406 --> 09:43.887
Charlie, you did a good job

09:43.931 --> 09:46.150
when you were not
interrupting me earlier.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.674
[Charlie] Thank you.

09:47.717 --> 09:48.892
[Shaun] But you did not
do a good job

09:48.936 --> 09:50.590
when you were interrupting me
just now.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.896
[Charlie] Oh, I just thought
we were talking
at the same time.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.203
[Shaun] But you are doing
a good job right now

09:55.246 --> 09:57.074
because you are
not interrupting--

09:57.118 --> 09:58.902
[Charlie] It's mostly
I'm completing your train
of thought, which helps.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.121
[Shaun] Okay, I am
running out of bread.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.388
[Jared] Shaun.

10:06.431 --> 10:09.043
Her liver has yellow
diffuse deposits and fibrosis.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.785
[Shaun] She has
advanced fatty liver.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.701
If this progresses,

10:14.744 --> 10:16.616
she will need
a liver transplant
or she will die.

10:22.491 --> 10:25.276
It may take a few months
to regain full mobility,

10:25.320 --> 10:27.409
but that shouldn't stop you
from walking down the aisle.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.672
Thank you so much, Doctor.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.068
So, how'd you two meet?

10:34.111 --> 10:37.506
Well, we needed some
legal work done at the school

10:37.549 --> 10:39.682
where I teach
seventh grade English,

10:39.726 --> 10:42.859
and somehow,
a big fancy litigator

10:42.903 --> 10:44.078
took us on pro bono.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.862
-Not that fancy.
-No. Fancy.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.343
And very modest.

10:48.386 --> 10:51.215
I had, uh, lost my wife,
Julie, to COVID

10:51.259 --> 10:53.391
a couple of years before and...

10:53.435 --> 10:54.871
Well, I was a mess.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.091
I certainly never thought
I could fall in love again.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.659
Neither of us
expected this to happen.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.573
But we're real glad it did.

11:01.617 --> 11:02.705
It's a beautiful story.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.883
When's the big day?

11:09.277 --> 11:11.105
Hey, are you okay?

11:11.148 --> 11:12.323
Yeah, it's just
my stomach thing.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.023
Uh, we're just
waiting for Scott

11:16.066 --> 11:18.286
to finish converting
to Judaism.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.636
I'm sure you know how long that
process can be, Dr. Wolke.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.681
You're Jewish, right?

11:22.246 --> 11:23.247
No.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.642
Oh, I-I'm sorry, I...

11:27.208 --> 11:28.209
I assumed...

11:31.865 --> 11:32.996
I feel sick.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.128
[Scott] Ronit?

11:34.171 --> 11:36.391
[retching]

11:36.434 --> 11:37.435
Ronit.

11:39.915 --> 11:41.701
-Look at me.
-Ronit!

11:42.571 --> 11:43.703
Crash cart!

11:47.881 --> 11:50.013
[Dr. Park] Stomach and duodenum
are normal.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.928
Are you ready to admit
you're wrong about them?

11:52.929 --> 11:54.757
Fine. They're in love.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.540
But why not just
peacefully live out

11:56.585 --> 11:58.413
his golden years together?

11:58.456 --> 11:59.936
Why is she making him
jump through all these hoops
to get married?

11:59.980 --> 12:01.851
Does he really want to spend
the rest of his years

12:01.895 --> 12:03.287
studying the Book of Ruth?

12:03.331 --> 12:05.028
She's not forcing him
to do anything.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.160
He wants to make her happy.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.596
Yeah, by pretending
to care about

12:07.639 --> 12:09.293
something he doesn't
actually care about.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.556
If he wants to stay married,
I also recommend pretending

12:11.600 --> 12:13.776
to care about every
other thing she cares about.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.386
Transverse colon is normal.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.040
Also, it doesn't hurt
for a man of his age

12:17.084 --> 12:19.042
to have a younger medical proxy
who cares about him.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.131
So just give her
power of attorney.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.960
Yeah, maybe in a ceremony.
She could wear white.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.657
They could exchange rings.
What's that called?

12:25.701 --> 12:27.529
Why are you
so invested in this?

12:27.572 --> 12:28.835
Why are you so cynical?

12:28.878 --> 12:30.140
Guys.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.926
Left ovary and pelvic organs.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.631
Dr. Glassman and Dr. Lim

12:42.674 --> 12:44.415
suggested
the compliment sandwich,

12:44.459 --> 12:45.808
but it is very distracting

12:45.852 --> 12:47.549
having to find two things
Charlie is doing right

12:47.592 --> 12:49.116
just so I can correct
her mistakes.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.945
There are a lot of them.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.773
What do we do in sleep training
when Steve cries?

12:55.644 --> 12:57.211
We ignore him.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.342
Ignore her.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.996
Charlie isn't a baby.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.999
When she makes mistakes,
it affects patients.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.958
How often do med students
get to do something

13:05.001 --> 13:06.046
that could actually
hurt a patient?

13:07.874 --> 13:09.266
Not very often.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.269
So, when she does something
annoying, just let it go.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.575
If you ignore the mistakes,

13:13.618 --> 13:16.273
you don't need to look
for the compliments.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.623
Well, yeah.
That is worth a try.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.408
[cell phone vibrating]

13:20.451 --> 13:22.671
Lucy's coming out
of anesthesia.

13:22.714 --> 13:23.933
I have to go.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.632
Have you forgotten something?

13:27.676 --> 13:30.026
Something to steel you against
any level of annoyingness?

13:31.332 --> 13:34.683
It smells of adorableness
and diaper cream?

13:48.566 --> 13:50.046
Now go get your ignore on.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.576
You have stage three
ovarian cancer.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.752
It's spread beyond
the ovaries and pelvis.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.454
I told my GP months ago

14:06.497 --> 14:08.064
that I was having back pain
and nausea.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.544
He said that it was
probably just stress.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.807
Unfortunately,
that's not uncommon.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.983
70% of cases are missed
at the early stages.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.424
We will do everything we can,

14:20.468 --> 14:23.645
starting with removing as many
of the tumors as possible.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.605
And hopefully
chemo can get the rest.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.708
Thanks. Perfect.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.451
-Audrey!
-Oh!

14:48.757 --> 14:50.628
-Hi.
-Hello.

14:50.672 --> 14:53.066
So, we were just talking about
where to go for dinner.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.545
[Dr. Glassman] Yeah,
what was that place?

14:54.589 --> 14:57.331
-The Chinese fusion on Elm?
-East-West.

14:58.506 --> 14:59.855
Try the wonton tacos.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.947
[sighs] Excuse me. Um...

15:04.991 --> 15:08.733
Hey, uh, I'm guessing
you're not okay with this.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.387
You sleeping with my mom?

15:10.431 --> 15:12.389
My dad did it for years.
We got along fine.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.261
Since you're
not okay with it, uh,

15:14.304 --> 15:16.741
is there anything that I can do

15:16.785 --> 15:18.395
to make this
a little bit less awkward?

15:18.439 --> 15:20.615
There's not going out with her.

15:20.658 --> 15:21.703
Short of that?

15:22.530 --> 15:23.923
You asked.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.057
[sighs]

15:39.895 --> 15:41.636
Are they?

15:41.679 --> 15:43.333
Please don't make me
think about this any more
than I already have.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.032
Ah! Wow.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.642
You've really
gotta hand it to Glassman.

15:47.685 --> 15:48.773
[sighing] I really don't.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.036
Sleeping with
your competitor's mom

15:50.079 --> 15:52.125
has got to be
the 49th Law of Power.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.909
He's not my competitor.
He's my colleague.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.045
Imagine if they got married.

16:04.441 --> 16:07.662
That's why we are recommending
gastric sleeve surgery.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.272
She's 14.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.448
[Dr. Reznick]
Lucy fits the guidelines.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.710
She has a BMI of 40,

16:12.754 --> 16:15.104
she's 136 pounds overweight,

16:15.148 --> 16:18.107
and she's having severe
medical problems as a result.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.979
Do other kids
get surgery like that?

16:20.022 --> 16:21.981
There were
1,400 bariatric surgeries

16:22.024 --> 16:23.895
performed on adolescents
in 2022,

16:23.939 --> 16:25.419
and it's becoming
more common every year.

16:25.462 --> 16:28.335
Dr. Murphy will remove
a large portion
of your stomach.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.032
That will help you to eat less.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.816
And in ways
we don't fully understand yet,

16:31.860 --> 16:33.905
it reduces the hunger signals
in your brain.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.344
That is not wrong.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.305
I want to do this.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.441
Mom, I think about food
all the time.

16:47.484 --> 16:50.096
I don't want to keep
fighting my body.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.184
I'm just so tired.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.274
Baby, I didn't...

16:54.317 --> 16:56.754
I didn't realize you were
still hurting this much.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.932
I didn't want you to know.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.587
I was trying to fight it
on my own, but...

17:03.631 --> 17:05.023
I don't think I can anymore.

17:10.637 --> 17:12.553
Uh, okay. Let's do it.

17:13.728 --> 17:14.729
Let's do it.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.517
Charlie will return with
the preoperative consent form.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.345
Responsibility.

17:22.388 --> 17:23.694
Awesome.

17:27.655 --> 17:31.006
Gunderson's doing
a robotic-assisted
thoracoscopic lobectomy.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.834
Gunderson.
Isn't he a little green?

17:32.877 --> 17:35.532
Yeah. He'll probably push
the wrong button
and start a robot rebellion.

17:35.576 --> 17:36.838
Can you assist?

17:36.881 --> 17:38.535
I could shuffle
some stuff around.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.581
Great. Problem solved.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.800
I do need you to write
that memo to the board, though.

17:43.453 --> 17:44.889
What memo?

17:44.933 --> 17:47.066
"Latest Practices in Lean
Hospital Process Management."

17:47.109 --> 17:48.719
Oh, that memo.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.417
The one you were
supposed to write.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.506
-Now that
I'm bailing Gunderson out...
-You don't have the time.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.378
Let me guess, it's due...

17:55.422 --> 17:57.206
-Tomorrow.
-What a coincidence.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.339
Now I can't take your mom
out to dinner.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.645
OR awaits.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.825
Before I have you sign this,
I need to tell you

18:07.869 --> 18:09.827
about the risks
of gastric sleeve surgery.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.612
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.266
One, acid reflux.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.572
Two, vitamin
or iron deficiency.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.052
Three, hernias.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.054
Four, internal bleeding
during surgery or afterwards.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.708
-That doesn't sound good.
-It's not.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.884
Five, surgical wound infection.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.233
Six, fatal blood clots.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.409
-Fatal?
-Yeah, like
a pulmonary embolism.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.019
Oxygen is blocked
from your lungs,

18:28.063 --> 18:29.543
and you start to suffocate.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.022
Seven, sepsis leading
to organ failure.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.676
-Wait. Hold on.
-I've changed my mind.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.852
So have I.
We're not doing this.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.119
Guess you don't need
to hear about number eight.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.257
You have put that girl's life
at risk by telling her that.

18:48.301 --> 18:49.650
I did what I was supposed to.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.521
I listed all the possible
complications.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.958
-Did you say how unlikely
each one was?
-No, but--

18:54.002 --> 18:55.699
Or explain that many were
a complication of any surgery?

18:55.743 --> 18:58.398
-I didn't think!
-Or that this was
a relatively safe surgery?

18:58.441 --> 19:00.791
-This is unfair.
-Stop interrupting me.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.315
You're interrupting me.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.491
I am the attending.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.754
I have tried complimenting you,

19:06.797 --> 19:08.321
but that didn't work.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.192
I have also tried ignoring you,
but that also didn't work.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.803
But I am required
to keep teaching you, though,

19:12.847 --> 19:14.675
so you will have to
go back to learning

19:14.718 --> 19:16.329
by observing only.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.331
You will not bother me.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.941
You will not say a word,

19:19.984 --> 19:22.291
either in surgery
or in front of the patient.

19:31.344 --> 19:32.301
You're quiet.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.087
I can't stop
thinking about Ronit.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.744
If her doctor had
only taken her seriously.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.746
Imagine trying to plan
a wedding

19:42.790 --> 19:45.227
while she's in chemo
and he's recovering
from a broken hip.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.403
Who cares about their
wedding planning?
She could die.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.449
-They care.
-Well, they shouldn't.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.190
Marriage is an outdated
institution

19:51.233 --> 19:54.193
that was invented
as a property transaction,

19:54.236 --> 19:55.933
not as an expression of love.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.283
How people feel
about it now is...

19:58.675 --> 19:59.763
That's all that matters.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.765
Well, sometimes
our feelings trap us

20:01.809 --> 20:04.507
in conventional ways
of thinking.

20:04.551 --> 20:07.510
Like, Rashi says
that most of the Israelites

20:07.554 --> 20:09.730
stayed enslaved in Egypt
because it's all they knew.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.123
Are you seriously comparing
a loving marriage to slavery?

20:12.167 --> 20:14.996
Both were invented as a means
of exchanging human chattel.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.390
That is offensive
on so many levels.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.653
And I doubt it's what Rashi,
whoever that is,

20:19.696 --> 20:21.524
meant when he wrote
that parable.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.091
It's a Midrash, not a parable.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.571
Well, you sure know a lot
about Judaism

20:24.614 --> 20:26.050
for someone who isn't Jewish.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.574
Okay, I'm not a practicing Jew,

20:27.617 --> 20:29.184
but I don't have to share
my life story with a patient.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.969
Why didn't you just say,
"I was raised Jewish,
but I don't"--

20:32.013 --> 20:33.101
[inhales sharply]

20:33.144 --> 20:34.494
Hold on.
I'll get you a bandage.

20:38.585 --> 20:39.586
Here.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.461
I don't feel like
cooking anymore.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.550
I'm going home.

20:50.988 --> 20:53.208
[door opens, closes]

20:57.386 --> 20:58.909
What are you still doing here?

20:58.953 --> 21:01.347
Aaron and I are going
out to dinner.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.696
And salsa dancing.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.001
You dance salsa?

21:05.481 --> 21:06.613
Youdance salsa?

21:06.656 --> 21:09.398
My Spanish teacher
got me into it.

21:09.442 --> 21:10.704
You have a Spanish teacher?

21:10.747 --> 21:12.314
She could actually be
a Spanish teacher.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.273
Habla muy bueno.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.231
-[Eileen] Ah, bien,actually.
-Bien,actually.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.974
So, I was doing research
for this very urgent memo,

21:20.017 --> 21:23.891
and I came upon
this great article
on Lean Practices

21:23.934 --> 21:25.980
in the Argentinian Journal
for Hospital Administration,

21:26.023 --> 21:27.373
and it was in Spanish.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.200
So I translated it for him.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.941
So she translated it for me

21:30.985 --> 21:34.336
and had some great ideas
for the memo itself

21:34.380 --> 21:37.121
and saved me hours of work.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.733
Oh, don't wait up tonight, hon.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.434
[Asher] With an open surgery,

21:45.478 --> 21:47.088
Park and I can get
more of the tumors.

21:47.131 --> 21:50.396
Laparoscopic surgery lowers
the risk of complications,

21:50.439 --> 21:52.049
which would allow her
to start chemo sooner.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.400
Ronit's pre-op labs.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.404
-Hey, Jordan.
-Hey, Jerome.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.970
How's Grandma E?

22:00.014 --> 22:01.320
Doctor said
she'll recover fine.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.930
Whether they'll recover
from me second-guessing

22:02.973 --> 22:04.671
everything they're doing
is another question.

22:04.714 --> 22:07.021
I'm glad to hear it.
On both counts.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.417
What was that?

22:13.506 --> 22:14.507
We had a fight last night.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.381
All right, this weekend,

22:19.425 --> 22:22.210
I found a box
in Jerome's drawer.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.343
I'm pretty sure
it was a ring box.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.606
Tomorrow night's
the second anniversary
of our first date.

22:27.476 --> 22:28.738
I think he's going to propose.

22:28.782 --> 22:32.263
Or I should say, was.
I don't know about now.

22:32.307 --> 22:35.266
-But isn't that
what you wanted?
-No, it is.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.530
There's just something
about the ceremony of it all,

22:37.573 --> 22:40.228
the ancient rituals,
it just feels... icky.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.273
Ancient rituals?

22:42.317 --> 22:45.233
We're talking about you
getting married,
not sacrificing a goat.

22:45.276 --> 22:48.758
I worry we'd only be doing it
because we're supposed to.

22:48.802 --> 22:52.109
In Brooklyn, my path
was laid out for me.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.853
Study the Talmud,
get married, have kids.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.160
I didn't really have a choice.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.814
What if this is the same thing?

23:01.554 --> 23:03.469
Do you love Jerome?

23:03.512 --> 23:05.993
-Absolutely.
-Then you do have a choice.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.212
You can make a life
with the man you love

23:08.256 --> 23:10.606
or find another path
without him.

23:18.571 --> 23:21.400
Bariatric surgery is conducted
hundreds of thousands

23:21.443 --> 23:23.706
of times a year
in United States hospitals.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.839
But what Ms. Lukaitis
talked about,

23:25.882 --> 23:27.667
the bleeding, the clots--

23:27.710 --> 23:29.973
Serious complications
are very rare.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.148
How rare?

23:31.192 --> 23:33.237
Based on my surgical record,

23:33.281 --> 23:35.326
site infection rate
is less than 1.5%,

23:35.370 --> 23:38.286
and I would identify it early
and treat it well.

23:38.329 --> 23:40.070
Excess bleeding
is less than 1%,

23:40.114 --> 23:42.116
and death is 1/20th of that.

23:43.683 --> 23:44.640
What do you think, Mom?

23:49.993 --> 23:51.255
I don't know.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.040
I don't want her to be ashamed.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.871
Last year...

23:57.914 --> 24:01.352
she was suicidal
because of the teasing
and the bullying.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.268
And I was too,
when I was her age.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.836
We got counseling

24:06.880 --> 24:10.710
and were really in a place
where she loved herself,

24:10.753 --> 24:12.886
and I don't want you
to lose that.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.195
I was diagnosed with ASD
when I was five years old.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.197
[Shaun] That's not relevant.
And I told you not--

24:20.241 --> 24:22.809
Shaun, I think
they want to hear
what Charlie has to say.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.469
Thank you.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.341
My brain...

24:33.384 --> 24:35.996
it doesn't process
emotional signals

24:36.039 --> 24:37.737
like other people's brains.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.000
Same with Lucy's brain
with hunger.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.090
My parents wanted
what was best for me,

24:43.133 --> 24:45.396
but my mom, she didn't want me
to feel different.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.399
So she was against me
having an in-school aid.

24:48.443 --> 24:51.533
Thought it would stigmatize me,
but my dad convinced her.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.230
They found a great aid

24:53.274 --> 24:56.973
that helped me learn
to navigate the world.

24:57.017 --> 25:00.107
This surgery won't stigmatize
your daughter.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.501
It will give her
what she needs to thrive.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.765
Everyone needs help sometimes.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.507
Let Dr. Murphy help you.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.775
Mom, please.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.170
Yeah.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.303
Okay.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.307
Good job.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.443
[Dr. Park] After
radical debulking,

25:32.487 --> 25:34.010
I don't see
any obvious gross tumor.

25:35.490 --> 25:38.406
[Asher] Assessing
abdominal organs and spleen.

25:40.843 --> 25:43.803
There are sub-centimeter
lesions on her liver.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.413
[Dr. Park] Infiltrative
hepatic metastasis.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.200
Check her diaphragm.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.686
[Asher] It's everywhere.

25:57.730 --> 26:00.471
[Dr. Park] She probably only
has a couple months, if that.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.214
Let's close.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.786
What exactly
is your motivation here?

26:10.830 --> 26:12.483
Are you trying to piss me off?

26:12.527 --> 26:14.268
Mark your territory?

26:14.311 --> 26:15.312
What are you talking about?

26:15.356 --> 26:17.706
You, dating my mom.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.882
[chuckles] You think
this is about you?

26:19.926 --> 26:21.536
It's crossed my mind.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.146
Are you out of your mind?

26:23.190 --> 26:24.713
Oh, come on. What do you
have in common with her?

26:25.279 --> 26:26.280
My mom's...

26:27.368 --> 26:28.412
She's, uh...

26:28.978 --> 26:29.979
Yes?

26:30.545 --> 26:31.546
Dull.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.244
-My mom's dull.
-No, she's not.

26:36.290 --> 26:39.467
She's a great person,
a loving mother.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.513
But she was a homemaker.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.777
Not exactly the world's
most interesting woman.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.952
[scoffs]

26:45.995 --> 26:48.345
Let me tell you something
about your mom.

26:48.389 --> 26:51.305
She learned Spanish
so she could read Don Quixote

26:51.348 --> 26:53.307
in the original. Who does that?

26:53.350 --> 26:56.092
She's seen every movie
in the Criterion Collection.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.485
That's five stars right there.

26:57.528 --> 27:00.357
She buys The New York Times
in paper form

27:00.401 --> 27:01.837
so she can do the crossword,

27:01.881 --> 27:03.839
which she does
through Saturday.

27:03.883 --> 27:05.580
I don't even
get past Wednesday.

27:07.364 --> 27:10.498
-She does?
-Yes, she does.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.369
Maybe you should get to know
your mom a little bit better.

27:12.413 --> 27:13.806
-[scoffs]
-I certainly will.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.156
Thrilled for you two.

27:16.199 --> 27:17.853
Plus, the sex is amazing.

27:27.254 --> 27:28.516
I want to marry you.

27:32.302 --> 27:34.870
It won't be
a Jewish wedding, but...

27:36.350 --> 27:38.657
der mentsh trakht un got lakht.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.227
"Man plans, God laughs."

27:49.929 --> 27:52.366
But if a Beit Din,

27:52.409 --> 27:55.064
a council of three rabbis,
approves your conversion,

27:56.936 --> 27:58.938
then there are only
a couple steps left.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.244
The big one being
a ritual bath.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.772
You can have
a Jewish wedding here.

28:09.557 --> 28:10.993
I'll set it all up for you.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.041
I was raised Hasidic.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.352
[in Hebrew] You've done this
with strength.

28:22.396 --> 28:23.397
You will be blessed.

28:35.104 --> 28:37.716
[Steve crying]

28:42.546 --> 28:44.810
[in English] I'm sorry.
I just can't take this anymore.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.681
-No. No.
-I have to rock him to sleep.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.249
No, that is the worst thing
we could do.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.251
It will teach Steve that
if he cries for ten minutes,

28:51.294 --> 28:53.732
he will get rewarded
with a hug from Mom.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.559
Steve isn't a test subject.

28:55.603 --> 28:59.738
He's our baby, and we need
to be flexible with him.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.088
He will be fine.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.524
I'm not sure I will be fine.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.918
This is so hard.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.223
And you have surgery tomorrow.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.964
Don't you need your sleep?

29:09.008 --> 29:13.882
We should focus
on how much better it will be

29:13.926 --> 29:15.971
for all three of us
in a few weeks.

29:17.625 --> 29:18.669
Okay.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.628
[crying continues]

29:27.635 --> 29:29.985
Thank you for doing this,
Rabbi Benjamin.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.727
I've adored Scott and Ronit
since I met them last year.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.163
I'd do anything for them.

29:35.643 --> 29:38.298
Now, time for some Jewish math.

29:38.341 --> 29:41.997
300 gallons is about 150 se'ah.

29:42.041 --> 29:45.044
We need 40 se'ah
of natural water

29:45.087 --> 29:48.525
and a wall between
the natural water
and tap water.

29:48.569 --> 29:51.267
And we aren't getting
rainwater in here,

29:51.311 --> 29:54.140
but Rav Kook
and the Ben Ish Chai

29:54.183 --> 29:56.403
wrote that we can use ice,

29:56.446 --> 29:57.578
so we're going to need a lot.

29:57.621 --> 30:00.363
We have a giant ice maker
on every floor.

30:00.407 --> 30:01.756
[speaking Hebrew]

30:03.889 --> 30:05.020
Where do you go to shul, Asher?

30:06.717 --> 30:08.197
Uh, I don't.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.724
Or, you know,
not since I came out.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.422
You can't be gay and Jewish?

30:15.465 --> 30:19.730
Well, aside from
the explicit prohibitions
in Vayikra 18 and 20,

30:19.774 --> 30:21.080
there's the Noahide laws

30:21.123 --> 30:23.647
and the sin of Sodom,
as explained in Sanhedrin.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.258
You should brush up
on Sanhedrin.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.999
According to the Midrash,

30:27.042 --> 30:29.044
the sin of Sodom
was cruelty toward strangers,
not homosexuality.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.089
[chuckles]

30:31.264 --> 30:32.918
Is an Orthodox rabbi telling me

30:32.961 --> 30:35.181
that the real sodomites
are the homophobes?

30:35.224 --> 30:37.618
If the Midrash fits...

30:37.661 --> 30:39.881
You are a Jew, Asher.
Whether you want to be or not.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.970
Anti-Semites
don't give you a pass

30:42.014 --> 30:44.146
because you have no mezuzah
on your door,

30:44.190 --> 30:46.018
so might as well get
something positive out of it.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.759
Respectfully, Rabbi,
I have everything
I need in my life.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.805
5,000 years of tradition,

30:50.849 --> 30:52.894
and you can't find
anything of value?

30:52.938 --> 30:54.896
The Torah isn't all or nothing.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.594
Try lighting some candles
on a Friday night.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.161
Take a little break
on a Saturday.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.902
Put some spare change in
the Tzedakah box for the poor.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.077
Read Rambam...

31:02.904 --> 31:03.862
or Philip Roth.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.302
I do love bagels.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.694
They're super carby,

31:10.738 --> 31:12.783
but I can always scoop out
the middle, right?

31:12.827 --> 31:15.221
Heresy. And yet, a start.

31:15.264 --> 31:16.222
[chuckles]

31:18.267 --> 31:19.529
Ahh.

31:19.573 --> 31:20.791

[Jared] You okay?

33:23.044 --> 33:25.220
[Shaun] I got less than
the optimal amount of sleep
last night,

33:26.308 --> 33:27.788
but I am fine to operate.

33:28.919 --> 33:32.967
[Jared] Partial stomach
is removed.

[Shaun] Heart rate's 115.
BP is 146 over 93.

33:37.754 --> 33:39.234
[Jared] Splenic infarct?

33:39.278 --> 33:41.541
[Shaun] No,
it is baseline color
and well perfused.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.282
-[Charlie] It could be
an intestinal--
-[Shaun] No, it couldn't.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.284
[Charlie] Why not?

33:45.327 --> 33:47.373
[Jared] Charlie, we don't have
time to answer your questions
right now, okay?

33:47.416 --> 33:48.417
[Charlie] That makes sense.

33:53.422 --> 33:55.946
[Shaun] Submerge the remaining
stomach in saline.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.861
Shoot air in
from the endoscope.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.733
That will tell us
what the problem is.

34:03.302 --> 34:04.694
It's a leak.

34:04.738 --> 34:06.870
We need to reinforce our
staple line with sutures and--

34:06.914 --> 34:08.089
[alarms beeping]

34:08.132 --> 34:09.830
[Jared] Heart rate 128. BP 170.

34:09.873 --> 34:12.614
[Shaun] 4-0 Vicryls,
fibrin glue.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.356
[Nurse Hawks] Get the 4-0's
from the suture cart.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.010
Why aren't they
on the back table?

34:16.054 --> 34:17.751
[Charlie] I read in The Journal
for Bariatric Surgery

34:17.793 --> 34:19.056
that they were
rarely used, so--

34:19.100 --> 34:20.406
[Shaun] You should have
asked an attending.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.538
I know she can be
quite unrelenting,

34:22.581 --> 34:23.844
but you should not make changes

34:23.887 --> 34:25.454
based on the instructions
of a medical student.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.761
-Starting sutures.
-[Charlie] It's not
her fault or mine.

34:27.804 --> 34:29.154
You have the stitches now, so--

34:29.197 --> 34:31.330
I am trying to concentrate.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.896
-Suturing.
-[Charlie] I need
to explain myself!

34:32.940 --> 34:34.637
[Shaun] Stop talking.
You're distracting me.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.378
[Charlie] I wanted
to impress you.
It's a top journal--

34:36.422 --> 34:37.813
[Shaun] Get out of the OR!

34:37.858 --> 34:39.293

35:11.413 --> 35:13.589
Lucy, we'll keep you here
for a couple of days,

35:13.633 --> 35:15.200
and then you'll be good
to go home.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.115
When will I start
to lose weight?

35:17.158 --> 35:20.770
You can expect to lose
five to fifteen pounds per week

35:20.814 --> 35:22.424
over the next few months.

35:31.564 --> 35:32.565

Going out?

35:38.527 --> 35:39.528
Maybe.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.533
I could tell that you were
uncomfortable

35:44.577 --> 35:46.666
when I saw you with Aaron.

35:46.709 --> 35:50.670
And I think I knew you were
uncomfortable even before then.

35:50.713 --> 35:54.282
But I just was having
so much fun, I...

35:55.022 --> 35:56.371
It was unfair of me.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.373
-And I think that
maybe I should just--
-Mom.

36:00.549 --> 36:01.594
It was unfair of me.

36:02.769 --> 36:03.770
Go have fun.

36:04.466 --> 36:05.815
Are you sure?

36:07.034 --> 36:08.166
Yeah.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.474
Thank you, honey.

36:18.741 --> 36:21.701
Why didn't you ever tell me
about learning Spanish

36:22.702 --> 36:26.009
or salsa dancing or anything?

36:27.315 --> 36:28.577
You never asked.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.581
I guess I never thought
there was much to hear.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.155
You and Dad...

36:41.199 --> 36:44.680
He always seemed so in charge,

36:44.724 --> 36:45.986
and you just...

36:47.640 --> 36:48.815
went along.

36:52.079 --> 36:55.430
I'm sure it did seem that way,

36:55.474 --> 36:56.910
because I knew
it was important to him.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.086
He was old school.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.305
But at its heart...

37:01.784 --> 37:03.177
it was a partnership.

37:05.353 --> 37:06.354
I didn't know.

37:08.313 --> 37:13.535
You have always been
so ambitious, driven.

37:13.579 --> 37:16.799
Is that because you didn't
want to be someone who just...

37:18.366 --> 37:19.324
went along?

37:21.804 --> 37:22.805
Maybe.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.376
Is that why
you and Clay broke up?

37:29.769 --> 37:32.162
He hasn't called
since I've been here.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.426
None of his clothes
are in the closet.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.650
He wanted to get married.

37:44.479 --> 37:45.567
And I wasn't sure.

37:47.743 --> 37:49.049
So I did my usual.

37:49.092 --> 37:52.270
I just avoided him
and I focused on work.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.143
And he took the job in Chicago.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.060
I'm so sorry.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.415
I love my job.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.158
I like who I am.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.899
I don't need
to get married again.

38:15.467 --> 38:18.731

at another hospital.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.639
I cannot work with her anymore.

39:00.468 --> 39:03.602
Well, apparently she can't
work with you, either.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.389
She filed a complaint
against you.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.144
Thanks for the ride.

an important dinner
