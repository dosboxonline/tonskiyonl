00:11.302 --> 00:13.304
[indistinct conversations]

00:16.307 --> 00:17.934
[cashier] All right, that'll be $3.40.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.145
[Mildred] Oh, okay. Let me just…

00:22.564 --> 00:25.400
[coughing]

00:31.114 --> 00:33.992
-[sighs] So sorry.
-It's okay.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.036
Here you go.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.622
[cash register beeps]

00:41.249 --> 00:42.876
And there you go.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.085
-Thank you.
-No worries.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.921
Thank you very much.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.673
-Have a good day.
-You too.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.469
[knocking on door]

00:57.599 --> 00:58.892
Have you seen my ID badge?

00:58.975 --> 01:01.227
-No.
-I had it last night,

01:01.311 --> 01:04.564
but maybe it fell out of my bag
when I paid for the pizza.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.484
This wouldn't happen if you stayed over.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.527
If you'll remember back
to when I lived here,

01:09.611 --> 01:12.614
my ability to lose things
has always been top-notch.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.908
If you stayed over,
you wouldn't have had to come

01:14.991 --> 01:16.951
all the way back here
when you realized…

01:17.035 --> 01:18.036
It's too soon, Shaun.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.496
Why?

01:20.747 --> 01:23.792
If I stayed over,
we both would've gotten a lot less sleep.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.585
Why is it too soon?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.087
Because we've only been together
a few weeks.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.007
How many weeks
of being together are required

01:31.090 --> 01:32.759
before you can stay over?

01:32.842 --> 01:33.927
Yes!

01:34.969 --> 01:36.012
Uh…

01:38.014 --> 01:39.098
Saturday.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.601
I will spend the night Saturday.

01:42.977 --> 01:43.978
[smooches]

01:51.861 --> 01:53.530
[Dr. Lim] I'm glad we come here.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.157
I don't want to stop coming.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.535
Why would we?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.203
Well, that's the way it works.

02:00.995 --> 02:01.996
You mourn, you cry,

02:02.080 --> 02:04.165
and then you forget.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.337
You don't forget.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.131
You…

02:12.382 --> 02:13.883
Start to move on.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.430
I don't want to stop coming.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.733
[thermometer beeps]

02:31.067 --> 02:32.861
Your temperature's almost 101.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.487
Your other symptoms?

02:34.571 --> 02:36.614
[hoarsely] First it was a sore throat,

02:36.698 --> 02:38.533
then my body started aching.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.826
[coughs]

02:40.451 --> 02:42.620
And then there's this cough.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.247
I even had my flu shot.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.125
Unfortunately,
influenza is constantly mutating.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.668
The shot always lags behind.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.795
Hopefully, you'll recover faster
because of it.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.380
[coughing]

02:53.381 --> 02:56.009
My daughter's very worried
that I might have this…

02:56.092 --> 02:58.303
Virus from China. What's it called?

02:58.386 --> 03:00.597
Have you been to China
or been around anyone

03:00.680 --> 03:02.098
who's been to China recently?

03:02.765 --> 03:04.392
Taken any cruises?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.936
The coronavirus
doesn't cause sore throats.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.813
-[coughing]
-This is a bad case of the flu.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.024
Go home, rest, drink plenty of fluids.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.942
You'll be fine in a week or two.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.531
[wheezing and hacking]

03:19.699 --> 03:21.618
[monitors beeping]

03:22.827 --> 03:25.121
[Dr. Lim] The virus has damaged
your mother's lungs.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.290
Her body is working harder and harder
to breathe,

03:27.373 --> 03:29.751
but her blood oxygen levels
continue to drop.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.128
She definitely has corona?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.799
We're doing everything we can to help her.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.933
[coughing and wheezing]

04:01.074 --> 04:03.326
[Shaun] You have COVID-19.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.994
But you haven't tested me.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.830
Your chest X-rays suggest
ground glass opacities.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.832
That's COVID. I don't need a test,

04:09.916 --> 04:11.626
which is good because we don't have any.

04:11.709 --> 04:12.835
But I can't smell.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.463
I've been reading about it,
and that's not a symptom.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.674
I guess it is now.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.592
You have COVID.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.262
[sighs]

04:23.221 --> 04:24.597
Okay, now what?

04:25.139 --> 04:26.975
Now you go home.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.017
That's it?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.644
That's it. There's no treatment.

04:29.727 --> 04:30.770
Stay away from people.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.064
Come back if you have
trouble breathing. Goodbye.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.109
Twenty-five tests?

04:36.192 --> 04:37.402
Per day?

04:37.860 --> 04:39.696
No, just give me one of tomorrow's.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.905
[dial tone beeping]

04:40.989 --> 04:43.074
Hello? County Health Department.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.785
I don't have time for them,
and they don't have time for me.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.120
Patient.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.371
Needs a lumpectomy.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.539
Yes. Needs. And yet.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.540
Surgery canceled?

04:50.623 --> 04:51.582
They ruled it elective.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.625
It is elective.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.960
You just said "needs."

04:54.043 --> 04:55.086
I didn't say when.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.879
This can wait till after the pandemic.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.631
[cell phone dialing]

04:58.715 --> 05:00.633
Yeah, I… I'm twice
the size of SJ General.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.593
I should have twice
the amount of tests.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.345
Well, who do I speak to?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.639
[Dr. Reznick] Do you feel
shortness of breath?

05:06.723 --> 05:07.932
A little.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.184
[device beeping]

05:10.268 --> 05:11.936
If I'm sick, is my baby sick?

05:12.020 --> 05:14.731
[Dr. Park] This disease doesn't
really seem to affect children

05:14.814 --> 05:16.607
or babies like it does adults.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.650
Should we admit her?

05:17.984 --> 05:19.902
[Dr. Reznick]
She's probably safer at home.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.363
What's at home?

05:22.447 --> 05:24.532
Do you have a support system?

05:24.615 --> 05:27.035
Can anyone come help you
in case you get worse?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.621
It's just me… And the little one.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.457
[cell phone vibrating]

05:34.542 --> 05:35.543
Get her a room.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.378
Start her on oxygen via nasal cannula,

05:37.462 --> 05:39.881
and let's try some vancomycin
and cefepime.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.758
Hey, Mia.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.093
I'm not headed back there today
or this week.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.553
I found a temporary place here.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.305
<i>There are hospitals in Phoenix, too.</i>

05:47.388 --> 05:49.432
If I come home,
do you want me living with you?

05:49.515 --> 05:50.892
<i>Of course. That's the point.</i>

05:50.975 --> 05:53.019
Every night after 12 hours
with COVID patients,

05:53.102 --> 05:54.896
to hang out with you and Kellan.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.189
And his asthma.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.776
<i>He's gonna be really bummed.</i>

06:00.568 --> 06:02.278
-<i>His graduation…</i>
-Isn't till June.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.988
This'll be over long before then.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.824
<i>Someone must have connections.</i>

06:06.908 --> 06:09.911
<i>At county? Van Kleek does, Woo does,</i>

06:09.994 --> 06:11.120
<i>Nguyen's husband works at…</i>

06:11.204 --> 06:12.497
<i>Great. Get one of them to call.</i>

06:12.580 --> 06:14.582
<i>The board of every hospital</i>
<i>has connections.</i>

06:14.665 --> 06:17.001
<i>They're all calling Public Health</i>
<i>and getting nowhere.</i>

06:17.085 --> 06:17.919
<i>So we do nothing?</i>

06:18.002 --> 06:19.754
[Dr. Glassman]
<i>No, we do everything we can.</i>

06:19.837 --> 06:23.424
<i>We hammer at official channels</i>
<i>and every manufacturer's rep</i>

06:23.508 --> 06:26.219
<i>that we deal with</i>
<i>and see what companies,</i>

06:26.302 --> 06:27.470
<i>if any, have undisturbed…</i>

06:27.553 --> 06:28.679
[Debbie] <i>Nuts or no nuts?</i>

06:30.014 --> 06:31.015
<i>Uh…</i>

06:32.266 --> 06:35.103
<i>Oh. I'm sorry. I'm…</i>
<i>I'm in the middle of, uh,</i>

06:35.186 --> 06:36.896
<i>a… a meeting with the Board.</i>

06:36.979 --> 06:38.773
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

06:38.856 --> 06:40.942
<i>I'm just making… Banana bread.</i>

06:41.025 --> 06:42.360
<i>You know what? Let's just take a…</i>

06:42.443 --> 06:43.945
I'm gonna take a quick break.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.696
If someone can get me a list of

06:45.780 --> 06:49.283
PPE suppliers in the area, thanks.
I'll be back.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.870
I don't want banana bread.
I want to be back at the hospital.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.206
I'm the president,
and I'm at home, watching.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.457
You're doing your job.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.625
Whatever you gotta do,

06:57.708 --> 06:59.544
whatever decisions you need to make,

06:59.627 --> 07:01.087
you just do it all right here.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.421
I can… [sighs]

07:02.505 --> 07:04.382
I can take the necessary precautions.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.968
That whole meeting was about
PPE's mitigation.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.011
Aaron, you are 65 years old

07:09.095 --> 07:10.346
with a history of cancer.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.266
You get that virus, then what?

07:14.475 --> 07:15.685
[sighs]

07:16.352 --> 07:17.520
I don't know what I'm doing.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.563
You're being smart.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.356
You're… You're being safe.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.732
What is wrong with that?

07:21.816 --> 07:23.776
And what is wrong with being

07:23.860 --> 07:25.862
home together for a while?

07:29.490 --> 07:30.700
Nothing, I guess.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.368
We have no choice.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.787
Let's enjoy it.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.291
Nuts or no nuts?

07:38.708 --> 07:40.960
[scoffs] Nuts.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.462
Okay.

07:45.923 --> 07:46.841
What's going on?

07:46.924 --> 07:49.427
Your mother's oxygen saturation
has gotten critically low.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.888
-We need to get her on a ventilator.
-That'll help her?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.764
It'll keep her alive,
hopefully long enough

07:53.848 --> 07:55.433
for her body to fight off the virus.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.392
Is it dangerous?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.102
More for us.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.232
[monitor beeping]

08:03.316 --> 08:04.317
[Claire] She's out.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.407
Lots of swelling.

08:21.125 --> 08:21.959
Slow.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.045
You want this over with
as soon as possible,

08:24.128 --> 08:26.172
but you also don't want her to cough.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.905
[cell phone ringing]

08:55.326 --> 08:56.702
-Hello.
-<i>Sorry. I woke you.</i>

08:56.786 --> 08:59.247
-<i>I thought you had to be up now.</i>
-[exhales sharply] I do.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.415
-I pushed snooze twice.
-<i>I read the numbers.</i>

09:01.499 --> 09:04.001
<i>You guys had seven deaths</i>
<i>in Santa Clara County yesterday.</i>

09:04.085 --> 09:05.086
<i>Any at Saint Bonaventure?</i>

09:05.169 --> 09:06.629
We have deaths at Saint Bonaventure

09:06.712 --> 09:07.880
every day, Kellan.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.173
[Lea] <i>I miss you.</i>

09:09.257 --> 09:11.008
I know. You already said that.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.593
<i>I wanted to reinforce the point.</i>

09:12.677 --> 09:14.387
You said you missed me a lot.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.222
And we're together right now.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.766
<i>It's different not being</i>
<i>actually together.</i>

09:18.849 --> 09:20.977
You mean not being able to have sex?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.855
No, I haven't been tested
because there's no need.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.148
I'm fine. No symptoms.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.276
<i>You can be asymptomatic and still have it.</i>

09:28.359 --> 09:30.528
I know. You still working out?

09:30.611 --> 09:32.780
Don't want to lose arm strength
while you're off?

09:32.863 --> 09:35.074
[Lea] <i>I'm making a salad.</i>
<i>Figured I'd bring it by</i>

09:35.157 --> 09:36.909
<i>and we'll have a masked,</i>
<i>distanced dinner.</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:38.744
You can't eat with a mask on.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.371
<i>We'll take them off when we're eating</i>

09:40.454 --> 09:41.622
<i>and turn our heads.</i>

09:41.706 --> 09:43.541
They say the regular masks don't work.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.251
<i>Okay, you can bring me one from work.</i>

09:45.334 --> 09:46.377
No.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.296
[Kellan] <i>Do you have enough PPE?</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:49.672
PPE?

09:49.755 --> 09:51.215
<i>Personal protective equipment, Dad.</i>

09:51.299 --> 09:52.800
Someone's been doing their research.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.636
Yes, we have enough.
Yes, I'm being careful.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.680
I heard your mother
joined a book club.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.599
[Kellan] <i>Is Shaun being careful?</i>

09:59.682 --> 10:01.726
Oh, yes, I am… Very.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.437
<i>So am I,</i>
<i>so it should be safe for me to come over.</i>

10:04.520 --> 10:07.106
You can't come over
because we are being safe.

10:07.189 --> 10:10.109
<i>What about apples? Do you have</i>
<i>enough apples? I could go shop for…</i>

10:10.192 --> 10:11.402
He does.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.696
See? Everything is under control.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.114
Everything's under control.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.662
[coughing]

10:21.746 --> 10:25.416
[Shaun] I told you not to come back
unless your breathing got worse.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.169
[Lily] <i>Between the fever and the cough,</i>
<i>he's barely sleeping.</i>

10:30.046 --> 10:31.047
Who said that?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.340
[sighs]

10:32.423 --> 10:35.676
My wife wanted to come with me,
but she has to work.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.303
She's essential personnel.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.847
<i>He's lost 10 pounds.</i>

10:41.182 --> 10:42.141
[Shaun] Breathe.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.101
[sighs] <i>He should've come in a week ago.</i>

10:44.185 --> 10:46.062
Please don't talk when I'm listening.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.438
[sighs]

10:48.397 --> 10:49.398
Breathe.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.525
<i>He's also coughing. A lot.</i>

10:51.609 --> 10:53.069
<i>He hasn't told you, but he is.</i>

10:53.152 --> 10:55.112
[sighs] I'm sorry.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.031
<i>Did you just apologize for me?</i>

10:57.114 --> 10:58.866
<i>Because I'm worried about you?</i>

10:59.742 --> 11:00.618
<i>So sorry.</i>

11:00.701 --> 11:02.995
<i>I'm a wife who is worried</i>
<i>about her husband.</i>

11:03.079 --> 11:04.538
<i>Forgive me, I'm… I'm evil.</i>

11:04.622 --> 11:06.832
[Shaun] It's lucky that
you're so irritating.

11:07.958 --> 11:08.793
<i>What?</i>

11:09.627 --> 11:13.047
Your husband's blood oxygen level
is dangerously low.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.092
That… That can't… That can't be.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.219
I mean, I don't… I don't feel that bad.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.012
Not great, but my breathing…

11:20.096 --> 11:24.183
That's interesting.
You don't feel bad, but you are. Hmm.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.810
Admit him o the COVID Floor.

11:25.893 --> 11:29.355
Start heated humidified
high-flow nasal cannula at 8 LPM.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.648
[coughing]

11:37.238 --> 11:39.448
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

11:51.419 --> 11:54.296
[Claire] Her CRP, ESR, ferritin, D-dimer,

11:54.380 --> 11:57.133
transaminases, and IL-6 are all way up.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.926
Try her on dexamethasone.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.678
I read in my online physicians group

12:00.761 --> 12:03.180
that the UK's had some success with that.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.808
[coughing]

12:06.267 --> 12:07.476
Thank you.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.519
Sorry, what'd you say?

12:08.602 --> 12:09.937
I couldn't hear with the mask.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.939
[coughs] Thank you.

12:12.022 --> 12:15.359
I heard you stepped in for a therapist
that didn't come in today.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.819
My son has asthma.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.821
I've been doing this kind of stuff
for years.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.657
I got a dresser.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.576
And a crib.,

12:24.285 --> 12:25.911
Bolted them both to the wall

12:27.663 --> 12:29.165
All that matters is her.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.709
I'm gonna do everything right.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.711
[chuckles]

12:33.794 --> 12:35.254
You're gonna be a parent.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.922
No way you're doing
everything right.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.094
[coughs]

12:43.804 --> 12:47.099
[Dr. Lim] Even trade… 200 surplus vials
for your COVID test kits.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.767
Well, what do you need?

12:48.851 --> 12:51.020
I've got hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin…

12:51.645 --> 12:53.022
EKG leads?

12:53.105 --> 12:54.440
No, no. I-I'm not saying no.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.858
We'll pick 'em up in two hours.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.318
We have a surplus of EKG leads?

12:57.401 --> 12:58.777
No, we've got a shortage.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.279
But that's a problem that can wait.

13:00.362 --> 13:03.574
Mildred's P-to-F is below 50.
She's showing signs of cardiogenic shock.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.326
-Start her on steroids.
-I already have.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.745
If she continues to go downhill,
I'd like to add ECMO,

13:07.828 --> 13:10.080
-take the strain off her heart and lungs.
-Good idea.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.710
I need EKG leads. What do you need?

13:14.793 --> 13:16.670
[Shaun] Should we intubate him?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.756
Not yet. Not a minute before we need to.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.966
His oxygen saturation
has been dropping steadily.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.259
It's 74 now.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.261
-[Shaun] At this rate…
-We're gonna prone him.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.888
A buddy in New York says it helps.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.056
Sometimes.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.155
How is Claire feeling?

13:45.324 --> 13:47.701
I assume she's exhausted?

13:47.785 --> 13:50.329
That isn't a feeling. How is she feeling?

13:50.412 --> 13:52.915
It's a little tough to tell, Shaun.
She's wearing a mask.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.334
Exactly. You can't tell if she's happy.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.710
You can't tell if she's sad.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.547
You can't tell if I'm sad or if I'm happy.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.382
Well, you seem distressingly happy, Shaun.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.008
It's exciting. I can't read people.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.635
Now no one can read people.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.471
We're all forced to rely
on more reliable markers…

14:07.555 --> 14:08.889
Like what people are saying.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.017
Well, since you can't tell from my face,
I'll use my words.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.143
I feel terrible.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.228
We all feel terrible

14:14.311 --> 14:15.980
because we spent the last 18 hours

14:16.063 --> 14:17.481
watching people get sicker.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.566
We didn't help anyone.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.484
We just fended off death
for a little while,

14:20.568 --> 14:23.571
and we're all disgusted at the joy
you're taking in this situation.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.823
-Give him a break.
-You're enjoying this, too.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.576
All elective surgeries
have been canceled,

14:28.659 --> 14:31.036
so no one is a surgeon anymore,
not just you.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.121
Claire…

14:33.914 --> 14:36.500
We're all exhausted,
and tomorrow won't be any different.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.795
But it'd help if we didn't hate each other
when that time comes.

14:45.801 --> 14:46.802
[sighs]

16:19.812 --> 16:22.022
[siren wailing]

16:25.442 --> 16:26.652
[elevator bell dings]

16:31.532 --> 16:32.950
You work in a hospital?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.326
Yes.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.246
Could you wait for the next elevator?

16:41.750 --> 16:42.835
I appreciate you.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.133
No.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.301
-What's wrong?
-No, no.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.429
But they had toilet paper…
12 rolls, double-ply.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.847
No, no.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.598
This is Lea's cabinet.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.476
-She's not using it now.
-It needs to stay free.

16:59.560 --> 17:03.188
For when she comes back.
This is my apartment.

17:03.272 --> 17:07.109
You had no right to put anything anywhere
without my permission.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.082
I miss Kellan and Mia, too.

17:24.668 --> 17:27.337
What do they have to do
with Lea's cabinet?

17:27.421 --> 17:28.922
You miss her, Shaun.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.133
No, I don't. If I saw Lea,

17:31.216 --> 17:34.053
she might be exposed to COVID
and she might get sick.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.472
I don't want that.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.308
And yet, you miss her.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.566
Why would I want something
that isn't what I want?

17:47.983 --> 17:50.194
Why do people on diets want ice cream?

17:54.948 --> 17:57.284
I thought the ECMO
was supposed to help her heart.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.495
It's taken some of the strain off of it,

17:59.578 --> 18:02.539
but her own immune system
is still attacking her organs.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.708
And the steroids
were supposed to stop that.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.502
We switched to a stronger medication,

18:06.585 --> 18:08.253
so hopefully that'll help.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.384
This is from her bedside table at home.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.346
I gave it to her for Mother's Day
when I was 13.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.264
Would you like me to…

18:19.348 --> 18:21.350
Please. Can I bring it to her?

18:23.519 --> 18:24.686
[sighs]

18:24.770 --> 18:27.189
I'm… I'm sorry, Lashelle, I can't.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.567
-It's just too risky.
-I don't care what happens to me.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.945
My mother is in there, all alone,

18:33.028 --> 18:34.363
hooked up to a machine.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.658
I just need to see her and… And tell her…

18:38.700 --> 18:39.910
that I love her.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.416
I can't. [sighs]

19:01.390 --> 19:02.808
[sighs deeply]

19:08.605 --> 19:10.566
[gasping]

19:10.649 --> 19:12.901
Your lungs are filling with fluid
and secretions.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.403
Suction catheter, please.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.905
<i>Is that from COVID?</i>

19:16.989 --> 19:19.950
I guess so. I don't know.
It keeps changing.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.326
Probably in combination with

19:21.410 --> 19:23.579
the bacterial pneumonia he's developed.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.747
<i>First I probably brought</i>
<i>this home to him,</i>

19:25.831 --> 19:28.000
<i>then I sent him</i>
<i>to the hospital where he's gotten…</i>

19:28.083 --> 19:29.877
Honey, don't blame yourself. I'll be fine.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.712
I need to suction out your lungs.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.839
I'm going to feed this tube up your nose

19:33.922 --> 19:35.174
and down into your airway.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.092
It will be quite uncomfortable.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.223
Please try not to grab my arm.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.977
[gasping]

19:47.060 --> 19:48.896
Take deep breaths.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.398
[breathing deeply]

19:53.901 --> 19:55.110
[door opens]

19:58.197 --> 19:59.489
We need to prone her.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.866
We can't, she's pregnant.

20:00.949 --> 20:04.369
That's why I bought this off Michelle
in PT. She does pregnancy massage.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.548
[blender whirs loudly]

20:20.010 --> 20:21.762
I'm sorry! I'm… I'm sorry!

20:21.845 --> 20:23.931
I'm on another call!
Can you hold it down?

20:24.014 --> 20:26.350
-Yeah. You can close your door.
-Okay.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.853
I-I'm making cioppino
for "Merchant Marine Night."

20:31.313 --> 20:32.481
Where did you get the clams?

20:32.564 --> 20:34.483
Oh, I ran out to Bruno's.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.193
You ran out to buy clams?

20:36.276 --> 20:38.028
Yeah, I wore… I wore a mask,

20:38.111 --> 20:40.280
and they were really good
about social distancing.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.242
I'm sorry, I'm not…
I'm not supposed to go to the hospital

20:43.325 --> 20:44.952
where I possibly could save lives

20:45.035 --> 20:46.536
but you can go to Bruno's

20:46.620 --> 20:48.789
to buy clams for "Merchant Marine Night"?

20:48.872 --> 20:50.374
I'm younger than you are,

20:50.457 --> 20:52.376
I have no history of health issues,

20:52.459 --> 20:54.753
and unlike a hospital,

20:54.836 --> 20:57.130
Bruno's is not a Petri dish of COVID.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.633
I have this whole menu planned.

20:59.716 --> 21:03.387
I thought I could wear my, um,
uniform, and you could…

21:03.470 --> 21:05.514
We're on quarantine.
We're not on a cruise.

21:05.597 --> 21:09.393
I know, but I thought since we're stuck
at home, we could have some fun.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.852
It's not a party, it's a pandemic.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.521
I don't have time for theme dinners

21:12.604 --> 21:15.023
and elaborate menus
and sourdough starter.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.569
Okay.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.865
We could…
We could at least dress up for dinner?

21:25.492 --> 21:26.493
Yeah…

21:58.025 --> 22:01.028
Do you think it helps Martin

22:03.822 --> 22:05.324
<i>Yeah. Yes.</i>

22:16.668 --> 22:18.003
Martin has a heart murmur.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.213
-<i>What?</i>
-Martin! Martin!

22:21.006 --> 22:22.632
Hello. I'm glad you're awake.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.427
You may have a bacterial abscess
on your heart valve.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.095
-That sounds really bad.
-It is.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.890
COVID's complications
are not at all consistent.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.516
It's becoming annoying.

I'll tell you more
on the way to the procedure.

I read about a small clinical
rescue therapy trial… The CHILL study.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.891
She's a good candidate…
No cytokine storm,

37:48.975 --> 37:51.477
her troponin's low,
so are her LFTs and creatinine.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.728
Her organs are in good shape.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.438
So why not freeze them and paralyze

37:54.522 --> 37:56.357
virtually every muscle in her body?

37:56.440 --> 37:58.276
Lowering the temperature reduces her

37:58.359 --> 38:01.487
inflammatory response
and her need for oxygen.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.823
And it's better
than calling her next of kin.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.950
She's gonna require constant monitoring.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.535
We're all already overstretched.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.911
I'll do it.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.913
I'll take full responsibility for her.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.129
[knocking on door]

38:20.006 --> 38:20.923
Who's there?

38:21.007 --> 38:22.383
[Lea] It's Lea.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.511
-You can't come in.
-I got you something.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.931
That's too bad.
You can't come in to give it to me.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.433
[paper rustling]

38:44.739 --> 38:47.116
I saw online doctors are using these

38:47.199 --> 38:48.701
to help with their masks.

38:48.784 --> 38:51.287
You attach an elastic to each arm

38:51.370 --> 38:53.205
so they don't rub your ears.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.136
[Shaun] It is better.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.763
Thank you.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.057
[exhales sharply]

39:11.140 --> 39:17.355
I know I can't come in,
but I don't want to leave.

39:25.571 --> 39:27.073
You can stay there.

What's for breakfast tomorrow?

39:44.548 --> 39:46.592
Park's making pancakes.

39:46.675 --> 39:49.095
Mm. That's great.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.430
He's done it before.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.641
They weren't very good.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.559
[chuckles] Why?

39:57.311 --> 39:59.397
They… They were not very good.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.108
I… I don't know, but I told him, I said,

pancakes are…"

Oh, since you feel that our time together

41:10.843 --> 41:14.180
is something to be endured
instead of enjoyed,

41:14.263 --> 41:17.433
I decided to make that easier for you.
