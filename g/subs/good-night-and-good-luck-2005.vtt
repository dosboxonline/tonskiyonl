02:34.245 --> 02:38.124
In 1935, Ed Murrow
began his career with CBS.

02:38.916 --> 02:40.585
When World War Two broke out...

02:40.668 --> 02:43.462
...his voice brought
the battle of Britain home to us...

02:43.546 --> 02:46.007
...through his "This Is London"
radio series.

02:46.924 --> 02:48.467
He started with us all...

02:48.593 --> 02:52.013
...many of us here tonight,
when television was in its infancy...

02:52.096 --> 02:54.557
...with the news documentary show,
"See It Now".

02:54.724 --> 02:56.475
He threw stones at giants.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.813
Segregation, exploitation
of migrant workers...

03:01.022 --> 03:03.107
...apartheid, J. Edgar Hoover...

03:03.983 --> 03:08.112
...not the least of which, his historical
fight with Senator McCarthy.

03:09.238 --> 03:12.867
He is the host of our enormously
popular show "Person to Person"...

03:13.576 --> 03:16.370
...and tonight he is here
with his son, Casey...

03:16.829 --> 03:20.165
...wife, Janet, and all of you
who he's worked with...

03:20.499 --> 03:23.586
...inspired, lectured, and taught.

03:24.712 --> 03:26.046
Ladies and gentlemen...

03:26.130 --> 03:30.301
...the Radio-Television News Directors'
Association and Foundation welcomes...

03:30.384 --> 03:32.636
...Mr. Edward R. Murrow.

03:53.282 --> 03:55.450
This might just do nobody any good.

03:56.326 --> 04:00.080
At the end of this discourse
a few people may accuse this reporter...

04:00.163 --> 04:02.374
...of fouling
his own comfortable nest...

04:02.791 --> 04:06.336
...and your organization may be
accused of having given hospitality...

04:06.420 --> 04:08.797
...to heretical
and even dangerous ideas.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.134
But the elaborate structure
of networks...

04:12.217 --> 04:16.053
...advertising agencies, and sponsors
will not be shaken or altered.

04:16.930 --> 04:20.350
It is my desire, if not my duty,
to try to talk to you journeymen...

04:20.434 --> 04:23.979
...with some candor about what
is happening to radio and television.

04:24.062 --> 04:26.022
And if what I say is responsible...

04:26.439 --> 04:29.025
...I alone am responsible
for the saying of it.

04:30.235 --> 04:32.404
Our history will be
what we make of it.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.866
And if there are any historians
about 50 or 100 years from now...

04:36.950 --> 04:38.577
...and there should be preserved...

04:38.660 --> 04:41.496
...the kinescopes of one week
of all three networks...

04:41.913 --> 04:45.583
...they will there find recorded
in black and white, and in color...

04:46.167 --> 04:48.211
...evidence of decadence,
escapism...

04:48.294 --> 04:51.923
...and insulation from the realities
of the world in which we live.

04:52.465 --> 04:56.261
We are currently wealthy, fat,
comfortable, and complacent.

04:57.137 --> 05:00.807
We have a built-in allergy to
unpleasant or disturbing information.

05:01.015 --> 05:03.226
Our mass media reflect this.

05:04.227 --> 05:06.604
But unless we get up off
our fat surpluses...

05:06.688 --> 05:09.148
...and recognize
that television in the main...

05:09.232 --> 05:13.444
...is being used to distract, delude,
amuse, and insulate us...

05:13.945 --> 05:16.239
...then television
and those who finance it...

05:16.322 --> 05:19.242
...those who look at it
and those who work at it...

05:19.575 --> 05:22.161
...may see a totally
different picture too late.

06:09.125 --> 06:12.336
Millie! Just the person
I wanted to see! Come here!

06:22.137 --> 06:24.306
This goes at the top
of the Roy Campanella piece.

06:24.390 --> 06:25.516
Yes! Give me a half an hour.

06:25.599 --> 06:27.434
I may need it
a little quicker than that!

06:27.518 --> 06:30.646
- Can I get some coffee first?
- Come on! Get me some coffee!

06:32.731 --> 06:33.899
Morning, Johnny!

06:33.983 --> 06:37.111
I have some new notes that go
with the Tito footage for Fred.

06:37.194 --> 06:38.445
Fred's gonna be in
in an hour.

06:38.529 --> 06:41.740
I already put them on his desk.
Can you just make sure that...

06:41.824 --> 06:44.618
...he doesn't look at the film
until he reads the notes?

06:44.702 --> 06:46.036
- Yes.
- Thank you.

06:46.370 --> 06:47.413
Hey, Joe! Shirley!

06:48.956 --> 06:51.333
- What's going on in here?
- What do you mean?

06:51.417 --> 06:53.335
Two attractive people
alone in the copy room!

06:53.418 --> 06:54.711
Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me.

06:54.795 --> 06:56.296
He'll fire both of us, Shirley.

06:56.380 --> 06:59.174
- Rules are made to be broken!
- You can afford to say that.

07:03.804 --> 07:05.055
Let me see this.

07:08.684 --> 07:12.312
- It's simply a loyalty oath.
- To CBS? - And to America.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.064
You promise to be a loyal American?

07:14.147 --> 07:16.316
I know. All of the reporters
have signed this.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.110
Who are you promising this to?
CBS?

07:18.193 --> 07:20.195
Fred signed it.
Murrow signed it.

07:20.278 --> 07:21.655
- Murrow signed it?
- Yeah.

07:23.115 --> 07:24.866
Are you now
or have you ever been...

07:24.950 --> 07:27.202
I thought it was a joke,
but there's a lot of pressure.

07:27.285 --> 07:29.830
...on the Attorney General's list
of subversive groups?

07:29.913 --> 07:32.124
- I don't know.
- Let's think about it.

07:32.207 --> 07:35.794
What is it really saying? Is it a civil
liberties issue or censorship?

07:35.877 --> 07:38.213
Am I simply stating to CBS
that I'm not a Communist?

07:38.296 --> 07:40.632
- Murrow signed this?
- And Fred and Stanton.

07:40.715 --> 07:43.885
- Maybe you should talk to Murrow.
- Maybe I should sign it.

07:45.053 --> 07:47.847
If you don't sign this,
are you and I a target?

07:50.141 --> 07:52.102
If I don't sign it,
they'll fire me.

07:58.566 --> 07:59.567
Sign it.

07:59.984 --> 08:02.153
Finally we can tell everyone
the truth.

08:03.446 --> 08:06.866
If I could express it
in what's in my heart now...

08:07.242 --> 08:11.621
...I'd do it in the terms
of the poet who once said...

08:12.205 --> 08:15.583
..."Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower
I bring to you."

08:16.584 --> 08:18.628
"Yes, 'tis but a violet..."

08:19.587 --> 08:21.089
"...glistening with dew."

08:22.090 --> 08:25.635
"But still in its heart
there lie beauties concealed."

08:26.719 --> 08:28.388
"So in our heart..."

08:29.806 --> 08:31.391
"...our love for you..."

08:32.392 --> 08:34.977
"...lies unrevealed."

08:37.480 --> 08:38.606
I used to...

08:44.779 --> 08:49.784
...pride myself on the idea
that I was a bit... tough...

08:51.577 --> 08:57.792
...especially over the past
18-19 months, when we've been...

08:58.417 --> 09:01.462
...kicked around,
and bullwhipped, and damned.

09:02.755 --> 09:04.090
I didn't think that...

09:06.384 --> 09:09.387
...I could be... touched very deeply.

09:09.595 --> 09:11.847
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough, Leo.

09:11.931 --> 09:13.974
- It's short.
- How long is the piece?

09:14.058 --> 09:15.810
It's 4 minutes,
but we can cut it down.

09:15.893 --> 09:18.687
It can't stand alone, but it might be
a nice companion piece.

09:18.771 --> 09:21.107
Let's go through this one more time.
Palmer!

09:21.190 --> 09:24.527
Yep, got a call from the office
of Senator Morse this morning...

09:24.610 --> 09:27.738
...interested in setting up
a debate possibly with Senator Kerr...

09:27.822 --> 09:30.282
...over the comments
Bentsen made on last night's show.

09:30.366 --> 09:33.619
Secretary of Agriculture? Good idea!
Can they do it by this week?

09:33.702 --> 09:36.288
No, it would have to be 2 weeks
at the earliest...

09:36.372 --> 09:39.708
...depending on Morse's schedule.
But still it's a great idea.

09:39.792 --> 09:43.128
Let's follow up on that.
"Hoover speaks on Benjamin Franklin."

09:43.212 --> 09:46.340
We're having better luck
with Mr. Benjamin Franklin...

09:46.423 --> 09:47.675
...than with Mr. Hoover.

09:47.758 --> 09:50.219
It may progress better
as a "Person to Person".

09:50.302 --> 09:52.763
"At home with Ben Franklin.
His electricity awards."

09:52.846 --> 09:54.765
We've got the footage,
we need to contact him.

09:54.848 --> 09:58.560
See if you can contact him and get the
shot. He wants to do the story. Joe!

09:58.644 --> 10:00.395
Member Delbert Clark?
No longer with us.

10:00.479 --> 10:03.023
- New York Times? - Yeah.
- Our friend at the Times.

10:03.106 --> 10:05.817
This was yesterday morning,
they're saying it's...

10:06.026 --> 10:09.613
- How old was he?
- 53. Sudden illness.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.366
- Home of a friend.
- No, it's not an obit piece.

10:12.532 --> 10:15.077
Natalie send some flowers
over there from us.

10:15.535 --> 10:17.871
Couple things.
Case before the Supreme Court...

10:17.955 --> 10:21.875
...involving the constitutionality of a
section of the Internal Security Act...

10:21.958 --> 10:23.919
...provides for the deportation
of any alien...

10:24.002 --> 10:26.755
...if he becomes a Communist
after entering this country.

10:27.297 --> 10:28.382
Can you take this?

10:28.465 --> 10:31.051
All right. McCarthy interrupting
his wedding trip...

10:31.134 --> 10:34.638
...to take charge of the investigation
of Communist infiltration...

10:34.721 --> 10:37.140
- Natalie, send some flowers.
- Poor Mrs. McCarthy!

10:37.224 --> 10:39.351
May I finish?
It's national security!

10:39.434 --> 10:42.229
- A real ladies' man!
- Well, they're in love.

10:42.729 --> 10:47.108
We have no show for Tuesday, fellows.
So get out there and make some news.

10:47.943 --> 10:51.279
Rob a bank. Mug an old lady.
Do something.

10:52.072 --> 10:54.699
- You look at the Secretary Stevens
footage? - We will.

10:54.783 --> 10:57.327
Watch it all the way to the end,
it's worth it.

10:58.912 --> 11:00.121
Thank you, John.

11:01.039 --> 11:02.415
There's not much there.

11:02.540 --> 11:06.044
I can't tie it to the Eisenhower
in the back of the train piece.

11:06.336 --> 11:09.714
- You ever spend any time in Detroit,
Fred? - Not recently.

11:11.091 --> 11:14.344
There's a story here
in the Detroit News, Dexter, Michigan.

11:15.094 --> 11:17.180
A kid named Milo Radulovich.

11:18.765 --> 11:22.519
- Italian? - Irish. Air Force
kicked him out because his dad...

11:22.602 --> 11:27.232
...read some Serbian newspaper.
- Was he a Communist? - I don't know.

11:27.315 --> 11:29.150
- Who brought the charges?
- Air Force.

11:29.943 --> 11:32.570
Charges were in a sealed envelope,
nobody saw them.

11:32.654 --> 11:35.948
- Not even at the hearing? - He was
declared guilty without a trial...

11:36.032 --> 11:37.784
...and told if he wanted
to keep his job...

11:37.867 --> 11:41.162
...he had to denounce his father
and his sister. Thank you, Natalie.

11:41.245 --> 11:43.706
- His sister?
- He told them to take a hike.

11:45.416 --> 11:49.087
Let's send Joe and Charlie down there,
see if he's any good on camera.

11:49.170 --> 11:51.464
Is he being brought
before the Committee?

11:52.173 --> 11:53.174
No.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.676
Then it's not McCarthy.

11:57.303 --> 11:58.304
Isn't it?

12:04.393 --> 12:05.937
Milo Radulovich.

12:10.191 --> 12:11.609
What happens to your children...

12:11.692 --> 12:14.612
...your 5-year-old and your 5-month-old
in terms of you?

12:14.695 --> 12:17.656
If I am being judged
on my relatives...

12:18.657 --> 12:23.746
...are my children going
to be asked to denounce me?

12:23.829 --> 12:27.875
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

12:28.584 --> 12:33.589
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

12:33.672 --> 12:36.008
...why their father
is a security risk?

12:36.967 --> 12:41.639
If the thing is let stand
as it, the first recommendation...

12:41.931 --> 12:46.143
...was sent out by the board,
I see a chain reaction that...

12:46.935 --> 12:49.229
...has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

12:55.903 --> 12:57.237
Well, that's new.

12:58.447 --> 13:00.074
You can't call this
a neutral piece.

13:00.157 --> 13:03.452
The other side's been represented
rather well for the last 2 years.

13:03.535 --> 13:05.120
The Air Force
hasn't gone on the record.

13:05.204 --> 13:08.248
So you want to forego the standards
you've stuck to for 15 years...

13:08.332 --> 13:09.583
...both sides, no commentary.

13:09.666 --> 13:12.669
- We all editorialize. - I'm just
making sure we identify what...

13:12.753 --> 13:14.421
We're giving them
the information up front...

13:14.504 --> 13:16.089
...and we're asking them
to comment on it.

13:16.173 --> 13:17.216
Frank, hold on.

13:17.966 --> 13:19.635
I've searched my conscience.

13:19.801 --> 13:23.013
I can't for the life of me
find any justification for this.

13:23.096 --> 13:25.974
I simply cannot accept
that there are, on every story...

13:26.058 --> 13:28.101
...two equal and logical sides
to an argument.

13:28.185 --> 13:31.146
- Call it editorializing, if you'd like.
- It is editorializing.

13:31.229 --> 13:32.939
They'll have equal time
to defend themselves.

13:33.023 --> 13:35.108
Do you understand the position
you're putting us in?

13:35.192 --> 13:38.153
We are all in this together,
if the Senate wants to investigate...

13:38.236 --> 13:39.279
Do me a favor...

13:39.362 --> 13:42.699
...avoid any big speeches about how
we're all in a big boat together!

13:42.783 --> 13:43.992
Please, don't insult me.

13:44.534 --> 13:48.663
I have to go back to Mr. Paley
and Alcoa, who sponsors your show...

13:49.164 --> 13:51.499
...and also have
some military contracts...

13:51.583 --> 13:54.794
...and I have to tell them that
they're going to be in a tough bind...

13:54.878 --> 13:56.922
...because of a beef you had
with Joe McCarthy.

13:57.005 --> 14:00.133
- We're not going at McCarthy.
- You're starting the goddamn fire.

14:00.216 --> 14:03.595
Excuse me. Mr. Friendly,
there's a Colonel Anderson to see you?

14:03.678 --> 14:07.182
- Colonel? - He's in your office.
There are two of them.

14:08.975 --> 14:12.228
Maybe they liked the transcript,
and want to compliment us on it.

14:12.812 --> 14:13.855
Excuse me.

14:22.030 --> 14:24.782
Go after Joe Kennedy.
We'll pay for it.

14:25.283 --> 14:27.368
I've got a great story about Hoover.

14:31.331 --> 14:33.791
You know how many shows
you're going to have to do...

14:33.875 --> 14:36.961
...to make up for this? - And Judy
and her daughter Liza next week.

14:37.045 --> 14:39.130
No, no.
You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin!

14:44.218 --> 14:45.762
I'll talk to Mr. Paley.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.183
Alcoa won't pay for the ads.

14:51.184 --> 14:54.854
And we probably won't either.
But nobody'll stop you.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.105
How much are the ads?

14:58.357 --> 15:01.527
- 3,000.
- I'll split it with Fred.

15:03.112 --> 15:06.449
He just won't have Christmas presents
for his kids this year.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.994
- He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that,
he loves Christmas.

15:19.170 --> 15:22.173
- To be clear, you did speak
with the lawyers? - Yes, we did.

15:22.256 --> 15:25.551
And we read the transcript. We've not
been allowed to see the footage.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.679
Mack is on a plane from Dexter
right now with the last interviews.

15:28.763 --> 15:30.514
We'll be going
right down to the wire.

15:30.598 --> 15:35.269
Your show airs tomorrow. How can we
possibly approve and check...

15:35.352 --> 15:39.064
...your story in the limited amount
of time you have given us?

15:39.148 --> 15:42.860
With all due respect, you have been
invited to participate in this piece...

15:42.943 --> 15:44.320
...not to approve it.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.990
We are going with the story
that says that the U.S. Air Force...

15:48.073 --> 15:50.618
...tried Milo Radulovich
without any evidence...

15:50.701 --> 15:53.287
...and found him guilty
of being a security risk...

15:53.370 --> 15:57.041
...without his Constitutional rights...
- You have not seen the evidence...

15:57.124 --> 15:59.460
...and are claiming
he's not a security risk.

15:59.543 --> 16:03.672
Wouldn't you guess that those who have
seen the contents of that envelope...

16:03.756 --> 16:07.801
...might have a better idea of what
makes someone a danger to his country?

16:07.885 --> 16:11.221
- Who? Who? - Or do you think
it should just be you that decides?

16:11.305 --> 16:13.891
Who are the people?
Are they elected? Are they appointed?

16:13.974 --> 16:16.643
Do they have an axe to grind?
Is it you, sir?

16:16.894 --> 16:21.148
Or you, Colonel Jenkins? Do you know
the contents of that sealed envelope?

16:22.149 --> 16:27.696
We have been a friend and ally of both
Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.575
The story you are going
to run tomorrow is without merit.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.203
So before you take any steps
that cannot be undone...

16:35.579 --> 16:38.248
...I strongly urge you
to reconsider your stand.

16:38.915 --> 16:42.377
These are very dangerous waters
you are attempting to navigate.

16:48.467 --> 16:54.347
We have had no hearing at all.
We have had no day in court.

16:54.764 --> 16:58.894
In all the 32 years that I have been
a practicing attorney in Detroit...

16:59.102 --> 17:03.648
...I have never witnessed such a farce
and travesty upon justice...

17:03.732 --> 17:05.733
...as this thing has developed.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.819
- Now this whole theory...
- Eddie, just take the first reel.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.864
Tell John I left
5 seconds extra leader.

17:10.946 --> 17:14.325
5 seconds! I got it! Palmer,
where's Joe? Have you seen Joe?

17:14.409 --> 17:15.702
He's on his way
to the control room.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.454
We're gonna have to do
the voice-over live.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.329
Natalie, I need a booth
with a live mic.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.665
Booth is there, it's already set.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.959
We didn't have time
to sync the voice-over out.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.877
That's not what I asked for.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.506
It's missing the voice-over
on the last piece.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.717
There's a commercial in the booth.
What shall I do?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.553
- 2 minutes to air! - There's not
supposed to be a commercial!

17:33.636 --> 17:34.929
Get him out of the booth!

17:38.474 --> 17:40.685
2-and-a-half minutes
on the end piece.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.564
Keep it down, please.
It's a little loud.

17:44.689 --> 17:45.982
2 minutes to air, fellas.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.737
- He's gonna add a joke.
- Charlie, loan me your lighter.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.950
Make sure you know that I swap
with those two pieces of parents.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.036
- As long as he talks fast because...
- He will talk fast.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.334
We got the film.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.795
Will it be ready?

18:08.296 --> 18:09.338
You bet.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.554
Funny thing, Freddy!

18:17.013 --> 18:20.308
Every time you light a cigarette
for me, I know you're lying.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.825
It occurs to me
we might not get away with this one.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.251
Alcoa, the aluminum company
of America...

18:47.334 --> 18:49.503
- 10 seconds.
- You fellas, ready? Okay.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.046
Ready on camera 1.

18:58.012 --> 19:02.308
5, 4, 3, 2.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.437
Pan, camera 1.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.981
Good evening.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.110
A few weeks ago there occurred a few
obscure notices in the newspapers...

19:13.193 --> 19:14.987
...about Milo Radulovich...

19:15.362 --> 19:17.573
...a lieutenant
in the Air Force Reserves.

19:17.906 --> 19:21.577
And, also, something about Air Force
regulation 35-62...

19:22.452 --> 19:26.039
...which states that a man
may be regarded as a security risk...

19:26.123 --> 19:29.376
...if he has close and continuing
association with Communists...

19:29.459 --> 19:32.170
...or people believed
to have Communist sympathies.

19:33.088 --> 19:36.633
Lieutenant Radulovich was asked
to resign in August. He declined.

19:36.883 --> 19:39.094
A board was called
and heard his case.

19:39.177 --> 19:42.806
At the end it was recommended that
he be severed from the Air Force...

19:42.889 --> 19:46.309
...although it was also stated
that there was no question whatever...

19:46.393 --> 19:48.228
...as to the Lieutenant's loyalty.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.772
We propose to examine,
in so far as we can...

19:50.856 --> 19:52.983
...the case of Lieutenant Radulovich.

19:53.191 --> 19:55.986
Our reporter, Joe Wershba,
cameraman, Charlie Mack.

19:56.903 --> 19:59.906
This is the town of Dexter, Michigan.
Population 1500.

20:00.323 --> 20:03.618
This statue is at the end
of Ann Arbor Street erected by...

20:03.702 --> 20:05.662
What did the General
tell you yesterday?

20:05.829 --> 20:09.082
- A Colonel. There were two of them.
- That makes a General.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.583
They weren't too pleased.

20:11.459 --> 20:13.420
You're gonna get audited this year.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.965
Not me, you. I told them
I didn't want to do the story.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.885
- You always were yellow.
- Better than red.

20:28.017 --> 20:29.144
In 10 seconds.

20:33.606 --> 20:36.234
This is the sister,
Margaret Radulovich Fishman.

20:36.609 --> 20:39.779
She neither defends nor explains
her political activities.

20:39.988 --> 20:44.784
I feel that my activities,
be what they may...

20:44.867 --> 20:47.829
...or my political beliefs
are my own private affair.

20:48.329 --> 20:53.501
Are my children going to be asked
to denounce me?

20:53.584 --> 20:57.714
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

20:58.172 --> 21:03.094
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

21:03.219 --> 21:05.263
...why their father
is a security risk?

21:06.180 --> 21:11.102
I see, absolutely,
that this is a chain reaction.

21:11.477 --> 21:15.773
If the thing is let stand as it,
the first recommendation...

21:15.857 --> 21:20.152
...was sent out by the board
I see a chain reaction...

21:20.236 --> 21:23.698
...that has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

21:24.573 --> 21:27.660
Perhaps you will permit me
to read a few sentences...

21:27.743 --> 21:30.871
...because I would like to say
rather precisely what I mean.

21:31.288 --> 21:34.041
We have told the Air Force
that we will provide facilities...

21:34.125 --> 21:37.211
...for any comments, criticisms,
or corrections it may wish to make...

21:37.294 --> 21:39.296
...as to the case of Milo Radulovich.

21:40.589 --> 21:44.093
We are unable to judge the charges
against his father or sister...

21:44.176 --> 21:47.513
...because neither we, nor you,
nor they, nor the lawyers...

21:47.596 --> 21:51.642
...nor the Lieutenant, know what was
contained in that manila envelope.

21:52.351 --> 21:55.521
Was it hearsay,
rumor, gossip, slander...

21:55.771 --> 21:59.817
...or hard ascertainable facts that
could be backed by credible witnesses?

22:00.150 --> 22:01.360
We do not know.

22:02.194 --> 22:05.489
We believe the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father.

22:05.614 --> 22:09.118
Even though that iniquity be proved
and in this case it was not.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.455
But we believe too that this case
illustrates the urgent need...

22:13.539 --> 22:17.459
...for the Armed Forces to communicate
more fully than they have so far done...

22:17.543 --> 22:20.003
...the procedures and regulations
to be followed...

22:20.087 --> 22:22.506
...in attempting to protect
the national security...

22:22.589 --> 22:25.342
...and the rights of the individual
at the same time.

22:26.426 --> 22:29.137
Whatever happens in this area
of the relationship...

22:29.221 --> 22:31.348
...between the individual
and the state...

22:31.431 --> 22:33.016
...we will do it ourselves...

22:33.559 --> 22:38.021
...it cannot be blamed on Malenkov
or Mao Tse-Tung or even our allies.

22:38.772 --> 22:42.109
And, it seems to us,
Fred Friendly and myself...

22:42.609 --> 22:46.113
...that this is a subject
that should be argued about endlessly.

22:47.698 --> 22:49.574
Good night, and good luck.

22:56.456 --> 22:57.624
And we're out.

24:33.511 --> 24:34.553
May I tell you something
about yourself...

24:34.595 --> 24:35.638
May I tell you something
about yourself...

24:35.721 --> 24:38.140
...as a member
of the "Person to Person" audience?

24:38.224 --> 24:40.309
Based on audience
research studies...

24:40.851 --> 24:44.438
...you are well above average
in education and intelligence.

24:45.022 --> 24:48.192
Your interests are wide,
from world affairs and science...

24:48.359 --> 24:50.194
...to sports and show business.

24:50.486 --> 24:53.739
And you have one characteristic
that's rather encouraging to me...

24:53.823 --> 24:57.743
...and that's the fact that you are
not easily persuaded by advertising.

24:58.494 --> 25:01.330
The makers of Kent considered
all these characteristics...

25:01.413 --> 25:03.582
...when they chose
Mr. Murrow's program...

25:03.666 --> 25:05.209
...to tell you about Kent.

25:05.459 --> 25:10.547
Of all leading filter cigarettes,
Kent filters best.

25:10.798 --> 25:13.926
If you try Kent with that in mind,
I think you'll agree...

25:14.009 --> 25:17.221
...with many other thinking people
who have changed to Kent.

25:17.554 --> 25:22.476
They find that it makes good sense
to smoke Kent and good smoking, too.

25:23.435 --> 25:26.730
- Did you get the changes?
- Edward Murrow, "Person to Person"...

25:26.814 --> 25:30.651
...on the CBS Television Network.
- No, no. You there? Okay. We got it.

25:30.734 --> 25:32.319
Now back to Ed Murrow.

25:33.570 --> 25:36.490
Not since the silent movies
and the idols they produced...

25:36.573 --> 25:40.327
...has Hollywood witnessed the sort
of pilgrimage that is now going on.

25:40.827 --> 25:44.498
Each day, oblivious to time,
weather, and the state of the world...

25:44.665 --> 25:48.502
...sightseers head in the direction
of California's San Fernando Valley.

25:48.961 --> 25:52.214
For there, at the end
of the tourist line, is Sherman Oaks...

25:52.297 --> 25:55.634
...and the home Liberace
has built for himself and his mother.

25:55.801 --> 25:59.679
This is the front and nobody knows
how many people have seen that view.

26:00.305 --> 26:03.558
This is the back of the house
and that's Liberace's bedroom.

26:04.559 --> 26:06.728
- Good evening, Lee.
- Good evening, Ed.

26:06.812 --> 26:11.566
- What are you doing? - I'm dictating
my weekly syndicated newspaper column...

26:12.025 --> 26:18.573
...and on my trusty tape recorder here,
I'm also dictating a book.

26:18.657 --> 26:21.034
- It's an inspirational book.
- Lee, what about you?

26:21.117 --> 26:24.120
Have you given much thought
to getting married and settling down?

26:24.204 --> 26:26.831
Actually, I've given
a lot of thought to it...

26:26.915 --> 26:30.835
...but I don't believe in getting married
just for the sake of getting married.

26:30.919 --> 26:33.630
I want to some day
find the perfect mate...

26:34.005 --> 26:38.093
...and settle down to what I hope will
be a marriage that will be blessed...

26:38.218 --> 26:40.845
...by faith
and will be a lasting union.

26:41.346 --> 26:46.100
I was reading
about lovely young Princess Margaret...

26:46.643 --> 26:49.312
...and she's looking
for her dream man, too...

26:49.896 --> 26:51.898
...and I hope she finds him some day.

26:53.274 --> 26:57.028
Uh-huh. Lee, thanks very much
for letting us come and visit you.

26:57.111 --> 26:58.279
It's been very pleasant.

26:58.363 --> 27:00.531
And will you say good night
to your family for us?

27:00.615 --> 27:02.325
- I certainly will.
- Thanks a lot.

27:02.408 --> 27:04.243
- Good night, Ed.
- Good night, Lee.

27:05.703 --> 27:08.456
Next week, we'll take you
to Beverly Hills, California...

27:08.539 --> 27:11.209
...to the house of Mickey Rooney
and his new bride.

27:11.292 --> 27:13.961
Until then,
good night, and good luck.

27:20.176 --> 27:21.803
Good show, Mr. Murrow!

27:44.992 --> 27:46.243
Excuse me, Mr. Murrow.

27:46.327 --> 27:49.038
Could you take a look at this
and sign it for me, please?

27:49.121 --> 27:52.249
Thank you. Dr. Stanton
would like to have a drink with you.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.376
- When?
- Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.670
I can't. What the hell
is he doing there?

27:56.754 --> 27:59.632
- I believe he's waiting for you.
- Just call him! - Fine.

27:59.715 --> 28:02.384
- Oppenheimer next week.
- It's a good show, Ed.

28:04.220 --> 28:05.554
- Hey, Don!
- Ed!

28:06.597 --> 28:08.015
You're getting good at this!

28:08.557 --> 28:10.351
They're gonna think you like it!

28:10.517 --> 28:12.811
Pays the bills. How are you, Don?

28:14.104 --> 28:15.147
Ah, it's...

28:16.607 --> 28:17.816
...day to day.

28:18.567 --> 28:21.487
If she saw how good you look
right now, she'd be back.

28:23.030 --> 28:25.449
You tell her that
if you see her, will you?

28:26.950 --> 28:30.162
- I read the O'Brian piece.
- Yeah, it's tough.

28:30.996 --> 28:33.582
I'm a pinko.
I slant the news.

28:34.666 --> 28:37.503
I'm just waiting for him
to say my wife left me too.

28:37.794 --> 28:40.714
- Nobody worth their salt reads him.
- You read him.

28:41.256 --> 28:42.925
Well, see, I rest my case.

28:44.635 --> 28:48.889
- Does Paley read him?
- Bill Paley's not gonna do anything.

28:52.059 --> 28:53.185
Thanks, Ed.

28:54.519 --> 28:57.814
I just came by to tell you
how great the Lieutenant piece was.

28:57.898 --> 29:01.109
- Thanks. - How's the fallout?
- Mostly good, surprisingly.

29:01.318 --> 29:04.112
Is this the start?
Are you taking sides?

29:06.698 --> 29:09.743
It's just a little poke
with a stick, see what happens.

29:09.993 --> 29:11.703
You let me know if I can help.

29:11.912 --> 29:13.371
But you're a pinko.

29:16.124 --> 29:17.375
I'll see you.

29:33.350 --> 29:36.019
Hey, Joe! What's all this
Radulovich junk you're putting out?

29:36.102 --> 29:39.022
I can't talk to you now. I have
to get this film back to New York.

29:39.105 --> 29:40.440
What would you say if I told you...

29:40.523 --> 29:43.109
...that Murrow was
on the Soviet payroll in 1935?

29:45.278 --> 29:48.364
- Uh! Charlie, you wanna...
- Sure. I'll set up outside.

29:50.492 --> 29:52.118
McCarthy going
to the Eisenhower dinner?

29:52.202 --> 29:55.788
- I have no idea. I don't keep the
Senator's calendar for him! - Really?

29:59.918 --> 30:03.630
Have you ever seen any spy films?
You don't hand me a classified folder!

30:03.713 --> 30:05.840
You're supposed to slip it
into my briefcase!

30:05.923 --> 30:09.093
I didn't know who to give
this information to, Paley or Murrow.

30:09.177 --> 30:12.764
As you can imagine, Fred and I
aren't very friendly. No pun intended.

30:13.139 --> 30:14.640
No pun elocuted.

30:18.102 --> 30:20.104
- What do you got, Donald?
- In short?

30:20.354 --> 30:23.107
Murrow's been a Communist
sympathizer since the 1930's.

30:23.191 --> 30:26.736
Member of the International Workers,
sponsored educational trips to Moscow...

30:26.819 --> 30:29.363
...and on the Soviet payroll
in 1935. It's all there.

30:29.447 --> 30:31.324
You wanna know
why that's not possible?

30:31.407 --> 30:32.909
Why you'll lose this one?

30:33.367 --> 30:35.369
Because everyone in this country...

30:35.453 --> 30:38.581
...knows that Ed Murrow
is a loyal American, he's a patriot.

30:40.541 --> 30:43.294
Did you know the word "gullible"
isn't in the dictionary?

30:43.377 --> 30:46.380
- Can I give this to him?
- I'd love it! I have copies!

30:49.467 --> 30:51.010
I think you guys go too far.

30:51.385 --> 30:53.721
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck.

31:00.561 --> 31:01.896
Yes, Mr. Paley.

31:02.897 --> 31:04.523
Right away.
Yes, sir.

31:06.233 --> 31:07.693
No, he hasn't called.

31:08.986 --> 31:12.823
Yes, sir, the second he calls.
If you're in a meeting, shall I?

31:14.158 --> 31:16.035
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

31:18.787 --> 31:19.872
Mr. Murrow!

31:20.748 --> 31:22.499
Mr. Paley will see you now.

31:26.337 --> 31:30.090
- Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here.
- Thanks, Miss Mary.

31:30.674 --> 31:33.469
- Hello, Ed. - Bill...
- Sit over here, will you?

31:34.303 --> 31:35.387
How's Janet?

31:35.804 --> 31:38.223
- Your son?
- All well, thanks. How's Babe?

31:38.348 --> 31:41.518
She's fine. Her fundraiser
got rained on, so...

31:41.935 --> 31:44.813
- Oh! That's why I never plan
on anything. - Really?

31:46.356 --> 31:47.608
You'd never know.

31:51.486 --> 31:52.779
Reading fiction?

31:53.405 --> 31:55.282
I hope so. You tell me.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.535
Now we know
how they're gonna come at us.

31:58.619 --> 32:01.538
That's just the first shot.
Somebody's going to go down.

32:01.621 --> 32:04.249
Have you checked your facts?
Are you on safe ground?

32:06.543 --> 32:09.421
- Bill, it's time. Show our cards.
- My cards.

32:10.255 --> 32:14.176
You lose, what happens?
5 guys find themselves out of work.

32:14.593 --> 32:18.805
I'm responsible for a lot more
than 5 goddamn reporters. Let it go.

32:20.557 --> 32:22.726
McCarthy will self-destruct,
Cohn, all of them.

32:22.809 --> 32:25.270
You said Corporate
would not interfere with Editorial...

32:25.353 --> 32:26.855
...and that the News
was to be left...

32:26.938 --> 32:28.732
We don't make the news,
we report the news.

32:28.815 --> 32:31.568
99% of the time he's wrong about those
he's marked as Communists.

32:31.651 --> 32:33.695
If he goes too far,
the Senate will investigate him...

32:33.778 --> 32:34.779
...and we will report on that.

32:34.863 --> 32:38.158
But he's wrong 100% of the time when
he oversteps people's civil liberties.

32:38.241 --> 32:39.367
And you're trying him in the press?

32:39.451 --> 32:41.453
Does he get the right
to face his accuser?

32:41.536 --> 32:44.039
You've decided on this
and you're presenting it as fact.

32:44.122 --> 32:46.458
- What I am doing...
- I write your check.

32:46.541 --> 32:50.420
I put you in your country house,
and I put your son through school!

32:50.795 --> 32:54.424
You should have told me about this
before it went so far down the road!

33:05.935 --> 33:09.814
Everyone of your boys needs to be
clean. Do you understand? No ties.

33:10.023 --> 33:14.610
If Aaron's mother went to a group
fundraiser in 1932, he's out.

33:14.736 --> 33:18.531
Hewitt, too. Anyone in that room.
You make no mistake...

33:18.656 --> 33:22.285
...I will cut them loose. Corporate
won't interfere with Editorial.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.788
But Editorial will not jeopardize
the hundreds of employees...

33:25.872 --> 33:29.208
...of the CBS.
Do I make myself clear?

33:30.501 --> 33:31.794
Yes?

33:37.258 --> 33:40.636
Fellas, our next show is gonna be
about Senator McCarthy.

33:41.721 --> 33:43.514
And we're gonna go right at him.

33:44.140 --> 33:46.934
I don't need to tell you
how careful we have to be.

33:47.018 --> 33:50.187
If we are to do this, Ed and I
need you to be straight with us.

33:50.271 --> 33:52.481
We need to know,
for the good of the piece...

33:52.565 --> 33:56.402
...if any of you have any connection,
if you subscribed to a newsletter...

33:56.485 --> 33:58.362
...if you attended a party,
anything...

33:58.446 --> 34:01.615
...anything that could compromise this,
anything at all...

34:02.074 --> 34:04.410
...because now would be
the time to tell us.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.876
Ed, I think I should excuse myself.

34:12.835 --> 34:14.295
Palmer, you kidding?

34:15.254 --> 34:17.797
My ex was a...
I wouldn't say she was a Communist...

34:17.882 --> 34:20.967
...but she attended meetings.
It was before we were married.

34:21.051 --> 34:24.013
I didn't even really know about it
until after the divorce.

34:24.554 --> 34:27.558
But it was different then.
We were all on the same side.

34:29.059 --> 34:32.021
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know. The thing is...

34:32.103 --> 34:33.563
...somebody'll find out.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.775
They'll hurt us with it.

34:38.318 --> 34:40.779
I should have told you sooner, Ed,
I'm sorry.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.031
Fred.

34:46.243 --> 34:48.911
If none of us had ever read
a "dangerous" book...

34:49.121 --> 34:51.290
...or had a friend
who was "different"...

34:51.373 --> 34:54.042
...or never joined an organization
that advocated "change"...

34:54.126 --> 34:56.962
...we'd all be the kind of people
Joe McCarthy wants.

34:58.922 --> 35:02.551
We're gonna go with the story,
because the terror is in this room.

35:06.555 --> 35:08.849
John! Jesse!
Go through the HUAC hearings.

35:08.932 --> 35:12.853
Eddie! Palmer! Look at who
did the interviews and any speeches.

35:13.854 --> 35:15.480
Okay, fellas, here we go.

35:16.064 --> 35:18.066
His own words,
that's what we need.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.694
...said that he wouldn't remove
a General from the Army...

35:20.777 --> 35:23.780
...who supported a Communist Major.
I said, "Then, General..."

35:23.864 --> 35:26.199
"...you should be removed
from any command."

35:26.700 --> 35:30.495
"Any man who says, 'I will protect
and honor a General'..."

35:30.745 --> 35:35.083
"...'who protects Communists', is not
fit to wear that uniform, General."

35:35.375 --> 35:37.002
Ethically, we're fine.

35:37.168 --> 35:40.922
But legally, if we air this, are we
leaking closed hearing testimony?

35:41.006 --> 35:43.425
- But he chose to read it.
- We're not misquoting him.

35:43.508 --> 35:46.928
- There are other reporters.
- If it's a legal issue, it's his.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.388
I'll check with Campbell in Legal.

35:48.471 --> 35:50.515
And wait till you hear
the bleeding hearts...

35:50.974 --> 35:53.101
...scream and cry about our methods...

35:54.310 --> 35:56.354
...of trying to drag the truth...

35:57.939 --> 36:00.108
...from those who know
or should know...

36:00.942 --> 36:03.903
...who covered up
a Fifth Amendment Communist Major.

36:04.779 --> 36:06.155
But they say, "Oh..."

36:07.156 --> 36:11.160
"...it's all right to uncover them,
but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy."

36:13.246 --> 36:17.792
Did a Civil Liberties Union provide
you with an attorney at that time?

36:18.626 --> 36:20.420
I had many offers of attorneys...

36:20.503 --> 36:24.424
...and from the American Civil Liberties
Union, too. - The questions is:

36:24.507 --> 36:27.468
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

36:27.552 --> 36:30.138
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

36:30.263 --> 36:31.264
The answer is yes.

36:31.347 --> 36:33.850
You know the Civil Liberties Union
has been listed...

36:33.933 --> 36:37.145
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

36:37.645 --> 36:39.605
Mr. Chairman, this was 1932!

36:41.023 --> 36:42.358
I know this was in 1932.

36:42.441 --> 36:44.610
Do you know that they since
have been listed...

36:44.694 --> 36:47.238
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

36:47.321 --> 36:49.574
I do not know
that they have been listed so, sir.

36:49.657 --> 36:52.034
- You don't know?
- I have heard that mentioned...

36:52.118 --> 36:53.369
All right, Leo. Turn it off.

36:53.452 --> 36:57.248
- I need those three cans of Stevens!
- Has anybody read this book yet?

36:57.331 --> 36:59.667
It would be nice
if this guy isn't a Commie.

36:59.750 --> 37:02.169
- Did Millie give it to you?
- I wanna read the book.

37:02.253 --> 37:03.838
- Nobody else, Joe.
- I hear you, boss.

37:03.921 --> 37:06.257
I'll put it on a kinescope,
push through the end.

37:06.340 --> 37:07.550
Palmer, cut it at 2:30.

37:07.633 --> 37:10.010
I prefer it one on each end,
let it run through.

37:10.094 --> 37:11.929
It'd be more powerful.
Cut Kennedy?

37:12.012 --> 37:14.849
Joe, file it for me.
I'll see the Mundt piece later.

37:15.099 --> 37:16.475
Are we gonna make it, Fred?

37:16.809 --> 37:18.978
We lost the telecine,
but we'll make it.

37:22.398 --> 37:24.316
Did you finish your closing piece?

37:25.067 --> 37:26.277
It's Shakespeare.

37:28.153 --> 37:29.488
Write your closing.

37:58.058 --> 38:01.311
My argument was if you just show
the images of McCarthy...

38:01.395 --> 38:02.938
...it doesn't make any difference.

38:03.021 --> 38:05.315
If you agree with him,
you're gonna hate the piece.

38:05.399 --> 38:06.441
If you don't, you'll love it.

38:06.525 --> 38:08.527
Maybe they should wait
till they get more footage.

38:08.610 --> 38:10.112
I don't think
we can take that chance.

38:10.195 --> 38:12.823
We've got to hit McCarthy
before he comes after Ed.

38:14.574 --> 38:17.953
The blue one. They haven't gone
after the Alsops or Herb Block.

38:18.161 --> 38:20.956
Honey, the Alsops and Herb Block...

38:21.623 --> 38:25.293
...didn't work for the Institute
of International Education in 1934.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.462
Then I guess it's time.

38:34.761 --> 38:35.762
You worried?

38:38.557 --> 38:39.933
I didn't think I was.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.228
I don't know why.
I was in the office on Friday.

38:43.561 --> 38:46.606
And I answered the phone,
it was Howard calling from London.

38:46.690 --> 38:49.150
And he asked what was going on
with McCarthy.

38:49.359 --> 38:54.572
And before I answered him, I turned
and looked over my shoulder...

38:54.906 --> 38:57.784
...to see who was listening.
- And who was listening?

38:59.619 --> 39:00.829
Chairman Mao...

39:07.127 --> 39:08.586
I'll see you at the office.

39:09.546 --> 39:11.172
- Hey, your ring!
- Uh!

39:14.467 --> 39:15.927
Name me another wife...

39:16.386 --> 39:19.138
...who reminds her husband
to take off his wedding ring...

39:19.222 --> 39:22.433
...before he goes to the office.
- Ava Gardner.

39:29.774 --> 39:33.528
Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow,
Mr. Paley's on the line for you.

39:35.613 --> 39:39.242
- Maybe he wants to reimburse us
for those ads. - You'd like that!

39:39.575 --> 39:41.452
- I would like that!
- This is Ed.

39:41.744 --> 39:45.164
There's a Knickerbocker game tonight.
I've got front row seats.

39:45.373 --> 39:46.666
Are you interested?

39:47.500 --> 39:50.461
I'm busy bringing down
the network tonight, Bill.

39:50.753 --> 39:51.754
Is that tonight?

39:53.464 --> 39:54.757
We're covered, Bill.

39:55.675 --> 39:56.759
All right.

39:58.678 --> 40:03.391
- I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm
with you tomorrow. - Thanks, Bill.

40:19.156 --> 40:21.450
Do you know the timing
on the first piece?

40:22.993 --> 40:24.912
Can we hold all the calls, please?

40:25.162 --> 40:27.373
Hold the calls till after the show.
Thank you.

40:27.790 --> 40:29.917
- You fellas, awake down there?
- Okay.

40:30.251 --> 40:33.045
- Just... what are we? 20?
- 30 seconds, Ed.

40:48.936 --> 40:50.229
10 seconds.

40:54.525 --> 40:59.112
5, 4, 3, 2.

41:00.489 --> 41:01.949
And pan, camera one.

41:05.202 --> 41:09.081
Because a report on Senator McCarthy
is by definition controversial...

41:09.498 --> 41:11.833
...we want to say exactly
what we mean to say...

41:11.917 --> 41:14.670
...and request your permission
to read from a script...

41:14.753 --> 41:17.297
...whatever remarks Murrow
and Friendly may make.

41:17.839 --> 41:21.635
If the Senator feels that we have done
violence to his words or pictures...

41:21.718 --> 41:23.970
...and desires to answer himself...

41:24.137 --> 41:27.015
...an opportunity will be afforded him
on this program.

41:27.432 --> 41:30.018
Our working thesis tonight
is this quotation:

41:30.727 --> 41:32.395
..."If this fight
against Communism..."

41:32.479 --> 41:35.816
"...has made a fight between
America's two great political parties..."

41:35.899 --> 41:39.402
"...the American people know that one
of these parties will be destroyed..."

41:39.486 --> 41:42.948
"...and the Republic cannot endure
very long as a one-party system."

41:43.406 --> 41:44.991
We applaud that statement...

41:45.075 --> 41:47.327
...and we think
Senator McCarthy ought to.

41:47.535 --> 41:49.871
He said it
17 months ago in Milwaukee.

41:50.914 --> 41:54.292
The American people realize
that this cannot be made a fight...

41:54.417 --> 41:57.045
...between America's
two great political parties.

41:57.128 --> 41:58.755
If this fight against Communism...

41:58.838 --> 42:02.050
...is made a fight against America's
two great political parties...

42:02.133 --> 42:05.762
...the American people know that one
of those parties will be destroyed...

42:05.845 --> 42:09.265
...and the Republic can't endure
very long as a one-party system.

42:10.100 --> 42:12.727
On one thing the Senator
has been consistent.

42:13.269 --> 42:16.606
Often operating as a one-man
committee, he has traveled far...

42:16.689 --> 42:18.900
...interviewed many,
terrorized some...

42:19.400 --> 42:21.444
...accused civilian
and military leaders...

42:21.528 --> 42:23.988
...of the past administration
of a great conspiracy...

42:24.072 --> 42:26.074
...to turn over the country
to Communism.

42:26.157 --> 42:30.578
I was extremely shocked when I heard
that Secretary Stevens...

42:31.079 --> 42:35.416
...told 2 Army officers that they had
to take part in the cover up...

42:35.917 --> 42:38.503
...of those who promoted
and coddled Communists.

42:38.711 --> 42:41.631
As I read his statement, I...

42:42.590 --> 42:45.593
...thought of that quotation,
"On what meat..."

42:46.344 --> 42:48.513
"...doth this our Caesar feed?".

42:48.638 --> 42:49.639
The questions is:

42:49.722 --> 42:52.767
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

42:52.850 --> 42:55.436
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

42:55.520 --> 42:56.521
The answer is yes.

42:56.604 --> 42:59.357
Do you think this book
did considerable harm?

42:59.565 --> 43:00.983
Its publication...

43:02.068 --> 43:04.779
...by an expression of the views
contained in it?

43:05.071 --> 43:08.407
The sale of that book
was so abysmally small...

43:08.908 --> 43:13.287
...it was so unsuccessful,
that the question of its influence...

43:13.704 --> 43:15.539
You can go back
to the publisher...

43:15.623 --> 43:19.293
...you'll see it was one of the most
unsuccessful books he ever put out.

43:19.376 --> 43:21.545
He's still sorry about it,
just as I am.

43:21.837 --> 43:25.049
Well, I think that's a compliment
to American intelligence.

43:25.925 --> 43:27.051
I'll say that.

43:27.718 --> 43:31.430
The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates
one of the Senator's techniques.

43:31.514 --> 43:32.765
Twice he said...

43:33.015 --> 43:36.894
..."The American Civil Liberties Union
was listed as a subversive front."

43:36.977 --> 43:39.980
The Attorney General's list does not
and never has listed...

43:40.064 --> 43:42.900
...the ACLU as subversive,
nor does the FBI...

43:42.983 --> 43:45.235
...or any other
federal government agency.

43:45.569 --> 43:48.697
And the American Civil Liberties Union
holds in its files...

43:48.781 --> 43:51.408
...letters of commendation
from President Truman...

43:51.492 --> 43:54.119
...President Eisenhower,
and General MacArthur.

43:55.162 --> 43:59.625
Earlier, the Senator asked, "Upon what
meat does this our Caesar feed?".

43:59.917 --> 44:02.628
Had he looked three lines earlier
in Shakespeare's "Caesar"...

44:02.711 --> 44:06.298
...he would have found this line,
which is not altogether inappropriate.

44:06.381 --> 44:10.677
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

44:11.386 --> 44:13.639
No one familiar with the history
of this country...

44:13.722 --> 44:16.433
...can deny that Congressional
committees are useful.

44:16.516 --> 44:19.394
It is necessary to investigate
before legislating...

44:19.478 --> 44:23.065
...but the line between investigating
and persecuting is a very fine one...

44:23.148 --> 44:27.027
...and the junior Senator from Wisconsin
has stepped over it repeatedly.

44:27.194 --> 44:29.780
We must not confuse dissent
with disloyalty.

44:30.364 --> 44:33.450
We must remember always
that accusation is not proof...

44:33.742 --> 44:37.496
...and that conviction depends
upon evidence and due process of law.

44:38.455 --> 44:40.749
We will not walk in fear,
one of another.

44:40.832 --> 44:43.710
We will not be driven by fear
into an age of unreason...

44:43.793 --> 44:46.463
...if we dig deep
in our history and doctrine...

44:46.671 --> 44:49.966
...and remember that we are not
descended from fearful men...

44:50.133 --> 44:53.678
...not from men who feared to write,
to associate, to speak...

44:53.762 --> 44:57.182
...and to defend the causes
that were for the moment unpopular.

44:57.766 --> 45:01.144
This is no time for men who oppose
Senator McCarthy's methods...

45:01.227 --> 45:03.813
...to keep silent,
or for those who approve.

45:04.522 --> 45:07.067
We can deny our heritage
and our history...

45:07.150 --> 45:09.944
...but we cannot escape
responsibility for the results.

45:10.528 --> 45:12.822
We proclaim ourselves,
indeed as we are...

45:12.906 --> 45:16.868
...the defenders of freedom wherever
it continues to exist in the world...

45:16.951 --> 45:20.455
...but we cannot defend freedom abroad
by deserting it at home.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.416
The actions of the junior Senator
from Wisconsin...

45:23.500 --> 45:26.502
...have caused alarm and dismay
amongst our allies abroad...

45:26.586 --> 45:29.130
...and given considerable comfort
to our enemies.

45:29.756 --> 45:32.675
And whose fault is that?
Not really his.

45:33.134 --> 45:35.470
He didn't create
this situation of fear...

45:35.720 --> 45:38.723
...he merely exploited it,
and rather successfully.

45:40.266 --> 45:41.601
Cassius was right.

45:42.143 --> 45:46.522
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

45:47.523 --> 45:49.609
Good night, and good luck.

45:57.325 --> 45:58.451
And we're out.

46:12.089 --> 46:13.132
Nothing?

46:16.344 --> 46:17.845
Maybe nobody watched.

46:22.933 --> 46:25.311
- We got nothing.
- I don't know. - Nothing.

46:25.811 --> 46:28.397
Should I turn the phones back on,
Mr. Williams?

46:29.899 --> 46:32.276
Yes. Now would be
a good time for that.

46:33.027 --> 46:35.196
Turn the phones on!
Turn the pho...

46:35.946 --> 46:37.573
Mr. Friendly wants the phones on.

46:37.656 --> 46:39.408
It's the Junior Senator
calling collect.

46:39.491 --> 46:42.745
Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris
thanking us for mentioning him.

46:42.828 --> 46:45.831
I don't know whether all of you
have seen what I just saw...

46:45.915 --> 46:48.626
...but I want to associate myself
and this program...

46:48.709 --> 46:50.336
...with what Ed Murrow
has just said...

46:50.419 --> 46:53.172
...and say I have never been
prouder of CBS.

46:56.050 --> 47:00.137
Senator McCarthy said today that he
would demand equal free television...

47:04.933 --> 47:08.854
Stevenson had charged that the Senator
made demagoguery and deceit...

47:09.104 --> 47:10.898
...the national policy...

47:13.567 --> 47:15.736
- Is that Hollenbeck?
- Congratulations!

47:15.819 --> 47:16.862
Great show!

47:17.696 --> 47:18.989
Feel like a Scotch?

47:19.573 --> 47:21.658
I think everybody
could use a Scotch.

48:13.334 --> 48:16.546
- It's 3:30, early editions are out.
- I'm not worried about that.

48:16.629 --> 48:18.298
Of course not.
Shirley, honey...

48:18.381 --> 48:21.342
...would you go across the street
and get the early editions?

48:21.426 --> 48:23.386
- All of them?
- Just get O'Brian!

48:26.014 --> 48:27.932
- Hey, watch my drink!
- Yeah.

49:00.298 --> 49:02.133
Okay. Here we go.

49:02.717 --> 49:05.636
- At last!
- The Times. - The Times...

49:05.761 --> 49:06.804
- First?
- Good.

49:07.471 --> 49:09.307
- Who wrote it?
- Jack Gould.

49:09.849 --> 49:11.183
Gould...

49:11.684 --> 49:15.187
Edward R. Murrow's television program
on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy...

49:15.271 --> 49:19.108
...was an exciting and provocative
examination of the man and his methods.

49:19.191 --> 49:22.737
It was crusading journalism
of high responsibility and courage.

49:22.820 --> 49:25.573
For TV so often plagued
by timidity and hesitation...

49:25.656 --> 49:29.452
...the program was a milestone
that reflected enlightened citizenship.

49:29.577 --> 49:30.828
The program... Hold on!

49:30.911 --> 49:33.706
The program was no less
an indictment of those who wish...

49:33.789 --> 49:36.876
...the problems posed
by the Senator's tactics and theatrics...

49:36.959 --> 49:38.961
...would just go away
and leave them alone.

49:39.044 --> 49:42.006
That was Mr. Murrow's
and television's triumph...

49:42.089 --> 49:43.632
...and a very great one.

49:47.011 --> 49:48.137
Here! Here!

49:48.304 --> 49:50.431
- He hated it.
- Yeah. What's his beef?

49:51.056 --> 49:52.933
Send the New York Times
a bottle of Scotch.

49:53.017 --> 49:55.060
I already did. How do you think
we got that review?

49:55.144 --> 49:57.104
- How's the Post?
- Pretty good!

49:57.813 --> 49:59.815
- What about O'Brian?
- Uh, the same.

50:01.316 --> 50:04.361
- Go on, read O'Brian!
- I don't have it.

50:04.445 --> 50:05.904
- Got it.
- Oh. Here.

50:08.157 --> 50:10.033
- There we go.
- Shirley, that...

50:13.662 --> 50:17.249
We can't say we were surprised at
Murrow's "Hate McCarthy" telecast...

50:17.332 --> 50:20.294
...last evening, when his explosively
one-sided propaganda...

50:20.377 --> 50:23.714
...edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy's march...

50:23.797 --> 50:26.216
...against Communism,
was finished last evening...

50:26.300 --> 50:29.720
...by equally Machiavellian coincidence
the following telecast...

50:29.803 --> 50:32.806
...featured Murrow's PM protégé,
Hollenbeck.

50:33.557 --> 50:35.934
In an obviously gloating mood,
Hollenbeck...

50:36.018 --> 50:39.479
...hoped viewers had witnessed
his patron's triumph...

50:39.563 --> 50:40.897
...from and for the Left.

50:42.065 --> 50:43.275
So on. So on...

50:43.358 --> 50:45.485
Shirley, it's okay.
Go ahead, finish it.

50:45.569 --> 50:48.738
- No, that's it. That's it.
- Shirley, please, finish it.

50:51.908 --> 50:56.580
The CBS has been in a lengthy
"clean house of Lefties" mood.

50:56.663 --> 50:58.373
The worst offenders
on lesser levels...

50:58.456 --> 51:00.667
...have been quietly
pushed out of the company.

51:00.750 --> 51:04.713
Don Hollenbeck, a graduate
of the demised pinko publication PM...

51:04.796 --> 51:08.592
...attacked conservative papers
with sly and slanted propaganda.

51:08.675 --> 51:11.011
He then proceeded
through an equally...

51:12.846 --> 51:14.639
...tilted review of the day's events...

51:14.723 --> 51:18.101
...with McCarthy dominating his words,
actions, attitudes.

51:19.060 --> 51:20.061
So on.

51:22.856 --> 51:25.775
- It's O'Brian. - He didn't get
the Scotch, that's all.

51:26.234 --> 51:29.279
- Is it grammatically correct?
- I'll have that cigarette, Ed.

51:30.822 --> 51:33.867
- Thanks, Shirley.
- Oh. - Mmh. - Thank you.

51:34.033 --> 51:36.327
Joe... Shirley...

51:41.249 --> 51:42.542
It doesn't matter.

51:47.797 --> 51:48.923
To Jack Gould!

51:50.049 --> 51:52.927
- To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould!
- To Jack Gould!

51:53.011 --> 51:54.012
I love Jack Gould!

51:55.972 --> 51:57.515
May he rest in peace.

51:59.726 --> 52:02.562
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Fred, congratulations! - Thank you.

52:03.354 --> 52:05.731
I got such a hangover
to go along with the ulcer.

52:05.815 --> 52:07.692
All the ad guys on the 3rd floor
watched the show.

52:07.775 --> 52:09.777
Got a good review
in the New York Times. Jack Gould.

52:09.861 --> 52:11.237
We're putting out a press release...

52:11.320 --> 52:14.198
...saying that calls came in
15 to 1 in favor of the show. - Really?

52:14.282 --> 52:16.659
- Yeah. - 15 to 1?
- We got calls from everywhere.

52:16.951 --> 52:20.288
- East Coast or West Coast?
- Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati...

52:21.289 --> 52:22.415
Mr. Paley...

52:23.499 --> 52:25.668
- Morning, Fred.
- Morning, Mr. Paley.

52:30.715 --> 52:31.799
How's your wife?

52:32.258 --> 52:34.427
She's fine.
We're getting ready to move.

52:34.510 --> 52:37.596
- Really? Where to? - Riverdale.
We found a nice house there.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.681
It's nice there.

52:39.515 --> 52:40.599
Yes, sir.

52:47.648 --> 52:48.649
Excuse me.

52:48.858 --> 52:52.695
Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckley
to do his rebuttal.

52:53.946 --> 52:55.030
I said no.

52:56.824 --> 52:57.866
Yes, sir.

53:04.248 --> 53:05.249
Hey, Johnny!

53:05.499 --> 53:07.751
- Radulovich has been reinstated.
- What?!

53:07.835 --> 53:10.587
Radulovich... Guys!
Radulovich has been reinstated.

53:10.671 --> 53:12.548
- Jesse! Jesse!
- Where is Ed?

53:12.631 --> 53:15.175
- He's in the bullpen. Why?
What's going on? - Jess!

53:15.259 --> 53:16.760
Got some very good news.

53:17.386 --> 53:20.472
Special announcement
from the Secretary of the Air Force!

53:20.556 --> 53:22.599
Fellas! Listen up! Everyone!

53:23.433 --> 53:25.602
I have decided
that it is consistent...

53:25.686 --> 53:28.438
...with the interests
of the National Security to retain...

53:28.522 --> 53:31.817
...Lieutenant Radulovich
in the United States Air Force. Stop.

53:31.984 --> 53:35.320
He is not, in my opinion,
a security risk. Full stop.

53:37.948 --> 53:41.576
There you go. Harold E. Talbott,
Secretary from the Air Force.

53:42.244 --> 53:43.245
Great job!

53:43.328 --> 53:45.247
- Make a copy of that for me!
- I will do, Fred!

53:45.330 --> 53:47.290
Back to work, guys!
We got a lot of work to do.

53:47.374 --> 53:48.625
This means something.

53:48.709 --> 53:50.293
- Good news, huh?
- Congratulations!

53:50.377 --> 53:54.423
- This absolutely means something.
- Absolutely. This is the start of...

54:01.429 --> 54:02.430
Palmer!

54:05.517 --> 54:07.561
The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you.

54:11.147 --> 54:12.190
When?

54:12.774 --> 54:13.900
Tomorrow.

54:14.818 --> 54:18.196
I don't want you to get paranoid,
they're talking to everybody.

54:18.279 --> 54:19.322
Any ideas?

54:20.907 --> 54:22.534
Just tell them what you know.

54:22.617 --> 54:25.328
- Now is that testimony true?
- No, sir, it is not.

54:25.412 --> 54:28.623
Not at any time have I been
a member of the Communist Party...

54:28.706 --> 54:31.042
...and I have never seen
a Communist card.

54:31.126 --> 54:33.461
- You've never seen a Communist card?
- That's right.

54:33.545 --> 54:35.505
Have you ever attended
any Communist meetings?

54:35.588 --> 54:37.215
No, sir, never.

54:37.298 --> 54:39.551
Have you ever subscribed
to The Daily Worker?

54:39.634 --> 54:43.429
No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it
and I wouldn't pay for it.

54:44.222 --> 54:49.435
Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward,
who was working for the FBI...

54:50.144 --> 54:53.481
...who joined the Communist Party
under orders from the FBI...

54:53.606 --> 54:56.776
...has testified that while
she never met you personally...

54:56.985 --> 55:00.196
...at a Communist meeting
that your name was on the list...

55:00.279 --> 55:02.448
...of Communists
who were paying dues.

55:02.949 --> 55:05.701
Uh... Can you shed
any light upon that?

55:06.577 --> 55:09.455
No, sir. I don't even know
what the dues are...

55:09.622 --> 55:13.126
...or where they were paid.
- So you have never paid any money...

55:14.168 --> 55:16.003
...to the Communist Party.

55:16.754 --> 55:18.464
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

55:18.631 --> 55:20.758
You've never paid
any dues, payment...

55:20.841 --> 55:22.510
Thank you very much, Leo!

55:23.427 --> 55:25.263
Good work, Joe, Charlie.

55:25.888 --> 55:27.223
Now what is the show?

55:27.306 --> 55:30.059
Is it defending Annie Lee Moss
as not being a Communist?

55:30.142 --> 55:32.728
- Or is it her Constitutional rights?
- Both. - The latter.

55:32.812 --> 55:35.272
We're much better sticking out
the Constitutional issues.

55:35.356 --> 55:37.066
- Agreed?
- The woman is not a Communist spy.

55:37.149 --> 55:39.777
Joe McCarthy said that they have
a spy in the Pentagon...

55:39.860 --> 55:41.570
...that spy has gotten
into the code room...

55:41.654 --> 55:43.406
...and that that spy
is Annie Lee Moss.

55:43.489 --> 55:45.991
I've got New York Times reports.
McCarthy asserts he has...

55:46.075 --> 55:48.911
...a new red link to Army. Quote,
"Senator McCarthy charged today..."

55:48.994 --> 55:51.539
"...that the Army now employs
a woman in its code room..."

55:51.622 --> 55:54.208
"...who was, and still may be,
an active Communist."

55:54.291 --> 55:55.793
It's the front page
of the New York Times.

55:55.876 --> 55:59.547
No sooner is he done chastising the
other committee members for wanting...

55:59.630 --> 56:02.591
...to push into the afternoon,
than what? Seven questions in...

56:02.675 --> 56:04.301
...he ducks out, leaves...
- Right.

56:04.385 --> 56:07.388
- He leaves. - It's all over
the headlines, all over the country.

56:07.471 --> 56:09.056
Get me copies from any newspaper...

56:09.139 --> 56:10.766
...that printed anything
about that assertion.

56:10.849 --> 56:14.186
That's a good idea. You should get
the Cincinnati Inquirer.

56:14.269 --> 56:17.314
- Chicago. - Couple other pieces
I think we should include.

56:17.398 --> 56:20.526
The fact that there's 3 Annie Lee Moss's
in the phone book.

56:20.609 --> 56:23.654
There are 2 Robert Halls,
one's colored, one's white.

56:23.737 --> 56:25.656
We have some footage
of the empty chair.

56:25.739 --> 56:28.909
I think that says it all.
Just that picture of McCarthy not...

56:28.992 --> 56:31.829
McCarthy leaving the hearing
after 7 questions...

56:31.912 --> 56:34.081
...and then we'll cut
to the shot of the chair.

56:34.164 --> 56:36.833
- We gotta do something about it.
- All right, so...

56:36.917 --> 56:40.796
Excuse me. Mr. Murrow!
McCarthy wants April 6th.

56:44.591 --> 56:45.884
Thank you, Natalie.

56:50.514 --> 56:53.767
Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get
to see it first. We should offer.

56:53.850 --> 56:56.436
- It's a long shot.
- What the hell could McCarthy do?

56:56.520 --> 56:59.022
Is he gonna debate himself?
We just used his words!

57:02.359 --> 57:04.569
Johnny! Johnny! We know
what it's going to be.

57:04.653 --> 57:07.656
He's going to come after me.
There's nothing more he can do.

57:07.739 --> 57:10.242
He's gonna bet that
a Senator trumps a newsman.

57:11.159 --> 57:12.202
He'll lose.

57:12.619 --> 57:14.246
Not if we're playing bridge.

57:15.956 --> 57:18.833
- I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean
to interrupt. - Hey, Don.

57:18.917 --> 57:21.086
- It's getting fun now!
- Ed, you have a minute?

57:21.544 --> 57:25.173
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- All right, boys. Playtime's over.

57:25.548 --> 57:26.925
We have 4 days...

57:27.175 --> 57:29.678
...to do a 28 minute show.
- Yeah. - All right.

57:29.761 --> 57:31.221
All right, go ahead.
Hi, Mary.

57:31.304 --> 57:33.014
Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck.
Mr. Murrow...

57:33.098 --> 57:34.933
- Could you give us a moment?
- Sure.

57:36.810 --> 57:37.894
Thank you, dear.

57:39.646 --> 57:42.357
I have to ask you something, Ed.
It's about O'Brian.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.359
- O'Brian doesn't matter.
- He's killing me, Ed.

57:44.442 --> 57:46.236
He doesn't amount to that much
in the newsroom.

57:46.319 --> 57:47.737
We've got to let that guy have it.

57:47.820 --> 57:51.115
We're not going after O'Brian. I will
not take on McCarthy and Hearst.

57:51.199 --> 57:52.492
I can't defeat them both.

57:53.576 --> 57:56.871
Just don't read the papers.
Or don't read O'Brian, anyway.

58:02.085 --> 58:04.379
Okay. I guess not.

58:05.672 --> 58:06.756
Sorry, Don.

58:20.853 --> 58:22.730
Although Mrs. Moss
offered to testify...

58:22.813 --> 58:25.942
...Senator McCarthy suggested
that she was too sick.

58:26.025 --> 58:29.737
- She agreed... - Mr. Cohn wanted
to know about Mrs. Moss's connection...

58:29.820 --> 58:33.491
...to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth...

58:33.574 --> 58:34.742
...so help you God?

58:38.537 --> 58:41.207
May we get your full name
for the record, please?

58:41.582 --> 58:42.917
Annie Lee Moss.

58:44.043 --> 58:45.711
- M-O-S-S?
- That's right.

58:46.045 --> 58:49.298
Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record,
for your information...

58:49.381 --> 58:51.592
...for the information
of your counsel...

58:52.093 --> 58:54.053
...that you are not here because...

58:55.387 --> 59:00.434
...you are considered important
in the Communist apparatus.

59:00.559 --> 59:04.063
We have the testimony that you are,
and have been, a Communist.

59:05.272 --> 59:08.651
We are rather curious, however,
to know how you suddenly...

59:09.944 --> 59:11.362
...were shifted from...

59:13.280 --> 59:16.325
...a worker in a cafeteria
to the code room.

59:16.617 --> 59:19.912
I am today much more interested...

59:20.662 --> 59:24.375
...in the handling of your case...

59:25.125 --> 59:28.337
...by your superiors
than in your own personal activities.

59:28.712 --> 59:32.883
However, counsel will question you
about your own activities also.

59:33.217 --> 59:36.303
- Mr. Chairman!
- We will not hear from counsel.

59:36.887 --> 59:38.889
You have been told what the rule is.

59:39.181 --> 59:42.226
If you have anything to say,
say it through your client.

59:45.896 --> 59:49.650
Chairman. Did you begin work
at the General Accounting Office in...

59:50.525 --> 59:52.736
...1945?
- Yes, sir.

59:53.612 --> 59:57.866
And, prior to that time,
had you been a cafeteria worker?

59:57.949 --> 59:59.284
Yes, I had.

59:59.576 --> 01:00:03.914
I see. While in the Pentagon,
since 1950...

01:00:04.247 --> 01:00:07.000
...have you had any connections
with coded messages?

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:09.044
Have you ever handled
coded messages?

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:12.672
- No more than to transmit 'em.
- Pardon me?

01:00:12.964 --> 01:00:15.175
No more than to transmit
the message.

01:00:15.258 --> 01:00:17.636
Than to transmit them?
Did you transmit codes?

01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:20.430
To receive or transmit messages
was all I had to do.

01:00:20.513 --> 01:00:23.141
And I've never been
into a courtroom in my life.

01:00:23.683 --> 01:00:24.976
Do you know the...

01:00:26.978 --> 01:00:28.647
...type of classification...

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:32.901
- Do you know if they were secret,
top secret, confidential? - No, sir.

01:00:33.151 --> 01:00:36.529
- You wouldn't know the degree
of classification? - No, sir.

01:00:36.946 --> 01:00:37.989
I see.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.368
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to excuse myself, I've got...

01:00:43.536 --> 01:00:47.582
...a rather important appointment
to work on right now...

01:00:47.665 --> 01:00:51.920
...and I wonder if, Senator Mundt,
you would take over as Chairman?

01:00:56.883 --> 01:00:58.426
- Chairman. Uh...
- Cohn.

01:00:58.509 --> 01:01:01.554
I have no further questions
of this witness at this time.

01:01:01.638 --> 01:01:05.767
We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward,
the undercover agent for the FBI...

01:01:06.059 --> 01:01:09.604
...stating that Annie Lee Moss
was a member, a dues-paying member...

01:01:09.687 --> 01:01:11.439
...of the Communist Party...

01:01:11.898 --> 01:01:14.192
...the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

01:01:14.275 --> 01:01:17.612
We have corroboration
of that testimony by another...

01:01:18.613 --> 01:01:20.865
...witness who was called
before the Committee...

01:01:20.948 --> 01:01:22.784
...and gave a sworn statement
to the effect...

01:01:22.867 --> 01:01:25.536
...that she also knew Mrs. Moss
as a member...

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.663
...of the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

01:01:27.747 --> 01:01:32.001
She's already lost her job. She's been
suspended because of this action.

01:01:32.752 --> 01:01:36.297
I'm not defending her. If she's
a Communist, I want her exposed.

01:01:36.631 --> 01:01:40.301
But to make these statements
as we've got corroborating evidence...

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.929
...that she is a Communist,
under these circumstances...

01:01:44.013 --> 01:01:47.641
...I think she's entitled to have it
produced here in her presence...

01:01:47.808 --> 01:01:51.103
...and let the public know about it
and let her know about it.

01:01:54.523 --> 01:01:57.818
I don't like to try people
by hearsay evidence.

01:01:59.195 --> 01:02:01.947
I'd like to get the witnesses here
and try them...

01:02:03.657 --> 01:02:05.367
...by testimony, under oath.

01:02:05.659 --> 01:02:09.246
The Chair will rule
that the comment of Mr. Cohn...

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:10.956
...be stricken from the record.

01:02:11.207 --> 01:02:13.751
I didn't ask that, Mr. Chairman!

01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:16.462
...whether we should try to produce
a witness in public...

01:02:16.545 --> 01:02:19.757
...because the FBI may have
her undercover and we don't want to...

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.386
You can't strike these statements
made by counsel here as to evidence...

01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:28.682
...that we're having and withholding.
You cannot strike that from the press...

01:02:28.766 --> 01:02:33.896
...nor from the public mind
once it's planted there. That's the...

01:02:35.814 --> 01:02:37.149
...evil of it!

01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:40.652
- Well, I'd look at it...
- I don't think it's fair to a witness...

01:02:40.736 --> 01:02:42.196
...to a citizen of this country...

01:02:42.279 --> 01:02:44.364
...to bring them up here
and cross-examine them...

01:02:44.448 --> 01:02:45.866
...then when they get through, say...

01:02:45.949 --> 01:02:48.911
..."The FBI has got something on you
that condemns you."

01:02:48.994 --> 01:02:51.705
- The Chair agrees...
- It is not sworn testimony...

01:02:51.788 --> 01:02:55.417
...it's convicting people
by rumor and hearsay and innuendo.

01:02:57.085 --> 01:03:00.714
You will notice that neither Senator
McClellan or Senator Symington...

01:03:00.797 --> 01:03:05.135
...nor this reporter know or claim
that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist.

01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:08.013
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:10.307
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

01:03:25.155 --> 01:03:29.242
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

01:03:29.659 --> 01:03:31.453
We labeled it as controversial.

01:03:31.995 --> 01:03:35.665
Most of that report consisted
of words and pictures of the Senator.

01:03:36.249 --> 01:03:37.792
At that time, we said...

01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:41.880
..."If the Senator believes we have done
violence to his words or pictures..."

01:03:41.963 --> 01:03:44.549
"...if he desires to speak,
to answer himself..."

01:03:44.632 --> 01:03:47.761
"...an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program."

01:03:48.052 --> 01:03:51.764
The Senator sought the opportunity
after 3 weeks...

01:03:51.848 --> 01:03:55.935
...because he was very busy and wished
adequate time to prepare his reply.

01:03:56.477 --> 01:03:57.520
We agreed.

01:03:58.021 --> 01:04:02.191
We placed no restrictions on the manner
of the presentation of his reply...

01:04:02.317 --> 01:04:05.403
...and we suggested that we would not
take time to comment...

01:04:05.486 --> 01:04:07.238
...on this particular program.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.743
Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,
junior Senator from Wisconsin.

01:04:13.161 --> 01:04:19.500
Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow,
Educational Director of the CBS...

01:04:20.501 --> 01:04:22.837
...devoted his program
to an attack...

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.132
...on the work of the US Senate
Investigating Committee...

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:28.759
...and on me personally
as its Chairman.

01:04:29.594 --> 01:04:33.222
Now, over the past 4 years,
he has made repeated attacks upon me...

01:04:33.681 --> 01:04:35.474
...and those fighting Communists.

01:04:36.893 --> 01:04:40.104
Of course, neither Joe McCarthy
nor Edward R. Murrow...

01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:43.691
...is of any great importance
as individuals.

01:04:44.775 --> 01:04:46.277
We are only important...

01:04:46.611 --> 01:04:50.656
...in our relation to the great struggle
to preserve our American liberties.

01:04:51.115 --> 01:04:55.828
Now ordinarily, I wouldn't take time
out from the important work at hand...

01:04:56.579 --> 01:04:57.830
...to answer Murrow.

01:04:58.330 --> 01:04:59.874
However, in this case...

01:04:59.957 --> 01:05:03.753
...I feel justified in doing so
because Murrow is the symbol...

01:05:04.503 --> 01:05:05.588
...the leader...

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:11.010
...and the cleverest of the jackal pack
which is always found at the throat...

01:05:11.427 --> 01:05:15.472
...of anyone who dares to expose
individual Communists and traitors.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.601
And I am compelled by the fact...

01:05:19.018 --> 01:05:21.520
...to say to you
that Mr. Edward R. Murrow...

01:05:22.104 --> 01:05:24.648
...as far back as 20 years ago...

01:05:25.316 --> 01:05:28.736
...was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes.

01:05:29.945 --> 01:05:32.990
For example, the Institute
of International Education...

01:05:33.198 --> 01:05:35.451
...of which he was
the Acting Director...

01:05:36.034 --> 01:05:38.996
...was chosen to act
as a representative...

01:05:39.371 --> 01:05:41.039
...by a Soviet agency...

01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:47.588
...to do a job which would normally
be done by the Russian secret police.

01:05:48.505 --> 01:05:52.175
Mr. Murrow, by his own admission,
was a member of the IWW...

01:05:52.259 --> 01:05:54.803
...that's the Industrial Workers
of the World...

01:05:54.887 --> 01:05:57.681
...a terrorist organization
cited as subversive...

01:05:58.265 --> 01:06:00.767
...by an Attorney General
of the United States.

01:06:00.934 --> 01:06:04.271
Mr. Murrow said on this program
and I quote...

01:06:05.063 --> 01:06:08.775
..."The actions of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin..."

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:14.156
"...have given considerable comfort
to the enemy."

01:06:14.781 --> 01:06:18.702
That is the language of our statute
of treason, rather strong language.

01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:24.791
If I am giving comfort to our enemies,
I ought not to be in the Senate.

01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:27.043
If, on the other hand,
Mr. Murrow...

01:06:27.502 --> 01:06:29.588
...is giving comfort to our enemies...

01:06:29.838 --> 01:06:32.299
...he ought not to be brought
into the homes...

01:06:32.507 --> 01:06:36.094
...of millions of Americans
by the CBS.

01:06:36.219 --> 01:06:37.679
And I want to assure you...

01:06:38.805 --> 01:06:41.808
...that I will not be deterred...

01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:48.398
...by the attacks of the Murrows,
the Lattimores, the Fosters...

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:53.153
...The Daily Worker
or the Communist Party itself.

01:06:55.321 --> 01:06:58.450
And I make no claim to leadership.

01:07:00.743 --> 01:07:02.328
In complete humility...

01:07:04.163 --> 01:07:08.293
...I do ask you and every American
who loves this country...

01:07:09.002 --> 01:07:10.628
...to join with me.

01:07:38.698 --> 01:07:40.783
[Everyone talks about the weather.]

01:07:41.617 --> 01:07:44.453
[Wherever you look
on America's modern farms...]

01:07:44.745 --> 01:07:49.208
[... aluminum is on the job, helping the
farmer do something about the weather.]

01:07:50.084 --> 01:07:53.337
[Aluminum for the farm
is one more example of how Alcoa...]

01:07:53.421 --> 01:07:54.797
[... since 1888...]

01:07:55.131 --> 01:07:58.968
[... has continued to pioneer
new uses for this vital metal.]

01:07:59.552 --> 01:08:03.681
[New uses of aluminum that mean
better farms and better farming.]

01:08:04.306 --> 01:08:07.977
[The aluminum from the nation's
first and leading producer...]

01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:12.022
[... Alcoa,
Aluminum Company of America.]

01:08:12.523 --> 01:08:15.025
Last week, Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program...

01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:17.611
...to correct any errors
he might have thought we made...

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:19.279
...in our report of March 9th.

01:08:19.363 --> 01:08:22.783
Since he made no reference to any
statements of fact that we made...

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:25.618
...we must conclude
that he found no errors of fact.

01:08:26.537 --> 01:08:29.038
He proved again
that anyone who exposes him...

01:08:29.122 --> 01:08:33.752
...anyone who doesn't share his disregard
for decency and human dignity...

01:08:33.877 --> 01:08:36.380
...and the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution...

01:08:36.462 --> 01:08:39.174
...must be either a Communist
or a fellow traveler.

01:08:39.758 --> 01:08:41.551
I fully expected this treatment.

01:08:42.344 --> 01:08:45.805
The Senator added this reporter's name
to a long list of individuals...

01:08:45.889 --> 01:08:49.393
...and institutions he has accused
of serving the Communist cause.

01:08:49.768 --> 01:08:51.520
His proposition is very simple:

01:08:51.854 --> 01:08:55.357
...anyone who criticizes or opposes
Senator McCarthy's methods...

01:08:55.566 --> 01:08:56.984
...must be a Communist.

01:08:57.693 --> 01:09:01.446
And if that be true, there are
an awful lot of Communists in the USA.

01:09:02.113 --> 01:09:05.742
For the record, let's consider briefly
some of the Senator's charges.

01:09:05.826 --> 01:09:07.911
He claimed, but offered no proof...

01:09:07.995 --> 01:09:11.331
...that I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World.

01:09:11.415 --> 01:09:12.582
That is false.

01:09:13.207 --> 01:09:16.962
I was never a member of the IWW,
never applied for membership.

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:20.674
The Senator charged
that Professor Harold Laski...

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:23.801
...a British scholar and politician,
dedicated a book to me.

01:09:23.885 --> 01:09:24.970
That's true.

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:28.723
He is dead.
He was a socialist, I am not.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.475
He was a civilized individual...

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.813
...who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles...

01:09:34.895 --> 01:09:37.732
...as a pre-condition
for conversation or friendship.

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:40.402
I do not agree
with his political ideas.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:43.822
Laski, as he makes clear
in the introduction...

01:09:43.904 --> 01:09:47.367
...dedicated the book to me,
not because of political agreement...

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:51.287
...but because he held my wartime
broadcast from London in high regard.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.497
And the dedication so reads.

01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:57.544
I believed 20 years ago
and I believe today...

01:09:58.002 --> 01:10:01.631
...that mature Americans can engage
in conversation and controversy...

01:10:01.714 --> 01:10:04.968
...the clash of ideas, with Communists
anywhere in the world...

01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:07.595
...without becoming
contaminated or converted.

01:10:08.388 --> 01:10:10.974
I believe that our faith,
our conviction...

01:10:11.349 --> 01:10:13.851
...our determination
are stronger than theirs...

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:18.564
...and that we can successfully compete,
not only in the area of bombs...

01:10:19.023 --> 01:10:20.858
...but in the area of ideas.

01:10:23.111 --> 01:10:25.780
I have worked with CBS
for more than 19 years.

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:29.909
The company has subscribed fully
to my integrity and responsibility...

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:32.412
...as a broadcaster
and as a loyal American.

01:10:33.246 --> 01:10:36.707
I require no lectures from the junior
Senator from Wisconsin...

01:10:36.791 --> 01:10:39.418
...as to the dangers
or terrors of Communism.

01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:42.922
Having searched my conscience
and my files...

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:46.050
...I cannot contend that
I have always been right or wise...

01:10:46.133 --> 01:10:49.262
...but I have attempted to pursue
the truth with diligence...

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.471
...and to report it...

01:10:50.555 --> 01:10:53.641
...even though, as in this case,
I had been warned in advance...

01:10:53.724 --> 01:10:57.270
...that I would be subjected
to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

01:10:58.229 --> 01:11:02.358
We shall hope to deal with matters
of more vital interest next week.

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.860
Good night, and good luck.

01:11:12.576 --> 01:11:16.372
In the last analysis, the Senator was
perched on the television high dive...

01:11:16.455 --> 01:11:18.749
...and all prepared
to make a resounding splash.

01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:21.544
He jumped beautifully,
but he neglected to check first...

01:11:21.627 --> 01:11:24.421
...where he was going to land.
It must have been a shock...

01:11:24.505 --> 01:11:28.008
...to discover that Mr. Murrow
had drained the water out of the pool.

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:31.470
- Is that the Times? Gould?
- Yeah, it's Jack Gould.

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:33.639
- He's a hell of a writer.
- Yes, he is.

01:11:34.265 --> 01:11:36.934
- If we can afford him!
- Stanton's got a public opinion...

01:11:37.017 --> 01:11:38.602
Senate's investigating McCarthy.

01:11:39.687 --> 01:11:40.729
What?

01:11:40.854 --> 01:11:44.483
The Army's charging that McCarthy
and Cohn exercised undue pressure...

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:47.945
...to get preferential treatment
for Schine. - Who's the source?

01:11:48.028 --> 01:11:52.074
- Got a second source? - There isn't,
but this is coming out in 2 hours.

01:11:52.157 --> 01:11:55.494
- Who's heading up the investigation?
- It's not gonna be McCarthy!

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:57.371
- Really?
- What happened?

01:11:57.538 --> 01:12:00.415
- Also get me the Washington Post!
- What's going on?

01:12:00.499 --> 01:12:02.000
It's Williams
for Jack Thompson.

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:03.877
The Senate's investigating McCarthy.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:06.838
There is an added bit of comedy
to this whole story.

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.924
The Committee cannot convene
for several days...

01:12:09.007 --> 01:12:11.760
...because Senator McCarthy
has a slight case of laryngitis.

01:12:11.843 --> 01:12:15.722
And he must recover
over the desert air of Arizona.

01:12:19.017 --> 01:12:22.562
- But Stevens is going after him
and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah.

01:12:22.646 --> 01:12:25.065
They're gonna allow each side
to call witnesses...

01:12:25.148 --> 01:12:26.983
...and be privy to other testimony.

01:12:27.275 --> 01:12:31.154
- Fred, we still have a meeting!
- We're gonna go to talk to Thompson.

01:12:33.698 --> 01:12:35.200
No, thanks, Jack. Bye.

01:12:36.076 --> 01:12:39.037
Freddy, we're a hit.
Right up there with "Howdy Dowdy"!

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:42.332
Can I have
an outlet satellite, please?

01:12:44.167 --> 01:12:50.799
- 74, 76, 47. Thank you.
- Murrayville 3, 1-2-7-6.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:13.947
The fact of newscaster
Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday...

01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:17.992
...does not remove from the record
that peculiar history...

01:13:18.701 --> 01:13:23.748
...of the leftist slanting of news
indulged consistently by the CBS.

01:13:25.124 --> 01:13:28.378
Hollenbeck was what most astute
students of CBS's strange...

01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:31.047
...and questionable new methods
considered...

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:36.719
..."typical of its newscasters".
By Jack O'Brian.

01:15:10.938 --> 01:15:12.981
Oh, yeah. I like it like that.

01:15:15.233 --> 01:15:19.154
One of the best programs I ever heard
was called "CBS Views The Press".

01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:22.324
A great many people liked it,
some didn't...

01:15:22.699 --> 01:15:25.327
...but no one ever called it
anything but honest.

01:15:25.744 --> 01:15:29.539
It was the work of an honest reporter.
Don Hollenbeck.

01:15:30.499 --> 01:15:32.876
He also worked occasionally
on "See It Now".

01:15:33.585 --> 01:15:36.421
He did the 11 p.m. News
over some of these stations.

01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:39.841
He had been sick lately
and he died this morning.

01:15:40.425 --> 01:15:43.011
The police said
it was suicide... gas.

01:15:44.721 --> 01:15:46.014
Not much of an obit.

01:15:46.473 --> 01:15:49.643
But, at least we got our facts
straight, and it was brief.

01:15:50.685 --> 01:15:53.229
And that's all Don Hollenbeck
would have asked.

01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:55.982
Good night, and good luck.

01:16:01.613 --> 01:16:03.740
Got to be in Philadelphia
this morning.

01:16:04.824 --> 01:16:06.326
What time is your train?

01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:08.411
8:00.

01:16:09.996 --> 01:16:12.582
- Charlie going with you?
- Uh-huh.

01:16:21.591 --> 01:16:22.800
Here's a thought.

01:16:24.636 --> 01:16:26.012
What if we're wrong?

01:16:28.681 --> 01:16:29.933
We're not wrong.

01:16:31.643 --> 01:16:33.353
We're not going to look back...

01:16:35.396 --> 01:16:37.523
...and say we protected
the wrong side?

01:16:39.942 --> 01:16:45.281
Protected them from what? In the name
of what? What would we be preserving?

01:16:46.407 --> 01:16:49.827
Argument could be made,
"for the greater good".

01:16:52.079 --> 01:16:54.790
Not once you give it all away.
It's no good then.

01:16:56.501 --> 01:16:57.877
It's just a thought.

01:17:04.592 --> 01:17:09.347
Senator, may we not drop this? We know
he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild.

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:12.016
And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.

01:17:12.224 --> 01:17:16.062
- I did you, I think, no personal
injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir.

01:17:16.145 --> 01:17:18.773
- I meant to do you
no personal injury. - No.

01:17:18.939 --> 01:17:22.026
And if I did, I beg your pardon.

01:17:22.443 --> 01:17:27.907
Let us not assassinate this lad
further, Senator. You've done enough.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.785
- Let's... let's...
- Have you no sense of decency, sir?

01:17:31.994 --> 01:17:37.124
At long last, have you left
no sense of decency?

01:17:37.499 --> 01:17:41.503
- I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.
- Senator, I think it hurts you, too.

01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:45.132
- I'd like to finish this.
- Have you some private reservation...

01:17:45.215 --> 01:17:49.011
...when you take the oath
that you will tell the whole truth...

01:17:49.386 --> 01:17:52.556
...that lets you be the judge
of what you will testify to?

01:17:52.723 --> 01:17:56.352
The answer is there's no reservation
about telling the whole truth.

01:17:56.518 --> 01:18:01.857
Thank you, sir. Then tell us
who delivered the documents to you!

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.985
I don't want to mean that
this new fashion is not chic.

01:18:05.068 --> 01:18:08.822
- I think it's just no good for me.
- Uh, not for you.

01:18:09.114 --> 01:18:11.825
Milko, anything you care to say
on that subject?

01:18:11.909 --> 01:18:13.285
I think no comment.

01:18:16.914 --> 01:18:20.292
It's got to be there. If you can't
find it, I can't write about it.

01:18:20.375 --> 01:18:22.794
- Check again.
- Charlie said he dropped it off.

01:18:22.878 --> 01:18:26.048
- Charlie said he dropped...
- Shirley, can I see you a minute?

01:18:26.256 --> 01:18:27.883
- I got to call you back.
- Joe!

01:18:28.008 --> 01:18:29.009
You, too.

01:18:39.311 --> 01:18:40.395
Close the door.

01:18:43.648 --> 01:18:44.733
Have a seat.

01:18:48.361 --> 01:18:51.489
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah.

01:18:52.157 --> 01:18:55.243
Uh, you both are aware
that there's a policy at CBS...

01:18:55.327 --> 01:18:57.454
...that no two employees
can be married.

01:19:00.248 --> 01:19:03.668
I want to ask you a question,
but I don't want you to answer it.

01:19:03.752 --> 01:19:05.503
I want you to consider it.

01:19:06.671 --> 01:19:08.340
I know you two are married.

01:19:10.425 --> 01:19:11.551
Everyone knows.

01:19:12.719 --> 01:19:14.012
That's not my question.

01:19:14.387 --> 01:19:17.474
In the next few weeks
I have to lay off a couple of people.

01:19:17.557 --> 01:19:20.393
We're making some significant cuts
across the board.

01:19:21.686 --> 01:19:23.313
I wanted you to know that...

01:19:23.521 --> 01:19:26.482
...because you could save
someone else being fired.

01:19:28.651 --> 01:19:32.530
I'm asking you to consider
making this decision a little easier.

01:19:34.866 --> 01:19:36.534
I don't need an answer now.

01:19:38.077 --> 01:19:40.121
Just think about it.

01:19:41.789 --> 01:19:42.790
Good.

01:19:54.719 --> 01:19:55.970
- Well, Joe...
- Well?

01:19:56.387 --> 01:19:59.599
- Sure we're gonna miss you
around here. - I'll pack my things.

01:20:02.852 --> 01:20:05.563
- I think it's for the best.
- We'll find out!

01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.483
Mrs. Wershba...

01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:13.529
Everybody knew.

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.540
Natalie, did he say
what it was about?

01:20:24.623 --> 01:20:27.501
No. Just that he wanted to talk
to you in his office.

01:20:43.225 --> 01:20:44.351
Uh-oh!

01:20:47.771 --> 01:20:51.233
The problem isn't simply
that you've lost your sponsor.

01:20:51.609 --> 01:20:53.944
With Alcoa, "See It Now"
still loses money.

01:20:54.028 --> 01:20:55.404
The fee is 50,000 dollars.

01:20:55.487 --> 01:20:58.073
Last week's episode we did
for less than 50,000 dollars.

01:20:58.157 --> 01:21:00.075
Fred, you're speaking
beyond your competence.

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:02.578
We'll certainly find another sponsor.

01:21:02.661 --> 01:21:06.373
"64,000 Dollar Question" brings in
over 80,000 in sponsors...

01:21:06.457 --> 01:21:08.667
...and it costs one-third
of what you do.

01:21:08.751 --> 01:21:11.753
Ed, I've got Tuesday night
programming that's number one.

01:21:11.837 --> 01:21:15.299
People want to enjoy themselves.
They don't want a civics lesson.

01:21:15.382 --> 01:21:18.302
- What do you want, Bill?
- I don't want to get a stomachache...

01:21:18.385 --> 01:21:20.888
...every time you take on
a controversial subject.

01:21:22.598 --> 01:21:25.684
I'm afraid that's the price
you have to be willing to pay.

01:21:27.102 --> 01:21:30.063
Let's walk very carefully
through these next few moments.

01:21:30.147 --> 01:21:32.566
The content of what we're doing
is more important...

01:21:32.649 --> 01:21:36.028
...than what some guy in Cincinnati...
- It's what you're doing, Ed. Not me.

01:21:36.111 --> 01:21:37.237
Not Frank Stanton. You.

01:21:37.612 --> 01:21:41.616
"CBS News", "See It Now"
all belong to you, Bill.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.826
You wouldn't know it.

01:21:44.578 --> 01:21:49.374
- What is it you want? Credit?
- I never censored a single program.

01:21:50.333 --> 01:21:54.754
I hold on to affiliates
who wanted entertainment from us.

01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:56.923
I fight to keep the license...

01:21:57.007 --> 01:22:00.385
...with the very same politicians
that you are bringing down...

01:22:00.468 --> 01:22:05.515
...and I never,
never said no to you. Never.

01:22:06.891 --> 01:22:10.020
I would argue that we have done
very well by one another.

01:22:11.146 --> 01:22:13.064
I would argue that this network...

01:22:14.315 --> 01:22:17.360
...is defined by what the news
department has accomplished.

01:22:17.444 --> 01:22:21.489
And I would also argue that never saying
no is not the same as not censoring.

01:22:21.573 --> 01:22:24.742
Really? You should teach journalism.
You and Mr. Friendly.

01:22:31.124 --> 01:22:32.458
Let me ask you this:

01:22:34.168 --> 01:22:35.962
...why didn't you correct McCarthy...

01:22:36.045 --> 01:22:39.090
...when he said that Alger Hiss
was convicted of treason?

01:22:39.299 --> 01:22:42.969
He was only convicted of perjury.
You corrected everything else.

01:22:43.636 --> 01:22:46.848
Did you not want the appearance
of defending a known Communist?

01:22:46.931 --> 01:22:49.767
I would argue that everyone censors,
including you.

01:22:53.771 --> 01:22:55.481
What do you want to do, Bill?

01:22:59.485 --> 01:23:02.447
I'm taking your program
from a half an hour to an hour.

01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:06.033
And it won't be a weekly program
and it won't be Tuesday nights.

01:23:06.659 --> 01:23:09.036
- When would it be?
- Sunday afternoons.

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:14.834
- How many episodes?
- 5.

01:23:17.587 --> 01:23:19.505
Why don't you just fire me, Bill?

01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:22.008
I don't think
it's what either of us wants.

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:27.847
You owe me 5 shows.

01:23:37.857 --> 01:23:40.484
- You won't like the subject matter.
- Probably not.

01:23:40.651 --> 01:23:42.820
Fred, I'll need you for a moment.

01:23:57.543 --> 01:23:59.878
- Thank you, Mary.
- Goodbye, Mr. Friendly.

01:24:06.093 --> 01:24:09.430
- He wants me to lay a few people off.
- I'm sure he does.

01:24:09.596 --> 01:24:12.641
Let's do our first show
about the downfall of television.

01:24:15.769 --> 01:24:19.189
- Senate's gonna vote to censure
McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably.

01:24:19.273 --> 01:24:22.484
- And then what happens?
- He sits in the back row. - Right.

01:24:22.818 --> 01:24:27.030
- They keep him in the Senate.
They don't kick him out. - No, he stays.

01:24:37.666 --> 01:24:39.876
Well, we might as well
go down swinging.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.800
Did you know the most trusted man
in America is Milton Berle?

01:24:46.883 --> 01:24:48.844
See, you should have worn a dress!

01:24:50.554 --> 01:24:53.181
- How does a Scotch sound?
- Scotch sounds good.

01:24:54.224 --> 01:24:56.768
- Did you know Joe and Shirley
were married? - Sure.

01:24:56.852 --> 01:24:58.895
- Did everyone know?
- Pretty much.

01:24:58.979 --> 01:25:01.773
We are proud because
from the beginning of this nation...

01:25:02.232 --> 01:25:03.692
...man can walk upright.

01:25:06.403 --> 01:25:08.655
No matter who he is
or who she is.

01:25:09.531 --> 01:25:13.493
He can walk upright
and meet his friend or his enemy.

01:25:14.369 --> 01:25:17.414
And he does not fear
that because that enemy...

01:25:18.373 --> 01:25:20.542
...may be in a position
of great power...

01:25:21.501 --> 01:25:26.297
...that he can be suddenly
thrown in jail...

01:25:27.841 --> 01:25:31.344
...to rot there without charges
and with no recourse to justice.

01:25:33.388 --> 01:25:36.474
We have the Habeas Corpus Act
and we respect it.

01:25:37.308 --> 01:25:40.520
I began by saying that our history
will be what we make it.

01:25:41.271 --> 01:25:42.814
If we go on as we are...

01:25:43.106 --> 01:25:46.693
...then history will take its revenge,
and retribution will not limp...

01:25:46.776 --> 01:25:48.194
...in catching up with us.

01:25:49.696 --> 01:25:53.700
Just once in a while, let us exalt the
importance of ideas and information.

01:25:55.076 --> 01:25:58.538
Let us dream to the extent of saying
that on a given Sunday night...

01:25:58.621 --> 01:26:00.873
...the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan...

01:26:00.957 --> 01:26:04.752
...is given over to a clinical survey
on the state of American education.

01:26:04.836 --> 01:26:08.256
And a week or two later, the time
normally used by Steve Allen...

01:26:08.339 --> 01:26:12.635
...is devoted to a thorough-going study
of American policy in the Middle East.

01:26:13.594 --> 01:26:17.139
Would the corporate image of their
respective sponsors be damaged?

01:26:17.431 --> 01:26:20.643
Would the shareholders rise up
in their wrath and complain?

01:26:21.435 --> 01:26:22.436
Would anything happen...

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.315
...other than a few million people would
have received a little illumination...

01:26:26.399 --> 01:26:29.652
...on subjects that may well determine
the future of this country...

01:26:29.735 --> 01:26:32.238
...and therefore the future
of the corporations?

01:26:32.989 --> 01:26:36.409
To those who say, "People wouldn't
look, they wouldn't be interested..."

01:26:36.492 --> 01:26:39.495
"...they're too complacent,
indifferent and insulated"...

01:26:39.703 --> 01:26:43.582
...I can only reply: There is,
in one reporter's opinion...

01:26:44.041 --> 01:26:46.669
...considerable evidence
against that contention.

01:26:47.711 --> 01:26:50.714
But even if they are right,
what have they got to lose?

01:26:50.965 --> 01:26:52.550
Because if they are right...

01:26:52.633 --> 01:26:54.677
...and this instrument
is good for nothing...

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.304
...but to entertain,
amuse and insulate...

01:26:58.013 --> 01:26:59.890
...then the tube is flickering now...

01:26:59.974 --> 01:27:03.060
...and we will soon see
that the whole struggle is lost.

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:05.562
This instrument can teach.

01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:08.482
It can illuminate
and it can even inspire.

01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:13.237
But it can do so only to the extent
that humans are determined to use it...

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.738
...towards those ends.

01:27:16.156 --> 01:27:18.742
Otherwise,
it is merely wires and lights...

01:27:19.451 --> 01:27:20.619
...in a box.

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:26.166
Good night, and good luck.
