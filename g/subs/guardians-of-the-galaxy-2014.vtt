WEBVTT

00:35.080 --> 00:36.120
Peter.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.560
Your momma wants to speak with you.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.800
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.840
Why have you been fighting
with the other boys again, baby?

01:26.480 --> 01:27.680
Peter?

01:28.280 --> 01:31.440
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.560
Smushed it with a stick.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.320
You're so like your daddy.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.840
You even look like him.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.320
And he was an angel.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.400
-Composed out of pure light.
-Mer?

01:48.520 --> 01:50.480
You got a present there for Peter,
don't you?

01:52.400 --> 01:53.880
Of course.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.320
There.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.720
I've got you covered, Pete.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.120
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.200
-Your grandpa...
-

02:13.120 --> 02:15.640
...is gonna take such good care of you.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.600
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

02:23.480 --> 02:24.480
Take my hand.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.680
Peter.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.360
-Pete, come on.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.440
Take my hand.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.520
PETER: Mom?

02:41.920 --> 02:44.800
No! No! No! No!

02:44.920 --> 02:46.360
Mom! No!

02:46.480 --> 02:47.920
-Come with me.
-No!

02:48.200 --> 02:49.800
No!

02:50.480 --> 02:51.760
You've got to stay here. Please.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.360
No...

02:54.640 --> 02:56.240
Okay?

03:15.520 --> 03:16.720
No.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.960
Mom!

08:25.240 --> 08:26.640
Drop it!

08:26.920 --> 08:28.080
Uh, hey.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.880
-Drop it, now!
-Hey, cool, man. No problem.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.960
No problem at all.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.280
How do you know about this?

08:36.520 --> 08:37.960
PETER: I don't even know what that is.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.640
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.120
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.640
This is just an outfit, man.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.080
Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
What is your name?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.280
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.080
-Move!
-Why?

08:51.160 --> 08:53.120
Ronan may have questions for you.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.720
PETER: Hey, you know what?

08:54.840 --> 08:56.960
There's another name
you might know me by.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.640
Star-Lord.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
Who?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.200
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.800
-Guys?
-Move!

09:08.760 --> 09:10.880
Ah, forget this.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.160
WOMAN: Peter?

11:07.120 --> 11:08.120
What happened?

11:08.920 --> 11:10.680
Hey, uh...

11:10.760 --> 11:12.800
Uh... I...

11:13.760 --> 11:15.440
-Bereet.
-Bereet!

11:15.760 --> 11:18.080
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.720
REPORTER ON TV:
Scattered riots broke out

11:43.800 --> 11:45.200
across the Kree Empire today

11:45.280 --> 11:48.880
protesting the recent peace treaty
signed by the Kree Emperor

11:48.960 --> 11:51.280
and Xandar's Nova Prime.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.240
Peter, you have call.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.840
-No, wait, don't!
-Quill?

12:00.240 --> 12:01.480
Hey, Yondu.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.800
I'm here on Morag.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.040
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.280
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.760
Well, where are you at now, boy?

12:08.840 --> 12:11.320
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.000
-I slaved putting this deal together.
-Slaved?

12:14.080 --> 12:15.120
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

12:15.200 --> 12:16.200
And now you're gonna rip me off!

12:16.320 --> 12:19.880
We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.720
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

12:22.840 --> 12:24.120
When I picked you up on Terra...

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
"Picked me up."

12:25.320 --> 12:26.240
...these boys of mine
wanted to eat you.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.320
Yeah?

12:27.400 --> 12:28.840
They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.120
I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!

12:31.200 --> 12:32.400
I will find you, I will...

12:33.200 --> 12:34.880
Put a bounty on him!

12:35.360 --> 12:36.520
Forty K.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.240
-But I want him back alive.
-Yeah, Cap.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.920
-Alive?
-That's what I said.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.280
I told you when you picked that kid up,

12:41.400 --> 12:43.360
you should have delivered him
like we was hired to do!

12:43.480 --> 12:45.080
He was cargo!

12:45.200 --> 12:46.880
You have always been soft on him.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.400
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

12:50.000 --> 12:52.360
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.960
As soon as we get him back here,

12:55.400 --> 12:57.920
I'm gonna kill him myself.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.520
What we do need to worry about,

13:01.040 --> 13:03.360
is who else out there wants that Orb!

13:23.880 --> 13:26.080
RONAN: They call me "terrorist,"

13:26.800 --> 13:29.320
"radical," "zealot,"

13:30.200 --> 13:33.320
because I obey the ancient laws
of my people, the Kree,

13:34.240 --> 13:37.520
and punish those who do not.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.920
Because I do not forgive your people

13:41.040 --> 13:43.440
for taking the life of my father,

13:44.120 --> 13:47.480
and his father,
and his father before him.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.360
A thousand years of war between us
will not be forgotten!

13:53.920 --> 13:56.600
XANDARIAN: You can't do this!
Our government signed a peace treaty.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.160
RONAN: My government
knows no shame.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.080
You Xandarians and your culture
are a disease.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.440
You

14:06.560 --> 14:08.960
will never rule Xandar.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.080
No.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.120
I will cure it!

14:26.280 --> 14:27.320
Ronan,

14:27.440 --> 14:29.320
Korath has returned.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.280
KORATH: Master, he is a thief,

14:32.880 --> 14:34.920
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.400
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

14:37.520 --> 14:40.320
to retrieve the Orb
for an intermediary known

14:40.480 --> 14:42.040
as The Broker.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.520
I promised Thanos
I would retrieve the Orb for him.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.240
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.480
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.440
It will be my honor.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.560
It will be your doom.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.360
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

14:59.480 --> 15:01.240
without his prize.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.960
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.480
Just like you.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.000
But I know Xandar.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.640
Ronan has already decreed that I...

15:07.960 --> 15:08.960
Do not speak for me.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.320
You will not fail.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.640
Have I ever?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.520
ROCKET: Xandarians.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.000
What a bunch of losers.

15:38.080 --> 15:42.400
All of them in a big hurry
to get from something stupid,

15:42.600 --> 15:44.520
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
Look at this guy!

15:46.160 --> 15:47.600
Can you believe they call us criminals,

15:47.680 --> 15:49.600
when he's assaulting us
with that haircut?

15:50.200 --> 15:53.040
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.560
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.640
-Look at Mr. Smiles over here.
-

15:59.360 --> 16:03.120
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.280
Right, Groot?

16:05.720 --> 16:06.960
Groot?

16:07.040 --> 16:08.720
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.200
-That's disgusting!
-Mmm.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.480
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.680
Why are you lying?

16:14.960 --> 16:16.240
-Whoop.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.320
Looks like we got one.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.440
Okay, humie, how bad
does someone wanna find you?

16:26.040 --> 16:30.160
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.440
-Mr. Quill.
-Broker.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
The Orb.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.760
-As commissioned.
-Where's Yondu?

16:52.040 --> 16:53.600
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

16:53.720 --> 16:54.720
And told me to tell you,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.200
that you got the best eyebrows
in the business.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.400
What is it?

17:01.200 --> 17:04.480
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.560
Yeah, well, I almost died
getting it for you.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.600
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.560
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.040
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.160
I truly am.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.800
But I want no part of this transaction

17:19.040 --> 17:20.800
-if Ronan is involved.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:21.800 --> 17:23.120
Who's Ronan?

17:23.240 --> 17:26.400
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

17:26.520 --> 17:30.760
who will not rest
until Xandarian culture, my culture,

17:31.040 --> 17:32.160
-is wiped from existence!
-Whoa, whoa!

17:32.240 --> 17:33.560
-Come on.
-He's someone

17:33.680 --> 17:35.120
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.800
What? What about my bad side?

17:37.080 --> 17:38.320
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.120
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

17:48.160 --> 17:49.200
What happened?

17:51.400 --> 17:54.320
Ah, this guy just backed out of a deal
on me.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.520
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a man without integrity.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.400
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.200
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.400
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.160
People say it about me, all the time,

18:08.280 --> 18:09.680
but it's not something
I would ever say about myself.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.200
-

18:11.560 --> 18:12.680
-Ooh!
-

18:28.520 --> 18:29.640
This wasn't the plan.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.600
Ah!

18:32.280 --> 18:34.400
ROCKET: Put him in the bag.
Put him in the bag!

18:34.520 --> 18:36.720
No! Not her, him!

18:36.880 --> 18:38.360
Learn genders, man.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.160
-Ow!

18:40.240 --> 18:41.840
Biting? That's not fair!

18:45.360 --> 18:47.120
-ROCKET: Take it easy!
-

18:53.640 --> 18:54.720
Ow!

19:15.720 --> 19:17.440
Fool. You should have learned.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.400
I don't learn. One of my issues.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.680
PETER: What the...

19:32.920 --> 19:36.160
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.800
You gotta be kidding me.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.640
Ooh. Hey!

19:58.400 --> 20:00.720
I live for the simple things.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.240
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.880
-

20:07.960 --> 20:09.960
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.640
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.360
Quit whining.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.800
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.960
Aw, crap.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.600
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

20:30.680 --> 20:32.520
-you are under arrest...
-All right. Come on up.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.720
...for endangerment to life
and the destruction of property.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.920
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

20:38.240 --> 20:41.400
-Star-Lord.
-Oh, sorry. "Lord."

20:41.520 --> 20:43.560
I picked this guy up a while back
for petty theft.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.240
-He's got a code name.
-

20:45.320 --> 20:46.320
OFFICER: Yeah. Stay out of the way.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.280
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.920
Just relax, pal.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.360
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.360
ROCKET: Fascists.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.840
NOVA PRIME: Ronan is destroying

21:09.920 --> 21:12.280
Xandarian outposts
throughout the galaxy.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.360
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

21:16.760 --> 21:17.960
We signed your peace treaty,
Nova Prime.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.400
What more do you want?

21:19.520 --> 21:21.280
At least a statement
from the Kree Empire

21:21.360 --> 21:23.560
saying that they condemn his actions.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.040
He is slaughtering children.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.680
Families.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.040
That is your business.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.320
Now, I have other matters to attend to.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.680
Prick.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.400
-Well, some good news.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.560
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.040
DEY: Gamora.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.320
Surgically modified
and trained as a living weapon.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.840
The adopted daughter
of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.480
Recently, Thanos lent her
and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

21:52.600 --> 21:55.760
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

21:55.880 --> 22:00.080
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

22:00.480 --> 22:01.760
The result of illegal genetic

22:01.880 --> 22:03.440
and cybernetic experiments

22:03.520 --> 22:04.720
-on a lower life form.
-

22:05.040 --> 22:06.840
What the hell?

22:07.360 --> 22:08.760
DEY: They call it "Groot."

22:08.920 --> 22:11.440
A humanoid plant
that's been travelling recently

22:11.520 --> 22:14.680
as 89P13's
personal houseplant/muscle.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.800
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
Raised from youth by a band
of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

22:22.320 --> 22:23.920
led by Yondu Udonta.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.680
I didn't know how this machine worked.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.880
-What a bunch of a-holes.
-

22:31.520 --> 22:33.880
SAAL: Transport all four to the Kyln.

22:36.760 --> 22:40.080
ROCKET: I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

22:40.400 --> 22:43.680
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.000
But, hey, that's not my problem.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.800
I ain't gonna be here long.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.440
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.800
You're lucky the broad showed up,

22:52.880 --> 22:54.040
because otherwise, me and Groot

22:54.120 --> 22:55.960
would be collecting that bounty
right now,

22:56.040 --> 22:57.960
and you'd be getting
drawn and quartered

22:58.120 --> 22:59.040
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.480
I've had a lot of folks
try to kill me over the years.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.400
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.480
Hold.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.480
-What's a raccoon?
-PETER: "What's a raccoon?"

23:07.600 --> 23:08.800
It's what you are, stupid.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.720
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.680
So, this Orb has
a real shiny blue suitcase,

23:14.760 --> 23:17.800
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.720
-What is it?
-I am Groot.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.560
So what? What's the Orb?

23:21.680 --> 23:23.840
I have no words for an honorless thief.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.120
Pretty high and mighty
coming from the lackey

23:26.440 --> 23:27.520
of a genocidal maniac.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.520
Yeah, I know who you are.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.600
Anyone who's anyone
knows who you are.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.160
Yeah, we know who you are.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.800
-Who is she?
-I am Groot.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.840
Yeah, you said that.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.000
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.840
I was betraying him.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I had an agreement
to sell it to a third party.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.440
I am Groot.

23:48.560 --> 23:52.760
Well, that's just as fascinating
as the first 89 times you told me that.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.880
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.440
Well, he don't know
talking good like me and you.

23:57.520 --> 24:01.560
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

24:01.640 --> 24:03.160
Exclusively in that order.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.600
I tell you what,
that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.120
Hey.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.520
Put that away.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.840
-Hey!

24:11.920 --> 24:14.120
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.960
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.960
That tape and that player is mine!

24:18.040 --> 24:19.920
-

24:21.680 --> 24:24.600
Hooked on a Feeling,
Blue Swede, 1973.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.040
That song belongs to me!

24:26.120 --> 24:27.800
-

25:45.880 --> 25:48.800
-You first! You first!
-Murderer!

25:49.160 --> 25:51.800
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

25:51.880 --> 25:56.080
-You're scum! You're scum!
-

25:59.040 --> 26:00.160
It's like I said,

26:00.320 --> 26:02.200
she's got a rep.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.160
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

26:04.320 --> 26:06.560
to Ronan and his goons.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.800
She'll last a day, tops.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.120
Murderer!

26:09.640 --> 26:10.760
The guards will protect her, right?

26:11.160 --> 26:13.320
They're here to stop us from getting out.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.600
They don't care
what we do to each other inside.

26:15.760 --> 26:19.120
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

26:19.240 --> 26:22.960
are dreams
compared to what's behind me.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.840
Check out the new meat.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.720
I'm gonna slather you up
in Gunavian jelly,

26:30.840 --> 26:32.080
and go to town...

26:36.800 --> 26:38.640
Let's make something clear.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.800
This one here is our booty!

26:43.360 --> 26:45.200
You wanna get to him,

26:45.880 --> 26:47.680
you go through us!

26:48.360 --> 26:50.800
Or, more accurately,

26:51.200 --> 26:53.680
-we go through you.
-

27:03.720 --> 27:05.360
I'm with them.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.720
INMATE: I hate you.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.960
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

27:24.280 --> 27:25.800
-You're dead!

27:26.240 --> 27:27.240
Dead!

27:53.680 --> 27:55.000
GUARD: Take her down to the showers.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.160
It'll be easier to clean up
the blood down there.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.240
Quill, where you going?

28:13.680 --> 28:14.720
Quill.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.360
-Quill!
-

28:17.440 --> 28:21.000
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

28:21.120 --> 28:23.200
for your crimes against the galaxy.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.440
DRAX: You dare?

28:30.800 --> 28:32.720
You know who I am, yes?

28:33.280 --> 28:34.720
PRISONER: You're Drax.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.920
The Destroyer.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.040
Quill!

28:38.120 --> 28:40.040
DRAX: And you know
why they call me this.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.800
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.280
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

28:46.840 --> 28:48.800
and my daughter, Camaria.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.320
He slaughtered them where they stood.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.080
And he laughed!

28:54.160 --> 28:55.120
ROCKET: Quill?

28:55.200 --> 28:56.320
DRAX: Her life

28:57.160 --> 28:59.120
is not yours to take.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.120
He killed my family.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.000
I shall kill one of his in return.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.360
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

29:11.840 --> 29:13.120
-

29:15.280 --> 29:16.800
Quill! What are you doing?

29:17.200 --> 29:20.440
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.840
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.760
-Ah!

29:33.840 --> 29:36.360
Woman, your words
mean nothing to me!

29:36.520 --> 29:39.120
-Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
-Oh, crap.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.360
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

29:41.440 --> 29:42.920
I don't think this is
the best way to go about it.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.520
Are you not the man
this wench attempted to kill?

29:46.880 --> 29:48.040
Well, I mean,
she's hardly the first woman

29:49.200 --> 29:52.360
Look, this is from
a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.040
Stabbed me with a fork.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.120
Didn't like me skipping out on her
at sunrise.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.840
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.960
She caught me with
this skinny little A'askavariian

30:01.040 --> 30:02.080
who worked in Nova Records.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.840
I was trying to get information.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.480
You ever see an A'askavariian?

30:05.560 --> 30:07.400
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.920
If you think I'm seriously interested
in that, then...

30:10.880 --> 30:13.400
-You don't care. But here's the point.
-

30:15.160 --> 30:18.040
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.840
And when he does,

30:20.320 --> 30:22.200
that's when you...

30:23.200 --> 30:25.920
Why would I put
my finger on his throat?

30:26.240 --> 30:27.280
What?

30:29.440 --> 30:30.480
Oh, no, it's a symbol.

30:30.560 --> 30:35.000
This is a symbol
for you slicing his throat.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.360
I would not slice his throat.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.240
I would cut his head clean off.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.440
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.160
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

30:44.240 --> 30:45.280
-You know what that is.
-Yeah. Yeah.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.440
-Everyone knows.
-No, no.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.480
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.560
Don't do his work for him.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.080
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.240
-That was my favorite knife.
-PETER: Listen!

31:14.360 --> 31:17.440
I could care less
whether you live or whether you die.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.320
-Then why stop the big guy?
-Simple.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.160
You know where to sell my Orb.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.480
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

31:25.880 --> 31:26.960
My friend Rocket, here,

31:27.400 --> 31:28.640
has escaped 22 prisons.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.480
Oh, we're getting out.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.480
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.320
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

31:38.640 --> 31:40.000
Four billion units.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.520
-What?
-Holy shit.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.480
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.480
If you free us,

31:49.440 --> 31:50.960
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

31:51.040 --> 31:52.640
and I'll split the profit
between the three of us.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.480
I am Groot.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.080
ROCKET: Four of us.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
Asleep for the danger,
awake for the money,

31:58.280 --> 31:59.280
as per frickin' usual.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.640
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.000
We know only that
she has been captured.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.040
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

32:09.120 --> 32:13.400
No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.200
Look, your partnership with Thanos

32:16.320 --> 32:18.120
is at risk.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.520
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

32:28.480 --> 32:32.200
RONAN: With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

32:32.280 --> 32:33.720
and yet you summon me.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.720
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.000
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.720
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.640
RONAN: Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.640
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

32:44.720 --> 32:48.960
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

32:49.040 --> 32:50.240
Lower your tone!

32:50.400 --> 32:51.400
I may be your...

32:59.560 --> 33:03.480
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.360
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

33:08.680 --> 33:10.080
is you.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.280
Your politics bore me.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.480
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

33:16.560 --> 33:21.320
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.760
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

33:27.040 --> 33:28.680
if you bring me the Orb.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.240
But return to me again empty-handed,

33:32.680 --> 33:35.600
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.760
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

33:43.240 --> 33:46.040
This is one fight you won't win.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.760
Let's head to the Kyln.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.520
ROCKET: If we're gonna get out of here,

33:58.640 --> 34:00.400
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.280
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.800
The guards wear security bands

34:05.120 --> 34:07.440
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.280
Leave it to me.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.240
ROCKET: That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.080
PETER: His leg?
ROCKET: Yeah.

34:14.240 --> 34:16.280
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.640
All right.

34:17.800 --> 34:22.160
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.280
-Do you see it?
-Yeah.

34:24.360 --> 34:28.440
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.640
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.240
How are we supposed to do that?

34:32.320 --> 34:34.560
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.320
So, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.520
You must be joking.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.400
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.200
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

34:41.280 --> 34:43.600
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.480
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.600
I got one plan,

34:47.680 --> 34:49.760
and that plan requires
a frickin' quarnyx battery,

34:49.840 --> 34:51.080
so figure it out!

34:51.160 --> 34:52.240
Oh!

34:52.440 --> 34:54.360
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.360
Now, this is important.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.080
Once the battery is removed,

34:58.160 --> 35:00.480
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.320
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

35:03.400 --> 35:06.320
so you definitely need to get that last.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.160
Or we could just get it first
and improvise.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.320
-I'll get the armband.
-Leg.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.360
GUARD: Prisoner,

35:29.560 --> 35:32.400
drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

35:32.520 --> 35:34.400
or we will open fire.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.480
I am

35:42.600 --> 35:45.400
Groot!

35:45.520 --> 35:46.800
Fire!

35:59.480 --> 36:01.760
All prisoners return
to your sleeping areas.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.760
You idiot!

36:08.840 --> 36:11.640
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.440
The animal is in control.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.600
Fire on my command!

36:40.960 --> 36:42.440
Creepy little beast!

36:48.880 --> 36:51.960
Oh, yeah.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.760
You need my what?

37:21.880 --> 37:23.480
-I'll need this.
-Good luck.

37:23.680 --> 37:24.960
It's internally wired.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.880
Drop the leg!

37:31.960 --> 37:34.640
Drop the leg
and move back to your cell!

37:49.560 --> 37:50.840
GAMORA: Rocket!

37:53.680 --> 37:56.000
Move to the watchtower!

38:26.960 --> 38:28.000
You!

38:29.000 --> 38:30.680
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

38:32.000 --> 38:34.080
It was one time, man.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.520
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

38:53.840 --> 38:54.920
Whoa!

38:55.800 --> 38:57.000
-

39:00.880 --> 39:02.440
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

39:03.560 --> 39:04.600
Why is this one here?

39:05.040 --> 39:07.600
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.920
I always keep my promises,

39:09.000 --> 39:10.680
when they're
to muscle-bound whack-jobs

39:10.760 --> 39:11.960
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.520
Oh, I was just kidding about the leg.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.680
I just need these two things.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.520
-What?
-No, I thought it'd be funny.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.640
Was it funny?

39:18.760 --> 39:20.520
Oh, wait, what did he look like
hopping around?

39:20.600 --> 39:22.520
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

39:25.440 --> 39:26.560
DRAX: How are we going to leave?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.040
Well, he's got a plan.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.880
Right? Or is that
another thing you made up?

39:31.960 --> 39:33.640
I have a plan! I have a plan!

39:33.760 --> 39:35.400
Cease your yammering

39:35.520 --> 39:36.960
and relieve us
from this irksome confinement.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.600
Yeah, I'll have to agree
with the walking thesaurus

39:38.720 --> 39:40.520
on that one.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.960
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

39:43.800 --> 39:44.840
It's just a metaphor, dude.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.880
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.640
Nothing goes over my head.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.840
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.480
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.880
Those are some big guns.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.480
On my command!

40:08.400 --> 40:09.400
Number one!

40:11.160 --> 40:12.160
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.120
Hold on!

40:15.160 --> 40:17.000
Number two!

40:17.880 --> 40:19.720
I recognize this animal.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.960
We'd roast them over a flame pit
as children.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.440
Their flesh was quite delicious.

40:23.560 --> 40:24.680
Not helping!

40:24.840 --> 40:25.840
Number three!

40:31.960 --> 40:34.720
All fire on my command!

40:35.040 --> 40:36.160
Three!

40:36.720 --> 40:37.880
Two!

40:38.440 --> 40:39.560
One!

40:53.880 --> 40:55.720
GAMORA:
He turned off the artificial gravity,

40:55.840 --> 40:57.800
everywhere but in here.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.040
-

41:36.560 --> 41:38.480
I told you I had a plan.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.280
That was a pretty good plan.

42:02.760 --> 42:03.800
Huh?

42:13.760 --> 42:14.960
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

42:15.240 --> 42:17.960
It's the Milano, the orange and blue one
over in the corner.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.840
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.960
That's rude! They folded yours.

42:30.200 --> 42:32.120
The Orb's there. Let's go.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.920
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What?

42:35.000 --> 42:36.800
That bastard didn't put it back.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.800
-Put what back?
-Here.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.680
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.240
-How are you gonna possibly...
-Just keep the Milano close by.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.720
Go.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.080
Go!

43:07.280 --> 43:09.160
Ah, my neck!

43:13.920 --> 43:15.160
ROCKET: Well,
how's he gonna get to us?

43:15.720 --> 43:17.680
GAMORA: He declined to share
that information with me.

43:17.760 --> 43:18.760
Well, screw this, then!

43:19.600 --> 43:21.680
I ain't waiting around
for some humie with a death wish.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.040
You got the Orb, right?

43:23.160 --> 43:24.800
Yes.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.080
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.120
No!

43:51.200 --> 43:53.200
We're not leaving without the Orb.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.200
Behold.

44:10.760 --> 44:12.880
This one shows spirit.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.880
He shall make a keen ally
in the battle against Ronan.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.320
Companion, what were you retrieving?

44:24.720 --> 44:26.160
You're an imbecile.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.760
PETER: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.160
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

44:38.320 --> 44:40.920
You can't take apart my ship
without asking me!

44:41.080 --> 44:42.920
-See, what is this?
-Don't touch that!

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
It's a bomb.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.120
-A bomb?
-Yup.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.920
And you leave it lying around?

44:47.040 --> 44:48.680
I was gonna put it in a box.

44:48.800 --> 44:49.840
What's a box gonna do?

44:50.000 --> 44:52.120
-How about this one?
-No! Whoa. Hey!

44:52.240 --> 44:53.200
-Leave it alone.
-Why? What is it?

44:53.280 --> 44:54.880
-Shut up.
-Hey!

44:56.120 --> 44:57.160
What is that?

44:57.280 --> 45:00.080
That's for if things get really hardcore.

45:00.440 --> 45:01.840
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.280
No one's blowing up moons.

45:03.440 --> 45:05.720
You just wanna suck the joy
out of everything.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.920
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

45:08.320 --> 45:11.160
We're heading in the right direction.
For now.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.800
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

45:13.960 --> 45:15.280
And how much do you trust me?

45:15.480 --> 45:18.440
I'd trust you a lot more
if you told me what this was.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.320
Because I'm guessing
it's some kind of weapon.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.840
I don't know what it is.

45:23.920 --> 45:26.160
If it's a weapon,
we should use it against Ronan.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.240
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.320
Or just you, murderess!

45:29.480 --> 45:31.160
I let you live once, princess!

45:31.280 --> 45:33.320
-I am not a princess!
-PETER: Hey!

45:33.440 --> 45:37.080
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

45:37.840 --> 45:41.280
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.480
I have no interest in money.

45:43.840 --> 45:45.040
Great.

45:46.280 --> 45:49.320
That means more money
for the three of us.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.520
Mmm?

45:52.080 --> 45:53.840
For the four of us.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.240
Partners.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.960
We have an agreement,

45:57.040 --> 45:58.520
but I would never be partners
with the likes of you.

45:59.400 --> 46:01.160
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

46:02.240 --> 46:05.440
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.760
Oh, she has no idea.

46:12.240 --> 46:14.240
If I had a black light,

46:14.320 --> 46:16.880
the place would look like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.200
You got issues, Quill.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.440
GUARD: I swear.
I don't know where they went! I swear.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.800
NEBULA: If he knew
where they were headed,

46:32.880 --> 46:34.000
he would have already told us.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.080
Yeah.

46:35.560 --> 46:36.560
Ronan,

46:36.880 --> 46:39.920
the Nova Corps sent a fleet
to defend the prison.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Well, then,

46:41.120 --> 46:44.240
send Necrocraft
to every corner of the quadrant.

46:44.400 --> 46:47.920
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.400
And this place?

46:49.520 --> 46:51.040
The Nova can't know what we're after.

46:52.520 --> 46:54.400
Cleanse it!

46:57.320 --> 46:59.320
Do you got any other
cute little buggers like this one?

46:59.960 --> 47:03.440
I like to stick 'em all in a row
on my control console.

47:04.040 --> 47:06.040
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.240
He's being fully serious.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.560
-In that case, I can show you...
-

47:11.240 --> 47:13.520
But first, you gonna tell me
what this Orb is,

47:13.600 --> 47:15.960
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.240
And then you gonna tell me,

47:18.400 --> 47:20.440
who out there might wanna buy it.

47:20.600 --> 47:23.280
Sir, the high-end community is a...

47:26.240 --> 47:28.320
-The high-end community is a...
-

47:28.400 --> 47:29.920
It's a tight-knit...

47:30.040 --> 47:31.200
Tight-knit...

47:31.320 --> 47:33.120
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

47:33.240 --> 47:34.240
-

47:34.320 --> 47:35.600
I cannot possibly betray

47:36.280 --> 47:38.040
the confidentiality of my buyers!

47:49.160 --> 47:51.440
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

47:55.160 --> 47:56.480
TIVAN: Carina.

47:56.600 --> 47:57.880
Yes, Master.

47:57.960 --> 48:00.960
TIVAN: Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

48:01.360 --> 48:02.880
We do, Master.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.960
TIVAN: Then use them.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.560
I don't have to remind you

48:08.640 --> 48:11.640
what happened to the last attendant
who disappointed me.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.640
Do I?

48:16.320 --> 48:20.480
Chop, chop.
Our guests will be here soon.

48:24.320 --> 48:27.000
ROCKET: Heads up! We're inbound.

48:42.400 --> 48:43.560
Whoa.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.360
What is it?

48:48.400 --> 48:50.360
GAMORA: It's called Knowhere.

48:50.440 --> 48:53.400
The severed head
of an ancient celestial being.

48:53.920 --> 48:55.560
Be wary headed in, rodent.

48:56.680 --> 49:00.000
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

49:24.320 --> 49:27.200
GAMORA: Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

49:27.280 --> 49:29.960
to mine the organic matter
within the skull.

49:30.040 --> 49:32.240
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

49:32.360 --> 49:37.240
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

49:37.520 --> 49:41.200
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

49:41.320 --> 49:43.080
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

49:43.560 --> 49:44.680
Billy the Kid,

49:45.040 --> 49:47.000
Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.480
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

49:48.560 --> 49:49.600
Yeah, you should.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.200
KID: Excuse me.

49:52.280 --> 49:54.560
-Watch your wallets.
-Can you spare any units?

50:02.120 --> 50:03.640
PETER: Get out of here.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.000
Your buyer's in there?

50:11.400 --> 50:13.280
We are to wait here
for his representative.

50:13.400 --> 50:14.760
-BOUNCER: Get out of here!
-

50:15.080 --> 50:17.240
This is no respectable establishment.

50:17.360 --> 50:19.400
What do you expect us to do
while we wait?

50:21.240 --> 50:22.320
Yes! Yes!

50:23.120 --> 50:24.240
Whoa!

50:31.320 --> 50:32.640
Yahoo!

50:39.600 --> 50:41.440
My Orloni has won,

50:41.640 --> 50:43.440
as I won at all things!

50:44.160 --> 50:46.720
Now, let's put more of this liquid
into our bodies.

50:47.040 --> 50:50.800
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

50:52.480 --> 50:54.360
Man, you wouldn't believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

50:54.440 --> 50:56.640
I might actually lose money on this job.

50:56.760 --> 50:58.480
GAMORA:
My connection is making us wait.

50:59.040 --> 51:02.800
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.080
Where yours is more,

51:05.280 --> 51:08.080
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

51:09.280 --> 51:10.640
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

51:10.760 --> 51:11.840
Thanos?

51:13.640 --> 51:15.120
He's not my father.

51:16.320 --> 51:17.600
When Thanos took my home world,

51:17.760 --> 51:20.160
he killed my parents in front of me.

51:21.160 --> 51:22.480
He tortured me,

51:22.640 --> 51:25.160
turned me into a weapon.

51:25.560 --> 51:29.560
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

51:29.680 --> 51:31.680
I couldn't stand by and...

51:36.560 --> 51:38.560
Why would you risk your life for this?

51:39.440 --> 51:40.560
-

51:40.640 --> 51:42.320
My mother gave it to me.

51:44.320 --> 51:47.120
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

51:47.200 --> 51:48.200
I happened to have it on me,

51:48.560 --> 51:50.440
when I was...

51:51.240 --> 51:53.120
The day that she...

51:55.440 --> 51:57.240
You know, when I left Earth.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.360
GAMORA: What do you do with it?

51:59.480 --> 52:03.200
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

52:03.360 --> 52:07.880
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

52:08.200 --> 52:09.320
Really?

52:09.440 --> 52:13.600
On my planet,
there's a legend about people like you.

52:13.720 --> 52:15.160
It's called

52:15.440 --> 52:16.600
Footloose.

52:16.720 --> 52:20.720
And in it, a great hero

52:20.880 --> 52:22.320
named Kevin Bacon,

52:23.240 --> 52:27.760
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

52:29.160 --> 52:30.880
It's the greatest thing there is.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.400
Who put the sticks up their butts?

52:33.560 --> 52:34.920
What? No, that's just a...

52:35.240 --> 52:36.880
-That is cruel.
-It's just a phrase

52:37.200 --> 52:39.360
people use.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.920
The melody is pleasant!

53:17.200 --> 53:19.320
-No!
-Ow! What the hell?

53:19.440 --> 53:20.720
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

53:20.880 --> 53:24.240
And I am not some starry-eyed waif
here to succumb to your...

53:24.400 --> 53:26.480
Your pelvic sorcery!

53:26.640 --> 53:27.960
That is not what is happening here.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.920
Oh, no.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.560
Stop it!

53:45.880 --> 53:46.880
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

53:47.440 --> 53:50.480
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

53:50.640 --> 53:52.560
-That is true!
-He has no respect!

53:52.680 --> 53:55.000
-That is also true!
-Hold on! Hold on!

53:55.320 --> 53:57.320
ROCKET: Keep calling me
vermin, tough guy!

53:57.480 --> 53:59.480
You just wanna laugh at me
like everyone else!

53:59.640 --> 54:02.280
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.000
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

54:05.320 --> 54:07.320
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

54:07.720 --> 54:09.720
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

54:09.840 --> 54:11.800
and put back together, over and over

54:14.400 --> 54:15.440
Some little monster!

54:15.560 --> 54:17.480
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

54:17.600 --> 54:19.680
He called me "vermin"!

54:19.840 --> 54:22.520
She called me "rodent"!

54:22.640 --> 54:23.920
Let's see if you can laugh

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

54:27.360 --> 54:28.680
No, no, no, no!

54:28.840 --> 54:30.960
Four billion units! Rocket!

54:31.320 --> 54:32.280
Come on, man. Hey!

54:32.360 --> 54:33.360
Suck it up for one more lousy night

54:33.480 --> 54:34.960
and you're rich.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.880
Fine.

54:45.480 --> 54:46.840
But I can't promise, when all this is over

54:46.960 --> 54:48.640
I'm not gonna kill
every last one of you jerks.

54:48.760 --> 54:52.360
See? That's exactly why
none of you have any friends!

54:52.880 --> 54:55.560
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

54:55.640 --> 54:59.600
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

54:59.720 --> 55:01.720
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

55:04.040 --> 55:06.040
-Drax!
-Let him go.

55:06.400 --> 55:07.560
We don't need him.

55:10.080 --> 55:11.880
CARINA: Milady Gamora.

55:12.080 --> 55:13.880
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

55:20.360 --> 55:22.080
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

55:22.640 --> 55:25.520
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

55:26.080 --> 55:28.640
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

55:35.400 --> 55:36.560
I present to you,

55:36.920 --> 55:40.680
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

55:54.520 --> 55:56.600
Oh, my dear Gamora.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.760
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

55:59.920 --> 56:02.560
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

56:02.960 --> 56:05.520
We have what we discussed.

56:06.440 --> 56:10.960
What is that thing there?

56:11.080 --> 56:12.840
I am Groot.

56:16.920 --> 56:18.640
TIVAN: I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

56:18.760 --> 56:20.120
Sir...

56:20.880 --> 56:24.080
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

56:24.440 --> 56:27.120
At the moment of your death, of course.

56:27.480 --> 56:28.640
I am Groot.

56:28.760 --> 56:31.560
Why, so he could turn you
into a frickin' chair?

56:31.640 --> 56:32.640
That's your pet?

56:33.920 --> 56:35.640
-His what?
-Tivan.

56:36.160 --> 56:39.920
We have been halfway
around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

56:40.080 --> 56:42.120
Very well, then.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.800
Let us see what you brought.

56:58.600 --> 57:01.160
DISPATCHER: Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

57:01.520 --> 57:04.760
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

57:04.840 --> 57:05.920
Uh...

57:06.480 --> 57:09.160
You shall send a message for me.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.080
Oh, my new friends.

57:12.560 --> 57:15.680
Before creation itself,

57:15.800 --> 57:17.560
there were six singularities.

57:19.760 --> 57:23.520
Then the universe exploded
into existence,

57:23.680 --> 57:25.680
and the remnants of these systems

57:25.840 --> 57:29.200
were forged into concentrated ingots.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.200
-Infinity Stones.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.920
These stones, it seems,

57:35.040 --> 57:36.920
can only be brandished

57:37.040 --> 57:40.640
by beings of extraordinary strength.

57:40.760 --> 57:41.800
Observe.

57:44.960 --> 57:50.800
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

57:50.880 --> 57:54.520
like wheat in a field.

57:55.880 --> 57:58.080
There's a little pee
coming out of me right now.

57:58.920 --> 58:00.160
Once, for a moment,

58:00.480 --> 58:04.520
a group was able to share
the energy amongst themselves,

58:04.640 --> 58:07.600
but even they
were quickly destroyed by it.

58:13.760 --> 58:15.520
Beautiful.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.720
Beyond compare.

58:19.800 --> 58:21.800
Blah, blah, blah.

58:21.880 --> 58:25.600
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

58:27.560 --> 58:28.840
TIVAN: How would you like to get paid?

58:28.960 --> 58:31.000
ROCKET: What do you think,
fancy man? Units!

58:32.600 --> 58:33.640
TIVAN: Very well, then.

58:39.120 --> 58:40.600
Carina.

58:40.880 --> 58:41.880
Stand back.

58:42.600 --> 58:45.120
I will no longer be your slave!

58:45.280 --> 58:46.800
No!

59:34.080 --> 59:35.160
What the...

59:45.080 --> 59:47.320
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

59:47.640 --> 59:49.680
What do you still have it for?

59:49.760 --> 59:51.000
PETER: What are we gonna do,
leave it in there?

59:51.080 --> 59:53.000
I can't believe you had that
in your purse!

59:53.800 --> 59:54.920
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

59:55.040 --> 59:56.840
We have to bring this
to the Nova Corps.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.800
There's a chance they can contain it.

59:58.880 --> 59:59.880
ROCKET: Are you kidding me?

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.880
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:04.200
So he can destroy the galaxy?

1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:06.160
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:09.280
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:11.160
Because I'm one of the idiots
who lives in it!

1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:12.760
Peter, listen to me.

1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:16.040
We cannot allow the Stone
to fall into Ronan's hands.

1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:17.840
We have to go back to your ship,

1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:19.360
and deliver it to Nova.

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:22.000
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:26.760
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:28.080
who's really nice

1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:29.960
for a whole lot of money.

1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:32.720
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:33.840
You're despicable.

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:35.400
Dishonorable.

1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:37.080
Faithless!

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:39.320
-Oh, no.
-DRAX: At last!

1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:44.360
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:46.240
You called Ronan?

1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:54.160
YONDU: Quill! Don't you move, boy!

1:00:55.280 --> 1:00:57.400
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:03.840
Ronan the Accuser!

1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:06.320
You are the one
who transmitted the message?

1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:07.880
DRAX: You killed my wife.

1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:10.680
You killed my daughter!

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:21.920
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:30.880
It is Gamora.
She is escaping with the Orb.

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:41.240
No!

1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:42.320
RONAN: Nebula,

1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:44.920
-retrieve the Orb.
-

1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:03.280
NEBULA: The Stone
is in the furthest pod.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:05.240
Bring it down!

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:23.280
Ah!

1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:37.000
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:39.480
How? We've got
no weaponry on these things.

1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:41.400
These pods are industrial grade.

1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:42.840
They're nearly indestructible.

1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:45.120
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:47.200
That's not what I'm saying.

1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:49.480
Oh!

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:37.360
PETER: Let me borrow your ride.

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:12.080
I don't recall killing your family.

1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:18.600
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:38.160
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:39.880
I have to head out.

1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:44.240
Wait! These things
aren't meant to go out there.

1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:53.200
You are a disappointment, sister.

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.960
Of all our siblings,

1:04:56.640 --> 1:04:58.240
I hated you least.

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:00.000
GAMORA: Nebula, please.

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:01.640
If Ronan gets this stone

1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:04.000
-he'll kill us all.
-NEBULA: Not all.

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:07.280
You will already be dead.

1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:04.720
NEBULA: Ronan, it is done.

1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:08.960
ROCKET: Quill, come on.

1:06:09.440 --> 1:06:12.000
Her body mods should keep her alive
a couple more minutes,

1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:14.160
but there's nothing we can do for her.

1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:15.680
These pods
aren't meant to be out here.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.320
In a second, we're gonna be
in the same boat.

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:28.200
Aw, damn it.

1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:31.000
ROCKET: Quill?

1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:32.720
Yondu! Yondu.

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:34.240
This is Quill!

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:37.760
-My coordinates are 227K324.
-ROCKET: Quill.

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:39.280
Quill, what are you doing?

1:06:39.400 --> 1:06:40.760
Just outside Knowhere.

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:43.200
If you're there, come get me.

1:06:43.760 --> 1:06:45.360
I'm all yours.

1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:56.720
ROCKET: Quill, don't be ridiculous.

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:00.480
Get back into your pod!

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:04.080
You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.

1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:07.120
You'll die in seconds!

1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:08.480
Quill.

1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:11.280
Quill?

1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:14.400
What happened?

1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:17.560
I saw you out there.

1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:21.480
I don't know what came over me.

1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:24.320
But I couldn't let you die.

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:29.520
I found something inside of myself.

1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:32.200
Something

1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:34.280
incredibly heroic.

1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:38.520
I mean, not to brag,

1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:39.880
-but, objectively...
-

1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:41.200
Where's the Orb?

1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:45.240
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:46.400
-What?
-

1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:51.560
Welcome home, Peter.

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:17.280
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:20.760
Quill just got himself captured.

1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:25.320
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:26.640
take on a frickin' army!

1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:29.640
You're right.

1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:34.480
I was a fool.

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:38.600
All the anger,

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:41.200
all the rage,

1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:46.600
was just to cover my loss.

1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:57.520
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
"My wife and child are dead."

1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:01.320
Oh, I don't care if it's mean!

1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:03.360
Everybody's got dead people.

1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:05.600
It's no excuse to get everybody else

1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:07.680
dead along the way!

1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:14.280
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:17.600
The only chance we got is
to get to the other side of the universe

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.600
as fast as we can and maybe,

1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:24.440
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:28.320
I am Groot.

1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:30.640
Save them? How?

1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:33.600
I am Groot.

1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:36.440
I know they're the only friends
that we ever had,

1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:39.320
but there's an army
of Ravagers around them.

1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:40.960
And there's only two of us!

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.360
Three.

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:51.280
Aw!

1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:54.640
You're making me

1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:56.400
beat...up

1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:57.560
grass!

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.760
RONAN: The Orb is in my possession,

1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:04.480
as I promised.

1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:06.000
Bring it to me.

1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:09.600
Yes, that was our agreement.

1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:11.920
Bring you the Orb,

1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:15.680
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:20.480
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:22.600
I wonder what use I have for you.

1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.360
Boy,

1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:26.960
I would reconsider your current course.

1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:30.480
Master! You cannot!

1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:33.040
Thanos is the most powerful being
in the universe.

1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:35.440
Not anymore.

1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:00.520
You call me "boy!"

1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:05.080
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice
on Xandar,

1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:08.840
and burn it to its core!

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:10.920
Then, Thanos,

1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:13.040
I am coming for you.

1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:18.480
After Xandar,
you are going to kill my father?

1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:20.720
You dare to oppose me?

1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:22.680
You see what he has turned me into.

1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:26.960
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:29.440
-YONDU: You betray me?
-

1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:31.360
Steal my money?

1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:32.920
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:35.520
When I picked you up as a kid,

1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:37.920
these boys wanted to eat you.

1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:40.600
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:42.480
I saved your life!

1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:44.680
Oh, will you shut up about that? God!

1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:47.040
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:49.880
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:53.640
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.120
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

1:12:56.480 --> 1:12:57.600
You abducted me, man.

1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:00.800
You stole me from my home
and from my family.

1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:03.000
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:04.640
You're scared

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:06.840
because you're soft in here.

1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:07.960
Here, right here!

1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:09.480
GAMORA: Yondu!

1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:10.760
Listen to me.

1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:13.040
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:14.960
I know what he's got, girl.

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.560
Then you know we must get it back!

1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:21.000
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:24.160
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:26.920
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.000
-Sentiment?
-

1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:31.480
Eating away your brain like maggots!

1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:39.160
No!

1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:40.840
Sorry, boy.

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:44.560
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:45.880
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:50.960
If you kill me now,

1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:55.200
you are saying goodbye to
the biggest score you have ever seen.

1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:01.840
The Stone?

1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:04.600
I hope you got something
better than that.

1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:07.440
Because ain't nobody stealing
from Ronan.

1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:09.880
We got a ringer.

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.520
Is that right?

1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:14.920
She knows everything
there is to know about Ronan.

1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:16.440
His ships,

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:18.040
his army.

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:20.040
He's vulnerable.

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:22.120
Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh?

1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:25.840
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:34.680
Let him go!

1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:38.880
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:41.760
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:52.000
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:54.480
ROCKET: Attention, idiots.

1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:00.200
The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:02.080
It's a weapon of my own design.

1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:03.560
What the hell?

1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:06.640
If you don't hand over
our companions now,

1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:09.040
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:10.960
A very big new one!

1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:13.960
-I ain't buyin' it.
-I'm giving you to the count of five.

1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:17.720
-5, 4, 3...
-No! Wait, hold on!

1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:19.640
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:21.760
We figured it out! We're fine!

1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:23.120
ROCKET: Oh, hey, Quill.
What's going on?

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:26.680
You call that "figured it out"?

1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:29.040
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:30.680
Oh, you want to talk about senseless?

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:33.040
How about trying to save us
by blowing us up?

1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:35.960
We were only gonna blow you up
if they didn't turn you over!

1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:37.880
And how on earth
were they gonna turn us over

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.120
when you only gave them
a count of five?

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:42.000
We didn't have time
to work out the minutiae

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:43.120
of the plan.

1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:45.640
This is what we get
for acting altruistically.

1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:47.800
-I am Groot.
-They are ungrateful.

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:49.000
What's important now

1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:50.840
is we get the Ravagers' army

1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:52.120
to help us save Xandar.

1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:53.760
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:55.320
who's just gonna sell
to somebody even worse?

1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:57.120
We'll figure that part out later.

1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:59.000
We have to stop Ronan.

1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:00.640
How?

1:16:00.760 --> 1:16:01.800
I have a plan.

1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:02.880
You've got a plan?

1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:04.320
Yes.

1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:06.000
First of all, you're copying me from

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.600
-when I said I had a plan.
-No, I'm not.

1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:10.640
People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:12.240
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:15.320
I have part of a plan!

1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:17.040
What percentage of a plan
do you have?

1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:18.720
You don't get to ask questions

1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:20.000
after the nonsense
you pulled on Knowhere.

1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:22.080
I just saved Quill.

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:23.160
We've already established

1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:24.960
that you destroying the ship
that I'm on is not saving me.

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:27.160
-When did we establish it?
-Like three seconds ago!

1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:28.920
I wasn't listening.
I was thinking of something else.

1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:31.120
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:33.040
What percentage?

1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:34.640
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:36.000
Twelve percent?

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:39.120
That's a fake laugh.

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:41.040
-It's real!
-Totally fake.

1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:45.800
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:46.960
because that is not a plan.

1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:48.600
It's barely a concept.

1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:49.720
You're taking their side?

1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:51.040
I am Groot.

1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:52.600
So what, it's better than 11%?

1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:54.120
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1:16:54.200 --> 1:16:56.360
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1:16:56.960 --> 1:17:00.320
See? Groot's the only one of you
who has a clue.

1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:06.360
Guys.

1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:08.280
Come on.

1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:10.640
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:13.080
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:16.360
I need your help.

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:20.400
I look around at us.

1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:22.000
You know what I see?

1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:23.960
Losers.

1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:28.160
I mean, like,

1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:30.240
folks who have lost stuff.

1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:32.640
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:35.000
Our homes,

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:37.080
our families,

1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:40.120
normal lives.

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:43.040
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:45.320
Today, it's given us something.

1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:47.080
It has given us a chance.

1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:48.720
To do what?

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:51.880
To give a shit.

1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:54.320
For once.

1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:56.680
Not run away.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:01.920
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:05.120
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:08.840
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:11.920
it's impossible.

1:18:12.360 --> 1:18:14.760
You're asking us to die.

1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:23.240
Yeah, I guess I am.

1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:37.200
GAMORA: Quill.

1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:44.800
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:53.040
I will be grateful
to die among my friends.

1:18:57.280 --> 1:18:59.200
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.160
I will fight beside you.

1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:05.920
And in the end,

1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:09.920
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:19.000
I am Groot.

1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:32.480
Oh, what the hell.
I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:40.880
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:43.360
We're all standing up now.

1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:46.920
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:55.560
GAMORA: The Stone reacts
to anything organic.

1:19:55.880 --> 1:19:57.880
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1:19:57.960 --> 1:20:01.080
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:02.920
All plants, animals,

1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:04.440
-Nova Corps.
-GAMORA: Everything will die.

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.120
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:12.080
PETER: Rocket will lead a team
to blow a hole

1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:14.320
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:18.480
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:21.400
Won't there be
hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1:20:21.480 --> 1:20:24.360
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:31.520
Once they know we're on board,

1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:35.160
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:37.600
Which I can disable
by dismantling the power source.

1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:39.520
PETER: We'll make it to the flight deck,

1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:42.600
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer
to kill Ronan.

1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:48.280
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:50.960
Use these devices to contain it.

1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:52.600
If you touch it,

1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:54.840
it will kill you.

1:20:57.520 --> 1:20:59.440
PETER: I'll contact
one of the Nova officers

1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:00.880
-who arrested us.
-

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.480
Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.

1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:07.280
There's one more thing
we need to complete the plan.

1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:09.280
That guy's eye.

1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:12.640
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:14.200
that guy's eye.

1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:17.960
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:24.240
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,

1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:25.440
and will arrive in T-minus

1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:27.280
fifteen minutes.

1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.120
Remember, boy.

1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:31.400
At the end of all this,

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:32.960
I get the Stone.

1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:35.440
You cross me, we kill you all.

1:21:58.160 --> 1:21:59.400
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:10.240
This is a terrible plan.

1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:12.440
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:18.520
Nova Prime.

1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:21.320
I received a transmission

1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:22.640
from one of the Ravagers.

1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:25.960
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:27.360
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:28.600
Good God.

1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:30.720
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:33.360
NOVA PRIME: Did he say
why we should believe him?

1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:35.600
He said his crew
just escaped from prison

1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:38.720
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:40.720
He says that he's an

1:22:41.720 --> 1:22:42.960
"a-hole."

1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:44.400
But he's not,

1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:46.320
and I'm quoting him, here,

1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:48.600
"100% a dick."

1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:50.160
Do you believe him?

1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:53.960
I don't know that I believe anyone
is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1:22:54.040 --> 1:22:56.960
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:01.560
Yeah.

1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:13.200
A fleet approaches.

1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:15.240
They appear to be Ravagers.

1:23:26.280 --> 1:23:27.360
Fire!

1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:39.760
YONDU: Cover it down.

1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:42.080
Submerge!

1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:56.160
Rocket, hurry!

1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:03.760
All pilots, dive!

1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:05.200
They're beneath us!

1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:15.400
NOVA PRIME: Evacuate the city.

1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:19.120
Our priority is to get our people
away from the battle.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:27.160
Forward thrust, now!

1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:41.600
Come on!

1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:44.840
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:08.680
YONDU: Aw, hell!

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:10.360
-I'm going down, Quill!
-

1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:12.280
No more games with me, boy!

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:13.440
I'll see you

1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:15.360
at the end of this!

1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:23.120
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:25.520
We'll never make it up there!

1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:41.640
SAAL: Peter Quill.

1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:44.280
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:47.640
For the record,
I advised against trusting you here.

1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:49.240
They got my "dick" message!

1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:50.720
Prove me wrong.

1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:22.440
Yes!

1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:24.840
-

1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:27.600
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:33.320
The starboard kern has been breached!

1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:34.680
We have been boarded.

1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:36.280
Continue our approach.

1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:37.640
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:40.480
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:41.600
Seal security doors!

1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:42.800
Now!

1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:46.800
NEBULA: Get out of my way!

1:26:58.200 --> 1:26:59.640
Oh, man.

1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:04.280
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:08.280
The Dark Aster
must not reach the ground.

1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:21.840
NOVA CORPS PILOT 1: Locked in!

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:23.840
NOVA CORPS PILOT 2: Locked in.

1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:26.480
We're locked in.

1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:06.880
I can barely see.

1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:34.960
When did you learn to do that?

1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:36.680
Pretty sure the answer is

1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:38.480
"I am Groot."

1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:42.040
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:48.760
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:51.520
It is pleasing to once again have

1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:53.040
friends.

1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:57.000
You, Quill, are my friend.

1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:58.400
Thanks.

1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:01.360
-This dumb tree, he is my friend.
-GROOT: Mmm.

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:03.920
And this green whore, she, too...

1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:05.640
Oh, you must stop!

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:11.360
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:13.920
You have always been weak.

1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:16.440
You stupid, traitorous...

1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:23.840
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1:29:24.960 --> 1:29:26.000
Head to the flight deck.

1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:28.840
I'll shut down the power
to the security doors.

1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:38.680
GUARD: Yondu Udonta.

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:42.440
Order your men
to turn on the Nova Corps.

1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:00.640
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:02.640
-Time to die...
-

1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:26.680
-

1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:36.440
Nebula, please.

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.680
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1:30:53.800 --> 1:30:55.840
enact immolation initiative.

1:30:59.440 --> 1:31:00.840
STARBLASTER PILOT:
They're dive-bombing the city!

1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:02.760
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:04.600
No! Hold your positions.

1:31:36.120 --> 1:31:37.680
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1:31:37.800 --> 1:31:39.480
We'll take care of the people
down here.

1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:41.720
I can't believe
I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1:31:44.880 --> 1:31:46.080
Star-Lord.

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:47.640
Finally.

1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:54.280
Ah!

1:31:58.600 --> 1:31:59.600
-You thief!
-

1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:14.200
You will never make it to Ronan.

1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.200
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1:32:30.920 --> 1:32:32.200
Come on!

1:33:15.080 --> 1:33:18.680
Finger to the throat means death.

1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:25.840
Metaphor.

1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:27.200
Yeah, sorta.

1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:28.680
Oh, no.

1:33:56.680 --> 1:33:58.000
RONAN: Xandar!

1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:01.240
You stand accused.

1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:05.120
Your wretched peace treaty will not

1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:06.400
save you now.

1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:10.200
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:35.880
Rocket!

1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:37.840
Hold on, Saal, just...

1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:05.800
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:07.440
The city's been evacuated,

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:10.200
but we're getting our asses
kicked down here.

1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:11.800
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:37.400
GAMORA: Nebula!

1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:41.480
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:43.200
You know he's crazy.

1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:45.840
I know you're both crazy.

1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:47.080
No!

1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:51.000
-What the...?
-Ah!

1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:53.840
-NEBULA: Get out!
-

1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:36.160
You did it!

1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:04.000
I was mistaken.

1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:05.560
I do remember your family.

1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:08.080
Their screams were

1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:10.280
-pitiful. I...
-

1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:08.520
No, Groot!

1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:10.280
You can't.

1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:11.680
You'll die.

1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:14.240
Why are you doing this?

1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:15.960
Why?

1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:24.080
We

1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:25.480
are

1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:27.560
Groot.

1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:34.120
I called him an idiot.

1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:58.640
You killed Groot!

1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:04.240
Behold!

1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:08.520
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:11.160
What fruit have they wrought?

1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:15.320
Only that my father and his father

1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:18.840
shall finally know vengeance.

1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:21.360
People of Xandar,

1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:23.680
the time has come

1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:26.680
to rejoice and renounce

1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:29.160
your paltry gods!

1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:33.280
Your salvation is at hand.

1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:47.520
Listen to these words.

1:41:56.560 --> 1:41:58.320
Now bring it down hard!

1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:02.720
What are you doing?

1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:05.760
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:10.640
Gamora.

1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:13.720
Subtle. Take it back.

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:16.440
What are you doing?

1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:19.120
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:36.720
No!

1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:13.840
Peter! Take my hand!

1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:21.400
Take my hand, Peter.

1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:23.680
Mom.

1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:26.280
GAMORA: Take my hand!

1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:22.640
You're mortal!

1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:24.000
How?

1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:26.480
You said it yourself, bitch.

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:28.840
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1:44:58.760 --> 1:44:59.920
YONDU: Well, well, well.

1:45:00.560 --> 1:45:01.640
Quite the light show.

1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:05.600
Ain't this sweet.

1:45:07.040 --> 1:45:09.640
But you got some business to attend to

1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:12.320
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:16.040
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:18.400
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:20.440
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:22.440
but the only way
the universe can survive

1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:24.320
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.320
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:31.400
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:34.600
Hand it over, son.

1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:52.480
Yondu.

1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:58.760
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:01.840
You've seen what it does to people.

1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:14.840
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:18.480
It's probably good
we didn't deliver him to his dad

1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:19.560
like we was hired to do.

1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:22.440
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:30.720
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:35.440
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:38.160
Oh, I know.

1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:41.720
But he was about the only family I had.

1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:45.680
No.

1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:48.080
He wasn't.

1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:37.720
PETER: Why would you
even know this?

1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:40.800
DEY: When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:42.200
so we had it checked out.

1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:45.160
I'm not Terran?

1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:46.880
NOVA PRIME: You are half Terran.

1:47:47.040 --> 1:47:50.720
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:54.520
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:55.880
That could be why you were able

1:47:56.040 --> 1:47:58.240
to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:00.160
-Your friends have arrived.

1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:04.480
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:07.480
we'd like to express
our profound gratitude

1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:09.920
for your help in saving Xandar.

1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:14.560
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:16.160
he has something to show you.

1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:18.080
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1:48:26.760 --> 1:48:31.160
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:32.920
Yes.

1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:34.960
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:37.920
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:43.280
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:45.920
We salvaged as much as we could.

1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:48.280
Wow.

1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:50.000
I...

1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:53.120
Thank you.

1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:56.280
I have a family.

1:48:56.880 --> 1:48:58.280
They're alive because of you.

1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.280
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:09.640
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:11.120
ROCKET: Question.

1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:12.560
What if I see something
that I want to take,

1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:13.880
and it belongs to someone else?

1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:15.200
DEY: You will be arrested.

1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:17.640
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000
-It's still illegal.
-That doesn't follow.

1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:21.160
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:22.960
What are you laughing at?

1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:24.680
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:26.640
What if someone
does something irksome

1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:28.880
and I decide to remove his spine?

1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:31.640
That's...

1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:34.920
That's actually murder.

1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:39.160
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:42.160
So...also illegal.

1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:44.040
Hmm.

1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:46.880
They'll be fine, Dey.

1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:48.800
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:49.920
You?

1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:56.240
Yeah. Me.
