<i>I always believed
it was the things you don't choose</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.671
<i>that makes you who you are.</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:49.341
<i>Your city.</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:51.343
<i>Your neighborhood.</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:54.680
<i>Your family.</i>

00:57.558 --> 01:00.811
<i>People here take pride in these things.</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:03.730
<i>Like it was something
they'd accomplished.</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:09.361
<i>The bodies around their souls.</i>

01:11.029 --> 01:13.365
<i>The cities wrapped around those.</i>

01:37.973 --> 01:41.018
<i>I lived on this block my whole life.</i>

01:42.436 --> 01:44.521
<i>Most of these people have.</i>

01:46.231 --> 01:49.902
<i>When your job is to find people
who are missing,</i>

01:49.985 --> 01:52.613
<i>it helps to know where they started.</i>

01:53.822 --> 01:57.451
<i>I find the people
who started in the cracks,</i>

01:57.534 --> 01:59.411
<i>and then fell through.</i>

02:05.542 --> 02:07.669
<i>This city can be hard.</i>

02:09.463 --> 02:13.091
<i>When I was young, I asked my priest
how you could get to heaven</i>

02:13.759 --> 02:17.387
<i>and still protect yourself
from all the evil in the world.</i>

02:19.723 --> 02:24.645
<i>He told me what God said
to his children.</i>

02:24.686 --> 02:28.982
<i>"You are sheep among wolves,</i>

02:29.066 --> 02:32.236
<i>"be wise as serpents,</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:35.239
<i>"yet innocent as doves."</i>

02:36.156 --> 02:37.908
You live just across the street.
Is that right, ma'am?

02:37.950 --> 02:40.369
That one on the corner,
that's our house.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.998
You know, to get Annette
in high school, you have...

02:49.670 --> 02:51.672
- I heard they had an opening.
- Yeah, me, too.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.473
The thing is, she always
had a smile on her face.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.810
That was her. She was always smiling.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.021
I mean, who would take my little girl?

03:08.105 --> 03:09.857
She never hurt anybody,
never caused...

03:09.940 --> 03:14.486
Whoever you are, if you have her,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.780
you just let her go.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.324
Now, we won't charge you,

03:20.117 --> 03:23.996
<i>but if you're out there,
just let her come home.</i>

03:24.037 --> 03:26.832
<i>All right? Let her come home.</i>

03:27.291 --> 03:29.042
<i>I mean,
who would take my little girl?</i>

03:29.126 --> 03:31.503
<i>- You fucking cops.
- She never caused no trouble,</i>

03:31.545 --> 03:34.006
<i>she never got in any fights,
she's a sweetheart.</i>

03:34.089 --> 03:37.259
<i>- This is just unbelievable.
- She was a good kid.</i>

03:37.342 --> 03:39.428
The whole force
standing outside the house,

03:39.511 --> 03:42.389
guarding the sidewalk
with their arms crossed.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.226
I mean, are the kidnappers
coming back?

03:46.310 --> 03:48.312
<i>Amanda McCready
was taken from her home</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:51.190
<i>between 8:00 and 8:30
Wednesday night.</i>

03:51.231 --> 03:53.942
<i>She's four years old,
has blond hair and green eyes...</i>

03:54.026 --> 03:55.027
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.113
<i>...weighs 35 pounds
and is 40 inches tall.</i>

03:58.197 --> 04:00.532
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah. I know.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.451
<i>A beleaguered
police force and a weary citizenry</i>

04:02.534 --> 04:04.870
<i>have been left with so little to cling to.</i>

04:04.912 --> 04:08.874
<i>A blanket, a back door,
and a doll named Mirabelle.</i>

04:08.957 --> 04:10.751
The neighborhood's
really coming together.

04:10.834 --> 04:11.919
We're gonna have a rally.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.506
Everyone's gonna have a vigil.
We're gonna have a vigil tonight.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.341
You know, the neighborhood's all alert,

04:17.423 --> 04:20.719
everybody's alert of what's going on
and everything that...

04:20.761 --> 04:25.265
The surroundings. We got flyers up,
posters up, we have all that stuff up.

04:25.349 --> 04:28.310
So everybody's well aware
and everybody's looking for Amanda.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.771
<i>In related news,
the Boston police captain</i>

04:30.854 --> 04:33.524
<i>responsible for preventing
crimes against children</i>

04:33.941 --> 04:36.068
<i>spoke a few words a moment ago,</i>

04:36.151 --> 04:37.694
<i>words of comfort.</i>

04:37.736 --> 04:42.115
<i>I know the pain of losing a daughter.
We will not fail.</i>

04:42.908 --> 04:45.410
<i>We will pursue every avenue.</i>

04:45.452 --> 04:46.703
Do you know the mother?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.664
<i>Captain Jack Doyle on
details of the missing Dorchester girl...</i>

04:48.747 --> 04:53.085
Little bit.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.837
She was blowing Mike Gulley
down the post

04:54.920 --> 04:58.298
when he was still 14 and innocent
and milking cows up Vermont.

04:59.675 --> 05:00.968
I don't know about innocent.

05:01.051 --> 05:04.596
<i>Her mother says Amanda
may be carrying a little girl of her own.</i>

05:04.680 --> 05:07.975
<i>Mirabelle was last seen with Amanda.
It's her favorite doll.</i>

05:09.726 --> 05:11.353
This is horrible.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.315
- Not if you're Channel 9.
- Turn it off.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.488
Good night.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.708
- Hey, Angie. Get the door?
- I'm in the bathroom.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.591
It's 7:00! Seven in the fucking morning!

05:40.674 --> 05:41.758
What?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.803
Are you Patrick Kenzie?

05:46.263 --> 05:48.599
- Yeah.
- Bea and Lionel McCready.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.726
Our niece was kidnapped
three days ago.

05:50.809 --> 05:54.271
Please, come on in. Come on in.
I have to apologize.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.982
You know, there's been some problems
with kids in the neighborhood,

05:57.065 --> 05:59.568
kind of ding-dong ditch,
ringing the buzzer and running away.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.986
So that's the reason for the language.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.446
- Oh.
- Well, we can come back later.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.031
No. Please, please.
Make yourself comfortable.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.824
Here, we're just...
I'm sorry about the mess.

06:05.908 --> 06:09.036
We've been...
I had a late case, and a lot of cases.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.787
We've just been...
We've just been working a lot,

06:10.829 --> 06:14.041
we worked on a case last night,
you know, so we just...

06:14.124 --> 06:16.043
Please sit down, though.

06:19.505 --> 06:20.839
Or...

06:22.007 --> 06:24.801
My associate'll be in in just a minute.
She's in the other room.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.637
How can we help you?

06:27.429 --> 06:28.680
Do you know people
in the neighborhood

06:28.764 --> 06:31.183
who don't talk to the police?

06:31.225 --> 06:32.851
Yeah, one or two.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.023
We wanna hire you to augment
the investigation of Amanda.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.274
Is that right?

06:39.358 --> 06:43.403
You know how in JonBenet Ramsey
the family hired investigators?

06:43.487 --> 06:46.240
So... Are the police all right
with youse hiring outside help?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.784
The police need to worry
about finding my niece.

06:48.867 --> 06:52.037
Hi. I'm Angie Gennaro.
I work with Patrick.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.206
Hello. I'm Bea McCready.
This is my husband, Lionel.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.624
- How do you do?
- They wanna hire us

06:55.707 --> 06:58.752
to augment the investigation.

06:58.836 --> 07:01.255
You should talk
to Precision Investigators.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.965
- Who? I...
- I don't know, I meant...

07:03.048 --> 07:04.216
Well, let's hear them out, Ange.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.927
Well, aren't you
missing persons detectives?

07:07.010 --> 07:08.720
Yeah, that's what your ad says
in the paper.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.223
Yeah, we are.
We are missing persons detectives.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.892
I'm sorry, she...
I think that what Angie means to say is,

07:13.976 --> 07:16.770
just for the sake of disclosure,
up to this point,

07:16.854 --> 07:21.608
our experience has been primarily,
you know, finding missing persons

07:21.692 --> 07:23.569
who've gone missing that they...

07:23.652 --> 07:25.571
You know, they just stop payments on
their Jet Ski

07:25.612 --> 07:26.655
and they went to New Hampshire...

07:26.738 --> 07:31.034
Every police officer in this state
is looking for your niece right now.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.995
And I'm not sure
how much more help we could be.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.538
Well, you're not gonna
do any harm, are you?

07:34.580 --> 07:38.041
All right, look.
I got a pension coming up with Edison.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.544
- So, that's collateral, if...
- No. It's not that.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.422
Why is this so hard?
The cops don't want me coming here.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.798
- Lionel don't want me coming here.
- Don't worry.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.301
- Now you don't want the job?
- No, it's not that we don't want the job...

07:47.384 --> 07:50.888
We consult privately
before we make decisions like these.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.557
- We do.
- Helene puts her to bed.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.727
She goes across to Dottie's.
Maybe gone a half hour, watches TV.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.188
Then she comes home
and Amanda is gone.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.689
<i>She was watching Wife Swap.</i>

08:00.772 --> 08:02.941
She remembers,
'cause that's her favorite show.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.276
And do youse two live upstairs?

08:04.359 --> 08:07.446
Yeah, when our folks died
they left us a unit and my sister a unit,

08:07.529 --> 08:10.199
so, you know,
basically we got no choice.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.450
And with the acoustics
in the apartment,

08:11.533 --> 08:12.576
you can't get away from it.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.453
Why don't you just
come over the house, all right?

08:14.536 --> 08:17.581
- Just talk to Helene, you know.
- Lionel, talk to Helene?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.833
Look, she don't show it,
but she's hurting right now.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.503
- Please. Please!
- All right. Lookit, all right?

08:22.586 --> 08:25.172
I was no saint. All right?
I had my own problems.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.425
I took a hard bust at 22.
Bea straightened me out.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.928
My sister Helene has not had that.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.765
Talking to the mother's
the least we could do.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.975
- We'll come right over.
- Thanks a lot.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.434
Yeah. Pleasure, Lionel.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.729
Oh, you'll find us
in that brown three-decker by the park.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.232
- You know where it is.
- Be hard to miss today.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.170
Look at this. Jesus.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.257
Fucking block party here.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.638
Four Cape Verdeans
got killed here last year.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.640
No one gave a shit.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.773
We have a good life, right?

09:25.774 --> 09:27.860
Is that a trick question?

09:29.903 --> 09:33.282
I don't wanna find their little kid
in a dumpster.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.868
Maybe she's not in a dumpster, babe.

09:36.535 --> 09:40.581
I don't wanna find a little kid after
they've been abused for three days.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.378
Hon, nobody does.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.134
All right.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.179
Listen, we'll just go up
and we'll talk to them,

09:55.220 --> 09:59.141
and you don't wanna do it after that,
I won't argue with you.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.350
Okay.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.030
Hi. Please, come on in.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.367
Helene.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.953
This is Patrick Kenzie,
Angela Gennaro.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.957
- Hi.
- I remember you from high school.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.462
I see you're still a little conceited, huh?

10:28.545 --> 10:29.922
Would you excuse us, Dottie?

10:29.963 --> 10:34.092
Dottie's my best friend, Lionel.
She could be in my house if she wants.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.427
Helene, we don't wanna
get in your hair.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.637
We're just gonna ask you
a couple questions

10:36.720 --> 10:38.472
about your daughter,
then we'll be out of here.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.266
- Everyone wants their part now.
- I know.

10:41.350 --> 10:44.102
I already talked to the cops forty times.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.230
- We're sorry to take up your time.
- Listen, we're not the cops.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.606
Beatrice asked us to come over here

10:47.648 --> 10:50.275
and see if we could help out
finding your daughter.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.779
Why don't Bea mind her business?
It's my kid.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.948
'Cause everyone gotta
have their moment, now.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.074
- Right?
- Right.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.452
Beatrice hired these people to help
find Amanda with her own money,

11:00.536 --> 11:02.496
so you had better show them
the goddamn courtesy

11:02.538 --> 11:04.581
- and respect they deserve!
- She's in grieving, prick.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.041
She could grieve
how she wants, Dottie.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.376
- You don't live here!
- Asshole.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.212
Don't you fucking yell at her, Lionel.
You ain't her father!

11:10.295 --> 11:12.256
Fuck you, Lionel.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.758
Go fuck yourself. Cocksucker.
Fuck you.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.510
Get the fuck outta here.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.220
I'm sorry.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.889
- I'm sorry.
- Maybe we should go.

11:20.973 --> 11:23.433
- I understand. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.477
Maybe we should go?

11:26.228 --> 11:30.065
Look. Can we all just have a few words
in the hallway, please?

11:31.692 --> 11:33.360
Excuse us, Helene.

11:43.871 --> 11:47.124
- Helene's got emotional problems.
- It's not that, Lionel.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.959
- What is it, then?
- She's a cunt!

11:49.001 --> 11:52.462
- Beatrice, don't use that word.
- God help me, it's true.

11:59.845 --> 12:04.725
This is a child.
And I don't know where she is.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.575
Well...

12:26.413 --> 12:28.415
We can't do any harm, right?

12:34.922 --> 12:38.342
It's all right, Bea.
It's all right, Bea. Huh?

12:38.717 --> 12:40.177
Thank you.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.637
Now...

12:43.347 --> 12:48.101
Well, she's quiet.
She tries very hard to be a good girl.

12:49.228 --> 12:52.523
What about Helene? Her friends?
People she hangs out with?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.942
She got a lot of people
come by the house?

12:55.025 --> 12:58.195
I don't know.
She's at the Fillmore all the time.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.989
She's at the Fillmore Lounge?

13:01.073 --> 13:03.033
Yeah, she drinks every day.

13:03.116 --> 13:07.412
She's got the gene, you know?
The disease. Our parents had it, too.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.457
She use drugs?

13:10.541 --> 13:12.292
I think she does a little coke.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.545
How much is a little?

13:14.586 --> 13:20.384
I don't know. Few times a week, maybe.
I mean, how much is a lot?

13:20.425 --> 13:22.886
Few times a week's a lot.

13:22.928 --> 13:26.056
Then she does a lot.
I don't know anything about that.

13:26.098 --> 13:30.519
I put the plug in the jug myself,
I got 23 years sobriety, so, I'm good.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.899
Congratulations.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.112
Do you mind if we see her room?

13:57.171 --> 13:59.965
- Kidnapped the furniture, too?
- Patrick.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.317
<i>10-7 investigation.</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:22.237
Solved it yet?

14:23.363 --> 14:26.742
Captain, Patrick Kenzie.
This is my associate, Angie Gennaro.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.160
Mmm-hmm?

14:28.535 --> 14:31.121
I see Beatrice went on
and hired someone.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.208
I take it that wasn't
your recommendation.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.501
It was not.

14:36.502 --> 14:39.588
That woman would mortgage her home
to every snake doctor

14:39.671 --> 14:42.758
taking credit cards if she thought
it would help find her niece.

14:42.841 --> 14:46.136
My job's hard enough
without inviting the circus in here.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.680
Captain, this isn't
about the money for us.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.936
You ever investigated
an abduction before?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.479
I think Mrs. McCready was hoping
we could help

14:55.521 --> 14:58.732
with the neighborhood aspect of this
investigation, the people, you know.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.400
How old are you?

15:01.527 --> 15:04.363
- I'm 31.
- He just looks young.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.205
A four-year-old child is on the street.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.874
It's 76 hours and counting.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.668
And the prospects
for where she might be

15:17.709 --> 15:20.128
are beginning to look grim,
you understand?

15:20.212 --> 15:24.174
Half of all the children in these cases
are killed, flat out.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.552
If we don't catch the abductor
by day one,

15:26.593 --> 15:29.388
only about 10% are ever solved.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.390
This is day three.

15:34.226 --> 15:37.145
He may look young,

15:37.229 --> 15:40.315
but if he wants to work this case,
he'd better not act it.

15:40.399 --> 15:44.027
Well, he's been hired by a woman
who's the victim of a crime,

15:44.111 --> 15:46.405
and by law he's entitled
as her representative

15:46.488 --> 15:49.491
to be cooperated with
by the Boston Police Department.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.118
So he expects to be.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.330
And he will be.

15:57.082 --> 16:01.920
He and his better half will be contacted
by two of my senior men,

16:01.962 --> 16:05.716
at their convenience,
and be permitted to observe.

16:08.886 --> 16:11.388
We're just trying to help, Captain.

16:13.974 --> 16:18.478
Look, I don't care who does it.
I just want it done.

16:22.608 --> 16:24.151
Good afternoon.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.447
Ready to get started?

16:39.291 --> 16:42.044
All I'm saying is that
we heard Helene comes in here.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.963
We're not asking
for the combination to the safe.

16:45.047 --> 16:49.718
Listen, I ain't saying a fucking word.
I already talked to the fucking cops.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.970
All right.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.473
- Dave, right?
- Big Dave.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.683
Big Dave. All right.

16:56.767 --> 17:00.020
I'm Medium Patrick. Nice to meet you.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.398
You're a little fucking light in the ass
to be talking shit, ain't ya?

17:03.482 --> 17:05.526
Jesus, pal,
I'm just playing.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.694
Listen, buy a couple
of fucking drinks or screw.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.073
Okay, we'll take a couple tonics.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.952
Jesus Christ.

17:15.536 --> 17:19.330
Steve Penteroudakis!
The Grecian Formula!

17:19.373 --> 17:20.915
Oh, shit! What are you doing here?

17:20.999 --> 17:23.335
Look at this little motherfucker
at the Fillmore, what's up?

17:23.417 --> 17:24.627
Gyro!

17:24.670 --> 17:26.797
Beers and keno, 2:00 in the afternoon.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.173
- What up?
- Oh, yeah.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.717
Yeah, listen,
I been fucking everywhere

17:30.801 --> 17:33.846
putting up posters, man, you know?

17:33.887 --> 17:37.808
Every project hallway,
all over City Point, everywhere.

17:37.850 --> 17:38.892
You know? I mean, it's a real tragedy.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.853
She used to come in here,
sit up at the bar and shit.

17:40.936 --> 17:44.147
- You know, she was like our mascot.
- Helene brought Amanda in here?

17:44.189 --> 17:48.068
No, mostly in the afternoons.
I mean, it's no place for a child at night.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.695
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

17:49.778 --> 17:53.198
Hot tempers, lot of drugs, trust me.

17:53.282 --> 17:55.784
So how often Helene come down here?

17:55.868 --> 17:57.202
Five nights a week.

17:57.286 --> 18:00.163
Come on, guys, please.
She's a fucking coke ho, okay?

18:00.205 --> 18:02.416
She's in here fucking doing lines
just about every night.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.459
Trust me, all right?
It's not a real shocker, so...

18:04.543 --> 18:07.379
- She's that bad, huh?
- Huh?

18:07.462 --> 18:09.173
Oh, she's fucking terrible.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.967
Listen, remember that night
when the kid got kidnapped?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.051
You saw her on the news, right?

18:13.135 --> 18:16.847
She's saying, "Oh, I was at my
neighbor's house for a half hour."

18:16.930 --> 18:21.018
Bullshit. She was in here for, like,
two hours bumping rails. Oh, yeah.

18:21.059 --> 18:24.563
- What time did she come in?
- 8:00.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.773
- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

18:26.857 --> 18:29.943
'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

18:30.027 --> 18:31.570
and I was banging on the fucking door.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.864
- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

18:33.906 --> 18:35.699
He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

18:35.741 --> 18:36.742
I was banging on the door.

18:36.825 --> 18:37.868
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

18:37.951 --> 18:39.536
but I know he's fucking in there.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.664
- Don't lend him any money...
- Hey, Stevie.

18:42.748 --> 18:46.710
- What the fuck you doing?
- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.879
Don't talk about people you don't know.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.214
What do you mean?
These are my friends.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.424
- I know them for years.
- What's the problem, guy?

18:52.925 --> 18:54.760
You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.513
- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

18:57.596 --> 18:59.431
Why don't you mind your business?

18:59.473 --> 19:01.850
He's gonna come in here
and be a smartass?

19:01.934 --> 19:04.269
You're awfully worried
about people's asses there, Dave.

19:04.353 --> 19:07.648
Yeah, you probably got
a fucking ass like a Skippy jar.

19:07.731 --> 19:11.527
What are you doing here, anyway?
Dave can't make a martini worth a shit.

19:11.610 --> 19:14.238
Trying to help Helene
find her daughter. Is that all right?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.697
Listen, don't come in here
running your mouth,

19:15.781 --> 19:17.449
thinking you're better than me.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.701
I'm not the fucking one.

19:19.785 --> 19:21.662
- All right, just cool it.
- Cool it.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.623
- Listen to this douchebag.
- Bet she fucks this asshole in half.

19:24.665 --> 19:27.835
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
is the matter with you guys?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.212
You, you punk fucking jackass.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.265
We're leaving, all right?

19:44.476 --> 19:47.396
You know, Dave,
I think it's your good looks...

19:49.523 --> 19:52.734
'Cause there is some fine pussy
in here tonight.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.662
Open that door, rummy.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.666
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

20:20.012 --> 20:22.014
You ever wanna get fucked,
let me know.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.478
How's that, motherfucker?
Now you know.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.523
Keep your fucking mouths closed.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.442
What, you wanna
say some shit, Fat Dave?

20:33.525 --> 20:34.526
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

20:34.610 --> 20:36.862
Make me a martini,
you fucking fat bastard!

20:36.945 --> 20:37.988
- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

20:38.030 --> 20:41.325
Make me a fucking martini,
you fat fucking retard!

20:41.533 --> 20:43.577
Fucking unbelievable.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.949
- Can I help you?
- You Detective Bressant?

21:22.032 --> 21:25.035
- That's right.
- Patrick Kenzie. Did you just call me?

21:25.118 --> 21:28.580
Oh, sorry.
Sergeant Detective Remy Bressant.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.624
How you doing?

21:31.416 --> 21:33.836
- Should we... Sit down?
- Something wrong?

21:34.002 --> 21:35.546
No! I just...

21:35.587 --> 21:38.549
I think Nick was expecting
an older couple, maybe.

21:39.758 --> 21:41.093
Life's full of surprises.

21:41.635 --> 21:44.763
Corwin Earle.
Serial molester, recently work-released.

21:45.097 --> 21:47.349
Went AWOL around the time
Amanda disappeared.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.768
Known associates, Leon Trett

21:51.186 --> 21:54.064
and his handsome wife, Roberta.

21:55.357 --> 21:58.735
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

21:58.777 --> 21:59.945
They have drug habits.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.781
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

22:02.865 --> 22:06.451
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

22:06.535 --> 22:10.205
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

22:10.789 --> 22:11.957
Apparently the three of them

22:12.040 --> 22:15.002
<i>have some kind of
Addams Family deal going on.</i>

22:15.085 --> 22:18.463
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.967
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

22:22.009 --> 22:23.302
Do you think
this is who has Amanda?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.803
Well, there's a lot
of holes in our theory.

22:24.887 --> 22:27.097
I mean, Corwin likes
little boys, you know?

22:27.139 --> 22:30.017
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

22:31.977 --> 22:35.355
So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

22:35.439 --> 22:36.481
No, we got more.

22:36.565 --> 22:39.109
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

22:39.193 --> 22:40.903
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

22:40.986 --> 22:42.654
we've interviewed every neighbor
in a mile radius

22:42.696 --> 22:44.448
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

22:44.489 --> 22:46.200
who just happened
to cut off his ankle bracelet.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.326
- Take it easy...
- No, no, no, no, no!

22:47.409 --> 22:49.411
Who the fuck is this guy?

22:50.704 --> 22:53.040
You're here because Jack Doyle
had us extend you a courtesy.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.833
You got something to contribute,
you know, be my guest.

22:54.917 --> 22:56.335
Otherwise, hey, you...

22:56.376 --> 22:59.713
You know, you can go back
to your Harry Potter book.

23:00.631 --> 23:03.675
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

23:03.842 --> 23:07.054
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

23:07.137 --> 23:09.431
that are capable of doing this.

23:10.224 --> 23:13.101
So then you probably
talked to Ray Likanski.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.354
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

23:15.938 --> 23:19.942
"Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",
about 160 pounds.

23:20.025 --> 23:23.445
Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?

23:23.779 --> 23:26.698
- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

23:26.740 --> 23:28.909
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.578
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

23:31.662 --> 23:33.163
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

23:33.247 --> 23:35.541
doing coke for two hours,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.959
Fascinating.

23:38.252 --> 23:41.213
- With Helene McCready.
- You're shitting me.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.217
She did bullshit us.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.553
I'm gonna have to tear her
a new asshole.

23:47.636 --> 23:49.179
Meet you down there.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.477
So what kinda name is Bressant?

23:55.561 --> 23:57.688
It's the kind they give you in Louisiana.

23:57.771 --> 23:59.356
Oh, yeah?
Thought you were from here.

23:59.439 --> 24:02.276
Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

24:02.860 --> 24:07.698
I mean, you might think that you're
more from here than me, for example.

24:08.198 --> 24:10.868
But I been living here
longer than you been alive.

24:12.119 --> 24:13.412
So who's right?

24:13.495 --> 24:14.955
I'll mull it over.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.082
- What's up, sucker?
- Bubba.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.500
- Good to see you, brother.
- Good to see you.

24:18.584 --> 24:20.043
- How you been? You been good?
- Yeah.

24:20.127 --> 24:22.504
Yeah? What's up, Angie?
How you doing, baby?

24:23.213 --> 24:25.424
You seen those people?

24:26.258 --> 24:30.220
Drug addict, drug addict, fucking...
Pedophile.

24:30.304 --> 24:33.348
What the fuck makes you think
I know people like this?

24:33.432 --> 24:36.226
Bub, I know you don't pay your rent
doing people's taxes.

24:36.268 --> 24:38.145
Yeah, I don't pay my rent
selling penny rocks

24:38.228 --> 24:39.813
to walleyed child molesters, neither.

24:39.897 --> 24:41.899
They're not all three child molesters.

24:42.232 --> 24:45.319
Just... Just this one, Corwin Earle.

24:45.402 --> 24:48.739
The other two are just baseheads
he hangs out with.

24:48.906 --> 24:50.449
What are the two of yas,
crime dogs, now?

24:50.532 --> 24:53.118
We got hired to find that little girl.

24:53.202 --> 24:55.078
Turns out the mother was down
at the Fillmore all night

24:55.120 --> 24:56.121
while the kid was taken.

24:56.205 --> 24:58.957
- With Skinny Ray.
- Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.

24:59.041 --> 25:01.752
- I thought Ray was your boy.
- Work for me?

25:01.919 --> 25:04.796
Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.
He works for the Haitian.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.131
Ray works for Cheese?

25:06.215 --> 25:10.761
Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,
whole trash-picker crew.

25:10.844 --> 25:12.513
Did you ever sell to Helene?

25:12.596 --> 25:14.556
There's reasons why
there ain't three inches of Plexiglas

25:14.640 --> 25:16.350
between us right now.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.644
That's 'cause I don't fuck
with skeezers like Helene.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.229
Or coconuts like Cheese.

25:20.312 --> 25:21.313
You should know better by now.

25:21.396 --> 25:23.815
I'm the king of this
motherfucking jungle.

25:23.857 --> 25:26.485
I'll let you know
if I hear anything, though.

25:26.527 --> 25:27.736
- Thanks, bro.
- Peace.

25:28.529 --> 25:30.656
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

25:31.698 --> 25:34.451
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

25:35.577 --> 25:37.496
- Who?
- Come on, sweetheart.

25:37.538 --> 25:40.332
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

25:42.668 --> 25:44.211
Oh, sounds familiar.

25:44.294 --> 25:48.966
No. No.
It don't "sound familiar," Helene.

25:49.007 --> 25:55.389
He's a violent, sociopathic
Haitian criminal named "Cheese."

25:56.849 --> 25:59.226
Either you know him or you don't.

26:01.728 --> 26:02.855
Who is he?

26:02.938 --> 26:05.315
He's a drug lord
or something, isn't he?

26:05.357 --> 26:07.025
Helene, who is he?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.570
- He's just a guy, Lionel.
- Thank you.

26:09.653 --> 26:13.156
He is, among other things,
Mrs. McCready, a drug dealer, yes.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.201
- What other things?
- I don't know.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.120
Why don't you answer
your brother's questions, Helene?

26:18.203 --> 26:19.746
Why don't you go
suck a nigger's dick, Bea?

26:19.830 --> 26:22.124
You listen to me!
You don't disrespect my wife,

26:22.207 --> 26:23.959
and you don't make racial remarks
in my kitchen.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.377
- Who is this man?
- It's my kitchen, Lionel.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.503
You know what I mean!

26:26.587 --> 26:28.338
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

26:28.380 --> 26:31.300
He's a drug dealer, a pimp,
a pornographer. All right?

26:31.383 --> 26:32.843
Perfect.
You associate with a pimp.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.678
A pornographer? Helene.

26:34.761 --> 26:37.055
And we think he rolled up
Pokey Jackson in a carpet

26:37.097 --> 26:39.725
and shot him in the head
on Castlegate, so there's that, too.

26:39.808 --> 26:41.685
What do you do for him?

26:42.936 --> 26:44.855
I just mule.

26:44.897 --> 26:46.690
Occasionally, not making
a habit out of it.

26:46.732 --> 26:49.484
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Lionel, what does that mean?

26:49.568 --> 26:52.529
It means she's a drug runner, Bea.
It means she carries drugs.

26:52.613 --> 26:55.073
- Isn't that right, Helene?
- Oh, my God, a few times.

26:55.115 --> 26:58.202
- Where?
- Providence...

26:58.285 --> 26:59.953
Does it fucking matter?

27:00.037 --> 27:01.246
You think I'm fucking around, here?

27:01.288 --> 27:04.750
You think I'm playing games, here?
'Course it matters.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.672
Better answer
his question, Helene.

27:10.756 --> 27:13.217
- For what?
- Fuck's sake, Lionel.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.929
- What do you think? Money, taste.
- Of what, drugs?

27:17.012 --> 27:18.931
No, little puffy heart stickers
for my locker.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.933
What kind of drugs?
Cocaine and heroin.

27:21.016 --> 27:25.812
- No, I would've seen the track marks.
- Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?

27:25.896 --> 27:28.273
Yeah, less addictive that way.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.402
Piece of work.

27:36.198 --> 27:37.824
What the fuck is that?
Where are you going?

27:43.914 --> 27:47.084
Oh, yeah.
I keep thinking about this thing I heard.

27:48.627 --> 27:50.963
- You know where I'm going with this?
- No.

27:51.046 --> 27:53.757
Did you know I used to work DCU?

27:53.799 --> 27:56.593
- I give a fuck.
- Okay.

27:57.719 --> 28:00.764
So, I still know some of those guys
real well.

28:01.682 --> 28:03.559
Anyway, I heard someone
ripped Cheese off

28:03.642 --> 28:05.602
on a New Hampshire run.

28:05.936 --> 28:08.605
- Did you hear anything about that?
- No.

28:08.689 --> 28:12.234
- Care to take a polygraph?
- I already took one.

28:12.317 --> 28:14.695
Different questions this time.

28:14.778 --> 28:17.906
Come on. It's all right.

28:19.032 --> 28:22.828
We don't care about a
couple of hopheads beating each other.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.872
We care about your child.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.249
So come on.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.668
How much?

28:32.421 --> 28:34.882
You even give a fuck about your kid?

28:36.008 --> 28:37.551
'Course I do.

28:37.634 --> 28:42.931
And we know you took the money.
So just tell us how much you took.

28:43.015 --> 28:44.349
How much?

28:48.604 --> 28:49.980
How much?

28:51.732 --> 28:53.025
How much?

28:54.860 --> 28:56.653
One thirty.

29:02.868 --> 29:07.456
- $ 130,000?
- Yes, Bea.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.166
How'd you do it?

29:14.087 --> 29:16.548
Me and Ray had to do this
run up Nashua, right?

29:16.632 --> 29:18.008
Yeah.

29:18.050 --> 29:20.677
We dropped four ki's on these bikers.

29:20.761 --> 29:23.430
When we was walking back
through the motel with all the money,

29:23.514 --> 29:26.767
these cops just swooped right in,
went right for the bikers,

29:26.850 --> 29:31.772
and Amanda was with us,
so we just pretended to be like a family.

29:31.897 --> 29:35.067
- And we got in the car, took off.
- You took Amanda with you?

29:35.150 --> 29:38.362
Oh, what am I gonna do?
Leave her in the car, Bea?

29:39.279 --> 29:41.198
I don't got no daycare.

29:42.074 --> 29:46.828
It's really hard being a mother.
It's hard raising a family, you know?

29:47.996 --> 29:49.998
All on my own.

29:50.082 --> 29:52.584
But God made you barren,
so you wouldn't fucking know.

29:52.668 --> 29:54.711
- So I understand, Bea, okay?
- You are an abomination.

29:54.795 --> 29:56.380
- Hey, hey, hey. Right here.
- As God is my witness.

29:56.421 --> 29:58.549
Right here. What happened next?

30:00.133 --> 30:05.389
We was driving back,
and Ray, fucking Ray was like,

30:05.472 --> 30:08.392
"You know everyone's gonna think
the cops got the money."

30:08.475 --> 30:10.477
You told Cheese the cops got it.

30:10.561 --> 30:12.437
But you and Ray
kept the money.

30:13.605 --> 30:18.360
- This whole fucking thing is Ray's fault.
- Where's the money now, Helene?

30:21.071 --> 30:23.490
- It's with Ray.
- And where's Ray?

30:26.451 --> 30:29.162
- Chelsea.
- Let's go. Come on.

30:29.246 --> 30:31.832
She rides with you.
I don't want her in my car.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.020
- Go on. Move your bike!
- Go fuck your mother.

30:53.103 --> 30:55.689
- What the...
- Beat it, sucker!

31:01.528 --> 31:03.989
Helene, you used to go
with Scott Flaherty, didn't you?

31:04.031 --> 31:06.533
- How do you know?
- You know, I went to Saint Mark's.

31:06.617 --> 31:09.578
I was a freshman when you were
a senior. You don't remember me?

31:09.661 --> 31:10.787
No.

31:11.955 --> 31:14.166
Whatever happened to Scott?

31:14.249 --> 31:17.336
He stabbed a foreign exchange student
in the chest.

31:17.377 --> 31:20.672
He got life in Walpole.
He's a faggot now.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.843
He was kind of a faggot in high school.

31:24.927 --> 31:29.932
Oh, man.
You're terrible. He was cute.

31:30.849 --> 31:32.684
Well, he kind of wore them tight shorts.

31:32.726 --> 31:36.104
Oh, who's a faggot now?
You're dating a faggot.

31:40.317 --> 31:42.653
So, how did the...
How'd the money end up in Chelsea?

31:42.736 --> 31:45.113
I thought youse and...
You and Ray went home after.

31:45.197 --> 31:48.033
No, we dropped off Amanda
and went back to Ray's.

31:48.075 --> 31:51.161
But fucking retarded Ray
left his baby rock at my place.

31:51.245 --> 31:54.164
You know, right then, I'm like,
"I'm gonna drop this motherfucker.

31:54.206 --> 31:56.875
"I don't care if he does got a big dick."

31:56.917 --> 32:00.546
So we went back to the apartment
and Ray was hollering,

32:00.629 --> 32:03.590
he was gonna wake up Amanda,
she needs her sleep, you know?

32:03.674 --> 32:06.552
So, we went back to Ray's,

32:06.635 --> 32:08.554
- or Ray's mother's. Whatever.
- Yeah?

32:08.595 --> 32:12.015
I don't know where that mother went,
but she left all her fucking cats in there,

32:12.057 --> 32:14.017
and it smells like cock.

32:15.143 --> 32:17.729
And Cheese never contacted you,
never left you a note?

32:17.813 --> 32:19.523
No.
We didn't hear nothing from Cheese.

32:19.565 --> 32:21.316
That's why Ray said, "Don't say shit."

32:21.400 --> 32:23.235
You didn't think it was worth it
for your daughter's sake

32:23.318 --> 32:26.697
to tell people what happened?
Cheese has your kid.

32:28.448 --> 32:31.618
God fucking knows
what he's doing to her.

32:31.702 --> 32:32.953
What am I gonna do?

32:33.036 --> 32:35.497
Call Cheese and be like,
"You got my daughter?

32:35.581 --> 32:37.249
"'Cause I just ripped you off,
and I'm just checking."

32:37.332 --> 32:38.375
Yeah!

32:38.417 --> 32:40.252
- Helene, sit back.
- Oh, my God!

32:40.335 --> 32:43.755
Oh, I'm gonna call the cops, too,
and be like, "You know,

32:43.839 --> 32:47.050
"just so you know, wanna know
I run coke and heroin

32:47.092 --> 32:48.427
"in case that's irrelevant."

32:48.510 --> 32:49.761
All right, calm down.
Calm down.

32:49.845 --> 32:51.180
You make me sick.

32:53.265 --> 32:56.059
What makes you think Ray hasn't
spent all the money, Helene?

32:56.101 --> 32:58.353
Nigger, please. I hid it.

32:58.437 --> 32:59.605
Pull over.

33:25.589 --> 33:28.217
Looks like somebody had a little talk
with Ray before they shot him.

33:28.300 --> 33:31.595
- Looks like he held out pretty good.
- He didn't have it.

33:33.597 --> 33:36.475
He couldn't tell them where the money
was, because he didn't know.

33:36.558 --> 33:38.101
Helene hid it.

33:39.561 --> 33:42.231
Ray made poor relationship choices.

33:42.689 --> 33:45.651
Guess they didn't believe him.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.152
Poor prick.

33:47.194 --> 33:49.613
I'm not waiting
in a fucking car.

34:05.003 --> 34:08.674
- Where's the money, Helene?
- I give a fuck about the money.

34:09.466 --> 34:12.052
- Helene...
- I just want my daughter home with me.

34:12.135 --> 34:16.556
I know it. I know, I'm... I'm sorry.
It's very upsetting about Ray. But...

34:17.516 --> 34:19.393
- Where's the money?
- It's right there.

34:19.476 --> 34:22.855
- Where?
- Buried it when Ray was passed out.

34:23.605 --> 34:24.648
What was that book about,

34:24.690 --> 34:27.775
<i>Everything You Need
Is in Your Own Backyard?</i>

34:27.860 --> 34:31.196
- I think it was a French book.
- Yeah, that wasn't a book.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.407
- That was a book.
- No, it was a cartoon.

34:33.489 --> 34:34.992
- The fuck out of here.
- No, it was a cartoon.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.286
- Right, Helene?
- Fuck youse both.

34:37.369 --> 34:38.495
Should we bring in the FBI
at this point?

34:38.579 --> 34:40.873
- That's the worst thing we could do.
- Why is that?

34:40.914 --> 34:42.748
'Cause I don't wanna see Cheese
kill Amanda

34:42.833 --> 34:44.126
after he opens a bag
full of newspapers.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.627
It's kidnapping.

34:45.710 --> 34:49.339
- I don't see a note. You see a note?
- Nope. No note.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.675
We're investigating
a missing children's case, here.

34:51.717 --> 34:55.137
Kidnapping has nothing to do with it.
Fastest way to get Amanda home

34:55.219 --> 34:58.182
is go to Cheese,
swap the money for her and walk away.

34:58.265 --> 35:01.727
- Plain and simple.
- Do you know Cheese?

35:01.768 --> 35:05.230
Knew his brother better, Jude.
He was a sweet kid.

35:05.314 --> 35:07.274
Cheese went another way.

35:08.317 --> 35:11.695
- He wouldn't hurt her, right?
- Ask Ray.

35:11.778 --> 35:13.572
All right, listen.
All he cares about is his money.

35:13.655 --> 35:16.074
If he gets it back...
He's not gonna hurt Amanda.

35:16.116 --> 35:19.661
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?
We'll get her back. It'll be fine.

35:19.745 --> 35:22.039
- Oh, you're gonna talk to him?
- Yeah, that's the idea.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.249
Okay. Well, tell him I'm sorry, all right?

35:24.333 --> 35:27.002
I mean, he knows me,
just tell him I apologize.

35:27.085 --> 35:29.922
Yeah, I'm sure that'll fix everything.
Just take her home.

35:29.963 --> 35:33.091
- We'll take care of this, all right?
- We'll meet you over there.

35:33.175 --> 35:34.593
I'm hungry.

35:34.635 --> 35:35.928
All right. I'll get you something, Helene.

35:36.011 --> 35:37.638
No, her.

35:37.721 --> 35:39.681
That's what she said to me
right before I put her to bed.

35:39.765 --> 35:42.267
She said, "I'm hungry."
I mean, they fed her, right?

35:42.351 --> 35:44.436
She's not still hungry?

35:45.812 --> 35:47.105
I don't know.

36:34.319 --> 36:36.154
I know I fucked up.

36:37.281 --> 36:38.490
I just want my daughter back.

36:38.574 --> 36:42.369
I swear to God,
I won't use no drugs no more.

36:42.452 --> 36:44.288
I won't even go out,
I'll be fucking straight.

36:44.329 --> 36:45.956
Cross my heart.

36:47.249 --> 36:49.293
It's all right.
We're gonna find her, Helene.

36:49.376 --> 36:51.420
You have to. You promise?

36:53.297 --> 36:56.216
Yeah. I'm gonna try. I will.

36:57.551 --> 37:00.762
Promise. You have to promise me.

37:02.514 --> 37:03.807
I promise.

37:08.812 --> 37:09.897
All right.

37:27.289 --> 37:28.290
<i>Where do you
think you're going?</i>

37:28.373 --> 37:29.374
<i>Talk to Cheese.</i>

37:29.458 --> 37:31.126
<i>No, you're not.
No, get back in the car.</i>

37:31.210 --> 37:33.754
<i>No, that's a mistake.
He's never gonna talk to a badge.</i>

37:33.837 --> 37:35.214
<i>No. No way.
It's too important.</i>

37:35.297 --> 37:36.840
<i>You wanna get the girl back, or not?</i>

37:37.341 --> 37:39.009
<i>I know him.
If there's a deal to be brokered,</i>

37:39.092 --> 37:41.178
- we're the ones who can do it.
- No, me and Nick are handling this.

37:41.220 --> 37:42.221
Get back in the car.

37:42.304 --> 37:45.057
Guys, you two go in there
and negotiate a ransom for a little girl,

37:45.140 --> 37:48.560
then it is the FBI.
'Cause it's kidnapping.

37:48.602 --> 37:49.770
All you're gonna do
is scare him.

37:49.853 --> 37:52.564
The more you scare him,
the worse it is for her.

37:57.319 --> 37:59.071
All right. Go ahead.

37:59.571 --> 38:03.867
Just fucking relax, sit tight. I know him.
I'm gonna take care of it.

38:03.909 --> 38:05.410
Good luck.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.544
It's been a long time.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.799
No. I quit.

38:25.889 --> 38:28.267
I'm gonna talk some private shit.

38:29.852 --> 38:34.398
- Don't wait, but don't get too far.
- You know I'll be right here.

38:36.483 --> 38:38.861
Bitches love the cheddar.

38:44.783 --> 38:47.870
- How you been, Chris?
- Better than you.

38:50.289 --> 38:52.374
Yeah. Good to hear it.

38:52.457 --> 38:55.544
- Fuck you.
- Man, be cool.

38:55.627 --> 38:59.506
It's been too long not to see a fool.

38:59.590 --> 39:01.592
I grant you audience.

39:02.718 --> 39:03.719
Go.

39:05.220 --> 39:08.348
We found what you
were looking for in Chelsea.

39:09.641 --> 39:11.518
What I care about Chelsea?

39:11.602 --> 39:14.813
'Cause one of the idiots
that robbed you lived there.

39:14.855 --> 39:16.815
What idiot?

39:16.857 --> 39:20.944
The one that you and Chris
beat with a pipe and shot in the chest.

39:22.905 --> 39:26.116
I don't know about nobody getting kill.

39:27.075 --> 39:29.828
But if somebody rob me
and end up dead...

39:30.996 --> 39:35.042
Well, you know, life is a motherfucker.

39:37.544 --> 39:41.757
Cheese, we got your money.
It was buried in Ray's backyard.

39:43.175 --> 39:46.678
We wanna give it back to you
in exchange for Amanda McCready.

39:46.845 --> 39:50.140
The two police outside
are the only other people who know.

39:50.182 --> 39:52.643
No one gives a fuck
about what you did.

39:52.726 --> 39:54.853
I mean, I didn't even
like Ray that much.

39:54.937 --> 39:57.689
You're gonna get your money,
the mother gets her daughter back,

39:57.773 --> 39:59.733
and we'll say we found the kid
in the bushes, or whatever.

40:00.943 --> 40:02.903
It's either this, real quiet,

40:02.986 --> 40:05.197
or it's a thousand fucking cops
kicking your door in,

40:05.280 --> 40:07.783
putting their fat knees in your neck.

40:11.245 --> 40:12.496
Hold up.

40:14.831 --> 40:16.917
Whoa. Whoa.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.837
What the fuck is this?

40:21.129 --> 40:22.714
Lift up your shirt.

40:23.882 --> 40:26.635
- Come on, man.
- Motherfucker, you heard me.

40:27.386 --> 40:29.096
Lift up your shirt.

40:30.138 --> 40:33.684
- It ain't like that, Cheese.
- My CC, I ain't down with you.

40:34.017 --> 40:35.769
Lift up your shirt.

40:42.067 --> 40:43.610
You, too, baby.
Ain't no gender immunity.

40:43.694 --> 40:45.195
Let me see some tit.

40:51.535 --> 40:54.121
Don't ever come in my spot like that.

40:57.416 --> 40:59.042
You got my money,

40:59.126 --> 41:02.921
you leave that shit in the mailbox
on your ass way out, you feel me?

41:03.046 --> 41:04.923
Some other motherfuckers
let fool rob on them.

41:05.007 --> 41:07.217
I don't play scrimmage.

41:07.301 --> 41:09.553
But I don't fuck with no kids.

41:12.848 --> 41:18.270
And if that girl only hope is you,
well, I pray for her,

41:18.353 --> 41:20.230
'cause she's gone, baby.

41:21.356 --> 41:22.524
Gone.

41:32.951 --> 41:34.995
Cheese, if you ever
disrespect her again like that,

41:35.078 --> 41:37.664
I'm gonna pull your fucking card.

41:37.748 --> 41:38.874
Okay?

41:44.755 --> 41:47.382
So you're saying you didn't do it, fine.

41:47.466 --> 41:50.511
We'll take your money,
and we'll be on our way.

41:51.470 --> 41:53.472
But if it turns out you're lying,

41:53.555 --> 41:56.225
I'm going to spend every nickel
of that money to fuck you up.

41:56.308 --> 41:57.976
I'm gonna bribe cops to go after you,

41:58.060 --> 42:00.521
I'm gonna pay guys
to go after your weak fucking crew,

42:00.604 --> 42:03.690
and I'm gonna tell everyone I know
that you're a CI and a rat.

42:03.774 --> 42:05.859
And I know a lot of people.

42:06.485 --> 42:08.612
And after that, you're gonna wish
you had listened to me,

42:08.695 --> 42:11.448
'cause your shitty, pool-hall,
crime-syndicate headquarters

42:11.532 --> 42:12.908
is gonna get raided.

42:12.991 --> 42:15.494
And your doped-up bitches
are gonna get sent back to Laos,

42:15.577 --> 42:17.996
and this fucking retard right here
is gonna be testifying against you

42:18.080 --> 42:20.499
for a reduced sentence while you're
getting cornholed in your cell

42:20.541 --> 42:22.251
by a gang of crackers.

42:24.419 --> 42:26.338
'Cause from what I heard,

42:26.421 --> 42:29.716
you guys that get sent up Concord
for killing kids,

42:29.800 --> 42:31.593
life a motherfucker.

42:42.980 --> 42:46.400
If I see you again,
I'm gonna get discourteous on you.

42:58.745 --> 43:00.914
And get that sausage off my lawn.

43:01.832 --> 43:04.543
- Well, what happened?
- He said he didn't know anything,

43:04.626 --> 43:07.379
but if you had his money,
you could put it in his mailbox.

43:07.462 --> 43:10.382
- That's what he told you?
- That's it.

43:10.424 --> 43:12.426
Nothing else?

43:12.509 --> 43:15.846
Yeah. He said that he wanted
you two off his lawn.

43:17.264 --> 43:19.183
I thought you said
you knew this fucking guy.

43:19.266 --> 43:21.476
Half the guys he knows
are degenerates.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.187
Yeah, you know
what the other half are?

43:23.228 --> 43:26.273
- What?
- Cops. Don't hold it against me.

43:26.899 --> 43:31.236
No, no. I won't hold it against you.

43:32.696 --> 43:35.115
You know what I'll hold against you?

43:35.199 --> 43:39.703
We had one chance to make this deal.
You said you knew him.

43:39.745 --> 43:42.748
You said you could do it
and you fucked it up.

43:43.415 --> 43:45.792
Now I gotta get a warrant for a tap,
start surveillance,

43:45.876 --> 43:47.753
hope to Christ we get lucky.

43:47.794 --> 43:49.880
You know, if Amanda
dies because of this,

43:51.965 --> 43:53.842
I won't have to hold it against you.

43:55.135 --> 43:58.555
You'll hold it against yourself
for a long, long time.

44:25.123 --> 44:27.334
Hope we didn't fuck this up.

44:36.802 --> 44:39.054
- Yeah.
- Cheese called in.

44:39.137 --> 44:41.974
<i>Says he'll take the deal with Amanda,
but he wants to go tonight.</i>

44:42.015 --> 44:44.643
- Great.
- Well, it is and it isn't.

44:44.726 --> 44:47.437
They record calls at the station now.

44:47.479 --> 44:50.065
<i>- Jack got a hold of the transcript.
- What does that mean?</i>

44:50.148 --> 44:53.193
It means our badges are
basically fucking forfeit at this point.

44:53.277 --> 44:55.153
<i>He wants you both down here, now.</i>

44:55.195 --> 44:57.322
Oh, and, hey, Cheese said
he left something in a mailbox

44:57.406 --> 44:59.783
to prove that he's got Amanda.

45:21.221 --> 45:25.309
This is a transcript of a recorded call
that came in this morning.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.647
Care to read the highlighted portion?

45:32.816 --> 45:34.151
Aloud?

45:35.235 --> 45:36.570
Uh.

45:37.696 --> 45:42.075
Bitch,
you better have my money.

45:45.037 --> 45:47.206
"Detective Bressant: Who is this?

45:47.247 --> 45:50.834
"The caller:
You know who the fuck this is, fool...

45:50.876 --> 45:53.378
"Creole curse words.
If you want that girl back,

45:53.462 --> 45:55.923
"you need to meet me up
Quincy tonight.

45:56.006 --> 45:58.509
"Fuck around for a minute
and I'll throw that girl in the lake."

45:58.592 --> 46:02.179
The lake he refers to is the water
in the abandoned quarry.

46:03.555 --> 46:07.935
Detective Bressant goes on to make
an unauthorized ransom arrangement

46:08.018 --> 46:11.730
to exchange Amanda McCready
for $ 130,000 tonight

46:11.813 --> 46:13.857
in just that location.

46:14.858 --> 46:18.445
After some discussion,
Detective Bressant was kind enough

46:18.529 --> 46:20.197
to produce this.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.449
Recognize it?

46:22.533 --> 46:25.619
The four of you have involved me
in an illegal activity

46:25.702 --> 46:29.206
without my knowledge or consent,
and I don't fucking appreciate it.

46:29.248 --> 46:32.751
- You don't have to be a part of it, sir.
- The hell I don't.

46:32.835 --> 46:34.586
If I delay this now, after this agreement,

46:34.628 --> 46:37.339
I just further endanger
the life of that child.

46:37.422 --> 46:40.259
Does that sound like something
you expect me to do?

46:40.342 --> 46:41.677
No, sir.

46:42.511 --> 46:44.179
I went in there. I'll accept responsibility.

46:44.263 --> 46:46.098
You'll accept nothing!

46:46.390 --> 46:48.892
Don't come in here
trying to get noble, boy.

46:51.103 --> 46:52.896
Let me see that note.

47:00.112 --> 47:01.238
My God.

47:04.449 --> 47:06.451
He wants to separate us.

47:06.535 --> 47:09.246
The note instructs you guys to be
on the east side and wait for Amanda,

47:09.329 --> 47:12.666
me and Nick to be at the clearing
by the edge with the money.

47:12.749 --> 47:15.544
Once Amanda's turned over to you,
you give us a call on the radio,

47:15.627 --> 47:17.421
we turn over the cash.

47:18.839 --> 47:21.633
- Who's he likely to bring with him?
- Chris Mullen.

47:21.717 --> 47:23.844
He was at the club
when we made the offer.

47:23.927 --> 47:25.554
What do you know about him?

47:25.637 --> 47:28.557
It was probably him
who killed Ray for Cheese.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.808
If I had to guess.

47:29.892 --> 47:32.644
All right.
Nobody else knows about this, right?

47:32.728 --> 47:35.147
- I don't know.
- Yes?

47:35.230 --> 47:39.318
I'm asking if keeping it quiet is better
for Amanda or is it better for us?

47:40.652 --> 47:43.697
Do you have any children,
Miss Gennaro?

47:43.780 --> 47:45.324
No, sir.

47:46.825 --> 47:51.330
My only child was murdered.
She was 12. Did you hear about it?

47:53.165 --> 47:54.374
What you probably didn't hear,

47:54.458 --> 47:55.667
and what I hope
you never have to deal with,

47:55.751 --> 47:59.171
Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.
What I have to deal with.

48:00.047 --> 48:03.800
Knowing that my little girl likely died

48:03.842 --> 48:06.470
crying out for me
to come and save her.

48:07.429 --> 48:09.056
And I never did.

48:09.806 --> 48:16.063
My little girl died afraid and alone
in a shallow ditch bank

48:16.146 --> 48:19.691
by the side of the road
not 10 minutes from my house.

48:23.111 --> 48:25.948
I know what it feels like to lose a child.

48:28.575 --> 48:31.745
Now, damn it, you force my hand

48:31.828 --> 48:34.122
and then you question
the way I handle it.

48:34.206 --> 48:36.375
No one's questioning you, sir.

48:36.458 --> 48:39.211
I honor my child with this division.

48:40.420 --> 48:43.340
So that no parent
has to go through what I've known.

48:44.383 --> 48:46.260
This child.

48:49.388 --> 48:51.056
That's all I care about.

48:51.932 --> 48:53.976
I'm gonna bring her home.

49:09.741 --> 49:12.369
Why'd he bring us all the way up here?

49:14.580 --> 49:17.165
I don't know. It's big. It's dark.
It's easy to get away.

49:17.249 --> 49:18.292
No.

49:20.961 --> 49:22.921
They're gonna kill her.

49:46.320 --> 49:50.449
This asshole could've found
some level fucking ground somewhere.

49:50.532 --> 49:54.536
This is where we part ways.
You guys'll be on top of that cliff.

49:54.620 --> 49:56.663
We'll be right across from you.

49:56.747 --> 49:59.791
Give us a call on the radio
when you have her.

50:00.876 --> 50:03.378
- We will.
- Well, good luck.

50:06.298 --> 50:07.633
Let's go.

50:46.547 --> 50:48.173
How are they gonna
get Amanda up here?

50:49.758 --> 50:51.426
<i>Ambush! Ambush!</i>

50:51.593 --> 50:55.472
<i>Hey, Remy! Fucking Cheese!
Where is she?</i>

50:56.640 --> 51:01.478
<i>There she is.
I can see her. It ain't the way it is!</i>

51:03.063 --> 51:05.148
<i>Someone hit Cheese!</i>

51:05.858 --> 51:07.234
You sure you heard something?
Yes!

51:07.317 --> 51:08.861
- Over there!
- What happened?

51:08.944 --> 51:11.655
I don't know. I heard a splash.
Down there!

51:11.697 --> 51:12.698
Somebody took Cheese out,

51:12.781 --> 51:14.199
- and then all hell broke loose.
- Where's Amanda?

51:14.283 --> 51:15.450
- Shots were fired from over there.
- I don't know!

51:15.534 --> 51:16.535
Something went in the water!

51:16.618 --> 51:17.619
- What?
- You sure you heard something?

51:17.703 --> 51:18.996
- Yeah, something went in, but I...
- Where did it go?

51:19.079 --> 51:20.539
There! Right there!

51:20.622 --> 51:21.665
Oh, my God.

51:22.875 --> 51:24.084
Oh, no.

51:36.221 --> 51:38.140
Jesus Christ!

52:27.022 --> 52:30.275
<i>Paging
Dr. Goldsburn. Dr. Goldsburn to ICU.</i>

52:51.672 --> 52:53.882
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:55.133 --> 52:58.846
- How's the leg?
- It'll be fine.

53:02.015 --> 53:03.809
They find anything?

53:06.103 --> 53:10.941
- They got divers in there now.
- She could still be alive.

53:12.985 --> 53:16.822
Maybe she's hiding.
She could be stuck.

53:16.864 --> 53:18.073
Right?

53:20.617 --> 53:22.619
I don't think so.

53:41.138 --> 53:42.097
Hey...

53:42.181 --> 53:44.266
<i>He's ever seen
in all his years,</i>

53:44.349 --> 53:48.353
<i>on a little girl called Amanda
and a doll named Mirabelle.</i>

53:48.437 --> 53:51.440
<i>This quarry is
extremely deep and treacherous.</i>

53:52.274 --> 53:56.653
<i>All too often,
she keeps that which she takes in.</i>

53:56.695 --> 53:58.447
<i>A sad end
to that story, Suzanne.</i>

53:58.530 --> 53:59.990
<i>It sure is, Phil.</i>

54:00.407 --> 54:03.619
<i>And Ron is next with
sports. The Bruins in action tonight?</i>

54:03.702 --> 54:05.120
<i>Yes, they are, Phil.</i>

54:05.204 --> 54:06.997
<i>The B's took a crack
at the Flyers tonight,</i>

54:07.080 --> 54:09.166
<i>and the rough stuff started
in the first period.</i>

54:09.291 --> 54:12.961
<i>And like that, she was gone.</i>

54:16.173 --> 54:19.218
<i>We gave our statements.
Nick and Remy the same.</i>

54:20.719 --> 54:24.181
<i>All of us spared any blame
for Amanda's death.</i>

54:24.223 --> 54:26.141
<i>Jack Doyle resigned on the condition</i>

54:26.225 --> 54:29.353
<i>that he and he alone
be held accountable.</i>

54:29.436 --> 54:33.106
<i>The legendary captain
of a unit dedicated to children</i>

54:33.190 --> 54:35.859
<i>stepped down today
in the aftermath of controversy.</i>

54:35.901 --> 54:38.987
<i>He was granted
the dignity of early retirement.</i>

54:40.113 --> 54:42.908
<i>But the humiliation of half a pension.</i>

54:45.911 --> 54:49.540
<i>It was an ignominious end
to an illustrious career.</i>

54:50.999 --> 54:54.628
<i>Chris' run lasted a day and a half until,
from what they could tell,</i>

54:54.711 --> 54:57.714
<i>he ran into someone who wanted
the money more than he did.</i>

54:57.756 --> 54:58.757
<i>Twenty-nine-year-old
Chris Mullen</i>

54:58.841 --> 54:59.883
<i>was gunned down last night</i>

54:59.967 --> 55:01.552
<i>in an apparent robbery.</i>

55:01.593 --> 55:03.887
<i>The police commissioner
defended the rising tide of crime</i>

55:03.929 --> 55:06.807
<i>as a statistical aberration tied
to growing unemployment</i>

55:06.890 --> 55:08.892
<i>and the humidity of...</i>

55:13.856 --> 55:16.775
<i>Enough time went by
and they called off the search.</i>

55:16.859 --> 55:19.570
<i>They issued Helene
a death certificate.</i>

55:35.252 --> 55:38.672
<i>The frame and the casket were
donated by the funeral home,</i>

55:40.966 --> 55:44.303
<i>but had to be returned
at the end of the afternoon.</i>

55:47.681 --> 55:49.725
You know I love you, right?

55:49.808 --> 55:51.226
Yeah.

55:52.477 --> 55:55.272
I just wanna be alone for a while.

56:02.446 --> 56:06.491
<i>I don't know if she blamed
me or if she blamed herself.</i>

56:10.245 --> 56:12.998
<i>But when she didn't think I was home,</i>

56:13.081 --> 56:15.584
<i>or if she thought I couldn't hear,</i>

56:16.668 --> 56:18.295
<i>she would cry.</i>

56:25.928 --> 56:30.057
<i>I couldn't stop running it over
and over and over in my mind,</i>

56:31.975 --> 56:33.685
<i>the vague and distant suspicion</i>

56:33.727 --> 56:36.688
<i>that we never understood
what happened that night,</i>

56:36.772 --> 56:38.565
<i>what our role was.</i>

56:41.401 --> 56:43.737
<i>Or maybe it was just that,
like the hundreds of other children</i>

56:43.820 --> 56:46.657
<i>who disappear each year
and never return...</i>

56:48.867 --> 56:53.205
<i>Amanda was even more haunting
for never being found.</i>

56:56.625 --> 57:00.254
<i>What they did find
was another big story,</i>

57:00.337 --> 57:03.632
<i>and I couldn't help but find it strange.</i>

57:03.715 --> 57:09.680
<i>Not two months later and not far away,
another child went missing.</i>

57:09.763 --> 57:11.390
<i>...and community watch patrols
are being formed.</i>

57:11.557 --> 57:15.561
<i>A bicycle left
roadside. A tire left spinning.</i>

57:15.644 --> 57:17.479
<i>Late-breaking news
on that story.</i>

57:17.563 --> 57:19.857
<i>Little Johnny Pietro is also wearing</i>

57:19.898 --> 57:22.025
<i>what this reporter believes
might be a sign.</i>

57:22.401 --> 57:25.028
<i>Johnny Pietro was wearing the
medallion of St. Christopher,</i>

57:25.112 --> 57:26.238
<i>patron saint of...</i>

57:26.321 --> 57:29.366
<i>Johnny Pietro
and his medallion.</i>

57:29.449 --> 57:33.161
<i>What I didn't find strange
was this time,</i>

57:33.245 --> 57:35.581
<i>no relatives came knocking
on our door.</i>

57:38.458 --> 57:40.919
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hi.

57:41.003 --> 57:43.463
- I need you to come on a ride with me.
- Where?

57:44.047 --> 57:45.757
To Everett.

57:45.841 --> 57:48.051
- What, no parties in Lynn?
- Funny.

57:48.093 --> 57:51.346
- You got your toast with you, right?
- My what?

57:51.430 --> 57:53.182
Your gun, dummy.

57:54.141 --> 57:55.267
Yeah.

58:05.611 --> 58:09.072
This ain't no
strip-clubbing in Lynn, Patrick.

58:09.948 --> 58:12.242
I got something better for you, buddy.

58:25.756 --> 58:27.758
You asked me to find
some people for you.

58:27.841 --> 58:29.760
I think I found them.

58:29.801 --> 58:30.886
What you getting me into?

58:30.969 --> 58:33.931
You don't give a fuck about this
Corwin Earle dude no more?

58:34.014 --> 58:37.267
Yo, 'cause the fat bitch
and the old dude are in there.

58:37.351 --> 58:40.312
My man didn't know about the diddler.

58:40.354 --> 58:41.980
Come in with me. Watch my side.

58:42.064 --> 58:45.234
We'll find out
if this motherfucker's in there.

58:46.026 --> 58:47.027
You know what, Patrick?

58:47.110 --> 58:48.737
If you don't wanna come in,
you don't have to come in.

58:48.820 --> 58:51.323
If you don't wanna come in, fuck it.

58:55.160 --> 58:56.662
Let's go.

59:23.188 --> 59:24.690
Guess who?

59:24.773 --> 59:27.651
- Jerome Miller?
- No, it's the coke fairy.

59:27.693 --> 59:29.528
- Open up.
- I got the money right here.

59:29.611 --> 59:32.865
Marmaduke, you think you're gonna
hand me money on a fucking porch?

59:32.948 --> 59:34.700
Open the door.

59:34.783 --> 59:36.201
Who's he?

59:36.243 --> 59:38.996
He's your father.
Open the fucking door!

59:43.166 --> 59:44.251
- Look out.
- Okay, man!

59:44.334 --> 59:46.170
Chill! Chill!

59:55.637 --> 59:57.639
What are you guys, starting a band?

59:57.723 --> 59:59.850
No one's starting a band.

01:00:04.938 --> 01:00:06.565
It's a taste.

01:00:06.648 --> 01:00:08.859
Cocaine for the old man.

01:00:09.735 --> 01:00:11.361
Fucking Christ.

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:15.699
Want me to change
a roll of quarters for you, too?

01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:20.621
I told you to tell me when they got here!

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:22.372
They just got here.

01:00:22.456 --> 01:00:25.375
- You already did some!
- It was a taste bag.

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:26.710
Sorry, love.

01:00:28.754 --> 01:00:31.006
Here, count this fucking mess.

01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:37.346
Where's the rest, man?

01:00:37.429 --> 01:00:41.517
As soon as he's finished counting
that fucking mess you gave me.

01:00:50.275 --> 01:00:53.445
- Mr. Miller, do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.

01:00:54.696 --> 01:00:56.198
- Excuse me!
- You're excused.

01:00:56.281 --> 01:00:59.368
- Hey, please don't snoop around, sir.
- Hey, relax, handsome.

01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:00.619
Excuse me!

01:01:00.702 --> 01:01:03.247
Where the fuck you think you're going?

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:05.582
Mr. Miller, I'm warning you!

01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:08.126
Stop!

01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:15.259
Patrick, shoot this bitch.

01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:21.765
You fat busted cunt.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.769
You put a gun on me, you better use it.

01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:28.397
Just give us the fucking wizza!

01:01:31.984 --> 01:01:34.444
You don't wanna shoot her, Patrick?

01:01:40.242 --> 01:01:41.451
Who's this guy?

01:01:41.493 --> 01:01:44.121
Corwin!
Go back to your room!

01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:46.123
It's not a party?

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:50.252
No, it's not a party.

01:01:52.713 --> 01:01:54.548
How much money's there, Patrick?

01:01:54.631 --> 01:01:56.133
Enough.

01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:00.971
Want this?

01:02:10.355 --> 01:02:13.525
What are you doing?
Pick up the fucking money.

01:02:17.613 --> 01:02:19.948
At least two guns in
the house. Roberta's carrying hers.

01:02:20.032 --> 01:02:22.284
- What else?
- Well, they're definitely high.

01:02:22.326 --> 01:02:24.286
- On what?
- Cocaine.

01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:26.330
Your friend tell you that, too?

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:27.873
SWAT'll be here in five minutes.

01:02:27.956 --> 01:02:29.166
You're not gonna wait for them?

01:02:29.208 --> 01:02:31.335
Did you or did you not tell me
you saw Corwin Earle

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:34.254
with the medallion of St. Christopher
around his fucking wrist?

01:02:34.338 --> 01:02:35.672
I definitely saw Corwin Earle.

01:02:35.714 --> 01:02:37.799
We're not waiting.

01:02:37.883 --> 01:02:40.552
Stay here.
And don't fuck around, all right?

01:02:40.636 --> 01:02:41.929
Good job.

01:03:28.016 --> 01:03:29.393
Fuck.

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.780
An... An officer... Shots are fired!
An officer down... Shots...

01:03:41.864 --> 01:03:42.948
Listen to me!

01:03:43.031 --> 01:03:46.535
A police officer has been shot
at 33 German Road!

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.211
Get away from him!

01:05:33.392 --> 01:05:35.894
It was an accident.

01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:47.573
It was an accident.

01:06:26.278 --> 01:06:27.905
Wait!

01:07:39.351 --> 01:07:40.686
Hey.

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:46.608
You okay?

01:07:48.193 --> 01:07:50.487
They told me what happened.

01:07:55.701 --> 01:07:57.953
I'm proud of you.

01:08:00.539 --> 01:08:02.791
That man killed a child.

01:08:04.251 --> 01:08:06.461
He had no right to live.

01:08:10.048 --> 01:08:12.759
- You're proud of me?
- Of course I am.

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:17.264
You did what you had to do.

01:08:21.059 --> 01:08:23.060
Let's go home.

01:08:28.024 --> 01:08:30.234
I gotta stay here awhile.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.993
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:54.885
Thanks.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.767
It was fucked up, right?

01:09:05.187 --> 01:09:07.481
They tell you anything about Nick?

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:10.149
They said he could be okay.

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:13.319
I don't know.

01:09:15.572 --> 01:09:18.242
They say how old that little boy was?

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:19.868
Seven.

01:09:22.621 --> 01:09:24.163
Second grade.

01:09:25.499 --> 01:09:30.295
Should be proud of yourself.
Most guys would've stayed outside.

01:09:31.964 --> 01:09:33.715
I don't know.

01:09:33.799 --> 01:09:35.759
What don't you know?

01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:40.805
My priest says shame is God
telling you what you did was wrong.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.642
Fuck him.

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.187
Murder's a sin.

01:09:48.145 --> 01:09:50.858
Depends on who you do it to.

01:09:50.941 --> 01:09:54.444
That's not how it works. It is what it is.

01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:10.335
I planted evidence on a guy once,

01:10:12.504 --> 01:10:14.590
back in '95.

01:10:14.673 --> 01:10:17.050
We were paying $ 100
an eight-ball to snitches.

01:10:17.134 --> 01:10:19.845
We got a call
from our pal, Ray Likanski.

01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:22.139
He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.

01:10:22.222 --> 01:10:24.308
Anyway, he tells us there's a guy
pumping up in an apartment

01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:26.518
up in Columbia Point.

01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:29.438
We go in, me and Nicky.

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:33.817
Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,
it was no joke.

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:35.944
So, it's a... It's a stash house, right?

01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:39.907
The old lady's beat to shit,
the husband's mean, cracked out,

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:43.660
tries to give us trouble,
Nicky lays him down.

01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:45.746
We're doing an inventory,
but it looks like we messed up

01:10:45.829 --> 01:10:49.166
because there's no dope in the house,
and I go in the back room...

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:52.753
Now, this place
was a shithole, mind you.

01:10:52.836 --> 01:10:56.465
Rats, roaches all over the place.

01:10:56.548 --> 01:10:59.676
But the kid's room, in the back,

01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:02.679
was spotless.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.684
No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,
it was immaculate.

01:11:09.394 --> 01:11:10.646
The little boy's sitting on the bed

01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:14.149
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:16.777
There's no expression on his face,

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.531
tears streaming down.

01:11:21.865 --> 01:11:25.744
He wants to tell me he just learned
his multiplication tables.

01:11:25.827 --> 01:11:26.995
Christ.

01:11:27.079 --> 01:11:29.665
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:32.417
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:38.131
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

01:11:40.217 --> 01:11:42.594
You're worried what's Catholic?

01:11:42.678 --> 01:11:44.805
I mean, kids forgive.

01:11:45.722 --> 01:11:49.059
Kids don't judge.

01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:51.436
Kids turn the other cheek.

01:11:52.563 --> 01:11:54.398
What do they get for it?

01:11:55.357 --> 01:11:56.692
So I went back out there,

01:11:56.775 --> 01:11:58.861
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

01:11:58.944 --> 01:12:02.281
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

01:12:05.534 --> 01:12:08.495
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:12.958
You gotta take a side.

01:12:14.918 --> 01:12:18.964
You molest a child, you beat a child,

01:12:20.215 --> 01:12:21.717
you're not on my side.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.302
If you see me coming, you better run,

01:12:23.343 --> 01:12:26.263
because I am gonna
lay you the fuck down!

01:12:29.808 --> 01:12:31.351
Easy.

01:12:37.482 --> 01:12:38.817
Don't feel easy.

01:12:39.276 --> 01:12:41.778
Is the kid better off without his father?

01:12:42.613 --> 01:12:43.739
Yeah.

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:47.659
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

01:12:47.743 --> 01:12:50.245
pumping with a gun in his waistband.

01:12:50.996 --> 01:12:52.831
It's a war, man.

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:55.959
Are we winning?

01:12:57.461 --> 01:12:59.046
No.

01:13:04.968 --> 01:13:08.305
Would you do it again?
Clip Corwin Earle?

01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:12.309
No.

01:13:14.728 --> 01:13:16.939
Does that make you right?

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:20.526
Hmm?

01:13:20.609 --> 01:13:22.903
I don't know.

01:13:22.986 --> 01:13:25.447
Doesn't make it wrong, though,
does it?

01:13:42.214 --> 01:13:44.049
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:13:46.385 --> 01:13:47.886
How's Remy?

01:13:49.638 --> 01:13:51.139
He lied to me.

01:13:52.641 --> 01:13:55.352
What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

01:13:55.394 --> 01:13:57.229
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

01:13:57.312 --> 01:14:00.357
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:02.651
He called him his "old pal."

01:14:02.734 --> 01:14:05.571
Said he couldn't find
enough people to snitch out.

01:14:05.654 --> 01:14:06.905
Patrick...

01:14:06.947 --> 01:14:09.950
And Ray Likanski is the reason
Amanda got taken in the first place,

01:14:10.033 --> 01:14:12.202
and Remy lies about knowing him.

01:14:15.247 --> 01:14:16.748
Let it go.

01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:19.376
Why would he lie?
What's he have to hide?

01:14:19.418 --> 01:14:21.461
Amanda's dead.

01:14:21.962 --> 01:14:23.630
Let it go.

01:14:31.638 --> 01:14:33.056
<i>Babe.</i>

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.185
<i>Nick died.</i>

01:14:48.906 --> 01:14:51.783
Left. Left.

01:14:58.290 --> 01:14:59.875
Mr. Kenzie.

01:15:00.584 --> 01:15:03.086
Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.

01:15:16.308 --> 01:15:19.019
Amen.

01:15:54.805 --> 01:15:57.516
- Sorry about Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:03.188
I was thinking about our conversation
the other night.

01:16:03.272 --> 01:16:05.440
Well, I said some things
I shouldn't have.

01:16:05.524 --> 01:16:08.110
You know, too much rum.

01:16:08.193 --> 01:16:09.862
Yeah, like what?

01:16:11.488 --> 01:16:14.366
Don't fuck with me, Patrick. Not today.

01:16:15.367 --> 01:16:17.786
Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.

01:16:18.787 --> 01:16:22.833
Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?
Okay.

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:27.713
Forget about the other night,
and we'll be friends.

01:16:29.423 --> 01:16:31.508
What if I don't?

01:16:31.592 --> 01:16:35.053
That's not an "if"
you wanna bring into your life.

01:16:38.223 --> 01:16:39.600
Had lunch with him last week.

01:16:39.683 --> 01:16:40.851
Dana had lunch with him last week?

01:16:40.893 --> 01:16:42.394
Excuse me.

01:16:44.062 --> 01:16:45.147
Hey, Dev.

01:16:45.647 --> 01:16:49.067
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right, how you been?

01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:51.278
I can't complain.

01:16:51.361 --> 01:16:53.780
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

01:16:54.781 --> 01:16:56.658
Not here.

01:16:56.742 --> 01:17:00.120
If it's like that, then
you're gonna have to buy me lunch.

01:17:00.204 --> 01:17:03.916
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:07.753
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:09.505
DCU, yeah. What's up?

01:17:09.546 --> 01:17:11.089
Why'd he leave?

01:17:11.173 --> 01:17:14.718
Had a habit of just
rubbing people the wrong way.

01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:16.845
Like what? What'd he do?

01:17:16.929 --> 01:17:19.431
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:20.557
Come on.

01:17:20.641 --> 01:17:22.351
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

01:17:22.434 --> 01:17:24.019
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

01:17:26.188 --> 01:17:27.898
So, what happened?

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:30.651
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

01:17:30.734 --> 01:17:31.818
and puts in for a transfer.

01:17:31.902 --> 01:17:32.903
What, to Doyle?

01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:36.698
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana, back in '72.

01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:40.202
You don't think that Remy's
dirty, though, do you?

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:42.120
What's "dirty"?

01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:47.000
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:50.546
Yeah. Why?

01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:53.173
<i>Look, man. CSI is killing us out here.</i>

01:17:53.257 --> 01:17:56.760
Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibers are.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:58.637
Certain people are workers.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.347
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:02.599
So they don't mind it.

01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:08.230
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:12.150
He lied to me.

01:18:12.234 --> 01:18:14.486
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:17.197
that's small enough not to matter.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.829
All right, look.

01:18:23.912 --> 01:18:28.375
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:31.461
Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

01:18:31.545 --> 01:18:32.588
Yeah.

01:18:32.671 --> 01:18:35.632
One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

01:18:35.674 --> 01:18:38.135
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:39.428
So what?

01:18:39.511 --> 01:18:41.263
So my informant tells me,

01:18:41.305 --> 01:18:44.850
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

01:18:45.142 --> 01:18:47.978
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

01:18:48.061 --> 01:18:49.980
How'd he know that?

01:18:51.148 --> 01:18:52.941
Let me tell you something.

01:18:53.025 --> 01:18:54.067
You better think long and hard

01:18:54.151 --> 01:18:57.154
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

01:18:57.196 --> 01:19:02.034
You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:06.538
Thanks for the steak.

01:19:07.206 --> 01:19:08.957
All right.

01:19:22.346 --> 01:19:23.764
Hey.

01:19:25.807 --> 01:19:27.309
I got it.

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:29.895
<i>We need to talk to you, Lionel.</i>

01:19:29.937 --> 01:19:31.355
<i>About what?</i>

01:19:31.438 --> 01:19:34.191
<i>About the acoustics in your apartment.</i>

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:35.817
<i>What?</i>

01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:37.778
<i>Oh, we live
in a three-decker, too, Lionel.</i>

01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:39.696
<i>I got nothing to talk about.</i>

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.866
<i>Well, that's fine.
We can talk to the state police.</i>

01:19:43.992 --> 01:19:46.161
<i>Meet me at Murphy's Law.</i>

01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:06.098
<i>I don't meet him
down Murphy's,</i>

01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:07.474
<i>he's gonna call the staties.</i>

01:20:07.558 --> 01:20:09.935
<i>He's putting a
move on you. Don't go down there.</i>

01:20:10.519 --> 01:20:12.062
<i>I can handle Patrick Kenzie.</i>

01:20:12.145 --> 01:20:13.856
<i>- This is an oath we took.
- I started this.</i>

01:20:13.939 --> 01:20:15.899
<i>- This has to be protected.
- I got things to protect, too.</i>

01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:17.025
<i>- Listen to me!
- All right, Remy.</i>

01:20:17.109 --> 01:20:19.486
<i>You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me.</i>

01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:21.905
<i>- Just trust me, all right?
- No! Trust me!</i>

01:20:21.947 --> 01:20:26.618
<i>Where I come from,
you die with your secrets!</i>

01:20:52.853 --> 01:20:55.314
How long have you known Remy?

01:20:55.355 --> 01:20:58.483
Detective Bressant? Just in...

01:20:58.567 --> 01:21:01.820
Met him through
the investigation of Amanda.

01:21:01.904 --> 01:21:03.864
- That's it?
- Yeah.

01:21:07.284 --> 01:21:09.453
How long you known Remy?

01:21:10.495 --> 01:21:11.663
What is this?

01:21:11.747 --> 01:21:14.708
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:17.127
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:19.671
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

01:21:19.755 --> 01:21:21.381
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:22.466
I'm not.

01:21:22.508 --> 01:21:25.302
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

01:21:25.344 --> 01:21:26.929
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:29.473
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

01:21:29.556 --> 01:21:32.476
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:34.811
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

01:21:34.853 --> 01:21:36.688
And I know you ain't being 100%
with me right now,

01:21:36.772 --> 01:21:38.690
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

01:21:38.774 --> 01:21:41.235
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose...

01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:44.196
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

01:21:45.364 --> 01:21:47.491
I haven't been honest with you.

01:21:47.574 --> 01:21:50.536
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

01:21:50.619 --> 01:21:53.497
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

01:21:53.539 --> 01:21:54.790
The other guy cracked his skull.

01:21:54.873 --> 01:21:57.334
At some point,
I must've said, "I'll kill you."

01:21:57.417 --> 01:22:01.797
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.633
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

01:22:04.675 --> 01:22:07.594
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

01:22:07.678 --> 01:22:09.346
So you knew Detective Bressant.

01:22:09.388 --> 01:22:11.723
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

01:22:11.765 --> 01:22:15.018
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:16.937
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.856
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

01:22:18.939 --> 01:22:20.524
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who... Who...

01:22:20.607 --> 01:22:25.028
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:29.825
Why would I do that?

01:22:29.867 --> 01:22:32.911
I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.

01:22:32.995 --> 01:22:35.998
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:38.041
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:40.294
you're just like everybody else.

01:22:40.377 --> 01:22:42.254
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

01:22:42.337 --> 01:22:43.922
And you thought
you could get away with it.

01:22:44.006 --> 01:22:46.133
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:48.594
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

01:22:48.635 --> 01:22:50.762
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

01:22:50.846 --> 01:22:53.140
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:54.516
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.642
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

01:22:55.726 --> 01:22:57.352
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

01:22:57.436 --> 01:22:58.645
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

01:22:58.729 --> 01:23:00.856
Can I get some service?

01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:02.274
Yeah.

01:23:09.072 --> 01:23:10.449
What?

01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:15.204
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

01:23:15.245 --> 01:23:16.747
Thank you.

01:23:18.081 --> 01:23:20.083
Just give me a second.

01:23:51.365 --> 01:23:54.326
Twenty-three years
is something, right?

01:24:06.922 --> 01:24:08.298
Go.

01:24:12.427 --> 01:24:15.639
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:20.435
<i>I was reading her a story
when Helene and Ray come home.</i>

01:24:20.519 --> 01:24:21.603
<i>They didn't know I was there.</i>

01:24:21.645 --> 01:24:25.190
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

01:24:27.359 --> 01:24:29.945
They started talking about how
they'd robbed this drug dealer.

01:24:30.028 --> 01:24:32.155
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:33.991
What's the monkey gonna do?

01:24:34.032 --> 01:24:35.367
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not...

01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:38.620
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

01:24:38.704 --> 01:24:40.163
So I called Remy and told him.

01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:42.875
There's another drug run
up to Nashua. Taking cocaine...

01:24:42.958 --> 01:24:44.626
And then what?

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.506
We took her.

01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:55.095
<i>Remy laid out this plan.
It seemed easy.</i>

01:24:55.179 --> 01:24:58.015
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

01:24:58.098 --> 01:25:00.142
then we put her back. You know?

01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:02.269
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

01:25:02.352 --> 01:25:03.854
My sister learns a lesson.

01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:06.982
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

01:25:07.065 --> 01:25:10.027
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

01:25:10.068 --> 01:25:11.653
They were gonna handle the cops.

01:25:11.695 --> 01:25:13.947
But Bea, she went nuts.

01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:16.575
<i>Started calling the papers. Hired you.</i>

01:25:16.658 --> 01:25:18.994
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

01:25:19.036 --> 01:25:23.040
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

01:25:23.123 --> 01:25:27.252
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

01:25:27.336 --> 01:25:30.005
<i>They got Chris Mullen
to set up Cheese at the quarry.</i>

01:25:30.047 --> 01:25:33.675
15K and a chance to be the boss.

01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:38.764
<i>Cheese figured out
what was happening.</i>

01:25:38.847 --> 01:25:42.309
<i>Even though it was too late,
he started shooting.</i>

01:25:42.392 --> 01:25:44.311
<i>Panicking.</i>

01:25:46.939 --> 01:25:49.274
<i>And she just fell. I mean, she just...</i>

01:25:49.358 --> 01:25:51.026
She fell in.

01:25:52.486 --> 01:25:54.112
She's gone.

01:25:54.196 --> 01:25:56.365
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

01:25:56.448 --> 01:25:58.659
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

01:26:00.577 --> 01:26:04.206
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:06.875
She was more my kid than Helene's.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.089
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

01:26:12.256 --> 01:26:16.385
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

01:26:16.802 --> 01:26:19.346
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

01:26:19.429 --> 01:26:21.181
smoke a doobie with some guys.

01:26:21.265 --> 01:26:22.975
Two hours.

01:26:24.726 --> 01:26:27.437
Amanda literally roasted.

01:26:28.689 --> 01:26:30.190
She was three.

01:26:32.985 --> 01:26:37.239
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

01:26:38.282 --> 01:26:42.953
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

01:26:45.163 --> 01:26:48.125
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

01:26:49.501 --> 01:26:51.795
Like a fucking pot roast.

01:26:53.922 --> 01:26:56.258
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

01:26:56.341 --> 01:27:00.095
Because she never gave a shit
about anyone but herself.

01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:05.017
Bartender. Open the safe. Now.

01:27:06.685 --> 01:27:10.647
Everybody needs to shut up and stay
calm. On the floor. On the floor!

01:27:10.731 --> 01:27:12.399
- Hands on your head. Do it.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:12.482 --> 01:27:14.067
Everybody stays calm,
this'll be over in a minute.

01:27:14.151 --> 01:27:17.070
Hey, do you know
whose bar this is, shithead?

01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:20.532
Or you can get wise, it's up to you.

01:27:23.243 --> 01:27:25.037
What did you say?

01:27:25.829 --> 01:27:27.831
You're a talker, huh?

01:27:27.915 --> 01:27:29.458
Just keep revving, motherfucker.

01:27:29.541 --> 01:27:31.627
Don't antagonize him.
He's got a gun.

01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:35.047
- Oh, just keep yapping away.
- I didn't say nothing.

01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:37.007
You should learn
to keep your mouth shut.

01:27:37.049 --> 01:27:38.509
Shut the fuck up,
for Christ's sake.

01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:41.303
- Just keep talking, pal.
- I didn't say nothing.

01:27:41.345 --> 01:27:42.721
Close your eyes.

01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:43.931
- Fuck!
- Remy Bressant.

01:27:44.014 --> 01:27:46.350
Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant.

01:27:46.391 --> 01:27:49.144
Oh, fuck, God. Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant!

01:27:49.186 --> 01:27:51.021
- Wait. Wait. Jesus.
- Remy Bressant.

01:27:51.104 --> 01:27:52.648
God damn it. Remy Bressant!

01:27:52.731 --> 01:27:53.815
Amanda McCready was taken

01:27:53.857 --> 01:27:55.025
- by Remy Bressant.
- Jesus. I told him.

01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:57.569
I told him we took her for ransom.
I told him. I told him, Remy.

01:27:57.653 --> 01:28:01.073
Please, I told him we took her
for ransom. I did it.

01:28:01.156 --> 01:28:03.033
Remy, please.

01:28:03.242 --> 01:28:04.743
Please.

01:28:23.011 --> 01:28:24.888
Are you all right?

01:28:26.056 --> 01:28:27.057
Stay with him.

01:29:29.453 --> 01:29:31.205
Drop your gun.

01:29:32.956 --> 01:29:34.625
Put it down!

01:29:39.379 --> 01:29:42.883
That bartender wasn't fucking around.

01:29:52.518 --> 01:29:54.061
What did you do?

01:29:54.937 --> 01:29:56.438
Did you get her killed?

01:29:59.316 --> 01:30:01.026
Say yes.

01:30:05.989 --> 01:30:07.324
Say yes.

01:30:08.242 --> 01:30:09.701
Say yes!

01:30:10.619 --> 01:30:14.790
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:29.137 --> 01:30:31.139
She was a child.

01:30:33.308 --> 01:30:35.185
I love children.

01:31:12.055 --> 01:31:15.642
Why would I expose a conspiracy
that I was a part of?

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:20.564
I mean, did Lionel contradict
anything I've said?

01:31:21.815 --> 01:31:25.068
Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:28.780
A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

01:31:28.864 --> 01:31:31.074
Is corruption looked on lightly?

01:31:31.116 --> 01:31:32.784
Is a little girl getting killed
looked on lightly?

01:31:32.868 --> 01:31:34.077
Whoa, hold on.

01:31:34.161 --> 01:31:36.622
You charge people money
as a detective.

01:31:36.663 --> 01:31:40.626
Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

01:31:40.667 --> 01:31:43.587
And you have no idea
that this is a setup?

01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:46.089
You're baffled. Right?

01:31:47.633 --> 01:31:52.095
No, because, strange as it might seem,

01:31:52.137 --> 01:31:55.390
I believe the police
when they tell me something.

01:31:56.099 --> 01:31:57.309
You're a fresh prick. You know that?

01:31:57.392 --> 01:31:59.603
And because I had a ransom note
and Amanda McCready's blanket

01:31:59.686 --> 01:32:00.771
put in my mailbox.

01:32:00.854 --> 01:32:03.899
And because I read a transcript of
a call that Cheese put into the station.

01:32:03.982 --> 01:32:05.067
A 911 call?

01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:08.195
No, it was a call
Cheese made to the station.

01:32:08.278 --> 01:32:09.571
To Remy Bressant at the station.

01:32:09.655 --> 01:32:11.698
Or that Chris Mullen made,
pretending to be Cheese.

01:32:11.782 --> 01:32:13.575
Or whatever the fuck it was,
but it was recorded,

01:32:13.617 --> 01:32:15.536
and there was a call.

01:32:15.619 --> 01:32:17.538
We don't record calls
coming into the station,

01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:20.415
and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.

01:32:22.501 --> 01:32:25.087
So, did you hear a tape?

01:32:26.463 --> 01:32:28.757
- No, I didn't hear a tape.
- Okay.

01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:31.051
Did you see a transcript?

01:32:35.806 --> 01:32:38.350
No, I must've remembered it wrong.

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:50.070
<i>Kids forgive.</i>

01:32:50.153 --> 01:32:51.655
What do they get for it?

01:32:51.697 --> 01:32:54.157
Amanda literally roasted.

01:33:03.458 --> 01:33:04.626
<i>You think I don't miss her.</i>

01:33:04.710 --> 01:33:07.171
She was more my kid than Helene's.

01:33:07.212 --> 01:33:09.339
I love children.

01:33:13.886 --> 01:33:18.098
This is the kind of thing that if you do,
Patrick, you wanna be sure.

01:33:20.392 --> 01:33:22.102
Are you sure?

01:33:22.811 --> 01:33:24.188
No.

01:33:28.025 --> 01:33:29.902
Are you coming?

01:33:30.527 --> 01:33:31.862
No.

01:33:43.498 --> 01:33:46.210
<i>Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana back in '72.</i>

01:33:46.293 --> 01:33:49.004
<i>Care to read
the highlighted portion?</i>

01:34:00.682 --> 01:34:03.018
Taking a trip?

01:34:03.101 --> 01:34:04.853
Patrick Kenzie.

01:34:06.438 --> 01:34:09.274
To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:34:09.316 --> 01:34:11.944
Remy Bressant died last night.

01:34:12.486 --> 01:34:15.531
I was told. It's a shame.

01:34:16.949 --> 01:34:21.537
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
Because he seemed like a good man.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.455
He was a good man.

01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:27.459
We don't know
why people do what they do.

01:34:27.793 --> 01:34:30.128
Everybody looks out his own window.

01:34:30.379 --> 01:34:32.548
And everyone's got their reasons.

01:34:42.975 --> 01:34:44.643
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:34:44.726 --> 01:34:46.019
- How are you?
- Good.

01:34:46.103 --> 01:34:48.146
<i>Nick! They're firing at me.</i>

01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:49.940
Nick, you hear me? You okay?
They're firing at me!

01:34:49.982 --> 01:34:51.149
Remy!

01:34:51.233 --> 01:34:53.485
- I heard something go in the water!
- Ambush! Ambush!

01:34:53.569 --> 01:34:56.446
- Something went in!
- Run. Remy. Run!

01:34:57.239 --> 01:34:58.532
<i>Panicking.</i>

01:34:58.615 --> 01:35:01.451
<i>Amanda got scared.
She started running.</i>

01:35:01.493 --> 01:35:04.454
<i>She just fell. I mean, she just fell in.</i>

01:35:08.876 --> 01:35:10.043
<i>Twenty-nine-year-old
Chris Mullen</i>

01:35:10.127 --> 01:35:11.545
<i>was gunned down last night</i>

01:35:11.628 --> 01:35:12.880
<i>in an apparent robbery.</i>

01:35:12.963 --> 01:35:16.091
You go back inside with Frannie.
Papa will come in soon.

01:35:16.175 --> 01:35:17.301
Make you a sandwich, okay?

01:35:17.384 --> 01:35:18.635
- All right.
- That's my girl.

01:35:18.677 --> 01:35:19.720
<i>Don't go down there.</i>

01:35:19.803 --> 01:35:21.471
If I think he has the evidence,
I'll take the hit.

01:35:21.555 --> 01:35:22.681
I got no problem doing the time.

01:35:22.764 --> 01:35:25.184
Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.

01:35:25.267 --> 01:35:26.602
<i>All right.
I got things to protect, too.</i>

01:35:26.685 --> 01:35:28.937
<i>You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me</i>

01:35:29.021 --> 01:35:30.189
<i>and you're a danger to Amanda.</i>

01:35:30.272 --> 01:35:32.399
Please, I told him
we took her for ransom. I did it.

01:35:32.482 --> 01:35:34.526
I told him. Remy, please.

01:35:39.656 --> 01:35:40.949
So now you know.

01:35:41.825 --> 01:35:44.286
<i>My sister's not stable.
She's on crack.</i>

01:35:44.369 --> 01:35:46.455
She's talking about leaving the state.
I'm scared for my niece.

01:35:46.538 --> 01:35:48.749
- Who's gonna take care of her?
- We'll do something.

01:35:48.832 --> 01:35:50.959
<i>We'll figure it out.
She's an addict.</i>

01:35:51.043 --> 01:35:52.586
Bigot. Drug mule.

01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:55.714
The child will be dead
or on the street in 10 years.

01:35:55.797 --> 01:35:58.467
<i>What about the uncle?
He can never tell anyone.</i>

01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:01.929
<i>Not even his wife.
Or he'll never see her again.</i>

01:36:02.012 --> 01:36:06.016
<i>It's worth it to him.
Know she'll have a better life.</i>

01:36:06.058 --> 01:36:09.061
<i>Do one last good thing
before we hang it up.</i>

01:36:10.854 --> 01:36:13.899
<i>How many children
have we seen destroyed?</i>

01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:16.193
<i>Enough.</i>

01:36:17.986 --> 01:36:19.780
Does it make you feel better?

01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:24.034
Telling yourself you did it
for the right reasons?

01:36:24.076 --> 01:36:26.411
That you took her to be saved.

01:36:26.495 --> 01:36:28.372
From her own mother?

01:36:30.541 --> 01:36:33.710
We're just trying to give
a little girl a life.

01:36:34.962 --> 01:36:38.298
Wasn't your life to give.
Helene's her mother.

01:36:38.382 --> 01:36:41.093
If you thought she was a bad mother,
you should've gone to Social Services.

01:36:41.176 --> 01:36:45.097
Short of that, she's her mother,
and that's where she belongs.

01:36:46.515 --> 01:36:48.517
You turn around.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.813
You go back to your fucking car,
and you wait 30 years.

01:36:54.273 --> 01:36:56.775
You don't know
what the world is made of yet.

01:36:59.069 --> 01:37:02.155
I'm calling state police in five minutes.
They'll be here in ten.

01:37:02.239 --> 01:37:04.992
Thought you would've
done that by now.

01:37:07.327 --> 01:37:09.580
You know why you haven't?

01:37:11.456 --> 01:37:15.419
Because you think
this might be an irreparable mistake.

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:20.132
Because deep inside you, you know
it doesn't matter what the rules say.

01:37:20.215 --> 01:37:22.259
When the lights go out
and you ask yourself,

01:37:22.342 --> 01:37:26.263
"Is she better off here or better off
there," you know the answer.

01:37:26.305 --> 01:37:28.307
And you always will.

01:37:30.184 --> 01:37:35.272
You... You could do a right thing here.

01:37:35.314 --> 01:37:37.065
A good thing.

01:37:38.233 --> 01:37:40.194
Men live their whole lives
without getting this chance.

01:37:40.277 --> 01:37:42.154
You walk away from it,

01:37:42.237 --> 01:37:44.531
you may not regret it
when you get home.

01:37:44.615 --> 01:37:45.949
You may not regret it for a year,

01:37:46.033 --> 01:37:49.703
but when you get to where I am,
I promise you, you will.

01:37:51.038 --> 01:37:54.958
I'll be dead, you'll be old. But she...

01:37:56.043 --> 01:38:00.214
She'll be dragging around a couple of
tattered, damaged children of her own,

01:38:01.465 --> 01:38:04.843
and you'll be the one
who has to tell them you're sorry.

01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:08.013
You know what? Maybe that'll happen.

01:38:08.096 --> 01:38:12.267
And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,
and I'll live with it.

01:38:14.102 --> 01:38:16.813
But what's never gonna happen
and what I'm not gonna do

01:38:16.855 --> 01:38:18.607
is have to apologize
to a grown woman

01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:19.733
who comes to me and says,

01:38:19.816 --> 01:38:21.902
"I was kidnapped
when I was a little girl,

01:38:21.985 --> 01:38:24.196
"and my aunt hired you to find me.

01:38:24.279 --> 01:38:27.824
"And you did, you found me
with some strange family.

01:38:27.908 --> 01:38:30.702
"But you broke your promise
and you left me there.

01:38:30.786 --> 01:38:33.664
"Why? Why didn't you bring me home?

01:38:34.915 --> 01:38:38.585
"Because all the snacks and the outfits
and the family trips don't matter.

01:38:40.337 --> 01:38:42.881
"They stole me.

01:38:42.965 --> 01:38:46.677
"It wasn't my family
and you knew about it

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.972
"and you knew better
and you did nothing."

01:38:51.723 --> 01:38:53.225
And maybe that grown woman
will forgive me,

01:38:53.308 --> 01:38:55.769
but I'll never forgive myself.

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:04.695
I did what I did for the sake of the child.

01:39:06.321 --> 01:39:09.950
All right. For me, too.

01:39:12.619 --> 01:39:17.916
But now, I'm asking you
for the sake of the child.

01:39:20.586 --> 01:39:22.421
I'm begging you.

01:39:27.593 --> 01:39:29.553
You think about it.

01:39:38.854 --> 01:39:40.564
She's happy.

01:39:42.274 --> 01:39:43.734
What?

01:39:43.775 --> 01:39:46.987
She's happy here. I saw her.

01:39:49.198 --> 01:39:51.116
Angie, don't do this.

01:39:51.158 --> 01:39:54.203
If you call the police,
they will send her back.

01:39:54.286 --> 01:39:57.331
I'm not sending her anywhere.
Helene is her mother.

01:39:58.415 --> 01:39:59.958
She's better off here.

01:40:00.042 --> 01:40:03.879
Why? Because he's got money,
and he makes her sandwiches?

01:40:04.213 --> 01:40:05.964
Because he loves her.

01:40:06.048 --> 01:40:09.426
- Helene loves her, too.
- Helene doesn't treat her that way.

01:40:09.468 --> 01:40:11.428
Well, maybe she'll change.

01:40:11.678 --> 01:40:13.680
She won't change.
People don't change.

01:40:13.764 --> 01:40:15.349
Helene is arsenic.

01:40:15.432 --> 01:40:17.643
Angie, I know that this is hard.

01:40:17.726 --> 01:40:20.062
Look at me, I know it's hard.

01:40:21.146 --> 01:40:24.441
But I need you to stand by me.
I need you to say,

01:40:24.483 --> 01:40:25.609
"We're gonna make the right decision,

01:40:25.692 --> 01:40:26.944
"and we're gonna
make everything okay."

01:40:26.985 --> 01:40:29.112
Everything will be okay.

01:40:29.196 --> 01:40:30.322
Because we're gonna leave her here,

01:40:30.405 --> 01:40:32.574
and every now and then
we're gonna talk about her.

01:40:32.616 --> 01:40:35.786
And where she is,
and about what grade she's in.

01:40:36.411 --> 01:40:39.873
And that'll be okay, because
we're gonna know what school she's in,

01:40:39.957 --> 01:40:42.334
and we're gonna know she's happy,
and she's got birthday parties,

01:40:42.376 --> 01:40:45.337
and she smiles every day,
and she has sleepovers.

01:40:47.673 --> 01:40:49.633
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:40:49.716 --> 01:40:53.345
But you can't ask me
to do something that I can't do.

01:40:56.515 --> 01:40:59.309
And you can't ask me to live with it.

01:41:00.853 --> 01:41:04.815
Patrick, for me. Please?

01:41:08.569 --> 01:41:14.241
I will hate you for doing this,
and I don't want to.

01:42:41.453 --> 01:42:45.249
<i>Once an icon of justice
and a model for crusaders,</i>

01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:48.919
<i>Jack Doyle is behind bars tonight.
Evelyn?</i>

01:42:49.002 --> 01:42:51.129
<i>Social Services, as demanded by law,</i>

01:42:51.213 --> 01:42:55.551
<i>will take time to examine little Amanda
before returning her to home,</i>

01:42:55.634 --> 01:42:57.678
<i>and the arms of a mother
who never gave up hope</i>

01:42:57.761 --> 01:42:59.805
<i>that she would see
her daughter again.</i>

01:43:06.353 --> 01:43:08.105
- Helene, how do you feel...
- Helene, what does it feel like

01:43:08.188 --> 01:43:10.023
- to have your daughter with you now?
- How do you feel?

01:43:10.107 --> 01:43:11.859
Helene, how you feeling
right now? How you feeling...

01:43:11.942 --> 01:43:15.612
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

01:43:15.696 --> 01:43:17.990
Amanda, how do you feel
to see your mom?

01:43:18.073 --> 01:43:19.700
Hey, Amanda.

01:43:20.826 --> 01:43:21.869
Helene, how you feeling?

01:43:21.952 --> 01:43:23.871
- Tell us how it feels.
- Tell us what you're thinking right now.

01:43:23.954 --> 01:43:24.955
You must be so excited.
Give us your feelings.

01:43:25.038 --> 01:43:26.081
Oh, my sweetheart. Oh, my.

01:43:26.164 --> 01:43:28.750
Helene, the whole world wants to know
what you're feeling right now.

01:43:29.251 --> 01:43:31.503
How are you, sweetheart?

01:43:31.587 --> 01:43:33.630
Oh, my heart is brimming.

01:43:33.714 --> 01:43:40.137
And just God bless to everyone
and thank you to all...

01:43:40.179 --> 01:43:43.307
To all the policemen and the firemen,

01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:46.101
I feel like 9/11 right now.

01:43:46.185 --> 01:43:49.313
<i>Oh, I swear to God, I mean, just...</i>

01:43:50.355 --> 01:43:51.773
<i>Do you have any
comments for parents out there</i>

01:43:51.815 --> 01:43:53.233
<i>that might be in a similar situation?</i>

01:43:53.317 --> 01:43:55.944
<i>Oh, just never let
your kids out of your sight.</i>

01:43:55.986 --> 01:43:57.696
<i>Don't trust them to no one.</i>

01:43:57.779 --> 01:44:00.908
<i>And just keep them in your arms,</i>

01:44:00.991 --> 01:44:04.119
<i>as much as they're in your heart,
you keep them in your arms.</i>

01:44:04.203 --> 01:44:06.955
<i>How about that?
A great end to that story.</i>

01:44:06.997 --> 01:44:09.750
<i>- Good news for everybody.
- Yes, it is.</i>

01:44:34.107 --> 01:44:37.778
- Sorry, I had to get some stuff.
- It's all right.

01:44:41.031 --> 01:44:43.450
You wanna talk for a minute?

01:44:46.703 --> 01:44:49.039
There's nothing to say.

01:45:52.352 --> 01:45:55.355
Sorry for being rude, I gotta be
out of here in, like, two minutes.

01:45:55.439 --> 01:45:57.191
Do your thing.

01:46:06.450 --> 01:46:08.702
- Think he'll like me?
- Who?

01:46:08.785 --> 01:46:10.120
My date.

01:46:10.162 --> 01:46:13.165
Oh, how could he not?

01:46:13.207 --> 01:46:15.417
You're sweet.

01:46:15.501 --> 01:46:17.669
<i>He seen me on my American Victim.</i>

01:46:17.753 --> 01:46:20.756
He wrote me letters,
I was like, "Whatever."

01:46:20.797 --> 01:46:24.760
<i>But then he seen my Meredith Vieira,
he drove down here from Providence.</i>

01:46:24.843 --> 01:46:27.846
I'm like, "That's romantic." Right?

01:46:27.888 --> 01:46:29.348
How's your girlfriend?

01:46:29.431 --> 01:46:31.433
She's all right,
she's at the North Shore with her sister.

01:46:31.475 --> 01:46:34.228
Oh, hope she got
better family than I do, right?

01:46:34.311 --> 01:46:36.522
Those dirty motherfuckers.

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.403
She don't get smart, I'll take you out.

01:46:45.614 --> 01:46:48.033
- How's Bea?
- Fuck Bea.

01:46:48.116 --> 01:46:50.244
I banned her from the apartment.

01:46:50.327 --> 01:46:54.331
She sold her unit,
moved out fancy-pants Melrose.

01:46:54.414 --> 01:46:57.501
Don't think she don't hate you
for Lionel going to jail, neither.

01:46:57.584 --> 01:46:59.545
Well, that's probably
why she never paid my bill.

01:46:59.628 --> 01:47:01.922
You should fucking sue.

01:47:02.005 --> 01:47:04.132
How about you, Helene?

01:47:05.217 --> 01:47:06.885
You hate me?

01:47:06.969 --> 01:47:08.679
Fuck no.

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:12.808
Brother or not, he took my kid.
Fuck Lionel. She could have been hurt.

01:47:12.891 --> 01:47:15.894
- What about Amanda?
- What about Amanda?

01:47:18.313 --> 01:47:20.816
- Who's gonna watch her?
- Dottie.

01:47:20.858 --> 01:47:23.443
Yeah, does Dottie know that?

01:47:23.527 --> 01:47:26.238
- She will in five minutes.
- Great.

01:47:26.321 --> 01:47:30.742
Fuck, I'm gonna be late, too.
Unless you don't mind sitting for her.

01:47:34.204 --> 01:47:36.456
- Yeah, sure.
- For real?

01:47:37.541 --> 01:47:40.544
- Yeah, that's fine.
- She likes you.

01:47:44.047 --> 01:47:46.175
Bye, sweetheart.

01:47:46.216 --> 01:47:48.468
You're a godsend, Patrick.

01:47:50.262 --> 01:47:51.763
Bye.

01:48:09.406 --> 01:48:11.658
Is that Mirabelle?

01:48:12.910 --> 01:48:14.828
Annabelle.
