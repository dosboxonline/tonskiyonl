00:01.635 --> 00:06.140
Ethicure. Devoted
to an improved, accessible,

00:06.274 --> 00:09.677
for-profit, state-of-the-art
healthcare experience.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.680
An experience we curate

00:12.813 --> 00:15.149
via our Three Pillars
of the Ethicure mission.

00:16.149 --> 00:19.853
Pillar one, our hospital.

00:19.987 --> 00:23.657
A new color palette
designed to create
a sense of well-being.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.026
Cutting edge technologies.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.029
Faster testing
and imaging results.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.864
And countless new
surgical innovations.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.102
Pillar two, our doctors.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.738
We want you healthy and happy,

00:37.871 --> 00:42.543
so if you look
under the table,
you will find,

00:42.676 --> 00:44.478
custom fitness trackers,

00:45.313 --> 00:48.048
Ethicure scrubs,

00:48.182 --> 00:50.584
along with
a few other goodies.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.654
We'll also be introducing
new well-being incentives

00:53.787 --> 00:56.357
and protocols designed
to encourage teamwork

00:56.490 --> 00:58.426
and mutual respect.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.195
Bosses have first names, too.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.796
(LAUGHS)

01:02.930 --> 01:05.465
Which leads us
to pillar three.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.001
At Ethicure,
we do not treat patients.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.903
We serve clients.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.839
So we will be seeking
their feedback

01:11.972 --> 01:14.508
at every stage
of the Ethicure experience,

01:14.642 --> 01:18.312
because a happy client
is a referring client.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.150
My name is Salen.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.352
Welcome to
the Ethicure family.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.723
DR. PARK:
I really want to break this.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.559
Our jobs no longer depend
on saving lives,

01:31.692 --> 01:33.361
but how many smiley faces
get punched.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.129
It's cute.
FEMALE VOICE: <i>Thank you!</i>

01:35.263 --> 01:38.132
She's just
incentivizing niceness.

01:38.266 --> 01:41.235
You of all people
do not want to be rated
by how nice you are.

01:41.369 --> 01:44.272
I can't fake saving lives,
but being nice?

01:44.405 --> 01:46.274
Way easier to game.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.276
It counts your steps,
your pulse ox,

01:48.409 --> 01:52.280
monitors when you sleep,
warns you
when you're stressed,

01:52.413 --> 01:55.583
and stores
a thousand playlists.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.051
If it vibrated,
I'd marry it.
Jordan.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.888
Ethicure knows
where we are,
what we're listening to,

02:01.021 --> 02:03.090
how we're sleeping,
maybe even
who we're sleeping with.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.626
It also tracks paranoia.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.261
You're fine
with all of this?

02:07.395 --> 02:08.596
I mean,
it's great if you are,

02:08.729 --> 02:11.098
but change is sometimes
tricky for you.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.966
I was concerned,

02:13.100 --> 02:15.736
but Ethicure's changes
seem reasonable
and data-driven.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.571
I think we should start
by picking a cake.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.407
You prioritized the cake,

02:19.540 --> 02:21.242
over the date,
the venue,
the caterer...

02:21.375 --> 02:23.076
I like cake.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.213
I've compiled a list
of the most popular ones.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.714
What is
your favorite cake?

02:26.847 --> 02:28.616
Whatever you think
our guests will like.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.451
There is no such thing
as bad cake.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.753
Whew.
Take a good look.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.555
You won't be
seeing much of me
for a while.

02:34.688 --> 02:38.559
I'll be very busy turning
a good program into a bad one.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.627
Yeah.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.519

is covering the cervix.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.694
You'll need to stay here.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.363
Can't let her
out of my sight, Doctor.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.664

for murdering her first baby.

I completed my residency?

put you on the schedule at all

03:40.153 --> 03:42.690
until you at least knew
where the bathrooms were.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.958
Oh, come on, <i>guapa,</i>
look at all this stuff.

03:45.092 --> 03:48.396

and I'm starving to death.

Please don't call me <i>guapa</i>

03:51.198 --> 03:52.933

03:55.903 --> 03:57.838
What do you think of her?
I'm not a fan

03:57.971 --> 03:59.673
of an algorithm
telling me what to do.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.841
This thing
did a great job

04:00.974 --> 04:03.243
filling up my dance card
for the next week.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.212
She knows what I like.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.781
Good to have you on board.
Glad to be here.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.883
Not all of our dance cards
are full.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.752
Mind if I tag along
on your morning rounds,

04:11.885 --> 04:13.387
maybe show me
where the bathrooms are?

04:13.521 --> 04:14.955

Sure.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.596
DR. PARK:
I looked up her case.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.097
Abby Clemmis was charged

04:24.231 --> 04:26.334
with poisoning her baby
with antifreeze.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.404
She pleaded not guilty
and got pregnant again
before the trial.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.072
But when
she was convicted,

04:32.205 --> 04:34.308
her boyfriend,
like everybody else,
stopped believing her.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.710
DR. REZNICK: Oh, boo-hoo.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.912
Stay focused.
You're now being timed.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.514
All part of the
productivity metric.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.856
Forget the timer.
It takes as long as it takes.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.658

(BEEPING CONTINUES)

04:55.195 --> 04:57.898
(SIGHS)

04:58.031 --> 04:59.733
It was probably
postpartum depression.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.469
Doesn't make the baby
any less dead.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.604
But we might have
a little sympathy.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.139
Because women are helpless
victims of our hormones?

05:06.273 --> 05:08.241
Like people who should be
treated rather than punished.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.810
What's your favorite cake?

05:12.446 --> 05:15.315
Lea and I need to pick a cake
for our wedding.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.750
Angel food cake.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.786
Packing peanuts
have more flavor.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.489
SALEN: Anything with
cream cheese frosting.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.790
I'd eat dog poop

distract you.

it's great to see you again.

And now we have
a new policy.

As soon as they're stable,
you'll discharge them,

from postpartum depression,

08:26.206 --> 08:29.309
a lesion in your lung.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.912
Which may be benign,
but we have to do a biopsy
to know for sure.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.847
If I had a lesion
in my lung,

08:34.982 --> 08:36.515
wouldn't that
be slowing me down?

is healthy

and treatment options.

I barely know you.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.083
Showing up
at my track meets

(CHUCKLING) Okay.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.761
And you don't show everyone
all your goodies.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.029
Your "parents"
didn't teach you respect.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.869
Abby needs
"a few more tests"?

10:02.002 --> 10:04.537
You just don't want
to send her back to prison.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.273
If she'd been getting
decent healthcare,

10:06.406 --> 10:09.209
they would've caught
the placenta previa long ago.

10:09.342 --> 10:13.080
So if I can delay
sending Abby back there,
I will.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.048
We're discharging her

Hypotonia?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.160
She's taking
very little nutrition.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.097
Maybe ultrasound her
for a G.I. tract obstruction?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.432
We could change the formula.
She might just be
a picky eater.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.402
Good point.
I'll try that.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.825
Your absence
at the presentation
this morning

10:57.958 --> 10:59.626
could be interpreted
as a lack of support.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.829
You think?

11:01.962 --> 11:05.665
When we first met,
you were a fake patient,

11:05.799 --> 11:07.200
and now you're
a hostile corporate raider.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.136
This hostile
corporate raider

11:09.269 --> 11:11.271
saved your hospital
from being turned into condos.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.806
I resign.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.342
And I hate
your new logo.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.215
You've got
a very loyal following,

11:22.349 --> 11:24.752
many of whom will be very
opposed to this takeover.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.486
You leaving could have
a snowball effect.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.458
My board of directors...
and I

11:31.591 --> 11:32.993
think it's important
for you to stay on.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.995
So you can
draw on my expertise?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.329
Or because
you want a puppet?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.800
Either way,
you've got decent leverage.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.471
Normally, I'd be offering
stock options,

11:44.604 --> 11:48.041
salary incentives,
definitely a larger office,

11:48.175 --> 11:51.011
but I suspect
none of those will work.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.016
So maybe, despite it
being a money hole,

11:56.149 --> 11:58.819
I'll just keep
your clinic open.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.153
How's that?

Think about it.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.258
Your baby's not
getting enough nutrition.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.528
Her ultrasound was clear.

her mother's milk.

Hey, sweetie.

the mass in your lung
is malignant melanoma,

13:28.541 --> 13:31.578
Your PET scan shows
it's also in the lymph nodes

13:31.711 --> 13:35.015
of your neck, abdomen,
and pelvis.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.288

13:41.421 --> 13:45.425

something in that breast milk

15:38.205 --> 15:39.372
that made the baby sick.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.108
More likely
it was antifreeze.

Right. She smuggled antifreeze

that I know
is a waste of time.

to do it,

I don't need a solution.
I just want to vent.

Okay.

The solution well is dry.

Y-You always tell me
to use my words

25:04.070 --> 25:06.773

but I did that,

25:06.906 --> 25:09.308

only made you
more upset.

and the fact
that we can't stop
the bleeding.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.955
Yeah, she needs
a hysterectomy.

again? Win-win.

How?
I'm gonna ask her.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.139
We met in the server room
a few days ago.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.008
You were pretending
to be a patient,

27:22.141 --> 27:25.812
which I feel was dishonest
and manipulative

27:25.945 --> 27:27.079
You don't like me.
Duly noted.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.981
No, no,
I just think it's important

27:29.115 --> 27:31.784
for people to explain
how they're feeling.

27:31.918 --> 27:34.486
I did judge you, but I have
noticed positive things,

27:34.620 --> 27:37.356
like more efficient
sharing of external EHRs

pointless.

he's her boyfriend.

But, you know, I got to assist
on two appies, a chole,

39:02.273 --> 39:05.377
and a hip replacement,
so...there.

39:06.311 --> 39:07.779
Not a lot of steps.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.716
I just hit 11,000.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.283
Mmm.
That's impressive.

39:12.418 --> 39:13.652
Mmm-hmm.

39:13.785 --> 39:17.956
'Course it's no 22,378.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.958
It doesn't measure steps.

39:20.091 --> 39:20.959
It measures how many times
you move your wrist

39:21.092 --> 39:23.995
in rhythmic motion.

39:24.129 --> 39:27.633
So you log a quarter-mile
anytime you have
some "me time"?

39:27.766 --> 39:29.167
I haven't had any time
for that, either.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.736
Mmm.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.505
I just strapped it
to a dialysis pump.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.373
That's clever.
Mmm.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.576
It's also cheating.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.010
It's only cheating
if the rules have merit.

39:44.315 --> 39:45.817
Vive la revolution.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.994
Regrets are for when
you make a mistake,

39:56.127 --> 39:58.396
not for when you do
the right thing.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.534
I can handle Dr. Andrews.

40:07.172 --> 40:10.876
After we took his case,
made him look bad?

40:11.009 --> 40:14.212
Andrews is gonna "supervise"
the hell out of you.

40:14.345 --> 40:16.615
I'm not worried.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.484
You know why?

40:19.551 --> 40:21.520
Because, <i>guapa,</i>

40:23.321 --> 40:25.857
I get to see you
every day,

40:27.192 --> 40:29.427
and that makes
everything wonderful.

40:46.845 --> 40:47.946
I solved
our cake problem.

40:49.548 --> 40:51.249
We serve them all?

40:51.382 --> 40:53.719
Kinda brilliant, Shaunie.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.722
I am
quite proud of myself.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.624
(CHUCKLES)
I solved my problem, too.

40:58.757 --> 41:01.359
I pitched my program idea
to Salen, and she loved it.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.296
SHAUN: Mmm...

41:05.430 --> 41:07.599
This soap is different.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.168
And I'm proud of you, too.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.338
You've done an amazing job
with all these new changes,

41:13.471 --> 41:15.574
especially those scrubs,
which you look super cute in.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.609
What? No.
They're itchy.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.545
(CHUCKLES)
We'll wash them,

41:19.678 --> 41:21.412
try some unscented
fabric softener.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.882
Okay, this soap
won't come off.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.283
Okay, no rush.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.452
Paper towels?

41:27.586 --> 41:30.321
Oh. I think
they got rid of them
for sanitary reasons.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.092
(DRYER BLOWING LOUDLY)
No! No.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.794
No.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.029
No. S-Stop it.
No. Okay.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.164
Okay, Sha... Oh.
No.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.166
Stop it.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.868
I-I can't, Shaun. Breathe.
Stop it. No, please stop it.

41:43.001 --> 41:43.935
It'll be okay. If you just
step away from it...

41:44.069 --> 41:45.804
No. Please. S-Stop it!
Yeah. It's okay.

41:45.937 --> 41:48.506
Shaun?
Stop it! Stop it!

41:48.640 --> 41:51.743
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
You're gonna be okay.
Shaun.
