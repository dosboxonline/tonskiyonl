00:02.085 --> 00:03.962
You should be getting a raise.

00:04.045 --> 00:06.381
You don't get a raise
every time you do something well.

00:06.464 --> 00:10.552
You did something very well
and saved $1.75 million.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.303
I'll talk to Dr. Glassman about it.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.430
No, you won't.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.807
If any talking
or anything else needs to be done,

00:15.890 --> 00:18.268
I'm fully capable of handling that my…

00:18.351 --> 00:19.602
Hey!

00:19.686 --> 00:21.563
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.232
Hey. Hey. That's my car.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.900
You can pick it up at Tricky's Towing.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.153
I'm picking it up right now
because this is my car.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.739
I'm allowed to park here,
and you're a trespasser.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.449
Any time after 1:00.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.534
Shaun, tell him.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.954
Mm, this is not your spot.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.373
[chuckling] Oops. Someone told a lie.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.544
I just got a spot last week,

00:44.627 --> 00:46.212
so it's kind of new to everyone.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.298
So, yes, it is not my spot,

00:48.381 --> 00:50.592
but that doesn't make it
the wrong spot.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.428
It'll be $250, cash or credit.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.513
I'm not paying $250.
I don't have $250 to waste…

00:55.597 --> 00:56.639
If you get that raise…

00:56.723 --> 00:57.724
-Shaun.
-[chuckles]

00:57.807 --> 00:59.434
Would you just stop for a minute?

00:59.517 --> 01:00.518
Not once I start.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.436
That's not a law.

01:01.519 --> 01:04.272
That's just some bull
you bastards made up so you can do this.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.690
$350.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.776
Hostile work environment fee.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.538
Jeffrey Williams. 21 years old.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.249
When he was five,
he fell in love with baseball,

01:23.333 --> 01:25.001
dreamt of playing with the Tigers.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.586
By the time he was eight,

01:26.669 --> 01:29.255
he was the best hitter
in Little League. Right, Jeff?

01:30.465 --> 01:31.299
At nine,

01:31.382 --> 01:34.010
he led his team
all the way to the Divisionals.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.615
[theme music playing]

02:21.975 --> 02:23.810
<i>Pura vida,</i> Dannie.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.659
[beeping stops]

02:47.208 --> 02:49.252
-Retropulsion.
-What?

02:49.878 --> 02:51.379
Her thumb moved.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.174
What does that mean?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.259
[Dr. Reznick] Nothing.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.052
If it happened, it's a normal response

02:58.136 --> 02:59.220
in dying muscles.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.557
Or it could just be the result of hypoxia
or an electrolyte imbalance.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.935
Or brain activity.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.565
The E.E.G. showed
no purposeful brain activity.

03:10.648 --> 03:11.983
Hook her back up.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.818
Elias, over the last ten years,

03:13.902 --> 03:15.403
Dannie's had thousands of tests.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.654
If there was any chance…

03:16.738 --> 03:18.239
Dr. Reznick, please. Now.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.082
[beeping resumes]

03:34.005 --> 03:35.632
Ankylosing spondylitis.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.091
Nasty little disease.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.469
When Jeff was ten,
the inflammation was so bad

03:39.552 --> 03:43.014
the bones in his back
started to fuse together

03:43.097 --> 03:45.225
into one big, gnarly bone.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.727
If you can't extend your back,
you can't use your legs.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.479
If you can't unwind your back,

03:49.562 --> 03:50.855
you can't use your arms.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.440
Useless legs, useless arms.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.317
Can't even fit into a standard wheelchair.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.195
I've had breakfast in bed
since I was ten.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.696
And lunch.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.656
And dinner.

04:00.782 --> 04:01.950
Are you in a lot of pain?

04:02.575 --> 04:04.160
Not compared to what it was.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.205
I wish I'd met that rheumatologist
at the Baltimore Spine Clinic

04:07.288 --> 04:08.706
seven years earlier.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.041
They didn't offer you surgery?

04:10.124 --> 04:12.043
Well, I've… I've been
to nine neurosurgeons,

04:12.126 --> 04:14.879
and they all said
that they couldn't fix me, so…

04:18.007 --> 04:19.342
But thanks to Dr. Glassman,

04:19.425 --> 04:21.219
my post-pretzel future's looking bright.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.432
I wanna move out of long-term care,

04:27.433 --> 04:28.643
study engineering,

04:29.811 --> 04:30.895
go to Europe,

04:31.562 --> 04:34.065
hell, go to a ballpark and see the game,

04:35.733 --> 04:36.818
maybe with a girl.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.491
I'd just love to be able
to hug someone again.

04:48.913 --> 04:52.375
I'm gonna need
two residents to assist me with…

04:54.294 --> 04:55.336
With the surgery.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.510
[Dr. Reznick]
What were you doing ten years ago?

05:02.593 --> 05:03.720
That's how long it's been

05:03.803 --> 05:05.805
since the aneurysm
in her brain ruptured

05:05.888 --> 05:07.974
and how long Elias has been visiting,

05:08.057 --> 05:09.392
bringing her Peppermint Patties

05:09.475 --> 05:12.145
and hoping for that special day
she opens her eyes and says,

05:12.228 --> 05:13.563
"Hi, honey. Did I sleep in?"

05:13.646 --> 05:15.982
And I had finally gotten him
to give that up.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.066
Give up hope?

05:17.150 --> 05:20.194
Give up an impossible fantasy
that has paralyzed his life.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.323
He used to have a career, goals, a wife,

05:23.406 --> 05:25.950
things he can have again
if we let him move on.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.201
And by "we," I mean you.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.662
So you're gonna tell him
that the twitch meant nothing.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.664
But she has elevated levels of dopamine.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.208
Which is a stress hormone,
likely produced by the adrenal

05:34.292 --> 05:35.918
when it was temporarily shut down.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.255
But it's also a neurotransmitter
in the brain

05:39.338 --> 05:42.884
and may be associated
with increased brain activity.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.261
We need to do a SPECT-CT
of her brain and full body

05:45.344 --> 05:47.972
with radiotracers to find
the source of the dopamine.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.308
You know about Elias, right?

05:50.391 --> 05:53.728
The patient's husband who can't move on
and it's making everything worse?

05:53.811 --> 05:55.229
Do you see an analogy here?

05:55.813 --> 05:56.814
No.

05:56.898 --> 05:57.899
No more tests, Shaun.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.486
I'll ask Dr. Lim.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.947
-I'm calling your bluff.
-I don't know how to bluff.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.750
Joint cuts are nearly perfect.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.587
Nearly perfect leaves him
with no feeling in his legs.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.884
I kind of cracked the vertebral body.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.512
But I got the rest right.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.728
[sighs]

06:38.481 --> 06:39.482
[sighs]

06:40.358 --> 06:41.526
That is perfect.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.735
Welcome to my team.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.699
Textbook.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.202
You followed the video
demonstration exactly.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.170
You didn't.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.590
The third bone is the problem,

07:04.674 --> 07:07.510
and you messed around
with the first one. Why?

07:08.261 --> 07:11.305
My model was a bit more severe
than the one in the demo,

07:11.389 --> 07:15.810
so I thought a three-column reconstruction
might be better.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.148
Nice. Nice improv.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.024
You're on my team.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.824
[instruments clank]

07:39.667 --> 07:41.502
I mapped out every screw placement,

07:41.586 --> 07:43.504
osteotomy cut, rod contouring.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.304
You know, I've been trying to figure out
why you're doing this.

07:51.888 --> 07:55.349
I don't know. Change a kid's life?
Something like that.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.019
I'm thinking you must be afraid.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.771
-What?
-Come on.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.941
You've been impulsive
ever since you recovered from cancer.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.277
You quit surgery to start a clinic,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.613
married my favorite barista
after a few dates,

08:08.696 --> 08:10.740
and I'm guessing none of it
made you happy.

08:10.823 --> 08:11.949
I'm sorry.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.660
We barely talk to each other
outside of the board meetings,

08:14.744 --> 08:17.371
and now, all of a sudden,
you can see into my soul?

08:17.455 --> 08:19.749
I love my wife. I love my work.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.833
Great.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.377
And you still feel empty, don't you?

08:24.253 --> 08:27.006
I'm thinking you're scared
something's missing from your life,

08:27.089 --> 08:28.090
so you keep reaching.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.426
You take on a case
no other surgeon will touch.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.511
[folder thuds]

08:33.179 --> 08:34.931
As fascinating as all this is,

08:35.014 --> 08:38.726
I don't think Jeffrey really cares all
that much why we're doing the surgery.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.810
He should.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.647
Because your motives
are affecting your ability

08:42.730 --> 08:46.442
to properly assess
whether that surgery is worth the risk.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.490
[sighs]

08:55.284 --> 08:56.911
Thank you for the input.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.714
You were supposed to meet me for lunch
at 12:15.

09:08.798 --> 09:09.924
It's 12:23.

09:10.007 --> 09:13.135
I'm not the first person
Tricky has shafted. He's earned his name.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.137
I'm gathering every complaint I can find,

09:15.221 --> 09:17.306
which I wouldn't be doing
if you'd backed me up.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.308
So no lunch.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.312
Mm, are you mad at me?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.565
When you're mad at me,
you don't look at me.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.192
Although, you are now,
so maybe you're not.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.611
I turned to my boyfriend for support,

09:30.695 --> 09:32.113
and he hung me out to dry,

09:32.196 --> 09:33.864
so let's just say I am disappointed.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.700
I told the truth.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.244
This isn't about honesty.
This is about having my back.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.039
We're a team now, Shaun,
working together for a common goal.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.209
And right now, our goal
is to get my car back.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.713
Then you need to pay $350.

09:48.796 --> 09:49.880
I'm paying nothing.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.508
He is a pirate,
and I'm going to expose him to the world.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.479
[Jordan] No increased
dopamine-specific uptake.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.939
It's not coming from the brain.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.400
Which means it must've come
from the adrenal glands

10:09.483 --> 10:11.110
when we shut down
their oxygen supply.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.570
Move down to adrenals.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.113
[keyboard clacking]

10:14.196 --> 10:15.323
Impressive…

10:15.406 --> 10:17.283
To mourn his wife for ten years.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.743
He's not mourning her.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.328
He can't as long as she's alive.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.456
Dannie is stuck in limbo,

10:23.539 --> 10:25.333
somewhere between life and death.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.334
So is he.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.795
If there are time limits
to being a good partner,

10:29.879 --> 10:32.131
are there also ethical limits?

10:33.591 --> 10:36.761
Should you support them
even if they've done something wrong?

10:36.844 --> 10:39.430
You think maybe
the coma patient robbed a bank?

10:39.513 --> 10:41.682
-Good alibi.
-What did Lea do?

10:41.766 --> 10:43.976
Doesn't matter. Support her.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.853
Whether you agree with them or not,

10:45.936 --> 10:48.147
the job of a good partner
is to be supportive.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.193
As opposed to, say, resolving disputes

10:52.276 --> 10:53.903
by running to the Chief of Surgery.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.363
[monitor beeps]

10:55.446 --> 10:57.865
It's not coming from the adrenals either.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.286
[monitor beeps]

11:02.662 --> 11:05.790
There it is,
but it's not coming from an organ.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.083
It's coming from a tumor.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.630
Dannie has cancer.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.346
You could say we're doing
a kind of Humpty Dumpty,

11:20.429 --> 11:21.430
only this time,

11:21.514 --> 11:24.600
we're actually
going to put you back together again.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.060
Don't get too excited, though.

11:26.143 --> 11:29.146
Dr. Andrews wants to give us
a little reality check.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.523
If all goes well,

11:30.606 --> 11:32.733
you'll have a restricted range of motion

11:32.817 --> 11:33.984
and be dependent on a walker.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.531
If all doesn't go well,
there is a risk of paralysis

11:38.614 --> 11:40.783
and, given the potential
for massive blood loss,

11:40.866 --> 11:45.037
there's a small chance
you might not survive the surgery.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.332
But you have a great team

11:48.416 --> 11:50.960
and one of the top neurosurgeons
in the world.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.380
So, what do you say?

11:55.297 --> 11:56.549
This is really happening.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.135
Yes, sir. Tomorrow morning. First thing.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.312
I'm sorry, Dr. Glassman.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.815
I can't… I can't do it.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.162
She has a paraganglioma
abutting her vertebrae.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.039
Her twitch wasn't a sign
of increased brain activity.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.750
It was just a reaction
to the tumor irritating her nerves.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.424
We can take her off life support.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.634
What about this cancer?
Is it treatable?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.553
The only treatment would be surgery,

12:42.636 --> 12:44.054
and it's in a difficult location.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.056
Well, what happens
if you don't remove it?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.433
[Shaun] It's malignant.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.268
Dannie would die
within a couple of months.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.769
Then you have to operate.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.146
She could die in the OR.

12:52.229 --> 12:55.065
rather than here
with you holding her hand.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.860
We rechecked her E.E.G.
There's no change.

12:57.943 --> 12:58.944
There was a change.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.947
Uh, the thumb movement
was a change.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.033
And the cancer
and the dopamine were changes.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.451
Something else could change,

13:05.534 --> 13:07.995
and maybe that's the change
that'll wake her up.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.623
Elias, her body is dying.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.124
Only if we let it.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.880
I gave up on her once.
I'm not doing that again.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.312
I've got your discharge paperwork.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.942
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

13:38.025 --> 13:38.984
Mm.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.444
I thought I was ready for this,

13:40.528 --> 13:42.446
and I knew it was dangerous.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.617
Hey, look, my life isn't perfect,

13:47.952 --> 13:50.788
but it's not so bad
that I want to risk throwing it all away.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.133
You ever hear of Gates Brown?

14:04.843 --> 14:06.762
Left field for the '68 Tigers?

14:06.845 --> 14:07.805
Yes.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.974
My dad had his baseball card.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.184
Your dad ever tell you about his story?

14:13.561 --> 14:16.605
First person to recognize his talent
was a prison guard.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.109
He helped him get out of prison
a year early on parole

14:20.192 --> 14:22.111
so he could play professional baseball.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.117
I think about Gates Brown a lot.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.787
Whenever I have to make a…

14:31.871 --> 14:35.583
A tough, really tough decision,

14:35.666 --> 14:38.043
I think about how scared he must've been.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.296
What, playing for the Tigers?

14:40.379 --> 14:42.298
It's a dream come true.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.382
Real scary.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.509
Getting out of jail early,

14:45.593 --> 14:48.762
facing a world
he hadn't been in in a while.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.432
What if he didn't live up to expectations?

14:51.515 --> 14:53.350
What if he wasn't good enough
for the bigs?

14:53.434 --> 14:56.020
But he kept fighting. He kept pushing.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.065
You wanted to have this surgery,

15:00.149 --> 15:02.318
and you kept fighting
and you kept pushing

15:02.401 --> 15:04.445
and doctor after doctor said no,

15:04.528 --> 15:07.448
then finally you found
a doctor who said yes,

15:07.531 --> 15:09.450
and now you stop?

15:09.533 --> 15:10.868
That doesn't make any sense.

15:10.951 --> 15:11.869
[sighs]

15:11.952 --> 15:13.621
I don't think that you are afraid

15:13.704 --> 15:15.164
that this surgery is gonna fail.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.166
I think you're afraid it's gonna succeed.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.462
For the last several years,
you could've taken classes online,

15:21.545 --> 15:22.630
worked toward your degree.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.299
-You could've gone traveling.
-You don't think I've tried?

15:25.382 --> 15:27.384
Oh, you tried, okay, and you failed,

15:27.468 --> 15:29.345
but, man, did you have a good excuse.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.389
And now you have the surgery

15:32.473 --> 15:35.559
and it's successful, but you still fail?

15:35.643 --> 15:36.769
That's scary.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.689
Because now you got to look
at yourself in the mirror

15:40.773 --> 15:42.191
and you have to ask,

15:43.275 --> 15:45.402
"Was it my condition, or was it me?"

15:49.782 --> 15:52.201
You know where I celebrated
my tenth birthday?

15:54.244 --> 15:55.329
Children's Hospital,

15:56.914 --> 16:00.334
getting 13 steroid shots into my spine.

16:02.795 --> 16:07.132
By the time I was 11, my entire
social network was RNs and MDs.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.385
I've never had a job.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.807
I've never danced with a girl.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.980
I've never even had a best friend.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.320
I have no idea how to live
like a regular person.

16:31.949 --> 16:32.950
So what?

16:34.785 --> 16:37.663
So you'll suck at it. Join the club.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.831
[scoffs]

16:44.128 --> 16:46.964
Say no to the surgery
if that's the right decision.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.173
But do yourself a favor.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.093
Don't say no
because you're afraid to live your life.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.486
I'm going to support you.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.905
Thank you.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.949
I'm looking right at ya. See?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.242
I noticed.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.494
Let me have your phone.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.915
W-Why?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.960
I've created a couple hundred
Yelp accounts to trash Tricky

17:25.044 --> 17:28.088
and maxed out on my IP address,
so I need another one.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.133
You're not allowed to do that.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.218
He's not allowed to extort people,

17:33.302 --> 17:34.803
so I'm just extorting him back.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.430
Hmm.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.809
Once I threaten to unleash my arsenal,
he'll hand over my car.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.728
He might even detail it for me.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.938
I won't have to actually post anything.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.823
Thank you.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.825
Hmm.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.410
[monitor beeping]

17:58.494 --> 17:59.953
[Dr. Lim] This last segment of tumor

18:00.037 --> 18:02.372
is holding on to her spinal dura
for dear life.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.874
Fine dissecting scissors.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.463
I may be participating in fraud.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.052
But I want to support my partner.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.430
If your partner wants you
to do something

18:18.514 --> 18:20.766
that makes you feel uncomfortable,
shut it down.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.017
Do not enable crazy.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.852
Lea isn't crazy.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.271
We're all crazy sometimes.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.940
Just takes the right motivation.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.694
There is an obvious middle ground.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.988
If you think your partner's
doing something wrong,

18:35.072 --> 18:36.156
help them see what's right.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.576
[alarm buzzing]

18:39.660 --> 18:41.954
Damn it. The capsule ruptured,
and it tore the dura.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.122
We have a CSF leak.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.373
We should try a graft.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.583
Harvest some fascia to reinforce the dura.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.005
Dr. Lim?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.178
[buzzing continues]

19:13.569 --> 19:14.987
[monitor beeping]

19:18.198 --> 19:19.032
Mm.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.912
[hoarsely] Tastes like my birthday.

19:25.622 --> 19:28.333
Lab confirms the tumor wasn't metastatic.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.835
You're cancer-free.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.463
And brain function is apparently fine.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.048
[sighs]

19:36.383 --> 19:38.802
[chuckling] All in all,
it's been a pretty good day.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.265
Ten years.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.605
I miss anything good?

19:52.900 --> 19:53.901
No.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.158
So why'd I wake up?

20:02.784 --> 20:03.994
We're running tests.

20:04.620 --> 20:08.290
There have been cases
of anesthesia rebooting the dormant brain.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.209
Yours was light, but it still might have…

20:10.292 --> 20:11.752
Let's just call it a miracle.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.926
[instrument tapping]

20:20.677 --> 20:22.221
Okay, last bone wedge.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.431
All right, let's start
straightening him out.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.768
[table whirring]

20:36.151 --> 20:37.236
[whirring stops]

20:41.156 --> 20:43.992
You know, if you can talk this kid
into risking his life,

20:44.076 --> 20:46.703
I'm thinking maybe you can
talk anyone out of any fear.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.248
I've been trying to talk you
out of those caps for years.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.125
These caps save lives. No fear in that.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.461
[laughter]

20:58.173 --> 21:00.425
[Enrique] I'm afraid
to eat a cheeseburger.

21:03.553 --> 21:06.556
My mother, she was
very proud of her cooking.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.477
She told us we didn't need
to sacrifice taste to keep kosher.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.562
At least not with her in the kitchen.

21:13.188 --> 21:17.776
And it's crazy considering all
the other ways I've rejected her faith,

21:19.695 --> 21:21.196
but if I do eat one,

21:21.905 --> 21:25.325
it feels like I'm cutting
my last lifeline to my mother.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.166
My mom taught me how to play a guitar.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.837
We had our problems, a lot of them,

21:37.587 --> 21:40.340
but everything seemed to be okay
when we were singing.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.511
Since she died, um,

21:44.594 --> 21:46.763
I'm afraid to even open the case.

21:52.644 --> 21:53.729
[sighs]

21:53.812 --> 21:54.896
[door opens]

21:55.897 --> 21:56.732
[door closes]

21:56.815 --> 21:58.942
It's the middle of your shift.
You miss me?

21:59.443 --> 22:00.986
I had a bad morning.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.112
My patient lived.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.072
That is surprising.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.408
You keep being competent,
you'll get used to it.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.035
I need an ice-cream infusion.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.745
The cafeteria has ice cream.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.954
Not Cherry Garcia.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.749
Heard you lost out to a Firsty.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.042
One bright spot in my day.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.209
[scoffs]

22:18.045 --> 22:20.881
I did everything perfectly,
but it's still not symmetrical.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.508
Hmm.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.177
Nose job.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.514
It's changing as you fix it.
You got to change with it.

22:29.598 --> 22:33.143
Andrews always said the first thing you do
with your plan is to toss it out.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.562
That's exactly why I didn't do
a plastics elective.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.147
Or you're a blue-collar ex-cop

22:37.230 --> 22:39.149
who's afraid to color outside the lines.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.029
Your L3 vertebrae is perfect,

22:44.112 --> 22:46.198
which means you're not
entirely without talent.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.700
But look at the bones
you're not supposed to fix.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.912
What are your instincts telling you
that this procedure manual isn't?

22:55.415 --> 22:56.625
[sighs]

23:04.508 --> 23:05.592
[tool snips]

23:10.764 --> 23:11.765
[chuckles]

23:11.848 --> 23:13.183
Congratulations.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.643
You're now as good as a Firsty.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.104
I almost feel bad
about eating your ice cream.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.731
[cell phone chimes]

23:23.318 --> 23:24.611
[alarm buzzing]

23:25.737 --> 23:27.572
BP's 82/50. Spinal shock?

23:27.656 --> 23:29.908
[Enrique] SSEP and MEP waves are normal.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.576
Check for buckling.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.495
[buzzing continues]

23:35.288 --> 23:36.373
No cord compression.

23:36.456 --> 23:37.958
Pressure's still dropping.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.210
Did we poke a hole in the canal?

23:42.129 --> 23:43.463
Let's back out these screws.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.965
[monitor beeping]

23:45.882 --> 23:47.884
Spine's not the problem. It's his heart.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.970
It's in failure. Crash cart!

23:50.595 --> 23:51.596
[Claire] Scalpel.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.521
I know why Dannie woke up.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.233
The paraganglioma
was filled with dopamine.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.777
And leaking it in trace amounts.
That's how we found it.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.279
But when the capsule ruptured,

24:07.362 --> 24:09.823
the tumor released the dopamine
in very large amounts.

24:09.906 --> 24:13.034
Her spinal tap
showed over 1,200 nanograms per liter.

24:16.079 --> 24:18.999
Which bathed her brain in dopamine,

24:19.082 --> 24:20.709
which energized it and woke her up.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.211
It was just a freak event.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.050
A temporary freak event.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.888
The dopamine's gonna wear off,
and her brain will shut down again.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.265
Yes. And the dose she'd need

24:35.348 --> 24:37.225
to stay awake would be toxic.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.394
If we don't replicate the surge,

24:39.477 --> 24:41.062
she'll relapse into a coma.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.023
And if we do, she'll die.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.528
[sighs]

24:52.324 --> 24:54.826
[Dr. Reznick] Your dopamine levels
are dropping quickly,

24:54.910 --> 24:56.286
and when they return to normal,

24:57.037 --> 24:59.164
you'll return to your comatose state.

25:01.374 --> 25:02.459
-What?
-No.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.586
Sh… Look at her. She's lucid.

25:05.503 --> 25:07.339
She's talking and laughing. She's fine.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.300
I'm sorry.

25:10.717 --> 25:14.095
Th-That's it? There's no treatment,
no surgery, no medication?

25:14.179 --> 25:16.181
-Elias, I wish we…
-No!

25:19.267 --> 25:20.268
[sighs]

25:20.852 --> 25:23.480
H-How long do I have?

25:25.440 --> 25:27.192
Less than 24 hours.

25:29.778 --> 25:30.862
Oh.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.739
[Elias] But she could
wake up again, right?

25:32.822 --> 25:34.366
You didn't think she would this time.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.909
You said she shouldn't have.

25:35.992 --> 25:38.912
The series of events
that coincided to make this happen

25:38.995 --> 25:40.121
was so unlikely,

25:40.205 --> 25:42.749
it is safe to say
it will never happen again.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.709
I want to see another doctor.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.503
-Elias.
-There… There must be some way…

to his contortions.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.432
And now, moving to this new position

26:40.515 --> 26:42.058

26:42.142 --> 26:43.768
His spine and breastbone

Sometimes it's so bad that the breastbone
presses against the heart,

and you got to break away the sternum,
