00:21.284 --> 00:24.207
[Casualties have been medevacked.]

00:24.210 --> 00:28.222
[Live from Shibuya.]

00:28.289 --> 00:32.093
[I can see many cars ablaze
at Shibuya Crossing.]

00:32.100 --> 00:34.396
[The destruction is like a war zone.]

00:34.530 --> 00:40.062
[The area is closed off.
The cause remains unknown.]

02:17.500 --> 02:18.501
Kurono!

02:20.937 --> 02:22.038
Your suit!

02:36.486 --> 02:37.353
Don't.

02:38.087 --> 02:39.455
Someone has to.

02:39.522 --> 02:40.890
But you can't!

02:43.159 --> 02:44.193
I have to!

02:45.027 --> 02:46.329
Who else will?

02:51.267 --> 02:52.435
Kurono!

03:24.167 --> 03:25.168
Kurono.

03:27.303 --> 03:28.604
How's Pop?

03:35.044 --> 03:36.045
He's alive!

03:38.614 --> 03:41.050
Good...

03:48.057 --> 03:51.060
Kurono? Please...

03:51.394 --> 03:54.597
Kurono! Kurono!

03:59.368 --> 04:01.671
No! I don't want to go!

04:01.737 --> 04:03.539
Kurono!

04:33.769 --> 04:36.372
See my shiny and wavy hair.

04:37.773 --> 04:39.542
Enrich your hair.

04:40.409 --> 04:43.112
NEWSFLASH
OSAKA IS IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY

04:43.179 --> 04:45.248
What's going on in Osaka?

04:45.615 --> 04:49.051
Maybe it's monsters, like in Shibuya?

04:51.320 --> 04:54.156
-OSAKA'S IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY.
-YOU OKAY?

04:54.223 --> 04:56.425
LIKE THE KILLINGS IN TOKYO.

04:58.327 --> 05:01.697
It contains super rich
hyaluronic acid, Akatsuki.

05:01.764 --> 05:03.633
-IS IT THE U.S. MILITARY?
-IT'S MASSACRE!

05:15.311 --> 05:18.481
Ayumu, I'm in Shinjuku.
I'll catch a train.

05:19.715 --> 05:23.152
You're late. What have you been doing?

05:23.486 --> 05:24.654
I'm sorry.

05:25.755 --> 05:29.225
Do you remember what today is?

05:33.296 --> 05:34.263
What is it?

05:46.442 --> 05:47.777
He has a knife!

05:50.313 --> 05:51.213
Police!

05:56.152 --> 05:57.086
There!

06:05.161 --> 06:06.495
Where are you hurt?

06:08.097 --> 06:09.365
You'll be okay.

06:37.226 --> 06:38.894
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AYUMU

07:01.550 --> 07:03.919
Am I alive?

07:15.698 --> 07:16.732
Hey, you--

07:19.568 --> 07:21.804
Are you in shock?

07:24.540 --> 07:25.474
I got...

07:26.676 --> 07:27.610
stabbed.

07:28.844 --> 07:29.745
You were?

07:34.517 --> 07:37.319
I dropped dead from a stroke.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.424
Reika here was in a car accident.

07:44.894 --> 07:45.795
Reika...

07:46.862 --> 07:47.830
The star?

07:48.330 --> 07:51.400
Oh, yeah. She's a big deal, right?

07:51.801 --> 07:55.271
I'm a bit out of touch,

07:55.638 --> 07:58.307
but I saw her in a TV ad.

07:58.741 --> 08:00.810
What was it? Shampoo...

08:00.876 --> 08:02.978
Oh, please. Who cares?

08:05.581 --> 08:08.751
Aren't you her fan, Nishi?

08:09.385 --> 08:10.820
I know you schoolboys...

08:10.886 --> 08:12.388
Shut up, Baldy.

08:17.326 --> 08:19.428
What's your name?

08:22.998 --> 08:24.800
Masaru Kato.

08:25.935 --> 08:28.771
My name is Suzuki.

08:29.405 --> 08:31.273
Nice to meet you.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.008
What's going on?

08:33.842 --> 08:35.311
Explain!

08:38.246 --> 08:39.948
It's hard to believe,

08:40.649 --> 08:44.487
but we all died before.

08:44.987 --> 08:46.255
What...?

08:46.322 --> 08:48.357
You told me the same thing.

08:48.791 --> 08:51.293
It makes no sense to me!

08:51.961 --> 08:55.965
Rise and shine
It's a new morning for us

08:56.031 --> 08:59.935
A morning of new hope

09:00.336 --> 09:04.306
Breathe in
A chest full of joy

09:04.373 --> 09:08.277
Look up at the clear, blue sky!

09:08.344 --> 09:10.713
Listen to the radio

09:10.779 --> 09:12.281
What's this?

09:12.548 --> 09:16.519
The summer breeze
It is so wholesome

09:16.585 --> 09:20.656
Breathe in and exercise now

09:20.723 --> 09:23.959
To the count of one, two and three

09:26.929 --> 09:30.366
Your old lives have ended.

09:34.069 --> 09:39.675
I will decide how to use your new lives.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

09:41.744 --> 09:45.848
Go now and finish off this guy.

09:46.415 --> 09:48.417
Nurarihyon.

09:51.620 --> 09:54.089
HE KICKS ASS. HE WON'T GIVE UP.
KILL HIM IN GIVEN TIME.

09:54.356 --> 09:57.660
Oh, no. He looks tough!

09:58.460 --> 10:00.429
What is this thing?

10:01.664 --> 10:04.633
This black orb is... Gantz.

10:05.834 --> 10:06.769
Gantz?

10:07.469 --> 10:11.540
I don't know why,
but that's what everyone calls it.

10:16.378 --> 10:17.613
What the hell?

10:18.747 --> 10:20.749
Are these toy guns?

10:22.084 --> 10:25.054
"Kato-cha, LOL." Is this mine?

10:26.722 --> 10:31.794
You two first-timers
had better get dressed now.

10:31.860 --> 10:35.931
Don't tell me what to do, Baldy!

10:45.074 --> 10:48.477
Morons like him always die first.

10:49.545 --> 10:52.514
What's that, punk?

10:52.781 --> 10:55.084
You're just a stupid gamer.

10:56.385 --> 10:59.488
You have an attitude, school kid.

11:02.524 --> 11:05.160
I'm talking to you, punk!

11:06.061 --> 11:07.696
-Nishi!
-Don't!

11:22.544 --> 11:23.712
I told you.

11:23.779 --> 11:24.713
Nishi!

11:25.080 --> 11:27.683
He would have only dragged us down.

11:33.756 --> 11:35.824
This guy looks useless, too.

11:36.058 --> 11:37.026
Are you okay?

11:37.693 --> 11:39.795
Put on the gear, Kato!

11:40.763 --> 11:41.930
Who are you?

11:43.832 --> 11:48.203
We're stuck playing
an endless survival game.

11:48.938 --> 11:50.639
A survival game?

11:50.706 --> 11:54.076
You must have seen it on the news.

11:54.610 --> 11:57.546
You know the monster in Shibuya...?

11:57.980 --> 12:00.082
We fight the monsters.

12:00.649 --> 12:05.487
You mean,
you're the ones in the black suits?

12:06.822 --> 12:08.190
In the previous game,

12:08.891 --> 12:13.762
our toughest members
were eliminated unfortunately.

12:14.964 --> 12:16.632
We lost our leader.

12:18.967 --> 12:21.637
Gantz, beam me out of here.

12:25.908 --> 12:27.509
Hurry up, Kato!

12:34.717 --> 12:36.852
Quickly, please!

12:43.625 --> 12:45.594
Put it on!

13:35.677 --> 13:36.945
Are you okay?

13:42.818 --> 13:44.887
Wait a minute...

13:45.788 --> 13:46.855
DOTONBORI

13:46.922 --> 13:47.823
We're...

13:49.625 --> 13:50.826
This is Osaka!

13:52.094 --> 13:55.731
But we're always sent to Tokyo!

14:36.271 --> 14:39.174
She's out of range, moron.

15:02.364 --> 15:03.899
Are you okay?

15:05.267 --> 15:07.302
You guys are useless.

15:09.238 --> 15:12.274
Sorry, I totally panicked.

15:12.341 --> 15:14.309
What's going on?

15:15.143 --> 15:17.079
Explain it to me.

15:17.146 --> 15:18.413
Fuck off.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.216
What's going on? What is she?

15:21.850 --> 15:23.919
-Why us?
-Wait, Nishi!

15:24.319 --> 15:26.154
I'll tell him.

15:34.863 --> 15:37.132
Why do we have to fight them?

15:37.799 --> 15:39.368
And who are they?

15:40.068 --> 15:41.904
We don't know.

15:43.338 --> 15:44.673
We only know one thing.

15:44.973 --> 15:49.878
We have to kill all the enemies
before our time runs out.

15:51.213 --> 15:53.182
What if we don't?

15:55.284 --> 15:56.151
Then...

16:00.122 --> 16:02.257
We'd all die.

16:02.324 --> 16:03.458
But...

16:04.893 --> 16:06.128
For real.

16:07.863 --> 16:10.832
We'd no longer exist in the world.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.136
That's the Gantz rules.

16:15.037 --> 16:17.306
What do you mean, rules?

16:20.809 --> 16:21.710
Oh, no!

16:22.878 --> 16:24.279
Impossible!

16:45.167 --> 16:46.201
Come here.

17:22.069 --> 17:23.137
This way.

18:09.384 --> 18:11.386
Kato, go ahead and shoot!

18:22.964 --> 18:24.099
Kato!

18:38.547 --> 18:39.514
I'm okay?

18:40.515 --> 18:42.985
The suit protected you. Come on!

18:53.161 --> 18:54.396
Who did it?

18:56.898 --> 18:59.468
-He's lying!
-Are you?

19:18.453 --> 19:20.122
Who are they?

19:20.655 --> 19:24.092
You have a Tokyo accent.

19:24.593 --> 19:27.362
Are you the Osaka team?

19:27.429 --> 19:28.964
Osaka team?

19:29.464 --> 19:31.199
So, there are more?

19:31.967 --> 19:34.402
How come you don't know that?

19:35.103 --> 19:37.606
This is his first game.

19:40.342 --> 19:44.279
A novice, a kid, a middle-aged man,
and a woman.

19:44.346 --> 19:46.281
How pathetic.

19:52.687 --> 19:53.955
Ouch!

19:54.022 --> 19:56.158
Is he okay?

19:56.658 --> 20:00.629
As long as you're still alive,
you'll get back all your limbs

20:01.129 --> 20:04.232
when the stage is cleared.

20:04.666 --> 20:05.967
What...?

20:06.034 --> 20:10.338
How about that tough guy
who's called Kuro or something?

20:10.405 --> 20:11.706
He's dead.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.544
Wait a minute!

20:16.545 --> 20:17.579
It's Reika!

20:17.646 --> 20:20.682
Man! Look at the jugs on her!

20:20.949 --> 20:21.650
Shit!

20:26.188 --> 20:28.390
Hey, the Tokyo team's not bad.

20:31.293 --> 20:32.594
More of them!

20:32.661 --> 20:34.329
Here we go!

20:43.138 --> 20:45.574
You just sit and watch, wimps.

20:52.247 --> 20:56.051
Reika, watch us finish them off.

20:56.318 --> 20:58.520
Then we can swap numbers.

20:58.753 --> 21:01.389
Come on, George!

21:05.026 --> 21:07.362
There are so many of them!

21:07.662 --> 21:10.131
I'll go for the right side.

21:10.365 --> 21:12.133
How about you?

22:16.531 --> 22:19.100
They're enjoying this...

22:29.544 --> 22:33.181
That's worth points. I'll have it.

23:02.811 --> 23:05.647
How about that, Reika?

23:10.585 --> 23:13.355
The Osaka team is tough.

23:13.755 --> 23:17.192
What's that weapon and the bike thing?

23:19.861 --> 23:24.766
You can get superior weapons
if you score 100 points.

23:25.300 --> 23:26.501
One hundred points...?

23:27.402 --> 23:29.271
After defeating the enemies,

23:29.738 --> 23:33.775
we're teleported back to the room
to get scored.

23:34.576 --> 23:36.478
100-POINT MENU

23:36.544 --> 23:39.180
If you get 100, you win the game.

23:42.617 --> 23:46.721
Gantz gives you three bonus options.

23:46.788 --> 23:48.256
Like what?

23:49.891 --> 23:51.926
Like superior weapons.

23:52.460 --> 23:55.163
Or resurrect a dead teammate.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.632
You can bring them back?

23:58.166 --> 24:01.302
Apparently. I've never done it.

24:01.369 --> 24:02.570
And the third option?

24:03.371 --> 24:04.506
3. HAVE YOUR MEMORY WIPED AND QUIT.

24:04.572 --> 24:05.573
Graduation.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.309
You'll be free!

24:08.376 --> 24:09.411
Free?

24:10.412 --> 24:13.848
Score 100 points
and you can leave this all behind.

24:14.315 --> 24:19.387
You'll forget all about the Gantz games
and go back to your regular life.

24:21.323 --> 24:23.725
Anyway, it's good, isn't it?

24:24.392 --> 24:27.295
We won't have to do anything.

24:27.762 --> 24:30.765
The Osaka guys will wipe out the monsters.

24:31.266 --> 24:36.671
I'll let them have the small ones,
and I'll take the Boss at the end.

24:40.208 --> 24:45.547
Nishi's strategy is to hide and wait
for the strongest one at the end.

24:45.914 --> 24:49.551
Killing the Boss scores you
a lot of points.

24:50.652 --> 24:51.619
Help!

25:00.261 --> 25:02.464
We have to help those people.

25:03.231 --> 25:04.432
Come on, Suzuki.

25:05.633 --> 25:08.503
We should avoid any unnecessary risks.

25:08.570 --> 25:09.537
Suzuki!

25:11.239 --> 25:13.541
-But isn't that what you do?
-Well...

25:13.608 --> 25:15.410
Not without our leader...

25:15.677 --> 25:16.778
Come on!

25:20.348 --> 25:23.284
We're not tough enough
to protect other people.

25:37.398 --> 25:41.736
We can leave it to the Osaka team...

25:42.637 --> 25:46.608
so that we can just concentrate
on surviving, okay?

25:47.776 --> 25:50.778
Kato, wait! Kato!

25:55.550 --> 25:58.787
If you must go, keep this.

26:02.290 --> 26:04.492
Someone's waiting for your call.

26:04.859 --> 26:08.563
There are still some pay phones around.

26:13.768 --> 26:17.705
Make sure that you don't die.

26:48.503 --> 26:49.704
It's good.

26:51.506 --> 26:53.374
All the sauce we want!

27:02.650 --> 27:05.420
Do you see that there?

27:09.424 --> 27:10.491
Yeah...

27:12.026 --> 27:13.828
It's no Biriken statue.

27:21.736 --> 27:23.538
He's spooky.

27:37.418 --> 27:38.886
The Kato residence.

27:41.122 --> 27:42.423
Hello?

27:44.459 --> 27:46.594
Ayumu, it's me.

27:47.862 --> 27:51.032
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

27:52.066 --> 27:53.067
Sorry.

27:54.135 --> 27:55.970
I was called into work.

27:56.738 --> 27:59.007
On a night like this?

27:59.641 --> 28:01.976
With what's happening in Osaka?

28:05.713 --> 28:07.515
What's happening there?

28:08.416 --> 28:11.419
Some monsters are running wild in Osaka.

28:13.021 --> 28:14.422
Really?

28:15.590 --> 28:16.824
I had no idea.

28:17.992 --> 28:21.763
How is that even possible?
Anyway, just come home.

28:23.464 --> 28:24.465
Sorry.

28:25.667 --> 28:27.001
It'll be a while.

28:28.770 --> 28:31.839
Okay, see you later.

28:31.906 --> 28:32.840
Ayumu.

28:34.475 --> 28:35.510
What?

28:38.980 --> 28:40.615
I will come home.

28:42.216 --> 28:45.820
I know that!
I'll eat first, then go to bed.

29:04.105 --> 29:05.006
It's here!

29:19.120 --> 29:20.121
Damn it!

30:31.292 --> 30:32.794
Hi there!

30:36.898 --> 30:39.000
You with the Tokyo team?

30:40.868 --> 30:41.936
Right.

30:42.737 --> 30:46.741
I'm Anzu Yamasaki,
from the Osaka team. And you?

30:49.143 --> 30:50.878
I'm Masaru Kato.

30:51.846 --> 30:54.816
How old are you? I'm 23.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.051
Seventeen.

30:57.685 --> 31:01.089
A high-school boy! You're just a kid.

31:04.659 --> 31:06.794
I've been watching you.

31:08.029 --> 31:11.065
I got really curious about...

31:11.632 --> 31:13.868
what you were doing.

31:15.736 --> 31:18.272
I'm sure I'm wrong, but...

31:19.073 --> 31:22.243
Did you just save that family?

31:24.378 --> 31:26.747
What were you really doing?

31:27.648 --> 31:28.649
Well...

31:29.817 --> 31:31.352
I saved the family.

31:31.619 --> 31:34.789
Oh, my God, it's impossible!

31:34.856 --> 31:35.823
I did.

31:35.890 --> 31:38.025
No! No one does that.

31:38.392 --> 31:39.694
But I did!

31:40.361 --> 31:44.098
Would you just watch someone get killed?

31:47.034 --> 31:48.269
Phony Alien!

31:53.708 --> 31:55.376
Are you upset?

31:56.144 --> 31:57.411
I'll help people.

31:58.279 --> 31:59.881
Quit it.

32:00.648 --> 32:02.416
You hypocrite.

32:03.351 --> 32:04.886
Don't follow me.

32:05.787 --> 32:09.991
Lighten up. I love watching weirdos.

32:12.827 --> 32:14.328
You're funny.

32:15.897 --> 32:19.333
I know you won't last long.

32:23.037 --> 32:24.305
I just remembered.

32:25.206 --> 32:28.843
I saw a kid hiding with some old people.

32:29.343 --> 32:31.312
I hope they're okay.

32:31.379 --> 32:32.980
Where are they?

32:34.982 --> 32:36.884
You're such a show-off!

32:40.254 --> 32:44.759
Don't cry or the monsters will get us.

32:45.092 --> 32:48.195
We're finished. It's just like hell.

32:48.796 --> 32:51.165
It's okay if I die...

32:51.232 --> 32:54.268
but not the boy.

32:54.769 --> 32:57.138
His life's just begun.

32:57.204 --> 32:59.807
I want to take him to his parents.

33:03.144 --> 33:05.479
Get away from it!

33:06.047 --> 33:08.950
You run! I'll take care of it!

33:09.016 --> 33:10.284
Honey!

33:20.895 --> 33:22.330
Honey!

33:27.235 --> 33:28.169
Honey!

33:35.910 --> 33:36.777
There they are.

33:38.312 --> 33:40.748
Are you okay? I'll save you!

33:41.382 --> 33:42.783
Back away!

33:46.387 --> 33:47.388
Run!

33:47.888 --> 33:49.924
No. I'll save them!

33:49.991 --> 33:52.927
No way. You can't beat him!

33:56.998 --> 33:58.065
I'll save them.

33:58.799 --> 34:00.234
Don't you dare!

34:01.535 --> 34:03.471
I know you're scared.

34:05.339 --> 34:07.542
You'll die, you blockhead!

34:10.344 --> 34:14.014
Stop! He'll seriously kill you!

34:14.348 --> 34:15.449
You idiot!

34:19.820 --> 34:22.156
He can die if he wants to.

34:22.223 --> 34:25.326
He's just a hopeless moron...

34:27.027 --> 34:30.797
He is kind of cute though.

34:32.867 --> 34:35.268
Is there anything I can do, boy?

34:35.835 --> 34:36.971
Just move away.

34:37.871 --> 34:39.940
Idiots like that are rare.

34:41.242 --> 34:42.909
One of a kind...

34:51.585 --> 34:53.120
Get back!

34:55.222 --> 34:56.389
What's this?

34:59.894 --> 35:02.430
Maybe I'm scared...

35:04.932 --> 35:06.500
...to see him die.

35:28.322 --> 35:29.490
How can I beat him?

35:33.561 --> 35:35.363
What an idiot!

35:46.273 --> 35:47.274
Damn it!

36:20.374 --> 36:21.275
Excuse me!

37:00.614 --> 37:01.949
Now what?

37:31.345 --> 37:32.346
Hey!

37:37.151 --> 37:38.185
Are you okay?

37:41.689 --> 37:43.724
Hey, are you okay?

38:02.543 --> 38:05.412
Is there a doctor or a paramedic?

38:07.147 --> 38:10.117
Someone call an ambulance!

38:12.152 --> 38:16.223
Major roads are swarming with citizens.

38:16.791 --> 38:21.529
Experts say that the creatures
are not of this Earth

38:21.595 --> 38:24.098
but of alien origin.

38:24.465 --> 38:26.433
You're gonna save more people?

38:30.271 --> 38:31.238
Yeah.

38:33.073 --> 38:37.311
Why are you acting like such a hero?

38:38.746 --> 38:40.147
Leave it alone.

38:40.781 --> 38:46.320
I'm just curious about your upbringing.

38:48.422 --> 38:51.258
What do your parents do?

38:52.760 --> 38:53.794
My parents?

38:55.796 --> 38:57.698
Dad was a firefighter.

38:58.499 --> 39:01.268
He died with Mom in a car accident.

39:02.169 --> 39:04.705
When I was in junior high.

39:08.209 --> 39:09.343
Any siblings?

39:10.344 --> 39:12.079
A brother, 10.

39:12.446 --> 39:14.782
Is he in an orphanage?

39:15.749 --> 39:19.219
I work so we can live in an apartment.

39:20.688 --> 39:25.159
If you don't survive,
your brother would be left alone.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.528
Right.

39:28.429 --> 39:31.698
I live with my 3-year-old son.

39:32.466 --> 39:34.234
You're a mom?

39:35.436 --> 39:37.738
Yeah. Do I look too young?

39:40.741 --> 39:45.279
Hey! Just say "yes"
whenever you're asked that.

39:50.885 --> 39:54.521
Anyway, we're both in a similar situation.

39:56.423 --> 39:58.292
We can't afford to die.

39:58.859 --> 39:59.893
Never.

40:02.596 --> 40:03.631
Right.

40:05.199 --> 40:06.533
We can't die.

40:10.504 --> 40:14.441
Military personnel have been deployed

40:14.642 --> 40:17.244
all across the city.

40:18.879 --> 40:22.850
We have an update on the mysterious people
in black suits.

40:23.851 --> 40:27.421
This footage was just uploaded
to a video site.

40:28.455 --> 40:33.761
A young man in black fought
to protect an old couple and a child.

40:39.333 --> 40:41.168
THEY EXIST!

40:41.235 --> 40:43.404
-I'M IMPRESSED.
-GO, OSAKA!

40:43.470 --> 40:45.806
-SEE THE NEWS?
-IS IT REAL?

40:45.873 --> 40:48.575
-THE TV SAYS SO.
-GO, BLACK SUIT!

40:56.283 --> 40:57.417
Go now!

40:57.484 --> 40:58.686
Thank you.

41:09.363 --> 41:11.632
-Use the big gun!
-Not yet!

41:11.698 --> 41:13.367
I'll do it.

41:14.401 --> 41:17.571
There's something crazy about them...

41:22.242 --> 41:24.511
Guys like them always survive.

41:25.913 --> 41:27.548
That dark-skinned one...

41:27.815 --> 41:29.717
We call him George.

41:30.517 --> 41:32.686
His real name is Shimaki.

41:33.587 --> 41:34.955
He's won three bonuses.

41:37.524 --> 41:39.560
The tall skinhead is Nobuo Muroya.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.262
We call him Nobuyan.

41:42.963 --> 41:44.498
He's won four times.

41:45.532 --> 41:47.568
He's a megalomaniac.

41:47.968 --> 41:49.269
And he's a reckless...

41:50.704 --> 41:52.306
self-appointed leader.

41:53.006 --> 41:53.874
But...

41:55.009 --> 41:56.710
there's one more.

41:57.945 --> 41:59.313
Really?

42:00.647 --> 42:04.284
Hachiro Oka, a seven-time bonus winner.

42:05.719 --> 42:07.421
He's somewhere.

42:09.289 --> 42:11.458
He cloaks himself and goes into hiding.

42:22.770 --> 42:25.339
Good...

42:38.685 --> 42:40.921
I hope Kato is doing okay.

42:45.325 --> 42:46.360
What's wrong?

42:48.695 --> 42:50.430
If Kurono was alive,

42:50.931 --> 42:54.768
would he have saved people like Kato?

42:55.869 --> 42:59.339
I'm sure he would have.

43:00.774 --> 43:04.611
We can resurrect Kurono if we score 100.

43:05.779 --> 43:08.782
We don't have a chance.

43:09.917 --> 43:11.552
But, Suzuki...

43:11.618 --> 43:15.589
We can hardly take care of ourselves.

43:19.826 --> 43:20.894
Oh, no!

44:14.948 --> 44:17.384
There's one in Japan?

44:21.588 --> 44:23.757
Is it on our side?

44:49.650 --> 44:52.586
The Boss creature should be 100 points.

44:53.120 --> 44:56.156
One hundred points for one creature?

44:56.556 --> 44:58.525
Yeah, 100 for one.

44:58.926 --> 45:03.697
The monsters on the tower look badass.

45:04.598 --> 45:07.634
Killing one won't get 100 points.

45:07.701 --> 45:11.138
Oka says it's happened before.

45:11.204 --> 45:12.472
Really?

45:13.440 --> 45:17.444
It was before our time.
Before we went to the room.

45:18.512 --> 45:20.847
Everyone died except Oka.

45:21.582 --> 45:23.750
Oka killed the Boss monster.

45:24.151 --> 45:25.452
By himself!

45:26.620 --> 45:28.522
He's a monster himself!

45:46.473 --> 45:47.207
Oh, God.

45:48.475 --> 45:49.576
What's that?

45:50.577 --> 45:53.814
It's way out of our league.

45:53.880 --> 45:56.116
Freeze! Put your hands up!

45:58.251 --> 45:59.519
Wait!

46:01.121 --> 46:01.989
Don't shoot!

46:05.559 --> 46:06.693
Kato!

46:07.094 --> 46:08.028
Don't shoot!

46:08.795 --> 46:11.932
You in the black suits! Who are you with?

46:12.232 --> 46:13.834
-I'll shoot!
-Wait!

46:14.735 --> 46:18.572
-We're agents.
-State your unit.

46:19.039 --> 46:20.140
Our unit is...

46:20.874 --> 46:21.875
Gantz.

46:23.577 --> 46:24.711
Gantz?

46:28.014 --> 46:30.150
He's in even more trouble!

46:30.650 --> 46:32.686
-Show your ID!
-We don't have any.

46:32.986 --> 46:34.254
But it's true!

46:34.521 --> 46:35.789
-I'll shoot!
-No!

46:36.256 --> 46:37.291
Wait a minute.

46:58.612 --> 46:59.846
Fire!

47:03.984 --> 47:05.886
Run, all of you!

47:22.736 --> 47:23.837
Watch Suzuki!

47:47.794 --> 47:48.995
Come and get me!

48:31.304 --> 48:32.339
No way.

48:53.226 --> 48:54.294
Well?

48:56.930 --> 48:57.931
Hey.

48:58.798 --> 49:00.934
You're shitting me.

49:07.140 --> 49:08.775
It's not dead.

49:09.876 --> 49:11.278
Is it a 100?

49:12.178 --> 49:13.447
I'll do him.

49:17.917 --> 49:21.388
You'll be flatter than paper
when I'm through.

49:34.868 --> 49:37.771
Pretty tough, aren't you?

49:37.837 --> 49:39.139
You cockroach.

50:03.997 --> 50:05.432
Stop playing!

50:08.234 --> 50:10.036
You fuck!

50:19.913 --> 50:23.083
You goddamn motherfucker!

50:25.318 --> 50:27.053
Fucking help!

50:27.120 --> 50:31.324
Boo-hoo, can't you take care of yourself?

50:48.542 --> 50:52.479
I bet you shit your pants, Muroya.

51:03.923 --> 51:05.392
Fuck...

51:08.128 --> 51:09.262
He's dead.

51:10.497 --> 51:11.464
No way!

51:26.913 --> 51:28.548
So, you're their boss?

51:29.416 --> 51:31.117
That old man?

51:39.826 --> 51:41.528
Gotcha!

52:00.146 --> 52:01.314
What the...?

52:02.949 --> 52:05.084
What is this?

52:06.152 --> 52:08.054
What is it?

52:52.599 --> 52:54.934
I've caught you!

53:18.124 --> 53:20.326
This can't be true!

53:21.194 --> 53:22.595
They're both dead!

53:27.200 --> 53:28.401
What's your plan?

53:30.537 --> 53:33.273
I'll do whatever I can.

53:33.673 --> 53:35.308
You'll die!

53:35.575 --> 53:37.610
Think of your brother!

53:37.677 --> 53:40.313
That's why it has to be done.

53:41.714 --> 53:43.349
Otherwise...

53:44.217 --> 53:45.652
we'll all die.

53:48.555 --> 53:50.189
But how?

53:50.957 --> 53:54.494
Hey! Hey! Don't be stupid!

54:31.364 --> 54:32.532
She just dodges it!

54:43.243 --> 54:44.644
She's too quick.

54:46.412 --> 54:47.580
All together!

55:12.338 --> 55:13.373
She was hit.

55:26.085 --> 55:28.421
A hit to the head has no effect!

55:32.625 --> 55:33.693
Cover me.

55:39.365 --> 55:42.435
Ayumu, I promise you.

55:43.770 --> 55:45.572
I'll come home!

56:37.390 --> 56:39.158
I got the Boss!

56:52.271 --> 56:55.408
You almost blew us all up!

56:55.775 --> 57:00.246
Big deal! I went for his arm anyway.

57:04.851 --> 57:06.386
We made it...

57:07.820 --> 57:10.156
We beat the Osaka team.

57:30.643 --> 57:31.711
No...

57:32.779 --> 57:34.714
What the heck?

57:39.218 --> 57:40.353
Oh, God!

58:01.407 --> 58:02.408
Run.

58:07.880 --> 58:08.881
Run!

01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:06.966
We lost...

01:00:07.433 --> 01:00:08.834
Look at its head.

01:00:18.878 --> 01:00:20.880
-It's Oka.
-Oka?

01:00:21.714 --> 01:00:22.882
Hachiro Oka!

01:00:37.363 --> 01:00:38.631
He got it!

01:00:53.512 --> 01:00:54.747
Still bleeding.

01:00:55.748 --> 01:00:58.584
Hey, can you hear me?

01:01:00.987 --> 01:01:03.456
Kato, look at that!

01:01:06.826 --> 01:01:07.927
It's alive.

01:01:08.694 --> 01:01:09.629
Shit!

01:01:14.433 --> 01:01:15.401
Oka...

01:01:18.004 --> 01:01:21.941
So, if you live to the end of the game,
you'll recover?

01:01:22.008 --> 01:01:23.976
Well, yes...

01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:27.580
If Oka beats him quickly,

01:01:28.781 --> 01:01:30.116
it will help.

01:01:43.129 --> 01:01:44.797
It's too powerful!

01:01:45.798 --> 01:01:48.134
I don't even know how it attacked me.

01:01:50.202 --> 01:01:51.904
Oka can do it.

01:01:52.938 --> 01:01:54.640
He'll beat it!

01:01:55.574 --> 01:01:57.176
He's won seven times.

01:01:57.844 --> 01:01:59.078
Hachiro Oka.

01:02:18.164 --> 01:02:23.135
You're deluded
if you think you can beat me, sucker!

01:02:32.745 --> 01:02:36.249
What you don't know is,
I played Ping-Pong in college!

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:46.792
I also took karate lessons...

01:02:47.693 --> 01:02:49.662
by correspondence!

01:03:12.685 --> 01:03:13.986
Amazing.

01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:16.822
Did he win...?

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:19.792
You want to die?

01:03:21.827 --> 01:03:24.764
It's not over. Can't you see?

01:03:33.706 --> 01:03:37.076
I find this fascinating.

01:03:38.144 --> 01:03:40.246
Very fascinating.

01:03:51.257 --> 01:03:53.325
I think I got it.

01:04:03.969 --> 01:04:07.006
I've got it. Here I go!

01:04:29.729 --> 01:04:31.630
He'll lose...

01:04:32.798 --> 01:04:34.600
Come on, boy!

01:04:53.285 --> 01:04:54.687
Oka, no!

01:05:18.344 --> 01:05:19.912
Eat this!

01:05:36.862 --> 01:05:39.732
Only intuitive attacks work on him.

01:05:48.107 --> 01:05:50.442
Is it over? Did he die?

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:52.344
Not yet.

01:05:52.778 --> 01:05:55.080
-No?
-What do you mean?

01:05:55.848 --> 01:05:58.884
Only surprise attacks work. I'll go cloak.

01:05:58.951 --> 01:06:01.854
You should finish him off now!

01:06:03.088 --> 01:06:04.457
No, it's risky.

01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:11.030
Damn it...

01:06:18.337 --> 01:06:19.438
It is risky.

01:06:20.706 --> 01:06:21.874
I know.

01:06:22.741 --> 01:06:23.909
But...

01:06:25.244 --> 01:06:26.879
someone's got to do it.

01:06:29.248 --> 01:06:30.282
Kato!

01:07:02.181 --> 01:07:03.249
Kato!

01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:13.259
Suzuki! Why did you...?

01:07:14.894 --> 01:07:16.328
Your brother...

01:07:17.796 --> 01:07:19.965
He's waiting for you.

01:07:23.235 --> 01:07:25.537
Suzuki! Suzuki!

01:07:53.799 --> 01:07:54.900
Reika.

01:07:56.235 --> 01:07:57.937
Watch Suzuki.

01:07:59.204 --> 01:08:00.205
But it's...

01:08:01.006 --> 01:08:01.874
too late.

01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:05.344
We can save him.

01:08:11.483 --> 01:08:12.885
What about you?

01:08:13.452 --> 01:08:14.553
I'll do it.

01:08:17.323 --> 01:08:18.457
I'll finish the game.

01:08:20.426 --> 01:08:22.361
-Kato!
-Don't!

01:08:29.135 --> 01:08:31.569
Where's that other guy?

01:08:32.371 --> 01:08:34.340
He was fun to play with.

01:09:04.036 --> 01:09:07.939
Stay here. I'll kill you later.

01:09:12.877 --> 01:09:15.514
Hey, are you okay?

01:09:17.483 --> 01:09:22.587
-What now?
-We can run and leave it to Oka!

01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:24.523
And if he loses?

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:26.225
But...

01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:29.461
We have to think of a way to win!

01:09:30.062 --> 01:09:31.563
It's impossible.

01:09:32.363 --> 01:09:36.167
We can't die.
We both have someone waiting for us.

01:09:40.573 --> 01:09:42.341
That's why I'm going.

01:09:44.676 --> 01:09:46.078
I have to!

01:09:47.613 --> 01:09:50.582
I have to! Who else will?

01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:54.286
You're right.

01:09:55.687 --> 01:09:57.055
We have to.

01:09:58.090 --> 01:09:58.957
Reika.

01:09:59.024 --> 01:10:01.493
How can we beat that thing?

01:10:03.529 --> 01:10:06.632
Oka said it must be a surprise attack.

01:10:07.266 --> 01:10:09.368
How do we surprise him?

01:10:10.302 --> 01:10:11.670
Maybe we can snipe him.

01:10:16.175 --> 01:10:17.276
Good idea.

01:10:18.243 --> 01:10:22.648
I'll be a decoy. When he approaches,
shoot him from a distance.

01:10:23.115 --> 01:10:25.384
Are you out of your mind?!

01:10:29.688 --> 01:10:31.590
We have no choice.

01:10:35.394 --> 01:10:38.997
Are you sure we want to snipe him?

01:11:12.998 --> 01:11:14.266
Ayumu.

01:11:20.706 --> 01:11:21.707
What's wrong?

01:11:24.643 --> 01:11:26.078
Listen.

01:11:27.312 --> 01:11:30.115
I have to say this before I go.

01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:33.418
You...

01:11:35.154 --> 01:11:38.190
You mean a lot to me.

01:11:43.562 --> 01:11:44.797
Please don't die.

01:11:47.232 --> 01:11:49.101
Do not die, okay?

01:11:51.703 --> 01:11:53.272
I don't intend to.

01:11:57.142 --> 01:11:58.344
You mean it?

01:11:59.411 --> 01:12:01.213
You really mean it?

01:12:02.314 --> 01:12:03.315
Yes.

01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:09.354
I won't give up,
even if the odds are against me.

01:12:15.094 --> 01:12:16.561
Promise me.

01:12:17.829 --> 01:12:21.266
If you survive,
the four of us can live together.

01:12:22.367 --> 01:12:25.604
You, your brother, me, and my boy.

01:12:27.172 --> 01:12:30.742
All right? Make a promise.

01:12:36.681 --> 01:12:37.816
Come on!

01:12:39.284 --> 01:12:43.088
Just say "yes" when you're asked that.

01:12:48.594 --> 01:12:49.628
Yes.

01:12:52.364 --> 01:12:53.598
It's a promise.

01:12:56.268 --> 01:12:57.702
Don't break it!

01:13:03.742 --> 01:13:04.843
I'll protect you.

01:13:06.478 --> 01:13:07.679
I won't let you die!

01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:12.684
Watch me get a bull's-eye on that thing!

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.229
I will make it home.

01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:28.834
For sure.

01:13:36.641 --> 01:13:37.843
What the...?

01:14:13.445 --> 01:14:16.215
They're not in position yet...

01:14:29.327 --> 01:14:30.362
Wait.

01:14:33.765 --> 01:14:35.200
Let me ask you.

01:14:36.668 --> 01:14:39.238
Why are we...

01:14:40.205 --> 01:14:41.940
killing each other?

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:48.447
Do you feel that you're in God's presence?

01:14:49.347 --> 01:14:50.282
God?

01:14:51.449 --> 01:14:55.587
God is the absolute power.

01:14:58.257 --> 01:14:59.724
You're God...

01:15:00.825 --> 01:15:02.527
are you?

01:15:02.994 --> 01:15:08.266
This world has many.
I'm merely one of them.

01:15:08.934 --> 01:15:12.871
There is no defying that fact.

01:15:19.744 --> 01:15:21.246
I hit him!

01:15:30.822 --> 01:15:32.357
We'll live together!

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:34.927
I'll end this!

01:15:36.461 --> 01:15:37.529
Die!

01:15:45.537 --> 01:15:46.805
I got it.

01:15:47.606 --> 01:15:48.640
I see.

01:15:51.743 --> 01:15:53.946
I can finish him off!

01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:03.288
He's just shooting blind.

01:16:57.876 --> 01:16:59.011
Kato!

01:18:43.481 --> 01:18:45.517
I got the Big Boss.

01:20:47.872 --> 01:20:49.040
It's over.

01:20:51.075 --> 01:20:52.944
It's really over.

01:22:26.905 --> 01:22:28.039
But I...

01:22:29.907 --> 01:22:31.976
I was of no help.

01:22:32.944 --> 01:22:34.178
Me neither.

01:22:34.946 --> 01:22:36.848
Kato did everything.

01:22:39.017 --> 01:22:40.118
Where is he?

01:22:41.252 --> 01:22:42.220
Oh, no!

01:22:44.055 --> 01:22:45.256
I guess he's dead.

01:22:47.225 --> 01:22:48.793
No...

01:22:49.894 --> 01:22:51.229
He did so much...

01:22:51.929 --> 01:22:53.097
Gantz.

01:22:54.098 --> 01:22:55.833
Score me.

01:23:03.708 --> 01:23:05.210
Live from Osaka.

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:10.048
With no explosions,
the Dotonbori area is very quiet.

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:11.149
EAT BY YOURSELF.

01:23:12.484 --> 01:23:15.186
There's no sign of the creatures.

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:20.058
Soldiers are assessing the situation.

01:23:22.861 --> 01:23:25.230
We only returned because of Kato...

01:23:52.823 --> 01:23:53.858
Kato!

01:23:56.394 --> 01:23:57.762
I...

01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:00.231
You survived.

01:24:01.099 --> 01:24:01.966
Oh, God!

01:24:02.834 --> 01:24:04.469
I'm so happy.

01:24:05.904 --> 01:24:07.372
You barely made it.

01:24:16.047 --> 01:24:18.850
It's time to score your points.

01:24:29.127 --> 01:24:30.862
Jugs, six points.

01:24:34.399 --> 01:24:36.167
Baldy, two points.

01:24:39.971 --> 01:24:41.973
Nishi, 12 points.

01:24:44.943 --> 01:24:47.912
It's your turn, Kato.

01:24:52.884 --> 01:24:56.053
Kato-cha, LOL, 100 points.

01:24:56.588 --> 01:24:58.356
-Shit!
-Amazing!

01:24:58.423 --> 01:25:00.057
You cleared it!

01:25:00.992 --> 01:25:02.293
Did I...?

01:25:05.429 --> 01:25:07.265
Bonus menu.

01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:11.502
One, weapon.
Two, resurrection. Three, freedom.

01:25:24.415 --> 01:25:27.451
2. RESURRECT A DEAD PLAYER.

01:25:27.518 --> 01:25:29.587
3. HAVE YOUR MEMORY WIPED AND QUIT.

01:25:29.854 --> 01:25:31.422
Choose three and you're free.

01:25:32.190 --> 01:25:35.927
And go back to living
with your brother like before.

01:25:36.627 --> 01:25:37.629
I'm happy for you.

01:25:39.597 --> 01:25:40.632
Kato.

01:25:41.866 --> 01:25:42.900
Thank you.

01:25:43.568 --> 01:25:44.936
Goodbye.

01:25:45.469 --> 01:25:46.537
Have a nice life.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.207
Hey...?

01:26:27.245 --> 01:26:28.679
I didn't die...

01:26:40.191 --> 01:26:41.492
Oh, that fool...

01:26:44.228 --> 01:26:46.597
That hypocrite!

01:26:52.136 --> 01:26:56.140
KATO-CHA (LOL) 100 POINTS

01:27:12.123 --> 01:27:15.059
You think she was resurrected?

01:27:16.327 --> 01:27:18.396
But why, Kato?

01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:21.365
What about your brother?

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.736
You'll have to join the game again.

01:27:25.436 --> 01:27:27.204
You could die.

01:27:28.205 --> 01:27:31.209
But I made her a promise.

01:27:38.115 --> 01:27:39.484
That's lame.

01:27:45.356 --> 01:27:46.691
I can leave?

01:27:52.296 --> 01:27:55.333
My brother's waiting at home!

01:28:10.782 --> 01:28:12.550
You didn't tell Kato

01:28:13.517 --> 01:28:16.387
that he used to fight with us.

01:28:16.754 --> 01:28:18.356
Your brother's waiting.

01:28:20.591 --> 01:28:21.792
Choose three.

01:28:25.329 --> 01:28:26.297
Kei...

01:28:32.336 --> 01:28:38.109
If I had, he'd fight to resurrect
everyone who'd ever died in the game.

01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:40.545
You're right.

01:28:47.051 --> 01:28:50.054
I choose three. Free me.

01:28:57.828 --> 01:29:01.332
I never thought he'd be back!

01:29:03.568 --> 01:29:05.736
He hasn't changed a bit.

01:29:08.406 --> 01:29:11.375
Every time it's the same for him.

01:29:12.343 --> 01:29:15.679
He risks his life for others.

01:29:17.815 --> 01:29:20.518
Kurono was like that, too.

01:29:25.456 --> 01:29:26.824
I'll do the same.

01:29:30.127 --> 01:29:31.095
One day...

01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:34.365
I'll get Kurono back.

01:29:50.147 --> 01:29:51.148
I'm home!
