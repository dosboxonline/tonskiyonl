WEBVTT

01:05.920 --> 01:09.480
in this harbor town

01:09.560 --> 01:12.600
layin' whiskey down

01:13.240 --> 01:17.040
fetch another round"

01:17.200 --> 01:20.240
them whiskey and wine

01:20.400 --> 01:24.360
"Brandy, you're a fine girl"

01:24.560 --> 01:28.400
wife you would be"

01:39.440 --> 01:41.320
EGO: Come on!
MEREDITH:
Slow down!

01:41.400 --> 01:43.400
This way, my river lily!
Come on!

01:46.200 --> 01:47.520
Where are you taking me?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
Come on, come on.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.880
Look. Look!

01:51.080 --> 01:53.000
Oh, it's beautiful!

01:53.160 --> 01:55.240
EGO: I was afraid
it wouldn't take
to the soil...

01:55.400 --> 01:56.640
but it rooted quickly.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.480
And soon,
it'll be everywhere.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.680
All across the universe.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.080
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

02:06.160 --> 02:07.800
but I like the way
you say it.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.720
My heart is yours...

02:10.760 --> 02:12.480
Meredith Quill.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.880
I can't believe
I fell in love
with a spaceman.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.480
(MUSIC FADING UP,
"BRANDY (YOU'RE A FINE GIRL")

03:09.560 --> 03:11.640
Showtime, a-holes!

03:12.360 --> 03:14.560
It will be here any minute.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.520
Which will be its loss.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.240
I thought your thing
was a sword?

03:18.360 --> 03:20.560
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...

03:20.640 --> 03:21.880
from feeding on
those batteries,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.200
and I'm gonna stop it
with a sword?

03:23.240 --> 03:25.480
It's just,
swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.360
But I guess we're
both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.880
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

03:32.040 --> 03:33.360
It hurts.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.560
It hurts?

03:36.120 --> 03:37.760
I have sensitive nipples.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.680
"My nipples hurt!
Oh, goodness me!"

03:41.760 --> 03:43.560
What about him?
What's he doing?

03:43.600 --> 03:46.040
I'm finishing
this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.520
How is that
a priority?

03:47.600 --> 03:50.080
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.760
No, I actually agree
with Drax on this.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.320
That's hardly
important right now.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.760
Oh, okay.
Sure, Quill.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.800
No, seriously,
I side with Drax.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.280
No, I understand that.
You're being very
serious right now.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.760
I can clearly
see you winking.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.200
Damn it.
I'm using my left eye?

04:13.040 --> 04:14.360
I am Groot.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.800
They were not
looking at you funny.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.120
Well, that's intense.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.360
Groot!

05:41.720 --> 05:44.040
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

05:44.200 --> 05:45.200
Hi.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.920
No! Spit it out!

06:30.080 --> 06:31.280
Come on!

06:34.280 --> 06:35.680
Disgusting!

07:37.360 --> 07:40.240
The beast's hide
is too thick to be
pierced from the outside.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.520
I must cut through it
from the inside.

07:42.680 --> 07:43.720
Huh?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.240
No, no!
Drax, wait a minute!

07:46.320 --> 07:47.360
Drax!

07:57.040 --> 07:58.360
What is he doing?

07:58.520 --> 08:01.400
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from
the outside, so he...

08:01.520 --> 08:03.360
That doesn't make any sense!
I tried telling him that!

08:03.400 --> 08:04.680
Skin is the same
level of thickness

08:04.800 --> 08:06.040
from the inside
as from the outside!

08:06.120 --> 08:07.760
I realize that.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.520
There is a cut
on its neck.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.920
Rocket, get it to look up.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.000
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey!
Up here!

08:29.720 --> 08:31.200
Watch it, Quill!

09:18.080 --> 09:20.160
Yes!
I have single-handedly...

09:21.120 --> 09:22.440
vanquished the beast!

09:25.440 --> 09:26.600
What?

09:36.600 --> 09:37.960
What are they called again?

09:38.440 --> 09:39.880
Anulax batteries.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.240
Harbulary batteries.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.720
That's nothing
like what I just said.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.680
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

09:46.760 --> 09:48.840
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.120
Careful what you say
around these folks.
They're easily offended.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.160
The cost of
transgression
is death.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.640
AYESHA:
We thank you, Guardians,

09:57.800 --> 09:59.680
for putting your
lives on the line.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.840
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.560
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed
by the community.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.840
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.320
We control the DNA
of our progeny...

10:14.360 --> 10:16.720
germinating them
in birthing pods.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.360
I guess
I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.080
Perhaps someday,
you could give me
a history lesson...

10:24.560 --> 10:27.720
in the archaic ways
of our ancestors.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.000
For academic purposes.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.000
I would be honored, yes.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.160
In the name of research...

10:34.320 --> 10:36.840
I think that could be
pretty, uh...

10:37.000 --> 10:38.240
repulsive.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.520
I'm not into that
kind of casual...

10:40.680 --> 10:41.720
Oh, please.

10:41.880 --> 10:45.200
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.680
Bring it...

10:46.840 --> 10:48.440
and we shall
gladly be on our way.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.800
Family reunion. Yay.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.400
I understand
she is your sister.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.880
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due
for her on Xandar.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.440
Our soldiers apprehended
her attempting to steal
the batteries.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.400
Do with her
as you please.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.680
We thank you,
High Priestess Ayesha.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.600
What is your heritage,
Mr. Quill?

11:30.880 --> 11:32.400
My mother is from Earth.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.480
And your father?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.600
I see it within you.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.320
An unorthodox genealogy.

11:44.480 --> 11:48.720
A hybrid that
seems particularly...

11:49.680 --> 11:51.240
reckless.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.360
You know,
they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

11:56.600 --> 11:58.080
but that isn't
true at all.

12:02.960 --> 12:03.960
ROCKET: Oh, shit.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.200
I'm using my
wrong eye again,
aren't I?

12:06.360 --> 12:08.720
I'm sorry.
That was meant to be
behind your back.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.400
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.280
You're telling me.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.520
You wanna buy some batteries?

12:28.320 --> 12:30.800
ROCKET: All right,
let's get baldy to Xandar

12:30.880 --> 12:32.320
and collect that bounty.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.720
That stuff
about my father...

13:26.880 --> 13:28.880
Who does she think
she is?

13:29.040 --> 13:31.360
I know you're
sensitive about that.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.680
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.400
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with
the High Priestess.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.160
I wasn't.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.400
I don't care
if you were.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.360
Well, I feel like you do care.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.920
That's why I'm apologizing.
So, sorry!

13:47.080 --> 13:49.280
Gamora is not
the one for you, Quill.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.200
Damn shadow.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.520
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

13:53.600 --> 13:55.360
those who dance,
and those who do not.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.440
Mmm-hmm.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.640
I first met my beloved
at a war rally.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.840
Oh, God.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.840
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.560
Except one woman.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.280
My Ovette.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.240
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.040
The most melodic
song in the world
could be playing.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.760
She wouldn't
even tap her foot.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.720
Wouldn't move a muscle.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.600
One might assume
she was dead.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.240
That does sound
pretty hot.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.400
It would make
my nether regions engorge.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.440
Okay. I get it, yes.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.520
I'm a dancer,
Gamora is not.

14:30.560 --> 14:34.240
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
Mmm.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.520
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of
that yaro root.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.120
No. It's not ripe yet...

14:44.320 --> 14:45.360
and I hate you.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.720
You hate me?

14:46.880 --> 14:49.560
You left me there
while you stole that
stone for yourself.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.880
And yet here
you stand, a hero.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.440
I will be free
of these shackles

14:53.560 --> 14:54.880
soon enough,
and I will kill you.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.560
I swear.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.800
No.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.800
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days

14:59.920 --> 15:01.400
in a prison on Xandar...

15:01.560 --> 15:03.000
wishing you could.

15:09.840 --> 15:10.960
QUILL: This is weird.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.840
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.920
GAMORA:
Why would they do that?

15:13.960 --> 15:15.680
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.760
Dude!

15:17.160 --> 15:18.160
Right.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.520
He didn't steal some of those.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.440
I don't know why
they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.360
What were you thinking?

15:34.520 --> 15:35.920
Dude, they were
really easy to steal!

15:35.960 --> 15:37.480
That's your defense?
Come on!

15:37.560 --> 15:40.000
You saw how
that High Priestess
talked down to us.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.720
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

15:42.520 --> 15:45.120
Oh, I didn't realize
your motivation was
altruism.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.480
It's really a shame

15:46.560 --> 15:47.720
the Sovereign have mistaken
your intentions...

15:47.840 --> 15:49.560
and they're trying to kill us.
Exactly!

15:49.640 --> 15:51.440
I was being sarcastic!

15:51.480 --> 15:52.640
Oh, no!

15:52.720 --> 15:54.040
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!

15:54.120 --> 15:55.120
Now I look foolish!

15:55.440 --> 15:56.720
Can we put
the bickering on hold...

15:56.880 --> 15:58.920
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

15:59.080 --> 16:00.840
QUILL: More incoming!
ROCKET: Good!

16:00.880 --> 16:02.360
I wanna kill some guys!

16:10.240 --> 16:11.680
GAMORA:
You're not killing anyone.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.480
All those ships
are remotely piloted.

16:16.760 --> 16:17.760
Damn it!

16:28.480 --> 16:30.360
What is the delay,
Admiral?

16:30.520 --> 16:34.640
High Priestess,
the batteries, they are
exceptionally combustible...

16:34.800 --> 16:36.040
and could destroy
the entire fleet.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.840
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.680
We hired them and
they steal from us.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.280
It is heresy of
the highest order.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.160
All command modules...

16:49.360 --> 16:51.880
fire with the intent to kill.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.160
What's the nearest
habitable planet?

17:04.120 --> 17:05.440
It's called Berhert.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.360
How many jumps?
Only one.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.520
But the access point
is 47 clicks away.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.520
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.240
Quill, to make it
through that...

17:24.320 --> 17:26.000
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
Lucky for us, I...

17:27.320 --> 17:28.800
I am.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.320
ROCKET:
What are you doing?

17:42.480 --> 17:44.600
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.720
I was
cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.520
You were
cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

17:51.040 --> 17:52.040
Stop it.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.960
Later on tonight,
you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

17:54.040 --> 17:56.120
and there's gonna
be something squishy
in your pillow case.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.560
And you're gonna be like,
"What's this?"

17:57.760 --> 17:59.520
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

18:01.200 --> 18:03.400
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.960
Oh, it won't be my turd.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.560
It will be Drax's.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.960
I have famously huge turds.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.520
We're about to die,
and this is what
we're discussing?

18:16.240 --> 18:17.200
ROCKET: Son of a...

18:17.400 --> 18:18.960
QUILL: Dude! Seriously!

18:19.520 --> 18:20.520
ROCKET: Hey! Let me...

18:34.880 --> 18:36.200
Idiots!

18:36.360 --> 18:37.680
Well, that's what you get

18:37.800 --> 18:39.040
when Quill flies.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.480
Ow!

18:40.760 --> 18:43.000
We still have
a Sovereign craft
behind us.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.680
Our weapons are down.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.920
20 clicks to the jump!

18:52.880 --> 18:53.880
Hold on.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.440
It's not ripe.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.400
Come on, Zylak.
You can do this.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.680
Yes!

19:22.840 --> 19:24.880
15 clicks to the jump!

19:25.320 --> 19:26.400
ALL: Come on!

19:27.200 --> 19:28.800
Keep going!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.240
10 clicks!

19:47.800 --> 19:49.560
Die, spaceship!

19:54.360 --> 19:55.600
You suck, Zylak.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.800
Typical.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.560
Five clicks!

20:06.320 --> 20:07.880
Son of a...

20:08.280 --> 20:10.200
They went around the field!

20:24.480 --> 20:26.800
Someone destroyed
all our ships!

20:26.960 --> 20:28.240
What?

20:30.960 --> 20:32.880
Who?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.280
GAMORA: One click!

20:36.440 --> 20:38.160
What is that?
Who cares?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.760
That's the jump point!
Go!

20:43.400 --> 20:45.160
It's a guy.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.160
Oh, my God.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.760
He's still out there?

21:21.880 --> 21:24.000
QUILL:
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

21:24.840 --> 21:27.160
Prepare for
a really bad landing!

22:07.840 --> 22:09.760
That was awesome!

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
Yes!

22:14.320 --> 22:15.600
GAMORA: Look at this!

22:16.360 --> 22:17.920
Where is the other
half of our ship?

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
QUILL: My ship.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.040
GAMORA:
Either one of you
could have gotten us

22:21.120 --> 22:22.880
through that field...

22:23.040 --> 22:24.360
had you flown with
what's between your ears

22:24.400 --> 22:25.920
instead of what's
between your legs!

22:26.560 --> 22:29.400
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

22:29.560 --> 22:31.760
I guarantee
I could have landed
this ship with it.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.560
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.240
More like because
he stole...

22:36.400 --> 22:37.600
the Anulax batteries!

22:37.760 --> 22:39.920
They're called
Harbulary batteries.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.600
No, they're not!

22:41.960 --> 22:43.720
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?

22:44.400 --> 22:45.760
I'm not gonna
answer to "Star-Munch."

22:45.960 --> 22:47.800
I did it because I wanted to!

22:47.920 --> 22:48.920
Dick.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.760
What are we even
talking about this for?

22:50.920 --> 22:53.600
We just had
a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

22:53.640 --> 22:54.640
How little?

22:54.760 --> 22:56.840
Well, I don't know, like this?

22:57.080 --> 22:58.640
A little
one-inch man saved us?

22:58.800 --> 23:01.120
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be
much larger.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.480
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.080
Don't call me a raccoon!

23:05.440 --> 23:07.880
I'm sorry.
I took it too far.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.040
I meant trash panda.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.600
Is that better?

23:14.080 --> 23:15.760
I don't know.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.120
It's worse.
It's so much worse.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.320
You son of a...

23:19.440 --> 23:20.440
Hey!

23:20.560 --> 23:22.040
ROCKET: I've had it with you!
QUILL: No! Back up!

23:22.120 --> 23:23.920
NEBULA: Someone followed you
through the jump point.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.120
Set me free,
you'll need my help.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.440
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.520
You are a fool if
you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.880
You'll attack me
the moment I let you go.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.040
No, I won't.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.640
You'd think
an evil supervillain

23:35.800 --> 23:37.280
would learn how
to properly lie.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.600
I bet it's the
one-inch man.

24:11.440 --> 24:15.240
After all these years,
I've found you.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.680
And who the hell
are you?

24:18.480 --> 24:21.680
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.080
My name is Ego...

24:26.520 --> 24:28.000
and I'm your dad, Peter.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.840
You know what they say...

24:46.040 --> 24:49.040
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

25:15.680 --> 25:17.120
TULLK: Yondu!

25:17.880 --> 25:19.880
Come on down!

25:31.520 --> 25:33.680
STAKAR: After going around
years in circles...

25:33.880 --> 25:35.680
with this woman
I end up marrying.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.520
I said,
"Aleta, I love you, girl...

25:38.720 --> 25:40.080
"but you're losing your mind!"

25:40.240 --> 25:42.240
Then again,
she's always been that way.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.160
I could never trust her.
You know?

25:44.320 --> 25:45.440
Stakar.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.400
It's been some time.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.360
It seems like
this establishment

25:57.480 --> 25:59.440
is the wrong kind
of disreputable.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.560
Sir!
Stakar!

26:06.600 --> 26:08.960
STAKAR: There's a hundred
Ravager factions.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.160
You lost the business
of 99 of them by serving one.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.880
Please, sir. Please!

26:14.040 --> 26:15.400
Get away from me.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.520
You can go to hell then!

26:23.720 --> 26:25.960
I don't give a damn
what you think of me!

26:26.280 --> 26:28.080
So what are you
following us for?

26:28.240 --> 26:29.680
Because you're gonna listen
to what I gotta say!

26:29.760 --> 26:31.200
I don't gotta
listen to nothing!

26:31.280 --> 26:32.560
You betrayed the code!

26:32.720 --> 26:34.560
Ravagers don't deal
in kids.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.640
I told you before!
I didn't know
what was going on!

26:37.720 --> 26:38.720
You didn't know because

26:38.800 --> 26:40.400
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.640
I demand a seat
at the table!

26:42.680 --> 26:44.880
I wear these flames,
same as you.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.040
You may dress like us...

26:47.200 --> 26:48.400
but you'll never hear
the Horns of Freedom

26:48.480 --> 26:49.680
when you die, Yondu.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.720
And the Colors of Ogord...

26:51.920 --> 26:55.320
will never flash
over your grave.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.880
If you think...

26:59.080 --> 27:02.240
I take pleasure
in exiling you...

27:04.000 --> 27:05.760
you're wrong.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.840
You broke all our hearts.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.760
Ah, pathetic.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.920
First, Quill betrays us...

27:30.080 --> 27:33.360
and Yondu just
lets him go scot-free.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.640
We followed him
because he was the one...

27:36.800 --> 27:39.320
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed
to be done.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.840
Seems he's goin' soft.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.800
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering?

27:45.360 --> 27:47.200
You know I'm right,
Kraglin.

27:47.360 --> 27:51.760
You best be very careful
what you say
about our captain.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.480
RAVAGER: Who the hell is that?

28:33.560 --> 28:35.240
Yondu Udonta...

28:35.840 --> 28:38.080
I have a proposition for you.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.720
EGO: I hired Yondu
to pick you up...

28:40.880 --> 28:42.920
when your mother passed away.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.920
But instead of
returning you...

28:45.120 --> 28:46.840
Yondu kept you.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.720
I have no clue as to why.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.200
Well, I'll tell you why.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.760
Because I was
a skinny little kid

28:53.840 --> 28:55.480
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.040
It made it
easier for thievin'.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.480
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.600
DRAX: I thought
Yondu was your father.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.960
What? We've been together
this whole time...

29:05.000 --> 29:07.800
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

29:07.960 --> 29:09.280
You look exactly alike.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.000
One's blue!

29:12.640 --> 29:14.400
No, he's not my father!

29:14.480 --> 29:16.920
Yondu was the guy
who abducted me...

29:17.080 --> 29:18.960
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

29:19.040 --> 29:21.080
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.640
Eat you?
Yeah.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.800
Oh, that son of a bitch.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.400
How'd you locate us now?

29:27.120 --> 29:30.200
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge
of what's known...

29:30.280 --> 29:32.800
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.200
What say we head
out there right now?

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
Your associates are welcome.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.640
Even that triangle-faced
monkey there.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.120
I promise you...

29:40.640 --> 29:42.640
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.560
And there...

29:45.040 --> 29:48.840
I can explain your
very special heritage.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.880
Finally get to be...

29:52.040 --> 29:54.760
the father I've
always wanted to be.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.720
Excuse me.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.600
I've gotta take a whiz.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.600
I'm not buying it.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.400
Let's go take a walk.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.640
I am Mantis.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.920
What are you doing?

30:25.080 --> 30:26.480
Smiling.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.880
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.960
Not if you do it
like that.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.200
Oh...

30:34.600 --> 30:37.200
I was raised alone
on Ego's planet.

30:37.360 --> 30:42.120
I do not understand
the intricacies of
social interaction.

30:44.440 --> 30:48.040
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.920
Yes.

31:01.200 --> 31:05.000
That is called
a practical joke!

31:08.160 --> 31:10.240
I liked it very much!

31:10.400 --> 31:12.080
I just made it up!

31:14.960 --> 31:15.960
QUILL: Give me a break!

31:16.760 --> 31:17.760
After all this time,

31:17.840 --> 31:19.240
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...

31:19.320 --> 31:21.160
you wanna be my dad?
GAMORA: I hear you.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.440
QUILL: And by the way,
this could be a trap.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.120
The Kree purists,
the Ravagers...

31:25.200 --> 31:26.960
they all want us dead.
I know, but...

31:27.040 --> 31:28.080
But what?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.720
What was that
story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

31:30.760 --> 31:31.760
Who?

31:31.880 --> 31:33.200
He owned a magic boat?

31:35.120 --> 31:36.360
David Hasselhoff?

31:36.440 --> 31:37.440
Right.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.720
Not a magic boat.
A talking car.

31:39.760 --> 31:40.800
Why did he talk again?

31:41.000 --> 31:44.440
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.200
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

31:47.360 --> 31:49.160
and you would tell
all the other children...

31:49.240 --> 31:51.440
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.160
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with
his band in Germany.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.440
I told you that
when I was drunk.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.680
Why are you
bringing that up now?

31:56.760 --> 31:57.840
I love that story.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.960
I hate that story.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.600
It's so sad!

32:02.320 --> 32:04.560
As a kid, I used to
see all the other kids

32:04.640 --> 32:06.760
off playing catch
with their dad.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.600
And I wanted that,
more than anything
in the world!

32:10.320 --> 32:12.000
That's my point, Peter.

32:12.840 --> 32:15.760
What if this man
is your Hasselhoff?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.680
If he ends up
being evil...

32:22.120 --> 32:23.720
we will just kill him.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.280
You're leaving me
with that fox?

32:33.440 --> 32:34.640
GAMORA: He's not a fox.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.640
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.000
Or if you feel like it.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.200
ROCKET: Okay.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.800
It'll be just
a couple of days.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.760
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished
fixing the ship.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.840
DRAX:
What if the Sovereign come?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.160
QUILL: There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.840
I'm uncertain
about parting ways.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.600
God, you're like
an old woman.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.480
Because I'm wise?

33:00.400 --> 33:02.360
GAMORA: Why do you have
so much luggage?

33:02.520 --> 33:04.680
DRAX: I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.440
I hope Daddy
isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.240
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

33:17.040 --> 33:19.120
Because it's working.

33:22.480 --> 33:27.760
You will never love me again

33:31.200 --> 33:34.040
never break the chain

33:44.640 --> 33:46.680
never break the chain

33:56.160 --> 33:59.720
break the chain

34:06.560 --> 34:08.520
QUILL: Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

34:08.680 --> 34:09.680
Oh...

34:10.400 --> 34:12.800
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.720
Your antennae,
what are they for?

34:15.320 --> 34:16.440
Their purpose?

34:16.480 --> 34:18.440
Yes. Quill and I
have a bet.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.720
Dude. You're not
supposed to say that!

34:21.640 --> 34:22.760
I say...

34:22.920 --> 34:25.360
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

34:25.440 --> 34:28.280
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from
being decapitated.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.600
QUILL: Right. And if it's
anything other than...

34:30.640 --> 34:34.200
you specifically
not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.800
They are not for
feeling doorways.

34:38.720 --> 34:39.760
I think...

34:39.920 --> 34:42.680
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.280
What are those?

34:44.360 --> 34:47.920
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.720
You read minds?
No.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.080
Telepaths know thoughts.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.760
Empaths feel feelings.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Emotions.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.680
May I?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.320
All right.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.040
You feel love.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.120
Yeah. I guess
I feel a general,

35:18.240 --> 35:19.680
unselfish love for
just about everybody.

35:19.800 --> 35:20.920
No!

35:21.080 --> 35:23.080
Romantic, sexual love.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.560
No, I don't.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.400
For her!
No!

35:29.760 --> 35:30.960
QUILL: Okay.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.080
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

35:36.240 --> 35:38.560
Dude, I think you're
overreacting a little bit!

35:38.720 --> 35:40.160
You must be so embarrassed!

35:43.960 --> 35:45.840
Do me! Do me!

35:51.120 --> 35:54.120
I have never felt
such humor!

35:57.600 --> 35:59.680
So unbelievably uncool.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.400
Oh, Quill.

36:04.760 --> 36:08.800
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel
is a broken jaw.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.840
I can also alter
emotions to some extent.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.000
QUILL: Yeah, like what?

36:19.760 --> 36:22.880
If I touch someone
who is sad...

36:23.040 --> 36:25.800
I can ease them
into contentment
for a short while.

36:25.960 --> 36:29.760
I can make
a stubborn person compliant.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.000
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

36:33.160 --> 36:37.040
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.400
Do one of those on me.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.640
Sleep.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.960
ROCKET: I love this song.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.720
Huh?

38:12.720 --> 38:14.080
There!

38:25.640 --> 38:26.640
Ah...

39:34.360 --> 39:36.920
Ain't so tough now
without all your toys...

39:41.240 --> 39:42.320
RETCH: Move!

39:59.120 --> 40:00.280
Crap.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.160
Hey there, rat!

40:07.320 --> 40:09.800
How's it going,
you blue idiot?

40:10.200 --> 40:12.280
Not so bad.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.800
We got ourselves
a pretty good
little gig here.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.800
This golden gal
with quite a high
opinion of herself...

40:17.960 --> 40:21.880
has offered us
a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...

40:22.040 --> 40:23.040
because she wants

40:23.120 --> 40:24.760
to kill y'all.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.040
Your friend...

40:26.200 --> 40:27.800
There's too many of them.

40:27.960 --> 40:31.200
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

40:31.400 --> 40:34.160
you need to get me
out of these bonds.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.560
They are going to kill him!

40:36.720 --> 40:38.840
YONDU: I tell you,
it was pretty
easy to find you.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.960
I put a tracer on
your ship back there...

40:41.160 --> 40:42.520
during the war over Xandar.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.400
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

40:45.480 --> 40:47.480
and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.720
Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.480
Otherwise,
I'd actually hand you over.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.040
Otherwise, you'd what?

40:56.160 --> 40:57.480
We'll take them batteries.

40:57.680 --> 41:01.240
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on
the open market?

41:01.440 --> 41:03.760
That Priestess
offered us a million.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.600
A quarter is only
one third of that!

41:06.760 --> 41:08.000
A quarter ain't a third.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.880
A quarter is 25.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.080
No.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.600
GEF: We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.680
YONDU: Enough!

41:14.760 --> 41:17.240
The point is,
we ain't stupid enough

41:17.320 --> 41:19.680
to help kill
the Guardians of the Galaxy!

41:20.120 --> 41:22.560
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.680
KRAGLIN: That ain't right!

41:25.400 --> 41:28.520
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.960
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

41:31.120 --> 41:33.960
you protect him
like none of the
rest of us much matter!

41:34.120 --> 41:35.200
ALL: Yeah!

41:35.280 --> 41:36.800
I'm the one what
sticks up for you!

41:36.880 --> 41:37.920
Take it easy, Kraglin.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.600
Damn straight, lad.
He's gone soft.

41:40.760 --> 41:43.880
Suppose it's time
for a change in leadership.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.160
Put your damn guns down!

41:51.360 --> 41:52.560
Whoa! Whoa!

41:52.720 --> 41:56.240
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this,
fellas.

41:56.400 --> 41:59.240
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.960
Well, hello, boys.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.360
It's not ripe.

43:11.960 --> 43:15.440
Welcome, everyone,
to my world.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.080
QUILL: Wow.
You have your own planet?

43:18.160 --> 43:21.960
Come on.
No larger than
your Earth's Moon.

43:22.160 --> 43:23.640
Humility.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.200
I like it.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.040
I, too,
am extraordinarily humble.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.440
You own a planet
and can destroy

44:12.520 --> 44:14.520
two dozen spaceships
without a suit.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.000
What are you exactly?

44:18.160 --> 44:21.480
I'm what's called
a Celestial, sweetheart.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.320
A Celestial, like a god?

44:26.480 --> 44:28.880
Mmm, small "g," son.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.880
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

44:43.400 --> 44:44.400
QUILL: Whoa!

44:46.400 --> 44:49.720
I don't know where
I came from exactly.

44:49.880 --> 44:51.920
First thing I remember
is flickering...

44:52.440 --> 44:54.360
adrift in
the cosmos utterly...

44:55.280 --> 44:57.880
and entirely alone.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.800
Over millions of years...

45:00.960 --> 45:04.520
I learned to control
the molecules around me.

45:04.880 --> 45:08.040
I grew smarter and stronger.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.920
And I continued
building from there...

45:13.080 --> 45:15.200
layer by layer...

45:15.360 --> 45:17.960
the very planet
you walk on now.

45:18.120 --> 45:19.440
Whoa.

45:20.080 --> 45:21.320
But I wanted more.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.080
I desired...

45:24.600 --> 45:25.760
meaning.

45:26.920 --> 45:30.880
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...

45:31.080 --> 45:33.800
"besides just me," I thought.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
And so, I set myself
the task of finding it.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.760
I created...

45:39.960 --> 45:43.600
what I imagined
biological life
to be like...

45:43.800 --> 45:47.480
down to the most
minute detail.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.040
Did you make a penis?

45:50.120 --> 45:51.320
Dude!

45:51.520 --> 45:52.680
What is wrong with you?

45:52.840 --> 45:53.840
If he is a planet,

45:53.920 --> 45:56.040
how could he make a baby
with your mother?

45:56.120 --> 45:57.120
He would smush her!

45:59.280 --> 46:01.480
I don't need to hear
how my parents...

46:02.720 --> 46:03.720
Why?

46:04.480 --> 46:06.160
My father would tell the story

46:06.160 --> 46:08.200
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.640
That's disgusting.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.320
It was beautiful.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.320
You Earthers have hang-ups.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.800
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.600
Ha! Thank you!

46:18.760 --> 46:19.960
It's not half bad.

46:20.120 --> 46:21.560
Oh.
Ugh.

46:21.760 --> 46:25.280
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

46:25.440 --> 46:27.240
and all the accompanying junk.

46:27.680 --> 46:32.320
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant
to be human...

46:32.480 --> 46:35.520
as I set out
amongst the stars...

46:36.160 --> 46:38.320
until I found...

46:38.520 --> 46:40.160
what I sought.

46:41.760 --> 46:42.920
Life.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.080
I was not alone in
the universe after all.

46:53.800 --> 46:55.640
When did you
meet my mother?

46:59.840 --> 47:01.520
Not long after.

47:07.200 --> 47:11.880
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.960
I called her my river lily.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.840
And from that love,
Peter...

47:29.400 --> 47:30.560
you.

47:37.920 --> 47:41.400
I have searched
for you for so long.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.800
And when I heard of
a man from Earth...

47:44.880 --> 47:48.560
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

47:50.360 --> 47:53.400
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.320
If you loved her,
why did you leave her?

48:18.400 --> 48:20.280
TULLK: This is mutiny!

48:21.080 --> 48:23.360
This is mutiny!

48:23.520 --> 48:26.120
This is mutiny!

48:37.880 --> 48:39.280
TULLK: You're scum!

48:42.920 --> 48:44.200
RAVAGERS: Oh!

49:14.920 --> 49:15.920
Captain!

49:16.080 --> 49:18.600
Help me! Please!

49:18.760 --> 49:20.320
Captain!

49:23.600 --> 49:25.360
You're the one
what killed those men...

49:25.840 --> 49:27.680
by leading them
down the wrong path.

49:28.600 --> 49:30.320
Because you're weak.

49:32.680 --> 49:34.280
And stupid!

49:36.320 --> 49:38.360
It's time for the Ravagers...

49:38.440 --> 49:42.280
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

49:43.040 --> 49:44.680
Taserface!

49:52.360 --> 49:56.040
I'm sorry.
Your name is...

49:56.200 --> 49:57.880
It's Taserface?

49:58.320 --> 49:59.640
That's right.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.360
Do you shoot
tasers out of your face?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.880
It's metaphorical!

50:05.040 --> 50:06.040
ALL: Yeah!

50:09.480 --> 50:10.480
For what?

50:12.840 --> 50:15.520
For it is a name
what strikes fear...

50:15.560 --> 50:18.400
into the hearts of
anyone what hears it.

50:21.040 --> 50:22.320
Okay.

50:22.880 --> 50:24.080
ROCKET: Okay...

50:24.240 --> 50:25.520
whatever you say.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.240
You shut up.

50:27.400 --> 50:28.720
You're next.

50:29.040 --> 50:33.080
Udonta, I have waited
a long time to do...

50:33.160 --> 50:34.160
What?

50:35.400 --> 50:38.280
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry!

50:38.440 --> 50:41.440
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning,
sir...

50:41.640 --> 50:42.640
looking in the mirror

50:42.720 --> 50:44.760
and then in all seriousness
saying to yourself...

50:44.800 --> 50:47.360
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?

50:50.840 --> 50:52.840
That's how
I hear you in my head!

50:54.360 --> 50:56.480
What was your second choice?

50:56.640 --> 50:57.760
Scrotum Hat?

51:00.840 --> 51:03.440
New plan.
We're killing you first.

51:04.840 --> 51:06.400
Well, dying
is certainly better

51:06.520 --> 51:08.040
than having to
live an entire life...

51:08.120 --> 51:12.040
as a moronic
shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.120
That's enough
killing for today.

51:19.080 --> 51:20.720
RAVAGER:
She's the daughter of Thanos.

51:22.960 --> 51:25.200
TASERFACE: I thought
you were the biggest
sadist in the galaxy.

51:25.280 --> 51:28.120
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

51:28.280 --> 51:31.880
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

51:32.040 --> 51:35.000
And he has
bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

51:36.680 --> 51:38.080
I assure you...

51:38.280 --> 51:41.040
I am not as easy
a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

51:41.240 --> 51:43.120
or a talking
woodland beast.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.400
I want 10% of the take...

51:48.040 --> 51:49.760
and a couple more things.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.200
KRAGLIN: We got
a whole box of hands...

51:53.360 --> 51:55.320
if that one
don't work out.
It is fine.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.720
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

51:58.800 --> 52:03.000
The Kree consider
themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

52:03.160 --> 52:06.600
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

52:06.760 --> 52:08.520
Location of Ego's
planet in the nav.

52:08.600 --> 52:10.880
We'll wire you
the 10% once we's paid.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.240
What are you gonna
do with your share?

52:14.120 --> 52:16.440
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

52:16.520 --> 52:18.360
battle one another
in training.

52:19.120 --> 52:21.400
Every time my
sister prevailed...

52:21.560 --> 52:24.880
my father would
replace a piece of me
with machinery...

52:25.040 --> 52:27.720
claiming he wanted
me to be her equal.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.680
But she won...

52:30.840 --> 52:35.680
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.680
So after I murder my sister...

52:39.840 --> 52:40.960
I will buy a warship

52:41.040 --> 52:43.040
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

52:43.200 --> 52:45.040
I will hunt
my father like a dog,

52:45.080 --> 52:46.840
and I will tear him
apart slowly...

52:47.000 --> 52:48.560
piece by piece...

52:48.600 --> 52:52.080
until he knows some semblance
of the profound
and unceasing pain...

52:52.160 --> 52:55.360
I know every single day.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.480
Yeah.

52:58.960 --> 53:00.760
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.440
Or a nice hat.

53:03.600 --> 53:06.440
Something to make
the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

53:10.280 --> 53:13.480
Anyways, happy trails.

53:21.280 --> 53:24.880
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.120
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought
she was delusional.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.280
Peter...

53:30.360 --> 53:32.240
Listen, I'd love to
believe all of this,
I really would.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.760
But you left...

53:33.840 --> 53:36.720
the most
wonderful woman ever...

53:36.880 --> 53:38.440
to die alone.

53:38.520 --> 53:41.920
I didn't want to
leave your mother, Peter.

53:42.080 --> 53:44.360
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

53:44.440 --> 53:45.800
and the light within it...

53:45.960 --> 53:47.600
this form will
wither and perish.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.800
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

53:49.880 --> 53:51.880
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

53:52.240 --> 53:54.200
I loved your mother,
Peter!

53:54.280 --> 53:56.680
I couldn't stand
to set foot on an Earth...

53:56.880 --> 53:58.120
where she wasn't living!

53:58.200 --> 53:59.760
You can't imagine
what that's like!

53:59.880 --> 54:02.280
I know exactly
what that feels like!

54:02.440 --> 54:04.160
I had to watch her die!

54:08.560 --> 54:12.760
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

54:12.840 --> 54:15.320
I've made many mistakes,
Peter.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.440
But you're not one of them.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.960
Please give me the chance
to be the father

54:22.120 --> 54:23.960
she would want me to be.

54:29.240 --> 54:34.000
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

54:34.160 --> 54:35.840
and the light within.

54:36.200 --> 54:39.400
They are a part of you,
Peter.

54:40.280 --> 54:41.960
What do you mean?

54:42.720 --> 54:44.640
Give me your hands, son.

54:45.600 --> 54:46.720
Here.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.480
Hold them like that.

54:55.360 --> 54:58.240
Now, close your eyes
and concentrate.

54:59.360 --> 55:02.480
Take your brain
to the center
of this planet.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.360
Yes!

55:08.480 --> 55:09.480
Yes!

55:09.560 --> 55:11.280
Whoa!

55:11.440 --> 55:12.840
Yes! It's okay.

55:13.040 --> 55:14.200
Just relax.
Concentrate.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.440
You can do it.
Bring it back.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.040
Yes!

55:19.640 --> 55:22.400
Yes, now shape it.

55:22.800 --> 55:24.480
Feel that energy.

55:28.640 --> 55:29.680
Yes.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.320
You're home.

55:37.840 --> 55:38.960
Peter...

56:13.480 --> 56:16.400
DRAX: How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.880
MANTIS: Ego found me
in my larva state.

56:20.040 --> 56:21.560
Orphaned on my homeworld.

56:22.480 --> 56:25.120
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

56:26.600 --> 56:27.960
So you're a pet?

56:29.200 --> 56:30.480
I suppose.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.400
People usually
want cute pets.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.800
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

56:36.960 --> 56:38.280
I am hideous?

56:38.440 --> 56:40.680
You are horrifying
to look at. Yes.

56:43.760 --> 56:44.960
But that's a good thing.

56:45.080 --> 56:46.080
Oh?

56:46.440 --> 56:48.120
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

56:48.160 --> 56:50.720
you know they love
you for who you are.

56:52.040 --> 56:54.440
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

56:55.320 --> 56:58.280
Well, then I'm
certainly grateful to be ugly.

56:59.760 --> 57:02.880
DRAX: Those pools,
they remind me of a time...

57:03.040 --> 57:06.640
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten
lakes of my homeworld.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.120
She was like you.

57:09.520 --> 57:11.040
Disgusting?

57:12.040 --> 57:13.240
Innocent.

57:46.520 --> 57:47.520
Drax?

57:49.120 --> 57:50.800
There's something
I must tell you.

57:59.240 --> 58:00.360
What's going on?

58:00.440 --> 58:02.360
This gross bug lady
is my new friend.

58:02.520 --> 58:06.000
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

58:06.320 --> 58:07.920
You're not ugly.
Drax!

58:08.080 --> 58:09.320
What are you
talking about?

58:09.480 --> 58:10.640
GAMORA: Mantis...

58:11.120 --> 58:13.240
can you show us
where we'll be staying?

58:13.760 --> 58:15.520
Why are there no other
beings on this planet?

58:15.720 --> 58:17.760
MANTIS: The planet is Ego.

58:17.920 --> 58:20.200
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

58:20.920 --> 58:22.200
And you're not a flea?

58:22.360 --> 58:24.680
I'm a flea with a purpose.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.920
I help him sleep.

58:28.080 --> 58:31.280
What were you
about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

58:36.320 --> 58:37.440
Nothing.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.240
Your quarters
are this way.

58:47.800 --> 58:51.360
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

58:53.600 --> 58:56.800
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

58:57.400 --> 58:59.440
Okay, Taserface.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.200
Hey, tell
the other guys we said...

59:02.360 --> 59:03.840
"Hi," Taserface!

59:09.000 --> 59:11.760
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

59:11.800 --> 59:13.280
No, Gef.

59:13.360 --> 59:15.040
It's too adorable to kill.

59:15.200 --> 59:17.080
Take it to the tailor.

59:18.600 --> 59:21.960
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

59:24.320 --> 59:29.120
I was a Kree battle
slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

59:31.680 --> 59:34.320
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

59:34.480 --> 59:38.960
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.880
But I was young...

59:41.840 --> 59:45.280
and greedy, and stupid.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.400
Like you stealing
those batteries.

59:48.560 --> 59:50.120
That was mostly Drax.

59:51.520 --> 59:55.040
Me and Stakar and
the other captains...

59:56.000 --> 59:58.400
we weren't so different
from you and your friends.

59:59.320 --> 1:00:01.240
The only family
I ever had.

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:04.320
When I broke the code...

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:08.240
they exiled me.

1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:11.040
This is what I deserve.

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:13.000
Slow down, drama queen.

1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:14.800
You might deserve this,
but I don't.

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.640
We gotta get outta here.

1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:19.320
Where's Quill?

1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:21.120
He went off
with his old man.

1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:24.320
Ego?
Yeah.

1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:26.640
It's a day for
dumbass names.

1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:32.160
You're smiling.
And for a second,
I got a warm feeling.

1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:35.000
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:37.480
You like a professional
asshole or what?

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:38.680
Pretty much a pro.

1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:41.560
Why didn't you
deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:43.840
He was skinny.

1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:48.400
Could fit into
places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:49.840
Uh-huh.

1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:56.520
I got an idea on
how to get outta here.

1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:59.920
But we're gonna need
your little friend.

1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:03.520
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:16.880
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.720
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:27.720
He's goddang precious!

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:41.520
YONDU: Psst!

1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:43.520
Hey, twig!

1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:45.280
Come here.

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:46.920
Come on.

1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:54.560
Aw, man...

1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:56.200
what did they do to you?

1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:01.760
Hey, you wanna help us
get outta here?

1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:05.720
There's something
I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:10.000
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:11.760
the thing I wore on my head.

1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:16.560
There's a drawer
next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:18.000
You got it?

1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.160
That's my underwears.

1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:55.480
Yeah, I was pretty
sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:57.640
You have to explain it
more careful.

1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:02.600
It's a prototype fin.

1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:10.840
That's an orloni.
It's a fin, Groot.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.680
You explain it this time.

1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:15.320
All right.

1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:17.960
YONDU: That's Vorker's eye.

1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:20.200
He takes it out
when he sleeps.

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:21.640
Go. Look again.

1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:23.160
But leave the eye here.

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:24.760
Why?

1:03:24.840 --> 1:03:26.320
He's gonna wake up
tomorrow...

1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:28.680
and he's not
gonna know...

1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:31.160
where his eye is!

1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:38.880
That's a desk.

1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:41.880
We told you
it was this big.

1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:50.040
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:52.840
with a bunch of
severed human toes.

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.720
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:03.520
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:05.040
Okay?

1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:15.440
What? No!

1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:16.880
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:18.320
That's not what I said!

1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:19.400
I am Groot.

1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:20.600
He's relieved you
don't want him to.

1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:22.120
I am Groot.
He hates hats.

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:23.240
I am Groot.

1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:24.360
On anyone, not just himself.

1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:25.440
I am Groot.

1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:27.440
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:28.560
the next minute
it's just because

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:30.000
you realize part of
that head is the hat.

1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:31.760
That's why you
don't like hats?

1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:35.240
This is an important
conversation right now?

1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:13.000
KRAGLIN: That ain't it.

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:24.280
I didn't mean
to do a mutiny.

1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:29.120
They killed all my friends.

1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:35.760
Get the third quadrant
ready for release.

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:43.320
One more thing.

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:47.640
You got any clones of Quill's
old music on the ship?

1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:32.040
Ah.

1:06:37.520 --> 1:06:39.400
He's got it!

1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:41.080
Yondu's got the fin!

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:42.200
Go!

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:24.600
Down there!

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:24.840
You maniac.

1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:29.040
The whole ship's gonna blow.

1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:40.480
Not the whole ship.

1:09:57.520 --> 1:09:58.560
Who is this?

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:03.040
I am sending you
the coordinates
for Yondu's ship.

1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:05.240
Release the quadrant!
Aye, Captain!

1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:07.920
I only ask one thing.

1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:10.080
That your High Priestess...

1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:13.840
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:16.840
Taserface!

1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:41.520
Where to, Captain?

1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:42.720
Ego.

1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:45.520
No, boy!

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:55.480
It ain't healthy
for a mammalian body

1:10:55.600 --> 1:10:57.800
to hop more than
50 jumps at a time.

1:10:57.960 --> 1:10:59.000
I know that.

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:01.600
We are about to do 700!

1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:17.560
QUILL: So I guess this could
all be mine someday.

1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:21.440
Rocket?
Rocket, are you there?

1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:30.280
What are you doing, Peter?

1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:33.960
Dance with me.

1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:35.600
I'm not going to
dance with you.

1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:37.520
This is Sam Cooke...

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:41.160
one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:12.360
Drax thinks
you're not a dancer.

1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:16.040
If you ever tell
anyone about this...

1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:17.640
I will kill you.

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:22.200
When are we gonna
do something about this
unspoken thing between us?

1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:24.320
What unspoken thing?

1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:27.400
This...

1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:30.400
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:33.240
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:34.680
but never say it
because if they do,

1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:35.920
the ratings would go down...

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.160
sort of thing.

1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:38.680
There's no unspoken thing.

1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:42.640
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:44.000
then it would be spoken...

1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:46.840
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.080
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:53.200
No, that's not what I...

1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:59.600
What we should be
discussing right now
is something about this place.

1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:01.560
It doesn't feel right.

1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:04.120
What are you talking about?

1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:05.680
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:06.960
That girl Mantis...

1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:08.360
she's afraid of something.

1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:10.840
Why are you
trying to take this
away from me?

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:12.200
I'm not trying...

1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:14.160
He's my father. He's blood.

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:16.280
You have blood on Earth
and you never
wanted to return there.

1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:18.360
Again, you made me come here!

1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:20.440
And Earth is the place
where my mother
died in front of me.

1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:23.240
No, it's because
that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:26.160
This is real!
I'm only half human,
remember?

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:27.640
That's the half
I'm worried about.

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:29.920
Oh, I get it.
You're jealous...

1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:32.480
because I'm part-god,
and you like
when I'm the weak one.

1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:35.160
You were
insufferable to begin with.

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:36.360
I haven't been
able to reach Rocket.

1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:38.000
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try
and get a signal.

1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:41.000
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:44.000
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...

1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:45.920
to open themselves
up to new possibility,

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:47.720
and the other person
is a jerk...

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:49.640
who doesn't trust anybody!

1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:51.480
It's a show
that doesn't exist.

1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:53.120
That's why
it would get zero ratings!

1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:55.560
I don't know what Cheers is!

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:58.920
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:01.680
I thought you already had.

1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:32.480
Damn it.

1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:06.720
Psychopath!

1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:18.880
Are you kidding me?

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:46.160
I win.

1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:49.000
I win.
I bested you in combat.

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:51.040
No. I saved your life.

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:53.160
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:54.240
You let me live!

1:17:54.400 --> 1:17:56.160
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:57.680
I'm not the one that just
flew across the universe

1:17:57.720 --> 1:17:59.040
just because I wanted to win.

1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:00.760
Do not tell me what I want.

1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:02.320
I don't need to
tell you what you want!

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:03.520
It's obvious!

1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:06.680
You were the one
who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:15.960
You were all I had.

1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:20.160
But you were the one
who needed to win.

1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:23.520
Thanos pulled
my eye from my head...

1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:26.280
and my brain
from my skull...

1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:29.360
and my arm from my body...

1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:33.240
because of you.

1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:55.200
You all right, son?

1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:01.280
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier
in quite a huff.

1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:05.040
It's fortuitous...

1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:06.440
you listening
to this song.

1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:08.240
You know...
Brandy?

1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:09.800
By Looking Glass?

1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:12.960
A favorite of your mom's.

1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:15.320
Yeah, it was.

1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:17.480
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:19.680
Perhaps its very greatest.

1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:20.840
Yes!

1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:24.160
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:31.160
from far away

1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:35.640
Like the child
I put in your mother...

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:37.840
or the freedom
you brought Gamora.

1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:45.840
you would be

1:19:53.160 --> 1:19:55.000
The sea
calls the sailor back.

1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:57.720
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:02.520
The sea calls upon him
as history calls
upon great men.

1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:07.200
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:09.840
Well, you may not
be mortal, but me...

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:11.280
No, Peter...

1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:13.360
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:15.880
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:18.000
I'm immortal?

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:19.560
Mmm-hmm.

1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:21.200
Really?

1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:24.200
Yes!
As long as the light exists.

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:28.520
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:31.000
like how you made
this whole planet?

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:33.520
It might take you
a few million
years of practice...

1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:35.880
before you get
really good at it.
But, yes!

1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:37.080
What!

1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:40.880
Get ready for
an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:42.160
and Heather Locklear.

1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:43.400
You can do
anything you want.

1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:44.960
I'm gonna make
some weird shit.

1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:48.240
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous
responsibility.

1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:50.880
Only we can
remake the universe.

1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:53.600
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:56.520
and lead it to
where it needs to go.

1:20:57.680 --> 1:20:58.720
How?

1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:10.720
Come with me.

1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:22.200
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:24.240
Drax! We need to talk.

1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:28.120
I'm sorry.

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:30.600
But I like a woman
with some meat
on her bones.

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:31.760
What?

1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:35.160
I tried to let you down
easily by telling you
I found you disgusting.

1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:36.760
No, that's not what I...

1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:41.720
What are you doing?

1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:44.800
I'm imagining being
with you physically.

1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:46.120
Drax...

1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:47.960
I don't like you like that.

1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:49.960
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:52.960
Hey! There's no need
to get personal.

1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:55.640
Listen! Ego's gotten
exactly what he wanted.

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:57.640
I should have
told you earlier.

1:21:57.800 --> 1:22:00.920
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:07.640
What is that?

1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:14.640
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:17.920
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:21.520
Everything is temporary.

1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:24.640
We are forever.

1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:26.240
Doesn't eternity
get boring?

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:28.680
Not if you have a purpose,
Peter...

1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:30.840
which is why you're here.

1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.240
I told you how
all those years ago...

1:22:33.320 --> 1:22:37.440
I had an unceasing
impulse to find life.

1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:41.680
But what I did not
tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:43.680
it was all so...

1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:48.000
disappointing.

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:51.840
And that is when I came...

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.680
to a profound realization.

1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:01.160
My innate desire
to seek out other life...

1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:05.840
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:09.320
Peter...

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:13.480
I have found meaning.

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:34.720
I see it.

1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:39.000
Eternity!

1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:40.840
Oh, my God.

1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:53.520
We need to
get off this planet.

1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:08.480
Oh, man.

1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:11.080
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:14.080
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:27.200
What the hell
you doing, boy?

1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:29.320
I could tell
by how you
talked about him...

1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:30.800
this Ego is bad news.

1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.600
We're here to save Quill.

1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:36.960
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:39.960
No. I don't care
about those things.

1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:42.480
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove
I'm better than him!

1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:45.400
I can lord this
over him forever.

1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:48.960
What are you
laughing at me for?

1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:54.320
You can fool yourself
and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

1:24:54.480 --> 1:24:55.760
I know who you are.

1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:58.160
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:00.520
I know everything about you.

1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.520
I know you play like
you're the meanest
and the hardest...

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.040
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:06.160
Shut up!

1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:08.480
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:11.320
and you push away
anyone who's willing
to put up with you...

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:12.800
because just
a little bit of love...

1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:16.200
reminds you how big
and empty that hole
inside you actually is.

1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:17.840
I said shut up!

1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:19.680
I know them scientists
what made you,

1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:21.440
never gave
a rat's ass about you.

1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:22.920
I'm serious, dude!

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.520
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:27.800
their own little baby,
into slavery.

1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:30.600
I know who you are, boy.

1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:32.680
Because you're me.

1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:41.320
What kind of a pair are we?

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:45.640
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:48.960
All right, okay!
Good. Wait.

1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:50.800
Fight a what?

1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:56.240
Who are you people?

1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:57.320
What is this place?

1:25:57.400 --> 1:25:58.400
Gamora, let her go!

1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:00.760
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:03.200
You are scared.

1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:09.560
I call it the Expansion.

1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:13.920
It is my purpose...

1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:17.600
and now it is yours as well.

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:20.040
It's beautiful.

1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:22.520
Over thousands of years...

1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:26.760
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...

1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:29.680
on thousands of worlds.

1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:33.600
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...

1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:35.760
To grow and spread...

1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:38.960
covering all that exists...

1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:43.280
until everything is...

1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:45.600
Me!

1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.640
What did she do to me?

1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:50.560
She already
told me everything.

1:26:50.720 --> 1:26:53.120
I only had one problem.

1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:56.880
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power

1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:58.920
for such an enterprise.

1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:01.200
But two Celestials...

1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:04.640
Well, now,
that just might do.

1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:08.760
The bodies...

1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:11.920
are his children.

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:13.640
EGO: Out of all my labors...

1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:15.960
the most beguiling was...

1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:19.560
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:22.720
I hoped the result
of such a coupling
would be enough...

1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:24.760
to power the Expansion.

1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:28.320
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:31.960
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated
him generously...

1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:35.760
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:38.560
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:41.920
But one after the other,
they failed me.

1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:45.920
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:47.320
Until you, Peter.

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:51.160
Out of all my spawn...

1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:55.400
only you carried
the connection to the light.

1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:58.640
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:01.320
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:03.800
Then we just go.
No!

1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:05.000
He's our friend.

1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:06.160
All any of you do...

1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:08.480
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:10.080
You're right.

1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:11.760
We're family.

1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:15.160
We leave no one behind.

1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:19.960
Except maybe you.

1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:21.960
Oh, my God.

1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:24.680
For the first time
in my existence...

1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:27.920
I am truly not alone!

1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:34.640
What is it, son?

1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:39.160
My friends.

1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:44.440
You see,
that's the mortal
in you, Peter.

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:45.880
Yes.

1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:49.120
We are beyond
such things.

1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:50.280
Yes.

1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:53.920
Now...
But my mother...

1:28:56.800 --> 1:28:59.120
You said you loved my mother.

1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:00.800
And that I did.

1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:04.400
My river lily
who knew all the words

1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:06.880
to every song that
came over the radio.

1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:11.400
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:14.080
And I knew if I
returned a fourth...

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:15.800
I'd never leave.

1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:18.480
The Expansion...

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:22.320
the reason for
my very existence,
would be over.

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:24.400
So, I did what I had to do.

1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:30.760
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor
in her head.

1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:36.160
What?

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:37.760
Now, all right...

1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:39.720
I know that sounds bad.

1:29:51.600 --> 1:29:55.120
Who in the hell
do you think you are?

1:29:55.280 --> 1:29:56.960
You killed my mother!

1:29:57.080 --> 1:29:58.120
I tried...

1:29:58.280 --> 1:30:00.040
so hard...

1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:01.640
to find the form...

1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:04.200
that best suited you...

1:30:04.280 --> 1:30:06.680
and this
is the thanks I get?

1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:10.960
You really need to grow up.

1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:17.280
I wanted to do
this together...

1:30:17.440 --> 1:30:19.400
but I suppose
you'll have to learn

1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:22.960
by spending
the next thousand years
as a battery!

1:30:24.560 --> 1:30:26.320
Finally! Rocket?

1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:29.200
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:32.640
We're in an old piece
of construction equipment
Yondu once used...

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.000
to slice open
the Bank of A'askavaria.

1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:35.120
Ego's unhinged.

1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:36.720
ROCKET: I know. Get ready.

1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:38.240
Drop her, Kraglin.

1:30:56.840 --> 1:30:57.960
No.

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.920
EGO:

1:31:16.360 --> 1:31:17.520
Peter...

1:31:18.320 --> 1:31:20.640
this is the sea.

1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:23.800
Oh...

1:32:03.760 --> 1:32:05.440
Hey, there, jackass!

1:32:15.760 --> 1:32:17.240
MAN: What is that thing?

1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:26.720
Out of the way,
dumber, smaller Groot!

1:32:31.440 --> 1:32:34.080
I told you
something didn't feel right.

1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:36.680
"I told you so."
Just what I need
to hear right now.

1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:38.440
Well, I came back,
didn't I?

1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:40.480
Because there's
an unspoken thing.

1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:42.600
There is no unspoken thing.

1:32:42.760 --> 1:32:44.440
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1:32:45.120 --> 1:32:46.640
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:48.000
We had it under control.

1:32:48.160 --> 1:32:50.600
We did not.
That is only an extension...

1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:52.800
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:54.320
What's Smurfette
doing here?

1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:56.320
Whatever I need to do
to get a damn ride home.

1:32:56.400 --> 1:32:57.760
She tried to murder me!

1:32:57.800 --> 1:32:59.600
I saved you,
you stupid fox!

1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:01.240
He's not a fox.

1:33:01.400 --> 1:33:02.400
I am Groot.

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:03.520
I'm not a raboon, either.

1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:04.640
I am Groot.

1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:06.280
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1:33:09.760 --> 1:33:11.160
How do we kill a Celestial?

1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:12.640
There's a center to him.

1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:14.960
His brain, his soul,
whatever it is...

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:16.320
Some sort of
protective shell.

1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:17.680
It's in the caverns...

1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:18.960
below the surface.

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:23.280
Yondu?

1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:33.000
Thrusters are out.

1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:35.360
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:37.360
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.

1:33:37.440 --> 1:33:38.640
You still reckon
that's the reason

1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:39.960
I kept you around,
you idiot?

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:41.480
That's what you told me,
you old doofus.

1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:44.320
Once I figured out
what happened to
them other kids...

1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:46.080
I wasn't just
gonna hand you over.

1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:47.800
You said you
were gonna eat me.

1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:49.360
That was being funny!

1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:51.360
Not to me!

1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:52.800
You people have issues.

1:33:52.840 --> 1:33:54.720
Of course I have issues.

1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:58.400
That's my freakin' father!

1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:00.160
Thrusters are back up.

1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:15.920
We should be going up!
QUILL: We can't!

1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:18.720
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:20.000
We have to kill him.

1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:21.040
Rocket!

1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:22.160
Got it!

1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:30.920
QUILL: Whoo-hoo!

1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:37.880
So, we're saving
the galaxy again?

1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:39.080
I guess.

1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:40.400
Awesome!

1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:44.680
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:46.440
if we're
two-time galaxy savers.

1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:49.080
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:52.120
It was just
a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:54.560
Of course,
I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:56.440
and all
the animals on the planets.

1:34:56.600 --> 1:34:57.880
And the people.

1:34:58.040 --> 1:34:59.040
Meh.

1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:03.800
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:42.480
AYESHA: Pilots...

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:44.000
release envoy units.

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:48.120
Our sensors
detect the batteries

1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:50.280
are below
the surface of the planet.

1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:53.120
Dive!

1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:11.600
Um... Captain?

1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:13.760
Captain?

1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:20.480
Tell me why Ego
wants you here?

1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:22.640
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:24.960
to help destroy the universe.

1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:27.320
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:28.680
So, could you?

1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:30.000
A little.

1:36:30.160 --> 1:36:31.320
I made a ball.

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:32.480
A ball?

1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:34.320
I thought as hard as I could.

1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:36.160
It was all that
I could come up with.

1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:37.520
You "thought"?

1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:39.680
You think when I
make this arrow fly...

1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:41.840
I use my head?

1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:54.520
Whoa.

1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:04.360
There.

1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:06.520
That's Ego's core.

1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:10.520
GAMORA:
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:12.320
I got it covered.

1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:20.040
We must hurry.

1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:22.320
It will not take
Ego long to find us.

1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:27.720
Keep it steady.

1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:36.360
We drill into the center,
we kill him!

1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:44.080
KRAGLIN: Captain?

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:45.480
What is it, Kraglin?

1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:47.600
Hey,
remember that Ayesha chick?

1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:49.960
Yeah, why?
Uh...

1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:51.240
Oh, hell!

1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:13.760
Why aren't you
firing the lasers?

1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:15.800
They blew out the generator.

1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:18.760
I think I packed
a small detonator.

1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:20.600
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:22.280
Well, we got these.

1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.960
Is that thing strong
enough to kill Ego?

1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:27.000
If it is, it'll
cause a chain reaction...

1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:28.800
throughout his
entire nervous system.

1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:29.840
Meaning what?

1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:31.680
The entire
planet will explode.

1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:33.240
We'll have to get
out of here fast.

1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:34.920
I rigged a timer.

1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:37.080
QUILL: Go!

1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:52.960
He's coming.

1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:56.160
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?

1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:58.960
When he wants.
He's too powerful.

1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:00.520
I can't!

1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:02.800
You don't have to
believe in yourself...

1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:05.640
because I believe in you.

1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:18.680
Sleep!

1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:28.040
I never thought
she'd be able to do it...

1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:30.360
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:34.360
I don't know how
long I can hold him.

1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:39.200
ROCKET: The metal's too thick.

1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:40.360
For the bomb to work,

1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:42.760
we'd actually need to place it
on Ego's core.

1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:45.200
And our fat butts
ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:46.920
QUILL: Well...

1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:51.360
That's a terrible idea.

1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:53.920
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.

1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:56.320
Unbelievable.

1:39:56.480 --> 1:39:58.840
"Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that."

1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:01.760
What a day.

1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:12.880
All right,
first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:14.280
That activates it.

1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:16.280
Then you push this button...

1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:19.520
which will give
you five minutes
to get out of there.

1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:21.040
Now, whatever you do...

1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:24.040
don't push this button...

1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:26.240
because that will set off
the bomb immediately

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:27.720
and we'll all be dead.

1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:30.360
Now, repeat back
what I just said.

1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:32.280
I am Groot.
Uh-huh.

1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:34.400
I am Groot.
That's right.

1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:35.800
I am Groot.
No!

1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:38.520
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:39.720
Try again.

1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:42.040
Hmm...

1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:44.560
I am Groot.
Mmm-hmm.

1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:46.760
I am Groot.
Uh-huh.

1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:47.920
I am Groot.

1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:49.920
No! That's exactly
what you just said!

1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:51.600
How is that even possible?

1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:53.920
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.280
Point to it.

1:40:55.440 --> 1:40:56.440
No!

1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:58.560
QUILL: Hey, you're
making him nervous!

1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:00.400
Shut up
and get me some tape!

1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:02.000
Does anybody have
any tape out there?

1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:03.760
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.840
I don't have any tape.
Let me check.

1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:09.680
Yo, Yondu... Ow!

1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:12.000
Do you have any tape?

1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:17.320
Gamora?
Do you have any tape?

1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:18.560
Tape!

1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:21.120
Never mind. Ow!

1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:24.640
Drax, do you have any tape?

1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:27.320
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:29.640
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:30.680
if you don't have any?

1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:33.440
Nobody has any tape!

1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:35.000
Not a single person
has tape?

1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:36.440
Nope!

1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:37.760
Did you ask Nebula?

1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:39.320
Yes!

1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:40.680
Are you sure?

1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:42.160
I asked Yondu...

1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:43.480
and she was
sitting next to him.

1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:44.520
I knew you were lying!

1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:46.760
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic
bomb in your bag.

1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:49.360
If anybody's gonna
have tape, it's you!

1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:53.080
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:55.640
You are wasting
a lot of time here!

1:41:58.000 --> 1:41:59.120
Whee!

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000
We're all gonna die.

1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:07.840
YONDU:
Rear thrusters are out again!

1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000
We're done for
without that generator!

1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:25.320
Guardians...

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:27.720
perhaps it will
provide you solace...

1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:30.560
that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:32.720
They will serve
as a warning...

1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:35.200
to all of those
tempted with betraying us.

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:38.520
Don't screw
with the Sovereign.

1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:43.400
This is gonna hurt.

1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:45.160
Promises, promises.

1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:56.320
Hey!

1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:09.120
No!

1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:11.840
No! No! No!

1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:18.280
QUILL: We're gonna blow!

1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:25.600
Peter! No!

1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:46.440
What?

1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:48.760
You look like Mary Poppins.

1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:50.320
Is he cool?

1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:53.800
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:56.440
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:25.840
Mantis, look out!

1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:39.600
She's just unconscious.

1:44:55.560 --> 1:44:57.160
How long until
the bomb goes off?

1:44:57.280 --> 1:44:59.720
In the unlikely event
that Groot
doesn't kill us all...

1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:01.000
about six minutes.

1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.600
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:09.760
T-minus five minutes.

1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:11.000
Aye, Captain.

1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:16.800
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:19.560
Drax, take Mantis.

1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:23.840
Ow! My nipples!

1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:33.240
Gamora!

1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:38.040
Peter!

1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:05.680
Get over it.

1:46:06.080 --> 1:46:09.920
Come now, Peter.
I know this
isn't what you want.

1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:16.400
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:51.600
EGO: Soon, Peter,
we will be all there is.

1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:55.440
So stop pissing me off!

1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:17.200
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:26.640
Go!

1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:27.320
I told you...

1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:31.440
I don't want to do this alone.

1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:35.640
You cannot deny...

1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:40.120
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:51.000
OFFICER: Everyone,
I need you to stay back!

1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:52.240
What is that?

1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:10.200
EGO: It doesn't need to
be like this, Peter.

1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:15.360
Why are you
destroying our chance?

1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.160
Stop pretending you aren't
what you are.

1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:24.040
One in billions.

1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:27.640
Trillions. Even more.

1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:34.560
What greater meaning
can life
possibly have to offer?

1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:41.200
I don't use my head
to fly the arrow, boy!

1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:43.520
I use my heart...

1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:22.560
You shouldn't
have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:36.000
never break the chain

1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.760
never break the chain

1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:00.160
break the chain

1:52:02.840 --> 1:52:05.720
Groot?
If you can hear me, hurry up!

1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:09.040
I'm not sure how long
Quill can keep him distracted!

1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:11.040
Groot, hurry!

1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:09.000
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:10.680
Get to the ship!

1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:11.880
Not without Quill!

1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.160
You need to
take care of the twig!

1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:17.240
Not without you!

1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:21.680
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:27.320
You need to give me this.

1:53:35.440 --> 1:53:36.440
Uh...

1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:40.040
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1:53:40.200 --> 1:53:42.360
I only have one of each.

1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:56.280
I am Groot.

1:53:57.040 --> 1:53:58.120
What's that?

1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:03.960
He says,
"Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:06.880
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:14.240
Bye, twig.

1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:19.800
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion
about your language.

1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:15.440
Where's Peter?

1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:18.160
Rocket, where is he?

1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:19.960
Rocket.

1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:21.640
Rocket, look at me!
Where is he?

1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:25.240
Mmm...

1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.440
No. I'm not leaving
without him.

1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:38.360
I'm sorry.

1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:42.040
I can only afford to lose
one friend today.

1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:43.600
Kraglin, go!

1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:45.440
Wait...

1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:47.760
Is Quill back?

1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:51.840
Rocket, where's Quill?

1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:56.280
Rocket, where's Quill?

1:55:57.280 --> 1:55:58.480
Rocket!

1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:00.560
Where's Quill?

1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:04.640
Where's Quill?

1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:15.040
No, we need to stop it.

1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:21.240
Stop.

1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:23.680
Stop. Listen to me!

1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:25.400
You are a god.

1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:28.200
If you kill me...

1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:31.000
you'll be just
like everybody else.

1:56:32.040 --> 1:56:33.680
What's so wrong with that?

1:56:33.840 --> 1:56:34.840
No!

1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:27.600
He may have been
your father, boy,

1:57:27.720 --> 1:57:29.200
but he wasn't your daddy.

1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:35.880
I'm sorry I didn't do
none of it right.

1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:39.280
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1:57:43.040 --> 1:57:44.320
What?

1:57:56.120 --> 1:57:57.360
Yondu, what are you doing?

1:57:57.440 --> 1:57:58.640
You can't.

1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:01.000
Yondu!

1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:08.240
No!

1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:13.720
No!

1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:16.760
Oh! Aww...

1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:19.640
No! No!

1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:22.280
Oh, no!

1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:18.600
QUILL: I told Gamora...

1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:20.600
how when I was a kid
I used to pretend

1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:22.520
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:28.040
He's a singer and
actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:31.440
Earlier, it struck me...

1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:34.680
Yondu didn't have
a talking car,

1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:36.800
but he did have
a flying arrow.

1:59:37.400 --> 1:59:39.640
He didn't have
the beautiful
voice of an angel...

1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:42.000
but he did have
the whistle of one.

1:59:42.160 --> 1:59:45.720
Both Yondu and
David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1:59:45.800 --> 1:59:48.360
and hooked up
with hot women...

1:59:48.520 --> 1:59:50.520
and fought robots.

1:59:53.200 --> 1:59:57.200
I guess David Hasselhoff
did kind of end up
being my dad after all.

1:59:57.360 --> 1:59:58.560
Only it was you, Yondu.

2:00:05.080 --> 2:00:07.000
I had a pretty cool dad.

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:12.720
What I'm trying
to say here is...

2:00:13.680 --> 2:00:18.320
sometimes that thing
you're searching
for your whole life...

2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:23.040
it's right there
by your side all along.

2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:25.000
You don't even know it.

2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:38.520
I am Groot.

2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:41.680
He did call you twig.

2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:45.440
Nebula...

2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:52.360
I was a child like you.

2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:57.360
I was concerned
with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

2:00:57.560 --> 2:01:00.520
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

2:01:00.680 --> 2:01:02.480
I'm trying
to make it right.

2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:04.120
There are little
girls like you...

2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:07.000
across the universe
who are in danger.

2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:11.280
You can stay with us
and help them.

2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:14.240
I will help them
by killing Thanos.

2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:16.440
I don't know
if that's possible.

2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:33.440
You will always be my sister.

2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:18.640
KRAGLIN: Pete!

2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:24.320
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:27.200
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:30.160
What is it?

2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:31.280
It's called a Zune.

2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:33.480
It's what
everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.

2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:34.960
It's got 300 songs on it.

2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:37.360
300 songs?

2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:43.600
Wait.

2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:51.600
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:54.120
I think Yondu would
want you to have it.

2:02:57.600 --> 2:02:58.920
Thanks...

2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:02.040
Captain.

2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:43.840
to make a change

2:03:48.680 --> 2:03:52.440
that's your fault

2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:55.520
much you have to know

2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:08.800
I am old, but I'm happy

2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:15.400
They came.

2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:24.880
What is it?

2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:28.120
I sent word to
Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:29.680
and told them what he did.

2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:35.120
It's a Ravager funeral.

2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:53.440
Yeah!

2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:55.560
Yeah!

2:05:02.920 --> 2:05:04.840
He didn't let us down
after all, Captain.

2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:07.560
No, he did not, son.

2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:10.000
He did not.

2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:20.080
Fare thee well, old friend.

2:05:22.280 --> 2:05:27.120
Yondu Udonta,
I will see you in the stars.

2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:33.160
He didn't chase them away.

2:05:33.320 --> 2:05:34.400
No.

2:05:35.440 --> 2:05:37.560
Even though
he yelled at them.

2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:39.320
And was always mean.

2:05:41.840 --> 2:05:43.960
And he stole batteries
he didn't need.

2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:51.120
Well, of course not.

2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:16.520
What?

2:06:17.200 --> 2:06:18.320
It's just...

2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:23.720
some unspoken thing.

2:06:32.800 --> 2:06:34.880
It's beautiful.

2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:37.560
It is.

2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:41.280
And so are you.

2:06:43.200 --> 2:06:44.440
On the inside.

2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:57.240
I have to go away

2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:41.720
You know, it's a shame...

2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:43.960
that it took the tragedy
of losing Yondu

2:08:44.040 --> 2:08:46.160
to bring us all
together again.

2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:49.520
But I think he'd
be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:51.240
I'm in.

2:08:51.400 --> 2:08:52.400
Dope.

2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:54.520
I miss you guys so much!

2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:55.960
Hell, yes.

2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:01.000
What say we steal some shit?

2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:22.040
High Priestess,
the Council is waiting.

2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:26.400
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.960
When they see
what I have created here...

2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:36.200
their wrath will dissipate.

2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:40.400
It's a new type of
birthing pod, ma'am?

2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:43.000
That, my child...

2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:45.120
is the next step
in our evolution.

2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:48.320
More powerful,
more beautiful...

2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:52.640
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:57.800
I think I shall call him...

2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:01.080
Adam.

2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:05.480

2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:04.400
Ugh, dude.

2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:06.880
Seriously?

2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:09.040
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

2:14:09.080 --> 2:14:10.600
I am Groot.

2:14:10.680 --> 2:14:12.720
I am not boring.
You're boring.

2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:13.760
You know what's boring?

2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:16.920
Sitting there,
playing that
mind-numbing game.

2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:20.800
What's boring is
me tripping over
your vines every day!

2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:22.440
I'm not boring!

2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:23.760
I am Groot.

2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:27.840
And now I know
how Yondu felt.

2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:05.840
HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...

2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:09.080
just remember...

2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:13.680
We. Are. Groot.

2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:18.160
Hey, fellas.

2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:20.000
Wait, where are you going?

2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:22.560
You were supposed
to be my lift home.

2:15:22.760 --> 2:15:24.360
How will I get out of here?

2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:25.880
Hey! Aw, gee...

2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:28.680
I've got so many
more stories to tell.

2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:30.080
Aw, guys.

2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:32.640
Oh, gee...
