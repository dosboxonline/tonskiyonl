00:01.001 --> 00:02.419
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor…

00:02.502 --> 00:05.171
-Can I help you?
-My name's Miles Browne. I'm your father.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.256
-Go home.
-Whoa.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.133
I think you're having a stroke.

00:08.216 --> 00:09.509
I have terminal cancer.

00:09.592 --> 00:12.053
I waited for you, and you left.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.556
[Miles] <i>I thought about you every day.</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:19.060
It's good we're not roommates anymore.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.645
'Cause I couldn't do this.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.648
Having sex doesn't make us a thing.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.024
You need to see other women.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.943
-Why? I don't really want to…
-No excuses.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.237
You wanna come back
to my place for a little more?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.239
Just sleeping with you
isn't good for me.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.782
<i>I want to give Heather a chance.</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:35.994
[water running]

00:36.077 --> 00:37.954
-Thanks for cooking.
-[Miles] Mm-hmm.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.581
And the new skillet.

00:39.664 --> 00:40.957
The chicken was delicious.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.375
What'd I tell you?

00:42.459 --> 00:44.127
Cast iron kicks ass.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.712
Wait till you sear a steak in it.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.213
You won't believe the difference.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.631
I'll definitely try it.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.716
[Miles] Mm.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.635
So, you up for a movie?

00:52.719 --> 00:56.222
Actually, I thought maybe
we could just talk.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.143
Oh. We've spent all night talking.

01:00.226 --> 01:04.272
Yeah, about our jobs,
the news, the weather,

01:04.355 --> 01:05.273
but…

01:06.483 --> 01:07.692
We, uh…

01:08.276 --> 01:10.153
We never really
talked about the past.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.572
Oh, we did.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.532
When you were in the hospital.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.909
Barely.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.746
Have you forgiven me?

01:26.711 --> 01:28.004
[sighs]

01:28.087 --> 01:29.088
I…

01:29.714 --> 01:31.257
I'd rather just watch a movie.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.384
-Claire, I don't…
-If you want to join, great.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.887
If not, let's just call it a night.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.308
Okay. Movie it is.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.352
Okay.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.985
How'd your presentation go?

01:51.069 --> 01:53.696
It was long.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.950
Didn't you do laundry yesterday?

01:57.033 --> 01:59.077
I'm not doing laundry. I'm packing.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.203
For our camping trip.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.956
We've done nothing but work
for three weeks,

02:03.039 --> 02:04.916
and neither of us feels…

02:04.999 --> 02:06.000
better.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.169
A weekend in the woods

02:08.253 --> 02:09.921
isn't going to change anything,

02:10.004 --> 02:12.090
not to mention you can't even
sleep on a couch,

02:12.173 --> 02:13.883
much less outside on the ground.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.760
I agree.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.930
It's going to be a challenge,
but that's the point.

02:19.597 --> 02:22.225
The further outside
our comfort zones we go,

02:22.308 --> 02:23.810
the more distracted we'll be.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.026
[keys rattle]

02:33.820 --> 02:35.655
[door unlocks]

02:37.824 --> 02:39.826

02:53.214 --> 02:55.675
Whoa! It's me! It's me, okay?

02:55.758 --> 02:57.135
-Don't shoot.
-Are you okay?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.178
I'm fine. Can you put
the gun down, please?

03:00.388 --> 03:02.307
I opened the door,
and the alarm went off.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.474
It's broken.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.767
Oh, thank God.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.853
-Man.
-I thought somebody, uh…

03:08.187 --> 03:09.188
Hi.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.190
Hi.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.655
It's not loaded.

03:19.824 --> 03:20.909
Yeah. Good.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.577
No. No, not good.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.747
I store this loaded always.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.498
I unloaded it.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.210
For this exact reason.
You could've killed me.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.339
And if you had been an intruder,
you could've killed me.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.299
I'm not an intruder. I'm me.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.634
Hello?

03:37.717 --> 03:39.677
You had the gun pointed right at my head.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.971
No. I was aiming center mass.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.723
My finger wasn't even on the trigger.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.476
Thank you very much for the apology.
Really appreciate it.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.810
Apology?

03:47.894 --> 03:50.480
What in the world would make you think

03:50.563 --> 03:53.733
that it was okay to unload my gun?

03:53.816 --> 03:57.153
You almost shot me center mass, okay?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.947
But by all means, don't apologize!

03:59.030 --> 04:01.032
I did not almost shoot you,

04:01.115 --> 04:03.243
and if you don't stop with the apology cr…

04:04.452 --> 04:05.662
I'm going to bed.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.789
Alone.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.920
[theme music playing]

04:22.595 --> 04:25.473
[Asher] The discoloration is
a deeper red than her last exam.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.351
[Claire] And it's warm to the touch.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.435
Ow!

04:29.519 --> 04:31.562
Sorry. How long has it been tender?

04:32.063 --> 04:34.315
Uh… About a week.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.651
Well, it's not a bruise or muscle strain.

04:36.734 --> 04:39.070
The AV malformation's growing.

04:39.153 --> 04:42.282
Which is why I've been
recommending surgery since she was five.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.200
And I've agreed every time.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.119
It's the first time there's been any pain.

04:46.202 --> 04:49.080
And the meds and the nutritional
supplements have been working.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.206
No, they haven't,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.875
and puberty will accelerate
the growth even more,

04:52.959 --> 04:55.586
which puts her at a high risk
for a spontaneous hemorrhage.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.506
Turtleneck sweaters are definitely
not the solution any longer.

04:58.589 --> 04:59.882
She needs the surgery.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.263
When?

05:05.346 --> 05:07.473
We can admit her
and start the prep right now.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.184
[Ava] Awesome.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.771
I hate turtlenecks.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.318
Your EKG's normal,
cholesterol's low,

05:18.401 --> 05:20.278
and I didn't see any concerning moles.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.113
I wear SPF 50 every day.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.157
There was one thing.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.826
I noticed that you previously
had been on antidepressants.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.619
I stopped taking those
nine months ago.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.873
They didn't help. I found an
alternative therapy that's working great.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.791
Wonderful. Cognitive behavioral therapy?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.794
Nope. [chuckles]
Uh, I'm injecting a psilocybin serum

05:36.878 --> 05:40.048
that I make from hallucinogenic mushrooms
I grow in my basement.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.260
Okay, that's, uh, crazy.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.845
You need to stop that immediately.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.931
There's tons of studies online
that show that psilocybin

05:49.015 --> 05:51.100
causes dopamine surges
that treat depression.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.102
And even more studies
that show that people

05:53.186 --> 05:54.979
who self-medicate with street drugs

05:55.063 --> 05:57.899
end up more depressed,
addicted, and sometimes even dead.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.151
I spent a year researching
mushroom cultivation

06:00.234 --> 06:02.361
and learning how
to extract the psilocybin.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.865
And most importantly, this is
the first treatment that's ever worked.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.117
I've never felt better.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.705
At least let me do some additional tests

06:12.830 --> 06:15.083
to make sure there aren't
any adverse side effects.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.167
Sure.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.086
I'm always open to new information.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.053
Good morning. How can I help you?

06:27.136 --> 06:29.097
We're here to camp at Yosemite Creek.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.349
Great. You have a reservation?

06:31.432 --> 06:32.517
Reservation?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.227
Campsites are reservation only.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.521
That's not true.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.065
There are 27 first come,
first serve campsites.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.777
There were 27 campsites at 6:00 a.m.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.863
By 6:45, they were all taken.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.157
I'm gonna need you to turn the car around.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.909
No, we need to go camping.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.120
Sir, I understand you're upset, but…

06:52.203 --> 06:54.455
No. You…
You don't understand at all why…

06:54.539 --> 06:55.706
Shaun, it's okay.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.208
We'll find another place to camp.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.501
Uh, thank you.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.086
[car engine starts]

07:06.384 --> 07:07.468
[Dr. Lim] Tighten up.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.886
Now work from the outside in.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.222
Eliminate any arterial feeders.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.477
This would be a lot easier
if they'd let me do this seven years ago.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.979
[Asher] It's not their fault.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.023
They're scared of surgery
for their 12-year-old child.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.276
[Dr. Lim] They're arrogant. And stubborn.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.154
You're quiet.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.073
[Claire] Oh. Sorry.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.951
I was actually thinking
about my own parents.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.163
Miles thinks that we should
"deal with the past"

07:35.246 --> 07:37.457
so that there's not a barrier between us.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.375
Things have been going pretty good.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.752
And why mess with success?

07:41.836 --> 07:42.920
[Asher] I agree.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.672
When it comes to parents,
some things,

07:44.755 --> 07:47.008
in fact, many things,
should just be left unsaid.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.303
[Dr. Lim] Says the guy
who doesn't have a relationship with his.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.598
Yeah. Because I said things
that should have been unsaid.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.433
[Dr. Lim] Well, I agree with Miles.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.060
It's not gonna be
an easy conversation, but…

07:58.728 --> 08:00.605
Wounds that aren't treated get worse.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.400
-[alarm beeping]
-[Asher] There's blood in her ET tube.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.444
[Claire] Must be a bleeder in the airway.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.112
[Dr. Lim] Retract the wound.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.031
[hose sucking]

08:13.618 --> 08:17.538
[Dr. Park] The research on psilocybin for
drug-resistant depression is promising.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.873
Apex of the lungs look clear.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.417
There's a big difference
between promising and proven.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.544
Not to mention a drug
made by professionals

08:23.628 --> 08:26.130
versus some guy growing
mushrooms in his basement.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.382
You're the most skeptical guy I know

08:28.466 --> 08:30.843
about alternative medicine,
but this you agree with?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.386
I'm not surprised.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.013
That Park's a total hypocrite?

08:34.096 --> 08:35.515
[Jordan] That you two disagree.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.434
You never agree on anything.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.770
I think you just…

08:41.854 --> 08:44.357
enjoy arguing with each other.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.483
[scoffs]

08:45.566 --> 08:46.651
You need to get closer.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.615
Can you focus on the left inferior lobe?

08:52.698 --> 08:53.783
Uh…

08:53.866 --> 08:55.034
[computer warbles]

08:55.117 --> 08:56.410
-What is that?
-A lesion.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.120
A fungal lesion.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.250
[indistinct conversations]

09:09.507 --> 09:11.759
This isn't camping. It's tailgating.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.052
There's trees,

09:13.135 --> 09:14.929
a place we can pitch a tent

09:15.012 --> 09:16.222
and build a fire.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.102
It smells like gasoline.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.229
Oh.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.274
I think their generator might have a leak.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.652
Just what you want
right next to a campfire.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.325
[Shaun] We have a view of the lake.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.786
It's pretty, isn't it?

09:40.079 --> 09:41.289
Yeah.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.273
We had to abort the laser surgery
due to a bleed,

10:07.356 --> 10:09.942
but she's conscious and stable now
in post-op recovery.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.778
The AVM infiltrated too deep
into the upper lobe of the lung

10:12.862 --> 10:14.155
to ablate with the laser.

10:14.238 --> 10:17.408
We'll have to go back in and remove
her collarbone for better access.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.785
Another surgery?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.537
To remove her bone?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.248
We'll put it back
after we excise the AVM.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.751
She'll have to wear a brace
until the bone heals.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.003
[Dr. Lim] Vascular malformations
are chameleons.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.297
It's hard to tell
where abnormal blood vessels end

10:31.380 --> 10:32.673
and normal ones begin.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.508
You were all a lot more confident

10:34.592 --> 10:36.218
in your assessment this morning.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.970
We want to take our daughter home.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.097
-Yeah.
-Now.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.766
I'm sorry. That's not possible.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.101
The laser surgery
caused weakening in the AVM,

10:44.185 --> 10:46.312
which means it could rebleed at any time.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.943
[exhales sharply]

10:54.195 --> 10:55.071
Okay.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.660
Okay.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.704
You're lucky. If you scheduled
your physical a week later,

11:03.788 --> 11:05.539
your liver and lungs would be failing.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.832
[exhales sharply]

11:07.416 --> 11:08.834
And after the surgery?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.462
What about my depression?

11:11.545 --> 11:14.507
You're asking if you can
continue a treatment that's killing you?

11:14.590 --> 11:15.674
[sighs]

11:16.509 --> 11:19.428
Before I started
the psilocybin injections…

11:20.137 --> 11:21.514
I was miserable.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.934
I-I couldn't sleep, I barely ate.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.438
I can't bear to face that darkness again.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.696
I don't know
if it's the psilocybin or placebo effect,

11:37.780 --> 11:40.866
or something else
neither of us understands,

11:42.368 --> 11:44.203
but if you found the light once…

11:45.996 --> 11:47.498
you can find it again.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.842
[crickets chirping]

12:05.391 --> 12:06.392
Okay.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.269
It's a nice fire.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.856
I used the Teepee method.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.741
[thunder rumbling]

12:29.665 --> 12:32.042
I'm thinking open thoracotomy
and midline laparotomy.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.753
We might be able to use
minimally invasive scope surgery

12:34.837 --> 12:38.466
to get the big lesions and attack the rest
post-operatively with anti-fungals.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.426
More like minimally effective.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.803
Better to be aggressive,
take them all out at once.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.306
That's a huge operation
with a long, painful recovery.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.765
He has a huge problem.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.185
This lesion looks like
it extends behind the liver.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.398
You're the senior surgical resident.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.026
You need to start making these calls.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.736
[Jordan] I'm not so sure about that.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.700
I'm sorry, but I question
Dr. Park's objectivity

13:04.783 --> 13:06.911
when it comes to Dr. Reznick's ideas.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.746
I don't care where an idea comes from,

13:08.829 --> 13:10.539
and I don't appreciate you
accusing me…

13:10.623 --> 13:12.583
-Not an accusation.
-What would you call it?

13:12.666 --> 13:15.503
A respectful and sincere question.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.631
What's the answer?

13:21.592 --> 13:24.011
My objective opinion is…

13:25.596 --> 13:27.431
a minimally invasive approach is best.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.476
Okay.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.978
I want it all mapped out

13:33.062 --> 13:35.814
with a 3D reconstruction simulation
before we go in there.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.399
We'll operate in the morning.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.693
[rain falling]

13:44.448 --> 13:46.075
It's actually kinda soothing.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.164
It reminds me of the dripping faucet
in our old apartment.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.707
The sound helped me fall asleep.

13:53.791 --> 13:54.792
Mm.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.419
I loved that building.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.797
It's where we had our first hug.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.965
[glass shatters]

14:01.048 --> 14:02.800
-[man 1] Oh!
-[man 2 laughs]

14:02.883 --> 14:04.718
Definitely not soothing.

14:09.848 --> 14:10.891
[grunts]

14:10.975 --> 14:12.601
These might help.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.564
You brought earplugs to a camping trip?

14:17.273 --> 14:18.691
Sometimes you snore.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.026
Thank you.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.738
[Lea] Mm.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.407
Mm.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.787
Mm.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.002
Mm! Ooh!

14:38.085 --> 14:39.086
[gasps]

14:40.421 --> 14:41.630
[inhales sharply]

14:42.590 --> 14:43.674
[sighs]

14:46.176 --> 14:47.219
That's it.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.387
I give up.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.807
I have a repair kit.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.434
I don't want to fix things, Shaun.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.810
I just want to go home.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.355
I…

15:00.608 --> 15:02.526
don't want to go home.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.322
If you want to stay
in a cold, wet, leaky tent, go ahead,

15:06.405 --> 15:07.907
but I am sleeping in the car.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.300
[sighs]

15:26.884 --> 15:27.927
Ah.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.929
29:32.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.973
Yeah. I used to do sub-25
on recovery days.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.685
Hey, you have time to grab
a quick bite before you go in?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.482
I was actually thinking, uh…

15:42.608 --> 15:44.026
Maybe we could talk.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.071
I would love that.

15:47.738 --> 15:48.822
[sighs]

15:52.451 --> 15:53.452
[Claire grunts]

15:59.291 --> 16:01.710
The last time I saw you before you left,

16:03.462 --> 16:05.756
I… I screamed at you

16:05.839 --> 16:07.758
because you missed my birthday party,

16:09.134 --> 16:11.595
and for the longest time,

16:11.679 --> 16:16.517
I thought if I could just
tell you I was sorry,

16:16.600 --> 16:17.810
that you'd come back.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.272
It wasn't you, Claire.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.358
None of it.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.651
I mean, you…

16:26.110 --> 16:27.528
were a great kid.

16:28.278 --> 16:31.115
So smart and thoughtful.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.702
How could you just disappear?

16:38.372 --> 16:40.874
Things between your mother and I
were such a mess.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.880
One night, she was having
one of her episodes,

16:48.716 --> 16:52.553
told me I was worthless.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.641
The only thing I was good for was money.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.856
I said, "Okay, if that's all you want,

17:03.939 --> 17:05.190
that's all I'mma give you."

17:05.274 --> 17:07.651
I sent her a check every month.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.862
Never saw or spoke to her again.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.575
It was mean and petty.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.202
Pathetic.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.912
We never got any money.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.541
What are you talking about?

17:22.624 --> 17:25.836
I sent monthly support
until you finished college.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.465
I worked two jobs.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.886
I took out a loan
to pay for tuition and our rent.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.520
Look… I sent more than enough for rent,

17:43.604 --> 17:45.439
for clothes, for food.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.400
She stole my money from my child.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.527
The child you totally abandoned.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.820
No. Not totally.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.031
It's not my fault
she squandered that money.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.742
It's not your fault
I grew up without a father?

17:58.285 --> 17:59.495
Without any social life

17:59.578 --> 18:02.706
because I was so busy
being a mom to my own mom?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.833
The woman that you walked out on

18:04.917 --> 18:06.418
when things stopped being fun?

18:06.502 --> 18:07.628
Okay, listen, I'm sorry.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.671
I didn't mean for this
to become an argument.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.964
No, you're not sorry.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.301
If you were, you wouldn't still be
blaming her, using her as an excuse.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.974
You took off because you were too weak

18:21.058 --> 18:23.894
to do what a father is supposed to do…

18:23.977 --> 18:26.396
To take care of me, to protect me.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.733
And now you're back when it's easy,

18:30.275 --> 18:31.693
when I don't need a father?

18:35.447 --> 18:36.949
No, you know what? Forget it.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.283
-Claire…
-Look, just don't…

18:38.367 --> 18:40.202
Don't call, don't come to the door.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.703
Just leave me alone.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.926
[sighs]

19:01.557 --> 19:03.392
[bird squawking]

19:27.875 --> 19:29.877
I thought this would be helpful.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.671
I was wrong.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.758
We can go home.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.012
Well…

19:40.888 --> 19:43.307
Why don't we do the hike
you planned first?

19:46.560 --> 19:49.188
Is that what you want?

19:50.147 --> 19:51.732
Is that what you want?

19:52.065 --> 19:52.900
Mm.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.485
I think so.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.074
Okay.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.701
New plan.

20:03.076 --> 20:06.330
Blueberry pancakes, and then hike,

20:06.413 --> 20:09.499
and then back home
to our warm and cozy and dry bed.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.925
[Dr. Lim] Divide the sternal
attachment of the SCM.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.678
[Asher] And done.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.389
[Claire] Removing the medial clavicle.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.559
[Dr. Lim] You have the talk?

20:29.645 --> 20:30.479
Yeah.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.189
I never said it would be easy.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.691
You can't excise a tumor
without some bleeding.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.194
Some tumors are inoperable.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.614
He wants to be forgiven.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.076
I… I just can't.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.329
[Asher] He doesn't deserve it.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.876
Well, it's not the kid's job to make
the parents feel good about themselves.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.546
This mat of vessels
is invading the upper lung tissue.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.257
How deep does it go on your end?

20:58.340 --> 21:00.259
[Asher] I can see underneath the apex,

21:00.342 --> 21:03.679
but can't tell what's tumor
and what's subclavian artery.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.182
We can't get this out without pulling out
the whole upper lobe of her lung.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.102
[Asher] Well, the parents
are not gonna like that.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.311
I-I'll go.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.397
They don't trust you.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.856
Well, that's not your problem.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.817
Well, it shouldn't be
the patient's either.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.444
I'll have a better chance
of getting their consent.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.127
I bought some pastries.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.337
Uh, I'm good.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.595
[sighs]

21:46.888 --> 21:49.099
I, uh… I'm sorry that I, uh…

21:49.975 --> 21:52.811
unloaded the gun without telling you.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.023
Thank you.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.318
I, uh… I appreciate that.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.530
I know that you're nervous around guns,

22:03.613 --> 22:06.950
which is all the more reason
that you should just leave mine alone.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.245
Well, maybe there's a better way
to deal with this.

22:10.329 --> 22:14.458
So, w-what if we kept
your gun in your nightstand like always,

22:14.541 --> 22:17.044
but we keep the ammunition
in another room?

22:18.128 --> 22:21.631
So your idea of a compromise
is that I agree to do

22:21.715 --> 22:24.301
what you've been doing
behind my back all along?

22:25.052 --> 22:27.429
An intruder is not gonna wait for me

22:27.512 --> 22:30.474
to collect my bullets
from the guest room closet.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.350
My house is not that big.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.518
I don't… I'm so confused.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.521
You still have to run up the stairs
and get the thing either way.

22:37.647 --> 22:40.192
Do you ever notice
that whenever we're talking

22:40.275 --> 22:44.237
about something
related to the home that we both share,

22:44.321 --> 22:48.658
that you always refer to it
as your house?

22:48.742 --> 22:49.743
I do?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.455
This isn't about gun safety.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.416
This is about your house and your rules

22:56.500 --> 22:58.376
and your wanting to control me.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.463
You don't trust me to make
decisions about my own life.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.049
I'm just trying to find a way
to make you feel safe.

23:04.132 --> 23:07.803
I-I don't need you or any other man

23:07.886 --> 23:10.305
to find a way to make me feel safe.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.026
[Lea] Oh, thank you.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.319
[Lea sighs]

23:34.538 --> 23:36.957
It's actually pretty
outside the campground.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.669
Another half-mile,
and we can see the lake.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.046
You're really cute.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.673
I want to take a picture.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.174
Go stand on that log.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.136
I'll get you from a low angle.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.388
A hero angle because you're my hero.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.681
[chuckles]

23:56.768 --> 23:57.769
Okay.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.814
Okay, a smidge to the left.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.111
-Aah! Ah!
-[gasps]

24:06.194 --> 24:07.195
Shaun!

24:08.238 --> 24:09.531
Are you okay?

24:11.449 --> 24:13.660
Oh, my God. You are not okay.

24:13.743 --> 24:16.163
[breathing heavily]

24:23.003 --> 24:24.838
[breathing heavily]

24:26.423 --> 24:29.009
Okay. On the count of three.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.302
-Mm-hmm.
-Ready?

24:30.719 --> 24:32.179
One, two…

24:32.262 --> 24:33.722
-[bones crack]
-Aah! Ah!

24:33.805 --> 24:35.891
You were supposed to wait
until I got to three!

24:35.974 --> 24:39.144
I know, but in the movies, they always
go early to catch you off guard.

24:39.227 --> 24:42.314
You don't need the element of surprise
to reduce a dislocated ankle.

24:42.397 --> 24:43.607
Okay, but did it work?

24:46.109 --> 24:46.943
Yes.

24:47.611 --> 24:48.486
You…

24:49.529 --> 24:51.573
You relocated it correctly.

24:52.991 --> 24:53.992
Damn.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.327
But…

24:56.077 --> 24:58.205
My toes are still dusky and numb.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.917
The posterior tibial artery's torn.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.170
I thought it was just pinched.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.798
If circulation isn't restored,
I'll have permanent tissue damage,

25:08.882 --> 25:11.009
maybe even have
to have my foot amputated.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.346
This is not a problem.

25:14.429 --> 25:17.349
I can run to where I can get
a cell signal and call 911.

25:17.432 --> 25:20.560
It'll take at least two hours
for you to run back to the campground.

25:20.644 --> 25:21.770
I'm faster than I look.

25:21.853 --> 25:25.023
You told me you used to skip phys-ed class
because you hated running.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.983
I can hate it and still be good at it.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.068
[Shaun] No.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.698
My pocket knife is as sharp as a scalpel.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.533
The tent repair kit has nylon thread,

25:35.617 --> 25:37.911
and you can use a fishhook
as a suturing needle.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.204
You are obviously delirious

25:39.287 --> 25:41.456
because there's no way in hell
I am doing surgery.

25:41.539 --> 25:43.166
It's not a complicated procedure.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.335
For a surgeon, which I'm not!

25:45.418 --> 25:47.504
I'll guide you step-by-step, okay?

25:47.587 --> 25:48.797
It'll just take two sutures.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.298
I've seen you hem your pants.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.550
An artery is not a pair of jeans!

25:52.634 --> 25:54.761
There's a bottle of tequila
in my backpack.

25:56.304 --> 25:59.599
You will need to sterilize the incision,
and I will need anesthesia.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.684
Shaun, I…

26:00.767 --> 26:02.185
Tequila! Stat!

26:03.353 --> 26:05.480
We thought you were certain before.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.482
I know you're scared
and this is confusing.

26:07.565 --> 26:11.361
We brought her in
with some minor inflammation.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.154
No, the inflammation was not minor.

26:15.573 --> 26:18.201
What we are proposing
would reduce her lung capacity,

26:18.285 --> 26:19.995
but she can still live a normal life.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.498
No. No, we're taking her someplace else.
We're gonna get a second opinion.

26:23.581 --> 26:26.418
We can't cut out
part of our daughter's lung.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.712
She'd never forgive us.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.005
[sighs]

26:32.340 --> 26:33.758
And maybe she shouldn't.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.888
You were wrong to refuse the surgery

26:38.972 --> 26:41.474
that Dr. Lim proposed years ago.

26:42.142 --> 26:45.770
A-Are you trying to guilt us
into agreeing with you?

26:46.646 --> 26:47.814
You are guilty.

26:48.773 --> 26:52.485
Ava is in this situation because you were
too afraid to make a tough decision,

26:52.569 --> 26:55.363
and now you are trying
to blame everyone else

26:55.447 --> 26:58.158
because you can't deal
with the guilt of having messed up.

27:02.037 --> 27:05.749
You need to stop thinking about what is
gonna make you feel like a good parent

27:05.832 --> 27:08.460
and start thinking about
what your daughter needs.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.685
Careful with that anesthesia.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.063
I need you coherent enough
to guide me through this.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.230
Don't worry.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.816
I've calculated the proper dosage.

27:31.900 --> 27:32.984
N-No.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.444
No, not like that.

27:34.527 --> 27:37.614
The scalpel goes on the left of the tray,
sponges on the right,

27:37.697 --> 27:39.491
needle driver and sutures in the middle.

27:39.574 --> 27:40.992
[Lea] Okay. Got it.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.036
Okay.

27:43.119 --> 27:45.330
And might I suggest
not barking instructions at me?

27:45.413 --> 27:46.790
I'm freaked out enough already.

27:46.873 --> 27:48.500
I'll do my best.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.586
But even with the tequila,
when you cut into my ankle,

27:51.669 --> 27:54.422
I'll be in extreme pain,
which can cause irritability.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.549
I can't do this.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.634
You have to.

27:57.717 --> 28:00.387
The worst that could happen
is you mess it up

28:00.470 --> 28:02.764
and cause permanent damage to my foot,

28:02.847 --> 28:05.350
which is exactly what will happen
if you don't do it.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.685
[sighs] Okay.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.312
Tequila. Stat.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.820
[monitor beeping]

28:16.903 --> 28:18.113
[Dr. Andrews] Suction.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.657
[Jordan] That enough?

28:21.574 --> 28:22.575
Perfect.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.828
Mediastinum's cleared.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.329
Now onto the lung lesions.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.457
[Dr. Park] I'm having
a problem maneuvering in here.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.710
There's too much peritoneal scarring
from the fungal deposits.

28:32.794 --> 28:36.589
-[Dr. Andrews] Can you cut at it sharply?
-I'm too close to the common bile duct.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.549
Need help?

28:40.385 --> 28:41.678
Morgan was right.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.433
There's no way to remove
all the lesions laparoscopically.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.562
All right, let's pull the scopes
and open him up.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.026
[Shaun breathing heavily]

28:57.861 --> 28:58.862
[Lea sighs]

29:03.908 --> 29:04.909
[grunts]

29:05.452 --> 29:06.953
Okay, the blood's pouring out.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.329
What do I do now?

29:08.413 --> 29:09.497
Okay.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.332
Okay, tighten the tourniquet

29:11.416 --> 29:13.626
and then use a sponge to clear the blood.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.048
[sighs] Okay.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.801
It's clearing up.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.180
You should be able to see…

29:25.263 --> 29:27.223
I see it. And the leaking hole.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.185
Now you just need to use
the needle driver

29:30.268 --> 29:32.103
to sew the edges together.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.105
[breathing heavily]

29:34.189 --> 29:35.273
Be careful not…

29:37.066 --> 29:38.485
Be c-careful not to what?

29:40.987 --> 29:42.071
Shaun?

29:43.573 --> 29:45.492
Put the backpack under my head.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.119
-How's that gonna help with your ankle?
-It…won't,

29:48.203 --> 29:50.830
but I'm about to lose consciousness
from blood loss,

29:50.914 --> 29:54.918
and I don't want dirt in my…

29:56.753 --> 29:57.837
Shaun?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.005
Shaun?

30:00.381 --> 30:01.382
Shaun.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.467
Shaun.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.010
Shaun.

30:08.264 --> 30:10.683
Shaun. Shaun, come on.

30:10.767 --> 30:11.935
Come on, Shaun.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.228
Shaun.

30:13.853 --> 30:14.938
Oh.

30:17.774 --> 30:18.817
Okay.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.109
[sighs]

30:21.194 --> 30:24.948
Come on, Lea. If you can hem a pant leg,
apparently you can do this.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.326
All right.

30:28.409 --> 30:29.410
Okay.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.714
[Claire] I have freed
the pleural membrane.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.633
[monitor beeping]

30:49.347 --> 30:52.433
Oh, why does blood
have to be so damn slippery?

30:57.063 --> 30:58.064
[sighs]

30:58.731 --> 31:00.567
And how am I supposed to tie a knot

31:00.650 --> 31:03.486
if I can't even grip the damn thread?

31:12.579 --> 31:14.581
There we go. There we go.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.124
Okay.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.793
Okay.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.713
Here we go.

31:23.756 --> 31:24.841
Mm.

31:34.851 --> 31:35.852
You're a woman.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.022
Um, yup.

31:40.940 --> 31:44.694
I've always considered myself
a supporter of women,

31:44.777 --> 31:47.780
you know, equal pay for equal work,

31:47.864 --> 31:49.449
the right to choose.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.951
Uh, thank you, from all of us.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.498
Debbie seems to think that I am…

31:59.709 --> 32:03.129
overbearing and, uh, controlling.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.384
[sighs]

32:12.263 --> 32:15.475
My ex was a humanities professor
and ACLU chapter head.

32:16.559 --> 32:20.521
But I made more money, and I don't think
he was conscious of this,

32:20.605 --> 32:22.732
but I do feel he was threatened by…

32:24.067 --> 32:25.526
my independence.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.488
The more insecure he got,
the more controlling he became.

32:28.571 --> 32:31.157
He had to pick
the restaurants where we ate,

32:31.240 --> 32:32.659
the movies we saw.

32:34.410 --> 32:37.163
I mean, I definitely had
my own issues, but…

32:38.831 --> 32:42.669
His need to control me was one of
the many reasons our marriage fell apart.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.349
[sighs]

33:03.272 --> 33:05.483
I can feel my toes.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.113
Are you finished?

33:12.740 --> 33:13.783
No.

33:13.866 --> 33:14.826
[sighs]

33:19.080 --> 33:20.498
Now I'm finished.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.041
[sighs]

33:26.421 --> 33:28.339
There's enough flow
to keep the tissue alive

33:28.423 --> 33:29.632
until we get to an ER.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.386
You did this with a tent repair kit?

33:33.469 --> 33:35.096
And a fishhook.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.100
She is very good at fixing things.

33:40.643 --> 33:41.644
You're lucky.

33:43.813 --> 33:44.897
Yes.

33:45.898 --> 33:46.983
I am.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.698
How do you feel?

33:54.282 --> 33:55.616
Like a gutted fish.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.037
I'm sorry. We had no choice but to open
you up to access all the lesions.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.749
But they were able to remove them all
without damaging any of the organs.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.042
You should recover fully.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.543
Physically.

34:06.085 --> 34:08.963
There are new antidepressants
you haven't tried.

34:09.338 --> 34:11.799
But I also wouldn't stop
the mushroom cultivation.

34:12.550 --> 34:13.551
Really?

34:15.470 --> 34:16.554
After all this?

34:16.637 --> 34:17.847
Cultivation.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.059
If this helped you,
it was either the placebo effect,

34:21.142 --> 34:23.978
or all the focus you put
into perfecting the process.

34:24.479 --> 34:27.398
Sometimes distraction
is the best medicine.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.333
[Murray] Hey.

34:48.544 --> 34:49.629
We are…

34:50.088 --> 34:51.089
so sorry.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.634
-[exhales sharply]
-This is our fault.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.723
It's okay.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.937
I love you.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.190
[sighs]

35:25.331 --> 35:29.168
I thought our relationship
was just a fun distraction,

35:30.753 --> 35:32.380
but when you pushed me away…

35:34.674 --> 35:36.467
I realized it was more than that.

35:38.719 --> 35:39.929
I was hurt.

35:40.555 --> 35:41.764
Resentful.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.685
Which made every interaction we had…

35:47.019 --> 35:48.104
complicated.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.315
What're you talking about?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.901
You made sure it wasn't
complicated at all.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.320
We stopped having sex,
and now we're friends.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.156
[boot zips]

35:58.239 --> 35:59.740
You know it's more than that.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.493
And it can't be.

36:02.952 --> 36:03.953
Not anymore.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.747
What does that even mean?

36:07.206 --> 36:09.625
We still work together.
We have to talk to each other.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.127
About work. That's it.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.922
We can't try to keep
some sort of friendship going.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.258
Which means no more jokes,
no more teasing,

36:17.341 --> 36:19.177
nothing that isn't totally professional.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.512
So, what? We just…

36:22.180 --> 36:24.307
act like robots around each other?

36:29.103 --> 36:30.313
I don't want that.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.566
It's boring.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.278
No.

36:38.821 --> 36:41.657
We act like we did
before we ever moved in together

36:41.741 --> 36:43.576
and let ourselves get into this…

36:45.119 --> 36:46.329
unprofessional…

36:47.205 --> 36:48.206
mess.

36:48.915 --> 36:49.999
Yeah.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.168
Pretending that what happened
didn't happen.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.461
That always works.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.048
[boot zips]

37:06.599 --> 37:08.017
[sighs]

37:18.903 --> 37:19.946
[sighs]

37:20.029 --> 37:21.656
You were a horrible father.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.742
And you can't undo the harm you did.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.163
But…

37:29.247 --> 37:30.498
I should forgive you.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.335
You deserve it.

37:35.461 --> 37:36.671
And I need it.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.633
Because I need you.

37:40.716 --> 37:42.551
[breathes shakily]

37:44.303 --> 37:48.724
So, I-I'd like to keep
spending time together…

37:50.518 --> 37:51.602
And talking.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.899
I would love that.

38:00.027 --> 38:01.112
Do you think…

38:03.698 --> 38:05.199
Think maybe we could, uh…

38:06.492 --> 38:09.328
restart everything with a…

38:11.539 --> 38:12.373
hug?

38:17.670 --> 38:19.505
[breathing shakily]

38:32.351 --> 38:33.561
[sighs]

38:42.278 --> 38:43.487
I was wrong.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.368
I convinced myself that I was right,
and I was wrong.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.206
I took…

38:54.915 --> 38:56.417
a choice away from you.

38:59.795 --> 39:04.216
And I will do everything
I can to make it right.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.221
I-I'm…

39:10.222 --> 39:11.640
I'm so sorry.

39:14.226 --> 39:17.104
You don't have to a-apologize.
Can you stop doing that?

39:27.239 --> 39:29.867
I don't think I can make this work.

39:31.160 --> 39:34.997
I have had this feeling for months.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.582
It's like a pit in my stomach,

39:36.665 --> 39:40.503
and I-I-I didn't want to…
face what it was,

39:40.586 --> 39:43.089
but when we were fighting,

39:43.172 --> 39:47.176
I just felt, like, relief,
like I had an out.

39:48.010 --> 39:50.388
You think I don't respect you.
I don't…

39:51.722 --> 39:52.765
I do.

39:52.848 --> 39:56.477
Aaron, you almost walked
out of our wedding because…

39:57.603 --> 39:59.438
I used bad grammar.

40:03.818 --> 40:04.819
That was bad.

40:04.902 --> 40:05.903
[scoffs]

40:07.571 --> 40:08.781
That was a bad moment.

40:10.950 --> 40:14.036
Marriages are made up
of moments, right?

40:14.703 --> 40:17.164
So many of our moments are… Are just…

40:17.248 --> 40:18.457
Are great.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.254
[sighs] Too many are so…

40:23.337 --> 40:24.755
Just painful.

40:24.839 --> 40:31.554

40:31.637 --> 40:32.847
This is crazy.

40:34.056 --> 40:35.057
We love each other.

40:37.643 --> 40:38.853

41:15.848 --> 41:17.057
Thank you.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.024
The rain, the drunks,

41:25.107 --> 41:27.943
the freezing cold night alone in my car,

41:28.027 --> 41:29.612
and you almost losing your foot

41:29.695 --> 41:32.323
was definitely a bit more of a distraction

41:32.406 --> 41:34.366
than I was hoping for.

41:38.245 --> 41:40.664
But I'm really glad you took me camping.

41:44.084 --> 41:45.294
