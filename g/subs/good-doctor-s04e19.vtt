[indistinct conversations]

00:05.630 --> 00:07.257
[Claire] Can you pop the trunk?

00:10.635 --> 00:11.469
Ah!

00:12.554 --> 00:14.222
[sighs] We made good time.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.057
Thank goodness,
or else we wouldn't have

00:16.141 --> 00:18.685
the full three hours
to wait before our flight.

00:18.768 --> 00:19.811
Great.

00:21.855 --> 00:22.856
All right. Thanks.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.315
[trunk shuts]

00:25.275 --> 00:26.484
All right.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.569
Oh.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.822
Starbucks is on me.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.324
No kidding. And I'm getting a cake pop.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.998
[car door shuts]

00:43.460 --> 00:44.669
Hey, Dr. Reznick.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.966
I thought this was a surgical mission.

00:50.049 --> 00:52.802
Uh, we're bring…
We're bringing some support.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.513
Morgan's gonna help
with patient selection and aftercare.

00:55.597 --> 00:56.806
Oh. That's great.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.101
Ten days, huh? [chuckles]

01:07.609 --> 01:09.110
Can't have you forgetting me.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.404
-I'll be back before you know it.
-[chuckles]

01:19.788 --> 01:21.289
Tickets, passports,

01:21.372 --> 01:24.542
travel wallet containing quetzales
and American currency.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.668
You've got 'em.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.587
I know, because I checked.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.255
You all right?

01:29.339 --> 01:30.882
Oh, it's not that heavy. I got it.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.884
That's not what I meant.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.513
[sighs] I'm okay.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.223
I think this trip will be good.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.891
Change things up.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.559
Focus on helping other people.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.563
For whatever it's worth,
if you ever need to talk,

01:45.647 --> 01:47.273
you can always call me.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.026
I'm not gonna do that.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.111
I know.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.072
We will not have any time to shop,

01:54.155 --> 01:56.699
but would you or Debbie
like anything from duty-free?

01:58.910 --> 02:01.329
Guatemala is known for its rum.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.164
We're okay. Thanks.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.167
Okay.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.756
[car door shuts]

02:12.841 --> 02:14.259
You're on this trip, too?

02:15.051 --> 02:16.469
Yeah, got inspired last night,

02:16.553 --> 02:18.680
decided to take some personal days,
go help out.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.432
And you're bringing a toilet seat?

02:23.601 --> 02:27.105
Spoken like someone who's never been
on one of these surgical missions.

[airplane engine roaring]

02:48.585 --> 02:51.004
[donkeys bray]

03:07.687 --> 03:09.314
The airline will find your bag.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.611
We'll get you some clothes
when we get situated.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.613
[scoffs]

03:28.583 --> 03:31.294
Would you like some vitamin B12
to help with exhaustion,

03:31.377 --> 03:33.129
or a motion sickness wristband?

03:33.671 --> 03:34.881
I have an extra.

03:34.964 --> 03:35.965
No, thanks.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.011
I'm glad we're here.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.639
Yes.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.308
After all the loss this year.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.895
It's just… Such an amazing way

03:48.978 --> 03:51.189
to be reminded
what we have to be grateful for.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.816
[Sapo speaking Spanish]
Careful!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.276
[tires screech]

03:57.904 --> 03:59.155
Let's see.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.408
[sheep bleating]

04:02.492 --> 04:05.203
Pardon me, sir,
could you please move your flock of sheep?

04:05.286 --> 04:07.497
My sheep don't like to be rushed.
Be patient.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.249
These people are our guests.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.750
Well, I did not invite them.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.752
[speaking Spanish]
We're doctors.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.715
It's been a long trip
and we need to get to our hotel.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.679
Doctor?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.515
You're a doctor?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.018
Of course I am.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.313
[sheep continue bleating]

04:33.898 --> 04:35.108
It's a fungus.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.152
It's… It's a fungus!

04:39.445 --> 04:40.863
[in English] It's a fungus.

[insects chirping]

04:54.085 --> 04:55.586

Thank you!

04:57.338 --> 04:58.548
Whew!

05:00.383 --> 05:01.426
Ah.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.434
-[in English] Need help with that?
-No, that's a friend thing.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.719
<i>Hola,</i> I'm Dr. Mateo Rendon.

05:44.802 --> 05:47.263
Dr. Saravia and her team
have spent several months

05:47.346 --> 05:48.473
gathering cases.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.224
From those, we selected 40.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.894
You're going to want to save them all.
You will not.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.479
We will perform 12 operations.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.606
I'm Dr. Marcus Andrews,
last-minute addition.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.899
If we could add more cases…

05:57.982 --> 06:00.860
Before I heard you joined the trip,
we were doing ten surgeries.

06:00.943 --> 06:04.197
My organization
has spent years building trust.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.408
We save 12 people here, that trust grows,

06:07.492 --> 06:10.745
more patients come to us,
more doctors volunteer.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.246
But if we lose a patient…

06:15.500 --> 06:18.503
We want surgeries we can do
but the locals couldn't.

06:18.586 --> 06:21.380
Surgeries that don't need
a lot of aftercare.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.342
Twelve patients, one alternate.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.302
Everyone else gets sent home,

06:26.385 --> 06:30.473
no matter how sick they are
or how sad their story is.

tell me what this means?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.452
Family…

07:32.535 --> 07:34.454
Your next of kin.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.165
Oh, well, nobody. Only Ignacio.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.270
[speaking Spanish] Here! Here!

08:01.355 --> 08:04.317
[in English] We need to do
an abdominal exam and ultrasound

08:04.400 --> 08:07.778
to see if there are any signs
of obstruction or strangulation.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.697
Please remove your bandage and lie back.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.200
[speaking Spanish] Lie down
and remove your bandages.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.834
How long have you had that?

08:22.293 --> 08:24.462
A year… Maybe more.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.256
[Mateo in English]
He's had it for a year, maybe longer.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.509
My neighbor told me
to go to the hospital in Xela,

08:29.592 --> 08:31.677
but I didn't have enough for the trip

08:31.761 --> 08:33.763
and I can't go a long time
without working.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.390
I'm the only one
who takes care of my sisters.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.267
He was told to go to the hospital,

08:38.351 --> 08:40.686
but he couldn't afford
the trip or to miss work.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.772
He's the sole provider for his siblings.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.358
[in Spanish]
Our parents died two years ago.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.861
[in English]
Their parents died two years ago.

08:53.449 --> 08:56.744
She has a large patent ductus arteriosus.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.248
I've only seen this condition in infants.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.792
The blood is reversed.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.502
It's flowing the wrong way.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.587
[monitor beeps]

09:08.673 --> 09:10.883
We could try going
through the femoral vein,

09:10.967 --> 09:12.802
do a percutaneous device closure.

09:13.427 --> 09:16.973
She has irreversible
pulmonary hypertension.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.517
It would have been simple
to treat as an infant,

09:19.600 --> 09:25.022
but now closing the hole will…
Will… Kill her.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.697
[speaking Spanish]
Aime's condition is much too advanced.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.576
There's nothing we can do.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.660
[whimpers]

09:37.743 --> 09:38.869
I'm sorry.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.788
[crying]

09:41.163 --> 09:42.665
[speaking Spanish] I'm sorry.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.958
No.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.960
[crying] No.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.964
No, no.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.354
-[Karla in English] Tissue?
-Uh…

10:08.107 --> 10:09.984
I stock up before the Americans come.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.361
And the French.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.239
They are surprisingly sensitive people.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.408
I'm sorry. I know
this isn't helping anyone.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.244
-[chuckles nervously]
-Never apologize for being human.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.455
I have a strict policy against it.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.209
This week, you are not just doing surgery.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.961
You are doing miracles.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.547
You're giving people hope who had none.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.925
Except for the ones
that we send home to die.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.553
[sighs]

10:37.637 --> 10:39.138
Focus on the miracles,

10:39.221 --> 10:41.390
or else you won't be able
to help any of them.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.437
And I will have to get more tissues.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.022
[chuckles]

10:48.939 --> 10:49.940
Thank you.

Roots for the St. Louis Cardinals.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.581
Also, he has an ameloblastoma.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.667
Not a lot of baseball fans in Guatemala.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.504
You've been here before,
or do you enjoy reading Wikipedia?

11:11.587 --> 11:14.799
I did a medical mission here
during my residency.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.802
Oh, that explains "Dr. Toilet Seat."

11:19.053 --> 11:20.679
You already have a nickname.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.101
Good afternoon, Bastion.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.355
I'm Dr. Andrews.

11:29.438 --> 11:32.566
[speaking Spanish] Good afternoon,
Bastion. This is Dr. Andrews.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.528
[speaking Spanish]
Hello, Dr. Andrews.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.695
<i>Hola!</i>

11:37.988 --> 11:39.824
[in English] What is that? Let me see.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.412
[laughs] Oh.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.956
That looks like Yadi Molina.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.251
[in English] Yes! It's Yadi Molina.
St. Louis Cardinals.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.752
[Dr. Andrews] Mm-hmm.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.130
So, are you a better hitter or catcher?

12:38.466 --> 12:40.468
He has a hepatic adenoma

12:40.551 --> 12:42.011
in the right lobe of his liver.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.721
Does not appear cancerous.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.097
No. For now.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.600
The lesion is localized,
well-circumscribed,

12:47.683 --> 12:50.102
and not close to portal vein branches.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.939
[speaking Spanish] There's a tumor
in Adelmo's liver, but it's not cancer.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.026
The doctor believes they can remove it.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.777
He's a good candidate.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.740
[chuckles]

13:07.536 --> 13:09.538
[all in English] Thank you.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.873
Cheers!

13:10.956 --> 13:12.374
[laughs]

13:13.209 --> 13:16.212
[speaking Spanish] I can continue
like this for a long time.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.838
But you have a strange accent.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.591
It's not from Guatemala, or Mexican.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.676
Did you spend some time in Venezuela?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.970
In the library where I grew up,

13:25.054 --> 13:26.847
they had some tapes named,

13:26.931 --> 13:29.099
[in English]
"Speak Spanish like a Spaniard."

13:29.183 --> 13:32.561
[speaking Spanish] I listened to them
every night until they broke.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.731
[in English] Thank you. I thought you put
this kid in the "no" pile.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.233
I decided to take a closer look.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.485
See where the mass
is thinning the orbital floor

13:39.568 --> 13:41.445
and extending up near the skull base?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.489
But that's exactly what you can't do.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.950
Reconsider? Weigh issues?

13:46.951 --> 13:49.036
Let emotional and personal attachment

13:49.119 --> 13:51.038
influence treatment decisions.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.414
Chicharrones?

13:52.498 --> 13:54.291
There's no beveling or erosions.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.293
I can stay extracranial

13:56.377 --> 13:59.797
and create a bony plane
to resect the superior tumor.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.715
Did that sound
too emotional?

14:02.841 --> 14:04.843
Even if you stay out of the brain,

14:04.927 --> 14:07.972
two major arteries are involved.
He could bleed out.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.474
[upbeat Spanish music
playing over speakers]

14:11.350 --> 14:12.768
Can I get one of those, please?

14:13.519 --> 14:14.520

14:33.038 --> 14:36.876

Apply it twice a day, for ten days.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.880
Thank you, Dr. Shaun Murphy. Thank you.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.798
You're welcome.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.807
My chest hurts, and so does my arm.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.726
And sometimes, my hand feels cold,

14:53.809 --> 14:56.312
or it's as if I wasn't able
to feel it at all.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.481
[in English] It could be
angina or a blockage,

14:59.565 --> 15:01.650
which requires bypass surgery.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.361
We should do an EKG
before he goes to the cath lab…

15:05.154 --> 15:06.822
You don't have a cath lab.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.159
[speaking Spanish]
Stretch out your arm, please.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.453
Turn your head to the side.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.164
[in English]
Feel his pulse.

15:19.543 --> 15:20.794
There isn't one.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.464
[speaking Spanish]
Turn your head forward.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.887
[in English] His pulse is back.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.016
It's not a cardiac problem.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.809
He has thoracic outlet syndrome.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.605
[speaking Spanish] Dr. Saravia has just
showed me that the nerves and arteries

15:39.688 --> 15:42.483
in your neck and chest
are being compressed by your ribs.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.984
It's a very rare condition,

15:44.068 --> 15:48.113
that may cause blood clots or an embolism…

15:48.197 --> 15:50.032
[in English] He doesn't seem happy.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.368
Did I translate wrong?

15:52.451 --> 15:55.120
No. Your Spanish is perfect.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.123
But you left out
that his problem can be fixed.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.626
[speaking Spanish]
It can be remedied.

16:00.709 --> 16:01.919
[in English] Oh, okay.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.922
Okay.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.509
I am not good at communication.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.094
In two languages.

16:13.097 --> 16:18.936
[speaking Spanish] The nurse should
come momentarily.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.066
[in English] The translator
should be here soon. Um…

16:24.149 --> 16:25.526
If you want, I can translate.

16:25.609 --> 16:28.404
-You can speak English?
-We lived in the U.S. for a few years.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.572
Uh, my mother cleaned houses.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.949
I watched <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

16:32.032 --> 16:33.200
[laughs] Oh.

16:33.283 --> 16:36.495
Well, being a surgeon
is not much like that.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.708
Ms. Garza, can you show me
where you feel pain?

16:42.126 --> 16:44.545
[speaking Spanish]
Show them where it hurts you, Mom.

16:45.963 --> 16:46.839
Here.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.050
[in English] And do you have
indigestion or cramping

16:50.134 --> 16:52.761
or ever feel like you might throw up?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.889
[in Spanish] She wants to know
if you have indigestion or cramping.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.808
Do you feel like you might throw up?

17:00.102 --> 17:01.103
Sometimes.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.522
[in English] "Sometimes."

17:04.231 --> 17:06.442
But she's lying. It's always.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.113
She has fevers, too, and throws up.

17:13.615 --> 17:16.243
I need to feel your abdomen.
Can you lie on the bed for me?

17:16.326 --> 17:19.413
[speaking Spanish] She has to feel
your stomach, Mom. Lie down.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.293
[in English] Okay.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.171
[whimpers]

17:28.255 --> 17:29.089
[winces]

17:30.340 --> 17:33.010
Ms. Garza, I think you have gallstones.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.637
We will have to run some tests,

17:35.721 --> 17:37.973
but it is likely
that you will need surgery.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.064
[speaking Spanish] Mom, the doctor
believes you have gallstones.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.691
They need to do a test to be sure,

17:47.775 --> 17:50.736
but you need surgery.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.406
No, no. Not surgery.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.492
I came here for medicine.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.161
[whispering] You told me
they were gonna give me medicine.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.288
Don't be stubborn.
Do what the doctor says.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.125
[in English] If she doesn't want surgery,
why is she here?

18:06.376 --> 18:09.213
I told her you would have pills
that would help her.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.341
I told her I wouldn't eat until she came.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.678
[speaking Spanish]
I have to work.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.764
I need to take care of you.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.933
[in English] She says
she can't miss work.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.434
She needs to take care of me.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.900
I-I need you to translate accurately.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.947
My mother was very sick, too.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.034
[speaking Spanish]
Her mother also was very sick.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.453
[Claire] And she tried
to hide her pain,

18:41.537 --> 18:46.041
but children know when people are
suffering, especially their mothers.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.670
She tried to hide her pain,

18:49.753 --> 18:53.173
but kids know when people are suffering.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.677
Especially when it's their mother.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.765
[Claire] You can't take care
of your daughter

19:01.849 --> 19:03.851
if you do not take care of yourself.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.188
You can't take care of your daughter

19:08.272 --> 19:10.107
if you don't take care of yourself.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.778
[sighs]

19:20.617 --> 19:23.287
[Dr. Andrews in English]
Did you review Bastion's file?

19:23.370 --> 19:24.913
Doing a bifrontal trepanation

19:24.997 --> 19:26.415
and reconstructing the skull base

19:26.498 --> 19:28.208
could prevent brain herniation.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.002
What about risk of CSF leak?

19:30.085 --> 19:34.131
It reduces with a multilayer duraplasty
using a pericranial flap.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.383
[Dr. Lim] I say five sentences
to a patient.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.052
You say five words.
A nurse wanted me to give this to you.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.681
Because medical jargon does nothing
but scare them and waste our time.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.600
All they care about is, can we help…

19:44.683 --> 19:46.101
Yes or no?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.647
[sighs]

20:07.080 --> 20:09.583
[Dr. Reznick] Your son's
heart valves are damaged.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.628
[speaking Spanish] Your son's
heart valves are damaged.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.590
It's probably the result of
his rheumatic fever last year.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.800
[Ana speaking Spanish]
Probably as a result

20:18.884 --> 20:20.761
of the rheumatic fever he had last year.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.597
Because of his heart,

20:24.431 --> 20:26.850
we can't remove his liver tumor.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.479
I-It makes the surgery too risky.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.149
I'm very sorry.

20:37.277 --> 20:41.573
Due to his heart,
we can't remove the tumor in his liver

20:41.657 --> 20:44.076
because it makes the surgery very risky.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.621
We are very sorry.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.715
[in English] Thank you, Doctor.

21:00.884 --> 21:01.969
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

21:02.052 --> 21:05.055
W-We can't do the operation on your son.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.640
He… I'm not sure he…

21:06.723 --> 21:08.600
[speaking Spanish] But you tried.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.688
[in English]
Thank you for trying.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.481
God bless you.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.121
[speaking Spanish]
Everything's gonna be okay.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.415
Don't worry.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.959
[imperceptible]

21:48.890 --> 21:50.058
Leon Castillo.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.685
Twenty-two-year-old male.

21:51.768 --> 21:54.021
Large, non-reducible
umbilical hernia.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.856
He's the sole provider
for his siblings…

21:55.939 --> 21:57.983
No personal details. They're irrelevant.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.027
Two children's survival depends on his.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.611
Seems relevant to me.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.031
Decisions need to be
based on medical data alone.

22:04.114 --> 22:07.200
This can't turn into a contest
of whose life is more tragic.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.036
There would be too many winners.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.915
Without surgery,

22:13.999 --> 22:16.793
the hernia's at a very high risk
for strangulation.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.462
It's a fast, simple procedure,

22:18.545 --> 22:20.797
and he will almost certainly
have a full recovery.

22:20.881 --> 22:24.676
From a surgery he could survive
another 15 years without.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.512
Replacing the valve
with a bioprosthetic

22:27.596 --> 22:30.057
means he won't need
to be on blood thinners forever.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.018
But he'll need follow-up surgeries
to replace the replacement.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.687
Well, this guy's an athlete,
a football star.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.688
Is that relevant?

22:39.483 --> 22:42.152
Yes, because his underlying
cardiac health is excellent.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.737
He should make a full recovery.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.781
Unfortunately, his dental health isn't.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.076
He has cavities, which puts him
at high risk for endocarditis,

22:49.159 --> 22:51.578
which would contribute
to valve deterioration.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.663
A total abdominal colectomy

22:53.747 --> 22:56.833
offers her an 80% to 90% chance
at full recovery.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.586
Otherwise healthy,
no complicating factors.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.547
The tumor could be removed
using ultrasound-guided surgery.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.925
But she has no access
to post-op chemo and radiation.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.635
The mass is round, localized.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.054
No signs of infiltration
in the adjacent structures.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.764
Minimal chance of recurrence.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.349
If you get all of it.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.561
She just got married last week…

23:16.645 --> 23:17.646
Dr. Reznick.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.273
…which is medically relevant,
because studies have shown

23:20.357 --> 23:22.609
optimistic people
have better long-term prognosis.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.111
And she is full of hope.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.079
Uh, there's a boy.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.789
He needs blankets. Uh…

23:35.872 --> 23:38.250
-[speaking Spanish] Blankets, please?
-There.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.584
Thank you.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.503
[indistinct conversations]

23:47.425 --> 23:49.261
[baby fussing]

24:03.441 --> 24:04.651
[sighs]

24:08.155 --> 24:11.199
[Claire] The gallstones
are intermittently blocking the bile duct,

24:11.283 --> 24:14.202
which could lead to ascending cholangitis,
sepsis, and death.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.246
Her condition might respond to medication.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.790
No, it's unlikely
given how advanced her symptoms are.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.709
But she has a non-surgical option.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.460
Bastion doesn't.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.045
It's a miracle he made it to 12.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.381
Without surgery, he will not see 15.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.049
He's unable to eat solid foods.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.093
He's already showing signs
of malnutrition.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.262
Shaun's surgical plan
is very ambitious.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.806
It runs the risk
of graft failure and necrosis.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.558
You could leave this boy worse off.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.186
Meanwhile, Edna's surgery
is straightforward,

24:39.269 --> 24:41.688
and she is all
her daughter has in the world.

24:42.355 --> 24:45.859
Who a person is cannot be completely
separated from their medical care.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.485
And I'm done pretending it can be.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.492
[sighs]

24:54.576 --> 24:57.996
We've got a mom who needs a simple
procedure she might live without…

24:59.998 --> 25:04.127
Or a son whose only shot at life
is a very complicated surgery

25:04.211 --> 25:05.629
that may not work.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.527
[all gasp, chuckle]

25:35.825 --> 25:37.827
We have to focus on the miracles.

25:39.746 --> 25:40.956
[sighs]

25:42.290 --> 25:43.375
Let's go eat.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.839
Okay, so, look at the nail bed.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.634
Karla said if you see
alternating redness

25:52.717 --> 25:55.553
with the pulse, that's a sign
of aortic insufficiency.

25:56.554 --> 25:59.683
So, your heart is fine,
and your cuticles are great.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.017
I get manicures.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.520
[upbeat Spanish music
playing over speakers]

26:04.688 --> 26:05.897
Ah, you like?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.066
It's a national treasure.

26:08.775 --> 26:11.403
No. I just wanted the experience.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.031
I shouldn't have any more.
First day of surgery tomorrow.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.616
-Oh, no, I'm good.
-Mm.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.790
[Ana laughs]

26:23.873 --> 26:25.834
-Ah.
-[both laugh]

26:25.917 --> 26:27.335
You are terrible at this!

26:27.419 --> 26:29.379
I am terrible, but I look fantastic.

26:29.462 --> 26:30.588
Watch this.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.008
-[laughs]
-I'll get us another round.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.384
[laughs] Okay.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.761
[speaking Spanish]
Tequila, two, please.

26:36.845 --> 26:37.929
[Dr. Lim] Mm.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.598
[in English]
What's going on over there?

26:41.766 --> 26:43.768
Uh, I'm getting my ass kicked in darts.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.353
You're flirting.

26:46.646 --> 26:47.647
Just being nice.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.775
Well, don't be so nice
that you regret it when you get home.

26:53.903 --> 26:56.239
You have nothing to worry about.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.324
I guarantee it.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.369
All right, I'm gonna grab a cab
back to the hotel.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.329
Okay.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.586
[Ana speaking Spanish] Up, down,
to the center and to the belly.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.504
[in English] Good night, guys.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.010
[insects chirping]

27:17.927 --> 27:20.764
Uh, Hotel Provincia?

27:21.598 --> 27:22.599
Yeah.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.936
Mind if I tag along?

27:27.020 --> 27:28.688
-Big day tomorrow.
-Sure.

27:28.772 --> 27:29.981
[engine starts]

27:37.697 --> 27:39.532
[indistinct conversations]

27:43.787 --> 27:45.997
I saw you break the news
to that boy's dad.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.209
You want to talk about it?

27:59.135 --> 28:00.345
Morgan.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.891
I just wanted to know if you're okay.

28:05.558 --> 28:08.436
You don't get to ask me that anymore.
We're not friends.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.064
You drew a line.

28:11.147 --> 28:14.734
So don't ask me how I am and then pretend
to be some nice guy who cares,

28:14.818 --> 28:16.361
when you obviously don't.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.036
I-I just got a text from Karla.

I have to check her cervix.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.028
The doctor will check your cervix.

[in English] He became short of breath
and then lost consciousness.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.144
I believe his thoracic outlet syndrome

31:36.227 --> 31:38.938
caused a clot in his arm,
which went into his lungs.

31:39.022 --> 31:42.191
That would explain the drop
in blood pressure and respiratory rate.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.736
But not his elevated end tidal CO2 level.

31:44.819 --> 31:47.906
That is inconsistent
with a pulmonary embolism.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.118
What is it consistent with, Shaun?

32:06.549 --> 32:09.385
His brain.
A clot that traveled from his arm

32:09.469 --> 32:12.347
through a hole in his heart into his aorta
and up to his brain.

32:18.227 --> 32:19.228

32:19.812 --> 32:22.690
His gag reflex is only active on one side.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.401
I was right.
He has a small clot in the brain stem

32:25.485 --> 32:26.986
near the respiratory center.

32:27.737 --> 32:31.240
Well, we can surgically remove
a clot in his lung, but in his brain…

32:32.033 --> 32:33.451
We can't do that here.

32:33.534 --> 32:37.080
If we have TPA, we could break it up.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.665
TPA? No.

32:39.582 --> 32:42.210
But we have a snake venom derivative.

-None.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.513

I can do an episiotomy,

I'm probably gonna
