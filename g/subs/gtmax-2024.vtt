WEBVTT

00:22.200 --> 00:26.400
To all units. There has been
a robbery in the Porte Maillot area.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.360
All stations, confirm receipt.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.440
PS16, copy that.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.600
PS8, copy that.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.760
Three suspects riding black TMAX scooters.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.480
Heading toward
Porte de Saint-Cloud on the highway.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.120
TN51. This is TN51 Alpha.
Units 1 and 2 approaching Porte Maillot.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.080
TN51 Alpha, copy that.

01:00.600 --> 01:04.400
TN51. This is TN51 Alpha.
Priority, we have a visual on the TMAXs.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.200
To all units
in the TN51 vicinity, give way.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.680
TN51, we need backup
heading toward Porte de Saint-Cloud.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.040
Copy that. To all stations,
send backup to Porte de Versailles.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.800
Bravo, Charlie, get back.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.840
Bravo, one's going solo.
Take him on the right.

01:27.920 --> 01:28.960
Copy that. I'm on it.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.440
Bravo is down!

01:38.360 --> 01:40.720
Copy that. We're calling an ambulance.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.360
Porte d'Italie is blocked. Backup?

01:43.560 --> 01:45.400
Negative, TN51. Stop the pursuit.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.360
Fuck!

01:51.440 --> 01:54.120
They're cutting through Austerlitz.
Send backup!

01:55.120 --> 01:57.080
No backup. Stop the pursuit, Major.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.720
-Charlie, don't stop.
-I won't lose them.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.080
Charlie is down.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.240
Alpha, stop the pursuit immediately.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.160
Bastards. Charlie, are you okay?

02:36.560 --> 02:39.400
TN51 Alpha, stop the pursuit.
I repeat, stop the pursuit.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.280
No way. They're within reach.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.200
Stop the bike!

02:42.920 --> 02:44.560
TN51, report.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.600
Come in. What is going on, Major?

02:48.800 --> 02:49.640
Fuck!

02:50.080 --> 02:51.000
Come in.

02:55.720 --> 03:00.320
TN51 Alpha, Major Delvo.
Report your location now.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.040
Major Delvo, come in.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.280
Come in.

03:54.240 --> 03:59.240
…here, on the Carella racetrack.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.480
A reminder of Lautier's victory,
which was hard fought till the end.

04:05.560 --> 04:10.040
-We also had Sylvain in third position…
-Michael?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.120
Get off your phone.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.160
I need you now, not in two hours.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.760
Yeah, I'm coming.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.200
Okay.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.680
Michael Carella.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.840
The race is in 20 minutes.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.360
All right, I'm ready.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.640
The only big shot is Kevin.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.560
Damn, look at him. Such a show-off.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.560
The guy's in full Yamaha.
The team has headsets and tablets.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.920
-Hey!
-Really, it's a total--

04:46.000 --> 04:49.760
Shut up and focus.
It's the qualifying round. High level.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.320
-Dad'll kick our asses if you lose.
-Don't worry. I got this.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.560
-Triple bump?
-Third gear, full throttle.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.520
-Corner exit position?
-I lean on the bike, elbow out.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.560
-Your eyes?
-High up, I know.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.600
-Whatever happens…
-We stay alive.

05:08.120 --> 05:08.960
Okay.

05:22.800 --> 05:27.400
…GP8 on this track created
by the '90s legendary couple,

05:27.480 --> 05:31.640
and with us is the man who dominated
the podiums for 13 years

05:31.720 --> 05:33.840
in the Motocross World Championship.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.240
A great ambassador for this sport,
Mr. Daniel Carella!

05:45.240 --> 05:48.040
Thank you, Jean-Yves. Thank you, everyone,

05:48.680 --> 05:53.080
for your support
and presence on this racetrack

05:53.160 --> 05:55.720
that my wife, Clara, and I

05:55.800 --> 05:59.480
imagined and created a long time ago.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.360
It is with great emotion
that for the past two years,

06:03.440 --> 06:07.200
my family, my sister and I
have been welcoming you here.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.640
Together, let's keep Clara's legacy alive.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.480
To the next generation, I say,
"May the best rider win!"

06:18.000 --> 06:21.600
And hopefully,
the best will be a Carella today.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.840
Thank you all for your love and support.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.640
Have a great race!

06:26.720 --> 06:31.200
Thank you very much, Daniel.
Let's give him a big round of applause.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.120
This is the final qualifying race.

06:35.200 --> 06:40.520
The last showdown
we've all been waiting weeks for.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.120
And this morning, during the trials,

06:43.200 --> 06:46.920
it was Michael who finished
with the best time, racing at home today.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.400
Michael, wearing number 107,
is in second position,

06:50.480 --> 06:53.480
just behind Kevin Lautier, number 187.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.600
He's two points away
from first place and qualification.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.000
There's the green flag.
They're ready to start.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.880
This'll be explosive!

07:05.920 --> 07:06.960
Five seconds!

07:16.560 --> 07:19.160
They'll be jostling for position
at the first turn.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.040
Michael Carella is leading.

07:29.880 --> 07:34.560
Michael is going full throttle
and Lautier enters second place.

07:37.960 --> 07:38.880
…incredible!

07:38.960 --> 07:41.040
He flies away on the other side.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.080
He solidifies his position on the hill.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.280
It's crowded at the back.
Everyone is pushing.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.280
It's Michael Carella's home turf.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.160
-He has a huge advantage.
-Go, Mika!

07:56.240 --> 07:58.200
He stays in the lead!

07:58.280 --> 08:00.440
He flies away, followed by his opponent,

08:00.520 --> 08:03.400
Kevin Lautier, who's back in second place.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.760
Two more laps,

08:07.840 --> 08:11.360
and Michael has maintained his lead.
The heat is on!

08:11.920 --> 08:15.640
But it's not over yet.
Kevin Lautier is breathing down his neck.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.400
Careful, Kevin Lautier is still pushing.

08:20.480 --> 08:24.400
The pressure is on. He's right behind him,
aggressive on the bumps.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.120
And double whip!

08:26.200 --> 08:27.720
Go, Michael!

08:27.800 --> 08:29.320
Come on!

08:32.320 --> 08:33.600
He takes back the lead.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.960
Keep pushing, Mika.

08:35.040 --> 08:38.080
What an incredible line!
Michael stays in the lead,

08:38.160 --> 08:39.760
scraping through on the inside.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.200
Michael Carella stays slightly ahead.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.640
These two are fighting ruthlessly
for the world championship,

08:47.720 --> 08:49.680
while the other riders are clinging on.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.800
Oh, yes, he's coming back! Hang on.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.200
Damn, don't do this to me.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.680
…showing his front fender.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.360
Close the door, Michael,
because he's coming back.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.200
It's so intense. Anything could happen.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.040
-No…
-What a final! The heat is on!

09:08.560 --> 09:12.560
Oh, what a race!
They are coming up to the finish.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.160
Fuck…

09:14.240 --> 09:15.440
He goes for it!

09:16.000 --> 09:18.760
-He goes for it and passes him!
-Fucking hell!

09:19.760 --> 09:22.240
Since he's just lost pole position,

09:22.320 --> 09:25.640
Kevin is the big winner today,

09:25.720 --> 09:32.200
winning over Michael Carella
who finishes second.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.600
You could have won that race.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.920
You had him.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.040
I still came second.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.280
-Second place is just the first loser.
-Dad…

09:56.600 --> 09:59.800
You're talented, but talent isn't enough.
It's the bare minimum.

10:00.320 --> 10:04.000
Winning is a matter of choice and will,
you know that.

10:05.480 --> 10:09.000
-Today, you didn't have it all.
-Dad, enough. He gets it.

10:09.080 --> 10:13.040
-We'll practice. We have the whole season.
-There's no more training. It's over.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.640
What do you mean?

10:18.840 --> 10:23.120
Finish cleaning the paddocks,
and I'll see you both at home, okay?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.000
So we haven't made much progress.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.960
I almost caught them three weeks ago.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.600
But they're organized and trained.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.960
They have powerful TMAXs
with their own mods.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.760
They stole 600,000 euros of luxury watches
transported by an employee.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.120
They had an informant.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.440
You want more men
and resources to stop them.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.120
I need leverage.
I need the police to intervene on demand.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.160
I didn't have enough vehicles
to stop them. Help me.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.040
-Fuck, Vincent!
-Your watch!

11:30.640 --> 11:32.600
-Go fuck yourself!
-Give me your watch!

11:32.680 --> 11:34.120
Fucking give it to him! Now!

11:39.520 --> 11:40.480
Stay down, asshole!

11:43.240 --> 11:45.600
-So, dickhead, what do you say now?
-Vincent!

11:47.720 --> 11:49.040
Come here!

11:50.360 --> 11:51.200
Stop!

11:54.600 --> 11:57.760
-What's the holdup?
-Get back in your car!

11:57.840 --> 11:59.080
Vincent, look at me.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.600
-What are you doing?
-Call the police!

12:03.920 --> 12:04.760
Vincent!

12:05.840 --> 12:07.400
Don't move. I'll call for help.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.200
Yeah, get lost, asshole!

12:21.920 --> 12:23.320
Two colleagues in hospital.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.240
Your bike squad is costly
in terms of men and equipment.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.560
I'm a cop, not an insurance broker.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.080
My riders know the risk.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.520
These guys are after the adrenaline rush,

12:35.600 --> 12:36.720
not the money.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.080
They love making us look like idiots.
You can bet they'll do it again.

12:41.160 --> 12:45.640
It's becoming impossible to justify
your operations to the Ministry.

12:45.720 --> 12:46.600
I need results.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.080
Crystal Week.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.400
What?

12:53.920 --> 12:54.840
Elsa, please.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.640
We know they target jewelry. Watch this.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.240
As Crystal Week approaches,

13:06.320 --> 13:10.360
the highlight is the red diamond display,
the rarest of stones.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.840
Diamond dealer Mazetti
will unveil them at an auction

13:12.920 --> 13:15.160
with a confidential valuation.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.280
These diamonds--

13:17.560 --> 13:21.080
Jewelry worth millions will travel
on the A1 between Roissy, Orly,

13:21.160 --> 13:22.400
Le Bourget and Paris.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.400
They'll hit them.

13:24.160 --> 13:27.040
Anything solid or are you relying
on your instincts again?

13:30.160 --> 13:31.320
I know how they think.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.160
I've analyzed their targets and their MOs.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.840
If I were them, I wouldn't let that slide.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.840
I'm going back to my office

13:40.920 --> 13:44.360
to get chewed out
by officials and cops who want you gone.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.680
So don't ask for favors.

13:46.840 --> 13:47.720
And above all,

13:48.720 --> 13:50.240
I don't want to hear from you.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.360
Have a nice day.

14:03.120 --> 14:03.960
What now?

14:04.480 --> 14:07.320
Are the results in
from the Bir-Hakeim bridge robbery?

14:07.400 --> 14:08.600
-Not yet.
-Chase them up.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.520
Okay.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.720
…3 p.m., at the driving school
in Saint-Ouen.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.440
-How much?
-Three thousand.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.720
-Can we count on you?
-Michael?

14:29.720 --> 14:31.120
Yeah, I'll think about it.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.400
-Well, don't think too much.
-Yeah, okay.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.520
What are you and Yacine up to?

14:38.600 --> 14:41.240
He offered me a gig.
3,000 euros, easy job.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.560
-"A gig"?
-A jump Yacine can't do. He's injured.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.360
I didn't get details,
but the guy pays cash.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.120
Hey.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.600
Is it legit?

14:51.440 --> 14:52.520
Of course it is.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.200
Hurry up. Dad is waiting for us.

14:59.040 --> 14:59.880
Okay.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.320
Thanks.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.320
Thanks.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.320
Not too much.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.600
So…

15:45.400 --> 15:46.440
What's going on?

15:49.920 --> 15:53.160
We can't afford to go on.
We could've lasted another year,

15:53.240 --> 15:55.800
but with Michael's defeat,
the sponsors are bailing.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.440
There.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.600
Why didn't you say before the race?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.880
-I don't understand.
-Wait.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.000
Where do we stand?
What's the exact situation?

16:08.840 --> 16:11.440
I won't get into details,
that's my business.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.560
Tell us!

16:16.680 --> 16:18.240
150,000 euros in debt.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.320
The racetrack rental doesn't pay enough.

16:22.800 --> 16:27.680
The bank wants us to sell the house
and the racetrack immediately.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.560
She's right. They're not kids anymore.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.200
All right, don't start.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.640
You never thought
that this concerns us all?

16:36.680 --> 16:38.360
-We'll end up homeless, Dad.
-No.

16:39.640 --> 16:43.320
-It won't happen. I have a solution.
-What solution?

16:44.720 --> 16:45.720
I'll sell the bikes.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.560
The bikes?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.240
Mom's bikes?

16:59.840 --> 17:01.040
What are you saying?

17:01.560 --> 17:04.880
You and Mom spent years restoring them.
What are you saying?

17:06.200 --> 17:09.080
I asked around.
We could make 100,000 euros, at least.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.920
So…

17:14.560 --> 17:16.160
You guys would be covered.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.080
You and your brother can start over.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.600
Aunt Hélène, did you know?

17:24.160 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:27.960 --> 17:28.840
And?

17:30.200 --> 17:33.640
He won't be buried
with those bikes. They won't fit.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.200
So nobody cares?

17:40.840 --> 17:43.600
You're getting rid of Mom's bikes
and nobody cares.

17:43.680 --> 17:49.400
Honey, your mom restored those bikes
to give them life, not to collect them.

17:49.480 --> 17:53.480
-She would've agreed if she were here.
-But she's not here anymore!

17:56.560 --> 17:59.240
If you sell them,
it's like burying her a second time.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.800
Yacine offered me a jump.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.160
It pays 3,000 euros.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.720
That money can help us.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.560
I just have to win races.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.440
The race you had to win was today, okay?

18:15.200 --> 18:17.560
So you can keep
your cheap gigs for yourself.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.920
Tell the truth.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.560
What truth?

18:27.080 --> 18:28.280
What you really think.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.560
-I don't understand.
-Say it.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.760
If I'd had the accident,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.920
Michael, you're talking nonsense.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.880
Really? Go ahead, ask him.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.880
Right, Dad?
Who's a better rider? Me or Soélie?

18:45.400 --> 18:48.920
-Soélie doesn't want to ride anymore, so…
-That's not what I asked.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.120
-That's my answer.
-Who's better, me or Soélie?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.880
Just answer my question. Who's better?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.680
-Me or Soélie?
-Soélie!

18:59.720 --> 19:00.560
There.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.360
-Daniel Carella's legendary honesty!
-Hey, take it easy.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.600
-A little respect.
-That's enough.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.720
-Look where it got us!
-Watch your tone.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.640
-Look where it got us!
-Stop!

19:14.080 --> 19:15.280
You know what?

19:15.360 --> 19:17.120
If I'd had a say in Mom's cancer,

19:18.480 --> 19:20.000
I would've picked you instead.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.840
Anything to add? Now is the perfect time.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.320
Michael wants to help you.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.440
And you humiliate him.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.280
I talk to him.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.040
I've explained it.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.080
He needs to understand that.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.720
He doesn't have the mentality
or the pride to be a champion.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.320
Me neither, Dad.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.240
Sorry.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.240
You're his dad.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.320
Not just his coach.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.200
Try to remember that.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.320
-Is it here?
-I don't know.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.400
I don't see any jump set.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.960
Yes, it's here. I see Yacine.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.960
I don't trust him. Let me check first.

20:52.040 --> 20:52.960
Yeah, don't worry.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.720
The rider!

20:59.520 --> 21:00.840
-Right on time.
-How are you?

21:00.920 --> 21:02.360
How are you? Good?

21:02.440 --> 21:03.480
How are you, Soélie?

21:04.880 --> 21:05.720
Yeah.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.520
She seems good.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.400
-Is your hand better?
-Yes.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.240
-Is that your bike?
-Yes.

21:11.320 --> 21:12.600
What a monster!

21:12.680 --> 21:14.080
I'll introduce you to Théo.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.400
Théo!

21:19.600 --> 21:20.440
The rider.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.480
-Hi.
-I'm Michael.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.080
-You're a bit young.
-I'm 20.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.960
Ten years on a bike, so I'm good.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.880
Does the lady ride too?

21:30.000 --> 21:33.840
The lady is the mechanic.
She wants to check the track.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.560
The bike is all set.
There won't be any issues.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.000
I get to decide that.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.360
My brother'll jump, but on our bike.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.400
Calm down, it's more than just a jump.

21:44.040 --> 21:44.920
What do you mean?

21:46.200 --> 21:47.680
Didn't you say it was a jump?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.200
Follow me. You'll see.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.960
What about the watch guy?

22:00.040 --> 22:02.320
Yeah, he said 200, tops.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.320
No, go higher.
No, I won't accept less than 500.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.440
-Okay…
-Elyas!

22:07.240 --> 22:08.120
I have to go.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.280
This is Michael Carella.
The guy I told you about.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.120
With an unexpected sister.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.040
Hi. I'm Elyas.

22:24.120 --> 22:24.960
-Soélie.
-Hello.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.360
-Hi. I'm Michael.
-Welcome.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.600
Was this originally a scooter?

22:37.040 --> 22:38.440
Looks like a Yamaha.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.160
Yes.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.320
-A tank disguised as a dirt bike?
-Exactly.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.120
We need to test this little gem.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.240
My brother won't ride it.
It's too dangerous.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.080
-You're overreacting.
-Let's go. I'm done.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.360
Do you ride?

22:54.800 --> 22:57.280
Théo is my best mechanic.
You can trust him.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.120
I know dirt bikes.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.360
I can't see
why your tank is on a racetrack.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.320
It's an obstacle course.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.200
We need to test the speed
and the fork's resistance.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.040
My client wants a bike
that's reactive and powerful.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.560
I need a good cross rider
to push it to the max. Can you do it?

23:24.720 --> 23:26.040
-Yeah, I can do it.
-Yeah?

23:27.440 --> 23:28.400
Well?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.480
-Did you convert the TMAX?
-Yes.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.600
Nice job. Very clean.
It's still an assault tank though.

23:38.800 --> 23:39.640
Elaborate.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.000
The torque is too weak.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.480
It needs remapping for maximum RPM

23:44.560 --> 23:46.600
and the fork needs a firmer setting.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.600
The variator compensates. I tested it.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.920
The range won't keep up. It'll lack power.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.280
Especially on an obstacle course.
And your hoses are crap.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.400
Are you sure?

24:00.960 --> 24:02.920
So, do you want to test it?

24:10.040 --> 24:10.880
Okay.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.760
-All good?
-Do you trust this guy?

24:15.840 --> 24:17.560
Okay. Are you comfortable?

24:17.640 --> 24:19.080
Totally. He's my pal, a pro.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.120
-I'm good.
-Watch carefully…

24:21.200 --> 24:22.680
What did you tell him?

24:22.760 --> 24:26.360
Nothing. He's here to test the bike,
get paid and that's it.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.280
How's your arm?

24:29.360 --> 24:31.760
-This isn't the track at home.
-I'll be careful.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.760
Good. It'll be better tomorrow.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.240
-Keep an eye on me all the time.
-I know. Don't worry. I'll manage.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.360
Watch me.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.120
-You didn't do anything stupid?
-Is this an interrogation?

24:41.640 --> 24:42.720
Don't you trust me?

24:43.280 --> 24:44.120
Chill out, bro.

24:44.640 --> 24:45.480
Are you sure?

24:46.840 --> 24:48.760
Yes, I'm sure. You're pissing me off.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.600
-Yacine.
-What?

24:52.120 --> 24:53.400
I hope so. For your sake.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.400
Did you see the fork?
It's a piece of wood.

25:00.480 --> 25:01.960
It's okay. You'll make do.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.920
Check the surroundings…

25:04.000 --> 25:04.920
All good?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.680
-Check the brakes at the start.
-Yeah, don't worry.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.440
-Okay.
-Whatever happens…

25:09.520 --> 25:10.920
We stay alive. I know.

25:11.000 --> 25:11.840
Go, little bro.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.160
Okay, he's ready.

25:17.320 --> 25:18.200
Okay, you can go.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.200
There's no power!

25:29.280 --> 25:31.840
Don't let the engine lose speed.
Keep the revs high.

25:51.840 --> 25:52.720
Shit!

25:52.800 --> 25:53.920
The brakes…

25:56.720 --> 25:57.680
He won't make it.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.640
My brother isn't the problem.
The bike is too slow.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.000
Think you can do better?

26:40.440 --> 26:41.760
This thing is super heavy.

26:42.280 --> 26:44.600
Can you get the bike on your truck?
I'll show you.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.640
-Don't touch the bike.
-Let her do it.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.520
Let's see how good she is.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.360
Why are the cops here?

27:37.040 --> 27:38.920
-Mr. Farah?
-Yeah, that's me.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.880
Major Delvo.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.720
Your employee said we'd find you here.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.000
-I'm looking for Yacine Meflah.
-Yacine?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.840
Yeah, he was outside earlier.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.120
-Near the training bikes.
-Don't move!

27:53.880 --> 27:55.600
-Don't move!
-What's he doing?

27:55.680 --> 27:57.520
-No-- Hey!
-Stop!

27:57.600 --> 27:58.480
Get off!

27:59.760 --> 28:00.640
Get him off!

28:01.640 --> 28:03.360
-Come on. Move it!
-Fuck!

28:04.520 --> 28:05.840
Hey!

28:07.400 --> 28:08.560
Shit!

28:33.880 --> 28:36.080
Are you okay? I'm sorry. I didn't see you!

28:37.360 --> 28:38.520
You'll be okay.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.240
Don't move.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.720
Easy. My arm.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.640
Yeah.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.640
Impound the bike.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.000
Easy with my arm.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.880
You didn't get far.

29:03.800 --> 29:04.760
My bike.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.240
Come on. Let's go.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.120
You stay away from Yacine, understood?

29:19.840 --> 29:21.560
I didn't know. He's a bike buddy.

29:21.640 --> 29:24.680
A bike buddy? A guy who runs
from the cops is no friend.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.920
And we've lost the bike.
What will I tell Dad?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.520
What about Dad? We don't care.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.640
We don't care?

29:34.120 --> 29:36.760
It's his insurance.
He'll have to deal with all this.

29:39.440 --> 29:40.960
"We don't care." Nonsense.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.920
Can't you just stop fighting like kids?

29:45.440 --> 29:47.800
Try acting like adults
and give me a break.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.320
You see how he talks to me,
undermining me.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.760
Yes, but you asked for it.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.320
"I asked for it"? What the…?

29:58.200 --> 30:01.280
Talk to him once and for all.
It's not that complicated.

30:03.000 --> 30:03.960
It is complicated.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.560
When he talks like that, it's complicated.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.240
You two drive me crazy.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.160
-Should I come with you?
-No, wait here.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.600
The door, please.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.480
There you go.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.640
That's not enough.

31:11.960 --> 31:15.400
The pound will cost a fortune.
And I have to fix the bike, don't I?

31:31.600 --> 31:32.640
Is this enough?

31:39.800 --> 31:40.640
Thanks.

31:41.840 --> 31:42.920
Why don't you ride?

31:45.200 --> 31:47.200
Your brother hangs on your every word.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.680
You know your stuff.
So, why don't you ride?

31:52.040 --> 31:53.000
I had an accident.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.720
So what?

31:55.680 --> 31:56.880
So I don't ride anymore.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.160
I have a job for you.
It's right up your alley.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.440
A bike mechanic.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.000
But it requires absolute discretion.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.720
-What's the risk?
-You can make easy money.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.520
No trouble with the cops.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.520
I can't guarantee that.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.760
Then, no, thank you.
I've had my fill of bullshit for today.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.240
Too bad.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.920
Hope to see you soon.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.840
You don't even know her.

32:43.960 --> 32:44.960
Heard from Yacine?

32:46.400 --> 32:48.240
His brother said he won't snitch.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.200
Why was he arrested?

32:50.280 --> 32:52.400
No one knows.
His lawyer will tell us more.

32:53.160 --> 32:56.120
What about the 15th?
Do we look for another rider?

33:01.920 --> 33:04.600
Lost a glove on Bir-Hakeim bridge?
Your DNA's on it.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.360
I want a lawyer.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.000
Can you take his statement?

33:15.720 --> 33:16.640
How's your wrist?

33:20.080 --> 33:23.240
-You want to see a doctor?
-You broke my wrist. I want a lawyer.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.360
-Carjacking…
-I want a lawyer.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.880
-You're going to prison with your record.
-Shut your mouth.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.160
But you don't care. You already know that.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.000
-I want a lawyer.
-I didn't catch that. A what?

33:43.400 --> 33:44.240
To be frank…

33:45.440 --> 33:46.280
Hey!

33:47.080 --> 33:49.160
You don't matter. You're a piece of shit.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.480
Like hundreds of pieces of shit in jail.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.280
I'm interested in your TMAX.
Where did you get it?

34:02.520 --> 34:03.720
Do you have a supplier?

34:07.440 --> 34:09.640
Do you know other guys who ride that bike?

34:32.360 --> 34:33.240
Mazetti.

34:34.680 --> 34:36.360
Mazetti, the jeweler.

34:40.040 --> 34:40.880
Ring any bells?

34:45.240 --> 34:48.920
If you answer my questions,
we won't even need a lawyer.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.440
I have nothing to tell you.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.640
Don't you get it?

35:01.560 --> 35:02.400
Take him away.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.640
I want my lawyer.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.320
-Easy, my arm hurts.
-Come on. Get up.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.760
-Easy, I want a lawyer.
-We'll get you a lawyer.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.680
-I want a lawyer! Don't touch me.
-Stop arguing.

35:15.760 --> 35:16.800
Move!

35:16.880 --> 35:18.680
Get me a fucking lawyer!

35:18.760 --> 35:20.080
Calm down.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.680
-I'll close up and join you later.
-Okay.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.120
I never understood why your mother
loved this bike so much.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.400
The engine lacks power.
The frame is not solid enough.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.280
It's hard to ride…

36:16.880 --> 36:18.000
And the color…

36:20.360 --> 36:21.600
Yeah.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.240
She loved it. Well…

36:30.080 --> 36:31.880
Maybe she liked its flaws.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.200
There's no shortage of those.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.880
That's why she loved you too.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.240
I miss her.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.840
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I'M IN.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.480
We're shipping you out.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.000
-Your jacket.
-Where's my lawyer?

38:19.680 --> 38:21.480
Enough with the lawyer. Put that on.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.320
I'm not kidding. I want my lawyer.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.840
Get out. I'm sick of you.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.760
-I'm sick of you too.
-Come on. Move.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.200
-Move. Hurry up.
-The handcuffs are hurting me!

38:37.280 --> 38:38.280
I don't give a damn!

38:38.920 --> 38:40.400
I don't give a fuck!

38:40.480 --> 38:42.640
Fucking cops! Go fuck yourselves!

38:45.560 --> 38:47.600
Stay here. Don't move.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.240
Hey! Get him!

39:11.280 --> 39:13.200
-Are you okay? Show me.
-I'm fine.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.600
It worked. The tracker is activated.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.120
You were only supposed to struggle.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.920
You wanted it to look real.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.560
What, Delvo?

39:28.320 --> 39:29.160
Did I overdo it?

39:30.880 --> 39:33.080
-Did I?
-Fuck! We had a deal!

39:33.160 --> 39:34.960
Deal's off. Get lost.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.000
Fucking cops. You can't be trusted.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.840
I'm never helping you again!

39:39.920 --> 39:42.440
-Eyes on Yacine, 24/7.
-Fucking cops!

39:42.520 --> 39:44.360
-Get lost.
-Fucking cops!

39:44.440 --> 39:46.640
If I ever see your face again…

39:46.720 --> 39:47.880
-Get lost!
-Bastard!

39:47.960 --> 39:49.160
I was helping you!

39:52.840 --> 39:55.320
It'll be ready tomorrow.
Sorry for the delay.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.800
-I'll come back tomorrow, thanks.
-Goodbye, sir.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.320
What's wrong?

40:10.080 --> 40:11.720
-Did you know?
-Know what?

40:12.320 --> 40:14.000
Yacine carjacked a guy on a TMAX.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.520
-I don't get it.
-Are you sure about that?

40:17.400 --> 40:18.560
Is that an accusation?

40:19.600 --> 40:22.000
-Don't you trust me?
-This shit makes you paranoid.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.640
You bring in a strange girl
and you're telling--

40:24.720 --> 40:27.560
She's not the problem, Yacine is.
He's on the run.

40:36.640 --> 40:39.320
-Okay, did he snitch?
-No, if he had, we'd be in jail.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.440
We shouldn't have hired him.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.480
-I'll handle it.
-Don't do anything.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.320
Stick to the plan.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.240
Hello, Soélie.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.680
Hi.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.560
How are you?
Nice to see you again. This way.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.200
Here are the beasts.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.880
These bikes must be ready in three days.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.680
You'll work with Théo.
He's made good progress.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.360
Here's the T-Cross
you already know. The Naked.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.440
And in the back, the Turbo.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.080
What's with the names?

42:06.360 --> 42:08.000
The T-Cross you saw yesterday.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.280
It has to smash through any obstacle.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.600
Even if we increase engine torque,
the fork will have issues.

42:14.680 --> 42:15.600
Exactly.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.360
I need to work on the suspension.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.080
The Naked, with no engine cover.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.880
It needs more agility and power.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.360
The goal is to make it light
and ultra-easy to ride.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.640
And the Turbo needs more speed.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.520
It needs to reach 230 over long distances.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.280
We'll need a boosted variator.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.160
You'll lose top speed,
but it's worth a shot.

42:40.880 --> 42:41.920
I have a question.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.840
And a request.

42:43.920 --> 42:44.840
Go on.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.800
Why convert scooters?

42:48.320 --> 42:49.480
Just take a dirt bike.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.320
Top speed, mobility and rider stability.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.200
And the request?

42:58.760 --> 42:59.720
A hundred thousand.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.160
100,000 euros is a lot of money, kid.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.640
You're not planning a picnic, right?
I don't want details.

43:13.160 --> 43:14.320
Take it or leave it.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.760
So, you start right away
and work all night if needed.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.120
And you're at my disposal round the clock.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.120
Okay.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.680
Good. We have a deal then.

43:41.920 --> 43:42.840
Oh, fuck.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.080
Shit.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.320
Here she is.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.960
So, where's the Yam?

43:55.040 --> 43:57.240
-We had a problem.
-With what?

43:59.600 --> 44:00.480
A problem.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.720
-This man is a police officer.
-Major Delvo.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.320
We met at the driving school.

44:07.320 --> 44:08.720
Why were you two there?

44:09.960 --> 44:12.960
Yacine had asked me to replace him.
To test a bike.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.040
Is Yacine a friend?

44:16.320 --> 44:18.080
We've trained a few times together.

44:19.480 --> 44:22.520
-What about you?
-I've seen him once or twice, that's it.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.760
Why didn't you tell your dad
his bike was stolen?

44:25.840 --> 44:29.120
I had forbidden them to do this.
It seems it had no effect.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.280
We'll fix it.

44:30.360 --> 44:32.240
Have you spoken to Yacine since?

44:33.960 --> 44:35.080
No.

44:37.640 --> 44:41.520
Where were you last night?
Your dad was surprised you weren't here.

44:42.040 --> 44:44.480
-With a friend. You need more details?
-No.

44:49.600 --> 44:52.440
We'll keep the bike for investigation.
We'll return it.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.800
Thank you, Daniel.

44:55.720 --> 44:56.560
You're welcome.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.200
Daniel?

45:04.000 --> 45:05.840
-It's the bank on the phone.
-Coming.

45:17.200 --> 45:18.120
Yes?

45:20.960 --> 45:23.600
What shit have you two gotten into?

45:28.320 --> 45:29.760
This kind of shit.

45:30.840 --> 45:33.760
What's that? Where did this come from?

45:35.720 --> 45:37.200
It's thanks to Michael.

45:37.280 --> 45:38.360
He tested a bike.

45:38.440 --> 45:39.760
It's a job like any other.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.440
-We want to help.
-Help?

45:42.960 --> 45:44.680
By bringing a cop home?

45:44.760 --> 45:46.800
You call that helping? That cop…

45:46.880 --> 45:48.760
-What's his name again?
-Delvo.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.840
-Delvo.
-He means business.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.400
He's an ex-champion.
He never gave up back then.

45:53.480 --> 45:56.080
Yeah. Do you know what he told me?

45:57.520 --> 46:01.440
Your friend Yacine has been accused
of armed robbery.

46:01.520 --> 46:02.760
Did you know that?

46:02.840 --> 46:05.240
-We have nothing to do with that.
-Really?

46:06.240 --> 46:07.240
I hope so.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.800
Because I've had my fill
of bullshit, okay?

46:12.720 --> 46:15.280
I know the situation is bad,
but it will get better.

46:15.800 --> 46:17.720
I'm touched that you feel concerned.

46:18.240 --> 46:21.280
But let me deal with it on my own. Okay?

46:24.040 --> 46:25.040
Are we clear?

46:28.280 --> 46:29.640
Who's this friend of yours?

46:30.200 --> 46:31.440
You want details too?

46:32.280 --> 46:33.720
Can't I have a private life?

46:35.760 --> 46:38.920
Hélène, smoke outside!
This isn't the '80s!

46:39.760 --> 46:40.720
That's a shame.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.040
BESTOFFER.CO

47:44.400 --> 47:46.080
-Need a hand?
-No.

47:57.600 --> 48:00.120
I'll sleep for an hour.
Try not to ruin my work.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.600
He should land at 11:30 a.m.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.520
This is the route to the hotel.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.560
-What about security?
-Only one car.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.520
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.440
That's the tracker. Stick it on.

48:25.040 --> 48:26.600
Be careful. It's fragile.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.440
On the remote, push here once.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.240
Give me one.

48:52.920 --> 48:53.800
Here.

48:58.720 --> 49:00.280
Can we get the exact floor?

49:00.360 --> 49:02.880
He hasn't left the building,
but we're watching.

49:33.880 --> 49:35.640
It's like riding a fucking bicycle.

49:36.320 --> 49:39.560
-No idea what you did, but you nailed it.
-You seem to like it.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.160
It's unrecognizable.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.440
How's the Turbo going?

49:52.000 --> 49:53.200
It's getting there. So?

49:53.720 --> 49:54.720
Yeah, it's done.

49:54.800 --> 49:58.280
Half of your bikes are in storage.
I'll get the rest when you're done.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.240
Here's a spare key.

50:09.640 --> 50:10.520
Your dad's nice.

50:13.480 --> 50:14.960
Yeah, when he feels like it.

50:22.560 --> 50:23.640
Thank you.

51:08.920 --> 51:09.800
Nice one!

51:19.920 --> 51:20.760
Well…

51:21.280 --> 51:23.280
You can get the rest of your bikes back.

51:25.480 --> 51:26.320
Thank you.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.320
I don't mean to pry. Can I ask a question?

51:46.600 --> 51:47.600
Yes, go ahead.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.400
Have you ridden since your accident?

51:52.560 --> 51:54.080
I don't want to talk about it.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.200
Okay, sorry.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.320
My mom died from cancer.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.240
I was full of rage.

52:22.040 --> 52:23.200
I was mad at the world.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.160
So I took her bike.

52:37.520 --> 52:38.600
I rode at full speed.

52:40.280 --> 52:41.160
Without thinking.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.720
A month in hospital
and a year of physical therapy.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.200
When I tried to ride again, it was over.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.280
I was reliving my fall every time.

53:05.920 --> 53:09.160
Like panic attacks,
tremors and everything.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.000
I can barely ride a bicycle.

53:14.920 --> 53:16.320
But these things get better.

53:17.880 --> 53:18.720
Yeah?

53:19.400 --> 53:20.280
I don't know.

53:25.320 --> 53:27.240
Maybe you should take it slowly.

53:29.120 --> 53:32.760
I don't know much, but there are shrinks
who can help with that, right?

53:37.920 --> 53:40.360
It helps people
who have been through trauma.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.320
Why wouldn't it help you?

53:59.760 --> 54:01.960
YACINE
HEY BRO! I GOT A NEW GIG.

54:02.040 --> 54:05.000
20K FOR YOU.
I'LL CALL YOU IN AN HOUR, OKAY?

54:11.920 --> 54:16.320
MICHAEL
OKAY, CALL ME. THE COPS LET YOU GO?

54:16.400 --> 54:17.840
There's movement.

54:17.920 --> 54:19.680
That prick never moved!

54:22.960 --> 54:24.160
Boss, we have a visual.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.280
He changed his jacket.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.200
He's taking his bike. What now?

54:39.280 --> 54:40.920
-Follow him.
-Okay.

54:43.560 --> 54:45.760
We're not using walkies.
Don't get too close.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.320
Watch out for the red light.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.680
-He took the bike path!
-Put the overheads on!

54:56.760 --> 54:58.560
It's a mess. We're blocked in!

55:02.000 --> 55:05.120
Boss, it's over. We lost him.
No way to locate him.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.400
Shit!

55:14.880 --> 55:16.840
-What are you doing here?
-It's Yacine.

55:17.360 --> 55:18.560
What about him?

55:18.640 --> 55:20.640
-He said to come here.
-He's coming here?

55:21.520 --> 55:22.560
He's on his way.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.840
I heard you have a job for me.

55:27.320 --> 55:28.280
Elyas, we're ready.

55:30.400 --> 55:32.320
Why is he here? Is there a problem?

55:32.400 --> 55:33.440
Here's the problem.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.240
Inside.

55:38.520 --> 55:39.440
You too.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.280
You're a real dumbass.

55:52.320 --> 55:53.240
Watch your tongue.

55:54.760 --> 55:55.800
You, don't move.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.400
I'll talk however I want.
Cops are after you.

55:59.480 --> 56:02.400
-You're jeopardizing the operation.
-I've got a rider.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.440
The rider isn't your problem.

56:06.960 --> 56:08.680
Michael will do it. If you're ready…

56:08.760 --> 56:10.760
If I'm what? If I'm ready?

56:14.480 --> 56:16.480
Months of work and you ask if I'm ready?

56:22.240 --> 56:25.320
Three years of pulling off heists
and I was never caught. Why?

56:26.320 --> 56:27.240
Ask me why.

56:27.880 --> 56:28.880
Why?

56:29.680 --> 56:30.520
Why?

56:31.840 --> 56:33.200
Because I'm a professional.

56:34.080 --> 56:35.720
I plan everything to the second.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.320
I gave you a chance.

56:48.880 --> 56:50.400
You behaved like shit.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.760
And you brought a friend.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.720
What did he tell you? What do you know?

56:59.760 --> 57:03.200
He told me about
a run on a scooter and a robbery.

57:03.280 --> 57:04.600
How much did he offer you?

57:07.840 --> 57:08.880
Twenty thousand.

57:11.440 --> 57:12.400
Twenty thousand.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.520
You're a real piece of shit.

57:15.880 --> 57:17.200
Twenty thousand euros?

57:21.520 --> 57:23.320
And the cops? Tell me.

57:25.120 --> 57:26.600
How did you escape?

57:27.320 --> 57:28.400
What? I ran away.

57:29.560 --> 57:31.240
-You ran away?
-Yes.

57:32.400 --> 57:33.240
He ran away.

57:36.200 --> 57:37.040
Okay.

57:38.360 --> 57:41.760
So, you're in police custody,
you get arrested for armed robbery,

57:42.880 --> 57:44.680
and you escaped? Just like that?

57:46.240 --> 57:48.840
Are you serious?
Are you guys getting paranoid?

57:49.360 --> 57:50.720
I ran away. I'm clean.

57:50.800 --> 57:54.360
The cops were busy restraining
a drunk guy, so I ran away.

57:54.440 --> 57:55.920
Let's stick to the plan.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.080
I do the job, take my cut
and leave the country. End of story.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.000
Michael--

58:09.760 --> 58:10.880
Don't fuck up, Elyas.

58:20.720 --> 58:21.560
Don't move!

58:26.280 --> 58:27.120
Hey!

58:27.920 --> 58:30.960
Hey! You want to rob people?
Here, go ahead.

58:31.040 --> 58:32.600
Show me what you can do.

58:33.120 --> 58:34.400
That's what a gun is for.

58:46.320 --> 58:48.160
Now, I've got your brother's prints.

58:48.920 --> 58:50.600
No choice. You're my third rider.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.280
Let's go! Everyone on the bikes!

58:56.640 --> 58:57.560
Are you okay?

58:57.640 --> 58:59.440
-On your bikes!
-Come on.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.480
The cops are coming.
We're out of time. Come on!

59:09.560 --> 59:10.760
-Hurry!
-Come on, Mika.

59:11.360 --> 59:12.360
Let go of me!

59:13.840 --> 59:16.080
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll send the address.

59:18.280 --> 59:19.960
-Théo!
-Yeah, I'll follow her.

59:22.720 --> 59:23.800
Hurry up, Mika!

59:42.320 --> 59:43.520
Come on! Go, Soélie!

59:50.680 --> 59:51.880
You'll be fine.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.480
I'm right behind you.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.120
Sir.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.560
It's a real bike lab, high-tech.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.240
All hidden behind their shop.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.960
-Any traces of the TMAXs?
-Nothing.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.400
They've cleaned the place.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.320
What about him?

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.760
What do you mean?

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.440
He wasn't supposed to get killed
when we let him go.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.200
You know nothing.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.600
I'll take care of it.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.080
-I just wanted the money, that's all…
-I know,

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.560
I know.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.000
I know.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.480
We were at the movies, okay? That's all.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.120
Hey. Look at me.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.720
Look at me.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.800
We were at the movies. Together. Okay?

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.080
Come here.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.800
Get some sleep.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.680
So?

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.320
Thanks.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.880
Where are the bikes?

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.440
I hid them in the shed.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.360
Where's Elyas?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.840
In a hideout somewhere.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.480
-Great.
-He knows what he's doing.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560
Will you stop?

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.720
Your pal is a murderer.
He just killed a guy!

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.080
Don't you understand? He played me!

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.480
-I'm sorry, it wasn't supposed to--
-I don't give a damn, okay?

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.480
My brother will face
a murder charge, not you.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.280
I have no choice.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.400
I didn't think he'd go that far.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.520
Soélie, you need to trust me.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.520
Trust me.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.560
Is there a place I can sleep?

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.720
Hey…

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.840
I thought I saw a ghost.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.360
You looked like your mother.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.800
It was overwhelming.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:14.880
Sorry.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.440
Sorry for what?

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.440
I'm the one who's sorry.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.200
I realized it suited me
that you stopped riding.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.480
It made me feel better.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.640
I could protect you.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.520
The way I wanted to protect
your mom from her sickness.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.520
The thrill you get out
of that bike, my girl,

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.920
is the most beautiful thing
I've seen in a long time.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.080
Well, you've got to practice now.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.120
You knew you wouldn't sell it.

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.840
This one? Never.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.120
I sold the other bikes,
which will buy us some time.

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.240
Excuse me.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.600
Did you forget something in the kitchen?

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.080
A guy in his underwear.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.240
What?

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.560
-He's a friend.
-A friend?

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.880
-A biker.
-A biker in his underwear?

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.520
I'll handle this. Right?

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.480
Here.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.520
Thanks.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.560
Hélène, what the heck is going on?

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.000
Don't worry.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.560
-See you at the shed.
-I'll join you.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.640
It will be all right.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.560
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.400
No.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.120
You stay here.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.600
You handle Dad.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.600
And whatever happens…

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.720
We stay alive.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.920
Here's what we know.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.240
Mazetti will land at the heliport.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.120
There will be two cars,
the convoy we're interested in.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.760
If you have cold feet, now's the time.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.680
-Théo?
-I'm good.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.680
Soélie? Are you ready?

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.320
Are you ready?

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.120
I have no choice.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.120
Okay.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.920
Right,

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.800
as we said,

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.360
11:30 a.m., in position, Panama Square.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.920
I'm here. Théo, you're here.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.760
Soélie, I want you here,
waiting for the convoy.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.440
Mazetti arrives for Crystal Week
with six convoys.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.720
Four via the airports,
one via the heliport plus an armored van.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.640
For Christ's sake, Lucas. Wake up.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.600
It's not about that.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.640
I can cover two transfers with my team.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.680
If you let me mobilize special forces,

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.120
we'll have enough men to cover
each convoy should we locate them.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.480
You'll be suspended.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.400
Until they find out how Yacine escaped.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.440
If everything goes as planned…

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.760
we stay on course.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.800
But if the cops follow us, we'll split.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.240
We'll take turns.
That's when it'll get technical.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.680
We'll use the GPS.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.280
I want constant communication.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.560
We'll drive them crazy.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.280
-The kid died because you fucked up…
-Cut the crap.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.600
You're so obsessed and you won't admit it.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.320
Judging me will not change the outcome.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.120
They'll strike tomorrow, and it's on you.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.680
Hand over your badge and weapon.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.760
I can't help you anymore.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.480
Okay.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.120
Pretend I'm not here.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.520
Please.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.560
We're on. Stand by.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.280
Copy.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.160
Copy.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.680
-When do we get there?
-In 15 minutes, Mr. Mazetti.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.440
GPS activated.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.200
Soélie, on my mark. Go!

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.680
Look out!

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.640
Watch it!

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.680
Come on, let's go! Strike now!

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.880
Get out of here! Move!

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.120
Come on, move!

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.840
Come on!

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.920
Move! Get lost! Come on, get out of here!

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.960
Get lost!

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.560
I said, move!

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.400
Théo, behind you!

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.680
Get lost!

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.240
Cover me, Théo!

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.080
The stones!

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:11.520
The stones!

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.360
Don't fuck with me.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:24.920
Hurry up, Elyas!

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.840
-I've got the diamonds! Let's go!
-Okay.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.840
Let's get out of here!

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:01.840
What now?

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.480
I've got you this time.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.880
Plan B. Let's split!

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.160
Biker on my tail.
I'll shake him off. Stay in contact!

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.920
All units, suspects heading toward Rivoli.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.600
Unit V32 has a visual. Engaging.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:26.920
Unit V32, give way…

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.560
Fuck!

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.720
-What's wrong with you?
-Police! Move!

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:54.560
Fuck you!

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.560
Watch out! It's the cop from the highway.
He won't give up.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.800
Théo, are you ready? It's your turn.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.040
I see you. I'm coming!

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.440
Nice one!

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.600
Come and get me!

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.200
Soélie, your turn!

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.760
Where the fuck are you?

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.440
Shit…

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.320
What's going on, Théo? Come in, Théo!

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.800
Answer, goddammit!

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.960
-Are you okay, sir?
-I'm fine. I said, I'm fine!

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.120
Sir? Are you sure?

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.520
Get on!

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.960
We'll be too slow! Go!

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.600
Fuck!

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.160
Wait! Did you find him, Soélie?

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.120
Théo crashed. I've got the stones.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.200
What's happening? Where's Théo?

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.080
I'm going to the meeting point.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.720
A police car and a bike.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.640
Get rid of them. Figure it out!

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.920
There are too many! I can't hold them off.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.040
Stop!

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.760
Change of plans.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.000
Fuck!

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.680
We need to stop him.
He won't give up! Elyas, do you copy?

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.960
Stay focused.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.440
What are you doing? He'll catch me!

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.320
Go! I just want the stones.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.800
Hurry up!

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.120
Oh, fuck!

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.920
The gun.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.960
I got rid of it.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.840
I never wanted
to send your brother to jail.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.720
I needed a third rider.
And you were available.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.520
Come on. Let me go.

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.080
Give me the key.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.360
Hurry up. Théo is waiting for us.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:39.640
You won't see him again.

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.160
Three of us witnessed you killing Yacine.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.800
If you talk, we will too.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.640
Let me go and cut the crap. Uncuff me!

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.400
Don't tell me what to do or how.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.640
It's over.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.560
Okay.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.800
ONE YEAR LATER

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.400
Daniel!

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.520
So…

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.200
How are you?

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.640
I see you kept your track.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.560
Are you here for the race
or to ask questions?

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.760
I don't ask questions anymore.
Not officially anyway.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.480
-But I'll get the answers.
-What answers?

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:37.520
Come on, Daniel. We'll miss the race.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.320
-What did he want?
-Nothing. Everything's fine.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:48.760
Today is the big day. Enjoy yourself.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.520
-Try to beat your sister.
-Don't mind him. Just focus.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.720
Have a good race.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.800
Have a good race.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.520
Here we are.
Welcome to the Carella racetrack

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.760
for this international trophy,
where we are witnessing

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.400
Soélie Carella's comeback,
two-time world champion,

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.040
who literally grew up on racetracks.

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:25.000
Let's welcome her
after two years of absence,

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.400
lining up at the start
beside her brother, Michael.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:32.640
And I can tell you that these two
grew up with a taste for competition.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:37.400
All the riders here today are ready
to push their limits for this new season.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.520
It'll be a great show.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:46.760
There is a huge crowd today
for this big sporting event.

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:52.720
Brother and sister are warming up,
getting ready for the race.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.520
They won't be kind to each other,
under the eagle eyes

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.240
of a very proud Daniel Carella.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.040
If the atmosphere is right,

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:06.520
I assure you that their fighting spirit
will blow us away today.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.560
We're ready to start.
All the riders are here.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:33.560
Final preparations.
The engines are warming up.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:37.240
We're clearing the start line
and the flag is about to wave.

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.600
It will be explosive!

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.240
Are you ready for this epic race?

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.160
Are you all paying attention?

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.880
Make some noise, Carella fans!
We can't hear you!

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.680
Make some noise! Fifteen seconds!

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.360
Fifteen seconds to remind you
that Michael Carella, on the Yam 107,

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:59.400
had the best time in the trials.
Five seconds!

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.280
Soélie wearing number 106.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.840
Here we go! Full steam ahead!

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.440
And they're off!

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.920
