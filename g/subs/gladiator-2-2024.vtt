31:27.250 --> 31:28.250
You have worms.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.083
I know this one.

31:34.833 --> 31:35.833
He eats monkeys.

31:45.708 --> 31:48.391
[thunder]

31:50.291 --> 31:51.808
Go. Sit. Eat.

32:16.083 --> 32:21.226
[thunder]

32:21.250 --> 32:32.291
[whimpering]

32:32.375 --> 32:35.350
[screaming]

32:45.708 --> 32:49.350
[screaming]

32:52.708 --> 32:53.708
You.

32:55.750 --> 32:56.850
I know. Get up.

33:04.291 --> 33:07.391
What is your native
language? I speak them all.

33:11.958 --> 33:14.266
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't.

33:17.208 --> 33:18.208
All right.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.850
Violence is the universal language.

33:22.166 --> 33:24.641
Vigo, put him through his paces.

33:25.375 --> 33:27.808
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he can fight a man.

33:46.375 --> 33:47.808
[sighing]

34:15.833 --> 34:18.684
[laughing]

34:18.708 --> 34:23.434
[laughing]

34:23.458 --> 34:35.083
[grunting]

34:35.166 --> 34:38.600
The arena!

34:44.291 --> 34:45.291
Very good.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Very good.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.516
Close him down.

34:55.458 --> 34:58.475
Bring him to me.

35:03.708 --> 35:04.708
Ah!

35:08.250 --> 35:09.250
Strong jaw.

35:11.625 --> 35:12.625
Good arms.

35:14.083 --> 35:15.083
Better smell.

35:18.708 --> 35:19.808
Ah, you would do well.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.250
It is an art.

35:23.458 --> 35:24.458
Choosing gladiators.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.850
Some choose entertainers.

35:28.958 --> 35:30.475
Some choose brute force.

35:30.916 --> 35:31.916
I choose rage.

35:36.958 --> 35:40.392
Crowd loves blood and they love
those who love blood as much as they do.

35:40.416 --> 35:42.141
And you, my friend, rage,

35:43.708 --> 35:45.225
pours out of you like...

35:47.041 --> 35:48.041
like milk.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.391
From a horse tit.

35:52.833 --> 35:53.891
You will be quite the fighter.

35:54.416 --> 35:55.416
Not for you.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.141
You're right. You do not fight for me.

35:59.125 --> 36:01.808
I put you in the ring. You
fight or you die. The choice is yours.

36:02.125 --> 36:07.933
But whose head could I give
you that would satisfy this fury?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.058
The entire Roman armies.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.516
[laughing]

36:14.416 --> 36:14.684
Too much.

36:14.708 --> 36:18.308
The general will do.

36:19.666 --> 36:20.666
General?

36:21.708 --> 36:22.708
General Acacis?

36:26.125 --> 36:32.100
Use your rage in my service, then
you will have his head ready for your sword.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.266
Serve me and host serve you. Deny me.

36:36.416 --> 36:38.516
And you will die.

36:41.041 --> 36:42.041
At times I will wish you the best.

36:42.708 --> 36:44.975
You should abandon me
rather than fight their wars.

36:45.375 --> 36:46.391
I've made my choice.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.641
I can live with it.

36:54.208 --> 36:57.641
But my patience
with those two is at an end.

37:01.125 --> 37:02.125
Letter.

37:02.833 --> 37:04.558
You may go to your quarters now.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.391
We need nothing more.

37:13.708 --> 37:16.891
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead on that beach at Numidia.

37:20.291 --> 37:21.291
Silla.

37:26.708 --> 37:27.708
No more.

37:29.208 --> 37:35.600
I will not waste another
generation of young men for their vanity.

37:36.958 --> 37:41.558
If I fight another
campaign, it must be to depose them.

37:44.041 --> 37:45.350
When will your troops arrive?

37:46.916 --> 37:48.516
We landed Austrian ten days.

37:49.458 --> 37:52.266
How many of them
will be loyal to you alone?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
All of them.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.016
The empress do not
have the support of the people.

38:02.083 --> 38:05.684
The people are weary of
the madness, of the tyranny.

38:05.708 --> 38:10.933
What is the dream of Rome?

38:11.916 --> 38:12.916
That people are not free.

38:36.708 --> 38:37.708
Enjoy yourselves, everyone.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.891
To excess.

38:41.166 --> 38:42.142
Thank you.

38:42.166 --> 38:51.750
Thank you.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.333
Wow.

38:58.958 --> 38:59.958
Please.

39:00.458 --> 39:01.267
Drink.

39:01.291 --> 39:01.809
Ah!

39:01.833 --> 39:02.833
Excuse me.

39:04.708 --> 39:07.183
I knew the
provinces were not enough for you.

39:07.958 --> 39:09.641
I'm just here for the games.

39:09.708 --> 39:10.708
Ah, well.

39:11.583 --> 39:12.683
You won't be disappointed.

39:12.958 --> 39:16.267
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

39:16.291 --> 39:18.141
Men like me, Thrax, men like us.

39:18.541 --> 39:21.808
I know nothing happens in
Rome unless you've tasted it first.

39:33.708 --> 39:37.225
[crowd cheering]

39:38.791 --> 39:39.891
How's my purpose here?

39:40.375 --> 39:41.683
We'll find out. It's only now.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.392
What's this we hear
about you being interested

39:48.416 --> 39:51.391
in standing for
election to the Senate, Macalus?

39:52.250 --> 39:55.141
Me? No. No, I'm not.

39:55.458 --> 39:57.726
I don't even know how to use an abacus.

39:57.750 --> 40:02.808
But I do understand that it's
customary for your guests to make wages.

40:03.750 --> 40:06.725
How large a sum did you have in mind?

40:08.625 --> 40:10.226
A thousand gold denarii?

40:10.250 --> 40:11.250
Two.

40:13.541 --> 40:14.541
Two?

40:16.541 --> 40:17.351
Denarii.

40:17.375 --> 40:18.375
Mmm.

40:34.833 --> 40:35.833
Stand back!

40:36.500 --> 40:37.683
Stand back!

40:39.083 --> 40:44.433
My emperors, lords,
ladies and gentlemen, and senators,

40:45.000 --> 40:49.808
for your
entertainment, the art of combat.

40:52.333 --> 40:59.683
May I present the barbarian
versus from my own stable, the mighty Vitek!

41:00.083 --> 41:01.641
[crowd cheering]

41:07.750 --> 41:08.750
This is your radiator.

41:09.208 --> 41:11.308
It is.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.725
Three rounds, hand to hand. Swords!

41:18.166 --> 41:20.516
We want swords to fight to the death.

41:22.541 --> 41:26.933
No quarter to be
offered or given. Fight now.

41:29.708 --> 41:32.808
Brother, I am the king of the gods.

41:35.583 --> 41:36.808
Let's not kill each
other for their amusement.

42:08.958 --> 42:13.309

42:13.333 --> 42:13.767

[CROWD CHEERING]

42:47.458 --> 42:48.458
Remarkable!

42:50.083 --> 42:52.016
Drex, you looked expensive for her.

42:53.583 --> 42:54.583
Congratulations.

42:54.625 --> 42:55.625
Thank you.

42:56.750 --> 42:57.750
Remarkable.

43:02.833 --> 43:03.833
From where do you hail?

43:10.041 --> 43:11.041
Speak.

43:14.791 --> 43:15.726
I said speak.

43:15.750 --> 43:16.750
He is from the colonies.

43:17.291 --> 43:19.558
Your Majesty, his native
tongue is all he understands.

43:26.708 --> 43:29.058
The gates of hell are open night and day.

43:30.208 --> 43:35.766
Smooth is the descent and easiest away.

43:40.333 --> 43:48.333
But to come back from hell
and view the cheerful skies in this,

43:48.666 --> 43:51.184
the task and mighty labor lies.

43:51.208 --> 43:57.350
[PANTING]

43:59.208 --> 44:00.208
Virgil, your Majesty.

44:01.541 --> 44:02.541
Poetry!

44:03.333 --> 44:04.933
[LAUGHTER]

44:05.583 --> 44:07.016
Very clever, my goodness.

44:07.166 --> 44:08.166
Thank you.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.850
I've grown so
bored, but you surprised me.

44:12.375 --> 44:15.101
To amuse you is my only wish.

44:15.125 --> 44:16.558
We are amused. We are amused.

44:18.916 --> 44:19.916
We are amused.

44:21.500 --> 44:26.850
And we all look forward to
seeing your poet perform in the arena.

44:27.375 --> 44:29.725
As do I, your Majesties.

44:30.875 --> 44:31.875
Thank you.

44:32.958 --> 44:35.308
Vigo, come with me.

44:47.208 --> 44:51.183
[PANTING]

44:54.208 --> 44:56.266
You fought well
today, but you were lucky too.

44:59.291 --> 45:00.683
The lines you recited.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.725
You didn't learn
that in Africa. I know that.

45:05.250 --> 45:06.808
A good verse travels far.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Who taught you poetry?

45:09.708 --> 45:11.183
A captioned Roman officer.

45:12.458 --> 45:16.308
I was posted guard over him, and
he used to tell us tales to pass the time.

45:17.958 --> 45:19.183
And what became of this prison?

45:19.458 --> 45:20.558
How we ate him.

45:22.166 --> 45:23.391
As barbarians do.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.975
As barbarians do.

45:25.750 --> 45:26.750
And where were you born?

45:27.833 --> 45:31.600
Why does my past matter if it is
my future to die for you in the arena?

45:38.208 --> 45:41.266
Tell me what you survive for Roman money.

45:42.208 --> 45:48.058
A gladiator can buy his own freedom.

45:49.750 --> 45:50.750
His liberty.

45:52.583 --> 45:53.583
The Roman dream.

45:54.541 --> 45:58.600
The slave dreams not of
freedom, but of a slave to call his own.

45:59.833 --> 46:00.833
Cicero.

46:02.416 --> 46:04.058
Is that what you
were raised on, Maccrelas?

46:05.583 --> 46:07.266
What did you have to do for Roman money?

46:08.208 --> 46:11.225
You promised me a head.

46:12.083 --> 46:13.308
Earn your keep and
you can have anyone's head.

46:39.125 --> 46:47.791
Father, protect us and guide us.

46:57.375 --> 46:58.375
Senators.

46:59.375 --> 47:00.375
My lady.

47:01.208 --> 47:09.208
I wish we were meeting in better times.

47:11.041 --> 47:12.266
Better times will come.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.850
And why are we here?

47:16.666 --> 47:17.891
To take back the city.

47:20.333 --> 47:24.433
And restore Rome to where she should be.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.516
An exciting venture.

47:27.166 --> 47:28.808
When? On the final day of the games.
When? On the final day of the games. When?

47:29.416 --> 47:30.725
On the final day of the games.

47:31.916 --> 47:33.725
My army waits for my command at Ostia.

47:34.833 --> 47:36.766
Five thousand soldiers loyal to me.

47:39.083 --> 47:43.559
We'll enter Rome and then the
Colosseum where they will arrest the emperors for

47:43.583 --> 47:46.683
their crimes against
the Senate and their people.

47:48.708 --> 47:52.516
This plan is ambitious and risky.

47:53.666 --> 47:56.184
Rome will be yours
to administer and to...

47:56.208 --> 48:00.558
Marcus Aurelius talked of
restoring power to the Senate.

48:01.041 --> 48:04.058
But that was a
generation ago. Much has changed.

48:05.458 --> 48:08.100
The people have not seen hope.

48:09.541 --> 48:10.725
For many years.

48:10.875 --> 48:11.875
But with time.

48:13.375 --> 48:14.375
And guidance.

48:15.416 --> 48:19.016
Lucilla, you are the
daughter of Marcus Aurelius.

48:19.375 --> 48:20.975
He had my loyalty.

48:23.750 --> 48:24.850
And so do you.

48:27.875 --> 48:28.891
Senator Thraxx.

48:31.041 --> 48:33.725
Politics follows power, my lady.

48:35.375 --> 48:37.808
Take back what is rightfully yours.

48:39.208 --> 48:41.683
And the Senate will support you.

48:42.541 --> 48:43.541
Thank you.

49:02.333 --> 49:09.808
When I was told of this
place, you never mentioned the stink.

49:12.208 --> 49:13.308
That would be Hanos.

49:17.208 --> 49:19.891
Well, you'll have
to put up with me as I am.

49:22.333 --> 49:27.516
And what's that up there? A wolf?

49:29.833 --> 49:31.850
The twins there, they were outcasts.

49:33.375 --> 49:34.516
Left in the hills to die.

49:36.708 --> 49:39.433
That wolf found them.
She suckled them on her milk.

49:41.583 --> 49:43.391
Raised by an
animal that's in their blood.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.500
How do you know this place?

49:47.916 --> 49:49.308
I know the chaos they brought.

49:51.041 --> 49:53.100
This city infects everything it touches.

49:54.041 --> 49:55.683
I never dreamt it would be so big.

49:56.208 --> 49:59.308
Don't fall for it. This city is diseased.

50:40.541 --> 50:53.208
The No way!

51:11.875 --> 51:12.875
Ah!

51:15.250 --> 51:19.558
Stare speakers and happy honeyfuckers.

51:20.291 --> 51:22.351
Ah, the barbarian.

51:22.375 --> 51:23.226
I haven't forgotten.

51:23.250 --> 51:23.851
I always repay my debts.

51:23.875 --> 51:25.517
I was merely going to suggest

51:25.541 --> 51:27.726
that perhaps your luck might change,

51:27.750 --> 51:29.350
shall we say double of things.

51:32.500 --> 51:38.517
(laughing)

51:38.541 --> 51:43.308
(dramatic music)

52:03.083 --> 52:06.101

52:06.125 --> 52:10.891
Light up, light up.

52:41.666 --> 52:42.517

52:42.541 --> 52:43.683
Lay, lay.

52:44.416 --> 52:47.016
(horn blaring)

52:49.625 --> 52:53.891
(cheering)

53:00.000 --> 53:01.183
Emperor Katicala,

53:02.625 --> 53:03.725
Emperor Gator,

53:05.041 --> 53:07.350
citizens of Rome.

53:09.250 --> 53:15.391
These sacred games are
held to honor the victory of Rome

53:15.875 --> 53:18.558
over the barbarians of Numidia.

53:18.833 --> 53:24.850
(yelling)

53:25.375 --> 53:28.225
And honor Rome's legionary commander,

53:29.041 --> 53:31.141
General Eustace Acacius.

53:31.416 --> 53:33.933

53:34.208 --> 53:36.475
And with him, Lucilla,

53:37.250 --> 53:40.141
the daughter of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

53:41.541 --> 53:44.850
(cheering)

53:46.750 --> 53:47.750
Acacius.

53:48.583 --> 53:49.583
General.

53:50.625 --> 53:58.350
(cheering)

53:59.000 --> 54:07.250
Speak to them.

54:07.833 --> 54:10.016
(cheering)

54:18.625 --> 54:22.183
I am not an orator or a politician.

54:24.250 --> 54:25.250
I am a soldier.

54:28.708 --> 54:32.683
I've seen bravery in
men and women during war,

54:34.291 --> 54:35.516
and even once in this arena.

54:37.333 --> 54:39.225
So if you ask anything of the gods,

54:41.250 --> 54:42.683
ask for that same bravery.

54:42.958 --> 54:45.350
(dramatic music)

54:45.875 --> 54:47.225
Because Rome needs it now.

54:48.291 --> 54:51.058
(cheering)

55:10.333 --> 55:11.101
(cheering)

55:11.125 --> 55:12.350
From the South Gate,

55:13.458 --> 55:17.475
bakers from the
stable of Matronos of Vistrus.

55:26.791 --> 55:30.183
(cheering)

55:30.708 --> 55:36.058
From the stables of
Emperors Calicalla and Gator themselves,

55:36.875 --> 55:41.266
the undefeated
champion, Glissero the Destroyer.

55:43.166 --> 55:45.058
(explosions)

55:45.250 --> 55:50.351
(dramatic music)

55:50.375 --> 55:51.375
Oh!

55:52.916 --> 56:01.666
(cheering)

56:01.750 --> 56:02.267
(explosions)

56:02.291 --> 56:13.583
(cheering) (explosions)

56:14.250 --> 56:15.250
Oh!

56:17.125 --> 56:18.125
Help, Jesus!

56:19.458 --> 56:20.684
(explosions)

56:20.708 --> 56:25.558
(cheering)

56:31.000 --> 56:37.350
Hold together and when
the charges break for the wall.

56:38.166 --> 56:39.166
Why should I?

56:41.750 --> 56:45.808
(explosions) Hold, hold!

56:48.791 --> 56:49.791
Cows!

56:51.291 --> 57:00.333
(explosions)

57:00.375 --> 57:00.434
(cheering)

57:00.458 --> 57:06.684
(explosions)

57:06.708 --> 57:06.767
(yelling)

57:06.791 --> 57:08.142
(explosions)

57:08.166 --> 57:09.166
(groaning)

57:12.875 --> 57:24.041
(explosions)

57:24.125 --> 57:28.309
(yelling)

57:28.333 --> 57:31.976
(yelling)

57:32.000 --> 57:32.351
(explosions)

57:32.375 --> 57:33.101
(laughing)

57:33.125 --> 57:38.350
(growling)

57:43.250 --> 57:45.767
(cheering)

57:45.791 --> 57:47.851
(explosion)

57:47.875 --> 57:51.183
(growling)

58:12.875 --> 58:31.416
(explosions)

58:31.500 --> 58:34.767
(yelling)

58:34.791 --> 58:35.726
(explosions)

58:35.750 --> 58:48.791
(yelling) (yelling)

58:48.875 --> 58:51.559
(explosions)

58:51.583 --> 59:01.000
(yelling)

59:01.916 --> 59:04.350
Brother, is that poet, is it not?

59:05.833 --> 59:06.833
I can't remember.

59:07.916 --> 59:08.916
That night was a blur.

59:10.833 --> 59:13.600
The gates of hell are open night and day.

59:14.500 --> 59:16.266
Smooth as I forget.

59:17.333 --> 59:18.350
Smooth as the scent.

59:19.750 --> 59:20.808
Smooth as the scent.

59:22.208 --> 59:23.208
Easy as the way.

59:31.250 --> 59:32.250
Kill!

59:33.708 --> 59:34.708
(explosions)

59:40.125 --> 59:50.208
(yelling)

59:50.291 --> 59:52.892
(explosions)

59:52.916 --> 59:57.142
(yelling)

59:57.166 --> 01:00:01.184
(yelling)

01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:02.851
(yelling)

01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:05.809
(explosions)

01:00:05.833 --> 01:00:07.850
(yelling)

01:00:09.833 --> 01:00:13.391
(yelling)

01:00:14.041 --> 01:00:15.041
Brother.

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:18.141
(yelling)

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.250
You sit.

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.208
Shall we show mercy?

01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:23.041
Mercy.

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:27.142
(yelling)

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:31.350
(explosion)

01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:39.333
No mercy!

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:42.434
Your life has been spared by the gods.

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.266
I will sooner face your blade

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.266
than accept Roman mercy.

01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:54.142
(yelling)

01:00:54.166 --> 01:00:57.308
(explosion) (yelling)

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.351
Kill!

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:04.226
Kill!

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.142
Kill!

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:05.851
Kill!

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:06.726
Kill!

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.601
Kill!

01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:08.434
Kill!

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:09.267
Kill!

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:10.291
Kill!

01:01:13.958 --> 01:01:16.975
(yelling)

01:01:21.041 --> 01:01:21.101
(yelling)

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:26.641
(explosion)

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:44.183
(yelling)

01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:55.683
The road to freedom
doesn't run through the arena.

01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:58.250
Leads to this.

01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:04.541
Go to yourself.

01:02:06.166 --> 01:02:12.059
(yelling)

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:20.291
(panting)

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:30.350
Now let's go.

01:02:42.791 --> 01:02:44.267
(panting)

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:46.975
Gates of hell are open night and day.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.516
Smooth as the descent.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:51.683
Easiest away.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Dad, Dad.

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:02.183
And I bought you an
maximus, the single road.

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:21.458
(somber music)

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:23.558
It's got to end our gentle.

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:27.516
(explosion)

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:37.600
(somber music)

01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:39.208
Lucius is safe.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:53.416
(somber music)

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:57.934
Lucius.

01:03:57.958 --> 01:04:00.683
(somber music)

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.809
(somber music)

01:04:07.833 --> 01:04:10.433
(screaming)

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Lucius.

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:15.266
You're the sole heir to the throne now.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.141
There are men who want to
kill you so they can take power.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:25.100
I promise I'll bring
you back as soon as I'm safe.

01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:27.891
Mother, why can't you come with me?

01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:31.516
I have to stay here for your sake.

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:33.600
I'm here for the sake of room.

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:37.558
Remember who you are and that I love you.

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:40.391
I love you.

01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:42.708
Come.

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:46.750
Give me your leg.

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.141
Go, go.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.500
(screaming)

01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:58.351
So.

01:04:58.375 --> 01:04:59.808
(somber music)

01:05:01.916 --> 01:05:02.916
What's your name?

01:05:06.291 --> 01:05:07.291
I'm Ravi.

01:05:07.708 --> 01:05:08.708
I'm Doctor.

01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:13.517
Because more men die of infected wounds

01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:15.766
than out there in the arena.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.683
This needs to be
cleaned, needs to be stitched,

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.600
and it is going to hurt.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.766
This is devil's breath and opium.

01:05:27.833 --> 01:05:34.058
It's for the pain you should breathe in.

01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:40.058
I've been here so long now.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.683
They don't even notice anymore.

01:05:42.666 --> 01:05:44.850
I've done more
amputations than I can count.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:47.750
Where do you learn your trade?

01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:49.083
Why do you ask?

01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:50.350
You've got a heavy hand.

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:53.601
I used to be a gladiator myself.

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:54.625
Yeah.

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:58.516
What would you have
bested me in your prime course?

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:03.100
In your current
state, I could best you now.

01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:07.308
Luckily for you, I have put down my sword

01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:10.934
so now I spend my days saving lives

01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:12.891
instead of taking them.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.225
Why such a change so late in life?

01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:21.725
What we do in life echoes in eternity.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.350
I feel like I know those words.

01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:30.434
I can't take credit.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:32.266
It's written on one of the tombs.

01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:34.558
With the bones of a gladiator.

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:38.933
My champion, I smell devil's breath.

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:42.583
My.

01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:47.058
Champion, did you hear that crowd?

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:52.166
Did you hear that crowd?

01:06:54.625 --> 01:06:55.625
You have something.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.475
I knew it from the start.

01:06:57.916 --> 01:06:58.392
Did you now?

01:06:58.416 --> 01:07:06.391
Yes, the Greeks
call it thymos, smoke, rage.

01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:09.350
That rage is your gift.

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:14.891
Like the great Achilles, never let it go.

01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:19.725
It will carry you
to greatness, my champion.

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:28.934
(fire crackling)

01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:30.726
(screaming)

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:35.933
(growling)

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.475
Thank you for inviting me.

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.350
This is truly an honor.

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:49.891
(water splashing)

01:07:51.416 --> 01:07:53.433
I hear you are the talk of the court.

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:56.666
Yes.

01:07:57.625 --> 01:07:58.625
We met before.

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:00.476
Have we?

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.500
Long ago.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:04.250
Where?

01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:06.809
I was in the
service of your father's army

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.141
on this African campaign.

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:11.475
You served with my father.

01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:13.791
(groaning)

01:08:15.916 --> 01:08:16.916
Hmm.

01:08:18.166 --> 01:08:22.183
I had the privilege
of reading his meditations.

01:08:22.708 --> 01:08:23.708
Hmm.

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:30.809
The best revenge is to be unlike him

01:08:30.833 --> 01:08:32.266
who performed the injury.

01:08:35.458 --> 01:08:37.851
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:42.683
in the entire
empire, and here, now, in Rome,

01:08:43.625 --> 01:08:46.975
you're gaining
influence by sponsoring gladiators.

01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:49.058
I do it for the love of the sport.

01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:52.100
And where did you find these gladiators?

01:08:53.333 --> 01:08:58.225
They're usually
prisoners of war or vagrants.

01:08:58.708 --> 01:08:59.708
Why do you ask?

01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:06.434
A man can choose to fight and stay alive.

01:09:06.458 --> 01:09:08.725
It's the same in life as
it is in the arena, is it not?

01:09:12.958 --> 01:09:13.958
Who is this?

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.141
That is my father as a youth.

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:21.226
She had a child.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.250
Hmm.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.851
It's common
knowledge when comatose was killed,

01:09:25.875 --> 01:09:26.891
the boy disappeared.

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:27.642
Hmm.

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:28.666
Well, he would care.

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:29.916
Silla would care.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
More wine!

01:09:31.083 --> 01:09:32.083
More wine.

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:36.558
He was of the royal bloodline, after all.

01:09:39.083 --> 01:09:40.083
And his father?

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:41.750
Ostensibly.

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.250
Lucius Verus.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.975
You see, it was an arranged marriage.

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.183
She was 14.

01:09:49.583 --> 01:09:51.516
Females were not his taste.

01:09:51.708 --> 01:09:52.934
Not mine, some days.

01:09:52.958 --> 01:09:53.958
Not yours.

01:09:54.416 --> 01:09:54.601
(laughing)

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:55.517
No, no, no.

01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:58.475
By rumor, you see, she took lovers,

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:02.891
and by rumor, the
real father was comatose.

01:10:04.541 --> 01:10:05.766
Brotherly love, you see.

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:10.266
If he died, there has to be remains.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:14.600
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:17.266
Well, let's work it out.

01:10:17.333 --> 01:10:20.266
He was about 12 when he died.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:21.101
Yes.

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:23.725
So that would make him...

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:59.500
(dramatic music)

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:01.625
My lady.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:03.750
Crackers.

01:11:04.416 --> 01:11:05.101
Here's the cold.

01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:06.125
Thank you.

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:22.100
(dramatic music)

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.250
Gladiator.

01:11:27.625 --> 01:11:28.766
Do you know me?

01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:33.166
Hmm.

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:38.333
Do you have a family?

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:41.891
A wife?

01:11:43.625 --> 01:11:44.625
Arishat?

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:47.291
Arishat?

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:49.808
She was killed
under your husband's commands.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.684
For all drowns in its own blood.

01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:57.725
And yet you enjoy the
pleasures of the Colosseum.

01:11:59.291 --> 01:12:00.975
There's much you do not understand.

01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:09.100
(dramatic music)

01:12:09.583 --> 01:12:10.434
Duchess.

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:12.558
I do not know who you think I am.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.351
My name is Hano, and I have no mother

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:18.558
or none that I can remember.

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:23.250
(dramatic music)

01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:26.641
I'm so sorry.

01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:28.933
If you're somewhere here,

01:12:29.625 --> 01:12:31.266
I would tell you not to grieve him,

01:12:31.875 --> 01:12:33.892
for he would not be
the boy that you sent away.

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:35.558
That boy is dead.

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:39.683
You may think I have little worth.

01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:43.766
You may think I betrayed you.

01:12:45.625 --> 01:12:47.391
But I need you to know,

01:12:49.125 --> 01:12:51.350
if you will not have your mother's love

01:12:51.625 --> 01:12:54.600
and take your father's strength,

01:12:56.416 --> 01:12:57.416
you need it.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.016
His name was Maximus Decimus Mervidius.

01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:06.850
And I see him in you.

01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:08.291
Get out.

01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:12.600
My lady, we must go at once.

01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:17.850
It's just you were loved.

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:21.225
By myself and by your father.

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:25.183
Your name was on his lips.

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:26.458
Get out!

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:28.225
(dramatic music)

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:52.125
(dramatic music)

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Lucius is alive.

01:13:56.875 --> 01:13:57.875
Are you certain?

01:13:58.625 --> 01:13:59.625
Yes.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.141
I know my son.

01:14:05.625 --> 01:14:06.808
I spoke to him tonight.

01:14:10.625 --> 01:14:13.475
He may be lost to me for what I did.

01:14:15.291 --> 01:14:16.291
But he lives.

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.850
The third day of the games is tomorrow.

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:22.183
Most fighters won't survive.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:23.416
The cases.

01:14:24.916 --> 01:14:25.916
You must help him.

01:14:26.666 --> 01:14:28.350
Help him? Yes.

01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:33.683
I failed him then.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I know I did.

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:39.683
I cannot fail him now.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.266
The army is in Ostia.

01:14:44.791 --> 01:14:47.016
If we wait a few days.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.350
He could be dead by then.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.500
The cases.

01:14:53.166 --> 01:14:53.601
I would willingly give my life forever.

01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:55.891
Willingly give my life from...

01:14:57.625 --> 01:14:59.475
But I will not give my sons.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.666
One!

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:09.933
And two!

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:12.750
And one!

01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:15.208
And one!

01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:16.933
And one!

01:15:18.083 --> 01:15:19.083
And two!

01:15:20.166 --> 01:15:21.166
And two!

01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:23.041
And one!

01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:28.601
And one!

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:29.975
You won't get far like this.

01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:32.641
Just him.

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:34.250
You go.

01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:35.333
Go.

01:15:35.833 --> 01:15:38.725
Let's see how far you can
go on your own without your team.

01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:42.166
Ready?

01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:43.791
One!

01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:46.225
And two!

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.708
Diamond, diamond!

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:49.850
Come on, more!

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.500
More!

01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:14.725
Leave it.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.975
Just vinegar, my friend. Ah.

01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:41.350
There will be no more opium for you.

01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:47.058
There is plenty of pain
waiting for you in the next life.

01:16:54.958 --> 01:16:56.350
Are you a free man, Ravi?

01:16:57.375 --> 01:16:58.375
Free.

01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:01.208
I am.

01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:06.183
I laid down my sword and I
swore never to pick it up again.

01:17:06.333 --> 01:17:07.641
And yet you choose this home.

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:09.041
Mm-hmm.

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:10.766
What was your home before?

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:13.250
But I'm Asi.

01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:14.891
And why don't you go back?

01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:17.083
I wish I could.

01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:18.916
Asi.

01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:22.875
I met a woman.

01:17:24.625 --> 01:17:26.350
It's always a woman. Afterwards.

01:17:27.291 --> 01:17:29.683
She's from Lomdinium, Britannia.

01:17:31.666 --> 01:17:35.350
So now, our sons, they speak only Latin.

01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:38.725
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:42.458
We are Romans now.

01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:46.058
I grew up hearing
stories at my grandfather's knee.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.725
He used to talk the dream that was Rome.

01:17:52.625 --> 01:17:58.683
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it.

01:17:59.916 --> 01:18:00.916
Or it would vanish.

01:18:02.541 --> 01:18:03.541
So...

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:05.250
What was this dream?

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:09.683
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

01:18:11.375 --> 01:18:12.375
A Rome with the Senate.

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:15.875
A Rome with hope.

01:18:18.625 --> 01:18:20.725
Your grandfather, he sounds like a...

01:18:21.625 --> 01:18:23.933
Like a dangerous man.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.516
The odds are against you.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:34.225
The odds are always against me.

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:36.641
Don't worry old man.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:42.933
You should get some rest.

01:18:45.166 --> 01:18:46.725
Your men will need
you to lead them to me.

01:18:51.625 --> 01:19:02.541
[dramatic music]

01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:05.391
It's about survival!

01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:08.166
Survive!

01:19:08.333 --> 01:19:15.516
In the name of Poseidon, we
celebrate the glory of naval war.

01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:20.266
May your marches be
ready to listen for my command.

01:19:21.625 --> 01:19:23.391
We are together as cool as one, yes?

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:24.684
Yes!

01:19:24.708 --> 01:19:25.708
Yes!

01:19:26.708 --> 01:19:40.125
Today, we relive the Battle of Salamis!

01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:45.141
The Trojans versus the Persians!

01:19:45.625 --> 01:19:50.267
[crowd cheering]

01:19:50.291 --> 01:19:51.291
Pose out!

01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:53.601
And pull!

01:19:53.625 --> 01:19:54.625
Pull!

01:20:14.916 --> 01:20:15.916
Order on!

01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:17.625

01:20:49.625 --> 01:20:50.625
On time!

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:52.725
On time!

01:20:55.375 --> 01:20:56.600
Let's die! Ready?

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.266
And two more down!

01:20:59.833 --> 01:21:01.516
Push in! Push in!

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:03.683
Get down!

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.767
[explosions]

Pull!

01:21:25.833 --> 01:21:26.833
Pull!

01:21:27.625 --> 01:21:28.625
Don't shoot!

01:21:29.458 --> 01:21:30.458
Don't shoot!

01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:32.625
Pull!

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Pull!

01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:43.891
Ready to ram!

01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:47.291
And run!

01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:49.333
Freeze!

01:21:50.791 --> 01:21:52.975
[screaming]

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:57.725
Get him off!

01:22:27.916 --> 01:22:29.059
[screaming]

01:22:29.083 --> 01:22:30.083
Everybody, be free!

01:23:11.083 --> 01:23:12.850

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.642
[screaming]

01:23:16.666 --> 01:23:25.583
In the name of the
Emperor, the victor is...

01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:27.558
...Hanno!

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:41.141
Forget this!

01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:46.100
Who did this?

01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:48.041
It was me!

01:23:48.083 --> 01:23:48.976
I did it!

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I did it!

01:23:50.541 --> 01:23:51.725
[screaming]

01:23:55.916 --> 01:23:58.600
Gaeta will want
retribution for all of you.

01:23:59.041 --> 01:24:01.350
Did you learn to shoot the
same place you learned to recite poetry?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.891
Be glad it wasn't me or
that arrow would have found you.

01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:21.541
Be seated.

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:24.725
I have news for you.

01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:29.851
[music playing]

01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:30.975
He's here, sir.

01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:36.975
Oh, you're here.

01:24:39.083 --> 01:24:40.083
Back in the...

01:24:40.916 --> 01:24:41.916
...work.

01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:45.125
Yes, I'm listening.

01:24:46.541 --> 01:24:48.016
You know this is my house now.

01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:51.600
Your debt to me is over 10,000 denarii.

01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:52.601
You know that.

01:24:52.625 --> 01:24:57.308
I have other things. Cattle. Art!

01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:58.750
Truth, then.

01:24:59.416 --> 01:25:00.725
What do you want?

01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:02.850
Truth. That's what I want.

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:07.850
Nothing happens in
Rome without your knowledge.

01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:10.600
You have the senator's trust.

01:25:12.333 --> 01:25:13.600
You have Lucilla's trust.

01:25:14.625 --> 01:25:16.391
More importantly, you have my trust.

01:25:19.416 --> 01:25:22.808
You wish my loyalty.

01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:27.350
I own your house.

01:25:28.625 --> 01:25:30.308
I want your loyalty.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I...

01:25:37.416 --> 01:25:43.601
I have heard of a
plot to dethrone the emperors.

01:25:43.625 --> 01:25:44.625
Yes.

01:25:45.875 --> 01:25:47.225
But the plan has been delayed.

01:25:48.083 --> 01:25:51.891
Our gladiator is to be
rescued from the arena tonight.

01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:53.934
I know not one.

01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:55.308
I know why. I know who.

01:25:58.958 --> 01:25:59.958
Pac.

01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:03.725

01:28:12.041 --> 01:28:16.683
Thanks to the civic virtue
of men like Thrax and Macronus,

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:21.808
your insurrection has been revealed.

01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:31.350
The honor, the dignitas
that Rome has bestowed upon you,

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:35.850
all this you have
forfeited by your treachery.

01:28:36.291 --> 01:28:43.225
Please, the embracada, torture
me if you want, but do not lecture me.

01:28:43.375 --> 01:28:45.725
Your name will be forgotten!

01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:50.183
Lost to history!

01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:54.058
You are damned, Jimmy.

01:28:56.958 --> 01:28:57.684
You laugh.

01:28:57.708 --> 01:28:58.708
You damn me.

01:28:59.833 --> 01:29:00.833
I don't care.

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:05.100
Everything is forgotten in
time, empires fall, so do emperors.

01:29:05.416 --> 01:29:06.416
Why wait?

01:29:07.083 --> 01:29:08.083
I will guard him!

01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:12.975
Come, come!

01:29:13.958 --> 01:29:14.601
His death must be public.

01:29:14.625 --> 01:29:15.625
Public?

01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:21.850
Hang his entrails from
the city gates and crucify her!

01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:24.226
Crucify her!

01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:25.250
Take them away!

01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:43.725
Thank you, Macronus.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:29:54.625 --> 01:29:59.350
In these last days, I have
come to think of you not as a subject,

01:30:00.625 --> 01:30:01.850
but as a true friend.

01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:03.291
Thank you.

01:30:03.833 --> 01:30:08.683
Thank you so much, but as
a friend, I must counsel caution.

01:30:09.625 --> 01:30:11.683
Akatas is a hero of Rome,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.058
crucifixion is for thieves, Christians.

01:30:19.541 --> 01:30:20.351
He's too common.

01:30:20.375 --> 01:30:22.016
He is a traitor. He must die.

01:30:22.541 --> 01:30:23.541
I agree.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.308
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:36.725
Let the gods decide.

01:30:39.625 --> 01:30:44.100
You know, last night I
woke dreaming of the dark river.

01:30:46.458 --> 01:30:50.516
This time, the
first time, I was crossing it.

01:30:50.666 --> 01:30:53.766
You know where I come from?

01:30:55.208 --> 01:30:59.975
Crossing a river, it represents
forgiveness, it represents salvation.

01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:02.683
Oh, where I come from,
it means you're already dead.

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:06.308
As I saw it, I was not afraid.

01:31:06.916 --> 01:31:09.683
For someone who was
waiting for me on the other side.

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:35.750
Who is this man?

01:31:37.583 --> 01:31:39.016
Scratched out? I'm sorry. What the hell? Who is this man? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who is this
man? Who is this man? Who is this man? Who is this man? What is he? Who is this man? Scratched out.

01:31:40.333 --> 01:31:41.333
Maximus.

01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:46.308
I saw him fight once.

01:31:48.041 --> 01:31:49.041
He was magnificent.

01:31:49.666 --> 01:31:56.266
My time in the arena, it was after
his, but many still talked of him in with Faz.

01:31:57.041 --> 01:31:58.558
Spoke of him.

01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.250
What he did.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.250
I met him once.

01:32:04.791 --> 01:32:05.791
He was kind.

01:32:07.625 --> 01:32:11.391
He bowed to no one.

01:32:14.625 --> 01:32:15.625
Come with me.

01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:18.725
Come with me.

When a rebel
gladiator dies, we bury them.

01:32:42.125 --> 01:32:43.101
Here.

I gave him to you.

01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:29.625
You let him live.

And you got what you wanted.

I always get what I want.

01:42:32.625 --> 01:42:33.683
Why did you let him live?

01:42:34.625 --> 01:42:36.475
You bought a gladiator, not a slave.

01:42:38.916 --> 01:42:40.475
My will is my own.

01:42:42.625 --> 01:42:43.625
Ah.

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:45.891
How blue is your blood?

01:42:47.125 --> 01:42:50.766
Perhaps the heart of
a Roman beats in that chest.

The greatest temple
Rome ever built, the Colosseum,

01:43:02.333 --> 01:43:05.183
because this is
what they believe in, power.

They gather here to watch
the strong strike down of the...

01:43:09.333 --> 01:43:10.392
There has to be something else.

01:43:10.416 --> 01:43:11.226
There is nothing else.

01:43:11.250 --> 01:43:12.642
There has to be another Rome.

01:43:12.666 --> 01:43:13.850
There is no other Rome.

01:43:15.583 --> 01:43:16.583
The dream?

01:43:17.208 --> 01:43:18.208
The dream of Rome?

01:43:19.166 --> 01:43:20.516
It's an old man's fantasy.

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:23.641
Who are you?

01:43:25.791 --> 01:43:29.475
What was your name before
you traded it for a Roman one?

01:43:30.875 --> 01:43:32.016
You'll never know.

01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:36.250
I have a destiny.

01:43:40.416 --> 01:43:42.100
The gods delivered you to me.

01:43:44.625 --> 01:43:46.808
You will be my instrument.

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.725
I will never be your
instrument in this life for the next.

01:43:59.625 --> 01:44:01.350
That will not be my destiny.

01:44:04.333 --> 01:44:05.850
But I will see your end.

01:44:10.291 --> 01:44:26.916
What else could I do?

01:44:27.625 --> 01:44:30.809
He and his pigs were plotting to kill us.

01:44:30.833 --> 01:44:33.016
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads.

01:44:33.791 --> 01:44:36.559
The Platorians will put down
this crowd like they have every other.

01:44:36.583 --> 01:44:37.476
You brought this on us.

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:37.809
Shoo!

01:44:37.833 --> 01:44:50.625
Perhaps you should take
Dondys elsewhere to comfort him.

01:45:00.416 --> 01:45:01.933
Forgive my brother's outburst.

01:45:04.458 --> 01:45:07.225
The disease that infects
his loins has spread to his brain.

01:45:08.250 --> 01:45:09.350
Every day gets worse.

01:45:09.458 --> 01:45:10.725
I will reason with him.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.141
I see you.

01:45:31.208 --> 01:45:32.850
I see you.

01:45:34.208 --> 01:45:35.850
Gotta get on, gotta get on.

01:45:36.333 --> 01:45:37.350
Come on, stand up.

01:45:38.041 --> 01:45:39.433
Get up, get up, not you.

01:45:40.083 --> 01:45:41.266
All right, here you go.

01:45:43.625 --> 01:45:45.266
Now, listen to me.

01:45:46.541 --> 01:45:47.541
What's the matter?

01:45:48.333 --> 01:45:49.475
Nothing's ever mine.

01:45:50.541 --> 01:45:52.391
Everything is ours always.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.683
Even in the womb, you try it.

01:45:56.625 --> 01:46:02.350
Do I get my umbilicus so
that I couldn't have any more hair?

01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:03.850
You remember that, do you?

01:46:04.041 --> 01:46:05.017
Certainly.

01:46:05.041 --> 01:46:05.476
Sit.

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:06.600
One cannot forget.

01:46:07.083 --> 01:46:08.516
My conscience compels me.

01:46:09.541 --> 01:46:10.541
What?

01:46:11.333 --> 01:46:12.267
Sit.

01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:18.891
Your brother means to blame
you in front of the entire Senate.

01:46:19.625 --> 01:46:21.017
But I did not do it.

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:23.350
Well, what's
happening in the streets? The chaos.

01:46:24.083 --> 01:46:24.601
He's lying.

01:46:24.625 --> 01:46:30.266
No testimony can be more
damning than one brother against another.

01:46:30.958 --> 01:46:33.183
That's a lie. He always lies.

01:46:33.291 --> 01:46:34.975
He can be very persuasive.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.308
So, what will they do to me?

01:46:38.708 --> 01:46:40.683
I don't dare imagine, but imagine this.

01:46:41.416 --> 01:46:42.850
What will they do to Dondys?

01:46:46.625 --> 01:46:49.601
What will they do to Dondys?

01:46:49.625 --> 01:46:50.625
To Dondys?

01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:54.958
It's your decision.

01:47:19.625 --> 01:47:23.350
(Crowd cheers)

01:47:23.625 --> 01:47:26.058
Help me, young man!

01:47:32.791 --> 01:47:33.791
Brother.

01:47:36.625 --> 01:47:37.891
Put down the blade.

01:47:38.625 --> 01:47:39.683
You lie.

01:47:40.041 --> 01:47:40.726
Give it to me.

01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:41.976
You always lie.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.892
Give it to me.

01:47:44.916 --> 01:47:47.308
Look at me.

01:47:47.708 --> 01:47:48.601
Look at me.

01:47:48.625 --> 01:47:49.625
Lie!

01:47:49.791 --> 01:47:51.641
Let me break this spell.

01:47:51.958 --> 01:47:52.476
Lie!

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:53.500
Break this spell.

01:47:53.666 --> 01:47:55.392
I've always protected you.

01:47:55.416 --> 01:47:56.416
Because I love you.

01:47:57.666 --> 01:47:58.601
Come back.

01:47:58.625 --> 01:47:59.641
Help me.

01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:00.750
Help me.

01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:43.583
(Door opens)

01:48:43.666 --> 01:48:44.642
Doucheous.

01:48:44.666 --> 01:48:47.725
Never could have
imagined the fates would lead us here.

01:48:50.208 --> 01:48:51.850
And yet here we are.

01:48:53.875 --> 01:48:55.392
Everything has brought us full circle.

01:48:55.416 --> 01:48:57.308
You sent me away and you had fate.

01:48:58.583 --> 01:49:00.725
Brought me back to
the very ground where he died.

01:49:04.125 --> 01:49:07.891
This ring belonged to my father.

01:49:12.625 --> 01:49:16.725
He gave it to your
father, Maximus, as a token of trust.

01:49:19.083 --> 01:49:21.891
I gave it to Cacius for his valor.

01:49:26.625 --> 01:49:28.100
This ring belonged to my wife.

01:49:31.791 --> 01:49:33.100
I shall wear it next to yours.

01:49:33.625 --> 01:49:38.600
(Chuckles)

01:49:46.625 --> 01:49:49.141
I'm truly sorry for Cacius.

01:49:50.708 --> 01:49:53.350
I could not see the man.

01:49:55.625 --> 01:49:57.391
He was a soldier from...

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:00.601
There was a plan.

01:50:00.625 --> 01:50:06.266
He was readying troops at
Ostia under the command of Darius Cixtus.

01:50:07.666 --> 01:50:09.600
Troops he was to
lead against the emperors.

01:50:12.541 --> 01:50:16.225
Cacius, Maximus, Marcus Aurelius.

01:50:17.916 --> 01:50:19.391
They lived and died for Rome.

01:50:20.833 --> 01:50:21.833
We all do.

01:50:23.625 --> 01:50:25.683
Is it true they intend to kill you?

01:50:26.625 --> 01:50:33.558
One man or another has had a sword
against my neck since the day my father died.

01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:41.350
But now that I've
found you, it doesn't matter.

01:50:43.708 --> 01:50:44.708
I am not afraid.

01:50:45.083 --> 01:50:47.600
I've become well versed
in losing the things that I love.

01:50:49.666 --> 01:50:51.601
But now that I've found you,
I have no desire to lose you again.

01:50:51.625 --> 01:50:58.683
You stand like him.

01:51:00.541 --> 01:51:01.541
Alert.

01:51:02.708 --> 01:51:03.708
Proud.

01:51:05.958 --> 01:51:07.350
I do not have his strength.

01:51:08.166 --> 01:51:10.891
I wish that were true.

01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:15.183
I wish I were
telling you to free this place.

01:51:18.541 --> 01:51:18.601
(Door creaks)

01:51:18.625 --> 01:51:22.933
(Door creaks) (Door creaks)

01:51:23.625 --> 01:51:25.350
Go now.

01:51:34.375 --> 01:51:35.375
Strength and honor.

01:51:37.958 --> 01:51:38.958
Strength and honor.

01:51:40.916 --> 01:51:41.476
(Door creaks)

01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:42.500
(Door creaks)

01:51:48.625 --> 01:51:52.016
(Door creaks)

01:51:52.416 --> 01:51:59.309
As emperor, I have convened
the Senate to appoint my first consul

01:51:59.333 --> 01:52:03.017
and bestow upon
him the power to administer

01:52:03.041 --> 01:52:06.516
the military and
civic functions of the empire.

01:52:10.625 --> 01:52:15.225
I name Citizen Dardas!

01:52:15.625 --> 01:52:22.433
(Dardas creaks)

01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:23.850
Hail Dardas!

01:52:27.875 --> 01:52:29.266
Hail Dardas!

01:52:31.625 --> 01:52:33.101
Hail Dardas.

01:52:33.125 --> 01:52:34.125
Hail Dardas!

01:52:34.625 --> 01:52:35.625
Hail Dardas!

01:52:40.625 --> 01:52:42.350
As second consul,

01:52:44.833 --> 01:52:46.141
I name

01:52:48.625 --> 01:52:49.625
Citizen

01:52:51.625 --> 01:52:52.766
Macronus.

01:52:55.625 --> 01:52:57.683
Hail Macronus!

01:52:58.083 --> 01:52:59.308
Hail Macronus!

01:52:59.625 --> 01:53:00.850
Hail Macronus!

01:53:02.625 --> 01:53:04.891
There will be a
triumphal parade to celebrate.

01:53:05.666 --> 01:53:06.666
There will be games

01:53:08.625 --> 01:53:09.725
and mass executions.

01:53:13.291 --> 01:53:15.183
Long live the empire.

01:53:17.625 --> 01:53:18.625
Long live the empire.

01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:27.725
Sit down.

01:53:31.875 --> 01:53:34.350
I happen to have,

01:53:37.625 --> 01:53:41.183
with good fortune and not a little skill,

01:53:43.541 --> 01:53:45.933
the remaining emperors here.

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:54.725
I can speak logic to it.

01:54:00.625 --> 01:54:02.850
And tame the madness in the street.

01:54:03.041 --> 01:54:04.041
But,

01:54:06.375 --> 01:54:07.375
do we still order?

01:54:10.166 --> 01:54:11.166
I must have power

01:54:15.625 --> 01:54:19.850
and command over the Platorian army.

01:54:26.625 --> 01:54:27.625
Ballot?

01:54:30.166 --> 01:54:31.166
Or hand?

01:54:31.541 --> 01:54:34.641
(screams)

01:54:38.625 --> 01:54:40.391
Your humble servant.

01:54:43.625 --> 01:54:46.600
Put your hands down.

01:54:48.875 --> 01:54:49.875
You can sit down.

01:54:59.625 --> 01:55:00.725
So,

01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:02.308
I'm fine.

01:55:04.541 --> 01:55:05.558
Rome must fall.

01:55:08.625 --> 01:55:10.183
I need to only give it a push.

01:55:13.625 --> 01:55:15.391
And after Rome falls,

01:55:17.625 --> 01:55:18.766
what then?

01:55:21.625 --> 01:55:22.933
You are your father's child.

01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:27.601
His dream of Rome was never a dream.

01:55:27.625 --> 01:55:30.058
It was a fiction.

01:55:31.458 --> 01:55:37.391
The best revenge is to become
unlike the one who did the injury.

01:55:37.791 --> 01:55:42.266
I have made myself unlike your father.

01:55:43.041 --> 01:55:44.041
He spoke of dreams,

01:55:44.541 --> 01:55:45.641
I speak of truth,

01:55:46.083 --> 01:55:48.058
and the only truth in my Rome

01:55:49.625 --> 01:55:51.433
is the law of the strongest.

01:55:53.625 --> 01:55:54.642
I was owned

01:55:54.666 --> 01:55:58.266
by an emperor.

01:56:01.791 --> 01:56:03.391
Now I control an empire.

01:56:05.083 --> 01:56:07.766
Where else but in Rome can a man do that?

01:56:13.875 --> 01:56:17.641
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

01:56:20.625 --> 01:56:21.683
If there is anything,

01:56:23.125 --> 01:56:25.766
if there is anything you need,

01:56:27.916 --> 01:56:29.266
in these last hours,

01:56:30.625 --> 01:56:31.625
we will provide.

01:56:38.166 --> 01:56:40.808
Your death will
clear my path to the throne.

01:56:42.791 --> 01:56:45.225
Tomorrow, there will be games,

01:56:45.958 --> 01:56:46.958
and at them,

01:56:48.416 --> 01:56:49.416
I will prevail.

01:56:51.625 --> 01:57:04.083
Robbie!

01:57:06.166 --> 01:57:13.766
Can you get me a
message to Ostia by morning?

01:57:14.458 --> 01:57:15.458
What is it, Ostia?

01:57:15.791 --> 01:57:16.791
There is an army.

01:57:18.625 --> 01:57:21.476
I'm asking you to
risk yourself, my friend,

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:23.141
on the surface of something greater.

01:57:26.583 --> 01:57:27.583
Ride to Ostia.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.850
Take this ring to General
Darius Sextus, are you listening?

01:57:33.458 --> 01:57:34.891
Darius Sextus?

01:57:35.625 --> 01:57:37.558
You will know it as a caseus's ring.

01:57:41.625 --> 01:57:42.808
And, uh,

01:57:43.625 --> 01:57:45.016
who shall I say is

01:57:45.625 --> 01:57:46.725
sent me with this ring?

01:57:48.625 --> 01:57:52.933
I am Lucius Verus Eradius,

01:57:53.708 --> 01:57:55.766
the Prince of Rome.

01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:00.641
Tell him I am summoning the
army to the defense of a new republic.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:11.351
Should I trust you?

01:58:11.375 --> 01:58:11.809
Yes.

01:58:11.833 --> 01:58:12.601
Should I?

01:58:12.625 --> 01:58:13.625
Yes.

01:58:20.291 --> 01:58:22.308
Robbie, I need your keys.

01:58:28.625 --> 01:58:29.725
Thank you.

01:59:05.625 --> 01:59:06.625
No!

01:59:09.625 --> 01:59:10.625
Come back!

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Who gave you this?

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:44.601
Lucius Verus Eradius?

01:59:44.625 --> 01:59:45.725
The Prince of Rome?

02:00:41.833 --> 02:00:43.475
A street kill, Lucerne.

02:00:46.541 --> 02:00:49.600
Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

02:00:51.833 --> 02:00:52.833
Ever.

02:01:02.625 --> 02:01:06.391
If the people love her,
her death will incite the mob.

02:01:06.541 --> 02:01:09.100
If she dies and the
streets rise up in anger,

02:01:09.250 --> 02:01:10.892
I shall deliver them Caracalla's head,

02:01:10.916 --> 02:01:13.725
and the people shall
acclaim me that my friend is...

02:01:15.791 --> 02:01:19.183
Shall we?

02:01:19.333 --> 02:01:20.333
Yes.

02:01:22.708 --> 02:01:37.375
Today will be your last fight, Champion.

02:01:38.666 --> 02:01:40.683
And our master has bestowed on you.

02:01:43.041 --> 02:01:45.058
The wooden sword of freedom.

02:01:48.625 --> 02:01:50.433
But you have to earn it first.

02:01:51.541 --> 02:01:53.725
Today, you're
going to defend your mother.

02:02:11.958 --> 02:02:19.725
Would all steal a
point? There's still a point!

02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:47.683
Wait for me.

02:03:03.416 --> 02:03:13.000
In honor of the
acclimation of Emperor Caracalla,

02:03:13.625 --> 02:03:18.558
the first council, dondus
and second council, macronuts,

02:03:18.916 --> 02:03:23.683
and as punishment for her
conspiracy against the empire,

02:03:24.083 --> 02:03:28.350
for her calamities, against
the emperor's imperial bloodline,

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:31.226
and for fermenting military mutiny.

02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:35.851
Along with her husband,
the queen will face divine justice

02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:39.391
at the hands of the praetorian guard.

02:04:05.125 --> 02:04:11.058
I'm not a general,
but we are all soldiers.

02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:18.975
And up until now, we have fought for
nothing more than another day's survival.]

02:04:20.291 --> 02:04:21.308
What will you have us do?

02:04:23.041 --> 02:04:26.058
Well, you can return to yourselves
if you do not wish to fight this battle.

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:28.500
Or,

02:04:30.541 --> 02:04:31.558
you can join me

02:04:31.625 --> 02:04:35.558
and fight for a
freedom far beyond these walls.

02:04:36.083 --> 02:04:40.725
That once was a time when
honor meant something and road.

02:04:43.208 --> 02:04:47.516
In this road, I no
longer believe that exists.

02:04:47.791 --> 02:04:50.183
We must find it.

02:04:50.541 --> 02:04:58.141
And know this,
where death is, we are not.

02:05:01.333 --> 02:05:05.058
Where we are, death is not.

02:05:06.625 --> 02:05:09.141
By my sword.

02:05:12.458 --> 02:05:13.458
Strength another!

02:05:13.708 --> 02:05:14.708
Strength another!

02:05:15.625 --> 02:05:16.625
Strength another!

02:05:17.166 --> 02:05:18.183
Strength another!

02:05:35.625 --> 02:05:36.766
Get up, guys!

02:05:36.833 --> 02:05:48.541
Let it not be said that
the Emperor is not merciful.

02:05:49.708 --> 02:05:53.976
The Queen will be
granted a single gladiator

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.016
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

02:06:05.625 --> 02:06:10.558
The champion, Hano!

02:07:11.208 --> 02:07:30.541
The Queen will be
granted a single gladiator

02:07:30.625 --> 02:07:30.767
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

02:07:30.791 --> 02:07:33.100
Summon the
cavalry. Put this down at once.

02:07:33.625 --> 02:07:36.516
This is war! Real war!

02:07:40.125 --> 02:07:45.683
The army of Arces is
advancing just outside of Rome, sir.

02:07:47.625 --> 02:07:51.475
We can still out-flank them.
They have only 5,000 troops. No more.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.016
How many are we?

02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:56.350
6,000, perhaps more.

02:07:56.791 --> 02:07:57.933
Ride to the gate and hold them.

02:08:04.625 --> 02:08:15.250
They are barfing fire at their

02:08:45.958 --> 02:08:49.516
(yelling)

02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:50.766
Go, please, go!

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Delicious.

02:09:07.916 --> 02:09:08.916
Gimme the bowl.

02:09:22.125 --> 02:09:33.208
(yelling)

02:09:33.291 --> 02:09:34.291
Go, my son.

02:09:34.625 --> 02:09:35.625
Losers.

02:09:36.791 --> 02:09:37.791
Pause.

02:09:38.958 --> 02:09:40.100
(yelling)

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.184
(yelling)

02:09:51.208 --> 02:09:55.476
(yelling)

02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:56.975
(yelling)

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:40.708
(yelling)

02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:42.766
(yelling)

02:10:52.583 --> 02:11:00.391
(yelling)

02:11:10.583 --> 02:11:12.600
Will nothing kill this barbarian?

02:11:13.041 --> 02:11:14.975
Name is Lucius Ferris Aurelius.

02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:17.892
The man does not
become emperor by bloodline alone.

02:11:17.916 --> 02:11:21.101
He must be taken by
force and kept by force.

02:11:21.125 --> 02:11:22.350
Are you such a man as this?

02:11:22.458 --> 02:11:23.850
I don't fight for power.

02:11:24.791 --> 02:11:27.101
I fight to free Rome from men like you

02:11:27.125 --> 02:11:28.391
and to return it to them.

02:11:28.708 --> 02:11:31.475
The gods themselves want Rome reborn.

02:11:31.625 --> 02:11:34.266
They sent me to fulfill that task.

02:11:34.583 --> 02:11:38.141
And what if your
gods sent me here to kill you?

02:11:38.583 --> 02:11:39.351
(yelling)

02:11:39.375 --> 02:11:42.183
It's time to end this, Maconess.

02:11:42.791 --> 02:11:43.850
(yelling)

02:11:45.791 --> 02:11:59.083
(yelling)

02:11:59.166 --> 02:12:01.559
(yelling)

02:12:01.583 --> 02:12:20.125
(yelling) (yelling)

02:12:20.208 --> 02:12:28.666
(dramatic music)

02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:49.058
[screaming]

02:12:51.250 --> 02:12:53.266
Strengthen on her, myself.

02:12:56.666 --> 02:13:01.309
[grunting]

02:13:01.333 --> 02:13:04.559
[grunting]

02:13:04.583 --> 02:13:07.434
[screaming]

02:13:07.458 --> 02:13:40.916
[screaming] [gasping]

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:42.000
[grunting]

02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:46.850
[grunting]

02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:22.850
[grunting]

02:14:27.458 --> 02:14:28.975
You look to me to speak.

02:14:31.708 --> 02:14:35.100
I know not what to say other
than we have all known too much death.

02:14:36.666 --> 02:14:39.516
Let no more blood be
spilled in the name of tyranny.

02:14:39.833 --> 02:14:40.833
[screaming]

02:14:44.041 --> 02:14:49.933
My grandfather Marcus Aurelius
talked of the dream that would be roamed.

02:14:50.583 --> 02:14:57.433
A dream that my father,
Maximus Decimus Meridius, died for.

02:14:59.541 --> 02:15:00.541
An ideal.

02:15:03.708 --> 02:15:07.350
A city for the many
and a refuge for those in need.

02:15:08.041 --> 02:15:10.016
A home worth fighting for.

02:15:11.625 --> 02:15:15.600
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

02:15:18.208 --> 02:15:19.516
That dream is lost.

02:15:23.583 --> 02:15:25.809
But dare we...

02:15:25.833 --> 02:15:27.016
...dare we...

02:15:28.958 --> 02:15:31.391
...rebuild that dream together?

02:15:43.583 --> 02:15:44.641
What say you?

02:15:51.833 --> 02:15:52.833
Hey!

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.558
Hey!

02:15:56.583 --> 02:15:57.583
Hey!

02:15:59.291 --> 02:16:01.851
[screaming]

02:16:01.875 --> 02:16:02.517
Hey!

02:16:02.541 --> 02:16:03.541
Hey!

02:16:08.875 --> 02:17:07.250
[screaming] Mother.

02:17:56.333 --> 02:17:58.141
[Breathing heavily]

02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:02.141
Speak to me, Father.
