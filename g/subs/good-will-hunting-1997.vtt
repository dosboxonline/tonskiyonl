WEBVTT

03:34.395 --> 03:38.150
Mod f-x-square, d-x.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.753
So please finish
Percival for next time.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.391
I know many of you had
this as undergraduates,

03:45.452 --> 03:46.861
but it won't hurt to brush up.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.446
Thank you, Steven.

03:54.965 --> 03:57.130
I also put an advanced
Fourier system

03:57.460 --> 03:59.249
on the main hallway chalkboard.

03:59.725 --> 04:00.949
I'm hoping that one of you

04:01.010 --> 04:02.256
might prove it by the
end of the semester.

04:02.644 --> 04:05.372
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...

04:05.455 --> 04:07.794
but also go on to
fame and fortune...

04:08.198 --> 04:11.285
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

04:11.795 --> 04:14.269
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

04:14.795 --> 04:16.886
Former winners include
Nobel laureates,

04:16.947 --> 04:18.428
Field's medal winners...

04:18.781 --> 04:20.813
renowned astrophysicists

04:21.047 --> 04:22.897
and lowly M.I.T. professors.

04:23.986 --> 04:24.867
Well, that's all.

04:25.107 --> 04:26.580
If you have any questions...

04:26.770 --> 04:28.904
I'm sure that Tom
has the answers.

05:07.250 --> 05:07.929
Hi, Will.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.756
-Kirsten, how you doing?
-I'm all right. How are you?

05:09.991 --> 05:10.773
Good.

05:11.451 --> 05:12.987
I didn't get on
Cathy last night.

05:13.525 --> 05:14.391
-No?
-No.

05:14.452 --> 05:16.151
-Why not?
-I don't know.

05:16.477 --> 05:18.160
-Cathy!
-What?

05:18.367 --> 05:20.704
Why didn't you give me none of that
nasty little hoochie-woochie...

05:20.788 --> 05:23.123
-you usually throw at me?
-Oh, fuck you...

05:23.231 --> 05:25.585
and your Irish curse, Chuckie.

05:25.834 --> 05:28.115
Like I'd waste my
energy spreading my legs

05:28.176 --> 05:29.589
for that Tootsie Roll dick?

05:30.034 --> 05:33.051
-Go home and give it a tug yourself.
-Tootsie Roll!

05:33.134 --> 05:34.907
T-Toots!

05:35.882 --> 05:37.428
She's missing a tooth, Will.

05:38.697 --> 05:40.522
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

05:41.660 --> 05:43.984
Plus, it's like 5-to-2
Morgan ends up marrying her,

05:44.045 --> 05:44.640
you know what I mean?

05:44.701 --> 05:45.618
There's only so many times

05:45.712 --> 05:47.381
you can bang your
friend's future wife.

05:47.949 --> 05:48.855
It's wrong.

05:49.492 --> 05:50.284
Where you going?

05:50.345 --> 05:51.589
I'm gonna take off.

05:52.136 --> 05:54.857
Fuck you, you're taking off.
It's, like, what, 10:00?

05:54.918 --> 05:55.725
No, I'm tired.

05:59.410 --> 06:00.864
Irish curse?

06:01.258 --> 06:02.564
She don't know.

06:02.804 --> 06:04.349
There ain't no Irish curse.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.498
Out! Stop pressuring me back.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.879
Stop crowding the plate!

07:16.972 --> 07:18.210
Which one will it be?

07:21.531 --> 07:23.297
You're gonna get
charged, you know that?

07:23.381 --> 07:24.856
You think I'm afraid
of you, you big fuck?

07:24.988 --> 07:26.630
You're crowding
the fuckin' plate.

07:26.969 --> 07:30.920
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncing up
a bar at Harvard next week.

07:30.981 --> 07:31.732
We should go up there.

07:31.813 --> 07:33.008
What are we gonna do up there?

07:33.359 --> 07:34.093
I don't know.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.322
We'll fuck up some smart kids.

07:36.736 --> 07:38.130
Probably fit right in.

07:40.051 --> 07:42.470
Ow! Fuckin' punk.

07:43.488 --> 07:45.353
-Oh, what's up? You still tough?
-Come on!

07:46.825 --> 07:48.661
Come on. Come on. That's it.

07:59.296 --> 08:00.988
-Professor Lambeau?
-Yes?

08:01.124 --> 08:02.710
I'm in your applied
theories class.

08:02.771 --> 08:04.562
We're all up at the math
and science building.

08:04.950 --> 08:05.680
Come here.

08:06.663 --> 08:08.095
It's Saturday.

08:09.015 --> 08:10.619
Unless you wanna have a
drink with me tonight.

08:11.321 --> 08:12.115
Maybe.

08:12.518 --> 08:14.703
We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

08:15.163 --> 08:15.979
Find out what?

08:16.404 --> 08:17.527
Who proved the theorem.

08:40.341 --> 08:41.211
This is correct.

08:43.241 --> 08:44.110
Who did this?

08:44.740 --> 08:45.357
Jack?

08:45.900 --> 08:46.720
It wasn't me.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.186
Nemesh?

08:48.431 --> 08:49.312
N-No way.

08:53.494 --> 08:56.439
-Come on, Joey, now!
-Billy, McNamara's up.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.568
Come on, kid!

08:58.732 --> 09:01.029
-Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!
-Son of a bitch!

09:01.108 --> 09:02.210
Bring it down, Mac!

09:02.271 --> 09:04.556
That's how to do it! Attaboy!
Take two, Mac.

09:08.675 --> 09:09.531
Hey, Morgan,

09:09.934 --> 09:12.097
who's the girl with the striped pants?
She's got a nice ass.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.024
Yeah, that's a real nice ass.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.391
Who's the guy she's with?

09:15.845 --> 09:18.521
That fuckin' guinea. I hate that
little bitch. Will knows him.

09:18.925 --> 09:19.671
Yeah, I do.

09:20.134 --> 09:21.591
Yeah, fuckin'
Carmine Scarpaglia.

09:21.652 --> 09:23.392
That guy used to beat shit
out of me in kindergarten.

09:23.610 --> 09:24.625
-That guy?
-Yeah.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.200
Fuck this. Let's get some food.

09:29.362 --> 09:31.328
Oh, what, Morgan, you're
not gonna go talk to her?

09:31.568 --> 09:32.322
Fuck her.

09:33.249 --> 09:35.669
-I could go for a Whopper.
-Let's go to Kelly's.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.655
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's

09:37.716 --> 09:39.044
just 'cause you like
the take-out girl.

09:39.127 --> 09:40.349
It's 15 minutes out of our way.

09:40.685 --> 09:43.483
What the fuck we gonna do?
We can't spare 15 minutes.

09:46.272 --> 09:47.110
Double burger.

09:50.209 --> 09:51.049
Double burger.

09:52.561 --> 09:55.153
Chuck, I had a double burger.

09:55.214 --> 09:56.382
Would you shut the fuck up!

09:56.443 --> 09:57.648
I know what you ordered.
I was there.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.173
So give me my fuckin' sandwich.

09:59.234 --> 10:00.734
What do you mean, your sandwich?
I bought it.

10:01.765 --> 10:03.070
Morgan, how much
money you got on you?

10:03.131 --> 10:05.483
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.

10:05.544 --> 10:07.037
I said that when we pulled up.

10:07.098 --> 10:09.219
Give me my sandwich
and stop bein' a prick.

10:09.292 --> 10:11.372
All right, well, give
me your fuckin' 16 cents

10:11.456 --> 10:12.436
that you got on you now.

10:12.497 --> 10:14.027
We'll put your fuckin'
sandwich on lay-away.

10:14.291 --> 10:15.055
Here we go.

10:15.260 --> 10:16.627
Keep it right up here for ya.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.946
We'll put you on a program.

10:18.007 --> 10:19.324
Every day you come in
here with your six cents.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.221
At the end of the week,
you get your sandwich.

10:21.282 --> 10:22.592
Are you gonna be an ass hole?

10:22.675 --> 10:24.964
What am I, fuckin'
sandwich welfare?

10:25.025 --> 10:26.930
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

10:26.972 --> 10:29.766
Like how you bought your
couch-payment plans.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.641
Remember how your
mother brought in

10:31.702 --> 10:33.474
ten dollars every
day for a year.

10:33.535 --> 10:35.315
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Centre style.

10:35.376 --> 10:36.505
Can I have my food, please?

10:36.566 --> 10:37.879
Here's your fuckin'
double burger.

10:40.517 --> 10:42.655
-Whoa!
-Hey, hold up, Chuck.

10:42.739 --> 10:44.557
-Slow it down.
-Who do we got?

10:45.211 --> 10:46.891
-I don't know yet.
-Hey, douche bag!

10:48.048 --> 10:49.557
Yeah, you, you skank face!

10:49.618 --> 10:50.894
Shut the fuck up

10:51.917 --> 10:54.211
-Get outta here.
-What are you worried about?

10:54.417 --> 10:55.957
Why don't you lick
my love stick?

10:56.211 --> 10:58.018
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago.

10:58.079 --> 11:00.970
We should've fight him then.
We're eatin' our snacks now.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.046
-Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.
-I'm not goin'.

11:03.224 --> 11:03.721
So don't go.

11:03.782 --> 11:05.145
I'm not goin'.

11:05.559 --> 11:06.458
Fuckin' go, Morgan.

11:07.597 --> 11:08.596
Let me tell you somethin'.

11:08.657 --> 11:09.805
If you're not out there
in two fuckin' seconds,

11:09.866 --> 11:11.586
when I'm done with
them, you're next.

11:12.191 --> 11:14.031
Carmine, it's me. It's me, Will.

11:14.118 --> 11:15.906
Remember, we went to
kindergarten together.

11:30.468 --> 11:33.052
-Fuckin', let's go, man.
-Step on his fuckin' head.

11:33.423 --> 11:35.050
Get his ass on the ground.

11:36.002 --> 11:37.351
Stop that mother fucker.

11:43.939 --> 11:45.817
Mother fucker, die!

11:46.510 --> 11:48.274
-Carter!
-Come on!

12:00.910 --> 12:03.661
Will! Will, come on!

12:05.537 --> 12:07.645
Will, come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

12:09.484 --> 12:10.518
Easy, brother, easy.

12:10.586 --> 12:13.636
-Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.
-Come here!

12:14.498 --> 12:15.235
Whoa! Whoa!

12:22.280 --> 12:23.824
Ah. Fuck.

12:30.754 --> 12:32.267
Is it just my imagination,

12:32.328 --> 12:34.550
or has my class
grown considerably?

12:36.879 --> 12:38.450
Well, by no stretch
of my imagination...

12:38.533 --> 12:40.790
do I believe you've all come
here to hear me lecture.

12:41.109 --> 12:42.573
Rather, to ascertain
the identity

12:42.634 --> 12:44.672
of the mystery math magician.

12:46.371 --> 12:48.176
So without further
adieu, come forward,

12:48.237 --> 12:50.482
silent rogue, and
receive thy prize.

13:02.254 --> 13:04.879
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

13:06.001 --> 13:08.374
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

13:09.374 --> 13:12.545
However, uh, my colleagues
and I have conferred,

13:12.641 --> 13:15.228
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

13:15.732 --> 13:17.437
that took us more than
two years to prove.

13:18.927 --> 13:20.064
So let this be said:

13:20.900 --> 13:22.539
The gauntlet has
been thrown down,

13:22.729 --> 13:24.192
but the faculty have answered

13:24.475 --> 13:26.165
and answered with vigour.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.310
Hey, when's the arraignment?

13:41.686 --> 13:42.922
Next week.

14:10.628 --> 14:11.341
Sorry.

14:11.737 --> 14:12.559
What are you doing?

14:13.019 --> 14:13.559
Sorry.

14:14.912 --> 14:17.081
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

14:17.142 --> 14:19.758
-Don't you walk away from me!
-Hey, fuck you!

14:20.089 --> 14:22.294
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

14:45.750 --> 14:46.997
Oh, my God.

14:54.423 --> 14:55.367
Looks right.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.681
Will, how retarded do you gotta
be to get fired from that job?

15:14.778 --> 15:17.490
I mean, how hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around?

15:17.668 --> 15:19.970
Mitch, you got fired from
pushin' a fuckin' broom.

15:20.031 --> 15:22.129
I got fired 'cause
management was restructuring.

15:22.190 --> 15:23.864
Yeah, restructuring
the amount of retards

15:23.925 --> 15:24.901
they had workin' for 'em.

15:25.147 --> 15:27.188
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

15:27.249 --> 15:29.523
At least I got a motherfuckin'
job right now, don't I?

15:29.584 --> 15:30.283
Yeah.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.497
Why'd you get fired, Will?
Come on.

15:32.558 --> 15:34.133
Management was restructuring.

15:36.479 --> 15:38.452
My uncle could probably
get you on a demo team.

15:38.513 --> 15:38.982
Can he do that?

15:39.471 --> 15:40.259
You kiddin' me!

15:40.320 --> 15:41.779
I asked you yesterday
if I could get a job.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.653
And I told you 'no' yesterday.

15:44.462 --> 15:45.063
What's up, Casey?

15:45.124 --> 15:46.715
What's up, Case?
What's up, Big Case?

15:49.243 --> 15:50.149
Let's sit over here.

15:52.677 --> 15:53.843
All right. Let's go.

15:58.753 --> 15:59.798
Oh, this is...

16:00.416 --> 16:02.089
this is a Harvard bar, huh?

16:02.464 --> 16:05.169
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the wall.

16:06.887 --> 16:10.148
I will take a pitcher of the
finest lager in the house.

16:17.665 --> 16:18.458
Timeout.

16:18.956 --> 16:20.109
I'm gonna have to
bust a little move

16:20.170 --> 16:22.275
on them Harvard hotties
down there at the bar.

16:22.336 --> 16:23.247
Work some magic.

16:23.674 --> 16:24.753
Get some potion for us.

16:42.445 --> 16:43.844
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, hello.

16:44.001 --> 16:45.669
-Hi. How are ya?
-Fine.

16:46.165 --> 16:48.125
-So, do you ladies, uh...
-Come here often?

16:48.419 --> 16:50.060
Do I come here?
I come here a bit.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.887
I'm here, you know,
from time to time.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.249
-Do you go to school here?
-Yep.

16:55.775 --> 16:56.381
Yeah.

16:58.152 --> 16:59.219
That's it. I think I
had a class with you.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.523
Oh, yeah. What class?

17:01.491 --> 17:02.131
History.

17:02.424 --> 17:03.074
Maybe.

17:03.115 --> 17:05.021
Yes, I think that's what it was.

17:05.127 --> 17:06.380
You don't necessarily...

17:06.723 --> 17:08.775
may not remember me. You
know, I like it here.

17:08.872 --> 17:10.246
It doesn't mean
'cause I go here,

17:10.307 --> 17:12.601
I'm a genius. I am very smart.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.835
-Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
-Good. How ya doin'?

17:15.997 --> 17:17.905
What class did you say that was?

17:18.311 --> 17:19.762
-History.
-Yeah.

17:19.847 --> 17:21.039
Just history?

17:21.789 --> 17:23.454
It must have been a
survey course then.

17:23.516 --> 17:25.140
-Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
-Right.

17:25.231 --> 17:26.507
You should check it out.
It's a good course.

17:26.568 --> 17:27.494
It'd be a good class.

17:27.833 --> 17:28.930
How'd you like that course?

17:29.386 --> 17:31.264
You know, frankly,

17:31.325 --> 17:34.087
I found that class, you
know, rather elementary.

17:34.148 --> 17:34.983
Elementary.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.877
-You know, I don't doubt that it was.
-Yeah.

17:36.938 --> 17:37.675
I, uh,

17:38.821 --> 17:40.001
I remember that class.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.005
It was, um...

17:41.195 --> 17:43.767
it was just between
recess and lunch.

17:43.828 --> 17:46.438
Clark, why don't you go away?

17:46.598 --> 17:48.761
-Why don't you relax?
-Why don't you go away?

17:48.822 --> 17:50.410
I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
That's all.

17:50.471 --> 17:51.458
Are we gonna have a problem?

17:51.519 --> 17:53.557
No, no, no, no. There's
no problem here.

17:53.730 --> 17:56.282
I was just hoping you
might give me some insight

17:56.343 --> 18:00.245
into the evolution of the market
economy in the southern colonies.

18:00.700 --> 18:04.498
My contention is that prior
to the Revolutionary War,

18:05.092 --> 18:07.596
the economic
modalities, especially,

18:07.832 --> 18:09.397
in the southern colonies...

18:09.480 --> 18:12.108
could most aptly be
characterized as...

18:12.456 --> 18:14.110
-agrarian pre-capitalist.
-Let me tell you somethin'.

18:14.152 --> 18:15.416
Of course that's
your contention.

18:15.477 --> 18:16.586
You're a first-year
grad student.

18:16.647 --> 18:19.048
You just got finished readin'
some Marxian historian,

18:19.235 --> 18:20.327
Pete Garrison, probably...

18:20.388 --> 18:21.855
You're gonna be convinced
of that till next month

18:21.916 --> 18:22.911
when you get to James Lemon.

18:22.995 --> 18:24.107
Then you're gonna
be talkin' about

18:24.232 --> 18:26.041
how the economies of
Virginia and Pennsylvania...

18:26.147 --> 18:29.134
were entrepreneurial and
capitalist way back in 1740.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.496
That's gonna last
until next year.

18:30.557 --> 18:32.546
You're gonna be in here
regurgitatin' Gordon Wood,

18:32.817 --> 18:33.905
talkin' about, you know,

18:34.010 --> 18:35.843
the pre-revolutionary utopia...

18:35.904 --> 18:38.666
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

18:40.278 --> 18:41.624
Well, as a matter
of fact, I won't,

18:41.685 --> 18:44.472
because Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of...

18:44.533 --> 18:48.216
Wood drastically underestimates the
impact of social distinctions...

18:48.277 --> 18:50.766
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth.

18:51.526 --> 18:55.139
You got that from Vickers' Work
in Essex County. Page 98, right?

18:55.791 --> 18:56.724
I read that too.

18:56.817 --> 18:58.437
Were you gonna plagiarize
the whole thing for us?

18:58.534 --> 19:01.307
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?

19:02.352 --> 19:04.126
Or is that your thing?
You come into a bar.

19:04.187 --> 19:05.315
You read some obscure passage.

19:05.376 --> 19:07.704
Then pretend... pawn
it off as your own.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.448
As your own idea just
to impress some girls?

19:10.509 --> 19:11.687
Embarrass my friend?

19:13.400 --> 19:15.679
See, the sad thing about a
guy like you is, in 50 years,

19:15.762 --> 19:17.401
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.

19:17.462 --> 19:18.273
You're gonna come
up with the fact

19:18.334 --> 19:19.581
that there are two
certainties in life.

19:20.104 --> 19:21.496
One: Don't do that.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.356
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

19:25.417 --> 19:28.483
you could've got for $1.50 in late
charges at the public library.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.553
Yeah, but I will have a degree,

19:33.322 --> 19:35.032
and you'll be
servin' my kids fries

19:35.093 --> 19:37.405
at a drive through on
our way to a skiing trip.

19:38.662 --> 19:39.602
Maybe,

19:40.062 --> 19:41.665
but at least I
won't be unoriginal.

19:42.945 --> 19:44.319
If you have a problem with that,

19:44.380 --> 19:46.710
we could step outside.
We could figure it out.

19:47.630 --> 19:49.242
No, man, there's no problem.

19:50.974 --> 19:51.620
It's cool.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.114
-It's cool?
-Yeah.

19:53.175 --> 19:53.680
Cool.

19:54.817 --> 19:55.681
Damn right, it's cool.

19:55.764 --> 19:56.941
How do you like me now?

20:00.630 --> 20:02.272
My boy's wicked smart.

20:03.971 --> 20:06.053
I just spent three minutes
in this fuckin' place

20:06.114 --> 20:07.631
and run into a Barney, huh?

20:09.480 --> 20:10.356
There it is.

20:11.415 --> 20:13.334
-Nice to meet you.
-They were fine, man.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.340
I was gonna close
the deal, but then...

20:16.085 --> 20:17.922
Chuck... Billy, uh...
insulted one of 'em...

20:17.983 --> 20:20.630
The heavyset girl said I
had a receding hairline,

20:20.691 --> 20:21.863
and I was a few
pounds overweight.

20:21.924 --> 20:23.289
And I was, like,
'Go fuck yourself'.

20:25.380 --> 20:26.581
I swallowed a bug.

20:28.256 --> 20:28.917
Hi.

20:30.380 --> 20:31.853
You're an idiot.

20:32.430 --> 20:33.138
What?

20:33.221 --> 20:34.305
You're an idiot.

20:34.411 --> 20:36.022
I've been sitting over
there for 45 minutes...

20:36.083 --> 20:37.452
waiting for you to
come and talk to me.

20:37.744 --> 20:39.784
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.800
And... I couldn't sit there
anymore waiting for you.

20:43.089 --> 20:44.609
-I'm Will.
-Skylar.

20:44.839 --> 20:46.612
-Skylar.
-Oh, and by the way,

20:46.695 --> 20:47.686
that guy over there,

20:48.632 --> 20:49.823
Michael Bolton clone...

20:50.259 --> 20:52.034
He wasn't sitting
with us, so to speak.

20:52.203 --> 20:54.149
I know. I kinda got
that impression.

20:54.411 --> 20:55.455
Good. Okay.

20:55.813 --> 20:56.745
Well, I've got to go.

20:57.621 --> 21:00.053
Gotta get up early and
waste some more money

21:00.114 --> 21:01.627
on my overpriced education.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.907
-No, I didn't mean you.
-That's all right.

21:04.475 --> 21:05.375
There's my number.

21:05.928 --> 21:07.697
Maybe we can go out
for coffee sometime.

21:07.802 --> 21:08.456
All right, yeah.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.927
Maybe we can just get together
and eat a bunch of caramels.

21:11.943 --> 21:12.555
What do you mean?

21:12.649 --> 21:14.907
When you think about it, it's
as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.

21:15.907 --> 21:18.438
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

21:19.176 --> 21:20.840
Uh, right, then.

21:21.274 --> 21:22.479
Oh, come on.

21:23.100 --> 21:23.822
You're kidding.

21:28.548 --> 21:29.197
Yo!

21:29.258 --> 21:30.722
-Fuck you, bitch!
-Fuck you.

21:31.619 --> 21:33.092
There goes them fuckin' barneys

21:33.153 --> 21:34.933
-right now with his skiin' trip.
-Hold on.

21:35.132 --> 21:37.338
We should've beat
that old bitch's ass.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.709
Do you like apples?

21:48.519 --> 21:50.079
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

21:52.168 --> 21:53.462
Well, I got her number!

21:54.238 --> 21:55.439
How do you like them apples?

22:47.558 --> 22:48.448
Come.

22:53.782 --> 22:54.699
Excuse me?

22:55.215 --> 22:56.770
Is this the Buildings
and Grounds office?

22:57.785 --> 22:59.540
Yeah. What can I do for you?

22:59.860 --> 23:01.881
I just need the name of
a student who works here.

23:02.074 --> 23:03.446
No students work for me.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.534
Could you please check?

23:04.938 --> 23:06.218
I have this guy who
works in my building.

23:06.279 --> 23:08.588
-He's about this high.
-Which one is your building?

23:09.357 --> 23:11.280
-Two.
-Two. Building two.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.524
Look, if anything was stolen,
I should know about it.

23:19.624 --> 23:21.718
No, no, no. It's nothing like that.
I just need his name.

23:22.589 --> 23:24.892
I can't give you his name
unless you've a complaint.

23:25.815 --> 23:27.153
This is Professor Lambeau.

23:27.214 --> 23:28.748
And this is Professor Hayes.

23:28.891 --> 23:29.909
Tom, please.

23:33.545 --> 23:34.488
This is important.

23:35.332 --> 23:36.001
Please.

23:37.091 --> 23:38.858
Will didn't show for work today.

23:41.065 --> 23:43.301
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

23:43.660 --> 23:44.352
P.O.?

23:44.975 --> 23:46.793
Yeah, Parole Officer.

23:51.120 --> 23:51.845
Thank you.

23:54.764 --> 23:55.517
Ass hole.

23:58.578 --> 24:00.836
There is a lengthy
legal precedent,

24:00.897 --> 24:03.091
Your Honour, going back to 1789,

24:03.766 --> 24:05.929
whereby a defendant
can claim self-defence

24:05.990 --> 24:07.313
against an agent of
the government...

24:07.533 --> 24:09.899
if that act is deemed a
defence against tyranny,

24:09.980 --> 24:11.007
a defence of liberty.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.024
Your Honour,

24:12.346 --> 24:13.332
Henry Ward Beecher,

24:13.393 --> 24:16.101
in Proverbs from Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said

24:16.162 --> 24:18.303
-1887, this is the 20th century.
-Excuse me.

24:18.345 --> 24:19.391
He's gonna make a mockery
of the court room.

24:19.452 --> 24:21.966
I am afforded the right to
speak in my own defence, sir,

24:22.792 --> 24:24.761
by the Constitution
of the United States.

24:24.965 --> 24:26.235
Don't tell me about the
Constitution of the United States.

24:26.296 --> 24:27.294
This guarantees my liberty.

24:27.355 --> 24:30.004
'Liberty', in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

24:30.378 --> 24:32.729
When it cannot take a long
breath, laws are girded too tight.

24:32.790 --> 24:35.287
-Without liberty, man is a syncope.
-Man is a what?

24:35.560 --> 24:38.075
-Ibid., Your Honour.
-Son, my turn.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.499
I've been sitting here
for ten minutes now

24:40.560 --> 24:43.094
lookin' over this
rap sheet of yours.

24:43.241 --> 24:44.206
I just can't believe it.

24:44.822 --> 24:46.918
June '93, assault.

24:47.023 --> 24:49.109
September '93, assault.

24:49.324 --> 24:52.260
Grand theft auto,
February of '94.

24:52.975 --> 24:54.745
Where, apparently,
you defended yourself

24:55.148 --> 24:57.370
and had the case
thrown out by citing...

24:57.431 --> 25:01.539
'free property rights of
horse and carriage' from 1798.

25:01.726 --> 25:04.993
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

25:05.354 --> 25:08.997
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

25:09.734 --> 25:11.005
I'm also aware that you've been

25:11.066 --> 25:12.609
through several foster homes.

25:12.985 --> 25:14.615
The state removed you from three

25:14.676 --> 25:16.498
because of serious
physical abuse.

25:17.071 --> 25:18.483
You know, another
judge might care,

25:18.673 --> 25:19.802
but you hit a cop.

25:20.105 --> 25:21.342
You're going in.

25:21.594 --> 25:23.561
Motion to dismiss is denied.

25:23.848 --> 25:25.576
$50,000 bail.

25:26.063 --> 25:26.725
Thank you.

25:27.502 --> 25:28.615
Rise.

25:31.164 --> 25:33.065
-Hello?
-Uh, Skylar?

25:33.272 --> 25:35.270
-Yep.
-Hey, uh, it's Will.

25:35.695 --> 25:37.028
-Who?
-It's Will.

25:37.146 --> 25:38.071
You know, the really...

25:38.315 --> 25:40.198
funny, good-looking guy you
met at the bar the other night.

25:40.315 --> 25:42.781
I don't recall meeting anyone
who matches that description.

25:42.842 --> 25:43.910
I think I'd remember.

25:44.177 --> 25:45.361
Oh, all right, you got me.

25:45.422 --> 25:47.456
It's the ugly, obnoxious,
toothless loser...

25:47.540 --> 25:49.746
who got hammered and wouldn't
leave you alone all night.

25:49.807 --> 25:52.670
Oh, Will! I remember.

25:53.967 --> 25:54.811
How are you?

25:55.194 --> 25:56.417
I was wondering
if you'd call me.

25:56.705 --> 25:58.760
-Yeah, look, I was wondering...
-Yo, what's up, baby?

25:59.013 --> 26:00.431
-Hold on one second.
-What you doing?

26:00.883 --> 26:01.437
Hey.

26:01.503 --> 26:03.202
What's up baby?
Want some of my ass?

26:03.386 --> 26:06.165
Herve, I remember you from juvi.
How you doing?

26:06.385 --> 26:07.263
What you doing?

26:07.987 --> 26:09.145
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

26:09.408 --> 26:10.382
I was wonderin' maybe we could

26:10.443 --> 26:12.551
get together sometime this week.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.860
Sit out at a cafe. Maybe
have some caramels.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.671
-Oh, that sounds wonderful.
-Yeah?

26:17.265 --> 26:19.241
Yeah, sure. Where are you?

26:19.399 --> 26:22.811
Uh, well, actually, this is just
a shot in the dark, but, uh,

26:23.667 --> 26:26.384
there's no chance that
you're pre-law, is there?

26:30.629 --> 26:31.385
Have a seat.

26:31.938 --> 26:32.607
Thank you.

26:33.845 --> 26:35.129
Nice talking to ya.

26:37.676 --> 26:39.236
What the fuck do you want?

26:40.512 --> 26:41.792
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

26:43.467 --> 26:45.210
Professor you told
to fuck himself.

26:47.367 --> 26:48.633
Well, what the fuck do you want?

26:50.617 --> 26:52.071
I've spoken to the judge,

26:52.170 --> 26:53.588
and he's agreed to release you

26:53.792 --> 26:54.974
under my supervision.

26:55.493 --> 26:56.953
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.654
-Under two conditions.
-What are those?

27:05.064 --> 27:07.167
First condition is that you
meet with me every week.

27:07.753 --> 27:08.525
What for?

27:09.281 --> 27:11.090
Go over the proof
you're working on,

27:11.349 --> 27:12.180
get into some...

27:13.243 --> 27:14.561
more advanced...

27:16.012 --> 27:17.814
combinatorial mathematics,

27:19.763 --> 27:20.948
finite math.

27:23.186 --> 27:24.382
Sounds like a real hoot.

27:26.656 --> 27:28.498
And the second
condition is that...

27:30.086 --> 27:31.377
that you see a therapist.

27:36.130 --> 27:38.609
I'm responsible to submit
reports on those meetings.

27:39.966 --> 27:40.897
If you fail...

27:41.479 --> 27:42.981
to meet with any of
those conditions,

27:43.042 --> 27:44.418
you will have to serve time.

27:44.966 --> 27:46.059
All right. I'll do the math,

27:46.120 --> 27:48.106
but I'm not gonna meet
with any fuckin' therapist.

27:49.954 --> 27:52.568
It's better than spending
that time in jail, isn't it?

28:56.781 --> 28:59.450
I read your book, and 'Mike'

28:59.511 --> 29:01.976
was havin' the same problems...
that 'Chad',

29:02.069 --> 29:03.347
the stockbroker, was havin'.

29:03.433 --> 29:05.246
Absolutely right.
Right on the button.

29:05.307 --> 29:06.949
Good for you, Will. Very nice.

29:07.114 --> 29:07.659
Thank you.

29:08.260 --> 29:08.927
Will,

29:09.174 --> 29:11.552
the pressures, and
I'm not judging them.

29:11.613 --> 29:13.406
I'm not labelling them,

29:14.426 --> 29:17.473
but they are destroying
your potential.

29:18.079 --> 29:20.966
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery.

29:21.487 --> 29:22.621
No more ballyhoo.

29:22.901 --> 29:23.557
You're right.

29:25.773 --> 29:26.873
God, I know.

29:28.511 --> 29:30.443
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will,

29:30.689 --> 29:31.283
a bit more.

29:31.476 --> 29:33.631
Well, I mean, I do
do things, you know?

29:33.741 --> 29:35.416
What... what kind of things?

29:35.816 --> 29:39.082
I do things that, you know,
I mean, I hide from people.

29:39.762 --> 29:40.683
You hide, do you?

29:40.751 --> 29:43.836
No, no. I mean, I like. I go places.
I interact, you know.

29:44.425 --> 29:46.540
-Really? What sort of places?
-Just certain clubs.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.874
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?

29:48.935 --> 29:50.822
Like, uh, like Fantasy.

29:51.598 --> 29:54.043
Fantasy. That's
nice, a bit more.

29:54.216 --> 29:56.081
It's something like
when you get in there,

29:57.281 --> 29:58.636
the music, like, owns you.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.828
It's like that house music.
It's like...

30:03.904 --> 30:06.728
-You know, you start dancin'.
-Boom, boom, boom. Yeah.

30:06.789 --> 30:07.597
It's just...

30:10.062 --> 30:10.738
Yes.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.984
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?

30:17.311 --> 30:20.165
What are you talking about?
What?

30:20.226 --> 30:21.623
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,

30:21.684 --> 30:22.909
you were ready to
give me a jump.

30:22.970 --> 30:23.774
A jump?

30:24.189 --> 30:24.789
Are you...

30:26.180 --> 30:27.967
I'm terribly sorry
to disappoint you.

30:28.052 --> 30:29.635
Hey, I don't have
a problem with it.

30:29.773 --> 30:31.364
I don't care if you
putt from the rough.

30:31.425 --> 30:33.878
What are you...
putting from the rough?

30:33.939 --> 30:35.239
What on earth are
you talking about?

30:35.738 --> 30:39.661
A difficult theorem
could be like a symphony.

30:40.699 --> 30:41.546
It's very erotic.

30:42.989 --> 30:44.995
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

30:45.535 --> 30:47.645
-Wow.
-Thank you, Henry.

30:48.829 --> 30:49.816
Ah, Henry.

30:50.346 --> 30:51.540
Hi, Gerry.

30:51.624 --> 30:52.245
You know something?

30:52.306 --> 30:54.065
I can't do this pro
bono work anymore.

30:54.126 --> 30:56.630
-It's just not... it's not worth it.
-What happened?

30:57.030 --> 30:58.562
Well, I'm going on national
television next week.

30:58.623 --> 30:59.872
I mean, I haven't
got time to tell you,

30:59.933 --> 31:02.187
much less talk to that
raving looney in there.

31:02.368 --> 31:03.643
An absolute lunatic, he is.

31:05.393 --> 31:06.176
Henry.

31:07.934 --> 31:10.406
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.

31:10.687 --> 31:11.382
Now,

31:12.308 --> 31:14.026
how old are you?

31:15.560 --> 31:16.290
Seven.

31:17.551 --> 31:19.108
What do you see?

31:21.391 --> 31:22.775
Some things in my room.

31:23.710 --> 31:24.670
What is it?

31:26.913 --> 31:30.772
It's like a... it's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.

31:31.710 --> 31:33.768
You are in a safe place, Will.

31:35.339 --> 31:36.402
It's t...

31:37.653 --> 31:38.622
it's touchin' me.

31:39.879 --> 31:41.272
Where is it touching you?

31:41.840 --> 31:43.285
It's touching me down there,

31:46.082 --> 31:47.922
and I'm nervous.

31:48.729 --> 31:50.497
You don't have to
be nervous, Will.

31:51.940 --> 31:52.623
We...

31:53.636 --> 31:57.393
start dancin' and dancin'.
It's just beautiful,

31:57.837 --> 31:58.796
'cause we...

31:59.448 --> 32:04.664
can make... a lot of love
before the sun goes down.

32:19.829 --> 32:22.769
-I'm sorry, Rich.
-I have better things to do with my time.

32:24.270 --> 32:27.021
Hey. Afternoon delight.
Come on! One dance!

32:27.487 --> 32:29.333
You really hypnotized
me, you know?

32:29.861 --> 32:30.745
For God's sake, Will.

32:30.955 --> 32:32.075
What? Oh, come on.

32:32.198 --> 32:34.113
He left. You can't
pin that on me.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.448
I told you to cooperate
with these people.

32:36.830 --> 32:39.618
-Look... into my eyes.
-Get out, Will.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.042
I don't need therapy.

32:42.103 --> 32:43.282
That's enough. Get out!

32:46.209 --> 32:47.798
I called Mel Weintraub
this morning to see...

32:47.859 --> 32:48.906
Oh, what's the use?

32:50.416 --> 32:51.332
What do you want to do?

32:56.941 --> 32:58.773
-Well, there's someone.
-Who is he?

32:59.098 --> 33:00.369
He used to be my, uh...

33:02.436 --> 33:03.961
my room-mate in college.

33:08.353 --> 33:09.180
Trust.

33:09.733 --> 33:11.125
Very important...

33:11.417 --> 33:14.072
in a relationship. It's also very
important in a clinical situation.

33:14.155 --> 33:16.686
Why is trust the most
important thing...

33:17.134 --> 33:19.577
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

33:22.237 --> 33:25.600
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

33:26.673 --> 33:27.210
Vinnie.

33:28.399 --> 33:29.107
Um...

33:30.087 --> 33:31.308
Because, uh...

33:33.004 --> 33:34.394
Trust is, uh...

33:34.906 --> 33:36.007
trust is life.

33:36.341 --> 33:37.027
Wow.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.470
That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

33:39.689 --> 33:41.516
Next time, get the
notes from your brother.

33:42.486 --> 33:44.547
If a patient doesn't feel
safe enough trust you,

33:44.608 --> 33:45.876
then they won't be
honest with you.

33:46.013 --> 33:48.027
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.556
I mean, hey, if they
don't trust you,

33:49.734 --> 33:51.725
you're never gonna get
them to sleep with you.

33:51.786 --> 33:53.111
That should be the goal
of any good therapist.

33:53.487 --> 33:54.850
Nail 'em while
they're vulnerable.

33:54.911 --> 33:55.642
That's my motto.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.816
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

34:01.193 --> 34:01.973
Hello, Sean.

34:04.487 --> 34:05.113
Hey, Gerry.

34:07.155 --> 34:07.755
Um,

34:08.887 --> 34:09.841
ladies and gentlemen,

34:10.348 --> 34:12.053
we are in the
presence of greatness.

34:12.136 --> 34:13.723
Professor Gerald Lambeau,

34:13.850 --> 34:16.141
Field's medal winner for
combinatorial mathematics.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.092
Hello.

34:17.312 --> 34:18.808
Anyone know what the
Field's medal is?

34:19.061 --> 34:20.119
It's a really big deal.

34:20.179 --> 34:21.855
It's like the Nobel
prize for math.

34:22.447 --> 34:24.456
Except they only give it
out once every four years.

34:25.887 --> 34:26.985
It's a great thing.

34:27.632 --> 34:28.472
It's an amazing honour.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.275
Okay, everybody,
that's it for today.

34:30.337 --> 34:32.100
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.

34:32.815 --> 34:33.976
We'll be talking about Freud.

34:34.036 --> 34:35.974
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse.

34:36.034 --> 34:36.817
Thank you.

34:39.096 --> 34:39.969
How are you?

34:40.722 --> 34:41.868
It's good to see you.

34:41.942 --> 34:43.235
Good to see you.

34:43.536 --> 34:44.464
-Sean?
-Yeah?

34:44.667 --> 34:46.322
I think I got something
interesting for ya.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.629
What, you have to have blood in urine?
What's up?

34:50.572 --> 34:52.222
Why didn't you come
to the reunion?

34:52.672 --> 34:53.492
You know, I'm...

34:54.078 --> 34:54.851
I've been busy.

34:55.851 --> 34:56.721
You were missed.

34:57.107 --> 34:57.770
Really?

34:58.025 --> 34:59.949
So how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

35:01.301 --> 35:02.502
Before Nancy died.

35:02.855 --> 35:03.879
Yeah, I'm sorry.

35:04.708 --> 35:05.875
I was in Paris.

35:06.081 --> 35:06.998
It was that damn conference.

35:07.059 --> 35:08.826
I got your card. It was nice.

35:14.235 --> 35:16.557
-Come here.
-Now that's a take-down.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.085
Hey, what happened?

35:18.190 --> 35:19.846
Did you get leniency or what?

35:20.169 --> 35:21.116
I got, uh,

35:21.314 --> 35:24.135
probation and then
counselling two days a week.

35:25.157 --> 35:25.904
Joke.

35:26.182 --> 35:28.848
You're a smoothie. Come on, Morgan!
Just submit!

35:30.197 --> 35:31.113
Hey, Bill, just...

35:31.174 --> 35:32.872
just get off him. We're
gonna miss the game.

35:33.121 --> 35:34.979
-I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
-Sean, Sean.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.892
This...this boy is incredible.

35:36.953 --> 35:38.023
I've never seen
anything like him.

35:38.294 --> 35:40.177
What makes him so
incredible, Gerry?

35:41.526 --> 35:42.996
You ever heard of Ramanujan?

35:43.057 --> 35:44.120
Yeah, yeah.

35:45.368 --> 35:45.772
No.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.214
It's a man.

35:48.172 --> 35:50.701
He lived over 100 years ago.
He was Indian.

35:51.335 --> 35:53.312
-Dots, not feathers.
-Not feathers. Yeah.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.716
He lived in this tiny
hut somewhere in India.

35:55.817 --> 35:57.643
He had no formal education.

35:58.035 --> 36:00.223
-He had no access to any scientific work.
-Coffee?

36:00.547 --> 36:01.568
-You, sir?
-Just a little.

36:02.841 --> 36:04.846
But he came across
this old math book,

36:05.345 --> 36:06.417
and from the simple text,

36:06.478 --> 36:08.111
he was able to
extrapolate theories...

36:08.172 --> 36:09.974
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.

36:10.016 --> 36:11.552
Yes. Continued fractions.

36:11.782 --> 36:13.144
He wrote, uh...

36:13.328 --> 36:15.302
Well, he mailed it to
Hardy at Cambridge.

36:15.363 --> 36:16.812
Yeah, Cambridge, yeah.

36:17.358 --> 36:20.275
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

36:20.345 --> 36:21.875
And brought him over to England,

36:22.139 --> 36:24.172
and then they worked
together for years,

36:24.406 --> 36:27.292
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

36:28.025 --> 36:29.329
This... this Ramanujan...

36:29.371 --> 36:32.362
his... his genius was
unparalleled, Sean.

36:33.888 --> 36:35.403
Well, this boy's just like that.

36:37.115 --> 36:39.400
But he's... he's
a bit defensive.

36:40.756 --> 36:42.867
I need someone who can
get through to him.

36:44.013 --> 36:44.687
Like me?

36:45.460 --> 36:46.181
Yeah, like you.

36:46.884 --> 36:47.358
Why?

36:47.654 --> 36:49.351
Well, because you have the
same kind of background.

36:49.739 --> 36:50.494
What background?

36:50.930 --> 36:52.243
Well, you're from the
same neighbourhood.

36:52.940 --> 36:53.930
He's from Southie?

36:54.024 --> 36:54.846
Yeah.

36:55.703 --> 36:57.065
Boy genius from Southie.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.005
How many shrinks
you go to before me?

37:02.538 --> 37:03.199
Five.

37:04.494 --> 37:06.414
-Let me guess. Barry?
-Yeah.

37:06.475 --> 37:07.349
-Henry?
-Yeah.

37:07.416 --> 37:08.703
-Not Rick?
-Sean, please...

37:09.149 --> 37:11.021
, just meet with
him once a week.

37:11.662 --> 37:12.427
Please?

37:15.823 --> 37:17.599
It's a poker game with this kid.

37:17.863 --> 37:19.116
Don't let him know
what you've got.

37:19.558 --> 37:21.227
He probably even read your book,

37:21.479 --> 37:22.303
if he could find it.

37:22.460 --> 37:23.631
It's gonna be hard
for him to find.

37:24.848 --> 37:25.915
-Hi, Will.
-Hi.

37:26.350 --> 37:27.681
This is Sean Maguire.

37:27.868 --> 37:28.661
Will Hunting.

37:28.771 --> 37:29.445
How are ya?

37:34.948 --> 37:36.130
Yeah. Let's get started.

37:36.191 --> 37:37.507
Yeah, let's do it. I'm pumped.

37:38.054 --> 37:39.309
Let's let the healing begin.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.001
Will you excuse us?

37:41.577 --> 37:42.409
Yeah, please, Tom.

37:42.718 --> 37:43.553
You, too, Gerry.

37:46.016 --> 37:47.132
Yeah, of course.

37:52.776 --> 37:53.442
How are you?

37:56.646 --> 37:57.789
Where you from in Southie?

37:58.886 --> 38:00.134
I like what you've
done with the place.

38:00.497 --> 38:01.354
Oh, thanks.

38:01.957 --> 38:04.170
Do you buy all
these books retail,

38:04.231 --> 38:06.083
or do you send away for,
like, a 'shrink kit'

38:06.144 --> 38:08.152
that comes with all
these volumes included?

38:08.428 --> 38:09.401
Do you like books?

38:10.659 --> 38:11.267
Yeah.

38:12.043 --> 38:14.017
-Did you read any of these books?
-I don't know.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.908
How about any of these books?

38:16.312 --> 38:17.255
Probably not.

38:17.316 --> 38:19.241
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

38:21.135 --> 38:22.885
-Yeah, I read those.
-Good for you.

38:23.935 --> 38:24.747
What do you think about 'em?

38:24.939 --> 38:26.658
I'm not here for a
fuckin' book report.

38:26.719 --> 38:27.946
They're your books.
Why don't you read 'em?

38:28.259 --> 38:29.586
I did. I had to.

38:30.301 --> 38:31.795
Must've taken you a long time.

38:32.178 --> 38:33.065
Yeah, it did.

38:39.990 --> 38:42.533
United States of America:
A Complete History,

38:43.113 --> 38:44.193
Volume I.

38:55.428 --> 38:56.259
Jesus.

38:57.522 --> 38:58.846
If you wanna read a
real history book,

38:58.907 --> 39:01.080
read Howard Zinn's A People's
History in the United States.

39:01.141 --> 39:02.908
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.

39:02.969 --> 39:04.986
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

39:05.047 --> 39:06.026
Do you think that's a good book?

39:06.344 --> 39:07.776
You fuckin' people baffle me.

39:09.672 --> 39:12.041
You spend all your money on
these fuckin' fancy books.

39:12.102 --> 39:13.315
You surround
yourselves with 'em.

39:13.406 --> 39:14.562
They're the wrong fuckin' books.

39:14.623 --> 39:16.336
What are the right
fuckin' books, Will?

39:16.977 --> 39:18.705
Whatever blows your hair back.

39:19.631 --> 39:20.845
Yeah. Haven't got
much hair left.

39:21.458 --> 39:23.396
Hey, you know you'd be
better shoving that cigarette

39:23.457 --> 39:24.994
up your ass. It'd probably
be healthier for you.

39:25.593 --> 39:27.526
Yeah, I know. It really
gets in the way of my yoga.

39:28.939 --> 39:29.911
-You work out, huh?

39:30.625 --> 39:31.268
What, you lift?

39:31.731 --> 39:32.324
Yeah.

39:32.741 --> 39:33.648
Nautilus?

39:33.927 --> 39:34.673
No, free weights.

39:34.977 --> 39:37.488
-Oh, really? Free weights, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah, big time.

39:37.601 --> 39:38.630
-Yeah?
-Just like that.

39:38.691 --> 39:40.964
-What do you bench?
-285. What do you bench?

39:43.243 --> 39:44.002
You paint that?

39:45.294 --> 39:46.768
-Yeah.
-Do you paint?

39:47.714 --> 39:48.455
Do you sculpt?

39:49.817 --> 39:50.200
No.

39:50.350 --> 39:51.202
Do you like art?

39:52.955 --> 39:53.790
Do you like music?

39:55.560 --> 39:56.847
This is a real piece of shit.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.515
Oh, tell me what
you really think.

39:59.678 --> 40:00.496
I don't know. Just the...

40:01.130 --> 40:03.149
linear and impressionistic mix

40:03.210 --> 40:05.150
makes a very
muddled composition.

40:05.427 --> 40:06.991
It's also a Winslow
Homer rip-off,

40:07.052 --> 40:09.250
except you got whitey
rowin' the boat there.

40:09.529 --> 40:11.380
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

40:11.441 --> 40:12.874
That's not really what
concerns me though.

40:12.935 --> 40:14.015
What concerns you?

40:14.145 --> 40:16.147
-Just the colouring.
-You know what the real bitch of it is?

40:16.610 --> 40:17.700
It's paint-by-number.

40:18.825 --> 40:19.921
Is it colour-by-number?

40:19.982 --> 40:21.243
Because the colours
are fascinating to me.

40:21.304 --> 40:22.752
-Aren't they really?
-You bet.

40:22.908 --> 40:24.348
I think you're
about one step away

40:24.409 --> 40:25.670
from cuttin' your
fuckin' ear off.

40:26.216 --> 40:26.680
Really?

40:27.100 --> 40:27.861
Oh, yeah.

40:28.231 --> 40:29.856
Think I should move to
the south of France,

40:29.917 --> 40:31.097
change my name to 'Vincent'?

40:32.251 --> 40:34.058
You ever heard the sayin',
'any port in a storm'?

40:34.172 --> 40:34.791
Yeah.

40:35.604 --> 40:36.882
Yeah, maybe that means you.

40:37.315 --> 40:38.149
In what way?

40:38.518 --> 40:41.380
Maybe you're in the middle of
a storm, a big fuckin' storm.

40:41.441 --> 40:42.380
Yeah, maybe.

40:42.441 --> 40:43.520
The sky's fallin' on your head.

40:43.581 --> 40:45.133
The waves are crashin'
over your little boat.

40:45.194 --> 40:46.643
The oars are about to snap.

40:47.548 --> 40:49.464
You just piss in your pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

40:49.525 --> 40:51.286
So maybe you do what
you gotta do to get out.

40:51.742 --> 40:53.363
You know, maybe you
became a psychologist.

40:54.220 --> 40:55.607
Bingo. That's it.

40:55.894 --> 40:58.057
Let me do my job now. You
start with me. Come on.

41:00.177 --> 41:01.579
Maybe you married
the wrong woman.

41:01.717 --> 41:03.060
Maybe you should
watch your mouth!

41:05.517 --> 41:06.906
Watch it right there,
chief, all right?

41:10.670 --> 41:11.398
Ah.

41:16.509 --> 41:17.742
That's it, isn't it?

41:19.150 --> 41:20.467
You married the wrong woman.

41:22.771 --> 41:23.461
What happened?

41:25.997 --> 41:26.948
What, did she leave you?

41:27.405 --> 41:29.651
Was she, you know...
banging some other guy?

41:32.078 --> 41:34.831
If you ever disrespect my
wife again, I will end you.

41:35.386 --> 41:36.541
I will fuckin' end you.

41:37.688 --> 41:38.588
Got that, chief?

41:41.361 --> 41:42.115
Time's up.

41:43.437 --> 41:44.201
Yeah.

41:58.324 --> 41:59.563
At ease, gentlemen.

42:06.321 --> 42:07.165
You okay?

42:13.792 --> 42:16.123
Look, I'll understand if you
don't wanna meet with him again.

42:17.615 --> 42:20.384
Thursday, 4:00. Make
sure the kid's here.

42:23.470 --> 42:24.170
Yeah.

42:25.951 --> 42:26.614
Thanks.

43:32.957 --> 43:35.237
Well, you look lovely
in those glasses.

43:35.336 --> 43:37.075
-Thank you very much.
-They're just beautiful.

43:37.136 --> 43:39.183
Yes, I always wanted
dark blue eye shadow.

43:39.244 --> 43:40.472
Wonderful.

43:43.807 --> 43:45.197
Growing up in England, you know,

43:45.258 --> 43:46.541
I went to a very nice school.

43:46.973 --> 43:48.332
You know, it was kind of...

43:48.606 --> 43:50.138
progressive, organic,

43:50.355 --> 43:52.619
do-it-yourself, private school.

43:52.953 --> 43:53.908
Then Harvard.

43:54.875 --> 43:56.091
Hopefully med school.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.384
You know, I figured
out, by the end,

43:58.955 --> 44:02.091
my brain's gonna
be worth $250,000.

44:03.633 --> 44:04.960
That sounded
horrible, didn't it?

44:07.755 --> 44:10.128
Bring me another mai tai!

44:10.795 --> 44:11.523
Yeah, that's cool.

44:11.584 --> 44:13.457
I mean, I bet your
parents were happy to pay.

44:13.869 --> 44:16.320
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

44:17.930 --> 44:18.650
Wow.

44:19.190 --> 44:21.241
Is Harvard gettin'
all that money?

44:21.488 --> 44:24.219
No, Stanford. I'm going there
in June when I graduate.

44:24.531 --> 44:26.529
All right, so you
just wanted to use

44:26.590 --> 44:28.594
this sailor and
then run away, huh?

44:28.934 --> 44:30.143
Well, I was gonna, you know,

44:30.204 --> 44:32.874
experiment on you for anatomy
class first, obviously.

44:32.935 --> 44:34.191
In that case, that's fine.

44:35.455 --> 44:37.408
Hey, you wanna see my
magic tricks, Skylar?

44:37.469 --> 44:38.089
Of course.

44:38.130 --> 44:39.042
All right.

44:39.446 --> 44:40.760
Promise to...

44:41.458 --> 44:42.191
All right.

44:44.085 --> 44:45.331
This one's for you, Rudolph.

44:45.731 --> 44:47.282
Wait, wait. You need my wand.

44:47.598 --> 44:48.685
All right, give me a hit.

44:49.236 --> 44:50.334
Thank you. All right.

44:50.477 --> 44:52.188
I'm gonna make all these
caramels disappear.

44:52.649 --> 44:53.428
You ready?

44:54.188 --> 44:54.915
Ready.

44:55.330 --> 44:56.145
One,

44:56.616 --> 44:57.174
two,

44:57.543 --> 44:58.239
three.

44:59.297 --> 45:00.278
They're all gone.

45:00.998 --> 45:03.542
That was my... It works
better when I have my rabbit.

45:04.085 --> 45:04.739
Well...

45:06.745 --> 45:09.118
I don't really date,
you know, that much.

45:09.456 --> 45:10.489
How very unfortunate...

45:11.352 --> 45:12.238
I think for me.

45:14.520 --> 45:15.584
You know what I mean?

45:15.800 --> 45:17.548
I know you've been
thinking about it.

45:17.685 --> 45:19.263
-Oh, no, I haven't.
-Yes, you have.

45:19.788 --> 45:21.110
No, I really haven't.

45:21.171 --> 45:22.657
Yes, you have. You're hoping
to get good night kiss.

45:22.718 --> 45:23.828
No, you know, I tell ya,

45:23.895 --> 45:25.592
I was hopin' to get
a good night laid.

45:28.415 --> 45:30.595
But I'll settle for,
like, a kiss, you know?

45:30.656 --> 45:33.273
-How very noble of you.
-Thank you.

45:34.362 --> 45:36.333
No, I was... I was
hopin' for a kiss.

45:38.644 --> 45:40.970
Well, why don't we just
get it out of the way now?

45:42.989 --> 45:44.153
-Right now?
-Yeah.

45:45.666 --> 45:46.383
Come on.

45:56.052 --> 45:57.894
I think I got some
of your pickle.

46:09.995 --> 46:11.072
You again, huh?

46:13.500 --> 46:14.336
Come with me.

46:22.173 --> 46:23.304
So what's this?

46:23.365 --> 46:25.884
A Taster's Choice
moment between guys?

46:27.783 --> 46:28.847
This is really nice.

46:29.423 --> 46:31.630
You got a thing for swans?
Is this, like, a fetish?

46:31.713 --> 46:32.504
Is it something, like,

46:32.642 --> 46:34.313
maybe we need to
devote some time to?

46:35.927 --> 46:37.890
Thought about what you
said to me the other day.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.671
About my painting.

46:41.648 --> 46:43.375
Stayed up half the
night thinking about it.

46:45.612 --> 46:46.798
Something occurred to me.

46:48.013 --> 46:49.657
I fell into a deep,
peaceful sleep

46:49.973 --> 46:51.529
and haven't thought
about you since.

46:52.440 --> 46:53.563
You know what occurred to me?

46:53.887 --> 46:54.687
No.

46:55.623 --> 46:56.453
You're just a kid.

46:57.694 --> 46:59.911
You don't have the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

46:59.994 --> 47:00.756
Why, thank you.

47:01.033 --> 47:01.708
It's all right.

47:03.484 --> 47:04.715
You've never been out of Boston.

47:08.043 --> 47:08.723
Nope.

47:09.838 --> 47:11.015
So if I asked you about art,

47:11.076 --> 47:12.100
you'd probably
give me the skinny

47:12.161 --> 47:13.500
on every art book ever written.

47:14.924 --> 47:15.894
Michelangelo?

47:17.237 --> 47:18.375
You know a lot about him.

47:18.909 --> 47:19.782
Life's work,

47:20.177 --> 47:22.185
political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

47:22.483 --> 47:24.475
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

47:27.094 --> 47:28.264
I bet you can't tell me

47:28.339 --> 47:30.103
what it smells like
in the Sistine Chapel.

47:33.361 --> 47:34.865
You never actually stood there

47:34.926 --> 47:36.771
and looked up at that
beautiful ceiling.

47:40.414 --> 47:41.191
Seeing that.

47:43.263 --> 47:44.611
If I ask you about women,

47:45.003 --> 47:47.429
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites.

47:48.623 --> 47:50.677
You may have even
been laid a few times.

47:57.089 --> 47:58.738
But you can't tell
me what it feels like

47:58.799 --> 48:01.697
to wake up next to a woman,
and feel truly happy.

48:05.883 --> 48:06.743
You're a tough kid.

48:09.519 --> 48:11.366
I ask you about
war, you'd probably

48:11.609 --> 48:13.241
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

48:13.325 --> 48:15.436
'Once more into the
breach, dear friends.'

48:18.142 --> 48:19.524
But you've never been near one.

48:21.257 --> 48:23.323
You've never held your best
friend's head in your lap...

48:24.119 --> 48:27.154
and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin' to you for help.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.614
If I asked you about love,

48:32.221 --> 48:33.492
you'd probably
quote me a sonnet,

48:35.667 --> 48:36.927
but you've never
looked at a woman

48:36.988 --> 48:38.350
and been totally vulnerable.

48:40.011 --> 48:42.083
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

48:44.357 --> 48:47.150
Feelin' like God put an
angel on earth just for you,

48:49.045 --> 48:50.832
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

48:51.784 --> 48:53.802
And you wouldn't know what
it's like to be her angel,

48:55.159 --> 48:57.505
to have that love for
her be there forever.

48:58.455 --> 48:59.302
Through anything.

49:00.215 --> 49:01.071
Through cancer.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.214
And you wouldn't
know about sleepin'

49:04.275 --> 49:05.320
sittin' up in a hospital room...

49:05.381 --> 49:06.983
for two months,
holding her hand,

49:07.473 --> 49:09.178
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

49:09.383 --> 49:11.429
that the terms 'visiting
hours' don't apply to you.

49:14.074 --> 49:15.294
You don't know about real loss,

49:16.290 --> 49:17.946
'cause that only
occurs when you love

49:18.007 --> 49:19.636
something more than
you love yourself.

49:21.501 --> 49:23.862
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

49:27.740 --> 49:28.546
I look at you.

49:29.330 --> 49:31.688
I don't see an
intelligent, confident man.

49:34.893 --> 49:37.775
I see a cocky,
scared shitless kid.

49:40.169 --> 49:41.427
But you're a genius, Will.

49:41.583 --> 49:42.602
No one denies that.

49:43.533 --> 49:45.869
No one could possibly
understand the depths of you.

49:47.252 --> 49:48.674
But you presume
to know everything

49:48.735 --> 49:50.204
about me because you
saw a painting of mine.

49:50.265 --> 49:52.296
You ripped my
fuckin' life apart.

49:56.989 --> 49:57.974
You're an orphan, right?

50:03.436 --> 50:05.173
Do you think I'd
know the first thing

50:05.234 --> 50:06.850
about how hard your
life has been...

50:07.076 --> 50:09.021
how you feel, who you are...

50:09.931 --> 50:11.811
because I read Oliver Twist?

50:13.207 --> 50:14.689
Does that encapsulate you?

50:17.796 --> 50:18.451
Personally,

50:19.418 --> 50:21.448
I don't give a shit about all
that, because... you know what?

50:21.538 --> 50:23.032
I can't learn
anything from you...

50:23.093 --> 50:24.925
I can't read in
some fuckin' book.

50:27.348 --> 50:28.826
Unless you wanna talk about you,

50:29.557 --> 50:30.445
who you are.

50:32.937 --> 50:34.243
And I'm fascinated.

50:35.588 --> 50:36.207
I'm in.

50:38.985 --> 50:40.541
But you don't wanna do
that, do you, sport?

50:44.614 --> 50:46.367
You're terrified of
what you might say.

50:52.308 --> 50:53.505
Your move, chief.

52:01.847 --> 52:02.441
Hello?

52:03.421 --> 52:04.079
Hello?

52:05.661 --> 52:06.386
Hello?

52:08.160 --> 52:09.731
Professor Valenti, are
you calling me again?

52:14.239 --> 52:14.840
Freak.

52:18.419 --> 52:21.296
-Oh, God.
-Christ, who did you call?

52:21.549 --> 52:23.131
No one. I forgot the number.

52:23.406 --> 52:24.229
You fuckin' retarded?

52:24.290 --> 52:25.423
You went all the way
out there in the rain,

52:25.484 --> 52:26.521
and you didn't bring the number.

52:26.582 --> 52:28.414
No, it was your
mother's 900 number.

52:28.475 --> 52:29.751
I just ran out of quarters.

52:30.193 --> 52:32.588
Why don't we get off on mothers?
I just got off yours.

52:34.650 --> 52:35.589
That's pretty funny, Morgan.

52:35.650 --> 52:37.699
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch.

52:38.091 --> 52:39.567
Keep antagonizing me.
Watch what happens.

52:39.628 --> 52:40.309
All right, then, Morgan.

52:40.435 --> 52:42.190
-Watch what happens.
-All right, then, Morgan.

52:42.287 --> 52:44.118
Watch what happens.
Keep fuckin' with me.

52:50.486 --> 52:51.324
No smoking.

53:24.599 --> 53:25.728
What do you mean,
he didn't talk?

53:25.789 --> 53:26.920
You were in there for an hour.

53:27.057 --> 53:28.548
He just sat there
counting the seconds

53:28.609 --> 53:29.960
until the session was over.

53:30.299 --> 53:31.643
Pretty impressive, actually.

53:31.704 --> 53:32.885
Why would he do that?

53:33.093 --> 53:34.788
To prove to me he doesn't
have to talk to me

53:34.849 --> 53:35.738
if he doesn't want to.

53:37.525 --> 53:39.235
What is this? Some
kind of staring contest

53:39.296 --> 53:41.047
between two kids from
the old neighbourhood?

53:41.277 --> 53:42.061
Yeah, it is,

53:42.711 --> 53:44.278
and I can't talk first.

53:45.511 --> 53:47.003
We know your theory, Alexander,

53:47.099 --> 53:49.262
but the boy's found a
simple geometrical picture.

53:49.679 --> 53:51.474
A tree structure won't work.

53:51.535 --> 53:53.138
Look now. He's joining
the two vertices.

53:53.398 --> 53:54.993
But I can do the sum.

53:55.586 --> 53:57.777
It's how you group
the terms, Alexander.

53:57.844 --> 54:00.182
But, Gerry, if we do the
whole thing this way, then...

54:00.243 --> 54:01.665
Hey, look, look.

54:03.498 --> 54:04.391
I wrote it down.

54:04.931 --> 54:06.022
It's simpler this way.

54:17.379 --> 54:18.803
Sometimes people get lucky.

54:20.704 --> 54:21.850
You're a brilliant man.

54:59.620 --> 55:01.898
You know, I was on
this plane once,

55:01.959 --> 55:03.560
and I'm sittin' there, and...

55:05.120 --> 55:06.843
the captain gets on, he
does his whole, you know,

55:06.904 --> 55:08.810
'we'll be cruisin'
at 35,000 feet',

55:08.871 --> 55:11.012
but then he puts the mike down.
He forgets to turn it off.

55:11.810 --> 55:14.120
So he turns to the copilot.
He's, like, 'You know,

55:14.811 --> 55:16.796
all I could use right
now is a fuckin'

55:16.879 --> 55:18.543
blow job and a cup of coffee.'

55:19.241 --> 55:20.789
So the stewardess
fuckin' goes bombin'

55:20.857 --> 55:21.755
up from the back of the plane...

55:21.838 --> 55:23.506
to tell him the
microphone's still on.

55:23.567 --> 55:24.549
This guy in the back
of the plane's like,

55:24.610 --> 55:26.323
'Hey, hon, don't
forget the coffee'.

55:28.855 --> 55:30.036
You ever been on a plane?

55:30.754 --> 55:32.053
No, but it's a fuckin' joke.

55:32.114 --> 55:33.706
It works better if I tell
it in the first person.

55:33.767 --> 55:34.553
Yeah, it does.

55:39.118 --> 55:40.609
I have been laid, you know?

55:41.249 --> 55:41.814
Really?

55:42.755 --> 55:43.483
Good for you.

55:43.553 --> 55:44.165
Big time.

55:44.226 --> 55:45.449
Big time, huh?

55:47.002 --> 55:48.227
I went on a date last week.

55:48.517 --> 55:49.833
-How'd it go?
-It was good.

55:51.566 --> 55:52.498
Goin' out again?

55:52.826 --> 55:53.497
I don't know.

55:53.558 --> 55:54.049
Why not?

55:54.376 --> 55:55.060
Haven't called her.

55:55.529 --> 55:56.649
Christ, you're an amateur.

55:57.092 --> 55:58.650
-I know what I'm doin'.
-Oh, yeah?

56:00.570 --> 56:02.244
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

56:03.060 --> 56:05.475
Yeah, but this girl was,
like, you know, beautiful.

56:05.536 --> 56:06.982
She's smart. She's fun.

56:08.432 --> 56:10.190
She's different from most
of the girls I've been with.

56:10.657 --> 56:11.911
So call her up, Romeo.

56:12.007 --> 56:13.755
Why, so I can realize
she's not that smart.

56:13.816 --> 56:15.877
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...

56:16.350 --> 56:18.341
This girl's, like,
fuckin' perfect right now.

56:18.402 --> 56:19.734
I don't wanna ruin that.

56:20.687 --> 56:22.050
Maybe you're perfect right now.

56:22.111 --> 56:23.340
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

56:25.493 --> 56:27.619
But I think that's a
super philosophy, Will.

56:27.661 --> 56:29.312
That way, you can go
through your entire life

56:29.373 --> 56:31.062
without ever having to
really know anybody.

56:36.032 --> 56:37.797
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

56:38.231 --> 56:40.465
She had all sorts of
wonderful idiosyncrasies.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.617
You know, she used
to fart in her sleep.

56:44.759 --> 56:46.515
Just thought I'd
share that with you.

56:46.764 --> 56:49.350
One night it was so
loud, it woke the dog up.

56:53.237 --> 56:55.129
She woke up and gone,
like, 'Was that you?'

56:55.190 --> 56:56.565
I said, 'Yeah'. I didn't
have the heart to tell her.

56:57.025 --> 56:58.153
Oh, God.

56:58.236 --> 57:00.488
-She woke herself up?
-Yes.

57:05.698 --> 57:07.249
Oh, Christ.

57:07.580 --> 57:09.643
But, Will, she's
been dead two years

57:09.707 --> 57:10.865
and that's the shit I remember.

57:11.626 --> 57:12.881
It's wonderful stuff, you know?

57:13.021 --> 57:14.044
Little things like that.

57:14.168 --> 57:17.013
Yeah, but those are the
things I miss the most.

57:18.444 --> 57:20.917
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

57:21.777 --> 57:23.167
That's what made her my wife.

57:24.141 --> 57:25.612
Boy, and she had
the goods on me too.

57:25.673 --> 57:27.689
She knew all my
little peccadilloes.

57:28.369 --> 57:30.395
People call these
things 'imperfections',

57:30.935 --> 57:33.132
but they're not.
That's the good stuff.

57:34.609 --> 57:35.747
And then we get to choose

57:35.808 --> 57:37.804
who we let into our
weird little worlds.

57:40.124 --> 57:41.369
You're not perfect, sport.

57:42.184 --> 57:43.890
And let me save
you the suspense.

57:44.380 --> 57:45.293
This girl you met,

57:46.000 --> 57:47.044
she isn't perfect either.

57:47.476 --> 57:49.129
But the question
is whether or not

57:49.190 --> 57:50.352
you're perfect for each other.

57:51.365 --> 57:52.505
That's the whole deal.

57:52.566 --> 57:54.124
That's what intimacy
is all about.

57:56.039 --> 57:57.718
Now you can know everything
in the world, sport,

57:57.760 --> 57:59.323
but the only way you're
findin' out that one

57:59.384 --> 58:00.410
is by givin' it a shot.

58:01.033 --> 58:03.233
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

58:03.863 --> 58:06.376
Even if I did know, I wouldn't
tell a pissant like you.

58:08.355 --> 58:09.439
Yeah, why not?

58:09.848 --> 58:12.776
You told me every other fuckin' thing.
Jesus Christ.

58:13.513 --> 58:16.114
Fuckin' talk more than any
shrink I ever seen in my life.

58:16.155 --> 58:18.301
I teach the shit. I didn't
say I knew how to do it.

58:20.256 --> 58:20.807
Yeah.

58:26.787 --> 58:28.386
You ever think about
gettin' remarried?

58:28.607 --> 58:29.529
My wife's dead.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.605
Hence the word 'remarried'.

58:32.968 --> 58:33.671
She's dead.

58:36.912 --> 58:39.882
Yeah, well, I think that's
a super philosophy, Sean.

58:39.943 --> 58:41.088
I mean, that way,
you can actually

58:41.149 --> 58:42.128
go through the rest
of your life...

58:42.189 --> 58:43.757
without ever really
knowing anybody.

58:47.353 --> 58:48.071
Time's up.

59:03.768 --> 59:05.323
-Hold it open.
-Okay.

59:05.850 --> 59:06.557
Thanks.

59:37.559 --> 59:39.289
'G' minor seventh,
saddest of all chords.

59:42.353 --> 59:43.239
-Hello.
-Hey.

59:44.273 --> 59:45.057
Where have you been?

59:45.744 --> 59:46.882
I'm sorry. I've been,

59:47.256 --> 59:48.482
like... really busy, and...

59:49.499 --> 59:50.670
-But, um...
-Me too.

59:51.341 --> 59:52.078
Yeah.

59:52.735 --> 59:53.528
I...

59:54.189 --> 59:55.567
I thought you'd call.

59:57.206 --> 59:58.209
Yeah, um...

59:59.304 --> 01:00:00.448
I mean, we had a
really good time.

01:00:00.509 --> 01:00:02.427
I had a really good time too.
I mean, I just... I...

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.037
I'm sorry, you know. I blew it.

01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:07.889
No. No, I mean, you
know, it's all right.

01:00:08.642 --> 01:00:10.082
Yeah, um, so, I was...

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.627
wonderin' if, uh,

01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:13.265
if, you know, you'd give
me another crack at it.

01:00:13.326 --> 01:00:14.752
You know, let me
take you out again.

01:00:15.617 --> 01:00:16.777
I can't.

01:00:17.817 --> 01:00:18.416
All right.

01:00:18.477 --> 01:00:19.318
Oh, no, I didn't...

01:00:19.669 --> 01:00:21.551
I didn't mean I
can't, like, ever.

01:00:21.962 --> 01:00:23.692
I just can't right now.

01:00:23.946 --> 01:00:27.145
I've got to assign the proton
spectrum for 'ebogamine'.

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.100
All that sounds really,
really interesting.

01:00:29.161 --> 01:00:31.119
It's actually
fantastically boring.

01:00:31.639 --> 01:00:33.929
-All right, um...
-Maybe some other time.

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.867
Like tomorrow?

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.391
Um, yeah, all right.

01:00:37.774 --> 01:00:38.700
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:00:39.924 --> 01:00:40.667
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:57.645
What are you doing here?

01:00:57.896 --> 01:00:59.224
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:02.580
Where the fuck did you get this?

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.624
I had to sleep with
someone in your class.

01:01:04.685 --> 01:01:06.693
Oh, I hope it was someone
with the open-toed sandals

01:01:06.754 --> 01:01:08.477
and the really bad breath.

01:01:10.673 --> 01:01:11.903
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

01:01:11.964 --> 01:01:13.914
No, I've got to learn this.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.722
Well, you're not going into
surgery tomorrow, are you?

01:01:17.311 --> 01:01:17.801
No.

01:01:18.414 --> 01:01:19.331
Let's go.

01:01:23.207 --> 01:01:26.267
Oh, my God! My dog is winning!

01:01:27.686 --> 01:01:29.359
Come on, Misty!

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.681
Come on! Run! Look at that!
Come on!

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:34.462
Look, there he goes. Misty, run!
Come on!

01:01:37.314 --> 01:01:38.141
We won.

01:01:39.302 --> 01:01:40.453
He totally won.

01:01:43.176 --> 01:01:44.564
So did you grow up
around here then?

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.156
Not far. South Boston.

01:01:49.837 --> 01:01:51.190
Still glowing from my win.

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:53.291
Look at you. You're so happy.

01:01:56.158 --> 01:01:57.204
And what was that like then?

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.916
It was normal, I guess.
Nothin' special.

01:02:02.491 --> 01:02:03.904
Do you got lots of
brothers and sisters?

01:02:04.484 --> 01:02:06.013
Do I have a lot of
brothers and sisters?

01:02:06.074 --> 01:02:06.727
That's what I said.

01:02:07.776 --> 01:02:09.299
Well, Irish Catholic,
what do you think?

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:11.487
Right. That's right.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.276
How many?

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:16.606
God. You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

01:02:19.178 --> 01:02:21.494
Why? Go on. What? Five?

01:02:21.555 --> 01:02:22.813
-No.
-Seven?

01:02:23.862 --> 01:02:25.291
Eight? How many?

01:02:25.352 --> 01:02:27.490
-I have 12 big brothers.
-You do not!

01:02:27.551 --> 01:02:28.683
No, I swear to God.

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:30.583
I swear to God. I'm
lucky 13 right here.

01:02:31.064 --> 01:02:32.411
Do you know all their names?

01:02:33.664 --> 01:02:35.267
Do I... yeah,
they're my brothers.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.488
What are they called?

01:02:37.581 --> 01:02:39.810
Marky, Ricky, Danny,
Terry, Mikey, Davey,

01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:41.918
Timmy, Tommy, Joey,
Robby, Johnny and Brian.

01:02:42.438 --> 01:02:43.333
Say it again.

01:02:44.171 --> 01:02:46.315
Marky, Ricky, Danny,
Terry, Mikey, Davey,

01:02:46.376 --> 01:02:48.629
Timmy, Tommy, Joey,
Robby, Johnny and Brian.

01:02:50.486 --> 01:02:51.434
And Willy.

01:02:51.495 --> 01:02:52.305
-Willy?
-Yeah.

01:02:52.389 --> 01:02:54.133
-Will.
-Wow.

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:56.437
Do you still see all of them?

01:02:56.617 --> 01:02:57.881
Yeah, well, they
all live in Southie.

01:02:57.942 --> 01:02:59.734
I'm livin' with three
of 'em right now.

01:02:59.795 --> 01:03:00.516
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:03:01.214 --> 01:03:02.334
I'd like to meet them.

01:03:03.093 --> 01:03:04.175
Yeah, we'll do that.

01:03:05.666 --> 01:03:07.157
Oh, you know, I read
your book last night.

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:08.693
Oh, so you're the one.

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.932
Do you still, uh... Do you
still counsel veterans?

01:03:12.119 --> 01:03:13.078
No, I don't.

01:03:13.162 --> 01:03:13.703
Why not?

01:03:13.764 --> 01:03:15.792
Well, I gave it up
when my wife got sick.

01:03:18.093 --> 01:03:20.536
You ever wonder what your
life would be like if you, uh,

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:22.750
if you never met your wife?

01:03:23.856 --> 01:03:26.122
What? Wonder if I'd be
better off without her?

01:03:26.183 --> 01:03:27.288
No, no, no, I'm not
saying, like, better off.

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.910
No.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:28.780
I didn't mean it like that.

01:03:28.841 --> 01:03:30.212
It's all right. It's
an important question.

01:03:31.905 --> 01:03:33.149
'Cause you'll have bad times,

01:03:33.285 --> 01:03:34.406
but that'll always
wake you up...

01:03:34.467 --> 01:03:36.354
to the good stuff you
weren't paying attention to.

01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:39.279
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

01:03:39.446 --> 01:03:41.114
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

01:03:42.129 --> 01:03:43.449
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but,

01:03:44.203 --> 01:03:46.489
I don't regret a single
day I spent with her.

01:03:51.879 --> 01:03:54.763
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:57.429
October 21, 1975.

01:03:57.889 --> 01:03:59.674
Jesus Christ. You
know the fuckin' day?

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:00.563
Oh, yeah,

01:04:01.594 --> 01:04:03.119
'cause it was game six
of the World Series,

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.037
biggest game in Red Sox history.

01:04:05.098 --> 01:04:06.111
Yeah, sure.

01:04:06.248 --> 01:04:09.879
My friends and I had slept
out all night to get tickets.

01:04:10.005 --> 01:04:11.065
You got tickets?

01:04:11.419 --> 01:04:13.307
Yep. Day of the game
I was sittin' in a bar,

01:04:13.368 --> 01:04:14.673
waitin' for the game to start

01:04:15.596 --> 01:04:16.816
and in walks this girl.

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.499
It was an amazing game though.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.236
You know, bottom of the
eighth, Carbo ties it up.

01:04:20.319 --> 01:04:21.113
It was 6-6.

01:04:21.669 --> 01:04:22.643
It went to 12.

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:23.833
Bottom of the 12th,

01:04:24.145 --> 01:04:26.433
in stepped Carlton
Fisk, old Pudge.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.958
Steps up to the plate. You know,

01:04:28.019 --> 01:04:29.427
-he's got that weird stance.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:04:29.488 --> 01:04:31.817
And then 'Boom'! He
clocks it, you know.

01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:35.071
High fly ball down
the left field line!

01:04:35.132 --> 01:04:37.195
Thirty-five thousand
people on their feet,

01:04:37.538 --> 01:04:38.709
yellin' at the ball.
But that's nothin',

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:40.359
'cause Fisk, he's wavin'
at the ball like a madman.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.266
-Yeah, I've seen that.
-'Get over! Get over!

01:04:42.327 --> 01:04:43.421
-Right.
-Get over!'

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.487
Then it hits the foul pole.

01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:48.420
He goes ape-shit,
and 35,000 fans...

01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:50.269
They charge the field, you know.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.259
Yeah, and he's fuckin'
blowin' people outta the way.

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:54.702
'Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!'

01:04:54.963 --> 01:04:57.479
I can't fuckin' believe you had
tickets to that fuckin' game!

01:04:57.814 --> 01:04:58.613
Did you rush the field?

01:04:58.674 --> 01:05:00.799
No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
I wasn't there.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.130
What?

01:05:02.259 --> 01:05:04.525
No, I was in a bar, havin'
a drink with my future wife.

01:05:04.638 --> 01:05:06.611
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run...
-Oh yeah.

01:05:06.827 --> 01:05:09.039
to have a fuckin' drink with
some lady you never met?

01:05:09.123 --> 01:05:11.501
Yeah, but you should have seen her.
She was a stunner.

01:05:11.562 --> 01:05:13.919
-I don't care if...
-Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

01:05:14.032 --> 01:05:16.075
I don't care if Helen of
Troy walks into the room.

01:05:16.136 --> 01:05:16.873
Oh, Helen of Troy!

01:05:16.934 --> 01:05:18.089
That's game six! Oh, my God,

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:19.344
and who were these
friends of yours?

01:05:19.405 --> 01:05:20.720
They let you get away with that?

01:05:20.781 --> 01:05:21.553
They had to.

01:05:21.654 --> 01:05:23.404
What did you say to 'em?

01:05:23.674 --> 01:05:25.279
I just slid my ticket
across the table.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.771
I said, 'Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl.'

01:05:29.288 --> 01:05:30.890
-'I gotta go see about a girl'?
-Yes!

01:05:30.951 --> 01:05:33.163
That's what you said? They
let you get away with that?

01:05:33.224 --> 01:05:35.143
Oh, yeah. They saw it in
my eyes that I meant it.

01:05:35.896 --> 01:05:36.597
You're kiddin' me?

01:05:36.947 --> 01:05:38.146
No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:39.803
That's why I'm not
talkin' right now

01:05:39.864 --> 01:05:41.839
about some girl I saw
at a bar 20 years ago...

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.136
and how I always regretted not
goin' over and talkin' to her.

01:05:44.943 --> 01:05:47.248
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

01:05:47.412 --> 01:05:48.605
I don't regret the six years

01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:50.276
I had to give up counselling
when she got sick,

01:05:50.626 --> 01:05:53.222
and I don't regret the last
years when she got really sick.

01:05:54.904 --> 01:05:57.109
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.

01:05:58.362 --> 01:05:59.259
That's regret.

01:06:00.155 --> 01:06:00.955
Wow!

01:06:08.323 --> 01:06:10.015
Would have been nice to
catch that game though.

01:06:10.392 --> 01:06:12.258
I didn't know Pudge was
gonna hit a home run.

01:06:15.425 --> 01:06:16.044
You know,

01:06:17.463 --> 01:06:20.156
I'm very, very useful on the court.
I'm extremely tall.

01:06:21.806 --> 01:06:23.730
-You're not that tall.
-I dunk.

01:06:27.376 --> 01:06:29.186
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

01:06:30.954 --> 01:06:32.701
'It is decidedly so.'

01:06:36.937 --> 01:06:38.784
Why do we always stay here?

01:06:40.117 --> 01:06:42.005
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

01:06:42.317 --> 01:06:43.887
Yes, but I've never
seen your place.

01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:46.150
I know.

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.547
When am I gonna meet your
friends and your brothers?

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.735
Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

01:06:53.222 --> 01:06:55.282
I think I can make
it to South Boston.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.262
It's kind of a hike.

01:06:59.475 --> 01:07:01.870
Is it me you're hiding from
them or the other way around?

01:07:03.165 --> 01:07:05.338
-All right, we'll go.
-When?

01:07:06.364 --> 01:07:08.605
I don't know. We'll
go sometime next week.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.145
What if I said I would
not sleep with you again

01:07:12.206 --> 01:07:14.134
until you let me
meet your friends?

01:07:19.667 --> 01:07:21.492
I'd say it's, like,
4:30 in the mornin'.

01:07:21.553 --> 01:07:22.442
They're probably up.

01:07:23.156 --> 01:07:24.100
Oh, my God.

01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:26.098
Men are shameless.

01:07:26.434 --> 01:07:28.024
If you're not thinking
with your wiener,

01:07:28.085 --> 01:07:29.846
then you're acting
directly on its behalf.

01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:32.479
You bet. And on
behalf of my wiener,

01:07:32.825 --> 01:07:34.378
can I get an advance payment?

01:07:34.439 --> 01:07:35.125
I don't know. Let's ask.

01:07:37.651 --> 01:07:39.208
'Outlook does not look good.'

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:39.864
What?

01:07:39.954 --> 01:07:42.345
Fuck the... Hey, Chuck. No.
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

01:07:42.736 --> 01:07:44.513
'Outlook'? That's the same thing

01:07:44.588 --> 01:07:45.866
that told you you was
gonna play in the N.B.A.

01:07:45.927 --> 01:07:47.296
Well, exactly, so look out.

01:07:47.357 --> 01:07:48.933
You'd better start buying
some season tickets.

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.954
I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

01:07:55.531 --> 01:07:57.266
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

01:07:57.408 --> 01:07:59.697
-You're not that tall.
-Yes, I am.

01:08:00.228 --> 01:08:02.605
Maybe I'm all
about three points.

01:08:03.314 --> 01:08:04.745
I'm all about home runs.

01:08:06.704 --> 01:08:09.488
Stop mixing your
sporting metaphors.

01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:24.759
A leprechaun's got his
dick in the monkey's ass.

01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:26.555
Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',

01:08:26.616 --> 01:08:28.557
'I don't mind it. I don't mind.'

01:08:30.988 --> 01:08:33.127
Well, I can't believe
you brought Skylar here

01:08:33.188 --> 01:08:34.756
when we're fuckin' all
bombed and drinkin'.

01:08:34.817 --> 01:08:37.136
I know, Morgan. It's a real
rarity we'd be all drinkin'.

01:08:37.197 --> 01:08:38.528
My uncle Marty drinks.

01:08:39.283 --> 01:08:41.560
He'll go on a bender
for six, eight months.

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:42.733
Did I ever tell ya
what happened to him

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:44.116
when he was drivin' up
there and got pulled over?

01:08:44.176 --> 01:08:45.737
-I told you guys, right?
-Marty, yeah.

01:08:45.798 --> 01:08:47.651
Let me tell ya what
happened to my uncle Marty,

01:08:47.712 --> 01:08:49.444
because you oughta know this.

01:08:50.045 --> 01:08:51.258
He's always tellin' stories.

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:53.286
Every time we come here
he's got another story.

01:08:53.368 --> 01:08:55.947
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

01:08:57.575 --> 01:08:59.368
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.384
Guess I have the floor now.

01:09:02.774 --> 01:09:04.776
My uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

01:09:05.554 --> 01:09:07.180
Bombed out of his tree, right?

01:09:07.241 --> 01:09:10.081
Just hammered out of his gourd.
Just wrecked.

01:09:10.624 --> 01:09:12.944
This state trooper sees
him, pulls him over.

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.435
So my uncle's fucked basically.

01:09:14.502 --> 01:09:16.441
Got him out of the car, tryin'
to make him walk the line.

01:09:16.502 --> 01:09:17.394
He gets out of the car,

01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:20.399
pukes, and the statie's pretty
sure he's over the legal limit.

01:09:20.837 --> 01:09:24.444
So he's about to throw the cuffs
on him and put him in jail.

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:26.233
All of a sudden, 50
yards down the road,

01:09:26.426 --> 01:09:28.345
there's this huge
fuckin' boom, right?

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:30.197
Statie gets real spooked.

01:09:30.258 --> 01:09:31.997
-He turns around.
-He got shot?

01:09:32.515 --> 01:09:35.102
No. So... So... You
heard this story before.

01:09:35.162 --> 01:09:37.136
Yeah, Morgan, stop. Stop.

01:09:37.453 --> 01:09:39.259
Some other guy's
car had hit a tree.

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.880
Okay. There was an accident.

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:42.983
Anyway...

01:09:43.044 --> 01:09:45.050
-How could he hear...
-Shut the fuck up!

01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:46.750
You're drivin' him nuts, Morgan.

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:48.277
I'm gonna break your neck.
Shut up!

01:09:48.337 --> 01:09:49.890
He told you the
story once before.

01:09:49.932 --> 01:09:52.386
So he tells my uncle, 'Stay here.
Don't move.'

01:09:52.585 --> 01:09:53.808
Statie goes runnin' down the

01:09:54.252 --> 01:09:56.072
road to deal with
the other accident.

01:09:56.875 --> 01:09:58.406
After a few minutes of just

01:09:58.467 --> 01:10:00.434
lyin' in his own piss and vomit,

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.034
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

01:10:03.095 --> 01:10:05.170
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

01:10:05.407 --> 01:10:08.310
The next mornin' my
uncle's just passed out.

01:10:08.452 --> 01:10:10.640
He hears this
knockin' at the door.

01:10:10.701 --> 01:10:11.941
So he goes downstairs,

01:10:12.129 --> 01:10:13.322
pulls the door open 'What?'

01:10:14.023 --> 01:10:15.496
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

01:10:15.993 --> 01:10:17.579
Statie says, 'Fuck
you mean, 'What?'

01:10:17.764 --> 01:10:18.652
You know what.

01:10:18.739 --> 01:10:21.535
I pulled you over last night
is what, and you took off.'

01:10:21.775 --> 01:10:24.101
He's like, 'I never seen
you before in my life.

01:10:24.162 --> 01:10:25.641
I've been home all
night with my kids.

01:10:25.702 --> 01:10:27.001
I don't know who
the fuck you are.'

01:10:27.168 --> 01:10:28.456
He's like, 'You know who I am.

01:10:28.517 --> 01:10:29.838
Let me get in your garage.'

01:10:30.487 --> 01:10:31.303
My uncle's like,

01:10:31.414 --> 01:10:32.603
'What?' He said, 'You heard me.
Let me get in your garage.'

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:33.807
He was like, 'All right. Fine.'

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.717
Takes him out to the
garage, opens the door.

01:10:35.838 --> 01:10:37.232
And there's...

01:10:37.916 --> 01:10:40.976
the statie's police cruiser
is in my uncle's garage.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:43.176
He was so fuckin'...

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.943
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

01:10:46.631 --> 01:10:49.546
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...

01:10:49.658 --> 01:10:51.894
was so embarrassed he
didn't do anything.

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.643
He'd been drivin' around all
night in my uncle's Chevelle,

01:10:54.704 --> 01:10:55.462
lookin' for the house.

01:10:55.758 --> 01:10:58.800
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

01:10:59.633 --> 01:11:01.844
He got away. That's the point.

01:11:02.655 --> 01:11:04.786
-Well, question...
-Come on. Stop.

01:11:05.034 --> 01:11:08.146
-I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.
-You're embarrassing him.

01:11:08.207 --> 01:11:10.837
-It doesn't make any sense.
-It does make sense,

01:11:10.898 --> 01:11:12.995
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.

01:11:13.075 --> 01:11:14.595
Well, let's see if
you can get this one.

01:11:14.656 --> 01:11:15.844
I've got a little story for you.

01:11:16.448 --> 01:11:17.098
All right.

01:11:17.631 --> 01:11:19.111
There's an old couple in bed,

01:11:19.897 --> 01:11:21.119
Mary and Paddie.

01:11:21.772 --> 01:11:23.894
They wake up on the
morning of their

01:11:24.532 --> 01:11:25.891
50th anniversary.

01:11:26.786 --> 01:11:29.292
Mary looks over and gazes
adoringly at Paddie.

01:11:29.353 --> 01:11:31.397
She's like, 'Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

01:11:31.923 --> 01:11:34.087
You're such a good-looking feller.
I love ya.

01:11:34.716 --> 01:11:36.267
I want to give ya
a little present.

01:11:36.696 --> 01:11:39.552
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

01:11:40.449 --> 01:11:41.270
What would ya like?

01:11:41.638 --> 01:11:42.398
Paddie's like,

01:11:43.467 --> 01:11:46.310
'Oh, gee, Mary. That's
a very sweet offer.

01:11:46.393 --> 01:11:48.697
Now, in 50 years,

01:11:48.794 --> 01:11:50.764
there's one thing
that's been missing,

01:11:51.644 --> 01:11:52.632
and, uh,

01:11:53.156 --> 01:11:55.417
I would like you to
give me a blow job.

01:11:56.056 --> 01:11:58.907
I would like for it.'
Mary's like, 'All right.'

01:11:58.990 --> 01:12:00.106
She takes her teeth out,

01:12:00.489 --> 01:12:01.559
puts 'em in the glass.

01:12:02.049 --> 01:12:03.411
She gives him a blow job.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.774
Afterwards, Paddie's like,

01:12:04.835 --> 01:12:07.416
'Yeah, geez, now that's
what I've been missin'.

01:12:07.552 --> 01:12:11.420
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:13.080
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

01:12:14.124 --> 01:12:16.017
Is there anything that
I can do for you?'

01:12:17.035 --> 01:12:18.891
Mary looks up to
him and she goes,

01:12:20.214 --> 01:12:21.515
'Give us a kiss.'

01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:23.892
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.110
-That's filthy.
-It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.

01:12:32.199 --> 01:12:33.214
Get off of me!

01:12:34.093 --> 01:12:35.559
All right. See you guys later.

01:12:35.849 --> 01:12:37.313
All right. Take it easy, Bill.

01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:41.620
So, Skylar, thanks
for comin' by.

01:12:41.862 --> 01:12:43.664
Changed my opinion
of Harvard people.

01:12:43.725 --> 01:12:45.603
You don't want to rush
to judgement on that one,

01:12:45.664 --> 01:12:46.952
'cause they're not all like me.

01:12:47.562 --> 01:12:50.005
Oh. I'm sure. It
was nice to meet ya.

01:12:50.363 --> 01:12:50.956
Oh.

01:12:51.296 --> 01:12:52.201
Take it easy.

01:12:52.986 --> 01:12:54.200
-Oh, come on.
-Slowly back away.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.929
-Brother.
-I don't know what you're doin', dude.

01:12:56.971 --> 01:12:58.094
You're givin' us a ride.

01:12:59.138 --> 01:13:00.218
What the fuck do I
look like to you?

01:13:00.279 --> 01:13:01.044
Come on, Chuck.

01:13:01.225 --> 01:13:03.575
You're walkin', bitch.
Will's takin' the car.

01:13:04.309 --> 01:13:06.117
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

01:13:06.663 --> 01:13:09.750
I don't know what you're
gettin' all serious about.

01:13:09.811 --> 01:13:11.052
You're droppin' me off first.

01:13:11.925 --> 01:13:12.868
It's really out of the way.

01:13:12.929 --> 01:13:15.184
Oh, okay. Just
'cause you don't have

01:13:15.245 --> 01:13:16.887
to sleep in your one-room
palace tonight...

01:13:16.948 --> 01:13:18.369
don't start thinkin' you're bad.

01:13:18.453 --> 01:13:20.447
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

01:13:20.788 --> 01:13:23.917
-Not tonight.
-Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.718
He knows once you
see that shit-hole

01:13:25.779 --> 01:13:27.201
he's gettin' dropped
like a bad habit.

01:13:27.854 --> 01:13:29.225
But I wanted to
meet your brothers.

01:13:29.916 --> 01:13:31.274
We're gonna do
that another time.

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:32.929
All right.

01:13:36.056 --> 01:13:37.059
Need them keys.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.207
The stewardess hears this

01:13:40.305 --> 01:13:42.113
and goes haulin'
ass down the aisle.

01:13:42.642 --> 01:13:43.448
I yell,

01:13:43.804 --> 01:13:45.127
'Don't forget the coffee.'

01:13:46.163 --> 01:13:46.908
No shit!

01:13:47.134 --> 01:13:48.225
You didn't say that.

01:13:48.867 --> 01:13:50.969
For Christ's sake,
Marty, it's a joke.

01:13:51.031 --> 01:13:52.349
I know someone that
actually happened to, Marty.

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:53.774
-A joke.
-Gerry.

01:13:53.955 --> 01:13:55.041
Hi. Have trouble
findin' the place?

01:13:55.102 --> 01:13:56.097
No, I took a cab.

01:13:56.574 --> 01:13:57.997
Timmy, this is Gerry.

01:13:58.474 --> 01:13:59.545
We went to college together.

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:01.626
How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.

01:14:02.674 --> 01:14:04.215
-Pleased to meet you.
-Can I get you a beer?

01:14:04.670 --> 01:14:06.555
Um, no, just a Perrier.

01:14:07.215 --> 01:14:08.486
That's French for club soda.

01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:11.035
Club soda, yeah.

01:14:11.403 --> 01:14:12.538
Couple of sandwiches too.

01:14:12.665 --> 01:14:13.805
-Sure.
-Put it on my tab.

01:14:14.092 --> 01:14:15.845
You ever plannin'
on payin' your tab?

01:14:16.357 --> 01:14:18.855
Yeah, chief, got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

01:14:19.115 --> 01:14:20.441
-What's the jackpot?
-Twelve million.

01:14:20.502 --> 01:14:21.579
I don't think that'll cover it.

01:14:21.642 --> 01:14:23.661
It'll cover your sex
change operation.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:28.959
Nuts?

01:14:29.484 --> 01:14:30.571
No, thank you.

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:37.407
So, you wanted to
talk about Will.

01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:40.435
-Well, it seems to be going well.
-I think so.

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:45.319
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:47.826
No, we haven't
gotten into that yet.

01:14:47.887 --> 01:14:49.179
We're still bangin'
away at the past.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:50.842
Maybe you should.

01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:53.348
My phone's been ringing off
the hook with job offers.

01:14:53.482 --> 01:14:54.192
What kind?

01:14:55.462 --> 01:14:56.650
Cutting edge mathematics,

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.147
think tanks. The kind
of place where a mind

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:00.456
like Will's is given free rein.

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:03.898
That's great that
there are offers,

01:15:03.959 --> 01:15:05.693
but I don't really think
he's ready for that.

01:15:10.293 --> 01:15:12.124
I'm not sure you
understand, Sean.

01:15:13.894 --> 01:15:15.685
-What don't I understand?
-Here you go, guys.

01:15:16.938 --> 01:15:18.474
-Thanks, Tim.
-Yeah, thank you.

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:20.893
Just so you don't
get sticky fingers.

01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:24.024
Tim, can you help us?

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.451
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

01:15:26.746 --> 01:15:27.400
Uh-oh.

01:15:27.582 --> 01:15:29.016
Ever heard of Jonas Salk?

01:15:30.023 --> 01:15:31.184
Sure. Cured polio.

01:15:31.332 --> 01:15:32.692
Ever heard of Albert Einstein?

01:15:33.546 --> 01:15:34.289
Hey.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.258
How about Gerald Lambeau?

01:15:38.319 --> 01:15:39.332
Ever heard of him?

01:15:40.812 --> 01:15:41.148
-No.

01:15:41.558 --> 01:15:42.594
Thank you, Tim.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:45.080
-So who won the bet?
-I did.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.948
This isn't about me, Sean.

01:15:52.558 --> 01:15:54.346
I'm nothing compared
to this young man.

01:15:58.314 --> 01:16:00.117
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

01:16:00.507 --> 01:16:02.882
In 1905 there were
hundreds of professors

01:16:02.943 --> 01:16:04.895
renown for their
study of the universe.

01:16:04.956 --> 01:16:09.000
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk,

01:16:09.539 --> 01:16:11.980
doing physics in his spare
time, who changed the world.

01:16:12.257 --> 01:16:13.943
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

01:16:14.004 --> 01:16:16.454
just to get drunk with his
buddies in Vienna every night.

01:16:17.246 --> 01:16:18.565
We all would have
lost something.

01:16:20.372 --> 01:16:21.525
Tim would never
have heard of him.

01:16:21.972 --> 01:16:23.169
Pretty dramatic, Gerry.

01:16:23.499 --> 01:16:24.431
No, it isn't, Sean.

01:16:25.127 --> 01:16:26.474
This boy has that gift.

01:16:27.368 --> 01:16:28.829
He just doesn't
got the direction,

01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:29.852
but we can give that to him.

01:16:30.392 --> 01:16:30.949
Hey, Gerry,

01:16:31.584 --> 01:16:33.557
in the 1960s, there
was a young man

01:16:33.618 --> 01:16:35.378
graduated from
University of Michigan.

01:16:36.005 --> 01:16:38.541
Did some brilliant
work in mathematics.

01:16:38.608 --> 01:16:40.856
Specifically, bounded
harmonic functions.

01:16:41.111 --> 01:16:42.197
Then he went on to Berkeley.

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:44.019
He was assistant professor.
Showed amazing potential.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.001
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:48.466
Yeah, so who was he?

01:16:49.086 --> 01:16:49.991
Ted Kaczynski.

01:16:51.199 --> 01:16:51.909
Haven't heard of him.

01:16:52.098 --> 01:16:52.848
Hey, Timmy!

01:16:53.143 --> 01:16:53.749
Yo!

01:16:53.861 --> 01:16:55.209
Who's Ted Kaczynski?

01:16:55.672 --> 01:16:56.558
Unabomber.

01:16:59.674 --> 01:17:01.609
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

01:17:01.957 --> 01:17:03.774
-We gotta give this kid direction.
-Yeah...

01:17:03.839 --> 01:17:05.181
He can contribute to the world,

01:17:05.401 --> 01:17:06.406
and we can help him do that.

01:17:06.467 --> 01:17:08.344
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.

01:17:08.637 --> 01:17:10.307
-Sean!
-We have to let him find...

01:17:10.368 --> 01:17:12.053
I'm not sitting at
home every night

01:17:12.114 --> 01:17:13.789
twisting my moustache
and hatching a...

01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:15.687
hatching a plan to
ruin this boy's life!

01:17:15.947 --> 01:17:17.702
I was doing advanced mathematics

01:17:18.429 --> 01:17:20.547
when I was 18, and it
still took me over 20 years

01:17:20.608 --> 01:17:21.853
to do something worthy
of a Field's medal.

01:17:21.914 --> 01:17:23.720
Maybe he doesn't
want what you want.

01:17:24.234 --> 01:17:26.448
There's more to life than
a fuckin' Field's medal.

01:17:26.807 --> 01:17:28.249
This is too important, Sean,

01:17:28.972 --> 01:17:30.452
and it's above personal rivalry.

01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:31.968
Wait a minute. Wait
a minute, Gerry.

01:17:32.029 --> 01:17:33.070
Let's talk about the boy.

01:17:33.131 --> 01:17:35.750
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

01:17:35.946 --> 01:17:37.871
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.

01:17:37.946 --> 01:17:39.389
It worked wonders
for you, didn't it?

01:17:40.129 --> 01:17:42.206
Yeah, it did, you
arrogant fuckin' prick!

01:17:43.616 --> 01:17:44.529
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:17:45.063 --> 01:17:46.637
I'm sorry that I
came here today.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.025
I came here out of courtesy.

01:17:48.092 --> 01:17:49.636
I wanted to keep
you in the loop.

01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:50.476
Nice to be in the loop.

01:17:50.836 --> 01:17:52.209
The boy's in a meeting right now

01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:53.841
I set up for him over at McNeil.

01:17:54.618 --> 01:17:56.145
Well, Will,

01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:58.967
I'm not exactly
sure what you mean.

01:17:59.445 --> 01:18:01.102
We've already offered
you a position.

01:18:01.331 --> 01:18:03.333
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

01:18:03.683 --> 01:18:05.420
You think you can find
somebody who does,

01:18:05.538 --> 01:18:06.850
you have my blessin'.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.562
But I think we all
know that person

01:18:08.623 --> 01:18:10.454
is not gonna represent
you as well as I can.

01:18:10.538 --> 01:18:13.964
Will, our offer
is $84,000 a year.

01:18:14.025 --> 01:18:16.440
Retainer!

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.339
Retainer.

01:18:18.769 --> 01:18:19.677
You want us...

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:21.359
to give you cash right now?

01:18:21.595 --> 01:18:24.651
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy...
Now, I didn't say that.

01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:26.674
Allegedly,

01:18:28.008 --> 01:18:29.320
your situation,

01:18:29.834 --> 01:18:30.665
for you,

01:18:31.045 --> 01:18:32.782
would be concurrently
improved...

01:18:33.355 --> 01:18:34.599
if I had...

01:18:34.948 --> 01:18:37.296
$200 in my back
pocket right now.

01:18:38.954 --> 01:18:40.719
I don't think I can...

01:18:41.733 --> 01:18:42.413
Larry?

01:18:42.788 --> 01:18:45.430
I've got $73.

01:18:45.975 --> 01:18:47.211
Will you take a check?

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:50.978
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

01:18:51.797 --> 01:18:52.761
Yeah, you.

01:18:54.211 --> 01:18:57.275
I don't know what your
reputation is in this town,

01:18:58.449 --> 01:19:00.354
but after the shit you
tried to pull today,

01:19:00.415 --> 01:19:01.821
you can bet I'll be
lookin' into you.

01:19:02.978 --> 01:19:03.732
Now,

01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:06.989
any business we have heretofore,

01:19:07.946 --> 01:19:09.990
you can speak with my
aforementioned attorney.

01:19:11.616 --> 01:19:12.636
Good day, gentlemen.

01:19:13.203 --> 01:19:14.783
And until that day comes,

01:19:15.873 --> 01:19:17.239
keep your ear to the grindstone.

01:19:31.923 --> 01:19:32.757
How's it goin'?

01:19:33.223 --> 01:19:33.670
Fine.

01:19:33.754 --> 01:19:34.364
Yeah.

01:19:36.314 --> 01:19:37.035
Good.

01:19:39.134 --> 01:19:40.361
-Want some help?
-No!

01:19:42.175 --> 01:19:43.579
Come on. Give me
one little peek,

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:43.989
No.

01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:44.888
and we'll go to
the batting cages.

01:19:47.339 --> 01:19:49.805
It is actually important
that I learn this.

01:19:51.061 --> 01:19:52.318
-It's really important...

01:19:52.807 --> 01:19:53.541
-All right.
-to me, okay?

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:54.906
All right.

01:19:56.979 --> 01:19:58.641
Why don't we just
hang out here all day?

01:19:58.702 --> 01:19:59.665
Yes, why don't we?

01:20:02.223 --> 01:20:04.407
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.

01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:08.661
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls,

01:20:10.789 --> 01:20:11.675
let me ask you a question.

01:20:12.269 --> 01:20:13.143
All right.

01:20:14.696 --> 01:20:16.657
Do you have a
photographic memory?

01:20:18.672 --> 01:20:20.281
I don't know. I just kind
of remember, you know?

01:20:20.342 --> 01:20:22.288
I mean, how do you
remember your phone number?

01:20:22.349 --> 01:20:23.506
You just do.

01:20:24.197 --> 01:20:25.881
Have you studied
organic chemistry?

01:20:26.171 --> 01:20:26.997
A little bit.

01:20:27.404 --> 01:20:28.574
Oh, just for fun?

01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:29.983
Yeah, for kicks.

01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:33.090
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:34.358
Are you mad?

01:20:35.712 --> 01:20:38.057
Have you completely
lost your mind?

01:20:38.405 --> 01:20:40.141
Nobody studies it for fun.

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:43.122
It's not a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

01:20:43.183 --> 01:20:44.872
-Someone like me?
-Yeah.

01:20:45.552 --> 01:20:47.190
Someone who divides their
time, fairly evenly,

01:20:47.267 --> 01:20:49.379
between batting cages and bars.

01:20:49.695 --> 01:20:51.792
I would hardly say
it was a necessity.

01:20:54.581 --> 01:20:57.180
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

01:20:57.263 --> 01:20:59.782
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

01:21:01.338 --> 01:21:02.192
And yet...

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:06.808
you do it so easily.
I don't understand.

01:21:07.322 --> 01:21:09.132
I don't understand
how your mind works.

01:21:09.193 --> 01:21:10.115
Did you play the piano?

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:11.982
I want to talk about this.

01:21:12.043 --> 01:21:14.286
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

01:21:14.628 --> 01:21:15.095
Yeah, a bit.

01:21:15.313 --> 01:21:18.363
All right. So when you look at a
piano, you see Mozart.

01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:19.758
I see 'Chopsticks'.

01:21:19.819 --> 01:21:21.998
All right, well,
Beethoven, okay?

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.206
He looked at a piano,

01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:26.057
and it just made sense to him.
He could just play.

01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:27.794
So what are you saying?
You play the piano?

01:21:27.855 --> 01:21:29.547
Not a lick. I look at a piano,

01:21:29.608 --> 01:21:32.174
I see a bunch of keys, three
pedals and a box of wood.

01:21:33.087 --> 01:21:34.274
But Beethoven, Mozart...

01:21:34.335 --> 01:21:35.934
They saw it. They
could just play.

01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:39.012
I couldn't paint you a picture.

01:21:39.073 --> 01:21:40.966
I probably can't hit
the ball out of Fenway.

01:21:41.406 --> 01:21:42.665
And I can't play the piano.

01:21:43.019 --> 01:21:45.357
But you can do my O-chem
paper in under an hour.

01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:49.395
Right. Well, I mean, when
it came to stuff like that,

01:21:49.456 --> 01:21:50.569
I could always just play.

01:21:53.593 --> 01:21:55.536
That's the best
I can explain it.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:57.545
Come here.

01:21:58.078 --> 01:21:59.214
I have to tell you something.

01:21:59.843 --> 01:22:00.930
I have to tell you something.

01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:03.313
Well...

01:22:19.241 --> 01:22:20.238
It's not fair.

01:22:20.506 --> 01:22:22.638
What's not fair? What?

01:22:23.965 --> 01:22:25.726
I've been here for four years,

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.654
and I've only just found you.

01:22:30.544 --> 01:22:31.854
Well, you found me.

01:22:44.809 --> 01:22:46.022
Are you awake?

01:22:46.869 --> 01:22:47.646
No.

01:22:50.064 --> 01:22:50.727
Yes, you are.

01:22:59.736 --> 01:23:00.378
What?

01:23:03.665 --> 01:23:05.671
I want you to come to
California with me.

01:23:11.484 --> 01:23:12.905
You sure about that?

01:23:13.591 --> 01:23:14.441
Oh, yeah.

01:23:16.328 --> 01:23:17.488
Yeah, but how do you know?

01:23:19.551 --> 01:23:20.311
I don't know.

01:23:21.977 --> 01:23:22.888
I just know.

01:23:23.525 --> 01:23:24.980
Yeah, but how do you know?

01:23:26.573 --> 01:23:28.313
I know, because...

01:23:29.558 --> 01:23:30.659
I feel it.

01:23:30.926 --> 01:23:33.191
Because that's a really
serious thing you're saying.

01:23:33.633 --> 01:23:34.573
I... I know.

01:23:34.634 --> 01:23:36.316
You could be in
California next week...

01:23:36.377 --> 01:23:39.546
and you might find out something
about me you don't like.

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:42.408
Maybe you wish you
hadn't said that,

01:23:42.475 --> 01:23:44.913
but you know it's such a serious
thing you can't take it back.

01:23:44.974 --> 01:23:46.598
Now I'm stuck in California

01:23:46.659 --> 01:23:47.909
with someone that doesn't
really want to be with me,

01:23:47.951 --> 01:23:49.381
just wish they had a take-back.

01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:50.420
A what?

01:23:50.796 --> 01:23:51.850
What's a take-back?

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.397
I don't want a take-back.

01:23:55.286 --> 01:23:57.351
I just want you to come
to California with me.

01:23:58.785 --> 01:24:01.934
Well, I can't go to
California with you, so...

01:24:04.677 --> 01:24:05.464
Why not?

01:24:06.037 --> 01:24:07.483
Well, one, because I...

01:24:07.744 --> 01:24:09.468
I got a job here.

01:24:09.871 --> 01:24:11.219
And, two, because I live here.

01:24:12.601 --> 01:24:13.793
Look, um,

01:24:15.007 --> 01:24:16.669
if you don't love me, you
should just tell me, because I...

01:24:16.730 --> 01:24:17.844
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

01:24:19.707 --> 01:24:20.620
Then why?

01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:22.234
Why won't you come?

01:24:22.762 --> 01:24:24.575
What are you so scared of?

01:24:25.349 --> 01:24:26.663
What am I so scared of?

01:24:27.136 --> 01:24:27.766
Well,

01:24:28.269 --> 01:24:29.417
what aren't you scared of?

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:33.077
You live in this safe little
world where no one challenges you,

01:24:33.138 --> 01:24:34.278
and you're scared shit
just to do anything that...

01:24:34.339 --> 01:24:37.380
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.

01:24:37.441 --> 01:24:38.924
I mean, you just want to have
your little fling

01:24:38.985 --> 01:24:40.317
with the guy from the
other side of town.

01:24:40.378 --> 01:24:41.684
Then you're gonna
go off to Stanford.

01:24:41.745 --> 01:24:43.325
You're gonna marry
some rich prick...

01:24:43.386 --> 01:24:44.791
who your parents
will approve of...

01:24:44.943 --> 01:24:46.744
and just sit around with the
other trust fund babies...

01:24:46.805 --> 01:24:49.003
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.

01:24:49.326 --> 01:24:50.880
Why are you saying this?

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:54.770
What is your obsession
with this money?

01:24:55.217 --> 01:24:58.405
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

01:24:59.765 --> 01:25:01.228
You don't think
every day I wake up,

01:25:02.051 --> 01:25:03.426
and I wish I could give it back.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.568
That I would give
it back in a second

01:25:06.881 --> 01:25:08.758
if it meant I could have
one more day with him.

01:25:08.864 --> 01:25:09.696
But I can't,

01:25:10.026 --> 01:25:11.709
and that's my life,
and I deal with it.

01:25:12.036 --> 01:25:13.773
So don't put your shit on me

01:25:13.834 --> 01:25:15.145
when you're the
one that's afraid.

01:25:15.206 --> 01:25:16.808
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?

01:25:16.869 --> 01:25:18.030
What the fuck am I afraid of?

01:25:18.097 --> 01:25:18.612
You're afraid of me.

01:25:18.673 --> 01:25:20.091
You're afraid that I
won't love you back.

01:25:20.411 --> 01:25:22.306
You know what? I'm afraid too.

01:25:23.086 --> 01:25:24.458
But fuck it, I want
to give it a shot.

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:26.217
At least I'm honest with you.

01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:27.506
I'm not honest with you?

01:25:27.567 --> 01:25:29.029
No, what about your 12 brothers?

01:25:30.361 --> 01:25:31.075
All right.

01:25:32.106 --> 01:25:34.234
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

01:25:34.472 --> 01:25:35.653
What do you want to know?

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:37.039
That I don't have 12 brothers?

01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:38.573
That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:40.499
-You don't want to hear that.
-I didn't know that.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.017
You don't want to hear
that I got fuckin'

01:25:42.078 --> 01:25:44.138
cigarettes put out on me
when I was a little kid.

01:25:44.199 --> 01:25:46.083
-I didn't know that.
-That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

01:25:46.144 --> 01:25:47.406
The mother fucker stabbed me.

01:25:47.467 --> 01:25:49.458
You don't want to hear
that shit, Skylar!

01:25:49.519 --> 01:25:51.711
-I do want to hear that.
-Don't tell me you want that shit!

01:25:51.788 --> 01:25:53.531
I want to hear because
I want to help you.

01:25:53.599 --> 01:25:54.966
-Because I want to be...
-Help me? What the fuck?

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:55.690
What do I got,

01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:58.028
a fuckin' sign on my back
that says, 'Save me'?

01:25:58.089 --> 01:25:59.804
-No.
-Do I look like I need that?

01:25:59.887 --> 01:26:02.285
-No, I just want to be with you.
-Don't bullshit me!

01:26:02.346 --> 01:26:03.077
I love you.

01:26:03.138 --> 01:26:05.741
Don't bullshit me! Don't
you fuckin' bullshit me!

01:26:06.798 --> 01:26:07.784
I love you.

01:26:10.575 --> 01:26:13.607
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

01:26:14.771 --> 01:26:16.498
Because if you say that...

01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:19.961
then I won't call you...

01:26:22.004 --> 01:26:24.293
and I won't be in your life.

01:26:31.563 --> 01:26:32.384
I don't love you.

01:27:14.411 --> 01:27:16.809
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

01:27:17.914 --> 01:27:19.714
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

01:27:20.742 --> 01:27:22.097
They get convinced
they're stupid.

01:27:24.433 --> 01:27:26.190
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing,

01:27:27.495 --> 01:27:29.811
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you,

01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:31.884
not against you.

01:27:37.028 --> 01:27:37.927
Hello, Will.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.347
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:42.861
Sure.

01:27:47.621 --> 01:27:48.956
Now, let's see.

01:27:55.473 --> 01:27:56.277
Good.

01:27:57.186 --> 01:27:58.513
This is correct.

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.950
I see you used Maclaurin here.

01:28:02.748 --> 01:28:04.518
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...

01:28:06.838 --> 01:28:08.265
This can't be right.

01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:13.286
This would be very embarrassing.

01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:19.727
-Did you ever consider...
-I'm pretty sure it's right.

01:28:20.376 --> 01:28:21.002
Hey, look,

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:23.124
can we do this at Sean's office
from now on? Because I...

01:28:23.617 --> 01:28:25.391
got to knock off
work to come here

01:28:25.452 --> 01:28:26.549
and the commute is killin' me.

01:28:26.704 --> 01:28:27.461
-Yeah, sure.

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:30.638
-Did you think of the possibility.
-That's right.

01:28:31.571 --> 01:28:32.186
It's right.

01:28:33.688 --> 01:28:34.841
Just take it home with you.

01:28:38.916 --> 01:28:40.436
What happened at
the McNeil meeting?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.372
I couldn't go. I had a date.

01:28:43.433 --> 01:28:45.943
So I sent my chief negotiator.

01:28:49.987 --> 01:28:52.297
On your own time, you can
do whatever you like, Will.

01:28:53.811 --> 01:28:55.334
But when I set up a meeting

01:28:55.621 --> 01:28:56.712
with my associates,

01:28:56.773 --> 01:28:58.918
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

01:28:59.056 --> 01:29:01.356
-Then don't set up any more meetings.
-I won't.

01:29:01.963 --> 01:29:02.843
I'll cancel 'em.

01:29:03.946 --> 01:29:05.263
I'll give you a job myself.

01:29:05.331 --> 01:29:07.136
I just wanted you to
see what was out there.

01:29:07.197 --> 01:29:08.627
Maybe I don't want
to spend the rest

01:29:08.693 --> 01:29:11.116
of my fuckin' life
explainin' shit to people.

01:29:18.455 --> 01:29:20.539
I think you could show
me some appreciation.

01:29:21.409 --> 01:29:22.677
A little appreciation?

01:29:23.151 --> 01:29:24.570
Do you know how
easy this is for me?

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.293
Do you have any fuckin'
idea how easy this is?

01:29:26.354 --> 01:29:27.625
This is a fuckin' joke.

01:29:28.169 --> 01:29:30.118
I'm sorry you can't do this.
I really am...

01:29:30.202 --> 01:29:31.736
Because I wouldn't have
to fuckin' sit here

01:29:31.797 --> 01:29:33.802
and watch you fumble
around and fuck it up.

01:29:39.566 --> 01:29:41.210
Then you'd have more
time to sit around

01:29:41.285 --> 01:29:42.757
and get drunk
instead, wouldn't you?

01:29:43.009 --> 01:29:43.727
You're right.

01:29:44.843 --> 01:29:46.664
This is probably a
total waste of my time.

01:30:01.927 --> 01:30:03.039
You're right, Will.

01:30:06.113 --> 01:30:07.322
I can't do this proof,

01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:13.066
but you can. And when it comes
to that, it's only about...

01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:15.464
just a handful of
people in the world...

01:30:15.525 --> 01:30:17.355
who can tell the difference
between you and me.

01:30:17.416 --> 01:30:19.172
-But I'm one of them.
-Sorry.

01:30:19.404 --> 01:30:20.512
Yeah, so am I.

01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:24.478
Most days I wish
I never met you,

01:30:27.853 --> 01:30:29.471
because then I could
sleep at night.

01:30:30.478 --> 01:30:32.823
I didn't have to walk
around with the knowledge

01:30:32.884 --> 01:30:34.665
that there was someone
like you out there.

01:30:41.785 --> 01:30:44.445
I didn't have to watch
you throw it all away.

01:30:52.167 --> 01:30:53.149
Bill, hold it.

01:30:54.963 --> 01:30:55.623
Did you hear that?

01:30:58.009 --> 01:30:58.843
Morgan!

01:31:00.435 --> 01:31:02.595
If you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again,

01:31:02.656 --> 01:31:04.120
I'm gonna give you
a fuckin' beatin'!

01:31:21.276 --> 01:31:22.331
What's up, fellas?

01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:27.146
Morgan, why don't you jerk
off in your own fuckin' house.

01:31:27.352 --> 01:31:28.707
That's fuckin' filthy.

01:31:28.887 --> 01:31:30.776
I don't have a V.C.R.
in my house.

01:31:33.156 --> 01:31:34.818
Come on. Not in my glove.

01:31:35.804 --> 01:31:37.754
I didn't use the glove.

01:31:38.335 --> 01:31:39.840
That's my Little League glove.

01:31:42.592 --> 01:31:43.765
What do you want me to do?

01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:46.842
I mean, what's wrong with you?

01:31:47.698 --> 01:31:49.637
You'll hump a baseball glove?

01:31:49.857 --> 01:31:52.914
I just used it for clean-up.

01:31:54.733 --> 01:31:56.826
Stop jerkin' off in
my mother's room.

01:31:56.887 --> 01:31:58.662
Is there another V.C.R.
in the house?

01:31:58.829 --> 01:32:00.103
It's just sad, bro.

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:03.499
So why do you
think I should work

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.985
for the National
Security Agency?

01:32:06.918 --> 01:32:09.132
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

01:32:10.096 --> 01:32:11.990
You'd be exposed to
the kind of technology

01:32:12.051 --> 01:32:13.432
you wouldn't see anywhere else,

01:32:13.493 --> 01:32:14.965
because we've classified it.

01:32:16.105 --> 01:32:18.405
Super-string theory, chaos math,

01:32:18.595 --> 01:32:20.409
-advanced algorithms.
-Code breaking.

01:32:23.048 --> 01:32:24.768
That's one aspect of what we do.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.852
Oh, come on. That
is what you do.

01:32:27.913 --> 01:32:30.574
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.

01:32:30.938 --> 01:32:33.028
You're seven times
the size of the C.I.A.

01:32:33.488 --> 01:32:35.384
We don't like to brag
about that, Will,

01:32:36.704 --> 01:32:37.965
but you're exactly right.

01:32:40.025 --> 01:32:41.242
So the way I see it,

01:32:41.781 --> 01:32:42.762
the question isn't:

01:32:43.387 --> 01:32:45.349
'Why should you work
for the N.S.A.?'

01:32:46.041 --> 01:32:46.918
The question is:

01:32:47.699 --> 01:32:48.579
'Why shouldn't you?'

01:32:49.406 --> 01:32:51.156
Why shouldn't I
work for the N.S.A.?

01:32:52.659 --> 01:32:53.683
That's a tough one,

01:32:54.953 --> 01:32:56.190
but I'll take a shot.

01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.084
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.

01:32:58.145 --> 01:32:59.690
and somebody puts
a code on my desk.

01:32:59.751 --> 01:33:01.156
Something no one else can break.

01:33:01.197 --> 01:33:03.219
Maybe I take a shot at
it and maybe I break it.

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:05.655
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

01:33:05.716 --> 01:33:06.915
But maybe that code
was the location

01:33:06.976 --> 01:33:09.396
of some rebel army in North
Africa or Middle East.

01:33:09.457 --> 01:33:10.826
Once they have that location,

01:33:10.887 --> 01:33:12.501
they bomb the village where
the rebels are hidin'.

01:33:12.806 --> 01:33:14.573
Fifteen hundred people
that I never met,

01:33:14.634 --> 01:33:16.075
never had no problem
with, get killed.

01:33:17.076 --> 01:33:18.560
Now the politicians are saying,

01:33:18.621 --> 01:33:20.224
'Send in the Marines
to secure the area,'

01:33:20.285 --> 01:33:21.314
'cause they don't give a shit.

01:33:21.509 --> 01:33:23.211
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot,

01:33:23.272 --> 01:33:24.911
just like it wasn't them
when their number got called

01:33:24.972 --> 01:33:26.915
'cause they were in
the National Guard.

01:33:27.183 --> 01:33:28.753
It'll be some kid from
Southie over there

01:33:28.814 --> 01:33:29.914
takin' shrapnel in the ass.

01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:32.298
He comes back to find the
plant he used to work at...

01:33:32.359 --> 01:33:34.724
got exported to the
country he got back from,

01:33:34.831 --> 01:33:37.135
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

01:33:37.196 --> 01:33:39.782
'cause he'll work for 15 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks.

01:33:40.068 --> 01:33:41.482
Meanwhile, he realizes
the only reason

01:33:41.543 --> 01:33:42.672
he was over there in
the first place...

01:33:42.733 --> 01:33:44.217
was so we could
install a government

01:33:44.278 --> 01:33:45.664
that would sell us
oil at a good price.

01:33:45.811 --> 01:33:47.773
Of course, the oil
companies used a skirmish

01:33:47.834 --> 01:33:49.632
over there to scare up
domestic oil prices.

01:33:49.693 --> 01:33:51.739
A cute little ancillary
benefit for them,

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.042
but it ain't helpin' my
buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

01:33:54.349 --> 01:33:56.504
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

01:33:56.565 --> 01:33:58.799
Maybe they even took the liberty
to hire an alcoholic skipper,

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:00.119
who likes to drink Martinis

01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:02.018
and fuckin' play slalom
with the icebergs.

01:34:02.165 --> 01:34:04.337
It ain't too long till he
hits one, spills the oil...

01:34:04.398 --> 01:34:06.449
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

01:34:07.005 --> 01:34:09.313
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive,

01:34:09.374 --> 01:34:11.066
so he's walkin' to the
fuckin' job interviews...

01:34:11.108 --> 01:34:12.785
which sucks because
the shrapnel in his ass

01:34:12.846 --> 01:34:14.102
is givin' him
chronic haemorrhoids.

01:34:14.163 --> 01:34:15.424
Meanwhile, he's starvin',

01:34:15.485 --> 01:34:16.824
'cause every time he tries
to get a bite to eat,

01:34:16.885 --> 01:34:18.491
the only blue plate
special they're servin'...

01:34:18.575 --> 01:34:20.389
is North Atlantic scrod
with Quaker State.

01:34:21.759 --> 01:34:22.763
So what did I think?

01:34:23.813 --> 01:34:25.422
I'm holdin' out for
somethin' better.

01:34:27.405 --> 01:34:28.253
I figure, fuck it.

01:34:28.314 --> 01:34:30.214
While I'm at it, why
not just shoot my buddy,

01:34:30.802 --> 01:34:32.675
take his job, give it
to his sworn enemy,

01:34:32.736 --> 01:34:35.509
hike up gas prices, bomb a
village, club a baby seal,

01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:37.487
hit the hash pipe and
join the National Guard?

01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:39.517
I can be elected president.

01:34:40.503 --> 01:34:41.857
You feel like
you're alone, Will?

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:43.816
What?

01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:46.285
Do you have a soul mate?

01:34:47.735 --> 01:34:49.375
Do I have a...? Define that.

01:34:50.563 --> 01:34:52.004
Somebody who challenges you.

01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:54.549
Uh, Chuckie.

01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:57.479
No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie
down in fuckin' traffic for you.

01:34:58.326 --> 01:35:00.792
I'm talking about someone
who opens up things for you,

01:35:00.853 --> 01:35:01.920
touches your soul.

01:35:04.148 --> 01:35:05.709
-I got... I got...
-Who?

01:35:07.498 --> 01:35:08.438
I got plenty.

01:35:08.771 --> 01:35:09.612
Well, name 'em.

01:35:10.421 --> 01:35:13.699
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.121
That's great. They're all dead.

01:35:15.827 --> 01:35:17.131
Not to me they're not.

01:35:17.294 --> 01:35:19.141
You don't have a lot
of dialogue with them.

01:35:20.221 --> 01:35:21.853
You can't give
back to them, Will.

01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:24.811
Not without some serious
smelling salts and a heater.

01:35:25.518 --> 01:35:27.092
That's what I'm saying.

01:35:28.409 --> 01:35:30.508
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

01:35:30.569 --> 01:35:32.655
where you're always afraid
to take the first step,

01:35:33.015 --> 01:35:35.664
because all you see is
every negative thing

01:35:35.725 --> 01:35:36.661
ten miles down the road.

01:35:36.744 --> 01:35:38.446
You gonna take the
professor's side on this?

01:35:38.507 --> 01:35:39.643
Don't give me a line of shit.
No.

01:35:39.704 --> 01:35:40.671
I didn't want the job.

01:35:40.732 --> 01:35:41.490
It's not about the job.

01:35:41.551 --> 01:35:42.794
I don't care if you
work for the government.

01:35:43.132 --> 01:35:44.965
But you can do
anything you want.

01:35:45.026 --> 01:35:46.193
You are bound by nothing.

01:35:47.713 --> 01:35:48.877
What are you passionate about?

01:35:49.904 --> 01:35:50.643
What do you want?

01:35:51.531 --> 01:35:53.626
There are guys who work their
entire life layin' brick...

01:35:53.687 --> 01:35:54.898
so their kids have a chance

01:35:54.959 --> 01:35:56.299
at the opportunities
you have here.

01:35:56.594 --> 01:35:58.253
-I didn't ask for this.
-No.

01:35:58.540 --> 01:35:59.350
You were born with it,

01:35:59.437 --> 01:36:01.554
so don't cop out behind:
'I didn't ask for this.'

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:02.684
-What do you mean, cop out?

01:36:02.745 --> 01:36:04.582
What's wrong with layin' brick?

01:36:04.941 --> 01:36:05.462
-Nothing.

01:36:05.542 --> 01:36:07.803
There's nothin' wrong. That's
somebody's home I'm buildin'.

01:36:07.883 --> 01:36:10.197
Right. My dad laid brick, okay?

01:36:10.805 --> 01:36:12.534
Busted his ass so I
could have an education.

01:36:12.595 --> 01:36:14.192
Exactly. That's an
honourable profession.

01:36:14.253 --> 01:36:16.172
What's wrong with
fixin' somebody's car?

01:36:16.233 --> 01:36:17.704
Someone will get to work
the next day because of me.

01:36:17.777 --> 01:36:18.881
That's honour in that.

01:36:18.942 --> 01:36:20.458
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honour in that.

01:36:20.542 --> 01:36:23.039
There's honour in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...

01:36:23.259 --> 01:36:24.455
so those college
kids could come in

01:36:24.516 --> 01:36:25.607
in the morning and
their floors are clean.

01:36:25.681 --> 01:36:27.571
And their waste baskets are empty.
That's real work.

01:36:27.661 --> 01:36:28.265
That's right.

01:36:28.326 --> 01:36:29.671
And that's honourable.

01:36:30.001 --> 01:36:31.618
I'm sure that's why
you took that job.

01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:32.995
I mean, for the honour of it.

01:36:33.977 --> 01:36:35.388
I just have a little
question here.

01:36:36.004 --> 01:36:37.750
You could be a janitor anywhere.

01:36:38.731 --> 01:36:40.554
Why did you work at
the most prestigious

01:36:40.615 --> 01:36:42.594
technical college in
the whole fuckin' world?

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:44.781
Why did you sneak
around at night

01:36:44.842 --> 01:36:45.921
and finish other
people's formulas...

01:36:45.982 --> 01:36:47.471
that only one or two
people in the world

01:36:47.532 --> 01:36:49.012
could do and then lie about it?

01:36:52.451 --> 01:36:54.401
'Cause I don't see a lot
of honour in that, Will.

01:36:58.084 --> 01:36:59.329
So what do you really wanna do?

01:37:04.731 --> 01:37:05.840
I wanna be a shepherd.

01:37:06.316 --> 01:37:06.959
Really?

01:37:07.802 --> 01:37:10.010
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread,

01:37:10.125 --> 01:37:11.598
get some sheep and tend to them.

01:37:12.157 --> 01:37:13.659
Maybe you should go do that.

01:37:13.805 --> 01:37:14.641
What?

01:37:15.067 --> 01:37:16.368
You know, if you're
gonna jerk off,

01:37:16.429 --> 01:37:17.952
why don't you just do it
at home with a moist towel?

01:37:18.013 --> 01:37:19.645
-You're chuckin' me?
-Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

01:37:19.706 --> 01:37:21.882
-No, no, no, time's not up yet.
-Yeah, it is.

01:37:21.943 --> 01:37:22.698
I'm not leavin'. No.

01:37:22.759 --> 01:37:24.881
You're not gonna answer,
you're wastin' my time.

01:37:24.942 --> 01:37:26.696
I thought we were friends.
What do you mean...

01:37:26.757 --> 01:37:27.701
Playtime's over, okay?

01:37:27.762 --> 01:37:30.090
Why are you kickin' me out, Sean?
I mean...

01:37:30.648 --> 01:37:32.124
You're lecturin' me on life?

01:37:32.185 --> 01:37:34.072
Look at you, you
fuckin' burnout.

01:37:34.192 --> 01:37:35.593
What winds your clock?

01:37:35.754 --> 01:37:36.589
Workin' with you.

01:37:36.683 --> 01:37:37.748
Where's your soul mate?

01:37:37.809 --> 01:37:39.693
You wanna talk about soul mates?
Where is she?

01:37:39.819 --> 01:37:41.914
-Dead.
-That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

01:37:41.975 --> 01:37:43.392
She fuckin' dies
and you just cash

01:37:43.453 --> 01:37:44.804
in your chips and you walk away?

01:37:44.944 --> 01:37:46.077
At least I played a hand.

01:37:46.138 --> 01:37:47.697
You played a hand and you lost.

01:37:47.758 --> 01:37:48.827
You lost a big fuckin' hand.

01:37:48.888 --> 01:37:50.488
Some people will lose
a big hand like that

01:37:50.549 --> 01:37:51.998
and have the sack
to ante up again.

01:37:52.425 --> 01:37:53.158
Look at me.

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:55.241
What do you wanna do?

01:38:02.413 --> 01:38:03.580
You and your bullshit.

01:38:04.266 --> 01:38:06.017
You got a bullshit
answer for everybody.

01:38:06.609 --> 01:38:08.440
But I ask you a
very simple question

01:38:08.538 --> 01:38:10.302
and you can't give
me a straight answer,

01:38:12.035 --> 01:38:13.187
because you don't know.

01:38:15.989 --> 01:38:17.047
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

01:38:21.008 --> 01:38:22.928
-Fuck you.
-You're the shepherd.

01:38:28.122 --> 01:38:29.215
Shepherd.

01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:31.938
White little prick.

01:38:33.932 --> 01:38:35.635
I just wanted to, you know, um,

01:38:35.793 --> 01:38:39.277
call you up, uh,
before you left, um...

01:38:39.610 --> 01:38:41.739
I've been takin' all these
jobs interviews and stuff,

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.760
so I'm not gonna be just
a construction worker.

01:38:43.957 --> 01:38:46.620
Well, you know, I never
really cared about that.

01:38:48.364 --> 01:38:49.100
Yeah.

01:38:53.598 --> 01:38:54.468
I love you.

01:39:00.074 --> 01:39:00.714
Will?

01:39:03.845 --> 01:39:04.616
You take care.

01:39:09.256 --> 01:39:09.949
Bye.

01:40:16.994 --> 01:40:17.607
Will!

01:40:20.110 --> 01:40:22.016
Will, that's it! We're done!

01:40:23.068 --> 01:40:25.056
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

01:40:27.106 --> 01:40:28.352
Well, it's ten past 5:00.

01:40:29.769 --> 01:40:31.714
An hour and ten minutes late.

01:40:35.027 --> 01:40:36.298
Well, if he doesn't show up

01:40:36.359 --> 01:40:37.992
and I file a report
saying he wasn't here...

01:40:38.075 --> 01:40:40.480
and he goes back to jail, he
won't be on my conscience.

01:40:45.197 --> 01:40:45.850
Okay.

01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:47.477
Fine.

01:40:50.184 --> 01:40:50.948
What's up?

01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:54.189
Thanks.

01:40:58.124 --> 01:40:58.714
Ah!

01:40:58.905 --> 01:41:01.025
God, that's good.

01:41:05.988 --> 01:41:06.901
So how's your lady?

01:41:08.372 --> 01:41:09.437
Ah, she's gone.

01:41:11.358 --> 01:41:12.513
Gone? Gone where?

01:41:13.989 --> 01:41:14.846
Med school.

01:41:15.122 --> 01:41:16.634
Medical school in California.

01:41:18.175 --> 01:41:19.156
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:20.040
When was this?

01:41:20.657 --> 01:41:21.634
It was, like, a week ago.

01:41:26.842 --> 01:41:27.834
That sucks.

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:33.443
So, uh, when are you
done with those meetings?

01:41:35.351 --> 01:41:37.182
I think the week after I'm 21.

01:41:37.313 --> 01:41:39.346
They gonna hook ya up
with a job or what?

01:41:40.217 --> 01:41:42.142
Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room

01:41:42.203 --> 01:41:44.218
and do long division
for the next 50 years.

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.955
Nah, probably make
some nice bank though.

01:41:47.989 --> 01:41:49.821
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

01:41:49.968 --> 01:41:50.912
Better than this shit.

01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:52.357
Way outta here.

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:55.536
What do I want a
way outta here for?

01:41:55.619 --> 01:41:57.556
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'
live here the rest of my life.

01:41:58.158 --> 01:42:00.317
You know, be neighbours.
You know, have little kids.

01:42:00.378 --> 01:42:02.882
Fuckin' take 'em to Little
League together up Foley Field.

01:42:06.517 --> 01:42:09.470
Look, you're my best friend, so
don't take this the wrong way.

01:42:10.016 --> 01:42:12.608
But in 20 years if
you're still livin' here,

01:42:13.034 --> 01:42:14.993
comin' over to my house to
watch the Patriots games,

01:42:15.054 --> 01:42:17.348
still workin' construction,
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

01:42:18.667 --> 01:42:20.980
That's not a threat. That's a fact.
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

01:42:21.378 --> 01:42:22.630
What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

01:42:23.516 --> 01:42:24.106
Look,

01:42:24.724 --> 01:42:26.254
you got something
none of us have.

01:42:26.315 --> 01:42:27.827
Oh, come on! Why
is it always this?

01:42:27.888 --> 01:42:29.889
I mean, I fuckin' owe it to
myself to do this or that.

01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:30.666
What if I don't want to?

01:42:30.727 --> 01:42:33.777
No, no, no. Fuck you. You
don't owe it to yourself.

01:42:34.984 --> 01:42:35.879
You owe it to me,

01:42:37.255 --> 01:42:39.302
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50,

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.563
and I'll still be
doin' this shit.

01:42:42.821 --> 01:42:44.337
That's all right. That's fine.

01:42:44.922 --> 01:42:46.689
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

01:42:47.697 --> 01:42:49.543
You're too much of a
pussy to cash it in,

01:42:50.406 --> 01:42:51.281
and that's bullshit.

01:42:53.546 --> 01:42:56.015
'Cause I'd do fuckin'
anything to have what you got.

01:42:56.376 --> 01:42:58.339
So would any of
these fuckin' guys.

01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:01.858
Be an insult to us if you're
still here in 20 years.

01:43:02.091 --> 01:43:04.112
Hangin' around here is a
fuckin' waste of your time.

01:43:05.261 --> 01:43:06.878
-You don't know that.
-I don't?

01:43:06.991 --> 01:43:08.906
-No. You don't know that.
-Oh, I don't know that.

01:43:09.164 --> 01:43:10.242
Let me tell you what I do know.

01:43:11.223 --> 01:43:13.726
Every day I come by your
house, and I pick you up.

01:43:14.394 --> 01:43:16.119
We go out and have a few drinks

01:43:16.262 --> 01:43:17.929
and few laughs, and it's great.

01:43:18.552 --> 01:43:20.233
You know what the best
part of my day is?

01:43:21.346 --> 01:43:22.450
It's for about ten seconds:

01:43:22.511 --> 01:43:25.125
from when I pull up to the curb
and when I get to your door.

01:43:25.689 --> 01:43:27.073
'Cause I think maybe
I'll get up there

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:28.798
and I'll knock on the door
and you won't be there.

01:43:30.602 --> 01:43:32.760
No 'good-bye', no 'see ya later'.
No nothing.

01:43:33.103 --> 01:43:33.810
You just left.

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.533
I don't know much,
but I know that.

01:43:50.957 --> 01:43:52.477
This is a disaster, Sean.

01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:54.438
I brought you in here because

01:43:54.499 --> 01:43:55.980
I wanted you to help
me with the boy,

01:43:56.177 --> 01:43:57.864
-not to run him out.
-I know what I'm doing with the boy.

01:43:57.925 --> 01:43:59.588
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!

01:43:59.672 --> 01:44:01.727
I don't care if you have a few
laughs, even at my expense.

01:44:01.788 --> 01:44:04.210
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:04.980
Undermine?

01:44:05.863 --> 01:44:07.462
This boy is at a
fragile point right now.

01:44:07.523 --> 01:44:10.727
I do understand. He is at a fragile point.
Okay? He's got problems.

01:44:10.788 --> 01:44:12.064
What problems does
he have, Sean?

01:44:12.125 --> 01:44:14.744
That he's better off as a janitor,
that he is better off in jail?

01:44:14.805 --> 01:44:17.367
Better hanging out with a
bunch of retarded gorillas?

01:44:17.428 --> 01:44:19.503
Why do you think he
does that, Gerry?

01:44:19.564 --> 01:44:21.052
You have any fuckin' clue why?

01:44:21.559 --> 01:44:22.734
He can handle the problems.

01:44:22.795 --> 01:44:25.207
He can handle the work.
He obviously handled you.

01:44:25.268 --> 01:44:27.453
Gerry, Listen. Listen to me.
Why is he hiding?

01:44:27.514 --> 01:44:28.875
Why doesn't he trust anybody?

01:44:29.231 --> 01:44:30.656
Because the first thing
that happened to him,

01:44:30.717 --> 01:44:31.956
he was abandoned by the people

01:44:32.017 --> 01:44:33.146
who were supposed to
love him the most.

01:44:33.213 --> 01:44:34.703
Come on. Don't give
me that Freudian crap.

01:44:34.764 --> 01:44:36.377
Oh, no. Listen Gerry,
why does he hang out with those

01:44:36.438 --> 01:44:37.987
retarded gorillas,
as you call them?

01:44:38.223 --> 01:44:40.002
Because any one of them,
if he asked them to,

01:44:40.063 --> 01:44:41.893
would take a fucking
bat to your head. Okay?

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.249
-That's called loyalty.
-Yeah, that's very touching.

01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:45.128
And, who's he handling?

01:44:45.404 --> 01:44:46.753
He pushes people away

01:44:46.814 --> 01:44:48.429
before they have a
chance to leave him.

01:44:48.666 --> 01:44:50.478
It's a defence
mechanism, all right?

01:44:50.628 --> 01:44:53.038
For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

01:44:53.708 --> 01:44:55.004
If you push him right now,

01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:56.315
it's gonna be the same
thing all over again.

01:44:56.376 --> 01:44:58.328
And I'm not gonna let
that happen to him.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.030
-Don't you do that, Sean.
-What?

01:45:00.113 --> 01:45:02.081
Don't you do that. Don't
infect him with the idea

01:45:02.142 --> 01:45:04.686
that it's okay to quit, that
it's okay to be a failure.

01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:05.912
Because it's not okay, Sean!

01:45:06.267 --> 01:45:08.562
And if you're angry at
me for being successful,

01:45:08.623 --> 01:45:09.827
for being what you
could have been...

01:45:09.888 --> 01:45:12.669
-I'm not angry at you.
-Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean.

01:45:12.953 --> 01:45:14.100
You resent me,

01:45:14.473 --> 01:45:17.574
but I'm not gonna apologize
for any success I've had.

01:45:18.114 --> 01:45:19.898
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!

01:45:19.959 --> 01:45:21.157
But ask yourself,
Sean, ask yourself...

01:45:21.737 --> 01:45:24.059
ask yourself, if you want
Will to feel that way,

01:45:24.406 --> 01:45:25.969
if you want him to
feel like a failure?

01:45:26.262 --> 01:45:27.477
You arrogant shit!

01:45:27.822 --> 01:45:29.965
That's why I don't come
to the goddamn reunions,

01:45:30.478 --> 01:45:32.312
'cause I can't stand
that look in your eye.

01:45:32.738 --> 01:45:34.572
You know, that condescending,
embarrassed look.

01:45:34.633 --> 01:45:35.467
Oh, come on, Sean.

01:45:35.528 --> 01:45:37.775
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

01:45:37.836 --> 01:45:39.187
I'm proud of what I do.

01:45:39.317 --> 01:45:41.784
It was a conscious choice.
I didn't fuck up!

01:45:42.519 --> 01:45:44.766
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

01:45:45.073 --> 01:45:46.475
You and your kiss-ass chorus

01:45:46.695 --> 01:45:48.831
following you around going, 'The
Field's medal!', The Field's Medal!'

01:45:48.959 --> 01:45:51.712
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?

01:45:51.795 --> 01:45:53.687
It's about my medal, isn't it?

01:45:53.748 --> 01:45:55.906
Oh, God, I could go home and get it for you.
You can have it.

01:45:55.973 --> 01:45:57.384
Oh, please don't. You know what!

01:45:57.452 --> 01:45:59.238
Shove the medal up your
fuckin' ass, all right?

01:45:59.299 --> 01:46:00.762
'Cause I don't give a
shit about your medal,

01:46:00.823 --> 01:46:03.641
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god,

01:46:03.934 --> 01:46:05.494
when you were
pimple-faced and homesick

01:46:05.555 --> 01:46:06.793
and didn't know what side
of the bed to piss on.

01:46:06.854 --> 01:46:07.892
Yeah, you were
smarter than me then

01:46:07.953 --> 01:46:09.234
and you're smarter than me now.

01:46:09.295 --> 01:46:11.328
So don't blame me for how your
life turned out. It's not my fault.

01:46:11.389 --> 01:46:13.814
I don't blame you!
It's not about you!

01:46:13.875 --> 01:46:15.166
You mathematical dick!

01:46:15.359 --> 01:46:16.599
It's about the boy!

01:46:16.885 --> 01:46:19.666
He's a good kid! And I
won't see you fuck him up

01:46:19.784 --> 01:46:21.579
like you're tryin' to
fuck up me right now.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.870
I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!

01:46:23.931 --> 01:46:25.490
He won't be a failure!

01:46:25.557 --> 01:46:28.292
But if you push him, Gerry,
if you ride him...

01:46:28.433 --> 01:46:31.417
I am what I am today
because I was pushed

01:46:31.478 --> 01:46:33.006
and because I learned
to push myself.

01:46:33.067 --> 01:46:34.453
He's not you! You get that!

01:46:38.688 --> 01:46:40.275
-I can come back.
-No, come in. Uh...

01:46:41.138 --> 01:46:42.130
I was just leaving.

01:46:53.888 --> 01:46:56.730
A lot of that stuff goes back
a long way between me and him.

01:46:57.682 --> 01:46:58.449
You know.

01:46:59.016 --> 01:46:59.839
Not about you.

01:47:05.392 --> 01:47:06.378
What is that?

01:47:07.192 --> 01:47:08.087
This is your file.

01:47:08.499 --> 01:47:10.757
I have to send it back to
the judge for evaluation.

01:47:11.223 --> 01:47:11.699
Oh.

01:47:14.236 --> 01:47:15.492
Hey, you're not gonna
fail me, are you?

01:47:20.095 --> 01:47:20.941
What's it say?

01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:24.077
Wanna read it?

01:47:24.729 --> 01:47:25.437
Why?

01:47:28.572 --> 01:47:29.623
Have you had any, uh,

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:31.414
experience with that?

01:47:31.759 --> 01:47:32.788
Twenty years of counselling.

01:47:32.911 --> 01:47:34.491
Yeah, I've seen some
pretty awful shit.

01:47:35.767 --> 01:47:36.856
I mean, have you had any

01:47:37.982 --> 01:47:39.067
experience with that?

01:47:43.281 --> 01:47:43.975
Personally?

01:47:45.721 --> 01:47:46.308
Yeah.

01:47:47.126 --> 01:47:47.956
Yeah, I have.

01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:50.473
It sure ain't good.

01:47:55.009 --> 01:47:56.285
My father was an alcoholic.

01:47:57.039 --> 01:47:58.488
Mean fuckin' drunk.

01:48:00.862 --> 01:48:01.808
He'd come home hammered,

01:48:01.869 --> 01:48:03.373
lookin' to whale on somebody.

01:48:03.915 --> 01:48:05.450
So I'd provoke him so he

01:48:05.786 --> 01:48:07.444
wouldn't go after my
mother and little brother.

01:48:09.448 --> 01:48:11.537
Interesting nights
when he wore his rings.

01:48:14.169 --> 01:48:15.668
-Yeah.
-He used to just put a...

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:19.055
a wrench, a stick and a belt

01:48:19.388 --> 01:48:21.522
on the table. Just
say, 'Choose'.

01:48:22.742 --> 01:48:23.915
Well, I gotta go
with the belt there.

01:48:23.976 --> 01:48:25.937
I used to go with the wrench.

01:48:26.688 --> 01:48:27.541
Why the wrench?

01:48:28.673 --> 01:48:30.101
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

01:48:30.857 --> 01:48:31.749
Your foster father?

01:48:32.593 --> 01:48:33.228
Yeah.

01:48:34.306 --> 01:48:35.991
So, uh, what is it, like,

01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:39.401
Will has an attachment disorder?
Is it all that stuff?

01:48:41.288 --> 01:48:42.274
Fear of abandonment?

01:48:43.969 --> 01:48:44.775
Is that why I...

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:46.848
Is that why I broke
up with Skylar?

01:48:47.535 --> 01:48:48.520
I didn't know you had.

01:48:48.838 --> 01:48:49.556
Yeah, I did.

01:48:50.758 --> 01:48:52.380
-You wanna talk about it?
-No.

01:48:56.638 --> 01:48:57.398
Hey, Will,

01:48:59.318 --> 01:49:00.420
I don't know a lot.

01:49:02.747 --> 01:49:03.585
You see this?

01:49:04.502 --> 01:49:05.485
All this shit?

01:49:10.873 --> 01:49:12.137
It's not your fault.

01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:16.581
Yeah, I know that.

01:49:17.393 --> 01:49:18.355
Look at me, son.

01:49:20.695 --> 01:49:21.689
It's not your fault.

01:49:22.969 --> 01:49:23.708
I know.

01:49:24.092 --> 01:49:24.778
No.

01:49:25.288 --> 01:49:26.500
It's not your fault.

01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:30.920
I know.

01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:32.039
No, no, you don't.

01:49:32.606 --> 01:49:33.739
It's not your fault.

01:49:36.586 --> 01:49:37.478
I know.

01:49:37.539 --> 01:49:38.488
It's not your fault.

01:49:38.762 --> 01:49:39.486
All right.

01:49:39.935 --> 01:49:41.277
It's not your fault.

01:49:44.559 --> 01:49:45.880
It's not your fault.

01:49:46.264 --> 01:49:47.446
Don't fuck with me.

01:49:51.306 --> 01:49:52.369
It's not your fault.

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:54.294
Don't fuck with me, all right?

01:49:54.355 --> 01:49:55.619
Don't fuck with
me, Sean, not you.

01:49:55.703 --> 01:49:57.062
It's not your fault.

01:50:04.019 --> 01:50:05.003
It's not your fault.

01:50:14.147 --> 01:50:15.427
My God...

01:50:17.333 --> 01:50:20.561
My God! I'm so sorry! My God!

01:50:35.814 --> 01:50:36.975
Fuck them, okay?

01:52:04.182 --> 01:52:05.015
Can I help you?

01:52:05.352 --> 01:52:07.818
Yeah, I'm Will Hunting.
I'm here about a position.

01:52:08.481 --> 01:52:09.889
Could you just have
a seat for a moment?

01:52:14.042 --> 01:52:16.548
Yes, there's a Mr. Hunting
in the lobby.

01:52:38.439 --> 01:52:39.279
Which one did you take?

01:52:40.018 --> 01:52:41.733
I was over at McNeil.

01:52:41.794 --> 01:52:44.149
It's one of the jobs the
professor set me up with.

01:52:45.185 --> 01:52:46.534
I haven't told him yet,

01:52:46.595 --> 01:52:49.143
but I went down there
and talked to my boss...

01:52:49.447 --> 01:52:51.360
My new boss. He seemed
like a good guy.

01:52:52.934 --> 01:52:53.905
Is that what you want?

01:52:55.594 --> 01:52:57.115
Yeah, you know, I think so.

01:52:58.450 --> 01:53:01.198
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

01:53:01.614 --> 01:53:02.370
Thanks.

01:53:06.714 --> 01:53:07.503
Time's up.

01:53:11.604 --> 01:53:14.098
So that's... so that's it?
So we're done?

01:53:14.797 --> 01:53:15.523
Yeah, that's it.

01:53:17.609 --> 01:53:18.278
You're done.

01:53:18.696 --> 01:53:19.645
You're a free man.

01:53:21.739 --> 01:53:22.853
Well, um,

01:53:24.241 --> 01:53:26.534
I just want you to
know, Sean, that...

01:53:26.595 --> 01:53:27.550
You're welcome, Will.

01:53:33.947 --> 01:53:36.993
So, you know, I hope we
keep in touch, you know.

01:53:37.434 --> 01:53:38.274
Yeah, me too.

01:53:39.485 --> 01:53:40.925
I'll be travelin' around a bit.

01:53:40.986 --> 01:53:42.166
It'll be a little
hard, but, uh...

01:53:42.246 --> 01:53:43.731
I've got an answering machine

01:53:43.822 --> 01:53:45.439
at the college I'll
be checking in with.

01:53:48.702 --> 01:53:49.577
So, here's the number.

01:53:49.638 --> 01:53:51.980
You call that. I'll get
back to you right away.

01:53:53.843 --> 01:53:56.481
Yeah, you know, I
figured I'm just gonna...

01:53:56.801 --> 01:53:58.111
put my money back on the table

01:53:58.172 --> 01:53:59.656
and see what kind
of cards I get.

01:54:02.765 --> 01:54:04.761
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

01:54:10.336 --> 01:54:11.543
Thank you, Sean.

01:54:12.862 --> 01:54:13.809
Thank you, Will.

01:54:16.303 --> 01:54:19.242
Hey, does this violate the
patient-doctor relationship?

01:54:19.613 --> 01:54:21.502
Naw. Only if you grab my ass.

01:54:25.577 --> 01:54:26.217
Take care.

01:54:27.204 --> 01:54:27.806
You too.

01:54:27.902 --> 01:54:28.591
Yeah.

01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:31.605
Hey.

01:54:34.028 --> 01:54:34.897
Good luck, son.

01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:48.080
Two beers.

01:54:53.774 --> 01:54:54.751
What's up? Did you guys go?

01:54:54.812 --> 01:54:56.343
No. I had to talk him down.

01:54:56.909 --> 01:54:58.022
Why didn't you yoke him?

01:54:58.641 --> 01:55:00.621
Little Morgan's got a
lot of scrap to him.

01:55:00.992 --> 01:55:02.818
People try to whip
his ass every week.

01:55:03.051 --> 01:55:04.340
Fuckin' kid won't back down.

01:55:04.407 --> 01:55:05.401
What are you sayin' about me?

01:55:05.588 --> 01:55:06.661
Was I talkin' to you?

01:55:07.624 --> 01:55:08.713
None of your fuckin' business.

01:55:09.932 --> 01:55:12.050
-Go get me a beer.
-I ordered two beers!

01:55:12.746 --> 01:55:14.748
-Hey, ass hole.
-What, bitch?

01:55:14.809 --> 01:55:15.725
Happy birthday.

01:55:15.995 --> 01:55:17.396
Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

01:55:17.711 --> 01:55:20.470
-Come on!
-I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

01:55:21.522 --> 01:55:22.687
All right. Who's first?

01:55:23.012 --> 01:55:25.432
-Come on, mother fucker!
-Who's first?

01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:29.193
Here's your present.

01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.360
-Come on, bro.
-What?

01:55:32.881 --> 01:55:34.789
Well, we knew you
had to get back

01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:37.097
and forth to Cambridge
for your new job.

01:55:37.539 --> 01:55:39.963
I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin'
drive you every day, so...

01:55:41.829 --> 01:55:43.215
Morgan wanted to
get you a 'T' pass.

01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:44.569
That's not what I was sayin'!

01:55:45.462 --> 01:55:46.408
But, uh,

01:55:47.081 --> 01:55:47.840
you're 21 now.

01:55:47.923 --> 01:55:49.429
You're legally allowed to drink,

01:55:49.490 --> 01:55:51.644
so we figured the best
thing for ya was a car.

01:55:51.705 --> 01:55:52.396
How do you like it?

01:55:53.116 --> 01:55:53.876
This is like...

01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:59.184
It's the ugliest fuckin' car
I've ever seen in my life.

01:56:01.319 --> 01:56:03.307
-Come on, brother.
-How'd you guys do this?

01:56:04.167 --> 01:56:04.828
You know,

01:56:05.155 --> 01:56:07.459
me and Bill scraped
together the parts, and...

01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:10.094
Morgan was out panhandlin'
for change every day.

01:56:10.155 --> 01:56:11.796
I had the router to
do all the bodywork.

01:56:11.857 --> 01:56:13.385
Yeah, I have a fuckin'
job, too, brother.

01:56:13.446 --> 01:56:14.516
Guy's been up my
ass for two years

01:56:14.577 --> 01:56:16.185
about a job. I had to let
him help with the car.

01:56:16.246 --> 01:56:18.149
So you finally got
a job, huh, Morgan?

01:56:18.214 --> 01:56:20.181
Yeah, had one. Now
I'm fucked again.

01:56:20.357 --> 01:56:22.642
So what is it? A lawn mower?
What do ya got?

01:56:22.703 --> 01:56:23.859
It's a straight fuckin' six.

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.881
Me and Bill rebuilt this
engine ourselves here.

01:56:25.942 --> 01:56:28.617
It's a good car. The engine's good.
Engine's good.

01:56:29.953 --> 01:56:31.058
Happy 21, Will.

01:56:32.271 --> 01:56:33.237
Happy 21, brother.

01:56:41.752 --> 01:56:42.367
Hi.

01:56:43.948 --> 01:56:44.715
Come on in.

01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:50.140
Sean, I, um...

01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:51.493
Me too, Gerry.

01:56:53.011 --> 01:56:53.996
Yeah. Good.

01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:58.292
I heard you're takin' some time.

01:56:58.376 --> 01:56:59.061
Yeah.

01:56:59.407 --> 01:57:01.084
Travel a little bit,

01:57:01.664 --> 01:57:02.633
maybe write.

01:57:03.322 --> 01:57:04.135
So where are you going?

01:57:04.978 --> 01:57:05.949
India and...

01:57:06.522 --> 01:57:07.366
China...

01:57:07.952 --> 01:57:08.913
and Baltimore.

01:57:12.774 --> 01:57:13.907
You know when you'll be back?

01:57:14.285 --> 01:57:14.937
Oh.

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:17.961
I got this flyer the other day.

01:57:18.411 --> 01:57:21.372
It says, uh, class of '72 is
having a reunion in six months.

01:57:21.433 --> 01:57:22.860
Yeah, I got one of those too.

01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:24.863
Why don't you come?
I'll buy ya a drink.

01:57:26.112 --> 01:57:27.825
The drinks at those
things are free.

01:57:29.361 --> 01:57:31.370
I know, Gerry. I
was being ironical.

01:57:38.724 --> 01:57:40.246
How about a drink right now?

01:57:41.338 --> 01:57:42.799
Yeah. It's a good idea.

01:57:43.187 --> 01:57:44.700
Come on. This one's on me.

01:57:48.339 --> 01:57:50.285
I got the winner
right here, pal.

01:57:50.507 --> 01:57:52.509
Yes, sir, this is the one.

01:57:54.146 --> 01:57:56.073
This is my ticket to paradise.

01:57:56.134 --> 01:57:57.384
Sean, do you know
what the odds are

01:57:57.445 --> 01:57:58.533
against winning the lottery?

01:57:58.594 --> 01:58:01.425
-What? Four to one?
-About 30 million to one.

01:58:01.817 --> 01:58:03.138
I still have a shot, you know?

01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:04.522
Yes,

01:58:04.828 --> 01:58:07.111
just about as big
chance as you being hit

01:58:07.172 --> 01:58:09.406
by lightning here on
the staircase right now.

01:58:09.467 --> 01:58:11.271
It's a possibility too. I mean,

01:58:11.332 --> 01:58:12.852
32 million. If you
look at the size...

01:59:42.633 --> 01:59:43.373
Will!

02:00:04.073 --> 02:00:04.581
Will?

02:01:13.917 --> 02:01:14.783
He's not there.

02:01:36.508 --> 02:01:37.501
Sean,

02:01:37.948 --> 02:01:39.818
if the professor
calls about that job,

02:01:39.879 --> 02:01:41.248
just tell him sorry,

02:01:42.068 --> 02:01:43.630
I had to go see about a girl.

02:01:44.648 --> 02:01:45.233
Will.

02:01:47.624 --> 02:01:48.917
Son of a bitch.

02:01:49.584 --> 02:01:50.687
He stole my line.
