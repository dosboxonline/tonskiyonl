01:13.551 --> 01:16.250
This reminds me
of the Bell heist!

01:16.337 --> 01:19.253
Three months of planning.
Supposed to be quick and easy.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.646
<i>But as always,</i>

01:21.733 --> 01:23.387
ended in a shoot-out.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.294
We got five minutes,
bring her in!

02:01.121 --> 02:03.123
Tank, we're under attack!

02:06.735 --> 02:07.823
Take her down.

02:13.481 --> 02:14.960

02:15.047 --> 02:16.397
Never better.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.619
Oh... Not today.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.538
Glitching out!

03:54.190 --> 03:55.452
Do what you do best.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.579
Kid, you know
what this reminds me of?

04:37.059 --> 04:38.234
Bad timing?

04:57.384 --> 04:58.602
Shit.

05:12.747 --> 05:13.835
Whoa!

05:25.281 --> 05:26.456
Tank!

05:30.939 --> 05:32.027
Tank, come on!

05:49.000 --> 05:50.219
I don't want to die.

06:02.187 --> 06:03.667
Hey, kid!

06:16.898 --> 06:17.986
I told you.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.119
Always ends in a shoot-out.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.733
Nice day, isn't it?

06:27.125 --> 06:28.170
Huh?

06:35.525 --> 06:36.526
Your choice, son.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.922
We're gonna smoke
this thing together either way.

06:46.928 --> 06:47.972
Get fast.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.281
You get gone, huh?

06:55.850 --> 06:57.591
See you on the other side!

07:18.655 --> 07:21.005
Oh, you're a real pain in my--

08:12.796 --> 08:14.711
Hey, kid!

08:14.798 --> 08:16.670
You forgetting something?

08:25.896 --> 08:26.984
Tank's down.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.509
Find Sly.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.694
Guys.

08:40.781 --> 08:44.175
Delivery was promised
in 40 minutes or less.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.378
No!

09:13.465 --> 09:16.556
Cops!

09:16.643 --> 09:18.862
All right, move! Hurry!
Let's go, let's go!

09:23.388 --> 09:24.912
Drop your weapons!

10:01.688 --> 10:03.472
- Cover me!
- Get cover.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.520
Where's the backup?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.095
On your left, yeah!

10:48.473 --> 10:49.649
Behind you!

10:54.871 --> 10:55.872
Run!

10:59.571 --> 11:02.357
Run, kid, run!

11:08.668 --> 11:10.234
Get your hands off of me!

11:20.636 --> 11:22.246
Hands behind your head!

11:36.043 --> 11:37.174
We've informed your boss

11:37.261 --> 11:39.220
that you've rolled
for a reduced sentence.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.091
And you know Nushi's temper.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.703
Probably won't take
too kindly to a rat.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.055
We throw you in jail.

11:48.142 --> 11:51.536
Oh, they're gonna love
that pretty face of yours.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.060
We toss you out on the streets.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.801
Then you're
most definitely dead.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.193
Definitely.

11:59.631 --> 12:00.632
Who has the money?

12:04.419 --> 12:06.029
Why should I tell you?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.378
- Bullet in the face, right now.
- Hmm.

12:08.466 --> 12:09.685
No, not quite yet.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.906
How about this...

12:12.993 --> 12:14.690
First, you help me
locate my money,

12:14.777 --> 12:17.258
and then I'll cut you in
on a share of the pie.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.220
Thoughts?

12:27.529 --> 12:29.183
I think...

12:30.837 --> 12:34.623
I hate the idea
of working with you two.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.671
How long before we need
to worry about Nushi?

12:46.504 --> 12:47.723
Oh, yes.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.856
Not long.

12:49.943 --> 12:53.033
If she's sending
who I think she's sending.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.701
Just leave your laundry
in the bin.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.142
Afternoon, Mrs. Murphy.

13:15.229 --> 13:18.058
You are looking
as lovely as always.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.759
Hey, hey, looky here, huh?

13:23.846 --> 13:26.283
I got out that stain
just like you said.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.851
I mean, boy howdy,
it put up a fight,

13:28.938 --> 13:30.418
but I got the best of it.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.334
Now...

13:33.421 --> 13:37.773
I know that you know
I'm here on business.

13:43.474 --> 13:44.649
Mrs. Murphy.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.914
Mrs. Murphy?

13:48.001 --> 13:50.612
Oh, come on, Mrs. Murphy,
don't make me chase you!

13:50.699 --> 13:51.700
Dagnabbit.

13:54.442 --> 13:57.140
Mrs. Murphy, please
don't make this difficult.

13:58.968 --> 14:02.537
Mrs. Murphy,
I don't want to hurt you.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.408
Ah-ah-ah-ah...

14:10.327 --> 14:12.634
But I will if I have to.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.810
Now, please mind your manners.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.290
She just wants to chat.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.380

but you have to put this on.

14:28.693 --> 14:29.999
Yeah.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.958
Nushi likes her secrecy.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.698
What's that?

14:33.785 --> 14:36.484
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the duct tape
was my call 'cause I didn't want

14:36.571 --> 14:39.008
to argue all damn day.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.271
Yeah, thank you.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.148
No...

14:49.062 --> 14:50.411
it's not time yet.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.195
Go play.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.521
I promised our father

15:13.608 --> 15:15.915
to uphold
the stature of our family.

15:26.490 --> 15:27.578
Instead...

15:30.712 --> 15:33.106
you have brought failure
to our name.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.471
My sweet brother.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.956
The strongest of us all.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.613
Nushi, it's time.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.400
Where is my money?

16:09.533 --> 16:11.971
We... don't know yet.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.241
Yes.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.503
Nush!

16:22.590 --> 16:24.070
Hey.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.897
So, I got the old lady,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.639
and I figure I can wrangle
the other two by...

16:28.726 --> 16:32.252
Oh, I don't know...
let's say five o'clock?

16:32.339 --> 16:33.688
<i>I thought we could do
all three of them together</i>

16:33.775 --> 16:35.429
<i>seeing as
you're a busy lady and all.</i>

16:35.516 --> 16:36.996
That's fine.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.128
Great, so shall we meet
at the HQ?

16:44.568 --> 16:45.613
No.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.095
Bring them to the Dustbin.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.400
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

16:52.402 --> 16:54.013
Uh...

16:54.100 --> 16:55.405
the Dustbin, huh?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.584
Well, you see, I, uh...

17:00.671 --> 17:04.980
I-I sort of implied that you'd
just be talking to Mrs. Murphy.

17:05.067 --> 17:08.853
<i>I'll be waiting
for you there at 7:00 sharp.</i>

17:08.940 --> 17:11.726
<i>Do not call me "Nush."</i>

17:21.823 --> 17:23.520
I will do what you cannot.

17:25.305 --> 17:28.917

18:12.961 --> 18:14.397
Not wise, hombre.

18:14.484 --> 18:17.183
There's nothing but desert
for miles out here.

18:17.270 --> 18:20.099
You got better odds
with Nushi, maybe.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.144
All right.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.580
Let's go face the music.

18:25.713 --> 18:29.847
Now, you are all here
because you've been doing

18:29.934 --> 18:31.806
things you shouldn't be doing!

18:35.505 --> 18:36.724
Mrs. Murphy,

18:36.811 --> 18:38.856
I hear you've been shorting
your weigh-ins.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.293
Not cool.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.383
And you two.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.516
Caught up
in dubious affairs, huh?

18:47.996 --> 18:51.869
Robert, I respect
everyone I work with,

18:51.956 --> 18:56.047
and all I ask for in return
is the same.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.572
When I do not receive it,
I worry about the message

18:58.659 --> 19:00.791
it sends out to others.

19:00.878 --> 19:04.404
Do you think it's fair to be
skimming for personal gain?

19:04.491 --> 19:06.057
Mm-mm.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.987
Susie, Susie, Susie.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.337
I don't know
how long you've been

19:24.424 --> 19:27.166
giving me inaccurate numbers,

19:27.253 --> 19:29.255
but I would hate
for your actions

19:29.342 --> 19:30.734
to influence others.

19:32.519 --> 19:35.217
So, like in Robert's case,
I have to send a message

19:35.304 --> 19:36.566
that's clear.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.622
Mrs. Murphy, I hope
there's no hard feelings.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.364
If it was up to me, I'd let you
off with a stern warning.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.061
Yeah.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.370
Oh, dammit!

19:57.457 --> 19:59.676
Apologies, everyone. I mean,
these things, they're just,

19:59.763 --> 20:01.983
they're-- they're old.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.420
You know,
if I recall correctly...

20:06.161 --> 20:09.556
the odds of
a second gun jamming,

20:09.643 --> 20:13.560
oh, they're about 1 in 125,000,

20:13.647 --> 20:16.040
but you know, I may be wrong--

20:33.797 --> 20:35.408
I'm gonna have to get
a new dry cleaner.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.064
Any word on this thief?

20:44.852 --> 20:46.070
Turns out...

20:47.681 --> 20:49.422
he's right under our nose.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.339
I took this
off our varmint here.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.082
"My partner for the money."

20:58.169 --> 21:00.171
"The abandoned town
of Lyncroft."

21:02.217 --> 21:03.218
It's a trap.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.269
But he cares about you.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.315
Doesn't he?

21:24.021 --> 21:25.545
Smile.

21:29.157 --> 21:32.073
You will make him
come here instead.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.814
Think he'll agree
to those terms?

21:35.032 --> 21:36.338
Make him.

21:37.165 --> 21:38.166
And then...

21:40.255 --> 21:43.084
take back my money
and kill them both.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.699
Can you do that?

21:49.786 --> 21:50.961
Or not?

21:58.839 --> 22:00.623
It's what you hired me for.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.370
It's important
we do this quick!

22:10.024 --> 22:14.507
Everyone must know that...
nobody can take from me.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.164
Bring me the thief!

22:29.260 --> 22:30.479
Oh, shit.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.139
Yeah, just.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.794
<i>Breathe.</i>

22:40.881 --> 22:44.014

24:34.298 --> 24:35.299
Shit.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.476
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry!

24:41.915 --> 24:43.482
I told you, I'm sorry!

24:43.569 --> 24:45.484
Get the hell out of here now!

25:04.938 --> 25:05.939
Come on!

25:08.071 --> 25:09.116
He went that way.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.738
<i>Find others

25:25.698 --> 25:27.264
- Drive!
- What, where?

25:27.351 --> 25:29.658
Anywhere, just drive,
put it in gear!

25:29.745 --> 25:31.660
Come on, just try putting it
in gear already!

25:31.747 --> 25:34.054
- Open the door!
- Come on!

25:49.417 --> 25:50.810
<i>And remember,</i>

25:50.897 --> 25:53.334

<i>because once present,</i>

25:55.249 --> 25:57.033

26:16.444 --> 26:17.663

26:19.752 --> 26:20.927
don't hurt me.

26:22.493 --> 26:23.756
It's not me
you gotta worry about.

26:26.497 --> 26:29.892
She had a badge,
I think she's a cop.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.590
Yeah, she's not
one of the good ones.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.119
Jellybeans, jellybeans.

26:41.687 --> 26:42.688
Jellybeans.

26:44.951 --> 26:45.952
Can you open the glove box?

26:47.518 --> 26:48.998
I wanna get my pills.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.439
Jellybeans. Jellybeans.

26:55.526 --> 26:59.095
No, no, no, not that one.
That's my breath freshener.

26:59.182 --> 27:02.708
Just... under the papers, yeah.

27:04.579 --> 27:05.928
They're for anxiety.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.108
You might want
to double up today.

27:15.546 --> 27:16.983
Pull over there.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.419
Sure, sure thing.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.079
This is where you get out.

27:26.166 --> 27:27.515
I'm sorry, what?

27:27.602 --> 27:29.560
Look, kid, the plan
is to rescue my partner,

27:29.648 --> 27:31.040
having a tag along isn't,

27:31.127 --> 27:33.521
so thank you for
the Sunday drive, now get out.

27:33.608 --> 27:36.959
I mean... I mean,
the truck's all I got, man.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.613
Hey, hey, hey, stop it.
Hey, what you doing?

27:38.700 --> 27:39.962
- What you doing?
- Now I am gonna hurt you.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.181
Get out!

27:41.268 --> 27:44.010
Hey! Come on, man, come on!

27:44.097 --> 27:45.664
Please don't do this,
I need this truck!

27:45.751 --> 27:47.013
Yeah, well the truck
is replaceable,

27:47.100 --> 27:48.492
- my partner isn't.
- Please--

27:49.972 --> 27:51.539
No, no, no, it's all...
it's all I got, man!

27:56.500 --> 27:57.676
Get in!

28:04.073 --> 28:05.422
Oh, shit!

28:05.509 --> 28:07.033
I got shot, dammit.
I'm bleeding!

28:07.120 --> 28:09.078
Shut up, kid,
it's only a flesh wound!

28:12.865 --> 28:14.257
- I don't want to die, man!
- You're not going

28:14.344 --> 28:15.824
to die today, kid.

28:15.911 --> 28:18.131
Keep your head down!

28:21.569 --> 28:23.092
Oh, my God,
we can't get through!

28:25.921 --> 28:27.314
- Get ready!
- For what?

28:27.401 --> 28:28.445
This.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.847
Shit!

28:47.900 --> 28:49.336
Hands up!

28:50.598 --> 28:52.078
Gotcha.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.524
Hey!

29:03.611 --> 29:06.222
Oh, the innocence of childhood!

29:06.962 --> 29:09.617
Hey, sweetheart!

29:12.141 --> 29:13.926
Remember me?

29:14.013 --> 29:15.579
That's for Tank.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.191
Easy, easy.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.336
<i>That's</i> the muscle you got us.

Besides, they're loyal!

29:50.049 --> 29:53.574
Now maybe the two of you
should do your jobs this time!

29:53.661 --> 29:55.184
And, uh...

29:56.664 --> 29:58.797
don't lose sight
of these guys, huh?

29:58.884 --> 30:00.407
Okay, bye.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.713

All right, here's the deal.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.425
Either you take us to the money.

30:18.512 --> 30:21.254
Or... we take you both
out into the desert.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.865
What? You can't do that.

30:23.952 --> 30:26.259
Oh, no, no, no,
that's illegal, you're cops!

30:26.346 --> 30:27.434
Honey.

30:28.739 --> 30:29.828
Your partner's cute.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.307
- I ain't his partner!
- Okay, good,

30:32.395 --> 30:33.832
so you're expendable then.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.270
So which is it?

30:39.054 --> 30:42.536
Out to the middle
of nowhere to do some very,

30:43.189 --> 30:44.755
very bad things.

30:46.366 --> 30:47.628
Or to the money?

30:48.759 --> 30:50.065
The choice is yours.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.859
Take the next right out of town.

31:02.382 --> 31:04.384
It's a bit of a drive.

31:04.471 --> 31:05.907
I hope you packed
some doughnuts.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.145
Stop.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.016
I said stop, Krispy Kreme.

31:29.496 --> 31:30.714
I heard you.

31:30.801 --> 31:31.977
I heard you the first time.

31:33.587 --> 31:34.893
There's nothing here.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.372
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.250
Stay as close to me as you can,

31:44.337 --> 31:45.991
- just stay as close to me--
- Are they gonna kill me?

31:46.078 --> 31:47.731
Shut up and stay
as close to me as you can.

32:04.531 --> 32:05.532
Listen up.

32:06.968 --> 32:10.667
If you let this one here
try anything, he will.

32:10.754 --> 32:14.323
If he does try something,
you can shoot him from here

32:15.107 --> 32:16.760
to here.

32:16.847 --> 32:18.545
But not until we've confirmed
that we have the money.

32:19.328 --> 32:20.416
This one?

32:20.503 --> 32:22.331
Yeah, we don't care.

32:22.418 --> 32:23.724
- Question.
- Hmm?

32:25.334 --> 32:27.510
Why don't we just
waste the kid right now?

32:27.597 --> 32:29.860
You search around here,
you're gonna find the money.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.994
But if you want the combination
to get into the safe,

32:33.081 --> 32:34.953
you don't touch
a hair on his body.

32:36.258 --> 32:38.260
We'll play nice, for now.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.785
Let's go.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.434
Hey, what's gonna happen?

33:21.521 --> 33:22.739
How do we know
he won't just kill us anyway

33:22.826 --> 33:23.914
if we give him the money?

33:25.307 --> 33:26.787
Do you got
some kind of plan or something?

33:26.874 --> 33:28.180
Shut up
and keep your head forward.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.095
- You see that building up ahead?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.705
Be the first one in--

33:31.792 --> 33:33.098
Hey!

33:34.316 --> 33:36.884
Quit your chit-chatting!
Let's go!

33:40.322 --> 33:41.280
Move!

33:51.986 --> 33:52.987
Stop.

33:55.511 --> 33:57.905
Dino, Justin.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.863
Make sure there's nothing
funny going on in there.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.707
Don't let them get away,
you idiots!

34:21.059 --> 34:24.192
Break down that door
and get me my money.

34:24.279 --> 34:25.237
What are they doing,
what are they doing?

34:25.324 --> 34:26.368
Don't worry, they can't get in.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.373
I think.

34:31.460 --> 34:34.028
Get in there. You, find
another way around, now!

34:34.594 --> 34:35.595
Turn around.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.423
Back to me!

34:37.510 --> 34:39.816
Come on, closer.

34:39.903 --> 34:42.036
Okay, man, where the hell'd
you get all this stuff, anyway?

34:42.123 --> 34:43.820
It came with my last score.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.953
Well, I bought the bolt cutters.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.650
So it's true?

34:47.737 --> 34:48.956
You stole a bunch of money?

34:49.043 --> 34:50.392
It's a bit
more complicated than that.

34:51.785 --> 34:53.395
Come on, hurry up!

34:53.482 --> 34:55.223
Come on!

34:55.310 --> 34:56.311
I'm guessing
your partner's in trouble

34:56.398 --> 34:57.660
because of the money
you stole, huh?

34:57.747 --> 34:59.445
You've got a knack
for asking horrible questions

34:59.532 --> 35:00.663
at all the wrong times, kid.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.969
Have you ever had a good time?

35:03.362 --> 35:05.407
Hey, focus, come on!

35:05.494 --> 35:06.452
I got it!

35:07.844 --> 35:10.934
Jellybeans, jellybeans...

35:11.021 --> 35:12.719
Oh, God, you're not
instilling confidence

35:12.806 --> 35:14.199
with me, kid, hurry up!

35:14.286 --> 35:15.504
I'm... I'm sorry!

35:24.165 --> 35:25.166
Here.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.562
Move.

35:40.399 --> 35:41.704
Let's have some fun.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.232
Huh.

35:48.494 --> 35:49.451
After him!

35:53.151 --> 35:54.152
Get over here!

35:55.414 --> 35:57.329
Move your ass!

35:57.416 --> 35:59.026
Oh, hell no.
What was that, man?

35:59.113 --> 36:00.114
What the hell was that?

36:00.201 --> 36:01.376
Part of the plan!

36:02.377 --> 36:03.509
You planned all of this?

36:03.596 --> 36:04.640
Technically for another party.

36:04.727 --> 36:05.989
Come on, kid!

36:11.517 --> 36:13.519
They're not in here!

36:13.606 --> 36:15.477
Go, hurry!

36:15.564 --> 36:17.349
Heads up, kid!

36:27.315 --> 36:28.577
Head to the yellow shack, kid!

36:36.716 --> 36:39.545
Yellow shack,
yellow shack, yellow shack.

36:39.632 --> 36:40.676
Yellow shack!

36:51.121 --> 36:52.514
They smoked Dino!

36:55.038 --> 36:56.039
Go!

37:11.620 --> 37:12.882
Come on!

37:14.057 --> 37:15.058
Come on!

37:54.402 --> 37:55.534
Die!

38:28.262 --> 38:30.830
There ain't no hiding from Sly!

38:34.964 --> 38:37.140
Oh-hoh! Bad spawn point!

38:57.987 --> 38:59.946
- Jellybeans, jellybeans.
- Forgot that was there.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.339
Snap out of it, kid, come on!

39:08.433 --> 39:11.827
Jellybeans,
jellybeans, jellybeans!

39:12.654 --> 39:13.786
Jellybeans, jellybeans!

39:19.139 --> 39:20.445
- Jellybeans.
- Enough with the jellybeans,

39:20.532 --> 39:22.055
okay?-Okay.

39:23.665 --> 39:26.189
You saved my life,
I'm not gonna let you die.

39:27.408 --> 39:29.236
Yeah.

39:29.323 --> 39:30.455
You okay?

39:31.281 --> 39:32.326
Yeah.

39:33.501 --> 39:34.894
I'm okay.

39:35.764 --> 39:37.026
Okay.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.139
Ravi! Ravi.

40:03.226 --> 40:04.576
Did you get the money?

40:48.968 --> 40:51.797
Mm, thank God
you stashed all this right here.

40:54.103 --> 40:55.148
I've never been here before.

40:57.672 --> 40:58.804
Don't worry,
I don't think you drank

40:58.891 --> 41:00.109
some old trucker's piss.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.373
Fuel up quick.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.898
We bought ourselves some time,
but we gotta keep moving.

41:15.429 --> 41:16.691
You gonna eat that?

41:31.053 --> 41:34.143
You got any friends? Family?

41:34.230 --> 41:35.754
They're gonna go
after loved ones.

41:37.625 --> 41:40.541
Nah, they're all dead now.

41:40.628 --> 41:42.891
I mean, there's this barista
at this cafe that I like,

41:42.978 --> 41:44.023
but, uh...

41:45.111 --> 41:46.547
it hasn't always gone well.

41:48.854 --> 41:50.769
I think my panic attacks
have always, like, stopped me

41:50.856 --> 41:51.944
from doing, well...

41:53.249 --> 41:55.425
pretty much everything.

41:55.513 --> 42:00.256
I'm still like, I can't believe
we did all that stuff today.

42:00.343 --> 42:01.823
It's still kind of crazy to me,
you know?

42:03.303 --> 42:05.044
Well, that's the whole point
of living, kid.

42:06.001 --> 42:07.394
Doing things.

42:07.481 --> 42:10.832
Yeah, I'm certainly off
to a big start alongside you.

42:10.919 --> 42:12.660
Yeah, well, not if
you keep repeating "jellybeans"

42:12.747 --> 42:15.315
all the time.

42:15.402 --> 42:17.230
Hey, you know,
the jellybeans thing is just

42:17.317 --> 42:20.450
something I picked up
from my dad, you know.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.322
It helps with my panic attacks.

42:22.409 --> 42:23.497
Yeah.

42:25.499 --> 42:27.893
You know, when I was little,
my mom would always, like,

42:27.980 --> 42:30.417
baby me,
which never really helped.

42:30.504 --> 42:33.899
But my dad though,
he was this super strict,

42:33.986 --> 42:35.204
no-nonsense kind of guy,

42:35.291 --> 42:37.163
and... you'd think
that'd be terrible,

42:37.250 --> 42:38.730
but I don't know, it was just...

42:38.817 --> 42:40.427
there was this confidence to it.

42:41.776 --> 42:44.083
I remember my dad
telling me, like,

42:44.170 --> 42:46.346
problems in life
are like jellybeans.

42:46.433 --> 42:47.695
They're all small,

42:47.782 --> 42:49.784
so you can eat up a bunch
of them at the same time,

42:49.871 --> 42:51.656
and most of the time,
they don't always taste bad,

42:51.743 --> 42:54.441
so yeah,
but except for licorice,

42:54.528 --> 42:55.616
spit those ones out.

42:57.662 --> 42:58.793
I mean my...

43:00.316 --> 43:03.015
My dad died
when I was 12 years old.

43:03.102 --> 43:04.190
Everyone did.

43:05.757 --> 43:07.759
So now, whenever I feel
an attack coming on,

43:07.846 --> 43:08.803
I just...

43:10.239 --> 43:12.024
just think about that.

43:12.111 --> 43:14.069
I just think about jellybeans.

43:18.683 --> 43:19.945
Jellybeans.

43:21.816 --> 43:24.253
Well, I guess
I got jellybeans to thank

43:24.340 --> 43:26.342
for saving my life back there.

43:34.394 --> 43:36.048
You know, my dad was a cop.

43:37.049 --> 43:38.441
Yeah, he was an honest cop.

43:40.705 --> 43:43.229
Took the fall
for his corrupt precinct.

43:43.316 --> 43:45.623
When he got out of the joint,
he ignored his family,

43:46.885 --> 43:48.147
gambled all the time.

43:50.018 --> 43:53.021
It got so bad that I was living
in a women's shelter

43:53.108 --> 43:57.504
with my mom using food stamps.

43:57.591 --> 44:00.638
- Oh, wow, that's--
- In the end, uh,

44:01.987 --> 44:05.033
he died over
a two-bit card game.

44:06.948 --> 44:08.341
Somebody just gunned him down.

44:10.038 --> 44:11.170
I was a kid too.

44:13.433 --> 44:15.653
So I know what it's like
having to take care of yourself.

44:18.220 --> 44:20.745
Man, I'm...
I'm so sorry about your dad.

44:22.572 --> 44:23.748
Same.

44:25.358 --> 44:26.489
But it gets better.

44:27.142 --> 44:28.840
I promise.

44:28.927 --> 44:31.669
I mean, look at me,
I pull heists for a living.

44:31.756 --> 44:33.148
Yeah, I mean,

44:33.235 --> 44:34.846
you're like
a real-life Robin Hood.

44:34.933 --> 44:36.804
Yeah, no,
don't get ahead of yourself.

44:36.891 --> 44:39.720
I mean, I'm only giving
the money to myself.

44:39.807 --> 44:41.156
So how much did you get?

44:43.811 --> 44:45.639
Well, enough to retire
on a beach.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.424
And not die like my dad.

44:52.515 --> 44:56.911
But first, I gotta get
this cigar back to my partner.

44:56.998 --> 44:59.044
And I gotta figure out
what to do with you.

44:59.131 --> 45:01.394
Well, yeah, yeah, sure,
sure thing, I mean,

45:01.481 --> 45:03.309
what's next, what's next
for the Jellybean Boys?

45:05.746 --> 45:07.356
No.

45:07.443 --> 45:10.403
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just--
I was just trying to think

45:10.490 --> 45:11.491
of a name for us, you know,

45:11.578 --> 45:12.797
now that
we're basically partners.

45:12.884 --> 45:15.060
- Yeah.
- Outlaws, stuff.

45:15.147 --> 45:17.410
Well, we're not anything, okay?

45:17.497 --> 45:19.455
You gotta get out of the city,
'cause you're in danger

45:19.542 --> 45:20.543
as long as you're with me.

45:27.986 --> 45:28.987
Shit.

45:31.859 --> 45:32.991
<i>Howdy!</i>

45:33.078 --> 45:35.254
<i>You certainly like
to play hard to get.</i>

45:36.429 --> 45:37.647
Who is this?

45:37.735 --> 45:40.607
Not one for small talk,
I dig it, yeah.

45:40.694 --> 45:41.913
<i>Where's Vic?</i>

45:44.350 --> 45:46.352
Stay cool, young buck.

45:46.439 --> 45:48.310
My employer agrees to a trade,

45:48.397 --> 45:49.964
<i>nice and simple.</i>

45:50.051 --> 45:52.445
<i>You bring the money, we bring
your friend and let the sun set</i>

45:52.532 --> 45:53.576
on this whole damn thing.

45:53.663 --> 45:55.535
What do you say,
we got us a deal?

45:55.622 --> 45:57.232
<i>How do I know he's still alive?</i>

45:57.929 --> 45:58.930
Well,

45:59.017 --> 46:01.802
<i>now that is a fair question.</i>

46:01.889 --> 46:05.284
<i>Though, I'm a little saddened
that you don't trust me.</i>

46:05.371 --> 46:07.068
<i>Go on now.</i>

46:07.155 --> 46:08.243
Say hello.

46:11.464 --> 46:13.248
<i>Vic, is that you?</i>

46:13.335 --> 46:14.336
<i>Are you okay?</i>

46:14.989 --> 46:16.338
I'm okay, kid.

46:16.425 --> 46:18.601
<i>I'm okay.</i>

46:18.688 --> 46:20.778
<i>No worse than
when the Wolfington Sisters</i>

46:20.865 --> 46:22.780
- <i>had the jump on us--</i>
- Hey.

46:22.867 --> 46:25.608
He is indeed alive and well.
I will text the when and wheres

46:25.695 --> 46:27.741
and uh,
mosey on over fast, will you,

46:27.828 --> 46:28.873
my phone's almost dead.

46:29.308 --> 46:30.875
Deal.

46:30.962 --> 46:36.054
<i>Fair warning, hoss,
we will show up well prepared.</i>

46:36.141 --> 46:37.664
I suggest you save any tricks.

46:37.751 --> 46:40.319
Come with the money, make this
easy on everybody, you hear?

46:42.625 --> 46:43.670
What now?

46:51.983 --> 46:52.984
New plan.

46:58.598 --> 47:00.513
Oh, Lord Almighty.

47:02.776 --> 47:04.082
Hey, hey, here you go.

47:06.258 --> 47:07.433
Mmm.

47:11.393 --> 47:12.612
Whiskey.

47:14.309 --> 47:16.529
Little moments
of civility are needed,

47:16.616 --> 47:18.183
especially in our profession.

47:18.270 --> 47:19.619
Indeed.

47:19.706 --> 47:23.492
Mm. Mm-mm-mm. Oh.

47:23.579 --> 47:25.973
These sisters you mentioned,
I'm intrigued.

47:28.976 --> 47:30.978
Just a botch job
back in the day.

47:32.197 --> 47:34.852
Ended up with me, well,

47:34.939 --> 47:36.984
pretty much looking
like I do now.

47:40.901 --> 47:43.948
You gotta be careful with
the ladies in this business.

47:44.035 --> 47:45.297
They can be shrewd.

47:46.602 --> 47:48.604
Well, they didn't get us.

47:48.691 --> 47:50.171
And we got the money.

47:50.258 --> 47:51.303
We always do.

47:57.178 --> 47:58.788
Optimistic demeanor.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.051
There you go.

48:00.138 --> 48:02.053
Mm.

48:02.140 --> 48:05.883
- Oh.
- Oh, now.

48:09.843 --> 48:12.237
A real shame I have to kill you.

48:14.065 --> 48:15.893
You're not so bad yourself.

48:17.503 --> 48:19.722
For a psychopathic killer.

48:19.809 --> 48:22.943
No, no, no, could not be
further from the truth.

48:23.030 --> 48:25.163
I don't just kill anybody.

48:26.599 --> 48:28.296
And definitely never children.

48:29.950 --> 48:32.170
No, just people
who don't stop doing

48:32.257 --> 48:34.128
what they shouldn't be doing.

48:41.048 --> 48:43.181
Old friend of mine used to say,

48:44.312 --> 48:45.835
"Get fast, get gone."

48:47.011 --> 48:50.710
Means never linger on a job.

48:50.797 --> 48:54.801
Otherwise, you're begging
to get your ticket punched.

49:00.154 --> 49:02.940
You lingered too long
on this one, partner.

49:04.898 --> 49:07.466
Well, I can say the same
about you, buckaroo.

49:17.302 --> 49:18.564
Boss is here.

49:20.044 --> 49:21.349
So this Vic guy.

49:21.436 --> 49:23.525
He met your dad in prison?

49:23.612 --> 49:27.268
Yeah, single-handedly
kept him alive.

49:27.355 --> 49:28.487
He's not much with his fists,

49:28.574 --> 49:30.010
but he's pretty good
with his mouth.

49:36.147 --> 49:37.757
- Right, right...
- For talking, kid!

49:39.193 --> 49:40.934
He taught me everything I know.

49:41.021 --> 49:42.849
And he's pretty much
the only family that I got.

49:44.590 --> 49:45.634
So what's the plan?

49:45.721 --> 49:46.809
How are we gonna save Vic?

49:46.896 --> 49:47.897
I don't know.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.769
I'm pretty sure it's a trap.

49:49.856 --> 49:51.205
How can you be so sure
it's a trap?

49:51.292 --> 49:52.990
Well, it's what
the Wolfington Sisters would do.

49:53.077 --> 49:53.599
The who?

49:53.686 --> 49:55.209
Never mind.

49:55.296 --> 49:57.211
- Hey, maybe we could just--
- How many times have I told you

49:57.298 --> 49:59.431
there's no "we"?

49:59.518 --> 50:01.911
Come on, man,
I could help out, I mean,

50:01.999 --> 50:03.783
you saw what I can do
when I'm with you.

50:03.870 --> 50:05.654
Yeah, I saw an innocent kid

50:05.741 --> 50:07.569
almost commit mass murder.

50:07.656 --> 50:09.702
Trust me, you don't want that
on your conscience.

50:09.789 --> 50:11.225
And neither do I.

50:11.312 --> 50:12.357
Come on.

50:16.839 --> 50:20.104
Hey, who the heck
did you rip off, the Army?

50:20.191 --> 50:21.279
Hold this.

50:24.369 --> 50:25.979
Ho, is that...

50:26.893 --> 50:28.025
That's a lot of money.

50:28.112 --> 50:30.462
It's gonna be a lot
to give up, you know?

50:30.549 --> 50:31.985
Who said I'm gonna give it up?

50:32.072 --> 50:34.031
Wait, to save Vic's life,
I mean,

50:34.118 --> 50:35.249
you gotta give up
the money, right?

50:35.336 --> 50:37.164
Well, not if I don't have to.

50:37.251 --> 50:39.210
Oh, come on, man,
just give them the money.

50:40.211 --> 50:42.082
It's not that easy, kid.

50:42.169 --> 50:44.215
You gambling with his life!

50:44.302 --> 50:45.912
You really need
the money that bad?

50:45.999 --> 50:48.262
No. I don't need it.

50:48.349 --> 50:50.482
I want it.

50:50.569 --> 50:52.353
I'll figure the plan out.

50:59.056 --> 51:01.362
- What's this?
- Take it.

51:01.449 --> 51:03.756
It's a thank you for hitting me
with your ice cream truck

51:03.843 --> 51:05.497
and saving my life.

51:05.584 --> 51:07.281
This one too.

51:07.368 --> 51:08.848
- But I--
- No buts!

51:08.935 --> 51:10.806
I've been down this road before.
You're not coming with me.

51:18.858 --> 51:20.120
It's go time.

51:21.165 --> 51:22.427
Let's get the hell out of here.

51:30.826 --> 51:32.132
Follow me.

51:33.177 --> 51:35.048
Throw the plank
on the side of the road.

51:51.064 --> 51:52.326
So this is it?

51:53.719 --> 51:55.112
I'm afraid so, kid.

52:03.294 --> 52:04.425
Hey!

52:12.085 --> 52:13.565
Since I won't be around
to talk sense

52:13.652 --> 52:14.696
into you no more.

52:20.093 --> 52:22.051
You know you're lucky
to even have family?

52:27.100 --> 52:28.449
Yeah.

52:32.497 --> 52:34.629
Lay low for a while, kid.

52:38.938 --> 52:40.200
And cheer up.

52:41.332 --> 52:42.985
'Cause your dad was right.

52:47.816 --> 52:49.862
It is all jellybeans.

52:54.649 --> 52:55.781
Don't follow me.

53:25.724 --> 53:27.421
We got a matching description
on a suspect

53:27.508 --> 53:30.163
from the 2-4-1
earlier today, over.

53:30.250 --> 53:31.686
<i>Copy, proceed with caution.</i>

53:51.358 --> 53:56.102
After the money is confirmed,
shoot the old man.

53:56.189 --> 53:58.800
Then I will take my time
gutting this thief up

53:58.887 --> 54:00.237
piece by piece.

54:22.302 --> 54:28.439
<i>♪ As I walked out on
the streets of Laredo ♪</i>

54:28.526 --> 54:33.922
<i>♪ As I walked out
on Laredo one day ♪</i>

54:35.402 --> 54:38.405
<i>♪ I spied a young cowboy ♪</i>

54:38.492 --> 54:42.496
<i>♪ All wrapped in white linen ♪</i>

54:42.583 --> 54:48.110
<i>♪ All wrapped in white linen
as cold as the grave ♪</i>

55:44.950 --> 55:46.125
All this for me?

55:47.561 --> 55:49.171
I'm flattered.

55:49.258 --> 55:52.523
Well, I hear
you can be a Slippery Sally.

55:52.610 --> 55:54.176
Plus I don't like
the desert at night,

55:54.263 --> 55:55.656
it's spooky and cold.

55:57.266 --> 55:58.920
So let's keep it simple.

55:59.007 --> 56:00.226
Show us the money.

56:01.270 --> 56:02.446
Release Vic first.

56:02.533 --> 56:05.100
You're not in the position
to call the shots!

56:05.884 --> 56:07.059
Right.

56:30.082 --> 56:31.300
You satisfied?

56:45.314 --> 56:47.752
It's a bit overkill,
don't you think?

56:47.839 --> 56:49.318
Oh, those aren't ours.

57:00.895 --> 57:02.549
KPD!

57:02.636 --> 57:07.511
Everybody, drop your weapons,
hands up!

57:07.598 --> 57:08.686
Rat!

57:08.773 --> 57:10.122
Don't make me say it twice,

57:10.209 --> 57:12.037
drop your weapons, hands up!

57:12.124 --> 57:13.560
That includes you!

57:30.882 --> 57:33.014
Welcome to the show, gentlemen.

57:33.798 --> 57:37.323
Kid, and uh, lady.

57:38.759 --> 57:40.413
Can I ask
what we can do you for?

57:40.500 --> 57:43.068
We're here to seize the stolen
money in those duffle bags.

57:43.155 --> 57:46.332
Disarm immediately
and cooperate.

57:48.116 --> 57:51.293
The aforementioned stolen goods

57:51.380 --> 57:53.382
actually belong
to my employer here.

57:56.342 --> 57:58.562
Now we appreciate
your effort and your service,

57:58.649 --> 58:00.825
but we got it from here.

58:00.912 --> 58:03.044
Give us the money!

58:24.544 --> 58:25.632
Look.

58:27.852 --> 58:29.941
I don't give a shit
about the cash.

58:30.724 --> 58:31.812
Just my partner.

58:33.335 --> 58:34.989
And maybe now this stray.

58:36.904 --> 58:40.517
So why don't I just
leave the cash here,

58:42.083 --> 58:43.737
and the two of you...

58:46.871 --> 58:49.090
all sort it amongst yourselves.

58:57.534 --> 58:58.839
Deal?

58:58.926 --> 59:00.798
I'm not sharing my money!

59:00.885 --> 59:01.929
With anyone!

59:03.409 --> 59:04.758
Okay.

59:17.423 --> 59:18.903
Go get the bag!

59:18.990 --> 59:20.513
Go on, get it!

59:40.011 --> 59:42.361
I'd be careful,
there might be C-4 in those.

59:49.107 --> 59:50.369
Release them!

59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.684
The money stays, we go.

01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:05.471
Otherwise, the whole place
is gonna go up like a bonfire.

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:09.214
Well, we got quite
the conundrum here, huh, hombre?

01:00:09.301 --> 01:00:10.607
It's bullshit.

01:00:13.044 --> 01:00:14.045
Yeah,

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:15.350
he's full of shit.

01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:19.833
Jellybeans,
jellybeans, jellybeans,

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.968
jellybeans, jellybeans,
jellybeans, jellybeans.

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:26.884
Jellybeans,
jellybeans, jellybeans,

01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:30.017
jellybeans, jellybeans,
jellybeans, jellybeans...

01:00:32.933 --> 01:00:35.196
Everybody listen to me!

01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:37.634
One press of this button...

01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:42.551
Just one push,
and we all go up together!

01:00:43.988 --> 01:00:45.859
I ain't playing around,
I'm gonna do it!

01:00:49.558 --> 01:00:51.735
The kid's clearly cracked.

01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:55.173
Release him now.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.349
Money stays, we go.

01:01:03.529 --> 01:01:05.139
All right, <i>hermano.</i>

01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:09.840
You're free to walk.

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.426
Hey, kid, you good?

01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:33.037
Wolfington Sisters, huh?
Great story.

01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:34.560
Except this time, no money.

01:01:34.647 --> 01:01:36.954
- Maybe.
- Kid, what?

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:38.433
Come on!

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:43.482
Great improvising, kid.

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:44.701
You gave up the money!

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:46.615
Don't get all cute
and cuddly with me.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:47.791
You drive that thing?

01:01:47.878 --> 01:01:50.141
- I don't like this plan.
- What plan?

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.407
Get fast, get gone.

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.322
Yes!

01:01:57.409 --> 01:01:58.671
Come on, kid, let's go!

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.551
Okay, here we go, boys!

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.362
There's no C-4!

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.314
Bring my chopper.

01:03:23.538 --> 01:03:24.583
Nushi!

01:03:33.635 --> 01:03:34.854
Please!

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:40.947
Please, they gave me no choice!

01:03:41.034 --> 01:03:43.384
Your death would be
a dishonor on my time.

01:03:44.516 --> 01:03:46.344
After everything
I've done for you?

01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:05.145
We gotta go, we gotta go!

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:09.497
We're not leaving
without my money!

01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:10.803
- We gotta go!
- No bailing!

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.718
We're going, okay?

01:04:22.728 --> 01:04:24.121
Wait!

01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:26.645
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:28.255
Hey, I just want to say,

01:04:28.342 --> 01:04:30.040
I'm a really big fan
of your work.

01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:31.389
What do you say
we get out of here?

01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:33.347
I drive, you shoot?

01:04:33.434 --> 01:04:34.958
Yipee ki-yay, motherfucker.

01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:36.611
Yes!

01:04:57.154 --> 01:04:58.546
Son of a bitch.

01:04:59.373 --> 01:05:00.809
You good, kid?

01:05:04.465 --> 01:05:06.337
Never better!

I just realized I don't even
know his name, I don't know...

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.600
- What's his name?
- Duck!

01:07:19.687 --> 01:07:21.515
Duck?-Duck!

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:25.998
Shit!

01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:27.130
If you have a gun,

01:07:27.217 --> 01:07:29.001
right about now
would be real helpful!

01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:44.060
Your side is clear, kid.

01:07:46.192 --> 01:07:47.280
Okay.

01:07:49.587 --> 01:07:52.155
Oh, shit, holy shit.

01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:53.634
Check under your seat!

01:07:53.721 --> 01:07:54.766
Okay.

01:07:57.943 --> 01:07:58.944
Now we're talking!

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:31.977
He is a persistent cuss.

01:08:54.042 --> 01:08:56.393
I'm about to die.

01:09:15.325 --> 01:09:16.978
Oh, shit.

01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:38.304
Hold on, kid!

01:09:38.391 --> 01:09:39.784
I've never done this before.

01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:13.861
I got you.
I got you, kid. I got you.

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:24.829
You're gonna be all right,
kid, you're gonna be all right.

01:11:31.678 --> 01:11:32.810
Don't.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:38.642
Don't what?

01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:05.059
Damn shame.

01:12:28.213 --> 01:12:29.606
Yeehaw.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:41.966
It's all right,
it's all right.

01:12:42.053 --> 01:12:43.620
It's all right.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.817
Vic!

01:13:50.904 --> 01:13:53.037
No, Vic!

01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:54.255
- It's going to be okay.
- Vic!

01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:55.431
It's going to be okay.

01:13:56.649 --> 01:13:58.825
Hey... hey, kid.

01:13:58.912 --> 01:14:00.348
Stay with me, man.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.524
Stay with me.

01:14:05.353 --> 01:14:06.616
Hey.

01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:09.749
Hey, kid.

01:14:09.836 --> 01:14:13.884
Hey, hey, tell me
one of your stories.

01:14:13.971 --> 01:14:15.581
It's gonna be okay.

01:14:15.668 --> 01:14:17.148
It's gonna be okay.

01:14:17.235 --> 01:14:19.280
Tell me one of your stories.

01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:20.891
Stay with me.

01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:48.484
It's a great story.

01:14:52.096 --> 01:14:53.532
Great story.

01:14:56.883 --> 01:14:58.624
You'll be all right, kid.

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:04.369
You're gonna be okay now.

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:55.986
Hey.

01:16:00.468 --> 01:16:01.687
Stay with him.

01:17:55.932 --> 01:17:57.803
You think you're better than me?

01:18:39.453 --> 01:18:40.628
You okay?

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:48.419
You were right, kid.

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.813
I was lucky.

01:18:55.121 --> 01:18:56.383
Come on.

01:20:32.349 --> 01:20:33.741
Son of a bitch.

01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:41.184
You had me going there
for a second, kid.

01:20:41.271 --> 01:20:44.274
I thought you might be
the owner of this plane.

01:20:44.361 --> 01:20:45.841
Still up to
your old tricks, huh?

01:20:47.016 --> 01:20:49.279
Well, once an outlaw,
always an outlaw.

01:20:49.366 --> 01:20:51.847
I guess this...

01:20:51.934 --> 01:20:53.892
this should be
a fitting goodbye.

01:20:56.677 --> 01:20:58.027
What's this?

01:20:58.114 --> 01:20:59.942
Oh, it's just uh, I don't know,

01:21:00.029 --> 01:21:02.161
just... just thought
it didn't feel right

01:21:02.248 --> 01:21:04.555
not splitting the money
you gave me with you.

01:21:07.297 --> 01:21:09.821
Take it, honestly,
I want you to have it.

01:21:09.908 --> 01:21:14.391
You've... done so much for me,
like, you've honestly given me

01:21:14.478 --> 01:21:17.263
way more than I need
to start over, you know?

01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:21.006
I mean, I even got myself
a date with the barista tonight.

01:21:25.054 --> 01:21:26.229
Look at you, kid.

01:21:27.447 --> 01:21:28.709
Doing things.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.235
Yeah, I am.

01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:35.629
I'm proud of you.

01:21:40.504 --> 01:21:41.548
Thanks.

01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:44.725
No.

01:21:46.945 --> 01:21:48.164
Thank you, partner.

01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:55.649
Jellybeans.

01:21:57.564 --> 01:21:58.826
Jellybeans.

01:22:04.484 --> 01:22:05.616
You can let go of my hand now.

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:08.314
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

01:22:09.533 --> 01:22:10.577
It's okay.

01:22:32.382 --> 01:22:33.426
Hey, kid.

01:22:39.345 --> 01:22:41.260
Since I won't be around
to talk any sense into you.

01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:52.141
You okay?

01:22:56.188 --> 01:22:57.407
Never better.
