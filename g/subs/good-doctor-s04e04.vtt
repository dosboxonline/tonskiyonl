[yoga instructor] <i>Move from Bhujangasana</i>
<i>into Adho Mukha Svanasana.</i>

00:10.969 --> 00:11.970
<i>And hold that.</i>

00:12.679 --> 00:14.389
-[Lea] Do you like this?
-Mm…

00:15.640 --> 00:16.766
I'm not sure.

00:17.642 --> 00:19.144
I like that you like it.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.689
-[alarm chimes]
-Time for work!

00:23.440 --> 00:24.441
[sighs]

00:25.358 --> 00:27.777
-Guess we'll finish Vinyasa flow…
-[recording turns off]

00:27.861 --> 00:28.987
next time I come over.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.697
You shouldn't come over anymore.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.783
You should move in.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.705
Things are different now.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.124
You lived here before. What's different?

00:41.499 --> 00:43.710
Everything is different.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.337
Then, we were roomies, pals, buddies,

00:46.421 --> 00:48.298
and now we're… a real thing.

00:48.381 --> 00:52.427
A better thing, for sure,
but also more complicated.

00:52.510 --> 00:56.681
We're the same people
in the same place doing the same things.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.683
It's bigger than that, Shaun.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.061
I hope it is. I…

01:01.436 --> 01:05.482
Living together means
more commitment, more trust.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.943
And I don't think we're quite there yet.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.821
You don't trust me?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.615
No, I do. It's just…

01:14.741 --> 01:17.160
I need a bit more.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.047
[whispering] Copernicus1543.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.511
It's my banking password.

[explosions]

01:47.941 --> 01:49.275
-[both scream]
-Yes! I got you!

01:49.359 --> 01:50.485
-No!
-Bow to your queen.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.861
-No, bitch! No!
-Yes!

01:51.945 --> 01:52.946
[both laugh]

01:55.740 --> 01:59.285
Argh! Where did you find
the 10,000 hours that you put into that?

01:59.994 --> 02:01.913
-Phew!
-I like filling my evenings

02:01.996 --> 02:04.082
-with numbing mindlessness.
-Mm.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.375
-[cellphone chimes]
-Oh.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.252
Ugh!

02:07.335 --> 02:10.213
Morgan needs me to go in ASAP. [typing]

02:10.296 --> 02:11.881
You figure she shouldn't page you?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.675
She can handle it on her own

02:13.758 --> 02:15.677
because she used to be
a surgical resident?

02:15.760 --> 02:16.845
Be the bigger person.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.847
It's an ingrown hair.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.307
Mm.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.728
Definitely an ingrown hair.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.357
Unfortunately, the ingrown hair
caused an abscess that needs to be lanced.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.525
By a surgeon.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.112
Please give this man the VIP treatment.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.322
I have another case to attend to,
but don't worry.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.490
I'll be checking in.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.122
Such a nice lady.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.123
[chuckles softly]

02:45.540 --> 02:47.750
So, how shall we proceed?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.379
I'm going with
"drain the abscess and dress the wound."

02:52.046 --> 02:52.881
Set it up.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.134
Maybe we should do a biopsy?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.888
Well, it could be a cutaneous pili migrans

02:59.971 --> 03:01.681
or have a deep sinus tract

03:01.764 --> 03:04.392
or a creeping eruption
caused by a parasitic disease.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.605
Give him the VIP treatment.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.358
Abdominal pain can be scary
when you're pregnant.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.528
But I wouldn't worry.
You have two rambunctious boys.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.031
I know. It's like a cage match in here.
[chuckles]

03:18.114 --> 03:19.532
Where's your first-year resident?

03:19.616 --> 03:22.452
I have two first-year residents,
but I don't want to teach them.

03:22.535 --> 03:23.745
They're very distracting.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.039
You have a dizygotic, dichorionic,

03:26.122 --> 03:27.916
diamniotic pregnancy.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.709
It just means your twins are fraternal

03:29.792 --> 03:31.586
and in separate amniotic sacs.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.713
First-years aren't distractions.
They're godsends.

03:33.796 --> 03:34.881
She has edema.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.467
Not surprising for someone
who's 26 weeks pregnant.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.219
They'll do anything you want.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.554
Scut work, follow-ups, coffee runs…

03:41.638 --> 03:43.640
-I don't like coffee.
-…laundry, apple runs.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.891
I already did that.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.268
[machine beeping, humming]

03:47.352 --> 03:49.229
-What was her BP?
-Normal.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.147
-[machine beeps]
-BP's no longer normal.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.440
She's hypertensive.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.734
What does that mean, Dr. Murray?

03:57.403 --> 03:58.571
Is your vision blurred?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.281
A bit. I'm tired.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.909
Sounds like preeclampsia.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.286
If we don't get your BP down ASAP,

04:05.370 --> 04:06.996
you could lose your pregnancy.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.333
[theme music playing]

04:18.800 --> 04:21.135
We need to start you
on anti-hypertensive meds,

04:21.219 --> 04:23.471
but your edema makes it
difficult to place an IV,

04:23.554 --> 04:25.473
so we need to run a central line.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.725
[apple crunches]

04:28.935 --> 04:30.019
[muffled] Dr. Jackson?

04:30.895 --> 04:32.313
[monitor beeping steadily]

04:37.902 --> 04:38.903
[winces]

04:48.329 --> 04:50.248
Mind if I give a hand, Dr. Murphy?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.125
Hmm.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.679
Is there anyone you want us to call?

05:04.762 --> 05:08.516
Uh, my boyfriend decided
his obligations ended

05:08.599 --> 05:10.393
at offering to pay for an abortion.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.522
Soft man in a hard world.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.649
-[chuckles lightly]
-[rapid beeping]

05:17.108 --> 05:18.526
Fetal heart rate's dropping.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.112
But only one of them.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.617
Did you have another birth?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.953
-No.
-Any pregnancy?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.997
Miscarriage, abortion, stillbirth?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.125
I had an abortion when I was 15.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.002
It's not preeclampsia.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.504
One fetus is Rh-positive,

05:38.588 --> 05:40.214
and the mother is Rh-negative,

05:40.298 --> 05:42.258
and her body is perceiving him as a threat

05:42.341 --> 05:44.135
and attacking him with antibodies.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.970
Antibodies she could only have

05:46.054 --> 05:48.097
if she had an earlier pregnancy.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.517
My body is trying to kill
one of my babies?

05:52.518 --> 05:53.519
Yes.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.611
Waiting on Billy's biopsy results?

06:02.278 --> 06:03.696
To confirm an ingrown hair?

06:06.741 --> 06:08.493
You grew up in a Hasidic family, right?

06:11.287 --> 06:13.039
How are they handling
you being a doctor?

06:13.122 --> 06:14.373
[inhales deeply]

06:14.457 --> 06:16.626
I haven't spoken to them in

06:17.877 --> 06:19.796
four years, except one sister.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.844
I chose not to live by their rules. I…

06:27.553 --> 06:29.013
I knew the consequences.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.808
My dad was a real estate agent,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.435
obsessed with two
completely unrelated things,

06:34.519 --> 06:35.728
teeth and taxes.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.189
Thought I'd spend
the rest of my life selling condos.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.774
Now I'm a surfin' surgeon,

06:39.857 --> 06:41.442
but I still floss three times a day

06:41.526 --> 06:43.903
and pay my installments four times a year.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.613
So, what's my dental floss?

06:46.823 --> 06:47.782
Fire and brimstone.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.662
Mm. Actually, that is
from the New Testament.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.457
I don't even know what brimstone is.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.086
I meant you fear disaster.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.132
Your people's history
is kind of filled with it.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.718
Billy has cancer.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.812
How are your first-years doing?

07:18.688 --> 07:20.356
Jordan talks too much,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.191
and Olivia talks too little.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.903
And Olivia does not know
where the jugular vein is.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.114
You see her resume?

07:28.614 --> 07:32.034
Her grades and USMLE scores
were nearly perfect.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.870
So, if it's not a lack of knowledge,

07:33.953 --> 07:35.163
what do you think it is?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.333
I think Olivia has the potential
to be an exemplary doctor

07:39.417 --> 07:41.752
if you push her,
give her a little extra attention.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.298
Isn't that unfair to Jordan?

07:45.381 --> 07:48.259
Was it unfair to the applicant
who didn't get your position

07:48.342 --> 07:52.180
because Dr. Glassman thought
that you needed some extra attention?

07:53.848 --> 07:56.934
Olivia just doesn't like
being in the spotlight. That's all.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.397
Olivia's resume didn't say anything
about not liking the spotlight.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.398
Exactly.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.025
Don't trust resumes.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.155
[Shaun] <i>Locate jugular vein.</i>

08:12.533 --> 08:13.618
Insert needle.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.620
Get a venous blush.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.498
Remove syringe, leaving needle in,

08:18.581 --> 08:21.042
-then thread…
-Thread wire into needle.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.378
Remove needle.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.882
Scalpel to skin,

08:27.965 --> 08:32.762
while being aware of a persistent
left-sided superior vena cava placement,

08:32.845 --> 08:35.932
present in 4% of those
with congenital heart disease.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.809
Remove wire.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.937
Suture in line to skin.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.480
And done.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.861
I guess you were nervous before.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.988
Didn't you have first-case jitters?

08:51.489 --> 08:52.406
No.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.825
[pager chimes]

08:57.036 --> 08:59.247
The sick twin has gone
into severe distress.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.966
You have amelanotic melanoma.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.300
Skin cancer.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.346
But there's good news.
We should be able to remove all of it.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.682
We can do it today.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.350
Sorry. Car trouble.

09:20.351 --> 09:23.729
Hi, Dr. Park.
Just telling Billy about his cancer.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.149
I got a great mechanic for you.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.360
If you tell her Billy sent you,

09:29.443 --> 09:31.320
she'll give you a friends-and-family.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.739
[chuckles] Okay. Thanks for that.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.284
You have an amazing attitude.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.995
You know, my wife
used to tease me about that.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.206
She died three years ago.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.333
I'm sorry.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.418
[sighs]

09:46.210 --> 09:49.046
You know, on our second date,
I got a flat.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.882
Now, I think she thought
I was gonna curse,

09:51.966 --> 09:53.551
[chuckles] but all I could say was,

09:53.634 --> 09:57.138
"Good timing.
Costco's got a sale on tires."

09:57.221 --> 09:58.389
[chuckles]

09:58.764 --> 10:02.893
[sniffs] It's Addy's Auto,
`Los Gatos and Gateway.

10:06.897 --> 10:07.898
[sighs]

10:08.774 --> 10:10.276
[monitor beeping, ultrasound pulsing]

10:10.359 --> 10:12.153
We are through the uterine wall.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.739
Dr. Jackson, what's our next step?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.950
Advance through the trocar

10:18.034 --> 10:19.619
15 millimeters beyond the tip

10:19.702 --> 10:21.829
until the opening of the distal basket

10:21.912 --> 10:23.706
can be confirmed by ultrasound.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.711
Exactly.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.964
What would you like me
to advance, Dr. Jackson?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.592
Oh. Yes. Right.

10:34.675 --> 10:38.429
[Olivia] Obviously, you would be advancing
the double basket rocket catheter

10:38.512 --> 10:39.513
not this.

10:39.972 --> 10:40.890
Sorry.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.225
Not your fault.

10:43.809 --> 10:47.313
If a junior resident is ill-prepared,
that's on the senior resident.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.905
How is it fair that I get blamed
for a first-year's mistake,

10:55.988 --> 10:59.325
and how can I help that person
without being unfair to the other one?

10:59.408 --> 11:02.453
And how fair was the preferential
treatment that you gave me?

11:02.536 --> 11:05.247
And how fair was it
to the other first-year resident,

11:05.331 --> 11:07.500
who didn't get placed
because you helped me?

11:07.583 --> 11:10.044
-And how fair was…
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.128
Put the list down.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.632
Only four questions at a time.
That's my limit.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.550
What kind of mistake?

11:18.094 --> 11:20.763
Even though I went over the procedure
with Olivia,

11:20.846 --> 11:23.933
she still gave Dr. Andrews the pusher rod

11:24.016 --> 11:27.186
when he needed the rocket catheter,
and he said it was my fault.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.437
It was your fault.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.315
You got to help her a little more.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.734
That is not fair to Jordan.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.444
What does fairness have to do with it?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.071
It's not about equality.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.573
It's about figuring out
what each person needs

11:39.657 --> 11:41.784
and then teaching them how to get it.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.911
How do I know what they need?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.456
[sighs] Well, you've taught them medicine,
right?

11:47.957 --> 11:50.543
So, uh, maybe it's something else.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.877
Maybe it's an emotional issue.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.547
Well, then I definitely
can't give them what they need.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.090
You can ask them.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.008
About their emotions?

11:58.092 --> 12:00.302
Yeah, ask them how they feel.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.888
I don't care how they feel.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.266
That's the beauty of it.
You don't have to care.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.560
You just have to ask them
how they really feel.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.019
Then they start talking.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.021
[laughs] And some people love to talk.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.109
[door closes]

12:15.985 --> 12:17.069
[sighs]

12:18.696 --> 12:20.114
[monitor beeping]

12:24.243 --> 12:25.619
[Claire] Oh. [scoffs] Mm.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.912
Have you been working out?

12:27.663 --> 12:29.290
[Dr. Park] I could only find mediums.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.291
[laughs]

12:31.375 --> 12:33.836
You know how many sets
of large scrubs I had to hide?

12:33.919 --> 12:34.753
<i>Thirty-one.</i>

12:39.550 --> 12:40.801
[Dr. Park] Injecting dye.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.599
[wheezing]

12:46.682 --> 12:48.100
[rapid beeping]

12:48.184 --> 12:49.977
BP's dropping. Diffuse skin flushing.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.145
He's in anaphylactic shock.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.314
-He's allergic to the dye.
-Ten cc epinephrine.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.902
BP barely measurable.
We should intubate. Initiate CPR.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.697
<i>You should cannulate his femoral vein</i>
<i>to give pressers and volume.</i>

13:02.406 --> 13:03.824
Let's intubate and cannulate.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.789
His jugular's distended.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.375
Maybe he has cardiac tamponade
from a pericardial effusion.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.877
He might need open-heart surgery.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.755
[Enrique] Worst-case scenario
worked out for you the first time.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.381
Think lightning's
gonna strike twice?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.885
Maybe not, but I'm still not gonna
stand on a hill in a thunderstorm.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.930
Let's call Lim.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.890
Prep the patient for a pericardiotomy.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.476
Two for two.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.152
[sitar music playing on speakers]

13:42.696 --> 13:44.490
Okay, you can't do yoga at work.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.450
I do it at home. What's the difference?

13:47.618 --> 13:50.871
Work behavior is
not the same as home behavior.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.458
Ooh. So you're saying context matters.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.626
Of course.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.837
Same way that
two roommates living together

13:58.921 --> 14:01.423
is different
from a couple living together.

14:02.299 --> 14:06.053
Same people, same place,
different context.

14:09.265 --> 14:13.227
Once our feelings change,
everything changes.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.525
I still feel the same way
when I'm with you.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.777
Happy.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.707
Kenzie's BP and edema have improved.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.502
The fetus's echo
shows improved heart function.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.462
Catheter's working.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.966
How do you feel?

14:45.467 --> 14:46.302
Okay.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.265
How do you really feel?

14:53.893 --> 14:54.894
Um…

14:55.477 --> 14:56.687
Really okay?

15:02.151 --> 15:04.278
You want to know
why I'm so nervous all the time?

15:07.865 --> 15:08.949
Uh…

15:09.700 --> 15:10.868
I don't know. [chuckles]

15:10.951 --> 15:13.787
I've always been very terrified of firsts.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.707
First day of school, camp, church,

15:17.166 --> 15:18.709
all the new faces watching me,

15:18.792 --> 15:20.419
just waiting for me to screw up.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.421
[scoffs]

15:22.504 --> 15:23.505
First day of fifth grade,

15:23.589 --> 15:26.216
when Mrs. Deloitte
asked me what 6 times 9 was,

15:26.300 --> 15:28.302
I told the whole class it was 45.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.722
Yeah, I can still hear them
laughing at me.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.935
And two nights ago,
I dreamt I was standing

15:36.018 --> 15:37.728
in front of Mrs. Deloitte's class again.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.021
Couldn't wait to wake up.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.731
But when I did,

15:41.273 --> 15:43.400
I realized that if I got
the answer wrong today,

15:43.484 --> 15:45.903
no one will laugh,
but someone may die.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.283
The kids laughed at me, too.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.497
Even though I knew 6 times 9 was 54.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.666
[chuckles]

16:00.209 --> 16:01.919
One of the amniotic sacs ruptured.

16:02.002 --> 16:02.920
The strong twin's.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.178
It's metastasized to his liver.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.763
So, what do we do?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.225
Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.395
Short recovery time, but a significant
chance his cancer returns.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.479
Care to rebut?

16:22.564 --> 16:26.151
I think we should consider
a hepatic lobectomy

16:26.652 --> 16:28.028
and lymph node dissection.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.863
Remove the affected area of the liver,

16:29.947 --> 16:32.491
all the surrounding tissue,
and every swollen node we find.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.284
And that's the aggressive approach.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.912
Longer recovery time,
high risk of complications,

16:36.996 --> 16:37.997
and, uh,

16:38.539 --> 16:40.624
admittedly, the best shot
at beating the cancer.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.377
By "complications,"
you mean a barely functioning liver,

16:43.460 --> 16:45.796
a persistent threat of fatal bleeds,
and chronic pain.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.257
As surgeons, you can gut him,
but as his primary doctor,

16:48.340 --> 16:51.176
I have to find the balance
between longevity and quality of life.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.054
Last week, you were trying to perform
surgery from the gallery,

16:54.138 --> 16:55.597
and now you hate surgeons.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.598
Pick a side.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.852
[Asher] A piecemeal approach
is not going to work with Billy.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.812
Every time we try to solve a problem,

17:01.895 --> 17:03.439
we discover another one.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.315
You may have left
your religion in Brooklyn,

17:05.399 --> 17:07.526
but you keep looking
for meaning in random events.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.652
The dice have no memory.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.988
I'm not looking for meaning.
I'm looking for patterns.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.906
Maybe he's got some underlying condition.

17:13.949 --> 17:14.950
I agree with Asher.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.327
The dice have no memory,
but they can be loaded.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.790
So… safe and seriously compromised

17:21.874 --> 17:23.792
or aggressive and possibly dead?

17:27.296 --> 17:28.297
Your case, Dr. Browne.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.341
Your call.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.436
How you feeling?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.355
You sacrificed a lot.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.857
Your hands, your career.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.068
And you're taking it out on me and Claire

17:49.151 --> 17:50.694
and the whole surgical profession.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.404
I get it. It hurts.

17:54.031 --> 17:54.865
You're pathetic.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.451
You're worried about me
because I'll never be a surgeon?

17:57.534 --> 17:58.368
Boo-hoo.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.454
You're worried about me
because I took pleasure

18:00.537 --> 18:02.039
in screwing with you and Claire?

18:02.122 --> 18:03.582
That's who I am.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.250
The question is, who are you?

18:05.334 --> 18:07.294
You don't show up late
with lame-ass excuses,

18:07.377 --> 18:09.379
and when you get dissed,
you diss back, so…

18:10.589 --> 18:11.965
How are you feeling?

18:13.300 --> 18:14.384
Forget I asked.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.266
He's lost most of his amniotic fluid.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.976
Won't last very long in utero.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.480
In helping the weak, we hurt the strong.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.523
C-section?

18:27.606 --> 18:30.234
If we do a C-section
to save the strong baby,

18:30.317 --> 18:32.486
there's a 90% chance
the weak baby will die.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.948
But if we do an amnioinfusion
to save the weak baby,

18:36.031 --> 18:39.451
there's an 85% chance
that strong baby will die.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.578
It's the better option.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.166
5% to decide which baby lives?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.377
Kenzie's body
has already made that choice.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.337
If there's a strong baby and a weak baby,

18:50.420 --> 18:51.880
it's pretty clear which one we save.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.173
Survival of the fittest.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.302
Sorry. It's just…

18:58.887 --> 19:02.224
That's not really what we're about, is it,
as a civilization?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.726
Aren't the strong morally obligated
to help the weak?

19:04.810 --> 19:07.896
And if they don't,
isn't everybody ultimately worse off?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.651
Neither baby has to die.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.321
Delayed interval delivery.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.283
We induce labor,
deliver the strong twin,

19:19.366 --> 19:21.827
then stop the labor
to keep the weak twin in utero

19:21.910 --> 19:23.620
until his lungs mature.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.456
The chances of stopping labor
are very slim.

19:26.540 --> 19:30.252
That's true. There's about a 70% chance
that both babies would die.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.212
Which makes it the worst possible choice.

19:32.963 --> 19:33.964
We need to ask Kenzie.

19:34.047 --> 19:34.965
No, we don't.

19:35.757 --> 19:39.219
Once she hears there's the slightest
chance of saving both babies,

19:39.303 --> 19:41.388
she won't listen to any alternatives.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.891
Statistically, it's a terrible option.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.144
But it is an option.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.950
No. No, you can't
seriously be asking me this.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.204
I know that this is something
no mother should ever have to decide.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.789
There are no good options here,

20:07.873 --> 20:10.500
but there is one
that'll most likely make you the mother

20:10.584 --> 20:12.211
of a healthy baby boy.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.094
Okay.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.431
Prep for an amnioinfusion…

20:24.514 --> 20:26.058
Have you named them?

20:26.141 --> 20:27.226
Dr. Allen.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.569
Braydon and…

20:39.279 --> 20:40.364
Landon.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.953
[crying] No. No, I can't do this.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.208
You have to save both of them.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.421
[Claire] We're at the tumor.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.924
Unipolar ablation probe?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.635
Pretty cool to think
that we diagnosed Billy

21:01.718 --> 21:03.387
with metastatic melanoma on Tuesday

21:03.470 --> 21:05.097
and send him home on a Thursday.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.851
[Claire] Well, let's wait till Friday
to congratulate ourselves.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.145
Current at 480 hertz, please.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.024
Wait.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.360
-We got a leak. Bile duct.
-[rapid beeping]

21:18.443 --> 21:20.862
Suction, suture, linear stapler, stat.

21:30.914 --> 21:31.915
[door opens]

21:38.964 --> 21:40.549
I believe she made the right choice.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.301
She made a choice
any mother would make

21:42.384 --> 21:44.469
because the alternative is unthinkable.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.972
Isn't that exactly
what made it the right choice?

21:47.055 --> 21:48.473
She has to live with it.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.560
The safe choice
is not always the best choice.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.396
If it were, I'd be on an army base
in Germany,

21:55.355 --> 21:57.774
married to 1st Lieutenant Dwayne Buckman.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.697
[knock on door]

22:05.782 --> 22:07.409
Dr. Andrews, you wanted to see me?

22:08.118 --> 22:10.037
Yes, Dr. Jackson. Please come in.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.958
"Dr. Jackson."

22:15.042 --> 22:17.252
I cannot say those two words
without grinning!

22:17.336 --> 22:18.754
-I know.
-[both laugh]

22:20.547 --> 22:21.381
So?

22:21.798 --> 22:23.675
Uh, just checking in with you, Livy.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.385
[sighs]

22:25.469 --> 22:27.220
Like you do with all your first-years?

22:27.304 --> 22:29.056
You wanted hands off.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.099
You're getting hands off.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.518
But I can still say hi to my niece.

22:33.935 --> 22:34.936
[laughs]

22:35.645 --> 22:37.564
It looks like
you're settling in pretty well.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.358
No, the way you spoke up yesterday…

22:40.901 --> 22:42.736
I mean, that's a tough case, tough crowd,

22:42.819 --> 22:44.071
but you held your own.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.739
I'm getting there.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.116
Dr. Murphy's been very supportive.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.577
Murphy? Yeah, I'm glad to hear it.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.162
I'm sure he sees your potential.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.041
-But if you need anything, you…
-Mm.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.959
…ask anyone but me.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.878
Very hands off.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.546
Hmm.

23:09.137 --> 23:12.224
Shaun, this is not an argument

23:12.307 --> 23:14.935
I ever thought
I'd have to have with a boyfriend,

23:15.018 --> 23:16.728
whether moving in together matters.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.563
It so obviously does.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.274
It so obviously changes everything.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.112
But

23:25.529 --> 23:28.615
one of the reasons
I'm in this relationship

23:29.699 --> 23:31.827
[sighs] is because of that.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.371
You are different.

23:34.454 --> 23:37.707
And when I think about us,
say, a year from now,

23:37.791 --> 23:39.543
I can't imagine us not living together.

23:39.626 --> 23:42.712
So, if it's inevitable…

23:46.091 --> 23:47.175
Shaun,

23:47.843 --> 23:50.470
I am moving in with you.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.020
Does that mean

23:59.437 --> 24:02.941
you think we have
enough commitment and trust?

24:05.235 --> 24:06.444
Honestly…

24:08.613 --> 24:10.365
I'm not sure.

24:13.785 --> 24:14.786
So,

24:15.871 --> 24:19.082
you want to do it
just because it's inevitable?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.586
Mm. That makes it sound terrible.

24:22.669 --> 24:26.423
But that is kind of how I feel,

but when it's really over,

27:28.146 --> 27:29.230
it hurts.

27:30.106 --> 27:34.069
And I'm pissed at myself for being hurt,

27:34.152 --> 27:36.613

to the coldest person I know.

The leak in your bile duct

Never used one before,

30:25.198 --> 30:26.699
And for some reason,

I pulled over and changed their tire.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.204
As I was leaving,

30:31.746 --> 30:34.374
I told them, "Good timing.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.710
Costco's got a sale on tires."

30:41.756 --> 30:44.175
That's when I heard Linda's laugh.

She moved in with us

40:21.168 --> 40:24.213
make cupcakes,
something out of papier-mâché,

40:24.296 --> 40:27.258

to be that kind of person for you.
