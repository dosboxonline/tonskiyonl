WEBVTT

01:35.617 --> 01:38.141
-Hah! Hah!

01:38.315 --> 01:40.883
- Hah! Hah!

01:41.057 --> 01:42.841
Hah!

01:43.015 --> 01:44.930
- Hah! Hah!

02:17.659 --> 02:18.747
It's freezing.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.232
- Nah, that doesn't sound good.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.887
- Bike, bike, bike, bike! Whoa!

04:42.238 --> 04:44.371
So, a photon is checking
into a hotel.

04:44.545 --> 04:45.763
Can we not do jokes
right now, please?

04:45.937 --> 04:46.851
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.552
-Whoa!

04:51.726 --> 04:53.336
-Red light! Red light!

04:53.510 --> 04:54.816
The bellhop asks,

04:54.990 --> 04:56.383
"Do you need help
with your luggage?"

04:56.557 --> 04:57.775
To which the photon responds,
"No, thanks.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.081
I'm traveling light."

04:59.255 --> 05:01.083
- Wow.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.781
Hey, can we get some air going
back here? It's like a furnace.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.697
-No air.

05:07.742 --> 05:08.917
Also no power.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.484
Trev, we need power!

05:10.658 --> 05:12.137
Can you not talk to me
like that, please?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.270
- I'm 18 now. I'm an adult.
-Oh, come on.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.707
- We're on a job, buddy.
- I'm not getting paid.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.666
- Are you getting paid? Cool.
- No.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.015
Does anyone else
feel exploited?

05:20.189 --> 05:21.364
We're all being paid--

05:21.538 --> 05:22.322
- with memories.

05:22.496 --> 05:23.627
- Ow!

05:23.801 --> 05:25.455
- Oh, you're fine.
-Oh.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.718
Actually, guys, I'm fine.
Mom says I'm fine. Welcome.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.507
Oh!

05:33.681 --> 05:35.813
Wonderful news from the back
seat. The windows are stuck.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.380
I can open a door.

05:37.554 --> 05:38.729
- No, no, no. No!
- No, Pheebs, no. We said!

05:38.903 --> 05:39.817
Not during rush hour.
No gunner seat.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.702
Ugh. Gross.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.791
It's the Hell's Kitchen
Sewer Dragon.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.709
Hold on to your ass!

06:07.367 --> 06:08.672
- I'm going out.
- Phoebe.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.066
- What, Callie?
- I'm Mom. You call me Mom.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.720
Call me Gary,
or whatever you want.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.678
- I-I don't care.
- We're gonna lose him.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.464
Phoebe Spengler,
you stay inside this car.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.161
I have a ghost to bust.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.731
All right. That was cool.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.515
- Gary, come on.
- No, I know. I'm sorry.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.038
It's just, the way she said it,
it sounded cool.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.825
Get back in here!

06:30.999 --> 06:33.175
I can't hear you
over the nuclear accelerator.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.017
Whoa!

06:50.018 --> 06:52.847
- Drop it!
-Okay. Maybe a "please."

06:59.723 --> 07:01.812
- I'm sweating bullets.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.165
In pursuit.

07:07.339 --> 07:08.558
Nah.

07:08.950 --> 07:09.907
They got it.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.478
These roads are screwed.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.175
- Try driving a ten-ton hearse.
- I have.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.612
And if you give me the keys,

07:18.786 --> 07:19.874
- then maybe we...
- Not now, Trevor.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.095
Now! Trevor!

07:24.269 --> 07:25.488
Pop it, Trev!

07:38.719 --> 07:40.721
- I'm out of range.
- On it.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.729
Good luck, Mom.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.564
- Come on.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.670
- Later, gator.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.372
Got it!

08:23.546 --> 08:24.329
- You got it?
- Yeah! Got it!

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
- Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

08:26.680 --> 08:28.072
- Whoo!

08:28.246 --> 08:29.596
Phoebe!

08:49.920 --> 08:52.880
Everyone okay?
Oh, God.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.448
Who puts bikes there?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.850
The city ground
to a halt today

09:07.024 --> 09:09.244
as a high-speed ghost chase
tore up

09:09.418 --> 09:10.637
portions of Lower Manhattan.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.203
Honestly, looking at this,

09:12.377 --> 09:13.770
I'm surprised
nobody got killed.

09:13.944 --> 09:14.815
We haven't seen
the Ghostbusters

09:14.989 --> 09:16.294
cause this much damage since

09:16.468 --> 09:19.646
the Statue of Liberty
debacle of 1989.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.256
Last year, descendants of

09:21.430 --> 09:23.127
original Ghostbusters founder
Egon Spengler

09:23.301 --> 09:26.130
were handed the keys
to the derelict firehouse,

09:26.304 --> 09:27.654
bankrolled by philanthropist

09:27.828 --> 09:30.004
and former Ghostbuster
Winston Zeddemore.

09:30.178 --> 09:33.181
And though it's been decades
since New Yorkers cheered...

09:33.355 --> 09:34.617
♪ Ghostbusters! ♪

09:34.791 --> 09:37.054
Break out the new equipment!

09:37.228 --> 09:38.969
The Nutrona Blaster charged!

09:39.143 --> 09:40.710
...today's question
isn't, "Who you gonna call?"

09:40.884 --> 09:43.408
It's, "Who's gonna pay
for this mess?"

09:43.583 --> 09:46.498
Three lampposts,
two parked Priuses,

09:46.673 --> 09:49.110
an entire fleet
of rental bikes.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.331
That is a lot of damage.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.551
Yeah, but you can't have
a Sewer Dragon

09:55.725 --> 09:57.422
flying around SoHo
like it's Middle-earth.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.991
You have someone hanging out
the side of a moving vehicle,

10:01.165 --> 10:03.385
firing a laser gun
indiscriminately...

10:03.559 --> 10:06.170
Laser gun? What?
That's a proton pack.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.519
It's a weapon.

10:07.694 --> 10:08.608
A weapon of science.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.305
It's completely safe.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.698
It's not completely safe.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.569
It's a portable
proton accelerator.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.049
How old are you?

10:15.223 --> 10:16.398
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.269
I'm not talking to you. Her.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.273
- Fifteen.
- A minor.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.362
We don't let kids become cops,

10:24.536 --> 10:26.060
we don't let them fight fires,

10:26.234 --> 10:29.193
and we certainly don't let them
become Ghostbusters.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.065
- Uh, Mister-Mister...
- Sir.

10:31.239 --> 10:32.980
I-I'm sorry. Uh, Mr. Mayor,
m-may I approach the bench?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.852
Do you see a robe?
I am not a judge.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.902
Gary.

10:42.076 --> 10:45.645
Uh, look, uh, y-you don't know
Phoebe Spengler like-like I do.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.125
I mean, she is something else,
this kid.

10:48.299 --> 10:50.780
Honestly, she's more focused,
more accomplished,

10:50.954 --> 10:53.304
more capable than just about
any other adult I know.

10:53.478 --> 10:57.091
And what exactly is your
relationship to this minor?

10:57.613 --> 10:59.049
Are you her parent?

10:59.528 --> 11:00.703
I mean...

11:01.617 --> 11:03.793
Labels.
No, I'm her step-teacher.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.404
Mr. Grooberson,
you are not her father.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.841
You are her employer.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.407
No, uh, we don't pay her.

11:10.582 --> 11:11.714
Sounds like we can add
child labor

11:11.888 --> 11:12.933
- to our list of violations.
- Uh...

11:13.107 --> 11:14.717
- Gary.
-Yeah.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.937
Maybe she can become
a junior Ghostbuster,

11:17.111 --> 11:19.156
hand out stickers or something.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.810
As for the rest of you,

11:20.984 --> 11:22.812
I am personally holding you
responsible,

11:22.986 --> 11:26.773
and I won't stop until
that firehouse you call a home

11:26.947 --> 11:28.383
is a pile of bricks.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.391
Mom?

11:36.565 --> 11:38.045
The ceiling's leaking again.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.699
Sounds like a fun mystery
for a boy detective.

11:39.873 --> 11:40.961
Yeah, the mystery
of the black mold.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.789
Super fun mystery,
and you're gone.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.878
- Awesome. Awesome.

11:45.052 --> 11:48.011
- Flight suit.
-It's not fair.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.840
Maybe you can spend the next few
years being an actual teenager.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.320
Yeah, well,
if this was the 18th century,

11:52.494 --> 11:53.800
then I'd already be
a part of the workforce

11:53.974 --> 11:54.931
and I'd have four kids.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.586
Aw. So I'd be a grandmother.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.328
No, you would be dead.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.157
So sweet.
A ghost grandma.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.941
- Ooh, tacos.
- Ooh.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.769
Hey, look what I found
for movie night.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.075
Is that family friendly?

12:08.249 --> 12:09.772
I hope not.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.426
It's about a family--
a family that eats people.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.819
They're sisters.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.298
- Trap.
- If that counts for anything.

12:14.472 --> 12:15.778
I'm gonna take this
to the labor board.

12:15.952 --> 12:16.779
- On what grounds?
- I'm a Ghostbuster.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.346
I saved the world.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.695
Well, I like to think
we saved the world.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.479
Hey, could you, uh,
watch my beans?

12:21.653 --> 12:23.090
You were a possessed canine.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.309
-Ghost dog!

12:25.919 --> 12:27.921
This is insane.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.575
Man, they got into
the snacks again!

12:30.750 --> 12:31.925
So you're gonna make me wait
till I'm 18?

12:32.099 --> 12:33.709
Aw, it's just three years.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.624
- Be young. Live a little.
-This is the time

12:35.798 --> 12:37.974
in your life when it's okay to
screw up, make some mistakes.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.063
Yeah, you have the rest of
your life to be a Ghostbuster.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.935
Okay, well, three years
is nothing for you guys.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.546
It's a tiny, negligible
percentage of your lifespan.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.113
- She means we're old.
- Yeah, I got that.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.028
You're not the only
Spengler here, you know.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.551
Okay, well, this is my calling.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.945
You just, like, decided
to be a Ghostbuster.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.511
So did I.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.557
I mean, I was studying
earthquakes in Oklahoma.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.037
Then I went to dinner
with your mom and...

12:57.211 --> 12:58.647
- ...we turned into dogs.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.301
And fulfilled
an ancient prophecy

13:00.475 --> 13:01.519
that almost brought about
the end of the world.

13:01.693 --> 13:02.869
Now, that's a first date.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.827
We both got some action.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.873
- Yeah, we did.
- Okay, gross.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.266
For you, I get it--
you're a scientist--

13:09.440 --> 13:10.790
but... she's just...

13:10.964 --> 13:13.488
Choose your next words
very carefully.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.188
I didn't think
she even knew those words.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.060
You could've backed me up.
It's great you're their buddy,

13:20.234 --> 13:22.410
but sometimes you need
to be an asshole.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.064
Well, is that really my place?

13:24.238 --> 13:25.239
I hope so.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.110
I... You know.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.372
I want to be more
than just their buddy.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.070
I just don't know
what's allowed.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.550
Permission granted.

13:33.421 --> 13:35.423
Okay. Great.

13:37.164 --> 13:40.254
Although I got to warn you,
I mean, I can be scary.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.559
Yeah, you're a monster.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.128
You have no i...

13:45.302 --> 13:47.217
- Don't look at me that way.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.829
You laugh... Hey!
You laughing in my face?!

13:50.003 --> 13:51.831
I'm so sorry.
That was really bad.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.964
I-I scare myself sometimes.
I'll be nice to you.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.574
I'll just be an asshole
to your kids.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.228
That's what I want.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.274
All right, who's hungry?

14:14.636 --> 14:16.768
Is the containment unit okay?

14:16.943 --> 14:19.206
Come on, there's always room
for one more ghost.

14:22.209 --> 14:24.776
When the...
when the light is green...

14:24.951 --> 14:26.996
Come on!

14:27.170 --> 14:28.868
When the light is green...

14:37.659 --> 14:39.879
- The trap is clean.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.454
We're rolling in three, two...

14:53.283 --> 14:57.984
Greetings, ethereal beings,
subhuman entities

14:58.158 --> 15:01.030
and spectral forms
from the great beyond

15:01.204 --> 15:04.468
and any living humans
who may be watching.

15:04.642 --> 15:07.732
Welcome to "Repossessed,"
the show where we measure

15:07.907 --> 15:10.387
the spiritual energy
of everyday objects.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.174
I'm your host,
Dr. Raymond Stantz.

15:14.348 --> 15:18.526
My, uh, young producer-intern
reminds me to ask you

15:18.700 --> 15:20.789
that if you like
what you see here,

15:20.963 --> 15:22.922
- please push...
Like.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.837
- Like... and subscribe.
- And subscribe.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.014
Now, who do we have here?

15:32.148 --> 15:33.454
- Oh.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.587
I brought my late husband
Harold's watch.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.373
He wore it every day.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.679
And now when I walk
in the room...

15:41.853 --> 15:45.074
it beeps.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.903
Well, any object
that's been exposed

15:48.077 --> 15:52.038
to a deep emotional experience
can bind a spirit.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.430
I see.

15:53.604 --> 15:54.997
An organic ghost trap,
if you will.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.173
The stronger the experience
or even trauma,

15:57.347 --> 15:58.740
the more powerful the trap.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.525
- Wow.
- The way we detect this energy

16:02.222 --> 16:03.788
is with one of these babies.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
Oh, thank you.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.836
- If there's anything there...
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.403
...this item will detect it.

16:13.233 --> 16:17.063
Harold, beep for the nice man.

16:18.499 --> 16:21.371
Are you getting anything?

16:22.329 --> 16:23.983
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but it seems that

16:24.157 --> 16:27.421
your dearly departed spirit has
left this earthly dimension.

16:29.727 --> 16:30.598
- Sorry, lady.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.034
The hammer gets the views.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.428
He was gone anyway. Next!

16:37.213 --> 16:38.519
I'm telling you,

16:38.693 --> 16:40.782
it's gonna be
another hot one out there.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.088
- In fact...

16:42.262 --> 16:44.090
- Hey, Dr. Ray.
- Phoebe!

16:44.264 --> 16:46.048
- Hot one.
-Yeah.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.398
Um, here's the sample
of mood slime you requested.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.009
Oh. Put it downstairs.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.272
Here, I'll show you.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.144
So, you're, like,
sleeping down here?

16:55.318 --> 16:57.233
Yeah. Normally,
Ray rents this place

16:57.407 --> 16:59.714
to Norwegian ghost hunting
clubs on Booking.com,

16:59.888 --> 17:01.455
and I just got lucky.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.892
It sure beats another
boring summer in Dorklahoma.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.068
So, catch anything crazy
lately?

17:06.242 --> 17:07.417
Anything try to bite
your arm off,

17:07.591 --> 17:09.593
- like Class Five, Class Seven?

17:09.767 --> 17:10.899
No, I've been benched.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.642
Oh, hold on.

17:17.514 --> 17:20.126
Mm. I told my parents
I was at Space Camp.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.565
We are go for launch.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.307
- T-minus 15,

17:27.481 --> 17:30.440
14, 13, 12...

17:30.614 --> 17:31.920
Hi.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.575
Hi.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.881
Orbit. I'll talk to you guys
later. Love you. Bye.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.970
...seven, six...

17:39.145 --> 17:40.755
- Yeah.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.155
- What are you doing?
- It's a nightmare.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.159
Ray smuggled them back
from Summerville.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.032
I'm pretty sure they're mating.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.568
Disgusting.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.539
That's odd.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.500
You the weird guy
who buys strange old things?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.373
Yeah, correct on both counts.

18:33.547 --> 18:36.071
Buddy, you just hit
the jackpot.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.029
This is all stuff
from my grandmother's.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.076
And it was passed down to her,
so it's, like, ancient-ancient.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.773
Was she a believer?

18:42.947 --> 18:44.297
Well, she believed
a lot of demented

18:44.471 --> 18:46.081
and superstitious stuff,
if that's what you mean.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.996
My kind of gal.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.911
I've learned it's always best
to knock every piece of wood

18:50.085 --> 18:51.521
and throw a coin
into every fountain.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.088
You just never know.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.872
Well, I think you lose
a lot of coins that way.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.571
- That's interesting stuff.
- It sure is.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.703
30 for the whole lot?

18:59.877 --> 19:01.792
This one's nice.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.142
Oh.

19:03.881 --> 19:04.882
Hmm.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.892
Oh, the glyphs on this.

19:15.850 --> 19:16.894
Oh, yeah. The glyph one.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.200
You know your stuff, man.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.115
That's the special piece
in there.

19:20.289 --> 19:21.595
Actually, it's in there
by mistake.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.598
I can't part with it...
for less than 50 bucks.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.426
Mezzo-Arabic?

19:27.296 --> 19:29.820
Yeah. Mezzo-Arabic.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.953
Very unique.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.651
Sixty.

19:34.825 --> 19:38.568
These kinds of brass objects
were used to trap evil spirits.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.918
Oh, you think there's
something inside it?

19:41.919 --> 19:43.269
No clue.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.879
If there is something trapped
in here,

19:45.053 --> 19:47.186
you can bet
it's for a good reason.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.057
Definitely.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.146
I'm gonna take a PKE reading.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.017
Psychokinetic energy meter.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.323
May I do that?

19:55.150 --> 19:56.369
Thank you for asking.

19:56.543 --> 19:57.979
So many places do that
without asking.

20:00.764 --> 20:01.765
Oh.

20:02.418 --> 20:03.811
Instant reaction.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.727
Whoa. Whoa.

20:09.425 --> 20:10.948
Are you above the subway line?

20:31.186 --> 20:32.405
Off-the-chart
telekinetic energy!

20:32.579 --> 20:34.320
Full-bore convective spatter!

20:34.494 --> 20:35.843
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.714
I'll take the works.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.368
Sorry, I don't have change.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.328
- Are you okay?

20:47.898 --> 20:50.249
Okay. Okay. Okay.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.520
I'm telling you,
I mean, this...

21:01.303 --> 21:02.696
This wasn't here before.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.264
It shook the whole place.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.570
Has anyone ever emptied
this containment unit?

21:07.744 --> 21:09.964
- Where, Gary? The East River?

21:10.138 --> 21:13.707
So you've just been stuffing
ghosts in there since 1984?

21:13.881 --> 21:15.404
That's the idea.

21:15.578 --> 21:18.364
All right.
Well, maybe not the best idea.

21:18.538 --> 21:21.497
I'll let Winston's engineers
know about this.

21:21.671 --> 21:23.804
Hey, by the way,
about Winston's engineers.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.545
Um, who are they?

21:25.719 --> 21:27.286
Oh, that's not for me to say.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.983
No, but what are they
working on?

21:29.157 --> 21:31.986
Is it supersecret underground
ghostbusting stuff?

21:33.204 --> 21:35.250
That's right, Gary.

21:35.424 --> 21:39.167
Supersecret underground
ghostbusting stuff.

21:39.341 --> 21:40.560
I knew it.

21:55.836 --> 21:56.793
Ugh.

21:58.665 --> 21:59.927
Mom!

22:01.624 --> 22:04.366
Mom.
There's something in the attic.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.194
You're an adult, right?

22:06.368 --> 22:07.500
Yeah.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.589
Then why don't you
take care of it?

22:10.241 --> 22:11.330
Okay.

22:11.504 --> 22:12.896
Yeah, sure. I will.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.464
I will take care of it.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.858
Do that right now.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.428
- Ow.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.965
You picked
the wrong house, bro.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.692
What the actual hell?

23:34.325 --> 23:36.023
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

23:44.423 --> 23:46.512
- Yeah.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.078
-Be safe.
-Thanks.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.428
Where do you think
you're going?

23:49.602 --> 23:50.690
You're seriously not taking me?

23:50.864 --> 23:53.170
- Don't look at him.
- I, uh...

23:53.344 --> 23:54.563
- Gary.
- Thanks for the support.

23:54.737 --> 23:55.999
- Sorry.
-What happened to you?

23:56.173 --> 23:57.523
It's nothing.
I can handle it.

23:57.697 --> 23:58.567
Did you shower,
or is that product?

23:58.741 --> 23:59.612
What? I'm a Ghostbuster.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.004
Ha-ha. Very funny.

25:37.057 --> 25:38.101
Boo.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.149
Oh.

25:44.281 --> 25:45.326
Uh, hey.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.678
You know I'm a ghost, right?

25:49.852 --> 25:51.114
Kind of figured
when the chess pieces

25:51.288 --> 25:52.725
started moving on their own.

25:56.467 --> 25:57.730
And you're not...

25:58.861 --> 26:00.559
terrified of me?

26:01.342 --> 26:03.605
No. Should I be?

26:03.779 --> 26:04.911
I just think it's kind of weird.

26:05.085 --> 26:07.217
I mean, usually,
people run by now.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.307
I can leave if you want.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.831
No, I'm not saying
you have to go.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.572
If you want to, like,
float away again,

26:13.746 --> 26:15.051
- I can pretend that I'm scared.
- No, I-I'm not saying...

26:17.663 --> 26:18.838
Still weird.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.321
Nice flames, by the way.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.846
Thanks.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.152
Yeah, I burned alive
in a horrifying tenement fire.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.677
Guess you're lucky that
you're not all crispy.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.027
I died before
my face melted off.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.202
That's a bonus.

26:41.382 --> 26:42.601
Checkmate.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.039
What? I-I don't understand.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.214
I-I can tell.

26:48.432 --> 26:49.651
Hey, don't take it too hard.

26:49.825 --> 26:52.306
I've had a lot of time
to practice.

26:53.437 --> 26:55.135
So, you got a name?

26:55.309 --> 26:56.223
Phoebe.

26:56.397 --> 26:57.920
I'm Melody.

26:58.094 --> 27:01.054
- Cool name.
- Thanks. It was a family name.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.795
I was being sarcastic.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.712
I kind of like you.

27:11.281 --> 27:14.371
What's the worst part
about being a ghost?

27:15.677 --> 27:18.027
I'll be 16
for the rest of eternity.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.856
Yikes. No matter what?

27:21.378 --> 27:23.076
Unless I...

27:23.250 --> 27:25.905
complete
my unfinished business.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.264
Then what is the best part?

27:40.397 --> 27:41.747
Doing this.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.774
Um, do you mind just...

28:09.513 --> 28:10.645
Yeah.

28:14.083 --> 28:16.085
So you're
one of Winston's guys, huh?

28:16.259 --> 28:18.609
- Gary.
- Hmm? Sorry.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.307
Does that help you
hear the ghosts?

28:20.481 --> 28:23.397
Oh, what helps me listen
to the ghosts is silence.

28:25.486 --> 28:26.487
Sorry.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.889
Okay. All right,
is something trying to get out?

28:37.672 --> 28:38.934
Many things.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.245
Is this my dad's handwriting?

28:45.419 --> 28:47.160
His design.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.858
The containment unit is
essentially a large ghost trap.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.860
That was Egon Spengler's
great vision.

28:52.034 --> 28:53.862
An articulated stream
of protons

28:54.036 --> 28:56.038
that could stabilize
the particles of a ghost.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.301
- Are you following this?
- Yeah, of course I am.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.869
After 40 years of compiling
spiritual waste...

29:01.043 --> 29:02.218
You ran out of space.

29:02.392 --> 29:03.829
Well, didn't anybody
see this coming?

29:04.003 --> 29:05.352
It was the '80s.

29:05.526 --> 29:08.355
Nobody was too worried
about the future.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.400
Then this happened.

29:11.053 --> 29:12.228
This momentary burst

29:12.402 --> 29:14.100
of spiritual energy
created a rift.

29:15.188 --> 29:18.365
It's a potential gateway
to the other side.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.541
The other side?

29:21.411 --> 29:22.935
Are we talking about...

29:23.849 --> 29:25.720
I don't know
what we're talking about.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.417
That's what scares me.

29:27.591 --> 29:32.118
Look, we didn't just buy
the firehouse for nostalgia.

29:32.292 --> 29:35.469
This building
is the finger in the dam.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.166
It's the fortification between

29:37.340 --> 29:39.952
everything we do
and don't understand.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.128
We have to protect it.

29:42.302 --> 29:45.000
O-Okay,
so the ghost compactor broke.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.220
Can't you guys
just build a new one?

29:47.394 --> 29:48.743
What-what do you mean?

29:48.917 --> 29:50.440
What do you mean,
"what do you mean?"

29:51.485 --> 29:52.791
Don't they know?

29:54.357 --> 29:55.489
We already have.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.928
WINSTON [VOICE-OVER]: While
you've been out busting ghosts,

30:00.102 --> 30:02.931
my engineers have been
thinking about our future.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.284
Once upon a time, this was
the Triborough Aquarium.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.418
Most recently, it's been
more of a squatters' paradise

30:11.592 --> 30:12.723
and rave venue.

30:19.426 --> 30:23.734
Welcome to
the Paranormal Research Center.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.128
Ghostbusting asks
a lot of questions,

30:26.302 --> 30:29.305
and now we have a place
to find the answers.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.655
We have a parabotanist.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.397
We even have
a paramusicologist.

30:34.571 --> 30:35.616
Hey, Lucky!

30:38.837 --> 30:40.012
Lucky!

30:47.280 --> 30:50.457
- Trevor?
- Hey! You're here.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.288
Uh, when you said
you were interning,

30:55.462 --> 30:56.767
I didn't know you'd be
blowing stuff away with lasers.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.291
I know, right?
Just a little upgrade.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.075
Of course, you all know Lars,

31:00.249 --> 31:02.861
our resident parabiologist.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.471
Oh, no way.

31:04.645 --> 31:05.733
I used to have one of these.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.389
Mind your fingers.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.436
It's possessed
by an evil Spin Doctors CD.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.177
Ray Stantz has generously

31:15.351 --> 31:19.007
provided us with a collection
of spirit-loaded items.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.749
So, everything
in this place is haunted?

31:21.923 --> 31:23.359
Indeed.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.405
Look, here's a rare find.

31:25.579 --> 31:28.016
This grandfather clock
is inhabited by the spirit

31:28.190 --> 31:29.975
of an actual grandfather.

31:34.414 --> 31:37.243
Any emotionally charged object
can contain a ghost,

31:37.417 --> 31:40.768
as long as it's experienced
some sort of horrific event.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.378
By exciting the atoms,
we're able to create

31:42.552 --> 31:45.033
a fluid moment
of chemical transition.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.862
Then we simply lock
onto the spirit...

31:50.038 --> 31:51.866
...extract it
from its host object...

32:07.447 --> 32:11.103
...and then lovingly deposit it
into our second chamber...

32:13.235 --> 32:16.021
...so it can be
properly disposed of.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.203
Have you made any attempts
on living possession?

32:24.377 --> 32:26.509
Oh, w-we're still tweaking.

32:31.819 --> 32:34.126
Now, I didn't want
to show it until it was ready,

32:34.300 --> 32:37.781
but this is what
I brought you here to see.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.306
Our new containment unit,

32:40.480 --> 32:43.265
based on Egon's
original design.

32:43.439 --> 32:46.747
It can spin the equivalent
of 50 million cubic hectares

32:46.921 --> 32:49.010
of plasmic confinement.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.491
A psychic jail as big
as the American West.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.754
"Home on the Strange."

32:53.928 --> 32:56.583
Oh. Where the specters
and entities play.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.498
- Where the...
- Yeah.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.717
How long would it take
to move the ghosts

33:00.891 --> 33:02.415
from the firehouse to here?

33:02.589 --> 33:04.243
If we went trap by trap
on regular shifts,

33:04.417 --> 33:07.681
it could take anywhere between
three to seven years.

33:07.855 --> 33:09.552
Oh, so...
so soon-ish.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.119
Oh, I almost forgot.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.860
We don't exactly know
what it is,

33:13.034 --> 33:14.514
but it broke the PKE meter.

33:14.688 --> 33:16.733
Good luck extracting
whatever's inside it.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.257
Fun.

33:18.431 --> 33:19.780
Yeah, we're still
workshopping names.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.521
Uh, I personally like
the Little Ball of Hate

33:21.695 --> 33:23.479
or Devil's Testicle.

33:23.653 --> 33:25.568
Thank you, Podcast.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.309
Yeah. You're welcome.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.537
- What's in here?

33:37.711 --> 33:41.149
Wait, do you keep ghosts
just hanging out in here?

33:41.323 --> 33:42.759
We spent a long time
trapping them.

33:42.933 --> 33:44.283
Now we can study them.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.241
Why don't they escape?

33:46.415 --> 33:48.896
- Barrier of proton fields.
-Precisely.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.159
It's the same technology
as in your packs.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.422
We use it
in all the enclosures.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.863
- Oh.
He's cute.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.127
- Yeah.
- Hey, buddy.

34:06.479 --> 34:07.784
Now, this one is the most

34:07.958 --> 34:09.177
threatening pest
in the whole complex.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.484
- Possessor.

34:12.963 --> 34:14.313
This spry little weasel

34:14.487 --> 34:17.055
can occupy any inanimate matter
it wants.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.669
Extremely dangerous.

34:40.774 --> 34:41.818
Hey.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.218
You're good.

35:10.804 --> 35:13.023
Pheebs.
Am I doing something wrong?

35:13.198 --> 35:14.460
It's not working.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.201
Can you help me?

35:17.506 --> 35:20.466
The cyclotron isn't... cycling.

35:22.729 --> 35:23.904
Can you help me out?

35:27.255 --> 35:29.692
- Whoa.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.216
You fixed it.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.739
- Literally just unplugged.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.918
I know it sucks right now.
I-I do.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.748
But it's just temporary.
And time flies by.

35:41.922 --> 35:44.011
I promise you. I should know.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.578
Two years ago,
I was in Oklahoma,

35:45.752 --> 35:47.623
and now I'm here...

35:47.797 --> 35:49.538
with a proton pack.

35:49.712 --> 35:52.411
I was your
science teacher, and now I'm...

35:55.762 --> 35:57.372
Well, now I'm...

35:57.546 --> 36:00.114
- And I'm your, um...

36:00.288 --> 36:02.247
We got a call downtown!

36:02.725 --> 36:04.205
Trev, let's go!

36:06.729 --> 36:07.730
Sorry.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.631
Hello? Anybody there?

36:38.805 --> 36:40.589
Gh-Ghostbusters.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.809
Oh, good.
We need someone right away.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.646
All right.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.256
We're back, baby.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.824
Ghostbusters are back.
Back in the big city.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.347
Back in the Big Apple.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.349
Gonna take a bite
out of the Big Apple.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.221
Phoebe, Podcast.

37:03.395 --> 37:04.744
Podcast and Phoebe.
Can't keep us apart.

37:04.918 --> 37:06.311
Dynamic duo.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.790
What are we catching tonight?

37:34.513 --> 37:36.123
Can't play right now.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.519
I know you see me working.

37:41.998 --> 37:44.479
If you're good, later on,
you'll get a tennis ball.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.529
Let's see
what you've got in you.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.723
Something wrong?

38:21.603 --> 38:24.127
I think it's
fighting extraction.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.825
Not for this long. The...

38:37.315 --> 38:39.404
- Uh...
- Okay.

38:39.578 --> 38:41.014
- Small thing.
- Uh-huh.

38:41.188 --> 38:43.103
Need to wait for the generators
to warm back up.

38:43.277 --> 38:44.626
Until then...

38:46.149 --> 38:47.499
the proton fields are down.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.198
Okay. Uh...

38:53.809 --> 38:55.115
Do you hear that?

39:14.787 --> 39:18.138
Lars. Why haven't the ghosts
escaped yet?

39:30.803 --> 39:32.805
Okay, we need to shut
that thing up.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.518
This is the place.

39:51.171 --> 39:52.390
Yeah.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.089
They better have baklava.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.054
Hi.

40:05.228 --> 40:06.491
You here for the ghost?

40:24.683 --> 40:25.684
Boo.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.338
Phoebe?

40:28.513 --> 40:30.036
- Uh...
- Blast it.

40:30.210 --> 40:31.777
"It"?

40:31.951 --> 40:33.474
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Who's the third wheel?

40:33.648 --> 40:35.520
Why are you just
standing there? Fire!

40:35.955 --> 40:37.086
Uh...

40:39.567 --> 40:40.699
What are you doing?!

40:40.873 --> 40:42.614
- You missed!
-Oh!

41:23.393 --> 41:25.613
- If... I have great aim.
- Cool.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.833
And if I wanted to hit you,
then I would've, but I didn't.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.443
- Right.
- If it...

41:29.617 --> 41:31.619
If it makes you
feel better, I guess.

41:31.793 --> 41:34.622
Yeah, I just feel, like,
a warm rush of relief.

41:35.841 --> 41:36.798
Oh.

41:38.104 --> 41:39.497
Phew.

41:40.062 --> 41:41.194
So...

41:42.151 --> 41:43.588
do you want to hang out?

41:43.762 --> 41:45.503
You're inviting me in?

41:48.462 --> 41:50.638
Um, sure. Yeah.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.031
You're inviting me inside

41:52.205 --> 41:54.163
your ghost extermination
headquarters?

41:54.337 --> 41:57.471
Uh, yeah, no, it's fine.
I see how that could be weird.

41:57.645 --> 41:59.299
It's cool. You don't have to...

41:59.473 --> 42:00.692
Nice digs.

42:03.390 --> 42:05.218
You can transapparate?

42:05.392 --> 42:07.133
Oh, is that what I just did?

42:07.307 --> 42:08.787
Yeah, I do that.

42:09.831 --> 42:11.354
How do you touch
the chess pieces if...?

42:11.529 --> 42:12.878
Basically, I exist on

42:13.052 --> 42:14.444
an entirely different
dimensional plane.

42:14.619 --> 42:15.881
You wouldn't get it.

42:16.055 --> 42:17.839
I get it.
I love dimensional planes.

42:18.013 --> 42:20.320
I've always wanted to visit
a different dimensional plane.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.148
I don't know why
I said that. I...

42:26.021 --> 42:30.069
So, like, is the rest
of this place this cool or...?

42:35.161 --> 42:36.641
That's our car.

42:37.119 --> 42:38.120
And...

42:39.208 --> 42:41.994
this is my locker.

42:42.168 --> 42:43.604
That's my name.

42:52.221 --> 42:54.180
Oh, uh, that's where we...

42:54.354 --> 42:56.095
I know what this is.

42:58.793 --> 43:01.361
Have you ever wondered
what happens...

43:03.015 --> 43:04.886
...when we're all done here?

43:07.497 --> 43:08.673
I mean, I've seen it.

43:12.546 --> 43:14.330
Yeah, I mean, it's...

43:14.504 --> 43:16.202
it's really beautiful, actually.

43:16.376 --> 43:19.422
I mean, your particles start
to lose their bonds

43:19.597 --> 43:22.687
and float off into space.

43:24.036 --> 43:25.254
Then what?

43:25.428 --> 43:26.821
Quantum physics suggests
that we become

43:26.995 --> 43:28.910
a part of the fabric
of the universe.

43:30.346 --> 43:31.652
Do you believe that?

43:31.826 --> 43:33.175
I mean, I believe
in quantum physics.

43:33.349 --> 43:35.047
Duh.

43:36.352 --> 43:37.702
Sounds cool.

43:37.876 --> 43:39.573
Maybe I'll be able
to check it out someday.

43:39.747 --> 43:42.010
When you cross
to the other side?

43:43.055 --> 43:44.360
Yeah.

43:44.534 --> 43:45.971
That's where my family is.

43:46.754 --> 43:48.277
Why can't you join them?

43:49.104 --> 43:51.411
If I knew,
I'd already be there.

43:58.026 --> 44:00.072
Is, uh, that your object?

44:00.681 --> 44:01.900
My what?

44:02.074 --> 44:03.945
It's like an emotionally
charged anchor

44:04.119 --> 44:06.774
that keeps us tethered
to this world.

44:06.948 --> 44:09.516
Well, the last match burned
my family alive, so...

44:09.690 --> 44:12.258
Yeah, well, that'll do it.

44:12.432 --> 44:14.086
No, it was an accident.

44:16.697 --> 44:18.177
- Oh, I...
- I used to think

44:18.351 --> 44:20.048
these matches were
some sort of key to moving on,

44:20.222 --> 44:24.052
but I've gotten used to the idea
that I'm not going anywhere.

44:26.098 --> 44:28.230
- I'm sorry.
-Pheebs?

44:30.232 --> 44:31.233
You okay down there?

44:31.407 --> 44:32.452
Um...

44:33.671 --> 44:35.760
Uh, I'll be right up.

45:44.045 --> 45:45.568
I'm going as fast as I can.

45:49.877 --> 45:51.574
Does it have to be her?

45:57.624 --> 45:59.191
I understand.

46:28.481 --> 46:29.874
Hey, pal.

46:30.875 --> 46:32.877
Got some Cheetos for you.

46:33.051 --> 46:35.444
You can come on out.

46:35.618 --> 46:38.056
I'm only gonna shoot you
in the face.

46:40.319 --> 46:41.886
Come on.

47:06.606 --> 47:07.607
That's it.

47:10.697 --> 47:12.438
Huh? The hell?

47:18.052 --> 47:19.271
-Phoebe?

47:19.445 --> 47:20.707
- You okay?
- Yeah.

47:20.881 --> 47:22.317
Basement. Now.

47:35.461 --> 47:36.941
Can you explain this?

47:39.769 --> 47:41.162
No, I can't.

47:52.478 --> 47:54.349
- Cool.
- Empirically.

47:54.523 --> 47:58.005
Approaching the mythically cold
temperature of absolute zero,

47:58.179 --> 48:00.573
the degree at which
all particles stop.

48:00.747 --> 48:02.227
Zero kelvin.

48:02.401 --> 48:05.578
The suspension of life itself.
Exquisite.

48:05.752 --> 48:07.232
If you like that...

48:08.102 --> 48:10.539
- you're gonna love this.

48:18.460 --> 48:20.767
Ever since you brought in
this lethal snow cone,

48:20.941 --> 48:23.074
the other ghosts have been
acting peculiar.

48:23.248 --> 48:24.771
We think it's communicating.

48:24.945 --> 48:26.381
So the orb's kind of chatty?

48:26.555 --> 48:28.253
Not the orb itself
but whatever lies within it.

48:28.427 --> 48:29.863
We think it's commanding
the other ghosts

48:30.037 --> 48:32.518
with some sort of mind control.

48:37.044 --> 48:38.567
All right.

48:54.540 --> 48:55.845
- Wow.
Oh.

48:56.020 --> 48:57.978
Extreme thermodynamic
"exutions,"

48:58.152 --> 48:59.458
thought transference...

48:59.632 --> 49:01.286
This little cutie gets out,

49:01.460 --> 49:03.505
no telling how dangerous
it could be.

49:07.248 --> 49:09.947
Where the hell did you guys
get this thing?

49:23.047 --> 49:24.744
Hey, man.

49:24.918 --> 49:28.226
- Hey.
- Are you Nadeem Razmaadi?

49:29.357 --> 49:30.576
Maybe.

49:30.750 --> 49:31.969
Did you recently sell
a collection

49:32.143 --> 49:34.406
of family artifacts
to Ray Stantz?

49:36.886 --> 49:38.323
- That money's gone.
-Wait.

49:40.934 --> 49:43.197
Uh, we're not looking
for a refund. We...

49:43.371 --> 49:44.851
Come on in.

49:45.025 --> 49:46.548
I got a bunch of other stuff
for sale.

49:46.722 --> 49:50.161
I am a licensed third-party
reseller of sneakers.

49:50.335 --> 49:52.293
- What's your shoe size, my man?
-Uh, ten.

49:52.467 --> 49:54.556
I don't have any tens.
Can you squeeze into an eight?

49:54.730 --> 49:57.168
- No, probably not.
- Is this your bachelor pad?

49:57.342 --> 50:00.345
This was my dadi's place--
my grandmother's.

50:00.519 --> 50:01.433
Hmm.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.087
Nipple stuff.

50:03.261 --> 50:05.002
- Iconic.
-Oh, yeah.

50:05.176 --> 50:06.612
That was my dadi's
favorite painting.

50:06.786 --> 50:09.093
I can't really part with it.
What's your offer?

50:09.267 --> 50:11.182
What was
your grandmother's deal?

50:11.356 --> 50:14.141
We weren't really that close.
She said I was unambitious.

50:14.315 --> 50:15.664
But, really,
who's the brave one, huh?

50:15.838 --> 50:17.101
The brother who goes
to engineering school

50:17.275 --> 50:18.580
or the one who forges ahead

50:18.754 --> 50:21.061
with no education
or future prospects?

50:21.235 --> 50:22.976
The second one.

50:23.150 --> 50:24.543
- Right? Yeah.
-Yes. Absolutely.

50:24.717 --> 50:26.153
Yeah, I think that all the time.

50:26.327 --> 50:27.241
Yep. Me, too. I also think
that all the time.

50:27.415 --> 50:28.895
Hundred percent. It's heroic.

50:29.069 --> 50:29.765
Yeah, we're curious about
a particular object.

50:29.939 --> 50:31.332
Brass orb.

50:31.898 --> 50:33.595
Hurts when touched.

50:33.769 --> 50:36.076
Oh, yeah, that came from my
grandmother's special back room

50:36.250 --> 50:38.687
where she keeps
all the really good stuff.

50:38.861 --> 50:42.082
But I'm not supposed to take
anybody back there, so...

50:51.526 --> 50:52.484
Whoa.

50:53.876 --> 50:55.226
Nice sex dungeon.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.402
- Okay, dadi.
-Not a sex dungeon.

50:57.576 --> 50:59.186
Would a sex dungeon
have these chains?

50:59.360 --> 51:00.709
- Yeah, definitely.
-Yeah.

51:00.883 --> 51:02.494
As soon as I said it,
I realized it would.

51:04.409 --> 51:06.063
Seriously,
what'd she do in here?

51:06.237 --> 51:08.021
I don't know. I found
this room after she died

51:08.195 --> 51:10.110
while I was looking
for some Pop-Tarts.

51:12.634 --> 51:15.333
All this stuff is for sale, too,
by the way.

51:16.725 --> 51:19.337
- Is this brass or copper, Lars?
- Brass.

51:19.511 --> 51:21.513
Once believed to be
a magical alloy.

51:21.687 --> 51:22.992
There are countless tales

51:23.167 --> 51:24.472
of demons trapped
in brass urns and lamps,

51:24.646 --> 51:26.648
going all the way back
to the time of Solomon.

51:27.649 --> 51:29.651
Sick outfit.

51:33.177 --> 51:35.309
Whoa. You guys hear that?

51:35.483 --> 51:37.268
- No echo, no anything.

51:37.442 --> 51:39.183
It's like... it's like
a dead room in here.

51:39.357 --> 51:40.880
So she could be as loud
as she wanted.

51:41.054 --> 51:42.099
-Please stop.

51:42.273 --> 51:43.578
Please stop making sex jokes

51:43.752 --> 51:45.711
about my recently deceased
grandmother.

51:45.885 --> 51:48.888
The brass orb--
it was always kept in here?

51:49.062 --> 51:50.542
Far as I know.

51:50.716 --> 51:52.848
Is it possible she wanted
to keep it quiet?

51:58.376 --> 51:59.725
What does that mean?

52:01.335 --> 52:02.815
It means you're coming with us.

52:04.077 --> 52:05.557
PHOEBE [VOICE-OVER]: Dr. Ray?

52:05.731 --> 52:07.602
- Yes, Phoebe?
- I think that somebody left

52:07.776 --> 52:10.605
a rotting carrot
on one of your shelves.

52:10.779 --> 52:11.954
Oh, that's a human pinkie.

52:12.129 --> 52:13.695
- Picked that up

52:13.869 --> 52:15.132
at the old State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane

52:15.306 --> 52:17.917
in Pennsylvania-- haunted.

52:18.091 --> 52:19.397
And we had no equipment
back then.

52:19.571 --> 52:21.050
- Um...
- We...

52:21.225 --> 52:24.228
Actually, I had a question
I wanted to ask you.

52:26.273 --> 52:28.362
Have you ever...

52:28.536 --> 52:30.843
wondered what it would be like
to be a ghost?

52:33.933 --> 52:35.804
Every day of my life, dear.

52:36.892 --> 52:38.329
- Really?
- Sure.

52:38.503 --> 52:41.332
I mean,
how I would materialize.

52:42.071 --> 52:43.638
What's that feel like?

52:43.812 --> 52:45.684
Would it be some kind
of a visual manifestation?

52:45.858 --> 52:48.817
- I mean, if something's...

52:49.427 --> 52:51.080
What is that?

52:51.255 --> 52:54.475
Oh, um, I was just watching
a video I shot of the orb.

52:54.649 --> 52:56.085
I think the audio's
corrupted or something.

52:56.260 --> 52:58.262
It's all weird. Here.

52:58.914 --> 53:00.481
Check it out.

53:02.091 --> 53:04.790
Ancient verbiage, um...

53:04.964 --> 53:06.531
Yeah, but what language?

53:06.705 --> 53:07.793
A dead one.

53:09.055 --> 53:11.275
I know a guy who could help us.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.190
But...

53:15.801 --> 53:18.369
Should we investigate?

53:18.934 --> 53:20.545
Mm, we could.

53:21.328 --> 53:22.808
Aren't you benched?

53:22.982 --> 53:24.636
Aren't you retired?

53:24.810 --> 53:27.595
Oh.
You gonna take that from her?

53:46.484 --> 53:47.746
Hold still.

53:52.359 --> 53:53.969
What's this?

53:54.143 --> 53:56.320
It's just
a garden-variety test:

53:56.494 --> 53:59.148
Are you... a human?

53:59.323 --> 54:00.933
You should be able
to pass it easily

54:01.107 --> 54:05.851
unless you are possessed
by a cross-dimensional beast.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.550
Right, just a couple human
beings having a conversation.

54:09.724 --> 54:12.553
One of them has a pasta pot
strapped to his head.

54:12.727 --> 54:15.339
Let's start off
with a layup, okay?

54:17.732 --> 54:18.777
Puppies.

54:19.473 --> 54:22.389
Love them or kill them?

54:27.742 --> 54:28.961
I love them?

54:31.920 --> 54:32.791
That's one correct.

54:34.706 --> 54:36.316
Okay. Great.

54:36.490 --> 54:38.623
Yes, but that was very easy.

54:40.364 --> 54:43.628
Have you ever experienced
déjà vu?

54:44.542 --> 54:45.543
No.

54:45.847 --> 54:46.848
Okay.

54:48.110 --> 54:49.242
Have you ever experienced...

54:49.416 --> 54:50.809
Déjà vu?

54:52.463 --> 54:54.508
- That's pretty good.

54:57.381 --> 54:59.078
- Ow!

54:59.252 --> 55:00.949
What was that?

55:02.908 --> 55:05.214
Don't throw any more pens
at me, dude.

55:05.389 --> 55:07.086
That made you angry, did it?

55:07.260 --> 55:09.915
Yeah, it made me angry, did it.

55:11.960 --> 55:15.747
You're about
to devour a small child.

55:15.921 --> 55:19.707
Would you prefer skin on
or skinless?

55:22.493 --> 55:23.972
Okay. I'm not...

55:24.146 --> 55:25.931
This interview is over.
I'm not gonna answer that.

55:26.105 --> 55:27.976
- Refuse to answer that? Okay.
- No, no, no. I'm not refusing.

55:28.150 --> 55:31.110
Okay. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Is it a human child?

55:31.284 --> 55:32.459
Are there other kinds
of children?

55:32.633 --> 55:33.939
Are you thinking
of a specific child?

55:34.113 --> 55:35.680
Is this child related to me?

55:35.854 --> 55:37.551
- Would that be necessary?
- No, it's not necessary.

55:37.725 --> 55:38.944
You're the one
who brought it up.

55:39.118 --> 55:40.467
I don't want to eat any...

55:40.641 --> 55:42.339
- I told you to stop

55:42.513 --> 55:43.949
throwing pens at me.

55:44.123 --> 55:45.951
I'm sorry. It's a perfectly
normal reaction!

55:46.125 --> 55:47.996
Oh, oh! Don't! Okay! Okay!

55:51.522 --> 55:53.437
What are you staring at?!

56:00.095 --> 56:01.140
Did I pass?

56:15.850 --> 56:19.376
Dr. Stantz, I don't think that
this is a legal parking space.

56:19.550 --> 56:21.465
Ah, they know me here.

56:21.639 --> 56:22.814
Did you know
these two regal kittens

56:22.988 --> 56:24.206
actually have names?

56:24.381 --> 56:26.165
You have Patience
and Fortitude.

56:26.339 --> 56:27.819
Ah, no! Dr. Stantz!

56:27.993 --> 56:29.821
No, you are forbidden
from coming within

56:29.995 --> 56:31.649
50 feet of this library.

56:31.823 --> 56:33.999
Good to see you, buddy.
Been a long time, huh?

56:34.652 --> 56:35.566
Hi.

56:36.044 --> 56:37.002
Excuse us.

56:40.397 --> 56:42.834
It's not Essenic.
It's not Chaldean.

56:43.225 --> 56:44.836
It ain't French.

56:46.054 --> 56:49.318
This is pre-Sumerian.
This is pre-Sanskrit.

56:49.493 --> 56:51.103
Well, what does it mean?

56:51.277 --> 56:53.497
Five people in the world
can understand these words.

56:53.671 --> 56:57.501
Whi... which means
my colleague Dr. Jahangiri

56:57.675 --> 56:59.198
put you up to this.

57:01.156 --> 57:03.115
Jahangiri's already dead.

57:03.289 --> 57:05.378
- What?!
- No. Your colleague's...

57:05.552 --> 57:07.424
- Your colleague's fine.
Sorry.

57:07.598 --> 57:09.991
What the fudge
is wrong with you?

57:10.165 --> 57:13.517
Listen, this language has been
dead for thousands of years.

57:13.691 --> 57:15.649
How did you get this recording?

57:16.694 --> 57:18.522
Do you believe
in spiritual inhabitation?

57:19.305 --> 57:20.959
Spectral possession?

57:21.133 --> 57:23.570
Look, there's a reason
I'm down here in the basement.

57:23.744 --> 57:26.268
I'm the library folklorist.
I'm also the tristate treasurer

57:26.443 --> 57:28.053
of the H.P. Lovecraft Society,
so...

57:28.227 --> 57:30.403
Do I believe in spirits?
Yes, I believe in spirits.

57:30.577 --> 57:32.274
I believe
in self-winding clocks

57:32.449 --> 57:34.276
and the singing cheeses
of Copenhagen.

57:34.451 --> 57:35.843
Please continue.

57:36.017 --> 57:38.542
All right.
The ancient chants you heard

57:38.716 --> 57:40.848
came from
this mysterious object.

57:41.022 --> 57:42.807
It's about the size
of a boccie ball.

57:45.766 --> 57:47.159
Come with me to the library.

57:47.333 --> 57:49.596
- Are we not in the library?

57:50.249 --> 57:51.642
Upstairs is just for show.

57:51.816 --> 57:53.557
Gilded research rooms
where struggling actors

57:53.731 --> 57:56.255
can Twitch-stream
and buy crypto.

57:56.429 --> 57:59.084
The old library is below.

58:04.872 --> 58:07.527
- Welcome to the old library.
-Whoa.

58:09.355 --> 58:11.705
That object of yours--

58:12.924 --> 58:16.667
its last recorded sighting...

58:18.625 --> 58:22.063
...wasn't photographed,
and it wasn't painted.

58:23.543 --> 58:27.242
It was carved in stone.

58:28.287 --> 58:29.288
Whoa.

58:31.246 --> 58:32.900
Recognize anything?

58:33.553 --> 58:35.076
There's your orb.

58:35.468 --> 58:37.035
What is it?

58:37.209 --> 58:39.820
Well, the better question is:
What's inside of it?

58:40.691 --> 58:41.822
What's inside of it?

58:41.996 --> 58:44.433
Excellent question.
Probably sand.

58:44.608 --> 58:46.610
But if you believe
the folklore--

58:46.784 --> 58:49.134
and I always believe
the folklore--

58:49.308 --> 58:52.659
that orb is a magical prison

58:52.833 --> 58:56.141
for a phantom god
called Garraka.

58:58.447 --> 59:00.493
See, 4,000 years ago,

59:00.667 --> 59:03.278
Garraka served
a bloodthirsty king

59:03.452 --> 59:04.976
called Samudari.

59:05.150 --> 59:07.021
You know, from the Battle
of the Seven Armies,

59:07.195 --> 59:09.023
et cetera, et cetera.

59:09.197 --> 59:11.983
After Garraka helped conquer
half of Central Asia,

59:12.157 --> 59:16.030
the king grew suspicious
of his ambitions.

59:16.204 --> 59:20.034
Garraka was captured, branded,
broken and disfigured.

59:20.208 --> 59:22.471
His horns, the source
of his greatest strength,

59:22.646 --> 59:24.691
were, like, ripped
off his head.

59:24.865 --> 59:26.258
Nasty stuff.

59:26.432 --> 59:27.825
I love it. No notes.

59:27.999 --> 59:29.827
But Garraka didn't take
too kindly to that

59:30.001 --> 59:33.526
and went on a bit
of a murder bender.

59:33.700 --> 59:37.138
His plan was to raise an army
of the undead

59:37.312 --> 59:42.317
and wage war on humanity by
channeling fear into a weapon.

59:45.016 --> 59:46.365
Kusharit Umoti.

59:47.453 --> 59:49.194
The Death Chill.

59:49.368 --> 59:52.371
The power to kill
by fear itself.

59:52.545 --> 59:54.895
A cold shiver runs
down your spine.

59:55.679 --> 59:57.942
Your veins turn
to rivers of ice.

59:58.769 --> 01:00:00.248
Your bones crack.

01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:02.120
Your lungs cave.

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:03.948
And the last thing you see

01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:08.213
is your own tear ducts
freezing up.

01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:12.696
It's so cool.

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:14.915
Anyhoo, before Garraka
could collapse

01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:19.267
the collective bronchial tubes
of greater South Asia,

01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:21.705
he finally met his match.

01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:24.751
His icy spell was shattered
by a roving band

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:29.538
of mythical spirit catchers
called the Firemasters,

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:31.018
who used fire and brass

01:00:31.192 --> 01:00:35.153
to trap the evil god
inside of an orb.

01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:38.852
The very orb you now possess.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.204
Kind of like Ghostbusters.

01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:45.163
Yeah.

01:00:45.337 --> 01:00:50.081
If you're willing to entertain
a little historical gossip...

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.739
These are wax cylinders.

01:00:55.913 --> 01:00:57.610
19th-century audio recordings.

01:00:57.784 --> 01:01:00.352
Our collection is bonkers.
Here.

01:01:00.526 --> 01:01:03.268
Mary Todd Lincoln
using the f-word.

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:05.096
Apparently, she saw a moth.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:09.753
But the one I think you'll be
most interested in is...

01:01:10.318 --> 01:01:11.885
this one.

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:15.628
See, back in the Gilded Age
of our fair metropolis,

01:01:15.802 --> 01:01:17.674
there was this group
of rich assholes called

01:01:17.848 --> 01:01:21.155
the Manhattan
Adventurers Society.

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:23.114
They would steal relics
and artifacts.

01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:24.637
They'd get together.

01:01:24.811 --> 01:01:26.378
They'd enjoy them
with their Beaujolais

01:01:26.552 --> 01:01:27.727
and a couple of hookers.

01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:30.687
Real colonial loot fest
kind of stuff.

01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.776
Anyway, one night,
they took out

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:37.476
a particularly rare relic,
the Orb of Garraka.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:41.219
And then they played
this chant,

01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:44.222
which opened the orb.

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:49.662
For the first time
in New York history,

01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:53.753
a room full of people
froze to death

01:01:53.927 --> 01:01:56.147
in the middle of July.

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:16.733
Uh...

01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:18.560
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:28.745
It's the Possessor!

01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:30.485
- He's got the chant! Stop him!

01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:37.014
Stop that bag!

01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:38.842
-Excuse us!
- Wh-- Hey!

01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:40.800
-Move, move, move!
- No running!

01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:46.501
Go left!

01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:48.199
Get it!
Keep your eyes on it!

01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:52.246
Shh.

01:03:12.527 --> 01:03:13.877
Excuse me.

01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:31.808
What the hell was that?

01:03:31.982 --> 01:03:33.244
Oh, Possessor ghost.

01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:34.767
Master of concealment
and disguise.

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.508
Now it'll be
impossible to find.

01:03:36.682 --> 01:03:38.075
Oh, oh, there it is.

01:03:39.554 --> 01:03:40.991
Well, that's a close one.

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:44.124
You don't want that
getting away.

01:03:44.298 --> 01:03:45.734
- Give me a boost, will you?
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.345
I got you.

01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:51.044
Oh, my God.

01:04:05.798 --> 01:04:06.712
Dr. Ray!

01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:08.453
The bike! Push the button!

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.065
Uh...

01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:15.634
-Press the button!
- There's too many buttons!

01:04:21.118 --> 01:04:23.163
Oh!

01:04:27.733 --> 01:04:28.777
Come on!

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.956
Yes!

01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:46.404
- Podcast, do something!
- I-I'm trying!

01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:47.884
- Come on!

01:04:48.058 --> 01:04:50.451
- Hurry up! Push the button!
- I'm trying...

01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:05.684
Hands where we can see 'em!

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:08.121
- Step forward.

01:05:08.295 --> 01:05:09.993
The lions, Phoebe.

01:05:10.167 --> 01:05:12.691
They're iconic.
People love them.

01:05:12.865 --> 01:05:15.650
They make kids want
to visit the library.

01:05:15.824 --> 01:05:17.696
Do you know how hard it is

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.698
to get kids to visit
the library?

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.352
I love the library.

01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:23.571
Then why did you shoot
Fortitude in the face?

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:24.659
I was doing my job.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.139
You don't have a job!

01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:28.185
-Magnifique!

01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:30.448
My compliments to the chef.

01:05:30.622 --> 01:05:34.713
As far as fiascos go,
this was just dynamite.

01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:36.410
One would think, though,

01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:39.500
you'd have a little more respect
for the public library,

01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.372
you being such a bookworm.

01:05:41.546 --> 01:05:43.678
- Why don't you just back off.
- I just want to thank her.

01:05:44.592 --> 01:05:46.159
For what?

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.553
For 40 years, I've been waiting
to say these words.

01:05:49.728 --> 01:05:52.861
The Ghostbusters are finished.

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.863
Your firehouse
has been condemned.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.430
Your packs are
in a police lockup.

01:05:56.604 --> 01:05:58.258
They'll be melted down
for scrap by morning.

01:05:58.432 --> 01:06:00.565
And just wait until
I get ahold of your car.

01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:02.001
Now, just hold on here...

01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.437
The last time you tried
to shut us down,

01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:05.744
you created a crossrip
into another dimension.

01:06:05.918 --> 01:06:06.919
Watch out, kiddo.

01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:08.921
That sounds a lot like slander.

01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:11.924
That's a crime punishable
with time in prison.

01:06:12.098 --> 01:06:14.057
So let me ask you,
Miss Spengler,

01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:16.059
are you going to behave,

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.062
or do I need
to have you arrested?

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:36.296
Well, we really thought
you were gonna choose "behave."

01:06:37.471 --> 01:06:38.690
Sure, I get it. You're upset.

01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:40.039
Can we just get to the part

01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:41.388
where you ground me
and move on?

01:06:41.562 --> 01:06:43.303
Oh, you're not grounded.
You're fired.

01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:47.264
Honestly,
if you weren't a Spengler,

01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:49.005
you'd be answering our phones.

01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:51.703
- Excuse me?
- Don't talk to her like that.

01:06:52.573 --> 01:06:53.531
Are you serious?

01:06:53.705 --> 01:06:55.054
I'm very serious.

01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:56.969
She's your mom.

01:06:57.143 --> 01:06:58.710
Being a Spengler
doesn't make you a genius.

01:06:58.884 --> 01:07:00.146
It just makes you
part of this family.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.669
Are you even a part
of this family?

01:07:01.843 --> 01:07:03.410
- Phoebe.
- It's...

01:07:04.368 --> 01:07:07.197
Yeah. I get it. Fair enough.

01:07:07.371 --> 01:07:08.981
But maybe if you weren't
being so selfish,

01:07:09.155 --> 01:07:10.548
you might notice that your mom,

01:07:10.722 --> 01:07:12.289
your brother and I
have been doing everything

01:07:12.463 --> 01:07:15.248
to try and protect you,
so wake up!

01:07:22.516 --> 01:07:24.344
Sucks, doesn't it?

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:25.911
WINSTON [VOICE-OVER]: What the
hell were you thinking?

01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:27.521
You don't get it.
There was a wax cylinder.

01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:29.045
- There was chanting.
- You do realize what kind

01:07:29.219 --> 01:07:30.611
of trouble you've gotten
yourself into today?

01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:31.395
The gramophone handle
was turning by its...

01:07:31.569 --> 01:07:32.178
Ray, shut up!

01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:34.267
Shut up. Ray.

01:07:35.442 --> 01:07:36.400
Geez.

01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:38.532
We're too old for this.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.535
Zedd, I...

01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:43.798
I don't know what our age
has to do with this.

01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:45.539
There was, uh, chanting
coming out of that cylinder.

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:47.454
- Ray.
- It's a trigger.

01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:50.066
- It's a catalyst. It's a key.
- You could've got yourself hurt.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.156
You could've got
those kids hurt.

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:56.115
Geez, Ray.

01:07:56.855 --> 01:07:58.074
Take a vacation, okay?

01:07:58.248 --> 01:07:59.727
Go visit some old ruins
or something.

01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:01.338
I don't know, sit your ass
on a beach somewhere.

01:08:01.512 --> 01:08:03.340
A little color
wouldn't kill you.

01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:08.519
Ray, this is supposed to be
our golden years.

01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:11.174
Winston...

01:08:11.348 --> 01:08:14.612
this is the way I want
to spend my golden years.

01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:17.571
This is what I love.

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:20.313
I know. I know.

01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:22.576
Me, too.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.710
But you need to find a new way
to do the things you love

01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:27.364
before it kills you.

01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:43.728
Pheebs.

01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:53.781
Oh, man.

01:08:56.828 --> 01:08:58.395
They stole our gear.

01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:02.007
"Civil forfeiture," I believe,
is the terminology.

01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:04.879
- Stop it! Fire pole?
-Oh, yeah.

01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:05.924
You really got to try
that thing, dude.

01:09:06.098 --> 01:09:07.404
Who is he?

01:09:07.578 --> 01:09:09.145
Oh, I'm Nadeem.
I'm a potential deep well

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:12.148
of psychokinetic energy
and quite possibly possessed.

01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:13.758
Can I try the fire pole?

01:09:14.976 --> 01:09:16.761
Yeah. Knock your socks off.

01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:20.765
Is this the last night
in the firehouse?

01:09:22.201 --> 01:09:23.376
I don't know.

01:09:28.903 --> 01:09:29.948
Hey.

01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:32.951
So this is it, huh?

01:09:34.648 --> 01:09:37.216
I'm used to being on the move.
I'm good at it.

01:09:39.871 --> 01:09:40.828
I don't know.

01:09:41.873 --> 01:09:45.050
I'd kind of like to stay
and fight for this place.

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:46.399
It's not our place.

01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:48.184
Of course it is.

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:50.664
We can't leave.

01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:52.884
I mean...

01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:57.932
If there's something strange
in the neighborhood...

01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:01.806
...who are they gonna call?

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.810
If there's something weird
and it don't look good...

01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:10.206
- ...who-who you gonna call?
- Ghostbusters.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.164
What? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what was that?

01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:14.514
- Ghostbusters.
- Ghostbusters.

01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:17.648
This is the home
of the Ghostbusters.

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:19.780
We're the Ghostbusters.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.219
Can I tell you something else?

01:10:23.828 --> 01:10:24.785
It's important.

01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:26.439
What?

01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:29.007
- Busting makes me feel good.
- No.

01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:30.965
- No. Get out.
- It makes...

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.494
Holy crap!
This place is trashed.

01:10:37.668 --> 01:10:39.496
I'm trying to get
a reading in here, please.

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:41.193
- What happened here?
- Okay, look...

01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:43.064
Such a disaster.
What have you done?

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.805
This is a very sensitive area.

01:10:44.979 --> 01:10:46.372
Oh, it is freezing.

01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:48.069
Yeah, well,
maybe it wouldn't be freezing

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.767
if a certain someone
had left his grandmother's orb

01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.247
in her room where it belongs.

01:10:51.943 --> 01:10:53.553
Wait, I'm confused.

01:10:53.727 --> 01:10:56.034
You're saying this is my fault?

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.644
Here's the deal.

01:10:57.818 --> 01:10:59.951
Your grandmother was
guardian of the orb,

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:02.867
the last line of defense
against Garraka.

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:04.347
Now it's your turn.

01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:06.218
You are the Firemaster.

01:11:06.392 --> 01:11:08.264
Ooh, that's dramatic.
I like that.

01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:10.048
It's not a joke, man.

01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:11.441
For thousands of years,
your family

01:11:11.615 --> 01:11:13.138
has selflessly guarded
the world

01:11:13.312 --> 01:11:15.053
from an unimaginable evil.

01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:16.750
Now, either she didn't
tell you about it

01:11:16.924 --> 01:11:19.013
- or you weren't listening.
- Could've been either.

01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:20.928
We had
a complicated relationship.

01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:22.800
Instead, you come into my shop,

01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:25.324
try to sell your heritage--
your birthright-- for 50 bucks.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:27.152
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:11:27.326 --> 01:11:28.414
Who are you? Who's that?

01:11:28.588 --> 01:11:30.503
You are the Firemaster.

01:11:31.635 --> 01:11:33.811
It's time for you
to claim your destiny, son.

01:11:43.211 --> 01:11:44.430
Light the candle.

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:47.041
I think we both know
that's impossible.

01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:50.523
Son, I stopped believing
in that word a long time ago.

01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:52.830
What if you were
humanity's last hope?

01:11:53.004 --> 01:11:54.875
Dude, I've never been
anyone's only hope.

01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:57.530
I went to senior prom as
a backup for someone's brother.

01:11:57.704 --> 01:11:59.271
You may not choose
to believe it,

01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:01.055
but there are many stories
of people

01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:04.232
with inexplicable gifts,
going back eons.

01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:07.235
The strength of Samson,
the speed of Achilles.

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:09.977
Perfect pitch, sick dance moves.

01:12:10.151 --> 01:12:11.501
Even pyrokinesis.

01:12:12.066 --> 01:12:13.067
So...

01:12:14.155 --> 01:12:15.418
light the candle.

01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:18.551
Light the candle?

01:12:19.247 --> 01:12:20.597
Just like that?

01:12:20.771 --> 01:12:22.425
I just do that...

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.039
What?

01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:40.312
Oh.

01:12:40.486 --> 01:12:43.228
Indus literature speaks
of a sacred fire,

01:12:43.402 --> 01:12:44.534
a smokeless flame,

01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:46.623
like the kind Moses saw
on Mount Horeb

01:12:46.797 --> 01:12:48.712
when he encountered
the burning bush.

01:12:48.886 --> 01:12:50.931
Like the kind the demon djinn
brought forth

01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:52.455
from the seven earths,

01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:54.370
that flowed through the hair
of Sambo-Kojin,

01:12:54.544 --> 01:12:56.459
the Japanese god of the hearth.

01:12:56.633 --> 01:13:00.376
That same sacred power exists
in your fingertips.

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:02.900
Wow.

01:13:04.075 --> 01:13:05.119
Oh.

01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:08.384
Light the candle.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:12.388
It's his first time.

01:13:12.562 --> 01:13:14.651
I think we're all going to die.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:22.180
Phoebe?

01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:25.488
Um, can I come in?

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:31.798
I just wanted to talk to you

01:13:31.972 --> 01:13:33.583
about what happened
at the police station.

01:13:34.627 --> 01:13:37.456
Uh, because I-I know
that was rough.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.198
And, um...

01:13:40.372 --> 01:13:41.634
but, you know, you know,
life is rough.

01:13:41.808 --> 01:13:44.637
L-Life is unpredictable
and crazy and...

01:13:47.597 --> 01:13:50.513
Doors close. Friends change.

01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:55.648
But, uh... but family is...

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:59.173
...is the one thing
that's there no matter what.

01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:03.526
You know, uh...

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.876
Sometimes they're not even
your actual blood relatives.

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:07.051
They're just...

01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:09.967
They're the people
that remind you

01:14:10.141 --> 01:14:11.229
you have a home.

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:18.541
Anyway, I think you're great.

01:14:21.326 --> 01:14:22.675
I think you're really great.

01:14:25.722 --> 01:14:27.245
I'm really glad
we had this talk.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.075
I don't know, every time I do
what I think is right,

01:14:31.249 --> 01:14:34.470
they just come down on me like
I'm screwing everything up.

01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:36.254
- That's ridiculous.
- I know.

01:14:39.953 --> 01:14:41.564
What?

01:14:41.738 --> 01:14:44.175
Just sucks that the only person
who gets me is...

01:14:45.263 --> 01:14:47.091
a ghost.

01:14:47.265 --> 01:14:50.616
Yeah. It's too bad we exist on
different dimensional planes.

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:53.227
Separated by quantum physics.

01:14:53.401 --> 01:14:54.881
It's always something.

01:14:58.755 --> 01:15:03.107
I mean, there is a way for me
to be a ghost for a bit.

01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:05.675
But it's-it's experimental.

01:15:05.849 --> 01:15:07.633
And you wouldn't want
to risk it.

01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:10.767
It's not lethal.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:13.204
That's a plus.

01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:14.597
Just requires a little bit
of light breaking and entering

01:15:14.771 --> 01:15:16.468
and some advanced science.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:19.253
I mean, I wouldn't want to
get you into any more trouble.

01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:22.561
What else can they do to me?

01:15:47.151 --> 01:15:48.152
What is that thing?

01:15:48.848 --> 01:15:50.328
It's an ionic separator.

01:15:50.502 --> 01:15:51.808
It'll allow us
to temporarily exist

01:15:51.982 --> 01:15:54.114
- on the same dimensional plane.

01:15:55.507 --> 01:15:57.030
My spirit will be separated
from my body

01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:58.336
for only two minutes.

01:16:00.294 --> 01:16:01.948
Then I'll regain consciousness.

01:17:24.944 --> 01:17:25.945
Boo.

01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:32.343
What's wrong?

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:35.999
I'm sorry.

01:17:38.349 --> 01:17:39.350
For what?

01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.661
A human voice is the key.

01:17:51.144 --> 01:17:52.972
But Garraka
can't control humans.

01:17:53.146 --> 01:17:55.192
- Only ghosts.

01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:58.586
And now he can control you.

01:18:11.599 --> 01:18:14.472
Garraka's the only one that can
open the door to the other side.

01:18:18.215 --> 01:18:19.390
It's my only chance.

01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:28.660
My only chance
to see my family again.

01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:35.493
Maybe one day,
you'll understand.

01:19:15.315 --> 01:19:19.493
Your world will shatter.

01:19:20.538 --> 01:19:23.628
Bones and ice.

01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:30.548
My empire will rise.

01:19:41.037 --> 01:19:42.473
Hey, asshole.

01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:57.227
Lucky!

01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:25.385
-Phoebe?
-Over here.

01:20:25.559 --> 01:20:26.822
Phoebe. Are you okay?

01:20:26.996 --> 01:20:28.475
- She ghost-walked.
- What?

01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:30.216
Her spirit separated
from her body.

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:31.696
- Oh, my God, you're freezing.
- I tried to stop it.

01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:33.002
- I couldn't.
-No, it's okay.

01:20:33.176 --> 01:20:34.873
No, you're okay.
That's all that matters.

01:20:35.047 --> 01:20:36.353
- We're in trouble. We're...
- No, you're not in trouble.

01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:37.615
- You're not in trouble.
-She's right.

01:20:39.965 --> 01:20:41.880
We're all in big trouble.

01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:53.587
Yeah,
just give me a minute.

01:20:53.761 --> 01:20:55.633
Just, uh, finishing this up.

01:20:55.807 --> 01:20:57.461
I'll be right with you.

01:20:57.635 --> 01:21:01.117
Are you the Firemaster?

01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:03.641
Yeah, man, read the damn sign.

01:22:40.216 --> 01:22:42.958
- I love that.
- What is that?

01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:27.176
Should we call this one in?

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:29.047
Yeah, call this one in.

01:23:29.221 --> 01:23:30.962
-Taxi!

01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:46.891
It's okay if you guys hate me.

01:23:47.065 --> 01:23:48.719
We don't hate you.
We were worried about you.

01:23:48.893 --> 01:23:52.331
We didn't know where you were.
You could've been killed.

01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:54.725
I trusted somebody
that I shouldn't have.

01:23:54.899 --> 01:23:57.032
I just feel stupid.

01:23:57.206 --> 01:23:58.685
It's okay to feel stupid.

01:23:58.859 --> 01:24:00.470
Some of the smartest people
I know are morons.

01:24:00.644 --> 01:24:02.907
Yeah, and I told you
to make mistakes.

01:24:03.081 --> 01:24:04.952
Yeah, not release
a monstrous deity.

01:24:05.127 --> 01:24:06.432
Maybe next time, get a tattoo.

01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:08.956
Or try shoplifting.
Hey, that'd be fun.

01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:10.523
Yeah. Okay.

01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:13.222
Hey.

01:24:13.396 --> 01:24:15.224
Are you ready
to be a Spengler again?

01:24:16.834 --> 01:24:18.575
Good, 'cause we need you.

01:24:18.749 --> 01:24:19.750
Yeah.

01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:33.633
-Phoebe.

01:24:33.807 --> 01:24:35.592
-How did Garraka get out?
-Doesn't matter.

01:24:35.766 --> 01:24:37.855
It's coming right for us,
and it's really bad out there.

01:24:38.029 --> 01:24:39.204
Wh-Who's coming right for us?

01:24:39.378 --> 01:24:41.337
Typical manifestation of evil.

01:24:41.511 --> 01:24:43.426
Ender of worlds,
that kind of thing.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.384
Garraka's coming
for the containment unit

01:24:45.558 --> 01:24:47.995
to recruit every ghost
in the tank we've ever caught.

01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.867
We can't allow that to happen.

01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:51.782
He'll have a veritable
army of ghosts.

01:24:51.956 --> 01:24:54.176
Army of ghosts?
- Guys, it's okay. We're fine.

01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:56.178
Look, we're good. Calm down.

01:24:56.352 --> 01:24:58.615
We have the Firemaster.

01:25:00.182 --> 01:25:01.618
Do the thing.

01:25:01.792 --> 01:25:03.098
This is really great.
You're gonna love it.

01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:07.189
Okay,
just like we practiced.

01:25:15.632 --> 01:25:16.676
Huh?

01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:18.374
- Huh?
- Yes!

01:25:21.377 --> 01:25:22.508
- Great.
-Huh?

01:25:22.682 --> 01:25:24.162
Great.

01:25:27.948 --> 01:25:29.385
Where are our proton packs?

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.781
New packs.

01:25:42.441 --> 01:25:43.442
Suit up.

01:25:44.095 --> 01:25:45.488
Get to the roof, all right?

01:25:45.662 --> 01:25:48.360
Just shoot anything
that looks terrifying.

01:25:48.534 --> 01:25:50.232
But I already threw
a proton stream at that thing.

01:25:50.406 --> 01:25:52.451
- It didn't even flinch.
- How is that possible?

01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:54.410
It's an ancient god
from another dimension.

01:25:54.584 --> 01:25:56.629
Who's to know
its atomic composition?

01:25:58.849 --> 01:26:00.155
- Dr. Ray?
- Yeah?

01:26:00.329 --> 01:26:01.765
Copper can conduct
an electrical field

01:26:01.939 --> 01:26:03.593
like the one in our colliders.

01:26:03.767 --> 01:26:05.856
Yeah, but there's no copper
left in the firehouse.

01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:08.467
Stripped by vagrants
in the '90s.

01:26:09.425 --> 01:26:11.427
Well, then what about brass?

01:26:12.602 --> 01:26:14.430
Brass.

01:26:14.604 --> 01:26:16.867
Especially if it's
psychically charged.

01:26:25.702 --> 01:26:27.356
PHOEBE [VOICE-OVER]: Our proton
packs use nickel and zinc

01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:29.967
as primary drivers
for spectral agitation.

01:26:31.447 --> 01:26:33.275
But Garraka is different.

01:26:34.624 --> 01:26:37.627
The ancient ghost trappers
used brass to trap him.

01:26:42.284 --> 01:26:44.373
If I brass-plate
the components of my pack,

01:26:44.547 --> 01:26:47.289
it could give us a chance.

01:27:01.955 --> 01:27:02.826
Switch me on.

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:15.360
Wow, he managed
a faster decay of split time

01:27:15.534 --> 01:27:17.884
and narrowed
the stream intensification.

01:27:18.058 --> 01:27:19.408
Terrific new improvements.

01:27:22.062 --> 01:27:22.976
Let's get to work.

01:27:56.314 --> 01:27:57.533
Here we go.

01:28:10.067 --> 01:28:12.199
- Can I be of any help?
-Son of a bitch.

01:28:12.374 --> 01:28:14.724
- Venkman.
- You got to be kidding me.

01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:16.378
Home sweet home.

01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:20.077
Melnitz in uniform.

01:28:20.251 --> 01:28:21.948
Looking sporty.

01:28:23.863 --> 01:28:25.865
Oh.

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:28.868
Courage, anyone?

01:28:42.273 --> 01:28:43.143
-No, no, no, no, no,

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:44.754
I don't like that.

01:28:44.928 --> 01:28:46.277
- What do you see up there?
-A trike.

01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:47.800
- Tell them it's a trike.
- A what?

01:28:47.974 --> 01:28:50.455
A kid's tricycle
rolling down the street

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:51.935
- on its own.
- No, no. Possessor.

01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:54.111
- Possessor.
- You need to get down here now.

01:28:54.285 --> 01:28:55.199
Yeah.

01:29:05.427 --> 01:29:06.297
- What's going on?

01:29:06.471 --> 01:29:07.820
Oh, it's really bad.

01:29:07.994 --> 01:29:09.213
The world's ending.
Do not go up there.

01:29:09.387 --> 01:29:10.693
- How's it going?
- Oh, terrible.

01:29:10.867 --> 01:29:12.782
Okay,
just keep practicing, man.

01:29:12.956 --> 01:29:14.740
We got your back.

01:29:14.914 --> 01:29:17.134
Could one of the adults
also come and help?

01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:33.803
-Whoa!

01:29:52.909 --> 01:29:53.823
It's possessed!

01:29:53.997 --> 01:29:55.172
- Run!

01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:59.829
-Whoa!

01:30:35.952 --> 01:30:38.955
- Oh, my God.

01:30:44.482 --> 01:30:46.310
Oh.

01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:47.920
Gave me the fright of my life.

01:30:48.094 --> 01:30:49.661
I thought you were
one of the big, scary ones.

01:30:56.581 --> 01:30:57.974
How'd you get
all the way up here?

01:31:02.544 --> 01:31:04.937
Ooh, paper.

01:31:06.025 --> 01:31:07.026
That's random.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.115
Lucky!

01:31:09.289 --> 01:31:11.553
- Lucky, are you okay?

01:31:14.381 --> 01:31:15.905
Oh, shit.

01:31:18.864 --> 01:31:19.865
Trevor!

01:31:40.233 --> 01:31:41.757
You're doing it!

01:31:41.931 --> 01:31:43.062
This is awesome!

01:32:00.689 --> 01:32:02.168
I know that guy!

01:32:05.389 --> 01:32:06.782
I am a god.

01:32:07.565 --> 01:32:08.479
Where's Phoebe?

01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:22.058
Good luck.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:43.035
So, was any of it real?

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:47.257
Yeah. I actually did
beat you at chess.

01:32:56.353 --> 01:32:57.572
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:32:57.746 --> 01:33:00.139
I just wanted
to see my family again.

01:33:00.313 --> 01:33:01.750
Well, my family's up there now.

01:33:02.968 --> 01:33:04.840
We still have time
to stop this.

01:33:06.015 --> 01:33:07.016
It's too late.

01:33:10.672 --> 01:33:11.847
He's here.

01:33:30.474 --> 01:33:32.781
Phoebe? Phoebe!

01:33:43.052 --> 01:33:44.270
Heads up.

01:33:44.444 --> 01:33:46.272
Tall, dark and horny
at 12 o'clock.

01:33:52.322 --> 01:33:53.715
Ah!

01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:15.519
Garraka can't help you move on.

01:34:15.693 --> 01:34:17.173
You have to do that yourself.

01:34:26.573 --> 01:34:28.271
Don't let him get
to the basement!

01:34:28.445 --> 01:34:29.446
How?

01:34:30.621 --> 01:34:32.188
Well, being nice didn't work.

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:38.194
- Let's try this.
- Light 'em up!

01:34:42.459 --> 01:34:45.810
I tried to tell you guys
our throwers are useless.

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.477
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

01:35:04.611 --> 01:35:05.874
Okay.

01:35:07.789 --> 01:35:09.312
Look, dude, I'm...

01:35:09.486 --> 01:35:11.444
I'm probably
your worst nightmare.

01:35:12.968 --> 01:35:14.056
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:35:14.970 --> 01:35:18.538
Real talk, man to... whatever.

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:20.018
I don't want to hurt you.

01:35:20.192 --> 01:35:21.585
Okay? So, how about
we call this even,

01:35:21.759 --> 01:35:23.108
we each go our separate ways.

01:35:23.282 --> 01:35:26.111
I go back to Queens,
you go back to Narnia.

01:35:36.687 --> 01:35:41.300
You are no Firemaster.

01:35:42.954 --> 01:35:46.262
Me? No, I'm not the Firemaster.

01:35:46.436 --> 01:35:48.786
I'm just Nadeem.

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.963
And let the record show
I gave you a chance.

01:35:57.882 --> 01:35:59.710
Dude, did you use
all the lighter fluid?

01:35:59.884 --> 01:36:01.407
You told me to practice.

01:36:03.105 --> 01:36:05.455
Um, does anyone have a light?

01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:07.544
I-I quit smoking in the '90s.

01:36:07.718 --> 01:36:09.546
Proud of you then,
proud of you now.

01:36:11.156 --> 01:36:13.202
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

01:36:14.507 --> 01:36:15.552
Uh...

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:25.301
- Get out of the way!

01:36:25.475 --> 01:36:27.520
- Move!

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:30.045
Look out!

01:36:53.329 --> 01:36:54.330
Bye, Phoebe.

01:39:55.772 --> 01:39:57.469
-Phoebe!

01:40:13.355 --> 01:40:15.226
They're pinning him!
We can trap him now!

01:40:43.602 --> 01:40:45.300
No!

01:40:45.474 --> 01:40:47.171
We're gonna need a bigger trap.

01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:49.173
It's right there.

01:40:49.347 --> 01:40:50.435
Garraka's let
all the spirits out.

01:40:50.609 --> 01:40:51.697
Peter, do you know
what this means?

01:40:51.871 --> 01:40:53.482
You know what we could do?

01:40:53.656 --> 01:40:54.744
Ray, pretend I don't.

01:40:59.575 --> 01:41:02.186
If we neutralize
the mass-energy d-density

01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:04.971
to reduce criticality,
it will force the tank

01:41:05.146 --> 01:41:06.190
to re-prime itself
and re-reverse the polar...

01:41:06.364 --> 01:41:08.801
Just do it! We all trust you.

01:41:17.288 --> 01:41:18.855
I can't hold him much longer!

01:41:19.029 --> 01:41:21.249
-Come on!
- Hey, little help.

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:39.005
Golden years?

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.659
Golden years!

01:42:12.517 --> 01:42:14.563
When the light is green...

01:42:14.737 --> 01:42:16.304
The whole world is clean.

01:42:18.262 --> 01:42:20.917
I knew you had
one more dance in you.

01:42:24.616 --> 01:42:27.184
Yes!

01:42:27.358 --> 01:42:28.925
You're toast.

01:42:50.033 --> 01:42:51.252
You were right.

01:42:53.776 --> 01:42:56.431
I'll see you in the fabric
of the universe.

01:43:30.639 --> 01:43:31.814
Mom.

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:52.182
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

01:43:52.356 --> 01:43:54.010
- Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

01:43:54.184 --> 01:43:57.361
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

01:43:57.535 --> 01:43:59.189
- Hey!
- Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

01:43:59.363 --> 01:44:02.497
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

01:44:02.671 --> 01:44:04.368
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

01:44:04.542 --> 01:44:05.978
- Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:15.423
You have done it!

01:44:16.337 --> 01:44:18.208
Citywide devastation.

01:44:18.382 --> 01:44:20.602
I am putting you away
for a long ti...

01:44:20.776 --> 01:44:22.256
Peck.

01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:24.170
You clown.

01:44:24.345 --> 01:44:25.302
You're never gonna
get it, are you?

01:44:25.476 --> 01:44:26.825
Mr. Mayor!

01:44:26.999 --> 01:44:28.479
What do you have to say
to the Ghostbusters?

01:44:28.653 --> 01:44:30.264
Hey, how about
you thank them, dickless!

01:44:30.438 --> 01:44:32.222
Wh-What... Uh, yes.

01:44:32.396 --> 01:44:34.398
It sounds like we have
your undivided support.

01:44:34.572 --> 01:44:35.965
Love you, Ghostbusters!

01:44:36.139 --> 01:44:38.228
Uh, w-well, y-yes, of course.

01:44:38.402 --> 01:44:40.056
Good. I'm so happy
to hear that, Mr. Mayor,

01:44:40.230 --> 01:44:43.146
because without Phoebe
and her family, this whole city

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.930
would be under
three feet of ice.

01:44:45.104 --> 01:44:46.497
- Yeah.

01:44:46.671 --> 01:44:51.720
We know that
the world right now

01:44:51.894 --> 01:44:55.985
is experiencing
unusual paranormal activity.

01:44:56.159 --> 01:44:58.379
We are here to answer that call

01:44:58.553 --> 01:45:01.469
because we are
the Ghostbusters!

01:45:06.778 --> 01:45:09.694
Well, it's not
my first evil god.

01:45:09.868 --> 01:45:11.087
I am Nadeem.

01:45:11.261 --> 01:45:14.482
I am a Firemaster, turns out.

01:45:14.656 --> 01:45:16.353
