WEBVTT

01:02.020 --> 01:06.024
THE GLORY

01:39.390 --> 01:40.975
You're Mr. Ha, right?

01:43.061 --> 01:44.312
Yes. It's been a while.

01:45.563 --> 01:48.274
Yeon-jin doesn't have
a fitting scheduled for today.

01:48.858 --> 01:49.734
I'm aware.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.529
Can I go try this on?

01:53.863 --> 01:55.198
Where's the fitting room?

02:29.107 --> 02:29.941
It's tiny.

02:31.192 --> 02:33.027
Somebody could come in whenever.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.863
But you and I are so hot.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.212
I see.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.717
You always mean what you say, Yeon-jin.

02:58.428 --> 03:03.433
THE GLORY

03:05.143 --> 03:07.604
Your neighbors say
you get beaten up all the time.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.023
I was expecting much worse.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.111
At Dong-eun's apartment,
I saw all sorts of pictures there.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.615
Even though there were tons,
I knew everyone in them.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.455
But I didn't know
this gentleman right here.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.082
You have nothing to say?

03:29.584 --> 03:32.879
How... How did you even find me?

03:33.755 --> 03:34.589
It wasn't hard.

03:35.089 --> 03:38.885
EDEN APARTMENTS

03:48.436 --> 03:51.022
- CHIEF SHIN YEONG-JUN
- VEHICLE REGISTRATION

03:51.022 --> 03:53.858
<i>I didn't think of this before,
but I just found out.</i>

03:53.858 --> 03:55.777
<i>Moon Dong-eun owns two vehicles.</i>

03:55.777 --> 03:58.112
<i>She drives the one ending in 4-2-2-5.</i>

03:58.112 --> 04:00.406
<i>I'll let you know when I find out
who's driving the other.</i>

04:08.039 --> 04:09.707
No way she took all those.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.009
Hey, it's me.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.553
That bitch is getting help from someone.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.349
I have an idea on how to find out
who's driving the other car, yeah.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.810
Assign someone to me, starting tomorrow.

04:29.936 --> 04:34.274
I guess you found me
because I was working too hard.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.110
You sound crazy right now.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.281
You have no idea how much I know.
Want to try me?

04:45.910 --> 04:48.496
Just say it already.
Tell me what you want.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.835
If you happen to breathe
a single word of this to my husband,

04:54.794 --> 04:55.795
I'll make you regret it.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.298
How would you do that?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.259
Nobody can try to stop me.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.430
I'm more than happy
to talk to your husband, too.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.351
Oh my god, just shut it.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.562
Listen.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.233
I'm going to say something
you'll find interesting.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.194
Lee Sun-a.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.949
Semyeong Middle School.
First year, class three.

05:28.953 --> 05:29.787
What?

05:30.872 --> 05:32.915
You're allowed to take
pictures of my daughter,

05:32.915 --> 05:34.834
but I can't do research on yours?

05:37.128 --> 05:41.007
You can go to my daughter's school,
but I can't say your daughter's name?

05:41.924 --> 05:44.427
Maybe this conversation can get somewhere

05:44.427 --> 05:46.137
if I drag your daughter here.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.931
I'm so sorry. I am so sorry, ma'am.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.517
Just, please, not my daughter. Not her.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.227
Please!

05:53.227 --> 05:54.729
Do you understand me now?

05:55.938 --> 05:58.066
You should've had
a different attitude, no?

05:58.816 --> 06:00.401
I'm a lot tougher than you are.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.623
I'm calling you,
so make sure you save my number.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.556
Looks like you have it already.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.308
BITCH WHO'LL END UP IN A DITCH

06:37.271 --> 06:38.106
Pick up.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.700
It's a bit weird, isn't it?

06:50.868 --> 06:54.205
An elementary teacher. An ex-maid.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.291
What could they have in common?

07:00.002 --> 07:02.255
Ah, I get it now.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.551
You want to kill somebody, I guess.
That man?

07:07.927 --> 07:10.638
Dong-eun wants to kill someone. Me.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.854
I'm right. You both have
someone you want to kill.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.694
Then let me offer you the deal she made.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.864
Help me. I'll kill your husband.

07:29.198 --> 07:32.034
I can have him killed
faster than Dong-eun ever could.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.037
I could kill him tomorrow.
You could bury him the next day.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.415
Or maybe I could pay you instead.

07:38.916 --> 07:43.421
But you'll have to do
whatever I tell you, yeah?

07:45.423 --> 07:46.466
What do you say?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.840
Mom, what's wrong? Where are we going?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.842
Hurry up. Your dad will be up soon.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.469
Come on, run!

08:36.098 --> 08:38.518
Get in quick. We don't have time.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.066
- Whose car is this?
- Seatbelt.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.318
Don't roll down your windows, understand?

08:47.318 --> 08:49.237
Wait, Mom, you can drive?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.005
You're warm enough, right?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.841
Just sleep. I'll wake you when I stop.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.178
Where are we going?

09:14.178 --> 09:15.596
I don't know right now.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.516
But I do know we're going to keep driving.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.017
Why?

09:20.017 --> 09:23.688
Someone might be following the two of us.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.693
We'll come back to Semyeong
tomorrow or the day after.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.027
Why?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.363
At that point, I should have lost them,

09:32.905 --> 09:34.740
and I'll know where to go next.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.159
But for now, don't ask anything.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.829
Please just do what I tell you, huh?

09:41.414 --> 09:44.792
Wow, Mom, you're so freaking cool!
This is awesome.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.295
I'm going to put on some music.
This one's my favorite.

10:07.648 --> 10:11.986
<i>I'm sorry, but the person
you're trying to reach is not available.</i>

10:11.986 --> 10:13.988
MS. KANG

10:15.740 --> 10:17.158
What are you doing after work?

10:18.451 --> 10:19.952
I'm meeting up with somebody.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.832
Really? But there's
a faculty meeting today.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.917
Regarding the schoolwide field trip.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.586
That's today?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.838
No one told me anything about it.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.257
Well, it just got scheduled.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.968
See you there at 5:00.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.602
We'll need to organize
everything needed for all the festivals

10:44.602 --> 10:46.604
that are taking place
over the next two months.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.441
Um, and the bus company we usually use,
we'll need to find another company.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.318
We'll need to reference
what we did last year

10:52.318 --> 10:55.696
and print out all the field trip records
from the other grades and compare them.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.782
But last year's records won't be enough.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.578
We'll need records from the past 5 years
to really see what's going on.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.122
Well, it'll give us more information.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.833
Got that, Ms. Moon?

11:08.584 --> 11:10.920
You can take on this project, can't you?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.006
All on my own?

11:17.385 --> 11:18.928
That's what we agreed on.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.013
Speak up now if you object.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.104
I have no problem with it.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.231
I'll do it.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.066
That's what I thought.

11:32.733 --> 11:33.651
Thank you.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.279
HA YE-SOL

11:37.279 --> 11:39.281
Should I set it down in here?

11:39.281 --> 11:41.659
Uh, right there. Over to the left.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.788
This is their most expensive one?

11:45.788 --> 11:47.081
Of course.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.916
Imported straight from Italy!

11:48.916 --> 11:51.585
- Probably costs as much as a used car.
- Uh-huh.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.003
How old is your kid?

11:54.922 --> 11:56.924
- She's eight now.
- I bet she's very cute.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.761
You know, you don't see many people
who have kids with dogs nowadays.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.179
Why?

12:02.179 --> 12:05.725
I mean, animals with fur
usually shed a lot,

12:05.725 --> 12:08.519
and that can give kids
asthma or something.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.857
Uh, excuse me, I should get back to work.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.325
What do you want?
And you better make this quick.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.036
I'm a little busy. Like, seriously.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.957
You'll receive an address soon.
You need to lure Yeon-jin there.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.041
That's all I need for now.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.003
-<i>I'm hanging up.</i>
- Just hold on a second.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.506
That was a lot faster than I thought.
At least tell me why.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.468
Exactly how am I supposed
to get her there?

12:40.468 --> 12:42.762
We just had a huge fight.
She probably won't even pick up.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.431
That's for you to figure out.

12:46.223 --> 12:49.727
Your dress looked pretty. Next week's
your wedding photoshoot, right?

12:52.688 --> 12:55.649
Did my mother-in-law
tell you about my photoshoot?

12:56.233 --> 13:00.070
Get busy before we start
discussing other things, Hye-jeong.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.038
CHOI HYE-JEONG

13:14.210 --> 13:17.338
Ms. Moon, you might want to run down
to the parking lot as soon as you can.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.262
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.681
Excuse me... but who are you?

13:27.681 --> 13:29.391
No, this... this isn't it.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.268
- Hey!
- I'm looking for someone!

13:35.731 --> 13:37.441
That little shit.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.402
Hey, what's wrong with you?

13:41.111 --> 13:42.363
You can't be here.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.365
- You need to go.
- I swear, this bitch...

13:44.365 --> 13:47.409
Hey, get off of me! What?! Oh my God!

13:47.409 --> 13:48.494
Where is she now?

13:52.414 --> 13:53.958
Ah, she's here.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.334
My baby!

13:56.752 --> 13:58.963
It's Ma!

13:58.963 --> 14:01.674
How've you been?

14:06.971 --> 14:09.306
Excuse me. There's somebody here for you.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.059
It's nice to see you, ma'am.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.228
I'm a friend of Dong-eun's.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.772
You've lost contact with her, haven't you?

14:35.457 --> 14:36.709
You're saying

14:37.626 --> 14:39.795
Dong-eun is working at some school now?

14:40.421 --> 14:42.840
As what? A janitor?

14:45.801 --> 14:46.719
A lunch lady?

14:47.636 --> 14:49.471
So it seems like you don't know.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.056
Dong-eun's teaching at that school.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.561
Teaching?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.272
A public...

15:00.149 --> 15:02.026
Uh, Dong-eun's a public servant?

15:02.026 --> 15:04.570
Well, it's a private school, so not quite.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.614
Anyway, ma'am,

15:06.614 --> 15:10.367
could you please get Dong-eun
fired from her school for me?

15:14.955 --> 15:16.749
You're some crazy bitch, huh?

15:18.542 --> 15:19.543
Who are you?

15:20.753 --> 15:23.505
Why would I get her fired
from something that pays so well?

15:23.505 --> 15:26.425
It's not like you would get
any of that money.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.345
You haven't spoken to her
in over a decade.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.976
I'll give you more
than Dong-eun could ever have.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.020
Shit.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.521
Hey.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.900
Who the hell are you, huh?

15:42.900 --> 15:45.736
Oh, I forgot that we've never met.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.989
But I know you've met my mother before.
Dong-eun's withdrawal?

15:48.989 --> 15:51.283
You signed? Don't you remember?

15:52.910 --> 15:55.746
- Ah.
- You received a check back then, right?

16:00.542 --> 16:04.171
You just need to get her kicked out.
It's a pretty similar situation.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.926
Take this now, for the taxi ride there.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.345
And this for the ride back.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.263
Make sure she signs her resignation,

16:14.181 --> 16:16.684
and then you can
come get the rest of your money.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.693
Where does she teach, then?

16:27.569 --> 16:29.113
It wouldn't be in Semyeong, would it?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.032
How'd you know?

16:33.450 --> 16:35.577
<i>Open this door!</i>

16:40.541 --> 16:42.084
You're in there, right?

16:43.711 --> 16:46.755
It's you. I looked up where you live now.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.341
I know that's you in there, honey.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.219
Open! Open this door, right now!

16:53.595 --> 16:55.723
Stop that! What are you doing to my door?

17:00.728 --> 17:03.313
There's a... a woman living here?

17:04.273 --> 17:05.357
Moon Dong-eun, right?

17:06.442 --> 17:09.111
- She's my daughter.
- There's nobody's living in there.

17:10.654 --> 17:14.700
I went all the way to the county office,
and they said she lives here.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.578
So don't lie to me!

17:18.370 --> 17:21.582
I know that she lives in here.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.338
You think you can try to hide from me?

17:28.338 --> 17:30.049
Open it!

17:30.049 --> 17:32.384
I don't care!
I don't care what they told you!

17:32.384 --> 17:35.137
I said nobody lives here!
Why are you destroying my building?

17:35.137 --> 17:36.889
Why would you do that? You're trespassing.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.184
What the hell are you doing?
You old bitch, are you losing it?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.810
You bet I've lost it.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.772
I own this place!
Get out of here! Get out now!

18:13.092 --> 18:15.260
Oh, honey.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.680
Just look at this.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.144
Is it monthly or long-term?

18:25.145 --> 18:26.647
You don't own it, do you?

18:28.524 --> 18:29.441
How'd you find me?

18:31.110 --> 18:34.446
Oh wow. Not even a bottle of water.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.950
I can put up some new wallpaper for you.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.829
- I know someone who can--
- I asked, how did you find me?

18:42.412 --> 18:43.872
How can you teach those kids

18:43.872 --> 18:46.250
when you treat your mother
like this, sweetie?

18:47.084 --> 18:49.878
So then, when'd you move in here?

18:52.464 --> 18:55.384
When I was here in the spring,
she said no one lived here.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.719
You came here? Last spring?

18:57.719 --> 18:59.138
Of course!

18:59.138 --> 19:01.890
I'm your mommy, right?

19:02.975 --> 19:06.061
Blood is thicker than water, you see?

19:08.564 --> 19:09.940
Go and hide if you'd like.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.025
I'll find you again.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.739
<i>You did it, Yeon-jin.</i>

19:20.284 --> 19:23.871
<i>You've found two new irons
to use against me.</i>

19:40.721 --> 19:43.515
This is my friend, Yeon-jin.
Is it okay if she stays?

19:43.515 --> 19:46.560
Yeah, can't turn away free advertising.

19:46.560 --> 19:50.063
We're doing a buy-one-get-one-free event.
Let me know if you'd like a procedure too.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.609
I believe that everything is worth
what you pay for it.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.070
- How long's it take?
- About 10, 15 minutes.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.656
Why didn't you just call me
when you were done?

19:59.656 --> 20:02.201
Go ahead. What's this about Dong-eun?

20:03.076 --> 20:05.370
I wanted you to hear this from me first.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.123
Don't freak out.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.292
'Cause this is the truth.

20:11.126 --> 20:14.630
Moon Dong-eun and your husband
have been playing Go.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.258
Have they now?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.095
How could you know that?

20:23.513 --> 20:26.350
What the hell? Do you know how much that--

20:27.017 --> 20:28.143
What if you had scratched it?

20:28.143 --> 20:30.395
Oh, I'm sorry ma'am. I am so sorry.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.481
You can leave it. Just go do your job.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.237
Why buy a bag that's out of your league?

20:38.237 --> 20:41.365
Just use a tote.
Now finish what you were saying.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.700
You don't have the right to say it's fine.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.830
What? You think I stole this
from a customer at the laundromat?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.290
Well, I didn't.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.876
A rich man gave it to me as a present.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.421
Don't take it the wrong way.
I'm just saying it'd be a bit more green.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.633
There's still a bit left.
Would you like some privacy?

20:59.633 --> 21:03.303
Oh, it's fine. I'm going.
She just seems a little bit touchy today.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.890
You know, you're right.
I just got my period.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.185
That's why I didn't
sleep with your husband the other night.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.187
He was so disappointed.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.691
What are you even talking about?

21:18.860 --> 21:22.114
The man who bought me this
was your husband, Yeon-jin.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.242
It was your husband
who told me he plays Go with Dong-eun.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.577
It's a small fucking world, right?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.249
Did you meet up with Do-yeong? I mean...

21:35.085 --> 21:36.712
Did Do-yeong go out of his way
to meet you?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.964
Yeah, and he brought this with him too.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.718
I should have told him
everything about you.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.636
'Cause we're friends, I stopped myself.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.475
Please add my free procedure
to my account, Dr. Joo.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.102
I'll come back another time.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.320
Maybe you should book an appointment too,

22:02.029 --> 22:04.072
so your husband won't have to call me.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.879
My husband sure has standards.
It was an Hermès bag, I mean.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.172
Would you like a procedure too?

22:21.590 --> 22:24.509
People usually end up returning
after seeing my work.

22:24.509 --> 22:28.305
Semyeong housewives
are probably most of your clients.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.558
I'll think about it
when it's going to rain.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.354
You can come for your filler
if you don't have an umbrella.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.857
It won't rain for a while, though.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.817
See you later.

22:51.995 --> 22:56.124
Come on, hurry up. Get in there.
Come on, stop stalling. Get in there!

22:56.958 --> 22:58.085
Come on, inside.

23:14.434 --> 23:18.438
Mr. Park, your team raided
a gambling den earlier today, right?

23:21.483 --> 23:23.985
I said to never gamble again.
Didn't I say that?

23:25.278 --> 23:26.446
You went to a gambling den?

23:27.489 --> 23:28.782
Where did that money come from?

23:31.660 --> 23:34.663
If I have to ask him and he gives me
that same bullshit story,

23:34.663 --> 23:36.373
I'm going to kill you.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.050
So then, there was a car accident,

23:48.301 --> 23:49.594
and you extorted money from her?

23:49.594 --> 23:53.181
I mean, people normally do that
for any accident. It's only natural.

23:56.309 --> 23:59.271
They say if you hire smart people,
they'll backstab you,

23:59.271 --> 24:02.315
and that dumbasses like you
just screw up for me!

24:03.024 --> 24:07.279
I'm the reason you get to work, assholes,
And this is how you pay me back?

24:07.904 --> 24:10.073
This is the reason
I can never leave the force.

24:10.073 --> 24:13.660
I can't when you morons are
screwing up my business! Fucking bitch!

24:13.660 --> 24:16.329
- Give it.
- Stop it! Get out of here!

24:16.329 --> 24:19.499
No more! Does this look like
some sort of charity? Huh?

24:20.208 --> 24:23.128
I've only been putting up with you
this long because of your wife!

24:23.128 --> 24:25.130
- Get out!
- Hey, shit.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.467
I told you you'll get your money
when my bitch wife comes back.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.719
That's what you said yesterday,
and the day before that!

24:30.719 --> 24:32.888
Don't come back
unless you're with your wife.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.849
If I were her,
I wouldn't come back either.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.017
Come on, stop that!

24:37.017 --> 24:39.311
- Enough!
- Ugh, you're such a fucking bitch!

24:39.311 --> 24:42.355
- My goodness.
- I'll set this fucking store on fire!

24:42.355 --> 24:45.609
- Can you ring this up?
- What're you doing, you fucking bitch?

24:45.609 --> 24:48.487
Want me to rip your eyes out?
I was in line first!

24:48.487 --> 24:50.906
Hey, now. Stop messing with my customers!

24:50.906 --> 24:52.782
Heh, I'm sorry. Let me ring you up.

24:52.782 --> 24:53.950
Just one second.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.870
- Let go!
- Stop that. Really, come on!

24:57.454 --> 24:58.830
Oh, no, no, wait...

25:00.790 --> 25:04.419
<i>Sorry I didn't come
to meet you, ma'am. Please call me soon.</i>

25:11.384 --> 25:12.886
You were exactly right, ma'am.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.055
Park Yeon-jin did find me.

25:19.142 --> 25:21.186
MS. MOON

25:21.186 --> 25:22.562
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

25:22.562 --> 25:25.607
<i>One of the photos
that went missing was your husband.</i>

25:26.942 --> 25:29.277
My... My husband? You sure?

25:29.277 --> 25:30.445
Yeah.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.782
Park Yeon-jin might have discovered
the two of us have been working together.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.997
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll call you when I can.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.582
I'm parking my car now.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.730
So then I turned off my cell phone

26:06.314 --> 26:08.149
and just started driving with Sun-a.

26:09.401 --> 26:14.781
I don't want you to misunderstand
anything that I was doing.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.075
Misunderstand?

26:18.285 --> 26:21.997
I thought you'd think

26:21.997 --> 26:24.499
I had switched sides
and was actually working for her now.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.461
You already made that mistake before.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.048
Have you had the chance to eat yet?

26:34.634 --> 26:35.468
Yeah.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.605
Please take care of my Sun-a.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.858
I need to turn my phone back on

26:50.609 --> 26:52.277
and get back on Yeon-jin's radar.

26:53.486 --> 26:56.531
Everything we've done so far
will be useless if she meets my husband.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.370
Thankfully that hasn't happened yet.
I made sure.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.502
Don't worry too much about Sun-a.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.087
Yeah.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.466
I guess I'll try to buy us some time.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.010
I'll ask for more money first.

27:20.513 --> 27:23.767
From this moment on,
Park Yeon-jin is my boss.

27:24.601 --> 27:25.685
Ms. Moon Dong-eun.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.079
You'll be staying here for the time being.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.664
I'm going to need your phone.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.249
You can only contact me and her.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.085
Just the two of us in this room.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.002
Understand?

27:53.171 --> 27:54.172
What about school?

27:55.048 --> 27:57.926
Your mother is going to pull you
out of school tomorrow.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.929
You'll be able to finish
high school in the States.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.431
Watch some American shows
to help your English.

28:03.431 --> 28:06.768
But if I disappear,
my dad is going to kill my mom.

28:07.977 --> 28:11.815
He said he'd kill my grandma and aunt
if my mom and I ever tried to run away.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.650
That will never happen.

28:13.650 --> 28:16.152
I promise you.
Just trust your mother and wait.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.197
The one thing that I know

28:19.906 --> 28:23.243
is your mother is doing
everything she can for you.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.538
The life we have can be very cruel.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.792
This is why you have to study abroad.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.545
Just go and study as hard as you can.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.841
The only way you can show anyone
how brave you are

28:39.008 --> 28:39.968
is by leaving.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.097
While you're studying,
go on a trip sometime.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.682
Go visit art museums.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.143
Eat dinner nice and slow.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.771
That's the way you should live.

28:52.689 --> 28:53.857
That's all you need.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.404
Okay.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.827
Thank you, ma'am. Please take care of her.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.328
Mmm, she's safe with me.

29:08.371 --> 29:10.957
Oh, wow. You're so young and beautiful.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.043
I've heard a lot about you.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.881
I was Ms. Moon's teacher
when she was a student.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.300
But I had to quit my job a long time ago.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.720
Now it seems I've got
another student to take care of.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.014
Come on.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.813
Hungry? Want me to make you
some noodles? Would you like that?

29:56.878 --> 29:59.506
I texted you earlier
saying I'd be out until 10:00.

30:00.089 --> 30:00.924
Did you get it?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.134
You trying to start something?

30:04.260 --> 30:06.721
You're the one
who's starting things here, you know.

30:08.264 --> 30:10.600
Did you go and meet with Hye-jeong? Why?

30:12.644 --> 30:13.645
Why?

30:14.229 --> 30:16.147
You're starting to scare me, hon.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.275
I'm just trying to have
a calm conversation.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.987
The past is in the past.
The future's what's ahead.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.990
I don't have any other options.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.742
I'm not so sure about that.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.745
So I looked into your other options.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.664
But why did it have to be Hye-jeong?

30:35.458 --> 30:38.795
What did Hye-jeong say? Do I have one?

30:38.795 --> 30:39.963
Who else could I ask?

30:40.964 --> 30:44.133
Sa-ra's out since she's
ruining her life with drugs.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.970
So Jae-jun, that thug?

30:47.470 --> 30:48.721
Or Myeong-o, who disappeared?

30:48.721 --> 30:51.349
Or your mother who's been giving
some shaman millions of won?

30:53.977 --> 30:55.603
You're really doing this then?

30:57.188 --> 30:59.148
You're really going to take their side?

31:05.738 --> 31:08.199
If I'm taking sides, it will be Ye-sol's.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.537
If you have ever felt
even the slightest bit of guilt

31:12.537 --> 31:13.997
for me or your daughter, then...

31:15.999 --> 31:18.418
you wouldn't have said anything.
Nothing. You should've waited.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.757
But clearly, you don't feel any guilt.

31:26.676 --> 31:27.677
You don't.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.861
- Anything new today?
- Not really.

31:44.861 --> 31:46.529
Just took Louis to the groomer.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.197
When are you free?

31:48.948 --> 31:50.617
I'm working here this weekend.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.660
Why?

31:52.660 --> 31:54.746
Guess we're closing this weekend, then.

31:55.663 --> 31:59.250
I want to get a Christmas present
for a friend, but I have no idea what.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.712
Would you like to come with me?
She's pretty young.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.548
There isn't anything in the store?

32:05.548 --> 32:09.093
Hmm, is it the redhead
or the racing flag girl with the accent?

32:09.093 --> 32:10.637
Aren't you listening to me?

32:11.220 --> 32:13.139
I just need you to tell me
if something's green or red.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.891
Fuck, it's Christmas so it's all...

32:16.517 --> 32:17.936
Are you free or not?

32:20.271 --> 32:21.731
What exactly counts as "new"?

32:22.482 --> 32:23.316
What?

32:23.316 --> 32:25.318
You asked if there was anything new.

32:26.235 --> 32:28.655
Yeon-jin's husband
came to the store by himself.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.658
Does that count as "anything new"?

32:33.201 --> 32:35.370
He did? Why?

32:35.370 --> 32:36.871
I have no idea.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.291
He tried on a shirt and then he left.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.255
- CCTV
- NOVEMBER

32:47.465 --> 32:49.759
Was it the first time,
or has he been here before?

32:49.759 --> 32:51.928
It's the first time I've seen him.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.472
But I'm not sure if he came
when someone else was working.

32:55.598 --> 32:58.434
How long do we keep these?
None were deleted?

32:59.352 --> 33:01.187
We keep them for 30 days.

33:01.187 --> 33:04.524
But anything from before October 19th
has been reformatted.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.819
You reformatted it? Why?

33:08.778 --> 33:10.863
Yeon-jin had asked me to erase it.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.575
There he is. Look.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.320
Son Myeong-o?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.656
Yeah. Our director asked about him.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.492
He showed me
some of their security footage

33:56.492 --> 33:58.745
and asked me if the man was Son Myeong-o.

33:59.537 --> 34:00.371
When was that?

34:00.872 --> 34:04.292
I told him all I knew about Myeong-o,
but I never heard anything about footage.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.210
A little less than a month ago.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.254
I must've forgot.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.882
But yeah, they came to talk to Yeo-jeong.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.803
The police really came to see Yeo-jeong?

34:19.974 --> 34:23.978
Moon Dong-eun,
you're a lot more interesting now.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.253
Hey, Dr. Joo?

34:49.754 --> 34:50.922
I thought that was you.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.633
I saw you walk by earlier,
but I wasn't sure.

34:54.133 --> 34:56.052
I've been meaning
to get in touch with you.

34:56.552 --> 34:59.138
You asked me to let you know
if anyone came to the morgue.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.848
Yeah. A woman?

35:00.848 --> 35:02.600
Uh, no. It was a man.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.644
Uh, he came in like two hours ago.

35:07.188 --> 35:08.189
Here's his number.

35:10.024 --> 35:10.858
SON MYEONG-O

35:10.858 --> 35:12.527
<i>I never actually met him.</i>

35:13.111 --> 35:15.196
All I had was his cell phone number.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.448
A long time after that,
I tried to call him.

35:18.449 --> 35:19.700
Could you tell me when?

35:20.451 --> 35:22.870
October 19th, 11:15 that night, I think.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.998
But he hung up as soon as he answered.

35:25.998 --> 35:27.166
Cursed me out.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.128
That's very detailed information.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.755
I keep records on my phone.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.258
Understandable.

35:36.551 --> 35:37.885
Why'd you try to call him?

35:37.885 --> 35:41.722
Ah. That was back when I was
working at Seoul Joo General.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.307
There's this body at the hospital.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.769
This death was concluded
as a suicide in 2004.

35:47.895 --> 35:50.273
Their family did not agree
with the investigation.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.483
So the hospital refused to process it.

35:53.067 --> 35:56.195
So when I heard there was a visitor,
I thought it was family...

35:56.696 --> 35:58.322
But it turned out to be Mr. Son.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.408
Were you the doctor
in charge of that case?

36:00.408 --> 36:01.492
No.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.369
Ah.

36:04.036 --> 36:05.496
There is something I forgot to say.

36:05.496 --> 36:08.249
The previous and the current
hospital directors are my parents.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.043
Oh, I see.

36:13.921 --> 36:17.049
I'm sorry, did I do something wrong
when I called Mr. Son?

36:18.134 --> 36:19.302
No, not really.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.598
But you do happen to be
the last person who called Mr. Son.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.600
Oh.

36:27.852 --> 36:31.063
In that case, I do sound suspicious.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.357
What?

36:34.734 --> 36:35.651
Just kidding.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.446
That wasn't too funny.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.866
Could you text me
if you have any other questions?

36:41.866 --> 36:43.117
I have an appointment soon.

37:24.033 --> 37:28.454
SON MYEONG-O

37:35.044 --> 37:36.379
So you wanted me to...

37:39.465 --> 37:41.050
find Son Myeong-o.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.414
Weather's great,
but I was feeling a bit down.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.749
I hear you'll even see patients at night.

38:14.709 --> 38:15.710
Well, I'm glad.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.338
A lot of patients come
even when they don't need an umbrella.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.049
Do you have a girlfriend?

38:22.717 --> 38:25.177
Hmm? Probably have a few.

38:26.178 --> 38:27.888
My girl's very clever and pretty,

38:28.389 --> 38:30.516
but she can also act very cold sometimes.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.019
So you're dating a mean girl then?

38:35.187 --> 38:36.397
Let me ask you.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.025
How much can guys usually forgive?

38:40.276 --> 38:41.861
Assuming the girl's done bad things?

38:42.862 --> 38:43.946
I'm not sure.

38:45.406 --> 38:49.118
Guys don't usually want to marry
women who've had plastic surgery.

38:50.411 --> 38:53.164
But they won't care what work
you've had done if they don't know.

38:54.373 --> 38:55.833
But what if he already found out?

38:56.751 --> 38:58.336
Then I think you should just get filler.

38:58.919 --> 39:02.381
You'll still be able to keep your beauty,
but it'll disappear over time.

39:02.381 --> 39:05.760
That way, you can keep playing dumb
until he learns the truth.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.390
I didn't know fillers could be romantic.

39:12.683 --> 39:15.436
I guess I'll have to see if you're right.
I'll need you to put me under.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.688
I need to see
how the filler will react before I--

39:17.688 --> 39:19.231
It's okay. I know you're good.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.901
I just don't like how it feels
when filler goes in.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.737
All right, get some sleep.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.942
I'm sure privacy is very important to you.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.945
So I picked Seoul instead of Semyeong.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.157
I haven't been here in a while, in Seoul.

40:10.658 --> 40:11.492
This is nice.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.872
I heard about the two of you.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.584
Then you probably didn't hear everything.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.558
I'm injecting the propofol
into the IV now,

40:35.558 --> 40:37.101
so you'll feel sleep soon.

40:38.018 --> 40:39.770
Start counting backwards from ten.

40:41.647 --> 40:42.481
Ten...

40:48.070 --> 40:49.947
- It's been too long, Mr. Ha.
- Yeah.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.116
May I take your code, ma'am?

40:52.992 --> 40:53.993
Thank you so much.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.121
Nine...

41:15.556 --> 41:16.390
Eight...

41:20.519 --> 41:22.188
Have you heard this before?

41:23.772 --> 41:25.941
If there's still air in this
before I administer it,

41:25.941 --> 41:27.860
you could die right here and now.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.278
Seven.

41:30.696 --> 41:31.530
What?

41:32.615 --> 41:33.782
Son Myeong-o...

41:34.950 --> 41:36.118
what did you do to him?

41:57.306 --> 41:58.140
Hey, there.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.366
What's up?

42:15.866 --> 42:18.077
One minute. Then I'm gone.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.789
You said you wanted to talk, so talk.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.958
Wow, you haven't changed.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.336
Listen closely, Yeon-jin.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.922
You know that asshole, Jae-jun?

42:30.673 --> 42:32.383
I did everything for that bastard.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.970
I drive for him, I keep him company,
I act like I'm his friend.

42:35.970 --> 42:39.181
And you probably know
I didn't go to college.

42:39.682 --> 42:42.601
But I basically went there.
I signed his attendance.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.564
So it really hurts my fucking pride

42:47.481 --> 42:48.607
to only be called a driver.

42:48.607 --> 42:51.110
Get on with it. You're pissing me off.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.947
Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

42:55.573 --> 43:00.327
If I were him, I'd have spent all my time
becoming a director at Jaepyeong,

43:01.996 --> 43:03.330
instead of fucking you.

43:12.256 --> 43:13.382
Who the fuck...

43:14.300 --> 43:15.634
Hey, fucking asshole.

43:16.719 --> 43:17.720
Don't call me.

43:22.349 --> 43:25.352
- You trying to record me or something?
- What're you saying?

43:26.186 --> 43:28.564
It's those damn junkies
that keep calling me...

43:30.566 --> 43:31.567
Hey, what the...

43:33.527 --> 43:35.779
- Oh, you crazy bitch.
- Myeong-o.

43:35.779 --> 43:38.073
Honestly, I expected more from you.

43:38.574 --> 43:40.159
All you have is that I cheated?

43:41.118 --> 43:43.787
If you want to threaten me,
you'll have to try harder.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.373
You can't make money that easily.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.835
I'll buy you a new phone.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.012
How about this one?

44:01.472 --> 44:02.431
Yoon So-hee?

44:08.103 --> 44:09.104
Yoon So-hee?

44:10.397 --> 44:11.231
Who's that?

44:11.231 --> 44:13.192
Oh, bitch, please!

44:15.444 --> 44:18.113
Yoon So-hee's body's at Joo General.

44:18.113 --> 44:19.365
Been there for years.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.951
That day, you were on the roof,
weren't you?

44:24.036 --> 44:25.704
What the hell are you saying now?

44:27.164 --> 44:28.165
You're not making sense.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.501
It does make sense, doesn't it, though?

44:32.044 --> 44:34.672
The evidence I need
to prove you were there that day...

44:38.133 --> 44:39.134
is right here.

44:42.012 --> 44:45.432
There! You're finally starting
to show your true self!

44:48.852 --> 44:50.479
Check if you don't believe me.

44:51.063 --> 44:54.733
But I'll be taking this
to your station tomorrow.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.138
Holy shit!

45:24.138 --> 45:26.682
I'm not going to
have to haggle with you at all!

45:26.682 --> 45:28.726
You actually were there, weren't you?

45:31.145 --> 45:33.272
You know I was joking
about the director thing?

45:33.772 --> 45:34.690
I'll take cash.

45:35.190 --> 45:37.693
Let's start with around a billion won?

45:40.070 --> 45:41.655
You son of a bitch!

45:55.878 --> 45:57.880
This condom was pretty expensive...

45:58.589 --> 46:00.090
It's strawberry-flavored.

46:02.134 --> 46:02.968
If I...

46:04.970 --> 46:07.139
can use this on you, I'll take off 10 mil.

46:08.056 --> 46:11.059
And I'll take off another 10
if we do it without it.

46:11.059 --> 46:12.144
Sound good?

46:14.646 --> 46:17.524
But wait, I almost forgot.

46:18.233 --> 46:19.234
Unfortunately...

46:23.405 --> 46:24.865
it's already been a minute.

47:05.197 --> 47:06.532
<i>And then what?</i>

47:10.702 --> 47:12.371
<i>What did you do after that?</i>

47:13.956 --> 47:15.374
What? Who's there?

47:17.167 --> 47:18.085
Who said that?

47:26.510 --> 47:28.262
How did you sleep, Ms. Park?
