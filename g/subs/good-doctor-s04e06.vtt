Jillian, I need those stats on elective
surgeries for my budget meeting.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.683
And a coffee.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.018
[sighs]

12:08.102 --> 12:09.186
Jillian?

12:10.646 --> 12:12.773
She's not there. I need approval for this.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.361
And this.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.198
You said I couldn't give her the frogs.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.493
Oh, you can't give her this either.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.828
You don't know what it is.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.331
I know it would mean more if you had to
leave the building to get it.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.545
I would like to do
the suction D&amp;C surgery.

12:35.713 --> 12:39.550
I assume your religious convictions
haven't changed in the last few hours.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.759
No.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.262
But I believe I was
put in this program for a reason.

12:43.345 --> 12:46.849
So, if you think it's important for me
to learn how to do an abortion,

12:46.932 --> 12:48.017
then I should learn.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.898
Take Jordan to the skills lab.
Run the surgery steps.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.025
You two will handle the D&amp;C yourselves.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.276
With you.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.405
How are you going to supervise
my supervision

13:01.489 --> 13:02.573
if you're not there?

13:02.656 --> 13:04.867
I will help you prep
and debrief afterwards.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.411
But this patient doesn't need
a gallery of strangers

13:07.495 --> 13:09.914
standing around, gawking
at her most private experience.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.040
Sorry to interrupt.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.750
Ben woke up complaining of pain.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.376
Did you check the incision?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.628
The pain is in his arm.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.216
Now test external rotation
of the shoulder.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.383
[winces]

13:21.467 --> 13:23.010
-We're almost done.
-[exhales sharply]

13:23.093 --> 13:24.512
Can you describe the pain?

13:24.595 --> 13:25.596
Aah! [winces]

13:27.640 --> 13:28.933
We'll call it a 10.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.519
It's been hurting for years,
but, aah, this is…

13:31.602 --> 13:32.770
This is something else.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.855
How did you injure your shoulder before?

13:38.108 --> 13:39.318
I was in a… [sighs]

13:41.487 --> 13:44.031
I was in a convoy in Kandahar,

13:44.990 --> 13:45.991
and there was a…

13:46.617 --> 13:47.618
[breath trembling]

13:49.495 --> 13:51.789
[stammers] I dislocated my…

13:52.540 --> 13:54.458
You don't need to discuss it with us.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.002
What did you find?

13:57.086 --> 13:59.672
Swelling, sensitivity to touch,
discoloration.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.799
-Could be CRPS.
-What is that?

14:01.882 --> 14:03.634
Well, it appears the car accident

14:03.717 --> 14:05.219
aggravated a prior injury.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.138
You've developed
complex regional pain syndrome.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.599
We'll start you
on Gabapentin and Dilaudid.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.102
Opioids make me a little insane.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.021
We could do a stellate ganglion block.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.857
It's an injection of anesthetic
near the spine

14:18.941 --> 14:20.609
that blocks the pain signals,

14:20.693 --> 14:22.570
and could also help the PTSD.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.991
I've been treated for PTSD for years.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.325
Why haven't I heard about this?

14:28.409 --> 14:30.661
It's experimental, but promising.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.288
The procedure comes with risks:

14:32.371 --> 14:34.832
vascular injury, infection,
major hematoma.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.501
Dr. Lim, I've been taking a risk
every time I go to sleep.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.506
I want to do it.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.384
Stellate block is an accepted procedure
for treatment of pain.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.928
Which you wouldn't have suggested
if the patient didn't

14:48.012 --> 14:49.763
also have a mental health condition.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.099
-[birds chirp]
-I hear Jordan's back on the D&amp;C,

14:52.182 --> 14:54.977
-in spite of her righteous indignation.
-Is something chirping?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.186
I think you're being unfair.

14:56.270 --> 14:59.648
Well, if anyone's being unfair, it's me.
I told Jordan to do it.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.733
I told her.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.485
We make decisions that
are hard to live with all the time.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.445
We make them anyway.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.322
And I told her pissing off the Chief

15:06.405 --> 15:08.490
was a very bad way
to start your residency.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.911
Glad you're still moonlighting
as surgical department camp counselor,

15:11.994 --> 15:14.121
but I don't mean
you were being unfair to Jordan.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.748
You're being unfair to the patient.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.250
She's facing
an emotionally fraught procedure.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.044
She needs the support of her doctors.

15:20.127 --> 15:23.589
And who she's getting is a rookie
who thinks she's committing murder.

15:23.672 --> 15:24.757
And Shaun.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.845
I have a point.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.224
I'll lead Jordan through the D&amp;C myself.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.392
You're happy.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.061
Dr. Murphy will be happy.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.604
My cup runneth over.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.106
Now get whatever's in that box
out of my department.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.237
[sighs]

15:48.614 --> 15:49.823
[retching]

15:51.283 --> 15:52.368
Morning sickness.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.536
Nurse Ella's.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.206
Rose claims she can feel her pregnancy.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.166
She was right about the guy in Room 318.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.918
He had a clot in his ankle.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.878
I'm sure she picked up
on some subtle clues,

16:02.962 --> 16:05.506
like the guy moaning
and grasping his ankle.

16:06.173 --> 16:09.385
Get a CT to rule out
abdominal injury from her fall.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.764
[Dr. Lim] We're going to
insert a thin needle into your neck

16:13.847 --> 16:15.599
so we can inject the anesthetic.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.059
It may sting a bit.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.025
Use an in-plane approach
to place the needle

16:25.109 --> 16:27.528
between the C6 tubercle
and carotid artery.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.137
[Claire] You might feel some discomfort.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.398

17:08.777 --> 17:09.987
[cellphone chimes]

17:23.250 --> 17:24.251
[Dr. Lim] What's wrong?

17:24.710 --> 17:25.711
Zoe's hurt.

17:25.794 --> 17:26.795
I'm okay.

17:26.879 --> 17:27.880
Get some ice.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.256
Let me take a look.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.466
What happened?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.718
-I hit her.
-[Zoe] I was laying next to him.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.261
I know I shouldn't,

17:34.344 --> 17:36.764
but the shot just made his pain
feel so much better.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.057
-I thought…
-Zo.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.768
You didn't do anything wrong.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.604
There was a noise in the hall.

17:43.687 --> 17:44.730
-I lashed out.
-I know.

17:45.814 --> 17:46.899
I didn't mean to.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.275
I'm sorry.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.116
Nothing's broken.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.160
I can get you something for the swelling.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.662
No. I'm okay.
I'm gonna go home, get cleaned up.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.541
I just need some time.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.504
I love you.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.310
I think we can help Ben.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.646
There have been some promising results

18:25.729 --> 18:28.273
using Vagal Nerve Stimulation
to treat PTSD.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.317
[Dr. Lim] His scarring
would make it impossible

18:30.400 --> 18:32.528
to expose and find the nerve
without damaging it.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.197
Those scars
are the reason that we need to try.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.784
Imagine reliving
your worst nightmare over and over again.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.662
Why doesn't anyone here
want to do the job they were hired for?

18:41.745 --> 18:43.539
What Ben needs is psychological help.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.706
I've ordered a consult.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.126
Leave it to the people
who are trained to do it.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.545
It sets a bad precedent
to force a resident

18:49.628 --> 18:51.588
to do a procedure
they're not comfortable with.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.715
Does anyone around here
not have an opinion

18:53.799 --> 18:55.634
about who should do
that damn abortion?

18:55.717 --> 18:58.387
Jordan had a choice,
and in my opinion, she made the right one.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.889
It's not a true choice
if you're coerced by your boss.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.933
I asked her to do her job.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.519
You took an opportunity
from a resident who wants to learn

19:05.602 --> 19:07.020
in favor of one who doesn't.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.523
Is this song and dance
about Jordan doing the procedure

19:09.606 --> 19:11.608
or your niece not doing it?

19:12.234 --> 19:13.235
Neither.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.738
There's a misconception that Olivia
came to St. Bonaventure because of me.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.741
She's here because of your reputation.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.535
The great Dr. Lim,

19:21.618 --> 19:24.997
a master class in technique,
professionalism, empathy.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.834
Lately, it doesn't seem like
that reputation holds up.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.592
[Jordan] I'm giving you
an antibiotic to prevent infection.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.636
The vacuum aspiration
will take about 15 minutes,

19:39.720 --> 19:41.972
and you'll be numbed
with a local anesthetic.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.683
Conscious sedation is also an option,

19:44.766 --> 19:47.603
but you will need someone
to drive you home afterwards.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.733
Do you have any questions for me?

19:58.447 --> 19:59.656
I'm scared.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.249
[sighs softly]

20:10.459 --> 20:13.337
Are you certain you wanna
go ahead with the abortion?

20:21.303 --> 20:22.387
Yes.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.267
Then you don't have to be scared.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.771
You're the making
the right decision for you.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.197
Give her another 400 micrograms
of misoprostol.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.698
I'll be back for the procedure.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.868
This doesn't work.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.870
I need these numbers
in spreadsheet format.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.789
-Thank you.
-[Dr. Park] Oh, excuse me.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.794
Dr. Park?

20:53.877 --> 20:55.545
Rose's CT was normal.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.130
Get an upper GI barium study.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.884
First quarter supply costs you requested.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.428
Also, one of your first-years seems upset.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.347
He's been in the stairwell for a while.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.602
[Dr. Lim] Everything okay in here?

21:12.479 --> 21:14.606
I just needed some quiet.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.945
Surgeons come into the stairwell
for two reasons,

21:20.654 --> 21:22.281
fire drills or doctor trauma.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.491
You having a fire drill?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.454
I just wish we had a more
effective treatment for Ben.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.292
His head's so messed up,
and we can't help him.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.756
I don't think this is about Ben.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.894
Have you ever lost a patient

21:53.770 --> 21:55.522
you knew you could have saved?

22:01.194 --> 22:02.821
When COVID was at its worst,

22:03.822 --> 22:06.450
we had to cancel
all non-urgent procedures.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.995
A young mom with a heart condition was

22:11.538 --> 22:13.040
more urgent than I thought.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.419
And she died waiting
for me to put her on the schedule.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.844
How do you get past that?

22:28.388 --> 22:30.348
You get past it because that's the job.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.353
You will always remember it.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.399
And you will eventually stop reliving it.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.195
How can you be so sure?

22:45.947 --> 22:48.158
Because if you don't,
you can't be a surgeon.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.455
And I'm pretty sure you're a surgeon.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.755
I should get back to work.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.019
Insert the speculum.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.905
Now dilate the cervix.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.372
Begin suction.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.514
Begin gentle suction in the uterus.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.355
Is anything wrong?

24:01.481 --> 24:02.482
You're okay.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.442
Dr. Allen, I can take it from here.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.118
Don't worry. We're almost done.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.786
You're gonna be just fine.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.917
You have no idea
what that woman was going through,

24:21.001 --> 24:23.211
-and you made it worse for her.
-I know. I didn't…

24:23.295 --> 24:26.047
You had an opportunity to opt out
before you walked in there,

24:26.131 --> 24:27.507
but you agreed to do
the procedure,

24:27.591 --> 24:30.343
you took on an obligation to that patient,
and you failed her.

24:30.427 --> 24:34.181
If you ever do anything like that again,
I will have you removed from my program.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.516
Maybe you should be
cleaning bedpans for a while.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.727
Hopefully there's no moral objection
to that.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.487
Why are there adult toys on my desk?

24:49.946 --> 24:52.073
I've heard good things about the Llama,

24:52.157 --> 24:54.451
but online reviews aren't always accurate.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.161
Do you have a favorite?

24:58.455 --> 24:59.539
They're for Lea.

24:59.956 --> 25:02.334
Which one do you like the most, Claire?

25:02.584 --> 25:03.418
Uh…

25:05.921 --> 25:06.922
Uh…

25:07.380 --> 25:10.467
Evidence suggests that trauma
changes the way the brain works.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.094
An overactive amygdala
can heighten someone's response

25:13.178 --> 25:15.305
to emotional stimuli, including fear.

25:16.139 --> 25:19.476
I think we should consider
amygdala ablation for Ben.

If it was a tumor
that was causing these reactions,

25:39.371 --> 25:40.914
you wouldn't hesitate to remove it.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.123
But there is no tumor.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.751
You're talking about
inflicting damage on his brain.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.337
He could suffer a stroke
or come out in a coma

25:47.420 --> 25:48.922
or not come out at all.

[Shaun] If you use
a stereotactic laser approach

25:51.424 --> 25:54.386
rather than an open craniotomy,
you would greatly reduce the risks.

25:54.469 --> 25:55.720
This is not your case!

25:55.804 --> 25:57.138
You cannot jump into this one

25:57.222 --> 25:59.557

Stop! You're off course.

On the current trajectory,
you will penetrate
