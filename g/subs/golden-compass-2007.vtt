00:40.300 --> 00:44.794
There are many universes
and many earths...

00:44.838 --> 00:46.829
parallel to each other.

00:49.042 --> 00:50.600
Worlds like yours...

00:50.644 --> 00:54.102
where people's souls
live inside their bodies...

00:59.352 --> 01:01.445
and worlds like mine...

01:01.488 --> 01:03.786
where they walk beside us...

01:03.823 --> 01:07.623
as animal spirits
we call dæmons.

01:09.396 --> 01:11.227
Are we going to see the child?

01:12.532 --> 01:14.295
I should think so.

01:15.635 --> 01:17.569
So many worlds...

01:17.604 --> 01:20.835
but connecting them all is Dust.

01:20.874 --> 01:24.207
Dust was here before
the witches of the air...

01:24.244 --> 01:27.270
the Gyptians of the water...

01:27.314 --> 01:29.805
and the bears of the ice.

01:31.718 --> 01:35.677
In my world,
scholars invented an alethiometer...

01:37.457 --> 01:39.755
a golden compass...

01:39.793 --> 01:42.728
and it showed them
all that was hidden.

01:44.464 --> 01:48.560
But the ruling power, fearing
any truth but their own...

01:48.601 --> 01:51.468
destroyed these devices...

01:51.504 --> 01:55.770
and forbade
the very mention of Dust.

01:55.809 --> 01:59.176
One compass remains, however...

01:59.212 --> 02:01.976
and only one who can read it.

02:02.349 --> 02:03.714
You'll never get me!

02:07.153 --> 02:09.178
Let's go get 'em, Lyra.

02:09.589 --> 02:10.954
Come on!

02:10.990 --> 02:12.321
Gonna get you!

02:12.359 --> 02:14.293
I'll get you first!

02:14.327 --> 02:15.988
Billy!

02:16.029 --> 02:17.997
You come back here!

02:18.031 --> 02:19.430
Leave me alone!

02:19.466 --> 02:20.763
Faster, faster!

02:20.800 --> 02:22.529
We're gonna get you!

02:22.569 --> 02:24.298
Run, Roger!

02:27.006 --> 02:28.030
You are now Gobbled!

02:28.074 --> 02:31.703
You've gotta do whatever I say!

02:33.513 --> 02:35.481
Go, Roger! Run!

02:38.718 --> 02:39.685
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

02:39.719 --> 02:42.552
- Leave us alone!
- Get him!

02:45.925 --> 02:47.517
Come on. Run!

02:50.597 --> 02:52.326
Hurry up, Roger,
or they'll Gobble you!

02:53.366 --> 02:54.560
Faster!

02:59.739 --> 03:01.832
Hurry up!

03:01.875 --> 03:04.173
Stop!

03:04.210 --> 03:08.169
If you value your lives,
come no further.

03:08.214 --> 03:09.408
Why?

03:09.449 --> 03:11.212
We Gobbled him fair and square.

03:11.251 --> 03:13.719
This ain't no game, Billy Costa.

03:13.753 --> 03:15.653
Don't you know what this gate is?

03:15.688 --> 03:17.986
It's the back door
to your stupid college.

03:18.024 --> 03:19.013
So?

03:19.058 --> 03:21.526
There's a curse on this gate.

03:21.561 --> 03:24.223
You Gyptians ought to know that.

03:24.264 --> 03:25.424
Crossin' this gate...

03:25.465 --> 03:28.025
is worse than touching
someone's dæmon...

03:28.067 --> 03:29.398
with your bare hands.

03:29.436 --> 03:31.768
Why ain't nothin'
happened to you, then?

03:31.805 --> 03:33.602
'Cause we live 'ere.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.733
We got safe passage, see?

03:35.775 --> 03:38.300
And anyway, my mother's
the one who put the curse...

03:38.344 --> 03:40.005
on this gate in the first place.

03:40.046 --> 03:41.377
What mother?

03:41.414 --> 03:43.109
I heard you was an orphink...

03:43.149 --> 03:46.346
and your uncle only left you 'ere
'cause nobody wanted you.

03:46.386 --> 03:47.910
Come 'ere and say that.

03:48.755 --> 03:50.620
Don't, Billy.

03:52.592 --> 03:54.423
You should listen to your mate.

03:54.461 --> 03:58.090
The scholars got this special room
where they deal with trespassers.

03:58.131 --> 04:00.156
They got this poison gown, right...

04:00.200 --> 04:02.100
and it burns you alive!

04:02.135 --> 04:05.036
Rubbish. Hand him over.

04:05.805 --> 04:09.707
It ain't rubbish.
I'll prove it. I'll steal it.

04:09.742 --> 04:11.403
You can have Roger.

04:11.444 --> 04:13.969
As long as you try it on.

04:14.013 --> 04:16.914
All right. Bring it with you tonight.

04:16.950 --> 04:18.212
Or else...

04:19.152 --> 04:20.676
War.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.588
Billy, don't!

04:25.558 --> 04:26.786
See ya later, then.

04:26.826 --> 04:28.726
OK.

04:30.196 --> 04:32.221
Well done, Billy!

04:32.265 --> 04:34.290
You ain't really gonna
hand me over to them?

04:34.334 --> 04:35.801
Of course not.

04:35.835 --> 04:37.598
I'll steal any old scholar's gown.

04:37.637 --> 04:39.571
He'll never try it on anyway.

04:47.046 --> 04:48.479
- Lord Asriel?
- Morning, Hunt.

04:48.515 --> 04:51.109
Well, the Master will be relieved
to hear you've arrived safely.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.674
I'm sure he will.

05:25.952 --> 05:28.352
I wish you'd listen
to me once in a while.

05:28.388 --> 05:30.288
Stop being such a coward.

05:30.323 --> 05:32.723
If I weren't such a coward,
where would you be?

05:32.759 --> 05:35.728
In the Retiring Room already.

05:42.168 --> 05:43.533
Come on, quick.

05:48.841 --> 05:51.071
Let's find a robe
and get out of here.

05:52.011 --> 05:55.344
Don't be silly.
I want to look around.

05:55.381 --> 05:58.145
You do know that if you get
a smack, I hurt too?

06:03.623 --> 06:05.420
Oh, Lyra.

06:05.458 --> 06:08.052
You're gonna get us caught.

06:11.864 --> 06:14.594
Oh, no! I told you!

06:17.704 --> 06:20.298
Lord Asriel is an eminent
fellow of the college.

06:20.340 --> 06:24.333
And as master of Jordan,
you must force him...

06:24.377 --> 06:26.242
to abandon his plan.

06:26.279 --> 06:28.713
They're talking about Uncle Asriel.

06:28.748 --> 06:31.376
I speak for the Magisterium.

06:31.417 --> 06:34.784
The Magisterium has no authority
within these walls.

06:34.821 --> 06:37.619
My dear fellow...

06:37.657 --> 06:40.956
the Magisterium
has authority everywhere...

06:42.195 --> 06:45.460
and Lord Asriel will be silenced...

06:45.498 --> 06:48.490
one way or another.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.627
That may be.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.571
But while he is at Jordan,
his proposal will be heard.

06:55.141 --> 06:58.633
I'll not dispense with centuries
of tolerance and free inquiry.

06:58.678 --> 07:00.646
And that's my final word
on the matter.

07:01.648 --> 07:03.639
Now, if you'll excuse me...

07:08.321 --> 07:10.789
I shall call the Council to order.

07:17.363 --> 07:18.796
I guess we lost that bet.

07:18.831 --> 07:21.299
Hush, Pan.

07:45.892 --> 07:48.884
Lyra, he's leaving. Let's go.

07:48.928 --> 07:49.917
Lyra.

07:51.464 --> 07:55.127
- The professor... a really hard time.
- Oh, no.

07:56.302 --> 07:57.963
It's Stelmaria.

08:01.507 --> 08:05.705
The master asked me to decant a bottle
of the '99 Tokay for you, Lord Asriel.

08:05.745 --> 08:07.713
He remembered
you were partial to it.

08:08.548 --> 08:09.572
Thank you.

08:28.568 --> 08:30.365
- Lyra!
- It's poisoned.

08:30.403 --> 08:32.530
- Nonsense.
- It ain't nonsense.

08:32.572 --> 08:34.802
I saw that man
from the Magisterium...

08:34.841 --> 08:36.808
pour some powder into the wine.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.705
Go back in there.

08:42.749 --> 08:44.307
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

08:44.350 --> 08:46.284
Go on.

08:54.727 --> 08:57.594
Ah, Lord Asriel.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.120
This is a rare pleasure.

08:59.165 --> 09:04.364
May I introduce
Fra Pavel of the Magisterium?

09:04.403 --> 09:10.103
We've never met, but I've followed
your exploits closely, Lord Asriel.

09:10.143 --> 09:11.770
That's what the smell is.

09:11.811 --> 09:14.279
Master, gentlemen,
I shall get straight to the point.

09:14.313 --> 09:15.940
Hunt, the lights.

09:18.284 --> 09:21.583
This photogram was taken
at the magnetic North Pole...

09:23.156 --> 09:25.590
in Svalbard...

09:27.193 --> 09:29.184
kingdom of the ice bears.

09:29.228 --> 09:31.128
Ice bears, Pan.

09:31.164 --> 09:35.260
Lord Asriel, is that light rising up
from the man's body or coming down?

09:35.301 --> 09:38.361
No, that's coming down from the sky,
but that's not light.

09:42.375 --> 09:43.808
- It's Dust.
- Dust?

09:48.714 --> 09:51.205
- What's Dust?
- I don't know.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.740
It can't be the normal sort.

09:52.785 --> 09:55.151
They've got plenty of that here.

09:55.188 --> 09:57.019
<i>Mirabile dictu,</i> gentlemen.

09:57.056 --> 10:00.321
Allow Lord Asriel to explain.

10:00.359 --> 10:03.954
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

10:03.996 --> 10:07.432
It could be an aberration
or malfunction of some kind.

10:07.466 --> 10:10.333
No, it is no aberration.

10:11.604 --> 10:14.971
The behavior of these particles
is quite unmistakable.

10:15.007 --> 10:19.603
Dust is flowing into this man,
through his dæmon...

10:19.645 --> 10:22.341
from a city in another world.

10:22.381 --> 10:26.340
A world much like ours in a parallel
universe coexisting with our own.

10:26.385 --> 10:29.582
Invisible, intangible, inaccessible!

10:29.622 --> 10:30.646
Until now.

10:30.690 --> 10:34.421
From there, and from
a billion other worlds, Dust flows.

10:34.460 --> 10:37.156
Worlds of infinite possibilities.

10:37.196 --> 10:38.788
Some where men have no dæmons.

10:38.831 --> 10:40.526
Some where dæmons have no men.

10:40.566 --> 10:43.160
People without dæmons.
That's impossible.

10:43.202 --> 10:45.864
And even some where
there is no Magisterium...

10:47.640 --> 10:49.801
and no Authority.

10:50.743 --> 10:52.301
That is heresy.

10:52.345 --> 10:54.210
That...

10:55.848 --> 10:57.816
is the truth.

10:57.850 --> 11:02.344
I wouldn't recommend the Tokay,
gentlemen. It's corked.

11:02.388 --> 11:05.551
To discover the source of Dust,
I intend to travel to these worlds.

11:05.591 --> 11:08.059
With a sufficient source
of energy and...

11:08.094 --> 11:10.221
Well, a sufficient source of funds...

11:11.831 --> 11:13.662
I can effect a crossing.

11:13.699 --> 11:16.668
I humbly beg the College Council
to fund such a journey.

11:22.775 --> 11:25.403
It wasn't my fault.
She wouldn't listen to me.

11:26.946 --> 11:30.575
I will not have my niece
slithering round like an alley cat.

11:30.616 --> 11:33.585
You're not very grateful, are you?

11:33.619 --> 11:35.348
I've just saved your life.

11:38.124 --> 11:40.354
Uncle, why did he try
to poison you?

11:40.393 --> 11:42.054
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yes, I would.

11:42.094 --> 11:43.994
Well, I don't see why.

11:44.030 --> 11:46.055
Apparently you're
impossible to educate.

11:46.098 --> 11:47.827
A miscreant and a liar.

11:50.369 --> 11:53.031
What will the Magisterium
do to you now?

11:53.072 --> 11:55.700
The Magisterium's days
are numbered.

11:55.741 --> 11:57.470
What does that mean?

11:57.510 --> 11:59.774
Trouble, with a bit of luck.

12:01.147 --> 12:03.047
Did you get the money you needed?

12:03.082 --> 12:04.515
Are you going North again?

12:04.550 --> 12:07.280
The College Council
has defied the Magisterium.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.254
I'm leaving immediately.

12:09.288 --> 12:10.778
Can I come with you?

12:10.823 --> 12:12.654
I want to see the ice bears
and glaciers...

12:12.692 --> 12:14.353
and learn about Dust
and everything.

12:14.393 --> 12:16.520
What do you know about Dust?

12:16.562 --> 12:18.086
- Nothing.
- Good.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.461
Keep it that way.

12:19.498 --> 12:21.762
Now be a good girl
and do what you're told.

12:21.801 --> 12:23.598
But you don't do what you're told.

12:23.636 --> 12:25.661
You don't let anybody
tell you what to do.

12:25.705 --> 12:27.536
Yes, and look at the welcome I got.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.043
Hush, Pan.

12:33.079 --> 12:35.206
I see your dæmon
still changes shape.

12:35.247 --> 12:37.112
Hasn't settled yet.

12:37.149 --> 12:38.639
Yeah.

12:40.786 --> 12:43.277
That's to do with Dust, isn't it?

12:43.322 --> 12:45.256
Why kids' dæmons
can change shape...

12:45.291 --> 12:47.156
but grown-ups' dæmons can't.

12:48.094 --> 12:50.255
Lyra.

12:50.296 --> 12:52.389
Dust is none of your business.

12:53.799 --> 12:55.767
Now you try and behave.

13:10.282 --> 13:15.117
My Uncle Asriel said he'd take me
to the North next time he goes. He swore it.

13:15.154 --> 13:16.712
'Cause he needs my help, see.

13:16.756 --> 13:18.087
What for?

13:19.125 --> 13:20.956
Fightin', probably.

13:20.993 --> 13:22.585
Or spying.

13:22.628 --> 13:24.596
He uses me as a spy sometimes.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.564
Like now, for instance.

13:26.599 --> 13:28.533
I'm supposed to be keeping
an eye on them Gobblers...

13:28.567 --> 13:29.556
Come on!

13:29.602 --> 13:32.002
...'cause they took them
Gyptian kids up Banbury way.

13:32.038 --> 13:33.471
Billy Costa told me.

13:33.506 --> 13:36.634
I heard them Gobblers
take you down to hell.

13:36.675 --> 13:38.643
Course they don't.

13:40.046 --> 13:41.877
You're afraid of them, ain't you?

13:41.914 --> 13:43.006
No, I ain't.

13:45.985 --> 13:49.352
But the adults are,
because kids keep disappearin'.

13:49.388 --> 13:51.652
They go after the poor kids, see.

13:51.690 --> 13:55.626
The orphans
and the servant kids as well.

13:55.661 --> 13:58.255
Roger, I promise...

13:58.297 --> 14:00.891
if you was taken by the Gobblers...

14:00.933 --> 14:02.195
I'd come and rescue you.

14:04.036 --> 14:06.027
You'd come and get me too,
wouldn't you?

14:06.072 --> 14:09.838
Course. But everybody would go
looking for you if you was Gobbled.

14:09.875 --> 14:12.036
- You're a lady.
- Says who?

14:12.078 --> 14:16.378
Cook. He says that's why your uncle
left you here, to make you a lady.

14:16.415 --> 14:18.212
Nobody can make me a lady.

14:18.250 --> 14:22.084
Not the master and scholars
and porters combined, right?

14:22.121 --> 14:25.420
Take it back, or we ain't
best mates no more!

14:25.458 --> 14:27.358
All right, all right,
you ain't a lady.

14:27.393 --> 14:29.088
Lyra!

14:29.128 --> 14:32.495
Lyra Belacqua,
get down off them roofs!

14:32.531 --> 14:34.089
The Master wants you at high table!

14:36.735 --> 14:39.670
It was really...
really quite surprising.

14:39.705 --> 14:41.900
The state of your knees.

14:41.941 --> 14:44.068
And your hair.

14:44.110 --> 14:45.099
Well...

14:46.545 --> 14:47.910
It's not surprising.

14:47.947 --> 14:50.745
Roger and me's
been huntin' Gobblers.

14:50.783 --> 14:52.512
It's dirty work.

14:52.551 --> 14:55.952
'Ere, don't you make jokes
about them Gobblers.

14:55.988 --> 14:58.786
Ain't nothin' to play about
when children go missing.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.798
Lyra, my dear...

15:11.837 --> 15:15.432
the tutor of metaphysics tells me
that you've missed your lesson again.

15:15.474 --> 15:19.410
Now, I know you do not always
understand our need to educate you...

15:19.445 --> 15:23.779
but sometimes you must do
what others think... best.

15:25.484 --> 15:27.645
But I disagree, Master.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.209
Mrs. Coulter.

15:31.891 --> 15:33.290
When I was a young woman...

15:33.325 --> 15:36.385
I knew that no one could ever
really truly understand me...

15:36.428 --> 15:38.589
except, of course, my dæmon...

15:38.631 --> 15:41.657
and that it would be best
if we were free to do as we pleased.

15:46.639 --> 15:48.630
Sit down, gentlemen.

15:49.208 --> 15:51.233
- Who's she?
- Don't know.

15:51.277 --> 15:53.609
But she shut up the Master, all right.

15:53.646 --> 16:00.279
Mrs. Coulter? This is our Lyra,
Lyra Belacqua, Lord Asriel's niece.

16:00.319 --> 16:02.787
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter...

16:02.821 --> 16:05.085
a friend of the college.

16:07.826 --> 16:09.657
Lovely to meet you.

16:09.695 --> 16:12.528
Lovely to meet you too.

16:12.565 --> 16:15.557
Do you know I've met Lord Asriel?

16:16.168 --> 16:18.466
It was at the Royal Arctic Institute.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.038
We discussed
the political structure...

16:21.073 --> 16:23.439
of the ice bears of Svalbard.

16:24.343 --> 16:26.208
You've seen an ice bear?

16:27.046 --> 16:28.240
As a matter of fact...

16:28.280 --> 16:30.942
I have had an audience
with the bear king himself...

16:30.983 --> 16:32.507
Ragnar Sturlusson.

16:32.551 --> 16:35.145
And I'll tell you something
I probably shouldn't...

16:36.622 --> 16:40.183
King Ragnar is desperate
to have a dæmon of his own.

16:42.428 --> 16:45.329
Bears don't have them, you see,
and Ragnar...

16:45.364 --> 16:47.855
he likes to think of himself
as a person...

16:47.900 --> 16:50.698
and he will stop at nothing to get one.

16:52.738 --> 16:54.330
But you mustn't repeat that.

16:54.373 --> 16:56.068
Oh, I'd never.

16:59.211 --> 17:01.406
You know, I feel I can trust you.

17:05.684 --> 17:08.585
I have to go back
to the North very soon.

17:08.621 --> 17:10.589
I'm going to need an assistant.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.558
Me?

17:13.592 --> 17:15.583
- Go to the North?
- North?

17:15.627 --> 17:17.152
It's cold up there.

17:17.195 --> 17:19.664
We'd better get
the Master's permission.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.394
Master, I was wondering...

17:24.435 --> 17:26.926
if I might borrow dear Lyra.

17:29.108 --> 17:30.632
Only for a while, of course.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.936
I'm not sure
that would be consistent with...

17:33.979 --> 17:36.504
Lord Asriel's wishes
for her education.

17:38.684 --> 17:41.278
Let me deal with Asriel.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.721
You mustn't deny me
this little thing, you really mustn't.

17:53.299 --> 17:54.732
Very well.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.194
Yeah...

18:01.540 --> 18:03.565
Yeah...

18:10.949 --> 18:12.280
A bet's a bet...

18:12.318 --> 18:15.048
and Lyra was supposed
to show up with the gown.

18:15.087 --> 18:17.453
I told you they wouldn't
let her out of the college.

18:17.489 --> 18:19.047
Which one's her room?

18:19.091 --> 18:20.615
What are you gonna do?

18:20.659 --> 18:22.490
Give her a fright, that's all.

18:22.528 --> 18:25.258
We get caught,
I'll be skinned alive.

18:25.297 --> 18:28.289
Night porter's bound
to be doin' his rounds.

18:28.334 --> 18:30.461
Ratter, check if the coast is clear.

18:43.649 --> 18:45.082
It's all clear.

18:48.721 --> 18:51.246
Billy! Billy!

18:59.965 --> 19:04.834
The scholars still refuse
to hand over the last alethiometer...

19:04.870 --> 19:09.034
and now they've given Asriel
all the funds he needs.

19:09.875 --> 19:13.402
If he succeeds in proving
the existence of these other worlds...

19:13.445 --> 19:17.279
it will contradict
centuries of teaching.

19:17.316 --> 19:21.480
There will always be
freethinkers and heretics...

19:21.520 --> 19:26.287
unless we deal
with the root of the problem.

19:26.325 --> 19:29.158
That is why Mrs. Coulter's work
is so important.

19:31.163 --> 19:32.824
What progress has she made?

19:32.865 --> 19:35.959
The doctors at Bolvangar...

19:36.001 --> 19:39.129
are close to perfecting
the inoculation...

19:39.171 --> 19:43.130
against the effects of Dust.

19:43.175 --> 19:46.372
I am relieved to hear that.

19:46.412 --> 19:50.610
If we can protect our children
from the corrupting influence of Dust...

19:50.649 --> 19:53.379
before their dæmons settle...

19:53.419 --> 19:57.617
then we will nurture a generation
at peace with itself...

19:57.656 --> 20:01.422
one that will never question
our authority again.

20:03.162 --> 20:05.562
We owe it to the young...

20:06.732 --> 20:08.427
do we not?

20:12.171 --> 20:14.867
I fear our defiance
will not go unpunished...

20:19.077 --> 20:21.671
now she'll be drawn into it.

20:21.713 --> 20:22.737
We've failed her.

20:22.781 --> 20:27.241
We've protected her
as long as we could, Master.

20:27.286 --> 20:28.810
And she's still only a child.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.685
She can't possibly be
a threat to them.

20:30.722 --> 20:32.587
She is.

20:32.624 --> 20:36.185
She's meant to play
a major part in what is to come.

20:37.663 --> 20:39.528
How can you know such things?

20:41.600 --> 20:43.227
The witches.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.771
Thank you. Could you...

20:49.808 --> 20:52.709
Could you stay
by the door, Mrs. Lonsdale?

20:52.744 --> 20:55.269
It's important that I know
if I was followed.

20:55.314 --> 20:57.282
Why yes, Master.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.649
It's for you, Lyra.

21:05.691 --> 21:07.158
What is this?

21:07.192 --> 21:09.126
An alethiometer.

21:09.161 --> 21:13.291
Also known as a golden compass.

21:16.001 --> 21:20.165
It was given to the college
by Lord Asriel many years ago.

21:20.205 --> 21:23.641
And now I'm giving it to you.

21:23.675 --> 21:26.576
I feel you are meant to have it.

21:26.612 --> 21:28.876
What's it for?

21:31.183 --> 21:33.811
It tells the truth.

21:33.852 --> 21:36.218
We've always tried
to acquaint you with the truth.

21:36.255 --> 21:39.224
But the secrets at the heart
of things elude scholars...

21:39.258 --> 21:41.351
and, uh, Authorities.

21:41.393 --> 21:45.159
But this lets you
glimpse things as they are.

21:46.632 --> 21:50.398
But, Lyra,
keep the alethiometer to yourself.

21:50.435 --> 21:51.732
It is of the utmost importance...

21:51.770 --> 21:54.170
that Mrs. Coulter
does not know that you have it.

21:54.206 --> 21:55.230
Do you understand me?

21:55.274 --> 21:57.265
Of the utmost importance.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.213
Lyra. Are you ready?

22:07.085 --> 22:08.552
There's someone missing.

22:08.587 --> 22:10.714
I want to say goodbye to Roger.

22:10.756 --> 22:14.351
Roger? Who's Roger?

22:14.393 --> 22:16.953
My friend.
He works in the kitchens.

22:18.196 --> 22:20.858
We must go.
The ferry's about to take off.

22:22.534 --> 22:24.195
Why don't you write him a letter?

22:24.236 --> 22:26.431
You can tell him
all about the journey, and...

22:26.471 --> 22:28.098
you can even send him a photogram.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.266
- Madam.
- What do you think?

22:29.308 --> 22:31.435
Yeah. I suppose.

23:03.041 --> 23:05.635
- Anything else, madam?
- That'll be all.

23:09.047 --> 23:11.379
Mrs. Coulter, what's that?

23:12.851 --> 23:16.218
That is the Magisterial seat, Lyra.

23:18.156 --> 23:20.716
What's the Magisterium for?

23:20.759 --> 23:23.922
Oh, you have been living
in an ivory tower, haven't you?

23:23.962 --> 23:27.329
The Magisterium
is what people need.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.431
They keep things working
by telling people what to do.

23:32.471 --> 23:36.464
But... you told the Master
you did whatever you pleased.

23:38.610 --> 23:41.670
That's right. Clever girl.

23:41.713 --> 23:45.274
Well, some people know
what's best for them...

23:45.317 --> 23:46.784
and some people don't.

23:47.486 --> 23:49.545
Besides, they don't tell
people what to do...

23:49.588 --> 23:50.850
in a mean, petty way...

23:50.889 --> 23:53.153
they tell them what
to do in a kindly way...

23:53.191 --> 23:55.659
to keep them out of danger.

23:57.162 --> 23:58.459
Sugar?

24:54.152 --> 24:59.283
Look, Pan, it's got
loads of pictures round the edge.

24:59.324 --> 25:01.019
But what do they all mean?

25:01.059 --> 25:02.890
Don't know.

25:04.796 --> 25:08.892
The needle keeps stopping
at the same symbols...

25:08.934 --> 25:10.765
Lady...

25:10.802 --> 25:12.633
lightning bolt...

25:12.671 --> 25:14.798
and the baby.

25:14.840 --> 25:18.139
Then it goes back
and does it again. See?

25:18.176 --> 25:20.872
What do you think
makes the needle move?

25:20.912 --> 25:24.279
I don't know.
Maybe Uncle Asriel knows.

25:26.351 --> 25:28.945
Maybe we're supposed
to take it to him.

25:33.692 --> 25:35.626
All washed and ready for bed?

25:37.629 --> 25:39.392
We have a busy few weeks.

25:57.382 --> 26:00.510
Well, it was
a stylish enough party...

26:00.552 --> 26:03.077
but why they don't offer
more ice with their drinks...

26:03.121 --> 26:04.986
I shall never understand.

26:05.023 --> 26:07.321
I'll only be a moment, darling.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.849
Official business.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.191
What?

26:14.232 --> 26:17.497
She likes to show off
her new pet, doesn't she?

26:17.536 --> 26:20.096
She's never taking us to the North.

26:20.138 --> 26:21.730
We're like prisoners in this house.

26:21.773 --> 26:24.833
All these rules, and rooms
that we aren't allowed into.

26:27.913 --> 26:31.314
Perhaps we shouldn't have
invited Professor Docker.

26:31.349 --> 26:33.180
He's such a bore, isn't he?

26:33.218 --> 26:35.186
And he had sauce in his beard.

26:38.690 --> 26:42.387
But he is one of the foremost
experts on particle metaphysics.

26:43.695 --> 26:45.925
Have I taught you
what a particle is?

26:45.964 --> 26:48.159
Oh, I know about particles.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.360
Like Dust.

26:50.068 --> 26:51.660
That's a particle, isn't it?

26:52.838 --> 26:54.305
Dust?

26:54.339 --> 26:56.466
I mean the Dust from space.

26:56.508 --> 26:58.738
That Dust, like in the North.

26:58.777 --> 27:00.642
Where did you hear about that?

27:02.414 --> 27:04.473
It must have been
one of the scholars at Jordan.

27:10.055 --> 27:11.750
A wise person knows, Lyra...

27:11.790 --> 27:13.985
that there are some things
that we best ignore...

27:14.025 --> 27:18.018
subjects that you...
well, you never speak about.

27:19.431 --> 27:21.592
- But I didn't...
- Yes.

27:21.633 --> 27:24.534
You didn't know, so I forgive you.

27:24.569 --> 27:26.332
Just don't mention it again.

27:28.373 --> 27:29.840
Now, darling...

27:29.875 --> 27:33.003
will you take off that
childish shoulder bag?

27:33.044 --> 27:35.478
I don't like to see you
wearing it indoors.

27:37.849 --> 27:39.714
Please, Mrs. Coulter.

27:40.752 --> 27:42.242
I do love it.

27:43.021 --> 27:44.511
But I do not.

27:48.193 --> 27:49.888
Put it away.

27:53.932 --> 27:56.059
Lyra, put it away now.

27:56.101 --> 27:57.693
I don't want to.

27:59.170 --> 28:00.899
If you do not obey me...

28:00.939 --> 28:02.634
we will have an argument
which I will win.

28:02.674 --> 28:04.574
Now put it away at once.

28:04.609 --> 28:07.305
It's absurd to be carrying
around a shoulder bag...

28:07.345 --> 28:09.313
in your own home.

28:09.347 --> 28:11.212
Jordan is my home.

28:13.585 --> 28:15.314
No! Lyra!

28:16.621 --> 28:19.112
Don't. Please, it hurts!

28:19.157 --> 28:20.419
Lyra!

28:21.459 --> 28:22.585
Lyra!

28:22.627 --> 28:24.117
Will you do as I tell you?

28:24.162 --> 28:25.424
I promise.

28:29.968 --> 28:31.526
Lyra.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.801
Thank you.

28:36.708 --> 28:38.972
And while you're at it, you must
learn to control your dæmon.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.841
He's much too wild.

28:40.879 --> 28:43.109
Now...

28:43.148 --> 28:45.241
Kiss me.

28:48.486 --> 28:49.680
I hate her!

28:51.222 --> 28:53.122
I hate them!

28:53.158 --> 28:54.523
And look.

28:54.559 --> 28:56.356
They're spying on us.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.263
What do they want with us?

29:04.302 --> 29:06.270
Why are we here?

29:06.304 --> 29:07.828
Did you see her dæmon?

29:07.872 --> 29:10.466
He went all sharp
when you mentioned Dust.

29:10.508 --> 29:12.874
And what does she keep
in that room?

29:12.911 --> 29:14.572
Let's go find out.

29:30.295 --> 29:32.889
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

29:39.371 --> 29:41.100
Over here.

29:50.515 --> 29:52.005
Look.

29:57.322 --> 29:59.722
That's just one of
her stupid guest lists.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.089
No, it isn't.

30:01.126 --> 30:02.821
Look at it.

30:07.866 --> 30:09.731
"Inter... cision."

30:10.602 --> 30:12.695
What does it mean, Pan?

30:12.737 --> 30:13.726
And that...

30:13.772 --> 30:17.208
"General... Oblation Board."

30:17.242 --> 30:19.836
G... O... B.

30:21.413 --> 30:23.313
Gobblers.

30:23.348 --> 30:26.476
From the letters, G... O... B.

30:28.553 --> 30:32.785
"Workman, Edwards, Parslow, Costa!"

30:32.824 --> 30:34.291
Billy and Roger!

30:37.395 --> 30:39.886
Pan, it's her.
She's running the Gobblers.

30:39.931 --> 30:41.455
Lyra, where are you?

30:41.499 --> 30:43.126
We have to get out of here.

30:45.603 --> 30:47.400
Lyr...

30:47.439 --> 30:48.770
Lyra.

30:48.807 --> 30:50.274
What have you been doing?

30:50.308 --> 30:51.434
Nothing.

30:51.476 --> 30:53.273
Well, we must find
something for you to do.

30:53.311 --> 30:56.280
Shall you help me
arrange our passage to Norroway?

30:58.283 --> 31:01.719
Oh, you do want to come
to the North with me, don't you?

31:01.753 --> 31:03.914
Where is he? I don't see him.

31:14.132 --> 31:16.327
Lyra, this way!

31:17.869 --> 31:19.894
Quick, Lyra!

31:24.142 --> 31:25.166
Lyra!

31:32.884 --> 31:35.114
What are we gonna do, Pan?

31:35.153 --> 31:38.122
We've got to save Roger...
and Billy.

31:38.156 --> 31:40.021
We've got
to save ourselves first!

31:40.058 --> 31:41.252
Where are we gonna go?

31:41.292 --> 31:43.157
Anywhere's better than here.

31:44.529 --> 31:47.157
Come on! This way!

31:51.769 --> 31:54.135
All right, then.
Split up. The girl can't be far.

31:55.406 --> 31:56.964
Spread out.
Search all the buildings.

31:57.008 --> 31:58.134
Gobblers!

31:58.176 --> 32:00.076
You, cover the canal.

32:02.013 --> 32:04.208
She's gotta be here somewhere.

32:13.024 --> 32:14.491
Wait up, Johnny!

32:14.526 --> 32:16.357
Put your back into it!

32:16.394 --> 32:17.520
We'll need two more of them.

32:18.863 --> 32:22.492
Come on, lovely, lovely
and fresh. Lovely and fresh.

32:22.534 --> 32:26.026
Hurry!

32:29.674 --> 32:31.141
Get her!

32:31.176 --> 32:32.404
Get it!

32:36.047 --> 32:37.571
Pan!

32:37.615 --> 32:39.310
Hurry, Lyra!

32:46.524 --> 32:48.116
Lyra!

32:48.359 --> 32:49.348
Hold her!

32:51.896 --> 32:53.329
No!

33:06.311 --> 33:09.144
- Lyra!
- Pan.

33:09.180 --> 33:11.171
Gyptians.

33:15.853 --> 33:17.582
Don't fret none, Lyra.

33:18.823 --> 33:20.051
Come 'ere.

33:22.493 --> 33:24.484
You're safe with us.

33:24.529 --> 33:26.827
You're Ma Costa.

33:26.864 --> 33:27.922
Billy's mum.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.933
But what are you doing here?

33:30.969 --> 33:32.300
We been in your shadow...

33:32.337 --> 33:35.602
ever since you left
Jordan College, watchin' over you.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.131
And a good thing too.

33:38.176 --> 33:40.201
You best come with us.

33:41.412 --> 33:41.579
Hurry, lads.

33:41.579 --> 33:42.637
Hurry, lads.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.238
Where are we going?

33:44.282 --> 33:47.012
To see Lord Faa,
King of the Gyptians.

33:47.051 --> 33:49.281
Come on, get yourself aboard.

34:35.533 --> 34:37.763
Not very friendly, are they?

34:37.802 --> 34:39.599
What are you lookin' at?

34:45.443 --> 34:47.103
So now all the clans are here...

34:47.145 --> 34:49.875
we'll head North on the next tide.

34:51.683 --> 34:52.809
Ma Costa.

34:54.552 --> 34:56.815
This is the child?

34:58.823 --> 35:01.223
It's all right.

35:05.129 --> 35:06.494
How do you do, Lord Faa?

35:10.101 --> 35:11.864
Hello, Lyra.

35:13.371 --> 35:15.168
You come and sit by my side.

35:15.206 --> 35:16.264
Right, boys, get your heads up!

35:17.442 --> 35:19.603
This is Farder Coram.

35:19.644 --> 35:21.635
Head for the ice lake!

35:21.679 --> 35:25.638
And these are the chiefs
of the Gyptian families.

35:25.683 --> 35:29.141
You are our guest here,
and you're under our protection.

35:30.054 --> 35:31.351
Lord Faa...

35:32.457 --> 35:33.856
I want to thank you.

35:33.891 --> 35:36.621
For keeping watch on me and all.

35:36.661 --> 35:38.959
But why did you do it?

35:38.996 --> 35:42.261
Lord Asriel has been
a good friend to the Gyptians...

35:42.300 --> 35:46.703
this many a year, and this many
a year it has been our charge...

35:46.738 --> 35:50.572
to bring him news of you
as we travel along our ways.

35:51.642 --> 35:53.769
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

35:55.079 --> 36:00.449
And when Mrs. Coulter
got a hold of you, well...

36:00.485 --> 36:03.784
we suspected that she had
something to do with the Gobblers.

36:03.821 --> 36:06.346
And she did.

36:06.391 --> 36:09.758
She and them Gobblers
took my little boy Billy.

36:11.229 --> 36:13.129
Lyra.

36:13.164 --> 36:15.428
We know your tale
all the way up until...

36:15.466 --> 36:18.435
you run away
and the Costas found you.

36:18.469 --> 36:21.961
But is there anything else
you can tell us?

36:22.006 --> 36:24.907
Is there anything
you may have forgot?

36:25.877 --> 36:27.572
Don't show it to them.

36:29.580 --> 36:32.014
The Master of Jordan gave me this.

36:34.385 --> 36:38.116
I thought they was
all taken by the Magisterium.

36:43.361 --> 36:45.226
It's an alethiometer.

36:45.263 --> 36:47.288
It's a truth measurer.

36:47.331 --> 36:49.731
A golden compass.

36:49.767 --> 36:54.397
It enables you to see
what others wish to hide.

36:54.439 --> 36:58.341
You got three hands
you can control.

36:58.376 --> 37:01.834
By pointing at three symbols...

37:01.879 --> 37:05.508
you can ask any sort of question
you can imagine.

37:06.984 --> 37:09.179
Once you got your question framed...

37:09.220 --> 37:12.451
this blue needle points
to more symbols...

37:12.490 --> 37:14.424
that give you the answer.

37:14.459 --> 37:17.019
Could it be used
to find the missing children?

37:17.061 --> 37:18.585
Not by me.

37:18.629 --> 37:20.460
The art was jealously guarded.

37:20.498 --> 37:21.487
Can I try?

37:24.802 --> 37:25.791
All right.

37:25.837 --> 37:27.327
What are you doing, Lyra?

37:27.371 --> 37:28.668
You don't know how to read it.

37:28.706 --> 37:30.401
Hush, Pan.

37:32.410 --> 37:37.541
Well, the serpent is cunning,
like the Gobblers.

37:37.582 --> 37:41.211
And... the pot could mean
a recipe or a plan.

37:41.252 --> 37:43.117
And...

37:43.154 --> 37:44.621
the baby...

37:44.655 --> 37:47.180
that means kids.

37:47.225 --> 37:49.022
One thing I do know, Lyra...

37:49.060 --> 37:52.257
you mustn't grasp at the answer.

37:52.296 --> 37:55.993
Hold the question
in your mind, but lightly.

37:56.033 --> 37:58.627
Like it was something alive.

38:28.599 --> 38:31.090
It's an hourglass.

38:31.135 --> 38:34.332
But it came round to it
on the second time.

38:34.372 --> 38:37.773
The first time it only
stopped there a moment.

38:38.943 --> 38:41.878
On top of the hourglass...

38:41.913 --> 38:43.642
there's a skull.

38:50.221 --> 38:53.088
Thank you, children.
Finish your letters now.

39:01.766 --> 39:05.759
Billy Costa,
why didn't you write anything?

39:05.803 --> 39:07.634
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

39:09.173 --> 39:12.233
I don't know what to put
in the letter, miss.

39:12.276 --> 39:14.107
You haven't told us
what we're here for.

39:14.145 --> 39:16.443
You're here to help us.

39:16.480 --> 39:20.075
And just as soon as you've helped us,
we'll send you back home.

39:21.085 --> 39:22.712
That's what you should write.

39:22.753 --> 39:25.313
Or don't they teach
Gyptian children to write?

39:26.123 --> 39:28.956
They teach us
to write the truth, miss.

39:29.994 --> 39:32.724
Billy, just write the letter.

39:32.763 --> 39:36.824
Well, as I'll be posting
these straight away...

39:36.867 --> 39:39.529
I'm afraid your parents
will be disappointed.

39:47.612 --> 39:51.810
I confess I am puzzled
by your interest in the Belacqua girl.

39:51.849 --> 39:55.341
For one thing, she is
in possession of the alethiometer.

39:55.386 --> 39:58.184
How...? Ah, yes. The Master.

40:01.492 --> 40:02.652
Can she read it?

40:03.194 --> 40:05.389
Of course not.

40:05.429 --> 40:07.363
Mrs. Coulter...

40:07.398 --> 40:10.094
are you familiar with
the prophesies of the witches?

40:10.134 --> 40:12.694
You think she is that child?

40:13.671 --> 40:14.660
Impossible.

40:15.906 --> 40:18.204
Nonetheless, she must be found.

40:26.083 --> 40:28.517
They'll seek her out
like bees to honey.

41:01.719 --> 41:03.311
Svalbard.

41:04.789 --> 41:06.586
Kingdom of the ice bears.

41:09.627 --> 41:12.721
We shall have
to watch ourselves, Stelmaria.

41:12.763 --> 41:14.230
You can bet
that Coulter woman has hired...

41:14.265 --> 41:17.962
every Samoyed bandit from here
to the Pole to hunt us down.

42:26.103 --> 42:27.730
Let's not be so hasty.

42:27.772 --> 42:29.000
Why don't we just...

42:29.039 --> 42:31.007
We can work this out
like gentlemen.

43:01.038 --> 43:02.835
Don't worry, Lyra.

43:02.873 --> 43:04.534
We'll find Roger.

43:37.641 --> 43:39.199
I'm all right.

43:41.378 --> 43:42.743
What is it?

43:42.780 --> 43:44.475
It's a spy-fly.

43:44.515 --> 43:45.982
Is it dangerous?

43:47.351 --> 43:50.081
The one that got away is.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.452
If you was to crack it open...

43:52.489 --> 43:55.049
you'd find no living thing in there.

43:55.092 --> 43:57.560
No animal or insect, at any rate.

43:57.595 --> 43:59.529
There's a clockwork...

43:59.563 --> 44:03.431
and pinned to the spring of it
is a bad spirit...

44:03.467 --> 44:06.231
with a sleeping poison in its sting.

44:07.471 --> 44:10.201
We'll keep him safe in here.

44:11.542 --> 44:14.033
What was it after?

44:14.078 --> 44:16.046
- You, Lyra.
- Why me?

44:16.080 --> 44:17.877
Why are they doing this?

44:17.915 --> 44:19.678
We don't know.

44:19.717 --> 44:21.514
But we Gyptians...

44:21.552 --> 44:25.283
have been hurt worse than most
by these Gobblers...

44:25.322 --> 44:28.223
these child-thieves.

44:28.259 --> 44:30.750
They're takin' those children up North...

44:30.794 --> 44:33.922
the land of cold and dark...

44:33.964 --> 44:37.593
and what they're doing
with them there, we don't know...

44:37.635 --> 44:40.399
but we have heard terrible rumor.

44:42.439 --> 44:44.270
Our aim...

44:44.308 --> 44:48.039
is first to go North
and to rescue these children...

44:48.078 --> 44:51.411
both Gyptian and landloper alike.

44:54.551 --> 44:58.749
But if they have been harmed...

44:58.789 --> 45:00.848
I promise you...

45:00.891 --> 45:03.758
if they have been harmed...

45:03.794 --> 45:08.288
there is not a place
nor on land nor on sea...

45:08.332 --> 45:10.095
for these Gobblers.

45:10.134 --> 45:13.103
And when the time comes to punish...

45:13.137 --> 45:19.269
we will strike such a blow as'll make
their hearts faint and fearful.

45:19.310 --> 45:20.334
Yes!

45:20.377 --> 45:23.835
We will strike the strength
out of them.

45:23.881 --> 45:28.648
We will leave them
broken and shattered.

45:28.686 --> 45:29.744
Yes!

45:46.470 --> 45:48.438
Are you getting scared, Pan?

45:48.472 --> 45:50.269
Scared?

45:50.307 --> 45:51.797
A little.

45:53.143 --> 45:55.839
It's all bigger and scarier
than we ever thought.

45:55.879 --> 45:59.042
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

45:59.083 --> 46:02.644
But we've got to, though, ain't we?

46:02.686 --> 46:04.517
Go on, I mean.

46:12.529 --> 46:14.394
Who are you?

46:15.466 --> 46:17.764
My name is Serafina Pekkala...

46:17.801 --> 46:20.599
clan-queen of the witches
of Lake Enara.

46:20.637 --> 46:21.968
A witch?

46:22.006 --> 46:23.997
Where's your dæmon?

46:24.041 --> 46:27.067
Kaisa can fly a long way from me.

46:28.412 --> 46:30.642
Are you the girl
the Magisterium seeks?

46:30.681 --> 46:32.649
The one with a symbol reader?

46:37.755 --> 46:39.586
Let me see you read it.

46:39.623 --> 46:41.818
I want to know
if you can tell me...

46:41.859 --> 46:45.192
which of the men
on this ship was once...

46:45.229 --> 46:46.662
my lover.

47:15.592 --> 47:16.889
Farder Coram?

47:17.928 --> 47:19.156
But...

47:19.196 --> 47:21.790
He was young and beautiful once.

47:21.832 --> 47:25.199
And we witches live
for hundreds of years.

47:25.235 --> 47:27.066
Farder Coram wishes to know...

47:27.104 --> 47:29.572
where the child-cutters
take their prey.

47:29.606 --> 47:32.234
It is a place...

47:32.276 --> 47:34.471
they call Bolvangar.

47:34.511 --> 47:36.240
The place of fear.

47:36.280 --> 47:40.046
A regiment of Tartars
with wolf dæmons guards it.

47:40.084 --> 47:42.211
Birds do not fly above.

47:42.252 --> 47:43.719
Animals have fled.

47:43.754 --> 47:46.382
Even the Samoyeds fear it.

47:47.925 --> 47:51.918
It is a week's march from Trollesund,
on the coast of Norroway.

47:51.962 --> 47:54.988
You will find something
to help you in Trollesund.

47:55.032 --> 47:57.296
You will need all your courage.

47:59.336 --> 48:02.066
I'm glad I've lived long enough
to see you...

48:03.207 --> 48:04.902
child.

48:44.748 --> 48:47.273
Who's going to help us?

48:47.317 --> 48:49.342
Can you see anything?

48:49.386 --> 48:51.911
Lyra, you're not listening to me.

49:04.201 --> 49:06.829
That's a mighty fancy
clockwork you got there.

49:09.306 --> 49:11.001
It's just a toy.

49:12.809 --> 49:15.334
Well, then,
it's a mighty fancy toy.

49:19.249 --> 49:21.149
How'd you come by somethin' like that?

49:21.185 --> 49:25.383
Oh, Lord. Lee, when you gonna learn
to mind your own business?

49:26.423 --> 49:28.220
I do beg pardon.

49:28.258 --> 49:29.919
Lee Scoresby.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.552
And this old gal is Hester.

49:32.930 --> 49:35.364
I'm Lyra. And this is Pan.

49:35.399 --> 49:36.730
Pantalaimon.

49:36.767 --> 49:39.429
- Howdy.
- Mighty pleased, Miss Lyra.

49:40.504 --> 49:43.996
You rode in with them Gyptian fellers.
Am I right?

49:44.041 --> 49:46.168
- Whoa, boy.
- There I go again.

49:46.210 --> 49:47.575
Don't answer that.

49:47.611 --> 49:51.103
What are you doing
in Trollesund, Mr. Scoresby?

49:51.148 --> 49:54.675
Oh, a friend of mine
got himself in a fix.

49:54.718 --> 49:57.016
So I come to see
what I could do about it.

49:57.054 --> 49:58.521
Me too.

49:58.555 --> 50:00.785
Course, that ain't
my normal occupation.

50:00.824 --> 50:05.158
Most of the time,
I ply my trade up in the sky.

50:06.230 --> 50:07.697
You're an aeronaut!

50:09.233 --> 50:11.133
Can I go up in your ship?

50:11.168 --> 50:13.363
I'd be honored.

50:13.403 --> 50:15.394
Just as soon as
I get her out of hock.

50:17.708 --> 50:19.141
Miss Lyra...

50:20.210 --> 50:22.371
I'd like to give you
a word of advice...

50:22.412 --> 50:25.006
though you ain't asked for none.

50:25.048 --> 50:27.812
If I was on the kinda... scout...

50:27.851 --> 50:30.376
that I reckon you're on...

50:30.420 --> 50:33.685
I'd hire myself an aeronaut...

50:33.724 --> 50:35.316
and an armoured bear.

50:35.359 --> 50:37.486
An armoured bear?

50:37.527 --> 50:40.018
There's one in town.

50:40.063 --> 50:42.395
Iorek Byrnison's his name.

50:42.432 --> 50:45.959
Works at the sled depot
behind Einarsson's Bar.

50:46.003 --> 50:48.733
Good one to have
on your side in a scrap.

50:49.873 --> 50:51.704
Not that you're lookin' for that.

51:03.186 --> 51:06.815
Iorek Byrnison? Iorek Byrnison?

51:06.857 --> 51:10.224
May I speak to you?

51:12.329 --> 51:13.421
What?

51:13.463 --> 51:15.795
We want to offer you employment.

51:15.832 --> 51:20.098
I am employed, by the townspeople.

51:20.137 --> 51:22.662
I mend broken machinery.

51:22.706 --> 51:25.698
I lift heavy objects.

51:25.742 --> 51:29.200
What kind of work is that
for a Panserbjørn?

51:31.281 --> 51:32.976
Paid work!

51:54.071 --> 51:56.266
Is that what they pay you?

51:56.306 --> 51:57.637
Whisky?

51:59.242 --> 52:00.573
Iorek Byrnison...

52:00.610 --> 52:03.807
you're the first ice bear I ever met.

52:05.048 --> 52:07.516
I was ever so excited,
and scared.

52:08.719 --> 52:10.983
But now I'm just disappointed.

52:11.021 --> 52:13.819
I heard that bears
lived to hunt and to fight.

52:14.925 --> 52:16.984
Why are you
wasting your time here...

52:17.027 --> 52:18.517
drinking whisky?

52:20.330 --> 52:24.323
I stay because
the people of this town...

52:24.368 --> 52:25.926
gave me spirits...

52:25.969 --> 52:28.733
and let me drink till I was asleep.

52:28.772 --> 52:31.605
Then they took my armour away.

52:31.641 --> 52:34.838
And without my armour,
I cannot go to war.

52:34.878 --> 52:38.814
And I am an armoured bear.

52:38.849 --> 52:42.285
War is the sea I swim in...

52:42.319 --> 52:45.049
the air I breathe.

52:45.088 --> 52:48.888
Without my armour, I am nothing.

52:48.925 --> 52:52.884
But... can't you make new armour?

52:52.929 --> 52:55.989
I thought bears were good at that.

52:56.032 --> 52:57.897
There's all this metal around.

52:57.934 --> 52:59.902
Worthless!

53:01.671 --> 53:04.765
My armour is made of sky iron...

53:04.808 --> 53:08.801
from the falling stars
that land in Svalbard.

53:08.845 --> 53:12.281
A bear's armour is his soul...

53:12.315 --> 53:15.307
as your dæmon is your soul.

53:15.352 --> 53:16.910
Irreplaceable.

53:16.953 --> 53:20.514
You may as well take him away
and replace him with a doll.

53:22.259 --> 53:25.592
It must have been terrible
to lose your armour.

53:25.629 --> 53:28.564
It was no less than I deserved.

53:29.733 --> 53:31.598
I am an exile.

53:31.635 --> 53:36.629
I was sent away from Svalbard
because I was unworthy.

53:36.673 --> 53:40.006
I fought another bear
in single combat...

53:40.043 --> 53:42.739
and was defeated.

53:51.188 --> 53:53.622
- Come, child.
- But Farder Coram...

53:53.657 --> 53:55.750
We can't involve ourselves.

54:25.589 --> 54:27.557
He was a prince.

54:29.326 --> 54:32.784
He would have been a king
if the other bear hadn't defeated him.

54:32.829 --> 54:35.024
He lost everything.

54:35.065 --> 54:37.863
Oh, Pan, they've really hurt him.

54:41.238 --> 54:44.867
Iorek Byrnison? Iorek Byrnison.

54:46.243 --> 54:49.337
- Be careful.
- I know where your armour is.

54:51.848 --> 54:54.146
They tricked you out of it.

54:54.184 --> 54:56.152
They shouldn't have done that,
lorek Byrnison.

54:56.186 --> 55:00.555
It's in the district office
of the Magisterium.

55:00.590 --> 55:03.024
Right here in Trollesund.

55:03.059 --> 55:05.755
What is your name, child?

55:05.795 --> 55:07.558
Lyra Belacqua.

55:07.597 --> 55:11.158
Then, Lyra Belacqua...

55:11.201 --> 55:13.669
I owe you a debt.

55:13.703 --> 55:16.433
I will serve you in your campaign...

55:16.473 --> 55:18.600
until I am dead...

55:18.642 --> 55:21.873
or you have a victory.

56:17.634 --> 56:18.965
Iorek!

56:20.070 --> 56:22.561
Iorek Byrnison!

56:22.606 --> 56:26.064
Iorek, listen.
Don't fight these men.

56:26.109 --> 56:28.236
What they done ain't right, I know.

56:28.278 --> 56:30.303
But if you fight, you'll kill them.

56:30.347 --> 56:31.712
And there'll be more fighting...

56:31.748 --> 56:33.682
and we'll never get away
to rescue those kids.

56:39.489 --> 56:41.889
Let's not be too hasty.

56:41.925 --> 56:45.258
Way I see it,
there's no need for a dust-up.

56:46.930 --> 56:50.331
Howdy, lorek.
I was down South.

56:50.367 --> 56:53.268
Heard you ran into
a little local trouble.

56:53.303 --> 56:56.704
Didn't have the first notion
on how to spring ya.

56:56.740 --> 56:58.230
Fortunately, little girls...

56:58.274 --> 57:00.504
come in real resourceful
up in these parts.

57:03.780 --> 57:07.011
Well, looky here. Reinforcements.

57:08.885 --> 57:12.048
What do you say you fellers
just call it a day?

57:16.192 --> 57:19.218
Just been hired on
by these gentlemen...

57:19.262 --> 57:22.197
of the Gyptian persuasion.

57:22.232 --> 57:24.723
You figurin' on joining
this turkey shoot?

57:24.768 --> 57:28.329
Yes. I have a contract
with the child.

57:31.074 --> 57:33.907
That's some pretty
fast work, Miss Lyra.

57:56.232 --> 57:58.223
My lord.

58:00.970 --> 58:04.064
Rise, Fra Pavel.

58:04.107 --> 58:05.904
I have received your news...

58:05.942 --> 58:10.345
about the Gyptian party
heading to the North.

58:10.380 --> 58:12.507
The matter is of
the first importance.

58:12.549 --> 58:15.916
They must be eliminated,
and Bolvangar protected.

58:17.353 --> 58:21.517
The intercision process is
more important than ever.

58:21.558 --> 58:24.391
Which is why it must be
taken out of the hands...

58:24.427 --> 58:26.725
of the Coulter woman.

58:30.567 --> 58:35.027
It was Mrs. Coulter
who took the Belacqua child...

58:35.071 --> 58:37.733
from Jordan College
and then let her slip away.

58:37.774 --> 58:40.766
Yes, that is
the most troubling of all.

58:42.011 --> 58:45.242
No matter.
One way or another...

58:45.281 --> 58:47.681
it's better that I've sent
Mrs. Coulter after the child.

58:47.717 --> 58:50.049
- You've sent her?
- Yes.

58:50.086 --> 58:52.452
She is to demonstrate
the improvements...

58:52.489 --> 58:56.357
to the intercision process
upon the Belacqua girl.

59:20.416 --> 59:23.146
I'm sorry.

59:29.859 --> 59:32.419
I would never hurt you.

59:38.535 --> 59:40.526
Oh, Lyra.

59:42.772 --> 59:45.366
I'll find you.

59:45.408 --> 59:48.172
I will find you.

01:00:04.727 --> 01:00:07.252
Careful now, boys.

01:00:07.297 --> 01:00:10.858
Airship machinery's kind of finicky.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.358
I want to die in a rocking chair,
not a hydrogen fire.

01:00:14.404 --> 01:00:16.872
And she was ever so clever,
Mrs. Coulter...

01:00:16.906 --> 01:00:18.897
but she was always
telling me what to do.

01:00:18.942 --> 01:00:20.967
I don't like people
telling me what to do.

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:23.672
I bet you don't like it either.
I can tell.

01:00:23.713 --> 01:00:25.681
You're like my Uncle Asriel.

01:00:25.715 --> 01:00:28.809
He's a rough noble like you.
That's what I think.

01:00:35.992 --> 01:00:38.893
Samoyed lands.

01:00:38.928 --> 01:00:42.523
Samoyeds don't take
kindly to trespassers.

01:00:42.565 --> 01:00:45.659
It's the only way
to reach Bolvangar.

01:00:47.737 --> 01:00:50.797
Stay close to me.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.866
- Come, child.
- It will be dark soon.

01:01:02.919 --> 01:01:05.387
How far do you reckon?

01:01:05.421 --> 01:01:08.083
Oh, I don't know for sure,
but a good few miles.

01:01:08.124 --> 01:01:10.854
We covered some ground.

01:01:32.815 --> 01:01:36.216
What's wrong?
What can you see?

01:01:42.191 --> 01:01:44.056
- Where are we going?
- Hush, Pan.

01:01:44.093 --> 01:01:45.993
They told us not to leave the tent.

01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:47.326
Is he coming, then?

01:01:47.363 --> 01:01:50.628
Don't know. I'll have a look.

01:02:06.516 --> 01:02:07.778
Iorek?

01:02:07.817 --> 01:02:10.752
What is it, child?

01:02:10.787 --> 01:02:14.018
The alethiometer keeps
telling me something.

01:02:14.057 --> 01:02:17.584
In the next valley,
there's a lake with a house by it...

01:02:17.627 --> 01:02:19.891
and it's troubled by a ghost.

01:02:19.929 --> 01:02:23.421
It's something to do
with the Gobblers and Roger.

01:02:23.466 --> 01:02:27.095
You could take me there,
couldn't you?

01:02:27.136 --> 01:02:29.036
You could carry me
there and back...

01:02:29.072 --> 01:02:30.903
before anyone knew,
couldn't you?

01:02:31.774 --> 01:02:35.266
You wish to ride me?

01:02:35.311 --> 01:02:37.245
Yeah.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.408
We will travel faster without armour.

01:03:15.251 --> 01:03:17.446
Are those birds?

01:03:17.487 --> 01:03:19.148
Witches.

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:22.917
More than I have ever seen.

01:03:22.959 --> 01:03:24.950
Where are they going?

01:03:24.994 --> 01:03:27.792
Flying to war.

01:03:29.065 --> 01:03:31.158
If they are flying
to the aid of your enemies...

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.430
you should all be afraid.

01:03:34.137 --> 01:03:35.832
Are you afraid?

01:03:35.872 --> 01:03:37.669
No.

01:03:37.707 --> 01:03:41.370
When I am, I will master my fear.

01:04:09.739 --> 01:04:12.299
I will make sure the way is clear.

01:04:12.341 --> 01:04:15.003
No. Stay here.

01:04:36.866 --> 01:04:39.596
Lyra, no, please don't.

01:04:39.635 --> 01:04:41.603
Something's wrong.

01:04:41.637 --> 01:04:45.095
- Hush, Pan.
- Something terrible.

01:04:45.141 --> 01:04:47.575
I'm afraid.

01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:50.170
We've got to master our fear.

01:05:12.001 --> 01:05:14.196
Hello?

01:05:14.237 --> 01:05:16.228
Hello?

01:05:40.596 --> 01:05:42.826
Billy.

01:05:42.865 --> 01:05:45.231
Where's his dæmon?

01:05:45.268 --> 01:05:48.032
He doesn't have a dæmon.

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.935
That's...

01:05:49.972 --> 01:05:51.633
intercision.

01:05:53.476 --> 01:05:56.240
That's what
the Gobblers are doing...

01:05:58.748 --> 01:06:01.308
cuttin' away kids' dæmons.

01:06:02.685 --> 01:06:04.585
Where's my Ratter?

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.645
Have you seen her?

01:06:08.724 --> 01:06:10.692
Billy, it's me, Lyra.

01:06:10.726 --> 01:06:13.695
Let me take you
back to your mum.

01:06:13.729 --> 01:06:15.788
I need Ratter.

01:06:15.831 --> 01:06:18.493
Billy, come on with me.

01:06:18.534 --> 01:06:20.661
We'll take you someplace safe.

01:06:20.703 --> 01:06:22.364
We'll find Ratter.

01:06:39.055 --> 01:06:41.523
Gracious God, what's this?

01:06:43.926 --> 01:06:47.487
Lyra, child,
what have you found?

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:51.193
Billy. Billy Costa.

01:06:51.234 --> 01:06:52.667
Billy!

01:06:55.905 --> 01:06:58.066
Oh, Billy!
You're all right, Billy.

01:06:58.107 --> 01:07:00.337
You're safe now.

01:07:01.244 --> 01:07:02.472
We'll find your dæmon.

01:07:02.511 --> 01:07:05.344
We'll bring 'er back.

01:07:21.297 --> 01:07:25.199
Here, take Lyra.
Gyptians, to arms!

01:07:34.443 --> 01:07:36.308
- Watch your backs!
- Protect the children!

01:07:49.392 --> 01:07:51.087
Look out, Lyra!

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:03.131
Iorek!

01:08:03.506 --> 01:08:06.270
Iorek Byrnison, help me!

01:08:24.527 --> 01:08:27.154
Pan, where are they taking us?

01:08:27.196 --> 01:08:29.163
I don't know.
We've been going for hours.

01:08:42.778 --> 01:08:44.746
Ice bears, Pan.

01:08:46.816 --> 01:08:48.977
I hope you're happy now.

01:09:03.466 --> 01:09:06.264
You're losing your touch, <i>amigo.</i>

01:09:07.103 --> 01:09:08.593
So am I.

01:09:08.636 --> 01:09:11.037
Don't worry.

01:09:11.073 --> 01:09:12.768
We'll get her back.

01:09:14.042 --> 01:09:17.444
The Samoyeds
won't lay a hand on her.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.913
She's worth more in one piece.

01:09:23.386 --> 01:09:25.581
I'll find her.

01:09:25.621 --> 01:09:29.113
I'll bring her back.
I can bargain with Ragnar.

01:09:30.693 --> 01:09:33.957
I'll drop you at the border,
pick you up on the way out.

01:09:33.996 --> 01:09:36.965
No. I will not leave her.

01:09:39.502 --> 01:09:41.560
You show up in Svalbard...

01:09:41.604 --> 01:09:43.595
Ragnar and the rest of 'em
will tear you to pieces.

01:09:43.639 --> 01:09:45.197
You know that.

01:09:45.241 --> 01:09:47.265
I know I would feel ashamed...

01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:50.005
to show less courage
than that child.

01:09:50.045 --> 01:09:53.071
That kind of courage
could get you killed.

01:09:53.115 --> 01:09:57.347
I will not live in shame
any longer, Scoresby.

01:09:58.854 --> 01:10:00.515
No.

01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:03.782
I reckon not.

01:10:05.027 --> 01:10:07.928
I'm gonna take her down,
pick up the trail.

01:10:16.105 --> 01:10:18.073
Don't worry. Iorek will come.

01:10:18.107 --> 01:10:23.170
That's just it, Pan.
There's too many of them for him to fight.

01:10:28.484 --> 01:10:30.577
We've got to do something.

01:10:34.256 --> 01:10:38.693
Do you remember
what Mrs. Coulter said back at Jordan...

01:10:38.727 --> 01:10:41.855
about the king of the bears
wanting a dæmon?

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.262
Pan, I need you to hide.

01:10:47.303 --> 01:10:50.602
- Don't let them see you.
- That's fine with me.

01:10:50.639 --> 01:10:53.369
We can beat him, Pan.

01:11:05.054 --> 01:11:08.148
What is this little thing?

01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:12.586
Our greetings to you, great king.

01:11:12.628 --> 01:11:16.655
Or rather, my greetings and not his.

01:11:16.699 --> 01:11:18.894
Not whose?

01:11:18.934 --> 01:11:21.732
Iorek Byrnison's, Your Majesty.

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:26.298
What have you
to do with lorek Byrnison?

01:11:29.478 --> 01:11:31.912
I am lorek Byrnison's dæmon.

01:11:35.184 --> 01:11:37.584
And how has the exile...

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:41.351
the unworthy lorek Byrnison,
obtained a dæmon?

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:44.416
Iorek Byrnison was
the first bear to get a dæmon...

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.189
but it should've been you.

01:11:46.228 --> 01:11:50.028
They gave me to him at Bolvangar.
Mrs. Coulter did.

01:11:50.065 --> 01:11:53.762
And how could you be
so far from him?

01:11:53.802 --> 01:11:56.270
I'm like a witch's dæmon, great king.

01:11:56.305 --> 01:12:00.036
- I can go as far from him as I please.
- Well...

01:12:00.075 --> 01:12:02.009
if you are his dæmon...

01:12:02.044 --> 01:12:06.003
then I will kill you right now
and be free of an enemy.

01:12:06.048 --> 01:12:08.608
If you do that,
I can never be your dæmon.

01:12:09.552 --> 01:12:12.112
My... dæmon?

01:12:12.154 --> 01:12:14.486
That's why I come here, see?

01:12:14.523 --> 01:12:16.991
'Cause I want to be
your dæmon, not his.

01:12:17.026 --> 01:12:20.018
He's just an exile, nothing.

01:12:20.062 --> 01:12:23.589
But you, you're powerful
and clever and rich...

01:12:23.632 --> 01:12:26.829
and better in every way.

01:12:26.869 --> 01:12:29.895
He's on his way here now,
to fight you.

01:12:29.939 --> 01:12:32.772
What? He's mad.

01:12:32.808 --> 01:12:35.299
- We shall destroy him!
- No.

01:12:35.344 --> 01:12:36.834
No.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.811
If you defeat him,
I will become your dæmon.

01:12:40.849 --> 01:12:43.579
But you must defeat him
in single combat.

01:12:43.619 --> 01:12:47.555
Then all his strength
will flow into yours...

01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:51.924
and my mind will flow
into your mind.

01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:54.395
You and me, together.

01:12:56.465 --> 01:12:58.899
Have him killed any other way...

01:12:58.934 --> 01:13:02.062
and I'll just go out like a light,
and you'll never have a dæmon.

01:13:02.104 --> 01:13:04.402
Prove it.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.705
Prove to me that you are a dæmon.

01:13:07.743 --> 01:13:10.303
Ask me something only you know.

01:13:13.349 --> 01:13:15.909
How did I become king?

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.151
What is that?

01:13:27.196 --> 01:13:29.562
It's a dæmon mirror, great king.

01:13:29.598 --> 01:13:33.398
We dæmons use it to see
the truth in our own eyes.

01:13:55.057 --> 01:13:58.788
Truly you are great
and powerful, Ragnar...

01:13:58.827 --> 01:14:01.295
for you poisoned the old king...

01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:04.857
then challenged the heir to the throne
and beat him in single combat.

01:14:07.403 --> 01:14:09.633
Iorek Byrnison.

01:14:31.727 --> 01:14:33.888
Oh, Pan, what have I done?

01:14:33.929 --> 01:14:35.658
Ragnar's too strong.

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:43.597
So here he is.

01:14:43.639 --> 01:14:46.335
But what if the coward
dare not fight me?

01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:49.310
Great king, let me speak to him.

01:14:49.344 --> 01:14:51.972
- If I do, he will not suspect.
- Very well.

01:14:52.014 --> 01:14:54.710
You go to him. Give him courage.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:57.310
Bring him to his death.

01:14:57.352 --> 01:15:00.253
Soon you'll be mine.

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:14.431
Oh, lorek.

01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:17.200
Iorek, dear,
I've done a terrible thing.

01:15:17.239 --> 01:15:20.675
What terrible thing?

01:15:22.811 --> 01:15:26.303
I told the king I was your dæmon
and that he must fight you.

01:15:26.348 --> 01:15:28.316
If not, they would never let you fight.

01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:30.375
They would burn you
before you even got up close.

01:15:31.587 --> 01:15:33.179
But you've been fighting...

01:15:33.222 --> 01:15:35.053
and running all this way.

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:38.958
Lyra. Lyra Belacqua.

01:15:38.994 --> 01:15:43.328
No, I shall call you
Lyra Silvertongue.

01:15:43.365 --> 01:15:47.028
To fight him is all I want.

01:15:47.069 --> 01:15:50.061
Come, little dæmon.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.248
Fight well, lorek, my dear.

01:16:00.282 --> 01:16:02.546
You're the real king,
and he ain't nothing.

01:16:02.584 --> 01:16:05.781
Lyra, if I am killed...

01:16:05.821 --> 01:16:07.914
Scoresby will find you.

01:17:50.893 --> 01:17:53.225
Is that all...

01:17:53.262 --> 01:17:54.820
whimpering cub?

01:17:54.863 --> 01:17:56.956
Is that all...

01:17:56.999 --> 01:17:58.626
soon-to-die?

01:18:00.736 --> 01:18:04.331
Is that all? Huh?

01:18:14.116 --> 01:18:16.346
Is that all?

01:18:37.973 --> 01:18:40.840
Yes, that is all.

01:18:40.876 --> 01:18:43.811
That is all.

01:18:43.845 --> 01:18:49.511
Bears, who is your king?

01:19:05.567 --> 01:19:07.398
Iorek...

01:19:07.436 --> 01:19:10.030
Iorek, I thought I'd lost you.

01:19:10.072 --> 01:19:11.596
Why?

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.302
You still own my contract.

01:19:17.045 --> 01:19:20.310
And now I will take you to Bolvangar.

01:19:24.653 --> 01:19:26.518
We've got to stop them, lorek.

01:19:26.555 --> 01:19:28.648
The alethiometer says
they'll hurt Roger.

01:19:52.481 --> 01:19:53.948
There.

01:20:11.566 --> 01:20:13.898
It may not hold us both.

01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:17.365
You cross on your own.
I will follow.

01:20:26.915 --> 01:20:29.611
I'm right here. Step quickly.

01:20:29.651 --> 01:20:31.642
Don't look down.

01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:51.464
Don't look back!
You're almost there.

01:21:08.123 --> 01:21:09.886
Run, Lyra!

01:21:09.925 --> 01:21:12.223
Run! Run!

01:21:20.235 --> 01:21:23.500
Lyra! I will get
Scoresby and the Gyptians.

01:21:26.775 --> 01:21:28.834
Wait for me there!

01:21:28.877 --> 01:21:31.710
Lyra! Wait!

01:21:44.593 --> 01:21:46.925
I don't like the look of this place.

01:21:52.868 --> 01:21:55.063
Bolvangar.

01:21:55.103 --> 01:21:57.298
Hello, there.

01:21:57.339 --> 01:22:01.241
I got lost in the snow. Where am I?

01:22:01.276 --> 01:22:03.176
No need to worry, my child.

01:22:03.211 --> 01:22:05.111
You're safe now.

01:22:12.988 --> 01:22:14.922
Well, you'd better come inside.

01:22:14.956 --> 01:22:16.890
It's warm and comfortable in here.

01:22:16.925 --> 01:22:20.326
- What's your name?
- Don't tell him who we are.

01:22:21.897 --> 01:22:24.730
Lizzie. Lizzie Brooks.

01:22:27.936 --> 01:22:30.404
What were you doing
so far north, Lizzie?

01:22:30.438 --> 01:22:32.599
That must be an interesting story.

01:22:32.641 --> 01:22:35.667
My dad and uncles,
they took me north.

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:37.678
They're traders.

01:22:37.712 --> 01:22:42.046
Well, you're very lucky
to have found us when you got lost.

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.675
What is this place?

01:22:43.718 --> 01:22:46.209
Oh, you'll like it.

01:22:46.254 --> 01:22:48.779
It's called the Experimental Station.

01:22:48.823 --> 01:22:50.688
What do you do here?

01:22:50.725 --> 01:22:52.659
We help children grow up.

01:22:52.694 --> 01:22:55.959
- Liar.
- You must be hungry, Lizzie. Lucky you.

01:22:55.997 --> 01:22:58.295
Just in time for dinner.

01:23:14.282 --> 01:23:16.512
Can you see him?
Is he here?

01:23:32.033 --> 01:23:33.500
- Lyra, it's them.
- Pan!

01:23:33.535 --> 01:23:35.298
- You found us!
- You're all right!

01:23:35.337 --> 01:23:37.931
You kept your promise!

01:23:49.184 --> 01:23:50.742
I knew you'd come.

01:23:50.785 --> 01:23:52.412
I promised, didn't I?

01:24:00.228 --> 01:24:03.789
Roger, do you know
what they do to the kids here?

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:07.828
They say they're gonna give us
this operation, right?

01:24:07.869 --> 01:24:09.598
Then they'll send us home...

01:24:09.638 --> 01:24:11.435
and we won't have
to worry about Dust.

01:24:12.407 --> 01:24:14.500
But once they call a kid in...

01:24:14.542 --> 01:24:16.237
you'll never see them again.

01:24:16.278 --> 01:24:19.076
They took Billy Costa
away last week...

01:24:19.114 --> 01:24:20.479
and he's still gone.

01:24:20.515 --> 01:24:23.712
Don't worry.
I've got a plan, all right?

01:24:25.754 --> 01:24:29.190
Tell the kids to have
their warm clothes ready.

01:24:29.224 --> 01:24:31.283
I need to be alone someplace.

01:24:32.394 --> 01:24:34.089
But not here.

01:24:37.565 --> 01:24:40.557
They hardly ever use this one,
but be quick.

01:24:57.952 --> 01:25:00.045
Ask it how
we're gonna get out of here.

01:25:03.325 --> 01:25:05.293
But why would it...

01:25:05.327 --> 01:25:07.352
Oh, no. It's them.

01:25:07.395 --> 01:25:08.987
I think you'll be pleased with our progress.

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:12.659
That may be so,
but I am very interested in discovering...

01:25:12.701 --> 01:25:16.193
how several children managed
to wander free from the station.

01:25:18.807 --> 01:25:20.434
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Coulter...

01:25:20.475 --> 01:25:22.966
I hope you'll understand
that the question is moot.

01:25:23.011 --> 01:25:25.707
Any child who escapes
from the facility...

01:25:25.747 --> 01:25:27.840
would not last
very long in the cold.

01:25:27.882 --> 01:25:30.783
We have already recovered
two of the three missing children.

01:25:31.353 --> 01:25:33.014
Were they alive?

01:25:37.659 --> 01:25:39.957
Well, that is unfortunate.

01:25:40.829 --> 01:25:42.694
But enough of that for now.

01:25:42.731 --> 01:25:44.892
I, at least, have some good news.

01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:49.870
We needn't be concerned
with Lord Asriel any longer.

01:25:52.474 --> 01:25:55.500
He has bribed his captors
and set up a secret laboratory...

01:25:55.543 --> 01:25:58.103
in the furthest reaches
of the North.

01:26:00.014 --> 01:26:03.415
The Magisterium soldiers
are on their way.

01:26:03.451 --> 01:26:07.512
He will be arrested for heresy
and sentenced to death.

01:26:07.555 --> 01:26:09.887
Put him to death? Dear me.

01:26:12.894 --> 01:26:15.795
I think I will retire for the evening.

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:17.798
Oh, well, yes, of course.

01:26:17.832 --> 01:26:20.300
The orderlies will show you
to your chambers.

01:26:24.873 --> 01:26:27.205
Wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of her. I tell you that.

01:26:27.242 --> 01:26:29.870
She's positively ghoulish.

01:26:29.911 --> 01:26:32.038
Do you remember
the first experiments...

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.344
when she was so keen
to see them pulled apart?

01:26:34.382 --> 01:26:36.850
Her and that mute of a dæmon.

01:26:36.885 --> 01:26:38.477
- What was that?
- Down there.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.851
- Under the table.
- Quick!

01:26:39.888 --> 01:26:41.822
- Lyra!
- Grab her leg!

01:26:41.856 --> 01:26:42.914
Lyra, they've got me!

01:26:44.626 --> 01:26:45.923
Come here.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.894
- Come on.
- Lyra!

01:26:49.898 --> 01:26:51.695
- You can't!
- Let me go! Get off me!

01:26:51.733 --> 01:26:54.167
You're not allowed!

01:26:55.570 --> 01:26:57.435
Lyra!

01:27:04.045 --> 01:27:05.808
Quickly now. Straight into the chamber.

01:27:05.847 --> 01:27:08.645
Let me go. Iorek Byrnison's gonna kill you.

01:27:08.683 --> 01:27:10.878
- He'll rip your guts out!
- What a...

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:15.747
Don't fret, dear.
It's only a little cut.

01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:19.089
- You'll never keep us apart.
- You want to grow up, don't you?

01:27:19.127 --> 01:27:22.221
- Well, this is how you grow up.
- Stay away from me!

01:27:22.263 --> 01:27:25.323
- You'll never keep us apart!
- Set phase two.

01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:27.425
Never, never!

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.235
No, stop!

01:27:34.275 --> 01:27:36.402
- Lyra!
- Pan!

01:27:36.444 --> 01:27:38.810
- No!
- Never!

01:27:39.647 --> 01:27:42.013
You can't!

01:27:44.452 --> 01:27:46.283
- Don't leave me, Pan.
- No!

01:27:46.321 --> 01:27:48.619
- Stop!
- No! Help me!

01:27:48.656 --> 01:27:50.317
Lyra!

01:27:55.196 --> 01:27:57.289
Lyra!

01:28:26.928 --> 01:28:29.021
Lyra. Darling.

01:28:29.063 --> 01:28:31.054
- Don't. Don't you touch.
- No, no. No, no one will hurt you.

01:28:31.099 --> 01:28:34.227
No one is going to hurt you.
No one is ever...

01:28:34.269 --> 01:28:35.964
ever going to hurt you.

01:28:36.004 --> 01:28:39.804
They did it to Billy...

01:28:39.841 --> 01:28:41.866
and those other kids.

01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:44.606
They cut their dæmons away.

01:28:44.646 --> 01:28:47.706
Why? Why are they doing that?

01:28:47.749 --> 01:28:51.685
I know it's difficult to understand,
but it's for their own good.

01:28:51.719 --> 01:28:53.846
It's just a little cut.

01:28:53.888 --> 01:28:57.824
You listen. Listen to me.

01:28:57.859 --> 01:29:00.225
A long, long time ago...

01:29:00.261 --> 01:29:02.752
some of our ancestors made...

01:29:02.797 --> 01:29:05.095
made a terrible mistake.

01:29:05.133 --> 01:29:07.829
They disobeyed...

01:29:07.869 --> 01:29:10.064
the Authority.

01:29:10.104 --> 01:29:13.335
And that is what made Dust
come into the world.

01:29:13.374 --> 01:29:17.140
And ever since then, we have been sick
with it, we have been sick with Dust.

01:29:17.178 --> 01:29:19.442
But there is a way out.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.142
You see, Dust doesn't settle
on innocent children.

01:29:23.484 --> 01:29:27.818
It's later, when your dæmon
begins to settle...

01:29:27.855 --> 01:29:30.585
that Dust begins
to swarm all around us...

01:29:30.625 --> 01:29:34.186
trying to work its mischief.

01:29:34.228 --> 01:29:37.595
And that is how children begin to have
all sorts of nasty thoughts...

01:29:37.632 --> 01:29:40.157
and unhappy feelings and...

01:29:41.769 --> 01:29:44.169
But there is a way to stop it.

01:29:45.573 --> 01:29:49.168
A little cut, and gone forever.

01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:52.543
Well, if it's so good,
then why don't you do it yourself?

01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:54.411
Why didn't you let them do it to me?

01:29:56.884 --> 01:30:00.012
I'm going to tell you something.

01:30:00.054 --> 01:30:03.319
Something very important,
something you don't know.

01:30:03.358 --> 01:30:05.849
Intercision isn't perfect yet...

01:30:05.893 --> 01:30:08.327
and you're not just anyone, Lyra.

01:30:08.363 --> 01:30:12.697
Your mother didn't die
in an airship accident as you were told.

01:30:12.734 --> 01:30:16.602
She wasn't married to your father,
and even though...

01:30:16.638 --> 01:30:20.233
even though she loved you
very much and...

01:30:20.274 --> 01:30:22.208
and she wanted to keep you...

01:30:24.078 --> 01:30:25.739
it wasn't allowed.

01:30:27.448 --> 01:30:30.576
And so you were taken from her.

01:30:30.618 --> 01:30:34.748
And it wasn't until things changed...

01:30:34.789 --> 01:30:37.519
and she was free to do
as she wanted, that...

01:30:40.328 --> 01:30:43.354
that she went to Jordan College
and she spoke to the Master.

01:30:43.398 --> 01:30:45.866
No! You can't be!

01:30:52.907 --> 01:30:56.536
Yes, Lyra, you're mine.

01:30:56.577 --> 01:30:59.478
And you're safe with me.

01:30:59.514 --> 01:31:02.483
You'll always be safe with me.

01:31:05.253 --> 01:31:07.346
Who's my father?

01:31:14.495 --> 01:31:17.987
Lord Asriel.
He's my father, isn't he?

01:31:20.535 --> 01:31:23.834
Yes. Yes.

01:31:33.715 --> 01:31:35.740
Now I almost forgot.

01:31:35.783 --> 01:31:40.083
The Master of Jordan
gave you something, didn't he?

01:31:40.121 --> 01:31:43.181
He gave you an alethiometer,
didn't he?

01:31:44.759 --> 01:31:46.590
But you see...

01:31:47.929 --> 01:31:50.625
it wasn't really his to give.

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:54.759
Ah, he did. Oh.

01:31:54.802 --> 01:31:58.898
Must've seemed such a puzzle, what
a silly old thing like that was any good for.

01:31:59.941 --> 01:32:02.000
All right.

01:32:04.779 --> 01:32:06.872
Here it is.

01:32:06.914 --> 01:32:08.575
Thank you.

01:32:10.985 --> 01:32:13.818
What a funny old tin. Did you...

01:32:13.855 --> 01:32:16.847
did you put it in here
to keep it safe?

01:32:40.214 --> 01:32:42.273
Run! Lyra, let's go! Go!

01:32:43.384 --> 01:32:45.944
We're just not used to that reaction.

01:32:45.987 --> 01:32:48.683
Understand this, Sister Clara,
they're not registered...

01:34:08.402 --> 01:34:10.836
Go on, then. Go on.

01:34:36.898 --> 01:34:39.594
Iorek! Iorek!

01:34:40.568 --> 01:34:41.967
Run, child!

01:34:45.139 --> 01:34:47.437
Let's go! Come on!

01:34:55.583 --> 01:34:57.346
- Quickly!
- Let's go!

01:35:15.303 --> 01:35:18.397
You'd better not touch me.
I'm warning you.

01:35:26.914 --> 01:35:29.041
Serafina Pekkala?

01:36:07.154 --> 01:36:10.021
- This way.
- Get out! Get out!

01:36:10.057 --> 01:36:11.922
- Mrs. Coulter!
- Get her up.

01:36:11.959 --> 01:36:14.120
Come!

01:36:16.630 --> 01:36:18.689
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

01:36:38.352 --> 01:36:40.445
Charge!

01:36:40.488 --> 01:36:42.217
Come on! Run!

01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:02.238
Come on! Get down, men!

01:37:02.276 --> 01:37:05.074
Mr. Scoresby, help lorek!

01:37:35.476 --> 01:37:37.137
Come on!

01:38:23.657 --> 01:38:26.820
Joe! Oh, my precious!

01:38:26.861 --> 01:38:29.659
- Dad!
- Oh, my goodness, boy!

01:38:31.365 --> 01:38:32.855
- Darling!
- Mum!

01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:34.629
Here's my daughter! Come here!

01:38:40.908 --> 01:38:44.002
Gyptians! To me!

01:38:44.044 --> 01:38:46.137
We're going home!

01:38:49.150 --> 01:38:52.085
Lyra, we've got to go.

01:38:52.119 --> 01:38:54.019
It's time to go home.

01:38:55.055 --> 01:38:56.750
I can't, Roger.

01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:59.657
I've got to go to my father
and bring him the alethiometer.

01:38:59.693 --> 01:39:02.389
- Your father?
- Lord Asriel...

01:39:02.429 --> 01:39:05.057
Mrs. Coulter and them...
they're gonna kill him.

01:39:05.099 --> 01:39:06.498
Then I'm going too.

01:39:06.534 --> 01:39:10.493
You said you was gonna
come and get me. You got me.

01:39:17.077 --> 01:39:20.843
Miss Lyra, are you ready to fly?

01:39:23.651 --> 01:39:25.642
I know where she's going.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.629
Well, they're all tucked in back there.

01:39:43.671 --> 01:39:46.196
That little girl's somethin', huh?

01:39:50.911 --> 01:39:53.812
There's a prophesy
about that child, Mr. Scoresby.

01:39:55.616 --> 01:39:58.380
She will decide the war
which is to come.

01:39:58.419 --> 01:39:59.784
War?

01:40:01.522 --> 01:40:04.047
I ain't heard rumor of any war.

01:40:04.091 --> 01:40:06.355
You will.

01:40:06.393 --> 01:40:10.056
It is your war too,
whether you know it or not.

01:40:10.097 --> 01:40:14.227
- What would the quarrel be about?
- Nothing less than free will.

01:40:15.369 --> 01:40:19.897
The Magisterium not only seeks to
control everyone in this world...

01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:22.408
but every world in every universe.

01:40:25.212 --> 01:40:28.204
They've been unable
to extend their power until now.

01:40:28.749 --> 01:40:32.446
But if Asriel finds
a way to travel between worlds...

01:40:32.486 --> 01:40:36.252
nothing will stop them
from trying to take over.

01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:38.258
Nothing but us...

01:40:38.292 --> 01:40:40.317
and that child.

01:40:50.337 --> 01:40:52.396
What's it telling you?

01:41:06.754 --> 01:41:08.654
It's telling me about my father.

01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:12.955
It says I'm bringing him
what he needs.

01:41:12.993 --> 01:41:15.188
We're going home, aren't we, Lyra?

01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:16.924
After we save your father.

01:41:18.899 --> 01:41:20.560
Course.

01:41:20.601 --> 01:41:23.934
'Cept, first we gotta sort out
some things that need sorting.

01:41:23.971 --> 01:41:28.101
Like Billy and them other kids that lost
their dæmons. We've got to help them.

01:41:28.976 --> 01:41:30.466
And it isn't like the Magisterium's...

01:41:30.511 --> 01:41:33.036
just gonna let us go home to Jordan
just like that...

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.275
or leave off ordering people about.

01:41:36.517 --> 01:41:38.644
And Dust...

01:41:38.686 --> 01:41:40.313
I want to know what Dust is.

01:41:41.588 --> 01:41:44.921
Maybe we're supposed to go to that other
world with my father and find out.

01:41:44.958 --> 01:41:47.256
That's an awful lot to sort out.

01:41:47.294 --> 01:41:48.989
Well, who else is gonna do it?

01:41:49.029 --> 01:41:51.623
'Sides, we're in this together now.

01:41:51.665 --> 01:41:53.860
Yeah, suppose we are.

01:41:55.636 --> 01:41:59.299
You reckon it would do any harm
to get some sleep now?

01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:00.432
Go on, then.

01:42:10.317 --> 01:42:12.547
We'll set things right.

01:42:12.586 --> 01:42:14.952
We will.

01:42:14.988 --> 01:42:17.388
You and me...

01:42:17.424 --> 01:42:19.255
and lorek.

01:42:19.293 --> 01:42:21.784
And Serafina Pekkala
and Mr. Scoresby.

01:42:24.031 --> 01:42:25.362
And my father.

01:42:26.133 --> 01:42:27.998
We'll set it right, Pan.

01:42:30.404 --> 01:42:32.395
Just let them try to stop us.

01:43:17.284 --> 01:43:20.651
# Where are our lives #

01:43:20.687 --> 01:43:23.918
# If there is no dream? #

01:43:23.957 --> 01:43:29.054
# Where is our home? #

01:43:29.096 --> 01:43:32.827
# We don't know how #

01:43:32.866 --> 01:43:36.324
# There will be a way #

01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:39.567
# Out of the storm #

01:43:39.606 --> 01:43:47.240
# We will find hope #

01:43:55.122 --> 01:44:02.290
# And her soul
walks beside her #

01:44:02.329 --> 01:44:08.757
# An army stands behind her #

01:44:08.802 --> 01:44:13.637
# Lyra #

01:44:13.674 --> 01:44:15.869
# Lyra #

01:44:15.909 --> 01:44:19.709
# And her face #

01:44:19.746 --> 01:44:22.681
# Full of grace #

01:44:22.716 --> 01:44:26.743
# Two worlds
collide around her #

01:44:26.787 --> 01:44:32.851
# The truth lies
deep inside her #

01:44:32.893 --> 01:44:37.956
# Lyra #

01:44:37.998 --> 01:44:40.489
# Lyra #

01:44:40.534 --> 01:44:47.030
# And the stars
look down upon her #

01:44:47.074 --> 01:44:53.343
# This darkness settles on her #

01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:58.317
# Lyra #

01:44:58.352 --> 01:45:00.547
# Lyra #

01:45:00.587 --> 01:45:07.220
# Who's to know
what's in the future? #

01:45:07.261 --> 01:45:11.163
# Every hope
we will be with her #

01:45:11.198 --> 01:45:17.159
# We have all our love
to give her #

01:45:17.204 --> 01:45:22.335
# Oh, Lyra #

01:45:22.376 --> 01:45:24.640
# Lyra #

01:45:24.678 --> 01:45:31.641
# And her soul
walks beside her #

01:45:31.685 --> 01:45:37.817
# An army stands behind her #
