00:34.826 --> 00:41.791
THE GREAT SEDUCTION

00:44.210 --> 00:48.339
I'll tell you the secret of living
in a paradise called Santa María.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.137
We are a small but mighty town
with a heart the size of a soccer stadium.

00:54.888 --> 00:59.601
120 lucky people
inhabit this oasis of rowdy pirates.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.728
Ever since I was a kid,

01:01.811 --> 01:04.064
I always wanted to go fishing
with my parents.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.537
They would spend countless hours
every day on their boats,

01:19.621 --> 01:23.083
casting their nets into the water
and returning with the day's catch.

01:28.296 --> 01:31.132
They worked from dusk till dawn.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.802
And while it was not a glamorous job,
they loved it.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.387
It's true.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.223
We weren't rich by any means,

01:38.306 --> 01:41.351
but we felt blessed
with the simple life we had.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.270
Let's eat!

01:45.230 --> 01:48.608
Our hearts were filled
with happiness and contentment.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.611
Well, at least
that's what my parents told me.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.703
At night, Santa María
shined brighter and more beautiful

02:00.787 --> 02:03.581
than all the stars in the sky.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.086
But one day,
everything suddenly changed.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.880
The neighboring town
opened up a modern fish-packing company.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.800
And shortly after,
we had nothing more to fish.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.009
It destroyed us.

02:16.886 --> 02:17.720
MEXICAN POST

02:17.804 --> 02:21.057
Our once prosperous town
now had to rely on the few bucks

02:21.141 --> 02:24.018
that the Unemployment Office
would hand out every month.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.400
Thank you, sir.

02:32.110 --> 02:35.029
In the following years,
with fishing no longer possible,

02:35.113 --> 02:38.658
many left in search of the American Dream,
or in some cases, nightmare.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.827
My brother Pablo being one of them.

02:42.745 --> 02:46.374
My name is Germán, and what runs
through my veins isn't blood.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.126
It's Santa María.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.712
I'm never leaving here.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.177
Germán, stop annoying the dog.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.262
He's the one annoying me.

03:02.932 --> 03:03.808
Hmm.

03:04.392 --> 03:08.438
At the time, I had no idea
our lives were about to change forever.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.441
Along with our little slice of heaven,
Santa María.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.241
Good morning!

03:20.325 --> 03:23.244
-How are you, Don Claudio?
-Germán. Good morning.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.295
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Anita.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.631
Good morning, Simón. How are you?

03:34.714 --> 03:35.798
I'm all right, Anita.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.300
Here you go.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.718
-Thank you.
-Of course.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.971
-Morning, Anita.
-Germán, good morning.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.683
I'm also gonna collect my mother's
if you don't mind.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.065
I don't think that's a good idea,
but it's on you.

03:52.148 --> 03:52.982
Yeah.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.401
Thank you. Have a good day.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.530
Mm-hmm.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.284
Afternoon. I've come to cash these checks.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.579
Here's mine, and here's my mother's.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.831
Germán, I've already told you I can't.

04:08.915 --> 04:09.874
Okay.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.086
You've seen this letter
a thousand times, right? Cash it.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.712
-It's illegal.
-It's not illegal.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.006
-It's illegal.
-No, it isn't. The letter says so.

04:17.715 --> 04:18.967
I'll lose my job, Germán.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.970
Of course you won't. Relax.
If you do, I'll shave my head.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.604
Have a good day.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.945
I got the money.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.489
This will cover food for another month.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.534
What is it?

04:45.201 --> 04:47.870
My brother called.
There's an opportunity in the city.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.208
Again with that, María?

04:54.043 --> 04:55.211
You really want to leave?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.505
If that will give us work, then yes.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.299
But we can't leave just like that.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.717
Why not?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.677
Because this is our home.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.805
Yes, yes, Germán.
But we don't have a job in this town.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.390
We've got the unemployment checks.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.393
Do you really want us
to keep living like thieves?

05:10.476 --> 05:14.188
To keep collecting a government check
that's not even under your name?

05:14.272 --> 05:15.982
It is under my name.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.568
It is, and I have this power of attorney
for the other one.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.446
-Of someone who's already dead.
-Not according to the government.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.281
Her grave says otherwise.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.913
I'm not going to work
in the city, María. Enough.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.874
The job is for me, Germán.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.543
I can no longer play along
with your fantasy.

05:35.626 --> 05:36.544
I'm sorry.

05:37.128 --> 05:41.215
Announcing a mandatory town meeting!

05:42.800 --> 05:46.721
Announcing a mandatory town meeting!

05:46.804 --> 05:47.680
Simón!

05:49.891 --> 05:53.811
Announcing a mandatory town meeting!

05:54.645 --> 05:56.230
Morning. Good morning.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.820
What? Wasn't there a meeting?
Where's everybody?

06:03.446 --> 06:05.323
Held up by traffic.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.992
For a couple years now, actually.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.079
Well then, shall we start or what?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.540
I spoke to the packing company.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.377
Wha-- Which… which packing company?

06:17.919 --> 06:19.295
The fish-packing company.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.091
The company is considering
opening a plant here

06:23.174 --> 06:24.592
and wants to give all of us jobs.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.260
And why don't you look happy?

06:26.344 --> 06:27.887
Because we will never make it.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.808
But you're the mayor.
You have to do something.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.768
We need that packing company.

06:33.851 --> 06:36.604
We need to start selling our fish
to the other towns.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.274
I've tried everything I can think of

06:40.358 --> 06:42.568
to convince them
to open here in Santa María.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.031
Well, it seems it's not enough.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.201
Listen, Benjamín. I begged them.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.287
But they're asking for a doctor. A doctor!

06:54.872 --> 06:59.043
They're claiming their insurance company
won't authorize the new packing facility

06:59.127 --> 07:01.796
unless we have a doctor permanently.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.256
Well then, let's hire one!

07:03.339 --> 07:05.383
Oh, Germán!

07:05.466 --> 07:07.885
-We live in Santa María, you fool!
-So what?

07:07.969 --> 07:09.429
We've been trying for 15 years,

07:09.512 --> 07:11.931
searching for a doctor
willing to settle here.

07:12.014 --> 07:12.890
That's the issue.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.268
We need to stop searching
and start finding.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.478
Screw this. I'm out.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.897
-Ramón!
-Brilliant idea.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.566
No one ever thought of that.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.863
There has to be a doctor
who wants to live here.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.824
And we'll find him.

07:30.908 --> 07:31.784
You'll see.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.873
SANTA MARÍA RESTAURANT

07:36.956 --> 07:39.709
First my brother and now María?

07:42.086 --> 07:44.213
I think it's time for you
to leave this town.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.423
No, no, no, no.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.134
My home is in this town.

07:48.718 --> 07:52.805
My roots are here.
The only way I'm leaving is in a casket.

07:52.889 --> 07:53.764
Really?

07:55.016 --> 07:56.476
You're just gonna let her go?

08:03.441 --> 08:05.026
Pass me that one first.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.320
That one. Careful, care--

08:07.403 --> 08:08.321
There you go.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.449
This one goes there.

08:12.033 --> 08:12.867
Ramón.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.371
What… what are you doing?

08:20.082 --> 08:21.834
We're going on vacation.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.630
With all your things
and your furniture?

08:26.631 --> 08:27.507
At this time?

08:28.090 --> 08:31.886
The truth is
I got a good job in the city.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.597
Besides…

08:34.680 --> 08:36.307
Sweetie, come here, please.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.685
My daughter needs glasses.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.064
She's as blind as her mom.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.273
My sight's terrible.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.067
I mean, I married this man.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.694
What about the packing company?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.156
Good luck, Germán.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.620
But what will we do
if we manage to get a doctor here?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.456
How are we going to make him stay?

09:43.332 --> 09:46.460
Well, uh, we're going to convince…

09:47.003 --> 09:49.547
No, we will seduce him.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.592
-Seduce him.
-How exactly?

09:54.552 --> 09:57.263
Well, we… we'll think of something, right?

09:57.847 --> 09:59.223
-Yes, yes.
-Ah.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.559
With your usual lies, then?

10:01.642 --> 10:05.104
Anita, don't you want the town
to be the way it used to be?

10:05.771 --> 10:10.151
With a company that could potentially lie
about everything it promised you?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.111
Everything it promised us, Anita.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.655
Remember, this benefits everybody.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.450
It's for you, for me, for Simón,

10:17.533 --> 10:19.744
for our town, and for the school.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.496
For the school, Anita.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.167
Hmm.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.419
No, no, no, no, no.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.379
Scratch off "seven hours" from the city

10:30.463 --> 10:33.382
and say that we're only three hours away!

10:34.759 --> 10:37.553
What? Three, six, seven hours.
Time is a relative thing.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.849
Anything else?

10:41.932 --> 10:43.309
-Anything else?
-Huh? No.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.435
I'm going to print it.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.521
Aw!

10:49.106 --> 10:52.276
Letters, letters,
and more letters.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.112
We sent out letters to every doctor
living in the nearest city

10:55.196 --> 10:59.200
who would be willing to leave their job
and come live in our little fishing town.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.410
We had our local post office
working overtime

11:01.494 --> 11:03.204
to make sure all the letters went out.

11:03.287 --> 11:06.457
Long, painstaking hours were spent
licking stamps and envelopes.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.046
And we sent them out with the same energy
and innocence as a child writing to Santa,

11:12.797 --> 11:15.675
hoping we, too,
would get what we had asked for.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.054
The whole town asked for the same thing.

11:20.137 --> 11:23.432
A town doctor that would allow us
to have our own fish-packing company.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.311
Letters after letters
and even some more letters.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.814
We won't give up.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.943
We'll change one of their lives,
and they don't know it yet.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.363
Doctor, they're waiting for you
in Room 12.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.864
Coming.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.366
DEAR DR. LOPÉZ,

11:54.964 --> 11:55.965
Any responses?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.596
Thanks, Anita.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.408
I swear, baby. Today's the day.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.704
I'm sure they'll give me
the position at the hospital.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.373
Of course you'll get it.
You're the hardest worker I know.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.835
You deserve it.
I'm so excited. I love you.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.214
-After you.
-Thank you.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.053
Bro, tomorrow we're watching the game
at my place.

12:43.137 --> 12:46.015
Yo, if your Cowboys lose,
you're treating us to dinner, champ.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.475
That won't happen.

12:54.899 --> 12:55.733
Suárez.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.194
Dr. Suárez.

12:59.028 --> 13:03.199
You've always been a very capable doctor,
always there for your patients.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.826
Your track record is flawless.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.288
However, given the circumstances,

13:09.371 --> 13:12.249
I've been forced
to give the position to another doctor.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.462
Who will you give it to?

13:19.590 --> 13:20.883
It's Mau!

13:20.966 --> 13:22.134
They gave it to him.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.222
I'm so sorry, baby!
I can't believe it.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.309
Well, I'll see you later for dinner.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.188
Actually, Val is coming to town,
and I promised her we'd meet up.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.026
Lucía, I booked it months ago.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.205
Ah!

13:52.706 --> 13:55.543
Oh!

13:56.210 --> 13:58.629
How could you? It's unacceptable!

14:00.047 --> 14:01.924
I swear that isn't me.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.009
I have no idea what got over me.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.304
Now I'm certain
I was right not giving you the position.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.182
Getting wasted and pissing on my car?

14:10.266 --> 14:13.269
Only because you're a great doctor
and a good person

14:13.352 --> 14:15.479
am I not taking your medical license away.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.022
However,

14:17.648 --> 14:19.483
if you want to keep working
at this hospital,

14:19.567 --> 14:20.818
you must go to this town.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.405
Santa María. 120 inhabitants.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.700
You'll be their doctor for one month.

14:29.785 --> 14:30.619
No.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.414
Look, chief, you can't do this to me.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.082
Would you rather lose your license?

14:35.165 --> 14:38.377
But you can't send me
to a town like that.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.545
You leave on Monday.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.760
Attention! We've found a doctor!

14:46.844 --> 14:50.389
Announcing a mandatory town meeting!

14:50.472 --> 14:54.143
We have to fix the bell.
That speaker is just garbage.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.604
Well, no one
came to the meeting to fix it.

14:59.773 --> 15:00.649
Damn it!

15:13.370 --> 15:14.955
Listen! Santa María!

15:16.248 --> 15:18.000
There's a town meeting!

15:18.959 --> 15:20.336
There's a meeting, damn it!

15:20.419 --> 15:21.462
There's a meeting!

15:23.339 --> 15:26.091
Come on, Felipe. It's meeting time!
Meeting time, everybody!

15:27.760 --> 15:29.219
Come on! Let's go!

15:32.848 --> 15:35.434
Hustle.
Let's get one thing clear.

15:35.517 --> 15:39.313
If you hear the church speaker,
it means there's a town meeting!

15:39.396 --> 15:40.439
Listen up.

15:40.522 --> 15:44.109
A doctor is coming to Santa María
for one month.

15:45.027 --> 15:48.989
We have exactly one month
to convince this doctor

15:49.073 --> 15:51.492
to move here
and sign a long-term contract.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.785
If the doctor signs,

15:53.661 --> 15:55.829
we will get the packing company for sure!

15:56.664 --> 15:58.332
-It ain't for sure.
-Yes, it is.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.294
Of course it is.
Why wouldn't it be? Anyway!

16:02.378 --> 16:04.672
We'll finally be able to have jobs again.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.549
And we'll establish a joint venture
so that, in time,

16:07.633 --> 16:09.301
we all own the packing company.

16:09.385 --> 16:13.055
Who doesn't want to throw away
those checks we receive each month?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.474
To sell our own fish.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.935
Don't you want your husbands
to come back from the US?

16:18.018 --> 16:21.397
-Yes!
-We have to put our town back on the map.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.734
Instead of going to beg gringos
for a couple of bucks,

16:25.818 --> 16:28.821
alone, without families,
barely speaking another language!

16:29.405 --> 16:32.700
We have exactly one month
to convince this doctor

16:33.242 --> 16:36.662
that Santa María
is the most beautiful place to live!

16:36.745 --> 16:38.122
-Because it is!
-Yes!

16:41.959 --> 16:45.421
We have one month
to convince this doctor, Mateo Suárez,

16:46.046 --> 16:48.465
that Santa María
is the town he was waiting for.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.677
To have him fall in love with Santa María!

16:54.513 --> 16:55.431
Come on!

16:57.433 --> 16:58.767
Tamales!

16:59.393 --> 17:01.645
I've got mole! Sweet and hot tamales!

17:01.729 --> 17:03.939
Come get your tamales!

17:06.316 --> 17:08.902
It has to be love at first sight.

17:09.903 --> 17:10.863
You are right.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.532
We need to leave the town spotless!

17:13.615 --> 17:15.451
CLEAN THE TOWN
REPAIR THE CHURCH

17:15.534 --> 17:17.494
Do you know what would be a great idea?

17:18.287 --> 17:21.915
For him to find money.
There's nothing better than to find money.

17:21.999 --> 17:25.210
It doesn't matter if it's a quarter.
You're happy for a few days.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.754
You feel lucky.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.964
We can seduce him like that.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.799
Yeah, yeah. Good idea!

17:32.217 --> 17:33.052
Really, Germán?

17:33.802 --> 17:34.970
Go ahead, do it. Do it.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.805
And what's our budget look like?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.807
What do you mean "what's our budget"?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.976
You're the one
in charge of the budget, damn it!

17:41.643 --> 17:44.563
Okay, first things first.
How will we bring him?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.024
Huh? We'll scare him off with our rafts.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.150
I know.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.028
Let's get an amazing catamaran.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.198
No, a yacht would be better.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.951
Now we need the most modern house
to accommodate him there.

17:58.035 --> 17:58.952
Use mine.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.621
What? Yours?

18:00.704 --> 18:02.623
-I mean, it's modern, but--
-But what?

18:02.706 --> 18:03.624
But it's horrible.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.292
It's the most modern in town.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.420
That's the way
houses in the city are made like this.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.630
What? Horrible?

18:09.713 --> 18:11.465
It's the only one with a landline.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.133
American Football League.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.259
-Modern.
-Horrible.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.969
-Modern!
-Horrible!

18:16.053 --> 18:17.429
American Football League!

18:17.513 --> 18:19.681
I was… I was
researching the doctor online.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.643
He's a fan of American football.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.401
These are basically the rules,
the field, and the uniforms.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.697
Yeah, it's almost
the same thing as soccer, no?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.199
-Yeah.
-Yes.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.245
Oh!

18:44.832 --> 18:46.583
Shouldn't we remove the goals?

18:48.168 --> 18:52.965
The art of seduction
requires one to look good and smell good.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.049
A conqueror.

18:54.758 --> 18:57.177
One must understand
what they want to seduce.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.599
One must be able
to speak their native language.

19:03.892 --> 19:07.396
Tell them exactly what they want to hear
when they want to hear it.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.524
The art of seduction seems easy,
but it's quite a complicated endeavor.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.234
In our case,

19:12.317 --> 19:15.571
successfully seducing the doctor
will take the entire town.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.530
High five.

19:16.613 --> 19:20.033
They thought we were lazy bums,
only good at collecting unemployment.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.872
No one will ever need to stand in line
to collect those checks.

19:26.123 --> 19:30.502
Through our cooperation and diligent work
from sunrise to sundown,

19:30.586 --> 19:32.880
we will show them
what Santa María is really capable of.

19:48.812 --> 19:49.938
You are beautiful.

19:57.487 --> 19:58.447
Good as new.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.543
It's pink, Consuelo.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.545
Oh, come on. It's basically white!

20:13.629 --> 20:15.964
-It's pink!
-Ugh!

20:18.759 --> 20:20.093
It's perfect!

20:34.775 --> 20:36.235
What are we doing this for?

20:36.318 --> 20:38.070
We're gonna monitor his landline.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.364
-What for?
-To get to know him better.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.949
-Ah.
-Oh shoot!

20:53.418 --> 20:56.046
It's fixed!

20:56.546 --> 21:00.050
Long live Santa María!

21:02.386 --> 21:03.512
Son of a bitch.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.306
There are the positions.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.349
-Whose?
-When?

21:07.432 --> 21:11.228
No, hold on. We need to see
the yard indicators to the goal line here.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.690
Yard by yard.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.032
Enough, calm down!

21:26.159 --> 21:28.203
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

21:31.039 --> 21:32.916
We only need two teams.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.586
It's obvious nobody read the manual.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.339
Who wants to kick off the ball first?

21:39.423 --> 21:41.174
To the middle. And on this side?

21:44.177 --> 21:45.554
Make a bit more room, guys.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.516
The two of you will be the team captains.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.019
It's really that simple.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.105
Can we all get started right now?

21:56.148 --> 21:57.232
Thirty-six!

21:58.775 --> 22:00.402
-Thirty-six!
-Set, hut!

22:01.987 --> 22:03.739
-Run, run, run!
-Run, run!

22:03.822 --> 22:05.657
-Thirty-six!
-Set, hut!

22:05.741 --> 22:07.993
I'm open! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge!

22:10.787 --> 22:13.415
Jorge! Jorge!

22:13.498 --> 22:14.875
Pass the ball!

22:16.418 --> 22:17.586
Hustle!

22:17.669 --> 22:19.046
Thirty-six!

22:19.880 --> 22:20.714
I'm open!

22:21.340 --> 22:23.842
You caught it, Benjamín! Run! Run!

22:27.220 --> 22:28.347
Take him down!

22:43.320 --> 22:44.363
Can you hear me?

22:44.446 --> 22:45.530
Can you hear me?

22:45.614 --> 22:46.990
-Yes, yes, Pepe.
-Yes, yes.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.658
-I hear you, Pepe. Yes.
-What'd he say?

22:48.742 --> 22:50.202
We can hear. Yes, we can.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.661
Can you hear me?

22:51.745 --> 22:52.954
-Yes, we can!
-I'll be back.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.122
Quickly!

22:54.206 --> 22:55.791
Oh, we did it!

23:05.634 --> 23:10.138
SEA STAR

23:15.394 --> 23:16.770
Don Claudio!

23:17.396 --> 23:18.230
Claudio!

23:18.313 --> 23:20.565
Good morning! Have a good one!

23:36.289 --> 23:37.332
No signal, Doc.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.710
All we have is landlines.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.380
Internet?

23:44.214 --> 23:46.174
-Wi-Fi?
-We've got an Internet café!

23:46.758 --> 23:50.637
But it only works sometimes.
The connection is pretty terrible.

23:51.346 --> 23:53.390
-Quiet!
-What?

23:54.433 --> 23:55.725
It's true though.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.645
That way,
you can fully connect with nature, Doc.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.949
They're coming! They're coming!

24:11.032 --> 24:12.033
They're coming!

24:12.117 --> 24:13.410
Places everyone. Hurry!

24:13.493 --> 24:16.746
Quickly! Now.
All the ones in blue to that side!

24:24.504 --> 24:25.547
Oh!

24:29.092 --> 24:30.719
Uy!

24:30.802 --> 24:33.346
Oh man! Damn, what a hit!

24:38.226 --> 24:39.060
No!

24:39.936 --> 24:42.314
I can't believe it!
You play football here?

24:42.397 --> 24:45.650
Yes! Yes, it's the official sport
of Santa María.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.361
-You really play football here?
-Of course!

24:48.445 --> 24:50.405
It's a tradition.
We even have a league, right?

24:50.489 --> 24:51.323
Yes.

24:51.823 --> 24:52.824
That's weird.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.660
I've never seen
a quarterback stand like that.

24:56.786 --> 24:57.621
A quarterback…

24:58.288 --> 25:00.624
He's the star of the team, you know.

25:00.707 --> 25:04.085
As you can see,
his technique is quite unique, huh?

25:04.169 --> 25:06.004
Man, he's a hell of a player.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.882
Well, it might work
to his advantage.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.258
Can we go there?

25:11.468 --> 25:12.511
-No.
-Sure!

25:12.594 --> 25:14.930
-Yeah? Come on. Yes, let's go!
-No.

25:15.013 --> 25:15.972
-But--
-Okay, let's go!

25:16.056 --> 25:17.474
-But--
-Let's just go!

25:17.557 --> 25:19.309
Are you dumb?
What the hell, Baches!

25:19.392 --> 25:20.602
-No, I--
-Damn it!

25:20.685 --> 25:22.103
They're coming this way!

25:22.187 --> 25:24.731
-Darn.
-They're coming this way.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.650
-They're coming!
-Go to your places!

25:26.733 --> 25:28.401
-Okay!
-Everybody, to your positions!

25:28.485 --> 25:30.111
-Thirty-six!
-Set, hut!

25:30.195 --> 25:31.988
Jorge, Jorge!

25:32.072 --> 25:33.240
Pass the ball!

25:34.115 --> 25:35.867
Now run, Benjamín. Run!

25:35.951 --> 25:38.954
-Run, run!
-Run! Run!

25:39.037 --> 25:40.121
Run!

25:49.923 --> 25:50.924
What is he doing?

25:51.007 --> 25:53.093
Whoo! We won! Yeah!

25:53.176 --> 25:54.844
Whoo! We won!

25:58.390 --> 26:01.476
Oh, I think he got excited
because the match ended.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.686
We missed it, sorry.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.605
Yay! Well done, team. Yes, yes. Celebrate.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.025
Hold on. Did both teams win?

26:10.819 --> 26:11.861
The sport won.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.823
End of the season.
Imagine that. Everybody wins.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.408
Really.

26:33.174 --> 26:34.884
-Careful, Doc.
-Thank you.

26:34.968 --> 26:35.969
Let me help you.

26:36.636 --> 26:37.554
There you go.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.307
Boys.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.643
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.947
Well, welcome to Santa María,

26:56.031 --> 26:58.992
a town of kindness
where you can breathe without fear.

26:59.075 --> 27:02.370
As you can see, it's a piece of heaven.

27:02.454 --> 27:06.499
SANTA MARÍA
WORLD HERITAGE SITE

27:09.586 --> 27:10.754
Careful there.

27:16.676 --> 27:19.179
-Thank you.
-Right here, let me introduce to--

27:19.971 --> 27:21.306
Stop!

27:22.974 --> 27:26.186
Santa María,
our town's dear and holy patroness.

27:29.898 --> 27:30.815
What do you think?

27:31.358 --> 27:33.193
-Very pretty.
-This way.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.487
Thank you.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.873
Okay, well, you can get settled in,

27:47.957 --> 27:50.168
and we'll bring you your bags later.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.965
-I appreciate it, Germán.
-Man, no problem.

27:57.425 --> 28:00.470
And if you need anything,
I live right around the corner.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.768
Please make yourself at home. All right.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.897
WELCOME DR. MATEO

29:01.322 --> 29:04.159
-Hello?
-Hi, how was your arrival?

29:04.242 --> 29:07.370
I'm beat.
You can't imagine the journey to get here.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.873
And how's the town?

29:10.749 --> 29:11.708
The island?

29:12.625 --> 29:14.544
It's tiny.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.963
I see. And Hernán?

29:18.047 --> 29:18.882
Germán.

29:19.632 --> 29:20.467
Chill.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.429
Very kind but a bit weird.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.223
And how's the house?

29:28.308 --> 29:29.142
The house?

29:32.145 --> 29:33.396
The house is horrible.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.942
It has the most hideous decorations
I've ever seen in my life.

29:40.695 --> 29:44.574
You have no idea
the picture I'm looking at right now.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.205
Which picture? What-- It's still up?

29:50.830 --> 29:51.748
You degenerate.

29:52.874 --> 29:53.958
What are you doing?

29:54.584 --> 29:58.171
I'm getting ready to go out.
I'm going to eat at your favorite place.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.217
Baby, I would kill
for a chicken tikka masala.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.010
What did he say?

30:04.093 --> 30:05.345
Chicken tikka masala.

30:06.262 --> 30:09.182
Chicken "ticket" masala.
Hurry, to the kitchen!

30:10.809 --> 30:11.643
But which one?

30:11.726 --> 30:13.144
Which one? The restaurant!

30:13.978 --> 30:14.813
Okay.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.733
Chicken tikka masala!
Chicken tikka masala!

30:18.817 --> 30:21.611
Chicken tikka masala!
Chicken tikka masala!

30:21.694 --> 30:23.696
Chicken tikka masala! Oh.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.783
Chicken tikka masala!
Chicken tikka masala!

30:26.866 --> 30:28.743
What's up with this kid?

30:28.827 --> 30:31.204
-This kid is crazy!
-Chicken tikka masala!

30:31.287 --> 30:33.581
-Chick a-tic-a what?
-Chicken tikka masala!

30:33.665 --> 30:35.583
It's the doctor's favorite meal!

30:37.460 --> 30:40.213
Chicken tikka masala.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.676
Indian-style chicken.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.354
Hi there.

30:57.146 --> 30:57.981
Hello.

30:58.481 --> 31:03.027
Uh, do you know where
I can find a restaurant?

31:03.111 --> 31:06.155
The restaurant, you mean.

31:06.239 --> 31:09.492
You passed it.
It's all the way back on this street.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.245
-Oh. Okay, thank you.
-Mmm.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.872
My name's Mateo.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.039
I'm Ana.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.291
Nice to meet you, Ana.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.293
-See you around, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.550
Any chance
you have something with chicken?

31:27.427 --> 31:29.929
TODAY'S SPECIAL:
CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA

31:31.556 --> 31:33.057
Chicken tikka masala?

31:34.726 --> 31:36.686
In that case,
I'll have one of those, please.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.695
Nice to have you, Doctor.

31:45.778 --> 31:46.863
Welcome.

32:04.130 --> 32:07.175
Not too bad for the first day.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.718
Benjamín was right.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.553
There's no better way
for a town to seduce you

32:10.637 --> 32:14.015
than by finding money on the floor
and feeling extremely lucky.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.153
Good morning, Mr. Doc.

32:28.029 --> 32:31.240
I shouldn't be here, but I wanted
to welcome you and introduce myself.

32:31.741 --> 32:32.700
I'm Benjamín.

32:33.534 --> 32:34.911
The owner of this house.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.788
Oh! How are you?

32:36.871 --> 32:38.373
-Yes. Yes.
-Pleasure, Benjamín.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.291
Thanks a lot for… for having me.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.962
-Ah.
-You have a very… special house.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.507
Why's everyone here?

32:49.509 --> 32:51.469
They came for an appointment, Mr. Doc.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.890
Okay. Um, I'll need coffee.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.809
You don't have a coffee machine?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.733
No. I meant the one for making espressos.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.901
Yep, this is it.

33:13.116 --> 33:17.078
Okay, Mr. Delfino.
Let's take a big breath.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.248
Now exhale.

33:21.499 --> 33:24.043
Very well. Open your mouth, please.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.129
Wider.

33:27.213 --> 33:28.297
A bit more.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.341
That's it.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.054
-Does it hurt here?
-No, Doctor.

33:40.309 --> 33:42.020
I have athlete's foot, Doc.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.731
It's always itching and irritating me.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.108
And, well, it's kind of spreading up.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.653
And now,
it doesn't look like athlete's foot.

33:50.737 --> 33:53.489
I think it's more like
athlete's leg, Doctor.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.826
I'm afraid it's going
to keep on spreading up north.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.787
Know what I mean?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.039
You wanna see?

34:11.132 --> 34:12.341
Hey, the syringe!

34:16.929 --> 34:18.681
How can I help you?

34:18.765 --> 34:22.143
Give me birth control pills.
That's all I need. Please, Doctor.

34:22.685 --> 34:23.519
I beg you.

34:31.986 --> 34:32.862
Anita.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.074
-Good afternoon, Anita.
-Hi, Germán.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.201
Listen, I was thinking

34:39.410 --> 34:41.871
the other day I saw
the doctor leaving your house.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.248
Mm-hmm. Your point?

34:44.332 --> 34:45.917
Nothing, nothing.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.212
He ain't half bad.

34:50.129 --> 34:53.716
Honestly, the doctor is
quite a handsome man.

34:54.842 --> 34:55.676
And…

34:57.345 --> 34:58.554
Any chance you like him?

35:00.848 --> 35:03.226
Germán, you know he's engaged.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.061
True, but not even a little bit?

35:05.937 --> 35:07.271
I like being by myself.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.780
Hon, I'm swamped with work.
I don't think I'll make it.

35:15.863 --> 35:18.908
What about the weekend?
I can't take one month without seeing you.

35:18.991 --> 35:21.661
I'm sorry, baby.
But it's not my fault you're stuck there.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.123
I'll call tomorrow, okay?

35:28.626 --> 35:29.752
Good morning.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.547
Ah! Look at that!

35:33.172 --> 35:34.841
You're all settled in, Doc.

35:36.175 --> 35:37.718
Very good. Very good.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.054
So, the appointments went well?

35:41.931 --> 35:44.600
At this rate, I won't last a week.

35:49.689 --> 35:54.527
The doctor said he saw
40 patients in a single day.

35:55.903 --> 35:57.780
He doesn't think he'll last a week.

35:58.531 --> 36:02.326
He said he saw things
he had never seen before.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.328
He said, and I quote…

36:07.290 --> 36:11.085
"I had the feeling
of having traveled to the Middle Ages."

36:11.627 --> 36:15.506
The Middle Ages.
That's like, what, 500 years ago, right?

36:15.590 --> 36:17.466
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.010
Is this your way of charming someone?

36:19.093 --> 36:21.179
Man, I don't know how to do that…

36:21.721 --> 36:23.723
Who has the athlete's foot?

36:29.103 --> 36:29.937
Jorge!

36:33.733 --> 36:35.484
What? You thought it was a good idea

36:35.568 --> 36:38.279
to convince him to stay
by showing him your disgusting fungus?

36:38.362 --> 36:40.865
I just can't take the itchiness.
And the smell.

36:40.948 --> 36:42.116
Enough, damn it!

36:44.160 --> 36:48.748
From now on, I'll be the one deciding
which appointments he'll take.

36:48.831 --> 36:50.249
Are we clear?

36:50.333 --> 36:51.375
-Yes.
-Yes.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.879
Well, then, who needs one?

36:54.962 --> 36:56.631
Me.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.341
I need one too.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.184
Jorge.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.729
Listen, do you have a minute.
I've been thinking.

37:11.812 --> 37:15.274
Yes, I know. I know.
I won't show my feet to the doctor.

37:15.358 --> 37:18.069
No, it's not that.
You like music, don't you?

37:19.111 --> 37:20.446
-Yes.
-Perfect.

37:20.529 --> 37:23.908
Why don't you put on some rock songs
for the doctor? He'll love that.

37:23.991 --> 37:25.952
Ah. No, man. I hate rock.

37:26.452 --> 37:27.870
My thing is cumbia.

37:27.954 --> 37:32.917
Well, but cumbia, rock, rock, cumbia.
At the end of the day, it's music. Okay.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.502
I'm counting on you.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.672
No. No, no, no! I hate rock, eh!

37:37.755 --> 37:39.799
Don't worry.
Don't worry. You'll like it.

37:39.882 --> 37:42.134
It will surprise you. You'll see. Thanks.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.046
I've been here three days.
I can't take it anymore.

38:19.630 --> 38:22.091
I'm going to call my boss
and ask him if I can come back.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.011
I'll call you later, baby.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.396
-Good morning.
-Yes, good morning.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.856
Where am I calling?

38:36.939 --> 38:38.858
Uh, uh, the hospital.

38:38.941 --> 38:40.151
Oh, good morning.

38:40.234 --> 38:43.654
Can I speak with Dr. Peña, please?
Tell him it's Dr. Mateo Suárez.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.156
Of course, Doctor. Hold, please.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.868
-What do we do? What do we do?
-"What do we do?" Shush!

38:50.786 --> 38:53.372
-Dr. Suárez?
-Yes?

38:53.456 --> 38:55.374
Dr. Peña is very mad at you.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.752
He says you should stop calling him.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.463
Because if you call again,
you'll never be able to return.

39:01.213 --> 39:02.423
Have a nice day, Doctor.

39:27.615 --> 39:28.949
Good morning, Doctor.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.243
-Good morning, ma'am.
-I've come for a checkup.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.661
Of course. Come on in.

39:34.246 --> 39:37.249
Doctor, you've been bitten by mosquitos.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.919
Yeah. It's bad. Please come in.

39:47.093 --> 39:48.803
Hello? Mr. Hernández?

39:49.303 --> 39:50.179
Yes?

39:51.305 --> 39:54.934
Uh, how are you?
This is… this is Germán. Germán Herrera.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.937
-Wait, who?
-Germán, from Santa María.

39:58.437 --> 40:00.648
The town pitching for the packing company.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.525
Ah, yes. Yes. Yes.

40:02.608 --> 40:05.861
I remember your town's proposal now.
How can I help you, Germán?

40:05.945 --> 40:10.199
Well, I was just calling to tell you
we've managed to hire a doctor

40:10.741 --> 40:12.868
to permanently relocate here.

40:13.869 --> 40:16.080
Um, that's great to hear that, Germán,

40:16.163 --> 40:21.210
but we're gonna build the facility
in Catalina de los Ríos.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.087
They made us a great offer…

40:23.170 --> 40:26.674
We… we can also make you
a great offer, boss.

40:27.174 --> 40:28.592
Uh, look, Germán,

40:29.176 --> 40:32.721
they paid a generous personal guarantee.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.474
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

40:36.517 --> 40:40.104
And exactly how much
was that generous personal guarantee?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.483
Thirty thousand dollars?

40:46.318 --> 40:48.195
They're asking for a bribe!

40:48.279 --> 40:50.489
That's just the way
business works, Benjamín.

40:50.573 --> 40:51.907
It's capitalism.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.451
But that's a lot of money.

40:53.534 --> 40:57.246
But we're gonna get it back.
When we finally sell our fish, right?

40:57.746 --> 40:59.874
I won't be able
to get that amount of money.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.168
It's called a loan, Benjamín.
A business loan.

41:02.251 --> 41:05.421
Germán, my boss won't accept this.

41:05.921 --> 41:09.592
Your boss? Aren't you old enough
to make a decision?

41:09.675 --> 41:13.721
I'm this close to being replaced
by an ATM, okay?

41:13.804 --> 41:15.806
You're already an ATM.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.016
It's obvious!

41:17.099 --> 41:18.267
What are you implying?

41:18.934 --> 41:21.103
I've been managing this bank for 12 years!

41:21.187 --> 41:27.151
And if you could,
please remember that there are cameras.

41:30.196 --> 41:33.199
Do you really think
someone ever checks that camera, Benjamín?

41:33.282 --> 41:35.743
Gentlemen, good evening.
What can I do for you?

41:35.826 --> 41:37.703
Benjamín, I'm begging you.

41:37.786 --> 41:39.038
Oh, a business loan!

41:39.121 --> 41:41.957
So, tell me,
what's the amount you'd like to borrow?

41:42.041 --> 41:45.127
-I'm going to kick your ass!
-Simón, calm down. Simón.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.212
Damn it!

41:48.047 --> 41:48.881
Your name?

41:49.715 --> 41:54.553
So we found a way
to listen to all of his calls…

41:54.637 --> 41:56.305
-He has no ide--
-Evening, ladies.

41:57.681 --> 42:00.100
-Germán, what are you doing here?
-Me?

42:00.601 --> 42:02.436
Wait. What are you
hiding back there, Anita?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.395
Nothing.

42:05.397 --> 42:06.357
Nothing?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.526
You sure? Let me see.

42:08.609 --> 42:12.279
No, it's just what's written there
could hurt your feelings.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.197
Mm-hmm.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.032
I really can't show you.

42:15.115 --> 42:18.702
It's very personal information
that we shouldn't use.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.663
Anita, come on.

42:20.746 --> 42:21.705
Hmm.

42:24.124 --> 42:27.836
When he was a kid,
he lost his brother, and that scarred him.

42:31.173 --> 42:32.675
Oh, well, just like me.

42:32.758 --> 42:33.676
What?

42:34.552 --> 42:36.554
Germán, you still have a brother.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.223
He just moved away to the US.

42:39.306 --> 42:41.517
Well, yeah, but the same thing, no?

42:42.101 --> 42:44.436
Promise us you won't use that information.

42:44.937 --> 42:47.690
-Deal?
-You actually believe him?

42:47.773 --> 42:50.776
Anita, make him give you a guarantee.
If he uses it, he has to shave his head.

42:51.569 --> 42:52.444
All right, then.

42:57.199 --> 42:59.243
Have you ever considered
leaving this place?

43:00.619 --> 43:02.538
No, I wouldn't leave Santa María.

43:06.834 --> 43:09.670
If I could just sit here
and fish every single day,

43:10.879 --> 43:12.131
I wouldn't leave either.

43:22.308 --> 43:23.392
How old are you?

43:25.019 --> 43:25.978
Thirty-three.

43:26.854 --> 43:27.688
Why?

43:30.190 --> 43:31.734
No, it's just…

43:33.360 --> 43:36.155
Well, my brother would be the same age,

43:37.698 --> 43:38.782
but he died.

43:42.369 --> 43:43.412
I'm very sorry.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.089
I also lost my brother.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.302
He was four years old.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.221
We had an accident, and…

44:04.433 --> 44:06.185
the ambulance took too long.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.190
That's why I'm a doctor.

44:14.526 --> 44:15.903
To be able to save lives.

44:22.451 --> 44:24.286
I don't really talk about this…

44:24.370 --> 44:25.204
Hmm.

44:27.247 --> 44:28.248
Me neither.

44:40.844 --> 44:43.430
Is it always this hard to catch something,
or do I just suck?

44:43.514 --> 44:45.683
No, you just need
to practice a little more.

44:46.433 --> 44:47.267
You'll see.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.687
Did you catch anything?

44:50.187 --> 44:52.022
Not yet, but soon enough, right?

44:52.106 --> 44:55.317
I'm gonna catch something here
before I leave. Just wait and see.

44:55.401 --> 44:57.277
In honor of our brothers.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.697
Remember, patience.

45:07.996 --> 45:09.498
She gets very nervous.

45:11.166 --> 45:12.751
Yeah. She likes you.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.921
-What?
-She told me.

45:20.926 --> 45:22.970
You really crossed the line, boy.

45:23.971 --> 45:24.805
Sh!

45:29.101 --> 45:30.060
Ready?

45:45.075 --> 45:46.160
Listen to that voice.

46:12.478 --> 46:16.607
Some days went by,
and our plan began to work.

46:19.234 --> 46:21.945
Fake it until you make it.
That's the spirit.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.659
Mateo was about to bite the hook.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.831
Don Claudio! Good morning!

46:38.170 --> 46:40.005
The whole town was participating.

46:45.803 --> 46:46.637
Quecas.

46:47.137 --> 46:48.806
Quesadillas.

46:48.889 --> 46:54.520
But despite our best efforts,
the doctor started feeling very lonely.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.615
You said you'd come in ten days.

47:07.741 --> 47:09.368
Do you know when you'll come?

47:09.451 --> 47:11.078
I don't know, baby.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.082
I miss you, sweetie.

47:15.624 --> 47:16.750
Aw.

47:16.834 --> 47:20.838
Okay, but tell me,
what would you do to me if you were here?

47:22.297 --> 47:24.633
-What would I do to you?
-Yes.

47:25.259 --> 47:28.011
Well, for starters,

47:29.012 --> 47:30.264
I'd kiss your neck.

47:33.100 --> 47:36.562
Then, I'd caress your arms.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.106
Your back.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.232
Yes?

47:40.315 --> 47:41.525
Your legs.

47:42.901 --> 47:44.903
Yes, and what else?

47:44.987 --> 47:46.446
Take your clothes off.

47:55.706 --> 47:56.665
I already did.

47:56.748 --> 47:58.959
-Great.
-What else?

47:59.042 --> 48:00.627
Then

48:01.837 --> 48:03.422
I'd take out my machine.

48:03.505 --> 48:05.048
His machine?

48:05.132 --> 48:06.133
His machine?

48:06.216 --> 48:08.510
What would you do to me
with your machine?

48:10.220 --> 48:11.930
Oh, tell me already.

48:12.014 --> 48:13.557
Tell her. Tell her.

48:14.182 --> 48:15.809
I'd caress your feet.

48:17.769 --> 48:19.021
Her feet?

48:19.855 --> 48:21.189
Is all this relevant?

48:21.273 --> 48:22.274
Yes!

48:24.735 --> 48:25.652
Alba.

48:26.695 --> 48:28.530
What did he mean by his "machine"?

48:29.615 --> 48:30.991
You know, his tool.

48:31.074 --> 48:32.492
-Tool?
-Oh, Consuelo!

48:34.328 --> 48:36.997
Listen to this one. It's my favorite song.

49:40.894 --> 49:42.270
Hello, hello.

49:42.354 --> 49:43.313
What is it?

49:43.397 --> 49:45.732
-Hello, Vera, how are you?
-Germán.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.527
Did you get it or what?

49:55.659 --> 49:56.827
Excuse me.

50:01.289 --> 50:03.125
What? You froze it?

50:03.625 --> 50:05.085
It's not that frozen.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.505
Damn it.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.299
See you.

50:13.218 --> 50:14.261
This fucker.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.520
Patience, patience.

50:23.603 --> 50:24.730
It'll bite soon.

50:36.283 --> 50:37.451
-Germán.
-Huh?

50:38.493 --> 50:39.870
-Is it biting?
-Yes.

50:39.953 --> 50:40.954
-Yes?
-Yes, yes, yes!

50:41.038 --> 50:44.124
Okay. Uh, do I… I reel in?

50:44.207 --> 50:45.125
-Yes, reel it in.
-Okay.

50:45.208 --> 50:47.461
With strength but calmly.
With strength but calmly.

50:47.544 --> 50:49.337
Yes, yes. Pull it.

50:49.421 --> 50:51.214
-It's heavy!
-That's it, with strength.

50:51.298 --> 50:53.133
There it is!

50:53.216 --> 50:54.426
Oh. There it is!

50:57.971 --> 50:59.264
-Well done.
-It's--

50:59.890 --> 51:01.850
It's very… very cold.

51:02.350 --> 51:04.478
-Oh, yes.
-It's frozen.

51:04.561 --> 51:08.023
Yes. That makes it even more special
as it comes from deeper waters.

51:08.106 --> 51:09.608
-Your first fish.
-It's my first fish?

51:09.691 --> 51:11.234
-Your first fish!
-My first fish!

51:12.986 --> 51:15.113
-My first fish. Ah!
-Congratulations!

51:34.841 --> 51:37.511
Here's your catch of the day!

51:37.594 --> 51:39.971
There's the result, eh!

51:40.680 --> 51:44.810
Well, congratulations,
and cheers to your first fish!

51:48.605 --> 51:50.565
Thank you. Thank you.

51:50.649 --> 51:54.653
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
pretty people of Santa María.

51:54.736 --> 51:57.364
Today's a night to celebrate, right?

51:58.115 --> 52:02.452
And what better time to introduce
the group Tormenta Tropical.

52:02.536 --> 52:05.705
And so you won't forget us,
we'll leave you dancing.

52:05.789 --> 52:06.665
Enjoy.

52:11.586 --> 52:13.880
Doc, I made you a drawing.

52:13.964 --> 52:18.426
I hope you like it.
It's you fishing with your first fish.

52:19.678 --> 52:21.930
Thank you so much.

52:43.451 --> 52:47.038
Even in blissful moments
like these, I always thought of María.

52:47.706 --> 52:50.917
How we loved dancing and celebrating
with these beautiful people.

52:52.669 --> 52:53.587
Germán.

52:54.254 --> 52:56.840
Germán! Let's dance, come on.

52:56.923 --> 52:58.550
Yes? Come on!

53:38.215 --> 53:39.090
Germán!

53:39.633 --> 53:41.176
Morning, Anita. What is it?

53:41.259 --> 53:42.302
Aren't you afraid?

53:43.136 --> 53:44.054
What?

53:44.888 --> 53:47.849
That Mateo will find out it's all a lie.

53:47.933 --> 53:51.102
No, no, no. How would he find out, Anita?
We won't tell him.

53:51.186 --> 53:54.147
-We're this close to making it.
-Mm-hmm. This needs to stop.

53:55.023 --> 53:58.360
Anita, we need
that packing company, please.

53:58.443 --> 53:59.903
I know that.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.864
But if Mateo gets hurt, it's not worth it.

54:02.948 --> 54:05.075
Anita, there's no turning back now!

54:07.410 --> 54:08.495
You can count me out.

54:09.871 --> 54:12.624
What do you mean?
Please don't tell him, Anita.

54:13.124 --> 54:15.585
Please. Don't throw away
months of hard work.

54:16.544 --> 54:17.712
Promise me, okay?

54:17.796 --> 54:19.714
Come on. Promise me.

54:20.382 --> 54:22.217
-Don't tell him.
-All right.

54:31.601 --> 54:32.978
They rejected it again.

54:34.062 --> 54:35.438
-Why?
-Why?

54:36.022 --> 54:37.607
It's a very large sum of money.

54:37.691 --> 54:42.112
And, most importantly,
we don't have a specific form for bribes!

54:42.195 --> 54:43.697
Except it's not a bribe.

54:43.780 --> 54:44.698
It is a bribe.

54:44.781 --> 54:45.657
-It isn't.
-It is.

54:45.740 --> 54:47.242
-It isn't!
-Okay, okay.

54:47.325 --> 54:49.494
-Are you really the manager of this bank?
-Yes.

54:49.577 --> 54:51.621
I don't think so.
You sure don't act like one.

54:51.705 --> 54:52.539
-No?
-No.

54:52.622 --> 54:54.582
A bank manager doesn't get bossed around.

54:54.666 --> 54:58.253
No. A bank manager manages,
proposes, takes chances, gets involved.

54:58.336 --> 55:00.380
You doing that? No.
You're no bank manager. You're a--

55:00.463 --> 55:02.257
-Don't say it.
-You're a fucking ATM!

55:02.924 --> 55:03.925
Look at yourself!

55:09.264 --> 55:10.724
This is a classic!

55:14.227 --> 55:16.229
I like it. It's not bad.

55:20.442 --> 55:21.568
What happened?

55:24.195 --> 55:25.280
Oh, I fell.

55:26.698 --> 55:28.491
Yes, but who stitched you up?

55:29.326 --> 55:33.747
Well, since Santa María is
five hours from the nearest hospital…

55:34.956 --> 55:36.791
since we have no other choice, well…

55:37.500 --> 55:39.669
The freaking butcher.
Can you believe that?

55:40.879 --> 55:42.047
He stitches them up

55:42.130 --> 55:45.175
'cause he's the one who knows the most
about human anatomy.

55:45.258 --> 55:47.385
I don't even know if he washes his hands.

55:48.011 --> 55:50.096
After butchering pigs,
he stitches human beings.

55:51.514 --> 55:53.266
The butcher stitches humans?

55:53.350 --> 55:55.977
Well, it's… it's a possibility.

56:03.777 --> 56:06.363
Everybody deserves access to a doctor.

56:06.446 --> 56:07.280
Lucía.

56:07.781 --> 56:09.824
-Yes?
-Are you listening to me?

56:09.908 --> 56:11.659
It's just I'm running late.

56:11.743 --> 56:12.619
Oh.

56:13.286 --> 56:16.831
I'm sorry to bother you
with my small-town problems.

56:16.915 --> 56:18.500
I'll call you tonight, okay?

56:19.000 --> 56:19.918
Okay.

56:21.044 --> 56:21.920
Bye.

56:24.381 --> 56:26.591
Let's see how you get her to move here.

56:34.724 --> 56:35.558
Mau?

56:36.393 --> 56:38.812
-Mau is his best friend.
-From the hospital.

56:39.771 --> 56:40.605
Champ!

56:41.106 --> 56:44.776
Do me a solid.
Could you record Saturday's match?

56:46.194 --> 56:47.779
Dude, can't you watch it there?

56:47.862 --> 56:48.988
No, dude.

56:49.072 --> 56:51.449
It… it must be a match
for American football.

56:51.533 --> 56:52.617
Oh, yes.

56:52.700 --> 56:56.996
Who has one of those device things
to… to watch TV channels?

56:57.080 --> 56:57.997
Susy.

56:58.081 --> 57:00.417
Susy has a device with all the channels.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.210
She brought it from the States.

57:02.293 --> 57:04.587
Let's use it Saturday at the restaurant.

57:04.671 --> 57:05.880
-Okay.
-How's it going?

57:05.964 --> 57:06.881
Hey.

57:07.674 --> 57:08.758
Have you seen Lucía?

57:09.634 --> 57:10.510
Why?

57:11.511 --> 57:13.221
Just because--

57:13.805 --> 57:15.723
I don't know. She's been acting weird.

57:16.349 --> 57:17.225
I don't know.

57:17.809 --> 57:19.394
You mind keeping an eye on her?

57:22.564 --> 57:23.398
Oh, okay.

57:23.481 --> 57:25.692
Yes, yes, yes.
Don't worry. I'll watch her.

57:26.317 --> 57:29.487
Turns out, the packing company called,
and there's a problem.

57:29.571 --> 57:32.073
But calm down! Hey, calm down!

57:32.991 --> 57:35.660
The good news is we can solve it

57:35.743 --> 57:39.247
if, and only if, we work together.

57:40.582 --> 57:42.208
So listen up. Here's the plan.

57:45.211 --> 57:46.838
Welcome, Mr. Hernández.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.215
Welcome to Santa María.

57:50.508 --> 57:51.342
Thank you.

57:57.348 --> 58:02.687
Yes, but the census says Santa María
has 110 inhabitants.

58:02.770 --> 58:05.940
Oh, it must, you know,
be a technical mistake.

58:06.024 --> 58:07.817
Listen, who are you going to believe?

58:07.901 --> 58:12.071
Some numbers or someone who was born,
raised, and still lives here?

58:13.656 --> 58:17.994
To complete our project
and have it be a priority,

58:18.077 --> 58:23.166
we require
at least 210 people living here.

58:23.249 --> 58:24.542
I'm aware.

58:24.626 --> 58:27.921
Listen, do you think
if we weren't 225 in the town,

58:28.004 --> 58:29.422
I'd be doing all of this?

58:35.386 --> 58:38.806
Honestly,
I don't know what to say.

58:40.767 --> 58:42.685
Okay. Look. Look, look, look.

58:43.645 --> 58:45.396
How many people do you see here?

58:45.939 --> 58:49.150
Just guess. No need for an exact number.

58:53.071 --> 58:56.157
About 100 or maybe 120.

58:56.866 --> 58:59.202
-Okay, come with me, please.
-Uh…

58:59.285 --> 59:00.411
Come with me.

59:03.248 --> 59:04.249
This way.

59:09.337 --> 59:10.421
Careful, okay?

59:11.297 --> 59:12.924
-This way?
-Yes, this way.

59:14.008 --> 59:14.926
Thank you.

59:15.009 --> 59:16.094
Let's go!

59:17.303 --> 59:18.555
Hurry up!

59:26.104 --> 59:27.230
What's going on?

59:32.902 --> 59:34.487
It's 8:00. Time for the soap opera.

59:43.329 --> 59:44.872
Hurry! Ah!

59:45.373 --> 59:47.625
Come on, come on. To your places!

59:49.335 --> 59:51.838
-Oh, sorry!
-Hurry! Hurry!

59:52.672 --> 59:55.300
Pass the boards and the beans.

59:55.925 --> 59:56.801
Hurry up!

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.473
-The drunkard!
-Bingo!

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:06.102
Apologies, you carry on.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.896
And here, how many do you see?

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:12.984
I don't know. Maybe 100.

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.694
Yes, 100. Yeah, right?

01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:17.530
There it is. Hmm? Right.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.536
Good job.

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:42.096
Okay, Germán.
I now see you were telling the truth.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.182
We can officially resume the project.

01:00:44.265 --> 01:00:47.352
Have you discussed my personal guarantee?

01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:51.356
Oh, yes, we have,
and it arrives this week. No problem.

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:53.941
-Excellent.
-Let me walk you to the yacht.

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:55.652
Where's the restaurant?

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.614
Uh, the restaurant?
What for? Why?

01:00:59.697 --> 01:01:01.366
Uh, I left my hat.

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:04.202
Oh, don't worry.
I'll get it. Let me get it.

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:07.330
No, no need. I'll go get it.
Where's the restaurant?

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:11.042
Okay. Straight all the way there.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:11.959
-Over there?
-Yeah.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.336
-Thank you.
-Yes.

01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:15.713
-I'll wait here.
-Yes, yes.

01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:21.469
Everybody, to the restaurant!

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:23.971
Hip, hip, hip.

01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:36.776
Doc! Doc!

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:41.406
Margarita. Margarita. Margarita.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:54.001
Where did everyone go?

01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:57.714
It's past 8:00.
They're watching the soap opera.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.135
Ah.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.308
That's my hat.

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:15.648
But was it like, "Ah"?

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:19.819
Or was it more like, "Aah"?

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:22.822
-No, it was like, "Ah."
-Huh?

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:24.574
-And?
-Oh.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.952
If I'd known, I'd have paid more attention
to the damn "Ah."

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:30.747
So?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.669
The bank rejected the loan again.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.421
-Ooh.
-Eh.

01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:41.048
So you are an ATM.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.261
What a great receiver!

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:47.555
Amazing.

01:02:48.055 --> 01:02:49.432
-Excellent.
-Yes!

01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:51.851
-Yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes!
-Yes, yes, yes!

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.519
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.562
Yes!

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:56.189
First and ten.

01:02:57.815 --> 01:02:59.233
What a great play.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.359
Awesome.

01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:03.321
-I gotta pee.
-Go ahead.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.825
-Both of them?
-They're moving over there.

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:13.206
I can't take more of this, eh?
This is worse than rock music!

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:15.208
I don't understand a damn thing.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.918
This is impossible to understand.

01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:19.170
I mean,
how can they call this a sport, huh?

01:03:19.712 --> 01:03:21.881
You have to be idiots
to be running around like--

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:23.216
Sh! Don't be so loud!

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:25.134
-Chuy.
-Yes?

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:26.093
Switch to soccer.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:28.179
Margarita, change the channel.

01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:29.096
Hurry up.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.600
This match determines…

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:37.271
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:41.359
Yes!

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.570
Goal!

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.618
Sh! Sh! No! Enough! Sh!

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.581
He's coming! Change the channel.
Margarita, change it!

01:03:56.999 --> 01:04:00.753
Goal? What do you mean "goal"?
Wait, What-- What did I miss?

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.882
Well, yeah, see what happened is--
The kicker kicked.

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:08.803
He kicked, and boom! We got a point.

01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:11.681
Extraordinary. Beautiful, great play.

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:16.853
And the running back ran
because he runs. And bam! Another point!

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.437
It was incredible.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.273
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.401
-Benjamín.
-Hmm?

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:28.698
-You are very drunk.
-Oh.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.451
Yes, very drunk.

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:36.706
Rooster!

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:48.509
No, no, no, this can't be true!
This can't be true!

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:54.515
Every fucking time I come here,
I find money!

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.604
-Lucky.
-That's great luck.

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:01.939
I need some of that luck.

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:03.441
Benjamín.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.152
Just shut up!

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:10.740
No, no, no, no.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:12.783
We're all great here.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:14.285
It's a great day.

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:15.703
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

01:05:15.786 --> 01:05:17.079
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.874
No, no. Cheers to Santa María!

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:21.417
Cheers!

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.085
World's Heritage Site!

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:24.378
Santa María.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:28.549
The fish bit the hook.

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:32.595
You hear what he said?
"We're doing great here."

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:35.640
He said that.
I can tell he likes money, eh?

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.184
It's working.

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:39.769
No.

01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:41.646
No, no.

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:45.942
If we ask Mateo to sign now, he'll say no.

01:05:46.567 --> 01:05:48.444
Now is the most difficult part.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.697
Making the fish bite the hook is easy.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:53.449
Convincing it

01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:56.994
that life is better here,
that's the tricky part!

01:05:57.078 --> 01:06:02.458
Now, if the fish is convinced,
it will jump by itself into the boat.

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:04.377
By itself, you see.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.298
What do we do now?

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.099
Lencho.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.102
Are you free for the next two hours?

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.813
We'll buy you a mescal.

01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:32.071
-All right, we should toast.
-Cheers!

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.740
Dr. Salas, welcome to Santa María.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.248
-Hi, Margarita.
-Hi.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:43.541
What's up, Jorge?

01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:45.251
Um, could I get a beer, please?

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.335
Yes.

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.462
Hey, who is he?

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:50.756
A doctor.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.134
He's applying to be our permanent doctor.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:55.886
I heard he's signing on for five years.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:57.680
They say he's the best.

01:06:57.763 --> 01:07:00.599
Margarita. Mateo, good to see you.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.059
Need another round, please.

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:05.187
Hey, I forgot to tell you.
You have tomorrow off.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.565
Okay? Dr. Salas will cover it.

01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:09.942
-Thank you.
-Okay.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.236
Hey, so should we go fishing?

01:07:12.903 --> 01:07:14.613
-When? Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:15.823
Yeah, sure.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.166
…thirteen, fourteen, fifteen…

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.335
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:30.921
Everybody will have a turn.
Be patient. Who's next?

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:32.465
Nice.

01:07:33.924 --> 01:07:34.925
What's up?

01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:36.719
Are you ready to go?

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:39.138
Man, I forgot. I'm sorry.

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:42.683
I have a hectic day with Dr. Salas,
who's taking appointments here.

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:43.768
Look at the line.

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:47.146
Ah. Okay.

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:49.940
-Well, maybe next time.
-Yes.

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:53.069
This time, catching a fish
wouldn't be as easy as the last time.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:55.196
Sometimes, the end justifies the means.

01:07:55.279 --> 01:07:59.492
The faith of Santa María was in our hands,
and we were in too deep.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:02.787
Hello. I'm calling today
because you're rejecting a--

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.246
LOAN APPLICATION
REJECTED

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.249
…a loan I consider to be secure!

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.961
Benjamín,
I'm looking at the form right now.

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:12.963
It's in Santa María.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:15.382
There's no guarantee whatsoever.

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:21.639
Well, if I may,
I've been working 18 years for you. I…

01:08:21.722 --> 01:08:23.974
Your job right now
is to pay the subsidies.

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:27.019
It's simple.
That's the only thing we ask from you.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.064
Okay, but I'd like to…

01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:33.776
I don't want to minimize all these years

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:37.446
but remember, we could replace you…

01:08:39.406 --> 01:08:40.241
Don't say it.

01:08:40.324 --> 01:08:41.492
…with an ATM.

01:08:41.575 --> 01:08:42.535
You said it.

01:09:05.724 --> 01:09:06.725
What's that?

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.185
It's our loan.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.230
Did… did they approve it?

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.942
No, no, no. I approved it.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.153
How? How'd you…

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:19.947
We have to save
a lot of money to pay it back,

01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:22.283
but the packing company will get us there.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:27.621
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:31.667
Germán.

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:35.337
-What is this?
-It's my résumé.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.673
I'm going to need a new job soon.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.223
Thanks a lot, man. Thank you so much!

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.437
Thanks a lot, man.

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:54.481
I'm glad everything's working out.

01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:56.859
So come back.

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:00.946
I miss you, Germán.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:05.367
Hey, are you still mad at me?

01:10:07.077 --> 01:10:08.662
-Hello?
-María.

01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:10.080
Hmm?

01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:12.249
What are you wearing?

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.800
The red dress you gave me for my birthday.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:23.719
And underneath?

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:26.847
What?

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:32.770
Underneath, what are you wearing?

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.741
-How was it?
-Okay, look.

01:10:46.533 --> 01:10:49.161
Mateo calls Lucía, and she's not home.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.204
Exactly.

01:10:50.287 --> 01:10:53.207
So he left her a long message.

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.375
Yes.

01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:56.210
Then he starts talking about feet.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.545
Don't forget the machine.

01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:01.006
Well, that was a bit confusing.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:03.509
He also talked about his oil.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.970
-Okay. Get to the point!
-Wait, hold on!

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:09.932
She was at his best friend's house. Mau.

01:11:10.015 --> 01:11:10.849
Mau.

01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:12.518
His best friend.

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.020
-Best friend!
-Apparently, also hers.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.981
There's no doubt about it.

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:22.528
Basically, for the last three years,
she's been cheating on him.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:24.321
With his best friend!

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:25.948
Mau, three years.

01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:27.199
Three years!

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:28.325
Ooh!

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:31.036
After finding out, they broke up.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:31.996
They broke up?

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:33.664
They broke up?

01:11:33.747 --> 01:11:35.541
They broke up for real.

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:36.959
There you go!

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.753
He has no reason to stay there.

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:42.256
He can stay here with us!

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:44.591
That's what we were thinking!

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:45.759
That's right.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.886
Well, cheers!

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:48.887
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.640
-Drinking alone or what?
-No, come on. No way. No way.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.559
Ay, ay, ay, ay. There you go.

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:54.476
-Okay
-For you.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.894
Say it now. Cheers.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:04.820
Mateo.

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:08.657
Tough day or what?

01:12:10.242 --> 01:12:11.869
I broke up with Lucía.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:16.915
Why? What happened?

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:20.794
During all this time…

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.679
…with my best friend.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.602
How could I not realize
they were together?

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:41.065
My other friends surely knew.

01:12:41.565 --> 01:12:43.025
Fucking lies everywhere.

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:47.404
-Can you imagine?
-Hmm.

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:50.616
I must have been the butt of the joke
for them this whole time.

01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:03.295
I'm going to bed, Germán.

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:06.548
Okay, careful.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:29.321
Simón.

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:32.157
Simón!

01:13:54.888 --> 01:13:55.889
Simón.

01:13:57.808 --> 01:13:58.976
Who are you?

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.937
A ghost.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.525
It's Germán, idiot.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.778
I thought so.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:13.115
He's gonna sign.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.955
Germán. Good night.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.249
Good night, Vera.

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:23.792
Will you take long?

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:26.295
No, I won't. I'll be brief.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:32.134
Why don't you and your
conspiracy theories go to your house?

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:33.635
Simón.

01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:38.140
Have you thought of
what will happen after he signs?

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:45.689
Have you wondered what will happen
when he finds out who we really are?

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:49.359
That everything's fake.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.572
That we have been lying to him

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:55.574
for a month.

01:14:57.367 --> 01:14:58.744
A whole month, Simón.

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:02.247
They're white lies.

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:04.500
But all lies,

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:08.921
white, big ones, it's the same.

01:15:09.796 --> 01:15:11.548
They hurt, Simón.

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:21.558
Okay, we have two options.

01:15:22.142 --> 01:15:25.604
We drop our elaborate plan
and forget about this great seduction,

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:31.235
or we keep this up every single day
for the next five years

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:34.780
and continue to be the town
Dr. Mateo thinks we are.

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:37.991
No! I won't listen to rock for five years.

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:40.452
What?

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.580
I dare all of you
to listen to that loud noise every day!

01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:46.708
Oh, pure Virgin Mary!

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.669
Conceived without sin.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.673
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't want to interrupt.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:56.718
-I just-- I didn't know that--
-No, no. Don't worry, Mateo. Don't worry.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:01.056
Well, I, um,

01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:03.308
I just wanted…

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:06.395
I wanted to say that,

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:09.481
even though
it's been hard for me to adapt,

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.108
this past month,

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:16.655
I discovered that, in Santa María,
there's something truly authentic.

01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:20.367
You're all authentic.

01:16:22.202 --> 01:16:24.121
And that's really hard to find.

01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:28.875
I don't need to ask you all
how you're doing.

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:30.961
You just know.

01:16:32.045 --> 01:16:33.463
Looking into your eyes

01:16:34.214 --> 01:16:35.841
and your honest smiles.

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:37.968
Transparent.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.053
They are real.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.601
That's about it.

01:16:46.643 --> 01:16:50.731
Um, what I'm saying is, if possible…

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:55.986
I'd like to be your doctor.

01:17:04.911 --> 01:17:06.204
Thanks a lot, Mateo.

01:17:07.664 --> 01:17:08.498
But…

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:13.211
Uh, the thing is, we've

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.214
signed with the other doctor.

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:22.346
Why did he do that?

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:25.140
Because he cares.

01:17:26.224 --> 01:17:27.309
I'm very sorry.

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:29.978
I'm really very sorry.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:32.814
No, no, I get it.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:38.487
Well, uh, I'll be going now.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:26.660
I've come to say goodbye.

01:18:27.911 --> 01:18:30.330
I'd have liked
to get to know you better.

01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:38.004
Germán told me about your feelings.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:41.591
How you feel

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:43.719
about me.

01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:47.013
And how do I feel?

01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:52.519
Germán said you were interested in me.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.440
Germán.

01:19:01.945 --> 01:19:02.821
Mateo,

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:06.158
they're lying.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.663
We're all lying.

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:16.835
Not everything you've lived here
has been real and honest.

01:19:28.388 --> 01:19:30.432
And the doctor's contract?

01:19:30.515 --> 01:19:34.144
The… the contract?
I… We've already sent it.

01:19:34.227 --> 01:19:35.854
No, no, I didn't get anything.

01:19:36.354 --> 01:19:37.898
You should have a copy, at least, right?

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:39.941
Yeah, well, here's the cop--

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.029
Someone's looking for you.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.952
What's a touchdown in American football?

01:19:52.078 --> 01:19:53.580
What? Well, it's--

01:19:53.663 --> 01:19:54.831
You have no idea.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.752
You lied to me this whole time?

01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:01.505
-No, no, Mateo--
-How did Germán's brother die?

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:04.508
Uh… at childbirth.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.176
Childbirth?

01:20:06.259 --> 01:20:07.135
No?

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:08.178
Why, Germán?

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.807
Why can't anybody tell me the truth?

01:20:13.725 --> 01:20:15.227
It's true, Mateo. It's true.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.896
Look, I-- Wait a sec, Mateo.

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.314
Just wait. Mateo!

01:20:21.566 --> 01:20:22.484
Mateo!

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:24.820
Mateo, wait. Mateo, listen to me.

01:20:27.405 --> 01:20:30.158
The soul of this town
has been crushed for years, Mateo.

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:36.039
As if someone had wrung us.
As if they had drained our essence.

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:41.586
I mean, my greatest joy is to cash a check
that isn't under my name.

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.172
You know what comes
with that monthly check?

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:45.632
Pure shame.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.345
Towns like this get forgotten.

01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.889
They take our fish, our livelihood.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.851
They take away everything from us.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:58.436
The truth is

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:00.981
without a doctor, it's over.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:06.653
The reality is I didn't know how
I could get one to help only 120 people.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:08.864
Did he say 120?

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.116
220.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.160
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth,

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:17.622
but it was to save Santa María's life.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.551
We don't want a doctor.

01:21:31.761 --> 01:21:33.221
We want you, Mateo Suárez.

01:22:47.253 --> 01:22:49.631
-Is everything all right, Doc?
-Yes, everything's all right.

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.633
Where are you headed to?

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:55.720
I will stay here.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:58.974
The engine broke down.

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:02.769
Such is life.

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:06.773
Every day I part from here,

01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:11.861
and I've never stopped
to watch the sun set on the town, man.

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:14.906
Just look at that beauty!

01:23:16.616 --> 01:23:17.784
Without a doubt,

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.495
when life stops us in our tracks,

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:24.499
that's when we can see
the true beauty of things.

01:23:26.292 --> 01:23:28.670
We take for granted
whatever we think is pretty,

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:32.632
but we sometimes forget that
the sun shines even behind the clouds.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.260
Don't you think, Doc?

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:09.294
What happened?

01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:12.839
You willing to learn American football?

01:24:17.427 --> 01:24:18.261
No.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.433
Deal.

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:25.268
I'll be your doctor.

01:24:33.109 --> 01:24:33.943
Bravo!

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:38.740
Pour him one!

01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:43.787
Pour him one!

01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:48.958
The doc!
The doc! The doc!

01:24:50.126 --> 01:24:51.461
Long live the Doc!

01:25:56.192 --> 01:25:58.486
SANTA MARÍA FISH-PACKING COMPANY

01:26:08.788 --> 01:26:11.666
The first thing we did
was pay off the bank loan.

01:26:11.749 --> 01:26:13.001
Benjamín's name was cleared,

01:26:13.084 --> 01:26:15.587
and Santa María
was forever indebted to him.

01:26:17.755 --> 01:26:21.384
In the end, the fish-packing company
changed our lives for the better.

01:26:22.218 --> 01:26:23.970
We have what we rightfully deserve,

01:26:24.053 --> 01:26:27.015
and there's enough
to go around for everyone.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.851
When things seemed bleak,

01:26:29.934 --> 01:26:32.604
and it looked like
we were going to lose it all,

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:35.064
we banded together as one.

01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:38.234
The Santa María way, damn it!

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.778
120 people working together

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:43.531
is worth far more than 1 million
who are at odds with each other.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:47.243
Unfortunately for Mateo,
we never played American football again.

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:48.494
Goal!

01:26:51.122 --> 01:26:53.291
With Ana's help,
the school reopened,

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:57.420
and the children are dreaming of becoming
doctors, engineers, and astronauts.

01:26:57.503 --> 01:26:59.589
-Yeah?
-Yes! He's almost here.

01:27:06.846 --> 01:27:09.766
Life in our slice of heaven
once again made sense.

01:27:10.683 --> 01:27:13.937
The new company brought back not only jobs
but family members as well.

01:27:18.441 --> 01:27:20.735
-You haven't changed a bit!
-You too.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:24.197
-This is my brother Pablo.
-Hi.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.990
María. It's a pleasure.

01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:30.536
I'm back with my family.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:37.502
At the end of a workday,
when it hurts even to blink,

01:27:38.878 --> 01:27:41.339
I can't explain the joy one feels

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:43.508
to come back home.

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:46.427
And despite the long work day,

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:49.597
I still have energy left for other things.

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:54.727
We might not be rich,

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:59.691
but I can assure you
that we're happy and feel truly blessed.

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:07.907
Fishing, job security,
love, family, friends.

01:28:08.408 --> 01:28:10.201
Along with dazzling starry nights

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.662
that illuminate this beautiful town
I call home.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:17.625
What more could we ask for?

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:23.548
THE GREAT SEDUCTION
