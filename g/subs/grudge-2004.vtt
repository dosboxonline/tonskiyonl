01:34.344 --> 01:35.762
Good morning.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.725
Peter, are you okay?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.374
You're up early today.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.634
CURSE - GRUDGE

04:16.423 --> 04:17.882
Hi.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.177
Excuse me.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.225
Hi, Emma.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.312
It's good to see you again.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.985
Do you remember me?

04:39.154 --> 04:40.529
It's Yoko.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.632
- Sorry. Did I wake you?
- Bottom drawer.

08:38.602 --> 08:39.934
Thank you.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.438
- You know me so well.
- Come back to bed.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.609
I can't. I'm gonna be late
for my architecture midterm.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.278
Check your watch.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.580
I set the clock an hour ahead last night.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.128
Maybe you know me too well.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.721
I'm really glad you decided
to come here with me.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.474
- Me, too.
- You sure?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.143
Of course. Why?

09:22.145 --> 09:25.731
- It's a big deal, you know.
- Lots of people go abroad.

09:27.025 --> 09:31.028
Besides, you've been dreaming
about coming here forever.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.530
I'm just glad we could be together.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.248
- Don't you have class today?
- Nope.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.001
Just have to pick up a book
I left at the Care Center.

09:46.086 --> 09:50.381
Come on, you could spare 10 minutes.
I promise I'll get you to class on time.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.218
- Where are you going?
- Come here. I wanna show you something.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.643
It's a Buddhist ritual.

10:44.728 --> 10:48.564
The incense smoke carries the prayers
to the spirits of their ancestors.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.357
It's to help them find peace.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.947
They must have lost someone they loved.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.455
Excuse me.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.666
Come on.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
Karen?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.012
- Karen?
- Yes, Alex?

11:21.139 --> 11:24.725
- Are you free this afternoon?
- Just a test to study for. Why?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.063
Your wish has been granted.
Your first visit alone.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.358
Just make sure she has what she needs
and help out around the house.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.779
It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up
for work this morning.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.990
I can't get her on the phone.
She must be sick or something.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.160
And she has the damn house key.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.622
What's this phrase?

11:47.749 --> 11:51.794
That's "severe lethargy
with mild dementia."

11:53.880 --> 11:58.383
Apparently, she sleeps
through most of the day.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.637
Her daughter-in-law doesn't work,
so she'll probably be there.

12:02.639 --> 12:06.100
It's an English-language house,
so you should be fine.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.060
Here's the address.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.145
You can use the wall chart
if you need help

12:10.230 --> 12:13.440
and don't forget to bring a map, okay?

12:17.112 --> 12:19.738
Don't worry, Karen. You're ready.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.241
Excuse me...

13:04.325 --> 13:06.827
I'm looking for this house.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.581
I think it's that way.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.222
Hello?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.911
Is anybody here?

15:32.932 --> 15:36.101
Oh, my God. Are you all right? Come here.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.664
Okay, Emma.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.252
My name's Karen Davis.

16:03.713 --> 16:08.467
I'm from the Care Center.
I'm substituting for Yoko, just for today.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.976
Looks like you need a new bandage.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.608
How did that happen, Emma?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.694
Hello?

18:36.407 --> 18:40.535
Yes, he was shut in the closet.
There was tape all around the door.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.456
They're not home yet.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.878
I don't know.
Emma still hasn't said a word to me.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.174
No, he won't come down.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.843
Yes, I'm sure he's Japanese.

18:59.513 --> 19:03.600
I know. I'm sorry, Alex. Okay.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.144
Just get here as soon as you can.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.472
Toshio.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.517
Toshio.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.366
Matthew and Jennifer aren't around.
Leave a message.

21:26.118 --> 21:30.413
Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.793
Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell

21:34.877 --> 21:37.087
or give me a call at home later.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.216
I just want to make sure Mom's okay.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.593
So just call me when you can, okay?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.334
Emma.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.260
Who are you talking to?

22:32.434 --> 22:35.145
I just want her to leave me alone.

22:38.941 --> 22:42.110
You need to get some rest, okay?

23:08.762 --> 23:08.928
LOOKING FOR OCCUPANT
Happy Home Sect. Ltd.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.181
LOOKING FOR OCCUPANT
Happy Home Sect. Ltd.

23:30.576 --> 23:33.161
Welcome. What do you think?

23:36.165 --> 23:37.540
Your shoes.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.170
- Even in your own house?
- Even in your own house.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.593
It's perfect for Mom.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.430
She won't even have to
deal with the stairs.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.567
- Hey, where's Mom?
- I'll look for her.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.251
Mom?

25:05.546 --> 25:06.587
Mom?

25:15.097 --> 25:18.891
Come on, Mom.
You know what the doctor said about stairs.

25:20.477 --> 25:23.062
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.647
Hey, Mom.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.443
What?

25:29.403 --> 25:32.113
Mom, are you all right?

26:51.819 --> 26:53.319
Suzuki-san?

26:55.280 --> 27:00.243
- We'll take it.
- Okay.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.263
Morning.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.056
Morning.

28:05.475 --> 28:09.061
I hope Mom's okay.
She's been sleeping ever since we got here.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.731
Not at night.

28:13.650 --> 28:16.777
I've told you, Matthew,
you can sleep through anything.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.113
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

28:19.531 --> 28:23.034
I'm sure it was just the move.
She'll get back on schedule.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.955
- Have you seen my travel mug?
- I haven't unpacked it yet.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.254
Maybe you should say something
to the helper.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.298
- What's her name?
- Yoko.

28:37.591 --> 28:40.885
Who knows?
Maybe she can suggest something.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.261
Maybe.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.807
I miss seeing this.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.231
I guess now we're
gonna have to talk in the morning.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.778
Hey, kiddo, you okay?

29:02.115 --> 29:04.742
Jen? Sorry, honey, are you all right?

29:08.372 --> 29:09.789
What's up?

29:14.419 --> 29:16.420
I went for a walk yesterday.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.172
Just to explore.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.593
And I got so lost.

29:24.137 --> 29:28.182
And I couldn't find anyone
who spoke English that could help me.

29:32.479 --> 29:35.481
This will get easier soon. I promise.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.278
Or else?

29:44.283 --> 29:47.535
Or else I tell the company
it's just not working out.

29:47.995 --> 29:51.664
And we're going back to the States
with or without my old job.

29:54.418 --> 29:57.503
They can find somebody else
to crunch their numbers.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.549
But until then,

30:02.843 --> 30:06.470
promise me you'll give it a good try,
okay, Jen?

30:07.514 --> 30:09.015
Deal.

31:26.927 --> 31:30.054
If you want something,
all you have to do is say so.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.827
Who's there?

33:22.292 --> 33:23.542
Hey, Jen?

33:25.462 --> 33:26.462
Jen?

33:45.065 --> 33:46.899
What the hell...

33:51.404 --> 33:52.738
Mom?

33:56.910 --> 33:58.619
Are you all right?

34:01.748 --> 34:03.541
Mom, where's Jennifer?

34:15.219 --> 34:16.719
Come on.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.097
Hey, Jen?

34:23.478 --> 34:24.937
You scared...

34:27.940 --> 34:30.275
Jen? Honey?

34:33.280 --> 34:36.407
Honey, what is it? What's wrong?

34:40.370 --> 34:43.956
What happened? Honey, what is it?

34:44.748 --> 34:45.748
What?

34:50.880 --> 34:53.424
Honey, I'm gonna call an ambulance,
all right?

34:58.638 --> 35:06.638
Who are you? What are you doing here?

36:26.017 --> 36:28.602
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.399
Karen?

36:41.950 --> 36:43.492
Mrs. Williams.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.538
Mrs...

36:54.045 --> 36:55.045
Karen?

36:57.841 --> 36:58.841
Karen!

37:10.437 --> 37:11.478
INVESTIGATION

37:26.703 --> 37:30.205
I am Detective Nakagawa.
This is Detective Igarashi, my assistant.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.415
Hi.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.668
Is Karen okay?

37:36.337 --> 37:37.963
She is very shaken.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.967
We would like her to stay
in the hospital tonight under evaluation.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.596
Do you know these people?

37:48.850 --> 37:54.062
Yeah, that's Matthew Williams
and his wife, Jennifer.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.443
He's the son of the woman
Karen came here to see.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.281
When was the last time you saw them?

38:07.118 --> 38:09.203
When they came in to register.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.122
It's standard procedure,

38:12.373 --> 38:14.416
although the visits were arranged
by his employer.

38:14.501 --> 38:17.628
- I think he works at...
- We've spoken with his employer.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.963
He hasn't shown up for work today.

38:23.009 --> 38:26.595
If you could please come by tomorrow
and make a statement.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.349
The address is there at the bottom.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.607
- Yoko.
- I'm sorry?

38:43.613 --> 38:45.447
Karen's a substitute.

38:45.907 --> 38:48.367
Yoko's the girl
who's normally in charge of Emma.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.912
She's also been missing from work.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.164
For how long?

38:56.668 --> 39:00.087
Since yesterday.
I think I saw her bike outside.

39:23.987 --> 39:28.365
Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.

39:30.034 --> 39:33.453
Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell

39:33.538 --> 39:35.539
or give me a call at home later.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.124
I'm just a little worried about Mom.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.293
I just want to make sure she's okay.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.712
So just call me when you can, okay?

39:43.548 --> 39:47.217
Thursday, 8:27 p.m. End of messages.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.679
That's Matthew's sister.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.472
This must be her.

39:52.557 --> 39:56.393
It seems she works here in Tokyo.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.605
Call her at work, then try home.

39:59.689 --> 40:02.149
If no one answers send someone.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.818
Yes, Sir.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.918
Nagakawa-san...

42:28.212 --> 42:31.006
who does that belong to?

43:07.084 --> 43:09.085
It's okay. I've got you.

43:12.465 --> 43:16.384
Your boss told me what happened.
I'm sorry.

43:21.724 --> 43:24.226
I'm not even sure what did happen.

43:25.561 --> 43:28.188
An old woman passed away in her sleep.

43:28.981 --> 43:32.609
- It's sad, but that's all it is.
- Is that how they're saying she died?

43:40.743 --> 43:42.410
That house.

43:44.622 --> 43:47.249
There was something...

43:54.799 --> 43:56.758
It's okay, Karen.

44:07.395 --> 44:09.437
I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss Davis.

44:10.231 --> 44:13.650
I was wondering if you could answer
some additional questions.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.367
How are you feeling?

44:23.035 --> 44:25.871
Okay. Tired.

44:28.457 --> 44:30.959
- You are an exchange student?
- Yes.

44:32.420 --> 44:35.547
And you have been volunteering
at the Care Center for...

44:35.631 --> 44:39.175
Three months.
I needed a social welfare credit.

44:41.053 --> 44:44.306
You said this was the first time
you'd been in that house?

44:45.808 --> 44:46.808
Yeah.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.731
About the Japanese boy
you said you saw there...

44:52.815 --> 44:55.650
- Did you find him?
- No, not yet.

44:57.653 --> 45:00.447
You said the boy had been taped
into the closet?

45:01.032 --> 45:02.073
That's right.

45:02.950 --> 45:06.494
And there was a book, a journal.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.455
Did it belong to the boy?

45:09.290 --> 45:12.500
I don't think so.
I think it belonged to a woman.

45:15.838 --> 45:17.672
The writing looked feminine.

45:19.175 --> 45:21.885
Did you speak with the boy
after you opened the closet?

45:21.969 --> 45:22.969
Briefly.

45:23.346 --> 45:26.556
I asked his name. He said it was Toshio.

45:34.941 --> 45:36.775
One more question, please.

45:40.029 --> 45:42.238
We found this in the hallway.

45:45.618 --> 45:46.952
This is him.

45:47.036 --> 45:48.328
This is the boy.

45:54.168 --> 45:55.877
Detective Nakagawa?

45:56.545 --> 45:58.797
The whole time I was in that house,

45:59.924 --> 46:01.883
I felt something was wrong.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.223
What happened there?

46:16.941 --> 46:20.318
The bodies of the son and daughter-in-law

46:20.403 --> 46:23.321
of the woman you were caring for
were found in the attic.

46:24.699 --> 46:28.868
It seems that the son killed his wife,
and then himself.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.797
Please excuse me for a moment.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.934
We checked the apartment of Susan,
the sister.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.853
She wasn't there.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.231
And?

46:58.774 --> 47:02.777
It's strange, but the chain lock
had been drawn from the inside.

47:03.029 --> 47:06.239
It seems she did come home
but no one was in the room.

47:11.662 --> 47:15.582
Get the surveillance tapes from where
she works.

47:17.752 --> 47:18.877
They were...

47:20.629 --> 47:25.467
They were the first family
to live in that house...

47:29.221 --> 47:34.100
since the discovery in the
attic three years ago.

47:35.936 --> 47:39.856
Do you know anything about this?

48:00.586 --> 48:02.003
Three years ago.

48:08.010 --> 48:11.721
Matthew and Jennifer aren't around.
Leave a message.

48:13.140 --> 48:17.894
Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.

48:19.605 --> 48:23.483
Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell,

48:23.567 --> 48:25.860
or give me a call at home later.

48:26.570 --> 48:28.113
I'm just a little worried about Mom.

48:28.197 --> 48:30.782
I just want to make sure she's okay.

48:30.866 --> 48:34.035
So just call me when you can, okay?

49:43.522 --> 49:44.564
Matthew?

49:49.612 --> 49:51.362
Matthew, stop it.

50:18.766 --> 50:20.433
Is anyone there?

50:59.515 --> 51:01.140
Excuse me!

51:01.517 --> 51:05.228
Please. There was something on the...

51:05.771 --> 51:09.774
On the tenth floor...

51:10.943 --> 51:13.027
there was something...

51:13.112 --> 51:15.613
something strange.

51:15.698 --> 51:19.200
- Sit down, please.
- Please, just help.

55:06.678 --> 55:07.678
Hello?

55:07.930 --> 55:09.013
It's me.

55:11.558 --> 55:12.558
Matthew.

55:14.895 --> 55:17.271
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm downstairs.

55:17.773 --> 55:19.774
What number are you again?

55:19.858 --> 55:22.151
1601. I'll buzz you in.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.854
I don't know what you're up...

57:25.901 --> 57:27.777
What are you doing here?

57:27.903 --> 57:31.739
I thought they weren't gonna let you go
until tonight. Did you escape?

57:32.532 --> 57:34.825
I just had to get out of there.

57:37.329 --> 57:39.205
I didn't wanna be alone.

57:42.042 --> 57:43.417
Okay, Karen.

57:45.295 --> 57:46.962
Hold on a second.

57:49.174 --> 57:52.927
I was wondering if I could
take the rest of the day off?

58:08.318 --> 58:11.654
Karen? Karen.

58:17.577 --> 58:19.412
What's wrong?

58:22.541 --> 58:23.541
Hey.

58:25.585 --> 58:27.420
Talk to me.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.428
I think I saw something in that house.

58:38.014 --> 58:40.182
Emma and I were alone in that room,

58:42.894 --> 58:45.604
but I think there was something else
there with us.

58:47.524 --> 58:48.941
Karen, what is it?

58:51.319 --> 58:52.319
Karen.

58:59.244 --> 59:01.844
I just wanna go home.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:29.583
Hello?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.560
Yoko?

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.899
What happened, Yoko?

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:54.491
My name is Karen Davis.
I'm really sorry to bother you.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:58.287
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:00.747
Questions about what?

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.500
I realize this is really awkward.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.378
I'm here because

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:12.259
I need to ask you a few questions
about your husband.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.975
So, how did you know Peter?

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:27.316
I think there's a connection
between your husband's death

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.318
and something that happened to me.

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:33.155
What happened to you?

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:37.659
It's hard to explain.

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.750
I know this sounds strange,

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.879
but I don't think your husband
wanted to die.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:51.840
Then why would he throw himself
out a window?

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:15.155
Did you know a woman named Kayako?

01:07:17.659 --> 01:07:18.784
No.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:20.827
Did your husband?

01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:23.121
I don't think so.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:25.582
Maybe it was somebody he worked with.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:26.833
Look,

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.545
I have had the police up here,

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:35.676
I've talked to detectives,
I've hired private investigators.

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:38.512
I don't know what you're going through.

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:42.182
I don't have any answers for you.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:43.976
Sorry.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.310
Please.

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:47.646
I don't know what else to do.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:50.357
Please help me.

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:59.074
This is all his stuff from school.

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:05.122
This is from our first date.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.357
My God.

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.069
Peter!

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.154
Hey, Shimizu.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.786
- Happy Monday.
- Yeah, right.

01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:28.371
Here's your mail.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:33.585
- Another one?
- Yeah.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.962
I have no idea.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:38.756
She says she used to be
in one of my classes,

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:41.551
but I don't know who the hell she is.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.929
- Thanks.
- No problem.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:47.140
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:55.565
"Kayako Saeki... Kayako Saeki...
Kayako Saeki"

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.580
Hello?

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.293
Is your mother home?

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:12.809
Hello?

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:23.528
Hi.

01:11:45.509 --> 01:11:47.093
Are you alone here?

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:52.719
Detective Nakagawa,
I need to speak with you.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:58.850
The woman who was murdered in that house
three years ago knew this man.

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:02.103
He committed suicide
the morning after she died.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:05.648
I don't believe he killed himself.

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:10.403
I don't understand. What's happening?

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:14.908
Three years ago,

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:18.078
three of my colleagues, my friends

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.706
began investigating a case.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:26.586
Two died mysteriously,
and one disappeared.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:32.509
They had been investigating the murders
at that house.

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:37.263
Are you saying the detectives died
because of that house?

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:42.852
I've been in that house. So have you!

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.819
It is said in Japan,

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:54.197
that when a person dies
in extreme sorrow or rage,

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.283
the emotion remains,

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.745
becoming a stain upon that place.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:05.333
Death becomes a part of that place,

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.129
killing everything it touches.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.634
Once you have become a part of it,

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:19.389
it will never let you go.

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:34.654
Corpses abandoned in garbage bag

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:35.989
Corpses abandoned in garbage bag

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:48.001
INVESTIGATION - KEEP OUT

01:16:16.488 --> 01:16:20.575
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT
KEEP OUT

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:31.729
Boy!

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.481
Boy!

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:56.671
Doug?

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:46.721
Karen, it's me.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:49.098
Look, where have you been all day?

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:52.268
I'm really worried about you.

01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:54.270
The Care Center called.

01:18:54.354 --> 01:18:56.147
Alex and Yoko are dead.

01:18:57.941 --> 01:18:59.734
I found your research and...

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.153
Did you go to that house?

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.908
I'm coming to find you.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.162
If you get this, stay there.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:13.122
I love you.

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:26.803
Karen?

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.479
Doug?

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:23.317
- Hey. Did you get my message?
- Doug!

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:26.445
I just wanted you to know...

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:10.573
Don't worry,

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:12.033
it isn't any problem.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:14.535
I love you.

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.205
I'll call you before I leave.

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:20.416
I love you.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.211
Ten minutes.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.630
Yeah, I'll be home soon.

01:21:26.798 --> 01:21:28.257
Yeah, love you, too.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:51.899
Guess your mom's gonna be late.

01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:09.968
Doug? Doug?

01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:48.233
Doug?

01:33:05.371 --> 01:33:08.081
Male Caucasian, around mid-20's.

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:11.168
How about the woman in question?

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:13.211
We're sending for her right now.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:20.635
How did she survive?

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:26.308
We're still investigating...

01:33:26.392 --> 01:33:29.019
we were able to save the house.
