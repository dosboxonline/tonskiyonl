00:52.186 --> 00:53.630
Radio host: Hope everybody's
ready to go out

00:53.654 --> 00:54.855
and have a good time
tonight.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.125
It's 8 P.M.,
Saturday evening,

00:57.158 --> 01:00.060
and it's still a hot one.

02:07.261 --> 02:10.264
Officer:
Detail, atten-hut!

02:11.799 --> 02:14.202
Present arms!

02:17.805 --> 02:21.642
Man on radio: Com 2,
this is 5-0. We confirm.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.661
Guard: I.D., please.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.930
First sergeant white,
please proceed.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.299
I believe I will.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.867
Thank you kindly.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.633
Officer: Atten-hut!

03:38.886 --> 03:41.855
Mc: And now I give you
a great general,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.857
a great friend...

03:43.891 --> 03:46.226
"Fighting" Joe Campbell!

03:58.706 --> 04:00.874
At ease!

04:06.380 --> 04:07.681
Thank you, all.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.882
As you know,

04:08.916 --> 04:12.620
my official retirement
isn't until next week.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.623
But this here, now,

04:15.656 --> 04:18.492
tonight with you

04:18.526 --> 04:20.060
is my real retirement.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.996
Because you and i
have known fear together,

04:23.030 --> 04:24.898
shed blood together,

04:24.932 --> 04:27.601
battled pain
and suffering

04:27.635 --> 04:30.003
and all of
their foot soldiers.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.907
We know there is no glamour
in a sudden death

04:33.941 --> 04:36.644
and that no one
ever wins a war,

04:36.677 --> 04:37.911
and it is that knowledge

04:37.945 --> 04:39.913
that will bind us together
forever.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.716
That, and a love
for this country

04:42.750 --> 04:44.952
that no bayonet can Pierce,

04:44.985 --> 04:47.287
no bullet shatter.

04:54.094 --> 04:54.928
To you.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.464
All: To us!

05:12.580 --> 05:13.981
Sergeant white here.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.483
It's colonel Kent,
brenner,

05:15.516 --> 05:16.960
so you can drop
the cheesy Southern accent.

05:16.984 --> 05:17.951
Hey!

05:17.985 --> 05:19.887
The only thing
keeping me alive

05:19.920 --> 05:21.522
is that cheesy
Southern accent.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.957
I was just checking up
on my favorite guest detective.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.092
How you doing?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.427
Oh, well,
you know, bill,

05:26.460 --> 05:27.728
I just love
being undercover.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.962
It's great.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.740
I spent the last 2 weeks
smoking cheap cigars

05:30.764 --> 05:33.501
and sweatin' my ass off
in that shitty houseboat.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.569
Well, you got any sort
of time frame?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.605
Yeah. I'm meeting belling
tonight in the armory,

05:37.638 --> 05:38.848
and then I'll
arrest him on Sunday

05:38.872 --> 05:39.973
when we make
the exchange.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.975
Then I'm going back
to Virginia.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.687
All right, well, good enough.
Watch your back.

05:43.711 --> 05:47.681
Thank you. I believe I will.

05:53.487 --> 05:56.356
Aww, man.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.478
Oww!

06:17.511 --> 06:19.146
Out of gas?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.814
Yeah.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.816
That's why I'm looking
at a flat tire

06:22.850 --> 06:24.685
with a pair of pliers
in my hand

06:24.718 --> 06:26.487
instead of a lug wrench.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.057
Uhh.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.026
Uh-oh. She's a captain.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.062
Uh-oh. She's a captain.

06:35.095 --> 06:39.199
This looks like the work
of 10 chimpanzees.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.168
Well, you just missed
the other 9.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.036
They got bored
and went for a beer.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.772
Hmm. Well,
i have a lug wrench.

06:44.805 --> 06:45.973
Can I try?

06:46.006 --> 06:49.409
Well, if you don't,
I'm gonna drag you over.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.795
Get the spare.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.429
Yes, ma'am.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.976
Golly dang.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.078
If you like piña coladas

07:25.112 --> 07:26.814
and gettin' caught
in the rain,

07:26.847 --> 07:30.150
I may just have to
marry you, captain.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.887
You're gonna have to
take this in.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.556
This spare's
just a temp tire.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.792
Won't be good for more
than 30 miles or so.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.128
Now, where would,
if a fella got courageous

07:41.161 --> 07:44.231
and wanted to send you
a "thank you" notion

07:44.264 --> 07:46.233
or a bauble
or a basket of fruit,

07:46.266 --> 07:48.569
where might one find you?

07:48.602 --> 07:49.903
Psy ops.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.839
How's that?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.106
Psychological
operations.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.474
I teach there.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.477
What do you teach?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.615
Mostly we fuck
with people's minds.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.592
Damn.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.843
Brenner: There you go.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.145
Genuine and made in the usa.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.948
All you gotta do is give
dalbert and me 100,000 each

08:34.982 --> 08:37.918
and you'll see them guns
come Sunday.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.152
Belling:
You'll get your money

08:39.186 --> 08:41.188
same time
i get the guns.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.191
Now, you listen to me,
funny boy,

08:44.224 --> 08:47.895
how do I know you ain't
one of them... them army cops?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.863
Hey,
I'm a freedom fighter.

08:49.897 --> 08:53.166
Well, check it out,
dalbert.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.035
We-doggie!

08:55.068 --> 08:58.038
We got ourselves
che fucking Guevara there.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.173
Whoop-de-doo,
a freedom fighter.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.777
Well, where's your
kooky red hat, boy?

09:03.811 --> 09:05.613
Ain't never been
a freedom fighter worth a gob

09:05.646 --> 09:08.882
ain't got him
a kooky red hat.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.584
You listen to me,
stupid.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.551
Dalbert,

09:11.585 --> 09:14.788
I think it's one of them,
uh, freudian, uh...

09:14.822 --> 09:15.789
Uhh!

09:15.823 --> 09:17.257
What? No.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.192
Aah!

09:19.226 --> 09:20.794
Hey, dalbert.
Dalbert.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.895
What?

09:21.929 --> 09:22.896
Want to hear a joke?

09:22.930 --> 09:23.931
No.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.999
How many freedom fighters

09:26.033 --> 09:28.001
does it take to screw in
a light bulb?

09:28.035 --> 09:29.136
I don't know!

09:29.169 --> 09:31.238
Hey, come on, man.
Relax, huh?

09:31.271 --> 09:34.074
Well, he don't sound like no
criminal investigator to me.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.609
No.
No.

09:35.643 --> 09:36.910
No.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.378
Well,
you're all right, pal!

09:38.411 --> 09:40.313
I'm sorry about all that,
but, you know,

09:40.347 --> 09:44.217
we get a little jumpy
around here before an exchange.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.220
So we'll see you Sunday,
then.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.221
I'll be there.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.259
Yeah, you be there.
All right.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.829
Oh, unclench your
ass cheeks, dalbert.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.832
The scary part is over.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.436
Oh, don't tell me...
You need your oil changed.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.774
Nope. This is a token
of my appreciation.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.883
These are
strange chocolates.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.418
They're bath products.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.754
Bath products.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.088
Bath products?

10:55.122 --> 10:56.289
Mm-hmm.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.825
Should I take a hint?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.893
No, of course not.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.294
Just bath products.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.096
Everybody likes
bath products.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.998
Do you?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.767
Yes, I do.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.036
Really? Tell me what you
like about bath products.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.403
Well, I...

11:10.437 --> 11:12.305
I like the pink soaps,

11:12.339 --> 11:15.175
and I like
the skin softener,

11:15.208 --> 11:16.844
and I like
the bath beads.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.046
I particularly
like the bath beads.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.048
Sometimes I draw a tub,

11:21.081 --> 11:22.315
and I fill that tub

11:22.349 --> 11:24.484
with skin softeners
and bath beads,

11:24.517 --> 11:26.787
and I light
a few candles,

11:26.820 --> 11:29.356
I put on
a little Coltrane,

11:29.389 --> 11:32.125
and I just soak
my troubles away.

11:32.159 --> 11:35.028
Very good,
first sergeant.

11:35.062 --> 11:38.331
I levied a none-too-subtle
accusation of sexism at you,

11:38.365 --> 11:41.134
and you took it 3 times
around the dance floor.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.936
Not really.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.272
I just dig bath beads.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.941
Well, thank you.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.343
Maybe I'll see you around.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.345
Am I being dismissed?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.482
Do you mind terribly?
I've got a ton of work here.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.785
No.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.487
I just, uh, came by
to give you that.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.956
Thank you.
It was sweet.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.391
How's the tire?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.529
Still rollin'. Yeah.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.399
I'm glad.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.069
Good-bye,
first sergeant.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.371
Good-bye, captain.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.218
Anchorwoman on TV:
Having announced his retirement,

13:05.252 --> 13:06.419
general Joseph Campbell

13:06.453 --> 13:08.889
is being considered
for the vice presidency.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.191
Sources close to presidential
candidate bill post

13:11.224 --> 13:14.161
tell us he is poised to select
general Joseph Campbell

13:14.194 --> 13:15.262
as his running mate.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.429
Earlier this year,

13:16.463 --> 13:18.265
the general gave
the commencement address

13:18.298 --> 13:19.867
at west point.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.444
While it was meant to be
a nonpartisan appearance,

13:21.468 --> 13:23.470
it certainly played
like a stump speech.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.238
Campbell on TV:
Leading this country...

13:25.272 --> 13:28.942
That is your destiny.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.116
Anchorwoman: We'll be back
for more in a moment.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.262
Shit!

15:45.312 --> 15:47.080
Aah!

17:14.300 --> 17:15.535
Soldier:
Pretty good.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.837
Get way over
to that car, ok?

17:17.869 --> 17:20.039
Ok.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.115
And take it
into the door.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.594
Ok. Backing out.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.100
Snag.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.435
On what?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.069
I don't know.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.405
Let's take a look.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.758
Deputy:
Paul brenner!

18:11.791 --> 18:13.526
Phone call
for Paul brenner!

18:13.560 --> 18:14.727
What'd you say
your name is?

18:14.761 --> 18:15.728
Frank white.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.197
You military?

18:17.230 --> 18:18.465
Yes, sir, I am.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.433
I'm a sergeant
at the post armory.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.736
Deputy:
Cid agent brenner?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.481
And he walked out,
and the next thing I know,

18:25.505 --> 18:26.673
you know,
he's blasting away.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.741
Oh, you military boys
got stories

18:28.775 --> 18:31.744
more full of holes
than a target range.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.745
Sorry, pop.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.547
It's colonel Kent
at the base.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.915
Is there
a brenner here?

18:35.948 --> 18:36.549
No.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.485
I'm brenner.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.852
I thought you was white.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.222
I'm both.
Skunked ya.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.557
Chief yardley.

18:44.591 --> 18:45.758
Hey, bill.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.628
No, man, it's over.
Belling's dead.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.931
Ok. All right,
I'll see you there.

18:51.964 --> 18:52.699
Thanks.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.202
Yardley: Hold on,
soldier boy.

18:55.235 --> 18:58.471
I want you to tell me
about this Mr. belling.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.773
Soldier boy?

19:00.807 --> 19:03.810
Ok, chiefie,
if you have to know.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.745
I was planning to arrest him
in the morning

19:05.778 --> 19:06.913
during weapons exchange.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.948
But I guess he got wind
that I was part

19:08.981 --> 19:11.951
of the criminal
investigation division.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.254
See ya.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.660
Good morning, sir.
Where to?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.429
Urban warfare site.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.808
You have business there,
sir?

19:25.832 --> 19:26.833
Yes, I do.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.735
Very good, sir.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.419
Hey, bill.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.854
Hello, Paul.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.327
What have we got here?

19:55.728 --> 19:56.996
Kent: Tortured...

19:57.029 --> 19:59.866
Raped...

19:59.899 --> 20:01.434
And murdered.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.569
Mm-hmm.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.474
Who found the body?

20:07.507 --> 20:09.842
A bomb squad crew
doing exercises.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.845
They called the tower,
tower called me.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.881
First on the scene
was a pfc Robbins.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.717
Mm-hmm.
Is he a suspect?

20:17.750 --> 20:20.653
She.
So I sincerely doubt it.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.555
Mm-hmm.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.657
I have 6 of my boys
securing the scene.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.359
Nothing's been touched.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.247
Oh, no.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.418
Kent: What is it, Paul?

20:51.451 --> 20:55.622
I... I met her
the oth... the other day.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.525
Damn.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.893
What a shame.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.330
Lovely, lovely lady.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.900
All right, let's see.
We got, um...

21:07.934 --> 21:11.638
We got some rigor here.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.341
Patechial hemorrhaging,

21:14.374 --> 21:18.511
which is consistent
with asphyxia.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.513
Strangulation,
you think?

21:20.547 --> 21:23.450
Well, I'm assuming that,

21:23.483 --> 21:25.952
but there's no tear
in the panties and...

21:25.985 --> 21:29.922
No obvious sign of semen.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.458
Is that hers?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.059
Yeah.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.036
Why is she here?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.972
Oh, h.Q. Called her.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.941
She's a rape counselor.
Name is Sarah sunhill.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.877
The victim doesn't
need counseling, bill.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.345
She's dead.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.481
Yes, but she's also
a rape investigator.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.949
She was on her way
to another assignment,

21:56.983 --> 21:58.818
and she agreed
to stay on for this.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.453
Aren't we lucky?

22:04.991 --> 22:07.427
Get forensics up here
from fort gillum.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.729
Talk to Cal seiver.
He's the guy I work with.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.130
Get a 50-yard grid
around the body

22:11.163 --> 22:12.965
and make resin casts
of all the boot prints.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.434
Let's see who was
here and when,

22:14.467 --> 22:16.536
including disqualifying prints
of you and yours.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.637
We also need records.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.907
Captain Campbell's personal
and medical records. Asap.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.575
I already did that.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.811
Thank you.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.845
You're welcome.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.014
Uh, Sarah sunhill,
Paul bren...

22:28.047 --> 22:30.717
Also, I want you to book
a sergeant dalbert elkins

22:30.750 --> 22:31.851
at the armory.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.095
He's the one who started
that arms deal

22:33.119 --> 22:34.587
I was working on.

22:34.621 --> 22:35.988
Now...

22:36.022 --> 22:38.991
She walked barefoot
from here to where she died.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.627
Kent: Why do you
assume that?

22:40.660 --> 22:43.162
The smudge marks
on her heels and asphalt.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.864
Now, where does she live?
Victory gardens.

22:44.897 --> 22:45.998
Now, where is that?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.167
I believe
that's off post.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.536
Yeah, well,
i have to go there.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.003
I'll call the burfort
police chief.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.715
He'll get a court order
and meet us out there.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.483
No. That's yardley.
I don't want to work with him.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.747
Let's keep it
in the family, ok?

22:55.775 --> 22:58.010
Now, you can't
search her off-post house

22:58.044 --> 23:00.012
without getting
a civilian search warrant.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.681
Oh, come on, bill.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.452
You need
civilian authority.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.555
Sometimes we got to
protect Paul brenner

23:08.588 --> 23:09.722
from himself.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.825
Does she have
family here?

23:12.859 --> 23:14.026
Of course.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.962
I suggest you notify them
right away.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.766
Officer:
Detail, atten-hut!

23:19.799 --> 23:23.135
Present arms!

23:23.169 --> 23:26.038
You're, uh,
you're kidding, right?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.840
Kidding about what?

23:27.874 --> 23:29.075
It's Elisabeth Campbell,
Paul.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.210
She's his kid.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.780
Oh, no.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.947
Thought you knew.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.516
No, I didn't.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.149
Damn.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.652
The general's daughter.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.053
Yup.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.869
What are you doing?

23:56.903 --> 23:59.438
I feel queasy.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.108
Well, hop on,
I'll burp you.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.877
Drive the car, Paul.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.780
Thought you said
you were queasy.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.983
Drive the car, Paul.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.187
Sunhill: Now, look,

24:15.221 --> 24:16.623
I think I can help you
on this one,

24:16.656 --> 24:18.124
but I don't want it
to be awkward.

24:18.157 --> 24:21.093
Awkward? Now, why would you
think it would be awkward?

24:21.127 --> 24:22.194
You're pouting.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.096
This is not pouting.

24:25.532 --> 24:26.799
Ok.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.535
Sulky petulance, then.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.903
Wrong again.
This is just, uh...

24:30.937 --> 24:33.105
Thinking about Brussels,
you know?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.841
We'll always have Brussels.

24:34.874 --> 24:35.842
Where?

24:35.875 --> 24:38.477
The capital of Belgium.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.113
Why?

24:41.147 --> 24:44.584
Why is it the capital,
or why will we always have it?

24:48.054 --> 24:49.589
Why was she murdered?

24:51.190 --> 24:53.125
Well, possible motives
for murder

24:53.159 --> 24:54.827
are profit, revenge,
jealousy,

24:54.861 --> 24:57.730
to conceal a crime, to avoid
humiliation and disgrace,

24:57.764 --> 25:01.500
or plain old homicidal mania.
Right there in the manual.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.560
Ooh, boy.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.861
Yup.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.335
Brenner: Hello. We're here
to see the general.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.804
Warrant officer
Paul brenner.

25:37.837 --> 25:38.871
Sarah sunhill.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.072
Oh, yes.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.174
I'm captain elby,
the general's aide.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.111
Colonel Fowler,
the general's adjutant,

25:45.144 --> 25:46.345
will take you in.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.314
Please wait right here.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.784
He's cute.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.285
Oh, please.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.922
Probably practices
his salute in the mirror

25:55.955 --> 25:57.657
for hour...

25:57.690 --> 26:00.092
Please, come in.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.094
And thank you
for coming.

26:09.702 --> 26:13.139
General, the cid
investigators are here.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.142
Warrant officers
Paul brenner

26:16.175 --> 26:17.877
and Sarah sunhill, sir.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.813
My deepest condolences,
sir.

26:20.847 --> 26:24.383
Brenner: Very sorry
for your loss, sir.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.318
Thank you.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.121
Please, be seated.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.230
First,
i want you to know

26:38.264 --> 26:40.867
that you have
my full cooperation

26:40.900 --> 26:43.936
and the cooperation
of everyone on this base.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.237
Thank you, sir.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.239
You understand
the time element?

26:47.273 --> 26:50.009
The time element?
No, sir.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.979
After 36 hours, the FBI
will send in a task force

26:53.012 --> 26:54.280
to investigate,

26:54.313 --> 26:57.684
but we prefer to keep this
an army matter.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.252
The general can keep a lid
on it through tomorrow.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.188
Once the FBI moves in,

27:02.221 --> 27:03.990
the media will be
all over this base.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.624
And my daughter's...

27:08.027 --> 27:11.263
Captain Campbell's death...

27:11.297 --> 27:14.000
They'll turn it
into a goddamn circus.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.803
We'll do everything
we can, sir.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.637
I'm sure you will.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.843
Look, let me be blunt.

27:23.876 --> 27:27.146
You're going to have to
decide on this one, Paul...

27:27.179 --> 27:30.282
Are you a soldier
or a policeman?

27:30.316 --> 27:32.819
I'm a soldier, sir.

27:32.852 --> 27:36.889
I'm counting on it.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.794
Sir,
i met your daughter.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.296
Really?

27:44.330 --> 27:45.932
When was that?

27:45.965 --> 27:48.100
Well, it was just
a coincidence,

27:48.134 --> 27:51.470
but, uh, she helped me
change a tire.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.242
That she could do.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.410
She could do
almost anything.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.246
Her mother
was the same way.

28:00.279 --> 28:03.249
Fix a tire, make a hell
of a key lime pie,

28:03.282 --> 28:05.852
speak 5 languages.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.253
Extraordinary woman.

28:07.286 --> 28:11.023
2 extraordinary women.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.696
Goddamn waste.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.513
Again, our deepest
sympathies, sir.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.339
And if there's
anything else

28:27.373 --> 28:28.941
we can do for you
at this time...

28:28.975 --> 28:30.943
Just...

28:34.380 --> 28:37.049
Just find
the son of a bitch.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.717
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.858
Sir?

28:47.393 --> 28:49.361
When I enlisted,
i was underage.

28:49.395 --> 28:54.066
They... they sent me
straight to Vietnam,

28:54.100 --> 28:55.401
and you were
my commander.

28:55.434 --> 28:58.370
You were a captain,

28:58.404 --> 29:02.241
and I... I was so scared.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.976
And one day
when I was on watch,

29:04.010 --> 29:05.244
you came by and...

29:05.277 --> 29:07.546
And... and you saw
the fear. You...

29:07.579 --> 29:10.917
You said, um, "well,
where are you from?"

29:10.950 --> 29:12.551
And I said, "Boston."

29:12.584 --> 29:15.121
And you said, "did you
know that last night

29:15.154 --> 29:17.123
"the Boston Red Sox won

29:17.156 --> 29:19.025
"against
the St. Louis cardinals

29:19.058 --> 29:20.827
in the sixth game
of the series?"

29:20.860 --> 29:24.263
And you just
walked away.

29:24.296 --> 29:27.399
Well, I knew...
I knew then that, uh...

29:27.433 --> 29:29.335
I was gonna
get through it.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.539
Boston lost that series.

29:33.572 --> 29:37.776
Yes, but I made it home.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.882
We'll find the son
of a bitch, sir.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.497
Mr. brenner.

30:02.568 --> 30:05.371
I understand you have
special arrest powers.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.438
Yes, sir.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.307
But I'm going to ask

30:08.340 --> 30:10.242
before you
arrest anyone,

30:10.276 --> 30:11.377
you notify me.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.480
Why is that, sir?

30:14.513 --> 30:16.082
We don't like
our personnel

30:16.115 --> 30:18.250
being arrested
by outside people

30:18.284 --> 30:19.986
without
our knowing about it.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.389
There are 3 ways
of doing things...

30:23.422 --> 30:26.993
The right way,
the wrong way,

30:27.026 --> 30:27.894
and the army way.

30:27.927 --> 30:31.597
See that in doing it
your way, Mr. brenner,

30:31.630 --> 30:34.833
you don't forget
about the army way.

30:58.524 --> 31:01.627
Our job here at psy ops
is to panic the enemy,

31:01.660 --> 31:03.662
to blunt
his will to fight.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.165
A psy operator must know
the customs and habits

31:06.198 --> 31:07.366
of the enemy,

31:07.399 --> 31:10.369
the current dissensions,
anxieties, and fears

31:10.402 --> 31:11.971
to determine
vulnerability.

31:12.004 --> 31:15.207
To engage the enemy,
you must know the enemy

31:15.241 --> 31:16.208
inside out.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.244
You must fill him
with fear,

31:18.277 --> 31:21.080
and not just fear of dying.

31:21.113 --> 31:24.516
Fear of grotesque wounds
is much more terrifying.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.386
Ugh.
Grotesque wounds.

31:27.419 --> 31:30.889
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.027
May I help you?

31:36.328 --> 31:38.998
Might I ask what you're doing
in captain Campbell's office?

31:39.031 --> 31:40.699
That depends
on who you are.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.635
So comfortably ensconced
in her office, I might add.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.538
Colonel Robert Moore.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.715
Captain Campbell's
commanding officer

31:47.739 --> 31:49.575
here at psy ops.
And you are?

31:49.608 --> 31:53.112
We're from the criminal
investigation division.

31:53.145 --> 31:56.182
Warrant officers sunhill
and brenner.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.585
And you're investigating?

31:59.618 --> 32:02.054
The murder
of captain Campbell.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.692
And now that
we know who you are,

32:06.725 --> 32:09.728
we'll need to
speak to you, colonel.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.363
Of course.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.599
I just have, uh...

32:13.632 --> 32:17.003
I have a meeting.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.571
Something tells me
we could file colonel Moore

32:19.605 --> 32:21.940
under "last to know."

32:25.411 --> 32:26.578
Are you married?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.314
None of your business.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.216
Right.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.357
Sunhill: Well,
she wasn't a hypochondriac.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.160
She didn't dye her hair,
she didn't have oily skin,

32:41.193 --> 32:43.595
and she keeps her method
of birth control

32:43.629 --> 32:45.064
somewhere else.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.633
Or perhaps she required
her men to wear condoms.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.702
Maybe you've heard that
condoms are in fashion again

32:50.736 --> 32:52.738
because of disease.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.606
Nowadays
you have to boil people

32:54.640 --> 32:56.408
before you can
sleep with them.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.210
Care for a bath?

33:01.380 --> 33:03.615
Oh, my.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.751
This was one
squared-away soldier.

33:05.784 --> 33:08.720
Equally prepared
for a military ball

33:08.754 --> 33:11.623
or the next war
in the jungle.

33:17.363 --> 33:18.497
Moore on machine:
Liz, hi.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.099
Uh, pick up.
It's Robert.

33:20.132 --> 33:24.403
I haven't heard from you,
so, ahem, call me, please.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.239
Robert.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.508
Surprise, surprise.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.192
Sunhill: Paul?

33:46.225 --> 33:48.160
Move aside.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.096
Man with a gun.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.730
Sunhill:
There's nothing here.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.632
Let's go.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.725
There's a false wall.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.750
Uhh. Ha.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.886
This is it.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.693
Oh, my god.

35:42.808 --> 35:46.312
Brenner:
What have we got here?

35:46.345 --> 35:50.349
10 bucks says these are not
the lost honeymooners episodes.

36:17.576 --> 36:20.178
Get down!

36:25.651 --> 36:27.219
What do you think
you're doing?

36:27.253 --> 36:28.720
Stop it!

36:39.030 --> 36:40.332
Aah!

36:44.436 --> 36:48.740
Well, how she died
does appear to be linked

36:48.774 --> 36:50.476
to how she lived.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.748
All right.
What we need to do here

36:56.782 --> 36:57.983
is to hold on
to these tapes

36:58.016 --> 36:59.385
till we need them.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.552
We empty the house,

37:00.586 --> 37:02.554
send this all
to the cid lab,

37:02.588 --> 37:03.855
padlock the house,

37:03.889 --> 37:06.858
and we take our chances
with the local police staff.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.560
Is this Paul brenner
speaking?

37:08.594 --> 37:09.795
This is Paul brenner,

37:09.828 --> 37:11.530
the career army officer
speaking,

37:11.563 --> 37:12.798
not the cop.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.008
The evidence of her killer
might be on that tape.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.000
I don't have to
tell you that.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.735
There's enough
evidence here

37:16.768 --> 37:17.879
to ruin the lives
of everyone involved,

37:17.903 --> 37:20.238
including the general.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.041
Now, look,
we take the tapes,

37:23.074 --> 37:24.810
we use them
when we need them,

37:24.843 --> 37:28.347
let cid do their job,

37:28.380 --> 37:31.317
and keep all nonmilitary
out of this, ok?

37:34.720 --> 37:36.488
Ok.

37:36.522 --> 37:37.889
Good.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.925
I'll call Kent.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.493
All right. Here.

37:41.527 --> 37:42.594
It's hot.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.262
Thanks.

38:03.849 --> 38:04.916
The phone's down.

38:04.950 --> 38:08.420
I'm gonna go use
the cell in the car.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.434
Aah!

38:46.925 --> 38:48.326
Sunhill: Paul?

38:49.461 --> 38:51.329
Paul!

38:59.871 --> 39:01.840
Did you make out
a face?

39:01.873 --> 39:03.074
Yeah.

39:03.108 --> 39:06.445
It was flat, steel,
and used to clear snow.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.780
Come on.

39:08.814 --> 39:09.857
So did you ever
marry that guy

39:09.881 --> 39:11.450
you were seeing
on the side?

39:11.483 --> 39:14.152
Paul, this isn't exactly
the time to be...

39:14.185 --> 39:15.020
Humor me.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.121
I'm near concussed.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.023
Now, did you
or did you not

39:18.056 --> 39:19.858
marry the guy you were
seeing on the side?

39:19.891 --> 39:22.794
I was engaged to that guy.
I was seeing you on the side.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.362
Fine.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.998
So how is the boy major?

39:27.032 --> 39:28.476
He seemed a little annoyed
the last time

39:28.500 --> 39:31.903
I saw him in Brussels
with a pistol in his hand.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.042
Make a hole!

39:42.781 --> 39:44.382
Identification,
please.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.953
Are you working on
the murder case, ma'am?

39:47.986 --> 39:50.622
Yes, I am.
And this is my father.

39:50.656 --> 39:51.957
Please proceed.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.645
What happened to you?

40:13.679 --> 40:14.913
Went off post...

40:14.946 --> 40:16.047
Without
civilian authority.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.916
And my head paid
the price for it.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.084
There you go.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.218
Per your request.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.087
Is this
her entire record file?

40:22.120 --> 40:23.922
That's it.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.524
Come up
with anything yet?

40:25.557 --> 40:27.793
No. Just a preliminary
list of suspects.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.461
Already? Who?

40:29.495 --> 40:30.929
Everyone.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.098
Well, you ought to
start getting alibis.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.066
Ok, how about you?

40:35.100 --> 40:37.068
Home in bed
when the tower called.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.236
Aha!
Oh, fuck off, Paul.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.871
Where were you
last night?

40:39.905 --> 40:41.082
I was busy killing
someone else.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.674
I didn't have time
to kill 2 people.

40:42.708 --> 40:43.975
Likely story.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.110
And you?

40:45.143 --> 40:48.113
Uh, I went to the v.O.Q.
At 1900 hours.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.115
I worked on my neely
case report

40:50.148 --> 40:51.116
till about midnight,

40:51.149 --> 40:53.619
and then I went home.

40:53.652 --> 40:54.820
No witnesses.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.087
Pathetic,
the both of you.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.557
Oh, you should have
invited me up to your room,

40:58.590 --> 41:00.091
and we would have had
an alibi.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.194
I would rather be
a murder suspect.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.095
Ohh.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.997
Don't encourage her.

41:06.031 --> 41:07.666
By the way,
Cal seiver's here.

41:07.699 --> 41:08.634
Oh, good.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.636
Now, look, Cal is the best
forensic man around,

41:10.669 --> 41:11.979
but don't say anything
about his hair.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.043
What's wrong
with his hair?

41:13.071 --> 41:14.706
He doesn't have any.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.107
Hey, Cal!

41:16.141 --> 41:19.110
Shouldn't you be
wearing a hat?

41:19.144 --> 41:20.879
What the hell
happened to you?

41:20.912 --> 41:24.115
Well, you know, not everybody
loves me as much as you do, Cal.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.083
This is Sarah sunhill.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.251
Hello.
How are you?

41:26.284 --> 41:28.053
The entire world walked
around this body.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.556
Paul, there's gotta be
50 boot prints here.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.157
Have you found
the clothes yet?

41:32.190 --> 41:34.259
Not yet. I figured
you'd want some space,

41:34.292 --> 41:35.994
so I commandeered
an empty hangar.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.129
Good man.
Have everything taken there.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.065
Is there any trace
of semen on the victim?

41:40.098 --> 41:42.133
I ran an ultraviolet.
I can't find any.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.835
The coroner
will run vaginal,

41:43.869 --> 41:45.103
oral, and anal swabs,

41:45.136 --> 41:46.872
and we'll know about
that in due course.

41:46.905 --> 41:49.074
It is a strange rape.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.141
Yeah.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.777
Why do you say that?

41:51.810 --> 41:54.145
Well, our guy wasn't
just a rapist. Excuse me.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.881
He was
a premeditated killer.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.248
Brenner: Go ahead.

41:57.282 --> 42:00.786
He set up a rape kit,
tent pegs, and ropes,

42:00.819 --> 42:01.820
and he used it.

42:01.853 --> 42:02.921
Yeah.

42:02.954 --> 42:06.157
Well, there are no signs
of a struggle.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.593
She was a strong woman.

42:07.626 --> 42:08.760
I couldn't find
a bit of dirt

42:08.794 --> 42:10.629
under her fingernails.

42:10.662 --> 42:11.963
And how did he
hold a gun on her

42:11.997 --> 42:13.198
and manage to
tie the ropes?

42:13.231 --> 42:16.635
Unless it was
more than one person.

42:16.668 --> 42:18.904
What are those marks
on her cheeks?

42:18.937 --> 42:22.040
Those were tears, Paul.

42:23.942 --> 42:25.310
The panties
under the rope

42:25.343 --> 42:27.746
as if to protect
her neck from a burn.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.180
I mean, what's
a little rope burn

42:29.214 --> 42:30.916
if you're going
to kill somebody?

42:30.949 --> 42:33.118
Sunhill's good.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.220
Oh, yeah.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.188
Sunhill has spoken.

43:41.052 --> 43:44.189
Brenner: Could you see
the body from here, private?

43:44.222 --> 43:46.792
No. But I saw
the headlights.

43:46.825 --> 43:48.259
The headlights?

43:48.293 --> 43:50.361
I... I hated
that it was her.

43:50.395 --> 43:52.130
Sunhill:
You knew her, then?

43:52.163 --> 43:54.399
No. But, um...

43:55.333 --> 43:58.269
Captain Campbell
was, uh...

43:58.303 --> 44:01.406
She was real good
to female enlisted.

44:01.439 --> 44:02.373
How so?

44:02.407 --> 44:06.778
She, uh, organized
meetings for us, and, uh...

44:08.313 --> 44:10.148
See, there's a lot
of shit...

44:10.181 --> 44:14.285
I mean, there's a lot of stuff
if you're a woman in the army

44:14.319 --> 44:17.422
to... that you got to
put up with, and, uh...

44:17.455 --> 44:20.025
A lot of people don't like
that we're here.

44:20.058 --> 44:25.163
But captain Campbell,
she encouraged us, and, uh...

44:25.196 --> 44:26.998
I'm sorry!

44:27.032 --> 44:28.099
You're allowed
to cry.

44:28.133 --> 44:29.476
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.069
Now, what about
the headlights?

44:31.102 --> 44:32.370
Now, you didn't...

44:32.403 --> 44:33.480
Didn't you think
it was someone coming home

44:33.504 --> 44:36.241
or using the latrine
or something?

44:36.274 --> 44:37.442
Sometimes people
go out there

44:37.475 --> 44:41.046
when the nights are nice
to fuck.

44:41.079 --> 44:43.882
Pardon my French.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.118
But that's what
i thought...

44:47.152 --> 44:48.419
The first time.

44:48.453 --> 44:49.888
Both: The first time?

44:49.921 --> 44:53.458
The first time I saw
the headlights was at 0300.

44:53.491 --> 44:57.963
They went away,
and they came back at 0330.

44:57.996 --> 45:02.000
Then they went away again,
then they came back at 0400.

45:04.836 --> 45:07.038
Ok. Thank you.

45:12.243 --> 45:14.379
Brenner:
What's going on, bill?

45:14.412 --> 45:16.347
What are you doing here,
yardley?

45:16.381 --> 45:19.084
You got a shitload
of explaining to do, son.

45:19.117 --> 45:21.386
May I ask what your
official business is here?

45:21.419 --> 45:24.990
My official business
here, son,

45:25.023 --> 45:27.392
is to ask you
why there's a bunch of mps

45:27.425 --> 45:30.095
haulin' furniture
out of an off-post residence

45:30.128 --> 45:31.368
that belongs
to a murder victim.

45:31.396 --> 45:34.365
The family of the deceased,
chief yardley,

45:34.399 --> 45:36.367
asked me to take charge
of those items

45:36.401 --> 45:38.904
and transport them here.

45:38.937 --> 45:40.414
Sunhill, remind me
to call general Campbell

45:40.438 --> 45:42.507
and suggest that I take
charge of those items

45:42.540 --> 45:43.909
and transport them here.

45:43.942 --> 45:44.910
You got it.

45:44.943 --> 45:46.311
Jesus, Paul.

45:46.344 --> 45:47.554
You know what you need,
chief yardley,

45:47.578 --> 45:48.980
if you don't mind my saying,

45:49.014 --> 45:51.116
is a pair of them
mirrored sunglasses,

45:51.149 --> 45:52.250
for you
and the little one.

45:52.283 --> 45:54.953
That'd really
complete the picture.

46:01.192 --> 46:03.161
So...

46:03.194 --> 46:04.863
Did you ever marry,
uh...

46:04.896 --> 46:07.165
Major what's-his-name
with the gun?

46:07.198 --> 46:09.067
Yes, I did.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.435
Oh...

46:10.468 --> 46:11.536
Congratulations.

46:11.569 --> 46:13.504
I'm extremely happy
for you, Sarah.

46:13.538 --> 46:14.539
And I wish you both

46:14.572 --> 46:16.174
the best that life
has to offer.

46:16.207 --> 46:18.176
I filed for a divorce.

46:18.209 --> 46:19.277
Good.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.989
Thank you.

46:32.190 --> 46:34.559
Sunhill:
2 club sodas, please.

46:41.066 --> 46:43.434
Elby: Let's go, boys.

46:43.468 --> 46:45.436
Come on,
i got no place to go!

46:45.470 --> 46:47.038
You should
see her record.

46:47.072 --> 46:48.439
Brenner: And there's
your boyfriend

46:48.473 --> 46:50.541
from the
general's house.

46:50.575 --> 46:52.043
Valedictorian
in high school,

46:52.077 --> 46:52.944
super athlete.

46:52.978 --> 46:55.480
She picked west point,
like her daddy did.

46:55.513 --> 46:57.015
Brenner:
Now there's a guy

46:57.048 --> 46:59.184
who knows how
to have a good time.

46:59.217 --> 47:02.153
Paul, look at me.

47:02.187 --> 47:03.454
Ahem.

47:03.488 --> 47:05.456
I think something
happened to her there.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.458
Elisabeth Campbell
was tops in her class,

47:07.492 --> 47:09.460
and she went all to shit
her sophomore year.

47:09.494 --> 47:11.496
She barely
got through school.

47:11.529 --> 47:13.031
Senior year was better,

47:13.064 --> 47:15.166
and she managed to graduate
and get a degree, but...

47:15.200 --> 47:17.202
She was never
quite the same.

47:17.235 --> 47:18.503
Hmm.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.308
I thought you hated
places like this.

47:23.341 --> 47:24.475
I do.

47:24.509 --> 47:28.179
However, the murderer
may be in this room,

47:28.213 --> 47:30.515
sitting all smug
and shiny...

47:30.548 --> 47:32.283
Until we walked in.

47:32.317 --> 47:34.185
And now maybe
he's a little less smug

47:34.219 --> 47:36.087
and a little less shiny.

47:36.121 --> 47:38.223
And that's pretty cool,

47:38.256 --> 47:39.490
don't you think?

47:42.393 --> 47:44.195
What about you?

47:44.229 --> 47:45.496
Oh, I hope Brussels

47:45.530 --> 47:47.198
wasn't the last time
you had a woman.

47:47.232 --> 47:48.533
Oh, brother.
Here we go.

47:48.566 --> 47:50.501
You know, I always
thought that you chose

47:50.535 --> 47:52.437
to avoid a confrontation
with my fiancé

47:52.470 --> 47:54.239
like I wasn't worth
the trouble.

47:54.272 --> 47:55.606
The man threatened
to kill me.

47:55.640 --> 47:56.674
I chose discretion.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.443
It's the better part
of valor.

47:58.476 --> 48:00.245
Weren't you decorated
for valor?

48:00.278 --> 48:01.512
Oh, please!

48:01.546 --> 48:05.216
Sometimes you just gotta
fight for what you want.

48:05.250 --> 48:07.218
That's if you want it.

48:07.252 --> 48:10.255
I received a bronze star
for valor, miss sunhill,

48:10.288 --> 48:11.522
for charging up a hill

48:11.556 --> 48:13.925
that I didn't particularly
need or want.

48:13.959 --> 48:14.993
And besides,

48:15.026 --> 48:16.537
I don't remember getting
any encouragement from you.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.529
Well, maybe I wanted you
not to accept

48:18.563 --> 48:19.998
my decision
to break it off.

48:20.031 --> 48:21.575
Maybe I wanted you to
take me away from him.

48:21.599 --> 48:23.234
So we're talking
about telepathy here,

48:23.268 --> 48:24.535
not communica...

48:24.569 --> 48:26.413
You know, let's just talk
about this next week, ok?

48:26.437 --> 48:28.406
Fine.
Just one more thing.

48:28.439 --> 48:29.707
Is this next week
already?

48:29.740 --> 48:32.010
You are such a goddamn
sharp detective,

48:32.043 --> 48:33.044
aren't you?

48:33.078 --> 48:34.645
But you sure
can't read yourself,

48:34.679 --> 48:36.914
and you sure as hell don't
know a thing about women.

48:39.584 --> 48:41.352
You know...

48:41.386 --> 48:43.921
You're very cute
when I'm mad at you.

48:45.123 --> 48:46.357
However...

48:46.391 --> 48:48.426
If you'll excuse me,

48:48.459 --> 48:50.695
I'll take my anger out
on someone else.

49:07.545 --> 49:09.114
Ridiculous behavior
earlier.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.581
I'm sorry.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.184
Well, we didn't exactly
let you see it coming.

49:13.218 --> 49:15.753
Liz was more or less
my protége.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.522
At least,
i like to think she was.

49:17.555 --> 49:18.523
We were...

49:18.556 --> 49:21.592
Very close.

49:21.626 --> 49:23.061
Please sit down.

49:23.094 --> 49:25.063
Did you work together
on a daily basis?

49:25.096 --> 49:26.597
Absolutely.

49:26.631 --> 49:29.334
Did you, uh...

49:29.367 --> 49:32.470
Play together?

49:32.503 --> 49:35.540
What a truly
excellent question.

49:35.573 --> 49:36.774
You see,
here at psy ops,

49:36.807 --> 49:38.976
that's one of the things
that we teach...

49:39.810 --> 49:41.779
Threatening quietly.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.548
Think of the echoes

49:43.581 --> 49:45.150
inherent in
those 4 simple words.

49:45.183 --> 49:46.551
"Did you...

49:46.584 --> 49:48.553
Play together?"

49:48.586 --> 49:51.489
Did you go out with her?

49:51.522 --> 49:52.623
Did you fuck her?

49:52.657 --> 49:54.625
Did you love her?
If you did...

49:54.659 --> 49:57.628
Did you love her so much
that you murdered her?

49:57.662 --> 49:59.730
I meant did you play golf
or tennis

49:59.764 --> 50:01.632
or checkers or something?

50:01.666 --> 50:03.368
No, you didn't.

50:03.401 --> 50:05.636
No, I didn't.

50:05.670 --> 50:08.539
So now, we both know
we're smart guys.

50:08.573 --> 50:10.641
Do you think
I'm involved in this?

50:10.675 --> 50:12.410
One way or another,
yes, I do.

50:12.443 --> 50:13.544
Then wouldn't it
behoove me

50:13.578 --> 50:14.755
to retain the services
of an attorney?

50:14.779 --> 50:15.746
I know a good one.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.548
2 problems there.

50:17.582 --> 50:20.051
First, the obvious.
There are no good ones.

50:20.085 --> 50:21.752
Second...

50:21.786 --> 50:23.454
You're not a civilian,
colonel.

50:23.488 --> 50:24.522
You're in the army.

50:24.555 --> 50:25.799
You have no rights
to an attorney.

50:25.823 --> 50:28.526
You have no right
to remain silent.

50:28.559 --> 50:30.804
And if you don't cooperate,
i may have to put you in jail,

50:30.828 --> 50:32.463
and that would make me
feel bad.

50:32.497 --> 50:34.165
You see what
you're doing here?

50:34.199 --> 50:35.400
Hmm...

50:35.433 --> 50:36.701
Looking for answers?

50:36.734 --> 50:38.736
Of course that. But how?

50:40.538 --> 50:41.672
How?

50:41.706 --> 50:43.574
You're trying
to make me like you.

50:43.608 --> 50:45.576
And you know what?

50:45.610 --> 50:47.812
It's working. I do.

50:47.845 --> 50:50.848
But now do you see
what I'm trying to do?

50:50.881 --> 50:53.351
I'm trying to make you
like me, too.

50:54.719 --> 50:56.821
Do you like me yet?

50:56.854 --> 50:58.689
Why did you strangle her?

50:58.723 --> 51:01.359
Wrong. Sorry. Not
up to your standards.

51:04.462 --> 51:06.431
Did you go to college?

51:06.464 --> 51:08.199
What do you think?

51:11.469 --> 51:13.571
I think you did not.

51:13.604 --> 51:16.174
Why, did I make a mistake
in grammar?

51:17.208 --> 51:18.576
Of course not.

51:18.609 --> 51:19.810
And even if you were to,

51:19.844 --> 51:21.812
I wouldn't be rude
enough to point it out.

51:21.846 --> 51:25.082
No, you have this chip
on your shoulder.

51:26.351 --> 51:27.718
Big one.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.592
Makes you good at your
job, though, doesn't it?

51:29.620 --> 51:30.821
I would imagine.

51:30.855 --> 51:32.590
Holds you in good stead

51:32.623 --> 51:34.168
when you see those
commissioned officers,

51:34.192 --> 51:35.726
those spit-and-Polish
college types

51:35.760 --> 51:37.195
just waiting for you.

51:37.228 --> 51:39.197
You're the scoundrel
in the rumpled suit

51:39.230 --> 51:40.831
with a healthy disdain
for the rules,

51:40.865 --> 51:42.733
just waiting
to bring them down.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.135
Am I right?

51:44.169 --> 51:45.035
Nah. No.

51:45.069 --> 51:46.747
I'm just here to kick ass,
sleep till noon.

51:46.771 --> 51:49.607
And you cover
your inadequacies

51:49.640 --> 51:50.841
with a condescension

51:50.875 --> 51:53.611
for the more robust
individuals around you.

51:53.644 --> 51:54.745
How am I doing?

51:54.779 --> 51:57.448
Not bad. Robust, even.

51:57.482 --> 51:58.783
When did...

51:58.816 --> 52:00.751
The event transpire?

52:00.785 --> 52:02.487
0400, we think.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.521
Mmm. See that?

52:03.554 --> 52:04.765
My quick segue
back to the case?

52:04.789 --> 52:06.357
Subtle as a chain saw.

52:06.391 --> 52:07.758
And where were you?

52:07.792 --> 52:08.926
Snug in bed.

52:08.959 --> 52:09.760
Witnesses?

52:09.794 --> 52:12.230
A wife, girlfriend,
roommate, hooker?

52:12.263 --> 52:13.564
I'm divorced.

52:13.598 --> 52:15.800
I'm between girlfriends,
i live alone,

52:15.833 --> 52:18.369
and I do not
use hookers.

52:18.403 --> 52:19.937
I actually have...

52:19.970 --> 52:22.773
Absolutely no alibi
whatsoever.

52:22.807 --> 52:24.942
Does that make me
a killer?

52:24.975 --> 52:26.477
No.

52:26.511 --> 52:28.713
Makes you lonely
and unpopular.

52:28.746 --> 52:29.814
Mmm. Very good.

52:29.847 --> 52:31.949
Condescending and..

52:31.982 --> 52:32.817
Clever.

52:32.850 --> 52:36.187
No. Thank you.

52:36.221 --> 52:37.555
Ok, so...

52:37.588 --> 52:38.789
You called her machine.

52:38.823 --> 52:40.725
You're very concerned.

52:40.758 --> 52:42.327
What was this,
jealousy, perhaps?

52:42.360 --> 52:43.861
Perhaps not.

52:46.764 --> 52:47.965
Liz was my friend.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.501
I hadn't heard from her
in a couple of days.

52:50.535 --> 52:51.536
Ahem.

52:51.569 --> 52:52.937
Ok, so as her friend,

52:52.970 --> 52:55.840
did you know anyone
that she was involved with?

52:55.873 --> 52:57.508
You mean sexually.

52:57.542 --> 52:58.943
Yes, sexually.

52:58.976 --> 53:00.811
She was seeing someone.

53:00.845 --> 53:02.547
Civilian.

53:02.580 --> 53:04.315
A fella named yardley.

53:05.450 --> 53:07.184
Police chief yardley?

53:08.653 --> 53:09.954
No.

53:09.987 --> 53:11.589
Nooo.

53:11.622 --> 53:12.823
Ah. Ok.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.992
The son. His deputy.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.761
Uh, Wes.

53:16.794 --> 53:18.996
Yes, Wes.
Yes, ok.

53:19.029 --> 53:20.831
Uh, they'd been seeing
each other off and on,

53:20.865 --> 53:22.833
if you'll pardon the pun,
for a few months.

53:22.867 --> 53:25.303
Ok, so look, it's obvious
you were very close to her.

53:25.336 --> 53:27.838
I'm just trying to find out
what "very" means.

53:27.872 --> 53:31.008
It means...

53:31.041 --> 53:32.877
Very.

53:33.744 --> 53:35.446
I was Liz's mentor.

53:36.581 --> 53:39.317
There was a trust...

53:39.350 --> 53:40.585
She was, yes,

53:40.618 --> 53:41.586
a passionate
young woman,

53:41.619 --> 53:42.853
as well
she should have been,

53:42.887 --> 53:47.325
but had I ever taken
advantage of that...

53:48.626 --> 53:50.861
I would've
lost the trust.

53:50.895 --> 53:53.864
So did I kill her?
Of course not.

53:53.898 --> 53:57.468
Did I love her?

53:57.502 --> 53:59.236
I loved her very much.

54:02.707 --> 54:04.609
Make of that
what you will.

54:08.679 --> 54:11.782
Major Briggs,
please report to lab one.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.363
This is what made him
famous, isn't it?

54:25.396 --> 54:27.432
Oh, yeah, yeah.

54:27.465 --> 54:29.834
That's the ledgeworth
city riots.

54:29.867 --> 54:31.902
The whole city
was in chaos.

54:31.936 --> 54:33.338
The general quelled it.

54:33.371 --> 54:35.906
And then he brought in
unarmed troops

54:35.940 --> 54:37.908
and his little daughter

54:37.942 --> 54:39.510
just to prove
it was safe.

54:39.544 --> 54:41.812
She looks terrified.

54:48.486 --> 54:50.455
Excellent work.

54:50.488 --> 54:52.923
I'm going to head down
to the morgue.

54:52.957 --> 54:54.725
The report should be in.
You want to come?

54:54.759 --> 54:56.461
Yeah,
we'll meet you there.

54:56.494 --> 54:58.062
I gotta talk to Cal.
Cal!

54:58.095 --> 54:59.530
Coming.

54:59.564 --> 55:00.731
So how's Moore?

55:01.966 --> 55:03.534
Complicated.

55:03.568 --> 55:04.635
Yeah?

55:04.669 --> 55:05.836
Cal.

55:05.870 --> 55:07.705
We got the dog tag latents
back from the lab.

55:07.738 --> 55:08.939
Partial prints

55:08.973 --> 55:10.813
belong to somebody other
than captain Campbell.

55:10.841 --> 55:11.809
Who's that?

55:11.842 --> 55:14.111
Robert Moore.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.313
Hello.

55:27.492 --> 55:29.994
Smells good.

55:34.932 --> 55:36.434
What are
you doing here?

55:36.467 --> 55:38.769
I'm here to ask you
a question, Bobby.

55:38.803 --> 55:39.970
Huh.

55:40.004 --> 55:42.607
And the question is?

55:44.174 --> 55:46.076
Why...

55:46.110 --> 55:47.978
Were you so stupid...

55:48.012 --> 55:50.881
As to leave your
fingerprints everywhere?

55:52.016 --> 55:53.984
My answer, you panicked.

55:54.018 --> 55:55.853
I teach panic, remember?

55:55.886 --> 55:57.021
And?

55:57.054 --> 55:58.131
Well, obviously,
i didn't plan for things

55:58.155 --> 55:59.990
to work out this way.

56:00.024 --> 56:00.991
Define "things."

56:01.025 --> 56:03.994
Look, Paul...

56:04.028 --> 56:05.630
May I call you Paul?

56:05.663 --> 56:06.597
I so enjoyed it

56:06.631 --> 56:08.599
when you took the Liberty
of calling me Bobby.

56:08.633 --> 56:11.769
We are, I assume, still trying
to outsmart each other.

56:11.802 --> 56:13.471
Obviously, Paul...

56:13.504 --> 56:15.906
I cannot tell a lie
and say...

56:15.940 --> 56:17.775
I know nothing
about all of this.

56:17.808 --> 56:19.009
Ahh.

56:20.778 --> 56:22.913
I also, sadly...

56:22.947 --> 56:24.615
Cannot tell the truth.

56:24.649 --> 56:27.552
'Cause you think silence
will save your ass.

56:27.585 --> 56:29.954
My ass, as you
so delicately put it,

56:29.987 --> 56:32.790
is already in a sling,
is it not?

56:32.823 --> 56:35.593
You mean the sex tapes.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.835
You're good.

56:44.869 --> 56:48.038
Hmm. You're good.

56:48.072 --> 56:49.507
Great question.

56:49.540 --> 56:51.084
Almost any answer
incriminates me, doesn't it?

56:51.108 --> 56:53.043
Yep. That's
why I like it.

56:53.077 --> 56:54.912
Yeah, so let's cut
the bullshit.

56:54.945 --> 56:56.046
Let's do that.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.848
We both know
I'm pretty much destroyed,

56:57.882 --> 56:58.983
don't we?

56:59.016 --> 57:01.051
Can you think of
any compelling reason

57:01.085 --> 57:04.088
why Elisabeth should be
destroyed along with me?

57:05.623 --> 57:06.757
Can you?

57:06.791 --> 57:09.426
I can't... Paul.

57:12.096 --> 57:15.800
I watched the two of you...

57:15.833 --> 57:17.802
On one of her tapes.

57:20.905 --> 57:22.072
I don't think so.

57:22.106 --> 57:24.008
You know, bluffing is
the last desperate act

57:24.041 --> 57:26.944
of the weak, Paul.

57:26.977 --> 57:29.079
I'll not help you
ruin that girl.

57:29.113 --> 57:30.681
She's suffered enough.

57:30.715 --> 57:32.082
Leave it there.

57:32.116 --> 57:34.519
I'm all you've got.

57:36.053 --> 57:37.087
Wrong again.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.890
Hello, captain.

57:39.924 --> 57:41.225
Hello.

57:41.258 --> 57:43.103
Captain goodson is with
the judge advocate's office.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.229
He's also my lawyer.

57:45.262 --> 57:47.532
Anything you have to say
to colonel Moore...

57:47.565 --> 57:50.234
I'll say
to colonel Moore.

57:50.267 --> 57:52.202
Don't think you can
bully my client.

57:52.236 --> 57:53.838
You know,
I'm done bullying.

57:53.871 --> 57:55.973
You're under arrest,
Bobby. Come here.

57:56.006 --> 57:57.207
Conduct unbecoming
an officer.

57:57.241 --> 57:59.043
Plus article 1-34,

57:59.076 --> 58:01.111
disorderly
and neglect,

58:01.145 --> 58:03.047
accessory after the fact,
conspiracy,

58:03.080 --> 58:04.982
making false statements,
and...

58:05.015 --> 58:07.151
Captain, you are the verge
of article 98,

58:07.184 --> 58:10.054
noncompliance
with procedural rules.

58:13.858 --> 58:15.826
Can I help you, ma'am?

58:15.860 --> 58:17.161
Just taking another look.

58:17.194 --> 58:18.663
Go ahead, ma'am.

58:18.696 --> 58:19.797
Thank you.

58:40.217 --> 58:43.788
Is it possible the bag
holding the victim's clothes

58:43.821 --> 58:46.857
was going to be picked up
by her killer

58:46.891 --> 58:49.159
or by a third party?

58:49.193 --> 58:51.528
Radio: 5-Charlie,
do you copy?

58:54.131 --> 58:56.667
This is 5-Charlie.

59:05.209 --> 59:10.314
Maybe she was here
for a secret rendezvous...

59:10.347 --> 59:11.816
A tryst.

59:12.950 --> 59:16.553
Maybe the rape fantasy
was part of the thrill.

59:17.354 --> 59:19.189
We all know
she had a predilection

59:19.223 --> 59:21.258
for the gamier side of sex.

59:22.693 --> 59:24.995
Is there anything
to the argument

59:25.029 --> 59:26.230
that Elisabeth Campbell
picked

59:26.263 --> 59:27.674
what amounted to
a nearly public place

59:27.698 --> 59:29.934
because it presented
an element of...

59:38.843 --> 59:40.711
Fuck.

59:40.745 --> 59:42.579
Aah!

59:47.818 --> 59:49.954
Hold that bitch down.
Let me get in there.

59:51.722 --> 59:53.090
This is the army.

59:53.123 --> 59:54.358
So you tell brenner,

59:54.391 --> 59:56.961
you don't shit
on your brothers.

59:58.295 --> 01:00:01.699
Rape investigator, huh?

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:03.868
Want to know
what it feels like? Huh?

01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:08.038
Maybe it'll make you better
at your job, huh?

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:10.607
Huh? Huh?

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:33.931
Number 5.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.169
Got yourself a colonel
this time, huh?

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:42.006
Shut up, elkins.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:45.375
Aah.

01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:47.053
You were acting as her shrink,
were you not?

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:49.213
Were you not?!

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:52.983
The Elisabeth I met
was bright and shiny.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:54.919
The woman on the tape
is a different lady...

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:57.087
And there's a direct
connection, isn't there?

01:00:57.121 --> 01:01:00.290
Isn't there?

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:03.027
Are you going to pull
my fingernails out now?

01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:23.313
What happened sophomore year
at the point?

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:36.060
You're a murderer
or an accessory to murder.

01:01:36.093 --> 01:01:38.428
Either way, you're gonna
get burned at the stake.

01:01:38.462 --> 01:01:40.697
Nobody's gonna bail you out!

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:44.368
Moore: It was awful.

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:52.009
It was awful. Go ahead.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:58.148
What, she violated a code?
She cheated? She lied? What?

01:01:58.182 --> 01:01:59.516
Worse.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.517
Drugs.

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:03.153
Worse.

01:02:03.187 --> 01:02:04.488
Rape.

01:02:13.798 --> 01:02:14.531
Worse.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:17.367
What's worse than rape?

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.370
When you find that out...

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:23.073
Then you'll know everything,
won't you?

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:52.136
Tell me what the hell
happened, bill?

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:53.403
Look, I'm sorry, Paul,

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.140
but the mp claims he got
a call to leave his post.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:57.413
I've got no record
of that call.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.944
Probably a dead end,
but I'm gonna take it further.

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:03.213
I'm pulling up.
Talk to me later.

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:04.581
She's fine,
Paul.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.415
I'm ok.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.784
Who did it?

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:21.832
Stupid play, elby.

01:03:21.866 --> 01:03:23.200
Rookie move.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.045
Should remember to take off
all identifying jewelry

01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:26.270
before an attack.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.374
I told you I was in
the "o" club all night.

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:33.143
She's crazy,
and you're crazy.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:35.379
Aah! You burnt me.

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:36.914
Sorry.

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:37.882
What the fuck?!

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:40.384
You just can't get good
styrofoam these days.

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:41.986
Ok, let's change
the subject.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:44.955
What can you tell me about
captain Elisabeth Campbell?

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.158
What about her?

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:50.427
She was raped
and killed.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.628
You know what rape
usually is?

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:55.099
It's a woman who changes
her mind afterward.

01:03:57.201 --> 01:03:58.468
Would you classify

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:00.470
your relationship
with Elisabeth Campbell

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.172
as an intimate one?

01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:04.341
You mean
was I fucking her?

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:05.642
Yeah, that is what I mean.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.644
Yeah.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:08.612
I was.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:10.314
But that was all
i took it for.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:11.481
Just some
sport fucking.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.183
I didn't think she'd
run off and tell him.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:14.484
Tell who?

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:16.586
The general. The bitch
told the general.

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.421
Why?

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:18.422
Because
she's a freak,

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:19.623
and that's
what freaks do!

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:21.625
What about the general
and captain Campbell?

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:23.293
Were they close? No.

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:24.361
Why not?

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:25.930
I don't know.
You like your dad?

01:04:25.963 --> 01:04:28.098
My dad was a drunk,
a gambler, and a womanizer.

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:29.499
I worshipped him.

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:32.669
Yeah, well, I think
I've said enough.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:33.938
Aah.

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:34.838
You cooperate,

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:37.174
and maybe we'll keep it
out of the report.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:42.379
You guys don't get it.
With Elisabeth gone,

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:43.556
the general has got
a clear field

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.549
to settle some scores.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:49.519
And I'll be given

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:51.688
the opportunity
to resign.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.991
Maybe I can save
my marriage,

01:04:54.024 --> 01:04:54.992
maybe I can't.

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:56.360
Oh, great.
There's a Mrs. elby.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:57.928
And what does she do,

01:04:57.962 --> 01:04:59.705
aside from wake up in the
middle of the night screaming?

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.332
What do you mean
by settle some scores?

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:03.709
Look, I told you,
i am done talking!

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.170
Hey, we just
got started, elby.

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:08.538
I'm gonna bring you
up on charges

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.307
for the assault
on agent sunhill.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.242
See how you like
40 years of sport fucking

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:14.678
in a military prison.

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.480
Aah!

01:05:16.513 --> 01:05:20.017
Brenner: Ok. Dare me.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:21.385
Go ahead, motherfucker.
Dare me.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:24.454
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:27.091
What do you mean
by settle some scores?

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:29.926
Ok. Ok, ok, ok!

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.268
When she was alive...

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:42.739
He couldn't touch her...

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.242
Without embarrassing
himself.

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.945
He couldn't touch
any of us...

01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:53.317
'Cause he knew
she would spill all.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:54.518
All?

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:55.752
I mean...

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.155
Imagine what
it would look like...

01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.589
The general's
daughter

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.525
banging his entire
male staff.

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:02.759
Entire
male staff?

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.594
Yeah. Yeah.
Everybody.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.463
Well, at least
most of them.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.598
What about
the sheriff's son?

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:12.136
No. That was
just for show.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:13.537
She was pulling

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:14.747
the longest military
train imaginable.

01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:16.206
Right up the chain.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.783
She went through most
of the general's staff,

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.609
plus the staff
of the judge advocate

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:21.745
and people like me
in key positions.

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:23.480
What about colonel Fowler?

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:26.550
Colonel Fowler
once told me...

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:28.785
He knew
all about this

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:31.555
and that I was
part of the problem.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:34.158
I think he meant
that he wasn't.

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:36.660
What do you think
about this, agent sunhill?

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:38.428
I think it's insane.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.629
Not really.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.798
Elisabeth
once told me

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:44.568
she was conducting
a field experiment

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:46.803
in psychological
warfare...

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:50.140
And that the enemy
was daddy.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:56.680
You ok?

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:58.182
Yeah.
I've been better.

01:06:58.215 --> 01:06:59.116
God, Paul.

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:00.517
I know, I know.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:01.827
Most of these officers
are married.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:04.588
It's immediate grounds
for court-martial.

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:06.523
Their lives are over.

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:07.791
But I'll tell you this,

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:09.793
it's a hell of a motive
for murder.

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:11.528
How does it feel
to have our suspect list

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:13.163
multiply exponentially?

01:07:13.197 --> 01:07:14.840
Well, at least we know who
the guys were on the tapes.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.201
Yeah. A bunch of creeps
willing to risk it all

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.668
for a piece of patch.

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:20.670
A piece of patch?

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:21.671
Sorry, darling.

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:23.207
I just get
back on the base,

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.276
and it drudges up all
my old Alpha male behavior.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:27.344
Great.
What's next?

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.579
You gonna do a beer funnel
and light your own farts?

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:30.680
Maybe.

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.182
After we see Moore.

01:07:32.216 --> 01:07:33.350
Oh, I can't wait.

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:37.321
Where is he?

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:40.590
Bill...

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:41.591
Where's Moore?

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:43.427
Uh, he was released.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.428
What?

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:45.562
Restricted
to quarters.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.164
On whose orders?

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:49.599
On mine. Looked like he was
having a damn heart attack.

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:51.177
His lawyer came in,
had a valid complaint.

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:53.603
You can't put an officer
in common lockup.

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:55.539
He's a murder suspect,
bill!

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:56.706
Since when?

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.708
His prints are all over
the goddamn tags.

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:00.753
Well, you never informed us
he was a murder suspect.

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:04.314
He was being held here
for conduct unbecoming,

01:08:04.348 --> 01:08:06.183
not murder.

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:07.717
I had no choice.

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.453
I had no choice.
Bill...

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:47.756
Moore!

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:09.279
Brenner: Moore!

01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:25.161
I'm going in.

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:41.245
Aah.

01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:18.348
Oh, my god.

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:49.889
The organics
on Elisabeth Campbell

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:50.880
came back.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:53.350
There was
no sign of rape.

01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:55.819
What are your
thoughts on this?

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:56.886
Apparent suicide.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.389
Star pattern,
close-contact wound.

01:10:59.423 --> 01:11:01.891
And I don't buy it.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:03.427
Well, I'll do a U.V.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.429
And check his hands
for gunpowder residue.

01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:08.332
I'll let you know if
i find any inconsistencies.

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:13.970
Colonel Kent!

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.272
Yeah?

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:20.444
Were you aware

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:23.913
of Elisabeth Campbell's
extracurricular activities?

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:24.914
How do you mean?

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:27.384
You know what I mean.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.554
Uh...

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:31.855
Uh...

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:33.623
Well...

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:35.625
There were...
There were rumors,

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:36.860
uh, innuendo.

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:40.397
I always took it
as false bravado.

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.632
Soldiers bragging,
that sort of thing,

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:43.800
but, uh...

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:46.302
Well, there was more to it
than that.

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:50.039
Mr. brenner.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.108
As soon as
you're through here,

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.110
we'll convene
at the general's house

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:56.880
to coordinate the release
of the official findings.

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:58.582
What are you
talking about?

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:01.751
Obviously Moore
was overwhelmed with guilt.

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:03.953
We need to close up shop.

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:06.590
Determine what evidence
should be classified,

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:07.857
release a statement

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:09.131
about Moore's guilt
and suicide.

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:11.961
You don't understand,
colonel Fowler.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.863
This is
my investigation,

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:16.099
and it's still open.

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:19.135
Who the hell
do you think you are?

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.704
It's over.

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.406
Over.

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:25.008
You'd better start thinking
about your career, understand?

01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:27.977
And you better start
thinking about yours.

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:30.514
You are running
one lunatic base here.

01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:32.716
You want to mess
with me, colonel?

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:37.654
Let's start
gouging away.

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.362
You've been warned.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:55.138
Move out.

01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:56.473
Soldier:
Yes, sir.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.007
Huh? Huh?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.943
What are you doing here,
yardley?

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:03.012
Shouldn't you be out

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:04.380
nightsticking
the colored folk?

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:08.418
Wait in the car.
I want to talk to him.

01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:09.619
All right.

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:11.020
Your son Wes,

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.957
we gotta speak to him.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.025
Apparently he was involved
with the victim,

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.127
but you neglected
to mention that to us.

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:20.830
Yardley: He was on duty
when it happened.

01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:22.198
His partner
can verify it.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:24.634
And we got tapes
of his radio calls

01:13:24.668 --> 01:13:26.903
all night long.

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:29.405
Just the same,
we'll be in touch.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.408
Good night.

01:13:33.677 --> 01:13:35.411
Asshole.

01:13:43.987 --> 01:13:45.154
What is that?

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:47.891
The gods have smiled on you,
Paul brenner.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:49.225
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.661
Because it's a west point
psychological report

01:13:51.695 --> 01:13:52.428
on Elisabeth Campbell

01:13:52.462 --> 01:13:54.063
and pages
from her medical file...

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:55.765
Pages we were never given.

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:57.501
Well, what does it say?

01:13:57.534 --> 01:14:01.437
It says we're going
to west point.

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:13.449
Yes?

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:16.820
Sunhill: Brenner
and sunhill, sir.

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:18.622
Come in, come in.

01:14:18.655 --> 01:14:20.657
And talk loud.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.992
Terrible thing
for a shrink to lose.

01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:25.094
Can't hear some of my
patients half the time.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.130
Course, considering
some of my patients,

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:29.999
maybe it's a blessing.

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:31.267
Colonel slesinger...

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.137
Would you prefer being
called colonel or doctor?

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.740
I prefer Donald,
and I'm assuming

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:39.108
you didn't fly up from
maccullum to bullshit.

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:41.678
No, sir. It's what
i told you on the phone.

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:44.147
Yes, and I told you
on the phone

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.150
that I can't talk about
captain Campbell.

01:14:47.183 --> 01:14:48.818
Nothing has changed.

01:14:48.852 --> 01:14:50.820
You were her psychiatrist?

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:52.589
And a poor one at that.

01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:54.724
Well, she was, uh...

01:14:54.758 --> 01:14:57.160
At the end of her sophomore year
when she came to see you.

01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:58.662
She must have been about 20.

01:14:58.695 --> 01:15:01.598
She was in
a serious depression.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.600
I take it from
your presence here

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:04.934
Lizzie's in
some trouble again.

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:06.636
Not now.

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:08.504
That's good.

01:15:09.706 --> 01:15:13.176
Well, she's too young
to be dead.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:22.251
Sunhill: She was
strangled, sir.

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:24.721
Mock raped
and then strangled.

01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:40.169
God damn it! God damn it!

01:15:40.203 --> 01:15:43.640
I couldn't help her,
don't you see?

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:44.608
I tried...

01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:48.211
But I could not unlock
her enough to trust me.

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:50.980
But you know what?

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:53.316
I still can't talk
about her.

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:56.552
Sunhill: No, you can't.

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:00.056
But you're angry, yes?

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:02.325
Of course.

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:06.830
Sometimes when I'm angry,
i talk to myself out loud.

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:08.197
Do you ever do that?

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:10.634
Just sort of... rant?

01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:17.941
Yes.

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:20.576
Sometimes.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.380
Well, if you were to rant

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.216
and we happened to be
in the vicinity...

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.918
Free country.

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:31.587
That's my thoughts exactly.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:37.694
She sets a place on fire,
our Lizzie does.

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:40.263
Top woman here.

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:43.166
Pretty as hell.

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:45.969
Outdoes most of the men
in the training runs.

01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:50.774
At the end
of her sophomore year,

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:54.243
there was
a big night exercise.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.612
Must've been
thousands involved.

01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:05.288
Lizzie got separated
from her group.

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:13.629
Found herself with about
a half a dozen men.

01:17:26.843 --> 01:17:29.278
A very dark night.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:32.281
Not only were the men
unknown to her...

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:36.652
But they were also
wearing camouflage.

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:40.389
They raped her
almost to death.

01:17:40.423 --> 01:17:43.760
Raped her all night long.

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:46.195
Taking turns.

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.198
Stripped her...

01:17:49.232 --> 01:17:51.801
Spread-eagled her...

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:01.344
Nailed her to the earth
with tent pegs.

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:04.247
Just had
a whale of a time.

01:18:11.955 --> 01:18:13.990
Threatened to kill her
if she talked.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:19.095
Tied her underwear
around her throat?

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:20.463
Yes.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:14.117
Slesinger:
Lizzie was hospitalized,

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:17.386
treated
for venereal disease,

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.522
treated for pregnancy.

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:44.313
By the time I got to her,
she had gone away inside.

01:19:44.347 --> 01:19:46.215
Never let me get close.

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:48.051
Who were these guys?

01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:50.286
No.
I need a name.

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:53.923
Sorry. Medical ethics.

01:19:57.093 --> 01:19:59.528
I am gonna finish
my work here.

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:02.365
I can't tell you
what to do,

01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:04.968
but if you were to go
back to my office...

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:06.602
Key's under the mat...

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:09.038
And you were to look up
Lizzie's files,

01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:10.173
you might find

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:11.440
an additional
notation there

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:13.209
with a man's name on it.

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:17.546
Might be worth your while
to snoop. Up to you.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.615
Free country and all that.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:26.022
Sorry I couldn't
be of any help.

01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:35.965
Beginning our descent
to fort benning, ma'am.

01:20:52.982 --> 01:20:55.351
Instructor: Pick it up!
Get them outta the water!

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:57.620
Now! Now! Ranger!
Let's go!

01:20:57.653 --> 01:20:59.222
We ain't got all day!

01:20:59.255 --> 01:21:01.490
Female on the floor!

01:21:01.524 --> 01:21:03.426
Soldier:
Female on the floor!

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:06.129
Second soldier:
Female on the floor!

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.535
Captain bransford?

01:21:12.568 --> 01:21:15.504
Whoa. Yeah,
that would be me.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:17.306
What can I do
for you, honey?

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.276
Better yet,
what can you do for me?

01:21:21.577 --> 01:21:23.112
Well, dear,

01:21:23.146 --> 01:21:26.049
you can ask these
other men to excuse us.

01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:28.985
Yeah, that's a cid badge
you're looking at.

01:21:35.591 --> 01:21:37.560
Looks like I picked
the wrong woman to "honey."

01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:39.528
Looks like.

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:41.297
I'm Sarah sunhill,
captain.

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:43.132
I'm a rape investigator
for the cid.

01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:46.936
We need to talk about
Elisabeth Campbell.

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:48.571
Right. Liz.

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:50.974
Liz and I were classmates
together at the point.

01:21:51.007 --> 01:21:53.909
Mm-hmm. Well, I only
have just one question.

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:57.913
How scared are you
right now?

01:21:59.182 --> 01:22:01.550
I'm sorry, miss sunhill.

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:04.253
Is it possible that
you're in the wrong place?

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:06.555
Your heart's racing
a little faster,

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:07.732
there's a little ball
in your throat,

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.959
it's sticky
under the arms.

01:22:09.993 --> 01:22:11.027
Ok, I think
that's enough.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:14.463
You can sit
your ass back down.

01:22:20.303 --> 01:22:22.571
I know you weren't
the leader.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:24.583
If you say so, miss sunhill,
but I really do not know

01:22:24.607 --> 01:22:26.209
what in the world
you're referring to.

01:22:26.242 --> 01:22:28.144
You're too weak
to have started it.

01:22:28.177 --> 01:22:30.279
You're just a guy
who's gotten by

01:22:30.313 --> 01:22:31.580
on his smile
and his charm.

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:33.182
It's a good smile,

01:22:33.216 --> 01:22:35.451
but you could
never lead a rape.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:37.620
Well, that sure is
good to know.

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:41.590
Elisabeth Campbell
was murdered 36 hours ago.

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:45.594
Staked out with tent pegs
and strangled.

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:47.530
So I'm going to ask you
my question again,

01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:49.532
captain bransford.

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:52.701
How scared are you
right now?

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:54.470
I was right here
on the post, lady.

01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:57.073
But you were right there
7 years ago on maneuvers.

01:22:57.106 --> 01:22:58.217
You were right there
for the rape.

01:22:58.241 --> 01:22:59.475
You can't prove shit.

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:02.545
That's not what
Dr. slesinger's records say.

01:23:02.578 --> 01:23:07.716
Yeah, ok. I went
to see slesinger.

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:10.986
And I told him a story
that I had heard.

01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:14.357
That's what his records say,
miss sunhill.

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:15.624
It was just a story.

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:19.662
Somebody else's story,
and that's it, understand?

01:23:33.676 --> 01:23:34.743
What is that?

01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:37.380
What does it look like?

01:23:37.413 --> 01:23:40.149
Well, it looks like
underwear.

01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:43.519
Women's underwear.

01:23:43.552 --> 01:23:46.255
Amazing scientific changes
in the last few years,

01:23:46.289 --> 01:23:48.124
captain, wouldn't you agree?

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:49.592
I wouldn't know.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:52.661
In certain fields,
it's been incredible.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:55.298
Well, if you say so.

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:56.665
Like DNA...

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:59.402
If it's there,
it's there forever.

01:24:01.337 --> 01:24:03.406
But then you probably
already knew that.

01:24:05.441 --> 01:24:08.043
Those are hers,
aren't they?

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.722
I tried to stop it.

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:24.393
I did everything I could,

01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:26.329
but they hated her.

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:29.132
They hated her so much.

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:30.709
They hated that
she was smarter than them,

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:32.235
and they hated
being out there

01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:34.370
with someone who had
to squat to piss.

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:35.738
I tried to save her.

01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:38.774
I did everything I could,
but I couldn't make them stop.

01:24:40.443 --> 01:24:43.346
Who were the others?

01:24:43.379 --> 01:24:45.514
It was my recon squad.

01:24:45.548 --> 01:24:47.716
Names are in the yearbook.

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:51.287
Liz was my friend.

01:24:55.358 --> 01:24:57.460
Thank you very much,
captain,

01:24:57.493 --> 01:24:58.861
for your cooperation.

01:24:58.894 --> 01:25:01.096
Someone from cid
will be in touch.

01:25:05.768 --> 01:25:06.735
What are you doing?

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.737
What does it look like?

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.606
What about the DNA?

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:12.741
What DNA?

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:15.244
I bought those
an hour ago.

01:25:15.278 --> 01:25:18.214
So long, honey.

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:46.209
That's a positive
match, right?

01:25:46.242 --> 01:25:48.211
Cal: Yeah, Paul. It's
only a partial boot print,

01:25:48.244 --> 01:25:49.778
but it's definitely
colonel Fowler's

01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:51.380
and it's right
next to the body.

01:25:51.414 --> 01:25:52.881
Good. Good work.

01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:54.793
Now, look, we've only got
till the end of the day,

01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:57.386
then the feds are gonna be
all over us. Gotta go.

01:25:58.521 --> 01:25:59.655
Hi.

01:25:59.688 --> 01:26:00.965
Look, I got a lot
on my plate just now.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:03.192
I just want to thank you
for everything you did.

01:26:03.226 --> 01:26:04.126
For what?

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:07.162
For leaving the medical
records in the car.

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:11.834
Now, did he instruct you to
give me the medical records?

01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:13.802
Not in so many words,

01:26:13.836 --> 01:26:15.738
but I think I knew
his wishes.

01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:16.981
Anything that might
help Elisabeth.

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.807
I'm sure you know
how much he loved her.

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:21.744
Not as much
as he loved you.

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:22.811
What do you mean?

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:24.813
I don't know.
Just something about

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:26.949
the surprise way
you came in that night,

01:26:26.982 --> 01:26:29.818
the extra care he had
in making dinner.

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.687
What do you plan
on doing about it?

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.357
Not a thing, other than to
tell you I'm sorry about Moore

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:36.859
and to ask you for your help.
Here, sit down.

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:38.761
What exactly
do you need to know?

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:40.763
I want to know
about the recreation

01:26:40.796 --> 01:26:42.831
of the original rape.

01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:45.301
I suppose that's
what it was.

01:26:45.334 --> 01:26:47.470
Was it Moore's idea
to do this,

01:26:47.503 --> 01:26:49.305
to cleanse her
of her past?

01:26:49.338 --> 01:26:52.308
Oh, no. Jesus, no.
She thought it up.

01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:54.377
He couldn't talk her
out of it.

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:58.481
So he felt so bad
that he killed himself?

01:26:58.514 --> 01:27:00.949
Look, you and I both know
that's not how this happened.

01:27:00.983 --> 01:27:05.421
And that is where they
screwed up, whoever did this,

01:27:05.454 --> 01:27:08.424
because they didn't know
about Bob and me.

01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:11.427
Bob could no sooner
have killed himself

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.796
than I could pull
a chicken out of my ear.

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:15.640
But these nefarious types,
they don't get that.

01:27:15.664 --> 01:27:18.401
They don't understand that.
Affairs of the heart.

01:27:18.434 --> 01:27:20.002
Way beyond them.

01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:22.871
Ok, so he staged
this thing, ok?

01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:25.474
He tied her up, got rid
of her clothes, what?

01:27:25.508 --> 01:27:28.577
Yeah. He also had to make
the call to the general

01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:29.878
and play him the tape.

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:32.247
The tape?

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:52.267
Joe, brenner.

01:28:02.745 --> 01:28:03.846
Paul...

01:28:03.879 --> 01:28:05.548
Come in, please.

01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:11.920
Just wanted
to say good-bye, sir.

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:14.457
I'll be driving back to
headquarters in the morning.

01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:16.925
I'm leaving
tomorrow, too.

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:19.795
I'm taking Elisabeth
up to Michigan

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:22.064
to be buried
next to her mother.

01:28:23.532 --> 01:28:27.970
Thank you...
For everything you did.

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:29.948
I understand you're still
going into politics, sir.

01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:33.642
Oh... the jury's
still out.

01:28:33.676 --> 01:28:35.310
We'll see.

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:40.082
When you just thanked me
for what I had done,

01:28:40.115 --> 01:28:42.385
what I wanted
to say to you

01:28:42.418 --> 01:28:45.954
was I really
didn't do anything.

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:47.556
At least not
anything right.

01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:49.958
I did a lot of things
that were wrong.

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:52.828
You're not responsible
for Moore's death, Paul.

01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:55.097
Any good investigator has
to follow his instincts.

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:58.967
I'd like to talk to you
about that, sir.

01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:01.970
We know Moore did it, then
killed himself out of guilt.

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:03.539
Then we're all
in agreement.

01:29:03.572 --> 01:29:06.975
Then I got thinking,
what if I was wrong?

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:08.977
What if it wasn't
the same car 3 times,

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:10.846
but 3 different cars?

01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:12.615
That's certainly
an interesting theory,

01:29:12.648 --> 01:29:15.117
but what difference does it
make since Moore is dead?

01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:16.985
Probably none, sir,

01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:19.455
but it got me thinking
about your daughter

01:29:19.488 --> 01:29:21.356
and what she told me
she taught.

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:25.994
"Mostly we fuck with
people's minds," she said.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:27.796
Fowler: Ok, then...

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:30.633
Thank you, brenner.

01:29:30.666 --> 01:29:32.000
You can go now.

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.004
Tell me about the rape.

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:37.606
Fowler:
But she wasn't raped!

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.175
It was just made
to appear that way.

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:43.512
The rape at west point.

01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:47.049
It was kept
confidential,

01:29:47.082 --> 01:29:48.617
for the good
of the academy.

01:29:48.651 --> 01:29:50.018
And the army.

01:29:50.052 --> 01:29:53.622
And it was best for
Elisabeth that way.

01:29:53.656 --> 01:29:56.024
You were in Germany
when it happened.

01:29:56.058 --> 01:29:59.161
Berlin. I was
stationed there.

01:29:59.194 --> 01:30:00.963
I came back as
soon as I heard.

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:02.465
Fowler:
We flew all night.

01:30:02.498 --> 01:30:04.767
And you went straight there
from the airport.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.769
Fowler: Of course!

01:30:06.802 --> 01:30:08.403
No meeting first?

01:30:12.608 --> 01:30:15.043
Seems Mr. brenner
is very well-informed.

01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:17.546
It was in her
psych record, sir.

01:30:18.814 --> 01:30:21.984
It didn't happen that way!

01:30:22.017 --> 01:30:26.054
George... he's right.

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:28.491
The meeting
did come first.

01:30:30.092 --> 01:30:31.193
It was 7 years ago.

01:30:31.226 --> 01:30:34.096
The details
get confusing.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:35.698
It was nothing.

01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:38.601
Just a quick briefing in
a hotel near the point.

01:30:38.634 --> 01:30:42.605
General sonnenberg,
he was very...

01:30:42.638 --> 01:30:44.106
Sympathetic.

01:30:45.808 --> 01:30:49.812
I want justice
for my daughter.

01:30:49.845 --> 01:30:53.682
I would give anything
if this had never happened,

01:30:53.716 --> 01:30:56.084
but it did, and I'm
trying to tell you

01:30:56.118 --> 01:30:58.086
the reality
of the situation.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:01.890
We'll never find them,
so we'll never know who did it.

01:31:01.924 --> 01:31:03.659
But we do know this...

01:31:03.692 --> 01:31:08.263
A coed academy is a good call,
a necessary call.

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:12.100
Better one unreported
and unvindicated rape

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:15.270
than to shake the foundations
of west point...

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.706
To cast suspicion
on a thousand soldiers

01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:22.044
who did not gang-rape
a woman that night.

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:26.114
All you have to do
is convince your daughter

01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:29.585
that she, the academy,

01:31:29.618 --> 01:31:33.989
the army, and the cause of
equality would be best served

01:31:34.022 --> 01:31:37.993
if she just forgot
about the whole thing.

01:31:38.026 --> 01:31:40.863
These are the times
we live in, Joe.

01:31:42.164 --> 01:31:44.132
Campbell: He was right.

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:47.002
If it had gone public,
it would have

01:31:47.035 --> 01:31:50.072
permanently damaged
women in the military.

01:31:52.174 --> 01:31:54.076
It would have destroyed
west point.

01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:56.144
It was an
untenable situation.

01:31:56.178 --> 01:31:58.146
Is that what
you told Elisabeth?

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:01.717
Not in
so many words, no.

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:04.319
She was...

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:08.323
In no condition
to understand that then.

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:12.227
I simply tried to tell
her that I loved her.

01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:17.600
I loved her very much.

01:32:18.734 --> 01:32:20.335
Daddy loves you...

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:21.870
Mmm.

01:32:21.904 --> 01:32:25.107
And he's so proud
of you.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:28.176
Shh. Rest now.

01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:31.113
Try not to think
about it anymore.

01:32:31.146 --> 01:32:32.981
Shh. No, shh.

01:32:33.015 --> 01:32:35.283
Baby, listen to me.

01:32:35.317 --> 01:32:38.821
I only want what's
best for you.

01:32:38.854 --> 01:32:39.622
Trust me.

01:32:39.655 --> 01:32:44.559
Do you? Hmm?
Like you always did?

01:32:48.664 --> 01:32:53.201
Then don't ever think
about any of this again.

01:32:53.235 --> 01:32:57.673
I know, I know,
it was an awful thing.

01:32:57.706 --> 01:33:00.008
A terrible,
terrible thing.

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:03.746
But thinking about it
won't help it,

01:33:03.779 --> 01:33:05.848
so...

01:33:07.282 --> 01:33:09.952
Close your eyes.

01:33:12.254 --> 01:33:15.758
It never happened.

01:33:15.791 --> 01:33:17.760
None of this...

01:33:17.793 --> 01:33:20.262
Ever happened.

01:33:45.287 --> 01:33:48.256
Not my finest hour.

01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:50.859
Fowler: You were just
doing what you said...

01:33:50.893 --> 01:33:53.061
Trying to protect her.

01:33:53.095 --> 01:33:56.264
I did what I had to.

01:33:56.298 --> 01:34:00.736
What I thought best
for everyone concerned.

01:34:00.769 --> 01:34:04.272
There's nothing else
that could've been done.

01:34:04.306 --> 01:34:06.441
We never would have
found them anyway.

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:11.714
Here you are, sir.

01:34:11.747 --> 01:34:12.815
What is that?

01:34:12.848 --> 01:34:17.019
Names of the perpetrators
by associate agent sunhill,

01:34:17.052 --> 01:34:18.754
found with
a minimum of trouble.

01:34:18.787 --> 01:34:20.723
Apple pie, sir.

01:34:22.224 --> 01:34:25.193
Campbell: That's
just brilliant.

01:34:25.227 --> 01:34:27.329
Each man will be looking
at 20 years, sir.

01:34:27.362 --> 01:34:29.231
Fowler: I think
you'd better go now.

01:34:29.264 --> 01:34:31.399
Fine.

01:34:31.433 --> 01:34:33.769
We'll just deal with the
phone call issue tomorrow.

01:34:33.802 --> 01:34:37.105
If you prefer.
Perhaps before your flight.

01:34:37.139 --> 01:34:39.307
What phone call issue?

01:34:39.341 --> 01:34:41.844
I've excellent
reason to believe

01:34:41.877 --> 01:34:44.312
that Moore phoned
you at 0300 hours

01:34:44.346 --> 01:34:46.348
the night
of the murder.

01:34:47.983 --> 01:34:50.318
Why in the world
would he have done that?

01:34:50.352 --> 01:34:51.920
Well, if I'm right, sir,

01:34:51.954 --> 01:34:53.922
I think the whole
recreation of the rape

01:34:53.956 --> 01:34:56.024
was Elisabeth's idea.

01:34:56.058 --> 01:34:57.492
God knows why she did it.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:34:59.461
Perhaps because you were
going into politics,

01:34:59.494 --> 01:35:01.429
she thought this was
her last chance.

01:35:01.463 --> 01:35:03.198
But I think
she got Moore to put her

01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:07.202
in exactly the same position
the rapists did 7 years ago.

01:35:07.235 --> 01:35:08.512
This time
you weren't in Germany,

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:11.273
and if I'm right,
she would have wanted you

01:35:11.306 --> 01:35:13.275
to see firsthand
what you covered up.

01:35:13.308 --> 01:35:16.344
That never happened.

01:35:16.378 --> 01:35:18.847
A gift from Moore's lawyer.

01:35:18.881 --> 01:35:20.482
Tape:
Dad, this is Elisabeth.

01:35:20.515 --> 01:35:23.351
I need to discuss something
extremely urgent with you.

01:35:23.385 --> 01:35:25.087
You must meet me
at the mount site

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.455
no later than 0330 hours.

01:35:27.489 --> 01:35:30.725
I have an answer
to your ultimatum.

01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:35.397
It's hard to argue
with a recorded voice.

01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:37.365
I'm sure that was
part of her plan.

01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:40.302
What does she mean
by an ultimatum, sir?

01:35:40.335 --> 01:35:43.371
I gave her 2 options...

01:35:43.405 --> 01:35:45.507
Resign her commission

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:49.111
or agree to some
sort of therapy.

01:35:49.144 --> 01:35:51.479
If she rejected
both of those,

01:35:51.513 --> 01:35:53.816
I would instruct
the staff judge advocate

01:35:53.849 --> 01:35:55.550
to investigate
her misconduct

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:59.287
and draw up charges for
a general court-martial.

01:35:59.321 --> 01:36:03.926
I'm sure that seems
callous to you.

01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:06.194
So you drove out
to the mount site.

01:36:06.228 --> 01:36:09.031
Of course.

01:36:09.064 --> 01:36:10.765
I needed an answer.

01:36:12.567 --> 01:36:15.103
Elisabeth: Here's the answer
to your damn ultimatum!

01:36:15.137 --> 01:36:17.405
Jesus Christ!

01:36:17.439 --> 01:36:20.175
Do you see what
they did to me?

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:21.543
Do you see?

01:36:21.576 --> 01:36:24.279
Don't turn away,
you coward!

01:36:24.312 --> 01:36:28.416
Come closer! Get a better look!
See what they put me through!

01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:30.886
What the fuck do you
hope to accomplish?

01:36:30.919 --> 01:36:33.989
There's a rope
around my neck.

01:36:34.022 --> 01:36:35.423
You can strangle me
if you want to

01:36:35.457 --> 01:36:38.994
or you can just cover it up
like you did before.

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:42.164
Have you gone completely
out of your mind?!

01:36:43.932 --> 01:36:46.234
It happened.

01:36:46.268 --> 01:36:47.802
It happened!

01:36:49.204 --> 01:36:51.073
I want to hear
you say it happened!

01:36:51.106 --> 01:36:56.378
I don't give a damn what
happened to you 7 years ago.

01:36:56.411 --> 01:36:58.146
Whatever hurts you
makes me stronger.

01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:01.149
That which does not destroy me
makes me stronger.

01:37:01.183 --> 01:37:04.953
You can't hurt me
anymore.

01:37:07.489 --> 01:37:08.556
We're even.

01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:12.160
That's fine with me.

01:37:12.194 --> 01:37:14.062
You never helped me!

01:37:16.098 --> 01:37:17.966
Daddy, please don't go.

01:37:19.367 --> 01:37:20.869
Come back...

01:37:20.903 --> 01:37:23.071
Please.

01:37:23.105 --> 01:37:25.173
Please don't...

01:37:28.443 --> 01:37:30.212
Daddy...

01:37:39.554 --> 01:37:43.291
Brenner: So you were
in the second car.

01:37:43.325 --> 01:37:47.229
Which means
colonel Fowler...

01:37:47.262 --> 01:37:48.997
Must have been
in the third.

01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:56.538
You couldn't expect the man
to deal with his own child.

01:37:56.571 --> 01:38:00.175
She was screaming such
vituperations at him.

01:38:03.078 --> 01:38:04.879
Course not.

01:38:06.048 --> 01:38:08.516
So he called me...

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:10.518
And he asked me
to deal with it.

01:38:10.552 --> 01:38:13.888
And I went.

01:38:15.157 --> 01:38:17.192
And I found her dead.

01:38:19.594 --> 01:38:21.696
You found her dead?

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:23.398
Of course.

01:38:23.431 --> 01:38:28.603
But you will never get me to
testify against the general.

01:38:30.438 --> 01:38:31.573
What?

01:38:31.606 --> 01:38:35.543
I've been by
Joe Campbell's side

01:38:35.577 --> 01:38:38.013
too many times.

01:38:38.046 --> 01:38:41.183
Looked death in
the face with him...

01:38:41.216 --> 01:38:43.318
Too many times.

01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:45.553
I will not back down now.

01:38:45.587 --> 01:38:48.556
What in god's name
are you talking about?

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:52.594
It wasn't like she
didn't give him reason.

01:38:52.627 --> 01:38:54.596
George,
for Christ's sake!

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:58.566
And then
when we realized

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:04.306
she was...
Fucking everybody

01:39:04.339 --> 01:39:07.109
from bill Kent
to Jake elby,

01:39:07.142 --> 01:39:09.577
it was too late
for official action.

01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:12.114
Colonel Fowler!

01:39:12.147 --> 01:39:16.318
We would have had to ask
for all their resignations.

01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:18.120
Strangulation,
you think?

01:39:18.153 --> 01:39:20.255
Then resign ourselves.

01:39:21.556 --> 01:39:24.526
You need
civilian authority.

01:39:24.559 --> 01:39:25.960
What happened to you?

01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:30.132
You had no
other choice, sir.

01:39:30.165 --> 01:39:33.601
You think I killed
my own daughter?

01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:35.603
It'll die with me, Joe.

01:39:35.637 --> 01:39:39.674
You sorry son of a bitch.

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:43.211
Where's Moore?
He was released.

01:39:43.245 --> 01:39:44.346
Oh, my god.

01:39:47.782 --> 01:39:49.484
Seiver.

01:39:49.517 --> 01:39:50.618
Cal, it's me.

01:39:50.652 --> 01:39:52.087
You arrest Fowler?

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:53.621
No. Let me speak
to sunhill.

01:39:53.655 --> 01:39:55.423
She's not here.
Got in about an hour ago,

01:39:55.457 --> 01:39:56.767
then went back out
to the crime scene.

01:39:56.791 --> 01:39:58.160
She go out there alone?

01:39:58.193 --> 01:40:00.628
No, sir. She took
the big dog with her.

01:40:00.662 --> 01:40:03.231
Captain America
himself... Kent.

01:40:04.232 --> 01:40:07.269
His idea. He wants you
to meet them out there.

01:40:07.302 --> 01:40:08.270
Yeah, of course he does.

01:40:08.303 --> 01:40:11.773
Shit!

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:27.021
Sunhill!

01:40:32.827 --> 01:40:34.662
Bill, we've been through
this whole place

01:40:34.696 --> 01:40:36.564
a dozen times before.
We're not gonna get

01:40:36.598 --> 01:40:38.633
anything else
out of this.

01:40:44.839 --> 01:40:46.174
Paul?

01:40:47.209 --> 01:40:49.111
Sure, sure.

01:40:49.144 --> 01:40:50.412
Paul.

01:40:53.315 --> 01:40:54.149
I think the three of us

01:40:54.182 --> 01:40:56.684
need to go back to
your office and talk.

01:40:56.718 --> 01:40:58.686
I've always been
an outdoorsy kind of guy.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.555
Why don't we
talk here? Kent.

01:41:00.588 --> 01:41:04.626
That is if we have anything
really important to talk about.

01:41:04.659 --> 01:41:05.793
I thought you'd do your job.

01:41:05.827 --> 01:41:09.164
Pin it on Moore,
then move the fuck on.

01:41:09.197 --> 01:41:10.565
Oh, god.

01:41:10.598 --> 01:41:11.766
But I forgot

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:14.702
you were the nastiest rat
in the shithouse.

01:41:14.736 --> 01:41:16.171
Just goes to show you.

01:41:16.204 --> 01:41:18.206
Why'd you do it?

01:41:19.507 --> 01:41:20.842
Why?

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:22.710
Well, you tell me.
You're the expert.

01:41:22.744 --> 01:41:25.180
I think this was a woman

01:41:25.213 --> 01:41:27.315
giving it out
all over the post,

01:41:27.349 --> 01:41:28.816
and the one man
who cared about her,

01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:30.852
the one who's willing
to risk it all for her,

01:41:30.885 --> 01:41:32.854
is the person
she doesn't want.

01:41:32.887 --> 01:41:37.091
And that's because she
couldn't want anybody.

01:41:43.265 --> 01:41:46.734
See, I just wanted
to be with her forever.

01:41:46.768 --> 01:41:48.470
She owned my heart.

01:41:49.704 --> 01:41:50.872
She tormented me.

01:41:50.905 --> 01:41:54.809
She became my obsession.

01:41:56.778 --> 01:41:58.746
So I followed her

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.749
and found her
out there on the range...

01:42:01.783 --> 01:42:03.918
On display.

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:05.887
Elisabeth.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.923
Get out of here, bill.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:11.926
He'll come back,
i know he will.

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:14.396
You can't be around.
You'll ruin it all.

01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:16.764
What are you doing out here?

01:42:16.798 --> 01:42:18.500
What's all this about?

01:42:18.533 --> 01:42:19.767
Did my father send you?

01:42:19.801 --> 01:42:20.902
Is that why you're here?

01:42:20.935 --> 01:42:21.603
No.

01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:23.505
Did he send you
to shut me up?

01:42:23.538 --> 01:42:25.540
No.

01:42:25.573 --> 01:42:26.774
No.

01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:29.544
Well, this time
i won't be quiet.

01:42:29.577 --> 01:42:32.214
This time I'm gonna
tell everything.

01:42:32.247 --> 01:42:34.416
About him,
shh. About you.

01:42:34.449 --> 01:42:35.783
I'm gonna
tell your wife.

01:42:35.817 --> 01:42:38.520
I'm gonna tell
your kids.

01:42:38.553 --> 01:42:40.788
Shh.

01:42:40.822 --> 01:42:41.789
Don't touch me.

01:42:41.823 --> 01:42:44.826
Get your hands
off me.

01:42:50.598 --> 01:42:52.400
You repulse me.
Shh, shh.

01:42:52.434 --> 01:42:53.468
You're a disgrace.

01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:54.802
You're not a soldier.

01:42:54.836 --> 01:42:56.704
You're not even a man.

01:42:56.738 --> 01:42:58.673
You're just a fuck.

01:42:58.706 --> 01:43:01.175
I fucked you.

01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:09.551
Oh, Christ!

01:43:14.289 --> 01:43:15.557
God!

01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:31.005
Brenner: Come on, bill,
let's get going.

01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:33.408
Come on.

01:43:38.746 --> 01:43:41.349
I'm all yours, Paulie.

01:43:41.383 --> 01:43:42.016
Whoa!

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:43.951
Before you come
any closer,

01:43:43.985 --> 01:43:47.589
don't you want to know
where you're standing?

01:43:47.622 --> 01:43:48.856
Where am I standing?

01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:50.692
In a minefield.

01:43:50.725 --> 01:43:52.360
Aw, come on, bill.

01:43:52.394 --> 01:43:54.729
I buried some
bouncing betties.

01:43:54.762 --> 01:43:56.598
Antipersonnel.

01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:57.965
You buy that?

01:43:57.999 --> 01:43:59.601
You're reasonably
safe here, Paul.

01:43:59.634 --> 01:44:01.303
But little miss
can't-be-wrong

01:44:01.336 --> 01:44:02.370
over there...

01:44:02.404 --> 01:44:04.872
She's deep
in the hurt locker.

01:44:04.906 --> 01:44:07.809
You remember how
the Betty works?

01:44:07.842 --> 01:44:10.545
First man trips
the primary,

01:44:10.578 --> 01:44:11.746
mine shoots up,

01:44:11.779 --> 01:44:13.815
the rest of the column
walks into the blast.

01:44:13.848 --> 01:44:16.551
Heads are removed,
or limbs. Whatever.

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:18.886
Backtrack
the way you came.

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.888
You know, it's amazing
what a load of shrapnel

01:44:20.922 --> 01:44:22.757
will do to flesh and bone.

01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:24.726
Brenner:
Sarah, you're fine.

01:44:24.759 --> 01:44:26.260
God.

01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:30.765
Boom!

01:44:30.798 --> 01:44:32.900
Scared you, didn't I?

01:44:32.934 --> 01:44:34.636
You're an asshole,
Kent.

01:44:35.803 --> 01:44:37.305
Come on, bill,
it's over.

01:44:39.474 --> 01:44:41.376
Yeah, it's over.

01:44:44.846 --> 01:44:47.281
But not the way you think.

01:45:16.878 --> 01:45:18.480
Atten-hut!

01:45:18.513 --> 01:45:20.081
Present!

01:45:20.114 --> 01:45:21.683
Hut!

01:45:21.716 --> 01:45:23.117
Shoulder!

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:23.951
Hut!

01:45:23.985 --> 01:45:25.553
Left shoulder!

01:45:25.587 --> 01:45:27.555
Hut!

01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:32.660
The human eye can distinguish
16 shades of gray.

01:45:32.694 --> 01:45:35.963
A computer image processor
analyzing a fingerprint

01:45:35.997 --> 01:45:38.866
can distinguish
256 shades of gray,

01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.968
which is impressive.

01:45:41.002 --> 01:45:44.038
The human heart,
mind, and soul, however,

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:46.974
can distinguish an infinite
number of emotional,

01:45:47.008 --> 01:45:49.711
psychological,
and moral shadings.

01:45:49.744 --> 01:45:52.647
In psy ops we deal
with the blackest of black

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.749
and the whitest of white.

01:45:54.782 --> 01:45:56.150
Thank you.

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:57.385
Ahem.

01:46:00.555 --> 01:46:01.889
At ease, soldier.

01:46:09.864 --> 01:46:11.433
Is colonel Fowler coming?

01:46:11.466 --> 01:46:14.736
No. He's taking
some much-needed r&r.

01:46:14.769 --> 01:46:16.838
He's a good man, George.

01:46:16.871 --> 01:46:20.007
A good man
and a good soldier.

01:46:20.041 --> 01:46:22.844
Sometimes the lines
get a little blurred,

01:46:22.877 --> 01:46:25.847
but when push
comes to shove,

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.882
he'll do
what needs to be done.

01:46:27.915 --> 01:46:30.017
And what is that, sir?

01:46:30.051 --> 01:46:33.888
Why, say Moore
called him, of course,

01:46:33.921 --> 01:46:36.157
and that i
was never out there.

01:46:36.190 --> 01:46:38.125
He'll do that for me...

01:46:38.159 --> 01:46:40.895
Even if it means
his career...

01:46:40.928 --> 01:46:43.898
Like a good soldier.

01:46:43.931 --> 01:46:48.102
Nothing is gained
by my involvement.

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:51.138
A letter of commendation
will be inserted

01:46:51.172 --> 01:46:54.175
into your file...

01:46:54.208 --> 01:46:58.680
In recognition of your
exemplary work on this case.

01:47:06.087 --> 01:47:07.889
Remember
when I asked you

01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:09.524
if you were a cop
or a soldier?

01:47:09.557 --> 01:47:10.925
Yes, sir.

01:47:10.958 --> 01:47:14.996
Well, you're
a soldier, Paul...

01:47:15.029 --> 01:47:17.431
And a damn fine one.

01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:29.677
General Campbell.

01:47:30.778 --> 01:47:32.079
You're wrong.

01:47:32.113 --> 01:47:33.915
I'm a rotten soldier.

01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:35.249
Oh? And why is that?

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:38.520
You really don't
get it, do you?

01:47:38.553 --> 01:47:39.386
The only mind

01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:43.024
Elisabeth wanted
to fuck with was yours.

01:47:45.059 --> 01:47:47.595
And you still don't get it.

01:47:48.996 --> 01:47:51.165
I've done nothing wrong.

01:47:52.667 --> 01:47:55.469
You killed her.

01:47:57.138 --> 01:47:59.040
What did you say?

01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:02.710
7 years ago
in that hospital room

01:48:02.744 --> 01:48:04.946
when you told her
to just forget about it,

01:48:04.979 --> 01:48:06.748
you killed her.

01:48:06.781 --> 01:48:09.684
Kent killed her.

01:48:09.717 --> 01:48:13.721
No. Kent just put her
out of her misery.

01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:18.025
I once asked Moore
what was worse than rape.

01:48:18.059 --> 01:48:20.762
Now I know.

01:48:20.795 --> 01:48:23.297
Betrayal.

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.633
I loved Elisabeth...

01:48:25.667 --> 01:48:28.903
But there were larger
issues to consider.

01:48:28.936 --> 01:48:31.806
You traded her trust
for your career.

01:48:31.839 --> 01:48:34.609
You made a deal, didn't you?

01:48:34.642 --> 01:48:36.878
You kept silent,
and they gave you another star.

01:48:36.911 --> 01:48:38.580
You watch your mouth,
brenner.

01:48:38.613 --> 01:48:40.214
I'm gonna say that
in my report,

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:41.749
that you knew
she was out there,

01:48:41.783 --> 01:48:43.618
that you went out
and talked to her

01:48:43.651 --> 01:48:45.887
and left her there
to die.

01:48:47.188 --> 01:48:49.757
You don't have
the balls.

01:48:49.791 --> 01:48:51.593
Oh, you're wrong, sir...

01:48:51.626 --> 01:48:54.161
Because that's just about
all I have left.

01:48:54.195 --> 01:48:55.763
You do that,

01:48:55.797 --> 01:48:58.299
and you can kiss
your career good-bye.

01:48:58.332 --> 01:49:00.868
I'm gonna have you
court-martialed, general,

01:49:00.902 --> 01:49:04.338
under article 32 for conspiracy
to conceal a crime.

01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:10.912
Soldier: Ah-hut!

01:49:24.225 --> 01:49:27.261
Soldier: Atten-hut!

01:49:38.072 --> 01:49:39.807
When this all started,

01:49:39.841 --> 01:49:44.378
I told you that we would find
the son of a bitch, sir.

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:48.850
I never expected that the son
of a bitch would be you.

01:49:52.253 --> 01:49:54.388
Soldier: Firing party!

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:55.657
Ready!

01:49:58.159 --> 01:49:59.761
Aim!

01:49:59.794 --> 01:50:01.062
Fire!

01:50:01.095 --> 01:50:03.130
Aim!

01:50:03.164 --> 01:50:04.598
Fire!

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.134
Aim!

01:50:07.168 --> 01:50:08.602
Fire!

01:50:14.742 --> 01:50:16.310
Present!

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.980
Arms!

01:51:55.242 --> 01:51:59.180
