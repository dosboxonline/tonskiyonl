INSPECTOR CHAN

01:50.070 --> 01:53.060
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS

02:04.120 --> 02:06.250
Anyone else?

02:13.960 --> 02:16.590
Such a beautiful woman...

02:16.760 --> 02:20.130
...and you arrest her...

02:20.300 --> 02:23.030
...just for spitting?

02:24.170 --> 02:26.940
Is there no justice?

02:27.640 --> 02:30.200
Is there no law?

02:31.110 --> 02:33.770
Commissioner is only your boss...

02:33.950 --> 02:36.540
...because he paid his dues
to the Crocodile Gang.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.720
And you don't fucking know me?

02:40.220 --> 02:43.520
Sorry, I didn't know
she was your wife.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.620
Ugly coward!

02:57.910 --> 03:01.140
What are you looking at? Never seen
such a handsome gang boss?

03:08.020 --> 03:10.420
Who'd be in the film business?

03:10.590 --> 03:13.350
It's Sunday,
and the theater's deserted.

03:14.190 --> 03:15.660
Where's the car?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.490
Let's go back inside!

03:50.060 --> 03:51.580
Call for help!

03:53.730 --> 03:56.360
No need for that, Northerner.

03:56.530 --> 04:01.870
While you were messing with the cop,
your men signed up with us.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.370
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!

04:40.010 --> 04:44.240
Stop! You forget the time
I treated you to dinner.

04:55.290 --> 04:56.450
Brother Sum.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.290
Please...

05:07.040 --> 05:08.700
Please spare me.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.100
Don't worry.

05:11.710 --> 05:15.510
I don't kill women. You can go!

05:16.280 --> 05:17.940
Thank you, Big Brother.

05:31.990 --> 05:34.520
Cops! Come clean up the mess!

06:52.640 --> 06:56.370
THE AXE GANG

06:58.550 --> 06:59.750
In a time of social unrest
and disorder...

06:59.750 --> 07:00.480
In a time of social unrest
and disorder...

07:00.650 --> 07:03.450
...the gangs have moved in
to consolidate their power.

07:03.620 --> 07:06.050
The most feared of them all
is the Axe Gang.

07:06.220 --> 07:10.050
Only in the poorest districts,
which hold no interest for the gangs...

07:10.220 --> 07:11.890
...can people live in peace.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.060
PIG STY ALLE Y

07:37.020 --> 07:38.510
One, two, three!

07:39.590 --> 07:41.420
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!

07:59.540 --> 08:00.940
TAILOR

08:05.280 --> 08:06.680
NOODLES AND CONGEE

08:27.470 --> 08:30.060
My check, please, Donut.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.970
- How much?
- It's on the house!

08:36.180 --> 08:37.340
Donut.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.840
- It's nothing.
- I like you.

08:40.010 --> 08:43.010
I'll ask the wife about
lowering your rent.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.420
Morning, Landlord!

08:48.490 --> 08:49.480
Landlord!

08:49.660 --> 08:51.320
Jill! How you've grown!

08:51.490 --> 08:53.690
Come let me examine you!

09:06.340 --> 09:08.670
Good to see you, Landlord!

09:08.840 --> 09:10.330
What's so good about it?

09:10.510 --> 09:11.670
Don't...!

09:17.520 --> 09:22.850
Can you make the skirt slit higher?

09:23.520 --> 09:25.050
Sure!

09:25.230 --> 09:26.690
Look, a comet!

09:30.230 --> 09:31.720
Jane! You naughty girl!

09:31.900 --> 09:35.600
Landlord! You're such a scoundrel!

09:37.740 --> 09:42.730
Don't go, Jane! Stay and chat!

09:43.040 --> 09:46.210
I'm only kidding. Jane!

10:06.670 --> 10:08.070
Landlady!

10:08.870 --> 10:10.340
Landlady!

10:13.440 --> 10:15.970
What happened to the water?

10:30.420 --> 10:31.580
Water ain't free!

10:31.760 --> 10:35.990
You talk a lot for someone
who won't pay his rent.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.860
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.500
You think that's a problem?

10:41.670 --> 10:44.700
From now on, no water on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays.

10:44.870 --> 10:47.810
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Saturdays.

10:47.980 --> 10:52.840
I just love hearing you fools
complain. Assholes!

10:53.010 --> 10:54.210
Good morning, Landlady!

10:54.380 --> 10:58.610
Just pay your rent,
or I'll burn your shop down.

10:59.350 --> 11:02.520
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!

11:04.490 --> 11:08.450
Serves you right you're a coolie!

11:08.630 --> 11:11.830
Months overdue and not even
a "good morning."

11:12.000 --> 11:13.860
You'll be a coolie for life.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.710
There you go, handsome!

11:25.650 --> 11:28.080
What took you so long
with the congee?

11:28.250 --> 11:31.150
I stopped to help an old lady
cross the street.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.080
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.490
Was someone just spying on you,
Auntie Six?

11:36.660 --> 11:40.220
Don't shoot your mouth off
without proof.

11:43.330 --> 11:46.270
She's crazy.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.530
Go away!

12:39.550 --> 12:41.950
Please can you teach us, sir?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.220
No more soccer!

13:19.530 --> 13:21.760
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.590
Take a seat.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.970
Done! Fifty cents, please.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.010
Isn't it great?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.810
It's too good!

13:44.690 --> 13:46.850
Why'd you make him look so good?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.950
Why?

13:56.360 --> 14:00.030
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy. I'll handle this.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.700
He's boss of the Axe Gang. Don't you
see the two axes? We're bad guys.

14:05.870 --> 14:08.710
Making him look good
is really bad. Understand?

14:08.880 --> 14:11.170
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!

14:11.410 --> 14:14.970
But I like you, so just pay me,
and I'll take care of it.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.210
No way!

14:18.490 --> 14:22.250
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.990
I really care for you. You saw it
for yourself. Seriously.

14:28.160 --> 14:32.500
Why don't you pay up. Not much.
Enough for a drink.

14:32.670 --> 14:34.830
Oh, so it's blackmail!

14:36.670 --> 14:38.000
Boss!

14:38.840 --> 14:40.000
Boss!

14:43.840 --> 14:47.010
Now you're dead!

14:47.180 --> 14:49.710
Looks like he's waking up!

14:49.880 --> 14:51.220
I'm not afraid.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.350
You can kill me.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.920
But there'll be thousands more of me!

15:00.130 --> 15:03.390
You want to play tough? The Axe
Gang boss is napping in there.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.360
Whoever wants to die,
step forward.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.140
So you want to fight?

15:10.300 --> 15:13.360
Great! We'll go one-on-one.

15:13.540 --> 15:16.700
Don't even think about cheating.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.700
That old woman with the onion!

15:21.050 --> 15:26.380
You look real tough. Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.490
What do you do?

15:32.660 --> 15:34.390
I'm a farmer.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.050
Farmers don't fight. Piss off!

15:38.230 --> 15:39.600
He's crazy!

15:39.770 --> 15:41.290
Calling me names?

15:41.470 --> 15:44.060
You're lucky you're a woman.

15:45.270 --> 15:50.510
Hey, shorty! Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.

15:53.510 --> 15:57.420
What did I say about cheating?

15:57.580 --> 15:58.850
Sit back down!

16:01.860 --> 16:04.520
You! The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.820
No, not you. I mean...

16:11.000 --> 16:12.120
You!

16:12.300 --> 16:15.030
Hey, kid, let's rumble!

16:16.970 --> 16:18.800
All right, all right!

16:19.110 --> 16:22.670
So no one-on-ones today.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.040
You're all such wimps!

16:27.950 --> 16:30.110
He blackmailed me.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.680
Fat woman, you're
in charge here, right?

16:33.850 --> 16:35.620
Fat woman, my ass!

16:35.860 --> 16:37.550
I'm with the Axe Gang!

16:37.730 --> 16:38.850
Axe Gang, my ass!

16:39.030 --> 16:40.020
Boss!

16:40.190 --> 16:41.790
Boss, my ass!

16:42.030 --> 16:44.220
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!

16:44.400 --> 16:46.660
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!

16:50.340 --> 16:52.970
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!

16:53.210 --> 16:57.640
You nitwit! Let's see you call backup!

16:58.980 --> 17:02.640
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.

17:04.150 --> 17:08.820
Don't you go away! Go put
a down payment on your coffin!

17:22.400 --> 17:23.770
Who threw the firecracker?

17:30.010 --> 17:31.500
I'm one of you, brother.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.360
Mind your own business!

17:55.540 --> 17:59.030
It's raining. Go bring in your laundry!

17:59.310 --> 18:00.600
Fat woman!

18:13.590 --> 18:17.890
You blackmailing me too? I ain't afraid.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.200
I...

18:54.860 --> 18:57.890
Did anyone see what happened?

18:58.900 --> 19:01.560
Don't! My back's broken!

19:02.300 --> 19:05.030
Call for help!

19:58.260 --> 20:01.720
Hold on, calm down. You hungry?

20:27.020 --> 20:28.280
Keep quiet.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.100
No.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.450
Who did this?

21:14.330 --> 21:16.230
I'll count to three.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.230
One...

21:23.840 --> 21:25.810
...two...

21:37.290 --> 21:38.450
I did it!

24:56.260 --> 24:58.160
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?

25:00.230 --> 25:01.460
Sorry!

25:04.600 --> 25:06.590
Look away, kid.

25:10.870 --> 25:12.200
Get rid of him!

25:13.570 --> 25:15.560
We're the bad guys!

25:15.740 --> 25:17.770
We're meant to do the ass-kicking...

25:18.750 --> 25:20.870
...not the other way around.

25:21.050 --> 25:24.380
And it's all because these morons
posed as Axes.

25:24.550 --> 25:27.780
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.

25:27.950 --> 25:30.720
We'll handle this.

25:30.890 --> 25:32.790
You! Take care of it.

25:47.010 --> 25:52.070
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living. Give me a break.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.910
Pick that one too, if you're so good.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.300
Come.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.820
I'll count to three.

26:00.620 --> 26:01.640
Hurry!

26:03.390 --> 26:05.220
Ready? Three!

26:15.240 --> 26:17.030
That's quick!

26:18.370 --> 26:20.900
Brother Sum, we really
want to be Axes.

26:21.070 --> 26:23.980
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.

26:24.310 --> 26:25.640
Ever killed anyone?

26:25.810 --> 26:28.300
I've always thought about it.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.080
Then go kill someone.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.220
I will!

26:33.590 --> 26:34.650
Go on!

26:35.060 --> 26:36.550
Thank you, Brother Sum.

26:48.100 --> 26:51.590
We can always find a use for that type.

26:55.010 --> 26:57.840
I told you before,
you've got to look tough.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.500
Tougher!

27:00.850 --> 27:02.610
Tougher!

27:04.680 --> 27:06.240
Act the part.

27:06.420 --> 27:07.890
And try to stay awake.

27:08.050 --> 27:09.420
It's tiring being tough.

27:09.590 --> 27:12.680
Tiring? It's our living!

27:13.830 --> 27:17.520
The streets out there are filled
with money and women.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.430
You only need the will
and determination...

27:20.600 --> 27:23.930
...to seize the opportunity to win.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.760
This is our big chance!

27:25.940 --> 27:28.640
We just kill someone,
and we're in the gang.

27:29.110 --> 27:32.600
Then it'll be money and women
all the way!

27:33.550 --> 27:36.410
Don't be like those beggars...

27:36.620 --> 27:39.350
...with no ambition.

27:44.290 --> 27:47.450
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!

27:48.830 --> 27:50.460
Get lost!

27:50.800 --> 27:52.130
Come here and say that!

27:52.300 --> 27:54.460
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!

27:54.630 --> 27:58.230
The four-eyes, the fat woman
and all the residents of Pig Sty.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.170
But they're good at kung fu.

28:00.340 --> 28:03.170
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?

28:05.310 --> 28:08.970
Didn't I tell you I know
Buddhist Palm kung fu?

28:10.780 --> 28:14.220
Hey there, handsome boy. Stop.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.650
Amazing!

28:19.060 --> 28:23.330
Do you know you have
a special aura?

28:23.930 --> 28:27.370
You're so young, but you have
the bone structure...

28:27.530 --> 28:30.940
and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.

28:31.500 --> 28:35.700
If your chi flow can be channeled,
then you will be invincible!

28:35.880 --> 28:39.440
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.

28:39.910 --> 28:44.680
The duty of upholding world peace
and punishing evil will be yours.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.170
Sure.

28:47.090 --> 28:50.520
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.

28:50.690 --> 28:54.220
But as it's fate,
I'll let you have it for $ 10.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.550
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL

29:02.500 --> 29:05.060
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.500
I was saving to study to be
a doctor or lawyer...

29:08.680 --> 29:11.080
...but this was world peace.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.430
Let go of the girl!

29:56.390 --> 29:59.220
Hey! It's the Buddhist Palm!

29:59.560 --> 30:01.720
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."

30:01.900 --> 30:03.620
You must be loaded.

30:04.030 --> 30:06.190
Have you killed anyone lately?

30:17.480 --> 30:22.380
He's a fool, and she's mute. Losers!

30:24.150 --> 30:27.980
I realized then that good guys
never win. I want to be bad.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.920
I want to be the killer!

30:32.230 --> 30:34.420
- Ice cream!
- Where?

30:35.230 --> 30:36.990
Make mine a vanilla.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.530
Chocolate for me!

30:50.080 --> 30:53.070
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?

30:58.520 --> 30:59.680
Look at her run!

31:15.030 --> 31:20.370
You're such kung-fu masters,
go take it on the road.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.870
You belong in the circus, not here!

31:23.040 --> 31:27.270
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.950
Everyone has his reasons.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.210
We don't want to make trouble.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.080
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.380
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!

31:39.460 --> 31:41.720
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.830
You okay?

31:47.770 --> 31:49.290
Masters.

31:56.910 --> 31:58.900
We have nothing precious
to give you...

31:59.080 --> 32:01.410
...but take this as a token
of our appreciation.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.180
Thanks for saving us!

32:11.930 --> 32:14.920
Stop the crying. This isn't a show!

32:15.090 --> 32:18.660
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?

32:18.830 --> 32:21.630
You may know kung fu,
but you're still a fairy.

32:24.140 --> 32:27.040
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!

32:27.210 --> 32:29.970
Once a fairy, always a fairy.

32:30.140 --> 32:33.670
Look at you. What's with
the red underwear?

32:33.850 --> 32:36.340
Why not a diaper while you're at it.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.640
What's wrong with red underwear?

32:39.890 --> 32:42.720
Where were you
when there was trouble?

32:42.890 --> 32:46.850
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!

32:47.030 --> 32:48.520
I'll reason with you.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.960
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.400
Pay up or pack up!

32:54.570 --> 32:56.730
Don't you worry. I'll pay it.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.390
Think you're a smartass,
Rabbit-Tooth Jane?

32:59.570 --> 33:02.200
What's it to you, tub of lard?

33:02.380 --> 33:03.540
Bitch!

33:04.680 --> 33:06.340
Calm down, Landlady.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.810
This is your fault.

33:12.020 --> 33:14.320
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.650
How could you do that?

33:16.820 --> 33:18.760
Shut the hell up!

33:32.010 --> 33:34.240
You think you can out-yell me?

33:38.340 --> 33:41.110
The fat lady can really sing.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.640
Watch this!

33:58.600 --> 33:59.790
What happened?

34:00.170 --> 34:03.100
What do you mean,
what happened? You try it.

34:03.270 --> 34:05.240
- Me?
- Quick!

34:11.080 --> 34:13.340
Sorry! You okay?

34:14.110 --> 34:17.450
I think you should get closer
and take better aim. Okay?

34:17.620 --> 34:18.610
Okay!

34:30.830 --> 34:33.490
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?

34:35.640 --> 34:37.600
Where's the third knife?

34:38.270 --> 34:40.710
God knows where it went.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.340
Could it be the same one? Can't be...

34:43.510 --> 34:45.270
- Don't!
- Sorry.

34:47.450 --> 34:49.280
What are you trying to say?

34:49.450 --> 34:53.610
I just remembered I have
something to do. See you!

34:56.220 --> 34:58.280
Uh-oh. They've seen us!

34:59.790 --> 35:01.230
Stay back!

35:09.800 --> 35:13.900
Don't panic! Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.630
Please, no more bright ideas.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.210
Oh, what the hell!

35:27.990 --> 35:29.550
Not you again, asshole!

35:29.720 --> 35:33.090
Get back to your business!

35:34.930 --> 35:36.420
Split up!

35:38.700 --> 35:39.860
Split?

37:52.800 --> 37:54.130
What're you doing here?

37:54.300 --> 37:56.460
Looking for you. Weren't you hurt?

37:56.640 --> 37:57.830
I'm fine!

37:59.910 --> 38:02.810
How come you always recover so fast?

38:03.140 --> 38:04.630
I don't know.

38:05.010 --> 38:07.640
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.

38:08.410 --> 38:10.040
Maybe it's better that way.

38:10.220 --> 38:14.920
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!

38:15.090 --> 38:17.920
I never knew you were so deep.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.650
All the sadness one can bear...

38:29.640 --> 38:32.900
...down the river everywhere.

38:35.210 --> 38:36.800
Hey, get out of the way!

38:36.980 --> 38:38.240
Move!

38:38.410 --> 38:40.070
I'll slap you to kingdom come!

38:40.450 --> 38:44.280
Look at those four-eyes
carting around a coffin.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.610
What morons!

38:49.820 --> 38:51.980
Don't blame me for making you leave.

38:52.160 --> 38:56.220
We'll let Buddha decide...

38:56.700 --> 38:59.100
...whether you stay...

38:59.270 --> 39:01.700
...or go.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.600
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE

39:19.590 --> 39:21.350
Have some tea.

39:28.630 --> 39:31.690
We're grateful for
some professional help.

39:31.860 --> 39:35.530
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School...

39:35.700 --> 39:40.700
...Iron Fist from the Hung School
and the Hexagon Staff...

39:41.270 --> 39:43.260
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.710
Their warrior days are long over...

39:46.210 --> 39:49.650
...but they're still top fighters.

39:50.050 --> 39:54.880
This job is a great challenge for us.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.750
Now, that's professionalism.

39:57.920 --> 40:03.260
Number One Killers. Expensive, yes,
but worth every penny!

40:03.430 --> 40:04.420
No!

40:04.600 --> 40:09.660
Number one is the Beast,
the world's top killer.

40:10.140 --> 40:14.440
He was so dedicated to kung fu,
he went crazy.

40:14.610 --> 40:17.910
I heard he's now in an asylum.

40:18.510 --> 40:21.810
So you're the top killers now.

40:21.980 --> 40:26.350
Strictly speaking,
we're just musicians.

40:26.650 --> 40:31.420
A song that wrenches the heart
O where do I find a knowing ear?

40:31.690 --> 40:36.090
Great poem, isn't it?

40:44.170 --> 40:45.690
We'll be saying goodbye soon.

40:45.870 --> 40:48.360
Who knows when we'll see
each other again.

40:49.110 --> 40:53.310
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.

40:53.480 --> 40:56.780
Let's take this opportunity
to spar a little.

40:57.020 --> 41:00.380
No. We still have a lot to pack.

41:01.150 --> 41:02.880
You're right.

41:40.990 --> 41:44.330
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!

41:44.560 --> 41:47.360
Iron Fist: Powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!

41:47.530 --> 41:50.830
Hexagon Staff, with its
thousand moves. Mystical!

41:51.300 --> 41:53.640
Till we meet again!

42:03.320 --> 42:04.300
More lipstick!

42:23.700 --> 42:26.690
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.

43:50.620 --> 43:52.680
Sorry, we're closed.

43:52.860 --> 43:54.880
You can make a suit in no time.

43:55.060 --> 43:56.550
We're moving.

43:56.730 --> 43:58.560
This is good material!

43:59.230 --> 44:01.560
You know your stuff.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.260
This has high artistic value.

44:04.870 --> 44:06.200
How high?

44:06.640 --> 44:08.470
At least a few stories...

45:18.480 --> 45:20.710
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.

45:20.880 --> 45:24.040
Let's kill them all and make
this place a brothel.

45:24.220 --> 45:26.210
Don't block my view!

46:15.770 --> 46:16.760
What's going on?

46:28.210 --> 46:29.340
Good!

46:29.520 --> 46:31.350
Don't block my view!

46:36.520 --> 46:39.690
Damn! I told those nitwits to leave,
but they're still here.

46:39.860 --> 46:41.590
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:05.150 --> 47:09.140
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?

47:09.320 --> 47:11.310
Sorry, sorry. It's nothing!

48:51.990 --> 48:55.050
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.

48:56.190 --> 48:58.090
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!

48:59.000 --> 49:00.490
Die? In this racket?

49:00.670 --> 49:02.690
Sorry, sorry!

49:05.000 --> 49:06.990
Get out of my way!

49:07.770 --> 49:09.500
Hang in there, Tailor.

49:18.480 --> 49:20.610
Be quiet!

49:25.860 --> 49:30.590
Give us a break! Why push us so far?

49:45.280 --> 49:46.470
There's another master?

52:13.590 --> 52:15.580
It's the Lion's Roar!

52:16.260 --> 52:18.090
I thought that was a myth.

52:19.300 --> 52:22.270
Who knew the Lion's Roar
really exists?

52:22.430 --> 52:26.030
That's the last we'll see of them.

52:29.210 --> 52:31.540
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!

52:31.910 --> 52:33.540
Start the car!

52:40.290 --> 52:41.450
Boss!

52:41.620 --> 52:43.880
Keep it down! Have you no manners?

52:44.060 --> 52:46.460
Get lost. People are trying to sleep.

52:46.630 --> 52:49.590
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!

52:52.830 --> 52:54.460
Scumbags!

54:20.320 --> 54:23.340
I can't hang on much longer.

54:25.720 --> 54:29.590
But having seen
real masters like you...

54:30.330 --> 54:32.390
...I can now die in peace.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.500
Don't say that.

54:34.670 --> 54:37.600
We're ordinary folks.

54:37.770 --> 54:39.530
Ordinary's a blessing.

54:39.700 --> 54:43.160
Don't call us masters.

54:43.340 --> 54:45.240
But you're such great fighters!

54:45.410 --> 54:49.680
If only you'd helped earlier,
they wouldn't have to die this way.

54:50.180 --> 54:54.350
Like Donut said,
everyone has his reasons.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.850
Years ago...

54:57.360 --> 55:00.450
...we saw our only son killed in a fight.

55:02.730 --> 55:05.390
Revenge can be devastating.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.930
Do you understand?

55:08.100 --> 55:11.190
Why don't you train us
to be top fighters...

55:11.370 --> 55:14.360
...and we'll avenge them!

55:14.710 --> 55:18.700
Becoming a top fighter takes time.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.440
Unless you're a natural-born
kung-fu genius.

55:21.610 --> 55:25.380
And they're one in a million.

55:32.960 --> 55:35.150
It's obvious I'm the one!

55:38.730 --> 55:40.930
Don't think so.

55:41.900 --> 55:47.270
Everyone! We swore
we'd never fight again.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.840
But we broke that promise today.

55:50.010 --> 55:53.570
For your own safety, please all leave!

55:58.020 --> 56:01.580
In great power lies great responsibility.

56:02.090 --> 56:03.950
There's no escaping from it.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.920
Donut, you're hurt bad.

56:07.090 --> 56:08.650
Rest now.

56:13.600 --> 56:16.030
We can't understand
what you're saying.

56:17.670 --> 56:18.760
Donut!

56:31.820 --> 56:33.810
I know you, four-eyes!

56:35.220 --> 56:39.820
You seem prejudiced against
the sight-challenged.

56:39.990 --> 56:43.290
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.

56:47.530 --> 56:50.870
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.

56:51.040 --> 56:54.130
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?

56:56.510 --> 56:57.500
Help me!

56:59.840 --> 57:03.080
"Help me! Help me!"
Want to play, punks?

57:03.250 --> 57:05.080
The Dragon Style? The Tiger Style?

57:09.820 --> 57:14.260
Come down here, and I'll smash
your glasses. Come on!

57:15.930 --> 57:18.160
You know I'd do it, right?

57:19.500 --> 57:20.830
Swear to it!

57:21.430 --> 57:22.760
Swear!

57:25.600 --> 57:29.900
Have you no respect? Where were you
when I needed you?

57:31.680 --> 57:33.370
You sound like a wimp!

57:33.550 --> 57:36.710
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.

57:36.880 --> 57:40.610
No killing, no arson,
no robberies, no rapes...

57:40.790 --> 57:43.350
...all because of you!

57:43.520 --> 57:45.850
You're a numb-nut!

57:48.260 --> 57:49.590
Follow me!

57:58.270 --> 57:59.900
It's a stickup! Where's the money?

58:04.810 --> 58:07.000
Where's the money?

58:08.610 --> 58:10.740
What're you looking at? I'm serious!

58:15.690 --> 58:19.680
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.

58:38.110 --> 58:39.770
The money's in here.

59:15.710 --> 59:17.540
Let go of the girl!

59:30.560 --> 59:35.230
He's a fool, and she's mute. Losers!

1:00:18.710 --> 1:00:22.110
Go away! You're dragging me down!

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:27.980
Go home and raise pigs.

1:00:32.890 --> 1:00:34.380
Go, before I kill you.

1:01:23.210 --> 1:01:26.610
You! Whatsyourname!

1:01:35.690 --> 1:01:39.120
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!

1:01:39.290 --> 1:01:43.120
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.

1:01:50.030 --> 1:01:51.190
Brother Sum!

1:01:51.370 --> 1:01:55.860
One look at you, and I knew
you'd do anything.

1:01:56.170 --> 1:01:57.160
Right!

1:01:57.340 --> 1:01:59.140
You just needed your chance.

1:01:59.910 --> 1:02:00.970
Damn right!

1:02:01.150 --> 1:02:02.810
We've an assignment for you.

1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:04.540
Anything, Brother Sum!

1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:26.390
"Research on abnormal people."
What's that?

1:02:26.570 --> 1:02:28.370
A mental asylum.

1:02:34.110 --> 1:02:35.340
Soldiers!

1:02:35.510 --> 1:02:37.240
Boy Scouts!

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:38.400
Tanks!

1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:40.550
No worries.

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:44.350
When the Boy Scouts change shifts,
you have exactly five minutes.

1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:48.460
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell...

1:02:48.630 --> 1:02:53.290
...and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:00.690
What about you guys?

1:03:00.870 --> 1:03:02.860
We're your lookouts.

1:03:14.220 --> 1:03:16.210
Five minutes. Hurry!

1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:35.360
The world's top killer
indeed looks the part!

1:05:36.390 --> 1:05:38.730
It's only a title.

1:05:38.900 --> 1:05:42.350
Cut the bullshit. We want two people
killed. Name your price.

1:05:42.900 --> 1:05:44.420
Name my what?

1:05:46.800 --> 1:05:52.070
I've killed so many trying to find
a worthy adversary.

1:05:52.410 --> 1:05:55.710
So far, I've never found one.

1:05:56.050 --> 1:05:57.880
That's why I stayed inside.

1:05:58.050 --> 1:06:02.450
Had I met my match,
I'd have been out long ago.

1:06:02.620 --> 1:06:05.090
If you find me a worthy opponent...

1:06:05.260 --> 1:06:07.550
...I'll do it for free. No charge!

1:06:09.730 --> 1:06:10.890
Do you have someone?

1:06:11.060 --> 1:06:16.300
Yes. Brilliant fighters who are
up to the challenge.

1:06:16.470 --> 1:06:18.800
But first, will you show us
some moves?

1:06:18.970 --> 1:06:22.030
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.

1:06:22.410 --> 1:06:26.670
You numskulls aren't worthy!

1:06:31.180 --> 1:06:32.840
He doesn't look the part.

1:06:33.750 --> 1:06:38.950
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.

1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:41.020
You sure you got the right guy?

1:06:41.190 --> 1:06:44.530
Absolutely. I swear I did
exactly what you told me.

1:06:45.830 --> 1:06:49.790
Please show us some moves,
Mr. Beast. Don't make it hard for me!

1:06:49.970 --> 1:06:51.590
You dumb or what?

1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:54.430
You know what this is, old man?

1:06:54.870 --> 1:06:57.310
Ever seen a fist this big?

1:06:57.480 --> 1:07:00.600
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!

1:07:00.780 --> 1:07:02.710
Really? Try me, then.

1:07:06.550 --> 1:07:08.710
Is he okay?

1:07:14.490 --> 1:07:17.050
So you say you can fight?

1:07:18.460 --> 1:07:19.450
Harder!

1:07:20.330 --> 1:07:21.320
Harder!

1:07:24.570 --> 1:07:25.900
Harder!

1:07:28.810 --> 1:07:32.300
You hit like that and call yourself
a gangster?

1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:38.580
A foreign gun!

1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:09.580
In the world of kung fu,
speed defines the winner.

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:16.590
The Beast is the best of them all.

1:08:16.850 --> 1:08:20.520
The Axe Gang extends its respect!

1:09:02.300 --> 1:09:05.170
The real masters,
together in one room!

1:09:06.270 --> 1:09:10.470
Only the world's top killer...

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:12.840
...has such an aura.

1:09:13.580 --> 1:09:14.810
Likewise.

1:09:15.410 --> 1:09:18.070
Could you two be the fated lovers...?

1:09:18.250 --> 1:09:19.240
Paris...

1:09:19.420 --> 1:09:20.510
...and Helen of Troy!

1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:22.980
A pleasure, indeed.

1:09:23.250 --> 1:09:27.090
We're here to deal
with the Axe Gang...

1:09:27.260 --> 1:09:28.990
...and only the Axe Gang.

1:09:30.930 --> 1:09:33.760
You should've killed me before.

1:09:34.100 --> 1:09:38.540
Now you're committing suicide.

1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:42.040
You're living on borrowed time.

1:09:42.210 --> 1:09:45.200
You can't escape your fate!

1:09:45.940 --> 1:09:48.280
What's this? A funeral bell?

1:09:49.110 --> 1:09:52.450
With the Beast here,
let's see whose funeral it is!

1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:55.010
So you're on their side?

1:09:55.190 --> 1:09:57.350
Don't get me wrong.

1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:01.120
I only want to kill you...

1:10:01.290 --> 1:10:04.190
...or be killed by you.

1:10:06.700 --> 1:10:08.670
What do you think?

1:10:08.830 --> 1:10:14.170
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.

1:10:14.810 --> 1:10:18.140
So be it. Let's do it.

1:10:19.140 --> 1:10:20.300
Okay.

1:10:21.850 --> 1:10:22.870
Let's do it!

1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.400
Piece of cake. I can handle this.

1:10:54.850 --> 1:10:57.710
Good try, but a little off target.

1:12:17.490 --> 1:12:19.160
The Lion's Roar?

1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:01.250
Wait!

1:15:02.430 --> 1:15:07.260
I didn't know the Lion's Roar
could be done with a speaker!

1:15:07.430 --> 1:15:09.760
What a blow!

1:15:39.060 --> 1:15:42.400
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.

1:15:42.570 --> 1:15:43.560
You do it!

1:15:43.730 --> 1:15:46.730
- I'm gonna puke! I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!

1:15:51.170 --> 1:15:52.970
You! Come over here.

1:15:53.980 --> 1:15:56.140
- Hit him!
- Yes!

1:16:00.580 --> 1:16:02.480
- The head!
- Of course!

1:16:02.650 --> 1:16:04.380
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:06.350
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!

1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:07.650
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

1:16:07.820 --> 1:16:09.310
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!

1:16:09.490 --> 1:16:10.760
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

1:16:10.930 --> 1:16:12.690
Beat the shit out of him!

1:16:14.770 --> 1:16:15.750
What're you doing?

1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:19.440
You want me to hit him
or beat the shit out of him?

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:21.540
You're making me very confused!

1:16:49.870 --> 1:16:52.860
Wow, that's a big fist!

1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:26.830
Why did you hit me?

1:17:55.770 --> 1:17:59.100
Where are they?

1:17:59.440 --> 1:18:01.600
How could you let them escape?

1:18:07.710 --> 1:18:11.700
No one gets away from me!

1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:27.560
Why did he save us?

1:18:27.730 --> 1:18:30.830
Young people make mistakes.

1:18:31.170 --> 1:18:34.930
But at least he finally made good.

1:18:35.510 --> 1:18:39.200
Look at him! Beaten to a pulp.

1:18:41.950 --> 1:18:45.240
Do you have any last requests?

1:19:04.530 --> 1:19:07.440
Hey, wait!

1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:11.640
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:10.020
There's no one here!

1:20:14.810 --> 1:20:17.430
CHINESE MEDICINE

1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:34.110
It's a miracle he lasted this long.

1:20:34.790 --> 1:20:37.060
The herbs should help him.

1:20:37.290 --> 1:20:41.700
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.

1:20:41.870 --> 1:20:46.200
All his bones and tendons are broken.

1:20:46.370 --> 1:20:49.300
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.

1:20:49.810 --> 1:20:51.970
It can't be possible...

1:20:52.140 --> 1:20:53.700
Unless he's...

1:21:31.050 --> 1:21:32.570
What's that smell?

1:22:06.580 --> 1:22:08.570
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.

1:22:10.050 --> 1:22:11.540
Let me handle this.

1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:27.800
This makes no sense.

1:22:39.450 --> 1:22:43.510
Who knew the Beast could clear
the chi flow...

1:22:43.690 --> 1:22:46.250
...and thus unleash
the boy's true potential?

1:22:46.460 --> 1:22:49.360
We should've guessed.

1:22:50.590 --> 1:22:53.990
He is the one!

1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:06.380
Is this for real?

1:23:06.540 --> 1:23:09.100
You're still alive, you turncoat?

1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:11.680
Kill him, men!

1:24:06.540 --> 1:24:08.000
What kind of move is that?

1:24:08.340 --> 1:24:10.860
Kids' stuff!

1:24:38.770 --> 1:24:42.360
If our son were alive,
he'd be his age now.

1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:47.880
If he studies hard, he could grow up
to be a doctor or lawyer.

1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:50.880
A stuntman, more likely!

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:55.600
Not bad. Let's go.

1:26:38.660 --> 1:26:40.710
I can even stop bullets...

1:27:51.090 --> 1:27:54.460
What? The Toad Style
of the Kwan Lun School?

1:27:54.630 --> 1:27:55.830
Oh, no!

1:29:51.410 --> 1:29:55.350
Remember the Palm move
that falls from heaven?

1:29:55.520 --> 1:29:58.680
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:44.330
I surrender!

1:31:45.860 --> 1:31:47.300
What kind of move was that?

1:31:49.070 --> 1:31:51.230
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.

1:32:02.980 --> 1:32:04.310
Master!

1:33:18.150 --> 1:33:21.990
Hey! Tell him not to put snot
on the glass.

1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:24.750
You two, put your pants on!

1:33:24.930 --> 1:33:27.590
No licking if you're not buying!

1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:38.560
Kid, you have the bone structure
of a kung-fu genius.

1:34:38.730 --> 1:34:42.530
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.

1:34:42.710 --> 1:34:45.300
Because it's fate, I'll let you
have it for $ 10.

1:34:45.470 --> 1:34:46.530
Wait!

1:34:46.980 --> 1:34:49.380
You want more...?
