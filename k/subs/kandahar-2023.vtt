WEBVTT

04:12.043 --> 04:14.337
Show me what you did!

04:19.342 --> 04:22.762
Show me what you did!

04:22.762 --> 04:26.975
We're almost done here.
Almost done.!

04:26.975 --> 04:28.768
He needs to show us,

04:28.768 --> 04:30.729
what was doing.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.653
The internet...

04:38.653 --> 04:39.988
better connectivity

04:39.988 --> 04:42.115
for the city of Qom.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.912
A pig!

04:54.169 --> 04:58.048
We call Quds Force.

04:59.925 --> 05:03.512
We were hired by your Government.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.113
All clear...

06:49.326 --> 06:51.828
All clear...

13:41.070 --> 13:42.947
Next.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.909
Passport?

13:55.293 --> 13:59.172
Place your fingers on there.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.891
What is your business in the
Islamic Emirate?

14:09.891 --> 14:12.977
I'm working with the
Red Crescent...

14:12.977 --> 14:16.105
Drought relief.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.503
Do not take pictures.
You are to obey Sharia law

18:21.726 --> 18:25.771
Luckily most of the radiation...
is trapped underground.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.440
The Supreme Leader

18:27.440 --> 18:29.442
thinks we look weak.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.653
Especially after Natanz.

18:32.653 --> 18:36.532
He wants a public execution for
the person responsible.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.619
Only the Americans or
Israelis, have this capability-

18:40.619 --> 18:43.039
Yes, the problem is
proving it.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.759
We're monitoring a journalist...

18:54.759 --> 18:58.512
She received classified files,

18:58.512 --> 19:01.807
on all CIA operations
in the Middle East.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.604
Do whatever it

19:06.604 --> 19:08.481
takes Farzad.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.691
And do it quick.

20:22.054 --> 20:26.976
The Northern Alliance conducted
raids in Sherberghan.

20:26.976 --> 20:30.729
They're massing a small force
outside of Kunduz.

20:30.729 --> 20:35.109
We need more ammunition for
the M4's and rockets -

20:47.246 --> 20:50.291
I want to talk about the killings...

20:50.291 --> 20:52.042
in Herat, the teachers.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.420
Reeducating the population...

20:54.420 --> 20:56.630
...in the old ways.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.092
Set forth by
Mullah Omar-

22:08.577 --> 22:12.748
You've been given a gift
from God.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.418
You've slayed...
the American dragon.

22:16.418 --> 22:21.173
Now you must focus on reuniting
your People.

22:21.173 --> 22:26.428
So the Caliphate... like a seed
in the wind can spread.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.556
Very good.

22:55.374 --> 22:55.916
PAKISTAN

22:55.916 --> 22:57.668
How did the meeting go?

22:57.668 --> 23:00.129
Sir, they've all gone mad.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.256
Times have changed...

23:02.256 --> 23:05.092
and these guys are still living
in the past.

23:05.092 --> 23:08.596
As long as they keep their backs
to India.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.141
Did you see the news?

23:12.141 --> 23:16.103
Someone burned
down Iran's crown jewel.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.857
Be ready...
your country may need you.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.275
Yes, sir.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.229
Nahal dear,
it's good to see you.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.358
It's so good to see you.

37:15.358 --> 37:18.903
How's your family?
How's my Adela?

37:18.903 --> 37:20.613
They are fine.

37:20.613 --> 37:23.158
We're living outside of Baltimore.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.909
Why are you here?

37:24.909 --> 37:26.578
The Taliban are still
searching for us.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.164
Adela's sister Fatemah
went missing.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.833
I promised Adela I'd find her.

37:31.833 --> 37:34.919
She was teaching in Herat.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.547
I don't know what happened
to Fatemah.

37:37.547 --> 37:41.092
I only know that the female
teachers disappeared.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.971
There was never going to be a
place for us

37:44.971 --> 37:48.141
with the Taliban.

37:48.141 --> 37:53.938
Not as Judges, Teachers,
Translators or Doctors.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.399
I'll send a word, if I
hear anything about Fatemah.

37:56.399 --> 37:59.194
Thank you.

38:01.738 --> 38:07.327
Come with me...
There's a flight out.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.205
I can't leave.

38:10.205 --> 38:13.249
Too much was gained.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.585
We lost our freedom.

38:15.585 --> 38:17.962
We can't do it again.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.047
I'm sorry.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.287
Hello my dear son.

39:01.130 --> 39:04.968
Dear son,

39:04.968 --> 39:09.597
you are always in our hearts.

39:13.309 --> 39:17.105
I miss you so much.

39:28.825 --> 39:34.372
I wish I had died
and you were alive.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.205
Der Herold's editor-in-chief

40:16.205 --> 40:17.206
Hans Forsberg...

40:17.206 --> 40:21.794
...said he felt compelled to
make sure

40:21.794 --> 40:26.007
Cujai's efforts were not in vain.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.217
Hence, the
releasing of her report.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.084
Get in quick.

41:45.586 --> 41:48.089
My scout got me this.

42:00.017 --> 42:03.688
We found where he is... Herat.

42:03.688 --> 42:06.357
Put together an action team.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.358
I want to deliver him to the

42:07.358 --> 42:08.234
Supreme Leader...

42:08.234 --> 42:09.235
Before sundown.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.195
Yes sir.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.866
Get me on the phone to

42:14.866 --> 42:16.075
Agent Nazir.

42:31.007 --> 42:33.509
I need you in Herat.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.261
What's so
special about Herat?

42:35.261 --> 42:40.892
The spy who sabotaged the Iranians.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.478
Sir, I was spending my two days
of holiday -

42:43.478 --> 42:46.022
Leave now.

42:56.324 --> 42:58.242
I want you to capture him,

42:58.242 --> 43:02.705
before the Iranians.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.875
We'll sell him on the
open market.

44:52.899 --> 44:55.568
Let's grab him quick
and get back home.

44:55.568 --> 44:57.361
The Taliban are looking for any excuse

44:57.361 --> 45:00.156
to blame us for their failures.

45:00.156 --> 45:03.492
Avoid civilian casualties
at all costs.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.119
Understand?

46:01.926 --> 46:04.095
The honorable Kahil.

46:13.813 --> 46:16.899
I know who you want...

46:16.899 --> 46:18.484
But the Iranians have already paid,

46:18.484 --> 46:21.445
to cross the border.

46:21.445 --> 46:23.656
He's their target now.

46:23.656 --> 46:27.910
I'll double whatever they
paid you.

46:27.910 --> 46:30.037
I don't want money.

46:30.037 --> 46:32.581
Make me the head of
the military council.

46:32.581 --> 46:34.959
My Pakistani brother.

47:37.730 --> 47:38.856
We're green.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.357
Go.

48:24.860 --> 48:27.154
They're in the market.

50:03.459 --> 50:04.919
They changed vehicles!

50:04.919 --> 50:06.795
Nissan truck.

50:08.088 --> 50:10.007
Don't lose him.

50:16.305 --> 50:18.849
Still can't find them.

50:20.017 --> 50:23.187
Search the entire city.

51:03.143 --> 51:06.230
Stay here, in case he tries
to escape.

51:19.952 --> 51:22.079
We've got company,
black motorcycle.

51:28.669 --> 51:30.838
We see him.

51:52.109 --> 51:55.446
Oh my God, you idiot!

51:57.156 --> 51:58.324
What the hell?

51:58.324 --> 52:01.869
Look what you did to my car.

52:01.869 --> 52:04.079
May your house fall down.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.047
Police!

52:41.367 --> 52:44.078
Hurry! Block him!
Block his way, hurry!

53:12.314 --> 53:13.649
Get out!

53:41.051 --> 53:42.386
They're in a Nissan pickup.

53:42.386 --> 53:44.638
Find them!

53:44.638 --> 53:46.348
We have our scouts
searching now.

54:51.747 --> 54:52.623
They got away...

54:52.623 --> 54:54.958
heading east from
the warehouse area.

59:19.264 --> 59:22.225
He went that way!

59:37.616 --> 59:41.077
Going to visit an old friend
in Delaram...

59:57.886 --> 01:00:02.474
Going to visit an old friend
in Delaram...

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.033
Iranian pigs go home!

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.245
Traitors!

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:27.082
The Taliban are letting us take
the body back to Tehran.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.506
Hi, my love.

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:36.007
When will you be
coming home?

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:38.635
I want to make us dinner.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.679
I'm going to be late.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.266
Is everything alright?

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:49.646
I'll be back as
soon as I can.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:52.190
Give Camila a kiss from Baba.

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:55.527
Okay.

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:58.154
Stay safe Farzad.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:21.553
Do you know who I am?

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:24.472
I.S.I.

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:26.349
What are
you doing out here?

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.351
Protecting the road
from Takfiris,

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:31.646
non-believers and enemies
of the Taliban.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:33.106
I can build IEDS,

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:37.986
fire rifles, AKs, M4s
and Sig Sauers.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.703
Have you read the Quran
for yourself?

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.082
No right?

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:52.792
Then how can you know
what it means,

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:56.755
to be a true believer?

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:59.633
You might find it to be very different...

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:03.553
from what they're telling you
it says.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:11.811
Hey little one...

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:15.106
have you seen this man?

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:17.275
Do you know where he was going?

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:20.779
Toward Delaram.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:27.077
Thank you.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.013
Take the shot!

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:09.531
We're taking fire.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.490
Fire another shot!

01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:03.835
He's hit!

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:07.440
Land!

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.828
Split up... Flank their position.

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:02.787
Copy.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:03.955
Copy.

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.130
There!

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.383
Kill him.

01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:34.725
Are you ready...
to fight for Allah?

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:04.104
No, thank you.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:19.328
It must feel...
strange for you.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:20.746
Like a lion tamer,

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:23.790
entering the cage,
without his whip.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:26.543
Neither American, nor Afghan.

01:23:26.543 --> 01:23:29.213
You have no place.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:33.967
I know who you really are.

01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:35.510
Me?

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.347
Enlighten me.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:40.224
You are a traitor.

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:22.057
Your son?

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.399
I am... truly sorry.

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:33.443
You want revenge?

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:18.882
God might not
forgive your sins...

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:26.890
...but I do.

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:35.315
But I do.

01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:21.445
For you.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:04.005
Our target is heading
to Kandahar.

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:07.634
His flight is leaving
in six hours.

01:29:07.634 --> 01:29:13.598
He is traveling
in an old ANA truck.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:15.517
I will catch
this spy for you.

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:17.978
Good.

01:29:17.978 --> 01:29:20.480
But after that
I want a transfer.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.066
I am sick of the desert...

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:25.986
This place
is like a rotting corpse.

01:29:25.986 --> 01:29:28.530
Then where would you
like to go Kahil?

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:36.079
I don't know

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:39.291
Okay I promise...
that you will get all the

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:42.127
western "culture" you want.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:45.547
Only if you get
this job done for me.

01:29:52.846 --> 01:29:56.141
Rasoul, it is me.

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:50.088
The Paks can have your friend.

01:31:50.088 --> 01:31:52.924
Or the Iranians.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:54.759
I don't care about him.

01:31:57.178 --> 01:32:00.181
But you
will never leave here.

01:32:01.057 --> 01:32:04.018
Traitor.

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:08.064
You must pay for your sins.

01:32:08.064 --> 01:32:10.233
Rasoul.

01:32:10.233 --> 01:32:12.444
ISIS is attacking us!

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:26.040
Go! Go!

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:07.957
Go there, go!

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.478
ISIS fighters
are attacking us!

01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:30.021
ISIS are you sure?

01:33:30.021 --> 01:33:32.190
They have heavy weapons!

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.027
You hear me!

01:33:38.655 --> 01:33:40.907
I'm coming for the target.

01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:48.915
Pakistani asshole!

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:22.884
They broke through the gate!

01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:25.595
Everyone to the gate!

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.722
That's not ISIS.

01:36:50.722 --> 01:36:51.764
What?

01:36:51.764 --> 01:36:54.308
They're Afghan Commandos.

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:27.216
We'll cut them off
at Maiwand.

01:37:27.216 --> 01:37:29.010
An old CIA base
is near there.

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:31.179
The Brits have
an inbound plane.

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:32.263
This is Agent Nazir.

01:37:32.263 --> 01:37:35.433
All Taliban Red
unit and Badri 313...

01:37:35.433 --> 01:37:40.229
Prepare to stage in Maiwand.

01:38:20.269 --> 01:38:22.271
Stay close.

01:40:29.982 --> 01:40:31.734
Get the bike ready.

01:40:55.299 --> 01:41:00.972
There is no God...
except Allah.

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:09.814
And... Muhammad is...

01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:15.903
...The messenger of Allah.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:19.865
The Gentle...

01:41:21.534 --> 01:41:26.664
The Merciful... The Kind...

01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:37.675
This is Agent Nazir.

01:41:37.675 --> 01:41:39.593
Mortar team on my signal.

01:41:54.525 --> 01:41:56.736
Fire at the Land Cruiser!

01:41:56.736 --> 01:41:58.863
Now! Now!

01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:17.274
Don't let them
enter the base.

01:43:49.223 --> 01:43:50.599
Stop all fire.

01:43:50.599 --> 01:43:53.436
All Taliban forces
hold your position.

01:43:59.692 --> 01:44:03.404
The traget is mine.
I'm going in.
