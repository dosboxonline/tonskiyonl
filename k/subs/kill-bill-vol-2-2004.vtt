00:15.250 --> 00:17.543
Do you find me sadistic?

00:18.878 --> 00:21.338
You know, Kiddo...

00:21.422 --> 00:23.882
...I'd like to believe...

00:23.967 --> 00:26.593
...you're aware enough, even now...

00:27.595 --> 00:31.306
...to know that there's nothing sadistic...

00:31.391 --> 00:33.267
...in my actions.

00:34.811 --> 00:37.146
At this moment...

00:38.565 --> 00:40.232
...this is me...

00:41.234 --> 00:43.944
...at my most masochistic.

00:44.028 --> 00:45.362
Bill.

00:46.197 --> 00:47.990
It's your ba...

00:52.954 --> 00:54.955
Looked dead, didn't I?

00:55.039 --> 00:56.623
Well, I wasn't.

00:56.708 --> 01:00.294
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

01:00.378 --> 01:03.505
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

01:03.590 --> 01:06.884
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

01:07.635 --> 01:11.972
When I woke up, I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

01:12.056 --> 01:15.601
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

01:15.685 --> 01:18.729
I roared, and I rampaged,

01:18.813 --> 01:21.481
and I got bloody satisfaction.

01:22.483 --> 01:26.361
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

01:26.446 --> 01:28.655
but I've only one more.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.742
The last one.

01:31.826 --> 01:34.411
The one I'm driving to right now.

01:35.413 --> 01:38.207
The only one left.

01:38.291 --> 01:41.919
And when I arrive at my destination,

01:42.003 --> 01:45.380
I am gonna kill Bill.

02:10.657 --> 02:13.992
The incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

02:14.077 --> 02:17.246
that put this whole gory story into motion

02:17.330 --> 02:19.831
has since become legend.

02:19.916 --> 02:22.834
"Massacre at Two Pines."

02:22.919 --> 02:24.711
That's what the newspapers called it.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.463
The local TV news called it,

02:26.547 --> 02:30.801
"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre."

02:30.885 --> 02:33.595
How it happened, who was there,

02:33.680 --> 02:36.473
how many got killed
and who killed them -

02:36.557 --> 02:40.269
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

02:40.353 --> 02:44.815
In actual fact, the massacre didn't
happen during a wedding at all.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.068
It was a wedding rehearsal.

02:48.152 --> 02:50.946
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

02:51.030 --> 02:54.574
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

02:54.659 --> 02:57.619
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

02:59.622 --> 03:01.832
This might be funny to your friends,

03:01.916 --> 03:05.210
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.923
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

03:11.092 --> 03:13.093
Y'all got a song?

03:16.514 --> 03:19.766
How about "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.893
- Sure.
- Yeah.

03:21.978 --> 03:24.313
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

03:24.397 --> 03:26.523
Rufus - he's the man.

03:27.525 --> 03:30.652
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

03:30.737 --> 03:32.571
Rufus Thomas.

03:32.655 --> 03:35.574
Rufus Thomas.

03:35.658 --> 03:40.078
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

03:40.163 --> 03:43.707
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Barkay.

03:43.791 --> 03:47.127
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

03:48.171 --> 03:51.965
Rufus - he's the man.

03:54.552 --> 03:56.720
- Have I forgotten anything?
- Um...

03:56.804 --> 04:00.390
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

04:00.475 --> 04:02.142
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

04:03.227 --> 04:05.395
Now, the way we normally do this -

04:05.480 --> 04:09.566
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.861
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

04:12.945 --> 04:16.990
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

04:17.075 --> 04:19.451
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.163
Right...

04:23.247 --> 04:26.291
Well, I don't see no problem with...

04:26.376 --> 04:29.669
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

04:29.754 --> 04:32.589
- Do you, Mother?
- I don't have a problem with that.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.673
But, uh...

04:33.758 --> 04:38.095
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.264
You know, as a sign of good faith?

04:42.850 --> 04:44.976
Well, I don't have anybody...

04:45.061 --> 04:49.147
...except for Tommy and my friends.

04:49.232 --> 04:53.443
- You have no family?
- Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

04:53.528 --> 04:57.823
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

04:59.450 --> 05:03.620
I'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

05:03.704 --> 05:07.290
So while y'all blather on,
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

05:08.292 --> 05:10.460
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

05:10.545 --> 05:13.964
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

05:14.048 --> 05:16.883
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.343
Right...

06:36.422 --> 06:37.881
Hello, Kiddo.

06:43.137 --> 06:47.724
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

06:51.395 --> 06:53.605
What are you doin' here?

06:54.607 --> 06:56.816
What am I doin'?

06:58.319 --> 07:00.445
Well...

07:00.530 --> 07:03.990
...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

07:09.747 --> 07:11.998
At this moment...

07:13.000 --> 07:17.587
...I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

07:19.173 --> 07:23.009
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

07:25.346 --> 07:29.683
- Are you gonna be nice?
- I've never been nice in my whole life.

07:31.310 --> 07:34.688
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

07:34.772 --> 07:35.772
Hmm.

07:36.941 --> 07:39.276
I always told you...

07:39.360 --> 07:42.737
...your sweet side is you best side.

07:42.822 --> 07:47.701
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

07:49.787 --> 07:53.999
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

07:55.376 --> 07:58.753
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

07:59.880 --> 08:05.427
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

08:05.511 --> 08:08.054
Have you seen Tommy?

08:10.141 --> 08:13.393
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

08:13.477 --> 08:15.520
Then I saw him.

08:16.689 --> 08:18.940
I like his hair.

08:19.942 --> 08:22.485
You promised you'd be nice.

08:24.405 --> 08:29.117
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

08:29.201 --> 08:31.453
But you're right.

08:31.537 --> 08:34.998
What does your young man
do for a living?

08:36.417 --> 08:39.336
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

08:39.419 --> 08:43.965
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

08:45.259 --> 08:47.302
Aren't we all?

08:51.098 --> 08:55.101
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

08:56.604 --> 08:59.522
I work in the record store.

08:59.607 --> 09:02.067
Aso.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.196
It all suddenly seems so clear.

09:08.658 --> 09:13.286
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

09:14.330 --> 09:16.873
I get to listen to music all day...

09:16.957 --> 09:20.585
...talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

09:21.671 --> 09:25.465
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

09:28.302 --> 09:32.889
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

09:32.973 --> 09:35.684
and being paid vast sums of money?

09:37.812 --> 09:39.354
Precisely.

09:39.438 --> 09:42.273
Well, my old friend...

09:42.358 --> 09:44.734
...to each his own.

09:44.819 --> 09:49.364
However, all cockblockery aside...

09:49.448 --> 09:52.909
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

09:52.993 --> 09:58.373
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

10:00.668 --> 10:04.629
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.842
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

10:08.926 --> 10:12.345
Your side always was a bit lonely.

10:12.430 --> 10:15.265
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

10:17.727 --> 10:19.894
You know...

10:19.979 --> 10:22.439
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

10:22.523 --> 10:24.899
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

10:25.651 --> 10:27.152
- You must be Tommy!
- Uh-huh.

10:27.236 --> 10:29.446
Arlene's told me so much about you.

10:29.530 --> 10:32.574
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.

10:32.658 --> 10:35.201
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

10:36.662 --> 10:38.455
Oh, my God!

10:38.539 --> 10:40.665
Oh, my God, this is great!

10:40.750 --> 10:43.334
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

10:43.419 --> 10:45.670
The name's Bill.

10:45.796 --> 10:47.589
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

10:47.673 --> 10:51.301
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

10:51.385 --> 10:54.596
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

10:54.680 --> 10:58.099
Well, in the surprise department...

10:58.184 --> 11:01.561
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

11:01.645 --> 11:03.897
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

11:03.981 --> 11:06.983
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.528
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

11:10.613 --> 11:12.989
...no one could reach you.

11:13.073 --> 11:16.493
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

11:16.577 --> 11:18.536
So...

11:18.621 --> 11:22.332
What's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

11:22.416 --> 11:26.795
but I don't believe I've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

11:26.879 --> 11:28.129
We thought,

11:28.214 --> 11:31.466
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only going to wear once?"

11:31.550 --> 11:34.469
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

11:34.553 --> 11:38.097
So, I think we're going to try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

11:39.683 --> 11:42.894
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

11:42.978 --> 11:46.105
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

11:46.732 --> 11:50.527
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.489
I know just what you mean.

11:54.573 --> 11:57.826
Son.
Some of us have places to be.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.410
Sure do.

11:59.495 --> 12:03.873
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

12:03.958 --> 12:07.877
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

12:07.962 --> 12:11.756
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

12:11.841 --> 12:14.259
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

12:14.343 --> 12:17.303
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

12:17.388 --> 12:19.514
That's asking a lot.

12:20.766 --> 12:23.852
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

12:23.936 --> 12:26.896
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

12:26.981 --> 12:29.566
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.985
Deal. We got to do this now.

12:32.069 --> 12:36.114
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

12:36.198 --> 12:39.492
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

12:42.872 --> 12:44.998
Mother, here we go!

12:46.500 --> 12:49.794
Now son, about them vows...

12:55.885 --> 12:57.218
Bill...

12:58.220 --> 13:02.932
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

13:03.017 --> 13:05.602
If he's the man you want...

13:05.686 --> 13:08.521
...then go stand by him.

13:32.129 --> 13:36.257
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

13:46.810 --> 13:48.853
Thank you.

14:23.722 --> 14:25.348
What the hell?

14:26.809 --> 14:28.768
No! Bill!

15:08.058 --> 15:14.147
You tellin' me she cut her way through
88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

15:14.231 --> 15:16.274
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

15:16.358 --> 15:19.110
They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88"

15:19.194 --> 15:21.237
- How come?
- I don't know.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.365
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

15:24.450 --> 15:28.286
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

15:28.370 --> 15:32.373
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

15:32.458 --> 15:35.877
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

15:35.961 --> 15:39.547
It would appear he has broken it.

15:41.759 --> 15:45.511
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

15:47.848 --> 15:49.599
Or maybe...

15:49.683 --> 15:53.519
...you just tend
to bring that out in people.

15:53.604 --> 15:57.774
I know this is a ridiculous question
before I ask it,

15:57.858 --> 16:02.320
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

16:04.907 --> 16:06.240
I, um...

16:07.242 --> 16:10.703
I pawned that years ago.

16:10.788 --> 16:14.123
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

16:14.792 --> 16:16.250
Yep.

16:16.335 --> 16:18.336
It was priceless.

16:22.758 --> 16:26.260
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

16:27.262 --> 16:30.389
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

16:32.017 --> 16:34.936
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

16:37.648 --> 16:40.942
If she wants to fight with me, all she's
got to do is come to the club

16:41.026 --> 16:43.861
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

16:45.489 --> 16:49.283
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

16:50.369 --> 16:54.163
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

16:54.248 --> 16:58.668
but you've got to get over
being mad at me,

16:58.752 --> 17:00.920
and start becoming afraid of,

17:01.004 --> 17:04.589
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

17:05.925 --> 17:10.221
And unless you accept my assistance,
I have no doubt she will succeed.

17:19.147 --> 17:24.068
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew
out of paying my comeuppance.

17:26.195 --> 17:29.740
Can't we just... forget the past?

17:32.536 --> 17:34.495
That woman...

17:34.580 --> 17:36.789
...deserves her revenge.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.212
And...

17:44.089 --> 17:45.882
...we deserve to die.

17:50.888 --> 17:53.598
But then again...

17:53.682 --> 17:55.683
...so does she.

17:59.104 --> 18:00.813
So I guess...

18:01.815 --> 18:03.900
...we'll just see.

18:05.319 --> 18:07.320
Won't we?

18:43.732 --> 18:45.608
Late again.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.860
Budd, can't you tell time?

18:48.904 --> 18:50.863
There ain't nobody in here, man.

18:50.948 --> 18:53.157
- Is that Budd?
- Yeah.

18:53.242 --> 18:56.160
Tell him to get
his fucking ass back here!

18:56.245 --> 18:58.037
OK.

18:58.121 --> 19:01.707
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

19:06.421 --> 19:09.465
Take a hit.
Be somebody, baby.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.559
You looking for me?

19:26.566 --> 19:30.278
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

19:30.362 --> 19:33.781
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,
but it wasn't owned by me

19:33.865 --> 19:36.492
- and I own a fuckin' car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.911
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

19:38.996 --> 19:40.913
Larry...

19:41.873 --> 19:45.001
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

19:45.085 --> 19:49.088
"There's nobody
out there, Larry."

19:50.549 --> 19:52.591
What's your point?

19:52.676 --> 19:57.388
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

19:57.472 --> 20:02.018
...I'm the bouncer, and there
ain't nobody out there to bounce.

20:02.102 --> 20:05.396
You're saying that the reason...

20:05.480 --> 20:09.483
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

20:09.568 --> 20:14.030
...paying you to do is that
you don't have a job to do?

20:16.158 --> 20:18.409
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

20:18.493 --> 20:20.536
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

20:20.620 --> 20:23.581
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.959
Well, guess what, buddy.

20:27.044 --> 20:30.671
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

20:32.424 --> 20:34.508
Let's go to the calendar.

20:34.593 --> 20:36.761
It's calendar time.

20:36.845 --> 20:39.388
Calendar time for Buddy.

20:39.473 --> 20:42.933
- OK. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

20:43.018 --> 20:47.104
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

20:47.189 --> 20:49.190
Here. You're not working tomorrow.

20:49.274 --> 20:52.443
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

20:52.527 --> 20:54.612
- Workin' Thursday?
- Yeah.

20:54.696 --> 20:58.866
I don't think so.
Friday.

20:58.950 --> 21:01.202
I d... There's your name.

21:01.286 --> 21:04.163
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. OK?

21:04.247 --> 21:06.957
- Saturday. There used to be your name.
- Oh.

21:07.042 --> 21:08.417
Uh, Monday...

21:09.294 --> 21:10.586
Here. How about that?

21:10.670 --> 21:15.591
Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing
you kids seem to understand. OK?

21:16.968 --> 21:19.220
Now, I want you to go home till I call you.

21:19.304 --> 21:21.722
Till I call you.

21:21.807 --> 21:25.893
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

21:27.229 --> 21:29.188
And...

21:30.190 --> 21:31.899
...the hat.

21:32.901 --> 21:34.860
That fuckin' hat.

21:34.945 --> 21:38.322
That fucking...

21:38.907 --> 21:41.742
How many times have I told you,

21:41.827 --> 21:45.913
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?

21:50.127 --> 21:51.919
Customers wear hats.

21:52.003 --> 21:54.588
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

21:54.673 --> 21:56.966
I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...

21:58.760 --> 22:02.221
...that I want you to keep
that shit-kicker hat at home.

22:37.090 --> 22:41.218
Yeah. Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

22:41.303 --> 22:44.221
There's shitty water all over the floor.

22:44.306 --> 22:48.142
OK... Rocket.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.980
- I'll clean it up.
- Mm-hmm.

24:16.439 --> 24:18.315
How many times

24:18.400 --> 24:24.154
Have you heard someone say,

24:24.239 --> 24:27.575
"If I had his money,

24:27.659 --> 24:31.662
I could do things my way"

24:31.746 --> 24:35.332
But little they know

24:35.417 --> 24:38.586
That it's so hard to find

24:39.754 --> 24:42.881
One rich man in ten

24:42.966 --> 24:46.260
With a satisfied mind

24:49.097 --> 24:52.683
Once I was wading

24:52.767 --> 24:55.603
In fortune and fame

24:56.605 --> 24:59.857
Everything that I dreamed for

24:59.941 --> 25:03.527
To get a start in life's game

25:04.487 --> 25:08.032
Then suddenly it happened

25:08.116 --> 25:12.745
I lost every dime,
but I'm richer...

25:47.322 --> 25:49.657
How many times

25:49.741 --> 25:53.827
Have you heard someone say...

26:30.573 --> 26:32.741
Now...

26:32.826 --> 26:35.285
...that gentled you down some, didn't it?

26:44.963 --> 26:46.630
Yep.

26:47.841 --> 26:53.804
Ain't nobody a badass with a double
dose of rock salt dug deep in their tits.

26:58.017 --> 27:01.437
Not havin'... tits...

27:06.192 --> 27:08.277
...as fine...

27:08.361 --> 27:10.863
...or as big as yours,

27:11.531 --> 27:15.534
I can't even imagine
how bad that shit must sting.

27:19.914 --> 27:20.914
Yet...

27:25.587 --> 27:27.838
...I don't want to, neither.

27:49.152 --> 27:51.278
I win.

28:01.831 --> 28:04.708
Ugh! Ugh.

29:03.643 --> 29:04.768
Bill.

29:05.854 --> 29:08.397
Wrong brother, ya hateful bitch.

29:08.481 --> 29:11.108
- Budd.
- Bingo.

29:12.902 --> 29:15.362
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

29:16.489 --> 29:20.325
I just caught me the cowgirl
ain't never been caught.

29:22.078 --> 29:25.789
- Did you kill her?
- Well, not yet, I ain't.

29:25.915 --> 29:28.792
I shot her full of rock salt.

29:28.877 --> 29:33.672
She's so gentle right now, I could
perform her coup de grÃ¢ce with a rock.

29:34.799 --> 29:36.508
Any who...

29:40.138 --> 29:43.390
Guess what I'm holdin'
in my hand right now?

29:43.474 --> 29:44.474
What?

29:44.559 --> 29:48.687
A brand spankin' new
Hattori Hanzo sword.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.399
And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,

29:53.401 --> 29:57.112
- ...that's what I call sharp.
- How much?

29:57.196 --> 30:01.783
Oh, that's hard to say,
bein' that it's... priceless and all.

30:01.868 --> 30:04.369
What's the terms?

30:04.454 --> 30:07.539
You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...

30:08.833 --> 30:11.543
...with a million dollars in folding cash...

30:12.962 --> 30:18.383
...and I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man.

30:22.347 --> 30:24.348
Now, how do you like the sound of that?

30:24.432 --> 30:26.058
Sounds like we got a deal.

30:26.142 --> 30:29.144
- One condition.
- What?

30:29.228 --> 30:32.856
She must suffer to her last breath.

30:32.941 --> 30:34.232
Well...

30:35.485 --> 30:37.819
That, Elle darlin'...

30:38.529 --> 30:41.448
...I can pretty much
damn well guarantee.

30:42.450 --> 30:46.244
Then I'll see you
in the mornin', millionaire.

30:46.329 --> 30:47.788
All right.

31:49.142 --> 31:50.767
Wakey, wakey.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.020
Eggs and bakey.

32:28.306 --> 32:29.890
I'm done!

32:30.767 --> 32:33.351
Get me outta this hole!

32:36.439 --> 32:37.773
Good.

32:47.492 --> 32:48.658
Whew.

33:10.598 --> 33:12.641
Whoa, look at those eyes.

33:12.725 --> 33:14.768
This bitch is furious.

33:16.896 --> 33:18.730
What did I tell ya?

33:19.732 --> 33:23.026
Is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

33:23.111 --> 33:27.322
Or... is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

33:27.406 --> 33:29.574
I seen better.

33:34.622 --> 33:37.499
You got anything to say?

33:39.127 --> 33:42.379
White women call this
"the silent treatment."

33:42.463 --> 33:44.798
And we let 'em think we don't like it.

33:50.054 --> 33:52.722
You grab the feet, I'll get the head.

33:59.981 --> 34:02.440
Hey. Hey. Hey!

34:04.068 --> 34:06.570
Wiggle worm, you see this?

34:07.864 --> 34:09.864
You see it, don't ya?

34:12.076 --> 34:13.702
That's a can of Mace.

34:13.786 --> 34:16.663
Mm-hmm. No.

34:16.746 --> 34:19.833
You're goin' underneath
the ground tonight.

34:19.917 --> 34:23.670
And... that's all there is to it.

34:27.007 --> 34:29.426
I wanna bury ya.

34:32.013 --> 34:34.889
I was gonna bury ya...

34:40.313 --> 34:41.980
...with this.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.820
But if you're gonna
act like a horse's ass...

34:51.114 --> 34:56.745
...I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn
can right in your eyeballs!

34:56.829 --> 35:00.373
I'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin' head.

35:01.042 --> 35:03.835
Then you're gonna be blind...

35:03.920 --> 35:06.338
...and burnin'...

35:08.507 --> 35:10.258
...and buried alive.

35:15.806 --> 35:17.891
Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

35:28.778 --> 35:31.279
That's a wise decision.

35:44.335 --> 35:47.337
This is for breakin' my brother's heart.

39:36.317 --> 39:39.027
Once upon a time...

39:39.111 --> 39:40.653
...in China...

39:41.947 --> 39:45.408
...some believe around the year...

39:45.493 --> 39:48.328
...one double aught-three,

39:49.497 --> 39:55.835
head priest of the White Lotus Clan,
Pai Mei, was walking down a road...

39:56.962 --> 39:59.005
...contemplating whatever it is

39:59.089 --> 40:05.011
that a man of Pai Mei's
infinite powers would contemplate -

40:05.095 --> 40:08.348
which is another way
of saying, "Who knows?" -

40:09.683 --> 40:12.810
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

40:12.895 --> 40:15.647
traveling in the opposite direction.

40:15.731 --> 40:19.150
As the monk and the priest
crossed paths...

40:20.152 --> 40:22.195
...Pai Mei...

40:22.279 --> 40:27.617
...in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

40:27.701 --> 40:30.912
gave the monk the slightest of nods.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.958
The nod...

40:35.042 --> 40:36.960
...was not returned.

40:40.589 --> 40:45.718
Now, was it the intention
of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?

40:46.845 --> 40:52.016
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

40:52.101 --> 40:56.980
The motives of the monk
remain unknown.

40:57.064 --> 40:59.148
What is known...

40:59.233 --> 41:01.150
...were the consequences.

41:14.039 --> 41:19.002
The next morning, Pai Mei
appeared at the Shaolin temple...

41:20.212 --> 41:23.381
...and demanded
of the temple's head abbot

41:23.465 --> 41:28.970
that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

41:30.222 --> 41:34.642
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei.

41:34.727 --> 41:37.729
Only to find Pai Mei was...

41:38.731 --> 41:40.440
...inconsolable.

41:51.744 --> 41:53.620
So began...

41:53.704 --> 41:59.959
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

42:00.044 --> 42:02.128
at the fists of the White Lotus.

42:03.756 --> 42:07.258
And... so began the legend...

42:07.343 --> 42:12.013
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

42:12.097 --> 42:14.307
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

42:14.391 --> 42:17.018
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

42:17.102 --> 42:21.272
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

42:23.651 --> 42:27.028
He hits you with his fingertips...

42:27.112 --> 42:31.074
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

42:31.158 --> 42:34.077
...and then lets you walk away.

42:35.245 --> 42:38.206
But once you've taken five steps...

42:38.290 --> 42:42.293
...your heart explodes inside your body...

42:42.378 --> 42:45.546
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

42:45.631 --> 42:48.758
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

42:50.636 --> 42:55.056
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

42:55.724 --> 42:57.767
Now...

42:57.851 --> 43:01.521
...one of the things
I've always liked about you...

43:01.605 --> 43:03.106
...Kiddo...

43:04.817 --> 43:07.694
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

43:11.699 --> 43:15.451
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

43:16.453 --> 43:17.912
Whatever...

43:17.996 --> 43:22.500
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

43:23.502 --> 43:28.631
If you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

43:28.716 --> 43:33.928
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

43:34.012 --> 43:37.265
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

43:40.644 --> 43:43.521
And that will be the story of you.

44:03.751 --> 44:06.294
He'll accept you as his student.

44:06.378 --> 44:08.463
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

44:08.547 --> 44:11.382
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

44:11.467 --> 44:13.134
Why did he accept me?

44:13.218 --> 44:17.513
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

44:17.598 --> 44:19.807
And like all rotten bastards...

44:20.809 --> 44:24.479
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

44:26.148 --> 44:29.025
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

44:29.109 --> 44:32.695
but it does teach them
the value of company.

44:34.448 --> 44:36.532
Whew. Oh.

44:36.617 --> 44:40.912
Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

44:41.872 --> 44:43.372
You're gonna have a lot of fun

44:43.457 --> 44:46.959
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

44:51.924 --> 44:53.883
When will I see you again?

44:53.967 --> 44:57.386
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

44:57.471 --> 44:59.472
- What?
- Nothin'.

45:00.307 --> 45:02.850
When he tells me you're done.

45:02.935 --> 45:04.727
When do you think that might be?

45:04.812 --> 45:07.730
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

45:07.815 --> 45:11.317
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

45:11.401 --> 45:13.736
At least not for the first year or so.

45:13.862 --> 45:17.073
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

45:17.157 --> 45:20.743
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

45:20.828 --> 45:23.871
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

45:26.250 --> 45:29.627
So, in your case...
it might take a little while.

45:30.462 --> 45:33.297
- AdiÃ³s.
-

47:12.814 --> 47:13.940
Master...

47:15.776 --> 47:17.485
Your Mandarin is lousy.

47:18.445 --> 47:19.779
It causes my ears discomfort.

47:19.863 --> 47:21.489
You bray like an ass!

47:22.282 --> 47:24.408
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

47:25.327 --> 47:28.871
Is it too much to hope --
you understand Cantonese?

47:32.668 --> 47:34.043
I speak Japanese very well--

47:34.127 --> 47:37.421
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese --

47:37.506 --> 47:39.632
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

47:41.009 --> 47:42.176
A little.

47:42.844 --> 47:47.473
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

47:47.849 --> 47:49.558
If you can't understand me --

47:49.643 --> 47:51.519
I will communicate with you
like I would a dog.

47:51.853 --> 47:55.356
When I yell, when I point,
when I beat you with my stick!

48:01.405 --> 48:03.280
Bill is your master, is he not?

48:05.033 --> 48:06.701
Yes, he is.

48:09.037 --> 48:12.832
Your master tells me --
you're not entirely unschooled.

48:13.750 --> 48:15.209
What training do you possess?

48:15.919 --> 48:18.295
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

48:18.380 --> 48:22.675
and I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

48:23.927 --> 48:26.929
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

48:27.014 --> 48:31.684
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for --

48:32.060 --> 48:33.644
Japanese fat heads!

48:38.775 --> 48:43.904
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

48:44.448 --> 48:45.072
No.

48:45.907 --> 48:47.867
Are you aware I kill at will?

48:48.535 --> 48:49.577
Yes.

48:50.078 --> 48:51.454
Is it your wish to die?

48:51.538 --> 48:52.413
No.

48:54.416 --> 48:55.332
Then you must be stupid...

48:55.417 --> 48:57.793
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

48:57.878 --> 49:01.589
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

49:02.090 --> 49:03.257
Rise.

49:07.804 --> 49:13.434
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

49:14.269 --> 49:16.228
What's the matter?

49:16.646 --> 49:18.606
Cat got your tongue?

49:20.067 --> 49:23.027
-- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

49:23.653 --> 49:25.112
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

49:28.116 --> 49:29.867
Go to that rack.

49:38.168 --> 49:39.126
Remove the sword.

50:05.487 --> 50:07.279
Let's see how good you really are.

50:08.156 --> 50:09.782
If...

50:10.450 --> 50:12.159
...you land a single blow,

50:13.870 --> 50:15.621
I'll bow down and call you master.

50:29.845 --> 50:32.346
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

50:37.519 --> 50:40.980
Your swordsmanship --
is amateur at best.

50:54.995 --> 51:00.332
Your so-called kung-fu -- is really --
quite pathetic.

51:03.170 --> 51:06.964
I asked you to demonstrate --
what you know -- and you did...

51:07.674 --> 51:08.883
Not a goddamn thing!

51:09.926 --> 51:13.554
Let's see your Tiger Crane --
match my Eagle's Claw.

52:10.737 --> 52:12.696
Like all Yankee women...

52:12.781 --> 52:16.283
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

52:17.410 --> 52:19.036
Excruciating -- isn't it?

52:19.120 --> 52:20.371
Yes!

52:21.957 --> 52:23.290
If it was my wish...

52:23.792 --> 52:25.084
...I could chop your arm off.

52:25.168 --> 52:26.460
No, please don't!

52:27.921 --> 52:30.214
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

52:30.840 --> 52:32.925
If you can stop me -- I suggest you try.

52:35.303 --> 52:36.303
I can't.

52:37.472 --> 52:38.722
Because you're helpless?

52:39.599 --> 52:40.474
Yes.

52:43.144 --> 52:45.229
Have you ever felt this before?

52:45.647 --> 52:46.438
No.

52:46.690 --> 52:50.109
Compared to me -- you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

52:51.111 --> 52:52.319
YES!

52:54.489 --> 52:55.239
THAT'S THE BEGINNING!

53:00.996 --> 53:03.664
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

53:06.084 --> 53:07.084
Yes!

53:09.504 --> 53:12.298
Your training will begin -- tomorrow.

53:21.057 --> 53:22.433
Since your arm now belongs to me...

53:23.351 --> 53:24.643
...I want it strong.

53:26.187 --> 53:27.604
Can you do that?

53:29.316 --> 53:30.983
I can, but not that close.

53:31.151 --> 53:32.443
Then you can't do it.

53:33.695 --> 53:37.448
What if your enemy --
is three inches in front of you...

53:38.533 --> 53:39.783
...What do you do then...

53:40.910 --> 53:42.036
...Curl into a ball...

53:43.705 --> 53:44.955
...or do you put your FIST through him?

53:46.541 --> 53:47.291
Now begin.

54:19.532 --> 54:21.909
It's the wood that should
fear your hand --

54:21.993 --> 54:23.577
-- not the other way around.

54:24.412 --> 54:28.707
No wonder you can't do it --
you acquiesce to defeat --

54:28.792 --> 54:30.167
-- before you even begin.

56:18.651 --> 56:20.861
If you want to eat like a dog...

56:22.155 --> 56:24.156
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

56:26.659 --> 56:28.535
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

56:30.163 --> 56:31.663
...pick up those sticks.

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:05.252
Come on, you bitch.

01:00:46.836 --> 01:00:49.629
OK, Pai Mei.

01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:53.592
Here I come.

01:03:02.763 --> 01:03:05.765
May I have a glass of water, please?

01:05:44.091 --> 01:05:48.303
- So that's a Texas funeral?
- Yep.

01:05:49.096 --> 01:05:51.347
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

01:05:51.432 --> 01:05:54.392
That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

01:05:54.477 --> 01:05:57.103
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

01:05:57.813 --> 01:05:59.230
Paula...

01:06:01.275 --> 01:06:03.318
...Schultz.

01:06:08.491 --> 01:06:10.158
Can I look at the sword?

01:06:10.242 --> 01:06:13.703
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

01:06:13.788 --> 01:06:15.663
It sure is.

01:06:16.457 --> 01:06:19.167
Well then, it's your sword now.

01:06:37.895 --> 01:06:40.063
What's that you said?

01:06:40.147 --> 01:06:42.774
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

01:06:42.858 --> 01:06:44.943
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

01:06:45.027 --> 01:06:47.946
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

01:06:49.365 --> 01:06:51.491
Yeah, once.

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:54.160
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

01:07:03.379 --> 01:07:07.006
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword...

01:07:08.551 --> 01:07:12.262
...you compare it
to every other sword ever made -

01:07:12.346 --> 01:07:16.558
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

01:07:25.234 --> 01:07:28.486
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.622
So...

01:07:40.374 --> 01:07:42.417
...which "R" are you filled with?

01:07:43.502 --> 01:07:45.086
What?

01:07:48.174 --> 01:07:49.716
They say...

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.427
...the number one killer...

01:07:52.511 --> 01:07:54.345
...of old people...

01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:56.014
...is retirement.

01:07:57.975 --> 01:08:04.063
People got a job to do, they tend to live
a little bit longer so they can do it.

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:08.026
I've always figured that...

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:10.987
...warriors and their enemies...

01:08:11.071 --> 01:08:13.865
...share the same relationship.

01:08:13.949 --> 01:08:16.701
So now that you're not gonna have
to face your enemy no more

01:08:16.785 --> 01:08:19.537
on the battlefield...

01:08:20.538 --> 01:08:23.957
...which "R" ya filled with?

01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:26.961
Relief...

01:08:29.965 --> 01:08:31.799
...or regret?

01:08:33.469 --> 01:08:37.221
- A little bit of both.
- Horseshit.

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:41.935
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

01:08:42.019 --> 01:08:45.479
But I know damn well that you feel one...

01:08:45.564 --> 01:08:48.316
...more than you feel the other.

01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:53.779
And the question was:
Which one is it?

01:08:54.782 --> 01:08:56.115
Regret.

01:08:57.826 --> 01:09:00.245
You know,
you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

01:09:00.328 --> 01:09:04.040
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

01:09:05.167 --> 01:09:07.252
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

01:09:07.336 --> 01:09:09.170
And I tried to tell him...

01:09:09.755 --> 01:09:12.131
...she was just smart for a blond.

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:34.194
Thanks a bunch.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.457
All right.

01:10:17.698 --> 01:10:19.490
Mmm.

01:10:19.575 --> 01:10:21.034
I'm sorry, Budd.

01:10:21.118 --> 01:10:23.745
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

01:10:23.829 --> 01:10:27.957
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.

01:10:28.042 --> 01:10:31.085
Black mamba, this is Budd.

01:10:31.754 --> 01:10:33.588
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

01:10:33.672 --> 01:10:35.798
I looked him up on the Internet.

01:10:35.883 --> 01:10:39.177
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

01:10:39.261 --> 01:10:40.553
Listen to this:

01:10:45.893 --> 01:10:48.061
"In Africa, the saying goes,

01:10:48.145 --> 01:10:52.357
"'In the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you,

01:10:52.441 --> 01:10:56.527
"'and a black mamba can kill you.
But only with the mamba,

01:10:56.612 --> 01:11:01.074
"and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time, is death sure.'

01:11:01.158 --> 01:11:07.914
Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate."'
Pretty cool, huh?

01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:13.044
"Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

01:11:13.128 --> 01:11:16.422
"acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.

01:11:16.507 --> 01:11:20.051
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being in four hours

01:11:20.135 --> 01:11:22.887
"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

01:11:22.971 --> 01:11:26.307
"However, a bite to the face or torso

01:11:26.392 --> 01:11:30.103
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

01:11:30.187 --> 01:11:33.481
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

01:11:35.275 --> 01:11:38.319
"The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bite

01:11:38.404 --> 01:11:40.071
can be gargantuan."

01:11:41.532 --> 01:11:43.991
You know, I've always liked
that word, "gargantuan."

01:11:44.076 --> 01:11:47.912
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

01:11:47.996 --> 01:11:50.331
"If not treated quickly with antivenom,

01:11:50.416 --> 01:11:53.251
"ten to 15 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings.

01:11:53.335 --> 01:11:55.753
"However, the black mamba can deliver

01:11:55.838 --> 01:12:00.758
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams
of venom from a single bite."

01:12:03.971 --> 01:12:05.680
Now...

01:12:07.015 --> 01:12:11.185
...in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:14.564
let me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.361
Right at this moment...

01:12:21.029 --> 01:12:24.240
...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

01:12:26.326 --> 01:12:32.248
Regret that maybe
the greatest warrior I have ever met

01:12:32.332 --> 01:12:38.379
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

01:12:38.464 --> 01:12:41.549
alkie, piece of shit like you.

01:12:44.344 --> 01:12:46.679
That woman deserved better.

01:13:30.766 --> 01:13:31.933
Bill...

01:13:33.602 --> 01:13:35.603
...I have some tragic news.

01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:38.856
Your brother's dead.

01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:41.526
I am so sorry, baby.

01:13:42.611 --> 01:13:45.988
She put a black mamba in his camper.

01:13:46.073 --> 01:13:48.616
I got her, sweetie.
She's dead.

01:13:51.119 --> 01:13:52.912
Let me put it this way:

01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:57.333
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.

01:13:57.417 --> 01:14:01.337
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

01:14:01.421 --> 01:14:04.340
Take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

01:14:04.424 --> 01:14:08.594
on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for
the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

01:14:08.679 --> 01:14:10.805
and lay them on the grave.

01:14:10.889 --> 01:14:16.894
'Cause you will be standing at the final
resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

01:14:16.979 --> 01:14:19.438
- Marty Kitrosser?
- Here.

01:14:19.523 --> 01:14:21.107
- Melanie Harrhouse?
- Here.

01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:23.901
- Beatrix Kiddo?
- Here.

01:14:23.986 --> 01:14:27.280
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

01:14:27.364 --> 01:14:29.115
Do you want me to come over?

01:14:29.908 --> 01:14:32.910
No, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

01:14:35.998 --> 01:14:38.833
OK. I'm leaving now.

01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:42.128
You go smoke some pot or somethin'.
I'll be there soon.

01:15:43.565 --> 01:15:45.399
Ugh.

01:15:45.484 --> 01:15:46.984
Gross.

01:16:58.515 --> 01:16:59.932
Hi-ya!

01:17:10.527 --> 01:17:14.947
"To my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved. Bill."

01:17:26.501 --> 01:17:28.085
What's that?

01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:32.798
Budd's Hanzo sword.

01:17:32.883 --> 01:17:35.384
He said he pawned it.

01:17:35.469 --> 01:17:39.096
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

01:17:42.559 --> 01:17:45.436
- Elle?
- Bea.

01:17:46.313 --> 01:17:49.356
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

01:17:49.441 --> 01:17:51.901
Just between us girls...

01:17:53.195 --> 01:17:57.698
...what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

01:17:57.783 --> 01:18:00.451
Ow!

01:18:01.453 --> 01:18:04.705
I called him a miserable old fool.

01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:09.835
Ooh. Bad idea.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.712
Know what I did?

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:15.966
I killed that miserable old fool.

01:18:17.886 --> 01:18:20.679
How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

01:18:20.764 --> 01:18:23.307
I poisoned his fish heads.

01:18:23.391 --> 01:18:26.977
Elle, you treacherous dog.

01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:34.026
I - give - you - my - word --

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:35.319
And I told him,

01:18:35.403 --> 01:18:39.323
"To me, the word
of an old fool like you

01:18:39.407 --> 01:18:43.410
is worth less than nothing."

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.167
That's right.

01:18:50.252 --> 01:18:52.336
I killed your master.

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.047
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:57.675
With your own sword, no less.

01:18:57.759 --> 01:19:03.430
Which, in the very immediate future,
will become my sword.

01:19:06.101 --> 01:19:07.601
Bitch...

01:19:08.436 --> 01:19:10.813
...you don't have a future.

01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:06.035
Fucking bitch!

01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:18.631
I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

01:20:19.507 --> 01:20:23.427
You bitch! You bitch!

01:20:28.183 --> 01:20:30.267
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

01:20:32.812 --> 01:20:35.189
Oh, I'll get you!

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:39.860
I'm gonna...

01:20:39.945 --> 01:20:43.238
Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!

01:20:45.283 --> 01:20:48.953
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

01:20:49.037 --> 01:20:51.872
You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

01:20:54.042 --> 01:20:57.753
Oh... shit!

01:22:24.799 --> 01:22:27.509
Like most men
who never knew their father,

01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:29.887
Bill collected father figures.

01:22:29.971 --> 01:22:33.015
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

01:22:33.099 --> 01:22:37.061
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

01:22:37.145 --> 01:22:41.190
He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico,
for over 50 years.

01:22:41.274 --> 01:22:43.734
His army, the Acuna Boys,

01:22:43.818 --> 01:22:48.113
made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.

01:22:48.198 --> 01:22:50.532
He ran the Acuna Boys.

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:57.289
Now, at the age of 80, it would be
this retired gentleman of leisure

01:22:57.373 --> 01:23:00.709
who could point me in Bill's direction.

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.546
SeÅˆor Esteban Vihaio?

01:23:06.424 --> 01:23:07.758
Yes.

01:23:07.842 --> 01:23:09.843
May I join you?

01:23:11.888 --> 01:23:15.099
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

01:23:15.183 --> 01:23:19.770
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

01:23:24.109 --> 01:23:25.359
Americana?

01:23:25.443 --> 01:23:27.152
Yes.

01:23:27.237 --> 01:23:30.030
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

01:23:30.115 --> 01:23:33.617
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

01:23:33.701 --> 01:23:36.286
I haven't spoken it in a while,

01:23:36.371 --> 01:23:39.706
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:42.668
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:47.089
It's my pleasure to be in the company
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

01:23:47.173 --> 01:23:49.967
I must warn you, young lady...

01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:53.262
...I am susceptible to flattery.

01:23:56.141 --> 01:23:58.308
How may I be of service to you?

01:24:06.568 --> 01:24:08.402
Where's Bill?

01:24:10.697 --> 01:24:13.031
Ahh.

01:24:13.408 --> 01:24:15.534
You must be Beatrix.

01:24:17.537 --> 01:24:19.746
I can see the attraction.

01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:27.671
I remember when Bill was only
five years old, I took him to the movies.

01:24:27.755 --> 01:24:31.425
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

01:24:31.509 --> 01:24:35.721
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.

01:24:36.681 --> 01:24:39.850
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

01:24:39.934 --> 01:24:45.480
Bill would begin compulsively to
suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

01:24:45.565 --> 01:24:51.278
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

01:24:56.868 --> 01:24:58.785
Mmm.

01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:00.537
You know...

01:25:00.622 --> 01:25:04.541
...being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

01:25:04.626 --> 01:25:07.711
...is always the right thing to do.

01:25:10.048 --> 01:25:14.885
If we had met when I was
back in business...

01:25:14.969 --> 01:25:18.972
...you would have been
my number one lady.

01:25:21.976 --> 01:25:26.313
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

01:25:27.941 --> 01:25:31.985
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:34.738
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

01:25:35.615 --> 01:25:37.783
The Pussy died. Hmm.

01:25:41.496 --> 01:25:44.373
Bill shot you in the head, no?

01:25:44.457 --> 01:25:46.083
- Yes.
- Hmm.

01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:51.296
I would have been much nicer.

01:25:51.381 --> 01:25:53.799
I would have just cut your face.

01:25:56.844 --> 01:25:58.512
You must forgive me.

01:25:58.596 --> 01:26:01.390
Please... you have a drink with me.

01:26:04.394 --> 01:26:06.520
Clara!

01:26:10.024 --> 01:26:11.525
Coming.

01:26:14.195 --> 01:26:16.613
Dos aÅˆejo.

01:26:29.043 --> 01:26:30.544
Gracias.

01:26:35.758 --> 01:26:38.885
What were we talking about?

01:26:45.101 --> 01:26:46.977
Bill.

01:26:48.896 --> 01:26:52.816
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill?

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.651
Yeah. Hmm.

01:26:55.528 --> 01:26:59.906
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

01:27:01.075 --> 01:27:03.577
I will draw you a map.

01:27:04.996 --> 01:27:07.372
Bill is like a son to me.

01:27:08.916 --> 01:27:13.003
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

01:27:13.087 --> 01:27:15.005
Because he would want me to.

01:27:16.424 --> 01:27:18.175
Now, that I don't believe.

01:27:18.259 --> 01:27:21.219
Ahh.

01:27:21.304 --> 01:27:25.098
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

01:28:34.001 --> 01:28:35.585
Freeze, Mommy.

01:28:35.670 --> 01:28:38.422
Bang, bang! Oh!

01:28:38.548 --> 01:28:39.923
Oh! She got us, B.B.

01:28:40.007 --> 01:28:42.968
Mommy got us.
Oh, I'm dying!

01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:45.095
I'm dying.

01:28:47.682 --> 01:28:51.268
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

01:28:52.812 --> 01:28:59.359
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know
that little B.B. was only playing possum,

01:28:59.444 --> 01:29:04.281
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

01:29:04.365 --> 01:29:06.575
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

01:29:06.659 --> 01:29:10.287
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

01:29:10.371 --> 01:29:16.126
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

01:29:16.210 --> 01:29:21.840
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

01:29:23.509 --> 01:29:24.885
Bang, bang!

01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:37.022
You're dead, Mommy.
So die.

01:29:37.857 --> 01:29:39.149
Oh!

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:43.737
B.B.

01:29:47.283 --> 01:29:50.911
Oh! B.B....

01:29:53.915 --> 01:29:56.124
I should've known.

01:29:57.043 --> 01:29:59.920
You are... the best.

01:30:07.303 --> 01:30:10.305
Oh, Mommy.
Don't die.

01:30:10.389 --> 01:30:12.516
I was just playing.

01:30:17.897 --> 01:30:19.439
I know.

01:30:33.412 --> 01:30:35.455
I told her you were asleep...

01:30:36.541 --> 01:30:41.336
...but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:45.674
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

01:30:45.758 --> 01:30:48.468
then how will she know what I look like?"

01:30:48.553 --> 01:30:55.267
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

01:30:56.143 --> 01:30:58.144
That's what I said.

01:30:59.146 --> 01:31:02.482
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

01:31:02.567 --> 01:31:07.070
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

01:31:07.154 --> 01:31:11.491
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

01:31:22.670 --> 01:31:24.838
Now, let me look at you.

01:31:26.132 --> 01:31:28.675
Oh.

01:31:31.596 --> 01:31:35.515
My, my, my,
what a pretty little girl you are.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.517
You're pretty too, Mommy.

01:31:43.858 --> 01:31:47.152
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

01:31:47.361 --> 01:31:48.612
Mnh-mnh.

01:31:48.696 --> 01:31:51.197
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

01:31:51.282 --> 01:31:53.950
Come on. You know what you said.

01:31:54.035 --> 01:31:57.495
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good. Come on.

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:01.124
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

01:32:01.208 --> 01:32:03.335
I said... I said,

01:32:03.419 --> 01:32:09.549
"You're the most beautifulest woman
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

01:32:11.385 --> 01:32:15.180
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

01:32:15.264 --> 01:32:22.020
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

01:32:22.104 --> 01:32:27.275
- Yes, I do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.113
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

01:32:32.198 --> 01:32:38.078
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

01:32:39.121 --> 01:32:44.876
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.837
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

01:32:47.922 --> 01:32:51.257
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

01:32:53.886 --> 01:32:58.181
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

01:32:58.265 --> 01:33:02.477
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

01:33:04.438 --> 01:33:06.439
I killed him.

01:33:07.441 --> 01:33:11.903
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfish.

01:33:12.697 --> 01:33:17.200
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

01:33:17.284 --> 01:33:20.453
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

01:33:22.123 --> 01:33:25.875
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.211
How did he die?"

01:33:28.295 --> 01:33:31.631
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

01:33:31.716 --> 01:33:36.886
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

01:33:36.971 --> 01:33:39.723
"I accidentally stepped on him."

01:33:41.016 --> 01:33:42.809
To which I queried,

01:33:42.893 --> 01:33:48.440
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

01:33:48.524 --> 01:33:52.861
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when I stepped on him."

01:33:52.945 --> 01:33:56.156
Mmm. The plot thickens.

01:33:56.866 --> 01:34:01.745
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

01:34:01.829 --> 01:34:05.081
And, Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

01:34:07.543 --> 01:34:09.669
She didn't lie.

01:34:09.754 --> 01:34:13.923
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

01:34:14.008 --> 01:34:16.426
...and put him on the carpet.

01:34:19.096 --> 01:34:22.223
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

01:34:23.225 --> 01:34:25.101
Flapping.

01:34:25.936 --> 01:34:30.106
- And then you stomped on him.
- Uh-huh.

01:34:30.191 --> 01:34:32.734
And when you lifted up your foot...

01:34:33.861 --> 01:34:37.822
- ...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

01:34:37.907 --> 01:34:40.867
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

01:34:43.204 --> 01:34:44.996
She told me later...

01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:48.166
...that the second she lifted up her foot

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:52.462
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

01:34:52.546 --> 01:34:57.592
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

01:34:57.676 --> 01:35:03.014
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

01:35:05.017 --> 01:35:10.730
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death...

01:35:10.815 --> 01:35:12.607
...knew what it meant.

01:35:13.859 --> 01:35:17.487
- You loved Emilio, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

01:35:17.571 --> 01:35:20.490
Well... I love Mommy too.

01:35:22.034 --> 01:35:24.327
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

01:35:24.411 --> 01:35:28.248
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

01:35:28.332 --> 01:35:30.375
I shot Mommy.

01:35:30.459 --> 01:35:33.628
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

01:35:33.712 --> 01:35:35.505
I shot her for real.

01:35:35.589 --> 01:35:38.049
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

01:35:38.133 --> 01:35:42.679
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

01:35:42.763 --> 01:35:47.392
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

01:35:47.476 --> 01:35:51.312
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

01:35:53.399 --> 01:35:55.567
And that's when I learned...

01:35:55.651 --> 01:36:00.947
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

01:36:03.951 --> 01:36:09.122
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

01:36:09.206 --> 01:36:12.333
You OK, Mommy?
Does it hurt?

01:36:12.418 --> 01:36:14.335
No, sweetie.

01:36:16.213 --> 01:36:18.214
Doesn't hurt anymore.

01:36:24.305 --> 01:36:26.556
Did it make you sick?

01:36:27.224 --> 01:36:31.728
No. It made me sleep.

01:36:31.812 --> 01:36:34.898
That's why I haven't been with you. B.B.
I've been asleep.

01:36:34.982 --> 01:36:37.817
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

01:36:38.485 --> 01:36:41.779
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

01:36:41.864 --> 01:36:47.118
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

01:36:47.202 --> 01:36:48.578
Uh-huh.

01:36:48.662 --> 01:36:52.165
Mommy, do you want to watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

01:36:52.249 --> 01:36:55.251
Oh, yeah!
I would love to.

01:36:55.336 --> 01:36:58.046
- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.

01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:00.548
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

01:37:00.633 --> 01:37:04.719
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

01:37:04.803 --> 01:37:09.515
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

01:37:16.023 --> 01:37:21.486
When I was little,
my father was famous.

01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:25.782
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

01:37:25.866 --> 01:37:29.160
And he was the shogun's decapitator.

01:37:29.244 --> 01:37:34.290
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

01:37:34.375 --> 01:37:38.962
My father would come home to Mother
and when he would see her,

01:37:39.046 --> 01:37:41.798
he would forget about the killings.

01:37:41.882 --> 01:37:46.970
He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.

01:37:47.054 --> 01:37:49.722
Maybe that was the problem.

01:37:49.807 --> 01:37:52.684
One night, the shogun sent...

01:38:05.406 --> 01:38:10.994
My man got a heart

01:38:11.078 --> 01:38:16.499
Like the rock that's in the sea

01:38:23.841 --> 01:38:29.095
Well, no one told me about her

01:38:30.848 --> 01:38:33.266
The way she lied

01:38:36.353 --> 01:38:42.025
Well, no one told me about her

01:38:42.693 --> 01:38:45.862
How many people cried

01:38:55.289 --> 01:39:00.793
My man got a heart

01:39:00.878 --> 01:39:06.299
Like the rock that's in the sea

01:39:07.885 --> 01:39:12.722
My man got a heart

01:39:12.806 --> 01:39:18.728
Like the rock that's in the sea

01:39:26.153 --> 01:39:31.491
Well, no one told me about her

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.661
The way she lied

01:39:38.582 --> 01:39:44.337
Well, no one told me about her

01:39:45.297 --> 01:39:48.091
How many people cried

01:39:49.676 --> 01:39:55.348
But it's too late to say you're sorry

01:39:55.849 --> 01:39:58.101
How would I know?

01:39:58.185 --> 01:40:01.187
Why should I care?

01:40:02.397 --> 01:40:07.693
Please don't bother trying to find her

01:40:08.153 --> 01:40:12.865
She's not there

01:40:14.409 --> 01:40:17.328
I was just admiring your sword.

01:40:18.413 --> 01:40:20.331
Quite a piece of work.

01:40:21.667 --> 01:40:25.670
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

01:40:25.754 --> 01:40:27.213
He's good.

01:40:29.216 --> 01:40:31.217
Has his sushi gotten any better?

01:40:35.013 --> 01:40:40.101
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

01:40:40.185 --> 01:40:44.522
It was easy.
I just dropped your name, Bill.

01:40:44.606 --> 01:40:46.691
That'd do it.

01:40:59.663 --> 01:41:17.805
Well, no one told me about her

01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:23.227
I suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am I right?

01:41:25.272 --> 01:41:26.856
Well,

01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:32.028
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

01:41:32.112 --> 01:41:36.449
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

01:41:36.533 --> 01:41:38.201
bathed in moonlight.

01:41:39.536 --> 01:41:42.455
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

01:41:42.539 --> 01:41:49.128
So, swordfighter, if you want
a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

01:41:49.213 --> 01:41:53.382
But if you wanna be old school about it...

01:41:53.467 --> 01:41:57.136
...and you know
I'm all about old school...

01:41:57.221 --> 01:42:00.890
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

01:42:00.974 --> 01:42:03.142
like a couple of real-life honest...

01:42:05.354 --> 01:42:10.608
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

01:42:10.692 --> 01:42:13.945
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

01:42:16.031 --> 01:42:20.493
I'm just fuckin' with you.

01:42:21.495 --> 01:42:22.954
Now...

01:42:23.705 --> 01:42:26.290
...when it comes to you...

01:42:26.375 --> 01:42:28.042
...and us...

01:42:30.003 --> 01:42:33.172
...I have a few unanswered questions.

01:42:33.257 --> 01:42:38.803
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

01:42:39.805 --> 01:42:44.392
I'm gonna ask you some questions,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

01:42:45.143 --> 01:42:48.145
However, therein lies a dilemma.

01:42:49.398 --> 01:42:51.983
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

01:42:52.067 --> 01:42:57.280
I believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

01:42:57.364 --> 01:43:01.909
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

01:43:01.994 --> 01:43:05.329
And when it comes to the subject of me,

01:43:05.414 --> 01:43:12.128
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

01:43:12.212 --> 01:43:14.422
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

01:43:14.506 --> 01:43:16.048
Well,

01:43:16.133 --> 01:43:18.342
it just so happens,

01:43:18.427 --> 01:43:20.469
I have a solution.

01:43:20.554 --> 01:43:23.014
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

01:43:23.098 --> 01:43:25.308
Goddamn!

01:43:27.769 --> 01:43:31.188
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

01:43:31.273 --> 01:43:35.026
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

01:43:35.694 --> 01:43:39.655
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

01:43:43.368 --> 01:43:49.623
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

01:43:49.708 --> 01:43:54.170
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

01:43:54.254 --> 01:43:57.256
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

01:43:57.341 --> 01:44:01.886
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

01:44:02.929 --> 01:44:08.809
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

01:44:08.894 --> 01:44:11.437
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

01:44:11.521 --> 01:44:14.899
- No.
- Too bad.

01:44:16.026 --> 01:44:18.194
As you know...

01:44:18.278 --> 01:44:21.906
...I'm quite keen on comic books.

01:44:22.574 --> 01:44:25.493
Especially the ones about superheroes.

01:44:25.577 --> 01:44:31.207
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

01:44:31.291 --> 01:44:34.919
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

01:44:35.962 --> 01:44:39.048
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.

01:44:40.634 --> 01:44:41.634
Mmm.

01:44:42.427 --> 01:44:44.804
But the mythology...

01:44:44.888 --> 01:44:48.307
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

01:44:48.975 --> 01:44:52.603
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

01:44:52.687 --> 01:44:56.565
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

01:44:56.650 --> 01:45:01.862
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

01:45:01.947 --> 01:45:04.907
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

01:45:04.991 --> 01:45:09.286
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

01:45:10.330 --> 01:45:14.291
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

01:45:14.376 --> 01:45:18.879
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

01:45:19.548 --> 01:45:25.428
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

01:45:25.512 --> 01:45:28.305
Superman didn't become Superman.

01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:30.975
Superman was born Superman.

01:45:31.059 --> 01:45:34.562
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

01:45:35.564 --> 01:45:38.149
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

01:45:39.025 --> 01:45:42.153
His outfit with the big red "S" -

01:45:42.237 --> 01:45:45.948
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

01:45:46.032 --> 01:45:48.451
Those are his clothes.

01:45:48.994 --> 01:45:54.248
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

01:45:54.332 --> 01:45:58.836
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

01:46:00.505 --> 01:46:04.008
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

01:46:04.092 --> 01:46:07.261
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

01:46:07.345 --> 01:46:08.888
He's weak...

01:46:09.848 --> 01:46:12.641
...he's unsure of himself...

01:46:12.726 --> 01:46:14.518
...he's a coward.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:20.608
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.031
Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

01:46:28.074 --> 01:46:30.284
Aso.

01:46:30.368 --> 01:46:32.703
The point emerges.

01:46:34.372 --> 01:46:37.875
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

01:46:37.959 --> 01:46:40.836
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

01:46:41.838 --> 01:46:46.967
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

01:46:47.052 --> 01:46:49.053
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

01:46:56.311 --> 01:46:58.646
Are you calling me a superhero?

01:46:58.730 --> 01:47:00.231
I'm calling you a killer.

01:47:00.899 --> 01:47:03.817
A natural born killer.

01:47:03.902 --> 01:47:07.571
You always have been,
and you always will be.

01:47:07.656 --> 01:47:09.782
Moving to El Paso...

01:47:09.866 --> 01:47:13.244
...working in a used record store...

01:47:13.328 --> 01:47:15.996
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

01:47:16.081 --> 01:47:17.540
...clipping coupons.

01:47:17.624 --> 01:47:19.458
That's you...

01:47:19.543 --> 01:47:22.962
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

01:47:23.046 --> 01:47:26.090
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

01:47:26.174 --> 01:47:28.300
But you're not a worker bee.

01:47:29.553 --> 01:47:32.263
You're a renegade killer bee.

01:47:32.347 --> 01:47:35.474
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

01:47:35.559 --> 01:47:38.602
or how fat your ass got,

01:47:38.687 --> 01:47:42.606
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

01:47:44.985 --> 01:47:46.777
First question:

01:47:49.155 --> 01:47:53.826
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

01:48:00.250 --> 01:48:01.959
No!

01:48:05.505 --> 01:48:08.549
But I would've had B.B.!

01:48:08.633 --> 01:48:11.218
Don't get me wrong.

01:48:11.303 --> 01:48:15.222
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

01:48:15.307 --> 01:48:17.391
But you are a killer.

01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:24.648
All those people you killed to get to me...

01:48:24.733 --> 01:48:27.318
...felt damn good, didn't they?

01:48:29.404 --> 01:48:31.071
Yes.

01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:34.408
Every single one of them?

01:48:44.502 --> 01:48:46.337
Yes.

01:48:49.674 --> 01:48:52.217
That was the warmup round.

01:48:52.302 --> 01:48:56.972
Now comes the $64,000 question.

01:49:04.314 --> 01:49:08.025
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

01:49:11.863 --> 01:49:15.282
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

01:49:15.367 --> 01:49:17.076
Of course.

01:49:17.827 --> 01:49:19.870
Lisa Wong.

01:49:21.122 --> 01:49:23.916
The morning I left, I was sick.

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:28.545
On the plane, I threw up.

01:49:29.881 --> 01:49:32.383
So I started thinking:

01:49:33.802 --> 01:49:36.011
Maybe I was pregnant.

01:49:36.096 --> 01:49:41.433
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

01:49:42.727 --> 01:49:45.229
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

01:49:45.313 --> 01:49:48.774
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

01:50:25.019 --> 01:50:26.019
Fuck.

01:50:26.104 --> 01:50:28.313
What I didn't know...

01:50:28.398 --> 01:50:32.526
...was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.

01:50:32.610 --> 01:50:38.782
With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong
long to send an assassin of her own.

01:50:39.951 --> 01:50:41.452
-
- Hello, can I help you?

01:50:41.536 --> 01:50:44.997
Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

01:50:45.081 --> 01:50:47.082
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

01:50:47.167 --> 01:50:48.417
Oh, that's nice. Um...

01:50:49.794 --> 01:50:51.462
Can you just leave it by the door?

01:51:03.975 --> 01:51:07.853
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that I have to be at this range,

01:51:07.937 --> 01:51:09.813
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

01:51:09.898 --> 01:51:12.941
Well, guess what, bitch?
I'm better than Annie Oakley.

01:51:13.026 --> 01:51:16.403
- And I got you right in my sight.
- I could blow your fuckin' head off.

01:51:16.488 --> 01:51:20.657
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

01:51:22.368 --> 01:51:24.161
Karen...

01:51:26.372 --> 01:51:28.791
...I just found out...

01:51:28.875 --> 01:51:30.709
...right now...

01:51:30.794 --> 01:51:35.047
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

01:51:36.841 --> 01:51:41.094
- ...that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

01:51:41.179 --> 01:51:43.555
On the floor by the door...

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:47.309
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

01:51:47.393 --> 01:51:48.560
Bullshit.

01:51:49.687 --> 01:51:53.232
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

01:51:53.316 --> 01:51:55.150
This time...

01:51:56.736 --> 01:51:58.529
...you're 100 percent wrong.

01:52:00.573 --> 01:52:03.492
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

01:52:04.494 --> 01:52:06.620
But right now...

01:52:06.704 --> 01:52:09.373
...I'm just scared shitless for my baby.

01:52:10.166 --> 01:52:11.834
Please.

01:52:13.378 --> 01:52:15.754
Just look at the strip.

01:52:17.757 --> 01:52:19.550
Please.

01:52:20.844 --> 01:52:25.556
Stay where you are and don't move.

01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:44.700
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

01:52:44.784 --> 01:52:46.743
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

01:52:59.257 --> 01:53:01.049
"Easy to use.

01:53:01.134 --> 01:53:05.679
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

01:53:05.763 --> 01:53:07.389
Blue means pregnant.

01:53:07.473 --> 01:53:10.225
I'll read it myself, thank you.

01:53:18.026 --> 01:53:19.735
Oh, OK.

01:53:19.819 --> 01:53:21.695
Say I were to believe you.
What then?

01:53:21.779 --> 01:53:23.822
Just go home.

01:53:26.117 --> 01:53:28.285
I'll do the same.

01:53:47.805 --> 01:53:49.473
Congratulations.

01:53:53.061 --> 01:53:55.854
Before that strip turned blue...

01:53:55.939 --> 01:53:58.398
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:02.653
I was a killer who killed for you.

01:54:02.737 --> 01:54:06.198
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

01:54:06.282 --> 01:54:08.325
onto a speeding train.

01:54:09.327 --> 01:54:11.078
For you.

01:54:12.664 --> 01:54:16.083
But once that strip turned blue...

01:54:16.167 --> 01:54:19.544
...I could no longer do
any of those things.

01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:22.089
Not anymore.

01:54:22.173 --> 01:54:24.549
Because I was gonna be a mother.

01:54:27.762 --> 01:54:29.680
Can you understand that?

01:54:32.767 --> 01:54:34.434
Yes.

01:54:35.436 --> 01:54:37.646
But why didn't you...

01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:40.023
...tell me then, instead of now?

01:54:41.025 --> 01:54:43.318
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

01:54:43.403 --> 01:54:45.362
And I didn't want that.

01:54:46.114 --> 01:54:48.323
Not your decision to make.

01:54:48.408 --> 01:54:50.450
Yes.

01:54:50.535 --> 01:54:53.870
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

01:54:54.872 --> 01:54:58.583
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

01:54:59.585 --> 01:55:01.586
But with you...

01:55:01.671 --> 01:55:05.549
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:09.469
I had to choose.

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:12.681
I chose her.

01:55:15.143 --> 01:55:17.936
You know, five years ago,

01:55:18.021 --> 01:55:22.858
if I had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

01:55:22.942 --> 01:55:28.071
you performing a coup de grÈƒce on me
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

01:55:31.075 --> 01:55:33.702
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

01:55:35.371 --> 01:55:37.456
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

01:55:38.708 --> 01:55:40.542
I-I'm sorry.

01:55:40.626 --> 01:55:42.711
Was that a question?

01:55:44.047 --> 01:55:46.548
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

01:55:46.632 --> 01:55:50.093
yes, in this instance
you would've been wrong.

01:55:50.595 --> 01:55:52.012
Well?

01:55:52.096 --> 01:55:55.640
When you never came back,

01:55:55.725 --> 01:56:01.813
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

01:56:01.898 --> 01:56:05.192
Oh! And for the record...

01:56:05.276 --> 01:56:09.446
...letting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:11.406
is quite cruel.

01:56:14.952 --> 01:56:18.872
I mourned you for three months.

01:56:19.665 --> 01:56:22.959
And in the third month of mourning you...

01:56:24.087 --> 01:56:26.379
...I tracked you down.

01:56:26.464 --> 01:56:28.673
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

01:56:28.758 --> 01:56:33.095
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

01:56:34.222 --> 01:56:36.098
So I find you...

01:56:37.767 --> 01:56:40.018
...and what do I find?

01:56:40.103 --> 01:56:43.355
Not only are you not dead...

01:56:43.439 --> 01:56:47.651
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

01:56:49.737 --> 01:56:52.197
And you're pregnant.

01:56:55.576 --> 01:56:58.120
I overreacted.

01:57:06.712 --> 01:57:10.549
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

01:57:10.633 --> 01:57:13.135
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

01:57:13.219 --> 01:57:15.512
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

01:57:15.596 --> 01:57:20.392
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

01:57:22.395 --> 01:57:24.062
I'm a killer.

01:57:25.064 --> 01:57:27.566
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

01:57:28.484 --> 01:57:31.403
And there are consequences...

01:57:31.487 --> 01:57:34.865
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

01:57:35.867 --> 01:57:38.368
You experienced some of them.

01:57:41.956 --> 01:57:45.625
Was my reaction really that surprising?

01:57:45.710 --> 01:57:49.754
Yes. It was.

01:57:51.716 --> 01:57:55.468
Could you do what you did?

01:57:55.553 --> 01:57:57.596
Of course you could.

01:57:59.390 --> 01:58:05.896
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:08.899
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

01:58:08.983 --> 01:58:11.234
...but you thought wrong.

01:58:17.408 --> 01:58:21.620
You and I have unfinished business.

01:58:22.413 --> 01:58:25.790
Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

01:58:58.783 --> 01:59:04.287
Pai Mei taught you the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

01:59:07.291 --> 01:59:09.626
'Course he did.

01:59:11.379 --> 01:59:13.505
Why didn't you tell me?

01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:19.469
I don't know.

01:59:21.722 --> 01:59:23.556
Because I'm...

01:59:24.642 --> 01:59:26.810
...a bad person.

01:59:27.853 --> 01:59:29.521
No.

01:59:31.482 --> 01:59:34.567
You're not a bad person.

01:59:34.652 --> 01:59:37.570
You're a terrific person.

01:59:37.655 --> 01:59:40.991
You're my favorite person.

01:59:42.159 --> 01:59:45.120
But every once in a while...

01:59:46.122 --> 01:59:48.081
...you can be a real cunt.

02:00:07.685 --> 02:00:09.644
How do I look?

02:00:25.202 --> 02:00:27.787
You look ready.

02:02:14.437 --> 02:02:18.648
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little flower.

02:02:23.487 --> 02:02:26.948
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
America and all the ships at sea.

02:02:27.032 --> 02:02:29.075
Let's go to press. Flash.

02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:31.870
Do you have a magpie in your home?

02:02:31.954 --> 02:02:34.289
If you do, you are most fortunate.

02:02:34.373 --> 02:02:37.959
The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.

02:02:38.043 --> 02:02:40.587
He is the best friend a farmer ever had.

02:02:40.671 --> 02:02:43.715
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

02:02:43.799 --> 02:02:48.303
And always remember,
the magpie deserves your respect.

02:03:24.215 --> 02:03:25.590
Thank you.

02:03:26.842 --> 02:03:29.677
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:03:31.096 --> 02:03:33.097
Oh, thank you.

02:03:35.309 --> 02:03:37.352
Now, I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.

02:03:37.436 --> 02:03:39.979
I ain't got no headache.

02:03:40.064 --> 02:03:43.066
Oh yes, you have, brother.

02:07:37.384 --> 02:07:39.844
There's a nail in the door

02:07:39.928 --> 02:07:42.263
And there's glass on the lawn

02:07:42.347 --> 02:07:46.851
Tacks on the floor, and the TV is on

02:07:46.935 --> 02:07:51.022
And I always sleep with my guns

02:07:51.106 --> 02:07:52.774
When you're gone

02:07:54.610 --> 02:07:56.861
There's a blade by the bed

02:07:56.945 --> 02:07:59.155
And a phone in my hand

02:07:59.239 --> 02:08:01.115
A dog on the floor

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.035
And some cash on the nightstand

02:08:04.119 --> 02:08:07.455
When I'm all alone,
the dreaming stops

02:08:07.539 --> 02:08:10.041
And I just can't stand

02:08:11.794 --> 02:08:16.297
What should I do?
I'm just a little baby

02:08:16.381 --> 02:08:20.551
What if the lights go out and maybe

02:08:20.636 --> 02:08:24.305
And then the wind just starts to moan

02:08:24.389 --> 02:08:28.810
Outside the door,
he followed me home

02:08:28.894 --> 02:08:32.980
Well, goodnight moon,
I want the sun

02:08:33.065 --> 02:08:37.235
If it's not here soon
I might be done

02:08:37.319 --> 02:08:43.741
No, it won't be too soon
'til I say goodnight moon

02:09:02.511 --> 02:09:07.014
Well, you're up so high,
how can you save me?

02:09:07.099 --> 02:09:10.351
When the dark comes here tonight

02:09:10.435 --> 02:09:15.356
To take me up to my
front walk and into bed

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:19.902
Where it kisses my face
and eats my head

02:09:19.987 --> 02:09:24.532
What should I do?
I'm just a little baby

02:09:24.616 --> 02:09:28.452
What if the lights go out and maybe

02:09:28.537 --> 02:09:32.540
And then the wind just starts to moan

02:09:32.624 --> 02:09:36.961
Outside the door,
he followed me home

02:09:37.045 --> 02:09:41.048
Now, goodnight moon
I want the sun

02:09:41.133 --> 02:09:45.386
If it's not here soon,
I might be done

02:09:45.470 --> 02:10:00.318
No, it won't be too soon
'til I say goodnight moon

02:16:47.350 --> 02:16:49.183
And, action!

02:16:52.022 --> 02:16:53.480
Cut.

02:16:54.107 --> 02:16:56.191
Oh, come on.
Let's do it again.
