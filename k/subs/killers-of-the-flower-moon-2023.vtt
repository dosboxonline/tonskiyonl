Welcome home, Ernest.
Welcome home.

It's so good to see you again.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.815

here's your aunt Myrtle

Now, this is a cattle ranch.
There's no oil here.

08:02.656 --> 08:08.139
No oil? Yeah. No oil, no fear,
so I'm settled with no fear.

08:08.313 --> 08:11.665
Time will run out.
This wealth will run dry,

08:11.839 --> 08:15.886
drier than the seven years
of famine that plagued
the pharaohs of old.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.932
They're a sick people.

08:18.106 --> 08:21.152
They're kindly people,
big-hearted people,
but they're sickly.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.722
What about you?
You see bloodshed?

08:26.593 --> 08:28.638
- [clicks tongue] Some.
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.812 --> 08:32.686
Well, I was a--
I was a cook in--
in the infantry.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.078
Mm-hmm.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.689
You see Kelsie Morrison?
He was over there.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.647
- I did.
- Yeah.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.128
Otis Griggs and the others,
if... [stammers]
...if you remember.

08:40.302 --> 08:44.567
Soldiers have to eat.
You fed the soldiers
that won the war.

08:44.741 --> 08:48.397
- Well, saw more die
from the flu, but...
- Mmm.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.007
So what happened
to your stomach?

08:50.181 --> 08:53.576
My-- My gut, it burst.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.144
Mmm, mmm.
You almost lost your life.

08:56.318 --> 09:00.714
They gave me a belt and told me
not to do any heavy lifting.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.326
Well, you made a good choice
coming back here, 'cause here--

09:04.500 --> 09:05.414
I know.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.590
Money flows freely here, now.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.854
Well, I do--
I do love that money, sir.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.073
[both chuckle]

09:12.247 --> 09:13.204
Don't call me "sir."

09:13.378 --> 09:14.815
You call me "Uncle,"

09:14.989 --> 09:17.557
or call me "King,"
like you used to.
Remember?

09:17.731 --> 09:19.341
- Call you "King"?
- Yeah.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.040
King.

09:23.214 --> 09:26.435
Now, you didn't pick up
any disease over there, did you?

09:26.609 --> 09:28.219
- No. No.
- Sure?

09:28.393 --> 09:29.873
I'm sure, sir. I'm sure.

09:30.047 --> 09:32.528
Not that I know of.
[chuckles][chuckles]

09:33.616 --> 09:35.139
You keep that thing
wrapped up over there?

09:35.313 --> 09:37.098
- I did. I did.
- Mmm.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.317
- As best you could.
- As best I could.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.232
[both chuckle]

09:41.406 --> 09:42.451
[Hale] Yeah.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.497
You like women?

09:45.672 --> 09:50.328
Ah, you know I like women.
[chuckles] That's my weakness.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.069
What kinds they got out there?

09:52.243 --> 09:54.942
Just white.
- Just white, that I saw.
- Hmm.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.465
Mm-hmm.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.684
You like red?

09:57.858 --> 09:58.946
Red?

10:00.121 --> 10:01.862
You mean
- that kind of red?
- Mm-hmm.

10:03.037 --> 10:05.605
I like red. I like white.
I like blue.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.476
I like all of 'em. [chuckles]

10:07.650 --> 10:10.914
- Don't matter to me.
I'm greedy. [laughs]
- Mmm. [laughs]

10:11.088 --> 10:16.050
I-- I like the heavy ones.
I like the heavy ones,
pretty ones, soft,

10:16.877 --> 10:19.009
ones that smell good, you know.

10:19.183 --> 10:23.057
Well, we gotta
keep an eye on you.
You're all over the place.

10:24.406 --> 10:25.755
Uh, speaking of that...

10:27.061 --> 10:28.105
Hey, Byron.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.370
Yeah.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.459
Oh.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.853
Oh, yeah, that's good.
That's-- That's real good.

10:37.027 --> 10:40.074
Don't get played out in the open
with alcohol, you hear?

10:41.379 --> 10:43.164
'Cause then
you'll cause trouble.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.949
- Right, Byron?
- That's right, King.

10:46.123 --> 10:49.213
- [Hale] Mmm.
- No, sir. I w--
I won't. I won't.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.694
Now, most fellas out here
are crooked.

10:51.868 --> 10:55.916
Some do things right,
most do bad,
so don't be simple.

10:56.090 --> 10:59.006
- No, sir. I won't.
- Don't make small trouble
about nothing.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.312
You gonna make trouble,
make it big.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.837
Get a big payoff for that,
you hear?

11:04.011 --> 11:05.665
Yes, sir.

11:05.839 --> 11:09.059
You see, I am officially
reserve deputy sheriff
in Fairfax.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.455
I don't want to bring
unwanted eyes.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.500
- I won't find that trouble.
- Yeah.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.415
I won't do stupid things.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.461
And you got
your head on straight
after being over there?

11:19.635 --> 11:24.596
Course I do. I'm not--
I'm not thick, sir.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm strong.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.512
Well, I got a place
I'm gonna put you.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.253
- That'll be driving.
- Mmm.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.778
'Cause you can't do much else
'cause of your gut.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.215
You don't read much, do you?

11:34.781 --> 11:35.825
Read?

11:35.999 --> 11:37.609
Do you read, yeah. Read much?

11:38.654 --> 11:39.699
Well, I can read.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.526
Eh. Well,
you smarten yourself up.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.312
Get him that book
on the Osage, Byron.

11:44.486 --> 11:45.922
- This one?
- Yeah, that one.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.752
- You smarten yourself up.
- I-- I can read, sir.

11:49.926 --> 11:55.845
[Hale chuckles] The Osage.
They have
the worst land possible...

11:56.019 --> 11:59.893
[chuckles] ...but the good Lord,
he outsmarted everybody.

12:00.067 --> 12:03.200
The land had oil on it.
Black gold.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.508
But they're wise people.

12:06.682 --> 12:12.470
They worked it so as they had
the say who gets the oil,
who gets the headrights.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.777
The Osage are sharp.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.521
They don't talk much,
so that might make you feel

12:19.695 --> 12:21.653
like you've got
to run your mouth
to fill the space,

12:21.828 --> 12:23.525
especially you been drinking.

12:23.699 --> 12:27.094
Better you be quiet
if you don't got
nothing smart to say.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.791
Don't get caught on that.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.663
It's what they call,
"blackbird talk."

12:31.838 --> 12:33.578
- [imitates bird]

12:33.753 --> 12:37.931

12:39.367 --> 12:42.892
- [imitates bird]
- [all laughing]

12:44.328 --> 12:45.982
Just 'cause they're not talking,

12:46.156 --> 12:49.072
don't mean they don't know
everything about everything.

12:49.246 --> 12:53.555

What is your allotment number?

14:38.442 --> 14:39.617
Two hundred eighty-five.

14:40.705 --> 14:45.101
You've asked for
additional moneys of $752

14:45.275 --> 14:48.148
to pay a medical bill
for an abscess.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.454
Yes, sir.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.804
Was the operation successful?

14:53.849 --> 14:54.894
Yes, sir.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.287
And the diabetes?

14:57.461 --> 15:02.075
I have a prescription
at Fairfax Drugs. I'll send
my help to fill twice monthly.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.642
You gotta look out for that,
you know.

15:07.384 --> 15:10.213
Now, Mollie, it's your mother.

15:10.387 --> 15:15.479
You know she's restricted too,
so we have to account
for every penny.

15:17.177 --> 15:23.139
It says here she spent
$319 and 05 cents for meat

15:24.445 --> 15:25.837
at the grocery.

15:27.274 --> 15:30.973

that's an awful lot of meat
for what she needs?

15:32.627 --> 15:34.063
Yes, Mr. Beaty.

15:34.237 --> 15:37.806
Well, you'll look after that,
won't you?

15:40.330 --> 15:41.331
Yes.

15:45.553 --> 15:49.165
All right, people.
Let's form a line here
for allotment payments.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.341
Unrestricted only.

He has to be with you

He don't know nothing.
He's an amateur.

to go with her for a time.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.612
They're not together
in a way now,

19:39.178 --> 19:40.875
so that means

19:41.049 --> 19:44.400
you could have
a proposition with that
if that struck you.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.229
Oh. [chuckles]

19:47.403 --> 19:52.016

she's sweet on me too.

- Full-- Full blood estate.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.210
Now, that's something
a man can work with, hmm?

you know that?

20:20.784 --> 20:22.177

- Mm-hmm.

20:27.617 --> 20:28.923
Uh, how do you mean?

20:29.097 --> 20:31.360
Well, we mix
these families together,

20:31.534 --> 20:34.842
and that estate money flows
the right direction,
it'll come to us.

20:37.801 --> 20:42.632
That's a full blood estate.
And she gets that money
of the mother Lizzie.

20:42.806 --> 20:46.723
Now, that's good business there.
And legal, not against the law.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.986
That's smart investment.

21:01.216 --> 21:05.046
They told me you was--
you was going with Matt Williams
for a time.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.746

Nah. Nah, I don't talk too much.

54:43.410 --> 54:48.154
to tell everyone that we'll
never leave this place again.

54:48.328 --> 54:50.809
Or we'll die here,
to the last one.

54:50.983 --> 54:52.419
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [tribe murmurs in agreement]

55:08.740 --> 55:09.741
Switch.

55:17.662 --> 55:19.272
[Mollie crying, groaning]

55:20.708 --> 55:24.625
Hey, Mollie. Mollie,
words can't express my grief,

55:24.799 --> 55:27.106
but she's with the Lord now.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.760
She's with the Lord.[sniffles]

55:30.196 --> 55:32.241
- [sawing]
- [cries]

55:34.243 --> 55:37.246
[Chief Paul Red Eagle]
And they even come here now
to marry our young women.

55:37.421 --> 55:38.813
[tribe murmurs]

55:38.987 --> 55:40.772
I employ some of them.

55:40.946 --> 55:44.210
They say they are my friends,
but I don't think
they really are.

55:44.384 --> 55:46.299
[Chief Bonnicastle] <i>Some of them
don't even pretend to work.</i>

55:46.473 --> 55:48.475
<i>They walk around,
they act like
they own the place.</i>

55:48.649 --> 55:50.825
- Okay, gentlemen.
Hold still, please.
- We got it!

55:50.999 --> 55:55.090
I mean, these people are bums,
<i>nee-shdah-heh,</i> common vags.

55:56.135 --> 55:59.704
We can't turn to the county
to help us.

56:00.922 --> 56:04.535
We can't go
to the state of Oklahoma
to help us.

56:05.623 --> 56:07.886
Why have we ever even thought
they would?

56:08.887 --> 56:10.845
We were here before them.

56:11.019 --> 56:12.717
This is our homeland we came to.

56:12.891 --> 56:14.762
Yeah. Yeah.

56:14.936 --> 56:18.157
Why we put our children here
is because Mother Earth
allowed us here.

56:18.331 --> 56:19.898
- Yeah.
- [tribe murmurs]

56:20.072 --> 56:23.815
No one takes us off this earth
until God calls us all home.

56:23.989 --> 56:24.990
Yeah.

56:25.164 --> 56:26.818
And we've got to realize that,

56:26.992 --> 56:29.168
but we've also got to realize
this evil that's come here.

56:29.342 --> 56:31.170
You have something it wants.

56:31.344 --> 56:34.478
- Yeah.
- It didn't want you when we was
coming through genocides,

56:34.652 --> 56:36.567
our coming home.

56:36.741 --> 56:40.701
But now we put
the original 25 families
together in this room.

56:40.875 --> 56:41.789
- [tribe murmurs]
- Yeah.

56:41.963 --> 56:43.835
And we're here to go with you.

56:44.009 --> 56:48.535
The old saying says is that--
that Osage is dying
by the enemy.

56:48.709 --> 56:52.887
Do not let them die alone.
You go join them.

56:53.061 --> 56:56.804
So we can go to heaven
knowing we're still warriors.

56:56.978 --> 57:02.506
We have to change,
but before we do, we need to be
like a fire on this earth

57:02.680 --> 57:06.248
and get rid of all that stops
or gets in front of us.

57:06.423 --> 57:09.600
My council, I ask you
for your support.

57:09.774 --> 57:14.822
All of you men.
And our women, these mothers,
these <i>ee-nahn</i> here.

57:14.996 --> 57:18.130
All of our elders
have come through
this landscape,

57:18.304 --> 57:22.090
and we-- only thing we know
is that we have each other.

57:23.004 --> 57:26.181
We have a Lord
that's been good to us.

57:26.355 --> 57:29.837
And this-- this other--
We never prayed
for the great life.

57:30.011 --> 57:32.144
We just prayed for life.

57:32.318 --> 57:34.581
And that's what
I'm gonna be praying for now,

57:34.755 --> 57:37.715
is that we get that life
for these kids coming.

57:37.889 --> 57:39.847
And, see, our days are over.

57:40.892 --> 57:43.460
We're just barely
living out a sundown,

57:43.634 --> 57:46.071
but their days are starting.

57:46.245 --> 57:50.031
And I want 'em to be Osages,
just like the gift
that Grandma gave me,

57:50.205 --> 57:52.643
just like the gift
that Grandma gave you.

57:52.817 --> 57:54.427
[tribe murmurs in agreement]

57:54.601 --> 57:56.342
Thank you, Chief.

57:56.516 --> 57:59.998
I would like to add
a thousand dollars
to that reward money...

58:00.172 --> 58:01.652
[tribe murmurs]

58:01.826 --> 58:05.873
...for any information
about these murders.

58:06.047 --> 58:10.269
That means if anyone
knows anything about it,
you must come to me.

58:11.531 --> 58:15.230
You all know where I am.
I'm easy to find.

58:15.404 --> 58:16.841
[Chief Bonnicastle]
Thank you, Mr. Hale.

58:17.015 --> 58:18.930
Your friendship has always been
greatly appreciated.

58:19.104 --> 58:23.325
I'll do anything, anything,
to help the Osage
in their plight,

58:23.500 --> 58:25.284
in their vale of tears.

58:25.458 --> 58:29.288
I move that we send
Mr. Barney McBride
to Washington, D.C.

58:29.462 --> 58:30.463
I will second that.

58:30.637 --> 58:32.857
Mr. McBride, Mrs. McBride.

58:33.031 --> 58:34.772
Yes, Chief. I'm here.

58:34.946 --> 58:38.297
Resolution 23.
Mr. McBride will travel
to Washington, D.C.

58:38.471 --> 58:40.342
to meet with
the Indian Affairs Commission,

58:40.517 --> 58:44.346
where he will ask
for private investigators
and additional police

58:44.521 --> 58:46.958
so that they can look into
this matter of all this death.

58:47.132 --> 58:48.133
Do you accept this?

58:48.307 --> 58:49.351
Yes, I do.

58:49.526 --> 58:51.528
[tribe murmurs in approval]

58:59.579 --> 59:01.581
Bill. Reta.

59:02.451 --> 59:03.627
How are you, Ernest?

59:04.541 --> 59:08.719
So you're, uh--
you're here now, huh?

59:08.893 --> 59:11.286
Reta was a comfort to me
when Minnie died.

59:31.480 --> 59:34.832
[softly] Hey, listen.
Leave the jewels be
on this one, all right?

59:35.006 --> 59:37.312
Oh, I-- I do it
so nobody notices.

59:37.486 --> 59:41.621
No, no. Come on, Frank.
Just-- just leave it be,
just this one time, for me.

59:41.795 --> 59:45.190
It's my wife's sister,
all right?[sighs] There.

59:45.973 --> 59:47.932
$25 for a hearse rental?

59:48.933 --> 59:53.851
Uh-- $1,650 for-for
a mahogany casket?

59:55.069 --> 59:57.855
You charging me Osage prices.
You think I'm thick, huh?

59:58.029 --> 59:59.857
No, everybody pays the same.

01:00:00.031 --> 01:00:03.687
Come on, now.
McAllister's entire funeral
wasn't more than 300.

01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:05.427
This here--
This here's 2,000, Frank.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.604
McAllister's daughter
was just a youngster.

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:10.607
I'll tell you what.
I'ma talk to King Hale
about this.

01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:12.434
See what he has to say.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.915
Well, if you want her
in a wooden box,
I'll put her in one.

01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:18.832
I-- I don't want no wooden box,
all right? You are charging me
Osage prices.

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:21.922
Your wife even said
she wanted an open casket.

01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:24.403
[whispers] But there's no face.

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:28.625
There's no face, Frank.
Why would she want it open, huh?

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:30.801
You trying to steal our money?
Is that what you're trying--

01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:32.019
It ain't--

01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:34.500
It ain't your money.

01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:38.373
It's easy for you
to get me more money
and pay my bill.

01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:41.072
I work for my money.

01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:45.642
Just like the good Lord says,
you sow and reap, Ernest.

01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:49.210
When was the last time
you've seen one of them
Osages working, huh?

01:00:50.472 --> 01:00:53.127
[executor]
Well, your sister, Anna,
leaves an estate

01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:56.348
of approximately $100,000

01:00:56.522 --> 01:01:02.006
to be willed
to your mother, Lizzie Q.,
and you, Mollie, and you, Reta.

01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:07.359
You know, I was thinking,
that is a substantial
amount of money.

01:01:07.533 --> 01:01:10.623
I heard that Tall Chief hired
the Emmett Miller minstrel show

01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:12.886
to come in and play
for his birthday party,

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:18.326
and I thought, "Why-- Why
couldn't we do something
like that with this money?"

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.765
Maybe have a party
for the town, and maybe
invite another band out.

01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:24.637
[Mollie] <i>It does not do
to talk to this man.</i>

01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:28.772
<i>Evil surrounds my heart.</i>

01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:31.644
<i>Many times, I cry,</i>

01:01:31.818 --> 01:01:35.300
<i>and this evil around my heart
comes out of my eyes.</i>

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:42.524
<i>I close my heart
and keep what is good there,</i>

01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:45.179
<i>but hate comes.</i>

01:01:47.138 --> 01:01:50.707
<i>And they say
I ought to kill these white men
who killed my family.</i>

01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:58.018
Mrs. Burkhart. Bill Burns.
I solve crimes.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.325
This is my card.

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:02.806
My address is New York,
London, Paris,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.896
Montreal, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Cairo, Berlin, Boston

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:07.854
and wherever else
a law-abiding citizen...

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.291
[lodge concierge]
Mr. Barney McBride?[Barney] Yes.

01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:12.511
[lodge concierge]
Telegram for you, sir.
Just arrived.

01:02:33.532 --> 01:02:34.751
[grunts]

01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:39.843
- [screaming, grunting]
- [assailants grunting]

01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:43.324
[Burns]
...hasn't been to Anna's place
to corroborate Byron's story.

01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:47.154
Now, I stopped by there,
and I did find
her alligator purse,

01:02:47.328 --> 01:02:50.331
which could suggest
that Byron is not lying.
He brought her home.

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:54.422
Well, my--
my brother's not a liar.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:01.038
Uh, your youngest sister,
Minnie, who died of the wasting
illness two years ago,

01:03:01.212 --> 01:03:03.301
she was married
to a "Bill Smith."

01:03:03.475 --> 01:03:05.433
Yes.

01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:09.698
And that is the same
Bill Smith currently married
to your sister, Reta.

01:03:10.264 --> 01:03:11.222
Yes.

01:03:11.396 --> 01:03:13.702
[sighs] Same Bill Smith.

01:03:15.226 --> 01:03:17.315
Two sisters.

01:03:17.489 --> 01:03:23.060
<i>Mr. Smith, he is a busy fellow,
talking around town,</i>

01:03:23.234 --> 01:03:25.802
<i>conducting his own investigation
into Anna's death.</i>

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:27.673
Much obliged, Sheriff.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank y'all again.

01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:28.935
Appreciate it.

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:30.632
[Burns] <i>Were you aware of that?</i>

01:03:32.547 --> 01:03:34.027
You were?

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.073
Yes.

01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:39.903
Now, you went straight
to Mollie's house?

01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:41.295
[driver] We didn't
go straight there.

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:42.819
Where'd you go?

01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:45.082
Graveyard out past Florer's.

01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:48.520
She wanted to look at her land,
then she wanted to visit
her father.

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.305
[Anna] Mm-mmm,
I cannot see my daddy

01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:53.742
with my hair
flying everywhere.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:56.136
Did you know I was gonna have
a little baby? [chuckles]

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.574
- Oh, my goodness, no.
- Oh, it's true.

01:03:59.748 --> 01:04:02.055
[sighs] I'm gonna name her
Minnie too.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.237
Give Minnie my love.

01:04:13.284 --> 01:04:15.112
Did you know
that Anna was pregnant?

01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:21.553
Anna?

01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:24.034
Yes.

01:04:25.339 --> 01:04:27.428
[breathes shakily]

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:31.519
Anna was pregnant.

01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:33.521
She was pregnant.

01:04:34.435 --> 01:04:35.436
Did he say Byron?

01:04:37.221 --> 01:04:38.265
No.

01:04:40.137 --> 01:04:41.138
Me?

01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:45.316
No. No.

01:04:46.404 --> 01:04:49.015
Well, you make sure
we steer clear of that.

01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:55.108
Mr. Smith says that
he has a pretty good idea
who killed your sister.

01:04:56.196 --> 01:04:58.720
He says that he will tell all

01:04:59.504 --> 01:05:00.984
when he has the true facts.

01:05:02.115 --> 01:05:06.163
So what, uh--
What's he found out?

01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:08.339
I just don't know that part yet.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.471
What's he found out?

01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:12.604
Nothing.

01:05:14.258 --> 01:05:15.912
I'll go see Blackie.

01:05:20.612 --> 01:05:22.396
On that, what we talked about...

01:05:23.093 --> 01:05:24.050
About it, yeah.

01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:25.834
To see what he may say on that.

01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:27.749
That's right.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.099
[Blackie grunts]

01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:33.407
[Blackie groans]

01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:38.935
[Blackie] Ah, yeah. Yeah! Boy,
we gonna be rich tonight, boy!

01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:43.548
- [outlaw] Ernest.
- Where's Blackie?

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:48.901
- That's it, huh?
- Yeah.

01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:49.989
[Ernest grunts]

01:05:50.163 --> 01:05:51.338
[Ernest] Osage graves.

01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:52.818
That's disgusting work,
right there.

01:05:52.992 --> 01:05:55.125
It's dirty. It's real dirty.

01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:58.780
You want something
to pay big, Blackie, hmm?

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.869
You can't be working
with them trouble boys.

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:04.090
You gotta use your head.
You gotta think, Blackie.

01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:07.311
Hale, he's been--
He's been talking
about us partnering up.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.878
Hmm.

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:13.273
You know Bill Smith? He's--
He's been going around town
talking a lot.

01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:20.193
Now, if someone were
to knock off Bill Smith
and-- and Reta too, right?

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:25.198
If she was gone,
all that estate money would go
to my mother-in-law, Lizzie Q.,

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:27.026
and she wills it to my children.

01:06:28.201 --> 01:06:31.639
Now, that's a good deal, that.
It's a real good deal.

01:06:31.813 --> 01:06:33.337
- For you, it is.
- Mm-mmm.

01:06:33.511 --> 01:06:34.816
For all.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.993
Smith and her,
they're gone a lot from home.

01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:39.082
All you gotta do is
go down there, and you plant
the stand in the house.

01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:41.606
And when they come in...
[clicks tongue] ...you get 'em.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.479
They got-- Reta's got
three or four diamonds.
She got some ear screws.

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:47.699
Bill Smith, he always carries
two or three hundred
in his pocket.

01:06:47.873 --> 01:06:50.049
You could have that.

01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:54.053
You could have that,
and-- and I know Hale would
pay you a thousand for the job.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.622
That sound like
a good one to you, Blackie?

01:06:59.537 --> 01:07:00.581
Hmm.

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:04.977
You know my little
Buick roadster?

01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:06.979
You know, the red one
you always got your eye on.

01:07:07.153 --> 01:07:08.850
Yeah?

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.331
[Ernest] <i>How about I throw in
my Buick roadster?</i>

01:07:11.505 --> 01:07:13.594
<i>It's insured more
than it's worth.</i>

01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:16.467
<i>Now, I'd get
the insurance money,
and you'd get the Buick.</i>

01:07:17.859 --> 01:07:20.688
That-- that's just
a little side deal
between me and you.

01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:22.951
Hale doesn't need to know
about that one.

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:25.128
But that's real generous.

01:07:25.302 --> 01:07:27.608
Goddamn, you're a greedy Jew, Ernest.

01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:32.048
Well, I just love money.

01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:36.226
It's true. It's true.
I damn near love it
as much as I love my wife.

01:07:40.926 --> 01:07:42.232
[Mollie] Ernest?

01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:43.624
Yeah.

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:45.670
Come here.

01:07:51.328 --> 01:07:52.416
What is it, huh?

01:07:54.853 --> 01:07:56.724
Feeling better
than this morning, huh?

01:07:56.898 --> 01:07:58.465
A little.

01:07:58.639 --> 01:08:03.775
Yeah. You just--
You just need sleep,
I tell you, hmm?

01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:06.038
Sleep.
That's the first thing now.

01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:09.520
I don't sleep anymore.

01:08:09.694 --> 01:08:15.395
I know. I know. Just-- Just try.
You try to get some rest,
all right?

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:17.093
Come on, now.

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.622
I don't even know
if you love me anymore.

01:08:24.796 --> 01:08:28.234
Mollie, of course I love you.

01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:31.672
I need you here.

01:08:32.717 --> 01:08:38.026
I'm right here, Mollie.
I am right here.

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:42.683
I love you.

01:08:52.258 --> 01:08:53.694
[speaks Osage]

01:09:12.757 --> 01:09:14.367
[chuckles]

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.891
[in English]
Oh, you gonna try
to wake the kids up now.

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.419
You gonna wake the kids up.

01:09:22.593 --> 01:09:23.898
[chuckling][chuckling, shushing]

01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:26.031
Yeah. Yeah.[shushes]

01:09:30.035 --> 01:09:33.995
[doctor] <i>They're calling it
"insulin." It's from Toronto
and costs dearly.</i>

01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:38.043
<i>There ain't
more than five people
that can afford it.</i>

01:09:38.217 --> 01:09:42.526
It ain't officially
for sale yet, but Bill Hale
has seen to it for you.

01:09:43.527 --> 01:09:45.050
[Ernest]
Did you hear that, sweetheart?

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:48.140
This one.[Martha] This one.

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:50.664
It's from a cow's pancreas.

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:55.103
It'll come down to us
- once a week.
- Mmm.

01:09:56.235 --> 01:09:57.410
Look at that.

01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:02.415
Wow. A cow's pancreas.

01:10:03.503 --> 01:10:06.332
Diabetes can be
- an awful misery.
- Mmm.

01:10:07.638 --> 01:10:09.988
Have you eaten
- in the last hour?
- No.

01:10:10.162 --> 01:10:11.816
Lift your blouse, please.

01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:13.600
There you go.

01:10:13.774 --> 01:10:15.733
Have you had
anything to drink?[sighs]

01:10:15.907 --> 01:10:19.084
Goat's milk. Hotcakes.

01:10:19.258 --> 01:10:22.566
[mutters softly in Osage][speaks Osage, chuckles]

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:26.874
[in English] Well,
she's had, uh-- taffy
and bacon too. Go on. Tell 'em.

01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:28.876
[speaks Osage][in English]
You gotta tell 'em.

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:32.097
If you don't stop eating sweets,
this won't matter.

01:10:32.271 --> 01:10:35.405
You will lose
your feet, or worse,
if you eat like a white.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:37.233
Hear that?

01:10:39.844 --> 01:10:41.411
[inhales sharply]
It's all right.

01:10:43.413 --> 01:10:44.501
Goddamn it.

01:10:44.675 --> 01:10:46.329
[vehicle approaches]

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.331
[police officer 1]
Hey, Blackie, stop![officer 2] Blackie!

01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:49.767
[Blackie] Oh, shit.[officer 2] Stop!

01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.899
[officer 1] Goddamn it, Blackie!
Stop running!

01:10:52.073 --> 01:10:53.771
Where are you
- gonna go to?
- You gotta catch me first!

01:10:53.945 --> 01:10:56.034
Ooh, look at that.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.731
[chuckles]

01:10:57.905 --> 01:10:59.298
[horn honking]

01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:03.041
[horn honking]

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.045
Hey there.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.484
You brought the Buick out, huh?

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.835
Get in. Get in.

01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:18.056
[Ernest grunts, clears throat]

01:11:34.638 --> 01:11:35.639
[Ernest chuckles]

01:11:36.814 --> 01:11:37.815
Byron.

01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:40.296
Brother, come here.

01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:45.692
- Here?
- Yeah, right there.

01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:50.828
Kneel, please, Ernest.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:53.309
Kneel.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.748
[Ernest grunts]

01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.364
Did you make a deal
with Blackie Thompson

01:12:05.538 --> 01:12:08.976
to steal your red roadster
and cash the insurance?

01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:13.024
[clicks tongue] Um...

01:12:14.982 --> 01:12:16.027
I, um...

01:12:18.029 --> 01:12:19.509
Yes, I did.

01:12:19.683 --> 01:12:23.687
Well, Blackie's been arrested
for stealing your car.

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:26.080
What were you supposed to do?

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:32.826
I was-- I was supposed
to feel him out on, uh--
on Bill and Reta.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.612
So who takes care of Bill Smith
and his blanket now?

01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:38.789
[stammers] I--Hmm?

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:40.965
I don't know, sir.

01:12:43.663 --> 01:12:44.882
Remove the book.

01:12:45.535 --> 01:12:46.536
[Ernest] I...

01:12:52.063 --> 01:12:53.586
I'm sorry.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.328
All right, Brother. Stand up.
[clears throat]

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:57.982
[Hale] Stand up.

01:13:01.942 --> 01:13:03.204
Elbows on the table.

01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:22.006
I'm a 32nd degree Mason.

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.095
I am imbued

01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:30.144

trust and responsibility,
among other things.

01:13:31.102 --> 01:13:32.146
Yes, sir.

01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:33.974
You know what that is?

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.977
No, sir.

01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:39.371
[shouts] Shit!

01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:40.894
[breathes deeply]

[grunts, groans]

01:13:48.032 --> 01:13:49.076
Damn.

01:13:49.816 --> 01:13:51.035
[Ernest sighs]

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:53.820
Now get up! Sit over there.

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:08.792
Are you challenged
to lead your house?

01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:12.665
Mm-mmm. No.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.234
She's hired
a private investigator

01:14:17.322 --> 01:14:20.020
who noses and brings
unwanted eyes.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:26.374
She got the tribal council
to pay for Barney McBride's
trip to Washington.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.901
- I know.
- She's a very
hard-headed woman

01:14:31.075 --> 01:14:33.033
and she's gonna make it
harder on you!

01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:37.211
I'm sorry, King.
You know she's just--
she's just stubborn.

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:41.215
Ernest, handsome son,

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:46.699
what do you think's gonna happen
to Mollie a-and all of them?

01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:49.659
I love 'em,
but in the turning
of the earth,

01:14:50.398 --> 01:14:51.617
they're gonna go.

01:14:52.618 --> 01:14:54.228
Their time is over.

01:14:54.968 --> 01:14:57.144
That's it. Gone.

01:14:57.318 --> 01:15:01.192
Ernest, there will be
no lightning strike
and it stops happening.

01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:03.063
It will happen.

01:15:04.717 --> 01:15:07.024
These headrights
must go to Mollie,

01:15:07.198 --> 01:15:11.463
not to the mother,
not to the sister, Reta,
not Bill Smith.

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:13.639
Yes, sir.

01:15:13.813 --> 01:15:16.512
You've got to take back control
of your home.

01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:22.735
Now, you hear me, hmm?

01:15:24.694 --> 01:15:26.086
- Yes, King.
- Hmm.

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:38.229

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.808
<i>Is that gold, Henry?</i>

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:38.332
Better than gold.
It's recognition.

01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:40.552
Now, Henry,

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:42.772
what I need is someone
who can do a job,

01:16:42.946 --> 01:16:46.384
someone who can take
a proposition to do
an old man and his blanket.

01:16:46.558 --> 01:16:49.779
And I just don't want any man.
I need someone
who can do it right.

01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:52.782
'Cause I need them both to go
at the same time.

01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:55.654
So it can't be poison whiskey
or something like that.

01:16:55.828 --> 01:16:58.265
- It's gotta be foolproof.
- Mmm.

01:17:00.746 --> 01:17:02.356
- Hey, John?
- Yeah.

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:05.708
Take this on up the house,
stash it for me.

01:17:05.882 --> 01:17:07.274
Don't let Maggie see it.

01:17:07.448 --> 01:17:09.755
Oh, now, she got eyes, Henry.

01:17:09.929 --> 01:17:12.062
She caught me last time,
and I don't want that woman--

01:17:12.236 --> 01:17:13.150
Give it to me.

01:17:14.281 --> 01:17:16.806
Why don't y'all just go talk
to Blackie Thompson?

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.722
- [chuckles] Well...
- Blackie? Mmm.

01:17:19.896 --> 01:17:22.942
Well, he's, uh-- He's in--
in a penitentiary right now.

01:17:23.116 --> 01:17:24.291
Tell him why.

01:17:24.465 --> 01:17:26.076
Um... [sighs]

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.645
Well, I messed up and, uh...

01:17:29.819 --> 01:17:30.776
Go on. You tell him.

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.778
'Cause he had a harebrained idea

01:17:32.952 --> 01:17:35.781
to get him nabbed
on insurance money on his car.

01:17:35.955 --> 01:17:38.523
- That's bad luck. [chuckles]
- I'll say.

01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:42.092
There's Dick Gregg.

01:17:42.266 --> 01:17:45.922
No. Dick's wanted in Arkansas.

01:17:47.314 --> 01:17:49.316
Hell, he's wanted in Kansas.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.667
Son of a bitch is so hid,
he can't even find himself.

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:52.972
[chuckles]

01:17:55.627 --> 01:17:57.107
You need a yegg man...

01:17:59.283 --> 01:18:01.111
somebody,
if youse want explosives,

01:18:01.285 --> 01:18:04.592
who'd make damn sure
you get in there
and get them both, same time.

01:18:05.506 --> 01:18:07.552
Soup under the house.

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:10.773
Nitro or dynamite.

01:18:11.599 --> 01:18:13.297
Blow 'em up.

01:18:16.213 --> 01:18:18.694
I think that'd be Acie Kirby.

01:18:18.868 --> 01:18:20.783
- Acie?
- [Grammer] Oh, yeah.

01:18:20.957 --> 01:18:22.828
- Where's he at?
- I don't really know.

01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:24.351
He's pretty squirrelly.

01:18:24.525 --> 01:18:26.049
The son of a bitch right there
might though.

01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:28.834
- Hey, John?
- Yeah.

01:18:29.008 --> 01:18:31.707
Where's Acie Kirby hiding out
these days?

01:18:31.881 --> 01:18:36.320
I don't rightly know.
Hiding out in his old hole
somewhere, I suspect.

01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:38.365
Why don't you take
your skinny ass
up to the barn,

01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:40.933
see if you can find a shovel
and go dig him up?

01:18:41.107 --> 01:18:43.196
Mmm. Now?

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:46.069
All right. I'll ask around,
see if I can find him.

01:18:51.378 --> 01:18:52.728
Acie Kirby.

01:19:02.563 --> 01:19:05.044
Acie. That's your man.

01:19:26.413 --> 01:19:27.458
Ready?

01:19:29.503 --> 01:19:30.635
Come on.

01:19:32.637 --> 01:19:34.595
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Mrs. Burkhart.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.597
Set up right here. All right.

01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:45.563
[Mollie] Tsk, tsk.

01:19:51.656 --> 01:19:55.268

have to ask you to just
step outside for me a minute...

01:20:19.902 --> 01:20:22.382
[stammers]
...while I speak to my wife.

01:20:22.556 --> 01:20:23.906
- Outside?
- Of course, Ernest.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.081
Just for a minute.

01:20:30.695 --> 01:20:31.827
[door closes]

01:20:32.349 --> 01:20:33.829

[speaks Osage][scoffs, speaks Osage]

01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:43.708

the shots and the insulin.

01:20:43.882 --> 01:20:47.755

01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:58.636

01:21:00.768 --> 01:21:01.900
[door slams]

01:21:04.033 --> 01:21:07.340
So, fellas, uh,
just give me that.
I'm gonna go ahead and do it.

01:21:07.514 --> 01:21:09.255
You're administering the shot?

01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:10.909
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:12.911
Ernest,
Bill Hale has entrusted us
with this care.

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:16.088
I know, I know.
It's just the way
it's going right now, all right?

01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:18.264
[David Shoun]
We're still gonna have to
charge you for this visit.

01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:20.788
We made the trip out here.
Gas, time...

01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:23.879
Fuck a duck.
You're gonna charge me
for this robbery? Is that it?

01:21:24.357 --> 01:21:26.011
It's only right.

01:21:26.185 --> 01:21:27.795
Give me that.

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:31.538
I'll get it back to you.
Go on now. Get outta here.
Go on.

01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:35.064
Goddamn it.

01:21:39.546 --> 01:21:40.591
There you go.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:45.857
Made me send the doctors away.
The doctors. [scoffs]

01:21:46.031 --> 01:21:48.425
What, am I a doctor?
Are you a doctor?

01:21:48.599 --> 01:21:50.862
Stupid, stubborn bitch ought
to let them men do their work.

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:52.995
That's what you should do--[speaks Osage]

01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:54.431
[in English]
So I'm the doctor now?

01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:56.433
I'm the doctor and the nurse

01:21:56.607 --> 01:21:59.349
and the housekeeper, babysitter,
God knows what else all, right?

01:21:59.523 --> 01:22:00.872
It's not helping.

01:22:02.439 --> 01:22:03.614
It's not any good.

01:22:04.528 --> 01:22:07.096
King Hale has gifted this
to you.

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:08.619
He has gifted this. You--

01:22:08.793 --> 01:22:10.708
Five people in the whole world
are getting this,

01:22:10.882 --> 01:22:12.710
and you're one of them, Mollie.

01:22:12.884 --> 01:22:15.931
You're one of the lucky ones.
Think of the children.

01:22:16.105 --> 01:22:18.063
That's gonna save your life
right there.

01:22:19.412 --> 01:22:21.414
But no, no, you think
you know everything, right?

01:22:21.588 --> 01:22:23.634
With your--
With your Indian ways.

01:22:23.808 --> 01:22:26.419
You think
you're gonna get better
with all them medicine men

01:22:26.593 --> 01:22:28.508
and all them roots and all them
herbs and all the...

01:22:28.682 --> 01:22:31.381
[whooping] All that horseshit?

01:22:31.555 --> 01:22:33.035
You ain't, Mollie!

01:22:33.774 --> 01:22:35.820
That's real medicine!

01:22:45.656 --> 01:22:49.094
You think-- [stammers] You think
someone's gonna hurt you?

01:22:49.268 --> 01:22:51.967
You think-- You think
I'm gonna hurt you?

01:22:54.882 --> 01:22:56.493
You don't say nothing to that?

01:23:05.763 --> 01:23:07.243
[speaks Osage]

01:23:31.136 --> 01:23:33.660
[in English]
Give it a chance now, all right?

01:23:35.662 --> 01:23:39.710
Maybe it's gotta get worse
before it gets better, Mollie.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:46.064
I am to take care of you.

01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:50.373
No one...
No one is gonna hurt you
when I'm in front.

01:24:11.307 --> 01:24:14.353
[James Shoun] Open. Ah.[Henry] Ah.

01:24:14.527 --> 01:24:16.051
How are you feeling, Henry?

01:24:16.225 --> 01:24:19.054
Good.
Well, sometimes I feel sad.

01:24:19.228 --> 01:24:21.186
That's not a health issue
for us.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.190
Oh, he's fit as a fiddle.
Come on, Henry,
he's healthy as a horse.

01:24:25.364 --> 01:24:29.020
That he is, Bill.
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna kill this Indian?

01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:30.326
How'd you know?

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.633
[laughs] Better watch out.

01:24:33.807 --> 01:24:35.287
[imitates gunshot]

01:24:35.461 --> 01:24:37.594
Well, no,
he just needs to be insured,
that's all.

01:24:37.768 --> 01:24:39.552
It's just a formality,
but he needs it.

01:24:39.726 --> 01:24:41.380
Well, what about my melancholy?

01:24:41.554 --> 01:24:43.469
A little whiskey can help that.

01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:46.733
You better watch out.

01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:50.868
I don't know, Bill.
It may not look very good.

01:24:51.651 --> 01:24:53.566
It's hard to justify this one.

01:24:54.872 --> 01:24:56.482
He owes me a lot of money.

01:24:58.441 --> 01:25:00.791
Bill, my guardian won't give me
what's mine.

01:25:00.965 --> 01:25:01.966
What do you need?

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.794
I wanna buy some moonshine.

01:25:03.968 --> 01:25:05.883
No, no, Henry.
You don't need that stuff.
It's hurting you.

01:25:06.057 --> 01:25:07.058
Doctor said I should use it.

01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:08.668
I don't care what he says.

01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:10.366
He don't know what the hell
he's talking about.

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.802
- Come on, Henry.
- Hi, Pearl.

01:25:11.976 --> 01:25:14.283
- My wife's on Roy Bunch.
- What?

01:25:14.457 --> 01:25:16.241
My wife's on Roy Bunch.

01:25:16.415 --> 01:25:18.156
Who cares about Roy Bunch?

01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:20.419
You got women
all over you, my friend.
You're lucky with that.

01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:24.728
And be at peace
with what you have.
And don't do anything stupid.

01:25:24.902 --> 01:25:25.990
I wanna hurt myself.

01:25:26.164 --> 01:25:27.905
That's not a man's way out.

01:25:28.079 --> 01:25:29.907
A man's to get what's his.
They won't give that to me.

01:25:30.081 --> 01:25:32.431
A wife's to give respect.
I don't wanna be here anymore.

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:35.782
I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed
to be an Osage Indian.

01:25:35.956 --> 01:25:38.437
Just give me some moonshine
or get me a gun.

01:25:38.611 --> 01:25:41.266
Now, Henry-- Now, Henry,
you have a good time with Pearl.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.225
Don't you do anything stupid,
you hear?

01:25:43.399 --> 01:25:46.097
I need you, my friend.
I need you.

01:25:52.756 --> 01:25:55.193
Henry, no!
What you doing here, Henry?
Henry, no.

01:25:57.978 --> 01:25:59.893
[Henry] What do you think
- you're doing?
- Henry, stop it!

01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:01.939
Think you can touch
- my wife?
- Get him off me!

01:26:02.113 --> 01:26:03.375
You stay off my wife!

01:26:03.549 --> 01:26:06.248
You stay off my wife!
You stay off my wife!

01:26:06.422 --> 01:26:08.337
I've done nothing to you.[Henry] You're the--

01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:11.514
I'm tired of asking
friends for things
when I can pay my own way.

01:26:11.688 --> 01:26:13.603
[bank manager] Henry, you've got
to bring your guardian.

01:26:13.777 --> 01:26:15.822
Who tells you how to spend
your own money?

01:26:15.996 --> 01:26:17.824
Just stop, Henry.

01:26:17.998 --> 01:26:19.826
My ancestors had a free life
before you got off
your stinky boats.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.741
[Hale speaks Osage][Henry shouts in Osage]

01:26:21.915 --> 01:26:23.917
[in English] You think
you're better than me, huh?

01:26:24.091 --> 01:26:26.137
- Think you're better than me?
- [Hale] Come on.

01:26:26.311 --> 01:26:29.358
I told you not to do
anything stupid. You went
and hit Roy Bunch. Come on.

01:26:29.532 --> 01:26:32.535
I knocked him down,
Reverend Hale.
I knocked him down.

01:26:33.927 --> 01:26:34.972
[Ernest grunts]

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.063
[breathes heavily]

01:26:39.803 --> 01:26:41.283
Why do you take care of him?

01:26:41.457 --> 01:26:43.067
'Cause he's a melancholic.

01:26:44.373 --> 01:26:46.462
You know he tried
to do away with himself
last year?

01:26:47.245 --> 01:26:48.159
Oh, yeah?

01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:49.769
I take care of that man

01:26:49.943 --> 01:26:52.076
because he's my neighbor
and he's my best friend.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.775
That's $25,000 laying there.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.126
I got an insurance policy
on him.

01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:01.520
It's against what he owes me.

01:27:01.694 --> 01:27:05.437
So, if he succeeds
in demising himself before
the end of the year, I forfeit.

01:27:05.611 --> 01:27:07.091
Hmm.

01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:09.702
So, he needs to stay alive
at least a few more months.

01:27:12.139 --> 01:27:14.446
I might even get a chance
at his headrights.

01:27:16.927 --> 01:27:18.668
Something you should know...

01:27:19.451 --> 01:27:21.366
[Ernest] Hmm?

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:24.761
Mollie's first husband
is that man right there
on the floor.

01:27:25.762 --> 01:27:26.893
[scoffs]

01:27:28.155 --> 01:27:29.896
What do you mean,
"first husband"?

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:31.985
Osage, they don't divorce.

01:27:32.159 --> 01:27:37.904
And they were.
They were married in a ceremony
on the reservation.

01:27:38.078 --> 01:27:41.473
What do you mean?
You-- She-- You mean,
she's still married to him?

01:27:41.647 --> 01:27:45.085
No, no. They were 15.
It's traditional.
Doesn't mean anything--

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:49.046
If I was married,
I'd be telling her that.
She didn't tell me that.

01:27:50.439 --> 01:27:51.875
How's she treatin' you?

01:27:53.659 --> 01:27:57.097
She treats me just fine.
She's a good one, you know.

01:27:58.185 --> 01:28:00.536
Well, you let her have
her secrets.

01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:03.278
That way, you have yours.

<i>Is there anyone?</i>

01:30:56.059 --> 01:30:57.626
Pitts Beaty's trying
to get his Klan

01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.454
to find the killers
who killed Anna.

01:31:01.281 --> 01:31:06.896
He said they're...
they're helping to take
the lazy men away from town.

01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:11.378
Well, Pitts and his Klan are
trying to have authority here,
and they have none.

01:31:11.553 --> 01:31:14.294
They need to let the police
do their job.

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:17.384
I'm very disapproving
of the Ku Klux Klan, Mollie.

01:31:17.559 --> 01:31:19.474
They're very hungry for a power.

01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:23.129
- And they ain't gonna get it.
- Hmm.

01:31:24.914 --> 01:31:26.350
Is there anyone?

- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:32:00.863 --> 01:32:02.734
Seems that way, King.
Seems that way.

01:32:02.908 --> 01:32:04.475
Seems that way.[Hale] Mm-hmm.

01:32:04.649 --> 01:32:06.782
I think we should be
a little more considerate

01:32:06.956 --> 01:32:10.002
about how we spend
Mollie's money, Ernest.

01:32:10.176 --> 01:32:13.049
I don't mean that
as a criticism,
I'm just saying.

01:32:13.223 --> 01:32:15.051
You bought a farm.[Ernest] Yeah.

01:32:15.225 --> 01:32:17.183
Okay. You didn't consult me.

01:32:17.357 --> 01:32:20.099
Maybe you should've consulted me
because I'm there for you, Ernest.

01:32:20.273 --> 01:32:21.710
I'm there for both of you.

01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:24.451
You met Mollie because of me.

01:32:24.626 --> 01:32:26.497
You're here because of me.

01:32:26.671 --> 01:32:31.502
Let me help you. Let me give you
my advice, my consultation.

01:32:31.676 --> 01:32:35.593
Judson, he didn't tell me
about a hog sickness
that was going on,

01:32:35.767 --> 01:32:40.555
but now--
I learned my lesson, King.
Won't happen again.

01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:44.297
Just a bad investment,
that's all. Bad investment.

01:32:47.736 --> 01:32:48.737
Mollie?

01:32:51.043 --> 01:32:53.785
There's something different
about you tonight. What is it?

01:32:59.356 --> 01:33:02.272
Uh... Well, now's a good a time
as any, so...

01:33:07.146 --> 01:33:09.192
- Mollie, she's pregnant.
- [Myrtle] What?

01:33:09.366 --> 01:33:10.759
- [Willie gasps] Oh!
- Oh!

01:33:10.933 --> 01:33:13.457
- Yeah.
- [Myrtle] Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my...

01:33:13.631 --> 01:33:15.198
Yeah? That so?

01:33:15.372 --> 01:33:16.416
[Ernest] Yeah.

01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:20.725
- [Willie laughs]
- [Myrtle chuckles]
Oh, my goodness.

01:33:20.899 --> 01:33:26.078
Yeah, we got the--
We got the news that
Mollie's having a baby, King.

01:33:26.252 --> 01:33:29.734
[Myrtle laughs] Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

01:33:29.908 --> 01:33:32.607
Blessings.
Blessings upon this house.

01:33:32.781 --> 01:33:34.609
- Wonderful. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:33:34.783 --> 01:33:35.697
[Hale] Bless you.

01:33:35.871 --> 01:33:37.481
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:33:37.655 --> 01:33:39.091
- [Myrtle] Congratulations.
- [Willie] Congrats.

01:33:39.265 --> 01:33:41.354
- [Ernest] Thank you.
- [Myrtle] Congratulations.

01:33:41.528 --> 01:33:42.747
[Ernest chuckles]

01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:44.531
[Myrtle] We are just thrilled.
[chuckles]

01:33:44.706 --> 01:33:46.533
[Mollie] Thank you, Willie.

01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:50.450
Henry! Oh, Henry.
Come on in here.
We just got some wonderful news.

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:54.629
Mollie is pregnant again.
[laughs]

01:33:54.803 --> 01:33:58.154
[Myrtle] I have a feeling
it's a girl. I am never wrong
about these things.

01:33:58.328 --> 01:33:59.764
[Henry] Congratulations.

01:33:59.938 --> 01:34:02.071
[Myrtle] I can feel it
in my bones.[speaks Osage]

01:34:02.245 --> 01:34:04.987
[Myrtle, in English]
...a baby quilt. We'll pick out
colors. We'll go to...

01:34:05.161 --> 01:34:07.119
Congratulations.[speaks Osage]

01:34:07.293 --> 01:34:09.252
[Myrtle] We'll go
to the dry goods store...

01:34:09.426 --> 01:34:10.906
[in English]
Sorry to bother you.

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.082
Uncle, I just need to have
some words with you, please.

01:34:13.256 --> 01:34:15.824
Of course, Henry.
You just go sit over there.
I'll be right there.

01:34:15.998 --> 01:34:17.216
I just gotta talk to them.

01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:19.349
You go.
- Wait for me there.
- Thank you.

01:34:27.531 --> 01:34:30.447
You been loving with her
in this sickness?

01:34:32.014 --> 01:34:38.716
[mutters] She's my wife, King.
It's, uh... That's what happens. Yeah.

01:34:41.284 --> 01:34:44.200
Mmm, maybe it's just
a "preversion" of yours.

01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:50.772
Yeah. God bless you
and the child.

01:34:54.514 --> 01:34:56.473
[no audible dialogue]

01:35:01.913 --> 01:35:03.349
First husband, huh?

01:35:05.612 --> 01:35:08.311
You think that means
he's got a claim on the family?

01:35:11.836 --> 01:35:14.143
[indistinct]

01:35:22.064 --> 01:35:23.065
[Hale] Henry.

01:35:23.805 --> 01:35:25.371
[Henry] Uncle.

01:35:25.545 --> 01:35:28.853
[Ernest] <i>Ramsey, I know
you're in bad way in this life.</i>

01:35:29.027 --> 01:35:32.727
Lots of kids. Seven or eight,
I heard.

01:35:32.901 --> 01:35:34.946
Yeah, I got a passel of 'em,
don't I?

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:39.603
King Bill Hale wants to know
if you'd like a job

01:35:40.343 --> 01:35:42.040
getting someone done.

01:35:42.214 --> 01:35:45.827
Oh, I can't do that.
I didn't sign on
for that kind of work.

01:35:47.045 --> 01:35:48.481
Well, it's an Indian.

01:35:49.874 --> 01:35:51.267
Now, that's different.

01:35:52.529 --> 01:35:53.530
You know Henry Roan?

01:35:53.704 --> 01:35:55.227
Nah, I don't know him.

01:35:57.316 --> 01:35:59.318
Well, what you think?

01:36:02.495 --> 01:36:05.324
Lookee here.
I'm gonna take you right now.

01:36:05.498 --> 01:36:09.067
I'm gonna buy you a roadster
so you can drive around
and do this for him.

01:36:09.241 --> 01:36:12.418
It's gonna take a lot more
than a roadster to get me
out of the bind I'm in.

01:36:12.592 --> 01:36:14.377
Well, we'll work something out.

01:36:14.551 --> 01:36:16.640
I hope you don't rumble
over this killing neither.

01:36:16.814 --> 01:36:19.251
The Indian, he's--
He's a melancholic.

01:36:19.425 --> 01:36:21.079
He's tried
to do away with himself
twice't already.

01:36:21.253 --> 01:36:23.516
That's what Hale's been saying.

01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:27.477
He even wants you to make it
like Roan did it to himself.

01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:32.134
In the front of the head,
you understand?
Front of the head.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:40.925
[crowd cheering, applauding]

01:36:58.987 --> 01:37:00.945
Knights come marching in.
That's it, Pitts.

01:37:01.119 --> 01:37:03.208
Hey, Ernest. [chuckles]

01:37:09.954 --> 01:37:13.175
[Ramsey] <i>So Ernest had me
meet this Indian over
at a restaurant in Fairfax.</i>

01:37:13.349 --> 01:37:15.394
[Ernest] John.
John Ramsey.[Ramsey] John Ramsey.

01:37:15.568 --> 01:37:17.570
- Henry. It's a pleasure.
- How you doing?

01:37:17.744 --> 01:37:20.617
<i>He sat down beside me,
and I smelled whiskey
on his breath.</i>

01:37:20.791 --> 01:37:22.793
...you might be in the market
for a little hooch?

01:37:22.967 --> 01:37:24.273
<i>I told him
I could sell him some.</i>

01:37:24.447 --> 01:37:26.536
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm the man
to see for that.

01:37:26.710 --> 01:37:30.061
<i>I told him to meet me
out on the road running through
Sol Smith's pasture</i>

01:37:30.235 --> 01:37:32.020
<i>about ten o'clock.</i>

01:37:32.194 --> 01:37:36.111
Whoo-hoo. Partner.
Look what I done found
in the possum hole.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.687
- [Ramsey laughs]
- [Henry speaks indistinctly]

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:53.084
- Come on. Don't be stingy, now.
[laughs]
- Yeah.

01:37:53.650 --> 01:37:54.694
[exhales sharply]

01:37:56.435 --> 01:37:59.047
[Ramsey] Mmm. [coughs] Oh.

01:37:59.221 --> 01:38:03.486
Boy, that'll make your liver
turn inside out. [laughs]

01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:10.188
<i>A few times after I met
this Indian, well, we kind of
got to liking one another,</i>

01:38:10.362 --> 01:38:13.017
<i>what with his troubles
being respected and all.</i>

01:38:13.191 --> 01:38:15.585
<i>And then sometimes
we'd go to Mrs. Mackie's place.</i>

01:38:15.759 --> 01:38:17.587
So he took it.
Can you imagine that?

01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:20.590
What kind of sheriff
goes around selling cocaine?
You tell me that.

01:38:20.764 --> 01:38:22.157
Don't you tell me that.

01:38:22.331 --> 01:38:25.290
[Ramsey]
<i>This went on for a while.</i>

01:38:25.464 --> 01:38:28.511
<i>I was trying to rib up
a little more courage,</i>

01:38:28.685 --> 01:38:33.298
<i>and one day I decided
to pull the job,
everything being favorable.</i>

01:38:33.472 --> 01:38:37.868
<i>So I told this Indian
we get us a jug and some girls</i>

01:38:38.042 --> 01:38:41.002
<i>and meet me out on the road
running through Smith's pasture.</i>

01:38:41.176 --> 01:38:43.700
Trust me, this is better
than the last stuff we had.

01:39:00.847 --> 01:39:02.371
[engine starts]

01:39:06.723 --> 01:39:09.944
[people chattering indistinctly]

01:39:20.476 --> 01:39:22.043
Goddamn.

01:39:23.305 --> 01:39:25.960
- You got a minute?
- Yeah, yeah.
Watch Cowboy for me.

01:39:32.531 --> 01:39:33.489
What? What is it?

01:39:33.663 --> 01:39:34.969
Where's Hale?

01:39:35.143 --> 01:39:38.146
I don't know.
Whizbang, Pawhuska. What?

01:39:38.711 --> 01:39:40.017
Tell him it's done.

01:39:40.844 --> 01:39:42.802
You did it? You did it where?

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:46.371
Out on the road running through
Sol Smith's pasture.
And that's it.

01:39:46.545 --> 01:39:48.721
Take this.
I don't want it no more.

01:39:48.895 --> 01:39:50.636
- John.
- I'm done with this outfit.

01:40:00.646 --> 01:40:02.126
[Ernest] Henry Roan's dead.

01:40:11.266 --> 01:40:12.702
Did he kill himself?

01:40:14.095 --> 01:40:15.574
[clicks tongue] Don't know.

01:40:20.144 --> 01:40:22.146
He was always sad.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.106
Always.

01:40:28.196 --> 01:40:29.675
You knew him well, right?

01:40:31.068 --> 01:40:32.722
Since we were children.

01:40:38.119 --> 01:40:41.731
Does your uncle know?
They were friends.

01:40:41.905 --> 01:40:45.126
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He knows.

01:40:48.651 --> 01:40:49.956
Was he murdered?

01:40:53.699 --> 01:40:54.874
Don't know.

01:40:56.659 --> 01:41:01.664
[sniffs] He tried
to kill himself last year.

01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:05.407
Did you know that?

01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:07.365
[Ernest] Mm-hmm.

01:41:12.805 --> 01:41:17.071
Was he murdered
or did he kill himself?
Do you know?

01:41:17.941 --> 01:41:19.073
I--

01:41:20.117 --> 01:41:21.379
I don't know.

01:41:24.252 --> 01:41:29.300
You know, Roy Bunch,
he was making a lot of noise
about killing him.

01:41:29.474 --> 01:41:32.086
You know, he's on his wife,
so... [chuckles]

01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:34.218
...don't need to look
too far, right?

01:41:36.525 --> 01:41:40.572
Maybe he, uh,
just killed himself,
you know, like you said.

01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:47.188
It was supposed to be a suicide,
you dumbbell.

01:41:47.362 --> 01:41:48.928
You didn't tell him
to leave the gun?

01:41:49.103 --> 01:41:50.713
I told him to leave the gun.
I told him exac--

01:41:50.887 --> 01:41:52.976
You told him
- to leave the gun?
- Just like you told me, King.

01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:55.065
I don't know why he didn't.
I don't know why.

01:41:55.239 --> 01:41:57.502
I told him
just like you told me.

01:41:57.676 --> 01:41:59.200
You told him to do it
in the front of the head?

01:41:59.374 --> 01:42:01.202
Then why'd he do it in the back?

01:42:01.376 --> 01:42:03.900
It's so simple.
The front is the front,
the back is the back!

01:42:04.074 --> 01:42:06.337
Ma-- He has to make it look
like he done it himself!

01:42:06.511 --> 01:42:09.993
It just looks like murder.
It's not supposed to be
that way, you hear?

01:42:10.167 --> 01:42:13.562
I told him the front
of the head. Just like this.
Just like you told me.

01:42:13.736 --> 01:42:15.607
I promise you. I promise you.
I swear on my children.

01:42:15.781 --> 01:42:18.958
Don't do that.
- Calm down. Settle down.
- I swear on my children, King.

01:42:19.133 --> 01:42:21.831
And don't swear
on your children.
Makes you look foolish.

01:42:22.005 --> 01:42:25.008
[Ernest] I ain't.
I ain't foolish
'cause I've done it right.

01:42:30.448 --> 01:42:31.841
What is this, King?

01:42:32.755 --> 01:42:33.930
[Hale] 'Fraid lights.

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:37.455
They're putting up lights
to keep the murder away.

01:42:39.457 --> 01:42:40.937
[speaking Osage]

01:42:46.682 --> 01:42:48.336
[speaks Osage]
Go, go, go.

01:42:52.514 --> 01:42:54.472
[speaks Osage]

01:43:01.087 --> 01:43:03.786
[in English] There he is.
Pull up the car.

01:43:04.569 --> 01:43:06.310
Hey, Roy! Roy!

01:43:11.924 --> 01:43:14.797
This is not the place
you should be at right now.

01:43:14.971 --> 01:43:17.408
And I have a line
that says you should leave town,

01:43:17.582 --> 01:43:21.020
'cause the sheriff's office
is looking to charge you
in this killing.

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:23.458
They know you was
on shooting terms with Henry.

01:43:24.894 --> 01:43:28.767
If I run, I'm guilty.
I ain't got nothing
to be guilty about.

01:43:28.941 --> 01:43:30.856
[Hale] If you run--[chuckles]

01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:34.556
You don't run, you're gonna
go to prison for this,
you done it or not.

01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:39.300
Just-- Just my friendly word.
I would run.

01:43:39.474 --> 01:43:42.651
Thank you, Bill.
I don't think I will.

01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.307
And you're not my friend.

01:43:47.569 --> 01:43:49.614
Take my chances
right here in Fairfax.

01:44:00.408 --> 01:44:04.107

01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:42.493
<i>Momma died from it too.</i>

01:44:43.842 --> 01:44:45.322
<i>Anna was shot.</i>

01:44:52.634 --> 01:44:55.201
<i>This blanket is
a target on our backs.</i>

01:45:27.756 --> 01:45:31.150
Why don't we just leave?
Go to Colorado Springs.

01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:35.459
Look at me.
I can't make that trip.

01:45:36.678 --> 01:45:39.028
How are you being
taken care of, Mollie?

01:45:39.855 --> 01:45:41.813
I have Ernest and my children.

01:45:43.293 --> 01:45:46.992
Ernest takes care of me.
[breathes shakily]
The best he can.

01:45:47.166 --> 01:45:48.733
- Nettie?
- Yes.

01:45:48.907 --> 01:45:50.779
Can you get my sister
some toast, please?

01:45:50.953 --> 01:45:53.477
- Of course.
And a bit more coffee too?
- Thank you.

01:45:54.522 --> 01:45:56.350
[in Osage]

01:46:01.442 --> 01:46:02.834
[Reta, in English] Thank you.

01:46:15.456 --> 01:46:17.980
So you and Mollie
staying in town now too, huh?

01:46:18.154 --> 01:46:19.547
Yeah, we're here now, so...

01:46:25.596 --> 01:46:26.641
Hmm.

01:46:29.034 --> 01:46:32.342
You made a nice place
for yourself, Bill.
Real nice.

01:46:32.516 --> 01:46:35.998
Thank you, Ernest.
Shoun brothers gave us
a sweet deal

01:46:36.172 --> 01:46:38.566
and they left some nice things
here for us too.

01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:40.742
Is that right?

01:46:40.916 --> 01:46:44.528
Well, not nearly as nice
as what you've been buying
but good enough for us.

01:46:45.442 --> 01:46:46.922
Well, you know Mollie.

01:46:47.096 --> 01:46:50.404
She likes her nice things, so...

01:46:52.971 --> 01:46:54.451
Not as much as you do.

01:46:56.975 --> 01:47:01.719
Almost sounded to me like you...
[stammers] ...you was calling me
a squaw man, Bill.

01:47:01.893 --> 01:47:05.288
Oh, now, Ernest,
that's something
I'd never call another man.

01:47:05.462 --> 01:47:06.550
Right, right.

01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:09.205
No offense taken.

01:47:14.079 --> 01:47:15.254
You need a drink?

01:47:16.952 --> 01:47:20.085
Yeah. I'll take a drink
if you got one.

01:47:21.565 --> 01:47:22.566
No.

01:47:25.177 --> 01:47:26.788
Then why di'ya ask?

01:47:27.658 --> 01:47:29.965
Well, you seem nervous,
that's all.

01:47:30.139 --> 01:47:35.492
[grunts] See, the thing is,
Bill, I ain't got no nerves.
None at all.

01:47:35.666 --> 01:47:36.841
[chuckles]

01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:41.846
It's just that I don't like
talking to you.

01:47:42.804 --> 01:47:44.240
That's mostly it.

01:47:46.285 --> 01:47:48.418
Well, have I done something
to bother you, Ernest?

01:47:48.592 --> 01:47:51.769
Something that's bothering me?
No, no. Just--

01:47:51.943 --> 01:47:55.904
Just the way you are
that bothers me.
That's what it is.

01:47:57.296 --> 01:48:01.257
Well, Lord made me, Ernest.
Ain't nothing I can do
about that.

01:48:01.431 --> 01:48:03.085
No. There ain't.

01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:05.870
Unless you aim to kill me.

01:48:06.697 --> 01:48:08.482
Or is that
your big brother's job?

01:48:13.748 --> 01:48:15.010
[Ernest grunts]

01:48:18.579 --> 01:48:21.843
Mollie?
It's time to go, sweetheart.

01:48:22.887 --> 01:48:24.106
- Jim?
<i>- Myrtle?</i>

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.673
If you have anything special
in the house,

01:48:25.847 --> 01:48:27.718
get it out as soon as possible.

01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:29.894
Okay.

01:48:32.506 --> 01:48:33.507
David?

01:48:36.988 --> 01:48:39.513
[horn honks][Ernest shouts]

01:48:46.084 --> 01:48:47.521
- [Ernest] You all right?
- Yeah.

01:48:47.695 --> 01:48:49.740
I'm off to Fort Worth
for the Stock Show,

01:48:49.914 --> 01:48:53.135
but I want you to find
Acie Kirby and tell him
it's time on the Smith job.

01:48:55.529 --> 01:48:57.922
- Mmm.
- You hear me?

01:48:58.096 --> 01:49:03.449
[stutters]
I just don't know him. I--
I don't know Acie Kirby. Wh--

01:49:03.624 --> 01:49:05.103
Where does he find Acie?

01:49:05.277 --> 01:49:07.410
Just find John Ramsey.
He'll know.

01:49:07.584 --> 01:49:11.370
You got that?
Find John Ramsey. Tell Ramsey
to tell Acie it's time.

01:49:11.545 --> 01:49:12.937
We're off to Fort Worth.

01:49:15.723 --> 01:49:17.551
We're off to Fort Worth.

01:49:19.988 --> 01:49:22.207
Look at me
like this makes sense.

01:49:22.381 --> 01:49:28.213
I am. I understand.
I'll find Ramsey
and I'll tell him.

01:49:28.387 --> 01:49:29.780
[engine starts][Hale] Okay.

01:49:37.179 --> 01:49:39.137
- Uh, John?
- Yeah, that's me.

01:49:39.311 --> 01:49:41.531
I got a message for you
from King Hale.

01:49:41.705 --> 01:49:43.185
He wants you to find Acie Kirby

01:49:43.359 --> 01:49:45.361
and tell him to take care
of Bill and Reta, all right?

01:49:45.535 --> 01:49:48.756
- It's time now, John.
- I can't do it right now.
My wife's sick.

01:49:48.930 --> 01:49:51.585
Well, my wife's sick too.
My wife's sick too.

01:49:51.759 --> 01:49:53.804
Why don't you do it?

01:49:53.978 --> 01:49:55.893
Why are you always
trying to get somebody like me
to do your work for you?

01:49:56.067 --> 01:49:59.810
Well, 'cause I don't know--
I don't know Acie Kirby.

01:49:59.984 --> 01:50:02.160
I don't know
what he looks like even, right?

01:50:02.334 --> 01:50:05.468
I would do it,
but I can't do it 'cause I don't
know what he looks like, John.

01:50:05.642 --> 01:50:07.165
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

01:50:07.339 --> 01:50:09.777
All right. I'll do it,
but I can't do it right now.

01:50:09.951 --> 01:50:11.822
You can't get to it right now,
so you know,

01:50:11.996 --> 01:50:14.477
this needs to be done
straightaway, not to wait on it,
for Hale.

01:50:14.651 --> 01:50:16.610
It has to be done straightaway.
Right now.

01:50:16.784 --> 01:50:18.960
You know, you're being
mighty pushy, Ernest.

01:50:19.134 --> 01:50:20.788
- I gotta get back to work.
- Let me tell you something.

01:50:20.962 --> 01:50:24.400
You got one more chance, John.
This is it. One more chance.

01:50:24.574 --> 01:50:27.316
I'ma talk to King Hale.
I'ma tell him
you're gonna do it right now.

01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:29.231
I don't wanna lose this job.
[mutters]

01:50:29.405 --> 01:50:31.668
John, you ain't got no choice!
It's time.

01:50:33.235 --> 01:50:35.541
- Tryin' to be nice to you now.
- I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna fix it.

01:50:35.716 --> 01:50:37.543
I'm tryin' to be nice
to you, John!

01:50:37.718 --> 01:50:40.416
- I'm doing it. I said
I'm gonna do it.
- Yeah, you best do it.

01:50:40.590 --> 01:50:41.939
Right now, John. Right now.

01:50:50.731 --> 01:50:52.254
[knocks]

01:50:52.428 --> 01:50:55.257
Acie. Acie.

01:50:55.953 --> 01:50:56.954
[Acie] Yeah.

01:50:57.128 --> 01:50:59.478
It's John. Don't shoot.

01:51:02.264 --> 01:51:03.613
[sighs]

01:51:08.444 --> 01:51:09.837
You got your soup with you?

01:51:14.189 --> 01:51:18.497
[Cowboy] Momma! Mommy!

01:51:18.672 --> 01:51:20.108
[Ernest] Where were you, huh?

01:51:20.282 --> 01:51:21.500
I was at Reta's.

01:51:21.675 --> 01:51:23.589
Well, you're supposed
to be home.

01:51:24.547 --> 01:51:25.591
Come on.

01:51:29.247 --> 01:51:32.033
- Cowboy had an earache.
- Oh, boy. Really?

01:51:32.207 --> 01:51:35.732
And you know
Bill ain't too kind to Reta
when I'm not there.

01:51:37.821 --> 01:51:40.345
Listen, Mollie,
I-- I-- [clears throat]

01:51:40.519 --> 01:51:43.479
I don't want you
going out so much right now,
with all that's going on.

01:51:43.653 --> 01:51:45.350
[speaks Osage]

01:51:51.705 --> 01:51:53.968
- [in English] All right?
- [sighs]

01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.774
[Mollie gasps, screams]

01:52:17.948 --> 01:52:21.343
- Oh, Lord!
- What was that?
What was that?

01:52:21.517 --> 01:52:23.388
I don't know! I don't know.

01:52:23.562 --> 01:52:25.086
- Vera!
- [Ernest] Oh, Lord.

01:52:25.739 --> 01:52:26.870
[Mollie] Vera!

01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:30.134
Lizzie!

01:52:30.308 --> 01:52:33.137
- [person in distance]
What happened?
- [Mollie] Cowboy to Mommy.

01:52:33.311 --> 01:52:36.532
[baby Anna cries][Mollie speaks indistinctly]

01:52:36.706 --> 01:52:39.970
[Vera] This is just like Tulsa.
It's just like Tulsa.

01:52:40.144 --> 01:52:41.711
[person 2] <i>Careful,
there's glass everywhere!</i>

01:52:41.885 --> 01:52:43.321
[person 3] <i>Where the hell
did that come from?</i>

01:52:43.495 --> 01:52:46.107
- [Mollie] Whose house is it?
- [baby Anna cries]

01:52:47.151 --> 01:52:48.718
[Mollie] Whose house is it?

01:52:49.719 --> 01:52:51.112
[bystander]
It's Bill and Reta's!

01:52:51.286 --> 01:52:52.896
[bystander 2]
Bill and Reta's house.

01:53:09.913 --> 01:53:11.349
Nettie stays in the back room,
that way!

01:53:11.523 --> 01:53:12.960
[bystander 3] Nettie's
back there!

01:53:13.134 --> 01:53:14.352
[bystander 2] Nettie Berkshire!
She lives here!

01:53:14.526 --> 01:53:15.745
[bystander 3] Nettie!

01:53:15.919 --> 01:53:18.269
- Nettie!
- That's Bill Smith!

01:53:18.443 --> 01:53:22.317
Shoot me! Shoot me!
Shoot me, goddamn it!

01:53:22.491 --> 01:53:25.015
[coughs] Shoot me!

01:53:26.669 --> 01:53:29.541
[bystander 4] It's Reta!
Reta's over here!

01:53:30.673 --> 01:53:32.762
[bystander 5]
It's Reta, come on! It's Reta!

01:53:37.506 --> 01:53:40.726
- Can you hear me, Reta?
- [bystander 4] Reta. Reta. Reta.

01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:43.512
Reta.

01:53:54.784 --> 01:53:56.481
[bystander 5]
I think she's dead.

01:53:57.613 --> 01:53:59.006

you're pronouncing yourself
too much, Bill.

Nettie, the maid.

Well, that's a hard trip

01:56:32.594 --> 01:56:36.206
<i>And I can't let you have
this money or make this trip.</i>

Mr. President, Mollie Burkhart.
Please send help.

01:57:28.041 --> 01:57:31.087
There's murder in Osage,
and the police do nothing.

01:57:32.219 --> 01:57:34.525
I lost my mother and my sisters.

01:57:34.699 --> 01:57:37.528
So many Osage are killed
for the oil money. Please.

01:57:38.312 --> 01:57:39.443

That's this whole vial.

01:58:06.035 --> 01:58:08.820
Now, make sure you get
the balance right, Ernest.

01:58:08.994 --> 01:58:11.084
[James Shoun]
Now, you keep the shots regular.

01:58:12.085 --> 01:58:13.782
It's just to slow her down.

01:58:13.956 --> 01:58:15.827
[David Shoun]
That's all it's gonna do.
Slow her down.

01:58:16.001 --> 01:58:17.873
[Hale] Mm-hmm.[David Shoun]
That's all it'll do.

[James Shoun]
Same time every day,
30 minutes before a meal.

01:58:21.268 --> 01:58:22.791
[David Shoun] The whole vial.

01:58:31.713 --> 01:58:34.803
Ernest,
you believe in the Bible?

01:58:37.545 --> 01:58:40.635
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Miracles of old?

01:58:40.809 --> 01:58:41.940
Mmm.

01:58:43.290 --> 01:58:45.727
Expecting a miracle
to make all this go away?

01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:51.036
- [sniffs] Mm-mmm.
- You know they don't
happen anymore.

01:58:54.257 --> 01:58:55.302
I know.

01:58:56.694 --> 01:59:00.959
I know, King. She's, uh--
She's gone to Washington, so...

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:07.444
Just gotta...
s-- slow her down, right?

01:59:08.097 --> 01:59:09.054
Yep.

01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:11.100
Just gonna slow her down some.

01:59:26.246 --> 01:59:28.291
I'm afraid, <i>Sho-meen-kah.</i>

01:59:30.206 --> 01:59:31.642
What are you afraid of?

01:59:35.472 --> 01:59:37.953
I'm afraid to eat in my house.

01:59:39.911 --> 01:59:42.871
Why are you afraid
to eat in your own house?

01:59:45.439 --> 01:59:46.875
[in Osage]

01:59:49.704 --> 01:59:53.186
[in English]
Do you have any idea
who might want to harm you?

02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:10.290
[Mollie] <i>I wanna bring
the upstairs bed down,
into the back room.</i>

02:00:12.988 --> 02:00:17.949
<i>We will eat food
only made by Vera,
no one else.</i>

02:00:24.869 --> 02:00:27.437
<i>Baby Anna is sick
with whooping cough.</i>

02:00:29.004 --> 02:00:30.179
<i>She needs care.</i>

[Mollie] <i>I want her
to live with Brother
and Sister Bigheart.</i>

02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:42.931
<i>This will make her better.
It'll cure her cough.</i>

02:00:43.105 --> 02:00:45.716
[baby Anna] Mommy!

02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:50.591
Ernest, you pick up my insulin
from the train, you alone.

02:00:51.592 --> 02:00:54.072
Do not take it
from the Shoun brothers.

02:00:55.857 --> 02:00:57.946

02:01:44.906 --> 02:01:49.867
My mother came to me.
She asked me to dance with her.

02:01:51.434 --> 02:01:55.525
[sighs] I told her
I can't dance anymore.

02:02:03.272 --> 02:02:05.405
She told me I was dying.

02:02:08.843 --> 02:02:11.367
She didn't want me to die alone.

02:02:15.502 --> 02:02:18.287
Well, dreams, they can
make you feel like dying...

02:02:20.289 --> 02:02:21.943
[grunts]

02:02:22.117 --> 02:02:26.687
...for just a little while,
and then-- then you come back.

02:02:27.731 --> 02:02:29.124
Hmm?

02:02:32.475 --> 02:02:34.390
She said the man is here.

02:02:35.435 --> 02:02:36.653
[Ernest scoffs]

02:02:36.827 --> 02:02:37.915
What man?

02:02:39.656 --> 02:02:41.136
The man in the hat.

02:02:42.398 --> 02:02:45.270
- Hmm.
- I wanna talk
to the man in the hat.

02:02:46.924 --> 02:02:51.102
[grunts] Well, there's a lot of
fellas with hats, right?

02:02:52.495 --> 02:02:54.976
[speaks Osage]

02:02:58.806 --> 02:03:00.242
[Ernest, in English] Shh.

[Mollie sighs]

02:03:17.259 --> 02:03:18.782
[whispers] You just rest.

02:03:42.545 --> 02:03:43.677
Mr. Burkhart?

02:03:44.852 --> 02:03:46.419
Who is that?

02:03:46.593 --> 02:03:49.291
My name's Tom White. I'm with
the Bureau of Investigation.

02:03:59.867 --> 02:04:01.042
How do you do?

02:04:01.216 --> 02:04:04.045
Bureau... What? What is that?
[chuckles]

02:04:04.219 --> 02:04:08.484
Oh, I was sent down
from Washington, D.C.,
to see about these murders.

02:04:10.181 --> 02:04:13.968
Hmm. To see--
see what about 'em?

02:04:15.578 --> 02:04:16.753
See who's doing it.

02:04:18.276 --> 02:04:19.452
Mmm.

02:04:20.409 --> 02:04:22.672
You a detective? Mmm.

02:04:22.846 --> 02:04:26.502
- You a Pinkerton?
What are you? [chuckles]
- No, sir, I was a Texas Ranger.

02:04:26.676 --> 02:04:28.852
I'm now with
the federal government.

02:04:29.026 --> 02:04:31.115
It's called
the Bureau of Investigation.

02:04:31.289 --> 02:04:32.856
Um...

02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:34.945
I tell you what,
if you got questions--

02:04:35.119 --> 02:04:37.992
If you got questions, uh,
y'all go talk to the sheriff.

02:04:38.166 --> 02:04:39.820
He can probably tell you
what you need to know.

02:04:39.994 --> 02:04:42.736
Oh, yes, sir, I have, uh--
I talked to him.

02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:49.220
But I'm here to speak with
Mollie Burkhart whose-- whose
sisters and mother is dead.

02:04:49.394 --> 02:04:55.052
Yeah, Mollie?
Yeah, no, she's my--
She's my wife. [chuckles]

02:04:55.662 --> 02:04:57.925
[grunts]

02:04:58.099 --> 02:05:02.799
She's-- She's sick, real sick
right now. I'm-- I'm her husband
Ernest Burkhart, so...

02:05:03.974 --> 02:05:05.280
You can call on her
another time.

02:05:05.454 --> 02:05:07.108
But right now,
I don't know what to tell you.

02:05:07.282 --> 02:05:09.284
She's not doing too well, so...

02:05:11.199 --> 02:05:12.635
How's tomorrow?

02:05:12.809 --> 02:05:15.464
Tomorrow? Well, it's-- That--
That's too soon.

02:05:15.638 --> 02:05:20.164
It's just...
[inhales deeply] ...like I said,
she's not-- not doing too well.

02:05:20.338 --> 02:05:23.646
But you can come back--
Come back on Friday,
how about that?

02:05:25.039 --> 02:05:26.257
Well, is she home right now?

02:05:27.476 --> 02:05:28.782
Well, she-- she--

02:05:30.044 --> 02:05:32.655
[softly] She got the diabetes,
you understand? Yeah.

02:05:32.829 --> 02:05:35.049
- Oh, does she?
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:05:35.223 --> 02:05:38.226
She's resting right now,
and I'm caring for her, so...

02:05:39.532 --> 02:05:42.404
Well, you come back on Friday,
all right?

02:05:43.710 --> 02:05:45.320
- Friday?
- Yeah. Friday.

02:05:45.494 --> 02:05:47.627
I'll do that. Thank you, sir.

Osage relations in Hominy.

02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:47.991
[Ernest] I gotta talk to you,
King. Gotta talk to you.
Sorry about that.

02:06:48.165 --> 02:06:49.732
- Not now.
- No, I can't wait.

02:06:49.906 --> 02:06:51.647
I gotta talk to you--You're gonna have to wait.

02:06:51.821 --> 02:06:54.519
Can't wait.
They came to my house.
They came to my house.

02:06:54.694 --> 02:06:56.609
What is the matter
- with you?
- Gotta talk to you.

02:06:57.522 --> 02:06:58.872
[Hale] What's the matter?

02:07:01.048 --> 02:07:02.005
Ernest.

02:07:03.528 --> 02:07:06.314
I'm worried, King.
They came to my house.
They came in the house.

02:07:06.488 --> 02:07:07.402
Private investigators.

02:07:07.576 --> 02:07:10.274
[whispers, indistinct]

02:07:10.448 --> 02:07:12.059
- Your house?
- My house, yeah.

02:07:12.233 --> 02:07:14.278
- Who told you that?
- I don't know
what they wanted.

02:07:14.452 --> 02:07:17.368
They just-- They--
- They came to my house.
- You-- [stammers] What'd you do?

02:07:17.542 --> 02:07:20.110
Look,
I'm getting worried, all right?
They knew something.

02:07:20.284 --> 02:07:25.072
[whispers, indistinct]

02:07:25.246 --> 02:07:26.900
They're gonna know
- we did something.
- Settle down.

02:07:27.074 --> 02:07:28.336
King, we gotta talk
about this right now.

02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:31.644
You've got to settle down.
Settle down.

02:07:31.818 --> 02:07:33.210
- Do you understand me?
- I do. I do.

02:07:33.384 --> 02:07:34.777
- Get hold of yourself.
- I am.

02:07:34.951 --> 02:07:36.431
Get hold of yourself
and settle down.

02:07:36.605 --> 02:07:39.434
I'm trying.
I am trying, but you--Settle down.

02:07:39.608 --> 02:07:41.958
When are we--
When are we gonna talk--Right now. Now. Now!

02:07:42.132 --> 02:07:45.005
We'll talk later.
- Not now. Not now.
- All right, all right.

02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:49.792
King, wha--Not now.

02:08:21.476 --> 02:08:24.784
[Chief Paul Red Eagle]
Are you here
because McBride was killed?

02:08:24.958 --> 02:08:26.655
That white man?

02:08:26.829 --> 02:08:28.788
Or is it because we had to go
to Washington

02:08:28.962 --> 02:08:33.314
and pay United States government
$20,000 to get you here?

02:08:33.488 --> 02:08:35.446
[tribe members murmuring
in agreement]

02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:38.711
Well, I don't believe
it's too late to find out
who's been doing this.

02:08:39.668 --> 02:08:40.887
- Um...
- [Chief Paul Red Eagle] Who?

02:08:41.061 --> 02:08:43.063
We have so many deaths,
we've lost count.

02:08:43.237 --> 02:08:44.499
[tribe members murmur]

02:08:44.673 --> 02:08:45.935
[Chief Paul Red Eagle]
We have hundreds down.

02:08:46.109 --> 02:08:48.503
In the old days,
we would fight these people.

02:08:48.677 --> 02:08:51.462
Twenty years ago,
when I fought overseas
in the Boxer Rebellion,

02:08:51.636 --> 02:08:54.161
I could see my enemy,
and I knew who I had to kill.

02:08:54.335 --> 02:08:55.728
[tribe member murmurs]

02:08:55.902 --> 02:08:58.513
If we could find these people,
we would kill them.

02:08:58.687 --> 02:09:01.603
[tribe members murmuring
in agreement]

02:09:01.777 --> 02:09:05.433
No, no, no, no. It's $25,000
come due on Henry Roan.

02:09:05.607 --> 02:09:08.871
He's been dead months.
He's been dead months.

02:09:09.045 --> 02:09:11.134
Please, just give me
my Henry Roan money.

02:09:11.308 --> 02:09:14.007
You're gonna have
to argue that out with Denver.
They're contesting the claim.

02:09:14.181 --> 02:09:16.444
- Who are you?
- I'm J.T. Jones,
from the Denver office.

02:09:16.618 --> 02:09:18.228
Well, J.T. Jones,
I want to tell you something.

02:09:18.402 --> 02:09:21.492
This is a Fairfax problem.
It's not a Denver problem.

02:09:21.666 --> 02:09:23.668
The claim went to Denver.
They are contesting it.

02:09:23.843 --> 02:09:26.802
You keep saying Denver.
It's not Denver, it's Fairfax.

02:09:26.976 --> 02:09:29.936
Now,
I want my Roan money, please.
Write that note.

02:09:30.110 --> 02:09:32.939
Mr. Hale, I'm sorry, but until
I hear from Denver, I can't--

02:09:33.113 --> 02:09:35.202
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, sir.

02:09:35.376 --> 02:09:38.205
You're not gonna honor this?
You're not gonna give me
that money?

02:09:38.379 --> 02:09:40.642
- No, sir.
- Well, you're gonna regret this.

02:09:40.816 --> 02:09:43.384
You're gonna regret this,
Mr. Insurance Man.

02:09:46.953 --> 02:09:49.738
- [Jones] Gentlemen, come in.
- [John, indistinct]

02:09:52.436 --> 02:09:54.134
[cows mooing]

02:09:57.528 --> 02:09:59.661
- [ranch hand] Hey, Mr. Hale?
- Yeah.

02:09:59.835 --> 02:10:01.358
CJ Robinson's here to see you.

02:10:01.532 --> 02:10:03.143
- Mr. Hale.
- CJ.

02:10:04.884 --> 02:10:06.624
Wanna make a price on this?

02:10:07.538 --> 02:10:10.628
Well, thought
I'd take a look first.

02:10:10.803 --> 02:10:12.326
All right. Make it quick.
Not too long.

02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:15.459
[cows mooing]

02:10:16.504 --> 02:10:18.680
[crying] She has no face.

02:10:20.290 --> 02:10:21.901
They took her head.

02:10:22.075 --> 02:10:27.384
We didn't smoke her to the sky.
Wah-kon-tah won't know her.

02:10:28.603 --> 02:10:30.692
We smoked the house.

02:10:30.866 --> 02:10:34.522
We smoked the house, darling.
You jus-- just don't remember,
that's all.

02:10:35.044 --> 02:10:37.003
You don't remember.

02:10:37.177 --> 02:10:41.398
We-- We was there
with Bill and-- and Reta
and Joseph and Bertha.

02:10:41.572 --> 02:10:45.011
We-- We was all there together.
We was there together for hours.

02:10:45.185 --> 02:10:47.883
It's just...
You don't remember, that's all.

02:11:00.504 --> 02:11:01.679
Mollie?

02:11:04.595 --> 02:11:05.640
[fly buzzes]

02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:13.343
You just rest now.

02:11:19.262 --> 02:11:22.875
James and David Shoun,
Bureau of Investigation.

02:11:23.049 --> 02:11:25.834
We'd like to ask you
a few questions about
the death of Anna Brown.

02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:29.925
[David Shoun] Get dressed.
We'll be right back.

02:11:32.058 --> 02:11:33.537
[James Shoun grunts]

02:11:33.711 --> 02:11:36.801
I think you need to see the, uh,
justice of the peace.

02:11:36.976 --> 02:11:40.022
He has the inquest records
about Anna Brown's death.

02:11:40.196 --> 02:11:43.286
Those records have gone missing
from his desk.

02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:46.811
- So, then you need
the undertaker, Turton.
- Turton.

02:11:46.986 --> 02:11:50.859
Yeah, he, uh-- He has
all the details you might need.

02:11:51.033 --> 02:11:54.602
Uh... He kept the skull,
- didn't he, David?
- Oh, yes. Yes. [chuckles]

02:11:54.776 --> 02:11:57.692
Seen him too,
and that's what brings us
to you.

02:11:58.867 --> 02:12:01.522
Possible you lost the bullet
that killed her?

02:12:01.696 --> 02:12:05.091
[David Shoun chuckles]
Well, no, because
we never found it.

02:12:06.657 --> 02:12:09.704
That's why you were
tearing up the brain,
looking for the bullet?

02:12:10.966 --> 02:12:13.142
Yes, that's right.

02:12:13.316 --> 02:12:16.711
The condition of the corpse
was so bad because she had been
dead for five or--

02:12:16.885 --> 02:12:19.018
- Six. Six days.
- Six days.

02:12:19.192 --> 02:12:21.716
And, uh, then we exhumed her.

02:12:23.152 --> 02:12:25.328
Why did you cut the body up
into small pieces

02:12:25.502 --> 02:12:28.462
and cleave the flesh
from the limbs
with a meat axe?

02:12:28.636 --> 02:12:30.855
We were looking for the bullet.
[laughs]

02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:32.118
[agent] Uh-huh.

02:12:32.292 --> 02:12:35.121
We couldn't find it.
[chuckles] Yeah.

02:12:35.295 --> 02:12:38.124
You know, this is a matter
for the Indian tribal council.

02:12:38.298 --> 02:12:39.603
You should see Chief...

02:12:39.777 --> 02:12:40.996
- Bonnicastle.
- Bonnicastle.

02:12:41.170 --> 02:12:42.955
Oh, what's he gonna tell me?

02:12:43.129 --> 02:12:46.959
This is Indian country.
Go talk to the Indian.

02:12:47.611 --> 02:12:49.048
Excuse us, gentlemen.

02:12:49.874 --> 02:12:51.876
Well, well, well.

02:12:52.965 --> 02:12:54.618
What took you so long
to get here?

02:12:56.098 --> 02:12:59.319
Well, I was just assigned
to come down here a week ago.

02:12:59.493 --> 02:13:01.538
Oh. Assigned by who?
The president?

02:13:01.712 --> 02:13:04.541
No, sir. By J. Edgar Hoover.

02:13:04.715 --> 02:13:06.456
Well, I don't know him.

02:13:09.329 --> 02:13:12.767
Well, uh, I hear you're
the king of the Osage Hills,

02:13:12.941 --> 02:13:15.857
and you might be
the man to talk to.

02:13:16.031 --> 02:13:17.554
[Hale] I can give you
my opinion.

02:13:17.728 --> 02:13:20.253
Most likely this death business

02:13:21.645 --> 02:13:24.909
is at the hands
of a band of men from
outside these parts,

02:13:25.084 --> 02:13:26.650
possibly Nigras.

02:13:26.824 --> 02:13:28.130
You saw what happened in Tulsa?

02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:30.002
Yes, sir.

02:13:30.176 --> 02:13:32.526
Then again,
there's just bad luck.

02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:34.180
[White] Mmm.

02:13:34.354 --> 02:13:38.488
Anna Brown, nasty mouth.
A friend, but a nasty mouth.

02:13:38.662 --> 02:13:40.229
Bound to happen.

02:13:40.403 --> 02:13:44.320
Henry Roan,
he was a melancholic.
You must know that.

02:13:44.494 --> 02:13:46.757
Then, of course,
there was Charlie Whitehorn,

02:13:46.931 --> 02:13:49.412
one of the nicest people
you'd ever know.

02:13:49.586 --> 02:13:51.675
What about the other dead Osage?

02:13:51.849 --> 02:13:55.810
Twenty-five, it's gotta be
- almost 30 now.
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:13:55.984 --> 02:13:59.553
It seems more like an epidemic
than bad luck to me.

02:13:59.727 --> 02:14:02.947
Yeah, it seems to me
you need to speak
with our justice of the peace.

02:14:03.122 --> 02:14:07.343
I did. Uh, I visited with him,
and he was not very helpful.

02:14:07.517 --> 02:14:08.823
He wasn't? [grunts]

02:14:08.997 --> 02:14:10.216
Principal Chief?

02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:11.826
I visited with him too.

02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:15.569
They said to... [chuckles]
...come see you.

02:14:15.743 --> 02:14:17.266
[chuckles]

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:19.616
Well, we want to put a finish
to this death business,

02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:21.966
but this isn't the place
to do it.

02:14:22.141 --> 02:14:24.230
I'd be happy to talk to you
and answer any questions,
whenever you have them.

02:14:24.404 --> 02:14:27.581
We can meet somewhere else.
But here...? [chuckles]
Not quite the place.

02:14:27.755 --> 02:14:29.322
- [White chuckles]
- Hmm.

02:14:29.496 --> 02:14:31.802
I guess I-I'll find you
at a later date.

02:14:31.976 --> 02:14:35.241
Thank you for your time,
and I'm sorry to disturb
your shave.

02:14:35.415 --> 02:14:39.680
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.
I'll wait to hear from you.

02:14:42.248 --> 02:14:44.163
[reel clicking]

02:14:55.435 --> 02:14:56.784
[whispering] Hey, Blackie.

02:14:57.698 --> 02:14:58.829
Don't turn.

02:15:00.614 --> 02:15:03.617
Government men have been
coming around. Stirring.

02:15:05.401 --> 02:15:07.577
I've done my time.

02:15:07.751 --> 02:15:11.364
[Hale] No use
staying around someplace
when there's trouble.

02:15:11.538 --> 02:15:14.106
I owe you for what you've done
for my nephew.

02:15:15.150 --> 02:15:18.240
You stood pat
on that roadster debacle.

02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:24.028
Just spend time
down someplace else.
Stay out of town.

02:15:24.812 --> 02:15:26.770
That place might be Drumright.

02:15:29.121 --> 02:15:30.600
- Drumright?
- Drumright.

02:15:31.949 --> 02:15:36.345
Try and get there early.
Nigra janitor opens at sunrise.

02:15:40.306 --> 02:15:42.264
Appreciate the payday.

02:15:43.439 --> 02:15:44.614
[gunshots]

02:15:44.788 --> 02:15:46.399
Goddamnit!

02:15:49.315 --> 02:15:51.534
[officers shouting
indistinctly][outlaws shouting indistinctly]

02:15:51.708 --> 02:15:53.493
- [officer] Hands in the air!
- [officer 2] Don't you move!

02:15:53.667 --> 02:15:55.930
[Blackie grunts] Damn it.

02:15:56.713 --> 02:15:59.368
[grunting]

02:15:59.542 --> 02:16:02.980
Plié and straight.
Plié and straight.

02:16:03.155 --> 02:16:05.809
Thank you, Bill,
for your support
of this town

02:16:05.983 --> 02:16:08.290
and all the things you've done
for this community.

02:16:08.464 --> 02:16:11.467
And now this beautiful
dance school.

02:16:11.641 --> 02:16:15.428
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bill Hale, our sponsor.

02:16:20.215 --> 02:16:21.608
[no audible dialogue]

02:16:21.782 --> 02:16:23.262
We brought you an offering

02:16:23.436 --> 02:16:26.090
to invite you into our home,
to bless us with medicine.

02:16:28.702 --> 02:16:30.007
You made this?

02:16:30.747 --> 02:16:32.140
Did your girls get a pony?

02:16:32.314 --> 02:16:35.448
Yes, they did.
- Thank you, Bill.
- Course, course.

02:16:35.622 --> 02:16:41.541
Uh, Bob, I'd like you
to keep a watchful eye
on your business tonight.

02:16:41.715 --> 02:16:46.415
Yeah, I've heard that
they're setting up a robbery
of your store at 11:00 p.m.

02:16:47.982 --> 02:16:50.724
So, maybe it's those gems
you stashed.

02:16:52.639 --> 02:16:53.988
Two whites and a Nigra.

02:16:56.164 --> 02:16:57.426
Thank you, brother.

02:16:58.427 --> 02:16:59.472
Course.

02:17:03.911 --> 02:17:08.002
Acie, here's the rest I owe you,
with great appreciation.

02:17:09.612 --> 02:17:12.572
You aware there's
federal agents around, right?

02:17:12.746 --> 02:17:16.053
- Uh-huh.
- They're looking into
that blast.

02:17:17.533 --> 02:17:19.622
Well, this ain't federal land.
This is Indian land,

02:17:19.796 --> 02:17:21.755
so there's no trouble
that can come.

02:17:27.282 --> 02:17:29.066
Good time to take a trip.

02:17:30.894 --> 02:17:34.681
I have a nice opportunity
for you if you'll let me
tell you of something.

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.553
[Hale] Hmm?

02:17:39.642 --> 02:17:41.644
- Sure.
- Okay.

02:17:54.962 --> 02:17:56.833
[gunshot]

02:18:01.185 --> 02:18:02.274
[robber] C'mon!

02:18:07.844 --> 02:18:10.238
[Bob] Stop,
you thieving bastards!

02:18:33.348 --> 02:18:34.741
[White] How do you do, sir?

02:18:38.701 --> 02:18:40.442
Is this Henry Grammer's setup?

02:18:41.356 --> 02:18:43.619
Any idea where
we could find him?

02:18:43.793 --> 02:18:48.711
An angel done come down
and wrapped her big old wings
right in his chest.

02:18:48.885 --> 02:18:50.974
Now he's down with the snakes.

02:19:01.811 --> 02:19:02.769
When this happen?

02:19:02.943 --> 02:19:04.292
Yesterday.

02:19:05.641 --> 02:19:08.035
[patrons chattering
indistinctly]

02:19:15.521 --> 02:19:16.783
Put that away, brother.

02:19:16.957 --> 02:19:18.785
- What?
- Come on outside.

02:19:20.656 --> 02:19:23.267
Goddamn it. I quit. [coughs]

02:19:23.877 --> 02:19:24.965
What is it?

02:19:26.749 --> 02:19:27.750
Hey, Byron.

02:19:35.584 --> 02:19:36.629
What is it?

02:19:37.238 --> 02:19:38.239
Ernest,

02:19:39.153 --> 02:19:40.807
if you're charged,

02:19:40.981 --> 02:19:43.418
if anything happens,
you're gonna beat it.
It's okay.

02:19:43.592 --> 02:19:45.072
What are you... You're gonna beat it.

02:19:45.246 --> 02:19:47.509
What are you talking about?
[stammers, scoffs]

02:19:47.683 --> 02:19:49.903
What are they gonna
charge me with?
What could they charge me with?

02:19:50.077 --> 02:19:53.210
Ernest, I have many friends.
Many, many friends.

02:19:53.385 --> 02:19:55.517
That means I have
the best attorneys.

02:19:55.691 --> 02:19:58.433
They protect me,
and they're gonna protect you.

02:19:58.607 --> 02:20:02.045
So you don't have to worry.
Nobody's coming after you, Son. Nobody.

02:20:02.219 --> 02:20:04.744
Thank you, King.[groans]

02:20:04.918 --> 02:20:06.441
- What?
- It's a-- just a...

02:20:06.615 --> 02:20:08.182
What? What is it? What?

02:20:08.356 --> 02:20:10.358
His stomach's all torn up.

02:20:10.532 --> 02:20:13.753
- You all right?
- Yeah... [sighs]
...Myrtie's a mess.

02:20:13.927 --> 02:20:18.148
Willie is hysterical.
And I didn't--
I don't know how to-- [stammers]

02:20:18.322 --> 02:20:21.238
I don't know
what to do about it, but...

02:20:21.413 --> 02:20:25.155
[sighs] But you need--
You need to sign this here now.

02:20:25.329 --> 02:20:28.071
Something happens to you,
the headrights got to stay
in the family.

02:20:28.245 --> 02:20:29.986
This is the only way to do it.

02:20:31.945 --> 02:20:34.904
They got to stay in the family.
You know that.

02:20:35.078 --> 02:20:38.430
Well, well--
What if something happens
to me-- What...

02:20:38.604 --> 02:20:41.128
[chuckles] If something
happens to me, what?
What-- What would happen to me?

02:20:41.302 --> 02:20:44.348
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
It's just-- just a formality.

02:20:44.523 --> 02:20:46.176
Nothing's gonna happen to you

02:20:46.350 --> 02:20:48.831
because I'm gonna make sure
nothing's gonna happen to you.

02:20:51.051 --> 02:20:52.574
You, did you--
Did you sign this paper?

02:20:52.748 --> 02:20:54.968
Oh, yeah, he signed it.
Yeah, he signed.

02:20:55.142 --> 02:20:56.578
My wife's not sick.

02:20:57.492 --> 02:20:59.712
His wife's not sick,
but he signed it.

02:20:59.886 --> 02:21:01.409
We all have to sign this.

02:21:01.583 --> 02:21:04.978
This way, for sure,
the money stays in the family.

02:21:06.327 --> 02:21:07.589
Mmm.

02:21:09.156 --> 02:21:11.027
- Hmm.
- Hey, Son...

02:21:11.201 --> 02:21:12.333
Hey, Byron, give us a minute.

02:21:12.507 --> 02:21:13.682
Sure, King.

02:21:15.031 --> 02:21:16.119
[no audible dialogue]

02:21:17.686 --> 02:21:19.383
[Hale sighs]

02:21:20.297 --> 02:21:21.081
You all right?

02:21:21.255 --> 02:21:23.039
Yeah, I'm-- I'm...

02:21:23.997 --> 02:21:26.347
I'm-- I'm fine, I guess.

02:21:26.521 --> 02:21:29.829
Mmm. You're not afraid?
'Cause there's no reason
to be afraid.

02:21:30.003 --> 02:21:31.265
No. I'm not... [stammers]

02:21:33.528 --> 02:21:35.138
You giving her the shots?

02:21:35.922 --> 02:21:37.663
- Shots? Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

02:21:37.837 --> 02:21:41.014
Yeah, I'm doing wha--
I'm doing what I'm supposed
to be doing.

02:21:41.188 --> 02:21:42.189
Giving her all of it?

02:21:42.363 --> 02:21:44.060
Yeah. Yeah.

02:21:45.235 --> 02:21:47.368
You just gotta remember
to give her all of it.

02:21:47.542 --> 02:21:49.326
I am, King. I am.

02:21:49.501 --> 02:21:52.329
I'm doing like we said.
I'm keeping her--
I'm keeping her quiet.

02:21:52.504 --> 02:21:53.766
She's-- She's quiet.

02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:56.856
Well, just make sure
you do it. Hmm.

02:21:57.030 --> 02:22:01.600
Now, Ernest,
I know you love Mollie,
and I know I love her too.

02:22:01.774 --> 02:22:03.602
But the truth is

02:22:04.864 --> 02:22:06.256
she gonna pass on.

02:22:08.694 --> 02:22:10.391
You know that.

02:22:10.565 --> 02:22:13.002
There's nothing
we can do about that.
It's in God's hands.

02:22:13.829 --> 02:22:15.527
And he's waiting on her now.

02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:23.622
Now, you-- You got to stay
by her side and give her
this medicine to ease her pain.

02:22:23.796 --> 02:22:25.841
And you're never gonna regret

02:22:26.015 --> 02:22:29.410
spending this time with her
before she returns
to the eternal.

02:22:29.584 --> 02:22:31.281
You're never gonna regret that.

02:22:33.283 --> 02:22:34.720
And you're strong now.

02:22:36.069 --> 02:22:37.636
Right? You're strong.

02:22:37.810 --> 02:22:38.811
Yeah.

02:22:39.551 --> 02:22:41.204
Be there for her.

02:22:43.598 --> 02:22:45.252
And you need to sign this.

02:22:50.997 --> 02:22:53.695
You want me
- to sign that? Hmm.
- You have to sign it, Son.

02:22:56.045 --> 02:22:57.656
[clicks tongue] All right, King.

02:23:32.952 --> 02:23:34.083
Evening, boys.

02:23:35.171 --> 02:23:36.303
John.

02:23:38.087 --> 02:23:40.046
This is what I got so far.

02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:43.919
I was over in Ralston yesterday.

02:23:44.093 --> 02:23:46.574
I met this old-timer
by the name of Alvin Reynolds.

02:23:47.619 --> 02:23:49.359
Told me a lot.

02:23:50.491 --> 02:23:53.537
[Reynolds] I knew
every Indian they murdered.

02:23:53.712 --> 02:23:58.194
That bunch would give
poisoned liquor to dogs
just to see what would happen.

02:23:58.804 --> 02:24:00.632
They'd even kill coyotes.

02:24:01.502 --> 02:24:03.722
I don't care so much
about coyotes,

02:24:03.896 --> 02:24:07.247
but it ain't right
to kill 'em like that when
they could have a natural death.

02:24:07.421 --> 02:24:10.859
My son-in-law tells me
I ought to keep quiet

02:24:11.033 --> 02:24:13.253
or that bunch
will come after me
and kill me too.

02:24:13.427 --> 02:24:17.039
But my time is up already,
so I'm gonna tell you
who did it.

02:24:19.128 --> 02:24:21.391
I was sitting right here,

02:24:21.565 --> 02:24:26.396
and I saw Byron Burkhart
driving Anna Brown
right down this road.

02:24:30.096 --> 02:24:32.751
<i>Kelsie Morrison and his wife
was in the back seat.</i>

02:24:33.839 --> 02:24:36.842
<i>They took Anna and got her
good and drunk.</i>

02:24:37.016 --> 02:24:41.498
<i>And they were all together.
Kelsie, Byron and Anna.</i>

02:24:42.325 --> 02:24:43.587
<i>I ain't lying.</i>

02:24:44.284 --> 02:24:45.285
Kelsie Morrison?

02:24:47.287 --> 02:24:53.685
[chuckles] Kelsie Morrison runs
dope and whiskey from Fort Worth
to New Orleans to Dallas.

02:24:53.859 --> 02:24:56.688
You remember Bill Stepson,
the rodeo roper?

02:24:56.862 --> 02:25:00.300
Bill Stepson died
of corn whiskey.
There was no investigation.

02:25:01.127 --> 02:25:02.911
Bill's wife was Tillie Stepson.

02:25:03.999 --> 02:25:07.133
Kelsie drops his first wife Catherine

02:25:07.307 --> 02:25:10.571
and marries Tillie
two weeks after Bill dies.

02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:16.708
Two months after that,
Tillie dies from poison.

02:25:16.882 --> 02:25:19.145
<i>Kelsie runs off
with Tillie's kids
down to Mexico,</i>

02:25:19.319 --> 02:25:21.408
<i>but he comes back
'cause some smart lawyer
tells him</i>

02:25:21.582 --> 02:25:23.715
<i>he's gonna be
in much bigger trouble
if he doesn't.</i>

02:25:26.543 --> 02:25:30.286
So my dead wife has two kids,
and they have my name.

02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:34.029
So, if I adopted them proper,

02:25:34.203 --> 02:25:37.380
and if these two kids
were to die,
would I inherit their estates?

02:25:37.554 --> 02:25:39.252
They're Osage.

02:25:39.426 --> 02:25:41.950
Well, one of them's half Osage,
but they have headrights.

02:25:43.169 --> 02:25:45.824
Kelsie, you realize
that this indicates to me

02:25:45.998 --> 02:25:49.305
that you're planning on adopting
and killing these children?

02:25:49.479 --> 02:25:52.656
No, not if it's not legal
and I don't get the money.

02:25:52.831 --> 02:25:54.354
Then I'm not gonna do it.

02:26:03.015 --> 02:26:04.712
Kelsie Morrison?

02:26:04.886 --> 02:26:07.019
- Who?
- Kelsie Morrison.

02:26:07.193 --> 02:26:08.237
My name is Lloyd Miller.

02:26:08.411 --> 02:26:09.978
Oh. Oh, come on over here, Lloyd.

02:26:10.152 --> 02:26:11.806
We wanna talk to you about that.

02:26:14.766 --> 02:26:16.985
I always admired
Kelsie's ambition.

02:26:18.726 --> 02:26:19.988
Told him so, and he thanked me.

02:26:20.162 --> 02:26:22.774
Kelsie, I have always admired
your ambition.

02:26:22.948 --> 02:26:23.905
Thank you.

02:26:24.079 --> 02:26:25.472
What can you tell us

02:26:25.646 --> 02:26:27.735
about Byron and Ernest Burkhart
and those murders?

02:26:28.954 --> 02:26:30.390
Byron and Ernest Burkhart?

02:26:32.131 --> 02:26:34.089
I think we can
help each other out here.

02:26:37.701 --> 02:26:39.834
[John] <i>I'm in real good
with the people now.</i>

02:26:40.008 --> 02:26:42.576
<i>The Wahzhazhe,
they tell me things.</i>

02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:48.147
<i>I'm a trusted friend
of Father Albert too.
He confided in me.</i>

02:26:48.321 --> 02:26:51.063
<i>Told me everything
that was going on
with Mollie Burkhart.</i>

02:26:53.152 --> 02:26:54.631
<i>Said she fears for her life.</i>

02:26:57.199 --> 02:26:59.419
[White] <i>He say who
she was most afraid of?</i>

02:27:03.771 --> 02:27:04.990
[John] <i>Come on now, Tom.</i>

02:27:06.861 --> 02:27:09.516
<i>You got a better chance
of convicting a guy
for kicking a dog</i>

02:27:09.690 --> 02:27:11.083
<i>than killing an Indian.</i>

02:27:12.911 --> 02:27:14.086
[Mollie sighs]

02:27:25.749 --> 02:27:27.316
That's Bill Hale's ranch.

02:27:40.547 --> 02:27:43.158
I sold him
a $30,000 fire policy
last month.

02:27:44.768 --> 02:27:47.641
Well, Mr. Insurance Man,
looks like you got some work
in the morning.

02:30:13.047 --> 02:30:14.048
[groans]

02:30:16.442 --> 02:30:17.486
[grunts]

02:30:23.275 --> 02:30:25.016
You're next.

02:31:13.803 --> 02:31:15.066
[Ernest grunts]

02:31:32.692 --> 02:31:33.780
Well...

02:31:36.087 --> 02:31:38.089
here we go. [sighs]

02:31:39.133 --> 02:31:41.614
Here we go, huh? [sighs] Well...

02:31:42.832 --> 02:31:44.225
I got something to tell you.

02:31:45.008 --> 02:31:46.053
You, uh...

02:31:47.533 --> 02:31:52.146
I got something to tell you.
My wife's-- My wife's real sick.

02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:56.890
I got-- I gotta get home
and see my wife.
She's real sick.

02:31:57.064 --> 02:31:59.066
S-Son? Come-- Come with me now.

02:32:00.546 --> 02:32:05.855
Gotta go talk to my wife.
She's, uh--
She's not doing too well, so...

02:32:06.029 --> 02:32:08.249
We're gonna go home, and, uh...

02:32:08.423 --> 02:32:10.730
We're gonna go home and--
and take care of her, right?

02:32:10.904 --> 02:32:12.514
[White] All right, Son.[agent] Boy.

02:32:12.688 --> 02:32:15.909
[Ernest] You got this all wrong.
You got this all wrong.

02:32:16.083 --> 02:32:18.216
Whatever you think you know,
you don't know.

02:32:19.826 --> 02:32:22.176
Son, you go with him,
all right?[White] All right.

02:32:23.090 --> 02:32:24.918
My wife, she's real sick!

02:32:26.006 --> 02:32:27.225
Been real sick.

02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:37.887
[smacks lips] Can I, uh...

02:32:40.107 --> 02:32:41.326
Can I sit down?

02:32:43.502 --> 02:32:44.807
Standing's good.

02:32:52.902 --> 02:32:57.080
Wanna talk to you about
the murders of Reta and
Bill Smith, and Anna Brown.

02:33:06.699 --> 02:33:08.527
[groans]

02:33:09.876 --> 02:33:11.269
[groans]

02:33:13.096 --> 02:33:14.446
[fly buzzes]

02:33:18.580 --> 02:33:20.191
I need to sit down.

02:33:21.453 --> 02:33:24.020
Yes, you do.
But you're standing.

02:33:25.805 --> 02:33:27.285
I'm standing now,

02:33:29.069 --> 02:33:30.984
but I'm gonna have to get
some sleep.

02:33:33.204 --> 02:33:37.251
You can't be holding me
here like this...
[chuckling] ...much longer.

02:33:39.166 --> 02:33:42.256
Were you alone
when you put the explosives
under the house

02:33:42.430 --> 02:33:44.171
or was Blackie Thompson
with you?

02:33:46.652 --> 02:33:47.783
Who?

02:33:47.957 --> 02:33:49.394
Blackie Thompson.

02:33:49.568 --> 02:33:51.396
No. He was nowhere around me.

02:33:53.006 --> 02:33:55.008
Mm-hmm.

02:33:55.182 --> 02:33:59.491
I don't even know him so much,
just-- just from around town.
That's all.

02:34:02.929 --> 02:34:04.974
And did you put the explosives
under the house?

02:34:05.148 --> 02:34:07.542
I don't know nothing
about no explosives.

02:34:11.372 --> 02:34:12.939
[fly buzzes]

02:34:15.942 --> 02:34:18.597
[White] You didn't
rob a bank in Oilton
with him, did you?

02:34:19.119 --> 02:34:20.120
No.

02:34:21.991 --> 02:34:25.734
You did, uh,
help Blackie Thompson

02:34:25.908 --> 02:34:29.651
steal your own Buick in 1921

02:34:29.825 --> 02:34:33.481
for the purposes of
collecting insurance money
on it, didn't you?

02:34:33.655 --> 02:34:34.569
Uhm-uhm.

02:34:34.743 --> 02:34:36.484
- [White] You didn't?
- Uhm-uhm.

02:34:36.658 --> 02:34:40.053
I let him use my bucket
for a while, but that's--

02:34:40.227 --> 02:34:43.578
I told him he could
ride around. But, uh...

02:34:43.752 --> 02:34:45.188
[White] What did he want it for?

02:34:45.363 --> 02:34:47.495
I don't know
what he wanted it fer.

02:34:47.669 --> 02:34:53.240
[scoffs] That ain't my business.
Probably to enjoy hisself.
[chuckles]

02:34:53.414 --> 02:34:57.505
If a man wanted
to borrow my car, I might
ask him what he wanted it for.

02:34:57.679 --> 02:34:59.159
Hmm.

02:34:59.333 --> 02:35:02.684
Someti-- Sometimes people
just wanna take a ride.

02:35:02.858 --> 02:35:04.817
I don't ask no questions.

02:35:06.166 --> 02:35:10.910
So you loaned it to him?
You didn't ask him
what it was for?

02:35:11.084 --> 02:35:12.955
[chuckles]

02:35:13.129 --> 02:35:15.306
Yeah. [chuckles]

02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:18.221
[White] Just a neighborly guy.
[chuckles]

02:35:18.396 --> 02:35:24.880
[chuckles] You got me.
[chuckles] I loaned it to him.
[laughs]

02:35:25.054 --> 02:35:27.796
I loaned it to him. I guess
that's against the law, right?

02:35:27.970 --> 02:35:29.537
[chuckles][White] All right.

02:35:37.893 --> 02:35:39.460
How are you doing, Ernest?

02:35:43.856 --> 02:35:45.031
Blackie.

02:35:51.254 --> 02:35:53.474
[clicks tongue] Um, uh...

02:35:55.128 --> 02:35:56.869
May I talk to this man?

02:35:58.218 --> 02:36:01.526
May I talk to this man alone
for-- for a while?

02:36:08.054 --> 02:36:09.708
They got you turned around?

02:36:11.274 --> 02:36:12.667
Me turned around?

02:36:13.755 --> 02:36:15.757
No, they ain't got me
turned around, Blackie.

02:36:17.629 --> 02:36:21.850
Go on now. [stammers]
What'd you tell 'em?
What'd you tell 'em?

02:36:22.024 --> 02:36:25.854
I told them
when I came out of prison,
to make things right with you,

02:36:26.028 --> 02:36:27.203
you gave me $1.50.

02:36:28.553 --> 02:36:30.903
You just told us we all knew
the chances we were taking.

02:36:31.077 --> 02:36:33.079
Yeah, we did.
We knew the chances
we were taking.

02:36:33.253 --> 02:36:35.429
But I didn't give you $1.50,
I gave you a twenty.

02:36:35.603 --> 02:36:37.562
No, you didn't. It was $1.50.

02:36:37.736 --> 02:36:40.347
I didn't give you $1.50.
I gave you a t--
I meant to give you a tw--

02:36:40.521 --> 02:36:43.742
Nah, I did give you a twenty.
No, I remember now.
I gave you a twenty.

02:36:43.916 --> 02:36:45.396
- Bullshit.
- Listen.

02:36:46.222 --> 02:36:48.355
[clears throat] You gotta just--

02:36:48.529 --> 02:36:51.880
You gotta tell me
what you told them, Blackie.
All of it. What you tell them?

02:36:52.054 --> 02:36:54.143
- I told them all of it.
- All of it?

02:36:54.317 --> 02:36:57.364
I told all of it. I told them
how you and your uncle
are too much goddamn Jew.

02:36:57.538 --> 02:36:59.148
Jew?

02:36:59.322 --> 02:37:01.673
Yeah, I'm sitting here
doing life for
that Drumright cop.

02:37:01.847 --> 02:37:03.936
Well, I'm telling you
right now, Ernest.

02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:06.373
You can't handle
any prison, boy.

02:37:06.547 --> 02:37:08.288
You're better off
telling them what you know,

02:37:08.462 --> 02:37:11.465
for your sake,
for your family's sake,
and for your pleasure.

02:37:11.639 --> 02:37:14.337
Y-Y-You know something.
Youse is as dumb as a washboard.

02:37:14.512 --> 02:37:16.209
- You know that?
- Oh, am I?

02:37:16.383 --> 02:37:18.864
Yeah, you go on yapping
first chance you get,
huh, Blackie?

02:37:19.038 --> 02:37:21.301
We-- [whispering]
We were supposed to be partners.

02:37:21.475 --> 02:37:23.564
It ain't my fault
that you--Partners?

02:37:23.738 --> 02:37:25.871
It ain't my fault you got caught
with the car, you dumbbell.

02:37:26.045 --> 02:37:28.700
Call me a goddamn partner?
You didn't give me shit.

02:37:28.874 --> 02:37:31.224
Oh, let me tell you something.
Hale's got a whole plan.

02:37:31.398 --> 02:37:34.140
And I'm gonna talk to him,
make sure you ain't a part of it

02:37:34.314 --> 02:37:36.055
'cause you're so thick
in the head.

02:37:36.229 --> 02:37:38.536
He always said
you was thick in the head.
You know that?

02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:41.843
This is the plan.
I'm sitting here
because of his plan.

02:37:42.017 --> 02:37:45.020
[breathing wheezingly]

02:37:54.508 --> 02:37:55.857
[groans]

02:37:57.598 --> 02:37:59.295
[Hale] Mollie... [speaks Osage]

02:37:59.948 --> 02:38:01.428
[speaks Osage]

02:38:02.473 --> 02:38:04.257
[speaks Osage]

02:38:06.128 --> 02:38:08.087
[speaks Osage]

02:38:19.228 --> 02:38:20.708
[in English] I could be real.

02:38:34.330 --> 02:38:36.289
[breathing wheezingly]

02:38:39.771 --> 02:38:42.164
All right, all right.
That-- That's enough.

02:38:47.082 --> 02:38:49.432
Ernest, you're a good man,
aren't you?

02:38:50.956 --> 02:38:53.959
Yes, sir. I am. I suppose so.

02:38:55.308 --> 02:38:58.659
You suppose so? [stammers]
Are you or aren't you?
[chuckles]

02:38:58.833 --> 02:39:00.966
I am, sir. I am.

02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:02.750
You love your wife and children?

02:39:04.099 --> 02:39:05.318
Yes, sir. I do.

02:39:05.492 --> 02:39:07.581
You served your country
in infantry and--

02:39:07.755 --> 02:39:10.628
and I don't think
this is how your life
was meant to turn out.

02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:19.201
Now, it seems to me
your family back home,

02:39:20.768 --> 02:39:25.425
they're more of a blessing
to you than your uncle,
King Bill Hale.

02:39:28.559 --> 02:39:33.433
You and I both know
he presents himself
as a very righteous man.

02:39:36.784 --> 02:39:38.438
And that's just not who he is.

02:39:42.573 --> 02:39:44.313
He's done nothing for you, son...

02:39:46.315 --> 02:39:47.490
except...

02:39:48.666 --> 02:39:50.232
make you do bad things

02:39:50.406 --> 02:39:54.019
and take advantage of you
because of your... disposition.

02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:02.070
So what do you say
we start over?

02:40:06.771 --> 02:40:07.815
I, uh...

02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:13.473
I wanna get home to see my wife,

02:40:15.257 --> 02:40:16.607
so you, uh...

02:40:18.565 --> 02:40:20.306
you tell me what I gotta do.

02:40:24.049 --> 02:40:26.573
You know who killed Henry Roan?

02:40:33.667 --> 02:40:37.149
[children speaking indistinctly]

02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:40.326
Don't you run now.

02:40:44.373 --> 02:40:45.679
I'm here to take you in.

02:41:01.564 --> 02:41:03.871
[White]
<i>I understand you know something
about the Henry Roan murder?</i>

02:41:06.004 --> 02:41:08.571
Why, I don't know nothing
about it.

02:41:10.922 --> 02:41:14.186
Well, I have a man here
who says he's your friend,

02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:16.188
who says you do know something
about it.

02:41:17.580 --> 02:41:18.669
Who is he?

02:41:40.778 --> 02:41:42.431
So this is on my neck?

02:41:44.477 --> 02:41:45.521
[White] Yes, sir.

02:41:46.044 --> 02:41:47.219
[sighs]

02:41:52.833 --> 02:41:54.530
Get your pencils.

02:41:54.705 --> 02:41:57.185
[footsteps approaching]

02:42:10.285 --> 02:42:12.810
[in Osage]

02:42:13.767 --> 02:42:15.116
[in English]
Does she have a doctor?

02:42:15.290 --> 02:42:16.596
No. She won't see one.

02:42:17.379 --> 02:42:18.685
Let's take her.

02:42:18.859 --> 02:42:20.121
[Mollie groans]

02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:23.124
[Mollie, in Osage]

02:42:24.125 --> 02:42:25.213
[CJ] Ready?

02:42:25.387 --> 02:42:28.390
[Mollie breathing heavily,
groaning]

02:42:30.697 --> 02:42:32.177
[John, in English] Ma'am.

02:42:32.917 --> 02:42:35.484
[Mollie, in Osage]

02:42:36.529 --> 02:42:37.748
We're gonna get you some help.

02:42:40.185 --> 02:42:41.577
[Mollie groans]

02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:48.802
[Mollie wheezes, groaning]

02:42:51.805 --> 02:42:54.460
[doctor speaks indistinctly]

02:42:54.634 --> 02:42:56.549
- Mrs. Burkhart. Mrs. Burkhart.
- [Mollie breathing wheezingly]

02:42:56.723 --> 02:42:57.898
I need heroin, two milligrams.

02:43:03.686 --> 02:43:04.905
You want protection?

02:43:10.868 --> 02:43:12.739
- Mm-hmm.
- From who?

02:43:14.828 --> 02:43:18.353
From, um... From my uncle.

02:43:23.358 --> 02:43:24.925
- Hey, Harve.
- Bill.

02:43:26.318 --> 02:43:31.192
I understand I'm wanted. Well,
I'm here to turn myself in.

02:43:31.366 --> 02:43:33.020
Wh-- What you supposed
to have done?

02:43:33.194 --> 02:43:34.587
Killed somebody,
if you can believe it.

02:43:34.761 --> 02:43:36.719
Oh, now, Bill,
I wouldn't go that far.

02:43:36.894 --> 02:43:37.895
Arrest me, son.

02:43:38.721 --> 02:43:40.419
Uh-- We don't need to do that.

02:43:40.593 --> 02:43:42.464
Oh, it's all right.
Come on, son.

02:43:42.638 --> 02:43:45.424
- [journalist 1]
Mr. Hale, a statement?
- [journalist 2] Mr. Hale!

02:43:45.598 --> 02:43:47.121
What do you know
about the murders?

02:43:47.295 --> 02:43:49.428
Just a statement?
Just, "I'm innocent"?

02:43:49.602 --> 02:43:53.084
[Hale]
Innocent as a newborn baby.
Even more.

02:43:53.258 --> 02:43:54.433
[journalist 3]
Mr. Hale! Mr. Hale!

02:43:54.607 --> 02:43:56.391
When am I gonna
get to talk to my wife?

02:43:56.565 --> 02:43:58.524
You told me if I testified,
I could see my wife.

02:43:58.698 --> 02:44:00.831
Well, she is in the hospital
in Pawhuska right now.

02:44:01.005 --> 02:44:03.659
She's in the hospital?
Is she all right?

02:44:04.225 --> 02:44:05.923
She doesn't seem it.

02:44:06.097 --> 02:44:08.055
You tell her
I wanna get a letter to her.
I got a letter--

02:44:08.229 --> 02:44:09.665
[journalist]
Where they taking you,
Mr. Burkhart?

02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:12.451
I'm, uh--
I'm going the other way
for a while now.

02:44:12.625 --> 02:44:15.062
- [journalists clamoring]
- Where are they taking you, sir?

02:44:16.890 --> 02:44:18.805
Where are you taking me?

02:44:18.979 --> 02:44:21.460
We're not charging you
with anything because
you're going to testify.

02:44:21.634 --> 02:44:23.549
I know you wanna get back
to Mollie and the kids,

02:44:23.723 --> 02:44:26.117
but right now it's best
we take you out of state
for a while,

02:44:26.291 --> 02:44:28.119
keep Hale and his wolves at bay.

02:44:28.293 --> 02:44:29.337
Understand?

02:44:41.654 --> 02:44:44.135
[prosecutor]
<i>Just for the record, where
are you currently residing?</i>

02:44:44.309 --> 02:44:45.876
Penitentiary.

02:44:46.050 --> 02:44:48.530
[prosecutor]
- Serving for how long?
- Got a life sentence.

02:44:48.704 --> 02:44:51.055
- For the Drumright job, right?
- Yes, sir.

02:44:51.229 --> 02:44:54.232
And that was William Hale
that arranged that, right?

02:44:54.406 --> 02:44:58.453
That he did. Yeah, that he did.
Funny, ain't it?

02:44:59.324 --> 02:45:00.325
Take a letter.

02:45:01.456 --> 02:45:04.982
"Judge not" by William K. Hale.

02:45:05.156 --> 02:45:07.810
Who asked you to kill
Bill and Reta Smith?

02:45:08.855 --> 02:45:10.901
William Hale
and Ernest Burkhart.

02:45:11.075 --> 02:45:13.686
Have you had any recent contact
with Mr. Hale?

02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:16.341
Yeah, I have.
Matter of fact, I have.

02:45:16.515 --> 02:45:19.126
He got a note to my jail cell.

02:45:19.300 --> 02:45:22.347
- Asked me to kill
his nephew, Ernest.
- [expresses shock]

02:45:22.521 --> 02:45:23.914
Mr. Thompson.

02:45:24.088 --> 02:45:26.481
The vilest criminal
may rightfully demand a chance

02:45:26.655 --> 02:45:29.658
to prove his innocence
by a jury of his land.
Judge not.

02:45:29.832 --> 02:45:33.314
[Blackie] <i>Yeah,
he got a note to my jail cell
saying he could help me exscape.</i>

02:45:33.488 --> 02:45:37.928
<i>And when I got out,
take his nephew Ernest
to old Mexico and kill him.</i>

02:45:38.102 --> 02:45:42.193
I sent a note back
saying that I wouldn't testify
if he got me out.

02:45:42.367 --> 02:45:43.759
And how did that work out
for you?

02:45:43.934 --> 02:45:46.023
How did what work out for me?

02:45:46.197 --> 02:45:48.199
Mr. Hale's promise
for a grand escape.

02:45:48.373 --> 02:45:50.897
Shit, I'm sitting here
talking to you, ain't I?

02:45:51.071 --> 02:45:52.681
Damn, it didn't work out
too well.

02:45:52.855 --> 02:45:54.814
Judge not.

02:45:55.946 --> 02:45:57.382
Put that in
the <i>Pawhuska Daily Journal,</i>

02:45:57.556 --> 02:45:59.036
<i>Fairfax Chief,</i>

02:45:59.210 --> 02:46:00.907
<i>The Hominy Journal,</i>
and <i>The Osage County News.</i>

02:46:01.081 --> 02:46:02.082
Yes, Mr. Hale.

02:46:05.172 --> 02:46:06.521
Your mama's walking.

02:46:09.307 --> 02:46:10.830
Doesn't she look wonderful?

02:46:18.577 --> 02:46:19.970
Hold steady, son.

02:46:21.623 --> 02:46:22.885
Narrow is the way.

02:46:30.458 --> 02:46:33.461
[people murmuring,
chattering indistinctly]

02:47:03.665 --> 02:47:07.060
I demand to confer privately
with Mr. Burkhart!

02:47:07.234 --> 02:47:08.627
This is unheard of.

02:47:08.801 --> 02:47:11.151
- Ernest Burkhart is my client!
- [people clamoring]

02:47:11.325 --> 02:47:12.761
The rules prohibit this.

02:47:12.935 --> 02:47:15.808
I demand the opportunity
to speak with Mr. Burkhart!

02:47:15.982 --> 02:47:19.159
This man cannot represent both
the defendant and the witness.

02:47:19.333 --> 02:47:20.552
It is a conflict.

02:47:20.726 --> 02:47:23.642
He has been missing
for two months!

02:47:23.816 --> 02:47:28.168
And I have not had a chance
to communicate with him
before he testifies!

02:47:28.342 --> 02:47:30.562
This is tantamount
to witness tampering!

02:47:30.736 --> 02:47:34.522
Mr. Burkhart, is this man
really your attorney?

02:47:34.696 --> 02:47:36.307
[stammers] I don't know.

02:47:36.481 --> 02:47:41.094
[stammers] I don't have
a contract with him, but, uh...

02:47:41.268 --> 02:47:43.836
[stammers] I'm willing to sp--
talk to him. Yeah.

02:47:44.010 --> 02:47:47.535
- [people clamoring]
- The rules prohibit this,
Your Honor.

02:47:47.709 --> 02:47:49.885
The prosecution will not allow

02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:53.106
any conference between
Mr. Hamilton and this witness

02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:55.413
before the beginning
of these proceedings!

02:47:55.587 --> 02:47:59.199
- [crowd clamoring indistinctly]
- The Wahzhazhe people
deserve justice!

02:47:59.373 --> 02:48:01.897
Give him to us!
I'll be his executioner!

02:48:02.072 --> 02:48:05.336
Mr. Burkhart will be
remanded over to the custody
of the marshals.

02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:07.338
Marshals, get him out of here.

02:48:07.512 --> 02:48:10.732
Court is adjourned until
ten o'clock tomorrow.
Clear the courtroom.

02:48:10.906 --> 02:48:12.647
[clamoring continues]

02:48:14.127 --> 02:48:16.782
[insects chirping, buzzing]

02:48:33.015 --> 02:48:34.800
[Mollie sighs]

02:48:49.858 --> 02:48:51.208
[Ernest] I'm sorry...

02:48:53.645 --> 02:48:54.994
for all troubles.

02:49:09.574 --> 02:49:12.098
[in Osage]

02:49:16.407 --> 02:49:17.582
[speaks Osage]

02:49:27.505 --> 02:49:28.593
[in English] Brother.

02:49:29.985 --> 02:49:31.248
Brother.

02:49:34.468 --> 02:49:37.036
Freeling and Hamilton wanna
see you at Hale's tonight.

02:49:37.689 --> 02:49:38.907
Talk things over.

02:49:48.656 --> 02:49:50.658
[guests chattering indistinctly]

02:50:05.891 --> 02:50:07.240
Sheriff.

02:50:07.414 --> 02:50:08.415
[Harve] Ernest.

02:50:09.068 --> 02:50:10.330
[Ernest] Aunt Myrtie.

02:50:12.289 --> 02:50:13.899
[clears throat]

02:50:15.509 --> 02:50:19.818
Ernest, uh, you know
Mr. Solowey? Uh, Solowey Oil?

02:50:19.992 --> 02:50:23.474
And, uh, of course,
Mr. Kraceon, Kraceon Oil.

02:50:26.825 --> 02:50:28.261
Here. Come sit.

02:50:31.830 --> 02:50:33.179
[sighs]

02:50:33.353 --> 02:50:35.225
[Hamilton] If you testify
against your uncle,

02:50:35.399 --> 02:50:40.665
you realize that
this can be held against you
for the rest of your life

02:50:40.839 --> 02:50:43.842
and you can be convicted
for the Smith murder,

02:50:44.016 --> 02:50:48.020
spend the rest of your days
in prison? Do you see that?

02:50:48.194 --> 02:50:52.677
[stammers] No, I suppose
I didn't think that through
too much. But, uh...

02:50:52.851 --> 02:50:57.464
They're giving you
the rope to hang yourself.
Do you see that?

02:50:57.638 --> 02:51:01.033
[Freeling] He doesn't see that.
He doesn't see that.

02:51:01.207 --> 02:51:03.427
- [Hamilton] Ernest!
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:51:03.601 --> 02:51:07.039
If you do this,
you will be murdering
your uncle.

02:51:07.213 --> 02:51:10.608
Ernest, you wanna do that,

02:51:10.782 --> 02:51:14.220
have him die in prison? [sobs]
Do you, Ernest?

02:51:14.394 --> 02:51:18.485
No. Course-- Course
I don't want that, Myrtie.
You know I don't want that.

02:51:18.659 --> 02:51:22.446
Yes. You have all the power
to save his life.

02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:25.927
He is saving you, dumb boy!

02:51:36.547 --> 02:51:38.331
Do you wanna go home right now?

02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:40.333
Yes. Yes, I do.

02:51:40.507 --> 02:51:42.248
Wanna see
- your wife and kids?
- Yes, sir, I do.

02:51:44.598 --> 02:51:46.383
These government men,

02:51:47.862 --> 02:51:51.344
they beat you
and they tortured you.

02:51:51.518 --> 02:51:55.043
Well, no. No, they didn't.
B-But they-they did
keep me up for days.

02:51:55.217 --> 02:51:58.656
- [slams armrest]
- No! They beat you!
They beat you!

02:51:58.830 --> 02:52:01.485
Yes, they beat me.
- They beat me, sir.
- Thank you.

02:52:09.231 --> 02:52:10.407
[Mollie] <i>I had a dream.</i>

02:52:11.059 --> 02:52:12.104
[Ernest] Oh, yeah?

02:52:12.887 --> 02:52:14.628
We went to Colorado Springs.

02:52:16.543 --> 02:52:21.505
You told me all your secrets,
and I held them
in a box for you.

02:52:23.202 --> 02:52:26.161
Then we went to the river
and dumped them all away.

02:52:26.901 --> 02:52:28.033
[Mollie chuckles]

02:52:29.164 --> 02:52:30.601
We were happy there.

02:52:33.125 --> 02:52:36.520
Did I tell you
how beautiful you look now?
Look at you.

02:52:38.086 --> 02:52:39.131
[Ernest] Hmm?

02:52:39.914 --> 02:52:41.046
You're glowing.

02:52:42.961 --> 02:52:45.572
The insulin is working,
ain't it?

02:52:47.008 --> 02:52:50.360
I told you. You gotta get worse
before you get better.

02:52:52.492 --> 02:52:54.625
What's gonna come now?

02:52:54.799 --> 02:52:59.978
All I know, Mollie,
is it's-- [chuckles]
It's real complicated.

02:53:00.152 --> 02:53:03.155
White men's laws,
they're ju-- [stammers]

02:53:04.199 --> 02:53:05.592
Sometimes you gotta do
one thing,

02:53:05.766 --> 02:53:07.638
even though you mean
to do another thing.

02:53:09.161 --> 02:53:12.904
And I know that's hard for you
to understand as-- as Osage,
but, uh...

02:53:13.078 --> 02:53:17.952
What I have to do is go now
and tell the real truth,

02:53:18.126 --> 02:53:21.695
the real truth about
what these government men have
done to make me lie to them.

02:53:23.218 --> 02:53:25.351
You kn-- You know
they beat me, right, Mollie?

02:53:25.525 --> 02:53:27.179
They beat me. They--
They tortured me.

02:53:27.353 --> 02:53:30.835
They kept me up for days
so I would make up these lies

02:53:32.010 --> 02:53:35.317
and say that my uncle did
these awful things. It's...

02:53:36.884 --> 02:53:38.625
I'm in my right way now.

02:53:39.409 --> 02:53:41.585
I'm in my right way, and I'm...

02:53:41.759 --> 02:53:44.196
[clears throat]
...not gonna say those lies.
I'm gonna do the right thing,

02:53:44.370 --> 02:53:47.417
and I'm-- [stammers]
I'm gonna protect my uncle
'cause he needs protection.

02:53:51.203 --> 02:53:52.247
What?

02:53:54.380 --> 02:53:55.555
What is it?

02:53:58.558 --> 02:54:00.038
When will you come back?

02:54:05.043 --> 02:54:06.261
Couple days.

02:54:07.524 --> 02:54:09.439
I'm gonna come back
in a couple days.

02:54:10.657 --> 02:54:12.616
Now, listen,

02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:17.011
they're-- They're gonna
arrest me and all that
just to make a show of it.

02:54:18.273 --> 02:54:20.493
But I'm not in
any kind of trouble at all.

02:54:21.189 --> 02:54:22.321
None at all.

02:54:24.323 --> 02:54:26.586
I haven't done nothing wrong
in this world.

02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:30.285
They can arrest me
all they want.

02:54:35.465 --> 02:54:37.162
Just make sure
you know the road.

02:54:49.653 --> 02:54:51.393
You gonna testify for us?

02:54:51.568 --> 02:54:53.047
No, sir, I will not.

02:54:54.788 --> 02:54:57.138
You've decided not to testify
for the government?

02:54:57.312 --> 02:55:00.751
That's right.
What I told y'all
was a pack of lies.

02:55:00.925 --> 02:55:02.100
All right. You turn around.

02:55:03.580 --> 02:55:06.278
You're under arrest
for the murder
of Reta and Bill Smith.

02:55:15.330 --> 02:55:16.549
[car door closes]

02:55:18.203 --> 02:55:20.510
[prosecutor] So how did you
come to kill Anna Brown?

02:55:21.554 --> 02:55:23.687
I was hired by W.K. Hale.

02:55:23.861 --> 02:55:25.253
[prosecutor]
And what did he say to you?

02:55:25.427 --> 02:55:27.212
[Kelsie] I was to get
a thousand dollars,

02:55:27.386 --> 02:55:29.867
plus the money I owed him,
which was $600.

02:55:30.041 --> 02:55:34.001
So you say
- you killed Anna Brown?
- Yes, sir.

02:55:34.175 --> 02:55:36.003
You took her down
into that canyon there

02:55:36.177 --> 02:55:39.616
into what was commonly known
as the Three Mile Canyon,
didn't you?

02:55:39.790 --> 02:55:41.443
- Yes, sir.
- What'd you shoot her with?

02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:43.010
Automatic.

02:55:43.184 --> 02:55:44.795
And where'd you shoot her?

02:55:46.361 --> 02:55:48.625
Shot her down
through the top of her head.
Guess it killed her.

02:55:48.799 --> 02:55:50.104
[prosecutor] Mm-hmm.

02:55:50.278 --> 02:55:52.063
Now, you say
you were pretty drunk.

02:55:52.237 --> 02:55:53.804
Yes, sir.

02:55:53.978 --> 02:55:56.110
But you knew
you were killing her though,
didn't you?

02:55:56.284 --> 02:55:58.286
Yes, sir.

02:55:58.460 --> 02:56:01.942
And how did you get her
down into that place
where you killed Anna Brown?

02:56:02.116 --> 02:56:05.380
Mmm. Byron and I
carried her down there.

02:56:05.555 --> 02:56:08.383
And did you make her drunk
so you could kill her?

02:56:08.558 --> 02:56:11.169
- Yes, sir.
- Was she laying down
while you killed her?

02:56:11.909 --> 02:56:13.040
No, sir.

02:56:13.214 --> 02:56:14.825
Well, what position was she in?

02:56:16.087 --> 02:56:17.131
Sitting up.

02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:23.224
Byron raised her up,
pulled her up,
kind of held her up.

02:56:23.398 --> 02:56:25.357
So you stood there
and directed him

02:56:25.531 --> 02:56:28.099
how to hold this drunken,
helpless Indian woman

02:56:28.273 --> 02:56:30.014
down there at the bottom
of that canyon

02:56:30.188 --> 02:56:32.843
while you got ready
to shoot a bullet
into her brain?

02:56:33.017 --> 02:56:35.280
- Yes, sir.
- Then what happened
after that?

02:56:37.717 --> 02:56:39.284
Turned her loose
so she fell back down.

02:56:39.458 --> 02:56:40.894
Did she make an outcry?

02:56:41.547 --> 02:56:42.766
No, sir.

02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:46.117
And did you stand there
and watch her die?

02:56:46.291 --> 02:56:48.989
- No, sir.
- Y-You were satisfied
with your work?

02:56:49.163 --> 02:56:52.210
- Yes, sir.
- And you just turned and left?

02:56:53.037 --> 02:56:54.821
Yes, sir.

02:56:54.995 --> 02:56:58.520
Have you seen that canyon
where you killed Anna Brown?

02:56:59.609 --> 02:57:01.915
I've seen it a hundred times,
I suppose.

02:57:02.089 --> 02:57:05.397
A hundred times since.
You wanted to go back there and
see where you killed Anna Brown?

02:57:05.571 --> 02:57:06.485
No, sir.

02:57:06.659 --> 02:57:08.095
No?

02:57:09.140 --> 02:57:10.358
No, sir.

02:57:10.532 --> 02:57:12.230
Well, what did you wanna
go back there for?

02:57:13.753 --> 02:57:14.972
[chuckles]

02:57:17.409 --> 02:57:20.412
[chuckling] It's okay.

02:57:20.586 --> 02:57:22.066
You can tell the jury.

02:57:25.025 --> 02:57:27.158
Well, it's a good-- [laughs]

02:57:27.332 --> 02:57:29.726
It's a good place
to park and drink,
put on parties.

02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:32.163
It can't be seen
from the road, so...

02:57:35.427 --> 02:57:38.038
Where'd you go
after you killed Anna Brown?

02:57:39.039 --> 02:57:40.824
Went to sleep at Bill Hale's.

02:57:40.998 --> 02:57:42.782
Mm-hmm. What'd you do then?

02:57:42.956 --> 02:57:44.349
We stayed drunk.

02:57:44.523 --> 02:57:45.959
Where did Byron go?

02:57:47.395 --> 02:57:48.788
Back home to Mollie's.

02:57:52.139 --> 02:57:53.880
[grunts]

02:58:01.148 --> 02:58:02.236
Thanks, Mollie.

02:58:03.368 --> 02:58:04.543
You're welcome.

02:58:10.331 --> 02:58:11.463
[Ernest grunts]

02:58:17.077 --> 02:58:18.992
[Kelsie] Mmm.
Watch your step right there.

02:58:19.166 --> 02:58:21.821
[Anna] Watch my step.
If you brought me out here
to kill me,

02:58:21.995 --> 02:58:23.997
- I'll kill you.
- [Kelsie] No, come on with that.

02:58:24.171 --> 02:58:26.826
Sit down here.
You'll be more comfortable.
[grunts]

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.133
Okay, stop. Come on. Get up.

02:58:29.307 --> 02:58:32.614
Hold her up there.
Sit her up straight.[Byron] Sit her up straight now.

02:58:32.789 --> 02:58:34.094
[Kelsie] There you go.[Byron] Get up.

02:58:34.268 --> 02:58:35.748
Set her up straight now.[Byron] Yeah. I got her.

02:58:35.922 --> 02:58:37.707
[Anna] You wanna kill me,
I'll kill you.

02:58:37.881 --> 02:58:39.534
[Kelsie] There you are.

02:59:07.432 --> 02:59:09.913
[Mollie crying]

02:59:19.357 --> 02:59:20.706
Ernest.

02:59:21.881 --> 02:59:23.100
Wake up, Son.

02:59:24.014 --> 02:59:26.059
Yeah. [grunts]

02:59:28.235 --> 02:59:29.410
What? What?

02:59:30.585 --> 02:59:31.761
What is it?

02:59:35.590 --> 02:59:37.767
Well, there's no easy way
around it. Uh...

02:59:39.681 --> 02:59:41.118
I'm to tell you

02:59:42.206 --> 02:59:43.947
that your child has died.

02:59:45.557 --> 02:59:47.037
[stammers]

02:59:48.952 --> 02:59:50.431
What-- What child? What child?

02:59:50.605 --> 02:59:52.520
I don't know the name.

02:59:53.260 --> 02:59:54.784
Who? Is...

02:59:55.872 --> 02:59:58.352
Cowboy? [stammers] Which one?

02:59:58.526 --> 03:00:02.356
Is there a child
that had some lung trouble?

03:00:02.530 --> 03:00:04.358
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Like the whooping cough?

03:00:04.532 --> 03:00:07.535
No-- [stammers]
No, who told you this?

03:00:07.709 --> 03:00:09.233
Who-- Who told you this?

03:00:09.407 --> 03:00:12.236
It was one of our agents
there in Fairfax informed me.

03:00:13.585 --> 03:00:15.282
Mollie went to see to it...

03:00:16.675 --> 03:00:17.850
and take it home.

03:00:21.767 --> 03:00:25.249
There's no--It-- It's Anna.
It's Anna, ain't it?

03:00:27.904 --> 03:00:29.427
There's no easy way
around it, Son.

03:00:29.601 --> 03:00:32.125
No! Goddamn!

03:00:32.909 --> 03:00:35.781
[crying] They took my baby.

03:00:35.955 --> 03:00:38.349
[crying]
God bless you, Son. I...

03:00:39.959 --> 03:00:41.221
Sorry for your loss.

03:00:44.050 --> 03:00:45.225
[Hale] What happened?

03:00:46.313 --> 03:00:47.488
The baby died.

03:00:47.662 --> 03:00:49.534
- Which one?
- Little baby.

03:00:49.708 --> 03:00:50.927
The little one?

03:00:52.058 --> 03:00:53.886
Oh, my son. My son...

03:00:59.457 --> 03:01:00.937
Oh, my God.

03:01:01.111 --> 03:01:02.329
They took...

03:01:02.895 --> 03:01:04.157
[Hale] No.

03:01:05.593 --> 03:01:07.639
[Ernest crying]

03:01:07.813 --> 03:01:08.858
Ernest.

03:01:10.903 --> 03:01:12.296
Oh, oh.

03:01:13.210 --> 03:01:15.777
Little Anna's
with the Lord now, Son.

03:01:19.781 --> 03:01:20.913
Ernest.

03:01:22.088 --> 03:01:25.309
Lord, have mercy on us.
Lord, have mercy on us.

03:01:25.483 --> 03:01:27.659
Lord, Lord, Lord.

03:01:33.447 --> 03:01:34.753
Oh. [sighs]

03:01:43.893 --> 03:01:45.982
[Father Albert praying in Latin]

03:02:02.476 --> 03:02:04.957
[acolyte prays in Latin]

03:02:05.871 --> 03:02:09.657
[Father Albert prays in Latin]

03:02:32.028 --> 03:02:33.768
[sniffles]

03:03:15.071 --> 03:03:16.333
[sniffles]

03:03:35.787 --> 03:03:36.918
Hello, King.

03:03:39.399 --> 03:03:40.922
How's everyone?

03:03:42.968 --> 03:03:45.014
They're-- They're not good.

03:03:45.188 --> 03:03:47.059
I know, Son. I feel it too.

03:03:49.235 --> 03:03:51.759
[inhales sharply] You--

03:03:51.933 --> 03:03:56.590
You know I'm gonna
have to take care
of the two kids and Mollie now.

03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:59.245
[Hale] So...

03:04:00.638 --> 03:04:02.161
What are you--
What are you saying?

03:04:02.988 --> 03:04:04.685
You know what that means, right?

03:04:05.817 --> 03:04:08.863
Well... I'm-- I'm gonna testify.

03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:12.215
[clears throat]

03:04:13.433 --> 03:04:16.958
Well, that's a strong choice
to make against adversity.

03:04:17.133 --> 03:04:20.049
Mmm. Well... You sure you wanna do that?

03:04:20.658 --> 03:04:21.920
Yeah.

03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:25.793
Um, I have to, so...

03:04:25.967 --> 03:04:27.578
They gave you a deal?

03:04:28.666 --> 03:04:30.320
They gave me a deal.
- Yes, they did.
- Mmm.

03:04:31.103 --> 03:04:33.149
They won't hold to it.

03:04:33.323 --> 03:04:36.413
Yeah, well,
it's the federal government,
and that's what they told me.

03:04:36.587 --> 03:04:39.807
[chuckles]
It's the federal government.
That's why I say that.

03:04:40.939 --> 03:04:43.333
Uh, all this is not
gonna mean anything

03:04:43.507 --> 03:04:45.117
except the family's
gonna be broke up.

03:04:45.291 --> 03:04:46.553
Is that what you want?

03:04:47.511 --> 03:04:49.078
It's not gonna
make a difference.

03:04:49.252 --> 03:04:51.558
I tell you this
from the deepest part
of my heart.

03:04:51.732 --> 03:04:54.648
The deepest thing
that I ever know
in my life, my experience,

03:04:54.822 --> 03:04:56.955
is that this will not
make a difference.

03:04:57.129 --> 03:04:58.217
[Ernest] Hmm.

03:04:59.610 --> 03:05:02.265
You know things
are different now, right?
You know that?

03:05:02.439 --> 03:05:06.269
The Osage, they ain't gonna
stand by you. No one's gonna
stand by you no more.

03:05:06.443 --> 03:05:09.010
- Osage? They love me.
- No, they're not gonna listen.

03:05:09.185 --> 03:05:12.405
No. They-- They know. They know
who gave them the streets,

03:05:12.579 --> 03:05:15.843
who gave them the hospitals,
who gave them the schools.
They know.

03:05:16.017 --> 03:05:18.455
I've brought them
into the great 20th century.

03:05:18.629 --> 03:05:19.630
[Ernest] Mm-hmm.

03:05:21.458 --> 03:05:23.460
They're not gonna
stand by you, Bill.

03:05:23.634 --> 03:05:25.114
- Oh, yeah. No?
- No.

03:05:25.288 --> 03:05:26.811
They're not gonna
stand by you, Bill.
It's over.

03:05:26.985 --> 03:05:30.945
I mean, there might be
a public outcry for a while.

03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:33.426
But then you know what happens?
People forget.

03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:35.733
They don't remember.
They don't care.

03:05:35.907 --> 03:05:38.214
They just don't care.

03:05:38.388 --> 03:05:41.086
It's just gonna be another
everyday, common tragedy.

03:05:41.260 --> 03:05:44.524
Yeah, it's-- It's not common.

03:05:47.919 --> 03:05:51.270
Don't do something
you're gonna regret
for the rest of your life.

03:05:53.185 --> 03:05:56.667
You're gonna regret... I ain't got
nothing but regret, Bill.

03:05:57.929 --> 03:05:59.365
You have a family.

03:06:01.106 --> 03:06:03.935
Children. You lost one
already. Don't make it
more of a tragedy--

03:06:04.109 --> 03:06:06.372
[Ernest] It's already...
[whispers] ...a goddamn tragedy.

03:06:08.157 --> 03:06:09.941
I don't want you near my family.

03:06:11.769 --> 03:06:12.944
Not no more.

03:06:15.164 --> 03:06:16.904
Well, I'm sorry
- to hear that.
- Yeah.

03:06:17.078 --> 03:06:19.994
- It's over now.
- Please, don't
throw it all away.

03:06:20.169 --> 03:06:22.388
- No, I can't. I can't.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

03:06:22.562 --> 03:06:24.173
- No, I can't.
- I love you, Son.

03:06:25.304 --> 03:06:27.045
I can't, Bill. Can't.

03:06:31.049 --> 03:06:32.746
[Hale] Don't throw it away, Son.

03:06:36.794 --> 03:06:39.710
[prosecutor] Mr. Burkhart,
you're here of your own accord?

03:06:41.233 --> 03:06:42.539
Yes, sir.

03:06:42.713 --> 03:06:44.584
[prosecutor] No one
has promised you anything?

03:06:45.629 --> 03:06:47.761
No. No, sir.

03:06:47.935 --> 03:06:52.940
Did you seek out John Ramsey
at your uncle's behest
to kill Henry Roan?

03:06:57.118 --> 03:06:58.250
Yes, sir.

03:06:58.424 --> 03:07:00.861
Did you drive
from Fairfax to Ripley

03:07:01.035 --> 03:07:05.388
to tell John Ramsey
to tell Asa Kirby to do a job?

03:07:09.522 --> 03:07:11.829
- Yes, sir.
- And who asked you
to do all this?

03:07:13.134 --> 03:07:16.094
[stammers]
My uncle, William Hale.

03:07:16.268 --> 03:07:17.356
Can you see him?

03:07:18.836 --> 03:07:19.837
Yes, sir.

03:07:20.011 --> 03:07:21.621
Would you point to him, please?

03:07:22.666 --> 03:07:26.147
Yes, sir. He's right there.

03:07:27.888 --> 03:07:32.893
Let the record reflect
the witness has identified
the defendant, William Hale.

03:07:39.248 --> 03:07:43.643
And what was the job
that your uncle wanted Asa Kirby
to do?

03:07:45.950 --> 03:07:50.302
Uh, to... To blow up, uh,
Reta and Bill Smith.

03:07:51.129 --> 03:07:52.913
Why would he want them blown up?

03:07:55.220 --> 03:07:56.656
So to get their money.

03:07:58.354 --> 03:07:59.703
Are you a married man?

03:08:01.661 --> 03:08:03.663
- Yes, sir.
- What's your wife's name?

03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:08.146
Mollie Burkhart.

03:08:08.755 --> 03:08:10.322
She's Reta's sister?

03:08:11.149 --> 03:08:12.672
Yes, sir.

03:08:12.846 --> 03:08:15.022
She's also the sister
of Anna Brown, who was murdered?

03:08:19.244 --> 03:08:20.289
Yes.

03:08:21.333 --> 03:08:23.683
And her mother is Lizzie Q.,
who is dead?

03:08:26.599 --> 03:08:29.559
- Yes.
- And her sister Minnie
is also dead?

03:08:33.084 --> 03:08:34.564
Yes.

03:08:34.738 --> 03:08:39.438
And all these dead women
are Indian women, are they?

03:08:42.485 --> 03:08:43.573
Yes, sir.

03:08:46.576 --> 03:08:49.796
If Mollie, your wife, died,

03:08:51.232 --> 03:08:52.930
who would get her oil money?

03:08:55.106 --> 03:08:58.370
[sighs] Me and, uh,
our-- our children.

03:09:01.199 --> 03:09:04.681
Did your uncle present you
with a plan

03:09:04.855 --> 03:09:09.163
by which you would benefit
from the deaths
of all these Indian women?

03:09:14.386 --> 03:09:15.822
Yes, sir.

03:09:15.996 --> 03:09:19.609
And you helped your uncle
on your own making?

03:09:22.307 --> 03:09:23.352
Yes.

03:09:26.137 --> 03:09:29.967
And was part of this plan
that you would meet
and marry Mollie Kyle

03:09:30.141 --> 03:09:34.450
and kill her family and her
for their Indian oil money?

03:09:37.931 --> 03:09:39.193
No, sir.

03:09:42.283 --> 03:09:47.898
I met and married my wife
because I-- I picked her up
in my cab.

03:09:49.203 --> 03:09:51.771
You didn't marry her because
your uncle directed you to?

03:09:53.773 --> 03:09:54.774
No, sir.

03:09:58.778 --> 03:10:00.693
I loved my wife from...

03:10:02.347 --> 03:10:06.786
because that's what happened
to us when-- when
I picked her up in my cab.

03:10:20.626 --> 03:10:22.236
[footsteps approaching]

03:10:55.661 --> 03:10:57.576
H-How's my Cowboy?

03:11:00.492 --> 03:11:01.493
Well.

03:11:08.195 --> 03:11:09.849
He miss his pops?

03:11:11.329 --> 03:11:12.373
Yes.

03:11:14.114 --> 03:11:15.551
Elizabeth too.

03:11:20.033 --> 03:11:21.774
[breathing heavily]

03:11:21.948 --> 03:11:26.039
They, uh-- They know
what's happened?

03:11:28.346 --> 03:11:29.782
Not so much.

03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:44.318
Have you told all the truths?

03:11:46.582 --> 03:11:47.844
Yes, I have.

03:11:50.890 --> 03:11:53.545
[inhales sharply]
My soul is clean now, Mollie.

03:11:55.068 --> 03:11:59.377
It's, uh-- It's a relief to me
to be out from under all this.

03:12:02.989 --> 03:12:05.209
I wasn't gonna let him
get anywhere near you--

03:12:05.383 --> 03:12:06.906
near you and the children.

03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:11.041
[clears throat]

03:12:15.567 --> 03:12:17.221
What did you give me?

03:12:22.008 --> 03:12:23.140
What?

03:12:26.056 --> 03:12:27.666
What was in the shots?

03:12:36.545 --> 03:12:38.764
My medicine you gave me.

03:12:42.681 --> 03:12:45.075
What was in it, <i>Sho-mee-kah-see?</i>

03:12:54.563 --> 03:12:55.694
[scoffs]

03:13:01.439 --> 03:13:02.614
Insulin.

03:13:14.626 --> 03:13:15.627
[door closes]

03:13:26.638 --> 03:13:29.119
[dramatic orchestral
music playing]

03:13:33.471 --> 03:13:35.212
[radio announcer] <i>Right had won.</i>

03:13:36.343 --> 03:13:37.518
[music continues]

03:13:45.396 --> 03:13:47.616
True Crime Stories
has been brought to you

03:13:47.790 --> 03:13:51.968
through the courtesy of
J. Edgar Hoover and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

03:13:52.795 --> 03:13:54.231
This brings to a close

03:13:54.405 --> 03:13:57.190
the authenticated story
of the Osage Indian murders.

03:13:57.364 --> 03:14:01.107
As we take our leave
from Osage County, we conclude.

03:14:01.281 --> 03:14:05.198
The doctors, the Shoun brothers,
were never pursued
by the legal system

03:14:05.372 --> 03:14:08.201
for having certainly helped
poison Mollie.

03:14:08.375 --> 03:14:12.902
Ernest's brother,
Byron Burkhart, was tried as
an accomplice to Anna's murder.

03:14:13.076 --> 03:14:15.382
Kelsie Morrison said
at his trial...

03:14:15.556 --> 03:14:16.775
[imitating Kelsie]
Byron got her drunk...

03:14:16.949 --> 03:14:18.864
[gunshot fires]...and I did the rest.

03:14:19.038 --> 03:14:20.779
[playing dramatic notes]

03:14:20.953 --> 03:14:23.173
Byron was released
after a hung jury.

03:14:23.347 --> 03:14:26.655
William Hale, the ringleader
of the deadly plots,

03:14:26.829 --> 03:14:29.919
was found guilty and sent
to Leavenworth for life.

03:14:30.093 --> 03:14:31.921
- [metallic rattling]
- [creaks]

03:14:32.095 --> 03:14:35.707
He would write letters back home
to his Osage friends.

03:14:35.881 --> 03:14:37.927
[imitating Hale]
"Dear friends, how are you all?

03:14:38.101 --> 03:14:41.713
I never had better friends
in my life than the Osages,

03:14:41.887 --> 03:14:44.585
and I was a true friend to them.

03:14:45.891 --> 03:14:48.807
I'd rather live at Gray Horse
than any place on earth.

03:14:49.852 --> 03:14:52.463
I will be back with you
before many moons.

03:14:53.290 --> 03:14:56.032
How is my friend Dah-kah-hee-ke?

03:14:56.206 --> 03:15:01.037
Your true friend, W.K. Hale."

03:15:01.211 --> 03:15:04.257
Hale was released in 1947.

03:15:04.431 --> 03:15:09.088
The parole board cited
his record as a good prisoner
for his early release,

03:15:09.262 --> 03:15:11.134
but not everybody was happy.

03:15:11.308 --> 03:15:13.571
[imitating Osage chief]
This man, he is being released

03:15:13.745 --> 03:15:15.660
because he paid off politicians

03:15:15.834 --> 03:15:18.576
and nobody cares
about the Osage lives.

03:15:18.750 --> 03:15:21.971
Hale was not supposed
to set foot in Oklahoma again,

03:15:22.145 --> 03:15:24.713
but according to relatives,
he often visited them.

03:15:28.281 --> 03:15:30.849
What do you want for lunch,
William?

03:15:31.023 --> 03:15:34.984
If only that damn thickhead
Ernest had kept
his fool trap shut,

03:15:35.158 --> 03:15:36.768
we'd be in clover today.

03:15:36.942 --> 03:15:40.772
William Hale died
in an Arizona nursing home.

03:15:41.425 --> 03:15:42.905
He lived to 87 years.

03:15:43.079 --> 03:15:46.604
[playing dramatic notes]

03:15:46.778 --> 03:15:49.825
Ernest Burkhart was sentenced
to life imprisonment

03:15:49.999 --> 03:15:51.957
at the Oklahoma
State Penitentiary.

03:15:53.219 --> 03:15:55.047
[imitating prisoner] Aren't you
the one who tried to kill

03:15:55.221 --> 03:15:57.310
his "Injun" wife
for the oil money?

03:15:57.484 --> 03:16:00.270
Years later, he was granted
a pardon for his crimes

03:16:00.444 --> 03:16:02.925
and, once again,
moved back to Osage County

03:16:03.099 --> 03:16:07.886
where he lived out his days
with Byron in a trailer park
north of the city.

03:16:08.060 --> 03:16:09.409
[imitating Ernest]
Pass me a beer, Brother.

03:16:10.671 --> 03:16:12.456
[imitating Byron]
Got a light for my Lucky Strike?

03:16:13.239 --> 03:16:14.937
[pensive music playing]

03:16:17.809 --> 03:16:20.116
[radio announcer]
After Mollie divorced Ernest,

03:16:20.290 --> 03:16:23.554
she lived with her new husband,
John Cobb, on the reservation.

03:16:25.774 --> 03:16:29.995
She died of diabetes
on June 16th, 1937.

03:16:31.170 --> 03:16:33.782
Her obituary in the local paper
said simply...

03:16:42.268 --> 03:16:46.620
"Mrs. Mollie Cobb,
50 years of age,

03:16:46.795 --> 03:16:49.885
passed away at eleven o'clock
Wednesday night at her home.

03:16:51.756 --> 03:16:53.497
She was a full-blood Osage.

03:16:55.064 --> 03:16:57.806
She was buried
in the old cemetery
in Gray Horse

03:16:58.894 --> 03:17:02.506
beside her father, her mother,

03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:05.901
her sisters and her daughter."

03:17:10.296 --> 03:17:12.124
There was no mention
of the murders.

03:17:18.087 --> 03:17:20.176
[chanting, singing]

03:18:27.852 --> 03:18:30.028
[chanting, singing continue]
