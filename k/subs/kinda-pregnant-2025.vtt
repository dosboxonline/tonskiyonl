00:26.875 --> 00:30.415
Push, push, push!

00:30.416 --> 00:33.999
I can't do it! It hurts!
I hate you, bitch!

00:34.000 --> 00:34.915
Hey!

00:34.916 --> 00:39.332
Sorry, but the expectant mother
often lashes out at her support system.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.665
Lainy, why do we
have to play "mom" every day?

00:41.666 --> 00:43.749
I don't even want to be a mom.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.540
Never say that, Kate.

00:45.541 --> 00:49.499
Being a mom is the greatest thing
a human being can do.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.874
And someday, when we do it for real,

00:51.875 --> 00:53.749
we're gonna have to be there
for each other.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.165
- Because our moms are dead.
- Mm-hmm.

00:56.166 --> 00:58.958
Now hold my hand! I'm crowning!

01:03.333 --> 01:05.916
<i>♪ The hotel above and the street below
People come... ♪</i>

01:12.041 --> 01:15.165
<i>Lainy, did you call me just to yawn?</i>

01:15.166 --> 01:17.541
Kate, I can't dictate what my body needs.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.374
But you really think it's happening today?

01:20.375 --> 01:21.415
<i>Are you serious?</i>

01:21.416 --> 01:24.999
<i>He's taking you to a fancy restaurant
on your anniversary.</i>

01:25.000 --> 01:27.582
<i>He's going to propose!</i>

01:27.583 --> 01:31.374
I mean, he said he has something
very special to ask you. It's happening.

01:31.375 --> 01:33.957
<i>Oh, gosh! I can't handle it.</i>

01:33.958 --> 01:36.624
Okay, so you really think
today is the day?

01:36.625 --> 01:38.374
<i>I know today is the day.</i>

01:38.375 --> 01:41.207
<i>And today is also the day
that I find a gray pube,</i>

01:41.208 --> 01:43.207
<i>because I just found a gray pube. Wow.</i>

01:43.208 --> 01:44.290
Ooh, can I see?

01:44.291 --> 01:46.165
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay. All right.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.915
It'll make your bush look wiser.

01:47.916 --> 01:50.707
<i>Now this thing is going to look
like Steve Martin by the summer.</i>

01:50.708 --> 01:55.500
Goddammit. Mark, where are my tweezers
that are supposed to be just for me?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.166
<i>Oh, God, are you okay?</i>

01:59.750 --> 02:02.290
All good.
That's why I leave the pillows there.

02:02.291 --> 02:06.207
Found it. Sorry about that.
Had a nasty-ass ingrown.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.040
- Get out.
- Okay.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.082
Goddammit.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.415
Are you going to say yes?

02:11.416 --> 02:12.915
Uh, yes.

02:12.916 --> 02:14.249
Yeah, marriage!

02:14.250 --> 02:16.957
<i>I've been waiting
for this moment for so long.</i>

02:16.958 --> 02:18.250
Honey, it's happening.

02:20.083 --> 02:21.332
Do I have a mustache?

02:21.333 --> 02:22.791
<i>No, you're insane.</i>

02:23.375 --> 02:25.540
<i>No, do I have a fucking mustache?</i>

02:25.541 --> 02:27.499
I love you so much.
I'll see you at school.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.250
- Bye.
<i>- Hey, do I have a fucking mustache?</i>

02:37.000 --> 02:38.999
Oh my God, Mark? Mark?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.250
Yeah?

02:41.375 --> 02:43.457
Oh, this time you don't come in. Come in!

02:43.458 --> 02:44.625
Okay. Just...

02:48.208 --> 02:49.165
Oh...

02:49.166 --> 02:50.791
Oh, babe.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.790
- Oh my God.
- We're having a baby.

02:53.791 --> 02:55.208
We're gonna have a baby.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.375
Why is it wet?

02:58.041 --> 02:59.750
It's piss, Mark.

03:00.333 --> 03:06.875
"Oh, Romeo! Romeo!
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"

03:08.041 --> 03:11.124
"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,

03:11.125 --> 03:13.290
or if thou wilt not,

03:13.291 --> 03:15.124
be but sworn, my love,

03:15.125 --> 03:18.540
I'll no longer be a Capulet."

03:18.541 --> 03:19.916
Ms. Newton...

03:20.708 --> 03:23.540
I'm unbelievably uncomfortable right now.

03:23.541 --> 03:26.790
Okay. Thank you
for expressing that to me, Brett.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.499
Go ahead, take your seat.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.833
Now, does everyone understand

03:32.875 --> 03:36.040
what's happening in this masterful text?

03:36.041 --> 03:39.458
Yeah, Juliet's trying to smash.

03:40.958 --> 03:44.207
Yes. Very funny, Liam.
That is one way of looking at it.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.125
But it's more pure than that.

03:47.375 --> 03:51.457
These two people are in love,
and that's how you all got here.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.125
Your parents fell in love,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.458
and then you gave them
the greatest gift of all...

03:57.166 --> 03:59.375
when you made them mommies and daddies.

04:00.375 --> 04:01.750
You have a mustache.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.500
I knew it.

04:04.916 --> 04:06.915
Oh!

04:06.916 --> 04:09.875
Everyone, work on your summaries, okay?

04:14.500 --> 04:15.540
Hi.

04:15.541 --> 04:17.582
<i>Hey, smoke show,
I left my watch at home.</i>

04:17.583 --> 04:19.249
<i>Mind grabbing it on the way to dinner?</i>

04:19.250 --> 04:21.915
<i>Makes everything else I'm wearing
look a little better, you know?</i>

04:21.916 --> 04:24.083
Sure, I can grab it.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.207
Sounds like you want to
look really sharp for tonight.

04:27.208 --> 04:28.582
<i>I gotta look good for you, babe.</i>

04:28.583 --> 04:30.665
<i>Thanks for getting the watch.
I'll see you tonight.</i>

04:30.666 --> 04:31.666
You got it. Bye.

04:33.208 --> 04:35.250
You look happy. I don't like it.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.874
I think Dave's popping
the question tonight.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.540
Ooh!

04:39.541 --> 04:42.040
I guess I can free myself up
to be maid of honor.

04:42.041 --> 04:43.749
I can't do weekends, though.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.249
Yeah. I don't know
if you'll have to worry about that.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.749
What are you doing here?

04:47.750 --> 04:50.040
I'm a guidance counselor, so I'm guiding.

04:50.041 --> 04:52.000
A lot of lost souls in this school.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.249
If it wasn't for me,
it would be a shitshow.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.416
Hey!

04:57.625 --> 04:58.874
Where were you?

04:58.875 --> 05:01.791
You smell like cocaine.
I'll be back.

05:02.541 --> 05:04.165
We can talk about dresses later.

05:04.166 --> 05:07.000

Eight ball, nine ball?

Sorry. Hi.

06:28.000 --> 06:28.958
Don't get up.

06:29.583 --> 06:30.833
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

06:33.708 --> 06:36.708
Did you see
I had a little stumble on the stairs?

06:37.500 --> 06:38.458
A stumble?

06:39.708 --> 06:41.916
I think that girl tripped me.

06:42.875 --> 06:45.290
You look nice. I like the dress.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.541
Well, thank you. I'm a little tight.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.540
I feel like I'm breathing through a straw.

06:50.541 --> 06:53.541
But we're all going to end up
that way someday, right?

06:55.125 --> 06:57.666
I'm just joking about
getting old and dying.

06:59.291 --> 07:00.208
Let's order.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.333
Showtime.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.749
So, anyway, um...

07:09.750 --> 07:13.415
Four years, me and you, long-ass time.

07:13.416 --> 07:14.707
You're telling me.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.707
And I was thinking to myself,

07:16.708 --> 07:19.250
"Dave, it's time to level this shit up."

07:20.291 --> 07:21.832
- Yeah, level it up.
- Right?

07:21.833 --> 07:23.165
The champagne you ordered, sir.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.040
I got it, thanks. You guys can go.

07:25.041 --> 07:28.707
We're in the middle of
something really important.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.083
Let's go.

07:30.666 --> 07:35.416
Lainy... [clears throat] ...I want you
to make me the luckiest man alive.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.207
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

07:37.208 --> 07:39.208
Oh my God. It's beautiful.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.666
This is it, right? It's here?

07:43.333 --> 07:44.416
Aw...

07:45.291 --> 07:46.790
Where you at?

07:46.791 --> 07:48.874
What the... What are you doing?

07:48.875 --> 07:50.290
I am... I...

07:50.291 --> 07:52.624
Sorry, I thought...

07:52.625 --> 07:54.665
Um... I'm just really nervous,

07:54.666 --> 07:57.375
but say what you were saying,
don't worry about this.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.291
Lainy...

08:01.291 --> 08:02.458
I want us...

08:05.666 --> 08:07.250
to have a threesome.

08:09.166 --> 08:10.874
Uh, a what what?

08:10.875 --> 08:12.041
A threesome.

08:12.541 --> 08:14.290
Look, babe, our relationship is strong.

08:14.291 --> 08:15.707
Let's open it up, right?

08:15.708 --> 08:17.499
Oh, uh, this is Moira.

08:17.500 --> 08:20.791
Hi! Davey's told me so much about you.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.708
Oh, it's my dress.
I knew I left it over there.

08:24.375 --> 08:27.749
What the fuck, Dave?
I thought you wanted to get married.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.833
Lainy, come on.

08:30.333 --> 08:32.124
You can't have a threesome with your wife.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.332
- That's weird, right?
- Yeah, that's gross.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.415
Wife, weird. Girlfriend, cool.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.249
Anyway, I'm going to pay for this check.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.957
We'll go back to my apartment,

08:39.958 --> 08:42.791
chisel you out of that dress,
and see what happens.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.166
Lainy, what the fuck?

08:51.416 --> 08:53.166
Lainy, you are causing a scene.

08:53.916 --> 08:57.208
You want a scene? You want a scene!

09:01.250 --> 09:04.540
I'll show you a fucking scene!
You want a scene?

09:04.541 --> 09:07.624
Here's a scene
coming at you and your dress!

09:07.625 --> 09:08.958
Fuck you!

09:09.833 --> 09:10.665
Lainy.

09:10.666 --> 09:12.375
I didn't really eat dinner.

09:14.083 --> 09:15.000
Lainy!

09:15.666 --> 09:17.249
This food sucks.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.500
It doesn't have to be Moira!

09:31.333 --> 09:33.166
- Ms. Newton?
- What?

09:33.916 --> 09:35.708
Do you want me to hand out the quizzes?

09:41.208 --> 09:42.208
No.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.833
It's going to be an oral exam.

09:47.625 --> 09:48.458
What?

09:50.041 --> 09:52.749
I'm assuming
you're all familiar with oral.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.166
Little perverts.

09:56.625 --> 09:57.583
Brett.

09:58.916 --> 10:01.332
What is <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> about?

10:01.333 --> 10:03.708
Oh, um, it's a beautiful love story.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.332
Wrong answer.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.374
Boo. Everyone boo Brett.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.707
Boo.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.790
- Really "boo" him.
- Boo!

10:14.791 --> 10:17.458
Boo! Very naive.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.624
Who was it?

10:19.625 --> 10:21.249
Ah! Liam.

10:21.250 --> 10:26.999
Yes. Liam, will you remind us,
what is <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> really about?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.290
Romeo just wants a piece?

10:29.291 --> 10:31.957
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

10:31.958 --> 10:32.874
Right answer!

10:32.875 --> 10:36.957
Tell him what he's won!
A big fat dose of reality, kids.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.415
Because guess what?

10:38.416 --> 10:41.624
Romeo doesn't just want Juliet. No!

10:41.625 --> 10:45.290
Romeo wants pussy
from all over fair Verona.

10:45.291 --> 10:48.207
And he wants
a fucking threesome with Moira?

10:48.208 --> 10:51.208
Have you ever heard of Moira?

10:51.791 --> 10:52.999
What's a threesome?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.374
A threesome? Glad you asked this.

10:55.375 --> 10:58.624
Okay, everybody take notes,
because this is important.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.541
Get out your phone calculators
and whatever else the fuck you want.

11:03.958 --> 11:08.041
A threesome is when three people...

11:09.833 --> 11:14.499
do what only two people should do.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.915
Like a seesaw?

11:15.916 --> 11:18.124
Exactly like a seesaw!

11:18.125 --> 11:20.415
You know what?
Pass your books to the front.

11:20.416 --> 11:22.874
Everybody pass copies
of your books to the front.

11:22.875 --> 11:26.290
Come on, I don't have all day.
Come on, give me the fucking books!

11:26.291 --> 11:28.415
Let's go, let's go, come on!

11:28.416 --> 11:29.958
- Hurry up!
- I'm scared.

11:31.458 --> 11:35.125
Is this about your mustache?
'Cause it looks a lot better.

11:38.708 --> 11:41.082
This isn't about my mustache.

11:41.083 --> 11:44.875
This is about the fact that Shakespeare...

11:45.750 --> 11:47.000

11:47.875 --> 11:49.458
And love...

11:50.458 --> 11:53.000

12:10.708 --> 12:13.500
Um, Ms. Newton,

Hi.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.707
Oh, honey. I am so sorry.

13:15.708 --> 13:17.124
It's not your fault.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.166
Look at me.

13:18.750 --> 13:21.499
You are the moon. And the stars.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.707
And he is a dirty diaper.

13:24.708 --> 13:28.625
A tampon landfill monster.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.040
I just thought he was the one.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.624
You know, like the one, one.

13:32.625 --> 13:33.708
Fuck Dave.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.375
You don't need him or any guy.

13:37.291 --> 13:38.915
I want a family.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.165
That's my dream.

13:40.166 --> 13:43.082
You will have that dream. Anyone can.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.624
Anyone except for me,

13:44.625 --> 13:50.999
because Dave wants to explore
new vagina holes and butt holes.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.582
What about my holes?

13:52.583 --> 13:54.999
My holes aren't good enough
to shit a baby out of?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.082
Okay, can you stop saying holes?

13:57.083 --> 14:00.374
Sorry, it's just
thinking about a baby's thick head

14:00.375 --> 14:02.415
coming out of my hole is just too much.

14:02.416 --> 14:04.583
I can't take that right now.
Oh, thank you.

14:07.833 --> 14:10.540
You're not drinking. You look like shit.

14:10.541 --> 14:13.625
You don't want to talk about holes.
Are you fucking pregnant?

14:17.708 --> 14:19.415
- No!
- No?

14:19.416 --> 14:21.374
No! Get rid of it!

14:21.375 --> 14:22.499
What?

14:22.500 --> 14:24.749
No, I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

14:24.750 --> 14:25.874
I'm sorry. God.

14:25.875 --> 14:29.124
I just...
I thought that I would have a baby first

14:29.125 --> 14:31.832
and you would wait too long and, you know,

14:31.833 --> 14:34.249
try and adopt
and that wouldn't really pan out

14:34.250 --> 14:37.457
and you would just get
some weird pet, like, off-brand,

14:37.458 --> 14:39.707
like a ferret or some shit. I don't know.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.707
But I'm so happy for you.

14:41.708 --> 14:42.833
A baby?

14:45.458 --> 14:47.707
Lainy, I didn't want
to tell you right now.

14:47.708 --> 14:48.874
Please don't be mad.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.249
Stop! Why would I be mad at you?

14:51.250 --> 14:53.165
A baby. I'm so happy for you.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.500
Well, I mean...

14:55.375 --> 14:57.999
Yes, but you just demanded
I have an abortion.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.665
This is terrible timing.
I thought that you would be engaged

15:00.666 --> 15:02.957
and I'd be pregnant
and it'd be so nice, but I--

15:02.958 --> 15:04.832
No, it's fine. It is nice.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.166
It's amazing.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.375
You're having a baby.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.790
I know. It's so weird.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.166
So crazy.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.374
Thank you for knowing
I was gonna need to eat.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.666
Yeah, I knew.

15:21.166 --> 15:24.541
To just celebrating you
and not thinking about Dave.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.290
Hi, I'm Dave,
and we're the Threesomes.

15:28.291 --> 15:31.957
This is the first song
off our debut album, <i>Threesome.</i>

15:31.958 --> 15:33.500
It's called "Threesome."

15:43.041 --> 15:45.374
Are you sure
you're all good to be here today?

15:45.375 --> 15:46.374
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

15:46.375 --> 15:48.458
I'm, uh, fine.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.082
Being at work
is the best thing for me right now.

15:52.083 --> 15:53.874
Why would you want a family anyway

15:53.875 --> 15:56.915
when you're working
with these bleeding hemorrhoids all day?

15:56.916 --> 15:57.957
You heard me, Liam.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.790
You're the only teacher who can't swim.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.124
Lots of people can't swim.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.999
I'm gonna fuck his dad,
become his stepmom,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.207
and put him up for adoption.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.874
We're not supposed to threaten them.

16:05.875 --> 16:08.624
Lanes, this is me.
You got this, bitch. You're the GOAT.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.040
Don't talk like that in front of the baby.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.290
It's not even a baby yet,
it's just an embryo.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.832
It's not even an embryo,
it's just fermenting cum.

16:15.833 --> 16:17.915
It's just sitting in there like...

16:17.916 --> 16:21.249
Thank you so much for that visual today.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.207
Ha! <i>Golden Girls, Golden Girls.</i>

16:24.208 --> 16:27.165
Wow. How do you even know that show?
Aren't you too young?

16:27.166 --> 16:30.040
No, I looked up older lady references
so I could connect with you guys,

16:30.041 --> 16:31.707
my senior coworkers.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.832
Now, let me see the hand.

16:33.833 --> 16:36.207
I need to go live with this
to show my followers.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.625
- No, you don't need to see my hand.
- Let me see. Stop.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.290
Okay.

16:42.291 --> 16:44.082
- Oh, no.
- No, it's good.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.749
<i>Looks like I got some bad intel.</i>

16:45.750 --> 16:47.332
<i>No, it's actually really good.</i>

16:47.333 --> 16:50.332
I decided I wasn't ready to settle down.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.166
Really? At your age, honey?

16:53.541 --> 16:55.791
Because aren't you in your, like...

16:57.000 --> 16:57.916
...forties?

16:58.500 --> 17:00.832
Yes, I am. Are you okay?

17:00.833 --> 17:03.415
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine. Please.

17:03.416 --> 17:04.625
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.165
God, I hate her.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.291
She's the worst.

17:09.708 --> 17:12.833
It's like, look at that.
She's a teacher of children.

17:14.708 --> 17:16.499
Are you allowed to smoke in here?

17:16.500 --> 17:17.750
Yeah, it's just pot.

17:21.125 --> 17:24.082
Can you believe
that tarantula's gonna be a mother?

17:24.083 --> 17:25.582
Shirley's pregnant?

17:25.583 --> 17:26.625
Yeah.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.374
Her and Kate
will be together all the time,

17:29.375 --> 17:31.833
which frees us up
to work on our friendship.

17:33.583 --> 17:37.250
One, two. One, two.
One, five, six, seven, eight.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.082
No, no, no.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.791
Oh, God. Would you talk to me?

17:49.458 --> 17:50.457
Please.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.290
- Hi!
- Would you just talk to me?

17:52.291 --> 17:55.040
Lainy. Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

17:55.041 --> 17:58.290
- Oh, getting coffee. It's a coffee shop.
- You okay?

17:58.291 --> 17:59.999
- I'm good.
- Want to talk about it?

18:00.000 --> 18:00.915
- Nope.
- Chin up.

18:00.916 --> 18:02.874
- Okay, please get off of me.
- My God, sad outfit.

18:02.875 --> 18:06.000
I'm just catching up with a good friend,
so I can't really talk.

18:06.625 --> 18:07.707
Who's this?

18:07.708 --> 18:08.708
Um...

18:09.625 --> 18:10.582
Latte.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.541
- His name's Latte?
- Yeah.

18:13.250 --> 18:17.708
Yeah. It's, you know,
just spelled like latte.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.207
Would you please?

18:19.208 --> 18:21.040
I did not know
you were such a little slut.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.540
- Okay. Please.
- I love this for you. So proud.

18:23.541 --> 18:24.749
Okay. Thank you.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.999
No, I don't... want to do this.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.207
Can I use your bathroom?

18:29.208 --> 18:30.874
- Yeah. Right there.
- Oh, God.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.082
She stresses me out.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.250
Sorry, I work with her. She's the worst.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.915
She's always just,
like, talking to me, you know?

18:37.916 --> 18:41.332
Kind of like, I guess,
what I'm doing to you right now.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.750
Well, you gotta
pay that stuff forward, right?

18:46.166 --> 18:47.250
Wait a second.

18:47.833 --> 18:48.749
Old Navy?

18:48.750 --> 18:52.208
Oh my gosh. This is really amazing.

18:52.958 --> 18:54.208
Are you my mirror?

18:56.333 --> 18:59.582
- No, it's not good.
- We got to work on our mirror work.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.665
Look, I don't want to upset you,

19:01.666 --> 19:05.665
but Old Navy is in no way
affiliated with the Navy.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.874
- What?
- I know, I'm so sorry.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.665
- Oh, no.
- Somebody had to tell you.

19:09.666 --> 19:11.125
You're old enough to know now.

19:11.708 --> 19:15.124
I have to stop thanking
all their employees for their service.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.958
Yeah, and applying for veterans' benefits.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.374
What is your name again?

19:19.375 --> 19:20.457
My name is Latte.

19:20.458 --> 19:23.582
- No, stop. What was your real name?
- My name is Josh.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.500
- Josh?
- Yeah.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.041
Well...

19:29.791 --> 19:31.040
Black cold brew for Josh.

19:31.041 --> 19:33.165
- That's me.
- Cold brew in the winter?

19:33.166 --> 19:35.582
- And...
- You don't have to say it. I'm right here.

19:35.583 --> 19:37.540
- You don't--
- Kid's hot chocolate with...

19:37.541 --> 19:39.665
...a crazy-slash-ridiculous amount
of whipped cream.

19:39.666 --> 19:42.082
So much whipped cream that
it's pretty much a milkshake.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.291
For Sasha Fierce.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.916
- Wow.
- Thank you. Very thorough.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.624
You can give them any name you want.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.124
I'm trying to live out loud.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.540
- Well, that's deafening.
- Yeah.

19:52.541 --> 19:54.040
Yeah.

19:54.041 --> 19:56.124
All right. I'm going this way, which...

19:56.125 --> 19:57.790
- I'm over here.
- All right.

19:57.791 --> 19:59.415
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

19:59.416 --> 20:01.250
See you when we're both swabbing the deck.

20:01.833 --> 20:02.958
What's that?

20:04.083 --> 20:07.624
I was going for another Old Navy... bit.

20:07.625 --> 20:10.124
Oh, yeah. Uh, anchors away. Land ho!

20:10.125 --> 20:11.458
What'd you call me?

20:12.083 --> 20:15.333
Oh! Sorry. Land sophisticated lady.

20:17.791 --> 20:18.749
Bye, Latte.

20:18.750 --> 20:19.916
Ms. Fierce.

20:28.750 --> 20:31.499
Everything's so soft here.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.583
I know.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.791
Oh, God, these mannequins
are really freaking me out.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.500
That's what you're going to look like.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.374
I'm with child.

20:41.375 --> 20:42.999
- Sanpellegrino.
- Thank you.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.166
Thank you.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.915
Man, my boobs really hurt.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.124
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.375
And I can't stop puking.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.833
- Oh, that's cute.
- Gross.

20:56.916 --> 20:59.708
Does it look like
"picking up the boys from soccer"?

21:03.000 --> 21:06.999
You know, this store is just...
It's a little much, right?

21:07.000 --> 21:10.832
Yeah, no, it's like, it's awful.
We didn't have to do this.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.415
You dragged me in here.
I wanted to get a pedicure.

21:13.416 --> 21:14.624
No, no, no.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.124
I just want you to see
how supportive I am.

21:17.125 --> 21:20.374
And you are.
I always feel supported by you.

21:20.375 --> 21:22.915
If this is too hard, that's okay.

21:22.916 --> 21:24.957
No, it's not tough for me.

21:24.958 --> 21:26.207
I've just...

21:26.208 --> 21:29.666
I've been feeling
a little lonely lately, but I, uh...

21:30.833 --> 21:33.832
You know, you probably
don't even remember what that's like.

21:33.833 --> 21:37.624
Uh, married people can feel very lonely.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.665
I have been really horny, though.

21:39.666 --> 21:43.040
- Really?
- I can't stop masturbating to weird stuff.

21:43.041 --> 21:43.957
Oh.

21:43.958 --> 21:46.749
- Like <i>The Golden Bachelor.</i>
- Yeah?

21:46.750 --> 21:49.207
Something about it.
Maybe because my dad left?

21:49.208 --> 21:53.708
Okay. You know,
we should have more, like, secrets.

21:54.458 --> 21:56.332
What's wrong?

21:56.333 --> 21:58.791
- I'm gonna throw up my acai bowl.
- Oh.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.875
- You want me to hold your hair?
- No. I'm okay.

22:44.541 --> 22:48.665
Yeah. I'm 11 months, he won't come out.

22:48.666 --> 22:51.374
I'm gonna start charging him rent.
It's so hard.

22:51.375 --> 22:54.165
Miss, are you all right in there?
Do you need another size?

22:54.166 --> 22:55.915
No, I don't. Thank you.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.875
Oh, sweetheart.

22:58.625 --> 23:02.540
I know. You're adjusting
to the changes your body is going through.

23:02.541 --> 23:05.415
Just remember, this is a gift.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.832
You and your husband must be so excited.

23:07.833 --> 23:10.375
Or your wife. Or your...

23:12.291 --> 23:14.583
DoorDash driver.

23:15.166 --> 23:16.040
Oh.

23:16.041 --> 23:18.790
Uh, can I have a moment?
Can we have a moment?

23:18.791 --> 23:21.915
Women are miracles. How far along are you?

23:21.916 --> 23:24.832
Maybe, judging by
your facial bloating, five months?

23:24.833 --> 23:26.832
- I'll break your fucking neck.
- What was that?

23:26.833 --> 23:28.749
I've been a freaking wreck.

23:28.750 --> 23:32.207
Well, I would be too
if my ankles were that big.

23:32.208 --> 23:34.458
So how long have you been pregnant?

23:36.708 --> 23:40.374
Thanksgiving. It's my favorite parade.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.290
What?

23:41.291 --> 23:44.540
I'm gonna go and get you a burrito,
and then I'm gonna rub your feet.

23:44.541 --> 23:46.624
- You need to be pampered.
- Yes, I do.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.874
- Okay, stay right there.
- Yes. I will.

23:48.875 --> 23:49.958
Okay.

23:53.625 --> 23:54.625
Lainy?

24:00.291 --> 24:02.624
- Come on.
- Do I have anything on my face?

24:02.625 --> 24:05.291
No, you're great.
You know, everyone likes water.

24:28.375 --> 24:29.665
<i>Hey, you've reached Dave.</i>

24:29.666 --> 24:31.207
- <i>And Moira.</i>
- <i>And Andy.</i>

24:31.208 --> 24:32.916
<i>We're busy right now.</i>

24:33.625 --> 24:34.582
<i>Leave a message.</i>

24:34.583 --> 24:36.125
<i>Get your finger out of there.</i>

24:45.500 --> 24:46.333
Hi!

24:48.041 --> 24:49.790
- I heard you coming.
- How you doing?

24:49.791 --> 24:51.082
- Oh, my gosh.
- You good?

24:51.083 --> 24:52.375
Yeah. I'm good.

24:53.333 --> 24:55.375
I texted you last night. Did you get it?

25:01.791 --> 25:05.916
Mmm! So great. You guys do a great job.

25:55.708 --> 25:57.165
Mazel, mazel, mazel.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.499
Thank you.

25:58.500 --> 25:59.915
Congratulations, Mama.

25:59.916 --> 26:01.333
Oh, thanks.

26:05.958 --> 26:07.040
Looking good, Mama.

26:07.041 --> 26:08.207
Oh!

26:08.208 --> 26:09.375
Thanks.

26:10.416 --> 26:12.375
Bro, move, she's pregnant.

26:20.166 --> 26:21.166
Pregnant.

26:22.708 --> 26:27.333
<i>The next stop
is Metropolitan Avenue/Lorimer Street.</i>

26:35.333 --> 26:36.290
Oh, oh.

26:36.291 --> 26:37.375
Thanks, yeah.

26:41.541 --> 26:43.416
- You look so beautiful.
- Yeah.

26:44.375 --> 26:46.208
Oh, thank you.

26:46.791 --> 26:49.250
It's like your skin is glowing.

26:49.916 --> 26:50.916
Wow.

26:51.666 --> 26:53.875
It's probably because I'm pregnant.

26:54.916 --> 26:56.874
Mom, I want to get pregnant.

26:56.875 --> 26:59.915
- I want to get pregnant tonight.
- What? No, no, you don't.

26:59.916 --> 27:02.958
- Not when you're 15.
- You never let me do anything!

27:06.083 --> 27:07.083
Sorry.

27:07.666 --> 27:09.083
Fuck you.

27:15.166 --> 27:16.541
Hey. Thanks.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.416
Everyone settle.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.415
Mamaste.

27:36.416 --> 27:41.707
Let's all take a slow breath
into our space of motherhood.

27:41.708 --> 27:44.208
Inhale and pull up from the vagina.

27:45.875 --> 27:49.625
And exhale through your butthole.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.999
Up, up, up through the vagina.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.916
And out the anus butt.

28:04.666 --> 28:06.707
Now open your eyes.

28:06.708 --> 28:08.124
Welcome.

28:08.125 --> 28:10.707
Before we begin, any new mamas here today?

28:10.708 --> 28:12.540
There's a new next to me.

28:12.541 --> 28:13.624
Mamaste.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.874
- Mamaste.
- Mamaste.

28:15.875 --> 28:18.499
Mama some. Moccasin.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.541
How many weeks are you?

28:22.291 --> 28:23.915
We do the Mayan calendar,

28:23.916 --> 28:27.457
so it's like Labor Day, leap year,

28:27.458 --> 28:28.625
Thanksgiving.

28:29.291 --> 28:32.165
Sorry, I'm in my space still,
but do your class.

28:32.166 --> 28:34.500
Let's keep those in now.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.915
You are so very welcome here today.

28:37.916 --> 28:42.041
Now let's all get into happy baby
or whatever pose feels right to you.

29:05.791 --> 29:06.833
Okay...

29:10.916 --> 29:11.791
Hmm... Oh!

29:12.791 --> 29:15.832
Holy fuck! Oh, God.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.415
I'm okay. I'm fine.

29:17.416 --> 29:20.415
- Please don't touch me.
- I just want to make sure that the baby--

29:20.416 --> 29:22.540
Hey, hey, step away from her.

29:22.541 --> 29:24.583
If she wants help, she will ask.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.625
Hey, hey.

29:36.125 --> 29:39.499
Thank you so much
for standing up for me in there.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.207
Of course. Are you okay?

29:41.208 --> 29:42.707
Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Yeah.

29:42.708 --> 29:45.374
The energy in there
was just like a little nuts.

29:45.375 --> 29:48.207
- Right, yeah.
- Thought I would try the yoga thing...

29:48.208 --> 29:50.499
...but that was obviously not for me.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.915
It smelled like
a fucking queef salad in there.

29:53.916 --> 29:55.374
Yeah, it did.

29:55.375 --> 29:57.125
Right? It's disgusting.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.332
- Yeah. I'm Megan.
- Lainy.

29:59.333 --> 30:03.332
Ugh, my hormones are out of control,
and my husband is driving me insane.

30:03.333 --> 30:04.874
I'm sure I don't have to tell you.

30:04.875 --> 30:09.416
Well, actually, I don't have a husband,
so you probably do have to tell me.

30:10.583 --> 30:12.291
Oh, because I...

30:13.291 --> 30:15.040
We're not together.

30:15.041 --> 30:17.957
I'm single, doing it alone.

30:17.958 --> 30:19.790
Bless you, that is so brave.

30:19.791 --> 30:21.541
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:22.166 --> 30:24.374
How's it going?
How's your pregnancy going?

30:24.375 --> 30:25.541
Perfect...

30:27.333 --> 30:29.749
...ly sucky.

30:29.750 --> 30:30.957
- God, it sucks.
- Yeah.

30:30.958 --> 30:34.374
Right? I hope this little shit
appreciates everything I'm going through.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.457
- Well, it won't.
- Right.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.416
How are your nipples?

30:37.291 --> 30:38.124
Real big.

30:38.125 --> 30:40.458
No, no, no, I meant, are they dry?

30:41.250 --> 30:42.832
Because mine are like scones.

30:42.833 --> 30:45.915
So dry. I thought it was the only one.

30:45.916 --> 30:47.665
No, I have the best nipple balm.

30:47.666 --> 30:49.082
Really? Wow.

30:49.083 --> 30:52.165
- You should get some of this.
- Oh my God. Yes. Thank you so much.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.416
God, I need it.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.915
Ugh!

30:55.916 --> 30:57.332
Is that a normal amount or...

30:57.333 --> 30:59.790
A little bit actually
does go a pretty long way...

30:59.791 --> 31:01.290
- ...but that's okay.
- Thank God.

31:01.291 --> 31:03.916
Oh, little bit? Okay.
I'll put the rest of it back.

31:04.708 --> 31:06.332
Actually, why don't you keep it?

31:06.333 --> 31:08.165
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, totally.

31:08.166 --> 31:09.374
- That's so nice.
- Yeah.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.457
I wish I had something cool to give you.

31:11.458 --> 31:12.915
- You're so funny.
- Thank you.

31:12.916 --> 31:14.832
Is it weird if I ask you to hang out?

31:14.833 --> 31:16.665
No, no, I would love to hang out.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.124
- Amazing.
- Yes.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.874
Oh, fancy seeing you here.

31:19.875 --> 31:23.665
- There's my guys.
- Oh my God. So cute.

31:23.666 --> 31:25.124
- Yeah.
- Hi.

31:25.125 --> 31:27.999
Cute little face
almost tore my asshole open.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.332
Why don't you come over
for dinner this week?

31:30.333 --> 31:31.832
- Hey!
- Put yourself in. Here.

31:31.833 --> 31:33.790
- Okay.
- And I'm Steve, by the way.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.332
- Hi.
- Sorry, my husband, Steve.

31:35.333 --> 31:36.415
Congratulations.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.791
On what?

31:38.541 --> 31:41.166
On being preg... pregnant?

31:41.875 --> 31:44.290
Oh, yeah, I am pregnant.

31:44.291 --> 31:46.541
- Oh...
- Sorry, I...

31:47.125 --> 31:50.416
Pregnant, loving it, but hating it.
Ugh! God.

31:51.541 --> 31:53.415
- Right?
- All right. Well, we'll see you later.

31:53.416 --> 31:54.790
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

31:54.791 --> 31:56.790
Nice to meet you. Bye, little cutie.

31:56.791 --> 31:58.540
Why are you so early?

31:58.541 --> 31:59.582
Was that early?

31:59.583 --> 32:01.333
What the fuck am I doing?

32:09.791 --> 32:11.749
Thanks for coming to this.

32:11.750 --> 32:13.582
Hey, I want to spend time with you.

32:13.583 --> 32:17.791
If that means I'm going to Shirley's
corny gender reveal party, so be it.

32:19.958 --> 32:22.915
So, I was thinking about your baby shower,

32:22.916 --> 32:26.540
and I think we should do, like,
a <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> theme.

32:26.541 --> 32:30.582
- Like, big hair, long nails.
- Yeah?

32:30.583 --> 32:32.332
- Like, really go for it.
- Yeah.

32:32.333 --> 32:36.750
Well, um, it's just going to
have to be a joint baby shower.

32:37.458 --> 32:38.333
Joint with who?

32:40.958 --> 32:44.457
Oh, my God, you're so pretty! Oh, oh...

32:44.458 --> 32:46.540
Sad. Your life.

32:46.541 --> 32:47.499
Okay.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.915
I'm so proud of you.

32:48.916 --> 32:51.874
Wait, come outside.
We are about to do the reveal. Ah, ah!

32:51.875 --> 32:53.915
- So squishy. Okay, come on, guys.
- Okay.

32:53.916 --> 32:56.207
Piñata time! Let's go.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.790
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

32:58.791 --> 33:01.957
Gather round, mother fingerers,
I want to make a toast.

33:01.958 --> 33:05.749
Well, looks like
I got my baby girl pregnant.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.082
Whoopsie daisy.

33:08.083 --> 33:10.957
Turns out my scrote gravy's
more potent than I thought,

33:10.958 --> 33:13.540
shooting premium gasolina.

33:13.541 --> 33:16.457
This guy's the reason
there's so many lesbians now.

33:16.458 --> 33:18.874
All right, should we fuck up
this baby or what?

33:18.875 --> 33:21.624
Hold on! I want to do a speech.

33:21.625 --> 33:22.832
It's my time, baby.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.332
- Yeah, go ahead.
- I love you.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.707
- I love you.
- I love you.

33:25.708 --> 33:26.874
Aw.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.207
- I'm going to go kill myself.
- No, no, no.

33:29.208 --> 33:32.457
So, we weren't sure if it should be
Rawn or me who whack the piñata

33:32.458 --> 33:34.124
to reveal our baby's gender.

33:34.125 --> 33:37.082
But we have finally decided that the honor

33:37.083 --> 33:40.249
should go to someone who's gone through
some really tough times lately.

33:40.250 --> 33:43.832
So, I thought this might lift
that 200-pound spirit off the ground.

33:43.833 --> 33:46.708
Lainy, get up here and whack this baby!

33:48.208 --> 33:49.582
- Lucky.
- Stop.

33:49.583 --> 33:52.040
Uh, yeah, I'd rather not.

33:52.041 --> 33:53.000
Boo!

33:54.916 --> 33:56.707
Go. Come on.

33:56.708 --> 33:58.790
Okay, got it. Thank you.

33:58.791 --> 34:00.916
- Yeah, give it a whack!
- Okay.

34:02.458 --> 34:05.541
Okay, I really don't understand
why I'm the one doing this.

34:08.333 --> 34:09.625
Fuck the haters.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.916
I'm okay. I'm okay.

34:16.541 --> 34:18.540
- Oh my God!
- She can't swim!

34:18.541 --> 34:20.416
- Shit.
- She can't swim!

34:21.458 --> 34:22.583
Hang on!

34:23.416 --> 34:26.540
It's a girl! It's red inside!

34:26.541 --> 34:30.166
It's blood! That's your blood!

34:31.041 --> 34:32.499
Whoo!

34:32.500 --> 34:33.583
I'm gonna...

34:34.708 --> 34:36.666
- Oh, God.
- Fuck you, Lainy!

34:50.500 --> 34:51.875
<i>She can't swim!</i>

34:53.250 --> 34:54.832
- Lainy, hi.
- Hi.

34:54.833 --> 34:56.832
- Come in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.249
- Oh my God. It's so nice.
- Oh, thank you.

34:59.250 --> 35:03.125
Yeah. I brought you a book.
I think you'll dig her.

35:03.708 --> 35:05.499
Why are you so sweet?

35:05.500 --> 35:07.040
I'm just a really great person.

35:07.041 --> 35:08.374
Should I take my shoes off or...

35:08.375 --> 35:11.540
Uh, yeah, I mean only if you don't mind
stepping on food.

35:11.541 --> 35:14.291
Our place is so dirty,
it should just be condemned.

35:16.791 --> 35:19.374
Hey, he's got the knives again, Steve!

35:19.375 --> 35:20.291
I'm on it!

35:24.333 --> 35:25.375
Sorry.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.750
Connor!

35:29.625 --> 35:31.708
Connor, come here, buddy!

35:34.333 --> 35:36.040
Connor!

35:36.041 --> 35:37.874
- Oh, you!
- Hi!

35:37.875 --> 35:38.832
He went that way.

35:38.833 --> 35:39.875
- Okay.
- Yeah.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.290
I've had such a day.

35:45.291 --> 35:48.290
And this gives me such bad heartburn,
but I don't even care.

35:48.291 --> 35:50.083
- Thank you.
- Of course.

35:50.958 --> 35:55.875
To treating pregnant women like people
and believing in science.

35:56.666 --> 35:57.665
Hear, hear!

35:57.666 --> 35:59.582
- Cheers.
- Cheers, thank you.

35:59.583 --> 36:02.374
Daddy saves the day. No harm done.

36:02.375 --> 36:03.291
Amazing.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.915
Oh, and I hope you don't mind,
but I invited my brother to dinner.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.499
He just moved into our garage.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.290
You make him sound like a loser.

36:10.291 --> 36:11.915
Well, just temporarily.

36:11.916 --> 36:13.832
Broke up with this horse twat.

36:13.833 --> 36:17.166
Ever since then, he's just, like,
been walking around in sweats.

36:17.791 --> 36:18.999
Pathetic.

36:19.000 --> 36:19.915
Mmm.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.333
You don't drink, Steve?

36:21.958 --> 36:24.457
No. I am in the program.

36:24.458 --> 36:27.082
Yeah, child of an alcoholic right here...

36:27.083 --> 36:28.832
- ...so I get it.
- Oh, no, no.

36:28.833 --> 36:33.165
I'm just a pretty big follower
of Jada's <i>Red Table Talk.</i>

36:33.166 --> 36:34.124
Mmm.

36:34.125 --> 36:37.249
And she thinks
it's harmful for men to drink.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.999
- Great.
- Plus, I'm a really angry drunk.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.999
Like, terrible.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.374
- Steve.
- I don't remember, but it happens.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.333
I do.

36:45.541 --> 36:48.582
Oh. Speak of the queen.
New episode, just dropped.

36:48.583 --> 36:51.041
- Perfect timing.
- See y'all later.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.332
The deadbeat crashing
in your garage is here.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.250
Hi.

36:56.958 --> 36:58.457
Oh, my God, Latte.

36:58.458 --> 36:59.457
What?

36:59.458 --> 37:00.416
Lainy.

37:01.416 --> 37:02.665
Wow.

37:02.666 --> 37:04.207
You guys know each other?

37:04.208 --> 37:07.165
- Yeah, we do. We met a few weeks ago...
- Yeah.

37:07.166 --> 37:08.958
But you didn't seem like you were...

37:10.750 --> 37:11.999
Rockin' a baby?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.250
Yeah, exactly.

37:13.875 --> 37:17.332
Old Navy clothes.
You can hide anything in there, right?

37:17.333 --> 37:18.832
Wow.

37:18.833 --> 37:21.832
- This is nuts.
- Where did you two meet?

37:21.833 --> 37:24.749
A coffee shop.
I feel like I was just buying coffee,

37:24.750 --> 37:27.999
and then he just came up to me
and started talking my ear off.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.249
And usually I wouldn't talk to a stranger,

37:30.250 --> 37:32.332
but it seemed like
he really needed someone.

37:32.333 --> 37:35.540
Yeah, and Lainy got
some kind of pudding milkshake?

37:35.541 --> 37:37.915
Huh. Was it a pudding milk... It was...

37:37.916 --> 37:41.249
I remember there being
a lot more nutrition in it than that, but...

37:41.250 --> 37:43.624
- Should've gotten a double. Yeah.
- I did.

37:43.625 --> 37:45.583
- Oh, you did? Okay.
- I actually did.

37:47.041 --> 37:49.583
So, is your husband here?

37:50.166 --> 37:52.332
I don't have a husband.

37:52.333 --> 37:54.415
Wow. Josh. That's very subtle.

37:54.416 --> 37:56.332
What? I can, you know, ask anything.

37:56.333 --> 37:58.665
It's not like I'm saying,
"Hey, are you single?"

37:58.666 --> 38:00.040
I mean, you're single, though?

38:00.041 --> 38:00.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.082
This is just from, like,
a one-night thing, so...

38:04.083 --> 38:06.165
- Okay. I mean, great.
- Yeah.

38:06.166 --> 38:07.333
On Thanksgiving.

38:07.916 --> 38:08.749
Really?

38:08.750 --> 38:09.832
Wow.

38:09.833 --> 38:12.415
- Yeah.
- People usually stay home on Thanksgiving.

38:12.416 --> 38:13.332
What a rebel.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.790
Yeah. Not me. I get right out there.

38:15.791 --> 38:20.625
I get those sweet Black Friday-eve deals.

38:21.458 --> 38:23.915
You got pregnant at a Black Friday sale?

38:23.916 --> 38:29.500
Yep. Nothing gets me riled up
like a coupon for a Vitamix.

38:31.291 --> 38:32.499
Yeah.

38:32.500 --> 38:36.582
- Anybody want tea? I could go for some.
- Sure.

38:36.583 --> 38:39.207
- Can we make tea?
- No, please. Yeah. Here, I got some.

38:39.208 --> 38:41.375
- I'll have some black tea.
- Oh.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.040
Black tea. Cool guy.

38:44.041 --> 38:46.749
That's me. You know,
throw some honey in my shit.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.790
Did I tell you I'm a tea-cher?

38:48.791 --> 38:50.375
You did not tell me that.

38:50.958 --> 38:51.790
What do you do?

38:51.791 --> 38:55.874
I am the Chief Zamboni Officer
at Wollman Rink.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.082
- Wow. Cool.
- Fire.

38:58.083 --> 39:00.457
Yeah, fire. Or whatever my students say.

39:00.458 --> 39:03.625
- No, no, no. You're on fire!
- Oh my God! I'm on fire!

39:04.291 --> 39:05.500
- Where's my phone?
- Lainy!

39:06.291 --> 39:07.666
Oh, my God! The baby!

39:08.375 --> 39:09.749
She knows about the baby!

39:09.750 --> 39:12.207
- Fuck this.
- No! Steve!

39:12.208 --> 39:14.707
Ten years! Are you kidding me?

39:14.708 --> 39:16.916
Goddammit!

39:21.291 --> 39:23.332
<i>♪ Don't everybody like
The taste of apple pie? ♪</i>

39:23.333 --> 39:26.166
<i>♪ We'll snap for yo' slice of life
I'm tellin' ya why... ♪</i>

39:27.375 --> 39:30.291
Lainy, are you okay in there?
Can I help?

39:30.916 --> 39:31.916
Um...

39:32.666 --> 39:34.415
No, no, no. I'm all good.

39:34.416 --> 39:37.374
It's just a tiny burn.
It's very little. Don't worry about me.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.665
I'm a teacher.

39:38.666 --> 39:41.500
We deal
with this sort of thing all the time.

39:42.083 --> 39:44.290
Kids light themselves on fire?

39:44.291 --> 39:47.874
I'm fine. Okay?
Don't even think about it.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.707
Okay, I'm coming in,
but no touching without permission.

39:50.708 --> 39:52.499
- I promise.
- No, no, no. Hold on.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.374
Give me just one second.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.375
- You watch him.
- Yeah.

40:00.708 --> 40:02.041
Borrowed your robe.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.166
You borrowed Steve's robe.

40:09.791 --> 40:13.665
I'm okay, by the way.
Like, I'm cool to go back out.

40:13.666 --> 40:14.582
No, no, please.

40:14.583 --> 40:17.082
Can we just stay here
for like five more minutes?

40:17.083 --> 40:18.000
Yeah.

40:18.625 --> 40:19.750
Yeah.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.041
It's just all so isolating.

40:26.416 --> 40:27.665
Yeah.

40:27.666 --> 40:29.416
And you haven't even had one yet.

40:30.208 --> 40:31.208
Right.

40:32.666 --> 40:33.916
They don't tell you.

40:35.333 --> 40:38.000
Women don't share what it's like,
what really happens.

40:39.041 --> 40:41.207
- With pregnancy?
- With birth.

40:41.208 --> 40:43.416
Think about it.
How many birth stories do you know?

40:46.166 --> 40:47.707
- None.
- Exactly.

40:47.708 --> 40:50.457
I mean, some will talk about
how many hours they labored for,

40:50.458 --> 40:52.625
but that's it.

40:53.791 --> 40:54.749
Why is that?

40:54.750 --> 40:57.415
Because you go through
this whole thing, this whole trauma,

40:57.416 --> 40:59.832
and then just, bam,
right away, you're a mom.

40:59.833 --> 41:03.290
No time to process what's just happened
or what's about to happen.

41:03.291 --> 41:04.291
Right.

41:06.666 --> 41:08.625
Did you have trauma with Connor?

41:09.250 --> 41:12.040
It was actually after he came out.

41:12.041 --> 41:13.665
Everything went awry.

41:13.666 --> 41:15.833
I started bleeding out a lot, and...

41:16.791 --> 41:18.040
Um...

41:18.041 --> 41:21.790
He was on my chest,
so I was actually in heaven.

41:21.791 --> 41:23.000
I was so fine.

41:23.625 --> 41:27.040
But what was happening wasn't okay.
I was just losing a lot of blood.

41:27.041 --> 41:29.833
And it was the first time
I saw Steve scared.

41:30.625 --> 41:33.000
Did you think
you were going to, like, die?

41:34.291 --> 41:35.208
Maybe.

41:41.541 --> 41:42.833
God.

41:43.541 --> 41:44.958
Did I just scare you?

41:47.041 --> 41:48.207
No.

41:48.208 --> 41:49.583
Can't wait.

41:52.791 --> 41:55.708
Did your mom talk to you about your birth?

41:57.916 --> 42:00.457
My mom died when I was like six, so...

42:00.458 --> 42:01.915
I'm sorry, Lainy.

42:01.916 --> 42:03.208
It's okay.

42:03.875 --> 42:06.541
God, it's so nice to talk
to someone real.

42:10.791 --> 42:13.458
Meg, I have to tell you something.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.457
I get it. We want to be pregnant so badly,

42:17.458 --> 42:19.790
and then we finally are,
and it's out of our control.

42:19.791 --> 42:20.832
It's scary.

42:20.833 --> 42:23.958
My postpartum was so bad with Connor,
I didn't think I'd make it.

42:25.333 --> 42:27.957
It's not that. I, um--

42:27.958 --> 42:31.875
But to see you doing it,
and how brave you are...

42:33.250 --> 42:34.583
you give me strength.

42:36.833 --> 42:40.332
Can you smell that?
It's like burnt plastic or something.

42:40.333 --> 42:41.541
No.

42:42.416 --> 42:44.624
So I gave him my number. Maybe he calls.

42:44.625 --> 42:48.000
I have no idea
what I'm even hoping for at this point.

42:50.250 --> 42:51.249
You know what I'm hoping?

42:51.250 --> 42:53.582
I'm hoping that you get
the psychological help

42:53.583 --> 42:55.207
that you so desperately need.

42:55.208 --> 42:57.957
Because you need help.
You need not a little help.

42:57.958 --> 43:00.082
You need a paramedic.

43:00.083 --> 43:02.915
You need an ICU nurse. You need a doctor.

43:02.916 --> 43:04.249
You need a psychologist.

43:04.250 --> 43:06.999
You need a dentist
and a proctologist to work together

43:07.000 --> 43:08.749
and meet each other in the middle

43:08.750 --> 43:11.624
near your foam belly
and sort all of that shit out

43:11.625 --> 43:13.540
and, boom, pull it out!

43:13.541 --> 43:17.040
How dare you walk around
with that fake fucking belly!

43:17.041 --> 43:18.790
Can you keep it down?

43:18.791 --> 43:21.457
I could. But I won't.

43:21.458 --> 43:24.040
You don't just wake up one morning

43:24.041 --> 43:27.499
and strap it on and now all of a sudden
you're all fabulous and pregnant.

43:27.500 --> 43:28.874
That's not how it works.

43:28.875 --> 43:32.375
Honestly, what's going to happen
if someone you know catches you with this?

43:33.708 --> 43:36.040
What am I going to do?

43:36.041 --> 43:37.790
You'll have a little miscarriage.

43:37.791 --> 43:40.457
Oh my God. Little Susan.

43:40.458 --> 43:44.124
You had all of the names in the world

43:44.125 --> 43:46.499
and that's what you landed on
for your fake baby?

43:46.500 --> 43:47.874
Why am I listening to you?

43:47.875 --> 43:50.582
You have three
active restraining orders against you.

43:50.583 --> 43:54.040
Which says to me
there are three people out there

43:54.041 --> 43:58.415
who sees my passion,
who knows that I'm a go-getter.

43:58.416 --> 43:59.499
Not you.

43:59.500 --> 44:02.290
"I gave my number to someone,
I hope they call."

44:02.291 --> 44:03.415
Do I do that?

44:03.416 --> 44:05.457
Fuck no! I show up at their work.

44:05.458 --> 44:08.207
I show up at their house.
I show up at their mother's house.

44:08.208 --> 44:10.624
I'm fucking everywhere. And that is why--

44:10.625 --> 44:13.665
Okay, well thank you so much
for this very helpful feedback.

44:13.666 --> 44:14.916
You're welcome.

44:16.250 --> 44:17.833
Logan, get in here.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.791
Results are back.

44:23.041 --> 44:24.332
As predicted,

44:24.333 --> 44:25.582
you're stupid.

44:25.583 --> 44:27.749
Thanks for shopping with me.

44:27.750 --> 44:29.999
Mark does not give one shit
about this baby.

44:30.000 --> 44:30.999
He does.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.082
No, I don't even think
he knows the due date.

44:33.083 --> 44:34.749
I'm sure he knows the due date.

44:34.750 --> 44:36.333
Mark, what's the due date?

44:36.958 --> 44:38.165
I'm not hungry, babe.

44:38.166 --> 44:39.582
- Exactly.
- He's probably--

44:39.583 --> 44:41.875
Exactly.
Let's check out the baby monitors.

44:42.666 --> 44:44.665
Why is all this shit in black and white?

44:44.666 --> 44:47.665
I don't want the nursery
to look like Tim Burton decorated it.

44:47.666 --> 44:50.915
Well, babies can only see black and white
in the first couple months.

44:50.916 --> 44:52.207
- Really?
- You didn't know that?

44:52.208 --> 44:53.290
Where did you hear that?

44:53.291 --> 44:54.874
Precious Little Strangers.

44:54.875 --> 44:57.124
Precious Little... What is that? What?

44:57.125 --> 44:58.665
It's an Instagram account.

44:58.666 --> 45:01.040
You should be following it.
I'm surprised you're not.

45:01.041 --> 45:02.875
Like every pregnant woman follows it.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.790
Okay, not every pregnant woman.

45:05.791 --> 45:08.707
Are you okay?
You, like, don't seem excited.

45:08.708 --> 45:11.790
Well, why are you reading
all this pregnancy stuff anyway?

45:11.791 --> 45:14.833
Because I'm... I want you to see how...

45:15.458 --> 45:17.583
Like, so I know what you're going through.

45:19.125 --> 45:21.290
- Well, that's nice.
- Yeah.

45:21.291 --> 45:22.540
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

45:22.541 --> 45:24.249
It's probably just my hormones.

45:24.250 --> 45:25.290
Hi.

45:25.291 --> 45:26.915
No baby?

45:26.916 --> 45:30.332
Way to pour salt on the wound, kid.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

45:30.333 --> 45:31.582
Why no baby?

45:31.583 --> 45:35.124
Not everyone has a baby.
Okay, kid, move along, please.

45:35.125 --> 45:37.374
Me hurt baby?

45:37.375 --> 45:39.790
What a little psycho.

45:39.791 --> 45:41.415
- Yeah, okay. Let's go.
- Connor!

45:41.416 --> 45:42.707
No, that sounds like his mom.

45:42.708 --> 45:44.874
- We should--
- No. He needs to find his own way.

45:44.875 --> 45:48.000
- It's the only chance he'll learn.
- Stop! We've got to find his parents.

45:50.125 --> 45:52.332
- Are you hiding?
- I'm relaxing.

45:52.333 --> 45:54.125
What are you hiding from?

45:55.250 --> 45:57.458
Where did you go?
Connor, come back here!

45:59.166 --> 46:01.458
Connor? Come back here, please!

46:04.625 --> 46:05.708
Balls.

46:06.583 --> 46:07.916
Connor!

46:13.291 --> 46:14.832
Oh, there you are.

46:14.833 --> 46:18.750
Don't run away like that again, okay?
Ever, ever, ever. Come here.

46:20.041 --> 46:20.875
Lainy!

46:27.833 --> 46:29.165
Hey.

46:29.166 --> 46:30.957
Steve, what the hell?

46:30.958 --> 46:34.332
It's called an empathy bump, all right?

46:34.333 --> 46:36.416
So that I can feel your pain.

46:37.125 --> 46:40.207
And, babe, I've got to say,
really not that bad.

46:40.208 --> 46:42.166
- Get the Mazda.
- Yeah.

46:43.583 --> 46:44.791
Let's go.

46:45.916 --> 46:46.832
Where's Lainy?

46:46.833 --> 46:49.333
I don't know. She just disappeared.

46:49.916 --> 46:51.915
I'm really worried about her, you know?

46:51.916 --> 46:54.332
No. You need to worry
about yourself, okay?

46:54.333 --> 46:56.625
Lainy is a self-sabotager.

46:57.250 --> 46:58.332
Ugh.

46:58.333 --> 47:00.541
I can tell you just learned that phrase.

47:01.375 --> 47:04.416
No... What gave it away?

47:15.125 --> 47:17.249
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Lainy, it's Josh.</i>

47:17.250 --> 47:19.582
I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.

47:19.583 --> 47:26.208
No, no. I was just, um,
reading to, uh, sick animals.

47:26.875 --> 47:28.874
Oh. That's nice.

47:28.875 --> 47:32.000
Look, I just wanted to see if you
wanted to come by the rink this week.

47:33.875 --> 47:36.082
Oh, gosh, let me check my schedule.

47:36.083 --> 47:39.582
I'm so busy. Oh!
Looks like I'm free. I'll be there.

47:39.583 --> 47:41.832
Okay, well, how about tomorrow?

47:41.833 --> 47:42.999
That'd be great.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.790
Okay, awesome.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

47:45.791 --> 47:47.125
See you there.

47:49.875 --> 47:52.083
Things are looking up.

48:05.583 --> 48:08.999
God, this feels so good.
I haven't done this since I was a teen.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.291
It never gets old.

48:10.875 --> 48:12.750
It's the best job in the world.

48:15.791 --> 48:18.582

48:18.583 --> 48:20.499

I know it's corny, but, like,

48:23.666 --> 48:26.290
they changed my life. And poetry.

48:26.291 --> 48:28.916
- Who's your favorite?
- Anne Sexton.

48:31.375 --> 48:32.624
<i>Ever hear of her?</i>

48:32.625 --> 48:35.249
Who hasn't heard of Anne Sexton? You know?

48:35.250 --> 48:36.207
You?

48:36.208 --> 48:38.749
Yes, me is one of those people.

48:38.750 --> 48:41.166
Am I better on the ice
than you thought I was gonna be?

48:42.166 --> 48:43.083
Fuck!

48:44.333 --> 48:45.624
- You okay?
- Yeah.

48:45.625 --> 48:47.083
- What if you just kinda like...
- Oh!

48:48.500 --> 48:51.415
All right, team...

How'd you know you were ready to be a mom?

49:22.916 --> 49:24.000
Oh...

49:25.208 --> 49:26.208
I mean...

49:26.958 --> 49:28.166
Everyone wants that.

49:28.916 --> 49:29.916
You wanna...

49:31.333 --> 49:32.750
get married and have a baby.

49:33.375 --> 49:34.708
Why shouldn't I want that?

49:35.291 --> 49:36.374
No, I mean, I know...

49:36.375 --> 49:39.290
I knew I wanted kids
at a weirdly young age.

49:39.291 --> 49:40.791
That's amazing. I...

49:42.375 --> 49:44.624
You're so lucky you have your sister.

49:44.625 --> 49:46.915
- I don't have siblings.
- Yeah.

49:46.916 --> 49:49.957
I, you know, I don't have family,
so I don't wanna be alone.

49:49.958 --> 49:52.791
I've always known I want a family.

49:54.208 --> 49:57.333
I'm just getting a little worried that
that's not in the cards for me.

49:58.500 --> 49:59.333
What?

50:00.458 --> 50:03.290
I mean, not the baby.
Like, I'm having a baby.

50:03.291 --> 50:06.582
Yeah, no, you know,
the partner stuff. Yeah.

50:06.583 --> 50:09.166
It'll happen. You know what they say.

50:09.958 --> 50:11.708
Kiss a lot of turds, right?

50:13.125 --> 50:14.041
No.

50:14.541 --> 50:16.875
No one says that. It's toads.

50:17.375 --> 50:19.415
Like "The early turd gets the worm."

50:19.416 --> 50:22.291
No, it's bird.
"Early bird gets the worm."

50:24.583 --> 50:25.749
It is bird.

50:25.750 --> 50:28.458
But it is "kiss a lot of turds" for sure.

50:31.041 --> 50:31.958
Oh, man.

50:32.791 --> 50:35.499
See that guy
messing up the ice with his skates?

50:35.500 --> 50:36.916
He's doing it on purpose.

50:37.541 --> 50:40.915
Hey! Stop fucking up the ice,
you piece of shit!

50:40.916 --> 50:43.125
We could have you killed in minutes!

50:46.166 --> 50:48.499
Do you guys have
any hot chocolate around here?

50:48.500 --> 50:49.416
Yeah.

50:50.791 --> 50:52.457
You gotta be shitting me.

50:52.458 --> 50:55.166
We should Photoshop
some dicks into their mouths.

50:58.458 --> 51:01.790
I was coming over to ask
if you thought it was over the top.

51:01.791 --> 51:03.332
I guess I have my answer.

51:03.333 --> 51:06.541
No, I mean, I love it. I love it.
I think it's quite provocative.

51:07.541 --> 51:09.624
I'll give you boys some privacy.

51:09.625 --> 51:13.832
Um, I'm sorry. I was, like, just trying
to make crazy-ass Fallon laugh.

51:13.833 --> 51:14.832
Yeah.

51:14.833 --> 51:18.499
We were just being funny.
It's not like we're taking that seriously.

51:18.500 --> 51:19.790
- Yeah, it's ironic.
- Yeah.

51:19.791 --> 51:22.500
It's, yeah, so, yeah. Sorry.

51:23.250 --> 51:25.457
I have to talk to you about something, so...

51:25.458 --> 51:28.457
Okay. Is it that you're in love with me?

51:28.458 --> 51:29.707
Because I already knew.

51:29.708 --> 51:32.915
No, no, no. No, I just...

51:32.916 --> 51:34.124
You're scaring me.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.916
You can't be in the delivery room.

51:37.416 --> 51:40.915
What do you mean?
Why wouldn't I be able to be in there?

51:40.916 --> 51:43.082
If you say Shirley's
going to be in there with you...

51:43.083 --> 51:44.665
- ...I'm going to murder someone.
- No.

51:44.666 --> 51:46.749
She is not going to be in the room, okay?

51:46.750 --> 51:49.290
But she did surprise me
and she got a doula,

51:49.291 --> 51:51.915
and there can only be two people
in the room, so...

51:51.916 --> 51:56.833
So you're choosing Mark
and some placenta-sniffing midwife

51:57.458 --> 52:00.165
over your best friend
who you've known your whole life?

52:00.166 --> 52:02.290
You know what?
Can we just be honest for once?

52:02.291 --> 52:03.832
Okay, I'm ready to be honest.

52:03.833 --> 52:05.790
- That sounds nice.
- Great. Let's do it.

52:05.791 --> 52:07.374
You're pissed because I'm pregnant.

52:07.375 --> 52:11.165
No, I'm not. That's so insane
that you would think that.

52:11.166 --> 52:12.582
I'm so happy for you.

52:12.583 --> 52:15.374
I've been going everywhere with you,

52:15.375 --> 52:18.540
showing you how happy I am
about this pregnancy.

52:18.541 --> 52:20.665
Yeah, you seem real happy, Lainy.

52:20.666 --> 52:21.999
Look, I'm just mad

52:22.000 --> 52:26.207
because you're being
a stupid, tit-faced jerk butt.

52:26.208 --> 52:29.415
Oh, it is you, my friend,
that has the face of a tit.

52:29.416 --> 52:31.332
- Really? Me?
- That's what you are.

52:31.333 --> 52:33.415
All right.
Can you two bitches calm down?

52:33.416 --> 52:36.207
You can't even come up with
proper fucking swear words.

52:36.208 --> 52:38.082
I love you both equally, all right?

52:38.083 --> 52:39.457
Okay. Forget this.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.040
Oh, fuck her.

52:41.041 --> 52:44.207
Ms. Newton, I found this on the bleachers.

52:44.208 --> 52:46.250
Oh! Um...

52:46.875 --> 52:48.165
Oh.

52:48.166 --> 52:50.874
You did the right thing to bring it to me.
Thank you.

52:50.875 --> 52:53.458
You don't have to tell anyone about this.
I'll handle it.

52:54.333 --> 52:55.625
Score.

53:00.666 --> 53:03.457
So, wait, you were saying, okay,
so then you dated...

53:03.458 --> 53:06.750
I dated an ice cream scooper
at Casey's Scoops.

53:07.541 --> 53:10.624
But then I realized I was just, like,
in it for the ice cream...

53:10.625 --> 53:12.665
...and that's just not enough.

53:12.666 --> 53:14.874
- No.
- You gotta have chemistry, too, right?

53:14.875 --> 53:17.665
You can also just have ice cream
and not date the scooper.

53:17.666 --> 53:19.582
I figured that out.
I figured it out too late.

53:19.583 --> 53:21.124
Ever dated a pregnant woman?

53:21.125 --> 53:23.540
You're the least pregnant person
I've ever dated.

53:23.541 --> 53:25.124
Wow. You wait till they're crowning.

53:25.125 --> 53:27.916
I want them to be, like,
two weeks away from dropping.

53:28.875 --> 53:30.666
So are we dating?

53:31.708 --> 53:35.832
No. I don't know.
I mean, I'm seeing a lot of other people.

53:35.833 --> 53:36.874
- Okay.
- Yeah.

53:36.875 --> 53:39.915
- I'm sorry you're in the friend zone.
- The friend zone.

53:39.916 --> 53:42.874
I thought you were gay until, like,
five minutes ago.

53:42.875 --> 53:45.833
We can always just
joke around if you want.

53:47.375 --> 53:49.040
I don't always joke around.

53:49.041 --> 53:52.041
Okay, no, I'm... you know.

<i>My nerves are turned on</i>

54:31.708 --> 54:33.000
"The Kiss."

54:44.708 --> 54:45.707
Oh, sorry.

54:45.708 --> 54:47.207
- No, I'm sorry.
- No.

54:47.208 --> 54:48.624
- I'm fine. It's fine.
- It's okay.

54:48.625 --> 54:51.582
No, I'm just a little self-conscious
about my body right now...

54:51.583 --> 54:52.915
Oh, yeah.

56:14.041 --> 56:17.750

I didn't know you liked, um...

56:30.500 --> 56:33.333

- I thought you were on birth control!

56:33.958 --> 56:35.708
How could you do this to me?

56:37.041 --> 56:40.332
You're such an asshole.
And don't worry because it's not yours.

56:40.333 --> 56:42.749
Wait, so... When did you even--

56:42.750 --> 56:44.000
Thanksgiving.

56:44.541 --> 56:47.040
- We were at my parents' house in Vermont.
- Mm-hmm.

56:47.041 --> 56:50.540
- We were together the whole time.
- No, obviously not.

56:50.541 --> 56:52.083
Not when you were, uh...

56:54.375 --> 56:56.291
- Asleep?
- Bingo.

56:56.875 --> 57:01.290
When you were asleep,
I went to Black Friday sales.

57:01.291 --> 57:04.749
And... fucked somebody at a Brookstone?

57:04.750 --> 57:05.875
Costco.

57:06.458 --> 57:08.165
Because they have the best deals

57:08.166 --> 57:10.333
and the best dick.

57:11.750 --> 57:13.540
And I don't even know
what you're looking at.

57:13.541 --> 57:14.624
What do you even do?

57:14.625 --> 57:16.165
I'm a scientist.

57:16.166 --> 57:18.500
That's not a real job.
What do all of you do?

57:19.083 --> 57:20.875
We're all scientists.

57:22.208 --> 57:24.999
I've moved on.
And I suggest you do the same.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.416
Excuse me.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.208
Someone actually beautiful
is coming through. Me.

57:39.125 --> 57:40.375
Surprise!

57:41.041 --> 57:42.665
- Meg!
- Lainy.

57:42.666 --> 57:43.915
Hey!

57:43.916 --> 57:45.582
Oh my God, Lainy.

57:45.583 --> 57:47.000
Your room is so cute.

57:47.583 --> 57:49.083
It's so sweet.

57:50.083 --> 57:52.499
Thank you! That is so nice.

57:52.500 --> 57:53.791
Oh, I love it.

57:54.750 --> 57:59.082
What are you doing here
in my... belly of the woods?

57:59.083 --> 58:02.124
A prenatal depression workshop's nearby
that's supposed to be amazing.

58:02.125 --> 58:03.666
So I thought I'd come surprise you.

58:04.250 --> 58:06.332
Oh, cool. I don't have that.

58:06.333 --> 58:07.291
Oh.

58:07.916 --> 58:09.540
Okay, well, I do.

58:09.541 --> 58:11.833
You're gonna make me
face these chicks alone?

58:13.083 --> 58:14.083
No.

58:14.750 --> 58:16.750
I wouldn't do that to a friend. I'm in.

58:19.208 --> 58:22.332
- It's supposed to be very therapeutic.
- Okay, great.

58:22.333 --> 58:24.165
- We'll just give it a go.
- Let's do it.

58:24.166 --> 58:26.374
- My God, you really popped this week.
- Didn't I?

58:26.375 --> 58:28.250
Yeah. It just kind of hits.

58:33.958 --> 58:36.874
I didn't know so many women
got depressed during pregnancy.

58:36.875 --> 58:40.583
Yeah. Because we're so ashamed
for not just bubbling over with gratitude.

58:41.166 --> 58:43.957
Excuse me,
legitimate pregnant lady coming through.

58:43.958 --> 58:44.958
Six weeks.

58:45.833 --> 58:47.957
Nice boobs. I can say that. I've got them.

58:47.958 --> 58:51.250
I've got them too.
It's not offensive if you have them.

58:52.833 --> 58:54.249
What the hell are you doing here?

58:54.250 --> 58:57.040
Oh, I see.
Good enough for thee, but not for me.

58:57.041 --> 58:58.540
You're a pregnancy tourist.

58:58.541 --> 59:00.749
- You shouldn't be here.
- You shouldn't be here.

59:00.750 --> 59:02.249
- You shouldn't.
- You shouldn't.

59:02.250 --> 59:03.458
Get...

59:04.000 --> 59:05.707
Don't punch my baby!

59:05.708 --> 59:06.916
Hello, ladies.

59:07.500 --> 59:08.749
How are you guys doing?

59:08.750 --> 59:10.374
Good.

59:10.375 --> 59:11.458
Bullshit!

59:12.583 --> 59:14.749
You don't have to lie in here, sisters.

59:14.750 --> 59:16.499
This is a place of truth.

59:16.500 --> 59:19.583
How do you really feel
during your pregnancies?

59:20.708 --> 59:21.708
Tell me.

59:22.458 --> 59:23.500
Come on.

59:24.333 --> 59:25.415
I'm angry.

59:25.416 --> 59:27.750
I ate a cupcake
out of the trash can last night.

59:28.416 --> 59:30.665
My nipples are so dry!

59:30.666 --> 59:31.875
Yes!

59:33.083 --> 59:33.957
Thank you.

59:33.958 --> 59:34.915
I know.

59:34.916 --> 59:36.458
I've got a hairy butthole.

59:37.250 --> 59:38.457
What the hell are you doing?

59:38.458 --> 59:40.416
- I've got a hairy butthole.
- Shut up.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.290
All right, ladies.
We are going to take a quick pee break,

59:50.291 --> 59:52.499
which we'll be doing every three minutes.

59:52.500 --> 59:55.290
And if you're the one woman
who can still shit while she's pregnant,

59:55.291 --> 59:56.875
good for you. Now is your chance.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.915
- Thank you so much. This is great.
- Of course.

59:59.916 --> 01:00:02.250
Get it out. She's amazing.

01:00:02.791 --> 01:00:04.707
Oh, shit. My sitter just bailed.

01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:07.000
Oh, sorry. That sucks.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.166
Would you mind
watching Connor tomorrow night?

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:12.499
I don't know.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.332
Please. It's Steve's birthday.

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:17.750
Josh has a hockey game he has to work,
and I don't have anybody else to ask.

01:00:18.666 --> 01:00:20.250
It's kind of nice to be needed.

01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:22.374
Yeah, of course.

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:23.958
We love having you over.

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:25.916
Josh especially.

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:29.457
- Really?
- Oh, cool. She's also bailing tonight.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:30.541
Okay, I got to go.

Oh, hey. Uh, guess who we're going to see?

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:09.665
Wow.

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:15.707

get married, start a family.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.583
Did you ever tell such a big lie
you don't know how to get out of it?

01:01:45.541 --> 01:01:47.457
I ate the whole cookie.

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:50.124
- Peek-a-boo.
- Oh my God! Oh my God.

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:52.624
- You scared me.
- I was over here.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:54.666
Let me tell you a real story.

01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:59.125
There was once a family...

01:02:00.875 --> 01:02:03.458
of beautiful, beautiful princesses...

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:06.875
called the Kardashians.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:11.332
And they lived in a palace

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:15.166
that their dad bought them
by defending a murderer.

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:16.999
Hey, hey.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.374
Uncle Joshy.

01:02:18.375 --> 01:02:21.665
Yeah, yeah,
don't get all riled up, Con-man.

01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:22.749
Yeah, sorry.

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.957
I thought
I'd do a little better with that.

01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:26.000
You're very cute.

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:29.208
Let's read the book we like, all right?

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.625

01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:38.708
"This is a book with no pictures."

01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:41.457
"It might seem like no fun

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:44.000
to have someone
read you a book with no pictures."

01:02:44.833 --> 01:02:48.165
"Probably seems boring and serious."

01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:51.415
"Except, here's how books work."

01:02:51.416 --> 01:02:55.708
"Everything the words say,
the person reading the book has to say."

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.040

The garage. Right down... downstairs.

01:04:00.958 --> 01:04:02.165
It's roomy.

01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:04.624
Well, the car's not here.
It's usually right there.

01:04:04.625 --> 01:04:07.166
Okay, I want to have sex with you.

01:04:07.833 --> 01:04:09.207
Fantastic.

01:04:09.208 --> 01:04:12.790
But I'm very self-conscious
of my body right now, as I've said.

01:04:12.791 --> 01:04:14.207
Sure, yes.

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:15.915
So, there's going to be a couple rules.

01:04:15.916 --> 01:04:18.082
Okay, great. I'm down with rules.

01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:21.415
You know, <i>Cider House, Vanderpump,</i>
all the rules.

01:04:21.416 --> 01:04:23.790
Okay, well, just two rules.

01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:25.708
No touching me and no looking at me.

01:04:26.458 --> 01:04:28.332
Oh, okay. I mean, you know,

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:31.290

but if that doth what m'lady require of--

- Yes. Yes. It's cool.

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:38.833
Great.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:58.790
Wait. Can't do what?

01:08:58.791 --> 01:08:59.874
You have Connor?

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:02.041
Yeah. Wait, what did I say?

01:09:02.916 --> 01:09:04.458
Why are you leaving?

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:13.624
Everyone just stick together.

01:09:13.625 --> 01:09:16.082
No touching the butterflies.

01:09:16.083 --> 01:09:18.582
Do not disrupt their metamorphosis.

01:09:18.583 --> 01:09:19.874
I'm totally fucked.

01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:22.124
Are you? 'Cause the way I understand it

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:24.457
is Josh is the one
that got bit of a fucking.

01:09:24.458 --> 01:09:27.415
Stop it! Come on!

01:09:27.416 --> 01:09:30.416
Sorry. Butterflies make me anxious.

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:34.415
I almost told him.
I almost and then I...

01:09:34.416 --> 01:09:36.499
No touching.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.207
I don't know what relationship
could possibly survive

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.165
this level of dishonesty.

01:09:41.166 --> 01:09:43.999
I've lied so much.
I don't know what to do.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.708
He's going to find out the truth
about my pregnancy at some point, right?

01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:50.291
I mean, he's not going to
forget about a baby.

01:09:51.333 --> 01:09:54.291
God. I can't believe
I fell for Meg's brother.

01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:58.666
It's ridiculous. Like, I really like him.

01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:01.833
You're going to have to get that baby out.

01:10:02.916 --> 01:10:04.666
I need to get rid of my baby.

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:06.500
Oh, shit.

01:10:07.416 --> 01:10:09.416
Why are they only landing on you?

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:12.749
- Are they on me?
- Yeah.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:15.832
Are they on me right now? Right now?

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:17.832
- Yeah.
- Get bug spray.

01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:20.207
Get some bug spray. Get them off me.

01:10:20.208 --> 01:10:22.666
- Get these evil demons off me!
- Stop it.

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:25.624
- Sorry. She's fine.
- No touching.

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:27.707
I didn't touch them!
They were touching me!

01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:30.624
Please don't raise your voice
in here, ma'am.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:31.832
I will fight you.

01:10:31.833 --> 01:10:33.832
I'll fuck you up.

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:37.207
I will bite your fucking aorta right out.

01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:39.040
Butterflies, attack!

01:10:39.041 --> 01:10:40.915
- I'm coming to get you.
- Come on.

01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:42.750
Piece of shit bitch.

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:51.374
Thanks for meeting me.

01:10:51.375 --> 01:10:52.500
Of course.

01:10:56.416 --> 01:10:57.416
How are you?

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.666
I'm good. I stopped puking, so...

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:03.041
That's great.

01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:07.040
How about you? Are you puking?

01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:08.000
No.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:12.207
- Why would I be puking?
- I don't know.

01:11:12.208 --> 01:11:15.583
Sometimes in the morning people get...

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:19.958
like, their tummy rumbles and... Nothing?

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:23.874
Are you okay?

01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:24.958
Yeah.

01:11:26.291 --> 01:11:28.833
I guess I'm just nervous
about the baby shower.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:33.666
It's gonna be great.
Thanks for including me.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.750
What does that mean?

01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:39.707
What? Thanks for including me.

01:11:39.708 --> 01:11:42.333
Why would you not be invited?
You're my best friend.

01:11:44.916 --> 01:11:46.541
It's okay. I...

01:11:47.416 --> 01:11:48.332
You and Shirley.

01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:49.915
It looks like it's gonna be amazing.

01:11:49.916 --> 01:11:52.165
It's gonna be better than
anything I could have done.

01:11:52.166 --> 01:11:54.332
I have to actually run.

01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:56.332
I have like a million papers to grade.

01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:57.915
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

01:11:57.916 --> 01:11:58.999
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.083
Okay. All right.

01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:25.124
I wanna see a paternity test,
am I right?

01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:28.125
No. I can't believe someone's
gonna be calling me "daddy" soon.

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.125
Wow.

01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:33.750
- Hey, look what I found.
- What?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.915
What the fuck is that?

01:12:36.916 --> 01:12:38.499
I've always wanted a cow.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.374
That's an alpaca.

01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:42.582
I've been milking her
for an hour and a half

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:44.415
because they only have
fake milk at the bar.

01:12:44.416 --> 01:12:48.332
I only got like a teaspoon
for this macchiato with little Bessie.

01:12:48.333 --> 01:12:49.500
What a giver.

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:53.457
- That's obviously a boy.
- What?

01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:55.500
You've been jerking off a boy alpaca.

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:59.583
That explains the sounds,
and it's quite salty too.

01:13:01.916 --> 01:13:02.791
Macchiato?

01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:04.333
I'm gonna pass.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.125
Garrett, can you take this cow to my car?

01:13:08.541 --> 01:13:09.874
Hi, Lainy.

01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:11.083
Hey, Connor.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:12.791
Connor?

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:15.708
Oh, shit.

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.208
- Fuck.
- Is that your man?

01:13:25.916 --> 01:13:28.457
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

01:13:28.458 --> 01:13:29.416
Fuck!

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:35.750
She's gotta be here somewhere.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:43.415
Hey! What are you
gorgeous humans doing here?

01:13:43.416 --> 01:13:45.249
Your friend Shirley invited us.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.707
Classic Shirley.

01:13:47.708 --> 01:13:49.666
Why haven't you returned my calls?

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:51.375
Calls? What?

01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:52.915
You okay?

01:13:52.916 --> 01:13:54.208
Never better.

01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:56.665
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:59.707
Are these your friends
you've never mentioned?

01:13:59.708 --> 01:14:01.540
Mm-hmm. Josh.

01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:02.707
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:02.708 --> 01:14:04.374
- And Megan.
- Hi.

01:14:04.375 --> 01:14:06.165
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:08.374
And then there's Steve and Connor.

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:10.416
Everyone!

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:16.332
May I have your... attention please.

01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:17.624
Thank you.

01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:19.124
Um...

01:14:19.125 --> 01:14:21.290
First off, Kate and I are so happy...

01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:23.207
...that you could make it
to our baby shower.

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:25.166
Round of applause!

01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:28.540
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:30.082
Um...

01:14:30.083 --> 01:14:32.915
Well, I didn't know that
it was gonna be this insane,

01:14:32.916 --> 01:14:36.332
but it does look kind of cool,
so thanks for making me do this.

01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:38.499
- Stop it.
- What? Oh.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.583
Like, I love you.

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:41.290
Give me a break.

01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:43.749
- Yeah.
- It's like so many emotions.

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.333
Sorry. [exhales] But...

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.916
I wanna talk about
someone else for a minute.

01:14:53.666 --> 01:14:58.500
Someone we all know and love
named Lainy! Whoo!

01:15:00.541 --> 01:15:04.540
No. This is your day.
Keep it focused on you, please.

01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:07.874
Lainy, everyone at school and on the web

01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:10.374
knows that I am
the sexiest teacher in the world

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:12.582
and that kindness is my favorite hobby.

01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:14.707
So I want this to be your day, too.

01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:17.499
I don't want it to be.
It's your day, so please leave me alone.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.165
- Really, please leave me alone.
- Okay. Come here.

01:15:20.166 --> 01:15:23.249
<i>Context, Lainy is pregnant
and thinking of terminating,</i>

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:26.249
which is so fine because you know
I'm pro-choice like a Rolls Royce.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.582
Oh my God.

01:15:27.583 --> 01:15:29.624
But this could be
our unicorn's last chance!

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.540
Wait, no, you need to
go into the wrinkles.

01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:33.499
So we're hoping that we can talk her...

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.916
- ...into keeping it, right?
- Stop.

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:38.040
- Yes!
- My God, the chat is on fire.

01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:39.999
- Enough.
- Wait, no, that's my phone.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.290
No, I'm turning it off.
You're acting like a crazy--

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:43.332
Stop it!

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:45.750
- Oh my God!
- Enough!

01:15:46.958 --> 01:15:48.874
I'm not having an abortion!

01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:50.707
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

01:15:50.708 --> 01:15:52.333
Jesus, Shirley, I would.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:53.957
Kate has.

01:15:53.958 --> 01:15:55.249
My mom tried.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.874
Wait, so you are having the baby! Whoo!

01:15:57.875 --> 01:16:00.374
Keep it!
Keep it! Keep it! Keep it!

01:16:00.375 --> 01:16:02.165
Stop it! Stop it!

01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:06.333
I'm not! I'm not having the baby!
I'm not... I'm not pregnant!

01:16:11.041 --> 01:16:12.208
I've been lying.

01:16:15.375 --> 01:16:16.625
I'm faking it.

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:24.625
Meg.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.500
Steve, get the fucking Mazda.

01:16:34.166 --> 01:16:36.458
Josh, let me explain.

01:16:37.916 --> 01:16:39.583
You need serious help.

01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:50.458
I'm sorry.

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:16.832
I know you'll never love me again.

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:18.833
I just hope someday you don't hate me.

01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:23.041
I don't hate you.

01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:26.290
You don't?

01:17:26.291 --> 01:17:28.500
No. I love you.

01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:31.166
I knew that something was up.

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:33.958
I just didn't know what it was.

01:17:35.166 --> 01:17:36.875
I'm not even mad at you.

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.625
I mean, I'm really mad at Mark.

01:17:40.666 --> 01:17:43.333
For not being happy
about this baby at all.

01:17:45.083 --> 01:17:48.000
It's been really hard
doing this without you.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:50.875
Fuck.

01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:53.666
I was jealous.

01:17:54.708 --> 01:17:58.333
Of you... I was really jealous of Mark.

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:01.375
That's funny.

01:18:02.041 --> 01:18:03.040
For real.

01:18:03.041 --> 01:18:06.250
I've always been jealous of Mark.
He gets to spend so much time with you.

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:08.915
I want to be your husband.

01:18:08.916 --> 01:18:11.874
You should be. I hate my husband.

01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:14.833
Sometimes I'll just
look at him and be like, "God!"

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:19.541
No. He's a good guy.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:22.708
And he loves you so much.

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:26.833
And he's going to love this baby.
That's who I'm really jealous of.

01:18:27.916 --> 01:18:31.624
This baby gets to have
the coolest, funniest,

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:34.333
most badass mom in the whole world.

01:18:35.375 --> 01:18:37.416
You forgot to say sexiest.

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:41.500
Most fuckable mom. This baby...

01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:44.291
No, but really.

01:18:45.625 --> 01:18:47.750
This kid is lucky.

01:18:48.916 --> 01:18:50.082
You really think so?

01:18:50.083 --> 01:18:53.375
Are you serious?
You're the only family I've ever known.

01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:57.040
You getting your own family made me, like,

01:18:57.041 --> 01:19:00.708
just crazy and desperate
to find my own soulmate.

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.708
Bitch, I'm your soulmate.

01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:05.416

Hey.

01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:34.458
I saw the baby on Instagram.

01:19:35.166 --> 01:19:36.499
She's perfect.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.208
Uh, it's a he.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.332
I'm the worst.

01:19:44.333 --> 01:19:47.875
I'm not the kind of person who's going to
comfort someone who's hurt me.

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:51.041
That's fair.

01:19:52.916 --> 01:19:55.375
All I ever wanted was to be a mom.

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.250
Since I was a little girl.

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:00.541
So I put that bump on.

01:20:01.125 --> 01:20:02.833
I went to that stupid yoga class.

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.833
And I met you. And I couldn't help
but want to be friends with you.

01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:09.916
And I got stuck.

01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:12.999
You could have just told me.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.666
I know what a mindfuck it is
being a woman, pregnant or not.

01:20:16.416 --> 01:20:19.875
Well, I wanted to tell you. I was just...

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:24.999
Do you remember what it's like
to want a family so bad?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.208
Of course. Of course.

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:32.832
I've just always wanted someone
to choose me. You know?

01:20:32.833 --> 01:20:34.125
Lainy.

01:20:35.166 --> 01:20:39.041
The most important relationship you are
ever going to have is with yourself.

01:20:42.041 --> 01:20:43.540
Well, I miss you, girl.

01:20:43.541 --> 01:20:44.791
Come here.

01:20:48.833 --> 01:20:50.499
I'm so sorry.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.624
It's okay.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:54.333
Oh my God.
I was just watching this thing and I...

01:20:58.333 --> 01:20:59.583
Oh my God.

01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:03.082
Oh, no, no! No!

01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:05.083
- Yes. Yes.
- No! No!

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:06.958
- No!
- Oh my God, Josh!

01:21:07.583 --> 01:21:09.790
- Hey, you get down from there right now!
- No!

01:21:09.791 --> 01:21:11.375
The neighbors are staring!

01:21:12.416 --> 01:21:13.957
I'm not coming down ever!

01:21:13.958 --> 01:21:17.165
Josh, can I please talk to you
for a minute? Just one minute.

01:21:17.166 --> 01:21:18.874
Why? So you can tell me another lie?

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:22.124
You're not a teacher.
You're really a lighthouse keeper.

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:23.500
I lied.

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:27.582
I lied to you when I told you
that I got pregnant on Thanksgiving.

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:31.499
I lied to you when I said
I do charity work for animals.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.290
I don't. I've never done
any charity work, ever.

01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:38.874
I donate canned goods
if they're doing a drive or something,

01:21:38.875 --> 01:21:42.499
but it's just the stuff
I don't want to eat, really, you know?

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.415
French cut green beans,
creamed corn. I, you know...

01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:48.374
I like cream corn.

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:49.290
Steve.

01:21:49.291 --> 01:21:53.958
The point is that I'm not lying to you
when I say I am totally in love with you.

01:21:54.916 --> 01:21:57.666
I know it's a big ask,
but can we just start over?

01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:01.125
My name's not Sasha Fierce.

01:22:02.666 --> 01:22:03.583
Hi.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.458
My name is Lainy Newton.

01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:08.708
What's yours?

01:22:14.708 --> 01:22:17.416
Haven't you ever done
something stupid for love?

01:22:24.166 --> 01:22:26.083
Well, it was wrong, and I'm sorry.

01:22:45.416 --> 01:22:46.583
Ow, my arms.

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:18.416
Can I come in?

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:21.208
No.

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:23.291
I brought steak frites.

01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:34.583
So how you been feeling?

01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:36.832
What do you want, Dave?

01:23:36.833 --> 01:23:39.083
I've never known you
to be this considerate.

01:23:40.666 --> 01:23:41.625
Is it mine?

01:23:45.833 --> 01:23:48.124
- Yes.
- Crap, dammit, I knew it.

01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:50.583
I fucking knew it. I knew it.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.582
They're yours.

01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:54.666
They?

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:57.750
What, like twins?

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.540
Three? Oh, no.

01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:03.915
How? How? [sobs] Oh my God!

01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:04.916
Oh, wait.

01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:10.708
No, I can't. I can't do that.

01:24:11.708 --> 01:24:13.749
Oh, my life's over. Shit!

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:15.290
No, that's good. That's good.

01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:17.915
Yeah, we're gonna...
Yeah, three. That's crazy.

01:24:17.916 --> 01:24:19.583
You gonna keep all of them, or...

01:24:20.166 --> 01:24:21.541
God, you suck!

01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:26.582
Oh, it's not real? That's not real?

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.790
Oh, my... Oh, thank God.

01:24:28.791 --> 01:24:32.666
Fuck yeah! It's not real. Yes!

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:36.749
You are such a dick.

01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:38.375
You're a dick.

01:24:39.166 --> 01:24:41.082
I mean, four years.

01:24:41.083 --> 01:24:44.333
Four fucking years.
Were you ever in love with me?

01:24:44.916 --> 01:24:46.332
Lainy, yes.

01:24:46.333 --> 01:24:47.500
I was.

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:50.958
Now, did I fall out of love with you? Yes.

01:24:54.375 --> 01:24:55.291
I'm sorry.

01:24:56.333 --> 01:24:58.207
I'm sorry I couldn't make you happy.

01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:00.708
No, Lainy, it's not you.

01:25:01.916 --> 01:25:04.374
I realized that I couldn't make you happy.

01:25:04.375 --> 01:25:08.499
You know, you wanted
to be a wife and a mom,

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.625
and I thought I wanted that, too, but...

01:25:13.166 --> 01:25:16.166
I realized that I wanted so much more...

01:25:17.916 --> 01:25:19.666
- Success.
- Pussy.

01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:27.583
I do still love you, though.

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:30.333
I want you to be okay.

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:32.957
That's sweet.

01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:34.791
I'm sweet.

01:25:36.458 --> 01:25:38.208
You wanna bone one more time?

01:25:38.708 --> 01:25:39.750
No.

01:25:40.916 --> 01:25:42.332
Why don't you head back over there...

01:25:42.333 --> 01:25:43.750
- ...before I stab you?
- Right. Okay.

Ms. Newton,

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:57.124
learning about female selves
is mad boring.

01:26:57.125 --> 01:26:59.666
- Shut off, Liam.
- Okay.

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:01.832

01:27:07.541 --> 01:27:09.624

You know, I once stole my own car

01:27:50.416 --> 01:27:54.375
so I could use the insurance money
to buy my girlfriend a bag.

01:27:54.958 --> 01:27:57.791
- A bag?
- Yeah, like a designer bag.

01:27:58.875 --> 01:28:00.707
That's really stupid.

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.291
Yeah. Lainy...

01:28:03.458 --> 01:28:04.625
you are insane.

01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:08.125
Really, I think
you may be clinically insane,

01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:11.958
but you make me laugh so much.

01:28:12.583 --> 01:28:14.290
I love the way you look at me.

01:28:14.291 --> 01:28:16.582
And I love looking at you.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:18.000
Aw.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:22.125
I had the best sex I've ever had with you
and I didn't see anything.

01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:28.915
You know, someone once said,
"Watch out for love,

01:28:28.916 --> 01:28:32.833
unless it is true
and every part of you says yes...

01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:35.541
including the toes."
