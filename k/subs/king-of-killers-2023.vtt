WEBVTT

01:43.847 --> 01:46.111
Daddy,
I'm scared. I miss Mommy.

01:47.764 --> 01:48.939
Marcus?

02:00.125 --> 02:03.040
Uh-huh.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.912
Just remember for next time.

02:04.912 --> 02:07.219
I don't like meeting clients
this late at night.

02:07.219 --> 02:09.873
I know. I know. Trust me.

02:09.873 --> 02:13.138
But, look, you know
how the company is.
They need to close.

02:13.138 --> 02:15.488
And you're the best closer
the company has.

02:15.488 --> 02:17.577
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to beg?

02:17.577 --> 02:19.492
No, you don't have to beg.

02:19.492 --> 02:21.624
But dinner...
that'd be nice.

02:21.624 --> 02:24.366
You got it. Call me
with some good news
when you're done.

02:49.565 --> 02:50.740
Hey, what can I get you?

02:56.485 --> 02:58.879
- How about a Shirley Temple?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.272
- Are you sure?

03:01.751 --> 03:02.839
I like to live dangerously.

03:03.797 --> 03:05.364
Okay.

03:22.424 --> 03:24.252
- Back to the other bar.

03:36.569 --> 03:38.092
- Hold on. Get lost.
- Hey.

03:45.055 --> 03:46.753
Please. Please.

03:47.841 --> 03:49.321
I can pay--

05:05.614 --> 05:07.007
Yeah?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.226
-  How'd it go?

05:09.226 --> 05:11.925
- Like they all do.
- Good.

05:11.925 --> 05:15.407
'Cause I got another client.
Rush job tomorrow.

05:15.407 --> 05:16.930
Tomorrow?

05:16.930 --> 05:19.324
Brother, my anniversary
is tomorrow.

05:19.324 --> 05:22.109
I got
a PTA meeting at 6:00.

05:22.109 --> 05:24.938
What? We have
a nine-to-five now?

05:24.938 --> 05:27.941
Come on. The world
doesn't stop for us.

05:34.426 --> 05:36.384
All right. What time?

05:36.384 --> 05:39.300
I'll call you with the details.
You're an ace, buddy.

05:39.909 --> 05:41.520
Live long and prosper.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.044
Yeah, yeah, the force
be with you too.

06:02.671 --> 06:04.107
- Let go.

06:04.107 --> 06:06.371
- What, what, what? I'm not.
- Stop that. Don't.

06:06.371 --> 06:07.850
Didn't do anything.

06:07.850 --> 06:08.982
- Don't.
- What?

06:08.982 --> 06:10.244
- You're doing it.
- I'm not.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.376
- You are!
- I'm not doing-- What, what?

06:11.376 --> 06:12.681
- You're doing it.
- I'm, I'm-- What?

06:20.950 --> 06:22.952
- Aah!
- Whoop.

06:33.049 --> 06:34.181
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

06:34.181 --> 06:35.748
Can I have
some more pancakes?

06:35.748 --> 06:37.663
Hmm. Yeah, okay.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.404
But how about just one,
because last time

06:39.404 --> 06:40.840
your eyes were too big
for your tummy

06:40.840 --> 06:42.711
and you got a bellyache.
Do you remember?

06:42.711 --> 06:45.018
Okay, but they're
so delicious.

06:45.018 --> 06:47.716
Well, I thank you for that.
They are pretty good,
aren't they?

06:47.716 --> 06:49.849
- Smells so good.

06:49.849 --> 06:52.504
- Oh, hey you.
- Mmm. Hey, yourself.

06:52.504 --> 06:54.549
- Daddy!

07:01.034 --> 07:04.690
Mm-hmm.

07:07.388 --> 07:09.869
-  Aha!

07:11.784 --> 07:13.873
- Aha!

07:13.873 --> 07:15.744
- La la la la la!
- La la la la la!

07:16.789 --> 07:18.617
Hey, how was work
last night?

07:18.617 --> 07:20.923
- Eventful.
- Another sale?

07:20.923 --> 07:22.011
Come on.

07:22.795 --> 07:24.492
- Who are you talking to?
- Okay.

07:24.492 --> 07:25.798
Well, that's what
I like to hear.

07:25.798 --> 07:26.973
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

07:26.973 --> 07:28.627
- Mm-mm-mm.
- So...

07:28.627 --> 07:30.455
What are we gonna do tonight?

07:31.064 --> 07:32.457
- Tonight?
- Hmm.

07:32.457 --> 07:33.632
What do you
wanna do tonight?

07:35.416 --> 07:36.938
- I--
- Well, there's a game on.

07:39.072 --> 07:40.508
- You forgot, didn't you?
- Forgot?

07:42.641 --> 07:44.337
- About?
- Ugh.

07:44.337 --> 07:47.384
- You suck!
- Oh. [laughs] Come on.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.083
How could I forget about the day
I married my unicorn?

07:50.083 --> 07:51.563
- You better keep it that way.
- Mm-hmm.

07:51.563 --> 07:54.609
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm working on it. Mm-hmm.

07:54.609 --> 07:57.220
- Okay. I gotta go. Love you.
-  Bye.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.395
- Love you.
- I'll see you later.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.875
- Daddy's got to work.
- Bye.

07:59.875 --> 08:01.442
- Bye.
- Well,

08:01.442 --> 08:03.705
- guess it's just you
and me, hey, kiddo.
- Yeah.

08:11.713 --> 08:16.283
- Yeah?

08:16.283 --> 08:17.850
We're still on
for tonight, right?

08:17.850 --> 08:19.591
Eight p.m. at the Coal Train.

08:19.591 --> 08:21.114
The rest is
coming over by text.

08:21.897 --> 08:23.769
Right, tonight,
8:00 p.m. I got it.

09:57.340 --> 09:58.298
Mm...

10:00.561 --> 10:01.606
Marcus?

10:03.825 --> 10:05.566
Oh.
I'm so sorry.

10:23.062 --> 10:24.063
What do we have?

10:24.890 --> 10:25.804
This.

10:28.371 --> 10:30.635
- What the hell does that do?

10:30.635 --> 10:33.289
The real question is
what can't it do?

10:34.900 --> 10:38.164
This is what they call
a "crystal matrix unit."

10:38.164 --> 10:40.514
It will replace hard
drives of any type.

10:40.514 --> 10:45.214
Each one of these
can contain data
of a million supercomputers.

10:47.216 --> 10:48.261
Marcus?

10:51.743 --> 10:56.748
If anything has a basis
for artificial intelligence,
this is it.

11:03.842 --> 11:05.452
Who are we selling it to?

11:06.975 --> 11:13.895
The Chinese,
then Arabs, Nigerians,
and of course, the Russians.

11:17.420 --> 11:18.508
Get up.

11:22.643 --> 11:23.731
Can I help you?

11:23.731 --> 11:24.819
H-hey, brother.

11:30.172 --> 11:32.827
Dimaz, what is going on?

11:36.483 --> 11:37.876
No, no, no, no, no, no!

12:01.160 --> 12:02.161
No, no!

13:01.742 --> 13:02.787
Marcus?

13:09.445 --> 13:10.620
Baby!

13:10.620 --> 13:12.797
Wait! No, no, no. No!

13:12.797 --> 13:14.886
Wait-- Kar--

13:16.931 --> 13:18.019
No!

13:20.065 --> 13:22.807
Baby! Baby,
baby, baby...

13:24.330 --> 13:25.592
Baby...

14:36.706 --> 14:39.274
Morning, Marc.
How'd you sleep?

14:40.623 --> 14:42.321
Good, good.

14:43.626 --> 14:45.324
- Coffee?

14:45.324 --> 14:47.326
Thanks, but I really
don't have time.

14:47.326 --> 14:49.545
I mean, I'm already
late for work.

14:49.545 --> 14:51.852
Marc, sit down.

15:06.649 --> 15:09.304
Ms. Aitkens, look, um,

15:09.304 --> 15:14.222
I am extremely grateful
that you moved in after Karla.

15:14.222 --> 15:16.746
How could I not wanna take care
of my own grandbaby?

15:18.444 --> 15:19.706
Still, I mean--

15:19.706 --> 15:21.229
This isn't about me, Marc.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.623
This is about you.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.192
You've got to start
living your life again.

15:28.236 --> 15:30.543
I notice it and Kimberley
notices it too.

15:30.543 --> 15:32.371
You're not happy.

15:32.371 --> 15:34.590
And when you're not happy,
that affects Kimberley,

15:34.590 --> 15:36.288
because she feels helpless.

15:38.943 --> 15:41.075
She's already lost her mother.

15:41.684 --> 15:43.904
She doesn't need to lose
her father as well.

16:21.855 --> 16:22.899
Don't worry, baby.

16:24.945 --> 16:26.947
I'll find out who did this.

16:58.587 --> 17:02.069
Hello, Mr. Garan.
My name is Roman Korza,

17:02.069 --> 17:04.114
and you are cordially invited

17:04.114 --> 17:06.987
to enter into
an exclusive contract

17:06.987 --> 17:09.946
to eliminate the world's
greatest assassin.

17:11.339 --> 17:14.386
You will be wired
ten million dollars

17:14.386 --> 17:16.475
upon services rendered.

17:16.475 --> 17:20.131
RSVP by texting the letter Y

17:20.131 --> 17:23.699
to 323-309.

17:24.396 --> 17:26.614
Upon receiving confirmation,

17:26.614 --> 17:30.489
you will be wired expenses
to travel to Tokyo.

17:30.489 --> 17:32.491
Arigato.

17:34.971 --> 17:40.499
Happy birthday, dear Kimberley.

17:40.499 --> 17:44.894
Happy birthday to you.

17:46.157 --> 17:47.288
Make a wish.

17:53.207 --> 17:55.905
-  Oh!
Good girl!
- There you go.

17:55.905 --> 17:57.124
What'd you wish for?

17:58.865 --> 18:01.302
I wished for Daddy
to be happy.

18:04.044 --> 18:06.916
Kiddo. Daddy is happy.

18:07.743 --> 18:09.832
And as long as
I have you, I'm happy.

18:09.832 --> 18:10.920
Come here.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.536
Okay, let's open
some presents.

18:17.536 --> 18:19.146
- Okay? Let's do it.

18:21.105 --> 18:22.541
Wonder what it is.

19:04.235 --> 19:06.498
Mr. Garan, well, I can
assure you don't need that.

19:06.498 --> 19:07.977
- I'm only here to talk.
- May I?

19:09.414 --> 19:10.415
Thank you.

19:13.592 --> 19:15.115
How'd you find me?

19:15.115 --> 19:16.856
We have our resources.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.296
I wanna know why you haven't
accepted my invitation.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.604
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.998
Thanks, but no thanks.

19:30.304 --> 19:32.785
As you can see,
I have more important
things to do.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.441
We know who you are, Marcus.

19:37.311 --> 19:39.574
A former company man
with all the related benefits.

19:40.836 --> 19:42.447
And actually once
top of your game.

19:43.535 --> 19:47.452
Of course, within your limited
sphere of influence.

19:54.459 --> 19:57.984
We also know a tragic incident
took your wife

19:59.594 --> 20:00.943
and shattered your life.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.470
And for that, I offer
my deepest condolences.

20:06.558 --> 20:08.951
And now I know you're focused
on tracking her killer.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.868
Word in our community
travels fast.

20:14.261 --> 20:16.089
Now, I've offered you
a chance of a lifetime.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.570
Look after your family.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.270
You heard of Jorg Drakos?

20:25.881 --> 20:27.056
Who hasn't?

20:28.710 --> 20:30.799
Former Greek EYP lifer

20:31.583 --> 20:33.976
said to have killed more people
than the plague.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.719
Some say he's a myth.

20:40.722 --> 20:42.898
- What about him?
- The King of Killers,

20:44.160 --> 20:46.815
my employer,
he wants him eliminated.

20:47.729 --> 20:48.991
Who's your employer?

20:48.991 --> 20:50.819
Oh, come on,
you know the drill.

20:50.819 --> 20:53.257
Need-to-know basis,
but you don't need to know.

20:53.257 --> 20:54.954
Is that a fact?

20:56.216 --> 20:58.392
Let's cut the crap out, Marcus.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.916
I know you're interested.

21:05.704 --> 21:08.533
I gave up that life
a long time ago.

21:09.403 --> 21:11.318
I'm all my daughter's got left.

21:12.667 --> 21:13.625
Yes.

21:14.495 --> 21:16.628
But ten million dollars,

21:16.628 --> 21:20.545
that's enough to take care
of you and Kimberley
for the rest of your life.

21:20.545 --> 21:22.938
I mean, that will give her
the life that she deserves,

21:22.938 --> 21:25.506
a good education, a trust fund.

21:28.727 --> 21:31.425
It can't be easy being
a single parent these days.

21:35.516 --> 21:36.952
I'll be expecting your call.

21:38.606 --> 21:39.825
Let's talk soon, Mr. Garan.

21:41.435 --> 21:42.567
Let's talk soon.

21:49.965 --> 21:50.923
Hello?

22:05.851 --> 22:10.203
Mr. Garan, Dr. Dean,
head of cardiac pediatrics.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.074
Hey, Doc.
Nice to meet you.

22:16.296 --> 22:17.645
What's wrong
with my daughter?

22:19.952 --> 22:21.519
Let's step over here.

22:28.961 --> 22:33.661
I'm sorry, but Kimberley's scan
shows an abnormally large heart,

22:33.661 --> 22:36.969
specifically affecting
her lower chambers,
her ventricles.

22:39.754 --> 22:41.539
I knew she had
a heart murmur, but--

22:41.539 --> 22:44.368
No, this is much more
serious than that.

22:44.368 --> 22:47.240
In fact, I daresay
she was misdiagnosed.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.591
Her heart is deteriorating.

22:52.201 --> 22:55.727
This will lead
to heart failure.

22:59.731 --> 23:01.559
-  Daddy?

23:01.559 --> 23:02.734
Hey, kiddo.

23:04.779 --> 23:07.695
- I'm right here.
Daddy's right here.

23:07.695 --> 23:09.436
Am I gonna be okay?

23:09.436 --> 23:12.396
Yeah, of course.
You'll be fine.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.267
Hey...

23:15.573 --> 23:18.532
God is gonna look
over you, and so will I.

23:22.797 --> 23:25.321
Hey, kiddo, look at me.

23:26.627 --> 23:28.020
It's you and me
forever, right?

23:28.020 --> 23:29.325
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:08.887 --> 24:10.497
-  Mr. Garan.
- I'm in.

24:19.550 --> 24:21.029
I knew you weren't finished.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.294
You're the best
the Alphabet Club ever had.

24:26.557 --> 24:29.124
- So, who's the client?
- Jorg Drakos.

24:29.124 --> 24:30.822
What? You're kidding.

24:33.041 --> 24:36.088
I doubt they even know
where he is.
Nobody's ever seen his face.

24:36.088 --> 24:37.350
You sure you want
a piece of that?

24:37.350 --> 24:38.438
No choice.

24:39.047 --> 24:41.354
Someone wants him dead.
And I need the money.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.748
You've never been motivated
by money before.

24:44.531 --> 24:45.576
What's changed?

24:45.576 --> 24:46.794
This is different.

24:52.017 --> 24:53.627
Are you okay?

24:53.627 --> 24:55.368
'Cause I know you've been
obsessing about Karla's death

24:55.368 --> 24:57.283
and trying to find out
who might have killed her.

24:58.458 --> 24:59.677
Obsessing?

24:59.677 --> 25:01.809
I didn't mean it like that
and you know it.

25:01.809 --> 25:03.376
I loved her like a sister, man.

25:04.856 --> 25:08.424
It's just-- I think
it was a matter of her
being at the wrong place

25:08.424 --> 25:10.339
- at the wrong time.
- It's Kimberley.

25:11.471 --> 25:13.995
- What?
- It's Kimberley.

25:15.649 --> 25:16.737
She's sick.

25:20.088 --> 25:21.829
She needs a new heart.

25:24.005 --> 25:26.094
And what I have
just won't cover it.

25:28.096 --> 25:29.228
I'm sorry.

25:31.143 --> 25:32.840
Look, I got a little
something tucked away.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.234
- It's yours if you need it.
- I appreciate that.

25:36.322 --> 25:38.933
I really do.
But you have a family too.

25:41.414 --> 25:42.937
I got to do this.

25:42.937 --> 25:45.592
And it's the only way
I know how.

25:45.592 --> 25:46.767
I understand.

25:48.813 --> 25:49.770
Okay.

25:51.598 --> 25:54.645
I need a complete rundown
on Drakos.

25:55.471 --> 25:56.690
Problem is,

25:57.473 --> 25:59.737
I don't have
my security clearance anymore.

25:59.737 --> 26:00.694
Right.

26:02.740 --> 26:04.132
Let me see what I can do.

26:05.307 --> 26:08.267
So, where are they sending you?

26:50.048 --> 26:52.180
Mr. Garan.

26:53.617 --> 26:57.055
I am so happy
you decided to come.

26:57.925 --> 27:00.972
Mr. Korza, one last hurrah.

27:00.972 --> 27:02.060
Indeed.

27:02.887 --> 27:05.237
You're expected
in the penthouse.

27:05.237 --> 27:08.022
My assistant, Mrs. Ueno,

27:08.022 --> 27:09.850
is waiting for us
at the elevator.

27:09.850 --> 27:11.330
Let's get started.

27:36.921 --> 27:38.226
What's this?

27:38.226 --> 27:39.924
I thought
I was working alone.

27:40.707 --> 27:43.536
Don't get your knickers
in a twist, Mr. Garan.
All in good time.

27:44.276 --> 27:45.451
All in good time.

28:02.686 --> 28:05.950
Well, I'm glad
you all can make it.

28:06.994 --> 28:10.258
Now, I know how eager
you all are to get started.

28:10.258 --> 28:13.000
So, let's make this brief.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.829
I had no idea
I was gonna be part of a team.

28:15.829 --> 28:17.657
I work alone.

28:17.657 --> 28:20.007
I don't need these lame ducks
getting in my way.

28:20.007 --> 28:21.313
Hmpf.

28:22.488 --> 28:24.055
Man, who you calling
a "lame duck"?

28:24.925 --> 28:26.884
- I'm looking at one.
- Oh, really now?

28:28.624 --> 28:30.235
Gentleman, gentleman.

28:31.192 --> 28:34.369
Please, I think it's time
you met my employer.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.635
Hello.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.028
Oh, it's good to see you all.

28:41.028 --> 28:42.073
Thank you for coming.

28:42.813 --> 28:44.031
Hope you had a good trip in.

28:44.031 --> 28:45.293
You set all this up?

28:45.293 --> 28:46.381
I did.

28:47.078 --> 28:49.428
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

28:49.428 --> 28:52.083
That's good question. I...

28:53.127 --> 28:54.476
I'm your employer.

28:55.477 --> 28:58.089
I'm also a great admirer
of your work.

28:58.089 --> 29:00.831
You're all the very best
in the world at what you do,

29:00.831 --> 29:03.355
which make you worthy
for the task at hand.

29:06.445 --> 29:07.576
Marcus Garan,

29:08.664 --> 29:12.668
multidisciplinary "wetman"
for the US Intelligence Community

29:12.668 --> 29:14.496
with foreign loan-out options

29:16.194 --> 29:19.501
till an unfortunate accident
took out the love of his life.

29:20.372 --> 29:21.939
That is too bad.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.553
Scott Angus, deposed J2 member

29:27.553 --> 29:30.730
and client of any organized
good guys, or even terrorists,

29:30.730 --> 29:32.601
with the right amount
of legal tender.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.039
You like your money.

29:36.083 --> 29:38.956
Only hit the wrong mark
setting off a war
between terrorist factions.

29:38.956 --> 29:41.697
Now, they all want you dead.

29:43.264 --> 29:45.658
Asha Khanna.

29:45.658 --> 29:48.487
MI6 operative
for the past 15 years,

29:48.487 --> 29:52.839
could have any agency
position she wanted,
but got tired of the rat race.

29:53.622 --> 29:54.972
Dyson Chord,

29:55.886 --> 29:59.193
former Marine Force
recon Commander
for the elite Darkstorms unit

29:59.193 --> 30:01.979
and NSA sweeper.

30:03.807 --> 30:04.938
Rick Nigel,

30:06.461 --> 30:08.333
freelance ASIS employee.

30:08.333 --> 30:10.378
Played too many sides
once too often

30:10.378 --> 30:12.206
that he almost put
a hit on himself.

30:12.206 --> 30:13.599
Who writes this stuff?

30:16.645 --> 30:18.647
A man known as Ren.

30:19.344 --> 30:23.000
Miyacho-trained,
protector of the Rising Sun,
until loyalties changed

30:23.000 --> 30:25.089
and started working
for the highest bidder.

30:27.221 --> 30:28.396
And last,

30:28.396 --> 30:30.050
Zachary Hebron,

30:30.050 --> 30:32.313
freelance sniper
for a private military company.

30:32.313 --> 30:35.012
Following orders is not
exactly his strong suit.

30:37.666 --> 30:38.711
Wow!

30:39.668 --> 30:40.931
Wow, wow, wow.

30:41.975 --> 30:44.630
Checkmate. Yeah.

30:44.630 --> 30:47.981
I do have a bit
of a confession to make.

30:47.981 --> 30:50.201
You're probably wondering
about your quarry.

30:50.201 --> 30:52.116
The assassin
they say is the best.

30:52.725 --> 30:53.987
Drakos?

30:53.987 --> 30:56.120
- No one's even seen his face.
-  No.

30:56.860 --> 30:58.818
Maybe he's not that
good-looking.

30:59.688 --> 31:02.866
Look, I just wanna get
this thing started,
so I can collect my money.

31:02.866 --> 31:04.476
That'll be the day, mate.

31:05.390 --> 31:07.914
- What?
- Yeah, you heard me.

31:07.914 --> 31:09.307
How about I give you
a running head start?

31:09.307 --> 31:10.786
Anytime, mate.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.527
- Anytime.

31:13.485 --> 31:16.575
No. Patience is a virtue,
Mr. Hebron.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.100
But I do have some...

31:21.275 --> 31:22.363
bad news.

31:23.060 --> 31:25.410
I don't know what
you've been told.
I really don't care.

31:25.410 --> 31:28.326
I just, uh, want you to know
that this isn't
your typical contract.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.763
Then what is it?

31:30.763 --> 31:33.461
It's more like a competition.

31:33.461 --> 31:35.681
- What?
- A game!

31:35.681 --> 31:37.552
A game, a competition.

31:38.902 --> 31:43.645
See who's the best
by killing the best.

31:45.038 --> 31:46.126
Jorg Drakos.

31:46.779 --> 31:50.696
Okay, wait,
you want us to compete

31:50.696 --> 31:53.133
to see which one of us
can get to him first.

31:53.133 --> 31:54.221
Yes.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.574
Well, this should be fun.

31:59.574 --> 32:02.316
No, no. I'm out.

32:02.316 --> 32:04.840
Oh, this game
you'll play, Mr. Hebron.

32:06.494 --> 32:08.888
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?
-  Mr. Hebron.

32:10.368 --> 32:12.239
See, I think you should
change your mind.

32:13.153 --> 32:15.199
It's not really a good idea.

32:16.156 --> 32:17.549
You lied to us
in the beginning.

32:19.116 --> 32:20.726
The way I see it
is I don't know you.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.338
I don't know your boss.
And I sure as hell
don't trust you.

32:24.338 --> 32:25.949
Anybody else
care to join?

32:27.820 --> 32:28.864
Killer queen?

32:29.474 --> 32:30.518
Not I.

32:30.518 --> 32:31.824
Green Mile?

32:32.868 --> 32:33.826
No?

32:36.960 --> 32:38.135
See you, mate.

32:38.135 --> 32:39.223
I'm out.

32:45.316 --> 32:47.492
I told you, mate.

32:47.971 --> 32:49.537
That'll be the day.
I told you that.

32:57.589 --> 32:59.373
Now you know how serious I am.

33:00.548 --> 33:02.811
Nobody leaves
until the game is finished.

33:02.811 --> 33:04.422
His bloody head's
off his shoulders.

33:05.379 --> 33:07.816
- You deceived us.
- Maybe.

33:07.816 --> 33:08.817
Maybe.

33:10.210 --> 33:12.952
But I expect you all to play
to the best of your abilities.

33:12.952 --> 33:15.215
Your lives depend on it.
You understand me?

33:15.215 --> 33:17.609
We don't even know
what Drakos looks like.

33:19.089 --> 33:20.133
Sure you do.

33:23.354 --> 33:26.487
You are Drakos-san.

33:30.709 --> 33:31.753
I am.

33:35.627 --> 33:37.368
Wait, I'm not getting this.

33:37.368 --> 33:39.370
Why hire us to kill you?

33:39.370 --> 33:41.328
Why?

33:42.112 --> 33:43.548
I love "why" questions.

33:45.550 --> 33:46.855
What does it all mean?

33:47.943 --> 33:49.510
I'm the best.
I've done it all.

33:51.773 --> 33:53.079
I've conquered it all.

33:54.428 --> 33:55.647
Except for one thing.

33:57.083 --> 33:59.346
The elimination of my peers.

34:00.217 --> 34:03.481
You, the other assassins,

34:03.481 --> 34:05.048
to see who really is the best.

34:07.267 --> 34:11.010
And you expect us
to go along with that?

34:12.445 --> 34:13.447
Is that right?

34:14.796 --> 34:17.320
Well, you could ask Mr. Hebron
that question.

34:19.932 --> 34:21.541
I trust you understand.

34:24.501 --> 34:25.720
The job is simple.

34:27.070 --> 34:29.289
To kill me, King of Killers.

34:30.073 --> 34:31.291
How fun does that sound?

34:36.992 --> 34:38.864
But I want you to get
some rest first.

34:38.864 --> 34:40.344
Mr. Korza is gonna
hand you a card,

34:40.344 --> 34:41.954
give you access
to my entire facility.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.651
It's a wonderful place.

34:43.651 --> 34:45.088
You can sleep, you can eat,

34:45.088 --> 34:46.654
you can work out
to your heart's content.

34:46.654 --> 34:47.960
Why, thank you.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.832
In 24 hours, you have one job,

34:51.920 --> 34:53.704
and that is to kill me,

34:53.704 --> 34:57.839
or I can guarantee
I will kill you.

34:59.276 --> 35:02.105
Now, we have a light
supper and, uh, tea

35:02.105 --> 35:03.497
in the lobby
of the hotel later.

35:03.497 --> 35:05.020
I expect all of you
to be there.

35:07.327 --> 35:08.546
See you later.

35:14.508 --> 35:17.729
Well, I hope
that was informative.

35:19.513 --> 35:23.343
You have 24 hours to prepare.

35:23.343 --> 35:26.607
Please, use your time wisely,

35:26.607 --> 35:30.133
'cause it may be the last time
you have left on this earth.

35:31.960 --> 35:36.922
And, uh, if anyone else
should have any ideas

35:36.922 --> 35:39.620
to depart this event early,

35:39.620 --> 35:41.144
just remember one thing,

35:42.536 --> 35:44.930
someone is always watching.

36:57.394 --> 36:59.570
Curiosity killed
the cat, you know.

37:02.094 --> 37:05.184
Lucky for you, Asha.
You always land on your feet.

37:06.533 --> 37:07.534
Lucky me.

37:09.362 --> 37:11.451
It's good
to see you, Garan.

37:11.451 --> 37:12.713
Stop lying.

37:14.237 --> 37:16.891
Last time we saw each other,
you tried to take me out.

37:16.891 --> 37:18.328
Well, you deserved it.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.896
Playing doubles
with the Alphabet Squad

37:21.896 --> 37:25.596
doesn't exactly make
for influencing people
or making new friends.

37:27.467 --> 37:29.164
But I forgive you.

37:29.164 --> 37:33.125
So, why are you here?

37:33.125 --> 37:34.213
Listen,

37:37.129 --> 37:38.609
I heard about Karla.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.265
Let's not.

37:43.004 --> 37:43.962
Okay.

37:45.485 --> 37:47.966
- Then business it is.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.142
What do you know about Drakos?

37:50.925 --> 37:54.320
Other than he's
standing in my way
of ten million dollars. Nothing.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.365
Really?

37:57.018 --> 37:58.281
Now who's lying?

38:00.805 --> 38:01.762
Okay.

38:03.590 --> 38:06.332
What I know is
he's holding all the cards.

38:06.332 --> 38:08.291
His turf, his rules.

38:08.291 --> 38:12.251
And if I didn't know any better,
I'd say that's not a window.

38:15.907 --> 38:17.300
A monitor.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.085
Doesn't matter.

38:20.955 --> 38:22.305
I have nothing to hide.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.655
Just everything to lose.

38:27.310 --> 38:30.182
- All I know is I need to win.
- To win...

38:30.922 --> 38:32.358
that prize.

38:37.711 --> 38:38.756
We'll see.

38:40.018 --> 38:43.326
- Death is just a part of life.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.313
What is this?

39:15.096 --> 39:18.361
He's our host,
showing us a good time

39:19.579 --> 39:23.017
right before one of us
takes him out.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.455
Sure.

39:25.455 --> 39:27.108
I'd love a nice spot of tea

39:27.108 --> 39:28.458
before I carve my name

39:28.458 --> 39:29.676
into his chest.

39:34.942 --> 39:36.379
Contestants,

39:37.945 --> 39:40.165
it is with great pleasure

39:40.165 --> 39:42.820
that the esteemed Mr. Drakos

39:42.820 --> 39:45.126
welcomes you to Japan.

39:46.432 --> 39:51.089
This is a simple dinner
like a thank you

39:51.089 --> 39:53.396
for being competitors
in our event.

39:54.658 --> 39:57.356
Or perhaps, for some of you,

39:58.401 --> 39:59.706
a last supper.

40:03.536 --> 40:05.973
What? We get a door prize too?

40:05.973 --> 40:07.540
So, where is Drakos?

40:08.149 --> 40:09.803
- I am here.

40:11.979 --> 40:14.373
Call me superstitious,
but I don't like to see
the participants

40:14.373 --> 40:15.548
before the event.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.596
Kind of like the groom
shouldn't see the bride
before the wedding.

40:19.596 --> 40:21.424
You leave
nothing to chance.

40:21.424 --> 40:22.773
You catch on quick.

40:23.556 --> 40:25.819
But never mind
all that for now.

40:26.603 --> 40:30.215
Tonight, I want you to enjoy
a well-deserved respite.
Agreed?

40:31.521 --> 40:32.609
A toast.

40:33.610 --> 40:34.959
Gentlemen and lady.

40:36.090 --> 40:37.962
Thank you for accepting
my offer.

40:39.529 --> 40:40.573
Welcome to Japan.

40:41.835 --> 40:43.228
May we fight hard

40:44.664 --> 40:45.752
and die with honor.

40:48.799 --> 40:51.279
Cheers. Till tomorrow.

41:08.906 --> 41:10.124
Enjoy your dinner.

41:11.256 --> 41:12.300
Until later.

41:23.790 --> 41:26.314
You know,
it's really interesting.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.796
Here we are,
the best in the world
at what we do.

41:29.796 --> 41:31.798
And none of us
have ever really met.

41:32.538 --> 41:34.061
Some of us have.

41:34.975 --> 41:36.150
A lifetime ago.

41:39.023 --> 41:39.980
Yeah.

41:41.242 --> 41:44.463
It's a small world we live in,
isn't it, boys?

41:44.463 --> 41:46.204
Reputations
are like that.

41:46.204 --> 41:50.861
CIA, FBI, NSA, MI6.

41:50.861 --> 41:52.732
They always make sure
we're informed,

41:52.732 --> 41:55.126
even if you're
on the other side.

41:55.126 --> 41:57.084
Something doesn't sit right.

41:57.084 --> 42:01.872
I'm thinking this contest
has nothing to do
with money, or ego.

42:02.960 --> 42:04.091
She ain't wrong.

42:04.875 --> 42:07.181
What's this old boy up to? Hmm?

42:07.181 --> 42:08.835
Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth,

42:08.835 --> 42:11.446
fool and his money
will soon part,

42:11.446 --> 42:14.667
and this fool
will make sure it does.

42:14.667 --> 42:16.887
We're all, uh, happy
with that, are we?

42:16.887 --> 42:19.280
I think our boy here
is looking for a thrill.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.892
Is he, mate?
Is that what he's after?

42:22.719 --> 42:24.329
- Do you know something
we don't know?
-  Please, please,

42:24.329 --> 42:25.896
please, please.

42:25.896 --> 42:27.506
Think about it.

42:27.506 --> 42:29.508
How is this different
than any other contract

42:29.508 --> 42:31.423
we've ever taken, huh?

42:35.470 --> 42:36.646
Have to take this.

42:38.778 --> 42:39.997
Is it that important?

42:41.128 --> 42:42.782
So, how's she doing?

42:42.782 --> 42:44.044
Oh, she's fine.

42:44.044 --> 42:45.959
She just wanted
to say good night.

42:45.959 --> 42:48.266
Good night,
Daddy. I love you.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.964
I love you to the moon
and back and back again.

42:50.964 --> 42:52.705
Good night, Peanut.

42:52.705 --> 42:54.272
When are you coming home?

42:54.272 --> 42:57.188
As soon as I can, kiddo.
As soon as I can.

42:58.406 --> 42:59.973
I miss you.

42:59.973 --> 43:02.672
Oh, I miss you so much.

43:03.411 --> 43:06.850
Okay? Sweet dreams.
I'll see you very soon.

43:06.850 --> 43:07.981
Bye.

43:10.549 --> 43:11.942
Asha, I know you're there.

43:14.118 --> 43:15.728
Now, that was beautiful.

43:16.860 --> 43:17.774
So...

43:19.340 --> 43:21.647
how should we play this game?

43:21.647 --> 43:23.606
This is the same game
we've always played.

43:24.824 --> 43:25.782
Wow.

43:26.870 --> 43:29.873
You really have changed,
haven't you?

43:29.873 --> 43:31.222
What are you doing?

43:31.222 --> 43:35.095
I'm just picking up
where we left off.

43:39.752 --> 43:43.190
The less of us there are,
the better the chance
of winning.

43:54.462 --> 43:56.551
You don't have to do this.
It's not about us.

43:57.814 --> 43:59.293
Don't flatter yourself.

44:24.449 --> 44:28.235
So, I guess
you don't always land
on your feet now, do you?

45:19.678 --> 45:22.594
Daddy,
I'm scared. I miss Mommy.

45:22.594 --> 45:24.074
Oh, kiddo.

45:25.249 --> 45:29.993
Listen, your Mommy
is an angel now
and she lives in the stars.

45:30.994 --> 45:33.910
So anytime you miss Mommy,
all you have to do,

45:33.910 --> 45:37.522
you look up at the stars
and you can talk to her.

45:38.392 --> 45:41.308
And know that she's always
looking over you.

45:41.308 --> 45:42.745
Okay? So, here's
what we're gonna do.

45:43.658 --> 45:45.356
Look at this star.

45:45.356 --> 45:47.358
I'm gonna put some stars
right above your bed.

45:47.358 --> 45:49.316
So anytime
you wanna talk to Mommy,

45:49.316 --> 45:52.232
all you have to do is look up
and talk to her.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.265
You don't say much, do you?

46:26.876 --> 46:30.575
Only when there is something
that needs to be said.

46:32.577 --> 46:33.708
Contestants.

46:36.581 --> 46:40.846
I trust we are all well-rested
and refreshed.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.066
Just eager to get started.

46:43.675 --> 46:46.504
So you should be, Mr. Chord.
So you should be.

46:47.897 --> 46:52.379
Now, we of course know
the exact tool you use
in your line of work,

46:53.598 --> 46:54.773
down to the blade

46:56.427 --> 46:57.645
and to your caliber.

46:59.865 --> 47:02.955
Here, you will find
everything you need.

47:04.478 --> 47:08.178
Please come
and feast your eyes.

47:20.146 --> 47:22.105
That's what I'm talking about.

47:25.586 --> 47:28.807
Not the sniper rifle
I'm used to. But this will do.

47:40.036 --> 47:42.952
Well, I trust they're all
to your satisfaction?

47:42.952 --> 47:44.344
Are they ever?

47:44.344 --> 47:46.912
So, how does this work?

47:46.912 --> 47:48.653
- Is it a game of hide
and seek, or what?

47:48.653 --> 47:50.698
In a manner of speaking, yes.

47:53.788 --> 47:56.008
You're all gonna draw a coin
from that bag,

47:56.008 --> 47:58.141
determine which order
you'll face me.

47:58.837 --> 47:59.882
Low coin goes first.

48:00.665 --> 48:02.319
High coin goes last.

48:04.887 --> 48:06.627
Please, take one.

48:12.285 --> 48:13.243
Five.

48:15.680 --> 48:16.637
Seven.

48:19.162 --> 48:20.337
Eight.

48:23.993 --> 48:25.124
Two.

48:28.606 --> 48:29.868
Damn, six.

48:32.740 --> 48:33.698
Tsk.

48:34.655 --> 48:35.787
I guess I go first.

48:35.787 --> 48:37.223
No, you're not.

48:41.401 --> 48:43.708
- And when I get back...

48:43.708 --> 48:45.014
...dinner's on me.

48:56.242 --> 48:57.548
If he makes it back.

49:15.566 --> 49:16.523
Hey.

49:18.134 --> 49:19.135
Look at this.

49:28.231 --> 49:30.885
Ah, Angus, going first.

49:30.885 --> 49:33.540
Always the good guy.
Always the hero.

49:36.239 --> 49:37.762
Ain't that right?

49:37.762 --> 49:40.939
But this time, rushing in
to save the day

49:40.939 --> 49:42.723
might be the very
last thing you do.

49:42.723 --> 49:44.856
Drakos won't
make this one easy.

49:45.770 --> 49:47.119
He's not supposed to.

50:23.634 --> 50:24.722
What's he doing?

50:28.595 --> 50:29.814
What's going on here?

50:33.992 --> 50:35.124
It's a trap.

51:11.334 --> 51:12.596
What's he doing?

51:14.119 --> 51:16.078
- I mean...

51:35.358 --> 51:36.750
He's lost already.

51:36.750 --> 51:38.230
You are right.

51:55.465 --> 51:56.814
He's fast.

52:00.078 --> 52:01.906
You thought this was
gonna be easy, didn't ya?

52:26.670 --> 52:27.714
Where are you?

52:32.110 --> 52:33.285
- Where are you?

52:38.638 --> 52:39.900
Where are you?

53:17.155 --> 53:20.202
I will kill you.

53:20.811 --> 53:22.073
Yeah.

53:45.705 --> 53:47.968
Y'all know you're never
gonna win this.

53:47.968 --> 53:49.535
But I love your spirit.

53:59.284 --> 54:01.286
We're going about this
the wrong way.

54:03.419 --> 54:05.812
Look at the terminology he uses,

54:05.812 --> 54:08.119
the layout
of the floors.

54:08.119 --> 54:09.555
He set this whole thing up.

54:09.555 --> 54:11.427
It's a chess game.
We know this.

54:11.427 --> 54:14.256
Not a chess game.
A game of chance.

54:15.387 --> 54:17.346
Don't you get it?
He's a gambler,

54:17.346 --> 54:19.957
and gamblers
love high stakes.

54:21.611 --> 54:22.916
We can't win...

54:24.396 --> 54:26.833
'cause the house always wins.

54:26.833 --> 54:27.834
Gentlemen.

54:27.834 --> 54:29.096
And lady.

54:29.096 --> 54:30.663
Do we have a problem here?

54:31.838 --> 54:33.927
We have to change
the rules on him.

54:33.927 --> 54:35.059
How?

54:35.059 --> 54:37.844
We tell him
we'll only continue

54:37.844 --> 54:39.542
if he takes on
all of us at once.

54:41.674 --> 54:43.676
- What?
- He'll never go for it.

54:43.676 --> 54:47.593
Maybe. But I know
that the only way
we survive this

54:48.812 --> 54:50.553
is if we work together.

54:51.162 --> 54:52.859
Then we split the prize.

54:56.515 --> 54:58.648
- I concur.
- So do I.

54:59.518 --> 55:00.432
Ren?

55:05.785 --> 55:07.134
I think it's weak.

55:07.134 --> 55:08.788
So you have
a better idea?

55:08.788 --> 55:12.575
Yeah. We scrap,
and we find out
who's the best.

55:12.575 --> 55:14.316
Perfect. Then you go next.

55:14.316 --> 55:16.666
Whoa, big fella.
It's not my turn.

55:16.666 --> 55:21.758
Well, you're the only one
who wants to keep on fighting
in this death trap.

55:21.758 --> 55:23.629
So, you wanna be a fool?

55:24.630 --> 55:26.371
You know what?
Knock yourself out.

55:26.371 --> 55:28.852
- You're a coward.
- Who's next?

55:28.852 --> 55:30.201
You're not even worth it.

55:30.810 --> 55:31.898
I don't have all day.

55:33.117 --> 55:34.858
I don't care who it is.

55:34.858 --> 55:37.121
But someone has got to get
in the elevator.

55:39.341 --> 55:41.299
You led us here
under false pretenses.

55:42.387 --> 55:46.565
We were led to believe
we'd be hunting you
under much different conditions.

55:46.565 --> 55:48.175
The game is rigged.

55:48.785 --> 55:52.136
Like the Greeks say,
the rules are the rules.

55:52.136 --> 55:56.314
And I say these rules
are the only way you can win.

55:56.314 --> 55:57.533
But that's okay.

55:58.969 --> 56:00.187
I have a proposition for you.

56:01.319 --> 56:05.802
After all, you are a gentleman
and a gamesman, right?

56:06.672 --> 56:09.501
Not exactly. But I'll bite.

56:10.241 --> 56:13.244
All of us versus you simultaneously.

56:13.244 --> 56:15.855
No deal. That's not
how the game is played.

56:16.900 --> 56:18.597
So, you,

56:18.597 --> 56:21.774
the King of Killers,
is admitting he can't win?

56:22.645 --> 56:24.821
Because if that's the case,
you're not the best.

56:25.474 --> 56:28.477
You had to stack the deck
in order to achieve victory,

56:28.477 --> 56:29.608
which...

56:31.044 --> 56:35.919
really isn't the game of skill
you relish so much now, is it?

56:39.139 --> 56:43.056
Now the other way, my way,
is a true game of skill.

56:43.056 --> 56:45.798
Our numbers versus your traps.

56:49.759 --> 56:52.414
Come on, Drakos,
you're the king.

56:55.155 --> 56:57.419
Does the king care
to make a wager?

57:00.596 --> 57:02.075
Is this psychology?

57:03.250 --> 57:04.426
I think I like it.

57:07.603 --> 57:09.082
You have a deal.

57:09.082 --> 57:11.302
- Let's go.
- Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

57:12.303 --> 57:14.261
I do have one wrinkle.

57:15.611 --> 57:16.699
Of course, you do.

57:17.961 --> 57:18.962
Four.

57:19.484 --> 57:21.355
I'll only take four of you.

57:21.355 --> 57:24.837
So, one of us has to stay here.

57:24.837 --> 57:27.623
Well, I think you know me
a little better than that.

57:29.233 --> 57:30.887
One of you has
to be eliminated.

57:32.366 --> 57:33.933
One of you has to die,

57:34.586 --> 57:36.240
or all of you have to die.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.720
Your choice.

57:51.298 --> 57:53.300
- Wife killer!

57:57.348 --> 57:58.828
How dare you!

58:00.612 --> 58:02.222
Guys, guys!

58:05.878 --> 58:07.576
I hate to break this up.

58:09.099 --> 58:10.317
Chord's gone.

58:19.152 --> 58:21.285
They say that all
those horrible things
you did as an operative

58:21.285 --> 58:22.852
finally got to you.

58:22.852 --> 58:25.550
And after so many years
of decorated service,

58:25.550 --> 58:26.682
that's why you quit.

58:28.379 --> 58:30.729
But did you, Chord?

58:30.729 --> 58:32.557
Did you really walk away
from the game?

58:32.557 --> 58:34.080
I don't think so.

58:34.080 --> 58:36.256
Once a player, always a player.

58:36.256 --> 58:37.954
Just a different team.

58:37.954 --> 58:40.173
So why walk away
from this team too?

58:40.173 --> 58:42.785
You looking
for absolution, Chord?

58:42.785 --> 58:44.090
Well, come and get it.

58:55.406 --> 58:57.626
Where are you hiding this time?

59:03.109 --> 59:04.197
Drakos!

59:05.068 --> 59:06.199
Where are you?

59:07.505 --> 59:08.593
You scared?

59:18.081 --> 59:19.691
It's the calm before the storm.

59:39.711 --> 59:41.234
What's he reacting to?

59:42.714 --> 59:43.759
I don't know.

01:02:02.245 --> 01:02:03.420
Now we begin.

01:02:17.477 --> 01:02:19.958
You heard the man. Gear up.

01:02:20.742 --> 01:02:22.221
Cellphones on radio mode.

01:02:24.093 --> 01:02:25.311
Aye, Cap.

01:02:30.403 --> 01:02:32.492
I believe this
is yours, Mr. Garan.

01:02:58.301 --> 01:03:01.391
I am not sure we should
completely split up.

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.090
Ren's right.
We work as a unit.

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:06.570
Or else he'll pick us off
one by one.

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:08.311
- Oh, bugger that.

01:03:13.098 --> 01:03:14.273
See ya, kids.

01:03:17.842 --> 01:03:18.887
Let's go.

01:04:00.145 --> 01:04:01.886
- Everyone still there?

01:04:03.453 --> 01:04:04.497
Barely.

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:15.465
Let's... let's try
to find our way

01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:17.902
back to each other.

01:04:18.642 --> 01:04:19.599
Fuck!

01:04:25.214 --> 01:04:26.519
How do we do that?

01:04:27.346 --> 01:04:29.000
We don't know where we are.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.047
Clear out each floor.
Head down if you can.

01:04:32.047 --> 01:04:34.484
That is a lot of rooms.

01:04:39.445 --> 01:04:43.449
I wonder how long it took him
to put this rat race together.

01:04:43.449 --> 01:04:45.887
I'm sure he took
his sweet-ass time.

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:47.758
And money.

01:04:48.715 --> 01:04:49.847
Obviously.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:02.468
He is not going
to let us escape.

01:05:02.468 --> 01:05:03.774
That's the point.

01:06:35.344 --> 01:06:37.085
Just stay focused.

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:41.306
Let's see
if we can flush him out.

01:06:41.306 --> 01:06:43.787
Easier said than done.

01:06:50.576 --> 01:06:52.665
What happened to you, Asha?

01:06:52.665 --> 01:06:54.406
What turned you?

01:06:54.406 --> 01:06:55.973
You believed in the cause.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.422
When greed is your God,
you can never be good enough.

01:07:11.336 --> 01:07:12.598
Not to beat me.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.227
Here we go.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.538
You're a really
good assassin, Asha.

01:07:39.538 --> 01:07:42.628
Maybe the best,
just not good enough.

01:07:43.716 --> 01:07:45.588
We'll see about that.

01:08:20.275 --> 01:08:22.145
Darkness makes you weak.

01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:49.912
Asha, Asha,
what's going on?

01:09:36.742 --> 01:09:39.658
Like I said, not good enough.

01:09:53.019 --> 01:09:55.848
Garan, Asha.

01:09:55.848 --> 01:09:56.980
She's gone.

01:10:12.648 --> 01:10:14.084
I'll see you again, Asha.

01:10:15.651 --> 01:10:16.695
Someday.

01:10:27.619 --> 01:10:29.795
You went down
the path of revenge

01:10:29.795 --> 01:10:32.015
thinking you were righteous.

01:10:32.015 --> 01:10:34.800
But you got lost, didn't you?

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.759
Too many debts owed
to the wrong people.

01:10:36.759 --> 01:10:40.371
You spilled a lot
of innocent blood
looking for me.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.156
Well, here I am,

01:10:45.332 --> 01:10:46.595
Mr. Ren.

01:10:50.686 --> 01:10:51.817
Drakos-san.

01:10:53.992 --> 01:10:55.256
We meet at last.

01:10:56.257 --> 01:11:00.217
Your tricks and illusions
will not work on me.

01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:03.655
Oh, you have
a very keen mind,

01:11:03.655 --> 01:11:07.137
just like your father, Sugahiro.

01:11:08.269 --> 01:11:10.053
Killed by your hand.

01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:18.235
I don't think you understand
the true nature
of the tetsu, right?

01:11:19.105 --> 01:11:20.585
You and I
are very much alike.

01:11:20.585 --> 01:11:22.544
We are nothing alike.

01:11:23.371 --> 01:11:25.503
You kill for sport.

01:11:25.503 --> 01:11:27.505
I work for the end.

01:11:27.505 --> 01:11:29.159
And yet, here you are!

01:11:31.073 --> 01:11:34.077
Accepting my invitation...

01:11:34.077 --> 01:11:35.687
...for sport.

01:11:35.687 --> 01:11:40.649
You have dishonored
the tetsuand yourself.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:47.569
And tell me, how much
did you honor cost?

01:11:50.876 --> 01:11:51.834
Ren.

01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:56.099
Ren!

01:11:57.796 --> 01:11:59.407
What's going on, Ren?

01:12:10.505 --> 01:12:11.593
Come on!

01:13:25.057 --> 01:13:26.015
Wait!

01:13:59.787 --> 01:14:02.138
Daddy,
I'm scared. I miss Mommy.

01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:04.923
-  Marcus?
- Daddy!

01:15:15.298 --> 01:15:16.473
Ren.

01:15:51.769 --> 01:15:53.597
Now, that was
a hell of a chess game.

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:59.081
This was never
a true chess game.

01:16:00.778 --> 01:16:02.606
You always
controlled the board.

01:16:02.606 --> 01:16:06.567
That's why you, me,
we're the last ones standing.

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:13.399
You know the origin
of the word "assassin,"
Mr. Garan?

01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:19.710
A thousand years ago,
an Arab sultan
employed hundreds of men

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:21.973
to do his clandestine bidding.

01:16:21.973 --> 01:16:23.105
Dirty work.

01:16:24.193 --> 01:16:28.371
To keep 'em loyal
and to trust them,
he fed them cakes of hashish.

01:16:31.113 --> 01:16:33.898
He told them the euphoria
that they were feeling,
the high,

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:37.119
was a little slice of heaven
that they would experience

01:16:37.119 --> 01:16:38.990
if they died in his service.

01:16:40.557 --> 01:16:42.385
They were called
the "Hashashins."

01:16:43.429 --> 01:16:45.823
Later, that evolved
to "assassin."

01:16:46.911 --> 01:16:48.608
Now, isn't that fascinating?

01:16:50.567 --> 01:16:52.221
I appreciate the history lesson.

01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:04.799
You should enjoy this moment.

01:17:07.018 --> 01:17:09.934
This is the last bit of euphoria
you'll ever feel.

01:17:14.635 --> 01:17:16.027
I knew it was gonna be you.

01:17:17.159 --> 01:17:19.509
I did. I always knew
you were the one

01:17:19.509 --> 01:17:21.424
who had the skills
to make it this far.

01:17:23.774 --> 01:17:24.992
I have a little confession too.

01:17:24.992 --> 01:17:26.689
There were a couple
of times where, uh,

01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:29.474
you got the assignments
and the contracts that I wanted.

01:17:31.042 --> 01:17:34.567
All this, all of this
'cause I beat you
out of a contract?

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:37.005
No. Of course not.

01:17:39.007 --> 01:17:41.139
But I do have an insatiable
desire to be the best.

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:43.185
Number one.

01:17:44.055 --> 01:17:45.927
My mother said
I was too competitive.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.236
But you see now, I have
the opportunity to prove
that to myself, don't I?

01:17:53.499 --> 01:17:54.849
I never wanted this.

01:17:56.024 --> 01:17:58.200
Never wanted to be
the world's best assassin,

01:17:59.027 --> 01:18:00.289
the King of Killers.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:02.944
What does that even mean?

01:18:05.686 --> 01:18:08.689
You know, it's like Asha said.

01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:11.822
Death is just part of life.

01:18:23.834 --> 01:18:24.835
So be it.

01:18:51.035 --> 01:18:52.602
Told you I was competitive.

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:50.442
Let's talk about
your wife for a moment.

01:19:50.442 --> 01:19:52.096
What was she doing
there that night?

01:19:52.096 --> 01:19:53.706
How didn't you see her early?

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:56.405
What could you
have done to save her?

01:19:56.405 --> 01:19:58.450
If only you hadn't hidden
all this from her.

01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:01.540
If you had told her the truth,
she might still be alive.

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:05.675
You carry the guilt
of that night
every second of every day.

01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:07.633
I know what it's like
to lose someone close to you,

01:20:07.633 --> 01:20:10.723
someone you can never get back,
how it could tear you.

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:12.551
Yet, you still come here.

01:20:12.551 --> 01:20:15.032
And you risk leaving
your daughter,
making her an orphan.

01:20:15.032 --> 01:20:17.599
Why? To try and save
the one you have left.

01:20:17.599 --> 01:20:19.210
But you have to kill me
to do that.

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:21.909
Before I kill you!

01:20:58.423 --> 01:20:59.860
The King does bleed.

01:22:04.489 --> 01:22:06.665
- Die!

01:22:14.412 --> 01:22:16.197
Looks like we have a victor.

01:22:21.724 --> 01:22:23.682
Congratulations, Mr. Garan.

01:22:27.555 --> 01:22:28.599
The King of Killers.

01:22:30.124 --> 01:22:32.126
I believe this is yours.

01:22:39.394 --> 01:22:40.525
What's this?

01:22:42.483 --> 01:22:43.832
It's your prize.

01:22:46.096 --> 01:22:51.101
That card will give you
access to a bank account
in the Caymans.

01:22:51.101 --> 01:22:52.798
There's ten million
dollars in it.

01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:55.845
You take care
of your daughter.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:04.941
I need your help.

01:23:09.554 --> 01:23:10.816
You need my help?

01:23:12.209 --> 01:23:14.168
There's an international
group of assassins

01:23:14.995 --> 01:23:18.171
that's ubiquitous and powerful.

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.001
They can destroy the world.

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:24.613
Creation of a new world order.

01:23:25.962 --> 01:23:27.703
That's why I killed
all these guys.

01:23:31.402 --> 01:23:32.969
And what I want is a partner.

01:23:34.318 --> 01:23:35.798
Help me bring 'em down,

01:23:37.321 --> 01:23:38.670
someone better than me.

01:23:40.671 --> 01:23:41.673
You.

01:23:43.501 --> 01:23:46.635
What I want is to be
with my daughter.

01:23:55.339 --> 01:23:58.037
There's a helicopter
that will take you
to the airport.

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.093
I'll be in touch.

01:24:38.207 --> 01:24:39.948
Isn't pizza the best?

01:24:39.948 --> 01:24:42.430
I know. It's really good.

01:24:43.213 --> 01:24:44.606
Can I have another milkshake?

01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:47.348
- You know what?
- What?

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:48.523
I have an idea.

01:24:48.523 --> 01:24:50.438
- What is it?
- How about we split one?

01:24:50.438 --> 01:24:53.223
-  That's a great idea.
- Right?

01:24:53.223 --> 01:24:54.876
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:25.995 --> 01:25:27.344
Hey, kiddo.

01:25:27.344 --> 01:25:28.650
Yeah?

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:30.521
Why don't you go play
your video games?

01:25:30.521 --> 01:25:33.220
- Okay.
- Daddy's got to talk
to someone.

01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.394
Okay, Dad.

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:47.103
-  Marcus?
-  Eight p.m.
at the Coal Train.

01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:49.497
I loved her like a sister.

01:26:06.992 --> 01:26:08.516
I told you you'd see me again.

01:26:11.519 --> 01:26:13.347
- This can't--
- It is.

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.437
Sorry you had to see that.
But it is real.

01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:20.092
Your best friend and mentor,

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:21.355
that's how diabolical
these people are.

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:31.626
- Where'd you get this?
- I have my sources.

01:26:33.323 --> 01:26:34.803
They cloned your phone.

01:26:34.803 --> 01:26:36.283
Sent your wife a text.

01:26:37.805 --> 01:26:39.721
That's what made her go
to the club that night.

01:26:45.161 --> 01:26:47.729
These people who recruited
your friend,

01:26:49.339 --> 01:26:51.298
they're the ones I told you
about six months ago.

01:26:52.777 --> 01:26:54.605
They call themselves
"Scimitar."

01:27:00.394 --> 01:27:01.438
Are you ready?

01:27:06.878 --> 01:27:08.706
I have to make
some arrangements first.

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.581
Then we go.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.457
Oh, and one more thing...
