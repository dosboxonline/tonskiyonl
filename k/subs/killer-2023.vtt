You won't mind if I have a drink.
A flight of whiskeys, please.

[Carl] My pleasure.

You won't find better, even in the city.

01:28:03.958 --> 01:28:08.583
You would be very impolite
to refuse to join in my <i>last </i>supper.

01:28:12.458 --> 01:28:13.750
Afraid it's tainted?

01:28:19.541 --> 01:28:24.208
I'm assuming you've also paid a visit
to a certain overadrenalized Floridian.

01:28:24.291 --> 01:28:25.333
No loss there.

You know, by the time you're finished,
they'd all be gone.

01:28:32.791 --> 01:28:33.791
[Carl] Cheers.

01:28:40.083 --> 01:28:41.750
You won't imbibe either?

For what it's worth,

01:28:55.333 --> 01:28:58.250
I would never have involved
your female friend.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.708
What happened to her, I had <i>no </i>part in.

01:29:01.291 --> 01:29:03.875
I objected to his methods,
and I told him so.

01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:05.958
But you've seen for yourself how…

01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:09.833
receptive… [chuckles softly]

01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:14.083
You… you get a name, you get an address.

01:29:14.166 --> 01:29:15.291
It's nothing personal.

01:29:15.375 --> 01:29:18.000
We've all had to work
through the occasional civilian

01:29:18.083 --> 01:29:20.458
who's stood between eyes and the prize.

01:29:29.458 --> 01:29:30.958

[coughs, sniffles]

01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:39.500
When I started,
I was surprised at what I was capable of.

01:29:40.916 --> 01:29:42.625
How easy it was.

01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:44.000
Shockingly.

01:29:45.166 --> 01:29:49.333
Yet, I assured myself
there were some things I would never do.

01:29:51.166 --> 01:29:52.708
Money was motivation.

01:29:53.625 --> 01:29:54.666
Which…

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.375
once there was enough,
could be used to buy another life.

01:29:59.458 --> 01:30:01.458
Another lie we told ourselves.

01:30:01.541 --> 01:30:06.166
When, for example, was the last time
you bothered to ask yourself

01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:09.500
why someone in your sights
was so thoroughly despised?

01:30:09.583 --> 01:30:11.000
<i>Less </i>you know, the better.

01:30:11.083 --> 01:30:13.000
"One man's cruelty
is another man's pragmatism."

01:30:13.083 --> 01:30:14.500
That old chestnut.

01:30:25.541 --> 01:30:27.541
A hunter goes into the woods,

01:30:27.625 --> 01:30:29.541
and he sees this grizzly.

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:31.541
Biggest he's ever seen.

01:30:33.666 --> 01:30:35.500
He raises his rifle, and he fires.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.708
The bear falls, the hunter rushes forward,

01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:40.500
and to his surprise,
there's nothing there.

01:30:40.583 --> 01:30:43.708
There's <i>no </i>bear,
there's <i>no </i>broken twigs, there's <i>no </i>blood.

01:30:44.375 --> 01:30:45.916
And then <i>suddenly,</i>

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.166
the grizzly throws this massive arm
around his shoulders and explains,

01:30:51.375 --> 01:30:52.333
"You took your shot."

01:30:52.958 --> 01:30:54.083
"You missed,

01:30:54.166 --> 01:30:56.500
so either I feast, or,

01:30:56.583 --> 01:30:58.708
and the choice is yours,

01:30:58.791 --> 01:31:00.083
I sodomize you."

01:31:01.375 --> 01:31:04.291
Naturally, the hunter chooses life.

01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:08.666
The next day,
the hunter returns to the woods

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:12.375
with a much bigger gun,
and he spots the bear again.

01:31:13.041 --> 01:31:16.208
And he aims. He fires. The bear falls.

01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:17.458
The hunter charges.

01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:20.541
No sign of the bear,
<i>until </i>the bear is standing beside him,

01:31:21.041 --> 01:31:23.375
saying, "You know the deal."

01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:25.875
Indignity ensues.

01:31:26.375 --> 01:31:29.125
The following day,
the hunter treks back to the wood.

01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:30.375
This time with a bazooka.

01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:34.125
He sees the bear,
lines him up in his crosshairs, fires.

01:31:34.208 --> 01:31:36.333
The recoil from the bazooka
throws him backwards.

01:31:36.416 --> 01:31:38.375
And he looks up as the smoke's clearing,

01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:41.750
and there's the bear standing above him,
arms crossed.

01:31:42.375 --> 01:31:43.791
And the bear squints.

01:31:46.875 --> 01:31:49.541
"You're not <i>really </i>out here
for the hunting, <i>are you?</i>"

01:31:49.625 --> 01:31:50.750
[he sighs]

01:31:55.666 --> 01:31:57.916
[swallows heavily, sighs]

01:31:58.583 --> 01:32:02.333
This could've been a hit-and-run,
carjacking, me falling on the ice.

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:04.375
And yet, <i>here </i>you are.

01:32:04.458 --> 01:32:05.875
[door squeaks open]

01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:07.541
[indistinct chatter in kitchen]

01:32:09.375 --> 01:32:12.666
If I screamed right now,
I'd still end up dead.

01:32:13.166 --> 01:32:14.458
You would make it out.

01:32:15.083 --> 01:32:16.208
<i>Most likely.</i>

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.541
But not <i>clean</i>, you wouldn't.

01:32:20.041 --> 01:32:21.625
Why take this risk?

01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:23.833
Desperate for conversation.

01:32:23.916 --> 01:32:25.750
I'm flattered, but no.

01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:30.083
You're here
because you couldn't help yourself.

01:32:31.291 --> 01:32:35.083
You expected to sit across from me
and feel nothing but reassured.

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:38.416
Like that recent day
when you shouldered your weapon

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.583
and somehow…

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:41.750
<i>missed.</i>

01:32:50.833 --> 01:32:53.000
- [bottle opens]
- How's it possible?

01:32:54.041 --> 01:32:57.375
Having prepared myself
for this moment for so long,

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.750
I have <i>failed </i>to believe
that it would ever arrive.

01:33:13.041 --> 01:33:14.458
[Carl] How are we?

01:33:15.125 --> 01:33:17.166
We're done. You can take everything.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:18.250
[Carl] Excellent.

01:33:28.583 --> 01:33:31.541
They wouldn't happen to have any ice cream
back there, would they, Carl?

01:33:31.625 --> 01:33:34.250
[Carl] Oh. Were you interested
in a dessert menu?

01:33:37.416 --> 01:33:39.500
No. No, it's all right.

01:33:42.625 --> 01:33:44.625
[water rushes]

01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:48.708

<i>Anticipate, don't improvise.</i>

01:33:53.583 --> 01:33:54.416
<i>Trust no--</i>

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.791
Are we there yet?

01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:57.083
A little further?

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.583
Far be it from me,
but maybe down by the river?

01:34:03.458 --> 01:34:04.583
Wow.

01:34:04.666 --> 01:34:07.583
Last minutes spent knowing
they're last minutes.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.500
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

01:34:11.916 --> 01:34:14.500
Who, come to think of it,
at this moment, is <i>you</i>.

01:34:15.833 --> 01:34:17.833
You'll remember our conversation.

01:34:18.875 --> 01:34:19.958
You will.

01:34:20.666 --> 01:34:22.416
When your time <i>does </i>arrive.

01:34:23.208 --> 01:34:26.583
It won't be your life flashing
before your eyes, it'll be mine.

01:34:28.041 --> 01:34:32.083
I suppose it'll be the closest
I can hope to come to haunting you.

01:34:46.416 --> 01:34:48.166
- [shoe heel breaks]

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:49.250
[sighs]

Help a girl out, won't you?

01:35:01.541 --> 01:35:03.500
<i>Trust no one.</i>

01:35:06.208 --> 01:35:08.000
<i>This is what it takes…</i>

01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:09.458
[bells chime]

[PA dings]

01:35:25.916 --> 01:35:27.583

Let me make that crystal clear.

01:47:21.208 --> 01:47:25.250
Right after the, uh… <i>incident</i>,
I received a phone call.

01:47:25.333 --> 01:47:28.750
I was told that things had gone sideways.

01:47:29.333 --> 01:47:32.041
My response was, "Nobody's perfect."

01:47:32.625 --> 01:47:37.166
Now, I did, <i>I admit</i>, inquire as to what
is normally done in these circumstances.

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:40.666
And they… he, <i>the lawyer fella</i>, Hedges,

01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:43.208
suggested that in this very rare case,

01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:47.458
I might wish to arrange for insurance
to prevent any <i>blowback</i>.

01:47:47.541 --> 01:47:48.791
I remember thinking,

01:47:48.875 --> 01:47:51.916
"Now, why in the world
is this liability mine?"

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.833
I mean, you have to please understand
this entire--

01:47:56.333 --> 01:47:58.541
I was very <i>new </i>to this kind of thing.

01:47:58.625 --> 01:48:02.666
I bled a little ink, so <i>yeah</i>.
Selfishly, I didn't want any blowback.

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:06.541
And so, eventually,
we agreed that for an <i>additional </i>150k

01:48:06.625 --> 01:48:08.500
the trail could be <i>scrubbed</i>.

01:48:08.583 --> 01:48:11.666
That was literally all I was told.
"Cleanup on aisle three."

01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:13.500
His words, not mine.

01:48:13.583 --> 01:48:16.458
And so, I made sure
there was enough in escrow

01:48:16.541 --> 01:48:18.375
and never thought about it again.

01:48:18.875 --> 01:48:19.791

and I can't express this strongly enough,

01:48:27.708 --> 01:48:30.291

01:48:30.375 --> 01:48:31.500
