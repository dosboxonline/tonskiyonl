THE JAPANESE INVASION LEFT
THE SOUTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON IN RUINS.

AND NOW ANOTHER STORM WAS LOOMING
IN THE NORTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON.

01:50.735 --> 01:54.405
THE JURCHENS ACROSS THE MANCHURIAN
PLAIN NORTH OF THE AMNOK RIVER

01:54.489 --> 01:58.409

ANOTHER GROUP OF THE JURCHENS

02:19.097 --> 02:22.892

THEY WERE JURCHENS LIVING IN JOSEON

SINCE THEY HAD LIVED IN JOSEON
FOR OVER A CENTURY,

02:30.817 --> 02:33.987

there's going to be another raid.

[male vendor 1] I suppose
the rumors you heard are true.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.806
What rumors?

09:18.849 --> 09:19.934
Well…
[sighs]

09:20.476 --> 09:24.021
I heard the Jurchen people went
to Pyesa-gun to get wild ginseng

09:24.105 --> 09:25.314
were all killed.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.483
-What?
-[sniffs]

09:27.567 --> 09:30.987
According to the army,
it's against the law to enter Pyesa-gun.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.656
I cannot believe
such a horrible thing happened there.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.201
I heard that
something scary lives in the woods.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.080
I heard none of those wild ginseng hunters
came back out alive.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.459
No one has been allowed to enter

13:02.406 --> 13:03.866

13:03.949 --> 13:06.368
How many times have I told you
not to go to Pyesa-gun?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.996
You told me that
it was actually dangerous.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.458
You told me yourself that
people spread the rumors

13:12.541 --> 13:15.544
so they could take all the wild ginseng
for themselves.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.546
That's why I told you not to go.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.217
What's more dangerous than a monster?
Are soldiers.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.676
Then what do we do?

13:23.677 --> 13:25.554
Are we just gonna let Mom die?

13:36.106 --> 13:39.109
They say the wild ginseng there,
it can even bring back the dead.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.278
-Why not Mom?
-You are not a ginseng hunter.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.491
How will you find the wild ginseng
in that huge mountain?

13:45.574 --> 13:48.786
I'm not sure if it was wild ginseng,
but I saw a strange plant.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.582
It was drawn on a mural that said
that it can bring back the dead.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.459
That's just nonsense.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.630
In those parts, there are no shrines left.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.216
-But I saw it, it was right--
-Stop talking nonsense.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.884
Listen to me and do not go there.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.721
Anybody who sneaked in there
and got caught,

14:08.305 --> 14:10.641
they were punished,
had their tongues cut out.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.853

Fifteen Pajeowi Jurchens
who went into Pyesa-gun

15:03.110 --> 15:05.946
crossing the river to hunt wild ginseng
were all found dead.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.742
They are the Pajeowi Jurchens?

15:10.451 --> 15:11.619
Are you sure, my lord?

15:13.662 --> 15:17.166
But who… who would do something like that?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.085
It was a tiger.

[suspenseful music]

15:22.671 --> 15:24.340
[Chi-rok]
You will have to cross the river.

Go spread the word that
all the Pajeowi Jurchens…

15:29.011 --> 15:30.304
were killed by a tiger.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.806
[suspenseful music continues]

15:36.894 --> 15:38.354
Understood, my lord.

15:42.232 --> 15:45.527
[Tahab] When will my village
receive a government position?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.363
An official one?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.241
We are very aware of your loyalty.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.370
Don't rush.
You must be patient and wait for it.

the limbs were torn by wild animals,

16:53.637 --> 16:55.681
but it happened after they died.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.558
It wasn't the tiger.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.103
They were killed by humans.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.647
I am aware of it.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.282
If 10,000 Jurchens come together…

[Chi-rok] While Joseon was floundering

18:11.256 --> 18:13.342
Aidagan, the head of the Pajeowi,

18:13.425 --> 18:16.011
has gathered the Jurchens under his wing.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.181
The Japanese in the south are
preparing to attack.

18:19.264 --> 18:24.311
If the Pajeowi in the north uses this
as an excuse to invade us as well,

18:24.394 --> 18:26.730
what will happen to this country?

18:26.814 --> 18:31.151
We can never let them know
those men were killed by our own people.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.405
They weren't attacked by people.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.951
They were attacked by a tiger.

So what brings you here at this hour?

19:21.451 --> 19:22.452
[door closes]

19:23.954 --> 19:27.624
The bodies of 15 dead Pajeowi Jurchens
were found in the pit.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.793
Are you certain there were 15 of them?

19:29.877 --> 19:30.752
Why?

19:31.587 --> 19:33.755
Are you saying that
I got the number wrong?

19:35.883 --> 19:38.802
[Chi-rok] I heard you went hunting
in the Birch Pass two days ago.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.263
[Beom-il scoffs]

19:43.849 --> 19:45.309
So tell me…

19:47.019 --> 19:49.730
since when do I need your permission
to go hunting?

19:49.813 --> 19:54.318
Every single Pajeowi Jurchen receives
martial arts training from an early age.

19:54.985 --> 19:58.322
With that straight in training,
it would be nearly impossible

19:58.405 --> 20:00.574
to take down 15 of them at once.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.911
Unless it was you
and your elite guards who did it.

[dramatic music]

20:16.840 --> 20:20.594

before someone else finds out.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.561
[bangs on table]

20:32.731 --> 20:34.650
Those Jurchen rats…

20:36.443 --> 20:39.613
they dared to steal
the Haewon Cho Clan's wild ginseng.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.657
They all deserved to die.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.535
You should have captured them
and punished them according to the law.

20:46.578 --> 20:50.916
That wild ginseng, does not belong
to the Haewon Cho Clan.

20:50.999 --> 20:54.419
It belongs to His Majesty,
the King of this country.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.798
-[sword clinks]
-[rattling]

20:59.925 --> 21:03.136
Do you think you can insult me
and my family like this

21:04.221 --> 21:06.056
just because I'm stuck…

21:07.224 --> 21:08.850
here in the boondocks?

21:08.934 --> 21:11.812
You abandoned your people
and fled during the war.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.563
That is why you're here.

21:13.647 --> 21:18.151
If you commit a crime
and endanger this country once again,

21:18.235 --> 21:20.988
you won't be able to avoid
the consequences.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.492
Even if you are from the Haewon Cho Clan.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.623
The people are growing anxious,

21:31.707 --> 21:35.544
so I will begin a tiger hunt
to calm their anxiety.

21:37.337 --> 21:41.466
You would do well to stay where you are
and keep out of trouble.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.843
[scoffs]

21:49.766 --> 21:52.519
I'm telling you, this is a warning.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.319

22:28.096 --> 22:31.058

22:39.691 --> 22:44.654
AMNOK RIVER, BORDER AREA

22:51.286 --> 22:54.331
BOUNDARY VILLAGE

22:56.041 --> 22:57.876
[Ashin] Are you sure it was a tiger?

22:57.959 --> 23:00.712
The Pajeowi learned martial arts
as soon as they can walk.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.674
They all got killed by one tiger?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.968
[grunts, inhales]

23:07.761 --> 23:11.056

23:18.230 --> 23:19.731
-[knife whooshes]
-[sighs]

23:24.277 --> 23:25.821
If it turns out to be a lie,

23:25.904 --> 23:28.281
no one will like it
when they find out the truth.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.118
It might put you in danger, Father.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.412
Being undercover…

23:35.372 --> 23:37.332
is always going to be dangerous.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.668
[inhales]

23:39.751 --> 23:43.255
While I'm gone,
it's your job to look after the family.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.799
[Tahab] All right, then.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.887
[panting]

23:50.971 --> 23:54.057
Father, let's go back to our clan
and cross the river.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.767
You let them take all your pelts

23:55.851 --> 23:58.520
and risk your life
to go undercover for them.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.274
Are you gonna let them walk
all over you forever?

24:06.486 --> 24:10.782
Pyesa-gun is where
our ancestors used to lived.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.284
[inhales]

24:12.367 --> 24:15.245
The King of Joseon bestowed the land
upon our clan,

24:15.328 --> 24:18.039
we were battling hunger and thieves
on the barren fields

24:18.123 --> 24:19.791
on the other side of the river.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.043
The King offered us a public office

24:22.752 --> 24:25.046
and exempted us from paying taxes.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.136
Joseon…

24:32.095 --> 24:34.139
he was very gracious to us.

24:34.764 --> 24:37.309
Hence, I cannot betray Joseon.
Do you understand?

24:43.940 --> 24:46.818
They may have been gracious
to our ancestors,

24:46.902 --> 24:49.529
but they've taken back everything
they gave us.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.284
Hang in there just a little longer.

24:54.367 --> 24:58.496
Soon, I will officially be appointed,
and we will live a good life.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.709

25:40.455 --> 25:41.790
Good.
[woman sighs]

25:43.083 --> 25:44.542
[exhales deeply]

25:46.836 --> 25:49.214
I think it's time we call for a doctor.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.758
No doctor would come here.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.261
There's no point.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.139
[woman] Then what do we do?

26:03.645 --> 26:05.480
Stay with Mom until I come back.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.735
[boy] Ashin! Please hurry!

26:12.445 --> 26:14.406
JURCHEN VILLAGE, NORTH OF AMNOK RIVER

26:14.489 --> 26:17.409
[Tahab] Far past the Amnok River
is Mount Baekdu,

26:17.951 --> 26:19.953
Joseon's highest mountain.

26:21.246 --> 26:26.543
It's so huge that you'll find
all kinds of trees and animals.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.963
The most famous beast
among the animals is…

26:30.547 --> 26:32.549
-the tiger.
-[crowd] Ooh…

26:32.632 --> 26:34.968
[all laugh]

26:36.803 --> 26:38.346
They say that

26:38.430 --> 26:41.641
this tiger is 1,000 years old.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.435
Sometimes,

26:43.518 --> 26:46.187
it even transforms into a human like us.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.523
[crowd derides]

26:50.358 --> 26:51.526
No, for real!

26:53.236 --> 26:56.156
Thousands of men have gone
into the mountains

26:56.239 --> 26:59.034
and met their death
trying to catch the tiger.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.120
-[indistinct chatter]
-[mocking laughter]

27:02.203 --> 27:05.081
Look, haven't you heard
of the Pajeowi Jurchens

27:05.707 --> 27:07.584
who climbed the Birch Pass recently?

27:08.501 --> 27:10.879
They all got eaten by that tiger.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.422
[crowd derides]

27:12.505 --> 27:14.799
-[Jurchen 1] Is that true?
-[Jurchen 2] No way.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.717
It is.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.803
I saw it with my own eyes.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.014
[sheepish laugh]

27:21.097 --> 27:23.808
Really?
[cackles]

27:28.480 --> 27:30.065
If you're lying to us…

27:34.027 --> 27:35.195
you will die.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.283

29:20.425 --> 29:23.094
THIS PLANT BRINGS THE DEAD
BACK TO LIFE…

29:23.178 --> 29:27.182
BUT YOU MUST PAY THE PRICE

-[clanking]
-[all clamoring]

29:38.568 --> 29:41.029
[Chi-rok] Our hunt will take place
in the Birch Pass.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.323
We will begin in these two areas.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.784
The Chupajin soldiers will spread out,

29:45.867 --> 29:48.077
guard the trails and go after them.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.329
We'll lure them out…

29:51.706 --> 29:52.540
to here.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.085
[soldier] You want to lure them out
to Pyesa-gun.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.756
Do not forget.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.674
We will only pretend to hunt them.

30:02.175 --> 30:05.428
[all clamoring]

30:06.554 --> 30:07.555
[leader] Quiet now!

30:08.306 --> 30:10.475
All right, when hunting a tiger,

30:10.558 --> 30:13.770
you shouldn't go too slow or too fast.

30:13.853 --> 30:14.896
If we are too fast,

30:14.979 --> 30:17.482
we might get attack by the tiger.

30:18.441 --> 30:21.319
-All right. Let's go!
-[hunters] Let's go!

30:21.402 --> 30:23.822
[leader] Let's go! Come on.

-[indistinct shouting]
-[gongs clanging]

30:38.795 --> 30:40.755
[soldier 1] That's a tiger's paw print
right there.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.137
This is very odd.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.892
Tigers hate the sound of gongs,
so it should be avoiding it,

30:52.976 --> 30:54.102
but it's not running away.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.437
What do you mean by that?

30:57.564 --> 30:59.274
[soldier 1] That it's coming toward us.

33:00.895 --> 33:03.982
It's a monster.
[grunts]

33:09.320 --> 33:11.072
Tell the hunters to fall back.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.449
We will take it from here.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.374

37:15.399 --> 37:17.068
[soldier 4] Here's what's really bizarre.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.737
We were told that
our brothers were killed by a tiger.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.908
Then where are their flesh and bones?

37:25.201 --> 37:26.827
They are the one who crossed the borders

37:26.911 --> 37:28.913
and entered Pyesa-gun,
which is against the law.

37:28.996 --> 37:32.875
There is no reason for us
to be held responsible for their deaths.

37:34.293 --> 37:36.545
Our brothers died on Joseon soil.

JOSEON MILITARY CAMP, CHUPAJIN

42:34.218 --> 42:37.137
[Chi-rok] I heard about
the tragic massacre at your village.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.848
Are you the only one who survived?

42:42.142 --> 42:44.770
What happened to your father, Tahab?

42:56.115 --> 42:57.783
I've heard that…

42:57.866 --> 42:59.618
[breathing shakily]

43:01.829 --> 43:04.790
the Pajeowi have executed a spy
from Joseon.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.003
Did you cross the river
and go all the way there?

43:10.671 --> 43:12.506
I don't understand what happened.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.467
[shaky breath]

43:16.844 --> 43:19.263
Why would the Pajeowi do this to us?

43:22.850 --> 43:26.061
I have been racking my brain
but I don't get it.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.899
Have you come to see me
to find out why it happened?

43:32.443 --> 43:33.444
No, sir.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.072
[sobbing]

43:37.156 --> 43:38.866
That doesn't matter to me at all.

43:42.536 --> 43:45.623
I beg you. Avenge my father.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.377
A lowborn weakling like me cannot do it.

43:52.046 --> 43:53.589
But Joseon can.

43:54.089 --> 43:56.342
You have the power to punish them.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.135
I'm sorry for your loss,

43:58.636 --> 44:02.139
but this is not a matter for Joseon
to intervene in.

44:02.222 --> 44:03.223
My father…

44:05.184 --> 44:07.436
was loyal to Joseon all his life.

44:12.566 --> 44:16.153
Although you never did the right thing
and gave him an official post…

44:17.905 --> 44:20.199
you could at least do this for him now.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.370
[Ashin] It, it doesn't have to be
right away.

44:24.912 --> 44:27.790
Next year or the following year…

44:28.999 --> 44:30.834
or even a decade from now.

44:35.798 --> 44:38.926
Please make them all shed tears of blood.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.639
Then I will make peace with it.

44:44.556 --> 44:46.058
I will do anything.

44:46.767 --> 44:49.144
I will be your loyal spy if you want,

44:49.228 --> 44:51.772
or even work as a butcher
if you tell me to.

44:54.566 --> 44:58.654
Even if it's something nastier,
I will gladly do anything.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.659
[shaky breath]

45:04.701 --> 45:08.455
Please avenge… the death of my father.

The peace conference with the Japanese
was called off?

53:18.486 --> 53:19.613
Yes.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.323
His Majesty has ordered every troop

53:21.406 --> 53:24.326
to assemble in the southern region
except those in Uiju and Kanggye.

53:34.628 --> 53:37.714
We will leave a few soldiers behind
and prepare for battle.

53:37.797 --> 53:38.757
Yes, sir.
