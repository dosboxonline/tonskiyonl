WEBVTT

01:27.771 --> 01:29.440
Hey.
Hey.

01:32.151 --> 01:33.527
Hey.
Hey.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.364
Hey.
Hey.

01:57.009 --> 01:58.177
Hmm?

02:00.346 --> 02:04.642
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

02:04.642 --> 02:05.935
It can't be.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.103
Tai Lung.

02:08.103 --> 02:10.856
I have returned to take what is mine.

02:10.856 --> 02:14.151
Which is everything that is yours.

02:22.201 --> 02:27.623
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

02:27.623 --> 02:30.793
and no one will stand in his way.

02:30.793 --> 02:34.797
Not even the great Dragon Warrior.

02:43.847 --> 02:45.766
Oh, where is Po?

02:45.766 --> 02:48.519
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

02:48.519 --> 02:51.522
Ping, will you please just relax?

02:51.522 --> 02:53.482
I am relaxed!

02:53.482 --> 02:56.193
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

02:56.193 --> 02:58.779
But what if he's sick? What if he's hurt?

02:58.779 --> 03:00.406
- What if he's hungry?

03:00.406 --> 03:02.157
Don't get your noodles in a twist.

03:02.157 --> 03:06.704
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

03:11.417 --> 03:14.211
Kung fu!

03:15.296 --> 03:17.506
Whoa! That's bad.

03:18.257 --> 03:20.384
Whoa! Getting worse.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.803
Whoa!

03:22.803 --> 03:25.639
Ah, come on!

03:42.448 --> 03:44.825
Ha-ha!

03:49.413 --> 03:52.541
Okay, big guy.
We're really gonna have to wrap this up.

04:05.596 --> 04:06.639
Whee!

04:07.556 --> 04:09.141
- Oink.
- Oink.

04:09.141 --> 04:10.226
- Again, again!

04:10.226 --> 04:12.144
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

04:12.144 --> 04:16.981
And next time,
keep your surf off their turf.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.990
I'm late. I'm late. Ooh, I'm late.

04:26.075 --> 04:28.410
The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

04:28.410 --> 04:31.038
Was, is and always will be.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.915
We love you, Dragon Warrior!

04:32.915 --> 04:34.542
And I love you too, adoring fan.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.126
Sign my scroll.
Sign my hat.

04:36.126 --> 04:37.294
- Sign my shirt.
Okay, okay.

04:37.294 --> 04:38.712
I'll sign whatever you want.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.589
Po!

04:41.590 --> 04:42.716
Master Shifu!

04:42.716 --> 04:44.343
Here, let me just--

04:45.052 --> 04:47.805
There, that's much... worse.

04:49.098 --> 04:50.140
We have to talk.

04:50.140 --> 04:53.018
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

04:53.018 --> 04:55.104
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

04:55.104 --> 04:56.397
What ceremony?

04:57.022 --> 04:58.858
The Staff of Wisdom.
Ooh.

04:58.858 --> 05:01.652
- Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
Aah.

05:01.652 --> 05:03.821
It is said that
whoever possesses this staff

05:03.821 --> 05:06.782
has the power
to travel between the realms.

05:06.782 --> 05:09.702
The power to unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm.

05:09.702 --> 05:12.121
And now, the power to open...

05:12.121 --> 05:16.917
the all-new
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

05:18.669 --> 05:23.048
Where the broth has kick
and the bean curd's a knockout.

05:27.219 --> 05:28.554
Dragon Warrior!

05:28.554 --> 05:30.681
Will the Furious Five be here too?

05:30.681 --> 05:32.057
Unfortunately, no.

05:32.057 --> 05:34.727
They're off on
super cool kung fu missions.

05:34.727 --> 05:37.188
Tigress is taking on
the free-range chicken gang.

05:37.188 --> 05:39.398
<i>Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.</i>

05:39.398 --> 05:41.233
<i>Crane was crowned
king of the Crocodilians.</i>

05:41.233 --> 05:42.610
Crane!
<i>Long story.</i>

05:42.610 --> 05:45.487
<i>Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.</i>

05:45.487 --> 05:46.447
<i>Or is it mongeese?</i>

05:46.447 --> 05:47.740
<i>And Mantis?</i>

05:47.740 --> 05:50.784
<i>Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.</i>

05:52.995 --> 05:54.413
Just 'cause they're not here in person

05:54.413 --> 05:57.082
doesn't mean they're not here
as life-sized cut-outs.

05:57.082 --> 06:00.169
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

06:00.169 --> 06:01.962
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

06:03.380 --> 06:04.632
My turn! My turn!

06:04.632 --> 06:05.716
And then you.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.557
He really captured
your disapproving scowl.

06:13.557 --> 06:14.767
We need to talk.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.436
- Now.

06:17.436 --> 06:19.522
Hey, can I get one of those
in a wallet size?

06:19.522 --> 06:20.856
Po!
- Coming.

06:22.942 --> 06:26.320
Do you remember the first time you climbed
these steps to the Jade Palace?

06:27.196 --> 06:30.115
How could I forget?
I thought I'd never make it to the top.

06:30.115 --> 06:31.617
Yes, but you persevered.

06:31.617 --> 06:35.871
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

06:35.871 --> 06:37.790
The next step?
What are you talking about?

06:37.790 --> 06:40.167
I've already taken all the steps.
Haven't I?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.962
It is time for you
to choose your successor.

06:42.962 --> 06:44.380
Successor for what?

06:44.380 --> 06:47.800
A successor to be
the next Dragon Warrior.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.760
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.179
Funny, 'cause I'm the Dragon Warrior.

06:55.558 --> 06:56.892
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

06:56.892 --> 06:59.645
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

06:59.645 --> 07:01.605
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

07:01.605 --> 07:03.274
Once a successor is chosen,

07:03.274 --> 07:06.402
you will advance
to the highest level in all of kung fu.

07:06.402 --> 07:09.488
Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Peace.

07:10.406 --> 07:11.866
Whoa.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.326
I don't know what that means.

07:14.326 --> 07:16.745
It's just like
Master Oogway before you.

07:16.745 --> 07:21.375
You will oversee the Valley,
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.627
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

07:23.627 --> 07:27.256
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

07:27.256 --> 07:30.175
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

07:30.175 --> 07:31.343
A cookie.

07:31.343 --> 07:32.636
Other hand.

07:32.636 --> 07:34.346
The Staff of Wisdom.

07:34.346 --> 07:36.348
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

07:36.348 --> 07:38.684
Do you really think it was so you could
open a restaurant?

07:38.684 --> 07:39.935
Or pose for pictures?

07:39.935 --> 07:41.687
He wasn't super specific.

07:41.687 --> 07:45.983
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

07:45.983 --> 07:48.944
and become something better
than you already are.

07:48.944 --> 07:50.196
You take it.

07:50.779 --> 07:52.823
No. Oogway did not give it to me.

07:52.823 --> 07:56.285
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,
which I have accepted

07:56.285 --> 07:57.578
and am at peace with.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.622
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

07:59.622 --> 08:02.249
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.417
This is an honor.

08:03.417 --> 08:07.546
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

08:07.546 --> 08:10.341
Master Shifu,
I finally found something I'm good at,

08:10.341 --> 08:12.134
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

08:12.134 --> 08:14.303
No one is taking anything away, Po.

08:14.303 --> 08:16.847
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

08:16.847 --> 08:19.600
Yeah, but where's the "skadoosh"?
You know what I mean?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.352
The "shasha-booie"?

08:21.352 --> 08:22.853
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

08:22.853 --> 08:25.523
but I don't know anything
about passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

08:25.523 --> 08:27.566
All I know are two things.

08:27.566 --> 08:30.903
Kicking butt and taking names.

08:30.903 --> 08:33.989
And if I'm being completely honest,
I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

08:33.989 --> 08:36.157
Like, who was
that fire-breathing crocodile?

08:36.157 --> 08:37.660
I wanna say Steve...

08:37.660 --> 08:39.994
You were chosen
to bring peace to the Valley,

08:39.994 --> 08:44.333
and there are other ways to bring peace
than simply kicking butt.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.502
Well, sure. But not any fun ones.

08:46.502 --> 08:49.838
Please. Being the Dragon Warrior
is all I know.

08:49.838 --> 08:52.007
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

08:52.007 --> 08:54.176
The Valley of Peace needs
a Spiritual Leader,

08:54.176 --> 08:56.053
and Master Oogway chose you.

08:56.053 --> 08:59.014
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

08:59.014 --> 09:01.517
Candidates? What candidates?

09:12.278 --> 09:13.737
Awesome!

09:21.036 --> 09:22.162
No way!

09:25.624 --> 09:26.834
Wow!

09:27.459 --> 09:28.878
Skadoosh.

09:28.878 --> 09:30.296
Fantastic pose.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.683
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

09:44.018 --> 09:49.190
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

09:51.108 --> 09:54.069
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

09:54.069 --> 09:58.073
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

09:58.866 --> 10:00.201
So many great candidates.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.204
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

10:04.163 --> 10:06.373
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.250
What is happening?

10:08.959 --> 10:11.587
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

10:17.384 --> 10:20.137
Like it or not, Po,
you have to choose a successor.

10:20.137 --> 10:24.099
Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

10:24.099 --> 10:25.809
You will know when you know.

10:25.809 --> 10:28.604
How do I know when I know?
You know?

10:29.647 --> 10:33.067
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

10:33.651 --> 10:35.319
Just as Oogway did before me.

10:35.319 --> 10:38.364
I'm not conflicted.
I'm just not ready for a next step.

10:38.364 --> 10:39.573
What is that you're holding?

10:39.573 --> 10:41.033
The Staff of Wisdom?

10:41.033 --> 10:42.117
Other hand.

10:42.117 --> 10:43.702
A chewed-up peach pit?

10:43.702 --> 10:45.162
Exactly.

10:45.162 --> 10:49.542
Every pit holds the promise
of a mighty tree.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.794
Uh, how is this gonna help me
find the answers?

10:51.794 --> 10:54.964
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

10:54.964 --> 10:57.633
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

11:00.719 --> 11:01.971
There we go.

11:01.971 --> 11:03.597
All right, universe.

11:04.723 --> 11:06.267
Give me some guidance.

11:07.977 --> 11:09.478
<i>Inner peace.</i>

11:10.354 --> 11:11.730
<i>Inner peace.</i>

11:12.356 --> 11:13.774
<i>Inner peace.</i>

11:14.275 --> 11:15.609
<i>Dinner, please.</i>

11:16.193 --> 11:17.653
<i>Dinner with peas.</i>

11:18.487 --> 11:19.822
<i>Snow peas?</i>

11:19.822 --> 11:22.074
<i>In a sesame soy glaze.</i>

11:23.200 --> 11:24.493
Inner peace.

11:25.202 --> 11:26.370
Inner peace.

11:28.706 --> 11:30.541
This is not working at all.

11:30.541 --> 11:32.209
Maybe focus on your breathing?

11:32.209 --> 11:34.962
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.798
Technically, you're talking to you,
if you think about it.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.551
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

11:40.551 --> 11:42.887
Wait, if I'm Po's inner voice,
then who are you?

11:42.887 --> 11:44.930
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

11:44.930 --> 11:46.515
How many voices do I have in there?

11:46.515 --> 11:48.684
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

11:48.684 --> 11:50.352
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

11:50.352 --> 11:53.189
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

11:55.858 --> 11:57.276
Anyone want a cookie?

12:03.741 --> 12:04.742
Universe?

12:07.286 --> 12:08.287
Is that you?

12:26.096 --> 12:28.140
Attention, mysterious figure!

12:28.724 --> 12:32.436
The Dragon Warrior's here
to perform justice.

12:36.065 --> 12:38.192
I know you're in here.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.819
Just a matter of time before I find you.

12:42.446 --> 12:43.447
Ooh.

12:52.248 --> 12:54.542
You can't hide from justice forever.

12:59.755 --> 13:02.049
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.009
You've got excellent taste,
I'll give you that.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.345
But I can't give you that.
Give it back.

13:06.345 --> 13:08.097
If you insist.

13:19.275 --> 13:21.235
- Oh, no!

13:21.235 --> 13:24.530
He's got a walking stick.
What are you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

13:24.530 --> 13:28.158
This stick is not for the strolling.
It's the Staff of Wisdom.

13:28.158 --> 13:30.828
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

13:30.828 --> 13:32.746
I am the Dragon Warrior.

13:33.873 --> 13:37.209
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about you
says "dragon" or "warrior."

13:46.927 --> 13:49.388
Whoa.

13:50.598 --> 13:52.016
Hi-yah!

13:52.975 --> 13:56.145
How dare you desecrate the Hall of Heroes?

13:56.145 --> 13:57.688
Who's desecrating what now?

13:57.688 --> 13:59.481
Master Ostrich's Egg!

13:59.481 --> 14:02.193
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

14:02.193 --> 14:04.570
The Indestructible Chain Hammer
of Master Pangolin.

14:04.570 --> 14:05.821
Whoopsies.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.327
Ha-ha! [grunts] Oh!

14:18.125 --> 14:20.044
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

14:20.044 --> 14:22.588
Which I've already broken! Twice!

14:23.839 --> 14:26.759
Why would you keep an urn of souls?
Feels kinda creepy.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.598
Are you doing okay there, big guy?
You're looking a little tired.

14:32.598 --> 14:34.475
- I've never felt more awake!

14:37.269 --> 14:39.021
The War Hammer of Master Chipmunk?

14:42.608 --> 14:43.943
You're gonna pay for that.

14:47.613 --> 14:48.572
Hello?

14:59.458 --> 15:00.626
You faker.

15:00.626 --> 15:02.711
It's not faking. It's called Method.

15:03.212 --> 15:05.005
Catch ya later, panda.

15:05.714 --> 15:06.840
No.

15:13.305 --> 15:15.057
I think I'll catch you now.

15:20.771 --> 15:21.856
Whoa!

15:28.612 --> 15:29.697
Whoa!

15:31.073 --> 15:32.116
Whoa!

15:35.744 --> 15:36.704
Told ya.

15:36.704 --> 15:39.832
You got me,
oh-great-and-powerful Dumpling Warrior.

15:39.832 --> 15:41.792
That's Dragon Warrior--

15:42.835 --> 15:44.336
Let go of me.

15:44.336 --> 15:45.671
Just tell me one thing.

15:45.671 --> 15:48.090
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

15:48.090 --> 15:50.384
That's a mystery for you to solve
during your two-year stay

15:50.384 --> 15:51.802
at the Valley of Peace prison.

15:51.802 --> 15:54.763
Valley of Peace prison?
Sounds like a day care.

15:54.763 --> 15:56.515
It is a day care on the weekends.

15:57.099 --> 15:58.726
But it's also a prison.

15:58.726 --> 15:59.935
There he is!

15:59.935 --> 16:00.978
Dragon Warrior!

16:00.978 --> 16:02.980
Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

16:02.980 --> 16:06.150
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

16:06.150 --> 16:08.736
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

16:08.736 --> 16:11.614
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

16:11.614 --> 16:13.949
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

16:13.949 --> 16:16.118
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

16:16.827 --> 16:20.164
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

16:20.164 --> 16:22.166
Well, you know what they say...

16:22.166 --> 16:27.004
every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

16:46.273 --> 16:51.195
Every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.619
Very clever, fox. You know something.

16:58.619 --> 17:00.788
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.165
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

17:03.165 --> 17:04.833
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

17:04.833 --> 17:06.043
I mean, what's in it for me?

17:06.043 --> 17:08.128
The peace of mind
knowing you did the right thing.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.673
You're adorable.
Has anyone ever told you that?

17:10.673 --> 17:12.466
And I don't mean just in, like,
the cuddly sense.

17:12.466 --> 17:13.759
I don't have time for games.

17:13.759 --> 17:15.928
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

17:15.928 --> 17:20.099
Maybe. Or maybe she wants you to think
it was Tai Lung.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.350
Wait. She?

17:21.350 --> 17:22.643
Mine!

17:23.477 --> 17:26.689
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

17:26.689 --> 17:27.981
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

17:27.981 --> 17:29.108
<i>The master of deception.</i>

17:29.108 --> 17:31.485
<i>The lizard of lies
with the glowing teal eyes.</i>

17:31.485 --> 17:32.695
<i>I'm talking 'bout...</i>

17:33.404 --> 17:35.447
The Chameleon.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.702
This is kind of a private conversation.

17:40.911 --> 17:42.454
Who's The Chameleon?

17:42.454 --> 17:44.832
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

17:44.832 --> 17:47.293
So she shape-shifted into Tai Lung.

17:47.793 --> 17:49.962
But what does she have against me
and the Valley of Peace?

17:49.962 --> 17:52.131
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

17:52.131 --> 17:56.051
You're right.
How do I find this "The Chameleon"?

17:56.051 --> 17:57.720
She isn't someone who can be found.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.514
At least not without someone in the know.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.392
And how do I find someone "in the know"?

18:03.392 --> 18:06.478
Oh! It's me.
It's obviously-- It's me.

18:06.478 --> 18:07.771
I'm in the know.

18:07.771 --> 18:10.316
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

18:10.941 --> 18:11.942
Good luck.

18:11.942 --> 18:15.112
After all, how hard can it be
to find someone who can look like anyone,

18:15.112 --> 18:16.405
blend in anywhere?

18:20.034 --> 18:22.369
Fine. You lead me to The Chameleon,

18:22.369 --> 18:24.747
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

18:24.747 --> 18:26.040
Deal.

18:27.124 --> 18:28.250
Po!

18:28.250 --> 18:29.543
What do you think you're doing?

18:29.543 --> 18:33.005
There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and--

18:33.005 --> 18:35.090
That's a job for the Furious Five.

18:35.090 --> 18:38.135
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

18:38.135 --> 18:40.012
Look, I know that change is difficult

18:40.012 --> 18:42.556
and that you enjoy
being the Dragon Warrior,

18:42.556 --> 18:45.017
but your job is finding a successor.

18:45.017 --> 18:48.479
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

18:48.479 --> 18:50.189
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

18:50.189 --> 18:51.440
I'm a red panda.

18:52.816 --> 18:54.568
You know what? I love that for you.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.195
Po, this is your decision.

18:56.195 --> 19:00.658
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.414
- Thanks for the free stay.
What are you doing?

19:07.414 --> 19:08.832
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

19:08.832 --> 19:10.376
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

19:10.376 --> 19:11.460
You can't leave.

19:11.460 --> 19:14.713
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

19:14.713 --> 19:17.925
You are supposed to be
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope!

19:17.925 --> 19:20.678
Just think of it as
one last Dragon Warrior adventure.

19:20.678 --> 19:23.055
I'll be back soon.
Tell my dads I love 'em.

19:23.055 --> 19:25.391
- I can't hear you anymore! Bye!

19:28.102 --> 19:31.438
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.107
That's a good back scratcher.

19:33.107 --> 19:34.441
- Yoink!
- Hey!

19:34.441 --> 19:36.694
So, does this really unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm?

19:36.694 --> 19:38.320
It doesn't work like that.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.115
It has to be given
in order to gain its powers.

19:41.115 --> 19:44.076
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

19:44.076 --> 19:45.828
No! What do you take me for?

19:45.828 --> 19:46.912
An easy mark.

19:46.912 --> 19:47.997
What's an easy mark?

19:47.997 --> 19:49.665
Someone who's easy to steal from,

19:49.665 --> 19:51.876
usually because they're generous
and too trusting.

19:51.876 --> 19:54.044
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

19:56.380 --> 20:00.759
I heard The Chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators,

20:00.759 --> 20:02.887
and her favorite food is panda.

20:02.887 --> 20:06.682
They say this Chameleon character
has magical powers.

20:06.682 --> 20:10.436
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

20:11.979 --> 20:15.900
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.401
Or you.

20:20.738 --> 20:22.990
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

20:22.990 --> 20:25.784
Po's going to
take down an evil sorceress?

20:25.784 --> 20:27.745
The-- The Chameleon?

20:27.745 --> 20:31.081
Well, a Dragon Warrior's work
is never done.

20:31.081 --> 20:34.335
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming up
with a convicted felon

20:34.335 --> 20:38.214
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

20:38.214 --> 20:43.177
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

20:43.177 --> 20:44.386
He's always come out on top.

20:44.386 --> 20:46.597
You're right. You're right.

20:46.597 --> 20:48.474
But what if you're wrong?

20:48.474 --> 20:50.226
Calm down, Ping.

20:50.226 --> 20:53.229
How bad can one evil sorceress be?

20:55.189 --> 20:57.650
Who is she to summon us?

20:57.650 --> 20:58.901
Classic power move.

20:58.901 --> 21:02.279
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

21:02.279 --> 21:05.908
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

21:05.908 --> 21:07.618
You left out the evil sorceress part.

21:07.618 --> 21:09.495
We used to run this city.

21:09.495 --> 21:12.081
Now we pay her half the money we swindle.

21:12.081 --> 21:14.667
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

21:14.667 --> 21:16.168
Yeah, but what could we do?

21:17.086 --> 21:19.380
Together, we can take her down.

21:19.380 --> 21:22.299
- Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

21:22.299 --> 21:26.303
She could be at this very table,
and we'd have no idea.

21:27.846 --> 21:30.182
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

21:30.182 --> 21:32.101
Or you're The Chameleon.

21:32.101 --> 21:33.853
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

21:33.853 --> 21:35.229
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

21:35.855 --> 21:37.523
...I'm The Chameleon.

21:37.523 --> 21:38.732
I said don't say it.

21:46.323 --> 21:48.158
We obviously spoke out of turn.

21:48.158 --> 21:49.243
Sorry, Chameleon.

21:49.243 --> 21:51.120
No, no. Don't apologize.

21:51.120 --> 21:55.624
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

21:55.624 --> 21:59.378
so it doesn't feel good
when you're the one being squeezed.

21:59.378 --> 22:02.047
Especially when the one
doing the squeezing

22:02.047 --> 22:05.551
is just a "bug-eyed, power-hungry"...

22:05.551 --> 22:07.136
What was the rest?

22:07.136 --> 22:09.054
Reptilian runt.

22:09.054 --> 22:13.225
Well, this "reptilian runt" wants more.

22:13.225 --> 22:15.269
You already have the city.

22:15.269 --> 22:17.229
What else could you possibly want?

22:17.229 --> 22:21.317
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

22:21.317 --> 22:24.111
As close as the blood moon.

22:24.111 --> 22:25.779
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

22:25.779 --> 22:28.407
So little time, so many expenses.

22:28.407 --> 22:33.829
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

22:33.829 --> 22:34.955
No.

22:39.877 --> 22:41.337
What was that now?

22:41.921 --> 22:44.423
I mean no disrespect.

22:46.175 --> 22:47.718
Don't worry.

22:47.718 --> 22:53.682
I forgive you for the impudence
and the backstabbing.

22:53.682 --> 22:59.104
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

22:59.688 --> 23:01.982
But I never forget.

23:01.982 --> 23:04.276
You might say I have the memory...

23:04.276 --> 23:05.486
Oh, don't say it.

23:05.486 --> 23:07.613
...of an elephant.

23:23.379 --> 23:26.632
You think
I've pushed you too far?

23:26.632 --> 23:30.803
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fathom

23:30.803 --> 23:34.640
just how far I can push.

23:40.646 --> 23:43.732
I'll expect your tributes by dawn.

23:47.528 --> 23:49.697
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

23:49.697 --> 23:51.782
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

23:51.782 --> 23:54.660
But it does take the occasional time-out
for snackage.

23:54.660 --> 23:56.453
Wanna split my almond cookie?

23:56.453 --> 24:00.040
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

24:00.040 --> 24:02.418
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

24:02.418 --> 24:03.377
The "bam-what-le"?

24:03.377 --> 24:05.421
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

24:05.421 --> 24:07.006
Do you want the cookie or not?

24:10.885 --> 24:12.469
I got my eye on you.

24:14.430 --> 24:16.974
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

24:16.974 --> 24:18.183
Just a little farther.

24:33.073 --> 24:36.619
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

24:36.619 --> 24:40.289
Well, I-- I-- I... didn't wanna miss
the blood moon rising.

24:40.289 --> 24:43.042
Oh, pooh.
You are just as worried as I am.

24:43.042 --> 24:44.460
All right, all right.

24:44.460 --> 24:47.296
I know pandas come across as
calm, gentle and chill,

24:47.296 --> 24:49.632
but... [chuckles] ...the truth is

24:49.632 --> 24:51.217
I'm kinda freaking out!

24:51.217 --> 24:52.259
So am I.

24:52.259 --> 24:56.555
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

24:56.555 --> 24:59.433
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured?

24:59.433 --> 25:01.352
Our baby!

25:02.478 --> 25:03.938
Okay, okay.

25:03.938 --> 25:06.190
Maybe Po has finally met his match,

25:06.190 --> 25:10.152
but there is still something that he has
that The Chameleon does not.

25:10.152 --> 25:12.279
- What's that?
- Us.

25:12.279 --> 25:15.199
Now, let's go find our son.

25:15.199 --> 25:16.408
I hope Po's okay.

25:16.408 --> 25:19.453
You know, Li,
a wise goose once said,

25:19.453 --> 25:22.498
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

25:22.498 --> 25:25.000
Who was that idiot?
Me, of course.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.544
I was the wise goose.

25:26.544 --> 25:28.295
Oh, yeah.

25:28.295 --> 25:30.214
Whoa.

25:30.214 --> 25:32.258
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

25:32.258 --> 25:34.051
That's no village.

25:34.051 --> 25:36.011
That's Juniper City.

25:36.011 --> 25:37.846
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

25:37.846 --> 25:39.390
Just a boat ride away.

25:39.390 --> 25:41.976
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

25:41.976 --> 25:43.936
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

25:43.936 --> 25:46.814
For the right price, those cutthroats will
take us anywhere we want to go.

25:47.398 --> 25:50.526
Of course, we could always opt for
the four-finger discount.

25:50.526 --> 25:51.819
No stealing.

25:52.695 --> 25:54.321
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

25:54.321 --> 25:56.198
Well, that sounds inviting.

26:01.203 --> 26:03.122
Anybody lose a rabbit?

26:09.336 --> 26:10.629
Stir faster!

26:12.965 --> 26:16.135
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

26:16.135 --> 26:18.971
I'll find us a ride.
Maybe you can get us some food.

26:19.513 --> 26:20.931
And stay out of trouble.

26:23.142 --> 26:24.560
Hey, what you guys playing?

26:24.560 --> 26:26.312
Mah-jongg.

26:26.312 --> 26:27.980
And the stakes are high.

26:27.980 --> 26:29.064
Can I play?

26:29.064 --> 26:32.484
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,
'cause I'm very beginning.

26:34.153 --> 26:36.363
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

26:36.363 --> 26:38.240
A boat ride to Juniper City.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.325
Ask this guy.

26:41.869 --> 26:43.871
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

26:43.871 --> 26:45.414
- Thanks.

26:48.542 --> 26:51.337
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

26:51.337 --> 26:53.214
Never played before, huh?

26:53.214 --> 26:55.216
I'm sorry, are you accusing me
of cheating?

26:55.216 --> 26:57.509
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

26:57.509 --> 26:59.511
I am the manager.

27:00.054 --> 27:04.225
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper City,
but I won't carry anything illegal.

27:04.225 --> 27:05.601
I don't want any trouble.

27:05.601 --> 27:07.561
Trouble runs from me.

27:07.561 --> 27:09.021
Then it'll cost you double.

27:09.021 --> 27:11.565
I'm confused.
Should I have said that I like trouble?

27:11.565 --> 27:13.400
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.070
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go back
to the double price?

27:19.073 --> 27:20.491
You got a deal.

27:20.491 --> 27:23.452
Great.
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

27:24.370 --> 27:25.871
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

27:25.871 --> 27:27.331
Yes. Everything, again.

27:27.331 --> 27:29.375
Except for the broth. It was very bland.

27:29.375 --> 27:30.960
- Keep stirring!

27:32.461 --> 27:35.130
Whoa! One of everything is my go-to order.

27:35.923 --> 27:37.174
But how did you pay for this?

27:37.174 --> 27:39.134
Legally. Lawfully. Fair and square.

27:39.134 --> 27:40.594
- I'm proud of you.

27:51.605 --> 27:52.690
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

27:52.690 --> 27:55.609
Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

27:55.609 --> 28:00.114
Did you actually think you could
grift a meal out of me?

28:00.114 --> 28:03.158
There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

28:05.119 --> 28:07.580
And apparently,
I'm the one misunderstanding.

28:07.580 --> 28:10.708
Please allow us to pay for our meal
and yours too.

28:10.708 --> 28:12.710
I'm only hungry for...

28:12.710 --> 28:14.169
- Dumplings?
- ...vengeance!

28:14.169 --> 28:16.130
Well, then, come and get it.

28:16.130 --> 28:18.132
No! No, no, no! Don't come and get it!

28:18.132 --> 28:20.175
- Destroy them!

28:32.855 --> 28:33.898
I got it!

28:44.283 --> 28:45.409
There you go.

28:47.286 --> 28:48.829
- All better.

28:48.829 --> 28:51.582
- Come on! Gotcha.

28:51.582 --> 28:52.833
Keep stirring!

29:01.300 --> 29:02.718
Oh, yeah!

29:21.737 --> 29:22.988
I'll take that.

29:26.075 --> 29:27.368
Think this belongs to you.

29:40.339 --> 29:41.840
No stealing!

29:46.387 --> 29:49.098
Yeah, I think it's
a little too late for that.

29:49.098 --> 29:51.392
It's never too late to do the right thing.

29:51.392 --> 29:53.018
- Get them!

29:53.018 --> 29:54.770
Watch out!
- Whoa!

30:02.111 --> 30:03.988
- Skadoosh!

30:10.494 --> 30:14.206
- Whoa. Nice move. You gotta teach me that.

30:14.206 --> 30:16.333
You die, panda!

30:29.597 --> 30:30.806
Ah! Uh.

30:31.348 --> 30:33.309
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:35.269 --> 30:37.396
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

30:37.396 --> 30:40.107
I shouldn't have eaten
all those dumplings.

30:41.150 --> 30:42.693
- Huh?

30:42.693 --> 30:43.944
Uh-oh.

30:48.616 --> 30:49.909
Sail ho!

30:56.498 --> 30:59.418
Back up! Move, move, move!

31:02.713 --> 31:04.757
- Not that I'm worried, but...

31:04.757 --> 31:07.176
...what if The Chameleon knows
we're coming?

31:07.176 --> 31:09.386
Why, she could be anywhere, anyone.

31:09.386 --> 31:12.264
Li, would you please show
a little backbone?

31:12.264 --> 31:15.768
I'm sorry, but bravery was never
really my specialty.

31:15.768 --> 31:20.564
You don't have to be brave.
You just have to act brave.

31:20.564 --> 31:22.733
Act brave? Got it.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.402
- Ah!
- Oh!

31:25.402 --> 31:26.820
Oh, Li!

31:26.820 --> 31:29.198
- Hold on!

31:29.198 --> 31:32.034
Hold me, Ping! It's all been for nothing!

31:32.034 --> 31:33.536
Please, no.

31:33.536 --> 31:35.955
- I'm too young!

31:39.542 --> 31:41.252
How was that for acting brave?

31:41.252 --> 31:43.170
Keep working on it.

31:47.216 --> 31:49.426
Juniper City.

31:49.426 --> 31:51.345
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

31:51.345 --> 31:53.347
Does your family live there too?

31:53.347 --> 31:55.683
They would. If I had a family.

31:56.350 --> 31:58.853
It wasn't easy being a little fox
in a big city.

31:59.770 --> 32:02.022
<i>So I had to survive any way I could.</i>

32:02.022 --> 32:03.065
Hey!

32:03.065 --> 32:06.193
<i>Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.</i>

32:06.193 --> 32:08.821
Stop running! Stop running!

32:14.535 --> 32:16.912
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

32:16.912 --> 32:18.372
Well, I mean I was.

32:18.372 --> 32:22.293
My goose dad adopted me,
and then later, my panda dad found me.

32:22.293 --> 32:26.005
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

32:26.005 --> 32:27.548
- Right, Mom?

32:28.299 --> 32:30.426
Then, one day, a local took me in.

32:30.426 --> 32:33.888
Put a roof over my head,
gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

32:33.888 --> 32:36.265
After that, I was never alone again.

32:36.265 --> 32:37.474
I guess we both got lucky.

32:37.474 --> 32:38.517
I guess.

32:38.517 --> 32:40.895
Hey, tell me something.
Back in the Valley of Geese...

32:40.895 --> 32:41.937
Peace.

32:41.937 --> 32:43.439
...what did that angry little squirrel
mean...

32:43.439 --> 32:44.356
Red panda.

32:44.356 --> 32:46.400
...when he said you had to
find your successor?

32:47.568 --> 32:49.987
Now that I'm supposed to become
Spiritual Leader,

32:49.987 --> 32:53.073
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

32:53.073 --> 32:55.242
Once you're on top,
that's where you wanna stay, right?

32:55.242 --> 32:58.329
No, it's just that-- What do I know
about being a Spiritual Leader?

32:58.329 --> 33:00.873
I can't even come up with
one of those cool-sounding proverbs.

33:00.873 --> 33:03.542
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

33:03.542 --> 33:05.753
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

33:06.337 --> 33:07.463
Okay.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.840
Everyone knows
life's greatest enemy is time.

33:10.799 --> 33:13.886
I guess it's just easier to hold on
to the life you know

33:13.886 --> 33:15.387
than move on to the one you don't.

33:15.387 --> 33:17.181
Hey, that was pretty good.

33:17.181 --> 33:18.098
Yeah.

33:18.098 --> 33:21.936
Maybe she should be the Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Geese.

33:23.854 --> 33:25.898
Whoa, that guy.
He drinks like a fish.

33:25.898 --> 33:27.441
Should he be driving?

33:52.466 --> 33:55.594
We've come to pay tribute,
as you requested.

33:55.594 --> 33:57.471
Looks a little light.

33:57.471 --> 33:59.348
Go back out and get me more!

33:59.348 --> 34:00.266
More?

34:00.266 --> 34:01.433
But-- But, Chameleon--

34:01.433 --> 34:05.062
Go! Before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

34:07.898 --> 34:11.193
At last, my destiny approaches.

34:14.905 --> 34:20.410
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

34:20.410 --> 34:24.039
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond!

34:28.419 --> 34:33.339
They will all know the name
of The Chameleon!

34:33.339 --> 34:34.675
<i>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

34:34.675 --> 34:38.888
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

34:38.888 --> 34:41.932
She's gonna take over cities and towns
and the Valley of Peace.

34:41.932 --> 34:43.642
A vision?

34:43.642 --> 34:45.185
While you were asleep?

34:45.185 --> 34:46.604
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

34:46.604 --> 34:48.397
Not a dream, a vision.

34:48.397 --> 34:50.482
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

34:50.482 --> 34:52.318
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

34:52.318 --> 34:54.320
We got to get to The Chameleon
and take her down.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.280
Well, then you're in luck.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.449
Welcome to Juniper City.

35:03.662 --> 35:05.080
Whoa!

35:07.541 --> 35:10.377
This is the place where you can be
whatever you wanna be,

35:10.377 --> 35:12.671
do whatever you wanna do,

35:12.671 --> 35:15.966
and steal whatever you wanna steal.

35:15.966 --> 35:17.051
Uh, if that's your thing.

35:17.051 --> 35:20.679
Land ho!

35:21.931 --> 35:23.891
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

35:34.318 --> 35:35.194
Ah!

35:36.403 --> 35:37.571
- Whoa!
- Move!

35:37.571 --> 35:39.323
- Look out!
- Sorry!

35:39.323 --> 35:40.407
Out of the way!

35:41.242 --> 35:43.202
I've never seen so much traffic before.

35:43.202 --> 35:45.287
You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

35:45.287 --> 35:47.581
No one's ever in that much of a rush. Oof.

35:49.250 --> 35:50.626
Come on!

35:55.256 --> 35:57.174
Well, sure is good to be home again.

35:57.174 --> 35:59.009
The sights. The sounds.

35:59.009 --> 36:01.720
The smells.

36:05.933 --> 36:09.562
It's a wonton wonderland!

36:11.689 --> 36:12.731
Yeah!

36:16.026 --> 36:17.653
Po. Po!

36:17.653 --> 36:19.154
Focus!

36:19.154 --> 36:21.240
This city is the most amazing place
I've ever seen!

36:21.240 --> 36:24.618
I used to feel the same way
until The Chameleon got her claws into it.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.007
Tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

36:38.007 --> 36:39.133
Oh, yeah.

36:39.133 --> 36:42.803
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

36:42.803 --> 36:45.848
Is she lurking in that villainous tower
dominating the city?

36:47.641 --> 36:48.642
How'd you know?

36:48.642 --> 36:50.644
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

36:50.644 --> 36:51.729
Let's keep moving.

36:51.729 --> 36:53.147
Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

36:53.147 --> 36:54.315
Long time no see.

36:54.315 --> 36:55.232
How you doing, Zhen?

36:55.232 --> 36:57.484
Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

36:57.484 --> 37:00.738
Yeah, well, let's just say
a face like mine is hard to forget.

37:03.449 --> 37:05.576
What? You're a wanted criminal?

37:05.576 --> 37:09.163
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

37:09.163 --> 37:11.165
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

37:11.165 --> 37:12.499
Don't worry.

37:12.499 --> 37:14.710
The law has better things to do
than look for me.

37:14.710 --> 37:17.338
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

37:17.338 --> 37:18.464
Must be a slow workweek.

37:18.464 --> 37:19.715
I'll handle this.

37:19.715 --> 37:22.885
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

37:22.885 --> 37:26.347
The fox and I are here
on official Dragon Warrior biz.

37:26.347 --> 37:27.973
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

37:27.973 --> 37:29.433
Dragon Warrior.

37:29.433 --> 37:31.727
Anyone? Nothing?

37:31.727 --> 37:33.729
Perhaps you know me better as...

37:34.396 --> 37:36.857
the Kung Fu Panda!

37:38.025 --> 37:39.902
- Wait, wait!

37:39.902 --> 37:41.779
Can you believe that guy?

37:41.779 --> 37:42.947
Aw, come on!

37:42.947 --> 37:46.242
Okay, so we tried it your way.
Now we try it mine.

37:47.868 --> 37:52.665
- Wait, what's your way--

37:52.665 --> 37:53.749
Sorry.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.835
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

37:57.461 --> 38:00.047
You can't run away from the law.
You're a wanted criminal!

38:00.047 --> 38:02.758
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

38:02.758 --> 38:05.052
Wow. City life really is fast-paced.

38:05.052 --> 38:07.012
We gotta get out of here
before they call for...

38:09.265 --> 38:10.558
...backup.

38:15.312 --> 38:16.730
That's a lot of bull.

38:16.730 --> 38:18.274
- Run!

38:24.989 --> 38:26.866
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

38:35.916 --> 38:37.209
Ow!

39:04.820 --> 39:05.821
Let's go.

39:07.323 --> 39:09.533
Whoa! Whoa!

39:12.077 --> 39:13.746
I'm falling...

39:13.746 --> 39:15.581
very slowly.

39:17.291 --> 39:19.668
Ow!

39:31.096 --> 39:32.348
Sorry.

39:48.697 --> 39:49.657
Whew.

39:57.122 --> 39:58.123
There they are!

39:59.959 --> 40:02.211
We don't have time for a drum solo!

40:03.837 --> 40:05.256
We're trapped.

40:17.601 --> 40:18.686
It isn't much farther now.

40:18.686 --> 40:21.355
You always say that,
and it's always so much farther.

40:23.649 --> 40:26.485
Whoa. What is this place?

40:26.485 --> 40:27.945
Home sweet home.

40:27.945 --> 40:31.532
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

40:33.659 --> 40:37.079
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

40:40.457 --> 40:41.792
Uh-oh.

40:41.792 --> 40:44.044
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

40:48.674 --> 40:49.758
Ooh!

40:55.055 --> 40:56.181
Ow!

41:00.561 --> 41:03.480
Oh!

41:03.480 --> 41:05.733
So you're friends
with all these people?

41:05.733 --> 41:07.026
They're practically family.

41:07.026 --> 41:08.360
Zhen!

41:13.490 --> 41:15.701
Oh! Is that really you?

41:15.701 --> 41:18.162
Han, my old mentor.

41:18.162 --> 41:21.123
I always knew someday you'll find your way
home back to the den.

41:21.123 --> 41:22.583
And when you did...

41:24.168 --> 41:27.213
...I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

41:27.213 --> 41:28.547
Family, huh?

41:28.547 --> 41:29.882
More like distant cousins.

41:29.882 --> 41:31.800
All right. How should we do this?

41:31.800 --> 41:34.970
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

41:34.970 --> 41:38.390
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

41:38.390 --> 41:41.143
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

41:41.143 --> 41:42.686
- Hooray!
- Yay!

41:42.686 --> 41:44.271
You really don't wanna do this.

41:44.271 --> 41:45.356
And why is that?

41:45.356 --> 41:47.608
Because if you so much as
lay one claw on me,

41:47.608 --> 41:49.276
you're gonna have to answer to...

41:49.985 --> 41:51.987
the Dragon Warrior.

41:51.987 --> 41:54.615
Warrior, warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior.

41:55.908 --> 41:56.909
Who?

41:59.328 --> 42:02.623
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

42:02.623 --> 42:04.041
Introduce them, Po,

42:04.959 --> 42:07.127
to your fists.

42:12.174 --> 42:16.387
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

42:16.387 --> 42:18.389
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

42:18.389 --> 42:20.266
Yes, now.

42:20.266 --> 42:23.602
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner Shifus
have differing opinions?

42:23.602 --> 42:24.979
We are in total agreement...

42:24.979 --> 42:26.981
...with our mutual disappointment...

42:26.981 --> 42:28.148
...in you.

42:29.984 --> 42:30.985
Wait.

42:32.236 --> 42:35.656
He who resorts to violence now...

42:36.866 --> 42:40.202
will only find more violence later.

42:40.202 --> 42:41.161
Huh?

42:42.663 --> 42:46.709
So what you're saying is,
if we don't hurt Zhen a little now...

42:46.709 --> 42:48.669
We can hurt her a lot later.

42:48.669 --> 42:50.504
What? No, that's not what I said.

42:50.504 --> 42:54.550
Yes! And more violence later
is better than less violence now.

42:54.550 --> 42:56.927
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of--

42:56.927 --> 42:58.345
- More violence!
- Hooray!

42:58.345 --> 43:00.931
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

43:00.931 --> 43:03.058
You know, that panda
makes a lot of good points.

43:03.058 --> 43:06.687
- I like it.
Violence, violence, violence.

43:06.687 --> 43:07.897
No, no, no! Wait!

43:07.897 --> 43:08.981
Come back!

43:08.981 --> 43:10.941
I'll come up with better wisdom.

43:11.734 --> 43:13.903
You have got to workshop
those proverbs.

43:15.613 --> 43:17.948
Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

43:17.948 --> 43:19.783
The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

43:19.783 --> 43:21.702
Those are both very common names.

43:21.702 --> 43:23.495
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

43:23.495 --> 43:25.164
Trained by Master Shifu?

43:25.164 --> 43:27.374
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

43:27.374 --> 43:29.835
Everyone's heard of
the legendary Master Shifu.

43:29.835 --> 43:30.878
But not you.

43:31.879 --> 43:34.340
Did someone say "legendary"?
Bring it in.

43:36.717 --> 43:37.718
Look, Han.

43:37.718 --> 43:40.721
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

43:40.721 --> 43:42.431
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

43:42.431 --> 43:44.266
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

43:46.227 --> 43:49.730
Oh!

43:49.730 --> 43:52.858
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

43:52.858 --> 43:54.401
And why should I help you?

43:54.401 --> 43:57.071
Because deep down
beneath that iron-scaled exterior

43:57.071 --> 43:58.572
is a good-hearted soul

43:58.572 --> 44:00.491
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

44:01.534 --> 44:02.660
Fine.

44:02.660 --> 44:06.205
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

44:06.914 --> 44:07.873
Sleep tight.

44:12.294 --> 44:14.213
So tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

44:14.213 --> 44:15.798
After you get your pants back.

44:16.674 --> 44:18.384
Not cool! You guys--

44:18.384 --> 44:20.010
Come on! Give them back.

44:20.010 --> 44:21.428
Those are custom.

44:27.768 --> 44:31.146
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

44:31.981 --> 44:34.358
Oh! Oh, my tail.

44:35.276 --> 44:37.528
I'm sure everything is fine.

44:37.528 --> 44:38.988
This is a restaurant.

44:38.988 --> 44:41.991
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

44:41.991 --> 44:43.242
You wait here.

44:45.369 --> 44:47.121
Salutations!

44:47.121 --> 44:49.707
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

44:49.707 --> 44:51.166
I know you're having a good time,

44:51.166 --> 44:55.838
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

44:56.422 --> 44:57.882
There was a panda here.

44:58.549 --> 44:59.633
You know him?

44:59.633 --> 45:02.428
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

45:05.097 --> 45:06.724
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

45:07.349 --> 45:10.936
You need to pay
for what your son did to my tavern.

45:15.107 --> 45:18.235
My boy wouldn't have done this
for no reason.

45:18.235 --> 45:20.196
Is it possible your broth was bland?

45:20.196 --> 45:21.572
Try it.

45:22.072 --> 45:24.325
No, no!

45:24.325 --> 45:26.327
The broth smells excellent.

45:26.327 --> 45:30.080
You should not add a single thing,
especially not me!

45:30.080 --> 45:31.624
Hands off the goose.

45:35.294 --> 45:36.629
The panda's back.

45:36.629 --> 45:38.088
- He's back?
- He's back?

45:38.088 --> 45:39.173
No.

45:39.840 --> 45:42.927
But you're about to wish he was,

45:42.927 --> 45:45.387
'cause if you think he made a mess
of this place,

45:45.387 --> 45:48.349
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

45:48.349 --> 45:51.310
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

45:53.812 --> 45:55.523
Except one thing.

45:56.106 --> 45:57.066
Mercy.

45:58.275 --> 46:01.779
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

46:03.113 --> 46:06.617
Now, this can go one of two ways.

46:06.617 --> 46:10.996
The easy way,
in which you tell me where he is,

46:10.996 --> 46:12.081
or the hard way,

46:12.081 --> 46:14.833
in which you tell me where he is,

46:14.833 --> 46:16.794
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

46:16.794 --> 46:18.170
because you have no teeth.

46:25.427 --> 46:26.845
Mah-jongg.

46:26.845 --> 46:29.932
I eat mah-jongg tiles for breakfast!

46:57.459 --> 46:58.669
Huh?

47:10.764 --> 47:11.765
Stay there!

47:11.765 --> 47:12.808
Where's our son?

47:12.808 --> 47:14.685
He took a boat to Juniper City.

47:14.685 --> 47:15.853
Which way?

47:17.062 --> 47:19.106
You know, a wise goose once--

47:19.106 --> 47:20.399
Time to go.

47:20.399 --> 47:21.734
Uh, yeah. Right.

47:52.348 --> 47:54.099
Okay, let's try this again.

47:54.099 --> 47:58.854
Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

47:59.980 --> 48:02.691
Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

48:02.691 --> 48:04.527
Not gonna happen with a broom.

48:04.527 --> 48:05.694
Yeah? Still not bad though.

48:05.694 --> 48:11.033
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

48:11.033 --> 48:12.493
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

48:12.493 --> 48:14.662
- And "ska-blam" is?

48:19.542 --> 48:20.626
Ska-blam!

48:26.173 --> 48:29.760
I gotta say, you're not
like any of the other masters I've met.

48:29.760 --> 48:31.887
Yeah, I know.
There's not a lot of pandas.

48:31.887 --> 48:34.807
No, you're, like, a good guy.

48:34.807 --> 48:37.226
Listen up. The coast is clear.

48:37.226 --> 48:39.687
Thieves, hit the streets.

48:39.687 --> 48:41.021
And you two,

48:41.021 --> 48:42.690
get out of my sight.

48:54.326 --> 48:55.494
Huh?

49:03.377 --> 49:06.297
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

49:06.297 --> 49:09.049
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

49:09.049 --> 49:13.387
I gotta say, Zhen,
you really are a fox of your word.

49:13.387 --> 49:15.514
A chewed-up peach pit?

49:15.514 --> 49:18.475
One from Master Oogway's peach tree
of heavenly wisdom.

49:19.602 --> 49:21.854
Eh, it's a Valley of Peace thing.

49:21.854 --> 49:26.108
It's supposed to remind me that every pit
holds the promise of a mighty tree.

49:28.360 --> 49:30.112
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

49:36.410 --> 49:37.703
Are you sure you wanna do this?

49:37.703 --> 49:40.581
As a wise Spiritual Leader once said,

49:40.581 --> 49:45.628
how may one kick butt,
if one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

49:48.005 --> 49:49.882
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

49:49.882 --> 49:51.133
Thank you.

49:51.133 --> 49:53.761
Wait, was that a compliment or an insult?

49:53.761 --> 49:54.887
Yes.

50:03.521 --> 50:04.480
Whoa.

50:07.525 --> 50:09.068
Have you seen our son?

50:16.075 --> 50:17.201
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

50:17.201 --> 50:18.494
- Nope.
- Nah.

50:18.494 --> 50:20.454
Tell us you've seen our son.

50:23.082 --> 50:25.376
Wait, why are they leaving? You said yes.

50:26.210 --> 50:29.004
Hey, look. Po was here.

50:29.004 --> 50:31.465
Amazing, Li, but how can you tell?

50:31.465 --> 50:34.510
Oh, we pandas have a gift
for seeing what others cannot.

50:34.510 --> 50:36.929
Come on. There may be more clues up ahead.

51:11.755 --> 51:13.340
Why?

52:06.352 --> 52:07.686
That was close.

52:07.686 --> 52:09.063
Look out!

52:09.063 --> 52:10.314
Huh?

52:12.358 --> 52:14.193
- Po!
- Stand back.

52:16.779 --> 52:18.322
- Whoa!

52:19.865 --> 52:22.284
- They're coming!
- Hurry! Help me lift the cage!

52:29.041 --> 52:30.125
It's no use.

52:30.125 --> 52:33.045
- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

52:33.045 --> 52:35.214
All right, stand back. Here I go.

52:37.341 --> 52:38.384
Zhen?

52:40.427 --> 52:42.179
Where are you taking my staff?

52:44.056 --> 52:46.892
I think you mean my staff?

52:46.892 --> 52:50.729
You gave it to Zhen,
and now Zhen has given it to me.

52:50.729 --> 52:53.941
"Given to gain,"
I believe, is how it works?

52:53.941 --> 52:55.568
You were right, Zhen.

52:55.568 --> 52:56.986
He was an easy mark.

52:56.986 --> 52:58.362
Zhen...

52:58.362 --> 53:01.532
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

53:01.532 --> 53:03.534
I taught her that.

53:03.534 --> 53:06.245
And you thought my apprentice
was your friend?

53:06.245 --> 53:07.496
Apprentice?

53:07.496 --> 53:09.415
She's the one that took you in?

53:09.415 --> 53:11.834
Best thing that ever happened to her.

53:11.834 --> 53:15.212
You should have seen
the little guttersnipe before I found her.

53:15.212 --> 53:17.298
<i>Mangy and half-starved,</i>

53:18.716 --> 53:21.802
<i>hanging out with those rejects
from the Den of Thieves.</i>

53:43.282 --> 53:44.950
<i>She had no fear.</i>

53:46.285 --> 53:47.745
<i>Such potential.</i>

53:54.418 --> 53:56.045
So I took her in.

53:57.630 --> 53:59.924
I made her what she is today.

53:59.924 --> 54:01.508
Stand up straight.

54:01.508 --> 54:02.676
Yes, master.

54:02.676 --> 54:06.347
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

54:06.347 --> 54:07.431
Why?

54:07.431 --> 54:13.312
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

54:13.854 --> 54:15.356
I wanted respect and power.

54:15.356 --> 54:18.108
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

54:18.108 --> 54:19.193
Say what?

54:19.193 --> 54:22.780
I was turned away
from every training hall I went to.

54:22.780 --> 54:26.867
They would say I was too small, too lowly,

54:26.867 --> 54:30.079
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

54:30.079 --> 54:33.332
And so, I chose a different path.

54:33.332 --> 54:35.084
Sorcery.

54:35.084 --> 54:36.335
I grew.

54:37.294 --> 54:38.629
I excelled.

54:38.629 --> 54:42.466
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

54:42.466 --> 54:45.427
- Everything except kung fu.

54:45.427 --> 54:49.640
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

54:50.766 --> 54:54.895
You see, Po, kung fu may be
performed by the body,

54:54.895 --> 54:57.982
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

54:57.982 --> 55:00.609
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm--

55:00.609 --> 55:02.820
You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

55:02.820 --> 55:06.407
His and those of every master villain
that came before me.

55:06.407 --> 55:11.328
And once I do, no one will dare
underestimate me again.

55:11.328 --> 55:13.372
You forgot about me.

55:16.125 --> 55:18.168
Don't bother, Po.

55:18.168 --> 55:23.340
Those bars are enchanted with
some very old and very powerful magic.

55:23.340 --> 55:27.303
You'd need at least ten Dragon Warriors
to get through them.

55:27.303 --> 55:28.846
Then I won't go through them.

55:28.846 --> 55:30.973
I'll go under them.

55:45.487 --> 55:47.907
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

55:56.332 --> 55:57.666
Whoa!

56:25.236 --> 56:27.196
- Po!
- Zhen?

56:27.947 --> 56:29.323
My staff! Hand it over.

56:29.323 --> 56:32.326
I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I was just doing what I was told.

56:32.326 --> 56:34.662
Apologize later.
Right now, I have to stop The Chameleon.

56:34.662 --> 56:36.413
Po!

56:36.413 --> 56:37.748
Zhen?

56:42.878 --> 56:44.380
No!

56:50.469 --> 56:52.221
Well done, Zhen.

56:52.221 --> 56:54.431
You never said you were gonna hurt him.

56:54.431 --> 56:56.642
What's the second rule
of the streets?

56:57.601 --> 56:59.228
Someone always gets hurt.

56:59.228 --> 57:01.313
And make sure it's never you.

57:02.147 --> 57:05.109
I just wish there had been another way.

57:05.109 --> 57:06.819
Third rule of the streets?

57:07.319 --> 57:08.571
Third rule?

57:08.571 --> 57:11.198
Some would say
it's the most important:

57:11.198 --> 57:14.827
No one is interested in your feelings.

57:16.579 --> 57:19.081
Chop-chop!
We have a Spirit Realm to plunder.

57:20.165 --> 57:22.001
And smile.

57:22.001 --> 57:24.211
Nobody likes a grouch.

57:24.211 --> 57:27.840
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know where
you pick up such bad habits.

57:35.556 --> 57:36.557
If I could--

57:40.436 --> 57:41.395
Hey there.

57:42.188 --> 57:43.731
Whoa!

57:45.316 --> 57:47.776
Get off me! Ow! Ow!

57:52.990 --> 57:54.366
Son!

58:02.166 --> 58:04.585
- Now save me.

58:05.920 --> 58:06.921
Hi, Son.

58:10.716 --> 58:13.344
It's okay. We've got you, Po.
We've got you.

58:15.721 --> 58:17.097
So you followed me.

58:17.097 --> 58:18.474
- It was his idea.

58:18.474 --> 58:20.434
Okay, okay. It was both our ideas.

58:20.434 --> 58:22.603
We only follow because we love.

58:22.603 --> 58:25.564
No, you followed
because you didn't believe in me.

58:26.774 --> 58:27.900
And because we love?

58:29.068 --> 58:31.070
Well, you're right.

58:31.695 --> 58:33.531
I screwed up big-time.

58:34.406 --> 58:36.242
I trusted the wrong person.

58:36.242 --> 58:38.827
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

58:40.496 --> 58:41.497
Oh...

58:42.206 --> 58:46.835
Po, that was a very big-time screw-up.

58:49.672 --> 58:53.217
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

58:53.217 --> 58:56.804
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

58:56.804 --> 58:59.765
I was just so determined
to keep things the way they were.

58:59.765 --> 59:02.935
Everyone is afraid of change, Po.

59:02.935 --> 59:04.562
Even me.

59:04.562 --> 59:07.439
There was a time not so long ago

59:07.439 --> 59:12.361
when all I wanted to be was
the greatest noodle chef in the valley.

59:12.361 --> 59:13.821
So what happened?

59:14.405 --> 59:16.907
I became the greatest noodle chef
in the valley.

59:16.907 --> 59:18.033
It's true.

59:18.033 --> 59:20.077
But I also became a father.

59:20.786 --> 59:23.914
And nothing...
nothing's ever been the same since.

59:25.040 --> 59:27.376
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

59:27.376 --> 59:30.963
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

59:32.590 --> 59:35.134
Because if things stayed the same forever,

59:35.134 --> 59:38.012
sooner or later,
they would lose their flavor.

59:39.638 --> 59:40.764
He's right, Po.

59:40.764 --> 59:44.059
Since I left my village,
I've become a bit of a warrior.

59:44.059 --> 59:45.978
- Strong. Brave.

59:47.396 --> 59:49.231
Move it.

59:49.231 --> 59:50.316
This way.

59:50.983 --> 59:53.652
Get those cages up there. Come on.

59:54.486 --> 59:56.572
Hmm. This looks bad.

59:56.572 --> 59:57.698
Really bad.

59:57.698 --> 59:58.782
Move it.

59:58.782 --> 01:00:00.701
Come on.

01:00:05.998 --> 01:00:10.169
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

01:00:10.169 --> 01:00:12.796
What? No. It's-It's just--

01:00:12.796 --> 01:00:16.550
When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:19.803
That's all that panda was,
something to use.

01:00:21.472 --> 01:00:26.185
Is that why you took me in?
So I could help you get what you wanted?

01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:27.603
Zhen.

01:00:27.603 --> 01:00:32.066
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

01:00:32.066 --> 01:00:33.150
like me.

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.528
And the day you stop being those things

01:00:35.528 --> 01:00:39.907
is the day when, yes,
you stop being useful to me.

01:00:39.907 --> 01:00:43.494
So for both of our sakes,
don't change.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:55.631
Tonight, when the blood moon rises
to its highest point in the night sky,

01:00:55.631 --> 01:01:01.554
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,
and all of its secrets will be mine!

01:01:07.768 --> 01:01:10.062
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

01:01:12.147 --> 01:01:14.567
I seem to remember it rising faster.

01:01:16.277 --> 01:01:17.570
No?

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:18.654
Just me?

01:01:19.822 --> 01:01:20.823
Hmm.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.118
Ugh.

01:01:24.118 --> 01:01:26.287
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

01:01:26.287 --> 01:01:29.248
I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

01:01:41.218 --> 01:01:42.887
Bring me Tai Lung!

01:01:53.147 --> 01:01:54.148
Tai Lung.

01:01:55.232 --> 01:01:56.233
Big fan.

01:01:56.233 --> 01:01:59.111
Who are you,
and what are you doing with that staff?

01:01:59.111 --> 01:02:02.239
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

01:02:02.239 --> 01:02:03.741
The puffy panda?

01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:05.201
Po might be an idiot,

01:02:05.201 --> 01:02:09.163
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

01:02:09.163 --> 01:02:11.540
Who said anything about willingly?

01:02:20.424 --> 01:02:24.803
Hmm. Apparently I misjudged you, lizard.

01:02:24.803 --> 01:02:27.306
Now, why have you brought me back?

01:02:27.306 --> 01:02:29.475
I summoned you here
so that you could teach me

01:02:29.475 --> 01:02:31.560
your most legendary kung fu moves.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.688
I don't share my skills with anyone.

01:02:34.688 --> 01:02:36.398
It wasn't a request.

01:03:27.449 --> 01:03:29.451
Yes, I got it!

01:03:29.451 --> 01:03:31.537
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

01:03:31.537 --> 01:03:33.706
The power, the precision.

01:03:37.376 --> 01:03:39.587
What have you done to me?

01:03:39.587 --> 01:03:43.173
All of your kung fu is now mine.

01:03:44.091 --> 01:03:48.554
And the best part is,
I'm just getting warmed up.

01:03:48.554 --> 01:03:50.931
Bring me General Kai.

01:03:53.517 --> 01:03:57.271
Bring me Master Osprey.

01:03:59.315 --> 01:04:01.525
Master Bull.

01:04:08.199 --> 01:04:09.283
Po, wait!

01:04:09.283 --> 01:04:11.577
Please be reasonable.

01:04:11.577 --> 01:04:13.787
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my staff back.

01:04:13.787 --> 01:04:15.873
No staff is worth your life.

01:04:15.873 --> 01:04:18.292
As long as I'm still the Dragon Warrior,

01:04:18.292 --> 01:04:20.920
I won't let anyone else get hurt
because of me.

01:04:37.853 --> 01:04:38.812
Po!

01:04:39.772 --> 01:04:40.898
You're alive!

01:04:43.859 --> 01:04:46.028
Please. I made a mistake.

01:04:46.028 --> 01:04:48.906
So did I. Trusting you.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:50.449
I'm sorry.

01:04:51.033 --> 01:04:52.868
Did your master tell you
to say that too?

01:04:52.868 --> 01:04:56.080
She's not my master.
I'm leaving, for good.

01:04:56.914 --> 01:04:58.207
It's the truth.

01:04:58.207 --> 01:05:00.292
I was wrong about everything.

01:05:01.585 --> 01:05:04.004
- What are you doing?

01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:05.631
Stopping you.

01:05:05.631 --> 01:05:07.508
Get out of my way, Zhen.

01:05:07.508 --> 01:05:08.759
No.

01:05:09.552 --> 01:05:10.469
Move.

01:05:10.469 --> 01:05:12.221
You want me to move?

01:05:12.221 --> 01:05:13.514
Move me.

01:05:13.514 --> 01:05:16.100
First you betray me,
and now you wanna fight me?

01:05:17.226 --> 01:05:18.686
- Why are you doing this?

01:05:18.686 --> 01:05:21.689
To stop you from getting killed.

01:05:49.717 --> 01:05:51.886
What do you care
if I get killed or not?

01:06:07.735 --> 01:06:09.361
Please, Po.

01:06:09.361 --> 01:06:11.572
Just let me do one thing right.

01:06:16.744 --> 01:06:19.580
You're not the only one
who's made some bad choices lately.

01:06:21.582 --> 01:06:23.709
You're really gonna
go through with this, aren't you?

01:06:23.709 --> 01:06:24.835
'Fraid so.

01:06:24.835 --> 01:06:27.755
And there's nothing I can do
to talk you out of it?

01:06:27.755 --> 01:06:28.923
I'm afraid not.

01:06:28.923 --> 01:06:30.925
You can't beat her, you know.

01:06:30.925 --> 01:06:32.509
You're probably right.

01:06:33.969 --> 01:06:35.387
But I have to try.

01:06:37.014 --> 01:06:38.974
Get as far away from this place
as you can.

01:06:38.974 --> 01:06:40.059
Po!

01:06:40.059 --> 01:06:42.269
We should never have
let him come here.

01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:44.522
We are such terrible fathers.

01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:46.440
At least you didn't lie and betray him.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.859
Well, that's true.
You're worse.

01:06:48.859 --> 01:06:50.778
I am a terrible friend.

01:06:50.778 --> 01:06:53.489
"Friend"?
That feels a little generous, no?

01:06:53.489 --> 01:06:55.699
Uh, l-let's just give up.
Surrender.

01:06:55.699 --> 01:06:57.368
We can't let him go in there alone.

01:06:57.368 --> 01:06:58.953
What can we do?

01:06:58.953 --> 01:07:01.413
There are just three of us
against an army.

01:07:01.413 --> 01:07:04.208
Then I guess we'll just have to
get an army of our own.

01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:19.098
Hey! Listen up, everybody!

01:07:22.893 --> 01:07:25.521
Quack!

01:07:27.898 --> 01:07:29.149
Thank you.

01:07:29.149 --> 01:07:31.235
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:34.238
- Who?
- You know, Po.

01:07:35.698 --> 01:07:36.866
The panda.

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.996
No, no. A different panda.

01:07:41.996 --> 01:07:44.206
- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

01:07:44.957 --> 01:07:46.125
Okay, that doesn't matter.

01:07:46.125 --> 01:07:49.795
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

01:07:49.795 --> 01:07:51.755
So, I need yours.

01:07:51.755 --> 01:07:53.591
Why should we help you?

01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:54.925
Because--

01:07:54.925 --> 01:07:56.010
Because...

01:07:56.886 --> 01:07:58.429
it's the right thing to do.

01:08:02.766 --> 01:08:04.727
Stop it. Stop.

01:08:04.727 --> 01:08:06.061
Stop laughing.

01:08:07.354 --> 01:08:09.690
Look, I know you think
it might be too late

01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:14.445
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

01:08:14.445 --> 01:08:19.532
but a good friend once told me
it's never too late to do the right thing.

01:08:19.532 --> 01:08:23.077
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

01:08:23.077 --> 01:08:25.121
the more wrong we can do later.

01:08:25.121 --> 01:08:26.331
- What? No.

01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:28.876
And with The Chameleon out of the way...

01:08:28.876 --> 01:08:31.086
We can finally do all the wrong we want.

01:08:31.086 --> 01:08:33.130
I-I think you're missing
the fundamental point.

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:35.758
Violence, violence, violence.

01:08:35.758 --> 01:08:39.595
Are you guys ready to do the right thing
for the wrong reasons?

01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:47.186
Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

01:08:47.186 --> 01:08:48.979
was underestimating his opponent.

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:51.941
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

01:08:51.941 --> 01:08:53.442
Hey.

01:08:56.028 --> 01:08:58.697
Now, you see, the mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made was that--

01:08:58.697 --> 01:09:00.366
Shut up, Larry.

01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:07.414
This place is crawling
with more guards than I've ever seen.

01:09:07.414 --> 01:09:09.500
I'm never gonna get to Po in time.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.294
You just get to Po.
We'll take care of the guards.

01:09:12.294 --> 01:09:13.671
We will?

01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:15.171
I-I mean, we will.

01:09:15.171 --> 01:09:16.382
But how?

01:09:16.882 --> 01:09:18.550
Just leave that to me.

01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:51.250
General Kai?

01:09:52.001 --> 01:09:53.251
Lord Shen?

01:09:53.251 --> 01:09:57.214
Those are all my old nemesis-es.
Nemes-ee. Nemes-i?

01:09:57.214 --> 01:10:00.259
The Chameleon is pulling spirits
from the Spirit Realm

01:10:00.259 --> 01:10:02.303
and draining us of all our moves.

01:10:02.303 --> 01:10:05.139
And she's using your staff to do it.

01:10:05.139 --> 01:10:07.141
- I'm here to get it back.

01:10:07.141 --> 01:10:08.642
I won't hold my breath.

01:10:08.642 --> 01:10:10.186
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

01:10:10.186 --> 01:10:11.979
Do you know me? It's Scott.

01:10:13.772 --> 01:10:15.733
The fire-breathing crocodile?

01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:18.819
Oh, right! Scott!

01:10:18.819 --> 01:10:21.113
Master Shifu and I
were just talking about you.

01:10:21.113 --> 01:10:22.573
Panda.

01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:26.952
Oogway made a mistake
choosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

01:10:28.078 --> 01:10:32.208
I just didn't realize
how big a mistake it was until now.

01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:34.752
Whoa. Tai Lung?

01:10:34.752 --> 01:10:38.297
I'm gonna get that staff back,
restore your kung fu,

01:10:38.297 --> 01:10:40.758
and return you all
back to the Spirit Realm.

01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:42.092
You'll see.

01:10:42.092 --> 01:10:43.427
All I see

01:10:44.261 --> 01:10:46.180
is a broken promise.

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:55.814
All right, you bunch of
cantankerous Komodos.

01:10:55.814 --> 01:10:59.109
Now, this can go one of two ways.

01:10:59.109 --> 01:11:02.905
The easy way,
in which you surrender willingly,

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:07.034
or the hard way,
where you surrender woundedly.

01:11:07.034 --> 01:11:09.828
The choice is yours.

01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:16.085
- I was kidding! I was kidding!

01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:26.011
Aw.

01:11:28.222 --> 01:11:29.765
- Ow! Ow!

01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:33.102
Thanks, Ping.

01:11:37.439 --> 01:11:38.566
Run away!

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.656
Cannonball!

01:11:54.123 --> 01:11:55.332
- Oh, is it too spicy?

01:11:55.332 --> 01:11:58.085
Mmm. No. It's got the perfect kick.

01:11:58.085 --> 01:12:01.338
Ginseng. That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

01:12:08.304 --> 01:12:11.557
That panda was right.
More violence later is better!

01:12:12.182 --> 01:12:13.517
Yay!

01:12:19.481 --> 01:12:22.067
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

01:12:25.446 --> 01:12:27.615
Can't you even die right?

01:12:27.615 --> 01:12:29.575
Can't you even kill wrong?

01:12:29.575 --> 01:12:31.911
No.
Wordplay didn't come together.

01:12:31.911 --> 01:12:33.245
Now, about that staff...

01:12:35.623 --> 01:12:36.624
Take it.

01:12:36.624 --> 01:12:39.293
I already have everything I need
from it anyway.

01:12:39.877 --> 01:12:42.087
I think this was destiny.

01:12:42.087 --> 01:12:46.592
A final face-off
between formidable adversaries,

01:12:46.592 --> 01:12:49.428
alike in so many ways.

01:12:49.428 --> 01:12:51.055
If only I had a dumpling for every time

01:12:51.055 --> 01:12:52.973
a villain told me
how much we had in common.

01:12:52.973 --> 01:12:54.058
It's true.

01:12:54.058 --> 01:12:56.393
We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

01:12:56.393 --> 01:12:59.522
It's a shame only one of us can
come out on top.

01:12:59.522 --> 01:13:02.149
It is a shame, for you.

01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:07.112
My combined powers of sorcery and kung fu
make me unstoppable.

01:13:07.112 --> 01:13:11.575
And once I dispense with you,
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to--

01:13:11.575 --> 01:13:13.369
Every other city and town and village

01:13:13.369 --> 01:13:15.120
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.330
Yeah, I know.

01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:18.415
But how did you know?

01:13:18.415 --> 01:13:22.378
I saw it in a vision
because I'm the Dragon Warrior...

01:13:24.547 --> 01:13:25.881
for now at least.

01:13:25.881 --> 01:13:29.468
But I've realized
that it's probably time I made a change.

01:13:30.553 --> 01:13:31.971
And so should you.

01:13:31.971 --> 01:13:34.848
I'm The Chameleon.
I do nothing but change.

01:13:34.848 --> 01:13:36.684
Only on the outside.

01:13:36.684 --> 01:13:39.436
Real change happens from within.

01:13:39.436 --> 01:13:41.897
And if we're really as alike as you say,

01:13:41.897 --> 01:13:43.941
then maybe we could both let go
of who we were

01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:46.360
and become something better
than we already are.

01:13:47.152 --> 01:13:49.655
- What do you say?
- I say...

01:13:52.241 --> 01:13:53.742
Well, I saw that coming.

01:13:56.036 --> 01:13:57.746
We're very proud of you.

01:13:57.746 --> 01:13:58.956
You tried it our way.

01:13:58.956 --> 01:14:01.083
Now try it yours.

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:03.335
Kick her butt.

01:14:03.335 --> 01:14:05.254
I'm way ahead of you.

01:14:13.304 --> 01:14:15.472
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist.

01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:20.769
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror.

01:14:21.854 --> 01:14:23.856
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury.

01:14:28.903 --> 01:14:30.863
Master Bull's Horns of Doom.

01:14:33.282 --> 01:14:34.491
What?

01:14:34.491 --> 01:14:35.826
Recognize this move?

01:14:38.454 --> 01:14:41.165
Is that how I sound?
I don't sound like that, do I?

01:14:41.165 --> 01:14:44.418
You didn't earn those skills.
You just stole them!

01:14:45.502 --> 01:14:47.087
Give him a left, a right, uppercut.

01:14:47.087 --> 01:14:50.674
- Which one are you rooting for?
- I'm not sure. This is all very confusing.

01:14:50.674 --> 01:14:53.427
I'm stronger than every opponent
you've ever faced,

01:14:53.427 --> 01:14:56.847
because I am every opponent
you've ever faced.

01:14:56.847 --> 01:14:57.765
Po!

01:15:10.402 --> 01:15:13.197
Whoa. I gotta workshop
those heroic entrances.

01:15:13.197 --> 01:15:15.491
Nah, it was just right.

01:15:17.326 --> 01:15:20.663
I knew I should have left you
to rot in the gutter where you belong.

01:15:20.663 --> 01:15:23.290
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

01:15:31.382 --> 01:15:33.300
- Two against one?

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.511
Well, now, that doesn't seem fair.

01:15:35.511 --> 01:15:37.680
I'll have to even the odds.

01:15:38.889 --> 01:15:40.558
Master Cobra.

01:15:41.225 --> 01:15:43.310
Master Osprey.

01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:45.354
Master Scorpion.

01:15:45.354 --> 01:15:47.398
Master Wolf.

01:15:47.398 --> 01:15:49.859
General Kai.

01:15:49.859 --> 01:15:51.151
Lord Shen.

01:15:55.364 --> 01:15:58.409
That is awesome!

01:15:59.535 --> 01:16:01.537
I mean, it's disturbing, but it's awesome.

01:16:18.929 --> 01:16:19.763
Whoa!

01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:22.182
Zhen!

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:36.614
No!

01:16:43.037 --> 01:16:44.288
Whoa, whoa!

01:16:56.842 --> 01:16:58.093
Po!

01:17:04.934 --> 01:17:06.602
I thought we were friends.

01:17:08.479 --> 01:17:09.563
Stand back.

01:17:09.563 --> 01:17:11.899
I'm gonna kick my butt.

01:18:34.648 --> 01:18:35.941
Come on, Po, get out of there.

01:18:35.941 --> 01:18:38.402
- You have to do this.
- I can't beat The Chameleon.

01:18:38.402 --> 01:18:40.029
A wise, old tortoise once told me

01:18:40.029 --> 01:18:42.281
that you never know what you can do
until you do it.

01:18:42.281 --> 01:18:44.450
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:47.036
and you're here giving me life advice
from a tortoise?

01:18:47.036 --> 01:18:48.621
Be the pit, Zhen.

01:18:49.246 --> 01:18:50.956
Be the pit.

01:19:00.716 --> 01:19:02.384
And what do you think you're doing?

01:19:02.384 --> 01:19:04.136
Finishing what Po started.

01:19:04.136 --> 01:19:07.014
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

01:19:09.016 --> 01:19:10.434
Don't slouch.

01:19:20.444 --> 01:19:22.738
You ungrateful little urchin.

01:19:22.738 --> 01:19:26.909
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda?

01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:31.664
First rule
of the streets: Never trust anyone.

01:19:31.664 --> 01:19:35.084
Ha! You can't defeat me.
I know all your moves.

01:19:35.084 --> 01:19:36.669
Not this one.

01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:40.297
Roll, stir, serve,

01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:42.424
and ska-blam!

01:19:47.137 --> 01:19:50.015
Yes!

01:19:50.015 --> 01:19:53.310
Second rule: Someone always gets hurt.

01:19:53.936 --> 01:19:55.563
Now, that's a cool move.

01:19:55.563 --> 01:19:58.399
Po! You could have gotten out of that cage
anytime you wanted?

01:19:58.399 --> 01:19:59.567
You faker.

01:19:59.567 --> 01:20:01.652
It's not faking. It's Method.

01:20:01.652 --> 01:20:04.864
Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

01:20:04.864 --> 01:20:07.658
if you never give it
the chance to grow?

01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:12.746
And, hey, you stirred faster
and rolled higher.

01:20:12.746 --> 01:20:15.749
But for the last time, the word is...

01:20:22.882 --> 01:20:24.008
..."skadoosh."

01:20:49.783 --> 01:20:52.494
Maybe Oogway was right about you.

01:20:55.247 --> 01:20:57.583
You aren't completely useless after all.

01:20:58.459 --> 01:21:00.002
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.

01:21:10.429 --> 01:21:12.890
That's my son.

01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:14.058
Our son.

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:19.271
I think it's time you send us home, panda.

01:21:53.681 --> 01:21:56.058
Zhen, do something!

01:21:56.058 --> 01:21:59.854
Third rule:
No one's interested in your feelings.

01:22:04.942 --> 01:22:08.946
See you on the other side, Dragon Warrior.

01:22:31.427 --> 01:22:33.596
We packed some food
for your time in jail.

01:22:33.596 --> 01:22:36.390
Let's hope it's not
your final meal.

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:37.933
Thanks, guys.

01:22:38.809 --> 01:22:43.522
I was thinking, after I serve my time
and I'm a free fox again,

01:22:43.522 --> 01:22:46.358
maybe I'll open one of those
acupuncture places that are all the rage.

01:22:46.358 --> 01:22:51.197
I think you're better suited for a job
with a little more room for growth.

01:22:55.034 --> 01:22:56.035
Jade Palace?

01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:59.622
Her?

01:22:59.622 --> 01:23:03.500
Out of all the candidates you choose
to train as your worthy successor,

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.211
you chose the fox?

01:23:05.211 --> 01:23:07.296
You know when you know,
you know?

01:23:07.296 --> 01:23:09.924
Fine, choose who you want.
A thief, a stick, a carrot.

01:23:09.924 --> 01:23:11.717
I don't even know why I bother.

01:23:11.717 --> 01:23:14.553
I'm going to go meditate... a lot.

01:23:17.014 --> 01:23:18.891
Don't worry. He'll come around.

01:23:19.558 --> 01:23:21.560
Probably. Maybe.

01:23:23.354 --> 01:23:24.939
Hey, you okay?

01:23:26.899 --> 01:23:29.610
He's right.
What about me says I'm ready for this?

01:23:30.819 --> 01:23:33.113
Well, as I learned
from working in my dad's kitchen,

01:23:33.113 --> 01:23:37.701
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

01:23:37.701 --> 01:23:39.787
Hey, that's not bad.

01:23:39.787 --> 01:23:41.622
Okay, I see you, Spiritual Leader.

01:23:41.622 --> 01:23:44.458
Yeah. I'm getting the hang of
this proverb thing.

01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:47.586
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

01:23:47.586 --> 01:23:49.588
Maybe you should
just stick to kicking butt.

01:23:49.588 --> 01:23:53.467
Money can't buy happiness,
but it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

01:23:53.467 --> 01:23:55.803
Why does it always come back
to dumplings with you?

01:23:55.803 --> 01:24:00.558
When life gives you lemons,
make pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

01:24:00.558 --> 01:24:01.642
We get it.

01:24:01.642 --> 01:24:04.562
You can't have your mooncake
and eat it too.

01:24:05.145 --> 01:24:08.399
Although, I guess you could have mooncake
and then order mango pudding on the side.

01:24:08.399 --> 01:24:10.317
Can we just start the training now?

01:24:12.903 --> 01:24:14.321
Inner peace.

01:24:15.197 --> 01:24:16.657
Inner peace.

01:24:17.449 --> 01:24:18.742
Inner peace.

01:24:18.742 --> 01:24:19.827
Hey, Master Shifu.

01:24:19.827 --> 01:24:20.911
Look, there's two of us.

01:24:20.911 --> 01:24:23.038
- You're doing great, Shifu.
- You're not breathing with your belly.

01:24:23.038 --> 01:24:24.874
- You look a little tired.
- Are you tired?

01:24:26.625 --> 01:24:28.836
- You do look like a squirrel.
- Do you want a cookie?

01:24:33.591 --> 01:24:35.259
Inner peace.

01:24:36.677 --> 01:24:38.137
Inner peace.

01:24:39.513 --> 01:24:41.307
Inner peace.

01:24:49.773 --> 01:24:51.567
Are you ready to begin your training?

01:24:52.151 --> 01:24:53.402
Are you?

01:24:53.402 --> 01:24:55.988
Yes, and I brought a little help.

01:24:56.864 --> 01:25:02.036
