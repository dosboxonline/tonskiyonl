WEBVTT

04:20.500 --> 04:22.125
Show off.

04:42.667 --> 04:46.292
Elder Luna says make your heart still.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.500
The right egg will sing to you.

04:49.542 --> 04:52.583
Elder Luna is elder.

05:13.458 --> 05:14.458
Three.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.667
Only three.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.042
We take them all.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.542
No. Never.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.625
Leave one always.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.583
That is the law.

05:30.208 --> 05:31.833
Bonding day is tomorrow.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.875
These are yours.

05:37.625 --> 05:38.625
You are older.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.750
-By length of a sunset.
-Is older.

05:44.792 --> 05:45.792
Soona.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.167
Which one sings to you?

05:54.333 --> 05:55.333
This one.

06:00.708 --> 06:01.708
Silk.

06:13.458 --> 06:15.958
We will raise them together.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.000
Like we were raised.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.542
It will be the same.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.292
Yes?

06:37.792 --> 06:39.958
Go, go, go.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.292
-Noa!
-Noa, wait!

06:57.750 --> 06:59.042
It's too far.

06:59.208 --> 07:00.583
Find another way.

07:04.875 --> 07:05.875
Noa?

07:06.917 --> 07:08.375
No!

07:11.333 --> 07:12.917
Yeah!

08:01.792 --> 08:02.792
Noa!

08:05.917 --> 08:07.417
Anaya!
Soona!

08:07.958 --> 08:08.958
Noa!

08:12.583 --> 08:14.125
-Noa!
-No!

08:38.375 --> 08:40.207
Do you wonder what
your bird will look like?

08:40.375 --> 08:42.875
Long as it does not look like you, Anaya.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.125
Scared.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.250
Blanket missing.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.500
What is it, Noa?

09:12.083 --> 09:14.583
Something in trees.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.292
It's getting away.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.917
Outsiders.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.917
Noa scared.

09:51.542 --> 09:53.000
Not Anaya.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.917
Not ape.

10:23.292 --> 10:24.375
Maybe…

10:25.667 --> 10:26.750
Echo?

10:28.542 --> 10:33.542
Echo do not come in from Valley.

10:34.042 --> 10:34.875
Oh.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.083
Were you scared?

10:55.250 --> 10:57.250
Not as scared as Anaya!

11:25.208 --> 11:26.792
They're back! They're back!

11:26.958 --> 11:28.542
-Soona!
-Did you get your eggs?

11:28.708 --> 11:30.917
-How far did you climb?
-Was it dangerous?

11:31.292 --> 11:33.417
Very dangerous.

11:33.583 --> 11:36.125
Anaya wailed like a newborn.

11:45.125 --> 11:46.875
How many eggs did you honor?

11:47.042 --> 11:48.167
-Show us the egg.
-Did you climb well?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.083
-Show us the egg.
-Show us your egg.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.208
Egg. Egg. Egg.

11:51.375 --> 11:54.542
Show us, Anaya, please?

12:17.833 --> 12:19.667
-Who want?
-Me, me, me!

12:22.542 --> 12:26.042
Come on. Come on. Give, give! Hey!

12:26.542 --> 12:27.625
Son.

12:36.042 --> 12:37.042
Show me.

12:37.208 --> 12:39.333
All must wait for bonding.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.083
Even Honored Teacher.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.083
I am your mother.

12:53.417 --> 12:56.250
I knew you would climb well.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.042
He waits.

13:09.583 --> 13:10.625
Broken?

13:12.917 --> 13:15.167
Time for that later.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.458
Your father will want to see.

13:26.458 --> 13:31.458
He will be proud.

13:47.167 --> 13:49.125
-Noa.
-Noa.

13:49.292 --> 13:52.250
Noa, didn't think you'd make it back.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.333
Too firm.

14:26.667 --> 14:29.042
Yes. Yes, Koro.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.833
Father. Master of Birds.

14:57.417 --> 14:58.333
Noa.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.333
Son.

15:07.333 --> 15:13.167
Sun Eagle does not like work
for tomorrow's ceremony.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.042
You climb well?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.458
Above Top Nest.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.708
All of you?

15:21.875 --> 15:23.375
No.

15:23.542 --> 15:24.958
Only me.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.750
What that smell?

15:43.083 --> 15:46.458
You did not go to the Valley Beyond?

15:46.625 --> 15:47.875
Never.

15:48.042 --> 15:50.208
Is forbidden.

15:51.375 --> 15:55.167
Yet blood of Echo on your blanket.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.542
We did not go to Valley Beyond.

16:02.417 --> 16:04.125
I accept.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.500
You are true, Noa.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.750
Much to learn.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.750
Much to teach.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.500
After tomorrow's bonding.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.292
Now, Elders must know.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.500
Echoes only bring trouble.

16:29.375 --> 16:32.417
Oda will chase the pests away.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.917
May I seek your counsel?

16:45.208 --> 16:50.292
This blanket had the
blood of an Echo on it.

16:50.458 --> 16:51.500
Echo.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.042
And I apologize for that.

16:53.208 --> 16:56.333
This is a bad sign for all of us.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.625
-That smell.
-And my suggestion would be…

17:05.833 --> 17:08.375
You climbed Top Nest?

17:12.291 --> 17:14.083
Hard climb.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.375
Ah, yes.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.625
Could be dangerous.

17:23.791 --> 17:24.833
Danger.

17:29.708 --> 17:30.708
Anaya!

17:35.458 --> 17:37.625
You see your father?

17:44.250 --> 17:47.792
I do not understand Eagle Sun.

17:47.958 --> 17:50.667
I do. He hate Noa.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.208
Noa.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.917
Your blanket?

17:59.458 --> 18:01.208
With Elders.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.042
They send Oda to scare Echo away.

18:06.667 --> 18:07.875
Yes, Elder.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.750
When mother was small…

18:12.417 --> 18:14.833
dry season shrank creek.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.458
Echo range for food.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.833
She saw a small and a big.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.667
We have good rain.

18:26.375 --> 18:27.458
Her words.

18:32.792 --> 18:35.042
Ride true, Oda.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.292
No.

21:15.667 --> 21:18.208
Our bonding is at sunrise.

21:19.042 --> 21:21.750
Master of Birds will make exception.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.875
They will not make him
wait for next season.

21:25.042 --> 21:26.375
Yes, he will.

21:28.292 --> 21:30.208
He is your father.

21:30.375 --> 21:34.417
And I am his son.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.000
Then I will wait with you.

21:40.708 --> 21:42.292
Anaya wait too.

21:44.250 --> 21:45.417
You cannot.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.625
I must find another.

23:43.750 --> 23:44.750
Noa.

23:45.542 --> 23:46.542
Oda!

23:47.042 --> 23:49.333
There are…

23:50.792 --> 23:52.083
more.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.958
What happened here?

24:38.458 --> 24:40.083
Our scouts.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.750
Killed by him.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.125
Human.

24:53.042 --> 24:54.250
It is her.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.125
Lightning, back on your horse.

24:56.292 --> 24:57.500
Spread out!

24:57.667 --> 24:59.625
Find his clan.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.542
Search in all directions!

25:09.458 --> 25:11.125
The ape's horse!

25:11.292 --> 25:12.625
Lightning, come!

25:21.750 --> 25:23.792
They cannot be far.

25:24.667 --> 25:27.542
Follow the horse! Find his clan!

25:29.333 --> 25:30.750
Find human!

25:31.667 --> 25:32.792
Ride!

25:36.750 --> 25:39.083
Go, go, go!

26:40.625 --> 26:41.833
Round them up!

26:42.000 --> 26:43.583
No! No! Please!

26:47.417 --> 26:48.875
You, prisoner!

26:53.250 --> 26:54.542
Burn it down.

26:57.958 --> 26:59.542
Soona!
Anaya!

26:59.708 --> 27:00.833
Noa, help!

27:11.417 --> 27:12.458
Noa!

27:13.500 --> 27:14.792
Noa!

27:14.958 --> 27:16.125
Noa!

27:16.833 --> 27:17.833
Noa!

27:19.292 --> 27:20.250
Noa!

27:21.292 --> 27:23.542
Anaya!
Mother!

27:25.417 --> 27:26.417
Where Soona?

27:26.583 --> 27:28.458
They took her.

27:28.625 --> 27:30.542
They broke my egg.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.750
Mother.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.167
Help your father!

27:35.250 --> 27:36.583
No! No!

27:38.042 --> 27:38.875
Noa!

27:40.333 --> 27:41.333
No!

27:43.875 --> 27:45.208
Run, Noa! Run!

27:46.500 --> 27:48.125
Help your father!

27:48.292 --> 27:50.125
Go, Noa! Run!

27:52.625 --> 27:53.583
No!

27:57.667 --> 27:59.500
He their Elder.

28:06.708 --> 28:07.542
No!

28:15.708 --> 28:18.125
For Caesar!

28:18.625 --> 28:20.292
For Caesar!

28:22.792 --> 28:24.958
Take them to Proximus!

28:26.375 --> 28:28.083
Find the human!

28:28.250 --> 28:29.417
Caesar! Caesar!

28:31.750 --> 28:34.292
Caesar! Caesar!

28:45.667 --> 28:47.292
-Father.
-Son.

28:47.458 --> 28:49.000
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

28:49.167 --> 28:51.125
Noa, free all birds.

28:51.583 --> 28:52.458
Go.

29:28.542 --> 29:31.708
Bend your head.

31:14.208 --> 31:15.500
Noa.

31:21.667 --> 31:23.125
For Caesar.

34:21.958 --> 34:22.958
Father…

34:26.292 --> 34:27.792
I will find them.

34:29.417 --> 34:32.542
I will bring them home.

36:27.125 --> 36:28.583
Mother.

37:39.375 --> 37:40.375
Sun.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.167
Come, Sun.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.958
How young you are.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.875
Without your mask.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.458
Without this.

40:08.833 --> 40:09.875
Speak up.

40:11.417 --> 40:14.333
Speak up.

40:15.042 --> 40:16.458
Not mine.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.875
No mask.

40:20.125 --> 40:21.333
I am not…

40:22.500 --> 40:23.542
them.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.958
Explain yourself.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.500
They killed my father.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.542
Stole my village.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.458
I follow their tracks.

40:50.167 --> 40:53.500
He was my village.

40:56.708 --> 40:58.708
They killed him.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.500
The Masks.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.333
I am Raka.

41:18.583 --> 41:20.500
I am Noa.

41:32.125 --> 41:35.542
Apes falling from the sky.

41:40.375 --> 41:45.083
He was outside when they arrived.

41:45.250 --> 41:47.125
Did you see my clan?

41:48.292 --> 41:49.333
No.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.625
I hid.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.208
I survived.

41:55.667 --> 41:58.750
I protected our work.

42:08.167 --> 42:13.792
They are an ancient way to store ideas.

42:18.875 --> 42:21.500
The symbols have meaning.

42:25.583 --> 42:28.667
Apes understood this meaning…

42:28.833 --> 42:30.875
in the time of Caesar.

42:33.458 --> 42:36.875
The Masks, in my village…

42:38.375 --> 42:40.375
said that name…

42:42.333 --> 42:43.792
"Caesar."

42:44.875 --> 42:46.250
Shameful.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.542
The Masks take his name.

42:51.042 --> 42:52.417
Twist his words.

42:53.333 --> 42:55.042
Who is he?

42:55.833 --> 42:56.958
Not "is."

42:58.083 --> 42:59.083
"Was."

43:02.667 --> 43:06.583
Your clan does not know the true Caesar.

43:07.917 --> 43:11.125
Too many have forgotten who he was.

43:13.250 --> 43:16.042
I know Elders of my village.

43:16.208 --> 43:17.917
They made the law.

43:18.083 --> 43:19.375
That is everything.

43:21.208 --> 43:24.083
That is not everything.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.000
Long before your Elders…

43:27.167 --> 43:31.417
it was Caesar who taught us
what it means to be ape.

43:31.583 --> 43:36.042
He was our leader, our lawgiver.

43:36.208 --> 43:38.958
Apes together strong.

43:39.125 --> 43:41.833
Ape shall not kill ape.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.750
We, the Order of Caesar…

43:44.917 --> 43:46.667
follow his words.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.292
To this day…

43:49.667 --> 43:51.125
I follow.

43:52.792 --> 43:54.083
I am now…

43:55.417 --> 43:56.833
the last.

43:58.917 --> 44:00.833
The work continues.

44:04.875 --> 44:06.417
What is this place?

44:07.083 --> 44:09.958
We believe apes built this…

44:10.125 --> 44:13.667
as a refuge for humans.

44:13.833 --> 44:15.708
Now it is rare to see even one.

44:15.875 --> 44:21.167
But in Caesar's time,
there were vast herds of them.

44:22.250 --> 44:23.583
Can you imagine?

44:25.000 --> 44:29.542
Perhaps here, humans were cared for, fed…

44:29.708 --> 44:32.500
maybe even taught.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.083
What is it?

44:42.958 --> 44:44.125
Echo.

44:48.458 --> 44:49.500
Human.

44:52.292 --> 44:53.833
You have seen one?

44:54.833 --> 44:55.667
One.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.667
They are scavengers.

44:59.833 --> 45:01.542
Like boars.

45:01.708 --> 45:03.333
Only lesser.

45:03.500 --> 45:07.125
Humans are slow-witted, but…

45:08.708 --> 45:10.250
there was a time…

45:11.167 --> 45:15.083
when humans and apes lived side by side.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.167
Yes, it is a puzzle. I know. But…

45:25.583 --> 45:28.333
they were important to Caesar.

45:28.500 --> 45:32.667
So they are important to me.

45:37.167 --> 45:39.250
I have to get to my horse.

45:40.542 --> 45:42.083
Of course.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.417
Follow me.

45:47.125 --> 45:49.792
You do not know Caesar.

45:51.292 --> 45:53.667
You do not know books.

45:57.708 --> 45:59.667
You should stay here.

45:59.833 --> 46:02.292
There is much I could teach you.

46:10.250 --> 46:11.250
Go away!

46:11.417 --> 46:12.792
No! Come back!

46:12.958 --> 46:13.792
Pest!

46:13.958 --> 46:16.083
Wait! Come back!

46:17.000 --> 46:19.875
There is no danger.

46:20.833 --> 46:22.917
That is the one.

46:23.083 --> 46:25.500
Stole from my village.

46:26.875 --> 46:30.292
She follows you from your village?

46:34.000 --> 46:38.750
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

46:42.833 --> 46:45.500
Wait here. The work continues.

46:45.667 --> 46:46.833
I have no time for…

46:47.000 --> 46:50.167
I will not slow you down.
I, too, keep a horse.

46:57.458 --> 47:00.167
Can we not slow down?

47:00.333 --> 47:01.208
No.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.458
I am sure she follows.

47:06.625 --> 47:07.958
I do not know why.

47:14.042 --> 47:16.375
A beautiful bird!

47:18.583 --> 47:20.125
Eagle Sun.

47:21.208 --> 47:22.667
My father's bird.

47:23.833 --> 47:25.708
He follows to taunt me.

47:26.958 --> 47:30.750
This bird follows you too?

47:32.292 --> 47:35.208
We raise eagles, my clan.

47:35.958 --> 47:37.000
Sing to them…

47:37.958 --> 47:39.375
so they know us.

47:39.542 --> 47:40.708
A bond.

47:42.875 --> 47:44.208
Sing the song.

47:45.167 --> 47:46.375
Please.

47:49.708 --> 47:50.708
No.

47:52.708 --> 47:54.667
My father was Master of Birds.

47:54.833 --> 47:56.333
He sang to eagles.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.500
But I am not him.

48:02.458 --> 48:03.458
Shame.

48:04.875 --> 48:07.917
I would have enjoyed a song.

48:30.042 --> 48:31.542
Strange weapons.

48:32.875 --> 48:33.792
Broken.

49:06.250 --> 49:07.333
Raka.

49:12.000 --> 49:12.958
Noa.

49:19.292 --> 49:22.292
She follows because she is hungry.

49:31.042 --> 49:32.542
No, no, no.

49:34.542 --> 49:36.208
This is…

49:38.125 --> 49:39.625
important.

49:41.167 --> 49:43.333
They get cold.

49:46.500 --> 49:48.083
Show mercy.

50:10.083 --> 50:12.458
She is smarter than most.

50:18.250 --> 50:21.333
We will name her Nova.

50:23.500 --> 50:26.375
We name them all Nova.

50:27.417 --> 50:30.417
I do not know why.
It is from Caesar's time.

50:31.375 --> 50:36.208
Why did Caesar care so much for Echoes?

50:36.750 --> 50:41.417
Legend says he was reared by them…

50:42.958 --> 50:45.417
impossible as that may seem.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.125
Caesar legend is important.

50:51.125 --> 50:53.542
He was first Elder.

50:55.083 --> 50:57.958
He led with decency…

50:59.375 --> 51:00.667
morality…

51:02.417 --> 51:03.792
strength…

51:06.917 --> 51:08.292
compassion.

51:13.167 --> 51:16.333
Caesar never had to share camp…

51:16.917 --> 51:19.750
with this Nova.

51:31.875 --> 51:33.917
The smell is potent.

54:27.958 --> 54:32.667
A tunnel that eats light?

54:33.917 --> 54:35.833
She saw what I saw.

54:36.917 --> 54:38.500
It was in her eyes.

54:38.667 --> 54:39.875
She…

54:40.917 --> 54:42.208
reacted.

54:43.375 --> 54:44.375
How?

54:47.917 --> 54:49.667
As ape would.

54:57.417 --> 54:58.917
If Echo comes, she must ride.

55:00.042 --> 55:04.042
Is my young companion showing compassion
for our fellow traveler?

55:05.042 --> 55:06.250
She is slow.

55:23.958 --> 55:25.792
Horse.

55:34.917 --> 55:38.292
Then, of course, there is the gibbon.

55:39.083 --> 55:40.875
Very, very long arms.

55:41.208 --> 55:47.333
Is most unfortunate that the human
can only use its feet for walking.

55:48.333 --> 55:50.792
Imagine if you were falling from a tree.

55:50.958 --> 55:53.500
You only have two appendages
to save your life.

55:53.667 --> 55:56.958
But if you were able to use
both of your hands…

55:57.125 --> 55:59.083
and both of your feet…

55:59.250 --> 56:01.583
that's four times the safety.

56:01.750 --> 56:06.625
And I imagine that,
if I came across a special…

56:08.500 --> 56:11.000
What is that?

56:37.208 --> 56:39.917
Horses with stripes.

56:42.167 --> 56:44.208
Quite striking.

57:32.542 --> 57:36.792
We feared the herds ceased to exist.

58:00.542 --> 58:02.750
Will you not say goodbye?

58:05.125 --> 58:08.208
I must find my clan.

58:09.917 --> 58:12.625
The Nova stays with her kind.

58:13.833 --> 58:15.458
You raise them up.

58:16.958 --> 58:20.708
Follow Caesar's word.

58:30.625 --> 58:32.125
To remember…

58:33.458 --> 58:35.292
who he was.

58:39.167 --> 58:41.167
It is important.

59:11.333 --> 59:12.792
They are like you.

59:14.500 --> 59:16.458
Would you like to join them?

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
He has his journey.

59:38.083 --> 59:39.958
We have ours.

59:40.583 --> 59:41.583
Come.

01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:31.000
Nova!

01:00:31.958 --> 01:00:33.292
Nova!

01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:01.125
Take them!

01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:08.708
Ride them down!

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.750
Catch that one!

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:53.625
This one?

01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:02.667
There!

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:25.792
Spread out.

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:27.125
Lightning.

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:40.958
This way.

01:02:41.917 --> 01:02:42.917
Find her!

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.917
I know she here!

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.083
Raka!

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.083
Nova!

01:03:03.875 --> 01:03:05.167
Come out!

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:07.042
I smell you!

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.542
Raka!

01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:18.042
Noa!

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.208
Noa!

01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:19.125
Raka!

01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:23.167
Caesar will forgive.

01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:25.625
Shall we continue?

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:49.292
This should give us time.

01:05:27.167 --> 01:05:29.542
What did I miss?

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:31.167
She spoke.

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:36.375
She called my name.

01:05:36.542 --> 01:05:38.875
You misheard.

01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:43.708
You said this Nova was smarter than most.

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:45.333
Within reason.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.750
Some intelligence, to be sure, but…

01:05:48.917 --> 01:05:50.458
I have a name.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:53.375
Mae.

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:00.000
I know where they're taking your clan.

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:10.958
It's a human settlement.

01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:14.250
It's where I'm headed to.

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:16.542
Looking for more like me.

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.167
There are more…

01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:20.167
like you?

01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.458
There used to be more.

01:06:25.292 --> 01:06:28.333
You hid the truth?

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.708
My mother taught me silence…

01:06:32.208 --> 01:06:33.833
for my safety.

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:37.583
You were safe with us.

01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:40.875
And still not true.

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:44.583
Where is your mother now?

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:49.833
I am alone.

01:06:54.167 --> 01:06:56.375
As are we all.

01:06:57.583 --> 01:06:58.833
But now…

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:02.792
we have each other.

01:07:16.917 --> 01:07:18.917
Let us have a fire.

01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:21.500
We have much to discuss.

01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:50.000
Go back.

01:10:50.792 --> 01:10:51.958
Go back!

01:10:58.458 --> 01:10:59.458
Noa!

01:11:02.875 --> 01:11:04.083
Mae!

01:11:09.542 --> 01:11:10.542
Mae!

01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:11.750
No!

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:27.833
Mae!

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:33.375
Hold on!

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.583
Mae!

01:11:50.833 --> 01:11:52.333
No! Raka!

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.500
Raka!

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:08.917
Together…

01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:11.250
strong.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.083
Stand back! Human!

01:14:33.792 --> 01:14:35.042
No! No! No!

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:51.917
Welcome home, baby bird.

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:03.458
Go!

01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:57.792
Noa!

01:16:01.292 --> 01:16:04.250
I missed you. Soona. Soona.

01:16:07.625 --> 01:16:08.625
No.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.458
You were dead.

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:17.083
I saw you fall.

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:19.875
You are not hurt?

01:16:21.083 --> 01:16:22.042
No.

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:23.750
No.

01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:30.958
Mother?

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:32.125
Anaya?

01:17:23.667 --> 01:17:24.833
Vonnegut.

01:17:25.917 --> 01:17:27.375
That's a good one.

01:17:28.333 --> 01:17:30.250
Not a lot of fiction there.

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:33.875
He's mostly interested in history.

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.875
Roman history, especially.

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:44.875
The name's Trevathan.

01:17:50.292 --> 01:17:51.625
Where are you from?

01:17:54.667 --> 01:17:55.917
You first.

01:17:57.917 --> 01:18:01.667
Well, doesn't really matter, does it?

01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:03.042
I left.

01:18:04.583 --> 01:18:06.125
Same as you.

01:18:06.292 --> 01:18:08.875
Made it almost to the coast…

01:18:09.042 --> 01:18:12.125
and then I fell and shattered my ankles.

01:18:12.292 --> 01:18:14.167
That's where Proximus found me.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.375
And now you read him Roman history.

01:18:23.458 --> 01:18:25.542
So, who are you?

01:18:26.792 --> 01:18:29.917
I'm the human not helping the apes.

01:18:46.042 --> 01:18:47.500
Noa.

01:18:49.708 --> 01:18:51.750
Share. Must share.

01:18:51.917 --> 01:18:52.833
Good.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:57.833
Noa?

01:18:58.417 --> 01:18:59.667
-Noa!
-You're alive!

01:19:17.333 --> 01:19:18.583
Father…

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:20.417
he's…

01:19:20.583 --> 01:19:22.875
I know.

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:42.042
We must go.

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:44.833
Come.

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:56.250
Caesar!

01:20:03.292 --> 01:20:09.042
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

01:20:54.167 --> 01:20:55.917
What a wonderful day!

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.625
What a wonderful day!

01:20:59.667 --> 01:21:03.500
Are we thankful for the words of Caesar?

01:21:03.667 --> 01:21:05.542
We are thankful.

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:07.792
Do we bend our heads?

01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:09.833
We bend!

01:21:10.375 --> 01:21:12.167
Say his words!

01:21:12.333 --> 01:21:14.375
Apes together strong!

01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:16.208
Say his words!

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:18.708
Apes together strong!

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.583
What a wonderful day!

01:21:31.042 --> 01:21:32.583
That felt good.

01:21:33.167 --> 01:21:36.042
When I think on those words…

01:21:36.208 --> 01:21:39.125
I feel good.

01:21:41.583 --> 01:21:44.792
Caesar was first Elder.

01:21:44.958 --> 01:21:48.958
Now I am Caesar.

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:54.208
He is not Caesar.

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:57.833
Careful, son. We are his now.

01:22:02.333 --> 01:22:08.167
Now, when I think of all the treasures
left inside for us…

01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:13.000
I feel very good.

01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:18.000
It may be difficult to open.

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:20.583
But not impossible…

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:23.667
because we work together.

01:22:24.708 --> 01:22:27.083
All as one.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.167
As Caesar wanted.

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:32.292
As Caesar required.

01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:35.125
Apes together strong!

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Pull!

01:22:47.667 --> 01:22:49.500
Pull!

01:22:50.542 --> 01:22:52.500
Pull! More!

01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:59.875
Watch this.

01:23:13.042 --> 01:23:14.708
-Pull!
-Pull!

01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:16.917
Pull!

01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:23.292
Yes!

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.083
Yes!

01:23:30.667 --> 01:23:32.500
More!

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:45.292
Enough!

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:54.750
Maybe stronger tomorrow.

01:24:14.292 --> 01:24:15.708
Don't worry.

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:18.208
Whoever's in there is either dead or gone.

01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:22.792
We've been bangin'
on that door for months.

01:24:25.875 --> 01:24:27.667
Do you not know where we are?

01:24:28.292 --> 01:24:31.583
When things got bad
and the government went underground…

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.625
this is where half of it went.

01:24:33.792 --> 01:24:36.958
With all their technology,
and all their weapons…

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:40.708
Don't you understand?

01:24:41.625 --> 01:24:43.875
That ape cannot have what is inside the…

01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:47.167
You gotta stop thinking
about the way things were…

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.625
and start thinking about
the way they are.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:51.708
This is a good life…

01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:54.250
and you have a chance to be a part of it.

01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:57.208
What, and build a world for the apes?

01:24:57.375 --> 01:25:00.167
It is already their world.

01:25:08.292 --> 01:25:11.250
There's hot water and fresh clothes
in that room back there.

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:15.583
You'll feel better
when you get yourself cleaned up.

01:25:17.167 --> 01:25:19.625
You better figure out
how to be useful around here.

01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:27.833
Honored Elder…

01:25:28.917 --> 01:25:29.917
had to bend.

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:34.083
We had no choice.

01:25:35.917 --> 01:25:37.458
You must accept.

01:25:40.792 --> 01:25:41.958
It is law.

01:25:44.208 --> 01:25:49.208
The Elders did not tell us everything…

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:51.417
about this world.

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:56.000
They did not tell us
because they did not know.

01:25:57.292 --> 01:26:00.417
They did not want to know.

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:08.458
You are different.

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:13.542
Come.

01:26:28.667 --> 01:26:31.042
And that's why they call it a toga party.

01:26:34.333 --> 01:26:38.292
You are a funny little human, Trevathan.

01:26:43.708 --> 01:26:44.917
Hey, come.

01:26:45.542 --> 01:26:46.583
Come, sit.

01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:49.458
Please.

01:26:51.958 --> 01:26:52.875
Go.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:54.667
Go.

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:07.708
Wonderful day, yes?

01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:14.292
You two have come a long way.

01:27:16.292 --> 01:27:18.583
An ape and a human…

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:20.375
traveling together is…

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.417
quite an adventure.

01:27:26.167 --> 01:27:27.625
You are Noa, yes?

01:27:28.333 --> 01:27:30.458
Welcome, Noa.

01:27:45.625 --> 01:27:46.458
Go.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.458
Mae…

01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:59.250
you are familiar with the concept of…

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:01.667
evolution?

01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:04.375
That is the human label, yeah?

01:28:04.542 --> 01:28:09.000
The advancement that
I crave requires time.

01:28:09.167 --> 01:28:13.042
Vast amounts of time that I do not have.

01:28:14.375 --> 01:28:17.583
Unfortunately, I am but a mortal ape.

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:24.833
So this is why I need to get the knowledge
inside that vault.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.292
I believe it will deliver…

01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:29.708
instant evolution.

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:32.875
Noa.

01:28:33.917 --> 01:28:35.250
You don't understand.

01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:38.083
In their time…

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:43.875
humans were capable
of many great things, yes?

01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:46.292
They could level mountains.

01:28:48.083 --> 01:28:50.500
They could speak across oceans.

01:28:50.667 --> 01:28:53.250
They could fly, Noa.

01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:55.625
Like eagles fly.

01:28:55.792 --> 01:28:58.875
But now, we will learn.

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:02.542
Apes will learn. I will learn, yeah…

01:29:02.708 --> 01:29:05.583
from what is inside that vault.

01:29:06.917 --> 01:29:08.167
It's Impossible.

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:11.292
No one's getting in there.

01:29:16.917 --> 01:29:19.125
Mae, Mae, Mae, Mae.

01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:26.625
My apes encountered your companions.

01:29:27.792 --> 01:29:31.167
I believe this map belonged to you.

01:29:31.792 --> 01:29:33.292
You see, Noa…

01:29:33.833 --> 01:29:36.250
before she was traveling with you…

01:29:36.417 --> 01:29:40.500
and that old orangutan…

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:43.917
Mae was with other humans.

01:29:46.917 --> 01:29:48.208
But sadly…

01:29:50.042 --> 01:29:53.542
my apes did not realize their value…

01:29:53.708 --> 01:29:57.333
so I was brought only bodies.

01:29:58.208 --> 01:30:02.625
I could not speak to them
like I can speak to you.

01:30:04.542 --> 01:30:05.542
I know…

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:10.042
you are coming here
to get inside my vault.

01:30:10.208 --> 01:30:11.833
It is not yours!

01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:16.042
It is now, isn't it?

01:30:17.042 --> 01:30:19.375
And I will get inside.

01:30:20.292 --> 01:30:24.583
No matter how many apes it costs me.

01:30:25.458 --> 01:30:26.458
Noa.

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:33.708
I have heard that you are
a very clever ape, yeah?

01:30:34.667 --> 01:30:35.667
Very clever.

01:30:35.833 --> 01:30:39.875
He repaired one of your
broken staffs, Trevathan.

01:30:42.792 --> 01:30:46.542
I have much use for clever apes.

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:49.250
Now, can you tell me…

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:55.125
did Mae tell you how
to get inside my vault?

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.917
She told me nothing.

01:31:02.833 --> 01:31:04.500
Told you nothing!

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:05.667
Nothing.

01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:11.333
Told you nothing.

01:31:15.542 --> 01:31:16.583
Noa.

01:31:17.583 --> 01:31:19.583
Come. Come with me.

01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:20.917
Come, come.

01:31:22.417 --> 01:31:24.000
I have something to show you.

01:31:25.042 --> 01:31:27.000
Come. Come.

01:31:28.833 --> 01:31:29.958
Come, Noa.

01:31:31.625 --> 01:31:33.708
Tell me, what do you see?

01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:45.458
Stolen clans.

01:31:48.083 --> 01:31:49.500
Not clans.

01:31:51.375 --> 01:31:52.458
A kingdom.

01:31:54.042 --> 01:31:57.750
Noa, a kingdom for apes.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.708
Humans can never be trusted.

01:32:06.417 --> 01:32:09.083
Where there are two that can speak…

01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:11.083
there must be more.

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:18.958
Mae has come here to claim
the tools inside my vault.

01:32:19.125 --> 01:32:22.292
Tools that make humans strong…

01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:24.542
and make them dangerous.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.250
That is why I must have them first.

01:32:29.417 --> 01:32:30.625
Yeah?

01:32:30.792 --> 01:32:35.833
They do not understand
that this is our time.

01:32:36.375 --> 01:32:38.500
This is my kingdom.

01:32:41.833 --> 01:32:44.875
I must destroy their kind.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.458
Unless we want to live in cages again.

01:32:56.417 --> 01:32:57.667
Come.

01:32:57.833 --> 01:32:59.333
Come, Noa.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:00.833
Let us eat.

01:33:02.833 --> 01:33:03.875
Trevathan!

01:33:04.417 --> 01:33:05.917
Tell us a story.

01:33:06.417 --> 01:33:08.125
Make it a funny one.

01:33:31.125 --> 01:33:33.000
They will not come.

01:33:36.792 --> 01:33:37.792
Why?

01:33:39.708 --> 01:33:42.125
Because Eagle Clan…

01:33:44.042 --> 01:33:45.125
is gone.

01:33:48.417 --> 01:33:53.500
Eagle Clan is here.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.042
We are here.

01:33:59.542 --> 01:34:01.500
In land of Proximus.

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:08.208
And Proximus has no need for eagles.

01:34:42.625 --> 01:34:46.458
You come to judge me?

01:34:51.875 --> 01:34:53.708
I judge myself.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:59.292
I promised our father…

01:34:59.458 --> 01:35:01.042
I would bring them home.

01:35:05.458 --> 01:35:06.708
I failed.

01:35:08.958 --> 01:35:11.417
Eagle Clan belongs…

01:35:11.583 --> 01:35:15.625
to Proximus Caesar now.

01:35:19.292 --> 01:35:21.875
That is the law.

01:35:37.292 --> 01:35:42.000
But the law is wrong.

01:36:29.792 --> 01:36:32.500
Time for the evening lesson.

01:36:32.667 --> 01:36:35.583
It would be very good for you to be there.

01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:17.250
You did not come for Echoes.

01:37:18.917 --> 01:37:21.833
And you were not alone.

01:37:23.125 --> 01:37:24.208
I'm sorry.

01:37:26.792 --> 01:37:29.208
Proximus's apes found our camp.

01:37:31.875 --> 01:37:33.417
They killed everyone.

01:37:34.792 --> 01:37:36.750
I barely escaped.

01:37:37.667 --> 01:37:39.458
I needed your help.

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:43.083
-And I was afraid.
-The more you speak…

01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:45.250
the less I believe.

01:37:45.417 --> 01:37:47.333
I was wrong not to trust you.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.500
And I know that now.

01:37:48.667 --> 01:37:51.792
I trust you only to help yourself.

01:37:54.167 --> 01:37:56.625
But that could help me now.

01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:02.417
I have questions.

01:38:03.792 --> 01:38:05.333
You answer true…

01:38:06.167 --> 01:38:07.542
maybe I help.

01:38:10.667 --> 01:38:13.083
What do you need inside vault?

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:16.500
It's…

01:38:17.417 --> 01:38:18.625
like a book.

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:21.167
-A special book.
-How?

01:38:22.667 --> 01:38:23.542
Special?

01:38:25.042 --> 01:38:27.792
Humans lost their ability to speak.

01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:29.708
And this book might bring it back.

01:38:31.375 --> 01:38:33.167
A book can do this?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.250
This one can.

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:47.250
Raka said apes and humans…

01:38:48.583 --> 01:38:50.208
lived side by side.

01:38:52.833 --> 01:38:54.167
True or not true?

01:38:57.292 --> 01:38:58.458
Apes were silent.

01:39:00.208 --> 01:39:01.417
Like the Echo.

01:39:03.083 --> 01:39:04.667
Humans were dominant.

01:39:06.167 --> 01:39:07.542
The virus spread…

01:39:08.792 --> 01:39:10.250
that we created.

01:39:11.292 --> 01:39:12.917
It made apes smarter.

01:39:14.292 --> 01:39:16.292
And it almost killed all of us.

01:39:23.167 --> 01:39:25.875
You know a way inside, yes?

01:39:27.542 --> 01:39:28.542
Yes.

01:39:30.125 --> 01:39:31.917
One last question.

01:39:35.083 --> 01:39:39.333
Will water destroy what is inside?

01:39:59.792 --> 01:40:00.792
Noa.

01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:06.042
I need your help.

01:40:07.792 --> 01:40:09.625
What help?

01:40:13.583 --> 01:40:15.833
A climb.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.500
One I cannot do alone.

01:40:19.667 --> 01:40:20.667
Why?

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.750
To free our clan.

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:49.583
Anaya scared.

01:41:24.958 --> 01:41:27.250
Soona, this is Mae.

01:41:29.667 --> 01:41:30.792
Hello, Soona.

01:41:35.292 --> 01:41:36.625
What do we do?

01:41:38.708 --> 01:41:40.208
We're gonna need all of this.

01:41:41.208 --> 01:41:42.375
Follow me.

01:41:56.083 --> 01:41:57.250
Careful.

01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:04.083
The power runs through, yes?

01:42:06.417 --> 01:42:07.417
Yes.

01:42:23.833 --> 01:42:27.417
You cannot make hard climb…

01:42:30.292 --> 01:42:31.792
without Anaya.

01:42:45.833 --> 01:42:47.000
Hello, Echo.

01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:05.333
This burns hot.

01:43:05.875 --> 01:43:07.375
But under pressure…

01:43:08.792 --> 01:43:10.833
it will explode.

01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:14.167
How do you know this?

01:43:20.667 --> 01:43:21.875
Oh, shit.

01:43:27.208 --> 01:43:28.125
"Shit"?

01:43:29.417 --> 01:43:31.542
-Take that over there.
-Okay.

01:43:31.708 --> 01:43:33.625
I go with Anaya.

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:35.792
Safer that way.

01:43:37.167 --> 01:43:40.208
Anaya! Anaya. Stop.

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:41.958
You're doing it wrong.

01:43:42.125 --> 01:43:42.958
Okay.

01:43:43.125 --> 01:43:44.250
You like her.

01:43:46.917 --> 01:43:47.750
Soona.

01:43:49.875 --> 01:43:51.792
We were born within a sunset.

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:56.667
No. Anaya…

01:43:56.833 --> 01:43:58.583
He's just going to rebuild it.

01:44:10.292 --> 01:44:11.292
You…

01:44:13.958 --> 01:44:15.583
You had an opportunity.

01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:18.417
I gave you an opportunity.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.625
But you're fantasizing about a past
that can never come back.

01:44:30.167 --> 01:44:31.542
Listen to me.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.417
Trevathan, you don't belong here.

01:44:38.917 --> 01:44:41.083
You think it's over…

01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:42.500
but it's not.

01:44:43.917 --> 01:44:47.917
Nobody is going to blame you
for what happened here.

01:44:49.708 --> 01:44:52.792
Just come with us.

01:44:55.583 --> 01:44:56.583
Please?

01:45:04.208 --> 01:45:06.625
He's gonna skin your monkey alive.

01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:12.167
And you…

01:45:13.333 --> 01:45:14.333
Well…

01:45:16.417 --> 01:45:18.250
you're gonna learn.

01:45:26.208 --> 01:45:27.208
Oh, no.

01:45:27.417 --> 01:45:28.500
Please!

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:30.833
We need to go.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.250
It'll be light soon.

01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:55.083
You said there would be climb!

01:47:09.417 --> 01:47:10.458
Mae, wait!

01:47:17.958 --> 01:47:19.292
Mae!

01:47:23.417 --> 01:47:24.417
There!

01:47:25.375 --> 01:47:27.208
We need to go up there.

01:47:29.083 --> 01:47:30.833
Now we climb?

01:47:52.042 --> 01:47:53.375
Easier than Top Nest.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.167
Keep climbing.

01:48:19.875 --> 01:48:20.875
Noa!

01:48:33.875 --> 01:48:34.875
Shit?

01:48:36.125 --> 01:48:37.125
Mm-hmm.

01:49:40.792 --> 01:49:41.958
Wait. Careful.

01:49:47.167 --> 01:49:48.167
Oops.

01:49:48.958 --> 01:49:50.083
Anaya!

01:50:19.375 --> 01:50:23.083
Noa, what is this place?

01:50:25.625 --> 01:50:26.708
It smells.

01:50:36.125 --> 01:50:37.458
What is that? Noa!

01:50:38.458 --> 01:50:39.958
Noa! What happening?

01:51:15.250 --> 01:51:17.292
Echo build all this?

01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:42.292
Wait here.

01:52:35.375 --> 01:52:36.500
Mama!

01:53:50.250 --> 01:53:53.458
The symbols have meaning.

01:54:46.875 --> 01:54:48.292
Time to go.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.375
Whoa. What are they?

01:55:17.667 --> 01:55:18.500
Come!

01:55:57.625 --> 01:55:59.083
We'll have to move fast.

01:55:59.750 --> 01:56:00.917
You go to your clan…

01:56:01.417 --> 01:56:02.958
and I'll trigger the explosion.

01:56:58.208 --> 01:57:03.333
Noa, you are a very useful ape.

01:57:04.625 --> 01:57:08.625
You understand so many things.

01:57:08.792 --> 01:57:11.375
And yet, you fail to observe…

01:57:11.542 --> 01:57:14.708
one of the most important.

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.417
You cannot trust a human!

01:57:21.042 --> 01:57:24.750
Here comes your clan to bear witness.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.292
You may be fool enough…

01:57:30.458 --> 01:57:34.667
to put your faith
in such a duplicitous creature.

01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:38.417
But I am not.

01:57:46.542 --> 01:57:47.750
Tell me, Noa…

01:57:48.542 --> 01:57:50.458
ape to ape…

01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:56.875
what did Mae have planned for me
inside my own vault?

01:57:59.542 --> 01:58:00.458
Okay.

01:58:01.042 --> 01:58:03.875
So what do you choose?

01:58:04.292 --> 01:58:07.417
A human over an ape?

01:58:08.458 --> 01:58:11.917
Your sweet little Soona…

01:58:13.708 --> 01:58:16.167
or that stinky human?

01:58:17.292 --> 01:58:18.500
Tell me your plan!

01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:21.875
No!

01:58:58.625 --> 01:58:59.958
I see.

01:59:02.083 --> 01:59:04.625
You can leave, Mae.

01:59:06.167 --> 01:59:07.250
You can go.

01:59:07.708 --> 01:59:10.000
You're free. Just tell me…

01:59:10.958 --> 01:59:15.667
are there more of those in there?

01:59:22.125 --> 01:59:23.250
Mae?

01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:25.542
Mae.

01:59:27.375 --> 01:59:28.292
No.

01:59:29.792 --> 01:59:31.667
We cannot.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.125
He can't have it.

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.750
Mae.

01:59:37.458 --> 01:59:38.750
-I'm sorry.
-Mae!

01:59:40.042 --> 01:59:41.083
No!

01:59:42.708 --> 01:59:43.958
Mae, no!

01:59:46.167 --> 01:59:47.375
Mae!

02:00:11.792 --> 02:00:13.208
What have you done?

02:00:19.958 --> 02:00:21.250
Climb.

02:00:21.417 --> 02:00:22.417
Climb!

02:00:23.375 --> 02:00:24.667
-Climb!
-No.

02:00:30.250 --> 02:00:31.250
No!

02:01:14.875 --> 02:01:16.583
Noa! Noa!

02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:18.750
-Soona!
-Behind you!

02:01:19.208 --> 02:01:21.000
Climb!

02:01:22.417 --> 02:01:24.042
Son! Son!

02:01:24.208 --> 02:01:25.375
-Mother!
-Son!

02:01:25.833 --> 02:01:27.542
Mother! Mother!

02:01:27.792 --> 02:01:28.792
Mother!

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:31.458
Dar!

02:01:31.625 --> 02:01:33.125
Grab her!

02:01:33.417 --> 02:01:35.542
Dar! Grab my hand!

02:01:35.708 --> 02:01:38.542
-Mother!
-Dar!

02:01:41.833 --> 02:01:42.750
Dar!

02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:47.833
Dar, got you.

02:01:48.958 --> 02:01:50.583
Noa, what we do?

02:01:52.583 --> 02:01:54.458
This way! Go!

02:02:02.042 --> 02:02:05.125
Eagle Clan! Climb!

02:02:05.292 --> 02:02:07.542
Follow Soona! Follow Anaya!

02:02:07.708 --> 02:02:09.833
-This way! Climb!
-Go. Go.

02:02:10.292 --> 02:02:11.292
Climb!

02:02:19.375 --> 02:02:20.458
This way!

02:02:22.208 --> 02:02:23.333
Hurry!

02:02:25.042 --> 02:02:26.083
Follow Soona!

02:02:26.542 --> 02:02:28.458
-Hurry! Hurry!
-Go!

02:02:33.208 --> 02:02:34.042
Come.

02:02:34.208 --> 02:02:35.250
Go!

02:02:35.417 --> 02:02:36.500
Climb, Soona!

02:02:36.667 --> 02:02:38.208
This the way out!

02:02:38.708 --> 02:02:39.875
Hurry!

02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:41.250
-Climb!
-Noa!

02:02:41.417 --> 02:02:42.542
Mother, go!

02:02:42.708 --> 02:02:44.208
-Noa!
-Climb, Anaya!

02:02:44.375 --> 02:02:45.667
-Soona, go!
-Lead them!

02:02:45.833 --> 02:02:47.292
Go! Climb!

02:02:47.458 --> 02:02:48.417
Go!

02:02:48.583 --> 02:02:50.083
Go, hurry!

02:05:34.708 --> 02:05:37.792
You think you can destroy my kingdom?

02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:51.333
You think you can destroy what I am?

02:05:57.167 --> 02:05:58.167
-Noa!
-Leave him.

02:06:11.708 --> 02:06:13.125
Noa.

02:06:14.792 --> 02:06:18.708
You showed so much promise.

02:06:20.458 --> 02:06:23.208
You are going to stand…

02:06:23.875 --> 02:06:27.125
so that you can bend for your king…

02:06:27.917 --> 02:06:29.125
before you die.

02:06:34.292 --> 02:06:38.292
And you will all bear witness…

02:06:38.458 --> 02:06:43.917
as Noa bends before his king.

02:06:47.625 --> 02:06:49.000
Now stand.

02:06:49.958 --> 02:06:51.583
Stand now!

02:06:54.833 --> 02:06:55.667
That's it.

02:06:56.250 --> 02:06:57.917
Clever ape.

02:07:21.833 --> 02:07:23.333
What is this?

02:07:26.667 --> 02:07:28.500
Trevathan would love this.

02:07:58.958 --> 02:07:59.958
Enough!

02:08:02.417 --> 02:08:03.375
Enough!

02:09:13.333 --> 02:09:17.292
Let us go home.

02:09:47.958 --> 02:09:49.167
He's coming!

02:09:52.583 --> 02:09:53.750
Soft?

02:09:54.458 --> 02:09:56.333
Too firm.

02:09:57.167 --> 02:09:58.125
Too firm.

02:09:59.917 --> 02:10:01.375
-Silk.
-Good.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:08.917
Noa.

02:10:30.667 --> 02:10:32.292
I came to say goodbye.

02:10:41.542 --> 02:10:43.542
Proximus was right.

02:10:44.667 --> 02:10:48.458
Humans will never give up.

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:53.625
Not until you claim all things…

02:10:53.792 --> 02:10:55.333
for yourselves.

02:10:56.417 --> 02:10:57.792
It was ours.

02:10:58.625 --> 02:11:01.083
That silo was a human place…

02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:03.042
with human things and human ideas.

02:11:03.208 --> 02:11:04.708
It was not meant for apes.

02:11:04.875 --> 02:11:07.500
What is for apes?

02:11:09.583 --> 02:11:11.708
Should we go back to silence?

02:11:13.708 --> 02:11:16.250
We will rebuild our home.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.167
Better.

02:11:19.667 --> 02:11:20.875
Stronger.

02:11:21.833 --> 02:11:24.125
From what we have learned.

02:11:34.375 --> 02:11:36.625
If Raka were here…

02:11:38.083 --> 02:11:40.542
he would tell us his Caesar…

02:11:41.458 --> 02:11:43.417
had much to say on this.

02:11:48.292 --> 02:11:50.625
Was he right?

02:11:57.042 --> 02:12:02.792
Can ape and human live together?

02:12:13.792 --> 02:12:15.125
I don't know.

02:12:29.333 --> 02:12:31.375
Important.

02:13:20.375 --> 02:13:22.042
See you soon.

02:14:39.417 --> 02:14:40.333
Come.

02:14:46.125 --> 02:14:47.750
Rescaling back down to 20.

02:14:48.042 --> 02:14:50.292
New latitude point, 2.722.

02:14:50.458 --> 02:14:51.500
Copy that. Spooling up.

02:14:51.667 --> 02:14:52.792
Let me know
what that distribution looks like.

02:14:52.958 --> 02:14:53.833
Let's get over here.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.542
-Readings have been confirmed.
-Link is ready!

02:14:55.708 --> 02:14:56.667
Pulling up now.

02:15:42.208 --> 02:15:43.625
Hello.

02:15:44.417 --> 02:15:45.792
Is anyone there?

02:15:45.958 --> 02:15:47.167
Come on.

02:15:47.333 --> 02:15:48.625
Do you hear me?

02:15:51.458 --> 02:15:52.583
Yes, hello?

02:15:53.042 --> 02:15:55.083
This is Fort Wayne, Indiana. We read you!

02:15:56.417 --> 02:15:57.875
It's good to hear another voice out there.

02:15:58.833 --> 02:16:00.708
Tell me where you are.
What's your location?
