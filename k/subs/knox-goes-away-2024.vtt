WEBVTT

02:09.172 --> 02:10.782
Cassie, can I have some coffee?

02:10.782 --> 02:11.870
Okay.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.528
You heard about this broad
out in Weasley?

02:17.528 --> 02:21.706
Oh, old-school,
newspaper, I like it.

02:21.706 --> 02:24.361
Yeah... You know, the news
does come on your phone now,

02:24.361 --> 02:25.754
it's a new thing.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.843
Says the man
with ten thousand books.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.671
Hmm. Thank you.

02:29.671 --> 02:32.891
Makes her husband breakfast,
for 35 years.

02:32.891 --> 02:36.852
One day, she starts putting
a little bit of antifreeze

02:36.852 --> 02:38.810
on his orange juice
every morning.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.638
Why, was he cold?

02:42.858 --> 02:45.513
What we got here?

02:45.513 --> 02:49.691
Oh... "Empiricism
and the Philosophy of Mind".

02:49.691 --> 02:51.693
Bunch of crock.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.871
Wilfrid Sellars wrote this?

02:55.871 --> 02:59.570
Yeah, interesting guy.
You know Wilfrid Sellars?

02:59.570 --> 03:01.224
No, but I know Peter Sellars.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.095
Okay...

03:05.924 --> 03:08.579
It took this guy eight months
to die from the antifreeze.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.626
That's dedication.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.845
You gotta give her points
for tenacity.

03:13.845 --> 03:16.326
Come on. Eight months?

03:16.326 --> 03:18.633
Can you imagine hating
anyone that much?

03:18.633 --> 03:21.940
Honestly? I can think
of a few candidates, yeah.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.115
How did they catch her?

03:23.115 --> 03:25.248
Mmm... doesn't say.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.816
Maybe they...

03:27.816 --> 03:29.252
Maybe when they tried
to embalm the guy,

03:29.252 --> 03:31.254
the formaldehyde wouldn't set.

03:31.254 --> 03:34.257
"I pumped two barrels
of that shit into him

03:34.257 --> 03:35.911
and it keeps leaking out."

03:35.911 --> 03:37.782
Put him in the deep freeze
and he's still warm.

03:37.782 --> 03:41.264
That's good, that's good.

03:41.264 --> 03:44.180
- Thank you.
- Hi there, Cassie.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.139
Cassie, can I get a coffee?

03:47.139 --> 03:48.228
Already got you.

03:49.664 --> 03:52.841
I guess I need it.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.672
You're such a skinny dude.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.152
Where you put all that?

04:00.152 --> 04:03.112
My old man said I have
a hollow cock.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.983
Really?

04:04.983 --> 04:07.943
Your father said that,
"hollow cock". Interesting.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.032
Yeah, he's a philosopher, too.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.302
I'm going to go
right to the airport from here.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.783
I have to go out of town
for a couple of days.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.480
- You? What for?
- Yeah.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.613
Personal stuff, no big deal.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.831
I'll be back the day
after tomorrow.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.703
Actually, I'll be back tomorrow.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.532
- Personal?
- Yeah.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.011
Good.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.319
Because if Jericho found out
you went out of town on a job...

04:36.319 --> 04:38.234
Give me a little credit,
I don't have a death wish.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.975
Then why are you even going?

04:39.975 --> 04:42.238
Like I said, personal.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.848
No big deal.

04:43.848 --> 04:46.503
I'll be back tomorrow.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.939
Okay.
Yeah.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.300
Are you okay?

05:01.388 --> 05:03.041
Good.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.304
Okay...

05:06.436 --> 05:07.959
I'm going to get the check.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.266
The check? We just got
the plate of food.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.050
I know but I...

05:12.050 --> 05:13.530
don't want to be late,
I have to get to the airport.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.532
You got five minutes
to eat some food.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.012
Hurry up,
take five minutes.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.274
Jesus Christ...

05:20.972 --> 05:23.932
All right, anything
comes up, call me.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.455
What the hell?

05:25.455 --> 05:27.283
When did you get the new car?

05:27.283 --> 05:30.068
Oh... Eh... Oh.

05:33.594 --> 05:36.553
So, you're not even going to
tell me where you're going now.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.381
I'll tell you when I come back.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.215
Apple.

05:48.783 --> 05:49.827
Dog.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.359
Ehm...

06:06.453 --> 06:07.497
Car.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.056
How are you today?

06:46.275 --> 06:49.191
Well... you tell me.

06:49.191 --> 06:53.456
My initial suspicions
were incorrect.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.979
It's not Alzheimer's.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.505
Okay.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.898
What is it?

07:00.898 --> 07:02.334
You're suffering
from a condition

07:02.334 --> 07:04.249
known as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

07:04.249 --> 07:07.601
It presents initially in much
the same way as Alzheimer's.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.037
So, what's the difference?

07:09.037 --> 07:10.255
Speed of progression.

07:13.345 --> 07:17.088
I'm guessing...
you don't mean it's slower.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.136
In your case,
it's incredibly fast.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.273
What's the treatment?

07:28.273 --> 07:29.405
There's no treatment.

07:32.669 --> 07:36.064
The thing you have to
remember about dementia

07:36.064 --> 07:38.719
is the thought-feeling
connection.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.938
You have a thought,
creates a feeling.

07:40.938 --> 07:44.159
You lose a thought,
you're left with a feeling.

07:44.159 --> 07:47.249
So, you'll be going along and...

07:47.249 --> 07:49.033
all of a sudden,

07:49.033 --> 07:51.253
you'll be unreasonably happy
and you won't know why.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.561
Or you'll have
this wave of depression

07:54.561 --> 07:56.563
and you won't know why.

07:56.563 --> 08:00.392
You'll find yourself...
forgetting people,

08:00.392 --> 08:03.700
even those you have
a connection with.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.659
You'll become displaced
in time and space...

08:15.277 --> 08:16.887
Right now, you're mostly lucid

08:16.887 --> 08:20.064
with small patches of confusion
and mental lapse.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.805
So, then it'll reverse.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.938
The moments of lucidity
will become the exception

08:23.938 --> 08:25.896
and eventually,
go away altogether.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.985
How much time do I have?

08:27.985 --> 08:29.334
It's progressing
more aggressively

08:29.334 --> 08:30.422
than I would like...

08:30.422 --> 08:31.859
- Uhm...
- How much time?

08:33.774 --> 08:38.779
You're looking at weeks,
not months.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.520
If you have any arrangements
to make,

08:40.520 --> 08:44.132
I suggest you do so
as quickly as possible.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.613
Do you have family
that can take care of you?

08:49.659 --> 08:52.227
None that would.
All right.

08:52.227 --> 08:56.318
Then, I suggest you look
into care facilities.

08:58.886 --> 09:02.063
This is a very good place...

09:02.063 --> 09:03.586
in your area.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.424
I'm sorry.

09:15.424 --> 09:18.253
That's okay, doc.

09:18.253 --> 09:20.995
Even if I hated you
for telling me,

09:20.995 --> 09:22.736
I'd forget soon enough.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.196
<i>What do you want to know?</i>

09:48.544 --> 09:50.241
<i>I think you have secrets</i>

09:50.241 --> 09:51.939
<i>you don't want to tell me</i>.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.376
Secrets are secrets,
so I can't tell you.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.033
I finished
the last book you lent me.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.557
Oh, yeah?

10:01.557 --> 10:04.516
What did you think?

10:04.516 --> 10:07.128
I liked it but
the end was stupid.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.783
Really?

10:09.783 --> 10:11.349
He just lets them chop off
his head

10:11.349 --> 10:13.656
while the other guy walks away?

10:13.656 --> 10:15.527
Well, see...

10:15.527 --> 10:19.662
His whole character arc leads
to that moment. You know?

10:20.707 --> 10:24.798
It's a... sacrifice
for the greater good, you know?

10:24.798 --> 10:27.844
Mmm...
like the end of "Casablanca"?

10:27.844 --> 10:29.759
Yeah, like the end
of "Casablanca," exactly.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.283
It was bullshit, too.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.372
Rick would take the girl
10 times out of 10.

10:34.372 --> 10:38.115
"A far, far better thing"
my ass.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.769
Wow.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.380
Is everyone from Kraków
that cynical?

10:42.380 --> 10:44.774
I'm not cynical, I'm realistic.

10:47.472 --> 10:50.040
What day is it?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.564
- Thursday?
- No, no, I mean...

10:52.564 --> 10:54.001
I mean what date.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.567
The fifth, does that
mean something?

10:57.700 --> 11:00.355
It's my son's birthday,

11:00.355 --> 11:04.576
who hasn't spoken with me
many, many years.

11:08.711 --> 11:11.758
Why does he hate you so much?

11:11.758 --> 11:17.067
I'm what the Science journals
refer to as a "lousy father."

11:17.067 --> 11:18.895
Mmm...

11:18.895 --> 11:20.897
He found out
what I did for a living.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.420
Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.987
What do you do
for a living?

11:23.987 --> 11:25.685
I work for the IRS.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.687
Just like that, I hate you too.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.038
I've been coming here

11:31.038 --> 11:34.215
once a week for almost...
four years

11:34.215 --> 11:37.871
and that's the first thing
you've said about yourself.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.350
What do you want to know?

11:39.350 --> 11:41.352
I'll tell you anything,
just ask me.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.833
Is that your real name,
Aristotle?

11:43.833 --> 11:46.314
No, it's a nickname

11:46.314 --> 11:48.142
the guys in my platoon gave me,

11:48.142 --> 11:49.752
I was in the first Gulf War

11:49.752 --> 11:51.145
and I used to read a lot
of books,

11:51.145 --> 11:53.538
like philosophy
and... like that.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.156
I got to go.

12:14.037 --> 12:17.737
The thing with your son
explains a lot, though.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.782
What do you mean?

12:19.782 --> 12:21.001
You know how they say

12:21.001 --> 12:22.916
haunted houses have cold spots?

12:24.526 --> 12:26.223
Stand in certain areas,

12:26.223 --> 12:29.009
and a chill goes down your spine
like an artic breeze.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.054
What the hell
you're talking about?

12:31.054 --> 12:32.447
That's what's like here.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.318
You walk in the door
and you feel it.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.494
Only it isn't a ghost.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.931
What is it?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.802
Loneliness.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.415
See you next Thursday,
not really Aristotle.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.334
This guy's
a piece of work.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.596
I don't care.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.468
Human trafficker from <i>España.</i>

12:53.468 --> 12:54.991
Why do we always
have to go through this?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.776
Why do we have to
go through what?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.169
You ask me if I want to know
the details of the job

12:59.169 --> 13:00.780
and I say, "no, I really don't"

13:00.780 --> 13:02.694
and then you tell me
the details of the job

13:02.694 --> 13:04.131
and then I say, "shut up" and
we go through it again and again

13:04.131 --> 13:05.567
and we always go through

13:05.567 --> 13:06.611
the same thing
every fucking time!

13:06.611 --> 13:07.830
The question is,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.266
why don't you care
who the guy is?

13:09.266 --> 13:10.485
Ready.

13:14.924 --> 13:18.536
Hey, this could be
my last job for a while.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.930
What the fuck is going on, John?

13:20.930 --> 13:22.889
Nothing, I just need to
take care of a few things

13:22.889 --> 13:24.412
I'll clear it with Jericho.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.196
Okay, how long are you
going to be out?

13:27.589 --> 13:28.633
Hard to say.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.854
Come on. Let's go.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.029
This motherfucker sells
men for human labor,

13:33.029 --> 13:34.204
that's a thing now.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.771
Jesus Christ.

13:35.771 --> 13:36.946
I thought trafficking
was like sex shit.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.469
Same thing every time.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.731
Didn't we just go
through this at the car?

13:42.169 --> 13:45.172
Why don't you care
who the guy is?

13:45.172 --> 13:46.564
Because in ten minutes,

13:46.564 --> 13:49.916
Tommy, he's not going to
be anybody.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.221
Let's go get this done.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.495
Damn it.

16:35.864 --> 16:36.996
Hello?

16:38.780 --> 16:39.824
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.176
Well, we were...

16:43.176 --> 16:45.526
expecting only one person
to be there.

16:46.527 --> 16:47.658
We got split up.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.748
I guess he figured...

16:50.748 --> 16:52.620
I don't know,
we could cover more ground.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.016
And I heard shots...

17:01.455 --> 17:02.499
Christ, Tommy.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.591
I didn't mean to.

17:11.247 --> 17:14.033
- Knox...
- I'm sorry, Tommy.

17:23.738 --> 17:24.782
Yeah, he was.

17:27.089 --> 17:30.832
<i>Yeah. I made sure the scene
was clean and then I left.</i>

17:37.186 --> 17:38.231
Okay.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.407
Thank you.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.948
You're buying this?

17:59.948 --> 18:02.037
Five bullets, three victims?

18:02.037 --> 18:04.735
Had to happen fast.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.868
Are you thinking
there's a third shooter?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.391
There's no evidence of that.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.657
Growing up, I hated my mother.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.746
Is that right?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.792
She was a stereotype,
overbearing,

18:17.792 --> 18:20.055
Asian, hellicopter mom.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.144
An "A" minus meant
I didn't have any pride.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.885
My mother was a drunk, so...

18:23.885 --> 18:25.539
- This is about me.
- Sorry.

18:25.539 --> 18:28.455
She hates my chosen profession
but, ironically,

18:28.455 --> 18:31.849
made me a good detective.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.242
Realizing her wanting me

18:33.242 --> 18:34.852
to excel was about her
and not me,

18:36.245 --> 18:38.378
gave me my first lesson
in motive.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.989
She taught me that the details
were important.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.382
The answers lie

18:42.382 --> 18:43.818
in the little things
other people,

18:43.818 --> 18:45.863
she meant white people, overlook.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.388
With all due respect,
is this going somewhere?

18:48.388 --> 18:50.259
There's water
all over the floor.

18:50.259 --> 18:53.132
That means the shower was on
when the curtain came down.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.221
Okay.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.658
- So?
- So,

18:57.658 --> 18:59.355
he killed them, they killed him,

18:59.355 --> 19:01.183
all in a hurry,
bang, bang, bang.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.230
Who turned off the shower?

19:45.793 --> 19:48.230
- Hey, Knox.
- Hey.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.927
Sit down. Want a drink?

19:49.927 --> 19:53.235
Yeah. Yeah, whisky.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.020
So...

19:56.020 --> 19:59.241
you just swing by to say hello?

19:59.241 --> 20:01.200
No, closing out.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.637
I have to do it
pretty quick, too.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.334
- Quick?
- Yeah.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.206
- Jericho knows?
- He can't.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.383
That makes it tough.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.732
Raise your commission, I guess.

20:13.864 --> 20:18.086
I'm uh... I'm going away.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.175
For good this time.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.786
And I don't want this
blowing back on Jericho.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.048
What happened?

20:24.048 --> 20:25.789
A job went South.

20:25.789 --> 20:29.532
I set the scene out to buy
myself some time but...

20:29.532 --> 20:32.535
- It's not going to last long.
- I'm sure about that.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.581
Three people,

20:34.581 --> 20:36.235
all shot each other
with the same gun.

20:37.497 --> 20:38.802
Yeah, that's not good.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.284
My gun.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.633
- That's worse.
- Yeah.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.637
So time is of the essence.
How do you have your capital.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.335
Mostly cash.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.076
Got some paintings
you got to sell. Some stones.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.688
- That's simple enough.
- Yeah.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.302
A list of three people.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.435
All three, equal shares.

21:02.435 --> 21:05.046
Nothing in here
for Muncie's family?

21:05.046 --> 21:06.526
Muncie didn't have anybody.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.922
I can't have any of this
touch those people.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.576
This money has to be clean.

21:16.536 --> 21:20.061
Gather your assets,
I'll set it up.

21:20.061 --> 21:21.410
A couple of days.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.107
Hey, this stays
between you and me.

21:23.107 --> 21:27.068
Yeah, and I'm going to tell who?

21:27.068 --> 21:28.983
All right.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.245
All right, thanks.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.796
What's up?

21:59.796 --> 22:01.537
This key doesn't work
on the... uh...

22:03.234 --> 22:05.498
- The thing, the...
- Lock?

22:05.498 --> 22:07.804
- Lock, yeah.
- All right.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.458
Yeah, the green ones,

22:09.458 --> 22:10.590
they go to our other facility,
out in Van Nuys.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.678
Okay.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.203
Hey, could you do me a favor?

22:15.203 --> 22:18.032
Could you... uh... write down
the number...

22:18.032 --> 22:19.599
- The address?
- The address.

22:19.599 --> 22:20.861
Yeah, got you.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.434
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

23:12.434 --> 23:15.176
just to show up like this,
I should've called.

23:15.176 --> 23:18.701
I didn't mean to ambush you,
I'm sorry.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.137
Do I know you?

23:23.140 --> 23:26.230
Okay, I guess I deserve that.

23:26.230 --> 23:30.278
You got to know I wouldn't
be here unless I was desperate.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.585
Okay? I need your help.

23:35.326 --> 23:38.286
Dad, could you please
just talk to me?

23:38.286 --> 23:39.374
Dad.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.421
Miles... yeah.

23:44.248 --> 23:47.817
Sure, Miles.
Come here. Come on in.

23:47.817 --> 23:52.082
Thank you, I just...

23:52.082 --> 23:55.216
Have a seat.

24:04.181 --> 24:08.447
No, no, no, I'm... I'm sober.
Nine years.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.934
That's your blood?

24:17.934 --> 24:21.938
Yeah, my hand is... Uhm...

24:21.938 --> 24:25.159
I cut it in a...

24:25.159 --> 24:27.857
This is my blood
and that's someone else's.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.598
Holy fuck!

24:35.474 --> 24:36.649
I fucked up.

24:38.738 --> 24:41.262
I fucked up really bad.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.656
Okay... okay.

24:43.656 --> 24:47.050
Okay, take it easy.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.922
Catch your breath.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.924
Tell me what happened.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.103
I killed someone.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.498
Did they deserve killing?

25:03.589 --> 25:05.765
Okay, start there.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.856
Okay.

25:09.856 --> 25:13.120
You have
a granddaughter.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.776
- Kaylee.
- How did you know about her?

25:16.776 --> 25:19.213
Your mother told me,
right after she was born.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.696
Yeah. Yeah, Kaylee.

25:23.696 --> 25:26.916
What is she, like 12? 13?

25:26.916 --> 25:28.918
She's 16.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.529
Here...

25:35.708 --> 25:38.232
- Cute kid.
- Yeah.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.320
She's a kid.

25:42.366 --> 25:43.846
And she met this guy...

25:45.500 --> 25:47.241
Online. This...

25:47.241 --> 25:49.852
piece of shit!

25:49.852 --> 25:51.854
The guy was 32 years old.

25:51.854 --> 25:56.380
This son of a bitch
gets her pregnant.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.079
She's 16 years old,
she's my little girl.

25:59.079 --> 26:03.126
So, I go over
to his house, you know?

26:03.126 --> 26:06.216
I was just going to put
the fear of God on him.

26:06.216 --> 26:10.046
And I show up and he's...

26:10.046 --> 26:12.440
more than I expected. Okay?

26:15.530 --> 26:18.359
He wouldn't shut up.
Just kept talking,

26:18.359 --> 26:21.057
and talking and talking
about my fucking daughter.

26:21.057 --> 26:23.233
Like, saying shit
about her, like...

26:23.233 --> 26:25.148
"she loves it,"
"She wanted more."

26:25.148 --> 26:29.370
Called her "ripe."
Called her ripe, dad!

26:29.370 --> 26:33.330
Fuck! I just lost it.

26:33.330 --> 26:36.420
So I grabbed a knife
and I sho...

26:36.420 --> 26:38.509
I shoved it into his neck.

26:41.643 --> 26:44.167
And I stabbed him.

26:44.167 --> 26:47.127
I just... couldn't stop.

26:49.346 --> 26:50.565
I didn't care.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.134
Because I wasn't even
in the room, I was...

27:02.708 --> 27:03.839
Did you bury this guy?

27:04.971 --> 27:06.320
Did I bury him?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.148
Yeah.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.541
No, why?

27:10.541 --> 27:12.239
Because if you did, I was
going to dig him up

27:12.239 --> 27:13.414
and kill him again.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.248
Oh, my God...

27:22.858 --> 27:24.077
So, why did you come to me?

27:28.124 --> 27:30.344
Are you kidding?

27:31.867 --> 27:34.391
Well, I mean...

27:34.391 --> 27:36.611
You're the only person
I know that can... I...

27:36.611 --> 27:38.657
This isn't my world.

27:38.657 --> 27:43.009
- I don't know how to...
- Get rid of a body.

27:43.009 --> 27:46.882
I never asked you
for anything in my life.

27:46.882 --> 27:51.844
Okay? And I'm here because
I had nowhere else to go.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.933
Now you need me.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.370
Yeah, that's what
this is, I'm desperate.

27:56.370 --> 27:59.678
Okay? I'm so fucking desperate
that I'm here, at your house,

27:59.678 --> 28:01.201
asking you for help.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.506
Now, are you
going to help me or not?

28:13.256 --> 28:14.736
Where's the murder weapon?

28:40.849 --> 28:42.459
Here.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.331
Put your clothes
in that plastic bag,

28:44.331 --> 28:46.725
then take a shower
and scrub down everything.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.944
Underneath the fingernails,
clean everything.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.772
Then, afterwards,
I'm going to wrap and clean

28:50.772 --> 28:52.339
that hand of yours.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.602
- Then what?
- Then?

28:54.602 --> 28:56.038
You go home to your wife

28:56.038 --> 28:59.694
and you never
mention this again.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.870
My whole life, I never
asked you for anything.

29:01.870 --> 29:05.178
Yeah, you said that already.

29:05.178 --> 29:09.748
Here, use that. I'm going to
need those boxers, too.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.885
Hey, where's the body?

30:29.131 --> 30:31.568
Write it down. Write it down.

34:16.271 --> 34:17.577
There you are.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.624
What are you doing?

34:23.104 --> 34:24.105
Nothing.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.545
I talked to her.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.331
What did she say?

34:34.811 --> 34:37.031
She wants you to take her.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.076
What?

34:39.468 --> 34:41.514
Well, I assumed this would be...

34:41.514 --> 34:44.125
you know, like,
a mother-daughter thing.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.649
Well, apparently it isn't.

34:48.260 --> 34:49.913
What happened to your hand?

34:59.401 --> 35:00.750
I have to tell you something.

35:10.543 --> 35:11.935
All right, what do we got?

35:11.935 --> 35:14.416
Elian Zubiri, out of Barcelona.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.070
We're waiting
for the Interpol jacket

35:16.070 --> 35:18.899
but safe to say he wasn't
a model citizen.

35:18.899 --> 35:21.336
The woman was local,
Annette Elmora.

35:21.336 --> 35:22.816
Yeah, we're thinking
maybe he picked her up

35:22.816 --> 35:24.383
at a club or something.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.733
You know, wrong place-wrong time
kind of thing.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.909
Victim number three is
where it gets interesting.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.302
Meet Thomas Muncie,

35:30.302 --> 35:31.999
suspected hitter for Jericho.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.349
Conspicuously missing
from the carnage,

35:34.349 --> 35:36.830
this man, John Knox.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.832
Traffic cam shot this
six blocks away

35:38.832 --> 35:40.225
around the time of death.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.401
Facial recognition flagged him.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.619
That could just be
a driver, though.

35:43.619 --> 35:44.968
We're sure this guy's a driver?

35:44.968 --> 35:47.145
What's his jacket say?

35:47.145 --> 35:49.495
Not much. He did a six-year
stretch for tax evasion

35:49.495 --> 35:51.714
and that's only because
someone ratted them out.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.673
Other than that
and his service record,

35:53.673 --> 35:55.414
there's nothing on him.

35:55.414 --> 35:56.980
Which means, whatever
this guy does for a living,

35:56.980 --> 35:58.112
he's pretty good at it.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.505
Smart, too.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.333
According to the tax
auditor's notes,

36:01.333 --> 36:03.378
John Knox holds two PhDs.

36:03.378 --> 36:06.512
One in English Lit
and one in US History.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.775
Even taught in Bucknell
a couple of years.

36:08.775 --> 36:11.473
And we're thinking this guy
kills people for a living?

36:11.473 --> 36:13.127
Why?

36:13.127 --> 36:15.477
Hopefully, we'll get
to ask him ourselves.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.218
What branch of service
was he in?

36:17.218 --> 36:20.526
Army. He was a deep
reconnaissance officer.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.963
Remind me what that is again?

36:22.963 --> 36:24.443
Someone who goes off alone

36:24.443 --> 36:26.401
behind enemy lines
for weeks at a time.

36:26.401 --> 36:28.011
Then, maybe we just
bring him in

36:28.011 --> 36:29.448
as a cooperating witness.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.711
Friend-of-the-victim
kind of thing.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.930
He might slip up
and give us something.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.845
Does he seem like someone
who makes mistakes?

36:35.845 --> 36:39.197
Hey, boss, check your texts.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.202
Another body.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.899
And now, we got three
on my board already.

36:45.899 --> 36:47.988
Victim's Aryan Brotherhood.

36:47.988 --> 36:50.338
That's your métier.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.253
Métier? Really?

37:00.653 --> 37:02.394
- John Knox.
- Hey!

37:02.394 --> 37:04.265
- Hi.
- Is he upstairs?

37:04.265 --> 37:06.006
Yeah. I'm supposed to think
he's doing the books.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.400
- What's he really doing?
- Watching TV.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.619
- I married a little boy.
- Yeah.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.534
Well, he married up,
that's for sure.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.325
Xavier! Coming up.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.209
Look at this skinny
son of a bitch.

37:35.209 --> 37:39.344
They rescued him
from a big cat sanctuary.

37:39.344 --> 37:42.260
Locals toss him stray dogs
in a cave

37:42.260 --> 37:44.305
so he can have something to eat.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.438
Kind of reminds me of you.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.701
You know, when I first found you
after your war.

37:50.659 --> 37:51.921
I never ate a dog.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.752
What's this,
grocery list?

37:56.752 --> 37:59.277
It's a plan,
and I'm going to need your help.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.408
Just read it.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.892
Hey, Ludmilla looks good.

38:07.328 --> 38:10.723
She still hasn't realized

38:10.723 --> 38:13.203
what a mistake she made
marrying me.

38:13.203 --> 38:15.423
You're learning any Russian?

38:15.423 --> 38:18.861
Just the stuff she says
I need to know.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.429
"Yes, dear." "Please."

38:21.429 --> 38:22.735
All the essentials.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.349
Okay, lay it on me.

38:30.133 --> 38:31.918
Stabbed at least 17 times.

38:33.963 --> 38:35.400
I put time of death between

38:35.400 --> 38:36.836
3:00 and 8:00 p.m.
yesterday afternoon.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.141
I'll get a more precise
time frame

38:38.141 --> 38:39.360
when I get him to the shop.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.536
- All right.
- Yeah.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.756
Thanks, bro.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.975
There's no murder weapon yet,

38:45.975 --> 38:48.500
but there's a knife missing
from that kitchen block.

38:48.500 --> 38:51.067
I mean, it doesn't even look
like anything was stolen.

38:51.067 --> 38:52.634
He's got an expensive watch
on his wrist,

38:52.634 --> 38:55.115
he's got a wallet
full of large bills...

38:55.115 --> 38:56.725
I know this racist
piece of crap.

38:56.725 --> 38:59.075
His name is Andrew Palmer.

38:59.075 --> 39:00.686
He moves cash around

39:00.686 --> 39:02.470
for the Aryan Brotherhood
but... he's a cog.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.125
- Not a shot caller.
- So, he winds up dead.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.388
There's no big mystery there.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.303
But he also did a stretch
a few years back

39:09.303 --> 39:10.913
for kiddie porn.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.699
And this... this doesn't look
like business.

39:13.699 --> 39:15.962
This looks personal.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.311
Detective, gate guard out
front says

39:17.311 --> 39:18.530
he was knocked out
last night.

39:19.835 --> 39:20.880
I got this.

39:23.012 --> 39:26.102
Bag the victim's computers,
any flash drives and discs.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.409
- What are we looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.193
Oh, and see if you can find
his phone,

39:30.193 --> 39:31.369
he didn't have it on him.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.413
Got it.

39:39.072 --> 39:41.074
So, how long have you known?

39:41.074 --> 39:42.902
Uh... not long.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.775
Doc says this thing
moves pretty fast.

39:46.775 --> 39:49.169
Oh, Jesus, Knox.

39:49.169 --> 39:52.172
I can't think of anything worse.

39:52.172 --> 39:54.130
Except maybe your pecker
stops working.

39:54.130 --> 40:00.354
Actually, I'm looking forward
to forgetting some things.

40:00.354 --> 40:05.446
Muncie... Christ.
I can't imagine what the--

40:05.446 --> 40:07.317
That's like me shooting you.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.711
I don't even remember
doing it. I mean, I know...

40:09.711 --> 40:13.106
I know I did it but I have
no recollection of the event.

40:13.106 --> 40:15.021
Well, count your blessings.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.763
This is a radical plan.

40:17.763 --> 40:20.809
It's the only way
I can figure it.

40:20.809 --> 40:24.726
This kid's DNA is
all over the place.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.249
He actually bled on the guy,

40:26.249 --> 40:28.295
he's got his fingerprints
everywhere.

40:28.295 --> 40:31.080
He might as well just
signed off on the job.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.082
Still, if you don't
pull this off,

40:33.082 --> 40:37.347
you're both fucked.
Yeah.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.828
- I'm fucked either way.
- That's true.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.440
That's why I'm asking you
to help me.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.529
Look, just check in with me.

40:44.529 --> 40:47.923
Just check in with me
now and then. You know?

40:47.923 --> 40:50.926
- Make sure I'm on point.
- Yeah, of course, sure.

40:50.926 --> 40:56.236
Just so you don't ever thing
this stupid plan is my idea.

40:56.236 --> 40:57.890
I'm sure you'll remind me.

41:00.283 --> 41:01.981
You want to know
the funny thing?

41:01.981 --> 41:04.505
Let's say I pull this thing off,

41:04.505 --> 41:06.855
I won't even know
if I did it or not.

41:06.855 --> 41:09.205
It's encouraging.

41:09.205 --> 41:11.947
This plan is
precision work, man.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.819
- One hair out of place--
- Oh, I know.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.562
I know.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.868
I know I could pull this off.

41:19.868 --> 41:21.174
The question is, can you?

41:22.610 --> 41:25.526
So, you didn't see his face,
didn't see his height, nothing?

41:25.526 --> 41:26.614
- No.
- Okay.

41:26.614 --> 41:27.920
All right, thank you.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.359
Beautiful day.

41:32.359 --> 41:34.056
Sure.

41:34.056 --> 41:35.493
What did you get?

41:35.493 --> 41:36.581
Don't suppose he can
ID our killer.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.147
No, he was attacked from behind.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.714
He didn't see anything.

41:39.714 --> 41:41.803
Happened a little before
three in the morning.

41:41.803 --> 41:43.196
Doesn't fit the timeline.

41:43.196 --> 41:45.633
M.E. said he was killed
before 8:00 p.m.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.983
So you think the attack
on the guard is unrelated?

41:47.983 --> 41:50.595
It's related, I'm just...
not sure how, yet.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.901
They get anything off
these security cameras?

41:52.901 --> 41:54.512
Well, that part is weird.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.688
They feed into a DVR
in the utility closet.

41:56.688 --> 41:59.299
- There's no hard drive.
- You mean it doesn't work?

41:59.299 --> 42:01.606
No, I mean the tech
couldn't get playback

42:01.606 --> 42:02.781
so we opened up the DVR
and looked inside,

42:02.781 --> 42:04.173
no hard drive.

42:04.173 --> 42:05.435
Found his phone.

42:05.435 --> 42:07.220
Can't open it, though.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.787
It's got one of those facial
recognition locks on it.

42:08.787 --> 42:12.181
- Okay, head back inside.
- Okay.

42:12.181 --> 42:13.705
What am I looking for?

42:13.705 --> 42:15.837
His face. I assume
that's where it is...

42:17.056 --> 42:18.100
Right.

43:16.506 --> 43:17.638
Did you forget I was coming?

43:18.857 --> 43:20.554
Oh... no, no.

43:29.171 --> 43:30.216
How are you?

43:33.567 --> 43:36.265
Good. I'm...

43:36.265 --> 43:38.180
kind of knotted up.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.442
That's why I'm here.

43:42.750 --> 43:45.187
I finished the book.

43:45.187 --> 43:48.669
It was... better but I knew
he was going to die in the end.

43:48.669 --> 43:50.540
He kind of had to.

43:50.540 --> 43:52.630
I'll find you another one here.

43:56.198 --> 43:57.330
This is your ex?

43:59.811 --> 44:01.856
Yeah.

44:01.856 --> 44:05.468
- Well, she's gorgeous.
- Yeah.

44:05.468 --> 44:08.428
Hey...

44:08.428 --> 44:13.215
put that down--

44:13.215 --> 44:14.652
Why don't I get ready?

44:20.440 --> 44:21.571
Fuck me.

44:41.504 --> 44:45.247
- These paintings are all real?
- Yeah.

44:45.247 --> 44:48.990
- It's safer than cash.
- Are they worth a lot?

44:48.990 --> 44:52.864
- Why do you have them?
- Part of my cashing-out process.

44:52.864 --> 44:54.126
What?

44:57.259 --> 45:01.133
- What do you mean "cashing out"?
- Forget I said it. Forget it.

45:02.612 --> 45:04.353
Did you find me something?

45:08.183 --> 45:11.404
Hello? You picked me
another book?

45:13.058 --> 45:14.624
You want a book?

45:14.624 --> 45:18.933
Knox, are you having
a stroke or something?

45:18.933 --> 45:21.762
- Maybe you should sit down?
- You know what? Maybe...

45:23.895 --> 45:25.287
Maybe it's better
if you just go.

45:27.855 --> 45:29.335
Good idea.

45:59.669 --> 46:01.715
Sorry.

46:01.715 --> 46:05.545
I just got a...
Got a thing I got to do.

46:05.545 --> 46:08.722
- Same time next week?
- Yeah.

46:10.202 --> 46:11.812
Yeah, you bet, next week.

46:11.812 --> 46:13.727
Are you sure you're
going to be okay?

46:13.727 --> 46:14.815
Never better.

46:51.765 --> 46:53.332
Here.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.291
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:56.291 --> 46:59.468
We have an appointment.
Last name's Knox.

46:59.468 --> 47:01.731
Okay. All right, here it is.

47:01.731 --> 47:03.864
You must be Kaylee. And you are?

47:03.864 --> 47:06.736
I'm the father...
Her father, not the...

47:06.736 --> 47:08.956
- I'm her dad.
- Okay, dad.

47:08.956 --> 47:12.220
See, sign here.
Initial here, here and here.

47:12.220 --> 47:13.787
Before we do the procedure,

47:13.787 --> 47:15.833
the law says we have to
ask you a few questions.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.182
Not about the father
of the child

47:17.182 --> 47:18.923
or anything like that,

47:18.923 --> 47:21.012
just to make sure
that <i>you</i> want to be here.

47:21.012 --> 47:22.840
That'd be okay?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.624
I guess so.

47:24.624 --> 47:25.712
Good.

47:26.800 --> 47:29.281
Now it's your turn.

47:29.281 --> 47:30.891
I need a couple of signatures
from you,

47:30.891 --> 47:33.111
starting here on the consent
form.

47:40.074 --> 47:41.336
All right,
guys, have a sit.

47:41.336 --> 47:42.468
Thank you.

47:49.997 --> 47:51.433
<i>Are you having</i>

47:51.433 --> 47:53.218
<i>a stroke of something?</i>

48:05.578 --> 48:06.927
Xavier, hey.

48:06.927 --> 48:09.364
I'm calling to make sure
you're on track.

48:09.364 --> 48:13.934
- On track with what?
- Your cockamamie plan is what.

48:13.934 --> 48:16.328
You got your notepad?

48:16.328 --> 48:17.851
Yeah.

48:19.592 --> 48:21.637
Yeah, I'm on track,
don't worry about it.

48:21.637 --> 48:22.900
He says "don't worry."

48:23.988 --> 48:27.208
Do me a favor,
unlock your phone.

48:27.208 --> 48:29.732
<i>Permanently, no more passcode.</i>

48:29.732 --> 48:32.953
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Why?

48:32.953 --> 48:37.305
Well, what if you need help
and you can't remember the code.

48:37.305 --> 48:40.395
Right... right, okay.

48:40.395 --> 48:42.006
Yeah, got it.

48:46.706 --> 48:50.928
- You're there?
- Huh? Yeah.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.191
I feel like I'm getting worse
every hour.

48:56.890 --> 48:58.370
I'm running out of time.

48:58.370 --> 49:02.635
So, stop wasting it
talking to me. Okay?

50:18.754 --> 50:21.061
What?
I'm in the middle of dinner.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.238
It's not even 4:30.

50:24.238 --> 50:25.718
Oh, I'm almost 90.

50:25.718 --> 50:27.502
Dinner time is
very important to me.

50:27.502 --> 50:29.330
What's up?

50:29.330 --> 50:31.767
<i>Yeah, I'm looking at
some kind of locker key.</i>

50:31.767 --> 50:34.031
<i>Do you know where that's from?</i>

50:34.031 --> 50:35.554
<i>You never confided</i>

50:35.554 --> 50:36.642
<i>in me where you keep
all your money.</i>

50:36.642 --> 50:39.601
I'm a crook, you know?

50:39.601 --> 50:41.908
All right. Great, thanks,
I'll figure it out.

50:41.908 --> 50:43.475
Hey, wait a minute.

50:43.475 --> 50:45.216
Did you take the passcode
off your phone?

50:45.216 --> 50:47.827
Ehm... yeah, I'm going to
do that now.

50:47.827 --> 50:49.785
I'll do it right now. Okay?

50:49.785 --> 50:52.788
Thanks. Say hi to Becky from me.

50:52.788 --> 50:56.270
- Wait, who?
- <i>Becky.</i>

50:56.270 --> 50:58.751
Ehm... okay.

50:58.751 --> 51:01.188
- All right.
- How's he doing?

51:01.188 --> 51:04.539
- He just called you Becky.
- Who's this Becky?

51:04.539 --> 51:06.280
She was one of my wives.

51:06.280 --> 51:09.457
I divorced her before
you were born, baby.

51:09.457 --> 51:12.808
This business with Knox...
It's not good.

51:12.808 --> 51:15.028
No.

51:15.028 --> 51:16.203
It's not.

52:07.602 --> 52:08.647
Shit.

53:08.010 --> 53:10.709
I ordered some food,
this place has great ribs.

53:10.709 --> 53:15.061
I'm a vegan. Should we...?

53:15.061 --> 53:16.889
Should we be meeting
in public like this?

53:16.889 --> 53:18.195
No one knows us here.

53:20.458 --> 53:23.722
- How's the hand?
- Well, it...

53:23.722 --> 53:26.464
- hurts.
- If anyone asks you about it,

53:26.464 --> 53:28.074
you cut on broken glass.

53:28.074 --> 53:29.945
You were at my house,
we were having a drink.

53:29.945 --> 53:32.905
What? Why would I be
at your place?

53:32.905 --> 53:34.080
You were looking for
your old Hot Wheels,

53:34.080 --> 53:35.516
make something up.

53:39.781 --> 53:41.305
- How are you doing?
- How am I doing?

53:41.305 --> 53:42.958
Yeah, uhm...

53:44.308 --> 53:46.962
Spent the day
at the abortion clinic with...

53:46.962 --> 53:50.662
my 16-year-old daughter
so, bad, I guess.

53:50.662 --> 53:52.664
Pretty bad.

53:52.664 --> 53:56.058
Not sleeping, not eating.
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

53:56.058 --> 53:57.495
Uhm...

53:57.495 --> 53:59.366
My hair is falling out.

53:59.366 --> 54:02.021
So, I'm about to lose
my goddamn mind.

54:02.021 --> 54:05.024
Okay, okay.
You need to get a grip.

54:05.024 --> 54:06.852
I don't know how
to do this, I'm not...

54:06.852 --> 54:08.375
I'm not like you, you know?

54:10.072 --> 54:11.378
I'm not a killer.

54:16.383 --> 54:18.472
You are, though.

54:18.472 --> 54:20.779
What?

54:20.779 --> 54:23.695
A killer.

54:23.695 --> 54:26.959
Damn good one, too.
Not half-assed.

54:26.959 --> 54:30.354
I was out at the scene.
Let me put it to you this way:

54:32.443 --> 54:36.751
that wasn't what you call
a proportional response.

54:36.751 --> 54:39.363
- I lost it.
- Understandable.

54:39.363 --> 54:42.670
But now I need you
to pull it all together, okay?

54:42.670 --> 54:44.324
You're like
a walking confession.

54:44.324 --> 54:45.499
I'll try harder.

54:45.499 --> 54:48.110
No, do the opposite. Relax.

54:49.895 --> 54:50.939
Okay.

55:00.601 --> 55:01.689
Is she your only kid?

55:04.910 --> 55:10.959
We... we lost one early on,
a miscarriage.

55:11.656 --> 55:13.962
- Sorry, it's tough.
- Yeah.

55:16.225 --> 55:18.445
More on Cheryl, actually.

55:18.445 --> 55:21.056
What does she do, Cheryl?

55:21.056 --> 55:23.363
Teaches fourth grade,

55:23.363 --> 55:25.322
public school.

55:25.322 --> 55:29.238
Yeah and... kids love her.

55:29.238 --> 55:31.893
All right.
Boy, you guys are busy.

55:31.893 --> 55:34.592
Working parents,
on the go all the time.

55:34.592 --> 55:37.682
What's the typical day?

55:37.682 --> 55:41.163
Tomorrow for instance,
what would you do tomorrow?

55:41.163 --> 55:43.775
Go get breakfast somewhere

55:43.775 --> 55:45.559
and walk around
Largemouth Village

55:45.559 --> 55:48.083
and then Kaylee has
soccer and...

55:48.083 --> 55:51.086
- You now.
- Do that. Do that.

55:51.086 --> 55:53.088
- Just do that.
- Do that?

55:53.088 --> 55:56.657
Yeah.
- We can't, she's laid up in bed.

55:56.657 --> 55:59.747
Don't vary your routine,
do what you would normally do.

56:19.985 --> 56:21.639
What happened to vegan?

56:21.639 --> 56:23.554
Fuck it, I'm starving.

56:23.554 --> 56:26.426
I've been starving
for six years.

56:26.426 --> 56:30.778
You ever take the family
up to the cabin?

56:30.778 --> 56:33.955
- The hunting cabin?
- Yeah.

56:33.955 --> 56:35.435
I sold it, remember?

56:35.435 --> 56:37.481
You signed the papers
two years ago.

56:39.918 --> 56:41.267
These are so fucking good.

56:42.094 --> 56:44.401
Yeah.

56:44.401 --> 56:45.880
I remember that.
You know anything about the...

56:46.925 --> 56:48.796
about if the owners...
I mean, if they use it...

56:48.796 --> 56:50.450
full time or...

56:50.450 --> 56:51.495
part time?

56:51.495 --> 56:53.018
- The buyers?
- Yeah.

56:55.150 --> 56:57.109
Well, I'm not renting it
to them. They...

56:57.109 --> 56:58.632
I sold it to them.

56:58.632 --> 57:00.634
They bought it, they own it.
I have no...

57:00.634 --> 57:02.419
- Right.
- Why would I know what they do?

57:02.419 --> 57:03.942
Okay, listen to me.

57:06.205 --> 57:07.380
You just need to...

57:08.555 --> 57:09.904
hold it together, okay?

57:09.904 --> 57:12.559
We're almost there,
couple of days.

57:12.559 --> 57:13.647
Okay.

57:15.388 --> 57:16.433
Look at me.

57:20.349 --> 57:22.264
I need you to use my balls.

57:23.527 --> 57:25.006
What?

57:25.006 --> 57:27.661
They're gonna connect Kaylee
to the dead guy.

57:27.661 --> 57:29.533
Then they're gonna question you.

57:29.533 --> 57:31.926
If you don't think you have
the balls for it, use mine.

57:31.926 --> 57:34.929
Do whatever you think I would do
if I was on that chair.

57:36.191 --> 57:37.628
All right?

57:37.628 --> 57:38.716
What?

57:46.158 --> 57:47.681
I never hated you, you know?

57:49.640 --> 57:50.728
Well...

57:53.252 --> 57:55.123
Be understandable if you did.

57:55.123 --> 57:56.647
You were a good dad in your way.

57:58.344 --> 57:59.693
I remember a lot of good.

58:01.869 --> 58:04.785
I remember ball games.
I remember you teaching me...

58:04.785 --> 58:05.873
how to hunt.

58:07.701 --> 58:10.051
I remember you letting me
eat pancakes in the pool.

58:13.620 --> 58:16.449
I worshiped you.

58:16.449 --> 58:17.929
I wanted to be just like you.

58:21.149 --> 58:22.803
Then, you know, I found out.

58:25.458 --> 58:26.503
And I thought...

58:30.811 --> 58:31.986
What if I did?

58:37.296 --> 58:39.428
Did what?

58:39.428 --> 58:41.039
What if I wound up
just like you?

58:46.697 --> 58:47.741
And here we are.

58:52.616 --> 58:53.704
Yeah, here we are.

59:35.049 --> 59:37.922
All right... Gelfuso, you're up.

59:37.922 --> 59:41.403
Okay. Scene was
definitely staged.

59:41.403 --> 59:43.057
Ballistics says
all three victims

59:43.057 --> 59:44.711
killed with the same gun.

59:44.711 --> 59:46.974
Uh, didn't see that coming.
That's a fun one.

59:46.974 --> 59:48.541
They find the gun?
Yeah.

59:48.541 --> 59:50.935
It was the one
in shower guy's hand.

59:50.935 --> 59:52.719
Five shots total.

59:52.719 --> 59:55.504
Only prints on the gun belong
to the dead Spaniard.

59:56.157 --> 59:58.464
Anybody holding out
for a triple murder-suicide?

59:58.464 --> 01:00:00.031
That would be a neat trick.

01:00:00.031 --> 01:00:01.685
Specially the part
where he reaches out

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:03.687
and turns off the shower
after he's already dead.

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:04.905
Nice catch.
Thank you.

01:00:07.299 --> 01:00:08.909
What else?

01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:10.128
I scoured
every surveillance camera

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.738
in the area.

01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:13.261
I can't put anyone
in the house with Muncie.

01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:15.220
Least of all is
John Knox's character.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.787
We know Knox's movements?

01:00:16.787 --> 01:00:18.136
He hasn't used

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:19.616
his credit card
since the murder.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.313
Two days before them,

01:00:21.313 --> 01:00:23.968
he flies from Burbank to
San Francisco for 22 hours.

01:00:23.968 --> 01:00:25.665
Why?

01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:27.624
That part,
I haven't figured out yet.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.277
But I got him on the return
flight then he goes dark.

01:00:29.277 --> 01:00:32.280
I think it's time we had a chat
with John Knox.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.674
Go pick him up,
but bring him in voluntarily.

01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:36.458
We got nothing
to hold him as a suspect.

01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:37.634
All right.

01:03:18.229 --> 01:03:20.666
Do you know what electives
you're gonna take this year?

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.887
Did you get your syllabus?

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:26.759
Yeah, I actually ended up
getting a class with Michelles.

01:03:26.759 --> 01:03:27.847
Mhm!

01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:32.330
I got
a pick-up order for Anthony.

01:03:41.948 --> 01:03:44.429
I-I just think that it might be
too much this year.

01:03:44.429 --> 01:03:46.518
Thanks.
- Very good.

01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:47.954
I'm still gonna do soccer.
I think...

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:49.564
Hey, excuse me.
Yeah.

01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:50.652
I saw you
looking at my daughter.

01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:51.958
Do I know you?

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:53.438
No.
Hey! Oh, my God!

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:54.656
Fuck you!

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:11.673
John Knox?

01:04:11.673 --> 01:04:13.762
Johnny Law.

01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:16.896
We got something going on
we'd like to get your help with.

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:19.594
If you could come with us.
Voluntarily.

01:04:19.594 --> 01:04:20.813
Sure.

01:04:20.813 --> 01:04:22.423
Why not? It's my day off.

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:24.556
I'll grab a jacket
and I'll follow you down.

01:04:24.556 --> 01:04:26.471
Or we could follow you down.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.169
Better.

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:37.525
She's on my policy. I told you,
and I told the last person.

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.746
It was pre-approved.

01:04:40.746 --> 01:04:42.530
Her doctor faxed it in.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.924
You know, we go
through the same fuck...

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:46.970
damn thing every month.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.667
D-don't put me on hold.

01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:56.501
We got Knox set up
in Interview Two.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.636
Anything on the other case?
Homer?

01:05:01.636 --> 01:05:04.988
the prints we found don't
match anything on the system.

01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:06.380
The ME confirmed
that there were

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.078
two blood types
on the scene,

01:05:08.078 --> 01:05:09.427
but hadn't had time to run
DNA sequencing to look

01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:11.298
for a match on the second guy.

01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:17.783
It's always "guys" with you.

01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:22.179
- Eh?
- You said "the second guy."

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:23.789
You also said the gate card

01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:26.009
was grabbed from behind
by "the guy,"

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.706
even though he never saw
his attacker.

01:05:27.706 --> 01:05:29.490
It's always "guys" with you.

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:32.624
Fine. The ME has not had time
to run DNA sequencing

01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:35.453
to look for a match on the
second them, they or their.

01:05:35.453 --> 01:05:37.716
- Is that better?
- Welcome to the 21st century.

01:05:37.716 --> 01:05:39.152
Oh, my God.

01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:52.339
Detective. How can I help you?

01:05:53.427 --> 01:05:55.125
Save it for the tape.

01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:58.998
Detective Emily Ikari,

01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:02.219
interviewing potential
material witness, John Knox.

01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:05.091
Case number 52698.

01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:10.053
Interview is voluntary.
Commencing at 10:46 a.m.

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:13.186
Ah... please state your name
for the record.

01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.362
John Knox.

01:06:15.362 --> 01:06:17.234
Ah, full legal.
Need the middle name.

01:06:25.633 --> 01:06:26.939
It's not a trick question.

01:06:26.939 --> 01:06:28.636
Those come later.

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:30.812
John Henry Knox.

01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.296
Okay. I don't know
what game this is,

01:06:36.296 --> 01:06:37.471
but let's move on.

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:42.433
You said something about...

01:06:42.433 --> 01:06:44.217
me being a witness?

01:06:44.217 --> 01:06:47.525
I hope so. I'm working
on the death of your partner.

01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:50.528
- I don't have a partner.
- Not anymore.

01:06:50.528 --> 01:06:52.399
If you're referring
to Thomas Muncie,

01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:53.661
he was an acquaintance.

01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:55.446
We never did any work together.

01:06:55.446 --> 01:06:58.884
I've been over the crime scene
a dozen times. Ah...

01:06:58.884 --> 01:07:00.364
let me tell you
what I think happened.

01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:01.452
Sure.

01:07:02.366 --> 01:07:04.803
There were three dead bodies
in that room,

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:06.457
all shot with the same gun,

01:07:06.457 --> 01:07:08.328
and staged to look
like they killed each other.

01:07:09.503 --> 01:07:12.028
But... it was clumsy.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:15.292
Spontaneous. It wasn't planned.

01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:19.078
I think someone
killed Muncie by mistake

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:20.949
and tried to stage it
to cover it up.

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:27.347
Did you say Ikari?

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:29.915
Are you related to Peter Ikari?

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:34.441
That's my father.
Oh, hell.

01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:37.096
I know Pete.

01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:38.706
Get him in here.
I'll talk to him.

01:07:38.706 --> 01:07:40.186
You know my father?

01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:44.147
I just talked to him...
couple days ago.

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:46.018
He used to patrol
my neighborhood.

01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:48.977
Mr. Knox, my father is dead.

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:51.980
What?

01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:56.115
What happened?

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:58.030
He was shot in the line of duty.

01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.118
Twelve years ago.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.383
Where are you going
with all this?

01:08:11.609 --> 01:08:12.697
Look.

01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:17.005
As far
as the Muncie murder goes,

01:08:17.005 --> 01:08:18.833
I wasn't there.

01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:21.706
And if you had anything
to suggest that I was,

01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:24.883
I'd be doing this interview
in a jumpsuit right now.

01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:27.799
So, as far as you're concerned,

01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:29.757
I'm Schrodinger's murderer.

01:08:29.757 --> 01:08:30.845
Schro-what now?

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:32.934
At this moment...

01:08:35.763 --> 01:08:40.159
I both did
and did not kill Muncie.

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:42.248
And with that,
I'm gonna get going.

01:08:42.248 --> 01:08:43.728
What's your hurry?

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.254
I'm gonna be going away soon.

01:08:48.254 --> 01:08:51.214
And before I do,
there are some things...

01:08:51.214 --> 01:08:52.606
I better put right.

01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:55.522
Interview suspended 10:52 a.m.

01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:00.266
What in the fuck was that?

01:09:00.266 --> 01:09:01.485
I don't know.

01:09:01.485 --> 01:09:03.400
Strange fucking tactics.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.749
So what's our next move?

01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:06.707
Not sure.

01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:08.013
How about we catch
our other killer

01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:09.188
while I mull it over?

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:26.988
"Walker."

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:30.557
Walker. John Walker.

01:09:33.343 --> 01:09:34.387
Damnit.

01:10:58.993 --> 01:11:00.038
Miles?

01:11:31.896 --> 01:11:33.114
John?

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:37.771
What's with the chrome?

01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:39.207
What? Are you gonna shoot me?

01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:41.732
The hell are you doing
in my kitchen?

01:11:42.776 --> 01:11:44.648
Can't believe the key
is in the same spot.

01:11:44.648 --> 01:11:47.433
- Let me get those groceries.
- No, no, no, no, no. No.

01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:49.130
Don't touch the groceries.

01:11:50.436 --> 01:11:52.090
What are you doing here?

01:11:56.355 --> 01:11:57.356
I'm here.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.325
Hey, I'm...

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.154
cashing out.

01:12:14.417 --> 01:12:15.766
So there's gonna be...

01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:17.724
gonna be some money
coming your way.

01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:21.989
I don't want your money.

01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:23.991
Let's... let's skip the part

01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:25.689
where you pretend
you don't and...

01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:27.647
I pretend to talk you into it.

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:43.750
Why are you cashing out?

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.145
Going away.

01:12:49.408 --> 01:12:50.453
Of course you are.

01:12:53.978 --> 01:12:56.110
I meant what I said
about the money.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:57.938
I never wanted
anything from you...

01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:00.419
except for you.

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:05.337
But I guess we both knew
that was too much to ask.

01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:16.957
Yeah.

01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:23.311
So, anyway. Uhm...

01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:28.752
I need you to make sure
Miles takes his share.

01:13:28.752 --> 01:13:30.754
That's...

01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:33.496
That's harder.

01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:39.893
Miles is harder.

01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:43.201
Yeah. And have him...

01:13:44.855 --> 01:13:46.378
So he can put...

01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:47.771
ah... the girl...

01:13:48.815 --> 01:13:49.860
She can go...

01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:51.775
Go to the, uh...

01:13:53.864 --> 01:13:54.908
You know.

01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:57.998
Goddammit.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:00.436
The big school.

01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:03.743
College.
Yeah.

01:14:03.743 --> 01:14:05.571
Yeah, uh...

01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:07.791
Yeah.

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:09.401
I mean, you know,

01:14:09.401 --> 01:14:11.621
something good has to come out
of all this.

01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:13.492
How long you going away for?

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.103
There's no coming back
from this one.

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.504
They finally caught up
to you, uh?

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.332
You must be slipping.

01:14:28.855 --> 01:14:30.422
Yeah.

01:14:31.858 --> 01:14:33.033
Yeah, you could say that.

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:48.919
So, anyway...

01:14:50.747 --> 01:14:52.226
yeah.

01:14:52.226 --> 01:14:53.358
Okay.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.404
All right.

01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:04.630
Knox...

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:10.114
I still love you. Just a little.

01:15:10.114 --> 01:15:11.550
As much as I hate you,

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:12.899
I wouldn't want to shoot you,
so...

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:15.815
call ahead next time.

01:15:17.687 --> 01:15:18.731
Yeah.

01:15:20.167 --> 01:15:21.604
There isn't gonna be
a next time.

01:16:08.476 --> 01:16:10.566
<i>You must be
slipping.</i>

01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:21.141
<i>But I guess
we both know</i>

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.403
<i>that was too much to ask.</i>

01:16:29.236 --> 01:16:31.064
Knox.

01:16:31.064 --> 01:16:32.196
Fucking...

01:16:32.196 --> 01:16:33.371
John?

01:16:33.371 --> 01:16:35.721
Sorry. Am I early?

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.600
No, uh...

01:16:45.992 --> 01:16:48.821
I was just gonna... why don't I
jump in the shower?

01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:52.346
Let's have a drink first.
I'll make you one for once.

01:16:57.351 --> 01:17:00.528
I wasn't sure you'd want me here
after last time.

01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:02.139
Why? What happened last time?

01:17:06.056 --> 01:17:08.232
You got me worried, Knox.

01:17:08.232 --> 01:17:09.407
Jesus, Ruby!

01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:11.235
Don't worry about it.

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:14.412
I just gotta get a handle
on this last part of this thing.

01:17:14.412 --> 01:17:16.980
How is the cash out coming?

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.721
I got the paintings
and I got the cash,

01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:20.679
I just have
to get the stones here tonight.

01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:21.985
The stones?

01:17:21.985 --> 01:17:24.509
Yeah, the stones.

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:25.858
And then I gotta take them
to my guy.

01:17:25.858 --> 01:17:27.512
He turns everything
into clean cash.

01:17:28.252 --> 01:17:30.210
Then I just have to...

01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:31.908
cut it into thirds.

01:17:31.908 --> 01:17:33.039
Why thirds?

01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:36.477
Only got three people
on the list. You're on the list.

01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:42.222
I don't even
look like her, Knox.

01:17:51.492 --> 01:17:53.494
Here's
to every Thursday afternoon.

01:18:18.476 --> 01:18:19.651
You just get a hand job?

01:18:21.435 --> 01:18:23.002
Better.

01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:25.439
You're not gonna believe
what Tech just found.

01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:27.441
- So tell me.
- No!

01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:30.314
No. You gotta hear this
for yourself. Come on!

01:18:30.314 --> 01:18:32.403
<i>Okay,</i>

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:33.839
everything we thought we'd find

01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:34.884
based on his previous
arrest record.

01:18:34.884 --> 01:18:36.755
Oh, God.

01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:38.322
But where

01:18:38.322 --> 01:18:39.410
it gets interesting
is in his live chats.

01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:40.759
He was communicating

01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:41.891
with half a dozen
young teen girls.

01:18:41.891 --> 01:18:43.457
Convincing them to send nudes.

01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:45.155
When we get the guy
who killed this asshole,

01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:46.547
- we should give him a medal.
- First we let him loose

01:18:46.547 --> 01:18:47.635
on a few other guys
I can think of.

01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:49.028
It's always guys with you.

01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:50.203
There's one girl

01:18:50.203 --> 01:18:51.770
he talked to for over a year,

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.511
but then they actually started
to meet up IRL.

01:18:53.511 --> 01:18:55.426
IRL?

01:18:55.426 --> 01:18:57.080
In real life.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.735
So say that.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:02.215
They definitely
had sex.

01:19:02.215 --> 01:19:04.174
A lot of sex.
They talked about it.

01:19:04.174 --> 01:19:05.653
Extensively.

01:19:05.653 --> 01:19:06.872
Anybody got a Tums?

01:19:09.832 --> 01:19:12.617
Anyway, I was able to trace
her IP address.

01:19:12.617 --> 01:19:14.271
She's a 16-year-old girl

01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:17.056
in Silver Lake by the name
of Kaylee Iris Knox.

01:19:17.056 --> 01:19:18.623
Okay.

01:19:18.623 --> 01:19:20.407
Let's talk
to her and her parents.

01:19:21.539 --> 01:19:22.845
Wait.

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:24.063
You said "Knox"?

01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:26.631
I ran the family.

01:19:26.631 --> 01:19:28.764
It's John Knox's granddaughter.

01:21:17.437 --> 01:21:20.745
I'm sorry. Why do you want
to talk to our daughter?

01:21:20.745 --> 01:21:23.791
Ah... we just have
a few questions for Kaylee.

01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:25.228
And for your husband.

01:21:25.228 --> 01:21:26.316
You guys are gonna be
right in here.

01:21:28.622 --> 01:21:30.537
Oh, Mr. Knox.

01:21:30.537 --> 01:21:31.712
Actually, we're gonna put you
in this room right over here.

01:21:33.236 --> 01:21:34.324
Hang on a second.

01:21:36.587 --> 01:21:38.894
Just be honest, okay?
Tell the truth.

01:21:43.724 --> 01:21:46.466
Detective Ikari is gonna be
right with you.

01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:07.765
<i>Like, what if I did?</i>

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.223
Detective Emily Ikari,

01:23:31.223 --> 01:23:33.008
interviewing Miles Knox.
It is...

01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:35.662
4:37 p.m.

01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:39.275
Andrew Palmer.

01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:43.061
What?

01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:45.324
Pretty sure you know who he is.

01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:47.500
I thought this was
about the fight at the café.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.633
What fight at what café?

01:23:53.724 --> 01:23:54.768
Okay...

01:23:56.292 --> 01:23:57.771
What about that prick?

01:23:57.771 --> 01:23:59.860
We know
what happened between you.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.297
You called them?

01:24:01.297 --> 01:24:02.689
You said you wouldn't call them.

01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:04.387
- No, we didn't.
- No. You promised

01:24:04.387 --> 01:24:05.866
if I went to the clinic,
you wouldn't tell on him.

01:24:05.866 --> 01:24:06.954
Honey...

01:24:06.954 --> 01:24:08.086
Kaylee, Kaylee.

01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:09.609
Your parents didn't call us.

01:24:09.609 --> 01:24:11.307
Neither your mom or your dad.

01:24:11.307 --> 01:24:13.265
What's this about, then?
What do you want to know?

01:24:13.265 --> 01:24:16.268
We found chats on his computer
between him and your daughter.

01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:19.445
We're pretty sure
you know what's going on.

01:24:19.445 --> 01:24:21.056
We know that he raped you.

01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:25.190
H-he... he didn't rape me.

01:24:28.019 --> 01:24:29.803
Did you arrest him?

01:24:29.803 --> 01:24:32.763
No. He... he's not
in any trouble with the law.

01:24:32.763 --> 01:24:34.286
Well, if you're asking me

01:24:34.286 --> 01:24:35.418
if I want to press charges,
I don't wanna--

01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:36.854
It's too late for that.

01:24:36.854 --> 01:24:37.942
He's dead.

01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:43.078
Good.

01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:46.646
Was it an accident?
'Cause I hope he suffered.

01:24:46.646 --> 01:24:47.952
I wanna show you something.

01:24:52.261 --> 01:24:53.566
See that there?

01:24:53.566 --> 01:24:55.568
That's your car.

01:24:55.568 --> 01:24:58.658
Driving into the gated
neighborhood where Palmer lives.

01:24:58.658 --> 01:25:00.356
This is about 20 minutes later.

01:25:01.705 --> 01:25:04.011
See by the timestamp. See?

01:25:04.011 --> 01:25:05.709
That's you, no doubt.

01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:07.754
Yeah, that's me.

01:25:07.754 --> 01:25:09.713
Yeah, I went to see him.
So what?

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:12.846
So, somewhere
in this time frame,

01:25:12.846 --> 01:25:14.979
Palmer was stabbed to death
in his kitchen.

01:25:14.979 --> 01:25:16.633
Wow. You can narrow the
time of death

01:25:16.633 --> 01:25:18.113
to 20 minutes?

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.418
Modern science.

01:25:19.418 --> 01:25:20.506
This is the part
where you tell me

01:25:20.506 --> 01:25:21.638
you just went to warn him

01:25:21.638 --> 01:25:22.987
to stay away from your daughter?

01:25:22.987 --> 01:25:24.554
Yeah, it's exactly right.

01:25:24.554 --> 01:25:26.164
And I might have punched him.

01:25:26.164 --> 01:25:27.296
Mhm...

01:25:27.948 --> 01:25:29.820
How did you cut your hand there?

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.387
On a glass.

01:25:31.387 --> 01:25:32.997
We're gonna find
that glass in your house?

01:25:32.997 --> 01:25:34.651
No, I was at...

01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:37.001
What do you mean at my house?

01:25:37.001 --> 01:25:39.090
Based on this video,

01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:41.440
we obtained a warrant
for your house and your car.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.702
They're being searched now.

01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:48.055
I'm not gonna say another word
until my attorney gets here.

01:25:48.055 --> 01:25:50.319
And that goes
for my underaged daughter.

01:25:50.319 --> 01:25:53.060
Stop talking to her. Right now.

01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:05.508
You all right?

01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:09.642
Hey, man. Are you okay?

01:26:15.082 --> 01:26:16.258
Yeah.

01:26:16.258 --> 01:26:18.216
<i>We got you.</i>

01:26:18.216 --> 01:26:19.348
Do you, now?

01:26:19.348 --> 01:26:20.958
Don't say anything.

01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:22.089
Sure.

01:26:22.089 --> 01:26:24.222
I'll do the talking.

01:26:24.222 --> 01:26:25.963
Show you what we found?

01:26:30.881 --> 01:26:32.361
Your bloody clothes found

01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:34.711
in a dumpster
behind your apartment.

01:26:34.711 --> 01:26:36.539
What? Bullshit.

01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:38.236
The murder weapon...

01:26:38.236 --> 01:26:41.370
hidden in a heating vent
in your apartment.

01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:42.936
No, no.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:45.330
- That's not right.
- Miles, stop talking.

01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:48.028
The knife has prints
all over it.

01:26:48.028 --> 01:26:49.595
We'll be pulling yours
for comparison

01:26:49.595 --> 01:26:51.249
in about five minutes.

01:26:51.249 --> 01:26:54.252
Me? I'm confident.

01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:57.864
Long, blonde hair recovered
from the lapel of your coat.

01:26:57.864 --> 01:27:00.127
Would you wanna bet
it matches the victim?

01:27:00.127 --> 01:27:02.260
Don't speak.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:06.395
Miles Knox, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Andrew Palmer.

01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:08.527
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:27:08.527 --> 01:27:10.225
Anything you say
can be held against you

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:11.617
in a court of law.

01:27:12.401 --> 01:27:14.664
Here, a little coin
for your trouble.

01:27:14.664 --> 01:27:16.927
I'm good. I'm glad
you guys showed up.

01:27:16.927 --> 01:27:18.015
Take care of him.

01:27:18.015 --> 01:27:19.103
Thank you.

01:27:21.758 --> 01:27:24.239
All kinds of people
make this world, don't they?

01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:30.157
Okay, pal.

01:27:31.637 --> 01:27:33.683
How are you even here?

01:27:33.683 --> 01:27:36.686
I'm the last person
you called, see?

01:27:36.686 --> 01:27:39.254
Give Ludmilla your keys.
She'll drive your Caddy back.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.386
I can drive my own car.

01:27:41.386 --> 01:27:42.953
It's right
around the corner.

01:27:42.953 --> 01:27:44.128
50 meters away. Come.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.785
Hey,
congrats on the arrest.

01:27:48.785 --> 01:27:50.569
Thanks.

01:27:50.569 --> 01:27:51.962
I found out why Knox went
to San Francisco.

01:27:51.962 --> 01:27:53.964
He was there to see a doctor.

01:27:53.964 --> 01:27:56.096
!Ah... Doctor...

01:27:56.096 --> 01:27:57.489
Frederick Burns.

01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:00.231
The neurologist?

01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:01.319
How do you know that?

01:28:02.538 --> 01:28:03.930
Obviously,

01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:05.497
I couldn't get
any medical records,

01:28:05.497 --> 01:28:07.282
but the guy specializes
in treating dementia.

01:28:09.109 --> 01:28:10.807
Okay. Good work.

01:28:10.807 --> 01:28:11.938
Thank you.

01:28:14.767 --> 01:28:17.030
Did you at least
get what you came for?

01:28:19.468 --> 01:28:21.513
Yeah... yeah.

01:28:28.694 --> 01:28:30.696
Xavier...

01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:32.132
I can only remember about...

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.093
Three hours of today.

01:28:36.093 --> 01:28:38.138
It's like a curtain coming down.

01:28:42.099 --> 01:28:43.405
That's rough.

01:28:46.146 --> 01:28:47.191
Why me?

01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:50.150
I mean, you know.

01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:53.415
Trained killer, Army,
and all that, I know, but...

01:28:53.415 --> 01:28:54.807
Why'd you pull me in?

01:28:58.071 --> 01:29:01.814
That brain of yours.

01:29:01.814 --> 01:29:03.338
I knew you'd understand

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:04.730
the training
I was putting you through.

01:29:06.558 --> 01:29:07.907
You know, in all this time...

01:29:07.907 --> 01:29:09.474
Mhm?

01:29:09.474 --> 01:29:11.955
Never left a print behind,
no DNA, nothing.

01:29:11.955 --> 01:29:14.174
Mmm...

01:29:14.174 --> 01:29:16.612
I learned from the master.

01:29:16.612 --> 01:29:18.135
What's your count, anyway?

01:29:18.135 --> 01:29:19.702
Two.

01:29:19.702 --> 01:29:20.833
Two?

01:29:22.487 --> 01:29:23.706
Come on.

01:29:23.706 --> 01:29:25.577
The cabbie in Chicago and...

01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:28.275
a woman in the shower.

01:29:31.931 --> 01:29:34.020
Two civilians. Fuck.

01:29:35.631 --> 01:29:36.675
You know...

01:29:37.676 --> 01:29:40.113
Muncie...

01:29:40.113 --> 01:29:43.900
he liked to talk
about the targets, you know.

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:45.641
Pimps, drug dealers, traffickers.

01:29:46.859 --> 01:29:47.904
Yeah.

01:29:48.992 --> 01:29:50.385
I think it made him feel better.

01:29:52.038 --> 01:29:54.214
He never got what it was...

01:29:54.214 --> 01:29:55.520
really all about.

01:29:56.913 --> 01:29:58.044
Which was?

01:29:58.044 --> 01:30:00.917
Guys caught behind enemy lines.

01:30:00.917 --> 01:30:02.048
That's all.

01:30:06.226 --> 01:30:08.011
So...

01:30:08.011 --> 01:30:10.927
We only have two steps left.

01:30:12.711 --> 01:30:15.845
Your visit and my call.

01:30:15.845 --> 01:30:17.194
Visit and a call.

01:30:18.891 --> 01:30:21.285
Visit and the call,
visit and the call.

01:30:21.285 --> 01:30:22.634
I can do that.

01:30:22.634 --> 01:30:24.506
Keep the notes in your pocket.

01:30:25.855 --> 01:30:28.771
I'll remind you when to go.

01:30:30.512 --> 01:30:31.774
You'll be done

01:30:31.774 --> 01:30:32.862
tomorrow.

01:30:37.649 --> 01:30:39.390
I'm scared.

01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:40.913
Yeah

01:30:40.913 --> 01:30:42.001
I figured.

01:30:58.365 --> 01:30:59.889
Hey...

01:30:59.889 --> 01:31:02.674
I need you to do
one more thing for me.

01:31:02.674 --> 01:31:04.415
Finish my cash out.

01:31:04.415 --> 01:31:06.504
Take my stuff to Philo.

01:31:06.504 --> 01:31:09.202
You wanna put me
in charge of your money?

01:31:09.202 --> 01:31:10.726
You know I'm a thief.

01:31:10.726 --> 01:31:12.336
You're not gonna steal from me.

01:31:12.336 --> 01:31:14.077
No...

01:31:14.077 --> 01:31:15.513
Probably not.

01:31:15.513 --> 01:31:17.689
Wait here. I'll bring it out.

01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:19.038
Okay, yeah.

01:32:32.721 --> 01:32:34.940
I'm sorry, Knox.

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.028
It's a lot of money.

01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:40.642
Can't argue with that.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.952
- Now what?
- Get the stones.

01:32:46.952 --> 01:32:48.040
Ah...

01:32:50.477 --> 01:32:52.044
Easy, easy, easy.

01:33:11.150 --> 01:33:12.630
Where you going, huh?

01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:14.284
Eh?

01:33:57.675 --> 01:33:58.676
Knox...

01:34:02.724 --> 01:34:04.595
How were you gonna
split the take?

01:34:05.901 --> 01:34:07.206
Four equal shares.

01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:11.689
That's funny?

01:34:11.689 --> 01:34:12.864
Yeah, it is.

01:34:15.606 --> 01:34:16.912
You were gonna get a third.

01:34:18.304 --> 01:34:19.349
What?

01:34:20.872 --> 01:34:22.439
You were one of the three.

01:34:23.919 --> 01:34:25.703
You're thinking of your ex-wife.

01:34:25.703 --> 01:34:27.096
No, Annie.

01:34:27.096 --> 01:34:28.184
It was you.

01:34:30.708 --> 01:34:34.016
My Thursday afternoon date
for the last four years.

01:34:35.626 --> 01:34:38.455
My ex-wife, my son...

01:34:39.456 --> 01:34:40.500
and you.

01:34:42.589 --> 01:34:43.721
All you had to do...

01:34:45.636 --> 01:34:46.681
was nothing.

01:35:00.607 --> 01:35:02.522
He wants to make
a change to the list.

01:35:02.522 --> 01:35:04.786
Take off the last name,
the hooker.

01:35:04.786 --> 01:35:07.092
No problemo.

01:35:07.092 --> 01:35:10.269
You split it even, fifty-fifty,
between the wife and the son.

01:35:10.269 --> 01:35:12.184
Carve out something for you?

01:35:12.184 --> 01:35:13.925
No, I'm good.

01:35:35.773 --> 01:35:37.514
What the hell, Dad?

01:35:37.514 --> 01:35:39.342
I don't understand why you'd--

01:35:39.342 --> 01:35:41.692
Wait, wait, wait. Stop.
I don't understand...

01:35:41.692 --> 01:35:43.302
Stop. Just listen to me.

01:35:43.302 --> 01:35:45.130
I'm so confused.

01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:46.523
I went to you for help.

01:35:46.523 --> 01:35:49.874
Why? Why would you
do this to me?

01:35:49.874 --> 01:35:52.268
You're the reason
I went to prison.

01:35:54.226 --> 01:35:55.358
I'm what?

01:35:55.358 --> 01:35:56.663
The tax evasion thing.

01:35:57.316 --> 01:35:59.928
You're the one
who ratted me out.

01:35:59.928 --> 01:36:01.843
What the hell? I didn't know
anything about you back then.

01:36:01.843 --> 01:36:05.281
I did six years because of you.

01:36:05.281 --> 01:36:08.023
No, no. That's not true.

01:36:08.023 --> 01:36:09.589
That's not true, Dad.

01:36:09.589 --> 01:36:11.113
Listen to me.
I think you're losing it.

01:36:11.113 --> 01:36:12.810
Something's wrong with you.
Why would...

01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:14.159
Why would you
think I would do that?

01:36:14.159 --> 01:36:15.247
Look at me.

01:36:16.945 --> 01:36:17.989
It was you.

01:36:20.339 --> 01:36:21.819
You turned me in.

01:36:21.819 --> 01:36:24.169
I did not! I didn't do it, Dad!

01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:27.259
That's not true!
Dad, listen to me! Listen to me!

01:36:27.259 --> 01:36:29.392
Dad! Goddammit!

01:36:29.392 --> 01:36:30.785
Listen to me!

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:33.265
Why would I do that
even if I knew!

01:36:33.265 --> 01:36:34.353
You're wrong!

01:36:43.014 --> 01:36:44.624
- Hey, Ikari.
- What?

01:36:44.624 --> 01:36:46.322
There's a problem
with the Palmer evidence.

01:36:46.322 --> 01:36:49.455
- Which evidence?
- All of it.

01:36:49.455 --> 01:36:52.328
It's a first. There is a problem
with the blood on the clothes.

01:36:52.328 --> 01:36:54.156
Evidence of Erythromycin.

01:36:54.156 --> 01:36:57.202
That's a molecular breakdown
consistent with freezing.

01:36:57.202 --> 01:37:01.554
The blood on the clothes was
frozen for at least 12 hours

01:37:01.554 --> 01:37:03.687
before it was thawed
and put on the fabric.

01:37:04.601 --> 01:37:05.994
Put?

01:37:05.994 --> 01:37:07.560
Yeah. Same with the knife.

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.388
Wait... that's not
the murder weapon?

01:37:09.388 --> 01:37:11.738
No, it definitely is,
and the blood is the victim's.

01:37:11.738 --> 01:37:13.610
The issue is
with the fingerprints.

01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:15.003
No. I saw the comparison.

01:37:15.003 --> 01:37:16.221
They matched
Miles Knox's prints,

01:37:16.221 --> 01:37:17.788
no question.

01:37:17.788 --> 01:37:19.659
Yes, but they contained
traces of monomers.

01:37:19.659 --> 01:37:21.879
Butyl acrylate
and methyl methacrylate.

01:37:21.879 --> 01:37:22.880
Packing tape.

01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:25.927
Also, some sort
of household spice.

01:37:25.927 --> 01:37:27.406
I'm sorry, detective.

01:37:27.406 --> 01:37:29.060
The prints on the knife
were planted.

01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.453
Planted?

01:37:31.454 --> 01:37:32.934
Christ...

01:37:32.934 --> 01:37:34.849
And then, there's the hair
from the coat.

01:37:34.849 --> 01:37:36.241
It's really impossible

01:37:36.241 --> 01:37:37.373
that this was
the only thing we found.

01:37:37.373 --> 01:37:39.505
I've been over this three times.

01:37:39.505 --> 01:37:42.334
In my opinion, this jacket
was never anywhere

01:37:42.334 --> 01:37:43.770
near the crime scene.

01:37:43.770 --> 01:37:45.468
But we have the video.

01:37:45.468 --> 01:37:48.384
Yeah... about that...

01:37:48.384 --> 01:37:49.472
Fuck me!

01:37:57.393 --> 01:37:58.785
Hey.

01:37:58.785 --> 01:38:00.875
You're almost home.

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.354
One more step.

01:38:02.354 --> 01:38:03.529
Okay.

01:38:04.617 --> 01:38:06.881
<i>I'm gonna
make the call.</i>

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:08.621
You just sit tight.

01:38:08.621 --> 01:38:11.146
Oh, did you get rid
of the notebook?

01:38:11.146 --> 01:38:12.321
Yeah, I did.

01:38:12.321 --> 01:38:14.062
Because this all goes to hell

01:38:14.062 --> 01:38:15.324
if they find the notebook.

01:38:15.324 --> 01:38:16.934
You understand?

01:38:16.934 --> 01:38:18.327
It's gone.

01:38:18.327 --> 01:38:19.502
<i>What did you do
with it?</i>

01:38:19.502 --> 01:38:20.590
I burned it.

01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:21.896
Okay.

01:38:22.505 --> 01:38:24.550
I'll make the call
and it's over.

01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:26.552
Yeah, good.

01:38:26.552 --> 01:38:28.511
Hey, eh... X.

01:38:29.642 --> 01:38:31.383
You should...

01:38:31.383 --> 01:38:34.734
probably tell her I got
three dead bodies over here.

01:38:34.734 --> 01:38:37.650
Do you have...
three dead bodies in there?

01:38:37.650 --> 01:38:39.043
<i>I do.</i>

01:38:39.043 --> 01:38:40.349
- Three?
<i>- </i>  [Knox] <i>Three.</i>

01:38:43.482 --> 01:38:44.962
Oh, John.

01:38:44.962 --> 01:38:46.050
Yeah.

01:38:46.877 --> 01:38:47.922
Listen...

01:38:52.187 --> 01:38:53.231
Good luck.

01:38:57.279 --> 01:38:58.758
It's
almost imperceptible

01:38:58.758 --> 01:38:59.846
to the naked eye,

01:38:59.846 --> 01:39:01.761
but there's a jump there.

01:39:01.761 --> 01:39:04.068
And if you go
into the root file,

01:39:04.068 --> 01:39:05.635
someone clearly deleted

01:39:05.635 --> 01:39:07.245
the original timestamp
and wrote over it.

01:39:07.245 --> 01:39:09.073
Hard to spot, but it's there.

01:39:09.073 --> 01:39:10.988
Meaning what?

01:39:10.988 --> 01:39:12.555
He could have driven

01:39:12.555 --> 01:39:14.165
in-and-out of the gate
on any day, at any time.

01:39:14.165 --> 01:39:16.254
The footage was
simply spliced in.

01:39:21.738 --> 01:39:23.479
Miles Knox was framed?

01:39:23.479 --> 01:39:25.002
It's what it looks like.

01:39:25.002 --> 01:39:27.657
It doesn't add up.
Nothing makes sense.

01:39:27.657 --> 01:39:29.180
Detective Ikari.

01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:30.703
- Not now.
- There's a phone call for you.

01:39:30.703 --> 01:39:32.792
I said not now!
Okay, but...

01:39:32.792 --> 01:39:34.229
This guy says
it has something to do

01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:35.273
with John Knox.

01:39:36.448 --> 01:39:38.189
This is detective Ikari.

01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:40.365
<i>You know Aristotle Knox?</i>

01:39:40.365 --> 01:39:42.498
You should get up
to his bungalow

01:39:42.498 --> 01:39:44.456
Why the hell would I do that?

01:39:44.456 --> 01:39:47.024
<i>He's got
three dead bodies in there.</i>

01:39:47.024 --> 01:39:49.070
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:51.376
An anonymous, concerned citizen.

01:40:03.562 --> 01:40:04.911
Don't move! Do not move!

01:40:06.652 --> 01:40:08.219
God bodies.

01:40:08.219 --> 01:40:10.134
What happened?

01:40:11.353 --> 01:40:13.007
Jesus, Knox.

01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:14.486
Put your hands
behind your back.

01:40:14.486 --> 01:40:15.618
All right.

01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:20.014
Let's go.

01:40:23.626 --> 01:40:25.323
Hey, hey! Ikari!

01:40:25.323 --> 01:40:26.542
You're gonna want
to check this out.

01:40:37.727 --> 01:40:39.381
Why would he...?

01:40:39.381 --> 01:40:40.556
What the hell is this?

01:40:41.339 --> 01:40:42.384
What?

01:40:48.607 --> 01:40:49.956
Jesus Christ.

01:40:52.263 --> 01:40:54.700
It was him.

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.398
My client won't be
making any statements.

01:40:56.398 --> 01:40:58.269
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll do the talking again.

01:40:58.835 --> 01:41:00.054
You can wait outside.

01:41:02.447 --> 01:41:03.840
So, Miles.

01:41:05.494 --> 01:41:07.496
We know you didn't kill
Andrew Palmer.

01:41:09.106 --> 01:41:11.630
What?
You're in the clear.

01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:13.328
We're dropping all the charges.

01:41:13.328 --> 01:41:14.938
You'll walk out of here
in half an hour a free man.

01:41:14.938 --> 01:41:17.680
But first, tell me again
how you cut your hand.

01:41:19.508 --> 01:41:20.552
On a broken glass.

01:41:21.466 --> 01:41:22.859
Where?

01:41:22.859 --> 01:41:24.469
At my father's house.

01:41:24.469 --> 01:41:25.862
Why were you there?

01:41:25.862 --> 01:41:27.081
Don't say anything.

01:41:35.132 --> 01:41:37.700
At least...
tell me about your dad.

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:39.310
In general terms.

01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:40.485
Don't.
- Wait.

01:41:44.185 --> 01:41:45.360
In general terms?

01:41:48.319 --> 01:41:49.755
A lousy jerk.

01:41:49.755 --> 01:41:51.670
And a hothead?

01:41:51.670 --> 01:41:53.759
Yeah, that's right.
He's abusive.

01:41:53.759 --> 01:41:56.414
He's a despicable human being.

01:41:56.414 --> 01:41:58.024
See, I get that.

01:41:58.024 --> 01:41:59.939
But how big a prick
do you need to be...

01:42:01.506 --> 01:42:03.247
to frame your own son
for murder?

01:42:07.469 --> 01:42:08.905
I don't follow.

01:42:08.905 --> 01:42:10.602
I got all the evidence.

01:42:10.602 --> 01:42:13.214
Everything he used to frame you
was in his house.

01:42:13.214 --> 01:42:15.912
He planted your prints
on the murder weapon,

01:42:15.912 --> 01:42:17.522
hid it in your wall,

01:42:17.522 --> 01:42:19.307
put the victim's blood
on your clothes,

01:42:19.307 --> 01:42:21.526
his hair on your clothes.

01:42:21.526 --> 01:42:23.137
Put your blood

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:24.442
from that broken glass
at the murder scene.

01:42:24.442 --> 01:42:25.661
Why would he do that?

01:42:26.966 --> 01:42:28.577
Why does he hate you so much?

01:42:36.672 --> 01:42:37.803
'Cause I turned him in.

01:42:39.327 --> 01:42:40.893
What do you mean?

01:42:40.893 --> 01:42:42.112
The tax case
he went to prison for.

01:42:42.852 --> 01:42:44.593
I was the one
who called the IRS.

01:42:44.593 --> 01:42:46.029
Mhm... no.

01:42:46.029 --> 01:42:47.117
The file says that was
someone named--

01:42:47.117 --> 01:42:48.292
File's wrong.

01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:50.425
It was me.

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:12.534
We never could tie
that gun to you.

01:43:12.534 --> 01:43:14.188
Looks like you got away
with that one.

01:43:16.494 --> 01:43:17.930
But just between us...

01:43:19.802 --> 01:43:22.239
tell me.

01:43:22.239 --> 01:43:23.980
It was you who shot Muncie,
wasn't it?

01:43:33.119 --> 01:43:34.208
Muncie coming?

01:43:35.426 --> 01:43:36.514
Muncie is dead.

01:43:37.428 --> 01:43:38.734
You killed him.

01:43:42.607 --> 01:43:44.000
They have newspapers here.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.480
Muncie likes
to read the newspaper.

01:43:59.668 --> 01:44:01.496
0-5-2-3!

01:44:05.151 --> 01:44:06.240
Sorry.

01:44:09.068 --> 01:44:10.113
He's not doing well.

01:44:12.463 --> 01:44:14.030
Why do you wanna see him?

01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:15.684
He tried to frame you.

01:44:15.684 --> 01:44:17.294
Yeah, I mean...

01:44:17.294 --> 01:44:19.775
He still killed the man
who raped my daughter.

01:44:19.775 --> 01:44:22.386
And that's okay
with you? Murder?

01:44:22.386 --> 01:44:24.910
If I could, I'd dig Palmer up
and I'd kill him again.

01:44:27.348 --> 01:44:30.960
By the way, they're moving him
to a medical facility tomorrow.

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.657
I tried to get
a move sooner, but...

01:44:33.745 --> 01:44:34.877
bureaucracy.

01:44:37.227 --> 01:44:38.663
He went so fast, didn't he?

01:44:39.969 --> 01:44:41.275
Fortunately for you.

01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:43.929
How do you mean?

01:44:43.929 --> 01:44:45.931
If he hadn't been
losing his mind,

01:44:45.931 --> 01:44:48.020
he might have gotten away
with framing you.

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.152
Lucky for me, then.

01:44:51.981 --> 01:44:53.025
Yeah.

01:45:19.835 --> 01:45:21.663
Hey, Dad.

01:45:21.663 --> 01:45:22.751
Is it Sunday?

01:45:24.361 --> 01:45:27.059
No, no. It's not.

01:45:27.059 --> 01:45:28.322
It's Wednesday, Dad.

01:45:29.845 --> 01:45:31.107
- Why?
- Well...

01:45:33.544 --> 01:45:34.850
My son likes football.

01:45:37.679 --> 01:45:38.723
Is that so?

01:45:38.723 --> 01:45:39.811
Yeah.

01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:44.338
Sometimes we go
to the Rose Bowl.

01:45:49.299 --> 01:45:50.996
I bet he loves that.

01:45:50.996 --> 01:45:52.389
Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:45:54.435 --> 01:45:55.436
But...

01:46:04.706 --> 01:46:05.794
Sunday...

01:46:08.536 --> 01:46:09.580
I love you, Dad.

01:46:18.067 --> 01:46:19.111
Yeah.

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:33.316
Who wants to get beat?
- I don't know it.
