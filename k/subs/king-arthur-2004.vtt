00:41.000 --> 00:46.100
by 300 AD, the Roman Empire
extended from Arabia to Britain.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.200
but they wanted more.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.900
More land.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.700
More peoples
loyal and subservient to Rome.

00:58.300 --> 01:03.400
but no people so important
as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.900
Thousands died on that field.

01:08.100 --> 01:13.100
and when the smoke cleared on the fourth
day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive

01:13.300 --> 01:18.400
were members of the decimated
but legendary cavalry.

01:18.700 --> 01:24.100
The Romans, impressed by their bravery
and horsemanship, spared their lives.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.600
452 AD

01:25.800 --> 01:31.400
ln exchange, these warriors were
incorporated into the Roman military.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.800
better they had died that day.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.500
Father.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.600
They are here.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.400
For the second part of the bargain they
struck indebted not only themselves...

02:03.600 --> 02:05.100
The day has come.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.300
..but also their sons,
and their sons, and so on,

02:08.500 --> 02:11.200
to serve the empire as knights.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.300
l was such a son.

02:28.600 --> 02:33.100
There is a legend that
fallen knights return as great horses.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.900
He has seen what awaits you,
and he will protect you.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.900
Lancelot! Lancelot!

02:42.300 --> 02:44.600
Lancelot.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.900
Don't be afraid. l will return.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.400
- How long shall we be gone?
- 15 years,

03:20.500 --> 03:24.700
not including the months it'll take
to get to your post.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.400
Lancelot!

03:29.600 --> 03:31.700
Rus!

03:54.900 --> 03:58.900
Our post was britain -
or at least the southern half,

03:59.200 --> 04:04.000
for the land was divided by a 73-mile wall
built three centuries before us

04:04.300 --> 04:08.300
to protect the empire from
the native fighters of the north.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.200
So, as our forefathers had done,

04:11.400 --> 04:14.700
we made our way and reported
to our Roman commander in britain,

04:14.900 --> 04:18.000
ancestrally named for the first artorius,

04:18.300 --> 04:20.700
or arthur.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.300
Mother, l finished.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.400
That's beautiful.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.500
Mother...

04:48.600 --> 04:50.800
Pelagius. For you.

04:53.100 --> 04:56.000
Well done, artorius.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.000
You keep it.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.900
Deliver it to me
when you come to Rome.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.300
Come.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.800
behold, arthur. Young knights.

05:17.100 --> 05:22.300
lf you so choose, they may someday be
yours to lead, as your father before you.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.800
- l'm to be their commander?
- Yes.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.100
but with this title comes a sacred
responsibility to protect, to defend,

05:31.500 --> 05:35.400
to value their lives above your own
and, should they perish in battle,

05:35.600 --> 05:38.800
to live your life gloriously
in honour of their memory.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.800
and what of their free will?

05:40.900 --> 05:45.100
lt has always fallen to a few
to sacrifice for the good of many.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.700
The world isn't a perfect place,

05:47.900 --> 05:54.400
but perhaps people like you, arthur,
and me and them can make it so.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.200
1 5 YEaRS LaTER

06:35.100 --> 06:38.000
ah, as promised, the bishop's carriage.

06:39.200 --> 06:43.100
- Our freedom, bors.
- Mm. l can almost taste it.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.800
and your passage to Rome, arthur.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.400
Woads!

11:20.100 --> 11:22.600
Rus!

11:29.700 --> 11:31.400
Rus!

11:34.100 --> 11:35.700
Rus.

11:42.500 --> 11:47.700
Gratia plena, DOminus tecum. Benedicta
tu in mulieribus et DOminus tecum.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.800
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.
Benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.500
Benedicta tu in mulieribus...

11:53.600 --> 11:57.200
Save your prayers, boy.
Your god doesn't live here.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.100
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?

12:21.400 --> 12:24.100
Spill my blood with Excalibur and...

12:24.300 --> 12:26.800
make this ground holy.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.200
Pick it up.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.300
Pick it up.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.800
- bors.
- What a bloody mess.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.000
That's not the bishop.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.600
God help us.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.500
- What are they?
- blue demons that eat Christians alive.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.500
You're not a Christian, are you?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.900
Does this really work?

14:05.200 --> 14:06.700
Nothing.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.000
Maybe l'm not doin' it right.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.300
Stand down.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.400
arthur!

14:25.600 --> 14:29.300
arthur Castus. Your father's image.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.900
l haven't seen you since childhood.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.400
bishop Germanius. Welcome to britain.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.300
l see your military skills
are still of use to you.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.400
Your device worked.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.300
ancient tricks of an ancient dog.

14:49.200 --> 14:54.700
and these are the great Sarmatian knights
we have heard so much of in Rome.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.900
l thought the Woads control
the north of Hadrian's Wall.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.400
They do, but they
occasionally venture south.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.500
Rome's anticipated withdrawal from britain
has only increased their daring.

15:09.800 --> 15:13.400
- Woads?
- british rebels who hate Rome.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.200
Men who want their country back.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.300
- Who leads them?
- He's called Merlin.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.700
a dark magician, some say.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.900
Tristan, ride ahead
and make sure the road is clear.

15:24.200 --> 15:28.400
Please do not worry, bishop.
We will protect you.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.100
Oh.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.000
l've no doubt, Commander.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.000
No doubt.

15:46.300 --> 15:50.500
Dozens don't worry me
nearly so much as thousands.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.700
Thousands?

16:23.200 --> 16:25.800
l don't like him, that Roman.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
lf he's here to discharge us,
why doesn't he just give us our papers?

16:30.300 --> 16:33.300
ls this your happy face?

16:33.500 --> 16:35.900
Galahad, do you still
not know the Romans?

16:36.100 --> 16:38.300
They won't scratch their arses
without holding a ceremony.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.600
Why don't you just kill him,
and then discharge yourself after?

16:42.200 --> 16:44.600
l don't kill for pleasure, unlike some.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.300
Well, you should try it someday.
You might get a taste for it.

16:50.100 --> 16:54.100
- lt's a part of you. lt's in your blood.
- No, no, no. No.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.900
as of tomorrow
this was all just a bad memory.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.500
Ohh.

17:00.300 --> 17:05.000
l've often thought about what going home
would mean after all this. What will l do?

17:05.300 --> 17:07.200
lt's different for Galahad.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.599
l've been in this life longer than the other.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.300
So much for home.
lt's not so clear in my memory.

17:15.500 --> 17:20.099
You speak for yourself. lt's cold back there
and everyone l know is dead and buried.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.800
besides, l have, l think, a dozen children.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.700
Eleven.

17:26.900 --> 17:31.100
You listen. When the Romans leave here,
we'll have the run of all this place.

17:31.400 --> 17:35.200
l'll be governor in my own village
and Dagonet will be my personal guard

17:35.500 --> 17:38.300
and royal arse-kisser. Won't you, Dag?

17:38.500 --> 17:42.300
First thing l will do when l get home is
find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.500
a beautiful Sarmatian woman?

17:44.600 --> 17:47.400
Why do you think we left in the first place?

17:52.900 --> 17:54.900
What about you, Lancelot?
What are your plans for home?

17:55.100 --> 17:58.300
Well, if this woman of Gawain's
is as beautiful as he claims,

17:58.500 --> 18:01.200
l expect to be spending
a lot of time at Gawain's house.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.400
- His wife will welcome the company.
- l see. and what will l be doing?

18:04.700 --> 18:09.500
Wondering at your good fortune
that all your children look like me.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.600
ls that before or after l hit you with my axe?

18:23.100 --> 18:26.000
Where you been, now? Where you been?

18:26.700 --> 18:29.500
and what will you do, arthur,
when you return to your beloved Rome?

18:29.700 --> 18:32.500
Give thanks to God that l survived to see it.

18:32.700 --> 18:35.000
You and your god! You disturb me.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.200
l want peace, Lancelot. l've had enough.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.700
- You should visit me.
- ah!

18:40.800 --> 18:43.200
lt's a magnificent place, Rome.

18:43.500 --> 18:47.000
Ordered, civilised, advanced.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.500
a breeding ground of arrogant fools.

18:48.700 --> 18:52.300
The greatest minds in all the lands
have come together in one sacred place

18:52.500 --> 18:54.100
to help make mankind free.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.400
and the women?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.100
Open the gate!

19:44.200 --> 19:45.700
- Welcome back, arthur.
- jols.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.800
Lancelot.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.300
bishop, please, my quarters
have been made available to you.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.900
Oh, yes. l must rest.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.100
- Where have you been?
- Oh...

20:05.300 --> 20:09.200
- l've been waiting for you.
- Oh, my little flower. Such... passion!

20:13.700 --> 20:15.500
Where's my Gilly? Gilly.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.900
- You been fighting?
- Yes.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.200
- You been winning?
- Yes.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.200
That's my boy.
Come on, all my other bastards!

20:28.600 --> 20:31.700
Let us not forget that
we are the fortunate ones.

20:31.900 --> 20:36.500
Let us raise our wine to those gallant
and extraordinary men we have lost,

20:36.800 --> 20:40.400
but who will be remembered for eternity.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.900
To freedom.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.700
Pelagius.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.500
very kind of arthur to give up his room.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.700
but, of course, it is to be expected.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.100
Sir, l'm here to escort you
to the fortress hall.

21:27.400 --> 21:31.300
When my master meets with your knights,
he must be seated last

21:31.500 --> 21:34.300
and he must be seated
at the head of the table.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.500
Your master can plonk his holy arse
wherever he chooses.

21:41.600 --> 21:46.100
His Eminence, bishop Naius Germanius.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.500
a round table?
What sort of evil is this?

21:56.900 --> 21:59.400
arthur says for men to be men
they must first all be equal.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.900
l was given to understand
there would be more of you.

22:02.100 --> 22:05.700
There were. We have been
fighting here for 1 5 years, bishop.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.300
Oh, of course.

22:08.500 --> 22:12.800
arthur and his knights
have served with courage

22:13.000 --> 22:19.300
to maintain the honour of Rome's empire
on this last outpost of our glory.

22:19.700 --> 22:23.400
Rome is most indebted
to you noble knights.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.600
To your final days
as servants to the empire.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.200
Day. Not days.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.500
The Pope's taken
a personal interest in you.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.000
He inquires after each of you,

22:37.200 --> 22:43.400
and is curious to know if your knights have
converted to the word of Our Saviour or...?

22:43.800 --> 22:47.800
They retain the religion of their forefathers.
l have never questioned that.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.900
Of course, of course.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.300
They are pagans. Hm?

22:54.300 --> 22:57.600
For our part, the Church
has deemed such beliefs innocence,

22:57.900 --> 23:01.600
but you, arthur,
your path to God is through Pelagius?

23:02.200 --> 23:05.800
- l saw his image in your room.
- He took my father's place for me.

23:05.900 --> 23:09.100
His teachings on free will and equality
have been a great influence.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.900
l look forward to our reunion in Rome.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.500
ah.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.100
Rome awaits your arrival
with great anticipation.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.000
You are a hero.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.000
ln Rome, you will live out your days
in honour and wealth.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.900
alas...

23:27.800 --> 23:31.500
alas, we are all but players
in an ever-changing world.

23:31.800 --> 23:36.400
barbarians from every corner
are almost at Rome's door.

23:36.700 --> 23:42.000
because of this, Rome and the Holy Father
have decided to remove ourselves

23:42.300 --> 23:46.400
from indefensible outposts,
such as britain.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.800
What will become of britain
is not our concern any more.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.800
l suppose the Saxons will claim it soon.

23:53.100 --> 23:55.200
- Saxons?
- Yes.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.300
ln the north a massive
Saxon incursion has begun.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.800
- The Saxons only claim what they kill.
- and only kill everything.

24:04.100 --> 24:08.100
So you would just
leave the land to the Woads.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.100
and l risked my life for nothing.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.500
Hm.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.400
Gentlemen,

24:13.600 --> 24:18.100
your discharge papers with safe conduct
throughout the Roman Empire.

24:18.300 --> 24:22.000
but first, l must have a word
with your commander.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.200
- ln private.
- We have no secrets.

24:35.100 --> 24:40.000
Come. Let's leave Roman business
to Romans.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.000
Let it go, bors.

24:53.900 --> 24:58.000
Rome has issued a final order
for you and your men.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.700
Final order?

24:59.800 --> 25:04.400
You are to travel north
to rescue the family of Marius Honorius

25:04.600 --> 25:09.500
and return, in particular,
with Marius's son, alecto.

25:10.500 --> 25:15.800
alecto is the Pope's
favourite godchild and pupil.

25:16.500 --> 25:21.400
lt is his destiny to become a bishop,
perhaps even pope one day.

25:21.700 --> 25:24.900
On this day you ask this of my men.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.500
On this day.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.600
They have risked their lives for 1 5 years
for a cause not of their own.

25:37.800 --> 25:42.100
and now, on the day they are to be
liberated, you send them on a mission

25:42.400 --> 25:45.200
which is far more dangerous
than any other they have undertaken.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.300
You tell me, bishop,
how do l go to my men and tell them

25:48.500 --> 25:51.300
that instead of freedom l offer death?

25:51.500 --> 25:55.900
lf your men are truly the knights
of legend, perhaps some will survive.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.100
lf it is God's will.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.200
Your men want to go home,

26:00.400 --> 26:05.200
and to get home they need to cross
the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.

26:05.900 --> 26:10.000
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.700
Will you defy the Pope, arthur?

26:12.900 --> 26:15.000
Rome? God himself?

26:15.200 --> 26:17.200
Everything l've done has been
for the Church and for Rome.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.100
Do not mistake a loyal soldier
for a fool, Germanius.

26:20.300 --> 26:24.100
Would you leave a defenceless
Roman boy, destined to lead our Church,

26:24.400 --> 26:26.600
at the hands of the Saxons?

26:27.800 --> 26:32.500
Fulfil this mission, and your men
will receive their discharge.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.900
Their papers will be waiting here
the moment they return.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.700
You have my word.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.600
You think very hard upon that vow, bishop,
for l will hold you to it.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.800
break it, and no Roman legion,

26:52.200 --> 26:54.100
papal army,

26:55.700 --> 26:58.000
nor God himself will protect you.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.800
That is my word.

27:09.100 --> 27:13.600
- She gave me fleas.
- You better hope they're fleas.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.000
best of three.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.500
Who wants another drink?

27:28.300 --> 27:30.300
When you gonna leave bors
and come home with me?

27:30.400 --> 27:32.900
My lover is watching you.

27:44.300 --> 27:46.800
You look nothing like him.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.500
You're all bors.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.700
- Tristan...
- How do you do that?

27:56.400 --> 27:58.000
l aim for the middle.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.400
Oh, they want more!

28:00.600 --> 28:04.100
- Here. be a mother to your son.
- Oh, come here.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.900
Dagonet, where you been?
We've got plans to make.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.400
Here, please. Sing.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.800
- No.
- just a last one.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.800
- No, l'm trying to work.
- Come sing. Shut up!

28:16.000 --> 28:18.500
vanora will sing.

28:18.700 --> 28:21.400
- No, no.
- Sing! Sing!

28:22.600 --> 28:26.100
- Sing about home.
- Don't drop the baby.

28:28.900 --> 28:32.900
Land Of bear and land Of eagle

28:33.100 --> 28:37.200
Land that gave us birth and blessing

28:37.500 --> 28:41.500
Land that called us ever hOmewards

28:41.700 --> 28:45.600
We will gO hOme acrOss the mOuntains

28:45.900 --> 28:49.900
We will gO hOme
We will gO hOme

28:50.100 --> 28:54.300
We will gO hOme acrOss the mOuntains

28:54.600 --> 28:58.400
We will gO hOme singing Our sOng...

29:16.900 --> 29:20.700
..hear Our singing, hear Our lOnging

29:21.000 --> 29:25.300
We will gO hOme acrOss the mOuntains

29:25.500 --> 29:29.900
We will gO hOme
We will gO hOme...

29:35.900 --> 29:37.500
arthur!

29:37.800 --> 29:40.000
arthur!

29:41.900 --> 29:45.700
arthur! You're not
completely Roman yet, right?

29:45.900 --> 29:48.000
Rus!

29:52.100 --> 29:54.200
Knights...

29:54.400 --> 29:56.600
brothers in arms...

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
your courage has been tested
beyond all limits.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.200
Yes.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.500
but l must ask you now for one further trial.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.300
Drink.

30:04.500 --> 30:10.500
We must leave on a final mission for Rome
before our freedom can be granted.

30:14.100 --> 30:18.000
above the wall, far in the north,
there is a Roman family in need of rescue.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.400
They are trapped by Saxons.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.700
Our orders are to secure their safety.

30:22.900 --> 30:25.300
Let the Romans take care of their own.

30:25.500 --> 30:28.000
above the wall is Woad territory.

30:28.900 --> 30:33.600
Our duty to Rome,
if it was ever a duty, is done.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.700
Our pact with Rome is done.

30:36.900 --> 30:41.600
Every knight here
has laid his life on the line for you.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.300
For you.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.500
and instead of freedom
you want more blood?

30:46.700 --> 30:48.900
Our blood?

30:49.100 --> 30:51.200
You think more of Roman blood
than you do of ours?

30:51.400 --> 30:53.100
bors! These are our orders.

30:53.300 --> 30:57.000
We leave at first light, and when we return
your freedom will be waiting for you.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.900
a freedom we can embrace with honour.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.100
l am a free man!

31:01.200 --> 31:03.200
l will choose my own fate!

31:03.400 --> 31:06.000
Yeah, yeah.
We're all going to die someday.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.400
lf it's a death from a Saxon hand
that frightens you, stay home.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.700
Listen, if you're so eager to die,
you can die right now!

31:11.800 --> 31:13.800
- Enough. Enough!
- l've got something to live for!

31:14.000 --> 31:16.700
The Romans have broken their word.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.500
We have the word of arthur.
That is good enough.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.500
l'll prepare.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.600
bors?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.900
- You coming?
- Of course l'm coming!

31:28.100 --> 31:31.200
Can't let you go on your own!
You'll all get killed!

31:32.100 --> 31:34.900
l'm just saying what you're all thinking!

31:36.400 --> 31:38.300
vanora'll kill me.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.500
and you, Gawain?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.900
l'm with you.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.200
Galahad as well.

32:28.300 --> 32:32.300
O merciful God,
l have such need of your mercy now.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.800
Not for myself, but for my knights,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.300
for this is truly their hour of need.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.000
Deliver them from the trials ahead,

32:42.200 --> 32:46.300
and l will repay you a thousandfold
with any sacrifice you ask of me.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.900
and if, in your wisdom,

32:49.000 --> 32:52.400
you should determine that that sacrifice
must be my life for theirs,

32:52.700 --> 32:56.700
so they may once again taste the freedom
that has so long been denied to them,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
l will gladly make that covenant.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.900
My death will have a purpose.
l ask no more than that.

33:03.100 --> 33:06.100
Why do you always talk to God
and not to me?

33:06.300 --> 33:09.600
Oh, pray to whomever you pray
that we don't cross the Saxons.

33:09.900 --> 33:14.200
My faith is what protects me, Lancelot.
Why do you challenge this?

33:14.500 --> 33:16.800
l don't like anything
that puts a man on his knees.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.700
No man fears to kneel
before the god he trusts.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.300
Without faith, without belief in something,
what are we?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.900
To try and get past the Woads
in the north is insanity.

33:25.100 --> 33:28.000
- Them we've fought before.
- Not north of the wall!

33:30.700 --> 33:33.600
How many Saxons? Hm?

33:33.900 --> 33:35.900
How many?

33:38.700 --> 33:41.300
Tell me. Do you believe in this mission?

33:41.500 --> 33:43.100
These people need our help.

33:43.300 --> 33:46.000
- lt is our duty to bring them out.
- l don't care about your charge,

33:46.200 --> 33:50.200
and l don't give a damn about
Romans, britain or this island.

33:50.900 --> 33:53.700
lf you desire to spend eternity in this place,
arthur, so be it,

33:53.900 --> 33:55.800
but suicide cannot be chosen for another!

33:56.000 --> 33:58.800
- and yet you choose death for this family!
- No, l choose life!

33:59.000 --> 34:01.600
and freedom for myself and the men!

34:09.100 --> 34:12.300
How many times in battle have we
snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?

34:12.600 --> 34:15.800
Outnumbered, outflanked,
yet still we triumph.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.600
With you at my side, we can do so again.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.699
Lancelot, we are knights.

34:22.900 --> 34:26.400
What other purpose do we serve
if not for such a cause?

34:26.600 --> 34:29.800
arthur, you fight for a world
that will never exist.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.600
Never.

34:31.699 --> 34:34.400
There will always be a battlefield.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.900
l will die in battle.

34:40.100 --> 34:42.600
Of that l'm certain.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.800
and hopefully a battle of my choosing.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.600
but if it be this one,

34:50.800 --> 34:53.100
grant me a favour.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.199
Don't bury me in our sad little cemetery.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.800
burn me.

34:57.900 --> 35:01.700
burn me and cast my ashes
to a strong east wind.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.400
Don't touch their women.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.500
We don't mix with these people.

35:59.700 --> 36:03.200
What kind of offspring
do you think that would yield?

36:03.400 --> 36:05.000
Weak people.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.100
Half people.

36:08.700 --> 36:12.200
l will not have our Saxon blood
watered down by mixing with them.

36:12.500 --> 36:17.000
according to our laws, no man
may deny me the spoils of our conquest!

36:17.300 --> 36:19.200
He speaks the truth, Father.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
My lord! O, my lord!

36:40.200 --> 36:42.200
God's thanks, my lord.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.000
Thank you.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.800
Thank you.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.900
Kill her.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.400
No! No!

36:56.600 --> 36:59.200
are you challenging me?

37:00.700 --> 37:03.900
lf you want to challenge me,
you have to have a sword in your hand.

37:04.400 --> 37:09.000
as long as my heart beats,
l rule and you hold your tongue.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.700
Or l'll cut it out.

38:03.500 --> 38:08.400
To represent the holy court,
my trusted secretary, Horton...

38:08.700 --> 38:10.600
Horton?

38:11.700 --> 38:15.000
..will accompany you with your quest.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.800
jols, find him a horse.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.400
This way.

38:23.600 --> 38:27.500
Godspeed, as you fulfil
your duty to Rome.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.800
My duty is also to my men.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.800
Then get them home.

40:25.100 --> 40:28.500
We are three days' march from
the Great Wall, if we camp at night.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.000
We won't camp.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.800
The wall - what troops are stationed there?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.400
Light Roman infantry

40:36.600 --> 40:39.200
and possibly Sarmatian knights.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.000
arthur Castus is their leader.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.400
arthur? Who is this arthur?

40:43.500 --> 40:48.500
lt is said he has never been defeated
in battle. lt is said he is a great warrior.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.400
Why should l trust you?

40:53.800 --> 40:55.900
You're a traitor to your own people.

40:56.100 --> 40:59.400
Tell my father of the Roman estate.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.600
Speak up!

41:02.700 --> 41:05.300
a very high-ranking family live there.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.200
They are of great importance to Rome.

41:08.400 --> 41:12.500
Father, their ransom
could pay for the entire campaign.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.000
l'll attack from the north
with the main army.

41:26.300 --> 41:30.600
You bring your men down here.
Cut off their retreat to the south.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.800
burn every village, kill everybody.

41:34.800 --> 41:39.700
Never leave behind you a man, woman
or child who can ever carry a sword.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.900
Saxon.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.300
How many?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.400
Thousands.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.500
Woads. They're tracking us.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.500
Where?

42:23.700 --> 42:25.300
Everywhere.

43:07.100 --> 43:08.600
Get back!

43:08.900 --> 43:10.700
Get back!

43:25.400 --> 43:26.800
This way!

44:10.400 --> 44:12.300
What are you waiting for?

44:31.800 --> 44:33.500
lnish.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.700
Devil ghosts.

44:35.900 --> 44:40.800
- Why would they not attack?
- Merlin doesn't want us dead.

44:44.500 --> 44:47.500
We should have killed them, Merlin.

44:48.300 --> 44:52.200
There might be a purpose
for artorius and his Knights.

44:52.700 --> 44:53.400
No!

44:55.400 --> 44:56.800
He is our enemy!

45:00.100 --> 45:01.700
So is the Saxon!

45:24.400 --> 45:26.400
- Who are you?
- l am arthur Castus,

45:26.600 --> 45:30.300
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights,
sent by bishop Germanius of Rome.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.500
Open the gate.

45:40.400 --> 45:42.900
lt is a wonder you have come.

45:43.100 --> 45:46.600
Good jesus.
arthur and his knights.

45:48.900 --> 45:51.500
You have fought the Woads.
vile creatures.

45:51.700 --> 45:55.400
Our orders are to evacuate you
immediately.

45:55.700 --> 45:57.500
but that... that is impossible.

45:58.100 --> 46:01.400
- Which is alecto?
- l am alecto.

46:02.500 --> 46:04.800
alecto is my son.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.300
and everything we have is here in the land
given to us by the Pope of Rome.

46:09.600 --> 46:15.200
- Well, you're about to give it to the Saxons.
- They're invading from the north.

46:15.500 --> 46:18.300
- Then Rome will send an army.
- They have. Us.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.300
- We leave as soon as you're packed.
- l refuse to leave.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.200
Go back to work! all of you!

46:29.400 --> 46:32.000
- You heard! Go!
- all right, all right.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.600
- Go!
- Get back to work, all of you!

46:36.200 --> 46:38.100
Go back!

46:40.500 --> 46:44.000
lf l fail to bring you and your son back,
my men can never leave this land.

46:44.300 --> 46:45.900
So you're coming with me

46:46.100 --> 46:50.500
if l have to tie you to my horse and drag
you all the way to Hadrian's Wall myself.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.800
My lord.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.300
Lady, my knights are hungry.

46:58.300 --> 47:00.000
Go.

47:04.300 --> 47:05.700
Come!

47:11.400 --> 47:13.700
Come. Let us go, hm?

47:28.300 --> 47:31.600
Sir, you're famous.
You're arthur, aren't you?

47:31.800 --> 47:34.900
l'm Ganis. l'm a good fighter and l'm smart.
l'd serve you proudly.

47:36.300 --> 47:38.100
are you from Rome?

47:38.300 --> 47:40.200
From hell.

47:41.800 --> 47:44.600
- Sir.
- Who is this man?

47:44.800 --> 47:47.300
He's our village elder.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.800
What is this punishment for?

47:50.000 --> 47:53.500
- answer me!
- He defied our master, Marius.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.400
Most of the food we grow
is sent out by sea to be sold.

47:56.600 --> 47:59.300
He asked that we keep
a little more for ourselves, that's all.

47:59.500 --> 48:02.100
My arse has been snappin' at the grass
l'm so hungry!

48:02.300 --> 48:05.900
You're from Rome. ls it true
that Marius is a spokesman for God

48:06.200 --> 48:08.500
and that it's a sin to defy him?

48:11.900 --> 48:14.700
l tell you now.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.900
Marius is not of God.

48:17.100 --> 48:22.000
and you, all of you,
were free from your first breath!

48:31.000 --> 48:32.600
Help this man.

48:32.700 --> 48:35.100
Help him!

48:35.400 --> 48:39.400
Now hear me. a vast and terrible army
is coming this way.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.400
They will show no mercy, spare no one.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.500
Those of you who are able
should gather your things

48:44.700 --> 48:46.900
and begin to move south
towards Hadrian's Wall.

48:47.100 --> 48:49.500
Those unable shall come with us.

48:49.700 --> 48:52.400
You, serve me now.
Get these people ready.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.500
Right, you heard him.

48:54.600 --> 48:57.200
You go grab enough food and water
for the journey.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.100
Let's get a hurry on, else we're all dead!

49:05.200 --> 49:07.100
Come on, hurry.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.300
They have flanked us to the east.

49:12.500 --> 49:15.300
They're coming from the south,
trying to cut off our escape.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.000
They'll be here before nightfall.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.800
- How many?
- an entire army.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
and the only way out is to the south?

49:22.200 --> 49:23.500
East.

49:23.600 --> 49:27.000
There is a trail heading east
across the mountains.

49:27.800 --> 49:32.800
lt means we have to cross behind Saxon
lines, but that's the one we should take.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.600
arthur, who are all these people?

49:36.800 --> 49:38.700
They're coming with us.

49:40.600 --> 49:42.300
Then we'll never make it.

49:54.300 --> 49:56.200
- Come on, get back to work!
- back to work!

50:07.800 --> 50:09.500
Move.

50:09.800 --> 50:11.600
Move.

50:13.300 --> 50:15.200
Move!

50:16.400 --> 50:19.000
- What is this?
- You cannot go in there.

50:19.200 --> 50:22.100
No one goes in there.
This place is forbidden.

50:23.800 --> 50:26.800
What are you doing?
Stop this!

50:31.000 --> 50:32.400
arthur, we have no time.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.700
Do you not hear the drums?

50:39.400 --> 50:41.300
Dagonet.

51:00.400 --> 51:03.100
- Key.
- lt is locked.

51:03.300 --> 51:05.200
From the inside.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.800
You, you... go.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.400
Move!

51:30.100 --> 51:34.000
- Gawain.
- Exaudi OratiOnem meam.

51:35.900 --> 51:39.000
Exaudi OratiOnem meam.

51:39.200 --> 51:45.100
ln nOmine Dei Patris OmnipOtentis
et in virtute Spiritus Sancti.

51:47.400 --> 51:50.100
Who are these defilers
of the Lord's temple?

51:50.300 --> 51:52.200
Out of the way.

52:11.100 --> 52:12.800
The work of your god.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
ls this how he answers your prayers?

52:17.300 --> 52:19.400
See if there's any still alive.

52:27.100 --> 52:30.200
How dare you set foot in this holy place?

52:33.800 --> 52:36.800
- There was a man of God.
- Not my god!

52:38.400 --> 52:41.600
- This one's dead.
- by this smell, they are all dead.

52:41.900 --> 52:45.000
and you.
You even move, you join him.

52:51.600 --> 52:52.900
arthur!

52:57.400 --> 52:59.100
You must not fear me.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.900
Water! Give me some water!

53:55.000 --> 53:57.200
His arm is broken.

53:58.300 --> 54:00.300
and his family?

54:02.700 --> 54:04.900
She's a Woad.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
l'm a Roman officer.

54:09.900 --> 54:11.900
You're safe now.

54:13.200 --> 54:16.600
- You're safe.
- Stop what you are doing!

54:17.500 --> 54:18.800
What is this madness?

54:18.900 --> 54:21.600
- They're all pagans here!
- So are we.

54:21.900 --> 54:24.700
They refuse to do the task
God has set for them!

54:24.800 --> 54:26.400
They must die as an example!

54:26.600 --> 54:29.900
You mean they refused to be your serfs!

54:30.100 --> 54:31.800
You are a Roman.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.500
You understand.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.500
and you are a Christian.

54:35.700 --> 54:38.000
You! You kept her alive!

54:42.300 --> 54:44.700
- My lord!
- No! No, stop!

54:46.800 --> 54:50.600
When we get to the wall
you will be punished for this heresy.

54:50.900 --> 54:54.600
Perhaps l should kill you now
and seal my fate.

54:54.800 --> 54:57.600
l was willing to die with them.

54:57.700 --> 55:00.900
Yes, to lead them to their rightful place.

55:01.200 --> 55:04.500
lt is God's wish
that these sinners be sacrificed.

55:04.600 --> 55:07.100
Only then can their souls be saved.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.900
Then l shall grant his wish.

55:12.500 --> 55:15.300
- Wall them back up.
- arthur.

55:15.900 --> 55:17.400
l said wall them up!

55:17.500 --> 55:21.200
Don't you see it is the will of God
that these sinners be sacrificed?

55:21.500 --> 55:26.100
- Unhand me, defil... They're sinners!
- Get in there!

56:04.200 --> 56:06.100
We're moving too slow.

56:06.200 --> 56:08.500
The girl's not gonna make it,
and neither is the boy.

56:08.700 --> 56:11.800
The family we can protect, but we're
wasting our time with all these people.

56:12.100 --> 56:14.500
We're not leaving them.

56:14.700 --> 56:17.100
lf the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.

56:17.300 --> 56:19.700
Then save your anger for them.

56:20.900 --> 56:24.600
ls this Rome's quest or arthur's?

56:50.900 --> 56:52.800
- arthur.
- How is he?

56:53.800 --> 56:55.300
He burns.

56:56.700 --> 56:58.400
brave boy.

57:36.300 --> 57:39.300
Some of your fingers are out of place.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.400
l have to push them back.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.400
lf l don't do this, there's a chance
you may never use them again.

58:21.100 --> 58:23.000
They tortured me.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.700
With machines.

58:32.800 --> 58:38.000
To make me tell them things that...
that l didn't know to begin with.

58:40.700 --> 58:42.600
and then...

58:46.100 --> 58:48.400
l heard your voice in the dark.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.600
l am Guinevere.

58:56.800 --> 58:59.000
You are arthur...

59:00.200 --> 59:03.200
of the Knights from the Great Wall.

59:03.900 --> 59:05.600
l am.

59:06.400 --> 59:09.700
The famous briton
who kills his own people.

59:35.200 --> 59:38.900
l found tracks coming from the south,
but none going back.

59:39.200 --> 59:42.100
Horsemen travelling light and fast.

59:42.300 --> 59:44.100
Could be Roman cavalry.

59:44.300 --> 59:45.700
Could be knights.

59:48.300 --> 59:50.400
They know we're after them.

59:51.500 --> 59:54.200
They'll head east now,
through the mountains.

59:54.400 --> 59:58.900
God's holy work has been defiled.
l am a servant of God!

59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.800
No, please, l...

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.100
He says they walled him up in a building
and took the family.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.400
Someone who goes
by the name of artorius.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.200
lt's him.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.800
lt's arthur.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.600
Take your men east. Hunt them down.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:23.200
l'll take the main army to the wall.
bring the family there.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:27.000
- and the monks?
- Put them back where you found them.

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:29.400
l am a servant of God!

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.600
Please, l... l am a servant of God!

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.300
Unhand me, you defiler!

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.100
burn it all.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.000
My father told me great tales of you.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.600
Really?

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.700
and what did you hear?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.900
Fairy tales.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.700
The kind you hear about people so brave,
so selfless, that they can't be real.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.100
arthur and his knights.

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.200
a leader both briton and Roman.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.800
and yet you chose your allegiance
to Rome.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.600
To those who take
what does not belong to them.

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.000
That same Rome that took your men
from their homeland.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.500
Listen, lady, do not pretend
you know anything about me or my men.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.200
How many britons have you killed?

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.100
as many as tried to kill me. lt's the natural
state of any man to want to live.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:15.900
animals live! lt's a natural state of any man
to want to live free in their own country.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.900
l belong to this land.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.400
Where do you belong, arthur?

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.700
How's your hand?

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.300
l'll live, l promise you.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.500
ls there nothing about my land
that appeals to your heart?

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.000
Your own father married a briton.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.300
Even he must have found something
to his liking.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Saxons.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.600
We'll sleep here.
Take shelter in those trees.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.300
- Tristan.
- You wanna go out again? Yeah.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.300
'Tis a beautiful country, is it not?

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.900
lf you say so.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and where do you come from
that compares?

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.500
The black Sea?

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.200
This is heaven for me.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:12.500
l don't believe in heaven.
l've been living in this hell.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:18.100
but if you represent what heaven is,
then take me there.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.100
Rain and snow at once.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.300
a bad omen.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:13.800
lt is here, given to us by the Pope.
These people, they send an army for us.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:13.200
What was it like, your home?

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:20.700
We sacrificed goats, drank their blood,
danced naked round fires.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.800
What l do remember...

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Home...

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:51.600
Oceans of grass from horizon to horizon,
further than you can ride.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.400
The sky, bigger than you can imagine.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.800
No boundaries.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.500
Some people would call that freedom.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.000
That's what we fight for -
our land, our people.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.500
The right to choose our own destiny.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:20.500
So you see, Lancelot,
we are much alike, you and l.

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:33.500
and when you return home,
will you take a wife, have sons?

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.600
l have killed too many sons.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.400
What right do l have to my own?

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.100
No family, no religion.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.700
Do you believe in anything at all?

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.700
l would have left you
and the boy there to die.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.800
You betrayed me.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
He means you no harm.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.700
Peace between us this night,
arthur Castus.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.200
So Rome is leaving. The Saxon is come.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:31.500
The world we have known
and fought for is ended.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.600
Now we must make a new world.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.700
Your world, Merlin, not mine.
l shall be in Rome.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.100
To find peace?
The Saxon will come to Rome.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.700
My knights trust me
not to betray them to their enemy.

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:45.000
Rome was my enemy, not arthur.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.899
We have no fight between us now.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.300
You tell that to the knights
you killed before my eyes,

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.399
whose bones are buried in this earth.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.700
We have all lost brothers.

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:55.900
You know nothing of the loss l speak!

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.600
Shall l help you remember?

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.000
an attack on a village.
The screams of an innocent woman.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.600
Mother!

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.700
artorius!

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.300
Mother!

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.400
Mother!

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:28.800
l ran to the burial mound
of my father to free her.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.900
To kill you.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:41.300
Father, please let loose your sword.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.600
l feel the heat of that fire
on my face even now.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.000
l did not wish her dead.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.000
She was of our blood, as are you.

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:14.600
lf you were so determined to leave us
to slaughter, why did you save so many?

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.800
My men are strong,
but they have need of a true leader.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.200
They believe you can do anything.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.700
To defeat the Saxon
we need a master of war.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.900
Why do you think
l spared you in the forest?

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:42.500
That sword you carry is made of iron
from this earth, forged in the fires of britain.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:47.400
lt was love of your mother
that freed the sword, not hatred of me.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.000
Love, arthur.

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.600
- lt is your destiny.
- There is no destiny.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.200
There is only free will.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.900
and what of the free will of your knights?

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.500
Did they die in vain?

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.200
Seize him!

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.600
No!

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.500
No...

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.400
l have the boy!

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.100
- Kill him!
- No, don't! Let him go!

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.000
Kill him now!

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Down!

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.200
Your hands seem to be better.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.100
artorius!

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.200
Do we have a problem?

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.000
Huh?

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.400
You have a choice.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.200
You help or you die.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.900
Put down your weapons.

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.300
- Do it now!
- Yeah!

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.900
- How many did you kill?
- Four.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.700
Not a bad start to the day!

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.700
armour-piercing.
They're close. We have no time.

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.500
You ride ahead.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.500
l'm sorry for your loss.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.000
My father lost his way.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:24.000
He used to say the Church
is there to help us stay on our path.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.800
lt didn't help those he made suffer.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
The path he chose was beyond the reach
of the Church, alecto.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.400
but not of Rome. What my father believed,
so Rome believes.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.800
What, that some men are born
to be slaves? No, that isn't true.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.900
lt is so! He told me so.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.400
Pelagius, a man as close to me as any,
is there now,

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.300
teaching that all men are free, equal.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.900
and that each of us has the right
to choose his own destiny.

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.600
Teach? How?

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.300
They killed Pelagius a year past.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.200
Germanius and the others
were damned by his teachings.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.800
They had him excommunicated and killed.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:04.000
The Rome you talk of doesn't exist,

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.300
except in your dreams.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:37.000
- ls there any other way?
- No. We have to cross the ice.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:42.000
Get them all out of the carriages.
Tell them to spread out.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.100
- Knights...
- Well, l'm tired of running.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.300
and these Saxons are so close behind
my arse is hurtin'.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.400
Never liked
looking over my shoulder anyway.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.900
- be a pleasure to put an end to this racket.
- and finally get a look at the bastards.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.200
Here. Now.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.000
jols!

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.700
You two, take the horses.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.300
Ganis, l need you
to lead the people.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.100
The main Saxon army is inland,

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.900
so if you track the coastline till you're
well south of the wall, you'll be safe.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.200
- but you're seven against 200?
- Eight.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.400
You could use another bow.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.800
- l'd rather stay and fight.
- You'll get your chance soon enough.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.800
This man is now your captain.
You do as he says. am l understood?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
- Yes, sir.
- Go. Go!

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.100
Right. Come on, then! Move on!

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.600
l am able. l can fight.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.900
No. You must bear witness
to all you have seen.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.500
There's one thing you must do,
and that's get back to Rome.

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:49.800
Hold until l give the command.

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.000
You look frightened.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.500
There's a large number
of lonely men out there.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:02.100
Don't worry, l won't let them rape you.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.900
archer!

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:22.000
- We're out of range.
- l can see that!

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.000
l believe they're waiting for an invitation.
bors, Tristan.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.300
They're far out of range.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.700
aim for the wings of the ranks.
Make them cluster.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:41.200
- Hold the ranks!
- Hold the ranks! Hold the ranks!

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:47.600
- Hold the ranks!
- Hold the ranks!

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.400
Hold the ranks!
Hold the ranks, or l kill you myself!

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.100
lt's not gonna break. back.

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.800
Fall back!

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.800
Prepare for combat.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.600
- Dag!
- Cover him.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.200
- archers move! Move!
- Forward!

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:28.100
Move! Move! Kill him!

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.600
The ice is breaking!

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.500
Kill him!

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.800
Dag!

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.200
back! back!

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.200
Dag!

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.200
Pull back! arthur!

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.800
Kill him!

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.800
Help us!

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.400
Stay with me.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.700
Dagonet! Stay with me!

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.500
ah, God!

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:35.100
Christ be praised.
against all the odds Satan could muster.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.900
alecto, let me see you.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.900
- Kindly get out of my way!
- You have triumphed!

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.800
Young alecto, let me see you.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.500
You are here.

01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:48.000
- Lucan!
- You, boy! Stop!

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.600
Our great knights.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.300
You are free now!

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.800
Give me the papers. Come, come.

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:31.200
Your papers of safe conduct
throughout the Roman Empire.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.000
Take it, arthur.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.100
bishop Germanius.

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.400
Friend of my father.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.500
You are free now.

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.300
You can go.

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:09.300
bors.

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.000
bors!

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.600
For Dagonet.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.100
This doesn't make him a free man.

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.900
He's already a free man.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.600
He's dead!

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.400
Goodbye, old friend.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.600
We'll be along soon.

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:51.100
Let's drink.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.700
Get drunk.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.300
a grave with no sword.

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:22.200
lt was my father's wish
that if he died on this island,

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:27.100
he would be buried with his knights.

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:29.400
He died in battle?

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.700
lt's a family tradition.

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:42.000
l can see why you believe
that you have nothing left here.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.800
Except what you and your knights
have done.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
You have your deeds.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.600
Deeds in themselves are meaningless
unless they're for some higher purpose.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.000
We have waged a war
to protect a Rome that does not exist.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.300
ls that the deed l am to be judged by?

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.100
You stayed and fought
when you didn't have to.

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.700
You bloodied evil men
when you could have run.

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:08.500
You did all that for no reason?

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:16.200
Pelagius told me once
there is no worse death

01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.100
than the end of hope.

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.300
You and l are not the polite people
that live in poems.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.600
We are blessed and cursed by our times.

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:36.600
Perhaps the curse is of our own making.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.000
and the blessing.

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:43.700
What are you afraid of, arthur?

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.500
You're like this country -

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:56.700
britons with a Roman father.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.800
Rome is dead.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:05.700
This place, this land - your home -

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.600
is the last outpost of freedom,
of everything you hold dear.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.900
These are your people.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.000
Father, l have failed.

01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:55.800
You've lost the respect of the enemy.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.800
l offer my life for my disgrace.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.300
No.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.000
No, Son.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.900
Raewald.

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:41.100
You're second in charge now.

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:45.000
Yeah. You're like a son to me.

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.300
What tomorrow brings...

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.600
we cannot know.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.900
arthur, come to the wall now.

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:09.200
- The Saxons are here.
- Make way! Make way!

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.200
Knights, my journey with you
must end here.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.100
May God go with you.

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:15.900
arthur, this is not Rome's fight.

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.300
lt is not your fight.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.500
Stand fast!

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.500
all these long years we've been together,

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:30.600
the trials we've faced,
the blood we've shed.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.900
What was it all for,
if not for the reward of freedom?

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.700
and now when we are so close,
when it is finally within our grasp...

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.500
Look at me!

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:45.200
- Does it all count for nothing?
- You ask me that?

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.000
You who know me best of all?

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:54.800
Then do not do this.
Only certain death awaits you here.

01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:58.000
arthur, l beg you!
For our friendship's sake, l beg you!

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.500
You be my friend now
and do not dissuade me.

01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:03.100
Seize the freedom you have earned
and live it for the both of us.

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:06.400
l cannot follow you, Lancelot.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:10.300
l now know that all the blood l have shed,
all the lives l have taken

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.500
have led me to this moment.

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.900
Straight ahead!

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.600
artorius!

01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.100
Rus!

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.800
Rus!

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:27.200
The Roman auxiliary has left the wall.

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.500
- and the horsemen?
- Leading a caravan away from the fort.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:34.500
They're running south...
with their tails between their legs.

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:39.200
- So there will be no resistance.
- a few dozen villagers.

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:44.800
We're going to slaughter your people.

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.200
l think you should watch.

01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.600
Your tree might be a good place.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.700
Up on the hill!

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.500
a single knight.

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:10.100
Didn't you just say they were gone?
What is this, a ghost?

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:16.800
(chOking) One man. a tiny fly
on the back of your... great army.

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.000
Who is he?

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.400
arthur.

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:25.700
arthur.

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:28.900
arthur.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:46.200
arthur.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.800
Wherever l go on this wretched island
l hear your name.

01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:57.600
always half-whispered, as if you were a...

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.500
god.

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:08.700
all l see is flesh, blood.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.700
No more god than
the creature you're sitting on.

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.900
Speak your terms, Saxon.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.200
The Romans have left you.

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500
Who are you fighting for?

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.900
l fight for a cause
beyond Rome's or your understanding.

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:30.700
ah.

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.400
You come to beg a truce.
You should be on your knees.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.600
l came to see your face, so that l alone
may find you on the battlefield.

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.000
and it would be good for you
to mark my face, Saxon,

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:53.400
for the next time you see it, it will be
the last thing you see on this earth.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.200
ah, finally.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.500
a man worth killing.

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.600
Prepare the men for battle.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.600
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.500
Hey.

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:30.400
You're free.

01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:00.700
He's got a plan, this Roman.

01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:11.200
Send what's left of your infantry.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.300
- Do you want to kill my men?
- They're my men!

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.000
battle formation!

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:31.900
No. You stay here with me.

01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:44.600
Knights, the gift of freedom
is yours by right.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:52.200
but the home we seek
resides not in some distant land.

01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:56.700
lt's in us and in our actions on this day.

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:03.300
lf this be our destiny, then so be it.

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:09.800
but let history remember
that as free men we chose to make it so.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.500
Rus!

01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:22.900
There! On the hill!

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:49.100
Rus!

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.900
The knights are demons!

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:40.000
That is the gate to hell.

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:18.600
Raewald.

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:21.400
The left flank.

01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:26.800
- You go with him.
- Move out!

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:00.400
Shields up!

01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:31.500
Pull!

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:33.900
arthur...

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.400
lt was my life to be taken!

02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:04.500
Not this!

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:07.500
Never this!

02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:32.000
My brave knights, l have failed you.

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:37.200
l neither took you off this island,

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
nor shared your fate.

02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:21.900
For 200 years, knights had fought
and died for a land not our own.

02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:24.300
but on that day at badon Hill,

02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:28.900
all who fought put our lives
in service of a greater cause.

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:32.000
Freedom.

02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:13.800
arthur. Guinevere.

02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:17.100
Our people are one.

02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.400
as you are.

02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:34.000
Now l'm really gonna have
to marry your mother.

02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:36.700
Who said l'd have you?

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:58.200
King arthur!

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:00.700
Hail, arthur!

02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:10.900
Let every man, woman, child
bear witness

02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:16.700
that from this day all britons
will be united in one common cause.

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:24.200
arthur! arthur!

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.100
artorius!

02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:09.300
and as for the knights
who gave their lives,

02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.500
their deaths were cause
for neither mourning nor sadness.

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:15.800
For they will live forever,

02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:20.600
their names and deeds handed down
from father to son, mother to daughter,

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.300
in the legends of
King arthur and his knights.
