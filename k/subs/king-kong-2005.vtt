WEBVTT

02:00.187 --> 02:01.313
Move along.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.126
Oh!

03:06.153 --> 03:09.088
That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?

03:09.156 --> 03:10.384
It's hysterical, Manny.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.856
As long as we're laughing...

03:11.925 --> 03:13.358
we won't cry
over the box office.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.019
Talk about depressing.

03:15.095 --> 03:18.622
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around
like circus ponies.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.223
That's depressing.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.633
I love a good chorus line.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.232
What's this?
It's a play.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.798
Who wrote it, Annie?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.673
Some guy. Driscoll.

03:31.145 --> 03:32.373
Driscoll.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.311
From the Federal Theatre.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.748
Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got
an audience.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.354
It'll pick up.
Isn't that right, Manny?

03:45.059 --> 03:46.583
It always does.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.586
See you tomorrow.

03:48.662 --> 03:52.758
The trick is to
start to build right from
the back of your throat.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.459
Works well
out through the nose, too.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.334
Have you eaten today?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.599
Oh...

03:59.673 --> 04:01.971
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about me.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.236
Hey.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.274
You're all I've got.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.978
Come on, take me to dinner.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.978
Okay.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.186
You think the kitchen
will still be open
on Third?

04:15.422 --> 04:17.788
Soup and biscuits.
Perfect.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.792
Harry, what's going on?

04:28.068 --> 04:31.333
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.966
It's all right for you.
We haven't had a paycheck
in two weeks.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.703
How we gonna eat?

04:36.910 --> 04:39.902
They're not getting away
with this!
They just did.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.414
Ann, it's no use.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.413
The show, it's over.
It's done.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.482
I'm done.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.652
I'm leaving, Annie.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.419
I'm going back to Chicago.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.888
I'm sorry.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.626
I'm sorry, Annie.

05:02.603 --> 05:06.039
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.005
You gotta
think of yourself now.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.871
You should try out
for that part.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.948
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.918
Every time you reach out
for something
you care about...

05:21.989 --> 05:24.719
fate comes along
and snatches it away.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.383
But not this time, Annie.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.485
Not this time.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.767
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
Oh, jeez.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.905
Look, miss,
I told you already,
call my office.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.907
Leave your résumé
with my secretary.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.035
Now, why would I want to
do that when we can
talk about it in person?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.739
Because that's what
a smart girl would do.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.282
But I already
sent you my résumé.
You returned it unopened.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.375
What can I say? Jack
Driscoll's very particular
about who he works with.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.114
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.382
Jesus, you don't give up,
do you?

05:55.456 --> 05:57.014
Mr. Weston,
I know this role backwards.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.059
Well, that's too bad,
'cause we just gave the part
to someone else.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.527
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.294
I know times are tough.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.360
You want my advice?

06:10.637 --> 06:13.765
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.469
A girl like you
doesn't have to starve.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.170
There's a new place.
It just opened.

06:25.786 --> 06:29.381
Now listen, princess,
this gig ain't the Palace,
you understand?

06:29.456 --> 06:32.448
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.151
Just play the date,
take the money...

06:37.130 --> 06:39.121
forget you was ever there.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.196
How much more is there?

07:11.732 --> 07:13.461
Another five reels.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.165
Lights up.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.441
This is it?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.342
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

07:27.414 --> 07:29.041
Another one of your
safari pictures?

07:29.116 --> 07:32.210
You promised us romantic
scenes with Bruce Baxter
and Maureen McKenzie!

07:32.286 --> 07:33.981
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.646
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date...

07:35.722 --> 07:37.280
so she could
get her teeth fixed.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.190
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.820
Carl,
you've been in production
for over two months.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.558
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up
the screen...

07:45.632 --> 07:47.532
once we get them on the ship.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.633
What ship?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.531
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

07:52.606 --> 07:56.406
What location? Carl!
You're supposed to be
shooting on the back lot.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.000
Yes, I understand that.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.444
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

08:00.514 --> 08:01.776
and I'll tell you why.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.681
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.878
Life intervened.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.346
I've come into possession
of a map.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.788
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.988
A place that was
thought to exist
only in myth.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.322
Until now.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.424
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.832
Is he asking for more money?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.497
He's asking us
to fund a wild-goose chase.

08:25.572 --> 08:30.032
I'm talking about
a primitive world
never before seen by man.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.203
The ruins
of an entire civilization.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.383
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.909
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.289
Will there be boobies?

08:47.527 --> 08:48.755
Boobies?

08:49.229 --> 08:51.925
Jigglies. Jiblonkas.
Bazooms.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.794
In my experience,
people only go
to these films...

08:54.868 --> 08:58.235
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.872
What are you, an idiot?

08:59.940 --> 09:03.137
You think they asked De Mille
if he would waste his time
on nudie shots?

09:03.210 --> 09:06.839
No! They respected
the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

09:06.913 --> 09:10.371
Not that you'd know
what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

09:14.554 --> 09:17.148
Would you step out
for a moment, Carl?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.393
Zelman and Associates.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.634
Give me that, quick.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.332
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

09:36.410 --> 09:40.540
Preston, you have
a lot to learn about
the motion picture business.

09:43.483 --> 09:46.077
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

09:46.153 --> 09:49.088
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.454
He's had a lot of
near-success.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.960
He's a preening self-promoter.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.326
An ambitious no-talent.
The guy's got "loser"
written all over him.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.887
I understand
your disappointment...

09:58.965 --> 10:01.092
He can't direct.
He doesn't have the smarts.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.966
He's washed up.
It's all over town.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.467
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.372
The animal footage has value.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.877
Sure. Universal are
desperate for stock footage.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.345
Then sell it!
Scrap the picture.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.779
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.280
Get him back in.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.915
Mr. Denham.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.126
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.324
No, Carl,
you can't do this.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.560
Tell them the studio
pressured us into
an early departure.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.659
It's not ethical!
What are they gonna do,
sue me?

10:36.737 --> 10:37.829
They can get in line.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.337
I'm not gonna let them
kill my film.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.842
You realize that none of
the camera equipment
is on board?

10:42.909 --> 10:45.707
We have no permits,
no visas.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.406
That's why I have you,
Preston.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.574
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.583
In fact, we have
no currency of any kind.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.640
He's there.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.550
Get in there.
Who's gonna pay
for the ship?

10:54.621 --> 10:55.713
Get in.

10:58.525 --> 11:02.188
You get out of there!
Come here!
Step on it! Step on it!

11:02.262 --> 11:05.322
Get out!
You're finished, Denham!

11:08.235 --> 11:11.534
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice
at this.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.167
I'm real good
at crapping the crappers.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.602
Red Label, 80% proof...

11:18.678 --> 11:20.509
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade."

11:20.580 --> 11:21.638
You got it.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.081
Tell Maureen
she doesn't have six hours
to put on her face.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.449
If she wants to be
in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.148
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.917
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

11:32.993 --> 11:35.086
Yesterday. I told you.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.794
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.855
That's what you told her.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.927
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

11:43.003 --> 11:47.303
God damn it, Preston,
all you had to do was
look her in the eye and lie.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.099
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.610
She's unavailable.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.511
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow?
Mae West?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.874
You'll never get her
into a size four.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.511
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into
Maureen's costumes.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.083
Fay's a size four.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.649
Yes, she is, but she's
doing a picture with RKO.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.728
Cooper, huh?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.261
I might have known.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.036
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.571
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.072
Not an option.
Carl.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.608
I said I'd find a girl.

12:22.676 --> 12:24.940
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

12:25.011 --> 12:27.844
Call Jack. I need that
goddamn screenplay!

12:29.716 --> 12:31.775
Defeat is always momentary.

13:05.719 --> 13:06.811
What?

14:01.107 --> 14:04.406
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.010
Excuse me.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.547
Ma'am,
I think you dropped this.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.788
Vaudeville, huh?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.888
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.763
If you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.301
Mr. Denham...

14:30.337 --> 14:31.326
I want you to know...

14:31.404 --> 14:34.202
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity
from strangers.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.139
Or, for that matter...

14:36.776 --> 14:38.767
taking things
that don't belong to me.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.745
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.782
It's just that
I haven't been paid
in a while.

14:42.849 --> 14:46.250
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?

14:49.356 --> 14:52.723
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.286
No, no. Oh, God, no.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.889
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.059
I'm not that type
of person at all.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.830
What type of person are you?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.872
I'm someone
you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

15:06.940 --> 15:11.001
Believe me, I am on
the level. No funny business.
Please sit down.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.643
Please. Please.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.642
Okay.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.178
Ann, I want you to imagine...

15:22.255 --> 15:24.917
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.289
You're filming
in the Far East?

15:27.527 --> 15:28.858
Singapore.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.695
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.595
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.367
And she can't
escape the feeling that
forces beyond her control...

15:41.441 --> 15:45.343
are compelling her
down a road from which
she cannot draw back.

15:45.645 --> 15:49.604
It's as if her whole life
has been a prelude
to this moment...

15:51.451 --> 15:55.353
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.984
And sure enough, against
her better judgment...

16:00.260 --> 16:01.750
She falls in love.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.520
Yes.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.654
But she doesn't trust it.

16:05.899 --> 16:08.800
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.260
Uh...

16:11.337 --> 16:12.531
really?

16:12.705 --> 16:15.071
If she loves someone,
it's doomed.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.540
Why is that?

16:17.043 --> 16:19.534
Good things never last,
Mr. Denham.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.617
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.212
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under
some time pressure.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.724
Well, I really...
Ann, I'm telling you...

16:32.792 --> 16:34.123
you're perfect. Look at you.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.185
You're the saddest girl
I've ever met.

16:36.262 --> 16:40.358
You're gonna make them weep,
Ann. You're gonna
break their hearts.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.726
See, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Denham.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.397
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.033
Good luck with your picture.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.440
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

16:54.514 --> 16:55.913
I'm offering you money.

16:55.982 --> 16:59.645
Adventure, fame,
the thrill of a lifetime,
and a long sea voyage.

16:59.719 --> 17:00.811
You want to read a script?

17:00.887 --> 17:03.947
Jack Driscoll's turning in
a draft as we speak.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.326
Jack Driscoll?

17:07.393 --> 17:08.723
Sure. Why?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.786
Wait. You know him?

17:11.897 --> 17:15.425
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.502
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

17:17.569 --> 17:20.596
Jack Driscoll does not
want just anyone
starring in this picture.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.038
He said to me, "Carl...

17:22.108 --> 17:25.474
"somewhere out there
is a woman
born to play this role."

17:25.545 --> 17:27.944
And as soon as I saw you,
I knew.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.581
Knew what?

17:33.586 --> 17:35.850
It was always
going to be you.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.367
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.028
Keep the change.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.872
Is this
the moving picture ship?

17:57.477 --> 17:58.876
Not exactly.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.378
It's actually
this one over here.

18:10.924 --> 18:15.054
Don't let appearances
deceive you. It's much more
spacious on board.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.990
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.156
This is all of it?
Yeah.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.824
We're taking
the Bell & Howell?
Yeah.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.596
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.228
Carl!
Yes!

18:25.305 --> 18:27.671
Get it on board, fellows,
come on.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.468
It's bad, it's bad.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.445
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.641
Who?
Men in uniform.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.809
The studio called the cops.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.312
Englehorn! Cast off!

18:43.389 --> 18:45.289
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...

18:45.358 --> 18:47.417
whatever the hell it is
you do. We gotta leave!

18:47.493 --> 18:49.154
I cannot do that.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.496
We are waiting
on the manifest.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.032
What? Who? English, please.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.165
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.865
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.373
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.606
Can we talk about this later?

19:04.677 --> 19:07.510
Can't you see
we're in the company
of a VIP guest?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.616
Ma'am.

19:15.521 --> 19:16.886
Ann Darrow.

19:18.057 --> 19:21.049
So you are ready
for this voyage, Miss Darrow?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.419
Sure.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.558
Nervous?

19:28.201 --> 19:30.101
Nervous? No.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.403
Why? Should I be?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.570
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

19:39.245 --> 19:42.646
Why don't I show
Miss Darrow to her cabin?

19:43.149 --> 19:45.515
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.019
Miss Darrow,
if you would just...

19:49.956 --> 19:53.414
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.527
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

19:57.130 --> 19:58.859
Do I have a choice?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.432
Please follow me.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.765
If there's anything
that you...
Excuse me, fellows.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.738
If there's anything
that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.591
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, you scared me.

20:28.661 --> 20:33.064
Listen. If anyone comes
to the door, don't open it.
You haven't seen me.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.724
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.997
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.997
You want one?
No. I can't stay, Carl.

20:41.074 --> 20:44.100
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.343
What's this?
It's the script.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.110
This is a script?

20:52.719 --> 20:54.983
Jack, this is 15 pages.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.682
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages
there, Carl.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.748
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.226
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.320
No, Jack, you can't
do this to me.
I have a beginning...

21:04.397 --> 21:06.991
but I need a middle
and an end. I gotta have
something to shoot.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.263
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.232
All right, fine.
We might as well settle up.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.110
You're gonna pay me?

21:20.179 --> 21:22.113
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

21:24.317 --> 21:27.115
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.017
How's $2,000 sound?

21:30.690 --> 21:32.123
Sounds great.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.920
I thought it might.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.518
Sounds great.
Okay.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.394
Raise the spring line!

21:39.465 --> 21:41.057
Watch the aft!

21:49.609 --> 21:51.201
And voilà.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.072
Thanks.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.941
You've written "two grand."

22:00.119 --> 22:03.782
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from
the beginning.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.557
"Two thousand dollars."

22:14.467 --> 22:16.128
It is the 29th, isn't it?

22:16.202 --> 22:19.000
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.602
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.835
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me
when you get back.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.275
All right.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.751
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

22:41.828 --> 22:46.322
And may I just say how
excited we are to have you
back with us, sir?

22:46.432 --> 22:48.195
Be a sport
and lend a hand here,
would you?

22:48.267 --> 22:50.735
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...

22:53.339 --> 22:54.533
Christ!

22:55.341 --> 22:57.241
Appreciate the help, fellow.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.437
Let me get the door for you.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.704
Welcome to your
stateroom, sir.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.313
Dead slow ahead both,
Mr. Hayes.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.323
Dead slow ahead both,
Captain.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.666
Oh, Christ!

23:31.077 --> 23:32.476
God damn it!

23:40.887 --> 23:44.323
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.

23:47.326 --> 23:48.850
Oh, no! No!

23:50.296 --> 23:53.094
You're much better off
sticking with film.

23:53.332 --> 23:55.766
I don't do it
for the money, Carl.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.364
I happen to love the theater.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.295
No, you don't.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.566
If you really loved it...

24:05.011 --> 24:06.603
you would have jumped.

24:10.383 --> 24:12.283
You! This is your fault!

24:26.699 --> 24:29.862
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light,
fresh straw.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.961
Jesus. What do you keep
down here?

24:32.038 --> 24:34.370
Lion, tiger, hippo,
you name it.

24:35.408 --> 24:37.137
You sell them to zoos?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.801
Zoo, circus.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.706
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.975
Careful. Camel have
bad accident on floor.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.812
Stain unremovable.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.423
Skipper catch
any wild animal you want.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.391
He'll do you real good price
on white rhino.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.552
Choy.

24:57.863 --> 25:01.230
My apologies for not being
able to offer you a cabin.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.098
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?

25:05.304 --> 25:06.635
Spoiled for choice.

25:06.706 --> 25:09.436
What are you, Mr. Driscoll?
A lion?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.238
Or a chimpanzee?

25:13.713 --> 25:15.340
I'll take this one.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.955
I told you to lock it up.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.556
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
Lumpy doesn't
give the orders!

25:33.633 --> 25:36.693
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

25:40.006 --> 25:41.803
Get them out of here.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.811
Compliments of the chef.
Okay.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.209
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.119
Lamb's brains
in walnut sauce.

26:35.795 --> 26:36.955
Jimmy.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.131
You run those ropes
up on deck like I told you?

26:39.198 --> 26:41.189
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

26:41.500 --> 26:45.402
How about you return
Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

26:53.212 --> 26:55.077
He don't mean no harm.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.071
Thanks.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.912
I'll keep him
out of your way.
It's okay.

26:58.984 --> 27:01.509
It's just that
he likes it down here.

27:01.587 --> 27:04.181
It's where I found him
four years ago.

27:04.523 --> 27:07.117
Stowed away
in one of them back cages.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.828
His arm was broken
in two places.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.898
He was wilder than
half the animals in here.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.395
Still won't tell me
where he came from.

27:19.572 --> 27:21.699
But it wasn't anyplace good.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.367
You got to straighten up.

27:26.645 --> 27:27.805
Jimmy.

27:28.614 --> 27:31.606
You don't want to
be on this ship
the rest of your life.

27:31.684 --> 27:34.050
Yes, I do.
No, you don't, Jimmy.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.619
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.623
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

27:38.691 --> 27:40.818
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.450
I've been reading.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.092
Where'd you get this?

27:47.433 --> 27:48.422
I borrowed it.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.871
On long-term loan.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.806
Look at this. Look, look.

27:55.875 --> 27:59.140
"Adventures on
a tramp steamer."
See? Just like us.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.846
It's so nice to meet you,
Mr. Driscoll.

28:09.555 --> 28:12.422
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.558
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.599
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.896
I'm a huge fan.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.904
I've read everything
you've ever written.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.439
No, too much.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.406
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.476
Seagulls.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.641
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.876
I don't care, Mike.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.351
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.620
Ann! Come on in.
Let me introduce you
to the crew.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.886
This is Herb, the cameraman.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.156
Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
Likewise.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.391
May I say
what a lovely dress?

28:53.465 --> 28:56.366
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.

28:56.869 --> 28:59.394
Isn't that
one of Maureen's costumes?

28:59.772 --> 29:03.503
Now, what does a girl
have to do around here
to get some breakfast?

29:03.576 --> 29:05.601
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

29:05.678 --> 29:09.136
Fancy my porridge
à la walnuts?

29:13.252 --> 29:15.880
Oh, Ann, I don't believe
you've met...

29:18.290 --> 29:19.348
Ann?

29:19.825 --> 29:22.988
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.896
Thrilled to meet you.
It's an honor to be
a part of this.

29:33.138 --> 29:34.537
Gee, thanks.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.041
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.671
Really?

29:40.479 --> 29:42.538
Yes,
and what I most admire...

29:42.615 --> 29:46.244
is the way
you've captured the voice
of the common people.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.283
Well, that's my job.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.523
I'm sure you've heard
this before, Mr. Driscoll...

29:54.593 --> 29:56.060
if you don't mind me
saying...

29:56.128 --> 29:59.188
but you don't look at all
like your photograph.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.031
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Ann...

30:06.105 --> 30:08.903
He's so much
younger in person.
And much better-looking.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.601
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.837
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

30:12.912 --> 30:15.710
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.614
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...

30:17.683 --> 30:21.414
the tweedy twerp
with his nose in his book
and his head up his a...

30:25.624 --> 30:28.320
It's nice to meet you, too,
Miss Darrow.

30:42.207 --> 30:43.606
Good Christ!

31:10.102 --> 31:12.070
She's standing
at the railing.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.661
She doesn't know it yet...

31:14.907 --> 31:18.399
but they are sailing
towards disaster.
You got that?

31:18.577 --> 31:20.306
Okay, so she turns...

31:21.613 --> 31:23.513
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

31:24.850 --> 31:27.444
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.

31:27.519 --> 31:30.454
Wait a sec. We're killing off
the first mate?

31:30.990 --> 31:33.185
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

31:33.258 --> 31:36.091
Come on, Jack.
It was an honest mistake.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.721
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened
to anyone.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.389
I was joking, Carl.

31:40.466 --> 31:43.765
The point is,
she's horrified.
She has to look away.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.599
And that's when she sees it.

31:50.776 --> 31:52.141
Sees what?

31:53.412 --> 31:54.504
What?

32:00.052 --> 32:01.417
The island.

32:05.124 --> 32:09.527
We're filming on an island
now? When did this happen?

32:10.262 --> 32:12.696
Jack, keep your voice down.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.759
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.361
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.463
All right.
It has a local name...

32:21.540 --> 32:24.065
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.839
They call it Skull Island.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.640
Did you get that?

32:29.448 --> 32:30.779
What's wrong
with this place?

32:30.849 --> 32:33.579
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

32:33.786 --> 32:37.153
Because, technically,
it hasn't been
discovered yet.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.526
Okay. All right.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.992
So we arrive at this place.

32:46.598 --> 32:47.792
S...

32:48.434 --> 32:49.628
K...

32:50.669 --> 32:52.034
U...

32:53.038 --> 32:54.232
L...

32:55.741 --> 32:57.003
L...

33:02.481 --> 33:03.846
Island.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.214
All right, everyone,
from the top! And action!

33:12.791 --> 33:16.454
I think this is
awfully exciting! I've never
been on a ship before.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.122
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.656
I guess you don't think
much of women
on ships, do you?

33:23.035 --> 33:24.696
No, they're a nuisance.

33:24.770 --> 33:28.433
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

33:36.715 --> 33:37.773
Cut!

33:38.884 --> 33:40.249
It's great.

33:40.385 --> 33:44.617
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.591
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

33:47.726 --> 33:51.218
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some
flow now, huh?

33:51.296 --> 33:53.127
It was pure effluence.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.961
I beefed up the banter.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.160
Try to resist that impulse.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.464
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.006
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?

34:02.074 --> 34:03.268
Actors.

34:04.409 --> 34:07.708
Travel the world,
but all they ever see
is a mirror.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.523
Good legs.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.789
Sea legs.
Well, you know, sea legs.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.391
Yeah.

34:29.467 --> 34:33.097
Not that you don't
have good legs.
Just making conversation.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.469
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

34:37.442 --> 34:39.967
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

34:40.045 --> 34:41.876
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...

34:41.947 --> 34:45.974
but Mr. Baxter
felt very strongly that
when a man likes a woman...

34:46.618 --> 34:48.279
he must ignore her.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.219
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

34:52.090 --> 34:53.284
No?

34:53.358 --> 34:55.087
Interesting theory.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.819
I know. I should have...

34:57.963 --> 35:00.193
It wasn't
what I had intended, but...

35:00.265 --> 35:01.789
I'm sorry. I was...

35:01.867 --> 35:03.858
And you made it your own.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.326
I was nervous.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.166
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.406
Please don't say
another word. Good night.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.876
Miss Darrow.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.713
You don't have to be nervous.

36:32.257 --> 36:33.588
Thank you.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.120
Let's take it...

36:36.228 --> 36:38.526
Would you please...
We're trying to
shoot a scene.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.224
Okay.
Thank you.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.758
Okay, again.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.510
We're close. Turn southwest.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.147
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

37:04.089 --> 37:06.614
It takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.183
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.458
I'll make it
worth your while.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.790
There's nothing out there.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.935
Well,
then you've nothing to lose.

37:30.982 --> 37:34.941
If someone were to tell you
this ship was headed
for Singapore...

37:36.421 --> 37:38.150
what would you say?

37:38.256 --> 37:41.020
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.519
Well, we turned southwest
last night.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.392
Gentlemen, please.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.325
We're not looking
for trouble.
No.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.071
You're looking
for something else.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.842
Yes, we are.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.879
We're going to find
Skull Island.

38:04.483 --> 38:07.316
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

38:08.320 --> 38:12.086
For 25 cents,
you get to see the last
blank space on the map.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.686
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.622
What do you mean?

38:19.364 --> 38:21.958
Seven years ago,
me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage...

38:22.033 --> 38:23.591
on a Norwegian bark.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.501
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.603
He'd been drifting for days.

38:28.673 --> 38:32.074
His ship had run aground
on an island
way west of Sumatra.

38:32.144 --> 38:35.602
An island hidden in fog.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.646
He spoke of a huge wall...

38:40.919 --> 38:42.682
built so long ago...

38:43.188 --> 38:45.213
no one knew who'd made it.

38:45.457 --> 38:48.358
A wall 100 foot high...

38:48.627 --> 38:51.460
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

38:53.231 --> 38:55.222
Why'd they build the wall?

38:59.671 --> 39:03.334
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

39:03.775 --> 39:05.868
neither beast nor man...

39:06.378 --> 39:09.643
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.042
A lion or a tiger.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.316
A man-eater. That's how
all these stories start.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.184
What else did he say?

39:17.522 --> 39:18.648
Nothing.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.487
We found him
the next morning. He'd stuck
a knife through his heart.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.822
Mmm-hmm.

39:22.994 --> 39:26.054
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do
better than that.

39:27.299 --> 39:29.563
Monsters belong in B movies.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.659
If you find this place...

39:32.170 --> 39:35.606
if you go ashore
with your friends
and your cameras...

39:36.775 --> 39:38.470
you won't come back.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.969
Just as long as
you understand that.

41:01.826 --> 41:04.693
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

41:10.302 --> 41:12.532
You're writing a stage comedy?

41:12.671 --> 41:14.571
I'm writing it for you.

41:16.741 --> 41:18.606
Why would you do that?

41:19.544 --> 41:22.411
Why would I write
a play for you?
Yes.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.676
Isn't it obvious?

41:28.420 --> 41:29.751
Not to me.

41:33.592 --> 41:34.786
Well...

41:36.328 --> 41:38.125
it's in the subtext.

41:40.865 --> 41:43.095
I guess
I must have missed it.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.003
It's not about words.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.142
Message for you, Captain.

42:53.538 --> 42:55.165
What's going on?

42:55.940 --> 42:58.773
Hayes,
why are we changing course?

43:00.345 --> 43:02.609
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.

43:06.685 --> 43:09.279
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.

43:09.621 --> 43:11.248
Did you know that?

43:13.692 --> 43:16.320
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

43:20.498 --> 43:23.797
Another week.
I haven't got a film yet.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.867
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

43:27.939 --> 43:31.204
No, Denham.
You risked everything I have.

43:33.111 --> 43:34.373
What do you want?

43:34.446 --> 43:36.710
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

43:36.781 --> 43:38.715
I want you off my ship.

43:41.252 --> 43:43.777
Set a course for Rangoon,
Mr. Hayes.

43:50.395 --> 43:51.862
I'm finished.

43:53.331 --> 43:55.196
It's over for me, Jack.

43:56.935 --> 43:59.426
How'd you think
this would end, Carl?

44:15.153 --> 44:18.589
Check our position.
Use the stars.

44:32.237 --> 44:34.364
There are no stars, Captain.

44:36.808 --> 44:38.207
What is that?

44:40.178 --> 44:42.271
What?
That.

44:46.251 --> 44:47.912
That right there.

44:48.953 --> 44:51.717
I don't know.
What is it? A coffee stain?

46:30.054 --> 46:33.888
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth
by lead line.

46:34.192 --> 46:35.659
Aye, Captain.

46:46.971 --> 46:49.098
30 fathoms, no bottom!

46:50.942 --> 46:53.911
Reduce speed,
steerage way only.

46:54.679 --> 46:56.544
Dead slow ahead, both.

46:59.584 --> 47:01.575
You should stop the ship.

47:02.954 --> 47:04.751
15 degrees port.

47:07.625 --> 47:09.354
We're getting out of here,
Mr. Hayes.

47:09.427 --> 47:11.554
We'll find clear conditions.

47:12.230 --> 47:13.754
We have seabed!

47:19.504 --> 47:20.994
25 fathoms!

47:22.874 --> 47:24.341
We're shallowing!

47:24.409 --> 47:25.774
20 degrees starboard!

47:25.843 --> 47:27.902
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

47:27.979 --> 47:29.606
Get me another reading!

47:32.850 --> 47:34.442
Another reading!

47:36.988 --> 47:38.717
22 fathoms!

47:40.258 --> 47:42.317
Douse the lights.
Aye, Captain.

47:54.339 --> 47:55.738
10 fathoms!

48:07.318 --> 48:10.116
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

48:27.372 --> 48:28.862
Stop engines!

49:32.170 --> 49:33.967
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

49:34.038 --> 49:36.131
Half astern both, Captain!

49:40.711 --> 49:41.905
Rocks!

49:45.016 --> 49:46.176
Rocks!

49:50.755 --> 49:52.916
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

49:53.424 --> 49:55.790
To port! Rocks everywhere!

49:55.960 --> 49:57.552
Take the wheel, Hayes.

50:14.712 --> 50:15.940
Hang on!

50:39.403 --> 50:40.768
Full ahead!

50:46.577 --> 50:48.477
Rocks to port, Captain!

50:49.447 --> 50:52.211
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

51:11.669 --> 51:12.931
Ah!

52:19.637 --> 52:21.229
Shore up that breach!

52:21.305 --> 52:24.570
Get me more men
down here now!
Come on, move, move!

52:26.611 --> 52:28.909
Hayes!
She's taken a pounding!

52:31.182 --> 52:32.615
What about the prop?

52:32.683 --> 52:34.878
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

52:34.952 --> 52:37.182
But she struck hard
against the rock!

52:38.189 --> 52:39.417
Captain!

52:40.091 --> 52:41.854
Better come up quick!

52:43.728 --> 52:45.127
Right there!

52:59.944 --> 53:02.037
Want me to bring them back?

53:02.680 --> 53:04.375
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.

53:04.448 --> 53:07.940
I want this ship fixed
and ready to float
on the next high tide!

53:08.019 --> 53:09.646
Come on, move it.

53:10.821 --> 53:12.812
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

53:20.231 --> 53:22.324
Can you believe this, Jack?

53:25.636 --> 53:27.501
We've got our picture.

54:25.129 --> 54:27.825
Why does Marlow
keep going up the river?

54:29.200 --> 54:31.191
Why doesn't he turn back?

54:33.637 --> 54:36.470
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

54:37.808 --> 54:40.971
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

54:42.780 --> 54:44.873
But there's another part...

54:46.016 --> 54:47.745
that needs to know.

54:50.988 --> 54:53.821
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

54:55.693 --> 54:58.992
"We could not understand
because we were too far...

54:59.864 --> 55:01.058
<i>"and could not remember...</i>

55:01.132 --> 55:04.659
<i>"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages...</i>

55:05.503 --> 55:07.801
<i>"of those ages
that are gone...</i>

55:09.006 --> 55:11.702
<i>"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories.</i>

55:14.578 --> 55:15.806
<i>"We are accustomed to look...</i>

55:15.880 --> 55:19.043
<i>"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster...</i>

55:21.519 --> 55:23.009
<i>"but there...</i>

55:24.388 --> 55:28.154
<i>"there you could look
at a thing
monstrous and free."</i>

55:38.169 --> 55:40.399
It's not
an adventure story...

55:40.971 --> 55:42.598
is it, Mr. Hayes?

55:44.608 --> 55:45.939
No, Jimmy.

55:47.044 --> 55:48.443
It's not.

56:10.935 --> 56:13.335
It's deserted.
Of course it's deserted.

56:13.404 --> 56:16.840
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

56:18.275 --> 56:21.073
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

57:34.952 --> 57:37.443
Mr. Denham,
I think we should go back.

57:37.521 --> 57:39.250
I will handle this.

57:44.695 --> 57:46.322
Look. Chocolate.

57:47.565 --> 57:49.294
You like chocolate?

57:52.069 --> 57:53.730
It's good to eat.

57:56.073 --> 57:57.335
You want?

58:03.347 --> 58:04.575
Take it.

58:12.323 --> 58:14.689
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.

58:20.764 --> 58:23.198
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

58:23.267 --> 58:25.565
She doesn't want
the chocolate.

58:27.538 --> 58:28.766
Aah!

58:50.794 --> 58:52.159
All right!

58:52.529 --> 58:55.020
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!

58:56.834 --> 58:58.461
They're harmless!

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:21.275
Ann!

01:01:48.772 --> 01:01:49.864
Jack.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.486
Seen enough?

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:14.991
Lighten the ship!

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:19.162
Anything that's not
bolted down goes overboard!

01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:22.995
Just heave it!

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.768
We got away.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.571
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.

01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:30.409
What about Mike?
He didn't get away!
He's still there!

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:34.413
Mike died doing
what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:38.545
And I'll tell you
something else. I'm gonna
finish this film for Mike!

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:46.622
I'll finish it...

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:50.830
and I'll donate
the proceeds...

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:53.332
to his wife and kids.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:57.331
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

01:02:58.175 --> 01:02:59.540
Hear, hear!

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:40.448
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:48.822
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.692
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.341
Drop those
spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

01:04:24.761 --> 01:04:25.921
Where's Ann?
What?

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:27.156
Where's Ann?

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:33.525
Ann!

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:54.654
She's free!

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:03.592
Full ahead, both engines!

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:12.307
Ann!

01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:37.799
No! Stop! Turn back!

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:40.364
Stop!

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.069
We have to turn back.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:45.935
They've taken Ann.

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:53.440
No!

01:05:58.355 --> 01:06:01.449
Kong! Kong! Kong!

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:47.535
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:51.273
Jump to it!
Jump to it, gentlemen!

01:06:54.945 --> 01:06:56.674
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:05.750
Come on, move it!

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:24.433
Pull harder!

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.675
Row! Row!

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:29.072
Come on!

01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:17.018
Kong.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.199
Spread out! Find her!

01:10:50.013 --> 01:10:51.378
Miss Darrow!

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.379
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!

01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:58.845
Ann!

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:02.753
She's here somewhere!

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:09.295
What in God's name was that?

01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:17.264
Behind the wall!

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:19.599
Behind the wall!

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:12.626
She's gone!

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:25.369
Carl, what is it?

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:33.676
You saw something.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:43.655
You can take Hayes
and 15 others.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.124
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:49.688
The rest of you
stay with the ship.

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:50.891
Choy!

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:54.227
Not you, Jimmy.

01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:56.464
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.302
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.705
Stay here.

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.678
Miss Darrow needs me!
No!

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.916
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:12.420
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:15.289
The wide-angle
will do just fine.

01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:24.232
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:26.498
And you got 24 hours!

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.403
24 hours?

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:30.799
This time tomorrow,
we haul anchor.

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:55.788
Miss Darrow!

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.293
Ann!

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:04.104
Miss Darrow!

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:13.744
Miss Darrow!

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.461
What is it?

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.272
Fire!

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.614
Cut it out.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:50.343
Hold your fire.

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:52.111
Hold your fire!

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:25.119
Stay down, damn it.
Stay down.

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:44.000
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:17.596
Good shooting, Mr. Hayes.

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:24.145
Aren't these things supposed
to be extinct?

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:25.714
They are now.

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:34.049
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.004
Miss Darrow!

01:16:55.712 --> 01:16:56.770
Ann!

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:13.310
No!

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.235
Ann!
Miss Darrow!

01:18:41.851 --> 01:18:42.909
Ann!

01:18:52.295 --> 01:18:53.353
Ann!

01:19:30.366 --> 01:19:32.766
Christ,
it's a bleeding boneyard!

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:36.638
They've been ripped
limb from limb.

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:40.908
Ann! Ann!

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:56.420
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:58.483
Jesus, Jimmy.
Hey, I need that!

01:19:58.561 --> 01:19:59.789
I'm not giving you a gun!

01:19:59.862 --> 01:20:01.887
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:05.525
I was in the Army.
I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:09.130
I wanna help bring her back.

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:18.947
Don't make me regret it.

01:20:46.272 --> 01:20:48.263
Conserve your ammunition!

01:20:57.617 --> 01:20:59.107
I'm knackered.

01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:03.480
I gotta have a breather.
Great idea.

01:21:03.556 --> 01:21:05.023
Fellows, we don't have
time for this.

01:21:05.091 --> 01:21:07.559
We've lost too much ground
already. Come on, get up!

01:21:07.627 --> 01:21:11.063
They're not about to
quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

01:21:11.197 --> 01:21:13.529
All right,
you got five minutes!

01:21:13.766 --> 01:21:15.700
Everybody stay in sight.

01:21:19.706 --> 01:21:23.142
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

01:21:53.373 --> 01:21:54.738
Bloody Nora!

01:22:01.881 --> 01:22:04.111
Is that
what took Miss Darrow?

01:22:07.687 --> 01:22:11.817
There's only one creature
capable of leaving
a footprint that size.

01:22:18.264 --> 01:22:20.164
The abominable snowman.

01:22:21.768 --> 01:22:24.464
Yeah, a snowman.
We dead meat.

01:22:25.171 --> 01:22:27.571
It's got to be what,
20, 25 feet?

01:22:29.676 --> 01:22:31.109
Carl saw it.

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:34.002
Let's ask him.

01:22:36.115 --> 01:22:37.309
Denham!

01:22:39.886 --> 01:22:41.148
Where'd he go?

01:23:01.374 --> 01:23:03.137
Walk forward, Bruce.

01:23:03.676 --> 01:23:05.473
What?
You're the star
of this picture.

01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:08.605
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

01:23:14.754 --> 01:23:17.348
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

01:23:27.567 --> 01:23:29.899
Are you sure about this,
Denham?

01:23:30.403 --> 01:23:32.462
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

01:23:32.538 --> 01:23:35.473
I need you in the shot,
or people will say
they're fake.

01:23:35.541 --> 01:23:37.736
Nobody's gonna think
these are fake.

01:23:46.419 --> 01:23:48.410
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

01:23:48.488 --> 01:23:49.785
I'm not moving.

01:23:55.561 --> 01:23:57.893
Mother of God.

01:24:19.852 --> 01:24:21.217
What's this?

01:24:47.446 --> 01:24:48.913
What is it? What is it?
Where's Carl?

01:24:48.981 --> 01:24:51.779
Carl?
He's up there, filming.

01:25:02.228 --> 01:25:03.627
Bugger this!

01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:05.727
Watch out.

01:25:11.037 --> 01:25:12.834
Run, Jack!

01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:18.166
Holy Christ.
Go, Jimmy, run!

01:25:19.078 --> 01:25:20.568
Run, run, run!

01:25:27.453 --> 01:25:29.045
Let go!
I'm not leaving the camera!

01:25:29.121 --> 01:25:30.418
Let go, you idiot!

01:25:30.489 --> 01:25:32.320
Carl, run!

01:25:45.771 --> 01:25:47.033
Look out!

01:25:47.874 --> 01:25:48.898
Look out!

01:26:39.225 --> 01:26:40.749
Coming through!

01:27:45.057 --> 01:27:46.081
No!

01:27:46.759 --> 01:27:48.021
Come on.

01:28:29.168 --> 01:28:31.898
Carl! Carl!

01:28:35.074 --> 01:28:37.599
Get up! Come on. Come on.

01:28:52.425 --> 01:28:55.087
Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham!

01:28:55.795 --> 01:28:58.389
Herb! Herb, come on!

01:28:58.464 --> 01:29:00.193
Take the tripod!

01:29:00.433 --> 01:29:01.661
Come on!

01:29:02.868 --> 01:29:05.428
I'm pulling you up!
Hold on to your end!

01:29:05.504 --> 01:29:06.528
Go!

01:29:06.605 --> 01:29:08.300
No, I'm not going anywhere
without you!

01:29:08.974 --> 01:29:11.636
You gotta leave me!
Shut up and hold on!

01:30:19.378 --> 01:30:21.107
Jimmy, do a head count.

01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:23.705
I want to know how many
are injured and how bad.

01:30:23.782 --> 01:30:25.044
Injured?

01:30:26.452 --> 01:30:28.215
Four of us are dead!

01:30:34.927 --> 01:30:36.690
It's not your fault.

01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:39.825
What happened to Herb
is no one's fault.

01:30:40.299 --> 01:30:42.699
You're absolutely right,
Preston.

01:30:43.102 --> 01:30:45.502
And I'll tell you
something else.

01:30:45.571 --> 01:30:47.869
Herbert didn't die
for nothing.

01:30:48.274 --> 01:30:51.072
He died for
what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honor that.

01:30:51.143 --> 01:30:55.204
He died believing
there was still some mystery
left in this world.

01:30:55.681 --> 01:30:58.275
And we could all
have a piece of it...

01:30:58.484 --> 01:31:01.009
for the price
of an admission ticket.

01:31:01.253 --> 01:31:04.950
God damn it, Preston,
we're gonna finish this film
for Herb.

01:31:05.357 --> 01:31:07.018
We'll finish it...

01:31:07.126 --> 01:31:10.027
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

01:31:17.303 --> 01:31:19.533
Come on, guys.
We need more rope.

01:31:21.473 --> 01:31:23.464
All right, we gotta
get back to the ship.

01:31:23.542 --> 01:31:27.239
Englehorn sails
in nine hours.
So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

01:31:27.313 --> 01:31:29.941
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be
stranded here.

01:31:31.784 --> 01:31:35.185
Miss Darrow was a great gal,
no question.

01:31:35.654 --> 01:31:37.383
And she was
a wonderful person.

01:31:37.456 --> 01:31:40.687
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

01:31:40.993 --> 01:31:44.895
I always knew you were
nothing like the tough guy
you play on screen.

01:31:44.964 --> 01:31:46.693
I just never figured you
for a coward.

01:31:46.765 --> 01:31:48.892
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

01:31:49.435 --> 01:31:51.903
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

01:31:51.971 --> 01:31:55.532
In the real world,
they got bad teeth,
a bald spot, and a beer gut.

01:31:55.608 --> 01:31:59.135
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

01:32:00.579 --> 01:32:02.069
Be seeing you.

01:32:03.315 --> 01:32:04.680
Anyone else?

01:32:06.218 --> 01:32:08.186
Well, see you.
Come on.

01:37:04.883 --> 01:37:06.077
No!

01:37:06.785 --> 01:37:08.218
I said no!

01:37:15.694 --> 01:37:19.255
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

01:39:41.673 --> 01:39:44.471
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

01:39:46.778 --> 01:39:48.302
Keep paddling.

01:40:25.217 --> 01:40:27.117
What the hell was that?

01:41:08.326 --> 01:41:10.692
Come on.
Get them out of there!

01:41:12.497 --> 01:41:13.828
Preston!

01:41:19.004 --> 01:41:20.631
Give me your hand.

01:41:21.139 --> 01:41:22.265
Jack!

01:41:27.712 --> 01:41:29.043
Jack!

01:41:33.785 --> 01:41:35.116
Choy!
Help!

01:41:35.287 --> 01:41:37.278
Swim, you filthy bugger.

01:42:46.391 --> 01:42:47.881
Choy!

01:42:49.794 --> 01:42:50.818
Stay with him.

01:42:50.896 --> 01:42:52.329
Swim to shore
as fast as you can!

01:42:52.397 --> 01:42:53.625
Hold on. Preston!

01:42:54.299 --> 01:42:56.426
Whatever happens,
don't let go of the camera!

01:42:56.501 --> 01:42:58.560
Don't let go
of the camera!

01:43:05.911 --> 01:43:08.175
Come on,
get up out of that water.

01:43:09.114 --> 01:43:10.342
Get up!

01:43:50.269 --> 01:43:51.759
Come on, come on.

01:44:04.016 --> 01:44:05.984
Preston. Preston.

01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:19.220
It's working.

01:44:37.183 --> 01:44:39.242
Did you get that, did you?

01:45:39.578 --> 01:45:40.943
No!

01:45:41.681 --> 01:45:42.705
No.

01:45:47.219 --> 01:45:48.243
No.

01:46:38.771 --> 01:46:39.897
What is it?

01:46:44.677 --> 01:46:45.974
Mr. Hayes?

01:46:49.548 --> 01:46:52.142
If anything happens,
I want you to run.

01:46:52.651 --> 01:46:53.913
You understand?

01:46:54.487 --> 01:46:57.456
I'm not a coward.
I ain't gonna run.

01:46:58.991 --> 01:47:00.959
It's not about
being brave, Jimmy.

01:47:29.588 --> 01:47:30.612
Go back!

01:47:32.658 --> 01:47:34.057
Back across the log!

01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:36.820
I ain't gonna run!
Get Jimmy out of here!

01:47:37.063 --> 01:47:38.360
No!
Get back! Get back!

01:47:43.269 --> 01:47:44.600
Move back!

01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:59.814
No! No!
Stay back.

01:48:02.521 --> 01:48:03.579
No!

01:48:08.861 --> 01:48:10.158
Look at me.

01:48:12.398 --> 01:48:14.958
Let him go!
You got to run, Jimmy.

01:48:19.138 --> 01:48:20.503
Do as I say.

01:48:21.841 --> 01:48:23.240
Go with Jack.

01:48:25.678 --> 01:48:26.736
Run!

01:48:30.282 --> 01:48:32.716
No!
Shoot him!

01:48:34.253 --> 01:48:35.242
No!

01:48:50.302 --> 01:48:53.100
Here! Over here!

01:49:11.223 --> 01:49:13.191
Hold on! Hold on!

01:49:17.296 --> 01:49:19.560
Lumpy! Help me!

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:23.199
Bloody hell, Choy!

01:54:44.857 --> 01:54:45.915
No!

01:54:50.095 --> 01:54:51.289
Oh, my!

02:01:26.758 --> 02:01:28.055
Wait!

02:02:17.575 --> 02:02:18.701
Carl.

02:02:23.782 --> 02:02:25.374
Jimmy. Jimmy.

02:02:26.251 --> 02:02:27.240
Jimmy.

02:02:28.353 --> 02:02:29.513
You all right?

02:03:19.471 --> 02:03:20.733
No.

02:04:13.224 --> 02:04:15.249
Get off! Get it off!

02:04:22.567 --> 02:04:23.591
Get off!

02:04:37.482 --> 02:04:38.574
Get it off!

02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:40.144
Get it off! Get it off!

02:05:44.516 --> 02:05:45.642
Kill it!

02:05:57.729 --> 02:05:59.128
Stop moving!

02:06:19.184 --> 02:06:20.913
Get it off my face!

02:06:21.886 --> 02:06:24.286
Stay still.
I am standing still.

02:06:26.791 --> 02:06:28.588
Hold on.
Be careful!

02:07:03.428 --> 02:07:06.056
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

02:07:06.731 --> 02:07:08.255
Coming through!

02:07:16.708 --> 02:07:19.302
Get out of there now! Climb!

02:07:26.384 --> 02:07:28.181
Nobody get in my way.

02:07:31.289 --> 02:07:33.086
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

02:07:33.157 --> 02:07:35.648
Get up the rope.
Let's go. Hurry up.

02:08:02.153 --> 02:08:04.417
Jimmy, let's go.

02:08:08.693 --> 02:08:10.320
Come on.
Okay.

02:08:13.965 --> 02:08:14.954
Go.

02:08:19.671 --> 02:08:21.901
Just as you go down...

02:08:22.607 --> 02:08:25.075
for the third
and final time...

02:08:26.010 --> 02:08:28.911
as your head disappears
beneath the waves...

02:08:29.547 --> 02:08:31.777
and your lungs fill
with water...

02:08:32.383 --> 02:08:36.581
do you know what happens
in those last precious seconds
before you drown?

02:08:36.754 --> 02:08:39.621
Come on, buddy.
Get up the rope. Come on.
Get out of here. Come on.

02:08:39.691 --> 02:08:42.387
Your whole life passes
before your eyes.

02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:44.928
And if you've lived
as a true American...

02:08:45.196 --> 02:08:47.596
you get to watch it all
in color.

02:08:48.433 --> 02:08:50.025
Oh, and you will.

02:08:50.101 --> 02:08:52.626
Now, why don't you climb
up the rope, huh? Come on.

02:08:58.109 --> 02:09:00.236
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

02:11:54.919 --> 02:11:56.443
It's beautiful.

02:12:17.909 --> 02:12:19.240
Beautiful.

02:12:30.721 --> 02:12:32.052
Beautiful.

02:13:19.470 --> 02:13:20.664
There.

02:13:23.741 --> 02:13:24.833
Thank God.

02:13:24.909 --> 02:13:26.877
Don't thank God.
Thank Mr. Baxter.

02:13:26.978 --> 02:13:28.946
He insisted on
a rescue mission.

02:13:30.281 --> 02:13:33.739
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

02:13:35.052 --> 02:13:37.316
That's the thing
about cockroaches.

02:13:37.388 --> 02:13:40.824
No matter how many times
you flush them
down the toilet...

02:13:40.891 --> 02:13:43.382
they always crawl
back up the bowl.

02:13:44.328 --> 02:13:47.161
Hey, buddy?
I'm out of the bowl.

02:13:47.932 --> 02:13:50.594
I'm dryin' off my wings
and trekkin' across the lid.

02:13:58.542 --> 02:13:59.770
Driscoll!

02:14:01.245 --> 02:14:04.908
Don't be a fool!
Give it up. It's useless!

02:14:06.183 --> 02:14:07.548
She's dead.

02:14:10.354 --> 02:14:11.912
She's not dead.

02:14:15.826 --> 02:14:18.056
Jack's gonna bring her back...

02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:21.624
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.

02:14:22.333 --> 02:14:24.858
We can still
come out of this thing okay.

02:14:27.471 --> 02:14:29.029
More than okay.

02:14:30.274 --> 02:14:31.832
Think about it.

02:14:31.909 --> 02:14:34.742
You got a boat
full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:37.580
You wanna trap the ape?

02:14:44.422 --> 02:14:46.049
I don't think so.

02:14:46.624 --> 02:14:50.060
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?

02:14:51.562 --> 02:14:53.325
I heard you were the best.

02:15:01.439 --> 02:15:02.565
Jack!

02:15:05.643 --> 02:15:07.406
Look after yourself!

02:15:08.045 --> 02:15:09.672
Keep the gate open, will you?

02:15:10.047 --> 02:15:11.446
Sure thing, buddy.

02:15:12.483 --> 02:15:13.814
Good luck!

02:15:27.098 --> 02:15:28.463
I'm sorry.

02:18:07.324 --> 02:18:08.382
Ann.

02:19:16.927 --> 02:19:18.019
Jack!

02:19:18.896 --> 02:19:19.987
Run!

02:19:50.294 --> 02:19:51.921
Jack, Jack!

02:19:59.636 --> 02:20:00.796
Jack.

02:20:09.847 --> 02:20:11.815
Ann, it's okay.

02:20:12.649 --> 02:20:15.049
Ann, let's go.
Let's go. Come on!

02:20:28.332 --> 02:20:29.697
Let's go. Come on.

02:20:30.434 --> 02:20:31.662
Come on!

02:22:03.927 --> 02:22:05.019
Carl!

02:22:05.195 --> 02:22:07.891
Please! Somebody help us!

02:22:10.033 --> 02:22:11.500
They've gone.

02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:15.129
Carl. Christ.

02:22:15.706 --> 02:22:16.798
Carl!

02:22:17.641 --> 02:22:19.802
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

02:22:19.877 --> 02:22:21.105
Not yet.

02:22:22.546 --> 02:22:23.638
Wait.

02:22:24.314 --> 02:22:25.406
Wait.

02:22:29.553 --> 02:22:30.645
Wait!

02:22:41.365 --> 02:22:42.593
Come on!

02:23:55.072 --> 02:23:56.562
Now!
Throw them!

02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:58.039
Throw!

02:23:58.909 --> 02:23:59.933
No!

02:24:02.312 --> 02:24:03.540
Hold him!

02:24:03.614 --> 02:24:05.104
Are you out of your mind?

02:24:13.824 --> 02:24:15.951
Stop!
Hold the line!

02:24:16.693 --> 02:24:18.092
Keep him down!

02:24:23.667 --> 02:24:24.656
Heave!

02:24:25.702 --> 02:24:27.033
Please!

02:24:27.504 --> 02:24:29.199
No! Stop!

02:24:29.539 --> 02:24:30.528
Jack.

02:24:31.608 --> 02:24:32.870
No.
Get her out of...

02:24:32.943 --> 02:24:34.843
They'll kill him!
There's nothing we can do.

02:24:34.911 --> 02:24:36.879
No!
Get her out of his sight!

02:24:36.947 --> 02:24:38.881
It's too late.
Throw it!

02:24:41.151 --> 02:24:42.243
Look out!

02:24:44.554 --> 02:24:46.021
Let go of me.

02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:51.787
We gotta go. Come on.

02:24:52.362 --> 02:24:53.556
Come on.
Stop it.

02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:55.154
Leave me alone!

02:24:56.333 --> 02:24:57.857
Ann, please come on.

02:25:05.175 --> 02:25:07.006
Kill it!
No. No!

02:25:07.210 --> 02:25:09.474
It's over,
you goddamn lunatic!

02:25:11.682 --> 02:25:13.206
All of you, run!

02:25:13.283 --> 02:25:14.944
Come on. Come on!

02:25:31.702 --> 02:25:32.999
Look out!

02:25:44.281 --> 02:25:45.908
Move it! Move it!

02:25:48.285 --> 02:25:49.650
Come on, come on!

02:25:58.562 --> 02:26:00.189
Stay there!
It's me he wants!

02:26:00.263 --> 02:26:02.458
Please stop this!
Move! Hold onto her!

02:26:02.532 --> 02:26:05.194
Ann, go.
Please, I can stop this!

02:26:05.268 --> 02:26:06.792
No!
Ann, stay there!

02:26:09.272 --> 02:26:10.671
Get it out!

02:26:13.410 --> 02:26:15.275
Get the hell out of here!

02:26:15.345 --> 02:26:17.336
Come on!
Jimmy, don't be crazy!
Come on.

02:26:17.414 --> 02:26:18.711
Don't be crazy.

02:26:19.916 --> 02:26:21.008
Let me go!

02:26:22.352 --> 02:26:23.819
Cast off!

02:26:26.123 --> 02:26:27.385
Come on, Carl!

02:26:28.859 --> 02:26:30.690
Row!
Wait.

02:26:30.961 --> 02:26:33.088
Row, God damn it!

02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:44.466
Go back.

02:26:51.381 --> 02:26:52.507
Jimmy, no!

02:26:59.489 --> 02:27:00.478
No!

02:27:17.574 --> 02:27:19.405
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

02:27:19.476 --> 02:27:21.000
Hide out in the back!

02:27:43.567 --> 02:27:45.194
Wait!
No!

02:27:45.902 --> 02:27:48.496
No! No! Please don't!

02:29:46.723 --> 02:29:49.248
The whole world
will pay to see this.

02:29:51.995 --> 02:29:53.986
We're millionaires, boys!

02:29:54.297 --> 02:29:56.197
I'll share it with all of you!

02:29:57.033 --> 02:30:01.527
In a few months
his name will be up
in lights on Broadway!

02:30:03.707 --> 02:30:07.803
Kong!
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!

02:31:08.271 --> 02:31:09.397
Mr. Denham!

02:31:11.107 --> 02:31:13.132
What can I say?
What can I say?

02:31:13.209 --> 02:31:14.608
Any comments, Mr. Denham?

02:31:15.945 --> 02:31:17.572
The Mayor, thank you.

02:31:18.782 --> 02:31:19.771
Ready.

02:31:19.949 --> 02:31:21.280
What am I?

02:31:21.685 --> 02:31:23.414
Thank you very much.

02:31:27.257 --> 02:31:28.747
Get used to it.

02:31:28.958 --> 02:31:32.155
Listen, it's great to see you.
Ready?
I'm really
appreciating that...

02:31:32.228 --> 02:31:33.695
Look at you!
I remember you.

02:31:33.763 --> 02:31:36.755
You're a lucky guy, Denham.
Am I a lucky guy?

02:31:36.833 --> 02:31:38.630
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

02:31:52.449 --> 02:31:53.609
Carl!

02:31:55.485 --> 02:31:56.679
Zelman!
I told them.

02:31:56.753 --> 02:31:58.220
I know you did
and I appreciate it.

02:31:58.288 --> 02:32:00.279
Let's get a shot of this.

02:32:00.757 --> 02:32:01.883
Come on.

02:32:02.625 --> 02:32:04.957
Big smile.
Yeah! That's great!

02:32:07.330 --> 02:32:10.265
<i>Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.</i>

02:32:11.267 --> 02:32:13.531
No woman is worth this.
This woman is worth it.

02:32:13.603 --> 02:32:15.594
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

02:32:15.672 --> 02:32:16.900
Oh, really?

02:32:16.973 --> 02:32:18.634
She's not gonna buy this
for a second.

02:32:18.708 --> 02:32:20.903
Shut up and hand me
the grapefruit!

02:32:23.046 --> 02:32:25.708
<i>You're writing a comedy?
Yes, I am.</i>

02:32:26.449 --> 02:32:28.383
<i>I'm writing it for you.</i>

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:32.185
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

02:32:33.189 --> 02:32:35.589
<i>Why would I write
a play for you?</i>

02:32:38.995 --> 02:32:40.622
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

02:32:40.897 --> 02:32:42.387
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:32:43.633 --> 02:32:45.498
I couldn't help but overhear.

02:32:49.005 --> 02:32:51.735
So, he took me to this
fancy French restaurant...

02:32:51.808 --> 02:32:54.606
and halfway through
the hors d'oeuvres,
he clutches my hand.

02:32:54.677 --> 02:32:56.872
And that's when he told you
how he felt?

02:32:56.946 --> 02:32:59.676
No. He never said it.
He never said it?

02:32:59.749 --> 02:33:01.717
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

02:33:01.785 --> 02:33:03.810
Well, then how does she know
that it's real?

02:33:03.887 --> 02:33:07.345
He said it was
not about the words.
Oh, please!

02:33:07.557 --> 02:33:11.687
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

02:33:12.061 --> 02:33:16.361
He said we'd talk
about it later.
Only there was no later.

02:33:18.101 --> 02:33:19.659
It never happened.

02:33:20.670 --> 02:33:22.433
That's how it ended.

02:33:22.572 --> 02:33:26.303
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

02:33:28.178 --> 02:33:31.545
I honestly believed
things might actually
work out...

02:33:32.649 --> 02:33:34.640
which was really very...

02:33:37.921 --> 02:33:39.149
foolish.

02:33:39.389 --> 02:33:42.017
Men.
Oh, they'll give you
the world...

02:33:42.091 --> 02:33:44.491
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

02:33:44.561 --> 02:33:46.461
slip through their fingers.

02:33:46.529 --> 02:33:47.757
Typical.

02:33:48.364 --> 02:33:52.027
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use
their brains.

02:33:53.002 --> 02:33:54.902
Romance. Who needs it?

02:34:19.629 --> 02:34:20.960
Thank you.

02:34:21.798 --> 02:34:23.163
Thank you.

02:34:26.102 --> 02:34:27.433
Thank you.

02:34:29.239 --> 02:34:30.604
Thank you.

02:34:32.408 --> 02:34:33.875
Ladies and gentlemen...

02:34:35.478 --> 02:34:37.969
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.

02:34:38.748 --> 02:34:40.477
The story of our adventure...

02:34:41.317 --> 02:34:44.286
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

02:34:45.255 --> 02:34:46.745
their lives lost...

02:34:47.523 --> 02:34:49.616
in pursuit of
a savage beast...

02:34:50.793 --> 02:34:53.387
a monstrous aberration
of nature.

02:34:54.631 --> 02:34:56.758
But even the meanest brute
can be tamed.

02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:59.798
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see...

02:35:00.270 --> 02:35:01.931
the beast was no match...

02:35:02.538 --> 02:35:04.096
for the charms of a girl.

02:35:07.577 --> 02:35:09.169
A girl from New York...

02:35:12.382 --> 02:35:14.179
who melted his heart...

02:35:14.884 --> 02:35:17.478
bringing to mind
that old Arabian proverb...

02:35:19.422 --> 02:35:22.585
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty...

02:35:23.626 --> 02:35:25.526
"and beauty stayed his hand.

02:35:26.829 --> 02:35:30.697
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

02:35:38.474 --> 02:35:41.932
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

02:35:42.078 --> 02:35:45.070
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

02:35:46.215 --> 02:35:50.879
He was a king in the world
he knew, but he comes to you
now a captive.

02:35:52.088 --> 02:35:53.749
Ladies and gentlemen...

02:35:53.823 --> 02:35:58.351
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!

02:36:07.737 --> 02:36:10.865
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.

02:36:11.174 --> 02:36:14.610
These chains are made
of chrome steel!

02:36:35.365 --> 02:36:37.162
Observe, if you will...

02:36:40.436 --> 02:36:42.404
I am touching the beast.

02:36:42.705 --> 02:36:46.937
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

02:36:54.083 --> 02:36:55.710
Crank 'em up, fellas.

02:37:15.038 --> 02:37:17.233
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

02:37:17.306 --> 02:37:18.933
a surprise guest.

02:37:19.742 --> 02:37:21.937
The real-life hero
of this story.

02:37:22.345 --> 02:37:24.779
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

02:37:26.449 --> 02:37:31.216
The man who risked all
to win the freedom
of a helpless female.

02:37:32.388 --> 02:37:34.720
A big hand for
Mr. Bruce Baxter!

02:37:40.596 --> 02:37:42.655
Thank you. Thank you.

02:37:43.332 --> 02:37:44.492
Thank you.

02:38:12.195 --> 02:38:13.628
He was right.

02:38:15.198 --> 02:38:17.996
About there still being some
mystery left in this world...

02:38:19.168 --> 02:38:21.466
and we can all have
a piece of it...

02:38:21.838 --> 02:38:24.102
for the price
of an admission ticket.

02:38:25.675 --> 02:38:27.973
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

02:38:30.079 --> 02:38:33.480
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things
he loves.

02:38:47.930 --> 02:38:50.524
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen...

02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:53.899
for we now come
to the climax of
this savage ritual.

02:38:54.103 --> 02:38:56.594
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.

02:38:57.373 --> 02:39:01.002
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

02:39:02.245 --> 02:39:06.306
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl
I've ever met!

02:39:07.049 --> 02:39:08.311
Miss Ann Darrow.

02:39:56.299 --> 02:39:58.028
Save me from the beast!

02:40:06.909 --> 02:40:08.137
Help me!

02:40:12.281 --> 02:40:13.578
Where is she?

02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:16.308
Where's Ann?
I have no idea.

02:40:16.385 --> 02:40:19.786
I heard he offered her
all kinds of money
and she turned him down flat.

02:41:05.601 --> 02:41:06.932
Here's your story, boys.

02:41:07.003 --> 02:41:10.097
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

02:41:15.845 --> 02:41:16.834
No.

02:41:25.187 --> 02:41:27.052
We have to get these people
out of here.

02:41:27.123 --> 02:41:29.114
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.

02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:33.055
Let him roar.
It makes a swell picture.

02:41:34.897 --> 02:41:35.921
Head for the exits.

02:41:35.998 --> 02:41:38.432
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

02:41:46.609 --> 02:41:47.837
Excuse me, fellows.

02:41:48.778 --> 02:41:51.474
Coming through.
Coming through, fellows.

02:41:55.051 --> 02:41:58.043
Get me down! Help me, please!

02:42:00.456 --> 02:42:03.357
Somebody! Somebody help me!

02:42:06.762 --> 02:42:09.424
Go! Go! Get out!

02:42:13.402 --> 02:42:14.892
Go! Go!

02:43:49.899 --> 02:43:52.333
There they are.
Come on, come with me.

02:44:05.147 --> 02:44:06.808
Go!
Wait for me!

02:44:07.716 --> 02:44:09.081
Go back!

02:44:16.091 --> 02:44:17.353
This way!

02:44:25.134 --> 02:44:26.294
Help!

02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:35.699
No!

02:45:15.618 --> 02:45:18.280
Taxi! Follow that ape.

02:45:18.354 --> 02:45:19.844
Come on, pal,
we gotta draw him off.

02:45:19.922 --> 02:45:21.753
It's all yours, buddy.

02:45:38.173 --> 02:45:39.902
Better get out of here, lady!

02:46:00.629 --> 02:46:01.857
Come on.

02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:12.029
Buddy!

02:46:13.375 --> 02:46:15.605
Come on. Come on.

02:46:34.396 --> 02:46:35.385
Look out.

02:46:58.053 --> 02:46:59.281
Jesus Christ.

02:52:22.844 --> 02:52:23.105
Fire!

02:52:26.348 --> 02:52:27.440
Stop!

02:52:42.798 --> 02:52:44.129
Listen up.

02:52:44.199 --> 02:52:47.396
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

02:52:47.469 --> 02:52:48.868
You hear me?

02:52:49.371 --> 02:52:52.067
It was built for humans,
by humans.

02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:54.768
Not for stinking
lice-infested apes.

02:52:54.843 --> 02:52:56.674
<i>The thought
of some mutant gorilla...</i>

02:52:56.745 --> 02:53:01.079
<i>crapping all over the streets
of this fair city,
fills me with disgust.</i>

02:53:01.350 --> 02:53:03.318
<i>So this is how it's gonna be.</i>

02:53:03.385 --> 02:53:05.717
We find it. We kill it.

02:53:06.054 --> 02:53:10.218
We cut its ugly head off
and we ram it up...

02:53:29.378 --> 02:53:30.936
No. No.

02:56:02.497 --> 02:56:03.828
Beautiful.

02:56:10.272 --> 02:56:11.330
Yes.

02:56:13.975 --> 02:56:15.340
Yes, it is.

03:01:08.736 --> 03:01:09.998
Look at that.

03:01:11.940 --> 03:01:13.066
Hey! Hey!

03:01:13.341 --> 03:01:14.968
Nobody past this point.

03:01:16.211 --> 03:01:17.838
You can't go in there!

03:01:19.180 --> 03:01:20.169
Hey!

03:01:22.283 --> 03:01:23.580
Stop him!

03:01:26.688 --> 03:01:28.952
Hey! Get back.
You're not allowed up there!

03:01:29.023 --> 03:01:30.684
What's going on?
Go!

03:05:12.580 --> 03:05:13.877
No!

03:05:15.049 --> 03:05:17.210
No!

03:05:24.192 --> 03:05:26.820
Please! No!

03:05:27.195 --> 03:05:28.389
No!

03:08:25.006 --> 03:08:27.304
Ann. Ann.

03:09:16.624 --> 03:09:17.921
Move along.

03:09:18.392 --> 03:09:20.292
Just one shot! One shot!

03:09:20.962 --> 03:09:23.055
Come, come!
Boys, how about a photo?

03:09:23.130 --> 03:09:24.119
Look at me.

03:09:24.231 --> 03:09:25.960
Come on, watch the camera.

03:09:28.803 --> 03:09:30.327
Come a little closer.

03:09:31.005 --> 03:09:33.200
That's it, folks.
Show's over. Step back!

03:09:33.274 --> 03:09:35.469
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.

03:09:36.177 --> 03:09:37.735
Why'd he do that?

03:09:38.045 --> 03:09:40.513
Climb up there
and get himself cornered.

03:09:40.581 --> 03:09:42.913
The ape must have known
what was coming.

03:09:42.984 --> 03:09:45.646
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

03:09:51.859 --> 03:09:54.589
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.

03:09:57.164 --> 03:09:59.132
It wasn't the airplanes.

03:10:03.504 --> 03:10:05.802
It was beauty
killed the beast.
