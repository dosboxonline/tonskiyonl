08:45.941 --> 08:46.400
You were late.

08:47.941 --> 08:50.358
Next time you break out
of prison and I fly this thing.

08:51.066 --> 08:51.608
No, thanks.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.566
So how'd it go?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.691
How it always goes.

08:57.025 --> 09:00.483
Good for me, bad for him.

10:05.275 --> 10:15.358
Kravanov and Kravanov, your
father is coming to pick you up.

10:22.566 --> 10:22.983
What'd you do?

10:24.566 --> 10:24.775
Me.

10:26.191 --> 10:27.025
Nothing, I thought it was you.

10:27.441 --> 10:27.691
No.

10:47.275 --> 10:52.316
Where are we going, Papa?

10:53.608 --> 10:55.066
We're in the middle of a term at school.

10:55.525 --> 10:55.733
Sergei.

10:55.858 --> 10:57.525
Mom never made us do shit like this.

10:57.900 --> 11:02.358
Sergei, your mother is dead.

11:04.358 --> 11:05.316
She took all life.

11:05.566 --> 11:09.566
She was weak, sick in her mind.

11:14.566 --> 11:15.525
Was her choice.

11:17.650 --> 11:19.191
Well, she died because you sent her away.

11:19.566 --> 11:19.900
No.

11:21.025 --> 11:23.066
She gave up long ago.

11:25.150 --> 11:26.816
You haven't even seen her for two years.

11:28.483 --> 11:31.858
Nothing will change
for you, or for you, Dmitry.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.566
Where are we going, Papa? To the funeral?

11:35.608 --> 11:38.316
If you take on life, you
do not get the honor of funeral.

11:39.191 --> 11:40.358
So then where are you taking us?

11:40.733 --> 11:41.483
We go to hunt.

11:42.941 --> 11:44.525
There'll be no sightings of lions.

11:45.275 --> 11:48.566
It will be good for you.

11:49.025 --> 11:49.275
Both.

11:50.608 --> 11:55.441
The joined men, be one
with nature, should to kill.

11:57.566 --> 11:57.900
Fan.

12:16.566 --> 12:17.316
Careful with those.

12:18.691 --> 12:20.608
Put the cards away now, Calypso.

12:21.150 --> 12:22.941
Your mom and dad will be back soon.

12:23.608 --> 12:25.691
And you know the way
they feel about all this.

12:26.566 --> 12:27.733
It's just a game, Grammy.

12:28.566 --> 12:30.941
You think my cards
are just pretty pictures?

12:32.816 --> 12:33.566
Think again, Calypso.

12:35.566 --> 12:38.150
They show us the unseen road.

12:39.733 --> 12:42.316
What? Like predict the future?

12:42.566 --> 12:45.150
Mm-hmm. In the right hands.

12:50.691 --> 12:52.316
Lay three cards down.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.983
The first card is the subject.

12:57.025 --> 12:58.066
The high priestess?

12:59.441 --> 13:02.566
You do come from a long
line of very powerful women.

13:03.566 --> 13:05.608
The second card is the situation.

13:07.483 --> 13:08.025
The tower.

13:09.150 --> 13:11.358
There's going to be a terrible accident.

13:13.608 --> 13:16.483
The third card is the outcome.

13:17.733 --> 13:17.941
Strength.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.525
There is great danger in that card.

13:22.650 --> 13:24.566
I have something for you, Calypso.

13:25.275 --> 13:27.400
I was going to wait until you were older.

13:27.691 --> 13:30.566
But the cards have shown
us you will need it very soon.

13:30.566 --> 13:32.275
What is it?

13:33.233 --> 13:33.775
A potion.

13:34.691 --> 13:38.650
The formula has been passed
down in our family for generations.

13:40.566 --> 13:42.191
What does that symbol mean?

13:42.900 --> 13:45.650
It's a sign of the spirit, papa ligpa.

13:46.650 --> 13:49.025
He opens the gate to the other side.

13:49.941 --> 13:50.900
Protect it.

13:52.108 --> 13:53.400
Very powerful.

13:55.858 --> 13:56.316
Go ahead.

13:57.316 --> 14:01.358
It will heal whoever
drinks it in undreamed-of ways.

14:02.525 --> 14:04.316
The time is coming soon.

14:05.441 --> 14:07.275
You'll know what to do with it.

14:08.525 --> 14:10.566
Now put those away
before your parents get back.

14:29.275 --> 14:30.566
Well done, Nikolai.

14:40.400 --> 14:40.608
Sergei.

14:47.566 --> 14:50.941
You see, it's so beautiful.

14:54.691 --> 14:55.566
Never fear death.

14:57.358 --> 14:58.025
They are prey.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.566
We are predators.

15:07.566 --> 15:12.275
Men should be only
animal that is dreaded.

15:18.150 --> 15:18.858
The matry.

15:20.025 --> 15:20.858
Don't look so weak.

15:23.233 --> 15:23.566
Be a man.

15:27.566 --> 15:29.108
You all right?

15:30.358 --> 15:30.733
Yeah.

15:32.941 --> 15:34.400
You shouldn't have
talked to you like that.

15:36.066 --> 15:36.358
Yeah, well...

15:38.566 --> 15:39.150
He's an asshole.

15:40.691 --> 15:41.858
There's nothing I can do about that.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.150
He'll never respect
me like he respects you.

15:46.900 --> 15:47.316
Wanna bet?

15:56.608 --> 15:58.025
I miss Ma.

16:00.150 --> 16:00.816
Me too, Dima.

16:01.566 --> 16:02.525
Me too.

16:09.691 --> 16:10.400
Is it the Zarr?

16:10.858 --> 16:12.108
Not even Pussycat.

16:12.650 --> 16:14.900
Perhaps it's the
Zarr's illegitimate half-brother.

16:16.775 --> 16:17.441
Like your Demetri.

16:17.775 --> 16:18.483
Leave the boy.

16:19.650 --> 16:22.733
He carries no blame
for his father's wandering.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.566
You will know Zarr when you're here.

16:27.150 --> 16:30.566
He sounds like thunder from mountaintop.

16:30.691 --> 16:32.358
You have seen this beast?

16:33.566 --> 16:35.066
I have seen his work.

16:36.691 --> 16:41.816
This cat has killed two
thousand, maybe three dozen men. Yes?

16:42.900 --> 16:46.816
For as long as men like you
have been coming down here to kill lions,

16:48.025 --> 16:50.525
there have been legends
of the one who can't be killed.

16:51.191 --> 16:52.150
Men like me.

16:53.566 --> 16:55.566
But you still take
my money, don't you, Baha'i?

16:57.733 --> 16:59.608
A lion hunts for food.

17:01.191 --> 17:02.066
Same as I do.

17:07.733 --> 17:08.941
Why do you hunt Nikolai?

17:10.316 --> 17:11.525
You know this, Baha'i.

17:13.358 --> 17:16.733
Men who kill legend, becomes legend.

17:22.441 --> 17:22.983
Nikolai.

17:23.900 --> 17:24.566
We should talk.

17:24.566 --> 17:26.025
Save your pet.

17:27.608 --> 17:28.358
No, it's a condition.

17:28.775 --> 17:32.400
I'll be okay, as long as I
take a few breaks here and there.

17:32.941 --> 17:36.233
One thing that you should know about
me is that I'm always thinking of the future.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.108
I want you to be my partner.

17:43.316 --> 17:43.941
What is your name?

17:46.900 --> 17:49.066
I'm my guest here on Vladimir.

17:51.233 --> 17:52.400
Alexey Sitzivich.

17:52.691 --> 17:52.900
No.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.066
You do not care of name.

17:59.066 --> 18:01.858
In this world, you barely exist.

18:02.441 --> 18:04.608
So what can some non-name, non-existent,

18:04.608 --> 18:07.775
conditioned, suffering
fool offer up to the Kravinovs?

18:09.608 --> 18:09.900
Nothing.

18:12.316 --> 18:13.066
I am here,

18:14.733 --> 18:16.775
teaching my sons the joy of stalking.

18:18.358 --> 18:22.566
And you and your
imbecilic voice are stalking me.

18:24.608 --> 18:25.400
So be quiet.

18:29.608 --> 18:36.441
Well, father gets him this time.

18:37.900 --> 18:38.275
Why?

18:39.233 --> 18:42.066
Well, because then he'll become a
legend and we don't have to come here again.

18:45.566 --> 18:47.483
A true legend would fight fair.

18:48.650 --> 18:49.233
Not with a gun.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.191
You do it one on one with
only the tools you're born with.

18:59.066 --> 19:01.650
(growling)

19:01.650 --> 19:04.566
Dmitry, get back.

19:25.525 --> 19:35.316
(growling)

19:40.566 --> 19:41.941
Dmitry, move!

19:43.108 --> 19:43.316
Move!

19:47.233 --> 19:48.066
Run!

19:55.483 --> 19:59.483
(screaming)

20:02.566 --> 20:03.275
Sergei!

20:04.108 --> 20:04.483
Sergei!

20:06.566 --> 20:07.066
Sergei!

20:24.608 --> 20:26.316
(screaming)

20:29.900 --> 20:30.566
Calypso, look!

20:42.400 --> 20:47.775
Come on, honey, stand up.

20:52.233 --> 20:52.566
Calypso?

20:55.566 --> 20:55.858
Calypso!

20:59.566 --> 20:59.691
Calypso!

21:24.566 --> 21:26.566
(growling)

21:54.608 --> 21:58.900
In the name of all the
spirits and all the mysteries...

21:59.733 --> 21:59.900
Mysteries...

22:03.566 --> 22:03.983
Help!

22:09.733 --> 22:12.066
Bring the power of the earth.

22:13.150 --> 22:14.566
The power of the earth.

22:14.566 --> 22:22.025
(rumbling)

22:23.566 --> 22:24.483
Wait!

22:35.566 --> 22:37.566
Bring the power of the sky.

22:46.608 --> 22:48.275
Everybody's clear. Shocking now.

22:54.275 --> 22:55.816
Okay, team, we've done all we can.

22:56.775 --> 22:59.566
I'm going to call Time of Death, 651.

23:14.608 --> 23:18.191
(growling)

23:32.566 --> 23:35.858
The EMTs found that card in your pocket.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.816
You are one very lucky boy.

23:40.150 --> 23:41.066
Thank you for saving me.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.566
I wish I could say I did.

23:44.608 --> 23:45.900
But I didn't save him.

23:47.733 --> 23:48.566
I don't understand.

23:49.608 --> 23:50.775
That makes the two of us.

23:51.483 --> 23:55.233
But we're going to run some tests,
see if we can figure out what happened.

23:56.275 --> 23:56.483
Sergei.

23:57.983 --> 23:58.358
Dima.

24:05.608 --> 24:06.441
Why did you not shoot?

24:09.025 --> 24:11.566
You must be Sergei's father, Mr. Kravinov.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.775
I am here to take him home.

24:15.358 --> 24:16.941
He needs to stay here and recover.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.316
Clinically, he was dead
for more than three minutes.

24:21.233 --> 24:23.150
He will be leaving with me.

24:37.566 --> 24:38.566
Sergei.

24:59.991 --> 25:01.525
Sergei, come down here.

25:01.608 --> 25:11.108
Father is the only
animal that is dreaded.

25:12.566 --> 25:13.733
You're getting too good at that.

25:14.358 --> 25:14.900
He'll be all right.

25:16.108 --> 25:17.650
You almost got your brother killed.

25:20.108 --> 25:21.608
You almost got yourself killed.

25:22.233 --> 25:23.566
Because you were afraid.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.483
Fear will eat you.

25:28.316 --> 25:29.566
It makes you weak.

25:29.566 --> 25:29.816
I am not a child of any kind.
I am not a child of any kind. Weak?

25:31.650 --> 25:32.900
Are you weak like your mother?

25:33.691 --> 25:33.900
Crazy?

25:34.900 --> 25:36.025
Or are you like me?

25:37.108 --> 25:40.066
Because if you show weakness to enemies,

25:40.441 --> 25:42.900
it gives them an opening.

25:44.233 --> 25:46.775
You are old enough to understand.

25:48.441 --> 25:51.233
You're not my business, yes?

25:52.816 --> 25:55.650
One day, you will be in charge.

25:56.900 --> 25:57.900
Dimitri, go!

25:59.608 --> 26:01.983
Dimitri, welcome
back to school in New York.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.691
And you will stay here with me.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.650
I think America is making you soft.

26:10.608 --> 26:11.691
Just for your own good.

26:13.483 --> 26:15.358
Each of us have a path to walk.

26:18.108 --> 26:19.608
Embrace who you really are,

26:20.775 --> 26:22.525
and you will have
the strength to walk it.

26:25.733 --> 26:26.150
Come.

26:28.275 --> 26:28.566
Come here.

26:29.566 --> 26:34.733
I got you something.

26:42.150 --> 26:43.900
You never have to be afraid again.

26:46.525 --> 26:53.483
He should have killed you!

26:56.316 --> 27:01.108
What is going on with you?

27:05.441 --> 27:06.566
Sergei, get back here.

27:06.566 --> 27:54.566
Are you okay?

28:06.750 --> 28:07.666
[gunshot]

28:16.166 --> 28:22.416
Don't leave me with him.

[gasps]

28:53.483 --> 28:53.900
I'm going.

28:55.316 --> 28:55.816
I have to.

28:56.233 --> 28:56.400
Why?

28:56.858 --> 28:57.900
I can't explain it.

28:58.275 --> 28:59.400
Something's happened to me.

29:00.191 --> 29:01.066
What are you talking about?

29:01.441 --> 29:03.108
Do you remember
the place we used to camp?

29:04.441 --> 29:06.441
Where all you could hear
were the crickets and the owls.

29:07.650 --> 29:09.400
And Mom used to
sing to us around the fire.

29:10.358 --> 29:12.108
That land is all I have left of her.

29:12.483 --> 29:13.525
Why does that make it okay?

29:15.233 --> 29:16.025
Picture me there.

29:20.483 --> 29:20.566
I'm sorry, Dima.

29:22.858 --> 29:23.316
I am.

29:27.566 --> 29:28.691
Just go, if we're gonna go.

29:31.733 --> 29:32.233
Go.

29:34.775 --> 29:37.816
I won't be gone forever.

29:42.316 --> 29:48.900
Where you headed?

29:50.566 --> 29:51.275
Trying to get out of England.

29:52.608 --> 29:52.858
Russia.

29:53.691 --> 29:54.108
On this?

29:56.191 --> 29:57.983
You know there's
planes and trains out, don't you?

30:00.358 --> 30:00.858
You on the run?

30:01.691 --> 30:01.900
Yes.

30:03.733 --> 30:04.108
I am.

30:05.025 --> 30:06.191
Come on, then. Come on.

She was weak.

32:48.150 --> 32:49.150
Sick in her mind.

She died because you sent her away.

32:53.608 --> 32:55.566
[shouting]

32:55.566 --> 32:55.775
Sergei!

32:59.108 --> 33:00.150
Fear will eat you.

33:00.983 --> 33:02.108
It makes you weak.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.525
Each of us has a path to walk.

33:08.608 --> 33:09.400
They are brave.

33:12.650 --> 33:13.566
We eat the pleasure.

34:20.566 --> 34:23.608
[gunfire]

34:23.608 --> 34:24.108
[gunshot]

34:24.108 --> 34:31.650

35:25.400 --> 35:25.483
[screaming]

35:25.483 --> 35:32.900
[gunfire]

35:32.900 --> 35:34.316

35:50.608 --> 35:51.566
[music playing]

36:20.608 --> 36:32.733
[music playing]

36:37.566 --> 36:38.108
Welcome home.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.483
We stayed under the radar as usual.

36:41.441 --> 36:42.525
Call me when you need me again.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.566
[music playing]

36:57.400 --> 37:09.941
[music playing]

37:09.941 --> 37:12.275
[phone ringing]

37:13.025 --> 37:14.691
Sergei, it is your father.

37:15.316 --> 37:15.858
Come home.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.191
I miss you.

37:17.483 --> 37:19.566
I am sorry for
everything that has happened.

37:21.566 --> 37:22.566
Just kidding.

37:23.025 --> 37:23.566
It's your brother.

37:24.441 --> 37:25.108
I texted you.

37:25.733 --> 37:26.275
Where have you been?

37:28.608 --> 37:31.108
Oh, you still
hiding out in the woods, huh?

37:32.358 --> 37:33.650
Am I going to see you for my birthday?

37:34.858 --> 37:35.483
Call me back.

37:41.900 --> 37:45.566
[sighing]

37:56.566 --> 37:57.691
[sighing]

38:22.900 --> 38:30.483
[sirens]

38:32.666 --> 38:34.125
Because we can.

38:48.791 --> 38:50.666
Hey, it was leisure.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.108
Because you can?

39:00.291 --> 39:14.666
Go, go!

39:01.525 --> 39:02.066
Out of way.

39:02.650 --> 39:04.066
There's six of us and only one of you.

39:05.775 --> 39:06.816
There are six of you now.

39:07.441 --> 39:08.858
I ain't got time for
this. I've got deadlines.

39:48.566 --> 39:50.483
[sighing]

40:09.566 --> 40:09.941
Mr. Tegeler.

40:11.566 --> 40:12.441
I apologize.

40:13.566 --> 40:15.566
This guy, he came out of nowhere.

40:15.608 --> 40:20.150
A crazy local or... I don't know.

40:21.316 --> 40:22.400
But I took care of it.

40:23.316 --> 40:24.650
He won't be bothering us anymore.

40:29.316 --> 40:31.483
In a moment, you won't
be bothered by much of anything.

40:31.900 --> 40:32.483
How did you...

40:34.816 --> 40:35.691
Where's Mr. Tegeler?

40:37.108 --> 40:38.483
Oh, you're standing in him.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.566
Found this interesting read.

40:45.775 --> 40:47.650
You're a poacher, Mr. Tegeler.

40:47.650 --> 40:49.566
He hires poachers with these names.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.941
Drugs, weapons, trafficking.

40:52.941 --> 40:53.608
No, no, no, I...

40:54.108 --> 40:54.650
What's your name?

40:56.316 --> 40:56.566
Andre.

40:57.025 --> 41:00.775
The men in that book,
they're the ones you want.

41:00.775 --> 41:03.233
They're the ones they
charge. I can help you find them.

41:03.983 --> 41:05.233
I don't need your help.

41:07.066 --> 41:09.108
But I will be
adding these names to my list.

41:11.108 --> 41:11.733
Andre who?

41:14.275 --> 41:14.566
The maid.

41:17.483 --> 41:18.858
Pretty low on a pecking order, Andre.

41:20.441 --> 41:22.400
Oh, found you.

41:35.066 --> 41:40.566
And now, today's headlines.

41:41.566 --> 41:44.733
Crusading London
prosecutor Samantha Hodges

41:44.733 --> 41:47.316
was gunned down
last week in broad daylight.

41:48.025 --> 41:52.775
Following a string of vicious attacks
targeting law enforcement and the judiciary.

41:54.441 --> 41:56.900
Memorial services
will be held later today.

42:02.566 --> 42:05.275
I met Samantha when
I first moved to London.

42:06.275 --> 42:07.566
She was a mentor,

42:07.608 --> 42:10.816
a dear friend,

42:12.150 --> 42:17.025
and one of the fiercest fighters
for justice this city has ever known.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.650
We all know who did this.

42:23.858 --> 42:29.191
Samantha dared to stand in Semyon
Chorny's way and hold him accountable.

42:30.816 --> 42:34.566
And for that act of
courage, she lost her life.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.608
This system's broken.

42:53.150 --> 42:54.483
I'm sorry about your friend.

42:54.483 --> 42:54.691
Shit.

42:56.191 --> 42:57.316
I didn't mean to scare you.

42:57.316 --> 42:57.775
You did.

42:59.525 --> 43:00.233
Sorry for your loss.

43:01.150 --> 43:02.108
Did you know her well?

43:03.816 --> 43:04.566
Actually, I didn't know her at all.

43:05.566 --> 43:07.733
Well, then thank you for the condolences.

43:10.858 --> 43:11.358
I live so.

43:15.191 --> 43:22.566
I think this belongs to you.

43:28.483 --> 43:28.775
You're...

43:31.066 --> 43:31.566
You're the boy.

43:31.608 --> 43:34.358
No, you were...

43:35.525 --> 43:36.025
You were...

43:36.025 --> 43:36.483
I was.

43:37.608 --> 43:38.566
For three minutes.

43:39.608 --> 43:41.441
Would have been a whole
lot longer if you hadn't been here.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.691
Those were my grandmother's cards.

43:45.150 --> 43:47.150
I actually still carry the dick with me.

43:48.525 --> 43:49.358
So why'd you give it to me?

43:50.900 --> 43:52.358
Yes, I thought you needed it.

43:54.108 --> 43:55.233
Is this how you had to go on?

43:56.191 --> 43:56.566
How'd you find me?

43:56.608 --> 44:02.983
Hunting people down is sort of my thing.

44:04.275 --> 44:04.525
Hunting?

44:05.941 --> 44:06.733
You know who did this?

44:08.941 --> 44:09.566
Yeah, I do.

44:11.900 --> 44:12.525
They gonna get him?

44:13.858 --> 44:14.650
Probably not.

44:18.900 --> 44:21.566
What would you say if I told you?

44:21.566 --> 44:24.566
I already did. (somber music)

44:51.608 --> 44:56.441
(somber music)

44:56.441 --> 45:03.233
A tiger's tooth?

45:03.858 --> 45:05.858
I use whatever tools are available.

45:07.566 --> 45:08.691
Why would you do that?

45:09.566 --> 45:11.108
Wasn't he
responsible for killing your friend?

45:13.400 --> 45:17.566
Look, I've been trying to
find you for a very long time.

45:19.233 --> 45:21.733
This is my way of saying
thank you for saving my life.

45:22.066 --> 45:23.275
I didn't ask you to murder anyone.

45:23.941 --> 45:24.608
I'm a lawyer.

45:28.566 --> 45:30.233
But that bastard got what he deserved.

45:34.650 --> 45:36.025
I know who your father is.

45:38.233 --> 45:38.900
You're like him?

45:40.400 --> 45:40.983
The gangster?

45:41.400 --> 45:41.566
No.

45:41.608 --> 45:48.483
I grew up watching my
father put evil into the world.

45:49.483 --> 45:51.150
The old man had it all figured out.

45:51.983 --> 45:54.441
I was supposed to follow in his footsteps

45:54.441 --> 45:57.066
and take over the family business.

45:58.525 --> 46:00.316
If something happened
to me that day, you found me.

46:03.483 --> 46:07.358
So, I got as far away
from my father as I could.

46:07.983 --> 46:09.566
Now I do what I can to
get rid of people who are not.

46:09.816 --> 46:12.233
Now I do what I can to
get rid of people like him.

46:13.775 --> 46:14.400
So you're the hunter?

46:16.150 --> 46:17.775
That's just what
they call me in the press.

46:20.191 --> 46:21.191
I prefer Craven.

46:22.108 --> 46:22.441
Craven?

46:23.066 --> 46:24.525
Mm. With a K.

46:25.025 --> 46:28.108
But the only people who
have heard that name are dead now.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.733
Then I guess I'll
just have to watch my back.

46:33.858 --> 46:34.691
So do you live here?

46:36.150 --> 46:38.566
I live about as far away as
you can possibly get from this place.

46:41.650 --> 46:42.483
But my brother does.

46:44.941 --> 46:45.900
We, um...

46:49.108 --> 46:52.941
I wasn't always there for
him, so I check in when I can.

46:55.400 --> 46:55.900
What about you?

46:56.941 --> 46:57.775
How did you end up here?

46:59.066 --> 47:00.358
Some days I'm not so sure.

47:02.275 --> 47:06.566
My parents were
lawyers, so that's what I did.

47:06.566 --> 47:09.733
I was in the
D.A.'s office in New York for

47:09.733 --> 47:12.358
seven years, until I
couldn't take it anymore.

47:13.650 --> 47:15.816
Sometimes the law can
get in the way of justice.

47:17.066 --> 47:17.566
It can.

47:20.275 --> 47:23.358
Now I'm in London, at one
of the biggest law firms in Europe.

47:25.108 --> 47:29.025
I know where you work. You're one of
the best investigative lawyers in that place.

47:30.275 --> 47:31.191
I also know...

47:33.150 --> 47:34.566
all your clients aren't exactly angels.

47:35.566 --> 47:36.691
That's true.

47:38.650 --> 47:40.691
So what are you really
getting down from behind that desk?

47:43.566 --> 47:44.191
I have a list.

47:45.608 --> 47:46.066
A list?

47:51.525 --> 47:54.566
There are other ways to do
what you set out to do, Calypso.

48:06.816 --> 48:08.150
Well, you're gonna need a lawyer, or

48:08.150 --> 48:10.358
worse, if you keep
messing around in this world.

48:13.608 --> 48:14.525
What about a partnership?

48:15.900 --> 48:19.941
From inside that firm, you can
find people I can't. And then I can...

48:19.941 --> 48:20.858
Yeah, I get it.

48:26.566 --> 48:27.858
I'll think about it.

48:29.275 --> 48:29.691
Craven.

48:31.233 --> 48:32.191
And a little friendly advice.

48:32.608 --> 48:35.108
If you keep going after the names on that

48:35.108 --> 48:39.150
list, people you
care about are gonna get hurt.

48:49.566 --> 48:50.066
Hey.

48:51.358 --> 48:51.608
Pleasure.

48:51.900 --> 48:52.900
We need to talk about this.

48:53.400 --> 48:53.691
Yes.

48:54.441 --> 48:54.983
We go again?

48:55.858 --> 48:56.566
Go! Go!

49:02.566 --> 49:03.275
Did you hear me?

49:04.858 --> 49:05.108
Pleasure.

49:06.566 --> 49:07.441
Calyn, give it here.

49:08.691 --> 49:09.900
Are you going to make me beg?

49:12.983 --> 49:13.775
You know I don't beg.

49:15.525 --> 49:16.566
You think I'm weak?

49:19.983 --> 49:20.941
Good damn thing.

49:24.566 --> 49:24.900
Pleasure!

49:25.233 --> 49:27.400
It's okay, Rezinka.

49:28.150 --> 49:29.566
Yes, you're my Rezinka.

49:29.608 --> 49:33.400
Papa loves you. Papa forgets you.

49:33.816 --> 49:34.566
One more thing.

49:36.025 --> 49:37.900
Sami and Chauni was
killed in his prison cell.

49:40.191 --> 49:41.025
Who got to him?

49:41.608 --> 49:42.650
They're saying he was the hunter.

49:44.691 --> 49:47.525
Faster than a cheetah, cunning as a fox.

49:49.108 --> 49:50.816
More ferocious than a tiger.

49:56.066 --> 49:56.566
Tell me.

49:57.566 --> 50:00.941
Do you think this hunter actually exists?

50:01.733 --> 50:02.525
It'd be a load of bollocks.

50:04.025 --> 50:05.525
But then again, I hear he's got a list.

50:06.108 --> 50:08.858
Once you're on it, you never come off.

50:11.358 --> 50:13.150
And there's a good chance you're on it.

50:16.566 --> 50:20.108
If it is real, it can be found.

50:21.566 --> 50:22.316
I'll do some digging.

50:24.150 --> 50:24.358
Wait.

50:26.941 --> 50:29.983
Chauni's operations are up for grabs now.

50:30.400 --> 50:31.066
Set a meet.

50:33.150 --> 50:34.233
He's top three guys.

50:58.066 --> 51:00.858
Your boss, Sibion Chauni, is dead.

51:02.108 --> 51:05.733
I intend to assume
control of his acid transactions.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.066
One of you will be my partner.

51:09.025 --> 51:09.816
Who's it going to be?

51:12.275 --> 51:13.066
Best pitch wins.

51:20.275 --> 51:21.566
Why they call me the Rhino.

51:27.566 --> 51:30.358
Why do it to yourself?

51:32.316 --> 51:37.400
They have to see
who they're dealing with.

51:45.566 --> 51:47.733
He's back, Sibion.

51:48.191 --> 51:55.566
Oh, it's okay, Raja.

51:56.608 --> 51:57.566
It's okay.

52:26.608 --> 52:32.691
[sighs]

52:32.691 --> 52:39.066
You can put your guns away.

52:39.358 --> 52:42.191
If I want you dead,
I only have to raise my...

52:42.191 --> 52:42.441
Don't!

52:48.525 --> 52:50.025
Whenever Rhino sees his
opportunity, he doesn't hesitate.

52:51.941 --> 52:53.233
He charges in and takes it.

52:54.566 --> 52:56.775
So I'll ask one more time...

52:58.941 --> 53:00.691
Which one of you
is going to be my partner?

53:04.275 --> 53:07.525
Hell of a pitch.

53:11.566 --> 53:12.566
We have a winner.

53:53.608 --> 53:58.775
[music playing]

54:02.650 --> 54:03.483
My son, Dimitri.

54:05.733 --> 54:07.400
This next one's for you, Papa.

54:11.150 --> 54:15.900
It does for me.

54:16.483 --> 54:18.108
He knows I like Tony Bennett.

54:18.483 --> 54:19.233
Do you like Tony Bennett?

54:20.566 --> 54:22.358
I don't trust anyone
who doesn't like Tony Bennett.

54:25.483 --> 54:26.233
He can do anyone.

54:26.775 --> 54:27.650
He's like Chameleon.

54:30.733 --> 54:31.275
He's assassins.

54:33.150 --> 54:35.400
If they can get your boss in cage,

54:36.858 --> 54:38.983
I think we all need to take precautions.

54:39.900 --> 54:40.566
I understand.

54:41.983 --> 54:42.441
Come closer.

54:45.441 --> 54:47.400
Jorny, he is gone.

54:48.941 --> 54:51.566
That makes your
operations become vulnerable.

54:53.608 --> 54:57.191
I can offer you security, distribution,

54:57.983 --> 55:00.650
and most critically, peace of mind.

55:02.191 --> 55:02.566
Sounds good.

55:03.441 --> 55:04.025
I'm on board.

55:06.066 --> 55:06.608
Just like that.

55:08.275 --> 55:09.691
You don't want to think about it.

55:09.941 --> 55:11.108
Order has to be restored.

55:12.358 --> 55:12.983
The sooner the better.

55:16.566 --> 55:19.525
You have already done deal, didn't you?

55:20.275 --> 55:20.566
Who is?

55:20.566 --> 55:23.233
The Rhino sends his regards.

55:50.608 --> 55:53.275
[yelling]

55:56.150 --> 55:56.608
Get up.

56:15.233 --> 56:15.441
You're hit.

56:16.816 --> 56:18.316
Are you all right, Papa?

56:20.608 --> 56:23.525
[clinking]

56:24.566 --> 56:26.983
Look at what they have done to my club.

56:30.525 --> 56:33.650
I get attacked on my own ground.

56:35.566 --> 56:37.775
And who do I have to feed me?

56:38.691 --> 56:41.275
My son, the piano player.

56:43.066 --> 56:44.441
Come on, hit me.

56:45.191 --> 56:45.691
Fight me!

56:47.566 --> 56:48.316
I need fighters.

56:48.566 --> 56:49.900
Look, I want...

56:51.608 --> 56:53.275
You won't even defend yourself.

57:00.566 --> 57:01.733
The Kravinov hit failed.

57:02.733 --> 57:03.858
All of our guys are dead.

57:15.191 --> 57:16.566
Nikolai is a tough old bear.

57:16.566 --> 57:18.566
He won't go quietly.

57:20.566 --> 57:23.525
I found these slips under my door.

57:39.275 --> 57:42.816
Nikolai Kravinov's
son, Sergei, is the hunter?

57:44.233 --> 57:45.566
But what is this, a Kravin?

57:47.400 --> 57:48.816
Apparently that's what he calls himself.

57:50.275 --> 57:51.483
This can't be real.

57:54.316 --> 57:54.608
Can it?

57:55.733 --> 57:56.108
Not sure.

57:57.400 --> 57:58.775
He put the foreigner on this.

57:59.441 --> 58:03.525
He is a bit of a freak, but he's
been obsessed with the hunter for years.

58:04.900 --> 58:07.566
Maybe he can figure
out what the fuck is going on.

58:48.941 --> 58:49.150
One.

58:52.358 --> 58:52.483
Two.

58:55.900 --> 58:56.150
Three.

59:07.441 --> 59:10.400
(gun fires)

59:18.108 --> 59:19.775
I'll be seeing you.

59:37.441 --> 59:38.441
(man laughs)

59:38.858 --> 59:39.566
Oh, that's great.

59:39.566 --> 59:40.400
Is it up under the river?

01:00:07.441 --> 01:00:09.316
(ominous music)

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.608
(ominous music)

01:00:36.608 --> 01:00:36.900
Surprise!

01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:37.941
(man screams)

01:00:38.316 --> 01:00:38.483
Jesus!

01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:39.858
You're gay!

01:00:41.108 --> 01:00:42.233
(man laughs)

01:00:43.316 --> 01:00:45.108
You scared the shit out of me.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.150
Happy birthday, baby brother.

01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:51.275
Love you, man.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.066
What are we gonna do, huh?

01:00:57.316 --> 01:00:58.316
Well, you're not wearing that.

01:00:58.816 --> 01:00:59.983
Great, let's stay in.

01:00:59.983 --> 01:01:00.191
What?

01:01:00.816 --> 01:01:01.858
It's my birthday.

01:01:02.566 --> 01:01:06.608
On your birthday, we
can go to the petting zoo

01:01:06.983 --> 01:01:09.858
or wherever it is you let loose,

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:12.816
but tonight, this.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.191
What makes you think I can fit in that?

01:01:17.191 --> 01:01:19.775
This is too big on me,
so it'd be perfect for you.

01:01:23.525 --> 01:01:23.691
Sorry.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.400
Thank you.

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.900
Pleasure.

01:01:25.858 --> 01:01:27.025
Nice perfume, by the way.

01:01:27.608 --> 01:01:29.025
Thanks, but I'm not actually wearing any.

01:01:32.316 --> 01:01:35.358
She was gonna find out soon enough.

01:01:36.983 --> 01:01:39.108
(man grunts)

01:01:39.816 --> 01:01:41.400
Papa was sitting right here.

01:01:42.275 --> 01:01:43.608
It all happened so fast.

01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:48.191
You find out what you're
made of in a moment like that.

01:01:48.525 --> 01:01:49.066
I'm a coward.

01:01:49.358 --> 01:01:50.400
You're not a coward.

01:01:51.191 --> 01:01:52.775
It's natural to feel fear.

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:54.150
That's just your instinct, talking.

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:56.233
Why don't we get to choose who we are?

01:01:56.775 --> 01:01:58.191
Why do I have to be me?

01:01:58.191 --> 01:02:00.400
I need to be strong, fearless.

01:02:00.691 --> 01:02:01.900
I would run towards the bullets.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.316
I would crumble to the ground.

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:05.191
You know, why would you
want to be anybody but yourself?

01:02:05.566 --> 01:02:07.191
So you respect me for once.

01:02:07.483 --> 01:02:10.191
Papa's a criminal,
so what good is his respect?

01:02:10.483 --> 01:02:12.108
You act like you
don't care what he thinks,

01:02:12.108 --> 01:02:15.400
that you're above
it, that he can't touch you.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.066
Well, he can.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.941
He made you hate people.

01:02:19.233 --> 01:02:20.191
I don't hate people.

01:02:22.316 --> 01:02:25.150
I hate what people
do, but I don't hate people.

01:02:27.316 --> 01:02:30.900
I guess then, Papa
was right about one thing.

01:02:31.483 --> 01:02:31.691
Yeah.

01:02:32.358 --> 01:02:32.691
Yes.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.400
Men should be the
only animal that is dreaded.

01:02:38.316 --> 01:02:40.025
I'm glad I didn't miss the party.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:44.275
How could I stay away and miss the chance

01:02:44.483 --> 01:02:45.900
and see both my sons?

01:02:48.441 --> 01:02:48.691
Dimitri.

01:02:51.066 --> 01:02:51.650
What are you?

01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:59.358
I don't expect you to
give me a hug, but a handshake?

01:03:05.025 --> 01:03:07.316
(sighs)

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:07.483
Tasha.

01:03:13.233 --> 01:03:15.191
I just came for one toast,

01:03:15.983 --> 01:03:20.316
to honor Dimitri on his big day.

01:03:21.233 --> 01:03:21.441
For?

01:03:26.441 --> 01:03:29.066
For men, not for boys.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.566
(somber music)

01:03:37.108 --> 01:03:37.733
Come on, Sergei.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.066
The Dikrivenovs.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.233
Maybe you'll learn
someday to forget the best

01:03:49.691 --> 01:03:51.775
and imagine future together.

01:03:53.566 --> 01:03:54.150
It's family.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.108
Vashis Durovia.

01:03:57.025 --> 01:03:57.650
Vashis Durovia.

01:03:59.608 --> 01:03:59.858
(clicks tongue)

01:03:59.858 --> 01:04:00.400
(laughing)

01:04:02.858 --> 01:04:03.233
Damn you.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.108
You okay?

01:04:11.608 --> 01:04:11.858
Sergei.

01:04:13.691 --> 01:04:18.441
I know why you come every year.

01:04:19.858 --> 01:04:26.108
Because you feel
guilty for leaving me with him.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.941
I forgive you for all.

01:04:33.358 --> 01:04:33.983
Everything.

01:04:39.941 --> 01:04:40.691
I'm sorry.

01:04:52.441 --> 01:04:52.650
Sergei!

01:04:56.816 --> 01:04:57.316
Sergei!

01:05:27.108 --> 01:05:27.316
(dramatic music)

01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:28.608
I never wanted to get married, did I?

01:05:29.858 --> 01:05:30.608
Hold that, will ya?

01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:33.483
Please, buddy?

01:05:40.275 --> 01:05:41.108
Penhouse, please.

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:48.191
I tried to hold it for you.

01:05:48.191 --> 01:05:48.733
No, you didn't.

01:05:51.566 --> 01:05:53.775
This, oh, that's my travel knife.

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.816
Use it for work.

01:05:55.733 --> 01:05:55.941
Yeah.

01:05:57.566 --> 01:05:58.233
What'd you do for work?

01:05:58.775 --> 01:05:58.941
Exactly.

01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.566
I hunt.

01:06:04.775 --> 01:06:04.983
I'm fine.

01:06:04.983 --> 01:06:05.191
I hunt with people.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.150
(audio distorts)

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:12.900
Dimitri!

01:06:21.191 --> 01:06:22.358
Please, please!

01:06:22.983 --> 01:06:23.775
Let go, now!

01:06:24.941 --> 01:06:25.733
( (growling)

01:06:37.275 --> 01:06:41.900
[grunting]

01:06:49.358 --> 01:06:51.650
Hey, wait, wait, wait, stop!

01:06:51.733 --> 01:06:52.691
Please, please, wait, wait, wait.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.275
We can figure this out.

01:06:54.608 --> 01:06:54.900
Put him under.

01:07:00.858 --> 01:07:12.108
[grunting]

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:14.900
There he is.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:16.816
Lose him.

01:07:18.608 --> 01:07:19.858
Get the fuck out of the way!

01:07:21.816 --> 01:07:22.316
Watch it!

01:07:31.441 --> 01:07:34.691
[grunting]

01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:44.025
Fuck!

01:07:47.816 --> 01:07:48.358
Go!

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:54.525
Faster!

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:01.608
Stop!

01:08:07.525 --> 01:08:16.358
[grunting]

01:08:20.858 --> 01:08:22.066
The matry!

01:08:26.858 --> 01:08:29.358
It's bulletproof idiot inside and out!

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:32.900
[knocking]

01:08:37.858 --> 01:08:38.733
Game off!

01:08:41.108 --> 01:08:44.441
[grunting]

01:09:02.025 --> 01:09:02.858
[grunting]

01:09:33.483 --> 01:09:39.275
[grunting]

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:45.025
[grunting]

01:09:45.025 --> 01:09:49.775
Go, go!

01:09:52.483 --> 01:09:54.066
[grunting]

01:10:02.733 --> 01:10:03.858
Hit!

01:10:30.858 --> 01:10:33.900
[grunting]

01:10:34.858 --> 01:10:35.191
Demon!

01:10:39.858 --> 01:10:40.150
Hello, sir.

01:10:40.608 --> 01:10:41.400
Is that something I can hook with?

01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:42.608
A towel, maybe.

01:10:43.983 --> 01:10:44.691
Thank you so much.

01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:46.233
Appreciate it.

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:55.483
Sir, I think you
left your shoes in the lobby.

01:10:55.858 --> 01:10:56.650
I'm pretty sure it did.

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:58.650
Why don't we go down
and have a look together?

01:10:58.858 --> 01:11:00.483
I'm not sure I have enough
votes in the world then, my friend.

01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:02.858
Brian, everything's fine.

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:03.525
He's a client.

01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:05.525
What the hell, Sergei?

01:11:06.233 --> 01:11:08.316
I told you I'd think about your offer.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.358
You cannot come in here like this.

01:11:10.983 --> 01:11:12.358
This is my place of business.

01:11:12.358 --> 01:11:13.150
I got my brother.

01:11:13.983 --> 01:11:14.858
Who got your brother?

01:11:15.316 --> 01:11:16.400
There were four of them.

01:11:17.566 --> 01:11:18.525
Took him from his place.

01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:20.608
So you saw them?

01:11:20.608 --> 01:11:21.566
There's just one guy.

01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:26.316
Dark hair, brown eyes,
got a scar on his left eye.

01:11:27.566 --> 01:11:27.941
Jesus.

01:11:28.983 --> 01:11:29.108
Jesus.

01:11:29.108 --> 01:11:29.816
You spoke to them.

01:11:30.358 --> 01:11:31.108
Not exactly.

01:11:32.858 --> 01:11:34.900
There was some screaming involved.

01:11:39.608 --> 01:11:39.900
Okay.

01:11:42.025 --> 01:11:42.983
Let's get into it then.

01:11:45.733 --> 01:11:47.191
I should have been there for one.

01:11:49.025 --> 01:11:53.483
I couldn't sleep, so I
left and went for a walk and--

01:11:53.858 --> 01:11:54.858
We're gonna find him.

01:11:56.858 --> 01:11:57.483
Okay?

01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:01.775
I'm gonna do what I do, get us a name,

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.358
and then you are going to do what you do,

01:12:07.566 --> 01:12:08.858
and we will get him back.

01:12:10.816 --> 01:12:13.608
I'm looking for a mercenary
just ran a kidnapping hop in London.

01:12:14.525 --> 01:12:15.900
Moonshapes, garters, left eye.

01:12:16.983 --> 01:12:19.025
Smokes Turkish
cigarettes, probably a national.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:20.900
Find him.

01:12:21.858 --> 01:12:31.525
What you know, don't you?

01:12:31.816 --> 01:12:33.691
My list of enemies is long.

01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:39.566
Look what they did to him.

01:12:40.858 --> 01:12:45.733
(sighs)

01:12:51.608 --> 01:12:52.441
How much do they want?

01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:56.816
20 million and 48 hours.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:02.358
Hey, man.

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:04.316
It is complicated.

01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:05.650
No, it's not.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:06.566
It's very simple.

01:13:07.733 --> 01:13:09.816
You have the money and he's your son.

01:13:10.483 --> 01:13:12.025
This is not about money.

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:13.816
This is about power.

01:13:17.691 --> 01:13:20.316
If I pay, I am weak.

01:13:21.483 --> 01:13:24.650
If I show weakness, I begin to lose

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:27.066
everything I've spent lifetime building.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.900
A lifetime building what?

01:13:30.816 --> 01:13:31.941
You're a drug dealer.

01:13:37.108 --> 01:13:38.233
You don't get to do that anymore.

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:40.941
Dimitri is innocent.

01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:44.775
You let him die,
his blood is on your hands.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.108
On my hands?

01:13:47.316 --> 01:13:47.900
My hands?

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:50.483
I did not abandon him.

01:13:51.941 --> 01:13:54.150
You abandoned him.

01:13:55.775 --> 01:13:56.025
You?

01:13:59.941 --> 01:14:01.900
He was dead the moment he was taken.

01:14:03.233 --> 01:14:04.900
Whether I pay or not.

01:14:07.233 --> 01:14:09.233
No, you don't know that.

01:14:09.983 --> 01:14:11.733
Yes, I know.

01:14:12.983 --> 01:14:15.066
Because that is what I would do.

01:14:16.066 --> 01:14:16.608
You're despicable.

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.066
Of course I want him back.

01:14:21.066 --> 01:14:22.900
I want both my sons back.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:28.066
Hm.

01:14:31.316 --> 01:14:31.400
Some legend you've become.

01:14:32.691 --> 01:14:37.525
Wake up.

01:14:40.816 --> 01:14:41.316
Take these.

01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:43.150
Antibiotics.

01:14:44.066 --> 01:14:45.400
Can't have you dying on me, can I?

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.608
Can't have you dying on me, can I?

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.400
I'm sorry. That's good.

01:15:35.025 --> 01:15:35.941
Omer Azdemir.

01:15:37.275 --> 01:15:40.108
He's holed up in the
monastery in the outskirts of Angkor.

01:15:41.108 --> 01:15:41.608
Thank you.

01:15:41.941 --> 01:15:43.983
You can thank me
by never calling me again.

01:15:45.025 --> 01:15:45.400
We'll see.

01:15:51.483 --> 01:15:54.608
How'd it go?

01:15:58.108 --> 01:15:59.400
She took it.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.775
Of course she took it.
I'm sorry. Of course she took it.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.358
But did she believe you?

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:04.608
Yeah, she trusts me.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.858
Which is why I want
double what your boss promised.

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:10.483
Double?

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:12.650
Why not triple?

01:16:14.066 --> 01:16:14.775
What game are you playing?

01:16:19.525 --> 01:16:19.566
One.

01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:22.775
Two.

01:16:24.775 --> 01:16:24.941
Three.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400
It's done.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:38.566
[phone rings]

01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:41.650
Get ready.

01:16:42.983 --> 01:16:45.650
The hunter is on his way.

01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:50.441
Sergei, the man you're
looking for is Omer Azdemir.

01:16:51.775 --> 01:16:54.525
I found an old monastery
in his family name in Turkey.

01:16:55.483 --> 01:16:57.691
And that is where
you'll find your brother.

01:16:59.525 --> 01:17:00.400
Thank you for this.

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:03.400
All right, Ellie. Let's go.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.400
[phone rings]

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.400
[phone rings]

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.400
[speaking in Turkish]

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.525
[gunshot]

01:19:02.525 --> 01:19:03.441
[gunshot]

01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:04.441
[screams]

01:19:04.816 --> 01:19:05.025
Hey!

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:06.400
How's your lube?

01:19:10.066 --> 01:19:10.358
It's him.

01:19:10.775 --> 01:19:10.983
What?

01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:13.233
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:19:14.691 --> 01:19:18.441
[screams]

01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:21.483
[gunshots]

01:19:21.483 --> 01:19:25.316
[screams]

01:19:25.316 --> 01:19:27.441
[gunshots]

01:19:27.441 --> 01:19:27.650
[screams]

01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:27.816
[gunshots]

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.983
[screams]

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:32.358
He's there.

01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:36.691
[gunshots]

01:19:36.691 --> 01:19:38.316
[screams]

01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:39.608
[screams]

01:19:40.066 --> 01:19:40.691
Where's the matrix?

01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:43.691
[screams]

01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:44.608
[gunshots]

01:19:44.608 --> 01:19:45.400
[screams]

01:19:46.191 --> 01:19:46.858
Where is he?

01:19:48.233 --> 01:19:52.400
Drop me, and you'll
never find your brother, Craven.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.775
[crying]

01:19:56.775 --> 01:20:04.733
[screams]

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:09.150
[gunshots]

01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:15.025
[screams]

01:20:15.025 --> 01:20:19.691
How do you know my name?

01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:21.400
Who set me up?

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.983
Who took my brother?

01:20:24.816 --> 01:20:25.191
Vereino.

01:20:26.233 --> 01:20:27.691
He's killed us both now.

01:20:28.691 --> 01:20:30.900
[gunshots]

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.066
[gunshots]

01:20:32.066 --> 01:20:32.275
Run!

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:35.733
[gunshots]

01:20:35.733 --> 01:20:36.650
[screams]

01:20:36.650 --> 01:20:40.025
[gunshots]

01:20:40.025 --> 01:20:41.608
[screams]

01:20:41.608 --> 01:20:41.775
[gunshots] [gunshots]

01:21:00.858 --> 01:21:03.191
This is crushed rosary piece.

01:21:05.316 --> 01:21:06.900
The man who did this knows his toxins.

01:21:09.983 --> 01:21:10.191
One.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:13.066
Two.

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.025
Three.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.191
[gunshot]

01:21:20.191 --> 01:21:20.775
What are you doing?

01:21:25.733 --> 01:21:26.150
Pecena.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400
It's enough, Raja.

01:21:36.566 --> 01:21:38.108
I'm very sorry about your finger.

01:21:38.733 --> 01:21:39.441
Co-eteral damage.

01:21:40.691 --> 01:21:41.400
Cut him free.

01:21:47.816 --> 01:21:48.566
We met once.

01:21:49.775 --> 01:21:51.400
On your father's hunting trip.

01:21:52.025 --> 01:21:53.775
I, uh, don't remember.

01:21:55.025 --> 01:21:55.650
No, you wouldn't.

01:21:56.233 --> 01:21:57.358
My hair was different.

01:21:58.566 --> 01:21:59.400
You were very young.

01:22:00.358 --> 01:22:00.608
Me?

01:22:03.608 --> 01:22:04.441
I never forgot.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:09.275
So have you spoken to my father?

01:22:10.483 --> 01:22:12.566
Has he agreed to pay?

01:22:13.483 --> 01:22:13.858
No.

01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:17.191
Nikolai Kravinov
was never going to hand over

01:22:17.191 --> 01:22:19.858
20 million dollars
to get his bastard son back.

01:22:22.233 --> 01:22:24.525
You're an accident, Dimitri.

01:22:26.858 --> 01:22:28.941
You came into this world as an accident,

01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:32.275
and you came into my
possession as an accident.

01:22:33.941 --> 01:22:34.483
So can I go?

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:36.275
There's men who took you.

01:22:37.025 --> 01:22:38.233
They weren't there for you.

01:22:39.525 --> 01:22:40.733
They were there for your brother.

01:22:41.733 --> 01:22:43.400
Sergei, both of you went in.

01:22:44.775 --> 01:22:46.400
But when my guys got up there,

01:22:46.608 --> 01:22:50.066
oof, he'd vanished, as he always does.

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:52.566
So I took you.

01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:54.275
I got lucky.

01:22:54.983 --> 01:22:56.400
Why would you ever want Sergei?

01:22:57.775 --> 01:22:58.691
He never hurt anyone.

01:22:58.983 --> 01:23:00.400
I really don't know, do you?

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:01.608
Know what?

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:08.941
Wait for the end.

01:23:09.733 --> 01:23:10.400
That's the best part.

01:23:15.066 --> 01:23:15.525
Kravin?

01:23:24.483 --> 01:23:26.816
Apparently that's
what he calls himself now.

01:23:27.816 --> 01:23:29.983
You think my
brother, Sergei, is the hunter?

01:23:30.691 --> 01:23:32.108
The hunter is a story,

01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:34.608
a fable to put fear into criminals.

01:23:35.191 --> 01:23:37.400
Clearly you didn't
know your brother very well.

01:23:38.066 --> 01:23:38.900
What do you mean didn't?

01:23:39.608 --> 01:23:40.608
Kravin had a list.

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:43.441
Once you're on it, you never come off.

01:23:51.775 --> 01:23:53.108
So I went to check him first.

01:24:01.816 --> 01:24:05.441
Let me record this.

01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:09.400
We've got Kravin.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.733
Eh, I don't know about that.

01:24:26.566 --> 01:24:30.483
Hello? Eliso, it's me.

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:31.900
The whole thing was a trap.

01:24:32.108 --> 01:24:32.566
The Rhino?

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:33.983
He knows who I am.

01:24:33.983 --> 01:24:34.983
He'll be after you next.

01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:36.275
Sergei, what are you...

01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:37.358
Shit.

01:24:37.941 --> 01:24:39.400
There are five guys
walking into my building right now

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.525
who do not look like they belong here.

01:24:42.358 --> 01:24:43.650
You need to get out of there now.

01:24:43.983 --> 01:24:46.150
Get to the cargo terminal and stance it.

01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:47.400
I'll have someone meet you there.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.775
[dramatic music]

01:25:15.066 --> 01:25:16.816
I call this my feed bag.

01:25:19.191 --> 01:25:23.066
It's a mixture of
medications to manage my condition.

01:25:24.316 --> 01:25:25.108
What happened to you?

01:25:25.566 --> 01:25:27.316
I was underestimated, too.

01:25:28.441 --> 01:25:29.650
In and out of hospitals,

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:31.566
they never quite knew what was wrong.

01:25:32.525 --> 01:25:35.608
I knew I would never
have your father's respect

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.400
or anyone else's.

01:25:40.066 --> 01:25:41.441
Until I was strong.

01:25:42.566 --> 01:25:43.941
I tried everything.

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:45.691
And then...

01:25:46.858 --> 01:25:47.858
[dog barking]

01:25:47.858 --> 01:25:51.608
I found someone in New York,

01:25:53.358 --> 01:25:54.400
a biochemist,

01:25:55.108 --> 01:25:57.025
and Professor Miles Warren.

01:25:57.983 --> 01:26:04.150
He was developing a
procedure to increase strength tenfold.

01:26:07.191 --> 01:26:08.483
I signed up on the spot.

01:26:15.108 --> 01:26:17.733
My skin, it started to harden.

01:26:18.441 --> 01:26:21.858
I was indestructible,

01:26:21.858 --> 01:26:24.566
like a rhino.

01:26:26.566 --> 01:26:27.983
But the pain...

01:26:31.650 --> 01:26:32.400
It was too much.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:37.150
[gunshot]

01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:51.775
[sighs]

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.941
I think there is an
animal in each one of us, Dimitri.

01:26:58.691 --> 01:27:00.400
I'm taking over your father's territory.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.608
I want you to be my partner.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.941
The Kravinoff name
still opens a lot of doors,

01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:09.525
and you'll finally get
the consideration you deserve.

01:27:12.025 --> 01:27:12.400
You're right.

01:27:15.025 --> 01:27:19.400
I have been underestimated my whole life.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.650
But if you think
I'm gonna betray my family,

01:27:29.733 --> 01:27:32.150
you're wrong.

01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:39.775
Boss.

01:27:41.441 --> 01:27:42.275
The boys haven't checked in.

01:27:42.816 --> 01:27:44.566
I can't reach them.

01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:50.941
Kravin is alive.

01:27:52.191 --> 01:27:52.733
Hey, Bart!

01:27:55.483 --> 01:27:56.400
I'm off with him, probably.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.400
He's here.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.191
[thunder]

01:28:30.191 --> 01:28:36.566
[growl]

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.858
Cute.

01:28:47.275 --> 01:28:50.900
Will your trick still work when
I remove your eyeballs from your head?

01:28:52.316 --> 01:28:52.566
Relax.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.608
[engine revs]

01:29:06.566 --> 01:29:08.441
Sorry I got you wrapped up in all this.

01:29:08.691 --> 01:29:09.816
Any word on Dimitri?

01:29:10.483 --> 01:29:11.025
Not yet.

01:29:11.483 --> 01:29:14.983
Three of my sources have gone
offline while tracking the rhino's plane.

01:29:16.108 --> 01:29:18.316
I don't like the feel of this at all.

01:29:20.650 --> 01:29:22.066
So, what is this place?

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:24.608
My mother's family
used to own this property.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.066
Well, it's really the
only thing I have left from her.

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.608
What is happening right now?

01:29:36.525 --> 01:29:37.441
We're being hunted.

01:29:39.108 --> 01:29:39.608
By who?

01:29:42.316 --> 01:29:43.900
[grunting]

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:59.025
[growling]

01:29:59.025 --> 01:30:04.608
You don't hunt me!

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.316
Yeah, get this.

01:30:06.983 --> 01:30:08.566
What are you gonna do? Come on, show me.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.858
I've seen her around
since she was a cub, but...

01:30:21.441 --> 01:30:22.858
it's a lot bigger than I remember.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.108
You're a goddamn lunatic, I swear.

01:30:26.608 --> 01:30:27.941
Oh, you just figured that out now.

01:30:29.941 --> 01:30:31.858
I know I hired you for the job.

01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:36.358
But who is craving
to you? Why the obsession?

01:30:37.483 --> 01:30:40.191
My mentor was one of the
greatest assassins who ever lived.

01:30:40.691 --> 01:30:42.025
He taught me everything I know.

01:30:42.816 --> 01:30:43.816
He was like a brother to me.

01:30:44.983 --> 01:30:45.650
Maybe you knew him?

01:30:47.316 --> 01:30:48.400
Hmm, I'll see him.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.150
He was murdered.

01:30:53.191 --> 01:30:55.733
One man made it
inside and cut his throat.

01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:57.108
Craven?

01:30:59.775 --> 01:31:03.483
So I traveled the world,
followed him wherever he went.

01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:06.483
But Craven is nature's perfect predator.

01:31:08.233 --> 01:31:09.400
He has no known weaknesses.

01:31:13.608 --> 01:31:14.358
But you found one.

01:31:15.483 --> 01:31:17.400
And I know how to exploit it.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.483
I'm going to the part
where I start to give a shit.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.316
These are Eastern Siberian rosary peas.

01:31:27.316 --> 01:31:28.108
A rare species.

01:31:29.316 --> 01:31:31.483
I found their residue
on a poison in the monastery.

01:31:32.816 --> 01:31:35.858
These peas are only native
to a specific region in Siberia.

01:31:38.566 --> 01:31:39.400
That's where we'll find them.

01:31:58.275 --> 01:32:12.108
Oh, careful with that.)

01:32:14.358 --> 01:32:15.983
Actually, I'm pretty
good with one of these things.

01:32:17.150 --> 01:32:19.691
Archery at summer camp.

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.066
Figuert,

01:32:25.025 --> 01:32:27.108
Woodaven's

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.066
Tribulus.

01:32:29.191 --> 01:32:29.900
Mm-hmm.

01:32:31.483 --> 01:32:32.066
Rosary peas?

01:32:33.108 --> 01:32:34.400
You seem to know your stuff.

01:32:36.108 --> 01:32:36.650
They'll kill you.

01:32:37.275 --> 01:32:38.066
Or save you.

01:32:39.025 --> 01:32:40.108
Nature's funny like that.

01:32:41.983 --> 01:32:42.941
What are you trying to do here?

01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:48.066
Tell me about this.

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:51.316
It was my grandmother's.

01:32:52.691 --> 01:32:54.608
We were on safari visiting her that day.

01:32:55.066 --> 01:32:58.066
I've been trying to figure
out what was in here for years.

01:32:59.775 --> 01:33:01.566
My grandmother was kind of a...

01:33:03.066 --> 01:33:03.275
Mystic.

01:33:04.608 --> 01:33:05.816
She had a lot of crazy stuff around.

01:33:07.775 --> 01:33:11.691
My parents didn't like to talk
about it, but she was a very powerful woman.

01:33:13.733 --> 01:33:15.900
She said it would
heal whoever drank it in...

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:18.691
Undreamed of ways.

01:33:19.983 --> 01:33:21.566
I was... I was just a kid.

01:33:22.066 --> 01:33:24.150
I didn't know what it would actually do.

01:33:24.608 --> 01:33:25.691
This saved my life.

01:33:26.775 --> 01:33:27.191
Did it?

01:33:27.733 --> 01:33:29.066
Trust me. Change me.

01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:29.816
Exactly.

01:33:31.566 --> 01:33:32.525
Look at what you became.

01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:39.400
I need to know what was in here.

01:33:42.733 --> 01:33:43.608
And if you can get any more.

01:33:44.816 --> 01:33:45.108
No.

01:33:48.233 --> 01:33:50.691
She died not long after
that trip, and I never saw her again.

01:33:59.150 --> 01:34:00.441
I heard back from one of my sources.

01:34:01.108 --> 01:34:03.983
The rhino's on the move.
We should know more very soon.

01:34:04.608 --> 01:34:05.816
I knew you'd be good at this.

01:34:09.358 --> 01:34:12.233
Sergei, we're gonna get Dimitri back.

01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:15.525
But is all of this really worth it?

01:34:16.441 --> 01:34:19.066
Clipso, I was made to do this.

01:34:20.691 --> 01:34:22.858
I'm the greatest hunter
on this planet, it's undeniable.

01:34:24.275 --> 01:34:26.816
There's nobody I can't
track down, nobody I can't beat.

01:34:26.816 --> 01:34:28.608
There's nobody can even touch me, so no.

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.066
Why would I want to stop?

01:34:31.066 --> 01:34:33.400
It's called karma. She catches up to you.

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.525
Not me. I'm faster than she is.

01:34:42.108 --> 01:34:43.900
But Dimitri wasn't.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.400
Interesting piece.

01:34:56.275 --> 01:34:57.941
It's gonna take more
than a gun to kill Kraven.

01:34:58.733 --> 01:35:02.108
I find this formula that was
developed by MI6 to be particularly effective.

01:35:03.858 --> 01:35:05.191
May I?

01:35:10.316 --> 01:35:14.691
It first brings on your darkest
nightmares, then paralysis of your vital organs,

01:35:15.191 --> 01:35:16.650
before a most violent death.

01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:20.400
I like your style.

01:35:28.483 --> 01:35:33.441
Only one person has this number.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.566
Dima, where are you?

01:35:36.983 --> 01:35:39.691
Sergei, I'm sorry,
they made me call you...

01:35:40.066 --> 01:35:40.400
Dimitri.

01:35:41.358 --> 01:35:44.191
I'm afraid not. But
now you know he is alive.

01:35:44.441 --> 01:35:45.066
What do you want?

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.400
A life without looking over my shoulder.

01:35:50.066 --> 01:35:54.275
You have two choices. I know
you hate your father as much as I do.

01:35:54.775 --> 01:36:01.316
So, you and I, and young
Dimitri here, we work together.

01:36:01.733 --> 01:36:02.900
You could be my partners.

01:36:03.441 --> 01:36:05.233
Or I kill you and burn...

01:36:11.691 --> 01:36:14.400
Okay then. Now we go hunt the hunter.

01:36:26.816 --> 01:36:32.900
Spread out.

01:36:34.816 --> 01:36:35.691
Bring me his body.

01:36:37.566 --> 01:36:38.316
Well, don't come back.

01:36:59.233 --> 01:36:59.400
Roger.

01:37:00.316 --> 01:37:05.608
Where is he?

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.400
He's already here.

01:38:05.483 --> 01:38:11.233
Translator,

01:38:11.233 --> 01:38:15.108
(screaming)

01:38:19.233 --> 01:38:22.358
Amateurs, so embarrassing for us.

01:38:23.358 --> 01:38:23.816
Do it.

01:38:26.775 --> 01:38:27.441
Start the run.

01:38:31.316 --> 01:38:33.900
(grunting)

01:38:38.316 --> 01:38:39.358
Fire in the hole.

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:41.483
Gotta be kidding.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:53.525
(exploding)

01:38:53.525 --> 01:38:55.983
(panting)

01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:16.900
(grunting)

01:39:47.275 --> 01:39:48.983
Their
hallucinations are just the beginning.

01:39:51.608 --> 01:39:52.900
Are you seeing your worst nightmare?

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:56.566
One.

01:39:59.233 --> 01:39:59.400
Two.

01:40:02.566 --> 01:40:02.733
Three.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.525
(panting)

01:40:09.233 --> 01:40:12.400
As the poison makes
its way to your spinal cord,

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.816
you'll begin to lose all motor functions.

01:40:15.608 --> 01:40:16.400
Then it's fixation.

01:40:17.691 --> 01:40:18.400
So you're the legend.

01:40:21.233 --> 01:40:21.691
The myth.

01:40:25.483 --> 01:40:27.816
Well look at you now, you're just a myth.

01:40:33.441 --> 01:40:43.150
(grunting)

01:40:44.525 --> 01:40:44.816
Fire.

01:40:48.650 --> 01:40:51.233
(grunting)

01:41:03.441 --> 01:41:04.816
(grunting)

01:41:04.858 --> 01:41:06.191
You give them help, Craven.

01:41:07.275 --> 01:41:09.525
(grunting)

01:41:20.816 --> 01:41:23.441
Honestly, I thought that would be harder.

01:41:28.025 --> 01:41:30.900
It's done, but the
brother's still out there.

01:41:31.566 --> 01:41:32.191
Go find him.

01:41:33.358 --> 01:41:33.900
Let's go.

01:41:36.816 --> 01:41:36.983
One.

01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:39.316
Two.

01:41:40.441 --> 01:41:40.941
(gun firing)

01:41:43.191 --> 01:41:43.941
Three, motherfucker.

01:41:45.025 --> 01:41:46.483
Goodbye, Craven the Hunser.

01:41:52.275 --> 01:41:52.441
Sergei.

01:41:58.066 --> 01:41:59.358
Can't catch a break, can you, mate?

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:10.191
(gasping)

01:42:24.858 --> 01:42:26.775
Legends, don't die.

01:42:27.316 --> 01:42:29.150
Now get the fuck up, Craven.

01:42:29.441 --> 01:42:35.191
(dramatic music)

01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:39.108
(gasping)

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:47.441
I knew you had more of that.

01:42:48.025 --> 01:42:50.400
Well forgive me
for not trusting a lunatic

01:42:51.316 --> 01:42:52.900
with my family's deepest legacy.

01:42:55.150 --> 01:42:55.483
Get up.

01:42:57.233 --> 01:42:57.525
Okay.

01:42:59.441 --> 01:43:00.650
(sighing)

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.400
Well that must be some summer, Kent.

01:43:04.233 --> 01:43:05.650
You're not the only one with secrets.

01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:08.400
Don't make me regret this.

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.400
(dramatic music)

01:43:19.316 --> 01:43:19.816
It's over.

01:43:21.816 --> 01:43:22.316
Craven's dead.

01:43:22.525 --> 01:43:28.316
(laughing)

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:29.983
What a day.

01:43:32.733 --> 01:43:33.650
(laughing)

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.275
Put him in the car.

01:43:40.108 --> 01:43:42.150
Who knows, maybe Nikolai will pay now

01:43:42.150 --> 01:43:43.650
that he has only one son left.

01:43:44.775 --> 01:43:47.358
(dramatic music)

01:43:52.525 --> 01:43:59.441
(dramatic music)

01:44:03.525 --> 01:44:07.900
Does anyone else
see what I'm seeing here?

01:44:11.191 --> 01:44:15.400
(engine revving)

01:44:22.525 --> 01:44:34.108
(dramatic music)

01:44:34.108 --> 01:44:39.900
(crashing)

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:44.941
(screaming)

01:44:52.525 --> 01:45:07.608
(dramatic music)

01:45:08.566 --> 01:45:09.400
Craven!

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:15.275
(dramatic music)

01:45:21.983 --> 01:45:22.733
Gosh, you're really heavy.

01:45:25.566 --> 01:45:50.275
(screaming) (dramatic music)

01:45:50.275 --> 01:45:51.900
(screaming)

01:45:54.066 --> 01:46:12.400
Suggie. (dramatic music)

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.108
(crashing)

01:46:16.108 --> 01:46:23.483
(grunting)

01:46:23.483 --> 01:46:26.525
(grunting)

01:46:26.525 --> 01:46:28.441
(groaning)

01:46:28.441 --> 01:46:32.358
(dramatic music)

01:46:32.358 --> 01:46:33.983
(grunting)

01:46:39.858 --> 01:46:53.275
(dramatic music)

01:46:53.275 --> 01:46:55.733
(groaning)

01:46:55.733 --> 01:46:57.066
(crashing)

01:46:57.066 --> 01:46:58.525
(dramatic music)

01:46:58.525 --> 01:47:12.400
(groaning) My father
was right about one thing.

01:47:14.150 --> 01:47:14.983
You are nothing.

01:47:19.191 --> 01:47:22.108
(dramatic music)

01:47:22.108 --> 01:47:25.191
(crashing)

01:47:25.191 --> 01:47:27.858
(groaning)

01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:32.566
(groaning)

01:47:32.566 --> 01:47:37.441
(dramatic music)

01:47:39.441 --> 01:47:42.941
(groaning)

01:47:42.941 --> 01:47:51.608
(crashing)

01:47:51.608 --> 01:47:54.483
(groaning)

01:47:54.483 --> 01:47:54.983
(groaning)

01:47:54.983 --> 01:47:57.358
(crashing)

01:47:57.358 --> 01:47:58.650
(groaning)

01:47:58.650 --> 01:47:59.400
(crashing)

01:48:04.025 --> 01:48:06.816
(crashing)

01:48:06.816 --> 01:48:12.441
(groaning)

01:48:12.441 --> 01:48:19.025
(coughing)

01:48:19.316 --> 01:48:20.941
It's no video of me, how did you get it?

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:23.525
(coughing)

01:48:24.733 --> 01:48:25.191
Who sent it?

01:48:26.525 --> 01:48:27.275
(groaning)

01:48:27.441 --> 01:48:30.983
How is it that even the great hunter

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:36.275
can't see what was
always right in front of him?

01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:41.316
(coughing)

01:48:41.316 --> 01:48:43.608
(crunching)

01:48:48.525 --> 01:48:48.733
No.

01:48:51.316 --> 01:48:53.108
He deserves to die.

01:48:53.733 --> 01:48:54.150
He will.

01:48:55.441 --> 01:48:56.900
But Demetria is not you.

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:10.900
(dramatic music)

01:49:11.775 --> 01:49:12.150
I wish,

01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:19.358
I wish I never met you, Kravinovs.

01:49:20.691 --> 01:49:22.858
(groaning)

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.066
(dramatic music)

01:49:34.066 --> 01:49:41.775
(door opening)

01:49:44.858 --> 01:49:45.066
Whoa.

01:49:47.608 --> 01:49:49.650
(growling)

01:49:51.775 --> 01:49:58.066
(growling)

01:50:00.108 --> 01:50:02.900
Tharga, how did you find me?

01:50:04.358 --> 01:50:04.983
I'm a hunter.

01:50:07.358 --> 01:50:09.483
It's what we do.

01:50:13.525 --> 01:50:18.441
You sent the video
and told the rhino who I was.

01:50:20.816 --> 01:50:24.108
Did you really think
Father would not recognize

01:50:24.108 --> 01:50:25.608
actions of his own son?

01:50:26.816 --> 01:50:29.316
An assassin who uses all the methods

01:50:29.316 --> 01:50:31.275
of animals of the jungle?

01:50:34.108 --> 01:50:37.358
You of all people
should recognize and appreciate

01:50:37.358 --> 01:50:39.441
the beauty of the trap I set.

01:50:41.941 --> 01:50:45.733
The rhino has come for you.

01:50:47.566 --> 01:50:48.316
He went strong enough
that he could not be found.

01:50:48.483 --> 01:50:50.066
You had to fight
him off by yourself, huh?

01:50:50.566 --> 01:50:50.900
Exactly.

01:50:52.691 --> 01:50:57.025
But my son, my real son, Kravin,

01:50:59.108 --> 01:51:00.150
no one is stronger.

01:51:02.316 --> 01:51:06.775
And I knew you
would not go after him for me.

01:51:09.358 --> 01:51:10.733
So I sent him after you.

01:51:12.983 --> 01:51:13.566
Some trap.

01:51:13.941 --> 01:51:17.150
(sighing)

01:51:17.566 --> 01:51:18.941
I mean, Dimitri could have died,

01:51:18.941 --> 01:51:20.483
but that's the price
of doing business, right?

01:51:20.733 --> 01:51:22.316
No, no, no, no, no.

01:51:22.483 --> 01:51:26.525
Because I know you
would not let anything happen

01:51:26.733 --> 01:51:28.108
to our precious Dimitri.

01:51:30.233 --> 01:51:32.150
Our empire is secure.

01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:33.316
So what now?

01:51:34.358 --> 01:51:38.733
Papa, we forget about the past.

01:51:40.108 --> 01:51:42.025
Imagine a future together.

01:51:44.191 --> 01:51:45.650
His family.

01:52:00.650 --> 01:52:02.650
Sergei, where are you going?

01:52:09.525 --> 01:52:13.275
I could have come for you years ago.

01:52:15.316 --> 01:52:16.108
But I didn't.

01:52:18.316 --> 01:52:19.483
After everything you'd done,

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.191
all the pain you put in the world,

01:52:25.775 --> 01:52:26.525
you were my father.

01:52:29.066 --> 01:52:29.775
I still am.

01:52:32.108 --> 01:52:32.400
Sit.

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:46.441
(somber music)

01:52:46.775 --> 01:52:47.691
Never fear death.

01:52:50.275 --> 01:52:51.191
Isn't that what you taught me?

01:52:55.775 --> 01:52:58.900
(ominous music)

01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:09.483
(phone ringing)

01:53:13.941 --> 01:53:15.358
(growling)

01:53:15.358 --> 01:53:25.150
(somber music)

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:36.858
I feel unhappy

01:53:39.733 --> 01:53:41.441
I feel so sad

01:53:44.066 --> 01:53:46.358
I've lost the best friend

01:53:48.525 --> 01:53:50.816
That I'll ever had

01:53:55.566 --> 01:54:00.650
I'm going to change it

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.941
Happy birthday, Dima.

01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:12.066
It is a happy birthday.

01:54:14.441 --> 01:54:15.400
First one in a long time.

01:54:16.691 --> 01:54:18.025
And that's thanks to you, Sergei.

01:54:18.983 --> 01:54:20.066
Oh, come on.

01:54:20.066 --> 01:54:21.275
Or Craven, should I say.

01:54:21.816 --> 01:54:22.691
What do I call you now?

01:54:23.441 --> 01:54:24.191
Mr. Craven?

01:54:24.233 --> 01:54:24.983
You know who I am.

01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:25.900
I know you.

01:54:29.941 --> 01:54:33.775
That was hell, what I went through.

01:54:34.525 --> 01:54:36.525
But it also freed me.

01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:41.608
I feel almost born again.

01:54:43.941 --> 01:54:46.275
I found a doctor in New York.

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:49.025
A little unorthodox, I must admit.

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:53.525
But he really helped me.

01:54:53.983 --> 01:54:57.650
I mean, changed me.

01:54:58.983 --> 01:54:59.400
How so?

01:54:59.941 --> 01:55:00.566
Hang on a sec.

01:55:03.691 --> 01:55:05.941
(speaking in foreign language)

01:55:10.025 --> 01:55:12.150
Since when did you
have friends in the brotha, huh?

01:55:12.483 --> 01:55:13.816
Well, I have business, lots of people.

01:55:14.150 --> 01:55:14.441
Business?

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:17.025
I thought you said you
were gonna sell Papa's assets

01:55:17.025 --> 01:55:18.025
and get out of the business.

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.316
I changed my mind.

01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:21.358
Dima, I didn't pull your ass out to fire,

01:55:21.358 --> 01:55:22.525
so you can become a man like our father.

01:55:22.983 --> 01:55:23.525
Are you serious?

01:55:24.191 --> 01:55:26.400
You put my ass in that fire.

01:55:27.066 --> 01:55:28.650
You're a man just like our father.

01:55:28.650 --> 01:55:29.858
No, I'm nothing like him.

01:55:30.608 --> 01:55:31.400
I have a code.

01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.400
And you're different than him.

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.400
I'm better than him.

01:55:33.483 --> 01:55:35.441
You're not better than him.

01:55:36.025 --> 01:55:36.691
You're worse.

01:55:38.566 --> 01:55:40.025
How did Papa die again?

01:55:42.441 --> 01:55:43.483
A hunting accident.

01:55:44.691 --> 01:55:45.150
Was it?

01:55:46.108 --> 01:55:46.900
Don't lie to me.

01:55:48.691 --> 01:55:50.941
You think you have
some kind of honor, huh?

01:55:51.858 --> 01:55:52.650
Some kind of code.

01:55:53.983 --> 01:55:54.316
Bullshit.

01:55:56.150 --> 01:56:01.108
You're just another
man hunting for a trophy.

01:56:01.150 --> 01:56:09.275
(dramatic music)

01:56:11.233 --> 01:56:11.400
Hey.

01:56:15.358 --> 01:56:15.691
Dimitri.

01:56:24.566 --> 01:56:26.191
You should see the look on your face.

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:33.900
(dramatic music)

01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:36.316
Hey.

01:56:41.150 --> 01:56:41.441
Dimitri.

01:56:43.108 --> 01:56:43.775
You know me.

01:56:44.941 --> 01:56:46.275
I've always been a chameleon.

01:56:48.316 --> 01:56:50.233
It's the one thing I was ever good at.

01:56:51.275 --> 01:56:52.108
Who is this doctor?

01:56:53.566 --> 01:56:54.275
What did he do to you?

01:56:54.316 --> 01:56:55.525
You want me to be weak,

01:56:56.441 --> 01:56:58.816
so then you can be
strong, but I'm strong now.

01:56:59.858 --> 01:57:02.108
I can be whoever I want to be.

01:57:02.608 --> 01:57:04.858
The rhino is gone, dad is gone.

01:57:05.275 --> 01:57:06.316
It's all just there.

01:57:07.650 --> 01:57:08.400
For the taking.

01:57:10.816 --> 01:57:11.983
I'm gonna take it.

01:57:16.275 --> 01:57:18.566
You know I can't let you do that.

01:57:23.233 --> 01:57:24.025
Go home, Craven.

01:57:30.066 --> 01:57:31.108
Dad left you something.

01:57:42.691 --> 01:58:05.275
(singing in foreign language)
(dramatic music)

01:58:06.108 --> 01:58:09.733
Sergei, each of us has path to walk.

01:58:11.483 --> 01:58:13.191
Embrace who you really are,

01:58:14.108 --> 01:58:15.941
and you will have
the strength to walk it.

01:58:17.650 --> 01:58:19.066
You are more than my child.

01:58:21.608 --> 01:58:22.150
You are me.

01:58:24.733 --> 01:58:25.733
And I am you.

01:58:28.858 --> 01:58:31.900
(singing in foreign language)

01:58:32.233 --> 01:58:32.941
We are hunters.

01:58:36.025 --> 01:58:38.025
The greatest the world has ever known.

01:58:40.066 --> 01:58:43.691
(singing in foreign language)

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:01.608
(dramatic music)

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:40.358
(dramatic music)

01:59:40.358 --> 01:59:45.983
(singing in foreign language)

01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:01.608
(dramatic music)

02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:35.900
(singing in foreign language)

02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:44.941
(dramatic music)

02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:01.608
(dramatic music)

02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.608
(dramatic music)

02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:01.608
(dramatic music)

02:03:28.858 --> 02:03:31.608
(dramatic music)

02:03:58.900 --> 02:04:01.608
(dramatic music)

02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:31.608
(dramatic music)

02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:01.608
(dramatic music)

02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:31.608
(dramatic music)

02:05:58.900 --> 02:06:01.608
(dramatic music)

02:06:28.858 --> 02:06:31.608
(dramatic music)

02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:01.066
(dramatic music)
