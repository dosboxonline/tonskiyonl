just criminals.

Good, because I'm not
having a kid with a killer.

Oh. So it's guilt

Look, Father, in the last day

I've had more people try
to kill me than I can count,

I'm gonna be a father.

(SIGHS) Um...

01:27:27.735 --> 01:27:30.174
There was a chief
of a Corsican crime syndicate.

01:27:30.174 --> 01:27:32.438
That was one shot
over a mile out.

01:27:32.438 --> 01:27:33.872
A Romanian arms dealer.

01:27:33.872 --> 01:27:37.148
Uh, did him
at close range with a pistol.

01:27:37.148 --> 01:27:39.720
A rogue British agent
in Geneva.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.484
That was hand-to-hand...

01:27:41.484 --> 01:27:45.219
A Russian oligarch in Vienna,
a garrote.

01:27:45.219 --> 01:27:46.556
I mean, real quiet.

01:27:46.556 --> 01:27:49.656
In all my years as a priest,
as a human being,

01:27:49.656 --> 01:27:52.694
I have never heard
anything remotely...

01:27:52.694 --> 01:27:54.763
And last night, there was
the entire Goyang crew.

01:27:54.763 --> 01:27:58.366
They came after me,
so technically, self-defense.

01:27:58.366 --> 01:28:02.335
Murder is murder is murder.

Most of my targets
never saw it coming.

01:28:05.507 --> 01:28:08.945
Kind of a point of pride
with top hitmen.

01:28:08.945 --> 01:28:10.245
Pride is a sin.

01:28:10.245 --> 01:28:11.414
Well, kind of lightweight

01:28:11.414 --> 01:28:12.780
compared to contract killing, right?

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:16.455
I'm not sure I'm qualified
to pardon all of this.

01:28:16.455 --> 01:28:18.553
What, do you need to call
the Vatican or something?

01:28:18.553 --> 01:28:20.626
They'd tell me
to call the police.

01:28:21.793 --> 01:28:22.955

The way I see it is your boss,
the man upstairs,

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:29.231
he's given me a second chance.

01:28:29.231 --> 01:28:31.069
I'm gonna be a father,

01:28:31.069 --> 01:28:32.839
so I don't want
to mess that up.

01:28:32.839 --> 01:28:34.107
I'll give you redemption,

but no more killing,
no more murder.

01:28:36.069 --> 01:28:38.441
Well, there might be some
self-defense in the near future.

01:28:38.441 --> 01:28:41.013
Do you get this?
It's a sin. It's wrong.

01:28:41.013 --> 01:28:42.581
You asked for a confession.

01:28:42.581 --> 01:28:44.744
I wish I kept my mouth shut
if we're both being honest here.

01:28:44.744 --> 01:28:47.486
