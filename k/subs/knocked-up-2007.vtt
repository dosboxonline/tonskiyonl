WEBVTT

00:47.047 --> 00:48.464
Light your nuts on fire.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.467
Fuck! Fuck! My hands!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.553
Too hot for Jonah!

00:53.637 --> 00:56.055
I got fucking water in my mouth!

01:14.908 --> 01:16.701
Oh, my God!

01:22.916 --> 01:25.668
I got to get off! I got to get off!
Got to get off! Got to get off!

01:43.270 --> 01:45.104
Sadie, wake up!

01:45.814 --> 01:47.607
Oh, my gosh!

01:47.691 --> 01:49.484
Daddy, wake up!

01:52.404 --> 01:53.571
Okay, I'm up.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.664
Is that my genius over here?
Is that my genius?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.878
I need you to take the kids
to school this morning.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.882
- I would, but I'm supposed to work out.
- What?

02:12.966 --> 02:16.302
Yeah. I got an appointment with a trainer.
I can't cancel it now. He'll charge me.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.012
- You didn't tell me that.
- Yeah, I did.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.972
- Last week I told you.
- You didn't tell me.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.683
I did. And then I wrote it on the
calendar like you told me to.

02:22.768 --> 02:23.935
No, you didn't tell me.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.895
- I did tell you.
- Well, you didn't,

02:25.979 --> 02:28.689
but what are we gonna do,
'cause I have an appointment?

02:28.774 --> 02:31.651
So you're taking the kids to school.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.779
Don't use the baby to cover your tracks.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.114
I can drive them. I'll drive them
to school.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.450
- Thank you very much.
- Great. Good.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.410
You turned my sister into a limo driver.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.895
- I don't mind.
- It all worked out!

02:49.044 --> 02:51.546
What are you giggling about?

02:52.089 --> 02:56.259
Be quiet. You're starting to annoy me.

02:57.469 --> 03:00.012
- Poo poo.
- Ladies. Be nice.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.764
- You know what I did the other day?
- What?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.684
- I googled "murder."
- You googled "murder"?

03:04.768 --> 03:06.102
- Yeah.
- Why?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.520
I mean, what did it say?

03:07.604 --> 03:09.689
It didn't say anything.
It just showed pictures

03:09.773 --> 03:15.319
of people lying dead on the floor
and blood everywhere, and...

03:15.404 --> 03:17.613
That was just ketchup.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.157
- Who wants to hear some music?
- I want to hear Rent.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.410
I want to hear Green Day!

03:22.494 --> 03:24.036
No, we're listening to Rent!

03:24.121 --> 03:25.788
Well, I want to listen
to Green Day.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.582
I got your baby!

03:27.666 --> 03:30.084
- Don't taunt her. Come on.
- Here.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.504
Sadie! Why did you just do that?
Don't throw things at your sister!

03:33.589 --> 03:34.797
She hit me.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.133
- Did you hit her?
- I did not.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.051
Make her happy. It's okay.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.970
- It won't make her happy.
- It's okay. It's okay.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.471
She spilled all the marbles on the floor.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.796
Well, give her her marble back.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.976
All right? Are you sure you understand
the terms of the bet?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.145
- Because this is serious.
- No.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.397
Martin, all right, listen.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.901
You don't shave your beard
or cut your hair for one year,

03:54.985 --> 03:57.153
and if you can do that,
I will pay your rent.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.990
But if you shave, then you have to pay
all five of our rents.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.436
Thanks for the free money, bitch.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.660
Hey, Martin, was it weird
when you joined the Taliban,

04:04.786 --> 04:06.495
being American and everything like that?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.831
Like when you see a woman driving
a car, do you just get pissed?

04:08.916 --> 04:11.556
Just watch your back, Serpico.
You never know who your friends are.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.942
Okay, all right. You guys can't make
fun of me the whole time.

04:15.005 --> 04:18.089
But, Martin, it's a competition.
It's called, "The Dirty Man Competition."

04:18.175 --> 04:20.009
We're gonna make fun of you
until you shave the beard.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.260
- That's the rules.
- That's the whole point.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.845
You're supposed to be tempted into shaving.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.771
Your face looks like Robin
Williams' knuckles.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.517
You guys aren't allowed to make fun
of me. It's not part of the rules.

04:28.644 --> 04:31.524
Martin, why didn't you just listen to
me when I was explaining the rules?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.856
You just looked at me with that
blank stare of yours.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.525
It was like talking
to a wax statue.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.946
Okay, guys, are you ready?

04:40.030 --> 04:45.117
So, "Only at fleshofthestars.com will
customers be able to find"

04:45.202 --> 04:50.289
"exactly how long into what movies their
favorite stars are exposed."

04:50.374 --> 04:51.791
- Nice.
- Oh, fucking brilliant.

04:51.875 --> 04:52.959
Pretty good, right?

04:53.043 --> 04:54.627
- Yeah. Yeah, ka-ching.
- We're in.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.545
All right, guys,
let start logging, all right?

04:56.672 --> 04:58.472
Charles Manson? Do you have
any other thoughts?

04:58.507 --> 05:00.387
Good, awesome, let's start this off
with a bang.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.970
Jamie Lee Curtis. I got an hour and
10 minutes into Trading Places.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.888
Both chesticles.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.560
I got Julianne "Red Beard" Moore.

05:11.687 --> 05:15.815
Short Cuts, two hours,
17 minutes, bush no boobs.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.499
- Julianne Moore special.
- She loves it.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.567
I've seen that,

05:18.694 --> 05:21.821
and from the look of her bush, Short Cuts
is the wrong name for that movie.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.990
- Nice.
- Nice. Nice. Well done.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.993
Her bush looks like the hedge maze
from The Shining but red

05:27.077 --> 05:28.995
and without Scatman Crothers in it.

05:31.248 --> 05:35.751
Red Bush.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.922
So if you want that perfect tan
like the stars, he's the one to see.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.258
We'll be right back on E! News.
Stay with us.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.094
Okay. Okay, is Jessica Simpson
here yet?

05:45.178 --> 05:47.221
Let me check. Let me see.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.724
- Is she on her way? She's left her house?
- Hey, guys?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.100
Okay, let me know when she's pulling in.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.768
- She's about to pull in.
- Is she camera-ready?

05:52.853 --> 05:53.978
Is she camera-ready?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.939
If she's gonna be in hair and makeup
for three hours, I can't do it.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.983
I'm not gonna be here.
I got to do American Idol.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.485
It's live. I got to do it.
I got to be there.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.612
- What are we gonna interview her about?
- Nothing personal.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.457
- No personal questions.
- No personal questions.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.074
Don't ask her about her sister
and her nose job.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.492
- No plastic surgery questions.
- No plastic...

06:08.577 --> 06:09.660
No personal questions.

06:09.745 --> 06:13.456
She doesn't want to talk about her boobs
or her father's comments about her boobs.

06:13.540 --> 06:17.460
Great. We'll talk about the Middle East
and maybe an idea of an exit strategy.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.669
Maybe she has a good pitch.

06:18.754 --> 06:20.296
Should I ask her about Korea?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.174
Maybe have her point it
out to us on a globe?

06:23.258 --> 06:25.634
I don't understand
the young talent in this town!

06:25.719 --> 06:28.471
It doesn't make any sense.
I got four jobs.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.765
Hell, I'm more famous than half the people
we talk to, anyway!

06:30.891 --> 06:31.932
No one stands up.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.100
No one has the balls
to sit them down

06:33.226 --> 06:34.393
and say, "Look, just cut the shit."

06:34.478 --> 06:35.638
But everybody works for them.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.688
They're all on the payroll.
They're all sucking the teat!

06:37.773 --> 06:42.026
Nobody sits them down, eye-to-eye,
one-on-one, and says, "Cut the shit."

06:42.110 --> 06:43.652
And all these stars
just fuck it up.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.780
That's what they do.
They fuck my day up!

06:45.906 --> 06:47.448
And it pisses me off.
And now I'm sweating.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.033
Okay, you want to...
You know what?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.868
You want us to just come and get you
when she gets here?

06:50.952 --> 06:52.453
You want to head to
the green room for a minute?

06:52.579 --> 06:54.163
- Just chill out? Okay.
- Yeah. That's a good idea.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.748
Want us to bring you anything?
You want some water?

06:55.832 --> 06:57.666
- You want a cookie?
- Cookie, yeah, cookie. Thanks.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.710
- Okay, we'll get you a cookie.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm pissed.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.212
What do we got?
Chocolate chip?

07:01.296 --> 07:02.421
- Allison?
- Yeah.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.131
Jack and I need
to see you in his office.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.299
Okay.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.011
Thanks for coming in, Allison.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.930
Well, we wanted
to talk to you today

07:11.014 --> 07:16.227
because we had a little debate on the
conference call with New York about you.

07:16.311 --> 07:19.480
You... About me?
You were talking about me?

07:19.940 --> 07:23.067
We were wondering
aloud to one another

07:23.151 --> 07:26.070
whether or not you would
be good for on camera.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.947
What'd you decide?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.951
They... They decided
that they like you,

07:32.035 --> 07:36.372
and they would like
to put you on camera.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.458
- Really?
- I know. I was so surprised, too.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.169
Oh, my God. This is the best news ever.
Thank you so much.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.797
- This is great!
- Congratulations.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.633
Thank you. I'll take that smile
as a "Yes, I'll do it."

07:47.717 --> 07:49.969
Absolutely. I'm so excited!
Oh, my God.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.429
It's a lot of work. Can't wait
to see what happens.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.849
It's gonna be tough.
Tough job.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.725
About the work,
most immediately,

07:56.810 --> 07:59.019
there's gonna be some things that you're
gonna be able to get...

07:59.146 --> 08:01.397
- Okay.
- ...that other people in the office don't get.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.357
One of them, gym membership.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.650
You want me to lose weight?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.361
No, I don't
want you to lose weight.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.822
No. We can't legally
ask you to do that.

08:09.906 --> 08:13.242
We didn't say lose weight.
I might say tighten.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.451
Tight.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.580
A little tighter?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.582
Just like toned and smaller.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.377
Don't make everything smaller. I don't
want to generalize that way.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.628
Tighter.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.233
We don't want you to lose weight. We just
want you to be healthy.

08:27.257 --> 08:30.342
- Okay.
- You know, by eating less.

08:30.427 --> 08:34.471
We would just like it if you go home
and step on the scale

08:34.556 --> 08:37.975
and write down how much you weigh
and subtract it by, like, 20.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.895
- Twenty.
- And then weigh that much.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.648
Just remember, you've got it here,
you've got it here

08:44.733 --> 08:47.860
and everybody's gonna
see you right there.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.280
Yay! That's so exciting!
Oh, my God!

08:52.449 --> 08:53.449
Hey!

08:53.533 --> 08:54.617
Huh?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.076
I got a promotion.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.745
- Oh, congratulations!
- Thank you.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.246
Hey, maybe you can
get your own place now.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.123
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.708
- Yay!
- Let's go celebrate.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.460
Okay. Let's do it.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.253
- Pete'll watch the kids?
- Yeah!

09:06.379 --> 09:08.172
We can watch
Taxicab Confessions.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.840
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know!

09:11.551 --> 09:12.885
I'm so excited!

09:14.304 --> 09:16.138
I walked in on him
masturbating one night.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.390
Did he get the
deer-in-the-headlights look?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.601
Did he freeze or did he finish?

09:20.727 --> 09:24.688
No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't
doing anything under the covers.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.776
Oh, no!

09:28.902 --> 09:32.071
I buy these nice towels,
and he whacks off into them.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.365
- Deb and Pete, forever.
- And...

09:34.449 --> 09:38.244
And once he does that into them once,
they're never soft ever again.

09:41.248 --> 09:45.251
I can always tell if I'm looking good based
on whether or not we get in.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.962
- Ladies?
- Guess we're looking good.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.339
- If I didn't get in, I would've lost my shit.
- What's going on, man?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.299
How long you gonna make us wait out here,
for Christ's sake?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.509
What the fuck?

09:58.431 --> 10:01.475
You know what movie I just saw again
the other day, which is fucking, like,

10:01.601 --> 10:04.121
mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it
since it came out is Munich.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.521
Oh, Munich!

10:05.605 --> 10:08.065
- Oh, man, Munich fucking rules.
- Munich is awesome!

10:08.149 --> 10:11.318
That movie was Eric Bana
kicking fucking ass!

10:11.444 --> 10:13.612
Dude, every movie with Jews,
we're the ones getting killed.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.156
Munich flips it on its ear.
We're capping motherfuckers.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.992
Not only killing but fucking,
like, taking names.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.828
If any of us get laid tonight, it's because
of Eric Bana in Munich.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.996
I agree with that.
I agree.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.682
You know what is not
helping us get laid

10:23.790 --> 10:26.542
is the shoe bomber, Richard Reid,
over here at our table.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.753
- I don't like your shoes.
- How was Burning Man this year?

10:29.838 --> 10:32.172
Fuck you guys.
I'm glad I'm not Jewish.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.383
- So are we.
- Yeah, so are we.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.510
Yeah. Fine, screw it.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.887
- You weren't chosen for a reason.
- Yeah.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.143
It's like everyone
in here is 12 years old.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.064
- Am I too old to be here?
- What?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.233
- Am I too old to be here?
- No, of course not.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.818
Does it look weird
that I'm here?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.111
No, not at all.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.904
Am I hotter than
these little bitches?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.906
Yes! You look amazing.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.242
- Guys in here would fuck me, right?
- Yes.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.037
That's weird to say,
but it makes me feel better.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.496
You look hot.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.081
Okay. I believe you.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.042
- Okay. I'm getting us drinks.
- Okay.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.918
Yo, a beer over here, please?

11:10.003 --> 11:13.547
You're gonna be embarrassed when you
realize I'm Wilmer Valderrama.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.757
God.

11:17.052 --> 11:19.553
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

11:19.554 --> 11:21.638
He's literally ignoring this entire
half of the bar.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.724
Don't even bother.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.809
Yeah, awesome.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.978
A beer over here, please?

11:28.104 --> 11:30.773
- He looked at us! Did you see that?
- Yeah, that was rough.

11:30.857 --> 11:34.151
Oh, my God. And if you can't get service,
what am I gonna do, you know?

11:34.235 --> 11:36.362
Great. It's gonna be that night.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.864
- Okay, you want a beer?
- Yeah, just...

11:38.948 --> 11:41.116
Well, I'm... Watch this.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.868
Okay? Just observe.

11:44.746 --> 11:45.946
- There you go.
- Come on, man.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.374
Here you go. For your trouble.
Thank you. There you go.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.750
- Thank you.
- Okay, enjoy it.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.126
- Are you sure?
- I am sure.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.463
I tried that once before at the Comedy
Store, and I got punched in the ear.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.798
Thanks a lot.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.384
Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm supposed
to get one for my sister.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.470
- Oh, here, take mine.
- No, that's okay. I'll wait.

12:01.554 --> 12:06.600
Please, I very rarely look cool. This is
a big moment for me. Just take it.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.143
- Thank you. Awesome.
- No problem.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.062
- I'm Allison.
- I'm Ben.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.192
- Well, have a great night.
- Yeah, you, too.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.027
- Thanks for the beer.
- Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.406
- Bye. Thanks again.
- I'll see you. No, I'll see you later.

12:20.490 --> 12:25.577
No, I won't 'cause I'm a pussy.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.954
What's up, Ben?

12:27.038 --> 12:30.916
That girl. She totally gave me an
opening, man, and I locked up.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.001
I just want to get shit-faced tonight,
though, you know.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.837
I'll just jerk it later. It's cool.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.924
- Are you fucking crazy, man?
- She looks smart.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.385
- Who's that she's sitting with?
- It's her sister.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.594
- Her sister?
- Yeah.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.013
Dude, it's the dream. What are we doing
standing here, man?

12:45.098 --> 12:47.141
Let's go. Come on, follow me.
You stay here. Stay here.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.893
- Why?
- Because your face looks like a vagina.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.603
Dick!

12:51.688 --> 12:53.981
Hey, which one's the sister?

12:55.817 --> 12:59.027
Hey, Crockett, you still partying
with Tubbs these days?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.697
Come on, man. I'm getting
it from all angles here.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.861
- I don't like it anymore.
- I know. I don't, either.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.910
Was it weird when you changed your name
from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.287
Yeah, it was really awkward.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.330
All right, man. I got to take off.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.207
See you, Scorsese-on-coke.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.503
What's that?

13:16.588 --> 13:18.172
Chewbacca. You know, it's Chewie.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.257
- Oh, another beard joke.
- Fuck.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.884
Fucking hilarious!

13:23.803 --> 13:24.928
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.264
Hi, this is my friend, Jason.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.100
I just wanted to see
how my beers were doing.

13:30.852 --> 13:31.935
This is my sister, Debbie.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.061
Oh, hi, I'm Ben.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.605
- Hi. Ben?
- Yes.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.856
Nice to meet you.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.108
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.568
Just trying not to stare.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.777
She's married.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.237
Why do you have to say that?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.156
- What?
- It's a shame.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.407
You're beautiful.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.491
Thank you.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.243
She has two kids, too.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.453
Shut up!

13:49.537 --> 13:50.787
What? It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.497
You think that's gonna stop him
from hitting on her?

13:52.582 --> 13:54.124
It's not at all.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.792
I love kids.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.044
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.088
Excuse me.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.050
- Hello?
- Cool phone.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.593
Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.512
What? Is it a rash,
or is it the chicken pox?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.182
I don't know! Google it.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.768
Okay. All right, bye.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.063
I got to go. Sadie might
have the chicken pox.

14:16.147 --> 14:19.608
I had the chicken pox three times.
I have no immunity to it.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.693
We don't have the heart
to tell him it's herpes.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.612
It's not herpes
if it's everywhere.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.280
Are you coming?

14:28.493 --> 14:31.453
You know, I'm all dressed,
so I'll just hang out.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.747
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll take a cab home.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.627
Okay. Be safe.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.046
I will. Yeah.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.881
- Bye, lovely.
- Bye.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.220
All right, I'm gonna let you
two get to know each other.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.975
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.393
To you.

14:56.854 --> 15:00.107
No, no. You know, the, like,
Entertainment News channel?

15:00.191 --> 15:01.525
- E!
- E!

15:04.237 --> 15:07.447
Dude, I think he's doing
the dice thing too much.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.242
That's really all he's got.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.747
I love your curly hair!
It's so great.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.082
Do you, like,
use a product or anything?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.543
No, that's...
I use Jew, it's called.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.047
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah, let's go.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.300
You wanna come back
and hang out at my place?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.634
Yes.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.845
- Yeah. Wicked.
- I'll show you my audition tape.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.389
- It's really funny.
- Okay, I'm really excited to watch that.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.682
Let's go.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.603
We could get a cab up,
this way. For sure.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.440
This is a big yard.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.402
Let's go swimming right now.
Let's just do that.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.951
- I know. It feels so right.
- That's right.

15:53.036 --> 15:57.873
Oh, man. Oh, man.
You're prettier than I am.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.374
A lot.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.843
- Do you have a condom?
- I do.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.179
- Okay.
- In my pants. I have a condom.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.014
Okay. Okay.
I'll get it.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.733
Come on.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.779
- Hurry up.
- Stupid fucker.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.075
- What are you doing?
- I almost got it. Just give me a second.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.452
Oh, God, just do it already!

16:35.536 --> 16:38.830
- Okay.
- Oh, great. Okay.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.093
God.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.638
- Oh, that's great!
- Good thing I'm drunk.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.765
- This is lasting forever.
- Yeah, it's awesome.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.600
I just doubled my record time.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.185
Oh, yeah. You did.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.771
- I'm sorry, I'm sweating on you.
- Okay, just stop talking.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.207
Fuck off, Martin.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.377
I said, fuck off, Martin.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.049
Hi.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.677
Oh. Hey.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.220
Hey.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.057
I'm naked.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.142
Yeah.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.853
Did we have sex?

17:42.937 --> 17:43.979
Yes.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.064
Nice.

17:50.903 --> 17:51.945
What time is it?

17:52.029 --> 17:53.029
7:30.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.407
Why the fuck are we awake?
Let's go back to sleep.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.783
I have to go to work.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.285
Really?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.996
Do you need to get
to work or anything?

18:01.080 --> 18:04.040
No, I'm... No work today.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.423
Do you wanna get breakfast?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.591
Okay.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.729
Morning.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.439
Good morning, Allison.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.566
I'm Ben. What's happening, man?

18:29.942 --> 18:30.984
Ben.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.194
How's it going?

18:32.278 --> 18:33.361
Ah, to be young.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.446
Stop it.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.907
You stop it.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.034
Okay, see you later.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.494
All righty.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.121
See you later. Enjoy the day.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.124
Never do what they did.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.876
I'm gonna do it.

18:47.960 --> 18:52.214
You are? Uh-oh. Someone's
getting home-schooled.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.514
I just yacked something nasty.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.975
I feel way better, though. I think that's
like the secret. Like you gotta...

19:04.060 --> 19:07.562
I mean, once you're hung-over,
you just gotta puke.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.772
It feels so... Did you puke?

19:08.856 --> 19:10.023
No.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.691
You can. I won't think
it's gross or anything.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.610
Oh, that's okay, I'm fine.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.153
- Okay.
- I just need some coffee, so...

19:15.238 --> 19:16.655
You know, the best thing
for a hangover is weed.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.741
- Do you smoke... Do you smoke weed?
- Not really.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.950
- You don't?
- No.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.409
- At all?
- Mmm-mmm.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.537
Like in the morning?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.747
No, I just don't.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.000
You know, it's like...
It is like the best medicine.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.794
Because it fixes everything.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.420
Jonah broke his elbow once.

19:32.505 --> 19:37.676
He just got high, and it still clicks,
but, I mean, he's okay.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.261
- Right.
- Yeah.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.056
Last night was great,
what I remember of it.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.516
Right, yeah.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.309
Yeah, no, it was fun.
We had a great time.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.769
Yeah.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.271
So what do you do?

19:49.355 --> 19:50.605
I work at E!

19:50.690 --> 19:52.566
- The television channel?
- Uh-huh.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.775
- Remember?
- Wow!

19:53.859 --> 19:55.259
We had this conversation last night.

19:55.278 --> 19:58.863
I told you about my promotion.
I was out celebrating it.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.533
- No?
- No.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.034
I don't remember that at all.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.411
Yeah. I'm super
excited about it.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.871
I'm actually doing my first
on-air interview today, so...

20:06.956 --> 20:08.665
- With who?
- Matthew Fox.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.041
- Matthew Fox from Lost?
- Yeah.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.543
- You know what's interesting about him?
- What?

20:11.627 --> 20:12.919
- Nothing.
- What?

20:13.004 --> 20:14.754
- Will you tell him he's an asshole for me?
- No.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.840
Someone needs to.
Like who gives a shit?

20:16.924 --> 20:20.093
Well, I hope a lot of people, actually,
because that's what my job entails

20:20.177 --> 20:22.345
is making sure people care
what he has to say.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.180
I'm interviewing him.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.890
Maybe it's just me. Maybe
I just don't give a shit.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.393
I'm just saying
he deserves a beat-down.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.717
Actually, it's sort of embarrassing
to ask at this point,

20:30.730 --> 20:32.772
but what do you do for work?

20:32.857 --> 20:36.234
Me and my roommates have started a...
We're starting an Internet website.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.944
Oh, cool. What is it?

20:38.029 --> 20:40.739
I'll give you the virtual
experience, okay? How's that?

20:40.823 --> 20:42.115
- You're at your computer.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.700
Who's an actress you like?

20:43.784 --> 20:46.202
- Mary Tyler Moore?
- No.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.454
- That does not work at all.
- No?

20:47.538 --> 20:48.747
- No.
- Okay.

20:48.831 --> 20:52.500
- Let's say you love Meg Ryan.
- I do.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.918
- Great. Who doesn't?
- Yeah.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.462
Let's say you like her so much

20:55.546 --> 20:59.299
you wanna know every movie
where she shows her tits.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.927
And not just that, but how long into that
movie she shows her tits.

21:03.012 --> 21:07.474
You come to our web page exclusively.
Type in "Meg Ryan." Bam!

21:07.558 --> 21:12.395
In the Cut, 38 minutes in, 48 minutes in,
like an hour and 10 minutes...

21:12.480 --> 21:14.105
She's, like, naked that whole
fucking movie.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.232
- She does full frontal in that movie.
- Wow.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.526
- They should've called her Harry, not Sally.
- Really.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.779
I'll show it to you.
I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush.

21:20.863 --> 21:21.988
- Okay.
- Cool.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.115
Yeah, I actually need
to get going, so...

21:24.200 --> 21:28.828
Well, could... Can I get your number?
I mean, I don't...

21:28.913 --> 21:32.332
We had fun, right?
We should hook up again.

21:32.416 --> 21:36.795
I'm gonna give you my card 'cause
that'll be the best way to...

21:36.879 --> 21:41.007
Well, I mean, if you want to contact me,
I don't have a cell, right now,

21:41.092 --> 21:43.677
because of payment complications.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.054
But, I mean, you can e-mail me
at the web page. I check...

21:46.138 --> 21:50.100
It's just Ben at flesh-of-the-stars,
one word, dot-com.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.518
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.478
- Okay.
- So, awesome.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.730
All right, then.
Nice to meet you.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.733
- Yeah. Okay.
- Bye. Take care.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.194
See you.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.863
Bye!

22:04.949 --> 22:06.658
That was fucking brutal.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.786
Yeah, that was brutal.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.414
- It was a huge mistake.
- What's a mistake?

22:15.501 --> 22:18.962
Nothing. Nothing that we need
to talk about right now.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.714
Why did you do it?

22:22.174 --> 22:26.177
Aunty Allison drank
too much chocolate milk.

22:26.262 --> 22:30.056
And I was feeling weird because of that.
And I made a...

22:30.141 --> 22:31.381
- I think that's enough.
- Okay.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.602
- Did he wear a condom?
- Yes.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.937
Thank God.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.942
- Do you think you'll do it again?
- No, no way.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.319
She was totally repulsed by me.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.697
- What?
- She just really didn't seem to like me.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.283
Like, she wasn't laughing at my jokes.
I mean, I'm like a funny guy.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.326
- Fucking funny as balls.
- Hilarious, man.

22:50.411 --> 22:53.580
I'm giving her the A shit. Nothing.
She thought our web page was a bad idea.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.665
- What?
- That fucking stuck-up bitch.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.000
Yeah, I think so, too.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.924
I think it's awesome
that you had sex with her.

22:59.003 --> 23:02.922
If a goofy guy like you had sex with her,
I feel like I had sex with her also.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.966
I was so drunk. I just wish I
remembered it.

23:12.057 --> 23:16.436
Hi, I'm Allison Scott. And we're here today
with James Franco from Spider-Man.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.687
- How are you?
- Great, great.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.052
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.941
Tell me, were you
a big fan of the...

23:22.067 --> 23:24.194
- I'm sorry, let me take that again.
- Okay.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.863
Tell me, were you a big fan
of the comic books growing up?

23:26.947 --> 23:28.865
No, actually,

23:28.949 --> 23:32.577
I didn't read any of the comic books until
I got the movie and then...

23:34.705 --> 23:35.830
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.416
Yeah, just what about
the comic books?

23:38.501 --> 23:40.460
Just keep talking.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.713
Like I said,
I really wasn't into them,

23:43.798 --> 23:47.175
but now that I did the research, I think
they're pretty amazing, like...

23:50.304 --> 23:51.471
Shit.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.891
What the fuck?

23:59.730 --> 24:01.856
Is that the sound of you puking?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.818
<i>If this is one of those fucking joke shows,
I'm not into it.</i>

24:04.902 --> 24:06.861
We should put this on YouTube.
Shut up.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.655
- This is hilarious.
- You're an asshole.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.739
Look how sweaty you are.
You look like Dom DeLuise.

24:10.741 --> 24:12.784
I don't need to see it again.
It's gonna make me throw up.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.119
You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.458
You're such an asshole.

24:20.543 --> 24:21.960
I'm just jerking your chain.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.378
I'll fix this. No problem.

24:23.462 --> 24:27.131
Yeah, maybe if you can just
edit this out, and we can...

24:28.425 --> 24:30.385
We can reshoot my questions.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.389
What's up?

24:35.224 --> 24:37.517
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Over here.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.603
Not on the mix board,
not on the mix board, here.

24:44.608 --> 24:45.942
Are you okay?

24:46.026 --> 24:50.738
Oh, my God.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.866
- Are you sick?
- I don't know.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.451
- What'd you eat?
- I haven't eaten today yet.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.537
- You haven't...
- Do you have, like, a napkin or something?

24:57.621 --> 24:59.080
Here, here.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.417
What, do you have,
like, the flu?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.918
I don't know.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.421
God, I hope you're not pregnant.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.966
It's impossible. You have
to have sex to get pregnant.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.305
B. K. It's Brent Master Five.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.974
Allison just puked.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.435
Dude, that's what I said. She's
probably pregnant, right?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.645
- Oh, shit.
- How does she look right now?

25:22.771 --> 25:25.523
She looks like she just realized
that she's pregnant.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.775
No, I can't be
pregnant. Right?

25:27.860 --> 25:30.486
I mean that was, what?

25:30.613 --> 25:32.333
- Eight weeks ago? When was that?
- Mmm-hmm.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.240
Did you miss your period?

25:34.325 --> 25:35.742
No. Wait.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.536
I don't know. Shit. I don't know.
I can't remember.

25:38.621 --> 25:40.622
I was... I mean, I've been
really stressed at work.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.248
I can't remember my last period.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.167
Are you the lady who doesn't
realize she's pregnant

25:44.293 --> 25:46.333
till she's sitting on the toilet
and a kid pops out?

25:46.420 --> 25:48.004
Can you not joke right now?
Don't joke right now.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.006
- This is really serious.
- Did I meet him?

25:50.132 --> 25:52.467
Yeah. You know, he was
kind of like medium height,

25:52.593 --> 25:56.012
sort of chubby.
Blonde, curly hair. Remember?

25:56.138 --> 25:57.847
- With the man-boobs.
- Yes.

25:57.973 --> 26:01.225
Here, I have this thing of him on my phone.
I just watched it.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.728
<i>Hey! I live in your phone!</i>

26:03.812 --> 26:05.146
Oh.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.733
<i>This is the best night of my life.</i>

26:08.817 --> 26:10.777
<i>I gotta pee.</i>

26:10.861 --> 26:12.487
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.949
- How did this happen?
- Oh, shit.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.992
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.082
They're here!
Here they are! Over here!

26:24.166 --> 26:25.375
Oh, no.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.251
- Okay, here we are.
- Okay.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.629
- Okay. All right.
- Here.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.850
Oh, no. Give me more!
Give me a few more!

26:42.977 --> 26:44.686
Did you try the Ova-Sure?

26:45.896 --> 26:48.189
I'm dripping,
I'm dripping. Wait.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.650
Oh, good! A smiley face!

26:51.485 --> 26:52.944
Oh, I think that's bad.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.321
How long does this one take?

26:55.823 --> 26:58.408
These can't all be positive.
Let me try one.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.207
God, you really had to pee.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.421
What is this?
What the hell is this?

27:12.214 --> 27:14.298
I think you picked up
the wrong one.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.675
Oh, fuck.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.386
That scared me.

27:18.512 --> 27:21.055
That would suck. I'm sorry.

27:23.559 --> 27:24.892
That scared me.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.854
It's gonna be fine. Right?

27:29.606 --> 27:30.606
Right?

27:30.691 --> 27:33.484
Of course it will be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

27:33.569 --> 27:34.986
You just need to call him.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.530
Maybe I don't need to call him
until after I see the doctor.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.032
- You need to call.
- I don't want to call him.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.756
- I don't need to call him.
- You should call.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.161
I can't call him anyway.
He doesn't even have a phone.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.662
He didn't even have
a number to give me.

27:44.747 --> 27:45.788
He doesn't have a phone?

27:45.873 --> 27:47.498
Said he had some
kind of billing issue.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.501
He can't afford a phone?
Sadie has a phone.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.004
Oh, shit, you're right.
I got to call.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.548
I don't know. I'm gonna have to look
him up on his stupid website.

27:55.632 --> 27:56.952
What kind of website
does he have?

27:58.260 --> 28:01.012
He spelled "coming" wrong.
Oh, it's cum...

28:01.096 --> 28:03.222
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's gross.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.266
Just go to "Contact Us."

28:06.602 --> 28:07.852
- Ben?
- Yeah.

28:09.646 --> 28:13.024
"What is your number? I need to speak
with you right away."

28:13.108 --> 28:14.525
- Send?
- Yep.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.152
You're sure?

28:16.236 --> 28:17.487
Yeah.

28:19.782 --> 28:21.783
I love weed.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.951
I could smoke weed
every second of every day.

28:24.078 --> 28:27.121
Jay, I am your stoner.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.673
- Hey, Benjamin?
- Yeah.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.051
- Flesh of the Stars just got an e-mail.
- Really?

28:40.135 --> 28:42.595
- Would you like me to read it to you?
- Yeah, sure.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.972
"Ben, what is your number?"

28:45.099 --> 28:48.518
"I need to speak to you right away.
Allison Scott."

28:48.644 --> 28:51.646
Oh! Shit!

28:52.106 --> 28:53.940
Someone wants seconds, mama!

28:54.024 --> 28:55.274
Oh, man!

28:55.359 --> 28:57.819
"Looking forward to speaking with you."

28:57.945 --> 29:01.864
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do one of those
smiley faces at the end.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.491
- Fucking-A. Those are sexy.
- Sent.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.917
Somebody wants another piece!

29:14.169 --> 29:15.211
Booty-booty call.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.004
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi.

29:17.131 --> 29:21.217
Hey, Ben, this is... This is Allison.
I don't know if you remember me.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.886
Oh, yeah, Allison. What's up?

29:24.012 --> 29:26.430
She like the way
your dick tastes.

29:26.515 --> 29:30.726
Yeah, I actually was
just wondering if maybe you

29:30.853 --> 29:33.062
wanted to get together,
like tomorrow night?

29:33.188 --> 29:35.668
I've been meaning to call you so we could,
like, hook up again.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.483
- You know what I'm saying?
- Okay, cool.

29:37.568 --> 29:40.361
Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night?
You wanna just grab some dinner?

29:40.487 --> 29:44.157
<i>Yeah. Why not? Meeting of minds
sounds good.</i>

29:44.241 --> 29:48.035
<i>What do you say Geisha House,
Hollywood, 9:00?</i>

29:48.162 --> 29:49.328
Sure, sure. That's cool.

29:49.413 --> 29:51.747
Can we make it more like 6:00, though?
I'd like to keep it early.

29:51.874 --> 29:55.668
6:00. Beat the rush. Yeah, leaves
more time for afterwards.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.295
<i>Dessert. Sweet.</i>

29:58.088 --> 29:59.630
Okay, great.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.508
So, yeah. I'll just meet
you there, then, at 6:00.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.552
Yeah. I'll see you there.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.471
Okay, take care. Peace.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.726
Oh, shit.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.521
I'm gonna get laid,
motherfucker!

30:16.732 --> 30:18.441
Yes! Yes!

30:20.152 --> 30:22.320
- Nice place, huh?
- Yeah, it's really nice.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.656
Sorry it took so long to get a table. I
didn't realize you needed a reservation.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.074
Oh, no, that's okay.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.451
- So how's work?
- Great.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.660
- How's E!?
- Great.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.385
That's awesome. Do you know Vince Vaughn?

30:31.413 --> 30:32.622
- Have you ever met him?
- No.

30:32.748 --> 30:36.167
I really feel like we'd get along well.
I just... He seems like a fun guy.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.169
- I feel like we'd, like, hang together well.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.253
I feel like he'd like me.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.338
I'm sure a lot of guys are like, "Oh, I'd
like to hang out with that celeb",

30:42.424 --> 30:45.424
but I really think he would want to
hang out with me, is like the cool thing.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.261
I'm sure he would. Yeah.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.638
- You look very pretty, though.
- Thanks.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.124
- By the way.
- Yeah, I just thought...

30:50.140 --> 30:51.474
I don't know, I thought
maybe it'd be cool

30:51.600 --> 30:52.683
to hang out a little bit and...

30:52.768 --> 30:54.894
We didn't really get to talk that much
last time, so I thought...

30:54.978 --> 30:56.437
That we didn't.

30:58.106 --> 31:01.442
I thought maybe we'd just talk
and get to know each other better.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.486
Cool. Okay.

31:03.612 --> 31:07.073
- I'll start. I'm Canadian.
- Oh, that's cool.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.992
From Vancouver. I live
here illegally, actually.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.160
Don't tell anyone.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.121
But it works out in my advantage,
I think, ultimately,

31:14.206 --> 31:16.207
'cause I don't have to pay any taxes.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.585
So financially that's helpful

31:19.670 --> 31:22.213
'cause I don't have
a lot of money.

31:22.297 --> 31:26.425
You know, I mean, I'm not poor or anything,
but I eat a lot of spaghetti.

31:26.510 --> 31:30.805
So, you know, the web page or whatever
is just something that you guys do for fun?

31:30.889 --> 31:32.181
Do you have a real job?

31:32.307 --> 31:33.849
- Well, that is our job.
- Oh.

31:33.976 --> 31:37.061
We don't technically get money
for the hours we put in,

31:37.145 --> 31:38.562
but it is our job.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.481
- So, how do you... Right.
- How do I pay rent and shit?

31:40.565 --> 31:42.692
When I was in high school, I got ran over
by a postal truck.

31:42.818 --> 31:43.978
- Oh, my God.
- It just kind of...

31:44.027 --> 31:45.695
It was my foot
more than anything.

31:45.821 --> 31:49.824
But I got like 14 grand from
the British Columbia government.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.534
- Right.
- And that really lasted me.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.952
I mean, until now.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.204
It's been almost 10 years.
I have like 900 bucks left.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.040
So that should last me for, like, I mean,
I'm not a mathematician,

31:58.166 --> 32:00.543
but like another two years or
some shit. I think.

32:00.669 --> 32:01.711
Yeah.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.754
So I have something
I really need to tell you.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.507
It's kind of why I called you.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.551
Here goes. Um...

32:09.177 --> 32:10.469
I'm pregnant.

32:10.554 --> 32:12.096
- Fuck off.
- What?

32:12.180 --> 32:14.015
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.350
With emotion?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.853
With a baby. You're the father.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.689
- I'm the father?
- Yes.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.232
- How the fuck could this happen?
- I don't know.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.317
I don't know. I mean, I thought you were
wearing a condom.

32:25.402 --> 32:26.527
- No.
- What?

32:26.611 --> 32:28.070
- I wasn't.
- Why not?

32:28.196 --> 32:29.405
Because you told me not to.

32:29.531 --> 32:30.906
What are you talking about?

32:31.033 --> 32:32.825
What am I talking about?
You told me not to.

32:32.909 --> 32:35.369
I did not tell you
not to wear a condom.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.579
Here's what happened, okay?

32:36.663 --> 32:39.123
I will give you a play-by-play
of my memory.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.875
I almost had the condom on my dick.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.045
It was on the cusp, and then you said,
"Just do it, already."

32:44.129 --> 32:45.463
I didn't mean do it
without a condom.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.298
I meant "do it" like "hurry up,"

32:47.382 --> 32:48.507
like "Get fucking going!"

32:48.592 --> 32:51.052
Well, I assumed you were wearing a patch,
or like a dental dam

32:51.136 --> 32:53.471
or one of those fucking butterfly clips
or something like that.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.306
- What the hell is a dental dam?
- It's like Saran Wrap!

32:55.390 --> 32:57.683
It's disgusting, okay?
But I thought you had one.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.648
Why the fuck didn't you
stop me once we started?

32:59.728 --> 33:02.104
I don't know! I couldn't tell
that you didn't have one on!

33:02.230 --> 33:03.647
Obviously, I was drunk!

33:03.732 --> 33:05.024
Was your vagina drunk?

33:05.108 --> 33:07.151
Did you think it's the thinnest condom
on earth I have on?

33:07.235 --> 33:09.904
I'm a fucking inventor?
I made a dick-skin condom?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.615
He hollowed out a penis and put it on?

33:12.699 --> 33:13.908
What the fuck?

33:14.785 --> 33:16.660
You are unbelievable.

33:18.497 --> 33:24.251
Okay, you know what? Maybe
I've reacted unfavorably.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.296
So what happens now?
I don't know how this works.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.799
I am going to the doctor next week,

33:29.925 --> 33:33.052
and I thought you could come with me
to the gynecologist.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.845
- So you haven't seen him, though?
- No.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.370
So you don't know
if you're pregnant.

33:36.431 --> 33:40.267
- Well, I'm not 100% sure.
- You're not 100 % sure.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.811
I bet you're not pregnant.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.233
No, they're not.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.946
No, they're all in the bag.
They're in the bag.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.540
Allison Scott?

34:02.624 --> 34:04.166
Yeah. Come on.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.252
- I'm supposed to come?
- Yes.

34:10.422 --> 34:13.801
Hello. My name is
Thomas Pellagrino.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.136
I'm... I'm Ben Stone.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.054
Hi, there, champ.
Nice to meet you.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.806
- And you must be Debbie's sister.
- Yeah.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.056
- Alice.
- Allison. Hi.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.059
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.896
So, what can I help you with today,
Mr. and Mrs. Stone?

34:25.981 --> 34:28.357
I took a home pregnancy test,
and it said I was pregnant,

34:28.440 --> 34:30.484
so here we are.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.902
Okay. Let's have a look.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.449
Legs up.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.748
Nice office.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.083
Thank you.

34:49.795 --> 34:52.672
Well, you do look
a lot like your sister.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.597
This is gonna be cold.
And you're next.

35:09.191 --> 35:12.693
Okay, there is
the cervix and the uterus.

35:13.695 --> 35:14.945
See that?

35:15.030 --> 35:18.199
That dark sac there,
that's the amniotic sac.

35:19.034 --> 35:22.203
And right there
in the middle is the embryo.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.788
Do you see that flicker?
You know what that is?

35:24.873 --> 35:26.957
Yeah, that's a heartbeat.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.792
Yeah, it looks like
you are pregnant.

35:28.877 --> 35:31.295
About eight or nine weeks,
I'd say.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.963
Congratulations.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.593
That... That's it?

35:37.677 --> 35:38.802
Yep.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.679
Take good care of it.

35:42.224 --> 35:44.308
Now the fun part starts.

35:45.060 --> 35:48.145
Let me... Let me make
a picture for you, huh?

35:48.230 --> 35:49.730
That'll be fun.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.528
Okay. Well, I'll...
I'll meet you in my office.

35:57.614 --> 35:58.822
Okay.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.618
I'll give you
a little time alone, there.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.666
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

36:10.752 --> 36:11.919
It's okay.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.421
I can't fucking believe
you didn't wear a bag!

36:14.547 --> 36:15.631
Who does that?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.800
Why did we go to Costco and buy
a year's supply of condoms

36:17.926 --> 36:19.051
if you weren't gonna
use them, man?

36:19.135 --> 36:21.095
I can't believe you did this.
You fucked everything up.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.389
Look, the real point is not to get
yourself in this position.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.807
That's what you have to realize.

36:24.891 --> 36:25.975
You gotta know all the tricks.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.539
Like, for example, if a woman's on top,
she can't get pregnant.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.729
- It's just gravity.
- Well, that's true. Everyone knows that.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.189
What goes up must come down.

36:32.274 --> 36:35.359
I think it's awesome that
you're gonna have a kid, man.

36:35.443 --> 36:39.446
Think about it like this. It's just an
excuse to play with all your old toys again.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.031
You know what
I think you should do?

36:41.116 --> 36:43.075
Take care of it.

36:43.285 --> 36:45.494
Tell me you don't want him
to get an "A" word.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.414
Yes, I do, and I won't say it for
little Baby Ears over there,

36:48.498 --> 36:50.874
but it rhymes with "Shma-shmortion."

36:50.959 --> 36:53.210
I'm just saying... Hold on, Jay,
cover your ears.

36:53.295 --> 36:57.006
You should get a shma-shmortion
at the shma-shmortion clinic.

36:57.132 --> 37:00.509
Ben, you cannot let these monsters have
any part of your child's life.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.470
All right? I'm gonna be
there to rear your child.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.264
You hear that, Ben?
Don't let him near the kid.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.683
He wants to rear your child!

37:07.809 --> 37:09.101
I just have a quick question.

37:09.185 --> 37:12.563
Do you use that Canadian flag tattoo
as a cum target of some sort?

37:12.647 --> 37:15.774
How many points do you get if you hit
the leaf? Like a million?

37:15.859 --> 37:17.609
Jonah, I am a patriot.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.362
This is a tribute to my
country and my countrymen.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.614
I always aim right.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.616
Right into a dude's ass.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.912
Please, guys.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.165
- Ben, come on, man.
- I'm just kidding you.

37:31.291 --> 37:34.001
- Oh, great. Now he's upset.
- I won't let him do it.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.337
Allison, just take care of it.

37:36.796 --> 37:37.921
Take care of it. Move on.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.256
What's gonna happen
with your career?

37:39.341 --> 37:40.716
How are you gonna tell them?

37:40.800 --> 37:41.967
I'm not gonna tell them
for a while.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.011
I have a while
before I have to say anything.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.135
- How could you not tell them?
- They're not gonna know.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.931
I mean, I'm only gonna start
to show when I'm like,

37:48.016 --> 37:50.351
- I don't know, six months or something.
- Seven months.

37:50.435 --> 37:51.935
- Three months.
- No.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.189
Three months. Fat in the face,
jowls, fat ass.

37:56.441 --> 37:57.608
Debbie didn't get fat.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.526
Debbie is a freak of nature.

37:59.611 --> 38:03.280
Mom, you know, it's important to me
that you be supportive.

38:03.365 --> 38:07.368
I cannot be supportive of this. This is
a mistake. This is a big, big mistake.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.119
Now, think about
your stepsister.

38:09.204 --> 38:10.537
Now, you remember
what happened with her?

38:10.663 --> 38:14.291
She had the same situation as you,
and she had it taken care of.

38:14.376 --> 38:17.378
And you know what?
Now she has a real baby.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.380
Honey, this is not the time.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.715
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

38:21.841 --> 38:22.925
You happy about that?

38:23.009 --> 38:24.635
Absolutely. Delighted.

38:24.719 --> 38:25.803
This is a disaster.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.096
No, this is not a disaster.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.723
- It is...
- An earthquake is a disaster.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.809
Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad

38:31.893 --> 38:34.478
she doesn't even know who the fuck I am,
that's a disaster.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.480
This is a good thing.
This is a blessing.

38:36.564 --> 38:40.484
I have a vision
for how my life would go,

38:40.568 --> 38:42.069
and this definitely is not it.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.905
Wait. Is this your vision? Are you living
your vision right now?

38:44.989 --> 38:46.156
I am kind of living
my vision, yeah.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.075
Well, that is sad,
I'm telling you.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.577
Life doesn't care
about your vision. Okay?

38:50.703 --> 38:52.996
Stuff happens.
You just got to deal with it.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.916
You roll with it.
That's the beauty of it all.

38:56.042 --> 38:59.253
I just don't get how I tell the kid not
to do drugs when I do drugs.

38:59.379 --> 39:00.587
I'll feel like a hypocrite.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.715
Well, remember what I told you
when you were a teenager?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.759
- What did you say?
- I said, "No pills, no powders."

39:05.885 --> 39:06.965
That's right, that's right.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.430
Right. If it grows in the ground,
it's probably okay.

39:09.556 --> 39:12.766
I mean, I guess it worked. Like you told
me not to smoke pot all those years,

39:12.851 --> 39:15.853
and then I found out you were smoking pot
that whole time.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.438
Not the whole time.

39:17.564 --> 39:20.274
Just in the evenings
and all day every weekend.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.942
Not that much.

39:22.026 --> 39:27.364
Honestly, though, when you look at me
do you not think at all, like,

39:27.449 --> 39:29.032
"You know, if he just never existed,

39:29.117 --> 39:32.453
"I would have avoided a massive
heap of trouble," you know?

39:32.579 --> 39:34.204
Absolutely not.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.457
I love you totally and completely.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.876
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.544
I'm the best thing
that ever happened to you?

39:40.628 --> 39:41.795
Yeah.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.132
Now I just feel bad for you.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.975
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. Ben?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.769
Oh. Hey, Allison.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.898
- How's it going?
<i>- Good, good.</i>

40:00.982 --> 40:03.150
You know, I was just calling to...

40:04.444 --> 40:07.488
To let you know that I've
decided to keep the baby.

40:07.614 --> 40:09.114
I'm keeping it.

40:09.199 --> 40:10.407
Oh.

40:10.492 --> 40:15.162
Yeah. So, that's what's
happening with that.

40:15.288 --> 40:17.748
<i>Good. That's good. That's what
I was hoping you'd do.</i>

40:17.832 --> 40:20.417
So, awesome.

40:20.502 --> 40:22.586
Yeah. Yeah, it is good.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.173
Okay, I know we didn't plan this,

40:26.299 --> 40:29.092
and, you know, neither of us really thought
it was gonna happen,

40:29.177 --> 40:30.677
<i>but life is like that, you know,</i>

40:30.762 --> 40:32.387
<i>you can't plan for it.</i>

40:32.472 --> 40:33.805
<i>And even if we did plan,</i>

40:33.890 --> 40:36.683
<i>life doesn't care about
your plans, necessarily.</i>

40:36.768 --> 40:39.603
<i>And you just kind of have to go
with the flow and, you know,</i>

40:39.687 --> 40:43.857
I know my job is to just support you
in whatever it is you wanna do,

40:43.983 --> 40:45.859
and, I'm in, you know.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.653
<i>So whatever you wanna do,</i>

40:47.737 --> 40:49.530
<i>I'm gonna do, you know. It's...</i>

40:50.114 --> 40:53.033
I'm on board. Yay!

40:54.494 --> 40:55.934
I really appreciate you saying that.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.956
<i>No problem. You know, so I'll tell you,</i>

40:59.040 --> 41:02.543
<i>you know, maybe if you could
help me by telling me, like,</i>

41:02.669 --> 41:05.629
<i>one thing that I am supposed to do,
then that would be good,</i>

41:06.881 --> 41:09.132
<i>because I literally have
no idea whatsoever.</i>

41:09.217 --> 41:11.468
I have no idea, either.

41:12.887 --> 41:17.641
So, do you want to, like, get together
and talk about it or something like that?

41:17.725 --> 41:19.560
- Yeah, sure.
<i>- Like a date? I mean...</i>

41:19.644 --> 41:21.019
Yeah.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.405
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.657
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.492
No problem. Come on in.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.620
- Everyone, this is Allison.
- Hi.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.665
- Ally. Hey. Jason, I'm sure you remember.
- Yes.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.166
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.919
Your body's responding
really well to the pregnancy.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.087
Thank you.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.214
It's amazing how fast the milk arrives.

41:49.299 --> 41:50.674
Oh.

41:50.758 --> 41:51.842
How's your sis?

41:51.926 --> 41:53.051
She's good.

41:53.094 --> 41:55.345
- Oh, good. Tell her, "What's up?" for me.
- Okay.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.098
All right, I'm gonna go make
a protein shake.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.352
And this beautiful young man is Jonah.

42:02.437 --> 42:03.854
- Hi.
- Hey.

42:06.566 --> 42:09.610
Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there.

42:09.694 --> 42:10.777
Hi.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.780
I'm gonna grab my shirt.
Just take a seat if you want.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.198
- Okay.
- Cool.

42:22.415 --> 42:24.458
You are scared, aren't you?

42:31.382 --> 42:33.759
- Just another day at the office.
- Uh-huh.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.556
Do you have any acting experience?

42:39.641 --> 42:41.058
No. Uh-huh.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.644
How's it going?
You wanna toke?

42:43.728 --> 42:45.979
No. I'm good.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.147
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.483
- I'm Jodi.
- Yeah, hi.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.401
- I heard you were pregnant.
- Mmm-hmm.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.236
Oh, aren't you scared?

42:53.321 --> 42:55.739
The way it's gonna
come out of your...

42:55.823 --> 42:58.825
It's gonna hurt a lot, I bet.
Your vagina...

42:58.910 --> 43:00.994
That's so sick.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.245
I don't know.

43:02.330 --> 43:03.664
Are you hungry?

43:03.748 --> 43:05.749
No, I'm okay right now.
Thank you.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.835
You must be angry at the baby whenever
it steals your food, huh?

43:08.920 --> 43:10.587
"Oh, it's mine, not yours."

43:10.672 --> 43:14.841
But, you know, because you're family,
you got to share.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.009
Right.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.012
Man, my balls are shaved.
My pubes are trimmed.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.431
I'm ready to fucking
rock this shit.

43:21.516 --> 43:22.766
What the fuck, man?

43:22.850 --> 43:26.103
If I go in there and see fucking
pubes sprinkled on the toilet seat,

43:26.187 --> 43:28.105
I'm gonna fucking lose my mind!

43:28.189 --> 43:29.773
Last time I went
to the bathroom, Jay,

43:29.857 --> 43:32.776
I took a shit and my shit looked
like a fucking stuffed animal!

43:32.860 --> 43:34.778
You're embarrassing me
in company.

43:34.862 --> 43:36.279
You embarrass yourself.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.949
Oh, great. I hope you have
a great evening!

43:39.033 --> 43:41.535
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

43:41.661 --> 43:43.120
See you guys later.

43:45.873 --> 43:49.668
The funny thing is I really had never
even thought about having a baby.

43:49.794 --> 43:51.878
- Yeah.
- I mean, if this hadn't happened,

43:52.004 --> 43:54.756
I don't think I would have
wanted to have a baby for like,

43:54.882 --> 43:57.217
- I don't know, at least 10 years.
- At least!

43:57.343 --> 44:00.137
God, I mean, honestly,
I just got used to the, like,

44:00.221 --> 44:02.973
notion that someone would even
have sex with me.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.225
I didn't think
this would happen.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.394
Get ready.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.360
This will be coming out of you
in seven months.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.241
This is exactly what
our baby will look like.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.985
- It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
- It is. It's not bad.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.236
Hello, Mommy.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.904
Our baby's gonna be
French-Canadian.

44:18.030 --> 44:19.230
With a little hint of Spanish.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.411
- Baby books.
- Awesome.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.055
"What to Expect When You're Expecting."

44:26.080 --> 44:27.456
What can we expect?

44:27.540 --> 44:30.375
Well, you can't eat sushi.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.252
You can't smoke.

44:32.336 --> 44:35.756
You can't smoke marijuana.
You can't smoke crack.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.507
You can't jump on trampolines.

44:37.592 --> 44:40.302
This is basically a giant list
of things you can't do.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.887
Yeah, it sounds thrilling.

44:41.971 --> 44:44.291
I'm gonna be sitting there on the
trampoline smoking crack.

44:44.891 --> 44:47.017
And you're not gonna have anything to do.
You're gonna be bored.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.741
But I can't wait to read these, honestly.

44:48.811 --> 44:50.479
Seriously, I put these in front
of my toilet, though,

44:50.563 --> 44:52.272
they'll be read by tomorrow morning.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.690
- Do you want me to get you that?
- Yeah.

44:53.775 --> 44:55.150
- You like it?
- Yeah, thank you.

44:55.234 --> 44:56.485
No problem.

44:56.569 --> 44:58.236
These are heavy.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.046
So what do you think?
Should we have sex tonight?

45:15.630 --> 45:17.130
Sounds awful.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.802
I'm just really constipated.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.054
Do you really want to?

45:24.138 --> 45:25.472
Well, now...

45:25.556 --> 45:26.973
Shut up.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.934
It's pretty crazy,
your sister's pregnant.

45:29.018 --> 45:30.435
We have to help her.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.396
I think they'll be fine.
Look at us. It happened to us.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.649
We'll help her raise the baby.

45:35.733 --> 45:36.983
Well...

45:38.820 --> 45:40.028
Fuck!

45:45.952 --> 45:49.246
At least we don't have
to use a condom, you know?

45:50.331 --> 45:53.542
But we can. I don't... I brought some
just in case. I don't...

45:53.626 --> 45:56.044
I don't have VD or anything.
I mean, I don't, I thought...

45:56.128 --> 45:57.337
It's not that.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.755
You know, it's just...

45:58.840 --> 46:03.385
I thought maybe we could get a little fun
out of your situation, you know?

46:03.469 --> 46:06.346
Okay, first of all, it's not my situation.
It's our situation.

46:06.430 --> 46:07.722
I know, of course, I know that.

46:07.807 --> 46:09.641
And just because I'm pregnant,
I'm not some ruined woman

46:09.725 --> 46:11.101
and all romance goes out the door.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.144
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

46:14.814 --> 46:16.273
It's just...

46:17.441 --> 46:20.360
I like you a lot.
That's all this is. That's...

46:24.115 --> 46:25.323
I like you, too.

46:25.408 --> 46:26.825
Sweet.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.827
A little, so far.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.911
I mean, we have seven months
before the baby comes.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.622
- We don't have to rush it.
- Yeah.

46:32.707 --> 46:35.667
We should really just try
to get to know each other

46:35.751 --> 46:37.669
and give this a real shot.

46:37.753 --> 46:40.964
You know, we got ourselves into this
situation. We kind of have to.

46:41.048 --> 46:43.383
- For the baby, right?
- Exactly.

46:45.970 --> 46:49.347
Okay, if this was our second
date, what would you do?

46:49.432 --> 46:54.311
B.J., if I'm just being
honest, I would probably...

46:54.395 --> 46:58.440
I told my roommates I thought I
was gonna get a B.J., so...

46:58.524 --> 46:59.608
You know what?

46:59.692 --> 47:02.532
For the sake of getting to know one
another, can you not talk like that?

47:02.612 --> 47:06.489
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm... I'm really nervous.

47:06.574 --> 47:08.408
I'm nervous, too.
I'm really nervous.

47:08.492 --> 47:10.076
Yeah.

47:21.547 --> 47:24.049
You're a sweet guy, right?

47:24.133 --> 47:26.593
I think I am. Yeah.

47:26.677 --> 47:28.720
Don't fuck me over, okay?

47:29.096 --> 47:30.805
I wouldn't do that.

47:31.641 --> 47:35.060
Just so you know,
I'm the guy girls fuck over.

47:35.144 --> 47:37.270
I'm that guy.
So you don't fuck me over.

47:37.355 --> 47:38.438
- Okay?
- Okay.

47:38.522 --> 47:41.858
I couldn't take it.
I can't raise this baby alone.

47:58.334 --> 47:59.626
Who's he?

47:59.710 --> 48:01.336
I'm Ben Stone.

48:02.296 --> 48:04.130
He's my boyfriend.

48:06.133 --> 48:07.759
That's nice.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.511
I've never met him before.

48:09.595 --> 48:11.429
Well, he's a new boyfriend.

48:11.514 --> 48:12.722
But a boyfriend.

48:12.807 --> 48:15.976
So he came over for breakfast because
he's your new boyfriend?

48:16.060 --> 48:17.936
Yeah. He came from his house.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.688
Drove over to our house

48:19.772 --> 48:22.607
because he thought it would be fun
to have breakfast with us,

48:22.692 --> 48:26.820
so he drove his car from his house
to our house to have breakfast.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.030
Because he likes breakfast so much.

48:29.115 --> 48:31.032
I love breakfast.

48:31.117 --> 48:35.286
You guys wanna hear something neat?
We're gonna have a baby together.

48:35.371 --> 48:37.372
- What?
- Yeah, a baby.

48:37.456 --> 48:38.790
Well, you're not married.

48:38.874 --> 48:41.001
Aren't you supposed to be
married to have a baby?

48:41.085 --> 48:42.293
You don't have to be.

48:42.378 --> 48:44.629
But they should be because they
love each other,

48:44.714 --> 48:48.258
and people who love each other
get married and have babies.

48:48.342 --> 48:49.342
Mmm-mmm.

48:49.677 --> 48:51.428
Do you love each other?

48:51.512 --> 48:54.848
Yes, they love each other.
Because that's what you do.

48:54.932 --> 48:58.935
When you love each other, you get married
and have a baby.

48:59.019 --> 49:00.687
Where do babies come from?

49:00.771 --> 49:02.772
Where do you think
they come from?

49:02.857 --> 49:06.109
Well, I think a stork,
he drops it down,

49:06.193 --> 49:08.278
and then a hole goes
in your body,

49:08.362 --> 49:10.780
and there's blood everywhere,
coming out of your head,

49:10.865 --> 49:14.200
and then you push your belly button,
and then your butt falls off,

49:14.326 --> 49:17.370
and then you hold your butt
and you have to dig,

49:17.496 --> 49:19.706
and you'll find a little baby.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.666
That's exactly right.

49:22.042 --> 49:23.877
Feed the teddy bear.

49:24.003 --> 49:26.504
Okay, I feed your bear the grass?

49:28.382 --> 49:29.632
Okay.

49:30.176 --> 49:33.470
You know what your bear would also like
to do with some grass?

49:33.554 --> 49:34.888
Smoke it.

49:35.639 --> 49:38.475
What do you think of him?
He's funny, right?

49:38.559 --> 49:39.768
Mmm-hmm.

49:39.852 --> 49:41.478
Fetch.

49:41.562 --> 49:43.354
All right, bring it back.

49:44.190 --> 49:46.191
He's playing fetch with my kids.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.776
He's treating my kids
like they're dogs.

49:47.860 --> 49:49.235
No, he's not.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.528
Go get it! Fetch!

49:50.613 --> 49:52.530
Who plays fetch with kids?

49:52.656 --> 49:54.741
He's trying. He's making an effort.

49:54.867 --> 49:57.243
- Bring it back.
- He's overweight.

49:57.369 --> 49:58.703
Where does that end?

49:58.829 --> 50:00.580
- How old is he?
- 23.

50:00.706 --> 50:02.040
Looks 33.

50:02.666 --> 50:05.376
He can barely get in and out
of that little house.

50:05.503 --> 50:07.420
Imagine how much bigger
he's gonna get.

50:07.546 --> 50:09.714
That means he has bad genes.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.050
Your kid is gonna be overweight.

50:12.134 --> 50:13.426
Shit.

50:13.552 --> 50:15.053
I'm gonna get you!

50:15.721 --> 50:17.430
I'm gonna get...

50:20.226 --> 50:22.060
Just give him a break.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.023
Okay. I'll try.

50:34.406 --> 50:36.157
They seem to love bubbles.

50:36.242 --> 50:39.369
Oh, God. They go
ape shit over bubbles.

50:39.453 --> 50:40.537
They're really going ape shit.

50:40.621 --> 50:44.123
I mean, that's an incredible
thing about a child.

50:44.250 --> 50:45.730
I mean, what's so great
about bubbles?

50:45.793 --> 50:48.962
They float. You can pop them.
I mean, I get it. I get it.

50:49.088 --> 50:52.215
I wish I liked anything as much
as my kids like bubbles.

50:52.299 --> 50:54.634
- That's sad.
- It's totally sad.

50:54.760 --> 50:59.639
Their smiling faces just point out
your inability to enjoy anything.

50:59.765 --> 51:01.808
Am I gonna be okay, man?

51:02.601 --> 51:04.644
Oh, who knows?

51:05.604 --> 51:07.814
Is anybody okay? I'm not okay.

51:07.940 --> 51:09.440
You're asking the wrong guy.

51:09.567 --> 51:12.610
Just don't ask me to lend you
any money, you know?

51:12.736 --> 51:14.612
Can I just have some?

51:15.447 --> 51:16.573
No.

51:19.994 --> 51:22.537
I have 15 years
of tennis lessons.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.748
And 12 years of sucking dick lessons.

51:25.833 --> 51:26.916
So?

51:27.001 --> 51:28.668
I can't ref the next games,
by the way.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.754
I got to go meet gynecologists
with Allison.

51:31.839 --> 51:33.840
She doesn't like her gynecologist.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.342
- You think she likes you?
- She's trying to.

51:37.261 --> 51:40.096
- She's entertaining the idea of liking you.
- Exactly. I'll take that.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.599
Yeah, well, see, she's bringing you
to the gynaechiatrist.

51:42.683 --> 51:44.851
- She must like you.
- Yeah. Pretty good, I think.

51:44.977 --> 51:47.697
You know who I'd like to get pregnant,
is that Felicity Huffman, man.

51:47.813 --> 51:50.189
Ever since Transamerica, I can't
get her out of my mind.

51:50.316 --> 51:52.525
Okay, guys. I hate to
crack the whip,

51:52.610 --> 51:54.777
but it's kind of business meeting time.

51:54.862 --> 51:57.196
I need moolah.

51:57.323 --> 51:59.866
- When do you think we can launch this site?
- Jeez.

51:59.950 --> 52:01.451
Look, man. You can't rush this.

52:01.535 --> 52:03.202
You know what happens
to these sites when they go up

52:03.329 --> 52:04.954
and they don't function well?
They die.

52:05.039 --> 52:08.541
Seriously, guys, let's say
I want to launch today.

52:08.667 --> 52:11.461
Let's start. Let's use that
as a jumping off point.

52:11.545 --> 52:13.546
Let's make this happen.
What can we do?

52:13.672 --> 52:16.382
Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so
I could work 12 hours a day.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.967
I thought you went
to Santa Monica City College.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.636
I went where I went, Jason.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.554
I'm not asking you
to work 12 hours a day.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.307
I mean, you guys watch movies
without nudity in them.

52:24.391 --> 52:27.271
I'll tell you what, man. We could probably
get it online in three months.

52:27.311 --> 52:28.978
Thank you. Yes! Three months.

52:29.063 --> 52:30.897
Come on, Jason!

52:31.023 --> 52:32.398
Fuck off!

52:32.524 --> 52:34.901
Yeah, well, you still have
a little dick, Cartman.

52:36.195 --> 52:37.904
- Do you have mints?
- Yeah, right there.

52:38.030 --> 52:39.906
I see what you're saying. Totally.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.908
I don't get how you're comfortable
with any of these guys

52:41.992 --> 52:43.660
when they're doing
what they're doing to you.

52:43.744 --> 52:45.912
First guy...

52:45.996 --> 52:48.748
Oh, there that shit is.
I've been looking for that.

52:48.874 --> 52:51.834
The first guy, when he put his finger
in, he gave me this look like,

52:51.919 --> 52:56.756
"Sorry, man, it's the job" and I'm like,
"Don't look at me when your finger's..."

52:56.882 --> 52:59.676
I mean, get in and get out. Get on
with your day, you know?

52:59.760 --> 53:03.262
That's the closest I'll ever come to
being in a threesome, I think.

53:03.389 --> 53:04.430
Really?

53:04.556 --> 53:07.016
If you had to do a threesome with me
and one of my other roommates,

53:07.101 --> 53:08.685
who would it be?

53:08.769 --> 53:09.769
Um...

53:10.437 --> 53:11.437
I'm gonna have to go with Jay.

53:11.522 --> 53:12.772
Oh, no.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.023
- Yeah.
- Jay?

53:14.108 --> 53:17.276
I'm really turned on by his
sort of skinny awkwardness

53:17.361 --> 53:20.113
- and his hot little Mohawk.
- His Mohawk.

53:20.239 --> 53:23.533
You two are never allowed to be in
the same room ever again.

53:23.617 --> 53:26.703
If we ever had a three-way with Jay,
you turn around, he'd be sucking my dick.

53:26.870 --> 53:27.954
I'm telling you right now.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.540
- Do you smoke cigarettes?
- No.

53:30.624 --> 53:33.292
Do you smoke cigarettes?

53:33.377 --> 53:34.794
I have on occasion.

53:34.878 --> 53:37.159
On occasion? When? When was
the last time you had one cig?

53:37.214 --> 53:38.673
You know, one, you know, little...

53:38.757 --> 53:41.384
I need to know,
or I will not be your doctor.

53:42.970 --> 53:44.721
How you doing?

53:44.805 --> 53:47.974
I'm breathing like James
Gandolfini over here.

53:48.475 --> 53:51.394
Slow down, man. You're making me look
like a jackass.

53:51.478 --> 53:53.146
How long you kids been married?

53:53.272 --> 53:54.564
- We're not.
- No.

53:54.648 --> 53:55.648
You're single?

53:55.691 --> 53:58.067
She's not single.
She's just not married.

53:58.152 --> 54:00.153
Are you two together?

54:01.405 --> 54:03.406
Hey, you wanna trade boyfriends?

54:04.575 --> 54:06.826
Just kidding. Kind of.

54:11.832 --> 54:16.169
That is not your vagina.
That's your asshole.

54:16.295 --> 54:18.046
That happens about five times a day.

54:18.922 --> 54:20.762
Are you sure you don't
wanna come paintballing?

54:20.841 --> 54:23.009
Have fun, guys. Seriously.
Watch the eyes.

54:23.135 --> 54:24.927
- See you, guys.
- See you, Ally. Bye.

54:25.012 --> 54:28.347
I don't wanna go.
I swear to God.

54:28.432 --> 54:31.017
I wanna see Breathless
at the LACMA.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.687
Boobs! Boobs, boobs, boobs!

54:34.772 --> 54:36.147
Hold on, pause it,
pause it, pause it.

54:36.231 --> 54:37.774
Boobs and bush!
Boobs and bush.

54:37.858 --> 54:39.525
- Good boobs.
- Those are good ones!

54:39.651 --> 54:41.402
We're like 35 seconds in. Nice.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.321
Right in the beginning credits.
Credit bush.

54:43.447 --> 54:45.927
- You never get opening credit bush.
- I know. That's so crazy.

54:46.533 --> 54:47.700
No.

54:49.328 --> 54:52.622
You got me.

54:53.373 --> 54:55.458
How many doctors are there
in your practice?

54:55.542 --> 54:58.044
Just 'cause I'm sort of looking for a
more personal experience.

54:58.170 --> 55:01.297
I wanna make sure that you're my doctor
on the day, and...

55:01.381 --> 55:03.174
Yeah, I understand.

55:03.550 --> 55:08.054
We have three other doctors in the
practice, but I'm your man, okay?

55:08.138 --> 55:10.890
I don't take vacations.
I hate Hawaii.

55:11.558 --> 55:13.351
I went to the Caribbean
when I was 14,

55:13.477 --> 55:15.812
and I'm never going back.

55:15.896 --> 55:18.272
I feel really good about this.
I think we found our doctor.

55:18.357 --> 55:19.565
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:19.650 --> 55:20.900
All right.

55:20.984 --> 55:23.361
- Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

55:23.445 --> 55:24.612
Wow.

55:24.696 --> 55:26.823
- You look relieved.
- I am very relieved.

55:26.949 --> 55:29.992
I can't imagine meeting
any more of you people.

55:30.118 --> 55:31.998
You're being dramatic.
We didn't meet that many.

55:40.504 --> 55:41.879
Do they know?

55:41.964 --> 55:43.089
Pardon?

55:44.341 --> 55:46.217
The belly.

55:46.301 --> 55:48.970
Oh, yeah. The donuts,
they call to me.

55:49.888 --> 55:52.640
- Hey, Allison. Great job.
- Thanks.

55:54.685 --> 55:57.895
- You're pregnant, aren't you?
- What?

55:57.980 --> 56:00.565
I mean, you've put on like,
eight pounds, nine.

56:00.649 --> 56:02.567
It's all in your uterus.

56:03.151 --> 56:04.485
Oh, shit.

56:05.320 --> 56:08.364
I haven't told them. Do you think
they're gonna be mad?

56:08.490 --> 56:10.950
I'm, like, really
chickening out about this.

56:11.034 --> 56:13.077
It's okay. We can hide this.

56:13.161 --> 56:16.789
We'll dress you in black, and
we'll emphasize your boobs.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.040
Awesome.

56:18.166 --> 56:20.710
I mean, your boobs
are gonna be big.

56:20.836 --> 56:23.087
And then they're gonna
be, like, scary big.

56:23.171 --> 56:26.799
But then they'll go down.
And then they'll stay down.

56:26.884 --> 56:29.552
Just... Just don't say anything, okay?
Please don't say anything.

56:29.678 --> 56:33.431
Oh, no, I won't, I won't.
Just tell them. They'll be cool.

56:34.349 --> 56:36.893
Everybody loves
somebody pregnant.

56:39.229 --> 56:41.898
Did you see
this sex offender website?

56:41.982 --> 56:44.692
These are all the sex
offenders in our neighborhood.

56:44.776 --> 56:47.695
Looks like your computer
has chicken pox.

56:47.779 --> 56:49.447
Those are sex offenders.

56:49.531 --> 56:51.866
These people live
in our neighborhood.

56:51.950 --> 56:53.784
Well, I'll skip their houses
when we're trick-or-treating.

56:53.869 --> 56:56.245
What do you want me to do?
Form a posse?

56:56.330 --> 56:58.706
Got your six-shooter on you?
I got my lynching rope.

56:58.790 --> 56:59.957
You shouldn't take it
so lightly.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.208
I don't take it lightly.

57:01.293 --> 57:04.003
You know, I'm not gonna go over to
any of these people's houses and say,

57:04.087 --> 57:06.213
"Hey, do you mind... Can you baby-sit?"

57:06.298 --> 57:08.174
If I didn't care about
these things,

57:08.258 --> 57:09.800
you wouldn't care about anything.

57:09.885 --> 57:11.052
Care more.

57:11.136 --> 57:13.721
You're so concerned with stuff, like
"Don't get them vaccinated."

57:13.805 --> 57:16.098
"Don't let them eat fish. There's
mercury in the water."

57:16.183 --> 57:18.768
Jesus, how much Dateline NBC
can you watch?

57:18.852 --> 57:21.312
I know we're supposed to be nice
with each other right now,

57:21.396 --> 57:22.756
but I'm having a really hard time.

57:22.814 --> 57:24.941
- I'm struggling with it right now.
- What am I doing?

57:25.025 --> 57:29.111
'Cause I want to rip your fucking head
off because you're so fucking stupid!

57:29.237 --> 57:32.448
- This is scary. These are our children.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

57:32.574 --> 57:36.369
- You fucking dipshit. God! You...
- Mmm-hmm.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.080
I literally am at a point where
I don't know what I can say.

57:39.164 --> 57:40.331
So I'm the bad guy

57:40.415 --> 57:43.584
because I'm trying to protect our kids
from child molesters and mercury?

57:43.669 --> 57:46.087
And you're cool 'cause you
don't give a shit.

57:46.171 --> 57:48.673
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Is that it?

57:48.757 --> 57:51.467
- Pretty much.
- God, you're an asshole.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.719
Don't do this in front of Ben.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.972
I don't give a shit about Ben.

57:56.056 --> 57:57.223
Sorry, Ben.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.308
It's okay. I didn't think
she did, anyway.

57:59.393 --> 58:01.018
Okay, come on! Let's go.

58:01.103 --> 58:02.728
Oh, I can't go.

58:02.813 --> 58:05.648
This band is doing a showcase
out in the Valley. I got to go.

58:05.732 --> 58:07.274
It's Saturday.

58:08.944 --> 58:10.069
I got to go.

58:10.445 --> 58:12.363
You don't want to know
the sex of the baby?

58:12.447 --> 58:14.156
That's no fun.

58:14.741 --> 58:17.618
Ben knows, but I've
sworn him to secrecy.

58:17.703 --> 58:19.370
I'll get it out of him.

58:19.454 --> 58:20.579
No.

58:27.295 --> 58:28.504
Hey.

58:28.588 --> 58:31.757
Think we'll ever be as happy
as Baby Bjรถrn couple is?

58:31.842 --> 58:33.592
We are that happy.

58:33.885 --> 58:35.428
Yeah. You look happy.

58:35.512 --> 58:38.097
Which is awesome, 'cause I never like
guys like you. It's great.

58:38.181 --> 58:39.974
You keep saying that. I know.

58:40.058 --> 58:42.309
This is it. This is perfect.

58:43.061 --> 58:44.395
Nice.

58:44.479 --> 58:46.397
Holy shit! It's 1,400 bucks.

58:46.481 --> 58:48.232
We can just borrow yours.
Is that okay?

58:48.316 --> 58:50.359
No. You need your own crib.

58:50.444 --> 58:53.112
You know, there's one of these lying
in an alley behind my house.

58:53.196 --> 58:55.823
We could just grab that.
Just rub Purell all over it.

58:55.907 --> 58:57.241
You know what? Let me buy it.

58:57.325 --> 58:59.118
I need to get you
a baby present anyway.

58:59.244 --> 59:01.287
- And I would love to get it for you.
- No.

59:01.371 --> 59:02.621
I'm serious. I want to.

59:02.706 --> 59:04.665
No. It's too much.

59:06.084 --> 59:07.960
Yes. We'll take it.

59:08.045 --> 59:11.130
Obviously, I mean, don't insult the woman.
She wants to get us a gift.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.298
Right.

59:12.382 --> 59:15.176
Wanna buy me some new shoes?
What else can I squeeze out of you?

59:15.260 --> 59:17.094
Xbox 360. Xbox 360.

59:19.222 --> 59:20.765
So hot in the Valley.

59:20.849 --> 59:24.018
Hey! Oh, Allison! Hi.

59:24.102 --> 59:25.686
How are you?

59:25.771 --> 59:28.272
It's so good to see you.

59:28.356 --> 59:30.436
We've been watching you on E!
It's the coolest thing.

59:30.484 --> 59:32.526
Yeah, it's been super
exciting, just crazy busy.

59:32.611 --> 59:34.111
I'm so sorry I haven't called.

59:34.196 --> 59:35.654
Oh, it's fine. Hi, I'm Ashley.

59:35.739 --> 59:36.906
- This is my friend, Ben.
- I'm Ben.

59:36.990 --> 59:38.324
I went to school with Allison.

59:38.408 --> 59:40.284
Okay, so, is Debbie
having another baby?

59:40.368 --> 59:42.787
No. Allison is.

59:42.871 --> 59:45.623
What? I just saw you a couple months ago.
You're pregnant?

59:45.707 --> 59:47.708
It was a big surprise.

59:47.793 --> 59:49.919
It's actually... It's a really
funny story, actually.

59:50.003 --> 59:51.504
If you guys... If you got
a second to hear it.

59:51.588 --> 59:53.172
It's not really funny.
It's not funny.

59:53.256 --> 59:56.008
Let them be the judge, okay?
I think it's funny.

59:56.134 --> 59:57.974
- You know they say don't drink and drive?
- Uh-huh.

59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.387
- Don't drink and bone!
- Wow.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:01.555
Okay.

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:04.683
Yeah, I mean,
she was acting weird,

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.408
and I really think
it's just 'cause, like,

01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:08.518
you know, I haven't made
an honest woman out of her.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:11.023
She's carrying my bastard child.
No one wants that.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.317
That's what I did. I mean, I married Debbie
when she got pregnant.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.944
You think she's, like,
hiding me?

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:17.404
Like, she's, like, embarrassed
by me or something like that?

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:19.573
Probably. I'd hide you.

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:21.408
How much do wedding rings cost?

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:22.952
I mean, it really depends,
you know?

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:26.080
I think you're supposed to spend,
like, three months' pay on a ring.

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:28.207
That'll be easy.
I don't make any money.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.793
Really? I thought there was
lot of money in porn.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:32.711
God, it's not porn, okay?

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:36.674
All we do is we show you what nude
scenes are in what movies.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.175
Oh, like Mr. Skin?

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.510
Who's Mr. Skin?

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.387
Dude, Mr. Skin.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:43.556
Mr. Skin?

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.183
No!

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.519
We've wasted 14 months of our lives.

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:51.147
This is exactly the same as our site.

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:52.481
How the fuck did this happen?

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.817
Mr. Skin. That's even
a better name than ours!

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.068
Fuck me in the beard.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.362
Dude, they got the top 10
group shower scenes!

01:00:58.446 --> 01:00:59.822
Why didn't you think
of that, Jay?

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.323
Don't put this on me!

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:02.491
God damn it!

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:06.704
Well, shit, I saw it online at one point,
but I guess I didn't connect the dots.

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:07.955
What are we gonna do now?

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:10.124
All we need to do is think
of a new, better idea

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.917
that no one else has thought of already.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.753
Oh, dude, Spider-Man 3
starts in eight minutes.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.173
Don't worry, man.
We'll figure it out.

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:25.556
You know what?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.642
I think just because
this site exists

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:31.061
doesn't mean our site
won't work, necessarily.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:32.563
Good things come in pairs, man, you know.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:33.981
Oh, for sure.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:37.735
Volcano, Dante's Peak,
Deep Impact, Armageddon, right?

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:39.486
Wyatt Earp, Tombstone.

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:42.156
Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.908
Exactly. We can work together.

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:46.160
This can help us,
if anything, I think.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:47.578
We're fine. We're golden.

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:53.167
Look, Allison, I'm sure this isn't how
you pictured it being, exactly,

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.502
and it's not how I wanted it to be,

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:58.631
but that is why I'm presenting
you this empty box.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.549
It's a promise, Allison.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:03.302
It's a promise
that one day I will...

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:07.806
I will fill this box with a ring that
you deserve, a beautiful ring.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.475
And I can't afford it yet.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:13.938
I've picked it out already, though, and
it's at De Beers, and it's really nice.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:18.442
So basically I'm asking you,
will you marry me?

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:21.153
Because I'm in love with you.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.949
I love you, too.

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:26.492
Really?

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.827
Oh, man, that's so nice to hear.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:32.748
That's the first time a girl's
ever said that to me, so...

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.960
But here's the thing.

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.461
There's a thing?

01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:41.507
I don't really know yet what
that love means, you know.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:45.678
Just 'cause it's so new, and it's so
exciting that it's great.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:49.723
I don't know. We've only known each
other 17 weeks, so it's...

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.225
Okay.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:54.270
Honestly, I mean, I thought...

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.939
I thought you felt weird
that we're having a baby

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.565
and we're not
engaged or anything.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:02:59.942
- I'm gonna get off my knee.
- Yeah.

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:01.527
It's hurting a little bit.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:02.903
No, I'm okay with that.

01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:05.656
You know, we're just doing
what we can.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.825
We're making the best of it,
and I don't want us

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:10.286
to put any more pressure on ourselves
than we already have.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:11.954
Okay. Yeah. That makes perfect sense.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:13.580
Are you okay? I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:16.583
No, no, no. Honestly, I just wanted
to do right by you, you know?

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:19.545
So if you don't want to,
that's totally cool, you know?

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.879
Okay.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.257
I really do love you.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:24.925
I know. Thanks.

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:27.344
You mentioned that. It's nice.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.145
Ben proposed to me.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.689
- What?
- He did.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:42.151
It was really sweet. I kind of feel
a little bit bad about it.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.570
He was, like, wearing
this great little button-down.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:48.324
He tucked his shirt in. He got down
on one knee. It was so sweet.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:51.160
He didn't have an actual ring, though.
It was just an empty box.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:54.246
But, you know, he had this whole spiel
about when he has the money,

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:57.499
he's gonna buy me the ring that
I deserve and...

01:03:57.584 --> 01:03:59.460
The box was just empty?

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:01.712
I mean, he can't afford a ring, so...

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:04.923
So he got down on one knee
and gave you an empty box?

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.383
Yes.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:07.968
I'm sorry.

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:10.054
Get over it. It was sweet.

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:12.778
I'm telling you, if you'd been there,
you would have probably cried.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.725
- You need to train him.
- Huh?

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:18.937
Oprah said that when two people meet,

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:23.067
they are forced to point out each
other's differences and flaws.

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:26.511
I thought you were supposed to just accept
people for who they are, love them anyway.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.322
You criticize them a lot,

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:31.617
and then they get so down on themselves
that they're forced to change.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.285
Really? You don't think
that would just make it worse?

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.495
That'd be, like, naggy.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.997
And then in the end,
they thank you for it.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.459
You can't commit to him. You can't
make a commitment to him.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:44.421
You don't even know him. I don't even
know Pete after 10 years.

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:46.715
- What?
- I don't know what he's up to.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.175
He's miserable.

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.510
Why do you say that?

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.845
- I think he's cheating on me.
- What?

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.641
He's always going off to these business
meetings at odd hours.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.393
And then I try to call him
on his cell phone,

01:04:57.477 --> 01:05:00.729
and he says that he's in bad
cell phone reception areas

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.190
when he's in good
cell phone reception areas.

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:04.817
Maybe he's working late.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.860
You know, I mean, maybe
he's just working really hard

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:08.821
to sign a new great band
or something.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.656
I can't imagine Pete doing
something like that.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:15.202
There's no part of you that thinks that
maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:17.162
No. Mmm-mmm.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.664
I think he might be.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.875
"Memory Spy, web memory software."

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.461
"Locate history files, websites visited,"

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:28.715
"hidden downloads, searches,
email history. Memory Spy."

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:33.137
Let's see you hide
from me now, little man.

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:43.480
So you're not even
gonna tell them?

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.941
No. You know, I don't have to tell them.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.986
It's illegal for them
to fire me over it anyway,

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.905
and I get three months
maternity leave if I stay,

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:54.283
so I'm just, you know,
not gonna tell them.

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:56.076
- That's a good plan.
- Yeah. I like it.

01:05:56.161 --> 01:06:00.497
It is a good plan until her water breaks
all over Robert De Niro's shoes.

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:03.876
"My shoes! Hey, there's all this
baby goo on it."

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.754
"These shoes? On these shoes?"

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:09.131
"Did you puke on my shoes?"

01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:11.842
"Did your water break on my shoes?"
"Did you puke on my shoes?"

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.260
Oh, my God.

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:16.054
Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid
and all your dreams and hopes

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.557
just go right out the window?

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.768
What changed for you? What went
out the window? What plans?

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:23.729
You do everything
exactly the same.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.653
No, I mean, I love what
I'm doing. Like, say...

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.276
Okay, say, you know, before you're married
and have children,

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.361
you wanna go live
in India for a year.

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:34.239
You can do it. But you can't do it
once you have a family.

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:36.533
- You wanna go live in India?
- I don't wanna go live in India.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:39.953
Do you want to go to India? Go to India!
Seriously, go to India.

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:41.538
What about you? Do you want
to go to India?

01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:43.707
I'm not going to India.
You can go to India.

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:45.209
I get what he's talking about.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:48.212
You know, honestly, like,
when I found out about...

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:54.468
I totally, like, I just had this flash
of me, like in a white Ford Bronco,

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:57.513
and I'm just hauling ass
for Canada, man.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:00.015
The chopper's taping
the whole thing, and I just...

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.226
I bust through the border
and I'm a free man!

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.061
That's all I kept thinking, man.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:05.562
You know what I'm saying?
It was a flash!

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.523
- Wait. What do you mean? What are you...
- Don't look at me.

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:09.889
- We can talk about our fears here.
- It's not like he did it.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:13.141
I mean, honestly, like, if Doc Brown screeched
up in front of you in the DeLorean.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:15.239
Open the door, he's like,

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:18.784
"Hey, Allison, come on. I got the car
here. What do you wanna do?"

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.578
No part of your brain would have been,
like, "You know, maybe we'll go back"

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:25.165
"to that night and I would maybe
put a condom on Ben's dick."

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:28.085
- You never got that flash?
- No.

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:30.295
And I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.715
"Where we're going,
we don't need roads."

01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:35.259
Exactly. You wouldn't do that?

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:38.095
I don't know who Doc Brown is.

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:39.263
What are you talking about?

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:41.473
Doc Brown is the guy who's
Christopher Lloyd.

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:43.016
He invented the DeLorean,
the time machine.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.351
- He's the one who made the time machine.
- What?

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:47.396
It's the time machine. Everyone has
the time machine image.

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:50.649
Hey. I have a really good idea.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.611
Why don't the two of you
get into your time machine,

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:57.656
go back in time and fuck each other?

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.116
Who needs a time machine?

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.701
This is my time machine!

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:03.954
I'm gonna throw you in my
DeLorean, gun it to '88.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.418
You are a funny motherfucker,
man. Jesus.

01:08:09.544 --> 01:08:13.046
How can you fight with him? Look at
his face. I just want to kiss it.

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:14.798
I think he's cute.

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:16.883
I like the way you move.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:21.555
This is fun! We should
do this more, I think.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:24.279
I mean, this is, like, the most fun
I've had in a really long time.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:34.401
- Come on, harder.
- I can't do it harder.

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:37.404
Why? Come on. Come on,
just do it. Deeper.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.031
- I can't.
- Oh, why?

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:42.200
- I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
- Oh, come on! Just do it!

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.536
Please, don't yell at me,
please don't.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:47.497
What? The doctor and Debbie
said it's fine. Come on!

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.707
Look, can we... I'm sorry,
can we change positions?

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.169
- What?
- I'm gonna crush the baby. I know it.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:54.295
- This is ridiculous! Why are we...
- No, it's not.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:55.881
There's no shell in there,
you know?

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.175
Millions of people have sex
when they're pregnant!

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.594
I don't know how it works.
It just works, okay? Just do it.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:03.305
All I'm thinking of is that I'm gonna...
I weigh over 200 pounds.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.642
- Just get over it!
- I can't do it. Can you just get on top?

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:10.187
All I see is our baby getting poked
in the face by my penis.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:11.813
- Trust me, you're not even close.
- Okay.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.814
- Come on, fine.
- Okay, fine.

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.111
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:20.322
- That's okay.
- Sorry.

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:22.366
Okay. Oh, good.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.701
I can't. I can't.

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:27.871
I can't. I can't do this, I just... I
can't. I can't. I can't focus like this.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:30.957
I look disgusting from this angle. I can
feel you looking up at my chins.

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.921
- I know I look gross.
- No, you look beautiful.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.169
Your chin looks so skinny.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:36.505
And my boobs are all, like, squishy,
and they're flopping around.

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.799
- I can feel it, and it's distracting.
- No...

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.341
it's all National Geographic.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:43.220
Okay. Can we do... Do you
wanna do doggie style?

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:46.515
No. I do not want you
to fuck me like a dog.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.643
I'm not fucking you
like a dog. It's doggie style.

01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:52.604
It's just the style.
It's not...

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:56.817
It's not like a dog. We don't have
to go outside or anything.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.363
- Here we go.
- Okay. Okay.

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:02.656
- Okay, is it good?
- Yeah.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.582
- Should I go slower?
- Yeah, no, that's good.

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:05.951
- Okay, faster?
- Harder.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:07.536
- Just tell me when you're close.
- Just go harder.

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:10.163
- Okay.
- Keep going!

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.957
Oh, God.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.500
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:14.793
- What happened?
- Oh, my God.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.254
- The baby, it kicked my hand.
- Well, no, no, it always kicks.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:20.018
- No, no, no. Not like this.
- No, it's fine. It's fine. Just keep going.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:21.550
It was a warning kick.
This was a bad kick.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.552
No, no, it's fine.
It's fine! It's fine!

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:26.054
Look, my dick must be like
an inch away from its face,

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.014
- and it's coming, just coming in at its face.
- Oh, shit.

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.821
What if it kicked 'cause it didn't like it?

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:33.311
I can't do that to our baby.
That's the first thing it's gonna see.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:34.938
What are you talking about?

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:37.149
It's having the baby between,

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.526
you know, us, it just makes it
weird. I'm sorry.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.319
It just freaks me out a bit.
It's a little weird.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:42.612
I have totally lost it.

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:44.781
- You've totally lost it?
- I've lost it.

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:46.032
Okay.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.451
Great, you know what?
Just forget it.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:50.036
Okay. Okay, fine.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.332
Don't worry. I won't
make you do this again.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.709
Shit.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:12.893
Fuck me!

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:15.020
Oh, my God. It's the Russians!

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.941
- Jodi, I'll protect you!
- Oh, man!

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.276
Ben!

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:24.029
Oh, my God.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.740
Oh, God. Oh, no!

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.242
Oh, God, that was horrible!
That was so horrible!

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:30.869
When will it be light out?

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.621
Okay, you're fine, man. Take it easy.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.825
- Hey, did anybody turn off the gas?
- I didn't do it.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.249
Oh, motherfucker.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.210
- Hey, Marty.
- Yeah.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.670
This is my friend, Alex. She's a pretty
incredible person.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:42.798
Okay. Nice to meet you.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:46.259
Whoa, dude! Not cool, Martin.

01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:48.303
That's... That wasn't...

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:49.888
Hey, are you serious,
Howard Hughes?

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.599
- What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:54.935
- Come on.
- Where were you?

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.687
Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.
I'm sorry, okay?

01:11:57.772 --> 01:12:00.690
Yeah, 'cause you're getting
high off your huge bong.

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:01.900
How am I supposed
to be comfortable

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.860
with the idea that you can
take care of me and the baby

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:06.154
if you are always getting high?

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:07.572
You want me to stop smoking pot

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.699
'cause there's an earthquake
once every 10 years?

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:13.286
That makes no sense, Allison.
Look, you're being irrational.

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:15.652
Just relax, okay? We're all scared,
you know? You just...

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.250
Oh, shit, the cops.

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:22.170
California, eh?

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:45.485
You know, it's times like this
I'm glad I don't own nice things.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:48.051
It's a big mess, but there's only like
$50 worth of shit here.

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.073
And that's kind of the good thing.

01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:52.409
You know, my dad told me,
"Don't move to Northridge."

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:55.620
But you figure, like, what are the chances
of that happening twice, you know?

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:56.913
What is this?

01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:58.373
It's a ninja weapon.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:04.004
I hope this place doesn't get condemned.
That would suck.

01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:44.878
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.923
<i>- You!</i>
- Hi. So, listen.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:49.754
Will you do me a big favor?

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.509
Debbie wants us to come over
and have dinner tonight.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.303
She thinks Pete is cheating on her.

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:55.138
<i>- Really?</i>
- Yeah.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:56.890
<i>Well, she saw one of his emails and...</i>

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:58.975
- Oh, man.
<i>- There's an address.</i>

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.860
That sounds terrible.
I don't want to do that.

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:02.479
Ben, come on.

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:03.813
He's not cheating on her.

01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:05.607
- How do you know?
<i>- I just know.</i>

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:08.068
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
- I'm 100 % sure he's not cheating.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:09.611
<i>Are you really?</i>

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:11.279
No.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.031
It actually kind of makes sense
that he would cheat.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.199
Why?

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.785
'Cause Debbie's a pain in the ass
and Pete's awesome.

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:21.122
Why don't you just come over then, and
we'll just diffuse the situation a little.

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:23.500
I'm just saying the music industry
is different now.

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:26.586
You can't... Steely Dan would never
even have a chance.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:29.547
Well, maybe it's 'cause Steely
Dan gargles my balls.

01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:31.424
- They're incredible.
- They really aren't good, man.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:32.676
Old Steely Dan.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.094
If I ever listen to Steely Dan,

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:36.554
I want you to slice my head
off with an Al Jarreau LP.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:40.850
Oh, I should get going.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:43.520
I'm supposed to see this
band tonight in Hollywood.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.284
Actually, they're playing
in Laurel Canyon,

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:48.358
so I'll call you 'cause the reception's
terrible over there, so...

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:49.526
Okay.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:52.278
And I don't want you to worry
'cause I know you worry.

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:53.683
I'm just gonna jump
in the shower.

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:56.616
It would be terrible if I smelled
worse than the band.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:59.119
Okay. Have fun.

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:00.537
All right.

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:06.251
You guys are crazy. He's acting totally
normal and hilarious.

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:21.224
She doesn't have a gun,
does she?

01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:23.309
No. I don't think so.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:39.117
Looks like no one's home.

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:41.369
Why was the door unlocked?

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:42.829
Wait here.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.136
I kind of feel bad for Pete.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.471
What?

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:01.765
This isn't a good way, you know.

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:05.101
If you're gonna get caught cheating,
it shouldn't be like this.

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:08.855
Well, maybe he should've thought of
that before he was cheating.

01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:10.523
- Pete!
- Stop it.

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:13.276
I coughed. What do you want from me?

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.653
There's nobody up there.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:16.905
Thank you.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:19.240
I guess I was wrong.

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:20.366
I told you.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:22.702
- Can we get out of here, please?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go.

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:24.871
- Suck it!
- Did you hear that?

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.332
- What?
- I didn't hear anything.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:45.892
Carlos Delgado. Excellent choice.

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:48.311
Too bad I got him three rounds ago.
You're still on the clock.

01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:50.146
- Oh, shit!
- You gotta do something.

01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:51.981
We need a name.

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:53.316
Hideki Matsui.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.735
- You just took my whole outfield.
- Sorry, Charlie.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.403
What is this?

01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:58.822
Debbie.

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:01.074
What the fuck is this?

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.951
It's our fantasy baseball draft.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:04.452
We said no wives.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:05.912
Your fantasy what?

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:09.749
It's our draft for fantasy baseball.

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:12.085
I told you all about this.

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.586
Got Matsui.

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:17.674
Shit!

01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:21.469
Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out!

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.763
- Come on, who's going?
- Prince, you're on the clock.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.807
I should have told you.

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:28.434
- What else have you been lying about?
- Nothing...

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:29.602
That guy said,

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:32.480
"Don't let the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out."

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.190
Yeah, I heard him.

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:35.859
That was hilarious.

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:38.743
It's just that I know you've been mad
'cause I've been working so much,

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:40.280
and I didn't want to upset you.

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:42.699
I wouldn't be mad. I don't get mad.

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:46.119
It's a fantasy baseball draft.
I'm not cheating or anything.

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:48.037
No, this is worse.

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:49.622
How is this worse?

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:54.210
This is you wanting to be with your friends
more than your family.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:57.630
Look, the reason I make that up is because
if I told you what I was really doing,

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.299
you would just get mad.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:04.304
So you think I'm seeing a band, I do my
fantasy draft, and it's win-win.

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:08.975
Well, what'd you do last Wednesday night
when you said you went to see a band?

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.310
I went to the movies.

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:12.478
- With who?
- By myself.

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:14.189
What'd you see?

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.690
Spider-Man 3.

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:18.401
Why do you want to go by yourself?
Why didn't you ask me to go?

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:20.045
Because I needed to get away, you know.

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:23.239
With work and you and the kids, sometimes
I just need some time to myself.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:26.409
I need time for myself.
I want time for myself, too.

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:28.411
You're not the only one.

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.496
It's not that big of a deal.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:34.167
I like Spider-Man.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.502
Okay, so let's see
Spider-Man 3 next week.

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:39.088
I don't wanna go see it now.

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:42.091
I don't wanna have
to ask you to ask me.

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:45.345
I want you to just come up
with it on your own.

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:48.097
I don't even know what to say.
What do you want me to do?

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:53.436
You just think because you don't yell
that you're not mean, but this is mean.

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:56.314
I'm not being mean.
I'm being honest.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.774
You're telling me
I need to be honest.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.776
No, you're not. You're lying.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:03.738
I'm doing it because I need to
keep my sanity a little bit.

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:08.993
You know what? I don't want you
at the house anymore, okay?

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:11.621
Come on.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:15.124
Shit, she's coming back.

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.670
How come we go to
the gynecologist so often?

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:22.924
I bet we have to go so much so we can
pay for that $300,000 machine he has.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:28.388
I cannot stop thinking
about what an asshole Pete is.

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:32.767
That's a little strong, I would say.

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:33.935
Really?

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:38.064
'Cause that had to be one of the most
selfish things I've ever witnessed.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:40.748
It's understandable, I would say.
I even think it's kind of funny.

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:43.528
What's funny about it?

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.947
Well, you won't laugh now,
I wouldn't imagine,

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:49.117
but, you know, the situation.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:51.411
We break into this stranger's house

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:54.664
thinking we're gonna find him
sleeping with a woman,

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:57.375
and it's a bunch of nerds
playing fantasy baseball.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.836
If you saw that, like,
on television, you would laugh.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.047
Is that what you think?
Is that what you wanna do, Ben?

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.550
I don't even like baseball.

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:09.304
I'm just saying, when you're a guy and,
you know, you have a family,

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.889
you have responsibility,
you lose that male camaraderie.

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.601
And I get that. I totally understand
where he's coming from.

01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:17.103
Why do guys always go
to that place?

01:20:17.187 --> 01:20:19.272
"We miss male camaraderie."
Why do I give a shit?

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:22.358
Go hang out with your bearded
freak friends. I don't care.

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:25.643
You wanna hang out with guys that look
like the shoe bomber, it's all on you, man.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.238
What the fuck am I supposed to say to that?

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.406
You should just support me!

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.908
You know, you should just
support everything I say

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:33.536
because at this juncture in my life,
I'm allowed to be wrong!

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.246
- So if you're wrong, I have to support it?
- Yes!

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.332
I can't tell you that you're
acting like a lunatic?

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:38.791
- No.
- No? Okay.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:41.002
That's helpful. You have to do nothing!

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:43.212
I've sacrificed a lot of shit to do this!

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:44.922
- You haven't sacrificed anything!
- I have.

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:49.385
I've had to sacrifice my job,
my body, my youth, my vagina!

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:50.720
You've sacrificed your vagina?

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.639
Yes! It will never look
the same after this!

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:59.812
Well. Fine. I'm sorry, I'll pay for vaginal
reconstructive surgery.

01:20:59.897 --> 01:21:02.273
You can't pay for shit!
You can barely buy spaghetti!

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.734
You're right! Fine! Okay.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.986
You know what? Get out of the car.

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:08.821
You know what? How...

01:21:08.906 --> 01:21:10.156
Why don't you not threaten me?

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.241
You should just get out
of the fucking car.

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:14.535
I'm not gonna get out of the car
in the middle of nowhere! No!

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.661
- Get out of the car!
- No.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:18.206
- I own this car! Get out of my car!
- No.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:19.415
- Get out of my car!
- No.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.626
Get out of my fucking car!

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:35.807
Can you let me back
in the car, please?

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.893
Have you calmed down?
Did you take a breath?

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:43.564
I have no clue where we are!

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:46.234
Fine. Go.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:52.657
Great.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.051
Okay.

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:16.931
Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or
my belt buckle, my belt buckle's huge.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:18.391
Don't worry about gaining weight.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:21.477
Your baby wants you to gain
a whole mess of weight.

01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:22.770
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:25.273
Why don't you take off your earrings, too?
They weigh about 80 pounds.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:26.441
They're made out of moon rocks,
aren't they?

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:29.318
Do not make fun of me.
Okay? I am hormonal.

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:31.654
I am terrified, and I am falling apart,

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:34.073
so stop treating everything
like it's a big joke!

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:35.558
Okay, I'm sorry
you're freaking out,

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:38.911
but I just walked three fucking miles
through Koreatown to get here!

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:40.916
Sorry if I'm trying to lighten
the mood a little.

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:42.123
Well, don't, okay?

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:44.125
You can't take anything seriously!

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:46.009
You know, you didn't even
read the baby books.

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:48.921
I didn't read the baby book!
What's gonna happen?

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:51.841
How did anyone ever give birth
without a baby book?

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:55.011
That's right. The ancient
Egyptians fucking engraved

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:57.555
What to Expect When You're Expecting
on the pyramid walls!

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.056
I forgot about that!

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.893
Who gives a flying fuck
about the baby books?

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:04.353
It just shows your lack
of commitment, Ben!

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:06.898
That you're not in this with me!

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:10.359
Did you just say "my lack of commitment"?
'Cause that's what it sounded like.

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:15.615
It almost seems as though you forgot
I proposed to you, like an asshole!

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:17.533
And you said no to me!

01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:19.702
If you feel that way,
you should just go.

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:21.245
Really. Just go.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.081
Because we didn't mean
to do this together, okay?

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:28.294
And... And we tried to make it work
and that was good, I suppose.

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:29.962
But it doesn't work.

01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:32.381
Because we are two
completely different people.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:36.052
And I think it would just be easier for
both of us if we stop fooling ourselves.

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:38.496
You know, I know this isn't you talking,
it's your hormones,

01:23:38.555 --> 01:23:41.724
but I would just like to say,
fuck you, hormones!

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:46.395
You are a crazy bitch, hormones.
Not Allison! Hormones!

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.690
Fuck them! It's a girl!
Buy some pink shit!

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.984
Nice. You are such an asshole.

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:55.279
You know what?
Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:58.491
I will fuck my bong.
Doggie style, for once.

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:04.413
Are you ready?

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.961
I'm really sorry about all that.
That was really inappropriate.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.505
Oh, no, that's okay. It happens all
the time here. It's fine.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:14.302
Oh, good, okay, I don't
feel so stupid, then.

01:24:14.327 --> 01:24:15.327
No, no, not at all.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.052
I totally know what you're
talking about, man.

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:21.889
Like, if I wrote out the list of
shit Allison doesn't let me do,

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:26.310
like, it would be endless. "Don't smoke pot.
Don't have samurai swords in your room."

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:28.854
"Don't have illegal grow
operations in the house."

01:24:28.939 --> 01:24:31.065
I mean, like, I could go on all
fucking day.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:34.735
Have I told her to stop
doing anything ever? No.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.654
Marriage is like that show,
Everybody Loves Raymond,

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:38.239
but it's not funny.

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:41.033
All the problems are the same,
but it's...

01:24:41.118 --> 01:24:43.411
You know, instead of
all the funny, pithy dialog,

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:46.872
everybody's just really
pissed off and tense.

01:24:46.957 --> 01:24:51.669
Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version
of Everybody Loves Raymond.

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:54.213
But it doesn't last 22 minutes.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.091
It lasts forever.

01:24:58.385 --> 01:25:02.263
Let's get out of here, man.
Honestly, like, let's just go.

01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:04.348
- Let's go to Vegas.
- Let's do it.

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:05.850
- Yeah.
- Why not?

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:13.024
- Get up.
- What?

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.268
- We're not gonna do this.
- What?

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:15.568
Seriously.

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:19.030
What are you doing?

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:22.742
We have to go do something
and have fun!

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:25.202
I'm just so tired.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:26.537
I know you're tired.

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:29.999
But we're gonna be untired!
We're gonna go live!

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.461
I hate you so much sometimes.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:34.879
We're gonna be positive.

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:37.632
Positive, positive, positive! Up!

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:39.091
How many Red Bulls have you had?

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:42.094
I've had about three Red Bulls
in the last 15 minutes.

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:43.721
And I feel fabulous!

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:47.600
We're gonna create a new life
and it's gonna be awesome!

01:25:47.768 --> 01:25:49.727
Get up! Let's go!

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:54.398
Since when do we lock
this fucking thing? Come on!

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:01.197
We can't go, dude. Sorry.

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:03.449
Holy crap! What happened?

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:05.201
We got pink eye.

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:07.244
What, you giving each other
butterfly kisses or something?

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:09.529
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
That's not how you get pink eye.

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:13.042
You get it from poo particles making their
way into your ocular cavities.

01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:15.753
- Hey, Ben. How's it going?
- Yo.

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.547
I farted on Jason's pillow
as a practical joke.

01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:20.758
He farted on Jonah's,
thinking it was mine,

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:24.553
and then eventually
pink-eyed my pillow.

01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:29.392
I'm not proud of any of this, but I think
we've all forgiven each other.

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:31.686
But we can't go anywhere.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:34.063
You can get pink eye
from farting in a pillow?

01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:35.398
- Totally.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:26:35.482 --> 01:26:36.816
That's awesome!

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.734
Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed.

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:40.236
Jesus, Martin got it bad!

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.571
What, did someone take a dump
right in your eye?

01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:45.574
No. No pink eye for me.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.495
I'm just really high.

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:53.666
Well, stay back, guys.
I got to get my suit, okay?

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:56.669
Fuck you.

01:26:59.089 --> 01:27:00.715
Are you Debbie's husband?

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:02.007
Yeah.

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:07.638
- This is fun!
- This is great.

01:27:07.764 --> 01:27:09.924
- It's just fun, man.
- We're gonna have the best time ever.

01:27:10.016 --> 01:27:12.184
- We make a good team, man.
- Yeah.

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:14.311
It's like, I can't come here
with Debbie.

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.439
She wouldn't understand it.
She doesn't understand.

01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:19.233
She wants to hold me in, and she was
telling Allison she could train you.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:20.609
She thinks she could train me?

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:22.194
Yeah, like you're running
the Triple Crown.

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:25.281
She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried
and Roy's Bengal.

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:27.283
You think I'm trained. I'll...

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:29.327
- I'll bite your fucking face off!
- That's right.

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:30.828
In front of a crowd, baby.

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:34.874
This is better. Besides, I don't know if I
have enough of these babies to go around.

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.375
My God! Are these mushrooms?

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:37.960
Uh-huh. I got them from
a roadie for the Black Crowes.

01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:39.128
I'm eating them.

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:41.881
No, no, no. Save it! I got tickets
to Cirque Du Soleil.

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:43.716
You do? No, you don't.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.092
I swear to God, man.

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:47.136
Holy shit!

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.846
See? I see the beam of light.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:51.223
There it is, baby! Whoo-hoo!

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:53.893
You're so money that you don't even know
how much money you have.

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:56.812
You're money, baby!
You're money!

01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:03.402
I love Vegas, man.

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:05.237
This is the greatest place
on Earth.

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:08.407
- It's really amazing here.
- You got my tie!

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:11.202
This is awesome!

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:16.081
Now, that's how you get pink eye.

01:28:22.756 --> 01:28:25.633
Hey, what's up? Baby girl.

01:28:25.759 --> 01:28:27.009
Hi.

01:28:27.093 --> 01:28:29.261
- What's up?
- End of the line, please.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:31.555
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:34.558
Oh, come on.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.936
Look, we're at capacity, okay?

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:38.854
We'll let some people in
when it clears out a little.

01:28:38.939 --> 01:28:42.233
You'll get right in if you go
back to the end of the line.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.235
We come here all the time.
It's not a big deal.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:46.153
It doesn't really look
that crowded in there.

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.155
Hey, look. I don't make the rules.

01:28:48.281 --> 01:28:49.365
Please?

01:28:49.449 --> 01:28:51.033
No.

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:54.912
Hey, what's up, shorty?
What's up, pretty girls?

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.874
See y'all when y'all get out.

01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:00.626
Watch yourself.

01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:02.378
What was that?

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:04.672
- What the fuck was that?
- It is what it is, sweetie.

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:05.840
Now can you step
to the back, please?

01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:07.550
- You don't need to call me sweetie.
- Maybe we should just go.

01:29:07.634 --> 01:29:08.759
Maybe you should listen to your friend.

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:09.927
No, you don't need to call me sweetie.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:12.179
All right, you want to come in,
you're gonna have to go

01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:14.515
to the end of the line and wait
like everybody else.

01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:16.183
I'm not gonna go to the end
of the fucking line.

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:17.434
Who the fuck are you?

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:20.396
I have just as much of
a right to be here

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.106
as any of these little skanky girls!

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.983
What, am I not skanky enough for you?

01:29:24.067 --> 01:29:25.776
You want me to hike up
my fucking skirt?

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:29.154
What the fuck is your problem?
I'm not going anywhere!

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:32.199
You're just some roided out
freak with a fucking clipboard!

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:35.202
And your stupid little fucking
rope! You know what?

01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:37.997
You may have power now,
but you're not God!

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:40.082
You're a doorman! Okay?

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:45.629
You're a doorman, doorman,
doorman, doorman, doorman!

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:49.425
So, fuck you, you fucking fag

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.552
with your fucking little
faggy gloves.

01:29:58.685 --> 01:29:59.977
I know.

01:30:02.188 --> 01:30:04.523
You're right. I'm so sorry.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.568
I fucking hate this job.

01:30:07.694 --> 01:30:11.238
I don't want to be the one to pass
judgment and decide who gets in.

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:13.324
This shit makes me sick
to my stomach.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.951
I get the runs from the stress.

01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:19.288
It's not 'cause you're not hot.
I would love to tap that ass.

01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:22.666
I would tear that ass up.

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:26.629
I can't let you in 'cause you're old
as fuck, for this club,

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:29.381
not, you know, for the Earth.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:30.507
What?

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:32.343
You old. She pregnant.

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:35.387
Can't have a bunch of old,
pregnant bitches running around.

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:36.931
That's crazy.

01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:41.769
I'm only allowed to let in 5% black
people. He said that. 5%.

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:43.771
That mean if there's
25 people here,

01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:46.565
I get to let in one-and-a-quarter
black people.

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:49.109
So I got to hope there's a black
midget in the crowd.

01:30:49.235 --> 01:30:51.445
Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.030
Why y'all wanna be in here anyway?

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.990
Y'all need to be at a yoga
class or something.

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:57.034
What the fuck is she doing at the club?

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:59.453
That's not even good parenting
right there.

01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:02.122
Your old ass should know better than that.

01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:03.582
Oh, God.

01:31:08.254 --> 01:31:10.547
Have the mushrooms
kicked in yet?

01:31:35.615 --> 01:31:38.283
This was a great idea, man.

01:31:38.368 --> 01:31:41.620
This is the best idea
I've ever had in my life.

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:47.918
What are they gonna do?

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:54.258
What in the world
are they doing?

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:58.178
If I shaved my stomach and my chest,
I would look exactly like that.

01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:01.724
Those guys are at work right now.

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:05.894
"What'd you do today?"
"I just lifted my brother."

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:10.357
No. Don't applaud. He'll fall.

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:16.905
I'm freaking out right now, man.

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:19.324
The mushrooms are turning on me.

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:26.665
Papa.

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.542
I'm not your papa!

01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:30.836
Papa!

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:35.424
I can't deal with this shit, man!

01:32:37.177 --> 01:32:40.387
Hold up. Hold up. Ben, wait.
Ben, Ben, Ben, wait!

01:32:45.685 --> 01:32:47.019
It's over.

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:48.270
What's over?

01:32:48.354 --> 01:32:49.605
My youth.

01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:51.440
Oh, don't say that.

01:32:51.524 --> 01:32:52.983
It's true.

01:32:54.527 --> 01:32:58.030
- I just wanna dance. I love dancing.
- So dance.

01:32:58.156 --> 01:33:00.407
I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.

01:33:00.492 --> 01:33:02.451
I should be embarrassed.

01:33:02.535 --> 01:33:07.206
I'm a fucking whale, and I'm trying to get
into some stupid club and...

01:33:07.332 --> 01:33:09.124
No, you look beautiful.

01:33:09.209 --> 01:33:11.251
And you're young and you're tall,

01:33:11.377 --> 01:33:15.005
and you got the good lips and boobs,
and you're young still.

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:17.591
I'm gonna be alone.

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:18.759
Debbie, no, you're not.

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:20.344
Yes, I am.

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:24.515
Oh, God!

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.726
Fucking men!

01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:33.148
I get worse-looking and he
gets better-looking,

01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:35.567
and it's so fucking unfair.

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:38.362
Oh, fuck.

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:40.614
We should go.

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:46.120
My babysitter always gets mad
when we come home past 12:00.

01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:51.208
She's such a pissy little high-school cunt.

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:55.754
<i>Let's move, gang! Come on,
come on, come on!</i>

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.005
<i>Jessica, can you get these plates</i>

01:33:57.090 --> 01:33:58.841
<i>- and put them on the table, please?</i>
- This isn't funny.

01:33:58.925 --> 01:34:00.801
That guy has 12 kids. It's not funny.
It's...

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:02.245
<i>Now I get to start all over again!</i>

01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:04.721
This is sick. This is a sick movie.

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:08.892
That's a lot of responsibility to be
joking about. That's not funny.

01:34:08.977 --> 01:34:11.145
I got to turn this off.
It's freaking me out.

01:34:11.271 --> 01:34:13.772
There are five different types
of chairs in this hotel room.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.578
Holy fuck. What are they
all doing in here?

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:17.317
These are five different types of chairs.

01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:20.404
Get them out of here, man. This is
too many chairs for one room.

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:23.368
There's a guy that works for this hotel.
His whole job is to find chairs.

01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:24.908
Look at this one. Look at it.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:26.702
It's gold and red, and it's kind of shiny.

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:28.370
Shiny thread? Unbelievable.

01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:31.165
It is beautiful and it feels amazing.

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:34.626
The tall one's gawking at me and
the short one's being very droll.

01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:35.752
I don't like them.

01:34:35.795 --> 01:34:37.045
Oh, wow.

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:40.465
It's weird that chairs even exist
when you're not sitting on them.

01:34:40.592 --> 01:34:43.594
I'm up high!
I'm really high up.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:46.013
I should've read the baby books.

01:34:46.139 --> 01:34:47.890
Why didn't you read
the baby books?

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:49.725
'Cause then it's real, you know?

01:34:49.809 --> 01:34:51.849
Dude, it's real whether or not
you read those books.

01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:54.354
That baby's coming.

01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:56.398
Oh, man!

01:34:56.482 --> 01:34:58.150
Think they'll take us back?

01:34:58.234 --> 01:34:59.484
Yes.

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:03.238
But I don't know why.

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:05.782
Do you ever wonder how somebody
could even like you?

01:35:05.825 --> 01:35:08.952
All the time, man. Like every day.
I wonder how you like me.

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:12.998
How can Debbie like me? She likes me.
I mean, she loves me.

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:16.126
The biggest problem in our marriage is that
she wants me around.

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:17.294
She loves me so much

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.755
that she wants me around all the time.

01:35:19.839 --> 01:35:22.841
That's our biggest problem.
And I can't even accept that?

01:35:22.967 --> 01:35:24.384
Like that upsets me?

01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:25.636
What?

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.262
She's the one. She loves me.

01:35:27.347 --> 01:35:30.474
You can't believe people love you?

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:33.769
I love you, man! Debbie loves you!

01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:35.479
I don't think I can accept her love.

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:36.843
There's something wrong with me.

01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:40.067
You can't accept love?

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:41.318
I don't know what it is.

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:44.196
Love? The most beautiful, shiny,
warmy thing in the world?

01:35:44.322 --> 01:35:45.405
You can't accept it?

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:47.199
I have to go to this other chair.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.827
Oh, this is a better energy.

01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:54.122
You can't accept pure love?
You can't accept Debbie?

01:35:54.207 --> 01:35:56.416
She's chosen to give you her life.

01:35:56.542 --> 01:35:59.378
She's picked you as her life partner!

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:02.172
But you play fantasy baseball because
you can't accept her love?

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:06.510
I could accept it, man.

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:09.221
And Debbie's amazing, man.

01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:12.641
She's cool and she's funny
and she smells good

01:36:12.725 --> 01:36:15.769
and she's nice and her hair
always looks different.

01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:17.229
She's too good for you, man.

01:36:17.313 --> 01:36:19.398
Tastes like a rainbow.

01:36:19.732 --> 01:36:22.150
You're disgusting. You know,
you're an urchin.

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:24.653
And she busts your balls
'cause you're a little bitch.

01:36:24.737 --> 01:36:28.115
You're a filthy bitch!
And I'd bust your balls.

01:36:29.367 --> 01:36:33.412
Debbie wants to give her life to you, and
Allison doesn't want to do that with me.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:35.747
And it makes me sad all day.

01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:39.001
I want to go home.

01:36:39.085 --> 01:36:40.752
I wanna go home, too.

01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:45.924
- Everything looks beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:47.509
I went kind of overboard, huh?

01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:48.844
No. It's great.

01:36:48.928 --> 01:36:51.763
Your daughter only turns eight once.

01:36:51.848 --> 01:36:53.974
Is Ben gonna come?

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:56.768
I don't think so. I don't know
why he would.

01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:12.784
Oh, hey. What up, dawg?

01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:14.036
Where have you been?

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.704
Around. You know?

01:37:15.788 --> 01:37:17.539
Just kind of doing my thing.

01:37:17.623 --> 01:37:19.499
Why is everybody so mad at you?

01:37:19.584 --> 01:37:21.418
I don't know. Are they mad?
What have they been saying?

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:25.839
They've been saying, like, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, "Ben's a prick."

01:37:25.923 --> 01:37:26.923
They said that?

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:28.508
A lot.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:29.801
That sucks.

01:37:29.886 --> 01:37:31.595
What does it mean?

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:34.389
Penis. It means penis.

01:37:34.474 --> 01:37:35.640
Oh.

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:38.602
Penis.

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:42.981
Babe, we're running low on plates.

01:37:43.066 --> 01:37:44.399
Hey, Ben! What's up, man?

01:37:44.484 --> 01:37:45.901
What's happening, man?

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:47.903
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, Debbie.

01:37:47.987 --> 01:37:49.488
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:50.781
Hi.

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:54.159
Did you just get pink cupcakes
or yellow cupcakes?

01:37:54.243 --> 01:37:55.619
I just got yellow cupcakes.

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:57.204
I thought I said get pink cupcakes.

01:37:57.288 --> 01:37:59.831
- I can run out. I'll get some more.
- Nah, it's no big deal.

01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:01.333
- I don't mind.
- No, it doesn't matter.

01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:03.168
- You sure?
- Yeah. You look really cute in that.

01:38:03.252 --> 01:38:04.669
All right.

01:38:07.006 --> 01:38:09.591
- Well, that was fast, you pussy.
- I'm a...

01:38:09.675 --> 01:38:15.430
You're the one that got dressed up like
a cholo on Easter to come to this party.

01:38:15.515 --> 01:38:18.016
How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace?

01:38:18.142 --> 01:38:22.437
You look like Babe Ruth's
gay brother, Gabe Ruth.

01:38:22.522 --> 01:38:25.774
Well played, sir. That was good.

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:26.942
You gonna talk to Allison?

01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:28.610
Yeah, I was just about to.

01:38:28.694 --> 01:38:30.195
Right on.

01:38:30.279 --> 01:38:31.738
It's a doll.

01:38:31.823 --> 01:38:33.281
Thanks, Ben.

01:38:36.035 --> 01:38:38.954
I just don't think we can make it work.

01:38:39.038 --> 01:38:41.957
We can get back on track,
and everything's gonna be great.

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:44.793
You're just being nice,
and I'm being nice,

01:38:44.877 --> 01:38:49.047
and just because we're two nice people
doesn't mean we should stay together.

01:38:49.132 --> 01:38:53.260
I don't want this baby to determine
the rest of our lives. You know?

01:38:53.344 --> 01:38:55.887
Me not wanting to do this alone
isn't enough of a reason

01:38:55.972 --> 01:38:59.975
to drag you into a relationship
with me. It's just not fair.

01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:05.230
And don't repeat this, but God,
I don't want to end up like Debbie.

01:39:05.314 --> 01:39:06.481
But Debbie's happy.

01:39:06.566 --> 01:39:08.650
Yeah, she's happy today.

01:39:08.734 --> 01:39:10.986
But every day is a constant
struggle for them

01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:12.737
because they're not
right for each other.

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:15.864
You know? And they have to force it,
and I don't want us to have to do that.

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:19.077
I don't want to force you to be
what I think you should be.

01:39:19.162 --> 01:39:21.496
That's wrong of me because you're great.

01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:25.667
You really are. You're great
the way you are, and...

01:39:25.751 --> 01:39:29.921
I mean, you like to get high, and you
like to do shrooms in Vegas.

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:32.257
- I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
- Who am I to stop you?

01:39:32.341 --> 01:39:35.260
Who am I to tell you that that's wrong?
It's not wrong. It's who you are.

01:39:35.386 --> 01:39:37.929
It's what you enjoy and that's
your life and...

01:39:38.055 --> 01:39:41.266
I'm not that guy anymore.

01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:43.268
I mean, we can be friends.

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:47.189
And you can be there
when the baby is born,

01:39:47.273 --> 01:39:49.441
and in the baby's life
as much as you want.

01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:51.359
I hope you will be.

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:54.779
I just... I think that if you just...

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:57.866
I don't know. If you give me a shot
to just show you that I'm...

01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:59.117
- Excuse me?
- Oh, shit.

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:00.443
Can you grab the video camera?

01:40:00.453 --> 01:40:03.371
- We're gonna sing Happy Birthday now.
- Yeah.

01:40:03.623 --> 01:40:06.291
I'm sorry. I got to go.

01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:07.459
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:40:07.585 --> 01:40:08.793
I'll be right back, though, all right?

01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:11.296
- We'll finish talking.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, go.

01:40:16.552 --> 01:40:17.636
What happened?

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:18.887
Thanks for warning me, man.

01:40:18.971 --> 01:40:21.890
I just walked into a fucking
buzz saw. She rejected me.

01:40:21.974 --> 01:40:24.309
'Cause you, for some insane reason,

01:40:24.393 --> 01:40:26.811
told Debbie that I did mushrooms
with you in Vegas!

01:40:26.938 --> 01:40:28.063
She gets mad 'cause I smoke pot!

01:40:28.147 --> 01:40:30.315
Now I'm upping it to fucking
psychedelics! Thanks!

01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:32.234
Really? I thought she'd take you back.

01:40:32.318 --> 01:40:34.194
You know why she just rejected me?

01:40:34.278 --> 01:40:35.718
'Cause you're such a shitty husband,

01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:39.074
she thinks I'm gonna turn
into a shitty husband.

01:40:44.497 --> 01:40:48.166
Happy Birthday to you

01:40:48.292 --> 01:40:51.795
Happy Birthday to you

01:40:53.506 --> 01:40:56.424
- Jessica! Right here!
- Can we get a photo?

01:40:56.509 --> 01:40:58.510
- When are you due?
- I got two months.

01:40:58.636 --> 01:40:59.761
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:40:59.845 --> 01:41:02.847
- Wow, you're so big already.
- Yeah.

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:05.684
- When is that baby popping out?
- I got two months to go.

01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:08.353
- Really? Are you dilated yet? I can tell.
- Wow, wow!

01:41:08.437 --> 01:41:12.524
You look fantastic. You look... Are you
gonna, like, give birth right now?

01:41:12.650 --> 01:41:15.026
Wow, you're about
to drop any second.

01:41:15.152 --> 01:41:16.361
You know what? I love your broach.

01:41:16.445 --> 01:41:18.780
You don't need to lie to me.
I don't appreciate it.

01:41:18.864 --> 01:41:20.407
I know I look like a fat cow.

01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:22.450
- And I'm sweating profusely. I know that.
- No, no.

01:41:22.535 --> 01:41:26.204
No, you don't look like a fat
cow at all. You look great.

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:28.206
So, I have to get going in.
They're calling me.

01:41:28.291 --> 01:41:30.411
Steve, hey. Help me out.
Give me an interview, please.

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:31.626
Well, I just need to run in.

01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:34.462
You know what? Just say into the camera,
"You're watching E! Entertainment."

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:35.714
- Congratulations.
- Just give me that.

01:41:35.798 --> 01:41:37.966
No, Steve, don't be
an asshole! Come on.

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:40.218
I'm not being an asshole.

01:41:40.886 --> 01:41:43.638
Wow, you managed to turn
Steve Carell into an asshole.

01:41:43.723 --> 01:41:45.682
- No easy feat.
- Shut up, Brent.

01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:48.310
You screwed me, Dad, okay?

01:41:48.394 --> 01:41:51.146
You said everything was gonna
be fine and nothing is fine.

01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:52.772
Nothing is fine.

01:41:52.857 --> 01:41:56.860
<i>Ben, I've been divorced three times.
Why would you listen to me?</i>

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:58.445
Because you were the only one
giving me advice!

01:41:58.529 --> 01:42:00.780
And it was terrible advice!

01:42:00.865 --> 01:42:04.576
<i>You can go around blaming everyone
else, but in the end,</i>

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:09.039
<i>until you take responsibility for yourself,
none of this is gonna work out.</i>

01:42:09.123 --> 01:42:12.125
I don't know how to take responsibility
for myself, okay?

01:42:12.209 --> 01:42:14.085
- I didn't read the baby books!
<i>- You didn't read the books?</i>

01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:16.755
I just smoke less pot. I don't know
what to do. I'm an idiot!

01:42:16.839 --> 01:42:19.049
What... Tell me what to do!

01:42:19.133 --> 01:42:21.259
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

01:42:21.344 --> 01:42:24.971
<i>Ben, I love you. What can
I tell you?</i>

01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:27.140
Just tell me what to do.

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:32.729
Stone, you settling in okay?

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:35.273
- Best job I ever had.
- Like to hear it.

01:43:42.466 --> 01:43:44.634
Allison, thank you
for coming in.

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:50.432
I don't want to shock you
but we know what's under that jacket.

01:43:51.267 --> 01:43:53.435
You're pregnant, have been for a while.

01:43:53.519 --> 01:43:56.813
From my count, you're right
around eight months.

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:59.774
And I don't know why you felt
you couldn't tell us.

01:43:59.859 --> 01:44:01.317
I'm really sorry.

01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:03.987
This is Hollywood. We don't like liars.

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:07.365
I just... I wasn't expecting this and...

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:10.160
I didn't know how to handle it,
and I didn't want to lose my job.

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:12.620
- I'm really sorry.
- It's unfortunate.

01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:15.457
It's unfortunate you didn't tell us because

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.626
you would've found out that we
thought it's great.

01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:20.044
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:44:20.129 --> 01:44:22.672
So we did some research.

01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:27.469
And turns out, people like pregnant.

01:44:27.553 --> 01:44:28.636
Oh, my God!

01:44:28.721 --> 01:44:30.441
The bigger you are, the bigger
your numbers.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:34.851
I was surprised 'cause I feel
the opposite.

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:41.858
We're gonna do a whole maternity
month on E! Mommy.

01:44:42.902 --> 01:44:45.570
You're gonna interview
all the pregnant celebs.

01:44:45.654 --> 01:44:47.363
- Really?
- Yes.

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:48.698
Scary!

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:53.119
You're pregnant, they're pregnant,
you can talk about being pregnant.

01:44:53.245 --> 01:44:57.207
It just grosses me out when I know
that people are pregnant.

01:44:57.291 --> 01:45:00.043
'Cause I think about the birth.
Everything's so wet.

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:02.754
And everything that goes into it.
None of the gross stuff.

01:45:02.838 --> 01:45:07.091
But you know, hopes, dreams,
whatever, it's gonna be great.

01:45:07.176 --> 01:45:09.385
Oh, my God. This is such good news.

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:11.554
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:15.225
And then, after the baby is out...

01:45:16.519 --> 01:45:18.478
- Tight.
- ...tighten it back up.

01:45:18.604 --> 01:45:20.480
- And please don't lie to us again.
- Okay.

01:45:20.564 --> 01:45:23.775
'Cause maybe someday
we could be friends.

01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:26.152
Okay. I won't. I'm sorry.

01:45:26.695 --> 01:45:28.655
- I just don't like secrets.
- Okay.

01:45:30.074 --> 01:45:32.274
You know, it's a rare thing
that you live to see the day

01:45:32.284 --> 01:45:34.577
your wildest dreams come true.

01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:37.997
I mean, what is there left to want?
I get to go to Legoland.

01:45:38.082 --> 01:45:39.290
- Shut up, Pete.
- Say it!

01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:40.708
- Legoland!
- Legoland!

01:45:40.793 --> 01:45:42.669
Legoland!

01:45:42.753 --> 01:45:44.629
Don't get them all riled up
before the drive.

01:45:44.713 --> 01:45:46.756
I shouldn't have given them
all that meth, then.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.258
We'll be back on Sunday.

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:50.718
Or Saturday. You never know.
We might see it all in one day.

01:45:50.803 --> 01:45:52.554
Sunday. Let's go.

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.264
Guess what? I'm scared
there's no one to trust.

01:45:54.348 --> 01:45:56.599
You can trust me.

01:45:56.684 --> 01:45:58.768
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:00.937
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:46:01.063 --> 01:46:02.647
You are.

01:46:07.278 --> 01:46:08.206
Ow, ow, ow.

01:46:08.231 --> 01:46:11.013
<i>That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.</i>

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:17.787
Hello?

01:46:17.871 --> 01:46:20.123
Hey, what's up, Daddy?
What are you doing?

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:24.377
Just smoking a joint, drinking
some beers, you know. Rocking.

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:26.879
We're about to go to a new club.
You coming?

01:46:26.964 --> 01:46:29.591
No. I'm gonna pack
it in soon, I think.

01:46:29.675 --> 01:46:31.301
What's he doing?

01:46:31.385 --> 01:46:32.594
He says he's gonna
call it a night.

01:46:32.678 --> 01:46:34.637
Dude, it's like 8:15, man.

01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:37.765
Yeah, I know. I'm just tired.

01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:39.934
- Is he depressed?
- You depressed?

01:46:40.019 --> 01:46:41.686
No, I feel great. I like it.

01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:43.229
He says no.

01:46:43.314 --> 01:46:44.674
Ask him if he's
gonna kill himself.

01:46:44.690 --> 01:46:46.024
You gonna kill yourself?

01:46:46.108 --> 01:46:48.109
No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.

01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:51.362
Tell him not to jerk off with a noose
around his neck. It's dangerous.

01:46:51.488 --> 01:46:54.448
You shouldn't jerk off with a noose
around your neck 'cause it's dangerous.

01:46:54.491 --> 01:46:55.950
Okay. Very good.

01:46:56.035 --> 01:46:59.704
And tell him if he has to, tell him he
needs a teammate or a spotter there.

01:46:59.788 --> 01:47:03.791
Right. And if you do, you should have
a teammate or a spotter there.

01:47:03.876 --> 01:47:04.959
Great.

01:47:05.044 --> 01:47:07.378
He says your mom's already there.

01:47:07.463 --> 01:47:08.755
Uncool, man.

01:47:16.388 --> 01:47:18.222
Okay, okay.

01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:19.641
Okay.

01:47:20.476 --> 01:47:21.643
Hi, Dr. Howard?

01:47:21.727 --> 01:47:23.728
No, this is Dr. Angelo.

01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:24.896
How can I help you?

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:27.148
I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's,

01:47:27.232 --> 01:47:29.901
and I'm going into labor and
I need to speak with him.

01:47:29.985 --> 01:47:31.653
<i>I actually don't know
where he is tonight.</i>

01:47:31.737 --> 01:47:34.614
But I've made myself available
to his patients,

01:47:34.698 --> 01:47:36.157
and I'd be happy to help you.

01:47:36.241 --> 01:47:38.576
Can you help me find him?
Can you give me his number?

01:47:38.702 --> 01:47:40.912
<i>Oh, no. You know what? Actually,
I'm under strict instructions</i>

01:47:40.996 --> 01:47:43.164
<i>not to give out his number, but
I can help you through this.</i>

01:47:43.248 --> 01:47:44.582
No, no. No, no, no.

01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:47.669
I want to speak to my own doctor.
You really won't give me his number?

01:47:47.753 --> 01:47:51.255
Because this is my first baby, and he
promised that he would be here for me

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.925
and I need you to give me...
Give me his number, okay?

01:47:54.009 --> 01:47:55.927
Dr. Howard's not available tonight.

01:47:56.011 --> 01:47:58.513
But everything's gonna be okay,
I assure you.

01:47:58.597 --> 01:48:02.600
No, I don't want you to help me
because I have no idea who you are!

01:48:02.726 --> 01:48:06.521
I want my own goddamn doctor!
You make sure he calls me!

01:48:06.605 --> 01:48:08.606
Oh, shit. Okay.

01:48:10.567 --> 01:48:12.402
Oh, shit!

01:48:24.373 --> 01:48:25.415
Hello?

01:48:25.541 --> 01:48:28.209
Ben, it's me. Can you come? 'Cause
the baby's coming. Can you come?

01:48:28.293 --> 01:48:32.130
Oh, God. Allison. I'm so happy
you're calling.

01:48:32.256 --> 01:48:34.799
I have so many thing's I've been
wanting to say to you.

01:48:34.925 --> 01:48:37.385
I wanna apologize for things.
It's all I can think about.

01:48:37.469 --> 01:48:38.970
No, listen. Wait. Listen.

01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:41.347
I need you to come help me, okay?
Because the baby's coming.

01:48:41.432 --> 01:48:42.598
So can you come help me?

01:48:42.641 --> 01:48:44.761
- Wait. The baby's coming right now?
<i>- Yes. Right now.</i>

01:48:44.768 --> 01:48:46.894
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:48:46.979 --> 01:48:50.356
Is it happening? It's happening now?
Push. Push...

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:53.919
- Breathe like this...
<i>- No, no, no, no.</i>

01:48:53.944 --> 01:48:56.696
You need to come now because
the contractions are happening,

01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:00.074
and they really hurt and the doctor isn't
here, and I can't get hold of him.

01:49:00.159 --> 01:49:03.953
And he said he was gonna be here, right?
You were there when he said that.

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:05.663
Okay, okay, I'll come right now.

01:49:05.789 --> 01:49:07.248
<i>- Nobody's here.</i>
- I'm coming right now.

01:49:07.332 --> 01:49:09.250
...not anywhere, I can't reach
them, please.

01:49:09.334 --> 01:49:10.835
- Please, please hurry.
<i>- I'll just... So should I...</i>

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:12.003
I'll meet you at the hospital, okay?

01:49:12.129 --> 01:49:15.465
No! Don't meet me at the hospital! No, no,
I need you to drive me. I can't drive.

01:49:15.549 --> 01:49:17.258
- I can't drive like this.
<i>- No? You can't drive? Okay.</i>

01:49:17.342 --> 01:49:18.968
I'll get gas and then I'll pick you up.

01:49:19.052 --> 01:49:20.887
- You have to get gas?
<i>- I need to just get cash.</i>

01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:22.472
No. Don't get cash. Just come.

01:49:22.556 --> 01:49:25.436
I need to get cash because my car's
on empty, I won't even make it there.

01:49:25.517 --> 01:49:29.061
No, just come right now. I'm not
fucking around, okay?

01:49:29.146 --> 01:49:30.772
This is serious and I'm alone.

01:49:30.856 --> 01:49:34.066
It's the last thing you need to do is...
Just get here!

01:49:34.151 --> 01:49:36.277
Look, if you keep yelling at me,
I'm never gonna get there.

01:49:36.361 --> 01:49:38.112
You just need to calm down
for two... Okay.

01:49:45.996 --> 01:49:48.998
Don't run out of gas. Don't run
out of gas. Come on!

01:49:54.004 --> 01:49:55.338
Hello?

01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:59.675
Please be in there.
Hello? Hello? Hello?

01:50:02.679 --> 01:50:04.013
Allison?

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:11.646
Hello?

01:50:11.730 --> 01:50:13.523
- Ben?
- Allison.

01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:15.928
What is this, like a water birth?

01:50:15.943 --> 01:50:18.069
What are we doing? Should we go?
Should I... I have the...

01:50:18.094 --> 01:50:18.802
Shh.

01:50:18.862 --> 01:50:23.366
Just relax, okay? Just be mellow, 'cause
that's what this is all about.

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:25.493
Because if it gets too stressful in here,

01:50:25.577 --> 01:50:27.995
then the baby is born into a
stressful environment,

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.250
and then he's wired for stress
for the rest of his life. So just...

01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:35.795
Just be calm.

01:50:35.879 --> 01:50:37.046
Okay.

01:50:38.257 --> 01:50:41.425
Okay, let's relax. Okay.

01:50:42.594 --> 01:50:43.719
Do you want to talk about things?

01:50:43.804 --> 01:50:46.055
I feel really bad about, like,
a lot of the shit I did.

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:47.598
I can't believe
I said some of that.

01:50:47.724 --> 01:50:48.975
That's all I think about
in my head.

01:50:49.059 --> 01:50:50.351
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:50:50.435 --> 01:50:54.021
But maybe we could bring the baby
into a reconciled place so we can talk...

01:50:54.106 --> 01:50:56.357
No. I don't wanna go there.

01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:59.694
Don't go there. Okay?
Help me stay relaxed.

01:50:59.778 --> 01:51:01.821
So, what should I do?

01:51:01.905 --> 01:51:03.447
You need to call Dr. Howard.

01:51:04.616 --> 01:51:05.700
<i>Hello?</i>

01:51:05.784 --> 01:51:10.788
Hello, yes, this is Ben Stone. I'm
calling on behalf of Allison Scott.

01:51:10.914 --> 01:51:12.540
<i>We need Dr. Howard.
It's an emergency.</i>

01:51:12.624 --> 01:51:15.209
Yeah. He's at San Francisco
at bar mitzvah.

01:51:15.294 --> 01:51:18.671
He's at a bar mitzvah in San Francisco?
Do you know when he gets back?

01:51:18.755 --> 01:51:20.298
<i>In three days.</i>

01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:23.467
Do you have his cell number,
by any chance?

01:51:26.763 --> 01:51:29.849
Hey! Good news.

01:51:29.933 --> 01:51:32.810
I got his number right here.
I'm gonna call him right now.

01:51:32.936 --> 01:51:36.063
Oh, great. Thank you so much. Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're here. Thank you.

01:51:36.148 --> 01:51:38.900
I'm glad I'm here, too.
Thank you.

01:51:38.984 --> 01:51:40.693
I shouldn't have told you
you were a fucking lunatic.

01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:43.112
I shouldn't have said that.
I feel terrible about it and...

01:51:43.238 --> 01:51:46.032
No, it's okay. We're past it.
We're past it.

01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:47.636
I'm sorry I told you
to fuck your bong.

01:51:47.701 --> 01:51:50.077
It's okay. I didn't.

01:51:50.162 --> 01:51:53.164
Let's just drop it now.
We're over it.

01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:56.375
I'm gonna call him right now.
You're doing so great.

01:51:56.460 --> 01:52:00.546
<i>Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here
right now. Please leave a message.</i>

01:52:00.631 --> 01:52:04.258
Hey, Doc Howard.
Ben Stone calling.

01:52:04.343 --> 01:52:06.260
Guess what the fuck's up?

01:52:06.345 --> 01:52:09.305
Allison's going into labor and
you are not fucking here.

01:52:09.431 --> 01:52:12.808
Now, where are you? You're at
a fucking bar mitzvah in San Francisco,

01:52:12.935 --> 01:52:14.894
you motherfucking piece of shit!

01:52:14.978 --> 01:52:16.270
And you know what I'm gonna have to do now?

01:52:16.355 --> 01:52:17.480
I'm gonna have to kill you.

01:52:17.606 --> 01:52:19.982
I'm gonna have to pop a fucking
cap in your ass.

01:52:20.108 --> 01:52:21.817
You're dead! You're Tupac!

01:52:21.944 --> 01:52:23.903
You are fucking Biggie,
you piece of shit!

01:52:23.987 --> 01:52:25.196
I hope you fucking die

01:52:25.322 --> 01:52:28.449
or drop the fucking chair
and kill that fucking kid!

01:52:28.533 --> 01:52:30.993
Hope your plane crashes.
Peace, fucker!

01:52:37.668 --> 01:52:38.918
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:40.086
Did you talk to him?

01:52:40.170 --> 01:52:44.674
I didn't talk to him directly. I left him
a very nice message, though.

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.426
And... Okay.

01:52:47.511 --> 01:52:50.096
What I'm about to tell you
isn't that bad.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:51.722
You should know that going in.

01:52:51.807 --> 01:52:54.684
We can get through this,
and it's just a little hiccough,

01:52:54.810 --> 01:52:56.170
but everything will be fine. Okay?

01:52:56.186 --> 01:52:58.521
Do you trust me when I say
everything will be fine?

01:52:58.647 --> 01:53:01.023
- I can deal with it.
- Okay.

01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:04.860
So, Dr. Howard is at a bar mitzvah.

01:53:04.987 --> 01:53:06.278
A bar mitzvah?

01:53:06.363 --> 01:53:07.989
It's a Jewish rite of passage.

01:53:08.073 --> 01:53:11.659
And he's gonna be there
for the next three days,

01:53:11.743 --> 01:53:15.037
so he will not be able
to be here tonight.

01:53:15.163 --> 01:53:16.414
Oh, no.

01:53:18.417 --> 01:53:19.917
It's okay.

01:53:21.044 --> 01:53:22.169
What do you think we should do?

01:53:22.254 --> 01:53:23.587
Okay. I know exactly what to do.

01:53:23.672 --> 01:53:26.382
All we do is we'll get in the car,
I'll drive to the hospital,

01:53:26.508 --> 01:53:29.135
and on the way, we will call every
gynecologist we've met.

01:53:29.219 --> 01:53:32.138
Someone will be available.
You know?

01:53:32.222 --> 01:53:34.140
- Okay. I can do that.
- Okay. Good.

01:53:34.224 --> 01:53:37.064
I mean, we still have time. I mean,
how far apart are your contractions?

01:53:37.102 --> 01:53:39.770
I think, like, seven minutes.
Seven minutes!

01:53:39.896 --> 01:53:41.981
See? Not until four minutes
is it really coming.

01:53:42.065 --> 01:53:43.816
And has your water broken, even?

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:46.152
I don't know. I'm in the tub.

01:53:46.236 --> 01:53:48.529
That's a good point. Have you had
your bloody show?

01:53:48.613 --> 01:53:49.822
What? What's that?

01:53:49.906 --> 01:53:52.491
It's, it's... I mean, it's a bloody
mucusy discharge.

01:53:52.576 --> 01:53:54.869
But it only comes out right before
the baby's gonna come,

01:53:54.953 --> 01:53:56.787
so if that hasn't happened,
we have time.

01:53:56.913 --> 01:53:59.665
We can make it to the hospital.
It's no problem.

01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:01.876
You read the baby books.

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:05.546
Yeah. I did. I read three
of them, actually.

01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:07.631
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:54:11.303 --> 01:54:13.429
Hey. Hey, you okay?

01:54:16.558 --> 01:54:17.767
Okay.

01:54:22.606 --> 01:54:24.982
Wait. Are we allowed to park here?

01:54:25.108 --> 01:54:28.819
It's okay. I stole this
from Martin's grandma.

01:54:28.945 --> 01:54:31.822
- Oh, that was really sweet of you.
- Thanks.

01:54:33.325 --> 01:54:36.494
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.621
Okay. Inches away.

01:54:38.747 --> 01:54:40.706
- Okay.
- We're close.

01:54:40.791 --> 01:54:45.169
Home stretch. Hello. This is Allison Scott.

01:54:45.295 --> 01:54:47.296
Dr. Kuni said he would let you
know we were coming?

01:54:47.422 --> 01:54:49.965
- Oh, he did. We'll take good care of you.
- Okay.

01:54:50.092 --> 01:54:51.217
- Samuel?
- Yeah?

01:54:51.301 --> 01:54:54.678
This is Allison Scott. Please admit
her into Room 307.

01:54:54.805 --> 01:54:55.846
Hi.

01:54:55.931 --> 01:54:57.223
Hey.

01:54:57.307 --> 01:54:58.808
You're our nurse?

01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:01.936
That's why I'm holding
the clipboard.

01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:05.397
So, what else is up
with you guys?

01:55:05.482 --> 01:55:08.192
I'm just joking. Let's have a baby, huh?

01:55:08.276 --> 01:55:09.360
Yeah.

01:55:11.154 --> 01:55:14.073
Jeez, I'm sorry it took me so long
to find that vein.

01:55:14.157 --> 01:55:18.160
That little guy really didn't
want me to find him.

01:55:18.245 --> 01:55:20.079
Is that the baby on that
one right there?

01:55:20.163 --> 01:55:21.247
Yeah.

01:55:21.331 --> 01:55:23.582
So we can tell how the little
guy or gal is doing.

01:55:23.667 --> 01:55:24.917
Okay.

01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:29.255
Hello, Allison. Ben.
Interesting night.

01:55:29.339 --> 01:55:31.298
We really, really appreciate
you coming, man.

01:55:31.383 --> 01:55:35.302
What else do I have to do, I mean,
besides sleep? Totally kidding.

01:55:35.387 --> 01:55:36.720
What happened to your doctor?

01:55:36.805 --> 01:55:38.848
He's at a bar mitzvah
in San Francisco.

01:55:38.932 --> 01:55:40.558
He didn't tell us, though.

01:55:40.684 --> 01:55:41.809
- Nice.
- Yeah.

01:55:41.893 --> 01:55:45.396
Lucky for you, I don't have
any Jewish friends.

01:55:45.522 --> 01:55:48.482
Dr. Kuni, I really wanna do this
naturally. I don't wanna use drugs.

01:55:48.567 --> 01:55:52.153
Okay, let's just take a look
and see what happens, okay?

01:55:52.237 --> 01:55:54.530
Foetal heart rate is good.
Samuel, where are we?

01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:57.533
- Four centimeters.
- Four centimeters what?

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:59.785
- Dilated?
- Dilated. That's right. Focus.

01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:02.371
Pay attention, okay?
We're a team. Okay?

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:05.791
I wanna get the fuck out of here.

01:56:05.876 --> 01:56:06.959
What?

01:56:07.043 --> 01:56:08.335
I just wanna get the fuck out of here.

01:56:08.336 --> 01:56:10.087
Okay. Just relax,
man, just relax.

01:56:10.213 --> 01:56:11.797
Oh, man, I don't fucking
like hospitals.

01:56:11.882 --> 01:56:14.341
I know, but, Jonah,
this is beautiful.

01:56:14.426 --> 01:56:19.722
I just think you need to relax and embrace
the beauty of another life joining our gang.

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:22.266
We're having a baby.
We are having a baby.

01:56:22.392 --> 01:56:25.102
I'm not having shit besides
a fucking panic attack.

01:56:25.228 --> 01:56:29.481
There's probably a fucking room
back there full of dead bodies!

01:56:29.566 --> 01:56:31.275
You guys wanna be here
when one rolls out

01:56:31.401 --> 01:56:34.069
and just fucking coughs
malaria into our face?

01:56:35.447 --> 01:56:36.739
- Jesus.
- Fucking shit.

01:56:38.074 --> 01:56:40.618
- Is that good?
- Oh, yeah.

01:56:40.744 --> 01:56:43.412
Oh, yeah, get in there.

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:44.580
I could do this all day.

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:45.789
Cool.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.835
- What was that?
- What the hell was that?

01:56:54.591 --> 01:56:56.842
What's happening?

01:56:56.927 --> 01:56:59.053
Well, boys and girls, what
seems to be the problem?

01:56:59.137 --> 01:57:01.055
- Decels.
- Oh, dear.

01:57:01.139 --> 01:57:04.099
Okay, Allison, I need you to
turn on your back now, okay?

01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:06.727
The baby's heart rate
is slowing. Okay?

01:57:06.811 --> 01:57:08.395
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:11.106
- It's gonna be fine. Is it gonna be fine?
- It's gonna be fine. Okay?

01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:15.402
You'll feel a little bit of a push.
You'll feel a little bit of...

01:57:15.487 --> 01:57:17.446
- Oh.
- What are you doing?

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:21.700
I'm turning the baby so I can take
the pressure off the cord. Okay?

01:57:21.785 --> 01:57:23.953
Oh, my God.

01:57:24.037 --> 01:57:25.204
Okay, we're good.

01:57:25.288 --> 01:57:27.206
The heartbeat's stronger, but we're
not out of the woods.

01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:28.666
We need to get things going now.

01:57:28.792 --> 01:57:31.043
I think the cord is wrapped
around the neck.

01:57:31.127 --> 01:57:34.127
So I'm gonna give you some medicine,
pop the bag and get things going, okay?

01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:35.970
I don't wanna leave the baby
in there for long,

01:57:36.007 --> 01:57:37.508
and we can give you
some medicine for the pain.

01:57:37.634 --> 01:57:39.134
No, no, no, no.

01:57:39.219 --> 01:57:41.579
I don't... I don't want the baby to
be born all drugged out.

01:57:41.638 --> 01:57:42.930
It's not my birth plan.

01:57:43.014 --> 01:57:44.932
Now, things change. We don't
have time to debate this.

01:57:45.016 --> 01:57:48.269
What? No. But no, I'm not
comfortable with that. I'm not.

01:57:48.353 --> 01:57:50.229
No. Would you please
just listen to her?

01:57:50.313 --> 01:57:52.398
Fine. Do what you want to do.

01:57:52.482 --> 01:57:54.692
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
- Should I leave?

01:57:54.818 --> 01:57:57.444
Do you want to be the doctor?
Because I really don't need to be here.

01:57:57.529 --> 01:58:00.209
No. What we want is to take a second
to talk about our options, okay?

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.324
- That's all we want.
- No. You mean you want to take a second

01:58:02.409 --> 01:58:03.909
to tell me how to do my job.

01:58:03.994 --> 01:58:06.954
My job is to get that baby out safely.

01:58:07.038 --> 01:58:10.374
Or I can go home. Just let me know.
You be the doctor.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.876
Can we talk outside in the
hall for a second?

01:58:13.503 --> 01:58:15.087
That woman is a control freak,

01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:17.923
and she needs to let go and
let me do my job.

01:58:18.008 --> 01:58:19.368
Look, she's just having
a hard time

01:58:19.384 --> 01:58:22.136
because her and our doctor had
a very specific birth plan.

01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:24.763
And they wanted it to be
a very special experience.

01:58:24.848 --> 01:58:27.683
If you want a special experience,
go to a Jimmy Buffett concert.

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:31.353
We have a new birth plan.
Get the baby out safely.

01:58:31.438 --> 01:58:36.483
Look, man, will you help us out?
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:58:36.568 --> 01:58:40.571
You can be as big a dick to me as you
want. Just be nice to her, man.

01:58:40.697 --> 01:58:43.615
That's all I ask. Just please
be nice to her.

01:58:49.873 --> 01:58:51.165
Are you okay?

01:58:51.249 --> 01:58:53.125
I think so.

01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:55.169
I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.

01:58:55.253 --> 01:58:56.795
Thank you, man. Thanks.

01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:00.215
This is healthy. This is good.
I think we're bonding.

01:59:07.891 --> 01:59:13.437
Allison, I apologize for being a little
brash, but if you're okay with it,

01:59:13.563 --> 01:59:15.189
it's rather important
we break the bag

01:59:15.273 --> 01:59:17.524
and give you some medicine
to speed things up.

01:59:17.609 --> 01:59:21.528
Because once the bag is broken,
I don't want there to be an infection.

01:59:21.613 --> 01:59:24.114
Whatever. Do what you have to do.

01:59:27.744 --> 01:59:31.330
Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy is.

01:59:31.414 --> 01:59:33.707
I know, I know. Look, I talked to him.

01:59:33.792 --> 01:59:36.502
I think he'll be more cool now.

01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:41.465
I'm so sorry I broke up with you.

01:59:42.342 --> 01:59:44.009
You really don't need to be.

01:59:44.094 --> 01:59:47.262
And, you know, I knew you'd
give me another shot.

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:51.767
I figured it'd be a lot sooner
than this, you know?

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:55.145
I was just in such a panic
from all of this.

01:59:55.271 --> 01:59:59.525
And watching Debbie
and Pete together, it's...

01:59:59.609 --> 02:00:01.693
- And my ass got so fat.
- No, no.

02:00:01.778 --> 02:00:03.070
It did.

02:00:03.154 --> 02:00:06.615
I just never, for one minute, thought that
the guy who got me pregnant

02:00:06.699 --> 02:00:09.493
would actually be the right guy for me.

02:00:09.994 --> 02:00:11.703
- Me, either.
- I guess he is.

02:00:11.788 --> 02:00:12.871
Yeah.

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:18.127
All right, Martin, who am I?

02:00:20.171 --> 02:00:25.217
"People think I'm smart because
I speak in a robot voice."

02:00:25.301 --> 02:00:26.885
Stephen Hawking.

02:00:26.970 --> 02:00:31.849
"I fuck my nurse with my
ever-expanding cock."

02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:36.228
All right. Let's murderball.

02:00:36.312 --> 02:00:38.897
Come here! I'm gonna murderball you!

02:00:38.982 --> 02:00:40.342
- Stay down!
- Jonah, you shithead!

02:00:41.985 --> 02:00:43.110
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:00:43.194 --> 02:00:44.361
Hi.

02:00:44.487 --> 02:00:46.488
I can't believe I go out of
town and this happens.

02:00:46.573 --> 02:00:49.158
I know. I'm sorry, but I'm
not going anywhere.

02:00:49.242 --> 02:00:50.909
- Screw Legoland.
- All right.

02:00:50.994 --> 02:00:53.314
Hey, how do you want this?
You want this over the shoulder?

02:00:53.329 --> 02:00:55.569
You know, I can do whatever
you want. I can get in there.

02:00:55.582 --> 02:00:57.040
Kind of Spike Lee angles.

02:00:57.167 --> 02:01:00.169
No, you can shoot the waiting
room. That would be great.

02:01:00.253 --> 02:01:05.174
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you.
I've got it from here.

02:01:05.884 --> 02:01:06.925
Debbie.

02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:09.011
Can I talk to you in the hall
for a second?

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.262
Why?

02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:16.560
I'd like to be in there with
Allison, without you.

02:01:16.686 --> 02:01:17.978
Okay.

02:01:18.062 --> 02:01:22.483
I understand how you feel
but this isn't up to you.

02:01:22.567 --> 02:01:27.946
Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass
if you think you're coming into that room.

02:01:28.031 --> 02:01:31.033
If you take one step towards
that door, I will tell security

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:34.495
there's a crazy chick in a pink
dress snatching up babies. Okay?

02:01:34.579 --> 02:01:38.415
So don't even try to come into
that room. That's my room now.

02:01:38.541 --> 02:01:41.668
That little area with the Pepsi
machine, that's your area.

02:01:41.753 --> 02:01:46.465
My room. Your area. Stay in your area.
Stay out of my room.

02:01:46.549 --> 02:01:49.218
Back the fuck off.

02:01:58.394 --> 02:02:00.479
What are you doing here?

02:02:00.563 --> 02:02:03.565
He just kicked me out.
He told me to leave.

02:02:05.902 --> 02:02:06.902
Oh.

02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:10.405
But I guess it's good, right?

02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:12.741
He said he's gonna
take care of her.

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:15.202
He really seems on his game.

02:02:15.286 --> 02:02:17.955
I think he's gonna be a good dad.

02:02:18.081 --> 02:02:20.165
I think I like him.

02:02:20.250 --> 02:02:21.667
Thank God.

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:26.964
I wish I'd gotten that on tape.

02:02:28.299 --> 02:02:31.218
Go! Holy shit, almighty!

02:02:31.302 --> 02:02:33.470
Oh, shit, this really hurts!

02:02:33.596 --> 02:02:35.472
- I see we're well on our way.
- Okay.

02:02:35.598 --> 02:02:37.808
I want the... I want the epidural. Okay?

02:02:37.934 --> 02:02:39.559
- Give me the epidural!
- Give her the epidural, okay?

02:02:39.644 --> 02:02:41.186
- Give it to her now.
- Okay, Allison.

02:02:41.271 --> 02:02:45.065
We're past the point of an epidural.
Okay? The cervix is fully dilated.

02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:48.151
No, seriously, I want an epidural!
I know there's time!

02:02:48.278 --> 02:02:50.279
- We can't give you the epidural.
- Take the time! I...

02:02:50.363 --> 02:02:52.948
I'll make sure it doesn't come out!
I'll stop pushing.

02:02:53.032 --> 02:02:54.199
- We have time.
- Just do it, please!

02:02:54.284 --> 02:02:55.764
- I'll stop.
- Please, please, please!

02:02:55.785 --> 02:02:57.202
I'm sorry. We have no time.

02:02:57.287 --> 02:02:59.913
We're gonna just have to do
this the all-natural way, okay?

02:02:59.998 --> 02:03:01.707
The way you wanted to do it.

02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:03.458
- Okay? Ready?
- Okay.

02:03:03.543 --> 02:03:08.046
Here comes another contraction, okay?
I want you to push. Okay, ready?

02:03:09.299 --> 02:03:11.550
- Good, good, good.
- I feel everything!

02:03:11.634 --> 02:03:13.302
Oh, my God! It's happening!

02:03:13.386 --> 02:03:15.762
Okay, maybe we can
take it down just a little.

02:03:15.847 --> 02:03:17.597
I think you're gonna scare
the other pregnant women.

02:03:17.682 --> 02:03:19.641
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Okay.

02:03:19.726 --> 02:03:21.059
Are you kidding me?

02:03:23.396 --> 02:03:24.521
Jesus.

02:03:25.523 --> 02:03:27.691
This is messed up. Something's
wrong in there.

02:03:27.817 --> 02:03:28.984
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, no.

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:30.819
I mean, granted, gynecology's
only a hobby of mine,

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:33.155
but it sounds to me like she's
crowning. Is that right, Deb?

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:34.698
Yeah. That's what it sounds
like for everyone.

02:03:34.824 --> 02:03:36.450
Everyone goes through this.

02:03:36.534 --> 02:03:40.329
No, I disagree with you.
That sounds terrible.

02:03:41.998 --> 02:03:44.499
I'm gonna go sneak a peak,
see if there's anything I can do.

02:03:49.505 --> 02:03:51.423
Okay! It's crowning!
I'm seeing the head!

02:03:51.507 --> 02:03:52.674
Oh, God.

02:03:52.759 --> 02:03:54.801
- What does it look like, Ben?
- Oh, God.

02:03:54.886 --> 02:03:56.386
- What?
- You don't wanna see it.

02:03:56.512 --> 02:03:58.805
- No, I wanna see it!
- It's beautiful. You don't want to, though.

02:03:58.890 --> 02:04:01.725
- No, I want to see it!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

02:04:01.851 --> 02:04:04.436
Okay, we're almost home!
One, two...

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:06.855
You okay in here? Jesus!

02:04:06.939 --> 02:04:09.149
- Get out!
- Yeah, okay.

02:04:09.233 --> 02:04:10.317
Oh, no!

02:04:13.529 --> 02:04:15.405
You all right, buddy?

02:04:16.532 --> 02:04:17.783
It's okay.

02:04:19.744 --> 02:04:20.952
What did it look like?

02:04:21.037 --> 02:04:22.621
I shouldn't have gone in there.

02:04:22.705 --> 02:04:25.248
Don't go in there. Promise me
you don't go in there.

02:04:25.375 --> 02:04:27.918
Me, go in there? That's the last
fucking place I wanna go.

02:04:28.044 --> 02:04:29.461
Like I'm gonna go in there.

02:04:29.545 --> 02:04:31.171
Try getting a boner now.

02:04:31.255 --> 02:04:32.631
What's up, Deb?

02:04:32.715 --> 02:04:33.840
Hey.

02:04:36.928 --> 02:04:40.680
- Push. One, two, three.
- Oh, God!

02:04:40.765 --> 02:04:44.059
You've passed the shoulders.
One more big push.

02:04:45.728 --> 02:04:47.104
Good.

02:04:52.944 --> 02:04:54.152
I did it.

02:04:54.237 --> 02:04:57.030
- Okay. Oh, my God. It's out.
- You did it. You did it.

02:04:57.115 --> 02:04:59.491
- Oh, my God, you did it.
- Oh, my God.

02:05:02.787 --> 02:05:04.162
Oh, God.

02:05:06.749 --> 02:05:09.376
- I love you, Ben.
- I love you so much, too.

02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:10.544
Oh, my God.

02:05:10.670 --> 02:05:13.338
- Congratulations, you two. Beautiful.
- Thank you.

02:05:13.423 --> 02:05:16.967
- You did so great. You were amazing.
- Thank you.

02:05:17.093 --> 02:05:19.469
Okay, pretty baby.

02:05:19.554 --> 02:05:21.179
You got out.

02:05:21.264 --> 02:05:23.765
You made it out. Welcome.

02:05:25.935 --> 02:05:28.979
You ever get so bored you
just stare at your balls?

02:05:29.105 --> 02:05:31.440
I bet you do, late John Lennon.

02:05:34.110 --> 02:05:35.235
Here we are again.

02:05:35.319 --> 02:05:37.279
Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi?

02:05:37.363 --> 02:05:39.531
Is he the one who cuts the penis?

02:05:41.033 --> 02:05:42.951
I think it's Matisyahu.

02:05:44.203 --> 02:05:45.454
Awesome.

02:05:45.538 --> 02:05:47.664
- You want out of the bet?
- I want out of the bet.

02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:52.752
You know what you have to say. Just
say it, man. I think now is the time.

02:05:52.837 --> 02:05:55.422
Jason, you're the master.

02:05:55.506 --> 02:05:56.798
- You heard it, right?
- Yeah.

02:05:56.883 --> 02:05:59.468
All right. You're out of the bet.
Yeah, now you're done.

02:05:59.552 --> 02:06:01.386
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, God.

02:06:01.471 --> 02:06:03.430
Your face smells like an old man's balls.

02:06:03.514 --> 02:06:05.307
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Oh, fucking hell.

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.351
Hey.

02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:15.192
Oh, my God.

02:06:15.318 --> 02:06:17.194
Oh, hello.

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:19.321
Oh, my goodness.

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:22.574
She's beautiful.

02:06:25.203 --> 02:06:26.786
Hello.

02:06:26.871 --> 02:06:29.664
- Oh. I love you, Ben.
- I love you, Debbie.

02:06:29.749 --> 02:06:33.460
We're gonna have another baby.
Okay.

02:06:33.544 --> 02:06:34.878
Hello, baby.

02:06:35.004 --> 02:06:36.963
Gentlemen, it's a girl!

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:43.386
We got a daughter! Mazel tov!

02:06:43.513 --> 02:06:46.264
- Congratulations, Daddy!
- We got a beautiful little girl!

02:06:46.349 --> 02:06:49.351
- Let's meet her! She's awesome!
- A beautiful little girl!

02:06:50.019 --> 02:06:53.188
And then your mommy said,
"Just do it, already,"

02:06:54.065 --> 02:06:56.733
which was very confusing
to Daddy.

02:06:56.859 --> 02:07:01.196
So I listened to the most literal translation
of that and I just did it, already.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.156
What would you do?

02:07:03.241 --> 02:07:04.866
Don't tell Mommy,

02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:09.162
but it was the smartest thing I ever did,
listening to her, 'cause now you're here.

02:07:09.247 --> 02:07:11.998
- Isn't that nice?
- I think it is.

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:19.214
Hi, you.

02:07:23.386 --> 02:07:25.586
I hope your apartment is big enough
for the three of us.

02:07:25.596 --> 02:07:27.097
Oh, it definitely is.

02:07:27.223 --> 02:07:30.058
That's why I got one in East LA,
the rent. It's huge!

02:07:30.142 --> 02:07:31.542
The only thing is we have to decide

02:07:31.561 --> 02:07:33.895
if we're gonna be Crips or Bloods
before we get there.

02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:36.439
Well, I look good in red.
I look good in blue.

02:07:36.566 --> 02:07:37.816
The fighting continues.

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:41.518
We could just throw off everyone
and become Latin Kings.

02:07:41.571 --> 02:07:42.654
Yeah.

02:07:42.738 --> 02:07:43.947
We both look good in gold.

02:07:44.031 --> 02:07:45.365
Yeah.

02:07:46.409 --> 02:07:47.659
Good choice.

02:07:47.743 --> 02:07:51.288
I would yell at you about driving
so slow, except the baby's here.

02:07:51.414 --> 02:07:54.833
No, these guys can honk all they want.
I ain't going faster than 12.

02:07:54.917 --> 02:07:57.117
It might take us around three
hours to get home, though.
