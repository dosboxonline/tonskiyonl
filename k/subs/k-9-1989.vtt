02:18.446 --> 02:21.779
Great. You think that's funny, chiphead?

02:21.866 --> 02:26.327
You know, I could pull your battery
and kill you. so don't get cocky.

02:32.585 --> 02:36.368
- 2707 to ControI.
- Control, 2707.

02:36.463 --> 02:39.417
Message check. I'm waitin'
for a friendly named Freddie.

02:39.508 --> 02:42.959
He's a no-show.
Is there any call-ins from him?

02:43.053 --> 02:46.256
Control, 2707. No messages.

02:46.348 --> 02:49.432
All right, ten-four. I have a request
to open a phone channeI.

02:49.518 --> 02:52.305
Patch me through to 5553312, please.

02:54.522 --> 02:58.390
Calling your girlfriend to say you'll be late
is nonessential communication.

02:58.484 --> 03:01.319
You should know that
by now, 2707. Clear.

03:03.531 --> 03:07.196
Clear. Ten-four.
Thanks for nothing, ControI.

03:19.088 --> 03:21.080
Ah, this is great

03:21.757 --> 03:24.082
Agh! Goddamn it.

03:26.678 --> 03:28.884
Lovers' lane.

03:29.556 --> 03:31.548
Hi! Police.

03:31.641 --> 03:34.346
This is an emergency.
I have to use your phone.

03:34.436 --> 03:38.303
sorry about the upholstery. Just pretend
I'm not here, OK? I'll be a second.

03:38.398 --> 03:40.437
$100 bottle of champagne!

03:41.192 --> 03:44.810
she's worth it.
Aw, damn, the machine's on, you know?

03:44.904 --> 03:46.528
You have one? I hate them.

03:46.614 --> 03:50.197
You got a Kleenex? Ah, forget it.
That's all right. This'll come off.

03:50.284 --> 03:54.863
Ah. Hi, Tracy. Yeah, it's Dooley.

03:54.955 --> 03:57.826
I'm just calling to let you know
I'm gonna be a little late.

03:57.916 --> 03:58.912
What's that?

04:03.547 --> 04:04.792
I gotta go, honey.

04:19.771 --> 04:22.937
Well, it's not the Eyewitness News team.

04:34.660 --> 04:36.403
I think someone's mad at me.

04:42.501 --> 04:44.992
Definitely, someone is mad at me.

04:53.220 --> 04:55.545
- Whoo!
- Hey, Dooley!

04:55.639 --> 04:58.176
Got a ride home tonight?

05:00.185 --> 05:03.304
- Byers, I need a car.
- Can I ask you something?

05:03.396 --> 05:07.939
- Later. Please, I need a car. Mine blew up.
- Just one question. One question.

05:08.025 --> 05:11.192
How many cops use their day off
tryin' to get their asses shot off?

05:11.279 --> 05:13.948
- I was set up!
- How many?

05:14.031 --> 05:17.898
Look, I got him, OK?
I'm this close, Rog. I got Lyman.

05:17.993 --> 05:20.745
- Give me a number. I'll write it down.
- 50 million.

05:20.829 --> 05:24.412
Lyman's moving 50 million.
This is the big one, Rog, and I got him.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.955
Mike, you don't have dick on Lyman.
What you've got

05:27.044 --> 05:29.961
is a wet suit,
a bad attitude and a blown-up car.

05:30.047 --> 05:32.372
Right. That's what I told you. I need a car.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.135
You want a car, take a partner.
It's a two-for-one deaI.

05:35.218 --> 05:37.376
- No, I'm not takin' a partner.
- Take Davis.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.341
- Davis hates me.
- OK, uh... spencer. How about spencer?

05:40.432 --> 05:43.101
- I hate spencer.
- You know the roster. Pick somebody.

05:43.184 --> 05:45.853
- Lydecker. He's a good man.
- Lydecker's dead.

05:46.270 --> 05:49.141
That's why I like him.
Doesn't slow me down.

05:49.232 --> 05:52.351
Rog. 50 million. 50 million and Lyman.

05:52.443 --> 05:56.820
50 million? Listen, smartass. How do you
know that there's a shipment comin' in?

05:56.906 --> 06:00.606
High-tuned cop sense.
You remember that, Rog.

06:02.369 --> 06:04.528
That's what you used to have, remember?

06:04.621 --> 06:07.408
Before you became
a paper-pushin' pansy.

06:08.292 --> 06:11.707
Paper-pushin' pansy. I like it.
Can you say it five times reaI quick?

06:11.795 --> 06:14.037
- Paper-pushin' pansy...
- You're pathetic.

06:14.131 --> 06:16.419
You're jealous because
I made lieutenant first.

06:16.508 --> 06:20.208
You're right. You're right.
I'm green with envy because

06:20.303 --> 06:24.087
I'd love to spend my days here with my
lips locked to the commissioner's butt!

06:24.182 --> 06:26.673
- screw you, Dooley!
- Right now, Roger. Come on!

06:26.768 --> 06:28.926
- Don't push me!
- Take your best shot!

06:32.398 --> 06:35.849
You did. You hit me.

06:36.736 --> 06:38.693
I don't believe you hit me.

06:41.115 --> 06:43.107
- Do I get the car?
- You'll take a partner?

06:43.200 --> 06:44.196
- No.
- No car.

06:44.284 --> 06:46.443
OK. Fine.

06:46.537 --> 06:48.825
I don't need your help.

06:48.914 --> 06:50.906
I'll take Lyman alone.

07:20.736 --> 07:22.729
Honey?

07:23.697 --> 07:25.690
sweetheart!

07:29.578 --> 07:31.570
shit.

07:33.373 --> 07:35.366
Trace.

07:36.126 --> 07:38.831
Trace, I know you're mad.
You have every right to be.

07:38.920 --> 07:42.004
I know tonight
was supposed to be speciaI.

07:42.090 --> 07:45.790
I mean, the wine, the garlic chicken,
which is my favourite,

07:45.885 --> 07:49.634
scalloped potatoes, the peas...

07:49.722 --> 07:52.925
The peas. Even though I hate peas.

07:53.017 --> 07:56.884
They're good for me
and that shows me that you care, honey.

07:56.979 --> 08:00.562
I know I'm three hours late.
I am. And, uh...

08:00.649 --> 08:02.642
- Well, what can I say?
- Hi.

08:02.735 --> 08:04.526
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:04.612 --> 08:06.853
- Hi.
- This is Chad, Mike.

08:06.947 --> 08:09.355
- Chad?
- Yes, Chad.

08:09.449 --> 08:11.822
- A friend from work. Works for Pan Am.
- Uh-huh.

08:11.910 --> 08:14.235
One of those, uh,
baggage-handler kinda guys?

08:14.329 --> 08:17.034
No, more like
one of those pilot kinda guys.

08:17.124 --> 08:20.907
Honey, you're a book editor.
How did you meet smilin' Jack here?

08:21.002 --> 08:23.576
Well, he, um...
has also written three best sellers.

08:23.671 --> 08:28.464
- Books? Manuals? Instructions?
- Look, I've got an early flight tomorrow.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.544
- Maybe I...
- Thanks for the movie, Chad.

08:30.636 --> 08:34.301
Any time. We'll have dinner when I get
back from Hong Kong. The three of us.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.679
- Wow. What a night that'll be.
- Good night.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.101
- Good night.
- Good night, Chad.

08:40.813 --> 08:44.015
- You're dating? That was a date?
- He's a friend. We went to the movies.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.017
- Do me a favour.
- Mike.

08:46.110 --> 08:50.818
Do me a favour. When you go to the
movies, go to the movies with ugly guys.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.982
Ugly guys with shitty jobs.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.325
- You have a shitty job.
- That's right. see what I mean?

08:56.411 --> 09:00.740
so we're perfect for each other.
Why didn't you wait for me?

09:00.832 --> 09:03.952
Because if I lived my life
around your schedule, I'd go nuts.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.451
I'd be a clock-tower sniper in a month.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.752
It's hard enough,
knowing that making a bust

09:08.840 --> 09:11.295
is more important to you
than making time for me.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.678
Now, I love you, Mike, but I can't
count on you, so I do what I have to do.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.217
Eat your peas. They're good for you.

09:20.309 --> 09:23.808
- You know, I'm onto something big.
- You always are.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.138
It's Lyman. I think I got him scared.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.609
- He tried to kill me tonight.
- Just what I wanted to hear.

09:29.693 --> 09:32.184
- I feeI so much better now
- Look, look.

09:32.279 --> 09:34.734
What do you want me to say, honey?
I'll say it.

09:34.823 --> 09:37.824
It's not what you say.
I know what's important to you.

09:37.909 --> 09:42.286
It's not me. It's the next bust or the next
shipment or south American cheeseball.

09:42.372 --> 09:47.117
Now, I know that. And I either have to deaI
with that or find some other way to live.

09:47.210 --> 09:52.085
All right. Look.
If you hate it so much, just move out.

09:52.173 --> 09:55.174
Just take your shoes and move out.

09:55.676 --> 09:57.965
I own this house. You moved in with me.

10:00.681 --> 10:02.674
That's right. That's right.

10:03.893 --> 10:09.135
I was wondering how I could afford
such a nice place. It's really... so tastefuI.

10:09.231 --> 10:11.936
- It's very nice. You did a very nice job.
- Mike...

10:12.025 --> 10:15.525
Forget it for now. I know
verbaI skills aren't your strong point.

10:15.612 --> 10:18.447
- What are my strong points?
- No, not those either.

10:18.532 --> 10:20.524
- You're a liar.
- You're a bragger.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.580
Hello. Dooley.

10:33.921 --> 10:35.961
Got an address on Freddie, huh?

10:36.048 --> 10:38.041
No, give it to me.

10:39.135 --> 10:41.127
Uh-huh.

10:42.805 --> 10:45.972
No, no. No black-and-whites.
I don't wanna scare him.

10:47.643 --> 10:50.134
Uh-huh.

10:50.229 --> 10:52.352
No, no.

10:55.442 --> 10:58.858
Oh, damn it. I missed it.

11:01.323 --> 11:03.315
God, I'm old.

11:20.591 --> 11:22.667
- Ernie. " Que pasa?
- Bitch of a night.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.927
- Why ain't you in bed with your old lady?
- Why aren't you?

11:26.013 --> 11:28.136
- Your pizza, man.
- Cheese and mushroom?

11:28.224 --> 11:31.011
- Like always.
- Here. seven, right?

11:31.101 --> 11:33.177
- Yeah.
- How about a napkin?

11:33.270 --> 11:35.263
How about a tip?

11:40.360 --> 11:42.353
Cold damn pizza.

11:45.907 --> 11:47.900
Gotta get a microwave in here.

11:53.414 --> 11:55.407
You just ran a stop sign!

12:24.986 --> 12:26.979
Good morning.

12:48.801 --> 12:53.546
- Hey! Freddie, my man!
- This can't be happening.

12:53.639 --> 12:56.426
- This can't be happening!
- You thought I was dead, huh?

12:56.517 --> 12:58.889
surprised to see me?
You set me up, Freddie.

12:58.977 --> 13:01.682
- I didn't do anything!
- Then what are you running from?

13:01.772 --> 13:04.013
I need the exercise.

13:04.107 --> 13:06.776
Exercise? I can help you there, Freddie.

13:06.860 --> 13:10.193
You know, this whole jogging thing,
I just don't get it.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.197
- Dooley, what the hell are you doing?
- But if you don't run,

13:13.283 --> 13:15.240
you miss the precious aerobic benefits.

13:15.326 --> 13:18.197
Make a right hand signaI for me,
will you? Thank you.

13:18.287 --> 13:20.245
- Freddie, listen.
- What are you doin'?

13:20.331 --> 13:22.787
- Names, Freddie. I need names.
- I don't know!

13:22.875 --> 13:25.200
- You are like Edwin Moses.
- Ah, come on.

13:25.294 --> 13:27.999
- Great hurdler. You know that?
- Come on, buddy!

13:28.089 --> 13:30.211
- No, no, no!
- To be the best, you gotta go!

13:30.299 --> 13:32.837
- Dooley!
- Come on, buddy. Up, up.

13:32.927 --> 13:36.675
- OK, OK. They were dealers.
- Dealers? Watch that pole!

13:36.764 --> 13:38.756
Don't wanna piss off AT&T!

13:39.516 --> 13:41.425
Don't do it!

13:41.518 --> 13:44.969
- Whoo! Names, Freddie.
- I don't know!

13:45.063 --> 13:47.388
- Was it Lyman?
- I don't know, I swear to you.

13:47.482 --> 13:52.061
Benny the Mule. He was the trigger man.
Jesus, Dooley, what are you doin'?

13:53.071 --> 13:55.740
Oh, you got those slim Italian shoes, huh?

13:57.158 --> 14:00.075
I think we qualify for a carpooI.

14:00.161 --> 14:03.281
Dooley, you're gonna kill me!
What are you doin'?

14:03.372 --> 14:06.077
All right! You busted
a big shipment of their coke.

14:06.167 --> 14:09.002
Now I wanna know,
are they movin' some more stuff in?

14:09.086 --> 14:12.585
- They're movin' a lot more in, aren't they?
- What?

14:12.673 --> 14:15.958
Huh? Come on,
give it to me straight, Freddie.

14:16.051 --> 14:19.254
- Come on. I want it straight.
- All right. All right.

14:20.347 --> 14:23.431
We had a meeting at a warehouse.

14:23.517 --> 14:27.597
Fifth and Presidio.
Transworld shipping, something like that.

14:27.687 --> 14:30.605
Better be right, buddy,
because I'm gonna tell you,

14:30.690 --> 14:33.940
I don't wanna waste
my afternoon searchin'.

14:34.027 --> 14:36.518
- You'll waste a lifetime searching it.
- Yeah?

14:36.946 --> 14:40.695
It's huge. You could hide
the Goodyear Blimp in there.

14:40.783 --> 14:43.488
- Better have a hell of a nose.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

14:43.578 --> 14:46.828
- I guess I'll have to.
- Hey, what am I supposed to do?

14:46.914 --> 14:49.203
Drive slow, don't pass.

14:54.129 --> 14:56.501
San Diego Police Department.

14:56.590 --> 14:59.295
Put your weapons down,
put your hands behind your head,

14:59.384 --> 15:02.718
and come out of the building
through the front door.

15:05.807 --> 15:08.844
This is Sergeant Young
of the San Diego Police Department.

15:13.898 --> 15:16.021
.. weapons down,
hands behind your head,

15:16.109 --> 15:19.312
and come out of the building
through the front door.

15:26.994 --> 15:30.612
- What's the deaI?
- We busted a buy down the block.

15:30.706 --> 15:33.707
They took off, we grabbed one of 'em,
the other two - in there.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.785
- Brannigan up there?
- Yeah.

15:41.925 --> 15:44.250
Hey, Brannigan. Brannigan!

15:46.596 --> 15:49.681
- Brannigan. Come here. I need a favour.
- I'm busy, Dooley.

15:49.766 --> 15:52.637
- I need one of your land sharks here.
- Hey, they got a gig.

15:52.727 --> 15:56.013
Hey, I only need it for a couple of hours.
Come on, gimme the dog.

15:56.106 --> 15:59.059
- I can't spare a handler.
- No handler? I'll do it myself.

15:59.150 --> 16:02.733
- These dogs won't listen to you.
- That's just because they don't know me.

16:02.820 --> 16:06.865
They don't have to know you. You're
a maniac. They don't trust maniacs.

16:06.949 --> 16:09.321
- Forget it.
- I got this sweet bust goin' down.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.616
But I need to jump on it right now.
I need the dog.

16:11.704 --> 16:15.286
You think you have problems?
I gotta take my wife and kids on vacation.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.328
- I got a plane to catch in three hours.
- Plane?

16:18.419 --> 16:21.123
Yeah. But I won't catch it
cos I gotta wait for the sWAT.

16:21.213 --> 16:24.297
- If I get you on the plane, I get the dog?
- My wife's gonna...

16:24.383 --> 16:27.586
Can I have the dog if I get you
on the plane? You're airborne.

16:27.678 --> 16:31.093
- I'll get you on. Get me the dog.
- If you do, you can marry the damn dog.

16:31.181 --> 16:33.588
- You got it.
- Goddamn lunatic.

16:33.683 --> 16:36.388
Who's this guy? Who've we got here?

16:36.478 --> 16:38.719
Ow!

17:13.054 --> 17:16.257
Fine. Take the convertible. $79.95 a day.

17:16.348 --> 17:19.598
- The sign says $19.95.
- sorry. We're all out of those.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.762
- You got 20 of 'em out there!
- Reserved.

17:21.854 --> 17:24.180
- For who?
- Not you.

17:24.272 --> 17:27.358
- All right. Gimme the next cheapest one.

17:27.443 --> 17:30.397

17:30.488 --> 17:35.196
That's all right. Put them on the bill.
I don't care. And I want some insurance.

17:35.284 --> 17:37.740
- Insurance?
- Oh, yeah, I want the whole ball.

17:37.828 --> 17:42.620
I want collision, liability, medicaI, flood,
fire, theft. You got earthquake insurance?

17:42.708 --> 17:45.911

17:50.424 --> 17:53.757

Yes, sir!

17:58.932 --> 18:01.683
- Hey, this is a beautifuI car.
- Yes, sir. Top of the line.

18:01.768 --> 18:03.760
I'm a top-of-the-line kinda guy!

18:03.853 --> 18:07.020
I'll put you on our preferred-customer list.
Yes, definitely!

18:07.106 --> 18:10.024
- Great!
- I think you're a Golden Key man.

18:10.109 --> 18:11.936
- Love it.
- Absolutely.

18:12.028 --> 18:14.815
so you can rent one
of these suckers anywhere by phone!

18:14.905 --> 18:17.396
And they come with
discount tickets to seaWorld!

18:17.491 --> 18:21.655
- Thanks.
- A pleasure doing business! Need a map?

18:31.129 --> 18:33.501
Hit the floor! Now!

18:38.636 --> 18:41.092
What do you think this is?
Look what you did!

18:46.936 --> 18:49.012
Narcotics? Party of 12.

18:54.318 --> 18:57.272
sure you wanna do this?
Do you know what you're gettin' into?

18:57.363 --> 19:00.696
I watched you work for years.
You don't have to be a Harvard graduate.

19:00.783 --> 19:04.116
- They're just dogs.
- Right.

19:04.203 --> 19:07.488
- Where the hell is this dog? Mexico?
- They wouldn't take him.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.704
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

19:09.791 --> 19:12.543
- Come on, Brannigan.
- He's got a few personality quirks.

19:12.627 --> 19:15.000
- You should relate to that.
- Wait a minute.

19:15.088 --> 19:18.172
- He's not a retard, is he?
- This dog's seen more action

19:18.258 --> 19:20.464
than me and you put together.

19:20.552 --> 19:22.591
In fact, he's a little stressed out.

19:22.679 --> 19:26.048
- What do you mean by that?
- Just that he's peculiar from time to time.

19:26.140 --> 19:27.172
Peculiar?

19:28.351 --> 19:31.435
- How come he's back here?
- He's not reaI sociable.

19:31.896 --> 19:34.351
- Put this on.
- What's with the stuff?

19:34.440 --> 19:37.643
- It ain't a fashion statement.
- Hey, I don't need this stuff.

19:37.735 --> 19:40.060
It's procedure.
Everybody wears it. Put it on.

19:40.154 --> 19:42.111
You know, this is a waste of time.

19:42.197 --> 19:46.065
Just let the dog sniff me, I'll give him
some yummies, and we're outta here.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.196
Put it on. Tell me,
do you know anything about animals?

19:49.288 --> 19:51.825
- What's there to know?
- Did you have a pet?

19:51.915 --> 19:53.824
- Yeah, plenty of pets.
- What kind?

19:53.917 --> 19:55.292
- Plenty.
- Like what?

19:55.377 --> 19:57.334
- You know. Pets.
- Like what?

19:57.420 --> 20:00.374
- Fish. I had fish.
- Aw, come on. Fish? Come on. Let's go.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.458
It's a pet. It's a companion.

20:03.384 --> 20:06.718
- The most loyaI animaI I ever knew.
- Hey. You ready?

20:06.804 --> 20:09.758
- siamese fighting fish.
- All right. Let's go.

20:10.892 --> 20:15.103
- I feeI like the Michelin Man.
- I don't know. It's kinda... you.

20:15.563 --> 20:17.555
Get over here.

20:18.983 --> 20:20.691
- "Jerry Lee"?
- The killer.

20:20.776 --> 20:24.227
Wait a minute. What is this?
You think I'm gonna fence the dog?

20:24.321 --> 20:28.022
Tell me, Brannigan. How come,
if everyone has to wear one of these suits,

20:28.117 --> 20:30.109
you're not wearing one?

20:31.036 --> 20:33.029
Cos I ain't goin' in there.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.961
- Where the hell is he?
- He's in there.

20:45.049 --> 20:47.587
- I'm gettin' a full-sized dog, aren't I?
- Oh, yeah.

20:47.677 --> 20:49.670
Jerry Lee, you got company.
Up and at 'em.

20:51.764 --> 20:56.426
Jerry Lee, you got a visitor. Come on.
Up and at 'em, Jerry Lee. Come on.

21:06.904 --> 21:08.943
Are you sure this dog
can track down drugs?

21:09.031 --> 21:11.356
- Yeah.
- I don't know, Brannigan.

21:11.450 --> 21:13.857
- Looks like he's on 'em.
- Just give him a command.

21:13.952 --> 21:17.202
- He'll jump to it.
- Ah, come on.

21:17.289 --> 21:18.368
sure.

21:19.374 --> 21:21.497
Hey, pup. Kill!

21:24.713 --> 21:27.713
- "Here, boy" might have worked better.
- I'm hip!

21:27.799 --> 21:30.918
- He's always cranky when he wakes up.
- I know!

21:31.636 --> 21:34.305
- What do we do now?
- Breakfast.

21:34.972 --> 21:38.590
Yeah, breakfast. Great idea.

21:38.851 --> 21:41.140
Yeah, there he is. Best nose on the force.

21:41.228 --> 21:45.641
He could stick that snout in the wind now
and lead you to a stash in Tijuana.

21:45.733 --> 21:50.026
- I gotta be upfront. I got a bad feelin'.
- Hey, tough shit. That's all I got.

21:50.112 --> 21:52.318
No, you got a lot of dogs.
I want one of those.

21:52.406 --> 21:55.075
Do things outside the rules,
you take what you can get.

21:55.158 --> 21:58.159
- Now, take reaI good care of him.
- Don't worry about your dog.

21:58.245 --> 22:01.080
- It ain't him I'm worried about.
- Is he eatin' chilli?

22:01.164 --> 22:04.367
- What kinda animaI eats chilli?
- Hey, different strokes!

22:04.584 --> 22:06.909
- Do I have to wear this suit all day?
- Yeah.

22:07.003 --> 22:11.250
- Come on. I can't drive in this thing.
- Just hang it up on your way out.

22:13.384 --> 22:15.507
Come on, Jerry Lee.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.587
Come on! Come on!

22:22.852 --> 22:25.058
- Hey, Dooley. Good luck.
- Thanks.

22:45.623 --> 22:47.746
All right, come on.

22:47.834 --> 22:51.001
Let's go. In the car. Hup! Come on.

23:01.263 --> 23:03.339
All right. Get in the back.

23:04.975 --> 23:07.182
Jump in the back seat. Now.

23:07.895 --> 23:09.887
Move.

23:12.232 --> 23:14.225
Don't test me, because I'm gonna win.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.312
All right.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.238
It's OK. Fine. OK.

23:45.139 --> 23:47.630
You better do exactly what I tell you to do.

23:47.725 --> 23:49.931
Otherwise I'm gonna kick your butt.

23:53.605 --> 23:56.559
Brannigan's doing
a number on me. I can smell it.

24:16.294 --> 24:18.452
All right. Listen up, here!

24:18.546 --> 24:21.381
san Diego PD, Narcotics division.

24:21.465 --> 24:24.170
I want everyone
to stay right where you are.

24:24.260 --> 24:27.960
Listen! Hold it right...
stop! You, stop. Right here.

24:28.055 --> 24:32.384
san Diego Police Department, Narcotics.
Lift me up. I wanna talk to these people.

24:32.476 --> 24:34.801
Come on!

24:37.856 --> 24:40.810
san Diego PD, Narcotics division.

24:41.902 --> 24:45.946
Now, there are drugs in this warehouse.
I know it, and you know it.

24:47.365 --> 24:49.358
This dog's gonna find them,

24:49.868 --> 24:54.161
unless you cheeseballs wanna save me
some time and tell me where it is.

24:56.249 --> 24:59.368
No? All right. suit yourself.

25:00.294 --> 25:02.417
Bring me down.

25:09.345 --> 25:12.345
All right. I want you all to pay attention.

25:12.681 --> 25:16.216
This is a highly trained,
vicious K-9 police dog.

25:16.310 --> 25:20.224
so don't get in his way. This dog is
programmed to viciously attack

25:20.314 --> 25:24.394
anyone who may pose a threat
or an obstacle to this detaiI.

25:25.735 --> 25:27.728
Jerry Lee, come.

25:29.197 --> 25:31.190
Jerry Lee. Come!

25:47.256 --> 25:49.249
All right. Go.

25:51.343 --> 25:53.300
search.

25:53.387 --> 25:55.712
sniff! sniff.

26:08.485 --> 26:11.106
Just find the damn dope.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.312
"Find the damn dope"?
That's the command?

26:15.408 --> 26:17.282
Just stay there!

26:58.366 --> 27:00.193
Detective Dooley!

27:02.745 --> 27:05.117
- Lyman.
- Who's the bitch?

27:05.206 --> 27:08.539
Watch your profanity around my dog.

27:10.503 --> 27:14.666
Is that the way you talk to those
high-society friends of yours, Lyman?

27:14.757 --> 27:16.749
Hey, nice ride you got there.

27:17.718 --> 27:19.841
Black is hard to keep clean.

27:21.346 --> 27:23.635
I didn't expect to see you today.

27:23.724 --> 27:25.716
But you know what? It works out great.

27:25.809 --> 27:29.972
Know why? Now I don't have to drive all
the way across town to hauI your ass in.

27:30.063 --> 27:32.139
- Hey, is that a CD player?
- Dooley.

27:32.232 --> 27:34.723
What is it about me
that gets you so passionate?

27:34.818 --> 27:36.857
Not your looks. I think it's your job.

27:36.945 --> 27:39.518
Knowing your frontier approach
to law enforcement,

27:39.614 --> 27:42.319
I don't assume
that you have a search warrant.

27:42.825 --> 27:44.818
The dog ate it.

27:45.328 --> 27:50.404
- Hang round his taiI and wait for an hour.
- Get outta here, before I call a reaI cop.

27:53.377 --> 27:55.785
Why don't you call your lawyer, Lyman?

27:59.425 --> 28:01.583
There are drugs in this warehouse.

28:03.053 --> 28:07.964
He went right for this door. That'll give me
a warrant that'll hold up in any court.

28:08.058 --> 28:12.720
Agh! Ay, me va a morder tu perro.
Quitame el pinche perro.

28:13.438 --> 28:15.893
It was just one joint, man!

28:15.982 --> 28:19.149
- Just one joint.
- One joint?

28:19.235 --> 28:22.853
Are you gonna hauI this drug lord in
or do we just execute him on the spot?

28:22.947 --> 28:25.652
- This thing isn't over.
- I'm afraid it is.

28:25.741 --> 28:29.869
I'll get a restraining order and you won't
be able to come within five miles of me.

28:29.954 --> 28:32.492
You get whatever you want.
It's not gonna stop me.

28:32.581 --> 28:34.621
Jerry Lee, come.

28:37.544 --> 28:39.870
Jerry Lee!

28:39.963 --> 28:42.419
Come on!

28:44.760 --> 28:47.132
Buenos nachos.

28:47.554 --> 28:50.638
One joint! You found one lousy joint!

28:50.724 --> 28:54.673
You're small-time, you know that? I need
a reaI dog, is what I need. Benji!

28:54.769 --> 28:58.981
I'm taking... I got one more stop,
and then I'm taking you back. One joint!

29:09.575 --> 29:11.568
Police dog

29:11.661 --> 29:14.745
You just stay put.
This is a job for a reaI cop.

29:37.602 --> 29:39.595
Yeah? What for ya?

29:40.313 --> 29:42.306
Me?

29:44.859 --> 29:47.646
Health inspector.
Looks pretty good. I like it.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.561
Yep. Looks pretty good.

29:51.782 --> 29:54.107
Well, I guess it's that time of day, huh?

29:54.201 --> 29:58.578
Feels like happy hour to me. Know what?
I'm gonna buy all the boys a drink here.

29:58.664 --> 30:01.285
- Uh-huh.
- And give me, uh...

30:01.375 --> 30:03.830
whatever you got that's,
uh, you know, diet.

30:03.919 --> 30:06.671
- shooters?
- shooters for the boys?

30:07.673 --> 30:09.914
Give 'em some shooters!

30:10.008 --> 30:12.962
Afternoon shooters, boy, I like those.

30:13.053 --> 30:17.300
Ah, you got that, uh, pickled pigs' feet.
That looks pretty good.

30:19.893 --> 30:22.728
so how you guys doin' today?
Have a good day?

30:23.146 --> 30:24.854
Lookin' good.

30:28.276 --> 30:31.645
Thank you. Hey! Cheers, huh?

30:35.449 --> 30:41.867
Mm! I'll tell ya, on a hot day,
there's nothing like a... warm diet pop.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.366
Give 'em another round here!

30:46.877 --> 30:48.916
Ah!

30:49.338 --> 30:51.745
You know, maybe you guys
can help me out here.

30:53.675 --> 30:57.044
I'm lookin' for a buddy I used to play
chequers with. We were tight.

30:57.137 --> 31:00.671
We used to come in here, a long time ago,
before you guys were here.

31:00.765 --> 31:03.552
I miss that crazy
son of a bitch, you know?

31:03.643 --> 31:06.893
I was thinkin' about him the other day.
Oh, what was his name?

31:06.979 --> 31:10.016
He had a funny nickname,
kinda like, uh...

31:10.107 --> 31:12.598
Like Kermit the Frog, but not. You know?

31:12.693 --> 31:16.228
It was like... Benny... Benny the Mule.

31:16.322 --> 31:19.276
- Why do you wanna know about him?
- Cos he's a cop.

31:20.784 --> 31:24.153
I usually don't get a second shot
at somebody like you.

31:25.122 --> 31:26.497
Agh!

31:26.582 --> 31:30.164
You know, you made a big mistake.
This ain't a good place to be a cop.

31:30.252 --> 31:33.206
If I caught you at a bad time,
I can always come back later.

31:34.548 --> 31:37.039
Yeah, you know, Dooley,
I could shoot you.

31:37.133 --> 31:40.917
That'd be too easy on you
and it wouldn't be any fun for me.

31:41.012 --> 31:43.764
No, I think I'll just
beat the shit outta you!

31:46.893 --> 31:49.051
What the hell is that?

31:49.145 --> 31:51.351
That's... Officer Lewis.

31:52.356 --> 31:54.930
san Diego K-9. You're all under arrest.

31:55.985 --> 31:59.567
so line up against the wall,
hands above your head, and spread 'em.

31:59.655 --> 32:01.861
Hey, we give up.

32:02.366 --> 32:05.699
I'm not kiddin'. Hey, listen, I'm tellin' ya.

32:05.786 --> 32:08.324
One command outta me,
he'll rip your throats out.

32:08.413 --> 32:12.493
- Line up against that wall!
- I'm scared shitless. Aren't you, guys?

32:14.252 --> 32:15.711
Get outta here!

32:18.256 --> 32:20.249
You're a hard guy, huh?

33:27.740 --> 33:29.697
Could you call off your dog?

33:29.783 --> 33:33.567
- I'm sorry. What?
- Could you call off your dog?

33:35.580 --> 33:38.747
Hm. Well, I don't know, Benny.
That depends on you.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.669
Listen, that hit was nothin' personaI.
It was just a job.

33:41.753 --> 33:45.703
- Who contracted the hit, Benny?
- I don't know. I nev... I never saw the guy.

33:45.799 --> 33:48.468
No? Come on,
don't get cute with me, Benny.

33:48.551 --> 33:51.422
- This dog hasn't eaten since yesterday.
- It's the truth.

33:51.512 --> 33:53.754
I don't know any names.
He never gave me any.

33:53.848 --> 33:57.976
Did he mention anything about, like,
a shipment of drugs comin' in?

33:58.060 --> 34:01.180
- He say anything about that?
- I don't know nothin'.

34:02.523 --> 34:05.310
- Bite his dick off.
- No! No! Wait! No! Whoa!

34:05.401 --> 34:08.070
I know, OK? There is a shipment. I forgot.

34:09.237 --> 34:13.531
But it ain't goin' near the streets. It's all
goin' to one buyer. I don't know who it is.

34:13.617 --> 34:15.906
- Lunchtime!
- No, I know! All right, I know!

34:15.994 --> 34:18.746
I know who it is. I know who it is.

34:18.830 --> 34:20.704
It's... it's a dude named Gilliam.

34:20.790 --> 34:23.661
Big-timer. He's comin' in tomorrow.
HoteI deI Coronado.

34:23.752 --> 34:26.706
He's lookin' to score large. That's it.

34:26.795 --> 34:29.880
- You sure?
- I boost a couple of cars now and then.

34:29.966 --> 34:33.382
And before I became a shooter,
I was in a couple of gay biker snuff films.

34:33.469 --> 34:37.052
- What do you want from me?!
- You should be disgusted with yourself.

34:37.139 --> 34:39.132
OK, Jerry. Come!

34:44.522 --> 34:46.679
Arrest this guy for attempted murder,

34:46.774 --> 34:49.728
and the rest of them
for cruelty to animals.

35:03.957 --> 35:05.949
You did all right. It was OK.

35:07.168 --> 35:09.161
That wasn't too bad.

35:09.921 --> 35:12.875
But I want you to know that
I am the officer in charge here.

35:12.966 --> 35:15.338
MichaeI Dooley, not Jerry Lee.

35:15.426 --> 35:19.554
Don't you ever,
ever pull anything like that again

35:19.639 --> 35:22.260
without talkin' to me first!

35:22.350 --> 35:24.923
You lost it in there. You lost controI!

35:25.019 --> 35:28.222
We coulda gotten killed!
I needed you back here.

35:28.314 --> 35:31.065
What if they ran out?
You coulda got 'em here.

35:32.151 --> 35:34.143
You understand?

35:43.036 --> 35:45.029
Get in the back seat!

35:55.965 --> 35:59.416
You stink.
This car stinks, do you know that?

36:01.262 --> 36:06.089
If we're gonna spend time together,
I've gotta deodorise your mangy little ass.

36:06.183 --> 36:08.555
Tracy's gonna kick you and me both out.

36:09.561 --> 36:12.432
she's kind of a neat person.
You'II like her.

36:15.567 --> 36:19.980
OK. It's time you joined
the civilised world, buddy.

36:20.072 --> 36:23.820
Now, what we have here is dry shampoo.
We can do it right here on the spot.

36:23.909 --> 36:25.985
We got some doggy deodorant here.

36:26.077 --> 36:32.993
"Your dog will smell like cedar chips
all day long, just like the champions. "

36:33.084 --> 36:36.120
Come on, get out of the car. We'll do it.

36:36.212 --> 36:39.129
Come on. I'm doin' you a favour.
You smell like shit.

36:39.215 --> 36:41.920
You lack personaI hygiene.
You understand that?

36:42.009 --> 36:45.425
Here. Come on,
this is uptown stuff. smell this.

36:46.347 --> 36:48.386
Now, listen.

36:51.518 --> 36:53.890
Hey! Gimme that!

36:56.607 --> 37:01.648
All right. If that's the way you want it,
that's the way you're gonna have it.

37:04.114 --> 37:06.521
¤ You might not ever get rich

37:08.284 --> 37:11.653
¤ But let me tell ya,
it's better than diggin' a ditch

37:12.539 --> 37:15.658
¤ There ain't no tellin' who you might meet

37:16.125 --> 37:19.660
¤ A movie star,
or maybe even an Indian chief

37:19.754 --> 37:21.960
¤ Workin' at the car wash

37:23.966 --> 37:27.169
¤ Workin' at the car wash, yeah

37:27.261 --> 37:30.048
- ¤ Come on and sing it with me
- ¤ Car wash

37:31.223 --> 37:35.351
- ¤ Sing it with the feelin', y'all
- ¤ Car wash, yeah

37:37.521 --> 37:40.190
¤ Some of the work gets kinda hard

37:41.775 --> 37:45.191
¤ This ain't no place to be
if you planned on bein' a star...

37:47.197 --> 37:49.189
You look good.

37:53.411 --> 37:57.195
Dry him off reaI good, boys.
Buff up that beak! Yeah.

37:57.498 --> 37:59.621
Hey, extra dollar for a hot wax, right?

38:00.001 --> 38:02.622
Armor-All him for me!

38:04.130 --> 38:06.621
You smell good, but not like cedar chips.

38:08.300 --> 38:12.713
Well, that concludes today's lesson
on "Don't screw with MichaeI Dooley. "

38:12.805 --> 38:15.640
Class is dismissed.

38:38.997 --> 38:41.072
That's all right. That was worth it.

38:58.432 --> 39:04.268
so, you wanna tell me why I was talking
to a dead man this afternoon?

39:05.063 --> 39:07.636
We had no way of knowing
that guy wasn't in the car.

39:07.732 --> 39:10.188
Yeah. That's because
you were in a helicopter.

39:10.277 --> 39:12.767
What kind of bullshit is that?

39:12.862 --> 39:18.023
Choppers, machine guns.
Who do you guys think you are? Marines?

39:21.079 --> 39:23.237
And you.

39:23.331 --> 39:25.904
Why didn't you come to me?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.242
Haven't I always taken care of you?

39:29.045 --> 39:32.045
And you pay me back
by sending the law to my warehouse.

39:32.131 --> 39:34.123
I didn't tell him nothin'!

39:35.092 --> 39:37.844
I don't know how he found out about that.

39:37.928 --> 39:41.095
Come on. I'd never roll on you guys.

39:42.349 --> 39:44.555
I'm worried.

39:44.643 --> 39:46.635
This guy Dooley's crazy.

39:49.022 --> 39:51.311
Yeah. Crazy.

39:52.984 --> 39:57.029
Well, I'll tell you something, Freddie.

39:57.113 --> 40:01.442
You wouldn't be in this position
if these pissants had done their job.

40:03.035 --> 40:05.111
You wanna know how to kill a man?

40:05.955 --> 40:08.362
Well, I'll tell you how to kill a man.

40:08.457 --> 40:12.158
You forget this hi-tech stuff.
You get a gun.

40:13.587 --> 40:15.580
And then you find the man,

40:16.882 --> 40:18.875
and you grab him.

40:19.551 --> 40:22.552
And you put the gun to his head,

40:22.638 --> 40:26.303
and you send his brains into outer space.

40:32.272 --> 40:34.264
Not bad, huh?

40:34.357 --> 40:36.765
Yeah. It's my nephew's.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.728
It's a toy.

40:45.868 --> 40:47.660
This one's reaI.

40:53.334 --> 40:58.541
Now, this Dooley's
already into me for one shipment.

41:00.549 --> 41:03.254
I don't want him to get
the next one. You understand?

41:03.343 --> 41:05.550
- He's dead.
- "He's dead, he's dead. "

41:05.637 --> 41:08.093
Don't tell me he's dead!

41:08.181 --> 41:10.174
I want it done right this time.

41:12.561 --> 41:14.933
I want it finished with this...

41:15.730 --> 41:17.723
cop.

41:20.068 --> 41:22.060
Clean this up.

41:42.131 --> 41:44.123
Trace?

41:45.425 --> 41:47.465
Honey?

41:47.552 --> 41:49.545
Tracy?

41:50.555 --> 41:52.631
I'm late. I'm late. I know I'm late.

41:52.724 --> 41:56.057
I know I'm late. We missed
the ballet tonight, didn't we? Damn!

41:56.144 --> 41:59.394
And you know how
I love the ballet. Love it!

41:59.481 --> 42:01.888
I... Oh, you got the flowers.

42:01.983 --> 42:04.272
I... I didn't know that.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.029
Yeah, you owe me $45. They came COD.

42:09.490 --> 42:12.277
Did you know you have an animaI
growing out of your pants?

42:12.368 --> 42:15.488
Thank you, honey. I also have a dog here.

42:16.831 --> 42:20.246
- Why is it among us?
- Oh, that's the reason I'm late.

42:20.334 --> 42:23.750
I was racing home, trying
to get here to pick you up for the ballet,

42:23.837 --> 42:26.126
and I passed this window,
and there he was.

42:26.215 --> 42:29.749
Just sitting there,
looking a little lonely, a little helpIess.

42:29.843 --> 42:32.334
I had to pick him up, honey. You like him?

42:33.013 --> 42:35.420
- He's very sweet.
- He is, isn't he?

42:35.890 --> 42:37.800
- Does he have a name?
- Uh-uh.

42:39.394 --> 42:41.517
I think we should think of one together.

42:41.604 --> 42:43.893
- How about...
- Jerry! Jerry's a good name.

42:43.982 --> 42:47.066
- Yeah. Jerry. That's great.
- Does he do any tricks?

42:47.151 --> 42:50.069
No, I haven't had
too much time to work with him.

42:50.988 --> 42:52.945
Can you speak?

42:53.032 --> 42:55.024
Good boy! Can you kiss?

42:55.117 --> 42:57.074
Ooh!

42:57.161 --> 42:59.486
Oh, you're a good puppy dog, huh?

42:59.580 --> 43:02.450
- You're a sweetheart!
- Ass-kisser.

43:02.541 --> 43:04.534
Oh, sure, I taught him those tricks.

43:04.626 --> 43:08.244
Those are nothin', the easy ones.
I've been workin' on tougher things.

43:08.338 --> 43:10.331
You know, like card tricks.

43:10.424 --> 43:14.587
Tracy, I'm really sorry about the ballet.
I promise I'll take you later in the season,

43:14.678 --> 43:16.836
like, during the play-offs.

43:25.355 --> 43:28.024
- He's very protective.
- Mm-hm.

43:30.234 --> 43:31.610
Agh!

43:31.694 --> 43:33.983
Come here! Come on in the kitchen!

43:35.239 --> 43:37.232
Come on in the kitchen!

43:37.825 --> 43:39.901
Come on in the kitchen.

43:39.994 --> 43:43.612
- Come on, Jerry. Come on.
- OK. Go with Dooley.

43:43.706 --> 43:46.410
Yeah! Yeah!

43:46.500 --> 43:48.706
Let's get somethin' to eat! Yeah!

43:48.794 --> 43:51.201
Ooh, yeah!

43:51.546 --> 43:54.749
Look. Let's get one thing straight:
the woman is mine!

43:54.841 --> 43:58.292
We're both members of the animaI
kingdom. You know that, I know that.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.423
And we both know
that this thing is really primaI.

44:01.514 --> 44:04.088
If you think you're such a badass,
try that once more

44:04.184 --> 44:07.054
and you're gonna end up
in a pet cemetery.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.433
You remember the movie
Old Yeller?. Do you?

44:09.522 --> 44:11.680
Remember when
they shot him at the end?

44:11.774 --> 44:15.225
I didn't cry! Now come on!

44:15.903 --> 44:18.228
Honey, I think he needs to go outside.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.031
Nice night. Enjoy the view.

44:34.046 --> 44:37.580
- Do you think he's in pain?
- Not yet.

44:37.674 --> 44:40.426
Honey, why... why would he be in pain?

44:40.510 --> 44:44.093
shut that damn dog up!
some of us are tryin' to sleep!

44:45.765 --> 44:48.338
I'll handle it.

44:57.443 --> 45:00.016
Come on, Jerry. You hungry?

45:00.112 --> 45:02.105
A little late-night snack?

45:02.740 --> 45:06.025
You know, we're a couple
of smart guys, you know that?

45:06.785 --> 45:10.486
I like that in a dog. She likes that in a dog.

45:10.581 --> 45:12.739
And she likes you.

45:12.833 --> 45:14.825
But she loves me!

45:15.752 --> 45:18.706
I just need a couple of hours.
You understand?

45:18.797 --> 45:21.122
Here. You hungry?

45:21.216 --> 45:23.208
T- bone. 16-ounce.

45:23.301 --> 45:25.709
Mm. Good.

45:25.803 --> 45:28.045
It'll thaw out in a few hours. Have a ball.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.473
I'm back. All right.

45:39.191 --> 45:40.899
Mm.

45:42.611 --> 45:44.651
- Give me that.
- Dooley!

45:45.281 --> 45:48.365
- Mm.
- He sucked that thing frozen!

45:48.450 --> 45:50.858
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

45:59.252 --> 46:01.708
You're trying to piss me off, aren't you?

46:01.796 --> 46:04.466
You're pissing me off!

46:04.883 --> 46:07.290
Come on! Come on!

46:08.386 --> 46:10.959
Come on! Behind you!

46:16.894 --> 46:18.887
Come on! Come here. Ow! Ow!

46:19.355 --> 46:21.810
- My eye! My eye!
- Dooley!

46:22.817 --> 46:25.189
- Hi, honey.
- What's going on?

46:25.277 --> 46:28.942
I think he was just a little bit lonely.
He wanted to play.

46:29.573 --> 46:31.898
- We should bring him into the bedroom.
- No!

46:31.992 --> 46:34.150
- I don't think so.
- Come on. What a good boy!

46:34.244 --> 46:37.494
- Oh, he loves it out here! He really does!
- Come on.

46:39.082 --> 46:43.744
You're a sweetheart.
Just a little sweetheart.

46:47.382 --> 46:49.670
Come on, Dooley.

46:57.725 --> 47:00.097
Oh!

47:04.773 --> 47:06.766
Mm. Ouch. Ooh.

47:07.943 --> 47:10.944
Ow, you bit me. Ow.

47:11.321 --> 47:14.026
- stop that. You can't bite me.
- You love it.

47:20.622 --> 47:23.576
I can't. I can't do it.

47:24.542 --> 47:27.709
- Why?
- He's watchin' me. I can feeI his eyes.

47:29.923 --> 47:32.876
Look at him.
He's sitting there evaluating me.

47:33.760 --> 47:36.001
He's not the one you have to impress.

48:12.380 --> 48:13.210
Jesus!

48:14.173 --> 48:17.838
- Want some eggs?
- No, I'll catch a doughnut downtown.

48:17.927 --> 48:19.920
I gotta get goin'. Bye.

48:20.012 --> 48:23.346
- Thank you for a hell of a night.
- My pleasure. I mean that!

48:23.432 --> 48:27.264
Oh... I mean it too. Good morning!

48:27.353 --> 48:31.053
What's the matter? Can't take it? Huh?

48:31.148 --> 48:34.813
Kinda grinds you down in the battle
of wits, you're fighting unarmed?

48:34.902 --> 48:37.143
Well, you're just a bad loser, that's all.

48:37.237 --> 48:41.899
You gotta learn one thing: winning
isn't everything, but losing is nothing.

48:43.577 --> 48:46.447
- Dooley...
- Huh? Yeah?

48:49.833 --> 48:51.825
Yes, ma'am.

48:55.463 --> 48:57.752
- Aw, shit.
- Exactly.

49:01.594 --> 49:04.299
I can't believe
all that came out of one animaI.

49:38.337 --> 49:40.793
Hey, notice anything different?

49:41.883 --> 49:44.718
Huh? sure you do.

49:44.802 --> 49:49.547
I used to say "Get in the car", "Get outta
the car", "Get in the back seat", "stay".

49:49.640 --> 49:51.633
Commands are out. This is in.

49:52.434 --> 49:56.479
There you go. You don't wanna listen,
I don't wanna talk.

49:57.231 --> 49:59.223
All right? see you later, bub.

50:07.282 --> 50:09.903
- Your champagne, sir.
- What is this?

50:09.993 --> 50:13.196
- I didn't order any champagne.
- I know that, sir. It's a gift.

50:13.288 --> 50:15.446
Take it back.
It must belong to somebody else.

50:15.540 --> 50:18.113
- They said Mr Gilliam.
- I said get it out of here.

50:18.209 --> 50:20.202
I don't want the champagne.

50:26.717 --> 50:28.710
Lunch today?

50:28.803 --> 50:31.128
- Is it expensive?
- Yes.

50:31.222 --> 50:34.425
- How about a tall iced tea?
- There's a minimum.

50:34.516 --> 50:36.473
- Why don't you just bring me the...
- OK.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.553
.. menu?

50:41.732 --> 50:43.689
Good boy!

50:43.775 --> 50:46.017
What a good dog you are.

50:46.111 --> 50:48.103
sit!

50:48.822 --> 50:50.482
speak!

50:50.573 --> 50:52.198
sit up.

50:54.077 --> 50:56.532
Go put your ball away.

51:00.958 --> 51:02.951
Gimme some lovin'!

51:03.503 --> 51:06.290
That's... that's... that's great.

51:06.380 --> 51:08.669
That's really... How do you do that?

51:08.758 --> 51:12.376
Well, first of all, you've got
to give the dog a lot of love.

51:13.262 --> 51:15.385
- A good, healthy diet.
- Chilli.

51:15.472 --> 51:18.509
Exercise is important, too.
You know, the key

51:18.600 --> 51:21.174
is to establish alpha leader
as soon as possible.

51:21.270 --> 51:24.389
- Alpha leader? What's that?
- You gotta show 'em who's boss.

51:24.481 --> 51:28.099
- Imprint on their psyche.
- I've done that. Believe me, I've done that.

51:28.193 --> 51:32.570
- What... what... what is it, exactly.
- Most effective is to stare them down.

51:32.655 --> 51:35.609
You look straight at them.
You make them look away first.

51:35.700 --> 51:37.693
- I can do that.
- Even if it takes hours.

51:37.785 --> 51:39.908
I can do that. I can do that.

51:39.996 --> 51:42.665
- That's it, right?
- After that, you mount them.

51:42.748 --> 51:45.074
- Excuse me?
- You mount them.

51:45.501 --> 51:47.624
- You mount them?
- Uh-huh.

51:47.712 --> 51:49.834
- You mean...?
- Yeah.

51:49.922 --> 51:51.915
Mount them?

51:53.342 --> 51:55.500
Mount them. Lucky dog.

51:59.556 --> 52:01.549
Mount them?

52:07.147 --> 52:09.305
Jesus!

52:09.399 --> 52:12.151
- What are you doin' here?
- sir? Excuse me.

52:12.235 --> 52:14.477
- No dogs in the hoteI.
- What about her?

52:14.571 --> 52:18.070
- What about her?
- she has a dog. What do you call that?

52:18.157 --> 52:20.992
The hoteI owner's daughter.
And the dog has to go.

52:21.369 --> 52:24.156
- Well, this is my seeing Eye dog.
- You're blind?

52:24.247 --> 52:27.247
- Yes.
- Were you blind when you walked in?

52:27.333 --> 52:29.325
Yes, definitely.

52:30.044 --> 52:33.792
I'm so sorry. Would you like me
to read you the menu?

52:33.881 --> 52:35.873
No, I can handle it.

52:38.093 --> 52:40.086
Thank you.

52:45.267 --> 52:47.390
Is that my tea?

52:47.477 --> 52:51.261
You just ripped the mirror off
of my classic 1965 Mustang.

52:54.567 --> 52:57.272
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.

53:06.621 --> 53:08.862
If you don't get down -
I don't care where we are -

53:08.956 --> 53:12.455
I'm gonna pull my revolver out
and shoot you.

53:14.211 --> 53:16.998
I am the alpha leader.

53:18.132 --> 53:20.124
I don't wanna have to mount you.

53:21.927 --> 53:24.003
That'll do it.

53:30.560 --> 53:33.265
Jerry Lee! Excuse me. I'm blind.

53:33.355 --> 53:35.928
I'm blind. I'm blind. I'm blind.

53:36.024 --> 53:39.891
Excuse me. I'm blind! I'm blind.

54:08.805 --> 54:10.264
shit!

54:11.141 --> 54:14.344
I don't know why you California people
insist on meeting outside.

54:14.436 --> 54:16.808
If I wanted a tan,
I woulda gone to the Bahamas.

54:16.896 --> 54:19.434
I like California. It's been good to me.

54:19.524 --> 54:22.727
- Tonight is the night.
- sounds good, but so did the last time.

54:22.819 --> 54:27.066
- Ten million bucks' worth of coke, gone.
- Never again. Nobody'll get this.

54:27.156 --> 54:30.027
- If there's exposure...
- I don't like a nervous partner,

54:30.117 --> 54:33.782
so calm down or I'm gonna blow this
whole deaI and sell to somebody else.

54:33.871 --> 54:35.864
Oh...!

54:36.499 --> 54:40.081
Don't threaten me, Mr Lyman.
I'm in the threat business.

54:43.172 --> 54:46.338
Please don't take this the wrong way.

54:48.719 --> 54:52.799
- We need to get details straight.
- Just make sure you hold up your end.

54:52.889 --> 54:56.305
- You just make sure everything's on time.
- I'm not gonna wait for ever.

54:56.393 --> 55:00.260
I'm really sorry. You don't know what's
goin' on here, but you just saved my life.

55:00.355 --> 55:02.347
Agh!

55:03.524 --> 55:05.517
I appreciate that.

55:06.361 --> 55:09.397
Ughhh. Very kind of you. Thank you.

55:27.297 --> 55:29.290
Come here!

55:40.018 --> 55:42.010
What do you want? Get back.

55:43.146 --> 55:45.138
Get back! Get away from me.

55:46.691 --> 55:49.442
What are you talkin' about?
Get away from me.

55:50.111 --> 55:53.112
What? There's nothin' in here for you.

55:53.197 --> 55:55.190
This is police stuff here.

55:56.659 --> 55:58.651
Go away. Get away from me.

56:00.579 --> 56:02.572
This is mine!

56:04.500 --> 56:06.576
Let me eat in peace, will you?

56:06.668 --> 56:09.040
What? What? You can't have this!

56:09.671 --> 56:12.293
All right. I'll split it.
I'll split it with you, OK?

56:12.382 --> 56:15.502
What? I said I'd split it with you!
Here! Here! Here! Here!

56:15.594 --> 56:17.882
Take the whole goddamn thing!

56:18.888 --> 56:21.675
Jesus! There's all kinds of sugar in that.

56:23.101 --> 56:24.429
Down!

56:45.330 --> 56:47.157
Jesus!

57:05.850 --> 57:09.017
You look like
you've been in a skiing accident!

57:21.490 --> 57:23.981
You wanna drive, get a licence!

57:43.053 --> 57:44.428
Yeah!

58:24.217 --> 58:26.210
What?

58:27.262 --> 58:29.254
What?

58:30.181 --> 58:32.304
Wait! I've only got two legs!

58:54.955 --> 58:57.243
Agh!

59:07.550 --> 59:10.255
All right. I'm comin'. I'm comin'!

59:12.055 --> 59:13.715
Don't let that dog psych you out.

59:13.806 --> 59:16.214
I'm comin'! shut your yap!

59:16.309 --> 59:19.642
I'm comin'. I just want a running start
before I hit the pavement.

59:34.576 --> 59:36.367
Aaarghhh!

59:46.963 --> 59:50.498
Christ! Jesus! I woulda cleared it
if you hadn't barked.

59:50.592 --> 59:53.129
You threw me off!

59:53.219 --> 59:57.430
I suppose you think you're
such a hotshot... because you made it.

01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:18.025
You sure about this, huh?

01:00:40.848 --> 01:00:44.299
Oh, yeah, he's up here!

01:00:44.393 --> 01:00:47.844
Yes, sir! Got a smart puppy there!

01:00:47.938 --> 01:00:50.476
What?!

01:00:50.566 --> 01:00:53.401
Whaddaya want? There's no one up here!

01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:55.771
There's nobody here. What?

01:00:55.863 --> 01:00:58.650
I jumped over that damn thing
and no one's up here.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.868
Hey! Get back here when
I'm yellin' at you! I want you to listen.

01:01:02.953 --> 01:01:06.203
What are you barkin' at?
Oh no, I got it. You're not barkin'.

01:01:06.498 --> 01:01:09.617
No, no. I can tell the difference
between a bark and a laugh!

01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:12.959
This is a dog joke. Ha, ha, ha, ha

01:01:13.046 --> 01:01:17.090
Oh, I'm laughin'. How many guys
have you brought up here, huh?

01:01:17.592 --> 01:01:19.880
No, you pulled a good one.

01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:24.430
I can see you down tonight, talking
to your chums, down at the pound.

01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:28.014
Yeah, havin' a good one.
"I pulled one on old Dooley. "

01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:29.513
You never give up, do you?

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:46.026
Arghhh!

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:03.009
Now there's a guy who definitely
has a right to remain silent.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.592
What?

01:02:07.681 --> 01:02:10.433
What do you want now? Want a medaI?

01:02:10.517 --> 01:02:12.510
Huh?

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.601
All right, all right. You found him.

01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:19.066
Good job.

01:02:36.584 --> 01:02:38.624
Here you go. Halstead Motors.

01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:40.704
Got it.

01:03:15.079 --> 01:03:17.535
- Hi.
- Welcome to Halstead Motors. You are...?

01:03:17.749 --> 01:03:19.706
- Detective Dooley.
- And he is...?

01:03:19.792 --> 01:03:21.666
- With me.
- How can I help you?

01:03:21.752 --> 01:03:23.792
I got this invoice on one of your autos.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.833
Can you tell me if it's in dealer's stock
or if it's been sold?

01:03:26.966 --> 01:03:29.457
I'll have Miss Hewitt
check it out right away.

01:03:29.552 --> 01:03:31.544
Thank you.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.928
You like this car?

01:03:43.023 --> 01:03:47.151
That's only 100,000 bucks.
That's 700,000 in doggie dollars.

01:03:54.409 --> 01:03:57.030
What are you doin'?

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.326
Huh? Whaddaya got?

01:04:00.039 --> 01:04:03.040
Find something? Whaddaya got?
You got something in there?

01:04:03.126 --> 01:04:06.874
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
That's a $70,000 car there, sport.

01:04:06.963 --> 01:04:10.166
Ah. sorry about that, but the dog
has his own mind. You know?

01:04:10.257 --> 01:04:13.211
No problem. Name's Don. sales manager.

01:04:13.552 --> 01:04:17.087
- MichaeI Dooley. Nice to meet ya.
- BeautifuI dog. How can I help you?

01:04:17.181 --> 01:04:21.889
- Well, I'm interested in this car.
- Mercedes 560 sL. Nothing more to say.

01:04:22.144 --> 01:04:24.302
- Nothing?
- Nothing. Car sells itself.

01:04:24.396 --> 01:04:28.559
It says you've arrived, Mike. It speaks
of stability, class, family values.

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:31.319
- But I'm single, Don.
- It's a babemobile, Mike.

01:04:31.403 --> 01:04:35.780
- I gotta have it. Let's test-drive it.
- Can do, Mike. I'll get the keys.

01:04:35.865 --> 01:04:40.657
All right, buddy. Let's get this thing
outta here, then you can have it.

01:04:40.745 --> 01:04:43.034
- Detective Dooley?
- Yes.

01:04:43.122 --> 01:04:45.909
- I'm Jack Halstead, the owner.
- Oh, Jack, yeah.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.538
I was gonna take this baby
out for a test-drive.

01:04:48.628 --> 01:04:52.625
- Do you have 70,000 dollars?
- No, but I can do better than that.

01:04:52.715 --> 01:04:54.921
I have a brand-new Mercedes,
low mileage.

01:04:55.009 --> 01:04:57.879
It was used once,
in an attempted murder.

01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:00.425
Oh yes. This one.

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:05.309
This car was reported stolen off the lot
at four o'clock this morning.

01:05:05.394 --> 01:05:07.552
Aw, Jack, does that mean
we don't have a deaI?

01:05:07.646 --> 01:05:09.769
Call your station and confirm it,

01:05:09.856 --> 01:05:13.190
but not from my phone
and not from my lot.

01:05:18.239 --> 01:05:22.568
All right. I know, I know. I know the car's
dirty. I just don't wanna do it now.

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.151
I wanna be there at the exchange.

01:05:25.246 --> 01:05:29.457
I want Lyman. Let's go. Come on.

01:05:35.297 --> 01:05:37.290
All right, buddy.

01:05:38.217 --> 01:05:40.209
I'll be just a minute.

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:52.678
- Hi. Can I help you?
- What have we got here?

01:06:02.532 --> 01:06:04.690
¤ Oh, yeah

01:06:06.244 --> 01:06:08.865
¤ Oh, yeah

01:06:09.705 --> 01:06:12.327
¤ Oh, yeah

01:06:14.084 --> 01:06:16.077
¤ The moon

01:06:17.963 --> 01:06:19.790
¤ Beautiful

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:23.543
¤ The sun

01:06:24.803 --> 01:06:27.175
¤ Even more beautiful

01:06:28.807 --> 01:06:31.298
¤ Oh, yeah

01:06:32.394 --> 01:06:34.885
¤ Oh, yeah

01:06:35.522 --> 01:06:38.641
¤ Oh, yeah

01:06:38.817 --> 01:06:41.817
Hey, buddy. she's hot, huh?

01:06:42.445 --> 01:06:45.362
Yes, sir. Looks and money.

01:06:45.448 --> 01:06:48.947
Love it when they shave
their beaks. Don't you?

01:06:49.035 --> 01:06:52.569
You know what? This kind loves cops.

01:06:52.663 --> 01:06:54.786
Loves 'em.

01:06:54.874 --> 01:06:57.828
Boy, can you imagine
what she'd do to you?

01:06:57.918 --> 01:07:01.252
Well, that's too bad. You're on duty now.

01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:03.663
It's definitely an all-nighter.

01:07:07.052 --> 01:07:09.341
You got ten minutes.

01:07:41.502 --> 01:07:43.993
- What are you doing?
- Don't lean against my ride.

01:07:44.088 --> 01:07:45.546
This is your car? I'm sorry.

01:07:45.631 --> 01:07:47.837
Don't stand next to it.
stand next to yours.

01:07:47.925 --> 01:07:51.293
That's nice, but this is beautifuI.
Where'd you get those glasses?

01:07:51.386 --> 01:07:53.379
Did you get those glasses in the mall?

01:07:53.472 --> 01:07:57.339
I'd like to get a pair of those.
I need some sunglasses. Is this your car?

01:07:57.434 --> 01:08:00.185
- something's goin' on in there.
- In here?

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:02.725
some big dog is humpin' my Aretha!

01:08:02.814 --> 01:08:04.806
No!

01:08:05.566 --> 01:08:08.603
- Is that your dog?
- Technically? No.

01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:11.854
Let's work something out.
They're almost done.

01:08:11.948 --> 01:08:14.865
- Why don't I buy you a tank of gas?
- A tank of gas?

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:17.524
For my Aretha? Get reaI!
That's a $100 dog!

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.992
How about 25 bucks
and a full tank of gas?

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.615
I gotta get at least a bill for Lady Ree.
I'm a businessman. You dig?

01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:27.788
- I'm a cop. You dig?
- A cop? You're a cop?

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.453
- You're kiddin' me.
- Yeah.

01:08:30.549 --> 01:08:34.416
- No problem.
- Hey! Uh, here. This is for the little lady.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:36.502
Thank you, officer.

01:08:41.518 --> 01:08:43.510
Jerry Lee. Time's up.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:46.761
¤ Whoa! I feel good

01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:50.433
¤ I knew that I would now

01:08:51.944 --> 01:08:54.269
¤ I feel good

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:56.904
¤ I knew that I would now

01:08:58.908 --> 01:09:01.827
¤ So good, so good

01:09:01.912 --> 01:09:03.868
¤ I got you

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:08.453
¤ Whoa! And I feel nice

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.536
¤ Like sugar and spice

01:09:12.089 --> 01:09:14.127
¤ I feel nice

01:09:15.175 --> 01:09:17.167
¤ Like sugar and spice

01:09:19.136 --> 01:09:21.889
¤ So nice, so nice

01:09:21.973 --> 01:09:23.966
¤ That I got you

01:09:29.522 --> 01:09:31.515
¤ Hey!

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:43.193
Jerry Lee. Let's go.

01:10:03.638 --> 01:10:05.631
Tracy?

01:10:08.101 --> 01:10:10.093
Trace?

01:10:15.858 --> 01:10:18.100
Honey. Honey?

01:10:31.957 --> 01:10:35.207
What are you actin' up about?
You should be mellow. You got laid.

01:10:41.132 --> 01:10:43.588
Uh, oops.
I think I have the wrong number.

01:10:43.676 --> 01:10:46.512
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah, Tracy, it's Jack.

01:10:46.596 --> 01:10:49.051
We've changed the date of the seminar
to the 5th,

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.723
so you have more time to prepare
your material. OK? See ya.

01:10:55.229 --> 01:10:59.690
I'm calling for
Michael Dooley. This is the third call.

01:10:59.775 --> 01:11:02.942
This is Stan Gamboa
from Internal Revenue...

01:11:03.028 --> 01:11:05.863
- Yeah, right, stan.
- .. set up a time for your audit. Call me.

01:11:05.948 --> 01:11:08.699
Yeah, I'll call ya. sure. Fat chance.

01:11:11.578 --> 01:11:15.658
Dooley, listen carefully.
I'm with some people right now.

01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:18.074
They came to the house.

01:11:18.168 --> 01:11:21.122
Dooley, you have to do
what they say. Please.

01:11:21.713 --> 01:11:23.456
Dooley?

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:32.221
Tracy's real smart.
She's behaving.

01:11:32.306 --> 01:11:35.307
You gotta be smart too
if you wanna see her again.

01:11:35.393 --> 01:11:40.849
That shipment you're chasin', just
let it go. Stay home tonight. Don't leave.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.059
Do your part and you'll have breakfast
with your girl tomorrow.

01:11:44.151 --> 01:11:46.227
And don't push this any more.

01:12:15.014 --> 01:12:17.256
Wash it, wax it, put a windshield in.

01:12:31.905 --> 01:12:33.399
Hi!

01:12:39.704 --> 01:12:42.539
- Hey.
- It's by invitation only.

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.663
- Call the cops.
- You don't belong here.

01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:47.076
Call the cops.

01:12:51.758 --> 01:12:54.545
sorry we're late!

01:12:56.554 --> 01:12:58.547
Ken!

01:13:00.474 --> 01:13:04.686
This is a bitchin' pad, man!
You got a pooI in your dining room!

01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:06.929
You know, I gotta get one of these.

01:13:07.106 --> 01:13:11.269
Hey, I'm sorry Tracy couldn't make it,
but she kinda disappeared on me.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:15.025
But the invitation did say bring a guest,
so I brought Jerry Lee.

01:13:15.113 --> 01:13:18.945
- Why don't you mingle with the guests?
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:13:19.034 --> 01:13:21.441
Ken, come on now. I just got here.

01:13:21.536 --> 01:13:24.371
- Please escort this man to the door.
- Freeze!

01:13:26.875 --> 01:13:29.282
Oh, I'm not gonna shoot you.

01:13:29.377 --> 01:13:32.793
You guys are good guys.
He's the bad guy.

01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:35.716
Ken, I'd have a seat.
You don't look too good.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.251
Well, I think we'd best all do as he says.

01:13:39.345 --> 01:13:41.753
No, Ken, just you. Not "we" - "you".

01:13:41.847 --> 01:13:44.385
This poor man is obviously
confused and upset.

01:13:44.475 --> 01:13:47.144
Upset? Do I look upset to you?

01:13:47.228 --> 01:13:49.849
Am I upset? Do I look upset?
I'm not upset.

01:13:49.939 --> 01:13:52.939
I'm a party animaI! I love parties, Ken!

01:13:53.025 --> 01:13:55.516
Come on! What's the grub like?

01:13:55.819 --> 01:13:57.942
Hm.

01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:00.817
This wine sucks. Is this crystaI?

01:14:02.701 --> 01:14:05.108
Doesn't have the ring.
Don't think it's crystaI.

01:14:05.412 --> 01:14:07.618
I'm pretty disappointed in this man here.

01:14:07.706 --> 01:14:10.113
For a murderer and
a kidnapper and a drug runner,

01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:13.826
I thought you'd have a little better taste.
I mean, where's the brew?

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.170
Where's the sounds?
And the lighting in here sucks.

01:14:18.758 --> 01:14:21.593
That's better. It's a little more intimate.

01:14:21.677 --> 01:14:23.634
sets the mood.

01:14:23.721 --> 01:14:28.181
What's that, Ken? Is that an ice sculpture?
somebody win that? Is this raffled off?

01:14:28.267 --> 01:14:30.674
Is this something you do
in your part time?

01:14:30.769 --> 01:14:33.604
Between the kidnapping
and the drugs and the murders?

01:14:33.689 --> 01:14:35.681
You make that yourself, Ken?

01:14:36.775 --> 01:14:39.147
Who is that, Ken? Is that you?

01:14:39.236 --> 01:14:40.647
No, that's Zeus.

01:14:45.408 --> 01:14:47.484
I hate mythology.

01:14:48.286 --> 01:14:51.204
Well, Mr Halstead,
surprised to see you here.

01:14:51.289 --> 01:14:53.661
Don't be tense. Just relax.

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:56.419
You know, most of you
look like very nice people.

01:14:56.502 --> 01:14:59.289
It surprises me that you're here,
mixing with scum.

01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:02.501
I mean, the kind of scum
that kidnaps my girlfriend.

01:15:03.009 --> 01:15:05.879
You're making a terrible mistake.

01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:08.258
Does that look like a mistake to you?

01:15:08.347 --> 01:15:12.890
- Does that look like a 9mm mistake?
- Put it down, mister! Drop it, mister!

01:15:12.977 --> 01:15:16.760
Tell me if it's a mistake to blow
your brains against the wall, Lyman.

01:15:16.855 --> 01:15:19.607
- Where is she?!
- Dooley, put the gun down.

01:15:19.691 --> 01:15:22.858
- Gimme the gun, Dooley.
- shame you have to leave so early.

01:15:22.944 --> 01:15:26.444
- You really are the life of the party.
- You're goin' down, Lyman.

01:15:26.531 --> 01:15:28.856
Perhaps next time
you can bring your lady friend.

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:32.782
- You're goin' down, Lyman.
- see? see? The man is a lunatic.

01:15:32.871 --> 01:15:36.074
- Outta controI.
- You can arrest me, Lyman! Go ahead!

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:38.573
- But you know what?
- I'll have you prosecuted!

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:43.164
I'll make baiI in 24 hours, and they'll
have to peeI me off you with a crowbar!

01:15:43.256 --> 01:15:45.462
You're goin' down, buddy!

01:15:45.549 --> 01:15:48.883
I'm gonna have your ass
behind bars permanently!

01:15:50.054 --> 01:15:53.257
And get that damn dog off my table.

01:15:54.933 --> 01:15:58.302
Just let me outta
this goddamn cage, will ya?

01:16:03.817 --> 01:16:05.975
Byers! Byers!

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:10.277
Rog, Rog. Jesus, am I glad you're here,
man. Cut me loose now, will ya?

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:14.943
- You blew it. You are out of controI.
- No, I tried to convince Lyman I'm crazy.

01:16:15.036 --> 01:16:17.907
- I got news for you: you are crazy.
- Listen to me, Roger.

01:16:17.997 --> 01:16:22.244
Lyman's got Tracy. He kidnapped her
to keep me from that shipment.

01:16:22.335 --> 01:16:25.205
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- sure you would. You always do.

01:16:25.296 --> 01:16:29.543
Not this. I'm tellin' you the truth. I got
an answering-machine tape to prove it.

01:16:29.633 --> 01:16:33.845
I had to put this move on, to convince
Lyman that I was nuts. I had to con him.

01:16:33.929 --> 01:16:38.840
Put yourself in his position. He thinks
for the next 24 hours I'm behind bars.

01:16:38.934 --> 01:16:42.634
What would you do? You'd move that
shipment of dope before I made baiI.

01:16:42.729 --> 01:16:45.516
That's what you'd do.
The deaI is goin' down tonight.

01:16:45.607 --> 01:16:47.979
I gotta be there. You gotta let me out now.

01:16:48.068 --> 01:16:53.489
I don't wanna hear it. It's your bullshit
that got Tracy involved in the first place.

01:16:53.573 --> 01:16:55.898
From here on in,
this is a coordinated effort.

01:16:55.992 --> 01:16:58.946
That means you, me,
and the rest of the department.

01:16:59.078 --> 01:17:01.071
Let's go.

01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:16.552
- Oh, what is that?!
- God, who let that one go?

01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:20.302
- How could you fart in a closed car?
- He did it. He ate chilli today.

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.510
- I'm rollin' my window down.
- You gotta let him go.

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:25.760
- Pull over, would you?
- I'm pulling over.

01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:28.559
- Get some air in here.
- There he goes again.

01:17:28.648 --> 01:17:32.183
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm the one
stuck in the back seat here.

01:17:32.277 --> 01:17:34.269
- I'm pullin' over.
- It stinks.

01:17:43.704 --> 01:17:45.863
You're gonna lose your badge, go to jaiI.

01:17:45.957 --> 01:17:49.207
Every minute we wait,
there's another chance Tracy'll get hurt.

01:17:49.293 --> 01:17:54.002
- I don't care. You're outta controI.
- I'm not outta controI. It was a planned...

01:17:54.089 --> 01:17:57.174
- How long will it take this dog to piss?
- I don't know.

01:17:57.259 --> 01:18:00.046
OK, come on. Let's go.
Get him back in here!

01:18:00.137 --> 01:18:02.806
I can't find him.
I don't know where he went.

01:18:07.936 --> 01:18:11.636
- Get the damn dog.
- I don't know where he is.

01:18:12.148 --> 01:18:14.770
Down here a minute ago.
I don't know where he went.

01:18:14.859 --> 01:18:18.560
- Where the hell did he go?
- Jerry Lee, shake it off! Let's go!

01:18:22.992 --> 01:18:25.946
I really need this.
Waiting for some mutt...

01:18:26.037 --> 01:18:28.492
Come here, boy. Hold them.

01:18:29.957 --> 01:18:32.531
- What is this?
- He's tense. You rushed him.

01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:35.374
Get in the back seat.

01:18:35.588 --> 01:18:38.505
He's very touchy about that back seat.

01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:40.998
You're in deep enough as it is.
Now call him off.

01:18:41.093 --> 01:18:44.925
Hey, no way. Once he gets somethin'
into his head, there's nothing I can do.

01:18:45.013 --> 01:18:48.678
- Look at him. He's nuts!
- Damn it, Dooley, this is it.

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:51.554
I have no time for
coordinated efforts, understand?

01:18:51.645 --> 01:18:54.017
They move that load, and Tracy's dead.

01:18:55.982 --> 01:18:57.809
Jerry Lee, come!

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.353
Damn it, Dooley!

01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:15.245
OK, this is how it works.
The guy moves, he jumps into the clear,

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:19.118
I shoot and...

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:23.162
And I miss and I lose. Great.

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:26.959
It's supposed to make this great big noise,
like applause, if you win.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:30.423
I can only assume that's true,
because I've never won.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:35.137
They gotta show up soon.
I mean, the stash is here.

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:37.849
You know, we find them, we'll find her.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:41.308
I know it's a long shot,
but it's the only shot we got, right?

01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:43.109
Right?

01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:51.608
You know, I met her on the beach
in La Jolla about four years ago.

01:19:51.702 --> 01:19:53.825
I was in a toilet with these binoculars.

01:19:53.913 --> 01:19:57.246
I was checkin' out these kids
selling some weed down on the beach.

01:19:57.333 --> 01:19:59.409
It was hot that day.

01:19:59.501 --> 01:20:01.743
That bathroom smelled like...

01:20:01.837 --> 01:20:04.043
well, a lot like you do, you know?

01:20:04.131 --> 01:20:08.709
so I'm scopin' out the sand, and bam!
I come across this goddess.

01:20:09.845 --> 01:20:14.637
Forget the kids. I'm not watchin'
the kids any more, I'm watchin' her.

01:20:14.724 --> 01:20:16.847
she's reading, right?

01:20:16.935 --> 01:20:20.600
she stops, she puts the book down,

01:20:20.688 --> 01:20:24.638
she reaches into her pocket
and pulls out a chapstick.

01:20:24.734 --> 01:20:26.857
And she puts it to her lips.

01:20:28.696 --> 01:20:30.605
All right, I'm goin' nuts.

01:20:30.698 --> 01:20:34.992
I know it's just a chapstick, but it's the
most erotic thing I've ever seen in my life.

01:20:35.077 --> 01:20:38.861
All of a sudden I feeI reaI uncomfortable,
like I'm invading her privacy.

01:20:38.956 --> 01:20:43.119
I'm feelin' sleazy, which is really weird
because I usually like that feeling.

01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:47.623
so anyway, I get up. I walk toward her,
you know, I go out of the john.

01:20:47.714 --> 01:20:52.257
I'm sweatin' like a whore in church.
I got toilet paper draggin' around my feet.

01:20:52.344 --> 01:20:57.089
I look like I should be in a straitjacket.
I walk up, look down at her, she looks up.

01:20:57.807 --> 01:20:59.800
she pulls these glasses down.

01:21:01.144 --> 01:21:06.814
she says to me "I'm reading Journey
to the End of the Night, by Celine. "

01:21:06.899 --> 01:21:09.022
"The originaI French version. "

01:21:09.861 --> 01:21:11.853
"Have you read it?"

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.401
Have I read it, she asks, right?

01:21:16.158 --> 01:21:20.286
I mean, she just naturally assumes
I'm, like, this regular person.

01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:23.822
Not some schmo cop. Have I read it?

01:21:26.293 --> 01:21:29.543
Well, of course I didn't read it,
but, I mean, you know.

01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:32.037
she just, like, looked at me, you know.

01:21:33.759 --> 01:21:36.214
God, I loved her for that, you know.

01:21:38.471 --> 01:21:40.464
What's the matter?

01:21:43.309 --> 01:21:45.302
Hello.

01:21:56.113 --> 01:21:58.948
Halstead. Damn.

01:21:59.033 --> 01:22:01.025
Left the party too early, buddy.

01:22:13.046 --> 01:22:18.004
Oh, bingo. Red Mercedes.
Here we are. We're on, buddy.

01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:32.188
Halstead! Pull over to the side of the road!

01:22:33.691 --> 01:22:36.478
Come on, Halstead, call it a night!

01:23:30.454 --> 01:23:31.948
Arghhh!

01:23:39.296 --> 01:23:41.454
I'll be damned.

01:23:50.265 --> 01:23:53.100
- I shoulda killed him.
- You shoulda ducked.

01:23:54.977 --> 01:23:58.892
I could've taken him out right there.
Then he'd be done. End of story.

01:23:58.981 --> 01:24:02.432
Dooley is yours.
The girI is yours. A gift from me.

01:24:02.526 --> 01:24:06.987
Make it as messy and painfuI as you
want, but later. Right now I need you here.

01:24:07.072 --> 01:24:11.200
Concentrate. Focus on
the business at hand.

01:24:11.285 --> 01:24:13.526
- Halstead is late.
- What's a few minutes?

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:17.238
Halstead is never late.
sculley, pour me a brandy, will ya?

01:24:17.332 --> 01:24:19.325
I'll get it.

01:24:26.508 --> 01:24:28.547
How you doin', sweet pants?

01:24:29.886 --> 01:24:32.637
I can't wait to bump into your boyfriend.

01:24:33.765 --> 01:24:35.923
Hell, I might even pay his baiI.

01:24:36.434 --> 01:24:39.933
see, I got a present for him.
A Colombian necktie.

01:24:40.896 --> 01:24:42.889
Know what that is?

01:24:43.482 --> 01:24:47.183
First you slit his throat, then you reach in,
grab his tongue, rip it out,

01:24:47.278 --> 01:24:50.113
and you just leave it
hangin' like a necktie.

01:24:50.197 --> 01:24:52.522
And you and me gonna party, babe.

01:24:53.992 --> 01:24:55.866
Why not?

01:24:57.454 --> 01:24:59.945
Come here.

01:25:00.999 --> 01:25:02.992
Come here.

01:25:04.336 --> 01:25:06.328
Oh, God.

01:25:07.255 --> 01:25:09.248
You bitch!

01:25:10.842 --> 01:25:14.045
Well, it's about time.

01:25:16.806 --> 01:25:18.217
Later.

01:25:42.038 --> 01:25:44.825
- You're late!
- Yeah, traffic's a bitch.

01:25:45.959 --> 01:25:48.331
Hey, bad idea.

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.708
- I press this and the cocaine goes boom.
- Easy.

01:25:50.797 --> 01:25:53.714
I got 20 pounds
of explosives in this truck.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.836
This little baby here sends a signaI,
we got liftoff.

01:25:56.928 --> 01:26:00.094
It snows in san Diego.

01:26:00.181 --> 01:26:03.384
Look, Lyman, I got somethin' you want,
you got somethin' I want.

01:26:03.476 --> 01:26:07.520
I don't care about you or your drugs
any more. I want the girI and I want out.

01:26:13.026 --> 01:26:15.482
sculley! Bring the girI.

01:26:24.037 --> 01:26:26.279
It's gonna be all right, honey.

01:26:26.373 --> 01:26:29.539
It's gonna be all right, baby.
We'll be outta here.

01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:34.746
You know what?
I think you're connin' me.

01:26:35.673 --> 01:26:38.591
I think I should have Dillon here
just cut you in half.

01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:41.503
Go ahead.

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:44.589
Go ahead!

01:26:45.975 --> 01:26:48.810
Here comes your helicopter.

01:26:49.603 --> 01:26:52.225
Here comes your 50 million.

01:26:52.314 --> 01:26:56.442
Boy, I'd sure hate to waste that
on a dumb cop and his girlfriend.

01:26:58.612 --> 01:27:00.604
What's it gonna be, Lyman?

01:27:07.871 --> 01:27:09.947
Cut her loose.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.992
You're a dead man, Dooley.

01:27:14.085 --> 01:27:17.288
I'll find ya. And when I do,
I'm gonna kill ya.

01:27:19.424 --> 01:27:21.416
Walk.

01:27:46.241 --> 01:27:48.530
Jerry, get off him!

01:27:50.036 --> 01:27:51.828
Get off!

01:27:52.789 --> 01:27:55.161
Jerry, off!

01:28:56.058 --> 01:28:58.430
- Jesus!
- We gotta get him outta here.

01:28:58.519 --> 01:29:00.511
Cover him, cover him.

01:29:02.856 --> 01:29:05.429
- Come on.
- It's all right, buddy.

01:29:11.906 --> 01:29:13.899
It's all right, buddy.

01:29:17.203 --> 01:29:19.279
It's OK, buddy. Hang in there.

01:29:54.864 --> 01:29:57.865
Gunshot wound. Can you show me
which way to Emergency?

01:29:57.951 --> 01:30:00.702
- sir, that is a dog.
- Yes, it's a dog and he's been shot.

01:30:00.787 --> 01:30:03.278
- This is a hospitaI.
- I'm a police officer, lady.

01:30:03.373 --> 01:30:06.160
- You can't bring that dog in here.
- He's bleeding to death.

01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:09.085
- We don't treat animals.
- I don't have time to argue.

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:11.293
Can you just show me
where the doctors are?

01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:16.125
- If you don't leave right now...
- I'm not leaving, lady. I'm not leaving.

01:30:16.218 --> 01:30:19.338
- There isn't anyone here...
- I just want one of your doctors.

01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:23.297
None of them can help you. sit back
in the reception room and we'll try and...

01:30:23.392 --> 01:30:25.847
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
Are you a doctor?

01:30:25.936 --> 01:30:29.139
- What the hell is this?
- He says he's a police officer.

01:30:29.231 --> 01:30:31.686
I told him he couldn't
bring the dog in here.

01:30:31.775 --> 01:30:33.933
I have an emergency here.
I need your help.

01:30:34.027 --> 01:30:37.727
- What's your problem?
- It's him. He's been shot in the chest.

01:30:37.822 --> 01:30:40.989
- You need to work on him now.
- There are health regulations.

01:30:41.075 --> 01:30:45.073
I don't care about that. I can't take him
anywhere else. He's not gonna make it.

01:30:45.163 --> 01:30:47.535
Look, either you help him now
or he's gonna die.

01:30:47.623 --> 01:30:50.375
Don't get so excited. It's just a dog.

01:30:50.459 --> 01:30:53.033
He's not "just" a dog.

01:30:54.171 --> 01:30:57.172
He's a cop. And he's not just
any cop. He's my partner.

01:30:59.051 --> 01:31:01.293
Do you know about medicine?

01:31:01.386 --> 01:31:03.545
Do you know how to remove a bullet?

01:31:07.559 --> 01:31:09.682
I can remove the bullet.

01:31:10.145 --> 01:31:13.395
I need some help in here!
Let's move this dog now.

01:31:13.481 --> 01:31:15.474
Let's go. Come on.

01:31:18.236 --> 01:31:21.605
He's gonna be fine.
He's gonna be all right. He's tough.

01:31:21.698 --> 01:31:26.490
Did I tell you what he did in the bar?
He saved my ass in the bar, Jerry Lee.

01:31:26.577 --> 01:31:30.657
I mean, that's his job. His job is
to take a bullet. That's what K-9s are for.

01:31:30.748 --> 01:31:33.998
To take the bullet to save people.
That's exactly what he did.

01:31:34.085 --> 01:31:38.912
He went between me and Lyman.
He took the bullet. That's what they're for.

01:31:40.007 --> 01:31:41.715
He's a goddamn dog, that's all.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:46.012
And that's what he did. He went
between me and Lyman. He took the hit.

01:31:48.432 --> 01:31:51.883
He's just... just bleedin'. He bled a lot.

01:32:10.369 --> 01:32:13.240
You know, I've been after Lyman
for two years.

01:32:14.373 --> 01:32:17.409
Two years. And it wasn't worth it.

01:32:19.962 --> 01:32:22.916
It just wasn't worth it.
You could have gotten killed.

01:32:23.006 --> 01:32:25.924
You too, but we didn't.
You're a good cop, Dooley.

01:32:26.009 --> 01:32:28.381
Yeah, yeah, right. shoot.

01:32:30.764 --> 01:32:32.970
I can't take this any more.

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:17.132
Jerry Lee?

01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:28.101
Jerry?

01:33:29.779 --> 01:33:32.270
Jerry Lee, can you hear me?

01:33:35.534 --> 01:33:40.529
I wish you could hear me, because there's
a couple of things I wanted to tell you.

01:33:40.623 --> 01:33:42.864
You know, like, uh...

01:33:43.667 --> 01:33:47.879
Like I know our relationship
was a little rocky. OK?

01:33:47.963 --> 01:33:50.880
And I know we didn't exactly
click as partners.

01:33:51.466 --> 01:33:54.669
And the way it looks now,
it doesn't look like we ever will.

01:33:54.761 --> 01:33:58.095
I never had a dog before. I didn't know
what you were supposed to do.

01:33:58.181 --> 01:34:01.680
I should have got a book and read
about it, is what I should have done.

01:34:01.768 --> 01:34:05.433
But I do know now that I shouldn't
have yelled at you. I yelled at you a lot.

01:34:05.521 --> 01:34:08.558
Even though you took the mirror
off my Mustang, you know.

01:34:08.649 --> 01:34:13.691
'65 classic Mustang,
which I love. I love that car.

01:34:13.779 --> 01:34:17.991
But it's OK. It's OK, because I know
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

01:34:18.075 --> 01:34:22.120
You know, and... and I know
it wasn't all your fault.

01:34:22.204 --> 01:34:24.873
I mean, it could have been
partially my fault and...

01:34:24.957 --> 01:34:29.286
OK, it was probably more my fault
than yours, and I feeI bad about that.

01:34:29.378 --> 01:34:31.370
And I'm sorry.

01:34:32.255 --> 01:34:36.668
You know, I mean, I locked you up
in closets all night and yelled at you.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.752
I put you through a car wash.

01:34:40.221 --> 01:34:45.263
What else? I kicked you outta bed while
I was trying to make love with Tracy.

01:34:45.351 --> 01:34:48.436
That was very insensitive of me.
I know that now.

01:34:49.063 --> 01:34:51.981
And we should have went to Vegas,
is what we should have done.

01:34:52.066 --> 01:34:55.316
If you were around right now,
that's what we'd do - we'd go to Vegas.

01:34:55.403 --> 01:34:58.606
For the weekend, you know.
We'd pick up a couple of broads.

01:34:58.698 --> 01:35:02.362
I'd take Tracy, and we could pick up
that little poodle with the shaved beak.

01:35:02.451 --> 01:35:06.947
she was hot. Ooh, she was sexy.
I'd even let you sleep with us.

01:35:07.039 --> 01:35:12.033
I mean, down at the bottom of the bed,
you know, not in between us again.

01:35:12.127 --> 01:35:15.792
- That was a little rough.
- There you are. Been lookin' for ya.

01:35:15.881 --> 01:35:20.507
- You're not allowed in the recovery room.
- Yeah, I know. I was just, uh...

01:35:20.594 --> 01:35:24.259
- Recovery room?
- Yeah, this is the recovery room.

01:35:24.931 --> 01:35:28.679
- You mean, this is where patients, uh...?
- Come to recover.

01:35:30.311 --> 01:35:33.312
- so the dog is...?
- Gonna be just fine.

01:35:36.025 --> 01:35:38.018
Oh.

01:35:38.736 --> 01:35:41.772
- Can I have just a couple of minutes?
- No problem.

01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:50.327
You asshole.

01:35:51.832 --> 01:35:54.501
Were you listening to everything I said?

01:35:54.584 --> 01:35:59.542
Well, you can just forget all of it, because
I thought I was talkin' to a dead dog!

01:36:00.048 --> 01:36:06.051
I wouldn't take a sneaky, manipulative,
Iying flea circus like you anywhere,

01:36:06.137 --> 01:36:08.889
let alone Vegas. Vegas? Forget it.

01:36:08.973 --> 01:36:12.591
The dog - the poodle with
the shaved beak that you love so much?

01:36:12.685 --> 01:36:14.678
Eat your heart out.

01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:17.888
Oh, God.

01:36:18.065 --> 01:36:20.639
You don't deserve to live. You know that?

01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.692
