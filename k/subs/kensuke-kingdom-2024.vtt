02:36.125 --> 02:38.707
Michael, I thought
you were swabbing the deck.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.082
Mum.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.874
When can I do something fun?

02:41.875 --> 02:44.625
Why don't you come up here?
Help me steer.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.582
Try and give it a chance, sweetheart.

02:52.583 --> 02:53.790
When I started sailing,

02:53.791 --> 02:56.499
I had to learn
all the daily chores, too.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.790
But you'll soon
get the hang of it.

02:57.791 --> 02:58.999
And before you know it,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.416
the <i>Peggy Sue</i> will feel
just like home.

03:02.166 --> 03:03.832
Aye aye, Skipper.

03:07.666 --> 03:08.625
Come on, you.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.249
Skipper's hat off.

03:13.250 --> 03:16.707
This is Mum
speaking now, okay?

03:16.708 --> 03:19.582
I know this is a bit of
a re-adjustment, love,

03:19.583 --> 03:21.249
but when your dad and I
lost our jobs,

03:21.250 --> 03:23.082
we wanted to make
the best of things.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.582
- Yeah. That's it, you got it.
-We needed a fresh start.

03:25.583 --> 03:29.500
All of us, together,
exploring the world.

03:30.375 --> 03:31.957
Not quite all of us.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.874
You didn't wanna bring Stella.

03:33.875 --> 03:37.332
Oh, love, we all miss Stella.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.249
But a boat
is no place for a dog.

03:40.250 --> 03:42.665
You know that, sweetheart.

03:42.666 --> 03:45.540
I bet right now she's having
the time of her life

03:45.541 --> 03:47.041
digging up
Uncle Pete's garden.

03:48.375 --> 03:49.915
Michael, look!

03:49.916 --> 03:51.290
Dolphins!

03:58.583 --> 04:01.333
See? It's not
all boring chores.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.499
Hmm. Hi, Dad.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.499
I've got something for you.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.374
Yeah?

04:12.375 --> 04:16.374
It is my privilege
to bestow upon you the honour

04:16.375 --> 04:19.250
of being the keeper of
the log book of the <i>Peggy Sue.</i>

04:25.708 --> 04:26.749
What's a log book?

04:26.750 --> 04:28.290
It's like a diary

04:28.291 --> 04:30.332
of all the fantastic things
we'll see.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.832
And all the exciting places
we'll go.

04:32.833 --> 04:36.957
And here, have a look.
There's a map inside.

04:36.958 --> 04:40.540
You can chart our incredible
journey around the globe.

04:40.541 --> 04:44.665
West Africa, South Africa,
India, Indonesia,

04:44.666 --> 04:46.458
- Australia, Japan...
- Why?

04:47.500 --> 04:48.499
"Why"?

04:48.500 --> 04:49.583
What do you mean, "Why"?

04:53.458 --> 04:55.333
Well, anyway...

04:57.208 --> 04:58.916
It was your mum's idea, okay?

05:15.791 --> 05:16.791
Missed a bit.

05:17.541 --> 05:19.833
Ah!

05:22.541 --> 05:23.874
I'm getting good
at this bit.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.624
Did someone
say "biscuit"?

05:25.625 --> 05:27.500
Okay,
I'll go and get them.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.666
Who took all the biscuits?

05:40.250 --> 05:41.290
Dad, look!

05:41.291 --> 05:43.832
Michael's not fastened.

05:43.833 --> 05:46.124
Oh, Mike. How many times?

05:47.166 --> 05:48.999
You stay clipped all the time.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.332
No exceptions.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.915
Okay?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.375
Aye aye, Skipper.

05:54.666 --> 05:57.999
Becky, I am putting you
on second watch tonight.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.374
I could do a watch, too.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.583
Not just yet, sailor.

06:03.583 --> 06:04.625
Not just yet.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.666
This is amazing.

06:30.541 --> 06:35.124
So many you can barely
make out the constellations.

06:35.125 --> 06:38.457
If you know where to look,
you can use them to steer by.

06:38.458 --> 06:41.582
- Can you?
- Me? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Nah...

06:41.583 --> 06:43.832
Your mum's getting
pretty good at it, though.

06:43.833 --> 06:45.165
You can't do it from books.

06:45.166 --> 06:48.332
You see, Becky,
you have to learn by doing it.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.000
Ah, look at that.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.499
Wow.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.832
Now, that is
the magic of the night watch.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.415
Well, I suppose...

07:00.416 --> 07:01.707
Night, Dad.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.040
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

07:03.041 --> 07:04.207
Yes, Dad.

07:04.208 --> 07:05.457
All right, all right.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.207
But if you're worried
about anything at all,

07:07.208 --> 07:08.707
you just shout, okay?

07:08.708 --> 07:10.249
- Okay.
- All right.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.125
- Night, sweetheart.
- Night, Dad.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.040
Bloody hell. Don't do that.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.124
You're supposed to be asleep.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.874
If you want,
you could go back to bed.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.457
I'll look after things here.

07:43.458 --> 07:46.457
Dad asked me
to look after things here.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.749
He's never gonna
ask me, is he?

07:48.750 --> 07:49.999
He thinks I'm an idiot.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.041
I think you're an idiot.

07:52.875 --> 07:54.458
- Come on, let me do it.
- Get off.

08:00.416 --> 08:02.791
I'll swab the deck for a week.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.165
What?

08:05.166 --> 08:06.874
If you let me
do the night watch.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.750
I'll swab the deck for a week.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.291
Month.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.208
Deal.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.208
-  Really?
- Uh-huh!

08:23.416 --> 08:24.708
What are you after?

08:25.750 --> 08:26.750
Nothing.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.958
Okay...

08:29.791 --> 08:30.750
You're on.

08:36.291 --> 08:38.041
- Now, you know what to do?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:39.916 --> 08:42.374
- Do not mess up.
- I won't.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.625
You'd better not.

08:51.625 --> 08:54.000
- Month.
- Yeah, yeah. Just go to bed.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.749
Ah!

09:25.750 --> 09:27.832
Good girl.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.582
Good girl, Stella.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.583
Good girl.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.041
Good girl, Stella.

09:36.625 --> 09:37.957
No, no, no!

09:37.958 --> 09:39.624
Stella, Stella!

09:39.625 --> 09:41.124
Come here. Come back here.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.374
Stella... Argh!

09:42.375 --> 09:44.374
Stella, come here.

09:45.583 --> 09:48.249
Come here. Stella!

09:49.333 --> 09:51.458
-Man overboard!
- Becky!

09:52.208 --> 09:53.957
Becky?

09:53.958 --> 09:55.040
Becky!

09:55.041 --> 09:57.290
What? Mum, I'm here, I'm here.

09:57.291 --> 09:58.749
- Michael.
- What's going on?

09:58.750 --> 09:59.999
- Michael!
- Becky,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.582
- why aren't you at the wheel?
-Michael!

10:01.583 --> 10:02.749
Mum and Dad, over here!

10:02.750 --> 10:04.790
- Oh, my God. Michael!
- Michael!

10:04.791 --> 10:05.957
Help!
Stella?

10:05.958 --> 10:07.457
Don't drop him.
Get Michael.

10:07.458 --> 10:08.624
She's slipping!

10:08.625 --> 10:10.790
-Oh, my God.
- I can't hold her.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.665
Quick...

10:14.666 --> 10:15.957
Argh!

10:15.958 --> 10:17.999
Becky. Becky, help.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.999
Help! Pull. Pull!

10:31.166 --> 10:32.582
Michael,
you could have been killed.

10:32.583 --> 10:33.915
One of us
could have been killed.

10:33.916 --> 10:36.082
I was just
starting to count on you.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.499
I thought you were growing up.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.915
How long
were you planning

10:38.916 --> 10:40.499
to keep her in the cupboard,
Michael? The whole year?

10:40.500 --> 10:44.165
I told you, love.
A boat is no place for a dog.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.457
Right.
The next port of call,

10:45.458 --> 10:46.999
she is going in a dog's home.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.125
No!

11:12.250 --> 11:15.165
He's not really gonna
put Stella in a home, is he?

11:15.166 --> 11:16.583
You know your dad.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.665
We should put Michael
in a home.

11:20.666 --> 11:22.124
Becky!

11:54.041 --> 11:55.832
Come here,
you silly old thing.

11:55.833 --> 11:56.874
Come here.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.499
Good girl.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.749
Get off.

12:07.625 --> 12:08.957
Okay, she can stay.

12:08.958 --> 12:10.374
Yay!

12:10.375 --> 12:12.582
But, she's never allowed
in the living quarters.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.332
Ever. And the locker
is now her kennel.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.499
And... Oh, come on.
Get out of here.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.749
Get out of here.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.041
Come on.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.124
And swab the deck,
you hear me?

12:22.125 --> 12:23.374
Aye aye, Skipper.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.332
Eh, he's not the Skipper.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.332
Gross.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.416
Michael,
clear all that stuff away.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.665
Argh. It's bad out there.

13:56.666 --> 13:58.915
I've secured what I can.
I think she'll hold.

13:58.916 --> 14:01.541
Well, let's hope so. Now,
come and have a look at this.

14:02.458 --> 14:04.499
The nearest land
is a day away.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.999
You think we can outrun it?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.999
No, it's too late. We're just
gonna have to weather it.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.874
Isn't there even
a tiny island somewhere?

14:09.875 --> 14:11.665
We're in
the middle of nowhere.

14:11.666 --> 14:13.540
If we'd only held back a bit.

14:13.541 --> 14:15.040
But if we can
get to here,

14:15.041 --> 14:16.207
maybe a bit more shelter?

14:16.208 --> 14:17.874
And wait for it
to blow past.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.040
We need to get Stella
from her kennel.

14:20.041 --> 14:22.540
But what if we head this way?
Or this?

14:22.541 --> 14:24.540
No,
this is our only option.

14:24.541 --> 14:26.249
Someone needs to get Stella!

14:26.250 --> 14:27.915
God knows
the size of these swells.

14:27.916 --> 14:28.999
Could be anything below us

14:29.000 --> 14:30.582
and we won't know
until it's too late.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.082
What's this?

14:33.083 --> 14:34.624
Where? I don't know.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.457
I can't see
in this bloody light.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.124
Let's just focus
on one thing at a time.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.540
Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:39.541 --> 14:41.290
No! No, you don't.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.540
Argh! I need to get Stella.

14:43.541 --> 14:45.874
Michael. It's much
too dangerous out there.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.832
- Michael!
- Let go!

14:51.166 --> 14:52.707
Dad!

14:53.791 --> 14:55.875
Michael, no!

15:12.333 --> 15:13.291
Stella.

15:16.000 --> 15:16.958
Come on.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.250
Whoa. Come on.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.500
Michael!

15:26.000 --> 15:27.666
Hurry, Michael. Quick!

15:28.916 --> 15:30.291
No!

15:33.166 --> 15:34.957
Michael!

15:46.291 --> 15:49.375
No. Michael!

16:10.875 --> 16:12.749
Help!

16:12.750 --> 16:14.791
Help!

16:15.666 --> 16:16.833
Help...

16:26.791 --> 16:28.208
Stella, Stella!

16:28.958 --> 16:30.665
Stella, help!

16:59.666 --> 17:01.207
<i>Michael, Michael.</i>

18:14.750 --> 18:15.749
Mum!

18:19.833 --> 18:21.082
Dad!

18:24.000 --> 18:25.624
Becky!

18:28.041 --> 18:29.333
Mum!

18:48.666 --> 18:49.874
Becky!

18:53.833 --> 18:55.166
Mum!

18:56.375 --> 18:59.124
Dad!

19:57.250 --> 19:58.208
Stella.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.750
<i>Whoa. Look at that.</i>

21:04.041 --> 21:07.416
Dad. Where are you?

21:13.583 --> 21:15.625
Where are you?

22:35.541 --> 22:36.665
It's okay.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.166
Hmm.

22:50.333 --> 22:51.541
Hello?

23:43.166 --> 23:45.041
Please, please, please,
please, please. Come on.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.415
Mmm...

25:02.583 --> 25:03.791
Help me.

25:50.791 --> 25:54.125
Thank you.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.833
Mmm. Mmm.

26:11.208 --> 26:12.250
Mmm.

26:15.291 --> 26:16.416
Hello?

26:17.708 --> 26:19.958
Who are you?

26:25.583 --> 26:26.582
I need your help!

26:47.125 --> 26:48.250
Ugh.

26:54.041 --> 26:56.000
Ugh. Ah.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.000
Come on.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.707
Yes!

28:50.791 --> 28:51.791
Want some?

28:54.875 --> 28:57.041
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

29:01.625 --> 29:02.707
What is it, girl?

29:18.083 --> 29:21.207
Hey! Help!

29:21.208 --> 29:24.082
I'm here! Help!

29:24.083 --> 29:28.083
Hey, hey! Help! Help!

29:36.333 --> 29:38.207
Wait. Wait, please!

29:38.208 --> 29:40.333
Please, help me!

29:42.666 --> 29:44.165
No, no, no. Come back!

29:44.166 --> 29:45.915
I need your help!

29:51.500 --> 29:53.374
I don't know
what you're saying.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.874
Wait. Listen.

29:54.875 --> 29:56.290
Ah.

30:07.916 --> 30:09.208
Where are you going?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.708
Why can't I come with you?

30:24.125 --> 30:25.083
Come on, girl.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.833
Why won't you help me?

30:45.416 --> 30:46.541
Hmm.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.541
I don't need you, anyway.

31:23.833 --> 31:25.791
I can catch my own fish.

31:31.916 --> 31:34.540
I don't
understand what you're saying.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.999
I'm catching my own fish.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.165
Help!

33:20.750 --> 33:21.750
Huh.

33:52.708 --> 33:55.125
Hmm.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.208
This place is amazing.

35:00.916 --> 35:02.875
You have
running water.

35:14.625 --> 35:17.083
You have a shower?

35:18.208 --> 35:19.583
How can you have a shower?

35:22.916 --> 35:25.040
Oh, my God.

35:36.666 --> 35:38.125
Whoa.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.625
Did you build all this?

36:06.041 --> 36:08.457
Wow.

36:31.291 --> 36:33.500
You make your own brushes.

36:36.750 --> 36:37.749
Who's this?

36:37.750 --> 36:40.082
What? Oh, please, let's see...

38:39.083 --> 38:40.250
Hello?

38:42.083 --> 38:43.083
Hmm.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.041
Oh. Hello, girl.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.041
Hello?

39:00.708 --> 39:01.833
Hello?

39:06.833 --> 39:08.000
Whoa.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.083
No. No, Stella, wait!

39:55.250 --> 39:56.708
Hello?

40:09.708 --> 40:10.666
Huh.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.125
Hello?

40:24.375 --> 40:26.041
Ah! Stella!

40:31.458 --> 40:32.458
Okay.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.541
Oh.

41:21.833 --> 41:24.125
Whoa.

42:09.291 --> 42:10.333
Whoa.

42:31.166 --> 42:32.665
No, no, Stella.  Ah!

43:14.208 --> 43:15.125
Hmm.

43:16.916 --> 43:18.040
I'm sorry.

43:18.041 --> 43:20.416
I... I didn't mean to.

44:40.875 --> 44:41.958
My log book.

44:53.333 --> 44:54.333
Who's that?

44:56.791 --> 44:57.875
Is that your family?

45:06.500 --> 45:08.124
This is my family

45:08.125 --> 45:11.540
on our boat, the <i>Peggy Sue.</i>

45:11.541 --> 45:15.041
That's Mum, Dad,
and my sister Becky.

45:19.416 --> 45:20.875
Where are your family?

47:58.083 --> 47:59.250
Nagasaki.

48:01.875 --> 48:03.250
What's Nagasaki?

48:13.250 --> 48:14.750
This is you, isn't it?

48:16.041 --> 48:17.458
You were a soldier.

48:19.416 --> 48:21.916
How long have you been here?

48:23.875 --> 48:26.583
This isn't when
you last saw them, is it?

48:33.875 --> 48:36.416
I wonder when
I'll see my family again.

49:17.416 --> 49:18.540
Kensuke.

49:24.708 --> 49:25.666
Kensuke.

49:28.083 --> 49:29.125
Kensuke.

49:33.291 --> 49:34.291
Michael.

49:36.500 --> 49:37.500
Michael.

49:39.500 --> 49:40.458
Hmm.

49:58.916 --> 50:00.416
Yeah!

50:11.083 --> 50:13.832
Oh.

50:20.416 --> 50:22.249
Fetch!

50:38.041 --> 50:40.541
Huh?

51:13.750 --> 51:15.625
Get off, get off,
get off! Shoo!

53:26.833 --> 53:27.791
Whoa.

53:28.833 --> 53:29.833
Kikanbo.

53:37.833 --> 53:38.875
Kikanbo.

53:45.541 --> 53:47.124
Tomodachi.

53:47.125 --> 53:48.250
Uh-huh.

55:28.458 --> 55:30.415
That's it,
Stella. Drop it. Drop it.

55:30.416 --> 55:32.250
Good girl.

55:49.500 --> 55:51.166
Mum? Dad?

56:08.416 --> 56:10.541
Wait, no. What are you...

56:53.333 --> 56:54.333
Who are they?

56:55.250 --> 56:56.290
What do they want?

57:42.750 --> 57:44.708
Tomodachi.

57:46.791 --> 57:47.750
Where's Kikanbo?

57:49.291 --> 57:50.250
Come back!

58:55.083 --> 58:57.624
Tomodachi?

59:01.500 --> 59:03.707
Kikanbo.

59:03.708 --> 59:04.750
Huh.

59:06.208 --> 59:07.250
Whoa!

59:08.375 --> 59:10.040
Whoa.

59:22.250 --> 59:23.500
Kikanbo, run!

59:34.875 --> 59:36.500
Yes!

59:41.000 --> 59:42.124
No!

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.208
Ah!

01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:25.583
Hey! Hey.

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:31.333
Come on.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.958
Come on.

01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:05.041
Ah!

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:38.625
Tomodachi?

01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:59.625
No. You've been hurt.

01:05:43.458 --> 01:05:44.541
Come on, Stella.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:46.333
Come on, girl.

01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:23.625
Come on, girl. Let go.

01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:53.083
Oh.

01:07:15.458 --> 01:07:16.708
I understand now.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.958
Why you didn't want
anyone to find you.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.624
You have to stay
and protect these guys.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:27.541
They're your family now.

01:09:59.833 --> 01:10:01.625
Go!

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.875
Come on.

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:44.790
Hmm.

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:45.875
Hmm.

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:51.416
See ya.

01:13:00.666 --> 01:13:01.708
<i>Kensuke.</i>

01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:03.875
<i>Michael.</i>

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:31.540
Wait. Stop!

01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:33.125
Stop! What are you...

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:35.832
What are you doing?

01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:37.332
People will see.

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:38.374
Ah.

01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:39.499
No!

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:43.458
We have to stay hidden.

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:45.791
Ah.

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:50.625
Michael.

01:13:53.041 --> 01:13:54.166
Michael.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:12.291
That's not the hunters.

01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:22.250
It's my family.

01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:25.000
It's my family!

01:14:27.916 --> 01:14:28.958
They found me.

01:14:32.958 --> 01:14:34.166
Come. Meet them.

01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:40.958
Kensuke.

01:14:43.416 --> 01:14:44.500
It's okay.

01:14:46.708 --> 01:14:48.125
They won't
tell anyone about you.

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:10.500
<i>Sayonara,</i> Stella.

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:52.041
Mm.

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.166
Oh, no, you don't.

01:16:58.166 --> 01:16:59.291
Stay hidden.

01:17:36.125 --> 01:17:38.291
Michael!

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.374
Becky!

01:17:40.375 --> 01:17:41.707
Oh, my God.

01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:43.082
Michael!

01:17:43.083 --> 01:17:45.040
Mum!

01:17:45.041 --> 01:17:46.708
Dad!

01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:11.749
Mum!

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:13.415
Michael!

01:18:13.416 --> 01:18:14.749
Aw, Stella.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:15.958
I'm okay!

01:18:17.416 --> 01:18:18.415
Michael!

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.291
Come here!

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.457
Michael, my boy.
