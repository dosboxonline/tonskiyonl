01:59.703 --> 02:01.705
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

02:09.253 --> 02:12.466
Sergeant, I'm here on behalf
of the Red Cross

02:12.633 --> 02:14.426
and I'd like to speak
with General Kitchener.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.261
There is
no General Kitchener here.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.889
Your Grace? Your Grace?
Let... Let him in.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.559
Well, if Morton's here, then
Kitchener can't be far away.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.645
My apologies, Your Grace.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.104
Security's paramount right now.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.315
It's a secret that you're
visiting with the general.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.275
We can't be too careful
with these Boers

02:30.359 --> 02:31.610
and their guerilla tactics.

02:31.777 --> 02:32.819
Too careful?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.489
Looks like this place
could use a lot more care.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.116
Begging your pardon, sir,
but these concentration camps

02:38.200 --> 02:39.451
are the reason we're winning this war.

02:39.743 --> 02:40.744
This way.

02:44.957 --> 02:49.336
Orlando. Our knight in shining armor.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.338
Thank you for coming.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.423
What's going on, Kitchener?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.676
It seems that you've been

02:55.759 --> 02:56.927
somewhat liberal with the truth.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.304
Time has not been kind here.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.181
Well, you'll have to explain that
to Emily.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.934
On my return to England,
it will be my first port of call.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.145

03:07.855 --> 03:09.982
Why are we here, Mother?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.443
Do you remember why
King Arthur and his knights

03:13.527 --> 03:14.987
had a round table?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.116
Because it meant
that all men were equal.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.369
It's important that people
born into privilege

03:22.452 --> 03:23.871
lead by example.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.124
That's why your father and I
are patrons of the Red Cross.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.501
Helping others,

03:29.668 --> 03:32.337
not hiding behind our status.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.802
Never forget that.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.470
Hmm?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.767
I'm just going to check
on your father.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.480
Stay here, Conrad.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.488
This terrible war would be over, Shola,

03:59.198 --> 04:02.784
if King Arthur and his
noble knights were still here.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.330
(CHUCKLES) Of course.
And which one would you be?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.665
I'd be Lancelot.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.793
Father would be Arthur.
Mother, Guinevere.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.088
And you, the mighty Merlin.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.173
Really?

04:17.466 --> 04:20.636
EMILY: This is ridiculous.
We're wasting precious time.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.804
Look around, people are dying.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.973
We have emergency supplies
from the Red Cross.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.683
Thank God she's on our side.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.268
Well, on my side, at least.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.478
KITCHENER: She's more of a force

04:29.561 --> 04:30.771
than any of our enemies.
(CHUCKLES)

04:30.854 --> 04:32.231
There's General Kitchener.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.817

That's it. I'm here.
You have to stay with me.

You have to stay with me.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.018
Protect our son.

05:52.895 --> 05:56.648
Protect him from this world. And...

05:57.691 --> 06:00.110
Never let him see war again.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.077

...up there, I feel free.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.897
Yes, I'm very much looking forward
to my first solo flight.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.232
Remember what happened
to Icarus, Conrad,

08:02.399 --> 08:04.484
when he flew too close to the sun.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.779
Well, I remember him
needing to escape, no?

08:07.946 --> 08:09.990
(LAUGHING)
Well, he got burned.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.784
I think we both see
that story differently.

-Welcome home, Your Grace.
-Thank you, Shola.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.416
-Afternoon, everyone.
-ALL: Afternoon, Your Grace.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.543
Ready for your maiden flight yet, Shola?

08:21.710 --> 08:23.795
Well, if God wanted man to fly,

08:23.879 --> 08:25.214
he would have given him wings.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.300
Yes, I suppose.
You drive Father's car?

08:28.383 --> 08:29.676

09:05.379 --> 09:06.421
Your Grace.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.424
I should be reprimanding you
for your insolence.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.469
Your opinion behind closed doors
is one thing, Polly,

09:12.636 --> 09:14.847
but I will not tolerate
such demonstrations

09:14.930 --> 09:16.139
in front of my household.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.476
I'll play by your rules
when you play by mine.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.145
Do you really think
you can keep secrets from me?

09:22.688 --> 09:23.730
What do you mean?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.817
Once again, you've turned down
Cousin Felix's invitation

09:26.900 --> 09:28.861
for Conrad to stay
with him in Russia.

09:29.653 --> 09:30.904
And how do you know that?

09:31.488 --> 09:33.490
Us nannies love a good gossip.

09:33.657 --> 09:34.950
And we've all noticed

09:35.033 --> 09:37.452
that you've no problem
with Felix traveling here,

09:37.619 --> 09:40.247
but you seem to have a problem
with Conrad traveling there.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.082
Or anywhere, for that matter.

09:42.749 --> 09:46.336
Yeah. Guilty as charged.
Well, I'm sorry.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.172
I should have
discussed it with you.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.799

flying around in circles

09:52.426 --> 09:53.552
Well, what have I done now?

09:53.719 --> 09:55.304
You haven't even offered me a drink.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.264
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.642
And if we had discussed this,

10:00.726 --> 10:02.853
what would my opinion have been?

10:03.478 --> 10:05.606
You think that my

10:05.772 --> 10:08.567
fear for Conrad's safety
is a weakness.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.527
Fear is natural.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.155
The problem is,
the more you fear something,

10:13.238 --> 10:15.115
the more likely it is to come true.

10:15.991 --> 10:20.037
Hmm. So, then,
we're both in need of a nanny.

I hope so, Father.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.515

out of a shooting suit or

12:03.682 --> 12:06.059
a smoking jacket, you know.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.479
Whatever might help
in the pursuit of fine birds.

let me enjoy it, even if,

12:18.322 --> 12:19.865
you know,
even if you don't want to.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.452
You know,

12:23.619 --> 12:24.828
Conrad,

12:27.247 --> 12:30.417
our ancestors,
they were terrible people.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.671
They robbed, lied, pillaged,
and killed, until one day,

12:34.838 --> 12:37.216
they found themselves noblemen.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.676
But that nobility,

12:40.761 --> 12:42.846
it never came from chivalry.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.558
It came from being tough
and ruthless.

12:47.476 --> 12:51.480
Back then, to be called a "gentleman"

12:51.647 --> 12:53.524
would have been a death sentence.

You must pull out of the war
to save your son's life.

31:58.335 --> 32:00.003
This is nonsense.

32:00.420 --> 32:05.050
You dare to question
the vessel of the Lord?

32:07.594 --> 32:12.182
You dare to risk your son's life?

32:13.433 --> 32:16.645
Nicholas,
come to your senses now!

32:17.187 --> 32:18.689
Please.

32:19.731 --> 32:20.858
Please.

<i>...in these difficult times,</i>

32:39.877 --> 32:41.712

COUSIN FELIX:<i> For a while now,
I've harbored my suspicions</i>

32:52.973 --> 32:55.767
<i>of this so-called priest, Rasputin.</i>

32:56.351 --> 32:58.562
<i>He has the tsar under his spell,</i>

32:58.729 --> 33:01.565
<i>both spiritually
and through opium,</i>

33:03.233 --> 33:06.570
<i>and has persuaded him
to withdraw from the war.</i>

33:08.197 --> 33:10.532
<i>The tsar intends to announce this</i>

33:10.616 --> 33:12.326
<i>in his New Year's speech.</i>

33:12.784 --> 33:14.995
Cousin Felix sends his regards.

33:15.078 --> 33:16.079
Oh.

33:16.330 --> 33:19.291
COUSIN FELIX: <i>I hope your
father's influence can help.</i>

33:20.501 --> 33:23.170
Morton, any ideas?

33:23.670 --> 33:25.964
Well, sir, in my opinion,

33:26.215 --> 33:27.674
this is a very grave situation.

33:27.925 --> 33:29.551
We can trust absolutely no one.

33:29.635 --> 33:31.929
I suggest we assemble
an elite squad of men,

33:32.012 --> 33:34.598
we go to Russia,
and we sort it out ourselves.

33:34.932 --> 33:36.808
Agreed. See to it immediately.

33:36.975 --> 33:41.146
As I'm not allowed to join up,
may I at least go with you?

33:42.814 --> 33:45.567
Conrad, you know your father
made me swear that I would...

33:45.651 --> 33:48.612
Protect my son at all costs.

33:50.489 --> 33:52.658
Where do you want to go, Conrad?

33:54.535 --> 33:55.953
-Russia.
-Why?

33:56.119 --> 33:58.830
To help Cousin Yusupov
deal with Rasputin.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.958
He's going to force Russia
out of the war.

34:01.917 --> 34:03.585
Kitchener, have you killed
so many men

34:03.669 --> 34:04.962
that you're now relying on boys

34:05.045 --> 34:06.129
to run your military intelligence?

34:06.213 --> 34:08.590
-How dare you speak to...
-Shut up, Morton.

34:10.967 --> 34:12.344
Conrad, we're leaving.

34:14.221 --> 34:15.222
Now!

34:26.024 --> 34:27.025
Your lordship?

34:27.568 --> 34:28.652
Let's just hope we don't make

34:28.735 --> 34:30.737
such a mess of things in Russia.

34:40.455 --> 34:42.958
One more dispatch box
for tonight, sir.

34:44.626 --> 34:45.627
Damn it, Morton.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.295
How much do you expect
a man to read?

34:47.462 --> 34:48.589
I'm terribly sorry, my lord.

34:48.672 --> 34:51.257
I would help, but I'm definitely...

34:51.425 --> 34:53.886
definitely more of a soldier
than I am a sailor.

34:54.052 --> 34:56.138
Well, go outside, man,
and get some air.

34:56.972 --> 34:58.140
Quite right.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.734
CONRAD: First Ferdinand,
and now Kitchener.

36:32.818 --> 36:34.736
This was not an accident.

36:35.279 --> 36:36.363
Kitchener was your friend.

Not to mention
this country's last hope.

36:39.157 --> 36:40.576
How can you be so calm?

36:40.742 --> 36:42.286
KITCHENER:<i> My dear Oxford.</i>

36:42.452 --> 36:45.330
<i>I wanted to apologize
for our recent fracas.</i>

<i>In my opinion,
Conrad is a fine young man.</i>

36:48.834 --> 36:50.919
He was betrayed.
We must do something.

KITCHENER:<i> Always ready
to face the world.</i>

36:53.213 --> 36:55.549
No, don't ignore me, Father.
You know it's true.

36:55.966 --> 36:57.801
You cannot keep running away
from problems.

36:57.926 --> 37:00.012
KITCHENER:
<i>But I shall, of course,</i>

37:00.095 --> 37:01.388
<i>respect your wishes</i>

37:01.471 --> 37:04.850
<i>and do everything I can
to keep him out of harm's way.</i>

37:04.933 --> 37:06.602
I don't believe
it was a German mine.

37:06.685 --> 37:08.228
There is something more afoot.

37:10.772 --> 37:12.441
And what if you're successful?

37:13.233 --> 37:14.359
What if you're successful

37:14.443 --> 37:15.986
and keep me locked away
as the world burns?

37:16.153 --> 37:18.322
KITCHENER:<i> If all parents
shared your outlook,</i>

37:18.405 --> 37:20.073

<i>I remain your friend, Kitch.</i>

37:33.545 --> 37:35.714
Your incessant need to protect me

37:35.881 --> 37:38.425
will not redeem your own failure
to protect Mother.

37:44.389 --> 37:46.308
I'm sorry, Father.

37:54.608 --> 37:56.109
(CHAIR SCRAPES)

37:58.820 --> 37:59.821
No, no.

38:02.783 --> 38:04.034
I'm sorry.

38:08.872 --> 38:09.998
Follow me.

38:44.825 --> 38:47.035
Well, about time.

38:47.578 --> 38:49.121
Welcome to the club.

38:49.872 --> 38:51.498
Is he part of the briefing?

38:51.915 --> 38:53.083
Yes.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.295
Take a look.

39:02.134 --> 39:04.803
You see, this war
has made me realize

39:04.970 --> 39:07.222
that we cannot rely on politicians

39:07.306 --> 39:09.266
to do their job properly.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.810
So, I decided

39:12.436 --> 39:14.396
that we should
do something about it.

39:14.563 --> 39:16.523
This isn't making any sense
to me, Father.

39:16.690 --> 39:17.858
OXFORD: Let me explain.

39:18.150 --> 39:22.321
My reputation is of a man
not wanting to be involved,

39:22.404 --> 39:24.740
which means that my character

39:24.823 --> 39:28.243
finds it much easier
to be involved unnoticed.

39:28.660 --> 39:31.538
Just like domestic servants everywhere

39:31.622 --> 39:33.790
who are seen but not heard.

39:33.874 --> 39:36.043
Essentially invisible.

39:36.710 --> 39:39.588
Unless they're part
of the Oxford family, of course.

39:40.088 --> 39:42.966
Shola and Polly have gathered

39:43.133 --> 39:45.260
a network of domestics

39:45.344 --> 39:47.596
such as the world
has never seen.

39:47.930 --> 39:51.892
While British intelligence
listens at keyholes,

39:53.352 --> 39:56.021
our people
are actually in the room.

39:56.313 --> 39:57.564
-Very clever.
-Hmm.

39:57.773 --> 40:00.234
Now, after Ferdinand's assassination,

40:00.442 --> 40:03.737
I visited Gavrilo Princip
in his prison in Sarajevo.

40:15.457 --> 40:16.542
(GASPING)

40:21.129 --> 40:23.549
-(OXFORD GROANS)
-PRINCIP: Thank you.

40:27.928 --> 40:29.304
Why did you kill my friend?

40:29.680 --> 40:32.558
It was the alcohol.
I was overcome.

40:35.394 --> 40:36.979
I'm just a simple Serb.

40:37.145 --> 40:41.775
A very expensive ring
for such a simple Serb.

40:42.192 --> 40:44.278
Ah, and a secret compartment.

40:44.444 --> 40:47.823
That smelled of almonds.
Therefore, cyanide.

40:48.156 --> 40:51.159
Princip's ring proves
he was not acting alone.

40:51.326 --> 40:54.288
There is, as you say, Conrad,
more afoot.

40:54.454 --> 40:55.455
POLLY: Indeed.

40:57.124 --> 41:00.002
Your cousin's letter made us
extend our network to Russia

41:00.169 --> 41:01.461
and it paid off.

41:02.337 --> 41:05.174
The tsar's nanny found a ring
in Rasputin's chambers.

41:06.842 --> 41:08.844
<i>Identical to Princip's,</i>

41:08.927 --> 41:10.846
but with a tortoise
instead of a bear.

41:11.013 --> 41:13.056
Then I think we must
go to Russia immediately

41:13.140 --> 41:15.809
and find a way
to interrogate this monk.

41:15.976 --> 41:18.520
POLLY: But by all accounts,
Rasputin is unbreakable.

41:19.396 --> 41:21.315
As long as he's alive,

41:21.398 --> 41:22.900
the tsar will never change his mind

41:22.983 --> 41:24.985
and with Russia out of the war,

41:25.527 --> 41:27.237
England is doomed.

41:27.779 --> 41:28.864
SHOLA: My lord.

41:34.036 --> 41:37.164
One life to save millions.

41:42.878 --> 41:43.962
OXFORD: So,

41:44.713 --> 41:47.925
the only way to honor the vow
I made to your mother

41:49.635 --> 41:52.763
is to break the vow
I made to myself.

41:54.348 --> 41:56.642
I'm afraid we have no other choice.

41:58.268 --> 42:02.814
It is time for us
to kill Grigori Rasputin.

42:04.358 --> 42:06.193
(TRAIN HORN BLARING)

42:08.278 --> 42:11.114
Rasputin has accepted
an invitation

42:11.198 --> 42:13.158
to your cousin's Christmas ball.

42:13.659 --> 42:15.452
The tsar's nanny informs me

42:15.536 --> 42:18.956
of Rasputin's weakness
for sweet cakes.

42:19.373 --> 42:22.334
And even sweeter boys.

42:23.377 --> 42:26.463
So, after the main course
is served,

42:27.047 --> 42:30.634
Conrad will entice Rasputin

42:31.134 --> 42:33.637
to a private dessert
in the summer room,

42:34.012 --> 42:37.432
where nanny's legendary
Bakewell tart,

42:37.599 --> 42:39.059
laced with poison,

42:39.810 --> 42:41.019
will be waiting for him.

42:41.186 --> 42:43.230
Polly, get baking.

42:44.231 --> 42:46.400
Yes. And don't forget the poison.

42:52.322 --> 42:54.408
OXFORD: Get him to eat
the cake. Understand?

42:54.575 --> 42:55.576
Yes, Father.

42:55.701 --> 42:58.287
Good.

a lot more fun than I am

44:39.596 --> 44:40.722
in these dark days.

44:45.060 --> 44:46.770
I'm looking for someone
who can help me

44:46.854 --> 44:48.897
gain an audience with the tsar.

44:49.356 --> 44:50.983
Perhaps you can be of assistance.

44:51.483 --> 44:53.318
But I am just a humble monk.

44:53.402 --> 44:57.030
Mmm, a humble monk

your father tells me
you like to have fun.

45:20.846 --> 45:24.558
Yes. I believe
I'm sufficiently open-minded.

know any better,

trying to fuck him.

1:05:23.048 --> 1:05:24.508
I've cracked the code.

1:05:25.050 --> 1:05:26.051
It's from Arthur Zimmermann,

1:05:26.134 --> 1:05:27.427
the German Secretary of State in Berlin

1:05:27.594 --> 1:05:29.555
to their ambassador in Mexico City.

1:05:29.847 --> 1:05:32.140
He proposes an alliance with Mexico.

1:05:32.307 --> 1:05:35.143
Germany wants to divert
America's attention,

1:05:35.227 --> 1:05:37.604
so they're asking Mexico
to invade America.

1:05:37.771 --> 1:05:38.897
In print, there.

1:05:39.064 --> 1:05:40.691
So, when President Wilson sees this,

1:05:40.774 --> 1:05:42.317
then he has no choice, but...

1:05:43.068 --> 1:05:44.278
He has to enter the war.

1:05:44.444 --> 1:05:46.238
And the war will be over.

You've hit a six

1:06:10.596 --> 1:06:11.805
Kitchener would be proud.

1:06:13.390 --> 1:06:15.392
Well, I think champagne is in order.

1:06:15.601 --> 1:06:18.478
Uh, thank you, Your Majesty,
but I vowed not to drink

1:06:18.645 --> 1:06:22.733
until Conrad has returned
safely from the war.

1:06:22.900 --> 1:06:24.526
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

1:06:25.068 --> 1:06:27.154
I'll make sure the only action
your boy sees

1:06:27.237 --> 1:06:29.156
is sharpening the general's pencils.

1:06:29.239 --> 1:06:32.618
(LAUGHS) I'm not sure that's cricket.

1:06:36.121 --> 1:06:38.248

1:06:38.332 --> 1:06:39.416

1:06:40.125 --> 1:06:41.835
At least let me save one.

1:06:45.756 --> 1:06:46.757
So,

1:06:47.633 --> 1:06:49.843

AMERICAN GENERAL: King George is waiting
for your response, Mr. President.

1:07:01.355 --> 1:07:03.815
But how can this telegram be real?

1:07:03.982 --> 1:07:05.943
Not even the Germans
would be this stupid.

It's a complicated answer.

He'll explain everything.

of that blast, sir.

1:22:26.196 --> 1:22:28.448
Yeah. But at least
you made it back, son.

1:22:29.032 --> 1:22:31.743
I tell you, if that ain't worth
a Victoria Cross,

1:22:31.827 --> 1:22:32.828
I don't know what is.

1:22:32.995 --> 1:22:34.413

1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:36.790
We need to get this
to high command immediately.

That's right.

1:22:54.850 --> 1:22:55.851
Aye.

1:22:58.145 --> 1:22:59.938
Is that your best Scottish accent?

1:23:00.522 --> 1:23:01.523
You're not Archie Reid.

1:23:04.234 --> 1:23:06.028
And I've been looking for him all night.
So who are you?

1:23:06.111 --> 1:23:10.157
Yes, yes. You're right.
There's a simple explanation.

1:23:10.657 --> 1:23:11.992
-I'm not Archie Reid.
-Fuckin' German spy.

turned out to be
the German ambassador's

1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:47.267

1:28:17.464 --> 1:28:20.592
While your plan for Russia
has been a great success,

1:28:20.801 --> 1:28:24.555
my plan to keep America
out of the war has backfired.

1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:26.390

Such undeniable proof

1:28:31.812 --> 1:28:34.398

I'd say do as you will.

1:36:36.213 --> 1:36:38.924
as long as we have
an honest conversation.

1:36:46.723 --> 1:36:48.058
AMBASSADOR:
What you're lookin' at

1:36:48.141 --> 1:36:50.102
is the lady you strangled.

1:36:50.519 --> 1:36:53.188
She filmed herself
seducing the president

1:36:53.272 --> 1:36:54.982
and is now blackmailing us

1:36:55.065 --> 1:36:57.734
to not even think
about entering the war.

1:36:57.985 --> 1:37:01.613
We cannot risk the integrity
of the U.S. presidency.

1:37:01.697 --> 1:37:03.073
I'm sure.

1:37:03.323 --> 1:37:06.076
Now, if we can get that negative,

1:37:06.159 --> 1:37:08.078
then we will happily join England

1:37:08.161 --> 1:37:10.038
and put Germany out of business.

1:37:10.122 --> 1:37:12.416
Well, I suggest
you interrogate her.

1:37:12.916 --> 1:37:16.753
And I'll follow up on this.

1:37:18.714 --> 1:37:21.758
This is cashmere
from the Kamaliro goat.

1:37:22.843 --> 1:37:23.886
It's very rare.

1:37:24.553 --> 1:37:25.721
Where does it come from?

1:37:26.513 --> 1:37:29.224
Mr. Collins,
cashmere book number one, please.

1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:32.561
Thank you.

1:37:33.896 --> 1:37:36.481
It comes from here.

1:37:36.648 --> 1:37:38.192
The only place in the world

1:37:38.275 --> 1:37:40.277
where the Kamaliro goat breeds.

1:37:40.444 --> 1:37:42.446
OXFORD: Excellent. Shola,

1:37:42.946 --> 1:37:45.449
we're going
into the cashmere business.

1:38:03.175 --> 1:38:06.470
I can see six men guarding the lift.

1:38:07.262 --> 1:38:08.555
Ah...

1:38:08.639 --> 1:38:09.806
If you can call it that.

1:38:09.973 --> 1:38:12.851
Give the word and their numbers
will be reduced.

1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:14.561
Oh, no, Polly.

1:38:14.645 --> 1:38:16.897
The film's negative
is going to be up there.

1:38:17.064 --> 1:38:18.440
And that's our real prize.

1:38:18.607 --> 1:38:19.775
If these guards are alerted,

1:38:19.858 --> 1:38:21.568
then I don't think we'll make it up.

1:38:21.735 --> 1:38:23.862
It's vital that we control this lift.

1:38:29.493 --> 1:38:32.829
This is called a parachute.

1:38:33.288 --> 1:38:36.208
It means that one can jump
out of a plane safely.

1:38:37.709 --> 1:38:38.710
So,

1:38:39.503 --> 1:38:42.005
tomorrow at dawn I'll fly
the plane over the mountain

1:38:42.089 --> 1:38:43.590
and Shola will jump out.

1:38:44.258 --> 1:38:46.218
You land with the parachute,

1:38:46.385 --> 1:38:50.931
take control of the lift,
and then you fire this flare.

1:38:51.348 --> 1:38:52.766
It's a signal to me,

1:38:52.850 --> 1:38:54.726
by which time
I'll have landed the plane,

1:38:54.893 --> 1:38:57.062
made my way over
to the bottom of the lift,

1:38:57.145 --> 1:38:58.689
while Polly provides cover.

1:38:59.523 --> 1:39:02.442
Sir, I could do anything for you,

1:39:02.609 --> 1:39:05.112
but I cannot jump out of an airplane.

1:39:05.487 --> 1:39:07.322
And it's not that I wouldn't try,

1:39:08.615 --> 1:39:10.784
it's that I know I'd let you down.

1:39:11.618 --> 1:39:14.121
Yes. Well, I appreciate
your fear of heights,

1:39:14.288 --> 1:39:17.541
but I am the only one
who can fly. So...

1:39:17.833 --> 1:39:19.626
But you wouldn't
have to land the plane.

1:39:19.793 --> 1:39:22.004
You just have to land yourself.

1:39:23.672 --> 1:39:26.091
Hmm. Well, it, um...

1:39:27.134 --> 1:39:29.720
It would be bad form to ask
a man to do something

1:39:29.803 --> 1:39:32.055
that I wouldn't do myself.

1:39:32.222 --> 1:39:36.059
All right, Shola,
get ready for my signal.

1:39:37.519 --> 1:39:39.021
We go at dawn.

1:44:54.753 --> 1:44:56.588
he is very much mistaken.

1:44:56.755 --> 1:44:59.174
Take this negative to the press,

1:57:30.217 --> 1:57:31.218
Sir.

1:57:31.593 --> 1:57:33.470
Shola, are you all right?

1:57:34.471 --> 1:57:36.598
We've been through worse, Your Grace.

1:57:38.016 --> 1:57:40.769
So, you'd jump
in front of a bullet for me,

1:57:40.853 --> 1:57:42.688
but not out of an airplane?

1:57:44.231 --> 1:57:45.899
So it would seem. (CHUCKLES)

1:57:47.150 --> 1:57:48.527
Thank you, my friend.

1:57:48.694 --> 1:57:50.153
My pleasure.

1:57:51.905 --> 1:57:53.657
-So, Shola.
-Hmm?

1:57:54.074 --> 1:57:56.618
How are we going
to get down from here?

1:58:09.256 --> 1:58:10.674
PRESIDENT WILSON: Come in.

1:58:11.341 --> 1:58:14.678
Mr. President, Chef has made
your favorite peanut butter cookies.

1:58:19.933 --> 1:58:21.310
Thank you.

1:58:37.451 --> 1:58:38.660
Oh...

1:58:39.161 --> 1:58:42.122
Get me the generals, immediately.

1:58:46.418 --> 1:58:48.670
We're goin' to war!

1:58:52.549 --> 1:58:54.551
(ALL CHEERING)

1:59:04.770 --> 1:59:08.357
KING GEORGE:
This victory is all down to you

1:59:08.524 --> 1:59:11.527
and your fine son, Conrad.

1:59:11.902 --> 1:59:14.988
And the courage
of so many others, sir.

1:59:15.155 --> 1:59:16.490
Of course.

1:59:18.116 --> 1:59:20.869
Britain thanks you. And I thank you

1:59:21.203 --> 1:59:23.372
for ensuring that
I didn't meet the same fate

1:59:23.455 --> 1:59:24.706
as my cousins.

1:59:25.749 --> 1:59:28.544
<i>Wilhelm's abdication
was understandable,</i>

1:59:29.753 --> 1:59:31.755
<i>but what happened to Nicholas...</i>

1:59:32.631 --> 1:59:33.715
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

1:59:34.633 --> 1:59:36.093
...was despicable.

1:59:36.260 --> 1:59:37.886
It was, sir.

1:59:38.053 --> 1:59:39.847
I owe you a great personal debt

1:59:39.930 --> 1:59:41.932
that I still have my crown.

1:59:44.518 --> 1:59:46.019
In that case,

1:59:46.103 --> 1:59:49.690
would you meet me tomorrow
at Kingsman, 3:00?

1:59:49.857 --> 1:59:51.942
-A tailor shop?
-Yes, sir.

1:59:52.109 --> 1:59:54.778
Number 11, Savile Row.

1:59:59.992 --> 2:00:03.245
All of us here today are united,

2:00:03.328 --> 2:00:07.040
sadly, in losing
our sons and friends

2:00:07.207 --> 2:00:09.251
in this terrible war.

2:00:09.334 --> 2:00:12.171
What happened to this
generation of young men

2:00:12.254 --> 2:00:14.173
must never happen again.

2:00:14.423 --> 2:00:17.634
I believe the terms
of Versailles are too onerous,

2:00:17.801 --> 2:00:22.139
too extreme, and could
precipitate another war.

2:00:22.306 --> 2:00:25.058
What the world needs
is an organization

2:00:25.142 --> 2:00:26.435
that can channel its resources

2:00:26.518 --> 2:00:30.981
towards preserving peace
and protecting life.

2:00:31.148 --> 2:00:33.984
An independent
intelligence agency

2:00:34.151 --> 2:00:37.154
operating at the highest level
of discretion,

2:00:37.321 --> 2:00:39.573
above the politics and bureaucracy

2:00:39.656 --> 2:00:42.701
of government-run spy organizations.

2:00:43.452 --> 2:00:44.703
To that end,

2:00:45.537 --> 2:00:48.540
I have acquired this shop.

2:00:48.707 --> 2:00:53.629
And I propose that we become
the founding members of

2:00:54.296 --> 2:00:56.965
the Kingsman agency.

2:00:58.634 --> 2:01:00.552
My code name will be...

2:01:02.304 --> 2:01:03.430
Arthur.

2:01:03.972 --> 2:01:05.390
And if you agree to join me,

2:01:05.474 --> 2:01:06.975
you may turn over your place card,

2:01:07.142 --> 2:01:09.603
where you will find
your own code name.

2:01:12.356 --> 2:01:14.399
I am Galahad.

2:01:15.317 --> 2:01:16.610
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

2:01:18.487 --> 2:01:19.947
I am Lancelot.

2:01:21.573 --> 2:01:24.368
I am Bedivere.

2:01:27.663 --> 2:01:29.623
I am Percival.

2:01:29.790 --> 2:01:30.874
Excellent.

2:01:32.167 --> 2:01:35.254
And this is Merlin,

2:01:35.420 --> 2:01:38.382
who will be our quartermaster.

2:01:39.299 --> 2:01:42.678
May our sons and friends
rest in peace.

2:01:43.011 --> 2:01:46.265
And long live the Kingsman.

2:01:47.599 --> 2:01:49.434
ALL: The Kingsman.

2:02:10.914 --> 2:02:12.791
<i>Your body</i>

2:02:12.875 --> 2:02:16.628
<i>Moves like a river
through a house of stone</i>

2:02:17.588 --> 2:02:19.298
<i>So softly</i>

2:02:19.381 --> 2:02:22.926
<i>Like a shadow never comes undone</i>

2:02:24.386 --> 2:02:26.680
<i>You can never know</i>

2:02:26.763 --> 2:02:30.475
<i>Your destiny</i>

2:02:30.559 --> 2:02:33.395
<i>Or what the mirror shows you</i>

2:02:33.478 --> 2:02:37.232
<i>Isn't real</i>

2:02:37.316 --> 2:02:40.402
<i>Only you can</i>

2:02:40.485 --> 2:02:43.363
<i>Truly understand</i>

2:02:43.447 --> 2:02:47.701
<i>The measure of a hero</i>

2:02:47.784 --> 2:02:53.457
<i>Is the measure of a man</i>

2:02:54.625 --> 2:03:01.089
<i>The measure of a man</i>

2:03:02.299 --> 2:03:04.009
<i>Nobody</i>

2:03:04.092 --> 2:03:07.721
<i>Sees the man behind the face you show</i>

2:03:08.722 --> 2:03:10.474
<i>Nobody</i>

2:03:10.557 --> 2:03:14.061
<i>Feels the burden that is yours alone</i>

2:03:15.562 --> 2:03:17.731
<i>You can never know</i>

2:03:17.814 --> 2:03:21.568
<i>Your destiny</i>

2:03:22.027 --> 2:03:24.696
<i>Or what the mirror shows you</i>

2:03:24.780 --> 2:03:28.534
<i>Isn't real</i>

2:03:28.617 --> 2:03:31.745
<i>Only you can</i>

2:03:31.828 --> 2:03:34.873
<i>Truly understand</i>

2:03:34.957 --> 2:03:39.586
<i>The measure of a hero</i>

2:03:39.670 --> 2:03:46.176
<i>Is the measure of a man</i>

2:03:47.719 --> 2:03:50.722
Now it's time to address
the balance of my new flock.

2:03:50.806 --> 2:03:53.350
Thanks to you, Comrade,
our left hand is strong.

2:03:53.517 --> 2:03:54.768
But as you once said,

2:03:54.852 --> 2:03:56.854
our right hand
now needs strengthening.

2:03:56.937 --> 2:03:58.272
(BANGING ON DOOR)

2:03:58.355 --> 2:03:59.648
Come in.

2:04:00.023 --> 2:04:01.441
(DOOR OPENS)

2:04:05.112 --> 2:04:06.363
Don't be shy.

2:04:06.780 --> 2:04:07.948
Come, come.

2:04:12.452 --> 2:04:13.453
My Shepherd.

2:04:14.121 --> 2:04:16.206
This young man will come to rival

2:04:16.290 --> 2:04:18.625
your position in this world, my friend.

2:04:19.710 --> 2:04:21.837
It is an honor, Comrade Lenin.

2:04:23.922 --> 2:04:25.591
And your name?

2:04:27.342 --> 2:04:29.052
Adolf Hitler.
