02:37.040 --> 02:40.600
I’m gonna go to that ATM machine
and get some cash.

02:45.480 --> 02:49.520
Stay here and watch my car. I spent
a lot of money restoring this car.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.760
- You protect my car.
Whining

02:51.840 --> 02:54.640

No savings, checking.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.960
"Smoker, nonsmoker?"
Nonsmoker.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.320
"Democrat, Republican?"
Democrat.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.800

03:59.880 --> 04:02.520

04:08.000 --> 04:09.800
Repeat, were pinned down
and under fire.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.560
Some partner you are.
Why didn’t you warn me, at least?

04:16.360 --> 04:18.600
Guard Is this guy after the money,
or is he just pissed at your car?

04:18.640 --> 04:20.440
Can you reload, please?
Thank you.

04:20.519 --> 04:24.040
Gunfire Continues

04:27.240 --> 04:29.160
My speaker!

04:32.360 --> 04:34.440
My stereo.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.080
Were gonna take this guy out.
You cover us,

04:44.160 --> 04:47.400
and don’t be afraid
to use the gun!

04:52.080 --> 04:54.800
Come on, Jerry Lee!

04:54.840 --> 04:56.600
Hey, come on.
Open up.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.280
Come on.
Shut the door.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.920
Okay, so I forgot.
Its a bulletproof window.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.160
All right, you son of a bitch,
we both have armor now.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
We got him.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.040
No, no, not the running thing.
I hate the running thing.

07:10.440 --> 07:13.880
What, are you leavin
it all for me? Huh?

07:13.920 --> 07:17.400
Christ, what’s with you lately?
What’s with you?

07:17.440 --> 07:20.080
- We almost had that guy.
Whining

07:20.120 --> 07:22.960
Panting
You know why cops have dogs?

07:23.000 --> 07:26.200
So they don’t have to do this!
That’s the deal.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.800
Management, labor.
Foreman, employee.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.880
Boss, secretary.
I walk, you run.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.760
I cuff’em, you catch ´’em.
You get treats, I get a promotion.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.320

I cant breathe!

07:42.520 --> 07:44.440
Gasping

07:47.480 --> 07:50.520
My car! Jerry Lee,
look what he did to my car!

07:50.560 --> 07:52.600
Look what they did!

07:52.640 --> 07:54.840
I couldn’t even sell it
to a cheese factory.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.120
Hey, Dooley!
Check this out.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.280
Its a modified M-16.
A company called...

07:59.360 --> 08:01.240
Armaments 2000s
doin´ the retrofit.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.200
Its supposed to be
for military use only.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.840
- Where did you hear that?
- I saw it in a gun magazine.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.760
- Did you pick that up on the street?
- Yeah.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.080
- Are you supposed to be messin’ with evidence?
- No.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.440
Give me that.
Go get me some coffee.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.200
Well, Jerry Lee, so much
for the Brady Bill, huh?

08:16.280 --> 08:19.520
- Dooley? What are you doing here?
- Hi, Captain.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.960
Sighs
What happened?

08:22.040 --> 08:25.240
Uh, well, there was a,
uh, equipment failure.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.040
- Equipment failure?
- The bad guy had Air Jordan’s on. It was no contest.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.159
What about Jerry Lee?
He needs four little Air Jordan’s too?

08:33.240 --> 08:36.840
- You mean they make those for dogs?
- That was a rhetorical question.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.559
You know, Captain, you should let people
know when you plan to be rhetorical,

08:39.640 --> 08:41.480
cause your tone of voice
never changes.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.600
- You think you’re funny?
- Sometimes.

08:43.679 --> 08:47.520
- This isn’t one of those times.
- Jerry Lee, he just hit me!

08:47.560 --> 08:50.040
- Quit bein’ a smart-ass. Tell
me what happened. - Again!

08:51.400 --> 08:53.680
The bad guy had
a full body armor on.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.360
- That should have given you the advantage.
- It was that lightweight stuff.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.880
What can I tell you?
The guy had a rocket up his ass.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.920
- What the hell is that?
- This here?

09:00.960 --> 09:04.080
Uh, this was the shooters.
This is a modified M-16.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.320
A company named Armaments 2000
does the retrofit.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.240
Its apparently
for military use only.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.920
- How do you know all that?
- I’m trying to better myself by taking night seminars.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.200
Ah, shut up, will you?
You better sit down. You look pale.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.040
- Probably because you hit me.
- And give that dog there a drink of water.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.200
Jerry Lee is fine,
and so am I.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.080
You don’t look fine.
Sit down before you fall down.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.840
- Now. Detective Harris?
- Yes.

09:27.920 --> 09:32.320
- Its the smog!
- Take this to the lab and check it for prints, okay?

09:32.360 --> 09:35.120
You know, Dooley,

09:35.200 --> 09:37.880
every time you go someplace lately,
people try to kill you.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.240
- Well, I’m a popular guy.
- Look, I’m serious here.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.360
- You’ve lost three suspects
in three weeks! - Come-

09:43.400 --> 09:45.720
- You are either out of your league...
- I am not out of my league.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.800
- or you’ve lost a step.
- What are you talking about, "lost a step"?

09:48.840 --> 09:51.880
You should have taken
time off after Tracy died.

09:51.960 --> 09:56.520
- That has nothing to do with it, Captain.
- Oh. Are you sure?

09:56.600 --> 09:59.680
Absolutely sure.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.440
When was the last time
you had a physical?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.960
Physical. Is that the blood pressure,
when they do the-

10:07.040 --> 10:09.120
Laughs, Whimpers

10:09.160 --> 10:12.640
I want you both checked out.
You understand me?

10:12.680 --> 10:16.040
I obviously cant
count on you anymore.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.800
Hey!
What about my car?

10:21.880 --> 10:25.240
Have your detailer look at it.
He can probably rub it out.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.080
Rub it out?

10:28.160 --> 10:30.360
I guess I can drive it at night.
Nobody’ll see it.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.440
Come on, Jerry Lee.
Come on, get in.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.360
My poor car.
Sighs

10:36.400 --> 10:38.920
- Aw, he got my cup holder too.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.600

11:09.640 --> 11:11.960
Dooley
Ah, you know what? Its my fault.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.960
Woman Devon Lane, this is
my husband, Detective Dooley.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.040
Dooley Nice to meet you. Devon
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.440
Devon I’m so excited
- Dooley Can we get some drinks over here?

11:18.520 --> 11:21.160
- "De
-vawn," you want a beer? Devon Its Devon.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.600
Dooley Devon. Sorry. What’s
with the tape recorder?

11:24.680 --> 11:26.720
Devon I’m a writer. I tape
everything. Tracy Devon,

11:26.760 --> 11:29.320
I just want to say that I see
real potential in your work.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.880
Devon Potential? Really? Tracy Oh, yeah.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.680
He’s been a cop a long time. Maybe he
can help you with some of that cop stuff.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.400
Devon Would you? Dooley Well,
yeah, sure. You okay, honey?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.600
Tracy Ill be fine. I’ll be
back in a few minutes. Excuse me.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.520
Devon
Tracy told me you read my manuscript.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.040
Dooley Yeah, I did. I
didn’t read the whole thing.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.960
I read the first
and the last chapter.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.880
That’s really
all I had time for.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.040
Devon The first and last
chapters? Dooley I gotta tell ya,

11:51.120 --> 11:53.920
uh, its-
it wasn’t really that real.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.720
Devon It wasn’t real? Dooley No, it wasn’t
real. I didn’t believe a lot of the-

11:57.800 --> 12:01.360
all that cop stuff you have in there-
the shootouts and the bank robbery.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.560
That’s not really
how it happens.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.320
Devon It wasn’t real? Dooley That’s all
right. It’s your first attempt, man.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.880
Don’t worry about it.
You’ll get there.

12:07.915 --> 12:09.360
Don’t worry about it.
You’ll get there.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.440
Woman Any loss of appetite?
- No, I’m eatin´ pretty well.

12:12.520 --> 12:16.000
- Not you, the dog.
- Oh, uh-

12:16.080 --> 12:18.040
No, he’s fine.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.840
- Okay, I’m gonna increase the speed and incline.
- Why?

12:22.920 --> 12:25.680
Thuds
- Well, that’s the standard test for canines, Detective.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.800
Oh.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.320
Jerry Lee Whining
- What?

12:30.360 --> 12:32.600
I can hold the handrail.
Humans can hold the handrail.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.840
All right,
all right, all right.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.880
Have you noticed
any changes in him?

12:44.920 --> 12:48.400
Yeah, he doesn’t chase the little chuck
wagon across the kitchen floor anymore.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.000
Any loss of hearing
or smell?

12:51.080 --> 12:52.720
Well, that depends on
what you mean by "any. "

12:52.755 --> 12:54.360
Well, that depends on
what you mean by "any. "

12:54.440 --> 12:56.640
Well, maybe sometimes,
a little bit.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.160
- Well, there’s nothing wrong with your dog.
- Really?

12:59.240 --> 13:01.360
He’s just suffering
from the effects of aging.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.880
- You should slow him down a bit.
- Why?

13:03.920 --> 13:06.320
Would you send your grandfather out
to try and do your job?

13:06.400 --> 13:09.680
I wouldn’t send my grandfather
to microwave popcorn.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.840
- So why would you send out Jerry Lee?
- Cause my grandfather’s too old.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.080
- So is Jerry Lee.
- What do you mean? Look at him. He looks great.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.600
Do you know that dogs are leading
longer and healthier lives these days?

13:19.680 --> 13:22.640
- Where did you hear that?
- Seminar. At night. I try to better myself.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.360
Oh, you’re trying to better yourself?
Maybe you should get a checkup.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.800
You’ve got high blood pressure.
Your face is bright red.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.760
That is a drinking problem!

13:30.800 --> 13:32.880
Well, what do you know?
You’re a vet.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.320
You both need to be
on special diets.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.200
- The same one? - No. You should
be on a low-fat, low-sodium diet.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.560
The dog needs to be on
a senior maintenance meal plan.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.200
Whining
- What the hells that?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.360
Lamb and rice
for older dogs.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.840
It might give him some flatulence for a
week or so, but nothing to worry about.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.840
Sighs Nothing for you to worry
about. I gotta live with the damn dog.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.080
- You trying to be funny?
- No.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.040
I forgot my wallet,
so can I write a check?

14:02.080 --> 14:04.240
Do I get
any free samples?

14:05.480 --> 14:09.440
Jerry Lee Whining
- Senior maintenance.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.840
Hey, your day.
You checked out great.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.440
You just, uh-

14:15.480 --> 14:17.360
- You’re out of shape.
Whines

14:36.040 --> 14:39.080
Come on. Lets go.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.640
Come on.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.160

Jerry Lee Whining

16:13.160 --> 16:14.760
Jump, jump, jump!

16:25.520 --> 16:28.000
Hey!
What are you doing on my spot?

16:28.040 --> 16:31.080
Whining

16:31.160 --> 16:33.640
That’s my spot.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.720
Here.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.840
Whines

16:37.920 --> 16:40.960
That’ll make
you feel better.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.080
You all right?

16:43.160 --> 16:45.520
What’s the matter
with your lamb and rice?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.520
You don’t like it?
Here.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.760
Huh? Here.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.880
How’s that?
Nothin´,, huh?

16:55.960 --> 16:57.960
Telephone Ringing
- But this is good for us.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.880
Think we should
work out every day.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.085
- Very tribal.
Ringing Continues

17:01.120 --> 17:02.440
- Very tribal.
Ringing Continues

17:02.520 --> 17:06.760
Yeah, some insurance company you are. I
called the office three hours ago about my car-

17:06.839 --> 17:09.240
Hey! Jeez!

17:09.319 --> 17:13.680
Jerry Lee! Come here.
Lie down. Down.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.440
Man
I just saved you 300 calories.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.720
- Who is this?
- You should be drinking light beer.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.760
Less filling,
and it wont slow you down.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.800
And Dooley, you better pay attention
to the "wont slow you down" part.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.240
I could have beat you
running backwards, old man.

17:31.320 --> 17:35.480
- What do you want?
- Don’t tell me you haven’t figured it out yet, Detective.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.240
Three times
in three weeks, Dooley.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.040
I could have taken you out
anytime I wanted.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.160
I want you to know how it feels to have
someone else control your destiny.

17:45.200 --> 17:49.280
- Jerry, down!
- How it feels to have someone else destroy your life.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.880
- What do you want?
- Its hard to lose a loved one.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.800
Isn’t it, Dooley? But then,
sometimes life just has a way...

17:54.920 --> 17:57.520
of kicking you in the face,
just when you think you’ve got it made.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.440
Hey, why don’t you
come in.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.320
You and I, we can have
a beer, we can chat.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.240
And then
Ill bust your ass.

18:04.320 --> 18:08.520
You’re in no position, literally,
to start playin´ bad guy, Dooley.

18:08.600 --> 18:12.520
Growling, Barking
Motorcycle Engine Revving

19:14.440 --> 19:17.160
Dooley ... about my car. Hey! Jeez!

19:17.200 --> 19:22.720
- Jerry Lee! Come here. - "Chapter
Six. Spoon-fed information by our hero,

19:22.800 --> 19:27.360
Detective Dooley finally
figures out he is the target.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.880
But he still
has no idea why.

19:29.960 --> 19:34.440
Dooley’s Voice Who is this?
- Life is about to get a little more real. "

19:38.760 --> 19:42.480
Man On Tape I could have beat
you running backwards, old man.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.120
Don’t tell me you haven’t
figured it out yet, Detective.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.760
Three times
in three weeks, Dooley.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.640
I could have taken you out
anytime I wanted.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.560
Dooley Well, at least we
know now were being set up.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.480
Now, if we could just keep
Byers off our back.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.880
- You let me do the talkin, huh?
Jerry Lee Growls

20:04.120 --> 20:06.480
Oh, am I sore.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.920
Groans
Okay.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.480
Dooley How are you
feelin’? Come here. Barking

20:17.520 --> 20:20.480
Come on. Stay with me.
You know what, Jerry Lee?

20:20.560 --> 20:22.480
That vet was wrong.
Were not getting old.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.120
Were getting sexier
and better and wiser.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.400
Barks

20:30.920 --> 20:33.360
Chattering

20:36.720 --> 20:38.640
Man
Everybody duck. Its Dooley.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.800
Don’t listen to him.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.400
Whining
- Lay down, Jerry Lee.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.600
Whines
- What’s with him?

20:47.680 --> 20:51.920
What?
He’s not a morning dog.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Listen, last night the shooter called.
Took a shot at me.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.960
- Hit my beer.
- Why didn’t you call it in?

20:56.080 --> 20:59.320
I got another beer. But wait a minute,
he said something weird.

20:59.400 --> 21:04.480
Something really strange. He said, "Its
hard to lose a loved one, isn’t it?"

21:04.560 --> 21:08.560
- Is he talkin about Tracy?
- I don’t know.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.760
Could be anything. Could be a revenge
act, it could be somebody I know.

21:11.800 --> 21:15.360
- I-I-I don’t know.
- Harry Stipe. Harry Stipe.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.800
He swore that he would get you
after what happened to his brother!

21:17.880 --> 21:20.920
- No, Harry Stipes doin´ five to ten.
- Not anymore. He got paroled.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.840
- Harry Stipe is out?
- Yeah, it just came in.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.880
- Stipe is out, and nobody told me?
- Just came across my desk.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.600
- Give me the parole officers name. I want his address.
- Not so fast, Dooley.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.000
- Come on! Give it to me.
- Sit.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.080
Whines

21:33.120 --> 21:37.840
There’s some guy out there gunnin´ for you.
You’re not going anywhere alone anymore.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.960
- Not this again.
- Welles, get in here.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.440
- Welles?
- And bring Zeus with you!

21:44.520 --> 21:47.120
- Zeus?
Snarling

21:47.160 --> 21:51.000
Growling
- Hey, whoa-ho-ho!

21:55.200 --> 21:57.080
Meet your new partners.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.160
No way!

22:00.280 --> 22:02.720
- You’re not gonna actually let them in here, are you?
- I certainly am.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.520
- Detective Dooley.
- Officer Welles.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.080
- Sergeant Welles now.
- Oh. Sorry, I didn’t know.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.680
- Good, you two know each other.
- Yeah, we had a moment a little while ago.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.680
- Before he, uh
- Coughs Mumbling

22:18.720 --> 22:21.440
Look, I don’t see what that dog
has gotta do that Jerry Lee can’t do.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.080
Zeus!
Speaking Dutch

22:28.320 --> 22:31.000
Speaking Dutch

22:31.040 --> 22:33.240
Very impressive, Welles.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.120
- Dooley?
- What?

22:36.160 --> 22:39.320
He was trained
in anti-terrorist tactics.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.000
Could he go into a mini-mart
and pick up a six-pack of beer?

22:42.040 --> 22:44.400
He attacks through windows.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.720
Well, Jerry Lee
has mastered Windows 98.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.880
Got his own chat room.
"Dogs for Dogs"?

22:53.280 --> 22:55.360
Shouting In Dutch

23:00.080 --> 23:02.440
Jerry Lee
can do that.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.800
- You can do that, cant you?
Whining

23:07.360 --> 23:09.440
Captain? I really don’t
think this is a good idea.

23:09.480 --> 23:12.320
- I couldn’t agree more with her.
- Dooley shouldn’t even have that dog.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.200
He’s not trained as a canine officer.
He’s a dog with a pet.

23:15.280 --> 23:18.320
Growls
- Ooh! Aren’t we a little moody?

23:18.400 --> 23:21.800
Growls
- Zeus and I can handle this case alone.

23:21.880 --> 23:25.280
I got news for you. Once I get a
parolees address, this case is closed.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.320
Then I got news for you.
A parolee doesn’t even fit the profile.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.480
Profile? What is this,
an Olympic moment?

23:30.560 --> 23:33.960
- This is a police investigation here.
- Really? I wouldn’t have guessed.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.240
You don’t need a profile
to catch a bad guy.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.680
All you need is a good cop
with good instincts.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.880
I’m glad you said "good cop,"
because so far, your instincts suck!

23:41.920 --> 23:45.720
You two are gonna
get along great.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.960
Dooley, I need to talk to you alone.
No offense, Sergeant.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.160
No offense
taken, Captain.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.360
See you outside,
partner.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.680
Hey! If you’re
gonna ride with me,

23:55.720 --> 23:58.480
get out of that uniform and
be on my desk in five minutes.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.840
- "At. " He meant "at. "
- No, I meant "at. "

24:01.920 --> 24:04.240
"At. "
At my desk.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.400
- "At. "
Muttering In Dutch

24:08.480 --> 24:11.440
What is wrong with you? Didn’t you go
to the sexual harassment seminar?

24:11.520 --> 24:14.120
I missed that one.
I was- I was at another seminar.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.160
All right, forget about it.
Shell probably be cool about it.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.960
- Ah, look. Put Jerry Lee outside.
- H-He cant testify.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.640
- Look, just have him wait outside.
- He can keep a secret!

24:22.720 --> 24:24.720
- Have him wait outside!
- All right. Come on, Jerry.

24:24.800 --> 24:29.120
Uh, I got a delivery
for, uh, Detective Dooley.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.720
Sign, please.

24:33.760 --> 24:37.160
- Uh, there’s a complementary card in there.
- Thank you.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.680
I saw the vet report
today, and uh,

24:42.720 --> 24:45.000
Sighs
- you need to-

24:46.760 --> 24:49.360
Dooley What? Jerry Lee Whines

24:51.160 --> 24:53.400
You better give
some serious th-

24:57.520 --> 25:00.720
- You need to give thought to getting a newer dog.
- What?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.640
- Well, one like Zeus. Yes.
- Zeus?

25:02.720 --> 25:04.680
That crazy, psycho dog?
Are you kiddin’ me?

25:04.720 --> 25:07.360
He wouldn’t last five minutes
with me- I’d kill him!

25:07.400 --> 25:09.360
Look, he probably
doesn’t even drink.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.480
I don’t need a new dog. You know what
I need is a bigger gun- one like this.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.080
- Will you put that away, you idiot?
- Or one like this.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.800
- Where did you get this? This-This is
L.A., not Dallas. - How about this one?

25:19.880 --> 25:23.640
Look, I got a guy out there
with an M-16 takin’ shots at me,

25:23.720 --> 25:26.240
and all I got...
is this.

25:26.280 --> 25:29.840
Dooley, firearms, that’s not
the problem. The problem is Jerry Lee.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.480
- What?
- Well, if he misses a step, you could lose your life.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.800
Don’t you understand? That’s why
I’m giving you both new partners.

25:34.880 --> 25:37.080
I read that vet report.

25:37.160 --> 25:41.480
The vet report said you were in the best
shape you’ve ever been in your life.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.560
Alert. Responsive.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.480
He’s a killer!

25:45.520 --> 25:47.880
You’re a stud dog,
Jerry Lee.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.360
Whines
- See?

25:52.400 --> 25:55.000
You see that?
You see his sly and uncanny way?

25:55.080 --> 25:58.560
He’s pretending to be
asleep so he can pounce.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.560
Good boy, Jerry Lee.
Come on. Lets go.

26:01.640 --> 26:04.360
Come! Jerry.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.560
Hot dogs!
Hamburgers! Chili!

26:07.640 --> 26:09.800
Whining

26:11.520 --> 26:15.320
Hey, Dooley. These flowers
were just delivered for you.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.320
Must have been
a wild night.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.880
"Was last night as good for you
as it was for me?"

26:21.800 --> 26:24.920
- Who gave you these?
- The delivery guy.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.640
- What did he look like?
- Green pants, black belt.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.800
You saw him from
the waist down, that’s it?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.720
- I was sittin’ in- - What are you
doing? Touching evidence again?

26:31.800 --> 26:34.120
Puttin’ your prints
all over this? Listen to me.

26:34.200 --> 26:38.320
- You see these gloves? I want you to wear these things. Forever!
- Yeah.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.480
- Okay.
- Take these down to the lab and have them dusted.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.760
Welles Zeus! Come!
- Come on. Lets go.

26:52.080 --> 26:56.080
That Welles and that stupid psycho dog
is probably sittin up at the desk.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.000
You and I can go get
the bad guys ourselves.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.040
Hey!
We were just looking for you.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.960
- Weren’t we, Jerry?
- Check this out.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.360
If you look at the holes,
they actually spell out something.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.640
It says, "Even though
I’m older and slower,

27:06.680 --> 27:09.040
I’m still the same asshole
as I was before. "

27:09.080 --> 27:11.600
Very funny. That’s very funny.
You think that was funny?

27:11.680 --> 27:14.000
Sighs Come on, Jerry Lee.
- Zeus!

27:14.040 --> 27:15.920
Dutch

27:17.400 --> 27:19.280
I can do that.

27:21.680 --> 27:24.120
All right, look.
I want to get one thing straight...

27:24.200 --> 27:26.040
before we go on here,
all right?

27:26.120 --> 27:29.520
What went on between
you and me is history.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.560
Now, you have got
to let it go.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.840
I don’t even think
about it anymore.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.840
And neither should you.
Okay?

27:38.080 --> 27:41.080
- Okay.
- What do you mean, okay?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.840
- I mean okay.
- Okay, you agree with it,

27:42.920 --> 27:45.160
or okay, you don’t
think about it anymore?

27:45.200 --> 27:47.320
- Okay. I don’t think about it.
- How can you not think about it?

27:47.400 --> 27:49.520
- You said you don’t think about it.
- Well, of course not.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.760
- I mean, Im-I´mm-I´mm-
- But what? What?

27:51.800 --> 27:55.600
What? You’re so irresistible,
how could I not think about it?

27:55.680 --> 27:59.400
- Well-
- Because, you know, it was one night.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.120
- Heat of the moment stuff.
- Absolutely right!

28:02.160 --> 28:04.560
- Right.
- Get in.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.840
Sighing, Swearing
In Dutch

28:06.920 --> 28:09.800
- What was that?
- What? Nothing.

28:12.280 --> 28:16.240
And you, dog, lets get one thing
straight between you and me, all right?

28:16.320 --> 28:20.520
Number one: No barking,
no drooling, no f-

28:21.560 --> 28:23.120
passing of gas...

28:23.160 --> 28:26.600
or performing any bodily functions
in or about my car.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.560
Number two: You always
sit in the back seat.

28:29.640 --> 28:34.320
Number three:
Never give me any lip.

28:34.400 --> 28:38.040
Growling
- That’s negotiable. That’s negotiable.

28:38.120 --> 28:42.560
Just relax.
Jerry Lee, watch him.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.560
Slams Door

28:45.600 --> 28:50.160
Ticket!
Look at that!

28:50.200 --> 28:52.200
I think she follows
me around.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.520
Just put it in
the glove compartment.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.080
Dooley! How many
parking tickets do you have?

28:57.160 --> 28:59.600
- Put’em in the glove compartment and shut it.
- Do you know how to park a car?

28:59.640 --> 29:01.520

Camera Shutter Clicks

29:08.440 --> 29:12.440
Ugh, I’m gonna need a tetanus shot

29:12.520 --> 29:14.360
Engine Starts Dooley Were
going to Harry Stripe’s.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.240
Were going to arrest him, and you’ll
never have to see me again, all right?

29:17.320 --> 29:20.120
Fine.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.080
Dooley Your dog likes to look through windows?
- He attacks through windows.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.000
Dooley Yeah, but can
he sing? Welles What?

29:25.080 --> 29:27.720

Dooley
Jerry Lee Howling

29:30.680 --> 29:33.800

Howling Continues

29:43.920 --> 29:46.000
Welles I’m tellin´ ya, he’s
not the guy we’re lookin´ for.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.000
- And how would you know that?
- Because he doesn’t fit the profile.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.720
Profile. Clears Throat Welles,

29:51.800 --> 29:53.880
this is a profile.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.600
A profile is only good when
you’re trying to narrow down suspects.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.960
We need a list
of suspects first.

30:00.040 --> 30:03.400
- Its not him.
- Okay, then. Stay in the car.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.280

Jerry Lee? Lets go. Growling

30:09.360 --> 30:12.120
We are not staying

30:17.760 --> 30:20.560
Not you.
Him.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.760
I got a weapon.
Ill use it.

30:22.840 --> 30:26.320
We are trained K-9 officers.
We don’t do "stay in the car. "

30:26.400 --> 30:28.240
Why don’t you...

30:28.320 --> 30:32.240
and your little puppy
go in through the back?

30:32.320 --> 30:36.080
He’s not a puppy. And why do we have

30:36.160 --> 30:39.600

converting this to condos?

30:57.120 --> 30:58.960
If we take some out
of your money market fund,

30:59.040 --> 31:01.680
we can buy one of these
and use it as a rental.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.880
I hear conversions
can be a great investment.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.720

Hey, listen, man. You just keep

32:08.320 --> 32:10.280
I don’t want to deal
with Jerry Lee again, man.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.160
You know, last time we met,
it wasn’t a good thing.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.280
Jesus, Harry.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.080

33:16.680 --> 33:18.640
They’re out there

Fat Tommy got’em for me.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.640
- I thought you couldn’t leave the place.
- He delivers.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.920
So, if he didn’t make it
in 30 minutes, you get free ammo?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.120
Hey, you know,

34:12.719 --> 34:17.159
Great instincts, Dooley.
So, what now, big guy?

34:17.199 --> 34:20.719
Dooley You know, after battle,
dogs and men like a treat.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.719
Jerry Lee was good,
so he gets a treat!

34:25.600 --> 34:27.520
Where’s he goin´?

34:27.600 --> 34:29.639
Uh, he knows
its treat time.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.400
- I cant believe you’re going
to feed your dog this.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.320
Surest way to kill him
is with this garbage.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.239
He should be eating nothing
but senior maintenance.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.719
You know what? I tried that senior
maintenance. I liked it. I mean, with a beer.

34:53.480 --> 34:57.280
Whimpering

34:57.360 --> 34:59.800

Dutch.
He was trained in the Netherlands.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.560
Oh, the Netherlands!
Scuse me!

36:04.640 --> 36:06.480
Jerry Lee
was trained in Oxnard.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.680
You know, the best K-9 dogs
come from Oxnard.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.080
I could learn so much
from you, Dooley.

36:13.120 --> 36:16.080
God, I hate it when people
don’t pick up after their dogs!

36:16.120 --> 36:18.000
Breed their dogs
in the park.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.840

37:46.240 --> 37:49.160
Banging your doors?
Your doors are all shot up.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.320

- Nope.
- Come on, you must have seen him walkin down the street.

38:38.840 --> 38:41.360
- With a light on him, he looked like a fire truck?
- Never.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.920
Jerry Lee, you hear that?
He never heard of Fat Tommy.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.840

39:41.480 --> 39:43.720
Well, smarty-pants,

Hey, Fat Tommy, what are you
worried about? He’s a good doggie.

42:02.400 --> 42:05.560
Ooh!

42:05.640 --> 42:07.480
Good thing your boys
got a cup on, huh?

42:07.560 --> 42:11.280
- Otherwise, he’d be known as
Little Jackie Hammer. Whimpering

42:11.360 --> 42:13.400
I bet you got a lot
of money on this guy, huh?

42:13.480 --> 42:17.120
What kind of a psycho would teach
a dog to do something like that?

42:17.200 --> 42:19.840
Actually, he taught himself.

Yeah, its

Fat Tommy I told you guys never

43:05.640 --> 43:07.760
- What was all that Kung Fu crap about?
- It wasn’t Kung Fu.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.440
It was Krav Maga.
God, Dooley, get out of the 70s.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.480
Zeus and I trained for two months

43:14.560 --> 43:17.640

Ah, "Kibbutz n´ Bits. "
Did you like that?

43:20.240 --> 43:23.520
Come on, now, I know you thought that
was funny. You’re laughing inside.

43:23.600 --> 43:27.480

It’s not good for your health.

- Yes.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.920

45:01.720 --> 45:05.080

45:53.600 --> 45:56.320

45:56.400 --> 45:59.320
Well, from this point of view,
they’re quite impressive.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.440
You know, Phil,
this is your third strike.

46:01.480 --> 46:04.800
- They’re gonna throw away the key.
- Why do you think I’m shootin´?

46:04.880 --> 46:07.360
- Its nothin´ personal.
- That’s nice to hear.

46:07.440 --> 46:10.720

47:42.920 --> 47:45.520
Chuckles
Little too pricey for you, Dooley.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.720
- You got any names?
- I didn’t ask it!

47:47.760 --> 47:51.680
- You know what he looked like?
- I wasn’t looking at his face, I was looking at the money.

47:51.720 --> 47:54.600
I’m sure he looked like your average,
creepy kind of gun nut.

47:54.640 --> 47:58.120
- A lot like you!
- Well, Phil, you’re gonna need that sense of humor...

47:58.160 --> 48:00.040

He only drinks water every couple days.

50:57.040 --> 50:58.920
Just like a camel.

50:58.960 --> 51:02.040
- Probably on his fathers side.
- That’s an interesting trait.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.040
Its very efficient too.
He pees all at once.

51:06.040 --> 51:07.880
Is your dog on steroids
or something?

51:07.960 --> 51:11.000
- No. Why?
- I’ve never seen a dog like that not pant.

51:11.080 --> 51:13.400
He’s not tired.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.800
- How old is Jerry Lee?
- Oh, I don’t know.

51:15.880 --> 51:18.200
Well, how long have
you two been together?

51:18.240 --> 51:20.520
Its the longest relationship
I’ve ever had.

51:20.600 --> 51:22.440
You’ve got everything
tied up here,

51:22.520 --> 51:24.360
so we’ve got a couple of
personal things to take care of.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.280

of transportation, Jerry Lee.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.720
No gasoline, no insurance.

51:59.800 --> 52:02.160
No parking tickets.

52:02.240 --> 52:05.200

- Well go look for him. Zeus will seek him out.
- No, no, no, no.

56:16.440 --> 56:20.640
He has to come to me. That’s the prodigal
son. He’s gotta go and come back.

56:20.680 --> 56:25.600
I would be doing him damage if I went
and chased him down the street.

56:49.480 --> 56:52.160
Well, maybe Byers is right.

56:52.240 --> 56:55.000
- Maybe Jerry Lee just cant cut it anymore.
- Byers said that?

56:55.080 --> 56:57.640
- Yeah, more than once.
- So, that’s why he assigned us to you.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.560
Yep.

57:00.560 --> 57:03.240
Where is he going?

57:04.560 --> 57:08.320
Barking Dooley There he is!

57:08.400 --> 57:11.600
Welles
In front of the storage building.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.520
Jerry Lee!

57:13.560 --> 57:15.560
Jerry Lee,
what are you doing?

57:17.080 --> 57:19.400
I’m sorry, Jerry Lee.
Did I hurt your feelings?

57:19.440 --> 57:23.760
- What’s with you?
- He’s not running away, Dooley. He wants you to follow him.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.960
Jerry Lee Barking

57:26.000 --> 57:27.880
Zeus, come!

57:37.880 --> 57:40.440
- I think he’s on to something.
- I hate stairs.

57:41.960 --> 57:43.800
Jerry Lee?

57:48.400 --> 57:51.280
What do you got?
He’s keying in on something.

58:00.080 --> 58:02.440
Whimpering
- Okay.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.480
Okay, Jerry Lee,
back off.

58:04.560 --> 58:06.920
- Move out of the way.
- What are you doing?

58:06.960 --> 58:10.600
I’m picking the lock.
We do it all the time.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.520
That’s what worries me.

58:12.560 --> 58:14.520
Sighs You have a better idea?
- Yes.

58:14.640 --> 58:18.400
One of us will stake out the room from across
the hall, the other will go get a warrant.

58:18.480 --> 58:20.840
Jerry Lee and I
do not do warrants.

58:20.880 --> 58:22.760
Or back doors.
What else don’t you do?

58:22.800 --> 58:26.280
We don’t do flavored coffee. We don’t
do aroma therapy. We don’t do raw fish.

58:26.320 --> 58:28.240
- Normally known as sushi.
- Yes, we don’t do that.

58:28.280 --> 58:30.880
We don’t do tofu. We don’t do collagen.
We don’t do colonics.

58:30.960 --> 58:34.720
We don’t do e-mail. We don’t do head
shrinkers, group therapy, social workers.

58:34.800 --> 58:37.720
We don’t do cute little doggy outfits.
We don’t do shopping.

58:37.840 --> 58:41.560
- We don’t do Near Beer or little speedos.
- Thank God.

58:41.600 --> 58:45.400
- And we don’t do sporks.
- I get the point. I’ll get the warrant.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.120
- Don’t touch the lock.
Jerry Lee Whines

58:48.200 --> 58:52.280
And we don’t do, "Ooh, is that a pimple
on your back? Can I squeeze it?"

58:57.280 --> 58:59.160
Zeus Barks

59:02.840 --> 59:06.920

can’t touch that lock. Gunshot

59:07.000 --> 59:09.800
Jerry Lee Howling

59:09.880 --> 59:12.120

Howling Continues

59:12.200 --> 59:15.520
You’re a good singer.

59:18.240 --> 59:20.560
Howling Intensifies
- Okay, were done singing now. All right? You happy?

59:20.600 --> 59:23.200
Stop it! Stop! Come on.
The bad guys gonna hear us.

59:23.280 --> 59:25.920
Yeah, see? Look. I could stuff you
and put you on the wall.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.840
See?
Like a moose head.

59:38.840 --> 59:40.960
You know, you’re
the best dog I ever had.

59:43.320 --> 59:47.000
You’re the only dog I ever had,
but you’re still the number one guy.

59:50.200 --> 59:52.280
You know, this is hard
for me to say, but-

59:54.200 --> 59:56.680
Whimpers
Sniffing

59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.520
- Get away from me. Is that
you? Was that you? Whimpers

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.760
Oh, my God! That is rancid!
Groaning

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.520
Banging On Door

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.320
Gagging

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.720
- What did you eat?
Banging Continues

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.960
Did you just cut another one?
Did you?

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.160
Gagging Continues
There’s something alien in you!

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.880
Whew! Whew!
Whew! Whew!

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.680
You’re off that
lamb and rice diet!

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.040
Oh, God!
Coughing

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.080
Dooley!

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.720
- Oh!
Whimpering

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.360
Oh!
Oh!

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.880
What is that smell?

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.920
- What? What smell?
- Oh, don’t tell me you don’t have a sense of smell.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.760
- My God! My eyes are watering.
- It was Jerry Lee!

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.680
- Stop blaming the dog.
- Honest to God, it was Jerry Lee.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.080
- That is so sad, man. You need to go to a doctor.
- No!

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.160
- I swear! It was Jerry Lee!
Whimpers Softly

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.120
All right, I got the warrant.
Shoot off the lock.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.560
I advise you to wait, however,
considering the gas in this room.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.480
- You’re gonna blow us up.
Gunshot

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.400
Seek.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.160
Oh, yeah,
he’s a gun nut, all right.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.040
Welles
Looks like he’s some kind of writer.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.080
Everything’s written
under a different name.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.440
He’s got pictures of his girlfriend
or his wife hanging up.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.320
What?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.080
Its not his wife.
It’s mine.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.920
Jerry Lee Whimpering

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.200
Welles They’re picking
up the manuscripts later.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.640
So, what do you think? I mean, they’re
all cop stories. Every one of ´’em.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.360
Tracy was an editor.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.560
That rejection letter
she wrote was really nice.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.840
Tracy was nice in every way.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.920
That’s why you disappeared
that night that we, um-

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.160
Kissed?

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.080
Yes.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.680
I’m sorry about that.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.840
No, don’t be sorry. It was nothing to
apologize for. You just weren’t ready.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.760
Maybe.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.480
Dooley, you really gotta stop
blaming yourself for what happened.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.720
No, I’m serious.
Listen, people die.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.400
That is a fact of life.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.360
You’re a really good cop.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.360
And so is Jerry Lee.
You got really great instincts.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.760
You know?
And they cant teach you that.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.720
Trust me, I know.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.120

- You’re welcome.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.600

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.360
- Is he gonna bite me?
- Probably.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.360
You know, that dog
is very co-dependent.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.040
- Can I take him in the other room?
- You can try.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.760
- Zeus? Ham, cheese?
Chuckles

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.200
- Look what I got. Look what I got.
Growling

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.560
Come on. Lets go
in the other room.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.480
That’s good. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.960
That’s my finger.
No, that’s my finger. That’s my finger.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.720
You want a time-out?
Want a time-out? Want a time-out?

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.960
My finger, my finger.
Let go, let go, let go.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.280
- Thank you.
- Dooley!

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.440
- I’m not gonna share.
- Dooley, come here!

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.120
- What?
- Come here.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.720
- What? - This guy- This
guy is writing about you.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.680
He’s got everything. He’s got the
bank shoot-out, Harry Stipe, Fat Tommy.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.640
- Who wrote this?
- Um, I don’t know. A guy named Jeffery Barnes.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.240
- Probably a fake name.
- Barnes.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.440
- No.
- These all have different pen names.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.560
Who’s the hero?

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.520

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.480
I don’t know why I-
I know Devon Lane.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.680
Devon Lane turned in
a manuscript to Tracy.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.680
She rejected it,
but she wanted me to meet with him...

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.760
to talk to him about
what is was like to be a cop.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.120
He was really strange.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.480
He kept staring at her
through the whole-

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.400
Wait.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.800

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.320
Whimpers
- Come on, come on, come on. Leave me the marshmallows.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.520
Telephone Ringing

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.880
She’s calling, probably to apologize.
Come on.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.800
Ringing Continues

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.120
Hello. You know,
you could’ve stayed for breakfast.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.960
Devon I heard you finally got
around to reading my masterpiece.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.560
Poignant, huh?

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.520
You wanna know the ending?

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.240
If you get to her first, she lives.
If you don’t, she dies.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.160
How’s that for real, Dooley?

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.680
See you soon.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.160
Dial Tone

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.240
Shit.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.200
Where’s that number?

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.120

Barking Continues

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.520
Pick it up!

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.120
Damn it!

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.000

Byers.
Hey, Dooley.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.480
What?
Wait, slow down. Slow down.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.400
What are you talking about?

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.080
He’s after her.
Welles, that’s who! Welles!

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.680
Oh, no, no.
Come on. Huh?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.640
He would never come here.
He’s not that crazy.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.680
- Listen to me! Welles
You’re completely surrounded.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.960
- Shut up!
- You’re in a police station,

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.880
- for Gods sakes.
- Oh, my God.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.840

Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.760
What are you doing with all these
tickets? You’re following me!

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.120
You got a vengeance-
A boot? You put-

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.920
I need a ride! There’s an emergency
going on. I need to take-

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.120
Here. Here, I’m sorry.
You want this?

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.280
You want this?
That’s what I think- Hey!

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.880
Get in.
Ill show her.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.880
Hmm!

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.920
Officer
Get down! Get down!

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.960

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.560
Devon
Take your shot!

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.520
- Goddamn it! Put your gun down!
Byers Hold your fire! Get down!

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.720
- Stop that man! Welles
Everybody get down!

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.200
Devon Shut up!
- Its all over.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.400
Byers
Lay down, everybody! Lay down!

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.400
Oh, for crying out loud.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.120
Byers
Hold your fire! He’s backing out!

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.000
- Okay, lets move up! Come
on! Officer Move! Move!

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.200
Come here!

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.360
Zeus, go on back!

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.400
Gunfire Continues Welles Back up!

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.280
- You’ll never make it out of the building.
- That’s not the ending I wrote.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.880
- Hey!
- Well, the good guy finally arrives,

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.200
just in time to see
another loved one die.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.240
Let her go.
This is between you and me.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.600
I got the station locked down, Dooley.
He cant get out.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.720
Now, put the gun down,
Devon, and nobody gets hurt!

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.080
Did you know
he killed his wife?

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.240
I didn’t kill her.
Tracy was very sick, and she died.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.200
Sick of you.
Sick of being a cops wife.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.840
You drove her
to an early grave.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.760
Growling

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.960
- Get your dog back. Get him
back, Dooley. Dooley Cant do that.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.960
You think
he listens to me?

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.400
Get your dog back, Dooley. Get him
back, or Ill shoot him right now.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.360
Tracy loved that dog.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.000
- Loved that dog more than anything.
- Not more than me.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.800
- She didn’t even know you!
- Yes, she did. She read my book.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.960
That’s me in that book.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.240
She said I had potential.
She believed in me.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.360
Dooley I’m sorry I didn’t like your book.
- You didn’t even read it.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.320
I read part of it.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.920
Devon Tracy didn’t have any
problems with my writing being real.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.400
She liked my work!
I wont shoot the dog. I’ll shoot her.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.360
- Shoot him, Dooley. Just take him out.
- Shut up!

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.680
- Shut up, Byers! - Shut
up, Byers! - Shoot him!

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.160
Shut up!
I’m not gonna shoot him.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.800
- He needs help!
- I don’t need help.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.760
- Yes, you do.
Growling

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.120
Tracy would want you
to get help.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.360
- She would?
- Yes, she would.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.000
- You’re just saying that.
- No, I’m not.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.120
- You’re lying to me.
- I’m not.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.720
Yes, you are.
You’re lying to me.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.160
All right.
I’m lying to you.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.240
I cant help you.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.520
I don’t wanna help you. You’re an idiot.
You’re a nut. You’re a jerk.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.160
You understand English,
or do I need to speak in Dutch?

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.040
Zeus!
Dutch

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.200

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.080

- Yeah.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.520
Byers
He’s going upstairs! Let’s go!

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.960
Come on, Dooley!
You can make it!

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.520
Only two more flights,

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.640
I need E.M.S. vehicles and a SWAT team
on the roof. Right away!

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:41.640
You’re pathetic, Dooley!

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.360
What Tracy saw in you,
Ill never know.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.360
Groaning
- You didn’t deserve her!

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.680
Aah!

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.040
She said my character
was strong.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.600
She said I had potential!

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.000
Come on, Dooley!

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.120
Come on, old man!

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.560
Panting, Groaning

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.960
She wrote me a letter, Dooley!
She ever write you a letter?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.920
You moron!

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.440
That letter she wrote you
was a rejection letter!

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.520
Rejection?

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.680
- Aah!
- How do you like the ending to my book, Dooley?

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.880
- Do it!
- Ill do it when I’m ready.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.560
Do it!

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.080
Go ahead!
Do it!

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.520
Shut up!

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.720
I’m in control here, Dooley.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.040
This is my story,
not yours!

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.560
Where do you want it?

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.480
Cause I’m deciding where you
should get the next bullet.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.440
You got any preferences?

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.760
Is this real enough for you,
Dooley?

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.440
- You did it! What took you so long?
Whimpering

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.920
Indistinct Shouting
- I knew you could do it, buddy.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.760

Jerry Lee Barking

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.800
Wait!
You cant have dogs in here.

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:03.160
They’re police officers,
ma´am.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.080
They’re dogs!
Get them out of here.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:08.120
The California State Health Code,
section 4578, says absolutely...

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.240
under no circumstances are dogs
allowed in the hospital.

What? Come on.
Jerry Lee.

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.440
Come on. Don’t slime me.
Your breath is so bad.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.520
What have you been eating?
Chuckling

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.640
Okay. I’m okay.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.000
Don’t do that!
Groans

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.200
Welles, I wanna thank you
for picking me up.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.200
Are you actually showing me
some gratitude, Dooley?

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.800
- Well, yeah, I’m trying.
- Good boy.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.920
- I am not a dog.
- Yes, you are.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.840
- Dogs get treats.
- Treats?

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.160
Dinner. What do you want?
Chinese or Italian?

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.320
Oh, you pick.
Your choice.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.800
- Oh, you’re actually giving me a choice?
- Yes, your choice.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.000
- Well, then I pick Chinese.
- Chinese is fine.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.280
No, that’s what you wanted me to say.
We’re going for Italian.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.720
- Well, Italian is fine.
- You actually want Italian?

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.640
- Yes.
- Then we are going for Chinese.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:47.960
- Chinese is fine. I don’t care.
- Yeah, sure you don’t.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.240
