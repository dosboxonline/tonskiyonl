01:32.711 --> 01:33.636
Hello.

01:33.716 --> 01:34.726
Hello.

01:34.870 --> 01:38.434
IK Mishra.
Deputy Council of Indian Embassy.

01:38.861 --> 01:39.907
Go on.

01:39.987 --> 01:40.887
Thank you.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.416
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:47.496 --> 01:48.371
Come.

02:06.485 --> 02:07.579
Hello.

02:07.659 --> 02:08.741
Hello.

02:09.412 --> 02:11.301
Please, have a seat, Mr. Mishra.

02:19.230 --> 02:21.859
Mr. Mishra, as you know.
Things are more complex now.

02:24.390 --> 02:27.088
It's all over in the local newspaper also.

02:27.662 --> 02:30.561
You know we live in
a conservative society here.

02:30.879 --> 02:33.799
This can make a few people uncomfortable.

02:34.491 --> 02:35.349
I understand.

02:36.388 --> 02:40.369
You have half an hour to decide if
you want to give him any legal assistance.

02:41.338 --> 02:43.915
We're framing charges against him soon.

02:57.911 --> 02:58.886
Mr. Sameer.

03:08.482 --> 03:10.475
I am from the Indian Embassy.

03:10.555 --> 03:13.718
Deputy Council of Affairs, IK Mishra.

03:15.894 --> 03:17.378
You asked for our help...

03:17.458 --> 03:18.644
...and that's exactly why I am here.

03:18.724 --> 03:23.521
Look Sameer, the Indian Embassy
cannot interfere greatly...

03:23.601 --> 03:26.180
...in local matters regarding civilians.

03:26.613 --> 03:29.441
And obviously, you don't
have diplomatic immunity.

03:30.090 --> 03:33.636
Yet if you're looking for any kind of help
from the embassy...

03:35.029 --> 03:36.992
...then I need every detail.

03:37.072 --> 03:38.618
And the entire truth.

03:40.650 --> 03:41.939
Start from the beginning.

03:48.998 --> 03:51.676
'You'll be joining
me in a couple of days.'

03:56.820 --> 03:59.390
I want my Nargis back. That's it.

04:26.498 --> 04:31.443
By the way Sameer, I've a hint about
mechanical and electronic engineering...

04:31.663 --> 04:36.084
...but is software engineer
also related to computers?

04:36.541 --> 04:39.395
Institutes of business
that run on computers...

04:39.475 --> 04:41.852
...it's my job to see
that they function properly.

04:41.932 --> 04:44.126
Solving problems related to
computers, running diagnostics...

04:44.303 --> 04:46.019
Meaning a doctor for computers.

04:46.496 --> 04:47.866
Although he's an engineer.

04:49.264 --> 04:50.405
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

04:51.422 --> 04:52.896
Even we bought one for Nargis.

04:52.976 --> 04:54.252
Saves an awful lot of time.

04:54.332 --> 04:56.003
Paying bills, tracking expenses...

04:56.439 --> 04:57.844
All takes a matter of minutes.

04:58.279 --> 04:59.483
There she is.

05:09.712 --> 05:10.775
Hello, aunty.

05:11.178 --> 05:11.935
Hello, uncle.

05:12.015 --> 05:12.851
God bless you.

05:13.649 --> 05:15.587
So glad to see you again.

05:16.251 --> 05:17.040
Sit down.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.266
That's Sameer.

05:21.939 --> 05:22.944
Hi.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.285
Come.

05:27.171 --> 05:28.084
Sit, son.

05:28.361 --> 05:29.240
Take a seat.

05:30.893 --> 05:32.927
We old folks already had a word.

05:33.007 --> 05:34.657
But you guys must be wondering...

05:34.737 --> 05:40.451
...even though ours was a love marriage...

05:40.531 --> 05:42.932
...we're instrumenting this meeting.

05:43.529 --> 05:48.027
It's all about finding an
amazing life-partner like mine.

05:48.547 --> 05:50.264
One way or another.

05:53.683 --> 05:55.707
Instead of these awkward moments...

05:55.787 --> 05:57.393
...let's have a proper conversation.

05:57.921 --> 05:59.331
Take him to the courtyard, dear.

06:00.983 --> 06:02.211
Go on, son.

06:08.144 --> 06:08.941
Take a seat.

06:09.021 --> 06:09.932
You first.

06:27.768 --> 06:29.487
Can I ask you a question directly?

06:30.917 --> 06:31.816
Yes.

06:33.279 --> 06:35.535
Are you opting for this marriage
under family pressure?

06:36.808 --> 06:38.800
I mean maybe you love someone else.

06:39.519 --> 06:40.896
As in an affair.

06:41.795 --> 06:45.608
And you're marrying me
because your family wants you to.

06:47.096 --> 06:49.919
Who said I want to marry you?

06:51.613 --> 06:53.661
No one said so...

06:53.741 --> 06:58.063
I mean you don't have to
marry me if you don't want to.

06:58.455 --> 07:02.208
Are you saying this because
you're having an affair?

07:03.944 --> 07:06.317
Why would I see your
resume if I had an affair?

07:07.272 --> 07:08.014
Sorry...

07:08.094 --> 07:08.773
As in...

07:08.853 --> 07:09.941
What's it called?

07:10.021 --> 07:12.859
Something like a profile
used for finding a match...

07:12.939 --> 07:14.061
I understood.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.242
Bio-Data.

07:16.322 --> 07:17.425
Bio-Data, yes.

07:18.394 --> 07:22.873
Even though I've a job, I feel
like I'm applying over and over again.

07:22.953 --> 07:23.694
Me too.

07:23.889 --> 07:27.383
Thank God.
At least we've something in common.

07:30.283 --> 07:34.735
I only said this because
I had a friend who experienced this.

07:35.496 --> 07:40.379
A year after their marriage his wife
realised that she loved her ex-boyfriend.

07:41.105 --> 07:42.724
And she went back to him.

07:42.804 --> 07:45.437
The families together
spent 2 million on the wedding.

07:46.454 --> 07:47.983
So it's a bit scary.

07:48.336 --> 07:51.553
Because the girls these
days are much faster than boys.

07:54.418 --> 07:56.328
We have to be fast.

07:57.130 --> 07:58.361
There's nothing wrong with that.

07:58.915 --> 07:59.448
I see...

07:59.528 --> 08:02.479
I mean we've to handle
our job and our home.

08:02.770 --> 08:05.212
So fast cooking, catch a bus...

08:05.292 --> 08:06.056
I didn't mean in that way...

08:06.136 --> 08:10.076
Come back home, cook again,
clean the plates.

08:10.243 --> 08:13.791
Girls have to be fast in today's age.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.190
Look, housewives are still okay.

08:18.353 --> 08:20.684
But what choice does a working woman have?
This shouldn't be a problem.

08:21.164 --> 08:26.304
I feel boys can't balance
work and home as girls do.

08:27.393 --> 08:33.794
"As you became the
embodiment of my feelings."

08:42.122 --> 08:48.965
"As you became the
embodiment of my feelings."

08:49.491 --> 08:55.532
"A permanent member in my heart."

08:56.764 --> 09:03.344
"Words alone can't praise you."

09:04.052 --> 09:10.716
"You became my life."

09:11.352 --> 09:17.909
"You became my life."

09:18.526 --> 09:25.253
"You became my God, my faith."

09:26.108 --> 09:32.430
"You became my life."

09:47.215 --> 09:53.654
"Destiny has made you my companion."

09:54.260 --> 10:00.871
"Like my dreams have come true."

10:01.649 --> 10:08.044
"I've attained what I never imagined."

10:08.817 --> 10:15.280
"There's nothing else
I want from God now."

10:16.612 --> 10:22.576
"You're like a blessing from God."

10:23.921 --> 10:29.777
"My dream that's come true."

10:31.221 --> 10:37.651
"Words alone can't praise you."

10:38.405 --> 10:44.838
"You became my life."

10:45.581 --> 10:51.635
"You became my life."

10:52.556 --> 10:59.250
"You became my God, my faith."

11:00.011 --> 11:06.314
"You became my life."

11:06.584 --> 11:07.930
"You're my God..."

11:08.010 --> 11:09.699
"You're my faith."

11:09.779 --> 11:13.674
"I bow before you."

11:13.754 --> 11:15.555
"I only wish for love..."

11:15.635 --> 11:17.342
"...that is my duty."

11:17.422 --> 11:20.033
"I am in love."

11:21.002 --> 11:22.771
"You're my God..."

11:22.851 --> 11:24.140
"You're my faith."

11:24.220 --> 11:27.743
"I bow before you."

11:28.274 --> 11:29.782
"I only wish for love..."

11:29.862 --> 11:32.145
"...that is my duty."

11:32.331 --> 11:34.787
"I am in love."

11:35.601 --> 11:38.627
"You became my life."

11:46.209 --> 11:47.512
'Prime Minister Manmohan Singh...'

11:47.592 --> 11:49.793
'...here in India to speak
out on the financial crises...'

11:49.873 --> 11:52.785
'...and he warns that India
must brace for slowdown impact.'

11:52.865 --> 11:56.542
'The recession began last
December maybe far from over.'

11:56.622 --> 12:00.213
'Financials took a big beating,
Sensex down almost 20%'

12:01.838 --> 12:04.281
'This is the biggest
economic crises of this era.'

12:04.361 --> 12:07.877
'The Economic crises that began in
America has taken over the entire world.'

12:07.957 --> 12:11.127
'There isn't a single sector
that's facing this problem.'

12:11.207 --> 12:13.141
'Can the Manmohan Singh government...'

12:13.221 --> 12:14.915
'...save the country's economy
from this financial crises.'

12:14.995 --> 12:18.540
'The economy was formerly and
officially declared in recession.'

12:18.798 --> 12:21.838
'The Indian economy
is not in a good condition.'

12:21.918 --> 12:24.705
'Inspite all the efforts
to contain this crises...'

12:24.785 --> 12:27.804
'...the GDP numbers have
revealed the condition.'

12:27.884 --> 12:32.420
'Shop-owners claim there is no demand...'

12:34.042 --> 12:34.604
Hello.

12:34.684 --> 12:37.209
Sameer, this is Parag
from Agarwal and Sons.

12:37.289 --> 12:38.914
Yes, sir, how may I help you?

12:38.994 --> 12:41.425
Sameer, I am speaking
from the HR Department.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.985
We won't need your
services from next month.

12:45.161 --> 12:48.281
Whatever your pending dues
are please come and collect them.

12:48.551 --> 12:51.838
Why, sir?
Did I or my team...make a mistake?

12:52.086 --> 12:54.190
I don't know about that, Sameer.
It's the management's decision.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.615
We were only supposed to inform you.

12:55.695 --> 12:56.783
Sorry. Bye.

13:04.914 --> 13:05.959
What happened, Sameer sir?

13:43.940 --> 13:46.099
Hey... what happened?

13:47.275 --> 13:48.292
What happened?

13:50.832 --> 13:52.313
Did someone misbehave?

13:53.080 --> 13:54.962
Hey...what are you looking at?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.066
What did you say to her?

13:57.146 --> 13:58.200
- Sameer!
- What did you say?

13:58.280 --> 14:00.858
- Sameer!
- Leave him.

14:00.938 --> 14:02.677
- Leave him.
- Come outside.

14:02.757 --> 14:03.911
Are you mad?

14:04.333 --> 14:06.906
No Sameer, no one said anything.

14:07.893 --> 14:09.408
Then why are you crying?

14:11.020 --> 14:12.576
I am sorry, Sameer.

14:14.237 --> 14:17.570
Why are you apologising, sweetheart?

14:18.416 --> 14:19.595
I got fired.

14:20.904 --> 14:23.914
They fired 16 people
from different departments.

14:23.994 --> 14:26.598
I didn't think I'll lose my job, but...

14:27.013 --> 14:29.614
But this is not your fault.

14:30.728 --> 14:32.901
The world over is facing this crisis.

14:33.578 --> 14:36.021
Don't worry, I am there.

14:36.732 --> 14:37.853
Are you okay?

14:43.028 --> 14:43.686
Come on.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.541
Come on, let's go home.

15:18.303 --> 15:21.914
You've filled out
the job application form.

15:22.236 --> 15:26.118
Indian... Lucknow... I've both your forms.
Great.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.262
Photographs attached too. Great.

15:28.481 --> 15:31.249
Sameer, that will be 5000 rupees each.

15:42.960 --> 15:43.867
Akbar.

15:47.539 --> 15:50.512
Don't worry, we'll get the job.

15:52.233 --> 15:53.302
Frankly...

15:55.959 --> 15:58.869
I think you'll get a job
here in a couple of months...

15:58.949 --> 16:01.069
...and you can stay with mom and dad.

16:02.232 --> 16:05.725
I've no clue about
accommodation out there.

16:07.493 --> 16:10.697
Noman is a foreign country
about which we know nothing.

16:10.777 --> 16:13.886
With you around,
I'll have no problems at all.

16:14.495 --> 16:17.415
I can't imagine staying here without you.

16:17.761 --> 16:22.476
Yes, but only if I could go first
and check the accommodations...

16:24.036 --> 16:25.012
Sameer...

16:26.340 --> 16:28.602
I've started the paperwork.

16:29.301 --> 16:32.484
In the next couple of days you two
will start on a new life.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.161
Looking at the current situation...

16:35.722 --> 16:39.990
...only Arab countries can offer
a fat salary in such situations.

16:40.295 --> 16:41.651
The world's screaming recession.

16:41.731 --> 16:45.270
But those screams will
drown out in Noman's oil wells.

16:46.259 --> 16:46.937
Great.

16:59.384 --> 17:00.335
Papa.

17:09.136 --> 17:12.137
Is it absolutely necessary to go to Noman?

17:14.124 --> 17:15.829
There are no jobs here, papa.

17:16.127 --> 17:17.262
It's been 3-months.

17:19.233 --> 17:22.095
Anywhere is okay with me now.

17:26.557 --> 17:28.107
What about my savings...

17:28.187 --> 17:29.081
Please, papa.

17:30.603 --> 17:33.924
I know you and mom
will do anything for us.

17:35.821 --> 17:38.610
But I put aside that
money for your security.

17:39.397 --> 17:41.438
God forbid in the case of an emergency...

17:43.141 --> 17:45.390
And anyway, it's not only about the money.

17:45.470 --> 17:48.045
If we sit idle anymore
we'll start fighting.

17:54.311 --> 17:55.916
It's only a matter of time.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.448
I'll come back when I've saved enough.

18:47.810 --> 18:48.780
Come in. Come in.

18:48.860 --> 18:49.907
Hello.

18:49.987 --> 18:50.831
Hello.

18:51.009 --> 18:51.922
Take a seat.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.450
- Nadeem sir.
- Sameer.

18:54.065 --> 18:55.670
- Come.
- Hello.

18:56.377 --> 18:59.718
Congratulations, Nargis,
your confirmation letter has arrived.

19:00.195 --> 19:01.538
Thank God.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.122
You must leave tomorrow.

19:04.941 --> 19:07.100
What about Sameer?

19:07.459 --> 19:09.390
Yours will arrive in
a couple of days as well.

19:09.688 --> 19:12.130
A couple of days more?

19:12.476 --> 19:13.078
Yes.

19:13.158 --> 19:15.348
You mean Nargis and I can't go together.

19:17.202 --> 19:20.606
You see, Nargis never
set foot out of Lucknow alone.

19:20.686 --> 19:23.928
So if we could go together,
I could help her settle down.

19:25.049 --> 19:26.689
How will she manage on her own?

19:26.992 --> 19:30.583
You see Sameer, you both
have applied in separate companies.

19:31.115 --> 19:33.855
Whoever gets the confirmation
first will have to go.

19:35.322 --> 19:38.108
If she doesn't go now we'll
have to find another job for her.

19:38.188 --> 19:39.568
Another month gone by.

19:39.983 --> 19:41.492
I'll do it if you say so.

19:43.077 --> 19:44.045
It's alright.

19:45.459 --> 19:47.839
You'll join me in a couple of days.

19:54.018 --> 19:57.922
Don't worry. Nargis isn't going alone.

19:58.254 --> 19:59.975
She'll be travelling with other girls.

20:01.322 --> 20:03.606
Now, do I send her confirmation?

20:05.529 --> 20:06.705
It's okay.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.606
Sign here.

20:24.495 --> 20:26.051
- Bye dear.
- Bye mom.

20:26.949 --> 20:28.270
Look after yourself.

20:32.268 --> 20:33.358
Goodbye.

20:33.531 --> 20:35.756
Call as soon as you land.
Go.

20:40.552 --> 20:41.417
Can I go?

20:42.109 --> 20:42.930
No...

20:44.577 --> 20:46.743
But we'll meet soon.

20:47.843 --> 20:50.119
Call as soon as you land.

20:56.276 --> 20:58.303
Nargis...come on.

21:36.656 --> 21:37.991
- Sameer.
- Yes, mom.

21:38.462 --> 21:40.413
Did Nargis call?

21:40.627 --> 21:43.167
No, mom. Her Indian
number is switched off.

21:43.247 --> 21:45.099
She will call as soon
as she gets a new sim.

22:20.871 --> 22:21.598
Hello.

22:21.779 --> 22:22.515
Sameer.

22:23.284 --> 22:23.872
Nargis!

22:23.952 --> 22:26.045
I want to come back home, Sameer.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.113
Nargis, where are you?

22:28.193 --> 22:31.054
This is not the place
where I applied for the job.

22:31.434 --> 22:32.866
Can I talk to someone, Nargis?

22:32.946 --> 22:34.951
I am being treated very badly, Sameer.

22:35.031 --> 22:37.414
- Please come and take me home.
- Yes, Nargis...

22:37.494 --> 22:39.807
Listen to me...
Is there anyone around you?

22:41.395 --> 22:42.497
Nargis.

22:42.577 --> 22:43.773
- Nargis.
- Leave me.

22:43.853 --> 22:45.780
- Hello...?
- Leave me.

23:23.495 --> 23:24.429
Sameer.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.670
Sameer.

23:28.375 --> 23:29.434
Sameer.

23:29.835 --> 23:32.049
What's the matter, son? Who was it?

23:32.818 --> 23:33.696
Nargis.

23:33.849 --> 23:34.803
Nargis?

23:36.091 --> 23:38.056
What happened to Nargis?

23:38.136 --> 23:40.409
What's the matter?

23:41.052 --> 23:42.623
Where are you going?

23:43.017 --> 23:45.349
Tell me something.

24:05.457 --> 24:06.605
Where is my wife?

24:07.443 --> 24:09.615
Nargis called and she sounded very scared.

24:10.313 --> 24:12.775
She said they took her
someplace else instead of...

24:12.855 --> 24:13.835
...the company you
claimed getting her a job.

24:14.346 --> 24:15.931
Where did you send my wife?

24:16.706 --> 24:19.868
Why will I send her anywhere, Sameer?
I am worried about her myself.

24:21.404 --> 24:22.518
I was going to call you...

24:22.598 --> 24:26.489
...but then I thought about
assessing the situation myself.

24:27.408 --> 24:30.148
My agent called in the morning...

24:30.847 --> 24:32.328
He said that the woman...

24:32.408 --> 24:37.347
Meaning, Nargis, she never
arrived at the pickup point

24:37.427 --> 24:40.114
outside the airport
as she was supposed to.

24:40.299 --> 24:41.545
He didn't see anyone there.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.067
What do you mean she didn't show up?

24:44.368 --> 24:45.323
Who picked her up?

24:45.403 --> 24:46.250
I don't know.

24:46.330 --> 24:47.939
Nadeem, we want answers.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.455
You mean some strangers
will pick her up...

24:50.880 --> 24:52.312
...and she will go with them.

24:53.449 --> 24:54.395
Who are these people?

24:54.475 --> 24:59.013
If we know about Nargis' whereabouts
we can go looking for her.

24:59.093 --> 25:01.071
When we don't know where she is,
where are we going to look for her?

25:01.151 --> 25:02.344
What do you mean go look for her?

25:02.505 --> 25:04.878
We'll get all the details from her,
Chaudhary sir.

25:04.958 --> 25:09.604
But your daughter-in-law's
gone missing in a foreign country.

25:09.684 --> 25:11.942
You must go over to Noman
and take the help of...

25:12.022 --> 25:15.672
...the Indian Embassy and the local Police
and get to the bottom of this.

25:16.322 --> 25:18.889
If I am not on the next flight to Noman

25:18.969 --> 25:21.953
then I'll reduce you
and your shop to ashes.

25:22.262 --> 25:27.882
Tell your Nomani agent to get me business,
tourist or any other visa.

25:27.962 --> 25:30.518
I want his name, address,
and telephone address.

25:30.598 --> 25:32.248
Send me to Noman right now.

25:33.865 --> 25:34.695
I'll do something.

25:34.775 --> 25:38.004
Give me his details now.

25:38.506 --> 25:39.820
Here, write it down.

26:41.132 --> 26:42.402
Tourist visa.

26:43.578 --> 26:44.564
Camera.

26:49.469 --> 26:50.288
Move on.

26:53.918 --> 26:54.908
Left hand.

27:13.494 --> 27:14.297
Move.

27:14.476 --> 27:15.570
Go, go.

27:39.169 --> 27:39.944
Taxi.

27:44.576 --> 27:46.554
Greetings, young man.

27:54.645 --> 27:56.735
Pakistani? Hindi?

27:57.088 --> 27:57.738
Hindi.

27:57.818 --> 27:58.970
Marvellous.

27:59.050 --> 28:01.938
And I am Usman Hamid Ali Murad.

28:02.275 --> 28:04.801
Welcome to Noman.
Come, come.

28:08.675 --> 28:11.654
I urgently need a calling
card or find me a PCO.

28:12.234 --> 28:15.356
It'll take only 10 minutes.
I'll get you one.

28:38.357 --> 28:40.363
There.

28:54.295 --> 28:57.402
Indian currency exchange for 26,000

28:59.781 --> 29:00.451
Passport.

29:06.518 --> 29:08.926
350 Riyad for 260,000 rupees.

29:09.357 --> 29:10.409
Are you Indian?

29:10.625 --> 29:11.344
Pakistan.

29:13.649 --> 29:14.970
And a calling card too.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.049
Yes.

29:43.519 --> 29:45.133
'The number you have
dialled is not reachable.'

29:46.946 --> 29:49.263
'The number you have
dialled is not reachable.'

30:32.797 --> 30:34.258
Take me to this address.

30:34.691 --> 30:35.703
This address.

30:35.783 --> 30:37.407
But this address isn't right.

30:38.108 --> 30:40.242
The area code is wrong.

30:40.322 --> 30:41.965
What do you mean wrong area code?

30:42.045 --> 30:46.877
The address in Noman
is according to the area code.

30:47.171 --> 30:49.860
I've been driving a taxi for 21 years...

30:49.940 --> 30:51.806
...but never seen this code before.

30:52.005 --> 30:53.761
Please, can you ask someone?

30:53.841 --> 30:55.196
Of course, of course.

30:55.276 --> 30:58.172
Bilal, telephone directory.

30:59.539 --> 31:00.628
Thank you.

31:01.337 --> 31:07.459
There are 26 areas of our city Noor Saba.

31:07.539 --> 31:09.034
With 26 codes.

31:10.167 --> 31:11.568
Yours is 27th.

31:12.562 --> 31:13.859
There is no such code.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.892
See. Take a look.

31:16.264 --> 31:18.175
So whoever gave you this address...

31:18.255 --> 31:20.155
...ask him why he gave
you the wrong address and code.

31:30.841 --> 31:31.547
Hello.

31:31.627 --> 31:32.693
- Junaid.
- Yes Sameer.

31:32.773 --> 31:34.661
I am speaking from Noman Police Station.

31:35.007 --> 31:38.315
Get that agent Nadeem on the phone.

31:38.395 --> 31:42.336
Because the number he gave
me of the agent is switched off...

31:42.520 --> 31:44.823
...and the address
he gave us doesn't exist.

31:45.039 --> 31:47.796
Get him on the phone now.
Tell him I am at the Police Station.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.433
Sameer, Nadeem's disappeared
since last night.

31:52.466 --> 31:55.372
The Police interrogated
him last night and let him go.

31:55.977 --> 31:59.912
He's been missing ever since.
We've been trying to find him.

32:00.337 --> 32:02.352
I think he escaped.

32:13.340 --> 32:16.609
Tell them to file a
Missing Person report now.

32:16.851 --> 32:18.244
Of course, of course.

32:38.627 --> 32:40.703
That's the rule here.

32:45.127 --> 32:45.812
Sir...

32:46.199 --> 32:47.527
No trouble making.

32:51.824 --> 32:53.602
- Sir...if you know, then...
- Stop.

32:59.494 --> 33:00.592
Sit down.

33:02.244 --> 33:04.164
'I want to come back home, Sameer.'

33:16.180 --> 33:17.349
Indian Embassy.

33:19.071 --> 33:20.068
How much?

33:20.524 --> 33:21.437
10.

33:23.983 --> 33:25.432
Thank you.

33:26.253 --> 33:28.794
May God alleviate all your problems.

33:29.897 --> 33:32.880
I am going for Namaz
and will pray for you.

33:33.357 --> 33:35.682
Call immediately if you need me.

34:00.295 --> 34:01.278
May I help you.

34:01.358 --> 34:03.957
Ms. Sonia, my name is Sameer Chaudhary.

34:04.037 --> 34:05.989
I just arrived today from India.

34:06.437 --> 34:09.896
My wife Nargis Chaudhary
who arrived here on 9th March...

34:10.305 --> 34:11.595
...and has gone missing.

34:12.088 --> 34:15.242
But she called on the same
night and sounded very scared.

34:15.322 --> 34:17.931
And she said they are mistreating her.

34:19.607 --> 34:21.447
She didn't know where she is.

34:22.126 --> 34:25.410
I am very scared, Ms. Sonia.

34:26.016 --> 34:28.673
I even went to the local
Police Station but they...

34:28.753 --> 34:30.341
Wait a minute.
Please hold on.

34:30.421 --> 34:34.326
This is a very serious
issue and I cannot help you.

34:34.638 --> 34:38.311
Someone senior like the Deputy Council
General handles matters like these.

34:38.519 --> 34:41.307
Unfortunately, he's out of town right now.

34:41.625 --> 34:43.466
I'll make a formal
complaint from you now...

34:43.546 --> 34:45.078
...and as soon as he arrives
the day after tomorrow...

34:45.158 --> 34:47.403
But the day after tomorrow
will be too late, Ms. Sonia.

34:47.876 --> 34:50.307
My wife sounded very scared...

34:51.196 --> 34:53.313
...and the company's address was fake.

34:53.393 --> 34:57.126
The Police want you to verify
that my complaint is genuine.

34:58.412 --> 34:59.526
Imagine...

35:00.772 --> 35:02.086
I don't know where my wife is.

35:02.166 --> 35:03.874
What am I going to do here for two days

35:05.132 --> 35:06.848
You know the system better.

35:06.928 --> 35:08.542
Please help me.

35:08.724 --> 35:09.504
Please.

35:09.584 --> 35:11.751
Mr. Sameer, I understand.

35:12.166 --> 35:16.763
Okay, I'll send an email to
his personal assistant marked urgent...

35:16.953 --> 35:19.833
...and request him
to help you immediately.

35:20.456 --> 35:22.704
That's the all I can do for you right now.

35:23.007 --> 35:24.711
Please have some patience.

35:26.777 --> 35:28.576
Can I get your number?

35:28.732 --> 35:29.465
Yes.

35:29.545 --> 35:36.675
+786...99...72...14...

35:36.755 --> 35:38.988
What was the name if
your Deputy Commissioner?

35:39.068 --> 35:41.994
- His name is IK Mishra.
- IK Mishra.

36:27.556 --> 36:28.586
Any luck.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.002
Are they going to help you?

36:32.524 --> 36:33.396
Don't know...

36:33.476 --> 36:35.451
The guy who can help me isn't in town.

36:36.371 --> 36:38.059
But I can't wait for him.

36:48.831 --> 36:49.534
Wife.

36:57.606 --> 36:58.704
Bye.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.098
Which cellular provider's number is this?

37:03.643 --> 37:04.413
Nomaltel.

37:04.493 --> 37:05.719
Same as mine.

37:06.409 --> 37:07.634
Do they have a local showroom?

37:08.526 --> 37:09.183
They do.

37:09.826 --> 37:10.871
And it's not too far either.

37:11.481 --> 37:13.328
But it will open tomorrow morning.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.590
What are you thinking, brother?

37:20.054 --> 37:21.322
I am not sure.

37:25.486 --> 37:26.697
Look Sameer...

37:29.922 --> 37:32.274
I can understand pain.

37:35.111 --> 37:38.114
But I don't know how to help you.

37:39.892 --> 37:43.334
And coincidentally I've
to go to Baitusaif tomorrow.

37:43.414 --> 37:45.181
My wife and kid live there.

37:45.548 --> 37:47.298
And I've to go urgently.

37:49.339 --> 37:51.463
Don't hesitate if you need my help.

37:52.632 --> 37:53.995
Call immediately.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.341
Have faith in God.

38:50.301 --> 38:51.053
Thank you.

38:54.242 --> 38:54.823
Yes.

38:55.194 --> 38:55.786
Hindi.

38:56.174 --> 38:57.297
Bangla. Tell me.

38:58.094 --> 39:00.651
My boss' phone isn't working.
I guess the line's disconnected.

39:00.731 --> 39:03.343
He's asked me to check
what the problem is.

39:03.423 --> 39:04.623
If the bill's unpaid then I'll pay it.

39:05.505 --> 39:06.336
Number?

39:06.560 --> 39:10.193
786021272

39:12.089 --> 39:13.970
Pervez Al Shirazi.

39:17.018 --> 39:18.964
- Your boss?
- Yes.

39:19.716 --> 39:22.371
- The number's registered to him.
- Yes, sir.

39:23.816 --> 39:26.290
Billing address is for Baitusaif district.

39:26.370 --> 39:28.175
Why come this far to pay the bill?

39:28.711 --> 39:29.948
Just a minute.

39:35.865 --> 39:38.500
Sorry sir, I just want
to confirm the billing address.

39:38.697 --> 39:40.087
Because, if the billing
address is for home...

39:40.167 --> 39:41.475
...and the bill's been
delivered to the office...

39:41.555 --> 39:42.881
...then the bill must be unpaid.

39:44.265 --> 39:46.633
Pervez Al Shirazi.

39:46.713 --> 39:51.606
Colony 6, Flat 24, Jibiriya Town.

39:51.686 --> 39:52.925
Baitusaif.

39:53.563 --> 39:55.617
There's only one address registered here.

39:55.697 --> 39:56.961
It's the home address, isn't it?

39:58.726 --> 40:00.377
The bill's paid.

40:02.142 --> 40:03.344
The technical line is busy.

40:03.424 --> 40:05.151
Wait here. I'll be right back.

40:13.122 --> 40:15.155
Ms. Sonia. This is Sameer Chaudhary.

40:15.235 --> 40:18.879
I've the man's name and address
whose number my wife used to call me.

40:19.813 --> 40:22.519
The address is for Baitusaif.
I am heading there now.

40:23.037 --> 40:26.524
Any reply from the Deputy Council General?

40:26.912 --> 40:28.475
Not yet, Sameer.

40:28.697 --> 40:30.738
But I'll tell you as soon as he does.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.142
Ma'am, please help me as soon as you can.

40:34.488 --> 40:36.924
I understand, Sameer. We'll do our best.

41:51.498 --> 41:52.632
Parvez Al Shirazi.

41:55.478 --> 41:56.613
What is your name?

41:56.847 --> 41:58.839
Yasir Mehendi. Where are you from?

42:00.054 --> 42:02.726
Is this flat no. 24, lane no. 6?

42:03.069 --> 42:03.661
Yes.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.567
According to the address this
house belongs to Pervez Al Shirazi...

42:06.647 --> 42:08.680
...and I have the
telephone bill to prove it.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.993
Please call Pervez.

42:10.073 --> 42:11.951
You've come to the wrong address.

42:12.332 --> 42:14.345
I moved in here this week.

42:14.629 --> 42:16.481
That's the owner's house.

42:17.126 --> 42:20.468
But his name is Sayeed sir. Not Pervez.

42:39.899 --> 42:41.082
- Hello.
- Hello.

42:41.162 --> 42:42.051
Is that your house?

42:42.424 --> 42:44.091
I want to meet Pervez Al Shirazi.

42:44.171 --> 42:45.454
Where are you from, son?

42:45.534 --> 42:47.862
I am from Nomantel.
He hasn't paid his bill.

42:48.458 --> 42:52.623
Actually he vacated the
place 6 days ago and left.

42:53.635 --> 42:56.935
Do you have his new
address and phone number?

42:57.613 --> 42:58.776
His number is switched off.

42:58.856 --> 43:00.540
I've his old number.

43:00.620 --> 43:03.224
And I've no clue where he lives now.

43:04.737 --> 43:06.543
Do you have a picture of him?

43:06.623 --> 43:07.449
Picture?

43:07.816 --> 43:09.843
Why would I have a picture of him?

43:11.898 --> 43:13.206
Did you...

43:14.451 --> 43:16.291
...ever see him with this female?

43:19.969 --> 43:22.797
As far as I know, he lived here all alone.

43:22.978 --> 43:26.832
I've never seen him with any female.

43:27.289 --> 43:31.343
And...are you from Nomantel
or is this something else?

44:04.140 --> 44:05.917
Eat some more, son.

44:08.103 --> 44:11.483
Bravo. Bravo.

44:14.743 --> 44:15.945
Greet, uncle.

44:16.025 --> 44:17.026
Go and play outside.

44:31.639 --> 44:32.530
Drink your tea.

44:40.054 --> 44:41.305
I've a good friend.

44:43.038 --> 44:48.856
Until the Embassy doesn't lend any help
and the Police don't register your case...

44:49.289 --> 44:54.896
...I've told my friend to
find information about Shirazi.

44:56.070 --> 44:59.369
Whatever help he can give us
is all we can get.

45:06.877 --> 45:09.471
Thank you, Usman.

45:11.672 --> 45:12.707
I mean it.

45:14.401 --> 45:16.582
Forgive me for dragging you into all this.

45:17.667 --> 45:22.083
I didn't know where to go. What to do?

45:22.836 --> 45:24.125
Whom to ask for help.

45:24.821 --> 45:26.682
Don't embarrass me, brother.

45:27.588 --> 45:32.743
God made me a medium to help you.

45:33.503 --> 45:35.985
Meaning God is pleased with me.

45:37.220 --> 45:39.371
You did the right thing by calling me.

45:40.596 --> 45:43.564
This issue was pricking me.

45:53.596 --> 45:56.305
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

46:01.284 --> 46:02.873
Hello.

46:36.348 --> 46:38.486
What's wrong, Usman sir?
Why are you quiet?

46:39.192 --> 46:40.506
What's he saying?

46:40.728 --> 46:42.174
Tell me. I understand.

46:46.305 --> 46:48.484
I suggest we wait.

46:50.723 --> 46:54.252
We should let the Embassy
take care of this problem.

46:55.273 --> 46:56.631
Does he know him?

46:57.988 --> 47:02.010
Because Usman, I cannot
wait for any kind of help.

47:03.066 --> 47:05.101
Shirazi...

47:06.726 --> 47:08.878
he's into flesh trade.

47:10.386 --> 47:11.397
So what?

47:13.085 --> 47:14.406
I don't get it.

47:15.375 --> 47:17.443
He's a pimp.

47:18.572 --> 47:19.990
How is all this connected to Nargis?

47:20.070 --> 47:22.723
As I told you she came here to work...

47:24.336 --> 47:25.879
What do you want to say?

47:27.629 --> 47:32.984
Agents like Shirazi
use taxi to transport girls.

47:33.829 --> 47:36.445
Even I had to allow
them a couple of times.

47:36.863 --> 47:38.134
They are dangerous people.

47:38.420 --> 47:39.423
This is their business.

47:39.795 --> 47:47.066
I was praying to Allah that your
wife isn't with these dangerous people.

47:50.932 --> 47:52.420
This is Nargis.

47:52.721 --> 47:54.979
Have you seen her?

47:59.908 --> 48:00.593
No...

48:34.123 --> 48:35.501
Usman

48:37.204 --> 48:38.718
I beg you.

48:39.732 --> 48:41.704
Help me find my wife.

48:42.634 --> 48:44.095
Please.

49:00.555 --> 49:02.273
This is Baithusaif.

49:02.353 --> 49:04.498
And these are the two places.

49:04.578 --> 49:06.844
Bayat Ragba aur Dar Jamal.

49:06.924 --> 49:10.528
...where there's fair chance
of finding Nargis, brother.

49:10.608 --> 49:13.849
If she hasn't been sold to some Arab yet.

49:14.544 --> 49:16.630
Ya Ali, help!

49:16.768 --> 49:18.477
Let's maintain the story
that I am a businessman...

49:18.557 --> 49:20.338
...and came here to have some fun.

49:20.731 --> 49:22.710
And whenever I come here I hire your taxi.

49:27.227 --> 49:28.694
- Hello.
- Hello.

49:33.865 --> 49:34.585
Hello.

49:35.290 --> 49:36.279
Welcome.

49:54.359 --> 49:55.613
Hello.

49:55.925 --> 49:57.084
Come, come.

49:57.291 --> 49:58.415
Hello.

50:00.543 --> 50:01.823
Sit, sit.

50:30.755 --> 50:33.968
If you're looking for
an angel then try heaven.

51:12.041 --> 51:12.904
Hello.

51:12.984 --> 51:13.751
Hello.

51:43.351 --> 51:44.380
Sit, Pathan.

51:45.358 --> 51:46.145
Thank you.

51:49.851 --> 51:52.972
Tell the tourist to see what he wants.

51:53.781 --> 51:54.874
And you too.

52:51.911 --> 52:53.606
He'll take a look.

52:53.686 --> 52:54.630
Yes.

52:58.025 --> 52:58.942
Calm down.

53:14.641 --> 53:17.746
She is busy with another client.

53:19.957 --> 53:22.041
It will take 10 minutes.

53:23.923 --> 53:25.586
Pick someone else.

53:47.807 --> 53:49.149
I'll wait.

53:55.016 --> 53:56.581
I've a question.

53:57.031 --> 53:58.933
You're an Indian.

54:00.334 --> 54:04.045
And you want an Indian girl.

54:05.290 --> 54:06.103
Why?

54:08.879 --> 54:11.941
Not satisfied at home?

54:13.135 --> 54:14.436
Sheikh...

54:14.967 --> 54:19.171
Indians are not always based in India.

54:19.474 --> 54:22.094
Sometimes they venture
far from home, like us.

54:22.174 --> 54:27.448
That's why locals seem
even better in a foreign land.

54:30.225 --> 54:31.427
That's her.

55:12.625 --> 55:14.323
My name is Sameer.

55:16.338 --> 55:17.679
Will you come with me?

55:17.895 --> 55:21.026
Pathan, if he likes her...

55:21.189 --> 55:23.222
...then tell him to take her inside.

55:24.484 --> 55:27.589
Ask them I want to take her out.

55:28.765 --> 55:30.711
The girls don't go out.

55:30.791 --> 55:34.144
If you like her,
you can be with her all day.

55:34.707 --> 55:36.238
But right here.

55:49.190 --> 55:50.072
Sameer!

55:51.115 --> 55:52.236
Sameer!

55:53.794 --> 55:55.675
Wake up. Wake up.

55:56.598 --> 55:59.643
These two know each other.

55:59.723 --> 56:00.784
No.

56:02.646 --> 56:03.733
Listen to me.

56:25.599 --> 56:26.858
Nargis.

56:27.378 --> 56:29.108
Let's get out of here.

56:36.243 --> 56:38.011
Come, come.

57:01.342 --> 57:04.082
Go. go.
You two go.

57:37.522 --> 57:38.401
Nargis!

57:41.817 --> 57:42.952
Nargis!

58:15.429 --> 58:16.539
Nargis!

1:00:58.445 --> 1:01:00.424
Brother, get in.

1:01:00.504 --> 1:01:02.768
Get in. We must get out of here.

1:01:02.848 --> 1:01:04.073
I won't leave without Nargis.

1:01:04.592 --> 1:01:06.523
We must get out of here immediately.

1:01:06.782 --> 1:01:07.905
If we escape out of this alive we can

1:01:07.985 --> 1:01:09.394
take the help of the
Police and save your wife...

1:01:09.474 --> 1:01:10.944
...otherwise they will kill us.

1:01:12.079 --> 1:01:13.234
Get in.

1:01:19.614 --> 1:01:20.334
Usman.

1:01:22.045 --> 1:01:23.645
I can't drive.

1:01:24.182 --> 1:01:25.134
Let me drive.

1:02:40.212 --> 1:02:41.796
Scoundrel!

1:02:53.013 --> 1:02:54.137
Watch out!

1:03:29.424 --> 1:03:32.341
I want my Nargis. That's it.

1:03:33.941 --> 1:03:35.506
Then I'll go back.

1:03:39.364 --> 1:03:40.920
I know where she is.

1:03:45.521 --> 1:03:48.116
Please assure them that
I am telling the truth.

1:03:48.687 --> 1:03:50.477
We'll definitely do something, Sameer.

1:03:51.169 --> 1:03:52.017
Okay.

1:03:52.510 --> 1:03:53.876
Just give me sometime.

1:03:53.956 --> 1:03:55.142
Please, sir.

1:04:27.513 --> 1:04:28.592
Hello.

1:04:28.672 --> 1:04:29.713
Hello.

1:04:31.865 --> 1:04:33.740
Mr. IK Mishra, Indian Embassy.

1:04:34.239 --> 1:04:35.657
Mr. Foiz Abu Malik.

1:04:35.830 --> 1:04:37.290
International Security Agency.

1:04:42.347 --> 1:04:47.502
My Commander has told
me about the case in detail.

1:04:48.884 --> 1:04:55.464
Now I want to talk to
the Indian Prisoner alone.

1:04:56.822 --> 1:04:59.468
I've recorded the Indian
Citizen Sameer's statement.

1:05:00.776 --> 1:05:01.689
For the Embassy.

1:05:01.769 --> 1:05:03.924
And also verified his details from India.

1:05:04.104 --> 1:05:05.626
Would you like to hear it?

1:05:11.016 --> 1:05:12.248
With due respect, sir.

1:05:12.698 --> 1:05:14.995
It does not matter what you record.

1:05:17.299 --> 1:05:18.282
What matters...

1:05:19.444 --> 1:05:21.139
...is the law of my country.

1:05:26.921 --> 1:05:28.859
Let me find out the truth...

1:05:29.109 --> 1:05:31.929
...so we can help you.

1:05:54.753 --> 1:05:55.574
Cigarette?

1:06:05.072 --> 1:06:06.992
So you claim that you...

1:06:08.635 --> 1:06:13.591
came to Noman to save your wife.

1:06:13.671 --> 1:06:15.814
It's not a claim, it's the truth.

1:06:15.894 --> 1:06:17.682
You can check the evidence
I gave to the Police

1:06:17.762 --> 1:06:20.130
or the number where my wife called from.

1:06:20.964 --> 1:06:24.485
Or you can get a statement from the local
taxi driver Usman.

1:06:24.565 --> 1:06:27.433
Or the raid the place
where I found my wife.

1:06:28.063 --> 1:06:31.294
Why isn't anyone doing their
job instead of questioning me?

1:06:31.374 --> 1:06:34.337
Everyone's asking me questions
and wasting their time.

1:06:47.590 --> 1:06:52.364
Because the man from whose
number your wife called...

1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:56.726
...we found Pervez Al Shirazi's dead body.

1:06:57.805 --> 1:07:01.029
Two days ago someone murdered him.

1:07:02.115 --> 1:07:05.900
On the same day, you arrived in Noman.

1:07:06.428 --> 1:07:07.214
Am I right?

1:07:13.535 --> 1:07:20.013
Because the taxi driver
is unconscious in the hospital.

1:07:21.012 --> 1:07:28.804
And we don't know who did this to him.

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:36.400
That's why we're forced to question you.

1:07:37.741 --> 1:07:44.027
Because the building in which
you claim you saw your wife...

1:07:44.107 --> 1:07:48.265
That place is a sewing room for women.

1:07:57.613 --> 1:07:59.592
I want to help you.

1:08:01.128 --> 1:08:02.276
But you...

1:08:03.023 --> 1:08:09.702
This is your last chance
to tell us the truth.

1:08:45.149 --> 1:08:45.912
Where are we going?

1:11:20.297 --> 1:11:21.840
'Allah is Supreme.'

1:12:06.902 --> 1:12:08.099
Sameer!

1:12:08.179 --> 1:12:09.421
Sameer!

1:12:09.601 --> 1:12:10.410
No, Sameer!

1:12:51.867 --> 1:12:53.008
Sameer.

1:13:17.998 --> 1:13:19.165
Wait there.

1:13:37.544 --> 1:13:41.121
You're an escaped convict
in the eyes of the Law.

1:13:42.484 --> 1:13:48.378
We want to do our job in
secrecy away from prying eyes.

1:13:49.555 --> 1:13:52.340
My Department has found
evidence in your favour.

1:13:54.412 --> 1:13:56.598
My name is Faiz Abu Malik.

1:13:57.763 --> 1:14:03.197
And before we lose all
clues to find your wife, get in.

1:15:01.078 --> 1:15:01.987
Commander.

1:15:02.067 --> 1:15:05.654
I want you and Tamina
you both in this case.

1:15:05.734 --> 1:15:07.133
Yes, Commander.

1:15:07.980 --> 1:15:12.681
Don't worry, they will find your wife.

1:15:37.382 --> 1:15:39.197
I knew we had hope with you, Commander.

1:15:39.723 --> 1:15:41.433
Don't embarrass me, Mishra.

1:15:42.385 --> 1:15:45.031
India is a good friend
of the Sultanate of Noman.

1:15:58.571 --> 1:15:59.872
She was right in front of me.

1:16:04.825 --> 1:16:06.181
I couldn't save her.

1:16:14.303 --> 1:16:16.648
There's no point in
getting emotional, Sameer.

1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:18.614
It can make things worse.

1:16:20.385 --> 1:16:22.074
Usman is still unconscious.

1:16:22.336 --> 1:16:24.474
Only you can give us details.

1:16:24.554 --> 1:16:27.173
You're the sole witness of this case.

1:16:27.712 --> 1:16:29.456
So please cooperate, okay.

1:16:31.524 --> 1:16:33.635
Okay, Sameer, think
of the entire incident.

1:16:34.008 --> 1:16:36.209
From the beginning and in detail.

1:16:42.195 --> 1:16:45.976
The recruitment agent said
that his guy will pick up my wife...

1:16:47.515 --> 1:16:49.192
...and take her to company accommodations.

1:16:49.409 --> 1:16:51.507
She never showed up at the pickup point...

1:16:51.587 --> 1:16:54.459
...outside the airport
as she was supposed to.

1:16:54.539 --> 1:16:55.774
They didn't meet.

1:16:57.526 --> 1:17:01.589
So he was definitely lying
that my wife didn't meet him.

1:17:01.814 --> 1:17:02.774
Because they did.

1:17:02.999 --> 1:17:04.910
That's how they abducted her.

1:17:08.543 --> 1:17:09.598
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1:17:31.515 --> 1:17:34.170
Sameer, check every frame.

1:17:34.730 --> 1:17:35.746
Okay.

1:17:41.026 --> 1:17:44.624
Let's check from the point
where she arrived at the immigration.

1:17:58.632 --> 1:18:00.536
That's Nargis. In the middle.

1:18:03.305 --> 1:18:04.900
Zoom in. Zoom in.

1:18:15.605 --> 1:18:17.056
Someone's picking her up.

1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:29.482
Zoom in. Zoom in.

1:18:31.726 --> 1:18:34.857
He's standing like he
knows all the camera positions.

1:18:42.783 --> 1:18:45.029
The hell with these security cameras.

1:18:45.109 --> 1:18:47.209
I cannot see anything. Everything is hazy.

1:18:47.289 --> 1:18:48.428
Nothing is visible.

1:18:56.996 --> 1:18:57.723
Okay.

1:18:59.759 --> 1:19:02.138
Sameer, let's step out.

1:19:14.832 --> 1:19:18.960
"The moonlit nights shall return."

1:19:19.998 --> 1:19:23.680
"We'll meet again, sweetheart."

1:19:25.344 --> 1:19:29.575
"The sunlight shall
enter through the window."

1:19:30.441 --> 1:19:33.831
"Counting our blessings,
making our dreams come true..."

1:19:35.097 --> 1:19:39.937
"Counting our blessings,
making our dreams come true..."

1:19:40.374 --> 1:19:44.440
"...we'll abide by this bond."

1:19:45.512 --> 1:19:48.076
"The rain shall drench us again..."

1:19:48.156 --> 1:19:50.672
"...and the courtyard will light up."

1:19:50.752 --> 1:19:54.834
"Love shall once again be in the air."

1:19:55.714 --> 1:19:58.507
"Waking up the morning..."

1:19:58.587 --> 1:20:01.040
"...and decking yourself..."

1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:06.045
"...you can watch me."

1:20:06.125 --> 1:20:10.374
"Wait for me."

1:20:11.166 --> 1:20:13.952
"Wait for me."

1:20:14.032 --> 1:20:16.004
Nargis has seen you.

1:20:16.410 --> 1:20:19.541
She is eagerly waiting for you.

1:20:21.980 --> 1:20:24.142
Don't lose hope.

1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:29.537
God is your protector.

1:21:27.511 --> 1:21:31.802
"Wait for me."

1:21:32.462 --> 1:21:36.469
"Wait for me."

1:21:37.559 --> 1:21:42.004
"Don't lose faith."

1:21:42.759 --> 1:21:47.066
"Wait for me."

1:21:49.524 --> 1:21:54.237
9th March, the night on
which Nargis arrived in Noman.

1:21:55.924 --> 1:22:00.880
That black van was rented
from some Al Habb Travels.

1:22:13.250 --> 1:22:16.562
Four black vans were rented
by four different people.

1:22:16.642 --> 1:22:19.917
But according to this car rental's GPS...

1:22:20.168 --> 1:22:22.858
...one black van arrived
at the airport that night.

1:22:22.994 --> 1:22:23.819
Which one?

1:22:24.110 --> 1:22:25.364
Look at the screen.

1:22:32.962 --> 1:22:35.661
Client name Filly Modelling Agency.

1:22:38.822 --> 1:22:39.942
Modelling agency?

1:22:40.939 --> 1:22:42.378
How is that possible?

1:22:42.749 --> 1:22:47.058
Because that advertisement was
for job placement of some company's HR.

1:22:47.195 --> 1:22:48.060
Hang on.

1:23:08.649 --> 1:23:09.957
Itzak Regini.

1:23:10.268 --> 1:23:12.046
Hails from Algeria...

1:23:12.126 --> 1:23:15.235
...and is a successful foreign
chief modelling coordinator.

1:23:15.858 --> 1:23:18.833
And is known to work with
all the international models.

1:23:19.130 --> 1:23:21.247
But this looks very legal.

1:23:21.433 --> 1:23:25.764
Every illegal business is
done through legal channels, Sameer.

1:23:26.825 --> 1:23:30.647
If we raid the modelling agency now
and don't find this man...

1:23:30.727 --> 1:23:33.694
...then the entire gang will get alerted
and escape.

1:23:33.774 --> 1:23:36.125
And even the footage isn't clear.

1:23:36.205 --> 1:23:37.811
His face isn't visible at all.

1:23:37.891 --> 1:23:43.614
We cannot prove any charges
in the court against him right now.

1:23:43.694 --> 1:23:44.970
What do you mean?

1:23:45.856 --> 1:23:48.833
Are you going to sit idle? And do nothing.

1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:50.675
No.

1:23:51.462 --> 1:23:57.882
We'll keep an eye on Itzak Regini
until he doesn't lead os to Nargis.

1:25:18.662 --> 1:25:19.119
Hello.

1:25:19.199 --> 1:25:19.838
Faiz.

1:25:38.168 --> 1:25:42.616
[wireless crackle sound]

1:25:58.229 --> 1:26:00.592
We discovered this body two hours ago.

1:26:02.986 --> 1:26:04.336
Got an anonymous call.

1:26:11.488 --> 1:26:13.774
We also found burnt Indian passport...

1:26:14.664 --> 1:26:16.073
...for you to verify.

1:26:17.146 --> 1:26:18.633
Sorry for this to happen.

1:26:43.518 --> 1:26:44.688
Sameer.

1:26:45.127 --> 1:26:47.313
Sameer, please don't go ahead.

1:26:47.393 --> 1:26:49.887
Sameer.
Please don't go there.

1:27:14.523 --> 1:27:16.024
She is not Nargis.

1:27:17.093 --> 1:27:18.151
She is not Nargis.

1:28:09.282 --> 1:28:13.514
"From the eyes to the blessings."

1:28:17.441 --> 1:28:21.591
"From faith to karma."

1:28:25.530 --> 1:28:29.996
"From the eyes to the blessings."

1:28:30.076 --> 1:28:34.089
"From faith to karma."

1:28:34.169 --> 1:28:39.944
"From reality to illusion."

1:28:42.180 --> 1:28:46.234
"From prayers to realization."

1:28:46.314 --> 1:28:50.342
"The entire journey..."

1:28:50.422 --> 1:28:56.258
"...to the illuminated
city of the angels."

1:28:58.308 --> 1:29:02.407
"From tears to celebrations."

1:29:02.487 --> 1:29:06.299
"From one lifetime to next."

1:29:06.455 --> 1:29:14.574
"From the holy bond to the grave."

1:29:18.121 --> 1:29:26.044
"I am with you till your last step."

1:29:26.124 --> 1:29:33.080
"I am with you till your last step."

1:29:33.930 --> 1:29:40.427
"I am with you till your last step."

1:29:58.250 --> 1:30:06.303
"The dark night shall pass..."

1:30:06.383 --> 1:30:14.229
"...love shall rise again with the dawn."

1:30:14.309 --> 1:30:21.807
"A place with no tears, no pain..."

1:30:21.887 --> 1:30:29.412
"...I promise we shall meet there again."

1:30:29.492 --> 1:30:33.607
"From the pain to relief."

1:30:33.687 --> 1:30:37.498
"From separation to union."

1:30:37.578 --> 1:30:47.016
"From walking down
the aisle to the grave."

1:30:49.337 --> 1:30:57.008
"I am with you till your last step."

1:30:57.088 --> 1:31:04.143
"I am with you till your last step."

1:31:05.142 --> 1:31:11.663
"I am with you till your last step."

1:31:36.118 --> 1:31:37.505
She is in heaven.

1:31:38.356 --> 1:31:39.721
Let her go, friend.

1:31:44.890 --> 1:31:51.773
"I am with you till... your last step."

1:32:04.205 --> 1:32:07.989
This is the compensation
amount from my government.

1:32:08.069 --> 1:32:09.621
Passport and boarding pass.

1:32:13.784 --> 1:32:18.205
I can't feel your pain,
Sameer, but believe me...

1:32:19.168 --> 1:32:22.119
...the Sultanate of Noman will make sure
you get justice.

1:32:31.036 --> 1:32:32.088
Take care.

1:33:17.030 --> 1:33:17.722
Urgent.

1:33:37.607 --> 1:33:40.407
Oh, God. How is this possible?

1:33:44.897 --> 1:33:46.108
Faiz...

1:33:48.850 --> 1:33:51.072
Zaid, connect me to International Airport.

1:33:54.776 --> 1:33:55.695
Hello.

1:33:55.997 --> 1:33:59.273
Hello, this is Tamina Hamid.
Senior officer ISA.

1:33:59.353 --> 1:34:00.959
Please stop the passengers and make sure

1:34:01.039 --> 1:34:02.636
they don't board the flight to India.

1:34:02.716 --> 1:34:04.219
Stop the boarding right now.

1:34:04.299 --> 1:34:06.339
The boarding is already complete, madam.

1:34:06.419 --> 1:34:08.892
But the passenger Sameer
Choudhary is not on the list.

1:34:08.972 --> 1:34:10.988
- He's a no show officer.
- What?

1:34:11.068 --> 1:34:12.572
But that's possible.

1:34:12.652 --> 1:34:14.849
Please check again.
And stop the flight.

1:34:14.929 --> 1:34:16.661
I am afraid that's
not possible, officer...

1:34:16.741 --> 1:34:19.429
Please listen to me, you have to
do whatever possible to stop the flight.

1:34:19.509 --> 1:34:21.823
The craft is already taxing on the runway.

1:34:21.903 --> 1:34:24.645
But we're sure the passenger
you mentioned has not boarded.

1:34:24.725 --> 1:34:26.389
He's a no show passenger.

1:34:59.985 --> 1:35:01.064
Hello.

1:35:01.144 --> 1:35:02.622
Tamina Hadi, ISA.

1:35:02.702 --> 1:35:04.398
I spoke to you on the phone.
Please give me the passenger list.

1:35:22.077 --> 1:35:24.178
Sameer Chaudhary. Indian.

1:36:05.037 --> 1:36:09.617
Commander, the truth is Nargis is alive.

1:36:11.548 --> 1:36:15.647
The dead body which we found
and the details we have of Nargis...

1:36:15.727 --> 1:36:19.721
...like height etcetera, don't match.

1:36:20.437 --> 1:36:23.283
We feared that they will kill Nargis.

1:36:23.363 --> 1:36:27.547
And they proved our
fear right and mislead us.

1:36:27.627 --> 1:36:32.937
The body was so severely burnt
that facial identification was impossible.

1:36:36.271 --> 1:36:40.049
But if according to
you if Sameer doesn't know

1:36:40.129 --> 1:36:41.529
...that his wife is alive...

1:36:42.013 --> 1:36:43.198
...then why is he still in Noman.

1:36:43.278 --> 1:36:47.964
Commander is Sameer
the man he's telling us.

1:36:48.709 --> 1:36:51.857
Is Nargis even his wife?

1:36:52.293 --> 1:36:55.434
And why did Sameer
pretend to return to India?

1:36:55.898 --> 1:37:00.180
Commander, we're facing many
questions to which we don't know answers.

1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:02.029
Revenge, Commander.

1:37:02.109 --> 1:37:04.823
Sameer wants revenge from Itzak Regini.

1:37:05.625 --> 1:37:08.685
And he will try to find him at any cost.

1:37:19.898 --> 1:37:23.813
'I am a 20-year-old model arriving
in Noman tomorrow from a small holiday.'

1:37:26.658 --> 1:37:29.356
'Don't know anyone
here and saw your website.'

1:37:29.436 --> 1:37:31.302
'So I am hoping Itzak if we could meet...'

1:37:31.382 --> 1:37:33.837
'...and you could help me
get an assignment while I am here."

1:37:34.086 --> 1:37:36.447
"With Love, Roxanne from Jordan."

1:38:21.724 --> 1:38:24.263
Usman, I've found him.

1:38:25.419 --> 1:38:29.799
I must get to Sharmal
Al-Shaikh tomorrow morning.

1:38:31.883 --> 1:38:32.755
Thank you.

1:38:35.768 --> 1:38:36.637
Thank you.

1:38:40.759 --> 1:38:41.396
Hello.

1:38:47.434 --> 1:38:50.282
When will he return? Any clue?

1:38:50.991 --> 1:38:51.917
No.

1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:54.494
But he must be on his way.

1:39:00.102 --> 1:39:03.764
Wait, Usman. Wait.
Back. Go back.

1:39:14.759 --> 1:39:16.655
ISA. What are they doing here?

1:39:17.396 --> 1:39:19.486
I guess they know you didn't leave.

1:39:19.566 --> 1:39:23.077
The Immigrations are
very clever and strict too.

1:39:23.742 --> 1:39:28.431
But Sameer, only the ISA can help you.

1:39:31.374 --> 1:39:34.275
I want revenge not help.

1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:39.781
We were meant to part ways here.

1:39:39.861 --> 1:39:40.859
No.

1:39:41.104 --> 1:39:44.097
Pathan never leaves his friend in midway.

1:39:44.701 --> 1:39:47.347
I will take you to Sharmal Shaikh.

1:39:51.315 --> 1:39:53.418
Bury me next to Nargis.

1:39:56.809 --> 1:39:57.736
Promise me.

1:39:59.407 --> 1:40:00.186
What?

1:40:02.175 --> 1:40:03.204
Goodbye.

1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:08.341
Sameer.

1:40:08.566 --> 1:40:10.399
Have faith in God.

1:40:10.479 --> 1:40:13.106
Look...
Listen to me.

1:40:13.556 --> 1:40:16.082
Brother.
For God's sake stop.

1:40:16.464 --> 1:40:21.014
"We'll meet again someday..."

1:40:21.094 --> 1:40:25.165
"...until then it's goodbye."

1:40:34.616 --> 1:40:39.135
"We'll meet again someday..."

1:40:39.215 --> 1:40:43.664
"...until then it's goodbye."

1:40:43.744 --> 1:40:48.176
"The separation is only short-lived..."

1:40:48.256 --> 1:40:52.726
"...until then it's goodbye."

1:40:52.806 --> 1:40:57.223
"This moment shall pass..."

1:40:57.303 --> 1:41:01.651
"...and love shall blossom again."

1:41:01.731 --> 1:41:10.541
"And time shall bring
us to the shores again."

1:41:10.887 --> 1:41:15.298
"Remember me on that day..."

1:41:15.378 --> 1:41:19.864
"...until then it's goodbye."

1:41:19.944 --> 1:41:24.396
"The separation is only short-lived..."

1:41:24.476 --> 1:41:28.686
"...until then it's goodbye."

1:41:28.841 --> 1:41:30.848
"Goodbye."

1:41:37.750 --> 1:41:39.652
"Goodbye."

1:41:40.033 --> 1:41:42.351
"Goodbye."

1:41:43.430 --> 1:41:44.703
I need a hotel car.

1:41:45.063 --> 1:41:47.277
My wife needs to go
to town for a few hours.

1:41:48.314 --> 1:41:50.328
Please make sure he's
an English speaking driver.

1:41:50.408 --> 1:41:53.178
Okay, sir. The car will be
waiting for you at the reception.

1:41:53.258 --> 1:41:54.066
Thank you.

1:43:22.609 --> 1:43:23.630
Hello.

1:44:08.391 --> 1:44:09.364
Marvellous.

1:44:11.031 --> 1:44:11.999
Hands up.

1:44:13.209 --> 1:44:14.212
Inside.

1:44:14.883 --> 1:44:15.956
Come on.

1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:22.155
Come on.

1:44:30.371 --> 1:44:31.820
Come on.

1:45:10.884 --> 1:45:13.176
Do you want to kill me?

1:46:00.141 --> 1:46:01.811
Now, do you understand who I am?

1:46:02.131 --> 1:46:03.748
Do you understand who I am?

1:46:10.183 --> 1:46:11.318
Indian.

1:46:18.145 --> 1:46:19.564
Your wife...

1:46:20.605 --> 1:46:21.916
...is alive.

1:46:23.259 --> 1:46:27.372
Scared to see your death, you f**** liar.

1:46:39.940 --> 1:46:41.161
Cover up.

1:46:42.432 --> 1:46:43.666
What cover up?

1:47:16.355 --> 1:47:20.855
Nargis...is alive.

1:47:22.208 --> 1:47:22.900
Liar.

1:47:26.382 --> 1:47:27.467
No, no, no...

1:47:34.243 --> 1:47:36.189
Nargis is here.

1:47:37.911 --> 1:47:40.013
You were a big problem.

1:47:40.886 --> 1:47:48.066
That was just a coverup
so you go back to India.

1:47:51.053 --> 1:47:53.440
That is why we killed that girl.

1:47:57.545 --> 1:47:59.081
You have to believe me.

1:48:00.362 --> 1:48:01.642
Where is Nargis?

1:48:01.722 --> 1:48:04.798
Nargis is in the parking lot.

1:48:12.457 --> 1:48:16.383
She is going to be transported to my boss.

1:48:18.146 --> 1:48:21.658
If you don't go there fast
the ship is going to leave.

1:48:22.385 --> 1:48:25.471
If you don't believe, then go find her.

1:48:25.948 --> 1:48:28.203
Then you can come back and kill me.

1:48:29.518 --> 1:48:30.542
Sameer.

1:48:30.622 --> 1:48:32.161
- Sameer, stop.
- Brother.

1:48:32.666 --> 1:48:34.680
Sameer, Nargis is alive.

1:48:35.115 --> 1:48:36.679
She is telling the truth.

1:48:37.008 --> 1:48:40.122
We were looking for you to tell you this.

1:48:40.202 --> 1:48:42.167
Yes, they want to help you.

1:48:42.435 --> 1:48:43.210
Sameer.

1:48:44.406 --> 1:48:45.452
Put the gun down.

1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:47.482
Sameer, please.

1:48:54.512 --> 1:48:56.067
He says Nargis is alive.

1:48:56.295 --> 1:49:00.135
Okay, fine. We'll get her back.

1:49:00.215 --> 1:49:02.920
We're very close to solving the case.

1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.488
Come on, give me the gun.

1:49:07.700 --> 1:49:09.257
Yes give it.

1:49:12.654 --> 1:49:13.547
Sameer.

1:49:14.204 --> 1:49:15.650
Sameer please, trust us.

1:49:16.503 --> 1:49:17.662
Give him the gun.

1:49:18.458 --> 1:49:19.617
Give me the gun.

1:49:57.553 --> 1:49:59.006
Run, Sameer.

1:50:02.894 --> 1:50:04.464
Run, Sameer.

1:50:40.649 --> 1:50:41.874
Nargis.

1:51:16.417 --> 1:51:17.334
Nargis.

1:51:19.551 --> 1:51:20.554
Sameer.

1:51:21.501 --> 1:51:22.947
Sameer, I'm here.

1:51:32.194 --> 1:51:33.031
Nargis.

1:51:33.356 --> 1:51:34.159
Sameer.

1:51:39.189 --> 1:51:41.687
Don't make any noise. I'll be right back.

1:51:42.949 --> 1:51:45.211
Don't make any noise, sweetheart.

1:52:11.674 --> 1:52:12.353
Hello.

1:52:12.615 --> 1:52:15.431
Usman, I found Nargis.

1:52:24.384 --> 1:52:25.394
Usman.

1:52:29.802 --> 1:52:30.666
Brother.

1:52:30.888 --> 1:52:32.438
- Usman.
- Brother.

1:52:34.797 --> 1:52:35.610
Brother.

1:52:40.660 --> 1:52:41.733
Come in.

1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:40.212
This is Officer Faiz Abu Malik.

1:53:40.292 --> 1:53:43.700
It's sad to inform that
officer Tamina is dead.

1:53:44.132 --> 1:53:47.756
She's been shot and she's dead.

1:53:48.206 --> 1:53:51.129
She's been killed by
the Indian assailant Sameer.

1:53:51.209 --> 1:53:53.067
Give the news to the
Commander immediately.

1:53:53.147 --> 1:53:54.070
High Priority.

1:53:54.391 --> 1:53:57.421
The assailant escaped
in a large black trailer.

1:53:57.501 --> 1:54:00.373
I need backup immediately.
Shoot at sight.

1:56:50.820 --> 1:56:52.702
I had to kill one of my own officers.

1:56:54.552 --> 1:56:56.441
Or she would've turned a witness.

1:56:56.521 --> 1:56:58.572
Itzak fu**** blew my cover.

1:57:00.087 --> 1:57:02.813
But that other guy,
the husband is still out there.

1:57:03.354 --> 1:57:04.723
The problem still continues.

1:57:04.803 --> 1:57:06.730
You should've got the Indian girl killed.

1:57:06.810 --> 1:57:08.529
It's a big fu**** mess now.

1:57:09.878 --> 1:57:10.985
Algerians...

1:57:12.632 --> 1:57:14.929
...don't go back on their word, officer.

1:57:17.836 --> 1:57:19.766
We have discussed this before, officer.

1:57:20.803 --> 1:57:22.083
She is sold.

1:57:23.667 --> 1:57:25.528
We give you burned and dead girl.

1:57:26.655 --> 1:57:29.604
All you needed to do
was close the bloody case.

1:57:31.329 --> 1:57:33.467
Secure the problem, brother.

1:57:33.909 --> 1:57:36.273
That's why we're partners in crime.

1:58:02.324 --> 1:58:03.204
Sameer...

1:58:03.371 --> 1:58:04.245
Sir.

1:58:04.533 --> 1:58:06.770
I am going to see Commander Ghazi,
I've been called.

1:58:07.506 --> 1:58:09.936
Sameer, this matter is very complex.

1:58:10.355 --> 1:58:12.418
You're making allegations
against officer Faiz Abu Malik...

1:58:12.498 --> 1:58:15.240
...and he's blamed you
for officer Tamina's death.

1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:16.382
It's all a lie, sir.

1:58:16.462 --> 1:58:18.229
They've ordered shoot at sight for you.

1:58:18.309 --> 1:58:19.260
Do you hear me?

1:58:19.544 --> 1:58:20.679
Shoot at sight.

1:58:20.759 --> 1:58:23.978
I'm bringing other girls along
with my wife in a black trailer, sir.

1:58:24.058 --> 1:58:26.939
The gangsters involved are chasing me.

1:58:27.127 --> 1:58:31.575
Sir, please help me get
to the ISA so I can expose them.

1:58:31.949 --> 1:58:32.945
Sameer.

1:58:33.575 --> 1:58:35.187
- Sameer.
- Please...

1:58:45.757 --> 1:58:46.732
Usman.

1:58:46.975 --> 1:58:48.434
Usman, open your eyes.

2:00:29.574 --> 2:00:32.666
Vice Commander,
he's coming in to surrender.

2:00:32.935 --> 2:00:35.260
Please, give him a chance.

2:01:00.156 --> 2:01:01.272
Commander...

2:01:19.582 --> 2:01:22.813
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

2:01:22.893 --> 2:01:25.428
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

2:01:25.508 --> 2:01:28.431
My wife's in the trailer
and a man who is injured.

2:01:28.783 --> 2:01:30.070
Call Commander Ghazi.

2:01:30.150 --> 2:01:31.669
Take me to the Indian Embassy.

2:01:56.255 --> 2:01:58.841
Faiz Abu Malik has killed officer Tamina.

2:02:00.351 --> 2:02:01.950
Call the Indian Embassy.

2:02:02.178 --> 2:02:03.756
Call Commander Ghazi!

2:02:22.938 --> 2:02:24.246
You're dead.

2:02:49.537 --> 2:02:54.690
All officer stand down.
I repeat all officer stand down

2:03:44.919 --> 2:03:46.193
This is for Nargis!

2:06:53.544 --> 2:06:56.122
I will recover soon.

2:06:57.503 --> 2:07:03.408
Brother, I've a wish to see India.

2:07:04.973 --> 2:07:07.929
If God wills we will meet again.

2:07:11.211 --> 2:07:12.877
I shall wait for that day.

2:07:15.163 --> 2:07:17.754
I can never repay your favour.

2:07:17.834 --> 2:07:19.392
No, brother.

2:07:20.865 --> 2:07:27.404
What you call favour
Pathan believes it's his duty.

2:07:28.105 --> 2:07:34.719
What you feel is a courtesy,
Pathan feels it's his faith.

2:07:36.754 --> 2:07:38.941
God is your protector, brother.

2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:41.404
Goodbye.

2:07:43.936 --> 2:07:45.085
Travel safe.

2:07:46.918 --> 2:07:48.115
Be safe.

2:07:57.255 --> 2:07:59.215
Remember me in your prayers.

2:08:05.528 --> 2:08:06.486
Goodbye.

2:08:08.350 --> 2:08:09.186
Goodbye.

2:08:41.225 --> 2:08:45.108
"Since I found you..."

2:08:45.324 --> 2:08:50.738
"...I feel blessed."

2:08:50.818 --> 2:09:00.289
"Seems like I've found my refuge."

2:09:00.369 --> 2:09:04.156
"You were missing in my life..."

2:09:04.236 --> 2:09:08.924
"...but now that gap is filled."

2:09:09.792 --> 2:09:18.917
"With God's grace,
I've found what I had lost."

2:09:20.420 --> 2:09:29.962
"You became my blessing from God."

2:09:30.130 --> 2:09:39.616
"You're my dream come true."

2:09:39.696 --> 2:09:48.734
"You became my life."

2:10:08.544 --> 2:10:13.124
"We'll meet again someday..."

2:10:13.204 --> 2:10:17.284
"...until then it's goodbye."

2:10:26.697 --> 2:10:31.228
"We'll meet again someday..."

2:10:31.308 --> 2:10:35.463
"...until then it's goodbye."

2:10:35.768 --> 2:10:40.272
"The separation is only short-lived..."

2:10:40.352 --> 2:10:44.251
"...until then it's goodbye."

2:10:44.853 --> 2:10:48.783
"This moment shall pass..."

2:10:49.420 --> 2:10:53.266
"...and love shall blossom again."

2:10:53.875 --> 2:11:02.148
"And time shall bring
us to the shores again."

2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.459
"Remember me on that day..."

2:11:07.539 --> 2:11:11.983
"...until then it's goodbye."

2:11:12.063 --> 2:11:16.454
"The separation is only short-lived..."

2:11:16.534 --> 2:11:20.795
"...until then it's goodbye."

2:11:20.875 --> 2:11:22.862
"Goodbye."

2:11:29.876 --> 2:11:31.770
"Goodbye."

2:11:38.943 --> 2:11:40.811
"Goodbye."

2:11:41.456 --> 2:11:43.683
"Goodbye."

2:11:43.763 --> 2:11:45.910
"Goodbye."

2:11:46.114 --> 2:11:54.995
"You dwell in my memories all the time."

2:11:59.538 --> 2:12:08.220
"You dwell in my memories all the time."

2:12:08.300 --> 2:12:12.456
"All those moments spent with you..."

2:12:12.536 --> 2:12:17.580
"...still dwell somewhere in me."

2:12:17.660 --> 2:12:21.617
"This moment shall pass..."

2:12:22.233 --> 2:12:26.168
"...but you shall always
dwell in my heart."

2:12:26.730 --> 2:12:31.196
"Time can try as much as it wants..."

2:12:31.403 --> 2:12:35.390
"...but even time will lose."

2:12:35.771 --> 2:12:40.251
"We'll meet again someday..."

2:12:40.331 --> 2:12:44.817
"...until then it's goodbye."

2:12:44.897 --> 2:12:49.297
"The separation is only short-lived..."

2:12:49.377 --> 2:12:53.518
"...until then it's goodbye."

2:12:53.598 --> 2:12:56.113
"Goodbye."

2:13:02.703 --> 2:13:05.132
"Goodbye."

2:13:11.739 --> 2:13:14.174
"Goodbye."

2:13:20.862 --> 2:13:22.998
"Goodbye."

2:13:23.078 --> 2:13:25.161
"Goodbye."
