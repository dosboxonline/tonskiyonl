WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.628
(tranquil music playing)

00:14.931 --> 00:16.725
(indistinct chatter)

00:33.033 --> 00:35.660
I am sorry to be late.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.538
No worries. Here.
Your Opsadda.

00:38.621 --> 00:39.706
Thank you.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.303
(sighs)

00:53.970 --> 00:55.055
Everything all right?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.973
There are days when
I would rather

00:57.057 --> 00:59.642
confront a fleet of Krill
battle cruisers,

00:59.726 --> 01:01.311
than parent a child.

01:01.978 --> 01:02.979
What's going on?

01:04.689 --> 01:08.026
I believe Topa is infatuated
with a male.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.695
Oh, she's got a crush on a boy.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.906
Yes. I have questioned her,

01:12.989 --> 01:15.658
but she refuses to discuss
the details of the matter.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.827
She frequently locks
herself in her room,

01:18.161 --> 01:19.954
and does not emerge for hours.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.457
Girls can be shy about this
kind of thing, Bortus,

01:22.540 --> 01:23.875
especially with their fathers.

01:23.958 --> 01:24.959
Why?

01:25.669 --> 01:28.296
Well, it can feel
a little embarrassing at times.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.714
Or, at least very personal.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.426
Klyden was more adept
at speaking with Topa

01:33.510 --> 01:35.887
regarding personal matters.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.848
It has been difficult
now that he is gone.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.934
Maybe Topa would be
more comfortable

01:41.017 --> 01:42.310
talking with another female.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.105
Then you will speak to her.
Thank you.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.440
Wait, wait, wait, hold on!

01:48.274 --> 01:49.442
Me?

01:50.026 --> 01:53.196
Topa holds you in the
highest regard, Commander.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.615
She considers you a mentor.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.119
I'll see what I can do.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.215
(door chimes)

02:12.298 --> 02:14.009
Not now, Papa!

02:16.469 --> 02:18.513
-(door chimes)
-What?

02:21.349 --> 02:22.350
Commander Grayson.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.394
It's okay, you don't
have to get up.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.479
Can I come in?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.648
Yes, of course.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.235
I'm running a new
tactical simulation tomorrow.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.486
Atmospheric Combat.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.530
And, I thought you might like
to come along,

02:35.613 --> 02:37.240
maybe even make a jump or two.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.828
That... would be very
exciting, sir. Thank you.

02:41.911 --> 02:45.206
-Simulator two, 1800 hours.
-I will be there.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.467
You know, Topa...

02:56.676 --> 02:59.054
it's been a really
overwhelming year for you.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.390
And, you have handled it all

03:02.474 --> 03:05.435
with a poise and a hardiness

03:05.518 --> 03:08.355
that some people
twice your age wouldn't.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.941
But, I want you to know...

03:12.025 --> 03:14.069
you don't have to do it alone.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.448
You can always talk to me about
anything that's on your mind.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.451
Life... school...

03:21.534 --> 03:22.911
boys... girls...

03:30.001 --> 03:32.253
How do you know if
a boy likes you?

03:38.009 --> 03:39.094
Well...

03:40.011 --> 03:41.805
sometimes it's not
so easy to tell.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.099
Guys don't always express
their feelings.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.601
Is there someone that you like?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.061
Yes.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.188
And, have you told this person
how you feel?

03:50.271 --> 03:51.523
I have not.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.857
Why?

03:54.526 --> 03:56.736
What if he does not
like me in return?

03:56.861 --> 03:59.656
Hm. That's always
a possibility.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.117
What is it you like about him?

04:03.535 --> 04:04.994
He is funny.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.538
He is warm.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.331
We share many interests.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.668
Well, then I'd say there's
a pretty good chance

04:11.751 --> 04:13.044
he might like you back.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.588
You're a very special girl.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.342
If I were you, I'd tell
him how you feel.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.184
(tranquil music playing)

04:33.898 --> 04:36.443
My mom's like, "Why don't you
get him a job on the Orville?"

04:36.526 --> 04:39.195
And I'm like, "Why should I
go out on a limb for this guy

04:39.320 --> 04:40.947
just because you dropped
the ball when we were kids?"

04:41.031 --> 04:42.407
I mean, he is your brother.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.117
LT. GORDON MALLOY: Yeah, but
he's a drunken screw-up.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.577
And I don't wanna put my ass
on the line

04:45.660 --> 04:47.245
if he's gonna make me
look like a schmuck.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.455
Oh, hey, Topa.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.874
Oh, hey, Topa, how are ya?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.292
Good. How are you?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.127
No complaints.
What's goin' on?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.713
I would like to...

04:56.796 --> 05:00.133
I would like to ask
you if perhaps

05:00.216 --> 05:02.052
we could eat a meal together.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.057
Sometime.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.018
Oh, sure. What's up?
You need advice on something?

05:10.643 --> 05:12.479
No. I...

05:13.229 --> 05:14.606
Is everything okay?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.400
I think of you often.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.693
I like you.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.028
Well, I like you too.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.073
-You do?
-Sure, why wouldn't I?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.492
TOPA: I enjoy spending
time with you.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.202
You are a male, and
yet you possess

05:27.285 --> 05:28.870
many prominent female traits,

05:28.953 --> 05:30.205
which I find appealing.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.331
Oh.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.709
Could we... have dinner?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.755
-Ohhhhh.
-Yeah, there ya go, Sherlock.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.592
You know, um...

05:42.676 --> 05:45.512
Topa, I think you're
an amazing person.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.763
And, um...

05:47.097 --> 05:49.432
You're like... you're like
the little sister I never had.

05:50.809 --> 05:51.726
Sister?

05:51.810 --> 05:54.187
Yeah. Like family.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.107
I'm always here for you,
and if you ever have a problem,

05:57.190 --> 05:58.942
or something doesn't
go your way,

05:59.025 --> 06:01.277
you know that I'll always
have your back.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.029
Thank you.

06:03.154 --> 06:06.866
I... should go now
or I will be late for school.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.369
Good, good.
No, school's important.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.204
Learn-- Learn a lot!

06:15.375 --> 06:18.420
Hey, you know she's
way too mature for you, right?

06:18.503 --> 06:19.963
Not listening, not laughing.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.297
I think it's cute.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.133
You're an attractive
guy, she sees it.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.260
End of conversation, later.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.972
He's attractive, right?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.476
Eh, looks better goin'
than comin'.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.812
<i>It's been almost a year</i>
<i>since the Union</i>

06:35.895 --> 06:37.731
<i>granted protective</i>
<i>status to Heveena,</i>

06:37.814 --> 06:39.733
<i>and her colony of</i>
<i>Moclan refugees.</i>

06:39.858 --> 06:41.026
<i>Per the agreement,</i>

06:41.151 --> 06:42.944
<i>the Union Council</i>
<i>and the Moclan government</i>

06:43.028 --> 06:44.821
<i>are each entitled to conduct</i>

06:44.946 --> 06:46.740
<i>an annual inspection</i>
<i>of the colony,</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:49.826
<i>to make sure both sides</i>
<i>are abiding by its terms.</i>

06:49.909 --> 06:51.453
<i>Due to the Orville's history</i>

06:51.536 --> 06:53.288
<i>and familiarity</i>
<i>with the colony,</i>

06:53.371 --> 06:55.999
<i>I've assigned Commanders</i>
<i>Grayson and Bortus</i>

06:56.082 --> 06:57.459
<i>to represent the Union.</i>

06:57.542 --> 06:59.002
What are we looking for exactly?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.671
<i>Any sign of interference</i>
<i>from the Moclan authorities--</i>

07:01.755 --> 07:03.923
<i>threats, harassment,</i>
<i>surveillance,</i>

07:04.007 --> 07:06.259
<i>any act of aggression,</i>
<i>no matter how small,</i>

07:06.343 --> 07:07.886
<i>that would violate</i>
<i>the agreement.</i>

07:07.969 --> 07:11.473
And, if I may ask,
who are the Moclans sending?

07:11.556 --> 07:12.974
<i>Their inspection</i>
<i>team will be led</i>

07:13.058 --> 07:14.976
<i>by a high-ranking intelligence</i>
<i>officer,</i>

07:15.060 --> 07:16.311
<i>Commander Kodon.</i>

07:16.394 --> 07:18.396
<i>Keep in mind they still</i>
<i>regard Heveena</i>

07:18.480 --> 07:19.939
<i>with a great deal of suspicion.</i>

07:20.065 --> 07:21.399
<i>They'll be looking</i>
<i>for any indication</i>

07:21.483 --> 07:22.776
<i>that she's broken her word</i>

07:22.901 --> 07:25.653
<i>to stop smuggling</i>
<i>newborn females off Moclus.</i>

07:25.779 --> 07:27.322
When are we expected?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.740
<i>In two days. You'll</i>
<i>take a shuttle,</i>

07:28.823 --> 07:30.575
<i>which will rendezvous with</i>
<i>one of their shuttles</i>

07:30.658 --> 07:31.659
<i>in orbit of the colony.</i>

07:31.743 --> 07:33.078
Understood.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.372
<i>Captain, you're aware</i>
<i>of the tension that exists</i>

07:35.455 --> 07:38.208
<i>between Moclus and the</i>
<i>rest of the Union right now.</i>

07:38.291 --> 07:41.336
<i>They're our strongest ally</i>
<i>against the Kaylon threat,</i>

07:41.419 --> 07:43.588
<i>so, we can't afford</i>
<i>to do anything</i>

07:43.672 --> 07:45.799
<i>that might make things worse.</i>

07:45.882 --> 07:47.550
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:49.511
We'll be very careful, sir.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.389
<i>Report back as soon as you've</i>
<i>completed your inspection.</i>

07:52.472 --> 07:53.807
<i>Halsey out.</i>

08:08.279 --> 08:10.323
You know this is
a diplomatic mission, right?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.867
The Moclans will no doubt
bring weapons.

08:12.951 --> 08:16.329
I've reviewed the inspection
protocols. Sidearms only.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.748
Papa, is it true?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.333
Are you going to visit
the sanctuary

08:20.417 --> 08:21.459
where Heveena lives?

08:21.543 --> 08:22.544
Yes.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.170
May I please go with you?

08:24.254 --> 08:25.505
I would love to meet her.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.383
Commander Grayson and I

08:28.466 --> 08:30.510
have important duties
to perform.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.220
It would not be appropriate.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.097
Please, Papa.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.142
Topa...

08:37.392 --> 08:41.980
there will be Moclans present
who are hostile to all females.

08:42.105 --> 08:45.191
I would not subject you
to their ignorance and ridicule.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.736
You know, Bortus, she's
never had a chance

08:47.819 --> 08:49.738
to meet any other
Moclan females.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.990
This could be a life-altering
experience for her.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.950
I... do not know.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.869
We'll look after her.
She'll be fine.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.537
You do not need to
look after me.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.873
I can take care of myself.

09:00.957 --> 09:05.253
If the captain approves,
you may join us.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.172
Thank you, Papa!

09:07.255 --> 09:08.757
I love you!

09:09.883 --> 09:11.718
But, you must be on
your best behavior,

09:11.801 --> 09:13.762
and follow my instructions.

09:13.845 --> 09:14.971
I will!

09:15.722 --> 09:17.766
I am going to go pack!

09:23.605 --> 09:24.647
(sighs)

09:28.693 --> 09:30.695
(theme song playing)

11:02.495 --> 11:05.081
(dramatic music playing)

11:17.385 --> 11:19.346
It is so beautiful.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.349
Scans show the Moclan shuttle
on the surface.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.517
They were supposed to
meet us in orbit.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.064
Remain here for the moment.

12:23.827 --> 12:24.911
Commander Kodon.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.579
That is correct.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.747
I'm Commander Kelly Grayson,

12:27.831 --> 12:29.374
and this is Lieutenant
Commander Bortus.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.583
It was my understanding

12:30.959 --> 12:33.128
that we were conducting
this inspection together.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.714
We arrived earlier
than expected.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.257
Rather than waste time,

12:37.340 --> 12:39.801
we decided to proceed
with our survey.

12:39.884 --> 12:43.513
It appears the colonists are in
compliance with the agreement.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.890
You may begin your inspection.

12:45.974 --> 12:49.019
Well, thank you
so much for your permission.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.437
Have a safe trip home.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.147
COMMANDER KODON:
We will remain here,

12:52.230 --> 12:55.608
to ensure the Union
does not violate the agreement.

12:56.985 --> 12:57.986
Fine.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.487
But, stay out of our way.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.905
Who is this?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.786
My daughter.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.164
No new females are permitted
in the colony!

13:09.247 --> 13:10.331
It is a violation!

13:10.415 --> 13:12.167
She is an observer.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.586
She will return to the
Orville with us.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.547
The agreement allows females
to be part of the survey team.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.549
It doesn't specify the species.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.302
Disgusting creature.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.055
Bortus.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.266
Let's go.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.037
(children laughing)

14:02.008 --> 14:04.177
(speaking Moclan language)

14:14.854 --> 14:17.732
Commander Grayson, Bortus,

14:17.857 --> 14:19.776
we are pleased you have
finally arrived!

14:19.901 --> 14:21.778
Osaia. It's good to see you.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.656
I hope Commander Kodon
behaved himself in our absence.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.784
It is wise to behave oneself
when one is outnumbered.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.035
He did so.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.746
And, this must be Topa.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.039
Hello.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.958
It is a pleasure to meet you.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.669
Come. Heveena is
waiting for you.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.375
(Dolly Parton singing
"9 to 5" on speaker)

15:17.459 --> 15:21.212
Heveena. Our visitors from the
Union have arrived.

15:21.921 --> 15:22.839
(Heveena gasps)

15:22.964 --> 15:23.965
Heveena.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.967
Commander Grayson.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.510
It's so good to see you again.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.137
You too.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.389
Commander Bortus.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.932
Welcome.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.477
Please forgive me. (laughs)

15:35.560 --> 15:40.523
The voice of Dolly Parton
inspires me while I am writing.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.691
(laughs)

15:41.816 --> 15:43.651
-(sighs)
-(music stops)

15:43.735 --> 15:46.613
What a joy it is to see
your faces again.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.989
You seem well.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.910
Ah, all things considered,
we have no complaints.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.455
Our community is healthy
and safe.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.834
This is my daughter, Topa.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.838
I have read every one
of your books.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.341
My favorite is
<i>Mountain of Solitude.</i>

16:06.424 --> 16:08.426
It is an honor to be
in your presence.

16:08.510 --> 16:12.222
I promise you, Topa,
the honor is mine.

16:12.889 --> 16:16.351
Your story is an inspiration
to all.

16:16.434 --> 16:20.021
You soldiered through the storm
of a repressive system

16:20.105 --> 16:21.981
that smothered your identity...

16:22.691 --> 16:24.609
and emerged into the sunlight

16:24.693 --> 16:26.945
as the woman you were
meant to be.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.698
I have seen you in simulations,
but...

16:29.781 --> 16:32.033
I always wanted to meet
you in person.

16:32.158 --> 16:36.371
Well, I hope the real me
won't disappoint you.

16:37.205 --> 16:40.458
You have chosen a fine
time to arrive.

16:40.542 --> 16:43.461
Tonight, there will be
a double full moon,

16:43.545 --> 16:46.047
which means the luminites
will be swarming.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.549
Luminites?

16:47.632 --> 16:49.676
After your survey is complete,

16:49.759 --> 16:52.262
please join us for
the evening meal.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.180
And you can see them
for yourselves.

16:55.265 --> 16:56.433
Can we, Papa?

16:57.976 --> 16:59.227
We look forward to it.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.814
With your permission,
we'd like to tour the grounds,

17:02.939 --> 17:05.400
run some scans,
speak to some of the colonists.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.736
Our community is open to you.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.863
And, if Topa wishes,

17:09.946 --> 17:12.824
she is welcome
to spend the afternoon with me.

17:12.907 --> 17:15.326
I am sure we have much
to talk about.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.328
That is most generous.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.663
We'll see you soon.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.790
Yes, Commander.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.208
Osaia, please.

17:23.626 --> 17:27.672
Come. Join me in
my writing nook.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.467
I imagine you have
many questions.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.560
That is... Dolly Parton.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.853
HEVEENA: Yes.

17:41.936 --> 17:45.648
Your captain opened my eyes
to her greatness.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.567
She is a visionary.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.821
Everyone in this colony derives
strength from her example.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.575
I learned of her from
your newest book.

17:55.784 --> 17:56.659
Ah.

17:57.077 --> 18:00.997
We think of her
as the voice of the revolution.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.668
I want to know everything
about your revolution.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.587
<i>Our </i>revolution.
(slight chuckle)

18:08.797 --> 18:11.174
And, I'm pleased to hear that.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.218
I would also...

18:13.968 --> 18:15.428
like to thank you.

18:15.970 --> 18:16.930
For what?

18:17.472 --> 18:20.058
For speaking on my behalf
at the tribunal,

18:20.141 --> 18:22.644
when I was too young
to have a voice of my own.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.104
Ah.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.023
Your gratitude is misplaced.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.067
I failed you.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.236
No.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.238
It just...

18:33.905 --> 18:35.990
took a little longer.

18:36.408 --> 18:37.325
(slight chuckle)

18:38.868 --> 18:42.747
(soulful Moclan music playing)

19:16.364 --> 19:19.325
Those are our visitors
from the Orville.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.248
So, what do you think so far?

19:25.331 --> 19:28.001
It is even more wonderful
than I imagined.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.711
Can we stay longer?

19:29.794 --> 19:32.672
The Orville is expecting us
in the morning.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.134
But...

19:36.217 --> 19:38.762
we will return someday.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.515
Anyone seen our cheery
counterparts?

19:42.599 --> 19:45.352
I believe they returned
to their shuttle this afternoon.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.854
Well, that's some good news.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.314
Could you pass the hot sauce?

19:49.397 --> 19:51.316
You have the palate of a Moclan.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.360
(chuckles) Side effect
of hanging with this guy.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.695
Are you... mates?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.198
What?

19:58.281 --> 20:01.493
No, um, Bortus and I are
just friends. Colleagues.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.329
We work together.

20:15.090 --> 20:19.302
Papa, I want to go watch
the luminites.

20:23.473 --> 20:24.474
Very well.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.371
They're quite beautiful,
aren't they?

21:30.915 --> 21:33.376
Yes, very.

21:34.044 --> 21:38.214
They are red, yellow,
green, pink,

21:38.298 --> 21:40.467
orange, and white.

21:40.550 --> 21:45.138
And, every now and then,
you will see a blue one.

21:45.889 --> 21:48.933
They are extremely rare,

21:49.559 --> 21:52.771
but they bring very
good fortune.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.526
Here.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.531
What is it?

22:03.615 --> 22:06.409
A gift for you.

22:07.035 --> 22:09.704
We collect lava stones
from the beaches.

22:09.788 --> 22:12.540
Over thousands of years,

22:12.624 --> 22:16.336
the ocean waves polish
them smooth.

22:16.920 --> 22:22.050
A clash of fire and
water, given time,

22:22.133 --> 22:26.554
can produce great beauty.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.976
(indistinct conversation)

22:38.817 --> 22:41.903
You said that you wanted
to know more

22:41.986 --> 22:44.948
about the story of
our revolution.

22:45.907 --> 22:48.076
What if I told you...

22:48.159 --> 22:50.120
that you could play

22:50.203 --> 22:54.374
a very important role
in that story?

22:55.333 --> 22:56.793
What do you mean?

22:57.836 --> 23:00.672
Like the blue luminite,

23:00.755 --> 23:04.426
you are also extremely
rare, Topa.

23:05.218 --> 23:08.888
And, you are
in a very unique position

23:08.972 --> 23:11.182
to help our cause.

23:11.558 --> 23:12.600
How?

23:13.601 --> 23:17.522
What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.983
You cannot tell your father,

23:20.066 --> 23:23.820
or Commander Grayson,
or anyone else.

23:23.903 --> 23:29.075
If that makes you uncomfortable,
I understand.

23:29.159 --> 23:33.997
We will say goodnight now
and always remain friends.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.958
I want to help.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.252
I will tell no one.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.255
What is it?

23:43.715 --> 23:47.177
We have reestablished
our underground network

23:47.260 --> 23:50.263
to rescue female infants
from Moclus,

23:50.347 --> 23:52.891
and bring them here to safety.

23:52.974 --> 23:56.811
But... does that not violate
the agreement?

23:57.145 --> 23:58.897
It does.

23:58.980 --> 24:02.734
But... if Moclus found out...

24:02.817 --> 24:05.070
They would destroy this colony.

24:05.153 --> 24:08.365
Which is why our efforts here
and on Moclus

24:08.448 --> 24:10.575
must be tightly coordinated.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.703
We have no reliable way
of communicating

24:13.787 --> 24:15.580
outside the nebula,

24:15.663 --> 24:20.251
so all contact from those
wishing to flee Moclus

24:20.335 --> 24:22.629
is being done by messengers.

24:22.712 --> 24:25.882
It is slow and very inefficient.

24:26.716 --> 24:30.428
If we had access to
a Union starship,

24:30.512 --> 24:34.057
one with an advanced
communications array...

24:36.101 --> 24:39.187
we could save so many
more females,

24:39.270 --> 24:40.897
with greater speed.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.067
But, we would need
someone on board,

24:44.150 --> 24:46.903
who is loyal to our cause.

24:47.821 --> 24:50.323
Someone like you, Topa.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.618
What would I have to do?

24:53.702 --> 24:55.453
It is very simple.

24:55.537 --> 24:59.749
From time to time, you will
receive an encrypted message.

24:59.833 --> 25:04.337
You will relay that message
to our contact on Moclus.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.007
These messages will
be transmitted

25:07.090 --> 25:08.758
on quantum frequencies

25:08.842 --> 25:12.929
known only to you
and the others involved.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.474
You would be protecting
the lives

25:16.558 --> 25:20.770
of countless innocent females,
helpless infants,

25:20.854 --> 25:22.939
as you once were.

25:23.023 --> 25:26.401
Their story is your story.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.738
I will help.

25:31.448 --> 25:37.454
History will remember you
as a hero to your people.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.623
Who must I contact?

25:40.707 --> 25:43.877
(cheery Moclan music playing)

25:43.960 --> 25:47.505
(indistinct conversation)

25:50.633 --> 25:53.553
I have never believed in fate,

25:53.636 --> 25:58.058
but I do believe we can forge
a common destiny.

25:58.683 --> 26:03.355
Together we will accomplish
great things.

26:04.439 --> 26:06.358
I will not disappoint you.

26:08.193 --> 26:09.569
Thank you.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.994
(buzzing)

27:48.793 --> 27:50.920
(branch crackles)

28:07.854 --> 28:09.522
(branch crackles)

28:30.627 --> 28:34.047
-(ominous music playing)
-(birds screeching)

28:36.049 --> 28:39.886
(Topa screaming)

28:39.969 --> 28:41.054
Let me go!

28:41.137 --> 28:43.807
(screaming)

28:43.890 --> 28:45.475
Let me go!

28:45.558 --> 28:47.477
No!

28:51.981 --> 28:53.274
It is done.

29:00.407 --> 29:02.701
(electronic whirring)

29:02.784 --> 29:05.078
(energy pulsing)

29:17.757 --> 29:20.885
HEVEENA: The book is
fictionalized account

29:20.969 --> 29:23.471
of the rise of Beldus,

29:23.555 --> 29:28.184
the ruler of the Movav continent
in the Seventh Age.

29:28.268 --> 29:30.270
The characters are my own,

29:30.353 --> 29:33.023
but the historical
events are real.

29:33.106 --> 29:35.358
It sounds very interesting.

29:35.442 --> 29:36.443
Mm.

29:36.943 --> 29:39.404
Well, honestly, I can listen
to your stories all night,

29:39.487 --> 29:41.740
but, we should probably
get back to the Orville.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.617
Oh, of course. I understand.

29:47.996 --> 29:50.707
Where is Topa?

29:51.332 --> 29:55.045
Well, she was just...
watching the luminites.

29:57.130 --> 30:00.175
Perhaps she returned
to my writing nook.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.223
MOCLAN:
No, nothing yet.

30:07.307 --> 30:08.558
COMMANDER KELLY GRAYSON:
Anything?

30:08.641 --> 30:11.561
No. I have walked the
entire perimeter,

30:11.644 --> 30:13.271
and checked the main hall.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.065
Could she have wandered off
into the jungle?

30:15.148 --> 30:16.483
She knows better than
to venture off

30:16.566 --> 30:18.526
on her own in a strange place.

30:19.277 --> 30:23.073
(searchers shouting "Topa!")

30:30.747 --> 30:31.831
Topa!

30:32.624 --> 30:33.708
Topa!

30:45.804 --> 30:46.763
Bortus!

30:50.767 --> 30:52.143
Topa was wearing this.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.192
(dramatic music rising)

30:59.317 --> 31:02.696
We have searched everywhere.
Topa is no longer on the island.

31:02.779 --> 31:05.782
The Moclan shuttle is gone.
They must have taken her.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.076
-Why would they take Topa?
-I do not know.

31:08.159 --> 31:09.577
There can be no other
explanation.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.830
KELLY: Heveena, you were
the last one to see her.

31:11.913 --> 31:14.332
Did she say anything at all
that might give us some answers?

31:15.291 --> 31:16.918
Not that I can remember.

31:17.002 --> 31:19.170
Um... We talked.

31:19.254 --> 31:21.756
I gave her the necklace...

31:22.340 --> 31:23.383
That was it.

31:23.466 --> 31:25.552
We need to contact the Orville.

31:25.635 --> 31:27.846
(intense music playing)

31:39.983 --> 31:41.443
(electronics chirping)

31:41.526 --> 31:44.154
What the hell...
Launch thrusters won't power up.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.239
Someone has severed the
plasma injectors.

31:46.364 --> 31:48.241
And, the communications array
has been disabled.

31:48.366 --> 31:49.284
Son of a bitch.

31:49.576 --> 31:50.952
I'm gonna reconfigure
the launch controls

31:51.036 --> 31:52.287
to take off using
the main engine.

31:52.370 --> 31:53.621
This could be a little rough.

31:54.247 --> 31:55.874
(energy pulsing)

32:28.698 --> 32:30.367
The array has been depolarized.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.494
It will take several days
to repair the damage.

32:32.577 --> 32:34.329
Topa may not have several days.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.796
I'm tracking the ion trail
from the Moclan shuttle.

32:42.879 --> 32:45.965
It's dispersing fast, but
there's still enough to follow.

32:46.049 --> 32:47.425
We've got a choice:

32:48.051 --> 32:51.429
head back to the Orville,
or try to find Topa ourselves.

32:53.682 --> 32:54.724
All right.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.142
Let's do it.

32:57.852 --> 32:59.562
(dramatic music playing)

33:16.371 --> 33:18.039
Where are you taking me?

33:19.499 --> 33:21.001
Why am I here?

33:21.751 --> 33:23.336
I don't understand.

33:25.672 --> 33:27.841
My father will be worried.

33:27.924 --> 33:30.385
Please let me contact him.

33:30.468 --> 33:33.263
Do females always
talk this much?

33:33.346 --> 33:36.349
You have no right
to keep me here.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.727
I have done nothing wrong.

33:38.810 --> 33:41.438
Listen to her mighty roar!

33:42.689 --> 33:46.192
Shall we let her go
before she grows truly angry?

33:46.276 --> 33:48.528
I want to talk to my father.

33:49.571 --> 33:50.864
I want to go home.

33:50.947 --> 33:52.866
(mocking): "I want to go home!"

33:54.409 --> 33:56.119
Tell me, little worm,

33:56.202 --> 33:59.122
were you this impotent before
they cut off your kla'fash?

34:03.793 --> 34:08.173
Speak again and the next thing
you lose will be your tongue.

34:17.682 --> 34:19.684
(epic music playing)

34:27.400 --> 34:28.568
Any word?

34:28.860 --> 34:30.653
We've hailed the shuttle on
multiple frequencies, sir.

34:30.737 --> 34:31.738
No response.

34:31.946 --> 34:33.782
Could the nebula be deflecting
our signals?

34:33.907 --> 34:37.035
ISAAC: <i>I have compensated for</i>
<i>all sources of interference.</i>

34:38.161 --> 34:41.289
Charly, set a course
for the colony.

34:44.334 --> 34:45.377
Sir, if we go in there,

34:45.460 --> 34:47.003
we'll be violating
the agreement.

34:47.087 --> 34:48.880
I'm aware of that, Ensign.

34:49.464 --> 34:50.757
Lay in the course.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.008
Aye, sir.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.038
Do you have any idea where

35:22.122 --> 35:24.290
they might have taken
Topa, and why?

35:25.458 --> 35:27.168
I wish I could tell
you, Captain.

35:27.252 --> 35:30.588
Did they say or do anything
suspicious

35:30.672 --> 35:32.382
before Kelly and Bortus arrived?

35:32.465 --> 35:35.844
Other than act extremely
rude, no.

35:35.927 --> 35:37.887
I'd like permission
to take a security team

35:37.971 --> 35:39.556
down to the colony
to investigate.

35:39.639 --> 35:41.599
We should also run some
DNA scans on that necklace,

35:41.683 --> 35:43.393
see if we can find out
exactly who took her.

35:43.476 --> 35:45.687
Do it. And keep trying to raise
Kelly and Bortus.

35:45.770 --> 35:46.938
Aye, sir.

35:57.949 --> 36:00.326
As captain of this ship,

36:01.453 --> 36:03.580
it's my responsibility
to know about

36:03.663 --> 36:05.623
everything that happens
on board.

36:06.583 --> 36:09.252
It's a rare day when something
unexpected occurs,

36:09.336 --> 36:12.047
and I don't have a clue
to the reason...

36:12.130 --> 36:14.382
especially when it concerns
the safety

36:14.466 --> 36:17.052
of my crew and their families.

36:17.135 --> 36:18.928
As the leader of your colony,

36:19.012 --> 36:21.264
I would expect that you
feel the same way.

36:22.390 --> 36:23.600
Of course.

36:24.184 --> 36:27.103
So, you can understand
why I find it

36:27.187 --> 36:29.564
just a little hard to believe

36:29.647 --> 36:33.318
that you have no inkling
about what happened to Topa.

36:34.277 --> 36:37.155
No theory, no suspicion?

36:37.280 --> 36:39.115
Not even a guess?

36:39.407 --> 36:40.617
(sighs)

36:42.494 --> 36:44.287
If we have any hope
of finding her,

36:44.371 --> 36:46.414
we need to understand
why she was taken.

36:46.498 --> 36:51.711
Now, I could be wrong, Heveena,
but I think you're holding back.

36:51.795 --> 36:53.755
And, if I'm right,
I need to know,

36:53.838 --> 36:56.424
because Topa's life
may depend on it.

36:58.802 --> 37:02.430
There is more than one life
at stake here, Captain.

37:03.223 --> 37:06.393
Thousands of lives hang
in the balance.

37:06.476 --> 37:07.936
What do you mean?

37:09.521 --> 37:10.772
(sighs)

37:12.107 --> 37:15.193
I violated the terms
of the agreement.

37:15.694 --> 37:20.865
Newborn females are once again
being relocated from Moclus.

37:20.949 --> 37:25.912
I asked Topa to help
in our efforts, and she agreed.

37:25.995 --> 37:27.247
Help how?

37:27.455 --> 37:31.876
By acting as a link within
our communications network.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.838
I shared critical information
with her.

37:35.630 --> 37:38.800
Somehow, Commander Kodon
must have discovered this,

37:38.883 --> 37:40.677
and taken her for questioning.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.013
What exactly does Topa know?

37:43.096 --> 37:46.391
The name of our primary contact
on Moclus,

37:46.474 --> 37:50.395
and the quantum frequencies
that we use to encrypt messages.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.606
(sighs)

38:00.363 --> 38:01.990
What the hell were you thinking?

38:02.115 --> 38:03.533
I beg your pardon?

38:03.658 --> 38:05.910
How could you put her
in that position? She's a child!

38:07.579 --> 38:11.166
She is also a victim
of Moclan bigotry!

38:11.249 --> 38:13.501
I gave Topa the opportunity

38:13.585 --> 38:17.172
to protect her own
life as a female,

38:17.255 --> 38:19.716
and to protect
the lives of all the others!

38:19.799 --> 38:20.884
It was her choice!

38:20.967 --> 38:22.385
Oh, Jesus Christ, Heveena,

38:22.469 --> 38:24.054
what the hell did you
expect her to say?!

38:24.137 --> 38:25.138
She worships you!

38:25.221 --> 38:26.389
She would do anything
to please you,

38:26.473 --> 38:27.640
of course she's gonna say yes!

38:27.849 --> 38:30.977
I am as concerned about Topa
as you are, Captain!

38:31.061 --> 38:33.980
But, I do not regret
enlisting her help.

38:34.105 --> 38:39.027
Our struggle for equality
has always demanded risk,

38:39.110 --> 38:42.072
and, if necessary, sacrifice!

38:43.406 --> 38:46.826
I respect your struggle.
I really do.

38:46.910 --> 38:50.246
But, don't advertise tactical
opportunism as pious morality,

38:50.330 --> 38:52.040
because that's when you lose me.

38:54.084 --> 38:56.211
-(comscanner chirps)
-Mercer to bridge.

38:56.294 --> 38:57.921
Get me Admiral Halsey.

39:03.843 --> 39:05.887
(contemplative music playing)

39:12.227 --> 39:14.521
<i>The Moclan government is</i>
<i>denying any knowledge of</i>

39:14.604 --> 39:16.272
<i>Topa's abduction</i>
<i>or her whereabouts.</i>

39:16.398 --> 39:18.149
We found traces of her blood
on the necklace,

39:18.233 --> 39:19.859
along with DNA from
a Moclan male,

39:19.984 --> 39:21.569
and it didn't come from
Commander Bortus,

39:21.653 --> 39:22.821
or anyone in the colony.

39:22.904 --> 39:24.489
<i>I'm afraid that's all</i>
<i>circumstantial.</i>

39:24.614 --> 39:26.116
I'd like to question
Commander Kodon

39:26.199 --> 39:27.283
and his inspection team,

39:27.367 --> 39:29.160
and take samples of their DNA.

39:29.244 --> 39:31.913
<i>You know we can't do that</i>
<i>without probable cause.</i>

39:31.996 --> 39:34.207
<i>We're on shaky ground</i>
<i>with their government as it is.</i>

39:34.290 --> 39:35.834
Yeah, you know, it seems
like we're always

39:35.917 --> 39:38.169
on shaky ground with them,
doesn't it?

39:38.253 --> 39:41.297
Always bending over backwards
to accommodate their bullshit.

39:41.381 --> 39:42.882
<i>Mind your tone, Captain.</i>

39:42.966 --> 39:45.218
I'm sorry, sir.

39:46.177 --> 39:47.262
What do you suggest?

39:47.345 --> 39:49.139
<i>The best option is for Heveena</i>

39:49.222 --> 39:51.433
<i>to testify before the</i>
<i>Union Council.</i>

39:51.516 --> 39:52.767
<i>She would have to admit</i>

39:52.851 --> 39:54.728
<i>she's been violating</i>
<i>the agreement,</i>

39:54.811 --> 39:56.646
<i>and that she enlisted</i>
<i>Topa to help them</i>

39:56.730 --> 39:59.232
<i>continue their illegal</i>
<i>operations.</i>

39:59.357 --> 40:00.984
<i>That would demonstrate</i>
<i>a clear motive</i>

40:01.067 --> 40:02.652
<i>for the Moclans to abduct Topa,</i>

40:02.777 --> 40:05.488
<i>and we'd have cause to launch</i>
<i>a formal investigation</i>

40:05.613 --> 40:08.074
<i>with all the power</i>
<i>of Union law behind us.</i>

40:08.199 --> 40:11.369
If I do as you ask,

40:11.453 --> 40:14.664
the Moclan government
would not hesitate

40:14.748 --> 40:18.001
to invade our colony
and arrest everyone in it.

40:18.084 --> 40:21.087
<i>We would do everything possible</i>
<i>to prevent that from happening.</i>

40:21.171 --> 40:24.299
I'm very sorry, Admiral.

40:24.382 --> 40:27.052
But my answer is no.

40:27.135 --> 40:28.011
Heveena--

40:28.261 --> 40:29.763
You will not change
my mind, Captain.

40:31.014 --> 40:34.726
And, if you do take this matter
before the Council,

40:34.809 --> 40:37.437
I will deny everything.

40:39.814 --> 40:41.524
<i>It goes without saying</i>
<i>that I am</i>

40:41.608 --> 40:43.860
<i>profoundly disappointed</i>
<i>in your decision.</i>

40:43.985 --> 40:46.363
<i>I'll continue to work</i>
<i>the diplomatic channels.</i>

40:46.488 --> 40:48.406
<i>If you hear from</i>
<i>Commander Grayson,</i>

40:48.490 --> 40:49.824
<i>let me know immediately.</i>

40:49.949 --> 40:51.493
Yes, sir.

40:56.539 --> 40:58.541
(contemplative music playing)

41:10.637 --> 41:12.514
I'd like you to stay
on board the Orville,

41:12.597 --> 41:15.350
until Commander Keyali
completes her investigation.

41:16.226 --> 41:18.103
In case we have any
more questions.

41:18.186 --> 41:20.897
If you insist.

41:30.657 --> 41:31.783
(sighs)

41:38.331 --> 41:40.333
(dramatic music playing)

41:43.670 --> 41:45.588
The ion trail is dissipating.

41:45.672 --> 41:48.258
I am extrapolating
their trajectory.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.721
They appear to be on course
for the Zonari System,

41:52.804 --> 41:53.888
six light-years away.

41:53.972 --> 41:55.098
According to the database,

41:55.181 --> 41:57.142
there is only one planet
in that system.

41:57.225 --> 41:58.226
Uninhabited.

41:58.309 --> 41:59.853
Then, that's where we're headed.

42:27.756 --> 42:28.923
(door chimes)

42:30.050 --> 42:31.217
Yes?

42:37.265 --> 42:38.683
Commander.

42:39.351 --> 42:41.269
What can I do for you?

42:41.353 --> 42:44.314
The Captain has asked me
to escort you to Simulator One.

42:45.231 --> 42:47.025
For what reason?

42:47.150 --> 42:49.235
There's someone he
wants you to meet.

43:09.130 --> 43:11.341
If you need anything,
I'll be right outside.

43:38.118 --> 43:40.704
What is this place?

43:43.540 --> 43:46.334
Oh, there you are! Welcome!

43:46.418 --> 43:48.753
Come on in, don't be shy.

43:48.837 --> 43:50.130
By the gods!

43:50.213 --> 43:52.882
Oh, come on, don't
you bow to me.

43:52.966 --> 43:54.551
I'm not all that.

43:54.634 --> 43:56.553
I'm not even sure I'm all there.

43:58.054 --> 44:01.850
I am so glad to finally
meet you, Heveena.

44:01.933 --> 44:04.269
I have heard
so many good things about you.

44:04.352 --> 44:06.896
No. You are not real.

44:07.022 --> 44:08.857
This is an illusion.

44:08.982 --> 44:11.943
And, I know what Captain Mercer
is trying to do.

44:12.068 --> 44:13.695
Well, I have been programmed

44:13.778 --> 44:16.781
from a whole mess of
historical records and data.

44:16.865 --> 44:20.452
And, I might not be real,
but I'm still all Dolly.

44:20.535 --> 44:21.453
(slight chuckle)

44:22.662 --> 44:25.498
Oh, come on, sit,
take a load off.

44:26.624 --> 44:29.711
I have been hearing
that you have just got

44:29.794 --> 44:32.380
the weight of the world
on your shoulders, girl.

44:32.464 --> 44:33.757
You wanna talk about it?

44:33.840 --> 44:37.385
Because they tell me
that I'm a pretty good listener.

44:38.303 --> 44:40.221
It is complicated.

44:40.305 --> 44:42.891
Oh, what's gnawin' at you?

44:47.395 --> 44:51.107
I put a young girl's
life in danger

44:51.191 --> 44:53.485
to achieve a greater good.

44:53.610 --> 44:56.905
I have been given a
chance to save her,

44:57.030 --> 44:59.616
but to do so would put

44:59.699 --> 45:03.328
many more female lives at risk.

45:03.411 --> 45:04.996
Well, mm...

45:05.080 --> 45:07.248
that <i>is </i>complicated.

45:10.251 --> 45:11.419
(sighs)

45:12.504 --> 45:14.214
Do you know where you
are right now?

45:15.173 --> 45:16.424
No.

45:16.508 --> 45:19.594
You're in the Smoky Mountains
of Tennessee.

45:19.678 --> 45:22.806
I was born and raised in a cabin
pretty much like this one.

45:22.889 --> 45:24.099
As a matter of fact,

45:24.182 --> 45:26.601
your computer didn't
do a half-bad job.

45:26.685 --> 45:27.852
(laughs)

45:28.269 --> 45:31.314
I like to come out to this neck
of the woods every now and again

45:31.398 --> 45:35.318
to kinda clear my head
and do some hard thinking.

45:35.985 --> 45:38.655
I was also raised
in the mountains.

45:38.780 --> 45:40.824
Another mountain girl!

45:40.907 --> 45:43.827
I knew there was some
reason I liked you.

45:44.494 --> 45:47.831
I lived there for
most of my life.

45:47.914 --> 45:51.167
There are days when I
miss the solitude.

45:52.293 --> 45:54.629
You know, when I was
a little girl,

45:54.713 --> 45:56.631
maybe six or seven years old,

45:56.715 --> 46:00.010
I accidentally cut
three of my toes

46:00.093 --> 46:02.178
on a broken mason jar.

46:02.262 --> 46:05.765
I mean they were cut bad,
almost falling off.

46:05.849 --> 46:08.143
Course we lived miles
from the nearest doctor,

46:08.226 --> 46:09.352
and we were real poor,

46:09.436 --> 46:11.896
so my momma had to be
very resourceful.

46:11.980 --> 46:13.732
So, you know what she did?

46:13.815 --> 46:16.735
She used cornmeal to
stop the bleeding,

46:16.860 --> 46:19.988
and she used kerosene
for antiseptic,

46:20.071 --> 46:22.991
and she took her sewing needles,

46:23.074 --> 46:25.994
and she sewed
my little toes back together.

46:26.077 --> 46:27.203
(laughs)

46:27.495 --> 46:30.081
Course my daddy and my brothers
all had to hold me down.

46:30.165 --> 46:32.334
But, it worked, they healed,

46:32.417 --> 46:34.753
and I'm still walking
around today,

46:34.836 --> 46:36.254
on my little tippy toes.

46:36.338 --> 46:37.630
(laughs)

46:37.714 --> 46:41.426
I fail to grasp the meaning
of this parable.

46:41.509 --> 46:44.095
Oh, it don't mean nothin'.
It's just a story.

46:44.679 --> 46:46.306
I'll tell you one thing, though.

46:46.389 --> 46:50.018
My momma knew something needed
to be done right then and there.

46:50.101 --> 46:53.646
If you do the right thing
in the here and now,

46:53.772 --> 46:57.567
the future has a way
of taking care of itself.

46:57.650 --> 46:59.152
(laughs)

46:59.235 --> 47:02.447
Well, at least
that's what my momma taught me.

47:02.572 --> 47:04.032
(laughs)

47:05.325 --> 47:09.079
Do you mind if I, uh,
play a little bit?

47:09.162 --> 47:11.581
I would be honored.

47:11.664 --> 47:15.126
I am a great admirer
of your poetry.

47:15.210 --> 47:17.754
Oh, I'm not sure I'd
call it poetry.

47:17.837 --> 47:21.966
It's just some songs,
but I like doing it. (chuckles)

47:30.016 --> 47:32.477
(singing):

47:32.560 --> 47:35.438

47:36.022 --> 47:38.692

49:09.407 --> 49:11.451
(energy pulsing)

49:17.832 --> 49:19.834
(ominous music playing)

50:25.275 --> 50:26.526
(keypad beeps)

50:30.780 --> 50:33.867
Do as you are told and
you might live.

50:48.256 --> 50:50.925
DEEP MALE VOICE:
You must be exhausted.

50:52.719 --> 50:56.931
Please sit down.

51:08.610 --> 51:10.403
Are you thirsty?

51:12.489 --> 51:15.992
Drink. It is only water.

51:35.136 --> 51:36.638
Where am I?

51:38.515 --> 51:41.601
I will be the one asking
the questions today.

51:42.686 --> 51:45.814
And, my first question is this:

51:45.897 --> 51:49.442
Why do you think you are here?

51:50.193 --> 51:51.611
I do not know.

51:53.697 --> 51:55.281
I believe you.

51:56.616 --> 51:58.660
And, I can see that you
are frightened.

51:59.411 --> 52:03.707
This must all be very
confusing for you.

52:05.917 --> 52:09.087
So, I will tell you
why you are here.

52:09.170 --> 52:12.048
And then, you will answer
my questions.

52:12.132 --> 52:15.635
And, when we are finished,
you will be taken home.

52:18.096 --> 52:20.098
You are a female outcast,

52:20.181 --> 52:22.142
conspiring with other females

52:22.225 --> 52:26.646
to undermine the moral
foundations of Moclan society.

52:26.730 --> 52:28.648
Your leader, Heveena,

52:28.732 --> 52:34.154
has been secretly communicating
with a traitor on Moclus.

52:34.237 --> 52:39.075
We have reason to believe
that you know his identity.

52:39.784 --> 52:41.953
Is this true?

52:42.912 --> 52:45.540
I do not know what you
are talking about.

52:45.999 --> 52:47.125
(sighs)

52:48.918 --> 52:53.089
I will ask you once more.

52:54.382 --> 52:57.594
What is the traitor's name?

53:00.555 --> 53:01.806
(groans)

53:07.187 --> 53:09.439
I prefer not to harm you.

53:10.148 --> 53:11.691
But, I will.

53:12.734 --> 53:16.446
Now, tell me his name.

53:27.832 --> 53:29.876
(epic music playing)

53:36.925 --> 53:39.302
LT. COMMANDER BORTUS:
This world is desolate.

53:39.844 --> 53:42.222
Except... wait.

53:42.305 --> 53:45.183
There are several structures
inside a large canyon.

53:45.266 --> 53:49.145
I am detecting multiple
life signs, all Moclan.

53:49.229 --> 53:50.772
Let's get a closer look.

53:50.855 --> 53:52.607
Engage cloak.

54:03.743 --> 54:05.286
There's no record
of this outpost

54:05.370 --> 54:06.830
in the Union database.

54:06.913 --> 54:08.581
I'm taking us down.

54:49.080 --> 54:51.416
You know you disobeyed orders
by bringing these weapons.

54:53.084 --> 54:54.377
Yes.

54:55.253 --> 54:56.629
Well done.

55:28.745 --> 55:30.997
Priority-one message
from Admiral Halsey:

55:31.081 --> 55:33.500
the Council has convened and
they're awaiting your arrival.

55:33.583 --> 55:35.919
Tell them we're on our way.
You have the bridge.

55:36.503 --> 55:37.962
Permission to join you, Captain?

55:38.672 --> 55:39.714
What for?

55:39.798 --> 55:40.924
Topa's...

55:41.549 --> 55:43.134
kinda like a little sister.

55:43.593 --> 55:45.762
I have a personal investment
in her safety.

55:47.138 --> 55:48.723
All right, come on.

56:16.292 --> 56:19.045
HEVEENA:
I make this confession

56:19.129 --> 56:23.800
not because I believe
what I have done is wrong,

56:23.883 --> 56:28.638
but because a child
has gone missing.

56:28.722 --> 56:33.435
I am doing what must be done
here and now,

56:34.227 --> 56:37.105
no matter what the
future may hold,

56:37.188 --> 56:40.358
and I stand ready to accept

56:40.442 --> 56:44.487
whatever judgment this
Council renders.

56:45.947 --> 56:48.324
I offer my confession
with the hope

56:48.408 --> 56:50.702
and expectation that
this Council

56:50.785 --> 56:54.748
will launch an immediate
investigation

56:54.831 --> 56:57.000
into the whereabouts of Topa,

56:57.083 --> 57:02.380
and work to secure
her safe return.

57:02.464 --> 57:04.632
(delegates murmuring)

57:20.690 --> 57:23.318
Based on Heveena's testimony,

57:23.443 --> 57:25.278
and the physical evidence
provided

57:25.362 --> 57:27.280
by the Orville's Chief
of Security,

57:27.405 --> 57:30.575
this Council believes
there is sufficient basis

57:30.658 --> 57:33.661
to begin a formal investigation.

57:34.496 --> 57:39.209
We request that Commander Kodon
and his inspection team

57:39.292 --> 57:41.920
appear before the Council
with all due haste.

57:42.003 --> 57:43.630
And, what of <i>her </i>crimes?

57:43.713 --> 57:46.424
She is the one who should
be investigated!

57:46.508 --> 57:49.803
She makes the outrageous claim
that we have abducted a child,

57:49.886 --> 57:53.098
when, in fact, she
admits to stealing infants,

57:53.181 --> 57:54.974
and smuggling
them as contraband!

57:55.058 --> 57:58.436
We have every intention
of addressing Heveena's actions,

57:58.520 --> 57:59.979
but at the moment our priority

58:00.063 --> 58:02.148
is the safe return of
the missing child,

58:02.232 --> 58:03.274
and her guardians.

58:03.358 --> 58:05.902
This Council has
no valid reason

58:05.985 --> 58:07.362
to conduct an investigation

58:07.445 --> 58:09.823
of my government or
any of my people!

58:09.948 --> 58:12.575
You have no facts
and no evidence!

58:12.659 --> 58:15.286
Only the word of an
admitted criminal.

58:15.370 --> 58:17.789
The only fact presented
here today,

58:17.872 --> 58:20.709
is that she violated
the agreement.

58:20.792 --> 58:22.460
Arrest her!

58:22.544 --> 58:26.381
Or, you are all complicit
in her crimes!

58:26.464 --> 58:28.800
(delegates murmuring)

58:43.523 --> 58:45.483
(dramatic music playing)

59:07.756 --> 59:09.466
(comscanner chirps)

59:09.549 --> 59:12.552
There is an entry point
2,000 meters ahead.

59:12.635 --> 59:13.887
If we stay within the canyon,

59:13.970 --> 59:16.014
we will remain out of sight
until we reach it.

59:53.218 --> 59:54.344
Commander!

59:54.427 --> 59:57.180
(Kelly groaning)

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:09.651
That was stupid.

01:00:09.734 --> 01:00:11.111
Are you injured?

01:00:11.194 --> 01:00:12.612
My shoulder.

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.280
(comscanner chirping)

01:00:17.033 --> 01:00:18.326
You have torn a ligament.

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:28.253
It will heal shortly.

01:00:30.964 --> 01:00:32.257
I'm sorry, Bortus.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.675
It was an accident.

01:00:33.758 --> 01:00:35.552
That's not what I mean.

01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:37.846
This is my fault.

01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:40.932
I talked you into taking
Topa with us.

01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:43.184
You knew it was a risk,
and I pushed you.

01:00:43.268 --> 01:00:46.354
You cannot blame yourself
for what has happened.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.733
Should've just minded
my own goddamn business.

01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:55.196
I have never told you how much

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.075
I value your presence
in Topa's life.

01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:06.666
It has been difficult for me
since Klyden left us...

01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:09.627
and I do not believe
I would have succeeded

01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:12.630
without your assistance.

01:01:15.842 --> 01:01:17.635
You are...

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.764
a part of our family.

01:01:22.807 --> 01:01:24.976
Topa is very special to me.

01:01:26.269 --> 01:01:29.481
And, you to us.

01:01:36.404 --> 01:01:38.323
(medical device beeps)

01:01:40.116 --> 01:01:41.951
The ligament has healed.

01:01:43.953 --> 01:01:45.038
All right.

01:01:45.538 --> 01:01:46.706
Let's go get her.

01:01:58.218 --> 01:01:59.135
(grunts)

01:01:59.636 --> 01:02:01.179
Please stop!

01:02:01.262 --> 01:02:02.972
I don't know anything!

01:02:03.056 --> 01:02:05.850
You have been brave, Topa.

01:02:06.726 --> 01:02:09.354
Foolish, but brave.

01:02:25.787 --> 01:02:28.123
Do you know what this is?

01:02:28.665 --> 01:02:31.793
It's a Krill instrument
of persuasion.

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:36.047
I spent many years trying
to acquire one.

01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:37.924
Depending on the setting,

01:02:38.008 --> 01:02:40.010
it can cause either
minor discomfort,

01:02:40.552 --> 01:02:43.430
or unbearable agony.

01:02:43.513 --> 01:02:46.016
And, in extreme cases,

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:48.226
permanent neurological damage.

01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:49.644
(electronic sparking)

01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:50.645
Please!

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:56.026
The name.

01:02:56.484 --> 01:02:59.320
While your mind still functions.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:13.918
(dramatic music playing)

01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:17.273
-(Topa shrieking)
-(baton sparking)

01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:21.194
The name!

01:04:24.572 --> 01:04:25.740
(electronics whirring)

01:04:28.618 --> 01:04:30.203
Bortus! Biosigns.

01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:31.996
Female.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.456
This way.

01:05:31.473 --> 01:05:32.974
(shrieking)

01:05:33.475 --> 01:05:34.893
No!

01:05:34.976 --> 01:05:37.604
Please! Please, I'll tell you!

01:05:37.729 --> 01:05:39.981
I am listening.

01:05:55.246 --> 01:05:56.748
She has given the name.

01:05:56.831 --> 01:05:57.999
And the encryption frequencies?

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:00.794
Yes. We are finished here.

01:06:01.252 --> 01:06:02.587
Kill her.

01:06:03.254 --> 01:06:04.881
Dump her body in Sha'var Canyon.

01:06:06.716 --> 01:06:08.093
Touch her and you're dead!

01:06:08.176 --> 01:06:09.386
Papa!

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:14.099
It is all right, Topa.

01:06:14.182 --> 01:06:15.600
We are here.

01:06:16.142 --> 01:06:18.645
You are safe.

01:06:18.728 --> 01:06:20.605
(sobbing)

01:06:25.276 --> 01:06:28.488
Did you do this to her?

01:06:29.114 --> 01:06:31.116
Come on, we gotta get her
back to the shuttle.

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:44.921
Bortus!

01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:51.011
Commander, stand down!

01:06:54.764 --> 01:06:56.266
(screams)

01:06:57.934 --> 01:06:59.728
Stand down, that's
an order, now!

01:07:03.189 --> 01:07:04.441
Let's go.

01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:07.193
(gasping)

01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:41.144
Launch thrusters are still down.

01:07:41.227 --> 01:07:43.688
Topa. You will need to hold on.

01:07:47.567 --> 01:07:48.860
Here we go.

01:08:15.637 --> 01:08:16.971
We are taking fire!

01:08:53.341 --> 01:08:55.760
They're hitting us from above!
I can't gain altitude!

01:09:17.866 --> 01:09:20.035
We can't outrun 'em,
we're going to have to engage.

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.536
Those are O'kta-Class fighters.

01:09:21.619 --> 01:09:23.997
Highly maneuverable,
but they have a weakness.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.791
Drop behind them
and target their exhaust ports.

01:09:49.898 --> 01:09:50.857
(groans)

01:09:58.615 --> 01:10:00.158
(groans)

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.289
We're clear!

01:10:27.435 --> 01:10:30.397
We have no intention
of cooperating

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.066
with this fraudulent
and reckless investigation!

01:10:33.191 --> 01:10:34.984
The Council has made
its decision.

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.153
We reject that decision.

01:10:37.278 --> 01:10:38.988
I'm afraid that's
not how it works.

01:10:39.114 --> 01:10:42.075
With respect, Ambassador,
every member of the Union

01:10:42.158 --> 01:10:43.868
must abide by its rulings.

01:10:43.952 --> 01:10:45.120
AMBASSADOR RECHIK:
Respect?

01:10:45.203 --> 01:10:47.288
Since when has any member
of this Council

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:49.457
shown us the slightest respect?

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:51.876
You chastise and demean
our culture

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.128
at every opportunity!

01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:55.255
This is not a referendum
on your culture.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:57.632
We're simply trying
to find a missing child.

01:10:57.716 --> 01:11:00.969
Then investigate
your Moclan female accomplice!

01:11:01.052 --> 01:11:03.054
She was the last one
to see the girl!

01:11:03.138 --> 01:11:06.099
How do we know she's telling the
truth about her disappearance?

01:11:06.182 --> 01:11:07.809
There is the physical evidence.

01:11:07.892 --> 01:11:09.436
It proves nothing!

01:11:09.519 --> 01:11:12.105
You are grasping for reasons
to blame Moclus!

01:11:12.188 --> 01:11:14.399
Ambassador, look at
the circumstances.

01:11:14.524 --> 01:11:18.069
If our positions were reversed,
you'd be demanding answers too.

01:11:18.194 --> 01:11:21.114
These are difficult times
for the Union, Senator.

01:11:21.239 --> 01:11:24.159
Do you really want to provoke
your most important ally?

01:11:24.242 --> 01:11:26.119
Think of the consequences.

01:11:26.202 --> 01:11:28.788
Could the Union survive
a full-scale Kaylon attack

01:11:28.872 --> 01:11:31.750
if its weapons supply chain
was suddenly interrupted?

01:11:31.833 --> 01:11:33.418
(scoffs)

01:11:35.628 --> 01:11:37.547
Do you have something
to say, human?

01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:42.761
Look, I know I'm not
supposed to talk here,

01:11:42.844 --> 01:11:44.679
and I'm probably gonna get
court-martialed,

01:11:44.763 --> 01:11:46.514
but somebody's gotta
call out these assholes!

01:11:46.598 --> 01:11:49.017
-Gordon, don't--
-Every time they cross a line,

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.393
we let it go because
we're scared

01:11:50.477 --> 01:11:51.770
to fight the Kaylon
without them!

01:11:51.853 --> 01:11:53.646
And, every time we compromise,

01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:55.774
they still act like they're
the ones gettin' the shaft!

01:11:55.899 --> 01:11:56.900
That's enough, Lieutenant!

01:11:56.983 --> 01:11:58.401
You treat people like garbage,

01:11:58.526 --> 01:11:59.903
and then when you
get called on it,

01:11:59.986 --> 01:12:01.071
you bitch and you moan

01:12:01.154 --> 01:12:02.864
that we're not
respecting your "beliefs"!

01:12:02.947 --> 01:12:04.741
-Well, screw you and your--
-Gordon!

01:12:09.746 --> 01:12:11.122
Sorry.

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:16.961
It is time to put an
end to this farce.

01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:19.047
We will address the assembly.

01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:34.437
I have conferred with
my government.

01:12:34.521 --> 01:12:37.524
And, we will no longer
abide by the terms

01:12:37.607 --> 01:12:39.275
of our previous agreement.

01:12:39.776 --> 01:12:43.988
Heveena's illegal actions
have annulled all restrictions.

01:12:44.114 --> 01:12:47.867
Furthermore, we demand
a formal apology

01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:50.995
by this Council for allowing
this travesty

01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:52.622
in the first place.

01:12:52.706 --> 01:12:54.582
(angry murmuring)

01:12:59.754 --> 01:13:04.134
You proposed this compromise,
Admiral Halsey.

01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:06.428
We have abided by it.

01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:08.430
Heveena has not.

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.267
If anyone in this chamber

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:15.603
can credibly dispute the
legality of our position,

01:13:15.687 --> 01:13:18.481
let him stand now!

01:13:18.606 --> 01:13:20.442
(angry murmuring)

01:13:28.533 --> 01:13:30.201
(doors clang open)

01:13:35.165 --> 01:13:36.791
Oh, my god.

01:13:53.308 --> 01:13:56.269
We rescued Topa from
a secret military installation

01:13:56.353 --> 01:13:57.562
in the Zonari System.

01:13:57.645 --> 01:13:59.481
It's a Moclan black site.

01:13:59.856 --> 01:14:02.650
She was taken there
and tortured for information.

01:14:02.776 --> 01:14:03.985
There is no such place!

01:14:04.069 --> 01:14:06.404
We have scans of the
entire facility, Ambassador.

01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:08.740
She refused medical treatment
so that everyone here

01:14:08.823 --> 01:14:11.743
could see for themselves
what the Moclans did to her.

01:14:17.374 --> 01:14:20.877
(muted gasping)

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:24.339
My daughter is fortunate

01:14:24.422 --> 01:14:27.550
to be alive.

01:14:30.095 --> 01:14:34.766
They planned to murder her.

01:14:36.267 --> 01:14:40.355
Members of this Union

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.651
planned to kill my child.

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:50.031
You are liars.

01:14:50.156 --> 01:14:53.493
And, you are butchers.

01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:57.664
And, you must answer
for your crimes!

01:15:03.545 --> 01:15:05.338
(seats clatter)

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.752
Here. Coffee.

01:16:25.835 --> 01:16:26.878
Thanks.

01:16:30.757 --> 01:16:32.258
Hm?

01:16:32.342 --> 01:16:33.927
90-proof blend?

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:35.762
-I thought you might need it.
-You're the best.

01:16:35.845 --> 01:16:38.098
Well, just don't breathe
on the Admirals.

01:16:49.693 --> 01:16:50.694
Bortus...

01:16:52.445 --> 01:16:55.532
I am truly sorry.

01:16:57.075 --> 01:17:00.078
I do not expect you
to forgive me.

01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:02.539
That is a reasonable
expectation.

01:17:11.214 --> 01:17:13.216
The Council has taken
a provisional vote.

01:17:13.299 --> 01:17:15.343
It was unanimous.

01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:17.846
Moclus has been expelled
from the Union.

01:17:19.472 --> 01:17:20.348
(sighs)

01:17:21.266 --> 01:17:22.892
So, what's next?

01:17:22.976 --> 01:17:25.186
The vote still has to
be ratified, but...

01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:27.731
when it is, it'll be
a messy divorce.

01:17:27.856 --> 01:17:29.899
Ship deployments, crew
reassignments,

01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:31.276
shared military assets,

01:17:31.359 --> 01:17:33.153
and at least a dozen
battle groups

01:17:33.236 --> 01:17:34.320
under joint command.

01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:36.573
A lot of ties to sever.

01:17:36.656 --> 01:17:39.159
And, it goes without saying
this will be a major blow

01:17:39.242 --> 01:17:40.577
to our defensive posture.

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:42.662
We're now much more vulnerable
to the Kaylon.

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:44.247
What about the colony?

01:17:45.373 --> 01:17:47.250
The Union has voted
to recognize it

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:48.376
as a sovereign state,

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:51.129
and to place it under
our protection.

01:17:51.212 --> 01:17:52.922
Effective immediately.

01:18:05.852 --> 01:18:07.812
(contemplative music playing)

01:18:38.718 --> 01:18:41.096
Physically she's going
to be fine,

01:18:41.179 --> 01:18:43.556
but she's been through
a terrible trauma,

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.517
especially for someone so young.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.477
She'll need counseling.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.145
I understand.

01:18:50.647 --> 01:18:52.857
When may I take her home?

01:18:53.316 --> 01:18:57.737
I want to run a few more tests,
and then she's all yours.

01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:01.825
Commander...

01:19:02.867 --> 01:19:04.744
There's someone here to see you.

01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:18.967
Klyden...

01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:21.678
When the Captain told
me what happened,

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:24.723
I boarded the first transport
I could find.

01:19:41.239 --> 01:19:43.241
May I speak with her?

01:19:58.923 --> 01:20:00.008
Papa...

01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:02.886
Lie still, Topa.

01:20:03.511 --> 01:20:05.347
You need to rest.

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.515
Papa...

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:10.268
you came back.

01:20:12.604 --> 01:20:14.230
How are you feeling?

01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:17.400
Better now that you are here.

01:20:19.736 --> 01:20:21.321
I missed you.

01:20:22.155 --> 01:20:23.907
I missed you too.

01:20:29.412 --> 01:20:31.122
Topa.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:37.629
The last time I saw you,
I said some very hurtful things.

01:20:38.755 --> 01:20:40.674
I regret my words.

01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:43.593
I understand, Papa.

01:20:44.219 --> 01:20:45.303
It's okay.

01:20:46.429 --> 01:20:47.681
No.

01:20:47.764 --> 01:20:49.516
It is not.

01:20:50.225 --> 01:20:51.267
You...

01:20:51.601 --> 01:20:54.062
were almost lost.

01:20:54.145 --> 01:20:57.440
Because of people who
believed as I did.

01:20:59.234 --> 01:21:00.485
I...

01:21:00.985 --> 01:21:04.322
I... I thought I hated you.

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:08.993
But, even then, I never
wished you harm.

01:21:10.704 --> 01:21:12.288
I simply...

01:21:13.373 --> 01:21:16.918
did not know how to
live with you.

01:21:17.002 --> 01:21:21.756
(sobbing): I allowed a lifetime
of prejudice

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.967
to cloud my judgment.

01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:27.012
That must change.

01:21:27.679 --> 01:21:30.181
I must change.

01:21:32.183 --> 01:21:37.397
I want you to know
that I accept you, Topa,

01:21:38.064 --> 01:21:40.734
exactly as you are.

01:21:41.776 --> 01:21:43.903
And, I am proud...

01:21:44.612 --> 01:21:47.073
to call you my daughter.

01:21:51.327 --> 01:21:53.329
I love you, Papa.

01:21:53.413 --> 01:21:55.874
I love you too.

01:22:15.435 --> 01:22:17.437
(contemplative music playing)

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:40.210
How is your teepok?

01:22:40.293 --> 01:22:42.420
It's as delicious as I remember.

01:22:42.504 --> 01:22:44.214
I am pleased.

01:22:44.297 --> 01:22:46.883
I will prepare it for you
whenever you like.

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:49.886
(door chimes)

01:22:51.429 --> 01:22:52.430
Come in.

01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:56.726
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:59.145
Just wanted to let you know
we'll be leaving orbit soon.

01:22:59.854 --> 01:23:02.607
And, I also wanted to say...

01:23:03.942 --> 01:23:05.652
welcome back, Klyden.

01:23:07.362 --> 01:23:08.780
Thank you, Commander.

01:23:09.989 --> 01:23:11.866
I take it you've
decided to stay?

01:23:11.991 --> 01:23:15.995
We have renounced
our Moclan citizenship.

01:23:16.079 --> 01:23:19.374
Our home is here, now.

01:23:19.457 --> 01:23:23.253
Bortus has told me
of your heroic actions.

01:23:23.336 --> 01:23:26.548
Thank you for saving
my daughter's life.

01:23:28.216 --> 01:23:29.926
Bortus and I make
a pretty good team.

01:23:33.888 --> 01:23:35.974
Well, I'll let you get
back to your meal.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:38.685
Commander.

01:23:42.647 --> 01:23:45.483
Would you like to have
dinner with us?

01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:50.280
He made teepok soup.

01:23:50.363 --> 01:23:51.573
It's spicy.

01:23:53.283 --> 01:23:54.868
I do like spicy.

01:23:55.285 --> 01:23:56.911
Then, please.

01:23:57.287 --> 01:23:58.663
Sit with us.

01:24:40.914 --> 01:24:42.916
(tranquil music rising)

01:25:11.194 --> 01:25:13.321
