WEBVTT

00:01.626 --> 00:03.503
(epic music playing)

00:28.737 --> 00:30.655
They've finished scanning
the fifth chamber, sir.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.073
Requesting permission
to proceed.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.366
Nothing yet, huh?

00:33.450 --> 00:34.743
TALLA KEYALI:
Not even a stick figure.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.077
Just a whole lotta empty walls.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.454
Charly's mapping it all, but...

00:37.537 --> 00:38.955
Buried treasure would
be more fun.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.206
Pretty much.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.375
Well, tell them
they're good to keep moving.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.335
Will do.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.634
-What are you doing?
-Hm?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.386
I see you walking
around all the time

00:53.470 --> 00:54.637
with that data pad lately.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.805
You writing a novel?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.849
No, uh...

00:57.932 --> 00:59.559
it's for Anaya.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.061
Anaya?

01:01.770 --> 01:03.605
I've been writing
letters to her.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.274
To Krill? How the hell are you
getting through?

01:06.858 --> 01:09.110
Well, I don't actually
send them.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.695
I just figured that...

01:10.862 --> 01:13.073
someday, if I do see her again,

01:13.156 --> 01:15.075
they might be something
she'd wanna read.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.993
Since I'm missing her life now,

01:17.077 --> 01:21.122
she can go back in time
and feel like I was there.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.083
You know...

01:23.375 --> 01:25.126
after all these years,

01:25.418 --> 01:27.337
you're still able
to surprise me.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.464
CHARLY BURKE:
Commander!

01:30.632 --> 01:32.717
We've found something!

01:43.812 --> 01:46.564
You've mapped all this, right?
I'd hate to get lost.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.109
Just follow the bread crumbs,
you'll be fine, sir.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.535
Lieutenant, what have you got?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.620
Captain. We have detected
a large chamber

02:00.704 --> 02:01.830
beyond this wall.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.957
Based on Ensign Burke's
cartographic index

02:04.040 --> 02:06.376
of the chambers we have
discovered thus far,

02:06.459 --> 02:09.254
it is possible we have found
the primary burial vault.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.380
Can we get inside?

02:10.630 --> 02:12.841
Hemblicite tombs
are notorious for booby traps.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.509
According to our scans,
this thing is rigged

02:14.592 --> 02:16.094
to kill anyone who
tries to open it.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.887
Well, so how do we breach it?

02:19.389 --> 02:22.642
ISAAC: <i>I would suggest you</i>
<i>step back against the far wall.</i>

02:33.570 --> 02:36.114
(stone rumbling)

02:36.197 --> 02:38.575
(projectiles pinging)

02:43.580 --> 02:45.790
<i>It is now safe to proceed.</i>

02:45.874 --> 02:46.875
(clangs)

02:47.167 --> 02:50.503
You, uh, got
a little something right there.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.011
(rocks clattering)

03:14.361 --> 03:15.403
Jackpot.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.952
(dramatic music swelling)

03:40.804 --> 03:43.848
Scan is complete. Uploading data
for carbon analysis.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.100
ISAAC:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

03:45.183 --> 03:46.518
How old is this stuff?

03:46.601 --> 03:49.729
The oldest artifacts date back
around 70,000 years.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.273
My God. When did they die out?

03:52.357 --> 03:55.068
The Hemblicite Empire
fell about 50,000 years ago.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.779
They were kinda similar
to the ancient Egyptians.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.698
They used to bury their kings
with all kinds of

03:59.781 --> 04:01.658
tools and jewelry and things
that they could use

04:01.741 --> 04:03.827
in the afterlife.
Lucky for us.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.079
Man, you said archaeology
was a hobby.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.455
You sound like an expert.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.748
It's interesting stuff.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.667
I don't do anything half-assed,
Lieutenant.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.502
I can see that. What's
this thing?

04:12.585 --> 04:13.962
It's called a jiktal.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.880
It's a razor for
facial grooming.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.591
You still have to shave
in the afterlife? That sucks.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.052
Well, this is all
undeniably fascinating,

04:21.136 --> 04:22.846
but I'm at the end of
a 12-hour shift,

04:22.929 --> 04:24.973
so, if you're good here,
I'm gonna take off.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.100
No problem,
we'll see you in the morning.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.776
Return fire!

04:39.654 --> 04:42.282
Sir, the Kaylon have disabled
our forward targeting scanners!

04:42.365 --> 04:44.576
Implement source redirect
from the navigational array!

04:44.659 --> 04:47.037
(explosions, sparking)

04:47.120 --> 04:48.496
Fire all torpedoes!

04:50.248 --> 04:52.500
Evasive maneuvers! Hard to port!

04:54.878 --> 04:56.296
Kaylon are countering!

05:00.216 --> 05:01.384
Deflectors are gone!

05:01.468 --> 05:03.094
Divert power from
life support!

05:09.434 --> 05:11.561
(alert chiming)

05:27.535 --> 05:28.870
(roars)

05:28.953 --> 05:30.789
(circuits crackling)

05:35.710 --> 05:37.087
(door chimes)

05:39.506 --> 05:41.007
End simulation.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.761
Come in.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.516
-Commander.
-Topa.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.684
Am I interrupting?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.311
No. I have exceeded
my allotted time.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.521
I apologize.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.690
It's all good, no big deal.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.067
Were you running the
command program?

05:59.150 --> 06:01.611
Yes.
Is that not permitted?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.697
No, it's fine,
there are no restrictions.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.533
You just... don't usually see
people your age using it.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.910
I have yet to master
its intricacies.

06:08.993 --> 06:11.246
Well, it's not easy,
that's the whole point.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.539
How far have you gotten?

06:12.622 --> 06:13.957
The Kaylon destroy my ship

06:14.040 --> 06:16.167
seven minutes into the
battle every time.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.878
Believe it or not, that's a
long time for a beginner.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.006
Is this just for fun?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.717
I was thinking

06:23.967 --> 06:25.802
that when I am old enough...

06:27.095 --> 06:28.972
Commander, I am interested
in taking

06:29.055 --> 06:31.016
the Union Point entrance
examination.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.392
You are?

06:32.475 --> 06:33.935
Topa, that's great.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.311
Have you told Bortus?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.689
Yes. He has given
his blessing,

06:37.772 --> 06:39.691
but he has warned me
of the difficulty involved.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.027
It's a mountain to
climb for sure,

06:42.110 --> 06:44.487
but the fact that you're
challenging yourself like this

06:44.571 --> 06:45.905
shows the right initiative.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.867
If you're serious about it,

06:48.950 --> 06:50.952
and you want to get
an early start,

06:51.036 --> 06:52.787
I'd be happy to give
you some guidance.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.957
That is very kind
of you, Commander.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.293
How about we find a couple of
days this coming week,

06:58.376 --> 07:00.003
and as long as it's all
general clearance,

07:00.086 --> 07:01.171
you can shadow me,

07:01.254 --> 07:02.714
get a sense of what
service entails.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.466
I would be very grateful.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.509
Okay, we'll set it up.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.178
Thank you, Commander.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.600
(door opens)

07:13.683 --> 07:14.893
(closes)

07:18.188 --> 07:20.106
(theme song playing)

09:00.331 --> 09:02.834
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.129
Topa. You're early.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.797
I apologize, Commander.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.549
No, don't apologize,
it's fine.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.925
We can get a jump on the day.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.886
Come on, let's go.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.642
First up on the schedule:
daily rounds.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.977
They can be kind of boring,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.271
but a vessel this size
has a lot of moving parts.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.273
Someone needs to make sure
that the ship's left hand

09:25.357 --> 09:27.108
knows what the right
hand is doing.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.402
That includes things like
power allocation requests,

09:29.486 --> 09:30.945
status updates,

09:31.029 --> 09:33.448
and most importantly,
basic morale.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.241
They like to know you're
paying attention.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.534
Good morning, Commander.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.744
Good morning, Lieutenant.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.871
Also, with so many
different species

09:39.954 --> 09:41.498
working on the same ship,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.833
the occasional culture clash
is inevitable,

09:43.917 --> 09:46.086
and all those headaches fall
under the purview of

09:46.169 --> 09:48.088
the First Officer.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.300
All right, thanks.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.052
Commander. Thanks for coming by.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.595
No problem, Biggins,
what's up?

09:56.554 --> 09:57.514
That.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.770
Oh. Yeah.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.106
Yeah, I've never worked
with a Belkarian officer,

10:06.189 --> 10:08.066
but Commander Keyali told us
to be prepared.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.026
Well, we wouldn't be the first
to have to navigate it.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.111
Did you talk to him?

10:11.194 --> 10:13.196
He insists he's within
his rights.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.281
(sighs)

10:19.619 --> 10:21.871
Hey. Lieutenant Bolobar?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.456
Ensign Bolobar, sir.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.000
Ensign, right.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.544
I couldn't remember
without the, uh... shoulders.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.421
Which is a good segue, actually.

10:29.504 --> 10:32.048
I'm gonna have to ask you
to put on a uniform.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.425
In the Belkarian faith,

10:33.508 --> 10:35.301
to wear clothing
on the first day of the month,

10:35.385 --> 10:37.846
is considered an affront
to the work of the Spirit Lord.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.015
I have explained this
to Lieutenant Biggins.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.683
Yeah, I heard.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.227
Ensign, you must know a uniform

10:44.310 --> 10:46.646
is a basic requirement
for service in the fleet.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.648
What about Lieutenant Unk
in engineering?

10:48.732 --> 10:49.858
He does not wear a uniform.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.901
Unk is half the size
of a shuttlecraft.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.069
He'd have to wear a tent.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.904
The Union is supposed
to respect

10:54.988 --> 10:56.281
all cultural traditions.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.658
True, but that
works both ways.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.453
Look, I don't want to disrespect
your religion,

11:01.536 --> 11:03.955
but maybe there's a
sensible compromise

11:04.039 --> 11:06.207
between your faith
and Union protocol,

11:06.291 --> 11:08.418
that would satisfy
everyone involved.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.919
What do you suggest?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.921
Put some pants on,
and we'll call it a day.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.217
Very well, Commander.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.892
Hey, Commander, sir.
Top of the morning.

11:23.975 --> 11:24.893
Hi, Yaphit.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.061
Commander, I'm glad
you're here.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.103
We're gonna need clearance

11:27.187 --> 11:29.064
for an extra 15%
power allocation

11:29.147 --> 11:30.315
to purge the neutron filters

11:30.398 --> 11:32.025
in the dysonium matrix
this afternoon.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.234
No problem.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.569
By the way, hope you don't mind,

11:34.652 --> 11:36.279
Topa's shadowing me
for a couple days.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.990
Little pre-prep for the
Union Point entrance exam.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.033
Ah, for real?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.369
Wow, Topa, that's really cool.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.370
(speaking alien language)

11:45.080 --> 11:49.626
I believe I would like to do
what Commander Grayson does.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.504
I haven't told him how much
day drinking that requires.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.673
(laughs) Good one, Commander.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.007
Hey, I just want you to know

11:56.091 --> 11:57.842
we always enjoy your
visits down here.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.094
Thanks, Yaphit.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.474
Just for your own education,
that's called ass kissing.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.767
"Ass kissing."

12:05.850 --> 12:08.103
Will it be on the entrance exam?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.938
(laughs) No, it won't be.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.024
I know a lot of this
seems pretty dull,

12:13.108 --> 12:16.194
but Union service is
as much about mundane busy work

12:16.277 --> 12:17.612
as it is about adventure.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.823
No, it is not dull.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.408
I want to know everything.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.034
Yeah, you say that now...

12:23.118 --> 12:25.120
If I can ask, Commander,

12:25.203 --> 12:27.372
why did you choose
to join the Fleet?

12:28.206 --> 12:32.085
I was always someone who was
comfortable with responsibility.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.087
I was usually the one
who volunteered

12:34.170 --> 12:36.339
to watch the younger kids
on a field trip,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.383
or captain the soccer team.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.553
And I liked the satisfaction

12:41.636 --> 12:44.264
of helping other people succeed
at their jobs.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.391
I knew a command position
in the Fleet

12:46.474 --> 12:49.144
would mean a long,
slow climb through a system,

12:49.227 --> 12:51.855
but I also knew it
would be worth it.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.357
What about you? Why do
you want to join?

12:57.569 --> 13:00.030
Ever since I was
a young child,

13:00.113 --> 13:02.115
I have always felt...

13:02.824 --> 13:04.117
incomplete.

13:04.951 --> 13:09.456
As if the person I am
today is a bookmark.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.960
A placeholder, until
I discover who I am.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.755
I have not found the
answer at home,

13:16.838 --> 13:19.632
so perhaps it is out
among the stars.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.595
You've... felt this
way for some time?

13:23.678 --> 13:25.889
I once heard Dr. Finn say that,

13:25.972 --> 13:28.266
"If you wake up in the
middle of the night

13:28.350 --> 13:31.895
"and there is nothing to keep
you from falling asleep again,

13:31.978 --> 13:33.938
it means you are happy."

13:36.900 --> 13:38.401
I think that maybe...

13:39.652 --> 13:41.446
I am not happy.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.824
You don't sleep well?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.786
I always feel as if...

13:48.703 --> 13:50.663
there is something
wrong with me.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.208
But I cannot tell what.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.337
Lieutenant Malloy says many
people my age feel this way.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.131
Perhaps it is normal.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.305
Lieutenant Felina's
doing much better

14:07.389 --> 14:09.391
after the neural regeneration
therapy,

14:09.474 --> 14:11.851
so I'd say it's safe to put her
back on limited duty.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.562
All right, I'll have Kelly
put her back on the roster.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.189
How's Isaac doing?

14:16.272 --> 14:19.067
As far as I can see,
remarkably well.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.569
Ever since the suicide attempt,

14:21.653 --> 14:23.905
the crew's softened a
little toward him.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.615
Power of compassion.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.033
Even Charly?

14:27.617 --> 14:29.577
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.247
-Hi, Commander.
-Hey.

14:33.081 --> 14:33.998
You guys busy?

14:34.082 --> 14:35.333
No, we were just wrapping up.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.334
What's going on?

14:36.418 --> 14:37.627
What's the latest
with the dig?

14:37.711 --> 14:39.796
Union Central is sending
a science team

14:39.879 --> 14:41.381
to take over the excavation.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.091
Aw, just when it
was getting good.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.426
Yeah. Well, they'll be
here in a week,

14:44.509 --> 14:45.760
so enjoy it while it lasts.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.097
Have either of you...

14:49.806 --> 14:52.934
spent any time talking
to Topa recently?

14:53.018 --> 14:54.102
I haven't, no.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.311
No. What's up?

14:56.146 --> 14:57.647
I'm worried about him.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.065
What's the matter?

15:01.443 --> 15:05.363
I think that, at some point,
possibly soon...

15:05.947 --> 15:09.617
the person he is and
the person he was...

15:10.243 --> 15:12.037
are going to collide
with each other.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.080
Has he said something to you?

15:14.164 --> 15:16.332
In a general sense, yes.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.002
He's struggling, emotionally.
He's confused.

15:19.544 --> 15:20.670
He knows...

15:22.630 --> 15:25.133
He knows there's
something different about him.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.427
Oh, boy.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.305
Why don't you have him
drop by my office?

15:30.388 --> 15:31.639
He and I can have a talk,

15:31.723 --> 15:35.393
and it will allow me
to do a casual evaluation.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.520
It might be a little
early for that.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.399
He confided in me and it's
possible he could see that

15:41.483 --> 15:43.234
as a breach of trust
at this point.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.445
I just...

15:48.114 --> 15:49.407
I need guidance.

15:50.367 --> 15:54.079
When he tells me this stuff,
I feel like a horrible person.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.997
I feel like I'm
lying to him with my silence.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.165
I mean, there are times--

15:57.374 --> 15:58.875
There are times
I want to scream it out loud,

15:58.958 --> 16:00.085
"You were, you were born female.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.961
You were altered without
your knowledge."

16:02.045 --> 16:03.380
And then just...

16:04.923 --> 16:07.884
let him decide for himself
how he wants to handle it.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.095
I think

16:10.178 --> 16:12.681
it may be time to
talk to Bortus.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.309
(deep breath)

16:26.069 --> 16:28.780
-(door chimes)
-Yes?

16:30.573 --> 16:32.409
-Hey, guys.
-Commander.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.370
Please, sit. I don't mean
to interrupt your dinner.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.747
Have you seen Topa?
He is late.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.332
I have him helping
Ensign Burke

16:39.416 --> 16:41.543
with the recalibration
of the navigational array.

16:41.626 --> 16:42.836
Part of his exam prep.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.880
We both appreciate the time
you have spent with him.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.382
It's my pleasure.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.175
Please, join us.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.973
Have some Kolp.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.350
-Uh, is that the--
-It is the green one.

16:57.434 --> 16:58.685
Right.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.898
Listen, I have to confess,
I had a...

17:07.736 --> 17:08.820
I had an ulterior motive

17:08.903 --> 17:10.697
for putting Topa to
work at dinnertime.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.116
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.367
What is it?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.829
I understand that it's
inappropriate

17:17.912 --> 17:18.788
within your culture

17:18.872 --> 17:21.124
for me to bring this up, but...

17:21.207 --> 17:23.877
have you two ever discussed
telling Topa?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.045
About his origins?

17:25.128 --> 17:26.546
You are correct, Commander.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.757
It is entirely inappropriate!

17:28.840 --> 17:30.967
How dare you enter
our home and--

17:31.051 --> 17:31.968
Klyden!

17:35.680 --> 17:38.224
We have discussed the matter
on several occasions,

17:38.308 --> 17:39.267
and we feel--

17:39.351 --> 17:41.811
We do not feel the
time is right.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.564
And that's your decision,
of course,

17:44.647 --> 17:46.483
you're his parents, but

17:46.566 --> 17:50.528
if I can offer
an outsider's perspective,

17:50.612 --> 17:52.822
I think there may be
some residual damage

17:52.906 --> 17:55.367
that could have had a ripple
effect down through the years.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.951
This kid is unhappy.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.038
All children are unhappy.
He will outgrow it.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.749
I don't want to betray
his confidence

18:02.832 --> 18:04.542
if he hasn't said
anything to you,

18:04.626 --> 18:06.252
but he thinks there's something
wrong with him.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.755
-What?
-He doesn't know.

18:10.298 --> 18:13.009
Look, everyone at this
table is aware

18:13.093 --> 18:15.095
that we're talking about someone
who was surgically altered

18:15.178 --> 18:16.554
without their knowledge
or consent--

18:16.638 --> 18:19.391
Commander, you have overstayed
your welcome.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.934
You may go now.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.443
Please. Talk to your son.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.406
I apologize for disturbing
your evening.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.079
-Klyden.
-No!

18:41.162 --> 18:42.789
She could be correct.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.290
She is a female!

18:44.374 --> 18:47.127
With no understanding
of our culture!

18:47.210 --> 18:48.920
If Topa is struggling--

18:49.004 --> 18:51.756
If he is struggling,
it is insignificant

18:51.840 --> 18:53.550
compared to the struggle
he would face

18:53.633 --> 18:55.510
if he were to learn the truth!

18:56.970 --> 18:58.805
It occurs to me...

19:00.015 --> 19:04.811
that in all the time
we have been together,

19:04.894 --> 19:08.606
I have never once known you
to be uncertain.

19:08.690 --> 19:09.858
Of anything.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.568
Tell me,

19:11.651 --> 19:14.070
what is it like to be so wise?

19:14.154 --> 19:15.572
You are mocking me.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.948
You invite it.

19:17.032 --> 19:20.201
Do you know how much pain
I would have been spared

19:20.285 --> 19:24.164
had I not discovered
that I was born female?

19:24.956 --> 19:26.791
I would never, ever

19:26.875 --> 19:29.669
force our son
to endure such a life!

19:30.295 --> 19:33.298
I love him with all
my heart! Do you?

19:33.381 --> 19:34.257
Of course, I do!

19:34.341 --> 19:35.925
Then listen to me!

19:36.926 --> 19:40.930
Bortus, I would give anything

19:41.014 --> 19:43.975
to be ignorant of my beginnings.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.811
Topa may never be happy...

19:48.063 --> 19:51.983
but unhappiness is better
than despair.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.450
(pensive music playing)

20:08.833 --> 20:10.001
(door chimes)

20:10.085 --> 20:11.294
Come in.

20:13.338 --> 20:16.049
Hey, there you are.
We were scheduled for 1500.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.343
I am sorry, Commander.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.552
Punctuality.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.138
Requirement number one
for a Union officer.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.640
I...

20:23.723 --> 20:25.934
will not be able to continue
the training.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.646
-Why not?
-My father has forbidden it.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.273
He has told me that if
I wish to resume,

20:32.357 --> 20:33.942
I can ask the captain.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.735
But not you.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.321
Topa, I'm...

20:39.698 --> 20:40.782
I'm so sorry.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.785
I have great respect
for the captain.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.829
But it is not the same.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.997
I feel...

20:48.081 --> 20:50.542
a connection with you.

20:51.501 --> 20:54.045
Perhaps you could talk to
my father and change his mind.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.091
I don't know that talking
to Klyden will do any good.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.342
You could try.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.677
Topa...

21:02.929 --> 21:05.515
this hurts me more
than you can possibly imagine,

21:05.598 --> 21:07.684
but you have to believe me
when I tell you

21:07.767 --> 21:09.185
that I am powerless here.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.937
As much as I hate him...

21:11.813 --> 21:13.857
as much as I hate his answer...

21:15.525 --> 21:16.985
he's your father.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.779
I do not want to give up.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.408
If I could someday
be like you...

21:24.451 --> 21:26.244
have a noble purpose,

21:26.327 --> 21:29.247
to inspire people
to become their best selves...

21:29.998 --> 21:32.542
perhaps I would not feel so sad.

21:40.967 --> 21:41.968
(sighs)

21:43.970 --> 21:45.513
(door opens)

21:49.517 --> 21:50.685
Hey there, Topa.

21:50.769 --> 21:51.978
Hello, sir.

21:52.062 --> 21:53.396
Oh, you don't have
to call me "sir"

21:53.480 --> 21:54.981
until you're wearing a uniform.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.734
You wanna see something cool?

21:59.361 --> 22:01.446
We're using a combination
of DNA fragments

22:01.529 --> 22:02.822
embedded in the artifacts,

22:02.906 --> 22:04.407
along with sculptural
renderings,

22:04.491 --> 22:07.786
to reconstruct an approximation
of the Hemblicites' appearance.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.537
Up till now, nobody knew
what they looked like.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.791
But thanks to modern science,
we can make a good guess.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.167
You wanna see?

22:21.925 --> 22:24.094
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

22:24.177 --> 22:26.054
You're looking at a race
that's been dead

22:26.137 --> 22:28.390
for tens of thousands of years.

22:34.646 --> 22:36.022
Please excuse me.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.535
ISAAC:
<i>Hello, Topa.</i>

22:48.618 --> 22:50.078
Isaac...

22:51.246 --> 22:54.416
What is it like? To be dead?

22:54.499 --> 22:57.168
ISAAC: <i>It is the opposite</i>
<i>of being alive.</i>

22:58.044 --> 23:01.089
When you... deactivated
yourself...

23:02.257 --> 23:04.217
what did it feel like?

23:04.300 --> 23:07.679
<i>I was deactivated.</i>
<i>I felt nothing.</i>

23:08.346 --> 23:09.931
Were you...

23:10.015 --> 23:12.892
unhappy when they
brought you back?

23:12.976 --> 23:16.062
ISAAC: <i>I am incapable</i>
<i>of happiness or misery.</i>

23:16.146 --> 23:18.982
<i>May I ask the purpose</i>
<i>of your inquiry?</i>

23:20.066 --> 23:21.401
I was...

23:21.484 --> 23:23.111
just curious.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.672
-(door chimes)
-Come in!

23:44.758 --> 23:46.593
Isaac. Hi.

23:46.676 --> 23:49.596
ISAAC: <i>Hello, Commander.</i>
<i>I apologize for disturbing you.</i>

23:49.679 --> 23:50.972
No, it's fine. What's up?

23:51.056 --> 23:52.474
ISAAC:
<i>It is my understanding</i>

23:52.557 --> 23:54.476
<i>that a visit to a crew</i>
<i>member's quarters</i>

23:54.559 --> 23:55.810
<i>during off-duty hours</i>

23:55.894 --> 23:58.063
<i>can invite speculation</i>
<i>regarding intent.</i>

23:58.146 --> 23:59.397
<i>If you wish,</i>

23:59.689 --> 24:02.067
<i>I will send a ship-wide</i>
<i>communique assuring the crew</i>

24:02.150 --> 24:05.153
<i>that this was not a romantic</i>
<i>or sexual encounter.</i>

24:05.236 --> 24:09.908
I-- I would just not say
anything, it's all good.

24:09.991 --> 24:11.201
What can I do for you?

24:11.284 --> 24:13.328
ISAAC: <i>Topa came to the</i>
<i>astrophysics lab</i>

24:13.411 --> 24:14.579
<i>to speak with me.</i>

24:14.662 --> 24:16.790
<i>He had many questions</i>

24:16.873 --> 24:19.459
<i>regarding my attempt to</i>
<i>deactivate myself.</i>

24:20.418 --> 24:21.711
What kind of questions?

24:21.961 --> 24:24.422
ISAAC: <i>He wished to know</i>
<i>what it was like to be dead.</i>

24:26.549 --> 24:27.550
What else?

24:27.676 --> 24:29.469
ISAAC:
<i>He asked if I was...</i>

24:29.552 --> 24:31.179
<i>unhappy to be revived.</i>

24:32.806 --> 24:34.099
I see...

24:34.182 --> 24:36.601
ISAAC: <i>I am aware</i>
<i>that Union medical protocol</i>

24:36.685 --> 24:39.396
<i>recommends disclosure</i>
<i>of this variety of information</i>

24:39.479 --> 24:40.814
<i>to a superior officer.</i>

24:40.897 --> 24:43.566
It does. Thank you
for telling me.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.235
ISAAC:
<i>Good day, Commander.</i>

25:02.377 --> 25:03.753
(indistinct chatter)

25:13.471 --> 25:14.431
Topa.

25:15.390 --> 25:18.393
Commander.
I should not be speaking to you.

25:18.476 --> 25:20.937
It's okay, we're not
talking about work.

25:21.021 --> 25:23.231
You're still technically
obeying your father.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.358
I just...

25:25.984 --> 25:27.360
wanted to see how
you were doing.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.863
-I am fine.
-Yeah?

25:29.946 --> 25:31.322
Yes.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.241
You know,

25:33.324 --> 25:35.618
if there's ever anything
you needed to talk about...

25:35.702 --> 25:37.412
just as a friend...

25:37.495 --> 25:39.539
I'm here. Always.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.584
Thank you, Commander.
I will be all right.

25:56.765 --> 25:58.558
Sometimes, when
I'm feeling low,

25:58.641 --> 26:00.602
or just a little unsure
of myself...

26:01.227 --> 26:02.645
I have a slice of Kimbok.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.606
Moclan Opsadda cake.

26:04.689 --> 26:07.609
Yeah. Usually makes me feel
a whole lot better.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.527
Perhaps I will
have some later.

26:09.611 --> 26:13.198
There are several different
Kimbok recipes on file.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.075
You should search the database.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.285
I'm sure you can find
one to your liking.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.912
If you look hard enough.

26:51.528 --> 26:52.696
Papa?

27:01.454 --> 27:03.957
Inquiry. Show me "Kimbok."

27:07.502 --> 27:10.422
How many recipe patterns
for Kimbok are on file?

27:10.505 --> 27:13.800
COMPUTER: <i>There are</i>
<i>41 recipe patterns for Kimbok.</i>

27:13.883 --> 27:15.343
<i>They are available</i>
<i>for replication</i>

27:15.427 --> 27:17.220
<i>at all food synthesizers.</i>

27:17.721 --> 27:19.055
Are there any other files

27:19.139 --> 27:20.932
containing
the designation "Kimbok"?

27:22.851 --> 27:26.312
COMPUTER: <i>There is one file.</i>
<i>Designation Kimbok33.</i>

27:26.396 --> 27:30.150
<i>Dated Union Standard 735 2417.</i>

27:30.233 --> 27:31.860
May I see it?

27:31.943 --> 27:34.029
COMPUTER:
<i>The file is password protected.</i>

27:34.988 --> 27:35.864
(sighs)

27:42.370 --> 27:44.039
One piece of Kimbok.

27:55.383 --> 27:57.802
-(monitor chimes)
-COMPUTER: <i>Incoming message.</i>

28:13.193 --> 28:16.112
Access file Kimbok33.

28:16.196 --> 28:19.741
Password Gomaskah 488.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.369
COMPUTER:
<i>Password verified.</i>

28:29.918 --> 28:31.920
(pensive music growing louder)

28:46.393 --> 28:49.688
-CLAIRE: It's your own fault.
-I know that.

28:49.771 --> 28:50.980
I just--

28:51.064 --> 28:52.774
he said he had another
human friend

28:52.857 --> 28:54.150
who could tolerate it.

28:54.442 --> 28:57.570
I've never met a single human
who could eat a Baliddian tart

28:57.654 --> 29:00.448
without some kind
of horrible allergic reaction.

29:00.532 --> 29:01.783
Well, I won't do it again.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.368
For God's sake, you're
a grown man,

29:03.451 --> 29:04.452
you should know better.

29:04.536 --> 29:06.830
It just looked super tasty.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.666
All those little green sprinkles
and whatnot.

29:09.749 --> 29:12.377
Doctor. I need to talk to you.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.586
Sure.

29:14.504 --> 29:16.673
Run this over your face
for three minutes.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.929
What's wrong with him?

29:23.013 --> 29:25.056
He's a child with
no self-control.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.558
How can I help you?

29:28.226 --> 29:30.311
I need to talk to
you about Topa.

29:30.395 --> 29:31.646
And...

29:32.480 --> 29:34.649
I need you to tell me
if I've done a bad thing.

29:43.908 --> 29:44.826
Bortus.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.579
Klyden. How was your game?

29:47.662 --> 29:50.582
We did not play. Topa
never arrived.

29:50.665 --> 29:51.750
That is odd.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.294
He has never missed
a Grand Latchkum.

29:55.003 --> 29:56.629
-(comm chirps)
-Inquiry.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.423
What is Topa's location?

29:58.506 --> 30:00.592
COMPUTER: <i>Topa is currently</i>
<i>in crew quarters.</i>

30:12.896 --> 30:15.315
Topa. Where have you been?

30:15.398 --> 30:17.692
I waited for you in
the simulator.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.654
Are you all right?

30:24.240 --> 30:26.117
Was I born female?

30:29.621 --> 30:31.623
-Topa...
-Answer me.

30:32.499 --> 30:34.918
How could you possibly
ask such a thing?

30:35.001 --> 30:36.419
Answer me.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.713
Of course not!

30:45.220 --> 30:46.554
Where...

30:47.472 --> 30:48.890
where did you get that?

30:49.391 --> 30:50.600
Does it matter?

30:51.226 --> 30:52.811
Was it Commander Grayson?

30:52.894 --> 30:55.397
TOPA:
Tell me the truth.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.816
Was I born female?

31:01.277 --> 31:02.404
Yes.

31:11.121 --> 31:12.455
(computer chirps)

31:14.499 --> 31:16.376
Why did you not tell me?

31:17.877 --> 31:20.046
It was for your
own well-being.

31:21.214 --> 31:23.174
We wanted to protect you.

31:23.758 --> 31:27.220
Were you ever going
to tell me?

31:31.391 --> 31:33.518
We did not know.

31:33.601 --> 31:37.355
It did not appear to
serve a purpose.

31:37.439 --> 31:39.315
You have been lying to me.

31:39.983 --> 31:42.986
My entire life has been a lie.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.279
No!

31:44.362 --> 31:48.825
Topa, you were born malformed,
it is true,

31:48.908 --> 31:50.910
but the doctors made you well!

31:50.994 --> 31:53.705
You are male now! That
is all that--

31:53.788 --> 31:55.206
I may appear to be male...

31:56.458 --> 31:59.377
but what is inside
me still exists.

32:00.587 --> 32:04.174
It is why I have felt the way
I have for so long.

32:05.342 --> 32:10.597
My body has been screaming to me
that I am someone else.

32:13.058 --> 32:14.351
I am...

32:16.019 --> 32:17.645
I am sorry.

32:17.729 --> 32:18.980
KLYDEN: Topa.

32:19.564 --> 32:22.442
To leave you as you were
would have been--

32:22.525 --> 32:24.277
Unthinkable.

32:24.361 --> 32:25.487
Yes.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.114
Moclus has taught me,

32:29.032 --> 32:31.201
you have taught me,

32:31.284 --> 32:33.453
that to be female...

32:33.536 --> 32:35.872
is an aberration of nature.

32:37.457 --> 32:39.292
I have heard the lesson clearly.

32:39.376 --> 32:44.047
Moclus is an imperfect
society. What is taught--

32:44.130 --> 32:46.841
-Bortus, you cannot--
-Klyden, you will be silent!

32:50.553 --> 32:51.930
We love you.

32:53.431 --> 32:56.851
For everything that you are.

32:56.935 --> 32:58.478
And were.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.043
(sighs)

33:25.255 --> 33:26.464
(banging on door)

33:27.549 --> 33:28.508
Come in...

33:30.051 --> 33:32.012
How dare you!

33:32.512 --> 33:34.180
Is there something
I can do for you, Klyden?

33:34.264 --> 33:35.682
If we were on Moclus,

33:35.765 --> 33:39.310
I would be within my rights to
break your little neck.

33:39.394 --> 33:43.231
Well, we're not on Moclus,
but you're welcome to try.

33:45.567 --> 33:49.029
No? Then I suggest you back
the hell away from my desk.

33:51.156 --> 33:54.409
My son is in emotional ruin
because of you.

33:54.492 --> 33:56.536
I told him to have a slice of
Kimbok. That's all I said.

33:56.619 --> 33:59.539
You gave him the password
for the trial records!

33:59.622 --> 34:01.916
-No, I didn't.
-You are a liar!

34:02.000 --> 34:04.085
I pointed him in the right
direction, yes, I admi--

34:04.169 --> 34:06.880
Who are you to decide
what is best for my child?!

34:06.963 --> 34:09.174
-Somebody has to!
-My son was content!

34:09.257 --> 34:11.051
Your son was miserable!

34:11.593 --> 34:13.970
You wrecked that kid the second
you walked into that courtroom,

34:14.054 --> 34:15.722
so do not try to pin
this bullshit on me!

34:15.805 --> 34:19.225
I remember when we were
in the Kandar system.

34:19.309 --> 34:22.729
You were worshiped as a god
by the planet's inhabitants.

34:22.812 --> 34:25.190
Perhaps you still believe
it yourself.

34:25.732 --> 34:29.402
Perhaps that is why you chose
to play god with my family.

34:29.486 --> 34:30.945
I played god?!

34:31.029 --> 34:32.906
Klyden, that kid
has been crying out for help,

34:32.989 --> 34:34.699
and you've been burying
your fat head in the sand

34:34.783 --> 34:37.911
because the truth doesn't fit in
with your backward worldview!

34:37.994 --> 34:39.621
Now, I may have overstepped,

34:39.704 --> 34:42.165
but somebody needed
to start paying attention.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.084
Because that child
is in trouble.

34:44.167 --> 34:47.003
And no matter how much
it hurts you to know it,

34:47.087 --> 34:49.547
underneath that manufactured
exterior,

34:49.631 --> 34:52.092
Topa is still female.

34:57.472 --> 34:58.723
I'm gonna use my imagination

34:58.807 --> 35:00.475
and pretend that didn't
just happen.

35:00.558 --> 35:01.893
Then I'm gonna let go,

35:02.018 --> 35:04.104
and you're gonna get the
hell out of my office.

35:04.187 --> 35:07.357
If you ever try to strike
an officer again,

35:07.440 --> 35:09.317
I'm gonna break your
goddamn arm off

35:09.401 --> 35:10.902
and mount it on my wall.

35:10.985 --> 35:12.237
You hear me?

35:12.904 --> 35:14.197
-(groans)
-Do you hear me?

35:14.280 --> 35:15.615
Yes!

35:23.123 --> 35:24.791
(door opens)

35:26.334 --> 35:27.711
(closes)

35:34.509 --> 35:36.302
(tranquil music playing)

35:54.779 --> 35:55.905
(door chimes)

35:57.449 --> 35:58.700
Come in.

36:01.369 --> 36:02.495
Bortus...

36:02.579 --> 36:04.622
I am sorry to intrude,
Commander.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.375
No, please, come on in.

36:08.251 --> 36:10.045
I require your help.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.296
Of course.

36:12.422 --> 36:15.717
Topa will not speak
to Klyden, or to me.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.511
I know.

36:20.305 --> 36:21.765
If it means anything,

36:21.848 --> 36:23.391
Claire's been able
to talk to him.

36:24.434 --> 36:27.145
It's a good sign, at least he's
opening up to someone.

36:28.605 --> 36:30.106
It may just take some time.

36:35.612 --> 36:36.946
Sit down, please.

36:47.123 --> 36:48.333
Bortus...

36:49.959 --> 36:52.045
I am so sorry I caused this.

36:53.463 --> 36:54.506
I...

36:56.007 --> 37:01.012
I just saw this kid in a place
of such despair, and...

37:02.931 --> 37:04.849
I was only trying to help him.

37:06.559 --> 37:11.314
But the fact is, I was
way out of line.

37:11.981 --> 37:13.233
It wasn't my place.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.569
You are not responsible.

37:17.404 --> 37:19.447
I was the one
who led him to the Kimbok file.

37:20.073 --> 37:21.991
I gave him the password.

37:24.869 --> 37:25.954
What?

37:26.496 --> 37:28.123
I was on the bridge.

37:28.415 --> 37:30.083
Commander Keyali was occupied,

37:30.166 --> 37:33.128
and I was monitoring the
security station.

37:34.087 --> 37:35.296
There was an alert

37:35.505 --> 37:38.591
that someone was attempting
to access a coded file.

37:39.634 --> 37:41.469
I saw that it was Topa.

37:41.553 --> 37:42.637
So...

37:44.514 --> 37:46.182
I sent it to him.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.687
You wanted him to know.

37:54.190 --> 37:55.442
It...

37:56.151 --> 37:57.694
happened in the moment.

37:57.777 --> 38:00.113
It was not premeditated.

38:01.281 --> 38:02.574
Have you told him?

38:03.074 --> 38:04.826
No, no.

38:07.537 --> 38:09.080
But I do not...

38:11.082 --> 38:13.084
I do not know how to help him!

38:29.601 --> 38:30.685
(gasps)

38:40.320 --> 38:42.530
♪♪

38:53.958 --> 38:55.126
How's the patient?

38:55.210 --> 38:57.337
Well, the good news is,

38:57.420 --> 38:59.506
I'm not worried about self-harm
at the moment.

38:59.589 --> 39:01.758
Regardless of the
psychological upheaval

39:01.841 --> 39:03.218
caused by this discovery,

39:03.301 --> 39:06.096
I genuinely believe
you did the right thing.

39:06.805 --> 39:08.515
I wish I had your confidence.

39:08.598 --> 39:09.974
It was a reckless move.

39:10.058 --> 39:12.060
Well, that's why
the most important thing

39:12.143 --> 39:15.063
we can do right
now is listen.

39:15.897 --> 39:17.774
Topa is going to have
to guide us.

39:18.525 --> 39:19.609
Can I go in?

39:28.410 --> 39:29.369
Hi.

39:33.498 --> 39:35.041
You knew.

39:35.125 --> 39:38.378
I wanted to tell
you a lot sooner. I just...

39:39.713 --> 39:41.256
They're your parents.

39:42.090 --> 39:43.675
I did as much as I dared.

39:46.219 --> 39:48.263
I wish I did not know.

39:48.888 --> 39:50.390
Oh, Topa...

39:51.516 --> 39:53.018
I'm so sorry.

39:53.601 --> 39:54.686
No.

39:55.103 --> 39:57.147
No, I do not mean what I say.

39:58.273 --> 39:59.774
I'm still here.

39:59.858 --> 40:02.569
If you need someone to talk to,
day or night.

40:04.654 --> 40:06.281
What do I do?

40:07.991 --> 40:10.035
You're the only person
who can answer that.

40:11.494 --> 40:15.165
But, however you choose
to process this...

40:15.248 --> 40:16.791
I'm on your side.

40:18.001 --> 40:20.962
I know many females.

40:21.046 --> 40:24.174
But, they are all from
other worlds.

40:24.924 --> 40:27.677
You... Commander Keyali...

40:27.761 --> 40:29.512
Dr. Finn...

40:30.013 --> 40:31.681
but no Moclans.

40:32.974 --> 40:34.267
I wish...

40:35.018 --> 40:36.936
I could meet a Moclan female.

40:37.562 --> 40:40.148
But, my father would
never allow it.

40:42.901 --> 40:44.652
Maybe he doesn't have to.

40:51.826 --> 40:52.744
(beeping)

40:52.827 --> 40:54.829
Access all audiovisual data

her appearance.

my parents made the choice
to allow me to remain female.

42:29.799 --> 42:32.427
They believed that
to have me altered

42:32.510 --> 42:34.679
would be an offense to nature.

42:35.430 --> 42:38.224
So, they took me far up
into the mountains,

42:38.308 --> 42:42.562
and built our family
a home in seclusion.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.482
They taught me to think.

To read.

42:46.941 --> 42:48.485
To wonder.

42:48.568 --> 42:51.946
They taught me to love

Bortus, have you
lost your mind?!

44:54.944 --> 44:57.989
Claire, is this an issue
of personal identity alone,

44:58.073 --> 44:59.282
or has Topa...?

44:59.407 --> 45:02.869
Topa has asked me
to reverse the procedure, yes.

45:02.952 --> 45:06.164
She wants her physical body
to represent its origins.

45:06.247 --> 45:08.041
And obviously that's possible.

45:08.124 --> 45:10.669
It is possible, yes.
And very simple.

45:10.752 --> 45:12.003
You are a doctor!

45:12.087 --> 45:15.256
You must realize that Topa
is too young

45:15.340 --> 45:17.092
to make this decision!

45:17.175 --> 45:18.718
Are you hearing yourself?

45:18.802 --> 45:20.428
Seriously, are you
completely oblivious

45:20.512 --> 45:21.971
to the hypocrisy of

-She was a baby!
-Doctor.

45:27.435 --> 45:30.271
Is there any psychological risk?

45:31.481 --> 45:35.026
Under normal circumstances,
I couldn't do what's being asked

45:35.110 --> 45:37.195
until the child reached
adulthood,

45:37.278 --> 45:40.740
but, to be blunt, Topa's history
makes it all a wash.

45:40.824 --> 45:42.742
It's impactful either way.

45:42.826 --> 45:45.787
So, in my professional opinion,
the tipping factor

45:45.870 --> 45:47.706
should be the wishes
of Topa herself.

45:47.789 --> 45:50.458
And, there's a very reasonable
argument

45:50.542 --> 45:53.086
that we'd simply be restoring
what was taken from her.

45:53.169 --> 45:56.381
It is immoral, and
it is illegal!

45:56.464 --> 45:58.466
On Moclus. We're
not on Moclus.

46:05.640 --> 46:07.851
Where medical issues
are concerned,

46:07.934 --> 46:11.813
Union law states that if a child
is not of legal age

46:11.896 --> 46:13.606
to make the decision
on their own,

46:13.690 --> 46:17.944
it requires the consent of
at least one parent or guardian.

46:18.028 --> 46:19.696
Doesn't require both.

46:22.073 --> 46:23.575

46:50.518 --> 46:54.773
There is another factor
that we have not discussed.

46:54.856 --> 46:56.107
I know.

46:57.525 --> 47:03.031
Even with Bortus's consent,
it may not be that simple.

47:05.742 --> 47:08.870
<i>You should know that this is</i>
<i>not something we take lightly.</i>

47:09.662 --> 47:11.581
<i>The Union council conferred</i>

47:11.664 --> 47:14.417
<i>for no less than nine hours</i>

47:14.501 --> 47:17.462
<i>But it is abundantly clear</i>
<i>that this would deeply imperil</i>

47:17.545 --> 47:19.506
<i>our relationship with</i>
<i>the Moclans.</i>

47:19.589 --> 47:20.965

Bortus has consented.

<i>I am telling you, I have been</i>

48:37.250 --> 48:40.003
<i>If we defy their custom</i>

Captain, we've hit the end

51:53.530 --> 51:55.115
It's all been mapped out
for the science team,

51:55.198 --> 51:56.658
so there shouldn't
be any surprises.

51:56.741 --> 51:58.993
I can have a detailed chart

51:59.077 --> 52:01.204
Good work. You can prep the

Aye, sir.

52:02.414 --> 52:04.082
Talla. What's the latest?

52:04.165 --> 52:05.500
All cleared, sir.

52:05.583 --> 52:07.544
We've de-fanged almost
every booby trap in the place.

52:07.627 --> 52:08.712
There are a few we can't get to

52:08.795 --> 52:10.130
without damaging the
architecture,

52:10.296 --> 52:12.173

All right, start rounding

Sir, if I can ask...
how's Topa?

52:20.056 --> 52:21.182
Not good.

52:21.266 --> 52:22.600
Will you tell her that
the entire crew

52:22.684 --> 52:23.810
is pulling for her?

52:25.020 --> 52:28.189
Captain... I had a thought.

52:28.273 --> 52:29.441
What is it?

52:29.524 --> 52:30.942
What if...

52:31.901 --> 52:33.862
What if I resigned
my commission?

52:34.738 --> 52:37.699
Admiral Howland says
that a Fleet medical officer

52:37.782 --> 52:39.200
can't do the procedure.

52:39.284 --> 52:40.410
Fine.

52:40.493 --> 52:42.454
Then I won't be a Fleet officer.

52:42.537 --> 52:44.330
I'll be a civilian doctor.

52:45.165 --> 52:46.624
Claire, that's...

52:46.708 --> 52:48.293
very noble.

52:48.376 --> 52:51.713
But you've dedicated
your entire career to the Fleet.

52:51.796 --> 52:54.883
It's not like you can do that
and just jump right back in.

52:54.966 --> 52:57.635
Your professional life
as you know it would be over.

52:57.719 --> 53:00.388
Not to mention, you'd probably
become a target for the Moclans.

53:00.472 --> 53:03.600
But it would give the Admirals
plausible deniability.

53:03.683 --> 53:04.809
Technically.

53:04.893 --> 53:06.728
And the Moclans could
remain in the Union

53:06.811 --> 53:07.937
and still save face.

53:08.021 --> 53:09.564
Again, technically.

53:09.647 --> 53:11.274
It may be enough.

53:12.776 --> 53:13.818
Look...

53:14.069 --> 53:16.321
this would have to be
entirely your decision.

53:16.404 --> 53:18.782
Every member of the crew
would have to be able

53:18.865 --> 53:20.617
to claim honestly,
under oath,

53:20.700 --> 53:23.620
that they did not aid or witness
the procedure.

53:24.496 --> 53:27.874
Claire. Are you sure
you really want to do this?

53:27.957 --> 53:29.668
You'd be saying goodbye
to the Orville.

53:29.751 --> 53:31.961
We're talking about
Topa's life.

53:32.128 --> 53:33.922
I think it's a fair trade.

53:34.005 --> 53:36.633
So I won't be a Union officer.

53:37.133 --> 53:38.468
I'll be okay.

53:38.551 --> 53:39.719
ISAAC:
<i>Excuse me, Doctor.</i>

53:40.762 --> 53:43.014
<i>I am not a Union officer.</i>

53:43.723 --> 53:44.683
What?

53:44.766 --> 53:46.559
ISAAC:
<i>I have never been commissioned.</i>

53:46.643 --> 53:48.728
<i>I came to the Orville</i>
<i>as an emissary.</i>

53:48.812 --> 53:51.189
<i>That designation has</i>
<i>never been altered.</i>

53:51.272 --> 53:52.440
What are you getting at?

53:53.024 --> 53:55.110
ISAAC:
<i>I could perform the procedure.</i>

53:55.610 --> 53:56.486
You?

53:56.569 --> 53:58.196
ISAAC:
<i>I am quite capable.</i>

53:58.279 --> 53:59.739
<i>All required medical data</i>

53:59.823 --> 54:01.741
<i>is available from the</i>
<i>ship's computer.</i>

54:01.825 --> 54:03.743
<i>I could upload it to</i>
<i>my core memory,</i>

54:03.827 --> 54:05.745
<i>along with any additional</i>
<i>specifications</i>

54:05.829 --> 54:07.330
<i>you may wish to include.</i>

54:07.914 --> 54:10.792
Isaac, you're... not a doctor.

54:10.875 --> 54:12.711
ISAAC: <i>I am an artificial</i>
<i>life form</i>

54:12.794 --> 54:15.296
<i>capable of executing</i>
<i>complex algorithms</i>

54:15.380 --> 54:17.716
<i>demanding extreme physical</i>
<i>dexterity.</i>

54:17.799 --> 54:21.011
<i>For me, there is no difference</i>
<i>between performing surgery,</i>

54:21.094 --> 54:24.472
<i>playing a piano concerto,</i>
<i>or re-aligning a scanner array.</i>

54:24.556 --> 54:28.852
<i>In effect, I can indeed</i>
<i>be... a doctor.</i>

54:30.937 --> 54:31.896
Claire?

54:33.398 --> 54:34.983
He's right.

54:39.654 --> 54:40.530
Isaac.

54:41.114 --> 54:43.950
I am officially ordering you
not to interfere.

54:44.034 --> 54:45.910
Which means if you did this,

54:45.994 --> 54:47.871
you would be doing
it on your own.

54:47.954 --> 54:49.456
Without my knowledge,

54:49.539 --> 54:52.584
and without the knowledge of any
crew member aboard the Orville.

54:52.667 --> 54:54.627
ISAAC:
<i>I understand, sir.</i>

54:54.711 --> 54:56.588
It would be...

54:56.671 --> 54:59.215
unfortunate if a member
of the crew visited sickbay

54:59.299 --> 55:01.634
during that hypothetical window.

55:02.635 --> 55:03.970
I've got an idea.

55:05.096 --> 55:06.931
(upbeat music playing)

55:12.312 --> 55:14.981
-(comm chirps)
-All hands, this is the captain.

55:15.065 --> 55:16.733
I'm pleased to inform
you there will be

55:16.816 --> 55:19.652
a very special performance
this evening in the shuttle bay.

55:19.736 --> 55:21.321
As many of you are aware,

55:21.404 --> 55:23.573
our second officer,
Commander Bortus,

55:23.656 --> 55:26.201
also happens to be a
very gifted singer.

55:26.284 --> 55:29.245
He has not thus far graced us
with his talents,

55:29.329 --> 55:31.414
<i>but tonight at 2100 hours,</i>

55:31.498 --> 55:33.708
<i>he will be performing</i>
<i>selections from</i>

55:33.792 --> 55:37.420
<i>the musical repertoires of</i>
<i>16 different Union planets.</i>

55:37.504 --> 55:38.713
If you'd care to attend,

55:38.797 --> 55:41.716
please submit a notification to
Commander Keyali.

55:47.681 --> 55:49.974
Damn. You're a hot
ticket, Bortus.

55:50.058 --> 55:52.435
I will be sure to bring my,

55:52.519 --> 55:55.313
what does Lieutenant Malloy
call it?

55:56.231 --> 55:57.315
My "A" game.

55:57.399 --> 55:58.733
There ya go, buddy.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.821
Looks to me like
we may have a full house.

56:12.247 --> 56:14.249
(upbeat music playing)

56:15.542 --> 56:17.210
(indistinct chatter)

56:58.001 --> 56:59.252
(music ends)

56:59.336 --> 57:01.338
(crowd murmuring)

57:09.637 --> 57:11.639
(applause)

57:35.955 --> 57:37.123
<i>Thank you.</i>

57:37.665 --> 57:40.960
<i>This song was taught</i>
<i>to me by Dr. Finn.</i>

57:41.044 --> 57:44.756
<i>She says it is one</i>
<i>of her favorites.</i>

57:46.841 --> 57:50.303
(playing tranquil
introduction)

57:50.387 --> 57:52.722
That key is too high!

59:53.635 --> 59:56.638

Isaac, I'm...

01:00:09.567 --> 01:00:10.944
I'm afraid.

01:00:11.027 --> 01:00:13.363
ISAAC: <i>Do you wish to abstain</i>
<i>from the procedure?</i>

01:00:13.446 --> 01:00:15.865
No. I want it.

01:00:16.366 --> 01:00:17.784
But...

01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:20.078
are you sure I will
be all right?

01:00:20.161 --> 01:00:21.830
ISAAC:
<i>I am quite certain.</i>

01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:23.248
<i>Our time is finite.</i>

01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:24.958
<i>Please disrobe.</i>

01:00:26.042 --> 01:00:27.544
I wish Dr. Finn was here.

01:00:27.627 --> 01:00:30.630
ISAAC: <i>Dr. Finn is unable</i>
<i>to perform the procedure.</i>

01:00:31.506 --> 01:00:32.799
Maybe...

01:00:33.633 --> 01:00:35.427
I would not be so nervous.

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.221
ISAAC: <i>You are referring to what</i>
<i>Dr. Finn calls</i>

01:00:38.304 --> 01:00:39.931
<i>a "bedside manner."</i>

01:00:44.269 --> 01:00:46.354
<i>I will make sure that</i>

01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:49.399
<i>You do not need to be afraid.</i>

Topa! What are you doing?!

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:06.458
-Papa...
-You will come with me at once!

01:01:06.541 --> 01:01:08.084
Get out of my way, Kaylon.

01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:10.837
ISAAC: <i>I am afraid that will</i>
<i>not be possible.</i>

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.173
<i>I will not permit you to</i>
<i>disrupt the procedure.</i>

01:01:13.256 --> 01:01:16.634
I forbid you to do this!
You will destroy him!

01:01:16.718 --> 01:01:17.969
ISAAC:
<i>That is inaccurate.</i>

01:01:18.053 --> 01:01:19.596
<i>He will be altered physically,</i>

01:01:19.679 --> 01:01:21.473
<i>but he will remain a fully</i>

01:01:21.556 --> 01:01:22.724
<i>biological organism.</i>

01:01:22.807 --> 01:01:25.060
He will be a monstrosity!

01:01:25.143 --> 01:01:27.020
ISAAC:
<i>That is also inaccurate.</i>

01:01:27.103 --> 01:01:29.647
<i>I surmise your capacity</i>

The USS Newton has assumed
synchronous orbit, Captain.

01:05:42.108 --> 01:05:43.777
Science teams are
requesting permission

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.653
to begin offloading
the artifacts.

01:05:45.737 --> 01:05:47.655
-Permission granted.
-(comm beeps)

01:05:47.739 --> 01:05:49.949
Captain, I'm receiving a message
from Admiral Howland.

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:51.910
She's arrived aboard the Newton.

01:05:51.993 --> 01:05:53.620
She'd like to meet with you and
Commander Grayson

01:05:53.703 --> 01:05:54.746
in your office.

01:06:02.545 --> 01:06:03.880
Do you have difficulty

01:06:03.963 --> 01:06:06.549
understanding
simple speech, Captain?

01:06:07.258 --> 01:06:08.677
No, sir.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.096
-Do you, Commander?
-No, sir.

01:06:11.179 --> 01:06:13.807
Yet, for some
completely mystifying reason,

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:17.102
my crystal-clear orders
were blatantly disobeyed.

01:06:17.185 --> 01:06:18.728
I take full responsibility--

01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:21.690
You will speak when
spoken to, Captain,

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.400
do you understand me?!

01:06:23.483 --> 01:06:25.276
Yes, sir, Admiral.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.071
You seem to think that your
personal judgment is more sound

01:06:28.154 --> 01:06:30.699
than the judgment
of the entire Union Council.

01:06:30.782 --> 01:06:34.119
That is a staggeringly arrogant
point of view, wouldn't you say?

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:35.787
-Yes, sir.
-What's that?

01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:36.830
Yes, sir!

01:06:37.831 --> 01:06:42.794
You ignored a decision
handed down by your superiors

01:06:42.877 --> 01:06:45.422
and committed an act
of outright disobedience,

01:06:45.505 --> 01:06:47.340
thereby jeopardizing an alliance

01:06:47.424 --> 01:06:49.509
that is one of our only barriers

01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:53.054
against annihilation
from an outside force!

01:06:53.138 --> 01:06:57.851
We were unaware the procedure
was occurring, sir.

01:06:58.727 --> 01:07:00.478
Well, then that makes
you insubordinate

01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:03.273
<i>and </i>incompetent, doesn't it?

01:07:03.815 --> 01:07:05.567
Yes, sir, it does.

01:07:07.027 --> 01:07:10.405
The Moclans are
understandably furious

01:07:10.488 --> 01:07:13.366
about this flagrant disregard
for their culture.

01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:17.454
However, they've decided
that the time is not right

01:07:17.537 --> 01:07:20.040
to withdraw their
Union membership.

01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:23.668
In addition, the fact that a
Kaylon performed the procedure

01:07:23.752 --> 01:07:26.379
has further heightened
their resolve to restrain

01:07:26.463 --> 01:07:29.049
and vanquish the Kaylon threat.

01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:33.178
Some would say that makes
your actions commendable.

01:07:34.679 --> 01:07:39.225
Well, I say you just got lucky.

01:07:39.976 --> 01:07:42.354
And if either of you ever again
step out of line,

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:44.898
and I mean so much as a wrinkle
in your uniform,

01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:48.234
or a blemish on your shoes,
you are finished!

01:07:49.235 --> 01:07:50.820
Do I make myself clear?

01:07:50.904 --> 01:07:51.988
BOTH: Yes, sir.

01:07:56.659 --> 01:07:57.619
(sighs)

01:07:58.912 --> 01:08:03.458
Please, extend my best wishes
to the Moclan girl.

01:08:22.977 --> 01:08:26.439
Klyden. You do not
have to do this.

01:08:27.065 --> 01:08:30.110
Papa. I had to.

01:08:30.193 --> 01:08:33.029
I could not live my life
the way you wanted me to.

01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:35.073
It would have been a lie.

01:08:37.742 --> 01:08:42.247
Have you no room in your heart
for tolerance?

01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:47.210
What inner fulfillment
are you enjoying

01:08:47.293 --> 01:08:49.546
from this devotion to tradition,

01:08:50.255 --> 01:08:54.676
that is so potent
it drives you from your family?

01:09:00.974 --> 01:09:02.392
TOPA: Papa.

01:09:02.475 --> 01:09:04.519
I love you.

01:09:07.772 --> 01:09:10.442
I wish you were never born.

01:10:11.419 --> 01:10:12.879
ISAAC:
<i>I am aware of that.</i>

01:10:13.588 --> 01:10:15.882
Topa's very grateful.

01:10:17.092 --> 01:10:19.469
Maybe that means something
to you?

01:10:19.552 --> 01:10:20.845
ISAAC:
<i>It does not.</i>

01:10:20.929 --> 01:10:23.014
(slight chuckle) Of course.

01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:24.849
ISAAC: <i>I did not perform</i>
<i>the procedure</i>

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:26.226
<i>for Topa's benefit.</i>

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:27.519
You...

01:10:28.561 --> 01:10:30.105
I-I don't understand.

01:10:30.188 --> 01:10:32.816
ISAAC: <i>We are both aware</i>
<i>that my presence on the ship</i>

01:10:32.899 --> 01:10:34.693
<i>is a disruptive element.</i>

01:10:34.776 --> 01:10:36.778
<i>The crew is not fond of me.</i>

01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:38.321
<i>This is understandable.</i>

01:10:38.405 --> 01:10:40.448
<i>Given their affection for Topa,</i>

01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:42.701
<i>I reasoned that by</i>
<i>assisting her,</i>

01:10:42.784 --> 01:10:45.328
<i>I could improve my standing</i>
<i>aboard the Orville.</i>

01:10:45.412 --> 01:10:47.080
<i>This would increase</i>
<i>crew efficiency</i>

01:10:47.163 --> 01:10:50.000
<i>on occasions during which</i>
<i>they must interact with me.</i>

01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:54.838
And maybe they'd like
you a little more.

01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:56.756
ISAAC:
<i>That is also possible.</i>

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:58.800
Isaac...

01:10:59.968 --> 01:11:02.804
you are the most honest
man I know.

01:11:13.106 --> 01:11:14.524
You want to have dinner?

01:11:16.026 --> 01:11:17.527
ISAAC:
<i>Very well, Doctor.</i>

01:11:28.413 --> 01:11:30.415
(inspirational music playing)

01:11:40.842 --> 01:11:43.011
-(comm beeps)
-GRAYSON: <i>Grayson to Topa.</i>

01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:47.891
-(comm beeps)
-Yes, Commander?

01:11:47.974 --> 01:11:49.768
GRAYSON:
<i>We're about to leave orbit.</i>

01:11:49.893 --> 01:11:51.144
<i>I was wondering if you'd like</i>

01:11:51.227 --> 01:11:53.229
<i>to sit in the command chair</i>
<i>for departure.</i>

01:11:54.564 --> 01:11:57.442
I... would like that, yes.

01:11:57.525 --> 01:11:59.694
GRAYSON: <i>Report to the bridge</i>
<i>on the double.</i>

01:12:00.111 --> 01:12:01.488
Yes, sir.

01:12:07.202 --> 01:12:09.746
(orchestra playing
"You'll Never Walk Alone")

01:12:41.444 --> 01:12:43.780
Have a seat, Captain.

01:13:03.133 --> 01:13:05.093
All departments
show green, sir.

01:13:05.552 --> 01:13:08.596
Course plotted and laid in.
Ready for departure.

01:13:08.847 --> 01:13:10.557
On your order, sir.

01:13:14.602 --> 01:13:16.855
Engage quantum drive.

01:13:21.526 --> 01:13:25.447
(music swelling)

01:13:59.606 --> 01:14:01.608
