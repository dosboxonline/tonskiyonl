WEBVTT

00:38.280 --> 00:42.444
Valencia, CA 2:43 AM

01:30.796 --> 01:32.263
Yeah.

01:33.198 --> 01:34.892
Shit.

01:36.068 --> 01:37.660
Where is he?

01:39.838 --> 01:41.466
Gotta go.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.633
What's the latest?

02:18.139 --> 02:21.574
- Nothing. They say the first twenty-four hours....
- Right.

02:23.144 --> 02:26.340
- Did she understand?
- It's not their fight.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.482
Did she understand?

02:29.749 --> 02:30.978
It's not their fight.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.061
- Hey.
- Hey, Linus.

02:54.340 --> 02:58.105
- Hey, where are Tess and Isabel?
- It's not their fight.

02:59.444 --> 03:00.808
Any change?

03:00.979 --> 03:04.437
He's in critical condition, but he's
still alive. You know, if he doesn't--

03:04.680 --> 03:06.946
- Is Stan there?
- Yeah, he's been there an hour.

03:07.185 --> 03:09.675
Stan'll tell us what's going on.

03:11.456 --> 03:14.186
Myocardial infarction.

03:14.526 --> 03:17.358
He's endured an incredible shock to his system.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.988
Can he recover? Yes.

03:21.365 --> 03:23.332
Will he recover?

03:24.367 --> 03:27.428
It helps if they have something to live for.

03:27.603 --> 03:29.069
Family?

03:35.376 --> 03:37.072
Friends, then.

03:38.046 --> 03:40.037
Maybe that'll be enough.

03:43.484 --> 03:47.045
Reuben, when it comes to Willy Bank,
you can't rely on contracts.

03:47.322 --> 03:49.750
My lawyers say they're ironclad.

03:50.424 --> 03:53.757
- Give me credit for my business sechel.
- I don't think it's a good idea.

03:53.928 --> 03:56.328
- Neither does Rusty.
- Well, I'm doing it. It's done.

03:56.497 --> 04:01.230
And you tell Rusty that I won't have to
pull jobs to keep my hotel solvent.

04:01.569 --> 04:02.968
Hey, Reuben.

04:03.136 --> 04:07.266
You fellas are young. You don't understand.

04:08.175 --> 04:12.338
Do you know that the Inuit people
put their elders out on a ice floe...

04:12.579 --> 04:14.944
...to die when they're too old to hunt? Thanks.

04:15.113 --> 04:16.341
That's just a myth.

04:16.515 --> 04:19.348
Well, that ain't gonna
happen to me. I can still hunt.

04:19.584 --> 04:23.282
This is it. It's my chance.
I used to mean something in this town.

04:23.455 --> 04:25.946
I would walk into a restaurant. If it was full...

04:26.123 --> 04:28.318
...they'd snap out a new table for me like that!

04:28.493 --> 04:30.686
If you're worried about your place in history...

04:30.860 --> 04:33.591
...let us get a street
named after you, or a boulevard.

04:33.763 --> 04:36.198
We can talk about that when I'm dead. Danny...

04:36.367 --> 04:40.700
...I appreciate you coming this far
to see me, but I gotta do this.

04:42.939 --> 04:45.100
- Reuben!
- Partner!

04:45.275 --> 04:48.267
Reuben! Oh, so good of you to come.

04:48.610 --> 04:51.911
Of course. Of course.
Are there more items for my punch list?

04:52.082 --> 04:54.880
I got so much energy,
I can hardly sleep from the excitement!

04:55.050 --> 04:57.109
Where are you at on the visas for the chefs?

04:57.286 --> 05:00.881
My man in Washington says
they'll be stamped by the time we open.

05:01.124 --> 05:04.615
- No, no, no. Not good enough.
- That's what I said.

05:07.960 --> 05:11.124
Oh, that's good. And the chandeliers?

05:11.466 --> 05:14.902
My ex-wife's new brother-in-law--
You don't need the details. It's done!

05:15.069 --> 05:17.229
Half price. They're already at the warehouse.

05:17.470 --> 05:20.838
And because I know it mattered to you...

05:21.009 --> 05:23.636
...I appeared before the city council.

05:23.977 --> 05:27.468
The one-way street leading
away from the rear entrance...

05:27.747 --> 05:30.842
...now leads toward the rear entrance.

05:31.018 --> 05:34.647
- All roads lead to the Midas!
- This is perfect!

05:34.920 --> 05:39.584
Great views up here.
Where's the partners' desk gonna be?

05:40.260 --> 05:41.817
Oh, no partners' desk.

05:43.160 --> 05:46.188
- Two desks?
- No two desks. One desk.

05:46.365 --> 05:49.266
One chairman's desk. One.

05:51.403 --> 05:54.496
The arrangement is changing.

05:55.706 --> 05:59.803
Was changed. As a matter
of fact, there is no arrangement.

06:01.346 --> 06:03.472
Everybody said that you would try to screw me.

06:03.646 --> 06:06.341
That you done it to every one of your partners.

06:06.683 --> 06:09.346
But I defended you. I said, "No!

06:09.687 --> 06:11.985
Me and Willy Bank been around long enough...

06:12.155 --> 06:14.180
...that we both shook Sinatra's hand.

06:14.357 --> 06:17.191
And there's a code among guys
that shook Sinatra's hand."

06:17.394 --> 06:18.621
Screw Sinatra's hand.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.195
- Screw...?
- You're dead weight.

06:22.530 --> 06:25.967
You think I'm gonna carry you
and pay you at the same time?

06:26.134 --> 06:28.695
Reuben, you're out!

06:28.870 --> 06:32.807
- Never. This is my land.
- Was. Was your land.

06:32.975 --> 06:36.034
- You signed it over to the corporation.
- For fifty percent interest!

06:36.310 --> 06:39.404
Which I'm gonna ask you to sign over to me...

06:39.580 --> 06:41.878
...for a small cash payment.

06:43.650 --> 06:45.641
I'm not signing that.

06:45.885 --> 06:48.320
Get out of here. I'm not signing that.

06:51.825 --> 06:55.488
- Are you gonna throw me off the roof?
- Well, I don't want to.

06:56.596 --> 06:59.861
This is wrong. This is all wrong.

07:04.737 --> 07:06.932
You're leaving me with nothing.

07:07.907 --> 07:11.842
You know, you're right. And it's rude.

07:14.747 --> 07:16.304
Here.

07:16.748 --> 07:18.545
It's the first batch.

07:19.017 --> 07:20.677
Just got made.

07:27.092 --> 07:28.922
You changed the name.

07:30.094 --> 07:31.457
I like it better!

07:31.928 --> 07:33.691
Don't you?

07:42.772 --> 07:44.296
Reuben.

07:44.774 --> 07:46.766
He always was too trusting.

07:47.108 --> 07:51.102
- Is, Saul. Is.
- Of course. Is.

07:52.882 --> 07:55.110
You try talking him out of it next time.

07:55.283 --> 07:57.251
Look, Bank hurt Reuben.

07:57.420 --> 08:00.479
I know how that makes me feel.
I know what that makes me wanna do.

08:00.655 --> 08:03.988
I'm gonna get close to Bank,
and I don't care if it gets messy.

08:04.159 --> 08:06.422
I'll drive you. We'll get him leaving his barber.

08:06.594 --> 08:09.563
- Then I'll inject him.
- I'll find a spot to get rid of the body.

08:09.798 --> 08:11.389
All valid ideas.

08:11.565 --> 08:13.659
Great initiative. But....

08:13.834 --> 08:18.998
But even though Bank stepped over the line,
we have to do what's best for Reuben.

08:19.172 --> 08:21.765
Which means, we offer Bank a Billy Martin.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.466
What? He goes for it,
and that's it? He just gets off?

08:24.644 --> 08:26.339
- That's the rule.
- That's the rule...

08:26.512 --> 08:29.209
...for someone who understands
the rules, which Bank don't.

08:29.382 --> 08:31.645
He already broke them.
So he don't get the chance.

08:32.484 --> 08:34.008
For Reuben...

08:35.153 --> 08:37.519
...I think we give him a chance.

08:39.758 --> 08:43.419
I need answers before
I ask questions. You get that?

08:43.594 --> 08:45.322
All right, do it.

08:46.930 --> 08:51.799
So some guys I take seriously...

08:51.968 --> 08:55.962
- ...told me you're a serious guy.
- Good.

08:56.339 --> 08:59.001
What I want, what's most important to me...

08:59.175 --> 09:02.633
...is that Reuben gets his
share of the hotel restored.

09:02.812 --> 09:06.611
- I'm here to give you a chance to do that.
- Oh, you're gonna give me a chance?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.915
Okay.

09:12.020 --> 09:15.614
It's a Billy Martin? I pass.

09:15.790 --> 09:18.224
Last time I looked--
And I look every morning.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.052
--it was my name listed as owner...

09:20.227 --> 09:24.027
...on more valuable property in this
state than anyone else in history.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.963
- Which means you got a lot more to lose.
- Well, I don't lose.

09:28.468 --> 09:32.302
People who bet on me to lose lose, and they lose big.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.697
You come at me, you better know I move quick...

09:35.976 --> 09:39.309
...and when I do, I slice like a goddamn hammer.

09:40.045 --> 09:42.014
So you're not gonna make Reuben whole?

09:42.182 --> 09:45.548
If Reuben was too weak or too stupid
to see what was coming down...

09:45.818 --> 09:48.651
...then you know what?
He doesn't belong here.

09:48.888 --> 09:54.383
He's made the right choice:
Roll over and die. Let him be.

09:59.998 --> 10:02.158
How long do I have to wait for a conduit?

10:02.732 --> 10:05.998
I don't want the labor pains.
I just want the baby.

10:06.270 --> 10:10.866
Six months later...

10:39.868 --> 10:41.927
Well, thanks for coming.

10:42.770 --> 10:44.135
Thanks for the hundred grand.

10:44.305 --> 10:48.503
If this takes longer than a day, though,
we're gonna have to renegotiate.

10:48.676 --> 10:50.371
That's fair.

10:50.543 --> 10:53.877
I'd like some sencha or genmaicha.

10:54.114 --> 10:55.775
Green tea. Yes, sir.

10:56.050 --> 11:00.042
And don't burn it. Pour it just
before boiling point, not after.

11:00.287 --> 11:02.982
Green tea. Si, signore.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.290
Just us three?

11:07.627 --> 11:10.460
- For now, we figured--
- Figured we'd talk to you first.

11:10.630 --> 11:14.690
- Good Lord. How stuck are you?
- Stuck.

11:14.867 --> 11:17.300
- Stalled, really.
- Stuck.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.128
Run it for me.

11:20.638 --> 11:24.233
Don't leave anything out.
Give me the big picture.

11:24.576 --> 11:26.407
- You wanna--?
- It's all yours.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.509
- Where should we start?
- With the hotel.

11:39.322 --> 11:41.653
Bank's swinging for the fences on this one.

11:41.825 --> 11:45.488
Forget weekenders and conventioneers.
He's built this place for whales.

11:45.662 --> 11:49.598
It's a shoo-in for the Five Diamond award.
The marble was handpicked in Italy.

11:49.766 --> 11:53.633
The chefs stolen from the highest-rated
restaurants in the Michelin guide book.

11:54.503 --> 11:58.667
In the villas, for his big players,
the silverware is actually gold.

12:00.109 --> 12:03.168
Bank's greatest strength
is also his weakness: ego.

12:03.444 --> 12:07.176
He's been spending his days checking
and rechecking every inch of the property...

12:07.348 --> 12:09.475
...getting ready for the grand opening.

12:09.652 --> 12:11.117
It's a compulsion.

12:12.552 --> 12:15.521
Bank's right-hand man is a woman: Abigail Sponder.

12:15.789 --> 12:18.622
We're gonna have to let you go.
Turn in your uniform.

12:18.792 --> 12:20.851
I only gained four pounds. You can't.

12:21.029 --> 12:23.462
Your body mass index is not
what it's supposed to be.

12:23.630 --> 12:25.564
- But Ms. Sponder--
- Oh, no, baby doll.

12:25.732 --> 12:28.030
It's your butt that's the problem.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.329
You can't fire no waitress based on appearance.

12:32.505 --> 12:35.166
- That's just unconstitutional.
- If they were waitresses.

12:35.340 --> 12:37.468
They're actually hired as "models who serve"...

12:37.643 --> 12:40.043
...so Bank can monitor their physical appearance.

12:40.212 --> 12:41.543
It's a cruel, cruel practice.

12:41.713 --> 12:43.840
Between Bank and Sponder, the place is covered.

12:44.016 --> 12:46.382
- When's opening night?
- July third.

12:46.650 --> 12:50.381
Got fireworks at the stroke
of midnight. The whole shebang.

12:50.722 --> 12:52.781
We're going in now? It's already open.

12:52.957 --> 12:55.891
It's a soft opening, to test
the place before the grand opening.

12:56.060 --> 12:58.824
It's kind of like an
out-of-town preview, only it's in town.

12:59.063 --> 13:02.123
Soft opening, grand opening.
When they opened the Flamingo...

13:02.299 --> 13:06.066
...one day it was closed, the next
day it was open. End of story.

13:06.570 --> 13:08.901
- I know, I was there.
- Well, it's different now.

13:09.172 --> 13:11.902
- So when is opening night?
- July third.

13:12.408 --> 13:16.401
Now, the top casinos can clear three
million dollars a day just on the floor.

13:16.745 --> 13:20.442
Bank, with his high-level players
and no limits, is projecting five.

13:20.615 --> 13:24.278
But in exchange for the loans, he had to
give up six of the nine seats on the board.

13:24.453 --> 13:27.911
He doesn't control his company, and
a couple of the guys aren't friendlies.

13:28.090 --> 13:30.751
So he has to clear five hundred
million in the first quarter...

13:30.926 --> 13:33.086
...or he gets dumped out of his own hotel.

13:33.860 --> 13:37.855
And, of course, Bank wants another
Five Diamond Award. Fifth in a row.

13:38.099 --> 13:43.093
Every hotel I have ever owned has won
a Royal Review Five Diamond Award.

13:43.370 --> 13:45.303
The Saguaro Inn, five diamonds.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.770
The Peloponnesian, Monte Carlo, five diamonds.

13:47.940 --> 13:52.537
The Grand Sapphire, Singapore, cinco diamantes!

13:52.712 --> 13:55.340
The Otemanu Crest, Tahiti....

13:56.950 --> 13:58.281
I've never not won one.

13:58.950 --> 14:01.613
- So how are you gonna get the diamonds?
- We're not.

14:01.787 --> 14:03.845
We thought about it, then we decided it was--

14:04.020 --> 14:05.455
Impossible.

14:05.624 --> 14:08.491
But he's not gonna be winning
any more. Tell him about Debbie.

14:08.659 --> 14:09.922
Yeah, tell me about Debbie.

14:10.095 --> 14:14.464
Debbie is concierge at The Bank.
She's very ambitious...

14:14.799 --> 14:16.960
...in a good way, for us.

14:17.302 --> 14:20.269
As soon as I said the words
"general manager" and "Macao"...

14:20.437 --> 14:24.636
...she was in. I put a cherry on top to make sure.

14:25.842 --> 14:27.742
We found out who'd be reviewing the hotel.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.971
We're gonna get to him before Bank can.

14:30.312 --> 14:32.304
I feel bad. It's like torture.

14:33.416 --> 14:37.478
This is war, kid. There's
gonna be collateral damage.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.585
And he gets the
Susan B. Anthony at the airport.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.656
- He doesn't know that.
- So what?

14:42.825 --> 14:44.987
He has to know why he won to enjoy it?

14:45.160 --> 14:48.426
- Who says?
- So you'd go through that for ten million?

14:48.663 --> 14:51.656
No. I'd do it for eleven mil.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.274
Now, we've found out Bank is tapped
into the federal fingerprint database.

15:03.510 --> 15:05.103
Highly illegal.

15:06.113 --> 15:09.605
We came up with a way to piggyback
his system between firewall checks.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.776
- Very interesting stuff out there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else?

15:13.020 --> 15:14.851
We're gonna get his whales.

15:15.189 --> 15:18.351
- How?
- He talked to Denny Shields.

15:18.624 --> 15:22.560
Denny Shields? After he bragged
about you guys to Toulour...

15:22.729 --> 15:25.457
- ...and started that whole slog?
- We need him.

15:25.630 --> 15:27.098
I should've kept my mouth shut.

15:27.267 --> 15:30.258
And then I saw that guy walking
around. I didn't know who he was.

15:30.437 --> 15:33.200
He was just some guy to me.
And I guess I pissed him off.

15:33.372 --> 15:36.737
Denny, there's no way you could've
known who he was, so just forget it.

15:36.906 --> 15:38.135
It's okay. Let it go.

15:38.309 --> 15:42.871
Well, the other stuff I got taken care of
is all straight. I got eighteen whales.

15:43.148 --> 15:47.551
I spoke to their handlers, I spoke to their
managers, I spoke to their assistants.

15:47.818 --> 15:50.982
Every one of them's gonna leave.
We're gonna do it in two tiers.

15:51.223 --> 15:54.157
- I'm gonna leave first. They're gonna follow.
- Great.

15:54.324 --> 15:57.725
Okay. But you gotta make sure they win,
because these guys usually lose.

15:58.060 --> 16:01.588
- And when they lose, they get comped.
- They're gonna win big.

16:01.764 --> 16:03.232
- How big?
- Five hundred.

16:03.498 --> 16:05.764
- Million? That night? Just the group of you?
- No.

16:05.935 --> 16:08.802
- No, it's a reverse big store.
- Right.

16:08.972 --> 16:11.769
- Doesn't matter if we win.
- As long as the casino loses, yes.

16:11.939 --> 16:14.842
That could actually work. So you need to rig--

16:15.077 --> 16:17.341
Craps, blackjack, roulette, slots.

16:18.846 --> 16:21.873
Now this polymer reacts to ultrasonic pulses.

16:22.050 --> 16:25.246
But it's not metallic, so the compasses
on the table won't detect it.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.511
And it don't affect the weight
when they mike the dice. Now, this....

16:30.023 --> 16:32.014
Not really a lighter?

16:34.095 --> 16:37.189
Dice are controlled from the
manufacturer all the way to the floor.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.356
Which is why we went all
the way to the manufacturer.

16:59.150 --> 17:01.880
<i>You think they could kick
on the air conditioning?</i>

17:16.034 --> 17:17.397
<i>It's dangerous.</i>

17:17.567 --> 17:18.965
Put your mask back on.

17:21.569 --> 17:24.267
<i>Danger is my middle name.</i>

17:27.376 --> 17:31.039
So that's not your problem.
So you're jammed on blackjack?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.544
We've embedded Livingston
in the Shuffle company.

17:33.716 --> 17:37.174
The tack will stimulate your EKG
much in the same way a lie would.

17:37.352 --> 17:40.015
But you have to step on it
during the control questions...

17:40.190 --> 17:41.520
...name, birthdate, so on...

17:41.690 --> 17:44.920
...so those levels will match the
stress levels of your false answers.

17:45.093 --> 17:47.152
Got it. How much is this gonna hurt?

17:47.396 --> 17:49.795
If you're doing it right,
should be excruciating.

17:49.965 --> 17:55.062
- Is your birthdate February 11th, 1965?
- Yes.

17:55.403 --> 17:58.736
- Are you wearing a white shirt?
- Yes.

17:59.007 --> 18:01.997
Have you ever been involved
in the commission of a crime?

18:03.076 --> 18:04.338
No.

18:04.577 --> 18:08.513
Have you ever defrauded or attempted
to defraud the gaming industry?

18:09.615 --> 18:10.877
No.

18:11.050 --> 18:13.484
- Alex?
- Solid.

18:13.786 --> 18:15.252
I love technology.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.012
To look at you, I'd swear
you were being evasive...

18:18.190 --> 18:20.658
...but the machine says you're clean.

18:20.826 --> 18:24.420
I'm just a little nervous.
I really want this job.

18:25.430 --> 18:28.763
Well, you can relax now.
Welcome to Shuffle Royale.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.965
The Shuffle Royale.

18:31.136 --> 18:33.366
Well, I doubt I've heard
the last of that one.

18:34.106 --> 18:39.098
So if blackjack is not your
problem, it must be slots.

18:39.377 --> 18:42.402
Progressives run off computer chips now.

18:42.613 --> 18:45.548
You're gonna have to
program in a trap door.

18:46.383 --> 18:48.579
I can probably find you someone to do that.

18:48.753 --> 18:49.980
Thanks, Roman.

18:50.152 --> 18:53.179
We got somebody on the inside.
A great kid named Eugene.

18:53.356 --> 18:55.085
He's got a little too much downtime.

18:55.358 --> 18:57.087
He's run up a nice online gaming tab.

18:57.259 --> 18:59.954
He won't be able to keep it
a secret much longer.

19:00.129 --> 19:04.064
Now I have no.... Yeah, it's crazy.

19:04.233 --> 19:09.568
- How bad is it?
- It's bad. I owe $30,000.

19:09.737 --> 19:12.605
- So it may as well be a hundred.
- All right.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.342
Let's call it a hundred.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.272
Thanks, Danny.

19:19.447 --> 19:23.110
Eugene, my pleasure. Now tell me how
you're gonna program that trap door.

19:23.383 --> 19:26.444
So if that's not the problem,
it must be roulette.

19:26.620 --> 19:29.385
Cutting edge in that game
is infrared scanner in the shoe...

19:29.556 --> 19:32.117
...wired to a microcomputer
somewhere on your person...

19:32.293 --> 19:35.955
...which figures the probability of where
the wheels will land to three digits.

19:36.129 --> 19:38.652
Yeah, we tried that.

19:42.868 --> 19:45.029
The way he was dressed didn't help.

19:45.203 --> 19:47.535
Not very subtle, this guy.

19:49.809 --> 19:51.333
- So you're stuck on roulette.
- No.

19:51.510 --> 19:54.569
We're going lo-fi. We figured we'd
get some loaded balls in there.

19:54.746 --> 19:56.645
You're kidding.
How are you gonna deliver?

19:56.814 --> 20:00.250
Two stages. First, we
position a man of our own.

20:00.484 --> 20:02.919
There's a gaming expo the
day of the grand opening...

20:03.088 --> 20:06.649
...which Bank is committed to attend,
to show what a regular guy he is.

20:06.825 --> 20:08.452
Frank's suiting up as the gamer.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.492
The men who make the decisions
are very, very hard to impress.

20:11.660 --> 20:14.859
That's why I'm asking each and
every one of you to help me sell it...

20:15.032 --> 20:20.663
... by being the most classy, genteel ladies.

20:21.004 --> 20:25.771
The image that we're looking
for is a tasteful elegance.

20:27.776 --> 20:31.576
- What exactly do you want us to do?
- Raise those skirts up about three inches.

20:32.179 --> 20:36.844
Second part: We tie Frank to one of
theirs, a pit boss with sticky fingers.

20:37.953 --> 20:39.283
How much for these?

20:45.293 --> 20:49.023
Does Willy Bank know you're
stealing his gold flatware, Neil?

20:50.197 --> 20:51.458
How do you know my name?

20:52.867 --> 20:54.959
Oh, we know a lot of names.

20:55.369 --> 21:00.465
Know your wife, Mary,
your kids, Leanne and Dolly.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.206
We know you're the pit boss at the casino.

21:03.476 --> 21:05.307
Come on, you don't wanna.... Please!

21:05.546 --> 21:07.512
We don't wanna hurt you. We wanna help you.

21:07.679 --> 21:10.204
We want to double your salary all in one night.

21:12.385 --> 21:13.715
What do you need me to do?

21:13.986 --> 21:15.977
Right now, nothing. Go home, do your job...

21:16.155 --> 21:19.487
...and at the appropriate moment,
somebody will present themself to you.

21:19.658 --> 21:21.488
- Enough said?
- Enough said.

21:21.659 --> 21:25.060
Who is the shill at the expo to rope Bank?

21:25.328 --> 21:27.320
- We're still looking.
- We'll find someone.

21:27.564 --> 21:29.828
Make sure it's someone he really despises.

21:30.734 --> 21:35.229
Back to macro. What is your exit strategy?

21:37.073 --> 21:41.305
The players won't be in on the scam,
so they'll all think it's their lucky night.

21:41.478 --> 21:44.379
But you'll never get them out
the door with all their winnings.

21:44.548 --> 21:48.348
They'll dump it all back.
That's Vegas, and that's your problem.

21:48.584 --> 21:51.918
Well, the exit strategy is a
problem, it's not the problem.

21:52.255 --> 21:54.985
The problem is security.
We're drawing a blank.

21:55.158 --> 21:56.886
And it's a little spooky.

21:57.059 --> 22:00.495
The specs aren't on the gray market,
the black market or any other market.

22:00.663 --> 22:03.062
All I hear is there's
never been a system like this.

22:03.230 --> 22:06.358
I found out where they designed it,
but I can't get in the building.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.660
I've blown all my buy money, my bribe money...

22:08.835 --> 22:11.134
...four of my best IDs, and I am nowhere.

22:11.306 --> 22:14.035
Not only am I nowhere, I'm
pretty sure I'm being followed.

22:14.274 --> 22:16.435
- Do you have anything?
- I think I have a name.

22:16.610 --> 22:19.044
I don't even know if it's right.
They're calling it--

22:19.214 --> 22:22.704
The Greco. The Greco Player Tracker.

22:23.783 --> 22:25.615
They're putting it in Vegas.

22:27.787 --> 22:30.985
- Well, I'll give you back the hundred grand.
- Why?

22:32.290 --> 22:35.259
Danny, I like you.

22:35.428 --> 22:38.296
And you, Rusty. I mean, you got style.

22:38.630 --> 22:41.656
You got brio. You got loyalty.

22:42.467 --> 22:45.164
You two are the Morecambe and
Wise of the thievery world...

22:45.337 --> 22:46.964
...but even they went off the boil.

22:47.239 --> 22:49.730
You're analog players in a digital world.

22:51.076 --> 22:52.633
You're done.

22:54.144 --> 22:59.672
Believe me, I would love to go
up against Greco, and crush him...

23:00.750 --> 23:02.308
...but it can't be beat.

23:02.986 --> 23:05.979
It can't be hacked, and it can't be beat.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.914
Not even by you?

23:08.324 --> 23:13.318
With eighteen months, nothing else on my
plate, no other jobs, women or distractions...

23:14.063 --> 23:15.325
...maybe.

23:15.665 --> 23:17.427
You know everything about this thing.

23:17.667 --> 23:21.534
Everything except where it was being deployed.

23:21.703 --> 23:24.171
The inventor is an old schoolmate of mine.

23:24.507 --> 23:27.237
His name is Greco Montgomery.

23:27.409 --> 23:29.843
Pompous ass named it after himself.

23:30.846 --> 23:33.838
Greco? Roman?

23:34.016 --> 23:36.950
You've obviously never served
time in a British boarding school.

23:37.184 --> 23:39.175
So, what's so tough about this thing?

23:39.520 --> 23:43.684
It's an artificial-intelligence security system.

23:44.125 --> 23:47.958
- They must be field testing.
- You mean it has a brain?

23:48.529 --> 23:50.655
A hell of a brain.

23:51.532 --> 23:54.694
It doesn't only think, it reasons.

23:54.867 --> 23:58.633
It reads every permutation in every wager
in every seat in the entire casino...

23:58.805 --> 24:00.033
...hand by hand.

24:00.370 --> 24:05.002
It's wired into floor security cameras
that measure pupil dilation and determine...

24:05.177 --> 24:08.112
...if a win is legitimate or expected.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.716
It gathers biofeedback, players'
heart rates, body temperatures.

24:12.549 --> 24:15.348
It measures on a second-by-second basis...

24:15.520 --> 24:19.115
...whether the standard variations
of gaming algorithm are holding...

24:19.290 --> 24:23.351
...or are being manipulated.
The data is analyzed in real time...

24:23.529 --> 24:25.723
...in a field of exabytes.

24:26.565 --> 24:27.656
Exabytes?

24:27.830 --> 24:30.163
- You know what a terabyte is?
- Yeah, it's a....

24:30.399 --> 24:33.232
- An exabyte is a million terabytes.
- Right.

24:33.502 --> 24:36.561
The Greco is housed in an impregnable room.

24:36.839 --> 24:39.330
Shock-mounted, temperature-controlled...

24:39.574 --> 24:43.408
...and it locks down if it
even senses it is under attack.

24:43.746 --> 24:47.078
If it locks down, they wouldn't even
be able to get out of the room.

24:47.350 --> 24:50.840
Couldn't we just shut it off?
You know, cut the wires?

24:51.250 --> 24:52.617
That could work.

24:52.786 --> 24:55.482
- Better still, kick the plug out at the socket.
- Seriously.

24:55.655 --> 24:59.217
Short of walking into that room with
a bloody magnetron around your neck....

24:59.393 --> 25:01.554
You know what a magnetron is?

25:02.196 --> 25:04.757
Something that screws up the Greco?

25:05.934 --> 25:08.059
Short of that....

25:09.268 --> 25:13.170
I'm kind of shocked this is where
we are, because this is a problem.

25:13.340 --> 25:14.567
That's what I said.

25:14.740 --> 25:17.140
- If we could somehow shut it off--
- There's no "if".

25:17.310 --> 25:18.866
It cannot be shut off.

25:19.110 --> 25:21.909
You'd need a real natural
disaster, an actual act of God.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.945
- But if we could beat it--
- You can't.

25:24.116 --> 25:25.378
- But if we did--
- You can't.

25:25.616 --> 25:28.881
- You could.
- Don't flatter.

25:29.286 --> 25:32.449
If we could, how long would it take to reboot?

25:32.790 --> 25:36.226
Because it's so sophisticated,
three and a half minutes.

25:36.794 --> 25:40.059
- Might be enough.
- Pick your natural disaster.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.089
Get me a laptop.

25:45.568 --> 25:49.560
The drill accesses through
a sewer main off Paris Drive.

25:49.806 --> 25:53.969
It grinds along into the northwest
corner of the hotel, here.

25:54.310 --> 25:57.404
Probably about six rpm, so you
won't wake all the neighbors.

25:58.314 --> 26:03.307
When it reaches the resonant frequency,
the building acts like a tuning fork.

26:04.087 --> 26:07.077
To people inside, it will feel like an earthquake.

26:08.156 --> 26:14.493
That should knock out the Greco.
And that's your exit strategy.

26:44.023 --> 26:46.287
- Hey, Bash!
- I'm up here!

26:49.495 --> 26:50.929
Hey.

26:51.196 --> 26:53.960
- Here you go. Okay.
- Great.

26:54.365 --> 26:57.129
Hey, where are the mags?

26:57.800 --> 26:59.962
- Linus....
- Look, I can't buy those things.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.933
I need them! I can't leave. Why are you such a--?

27:03.106 --> 27:06.303
I'm sorry! Ask somebody else. Ask Livingston.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.306
You're such a wowser.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.777
Look.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.478
Read this to Reuben.

27:17.888 --> 27:21.220
I've done research.
Positive messages get through.

27:21.657 --> 27:22.987
I can't say this.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.490
No, I'm saying it. You're just the vessel.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.719
Come on, Basher. Why don't you take a break?

27:27.896 --> 27:31.389
I'll watch all the equipment,
and you go read it to him.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.968
Shit! You know, when
they were digging the tunnel...

27:35.136 --> 27:37.400
...they had teams of guys monitoring this.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.733
Yeah? How many?

27:41.244 --> 27:42.709
Teams!

27:47.248 --> 27:48.909
That's a 5.6.

27:49.249 --> 27:52.151
If you don't think a 5.6
is possible, or even likely...

27:52.319 --> 27:55.913
...then quite frankly, you don't know
much about the Billups-Mancini Report...

27:56.089 --> 27:58.955
...specifically the section on the Mojave Block.

27:59.425 --> 28:03.259
I know what you're hoping: that it'll
just be a blind thrust fault. It'll just....

28:03.428 --> 28:05.362
See that? That's Rusty. See Rusty?

28:05.532 --> 28:09.627
He's doing an Irwin Allen. See that?

28:10.103 --> 28:12.195
He's not deaf, Linus.

28:12.570 --> 28:16.529
- Bottom-line me here.
- Close your hotel, permanently.

28:16.708 --> 28:21.111
- What? We haven't even opened yet.
- What are all those people downstairs?

28:21.279 --> 28:23.578
- A soft open.
- It's like an out-of-town preview.

28:23.749 --> 28:26.650
You think you can just come in
here, tell me to close my hotel?

28:26.818 --> 28:28.250
I'm not gonna close my hotel.

28:28.419 --> 28:32.411
If you'll let me come in with my team
for a few days, I can prove what I'm saying.

28:32.588 --> 28:35.955
There is no way we are exposing
our exclusive clientele to a bunch of--

28:36.125 --> 28:39.185
Scientists? We wouldn't want that, would we?

28:39.362 --> 28:43.423
Let's just hope for the best,
shall we? That should be enough.

28:46.136 --> 28:49.626
Take this. It's a standard torsion seismograph.

28:49.904 --> 28:54.706
If there is a foreshock, it will register,
and you just might have time to evacuate.

28:54.877 --> 28:57.311
I don't want this thing on my desk.

28:57.478 --> 29:01.245
Let me tell you what you don't want:
your hotel on the cover of TIME magazine...

29:01.417 --> 29:05.319
...in a twisted heap of steel and glass,
you and your customers are underneath it.

29:05.486 --> 29:08.511
Headline reads, "Who's to Blame?"

29:08.855 --> 29:12.154
- That's what you don't want.
- Okay.

29:13.994 --> 29:16.486
Put an evacuation plan on paper.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.764
Will do, sir. Consider it done.

29:18.932 --> 29:21.162
I do thank you for your time.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.493
If you wanna put yourself to good
use, why don't you hit the tables?

29:25.670 --> 29:29.107
Oh, I don't gamble, sir. Neither
should you, not with people's lives.

29:29.340 --> 29:34.574
I'll screen the meetings more
carefully next time. Sorry, Mr. Bank.

29:38.450 --> 29:40.681
And now we have a camera in Bank's office.

29:47.525 --> 29:49.549
I'll see you, Reuben.

30:00.538 --> 30:02.561
A letter from Basher.

30:06.043 --> 30:07.374
"Dear Reuben.

30:08.210 --> 30:11.669
As the band said, 'Two hearts beat as one.'

30:11.848 --> 30:14.509
When men have been in battle
together, they are bonded...

30:14.683 --> 30:19.314
...like the flower and the soil and the
sun. And like the moon catches the light--"

30:19.489 --> 30:22.149
Reuben, I'm gonna go ahead on and leave this...

30:23.024 --> 30:24.753
...here.

30:28.228 --> 30:29.890
I'll see you, pal.

30:39.740 --> 30:41.570
So she says, "What'd I do?"

30:41.740 --> 30:44.835
And I said, "What do I look like, a pancake eater?"

30:45.245 --> 30:48.043
- So you just left it there on the floor?
- Right on the floor.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.409
- For how long?
- Next morning.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.217
Good.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.053
Yeah.

30:58.257 --> 31:01.384
Thanks, Debbie. Pack your swimsuit.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.317
All right.

32:39.016 --> 32:41.985
I don't wanna see any slack
faces in the front of the house.

32:42.153 --> 32:46.021
- Only happy faces. No slack faces.
- Right.

32:46.190 --> 32:48.953
- Go! Go, go!
- Right.

32:55.697 --> 32:57.495
I'm sorry.

33:06.042 --> 33:08.009
- Mr. Shields!
- Thanks.

33:08.176 --> 33:11.270
Where are you going? We got
you booked through grand opening.

33:11.446 --> 33:14.347
A friend of mine, a very serious man...

33:14.516 --> 33:18.043
...told me very seriously that it would
be a good idea if I left the hotel.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.048
I'm taking his suggestion, Willy.

33:20.389 --> 33:24.154
He can't be too serious if he
knew what I got in store for you.

33:24.392 --> 33:25.722
Willy, I'm out of here.

33:25.892 --> 33:27.382
- Oh, come on.
- See you, Willy.

33:27.660 --> 33:30.959
- I really hate to see you go, man.
- Let's go.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.662
Bank here.

33:37.570 --> 33:39.299
Confirmed?

33:43.076 --> 33:46.237
- Where?
- The gentleman in the trilby, sir.

33:46.744 --> 33:48.372
The what?

33:49.416 --> 33:51.348
The Dr. Dolittle hat.

33:51.517 --> 33:53.748
Well, why didn't you just say that?

33:54.886 --> 33:56.445
Okay.

33:57.089 --> 33:58.612
Okay.

33:59.592 --> 34:01.254
Yes, sir.

34:09.266 --> 34:14.168
- Excuse me, Mr...?
- Chubb, Kensington Chubb.

34:14.337 --> 34:18.274
Mr. Chubb, would you like to follow me?
I think I might be able to move things along.

34:18.440 --> 34:21.603
How very nice of you. No, no, no.

34:21.944 --> 34:24.435
Her Highness is a very delicate animal.

34:24.780 --> 34:28.648
It upsets her so if anyone
but Papa carries her about.

34:28.817 --> 34:32.947
- All's well, dear.
- Why don't you just follow me?

34:33.121 --> 34:37.456
You're very considerate. I do
appreciate what you're doing for me.

34:37.927 --> 34:38.916
Oh, sorry.

34:39.094 --> 34:40.617
- Why does he get to go--?
- He's a VIP.

34:40.793 --> 34:45.960
So, what's that make me? A VUP?
A very unimportant person?

34:50.472 --> 34:52.666
I have a reservation.

34:56.076 --> 34:58.873
Why don't you go on break, Jim?
I'll handle this guest.

34:59.046 --> 35:01.445
Hello, sir. Sorry for the
wait. Welcome to The Bank.

35:18.330 --> 35:20.490
Hello. Kensington Chubb here.

35:20.832 --> 35:25.826
- Saul, it's me. He's in his room. Blast him.
- Got it.

35:26.338 --> 35:28.498
Gloves and mask. Don't take any chances.

35:28.774 --> 35:30.002
Got it.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.478
Hello. Front desk.

36:13.914 --> 36:20.320
Yes, I'm in room 1706, and there's
some sort of terrible smell in here.

36:20.487 --> 36:24.549
It smells like.... Well, I need to move.

36:24.726 --> 36:27.559
Certainly, sir. I'll see if
we have anything available.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.832
I'm sorry, sir. We are booked
through the grand opening gala.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.830
I'll let you know if anything opens up.

36:36.402 --> 36:39.063
- Enjoy your stay at The Bank. Goodbye.
- But I--

36:46.710 --> 36:51.239
Let the VIP concierge know
that I'm ready to see all available rooms.

36:51.416 --> 36:53.406
- Right away, Mr. Chubb.
- Thank you.

36:53.585 --> 36:58.021
Her Highness is so very sensitive to smells.

37:01.925 --> 37:03.222
<i>If you keep complaining...</i>

37:03.528 --> 37:06.122
<i>...they will fire us all just for listening.</i>

37:06.764 --> 37:10.290
<i>I'm just saying the conditions are brutal.</i>

37:11.800 --> 37:14.566
<i>You can't disagree.</i>

37:17.140 --> 37:19.132
<i>The money -- little.</i>

37:19.542 --> 37:21.066
<i>The hours -- way too long.</i>

37:21.545 --> 37:23.137
<i>That's Mexico, bro.</i>

37:26.448 --> 37:31.852
<i>Have all of you forgotten Zapata?</i>

37:32.220 --> 37:34.313
<i>When the poor had their land stolen...</i>

37:34.489 --> 37:37.981
<i>...they figured it was lost for good.</i>

37:39.126 --> 37:41.095
<i>But Zapata said to them...</i>

37:41.696 --> 37:44.527
<i>It is better to die on your feet...</i>

37:44.698 --> 37:48.098
<i>...than to live on your knees.</i>

37:49.837 --> 37:51.532
<i>And they fought.</i>

37:53.074 --> 37:54.506
<i>And they fought.</i>

38:10.489 --> 38:15.482
Hello. I'd like a table for one.
I hear your risotto is tremendous.

38:15.828 --> 38:18.660
It is tremendous. The name on the reservation?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.793
I'm a walk-in.

38:21.832 --> 38:24.324
I'm sorry, sir. I can't accommodate you.

38:27.004 --> 38:30.404
Those are reserved. May I recommend
one of our other restaurants?

38:30.574 --> 38:34.977
Ling Su. Cantonese-inspired Szechuan cuisine.

38:35.178 --> 38:36.806
Great.

39:02.936 --> 39:06.099
Okay, it is not a prop for prop's sake.

39:07.207 --> 39:09.607
No, the Brody can work.

39:10.178 --> 39:13.341
Just because you have the
greatest cover known to man...

39:13.514 --> 39:17.382
...you don't even have to think about these
things anymore? Right. Congratulations.

39:18.886 --> 39:21.217
No, maybe you're getting soft.

39:21.555 --> 39:23.715
No, I'm not gonna put Danny on.

39:24.123 --> 39:25.784
Or Rusty.

39:27.627 --> 39:29.562
Just-- Goodbye, Dad.

39:30.964 --> 39:35.455
Okay. I rerouted all the impulses
going to the main randomizer.

39:35.634 --> 39:39.593
In blackjack, the best score
you can get is twenty-one.

39:39.770 --> 39:42.332
It's called blackjack.
So the result should be...

39:42.507 --> 39:48.468
...twenties and blackjacks to all
the players, with a dealer "bust".

39:52.650 --> 39:54.242
Your cards. That's mine.

40:01.824 --> 40:04.157
Okay, do over. Do over.

40:17.339 --> 40:19.705
Okay, I'll keep working.

40:21.177 --> 40:23.576
- Good.
- Good.

40:24.513 --> 40:27.744
I'll have the dumplings and
the shiitake-mushroom tempura.

40:27.916 --> 40:30.247
- And a sparkling water.
- Okay.

41:16.726 --> 41:18.388
I'm gonna finish this.

41:22.899 --> 41:24.729
"Staff.

41:25.568 --> 41:27.331
Casino.

41:27.900 --> 41:29.563
Food.

41:30.072 --> 41:32.335
Room cleanliness."

42:09.442 --> 42:12.002
At this point, there's
nothing I can do to help him.

42:12.178 --> 42:15.011
You said that he'd be,
whatchamacallit, ambulatory by now.

42:15.546 --> 42:18.208
- Are you keeping his spirits buoyed?
- We're working on it.

42:18.383 --> 42:19.940
Thanks, Stan.

42:21.118 --> 42:24.952
No, no. That's way too much.
It's not like I removed a bullet.

42:25.222 --> 42:26.916
This time.

42:29.659 --> 42:31.958
- Hey, Linus. How's it going?
- Dr. Stan. Great.

42:32.229 --> 42:33.457
- We're dead.
- What?

42:33.630 --> 42:35.826
- The factory in Mexico is offline.
- Offline?

42:36.000 --> 42:39.457
- What does that mean exactly?
- I couldn't get details. It just shut down.

42:39.736 --> 42:42.398
- You don't think that he...?
- Yeah, I do.

43:02.323 --> 43:05.985
So he says that they want their
bread and they want their roses too.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.423
You gotta get down there
and straighten this out.

43:08.662 --> 43:10.755
- But he doesn't listen to me.
- You're going.

43:10.932 --> 43:15.892
If we don't get this factory back online,
we're gonna have to dock this showboat.

43:18.438 --> 43:20.565
What he means is the whole operation hinges--

43:20.740 --> 43:24.609
Dude, I got the showboat
metaphor. Thank you, Linus.

43:24.978 --> 43:28.174
- All right, I gotta get back.
- What?

43:28.515 --> 43:31.814
What do you mean, what?
A little something for the effort, maybe.

43:32.518 --> 43:35.078
We pool tips! The other guys
are gonna think I'm kiting.

43:35.254 --> 43:37.118
All right, okay, fine. Come on.

43:37.355 --> 43:40.882
- You want it to come out of my pocket?
- I ain't got money till I get my check.

43:41.060 --> 43:44.086
- Yeah?
- What is this?

43:44.262 --> 43:45.890
Take it easy. What's the problem?

43:46.699 --> 43:50.863
The tri-cone optimizers that feed
into the nipple-sleeve receivers...

43:51.137 --> 43:55.867
...perforated their lubricating bladders
and began punching against the side walls.

43:56.205 --> 44:00.302
Picture a knee, but without
any cartilage. Bone on bone.

44:00.476 --> 44:04.243
There's a shearing effect when
alloys of different density abrade.

44:04.415 --> 44:07.611
- The softer of the two--
- Magnetizes, reversing polarization. I know.

44:07.785 --> 44:09.412
Where's that put us?

44:11.554 --> 44:13.385
Cattled.

44:16.159 --> 44:19.754
Good news is, there's another B-600,
the one that dug the Chunnel.

44:19.928 --> 44:22.056
I thought we had the one that dug the Chunnel.

44:22.230 --> 44:24.222
- We did.
- This one dug from the French side.

44:24.400 --> 44:27.767
Bad news is, we're gonna have to
buy this one, and it's expensive.

44:27.936 --> 44:29.199
How much do we have left?

44:29.372 --> 44:31.862
If I tap the whole contingency,
just over ten million.

44:32.039 --> 44:33.508
- How close does that get us?
- No.

44:33.740 --> 44:35.107
- How much is it?
- Thirty...

44:35.276 --> 44:37.177
- Thirty?
- ...six.

44:37.412 --> 44:39.073
Thirty-six?

44:39.714 --> 44:43.739
- There's no way to do it without the drill?
- The drill's the exit strategy.

44:43.918 --> 44:47.445
Well, is there a way for us to raise money?

44:47.620 --> 44:49.588
I've got everything I have in this already.

44:49.855 --> 44:51.118
- So do I.
- Me too.

44:51.290 --> 44:52.588
We all do.

44:57.696 --> 45:01.860
If any one of us was lying up in that bed,
Reuben wouldn't rest until he made it right.

45:02.100 --> 45:06.037
I gotta go up there and tell him we failed,
and there's nothing we can do about it?

45:10.209 --> 45:12.540
- So we're stopping?
- I'm not saying that.

45:12.777 --> 45:14.506
So, what, then?

45:19.785 --> 45:24.278
Mr. Reuben is talking. He ask for Mr. Danny.

45:29.960 --> 45:33.292
- Rusty.
- I don't wanna go. No.

45:38.133 --> 45:40.567
I hear cars pulling in.

45:40.736 --> 45:45.469
I hear whispering conversations. Linus crying.

45:45.975 --> 45:49.342
Why don't you tell me
what everyone else seems to know?

45:51.980 --> 45:54.745
- Well, we came in here to--
- The thing is--

45:54.917 --> 45:56.645
Wait, wait.

45:57.653 --> 46:00.314
Hi, Reuben. Good to see you smiling again.

46:01.757 --> 46:03.484
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

46:03.657 --> 46:05.148
That's your idea?

46:05.994 --> 46:10.987
We've shaken all the trees, we've looked
under every rock, we've searched every....

46:11.765 --> 46:14.234
We've talked to everybody we can trust.

46:14.402 --> 46:16.302
It's not a great idea, but it is an idea.

46:16.470 --> 46:19.438
I think as long as we have
one idea, we shouldn't give up.

46:23.008 --> 46:25.499
I was really hoping
to avoid that this time.

46:32.018 --> 46:33.644
Number one:

46:34.352 --> 46:37.789
If any of you try to screw me, you'll be dead.

46:38.189 --> 46:40.680
I'm gonna be looking in
on the operation to make sure.

46:40.858 --> 46:44.420
Number two: If I lend you this
money, I'm your senior partner.

46:44.595 --> 46:49.033
Last money in, first money out.
And you will double my investment.

46:49.867 --> 46:51.459
Double.

46:54.872 --> 46:57.806
- Was that a yes?
- Double.

47:03.880 --> 47:08.316
That monstrosity that Bank calls a
hotel casts a shadow over my pool.

47:09.718 --> 47:10.980
Break him.

47:12.054 --> 47:14.648
Break him in half. The man has no taste.

47:14.824 --> 47:20.318
Yet, every time he opens a hotel, he wins
a Royal Review Board Five Diamond Award.

47:21.329 --> 47:24.128
Every time he wins a Five
Diamond Award, he celebrates by--

47:24.299 --> 47:26.391
We know. By buying one for his wife.

47:26.568 --> 47:28.967
- You mean five.
- One is five.

47:29.904 --> 47:31.599
Number three:

47:33.574 --> 47:35.404
I want you to steal the diamonds.

47:36.910 --> 47:38.902
- Can't be done.
- We don't have the manpower.

47:39.079 --> 47:40.307
- Or the time.
- Or a way in.

47:40.480 --> 47:43.678
If we get caught, we go away for
life. We won't risk that for you.

47:43.917 --> 47:47.614
They're not for me. I just want him
to lose what matters most to him.

47:47.787 --> 47:49.721
Do what you want with them.

47:49.924 --> 47:52.414
But either you steal the diamonds...

47:52.926 --> 47:55.688
...or you find somebody
else to finance your drill.

48:03.533 --> 48:05.229
What's the deal with these diamonds then?

48:05.403 --> 48:08.861
They're Tiffany, they're thirty carats
each, matching the awards plaques.

48:09.107 --> 48:12.439
On today's legitimate market,
they'd be worth $250 million.

48:12.709 --> 48:16.201
Bank's already purchased the next one
in anticipation of winning the award.

48:16.447 --> 48:20.382
The rest are kept in a secure glass
viewing booth at the top of the tower.

48:20.550 --> 48:23.041
- Benedict said we can keep them?
- That's what he said.

48:23.219 --> 48:25.985
Then why weren't these diamonds
on the agenda to begin with?

48:26.156 --> 48:27.953
Because it can't be done.

48:28.458 --> 48:30.788
This is why revenge jobs don't work, Daniel.

48:31.060 --> 48:34.723
You put yourself in a position, you
know you should walk away, but you can't.

48:34.963 --> 48:38.558
- This is how guys die or go to jail.
- All right.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.496
Anybody wanna walk away?

48:43.238 --> 48:46.138
- Saul?
- I didn't say I was walking away.

48:46.307 --> 48:48.002
Let's gut the son of a bitch.

48:49.643 --> 48:52.908
Okay. Now, Bank fired Gehry,
Gwathmey, Meier, four others...

48:53.080 --> 48:55.571
...just so he could say
he designed the hotel himself.

48:55.749 --> 48:58.718
What this means to us:
there's no set of unified plans.

48:59.185 --> 49:00.415
Routes?

49:00.587 --> 49:05.024
According to March '05 plans, there's
interior shafts with potential access...

49:05.193 --> 49:07.922
...to the diamond viewing
room here, here and here.

49:08.429 --> 49:10.988
But the May '05 plans only
show shafts here and here.

49:11.164 --> 49:13.358
September '05 shows no shafts.

49:13.533 --> 49:15.330
December '06 are the same as March '05.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.629
- How many sets of plans are there?
- That's ten.

49:19.906 --> 49:22.396
Since we can't trust
the accuracy of these drawings...

49:22.575 --> 49:26.533
...based on my walking around, these are
the shafts we have to clap an eyeball on.

49:26.778 --> 49:29.440
Now, there's no way of knowing
the thickness of the floor.

49:29.715 --> 49:32.740
Anything thicker than five
inches, we got a problem.

49:34.285 --> 49:36.445
This here is the elevator shaft...

49:36.720 --> 49:40.622
...which can be accessed through
a super-high-roller villa. Got it?

49:41.525 --> 49:44.550
All right. So who's gonna be
our super-high roller?

50:07.116 --> 50:09.448
I'm so sorry to have
been a little tardy, Mr...?

50:09.618 --> 50:12.916
Pepperidge, Lenny Pepperidge.
I'm Mr. Weng's communicator.

50:13.155 --> 50:16.249
He'd like you to know that he
was waiting for seven minutes.

50:16.759 --> 50:21.160
We received your $10 million cash deposit,
and I would like you to know that we--

50:21.428 --> 50:25.421
Mr. Weng won't take a line.
He's a man of extraordinary discipline.

50:25.665 --> 50:27.997
He's willing to risk ten
million, not a dollar more.

50:28.267 --> 50:31.566
- Did you say Mr. Weng was in real estate?
- That's right.

50:31.738 --> 50:35.173
I only ask because his name doesn't
come up on our standard file database.

50:35.442 --> 50:38.605
And Mr. Weng and I have worked
very hard to keep it that way.

50:38.844 --> 50:42.780
Exactly what kind of real estate
did you say that Mr. Weng was involved in?

50:42.947 --> 50:48.215
- Look, he owns all the air south of Beijing.
- The air?

50:48.386 --> 50:49.616
Put it to you this way:

50:49.789 --> 50:53.281
Try building something larger than
three stories in the Tianjin province...

50:53.459 --> 50:55.949
...see if his name comes up
in your database then.

50:58.028 --> 51:01.295
How quickly can you transfer his
money to the cage at the Bellagio?

51:01.466 --> 51:03.957
I don't think that's
necessary at all, Mr. Pepperidge.

51:04.135 --> 51:07.662
We have reserved our largest villa for Mr. Weng.

51:20.049 --> 51:21.710
Carson City, NV

51:21.984 --> 51:24.145
Extension 765.

51:24.387 --> 51:26.412
Hello, Robert. This is Abigail Sponder.

51:26.588 --> 51:31.117
Your bureau chief introduced us not too
long ago at the Gaming Fraud Seminar.

51:32.160 --> 51:34.924
I remember you. What can
I do for you, Ms. Sponder?

51:35.096 --> 51:36.926
We're about to open the new property...

51:37.097 --> 51:40.226
...and there are a couple of
characters here I'm not too sure about.

51:40.568 --> 51:43.003
Give me their names, and I'll check them out.

51:55.749 --> 51:57.578
Up you go.

51:59.519 --> 52:01.008
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.218
Too fast?

52:03.389 --> 52:05.880
You did the bullet-train
stunt with all Asia watching.

52:06.059 --> 52:07.822
The elevators aren't faster than that.

52:09.528 --> 52:12.826
- That was CGI?
- Wait, so those weren't your legs?

52:13.765 --> 52:15.425
- Wow.
- Jesus.

52:16.200 --> 52:19.260
Okay, then. We're down again.

52:20.204 --> 52:22.469
Well, what about Reuben?

52:23.774 --> 52:26.107
- There's hospice.
- Assisted living.

52:26.378 --> 52:28.709
We could pay somebody to read to him.

52:28.947 --> 52:30.776
Maybe he'll see his next birthday.

52:31.280 --> 52:35.445
- January? I don't think so.
- Shit.

52:37.889 --> 52:40.448
Shit, shit, shit.

53:24.498 --> 53:25.828
Shit.

53:31.605 --> 53:33.367
And then what happened?

53:33.539 --> 53:36.235
- She said she liked surprises.
- That's not what she meant.

53:36.409 --> 53:37.670
You think?

53:38.009 --> 53:39.671
So she put down the remote.

53:39.844 --> 53:43.440
- And I put the towel back on.
- Well, those are the waters.

53:44.848 --> 53:46.839
- Relationships can be--
- Sure.

53:47.185 --> 53:49.618
- But they're also--
- That's right.

53:52.057 --> 53:55.618
I've gone through so many blueprints,
I can taste the ink through my fingers.

53:56.292 --> 53:59.091
The only other access is
through the air conditioning duct.

53:59.264 --> 54:01.926
- We gotta move that guard.
- We don't have anything on him.

54:02.099 --> 54:05.295
- Then let's find something.
- I can get to the helipad from there too.

54:05.536 --> 54:07.367
Let's find something.

54:10.707 --> 54:13.039
I remember when this used to be the Dunes.

54:15.045 --> 54:18.572
Reuben taught me to shoot
craps here when I was a kid.

54:19.049 --> 54:24.143
I'd play hard ways and double
sixes. He straightened me out.

54:24.719 --> 54:29.281
I was twenty-two.

54:31.058 --> 54:32.719
First time I met Reuben...

54:32.995 --> 54:37.489
...he looked me off getting cheated
at an all-dealers game at the El Rancho.

54:37.665 --> 54:39.825
Then he bought me breakfast.

54:43.068 --> 54:47.130
The Sands was there, Desert Inn.

54:48.408 --> 54:53.176
- They built them a lot smaller back then.
- They seemed pretty big.

54:54.848 --> 54:56.874
Town's changed.

56:06.313 --> 56:11.775
If I read one more puff piece
about Vegas legend Terry Benedict...

56:11.950 --> 56:14.249
...I'm gonna have to buy a magazine of my own.

56:14.420 --> 56:16.478
And I haven't forgotten about that phone.

56:16.823 --> 56:19.088
The gold model? The one that
retails for ten thousand?

56:19.326 --> 56:21.418
That's the one. That top-of-the-line Samsung.

56:21.660 --> 56:24.721
Okay, that would be ungettable.

56:24.897 --> 56:27.093
No, no. You call Teddy Sanders in Promotions.

56:27.267 --> 56:28.494
I did that.

56:28.667 --> 56:33.263
He promised you the very first one, as soon
as it comes off the line in September.

56:33.506 --> 56:38.169
Well, that's July for me.
You just make it happen.

56:42.180 --> 56:43.510
What'd he say about Samsung?

56:43.782 --> 56:46.683
He said he used to bowl
with the owner of Samsung.

56:48.352 --> 56:50.013
Well, call Danny.

56:50.353 --> 56:55.255
Oh, and tell Danny I know the perfect
guy we can use for the roper at the Expo.

57:04.700 --> 57:07.192
I thought we were addressing this.

57:07.469 --> 57:11.166
- We were. We are. Randall is.
- I must've put too much--

57:11.339 --> 57:15.207
Don't blame yourself.
He should've fired you a week ago.

57:16.210 --> 57:17.768
Bye.

57:21.883 --> 57:23.908
Are you having a nice day?

57:27.387 --> 57:30.879
And you, sir? How's your Bank experience?

57:31.057 --> 57:34.720
- Well, it's--
- Can I be of any personal assistance to you?

57:36.562 --> 57:39.053
This is quite unorthodox.

57:39.565 --> 57:43.661
I have never found myself
talking directly to a hotel owner.

57:44.402 --> 57:46.893
I understand. You're just a customer.

57:47.238 --> 57:49.866
And I'm just an engaged innkeeper.

57:50.040 --> 57:52.510
- Spot on.
- Spot on.

57:52.910 --> 57:56.541
Well, so far, in my book...

57:56.915 --> 57:59.748
...this establishment is aces.

58:00.585 --> 58:04.576
Aces? That's good. The ace of diamonds...

58:04.922 --> 58:06.253
...I hope.

58:06.924 --> 58:10.360
I see what you're-- Diamonds, indeed. Yes!

58:21.870 --> 58:23.099
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:23.272 --> 58:28.038
The guard by the main elevator shaft has a
little Hitler for a son. A real Ritalin sniffer.

58:28.210 --> 58:31.442
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, I just bit into a pepper, and....

58:32.179 --> 58:33.442
Anyway....

58:34.282 --> 58:36.273
Is that...?

58:36.450 --> 58:37.918
Are you...?

58:39.787 --> 58:42.051
Are you watching Oprah?

58:43.122 --> 58:45.455
With a bottle of wine?

58:45.960 --> 58:48.292
- Did you TiVo this?
- I was reading the paper.

58:48.560 --> 58:50.029
With the sound at full volume?

58:50.599 --> 58:53.192
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hold on, hold on.

58:53.367 --> 58:58.303
And not one, not two,
not three, but twelve new beds.

59:10.315 --> 59:13.978
It's not just about the kids.
I mean, I'm happy for the kids.

59:14.319 --> 59:16.843
I think we've come up
with the answer to your prayers.

59:17.020 --> 59:19.989
This is what I think we're gonna do.
We are buying you a house!

59:20.258 --> 59:21.885
How's it going in Mexico?

59:23.995 --> 59:25.894
Well, Turk's there.

59:26.664 --> 59:28.655
Are they really gonna build her a new home?

59:28.833 --> 59:30.800
Yeah, for the whole family.

59:46.850 --> 59:48.112
Then what did you say?

59:48.285 --> 59:49.945
- What could I say?
- Nothing.

59:50.185 --> 59:52.086
That's what I said.

59:52.255 --> 59:53.720
Hey.

59:54.956 --> 59:58.358
- You guys been talking to my father?
- Why would we do that?

59:58.693 --> 01:00:00.684
That's not a no.

01:00:02.497 --> 01:00:04.828
He just wanted to know
how the nose was working.

01:00:04.998 --> 01:00:07.968
Oh, I knew it, man.
He just can't leave it alone.

01:00:09.036 --> 01:00:11.631
- What'd you say?
- Oh, I told him the nose plays.

01:00:11.873 --> 01:00:13.304
- The nose does play.
- It plays.

01:00:13.472 --> 01:00:15.133
- It's great.
- It's huge.

01:00:15.375 --> 01:00:19.106
Turk? Hey, are you gonna get the factory open?

01:00:19.279 --> 01:00:21.974
Hell, yes! We just gotta break management!

01:00:22.215 --> 01:00:24.705
They can't keep treating us like this!

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:27.043
Well, I gotta go!

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:04.020
- Ortega here. Oh, no.
- Mr. Ortega, this is Vice Principal Meckler.

01:01:04.187 --> 01:01:07.952
I'm afraid so. We've had another
incident with Manny and Ms. Kelso.

01:01:08.124 --> 01:01:09.455
It was the leg this time.

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.717
We need somebody to come down and pick him up.

01:01:11.893 --> 01:01:14.794
- My wife can't--?
- We haven't been able to get a hold of her.

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:16.659
We've left messages.

01:01:17.934 --> 01:01:21.664
Yo, yo, yo! Buddy, buddy! Do me a favor.
Cover my post for half an hour.

01:01:21.838 --> 01:01:23.304
I was just about to go on break.

01:01:23.473 --> 01:01:26.406
Come on, man. Help me out.
My kid just bit the lunch lady again.

01:01:26.907 --> 01:01:29.172
- Yeah, all right.
- All right, man, I owe you one.

01:01:29.344 --> 01:01:30.902
Yeah, you do.

01:02:08.647 --> 01:02:10.046
All right.

01:02:10.214 --> 01:02:12.149
According to this...

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:15.484
...the room where
the diamonds are held...

01:02:15.988 --> 01:02:18.319
...is directly above here.

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:36.930
A quarter billion dollars' worth of diamonds...

01:02:37.106 --> 01:02:39.541
...and eighteen inches of
poured concrete in the way.

01:02:40.275 --> 01:02:41.971
Man, we can't drill through that.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.171
It's just one thing too many.

01:02:47.449 --> 01:02:49.644
We're talking about a secure room, Terry.

01:02:49.818 --> 01:02:52.218
This isn't a glass box
these diamonds are housed in.

01:02:52.387 --> 01:02:54.618
This is two-inch-thick,
concussion-proof glass.

01:02:54.856 --> 01:02:58.019
Wired with pressure-sensitive
seven-digit coded alarms.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:01.086
Kill the power to the hotel.
It's worked for you before.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.459
No, see, the case and the alarm
both have independent power supply.

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:08.796
And besides, you don't run the same
gag twice. You do the next gag.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:14.170
How big a deal is it
if we don't get the diamonds?

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:17.505
You have all your affairs in order?

01:03:19.277 --> 01:03:21.712
All right. So, what we have to do is...

01:03:22.148 --> 01:03:25.948
...get inside that glass case
and switch in the replicas.

01:03:26.118 --> 01:03:29.645
How are we supposed to get in the room?
Bank is the only one with access.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.016
- Sponder has too.
- Sponder has access?

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:33.986
Then we're in.

01:03:34.725 --> 01:03:36.784
Sponder's a....

01:03:37.395 --> 01:03:40.056
Well, I believe the term is "cougar".

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.063
It's not my term.
I read about it in Maxim magazine.

01:03:48.906 --> 01:03:50.669
Okay. Let's get Rusty in position--

01:03:50.908 --> 01:03:53.070
No, not Rusty. Me. I'm already in there.

01:03:53.244 --> 01:03:56.679
I put this whole thing in motion
before I even realized it.

01:03:56.913 --> 01:04:00.714
I'm so deep into Pepperidge,
I don't even think. I just react. I am him.

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.376
You know what? Okay, great. Great.

01:04:04.553 --> 01:04:06.521
Would you just tell them?

01:04:08.156 --> 01:04:09.885
Oh, now you don't understand English?

01:04:13.493 --> 01:04:16.555
She was not trying not
to laugh. You know what?

01:04:17.198 --> 01:04:20.100
- I can do it.
- He says he can do it.

01:04:20.935 --> 01:04:24.597
All right, Linus, go get her.
Give him the accelerator.

01:04:24.772 --> 01:04:27.708
- Natural? Chemical?
- I don't need an accelerator.

01:04:27.876 --> 01:04:29.342
- Make it powerful.
- Thanks a lot.

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:31.102
- I'll fly in a Gilroy.
- Get two.

01:04:31.444 --> 01:04:34.880
- You don't need it.
- Just one Gilroy. Last time you did two--

01:04:35.048 --> 01:04:38.450
News from Mexico.
From a journalista I used to....

01:04:38.718 --> 01:04:42.210
She's an ally of the workers.
What she tells me...

01:04:42.455 --> 01:04:44.889
...is that the strike hinges
on working conditions...

01:04:45.058 --> 01:04:48.550
...and the fact that labor feels
they're underpaid by fifty percent.

01:04:49.128 --> 01:04:52.722
I'm sure you'll agree, Terry,
it's always about the money.

01:04:52.964 --> 01:04:54.455
How much are we talking about?

01:04:54.632 --> 01:04:56.463
- Thirty-six thousand.
- How many workers?

01:04:56.634 --> 01:04:59.297
- Two hundred, give or take.
- All right, that's....

01:04:59.469 --> 01:05:00.960
Just over seven million dollars.

01:05:01.239 --> 01:05:05.801
No, no. Not 36k per person. 36 total.

01:05:06.978 --> 01:05:10.470
Turk and Virgil got them
holding out for $3.50 a week?

01:05:10.815 --> 01:05:13.977
- It is a five percent increase.
- We'll write them a check.

01:05:16.753 --> 01:05:18.050
We'll post-date it.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.687
Remember, tell my brother "hang tough".

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.433
This is Roman Nagel.

01:06:40.843 --> 01:06:44.506
If your consciousness
absolutely has to intrude upon mine...

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.672
...leave me a message.

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:49.282
Hey, Roman? It's Livingston.

01:06:49.853 --> 01:06:54.654
I heard you were out here, taking
some meetings, and I was wondering...

01:06:54.825 --> 01:06:56.794
...if you could help me out...

01:06:57.028 --> 01:07:01.522
...with a technical problem I've been
having with one of my assignments.

01:07:01.933 --> 01:07:06.199
And I was hoping that we could,
you know, keep it on the down low...

01:07:06.537 --> 01:07:10.668
...from Danny and the other guys,
that I'm coming to you for help.

01:07:11.877 --> 01:07:14.710
So call me when you get this. Okay?

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:16.605
Okay.

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:18.044
Bye.

01:07:26.325 --> 01:07:27.884
Was Sponder with him?

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.552
- "A whole new segment."
- Which car?

01:07:32.899 --> 01:07:35.890
- Which Rolls?
- "Exclusive rights."

01:07:36.168 --> 01:07:38.034
What's the ETA?

01:07:38.404 --> 01:07:40.805
- "In Tunica, Mississippi."
- Okay.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.236
He's on his way.

01:07:42.843 --> 01:07:46.245
- Think he's gonna fall for this?
- You did.

01:07:46.514 --> 01:07:48.141
You ready?

01:07:48.917 --> 01:07:50.749
I was born ready.

01:08:06.937 --> 01:08:08.370
Who advanced this?

01:08:08.539 --> 01:08:10.804
Did I not say he was to
have this room to himself?

01:08:10.975 --> 01:08:13.602
And what part of that
did you not understand?

01:08:13.777 --> 01:08:16.269
How are you? I caught
your show. That kid is great.

01:08:16.447 --> 01:08:19.609
Thank you for that. Congratulations
on the enormity of your success.

01:08:19.885 --> 01:08:22.252
- Back at you.
- Love and respect. Peace.

01:08:22.421 --> 01:08:24.912
Good seeing you, Bernie.

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:28.288
Allow me to introduce to you
the greatest advance in gaming...

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.294
...since pari-mutuel wagering.
Get beyond boring cards and tired dice.

01:08:33.466 --> 01:08:38.301
It's electrifying!
It's exciting! It's 'Nuff Said!

01:08:38.471 --> 01:08:39.962
Yes, sir.

01:08:40.809 --> 01:08:44.642
Oh, my God. Mr. Bank. It's an honor, sir.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:48.439
May I please give you a
demonstration of casino dominoes?

01:08:48.617 --> 01:08:50.313
House edge fourteen percent.

01:08:50.653 --> 01:08:52.746
- Is this documented?
- Of course.

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:56.153
The action makes the player feel
like they have a fighting chance...

01:08:56.326 --> 01:08:59.453
...if you understand my meaning.
Check it out, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:02.428
Mr. Bank is gonna give a young
and upcoming gamer a chance.

01:09:02.599 --> 01:09:06.162
Give him a warm applause. Come on now!

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:10.073
- All right. Make it quick.
- Thank you, sir.

01:09:10.242 --> 01:09:14.678
Mr. Bank. First round of
betting. Next, dominoes!

01:09:15.013 --> 01:09:18.505
Second round of betting.
Upcoming, community dominoes.

01:09:18.783 --> 01:09:22.778
Mr. Bank, if a player wins on a
multiple of five on the first spin...

01:09:23.023 --> 01:09:25.014
...he or she is a winner.

01:09:25.358 --> 01:09:28.488
Payout, 5-to-1. But guess what.

01:09:29.363 --> 01:09:31.626
They're already laying 11-to-1.

01:09:31.865 --> 01:09:35.234
So when they win, Mr. Bank, we win.

01:09:35.703 --> 01:09:37.432
'Nuff Said.

01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:39.968
That is good.

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:43.202
I tell you what. Why don't you
send me some of your literature...

01:09:43.377 --> 01:09:45.470
...and we'll see what we can do.

01:09:45.647 --> 01:09:47.979
Literature, literature. Mr. Bank, come on.

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:52.018
You don't need to read no literature.
All you need to do is feel it!

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:56.888
Well, I feel it. It's just that I
don't know if it's bankable. All right?

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.186
Bankable?

01:09:58.363 --> 01:10:01.058
I'd like to place this
game in one of my casinos.

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:04.665
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
That's progressive thinking.

01:10:06.072 --> 01:10:10.236
I embrace the fact that 'Nuff Said might
grow a whole new segment in my hotels.

01:10:10.409 --> 01:10:11.808
Hello!

01:10:11.978 --> 01:10:15.708
And I'd like to lock this up
right now. Exclusive rights.

01:10:16.883 --> 01:10:20.046
I wanna place this beautiful
domino table at our Tunica location.

01:10:20.854 --> 01:10:23.722
Mississippi? That's where
games go to die, isn't it?

01:10:23.892 --> 01:10:25.860
Stay out of this, Bank. You already passed.

01:10:26.027 --> 01:10:29.020
Really? Then do for him what I'm prepared to.

01:10:29.765 --> 01:10:34.361
Prime placement, center room, Vegas, tonight.

01:10:55.059 --> 01:10:58.188
Mr. Bank has three minutes, you've got one. Go!

01:10:58.363 --> 01:11:00.194
Well, there'll be a series of brocades.

01:11:00.365 --> 01:11:03.129
Then the dahlia shells,
weeping willows, tiger tails--

01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:06.863
- Whoa, whoa. When's the jump?
- The motorcycle guy?

01:11:07.039 --> 01:11:10.807
Mr. Roads will jump his motorcycle
through the fireworks and over the Bank--

01:11:11.078 --> 01:11:14.240
You guys gotta get together
on this. Fireworks and stunts.

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:16.141
You gotta be on the same page.

01:11:16.416 --> 01:11:20.080
All eyes of Vegas are gonna be
on me. It's gotta be perfect.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.152
All right. So take it from the top.

01:11:22.425 --> 01:11:26.156
- Yes, sir. Around about 12:00--
- No, not around about. At twelve.

01:11:26.496 --> 01:11:29.829
The stroke of midnight.
Go off the Navy master clock.

01:11:30.167 --> 01:11:32.999
Oh, don't make a maniac out of me.

01:11:41.846 --> 01:11:45.179
- Where the hell are they going?
- I don't really know what's happening.

01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:49.615
We've just lost two dozen of our
biggest players without an explanation.

01:11:50.022 --> 01:11:52.115
Well, get an explanation!

01:11:58.466 --> 01:12:02.026
Ms. Sponder, this just came in.
Rush express. Hand-delivered.

01:12:05.173 --> 01:12:09.336
Oh, thank you. Thank you! Thanks.

01:12:09.878 --> 01:12:11.743
My pleasure.

01:12:35.907 --> 01:12:37.567
Guys. Let's go.

01:12:42.915 --> 01:12:45.075
Mr. Bank

01:12:45.984 --> 01:12:50.422
My dear Mr. B., this is a thank you
for all that you've given me.

01:12:50.757 --> 01:12:55.091
The opportunity, the kindness,
the warmth, the ch--

01:12:56.763 --> 01:12:59.028
The one you couldn't get, huh?

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:02.859
The one you couldn't get.

01:14:51.393 --> 01:14:55.591
- How did Ocean get all my big players?
- Would you like me to have him removed?

01:14:57.165 --> 01:14:59.031
They'll all go with him.

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:04.805
- Hey.
- How are the matches?

01:15:04.974 --> 01:15:07.000
Why don't you come see for yourself?

01:15:41.449 --> 01:15:42.780
All right.

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:46.613
Why don't you give me one reason
not to bounce your ass out of my place?

01:15:46.787 --> 01:15:50.484
You know the reasons. You already
decided before you walked over here.

01:15:50.792 --> 01:15:53.454
They were all booked here. You took them.

01:15:53.795 --> 01:15:57.459
What did you do, bribe them? Buy them? Trick them?

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.392
Yes.

01:15:59.637 --> 01:16:02.128
You brought them here to rub it in my face.

01:16:03.473 --> 01:16:07.468
You know, you're half-smart, Ocean.

01:16:08.812 --> 01:16:12.806
Why don't you get real smart? Let them play here...

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:15.979
...and I'll give you ten percent of their losses.

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:21.984
- You give it to Reuben if it'll make you--
- I'm not that easy. You almost killed him.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:25.988
Twenty percent whenever they gamble here.

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.127
Twenty?

01:16:29.437 --> 01:16:31.301
So it's done?

01:16:32.106 --> 01:16:35.666
- How do I know you won't--?
- We cash out every night, settle in cash.

01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:38.637
Otherwise, take them back again.

01:16:40.848 --> 01:16:44.512
- They'll need villas.
- Villas?

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.750
Okay.

01:16:51.193 --> 01:16:52.957
Let's go, boys.

01:16:53.196 --> 01:16:57.189
There we go. All right. Let's hit the tables.

01:16:57.367 --> 01:17:01.327
But I say, why not feel it? Why not feel the rush?

01:17:01.505 --> 01:17:03.165
Come on. Take a trip.

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.309
Shake my hand. Who knows?

01:17:06.044 --> 01:17:09.638
Maybe you have what it takes to break The Bank.

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:20.484
- Long past checkout time, sir.
- What? I'm in no condition to check out.

01:17:20.727 --> 01:17:23.287
You've overstayed your
reservation. We need the room.

01:17:23.463 --> 01:17:25.728
Innkeeper laws make it illegal to evict a guest--

01:17:25.999 --> 01:17:28.092
Except in cases of public health and safety...

01:17:28.268 --> 01:17:33.206
...when the occupant evidences a flagrant
and repeated disregard for personal hygiene.

01:17:33.375 --> 01:17:34.898
I haven't disregarded my hygiene.

01:17:35.075 --> 01:17:37.203
- You have.
- Sir, what we're trying to say is...

01:17:37.379 --> 01:17:39.141
- ...you've gone nose deaf.
- What?

01:17:39.313 --> 01:17:41.509
You're oblivious to your effect on other guests.

01:17:41.683 --> 01:17:44.848
- I really don't see what effect--
- Fifteen minutes!

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.750
Fifteen minutes. Hey, fifteen minutes.

01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:51.549
Pack your things or we will
pack them for you. Get the picture?

01:17:51.728 --> 01:17:52.990
- What?
- Get the picture?

01:17:53.163 --> 01:17:55.188
- Pack your things.
- Don't make us come back.

01:17:55.365 --> 01:17:57.890
- Pack your things!
- Hey, okay.

01:17:58.069 --> 01:17:59.502
Okay.

01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:29.971
- Well, hello there.
- There are no tomorrows, Mr. Pepperidge.

01:18:53.998 --> 01:18:55.898
Call me Lenny.

01:19:01.507 --> 01:19:03.633
I need this room.

01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:08.743
I gave Mr. Chang a....

01:19:10.516 --> 01:19:13.612
Mr. Weng a chance.

01:19:17.690 --> 01:19:21.093
I need the Asian villas, all the Asian villas.

01:19:21.262 --> 01:19:24.459
Well, perhaps you'd like to tell...

01:19:24.633 --> 01:19:29.037
...Mr. Weng yourself.

01:19:33.542 --> 01:19:36.706
In fact, I would. I would. Because...

01:19:37.046 --> 01:19:42.040
...you know, the last time we
spoke, he was quite rude to me.

01:19:42.385 --> 01:19:45.878
Well, in that case,
you'll find him somewhere...

01:19:46.223 --> 01:19:50.058
...between the cashier's cage
and the high-stakes Pai Gow room.

01:19:51.396 --> 01:19:56.333
He was about to eat, when the
mood to play suddenly hit him.

01:19:57.236 --> 01:20:00.171
It just hit him, just like that?

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.731
I might've said something to encourage him.

01:20:06.079 --> 01:20:08.344
Why would you do that?

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:11.646
When you work for a powerful man...

01:20:12.252 --> 01:20:16.689
...sometimes the collar can get a little tight.

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:23.625
Excuse me.

01:20:34.778 --> 01:20:36.439
- Is it on?
- Yeah.

01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:41.440
- Thanks, homes.
- You're welcome.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.848
Nestor says hang tough.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:58.928
Mr. Bank, I just wanna thank you
for throwing me out of your hotel.

01:21:00.674 --> 01:21:03.905
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.512
All right, fellas.

01:21:17.092 --> 01:21:19.788
You're such an idiot.

01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:22.058
Careful.

01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:26.099
He used to gamble too.
I'm not kidding you. Right here.

01:21:43.288 --> 01:21:46.781
We're gonna need you standing
by in a support capacity.

01:21:50.965 --> 01:21:53.126
Bad news just walked in.

01:21:53.467 --> 01:21:55.197
All right, the Bureau's in the house.

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:57.998
If they move towards blackjack,
somebody tip Livingston.

01:21:58.173 --> 01:22:02.076
Let me welcome you to The Bank
with our finest Kubota sake.

01:22:02.645 --> 01:22:06.911
And good to have you back, Denny.
Got some Grey Goose on ice for you.

01:22:07.316 --> 01:22:09.182
Enjoy.

01:22:24.335 --> 01:22:27.999
Livingston Dell? Federal Bureau of Investigation.

01:22:28.274 --> 01:22:32.371
We've got all the exits covered.
You got nowhere to go. Don't be stupid.

01:22:39.152 --> 01:22:42.120
Hey, what is going on here?

01:22:42.354 --> 01:22:43.754
You've been breached.

01:22:43.924 --> 01:22:47.122
We've had this man under
surveillance. He rigs machines.

01:22:47.695 --> 01:22:49.093
He rigs them?

01:22:49.262 --> 01:22:52.892
We've been in contact with his company.
His background information was bogus.

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.329
How many machines has he gotten his hands on?

01:22:57.506 --> 01:22:58.939
I'm not sure.

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:02.310
- Well, let's change them out.
- We won't have enough.

01:23:02.545 --> 01:23:04.739
The company's sending over new machines.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:07.041
If he rigs machines, he's working with players.

01:23:07.317 --> 01:23:10.413
We know he has confederates.
We just don't know who they are.

01:23:10.589 --> 01:23:14.046
If you see anything that
looks unusual, you contact us.

01:23:14.325 --> 01:23:17.886
You bet. You think this is over? This isn't over.

01:23:18.228 --> 01:23:22.064
I'm pressing charges. State
and federal charges. Got it?

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.728
Now, get him off my floor. Come on.

01:23:29.675 --> 01:23:32.167
His fingerprints were all
over that shuffle machine.

01:23:32.412 --> 01:23:35.745
I need a name and all
known criminal associates.

01:23:36.716 --> 01:23:39.185
Bank's gonna run the prints
off the shuffle machine.

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.751
Damn, he's good.

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.148
He'll get Livingston's ID and known associates.

01:23:43.757 --> 01:23:45.089
That's us.

01:23:45.426 --> 01:23:47.394
What do we have in place for this?

01:23:47.762 --> 01:23:51.358
Nothing. They'll scoop us all up and
Bank'll have the best night of his life.

01:23:51.534 --> 01:23:52.558
It can't get to Bank.

01:23:55.938 --> 01:24:00.501
I know what to do. We'll set up a cartwheel.
Back of the house, fifteen minutes.

01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:02.704
Who's gonna hack this?

01:24:03.047 --> 01:24:05.708
The ideal person's in the
back of a car in handcuffs.

01:24:05.949 --> 01:24:08.783
- I can handle it.
- Is anyone else available?

01:24:09.054 --> 01:24:11.715
- This is Virgil. I'll give it a shot.
- I can handle it.

01:24:11.956 --> 01:24:14.391
- Virgil it is.
- Get it done, Virg.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.754
Switch these out first, then do the main floor.

01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:43.890
Absolutely.

01:24:46.429 --> 01:24:49.990
All right, time for the starter's gun.
Rusty, what's your twenty?

01:24:53.103 --> 01:24:55.162
Anybody got eyes on Rusty?

01:24:55.772 --> 01:24:59.435
My guys are getting roughed up, and
they're gonna walk. This is a two-man play.

01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:03.172
Back in range. Just had to
make a last-minute pickup.

01:25:04.282 --> 01:25:05.509
Hi, boys.

01:25:05.682 --> 01:25:07.014
- There he is.
- Hey, Reuben!

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:09.245
- Reuben, welcome back.
- We missed you, buddy.

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:10.912
Reuben, welcome back.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:18.019
Let's raise the minimum.
I'd like to play all the seats.

01:25:42.056 --> 01:25:45.391
- Really? Pineapple?
- Yeah.

01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:50.495
Wait, wait. No, no.
Not here. I could lose my job.

01:25:50.667 --> 01:25:53.568
Doesn't the forbidden make it
seem so much more pleasurable?

01:25:53.837 --> 01:25:58.832
No, no. No, Abby. I can't be free
with myself in Mr. Weng's villa.

01:25:59.244 --> 01:26:02.042
- Is there another room?
- No, we're overbooked by 40 percent.

01:26:02.213 --> 01:26:04.841
Somewhere. Somewhere we can
go where we can be alone.

01:26:05.584 --> 01:26:10.852
- Please, Abby, take me.
- Okay. Come with me.

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:18.924
Cue the slots.

01:26:32.449 --> 01:26:36.214
This is why we have soft openings,
so things like this don't happen.

01:26:36.385 --> 01:26:38.546
- Get them fixed.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:01.847 --> 01:27:03.145
Stunning.

01:27:03.416 --> 01:27:06.908
- What is, me or the diamonds?
- Both.

01:27:07.153 --> 01:27:11.251
You know, Lenny, I think you're
the most honest man in this town.

01:27:13.092 --> 01:27:18.190
And I don't think we're gonna need
the security cameras for this next part.

01:27:18.365 --> 01:27:22.131
Well, not unless you wanna watch the playback.

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:28.341
I thought we agreed to turn off our phones.

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.840
I know, but that's Bank.

01:27:30.013 --> 01:27:32.174
He's the only one that has that number and--

01:27:38.688 --> 01:27:41.522
I could make you give that back to me now.

01:27:41.692 --> 01:27:43.124
You could try.

01:27:45.329 --> 01:27:50.631
- Do you have any wine back there?
- I got everything you need back there.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.838
Château d'Yquem?

01:27:58.877 --> 01:28:01.574
As long as it's not '73.

01:28:19.668 --> 01:28:21.727
Search for Known Associates

01:28:29.079 --> 01:28:30.876
Send that to Bank's office.

01:28:55.207 --> 01:28:57.233
- Yeah.
- Cue the cartwheel.

01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:58.775
You got it.

01:28:58.945 --> 01:29:01.209
I was so happy when I saw her on the magazine.

01:29:01.448 --> 01:29:05.112
She's actually one person I really,
you know, want to do awesome.

01:29:05.386 --> 01:29:08.480
You know, want her to actually get somewhere.

01:29:09.223 --> 01:29:11.658
Hello. Oh, hey, Saul.

01:29:11.828 --> 01:29:14.455
--came out here originally for hotel management.

01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:16.061
For school.

01:29:16.633 --> 01:29:19.328
But, like...

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.496
...I don't know.

01:29:25.675 --> 01:29:30.909
- Mr. Roads told us to wait inside.
- We'll be interviewing him.

01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:36.487
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:30:04.018 --> 01:30:07.818
- I'm so sorry, sir. I tried to stop him.
- Not your fault, sweetheart.

01:30:07.989 --> 01:30:11.358
You can't stop a man who's jumped
thirty-six Greyhounds end-to-end.

01:30:11.528 --> 01:30:15.190
It's all right, Lucille.
I'll speak with him. Yes?

01:30:17.033 --> 01:30:20.661
Mr. Bank, do you know
what Chuck Berry said...

01:30:20.836 --> 01:30:23.397
...every night before counting,
"One, two, three, four"?

01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:28.406
- What did he say?
- "Pay me my money!"

01:30:28.579 --> 01:30:31.413
- I'm sure my people will be--
- "In cash."

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:33.346
Cash?

01:30:33.518 --> 01:30:35.543
You've already been wired the money!

01:30:35.887 --> 01:30:38.879
Mr. Bank, this is-- This is--

01:30:39.224 --> 01:30:41.693
This is a Fender Roads moment!

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.892
- You in yet?
- I hate that question.

01:30:55.242 --> 01:30:58.609
Mr. Bank, Mr. Bank, listen.
With all due respect, sir...

01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:01.214
...you got a job tomorrow, running this place.

01:31:01.383 --> 01:31:04.876
- You go to work every day.
- Oh, yawn. I make one phone call...

01:31:05.054 --> 01:31:09.821
...I get Shaun White, Travis Pastrana,
five of their buddies here before midnight...

01:31:09.992 --> 01:31:13.088
...doing heel-clickers and lazy-boys
off the back of the building.

01:31:13.429 --> 01:31:18.424
Yes, if your audience wants to see a bunch
of long-hairs riding rice rockets.

01:31:18.769 --> 01:31:23.536
But I'm talking about heavy bikes, sir.
This is heavy bike! Fender Roads is a....

01:31:24.275 --> 01:31:27.176
I'm a goddamn American icon!

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.950
Don't change it that much. Keep the structure.

01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:35.848
I'm trying to make you taller.
Don't you wanna be taller?

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:40.050
- You're a midget in thirty-four states.
- An animal in the other thirty-four.

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:43.291
Twenty-four. Twenty-two.

01:31:43.463 --> 01:31:47.458
This is a night people will talk about
as long as there's a Las Vegas.

01:31:47.803 --> 01:31:52.797
And when they're talking about it, they'll
either be talking about you or they won't.

01:31:53.643 --> 01:31:56.168
Now, that's your choice.

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:00.643
Mr. Bank, can I just say one more thing?

01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:09.824
- Are you gonna jump?
- Jumping, baby!

01:32:10.328 --> 01:32:13.889
Bank here. Yeah, I'm looking.

01:32:18.505 --> 01:32:20.266
All right, Rusty's up.

01:32:20.438 --> 01:32:22.838
I gotta say, I'm impressed.
You did a very nice job.

01:32:23.008 --> 01:32:25.841
I know I did. That's why they
asked me to do it and not you.

01:32:26.946 --> 01:32:30.349
Wow, see, that is me
offering you an olive basket...

01:32:30.518 --> 01:32:32.952
...and that is you spitting in my face.

01:32:33.187 --> 01:32:34.553
Was that your face?

01:32:35.357 --> 01:32:36.949
Okay, where's Eugene's trap door?

01:32:37.192 --> 01:32:39.455
Under the dragon,
first machine on the left.

01:32:39.627 --> 01:32:40.924
Got it. What's the sequence?

01:32:41.095 --> 01:32:42.961
Coin, three count. Coin, six count.

01:32:43.198 --> 01:32:45.928
Three coins, five count.
Two coins, half count.

01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:48.002
Could you make it any more complicated?

01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:50.799
That's just the first sequence.
Then there's two more.

01:32:50.974 --> 01:32:52.601
Right.

01:33:59.116 --> 01:34:00.378
I think...

01:34:00.785 --> 01:34:02.946
... I think I may have got all five.

01:34:03.288 --> 01:34:05.951
I did. I got all five.
I got all five. Oh, my God.

01:34:06.292 --> 01:34:08.521
Oh, my God. I'm the winner!

01:34:12.266 --> 01:34:14.289
Oh, my God!

01:34:27.314 --> 01:34:30.079
Progressive slots win on opening night?

01:34:35.325 --> 01:34:38.657
Genuine shock. Genuine
surprise. Pupil dilation.

01:34:38.995 --> 01:34:40.986
Elevated heartbeat.

01:34:41.664 --> 01:34:43.132
It's legitimate.

01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:56.478
- New dice coming in.
- New dice.

01:34:59.118 --> 01:35:00.813
New dice coming in.

01:35:19.674 --> 01:35:21.471
New ball coming in.

01:36:18.107 --> 01:36:21.735
- What was that?
- You felt it too?

01:36:26.448 --> 01:36:30.442
You place your own bet right
there. That's what you do there.

01:36:30.787 --> 01:36:32.619
Let me tell you something.

01:36:34.290 --> 01:36:36.783
You are a winner.

01:36:38.963 --> 01:36:40.624
Greco's still up.

01:36:41.632 --> 01:36:43.191
That's it for Plan A.

01:36:43.368 --> 01:36:45.631
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, place your bets.

01:36:45.803 --> 01:36:47.135
There can only be one winner!

01:36:56.316 --> 01:37:00.149
Everything all right? Are we okay?
Did that tremor throw off the system?

01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:02.252
No, sir. It would take more than that--

01:37:02.423 --> 01:37:04.186
- Sir?
- Yeah.

01:37:04.358 --> 01:37:07.988
I have a pit boss asking for an
approval. He can't reach Ms. Sponder.

01:37:08.329 --> 01:37:11.594
- What's the action?
- Ten million. Roulette.

01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:16.968
- It's good.
- Book it.

01:37:19.676 --> 01:37:22.542
All right, the gentleman's down
to a three-number combination.

01:37:22.710 --> 01:37:25.180
Eleven, twelve and thirteen.

01:37:31.355 --> 01:37:33.755
You get reception in here? That's impossible.

01:37:33.925 --> 01:37:35.553
Not with this phone.

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:39.387
Yeah, sorry. Hello? Bank here.

01:37:39.565 --> 01:37:41.624
We're getting interference on server one.

01:37:41.867 --> 01:37:44.359
- What kind?
- I don't know.

01:37:44.537 --> 01:37:46.663
- Hello?
- Server one is going down.

01:37:46.839 --> 01:37:48.238
- Oh, no.
- Server two--

01:37:48.407 --> 01:37:51.741
Something's in here. That's the
explanation, some kind of magnetron.

01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:53.538
Server three's starting to wobble.

01:37:53.713 --> 01:37:56.046
A magnetron? Who's got a magnetron?

01:37:56.517 --> 01:37:58.951
- Four is down!
- And five. They're all going.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.249
Everyone in this room!
Empty your pockets! Now!

01:38:02.424 --> 01:38:04.517
What's "all going"? What does that mean?

01:38:05.527 --> 01:38:07.860
Oh, no. What the hell is this?

01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:11.362
Security measures. When
the system senses a threat...

01:38:11.534 --> 01:38:13.092
...it shuts down and reboots.

01:38:17.707 --> 01:38:19.369
For how long?

01:38:19.543 --> 01:38:21.874
Three minutes and twenty seconds.

01:38:34.393 --> 01:38:35.883
Snake eyes. All of it.

01:38:43.503 --> 01:38:45.438
Oh, that son of a bitch.

01:38:52.346 --> 01:38:54.678
We can't take any more
bets until we're back up.

01:38:54.916 --> 01:38:56.144
The system's in lockdown.

01:38:56.317 --> 01:38:59.913
All calls in and out of this room
are secure, but it's the system...

01:39:00.088 --> 01:39:03.684
...that secures them.
Again, sir, it's in lockdown.

01:39:06.930 --> 01:39:09.262
- We're rebooting!
- Coming back up.

01:39:09.532 --> 01:39:11.762
Three minutes and counting!

01:39:18.742 --> 01:39:19.971
Two craps!

01:41:29.689 --> 01:41:31.522
Come on, eleven!

01:41:33.595 --> 01:41:35.495
Give me the dice.

01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:42.360
Hit them harder.

01:41:57.222 --> 01:42:00.714
Boys, I think our lucky
streak's just ended.

01:42:01.926 --> 01:42:03.154
Better cash them in, boys!

01:42:26.754 --> 01:42:28.085
Yes.

01:42:33.296 --> 01:42:35.230
All right, guys, shut her down.

01:42:35.398 --> 01:42:36.888
Shut her down!

01:42:37.067 --> 01:42:40.435
- She is shut down.
- No time for jokes, fellas.

01:42:40.604 --> 01:42:45.041
- Do I sound like I'm laughing, sweetheart?
- You think Nagel was...?

01:42:45.976 --> 01:42:47.203
Nah.

01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:13.203
Down the street. Safely, safely.
Right this way, everybody.

01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.532
Down the street, safely, please.

01:43:16.479 --> 01:43:19.538
Safely, right this way.
Right this way, everybody.

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.748
George, what are you doing?
The earthquake's over!

01:43:22.917 --> 01:43:25.043
They gotta get back!
We gotta get them back in!

01:43:25.219 --> 01:43:27.985
Sir, it's the evacuation plan. I....

01:43:32.562 --> 01:43:36.396
It's all over now. We can get back to us.

01:43:38.069 --> 01:43:40.765
- Feel my heart. Lenny, feel it.
- No-- What--?

01:43:41.906 --> 01:43:45.774
Oh, no. That's gonna stain.
Why don't we take these off?

01:43:45.944 --> 01:43:48.468
- It's white wine.
- Off. Get them off.

01:43:48.646 --> 01:43:52.242
- It's white wine! Oh, boy. Okay.
- Hold it right there!

01:43:52.752 --> 01:43:54.446
- FBI.
- Oh, dear God.

01:43:56.588 --> 01:43:57.954
Robert?

01:43:58.590 --> 01:44:01.651
This man, Lenny Pepperidge,
a.k.a. Lenny the Pep...

01:44:01.829 --> 01:44:05.559
...a.k.a. Sheldon Wills,
a.k.a. Little Timmy Hartwell...

01:44:05.732 --> 01:44:08.965
- ...is a confidence man.
- Okay, that's not the whole....

01:44:09.237 --> 01:44:10.726
- Help her up.
- Oh, my God.

01:44:10.972 --> 01:44:15.136
He infiltrates high-end establishments
through legitimate business contacts.

01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:19.244
He was gonna drug you and replace
the real diamonds with these.

01:44:19.982 --> 01:44:23.473
- My God. Oh, my God.
- And that's not all.

01:44:24.352 --> 01:44:26.115
No--!

01:44:28.925 --> 01:44:30.153
Oh, my God.

01:44:30.326 --> 01:44:32.852
Oh, Abby. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:44:33.397 --> 01:44:36.333
- No, I really like you.
- Shut up.

01:44:37.502 --> 01:44:40.096
- Oh, I am so finished.
- Don't let it bother you.

01:44:40.338 --> 01:44:44.434
- I'm finished.
- He's a professional at allaying suspicion.

01:44:44.676 --> 01:44:47.668
And seducing women of a certain age.

01:44:51.016 --> 01:44:53.610
You know, if Bank hears about this, I am....

01:44:53.852 --> 01:44:57.186
I'll be delicate in my report. Get her statement.

01:44:57.524 --> 01:44:59.516
Thank you, Agent Caldwell.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:02.685
I'll need your full name.

01:45:16.312 --> 01:45:17.869
Thank you.

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.141
I'm glad your mother
didn't have to see that.

01:45:21.317 --> 01:45:24.115
You just don't wanna admit the Brody played.

01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:26.755
It's a little early for a victory lap.

01:45:26.923 --> 01:45:29.358
I hate to break this up,
but did you make the switch?

01:45:29.526 --> 01:45:32.757
Yeah. Everything went according to plan.
We're heading to the roof.

01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:35.991
- Did you hear that?
- I'm ready.

01:45:39.806 --> 01:45:42.501
You know, it's not that I'm just
so desperate to celebrate.

01:45:42.742 --> 01:45:47.112
I need you to acknowledge that it wasn't
a prop for prop's sake. The nose played.

01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:49.680
And, in a way, it was kind
of perversely dignified.

01:45:49.915 --> 01:45:53.249
Look, let's just finish the job.

01:45:54.755 --> 01:45:56.586
There he is.

01:46:18.648 --> 01:46:21.516
Oh, what the hell? What the hell?

01:46:21.952 --> 01:46:23.283
Come on.

01:46:23.954 --> 01:46:25.978
Now, give me the diamonds.

01:46:26.723 --> 01:46:29.956
- Come on.
- Give him the diamonds.

01:46:49.482 --> 01:46:51.110
A gun?

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.653
Come on, let's go!

01:47:42.042 --> 01:47:46.376
Tough night. Half a
billion running out the door.

01:47:47.983 --> 01:47:50.382
Gonna roll over and die?

01:47:53.688 --> 01:47:55.622
You think you hit me.

01:47:59.929 --> 01:48:03.366
You don't even know
where my soft targets are.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.699
I'm still a two handicap
on a golf course, you know.

01:48:08.939 --> 01:48:13.205
I got the hottest new hotel on The Strip.

01:48:13.777 --> 01:48:16.805
And I'm a shoo-in
for the Five Diamond Award...

01:48:17.116 --> 01:48:18.344
...yet again.

01:48:18.517 --> 01:48:20.814
- You sure about that?
- Sure? I got that baby--

01:48:20.985 --> 01:48:22.419
All sewn up.

01:48:44.178 --> 01:48:47.410
This town might've changed, but not me.

01:48:48.785 --> 01:48:50.774
I'm gonna let you down.

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.955
I know people highly invested in my survival.

01:48:58.127 --> 01:49:02.029
And they are people who really know how to hurt.

01:49:02.199 --> 01:49:06.636
In ways you can't even imagine.

01:49:10.242 --> 01:49:14.542
Well, first, I know all the guys
that you'd hire to come after me.

01:49:14.713 --> 01:49:16.341
They like me better than you.

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:28.719
Second, you're not gonna
go to the cops because....

01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:31.023
Let's face it.
You're not gonna go to the cops.

01:49:36.805 --> 01:49:41.175
Third, you shook Sinatra's hand.

01:49:42.244 --> 01:49:44.768
You should know better, Willy.

01:50:09.408 --> 01:50:11.502
My diamonds.

01:50:32.466 --> 01:50:34.992
No, no, no.

01:51:36.874 --> 01:51:38.705
What's this?

01:51:39.009 --> 01:51:42.810
That's just the deed to 4.6 acres
of prime real estate...

01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:45.505
...at the north end of The Strip.

01:51:46.618 --> 01:51:50.519
The moment you become embarrassed
of who you are, you lose yourself.

01:51:50.689 --> 01:51:53.591
I changed my house, the
way I dressed, what I ate...

01:51:53.759 --> 01:51:56.489
...for what? For nothing.

01:51:57.362 --> 01:51:59.263
There he is.

01:52:00.734 --> 01:52:02.964
Thanks for those letters.

01:52:04.605 --> 01:52:06.800
They brought me back.

01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:14.348
You're more than welcome.

01:52:30.934 --> 01:52:32.834
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:52:33.002 --> 01:52:35.403
Looking for Terry. It's Danny Ocean.

01:52:44.049 --> 01:52:46.142
- Danny.
- Terry.

01:52:46.485 --> 01:52:48.283
You called an audible last night.

01:52:48.454 --> 01:52:50.421
That's what I do when I see a blitz coming.

01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:53.024
- A blitz?
- Toulour just happened to be on the roof...

01:52:53.192 --> 01:52:56.959
...at the exact moment that we were
coming out with those diamonds.

01:52:57.130 --> 01:53:00.430
- How'd you know I'd go for them?
- Because you're you and I'm me.

01:53:00.868 --> 01:53:05.101
We were watching Toulour
while you had him watching us.

01:53:09.077 --> 01:53:12.912
This is your end, which
you donated to charity.

01:53:14.783 --> 01:53:16.718
- Charity?
- Camp To Belong.

01:53:16.886 --> 01:53:20.187
The kids are grateful. They're gonna
have you up to visit next month.

01:53:28.164 --> 01:53:30.565
Now, you know that wasn't our deal.

01:53:31.569 --> 01:53:35.005
If you feel that strongly about it,
we'll yank the kids out of the camp...

01:53:35.173 --> 01:53:39.611
...and send them back
to their foster homes, all 200 of them.

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:46.146
- You think this is funny?
- Well, Terry, it sure as shit ain't sad.

01:53:53.928 --> 01:53:55.920
Why these children?

01:53:56.530 --> 01:54:00.261
Well, I was just very moved by
the kind of work they're doing there.

01:54:00.435 --> 01:54:01.925
And you gotta start somewhere.

01:54:02.103 --> 01:54:04.971
And luckily, you know,
the casino business is doing well...

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:07.234
...and I hope there's
more millions to come...

01:54:07.410 --> 01:54:09.810
... that we can spread around
to other organizations.

01:54:09.979 --> 01:54:13.915
But like I said, I was
very moved by that place.

01:54:14.084 --> 01:54:17.451
All you gotta do is look
inside a child's eyes and....

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:22.354
And that's all it needs--
That's all the motivation that one needs.

01:54:22.526 --> 01:54:25.052
- Well, thank you for being an angel for us.
- Thank you.

01:54:25.230 --> 01:54:29.393
- Like I said, I'm just following her lead.
- Thank you. Terry Benedict. We'll be back.

01:54:37.744 --> 01:54:42.079
Well, I gotta jump. My dad's working
a frame. He's got a part for me in it.

01:54:45.986 --> 01:54:48.387
- Congratulations.
- Nice going.

01:54:56.498 --> 01:54:58.431
See you when I see you.

01:55:09.545 --> 01:55:12.071
So I guess it's just the
Susan B. Anthony, then, again.

01:55:12.249 --> 01:55:13.477
I never get tired of it.

01:55:13.650 --> 01:55:16.313
- Can't get too close. He's probably still--
- Right.

01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:19.757
So....

01:55:21.425 --> 01:55:23.587
See you when I see you.

01:55:25.230 --> 01:55:29.360
Hey, next time try keeping
the weight off in between.

01:55:32.939 --> 01:55:35.908
You ought to settle down,
have a couple of kids.

01:55:44.452 --> 01:55:48.821
- We'll be calling standbys in a few minutes.
- Please.

01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:51.116
Please, I gotta get out of here.

01:55:51.290 --> 01:55:54.319
Maybe you'll get lucky this time.

01:56:10.548 --> 01:56:13.313
Hey, you dropped these.

01:56:13.485 --> 01:56:15.146
Go ahead. I got a plane to catch.

01:56:15.319 --> 01:56:18.414
Actually, try this one.
It's been paying out.

01:56:26.232 --> 01:56:28.666
I won! Look at this!

01:56:28.834 --> 01:56:32.396
I won $11 million. Can you believe it?

01:56:32.572 --> 01:56:36.100
Look at that! I won $11 million. Did you see that?

01:56:36.276 --> 01:56:37.505
I can't believe it!
