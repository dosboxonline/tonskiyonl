00:27.625 --> 00:30.541
No way, man.
I'm not getting involved in crime and--

00:30.625 --> 00:32.666
What fucking crime?

00:32.750 --> 00:34.875
It's practically legal, damn it.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.875
The gray market of cargo
is where it's at, pilot.

00:48.583 --> 00:52.125
We get in, make some serious cash,
and then get the fuck out.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.750
I knew it was shady shit!

00:53.833 --> 00:56.500
Do you have any idea
how fucking risky this is?

01:00.791 --> 01:03.583
You can feel their speed
through your screen!

01:08.833 --> 01:12.083
The whole pack's on the final stretch
to complete another lap.

01:12.166 --> 01:13.500
They're all bunched together.

01:13.583 --> 01:16.916
What a fiercely contested BR Truck season.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.250
OVERHAUL

01:22.000 --> 01:24.166
6 MONTHS EARLIER

01:27.500 --> 01:32.333
Roger's on the offensive!
Just like that, he overtakes Huggo.

01:37.791 --> 01:41.750
Roger, straight line ahead.
Mind the radar, limit's 160 kph.

01:43.166 --> 01:44.208
Shit!

01:46.458 --> 01:47.708
157 KPH

01:48.583 --> 01:50.958
Take it easy, you're still in third.

01:51.041 --> 01:52.416
Not for long.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.166
We'll see.
If you win, beer's on me tonight.

01:55.250 --> 01:59.083
Roger's right behind Andreas and Paccioli.
They're close together.

01:59.166 --> 02:04.500
It's three wide on the back straightaway.
Roger comes in hot to make the pass!

02:06.625 --> 02:07.666
Nice!

02:08.375 --> 02:09.416
All right!

02:09.500 --> 02:10.875
You owe me a beer.

02:10.958 --> 02:13.333
It's not over yet.
The Queen is coming for you.

02:13.416 --> 02:15.000
Dad, the turbo's overheating.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.041
Don't push it. Just let her through.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.750
Fuck, she's overtaken me!

02:19.833 --> 02:23.333
I told you. Now relax.
You can't catch her anymore.

02:23.416 --> 02:25.500
Afraid you'll owe me a beer?

02:25.583 --> 02:27.541
Forget the beer. You'll wreck the truck.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.000
I know my truck. It can handle it.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.125
I know it better.

02:31.208 --> 02:32.291
Wanna bet?

02:32.375 --> 02:33.541
-It's a bet.
-Dad!

02:33.625 --> 02:35.041
He might pull it off. Wait.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.750
He might, but his truck won't.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.083
I'm falling behind! I'll go for it.

03:04.375 --> 03:07.375
Roger's turbo has blown up again!

03:07.458 --> 03:09.291
With Roger Mattos out,

03:09.375 --> 03:13.208
Débora the Queen
is coming for another win!

03:14.166 --> 03:15.208
Fuck.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.083
We just got this fixed, Roger.

03:33.166 --> 03:36.125
-This truck sucks.
-Only 'cause you keep pushing it.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.875
It's busted.

03:39.416 --> 03:42.791
The Queen is ready
to celebrate another win!

03:42.875 --> 03:46.750
Four races, four wins,
and a commanding lead in the championship.

03:50.666 --> 03:52.916
She's so amazing!

03:53.666 --> 03:54.916
Hey, come over here.

03:55.916 --> 03:58.375
She's the best.
Let's take a picture with her.

03:58.458 --> 04:00.333
Great race. I was rooting for you.

04:00.416 --> 04:01.458
That's awesome!

04:04.125 --> 04:05.166
Hey.

04:05.916 --> 04:07.250
Is that your daughter?

04:08.375 --> 04:11.958
Nope. That's Danilo's daughter.
He's my best friend.

04:12.041 --> 04:12.875
What's up?

04:14.041 --> 04:15.541
My kid's a big fan of hers, too.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.541
-She was trying to get a pic.
-Oh, yeah?

04:17.625 --> 04:18.541
Did you get it?

04:18.625 --> 04:20.041
-Yup.
-Really?

04:20.666 --> 04:22.958
-I'm Afonso. Big fan.
-Nice to meet you.

04:24.416 --> 04:25.416
I appreciate it.

04:25.916 --> 04:27.958
Can we take a picture?

04:28.041 --> 04:29.125
Sure, let's do it.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.625
Can we take it in front of your truck?

04:32.708 --> 04:33.583
C'mon.

04:38.666 --> 04:40.333
This is the man, Jorge.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.875
Be right back, baby. Wait for me.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.208
-What's up, my Queen!
-She's not yours.

05:00.541 --> 05:01.625
What's up, Roger?

05:03.291 --> 05:05.083
Aren't you gonna offer me one?

05:16.458 --> 05:17.791
I'm just chilling,

05:18.375 --> 05:20.833
minding my own, in peace.

05:22.916 --> 05:23.958
Great mood.

05:26.208 --> 05:28.041
I take it you know the reason.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.750
Roger, I came to congratulate you.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.250
I'm serious.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.583
You had an amazing race.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.041
When you overtook me…

05:40.750 --> 05:42.458
Even I didn't know if I'd manage to--

05:42.541 --> 05:43.583
But you did.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.500
Débora, why are you here?

05:49.250 --> 05:50.833
To make fun of me? Is that it?

05:57.333 --> 05:59.666
I got my hopes up, but…

06:01.416 --> 06:03.250
I guess you still don't get it.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.041
Spoiled brat.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.875
-What was that?
-Spoiled brat!

06:07.958 --> 06:10.708
-You're still a spoiled brat!
-Like hell I am!

06:10.791 --> 06:12.750
I've been working since I was 14.

06:12.833 --> 06:13.666
Really?

06:14.791 --> 06:17.333
Where? On your daddy's racing team?

06:17.833 --> 06:20.541
Grow up, Roger. Then you can talk to me.

06:24.541 --> 06:27.916
Do you think you can complain?
I have a daughter, Roger.

06:28.708 --> 06:31.791
School, computer classes,
English lessons. A whole lot of shit.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.916
If only I had someone to share the bills.
But I'm all Bárbara's got.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.291
That's why we need to get back on top.

06:42.833 --> 06:45.916
We need a competitive truck
that won't screw me over on the last lap.

06:46.000 --> 06:46.958
Talk to your dad yet?

06:47.958 --> 06:49.416
Shit, not yet, Danilo.

06:49.916 --> 06:53.583
Still figuring out how to bring it up.
You know how my old man is.

06:53.666 --> 06:54.875
Yeah, damn…

06:54.958 --> 06:57.166
Listen, man. One thing is for sure.

06:57.875 --> 07:02.250
Once we have the money to fix the turbo,
that championship is mine.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.916
-I don't know, Roger.
-What do you mean, Danilo?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.666
My old man just needs
to invest more in the team.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.791
My point exactly.
What if he stops helping you?

07:10.875 --> 07:12.208
-Doesn't matter.
-It does.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.333
It changes everything and you know it.

07:16.833 --> 07:20.166
What's the point of having these rides
if they can't drive?

07:22.291 --> 07:24.416
Let's see how the car is
after your fuck-up.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.958
It got fucked up
after you tampered with it.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.958
Sure, Roger. Yeah, thanks a lot.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.000
Hey, trucker!

07:34.083 --> 07:35.833
Fuck, these guys won't give up.

07:35.916 --> 07:38.125
-Can this junk race?
-Not against you.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.541
C'mon, the streets are clear.
Or can you only drive trucks?

07:41.625 --> 07:45.625
-Say hi to your daughter for me.
-What was that, motherfucker?

07:53.083 --> 07:55.541
-We'd totally catch them if I was driving.
-Oh yeah?

08:06.125 --> 08:07.458
Shit, Danilo!

08:08.250 --> 08:10.750
Be thankful I'm retired.
I'd put you to shame.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.416
Sure, Danilo. Try your luck.

08:17.791 --> 08:19.666
Step on it!

08:32.708 --> 08:34.416
Straight line. Let's get them.

08:54.916 --> 08:55.791
Damn it!

08:55.875 --> 08:57.375
-Holy fuck.
-You okay?

08:57.458 --> 08:59.375
-Yeah, but now what?
-Let's switch seats.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.541
-Are you insane?
-Just do it.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.458
We've been drinking, this is my car,
and I won't let you take the fall. C'mon!

09:05.541 --> 09:06.666
You coward!

09:10.041 --> 09:14.458
RIO DE JANEIRO PD
183RD PRECINCT

09:28.416 --> 09:30.125
I wasn't the one who crashed the car.

09:31.541 --> 09:32.916
I switched places with Danilo.

09:36.875 --> 09:40.000
You know how the cops
are really fucking nice to Black people.

09:40.958 --> 09:44.416
-Fuck him.
-C'mon, he has a daughter to raise.

09:44.500 --> 09:48.625
You're ruining the racing team I built.

09:48.708 --> 09:50.375
A team that's falling apart.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.250
What was that, you brat? What was that?

09:54.333 --> 09:55.875
It fucking is, though.

09:55.958 --> 09:57.791
And don't call me a brat!

09:57.875 --> 10:00.875
That's what you are.
You don't know a thing about life, Roger.

10:00.958 --> 10:03.458
You've still got
so much learning and growing to do.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.291
How can I grow in this shitty team?

10:10.375 --> 10:13.041
I should just join a real team.

10:13.708 --> 10:16.000
You go ahead, son.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.083
But I'll tell you what.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.958
You're nothing without me.

10:20.041 --> 10:21.500
You aren't shit!

10:21.583 --> 10:24.000
You think you're the shit,
but you're fucking useless!

10:24.083 --> 10:27.791
-You're finally going to realize it.
-We'll see who's fucking right.

10:29.291 --> 10:31.916
Out. Get out of my car.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.708
You'll see!

10:36.791 --> 10:40.583
I'm gonna win, and you'll regret
everything you've just said!

10:40.666 --> 10:42.708
-Go fuck yourself!
-You'll regret this!

10:42.791 --> 10:45.541
Fuck you, Roger! You'll fuck it all up!

10:45.625 --> 10:47.500
You little piece of shit!

11:07.958 --> 11:09.083
Dad!

11:09.583 --> 11:11.333
For the love of God, talk to me.

11:13.458 --> 11:14.916
Talk to me, Dad!

11:15.833 --> 11:17.041
Dad!

11:17.125 --> 11:18.833
Help!

11:20.916 --> 11:22.583
Someone help!

12:05.875 --> 12:10.125
Ready? One, two, three… I'm coming!

12:10.708 --> 12:12.125
Go hide, son.

12:13.833 --> 12:17.666
I'm so proud of you.
I think you'll be a champion one day.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.333
I know it. You're killing it.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.250
Historical race for BR Truck.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.833
Mario Mattos
gets his son Roger in the truck.

12:23.916 --> 12:26.958
Father and son together on the circuit.

12:37.708 --> 12:41.500
That's BR Truck history
being written right there.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.416
Mario Mattos is the champion!

12:46.458 --> 12:50.666
He gets the checkered flag.
Better get a bigger shelf for that trophy!

12:50.750 --> 12:54.625
Mario Mattos,
three-time BR Truck champion!

13:25.125 --> 13:28.250
Can I get you some water? Or coffee?

13:32.291 --> 13:34.250
So, Roger, here's the thing.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.125
The shop is going bankrupt.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.708
That's why your father
was always so tense.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.041
God dammit.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.875
Your father owed a lot of money.
But mostly to companies.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.916
The only exception is Odilon.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Odilon?

14:17.333 --> 14:20.166
What are you doing?
Wanna blow yourself up with the truck?

14:21.125 --> 14:23.125
This won't bring your father back.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.250
It has to be replaced.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.458
It's unsalvageable.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.083
Can't you just jerry-rig it?

14:43.166 --> 14:45.833
Nope. If it breaks again, it's on me.

14:45.916 --> 14:48.375
-And it's expensive.
-Of course it is.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.000
Why don't you talk to Odilon?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.958
-About what?
-The turbo.

14:54.541 --> 14:56.625
I won't deal with Odilon.

14:57.416 --> 14:59.083
I'll figure it out.

15:00.791 --> 15:02.333
I'll talk to the sponsors.

15:02.958 --> 15:04.625
-I'll go after Toledo.
-Cool.

15:21.916 --> 15:23.000
What's up, Toledo?

15:24.416 --> 15:25.625
Roger!

15:28.166 --> 15:29.666
Get him a shot too.

15:30.583 --> 15:34.666
This one is special. Extremely rare.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.750
To this extraordinary championship.

15:38.833 --> 15:39.916
To the future!

15:40.000 --> 15:41.375
And only God knows about it!

15:42.125 --> 15:44.625
Toledo, nice running into you.
I wanted to talk--

15:44.708 --> 15:47.208
We want to talk to you, too.

15:48.291 --> 15:49.583
We've made a decision--

15:49.666 --> 15:52.000
We've also made a decision, you know.

15:54.375 --> 15:55.333
Good.

15:56.375 --> 15:57.333
Very good.

16:00.041 --> 16:01.041
Roger,

16:01.791 --> 16:04.416
you know we really admire BR Truck.

16:05.916 --> 16:07.375
But with this crisis…

16:07.458 --> 16:10.458
As you know, our country
is going through a rough patch.

16:11.375 --> 16:12.833
What are you talking about?

16:12.916 --> 16:15.958
We are ending your sponsorship.

16:16.541 --> 16:17.916
We can't do this.

16:19.833 --> 16:22.000
No. This isn't happening.

16:25.708 --> 16:26.625
Thanks.

16:38.166 --> 16:39.500
How's it going, Roger?

16:40.125 --> 16:41.166
All good, man?

16:42.333 --> 16:43.333
What is it?

16:43.416 --> 16:46.666
-Do I know you?
-No, I was sent by Odilon.

16:47.166 --> 16:51.083
You father was late on his payment.
Old man kept dodging us.

16:52.458 --> 16:54.666
Show some respect
when talking about my father.

16:54.750 --> 16:59.125
You show respect by paying his debts
and finishing what he started, got it?

17:00.166 --> 17:01.916
I wasn't involved in his business.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.833
Then just pay his debts, bro.

17:03.916 --> 17:06.958
Or his business will come to you,
whether you want it or not.

17:10.833 --> 17:11.875
You heard me.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.541
Damn, kid.
Forgot how to slow down for the curve?

17:59.625 --> 18:02.166
Danilo warned me,
but I tried something different.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.416
If the coach is the problem,
we'll hire another.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.583
That's not it.

18:06.458 --> 18:07.458
It's okay.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.208
Then why aren't you winning?

18:10.291 --> 18:14.375
I don't know. The equipment…
The team's feeling uneasy.

18:14.458 --> 18:18.166
Look, I'll invest more.
I just need to organize, but I'll do it.

18:19.125 --> 18:20.541
The thing is…

18:21.458 --> 18:22.875
the shop's not doing great.

18:26.291 --> 18:27.375
Are you in debt?

18:31.625 --> 18:32.625
How much?

18:35.416 --> 18:36.625
Go race, Roger.

18:38.541 --> 18:40.708
This is not your problem. Forget it.

18:40.791 --> 18:43.333
I can deal with my problems on my own.

18:44.541 --> 18:48.458
On your own?
Or with the help of that damn mobster?

18:51.916 --> 18:55.083
Roger, Odilon is not a bad man.
He's just eccentric.

18:55.166 --> 18:57.750
He's basically a 1970s gangster.

18:57.833 --> 19:01.333
Son, you have to understand
that when you're out of options,

19:01.416 --> 19:02.875
when you're fucked,

19:03.791 --> 19:05.833
Odilon is the only way out.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.458
It's Roger.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.583
Afternoon, sir.

19:34.666 --> 19:36.083
Your whiskey, sir.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.500
Thank you, Jordan.

19:40.541 --> 19:41.500
That's all.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.750
But Roger…

19:47.833 --> 19:52.458
Did your father leave you anything else?

19:52.541 --> 19:54.583
I mean, in terms of possessions.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.833
A debt-ridden shop.

20:00.791 --> 20:06.750
Perhaps you could give it to me
to pay off some of the debt.

20:09.416 --> 20:12.791
-Come again? "Some" of it?
-It wouldn't cover the whole thing.

20:12.875 --> 20:17.416
But you could pay off the rest
in installments.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.125
Shit, Odilon.

20:19.625 --> 20:23.541
C'mon, you know I have a team to run.
You know the cost of that.

20:23.625 --> 20:30.500
I do. And that's why I think it's time
you start making some cash on the side.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.250
If you know what I mean.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.666
I'm a racing driver.
I don't know how to do much else.

20:37.750 --> 20:38.958
Oh, you'd be driving.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.958
You'd be driving for a business
I had with your father.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.916
You'd earn a lot more

20:44.000 --> 20:47.958
and wouldn't be tied
to those cheap-ass sponsors.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.333
Come on… No way.

20:52.416 --> 20:55.000
I'm not getting involved in crime and--

20:55.083 --> 20:57.583
What fucking crime?

20:58.208 --> 21:00.708
Are you calling me a crook, Roger? Fuck!

21:01.333 --> 21:06.000
It's the gray market of cargo.
It's practically legal, damn it.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.708
If you came all this way,

21:07.791 --> 21:10.458
you knew very well
what you were getting into.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.083
I don't know, Odilon.
I'm not used to this stuff.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.833
You'll learn.

21:16.916 --> 21:19.875
I'll put you in touch
with my associate, Smokey.

21:19.958 --> 21:21.416
You can decide then.

21:39.791 --> 21:42.541
What's up, my man? Make yourself at home.

21:43.041 --> 21:44.125
Turn it down, man.

21:47.750 --> 21:50.583
So nice to meet you. I mean it.

21:50.666 --> 21:52.916
Odilon's always talking about you.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.333
The gray market of cargo
is where it's at, pilot.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.375
The goods already have a destination.

22:00.458 --> 22:03.083
It's a sure thing,
with a destination and a buyer.

22:03.166 --> 22:05.875
And after the stuff
is distributed in the city,

22:06.458 --> 22:08.041
we're clean as a whistle.

22:08.125 --> 22:11.916
And when all is said and done,
insurance covers it.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.541
So it's barely illegal, basically.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.041
But hear me out, Smokey…

22:17.416 --> 22:20.416
I'm just the wheelman.
It's the only thing I can do well.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.541
Sure, and that's exactly what we need.

22:23.625 --> 22:26.541
Sick and tired of losing money
'cause of some useless clowns.

22:26.625 --> 22:29.541
But I can see you're a solid guy.

22:30.125 --> 22:33.500
All you need now
is a co-pilot you can trust, got it?

22:35.791 --> 22:38.083
Insurance covers everything.
It's barely illegal.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.291
-Sure, Roger…
-I have to do it.

22:40.375 --> 22:42.291
Can't have everyone getting fired.

22:42.375 --> 22:43.625
All these jobs.

22:44.958 --> 22:47.208
I can't pay Odilon otherwise.
I have to do it.

22:47.291 --> 22:49.458
-You're not thinking straight.
-And you are?

22:49.541 --> 22:51.500
-Yup.
-What about Bárbara?

22:51.583 --> 22:53.208
What about her, Roger?

22:53.291 --> 22:55.583
Danilo, the season is underway.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.833
If I go broke, what happens to your job?

22:57.916 --> 22:59.291
I found the part.

22:59.791 --> 23:03.125
Yo, Fox. Take a breather, okay?
We're in the middle of something.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.041
Sure thing.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.333
Think about it.

23:06.416 --> 23:08.541
We get in, make a bunch of money,

23:08.625 --> 23:10.541
put some of it here in the team.

23:11.583 --> 23:14.458
We grow, we attract new sponsors.

23:14.541 --> 23:16.166
Then we get the fuck out.

23:16.250 --> 23:17.333
Man…

23:17.416 --> 23:18.541
It's just for a while.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.875
If you don't like what they have to say,
we don't do it.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.958
But let's hear them out, okay?

23:25.041 --> 23:26.875
Roger, we need to--

23:26.958 --> 23:29.000
I'll go grab it.

23:33.458 --> 23:34.375
Hey.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.875
My condolences on your father's passing.

23:38.875 --> 23:42.250
-If you need something or someone to talk…
-Thanks.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.666
-I'm not just saying that.
-I know, Débora.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.208
Thanks for offering to help.

23:49.291 --> 23:52.583
I just don't know if I can be helped.

23:53.666 --> 23:54.500
Sorry.

24:05.416 --> 24:07.291
We oversee things from here.

24:07.375 --> 24:12.000
We usually have you
share your live location

24:12.083 --> 24:13.750
so we can keep track of you.

24:13.833 --> 24:17.916
We own all the phones and the cargo.
It's all clean.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.208
No illegal shit.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.333
-Am I right, Sketch?
-Sure thing, boss.

24:23.416 --> 24:25.125
This is Sketch, my right-hand man.

24:25.208 --> 24:27.250
He distributes our goods.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.125
Only the best stuff.

24:29.208 --> 24:31.000
We only deal with high-value cargo.

24:31.083 --> 24:33.916
We leave meat and stuff to amateurs.

24:34.416 --> 24:39.291
We like working with electronics.
Smartphones, computers, tablets.

24:39.375 --> 24:41.750
You know how much we get
for a truckful of phones?

24:41.833 --> 24:43.333
Here's the thing.

24:43.416 --> 24:45.708
We need to be smooth,
know what I'm saying?

24:45.791 --> 24:47.625
Once we get to the storage,

24:47.708 --> 24:50.250
we need time to disassemble it.

24:50.333 --> 24:51.500
Here's the catch.

24:52.416 --> 24:56.375
Every high-value cargo truck
has a safety device in the driver's cab.

24:56.458 --> 25:01.625
When triggered, everything locks
and we can forget taking the cargo.

25:01.708 --> 25:05.666
Our goal is to make the driver pull over

25:05.750 --> 25:09.000
and leave the cab
without setting off the device.

25:09.083 --> 25:12.916
The best way to do so is by talking.
No violence.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.375
We don't want any blood, after all.

25:15.458 --> 25:16.833
Only sometimes, right, boss?

25:16.916 --> 25:18.500
Shut the fuck up, Sketch.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.458
This is serious shit. Show some respect.

25:22.541 --> 25:25.500
-Grease the driver's palm before leaving…
-For me?

25:25.583 --> 25:27.958
…so he doesn't warn the insurer
right away.

25:28.041 --> 25:30.166
It's a win-win situation, you know?

25:33.666 --> 25:36.375
Once behind the wheels, shit gets serious.

25:36.458 --> 25:38.250
Every piece of cargo is tracked,

25:38.333 --> 25:41.333
so the cops are bound
to show up eventually.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.541
-Shit, Danilo! Checkpoint!
-Turn right, Roger!

25:48.625 --> 25:51.958
You have a 15-minute window
to reach the unloading site

25:52.041 --> 25:54.708
without getting caught.
That's where your skills come in.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.666
You need steady hands and quick reflexes.

25:57.750 --> 26:00.083
The routes are winding and time is short.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.708
We've lost tons of cargo
because of lousy drivers

26:08.791 --> 26:11.250
who let the truck flip over
and lost everything.

26:11.333 --> 26:12.875
Fuck-ups are better off dead.

26:16.916 --> 26:20.583
If you manage to take the cargo
all the way to the destination,

26:20.666 --> 26:21.500
then you did a--

26:21.583 --> 26:23.791
Good job, you two!

26:23.875 --> 26:27.291
Well done. Flawless execution.

26:27.958 --> 26:29.333
-Want some?
-I'm good.

26:29.416 --> 26:31.458
I'd rather have thighs today.

26:33.958 --> 26:34.833
Yo, man.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.208
Hold this.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.500
Just like you two, I'm a man of my word.

26:40.916 --> 26:42.333
Isn't that what you wanted?

26:42.833 --> 26:46.041
I'd invite you both in, but it's tight.
You won't fit.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.833
Now it'll be good to go.

26:51.416 --> 26:53.666
I'll set it up.
Are you gonna help me or what?

26:54.166 --> 26:55.416
Good luck with that.

26:56.375 --> 27:01.250
All right, Roger.
We need to make it in 1:51.451.

27:02.625 --> 27:04.416
That's the pole position time.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.750
It's up to you, bro. You can do it!

27:12.458 --> 27:14.416
It seems like the tweak worked.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.916
Split time: 1:18.130.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.500
What's wrong, Roger? C'mon!

27:25.583 --> 27:26.583
I got this, Danilo.

27:30.333 --> 27:31.541
Let me see.

27:39.666 --> 27:43.375
Your lap time is 1:50.530.
Good job! You've got pole!

27:49.541 --> 27:51.958
We're doing it! Good job today.

27:52.041 --> 27:55.000
Hey, we need to remove that shit.
Toledo's dropped us.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.916
-You got it, boss.
-Well done, kid.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.166
-Off to work, you guys.
-Let's do it.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.375
You do great
when you're all by yourself, huh?

28:05.458 --> 28:08.375
I'll finish first all by myself too,
Débora.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.708
You made good time.

28:11.875 --> 28:14.041
But guess who holds the record
for this circuit?

28:15.166 --> 28:16.666
Were you watching my practice?

28:17.208 --> 28:18.041
Yup.

28:19.666 --> 28:21.208
You looked confident today.

28:21.708 --> 28:23.958
I have a feeling things might look up.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.708
Of course they might.
You got what it takes to come in second.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.541
-We'll see about that in the next race.
-Okay, then.

28:33.041 --> 28:35.541
Just don't stray too far.
I wanna be able to see you.

28:36.125 --> 28:38.125
I told you it was gonna work out.

28:38.208 --> 28:40.500
I'm not sure this is the life I want.

28:41.333 --> 28:42.958
I don't wanna get arrested.

28:44.041 --> 28:48.250
Do you really think the cops can catch you
with their shitty cars?

28:48.333 --> 28:49.500
You're a racing driver!

28:49.583 --> 28:52.458
That's my point.
I'm a racing driver, not a criminal.

28:52.541 --> 28:53.375
So you-- Ouch!

28:56.000 --> 28:57.500
Fuck, Jordan.

28:57.583 --> 29:00.083
Trim the nails, not the fucking toes.

29:01.458 --> 29:06.500
Do you think the insurance company
calls the cops through that device?

29:07.250 --> 29:10.625
Hey, if it turns on,
it can be turned off, right?

29:10.708 --> 29:11.875
Meaning?

29:12.958 --> 29:14.833
I have an inside guy.

29:14.916 --> 29:17.500
He can help us with that. Trust me.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.041
-Hey.
-What's up?

29:20.541 --> 29:22.916
Souza's a business partner.

29:24.208 --> 29:26.458
Some things can only be managed

29:27.291 --> 29:28.666
in the middle of the night.

29:28.750 --> 29:32.000
Certainly. We're glad to work
after hours for a client like you.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.541
Let me walk you through
exactly how it works.

29:37.625 --> 29:40.541
As for turning it off… That's on you.

29:41.833 --> 29:44.083
Got any ideas on avoiding arrest, Danilo?

29:44.166 --> 29:45.666
We jump ship.

29:46.375 --> 29:49.500
Come on, man.
We've got two different problems.

29:49.583 --> 29:52.916
The immobilizer system in the cab
that locks the wheels,

29:53.416 --> 29:56.375
and the GPS that's inside the trailer.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.666
To deal with the first problem,
we have to uncouple the trailer.

30:05.750 --> 30:09.583
First we cut the Suzi coil
between the cab and the trailer.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.750
This should force the driver to pull over.

30:15.458 --> 30:17.541
Won't he just lock it all up
then and there?

30:17.625 --> 30:19.541
Yeah, but don't worry.

30:19.625 --> 30:21.916
I have something to uncouple the trailer.

30:23.666 --> 30:25.041
Check out our new gear.

30:26.583 --> 30:29.583
-Did you build it yourself?
-I modded it.

30:29.666 --> 30:30.583
Attaboy.

30:40.458 --> 30:41.666
Pull!

30:42.666 --> 30:43.625
Go ahead!

30:45.875 --> 30:46.708
Come on!

30:47.791 --> 30:50.625
And how do we stop the container
from being tracked?

30:50.708 --> 30:52.750
That's why I brought this thing.

30:53.833 --> 30:55.625
It's an all-purpose signal jammer.

30:57.791 --> 30:59.708
-It's called a deflector.
-A what?

30:59.791 --> 31:03.083
A deflector, man. All we have to do
is attach it to the container,

31:03.166 --> 31:04.541
and the signal is blocked.

31:04.625 --> 31:07.875
Then we can drive it around
without being tracked.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.541
Now you're talking!

31:11.625 --> 31:15.083
Roger's first victory is ever so close!

31:23.708 --> 31:24.666
SHARE LOCATION

31:24.750 --> 31:25.750
Here it is, Smokey.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.583
INCOMING CALL
SMOKEY

31:44.375 --> 31:48.083
Roger's on a roll here!
He's coming in fast!

31:53.958 --> 31:54.958
Fuck yeah!

31:55.583 --> 31:59.166
You've got to give it to Roger
for the great job his team's been doing.

32:22.666 --> 32:24.625
Shut the fucking door, dude.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.541
Grilling lemon, Danilo?

32:40.625 --> 32:42.833
-It's just for seasoning.
-Let me taste it.

32:43.583 --> 32:44.500
So?

32:45.333 --> 32:46.250
You're the man.

32:47.208 --> 32:49.041
-Hey, Danilo.
-Good job, man.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.791
Thanks, dude. We've got this.

32:51.458 --> 32:53.708
-Congrats!
-Thank you.

32:53.791 --> 32:55.875
-Roger, can we take a selfie?
-Sure.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.375
-Thanks, bud.
-Thanks.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.041
What's up?

33:02.916 --> 33:04.041
You did good today.

33:05.208 --> 33:06.083
Thank you.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.250
You sure are on a high.

33:09.125 --> 33:10.458
-Yeah.
-Right?

33:10.541 --> 33:12.250
I sold my dad's shop.

33:12.333 --> 33:13.541
Gotcha.

33:14.583 --> 33:15.666
Was it in dollars?

33:18.083 --> 33:19.291
Seriously, Débora?

33:19.958 --> 33:20.916
No, for real.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.458
You got rid of that junk shop

33:23.541 --> 33:25.583
and renovated
your whole team from scratch?

33:25.666 --> 33:29.000
-Don't I deserve to catch a break?
-"Catch a break," Roger?

33:30.250 --> 33:34.375
You've got no sponsors,
and I know how costly this whole thing is.

33:34.458 --> 33:37.833
-Look at your uniforms!
-What are you trying to suggest?

33:37.916 --> 33:40.833
Weren't we getting along just fine?

33:40.916 --> 33:42.166
Why pull this now?

33:42.666 --> 33:46.125
Precisely so that we can continue
to get along just fine.

33:46.750 --> 33:47.708
What's going on?

33:49.541 --> 33:53.583
Things are going my way
for the first time in my life, is all.

33:53.666 --> 33:54.583
Is that right?

33:55.708 --> 33:56.750
In an honest way?

34:12.083 --> 34:14.708
-Was she picking a fight?
-She sure was.

34:15.708 --> 34:19.791
She was all up my ass,
questioning our upgrade.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.291
Yeah, about that, man…

34:24.083 --> 34:25.333
I think we're done.

34:26.750 --> 34:27.750
What do you mean?

34:27.833 --> 34:31.708
We said we'd be in and out.
It's time to get out, right?

34:33.541 --> 34:34.708
You're right, man.

34:34.791 --> 34:38.333
Next one is our last run.
We make one last killing and…

34:39.541 --> 34:40.666
we're out for good.

34:42.541 --> 34:45.125
Right when I came up with a way
to pull off the heist

34:45.208 --> 34:46.583
with the truck in motion.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.166
No stopping the driver,
no locking the cab.

34:50.541 --> 34:52.500
All we need is the right terrain.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.666
Get real close to the cab.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.083
Okay, keep it steady!

35:03.750 --> 35:04.958
Get closer.

35:06.583 --> 35:07.500
Off I go!

35:54.791 --> 35:57.791
Holy shit! Fuck!

35:57.875 --> 35:59.916
Danilo? Everything okay?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.500
It's not fucking working!

36:02.375 --> 36:03.708
Roger!

36:03.791 --> 36:06.416
Come after me! It's not fucking working!

36:10.708 --> 36:12.666
Hurry the fuck up, Roger!

36:13.333 --> 36:14.291
Fuck!

36:15.250 --> 36:16.500
Holy fucking shit!

36:18.166 --> 36:19.416
Here!

36:20.041 --> 36:21.458
Right here.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.916
Closer! Jesus fuck, come closer!

36:27.000 --> 36:29.250
Come on, Roger, fuck!

36:30.875 --> 36:32.708
Holy shit, Roger!

36:32.791 --> 36:35.291
Now, come on! Fucking hell!

36:38.083 --> 36:39.375
Perfect, man!

36:40.041 --> 36:41.541
Go, go, go!

36:43.416 --> 36:44.583
Now!

36:55.750 --> 37:00.250
Yeah! Holy fucking shit! I made it!

37:00.333 --> 37:02.041
I made it alive, Roger!

37:02.125 --> 37:04.625
-You just--
-Danilo!

37:04.708 --> 37:06.625
Turn the jammer on and let's go.

37:06.708 --> 37:08.041
Fuck, that was messy.

37:09.291 --> 37:11.000
-Hurry up.
-Let's go.

37:25.541 --> 37:26.666
Holy fuck, Roger.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.500
I thought I was gonna bite the dust.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.083
Damn.

37:41.666 --> 37:44.083
Danilo. Fuck, there's a checkpoint.

37:44.708 --> 37:45.625
I'm pulling over.

37:45.708 --> 37:47.708
Are you crazy? I don't wanna go to jail!

37:48.708 --> 37:50.750
-Just go!
-What should I do?

37:50.833 --> 37:52.416
Run it over, Roger! Do it!

37:55.833 --> 37:57.208
Don't dodge them!

38:03.208 --> 38:05.291
Danilo? Are you all right?

38:17.375 --> 38:18.208
Danilo.

38:21.916 --> 38:24.500
Fuck, bro. You've been shot.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
What the hell?

38:26.875 --> 38:27.833
Danilo!

38:29.666 --> 38:30.666
Danilo, fuck!

38:31.208 --> 38:32.666
-Talk to me.
-Fuck, Bárbara…

38:32.750 --> 38:34.375
Hey, hey! Danilo!

38:35.375 --> 38:38.083
Keep talking to me! Keep talking!

38:39.666 --> 38:42.833
Danilo, stay with me.
We'll get to the hospital.

38:42.916 --> 38:44.333
Just keep talking!

38:44.416 --> 38:45.375
Danilo!

38:47.250 --> 38:48.333
Hang tight, Danilo!

38:50.250 --> 38:51.125
Danilo!

38:56.375 --> 38:57.500
No! Fuck!

38:58.666 --> 38:59.708
No!

38:59.791 --> 39:01.125
Danilo, talk to me!

39:03.833 --> 39:04.750
Danilo!

39:24.416 --> 39:26.750
I'm sorry for your loss, pilot.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.750
Bring him here, we'll take care of it.

39:52.041 --> 39:55.083
REST IN PEACE
FROM YOUR MR10 FRIENDS

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Are you hungry?

42:48.833 --> 42:49.916
I don't know, Roger.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.875
You're safe. I've got your back.

42:51.958 --> 42:56.083
I can't do this, I have a daughter.
I'm all Bárbara's got. Can't risk it.

42:56.166 --> 42:57.416
Trust me, man.

42:58.250 --> 42:59.250
Trust me.

43:06.333 --> 43:07.458
How's school going?

43:09.625 --> 43:10.750
I'm on vacation.

43:18.541 --> 43:20.916
Bárbara,
I can't sleep on the couch forever.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.458
Just go and leave me, then.

43:24.541 --> 43:26.208
How would I just leave you, girl?

43:27.541 --> 43:31.583
You're just a kid. You're 14.
You know you can't live alone.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.208
So? What are you gonna do?

43:37.583 --> 43:41.125
The right thing to do
would be to go to social services.

43:42.750 --> 43:45.750
If you do that,
I'll tell them all you and Dad did.

43:46.500 --> 43:49.250
I'm not dumb. I know what you were doing.

43:49.750 --> 43:53.333
Bárbara, keeping you here illegally
is a crime, too.

43:57.166 --> 44:00.166
I could always go live with my grandma.

44:03.875 --> 44:04.791
Grandma?

44:06.541 --> 44:08.125
Yeah. My mom's mom.

44:08.208 --> 44:11.750
She hated my dad's guts.
We lost touch after Mom passed away.

44:11.833 --> 44:15.125
She lived somewhere in the suburbs.
I don't know where she is now.

44:16.416 --> 44:18.958
But this is great news!

44:19.041 --> 44:22.125
We can track down
a family friend or a relative.

44:22.208 --> 44:23.333
Let's find someone.

44:24.250 --> 44:26.083
I'll look her up on Facebook.

44:26.166 --> 44:28.750
It's the one social network
every old person uses.

44:28.833 --> 44:29.708
Great.

44:29.791 --> 44:32.416
But I'm not going to a foster home
until we find her.

44:36.416 --> 44:39.208
Unfortunately, we can't stay here.

44:44.708 --> 44:46.083
Is this where you live?

44:46.166 --> 44:48.458
Yeah. This is not gonna do either.

45:05.458 --> 45:06.750
Make yourself at home.

45:09.208 --> 45:12.958
Do you want to check the fridge?
Watch some TV?

45:14.083 --> 45:15.375
Where's my room?

45:42.750 --> 45:43.583
Roger?

45:46.375 --> 45:48.916
-Oh, congratulations!
-Hey, Toledo.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.666
No one ever doubted your talents.

45:51.750 --> 45:55.708
Except you never had the results
to back it up, the numbers.

45:56.416 --> 45:57.500
Now you do.

45:57.583 --> 46:00.833
I thought you said the problem
was our country's economy and--

46:00.916 --> 46:05.333
Roger, we've won every year
ever since this category was created.

46:05.416 --> 46:07.333
We're not letting that go.

46:07.833 --> 46:09.458
And we want you back.

46:10.458 --> 46:11.708
No hard feelings?

46:12.666 --> 46:14.208
No hard feelings.

46:26.250 --> 46:27.250
Hey, Bárbara!

46:28.041 --> 46:29.250
Wanna play?

46:43.500 --> 46:44.333
INCOMING CALL
SMOKEY

46:47.291 --> 46:49.166
-Wanna pause?
-No.

46:50.333 --> 46:51.541
I'll get that later.

46:53.541 --> 46:55.875
I have a meeting with a new coach.

46:57.750 --> 46:59.041
To replace Dad?

47:02.583 --> 47:04.833
Your dad can't be replaced, Bárbara.

47:06.166 --> 47:08.166
I'll meet him this weekend.

47:08.250 --> 47:09.250
Wanna come along?

47:16.625 --> 47:18.375
You can stay in the pit.

47:19.125 --> 47:20.625
With your dad's headset.

47:23.041 --> 47:24.041
Sure.

47:24.916 --> 47:26.916
Your friend's calling again.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.791
SMOKEY
NEED YOU

47:34.000 --> 47:38.166
It's about to start!
From now on, it's pedal to the metal.

47:38.250 --> 47:39.958
The red light goes off!

47:43.458 --> 47:45.083
How's the grid, new guy?

47:45.583 --> 47:47.458
Débora had a bad start. Don't worry.

47:58.958 --> 48:02.000
On your first two laps,
you matched your qualifying time.

48:04.833 --> 48:07.083
Watch out, the Queen's about to strike.

48:09.875 --> 48:10.791
Step on it!

48:15.583 --> 48:17.916
She's hot on Roger's heels!

48:18.000 --> 48:21.125
The real fight of the season
right on your screen.

48:21.208 --> 48:23.083
What's the telemetry, Gaúcho?

48:23.666 --> 48:25.791
Water's under 120 °C. Step on it.

48:25.875 --> 48:27.666
Are you sure the engine can take it?

48:27.750 --> 48:30.291
It's looking good. Go for it, hit the gas.

48:47.583 --> 48:49.291
The truck feels clunky.

48:49.375 --> 48:51.875
Oil pressure's too high. It won't make it.

48:51.958 --> 48:52.958
What do I do?

48:53.041 --> 48:54.416
Don't push it too much!

48:54.500 --> 48:57.291
Roger, turn the water on.
Truck's overheating, that's why--

48:57.375 --> 48:58.875
Bárbara, don't disturb him!

48:58.958 --> 49:01.500
Don't talk over each other, god dammit!

49:01.583 --> 49:04.041
And wake up, newbie!
Are you sleeping over there?

49:06.375 --> 49:10.625
Let her pass you in the fast section.
Save some juice for the slow section.

49:10.708 --> 49:13.291
Are you crazy?
I'm not letting anybody overtake me!

49:14.750 --> 49:15.791
Let her through.

49:15.875 --> 49:18.666
You'll out-drive her
in the low-speed section.

49:18.750 --> 49:20.458
Are you crazy? No way!

49:20.541 --> 49:23.750
She'll pass you anyway.
May as well cool off your truck.

49:23.833 --> 49:26.000
Straight line,
and the Queen's gonna pounce!

49:27.500 --> 49:28.791
She's pulled alongside him.

49:33.041 --> 49:35.583
Débora takes a good lead!

49:35.666 --> 49:38.791
What a huge mistake.
He'll never reach her now.

49:38.875 --> 49:42.375
That was an easy pass to put her in first.
Roger lags behind.

49:42.458 --> 49:45.083
Roger, now turn the water off
or you'll run dry.

49:46.625 --> 49:48.041
Trust me, Roger.

49:49.958 --> 49:51.541
Time to go get her.

50:10.625 --> 50:13.666
Roger's on his way
and he's giving his all!

50:17.458 --> 50:18.708
You can do it!

50:25.708 --> 50:27.416
Roger retakes the lead!

50:31.333 --> 50:33.166
They're in the final stretch!

50:39.791 --> 50:44.000
Roger Mattos gets the checkered flag!

50:44.083 --> 50:46.083
He takes yet another win.

50:48.125 --> 50:49.958
Celebrate away, Roger Mattos!

50:56.416 --> 50:59.041
We're almost taking the lead, huh?

50:59.541 --> 51:01.875
Thank you, kiddo. She's the best!

51:03.458 --> 51:04.583
You killed it.

51:05.666 --> 51:08.375
Phenomenal, champ! You deserve it!

51:12.833 --> 51:15.541
Wait, who--
Let's make a line here, shall we?

51:18.500 --> 51:20.208
Get your head in the game, newbie.

51:23.458 --> 51:25.333
Where's that motherfucker?

51:25.416 --> 51:27.000
Hell yeah, Roger!

51:27.083 --> 51:29.208
So this is your hideout?

51:29.291 --> 51:31.166
-Come here.
-Hey, Odilon.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.166
You made me come all this way
to congratulate you, you rascal.

51:35.250 --> 51:36.666
Now, uh…

51:37.166 --> 51:39.750
Come here, I need to talk to you.
Excuse me.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.041
Smokey mentioned he's been calling you,
but you won't pick up.

51:45.125 --> 51:46.458
Is that true?

51:47.708 --> 51:50.833
I've been busy. I haven't had the time.

51:50.916 --> 51:53.291
I couldn't… I was busy.

51:54.208 --> 51:57.250
Were you, now?
You've got to be kidding me.

51:57.333 --> 52:01.875
This is serious business, Roger.
Listen to what I'm telling you.

52:02.458 --> 52:05.833
Don't fuck around with Smokey. Okay?

52:05.916 --> 52:08.458
-Okay. I'll see what I can do.
-You do that.

52:10.083 --> 52:12.708
I'll get back to him.
I've been working on some stuff and--

52:12.791 --> 52:15.708
-I trust you, Roger.
-I promise I'll talk to him.

52:15.791 --> 52:19.166
But don't mess up again.
I can only cover your ass so much.

52:20.833 --> 52:21.708
Jordan.

52:29.083 --> 52:31.541
She looks way too young
to be your grandma.

52:32.333 --> 52:35.291
-Check out the one below.
-She doesn't even look like me.

52:38.625 --> 52:41.625
Well, I'll hit the shower
before the pizza gets here.

52:41.708 --> 52:43.625
-Call me if you need anything.
-Fine.

52:43.708 --> 52:44.791
Bárbara…

52:44.875 --> 52:46.833
We need to find your grandma soon.

52:46.916 --> 52:49.708
I'm on it. I'll keep combing
through Facebook to find her.

52:50.333 --> 52:52.708
-This is very important!
-Okay.

52:52.791 --> 52:53.750
Be right back.

53:04.458 --> 53:06.000
Pizza's here!

53:08.291 --> 53:10.500
Yo. What's up? Is Roger home?

53:10.583 --> 53:12.041
Yeah. Roger?

53:17.541 --> 53:19.666
Why did you stop
picking up the damn phone?

53:19.750 --> 53:22.333
-Bárbara, go to your room.
-You ain't sharing a room?

53:22.416 --> 53:23.750
Show her some respect!

53:23.833 --> 53:26.041
C'mon, try me and see what happens.

53:26.833 --> 53:28.791
So brave with a gun in your hand.

53:29.583 --> 53:30.666
Drop that shit, Sketch.

53:30.750 --> 53:33.791
I ain't here to make a fuss, Baby Driver.

53:33.875 --> 53:36.416
I'm here to make sure
you meet your end of the deal.

53:37.041 --> 53:38.291
I'll talk to Smokey.

53:38.833 --> 53:41.625
I know you will.
I'm here to make sure of it.

53:55.208 --> 54:00.291
That's right. License plate DQH-7654,
from Rio de Janeiro.

54:00.375 --> 54:01.750
Do a full search.

54:02.625 --> 54:04.750
Yeah, I'll stay on his trail.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.000
What's good, homie?

54:10.791 --> 54:12.500
You cool? How's the hood?

54:12.583 --> 54:14.333
-It's clear.
-All good?

54:14.916 --> 54:15.958
Damn straight, fam.

54:18.166 --> 54:19.500
'Sup.

54:20.000 --> 54:20.916
Peace.

54:30.583 --> 54:31.583
Here's your man, boss.

54:32.666 --> 54:34.375
Hello there, pilot.

54:36.208 --> 54:38.916
So, Roger,
you really let it go to your head, huh?

54:40.166 --> 54:41.750
I had a lot on my mind lately.

54:41.833 --> 54:45.000
Roger, I watch all your races.

54:45.500 --> 54:49.000
I really root for you.
I'm a true supporter and all.

54:50.166 --> 54:51.166
But c'mon.

54:51.833 --> 54:55.833
It's kinda fucked up of you
to leave us hanging when a job comes.

54:55.916 --> 54:58.125
I wasn't aware there'd been a job, Smokey.

54:58.208 --> 55:00.541
Fuck, bro, we called you nonstop.

55:00.625 --> 55:02.458
You don't pick up your phone.

55:02.541 --> 55:06.083
I mean, fuck.
Your phone won't pick itself up.

55:06.583 --> 55:08.875
It came up out of nowhere.

55:08.958 --> 55:12.083
It was a nice job, you know? Easy-peasy.

55:12.166 --> 55:14.708
A fucking awesome job,
but we missed our chance.

55:14.791 --> 55:17.916
I have nothing to do with that.
I'm just the driver, remember?

55:18.000 --> 55:20.791
Except that I paid for the intel
and it went to waste.

55:20.875 --> 55:23.750
-It was money down the drain.
-I want out, man.

55:27.375 --> 55:28.791
I'm not cut out for this.

55:29.875 --> 55:31.541
I don't want to end up like Danilo.

55:31.625 --> 55:32.625
Fuck…

55:33.208 --> 55:34.625
I've got sponsors again.

55:35.750 --> 55:36.791
What's that, bro?

55:37.541 --> 55:39.291
My sponsors are back.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.416
And what's this?

55:43.125 --> 55:45.000
Why the long face, my man?

55:45.083 --> 55:48.875
Now that you have sponsors
you don't need us anymore, huh?

55:48.958 --> 55:50.541
You're all set, you're rich!

55:50.625 --> 55:52.708
Don't forget your friends, homie.

55:52.791 --> 55:55.708
All right, Mr. Roger. Go on, then.

55:58.500 --> 56:03.500
But hey, Smokey never forgets,
you hear me?

56:13.458 --> 56:14.583
Is everything okay?

56:16.291 --> 56:18.208
I knew you were doing shady shit!

56:18.291 --> 56:21.500
The shop was already in too deep
when I inherited it.

56:21.583 --> 56:22.500
Oh really, Roger?

56:22.583 --> 56:25.333
That was the only chance I had
to get back on my feet.

56:26.125 --> 56:27.958
To get money for the team.

56:28.041 --> 56:30.916
Do you have any idea
how fucking risky that was?

56:31.000 --> 56:32.041
Of course.

56:33.833 --> 56:36.500
Of course I do. But it's over now, Débora.

56:38.333 --> 56:39.541
I'll focus on Bárbara now.

56:39.625 --> 56:41.250
Oh God, there's Bárbara…

56:46.333 --> 56:47.166
Roger…

56:49.000 --> 56:50.250
What are you going to do?

56:52.541 --> 56:54.333
Are you sticking around for her?

56:54.416 --> 56:56.750
I don't have the stability
to care for her.

56:57.250 --> 56:59.125
But we're looking for her grandma.

56:59.958 --> 57:02.208
Where has she been all along?

57:03.291 --> 57:04.166
Well…

57:05.291 --> 57:08.166
That's what I'm doing.
I'm trying to track her family down.

57:08.791 --> 57:10.333
It's all I'm gonna do from now on.

57:14.083 --> 57:15.333
I'm trying to change.

57:21.791 --> 57:22.708
Fine.

57:38.375 --> 57:39.583
And your grandma?

57:41.416 --> 57:43.750
I just found a cousin here.

57:44.625 --> 57:45.833
A cousin?

57:45.916 --> 57:47.583
A cousin of sorts.

57:48.083 --> 57:49.458
A potential cousin.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.791
He has grandma's last name.

57:52.375 --> 57:53.750
But his profile is private,

57:53.833 --> 57:56.166
so I sent him a friend request and a DM.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.750
Bárbara, it's past your bedtime.

58:00.833 --> 58:02.416
-Off you go.
-Okay.

58:04.500 --> 58:05.583
Good night.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.125
Night.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.166
DUPLICATE CERTIFICATE
BIRTH - MARRIAGE - DEATH

REGISTRY OFFICES AROUND ME

58:48.250 --> 58:50.333
TRUCK RACING DRIVERS

58:50.833 --> 58:52.458
WHAT A TRAGEDY

58:52.541 --> 58:54.166
UNBELIEVABLE

59:05.541 --> 59:08.541
SMOKEY

59:16.291 --> 59:17.250
Hello?

59:17.333 --> 59:19.708
-Hey there, pilot!
-Did you fucking kill Toledo?

59:19.791 --> 59:23.041
Rio is a dangerous place.
Gotta be careful.

59:23.125 --> 59:26.166
Now, listen.
Sketch is on his way, be ready.

59:26.250 --> 59:28.375
It's an easy gig in Três Rios.

59:28.916 --> 59:30.791
We'll be back in no time. Deal?

59:30.875 --> 59:31.916
I knew it!

59:35.458 --> 59:38.125
I'll assemble the team.
Let me know if anything comes up.

59:39.125 --> 59:40.250
Let's do this.

59:41.875 --> 59:43.916
It's an easy gig in Três Rios.

59:50.625 --> 59:54.583
-It's that one, all right?
-I'll go after it like a hungry pit bull.

01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:16.125
Get out of there right now!
Hurry the fuck up!

01:00:16.208 --> 01:00:18.250
Don't look at me. Move!

01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.833
-We gotta go now!
-All right.

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:21.666
-Let's take this.
-What about this one?

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:23.875
The boys will drive it. Hey, c'mon!

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:26.666
No need to switch cabs.
I'll go with Roger.

01:00:29.166 --> 01:00:30.125
Let's go!

01:00:43.958 --> 01:00:45.791
We were supposed to switch cabs.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:48.083
Chill. I blocked the signal, we're good.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:49.708
It's how Danilo used to do it.

01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:52.500
Danilo ain't here.
Stop being a wuss and drive.

01:00:53.708 --> 01:00:55.166
'Sup, boss? Tell us.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.208
We're fucked. Beat it!
The cops are after you.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:00:59.125
What?

01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:01.791
The pigs, pilot. They're right behind you.

01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:04.250
-You gotta disappear.
-Disappear where?

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:06.333
Ditch this fucking cargo.

01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:07.875
Ditch it where, Sketch?

01:01:07.958 --> 01:01:09.208
Gun it, come on!

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:10.916
-Take the next right!
-Hold on!

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.541
We're next to the Morro da Cotia.
Let's lay low there with my homies.

01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:23.875
-Where the fuck is it?
-We're almost there!

01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:26.125
Just floor it or we're done, man!

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:33.583
Yo, the pigs are coming.

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:35.583
-Let them through.
-Smoke them.

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:38.791
That's my boy Smokey's turf!

01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:41.291
Good morning, fam!

01:01:45.625 --> 01:01:48.500
Those thugs took the cargo
deep in the hood.

01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:51.166
Do we hold them, boss?

01:01:55.541 --> 01:01:56.625
C'mon, c'mon!

01:01:58.125 --> 01:01:59.291
Go, go, go!

01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:01.500
We've got some action.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.583
Look out!

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Go, go, go!

01:02:13.708 --> 01:02:14.666
Fuck!

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.333
Up there!

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.291
Motherfucker!

01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:22.541
Shit!

01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:28.125
Fuck! Hey!

01:02:28.833 --> 01:02:30.291
Place is too hot! Fall back!

01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:31.791
Let's go!

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:33.541
Get the hell out of here!

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500
Go!

01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:41.916
Hurry! Help us out!

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.083
C'mon, y'all! Help us!

01:02:44.166 --> 01:02:46.166
C'mon! Help me out, bro.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:50.791
A little gift from Smokey
to the neighborhood! Yo.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.833
Sketch! You think the cops won't come?

01:02:53.916 --> 01:02:57.083
You think they'll roll through the hood
over a bunch of tablets?

01:02:57.166 --> 01:02:58.916
No fucking way! Here, pick it up.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.708
I wonder who the fuck called them up.

01:03:01.666 --> 01:03:05.333
Bro, you saw me use the jammer
just like you told me to.

01:03:05.416 --> 01:03:07.250
Someone must've tipped them off.

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:10.000
Hey! No fighting, homies!
Wait, I'll hand it over.

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:13.916
There you go! Why fight?
There's enough for everyone!

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.958
Did the goods have a tracker?

01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:21.166
No way, man.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:22.833
Why didn't you switch cabs?

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:24.250
Huh?

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.875
What, have you gone soft now, Sketch?

01:03:26.958 --> 01:03:30.500
-Too lazy to do your job?
-Yo, boss. We don't even know if--

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:31.958
Shit, there's no need to--

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.666
Don't you mess with me either,
you motherfucker.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:36.958
You ain't no fucking rat, are you?

01:03:39.166 --> 01:03:40.541
You calling me a rat?

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.458
-You still owe me.
-But that was my last job.

01:03:44.541 --> 01:03:46.666
-I got nothing from it!
-I'm fucking out.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:49.041
-Like hell you are!
-I'm done with this shit.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:52.208
If you wanna kill me, do it.
I've got nothing to lose.

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:53.875
And that's all on you!

01:03:54.916 --> 01:03:56.416
Because you're a brat.

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.583
You're being one right now.

01:03:58.666 --> 01:03:59.833
Fuck this, I'm out.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:02.208
No. Let him go.

01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:04.041
Let him go. There he goes!

01:04:04.625 --> 01:04:05.500
Fine.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:08.083
Leaving me high and dry, huh?

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:09.166
Fucking fine.

01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:15.875
-Should we do him in, boss?
-Not yet.

01:04:15.958 --> 01:04:17.500
Bitch-ass clown.

01:04:32.958 --> 01:04:35.791
-Fox, check the suspension.
-You got it.

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:38.041
-The back's pulling too much.
-I'll take a look.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:39.500
I'll leave it in your hands.

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.458
Let's do it, boys.

01:04:41.958 --> 01:04:42.875
What's up, Afonso?

01:04:43.708 --> 01:04:46.791
-Cheering me on during practice?
-Amazing practice, man.

01:04:46.875 --> 01:04:49.708
-Thanks.
-Can we talk for a bit?

01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:51.875
Not right now, man. Maybe after--

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.666
I'm afraid right now will have to do.

01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:03.250
-I swear I have nothing to do with it.
-I have it all on tape.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.208
If I wanted to arrest you, I could.

01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:08.291
-But I don't want to.
-What do you want, then?

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:10.750
I want everyone.

01:05:11.416 --> 01:05:15.458
Gotta catch Smokey and Odilon in the act
so that no slimy lawyer can bail them out.

01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:16.583
Fuck, Afonso.

01:05:17.166 --> 01:05:19.333
I can't do that.
I've got too much to lose.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:22.083
What if I took you in right now?
Think about it, Roger.

01:05:22.166 --> 01:05:25.958
I like you, I know you're a little fish,
but you gotta help me help you.

01:05:45.416 --> 01:05:47.166
Bárbara, we need to talk.

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:50.458
-In a minute.
-Not in a minute. Right now.

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:52.458
What's wrong?

01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:57.541
I just got back from the registry office.

01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:01.625
I know you're lying, Bárbara.

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:06.000
-Both your grandmothers are dead.
-They are.

01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:09.083
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.458
'Cause I have no one!

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.083
Everyone in my life is dead.

01:06:17.416 --> 01:06:18.416
Bárbara…

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:21.916
I can't keep you here. That's illegal.

01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:25.500
Well, so is stealing trucks.

01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:47.083
Bárbara.

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:54.125
Bárbara?

01:07:01.666 --> 01:07:02.625
Bárbara!

01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:08.541
Bárbara!

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:15.625
STILL THINK YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE?

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:16.750
Fuck.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.916
Roger! Help! They're keeping me in a--

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.541
You listening, Roger?
If you don't do as you're told,

01:07:31.625 --> 01:07:35.083
this will be the last time
you'll ever hear her voice, all right?

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:50.416
Out of the car! Game over.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.041
-Calm down.
-It's over.

01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:54.000
-Move!
-Calm down.

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:01.833
Hey, man.
You're the one in charge in the field.

01:08:01.916 --> 01:08:03.833
-I'm the boss, but you--
-Smoke!

01:08:04.791 --> 01:08:06.375
Where's the girl, damn it?

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:07.500
What's this?

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.416
-Where is she?
-Hold up!

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.708
It's my pilot. Calm down!

01:08:12.208 --> 01:08:15.125
What the fuck?
Is this how you treat your investors?

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:17.500
Take a chill pill, bro.

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:21.041
You don't just
fucking walk in here like that.

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:23.250
I'll hand the girl over to you, sure.

01:08:23.333 --> 01:08:26.125
If you do one last job for me.

01:08:27.125 --> 01:08:29.791
-Didn't you say that last time?
-But that one went to shit.

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:32.916
This one's gonna work.
We'll make tons of cash.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.875
I'll even pay you extra.

01:08:34.958 --> 01:08:37.166
-I want to talk to Bárbara.
-After the job, sure.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:39.541
-No, I gotta know that she's okay.
-Come on, man!

01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:43.250
Don't you get what's going on?
What do you take me for?

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:44.625
Are you crazy?

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.166
First we negotiate,
then you talk to the girl.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.333
What's the deal?

01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:54.125
You bring me the cargo,
I bring you the girl. That's it.

01:08:57.916 --> 01:08:59.416
What's their truck model?

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.791
Container semi-truck.

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:02.750
There'll be a security escort.

01:09:03.833 --> 01:09:06.083
-Private company?
-The pigs.

01:09:06.666 --> 01:09:08.416
The state's own security "company".

01:09:09.958 --> 01:09:10.916
What the fuck, Smoke?

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:13.708
You're robbing the police now?

01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:15.583
Well, they rob us every day.

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:17.458
What are we stealing?

01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:20.041
-What do you care? You never asked.
-I'm asking now.

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:21.333
Fine, then. Weapons!

01:09:22.166 --> 01:09:24.083
Weapons! Okay?

01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:28.541
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Stealing guns from the police?

01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:30.208
Oh, for fuck's sake!

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.333
Do your criminal mastermind shit.

01:09:32.416 --> 01:09:35.250
Make this run
and bring this truck back to me.

01:09:35.333 --> 01:09:39.125
-No fucking way I'm doing that!
-God dammit! This crap again?

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.791
-Fuck!
-I wanna talk to Odilon.

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:42.458
I'll get him right now.

01:09:42.958 --> 01:09:43.833
Odilon.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.708
Will you come here, Odilon?

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:48.333
The boy wants to talk to you.

01:09:48.833 --> 01:09:51.250
Roger. My boy Roger.

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:53.333
What are you doing here, Odilon?

01:09:53.416 --> 01:09:56.583
Making sure you don't shit on my business.

01:09:56.666 --> 01:10:00.958
I climbed all the fucking way up here
to personally talk you into this.

01:10:01.041 --> 01:10:03.000
-Into stealing weapons?
-Weapons?

01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:04.833
No, not weapons.

01:10:04.916 --> 01:10:06.541
A fucking arsenal!

01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:09.916
All in working order and unregistered.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.541
We're talking 60 or 80 grand per rifle.

01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:17.916
It's more money
than you've ever made with a sponsor.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.416
You bring that in and we let the girl go.

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:25.291
What's the plan?

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:27.500
They'll pass through São Paulo.

01:10:27.583 --> 01:10:29.708
Yes, early Sunday morning.

01:10:29.791 --> 01:10:30.625
Odilon…

01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:33.250
-What?
-It's the day of the last race.

01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:36.500
That's in Interlagos!
You know it like the back of your hand!

01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:38.541
That's why we need you.

01:10:39.041 --> 01:10:42.166
And we'll keep the girl
so you don't forget that.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:45.208
Do this right, and everyone will be happy.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:51.000
So honor your father
and don't screw up again, all right?

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:49.625
Hello?

01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:53.458
It's time. What's it gonna be?

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.458
I'll need a cab just like theirs.

01:11:56.958 --> 01:11:58.583
And also a mason,

01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:01.166
a van, and two armored cars.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.583
What are you measuring?

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.833
Stop asking me questions
like we're buddies.

01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:07.000
Oh, and phones with working SIM cards.

01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:10.375
We ain't gonna read your messages
or delete your photos.

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:11.666
What's up, Vampire?

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:15.250
If this crusty-ass phone doesn't work,
we're gonna come for you.

01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:16.916
What do you take us for?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.666
Don't try to pull a fast one on us.
Here, give me that.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:23.458
We've given you all you've asked for.
Do not disappoint me.

01:12:23.541 --> 01:12:25.166
If you lay a finger on Bárbara--

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.958
If you want a happy ending, earn it.

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:30.125
They're on the move.

01:12:30.208 --> 01:12:31.958
FEDERAL POLICE

01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:32.875
Sounds good.

01:12:46.916 --> 01:12:49.833
-All good?
-Yeah. I've got them all on radio.

01:12:49.916 --> 01:12:51.041
Time for the van.

01:12:51.125 --> 01:12:53.916
On it. Yo, GG, do you copy?

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:56.416
GG here, Sketch. Copy.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.416
Send the van in, my brother.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.416
Affirmative. On its way.

01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:13.541
HEAVY TRAFFIC ALERT

01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:14.750
Holy shit!

01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:17.583
Now people will avoid this route
thinking it's jammed.

01:13:17.666 --> 01:13:18.916
That's some nerd-ass shit!

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.583
Don't forget to share our location
with Smokey.

01:13:22.458 --> 01:13:23.583
I'm on it.

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.458
What now, Roger?

01:13:25.541 --> 01:13:27.041
Now shit gets real.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:31.708
Nice!

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.500
Fuck yeah, bro!

01:14:58.083 --> 01:14:59.916
-How does it look, Sketch?
-Wait.

01:15:01.708 --> 01:15:03.375
Wait, it's coming now.

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:04.458
Three…

01:15:06.291 --> 01:15:07.208
Two…

01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:08.791
One…

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:10.583
Now!

01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:12.416
Fuck yeah!

01:15:36.458 --> 01:15:37.583
Fuck yeah!

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:40.666
Holy shit!

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:43.125
What's there to celebrate?
Go uncouple the container.

01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:44.625
Shit. Say no more.

01:16:03.375 --> 01:16:04.416
Hurry up, Sketch!

01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:07.166
Uncouple this fucking thing!

01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:11.750
Sketch!

01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:23.125
Step on it, fucker!

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:25.375
-Let's fucking go!
-Go faster!

01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:28.041
-This isn't a Ferrari, man.
-They're on our tail!

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:30.250
-We stick to the plan!
-Go faster, damn it!

01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:33.041
Shut the fuck up! I know what I'm doing!

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:34.583
I ain't doing time!

01:16:38.666 --> 01:16:41.333
If your homies did their job right,
we'll get through.

01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:45.833
How the fuck are we getting through that?

01:16:46.916 --> 01:16:48.833
We're gonna crash, Roger!

01:16:48.916 --> 01:16:50.625
Jesus Christ! Fuck!

01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:55.708
Fuck yeah!

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:05.666
Time to switch cabs.

01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:12.291
Come on, pull over here.

01:17:24.375 --> 01:17:25.958
Tell me where we're headed.

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:28.583
Don't worry, just keep going.
You'll learn soon enough.

01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:30.083
What, you don't trust me?

01:17:30.166 --> 01:17:32.125
Don't start. We're almost there.

01:17:32.208 --> 01:17:33.500
Go through that tunnel.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.833
Go straight ahead.

01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:32.791
They're here. There.

01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:37.500
Well done, pilot!

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:39.791
Right on!

01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:04.833
Come here!

01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:11.666
Get down nice and easy.
Don't try anything stupid.

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:16.500
Let's get the grill going for tonight.

01:19:18.583 --> 01:19:21.083
Well, you've made it.

01:19:22.208 --> 01:19:23.875
-As promised.
-Yeah.

01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:28.333
Now you let the girl go.

01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:31.333
You're pretty obsessed
with this girl, huh? Shit.

01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:35.166
Right now?
Aren't you gonna go pick her up?

01:19:35.666 --> 01:19:36.500
Now.

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:40.000
A friend of mine will pick her up.

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:41.708
"A friend."

01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:53.791
She's free to go.

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:01.958
-Hi.
-Débora.

01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:04.000
They say she's free to go.

01:20:04.083 --> 01:20:05.583
I see her. She's here.

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:08.000
Bárbara!

01:20:18.041 --> 01:20:19.500
I'm a man of my word.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.208
Congratulations.

01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:24.333
What the hell, man?

01:20:24.416 --> 01:20:26.333
Ungrateful little fuck.

01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:28.500
Get the hell out of my sight.

01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:31.541
Scram! Get your ass out of here.

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:34.291
Hell yeah!

01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:41.541
-What the hell?
-What's this about, boss?

01:20:42.041 --> 01:20:43.208
What the fuck?

01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:44.875
Roger, you son of a bitch!

01:20:44.958 --> 01:20:47.375
Fuck, he's running away! Stop, Roger!

01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:49.125
Fucking stop!

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:53.875
-Fucking asshole!
-Stop right there!

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.416
Stop!

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.708
Stop! Fucking hell!

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:11.291
-Did they hurt you?
-No.

01:21:11.375 --> 01:21:13.333
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:16.750
-Stop right there!
-Easy.

01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:18.375
Fuck that! Hand me the girl!

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.458
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

01:21:30.708 --> 01:21:32.333
CALLING ODILON

01:21:32.416 --> 01:21:33.958
Roger! You okay?

01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:37.708
Odilon! Have you heard from Smokey?
Tried to get a hold of him?

01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:38.833
Smokey?

01:21:38.916 --> 01:21:41.416
Don't pick up if they call you!

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.583
Things went south. The cops arrived.
But I got away with the cargo.

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:47.583
Listen, I'm getting away.
I'll fill you in later.

01:21:47.666 --> 01:21:49.375
Wait. If you don't call--

01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:52.916
He fucking hung up.

01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:56.166
This is the location.
Sketch, got a hold of Odilon?

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:58.375
Nothing yet. I'm on my way there.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.875
That's our cargo there. Right there.

01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:11.666
-'Sup, boss.
-Hey, Spunk.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.458
-What now?
-I want you to bring him to me.

01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:18.208
I want him on his knees.

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:19.708
-You got it.
-Now.

01:23:19.791 --> 01:23:22.291
You go ahead. You take point.

01:23:25.208 --> 01:23:26.208
Be careful.

01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:40.125
Look!

01:23:40.208 --> 01:23:41.500
It's his phone!

01:23:45.291 --> 01:23:47.958
-He's not picking up.
-Did something go wrong?

01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:49.083
It can't be.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.791
UNKNOWN CALLER

01:23:53.875 --> 01:23:55.166
Hello?

01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:56.375
Hey, it's me.

01:23:57.458 --> 01:24:00.333
Roger, are you okay? Where are you?

01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:05.541
I'm on your six.

01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:09.416
Right behind you.

01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:12.166
But not for long.

01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:19.375
Thanks, Josué.

01:24:22.916 --> 01:24:25.333
The whole pack
barrels down the front straightaway.

01:24:25.416 --> 01:24:28.083
The Queen and Roger
are dueling it out in the front row.

01:24:28.916 --> 01:24:31.916
The Queen leads the championship,
with Roger in second,

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.458
a mere three points behind.

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:38.708
If he wins,
he clinches the title on his own terms.

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:47.333
The Queen is pulling ahead,
cementing herself in first place.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.208
They are neck-in-neck in the Senna S,

01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:52.583
as Roger keeps looking for a breach.

01:24:59.958 --> 01:25:01.791
Easy, Roger. Try an inside pass.

01:25:01.875 --> 01:25:03.625
Not outside, inside!

01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:04.958
She's gonna brake!

01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:07.625
Roger's making a move on the outside.

01:25:07.708 --> 01:25:10.125
The Queen sticks to the inside,
takes the racing line.

01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:12.750
-He'll have to brake hard!
-Fuck!

01:25:14.083 --> 01:25:15.875
Oh no, Roger! Not like that!

01:25:15.958 --> 01:25:17.125
Shit!

01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:19.083
Roger skids off the track.

01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:23.958
Fuck!

01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:25.708
Relax, boss.

01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:29.250
As soon as the truck is here,
we'll tow the container.

01:25:30.541 --> 01:25:34.041
"Relax" my ass.
We have to move this shit stat.

01:25:38.041 --> 01:25:40.833
Something feels off.

01:25:45.291 --> 01:25:47.500
-Freeze, motherfuckers!
-Fuck!

01:25:55.958 --> 01:25:58.833
-It's over, Bárbara!
-Go, Roger! There's still time.

01:25:59.666 --> 01:26:02.416
-The front pack has already pulled away.
-Stop moaning.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.041
I bet you can make up for it
in under ten laps.

01:26:09.916 --> 01:26:11.250
Let's fucking go.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:12.583
Let's go!

01:26:12.666 --> 01:26:16.666
Given Roger's current situation,
he'll have to go full throttle.

01:26:17.291 --> 01:26:19.416
He'll have to gain numerous positions,

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:23.875
or pray that the title contenders
face mechanical problems.

01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:31.416
We got fucking set up! Motherfuckers!

01:26:32.916 --> 01:26:34.291
Fall back!

01:26:34.875 --> 01:26:35.833
Shit.

01:26:37.708 --> 01:26:38.625
Nice, Roger.

01:26:38.708 --> 01:26:40.250
Pass him in the middle section.

01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:50.833
Roger passes on the outside.
He's moved up.

01:26:50.916 --> 01:26:53.250
He's closing in on the top ten.

01:27:02.875 --> 01:27:03.958
Fuck!

01:27:05.791 --> 01:27:08.375
-How's Roger doing?
-He's in 11th place.

01:27:08.458 --> 01:27:10.625
He keeps going up…

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:12.916
Ninth place now! Fastest lap time today.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.583
Roger moves up again
as he storms into the final straight!

01:27:21.666 --> 01:27:23.291
He's in sixth place now.

01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:32.166
Remarkable comeback drive by Roger.

01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:34.125
Second place! She's the only one left.

01:27:36.083 --> 01:27:40.000
Once again,
he sets the fastest lap time in the race.

01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:41.958
Surrender!

01:27:43.208 --> 01:27:44.125
We're surrounded.

01:27:44.208 --> 01:27:46.333
It's gonna be a fierce battle for the win.

01:27:46.416 --> 01:27:50.666
What an outstanding performance by Roger!

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:52.083
It's game over!

01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:56.500
You're reaching her!
Keep it up, you're really close!

01:27:58.791 --> 01:27:59.833
We give up!

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:02.041
We give up!

01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:03.875
Drop it!

01:28:04.666 --> 01:28:05.833
All right!

01:28:05.916 --> 01:28:08.250
Look! We're done!

01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:10.875
Get the fuck down!

01:28:14.458 --> 01:28:15.875
I surrender, look.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.541
We're done.

01:28:19.458 --> 01:28:21.375
Roger's hot on your tail!

01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:27.666
Roger's back to fight for first place.

01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:29.916
The Queen's standing her ground.

01:28:37.875 --> 01:28:40.166
They're neck-and-neck
as they enter the final lap!

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:41.458
What a thrill!

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:48.375
Roger, on the last turn,
you gotta brake ahead of time.

01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:49.958
Wait, what?

01:28:50.041 --> 01:28:52.791
Slam those brakes early
and power through the apex

01:28:52.875 --> 01:28:53.958
for a quick exit.

01:28:54.041 --> 01:28:55.875
Bárbara, this is no time to take risks!

01:28:55.958 --> 01:28:57.458
No, it's time to listen.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.541
One, two, three…

01:29:04.625 --> 01:29:05.625
Brake!

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:07.708
Wait…

01:29:09.291 --> 01:29:10.416
Now!

01:29:15.958 --> 01:29:19.125
Roger needs to make the pass
to become the champion!

01:29:19.708 --> 01:29:23.166
He's navigating an unorthodox racing line.

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:26.250
Roger's takes his chances on the outside.

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.625
It's the final stretch of the race!

01:29:32.708 --> 01:29:35.541
What an amazing end to this season!

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.708
Here they come for the checkered flag!

01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:46.416
It's crunch time! Here comes Roger,
and here comes the Queen. Who'll win?

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.541
The checkered flag waves!

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:58.750
Magnificently done by Roger Mattos!

01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:02.166
-He's the new BR Truck champion!
-Fuck yeah!

01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:03.625
Call your carpenter…

01:30:03.708 --> 01:30:04.916
Hell yeah, kiddo!

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.166
…and have him build you a bigger shelf,
'cause the title is yours, Roger Mattos!

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:11.583
-The BR Truck trophy…
-Good job, Bárbara.

01:30:11.666 --> 01:30:14.750
-…belongs to you.
-Champion!

01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:22.166
I told you!

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.708
I told y'all!

01:30:24.791 --> 01:30:27.750
Didn't I tell you, Fox? I told you, man!

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.083
Thank you!

01:30:32.666 --> 01:30:34.000
All thanks to this girl!

01:30:36.083 --> 01:30:38.083
Thank you so much, sweetheart.

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:40.791
Yeah, I guess you did good.

01:30:40.875 --> 01:30:41.916
-I did?
-You did.

01:30:42.875 --> 01:30:43.958
You're the bee's knees.

01:30:45.041 --> 01:30:46.208
Congratulations.

01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:47.541
Thank you, everyone!

01:30:49.958 --> 01:30:52.333
-We're kicking ass.
-Roger!

01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:55.375
-Fuck!
-Bárbara, stay right here.

01:30:56.958 --> 01:30:59.958
What the fuck is going on, god dammit?

01:31:01.375 --> 01:31:02.625
It's over, Odilon.

01:31:02.708 --> 01:31:05.750
-What's over? Your race? What the fuck?
-The jig is up, man.

01:31:05.833 --> 01:31:07.958
-What--
-Afternoon, gentlemen.

01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:10.166
-Excuse me.
-Holy shit.

01:31:11.541 --> 01:31:14.625
-No party today. You're under arrest.
-What?

01:31:14.708 --> 01:31:17.208
Conspiracy and possession of stolen goods.

01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:18.708
What evidence do you have?

01:31:18.791 --> 01:31:21.416
A witness account
that confirms your involvement.

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:25.583
What? Wait!
Do you know who you're talking to?

01:31:25.666 --> 01:31:28.375
-I'm a friend of the Governor!
-Call him, then.

01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:31.041
-Jordan, call my lawyer Freitas!
-I've got my eye on you.

01:31:31.125 --> 01:31:34.541
-Jordan, call Freitas now!
-Take him in, c'mon.

01:31:34.625 --> 01:31:37.000
Don't fucking touch me!

01:31:40.208 --> 01:31:41.666
What about you, huh?

01:31:47.333 --> 01:31:49.666
Don't make me handcuff you.
You coming peacefully?

01:31:54.333 --> 01:31:55.166
Let's go.

01:32:00.791 --> 01:32:01.708
Roger!

01:32:02.875 --> 01:32:04.416
You have two minutes, man.

01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:06.958
Are they really taking you in?

01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:09.625
Yeah, Bárbara.

01:32:11.041 --> 01:32:12.958
I have to pay for my mistakes.

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:18.000
But hey, once I do my time…

01:32:20.333 --> 01:32:22.541
I'll start over the right way.

01:32:25.333 --> 01:32:26.333
I'm sorry.

01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:29.583
For everything.

01:32:32.083 --> 01:32:33.208
Be safe, kiddo.

01:32:33.875 --> 01:32:34.833
Let's go.

01:32:36.291 --> 01:32:37.500
He did the right thing.

01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:35.125
TWO YEARS LATER

01:33:38.083 --> 01:33:40.500
WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH,
THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP

01:34:19.666 --> 01:34:20.666
Let's go.

01:34:22.666 --> 01:34:23.791
Sure.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.416
Thank you.

01:34:28.708 --> 01:34:29.625
Bárbara?

01:34:33.916 --> 01:34:35.958
I've missed you, kiddo.

01:34:36.458 --> 01:34:37.500
Oh, sweetheart.

01:34:38.208 --> 01:34:39.833
-You okay?
-Thought I'd come alone?

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.083
You did it?

01:34:43.833 --> 01:34:44.666
I did.

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:47.000
And now it's official.

01:34:47.083 --> 01:34:48.916
I have sole custody of her.

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:53.875
And don't you dare mess around again.
You won't get arrested a second time.

01:34:54.708 --> 01:34:57.041
'Cause I'll kill you first. Understand?

01:34:58.083 --> 01:34:59.000
Yeah.

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.708
-Hand me the keys, I wanna drive.
-Over my dead body!

01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:09.125
Get in the passenger seat.

01:35:09.208 --> 01:35:11.583
I only race with you
'cause we're in separate trucks.

01:35:11.666 --> 01:35:14.625
Did you forget, by any chance,
that I won our last race?

01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:15.875
You did, didn't you?

01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:19.583
You won with stolen money.
How about doing it fair and square?

01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:21.416
Now get in.
