for another 15 minutes.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.666
Otherwise, I'm gonna be late
to meet Cassie's parents.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.583
Hm. First impressions are overrated.

10:35.666 --> 10:37.291
You're divorced, right?

10:38.083 --> 10:39.208
Separated.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.291
[adventurous music playing]

10:42.500 --> 10:44.625
No, the business
has to be registered today.

10:44.708 --> 10:48.541
No, no, no. An indemnity is standard.
They don't add it. We don't sign.

10:48.625 --> 10:51.250
I don't care if he has to go in person.
That's why they hired us.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.666
You're aware I charge
in six-minute increments, right?

10:53.750 --> 10:57.208
I'd remind them that every day they don't
pay is another day they have to pay me.

10:57.291 --> 10:59.916
Oh, we can keep going back and forth
like this for an hour,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.666
or we could just jump to the part
where you agree with me

11:02.750 --> 11:04.500
and you're $300 to the good.

11:05.250 --> 11:09.625
[Logan] So, remind me again.
Your brothers' names are Callum and…

11:09.708 --> 11:10.833
- Cam.
- [Logan] Cam.

11:11.416 --> 11:12.375
[Cassie] Mm-hmm.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.208
Cassie, Callum, Cam.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.083
And the dog's name is Cookie.

11:20.291 --> 11:21.458
It's Veronica.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.666
No, I know. I know it's Veronica, but…

11:27.041 --> 11:30.166
Cookie? Cassie, Callum…
I mean, all the C's?

11:30.250 --> 11:31.375
Try harder.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.625
[phone keypad clicking]

11:32.708 --> 11:33.625
[phone swooshes]

11:35.166 --> 11:36.000
Hey.

11:44.666 --> 11:45.875
Okay, I'll be quick.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.250
I should probably come in,
don't you think?

11:48.333 --> 11:51.166
No, sweetie. I love you,
but we don't have time for you and my dad

11:51.250 --> 11:54.333
to get in another 30-minute conversation
about the origin of the refrigerator.

11:54.416 --> 11:57.291
Sure, sure. You know
it used to be called an icebox?

11:57.375 --> 11:58.750
- Right. Okay.
- That's crazy.

11:58.833 --> 12:02.708
It was just a box with ice.
Think about that. That's crazy. Right?

12:09.791 --> 12:10.916
[engine switching off]

12:11.000 --> 12:12.708

[phone swooshes]

12:17.125 --> 12:18.625
Hey, would you maybe wanna…

12:19.666 --> 12:20.583
come in?

12:20.666 --> 12:21.500
I'm good.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.333
All right.

12:23.416 --> 12:24.375
Be right back.

12:25.458 --> 12:26.333

12:26.416 --> 12:28.458
[birds chirping]

12:28.541 --> 12:31.333
[rock music playing on radio]

12:31.416 --> 12:34.583
Dad! I'm here, and I'm late.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.625
- Hey, kiddo.
- Oh, wow.

12:37.708 --> 12:38.958
[exhales]

12:39.041 --> 12:41.291
- Where's, uh, where’s Cam?
- In the car.

12:41.375 --> 12:45.208
So, let's get this show on the road,
Magnum, before your next case comes in.

12:45.291 --> 12:47.125
You can make fun of me all you like,

12:47.208 --> 12:50.000
but Tom Selleck was really something
back in the day.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.666
[laughing] Yeah, I'm sure.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.208
There you go, smart aleck.

12:57.041 --> 12:58.166
Oh!

12:58.250 --> 12:59.541
[somber music playing]

13:00.625 --> 13:03.000
Are you, uh, you sure
you don't want to keep these?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.166
[Mitchell] Yeah.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.083
No, it's, uh,
it's time they were with you.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.750
[Avery sighs]

13:13.250 --> 13:14.333
You ever hear from him?

13:14.416 --> 13:16.666
No. [chuckles] Never.

13:16.750 --> 13:20.166
I see his mom around from time to time.
She asks after you, you know.

13:22.000 --> 13:22.958
Ma?

13:23.500 --> 13:25.458
- Hm?
- Logan's here to see you.

13:25.541 --> 13:26.500
Logan who?

13:26.583 --> 13:28.041
Logan, your grandson.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.041
Oh.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.125
- Ah.
- Remember me?

13:32.166 --> 13:33.375
You're handsome.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.583
Oh, well, thank you, Grandma.

13:36.666 --> 13:39.291
It's a little strange,
but, um, how are you doing?

13:39.375 --> 13:40.375
Bored.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.500
Almost to death, but I'm not that lucky.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.833
Well, that's… that's pretty dark, Grandma,

13:45.916 --> 13:48.875
but I think I can help
with the boredom part.

13:49.958 --> 13:51.541
Here we go.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.083
[grandma] Oh, this one's my favorite.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.416
Have you seen this?
It never hits the corner.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.833
- [laughing]
- Can't say that I have, Grandma.

14:00.458 --> 14:01.666
Oh.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.375
- Mitchell, your suitcase is empty.
- Hm?

14:04.458 --> 14:05.833
Yes, my suitcase is empty

14:05.916 --> 14:09.166
because everything that's going into it
is in the wash right now, Susan.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.208
All of it?

14:10.291 --> 14:13.708
Yeah, sure. Yeah, colors,
whites, darks, the whole shebang.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.833
You know you're gonna ruin them.

14:15.916 --> 14:18.250
Does this look like a man
who cares about the way he looks?

14:18.333 --> 14:19.375
[chuckling]

14:19.458 --> 14:22.375
- We wish you were coming with us.
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.833
- Maybe next year.
- Yeah.

14:23.916 --> 14:27.416
With any luck,
we're gonna come back to a sold house.

14:28.833 --> 14:29.833
- Yeah.
- [Susan] Yeah.

14:29.916 --> 14:31.041
Love you. Have a good trip.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.666
Text me when you land.
Don't drink too much.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.250
- Love you too.
- Take care.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.958
Hm. I'm not sure
about the not drinking too much.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.166
I don't know about that.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.916
- I think you look really nice, by the way.
- I do too.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.083
- You care.
- I do too.

14:44.125 --> 14:48.416
- Why is the cable not working anymore?
- Oh, would you look at the time?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.208
- Honey, you gotta go.
- You should've told me.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.291
- We're fine.
- No, you're not fine. I can help.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.625
Well, you help enough already.

14:53.708 --> 14:57.333
It's just a lot right now
with the meds and the support staff.

14:57.416 --> 14:58.833
And it's… We're fine.

14:59.708 --> 15:02.625
Hey, big step.
Staying with the parents, huh?

15:02.708 --> 15:04.708
No, don't change the subject.

15:04.791 --> 15:06.125
Logan, would I lie to you?

15:06.208 --> 15:08.333
- Yes. 100%.
- [laughing]

15:09.625 --> 15:11.500
- Are you going to be okay?
- Yes.

15:11.583 --> 15:14.750
Al and Dan are coming Christmas Eve.
We'll do dinner when you're back.

15:14.833 --> 15:17.000
- Okay.
- Hey. Go get 'em.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.958
- I will. I love you.
- Love you.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.708
- Call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

15:21.791 --> 15:23.458
- I love you, Grandma.
- Yeah?

15:24.375 --> 15:27.333
[Cameron] Make sure to show some love
to the pup, okay?

15:27.416 --> 15:28.916
- Will do.
- Mom likes that.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.083
And don't worry, the dog does not bite,
does not bark. Very sweet.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.750
Okay. [laughs nervously] I wasn't…

15:34.833 --> 15:37.333
And oh! You've gotta try
my mom's chocolate cookies.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.625
- They're unreal.
- Okay, I'll try them.

15:39.708 --> 15:42.666
But she's very particular
about how many you eat, so be careful.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.375
- I won't eat a lot.
- She keeps a special batch just for me.

15:45.458 --> 15:48.083
- [Avery] Don't eat too many cookies.
- [Cam laughs] Exactly.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.541
If you're nice, I'll let you
have a bite of one of my cookies.

15:50.625 --> 15:51.458
[people laughing]

15:51.541 --> 15:53.291
- Oh my gosh. It already started.
- Yeah.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.333
- I thought we were gonna come earlier.
- Yeah.

15:55.416 --> 15:57.666
- I should've changed my clothes.
- It's okay. Hey. Hey.

15:57.750 --> 15:58.708
No, I'm nervous.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.666
Right.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.666
- Breathe.
- Okay.

16:00.750 --> 16:04.375
- You're good. You look beautiful.
- Breathing. [exhales] Really?

16:04.458 --> 16:07.333
- Yes. Come here.
- Okay. Thank you.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.291
Hope I'm interrupting.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.125
- Hi, darling.
- Hi, Mama.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.958
- Mrs. Morgan.
- Avery. Better late than never.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.541
[chuckles] This is for you.

16:17.583 --> 16:18.750
Thank you, dear.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.375
And look, it's a screw top.

16:22.583 --> 16:23.625
Fast and easy.

16:25.416 --> 16:26.958
- Hi. Oh!
- [barks]

16:27.041 --> 16:28.833
- No, ma'am. We won't eat our guests.
- [growls]

16:28.916 --> 16:30.000
That never happens.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.041
[Mrs. Morgan] Want to come in?
I'm so proud of you.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.416
- How are you doing?
- I'm tired.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.250
- You've been working too hard.
- Yeah, I have.

Here we go.

- [Mrs. Morgan] Guess what I made.
- Your cookies.

16:44.625 --> 16:48.041
- I made just for my boy. [laughing]
- [chuckling] I know. I know.

of pressure on you.

17:05.083 --> 17:09.125
Well, I gotta do something.
I just gotta figure out what.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.625
Ask Paul for the money.
He appears to be rolling in it.

17:12.708 --> 17:15.166
I've been asking Paul for more money
since the day I started.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.083
I get the same spiel every time.

"You bring in the business,
you get the payout." [talking gibberish]

17:20.833 --> 17:22.750
So why don't you bring in the business?

17:24.375 --> 17:26.958
Well, I don't think he ever expected me
to take that literally.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.833
But that is a very good idea.

Mm. I have a lot of good ideas, Logan.

Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

No. No. Come on.

What's wrong
with what I'm wearing? Seriously.

Oh, Logan. They're gorgeous.

And, you know, I'm sorry for being late.
I kinda got tied up at work.

Don't be silly. It must be hard
to get away when you're the big boss.

- Where are your bags?

18:13.625 --> 18:16.500
Uh, they're in the truck.
We can just get them after the party.

Nonsense. We'll have Callum get your bags.

Oh. Oh, uh, yes.
Sure thing. That's the truck.

18:35.958 --> 18:37.000
[Callum] Yep. Got it.

in your family Christmas.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.250
Of course.

Yeah. You too. [laughs]

19:15.583 --> 19:16.958
[Mrs. Morgan] Right. Well, Logan,

19:17.833 --> 19:20.166
there are a ton of people
who are just dying to meet you.

19:20.250 --> 19:21.583
- So come with me.
- Okay, yeah.

19:21.666 --> 19:23.750
Meet the neighbors.

I'm making a lot of money.

I'm raking in Bitcoin

19:39.541 --> 19:42.750
And, frankly, this time next year,
I think I'm gonna have a boat.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.541
And, uh… You're invited.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.250
[guests chatting and laughing]

19:54.166 --> 19:56.083
- [sighing]
- I'm feeling it. [gasps]

19:56.166 --> 19:57.250
I need food. I'm dying.

19:57.875 --> 20:00.041
- So where's your bathroom again?
- Oh, I'll show you.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.750
- Oh, it's fine. I can take him.
- Oh, no. You said you're hungry.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.750
You should eat this.
This one's really good.

20:04.833 --> 20:05.833
- Thanks.
- Come on.

20:06.458 --> 20:07.416
- Great.
- Mm, yes.

20:10.666 --> 20:11.500
Mmm.

20:12.083 --> 20:15.250
- Uh-oh. She means business, folks.
- [Avery] This cannot be happening.

20:16.208 --> 20:17.833
Okay, can we-- Let's just take a breath.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.416
Logan, you cannot tell anyone about us.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.500
Wait, this is funny. What's it been?

20:23.583 --> 20:25.041
It's been like ten years.

20:25.125 --> 20:28.666
I say we go out there,
we say that we dated, and we just move on.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.916
- Oh, you think this is funny?
- Yeah, I kinda do.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.500
Okay. You know what? Maybe you're right.

20:34.583 --> 20:37.708
Maybe we should go out there
and tell them all that we dated.

20:37.791 --> 20:41.208
That way, for the next four days,
they can picture us,

20:41.291 --> 20:43.958
you know, having S-E-X.

20:44.041 --> 20:44.958
S-E--

20:45.833 --> 20:47.875
Nothing to see here. Excuse me. Logan.

20:47.958 --> 20:49.458
- All right. All right.
- [Avery huffs]

20:50.458 --> 20:51.625
[sighing]

20:51.708 --> 20:55.041
Okay, yes. I see how
that might be, like, a little problematic.

20:55.125 --> 20:58.000
The last thing I need
is to give that woman ammunition.

20:58.541 --> 21:00.458
Erica? She seems like a delight.

21:00.541 --> 21:02.041
[scoffs] This is so typical of you.

21:02.125 --> 21:05.208
Just leave it to you to sweep in here
and charm the pants off that meanie.

21:05.291 --> 21:07.750
- She's… she's a meanie?
- Yeah, she's a meanie.

21:07.833 --> 21:10.750
Okay. Well, should we go,
like, tell the teacher on duty?

21:10.833 --> 21:14.416
Oh, sorry. I was just trying to speak
in terms that you're used to.

21:14.500 --> 21:18.166
Can you sign Cassie's report cards
or do they have to go home to her parents?

21:18.250 --> 21:21.416
You're very funny. Um, are we done here?

21:21.500 --> 21:22.625
Do we have an understanding?

21:24.291 --> 21:25.375
Yeah, sure.

21:25.958 --> 21:28.541
- Yes, or sure? What is it?
- Yes. We have a deal.

21:28.625 --> 21:29.583
Okay.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.291
After you.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.000
No. After you.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.875
You are a nightmare.

21:38.041 --> 21:38.875
[door closes]

21:38.958 --> 21:41.208
It's fine. It's gonna be fine. [exhales]

21:41.291 --> 21:42.541
- [Cassie] Logan.
- Hey.

21:43.125 --> 21:46.458
Logan, I want you to meet my parents'
best friends in the whole world.

21:46.541 --> 21:48.333
- This is Margaret.
- Hi. Logan.

21:48.916 --> 21:49.791
And Stan.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.208
- [Logan] Hi, good to meet you.
- Hi.

21:51.291 --> 21:52.250
Well.

21:52.333 --> 21:53.750
Well done, Cassie.

21:53.833 --> 21:54.916
Margaret.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.833
Oh, tsk. I'm just saying
what everybody else is thinking.

21:57.916 --> 22:01.291
Cassie tells us that you're,
like, a big development guy.

22:01.916 --> 22:06.208
Oh, um, well, I work in sort of
commercial and industrial real estate.

22:06.291 --> 22:09.458
We're just wrapping up a department store
at the north end of the city.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.125
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:11.208 --> 22:15.166
Stan's company is looking to build
a big lifestyle complex out of Marietta.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.333
- Maybe you two should talk shop.
- Honey.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.750
What do you mean, a lifestyle complex?

22:20.833 --> 22:23.125
It's a bit of a passion project
for people my age.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.833
Too old to be going to the clubs

22:24.916 --> 22:27.333
and too young
to be playing tranquilized chess.

22:27.416 --> 22:28.958
- Hear, hear.
- [laughing]

22:29.041 --> 22:30.291
That sounds fascinating.

22:30.375 --> 22:32.791
Um, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd love to hear more about it.

22:32.875 --> 22:35.083
Maybe… offer some thoughts?

22:35.166 --> 22:38.250
Ah, sure, why not?
I'll have my office send you the brief.

22:38.333 --> 22:39.666
I have to be transparent, though.

22:39.750 --> 22:42.875
We are looking to award the business
on January 1st.

22:42.958 --> 22:45.166
So all competing bids have to be in
by the 24th.

22:45.250 --> 22:46.875
Okay. Yeah. That's not a problem.

22:46.958 --> 22:49.375
- Can't wait to see his face.
- [laughs breathily]

22:49.458 --> 22:50.916
Well, look what I found.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.541
- [gasping]
- Sophie!

22:52.625 --> 22:54.833
- Sophie. What?
- Oh my gosh.

22:54.916 --> 22:58.583
Oh my gosh. I didn't know you were…
you were gonna be home.

22:58.666 --> 23:00.541
- I was hoping you'd be here.
- I had no idea.

23:00.625 --> 23:03.875
Well, I wanted it to be a surprise,
so I swore these two to secrecy.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.250
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

23:05.333 --> 23:08.583
Well, there you go.
Mission accomplished. Yeah.

23:08.666 --> 23:11.458
Oh, Soph. This is my girlfriend, Avery.
Avery, this is Sophie.

23:11.541 --> 23:13.458
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

23:13.541 --> 23:15.416
- How do you know each other?
- [Erica] These two?

23:15.500 --> 23:17.250
Oh, they've been inseparable
since the crib.

23:17.333 --> 23:21.208
Ah, yeah, well, then she left us
for the land down under.

23:21.291 --> 23:23.958
Yeah, but now we all get
free medical advice.

23:24.041 --> 23:25.083
That's true. Touché.

23:25.958 --> 23:26.958
Is Callum around?

23:27.041 --> 23:29.666
Oh, I'm sure he's around
wishing his night away.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.291
Ah, yes. There he is.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.416
Oh my God. How old is he?

23:33.500 --> 23:34.541
Eighteen-ish.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.750
"Ish?" I mean, he's exactly 18.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.291
That's what I said.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.208
Is it?

23:39.291 --> 23:41.958
Callum, no! Jeez, Leonard.

23:42.041 --> 23:45.208
Callum, what are you doing?
Are you kidding me? Put that down.

23:45.291 --> 23:49.125
- You told me I could have a drink.
- When you're 21, you can. You're a child.

23:49.208 --> 23:51.208
Odd how he's so old,
yet we haven't aged at all.

23:51.291 --> 23:54.291
Yeah, not at all.
A lot of moisturizer for me, so…

23:54.375 --> 23:57.916
Okay, Christmas crew, are you ready?
Guess what time it is.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.750
- Yes. I remember.
- I know.

23:59.833 --> 24:01.666
I don't know the drill. What's this for?

24:01.750 --> 24:04.541
Okay, this is Secret Santa.
It's our family's longest tradition.

24:04.625 --> 24:09.708
$50 limit, so be here
or be uninvited next year. [cackling]

24:10.333 --> 24:11.291
Oh. [chuckles]

24:11.375 --> 24:12.208
Who got me?

24:12.291 --> 24:13.416
I can't say who this is.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.291
- [Cameron] Okay, we can't say, Mom.
- I want you to get me.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.250

24:44.625 --> 24:46.166
It's like a horror movie.

24:46.958 --> 24:48.000
[scoffs]

24:52.291 --> 24:53.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:53.791 --> 24:54.958
[Avery sighs]

24:55.500 --> 24:57.875
Logan seems like an okay guy, huh?

24:57.958 --> 24:58.833
Mm-hmm.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.000
Sophie too.

25:02.291 --> 25:04.708
You know,
it's funny how you never mentioned her,

25:04.791 --> 25:06.333
given how close you guys were.

25:06.833 --> 25:07.916
Um…

25:08.000 --> 25:12.208
I mean, we've really only seen each other
a handful of times in the last decade.

25:12.291 --> 25:13.125
Ah.

25:13.208 --> 25:15.916
- Yeah.
- Your mom seems to really like her.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.416
Whoa, are you jealous?

25:17.500 --> 25:19.083
No, no, not at all.

25:19.666 --> 25:22.458
- No, she's just really tall and pretty.
- [laughs]

25:23.000 --> 25:25.208
Is she… is she tall? I didn't notice.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.791
- Oh, so you think she's pretty?
- No, I…

25:28.375 --> 25:29.208
Uh…

25:29.291 --> 25:32.625
I don't know.
Everyone's tall to me. I'm 5'7".

25:33.250 --> 25:34.958
I think you're beautiful.

25:35.041 --> 25:39.208
I think you're the perfect height,
and I didn't even notice,

25:39.291 --> 25:41.708
and my mom just takes a second
to warm up. Okay?

25:41.791 --> 25:42.625
Yeah, okay.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.208
She didn't like Cassie until she was 11.

25:45.291 --> 25:46.125
[snorting]

25:46.208 --> 25:49.250
Yeah. And Callum, I don't think
she likes him at all. Still.

25:49.333 --> 25:50.166
Very funny.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.541
I wish I was kidding.

25:52.291 --> 25:53.541
She's gonna love you.

25:54.750 --> 25:56.416
I hope so. Good night.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.083

- Morning.

26:17.791 --> 26:18.625
- Hi.
- Morning.

26:18.708 --> 26:20.875
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

26:20.958 --> 26:23.583

26:23.666 --> 26:25.208
Yeah, that would be great,

26:25.291 --> 26:29.166
except remember I told you we have
the family portrait we're doing today.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.708
- You what?
- Mm-hmm.

26:30.791 --> 26:33.541

to do final touches on everyone.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.125
Right, final touches.

26:35.208 --> 26:38.791
Mm. Yeah, I know,
but it's my mom's thing, so…

26:38.875 --> 26:40.750
- Little creepy.
- Yeah.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.750
[Erica] What's creepy?

26:41.833 --> 26:44.583
- [dramatic sting]
- Oh, no, creaky. I meant creaky.

26:44.666 --> 26:46.875
Uh, the bed
in his room is just a little creaky.

26:46.958 --> 26:51.583
Oh. Well, I'm sorry our accommodations
aren't up to your standards, Avery.

26:51.666 --> 26:53.250
Oh, no, I was just… just…

26:53.333 --> 26:54.916
Logan, how did you sleep?

26:55.500 --> 26:57.041
Oh, like a dream. Thank you so much.

26:57.125 --> 26:59.166
Now, that's what I like to hear.

26:59.666 --> 27:02.083
Avery, Logan's gonna go
get the real Christmas tree

27:02.166 --> 27:04.458
so we can decorate after church,
and you should go with him.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.583
- Oh?
- Uh, yeah, I don't wanna get in the way.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.750
That'll be fun. Yeah, you two can get
to know each other. You should go.

27:09.833 --> 27:10.916
Yeah.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.041
- Great.
- [Cameron] Great.

Now, everyone, don't forget,

27:14.458 --> 27:17.291
the children's mass
is at church today at 4 p.m.

Father Paul said that if y'all were
interested in doing a reading…

- Okay. It's just Jesus's birthday

but you do you.

Here, wear this.
I can't listen to you complain all day.

- Oh, no. I can't wear this.
- Why not?

31:17.208 --> 31:18.958
She'd probably chew his food for him.

31:19.041 --> 31:23.041

without her approval first.

to lead our children's story.

Miss Avery. Miss Avery.

39:48.375 --> 39:49.416
Wh-- What?

39:49.500 --> 39:50.500
Miss Avery.

39:51.166 --> 39:52.708
- What do I do?
- It's gonna be okay.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.541
- [Avery] What do I do?
- [Logan] I don't know.

39:54.625 --> 39:56.458
- What do I do?
- It's gonna be okay.

39:56.541 --> 39:58.625
- Is it?
- I don't know. Is it?

39:59.250 --> 40:01.375
- Do we--
- [whispering] Avery, what are you doing?

40:01.458 --> 40:02.750
[ethereal music playing]

40:03.958 --> 40:05.500
- Excuse me. Pardon.
- Are you sure?

40:06.583 --> 40:08.416
You forgot.

[Avery] <i>Okay. This is fine.</i>

40:21.333 --> 40:23.958
<i>One minor misstep.</i>
<i>It could happen to anyone.</i>

40:24.041 --> 40:27.875
<i>No one needs to know you're high.</i>
<i>Oh, wow, I am so high.</i>

40:27.958 --> 40:30.416
<i>This would be great</i>
<i>if I were anywhere but here.</i>

40:30.500 --> 40:32.750

40:34.291 --> 40:36.416
<i>Just smile. Nod.</i>

40:53.041 --> 40:55.125
<i>You did it. Look at you.</i>

40:55.666 --> 40:59.250
<i>Standing up here.</i>
<i>And no one suspects a thing.</i>

41:03.791 --> 41:05.791
This is a surprise for me.

41:05.875 --> 41:07.458
She's just standing there.

41:07.541 --> 41:08.791
[scraping]

41:08.875 --> 41:10.958
Avery, you should say something.

41:12.291 --> 41:14.708
Out loud. For all to hear.

[distorted, high-pitched clamoring]

41:29.958 --> 41:30.833
So.

41:32.291 --> 41:34.208
A long, long time ago,

41:34.291 --> 41:37.583
in a far, far away galaxy…

41:39.375 --> 41:41.125
It's gonna be great. She's warming up.

41:41.208 --> 41:42.291
Line.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.208
Bethlehem.

41:45.041 --> 41:47.458
Right. In Bethlehem,

41:48.125 --> 41:50.541
- Mary, the mom,
- [phone beeps]

41:50.625 --> 41:52.791
and Joseph, "the father,"

41:53.666 --> 41:56.375
they got all
their smartest friends together

41:56.458 --> 41:59.750
for a sort of, like,
you know, a baby shower.

42:00.958 --> 42:04.208
There's a party going on right here.

42:04.291 --> 42:08.166
A celebration
to last throughout the years.

42:08.250 --> 42:11.583
So bring your good times
and your laughter too.

42:11.666 --> 42:14.791
We're gonna celebrate this party with you.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.375
Is that Kool & The Gang?

42:17.458 --> 42:18.916
Yes, I think so. [chuckles]

42:19.916 --> 42:21.416
This is your celebration.

Here's a fun idea. How about

43:19.708 --> 43:20.750
I will deal with it.

43:20.833 --> 43:21.750
Well…

43:22.791 --> 43:25.250
- That was, um… a lot.
- Yeah. Let me exp--

- [priest] Miss Avery.
- Yes?

43:26.416 --> 43:27.791
- Excuse me, Avery.
- Yeah.

43:27.875 --> 43:30.041
Well, I must say that was not
what I was expecting.

43:30.125 --> 43:30.958
Yeah, I know--

43:31.041 --> 43:34.208
I can assure you,
it's not what any of us were expecting.

43:34.291 --> 43:36.083
That's right. It was better.

43:36.166 --> 43:37.125
Huh?

43:37.208 --> 43:38.166
I'm sorry. Pardon?

43:38.250 --> 43:41.208
I haven't seen the children,
the entire congregation,

43:41.291 --> 43:44.416
engaged in a service
like that in, well, ever.

43:45.208 --> 43:50.500
How you told the story of Jesus's birth
in such a fun and approachable way.

43:50.583 --> 43:53.708
It may not have been my style,
and largely inaccurate,

43:53.791 --> 43:54.791
[Cassie snickers]

43:54.875 --> 43:57.041

fair-weather worshipers.

44:00.041 --> 44:01.208
[laughs, clears throat]

44:01.291 --> 44:06.000
And I just heard some of the children
asking to come to the next service.

44:06.625 --> 44:08.000
Well, you don't say.

44:08.083 --> 44:10.750
- It's a Christmas miracle.
- Huh, must be. [laughs nervously]

44:10.833 --> 44:12.875
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

44:14.375 --> 44:16.000
Don't be a stranger.

No, it's okay. Leave that one alone.

[scoffs]

44:50.291 --> 44:53.208
- What are you doing up so late?
- Just working on some concepts.

44:58.166 --> 44:59.750
Oh. What are these?

45:00.333 --> 45:04.333
I was just messing with those.
This is the master here.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.166
Wh… what's wrong with these?

45:08.125 --> 45:11.208
Nothing's wrong with them,
but they're just not really practical.

45:11.291 --> 45:16.208
And for guys like Stan and my boss,
they just want things fast and cheap.

45:16.833 --> 45:19.041
I think these concepts are really great.

45:19.750 --> 45:21.000
Well, thank you very much.

45:22.250 --> 45:24.208
- And I'm starving.
- I bet you are.

45:26.541 --> 45:28.875
Oh, I emailed you that template
to work off of.

Doing what?

45:55.541 --> 45:56.666
Reaching for more.

45:57.541 --> 45:59.625
I was always
a little jealous of you that way.

You were jealous of me?

46:02.041 --> 46:03.583
Yeah, you just…

how to be happy, and I didn't.

Oh, you're talking about London.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.958
Yeah, not… not to rehash the past
or anything, but yeah.

46:19.666 --> 46:21.958
It didn't feel like
you were just going off to do a job.

46:22.041 --> 46:23.583
It felt like you were running away

46:23.666 --> 46:25.708
from everything
that reminded you of your mother.

46:25.791 --> 46:28.208
- Like home?
- And me.

46:28.291 --> 46:33.166
Well, that was like ten years ago, Logan.
I've changed a lot since then.

46:33.708 --> 46:36.625
[inhales] When was the last time
you were home for Christmas?

46:36.708 --> 46:37.583
Okay.

46:37.666 --> 46:38.500
No, I just…

46:39.333 --> 46:42.166
I don't want you to think
that I was fine, that I was happy,

46:42.250 --> 46:44.333
or that I just moved on, because I didn't.

46:45.250 --> 46:48.250
I know you lost the most important person
to you in the entire world that year,

46:48.333 --> 46:49.666
but so did I.

47:43.458 --> 47:46.875
[Erica] Good morning,
my little prince Camelot. How'd you sleep?

47:47.750 --> 47:48.791
[Cameron] I slept fine.

47:48.875 --> 47:52.708
You have to stop putting warm milk
by the bed. It freaked Avery out.

47:52.791 --> 47:54.583
- [Erica] Are you going out?
- [Cameron] I am.

47:54.666 --> 47:57.041
I have a work call,
so figured I'd get a walk in too.

47:57.125 --> 47:58.083
Okay, well, hurry back.

47:58.166 --> 48:00.541
I've got those ladies coming over
for the cookie exchange.

- I'm gonna need help--
- Okay. Yes, Mom.

Oh, shit. Oh, this is bad.

- Logan! Thank God.
- What? What?

48:07.000 --> 48:08.833
I need you to distract Erica
for three minutes.

48:08.916 --> 48:09.875
- Please.
- What? Why?

48:09.958 --> 48:11.833
- Are you hungry?
- I'm not. I'm really full.

48:11.916 --> 48:14.000
- You didn't have the cinnamon rolls?
- Not yet.

48:14.083 --> 48:15.958
- Is everything all right?
- No time for questions.

48:16.041 --> 48:18.583
- Just keep her far away from the kitchen.
- Okay, got it.

48:20.750 --> 48:23.125
[Cameron] I'm looking forward to 'em.
You made 'em fresh?

48:23.208 --> 48:25.416
- Why? Are you constipated?
- No, what does that have--

48:25.500 --> 48:28.250
- Sometimes I know those plug you up--
- [Logan] Hey. Hey.

48:28.333 --> 48:29.250
So sorry. Um.

48:29.791 --> 48:33.291
Could I actually speak with you
for a moment in… in private?

48:33.375 --> 48:35.416
In private? Why, yes, sir.

Um… So, I just… I just wanted to say,

48:52.625 --> 48:55.000
first and foremost,
thank you for… for having me.

48:55.083 --> 48:56.500

you wanted to speak with <i>moi </i>about?

49:08.208 --> 49:10.125
- There is.
- Is it…

49:11.250 --> 49:13.666
Are you going to ask me
what I think you're going to ask me?

49:15.000 --> 49:17.416
I… I… I… I think so.

- When you know, you know. You know?
- Yeah, I guess we know.

49:27.333 --> 49:29.541
- Oh, come here.
- You-- What's happening?

49:29.625 --> 49:31.458
Now sit and look guilty.

49:33.375 --> 49:34.708
- My future son.
- That's-- Yeah.

49:34.791 --> 49:35.916
[Avery] Veronica, no!

49:37.541 --> 49:38.500
[Erica] What happened?

49:38.583 --> 49:40.125
- She got into the cookies.
- [gasps]

How's that possible?
They were on the counter.

Where there's a will, there's a way.

49:45.250 --> 49:47.041

- Leonard left already.

49:48.791 --> 49:50.875
Well, somebody needs
to take me to the vet ASAP.

49:50.958 --> 49:52.791
What? Vet? No!
I don't think that's necessary.

49:52.875 --> 49:55.791
Avery. Chocolate is toxic to dogs.
She's three pounds.

49:55.875 --> 49:57.083
Oh, I didn't think of that.

49:57.916 --> 50:00.291
Okay, well, time is of the essence.
Let's go.

50:00.375 --> 50:01.875
Logan, please clean up.

50:02.708 --> 50:03.583
Yeah.

Oh my God.

50:21.083 --> 50:23.125
I can feel her heart
starting to slow down.

- [door opens]
- Well, hello, Veronica.

50:25.833 --> 50:27.166
Doctor, please help her.

50:27.250 --> 50:30.083

of chocolate cookies.

50:31.583 --> 50:33.708
I've never seen her this way before.

50:33.791 --> 50:36.708
So, what do we do, doc?
Just give her a pill?

50:36.791 --> 50:39.708
A lot of fluids? Just give us the goods,
and we'll be on our way.

50:39.791 --> 50:42.125
Well, unfortunately,
it's not that simple. Uh…

50:42.208 --> 50:44.791
For a dog this size to eat
that much chocolate,

50:44.875 --> 50:47.333
it means we're gonna
have to physically induce vomiting,

50:47.416 --> 50:50.875
flush her system with fluids,
and then force-feed her activated charcoal

50:50.958 --> 50:53.333

from getting into her bloodstream.

- No shit.

50:54.708 --> 50:56.708
Oh, please, doctor, whatever it takes.

50:56.791 --> 50:59.125
I feel her getting weaker
with each passing minute.

50:59.208 --> 51:01.791

- Oh God.

It's only gonna get harder,

I'm gonna stay here with Veronica, okay?
So you don't have to see this.

how to handle this situation

52:25.333 --> 52:26.583
in veterinary school.

52:26.666 --> 52:30.500
But I'm feeling it compromises
at least four ethical codes.

you two didn't spill the beans.

01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:46.458
Ding, ding, ding. Late breaking news,
but, of course, we're very excited.

01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:47.458
And proud.

01:12:47.541 --> 01:12:48.833
Soph, that's amazing.

01:12:48.916 --> 01:12:49.791
Thanks.

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:52.208
- [Cameron] This is great, Sophie.
- I'm just gonna clear--

01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:54.375
- [Stan] What are you doing?
- [Erica] Logan, uh-uh.

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:56.291
- Sit right back down. Uh-uh.
- I can do it.

01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:58.375
Absolutely not. You stay put.

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.833
- This is my house. You're my guest.
- [Logan] Okay.

01:13:00.916 --> 01:13:01.750
Leonard.

01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:04.625
[mischievous music playing]

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:06.500
Oh. Oh. Yeah.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.666
- [Callum] Can you take mine?
- Why don't I give you a hand?

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:13.041
[Logan] There we go.

01:13:13.125 --> 01:13:15.750
- [Cassie] Mmm. Thanks, bartender.
- [Logan] Of course, any time.

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:18.666
- Logan!
- Yeah.

01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:20.250
Excuse me one second.

01:13:21.166 --> 01:13:22.000
Hi.

01:13:23.208 --> 01:13:24.458
Is it happening?

01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:26.666
Is… Is what happening?

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.375
[whispering] Oh. Okay.

01:13:30.416 --> 01:13:33.083
Logan. Do you have a second to talk?

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.541
Yes. Um…

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:38.791
- I should probably go talk to Stan.
- Go. Go. Don't worry.

01:13:38.875 --> 01:13:39.833
- Okay.
- I know.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.750
- All right.
- [Erica squeals softly]

01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:44.000
Hey.

01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:46.708
So, have you had time
to take a look at my project?

01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:48.458
Yes, I have.

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:50.875
Excellent. Sorry to ruin your holiday.

01:13:50.958 --> 01:13:54.416
Oh, no. No, no. Um, it's upstairs.
Why don't I just go grab it?

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.750
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:13:56.875 --> 01:13:57.708
Hey.

01:13:58.416 --> 01:13:59.291
What are you doing?

01:13:59.375 --> 01:14:00.750
- Hey, Stan.
- Hi.

01:14:00.833 --> 01:14:02.625
- Secret Santa time.
- Oh, it's fun.

01:14:12.375 --> 01:14:13.708
[murmuring and laughing]

01:14:13.791 --> 01:14:15.208
[door banging]

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:22.416
[muffled moaning]

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.041
[dramatic sting]

01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:27.416
- Oh, sweetheart--
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.166
Hey, no. Do not close that door. Do not…

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.333
Close it. Close the door. Close the door.

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:34.375
Logan, it is not what it looks like.

01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:36.708
So you're not having an affair?

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:41.166
Well, it's a bit what it looks like.
But we have a plan.

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:42.291
- We do.
- Great.

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:45.125
The two of you have a plan.
That's good. Good for you. I'm going.

01:14:45.208 --> 01:14:48.583
We are gonna tell everyone, Logan.
We are. Just… just not now, okay?

01:14:48.666 --> 01:14:51.458
So we're gonna need you
to keep it under your hat.

01:14:51.541 --> 01:14:52.708
No, no, no, no.

01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:56.166
I have so much under my hat right now
that my skull is kind of concave.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:58.958
- Okay?
- Logan. Logan. Do this for Cassie.

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:00.583
Yes?

01:15:00.666 --> 01:15:03.625
Leonard, I did not expect this
from you, okay?

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.166
I did not expect it from you.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.750
Marge, I could see it coming
from a mile away.

01:15:07.833 --> 01:15:09.208
Why? You don't know me.

01:15:09.291 --> 01:15:11.125
[in Spanish] He doesn't know me.
Why would he say that?

01:15:11.208 --> 01:15:13.750
- He doesn't know you like I do.
- I know, my love.

01:15:13.833 --> 01:15:15.833
[in English] Does Erica even know
you speak Spanish?

01:15:15.916 --> 01:15:18.000
Really, can't you see
I'm in a loveless marriage?

01:15:18.083 --> 01:15:21.291
Everyone can see you're
in a loveless marriage. But you are old.

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:23.833
- That is just marriage at this point.
- You are not old.

01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:26.333
Please, Logan,
just let us get through Christmas.

01:15:26.416 --> 01:15:29.458
- We promise we'll tell. Please.
- Yes. We promise. We promise. Please.

01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:32.500
- [exhaling sharply]
- [Margaret] Please.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.500
Please.

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:36.916
- Okay. So here's what--
- Okay!

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:37.958
No! No, no, no.

01:15:38.958 --> 01:15:41.333
[Logan] For the rest of the evening,
we're going down there.

01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:42.958
We're gonna pretend nothing happened.

01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:46.583
And I don't want to see even a glance,
the slightest glimmer of a look

01:15:46.666 --> 01:15:49.833
between the two of you
for the rest of the night.

01:15:49.916 --> 01:15:51.583
- Yep.
- Are we clear?

01:15:51.666 --> 01:15:53.458
- No drifting looks like that.
- Okay.

01:15:53.541 --> 01:15:55.666
We're gonna-- Eyes forward. Eyes forward.

01:15:56.708 --> 01:15:58.125
Do we have an understanding?

01:15:58.625 --> 01:15:59.666
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:01.375
Great.

01:16:02.041 --> 01:16:04.625
- Now let's go play pretend. Shall we?
- Yep.

01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:08.333
- [Margaret] Thank you.
- [exhales]

01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:11.375
- [Erica] We've got Margaret's.
- [Margaret] Thank you.

01:16:11.458 --> 01:16:14.458
Leonard, yours is on the chair.
Did you give everybody their gifts?

01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:17.458
- Oh, Logan. I've got your gift right here.
- Thank you so much.

01:16:17.541 --> 01:16:20.083
[Erica] All right.
Now does everybody have a gift?

01:16:20.166 --> 01:16:21.333
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:22.250
[Cameron] Yes, we do.

01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:25.000
- Soph, why don't you get us started?
- Okay.

01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:28.125
Let's see. Hmm.

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:32.125
[gasping] Oh, bath salts.
You can never have enough of these.

01:16:32.916 --> 01:16:33.791
I got you those.

01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:35.583
I thought those looked familiar.

01:16:36.166 --> 01:16:39.083
Uh… Avery. Let's see you go next.

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.791
- Okay.
- [Erica] Show us what you got.

01:16:43.125 --> 01:16:44.166
[Leonard] Nice box.

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:47.916
- [Avery chuckles] Oh. Uh…
- [Erica] What is it?

01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:49.916
- It's candy.
- [Leonard] Oh.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.625
[Erica] Callum, seems like a you gift.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.708
You could've put a bit more thought
into that, son.

01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:54.958
I didn't get that.

01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:57.750
I swear. I actually got you, Mom.

01:16:58.333 --> 01:16:59.208
You should open it.

01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:03.291
Well, if you insist. [giggling]

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:05.625
Okay. I do love Secret Santa.

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:08.541
- Especially when it's my turn.
- [Leonard] Never would've guessed it.

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:11.375
Oh, okay. Let's see. Oh, my goodness.

01:17:15.458 --> 01:17:18.416
- Callum, that was a strong choice for Mom.
- Nice.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.166
- [Leonard] What?
- [Erica] What in the world?

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:22.416
- I didn't buy that.
- You sure? You just said you did.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.708
No. No. Logan did.

01:17:23.791 --> 01:17:25.916
- [Erica] What?!
- [Sophie] Oh my God.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.791
- Yes, I did.
- Wh-- For my wife?

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:30.125
No. No. I bought it for your daughter.

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:31.458
Oh, this is mortifying.

01:17:31.541 --> 01:17:32.500
- [Logan] Sorry.
- Oh God.

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:34.291
- She did ask for it.
- Uh…

01:17:34.375 --> 01:17:36.208
- Well…
- I'm so confused.

01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:37.583
Callum, a word?

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:41.250
Yeah, actually, Callum,
I'd like a word too.

01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:42.458
You know, I think it fits.

01:17:42.541 --> 01:17:44.541
- Honey, put it in the box.
- [Cassie] Mom, it's mine.

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:46.916
[dramatic music playing]

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.916
Listen, you little hellion. We had a deal.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.208
It's his fault.

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:54.750
Yes, that was an honest mistake.
It was a gross one, but a real one.

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.458
Hear me when I say,
if you expose this arrangement,

01:17:57.541 --> 01:18:00.583
I won't hesitate to tell everyone
about your extracurricular activities.

01:18:04.208 --> 01:18:05.083
You're a monster.

01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:06.791
Hmm. Takes one to know one.

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:07.708
[doorbell rings]

01:18:07.791 --> 01:18:09.666
- Honey--
- [Cameron] You always think you know…

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:10.666
Who's this now?

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:11.625
[Cassie] Come in.

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:14.000
- Hello. Merry Christmas.
- Hi. Merry Christmas.

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:16.291
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Ooh. Glad to be here.

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:18.916
- [Cassie] He's gonna be so surprised!
- Let's just…

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.333
Surprise!

01:18:20.875 --> 01:18:22.125
- Oh! Huh?
- [grandma] Surprise.

01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:25.666
- Grandma. Mom. What're you doing here?
- [Cassie laughs] I invited them.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:28.958
- You did? That was so kind of you. Hi Mom.
- Hi.

01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:31.291
Avery's here. Don't ask questions.
You do not know her.

01:18:31.375 --> 01:18:34.250
[Leonard] Leonard. This is Erica. Welcome.

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:37.208
Avery, what the hell are you doing here?

01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:39.583
Well, how do… How do you know her?

01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:41.541
What? No, she doesn't.

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:43.041
She… she has dementia.

01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:45.416
Well, she just called her name.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.916
Give me a hug, you little shit. Come here.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.208
Grandma, we shouldn't hug people
if we don't know them.

01:18:50.291 --> 01:18:54.000
- Uh, Ida, how do you two know each other?
- Oh, well… [chuckling]

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.750
[tense music playing]

01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:02.125
[spluttering]

01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:04.375
I… I don't remember.

01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:05.875
- [Logan] Yeah.
- [Erica] Oh.

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:07.666
- It's okay.
- Poor thing.

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:11.500
Oh, oh,
but I do remember catching these two

01:19:11.583 --> 01:19:15.500
going at it like jackrabbits
in the back of your mother's car.

01:19:15.583 --> 01:19:19.083
- I couldn't forget that if I tried.
- [Logan's mom] No, no, no. Ma, shh.

01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:22.041
- What?
- Logan, what is she talking about?

01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:25.666
Avery? Are you… Are you… Are you serious?

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:27.791
You two know each other?

01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:30.291
Um. Okay. So…

01:19:30.875 --> 01:19:31.791
Uh…

01:19:32.958 --> 01:19:34.875
[curious music playing]

01:19:34.958 --> 01:19:36.375
This is actually a funny story.

01:19:36.458 --> 01:19:38.083
- If you think about it.
- Oh my God.

01:19:38.166 --> 01:19:40.708
- Is it? Actually, it does sound hilarious.
- [Erica] Okay.

01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:44.000
- It sounds hilarious, actually.
- Let's take a beat, okay?

01:19:44.083 --> 01:19:46.458
I'm sure it's not as strange as it seems.

01:19:46.541 --> 01:19:48.083
- [groans]
- Wanna bet?

01:19:48.166 --> 01:19:49.500
[tense music playing]

01:19:50.833 --> 01:19:51.833
[exhaling]

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.708
All right. Yes. We dated.

01:19:58.708 --> 01:20:01.666
But it was like a million years ago,
and we didn't want you to freak out.

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:03.125
- So we just--
- Lied?

01:20:04.541 --> 01:20:06.666
Well, I wouldn't… Not lying, but…

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:08.125
Wow. Okay.

01:20:08.791 --> 01:20:11.208
All right. Uh, that's it? Nothing else?

01:20:11.291 --> 01:20:13.083
Anything else you wanna share?
That covers it?

01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:16.416
Whoa. [scoffs]
Is there anything else you wanna tell me?

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.666
Um. What? No.

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:21.666
[snickering]

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.250
What's so funny, huh? Twerp.

01:20:25.125 --> 01:20:26.375
- Nothing.
- [Logan] Okay, look.

01:20:26.458 --> 01:20:30.583
Avery wanted to tell you, but I didn't
because I thought it'd get weird.

01:20:30.666 --> 01:20:34.041
That's not true. Logan wanted to tell you.
I thought it would get weird.

01:20:34.125 --> 01:20:35.375
Well, it's definitely weird.

what it took to go all the way.
