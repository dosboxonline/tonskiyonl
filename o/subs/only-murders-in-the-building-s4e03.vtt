you'd get it.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.448
[Charles] A bullet that size
would have a bit of kick.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.910
So, is that eye patch covering
antibiotic-resistant pink eye

10:17.910 --> 10:21.872
- or a bruise from the recoil of a gun?
- [♪ jaunty music playing]

10:21.872 --> 10:24.374
Okay, well, I've heard enough. [laughs]

10:24.374 --> 10:26.835
We have our killer!

10:28.045 --> 10:29.963
My Mabel's confident.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.717
Okay, uh, please don't ever
touch my murder board.

10:33.717 --> 10:37.596
We met Vince. There's no way
he's strong enough to carry Sazz's body.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.389
Rudy Thurber, on the other hand,

10:39.389 --> 10:42.351
"Christmas All the Time Guy,"
he's pretty jacked.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.728
- Mm-hmm, I've heard enough.
- [puts glass down]

10:45.562 --> 10:47.773
We have our killer.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.983
My Mabel can admit when she's wrong.

10:50.526 --> 10:53.362
Charles, does this man
have any reason to hate you?

10:53.362 --> 10:54.530
No!

10:54.530 --> 10:56.698
Well, maybe the Christmas tree thing.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.411
I got everyone to sign a petition
banning real Christmas trees.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.872
- [Oliver sighs]
- They're a fire hazard.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.290
They are that.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.209
But who would kill someone
over something like that?

11:07.209 --> 11:10.295
Someone whose whole
identity is loving Christmas.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.548
Okay, but he was out of town
the night Sazz was killed.

11:12.548 --> 11:15.133
Or was he? We found this

11:15.133 --> 11:16.927
by the window at Dudenoff's.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.429
It kind of looks like Christmas tinsel.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.015
That could place Rudy here
that night after all.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.601
Yes! Yes.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.813
- Killer!
- Again with the touching.

11:27.813 --> 11:31.400
"Ooh! Looks like Rudy the Red Hot Reindeer
has been caught red-handed!"

11:31.400 --> 11:33.026
Something, something, Bea Arthur.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.328
Why choose? We can divide and conquer.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.706
Uh, you and Eugene go and see Vince,

11:45.706 --> 11:48.500
and Mabel and Eva visit Rudy.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.627
Alright! I'm gonna go fire my agent
and visit my kids.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.921
- Thanks, everybody!
- [Oliver] No! I mean...

11:54.047 --> 11:57.509
No. Y-You and I have something
very important to do back at my apartment.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.677
Um...

12:00.053 --> 12:02.848
Uh, monitor this ham radio
that we got from Dudenoff's.

12:02.848 --> 12:05.184
And...

12:05.184 --> 12:08.437
should you fall in love with me
because of my relentless charm assault,

12:08.437 --> 12:11.982

12:34.922 --> 12:37.883
You ask for a glass of water.
I tell a great joke.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.636
You do a spit take.
You spray water all over his face.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.554
And then, when he's--
when he's drying his face,

12:42.554 --> 12:45.265
he's forced to remove the eye patch.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.186
That's one of the stupidest things
I've ever come out with.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.730
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Charles. I'm...

12:51.730 --> 12:53.774
still a little nervous.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.192
I'm nervous playing you.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.861
- I get it. It's a challenge.
- [Eugene] 'Cause, you know,

12:57.861 --> 13:00.489
I've only played the dullest pencils

I mean, you know, th-th-the fearlessness,
the complexity.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.671

"Am I watching a TV show,

How do we approach Rudy?

13:42.948 --> 13:46.285
What do we do, tackle him?
Accuse him? Watch him squirm?

13:46.285 --> 13:48.328
I'd like to stay away
from sexual manipulation.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.914
I mean, I'm not closed off to it
because I'm good at it. But...

13:50.914 --> 13:54.877
Okay, "Mabel." I think there's
been a misunderstanding here.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.504
Oh, hey, are we attached to "Mabel"?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.298

It's just such an old person name,

What about, um...

14:08.724 --> 14:11.768

14:14.188 --> 14:16.356

Oliver and I found this tinsel
in the sniper's nest.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.782
So I need to go to Rudy's
and see if it matches

14:25.782 --> 14:28.243
any of the tinsel there
without tipping him off.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.965

is covering the same thing,
you know, pesky conjunctivitis,

18:04.126 --> 18:07.087
y-you may wanna remove it,

Oh, y-yes, and--
Uh, well, my tale is simple.

18:36.575 --> 18:39.328
Uh, my, my cousin is an ophthalmologist.

18:39.328 --> 18:42.039
Dr. Savage. Salazar Savage.

- I-I'm sorry. Where is this going?
- I'll tell you where this is going!

19:09.983 --> 19:13.445
My cousin developed
a cutting-edge pink eye treatment

19:13.445 --> 19:16.323
from the native, uh, lava cactus--

19:16.323 --> 19:18.492
Which is not available here

19:18.492 --> 19:21.245
due to some trivial FDA regulations,

19:21.245 --> 19:24.456
and I will not go into detail about that.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.832
Yeah, anyway, the point is--

19:25.832 --> 19:28.710
Oh, thank God, yes! The point being...

19:28.710 --> 19:31.797
The point is I was recently sent a bottle
