Once we are fully bare, thus unified
with our natural surroundings,

02:57.010 --> 03:00.472

Klyden will flee into the forest.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.266
Shortly after, I will follow in pursuit.

the Sexual Event there among the trees.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.190

are thus formally renewed

03:21.993 --> 03:24.746
If you both ultimately
want to be back together,

03:24.829 --> 03:26.581
why wouldn't he just let you catch him?

03:26.664 --> 03:30.669
- If the pursuit is dishonest,
the mating is seen as false.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.462
Such a tactic has been known

03:32.545 --> 03:35.465
to negatively affect the bonding
for years afterward.

- Alara!
- Whoa!

01:11:48.892 --> 01:11:51.394
[laughing]

01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:52.437
- Hi, Isaac.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.022
CLAIRE: I can't believe you're here!

01:11:54.105 --> 01:11:55.231
- Surprise!
- GORDON: Hey!

01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:56.775
- You made it.
- Welcome back.

01:11:56.858 --> 01:11:59.944
- So good to see you!
- Oh, my god, you came
all this way just for us?

01:12:00.028 --> 01:12:03.281
- Oh, come on, you're like family.
- Thank you so much.

01:12:03.365 --> 01:12:04.991
- I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony.

01:12:05.075 --> 01:12:07.494
I really wanted to be there,
but I got held up at the conference.

01:12:07.577 --> 01:12:09.871
- Yeah, I heard you were
working out tactical parameters

01:12:09.954 --> 01:12:11.956
for Selayan outpost design,
congratulations.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.460
- Well, I've got a bit of a climb
up the ladder before things get good,

01:12:15.543 --> 01:12:18.171
but I'm moving faster than I expected.

01:12:18.254 --> 01:12:20.006
- Hey there!
- Hi, Talla!

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:22.175
How's my old seat--
you taking care of it?

01:12:22.258 --> 01:12:23.968
Couple of scratches
that weren't there before,

01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:25.303
otherwise just how you left it.

01:12:25.387 --> 01:12:28.098
- Alara, I know
you only have a limited time

01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:30.016
in off-world gravity each year.

01:12:31.184 --> 01:12:33.144
It means a lot that you've joined us.

01:12:33.228 --> 01:12:35.021
[spoon tapping glass]

01:12:35.105 --> 01:12:38.525
- And you got here just in time
to watch things go off the rails.

01:12:39.025 --> 01:12:40.193
- What do you mean?

01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:44.531
- May I have your attention!

01:12:44.614 --> 01:12:48.201
[indistinct chatter continues]

01:12:53.289 --> 01:12:55.125
Attention, please!

01:13:01.297 --> 01:13:03.383
You will be silent!

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:06.469
[owl hooting]

01:13:06.553 --> 01:13:09.597
I will now give the wedding toast.

01:13:10.098 --> 01:13:14.436
In human tradition, this consists
of a series of good-natured jabs,

01:13:14.519 --> 01:13:16.354
followed by earnest wishes.

01:13:16.438 --> 01:13:19.607
- I told him that. Like, verbatim.
This is such crap.

01:13:19.691 --> 01:13:21.609
[Alara elbows Gordon]
- Dr. Finn.

01:13:21.693 --> 01:13:26.281
Many crew members have privately
frowned upon your mating with Isaac.

01:13:26.364 --> 01:13:28.450
They feel it will not succeed.

01:13:28.533 --> 01:13:32.078
All kidding aside, I wish you well.

01:13:33.329 --> 01:13:34.456
Isaac.

01:13:34.539 --> 01:13:35.957
You betrayed us.

01:13:36.041 --> 01:13:39.169
Your actions caused
the destruction of many ships

01:13:39.252 --> 01:13:41.129
and the deaths of many people.

01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:45.717
All kidding aside,
congratulations on this day.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.802
- He is very good!

01:13:47.886 --> 01:13:49.095
- Dr. Finn.

01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:51.431
I do not believe an artificial life form

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:54.642
is capable of properly raising
your children.

01:13:54.726 --> 01:13:57.437
He will most likely fail in this attempt.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.356
All kidding aside--

01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:00.607
- Commander Bortus.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:06.237
Thank you
for your well-prepared address.

01:14:06.321 --> 01:14:10.325
I would like to hear
what Lieutenant Malloy has to say.

01:14:12.494 --> 01:14:13.661
Lieutenant.

01:14:14.329 --> 01:14:15.789
- Oh! [laughs]

01:14:16.956 --> 01:14:18.124
Oh-- Okay.

01:14:19.376 --> 01:14:20.919
Yeah.

01:14:21.002 --> 01:14:23.338
[clears throat]
[guests murmuring]

01:14:23.421 --> 01:14:25.924
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:14:28.343 --> 01:14:29.427
[clears throat] Um, hey!

01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:32.055
Hey, how about a big hand
for Bortus, everyone?

01:14:34.307 --> 01:14:36.142
- Hooray!

01:14:37.936 --> 01:14:39.062
- Okay.

01:14:40.271 --> 01:14:42.524
I got it. I got it.

01:14:44.609 --> 01:14:46.861
I-I wish I had prepared
something in advance,

01:14:46.945 --> 01:14:48.780
but I'll do my best.

01:14:49.322 --> 01:14:51.282
Well, um...

01:14:51.366 --> 01:14:54.619
it's a big day, and a happy day.

01:14:54.703 --> 01:14:58.748
And there's a lotta big life changes
in store for Claire and Isaac.

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:04.045
First off, I'd like to congratulate them
on moving 50 meters closer together.

01:15:04.129 --> 01:15:06.256
[laughter]

01:15:06.339 --> 01:15:09.092
I guess it's safe to say
that marriage is gonna be easy

01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:11.469
compared to what
we've all been through together.

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:14.556
Although it is marriage to Isaac,
so maybe not.

01:15:14.639 --> 01:15:16.599
[laughter]

01:15:16.683 --> 01:15:19.477
The fact that Claire is my doctor
and she's seen me naked

01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:24.482
and is still marrying another man
is incredibly insulting, but...

01:15:24.566 --> 01:15:26.860
[guests laughing]

01:15:26.943 --> 01:15:30.030
...I bow to the victor.
Well done, Isaac.

01:15:30.113 --> 01:15:31.865
[laughter]
- Anyway...

01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:35.368
I'll keep this short,
because I know the Kaylon have, like,
a thousand light-year drive home,

01:15:35.452 --> 01:15:36.870
and most of them have been drinking.

01:15:36.953 --> 01:15:39.330
[laughter]

01:15:39.414 --> 01:15:41.458
But, um...

01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:44.878
I just wanna say that both of you

01:15:44.961 --> 01:15:47.672
mean a lot to this entire crew.

01:15:48.506 --> 01:15:50.508
We've served together,

01:15:50.592 --> 01:15:52.344
we've laughed together,

01:15:52.427 --> 01:15:55.138
and we all owe each other our lives.

01:15:55.221 --> 01:15:56.723
So...

01:15:57.390 --> 01:16:02.687
when two of us find love with each other,
we all feel it together.

01:16:03.813 --> 01:16:05.732
And it's a very special thing.

01:16:07.817 --> 01:16:09.611
So, um...

01:16:11.279 --> 01:16:12.864
[guests sitting up]

01:16:12.947 --> 01:16:16.618
I wish the two of you
a long, happy marriage.

01:16:16.701 --> 01:16:18.870
I know it's gonna be a huge success,

01:16:18.953 --> 01:16:21.956
and if it's not, the good news is,
Isaac is fully recyclable.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.959
[laughter]

01:16:27.754 --> 01:16:29.673
Here's to you both. Cheers.

01:16:29.756 --> 01:16:31.800
GUESTS: Cheers!

01:16:31.883 --> 01:16:33.843
[cheering and applause]

01:16:33.927 --> 01:16:37.347
- Yeah!
[whistling]

01:16:38.264 --> 01:16:39.891
Go on, now.

01:16:39.974 --> 01:16:41.267
Okay.

01:16:43.812 --> 01:16:46.147
- Gordon. That was beautiful.

01:16:46.231 --> 01:16:48.483
Uh... Would you sing a song for us?

01:16:49.109 --> 01:16:50.902
- Uh... right now?

01:16:50.985 --> 01:16:51.986
- Yeah.

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:55.198
- Right, guys?
- Yeah! Come on!
- Come on, Gordon, sing us a song!

01:16:55.281 --> 01:16:57.117
- Uh... okay.

01:16:59.661 --> 01:17:00.829
All right.

01:17:03.039 --> 01:17:05.208
Hey, uh, can I borrow that?
