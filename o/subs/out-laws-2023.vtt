- It was my class.

- Right?

15:22.416 --> 15:24.958

through the class, Owen's in child's pose.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.833
Yep. Okay, so get this.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.791
Okay, I'm in child's pose.

15:32.791 --> 15:37.208
And while I'm in child's pose,
I pass out, but no one notices. Look.

15:37.208 --> 15:38.166
[laughing] Look.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.333
If I was unconscious right now,
you couldn't even tell.

- [Billy] Oh, yeah.

15:42.583 --> 15:45.000
So then everyone leaves, class is over,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.416
and I notice that
Owen's still in child's pose.

15:47.416 --> 15:48.625

"Oh, fuck. This guy just died.
He's dead. He's a goner."

- Mmm-mmm. But I didn't.
- [Parker] Nope.

Then, when Parker unfolded me,
and I came to,

15:57.333 --> 16:00.583
I looked up at her big, beautiful smile,
and I realized...

16:01.958 --> 16:04.458
"This is the woman
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with."

- Yes, I was.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.125
Aww.

- No, actually.

19:48.791 --> 19:49.791

19:52.541 --> 19:53.791
Mind the shoes, Owen.

19:53.791 --> 19:55.625
My bad, Mister Dad. [laughing]

19:55.625 --> 19:57.541

- [Owen exclaims]

19:57.541 --> 19:59.958
Okay, that one was a little on you,

19:59.958 --> 20:02.416
'cause you didn't turn around
that quickly. That's okay.

20:02.416 --> 20:03.541
- [Billy] Sit!
- Yeah.

20:03.541 --> 20:04.583
Stay.

20:04.583 --> 20:05.666
Okay!

20:13.291 --> 20:14.875
- I'll be right back.
- [Billy] Oh, no.

20:14.875 --> 20:17.833
I'll go. You keep him company. All right?

20:20.291 --> 20:22.750
[Owen] God!
He is just the coolest, isn't he?

20:22.750 --> 20:25.833
It is so awesome
that you get to have sex with him.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.916
- Really?
- And he smells so good!

20:27.916 --> 20:28.958
It smells like...

20:29.750 --> 20:31.166
sandalwood and...

20:31.166 --> 20:32.083
and danger.

20:32.083 --> 20:35.083
- It's Stetson. Cologne.
- Is that what that is?

20:35.083 --> 20:37.000
[sniffing]

20:39.333 --> 20:40.833
How you doing, big fella?

20:46.375 --> 20:50.458
Nice to see you again, Billy.
You look hella fine.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.250
Ah, if you say so.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.916
So tell me, what does
a bank manager do, exactly?

20:55.916 --> 20:57.625
What does a bank manager not do?

20:57.625 --> 21:00.583
I manage all of the employees.

21:01.416 --> 21:03.833
And we have 12.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.000
Really?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.541
And I handle all the security,
the whole dang bank.

21:07.541 --> 21:10.875
- How did you find us?
- That little cunt over there.

21:10.875 --> 21:14.041
- [Billy laughs]
- He called about the storage locker.

21:14.625 --> 21:16.416
- Did he?
- New colleague?

21:16.416 --> 21:18.958
Uh, no, he's just a family friend.

21:19.916 --> 21:23.458
He's an idiot.
Doesn't know what's going on.

21:24.833 --> 21:26.666
He looks like a fucking idiot.

21:28.166 --> 21:29.125
- Yup.
- [Owen] Billy!

Jesus, there you are.
Oh, you smell like my stepdad's car.

21:52.708 --> 21:54.750
[man] So, uh,
how did it go with your in-laws?

21:54.750 --> 21:58.541
Was it regular bad,
or like really, really terrible?

21:59.500 --> 22:00.708
It was incredible.

22:00.708 --> 22:03.250
I've never met anyone
like these people before.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.208
We went skydiving.

22:05.208 --> 22:06.708
We got very drunk.

22:06.708 --> 22:08.208
I did a little dancing.

22:08.208 --> 22:11.458
I finally felt like I was
part of the cool crowd in high school,

22:11.458 --> 22:15.958
like I'm a skateboarder,
or like I vandalize stuff or something.

22:15.958 --> 22:19.000
I don't, but it feels like I could.

22:19.583 --> 22:22.416
It was fun. It was almost too much fun.

22:22.416 --> 22:26.750
Let's just pray to the banking gods
that we have a nice, chill day.

22:26.750 --> 22:29.500

that this is a state-of-the-art,
completely impenetrable security system.

And there is no way
you can pass there in under two--

an extremely lucky guess.

31:11.208 --> 31:14.333
- It's all right, we'll get a new cake.
- All right. Yeah.

31:14.333 --> 31:18.750
Definitely not a racist this time.
[laughing] All right, love you.

31:23.000 --> 31:23.875
Hi.

31:24.541 --> 31:26.833
I'm going to need to cancel a cake order.

31:26.833 --> 31:30.041
Yeah, my fiancée was kicked
in the head by a horse.

31:31.833 --> 31:33.541
- [vomiting on video]
- [Oldham] Huh.

31:33.541 --> 31:36.083
[suspenseful music playing]

31:39.500 --> 31:42.041
Why are you so nervous, Owen?

31:44.166 --> 31:46.166
So, I know this might sound crazy,

31:46.791 --> 31:48.458
but I think Parker's parents

31:50.000 --> 31:51.208
might be criminals.

31:51.208 --> 31:53.541
- Yeah!
- Well, of course they're criminals.

31:53.541 --> 31:55.916
Why do you think
they're skipping their daughter's wedding?

31:55.916 --> 31:58.541
They're coming
to the fucking wedding! Okay?

31:59.125 --> 32:01.541
[sputtering] They're literally coming!
We're--

32:03.250 --> 32:04.083
Okay.

32:05.083 --> 32:07.791
I think that they are the people
that robbed my bank.

32:07.791 --> 32:10.125
- No! How do you know?
- I don't.

32:10.125 --> 32:13.458
But I'm not gonna turn Parker's life
upside down unless I do know for a fact,

32:13.458 --> 32:14.666
so I need your help, okay?

32:14.666 --> 32:16.958
Okay, okay, here they come.
Do that thing you guys do.

32:16.958 --> 32:17.916
What thing?

32:17.916 --> 32:21.208
That thing where you ask highly-invasive,
inappropriate personal questions.

32:21.208 --> 32:22.666
Hmm? Okay, come on!

32:22.666 --> 32:25.416
[loudly] Hi, guys! Hey!

32:25.416 --> 32:27.875
Honey. You sure you're up for this?

32:27.875 --> 32:29.708
- Yeah, you?
- Oh, yeah. I took a weed gummy.

32:29.708 --> 32:33.791
Smart! Billy and Lilly McDermott,
meet my parents Neil and Margie Browning.

32:33.791 --> 32:36.083
- Pleasure to me you, Neil.
- It's my pleasure.

32:36.916 --> 32:38.916
- You're very attractive.
- Oh, thank you.

32:38.916 --> 32:42.000
That's not a compliment.
For me, it's too much.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.750
[Lilly] Well, hi, there.

32:54.750 --> 32:55.875
- Hi, hello.
- [Margie] Hi.

32:56.666 --> 32:58.208
[Lilly] Mmm! Oh, wow!

32:58.208 --> 33:02.958
Speaking of attractive,
you have absolutely flawless skin.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.625
What do you use?

33:04.625 --> 33:05.541
Soap.

33:06.791 --> 33:09.500
- Perhaps we should have some cocktails?
- [Lilly] Yeah, cocktails.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.083
The sun is still out.

33:13.041 --> 33:15.291
[laughs nervously] Okay, we got a table.
Let's sit down.

33:15.291 --> 33:16.708
It's gonna be fun!

33:17.416 --> 33:19.875
- [McDermotts laughing]
- And then I said,

33:19.875 --> 33:21.833
"We don't need a gondolier!"

33:21.833 --> 33:24.125
Lilly, she pushes
the wee fella off the boat,

33:24.125 --> 33:26.291
and we start paddling up the Grand Canal.

33:26.291 --> 33:28.875
[all exclaiming and laughing]

33:29.833 --> 33:32.666
So, Billy, Lilly,
let me ask you something.

33:32.666 --> 33:33.750
[Billy] Yeah, shoot.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.833
- Have you ever committed a felony?
- [Owen gags] Mmm-mmm.

33:36.833 --> 33:37.916
[Margie] No, no, no!

33:37.916 --> 33:41.583
Now, if we're gonna be family,
we need to know if they're criminals, so...

33:42.083 --> 33:44.458
- [Owen] Stop. Don't.
- Give me that. Are you criminals?

33:44.458 --> 33:46.250
My parents aren't criminals.

33:46.250 --> 33:47.875
No, that's okay, baby.

33:47.875 --> 33:51.958
I'm sure our lifestyle seems a little,
um, unconventional to the Brownings.

33:51.958 --> 33:56.166
Well, yeah, I mean they live
in the jungle with the edamame people.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.333
[Owen] No, that's a bean.

33:57.333 --> 33:59.250
- [Neil] What's the name?
- Yanomami.

33:59.250 --> 34:00.166
What'd I say?

34:00.166 --> 34:03.291
You said edamame,
like at a Japanese restaurant.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.625
They are the people
of <i>waitheri, totihi, peheti.</i>

34:06.625 --> 34:08.041
What is that now?

34:08.041 --> 34:10.958
It's a common Yanomami phrase.
I'm sure you've heard it.

34:10.958 --> 34:14.666
- Honey, what are you doing?
- Nothing! Just striking up a convo.

34:15.166 --> 34:16.416
[laughs nervously]

34:16.416 --> 34:19.625
Owen, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were quizzing us.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.875
No! It's just... You lived
with the Yanomamis for two years.

34:22.875 --> 34:27.000
I'm sure you know what the phrase
<i>"waitheri, totihi, peheti"</i> means.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.416
It means courage...

34:33.583 --> 34:35.541
beauty, and truth.

34:36.250 --> 34:40.916
And if we seem a little confused,
it's because your accent is so atrocious,

34:40.916 --> 34:44.958
it's an affront
to the Yanomami people and their god!

34:48.291 --> 34:51.041
Owen, what the hell is wrong with you?

34:51.041 --> 34:55.000
Anyway!
[laughing] The Amazon is a wondrous place.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.875
You two would love it.

34:56.875 --> 35:01.541
Well, we don't travel.
Um, Neil has traveler's diarrhea.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.666
- It's not just when I travel.
- [Billy] Yeah.

35:04.666 --> 35:08.416
Oh, Margie,
I bet under that cautious exterior,

35:08.416 --> 35:12.541
there's a bubbling free spirit
waiting to get out.

35:12.541 --> 35:17.125
Oh, no doubt this one
was really wild back in the day.

35:17.125 --> 35:23.708
Uh, well, once,
before I was pregnant with Owen, I, um...

35:23.708 --> 35:26.333
Well, I participated in an orgy.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.375
[laughing]

35:27.375 --> 35:29.166
- What?
- Yeah! [laughs]

35:29.166 --> 35:30.916
- Mom, an orgy?
- Yeah!

35:30.916 --> 35:32.041
[shouting] An orgy?

35:32.041 --> 35:33.333
- [Margie] Yes!
- Yep.

35:33.333 --> 35:34.958
I'm probably saying it wrong,

35:34.958 --> 35:38.541
but it's that thing where you go
and you just fuck everybody.

35:38.541 --> 35:42.208
- Oh, yeah, that's an orgy, all right.
- I had a lot of orgies.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.916
- [all laughing]
- That's where she met Dan Marino!

35:44.916 --> 35:46.916
- The football player?
- Yeah!

35:46.916 --> 35:49.458
Well, it was either there or JCPenney.

35:49.458 --> 35:53.041
Dan Marino doesn't shop at JCPenney.
He's a Hall of Famer.

35:53.041 --> 35:55.291
You met Dan Marino at the orgy.

35:55.291 --> 35:58.416
- Oh, Jesus Christ! So is Dad my dad?
- Of course I'm your dad!

35:58.416 --> 36:02.250
Don't be ridiculous! Why do you think
you have the Browning lower back hair?

36:02.250 --> 36:07.500
I've seen you play sports,
I know sure as shit it wasn't Dan Marino!

36:08.583 --> 36:10.208
- [Owen] Wait, what?
- [Neil] Dan Marino!

36:10.208 --> 36:12.500
- Here's to Danny boy.
- [Margie] Danny!

36:12.500 --> 36:15.041
- [all toasting]
- [Lilly] To Danny boy!

36:15.041 --> 36:18.791
Whoo! Touchdown! [laughing]

36:28.083 --> 36:32.000
Hey. Okay, look.
So here's me, here's my dad.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.083
The nose, the same beady,
little dead eyes.

36:35.083 --> 36:36.250
It's the same, right?

36:37.083 --> 36:40.500
- And the lower back hair.
- Sweetie, I've seen your back hair.

36:41.625 --> 36:44.333
Okay, of course,
but you haven't seen my dad's.

36:44.333 --> 36:47.833
- Should we FaceTime him?
- [laughs] No. Can we just talk for a sec?

36:50.791 --> 36:51.625
Yeah!

36:52.875 --> 36:53.875
Everything okay?

36:54.875 --> 36:56.125
What was that at dinner?

36:56.125 --> 37:00.041
Oh, I don't know, just the fact
that Dan Marino fucked my mom.

37:00.041 --> 37:03.291
Yeah, I... I know.
I know, and your bank got robbed.

37:03.291 --> 37:04.541
And he's a big man.

37:05.250 --> 37:07.416
He is. That's true. Um...

37:08.708 --> 37:12.875
Look, I know you've been through a lot,
and that's extremely traumatic,

37:12.875 --> 37:14.250
both things,

37:14.250 --> 37:16.625
but is there something else going on?

37:17.875 --> 37:19.916
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

37:20.500 --> 37:21.666
I won't get mad.

37:22.833 --> 37:23.666
[whispers] Okay?

37:24.250 --> 37:25.458
Okay, all right.

37:27.416 --> 37:29.375
- [doors close]
- [Owen] All right.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.333
So the reason I've been acting weird...

37:36.791 --> 37:38.291
I think your parents robbed my bank.

37:38.875 --> 37:40.541
[chuckling]

37:41.166 --> 37:42.666
[Parker laughs] What?

37:44.916 --> 37:46.833
- You're being serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious!

37:46.833 --> 37:49.583
- One of the robbers knew my name.
- It's on the bank website.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.666
But when I stepped on his heel,
he turned back,

37:51.666 --> 37:53.375
and he looked at me just like your dad.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.750
You said they had masks on.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.000
Yes, they were wearing masks,
but it was the same

37:57.000 --> 37:59.250
very specific disdain of me.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.833
It's a vibe thing, you know? And...

38:01.833 --> 38:05.875
And they knew that
"She left me roses by the stairs"

38:05.875 --> 38:07.875
was the voice activation code
to get in the vault,

38:07.875 --> 38:10.333
which I'm pretty sure
I told your mom about when I was wasted.

38:10.333 --> 38:13.125
Right, okay.
Well, does anyone else know the code?

38:13.708 --> 38:15.208
Just a couple-- Just-- Yeah.

38:15.208 --> 38:17.875
Tyree, Gary, Marisol.

38:18.666 --> 38:22.750
I think I told my therapist once,
but I don't think she listens to me.

38:23.375 --> 38:24.208
- Wow!
- Okay.

38:24.208 --> 38:26.416
You were the one
who said that they're a lot.

38:26.416 --> 38:30.458
I meant that they have big personalities,
not that they rob banks.

38:30.458 --> 38:32.708
[whispers] I'm not saying
that they are bank robbers!

38:32.708 --> 38:35.958
I'm saying that there's a possibility
that they're bank robbers.

38:35.958 --> 38:38.250
I'm just floating the idea out there.

38:38.250 --> 38:42.416
Well, now, I'm just floating the idea
that you've lost your fucking mind.

38:44.291 --> 38:47.291
- [intriguing music playing]
- [door opens]

38:57.875 --> 39:00.541
[Billy] I can't believe
we have to take this shit box.

39:04.541 --> 39:06.750
- [engine revving]
- Bank robbing son of a bitch!

39:08.375 --> 39:11.416
[Owen grunts in frustration]

39:14.416 --> 39:16.416
[suspenseful music playing]

39:17.958 --> 39:21.083
Oh, Jesus Christ, this thing moves.

39:27.416 --> 39:29.416
[tires squealing in distance]

39:31.666 --> 39:32.750
[horn honks loudly]

39:32.750 --> 39:34.125
Sor... Sorry!

39:35.583 --> 39:36.416
Sorry.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.541
[suspenseful music continues]

39:45.375 --> 39:47.583
- [cars honking loudly]
- [brakes screeching]

39:49.333 --> 39:51.250
- [honking continues]
- Okay, yep! Sorry!

39:52.041 --> 39:53.958
[cars honking]

39:53.958 --> 39:55.416
[Owen muttering]

39:56.250 --> 39:58.416
- [honking continues]
- [man] ...the fuck up!

39:58.416 --> 40:00.500
- [honking continues]
- [tires squealing]

40:01.208 --> 40:03.125
- [honking fades]
- [engine revving]

40:03.125 --> 40:04.375
Whoo!

40:05.041 --> 40:07.083
Okay. Oh, that was scary.

40:07.583 --> 40:09.583
[intriguing music playing]

40:17.833 --> 40:20.000
- Thank you, OnStar.
- [automated voice] <i>Happy to help.</i>

40:26.500 --> 40:30.125
The prodigal son has returned,
and bearing gifts.

40:31.583 --> 40:34.583
My God. You look like a snack.

40:35.750 --> 40:37.708
I could eat your dick
like corn on the cob.

40:41.625 --> 40:43.625
[intriguing music continues]

40:47.375 --> 40:49.875
Is this Scarface's house? God dang.

40:53.875 --> 40:54.708
Okay.

40:56.416 --> 40:57.666
[grunting]

40:57.666 --> 40:59.458
Ow! Come on!

41:01.458 --> 41:03.000
- [thump]
- [groans] Okay.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Now I know why rich people have these.

41:06.708 --> 41:09.333
- [squealing]
- [growling softly]

41:09.333 --> 41:11.833
[squealing and blowing]

41:13.875 --> 41:15.458
Can we get on with this?

41:15.458 --> 41:16.750
[chuckling]

41:16.750 --> 41:19.875
See, I just don't see
any reason why we can't be civil.

41:19.875 --> 41:22.541
Besides, if anyone
has a right to be angry, it's me.

41:22.541 --> 41:25.833
I was the one who was betrayed, right?

41:25.833 --> 41:28.125
[suspenseful music playing]

41:39.791 --> 41:41.416
- [dog growls]
- [exclaims]

41:41.416 --> 41:43.166
- [dog yelps]
- [loud thump]

41:43.166 --> 41:46.250
Oh! Oh, I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry, little buddy.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.125
[dogs growling and barking]

41:48.125 --> 41:50.416
No, no, no, no, no!

41:53.250 --> 41:55.166
There's just under a million in there.

41:57.041 --> 41:59.708
Bravo. Now you just owe me five more.

41:59.708 --> 42:01.375
- [dogs barking]
- [Owen] Oh, God!

42:01.375 --> 42:03.458
Mini ones? What, are they cheaper?

42:03.458 --> 42:06.000
We took one million, not six.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.333
And have you forgotten how this works?

42:08.333 --> 42:11.000
While you were running, so was the vig.

42:12.125 --> 42:15.041
- [dogs barking]
- I'm sorry I kicked your friend!

42:16.500 --> 42:18.958
- [Owen yelps]
- [barking continues]

42:19.750 --> 42:23.166
Oh, look at you little guys.
You guys are adorable from up here.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.708
If only you were a wee bit taller.

42:25.708 --> 42:28.791
- [branch snaps]
- [Owen] Ow! Why?

42:29.833 --> 42:32.208
Five million's gonna
take us some time, Rehan.

42:32.208 --> 42:34.583
Do I look like an unreasonable woman?

42:34.583 --> 42:36.541
No. You have till end of week.

42:37.208 --> 42:41.833
[grimacing] I'm sorry. Does that interfere
with your daughter's wedding?

42:43.458 --> 42:44.458
Oh, shit!

42:44.458 --> 42:47.208
Are you surprised that I am aware
that you have a daughter?

42:47.208 --> 42:48.291
And she...

42:48.291 --> 42:50.958
Let's hypothetically call her,
I don't know, Parker?

42:50.958 --> 42:53.291
...is getting married on Saturday.

42:53.791 --> 42:54.916
If you don't get me

42:54.916 --> 42:58.250
my five million dollars
before the wedding, then Parker...

42:59.166 --> 43:01.666
is marrying the Grim Reaper.

43:04.500 --> 43:07.416
- Meaning she'll be killed.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it.

43:07.416 --> 43:09.666
[Rehan] I know you got it, darling.

43:09.666 --> 43:12.708
Did I mention I have a new shark tank?

43:12.708 --> 43:15.833
Maybe your daughter
could test it out for me.

43:15.833 --> 43:17.583
[Rehan chuckling]

43:17.583 --> 43:19.875
Those fuckers are hungry.

43:20.458 --> 43:22.166
- [growling quietly]
- Shh!

43:25.291 --> 43:27.083
- [phone line ringing]
- Pick up, Parker!

43:27.083 --> 43:29.375
- Parker, pick up!
- [automated voice] <i>Thank you for--</i>

43:29.375 --> 43:30.625
- Son of a--
- [siren whoops]

43:30.625 --> 43:33.666
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!

43:34.291 --> 43:35.250
Oh, God!

43:36.458 --> 43:38.583
- Okay.
- [tense music playing]

43:41.375 --> 43:43.083
Hey, officer, how can I help you?

43:44.750 --> 43:46.958
License and masturbation, please.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.291
- Okay, good morning.
- [laughing] You look like shit.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.416
And that's coming from a guy

43:52.416 --> 43:54.791
who uses his sock
as a filter for his coffee.

43:54.791 --> 43:55.916
No, I'm doing great.

43:55.916 --> 43:57.500
- Thanks for asking.
- Mmm.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.666
There appears to be
a dog gnawing on your leg.

44:00.666 --> 44:01.958
[growling]

44:02.500 --> 44:06.416
Yeah, that's just my little buddy.
My little bud.

44:06.416 --> 44:08.708
We just took a walk in the woods.

44:08.708 --> 44:10.083
You know, it's funny,

44:10.875 --> 44:12.833
the Ghost Bandits knew precisely

44:12.833 --> 44:16.000
how to circumvent
the security system in your bank.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.750
And when I called SunRidge
to find out who designed the system,

44:20.916 --> 44:22.333
you know what they said?

44:23.333 --> 44:26.666
[scoffs] Are you insinuating
that I had something to do with it?

44:27.666 --> 44:29.083
Do you mind popping the trunk?

44:29.875 --> 44:31.541
- Pop the trunk.
- Okay, this is insane.

44:31.541 --> 44:34.208
I'll say that. I mean, this is ridiculous.

44:34.208 --> 44:36.500
I haven't committed a crime
in my entire life.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.125
[Oldham] Uh-huh.

44:38.125 --> 44:39.750
First time for everything!

44:40.541 --> 44:42.500
- [metal door slams]
- [Oldham] Let's see.

44:42.500 --> 44:44.375
We got a couple burner phones,

44:44.375 --> 44:46.833
two boxes of nine mil, and...

44:47.625 --> 44:49.625
[distorted] ...voice modulator.

44:49.625 --> 44:51.416
Someone put this stuff in my trunk.

44:51.416 --> 44:53.833
[distorted] Who, Owen?
Who are you working with?

44:53.833 --> 44:56.041
[growling]

44:56.041 --> 44:57.958
- [distorted] Who, Owen?
- I...

44:58.958 --> 45:00.416
I don't... I don't know.

45:00.416 --> 45:05.083
Okay, look, I get it.
I forget things too sometimes.

45:05.083 --> 45:10.416
So how about a nice, long weekend
in a jail cell to help jog your memory?

45:10.416 --> 45:12.625
I'm...
I'm supposed to get married this weekend.

45:12.625 --> 45:16.416
You know, I was married once,
to a beautiful woman named Sheryl.

45:17.625 --> 45:20.000
- You know where she is now?
- Is she dead?

45:21.041 --> 45:22.125
I wish.

45:22.833 --> 45:25.916
No, she lives in Key West
with her new husband.

45:25.916 --> 45:27.750
Former Navy SEAL.

45:27.750 --> 45:31.625
Rock-hard abs,
and a cock you can land a 747 on.

45:31.625 --> 45:32.958
That's a big plane.

45:32.958 --> 45:34.750
It's a wide plane.

45:35.583 --> 45:39.833
Anyway, I became so obsessed
with catching the Ghost Bandits

45:39.833 --> 45:42.125
that it cost me my marriage.

45:42.125 --> 45:43.041
Hmm?

45:43.541 --> 45:44.583
My house.

45:45.666 --> 45:47.125
Maybe even my sanity.

45:47.125 --> 45:50.458
I mean, after a while,
I started wondering if the Ghost Bandits...

45:51.541 --> 45:53.791
you know, were real ghosts.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.666
Hey! Let's funnel this energy
into getting Sheryl back!

46:00.416 --> 46:02.833
Right? I can make a photo montage.

46:02.833 --> 46:05.958
Don't let this guy
with this giant cock win over you!

46:05.958 --> 46:08.625
- [sighs] Lock him up.
- Wait, no! My wedding!

46:08.625 --> 46:10.583
Oh, you're gonna have a wedding,

46:10.583 --> 46:13.875
and quite the bachelor party
in D block this weekend.

46:16.125 --> 46:16.958
It wasn't me.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.333
It was my in-laws.

46:21.333 --> 46:23.666
They robbed my bank,
and I did not help them.

46:23.666 --> 46:24.583
They used me.

46:25.166 --> 46:26.666
Damn, boy, you flip quick.

46:27.416 --> 46:30.250
Prove it.
Put on a wire and get 'em to confess.

46:30.833 --> 46:34.416
- You want me to be a rat?
- I want you to do the right thing, Owen.

46:35.208 --> 46:38.916
Clear your name,
and help me catch the Ghost Bandits.

46:40.125 --> 46:42.625
And also, yes, be a little bit of a rat.

46:43.125 --> 46:45.333
[menacing music playing]

46:46.500 --> 46:47.500
[whispers] Parker.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.583
- [door closes]
- [whispers] Parker! Hey, Parker!

46:51.333 --> 46:53.541
- [Parker] There you are! Where you been?
- We have to talk.

46:53.541 --> 46:55.833
- Why are you pinching your chest?
- Because I'm wearing a--

46:55.833 --> 46:59.083
[nervously] Whoa, gosh!
A... soft shirt! Whoa!

46:59.083 --> 47:01.291
Feels like my fingers are at a finger spa.

47:01.291 --> 47:03.208
- Really? Looks pretty starchy--
- Don't touch me!

47:05.333 --> 47:07.000
I'm sorry. It's just...

47:07.958 --> 47:10.916
the in-laws aren't supposed
to touch the groom before the wedding.

47:10.916 --> 47:13.166
- That's horseshit.
- Are you high right now, Owen?

47:13.166 --> 47:15.500
I don't do illegal things,
unlike other people.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.666
Other people do... illegal things,
and I'm cool with that too.

47:18.666 --> 47:21.791
And if we want to talk about that
and just sort of get things off our chest...

47:21.791 --> 47:25.083
Okay, uh, we gotta go,
'cause we gotta be at the bakery.

47:26.083 --> 47:27.750
The bakery! Yep!

47:27.750 --> 47:30.041
Okay, I think me and you
should just go to the bakery,

47:30.041 --> 47:33.000
just because our baker died,
we gotta get a new cake.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.375
Perhaps we should all just go together.
One big happy family.

47:37.125 --> 47:39.000
You guys don't wanna run errands.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
I do.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.333
Of course we do.
Who doesn't like desserts?

47:42.333 --> 47:47.083
Well, they're vegan desserts,
and we all know that they taste like shit.

47:47.666 --> 47:50.125
I'm sorry, Parker,
but I'm being honest with you.

47:50.125 --> 47:52.583
They taste like shit, okay?

47:52.583 --> 47:56.000
So you guys should stay,
we should go eat the shit. Come on.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.750
[Parker on mic] <i>As long as we leave now.</i>

47:57.750 --> 48:01.000
[Owen] <i>Oh, we're all going. Cool, good.
All right! Okay!</i>

48:01.000 --> 48:06.750
[singsong] Okay! Oh, we're tasting cakes
at 1308 Grant Avenue!

48:06.750 --> 48:09.083
You know, when I go on a trip,
I usually take two bags.

48:09.083 --> 48:10.833
I have a carry-on, then I check one too.

48:10.833 --> 48:13.291
- [on mic] <i>I check one, two.</i>
- Schmuck.

48:13.291 --> 48:16.541
[Owen] <i>You're driving!
Billy McDermott is driving! Cool.</i>

48:18.416 --> 48:20.833
<i>Hey, do you want to play
Never Have I Ever?</i>

48:20.833 --> 48:24.000
<i>Never have I ever worn
a scary mask when it wasn't Halloween.</i>

48:24.000 --> 48:25.125
<i>Now your turn.</i>

48:26.916 --> 48:30.291
[Owen] <i>We have arrived.
I am one click south of the door.</i>

48:30.291 --> 48:33.625
<i>You guys sure you don't wanna wait
in the car? No? Okay.</i>

48:33.625 --> 48:35.166
<i>We are zero clicks from the door.</i>

48:35.166 --> 48:37.458
<i>- I am opening the door.</i>
- [bell ringing]

48:37.458 --> 48:40.416
- [Owen] Right this way, come on in.
- [Billy] Go ahead. Smells good.

48:40.416 --> 48:42.958
Nice. Yep, that's cake.

48:42.958 --> 48:45.791
Welcome to Vegan Divas.
Where you can get your cake--

48:45.791 --> 48:49.083
- [door opens loudly]
- And eat it too! I'm Kay.

48:49.083 --> 48:50.750
And this is my sister Ida.

48:50.750 --> 48:55.250
She's the vegan and I'm the diva.

48:56.416 --> 48:59.500
Thank you so much
for fitting us in last minute.

48:59.500 --> 49:01.041
- Yep.
- Don't even worry about it.

49:01.041 --> 49:04.416
I totally get last minute.
I'm never on time for anything.

49:04.416 --> 49:06.666
Are you sure about this? [laughs]

49:06.666 --> 49:08.666
[whispers] Our wedding
is at a very specific time.

49:08.666 --> 49:10.291
No, it's okay. The reviews were great.

49:10.291 --> 49:11.916
- This is just their shtick.
- [head bangs]

49:11.916 --> 49:12.958
[Billy] Oh!

49:13.541 --> 49:15.125
[Kay on mic] <i>Why do I keep doing that?</i>

49:15.125 --> 49:16.791
[Ida] <i>Hey, I think you might be bleeding.</i>

49:16.791 --> 49:18.208
- [Kay] <i>Ida!</i>
- [Ida] <i>Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

49:18.208 --> 49:20.125
- [Kay] <i>Cake! Hurry!</i>
- [Ida] <i>Okay.</i>

49:22.458 --> 49:25.416
So this is our Better-Than-Sex
red velvet cake

49:25.416 --> 49:27.041
that Ida makes from scratch.

49:27.041 --> 49:29.208
And that name is no lie.

49:29.208 --> 49:30.708
I've compared them both.

49:30.708 --> 49:32.125
Mmm! And this is vegan?

49:33.291 --> 49:34.166
Oh, yeah.

49:34.166 --> 49:35.250
Hmm.

49:35.833 --> 49:38.791
[softly] Parker, can I speak with you
in private real quick?

49:39.375 --> 49:40.375
What's wrong?

49:40.375 --> 49:42.125
- I like to concur...
- What? Sure.

49:42.125 --> 49:45.333
...about, you know, important life decisions
before we make them.

49:45.333 --> 49:47.208
- You know? Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

49:54.541 --> 49:56.916
- You have a little something here.
- What's that, sweetheart?

49:56.916 --> 49:58.833
What the fuck?

49:59.583 --> 50:02.416
I'm sorry!
I didn't know you guys were together!

50:02.416 --> 50:04.125
[laughs] Owen, what's going on?

50:04.125 --> 50:07.750
Okay, I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but the FBI thinks

50:07.750 --> 50:10.041
- I had something to do with the robbery.
- What?

50:10.041 --> 50:11.416
- They made me wear--
- [doors open]

50:11.416 --> 50:13.875
Oh! What a lovely little bakery.

50:13.875 --> 50:16.333
- You must be Parker!
- Hi.

50:16.333 --> 50:18.625
- [Parker yelps]
- [all clamoring]

50:18.625 --> 50:22.166
- [loudly] Ah! Nobody make a scene!
- You're the one with the gun, Rehan.

50:22.166 --> 50:25.708
Yes, you are the one with the gun
holding hostages right now...

50:25.708 --> 50:28.166
- [on mic] <i>...inside of the bakery.</i>
- [gags] Oh, hostages!

50:29.583 --> 50:32.083
- What the hell is going on?
- Listen, Rehan.

50:32.083 --> 50:34.875
- We told you we'd get you the money.
- Oh, yes. No, you did.

50:34.875 --> 50:36.708
But then I remembered you are liars.

50:36.708 --> 50:39.958
Just in case you were planning
on slithering away into the shadows again,

50:39.958 --> 50:41.916
I thought I'd come here for a little...

50:42.625 --> 50:44.666
- insurance.
- [Parker yelps]

50:44.666 --> 50:46.166
[laughing]

50:48.458 --> 50:51.875
- [Rehan] Come along, Parker.
- Hey, hey, hey! Just take me instead.

50:51.875 --> 50:52.916
Take me!

50:52.916 --> 50:55.916
You little Build-A-Bear?
You think you're hostage material?

50:55.916 --> 50:58.708
No one here gives two shits
whether you live or die!

50:58.708 --> 51:01.708
Look at them and check in with them.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.250
Oh! Zero shits given.

51:04.833 --> 51:07.166
I don't understand. Was Owen right?

51:07.166 --> 51:08.875
Just do what she says.

51:08.875 --> 51:11.958
Stay calm, baby. Just stay calm.

51:11.958 --> 51:15.166
So emo! Getting choked up.

51:15.166 --> 51:17.666
- Dad? Dad?
- I like getting choked, though.

51:17.666 --> 51:20.041
You can eat my cake anytime!

51:20.041 --> 51:23.916
Please, God, save my fiancée who is
exiting the back of the bakery right now.

51:23.916 --> 51:25.958
FBI! Freeze!

51:25.958 --> 51:27.375
God'll save you, Parker!

51:27.375 --> 51:29.875
[dramatic music playing]

51:29.875 --> 51:33.000
[music building and stops]

51:35.666 --> 51:40.041
[whining loudly] Please!
God, please! Please! Please, God!

51:43.583 --> 51:46.166
- [epic music playing]
- [guns firing]

51:46.166 --> 51:48.458
Ahh! Oh! Oh, shit!

51:48.458 --> 51:50.791
- [all clamoring]
- [gunfire continues]

51:53.208 --> 51:56.958
Come on, Roger! You got this, Roger!
Be a man, you dickhead!

51:56.958 --> 52:00.166
- [glass shattering]
- [gunfire continues]

52:02.791 --> 52:04.458
Ahh! Ahh!

52:06.083 --> 52:08.166
[gunfire continues]

52:20.916 --> 52:21.791
[exclaiming]

52:23.833 --> 52:25.833
- [whining]
- [gunfire continues]

52:27.375 --> 52:30.583
[both shrieking]

52:31.541 --> 52:33.791
- [shrieking continues on mic]
- God, man!

52:35.458 --> 52:37.666
- [Parker] Fuck you!
- [Rehan] Go on, take her!

52:37.666 --> 52:39.458
Get the fuck in! Get in the car!

52:40.291 --> 52:42.708
[epic music continues]

52:43.291 --> 52:44.625
I'm going after her.

52:44.625 --> 52:47.083
What the fuck? Oh, son of a bitch.

52:48.791 --> 52:50.375
Everything's fucking cake in here!

52:51.166 --> 52:52.375
I'm going after her!

52:52.375 --> 52:55.041
No! You're gonna get yourself killed!
Get down! Get down!

53:01.208 --> 53:03.166
You're really fuckin' getting on my tits!

53:03.166 --> 53:06.041
- [music building]
- [shrieking]

53:07.041 --> 53:09.166
- [music stops]
- Shut up!

53:11.666 --> 53:13.833
Lilly! Lilly, the front!

53:13.833 --> 53:14.750
Let's go.

53:14.750 --> 53:17.750
[dramatic music playing]

53:21.666 --> 53:22.750
Go for the tires.

53:23.291 --> 53:24.958
[Rehan] Get me my fucking money!

53:25.958 --> 53:27.166
Ah, shit.

53:27.166 --> 53:29.208
I fucking love this job!

53:29.791 --> 53:31.583
- [loud bang]
- [Rehan] Motherfuckers!

53:31.583 --> 53:32.666
[Oldham] Freeze!

53:33.625 --> 53:34.458
[Billy] What?

53:34.458 --> 53:35.875
Put your guns down.

53:35.875 --> 53:37.000
Put 'em down now.

53:38.666 --> 53:40.500
- They got our daughter.
- Don't move!

53:40.500 --> 53:43.458
[screaming]

53:49.791 --> 53:52.333
- [Billy] Motherfucker!
- [groaning]

53:53.375 --> 53:56.166
You! You were supposed to protect her!

53:56.166 --> 53:58.583
This is why people
don't trust the federal government.

53:58.583 --> 54:00.625
This is on you! Hey! Hey!

54:00.625 --> 54:02.625
Let me in! Hey, let me in!

54:03.208 --> 54:04.625
No, no, no, no, no!

54:04.625 --> 54:05.916
Let me in! Let me in!

54:05.916 --> 54:08.541
- Okay, I committed. [grunting]
- [engine revving]

54:12.333 --> 54:14.333
[Owen screaming faintly]

54:16.500 --> 54:20.958
[Owen screaming loudly]

54:22.333 --> 54:23.333
What happened?

54:24.291 --> 54:25.833
[grunting] Ahh!

54:26.833 --> 54:28.541
- [Billy] Oh, Jesus.
- [Owen] Ow!

54:28.541 --> 54:31.541
[Billy] Come on, get your ass out here.
There you go.

54:31.541 --> 54:34.583
Ahh! Why are we stopped?
We gotta go after her!

54:35.166 --> 54:37.958
- I know where that woman lives!
- Rehan has houses everywhere.

54:37.958 --> 54:39.625
We have no idea where she took Parker.

54:39.625 --> 54:41.666
[Billy] Even if you did,
what were you gonna do?

54:41.666 --> 54:42.916
Sneak into the bushes

54:42.916 --> 54:45.375
and get chased up a tree
by a pack of tiny dogs?

54:45.375 --> 54:47.500
Parker is in the wind.

54:48.125 --> 54:50.291
- I'm sorry.
- Well, what are we gonna do now?

54:50.291 --> 54:53.416
The first thing we're gonna do is
you're gonna take that fucking wire off.

54:53.416 --> 54:54.708
[Billy] You little shit bag.

54:54.708 --> 54:57.541
I knew you were a coward
but I didn't take you to be a rat.

54:57.541 --> 55:00.041
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm not
gonna take the fall for you guys!

55:00.041 --> 55:01.541
We never asked you to.

55:01.541 --> 55:03.750
No! You just framed me!

55:03.750 --> 55:06.833
You put bank-robbing evidence
in the trunk of my car!

55:08.125 --> 55:09.791
He wouldn't have
been convicted of anything!

55:09.791 --> 55:11.583
It was just enough to tie him up

55:11.583 --> 55:14.750
and save Parker from making
the biggest mistake of her life.

55:15.333 --> 55:18.666
[yelling] She just got kidnapped
because of you!

55:19.791 --> 55:23.125
Before you came back in her life,
the worst thing that happened to Parker?

55:23.625 --> 55:26.166
She burned the roof of her mouth
on a home-made flatbread.

55:26.166 --> 55:29.291
I would've blown on it, but I couldn't.
I had a cold.

55:29.291 --> 55:33.333
How could you guys
possibly know what she wants?

55:33.333 --> 55:35.208
Or needs? You weren't there!

55:35.208 --> 55:38.125
Because we were trying
to fucking protect her, that's why!

55:38.125 --> 55:39.625
Rehan used to be our partner.

55:39.625 --> 55:41.458
She would choose the bank
and clean the money.

55:41.458 --> 55:43.333
And then she started to fuckin' lose it!

55:43.333 --> 55:46.041
We were afraid
she would find out about Parker.

55:46.041 --> 55:48.750
So on the last job,
we just took the money and ran.

55:48.750 --> 55:51.166
I don't give a shit.
I don't care what happened, okay?

55:51.666 --> 55:54.583
- I just care about getting Parker back.
- Oh, yeah, you and me both.

55:57.083 --> 56:01.291
You need five million in two days.
So you're gonna rob another bank, right?

56:02.583 --> 56:04.708
Wouldn't hurt to have
a bank manager on the team.

56:06.375 --> 56:10.500
Someone who knows the bank's weaknesses,
which ones have excess cash holdings,

56:10.500 --> 56:12.500
when and where they move that cash.

56:13.041 --> 56:15.916
He gets nervous cracking an egg.
You think he can rob a bank?

56:15.916 --> 56:19.541
If it's to save Parker?
Fuck yeah, I'll rob a bank!

56:23.041 --> 56:23.875
[sighs softly]

56:24.583 --> 56:26.625
We always knew they were criminals.

56:27.208 --> 56:29.083
[whispers] They drink during the day.

56:29.083 --> 56:33.416
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, and the daughter...
is a yoga instructor.

56:33.416 --> 56:36.333
I'm not saying anything,
but, you know, connect the dots.

56:36.333 --> 56:37.416
[Oldham] Mmm.

56:38.375 --> 56:40.250
Do you have any idea
where they might've gone?

56:40.250 --> 56:41.333
[Neil] Mmm-mmm.

56:41.333 --> 56:45.041
Does Owen have any access
to a family cabin or anything like that?

56:45.041 --> 56:47.000
A, um, a vacation home--

56:47.000 --> 56:49.375
Vacation home? What, are you kidding me?

56:49.875 --> 56:51.833
Who do we look like, The Jeffersons?

56:52.708 --> 56:54.083
[sighs heavily]

56:54.791 --> 56:57.666
Here's a list of all the banks
within a 100-mile radius,

56:57.666 --> 57:02.041
arranged by on-site cash holdings,
from ValueBank all the way up to--

57:02.041 --> 57:04.500
Atlas Reserve, 20 million dollars.

57:04.500 --> 57:06.833
- One-stop shopping.
- Hmm! Easy.

57:06.833 --> 57:08.458
[laughing] Yeah, I wish!

57:08.458 --> 57:09.375
- [Billy] No?
- No.

57:09.375 --> 57:11.083
We can't rob Atlas Reserve.

57:11.083 --> 57:13.541
Phoebe King has that place on lock.

57:13.541 --> 57:14.708
Who's Phoebe King?

57:14.708 --> 57:18.250
I thought you guys were the Ghost Bandits.
You don't know who Phoebe King is?

57:18.958 --> 57:22.166
<i>- She pioneered bandit barriers.</i>
- [upbeat music playing]

57:22.833 --> 57:25.416
[Owen] <i>Every inch of her bank
is triple secured.</i>

57:25.416 --> 57:26.833
I'd fuck me.

57:26.833 --> 57:28.083
And her vault?

57:28.083 --> 57:31.500
<i>I'm talking biometrics,
weight sensitivity,</i>

57:31.500 --> 57:34.166
not to mention randomized time locks!

57:34.166 --> 57:35.583
[laughing] Okay?

57:36.375 --> 57:37.541
When did you make this?

57:38.041 --> 57:40.166
When I walked to the vending machine,
got a Diet Squirt.

57:40.166 --> 57:42.041
Weirdly, I had a lot of it in my pockets.

57:42.041 --> 57:43.250
So, let me get this straight.

57:43.250 --> 57:45.458
You made a model
of a bank we're not gonna rob?

57:47.333 --> 57:49.541
Oh, wow. There's another one.
He made two.

57:49.541 --> 57:51.625
I made 12. Only two are presentable.

57:51.625 --> 57:53.375
See, we don't want a Phoebe King.

57:53.375 --> 57:57.000
What we need is Victory Union,
a bank whose manager is lazy.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.125
A total turd.

57:59.666 --> 58:03.583
- What we need is a Vince Millen.
- [upbeat music continues]

58:04.250 --> 58:06.583
Vince lost his right testicle because,
one time,

58:06.583 --> 58:08.875
he sat on his nuts too hard.

58:08.875 --> 58:10.333
[screaming]

58:10.333 --> 58:12.833
[Owen] <i>The reason he got hired
is 'cause his dad owns the bank.</i>

58:12.833 --> 58:13.750
[man] Okay.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.666
[Owen] <i>The most important thing
about Vince is that he cuts corners.</i>

58:18.666 --> 58:20.083
Federal regulations limit

58:20.083 --> 58:23.208
how much cash a branch can hold
for security and insurance purposes.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.750
<i>When you go over the limit,</i>

58:24.750 --> 58:27.625
<i>a manager has to arrange
for a cash pick-up from the vault.</i>

58:27.625 --> 58:29.458
[Vince] Yo, lock up for me.
I got paintball.

58:30.375 --> 58:34.541
Now, the armored truck is supposed to
take the cash directly to the repository,

58:34.541 --> 58:36.666
but Vince hates paperwork.

58:38.083 --> 58:40.166
So he has the same armored truck

58:40.166 --> 58:42.875
collect cash
from all three branches he manages

58:42.875 --> 58:45.208
before going to the repository.

58:45.208 --> 58:48.958
So if we hit that truck
after the pickup from the third branch...

58:48.958 --> 58:51.625
- It's like robbing three banks in one.
- [Owen claps]

58:51.625 --> 58:53.541
- We just need disguises.
- [Owen] Yep.

58:53.541 --> 58:54.708
And I need a gun.

58:56.041 --> 58:57.875
- What? Oh, my gosh.
- Mmm-hmm.

58:57.875 --> 58:59.583
Whoa!

58:59.583 --> 59:00.583
[laughs]

59:00.583 --> 59:03.833
- It's way lighter than I thought it'd be.
- It's a water gun.

59:05.458 --> 59:06.583
- Is it?
- Mmm-hmm.

59:07.666 --> 59:08.916
Do I still look cool?

59:09.833 --> 59:11.875
Yeah, you look like James Bond.

59:11.875 --> 59:13.000
Which one?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.083
- Five.
- Oh, that was a good one.

59:15.083 --> 59:17.333
[expectant music playing]

59:46.833 --> 59:48.833
[expectant music continues]

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.333
- [gun firing]
- [crowd shrieking]

01:00:11.291 --> 01:00:12.958
Everybody on the ground, now!

01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:14.625
- Don't be a hero!
- [vault door opens]

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.000
Hey, Donkey!

01:00:22.666 --> 01:00:23.750
[groaning]

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.291
Oh, God! That was really violent!

01:00:26.916 --> 01:00:29.458
How'd you like my accent?
Did it sound Irish or Scottish?

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:32.166
It was supposed to sound Scottish
but I think it came out Irish.

01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:33.208
Don't tell Billy.

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:35.250
[Lilly] Focus! We're robbing a bank here.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:38.625
And remember, you're in charge.

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:40.541
[dramatic music playing]

01:00:42.166 --> 01:00:44.208
That's right! I'm in charge, okay?

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.958
So no one try to be a hero.

01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:49.000
I will cap a motherfucker!

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.916
I will cap your ass!

01:00:50.916 --> 01:00:52.958
[dramatic music continues]

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:05.000
Everybody, stay down, all right?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.791
You guys like <i>Shrek?</i>
Who's your favorite character?

01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:09.125
Mine's Shrek.

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:13.041
What are you doing? Don't get up.
Do not get up!

01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:16.208
[nervously] Okay, and you did.
But stay right there, all right?

01:01:16.208 --> 01:01:20.083
Do not come towards me.
Do not come tow-- Don't rush towards me!

01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:22.250
- [Owen shrieking]
- [people screaming]

01:01:22.958 --> 01:01:24.750
[suspenseful music playing]

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.000
Easy breezy.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.291
- [phone keypad clicking]
- [suspenseful music continues]

01:01:32.291 --> 01:01:33.166
Ahh!

01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:37.041
- [man yelling]
- [crowd gasps]

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.375
What the fuck?

01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:48.583
Freeze!

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:51.083
Nice and easy, boy-o. I gotcha.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.583
[groaning]

01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:57.666
Put the gun down. Put it down.

01:01:57.666 --> 01:01:59.000
That's very good.

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:03.875
[thrilling music playing]

01:02:03.875 --> 01:02:05.750
[shrieking]

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:14.625
Lilly! I got this, get the money!

01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:16.166
[shrieking]

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:24.833
[groans]

01:02:24.833 --> 01:02:27.583
[thrilling music continues]

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:29.208
[shrieking]

01:02:30.208 --> 01:02:33.333
[coughs and wheezes]

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.416
[Owen grunts]

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:39.000
[thrilling music continues]

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.750
[Lilly] Billy!

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.958
[tense music playing]

01:02:48.875 --> 01:02:51.583
[Lilly] Come on, kid,
where the fuck are you?

01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:53.500
[grunting]

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:56.791
[man coughing]

01:02:57.708 --> 01:03:00.375
- [coughing continues]
- [crowd exclaiming and clapping]

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:08.750
[Billy] About time, Shrek.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.708
Sorry, a big guy that looked like
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's character

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:14.791
from <i>Moana</i> had a heart attack,
so I had to give him CPR.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:15.958
How's your part going?

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:18.875
- [Lilly] Three against two. Drop 'em.
- [guard] What do we do?

01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:20.625
- I don't know.
- You drop 'em.

01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.916
Can we hurry up?
[yells] Can we hurry this up?

01:03:29.916 --> 01:03:32.500
Okay, all right, just put 'em down.

01:03:33.416 --> 01:03:34.583
Easy down now.

01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:38.083
[water dripping]

01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:39.500
What the fuck?

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:42.333
- Oh, shit.
- [Lilly] Son of a bitch!

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.750
- [Owen shrieking]
- [bullets ricocheting]

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:46.916
Oh! Oh, God!

01:03:46.916 --> 01:03:48.583
[guns firing]

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:52.166
That boy's a real dumbass.

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:53.708
[whimpering]

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.916
- [Lilly] Fuck, there goes our getaway.
- Okay.

01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:08.166
- [tires screeching]
- [guards grunting]

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.041
- [rock music playing]
- Get in!

01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:13.666
Go! Go, go, go!

01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:16.916
All right, yeah! We're doing this.

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.166
Shut up and drive!

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.666
Okay, yeah, let's go.

01:04:19.666 --> 01:04:21.708
[rock music continues]

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.500
You know, I always wanted
to be a school bus driver.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:34.666
The money!

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:36.625
The money, the money!

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.416
Oh, no, no, no. That's not good.

01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:42.916
[Billy] I'm gonna
kick your green ass, Shrek!

01:04:42.916 --> 01:04:44.791
[sirens blaring]

01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:50.625
I thought we defunded the police.

01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:53.708
- [rock music continues]
- [sirens blaring]

01:04:58.666 --> 01:05:00.625
[officer on loudspeaker] <i>Pull over now!</i>

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:05.541
[Owen] I'm sorry!

01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:06.541
Yep, now they're angry.

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:09.291
- [gun firing]
- [bullets ricocheting]

01:05:10.375 --> 01:05:12.000
[shrieking]

01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:14.291
[Owen] Oh, God!

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.000
He'll be fine, it's fine.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:33.666
[Lilly] Where the fuck is he going?

01:05:36.375 --> 01:05:39.666
[rock music continues]

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.375
- [Lilly screaming]
- [Owen] Oh, my God!

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:51.041
Lord forgive us, Mary and Joseph!

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:03.041
[priest] ...to light, as our hearts
mourn during this time--

01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:06.125
- [bystanders screaming]
- [rock music continues]

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:10.000
Goal! [chuckles]

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.833
Have you no dignity?

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:13.541
[rock music continues]

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:27.875
Ho-ho-ho!

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:30.416
Pretty sure my great-grandma
was buried in here.

01:06:30.416 --> 01:06:32.375
Shut the fuck up!

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:33.375
[Owen] Okay.

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:35.833
Oh, shit.

01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:39.291
Why?

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:46.125
- Oh, shit!
- [alarm chiming]

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:47.583
- [Owen] God.
- What the fuck is that?

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:51.250
My Go-Gurts! Snack time.
Gotta keep the blood sugar up.

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:53.250
- [Lilly] Give me that.
- You want to pick a flavor?

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:55.458
- [Lilly] Fucking Go-Gurts!
- [Billy] Snack time!

01:06:56.583 --> 01:06:58.541
- [officer] Shit!
- [exclaiming]

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:03.083
[rock music fading]

01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:08.708
[Billy] Oh, shit.

01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:12.333
[sighs]

01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:15.208
[Owen] How much did we clear?

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.458
Sixty bucks.

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:23.083
Sixty bucks.

01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:25.583
Okay, that's a building block.

01:07:29.416 --> 01:07:31.416
[upbeat music fading in]

01:07:37.125 --> 01:07:39.000
[upbeat music playing]

01:07:42.583 --> 01:07:44.625
I'm sorry. What the fuck is this?

01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:47.958
You don't know him? This is Babayan.

01:07:47.958 --> 01:07:52.000
He's like the Kanye
of the former Soviet Bloc.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.041
Is the Kanye here?

01:07:53.041 --> 01:07:55.458
Shut the fuck up and dance!

01:07:57.666 --> 01:07:59.833
Do my parents rob banks?

01:07:59.833 --> 01:08:01.458
Do I have a magical pussy?

01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.541
The answer is yes.

01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:07.166
Your parents,
they are magnificent bank robbers.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.833
I mean, when they disappeared, I felt...

01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:11.666
betrayed.

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.291
[Rehan] You try to run?

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:16.041
Ahh!

01:08:16.041 --> 01:08:17.458
[Rehan] Stupid bitch.

01:08:17.458 --> 01:08:18.958
Now, pay attention.

01:08:18.958 --> 01:08:22.250
Babayan is about to do his grand finale.

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.208
- [upbeat music continues]
- [Rehan] Hoorah, Babayan!

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.916
Hoorah, Babayan!

01:08:33.666 --> 01:08:35.958
- [explosion]
- [Owen exclaiming]

01:08:37.458 --> 01:08:39.250
I think I left my phone in there.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:41.458
Okay, guess Uber's out of the question.

01:08:42.666 --> 01:08:44.166
CPR?

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:48.000
You stopped to give someone CPR?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
- My training kicked in.
- You foolish gobshite!

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.125
Okay, stop it! We have less
than 24 hours to get that money.

01:08:55.125 --> 01:08:56.958
Oh, forget about the money.

01:08:56.958 --> 01:08:59.708
We need to rescue Parker first,
then leave the country.

01:08:59.708 --> 01:09:02.125
We are not running this time.

01:09:02.125 --> 01:09:04.458
Parker made a real life for herself here.

01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:07.750
- It's what's best for her.
- No, that's what's best for us.

01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:12.875
I... I have an idea.

01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:17.083
We could rob Atlas Reserve.

01:09:17.083 --> 01:09:20.791
What happened to,
"One does not rob Phoebe King?"

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.625
One doesn't, but maybe three does?

01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:27.750
I don't know. I just-- I know a way in.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:30.875
I just don't know we could get out
once the police show up.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:33.458
Well, maybe we can
get a little help there.

01:09:36.458 --> 01:09:38.166
Ghost Bandits on three.

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:39.083
Three...

01:09:40.916 --> 01:09:43.416
Okay, that was gonna be a cool moment.
Hey, guys, wait up!

01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:48.958
<i>Earlier today, a man dressed
as the popular animated character Shrek</i>

01:09:48.958 --> 01:09:53.625
<i>attempted to rob Victory Union Bank,
but he soon discovered that it's not so...</i>

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:58.125
That's 100% Owen in a Shrek costume.
I could recognize his giant ass anywhere.

01:09:58.125 --> 01:10:00.125
- No, it's not.
- It's not.

01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:01.375
Damn, he's going nuts.

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:03.041
Why is he on TV?

01:10:03.041 --> 01:10:04.625
I'm gonna call him again.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:06.166
[phone ringing]

01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:08.541
- Hello?
- It's Billy.

01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:09.708
Oh, it's Billy.

01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:11.708
- Okay--
- You listen to me.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.541
You touch one single hair
on my son's back, and I swear to God--

01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:17.458
Shut up and listen,
I'm not gonna touch your son's back hair.

01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:19.541
But I am gonna use him to rob a bank.

01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:23.166
If you don't want to see him go to prison,
we're gonna need getaway drivers.

01:10:23.166 --> 01:10:26.708
Wait, hold on!
You want us to be getaway drivers?

01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:29.375
So be at Owen's bank tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:32.791
- And keep the engine running!
- [whispers] Let me talk! Let me talk!

01:10:32.791 --> 01:10:36.083
[crying] Mom? Dad?
I'm so scared! I'm so scared! Please...

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:37.958
Please, if you love me at all,

01:10:37.958 --> 01:10:40.791
don't tell Agent Oldham
at the FBI anything.

01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:42.625
Honey, I swear.

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:44.416
We will tell no one!

01:10:44.916 --> 01:10:46.041
No one!

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.000
[intriguing music playing]

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.750
- What time did they say?
- 10:00 a.m.

01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:57.333
Why does your clock say 8:00?

01:10:58.125 --> 01:11:01.500
Oh, I took a business trip
to Phoenix once, I never changed it back.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.166
Something's not right here.

01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:07.208
[suspenseful music playing]

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.166
[Owen] Good. Coast is clear.

01:11:13.916 --> 01:11:16.375
Told you they wouldn't
be an accessory to a crime.

01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:18.333
Owen, you better take this.

01:11:20.666 --> 01:11:22.416
Whoa, heft.

01:11:22.416 --> 01:11:24.833
That's not tap water. It's lead.

01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:27.208
Do not under any circumstances--

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:28.250
Oh, Jesus.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.208
Do not pull the trigger.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
[exhales heavily]

01:11:33.833 --> 01:11:36.250
All right. Game time.

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:38.791
Await my signal.

01:11:42.416 --> 01:11:45.500
Just think of how many
terrible decisions we had to make

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.250
to get to this moment in time,

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:50.291
with everything riding
on this pasty little goober.

01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:53.416
We're so fucked.

01:11:53.416 --> 01:11:55.416
Yeah, well, this pasty little goober

01:11:55.416 --> 01:11:58.458
is about to rob his second bank
for our daughter.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:11:59.833
I like him.

01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:05.333
[Owen] I'm sorry,
but I don't know what I'm doing.

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:08.416
My bank got robbed
and I didn't do anything to stop it.

01:12:08.416 --> 01:12:11.208
I suck! I suck so bad!

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:12.666
First off, stop crying.

01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:15.500
Whenever I hear babies cry, I lactate.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:17.875
Can't ruin another suit.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.333
Look, I need your help.

01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:23.333
Can you show me your vault so I can see
what a real security system looks like?

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:25.958
- So you want to see inside my vault?
- Yeah.

01:12:25.958 --> 01:12:29.083
Remember when I told you a Butterball
turkey could break into your vault?

01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:31.375
- Yeah, I remember.
- Make that sound.

01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:35.125
If I do, would you let me into the vault?

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:37.291
Do it!
[imitates turkey gobbling] Come on!

01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:40.333
- [imitates gobbling]
- With your throat.

01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:42.666
- [both gobbling]
- Louder.

01:12:42.666 --> 01:12:45.291
- [gobbling loudly]
- There you go.

01:12:45.291 --> 01:12:47.416
[gobbling continues muted]

01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:51.291
Let's go.

01:12:51.916 --> 01:12:53.916
[suspenseful music playing]

01:12:57.333 --> 01:12:58.166
[Owen] Wow!

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:02.041
- Pretty heavy duty.
- [Phoebe] Yeah, you like that, huh?

01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:04.083
[giggles] It's a decoy!

01:13:04.083 --> 01:13:07.125
I'm not gonna have a safe this pathetic.
What am I, you?

01:13:07.708 --> 01:13:11.708
[mockingly] "I'll just put one big circle
on the front and that's what locks it."

01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:12.791
Freak.

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:16.041
- Don't look.
- Okay.

01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:17.416
[keypad beeping]

01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:22.166
The last numbers are irrelevant.
That's how I masturbate.

01:13:22.166 --> 01:13:23.916
[keypad beeping]

01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:25.666
[snorts]

01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:28.916
That feels good.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
- [lock whirring]
- [joyous classical music playing]

01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:43.083
[softly] Phoebe King.

01:13:43.916 --> 01:13:45.208
You know it, bitch.

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.416
Is that...

01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:54.583
Triple-enforced titanium with digital,
manual, and combination locks?

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:58.250
Pussy.

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:01.000
Don't tell me
when I can take a fuckin' break.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.833
I take a break
when I fuckin' feel like it.

01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:06.208
[laughs] Shit! You know what I mean?
I don't care if it ain't--

01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:11.625
That Owen's parents?
The fuck are they doing at the job?

01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:14.458
Mr. and Mrs. Browning!
What's going on with y'all?

01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:16.000
[laughing] How y'all doing?

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.416
Why y'all look like that?
Y'all look real stiff and kinda paranoid.

01:14:19.416 --> 01:14:22.458
Real statuesque, like you...
you in a wax museum or something.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.541
[chuckling]

01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:27.041
- Hey, is that a cop in your backseat?
- [Oldham] I'm not a cop.

01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:30.500
I'm an agent.
And could you please keep your voice down?

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.708
First of all,
what's the fuckin' difference, okay?

01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:35.125
You don't run nothing here!
This ain't your jurisdiction!

01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:37.500
- [whispers] Tyree! Tyree! Shh!
- What?

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.583
Don't tell anybody,
but your bank's about to be robbed.

01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:43.541
What do you mean, don't tell nobody?
They about to rob the bank again?

01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:45.083
- Shh!
- [yelling] What the fuck, man?

01:14:45.083 --> 01:14:48.125
Damn it! Man, I haven't even...
I left some shit in the microwave!

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:50.166
- Shh!
- Fuck! I haven't even taken my lunch yet!

01:14:50.166 --> 01:14:51.416
No, you don't shush me!

01:14:51.416 --> 01:14:53.125
- Fuck this! I'm out.
- [Oldham] Ugh!

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:56.125
- [Tyree yells in distance] Fuck! The fuck...
- Why did you say that?

01:14:56.125 --> 01:15:00.041
- I told you not to say anything.
- [Tyree faintly] This job fucking sucks!

01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:02.750
[softly] Just like Owen
told you not to say anything.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.208
It's a setup! It's a setup!
They're going after a different bank!

01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:11.291
- [Oldham groans]
- [thrilling music playing]

01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:14.125
- [grunts] Get out, I'm taking the car.
- Not a chance.

01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:17.208
It's taken me years
to get this seat exactly the way I like.

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:18.458
Oh, God!

01:15:20.208 --> 01:15:21.583
God damn it!

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.833
- Where to?
- Atlas Reserve! They're desperate.

01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:27.583
- [thrilling music stops suddenly]
- [Oldham] Come on! Come on!

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.333
