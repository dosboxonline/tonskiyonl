<i>REAL 92.3,
L.A.'s new home for hip-hop,</i>

00:47.006 --> 00:48.673
- Big Boy's Neighborhood.
-<i>Big Boy!</i>

00:48.674 --> 00:49.841
<i>Good morning, L.A.
You guys know</i>

00:49.842 --> 00:51.342
<i>- it is the first of the month...</i>
-<i>Morning!</i>

00:51.343 --> 00:53.303
<i>...and I know all of our
neighbors, all our hustlers,</i>

00:53.304 --> 00:54.930

but...</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:57.432

<i>Caller number 92,

01:01.896 --> 01:04.480
<i>if you need some cash
from Payday Whenever.</i>

01:04.482 --> 01:06.983
<i>Now, it's going to be hot
out there-- Extremely hot--</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:09.861
<i>So make sure that you keep
that AC blasting today,</i>

01:09.862 --> 01:11.446
{\an8}<i>or make your way to the beach</i>

01:11.447 --> 01:13.323
{\an8}<i>'cause you know it's always
cooler on the Westside.</i>

01:13.324 --> 01:14.950
{\an8}<i>-But, most importantly...</i>
-Oh, yeah.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.286
<i>...coming up right here
in</i> Big Boy's Neighborhood.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.881
{\an8}Hey, Tony, Larry's gonna
need an extra side of eggs.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.466
{\an8}He didn't say it,
but I already know it's coming.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.510
-Need some help!
- I got it, I got it.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.094
If he wanted to,
he would.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.680
All right. Y'all really got it
cracking last night, huh?

01:37.681 --> 01:39.641
Yeah, and we're doing it
again tonight.

01:39.642 --> 01:41.309
- Come with us!
- Oh, girl, no, I can't.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.852
But y'all go have fun.
Don't forget

01:42.853 --> 01:44.687
to wash your ass, though.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.231
All right. Grab this for you.

01:46.232 --> 01:48.858
You know my grandson Lawrence.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.945
Y'all would make
a perfect match.

01:51.946 --> 01:55.114
- Miss Dorothy.
- He looks like Tyler Perry.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.199
"Hellur."

01:56.200 --> 01:58.368
And loves the Lord
just like him, too.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.494
I love that.
Can I get an "amen"?

01:59.495 --> 02:00.578
Amen.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.122
Let me know
if y'all need anything else.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.376
We're running out of plates
back there.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.963
Why is it so wet back here?
I'm about to break my damn neck.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.381
I'm doing my best!

02:11.382 --> 02:13.258
- Okay, Joe.
- I'm sorry.

02:13.259 --> 02:15.969
The dishwasher's broke. I got
to dry these bitches by hand.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.096
You know the steam cycle
can be a little finicky.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.722
- You got to get on back there...
- Yeah, I know.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.266
I've tried everything.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.643
All I'm saying is
last time I did it, I had to go

02:23.644 --> 02:25.812
- into the back back.
- Yeah, I'm in the back back.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.106
Yeah, but, man, that's...

02:28.107 --> 02:30.108
Look, I'm not trying to stop you
from what you're doing,

02:30.109 --> 02:31.985
but the button you...

02:31.986 --> 02:33.069
I fixed it.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.445
- Okay. Okay.
- I fixed it.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.530
You might have did something.

02:35.531 --> 02:36.615
I fixed it.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.659
I'm all right.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.579
Man, I was talking about

02:42.580 --> 02:44.163
the handle in the back.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.623
You okay, Joe?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.667
I think
I shit my pants.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.171
I'm not built for this.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.424
Neither was that wall.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.101
Don't look at me like that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.936
I had to get a jump
from Shameeka.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.730
Then they put a fucking
roadblock up on La Brea.

03:08.731 --> 03:10.315
I had to go all the way around.
I'm sorry.

03:10.316 --> 03:11.399
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

03:11.400 --> 03:12.567
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.194
I didn't forget. I just was
going through mad shit.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.280
I swear to God.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.577
For real, I am sorry.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.497
I-I wasn't trying to be...

03:27.875 --> 03:29.375
Because, actually,
you're on time.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.878
I got off at 7:00.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.422
- Damn.
- I got you good, huh?

03:34.423 --> 03:35.715
You know me so well.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.009
And I still got you this.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.012
<i>♪ That's my girl ♪</i>

03:41.013 --> 03:42.805
<i>- ♪ Yes, I'm your girl ♪</i>
-  Extra cheese?

03:42.806 --> 03:44.140
Yes, and I really
shouldn't have done it

03:44.141 --> 03:46.059
because you gonna blow up
the bathroom later.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.310
Well, don't worry about me.
I'mma be fine.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.686
Two kisses up to God,
and I'll be straight.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.647
What does that have to do
with your stomach?

03:50.648 --> 03:52.524
- This is not...
- God heals all things.

03:53.484 --> 03:54.609
Girl, you're lactose intolerant.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.486
Tummies included,
tummies included.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.821
You need to pray more.
That's your fucking problem.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.835
Okay, Ms. Jones,
tell me why you're

04:12.836 --> 04:16.255
the perfect candidate to be
a corporate franchise manager.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.966
I think I'm the perfect
candidate bec...

04:17.966 --> 04:19.760
Ah! Don't say you think.
Say you are.

04:20.678 --> 04:21.678
Okay.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.181
Well, sir,
I am the perfect candidate

04:25.182 --> 04:26.265
because I've served

04:26.266 --> 04:27.642
- many an omelet...
- Mm-hmm.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.352
I have dealt
with many customers.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.020
Drunk, high, sleepy...
you name it.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.563
I've opened. I've closed.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.190
I created
the wheelchair section.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.985
And made sure that the store
was ADA compliant.

04:36.986 --> 04:40.405
Damn! Bitch, you should've
had about ten Norms by now.

04:40.406 --> 04:41.990
Girl, I got to work my way up.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.324
People at this level
have degrees,

04:43.325 --> 04:44.534
and I still have
15 credits left.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.285
I'm just happy
that they let me apply.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.954
Uh, first off, greedy.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.039
Second off, that's what
they want you to think, okay?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.958
They can't control you
when you know your worth.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.668
- Honey, it's in here.
- Okay, okay.

04:53.669 --> 04:55.545
Have you ever seen your manager
do anything you cannot do?

04:55.546 --> 04:57.046
- No.
- Exactly.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.673
They need to stop
putting all that work on my girl

04:58.674 --> 05:01.092
without the proper promotion, okay?

05:01.093 --> 05:02.635
You been that girl!

05:02.636 --> 05:04.178
- Been that girl.
- Okay.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.680
You know,
you got to walk in your purpose.

05:05.681 --> 05:06.848
It's like Keshawn always say,

05:06.849 --> 05:08.182
"If you got the biggest dick
in the room,

05:08.183 --> 05:09.642
"you got to swing that shit."

05:09.643 --> 05:12.854
Girl, why are we always talking
about Keshawn's funky-ass dick?

05:12.855 --> 05:14.939
Um, it's not funky. It's mine.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.899
And second off,
he be dropping gems.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.860
Pee-ew!

05:18.861 --> 05:20.361
You're gonna be fine.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.405
You got this.
I already put up a prayer.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.532
You know I got the direct line
to the ancestors.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.618
Well, girl,
they're not listening.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.038
You gave the rent
to Uche, right?

05:29.788 --> 05:31.081
Yeah, he got the money.
We straight.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.585
Good. Last thing we need is him
banging on the door again.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.171
Not to worry.

05:42.593 --> 05:43.801
You know
this gonna take a minute.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.137
Go in, and I'll find a spot.

05:46.597 --> 05:47.598
Thanks, pookie.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.647
Damn, Fabian.

05:56.982 --> 05:57.983
What happened?

05:58.984 --> 06:00.526
Uche kicked me out this morning.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.736
It was all bad.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.322
Uche can't cut nobody no break.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.448
Didn't your grandma just die?

06:05.449 --> 06:06.783
She ain't even
in the ground yet.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.785
An eviction's gonna
fuck up my credit.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.036
I can't afford to live
anywhere else.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.789
Your life is lifing.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.040
Uche know he wrong.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.333
Sorry, man.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.251
Hey, you want to buy
my grandma's vintage speaker?

06:17.252 --> 06:20.880
Ah, no. I think you should
hold on to all your memories.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.174
It'll be a'ight.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.469
Maybe somebody want to
buy this speaker or my vinyls?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.013
I got some good vinyls.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.432
Oh. Hey, ladies. You want to buy
a bucket hat for a buck?

06:40.776 --> 06:42.485
-Mama Ruth!
- It's open.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.570
Music's so loud.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.616
Hey, Mama.

06:48.617 --> 06:49.700
You got some orange juice?

06:49.701 --> 06:51.369
Yeah, should be some over there.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.538
Hey, Dreux, isn't
your interview today, baby?

06:53.539 --> 06:56.624
- Yeah, not till 4:00, though.
- Now, you're gonna do good.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.792
Hey, did you hear?

06:57.793 --> 07:00.419
Girl, we about to get us
a white neighbor.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.880
I ain't never seen
no white people in The Jungles.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.424
- You know Jameel be lying.
- No, they do exist.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.635
I have seen it
with my own two eyes.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.471
Chile, I saw one
with a cat in a stroller.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.556
I was done.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.307
Yeah, well, they ain't moving
into this raggedy building,

07:13.308 --> 07:14.810
I can tell you that.

07:25.821 --> 07:26.989
Morning, Mama Ruth.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.699
Hey, Maniac.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.001
Handle that shit.

07:41.587 --> 07:42.963
Sup?

07:45.424 --> 07:46.425
It's my...

07:47.259 --> 07:49.553
Day started early.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.679
I'm a little sleepy.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.390
Can I get them honey buns?

07:55.267 --> 07:56.560
Oh, uh...

07:57.477 --> 07:59.270
Behind you. I just... I didn't
want to reach back there.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.855
Oh.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.024
You mean
the sweet ones.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.318
Not that mine aren't sweet.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.738
- That was weird.
- I'll just go ahead.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.948
I'll... slide out your way.

08:10.949 --> 08:14.161
<i>♪ Electric slide ♪</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:18.999
You want it?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.877
Oh. I mean, yeah.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.136
Thank you, Mama Ruth.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.304
I'll catch you later.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.015
All right. Thank you, baby.

08:40.854 --> 08:41.855
See you around.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.943
Place is small, so you...

08:47.361 --> 08:48.986
Damn, girl.
Are you okay?

08:48.987 --> 08:50.488
I mean, I thought
you was having a stroke.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.615
I couldn't understand
a word you was saying.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.908
Shit, I started feeling like

08:53.909 --> 08:56.410
my honey buns
needed to be split open.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.495
Uh, Okay.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.247
I am not worried about that boy.

08:59.248 --> 09:02.083
I don't do the streets. And he
been trouble since we were kids.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.335
Yeah, well, that boy
is a grown-ass man now.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.045
A grown man that would
choke you to death.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.881
Yeah, well, it just depends
on how he does it.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.508
A lot of information
is happening here

09:10.509 --> 09:11.717
- that I don't need to know.
- Mm-hmm.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.802
Thank you. Love you.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.222
Good luck, baby.
No more night shifts!

09:22.229 --> 09:23.313
Hey.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.273
- Hey.
- What's up, girl?

09:25.274 --> 09:26.482
Mm-hmm.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.984
No, he ain't finna...

09:27.985 --> 09:30.319
So, what are we gonna do?
The boho knotless braids.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.030
-That is avant-garde.
- Jameel!

09:32.948 --> 09:34.282
And what the fuck are you doing?

09:34.283 --> 09:35.950
Girl, watch your goddamn mouth.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.034
First of all,
who you talking to?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.078
I know you're not gonna try me
on the first,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.122
knowing damn well
I'm with a paying client.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.832
- You do have cash, right?
- Yeah.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.709
You are so dirty!

09:44.710 --> 09:47.128
You told me you were gonna
finish my hair this morning.

09:47.129 --> 09:50.298
Can you please go inside
and we can handle this later?

09:50.299 --> 09:52.049
I'm so sorry. This is so ghetto.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.384
This is ghetto?

09:53.385 --> 09:55.386
Then what is this?

09:55.387 --> 09:57.930
-Damn.
- Yeah. You see this, girl?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.181
Unprofessional!

09:59.182 --> 10:01.350
You know what's professional?
An updo.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.269
Wrap that shit
in a ponytail and go.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.895
But you ain't even
dipped the ends.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.815
If you don't go, I'mma tell Uche
you broke the intercom.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.525
I'm not joking with you, Dreux.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.902
- Wow. Wow.
- I have business to do.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.696
All right,
let me just finish your head.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.031
You know, folks be acting crazy

10:15.032 --> 10:16.408
on the first.

10:17.576 --> 10:18.577
What?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.870
Hold up, Peanut died?

10:20.871 --> 10:23.039
Hell, yeah. King Lolo got him.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.290
But why?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.043
Said he looked at him.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.668
Like, wrong?

10:27.669 --> 10:28.961
No.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.630
Just looked at him.

10:37.971 --> 10:38.972
Damn.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.474
Did you hear what happened
to Peanut? Oh!

10:41.475 --> 10:42.558
Oh, my God.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.144
- Girl!
- Please.

10:44.895 --> 10:45.936
Girl, why is Keshawn's stuff

10:45.937 --> 10:47.480
all over the damn place?

10:47.481 --> 10:50.107
Girl, and why he always got some
new shoes? With what income?

10:50.108 --> 10:52.610
Oh, my God. It's like
three pairs. You gassing.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.071
Girl, it's an obstacle course
in here.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.531
We been saying
we're trying to exercise more.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.575
Every time we stumble,
we get more steps.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.079
I mean, really?
On your paintings?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.247
Why? The floor's right here.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.541
He said the floor is dirty.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.751
Okay? And fuck this painting.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.086
It's not even that good.
Who cares?

11:10.087 --> 11:11.420
You say that about all of 'em.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.130
I mean, how do you expect
for your artwork

11:13.131 --> 11:15.299
to get into MoMA
if you treat 'em like doormats?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.301
The universe
is going to guide me

11:17.302 --> 11:19.470
- where I'm supposed to go. Okay?
-Oh, boy.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.390
Damn!

11:22.057 --> 11:24.475
Damn. It's a big one.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.936
Uche gotta fix this, man.
It's dangerous.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.605
Damn. He got to fix the windows,
the walls,

11:29.606 --> 11:31.023
the nails on the floorboard.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.108
Hey.

11:32.109 --> 11:35.112
Can y'all... keep it down?

11:35.695 --> 11:36.695
Excuse me?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.614
You know, I'm just saying,
we already got three people

11:38.615 --> 11:40.866
living in one space, right?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.160
We got to be a little bit more
thoughtful around here.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.830
Is that motherfucker
wearing my robe?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.957
I mean, you mad?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.458
What's up, baby?

11:49.459 --> 11:51.210
- Happy anniversary.
- Mm.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.170
Anniversary for what?

11:53.171 --> 11:57.925
Um, that's six months since me
and Alyssa been living together.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.594
Oh, has it already
been six months?

12:00.595 --> 12:03.889
That's funny. I remember when
it was supposed to be six days.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.641
That's not nice. Be nice.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.352
Keshawn is right... We should
all be more thoughtful.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.396
And, you know,
since we're taking requests,

12:10.397 --> 12:12.648
could you get your
goddamn shoes off the floor?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.692
- Are you done?
- No, I've got more.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.405
You know, Dreux,

12:18.530 --> 12:21.782
one of the homeys asked me
about you the other day,

12:21.783 --> 12:25.787
to my, like, divine surprise,
but I was like...

12:28.623 --> 12:29.875
"Nah."

12:31.585 --> 12:33.335
I'mma-I'mma go lie down.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.837
You're not helping my case.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.046
Get some rest.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.799
And a... And a brush, too.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.968
-Can I have the robe?
- What?

12:40.969 --> 12:42.512
Please, can I have the robe?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.849
Oh, yeah.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.684
Sorry about that.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.036
What in the Medusa?
Girl, I almost turned to stone.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.997
I feel bad
for even looking. My apologies,

13:09.998 --> 13:12.416
but it's all making sense.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.834
- I know.
- You got to resist.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.336
I can't. I tried.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.670
He can make it wave at me.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.089
But he's taking advantage.
He can't keep staying here

13:19.090 --> 13:20.257
and not pitching in.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.468
Uche already want to get us
up out of here,

13:22.469 --> 13:25.054
and he apparently moving
white people in.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.680
Okay, it's a problem.
I'm gonna fix it.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.098
I'm gonna talk to him. I got it.

13:28.099 --> 13:31.018
You just got in from
the night shift. Just go rest.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.102
Talk to him.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.312
Is Jameel gonna finish
your hair?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.149
Girl, the fight
we just got into...

13:37.108 --> 13:39.109
I don't think we're gonna
ever speak again.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.284
Ooh.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.684
Alyssa, get the damn door!

14:19.651 --> 14:20.944
Okay, okay.

14:21.903 --> 14:22.904
Okay.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.656
Motherfucker, what you want...

14:25.657 --> 14:26.949
Oh, uh...

14:26.950 --> 14:28.034
Hi, Uche.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.789
You look real alopecious today.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.791
Do you know what happens
to people in my country

14:35.792 --> 14:37.126
who do not pay their rent?

14:37.127 --> 14:39.044
You're expecting me to know
what happens

14:39.045 --> 14:40.546
when people don't pay their rent
in your country? I don't...

14:40.547 --> 14:42.464
Give me my money so I can go.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.383
Oh, I think
there's some kind of confusion,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.135
because Alyssa gave you
your money.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.053
But can we talk about
this stank-ass water situation?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.263
She did not pay me.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.098
Yes, she did. She told me.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.517
Do I look like a man
who misplaces money?

14:53.518 --> 14:54.893
No.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.562
She is a liar.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.814
And so are you.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.984
I am going home
by six of the clock today.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.695
If I don't have my rent by then,
you and your friend will join

15:04.696 --> 15:07.406
that hairy, small man
on the curb.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.867
- Wait... Uche.
- I mean it. I mean it.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.953
No more late rent, Dreux.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.663
No more.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.334
Oh, goddamn.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.758
Alyssa?

15:25.800 --> 15:26.801
Alyssa!

15:28.678 --> 15:29.679
Alyssa.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.436
Yo, Dreux, you-you got to relax.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.396
I mean, honestly,
you're like this

15:39.397 --> 15:41.565
every single time
that I see you.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.442
I'm worried
about your blood pressure.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.985
Where's Alyssa?

15:44.986 --> 15:47.905
Oh, she-she in there.
She's really tired, though.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.573
- Okay.
- 'Cause of the intercourse.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.992
I thought it was because
she's carrying your ass.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.578
So funny.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.873
So Keshawn
blew your backbone out, too?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.918
What?

16:01.002 --> 16:04.089
Girl, I came in here to talk
to him about moving out,

16:05.173 --> 16:08.468
and then...
I don't know what happened.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.429
I got to work this shit out.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.972
I need to creatively exercise.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.017
- You need an exorcism.
- Yeah-huh.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.810
Girl, why is Uche
at the door saying

16:17.811 --> 16:19.061
he doesn't have his rent money?

16:19.062 --> 16:21.230
That's a lie. He has it.
Are you sure?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.649
Because you know he doesn't
play about his shit, Alyssa.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.734
Yes, bitch, I'm sure.
Keshawn said he gave it to him.

16:25.735 --> 16:26.820
Alyssa.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.322
You did not give Keshawn
our rent money.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.033
What if I did?

16:34.911 --> 16:37.538
You playing, right? Tell me you
playing, or I'mma beat your ass.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.415
What?  Calm down.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.791
I'mma call him
in here right now,

16:40.792 --> 16:41.959
- and it'll be clear.
- Come on, call him.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.378
Keshawn.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.505
Mm-hmm.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.716
Keshawn!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.352
Wasn't that nigga just here?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.438
Oh, shit.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.941
Hey!

17:06.151 --> 17:07.152
Damn!

17:07.736 --> 17:08.819
You think he heard us
talking about him?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.613
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:11.906 --> 17:13.824
Girl, Keshawn took our rent
and dipped.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.617
Why would you give him
the money, Alyssa?

17:15.617 --> 17:17.327
Girl, you need to call him up
on the phone

17:17.328 --> 17:19.579
and tell him to get back here
A-fucking-SAP.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.624
Calm down.
I'm calling him right now.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.877
He knew how to clean
this whole time.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.627
Probably just forgot
to drop the cash off.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.796
He's an entrepreneur.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.339
- He's doing like 50,000...
- Just call him!

17:29.340 --> 17:30.425
I'm calling.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.439
Ugh. I don't get it.
How he remember to take

17:45.440 --> 17:47.691
all 500 pair of his shoes
but not his phone?

17:47.692 --> 17:50.319
I forgot. I stole one while
he was asleep. He has two.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.196
I'm not even gonna
unpack that right now.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.490
We need to find this bum-ass
nigga before he spends up

17:54.491 --> 17:56.700
all our money on parlays.
Where would he be?

17:56.701 --> 17:58.702
Girl, I don't know.
Can't you tell I'm lost?

17:58.703 --> 18:01.413
Girl, if we don't get this money
to Uche by 6:00 p.m.,

18:01.414 --> 18:03.373
we're gonna be on the curb
with Fabian.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.458
Like, do you know the passcode?

18:04.459 --> 18:06.001
- Shit, let me try.
- Ah.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.587
Let me work my magic.
I'm trying to channel something.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.348
Nothing. I tried everything.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.141
His birthday, my birthday,
his ex's birthday,

18:21.142 --> 18:25.479
his favorite sex positions.
66, 69, 99, 469...

18:25.480 --> 18:27.689
469? How you do that?

18:27.690 --> 18:30.400
It's basically like a backwards
push-up into the pussy.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.485
I could show you better
than I can tell you.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.653
That's okay.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.655
I'm gonna go get dressed,
and we gonna get some help.

18:34.656 --> 18:35.740
Me, too.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.372
I did not need this shit today.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.559
- Hey. Shameeka, what's going on?
- Girl, new neighbors.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.327
Ooh! Shooter, no!

19:21.744 --> 19:22.745
Sorry.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.373
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.459
-Thank you.
- Damn, that was quick.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.502
Uche bringing this bitch
cookies.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.297
- What?
- Oh, hell, no.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.381
My crew, right here.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.466
Front and center.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.845
So, um... the kids
can't have no cookie?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.682
Oh, my God! I'm obsessed
with these matching outfits.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.519
Hello, children.
Would you like a cookie?

19:47.812 --> 19:48.896
Well, don't be scared, chile.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.731
Go up there and get y'all
a cookie.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.150
Take a fucking cookie.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.319
Thank you.
Thank you.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.070
Let me know
if you need anything.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.115
I-I definitely will. Thank you.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.868
Oh, no, Shooter.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.037
Excellent.

20:04.579 --> 20:05.829
- Excellent.
-  Okay.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.123
Um...

20:07.707 --> 20:09.374
Hello, everyone.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.170
I'm Bethany,
and this is Shooter.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.757
I actually rescued him a few
months ago from around here.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.342
I think he's having
a little PTSD,

20:18.343 --> 20:19.427
- but...
- Oh.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.429
I'm sure
he'll settle in just fine.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.265
Just like me. So, uh...

20:25.683 --> 20:28.018
Thanks for welcoming us
to Baldwin Village.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.313
What's Baldwin Village?

20:32.941 --> 20:34.858
Nice to see ladies my age.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.027
- Hey.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.404
What's good to eat around here?

20:39.280 --> 20:42.700
Oxtails, grits, greens,
yams, Tam's, M&M'S.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.326
A lot of shit.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.203
- I'll send you a list.
-Okay.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.372
Um, I am right here if you guys
ever want to have

20:48.373 --> 20:49.623
- a girls' night.
- Oh.

20:49.624 --> 20:52.084
A little
"prosecco and pals" situation.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.710
Come on, drinks.

20:53.711 --> 20:54.796
Okay.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.588

21:00.385 --> 21:03.053
See? See?

21:03.054 --> 21:05.222

but y'all don't be listening.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.848

21:12.605 --> 21:14.439
You know I'm in high demand.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.525
Besides,
we got bigger fish to fry.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.318
Let me see this hair.
Yeah, it look nice.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.778
- Did you comb out the middle?
- Jameel.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.279
You want me
to roller-set the ends?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.532
No. We want you
to break into this phone.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.575
Oh, my God, shut up.
I got a client here.

21:25.576 --> 21:28.453
Keep your mouth down. You know
I don't do that no more.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.538
Who phone?

21:29.539 --> 21:31.373
That fine homeless boyfriend?

21:31.374 --> 21:33.083
Uh, why he got to be homeless?

21:33.084 --> 21:34.626
Have you been to his home?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.920
His apartment was flooded
when we met.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.088
Oh, how convenient.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.465
You know what, you should get
on Tinder, find you a good man.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.426
A good, housed man with a roof.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.052
He is housed.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.387
Ah-ah.

21:45.388 --> 21:46.638
- Stay on task.
- Come on.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.723
Hundred dollars.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.558
- A hundred dollars?
- Hundred dollars.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.476
- Do you take IOUs?
- You didn't even do her hair.

21:51.477 --> 21:52.562
It's the least you could do.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.189
Bitch, is this
Berniece the Bully?

21:56.190 --> 21:58.233
He gonna cheat and steal

21:58.234 --> 21:59.693
Like Big Booty Berniece?
Stay on Coco?

21:59.694 --> 22:00.902
How they know each other?

22:00.903 --> 22:03.280
Girl, apparently,
they met at the park.

22:03.281 --> 22:04.865
I wasn't even gonna say
nothing to her

22:04.866 --> 22:06.450
until I collected
more information.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.951
I'm not even that type of bitch.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.619
Period. So, so, what happened?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.372
It was about a week ago.

22:12.582 --> 22:13.583
Allegedly.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.376
<i>So, Big Booty
Bitch-Ass Bully Berniece</i>

22:16.377 --> 22:17.753
<i>was up at Jim Gilliam</i>

22:17.754 --> 22:20.505
<i>being thirsty, looking parched.
You know the usual.</i>

22:39.525 --> 22:41.902
<i>What?
How do you know all this?</i>

22:41.903 --> 22:44.738
<i>Jameel nosy ass.
He said he saw the whole thing.</i>

22:44.739 --> 22:47.699
<i>As Jameel tells it,
when she likes your man,</i>

22:47.700 --> 22:49.827
<i>she'll take him and stop
at nothing to keep him.</i>

22:56.876 --> 22:57.960
<i>Damn.</i>

22:58.628 --> 23:00.504
They did all that
in front of the kids.

23:00.505 --> 23:01.588
Girl, allegedly.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.340
I don't even know if I believe
all that ice cream shit, though.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.050
You know Jameel be putting
twenties on tens.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.676
I see why you stole his phone.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.679
What time is it?

23:09.889 --> 23:11.641
He with that bitch right now.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.392
- Let's go over there.
- Okay.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.395
'Cause we need to get
our money back ASAP.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.445
Girl, we can't park here.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.447

Tumbleweave.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.626
This don't even
make no damn sense.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.671
I told you
my mom's got arthritis.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.338
What the fuck? You...

23:43.339 --> 23:45.966
Girl, you just gonna let him

23:45.967 --> 23:47.384
-Mm-hmm

23:47.385 --> 23:48.885
Pay the rent.
That's okay.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.220
God is on my side.

23:50.221 --> 23:52.848
I be praying doors be open
around this motherfucker.

23:52.849 --> 23:53.932

23:57.603 --> 23:59.020
All right. I got a idea.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.356
Go around the back.
Go around the back.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.692
I'll find a way in.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.530
Looking good, shorty.

24:08.531 --> 24:09.948
Gonna get on
through y'all, okay?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.032
You smell that?

24:11.033 --> 24:12.701
Smell like body spray.

24:12.702 --> 24:13.785
Mm. That smells

24:13.786 --> 24:14.912
- good enough to eat.
- I'm gonna pass you.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.955
Better not have no man.
I know that much.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.292
I don't even like men.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.045
Girl.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.463
You took forever.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.466
A little spooky-ooky down there.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.302
How you been? It's been so long.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.387
Smell good.
Remind me of my uncle.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.473
- Who are you?
- Your friend.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.933
You don't remember?

24:36.934 --> 24:38.476
- Bitch, I don't know you.
- Girl.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.812
All the fun we done had.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.356
Let me remind you.

24:44.859 --> 24:45.860
Got your ass.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.203
I remember the way
you would mob in a room.

24:56.204 --> 24:58.246
I'm like,
"Whew, that girl is bold.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.249
"You know, she just take shit."

25:13.221 --> 25:14.512
Okay, nigga.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.764
I mean, you inspired me.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.224
Look, I'm up for a promotion
right now,

25:17.225 --> 25:20.143

I'm channeling you.

25:20.144 --> 25:22.562
- I mean, I am that "B."
- Okay.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.482
- And been that "B." All right.
- Been that "B."

25:34.659 --> 25:36.076
-Alyssa?
- Shut your fucking mouth.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.160
Shut it.

25:37.161 --> 25:38.411
Remember them
high school dances,

25:38.412 --> 25:40.497
grinding to Pretty Ricky?

25:40.498 --> 25:42.415
Girl, niggas be drooling
over you.

25:42.416 --> 25:43.541
That's how I'm trying to be.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.126
Wait, you was on the dance team?

25:45.127 --> 25:46.836
Girl, yup. Yup.
That was me in the back,

25:46.837 --> 25:49.172
over there at Crenshaw.
Crenshaw.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.384
- At Crenshaw.
- Pass it to you.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.302
I went to Dorsey.

25:54.679 --> 25:55.679
What are you, stealing from me?

25:55.680 --> 25:57.055
No, nigga, you stealing from me.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.723
You were supposed to take
the rent money to Uche,

25:58.724 --> 26:00.058
but instead you in
another bitch bed.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.184
No! That, um...

26:01.185 --> 26:02.519
And where the fuck is the money?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.271
- Right. That's what I said.
-Yeah.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.897
Dorsey Dons with Miss...

26:05.898 --> 26:06.983

- Hale.

26:07.858 --> 26:10.068
I-I invested it, for me and you.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.403
You know, I was gonna
surprise you about it,

26:11.404 --> 26:13.655
but actually...
I'm so glad you here.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.949
Um, stay right there. Don't go.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.867
Back before they was
calling you Big Booty,

26:17.868 --> 26:19.327
when there was barely a booty.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.453
You had some peanuts
on your back.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.997
Ass been fat.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.081
Right.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.833
So I don't know what the fuck
you talking about.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.544
Oh, right. Right.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.880
Who the fuck are you?

26:30.881 --> 26:34.134

T-shirt line. Yeah!

26:34.135 --> 26:35.468
I'm going for a more, like,

26:35.469 --> 26:37.387

a high-end quality fabric.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.471
Baby, listen to this.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.849
- It's acrylic.
-"Cucci"?

26:40.308 --> 26:41.308
Feel on that.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.018
Shit feel highly flammable, nigga.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.853
Good stuff is flammable.
That's high quality.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.855
Are you stupid? This is more
important than a place to live?

26:46.856 --> 26:49.566
The only reason why I borrowed
the money-- The loan...

26:49.567 --> 26:50.734
is because I just needed

26:50.735 --> 26:52.861
a little bit of bread to get
going, you know what I'm saying?

26:52.862 --> 26:55.822
But I'mma flip these, then I'mma
give it right back to you, baby.

26:55.823 --> 26:56.948
- You gonna flip these?
- Times ten.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.034
- Stop! What are you...
-  Lying ass!

27:01.329 --> 27:02.829
- What the fuck?
- Wait. Wait.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.331
- What the fuck is...
-Hold up!

27:04.332 --> 27:05.540
I barely know
what she looks like.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.043
I swear to God,
I only hit it from behind.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.170
-You lied to me.
- Who the fuck are you?

27:10.588 --> 27:12.881
Motherfucker, I'll...

27:12.882 --> 27:14.800
Alyssa, run. Come on!

27:17.345 --> 27:19.137
Shit.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.349
It's a damn villain's lair.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.976
Fucking snake.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.355
- Is she coming?
- Girl, I don't know. Keep going!

27:30.316 --> 27:31.816
Where the fuck is my car?

27:31.817 --> 27:34.110
Girl, I told you
not to fucking park here.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.195
Shit.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.780
Come on!

27:36.781 --> 27:37.864
Oh, my God.

27:39.367 --> 27:40.492
Alyssa, run faster.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.577
I'm trying!

27:42.620 --> 27:43.788
Shit.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.875
Oh, damn!

27:48.876 --> 27:49.960
What the fuck?

27:50.753 --> 27:53.004
Come on.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.382
She needs some milk.

27:54.757 --> 27:55.758
I'm fine!

27:57.343 --> 27:58.885
- Just let me--
- I'm fine!

27:58.886 --> 27:59.970
Nigga.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.180
That ain't even hurt.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.475
-Shit!
-That's what she gets.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.644
- Walk it off, girl.
- Damn. Ooh!

28:07.645 --> 28:09.730
- Oh, y'all think that was bad?
-Yeah!

28:10.523 --> 28:12.691
Hmm? Y'all think that was bad?

28:13.984 --> 28:15.694
Watch what I do to them hoes!

28:18.531 --> 28:20.532
I can't fucking run no more.

28:20.533 --> 28:21.992
I-I can't fucking run.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.622
- I can't fucking run no more.
- Damn.

28:28.791 --> 28:29.917
You think she okay?

28:30.584 --> 28:31.585
She straight.

28:32.253 --> 28:33.254
She strong.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.047
Yeah, if we make a loop,

28:35.840 --> 28:38.049
take Hillcrest,
we can get back to Uche,

28:38.050 --> 28:40.094
give him the money and just
lay low till the interview.

28:41.554 --> 28:42.888
I ain't got the money.

28:47.476 --> 28:48.893
What?

28:48.894 --> 28:49.978
Keshawn spent it.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.648
On a fucking T-shirt line.

28:53.858 --> 28:56.192
Why would you give
the money to Keshawn?

28:56.193 --> 28:58.112
Damn.

28:58.696 --> 28:59.904
I'm sorry.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.865
Listen, we can't focus
on the past right now.

29:01.866 --> 29:04.284
We got to focus on the future.
We don't have the money.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.578
We just got to make the money.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.621
We got to make the money
by 6:00? $1,500?

29:08.622 --> 29:10.748
Not to mention
I got the interview at 4:00.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.958
Alyssa, come on, man.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.168
I should be
getting my hair done,

29:13.169 --> 29:14.294
getting my mind right.

29:14.295 --> 29:15.713
You look great to me.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.256
You got to have faith.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.924
Gonna be all right.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.009
It'll work out.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.510
It don't just work out.

29:22.511 --> 29:24.430
We need a plan.
You need a plan, man.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.564
Is that
what I think it is?

29:42.323 --> 29:44.324
No, I don't want to trust you
any longer.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.534
- That's not even that bad.
- What?

29:46.535 --> 29:47.619
Just watch.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.870
What the hell
are you talking about?

29:48.871 --> 29:50.998
Just hear them out.
Hear what they got to say.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.458
Don't do it, ladies.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.751
Don't do it.

29:54.752 --> 29:55.836
It's a trap.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.046
- Don't do it.
-  Girl, see, this is...

29:58.047 --> 29:59.923
- And it's a cycle. It's a cycle.
-This is bad energy

29:59.924 --> 30:01.174
- sent to distract you.
- It keep happening.

30:01.175 --> 30:02.258
- It's a cycle.
- You have to stay focused.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.093
Once you go in,
you can't get out.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.721
- Evil spirit, begone.
- It's a trap and a cycle.

30:06.847 --> 30:07.931
<i>Lose your job to a robot?</i>

30:07.932 --> 30:09.015
Oh, Jesus.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.767
<i>Check not come?</i>

30:10.768 --> 30:12.310
<i>Car break down?</i>

30:12.311 --> 30:14.563
<i>Whatever it is, we're here.</i>

30:15.314 --> 30:19.108
<i>We won't embarrass you
by asking too many questions.</i>

30:19.109 --> 30:21.402
<i>We trust
we'll get our money back</i>

30:21.403 --> 30:22.696
<i>one way or another.</i>

30:24.365 --> 30:27.993
<i>Here at Payday Whenever,
we gotcha, and we'll getcha.</i>

30:29.995 --> 30:31.413
Come on, let's sit down.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.207
References?

30:37.670 --> 30:39.003
Hey, listen to this.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.965
"If you find yourself struggling
to procure repayment funds,

30:41.966 --> 30:43.967
"here are a few useful ideas.

30:43.968 --> 30:47.178
"Number four.
Personal intimacy contractor."

30:47.179 --> 30:48.973
That sound like ho-ing to you?

30:50.140 --> 30:52.267
She look like
she went into debt ho-ing.

30:52.268 --> 30:53.768
Look at that.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.270
Girl, these are bounties.

30:55.271 --> 30:57.021
- Is that legal?
-That can't be legal.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.108
There's still time. Get out.

31:00.109 --> 31:02.026
I wish he would leave us
the hell alone.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.362
You're wasting your lives.
You're two beautiful ladies.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.824
- Wasting our lives?
- Get out!

31:07.700 --> 31:08.700
Run!

31:08.701 --> 31:10.077
Number 47!

31:10.786 --> 31:11.786
Come on.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.371
- Forty-seven!
- We heard you.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.749
- The hell she yelling for?
- Jesus.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.585
- Forty-seven!
-We heard you, ma'am!

31:18.586 --> 31:20.421
Uh, well, walk faster.

31:22.131 --> 31:24.549
Yeah, so sorry I couldn't
get you another chair.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.551
They don't really like you
sitting down.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.219
Uh, look.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.096
W-Why you taking a picture?

31:30.097 --> 31:31.180
Just in case.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.473
So, you want a loan?

31:32.474 --> 31:33.558
- Yes. Thank you.
- Yes.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.059
My business associate here
has just

31:35.060 --> 31:36.644
- run into some unexpected...
-Okay.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.187
Occupation.

31:38.188 --> 31:39.439
Uh, I'm an artist.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.025
I paint. I do all mediums.

31:42.026 --> 31:44.902
That's like oil paint, nails,
houses, inner, outer.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.071
Little bit of makeup. I did
the MAC counter, but the back.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.281
- Yeah. Oh.
- It was some other shit,

31:48.282 --> 31:49.366
but I... I got far.

31:49.491 --> 31:51.618
Uh, I thought you gave loans
to anybody.

31:51.619 --> 31:54.120
Yeah, anybody
with some proof of income.

31:54.121 --> 31:57.206
I mean, do you have an invoice
for your...  ...art?

31:57.207 --> 31:59.250
- You don't got to be mean.
- I'll work with you.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.878
What about Uber? SSI? SSDI?

32:01.879 --> 32:04.922
What you mean,
like PPP or HBO or...

32:04.923 --> 32:08.009
Alimony? Child support?
We will take child support.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.011
No, no child, no ring.

32:10.012 --> 32:12.264
- I'm fuckboy-free.
-Mmm.

32:13.474 --> 32:15.850
- Now I am.
- Well, in that case, 48!

32:15.851 --> 32:17.853
- Okay, wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- 48!

32:18.604 --> 32:20.480
- Wait. Um...
- Uh-huh.

32:20.481 --> 32:23.609
- What are the interest rates?
-There.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.611
Damn. I thought that was
the year of establishment.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.529
Mm-mm.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.782
If you don't have the money
this month,

32:30.783 --> 32:33.076
you're not gonna have it
next month.

32:33.077 --> 32:35.370
- Get out.
- Ugh.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.455
- Is he here every day?
- Please!

32:37.456 --> 32:39.749
What did y'all do
to this nigga here?

32:39.750 --> 32:41.542
He is so negative.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.294
Do you want
the loan or not?

32:43.295 --> 32:44.962
I do work at a diner.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.173
I'm a waitress.
I make a steady paycheck.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.258
Okay, fine, yeah.
I'm gonna just need your I.D.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.927
so I can run your credit check.

32:50.928 --> 32:53.179
Full disclosure. My credit score
is currently a little...

32:53.180 --> 32:54.263
No, no, doesn't matter.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.140
As long as you have a job,
arms and a leg,

32:56.141 --> 32:57.725
the system will approve you.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.103
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

33:08.570 --> 33:09.655
Are you having a heart attack?

33:10.406 --> 33:12.365
- Oh, my God, ma'am.
-Are you okay?

33:12.366 --> 33:15.660
Are you? I've never seen
a credit score this low.

33:17.871 --> 33:20.123
- Well, I... you know, I...
- Oh, my God.

33:20.124 --> 33:21.499
When I went to business school

33:21.500 --> 33:23.334
- I had to get a loan, and...
- Look at it.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.669
I'm, you know,
trying to figure out

33:24.670 --> 33:25.795
how to make everything back.

33:25.796 --> 33:28.673
Oh, so bad.
This score is so bad.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.341
- I know, I know.
- You got problems.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.467
- Oh.
- You act like

33:31.468 --> 33:32.802
we in Beverly Hills
or somewhere.

33:32.803 --> 33:33.886
Girl, you in the hood, too.

33:33.887 --> 33:35.763
Listen, listen. I have an idea.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.473
What if we combine our scores?

33:37.474 --> 33:39.726
Her and I have been
living together for se--

33:39.727 --> 33:41.269
We've been together
for seven years.

33:41.270 --> 33:43.062
That's common-law marriage
in any other state.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.564
So we're trying to give you
an opportunity

33:44.565 --> 33:46.190
to embrace something innovative.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.192
-Oh, wow.
- Yes. Me and my wife...

33:48.193 --> 33:49.277
"Wife."

33:49.278 --> 33:50.903
...would like to get
a loan together.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.155
Lesbians.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.240
Congratulations.

33:54.241 --> 33:55.324
- Progressive.
- Yeah.

33:55.325 --> 33:57.076
Great for the company.
Great for us. It's a good look.

33:57.077 --> 33:58.786
No, no, no, no, no.
Not a chance.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.872
And you know what?
You guys are old.

34:00.873 --> 34:04.375
Way too old not to understand
how credit works.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.669
-What?
- Ladies, just get it together.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.295
- Sweetie, you get it together.
- "Get it together"?

34:08.297 --> 34:09.630
- Is that AAVE?
- You know what? Denied.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.174
Why are you
acting so uppity?

34:11.175 --> 34:12.382
You ain't nothing
but a hood rat.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.092
- Denied.
- Yeah. You're denied.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.178
- Denied.
- You're void. You're void.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.262
Denied.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.472
- Let's go.
- She gonna kick your ass.

34:17.473 --> 34:18.639
And I'm gonna let her.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.141
You lucky she holding me back.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.018
You gave me a good laugh, ma'am.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.103
We're above this.
We're above it.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.688
I'm so high, I'm in the sky.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.733
-  Oh, my God.
- I'm so blessed,

34:28.734 --> 34:30.025
I'm not stressed.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.944
- Beautiful, beautiful.
-Blessed.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.112
Beautiful couple.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.781
Don't ever eat
these chips again,

34:34.782 --> 34:37.074
because your breath stinks!
Come on!

34:37.074 --> 34:38.202
Oh. Wear deodorant.

34:38.786 --> 34:42.205
Oh. Uh, Just kidding.
I didn't flinch at all, boo.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.998
Number 48!

34:45.667 --> 34:46.668
Forty-eight!

34:47.628 --> 34:49.128
I don't even know
what we're gonna do next.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.838
Looks like
you made it out alive.

34:50.839 --> 34:51.964
Thank goodness.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.716
Y'all don't want to know
what happened to me.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.760
- No, we don't.
- My name is Lucky, by the way.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.471
Thank you.
We're gonna walk this way.

34:59.181 --> 35:00.182
Hey!

35:00.891 --> 35:02.099
Hey. Guess what?

35:02.100 --> 35:04.185
I had 15 loans with them.

35:04.186 --> 35:06.188
Fifteen! I finally just gave up.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.983
No need to workin' a job.
They garnish all your wages.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.108
- Damn.
- Right.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.361
They hunt you, literally.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.655
It's perverse.

35:15.906 --> 35:16.906
I mean, are you sure

35:16.907 --> 35:18.074
you should be
driving after that hit?

35:18.075 --> 35:20.535
Why don't we just chill? I...

35:20.536 --> 35:23.955
Nigga, I got knocked on my ass
in front of everybody.

35:23.956 --> 35:25.665
'Cause of these bitches.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.543
Nah. Text them hoes.

35:28.335 --> 35:29.837
Find out where they went.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.551
{\an8}How much are we talking
exactly per pint?

35:36.552 --> 35:38.636
Well, we actually can pay you
$70 per pint,

35:38.637 --> 35:41.722
and you gonna get an apple pie
voucher for Church's Chicken.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.225
- Apple pie?
- Hell, yes.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.435
Okay. $140. That's a start.

35:46.270 --> 35:47.395
- You had me at "pie."
- All right, now,

35:47.396 --> 35:48.688
we can only take
one of you at a time,

35:48.689 --> 35:50.064
so which one is going first?

35:53.235 --> 35:55.236
I'm tough.

35:55.237 --> 35:56.947
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, sign right there, sis.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.411
Take it easy on me here.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.288
Needles make me
a little squeamish.

36:05.289 --> 36:07.832
Join the club, girl.
Today's my first day.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.418
But we gonna get through it.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.795
Okay, look, it's fine.
Just focus.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.590
Breathe.

36:15.591 --> 36:16.841
Focus on the money.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.301
- Nothing matters...
- The money.

36:18.302 --> 36:20.511
- ...but the money.
- But the money.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.596
But the money.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.853
Girl, no.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.229
Girl, fuck Keshawn.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.107
His ass on "read."

36:32.649 --> 36:35.026
Anyway,
after all of this is over,

36:35.027 --> 36:36.485
we gonna get
Hot Cheeto martinis.

36:36.486 --> 36:37.987
Not the Hot Cheeto martinis.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.071
Ow, fuck!

36:39.072 --> 36:40.615
Oh. Ooh.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.074
Let me try that again.

36:42.075 --> 36:44.785
- Uh...
- Just breathe.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.788
Breathe.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.832
I did it.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.626
I did it.

36:51.627 --> 36:54.629
Ooh! Okay.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.964
Now we gonna
just let it do its thing,

36:56.965 --> 36:59.091
and I'll be back in 30 minutes.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.136
You're not even taping it right.
What was your previous job?

37:02.262 --> 37:04.430
Stripper.

37:04.431 --> 37:07.183
- Anyway... Are you okay?
- I hate that lady.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.602
I'm asking because there's
a very comfy lounge chair.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.520
Go.

37:11.521 --> 37:14.190
I'll just be here, saving lives.

37:14.191 --> 37:17.402
Just imagine the money.
Dream of it. With every drop.

37:22.616 --> 37:23.617
Ooh.

37:32.876 --> 37:36.129
Please, Father God,
let this next one be rich...

37:38.632 --> 37:40.341
He look like
he like his mama too much.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.927
Skin too shiny. Ooh.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.888
Okay, glasses. I like that.

37:46.598 --> 37:47.598
Okay...

37:47.599 --> 37:50.352
If I donate more blood,
will I get more money?

37:54.940 --> 37:55.941
Do it.

38:11.748 --> 38:12.915
Oh, my God.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.835
Still alive.

38:15.961 --> 38:16.962
Still alive?

38:19.297 --> 38:20.297
The fuck?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.382
You could get more money,

38:21.383 --> 38:22.592
but I don't think
you got more blood.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.803
I gave four bags.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.097
- Come on, dummy!
- I told her on not to do it.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.223
Get this shit out of her.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.975
Wait, what are you...
Oh, my God!

38:30.976 --> 38:32.226
Oh, God.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.812
Put that back!
Ugh, it's in my mouth!

38:34.813 --> 38:37.189
- Girl. Unsanitary!
- Oh, my God!

38:37.190 --> 38:39.358
Will you...

38:39.359 --> 38:41.110
My bags!

38:41.111 --> 38:43.362
This my first day.
You gonna get me fired!

38:43.363 --> 38:45.031
You should've been fired!

38:45.032 --> 38:47.491
I was planning on
wearing this wig tonight!

38:47.492 --> 38:48.577
What the...

38:49.786 --> 38:50.829
What happened in here?

38:52.164 --> 38:53.456
Do we still get the money?

38:53.457 --> 38:55.207
No blood, no money, but...

38:55.208 --> 38:56.459
I can give you

38:56.460 --> 38:58.586
- these apple pie vouchers.
- Vouchers?

38:58.587 --> 38:59.671
And also,

38:59.796 --> 39:01.589
there's a clothes donation box
outside in the hallway.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.007
You look like you need it.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.341
Thank you.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.761
Do I still have a job?

39:12.726 --> 39:13.727
{\an8}Oh, my God.

39:21.485 --> 39:23.819
"Water pipes busted.
Use drive-through."

39:23.820 --> 39:26.573
If it ain't one thing,
it's another.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.538
Hello?

39:35.916 --> 39:36.916
Hello!

39:36.917 --> 39:38.375
<i>Yo,
who are you yelling at?</i>

39:38.376 --> 39:40.879
<i>Uh, welcome to Church's Chicken.
How can I help you?</i>

39:42.089 --> 39:45.508
We have these apple pie vouchers
and since we can't go inside,

39:45.509 --> 39:48.803

honey butter biscuits instead,

39:48.804 --> 39:50.054

39:52.224 --> 39:54.475

But walk normal.

40:26.049 --> 40:28.175

43:03.248 --> 43:05.457
You need to relax

43:07.252 --> 43:08.919

43:13.341 --> 43:15.217
It's just something that we
used to say when we were kids.

43:15.218 --> 43:16.385
We thought it would give us
liquid courage,

43:16.386 --> 43:17.761
but we actually
have never done it.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.722
- Take care of my friend.
- Uh, will do.

43:19.723 --> 43:22.182
I have no idea
where she's going.

43:22.183 --> 43:24.144
Yeah, she seemed turnt up.

43:43.455 --> 43:44.706
Look, I'm on the way.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.917
Hey, man, I got to make a move.
Put your seat belt on real fast.

Hot-ass messes.

43:54.215 --> 43:55.966
Sorry. I don't mean to

43:55.967 --> 43:59.678
It's cool. I mean, we're

Excuse you.

44:02.015 --> 44:03.725

44:04.976 --> 44:07.686
A little apple pie,

44:11.816 --> 44:14.152
Second cousins, twice removed.

44:16.154 --> 44:17.572

44:34.547 --> 44:37.509
So, uh, why do

44:39.552 --> 44:41.846
You seem pretty calm to me.

44:44.891 --> 44:46.518
I used to be real turnt up.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.937
Just doing a bunch of dumb shit.

44:50.355 --> 44:52.690
How turnt up,
on a scale from one to prison?

44:55.026 --> 44:57.821
Nah. I ain't never go to prison.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.449
I did some time in juvie, though.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.662
Like, juvenile hall?

45:08.039 --> 45:09.249
It ain't that bad.

45:10.291 --> 45:11.291
Yeah.

45:11.292 --> 45:13.377
Yeah, they sent me over there,
and then...

45:14.546 --> 45:17.256
Then they transferred me
out to this-this program...

45:17.257 --> 45:18.466
Hey, you want to get that?

45:21.511 --> 45:23.220

<i>- She's with her man.</i>

45:31.146 --> 45:32.563

Your friend, if you don't get

But where are y'all at?

45:37.610 --> 45:39.069
<i>West and 54th.</i>

45:39.070 --> 45:41.530
But you ain't heard that

45:41.531 --> 45:43.949
All right. You could
drop me off somewhere?

45:43.950 --> 45:46.201
- Everything good?
- I don't know.

45:46.202 --> 45:47.287
Say less.

45:48.788 --> 45:50.873
<i>Welcome to Church's
Chicken. What can I get you?</i>

45:50.874 --> 45:53.000
Yeah. Did two girls

45:55.462 --> 45:57.212
<i>I mean,

46:00.091 --> 46:01.383
You see where they went?

46:01.384 --> 46:03.594
<i>I mean, if I was
telling people's business</i>

46:03.595 --> 46:04.928
<i>instead of standing on it,</i>

46:04.929 --> 46:08.015
<i>I'd be like, "They hopped
in a black Mercedes and dipped."</i>

46:08.016 --> 46:10.268
<i>But that's if I was telling
people's business, though.</i>

46:11.686 --> 46:12.686
Hey, hey.

46:12.687 --> 46:15.856
I mean, long as we're here, we
might as well order something.

46:15.857 --> 46:18.109
You know, keep our minds sharp.

And some jal-a-peno bombers.

46:32.916 --> 46:35.542
<i>It's "jalapeño." It's like
you hollering at the peño.</i>

46:35.543 --> 46:36.628

46:37.545 --> 46:38.754
Yeah, hey,
don't forget to ask for the...

46:38.755 --> 46:39.838
Honey butter biscuits in there?

46:39.839 --> 46:41.423
Got that honey butter biscuit, man.

46:41.424 --> 46:43.634

Thank you.

Hey, Dreux!

47:22.173 --> 47:23.924
It ain't worth it!

47:23.925 --> 47:26.635
Alyssa, what the hell is you

47:26.636 --> 47:28.303
I'mma go see if somebody

47:28.304 --> 47:30.305
Somebody threw some
retro Jordans up here, bitch.

47:30.306 --> 47:31.640
You know how much that's worth?

47:31.641 --> 47:33.016
- Look.
-So what?

47:33.017 --> 47:34.685
You about to die. Get down!

47:34.686 --> 47:37.062
Cover up.
Your lady bits are showing.

47:37.063 --> 47:38.730
Lucky, how the hell
did she get up there?

47:38.731 --> 47:40.899
- I'mma have to go get her.
- No, don't do that.

47:40.900 --> 47:42.943
I done seen
fat squirrels fry up there.

47:42.944 --> 47:44.611
We're both just too big for it.

47:45.947 --> 47:47.030
Shit, shit, shit.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.782
This is King Lolo's hood.

47:48.783 --> 47:50.742
You don't want them kind
of problems.

47:50.743 --> 47:53.704
He ain't gonna miss some random
pair of shoes on a power line.

47:53.705 --> 47:56.331
I'm just saying,
he ain't screwed too tight.

47:56.332 --> 47:57.416
Take heed!

47:57.417 --> 47:59.835
He the one that threw 'em
up here. He must ain't want 'em.

47:59.836 --> 48:01.044
Alyssa, be careful!

48:01.045 --> 48:02.713
You take heed.

48:02.714 --> 48:04.172
Somebody take heed.

48:04.173 --> 48:05.674
Heed is not being taken.

48:07.093 --> 48:08.177
Catch.

48:08.845 --> 48:10.762
Got it.

48:10.763 --> 48:13.015

-Oh, shit.

48:13.016 --> 48:15.517
Bitch, you about
to get electrocuted!

48:15.518 --> 48:18.229
It's gonna be shea butter smell
all over the hood.

48:23.443 --> 48:24.901
Someone call 911.

48:24.902 --> 48:25.986
Oh! Hell, no!

48:25.987 --> 48:28.698
She didn't take heed.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.043
Oh, my God,
I thought I killed you.

48:41.044 --> 48:42.336
All right, don't be mad,

48:42.337 --> 48:44.339
but you passed out
and I panicked.

48:47.008 --> 48:49.217
Bitch, are we in an ambulance?

48:49.218 --> 48:50.927
That's a $2,000 bill.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.012
We got to get the hell up
out of here.

48:52.013 --> 48:53.138
- Ma'am.
- We're not jumping out

48:53.139 --> 48:54.264
of a moving vehicle.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.017
Ma'am,
can you please lay back down?

49:01.147 --> 49:02.357
It's not moving now.

49:02.815 --> 49:03.815
- Come on!
- Ma'am. Ma'am.

49:03.816 --> 49:04.900
God.

49:04.901 --> 49:05.984
- Hey!

49:05.985 --> 49:07.986
Ma'am, we're trying to help you!

49:07.987 --> 49:11.366
We have your information.
We know where to send the bill.

49:17.163 --> 49:18.830
We already took you halfway.

49:25.672 --> 49:28.799
I need a gym membership
and a better shirt.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.175
Girl, I thought you was a goner.

49:30.176 --> 49:32.052
You have no idea
how scary that was.

49:32.053 --> 49:34.137
You'll never be able
to get rid of me, bitch.

49:34.138 --> 49:35.389
Even if I was dead.

49:35.390 --> 49:36.473
You gonna haunt me?

49:36.474 --> 49:38.141
You know I can't go full-time
on the afterlife.

49:38.142 --> 49:39.851
I got to go half and half,
back and forth.

49:39.852 --> 49:42.104
- A little hippity-hop?
- Anyway, wait till I flip these.

49:42.105 --> 49:44.106
Girl, don't nobody want
them dusty-ass J's.

49:44.107 --> 49:46.609
They tore up from the floor up.

49:47.193 --> 49:48.193
Fuck all that.

49:48.194 --> 49:50.196
Look at how much we're
gonna make on these shoes.

49:52.615 --> 49:53.615
Is that for real?

49:53.616 --> 49:56.326
- Are you with me now?
- How do you even know that?

49:56.327 --> 49:58.537
Because Keshawn
is obsessed with Jordans.

49:58.538 --> 50:00.455
Keshawn is obsessed with
everything but having a home.

50:00.456 --> 50:03.166
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry

50:03.167 --> 50:04.543
for all this Keshawn shit.

50:04.544 --> 50:06.378
I know it is all my fault.

50:06.379 --> 50:08.255
- Believe me.
- It is what it is.

50:08.256 --> 50:10.465
We are in this together
and, uh...

50:10.466 --> 50:12.634
and let's go sell these shoes
and get this money.

50:12.635 --> 50:13.719
Yes.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.095
Damn, Dorothy!

50:15.096 --> 50:17.180
Shit like that's
got asbestos in it.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.965
"And a symbol
of the neighborhood

50:51.966 --> 50:53.550
in which they originate."

50:53.551 --> 50:55.052
How much you think?

50:56.971 --> 50:58.805
- Go big or go home.
- Exactly.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.515
That's what I was thinking.

51:00.516 --> 51:03.603
- 2,500.
-2,500.

51:04.270 --> 51:05.271
What?

51:07.982 --> 51:09.941
It's coming.
I got a good feeling about this.

51:09.942 --> 51:11.234
Yeah, you always got
a good feeling.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.153
Was I not right about Maniac?

51:13.154 --> 51:14.362
Maniac.

51:14.363 --> 51:16.198
Did he see everything
that went down?

51:16.199 --> 51:17.824
Oh, my God, I didn't even get
a chance to tell you, girl.

51:17.825 --> 51:19.451
He took control
of the whole situation.

51:19.452 --> 51:21.953
He called 911.
He knew all the EMTs by name.

51:21.954 --> 51:23.121
It's like,
I knew he was gangsta,

51:23.122 --> 51:25.040
but how many people
do you have to shoot

51:25.041 --> 51:26.458
to know the EMTs by name?

51:30.129 --> 51:31.129
We got a buyer.

51:31.130 --> 51:33.632
And he's willing
to pay full price!

51:33.633 --> 51:35.008
Let's fucking go!

51:35.009 --> 51:36.384
Let's go! I told you!

51:36.385 --> 51:38.887
Girl, calm... calm down. Okay?
Because it's 2:55 right now,

51:38.888 --> 51:40.555
I got to go
to my interview at 4:00,

51:40.556 --> 51:42.057
and we got to get this money
to Uche by 6:00.

51:42.058 --> 51:43.266
Nah, we straight. We got it.

51:43.267 --> 51:44.976
Tell him to meet us right now
or the deal's off.

51:44.977 --> 51:46.646
Cash only, Jim Gilliam Park.

51:47.814 --> 51:50.148
Yes. Who are you,
Franklin Saint?

51:50.149 --> 51:52.609
Ancestors, come through.
Ancestors, come through.

51:52.610 --> 51:56.112
All right. He said, "Cool."
Cool.

51:56.113 --> 51:58.448
Let's get it, do it!

51:58.449 --> 51:59.908
- Go!
- Yeah!

51:59.909 --> 52:01.952
- Don't doubt me ever again.
- Oh, my gosh. Oh. W-W-Wait.

52:01.953 --> 52:04.329
He could be a murderer.
This is the Internet.

52:04.330 --> 52:06.456
So I'll do the deal, and you
just stand by in the distance

52:06.457 --> 52:07.874
and watch and make sure
everything's okay.

52:07.875 --> 52:08.959
I will pack that nigga out.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.086
- I got you.
- Okay.

52:11.504 --> 52:12.713
Yeah.

52:15.258 --> 52:17.050
So you say your father
wore these, right?

52:17.051 --> 52:18.343
Yes. Yes, sir.

52:18.344 --> 52:20.387
Yeah, he wore 'em every day.

52:20.388 --> 52:22.764
That's why they've got
the lived-in aesthetic.

52:22.765 --> 52:23.850
I like that.

52:24.809 --> 52:26.227
I like that a lot. Okay.

52:27.395 --> 52:29.689
Hmm. I could see that, too.

52:32.024 --> 52:33.108
What was his name?

52:33.109 --> 52:34.192
My dad?

52:34.193 --> 52:35.902
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh...

52:35.903 --> 52:38.280
Name was Cornelius.
Do you want these or...

52:38.281 --> 52:39.823
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:39.824 --> 52:43.410
You said your dad name
"was Cornelius."

52:43.411 --> 52:44.495
What...

52:45.413 --> 52:46.413
What happened?

52:46.414 --> 52:49.040
Uh... A-A boating accident.

52:49.041 --> 52:50.667
Your father had a boat accident?

52:50.668 --> 52:52.127
I'm actually on a bit
of a time crunch, so if you...

52:52.128 --> 52:53.920
What you mean, Cornelius got
into a boat accident?

52:53.921 --> 52:56.089
- What? What?
- Let me hook you up real quick.

52:56.090 --> 52:58.383
Get you the real treatment, man.

52:58.384 --> 53:00.386
We just need to, boom,
put your foot. Come on. Mm-hmm.

53:01.012 --> 53:03.764
Whoo! Now,
that went in like butter.

53:04.515 --> 53:06.766
So clean but dirty
'cause it's vintage!

53:06.767 --> 53:08.435
So, what you got?
What you gonna do?

53:14.150 --> 53:15.610
- Are you crying?
- It's just,

53:16.444 --> 53:18.361
when I see these and you telling

53:18.362 --> 53:21.741
a story about your dad
Cornelius, it just...

53:23.117 --> 53:24.701
But you don't know him.

53:24.702 --> 53:26.161
You don't know the man.

53:26.162 --> 53:28.247
Just reminds me of...

53:29.415 --> 53:31.417
- Hey, man.
- ...of my father 'cause...

53:32.418 --> 53:34.420
Your father had a incident
on a boat.

53:35.504 --> 53:39.633
So did... So did my father
and my grandfather,

53:39.634 --> 53:42.385
and my great-grandfather,
you know, proverbially speaking.

53:42.386 --> 53:43.470
I know.

53:43.471 --> 53:45.221
No, you don't know.
I'm talking about slavery!

53:45.222 --> 53:47.223
We done been through
a lot, brother.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.308
Yes, we have.

53:48.309 --> 53:49.893
So, how about this?

53:49.894 --> 53:52.604
You take 'em today,
I give 'em to you for 15.

53:52.605 --> 53:54.607
Perfect. Deal.

53:55.441 --> 53:56.441
Motherfucker.

53:56.442 --> 53:58.360
Yeah.

53:58.361 --> 54:00.028
I tricked your ass.

54:00.029 --> 54:02.238
Girl, I can't believe
this worked.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.199
You literally got some
dusty shoes off a pole,

54:04.200 --> 54:06.368
and we used it to make rent?
I mean, what?

54:06.369 --> 54:07.619
We probably could've got more,

54:07.620 --> 54:09.621
but, you know,
I messed it up at the end.

54:09.622 --> 54:11.122
But that nigga started crying,
and you know men look

54:11.123 --> 54:12.582
so ugly when they cry,
so I just cracked.

54:12.583 --> 54:13.833
We could've been homeless,
and now we not.

54:13.834 --> 54:14.960
Now we not.

54:14.961 --> 54:17.003
Just like that.
Life is looking up for us.

54:17.004 --> 54:18.505
You got to claim it.
You gonna get a promotion.

54:18.506 --> 54:19.589
We is not broke.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.383
We gonna live in abundance.

54:21.384 --> 54:23.843
Girl, we can't get this check.

54:23.844 --> 54:25.178
It's 3:30. I-I got to get ready.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.513
I got to get dressed.
I got to change.

54:26.514 --> 54:28.098
No, fuck all that. You don't
have time for any of that.

54:28.099 --> 54:29.224
You need to roll
with this energy right here.

54:29.225 --> 54:30.308
It's fine. You look great.

54:30.309 --> 54:31.434
Girl, I can't go in there
looking like

54:31.435 --> 54:32.560
a thick praying mantis.

54:32.561 --> 54:35.146
You look like all this money
in my hand and in my pocket.

54:35.147 --> 54:36.231
You look like a ball of light.

{\an8}Hello. I'll be right back.

55:57.772 --> 55:59.397
Hi, I'm Dreux Jones.

55:59.398 --> 56:01.775
- I'm here for the interview.
- Oh. Oh, yes.

56:01.776 --> 56:03.151
Perfect timing.

56:03.152 --> 56:04.694
If you'll follow me,
I can lead you back.

56:04.695 --> 56:05.780
Cool.

56:14.622 --> 56:16.164
Go ahead and have a seat.

56:16.165 --> 56:18.583
Shayla and Norman
are on their way.

56:18.584 --> 56:20.877
Uh, can I get you anything?
Water? Coffee?

56:20.878 --> 56:22.171
I'm okay. Thank you.

56:35.184 --> 56:36.768
Hi. Drex?

56:36.769 --> 56:38.228
Uh, it's actually Dreux.

56:38.229 --> 56:40.230
Oh. Dreux, with an "X."

56:40.231 --> 56:41.816
- Yeah.
-  Okay.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.861
- That's a new one.
-  Yeah. You know...

56:45.986 --> 56:48.030
Parents didn't make it easy
on you, did they?

56:50.282 --> 56:54.619
Hi, so, so sorry I am late.
I had to finish up a call.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.996
- Hi.
- I'm Shayla. Nice to meet you.

56:56.997 --> 56:58.707
Wonderful to meet you, too.

57:00.334 --> 57:01.335
<i>Hola, señorita.</i>

57:02.002 --> 57:03.711
Shit, I see you.

57:03.712 --> 57:06.549
You got all the fruits.

57:07.258 --> 57:09.635
How you say "papaya" in Spanish?

57:10.511 --> 57:11.511
<i>Papaya.</i>

57:11.512 --> 57:13.555
Okay. Let me get
a little bit of everything.

57:13.556 --> 57:15.014
You want Tajín and chamoy?

57:15.015 --> 57:16.641
The lime. All of that, please.

57:16.642 --> 57:17.976
And do you want
a small or large?

57:17.977 --> 57:21.729
I only have enough
for the little one,

57:21.730 --> 57:24.024
but I really want the big one.

57:26.902 --> 57:29.904
So, I researched
the qualifications on LinkedIn

57:29.905 --> 57:32.574
just to see
where I could stand out. Um...

57:32.575 --> 57:35.660
Pretty much anything
you can think of, I've done it.

57:35.661 --> 57:36.995
Top to bottom.

57:36.996 --> 57:39.164
And I'm not saying
that I know everything,

57:39.165 --> 57:41.499
but I do think that
I have the right ingredients

57:41.500 --> 57:44.545
to succeed here.
With you guys' help, of course.

57:46.088 --> 57:49.299
You know, I actually was
a waitress here, too.

57:49.300 --> 57:52.385
- You used to wear the Dickies?
- Oh, I wore the Dickies.

57:53.804 --> 57:54.971
Yeah, I graduated,

57:54.972 --> 57:57.599
I couldn't find a fancy job,
so I bussed tables.

57:57.600 --> 58:00.810
In college, I was a line cook
at Denny's. Don't tell anyone.

58:02.021 --> 58:05.148
Okay, so, Dreux, you have all
of the restaurant experience.

58:05.149 --> 58:07.358
In fact, you are
one of the most experienced

58:07.359 --> 58:09.987
out of all of our applicants,
but...

58:10.738 --> 58:14.783
I want to know more about
who Dreux is, okay?

58:15.659 --> 58:17.745
What separates you
from your competitors?

58:19.246 --> 58:20.247
I'm dedicated.

58:21.582 --> 58:25.586
I care about my customers,
and I-I treat them like family.

58:26.670 --> 58:27.795
I want them to feel like

58:27.796 --> 58:29.256
they're having dinner
with a loved one...

58:30.132 --> 58:31.132
named Norm.

58:31.133 --> 58:33.010
Uncle Norm.

58:34.178 --> 58:35.386
I work hard.

58:35.387 --> 58:36.679
And I won't give up.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.098
I'll be a great
franchise manager.

58:39.099 --> 58:40.517
Here's the little one.

58:41.185 --> 58:42.978
- Hmm.
<i>- Muchas gracias.</i>

58:43.729 --> 58:44.939
<i>Gracias.</i> Thank you.

58:51.320 --> 58:54.281
Thirsty-ass nigga,
get off my phone.

58:57.952 --> 58:59.702
Let me show you
a nigga with a job.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.329
Excuse me. Can you take
a picture with me, please,

59:01.330 --> 59:02.413
real quick?

59:02.414 --> 59:04.208
- Uh, okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

59:06.168 --> 59:08.628
- Uh, where would you like me...
- Two seconds. Hold this.

59:08.629 --> 59:10.005
- Uh, oh. Oh.
- Thank you.

59:14.635 --> 59:16.511
- Say <i>"queso."
- Queso.</i>

59:16.512 --> 59:17.971
Like you mean it.

59:17.972 --> 59:19.682
<i>- Queso.</i>
<i>- Dame más.</i>

59:28.315 --> 59:29.316
Um...

59:30.067 --> 59:32.735
She just
hit me back.

59:32.736 --> 59:34.279
She did?

59:34.280 --> 59:35.364
Where is she?

59:36.865 --> 59:39.076
- I can't... I don't...
- Give me the fucking...

59:41.370 --> 59:43.580
Hmm. I know where that is.

59:45.958 --> 59:47.251
Slow down!

59:48.335 --> 59:50.920
And since we're
on the subject of mainstays,

59:50.921 --> 59:53.424
you know what we have
to talk about, don't you?

59:54.008 --> 59:55.967
- The church crowd.
- The church crowd!

59:57.428 --> 01:00:00.346
- Why are they so mean?
- Okay?

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:02.015
The spirit of the Lord
should be all over them.

01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:03.391
I mean, come on, Esther.
You just came from church.

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:04.892
We do our best business
on Sundays.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:05.977
Let's cut 'em some slack.

01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:07.562
And it's really because
they're hangry,

01:00:07.563 --> 01:00:08.938
especially the Baptists.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.940
I mean, they in there surviving
on crackers and grape juice.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.650
It's not enough.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.320
They actually need
a special Sunday menu.

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:16.780
It's what I'm thinking.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.197
Hmm.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:20.283
Thank you, Victor.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:22.202
- Of course.
- I'mma call you.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:25.079
Can you
text me those pictures?

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.332
You didn't think you was gonna
see me again, huh, little bitch?

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:29.418
No. Berniece.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:35.298
- Well, this has been fun, Dreux.
- Thank you so much.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:36.716
Now, we do have other applicants

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:38.259
that we need
to interview, but...

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.678
I think I can speak
for everyone when I say

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:42.138
that you are definitely
the type of candidate

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.599
that we have always had in mind
when we designed this program.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.225
- Yay!
-  Okay?

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:47.810
- So, for next steps...
-...fuck you up,

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.354
- dirty bitch!
- Uh... Huh.

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:51.773
You remember me?
You knew when you was

01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:54.067
- in my motherfucking house.
-Did you see that?

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:55.943
Gosh, crime has gotten
so bad here.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:58.946
Uh, yeah.
It's really on the rise.

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:00.198
You were saying

01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:01.741
- about the next steps?
-Dreux!

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:03.326
-Uh, are...
- I'll fuck you up!

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.661
-Dreux! I need help!
- D-Don't resist!

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.663
- Are they with you?
- What?

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:08.748
-Dreux!
- No. No.

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:10.458
I've never seen those people
in my life.

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:12.251
Dreux, can you hear me?

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.837
- Help!
-No, don't resist!

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.590
- I...
-Dreux!

01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:20.636
I'm sorry.

01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:24.597
Oh.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:26.099
Don't you ever bring your ass

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.142
to my motherfucking house,
stanky!

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:30.104
- Hey, get off her. Get off her!
- Get off me, bitch!

01:01:30.813 --> 01:01:31.813
Get off me, ho!

01:01:31.814 --> 01:01:33.481
- Hey! I'm ready.
- You hos want to...

01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:35.109
- You hos want to get beat?
- Hit me! Hit me!

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:51.834
Yes!

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:53.668
Bitch!

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:58.757
Oh, y'all hos got some money.

01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:01.843
Yeah, we gonna
call this interest

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:05.304
for all the bullshit you bitches
put me through today.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.014
And I better not catch y'all
on my block.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.100
No, no, no, no, no.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:10.561
The money.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:15.690
Not bad, y'all.

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:17.067
Keshawn,
bring your ass!

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:23.532
Shayla. Shayla!

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:29.954
Wait, wait.

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.290
I know how this looks,

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:34.125
but I can promise you
I'm not like that.

01:02:34.126 --> 01:02:36.752
Okay, Dreux, you...
You need to leave.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:40.256
No, just please let me explain.
I had a crazy day. My...

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.632
I tried to sell this man
some shoes,

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:42.717
and my girl got electrocuted.

01:02:42.718 --> 01:02:44.218
We had to jump out
of a ambulance.

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:48.765
Okay, clearly, you are not
the girl we are looking for.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.241
I don't get it. I don't get it.

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:08.868
I feel like I'm hanging on
by my fingernails,

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:11.537
and every time I think
I got some momentum, it's...

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.456
I mean, how did they even know
we was here?

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.750
Like, what the fuck?

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.463
Dreux, I...

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:21.590
- Dreux...
- Nah.

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:23.633
- No.
-I...

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.009
Alyssa, tell me

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.636
it was the universe
that brought them to us.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:27.970
Tell me it was kismet

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.514
or whatever the fuck
you be talking about.

01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:31.015
Tell me it was anything
other than the fact

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.517
that you talked to Keshawn.

01:03:32.518 --> 01:03:35.061
No, it wasn't like that. I swear
to God it wasn't like that.

01:03:35.062 --> 01:03:36.395
- I swear to God.
- God.

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:38.773
- Listen.
- Do you do it on purpose?

01:03:38.774 --> 01:03:40.859
Just tell me,
do you do it on purpose?

01:03:42.778 --> 01:03:44.362
Seriously, you're a dumbass.

01:03:44.363 --> 01:03:46.072
And you and Keshawn
deserve each other

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:47.198
because y'all are
good for nothing

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:48.324
other than fucking up my life.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.994
That's how you feel?
I'm glad you finally said it.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.329
Here you go, trying to deflect.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.081
Typical Alyssa.
Take some responsibility.

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:57.083
No, you take
some responsibility.

01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:58.876
I know exactly
who the fuck I am.

01:03:58.877 --> 01:03:59.961
I know all my shortcomings.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.128
I never blamed you
for any of them.

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:02.630
What's that supposed to mean?

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:05.216
It means it's not my fault
you hate your fucking life.

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:06.842
It's not my fault

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.344
shit didn't turn out
the way you wanted it to.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:09.638
You plan everything.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:11.681
I waste so much energy

01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:13.599
trying to make you feel better
about yourself.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.893
"Come on, Dreux."
"Believe in yourself, Dreux."

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:18.313
"Fix your hair, Dreux."
You still at a fucking diner.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.108
Least I have a fucking plan.

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.278
You don't have a real job!

01:04:24.987 --> 01:04:26.571
You-You saved in a ho phone.

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:27.905
You chasing around a nigga

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:30.616
that care more about his
fucking shoes than he do you.

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:32.618
He don't love you,
he don't like you,

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.620
and he sure as hell
don't respect you.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.540
Your life is a fucking joke.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:44.965
Go ahead, answer it.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.466
You already
fucked up everything.

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:49.051
You might as well get
dicked down for the trouble.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.386
Fuck you.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.512
Hello?

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:52.847
<i>You still got them J's for sale?</i>

01:04:52.848 --> 01:04:53.932
No, I'm fresh out.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.600
When I get another pair,
you'll be the first to know.

01:04:55.601 --> 01:04:58.102
<i>Then we got a problem.
See, those was my shoes.</i>

01:04:58.103 --> 01:04:59.186
Who is this?

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:00.689
Lolo.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:02.649
It's King Lolo.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.735
<i>- Nah, nah, don't get quiet now.</i>
- Turn it up, turn it up.

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:07.820
Oh, sorry. We're here,
we're here. Um...

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:09.864
We're sorry.
We didn't know it was you.

01:05:09.865 --> 01:05:11.324
Hey.

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:13.117
Shit happens, right?
How about this?

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:16.037
How about y'all pay me
market price, we call it even?

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:17.789
That's all right.
That's cool, that's cool.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.957
Fantastic.
Five racks.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.584
$5,000?

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.794
<i>Let's say 10:00 tonight.</i>

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:26.047
<i>You and Dreux
in The Jungles, right?</i>

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.467
<i>What'd I say
about getting quiet?</i>

01:05:29.468 --> 01:05:31.302
Yeah, sorry. Yes. Yes.

01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:32.762
<i>Perfect. Tonight.</i>

01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:34.555
<i>10:00 p.m., five racks.</i>

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:37.183
- I'd have it if I was you.
-No, no! No!

01:05:37.184 --> 01:05:38.267
No, no!

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.602
Pull me back up.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:40.686
No, man.

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.021
Pull me back, man.

01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:43.981
- No, don't, please! Please!
-Drop him!

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:49.279
Wow. Now we're going to die.

01:05:58.747 --> 01:05:59.955
You going the wrong way.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.374
There's a fucking crosswalk, bitch.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:03.250
- Then get to it, bitch!
- Fuck you!

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:04.753
You ain't my type.

01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:16.450
Uche.

01:07:17.409 --> 01:07:18.410
Uche.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:21.787
Uche.

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:22.873
Really?

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:25.416
It's 6:32.

01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:26.584
So, what, you just cleared
everything out

01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:28.002
in the last 32 minutes?

01:07:28.003 --> 01:07:30.296
I made an educated guess.

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:31.631
Do you have the rent?

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.550
Looks like I was right.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.802
So you just gonna skip
the whole eviction process?

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.721
Rent is due on the first, Uche.

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:39.805
It's still the first.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:40.973
- This is illegal.
- Fine.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:43.893
If you can pay in full by 11:59,

01:07:43.894 --> 01:07:46.353
I will put everything
back inside myself.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:47.939
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.234
Uche, please. Please.

01:07:56.031 --> 01:07:57.449
This is fucked up!

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:03.038
Wow.

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:05.831
That was
great negotiating skills.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.374
Did you learn that
in business school?

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:08.877
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:11.670
So, what you gonna do?

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.547
Just sit here on your ass
like you always do?

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:15.883
Wait for King Lolo
to come and kill us?

01:08:15.884 --> 01:08:17.928
Yeah. I'mma die right here.
You go die over there.

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:24.934
{\an8}It shouldn't have
to be this hard.

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:26.185
Hey, guys.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.063
A-Are you having, like,
a yard sale or something?

01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:31.023
We sure are, Bethany.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:34.361
Oh. Mind if I, uh, take a peek?

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.238
Yeah, that's why
we're here, Bethany.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.285
Wow.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:45.537
This is amazing.

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:47.122
Uh, how much is this?

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:49.041
Oh, girl,
you could have that for free.

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.126
$300.

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:51.837
Done.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.298
Yeah, this is, um...
This is an original.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.925
Alyssa painted it herself.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:59.426
She actually painted
all of them.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:00.636
You painted this?

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.720
Yeah.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.349
- You're incredible.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:06.015
But I'm gonna need you
to sign it.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:07.393
Of course.

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:10.229
Every great artist
has to sign their work.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.438
Get over here, Alyssa.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.524
Sorry.

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:14.234
Thank you.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.657
Hey. Do you mind
if I tag you in this?

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.325
No. Go for it, please.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:26.412
I-I do brand management.
I run a couple of accounts.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.165
This is a lot of followers,
Bethany.

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:32.167
What do you say
about us doing that, uh,

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.170
"prosecco party
with your bitches" thing?

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:37.881
- Prosecco party with pals?
- Pa-- Prosecco party with pals.

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:39.216
-Yes.
- We're the pals!

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:40.594
Yes!

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:44.889
What do you guys
think about right here?

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:46.765
Uh, do we like the off-center?

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.559
Or is that too off-center?

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.768
I love it.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:51.270
Yeah.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.357
Did you do
the renovations here yourself?

01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:56.317
Oh, God, no.

01:09:56.318 --> 01:09:59.028
I don't even know
how to swing a hammer.

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:00.571
It looked like this
on the website.

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:03.324
And they even
offered me free dog treats.

01:10:03.325 --> 01:10:05.326
-Wow.
- And, uh, ADT for security.

01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:06.827
Mm-hmm.
By the way,

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:08.704
are you guys a little toasty,

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:11.583
or is it just me?
'Cause I can turn on the AC.

01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:13.626
Your AC works?

01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:14.793
Yours doesn't?

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.128
- Uh-uh.
-No.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:20.090
Not the AC, not the water.
The ceiling's falling.

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:21.717
I mean, the list goes on.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:23.219
Oh, I get it now.

01:10:24.596 --> 01:10:25.805
Uche's desperate.

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:27.806
Girl, what that mean?

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:29.642
I think he's having
money trouble.

01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:32.854
He-He's trying really hard
to get people to move in here.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.482
Hmm.

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:38.776
Speaking of people
with money, uh,

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:41.528
we're actually
having a, um, art show tonight.

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:43.072
You mind posting that
for us, too?

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:44.323
Tonight?

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:45.741
Mm. It's a pop-up!

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.242
What y'all call it.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.619
Pop-up where?

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:51.038
Uh, right here,
in the courtyard.

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:52.206
For Alyssa's work?

01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:54.041
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
it's kind of a, like,

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:55.459
"if you know, you know"
kind of thing.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.420
Very members-only. Like...
"Shh, don't tell."

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.505
I have horrible FOMO.

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:00.798
- Can I come?
-Of course.

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:04.218
Yeah, yeah. Just make sure
you call all your art friends,

01:11:04.219 --> 01:11:06.595
the ones that come from
families with money, you know.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:07.680
-  Okay.
- Great.

01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:08.765
Bethany,

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:11.892
let me holler at my homegirl
real quick. Thank you.

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.852
And we'll be doing Cash App,
Venmo, everything.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:16.814
Girl, she got
crown molding, too.

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:19.024
- Ain't that a bitch?
- What are you doing?

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.901
Making lemonade!

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:22.987
Girl, if we get enough of these
hipster motherfuckers

01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:25.155
to buy your art, we'll be able
to probably pay back

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:26.991
that lunatic that's trying
to kill our ass tonight.

01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:28.200
Shit, we make it real big,

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.660
we're gonna be able to get
the apartment back, too.

01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:32.246
Just because
one person liked one painting?

01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:33.831
That doesn't mean anything.

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:35.332
The painting is good, Alyssa.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.710
All the paintings are good.
I've always told you that.

01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:41.296
I mean, how many times you
gonna tell me to see my worth?

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.881
Bitch, now it's you.

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:45.300
"You been her."
Remember?

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.303
Okay. I'm still pissed at you,
but that was sweet.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:49.471
I'm pissed at you.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.932
Okay, well, after today, you
never have to see me again.

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:53.017
Good!

01:11:53.018 --> 01:11:54.852
So we do this party,
sell this art,

01:11:54.853 --> 01:11:58.313
get this money, don't die,
and we're done.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.398
{\an8}Three hours.

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:03.527
Three hours, bitch.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:01.878
Yeah, that's it.

01:13:05.757 --> 01:13:07.216
All right, baby girl,
this is about as good as

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:09.469
- it's gonna get in 15 minutes.
- Okay, let me see. Oh!

01:13:10.637 --> 01:13:11.804
You ate that.

01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:12.930
- I like it.
- Yeah.

01:13:12.931 --> 01:13:14.765
- Got to say, I like it.
- Yeah, I did.

01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:29.864
Hey, this chili right here, boy.

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:35.453
Wow.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:37.539
How much for that one?

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:39.289
650.

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.375
Cool.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:49.633
And we will have that wrapped up
for you in a little bit.

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:50.718
Sweet.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:57.809
Sh...

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.355
Dreux?

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.403
- Hi, Shayla.
- Hey.

01:14:09.404 --> 01:14:11.656
- I thought that was you.
-  I live here.

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:14.700
Oh. Wow. That's crazy.

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:16.285
I actually grew up
in The Jungles.

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:17.704
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:21.374
So, this is your event?

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.375
Yeah.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.210
This is my best friend's work,
and I kind of...

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.004
kind of helped put
everything together, you know.

01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:28.089
Got the word out.

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:31.176
Yeah, well, you reached me.

01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:37.223
I want to say I'm really sorry
about everything that happened.

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:39.976
I feel ashamed and embarrassed.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.980
And I know we don't get these
kind of opportunities often.

01:14:45.273 --> 01:14:46.982
I just want you to know
that I really appreciate

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.735
and really admire everything
that you're trying to do.

01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:52.238
And I'm glad that
I even got considered.

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:56.993
Yeah, today was definitely
a hot mess.

01:14:57.702 --> 01:15:02.039
But, um, you really were
the best meeting we had.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.624
Like, seriously.

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:06.835
And...
losing fight aside...

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:11.798
I mean, just looking around at
this event you put together--

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:13.300
that is very impressive.

01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:15.887
So I think there would still be
a spot for you if you want it.

01:15:17.764 --> 01:15:18.805
What?

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:21.099
- Shayla, thank you so much.
-  Okay. Whoa, whoa.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.476
Oh, sorry.

01:15:22.477 --> 01:15:24.144
Personal space. You know.

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:26.230
It's okay. It is all good.

01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:29.525
Look, I'mma head out.
But I'mma call you next week.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.195
Okay? All right.

01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:36.823
Oh.

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:39.576
Lucky, where you been?
I've been looking for you.

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:42.454
What, you got a GPS tracker
on us or something?

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:44.706
No. I used to have
homing pigeons,

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.999
but they were homeless, too,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.335
so they kept flying around,
so...

01:15:48.336 --> 01:15:50.504
So let me guess...

01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:53.007
I'm not supposed
to be doing this, either.

01:15:53.675 --> 01:15:57.136
No, this is exactly what
you're supposed to be doing.

01:15:57.679 --> 01:15:59.012
I'm so proud of you.

01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:01.974
Like, I found y'all,
y'all was junior crackheads,

01:16:01.975 --> 01:16:03.851
and now y'all supermodels.

01:16:04.519 --> 01:16:06.729
I taught you so much.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.481
Yes, you did.

01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:22.996
We did it.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:25.497
What'd we do?

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:28.625
- We made $5,200!
- We're not gonna die?

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:29.960
- We're not gonna die!
- We're not gonna die!

01:16:29.961 --> 01:16:32.296
Wait. Wait, what?

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:34.172
- Hey, Bethany, girl.
- Tell you about it later.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:35.590
Wait, was that on the table?

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.384
Now, if we make
the rest of this money,

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.636
then we're gonna get the rent,
and we ain't got to be homeless.

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:41.680
Girl, I might even get my car
out the impound.

01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:44.474
Wait, can we circle back
to the dying thing?

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:46.728
Is that...

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:52.441
Shit. What time is it?

01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:54.318
It's 9:52.

01:16:54.319 --> 01:16:55.652
Everybody want to be punctual

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:57.237
when it's time to
get into some bullshit.

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:58.822
Okay, look,
we just give him the money,

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.115
and then we'll be safe.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.950
"Safe"? Th-There it is again.

01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:06.121
Oh, no. Not today.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.331
Oh, shit.

01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:08.498
Lolo has entered the building,

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:09.791
so I'mma gonna
get up out of here.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:12.586
You can stay if you want to,
but I'm out this motherfucker.

01:17:12.587 --> 01:17:14.171
Enjoy the chili.

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.180
I don't know about this.
Yeah. I'm out.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.182
-  Let's keep the money.
- What?

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:26.266
Let's keep the money.

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:27.351
What do you mean
"let's keep the money"?

01:17:27.352 --> 01:17:28.435
The motherfucker is right there.

01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:29.561
I know he's right there,
but just stall him.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:31.980
Girl, stall him for what?
We have the money.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.231
And we went through hell
to get it.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:34.816
And we'll die
if we don't give it up.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:36.068
You know what I'm saying.

01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:37.611
Didn't you just say
you was tired?

01:17:37.612 --> 01:17:38.862
Bro, if we give that money
to Lolo,

01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:40.280
we'll be right back
in the same place.

01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:41.490
And the next month after that

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:42.949
and the next month after that
and the month after that.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.243
Of course, I'm tired, girl.
I'm exhausted.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:47.204
I want to break the cycle,
but that's just not us.

01:17:47.205 --> 01:17:49.956
Okay? Sometimes people go
paycheck to paycheck.

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.291
Just like you said.

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:52.667
Trust me.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.087
So, what you gonna do?

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.132
Oh.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.926
I think I'm piecing it together.

01:18:00.927 --> 01:18:02.969
You know, Bethany,
maybe you should go, uh,

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.805
check out the refreshment table
or something like that.

01:18:04.806 --> 01:18:06.014
Okay, well, I have pepper spray.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:07.266
Trust me.

01:18:09.477 --> 01:18:10.478
Thank you.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.521
Please just go home.

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:13.605
Okay.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:16.401
What the fuck
is this gentrification shit?

01:18:17.777 --> 01:18:18.778
What's up, Dreux?

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:23.908
Um, grand rising, King.
Um, welcome to my humble abode.

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.703
The fuck is my chips?

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:32.165
Uh, well, technically,
it's not 10:00 yet,

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:34.293
so we got about
five more minutes.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:36.462
I'm here.

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.423
So where the fuck is my bread?

01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:41.466
If you and your goons could
just chill for a little bit,

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:43.552
I promise you my homegirl
is on her way back

01:18:43.553 --> 01:18:45.220
from the ATM
to get you your money.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:54.355
Look, bitch,
I'm trying to be polite.

01:18:57.150 --> 01:18:58.692
But you fucking
with my gangster.

01:18:58.693 --> 01:19:00.152
Well, wait a minute.

01:19:00.153 --> 01:19:02.028
Now, damn, what you gonna do?

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:04.573
Shoot me
in front of these people?

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:06.533
Shit. You is.

01:19:06.534 --> 01:19:07.618
Fuck.

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:11.413
What people?

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:13.999
King Lolo, just don't do
nothing crazy, okay?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.500
We have the money.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.711
Just-Just, you know,
think about the children.

01:19:17.712 --> 01:19:20.130
I don't give a fuck
about the goddamn children.

01:19:20.131 --> 01:19:22.717
What? Not even infants?

01:19:26.888 --> 01:19:29.222
You looking me
in my motherfucking eyes?

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:30.724
No, I'm not.

01:19:30.725 --> 01:19:31.975
Yo, Lolo!

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:34.644
Uh, Dreux, this is
a distraction. Run, bitch!

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:37.981
- Run!
-Bitch!

01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:40.609
Get 'em, motherfuckers!

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.861
Get low!

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:44.864
Go, go, go, go.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:52.914
Yeah!

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:55.123
I love this shit.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:58.794
Quick. Under here.

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:02.965
Get that ass.

01:20:04.634 --> 01:20:06.844
Hey, where they go?

01:20:09.222 --> 01:20:10.765
Where the fuck they at?

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:13.976
Look around!

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.397
I think I can hear
their little heart beating.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:29.783
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:20:29.784 --> 01:20:30.867
Nah!

01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:31.952
<i>Lionel Longfellow,</i>

01:20:31.953 --> 01:20:33.286
<i>we've been looking for you.</i>

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:35.288
No,
I ain't going back, bitch!

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:36.998
Fuck you!

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:42.837
- The hell was that?
- Girl, let's go.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.514
Come on.

01:20:53.558 --> 01:20:55.184
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:58.228
Fuck. Come on, come on, come on.

01:20:58.229 --> 01:21:00.939
I'm so glad
they didn't change the locks.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.024
Okay.

01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:06.444
Girl, I ain't never seen
the cops pull up that fast.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.530
You called them?

01:21:07.655 --> 01:21:09.406
Them ain't the cops.

01:21:09.407 --> 01:21:10.950
Shit.

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:13.994
- What's all this?
- What the fuck, Keshawn?

01:21:13.995 --> 01:21:15.162
I just wanted to say that,

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:18.206
Alyssa, you're the only one
that ever really believed in me.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:19.791
And, listen, I-I see that now.

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:22.795
And, look, I... I know
how much I fucked up and...

01:21:24.714 --> 01:21:26.257
I want-- I want
to make it up to you.

01:21:26.966 --> 01:21:28.383
By burning all my good candles?

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:30.427
You just summoned, like,
30 demons.

01:21:30.428 --> 01:21:32.387
Please get your lying ass out of
my house before I call Berniece.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:34.639
No, no, no, please.
Berniece is, um...

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.016
I'm scared.

01:21:36.017 --> 01:21:38.310
She's strong-willed, and, uh,

01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:41.980
she makes me do things
that I don't want to do.

01:21:41.981 --> 01:21:43.982
I'm not-- I'm not giving up
on us right now.

01:21:43.983 --> 01:21:46.318
<i>♪ The way you walk
The way you talk ♪</i>

01:21:46.319 --> 01:21:47.485
Please, I need you
to get the hell on.

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:49.864
<i>♪ And, baby, it's you ♪</i>

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:58.538
You fucking bitches
called them folks on me.

01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:00.749
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That wasn't us. That wasn't us.

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:03.543
I'm King fucking Lolo!

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:04.711
Hey, hey, hey, listen.
Hey, hey, listen.

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:06.087
I don't even live here.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.631
- This place...
- Really?

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:08.757
I'm just saying, this is your...

01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:10.008
- Motherfuck--
-Shut the fuck up!

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:11.760
You motherfuckers think
this shit is sweet?

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:13.261
- No.
- I'mma show you what happen

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:15.389
with people that fuck with me.

01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:21.519
Ooh, shit.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.023
Shit.

01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:27.734
The motherfucking...

01:22:27.735 --> 01:22:29.152
- Universe!
- Universe!

01:22:29.153 --> 01:22:31.946
I thought he was gonna eat us.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.782
Oh!

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:34.950
Uh-uh.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.787
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:22:38.788 --> 01:22:39.829
Keshawn!

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:40.914
Come on, come on,
help me, help me!

01:22:40.915 --> 01:22:42.708
-I didn't even do any--
- Fuck.

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:46.170
Uh... No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:49.339
-Keshawn!
- My T-shirts!

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.299
Keshawn, stop!
How you always make shit worse?

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.467
- How am I making it worse?
-Get back!

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.052
I'm putting it out!
What are you talking about?

01:22:54.053 --> 01:22:55.930
You're fucking wafting it.

01:22:58.265 --> 01:23:00.642
Come on, y'all.
We got to go. We got to go.

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:02.936
- Come on! Come on!
- Wait. W-W-W-Wait.

01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:05.313
- Bring King Lolo.
- What?

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:07.148
Girl, that motherfucker
tried to kill us.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:08.942
I don't want that fucking karma.
I don't want that.

01:23:08.943 --> 01:23:10.026
I don't care about karma.

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:11.194
I really hate her,
but she got a point.

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:12.862
- Nah, I'm not going.
- Fuck him! Guys, he doesn't...

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:14.406
Hey, come on.

01:23:14.407 --> 01:23:16.908
Oh, my God.

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:19.119
Oh, my gosh.
Help me pull him more.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.203
I'm pulling.

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:23.873
Someone call 911.
Someone call 911.

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:25.625
Help! Help!

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:27.711
Fuck! Fucking bars.

01:23:27.712 --> 01:23:29.255
Damn.
Help!

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:31.840
I don't want to die in here.

01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:34.301
Somebody go block
the bottom of the door.

01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:37.470
You block it! Fuck!

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:38.556
Okay.

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:40.598
- There's no oxygen.
- Look.

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:44.269
Before we die, I just want to
say I'm fucking sorry.

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:45.354
For everything.

01:23:46.564 --> 01:23:48.606
Girl, I know I got
some blame to take, too.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:49.899
It was crazy.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.069
I meant a lot
of what I said, but...

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:53.696
I'm sorry.

01:23:54.739 --> 01:23:56.197
'Cause I really do love you.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.450
I love you, too.

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:07.209
- Get... Keshawn.
- Get off me.

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:22.932
- Thank God.
-Thank God.

01:24:22.933 --> 01:24:25.144
-You okay?
-  Thank you.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.395
It's all right.
I got you.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.691
-Hold on tight.
- Thank you so much.

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:32.902
You gonna be all right.

01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:37.322
Alyssa, Alyssa,
listen, listen, listen, listen.

01:24:37.323 --> 01:24:42.286
Baby, come on,
I-I don't want this t-to end.

01:24:43.454 --> 01:24:44.704
There you go.

01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:46.664
Come on,
I think I...

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:47.874
I might love you.

01:24:47.875 --> 01:24:49.084
Please stop.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:51.086
You don't love me,

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:52.796
you don't like me,

01:24:52.797 --> 01:24:54.673
and you damn sure
don't respect me.

01:24:57.176 --> 01:24:58.177
I deserve better.

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:02.931
Out through
your mouth.

01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:05.266
Nice slow breaths.

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.686
All right?

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.026
Maniac?

01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:17.780
Hey, Dreux.

01:25:18.489 --> 01:25:19.490
There you go.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.033
I got you.

01:25:21.492 --> 01:25:23.868
It's crazy because
I almost bought this property.

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:24.953
You know, real estate shit,

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:26.204
but it's a fire hazard,
as you can see.

01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:27.330
- Yeah.
- So, yeah,

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:28.498
there was pretty much
fire everywhere.

01:25:28.499 --> 01:25:29.999
So, you know,
I had a platonic friend...

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.125
- Oh, my God.
- ...and her friend in there,

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.210
and I just had to throw myself

01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:33.336
in front of the fire
to save their lives.

01:25:33.337 --> 01:25:34.420
You know, hero shit.

01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:35.588
I heard you got
an air conditioner, no?

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:37.465
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- I'm King goddamn Lolo!

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:39.050
Okay. Yeah,
I heard it's cool, but...

01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:41.469
- Kathy, what are you doing here?
- I wanted to thank you.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.679
Mr. Longfellow's been on

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.013
our list of
most delinquent for years.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:45.223
Get your hands
off my shit!

01:25:45.224 --> 01:25:46.516
- Y'all tracked down King Lolo.
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:46.517 --> 01:25:49.227
- Y'all gonna remember Lolo.
- Watch your head.

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:52.814
- How you even know he was here?
- Miss Brown, she tipped us off.

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:53.898
What?

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.609
Girl, I told you
I figured it out.

01:25:56.277 --> 01:25:57.278
The photos.

01:25:58.195 --> 01:25:59.405
At the Payday.

01:25:59.989 --> 01:26:01.949
That sound like ho-ing to you?

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:04.367
<i>It didn't mean anything
at the time,</i>

01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:06.203
<i>but when I saw him
at the party...</i>

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:09.956
...I remembered.

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:12.625
You made a plan.

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:14.294
You made a plan!

01:26:14.295 --> 01:26:16.004
I can't let the universe
figure out everything.

01:26:16.005 --> 01:26:18.840
- We'll wire you your reward.
- Wait, wait. Reward?

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:21.259
Oh! Girl, how much is it?

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.177
$30. Whoo, whoo!

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.929
- I'm tired of you.
- You don't want it?

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:26.681
- We'll take it, but...
- Okay.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.474
- Get your ass...
- Congratulations.

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:29.601
On my fucking nerves.

01:26:29.602 --> 01:26:30.810
She always thinks
she's important.

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.395
It's the air
that she got with it.

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:33.814
- You know what I mean?
- It's them slacks.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.066
- Hey, Maniac.
- Y'all good?

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:38.152
Hmm.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:41.155
Um...

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:43.489
Is that a pigeon? Let me just...

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.159
Uh, girl...

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.328
So, when were you gonna tell me
you're a firefighter?

01:26:48.329 --> 01:26:50.496
That's what I was trying
to tell you before.

01:26:50.497 --> 01:26:52.582
Yes, I went to juvie,

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:53.917
but then they transferred me

01:26:53.918 --> 01:26:55.293
- to the fire academy.
- Hmm.

01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:57.295
Yeah, I've been fighting fires
ever since.

01:26:57.296 --> 01:26:58.755
This whole time,
I thought you was a killer.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:01.925
That's really fucked up, honestly.

01:27:01.926 --> 01:27:04.260
A nigga was really just
stealing shit from Fox Hills.

01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:05.595
- Wow. I'm sorry.
- Nah, it's cool.

01:27:05.596 --> 01:27:07.180
I'll forgive you.

01:27:07.181 --> 01:27:09.642
If you could forgive me
for not coming to your party.

01:27:10.476 --> 01:27:11.684
Look like you had
that shit turnt, though.

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:13.686
It was.

01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:14.772
And deal.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.149
You know,
this shit really ain't fair.

01:27:18.359 --> 01:27:19.984
I just dragged you
out a burning building,

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:21.152
and you still look fine as hell.

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:22.947
Boy, stop!

01:27:23.489 --> 01:27:25.741
Nah, but for real,
I'm sorry about your place.

01:27:26.325 --> 01:27:27.617
I mean, it really shouldn't
have gone up so fast.

01:27:27.618 --> 01:27:29.160
Nah, Uche's definitely

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:31.454
gonna be facing all the fire
safety negligence charges

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:32.538
when I get my hands on him.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:36.125
Well, that's some solace
because I am homeless.

01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:38.544
Yeah, you might be.
But don't worry.

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.546
You're gonna have a real good
insurance claim.

01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:41.631
I got you.

01:27:41.632 --> 01:27:43.425
- Thanks.
-Hey, hey.

01:27:44.093 --> 01:27:45.468
My building, oh!

01:27:45.469 --> 01:27:47.053
- What is happening here now?
-Ooh.

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:48.638
- Uche, you in trouble now.
-No. Why?

01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:49.973
I should probably go talk
with him.

01:27:49.974 --> 01:27:51.057
Fuck you, Uche.

01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:53.643
But is you gonna call me,
or is you still scared?

01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:56.855
I'mma call you.

01:27:58.983 --> 01:28:00.234
All right, bet.

01:28:02.653 --> 01:28:04.404
"Is you too scared?"

01:28:04.405 --> 01:28:06.155
Yes,
but I'm still going to call.

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:08.282
- What was that?
- Girl, I don't know!

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:12.454
Hey, are y'all okay, baby?
Do you need anything?

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.331
You know, people love
to act the fool on the first.

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:17.166
Really, are you okay?

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.002
'Cause, look, you could stay
with me as long as you need.

01:28:19.003 --> 01:28:20.294
Now, it's only a one-bedroom,

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:21.754
and you can't bring
all that shit up in here.

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:22.839
But we'll figure it out.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.257
- Yes, Mama Ruth!
-I love you!

01:28:24.258 --> 01:28:26.009
I love you so much.

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.177
I love y'all, too.

01:28:28.595 --> 01:28:30.054
- Still got them Hot Cheetos?
- Oh.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:32.265
- Girl, please.
- You know you want to taste it.

01:28:32.266 --> 01:28:34.851
Two Hot Cheeto
martinis coming up.

01:28:34.852 --> 01:28:37.186
You ain't gonna
let this shit go.

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:40.356
But, you know, what you did
let go was Keshawn's lame ass.

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:42.316
Oh, God, I kicked his ass
all the way to the curb.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.277
But make sure you make
one of these for Mama Ruth,

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:45.361
'cause she has no idea

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:46.863
how you about to eat her
out of a house and home.

01:28:46.864 --> 01:28:49.574
You already know
she about to put us to work.

01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:51.617
I got to come up with a plan.

01:28:51.618 --> 01:28:53.036
What you mean
"plan," girl?

01:28:53.037 --> 01:28:55.455
It's already in motion.
I mean, look around.

01:28:55.456 --> 01:28:57.750
This was a huge success.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.462
I mean, I did meet
this one guy at the party.

01:29:02.296 --> 01:29:03.714
He has his own gallery.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:07.800
And he asked me if I would
be down to do a pop-up series.

01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:09.844
Girl, that's huge.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.471
Congratulations!

01:29:11.472 --> 01:29:13.348
Mmm, I didn't say yes.

01:29:14.058 --> 01:29:16.100
Yeah, I told him
I needed to consult

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:18.436
- with my business partner.
- Uh...

01:29:18.437 --> 01:29:21.314
- If you'll still have me.
- Hell, yeah.

01:29:21.315 --> 01:29:24.067
Girl, we locked in.
It's me and you.

01:29:24.068 --> 01:29:25.485
Till death do us part.

01:29:25.486 --> 01:29:27.613
You want
to marry me so bad.

01:29:28.322 --> 01:29:29.530
I just love a ceremony.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.116
Mmm.

01:29:32.326 --> 01:29:33.743
Girl.

01:29:33.744 --> 01:29:35.828
It's ghetto, but it's got
a runway quality about it.

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:37.997
It's refreshing. It's spicy.
It's drunk.

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:39.083
Mm-hmm. It's explosive.

01:29:44.505 --> 01:29:46.715
Uche really gonna have to fix
our apartment now.

01:29:47.925 --> 01:29:50.051
We need marble
countertops, a Jacuzzi tub...

01:29:50.052 --> 01:29:51.135
Yup, yup.

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:52.678
Separate area
for an art studio.

01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:53.846
Crown molding, too!

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:56.140
We gonna be
living in luxury.

01:30:02.022 --> 01:30:03.607
I hate feeling
like I'm intruding.

01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:19.039
{\an8}I should've went to law school.

01:30:26.797 --> 01:30:28.423
You see this, Lord?

01:30:28.549 --> 01:30:30.925
This is what I get for trying
to save your people.

01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:33.553
They wouldn't even do this
in a white neighborhood.

01:30:33.554 --> 01:30:36.973
I'm out here all alone
with no sword or nothing.

01:30:36.974 --> 01:30:39.308
Trying to protect the innocent.

01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:41.520
Do they care? They don't care.

01:30:46.567 --> 01:30:48.485
- Bye, Miss Dorothy. See you.
-Bye, baby.

01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:52.990
Yo.

01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:00.663
Could have this
whole block lit up.

01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:01.748
Okay.

01:31:06.837 --> 01:31:08.172
Till death do us part.

01:32:38.387 --> 01:32:39.971
<i>Oh, he strikes again!</i>
