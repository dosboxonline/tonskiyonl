00:51.176 --> 00:54.928
-l never heard of him.
-Who?

00:55.096 --> 00:56.472
The man you recommended.

00:56.639 --> 00:59.099
The guitar fighter?

00:59.267 --> 01:04.229
Wiped out a couple towns
single-handedly. A real nut. Yeah.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.983
You heard of him. You just didn't know
it was him they were talking about.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.277
You should meet him.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.988
Me. Me. That's me.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.162
As long as l'm not the guy
that has to make the introduction.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.998
Were you in Mexico during
the Barillo cartel massacre?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.084
No.

01:25.251 --> 01:29.588
That's when I first heard about him.
He was a legend.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.883
They used to say he was the biggest
Mexican they'd ever seen.

01:33.051 --> 01:37.846
That was total bullshit.
He was 5'9", 5'10", tops.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.724
That's no record,
but bigger than most of us.

01:40.892 --> 01:45.187
But Marquez, that's a different story.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.231
Marquez.

01:47.398 --> 01:51.276
Marquez. General Marquez.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.656
Powerful, dangerous.

01:55.824 --> 01:59.910
Marquez, he really had it in
for this Mariachi, see.

02:09.586 --> 02:13.298
They called him "Mariachi"
because he used to carry this guitar.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.884
A guitar?

02:16.052 --> 02:18.929
Believe me, he really knew
how to play it too.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.916
Look, this story is well-traveled.

02:48.084 --> 02:51.086
It might have picked up some
embellishments along the way.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.173
Just read between the lines.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.377
Now, he may not have been
the biggest Mexican ever...

03:32.545 --> 03:35.422
-All right.
-...but she was as deadly...

03:35.590 --> 03:36.924
...as she was beautiful.

03:37.091 --> 03:41.762
-There's a girl?
-Oh, yeah. There's a girl.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.390
When he'd run out of ammo,
she'd take over.

03:47.143 --> 03:51.146
The most drop-dead gorgeous
woman you'll ever see.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.527
That's where all the trouble began.
She was with Marquez.

04:38.695 --> 04:43.532
And when Marquez saw that she was
with the Mariachi, well, he went crazy.

04:43.700 --> 04:48.453
He hunted him down and fought
Mariachi to the death. And then she...

04:50.498 --> 04:53.375
...put a bullet in his heart.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.591
Only he didn't die.

05:03.261 --> 05:06.555
-l don't know what happened after that.
-Would you like some?

05:06.723 --> 05:10.726
No. Maybe Marquez caught up
with them, or the cartels.

05:10.893 --> 05:14.896
But like l said, the man
is a myth, a legend.

05:15.064 --> 05:18.775
And if he's still living,
he's the one you want.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.819
Well...

05:23.072 --> 05:24.614
...that is truly unbelievable.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.909
Well, l'm not big on telling stories.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.537
Where's the money?
That's the reason I'm here.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.707
I couldn't find a briefcase
small enough...

05:33.875 --> 05:37.127
...for $1 0,000 in cash.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.634
It'll do.

05:44.802 --> 05:49.097
Just for my own edification,
I offered you 50.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.309
-Why'd you say no?
-l'm not a greedy man.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.770
Not looking to get rich quick.

05:54.937 --> 06:00.067
Besides, 50,000 is a lot for what
you wanted me to find out, you know.

06:00.234 --> 06:04.279
You may as just as well put a bullet
in my head as cough it up, right?

06:05.615 --> 06:07.366
But 1 0?

06:07.533 --> 06:10.202
Ten thousand is civilized.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.788
Ten is something
we both can live with.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.044
Ten might still be too much.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.964
You'd kill me over $1 0,000?

06:23.633 --> 06:29.888
You wouldn't dare.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.850
Yes, l would.

07:51.596 --> 07:55.599
Would you do me the honor?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.645
You need to learn to play.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.481
That's why you're here.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.642
I hear this is a town of Gunmen.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.645
We only make guitars here.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.901
Mariachi.

10:53.694 --> 10:54.819
Which one?

11:02.828 --> 11:05.288
I don't know who you mean.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.729
I'm honored to be in your presence.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.357
But there's someone else who
wants to meet you.

12:20.781 --> 12:24.159
Keep it. He made that for you.

12:49.059 --> 12:52.896
You know, if l was you, son,
I'd turn around and go back right now.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.190
Go back to where l came from...

12:55.357 --> 12:59.652
...instead of selling my mind
and my soul to these cocksuckers.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.697
You speak English?

13:03.157 --> 13:05.366
I didn't think so.

13:07.203 --> 13:11.164
Attempts have been made on me
and my family by the cartels.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.877
The same cartels that are
threatening our freedom...

13:18.380 --> 13:21.716
freedom which we must
defend to the death.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.066
I present to you Senor Blascoe.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.757
Please sit.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.596
We hear you want to work for us.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.773
I too am ready to start a new life.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.447
This is your lucky day.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.041
Did you order my pibil?

14:39.295 --> 14:42.255
-Does it have a name?
-They call him "El."

14:42.715 --> 14:44.632
As in "The."

14:44.800 --> 14:47.844
I know what it means. Thank you.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.722
Alert the Barillo cartel...

14:50.890 --> 14:55.059
...that El has come out of hiding.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.104
-l don't think we should--
-Are you a Mexican...

14:58.272 --> 15:00.773
...or a Mexi-can't?

15:03.152 --> 15:05.278
I'm a Mexican.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.196
Good.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.325
Then do as l say.

15:18.125 --> 15:22.462
-Nice tune.
-Something my brother taught me.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.214
I killed him.

15:25.382 --> 15:29.344
Yes, l was privy to that
information already. How charming.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.805
You know, El,
if l may call you that...

15:32.973 --> 15:37.769
...l've been doing a little snooping
around, and it seems that the cartels...

15:37.937 --> 15:40.021
...have quite a price on your head.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.440
I wouldn't want to be you.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.527
Tell me, is there anyone
who doesn't want you dead?

15:48.697 --> 15:50.698
You tell me.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.201
I need you to kill a man.

15:54.453 --> 15:59.290
El, you really must try this
because it's puerco pibil.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.336
It's a slow-roasted pork, nothing fancy.
It just happens to be my favorite...

16:03.504 --> 16:08.925
...and l order it with a tequila and lime
in every dive I go to in this country.

16:09.093 --> 16:14.222
And honestly, that is the best
it's ever been anywhere.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.516
In fact, it's too good.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.894
It's so good that when l'm finished,
I'll pay my check...

16:20.062 --> 16:22.897
...walk straight into the kitchen
and shoot the cook.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.609
Because that's what l do.
I restore the balance to this country.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.237
And that is what l would like
from you right now.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.656
Help keep the balance
by pulling the trigger.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.701
-You want me to shoot the cook?
-No, I'll shoot the cook.

16:34.868 --> 16:38.162
My car's parked
out back anyway. You...

16:39.164 --> 16:41.165
...will kill Marquez.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.293
Do you remember General Marquez?

16:46.797 --> 16:48.715
He's being paid by Barillo...

16:48.882 --> 16:51.592
...to kill the President
in an attempted coup d'etat.

16:52.052 --> 16:55.596
-Attempted?
-Oh, no. The President will be killed...

16:55.764 --> 16:59.600
...because he's that piece of good pork
that needs to get balanced out.

16:59.768 --> 17:03.229
I say "attempted" because we don't
want Marquez taking power.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.566
I need you to put the hurting,
so to speak, on Marquez...

17:06.733 --> 17:09.902
...after he's killed
the President. Savvy?

17:10.069 --> 17:13.906
-So why me?
-You've got nothing to live for...

17:14.074 --> 17:16.409
...and, in a way, you're already dead.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.537
And Marquez is the man
who killed you.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.749
So why not return the favor?
Go to the church.

17:22.915 --> 17:26.044
Meet with an associate
of mine named Salome at 3:00.

17:26.545 --> 17:31.090
And l will contact you afterwards
if we have a deal.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.060
Was I right?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.354
I guess not.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.334
The last shipment of guns
that were seized at our border...

18:06.502 --> 18:08.669
...have not been
accounted for, Sanchez.

18:08.837 --> 18:13.508
You are now off that assignment.
Who wants to volunteer?

18:14.384 --> 18:17.845
Okay. You, Gomez, it's yours.

18:18.013 --> 18:21.265
With el Presidente's new campaign
against the Barillo cartel...

18:21.433 --> 18:24.685
...their activities are being
pushed into the forefront.

18:24.853 --> 18:29.565
Large payments, deliveries,
whispers of a political takeover.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.277
I need new point men,
strong and willing.

18:33.445 --> 18:38.574
This is a top priority of el Presidente.
Who wants this?

18:39.535 --> 18:41.702
Romero, it's yours.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.455
Pick your secondary person.
A third, if you have to.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.041
That's all. Dismissed.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.212
I should take his left nut.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.132
You're with us.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.721
People of Culiacan.

19:02.015 --> 19:05.935
I've come here to bring you a
message of peace.

19:06.186 --> 19:09.897
Peace that at this moment is being
threatened by a group of people

19:10.065 --> 19:12.066
that is threatening our nation.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.485
People like Armando Barillo.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.196
I invite you to gather our forces...

19:17.364 --> 19:20.074
...in order to prevent the
destruction of our unity

19:20.409 --> 19:22.952
...and our peace.

19:23.412 --> 19:29.083
EL Presidente, history teaches us
no matter how great your armies are...

19:29.251 --> 19:32.211
...you will always need
the favor of the inhabitants...

19:32.379 --> 19:35.298
...to take possession of a province.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.759
How can you compete with
a man like Barillo? He owns Culiacan.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.553
He doesn't own its people.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.264
Barillo purchased hundreds
of homes and ranches...

19:43.432 --> 19:45.558
...in the northern part of Culiacan.

19:45.726 --> 19:49.437
And then he has turned around
and given these homes to the people.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.649
-He's a folk hero to them.
-He's also a mass murderer...

19:53.817 --> 19:55.776
...and a drug kingpin.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.947
He's trying to make himself a martyr
by drawing the people to his side...

20:00.115 --> 20:02.283
...but the people can
see through that.

20:02.701 --> 20:06.954
Men like Barillo have stolen
this country's soul.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.458
But my people will stand up
for what is right.

20:11.126 --> 20:14.170
I'm afraid they're no longer
your people, sir.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.216
Then l will die fighting.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.801
Are you with me?

20:24.139 --> 20:25.806
To the death.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.967
What's wrong?

21:44.928 --> 21:46.345
Everything.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.689
This way!

21:56.857 --> 21:58.607
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

22:00.736 --> 22:03.779
Any suggestions, Miss "Let's
get a room on the fifth floor...

22:03.947 --> 22:06.032
...so we can see
the beautiful sunset"?

22:10.412 --> 22:12.246
Jump.

22:19.087 --> 22:20.421
Swing, swing, swing.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.633
-Hang on!
-What do you mean, hold on?

22:31.058 --> 22:32.475
Let go now!

23:12.182 --> 23:13.307
Give me that!

23:13.809 --> 23:16.852
Stop the bus.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.961
A vow must be broken.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.547
Forgive me...

24:26.715 --> 24:28.924
for what I am about to become.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.806
-When was your last confession?
-An hour ago.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.726
-And the name of your priest?
-Sands.

24:38.894 --> 24:43.564
Okay. You are expected to carry out
your assignment to the letter--

24:43.732 --> 24:45.524
-Yeah, I know.
-Failure to appear...

24:45.734 --> 24:47.860
...in locations at assigned times...

24:48.028 --> 24:52.448
...results in forfeit of protection,
protection you will definitely need.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.366
-Yeah.
-You'll be paid.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.745
Coup d'etats, like elections,
don't come cheap.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.248
So there's plenty of dough
floating around.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.543
There's more.
You will be a free man...

25:04.711 --> 25:08.631
...from Marquez, the cartels,
and even from the President...

25:08.798 --> 25:11.800
...who isn't your biggest fan,
let's face it.

25:11.968 --> 25:15.471
-When do l begin?
-Give me a moment.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.513
It's a church, hombre.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.219
I'm sorry.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.800
Are you still standing?

27:59.052 --> 28:00.803
Still.

28:00.970 --> 28:05.182
Good. Well, the Barillo cartel
aren't the nicest of guys, are they?

28:05.767 --> 28:08.602
However, you've passed the test.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.688
You're gonna do just fine.

28:10.855 --> 28:15.234
Assemble your team, and l will
call you with further instructions.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.986
Over and out.

28:20.949 --> 28:26.453
I'm just walking my beat, friend.
Mexico's my beat, I'm walking it.

28:26.621 --> 28:30.541
I throw shapes, and they catch them.
I set them up and watch them fall.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.837
Have him meet me
at the bullfight at 5 p.m. What?

28:35.004 --> 28:37.673
Why would l want that?
Why would l want bubble gum?

28:42.637 --> 28:44.388
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:44.556 --> 28:49.977
Okay, this should hold the both
of us over for quite a long time.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.856
So l don't ever
want to see you again.

28:54.023 --> 28:55.983
Fuck off.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.581
-Hi.
-Hello.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.834
The CIA sharing a meal with the FBI.

29:14.002 --> 29:18.255
Now, if that isn't interagency
cooperation, l just don't know what is.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.008
-l'm retired FBI.
-A real agent never retires.

29:21.176 --> 29:23.677
He just takes it a little easier.

29:24.095 --> 29:29.349
-Why are we talking?
-You tracked down Armando Barillo...

29:29.517 --> 29:32.853
...for two years when he was running
operations out of San Antonio.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.564
Spinning wheels.
It never led to an arrest.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.901
Well, he--

29:39.068 --> 29:43.739
He is, in fact,
sitting directly behind you.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.240
I know.

29:45.408 --> 29:48.452
He settled back in.
He's been living here for six years.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.454
Can't be touched.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.957
Did you know that most agents
never even see a top-1 0 criminal...

29:54.125 --> 29:58.045
...for their entire careers?
You brought down two, didn't you?

29:58.213 --> 30:02.090
And now your third
is sitting in very close proximity.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.927
Now, retired or not...

30:05.094 --> 30:09.723
...that has really got to tug
on the old short and curlies.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.142
I'm a civilian now.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.729
Didn't he kill that agent friend
of yours? What was his name...

30:15.897 --> 30:18.023
...Archuleta?

30:20.777 --> 30:22.110
Yes.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.656
Barillo is a Mexican citizen.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.826
He cannot be extradited for crimes
committed in the U.S.

30:28.993 --> 30:32.371
Do you happen to know of a
Dr. Guevera? Worked for the cartel.

30:32.539 --> 30:38.293
This doctor pumped your friend
Archuleta full of drugs, day after day...

30:38.461 --> 30:43.048
...so that they could torture him
for two weeks before he died.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.967
You must have known that.

30:47.595 --> 30:51.932
Dr. Guevera himself
having dinner with your prey.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.643
I wonder what it is they're up to now.

30:55.436 --> 30:59.606
Two weeks of torture, Jorge.
Think about that.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.608
For your dead friend...

31:01.901 --> 31:04.528
...for the job you didn't finish
in San Antonio.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.365
Now, are you really going to let it
slip away again?

31:13.955 --> 31:18.000
I'd like you to have a bite
of my pork because it's...

31:18.459 --> 31:20.460
...the world.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.689
(Announcer)
It's Mariachi Happy Hour!

32:22.857 --> 32:24.399
Get your Mariachi song for 5 pesos.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.401
A Mariachi kiss for 20 pesos.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.112
And a Mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos!

32:33.409 --> 32:35.202
Where the hell have you been?

32:35.828 --> 32:37.037
Far away.

32:38.039 --> 32:38.914
Still fucking around?

32:40.583 --> 32:42.751
Let me get Fideo.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.380
I'm here for my guitar.

32:54.889 --> 32:57.015
It's his last night.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.018
They're firing him.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.604
Hey...

33:02.981 --> 33:05.607
...Fideo, it's me.

33:06.818 --> 33:10.237
-Still drinking.
-Like a fish.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.365
I guess we haven't changed
so much.

33:17.912 --> 33:20.747
I didn't think you'd ever
come back for this thing.

33:20.915 --> 33:23.375
Neither did l.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.752
Are we on?

33:26.087 --> 33:28.755
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.

33:31.092 --> 33:37.014
Bring him sober.
We're gonna need him, so...

33:37.181 --> 33:38.432
...coffee.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.600
Lots of coffee.

33:41.269 --> 33:45.939
Sometimes a revolution is exactly
what's needed to clean up the system.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.274
One...

33:47.692 --> 33:51.945
...giant enema, which just so happens
to be my area of expertise.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.075
Bullfights. Bull hockey.
Do you like this?

33:57.618 --> 34:01.621
The bull is stabbed,
prodded, beaten.

34:01.789 --> 34:07.335
The bull is wounded.
The bull is tired before the matador...

34:07.503 --> 34:11.630
...ever steps into the ring.
Now, is that victory?

34:11.882 --> 34:13.800
Of course it is.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.719
Wanna know
the secret to winning?

34:15.887 --> 34:17.929
Creative sportsmanship.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.848
In other words...

34:26.272 --> 34:28.815
...one has to rig the game.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.610
Go collect.

34:44.123 --> 34:47.583
EL Presidente is giving a speech
on the Day of the Dead...

34:47.752 --> 34:49.293
...in the town of Culiacan.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.920
He's going to be isolated...

34:51.089 --> 34:54.800
...in the main edificio
in the center of the plaza.

34:55.051 --> 34:58.053
Very easy access to him if...

34:58.221 --> 34:59.596
...somebody can get you in.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.766
Right.
You're the man who can do that.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.852
I am not the prince.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.688
I am the man behind the prince.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.608
-l see.
-He's not the first prince l've served...

35:11.776 --> 35:14.361
...nor the first one that l've betrayed.

35:14.779 --> 35:18.532
-You're a good rat. l like you.
-l try.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.202
The rest upon completion.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.664
-Mucho gusto.
-Right. Right.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.798
Every goddamn time.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.535
What do you want in life?

37:24.784 --> 37:26.493
Belini...

37:26.661 --> 37:30.372
...how long have you and l
done business together?

37:30.539 --> 37:32.457
A long time.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.542
And in a way...

37:34.710 --> 37:39.297
...l kind of, almost, could have the
tiniest smidgen of respect for you.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.174
Almost.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.510
But you need to stop farting around.

37:43.678 --> 37:47.222
Now, do you have the information
that I need on Barillo or do you not?

37:47.390 --> 37:49.641
I have what you need.

37:49.809 --> 37:53.770
I'm just enjoying this
temporary position of power.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.563
That make you nervous?

37:55.731 --> 37:59.192
You know that withholding vital
information from a federal officer...

37:59.360 --> 38:00.944
...is a serious offense.

38:01.153 --> 38:05.031
Especially when that officer has paid
handsomely for it...

38:05.199 --> 38:08.827
...and wouldn't think twice about
ripping that patch off your eyehole...

38:08.995 --> 38:11.371
...and skull-fucking you to death.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.209
No.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.213
I'm fine. Go away.

38:23.050 --> 38:26.052
I am fine. Go away.
You're off the hook.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.846
Leave me alone.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.141
That spill just cost you your life.

38:51.370 --> 38:52.704
A little help.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.431
Okay.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.350
I know it's on you somewhere.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.101
Somewhere.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.566
All right.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.818
Time to get messy.

39:41.045 --> 39:44.798
Well, l suppose l should thank you
for not sticking it up your ass.

39:48.594 --> 39:50.220
However.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.523
You're about a quart low.

40:18.999 --> 40:20.750
You're gonna pay for that, cop.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.962
-Why doesn't my key work anymore?
-lt's too small.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.343
-Stand back.
-l just-- I brought you a gift.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.803
I'm still mad at you.

40:31.971 --> 40:35.223
And trust me,
it wasn't easy to get. So....

40:36.684 --> 40:38.393
Come closer and l'll thank you.

40:41.355 --> 40:44.858
-Are you trying to give me a boner?
-Closer, l said.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.068
How about that little tip-off?

40:47.236 --> 40:51.614
Guarantees you a big arrest
and an accommodation.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.741
Even from your twisted little agency.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.910
I'm impressed.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.163
-But then what?
-Want to hear my plan?

40:58.330 --> 41:00.999
Either that or I start target practice.

41:01.167 --> 41:07.422
Okay. The new President is on a
quest to clear out the Barillo cartel.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.717
And Barillo has set up
a counterattack...

41:10.885 --> 41:14.262
...by hiring a military general
named Marquez.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.056
He wants him
to throw a coup d'etat...

41:17.224 --> 41:20.393
...while the President's
visiting Culiacan.

41:20.561 --> 41:23.605
Now, I have a man inside
as insurance...

41:23.772 --> 41:26.232
...to make sure that Marquez
never takes power.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.027
The last piece of the puzzle...

41:30.654 --> 41:33.907
...is Barillo. Your tip-off assures...

41:34.408 --> 41:37.994
...that Barillo is out of the picture
while the battle ensues.

41:38.162 --> 41:42.457
ln the aftermath
of this very healthy revolution...

41:42.625 --> 41:47.754
...I will calmly waltz away with
the 20 million pesos...

41:47.922 --> 41:51.382
...that Barillo is prepared to pay
Marquez for the coup.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.093
-You want me to go with you?
-You detain Barillo...

41:54.261 --> 41:57.555
...with the information that you have,
then you join me...

41:57.723 --> 41:59.724
...and share the spoils.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.314
You meet me two nights from now...

42:06.482 --> 42:08.942
...at La Pileta, 1 0 p.m. sharp...

42:09.109 --> 42:12.320
...and bring only
what's important to you.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.741
Oh, yeah.

42:16.951 --> 42:20.537
It might get a wee bit dangerous
there, sugar-butt. So....

42:22.122 --> 42:24.165
-Can you dig it?
-l can dig it.

42:24.458 --> 42:26.626
I want my key back.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.972
Testing. One, two. Testing.

43:17.678 --> 43:18.970
Hello?

43:19.138 --> 43:20.972
Can you hear me now?

43:21.473 --> 43:24.142
Okay-- Fucking bells.

43:24.643 --> 43:26.603
Did you assemble your team?

43:26.770 --> 43:28.563
You know I did.

43:29.064 --> 43:33.026
-Why are you having me followed?
-Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a...

43:33.193 --> 43:35.320
...guarantee of compliance,
shall we?

43:35.487 --> 43:37.238
Because Cucuy also...

43:37.406 --> 43:40.325
-...provides protection.
-From what? Mosquitoes?

43:40.492 --> 43:43.411
Oh, gosh, l really wouldn't mess
with him if l were you...

43:43.579 --> 43:45.455
...because he's a bit of a live wire.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.708
And he's not the happiest
that you killed his man.

43:49.251 --> 43:52.128
Oh, yeah, by the by,
I have your next assignment.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.391
You the Mariachis?

44:19.698 --> 44:23.201
This is the back entrance.
Make a note of it.

44:37.758 --> 44:39.884
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

44:40.344 --> 44:41.386
Who are they?

44:41.595 --> 44:43.054
Musicians.

44:48.894 --> 44:51.354
Why so heavy?

44:52.981 --> 44:55.191
Built in amplifier.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.277
Play something.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.989
All right.

45:18.632 --> 45:20.216
Let's go.

45:22.970 --> 45:26.139
-l was afraid you couldn't play.
-Are you kidding?

46:14.855 --> 46:17.190
What we are looking for is support

46:17.399 --> 46:19.066
from the people of this state.

46:19.526 --> 46:21.861
A man can do a lot alone,

46:22.780 --> 46:26.365
but he can do better with his
people backing him.

46:27.451 --> 46:30.119
I wonder how much
we're getting paid for this shit.

46:31.079 --> 46:36.209
A man who wants nothing
is invincible, cabron.

46:46.512 --> 46:47.762
Hey.

46:47.930 --> 46:51.390
Are you gonna tell him
that this is his last meal?

46:57.231 --> 46:59.482
Is there a particular song you
would like to hear?

47:18.210 --> 47:22.088
We just played for el Presidente,
I can't buy half a tequila with this shit!

47:23.257 --> 47:24.799
It was meant as an honor.

47:25.092 --> 47:26.759
Fuck honor.

47:27.094 --> 47:30.221
-We need money.
-The score's tomorrow. Enough for all.

47:30.889 --> 47:32.723
Even for you, Lorenzo.

47:32.891 --> 47:36.435
Why are you suddenly interested
in the score? What's in it for you?

47:36.603 --> 47:38.437
Only revenge.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.732
Much delayed revenge.

47:47.364 --> 47:49.031
Go practice.

47:49.950 --> 47:51.450
Practice?

47:52.035 --> 47:55.204
Playing or shooting?

47:55.372 --> 47:56.956
What do you think?

47:57.624 --> 47:59.542
I don't think. l drink.

48:08.135 --> 48:10.303
-Yeah, hello.
-Been following Barillo...

48:10.470 --> 48:15.141
-...and the good Dr. Guevera.
-Oh, Agent Ramirez, no longer retired.

48:15.309 --> 48:19.145
-Good man. Welcome to the fold.
-l haven't seen illegal activities yet.

48:19.313 --> 48:22.523
Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled
for a medical procedure...

48:22.691 --> 48:24.025
...on November 2.

48:24.192 --> 48:26.235
The Day of the Dead.
That's tomorrow.

48:26.403 --> 48:29.989
Also identified a member of the group
as Billy Chambers.

48:30.157 --> 48:33.492
A fugitive. We've been wanting
to pick him up for some time now.

48:33.660 --> 48:36.621
Billy Chambers? Yeah. You sure?

48:36.788 --> 48:38.831
-Bet my badge on it.
-Well...

48:38.999 --> 48:41.792
...whatever they're up to,
I can guarantee you...

48:41.960 --> 48:44.003
...that it's going
to happen tomorrow.

48:44.171 --> 48:46.839
-So I suggest you--
-What's going down tomorrow?

48:47.007 --> 48:49.050
If you see an opening, take it.

48:49.217 --> 48:52.803
-What do you know?
-Not enough. Get inside.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.395
I've got nothing.

49:01.772 --> 49:04.440
I gotta get in. l got nothing.

49:05.275 --> 49:08.444
Try to make a move.
I don't have a move to make.

49:10.906 --> 49:13.074
What are you gonna do, stupid?

49:17.704 --> 49:19.997
Billy Chambers is on the move.

49:23.710 --> 49:25.711
Where are you going?

49:28.966 --> 49:31.050
You're buying a taco.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.135
This is too easy.

49:33.553 --> 49:35.471
Where are the other guys?

49:36.431 --> 49:38.349
This is a setup.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.935
It smells like a setup.

49:47.734 --> 49:49.568
I'm making my move.

50:25.939 --> 50:27.773
Billy Chambers.

50:30.068 --> 50:33.446
-Well, that depends who's asking.
-l thought that was you.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.574
-Here, let me pay for this.
-Oh, well, thanks.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.203
Oh, goddamn it.

50:41.371 --> 50:44.457
-ls that real?
-Yes, it is.

50:44.750 --> 50:47.626
Goddamn.
What took you boys so long?

50:49.379 --> 50:50.921
Whoa, hey, friend.

50:52.424 --> 50:54.008
You ain't gonna need that.

50:54.217 --> 50:57.803
Believe it or not, man,
I'm ready to go.

50:58.472 --> 51:00.639
Let's talk over there.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.518
After you.

51:09.399 --> 51:12.068
Man, l just wanna get out of here.

51:12.360 --> 51:15.154
I've been on the run, hiding out here
down in Mexico...

51:15.322 --> 51:19.492
...for the last eight goddamn years.

51:19.659 --> 51:24.121
And l've been working
for this here cartel for the last four.

51:24.539 --> 51:27.875
I ain't got shit. All I got
is what I'm wearing on my back.

51:28.043 --> 51:31.128
I can't go nowhere.
Sort of got me by the balls, you know?

51:31.797 --> 51:33.547
Jorge Ramirez.

51:33.715 --> 51:38.219
I'll take you in under the FBl's
supervision and protection...

51:38.386 --> 51:44.266
...until we can take you back, where
you will be prosecuted for your crimes.

51:44.434 --> 51:46.685
-ln the U.S.?
-ln the U.S.

51:48.355 --> 51:52.399
The things that l've had to do
for the goddamn cartel are...

51:52.567 --> 51:56.028
-...unspeakable.
-You don't know what Barillo's up to?

51:56.196 --> 51:58.239
I'm close to the man.

51:58.698 --> 52:00.908
I'm real close.

52:01.076 --> 52:03.828
But he don't let nobody in,
that cocksucker.

52:04.037 --> 52:06.163
Can you get him close to Barillo?

52:10.877 --> 52:12.294
Him?

52:13.130 --> 52:15.089
I need your help.

52:20.095 --> 52:21.846
Then you get me out of here.

52:22.305 --> 52:24.056
Then l'll get you out of here.

52:25.559 --> 52:27.434
Him too.

53:04.681 --> 53:07.349
There's cartel on every corner.

53:09.269 --> 53:12.271
Sands told me
you handle protection.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.773
I don't work for Sands anymore.

53:14.941 --> 53:18.068
And since l'm a Mexican,
I can do whatever l want.

53:19.571 --> 53:22.031
Then l guess
I don't work for Sands neither.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.742
-Goodbye.
-There's a price on your head.

53:25.035 --> 53:28.829
I'm going to collect. Why don't you
just tell Barillo everything you know.

53:28.997 --> 53:31.665
And then maybe
he'll just cut off your hands.

53:31.833 --> 53:33.125
And if l don't?

53:33.293 --> 53:35.961
You know that old man
I killed in your village?

53:36.129 --> 53:38.297
What if your whole village was next?

53:40.800 --> 53:42.635
Would you kill them?

53:42.802 --> 53:45.221
Me? They certainly would.

53:48.016 --> 53:50.267
Then l guess I have no choice...

53:51.311 --> 53:53.229
...but to kill you all.

54:05.033 --> 54:06.659
You...

54:07.077 --> 54:08.369
...are last.

56:17.415 --> 56:20.292
That should put him out
for a few days...

56:20.960 --> 56:23.295
...and give him some nasty dreams.

56:29.511 --> 56:31.845
You have to relax your fingers.

56:33.765 --> 56:36.809
Music is pure, from one's soul.

56:38.103 --> 56:44.316
If the soul is pure,
the music flows free.

56:52.450 --> 56:54.660
And if the soul isn't pure?

56:55.495 --> 56:57.496
Then you must practice
like a motherfucker.

56:58.665 --> 57:00.791
I present to you...

57:01.459 --> 57:03.502
...Senor Cucuy.

57:05.880 --> 57:09.216
Get this condescending ass
out of here.

57:10.552 --> 57:12.261
You want me to break his fingers?

57:12.429 --> 57:14.763
No. I want you to chop them off.

57:16.391 --> 57:19.810
-l was just making a joke.
-l wasn't.

57:28.027 --> 57:30.279
Sit, please.

57:32.449 --> 57:33.866
So...

57:34.033 --> 57:37.411
...you are the man who brought us...

57:37.579 --> 57:39.288
...the Mariachi.

57:39.956 --> 57:43.208
The man l work for, Mr. Sands...

57:43.626 --> 57:47.546
...he is using the Mariachi
to kill General Marquez.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.882
So you want to join us...

57:50.049 --> 57:51.884
...here's how it works.

57:52.051 --> 57:55.304
There is the bait. There is the trade.

57:55.472 --> 57:58.223
A favor for a favor.

57:59.893 --> 58:02.478
So El Mariachi is the trade?

58:03.730 --> 58:05.189
You are.

58:20.705 --> 58:22.080
This ain't my line of work.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.092
This guy's all fucked up.

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:28.040
General Marquez is arriving!

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:33.587
Bring out the Mariachi!

01:00:37.258 --> 01:00:40.260
Bring him out to the General!

01:00:57.612 --> 01:01:00.906
I didn't kill you before.
Enough blood had been shed.

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:04.368
But l see now...

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.287
that blood will spill again.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.460
General Marquez,
the Mariachi is not here.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.420
He escaped.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:17.923
You too will escape.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.065
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lore--

01:01:46.452 --> 01:01:48.078
Why?

01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.414
Practice shooting, not drinking.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.793
We are on.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:16.189
By order of the President, they
are searching all vehicles

01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:17.232
for guns and drugs.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.860
That fucker's been blockading
all the roads.

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.486
Take us back another way.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.991
By order of the President.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.493
Who does this guy think he is?

01:02:28.661 --> 01:02:30.495
He wants to get rid of me?

01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:32.330
Fine.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.374
I'll get rid of him.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:36.626
Replace him, even.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:41.590
Then I will simply disappear.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.763
Hey, vamonos, man.

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:05.155
Don't put me out completely.

01:03:09.243 --> 01:03:11.536
Have my men wait outside.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:59.084
Barillo and Dr. Guevera
must already be inside the building...

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:03.129
...having entered
through the back or basement.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:07.092
They should be midprocedure.

01:04:12.473 --> 01:04:13.974
Federal agents.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:17.936
This is going down now.

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:20.475
If Barillo wanted to look
unrecognizable to authorities...

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.686
...he succeeded.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:30.652
Massive tissue loss due to
an only partially completed...

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:35.657
...facial reconstruction wasn't
necessarily the cause of death.

01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:08.606
They switched bodies.

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:51.441
Barillo!

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.323
FBI.

01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:02.952
He was anyway.
Bring him along.

01:08:07.374 --> 01:08:10.043
Listen, l cannot do everything
by myself.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.128
I need someone
to go in there with me.

01:08:12.296 --> 01:08:15.215
No. I lost my inside man.
Probably dead.

01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:19.511
And Cucuy, greedy turd that he is,
ratted me out and has disappeared.

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:22.680
Plus, l'm pretty sure the cartel
is shadowing me.

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:27.602
Now, listen, I have got a swell bunch
of guys intercepting Marquez's army...

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.145
...but they've got no guns.

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:32.774
I want you to understand me.
This is no time to screw the pooch...

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:36.402
...because this is supposed to be
the big dance number, all right?

01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:37.904
Hello?

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.781
Hello? Are you there?

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.700
Okay, okay,
I'm going to freak right out.

01:08:56.423 --> 01:09:01.678
I would like the puerco pibil
and a tequila with lime.

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:12.397
Yeah, listen, I need a new line.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.149
This one's been compromised.

01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:17.402
Okay? Thank you.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:20.654
I'll be waiting here
at the La Vaca Volando.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.198
That's right.

01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:25.451
The Flying Cow.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:31.207
You really didn't see it coming,
did you?

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:51.955
Sorry, baby, I told you l wasn't
interested in your scheme.

01:10:52.122 --> 01:10:53.915
Too small.

01:10:56.835 --> 01:10:59.796
Oh, my Christ. ls that Barillo?

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:04.425
That's the new Barillo. The old Barillo
died in surgery a few hours ago.

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:07.679
What kind of cartel would have you
running its operation?

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.431
I'm his daughter.

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:16.688
You've been spying on my operation
for some time.

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:21.192
I feel it's only fair to warn you
that killing me is crossing the line...

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.946
...and you will have every marine
from here to Guantanamo Bay...

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:29.117
...up your keister, mister.
So just know that.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:34.831
Fortunately for you, nothing you did
is worth dying over.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:39.043
You have only seen too much.

01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:45.091
We are going to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

01:11:57.896 --> 01:12:00.273
On this day of the dead,

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.234
I offer you a chance for a new life.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.289
That sounded a little extreme
for a parade.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.333
Troops are coming up
from the south.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.918
-Whose?
-Emiliano Marquez.

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:25.006
-Well, what do we do?
-We stay here. This place is fortified.

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:29.969
It's much easier to defend this place
than to chance going out in the open.

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:33.973
Nicholas? What are you talking
about, "fortified"? Come here!

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:39.520
Just stay clear of those windows, sir.
You let me handle it.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:57.455
My name is Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:00.124
I work for the Central
Intelligence Agency.

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:02.877
I throw shapes. I throw shapes.

01:13:03.253 --> 01:13:06.547
I set them up. l watch them fall.

01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:14.472
I'm living la vida loca.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:32.407
No!

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:40.498
I'm terribly sorry about your
chewing gum, but listen.

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:42.708
I will give you this...

01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:48.214
...if you'll be my eyes.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:50.508
It's a dollar.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.009
I meant...

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.886
...this.

01:13:54.304 --> 01:13:57.140
I need you to take me
to the center of the city.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:00.017
Is someone following you?

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:03.813
It's difficult for me to tell right now
because l'm having a bad day.

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.065
Do you see someone?

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:10.194
Yes, he's getting close.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:14.240
Listen, have you ever seen
one of these?

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.203
Have you used one?

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.581
Don't ever,
because they're bad.

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:24.292
But what I need for you to do
is to aim this...

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:28.463
...at the bad man who's following us
and shoot him in the head.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.881
Kill him?

01:14:30.048 --> 01:14:33.718
Oh, yeah. Very matalo.
Close?

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:38.097
Okay. Smoke him.

01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:43.561
Smoke the fucker. Just send him
straight to fucking Broadway.

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:47.064
What?

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:50.318
Okay. Come here.

01:14:54.406 --> 01:14:55.907
Right or left?

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.373
Was that my right or your right?

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.482
Wrong man.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.944
Sorry.

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:50.336
Look me in the eyes...

01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:54.090
...and then kill me.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:15.903
Good boy. Now you're thinking.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:20.575
Take me to the center of the city,
where there will be even more dough.

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.849
For you...

01:16:46.059 --> 01:16:48.686
for our daughter...

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.732
for Mexico.

01:17:28.518 --> 01:17:32.647
In my past, l'd take on evil
from the bottom.

01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:35.566
Now I realize...

01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:37.401
...start at the top.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:42.114
The President is a good man.

01:17:43.575 --> 01:17:46.327
I'll go around back.
Meet me in five.

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:51.916
Watch him.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:05.304
We could torture him.

01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:09.141
He's FBI.

01:18:10.268 --> 01:18:12.103
He's retired.

01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:13.938
That doesn't count.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.694
I was tortured once.

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:21.320
I didn't like it.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.490
You know what the fucked up thing is?

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:27.410
They tore out my left nut.

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.958
That sort of turned me off of the
whole thing.

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.919
What should we do with him?

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.175
Let's go eat about it.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:59.316
Hey Snow White, watch that
fucking pig.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.581
Just lay low.
They'll leave us alone.

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:26.177
What the fuck?!

01:19:27.345 --> 01:19:29.513
I don't like military.

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:43.068
Get out.

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:45.696
-Why are we stopping?
-We can't go further.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:49.533
-Why not?
-Look out there. lt's a coup d'etat!

01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:53.454
I can't see, fuck-mook!
I have no eyes.

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.916
Well, then listen to it, fucker!

01:19:57.083 --> 01:20:01.545
The military's throwing over the
presidency. All hell's broken loose.

01:20:01.838 --> 01:20:04.131
You guys have to get out now.

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:13.849
Keep your money because
I'm not moving one inch.

01:21:56.828 --> 01:21:58.412
Fuck! Now what?

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:01.498
-Do you know armor-piercing bullets?
-Yeah.

01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:03.626
These are much better.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.901
What do you want in life?

01:22:31.029 --> 01:22:32.321
Good choice.

01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:45.542
-You ready?
-Yeah.

01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:46.919
Okay, let's go!

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.721
It's no longer safe to be here.
Let's go.

01:23:56.406 --> 01:23:58.991
You have a meeting
with General Marquez, sir.

01:24:51.002 --> 01:24:53.796
It feels like you need
some protection, sir.

01:24:56.841 --> 01:24:57.925
Who are you guys?

01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.011
Sons of Mexico, sir.

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:13.357
Are we in front of the building?

01:25:23.576 --> 01:25:24.618
Okay.

01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:28.789
This is it, kid.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:35.045
I don't hear you running.

01:27:07.513 --> 01:27:10.599
Why would they want me dead?
I've done nothing but help them.

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:13.769
What are you talking about?
Let me show you something.

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:15.896
Look out there! You see?

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:20.317
Well, don't look too close,
Presidente.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:23.695
But your people are out there
fighting for you, you understand?

01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:25.405
Take off your jacket.

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.491
-This also?
-Yes.

01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:29.451
Put this on.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:03.068
What is this, payoff?

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.279
This is money someone paid
to kill you.

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:08.365
And now it's money
to save your life, Presidente.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.576
Here, get some tequila for yourself.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.990
Leave here and lock the door.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:28:59.833
Carolina?

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:03.670
She died.

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:06.840
Your daughter?

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.801
She died.

01:29:11.929 --> 01:29:12.929
and you?

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:17.934
Dead.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.521
and l?

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:24.107
Alive and well.

01:29:40.249 --> 01:29:41.458
In hell.

01:29:58.434 --> 01:30:01.478
Everything in its place...

01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:08.837
You fucking little monkey.

01:31:09.547 --> 01:31:11.214
Stand up.

01:31:18.097 --> 01:31:20.056
See anything you like?

01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:35.489
No.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:05.060
Do you remember a man
named Archuleta?

01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:07.229
Why?

01:32:07.563 --> 01:32:12.234
I present to you Special Agent
Jorge Ramirez.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:19.783
You tortured and murdered
Agent Archuleta. He was my partner.

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:21.660
He was also my friend.

01:32:22.286 --> 01:32:27.165
Agent Ramirez, you have
to follow certain rules.

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:30.252
Oh, l'm retired.

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:34.381
Rules don't apply to me
any more than they do to you.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.967
-Mr. Chambers.
-Yes, sir.

01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:38.927
You're just going to stand there?

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:43.056
I'm afraid anything but standing's
gonna cost you extra.

01:32:47.436 --> 01:32:48.812
You leave me no choice.

01:33:56.213 --> 01:33:58.298
Did you get your man?

01:33:58.466 --> 01:33:59.716
One of them.

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:07.515
If that isn't interagency cooperation,
I just don't know what is.

01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:10.977
See you later.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.481
Fuck you.

01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:18.943
Are you okay?

01:34:20.112 --> 01:34:21.571
I don't know.

01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:24.824
You will be.

01:35:33.018 --> 01:35:36.479
What do you want in life?

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.025
To be free...

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.362
Simple.

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:48.366
No.
