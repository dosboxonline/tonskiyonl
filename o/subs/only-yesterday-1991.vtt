00:15.440 --> 00:19.797
Rouge cakes soon mould,
and the flowers wait for no one.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.958
No sooner are you done picking,
than they bloom again.

00:28.840 --> 00:34.073
When the rains come,
work continues into the early hours.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.749
Each day flew by,

00:39.120 --> 00:44.319
Pleasantly tired, I thought about
the flower-pickers of old.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.636
If I could've worked
like this as a child,

00:50.080 --> 00:54.756
my school essays would've been
really interesting.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.838
Mum, I need 5,000 yen.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.394
5,000 yen? I can't give you that.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.910
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.156
Are they that much?

01:21.160 --> 01:21.990
Nonsense.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.189
They're Pumas.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.070
- Pumas?
- It's a brand.

01:28.120 --> 01:32.671
I'm not sure.
There must be cheaper ones.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.717
How about the ones you've got?

01:34.880 --> 01:37.155
Nobody wears them now.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.273
Everyone's getting Pumas.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.555
Who's everyone?

01:41.680 --> 01:45.559
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.636
That's only four people.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.032
Everyone's wearing them!

01:51.160 --> 01:54.516
No. You never do your chores.

01:54.680 --> 01:58.878
Did you ask for a dress for
your Barbie Doll?

02:00.160 --> 02:03.755
Didn't you promise to ask only at
Christmas and your birthday?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.350
You always spoil her.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.193
Is that right, Taeko?

02:09.320 --> 02:13.074
All of a sudden,
the ten year-old me was back.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.152
But...

02:16.200 --> 02:19.954
Yaeko got a kimono and
it wasn't even her graduation.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.594
It's for tea-ceremony.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.156
You keep asking for
lots of little stuff,

02:25.320 --> 02:27.709
we get one or two big things.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.551
Right?

02:28.720 --> 02:29.835
Yep.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.870
Stop that.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.754
Always picky about food.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.869
Dad loves the onions, right?

02:43.800 --> 02:48.157
Anyway, that kimono will be
yours in the end.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.272
Always hand-me-downs.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.910
- Some people don't get anything.
- Exactly.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.918
Then give me that enamel purse.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.479
Didn't you give it to her yet?

02:58.640 --> 03:02.633
You're too old for that.
Give it to her.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.395
I don't want it.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.551
Keep the stupid purse.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.235
Then I won't give it to you.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.511
I'm not buying you a new one.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.430
Fine.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.750
Good. I actually really like it.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.673
I hate it.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.632
Ready for dinner. Take this away.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.075
See, has to be thrown away.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.071
What a waste.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.675
Don't throw it away! Please Mother.

03:43.840 --> 03:44.989
It's your fault.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.994
Finish it yourself next time.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.035
You three are so selfish.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.433
Father, buy me an enamel purse.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.954
Yaeko won't give me hers.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.838
You said you didn't want it.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.438
Yeah, but...

04:17.600 --> 04:20.113
You said it, you have to do it.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.636
Hurry up and get ready.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.670
I'll wear these!

04:36.400 --> 04:39.915
Why is Yaeko coming?

04:40.880 --> 04:45.635
You said it was just the three of us.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.632
Because I finished my homework.
Is that a problem?

04:51.240 --> 04:54.118
It's Chinese food.
The more the merrier.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.914
Grandma's not coming.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.600
She doesn't eat oily food.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.235
If you don't want to come, stay here.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.630
We're going Taeko.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.353
Come on slowpoke.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.395
I don't have a purse.

05:37.680 --> 05:41.355
Lend her that enamel one.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.030
Here.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.798
Ouch.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.759
Let's go.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.388
I'm not going.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.114
Okay. Let's go Mother.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.875
Stay with Grandma then.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.036
Not coming Taeko?

06:26.520 --> 06:27.635
No I'm not.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.274
We're off then.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.119
I'm coming too!

07:09.600 --> 07:10.874
No shoes!

07:15.520 --> 07:17.397
Father please.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.232
A button came off.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.557
We didn't go out, of course.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.995
My face was swollen and a cold towel

08:00.160 --> 08:02.390
didn't stop the stinging.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.434
That night I couldn't sleep

08:05.600 --> 08:08.273
wondering why it was always me.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.709
Figuring I must've been adopted

08:11.160 --> 08:13.628
I cried myself to sleep.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.432
Was it the first time he hit you?

08:17.560 --> 08:20.916
Yes, the first and only time.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.991
Dad slaps me often... well, sometimes.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.038
Maybe that's easier.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.755
When it's only once,
you can't stop thinking why.

08:34.520 --> 08:38.876
It's hard to imagine you
a selfish brat.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.753
A spoiled brat.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.673
I wasn't just fussy about
onions, either.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.472
Now I don't feel like I'm that bad.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.397
Wait a second!

08:51.520 --> 08:56.116
Your poor Mum.
I shouldn't encourage you.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.634
I'm giving up on the Pumas.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.994
Good girl.

09:06.360 --> 09:10.239
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.554
Hooray!

09:33.040 --> 09:34.155
Hey!

09:36.240 --> 09:37.673
100 yen each.

09:43.920 --> 09:44.670
Taeko...

09:44.800 --> 09:45.949
Tomorrow...

09:46.240 --> 09:49.516
Let's go for a drive to Zao.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.432
- Zao?
- Yes.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.396
You went to Yamadera
last year, right?

09:54.600 --> 09:56.511
The family said it was okay.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.394
The views at Zao were beautiful.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.878
But Zao had become famous
and touristy.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.875
How come you're not married?

10:36.040 --> 10:39.953
Do you find that strange?

10:40.200 --> 10:42.555
Well, no, not really.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.514
Lots of women work now.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.956
Most of my friends are single.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.872
Oh, is that right?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.274
That's right.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.794
I see.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.235
It's true.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.115
Right.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.391
Really. It's very common.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.999
Toshio?

11:07.240 --> 11:10.789
In elementary school, could you
do fractions?

11:12.880 --> 11:17.237
When they said reverse the numerator
and denominator, could you do it?

11:17.360 --> 11:20.033
I don't remember.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.153
I wasn't bad at math though.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.554
I see.

11:24.880 --> 11:25.949
Lucky you.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.072
I bet you don't remember
'cause it was easy.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.073
Maybe. Why do you ask?

11:32.800 --> 11:35.189
It seems that people who could do it

11:35.360 --> 11:37.828
went on to have easy lives.

11:39.560 --> 11:44.554
One girl, completely average
...not even good at math,

11:44.680 --> 11:47.990
always could do it perfect right away.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.953
She grew up really normal

11:51.200 --> 11:54.078
and now has two kids.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.319
I was no good at it.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.478
Not smart enough to know when to quit.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.713
Room 5, Taeko Okajima. 25 points

12:18.440 --> 12:21.318
Before the test...

12:21.680 --> 12:26.993
...we had art class.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.671
And... um... we did blow pictures.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.355
Blow pictures?

12:34.360 --> 12:38.114
Yes. We drop paint on the paper...

12:38.720 --> 12:42.190
and blow patterns in it.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.596
And?

12:46.120 --> 12:49.795
You blow like this,
really hard, right?

12:50.440 --> 12:51.634
Yes?

12:52.120 --> 12:57.319
So, I got a headache.
From blowing so hard.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.718
That's why you did so badly?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.519
That's right.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.115
I see.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.232
Do you know the answers now?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.672
The correct answers?

13:16.920 --> 13:18.035
Well...

13:18.800 --> 13:21.030
Have Yaeko help you with them.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.759
Yaeko?!

13:22.960 --> 13:24.188
That's right.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.872
Or Nanako, whichever.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.798
I'll ask Nanako.

13:52.320 --> 13:56.757
Nanako's not back yet.
Can I wait til after dinner?

14:05.640 --> 14:08.200
I'll ask Yaeko...

14:24.360 --> 14:25.873
Mother!

14:26.640 --> 14:28.437
Mother! Mother!

14:30.240 --> 14:32.037
What is this?!

14:32.720 --> 14:33.948
How on earth?

14:34.080 --> 14:37.868
Please teach her.
She doesn't seem to get it.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.791
But this is beyond belief!

14:42.920 --> 14:44.478
That's why I'm asking you...

14:44.640 --> 14:46.392
Is she alright in the head?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.437
Just help her.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.434
Normally this is easy.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.398
But that child's not normal!

15:07.240 --> 15:11.472
Taeko, your sister's going to help.

15:12.920 --> 15:17.152
You had a headache from blowing,
didn't you?

15:20.480 --> 15:21.674
Sit.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.277
Say your times table from the top.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.477
I know that.
I'm in fifth grade already!

15:32.160 --> 15:34.754
Then why so many mistakes?!

15:34.920 --> 15:37.354
It's dividing fractions.

15:43.480 --> 15:48.031
Just flip the top
and the bottom and multiply.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.515
They taught you that, right?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.111
Then why do you get it wrong?

15:54.400 --> 15:57.392
Yaeko, one step at a time.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.638
What's dividing a fraction
by a fraction anyway?

16:10.400 --> 16:15.315
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter means...

16:15.920 --> 16:19.230
how would this divide

16:19.640 --> 16:21.631
between four people, right?

16:24.880 --> 16:30.000
So, it's one, two, three,
four, five, six...

16:30.120 --> 16:32.111
one-sixth each, right?

16:34.240 --> 16:36.913
No, no, no, no. That's multiplication.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.511
How come it's less when you multiply?

16:41.080 --> 16:44.755
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter...

16:48.440 --> 16:49.350
Anyway!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.230
Forget about apples...

16:53.400 --> 16:57.678
just remember to inverse and multiply.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.915
Is her sister in Takarazuka?

17:08.079 --> 17:09.035
No, S. K. D.

17:10.079 --> 17:13.356
- She got "D" in math.
- "D"?

17:13.520 --> 17:16.432
Yes, and just barely.

17:18.880 --> 17:22.236
If she got half right,
it'd be worth scolding her.

17:22.359 --> 17:23.998
Right.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.589
Should you get her IQ checked?

17:27.760 --> 17:30.320
They said it was fine
when she started.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.998
Maybe she turned dumb?

17:32.160 --> 17:34.799
Remember she fell downstairs
as a baby?

17:34.920 --> 17:37.514
Right, in her walker!

17:37.800 --> 17:39.552
I thought she was dead.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.517
It was just a bump.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.033
It's affecting her now.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.718
That's it!

17:45.440 --> 17:49.638
Nonsense.
She's just no good at math.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.320
She chats too much in class.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.792
If she'd just listen,
even an idiot can do it.

17:56.960 --> 18:01.033
It's only two more years
until Junior High.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.709
Two-thirds of this apple,

18:04.840 --> 18:09.709
divided by a quarter...
I can't even picture it.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.997
Two-thirds of this,

18:12.200 --> 18:16.637
into a quarter makes it...

18:22.000 --> 18:27.120
Even now, dividing fractions
is difficult.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.632
We farmers give up too easily.

18:36.880 --> 18:41.749
We just yield to the flow and
follow what they do in the cities.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.639
Let's rethink the real
meaning of prosperity.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.588
Return to the old ways of farming.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.353
Wow...

18:53.240 --> 18:56.118
So, that explains the organic farming?

18:59.920 --> 19:02.798
I'm just quoting my friend.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.635
But I agree with it.

19:06.520 --> 19:11.071
It's great the way you hold onto
your memories of math class.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.391
It wasn't meant to impress you.

19:14.640 --> 19:19.714
People say you work
in a great place

19:20.000 --> 19:22.673
but I could never give myself
up to it completely.

19:22.840 --> 19:28.915
I really admire
your devotion to farming.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.875
You're being sarcastic?

19:33.480 --> 19:35.630
Of course not!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.155
There aren't many people like you.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.958
Farming's in total decline, right?

19:45.480 --> 19:49.439
So we can't just carry on as normal.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.154
We've got to think about the future.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.757
We help each other out,
cheer one another along,

19:56.920 --> 19:59.070
otherwise we can't keep it up.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.273
Taeko do you ski?

20:06.720 --> 20:10.349
I've been with friends a few times.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.354
Come next winter. I'll teach you.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.590
Are you good?

20:16.960 --> 20:21.192
No, but I'm an instructor there.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.437
An instructor? You must be great.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.792
All my friends are too. It's nothing.

20:49.920 --> 20:55.278
At last, we're in the
middle of nowhere.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.075
"Nowhere" huh?

20:58.240 --> 21:01.198
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.031
Interesting point though.

21:05.080 --> 21:09.710
City people see the trees and rivers

21:09.880 --> 21:12.713
and are grateful for "nature".

21:13.280 --> 21:17.990
But what you see here
is all made by man.

21:18.920 --> 21:19.909
By man?

21:20.120 --> 21:21.473
Farmers.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.877
- That wood?
- Yes.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.192
- Those trees?
- Yes.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.511
- That stream?
- Yes.

21:33.240 --> 21:37.358
Every bit has its history,
not just the fields and rice paddies,

21:37.720 --> 21:40.359
someone's Great-Great Grandpa
planted it, or cleared it,

21:40.480 --> 21:43.677
gathered firewood
or picked mushrooms there.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.990
I see.

21:46.840 --> 21:51.277
Mankind battles nature
and receives from it.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.233
They evolve together,
and create this scenery.

21:54.840 --> 21:58.719
So without man, this wouldn't exist?

22:00.320 --> 22:04.279
Farmers can't exist without nature.

22:05.120 --> 22:09.318
So they've always taken great care

22:09.440 --> 22:12.318
to give her a helping hand in return.

22:13.880 --> 22:18.158
A collaboration between
man and nature...

22:18.880 --> 22:21.110
That's the heart of country life.

22:21.960 --> 22:26.033
That's why I feel so at home.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.030
I didn't grow up here,
but somehow always felt...

22:29.200 --> 22:33.591
my soul was at home here.

22:34.560 --> 22:38.599
So that's it...

23:25.640 --> 23:27.949
My back aches.

23:28.880 --> 23:32.589
What's so great about organic farming?

23:33.840 --> 23:38.277
Only the theory. Like I said...

23:38.440 --> 23:41.750
giving nature a hand is hard work.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.118
Things haven't changed
in a hundred years.

23:45.440 --> 23:49.672
No, even "organic" rice
uses weed-killer.

23:49.800 --> 23:54.476
There's not enough labour
to weed by hand.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.515
You're really working hard.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.638
How about some tea?

24:03.080 --> 24:04.672
Fantastic.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.350
I felt like a break.

24:14.960 --> 24:19.476
Toshio let me try
a variety of things...

24:21.000 --> 24:24.675
...until I felt I knew
all about country life.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.153
That's great...

25:12.560 --> 25:16.838
"Behold, the crows fly home.
First one..."

25:19.520 --> 25:22.114
At last I can say this
in the right setting.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.678
It was my line in a school play.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.870
I was "Village Child A".

25:31.560 --> 25:33.391
Oh, I see.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.713
I only ever had small roles too.

25:37.880 --> 25:38.995
And you Naoko?

25:39.160 --> 25:44.234
Only lead roles,
since there are so few of us.

25:44.400 --> 25:49.030
These days people leave
and go to the cities.

25:49.200 --> 25:53.398
And now there are fewer kids.

25:53.560 --> 25:58.315
I see. But getting the big
roles must be fun.

25:58.560 --> 26:03.918
Not really. I prefer sports.
I'm a pretty fast runner.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.716
Good for you.
I was always mediocre.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.110
The sports version
of "Village Child A"

26:10.880 --> 26:15.078
Still, I'll never forget that line
as long as I live.

26:15.280 --> 26:19.512
It was going to make me a star.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.556
A star?

26:20.720 --> 26:21.596
Yes.

26:21.800 --> 26:22.835
What kind of star?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.228
That tiny role?

26:24.760 --> 26:25.636
Yes.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.316
Even though you weren't the lead?

26:28.720 --> 26:29.391
Yes.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.676
Because I was the most enthusiastic.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.799
Cause you were the cutest?

26:35.360 --> 26:37.316
No, not that!

26:38.000 --> 26:40.560
I rehearsed endlessly
in front of the mirror.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.792
Even for "Village Child A"...

26:44.000 --> 26:49.632
The line was so short,
I felt something missing.

26:49.960 --> 26:54.511
"Behold, the crows fly home.
First one..."

26:54.680 --> 26:56.875
I know. You made up more!

26:57.320 --> 26:58.594
Exactly.

27:00.360 --> 27:05.673
Look up there, the crows fly home.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.276
- First one...
- Then two...

27:09.440 --> 27:11.556
- Then three...
- Then four...

27:13.000 --> 27:16.276
Farewell dear crows.
You take care now.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.751
And your teacher loved it.

27:21.920 --> 27:22.636
Just the opposite.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.031
Very good everyone.

27:26.520 --> 27:30.672
But let's stick to the script.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.876
After all that.

27:44.040 --> 27:47.919
It wasn't a good line,
so I didn't mind.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.432
I wasn't discouraged at all.

27:51.760 --> 27:56.550
I realised that I could act
even when there were no lines.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.392
Behold, the crows fly home.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.310
- First one.
- Then two.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.550
- Then three.
- Then four.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.792
That was all.

28:36.840 --> 28:41.277
It was worth the effort.
"Village Child A" was a hit.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.431
Believe it or not.

28:44.160 --> 28:50.076
People asked if I'd had lessons.
Teachers praised me...

28:50.600 --> 28:53.717
Then something amazing happened.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.519
Anyone home?

28:58.840 --> 28:59.431
Coming.

28:59.600 --> 29:04.720
...and then the dynamite blew up
right in my face!

29:04.840 --> 29:06.319
...right in my face!

29:07.040 --> 29:08.439
What? Our Taeko?

29:12.800 --> 29:17.749
We need a girl to star
in our college play.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.279
As a service to the community,

29:22.440 --> 29:25.273
please let your daughter perform.

29:25.520 --> 29:26.748
A star!

29:27.720 --> 29:30.314
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.154
We wouldn't take too long.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.959
Well, but...

29:36.280 --> 29:39.431
Of course we'd bring her
straight home.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.638
I'll be in a real play.

29:41.760 --> 29:45.673
Not with a bunch of kids
but with real grown-ups!

29:46.240 --> 29:47.309
I'll be a star!

29:49.160 --> 29:56.475
Oh, oh, oh,
oh what a wonderful day

29:56.600 --> 30:02.596
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

30:15.360 --> 30:16.679
Mother!

30:17.600 --> 30:18.828
So? So?

30:19.040 --> 30:22.589
A nice boy from the university
wants you in their drama.

30:22.800 --> 30:26.190
You were so good
in the school play.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.953
And? And?

30:28.840 --> 30:32.913
He practically begged me!

30:39.640 --> 30:41.835
Wow that's great!

30:41.960 --> 30:44.076
At least you're good at something.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.800
She writes good essays too.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.636
She's certainly better at that
than she is at math.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.678
That's right. That's right.

30:53.800 --> 30:58.828
I was lead in "The Poor Sparrow"
but no one came for me.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.792
You see, you see!

31:01.240 --> 31:02.992
Are you going to do it?

31:25.640 --> 31:28.677
This could lead to a career.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.598
Join the Takarazuka Theatre.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.951
Start rehearsing now,
it's perfect timing.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.992
Acting is out.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.754
Show business people
are no good.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.239
"Show business"...
don't exaggerate...

31:45.400 --> 31:47.709
That's right. It's...

31:47.840 --> 31:49.068
I said no.

31:50.000 --> 31:50.591
Dinner.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.549
Father's so stubborn.

32:12.840 --> 32:16.435
Why did you have to
mention a career?

32:16.600 --> 32:19.558
- Can I bathe first?
- Sure.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.278
Or Takarazuka?

32:22.920 --> 32:26.276
Or show business?
You know Dad...

32:26.520 --> 32:30.593
Why did you say that Nanako?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.638
That's enough.

32:37.000 --> 32:46.079
Poor boy, poor boy,
Don't you feel sorry for me?

32:46.800 --> 32:49.360
We won't take much of her time.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.910
I know but...

32:52.960 --> 32:55.030
I beg you.

32:56.360 --> 32:59.477
She's rather shy...

33:00.480 --> 33:03.631
the timid type...

33:05.520 --> 33:09.957
Sorry you came so far for nothing.

33:10.120 --> 33:15.035
Poor boy, poor boy...

33:15.200 --> 33:19.671
...Such a long way from home...

33:20.160 --> 33:24.472
Poor boy

33:33.640 --> 33:38.236
Aoki's going to play the part instead.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.795
I see.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.751
She's boasting to everyone.

33:44.960 --> 33:45.836
I see.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.037
Today her Mum met her at school

33:49.200 --> 33:53.512
to get her changed into a fancy dress.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.712
A frilly thing out to here...

33:58.240 --> 34:03.633
Don't tell anyone
you got the first offer.

34:05.800 --> 34:09.429
Because that would hurt
Aoki very much.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.309
Do you understand?

34:18.560 --> 34:19.389
Do you understand?

34:48.760 --> 34:51.877
Breaking through the waves

34:53.800 --> 34:56.712
Shooting through the clouds

34:58.720 --> 35:04.431
Where is it heading, Hyokkori Pumpkin
Island? Where will it take us?

35:09.120 --> 35:13.989
Something special waits for us,

35:14.120 --> 35:18.716
just over the horizon

35:18.840 --> 35:23.914
There'll be hard times,
there'll be sad times,

35:24.200 --> 35:26.350
but we'll never lose heart

35:26.520 --> 35:28.431
We hate to cry,
so let's laugh instead

35:28.880 --> 35:31.633
Let's go!

35:31.800 --> 35:36.794
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!

35:54.000 --> 35:56.309
Poor you.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.389
I joined the drama group
in high school.

36:02.840 --> 36:06.799
I couldn't forget what had happened.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.070
And then?

36:08.840 --> 36:12.037
It was a lot of fun, acting and all...

36:13.120 --> 36:17.875
but it wasn't for me.
As for becoming a star...

36:18.000 --> 36:19.956
that was a joke.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.434
But...

36:23.200 --> 36:27.716
I guess Dads are the same all over.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.553
When I was in high school,
I so wanted to live in Tokyo.

36:36.720 --> 36:41.191
I even wrote to my cousin
about schools there.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.758
Did you really?

36:45.040 --> 36:48.430
I gave up. But it annoyed me

36:48.600 --> 36:52.115
to hear other guys
bragging about life in Tokyo.

36:53.360 --> 36:57.035
Not anymore though.
I respect my Dad...

36:57.200 --> 36:59.111
He's an expert farmer.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.754
But I know how you felt.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.354
Mine's just a funny story.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.511
No it's the same, I understand.

37:12.160 --> 37:17.234
But we'll never lose heart, we hate
to cry, so let's laugh instead.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.791
I also watched
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.

37:20.200 --> 37:20.996
Really?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.517
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.358
He was my hero!

37:26.360 --> 37:27.873
Of course.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.396
Those songs were full
of encouragement.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.994
What was that other one?

37:34.160 --> 37:38.199
"If today's no good,
you'll have tomorrow"

37:38.760 --> 37:41.035
"If tomorrow's no good,
you'll have the next day"

37:41.480 --> 37:43.630
"If that's no good,
there'll be another"

37:43.800 --> 37:46.268
"There's always a tomorrow"

37:49.840 --> 37:50.989
What a weird song!

37:53.360 --> 37:58.354
That song, about putting things off,
Toshio took

37:58.480 --> 38:01.836
in a positive, affirmative way.

38:02.640 --> 38:06.076
I liked his approach to life.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.190
You're going tomorrow?

38:23.840 --> 38:28.675
Thank you for having me for so long.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.637
Thank you, my dear.

38:36.720 --> 38:40.030
Do you like it here?

38:40.200 --> 38:44.398
Very much. I feel so at home.

38:44.520 --> 38:47.830
Glad to hear it.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.312
I've lived here all my life.

38:51.760 --> 38:57.198
Been to Tokyo just once.
For your sister's wedding.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.198
You think it's better than Tokyo?

39:00.600 --> 39:02.397
Without a doubt.

39:02.760 --> 39:08.073
Tokyo's packed with cars, buildings...
People shouldn't live like that.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.352
This is a different world.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.553
You really like it here then?

39:15.680 --> 39:19.753
Yes. The nice surroundings,
the kind people...

39:23.200 --> 39:24.713
Taeko.

39:25.560 --> 39:29.030
Why don't you live here? With Toshio?

39:31.560 --> 39:37.430
Since his brother moved to Tokyo,

39:37.600 --> 39:42.071
why don't you stay here
and marry Toshio?

39:42.200 --> 39:43.394
Granny!

39:43.560 --> 39:46.677
Mother... you've gone too far!

39:46.840 --> 39:49.195
Taeko's shocked.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.517
Please think it over.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.311
Don't pay any attention. She's joking.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.672
Joking, right, Granny?

39:57.800 --> 40:00.314
No. I'm serious.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.994
Don't deny you wouldn't like it.

40:03.120 --> 40:07.159
It's not a matter of what we'd like...

40:07.280 --> 40:09.919
Of course we'd love it.

40:10.040 --> 40:15.273
But Taeko's a city person.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.350
Of course.

40:16.520 --> 40:20.354
But she loves it here,

40:20.480 --> 40:24.712
she works so hard on the land,
it's a joy to watch.

40:24.920 --> 40:29.038
There'd be nothing better
than her marrying Toshio.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.914
You're being rude.
You're embarrasing her.

40:33.640 --> 40:38.634
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.
Besides, she's older than him.

40:38.800 --> 40:42.554
There are jobs in Yamagata too.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.077
Please don't be angry.

40:47.480 --> 40:51.712
Most of the young wives
work these days, so...

40:51.880 --> 40:54.997
What're you talking about?

40:55.480 --> 41:00.076
She's only been here
twice on holiday.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.754
Suddenly bringing this up...
you're upsetting her.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.876
So you're against it?

41:05.000 --> 41:09.357
I didn't say that.
I said let's be realistic.

41:09.520 --> 41:13.638
We don't even know
how Toshio feels.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.598
One look at him and it's obvious.

41:16.720 --> 41:22.238
Don't dismiss it before
we've asked her.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.439
Taeko!

41:29.920 --> 41:31.512
Let her be.

41:33.960 --> 41:38.238
See what you did.
You can't rush these things.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.873
I don't think I was wrong.

41:56.080 --> 42:00.392
I'd never even thought
of being a farmer's wife.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.790
I was strangely moved,

42:04.920 --> 42:06.831
even imagining it might be possible.

42:08.120 --> 42:12.033
If only I could've replied:

42:12.200 --> 42:14.555
"I'd love to..." like in a movie.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.113
But I couldn't.

42:18.520 --> 42:22.593
Suddenly my love of the country,
and my play-farming,

42:22.960 --> 42:24.951
seemed so phony.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.829
Declaring my love for country life

42:30.000 --> 42:33.709
based on a ten day vacation,
now felt so embarrassing.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.874
Then with no warning...

42:39.080 --> 42:41.548
everyone seeing right through me.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.752
It was unbearable.

42:51.600 --> 42:52.999
I ain't shaking hands with you.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.713
That shirt he wore today...

42:58.840 --> 42:59.511
What about it?

42:59.640 --> 43:02.234
Tanaka's old shirt.

43:02.440 --> 43:03.634
Don't tell anyone.

43:03.800 --> 43:09.238
When it's his turn to feed the ducks,
he takes the bread home.

43:09.360 --> 43:12.557
Did you see his hands?

43:12.680 --> 43:14.398
Glad he's not sitting next to me.

43:15.080 --> 43:16.433
Poor Taeko.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.869
Have him switch places.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.390
He should sit with the boys.

43:22.560 --> 43:23.993
Right Taeko?

43:24.880 --> 43:27.838
I don't mind.

43:28.120 --> 43:30.190
You shouldn't talk like that.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.953
You don't mind?

43:32.120 --> 43:33.633
Don't be a goody-goody.

43:34.120 --> 43:36.918
Don't you dare tell anyone
what we said.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.999
I'll beat you up!

43:50.120 --> 43:51.314
Don't go!

44:03.760 --> 44:05.352
What are you doing out here?

44:06.080 --> 44:09.038
Nothing. Taking a walk.

44:09.200 --> 44:13.512
You're getting wet. Quick, get in.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.952
A little souvenir.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.353
Some of Mum's pickles.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.150
Please don't go back yet.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.508
Why not?

44:43.680 --> 44:46.672
Just drive... anywhere.

44:47.240 --> 44:48.639
Something wrong?

44:49.560 --> 44:53.758
I knew a boy named Abe.

44:55.360 --> 44:59.399
He came from another school.
He sat next to me.

45:01.040 --> 45:02.632
He once said,

45:03.640 --> 45:06.029
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

45:30.120 --> 45:35.752
His family was poor.
He never had sports gear.

45:36.640 --> 45:41.077
Always picking his nose
or wiping it on his sleeve...

45:41.240 --> 45:46.792
And if I complained or
even dared frown at him,

45:46.920 --> 45:50.117
he'd threaten to hit me.

45:51.720 --> 45:56.589
I hated it. I longed for
the end of the term,

45:56.880 --> 45:58.791
so we could change seats.

46:00.360 --> 46:04.512
I hated holding hands
in dance class,

46:05.160 --> 46:09.233
hated having to lend him
my homework.

46:11.800 --> 46:16.794
The girls gossipped
and called him names.

46:18.200 --> 46:22.352
But I wouldn't join in.

46:22.880 --> 46:27.431
I thought it was terrible
to talk behind his back.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.355
But one day...

46:31.320 --> 46:35.677
He was transferred in
the middle of the term.

46:36.720 --> 46:41.157
The teacher made us all
shake hands and say goodbye.

46:42.680 --> 46:45.752
A feeling of disgust swept the room.

46:48.240 --> 46:52.153
His hands were filthy.

46:54.080 --> 46:59.200
Walking around,
shaking hands with us,

46:59.600 --> 47:01.556
he looked so nervous.

47:04.200 --> 47:08.716
Back at his own desk,
only I was left.

47:11.440 --> 47:16.150
When I held out my hand he said,

47:17.960 --> 47:19.871
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

47:22.880 --> 47:25.155
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

47:33.080 --> 47:36.550
I hated him the most.

47:38.520 --> 47:41.637
He knew that.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.150
That's why he didn't shake my hand.

47:52.440 --> 47:54.431
What happened at the farmhouse?

47:55.120 --> 47:59.591
Ever since I was little...

48:01.480 --> 48:03.471
I just pretend to be nice.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.833
Nothing's changed.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.950
You're strange, today.
Not the usual you.

48:22.720 --> 48:24.870
I don't know what happened, but...

48:25.120 --> 48:28.749
It's nothing to do with that.

48:32.840 --> 48:34.193
I'm sorry.

48:35.560 --> 48:40.475
I just feel bad about what happened.

48:42.960 --> 48:47.078
I think that boy was stupid.

48:47.440 --> 48:52.036
Maybe he didn't shake your hand
because he liked you.

48:52.160 --> 48:56.517
No, he liked the class president.

48:56.680 --> 48:58.511
He was always acting tough with me.

48:58.680 --> 49:06.360
Hands in pockets, spitting,
swearing, swaggering along,

49:06.880 --> 49:08.598
...showing off.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.153
Exactly.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.836
I know how he feels.
When I was little,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.468
I used to bully the girl I liked.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.312
That's not it.

49:18.480 --> 49:22.678
He shook hands with everyone but me.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.873
There's the problem.

49:26.800 --> 49:29.394
Girls never understand how boys feel.

49:30.160 --> 49:31.957
As if you know...

49:32.400 --> 49:34.470
Let me guess, then...

49:35.280 --> 49:38.431
He wasn't that tough.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.120
He couldn't bully any boys.
He had no friends.

49:46.760 --> 49:51.390
You sat next to him, an easy target.

49:52.040 --> 49:54.873
He needed you to be tough with.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.754
No way he wanted
to shake hands with everyone.

49:58.880 --> 50:04.034
He could only prove how
tough he was with you.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.437
Don't be filthy!

51:13.080 --> 51:17.631
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him

51:18.400 --> 51:20.550
that I began copying him.

51:22.680 --> 51:24.477
Too late though, huh?

51:24.720 --> 51:27.473
I couldn't take back

51:27.680 --> 51:30.433
the pain I caused him.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.753
It's stopped raining.

51:42.440 --> 51:43.953
Oh, yes.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.039
The moon's out.

52:00.040 --> 52:03.715
Sometimes at night
you see raccoons here.

52:05.920 --> 52:07.069
Shall we go back?

52:07.200 --> 52:11.113
They must be worried about me.

52:14.200 --> 52:17.590
This'll be the talk of the town.

52:18.120 --> 52:21.476
I'm sorry. You've been so kind.

52:22.320 --> 52:24.914
I wonder what happened
at the house, though?

52:25.040 --> 52:29.636
Please, for my sake,
don't ask anyone.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.310
Shall I play that music?

53:12.560 --> 53:15.870
I began to think of
my feelings for him,

53:16.360 --> 53:21.388
and of his feelings for me,
for the very first time.

53:25.280 --> 53:31.230
How come he seemed to sort out
my mixed-up thoughts?

53:32.000 --> 53:36.357
How come I let him get so close?

53:37.880 --> 53:41.714
Somehow he seemed older than me.

53:42.960 --> 53:48.830
He was the one I wanted
to shake hands with.

53:51.480 --> 53:52.959
Just shake hands?

54:24.040 --> 54:25.837
What was this feeling?

54:27.200 --> 54:31.398
My mind raced as I sat beside him.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.316
Have you got everything?

54:59.440 --> 55:01.078
Yes, I'm fine.

55:01.320 --> 55:03.356
We'll see you in the winter.

55:03.520 --> 55:07.195
I'll do my farming homework.

55:07.320 --> 55:09.470
What about skiing?

55:09.880 --> 55:12.110
That just takes practice.

55:12.680 --> 55:15.717
Consider what I said, Taeko.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.194
What's that?

55:17.360 --> 55:17.997
What?

55:18.440 --> 55:22.035
That's our secret.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.837
Something was strange yesterday.

55:25.960 --> 55:29.191
Sorry. Next time I'll be fine,

55:29.320 --> 55:31.993
I'll leave the ten year-old me,
at home.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.432
Wait for me!

55:47.640 --> 55:49.358
Take care Naoko.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.634
Goodbye.

56:38.320 --> 56:45.510
Some say love, it is a river

56:46.400 --> 56:51.713
that drowns the tender reed.

56:53.440 --> 56:59.754
Some say love, it is a razor

57:01.680 --> 57:07.471
that leaves your soul to bleed.

57:08.840 --> 57:15.154
Some say love, it is a hunger,

57:16.960 --> 57:22.830
an endless aching need.

57:24.320 --> 57:31.431
I say love, it is a flower,

57:32.640 --> 57:38.795
and you its only seed.

57:43.600 --> 57:50.233
It's the heart, afraid of breaking,

57:51.480 --> 57:57.430
that never learns to dance.

57:58.280 --> 58:04.879
It's the dream, afraid of waking,

58:05.920 --> 58:12.109
that never takes a chance.

58:13.000 --> 58:19.678
It's the one who won't be taken.

58:20.880 --> 58:27.513
Who cannot seem to give.

58:28.600 --> 58:35.472
And the soul, afraid of dyin',

58:36.800 --> 58:43.638
that never learns to live.

58:47.480 --> 58:54.113
When the night has been too lonely

58:55.440 --> 59:00.912
and the road has been too long,

59:02.400 --> 59:08.873
And you think that love is only

59:10.040 --> 59:16.479
for the lucky and the strong,

59:17.040 --> 59:24.833
Just remember in the winter

59:25.000 --> 59:31.235
far beneath the bitter snows.

59:32.720 --> 59:39.990
Lies the seed,
that with the sun's love,

59:41.320 --> 59:49.079
in the Spring becomes the Rose.
