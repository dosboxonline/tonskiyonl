00:22.773 --> 00:24.857
(gunshot)

00:47.464 --> 00:50.717
(woman over tannoy)
Su caballo ha sido el favorito...

00:50.801 --> 00:53.469
...de las más importantes competiciones.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.472
Don Piquillo tiene cinco años.

00:56.598 --> 01:01.144
Maní, como dije, tiene muchas medallas
ganadas en competiciones.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.816
Alvarado sufrió
una caída el año pasado...

01:06.900 --> 01:10.069
...en las competiciones
de Río de Janeiro...

01:10.154 --> 01:13.740
...lo que no le permitió saltar
durante algunos meses.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.827
Pero con todo esto, él sigue siendo...

01:37.181 --> 01:41.350
- You didn't say there'd be such security.
- They moved the flight forward.

01:41.477 --> 01:44.103
We'll have to go ahead
as planned anyway.

01:44.897 --> 01:47.398
Toro? Sounds like a load of bull.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.525
James!

01:51.945 --> 01:53.821
Please be careful.

02:02.706 --> 02:07.251
¡Escuadrón, atención, al trote!

02:07.336 --> 02:11.214
- Un, dos, un, dos...
- Apunten al objetivo.

02:22.643 --> 02:27.230
Uno, dos. Vamos, vamos.
Muévanse, muévanse, deprisa.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.956
- Coronel.
- ¡Continúa!

02:45.040 --> 02:46.457
Sí.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.668
Argh!

03:06.603 --> 03:09.313
Well, it's a small world! You're a Toro, too!

03:09.398 --> 03:12.733
- ¡Interrogación!
- Sí, coronel. Métalo al camión.

03:16.947 --> 03:20.992
(woman over tannoy) Y ahora,
el capitán Alvarado va a saludar.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.141
(shouting)

04:31.229 --> 04:33.189
(sirens)

04:33.273 --> 04:35.358
Gracias, querida.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.778
I'll see you in Miami.

04:50.374 --> 04:51.832
(car horn)

05:25.784 --> 05:27.118
(shouting)

05:30.205 --> 05:32.123
¡El inglés escapó!

05:36.920 --> 05:40.423
- Alerta, preparen el fuego.
- Apunten, ¡fuego!

06:27.637 --> 06:30.973
¡Cierren la puerta!

07:02.464 --> 07:04.548
(beeping)

07:28.907 --> 07:30.074
Fill her up, please.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.453
(All Time High playing)

07:39.376 --> 07:43.045
All I wanted was a sweet distraction

07:43.130 --> 07:45.840
For an hour or two

07:46.716 --> 07:50.427
Had no intention to do

07:51.555 --> 07:54.849
The things we've done

07:57.519 --> 08:01.188
Funny how it always goes with love

08:01.273 --> 08:04.650
When you don't look, you find

08:04.734 --> 08:08.571
But then we're two of a kind

08:09.573 --> 08:13.075
We move as one

08:13.827 --> 08:18.164
We're an all time high

08:18.248 --> 08:22.751
We'll change all that's gone before

08:22.836 --> 08:27.256
Doing so much more

08:27.340 --> 08:31.844
Than falling in love

08:31.928 --> 08:36.265
On an all time high

08:36.349 --> 08:40.269
We'll take on the world and win

08:41.270 --> 08:43.981
So hold on tight

08:44.065 --> 08:46.692
Let the flight

08:46.776 --> 08:50.946
Begin

08:51.948 --> 08:55.784
I don't want to waste a waking moment

08:55.869 --> 08:59.163
I don't want to sleep

08:59.247 --> 09:03.125
I'm in so strong and so deep

09:04.127 --> 09:07.630
And so are you

09:09.966 --> 09:13.719
In my time I've said these words before

09:13.803 --> 09:17.473
But now I realise

09:17.557 --> 09:21.477
My heart was telling me lies

09:21.978 --> 09:25.648
For you they're true

09:26.316 --> 09:30.819
We're an all time high

09:30.904 --> 09:35.366
We'll change all that's gone before

09:35.450 --> 09:39.870
Doing so much more

09:39.955 --> 09:44.375
Than falling in love

09:44.459 --> 09:48.921
On an all time high

09:49.005 --> 09:53.842
We'll take on the world and win

09:53.927 --> 09:56.845
So hold on tight

09:56.930 --> 09:59.223
Let the flight

09:59.307 --> 10:01.850
Begin

10:03.186 --> 10:05.938
So hold on tight

10:06.022 --> 10:08.357
Let the flight

10:08.441 --> 10:10.985
Begin

10:11.820 --> 10:20.160
We're an all time high

10:42.976 --> 10:45.477
(band playing marching tune)

11:15.383 --> 11:17.051
(leaves rustling)

11:36.988 --> 11:39.073
(balloon bursts)

12:19.948 --> 12:21.824
Argh!

13:02.365 --> 13:04.950
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.744
We should go, my dear.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.896
Well...

13:33.980 --> 13:36.648
I must say,
you become more beautiful every day.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.651
- I'm over here!
- Of course you are!

13:39.736 --> 13:43.113
This is Miss Penelope Smallbone,
my new assistant.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.073
Miss Smallbone.

13:45.158 --> 13:50.996
What can I say, Moneypenny? Except that
she is as attractive and as charming...

13:51.080 --> 13:53.457
- As I used to be?
- I didn't say that.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.709
You're such a flatterer, James.

13:55.793 --> 14:00.506
Moneypenny, you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.050
So you've told me.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.679
- Welcome to Universal Exports.
- Take it, dear.

14:07.764 --> 14:11.475
- That's all you'll ever get from him.
- Thank you, Commander Bond.

14:11.559 --> 14:15.354
- Do you know me?
- Miss Moneypenny described you.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.106
In nauseating detail.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.192
Really?

14:20.568 --> 14:24.154
I can see you're going
to fit in here very nicely.

14:27.742 --> 14:30.744
- Ah, good morning, 007.
- Morning, sir.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.704
- Minister.
- Commander.

14:32.789 --> 14:36.041
I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.085
- Yes. Hello, Jim.
- James.

14:38.461 --> 14:42.047
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a Fabergé egg, sir.

14:42.131 --> 14:46.468
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Fabergé
as a gift for the Russian royal family.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.472
They're priceless and, uh... And very rare.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.226
This one contains a model
of the imperial state coach.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.144
- Top marks, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.313
Except it's a fake.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.651
There's the real thing. It's being
auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.654
This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.823
It's from none of the usual sources.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.659
Anonymous seller,
numbered Swiss bank account.

15:10.785 --> 15:14.496
I'd say that the vendor was a Russian.

15:14.914 --> 15:19.251
And now this turns up.
A near-perfect forgery.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.421
I think Commander Bond
should accompany you to the sale.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.841
Splendid!
I could use an extra pair of eyes!

15:25.925 --> 15:28.010
We could try and spot the seller.

15:28.094 --> 15:32.681
They usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.017
Thank you, Fanning.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.185
Not at all.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.774
If it is the Russians,
it may be an effort to raise currency

15:42.859 --> 15:45.861
for covert operations abroad
or for payoffs.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.615
Either way,
we'd better find out what they're up to.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.618
- Yes, Minister.
- Eyes only, 007.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.911
Operation Trove.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.205
You'll be replacing 009.

15:57.498 --> 16:02.169
He turned up dead in East Germany
with that egg in his hand.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.421
There's not much to go on.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.132
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.885
"Property of a Lady."

16:10.386 --> 16:12.471
The next subject on the agenda

16:12.555 --> 16:15.682
is the continuing mutual
disarmament talks with NATO.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.353
I assume you've all read
General Gogol's report.

16:20.063 --> 16:23.315
It seems very thorough.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.984
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

16:26.069 --> 16:29.988
I believe I express the opinion
of everyone present

16:30.073 --> 16:36.495
that adoption of NATO proposals does
not compromise our defensive position.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.498
(clears throat) Uh, Comrade Chairman!

16:39.582 --> 16:42.000
General Orlov.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.170
Er, General Gogol is presumptuous.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.173
He speaks for himself and others

16:48.257 --> 16:52.010
who cling to timid, outdated

16:52.095 --> 16:55.263
and unrealistic policies!

16:55.390 --> 16:58.767
Must I remind you, the committee,

16:58.851 --> 17:03.939
of our overwhelming superiority
over NATO forces

17:04.065 --> 17:06.108
before we give it away?

17:15.952 --> 17:18.954
In East Germany
under my direct command,

17:19.079 --> 17:24.792
I have 31 divisions,
including 11 tank divisions

17:24.877 --> 17:27.713
and another five in Czechoslovakia.

17:27.797 --> 17:32.801
In support, on the Russian western
border are 60 divisions,

17:32.927 --> 17:36.555
including 22 tank divisions.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.808
In all, a 10-1 advantage.

17:41.978 --> 17:48.400
American and West German forces
can field at most ten armoured divisions.

17:48.484 --> 17:52.654
The British maintain only a token force.

17:54.157 --> 17:58.994
We have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new Kutuzov computer

17:59.120 --> 18:05.584
and find that a lightning thrust by
ten armoured divisions from the north,

18:05.668 --> 18:08.754
and by five more
through Czechoslovakia,

18:08.838 --> 18:13.008
lead to total victory in five days

18:13.134 --> 18:17.345
against any possible defence scenario!

18:18.181 --> 18:20.599
This is absolute madness!

18:20.683 --> 18:22.726
We know where it will end.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.480
NATO will counterattack
with nuclear weapons.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.106
Never!

18:28.191 --> 18:31.777
The West is decadent and divided.

18:31.861 --> 18:35.530
It has no stomach
to risk our atomic reprisals.

18:36.157 --> 18:41.870
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.372
I see no reason to risk war

18:44.499 --> 18:49.377
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.965
We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic problems.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.803
- General Gogol, let me remind you...
- Comrades, sit down!

18:57.887 --> 19:00.472
- I wish to tell you...
- Both of you!

19:02.809 --> 19:06.061
World socialism
will be achieved peaceably.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.314
- Our military role is strictly defensive.
- Da.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.317
Is that understood, General Orlov?

19:16.405 --> 19:19.157
General Gogol, would you continue?

19:20.493 --> 19:25.664
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. I will
now turn to the specifics of my report...

19:25.748 --> 19:29.584
Tell him I will be there
as quickly as possible.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.854
Please! Please!

19:48.938 --> 19:51.439
- I am trying to concentrate!
- (Orlov) Lenkin!

19:54.610 --> 19:57.529
- What is it?
- It's terrible news, Comrade General!

19:57.613 --> 20:01.116
The reproduction
has been stolen in transit.

20:01.242 --> 20:04.953
The thief was dealt with,
but the egg was lost in the river.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.708
Your incompetence will destroy us all!

20:09.792 --> 20:13.628
- We'll have a replacement made.
- There is no time, Comrade General!

20:13.713 --> 20:17.716
I have just been informed of
an unscheduled inventory in two days!

20:17.800 --> 20:19.634
Control yourself, Lenkin!

20:19.760 --> 20:24.306
I'll tell our London people
we must have the genuine egg back.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.978
I hope we can reach them in time.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.147
(bangs gavel) Sold to Busoni!

20:35.985 --> 20:38.987
The next lot is number 48.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.991
A superb green-gold
Imperial Easter egg by Carl Fabergé.

20:43.409 --> 20:47.495
Enamelled in translucent green,
enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.

20:47.622 --> 20:51.833
Set with blue sapphires and
four petalled gold flowers with diamonds.

20:51.918 --> 20:57.505
- How much should it fetch?
- £250-300,000. Anything more'd be crazy.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.009
...used by Tsar Nicholas
in 1897 in Moscow.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.803
Property of a Lady.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.265
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.

21:07.350 --> 21:11.353
She wouldn't have to be here in person.
She could be represented by proxy.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.856
I'll start it at £150,000.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.652
150, 60.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.613
170. 170.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.825
180, 190.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.495
200. Against you, madam.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.374
- Any more?
- Now there is a lady.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.626
£220,000!

21:34.710 --> 21:36.461
240.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.130
James, stick to the business in hand.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.967
£260,000.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.802
280!

21:43.886 --> 21:45.887
£300,000!

21:46.722 --> 21:49.057
And 20?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.691
Are you bidding, sir?

21:58.901 --> 22:02.153
£320,000. New bidder!

22:02.571 --> 22:05.323
- That's interesting.
- You know him?

22:05.408 --> 22:09.327
- Mm. Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.
- £340,000. 360.

22:09.412 --> 22:12.580
Marginal quality from dubious sources.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.500
£380,000.

22:15.584 --> 22:19.421
- 400 in the centre.
- Well, that should do it.

22:19.505 --> 22:23.008
- Kamal has gone over the top.
- Your bid, sir. 400,000.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.844
400,000! Any more?

22:26.470 --> 22:29.055
- 425! New bidder.
- (gasping)

22:29.432 --> 22:31.516
Thank you, sir.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.187
- 425!
- Have you gone mad?

22:37.023 --> 22:39.274
Let's see how badly he wants it.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.693
450?

22:43.612 --> 22:45.530
450. 475?

22:47.283 --> 22:49.868
The bid is 450. 475?

22:56.625 --> 23:00.462
Against you, sir. No more than 450.

23:01.547 --> 23:05.967
- Er, Jim?
- The bid is £450,000.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.552
(gasps)

23:07.636 --> 23:09.471
I have 475.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.392
- £500,000.
- (gasping)

23:14.477 --> 23:16.144
£500,000.

23:17.313 --> 23:20.482
I have half a million pounds. All done?

23:22.068 --> 23:24.152
Any more?

23:25.946 --> 23:28.740
Yours, sir, for £500,000!

23:29.575 --> 23:33.036
- The next lot is...
- We could have been stuck with it.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.539
- I doubt it. He had to buy it.
- But why?

23:36.624 --> 23:38.917
That's what I intend to find out.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.788
You had no business bidding for that egg!

24:17.665 --> 24:20.041
What would you have done if you'd got it?

24:20.126 --> 24:23.461
I would have claimed it was a fake, sir,
and not paid.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.964
Not paid?

24:26.048 --> 24:30.635
Here's the original. I switched it
with the fake during the auction.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.804
Good God!

24:34.557 --> 24:37.308
And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?

24:37.393 --> 24:41.396
Well, he... He complains.
If he's legitimate.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.815
- Well?
- I don't think he will complain.

24:43.899 --> 24:47.902
According to Fanning,
this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.572
I believe that the fake will smoke him out.

24:50.698 --> 24:53.992
Our tail followed him to Heathrow
where he got a plane to Delhi.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.578
Hm. You must go there, too.

24:57.371 --> 25:01.833
I'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station I,
to keep him under surveillance.

25:01.917 --> 25:06.421
- Book yourself on the next flight out.
- Well, I've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.924
- Oh, Bond?
- Sir?

25:10.009 --> 25:15.180
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.
It's government property now.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.932
Of course, sir.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.901
(traditional tune)

26:16.408 --> 26:18.493
(plays the Bond theme)

26:26.835 --> 26:29.462
That's a charming tune.
You do take English money?

26:29.546 --> 26:31.756
Only gold sovereigns.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.133
Please.

26:35.010 --> 26:38.096
I'm Vijay.
Special expediter, Universal Exports.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.057
- Welcome to India, Commander Bond.
- Call me James.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.977
- Where's Sadruddin?
- Over here, waiting in the taxi.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.771
This was the wrong cover. I hate snakes!

26:47.439 --> 26:50.149
Taxi! Please be comfortable.

26:53.028 --> 26:56.364
- I am Sadruddin, Head of Section.
- How do you do?

26:56.490 --> 26:59.534
- I booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel.
- Good. My luggage?

26:59.660 --> 27:01.703
Gone ahead.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.544
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?

27:09.628 --> 27:13.715
Exiled Afghan prince.
Sportsman - polo, cricket, tennis.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.717
- I play a bit myself.
- Really?

27:15.801 --> 27:20.305
As a matter of fact, I've got
a part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.891
- What have you learned so far?
- My backhand's improved.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.357
(Sadruddin) Kamal lives there on the hill.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.694
The Monsoon Palace. It's heavily guarded.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.238
How do I get to him?

27:37.323 --> 27:40.908
He plays backgammon most evenings
at the hotel casino.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.745
As a guest,
you're automatically a member.

27:43.871 --> 27:48.416
- Then let's meet there later.
- I'll change into something less casual.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.211
Oh, here. You may need this
to play with your asp.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.688
Good morning. Name's Bond.
I believe you have a reservation.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.940
- We've been expecting you.
- Good.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.109
I hope you have a pleasant stay.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.945
I'm sure I will.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.785
Thank you.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.914
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.541
Oh, thank you!

28:30.626 --> 28:32.960
If I can be of further assistance...

28:34.046 --> 28:36.964
- Anything at all?
- Oh, maybe later.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.056
(door closes)

28:46.058 --> 28:47.934
(chatter)

29:31.019 --> 29:33.312
- How's he doing?
- The Major's no novice.

29:33.397 --> 29:38.443
- But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.
- You'll have a job beating that.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.822
I feel lucky. Shall we double?

29:44.032 --> 29:46.117
Of course!

29:46.201 --> 29:48.953
20,000 rupees!

29:53.167 --> 29:56.544
- Always a double six when you need it!
- Always.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.880
- How do you do it!
- It's all in the wrist.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.884
- Oh, it's hopeless.
- Shall we have another game, Major?

30:03.010 --> 30:05.553
- Same stake?
- Yes, I'll have another go.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.014
Your luck's got to run out some time.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.648
May I join you?

30:17.733 --> 30:20.693
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?

30:21.403 --> 30:25.156
- The man at the auction.
- Precisely.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.533
You have a good memory for faces.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.994
And figures.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.665
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No.

30:34.750 --> 30:38.252
- What will you have?
- Nothing, thank you.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.421
Some other time, perhaps?

30:41.924 --> 30:44.008
Thank you.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.765
Six and one!

30:50.891 --> 30:53.518
- Well?
- Looks like the Major has got him.

30:57.022 --> 31:03.236
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?
Double to 100,000 rupees.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.783
I can't accept. Not with your luck.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.370
You win!

31:12.454 --> 31:15.540
(Bond) I would have
taken that double, myself.

31:16.708 --> 31:21.379
Then why don't you take over
the Major's position? Mr...?

31:21.463 --> 31:23.297
Bond.

31:23.465 --> 31:26.634
James Bond. Thank you, I'd be delighted.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.512
100,000 rupees, then.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.976
(Kamal) Double six.

31:35.102 --> 31:38.145
(Kamal) Not such a good double
to accept, after all, was it?

31:47.990 --> 31:50.908
- Double.
- Of course!

31:50.993 --> 31:53.077
You can only win with a double six.

31:53.745 --> 31:59.000
The stake is 200,000 rupees.
Do you have the cash?

32:02.713 --> 32:06.966
Well, I think that this
should be ample security.

32:07.301 --> 32:09.844
- (gasps from spectators)
- Don't you?

32:17.269 --> 32:19.353
Play, Mr Bond.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.357
You need a great deal of luck
to get out of this.

32:24.026 --> 32:25.860
Oh, luck?

32:25.986 --> 32:29.864
Well, then I shall use player's privilege,

32:29.990 --> 32:32.533
and use your lucky dice.

32:34.036 --> 32:36.162
It's all in the wrist.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.539
(dice fall)

32:38.665 --> 32:41.000
Double sixes.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.336
Fancy that!

32:43.420 --> 32:45.504
200,000 rupees.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.682
I prefer cash.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.064
- Get it cashed for him.
- Yes, sir.

33:06.485 --> 33:10.571
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.574
I intend to, Kamal Khan.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.536
My security.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.956
And yours?

33:24.336 --> 33:26.420
(cracking)

33:39.434 --> 33:41.936
It's not really in the wrist, you know.

33:48.735 --> 33:53.447
- Should I be following them?
- Yes, but I think they'll be following this.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.199
Thank you.

33:55.283 --> 33:59.954
Vijay will take you from here.
I'll see if I can find out more about Kamal.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.123
Good. Hold on to these, will you?

34:03.667 --> 34:06.544
Keep you in curry
for a few weeks, won't it?

34:06.795 --> 34:08.713
Thank you.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.505
It's a wonderful racket, this.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.659
(honking)

34:42.789 --> 34:46.292
- Vijay, we have company!
- No problem. This is a company car.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.755
(screaming)

34:55.510 --> 34:56.677
(talking in Hindi)

34:59.556 --> 35:01.682
(Bond) Step on it!

35:02.601 --> 35:04.685
This should shake 'em off!

35:41.556 --> 35:43.641
Oh. Thank God for hard currency!

35:54.069 --> 35:56.695
Game, set and match! Hang on, James!

36:14.589 --> 36:16.423
(horn)

36:18.927 --> 36:20.386
Keep your head down!

36:30.313 --> 36:32.439
Thank you.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.461
Ow! Ooh, ooh, ooh!

37:09.394 --> 37:11.270
(IN HINDI)

37:16.359 --> 37:18.277
Here! Catch!

37:21.781 --> 37:23.824
Excuse me.

37:35.211 --> 37:39.006
Thank you.
You'd better stick this back yourself.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.347
James, over here! Come on!

38:01.029 --> 38:03.155
Vijay! The money I gave you!

38:06.701 --> 38:09.203
Here! Rupees!

38:11.748 --> 38:13.874
Easy come, easy go!

38:35.105 --> 38:37.523
(gives orders in Hindi)

38:37.607 --> 38:40.734
Hm. It certainly pays to advertise.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.903
This way, James.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.875
Ah, Q!

38:57.711 --> 39:00.921
- How are you?
- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.966
How can I be expected
to maintain the quality of my work?

39:04.092 --> 39:07.011
Sent out here at a moment's notice!

39:07.095 --> 39:11.348
Have you any smaller thread?
Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.934
Ah, they missed you? What a pity!

39:14.060 --> 39:16.645
Karen, see to that, will you?

39:16.771 --> 39:20.065
I've also mislaid my PPK.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.067
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.411
Blast!

39:33.246 --> 39:35.414
Having problems keeping it up, Q?

39:35.498 --> 39:37.624
Experimental model.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.756
- Hello, Smithers.
- Commander.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.223
- Smashing, Q.
- Come on. I have a few things for you.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.684
(Bond) Very nice, Smithers.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.021
Is the homing device ready yet?

39:59.105 --> 40:04.610
Not only a homing device, but an
extremely delicate microphone as well.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.362
It goes in there like that.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.948
Now, take a fountain pen.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.701
Twist the top,

40:13.620 --> 40:17.706
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid.

40:18.124 --> 40:22.377
- Dissolves all metals.
- Wonderful for poison-pen letters!

40:22.462 --> 40:24.546
Pay attention, 007!

40:25.090 --> 40:27.174
Pull the top off the pen.

40:27.258 --> 40:31.303
With this ultrasensitive earpiece,
you can listen in on the bug.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.430
The homing device is compatible with

40:33.515 --> 40:37.309
the standard-issue
radio directional finder in your watch.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.270
If you haven't lost it.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.400
(beeping)

40:45.902 --> 40:48.403
That's amazing, Q. It does work.

40:49.322 --> 40:50.948
What's that?

40:51.032 --> 40:54.368
Oh, that's the latest liquid crystal TV.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.456
Hm, very handy!

41:12.971 --> 41:15.055
Mm. Perfect image, Q.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.684
Really, 007!

41:18.852 --> 41:22.604
Look, I haven't time
for these adolescent antics.

41:23.189 --> 41:26.400
- It's the best we can do.
- It's beautiful. Thank you.

41:26.484 --> 41:29.987
Go on, get along! I've got my work to do.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.239
- I'll give you a hand, Q.
- Thank you.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.991
Don't forget this.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.952
Don't let him teach you
any of his bad habits!

41:52.635 --> 41:54.720
Mr Bond, your table is ready.

41:55.722 --> 41:59.099
- I didn't reserve one.
- Your guest is waiting, sir.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.059
This way, please.

42:04.647 --> 42:06.732
Thank you.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.277
You changed your mind.

42:10.904 --> 42:13.405
- I'm glad.
- Are you?

42:13.489 --> 42:15.866
Well, let's put it this way.

42:15.950 --> 42:20.162
You are the least lethal and
by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends

42:20.288 --> 42:22.080
that I've come across.

42:22.165 --> 42:24.041
Thank you.

42:24.125 --> 42:27.794
So does he have a proposition for me,
or do you?

42:29.797 --> 42:32.007
He suggests a trade.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.469
The egg for your life.

42:36.346 --> 42:40.766
I'd heard the price of eggs was going up,
but isn't that a little high?

42:41.601 --> 42:44.102
Charge it to, er... Room...

42:44.979 --> 42:48.106
Oh, 27.
Along with the champagne, I suppose?

42:48.191 --> 42:50.275
I'll leave it at the desk.

42:51.444 --> 42:53.403
You don't mind?

42:53.488 --> 42:56.782
Why? Has Kamal forgotten
what I look like already?

42:57.283 --> 42:58.742
It's for me.

43:00.453 --> 43:02.829
So that if I depart this world suddenly

43:02.914 --> 43:05.290
you'll have something
to remember me by?

43:07.001 --> 43:08.710
Something like that.

43:09.170 --> 43:14.633
It's for my scrapbook.
I collect memories.

43:17.387 --> 43:20.764
Well, let's get on with making a few.

43:47.667 --> 43:50.502
- I need refilling.
- Hm?

43:51.296 --> 43:53.588
Of course you do!

43:58.386 --> 44:00.679
Oh. I'll get some more.

44:00.763 --> 44:04.391
Don't bother.
We'll make yours a loving cup.

44:05.727 --> 44:08.020
What a good idea.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.610
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?

44:17.697 --> 44:20.198
That's my little octopussy.

45:21.094 --> 45:22.969
Good morning!

45:23.054 --> 45:25.013
Morning.

45:25.098 --> 45:28.683
I didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,

45:28.768 --> 45:30.894
I can say a proper goodbye.

45:36.818 --> 45:38.902
What is the time?

45:41.906 --> 45:43.156
(beeps)

45:46.994 --> 45:49.079
Beautiful view, isn't it?

45:53.751 --> 45:57.921
- I don't know how to say goodbye.
- Actions speak louder than words.

45:58.005 --> 45:59.464
You're so right.

46:32.331 --> 46:36.668
(man) In! Out! In! Out!

46:37.378 --> 46:39.963
In! Out!

46:40.047 --> 46:42.132
Come on, girls! In!

46:42.216 --> 46:44.092
Out!

46:48.806 --> 46:50.891
Check oars!

47:16.918 --> 47:19.002
(birdsong)

48:04.674 --> 48:06.967
The egg has been recovered.

48:09.303 --> 48:10.762
You should be pleased.

48:10.846 --> 48:14.599
(woman) I'm not pleased
it was stolen in the first place.

48:14.725 --> 48:17.602
Nor that the thief
knows enough to bring it here.

48:17.687 --> 48:22.148
He's obviously an adventurer
with possible blackmail on his mind.

48:22.233 --> 48:26.194
Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon Palace.

48:26.279 --> 48:29.406
And he will tell us
all he knows very quickly.

48:30.950 --> 48:33.577
- Who is he?
- Englishman.

48:33.661 --> 48:37.414
Likes eggs. Preferably Fabergé.

48:37.498 --> 48:40.292
And dice. Preferably loaded.

48:40.376 --> 48:42.669
His name is James Bond.

48:44.505 --> 48:46.381
Bring him here.

48:46.465 --> 48:50.885
(Kamal) He's dangerous. After he's talked,
we must get rid of him immediately.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.514
No.

48:55.975 --> 48:59.436
A "no" from you
has little chance of becoming a "yes".

48:59.520 --> 49:02.564
I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.066
But you're making a serious mistake.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.585
(beeping)

49:45.650 --> 49:47.734
(beeping quickens)

50:21.894 --> 50:23.978
(knock at door)

50:29.694 --> 50:33.196
Well, so far I can't complain
about the valet service.

50:33.781 --> 50:36.282
Dinner. 8 o'clock.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.204
(locking)

51:06.522 --> 51:09.566
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Good evening.

51:09.650 --> 51:11.526
Well rested?

51:11.610 --> 51:14.904
I believe you and Miss Magda have met.

51:17.616 --> 51:21.411
- It was a pleasure.
- You're too kind.

51:21.704 --> 51:26.207
You don't mind if we start?
The soufflé can't wait.

51:30.504 --> 51:34.340
At the risk of appearing
to be making light dinner conversation,

51:34.425 --> 51:37.093
may I ask exactly why I am here?

51:37.178 --> 51:40.221
I mean, after all, you do have the egg.

51:40.514 --> 51:43.767
True. But we don't have all the answers.

51:45.060 --> 51:49.439
Well, supposing, for argument's sake,
I don't feel like talking?

51:49.523 --> 51:51.941
Don't worry, you will.

51:52.026 --> 51:53.067
You will.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.446
Let me guess.

51:56.530 --> 51:59.032
Thumbscrews and hot coals.

51:59.492 --> 52:03.036
Hardly! We're much more
sophisticated than that.

52:05.372 --> 52:10.460
- Er... Sodium Pentothal?
- A bit crude. Very unreliable.

52:10.544 --> 52:15.715
We prefer curare with
an effective psychedelic compound.

52:15.841 --> 52:17.717
Guaranteed results.

52:18.219 --> 52:22.639
- But with permanent brain damage.
- An unfortunate side effect.

52:23.557 --> 52:26.351
Ah! One of our specialities.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.564
Stuffed sheep's head.

52:37.530 --> 52:39.489
It's odd,

52:39.573 --> 52:43.034
but when I'm stared at
I seem to lose my appetite.

52:59.260 --> 53:01.386
Oh, thank you for dinner.

53:02.930 --> 53:05.014
Until tomorrow, then.

53:11.355 --> 53:15.733
- Well, I'll say good night.
- I could come in for a nightcap.

53:17.736 --> 53:19.779
Some other time, perhaps.

53:26.537 --> 53:29.330
I don't suppose you'd care for a nightcap?

53:29.415 --> 53:31.291
No.

54:19.173 --> 54:21.299
(birds screech)

54:52.873 --> 54:54.999
(whirr of helicopter)

55:34.915 --> 55:36.207
(INAUDIBLE)

55:50.931 --> 55:53.057
(snoring)

55:54.935 --> 55:57.603
(Kamal) I trust you had a pleasant flight.

56:00.232 --> 56:04.277
If you step this way,
I think you will find everything is in order.

56:23.797 --> 56:25.923
(watch beeping)

56:39.271 --> 56:43.733
I congratulate you on the quality of
your workmanship, Prince Kamal Khan.

56:43.817 --> 56:45.485
Thank you, General Orlov.

56:45.569 --> 56:49.822
As you can see, each piece
has been meticulously duplicated

56:49.948 --> 56:53.284
according to Lenkin's specifications.

56:53.994 --> 56:56.954
Good! Have it put aboard the helicopter.

56:58.332 --> 57:01.000
(gives order in Hindi)

57:02.419 --> 57:06.589
(Orlov) Can they be trusted?
(Kamal) I assure you of their silence.

57:11.512 --> 57:14.180
(Kamal) We are both playing
for enormous stakes.

57:14.306 --> 57:19.936
I get what I want,
then you get the genuine jewellery.

57:20.270 --> 57:22.146
- Exactly...
- (interference)

57:43.377 --> 57:46.295
The precise timing will be essential.

57:46.380 --> 57:47.964
(interference)

57:48.048 --> 57:50.550
Remember: Nothing must be changed.

57:50.676 --> 57:52.718
(interference)

57:54.763 --> 57:59.725
(Orlov) One week from today,
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

58:00.602 --> 58:03.062
- Karl-Marx-Stadt!
- Correct!

58:03.147 --> 58:05.648
(footsteps)

58:06.650 --> 58:08.734
(talking in Hindi)

58:11.238 --> 58:13.364
(door shuts)

58:21.540 --> 58:25.501
- Everything taken care of?
- As you ordered, Excellence.

58:27.504 --> 58:31.340
- So, you recovered it?
- From an accomplice of the thief.

58:31.425 --> 58:34.677
He must be eliminated at once!

58:34.761 --> 58:36.095
(crackling)

58:36.180 --> 58:39.348
There must be no further security breach.

58:39.433 --> 58:42.768
This fake has caused enough trouble.

58:47.107 --> 58:49.025
I must go.

58:59.119 --> 59:01.871
(Orlov) Everything
has been most satisfactory.

59:01.955 --> 59:04.123
(Kamal) Most kind, General Orlov.

59:49.294 --> 59:51.379
Get Bond!

59:59.805 --> 01:00:01.889
(shouting in Hindi)

01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:11.148
The Englishman has escaped.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:15.278
He won't go very far. We'll track him.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:30.084
(shouting and whistling)

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:32.253
(elephant trumpets)

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.645
Ooh!

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:29.435
Oooh! Ya-ha!

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.229
(petrified screams)

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:43.074
Good!

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:45.576
Let the sport commence.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:06.722
Ooh! Agh! Yieeehhh!

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.232
(growling)

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:22.279
(gives orders in Hindi)

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.994
Head him off! Head him off!

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:31.580
(shouting in Hindi)

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:38.546
(roars)

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.384
Sit!

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.686
We have him! We have him!

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.939
Go round! Go round! He's in there!

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:34.351
Hiss off.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:47.823
(birds squawking)

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:02.463
(shouts in Hindi)

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:31.075
(Tarzan-like jungle call)

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:35.871
(gunfire)

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:41.293
Ow!

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:47.633
Ugh!

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.891
(elephant trumpets)

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:01.188
Don't let him get away!

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.608
(gunfire)

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.614
(shouts in Hindi)

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:23.210
Hey!

01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:41.687
- C'mom, buddy, c'mon!
- Give him some room.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.064
- Hey, you all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.

01:05:44.149 --> 01:05:48.527
- Are you with our group?
- No, ma'am. I'm with the economy tour.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:56.493
Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:59.204
Soon to be made extinct!

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:11.216
Genus Hapalochlaena. Produces a venom
that's invariably fatal in seconds.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.177
The barge had that sign.

01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:17.973
Yes. It belongs to a fabulously wealthy
woman who lives on the floating palace.

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:19.516
Who is she?

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:23.270
No one knows her real name,
but she's known as Octopussy.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:26.607
That's the name I heard at Kamal's.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:30.653
I hear that island's full of
beautiful women. No men allowed.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:34.281
Really? Sexual discrimination.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.409
I'll definitely have to pay it a visit.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.851
(sitar music and women laughing)

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.798
(gong)

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:10.210
Good evening.

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:13.797
I wondered when you might arrive.

01:08:13.882 --> 01:08:16.300
So you are the mysterious Octopussy.

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:18.801
And you are James Bond.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.970
007, licensed to kill.

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.640
Am I to be your target for tonight?

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:27.102
Not necessarily.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:32.691
Depends how much you tell me
about jewellery smuggling.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:35.778
And why one of our agents
was killed in East Berlin.

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.946
I know nothing about that.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:41.617
You remember Major Dexter Smythe?

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:44.870
You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.581
You seem to have done your homework.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:53.212
Thank you. Yes. Smythe, after a brilliant
military career, joined our secret service.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:58.258
His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.

01:08:58.343 --> 01:09:01.220
Both he and his native guide disappeared.

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.388
The gold was never found.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.684
And 20 years later
you were sent after him.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:15.274
The guide's body turned up with a bullet
still in his skull from Smythe's revolver.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.861
I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:22.115
and gave him 24 hours to clear up
his affairs before I took him back.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.453
He committed suicide rather than
face the disgrace of a court martial.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.831
What's the connection?

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:36.129
He was my father. I'd hoped
fate would bring us together one day.

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:37.881
To avenge him?

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:40.884
No. To thank you
for giving him an alternative.

01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:43.053
(knock at door)

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:49.309
Come in.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.145
Kamal Khan to see you.

01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:58.318
Bond has escaped.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:01.530
- How careless of you!
- I apologise.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:05.409
By the way, I'd like you
to meet my new house guest.

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:09.746
Er, an old friend of the family,
you might say.

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:11.748
How lovely.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:15.419
You have a nasty habit of surviving.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:18.088
You know what they say about the fittest.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:24.595
Octopussy, I would enjoy another
opportunity to take care of Mr Bond

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:28.432
- personally.
- I will take care of Mr Bond myself.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:32.477
Good night.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.607
And enjoy yourselves.

01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:39.401
Mr Bond.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.870
My father became
a leading authority on octopi.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:53.498
He loved them.
His pet name for me was Octopussy.

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:02.007
Mr Bond, smuggling is no concern
of the secret service.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.509
I've violated no British law.

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:09.681
You are free to leave, but I'd much prefer
if you stayed as my guest for a few days.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:12.184
I'd like that.

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:16.772
Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:20.692
Good night, Mr Bond.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.612
Till the morning, then.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:30.410
Midge.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:35.707
Extend Mr Bond every courtesy,
but double the guard on his quarters.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:50.305
(speaks Hindi)

01:11:58.106 --> 01:12:00.607
He says the island is heavily guarded.

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:06.863
We don't want to
make enemies with the woman.

01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:16.790
(Hindi)

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.972
The woman must not be harmed.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:58.040
When Father's gold ran out, the people in
Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:01.418
offered me a commission
to smuggle some diamonds.

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:03.670
I discovered I had a talent for it.

01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:05.881
So you went into business yourself?

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:10.385
Yes, but I needed an organisation,
so I revived the old Octopus cult.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:14.431
Well, then.
Where did you recruit all these lovelies?

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.977
There are many of them
all over Southeast Asia,

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:22.647
looking for a guru,
spiritual discipline, who knows what.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:28.070
I train them. Give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of life.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.822
- In crime?
- In business.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:35.327
I have diversified into
shipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:43.418
- Is he still there?
- You must be joking!

01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:47.047
007 on an island
populated exclusively by women?

01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:49.800
We won't see him till dawn.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:54.846
- I'll relieve you at midnight.
- No problem!

01:14:10.822 --> 01:14:11.822
(door opens)

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.994
Are we going somewhere?

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:21.039
I have to go to Europe tomorrow
on a business trip.

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:25.502
Oh, that's a pity.
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.

01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:28.713
I think you should stay.
I'll only be gone a week.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:32.217
When I come back
we'll discuss the future.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:36.721
Well, I can't guarantee
that I'll be here when you return.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:40.308
Oh, James! We're two of a kind.

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:45.355
There are vast rewards for a man
of your talents willing to take risks.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:50.777
- I'm not for hire.
- Oh! A man of principle!

01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:52.863
With a price on his head.

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:56.074
Naturally,
you do it for Queen and country!

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:00.996
I have no country,
I have no price on my head.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.125
I don't have to apologise to you,
a paid assassin, for what I am!

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:23.685
No!

01:15:24.187 --> 01:15:26.229
You're right.

01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:28.398
We are two of a kind.

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:39.868
Oh, James!

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.817
(creaking)

01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:25.121
Q?

01:16:47.895 --> 01:17:28.059
(birds screech)

01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:54.210
Is something wrong?

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:57.380
Not really.

01:17:57.465 --> 01:17:59.549
Just a feeling.

01:17:59.759 --> 01:18:01.843
Won't you come back to bed?

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:25.033
Move!

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.788
Hai-ya!

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.972
- James!
- Ooh!

01:18:57.983 --> 01:18:59.776
Watch it!

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.739
Argh!

01:19:04.824 --> 01:19:06.491
Come on!

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.642
Careful!

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.356
Give me the gun!

01:19:45.865 --> 01:19:47.740
Ooh!

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:03.256
(screaming)

01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:45.590
What happened to Vijay?

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.387
He was alive when I found him.

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:56.226
- Did he say anything?
- All he said was "It was Kamal's men."

01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:02.273
No more problems.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:09.989
- Better signal M to meet me in Berlin.
- Why?

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:13.618
Well, I have to go to a circus
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:26.631
We verified the Octopussy Circus
was in East Berlin when we lost 009.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.510
Karl-Marx-Stadt is further east.

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:36.140
Why would General Orlov
participate in a jewellery caper?

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:40.186
Well, the jewellery, sir,
I think is, if you'll forgive the analogy,

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:42.814
only the tip of the tentacle.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.942
Here's the ID you'll need.

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:50.196
Charles Moreton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds.

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:53.658
Visiting furniture factories
in East Germany.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:57.203
- Karl will take you in.
- No problem.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.964
Remember, 007, you're on your own.

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:10.883
Thank you, sir. That's a great comfort.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.527
(laughter and applause)

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.449
Meine Damen und Herren,

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:38.578
ich hab' das Vergnügen,
euch vorzustellen die Zwillinge...

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:43.374
Mischka und Grischka,
mit ihrer Messerwurfsensation!

01:22:56.764 --> 01:22:58.598
(drum roll)

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:17.784
(Grischka counts in Russian
as audience gasps)

01:23:28.796 --> 01:23:30.755
(fanfare and applause)

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:44.519
(drum roll)

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.609
Mischka!

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:55.029
(wild applause)

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.285
(marching tune)

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:18.469
Meine Damen und Herren,
die menschliche Kanonenkugel...

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:21.139
...Francisco der Furchtlose!

01:24:23.142 --> 01:24:25.226
(fanfare)

01:24:28.272 --> 01:24:30.314
(shouts in Russian)

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:44.787
(drum roll)

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:51.002
(screaming)

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:54.839
(fanfare)

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:04.015
(band playing marching tune)

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:43.387
...fährt in wenigen Minuten ab.

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:48.684
Achtung, einsteigen. Türen schließen.
Vorsicht bei der Abfahrt.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:14.168
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.421
He just arrived from Leningrad.

01:26:17.548 --> 01:26:19.590
Hm, the Romanov Star.

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:32.937
The Romanov Star.

01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:49.287
Der Sonderzug des Zirkus Octopussy
auf Gleis 2 fährt in wenigen Minuten ab.

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.247
Achtung einsteigen...

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:11.225
Stay here with the jewellery while
they switch the car to the main track.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.644
You stay, also.

01:28:34.226 --> 01:28:36.143
100 kiloton yield.

01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:40.231
The effects are indistinguishable
from the American medium-yield bomb.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:48.656
The detonator. Now listen carefully.
It is pre-set for a four-hour delay.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.825
Set time for the explosion here.

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:57.415
To activate, insert,

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:02.920
and twist the lever
a quarter-turn clockwise.

01:29:03.046 --> 01:29:07.008
Be at least 20 miles away
when it goes off, hm?

01:30:09.488 --> 01:30:12.490
The jewellery should net us
300 million in Zürich.

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:14.784
We still have to cross the border.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.667
I must go.

01:30:23.794 --> 01:30:25.836
Au revoir, dear lady.

01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:28.339
Good luck.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.479
Ow!

01:31:25.564 --> 01:31:27.690
(train horn)

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:12.776
Bring the canister!

01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:25.456
Put it in the car.

01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:34.882
Leave that. Let's go.

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:38.928
Let's stay. Sit on that box.
Hands on your knees. Come on, move!

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:41.805
Why is that bomb on the train?

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:47.102
- Who are you?
- I'm British secret service.

01:32:50.982 --> 01:32:55.152
You should be more concerned
about getting out of here alive.

01:32:55.528 --> 01:33:00.157
I am more concerned about an atomic
bomb exploding on a US Air Force base.

01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:04.620
You can't be inviting a nuclear war!
What happens when the US retaliates?

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:07.164
Against whom?

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:11.585
My God. Of course.

01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:16.173
Our early-warning system will rule out
the bomb having come from Russia

01:33:16.258 --> 01:33:18.342
or anywhere else.

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:23.347
Everyone will assume incorrectly that
it was a US bomb triggered accidentally.

01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:27.935
That would be
the most plausible explanation.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:30.980
Europe will insist on disarmament,

01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:34.775
leaving every border undefended
for you to walk across at will.

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:36.944
It doesn't matter a damn to you

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:40.698
that thousands of innocent people
will die in your accident!

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:44.034
Better than letting
a handful of old men in Moscow

01:33:44.119 --> 01:33:48.289
bargain away our advantage
in disarmament talks!

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:51.375
On your feet, General!
You're going to stop that train.

01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:53.669
(train whistle)

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:58.340
- It's too late.
- You can stop it at the border.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:08.058
(Orlov) Kill him! Kill him!

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:24.658
(train whistle)

01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:34.418
Kill him! Kill him!

01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:42.259
(men shouting)

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:46.096
Get to the station!

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:57.024
Stop that car!

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.474
Stop!

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:34.812
Follow that car!

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:28.782
(whistle screaming)

01:36:39.878 --> 01:36:41.962
Ach du lieber Gott!

01:37:20.251 --> 01:37:24.338
Kamal Khan says we are to stay here
until we cross the border.

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:35.849
The licence plate is General Orlov's.

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:39.102
We have discovered this.

01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:46.026
- Where is General Orlov now?
- Last reported heading for the border.

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:57.454
Guten Tag.

01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:36.827
(guard's whistle)

01:39:14.198 --> 01:39:16.325
I must get to that train!

01:39:17.285 --> 01:39:19.786
Halt! Stehen bleiben!

01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:24.958
Stop!

01:39:38.681 --> 01:39:40.724
A common thief!

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:43.226
A disgrace to the uniform.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.980
Yes. But tomorrow,

01:39:48.066 --> 01:39:50.400
I shall be a hero

01:39:50.485 --> 01:39:53.862
of the Soviet Union.

01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:02.371
(train whistle)

01:40:23.893 --> 01:40:26.269
It is now 11.45.

01:40:26.354 --> 01:40:30.232
The performance begins at 3.
Allowing for delays,

01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:33.360
set the bomb to detonate at 3.45.

01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:53.630
We must leave the base by 3.15.

01:40:54.716 --> 01:40:57.634
I take it none of you will be late.

01:41:12.108 --> 01:41:13.984
(clatter)

01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:31.960
Hai-ya!

01:42:35.525 --> 01:42:37.400
Argh!

01:43:13.062 --> 01:43:14.271
The jewellery!

01:43:14.397 --> 01:43:16.857
- Did you recognise him?
- No.

01:43:16.941 --> 01:43:19.025
Stay here with her.

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:30.036
Ooh! Argh!

01:43:35.793 --> 01:43:37.460
Ahhhh!

01:43:44.468 --> 01:43:46.636
Argh!

01:44:06.824 --> 01:44:08.325
On the roof. Trouble!

01:44:34.018 --> 01:44:35.518
Mischka!

01:44:47.365 --> 01:44:49.282
(both scream)

01:45:02.338 --> 01:45:04.214
Ooh!

01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:13.473
And this

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:16.393
for my brother.

01:45:19.188 --> 01:45:21.064
Argh!

01:45:22.233 --> 01:45:24.317
And that's for 009.

01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:28.571
(cheering and whistling)

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:01.771
(car approaching)

01:46:06.777 --> 01:46:08.903
(honks horn)

01:46:14.285 --> 01:46:16.369
(military march)

01:46:42.313 --> 01:46:44.439
Kommen Sie hier! Kommen Sie hier!

01:46:45.483 --> 01:46:47.567
(derisory laughter)

01:47:05.086 --> 01:47:07.587
Gobinda will stay with the jewellery.

01:47:22.103 --> 01:47:24.187
- Wurst, Bubi?
- Danke, Liebchen.

01:47:24.313 --> 01:47:25.855
- Schneller!
- Ja, ja.

01:47:25.981 --> 01:47:28.858
- Wurst?
- Wir machen schon. Ist gut!

01:47:28.984 --> 01:47:31.694
- Ein Bier?
- Danke schön, sehr freundlich.

01:47:32.363 --> 01:47:35.031
(driver) Ja, ja, wir fahren...

01:47:51.507 --> 01:47:54.008
(woman chattering) Ja, ja, ja!

01:47:57.888 --> 01:47:59.556
- Essen?
- Nichts, danke!

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.808
Nehmen Sie ein wenig Wurst.

01:48:01.892 --> 01:48:06.563
- Diese Engländer sind ganz verrückt!
- Bitte, Fräulein! Ist sehr wichtig...

01:48:06.856 --> 01:48:10.567
(band plays circus music)

01:48:22.413 --> 01:48:23.621
(INAUDIBLE)

01:48:27.877 --> 01:48:33.089
- (door shuts, engine starts)
- Was machen Sie... Das ist mein Auto!

01:48:33.591 --> 01:48:35.717
He, mein Auto!

01:48:39.597 --> 01:48:41.055
(siren)

01:48:52.776 --> 01:48:57.280
General, excuse me. I have some travel
arrangements to make. Enjoy the show.

01:48:57.364 --> 01:49:00.366
- Thank you.
- I'm sure he'll get a big blast out of this!

01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:02.952
I know he won't be disappointed.

01:49:22.389 --> 01:49:24.474
(crowd cheering)

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.564
(car fails to start)

01:49:33.442 --> 01:49:35.485
(car starts)

01:49:37.655 --> 01:49:39.739
(honking)

01:50:28.497 --> 01:50:30.790
- That was Bond.
- Good! Let him keep going.

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:33.209
He'll be late and we'll be rid of him too!

01:50:37.881 --> 01:50:39.340
Great, isn't it?

01:50:40.301 --> 01:50:42.385
(drum roll)

01:50:46.515 --> 01:50:48.558
Fantastic! Fantastic!

01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:54.897
Marvellous!

01:50:55.024 --> 01:50:58.818
General, how long would I get
in the brig if I stole your wallet?

01:50:58.902 --> 01:51:01.404
- Er, about two years.
- That long?

01:51:01.488 --> 01:51:04.407
Well, in that case, I'd better return it!

01:51:04.533 --> 01:51:06.117
Son of a gun!

01:51:16.086 --> 01:51:19.505
- Where's the Base Commander?
- Let's see your circus pass.

01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:22.842
- Damn it, man, it's urgent!
- (sirens)

01:51:22.926 --> 01:51:24.761
Get out, put your hands up!

01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:31.267
Gestohlenes Auto!

01:51:33.228 --> 01:51:37.273
Captain, some nut went through in
a stolen car. Wants the Base Commander.

01:51:37.399 --> 01:51:39.067
He's wearing a red shirt.

01:51:41.904 --> 01:51:43.863
There he is! There he is!

01:51:46.867 --> 01:51:48.951
Go after that guy in the red shirt.

01:51:49.078 --> 01:51:51.245
He's ducked behind the trailers.

01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:15.311
Keep searching, you guys.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

01:52:18.315 --> 01:52:20.483
Look under the trailer, you guys.

01:52:51.432 --> 01:52:55.518
- (compère) Ladies and gentlemen...
- Hey! Is anyone else in there?

01:52:55.644 --> 01:53:02.859
And now for the first time in this country,
the death-defying human cannonball!

01:53:03.193 --> 01:53:07.780
I have the pleasure in presenting to you
Francisco the Fearless!

01:53:15.164 --> 01:53:17.707
The suspect's wearing a clown suit. Over.

01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:28.050
That's him!

01:53:32.055 --> 01:53:34.390
Hold it, buddy! You're coming with us.

01:53:50.574 --> 01:53:54.994
- General, there's a bomb in that cannon.
- Sure! Where else would a bomb be?

01:53:55.078 --> 01:53:59.248
- Great clown!
- I'm deadly serious! I'm a British agent!

01:53:59.374 --> 01:54:02.335
- What?
- For God's sake, tell him who I am!

01:54:02.419 --> 01:54:07.215
Kamal and Orlov double-crossed you.
I saw them take the jewellery off the train!

01:54:08.425 --> 01:54:10.760
Does that convince you?

01:54:10.886 --> 01:54:15.264
Sir, that bomb is set to explode at 3.45.
That's 90 seconds from now!

01:54:15.349 --> 01:54:18.017
General, this man's either drunk or crazy.

01:54:25.567 --> 01:54:27.693
He'll destroy the entire operation.

01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:49.131
You two, grab that man!
Grab him! Hold him!

01:54:50.133 --> 01:54:52.468
(Bond) Damn it! Let go!

01:54:52.636 --> 01:54:54.720
Let me go, there's a bomb in there!

01:54:54.805 --> 01:54:56.889
(gasping)

01:55:00.561 --> 01:55:02.645
(screaming)

01:55:07.401 --> 01:55:09.485
Let him go!

01:55:10.654 --> 01:55:12.488
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

01:55:23.458 --> 01:55:25.501
(gasp from crowd)

01:55:28.839 --> 01:55:31.173
- Now?
- (riotous laughter)

01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:33.593
Thank you. You did a great job.

01:55:34.261 --> 01:55:36.429
Where was Kamal going?

01:55:36.513 --> 01:55:38.848
Back to India.

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:48.024
(General) Folks, we've had an emergency,
but everything is all right now.

01:55:48.108 --> 01:55:50.526
You and your families are safe.

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:56.365
Now, please leave the tent
in an orderly manner. Thank you.

01:55:59.995 --> 01:56:03.372
- The plane is refuelled.
- We'll take off at sunrise.

01:56:03.457 --> 01:56:06.667
- Are the gold certificates on board?
- Yes, Excellence.

01:56:08.295 --> 01:56:12.298
We'll take these also.
Dollars, pounds, francs, marks.

01:56:12.382 --> 01:56:14.467
I can always print my own.

01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:16.677
(music and laughter)

01:56:17.721 --> 01:56:21.641
- What is that?
- Girls selling themselves.

01:56:21.725 --> 01:56:25.061
Good. It will keep the men occupied.

01:56:25.187 --> 01:56:27.313
I don't want them to see me leave.

01:56:36.156 --> 01:56:38.032
Now!

01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:46.666
Argh!

01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:50.086
Give us a hand.

01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:29.625
Come on! Shh!

01:57:52.816 --> 01:57:54.942
Let's go. All set?

01:58:05.579 --> 01:58:07.663
Lift!

01:58:12.836 --> 01:58:14.962
That's it. Steady.

01:58:24.514 --> 01:58:28.350
- Make sure the horses are saddled.
- Yes, Excellence.

01:58:28.477 --> 01:58:30.519
I'll join you in a few minutes.

01:58:44.451 --> 01:58:48.621
- Do you really think you can escape me?
- Orlov betrayed us.

01:58:49.456 --> 01:58:52.291
I swear I knew nothing about the bomb.

01:58:52.375 --> 01:58:58.839
We're partners, we're friends. Octopussy,
I would never do anything to hurt you.

01:59:08.683 --> 01:59:10.851
(gives order in Hindi)

01:59:11.353 --> 01:59:15.564
You left me to be killed
along with thousands of innocent people!

01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:19.401
Octopussy.

01:59:20.654 --> 01:59:23.364
Look! I was bringing you this.

01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:25.658
We can make millions.

01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:27.660
(alarm bell)

01:59:30.205 --> 01:59:32.915
Take her! She's our ticket out of here.

01:59:55.689 --> 01:59:59.692
- I trust you can handle this contraption.
- It goes by hot air.

01:59:59.776 --> 02:00:01.861
Oh, then you can!

02:00:11.121 --> 02:00:14.790
(Q) They're doing fine.
(Bond) But I don't see Octopussy.

02:00:31.641 --> 02:00:34.768
- There she is! She's in trouble!
- Get your hands off me!

02:00:35.145 --> 02:00:37.271
- (Q) I'll take her down.
- No! Up!

02:00:38.315 --> 02:00:43.110
Where are you going?
Look, don't be an idiot, 007. Come back!

02:00:51.995 --> 02:00:53.662
Kill him!

02:01:04.841 --> 02:01:06.508
(Hindi)

02:02:12.909 --> 02:02:14.743
(gasping)

02:02:17.998 --> 02:02:20.082
Come on!

02:02:23.086 --> 02:02:26.255
What are you doing?
Cut it out! We haven't time for that!

02:02:26.381 --> 02:02:28.424
- Ah.
- Later perhaps.

02:02:53.366 --> 02:02:55.451
Come on! Giddap!

02:03:09.716 --> 02:03:12.384
Come on! Come on!

02:03:34.657 --> 02:03:36.784
(rattling)

02:04:39.848 --> 02:04:43.475
He'll kill us all! Go out and get him!

02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:45.644
- Out there?
- Go!

02:04:46.062 --> 02:04:47.729
Yes, Excellence.

02:05:22.515 --> 02:05:24.600
Aaagghh!

02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:10.979
- Jump!
- Ohhhhh!

02:06:13.483 --> 02:06:16.151
Oh, no! Oh, no!

02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:40.008
My government categorically denies
the incident ever occurred.

02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:45.847
However, we request Bond to return
one of our most historic treasures,

02:06:45.932 --> 02:06:47.599
the Romanov Star.

02:06:47.684 --> 02:06:52.187
In the interests of our Anglo-Soviet
relationships, that can be arranged.

02:06:52.272 --> 02:06:55.190
Ah, where is Commander Bond?

02:06:55.275 --> 02:07:00.946
Well, owing to the serious nature of his
injuries, he's still not fit enough to travel.

02:07:01.114 --> 02:07:05.117
In! Out! In! Out!

02:07:19.507 --> 02:07:21.550
- I wish...
- What?

02:07:23.886 --> 02:07:26.847
I wish you weren't
in such a weakened condition.

02:07:28.308 --> 02:07:30.392
Oh, James!

02:07:33.813 --> 02:07:34.855
Mmmm!

02:07:36.858 --> 02:07:38.275
James!

02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:41.570
(All Time High playing)

02:07:47.035 --> 02:07:50.912
All I wanted was a sweet distraction

02:07:50.997 --> 02:07:53.915
For an hour or two

02:07:54.542 --> 02:07:58.545
Had no intention to do

02:07:59.255 --> 02:08:02.507
The things we've done

02:08:05.094 --> 02:08:08.930
Funny how it always goes with love

02:08:09.015 --> 02:08:12.434
When you don't look, you find

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:16.438
But then we're two of a kind

02:08:17.565 --> 02:08:20.859
We move as one

02:08:21.778 --> 02:08:26.281
We're an all time high

02:08:26.366 --> 02:08:30.285
We'll change all that's gone before

02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:34.748
Doing so much more

02:08:35.458 --> 02:08:39.294
Than falling in love

02:08:39.962 --> 02:08:43.882
On an all time high

02:08:44.467 --> 02:08:48.470
We'll take on the world and win

02:08:49.305 --> 02:08:52.140
So hold on tight

02:08:52.266 --> 02:08:54.726
Let the flight

02:08:54.811 --> 02:08:58.772
Begin

02:08:59.899 --> 02:09:03.819
I don't want to waste a waking moment

02:09:03.945 --> 02:09:07.072
I don't want to sleep

02:09:07.156 --> 02:09:11.159
I'm in so strong and so deep

02:09:11.994 --> 02:09:15.497
And so are you

02:09:17.834 --> 02:09:21.586
In my time I've said these words before

02:09:21.671 --> 02:09:24.673
But now I realise

02:09:25.466 --> 02:09:29.261
My heart was telling me lies

02:09:30.012 --> 02:09:33.807
For you they're true

02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:38.437
We're an all time high

02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:42.941
We'll change all that's gone before

02:09:43.484 --> 02:09:47.362
Doing so much more

02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:51.867
Than falling in love

02:09:52.535 --> 02:09:56.455
On an all time high

02:09:57.039 --> 02:10:01.042
We'll take on the world and win

02:10:02.003 --> 02:10:04.963
So hold on tight

02:10:05.047 --> 02:10:07.215
Let the flight

02:10:07.341 --> 02:10:09.843
Begin

02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:14.055
So hold on tight

02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:16.308
Let the flight

02:10:16.392 --> 02:10:18.894
Begin

02:10:19.896 --> 02:10:29.237
We're an all time high

02:10:46.297 --> 02:10:47.297
