Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, honey.

Why don't you leave us alone?
Be nice and leave us alone!

What's your name?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.306
Ponyboy Curtis.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.018
That's an original name.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.772
Yeah, my dad,
he was an original person.

09:23.855 --> 09:27.400
I got a brother named sodapop.
It even says so on his birth certificate.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.698
My name's Sherry, but my friends
call me cherry cos of my hair.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.326

You're a cheerleader.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.702
Yeah.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.455
You don't look old enough
to be going to high school.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.583
What's a nice boy like you doing
hanging around with that trash?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.670
Dally's my buddy. I'm a greaser, too.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.673
We're all friends.
— I'm sorry. I didn't know.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.555
Your brother, sodapop, he works at
the gasoline station, right? At dx.

09:57.639 --> 09:58.973
Yeah, that's him.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.642
Yeah, soda's the cute one!

[Chuckles]

10:05.271 --> 10:08.441
Hey, how come we don't see
your brother at school any more?

10:09.526 --> 10:13.196
Has he been working full—time
since your parents died?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.783
- He's a dropout.
- — oh, that's too bad.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.369
Here.
I thought this might cool you off.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.956
[Horn honks]

10:23.832 --> 10:26.084
Maybe that will
cool you off, greaser!

10:26.167 --> 10:28.479
When you learn to talk and
act decent, I might cool off, too!

10:28.503 --> 10:30.713
Fiery, huh? Just the way I like 'em!

10:30.797 --> 10:33.007
- Get off of me!
- Come on.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.385
- Ow!
- Look, leave her alone, dal.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.514
What did you say?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.599
Come on. You heard me.
Leave her alone.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.187
What did you say, you little shit?
What did you say to me?

10:46.271 --> 10:48.356
- Come on. — you wiseass.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.285
[Man #1] Hey, wise guy,
cool it, will you?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.413
[Man #2] Sit down, punk!

11:08.251 --> 11:09.878
Now you blew it.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.005
Thank you. He had me scared to death.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.216
You sure didn't show it.
Nobody talks to dal like that.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.553
From what I saw, you do.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.931
Why don't y'all come sit here with us
so you can protect us?

11:23.016 --> 11:25.977
What do you think, man? Come on.
— might as well.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.609
How old are y'all?

11:34.569 --> 11:36.196
I thought you were both 14!

11:38.698 --> 11:42.035
How come y'all ain't scared of us
like you was of daily?

11:42.118 --> 11:45.496
Oh, you two are too sweet—looking
to scare anyone.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.249
Besides, I know about Dallas Winston.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.169
You two don't look mean.

11:51.252 --> 11:55.173
Yeah, right.
We're young and innocent.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.176
No. You're just not dirty.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.637
Come on, dal's ok.
I mean, he's tough and all.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.681
But he's a cool old guy,
if you get to know him.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.892
He'd leave you alone
if he knew who you were.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.938
Well, I'm glad he doesn't know us.
— I kind of admire him.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.275
Oi, greaser! You're dead!

12:14.359 --> 12:16.152
What's he doing? Get out of my hair!

12:16.236 --> 12:18.863
Hey, what have you done?

12:18.947 --> 12:21.407
Here, kid, have a beer.
It'll settle your nerves.

12:21.491 --> 12:26.496
Well, now, who we got here?
Your great-grandmothers, huh?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.874
What are you two young ladies doing
hanging out with these greasers?

12:29.958 --> 12:32.001
Dal was bothering them.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.336
He was, huh? — yeah.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.380
Where is old dal now anyway?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.383
Yeah, where is old dally?

12:41.427 --> 12:42.679
He left, Tim.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.849
Hey, I know he slashed my tyres!

12:47.850 --> 12:50.395
Look, Tim, he left.
He's not here. Really.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.147
- You guys seen dally? — no, no.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.860
Yeah, well, I'll be looking for him.

13:01.239 --> 13:04.075
Dally got a blade?
— I don't think so.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.869
Good deal. Tim will fight fair
as long as he don't.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.958
You guys don't believe
in playing rough, do you?

13:12.041 --> 13:15.586
- — Well, a fair fight ain't rough.
- Yeah, boy. Real simple!

13:15.670 --> 13:19.841
Yeah! If he gets killed or something,
you just Bury him. No sweat!

13:19.924 --> 13:21.384
[Chuckles]

13:21.467 --> 13:25.638
- You dig, ok, baby. You want a chew?
- Come on, two—bit.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.807
Help yourself.
Put hair on your chest!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.267
[Chuckles]

13:29.350 --> 13:32.145
Ponyboy, come with me
and get some cokes and popcorn.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.730
Sure.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.273
Y'all want some? — I do.

13:35.356 --> 13:39.277
Yeah, me, too.
Get Johnny some, too. I'm buying.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.820
Here you go.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.326
Your friend, the one
with the sideburns, is he ok?

13:46.409 --> 13:49.120
Yeah, he ain't dangerous like dal,
if that's what you mean.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.333
Hey, what are you doing?
— hey, man!

13:54.042 --> 13:55.835
He sure scared Johnny.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.464
Johnny's a nervous wreck anyway.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.842
He got beat up a few months ago
by some soc.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.679
Is that how he got his scar?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.848
Yeah, the guy
was wearing a few rings.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.895
- — Not all of us are like that.
- Sure.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.398
That's like saying all you greasers
are like Dallas Winston.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.068
- — Leave him, will you?
- What you gonna do about it?

14:20.151 --> 14:22.779
Let's take it outside.
That's what I'll do.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.449
All right, you two.
Why don't you both take it outside?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.951
Well, he's jumped a few people.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.748
Anyway, you think the socs
have it made.

14:33.831 --> 14:37.668
The rich kids. The southside soc.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.296
Well, I'll tell you something,
ponyboy,

14:40.380 --> 14:44.258
and it might come as a surprise,
but things are rough all over.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.513
Come on. Let's get out of here.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.807
Or two—bit will think
we eloped to Mexico!

14:52.517 --> 14:55.645
- So, you're from the southside, huh?
- — yes.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.648
- — It must be a nice neighbourhood.
- It is. I like it.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.358
- Do you? — mm-hm.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.486
Yeah, I'm...
I'm from the other side of town.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.571
[Chuckles] Oh.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.990
[Shouting]

15:14.330 --> 15:16.416
[Horns honk]

15:25.299 --> 15:29.429
Tell me about your oldest brother.
You never seem to talk about him.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.014
What's to tell?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.350
He's big and roofs houses.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.602
No, really. I mean, what's he like?

15:36.686 --> 15:39.272
I feel like I know soda
for as much as you talk about him.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.941
Tell me about darry.
Is he wild and reckless like soda?

15:42.024 --> 15:44.026
Or dreamy like you?

15:46.404 --> 15:49.407
He ain't like soda,
and he sure ain't like me!

15:49.490 --> 15:51.325
He can't stand me!

15:52.618 --> 15:56.497
I bet he wishes he could stick me in
some boys' home. Soda won't let him.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.917
- — What are you talking about, ponyboy?
- Come on. You all get along fine.

16:00.001 --> 16:03.546
No, we don't! You shut your trap,
cos you ain't wanted at home either!

16:03.629 --> 16:05.089
You shut your mouth, kid!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.509
[Ponyboy] I'm sorry.
I got a little mad.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.511
[Johnny] Don't worry about it.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.848
- We couldn't get along without you.
- — marcia!

16:13.931 --> 16:16.851
Look who's coming!
— what are we gonna do?

16:16.934 --> 16:19.770
- Just act normal. Just keep calm.
- Who are these clowns?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.649
Cherry, what's going on?

16:23.733 --> 16:25.443
What are you doing?

16:27.737 --> 16:29.822
- Just because we got a little drunk...
- A little?!

16:29.906 --> 16:33.075
You call reeling and passing out
on the streets "a little"?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.660
Bob, I've told you before,

16:34.744 --> 16:37.580
I'm never going out with you
when you're drinking and I mean it!

16:37.663 --> 16:40.458
That's no reason to go walking
the streets with these bums!

16:40.541 --> 16:42.710
- Who are you calling bums, pal?
- — you!

16:42.793 --> 16:45.630
Randy!
— we got two more in the back seat.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.966
Pity the back seat!
— If you're looking for a fight...

16:49.050 --> 16:52.220
I am looking for a fight!
Let's go! Come on! Right now!

16:52.303 --> 16:53.888
Come on!

16:53.971 --> 16:56.349
All right! We'll go with you!
Just wait a minute!

16:56.432 --> 17:00.478
We ain't scared of these bastards!
— I hate fights! I hate 'em!

17:01.479 --> 17:03.064
[Cherry] Come here, ponyboy.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.402
I'm sorry.

17:08.486 --> 17:11.531
Look, I couldn't use this.
I could never cut no one.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.281
[Bob] Cherry! Come on!

17:13.366 --> 17:15.326
We'd better go with 'em.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.460
If I see you in school and I don't
say hi, don't take it personal, ok?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.295
Yeah, I know.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.923
Really.
You're a nice boy and everything.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.633
It's ok.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.012
[Chuckles]

17:36.430 --> 17:38.641
I hope I never see
Dallas Winston again.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.227
If I do,
I'll probably fall in love with him.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.187
- Come on, baby.
- — don't touch me!

17:54.323 --> 17:58.369
- [Bob] Just watch it, greaseball.
- [Ponyboy] Says who?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.999
Boy, those are two of the
best—looking girls I've ever seen.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.127
Yeah.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.467
- — What was that?
- Marcia's number.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.094
Probably a phoney one, too.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.555
I must have been
out of my mind to ask for it.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.932
Girl like that would never
go out with me, anyway.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.601
Where are y'all going?

18:21.684 --> 18:23.019
Home. — whoa!

18:23.102 --> 18:24.270
[Laughter] — here!

18:24.353 --> 18:26.188
I got me a new hat!

18:26.272 --> 18:28.357
[Shouting inside the house]

18:29.025 --> 18:30.818
You're crazy!

18:30.901 --> 18:34.655
I don't know why I handed you that busted
bottle. You never would have used it.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.741
I might have. Where you headed?

18:36.824 --> 18:39.660
I don't know. Maybe I'll go play
snooker or get drunk.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.579
- I'll see you later! — ok!

18:43.289 --> 18:46.334
I hate when my folks are fighting.
Let's go to the lot.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.389
It was because we're greasers, pone.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.645
Might have hurt her reputation
or something, that's all.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.480
Don't worry about it.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.940
Yeah, I guess so.

19:11.442 --> 19:12.985
[Sighs]

19:13.069 --> 19:15.154
[Train horn blares in the distance]

19:20.660 --> 19:23.245
Man, that was a tough car, huh?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.709
Mustangs, they're tough.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.004
Big—time socs, all right.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.007
It's always the same.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.724
[Shouting in the distance]

19:50.815 --> 19:53.776
I can't take
much more of this, ponyboy!

19:53.859 --> 19:57.154
I'll... I'll kill myself or something!
I don't know!

19:57.238 --> 19:58.823
[Sobs]

19:58.906 --> 20:02.493
Don't talk like that, Johnny.
Come on. You can't kill yourself.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.872
I've gotta do something.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.502
Oh, god. It seems...

20:18.300 --> 20:23.389
It seems like there's gotta be
some place without greasers and socs.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.101
There must be some place...

20:29.270 --> 20:33.357
With just plain ordinary people.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.151
People.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.655
It's like that out in the country.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.326
Away from all the big towns.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.414
Out in the country.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.423
[Ponyboy]
I miss going there with my folks.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.676
[Idyllic music]

21:08.100 --> 21:09.977
[Metal crunching]

21:10.060 --> 21:12.772
[Train bell ringing]

21:15.191 --> 21:16.859
[Johnny] Ponyboy!

21:16.942 --> 21:18.861
Pony, wake up!

21:18.944 --> 21:20.446
Come on!

21:21.197 --> 21:22.907
God! What time is it?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.242
I don't know. I went to sleep, too.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.872
You better get home, all right?

21:29.955 --> 21:33.542
I'm gonna stay all night out here.
Who'll care anyway?

21:34.543 --> 21:36.837
All right.
If you get cold, come on to my house.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.881
Yeah, all right.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.091
What is darry gonna say?

21:45.679 --> 21:47.765
[Dogs barking]

21:53.229 --> 21:56.232
Yeah, it's darry.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.359
Yeah. Bye.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.116
Where the hell have you been?
Do you know what time it is?

22:06.200 --> 22:08.285
It's two o'clock
in the morning, kiddo.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.621
Pony, where have you been?
— I feel asleep in the lot.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.623
- You what?!
- — I was talking to Johnny.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.334
And I fell asleep in the lot.
I didn't mean to.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.128
Yeah?
And I can't even call the cops

22:18.212 --> 22:20.798
because you two would be thrown
in a boys' home so fast,

22:20.881 --> 22:22.341
it would make your head spin!

22:22.424 --> 22:25.719
- Come on, pony. Let's go to bed now.
- — look, I said I didn't mean to!

22:25.803 --> 22:28.389
"I didn't mean to!" "I forgot."
That's all I ever hear from you.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.934
- Come on, darry...
- Sick and tired of you sticking up for him!

22:32.017 --> 22:33.477
Don't you yell at him!

22:35.229 --> 22:38.107
Ponyboy! I didn't mean to!

22:38.190 --> 22:40.025
[Dogs barking]

22:50.202 --> 22:52.872
[Grunts]

22:52.955 --> 22:55.583
Come on, Johnny!
Move out of the way!

23:08.095 --> 23:12.057
Take it easy, pony. It will be all right.
You just have to cool it, man.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.102
Got a cigarette, Johnny?
I'm scared to death.

23:15.185 --> 23:18.105
Well, don't be, man.
You're scaring me.

23:18.188 --> 23:21.066
What happened? — darry hit me!

23:21.150 --> 23:23.861
I swear we used to get along fine
until mum and dad died.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.988
Now he can't stand me!

23:26.071 --> 23:28.699
I think I like it better
when the old man's hitting me.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.701
At least he knows I'm there.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.705
Let's walk to the park and back.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.124
Maybe I'll cool off enough
to go home.

23:37.207 --> 23:41.045
Yeah, all right.
Ain't you about to freeze to death?

23:42.504 --> 23:44.173
You're ain't a' woofin'.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.784
Pony!

24:19.333 --> 24:21.168
Pony, got a light?

24:22.169 --> 24:24.296
Found this butt, man.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.715
Yeah, here you go, Johnny.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.552
Uh—oh. Look what's coming.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.305
This is our territory.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.391
[Johnny] I bet they're looking for us.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.146
- — Wanna split?
- Stay cool.

24:42.189 --> 24:46.986
Well, well, well.
What do you guys know?

24:47.069 --> 24:48.654
They're drunk.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.659
It's that guy with the rings, man.

24:53.742 --> 24:58.914
Aren't these the greasers
who tried to pick up on our women?

24:59.748 --> 25:02.459
Hey, you're out of your territory now.
You guys better watch it.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.128
No, pal. You better watch it.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.100
You guys know what greasers are?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.936
White trash with long greasy hair.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.314
[Chuckles]

25:30.446 --> 25:32.948
- — You know what a soc is?
- What?

25:33.032 --> 25:36.118
White trash with mustangs and Madras.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.494
Get 'em!

25:38.829 --> 25:40.581
[Shouting]

[Ponyboy coughs]

26:02.186 --> 26:03.937
[Coughs and splutters]

26:04.021 --> 26:06.523
Grab his arms! Right down!

26:10.360 --> 26:13.822
Did somebody get a drink for this
greaser, huh? Here, give me that.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.784
Come on! Have a drink, pal!

27:06.458 --> 27:08.544
[Shivers]

27:12.506 --> 27:15.884
I... I... I killed him.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.890
I killed that boy.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.894
[Whispers] I killed him.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.865
Johnny, I think I'm gonna be sick!

27:40.409 --> 27:43.203
Go ahead, man.
I ain't... I ain't gonna look at you.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.997
[Whispers] Ain't gonna look at you.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.376
[Vomits]

27:55.716 --> 27:58.218
Pony, are you all right?

28:01.555 --> 28:03.807
You really did kill 'em, huh, Johnny?

28:05.392 --> 28:06.518
[Shivers]

28:06.602 --> 28:08.187
Yeah.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.649
I had to.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.362
They, they were drowning you,
and they might have killed you!

28:21.825 --> 28:23.493
They were gonna beat me up!

28:25.287 --> 28:28.123
- — What happened to the other guys?
- Huh?

28:31.251 --> 28:33.962
They... they all ran.
They all ran off.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.256
When I stabbed him, they all ran.

- — Dally. W—w—w—we gotta see dally.
- He's busy.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.216
Just tell him it's ponyboy
and Johnny, man! He'll come!

[J' country music]

29:40.696 --> 29:42.823
What do you guys want?

29:42.906 --> 29:45.701
- — Johnny killed the soc.
- What?

29:47.119 --> 29:49.663
All right. Good for you. Let's go.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.332
We figured you could get us out,
if anyone could, dal.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.502
I... I'm sorry I got you away
from this party and all,

29:55.585 --> 29:58.338
but I just don't know
what to do, man.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.257
I was just trying to get some sleep.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.342
I got into a fight
with Shepard tonight.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.262
Let's see what we can do
about this mess. Get in.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.723
- Ponyboy, are you wet?
- — yeah, I'm ok.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.562
Hey, hey! Pony, come on, man.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.607
You'll die of pneumonia
before the cops ever get to you!

30:22.696 --> 30:24.698
Come on.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.993
Hey, stupid, take the sweatshirt off,
will you, man?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.661
You'll freeze to death.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.832
Man, I wish I had a weed now.

30:38.045 --> 30:41.256
Here. Don't point
the thing at me, will you?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.008
It's loaded. Come on.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.683
Here you go. That's 50 bucks.

30:51.767 --> 30:55.270
Look, I'm not gonna tell your brother
and get my head kicked in, man.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.064
Then don't tell him!

30:57.981 --> 31:01.026
Here. It's buck's. It's big on you,
but it's dry. Come here.

31:05.906 --> 31:09.159
Get the 3.15 train to windrixville.
It's a freight.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.121
There's an abandoned church
on top of Jay mountain.

31:14.456 --> 31:17.918
There's a pump in the back, so
you don't have to worry about water.

31:21.338 --> 31:24.132
Get a week's supply of food,
as soon as you get there,

before the story gets out.

31:30.764 --> 31:34.309
And then don't so much as stick
your noses out the door. Am I clear?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.019
Yeah.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.814
I'll be up there
as soon as I think everything's cool.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.691
Hey, relax, buddy.
Come on, man. It'll work out.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.903
All right.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.033
Man, I thought New York
was the only place

31:50.117 --> 31:51.493
I'd end up in a murder wrap.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.453
Jesus Christ!

32:05.048 --> 32:07.217
Ok, you take care, kid. Good luck.

- Johnny?

34:51.672 --> 34:54.717
Right, I got a loaf of bread,

34:54.801 --> 34:57.512
and a week's supply of baloney here.

"Gone with the wind"?

35:03.143 --> 35:05.729
Johnny, how did you know I always
wanted "gone with the wind"?

35:05.812 --> 35:08.023
I remember you saying
something about it once.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.826
Me and you went to see
that movie, remember?

35:09.858 --> 35:13.028
I thought maybe you could read it
out loud. Help kill time or something.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.447
Thanks a lot, Johnny.

- We're gonna cut our hair, ponyboy.

35:33.548 --> 35:34.883
You're gonna bleach yours.

No, sir.
You ain't gonna touch my hair.

We have to anyway, if we got caught,

the first thing the judge does
is make you get a haircut.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.645
- I don't see why.
- — I don't either.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.855
It's just the way
they're trying to break us.

35:48.938 --> 35:51.816
I'm gonna cut mine off, too,
and wash all the grease out.

35:51.900 --> 35:55.403
No, sir, you ain't touching my hair.
— ponyboy, it's gonna grow back, man.

- Sorry, man.

- Can I see now?
- — no. You gotta bleach it first.

Well, then bleach it. Quit cutting.

were headed for Texas, man.

- Cherry valance!
- — [Johnny] Cherry, the soc. Yeah.

46:07.765 --> 46:10.434
Yeah, we were hanging out
down at a vacant lot,

46:10.518 --> 46:12.520
and she pulls up
in a little old stinger, right?

46:12.603 --> 46:15.815
I thought that took a lot of nerve.
— yeah.

46:15.898 --> 46:20.069
She said that she'd testify
that the socs were drunk,

46:20.152 --> 46:22.488
and they were the ones
looking for the fight.

46:22.571 --> 46:25.533
And you guys just fought back
strictly on self-defence.

46:25.616 --> 46:26.867
So, it's cool.

46:28.244 --> 46:30.913
Man, that little broad
sure does hate me.

46:30.997 --> 46:34.333
I offered to take her for a coke,
and she told me to go to hell.

46:34.417 --> 46:35.710
I don't know.

46:36.669 --> 46:38.045
Yeah.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.173
So you think
she might like me a little bit?

46:41.257 --> 46:44.260
Huh? I think she's kinda cute.

46:45.261 --> 46:47.805
_ no? — right.

46:47.888 --> 46:50.891
What do they do for kicks round here?

to the country before.

What? What?

47:03.904 --> 47:05.614
I got a good chance
of being let off easy.

47:05.698 --> 47:08.993
It was self-defence. You just said.
Pony and cherry could testify.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.411
We won't say you helped us.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.956
I'll give you back that gun.
You won't get into any trouble, dal.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.042
- Are you sure this is what you want?
- — yeah.

47:16.125 --> 47:19.503
It ain't fair for darry and soda
to worry about ponyboy all the time.

47:20.796 --> 47:25.009
- I don't guess my folks are worried about me.
- Hey, man, the boys are worried!

to hunt for you!

47:27.720 --> 47:30.222
Dallas, I asked if my parents
asked about me.

47:30.306 --> 47:32.099
No, they didn't! So what?

47:32.183 --> 47:33.934
Do you think my old man gives a hang

47:34.018 --> 47:37.521
if I'm dead in a car wreck
or drunk or in jail or something?

47:37.605 --> 47:40.983
He doesn't care!
But that doesn't bother me none!

47:43.903 --> 47:46.489
Come on.
You're not going anywhere.

47:51.744 --> 47:56.040
I get you this hideout.
I get you a hangout, man, a hideout.

47:57.208 --> 48:00.920
And look at this. You wanna split.
This is just terrific.

48:02.671 --> 48:05.883
Johnny, you don't know what
a few months in jail can do to you.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.093
You get mean in jail.

48:07.176 --> 48:10.179
I just don't want to see it happen
to you like it happened to me.

[Exhales]

48:15.351 --> 48:16.769
[Shouting]

48:18.020 --> 48:20.898
What's going on?
— I wonder how that started?

48:20.981 --> 48:22.733
Jesus Christ!

48:32.952 --> 48:34.537
Pony, where are you going?

48:34.620 --> 48:36.622
Get over here, man!

48:36.705 --> 48:40.918
- Gerry, some of the children are missing!
- — no, they're not, Theresa.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.629
I'm sure of it. Some have been gone
for half an hour!

48:43.712 --> 48:46.173

48:46.257 --> 48:48.300
Get a hold of yourself!

Hey, come back! Come back!
Don't go in there! You'll get hurt.

What was that?

49:24.420 --> 49:26.881
Is that guy coming? — no.

49:26.964 --> 49:30.384
- How come? Too scared?

Hey, dal! Take this kid, man!
Take him!

Come on, get out of there, Johnny.
Come on, man!

- Ow!

Johnny, Dallas...
— they're all right.

51:08.065 --> 51:11.277
They're behind us.
They're in another ambulance.

51:11.360 --> 51:15.030
Anyway, you guys are the bravest kids
I've seen in a long time.

51:16.323 --> 51:18.659
What, are you guys
professional heroes or something?

51:18.742 --> 51:20.661
We're greasers.

51:21.203 --> 51:24.039
Are... are you kidding me?
— no, I ain't kidding you.

You'll find out pretty fast.

[Clears throat]

51:35.801 --> 51:38.596
You know,
you shouldn't be smoking, son.

51:38.679 --> 51:40.723
Why not?

51:40.806 --> 51:45.060
Cos you're a young man, that's why.
It's a bad habit to get into.

51:46.186 --> 51:47.771
You're smoking.

51:47.855 --> 51:50.983
I'm older than you. I've been smoking
for a long time, too.

51:51.859 --> 51:53.193
[Clears throat]

51:59.450 --> 52:02.786
Pull another stunt like that again,
I'm gonna kill you.

52:13.005 --> 52:14.632
Ponyboy!

52:18.010 --> 52:20.012
Oh, look at your tough hair.

52:23.223 --> 52:24.892
Darry, I'm sorry!

52:26.435 --> 52:29.480
[Sobs] I thought we lost you,
like we did mum and dad.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.907
You sure look funny!

52:50.834 --> 52:54.922
Let's go, little brother. We're home.

52:55.005 --> 52:58.634

— whoa!

drop my spoon.

Look at the blond-headed monkey!

53:50.144 --> 53:53.313
I wouldn't have believed it,
if! Hadn't seen it in the paper.

53:53.397 --> 53:56.650
Tell me, ponyboy,
what's it like being a hero, huh?

53:56.734 --> 53:57.985
A what?

53:58.068 --> 54:00.571
A hero, man.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.197
Beer for breakfast, two—bit?

54:03.073 --> 54:05.743
What I like is the "turn hero" bit.

54:05.826 --> 54:08.162
They're charging Johnny
with manslaughter?

54:09.288 --> 54:11.290
What do they mean, "if he recovers"?

54:11.373 --> 54:13.173
It also says how you
saved them kids, ponyboy.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.711
How they'd burned to death,
if it hadn't been for you.

54:15.794 --> 54:17.546
Dallas will be mad when he hears

54:17.629 --> 54:20.549
they didn't mention his police record.
— ain't that true.

54:21.175 --> 54:22.718
It's all about us.

54:24.553 --> 54:26.096

in a boys' home?

No way!

No, they ain't putting me
in a boys' home!

they don't do that to heroes.

anyhow?

from the state to check on us.

of a Billy goat,

you'd clean your house up,
instead of bumming around ours.

what they want?

How come?

I don't know.
I felt like playing the superhero.

58:39.307 --> 58:42.436
I wouldn't have.
— you wouldn't have what?

58:42.519 --> 58:44.896
I would have let those kids
burn to death.

58:44.980 --> 58:48.316
You might not have.
You might have done the same thing.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.776
I don't know.

58:49.860 --> 58:53.947
I just don't know
anything any more, I guess.

58:54.031 --> 58:57.325
I never would have believed a greaser
could pull something like that.

58:57.409 --> 59:00.120
A greaser didn't have
nothing to do with it.

59:00.203 --> 59:02.914
Check out their pants! [Laughs]

59:04.332 --> 59:05.792

59:19.514 --> 59:21.433
I couldn't tell this to anyone else.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.852
My friends,
they'd think I was off my rocker.

59:26.730 --> 59:30.067
That friend of yours, the one
that got burned, he might die.

59:31.318 --> 59:32.778
Yeah.

59:33.779 --> 59:37.699
And tonight, people will get hurt
at the rumble. Maybe killed, right?

you were before - at the bottom.

at the top with all the breaks.

59:54.841 --> 59:56.218
It doesn't matter.

59:56.301 --> 59:59.679

and the socs will still be socs.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.264
It doesn't matter.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.603

So what did mr super soc have to say?

01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:43.682
He ain't a soc.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.893
Just a guy that wanted to talk,
that's all.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.691
- Take care.
- See you later. Take it easy.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.192
Take it easy! [Laughs]

— [Johnny] Hey, y'all.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.250
How are they treating you, kid?

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:19.843
Look, got your picture in the paper
here for... being a hero.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.553
Look at that.

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:24.973
Yeah, that's tough enough, huh?

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:28.643
Guess you can look at it later.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.357
Do you want anything?

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.276
A book, man.

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:39.279
Can y'all get me another one?

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.823
I think he wants a copy
of "gone with the wind",

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:44.534
so I can read it to him.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.037
Would you mind going downstairs
and getting one?

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:51.416
They got a gift shop downstairs.
I'll go get it.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:11.394
I guess dal's gonna be ok.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.566
Me and darry,
we're getting along real good now.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.735
[Groans]

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:20.737
Johnny, are you ok?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.324
Oh, yeah. It just hurts sometimes.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:29.829
Usually, it don't,
cos I can't feel anything

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.706
below the middle of my back.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.668
Pretty bad off, ain't I, ponyboy?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.920
[Sobs] No.
You're gonna be all right, kid.

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:40.340
You gotta be.

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:43.343
Couldn't get along without you.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.721
I won't be able to walk again.
— huh?

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:50.016
Not even on crutches.
Doc says I busted my back.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.227
[Sniffs] You're gonna be fine.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.481
I know you are.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.693
You wanna know something, ponyboy?

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.153
I used to talk about killing myself
all the time.

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:04.572
Man, I don't wanna die now.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:08.827
It ain't long enough.
16 years ain't gonna be long enough.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.038
Hell, I wouldn't have minded so much,

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:14.791
if there wasn't so much stuff
I ain't done yet.

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:17.877
So many, so many damn things
I ain't seen or nothing.

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:23.300
That time we were up
in windrixville...

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:28.138
Was the only time I've ever been away
from our neighbourhood.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.597
[Grunts]

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.809
Knock it off.

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:36.980
If you get too juiced up,
the doc won't let us see you no more.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:45.280
Johnny, your mother's here
to see you.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.532
I don't wanna see her.

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:49.784
It's your mother.
She's here to see you.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.536
I said I don't wanna see her.

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:55.123
She probably just wants to tell me
how much trouble I'm causing.

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:57.125
Why don't you tell her
to leave me al...

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.753
[Groans]

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:02.630
- — [Two-bit] What's the matter?
- You can't see him now.

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:05.467
Pony, is he ok? — I don't know.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:06.843
He's all right.

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:10.263
- Make sure he gets this, all right?
- — ok.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.730
- What's happened to your gown?
- — I threw it away.

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:22.317
Get out! Just get out!
You make my stomach sick!

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.694
[Laughs]

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:27.364
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing, man?

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:29.949
Swiped you a gift, man.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:33.703
It's good to see you guys, man.
This place gives me the creeps.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.038
I want out.

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:36.623
[Door shuts]

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.792
Tim Shepard dropped by.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.796
Saw my picture in the paper
and couldn't believe

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:46.758
it didn't have "wanted dead or alive"
written underneath it.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.427
He started rubbing it in
about the rumble, man.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.888
I hate missing it.

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:55.725
You got a cigarette, pone?

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:58.645
Thanks.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.606
[Sighs]

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:08.446
How is he?
How's Johnny doing, man?

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:11.741
Look, dal,
I don't know about stuff like this,

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:16.121
but... but he didn't look too good.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:19.833
He passed out cold before we left.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:33.263
You still got that knife on you?

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:35.765
What? — the knife.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:38.977
Give me it, will you?

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.855
[Knife clicks]

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:46.776
Thank you.

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:51.865
You know,
we gotta win that fight tonight.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:56.619
We gotta get even with those socs!

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:05.253
Let's do it for Johnny, man.
We'll do it for Johnny!

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:15.972
Are you ok, pony?

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.019
Well, you feel kinda hot.

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:24.147
I'm ok.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.691
Be a pal and don't tell darry,
ok, two-bit?

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.862
I'll take a bunch of aspirins
when I get home.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.448
All right.

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:37.160
Darry will kill me if he finds out
you're sick, and you fight anyway.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.872
Keep your trap shut,
he won't find nothing out.

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:47.045
You know the only thing that keeps
darry from being a soc is us?

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.672
Yeah, I know.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:51.966
Come on, man.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.597
[Pony] Tonight...
I don't like it one bit.

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:01.893
Something awful is gonna happen.

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.772
[Brakes screech]

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.826
We're gonna stomp ass
on those socs tonight.

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.579
Everything's gonna be all right.
— yeah.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:25.625
[Chatting and shouting]

01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:32.340
[Ponyboy] Tough little kids, huh?
— [two—bit] Yeah. Future greasers.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:34.425
[Ponyboy] Yeah!

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:36.052
[Cherry] Ponyboy!

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.596
Hey, two—bit!

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:45.436
What's up with the big times?

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.231
[Sighs] No weapons.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.317
They play your way. It's a fair deal.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.611
Are you sure about that?

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.822
Well, Randy told me.
He knows for sure.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.576
Good deal. Thanks, cherry.

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:03.746
Ponyboy, wait a minute.

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.540
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:10.920
How's Johnny doing?

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:14.591
Not so good.
Would you come up and see him?

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.926
- No, I couldn't. — why not?

01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:20.138
I couldn't.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.975
He killed Bob!

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:28.854
Maybe Bob asked for it.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.566
I know he did.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:32.649
[Sighs]

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:36.779
But you didn't know his other side.
He could be real sweet.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.783
He wasn't just any boy.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.412
Bob had something
that made him different.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:49.207
Made people follow him. Maybe better
than the crowd. You know what I mean?

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.961
That's ok.
I don't want you to go see him.

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.921
We don't need your damn charity!

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:57.300
Ponyboy!

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.845
I wasn't trying to give you charity!

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.850
I only wanted to help.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.647
I liked you from the start.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.482
The way we talked.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:16.861
Wouldn't you try to help me
if you thought you could?

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:22.533
Can you see the sunset
from the southside very good?

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.786
Yeah, real good.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:28.372
You can see it
from the northside, too.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:29.916
[Chuckles]

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:33.627
Thanks, ponyboy. You dig ok.

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.631
See you around.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:54.524
- Soda, when did you start shaving?
- — when I was 15.

01:09:56.484 --> 01:10:00.279
When did, when did darry?
— when he was 13.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.783
Why? Figuring on growing
a beard for the rumble?

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.493
Oh, you're funny(!)

01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:08.037
Maybe I'll send you
into the reader's digest.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:10.123
They pay a lot of money
for funny things.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.625
Let's go, then. — forget it.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:15.670
- Come on. Come on, soda.
- — you like fights, huh, soda?

01:10:15.753 --> 01:10:18.798
Yeah, I like fights, man.
— you like fights, huh?

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.883
- — How come?
- It's a contest.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:23.052
It's like a drag race,
or a dance or something.

01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:26.097
[Two—bit] We're gonna beat
them socs' heads in, ain't we?

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.891
When I get into a fight,
I wanna stomp! I like it, too.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.185
[Grunts]

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:34.397
Why do you like fights, darry?

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.774
He likes to show off his muscles!

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:40.153
Hey, I'm gonna show 'em off on you,
if you get any mouthier!

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:45.032
Hey, pony...

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.870
I don't know if you ought to be
in this rumble.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.914
How come? I've always
come through before, ain't I?

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:56.335
Yeah, but, you know,
you was in shape before, and...

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:01.048
You know, you ain't looking so good.
You're tensed up all the time.

01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:04.969
Come on, darry, let him fight, man.
Everyone's tensed up before a rumble.

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:07.972
It's skin against skin.
He ain't gonna get hurt, is he?

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.268
Come on.
I'll grab hold of a little one.

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:15.521
We will need every man we can get,
but... I don't know.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:18.566
If it was with knives or chains,
it'd be different.

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:21.360
I'll be ok.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:25.698
- — All right, but you be careful, ok?
- I will be.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:28.367
How come you never
worry about him so much?

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:31.871
Man, that's one kid brother
I ain't gotta worry about.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:35.374
This kid can use his head. At least
for one thing, to grow hair on!

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.084
Get out!

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.380
[Shouting and cheering]

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.510
[Cheering and laughter]

01:11:47.428 --> 01:11:52.475
All right! Yeah! Go, go, go!

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.687
Come on, come on, come on!
What do you think?

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.231
Woo—how!

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.318
- Come on! Come on! — woo!

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.862
You and ponyboy, if the fuzz show,
beat it out of there.

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:07.824
We'll getjailed,
but you two will get the boys' home.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.659
Know what I'm saying?

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.870
Ain't nobody gonna call the fuzz
in this neighbourhood!

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.000
All the same, you two beat it
out of there. Do you hear me?

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.126
Yeah, bro.

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:36.269
How are you doing, Tim?

01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:38.604
Pretty good.

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:44.485
You and the quiet kid were the ones
who killed the soc, right?

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:47.989
- — Yeah.
- Good going, kid.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.283
Curly always said
you were a good kid.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:54.537
Curly's in the reformatory
for the next six months.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:26.611
[Chatting]

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:43.210
[Thunder rumbles]

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.651
[Chatting and laughter]

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.910
The odds are as even as we can get.
You stay close to me, kid.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.665
[Chatting]

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:39.433
Hello, darrel. Long time no see.

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:41.519
Hello, Paul.

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:43.020
What's up?

01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:45.773
They used to buddy around together,
play football.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.566
I'll take you.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.319
You know, a rumble
ain't a rumble without me!

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.491
[Shouting]

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:05.126

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.796
[Shouting]

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:03.726
[Darrel] Ponyboy!

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:24.205
[Darrel] Ponyboy!

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:26.290

01:16:26.373 --> 01:16:28.459
[Shouting]

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.178
What are you guys doing?

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:42.098
Let's get out of here!

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:52.149
Ponyboy, are you ok?

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:55.778
[Cheering]

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:13.337
Are you ok? Come on.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.673
[Cheering]

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:17.758
Woo! Yeah!

[Siren wails]

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:46.287
W—w-wait. Act sick. I'll pretend
like I'm taking you to the hospital.

01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:50.624
You've got to have a good reason
for driving like that.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:54.003
Uh, the kid fell off his motorcycle.
I'm taking him to the hospital.

01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:01.635
[Groans]

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:04.346
- How bad is he?
- — I don't know, man.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.433
Do I look like a doctor?
He looks pretty bad to me.

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:08.976
Follow me. — all right.

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:13.230
Sucker!

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.324
[Siren wails]

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.208
Man.

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.799
I was crazy. You know that, kid?

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:44.220
I was crazy about wanting Johnny
to stay out of trouble, man.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:47.389
If he was smart like me,
he wouldn't have been in this mess.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:50.643
If he was smart like me,
he wouldn't have ran in that church!

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:57.024
You better wise up, pony, man.
You just better wise up, man.

01:18:57.107 --> 01:18:59.443
You get tough like me,
and you don't get hurt!

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:05.616
Watch out for yourself,
and nothing can touch you, man!

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:23.717
Hey, Johnny.

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:25.970
We beat the socs, man.

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:28.847
We chased them right out
of our neighbourhood.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.850
Go on. — it's useless.

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:36.105
- Huh? — fighting ain't no good.

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:42.319
You know, they're still writing
editorials about you in the papers,

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:44.738
you know, about you being a hero.

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:49.410
We're all proud of you, buddy.
It's gonna be all right.

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:51.537
Ponyboy...

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:55.082
[Whispers] Ponyboy...

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.255
S-S-S...

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:04.550
Stay gold, ponyboy.

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:07.720
[Whispers] Stay gold.

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:20.858
Johnny, come on.

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:27.323
S-So, this is what you get, huh?

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.658
This is what you get
for helping people?

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.579
You punk!

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.582
Come on, Johnny! Don't die!

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:39.752
Come on.

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:43.881
Come on, Johnny. Don't die on me now.

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:46.717
Please.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.011
[Sobs]

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:54.975

[Sobs]

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.258
Hey, you, you're not allowed here.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.931
I'm allowed anywhere I want.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:35.474
[Gun clicks]

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.745
- [Gun clicks]
- You're out of your mind.

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:42.815
Why do you bother helping people?
It doesn't do any good!

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:48.070
What do you think, soda?
Do you think it makes me look tough?

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:52.616
I think it makes you look different.

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.868
That guy had sharp teeth.

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:57.788
What do you mean by "different"?

01:21:57.871 --> 01:21:59.790
You got a hole in your mouth.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.335
[Door slams shut]

01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:06.296
[Darrel] Hey, where you been?

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:15.806
Hey, pony, what...? What's wrong?

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.060
Johnny's dead.

01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:28.777
I told him about beating the socs.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:33.490
I don't know... he just died.
Told me to "stay gold".

01:22:35.325 --> 01:22:36.952
Hey, pony.

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:38.787
Dally's gone.

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.833
He couldn't take it. He's gonna blow.

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.174
[Assistant clears throat]

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.018
[Clears throat]

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:09.568
Do you wanna buy one of those, son?

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:19.411
You tear those up, you have
to pay for 'em. Don't do that.

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:29.421
You know,
you gotta pay for that magazine.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.886
Oh, god. Don't shoot.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:40.140
Give me the money.
Give me the money!

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:42.017
I'm so sick of you punks.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:44.019
Take it and get out of here!

01:24:11.672 --> 01:24:13.799
- [Steve] Yeah? — hello, darrel?

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.551
No, it's Steve. Dally?

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:18.679
- — Steve, I want to talk to darry.
- Yeah, sure.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.306
Hello?

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.350
- All right, darry, listen.
- — yeah?

01:24:23.433 --> 01:24:27.813
I just knocked off a store, man.
The cops are looking for me.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:30.857
- Can you meet me in the park?
- Sure, dal. Are you all right?

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:32.859
Yeah. Johnny's dead. — we know.

01:24:32.943 --> 01:24:34.486
Johnny...

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:37.864
- — Meet me in the park, will you?
- Hang on. We'll be right there.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:43.370
That was dally. The cops
are after him. We gotta hide him.

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:49.710
[Tyres screech]

[Sirens wail]

01:25:01.138 --> 01:25:03.765
- — You're never gonna get me alive!
- [Policeman] Drop it!

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:07.603
It's not loaded! Don't! — stop!

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:10.063
- [Ponyboy] It's not loaded!
- — [gunshot]

01:25:10.147 --> 01:25:11.273
[Ponyboy] No!

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:13.108
- — No!
- [Gunshots]

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:15.193
[Darrel] He's just a kid!

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.827
- [Ponyboy] No! — pony?

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:11.583
Ponyboy, I asked the nurse
to give you this book,

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:14.002
so you could finish it.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:17.839
It was worth saving those kids.
Their lives are worth more than mine.

01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:20.425
They have more to live for.

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:22.511
Tell dally I think it's worth it.

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:25.847
I'm gonna miss you guys.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:30.560
I've been thinking about it, and
that poem, that guy that wrote it.

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:35.941
He meant you're gold
when you're a kid. Like green.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:38.068
When you're a kid everything's new.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.445
Dawn.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:44.282
Like the way you dig sunsets, pony.
That's gold.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.869
Keep it that way.
It's a good way to be.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.415
I want you to ask dally
to look at one.

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:53.709
I don't think
he's ever seen a sunset.

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:57.754
There's still lots of good
in the world.

01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:01.258
Tell dally. I don't think he knows.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:04.845
Your buddy, Johnny.
