in association with egg films

00:50.509 --> 00:52.090
What?

00:52.761 --> 00:57.471
I said... I just wanted to speak.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.431
What the hell?

00:59.560 --> 01:02.097
What's with the way you fucking talk?

01:03.146 --> 01:06.513
Who the fuck are you?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.239
My...

01:17.828 --> 01:19.068
Name is...

01:21.999 --> 01:23.409
Oh...

01:24.876 --> 01:26.332
_dae-su.

01:26.878 --> 01:31.212
- Stop hitting on his girlfriend.
- Hold on.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.341
Mr oh dae-su!

01:32.467 --> 01:35.129
Did I hit on her? Did I?

01:35.262 --> 01:38.004
Okay! Okay!

01:41.893 --> 01:44.930
Oh dae-su, sit down.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.185
You've had too much to drink.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.061
I need to piss first.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.358
Who the hell did I hit on?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.197
You son of a bitch!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.777
Arsehole!

02:02.664 --> 02:03.528
Sit down!

02:03.665 --> 02:05.371
I'm very sorry.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.748
Fuck, I gotta piss bad.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.000
- Cute, huh?
- It is, so sit down.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.006
Today's my daughter's birthday.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.172
I got her a present for her birthday.

02:19.723 --> 02:23.181
Snatches of clouds
float in the sky

02:23.310 --> 02:26.052
a pleasure boat
floats in the river

02:26.188 --> 02:29.396
my name, oh dae-su, means...

02:30.901 --> 02:34.359
"Getting along with people."

02:34.488 --> 02:37.275
That's why I'm oh dae-su.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.147
But, shit...

02:40.202 --> 02:43.444
Why can't I get along today?

02:43.580 --> 02:45.696
Set me free!

02:47.584 --> 02:50.826
- Shut the hell up!
- Set me free!

03:09.189 --> 03:10.929
Let go of me, damn it!

03:13.026 --> 03:15.267
Get away from me!

03:15.404 --> 03:16.940
Grab him!

03:22.744 --> 03:26.953
I'l make sure he doesn't get drunk
and cause trouble again.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.539
Have a nice day, officer.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.659
But he's usually a nice guy.

03:31.795 --> 03:32.875
Let's go.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.245
I'll come and visit you soon.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.919
We don't want you to come back.

03:38.051 --> 03:42.260
- That's up to me, you arseholes.
- Hey!

03:44.975 --> 03:48.809
My sweet pea, it's daddy.
It's daddy.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.974
Daddy got my little sweet pea
a present.

03:52.107 --> 03:55.474
I'll be home soon with your gift,
so wait a bit longer.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.725
Let me talk to her.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.945
- Good girl, good.
- Give me the phone.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.780
Yeun-hee, joo-hwan wants to talk to you.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.072
You know joo-hwan, right? Hold on.

04:07.664 --> 04:11.907
Hi, yeun-hee. It's me, joo-hwan.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.957
So today's your birthday?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.079
Happy birthday.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.958
I'll treat you to something nice
tomorrow.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.177
Hello? Oh, hello, ja-hyun.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.594
I'm sorry.
I know it's very late.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.091
Dae-su is on his way now.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.676
I'm sorry. Yes?

04:31.813 --> 04:34.646
Hold on. Dae-su, it's your wife.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.433
Dae-su!

04:39.821 --> 04:41.436
Dae-su!

04:58.590 --> 05:01.832
Your wife wants you to hurry home!

05:01.968 --> 05:04.926
Dae-su, let's go! Stop playing games!

06:08.159 --> 06:09.695
Sir, sir.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.865
Wait, come here.
Come and talk to me.

06:12.998 --> 06:16.786
I won't tell you to let me go.

06:16.918 --> 06:21.082
Just tell me why I'm here, okay?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.455
I should know the reason at least.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.834
Shit, I've been locked up here
for two months already.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.552
Sir, wait, come here.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.841
Sir, wait. What is this place?

06:33.977 --> 06:38.346
Sir, just tell me how long
I have to stay in here.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.891
Sir!

06:40.775 --> 06:42.436
Fuck you!

06:42.569 --> 06:45.777
Come here, you arsehole.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.029
Son of a bitch!

06:49.159 --> 06:52.071
I saw your face, arsehole.
You're dead if I get out.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.870
I'm sorry. I won't swear.

06:55.999 --> 07:00.208
Just tell me.
One month, two, or three?

07:01.838 --> 07:07.253
Hey, where are you going?
Just tell me how long, you son of a bitch!

07:07.385 --> 07:11.924
I said tell me how long, you arsehole!

07:12.515 --> 07:14.597
You son of a bitch!

07:16.269 --> 07:18.681
You fucking arseholes!

07:20.649 --> 07:24.392
If they had told me
it was going to be 15 years,

07:25.528 --> 07:28.235
would it have been easier to endure?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.439
Or would it have not?

07:32.535 --> 07:34.776
Laugh, and the world
laughs with you.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.949
Weep, and you weep alone.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.330
When the melody turns on,
gas comes out.

07:55.767 --> 07:59.225
When the gas comes,
I fall asleep.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.524
I found out later

08:06.653 --> 08:11.113
that it's the same valium gas
that the Russian soldiers used

08:11.241 --> 08:13.232
on the chechen terrorists.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.869
When I wake up,
my hair has been cut.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.328
I don't like the style really.

08:27.132 --> 08:32.126
But they change my clothes,
and clean the place up.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.553
Gracious bastards.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.341
One!

08:40.895 --> 08:42.726
Two!

08:44.190 --> 08:45.771
Three!

08:47.360 --> 08:50.147
It's too spicy.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.613
I don't want spinach. You eat it.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.825
I won't eat spinach.
I don't want to eat spinach.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.662
Kim ja-hyun's body was found
with a deep stab wound in the neck.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.782
Being a cold-blooded murder
with nothing valuable stolen,

09:03.918 --> 09:08.708
police suspect that the motive
was out of hatred.

09:08.840 --> 09:13.459
Her husband, oh dae-su, disappeared
a year ago and is being searched for.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.382
According to witnesses,
oh dae-su drank often,

09:17.223 --> 09:19.509
causing trouble with his wife,

09:19.642 --> 09:23.134
and neighbours said
they fought frequently.

09:23.646 --> 09:28.060
Blood samples found at the scene
matched oh dae-su's.

09:28.193 --> 09:33.028
Fingerprints found on a cup
also matched oh dae-su's.

09:33.156 --> 09:38.196
Sources said that oh dae-su
undoubtedly visited his wife recently.

09:39.746 --> 09:44.490
The stolen family photo album, the only
missing item, also backs their theories.

10:17.158 --> 10:22.619
After three years, many wrinkles
have formed on his face.

10:34.843 --> 10:40.509
If you stand aimlessly
at a phone booth on a rainy day,

10:40.640 --> 10:44.428
and meet a man whose face
is covered by a Violet umbrella,

10:44.561 --> 10:48.930
I'd suggest
that you get close to the TV.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.065
The television is both
a clock and calendar.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.106
It's your school, your home,

10:56.239 --> 10:57.854
your church,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.947
your friend,

11:00.076 --> 11:01.691
and your lover.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.030
But...

11:04.164 --> 11:06.621
The face I miss

11:08.334 --> 11:11.826
longing for that intimate person

11:12.881 --> 11:15.497
staying up all night alone

11:17.635 --> 11:20.502
for that face I miss

11:26.186 --> 11:29.519
But my lover's song...

11:31.733 --> 11:33.564
Is too short.

11:41.409 --> 11:45.527
Today at 7:50am,
the middle of Seoul's sangsu bridge

11:45.663 --> 11:47.904
suddenly collapsed 50 metres...

11:48.041 --> 11:53.707
I wrote down all the people I fought,
bothered, and hurt.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.880
This was both my prison journal

12:01.012 --> 12:03.094
and autobiography of my evil deeds.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.926
I thought I had lived an average life,

12:12.398 --> 12:14.229
but I have sinhed so much.

12:21.324 --> 12:25.112
All I thought about at that moment

12:25.912 --> 12:30.246
was that the guy next door
probably ate with one chopstick.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.995
But...

12:35.964 --> 12:37.295
But...

12:45.014 --> 12:47.426
Who would've imprisoned me?

12:48.393 --> 12:52.887
Was it yoo heung-Sam?
Lee so-young or kang Chang-suk?

12:53.856 --> 12:56.142
Whoever it was, just wait.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.684
Wait a little more.

12:59.821 --> 13:03.063
I'll rip your whole body apart,

13:03.199 --> 13:06.612
and no one will be able
to find your body anywhere.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.445
Because I'm going
to chew it all down.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.262
One line for one year.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.775
I have to sew six lines at first.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.070
I guess next year will be easier.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.159
The more the tattoos,
the shorter the chopstick.

13:52.332 --> 13:56.826
The shorter the chopstick,
the bigger the hole gets.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.789
Anyway...

14:01.215 --> 14:03.797
Time passes well.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.796
9 years.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.310
10 years.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.489
11 years.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.273
Ex-president roh tae-woqoo
arrested

14:34.791 --> 14:35.871
Hong Kong handover ceremony

14:42.882 --> 14:43.997
Princess Diana's funeral

14:44.133 --> 14:45.964
official approval of imf fund

14:48.137 --> 14:49.627
12 years.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.255
Presidential inauguration

14:57.980 --> 14:59.580
President Kim dae-jung
visits North Korea

15:07.115 --> 15:08.480
World cup in Korea

15:09.951 --> 15:11.691
13 years.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.111
Roh moo-hyun elected president

15:15.248 --> 15:16.658
14 years.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.109
I'll be out in a month.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.604
I'll be out in one month.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.823
I'll be out.
I'll be out after a month.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.695
I'll be out of here.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.618
I'll be out in a month.
In exactly one month.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.494
I'll need money when I get out,
so what should I do?

16:04.630 --> 16:07.463
Should I steal or Rob?

16:07.592 --> 16:11.460
What should I eat first?
Kimchee soup? Eel barbecue?

16:11.596 --> 16:13.837
Anything but fried dumplings.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.221
Where am I anyway?

16:16.350 --> 16:19.558
With all the cars honking,
it must be the city.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.724
The most important thing
is what floor I'm on.

16:22.857 --> 16:26.691
What if I Pierce through the wall
and it's the 52nd floor?

16:26.819 --> 16:30.607
Even if I fall to my death,
I'm still getting out.

16:30.740 --> 16:35.530
I'm getting out.
In one month, I'm getting out.

17:03.648 --> 17:08.142
Right now, you're lying on a plain.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.694
When you hear the bell,

17:13.824 --> 17:18.614
you will turn your head
and look down.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.664
You will see an endless field
of green grass.

17:29.298 --> 17:34.418
The sun is shining bright,
and there's a cool breeze.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.275
It's a human being.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.777
Don't stop me!

19:20.201 --> 19:22.237
Mister...

19:22.370 --> 19:28.457
Even though I'm no worse
than a beast,

19:31.462 --> 19:34.795
don't I have the right to live?

19:40.388 --> 19:41.798
Mister...

19:42.765 --> 19:46.508
Even though... I'm no worse...

19:47.728 --> 19:49.309
Than a beast...

19:53.484 --> 19:56.726
Don't I have the right...

19:59.865 --> 20:01.321
To live?

20:02.368 --> 20:03.574
Yes.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.467
That phone booth alley was just here.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.514
Now there's an apartment building.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.725
So he throws me on the roof.
What a dimwit.

20:37.903 --> 20:42.488
I want to tell you my story.
Delay your death.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.232
What?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.420
What the hell?

21:02.636 --> 21:06.128
I said I just wanted to speak.
I see. Now I'll tell you my story.

21:09.101 --> 21:13.435
The reason why I want to die...

21:17.443 --> 21:18.933
Hey!

21:23.240 --> 21:25.231
It's a human female.

21:54.188 --> 21:58.477
Laugh,
and the world laughs with you.

21:59.026 --> 22:02.814
Weep, and you weep alone.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.491
My home is gone.

22:10.204 --> 22:13.287
I can't call either
my friend or relatives.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.997
Since I'm my wife's murderer.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.996
Since I'm a fugitive.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.315
You dickshit!

23:01.088 --> 23:02.578
"Dickshit.â

23:03.591 --> 23:05.582
That's a hew one.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.585
Since the TV doesn't teach you
swear words.

23:17.938 --> 23:23.433
Can imaginary training
for 15 years be put to use?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.237
It can.

23:38.709 --> 23:43.749
Oplegnathus fasciatus.

23:43.881 --> 23:47.123
Lives in the warm waters
of coastal reefs.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.584
A fish with weak reflexes,

23:49.720 --> 23:53.713
but it can resist unyieldingly
once it's caught on a hook.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.215
In kyungsang province,
its offspring...

23:57.478 --> 23:59.093
What's that smell?

24:11.784 --> 24:15.618
Don't even think about
asking me any questions.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.078
I don't know a thing.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.514
Yes?

24:39.228 --> 24:43.437
I said I want something alive.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.483
Oh, right. Long time no see.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.448
This is my first time.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.861
Maybe not?

24:55.995 --> 24:58.111
But she looks familiar.

24:59.498 --> 25:04.037
You look very familiar.
Have we met before?

25:04.586 --> 25:07.794
"Searching for the best chefs."

25:07.923 --> 25:10.710
"On mbc every Thursday at 6:30."

25:10.843 --> 25:13.175
"The youngest female chef
of Japanese food."

25:13.303 --> 25:14.918
Oh, that?

25:15.472 --> 25:18.680
They said the ratings are low,
but I guess it's popular.

25:18.809 --> 25:22.472
Women's hands are usually warm,
so they can't make Sushi.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.471
Wow, you sure do know a lot.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.110
Who are you?

25:43.417 --> 25:46.659
Do you like your clothes?

25:52.843 --> 25:54.504
Why?

25:56.847 --> 26:00.089
- Why did you imprison me?
- Who do you think I am?

26:02.144 --> 26:04.635
- Yoo heung-Sam?
- Wrong.

26:04.772 --> 26:08.515
- Did Lee so-young hire you?
- No, wrong again.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.186
Lee jong-yong?

26:10.736 --> 26:12.317
Kang Chang-suk?

26:12.863 --> 26:15.525
Hwang joo-yeun? Kim na-sung?

26:15.657 --> 26:17.067
Park ji-woo?

26:17.201 --> 26:19.237
Im duk-yoon? Lee jae-pyung?
Kuk su-ran?

26:19.369 --> 26:22.111
- Who the hell are you?
- Me?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.697
I'm sort of a scholar.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.203
And my main subject is you.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.244
A scholar studying oh dae-su.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.917
An expert on oh dae-su.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.466
Who I am isn't important.
Why is important.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.210
Think it over.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.588
Review your whole lifetime.

26:41.308 --> 26:45.051
Since school is over,
it's time for your homework, right?

26:46.897 --> 26:49.013
Keep this in mind.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.891
"Be it a grain of sand or a rock,

26:52.402 --> 26:54.734
"in water they sink as the same."

26:55.697 --> 26:57.562
Let me ask you one thing.

26:58.117 --> 27:02.360
You hypnotised me in there,
didn't you?

27:03.413 --> 27:05.779
What did you do to me?

27:05.916 --> 27:09.534
I miss you.
Hurry and come to me.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.175
Here you are.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.556
It's alive, right?

27:29.606 --> 27:32.018
I'll slice it up now.

28:07.895 --> 28:11.808
I must be a different breed of woman.
My hands are very cold.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.398
What's she doing?

28:20.324 --> 28:21.359
Sir.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.075
Sir, wake up!

28:26.872 --> 28:28.954
Keep this in mind.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.916
"Be it a grain of sand or a rock,

28:34.004 --> 28:37.667
"in water they sink as the same."

28:44.014 --> 28:45.675
Are you awake?

28:56.068 --> 28:57.899
Is this true?

29:18.924 --> 29:21.210
That fever remedy really works.

29:22.719 --> 29:26.758
Why did you faint
if you trained so much?

29:28.225 --> 29:34.437
A lack of needed sunlight depletes you
of vitamins a and e.

29:36.108 --> 29:39.350
So I'm not immune to influenza.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.653
Do you usually talk that way?

29:56.378 --> 29:59.211
The bathroom door is broken
and doesn't lock.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.170
Don't get any bright ideas.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.666
Or else I'll slice you like Sushi.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.128
What's this?

30:07.264 --> 30:08.970
Suppositories.

30:09.099 --> 30:12.262
How else could I feed you medicine
if you'd fainted?

30:26.491 --> 30:31.451
Can imaginary training
for 15 years be put to use?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.581
It can't.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.512
That was very bad of me.

31:02.652 --> 31:07.692
Since I turned you down
after bringing you here,

31:07.824 --> 31:09.940
I understand why you're mad.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.155
I do.

31:15.415 --> 31:19.749
You know, I brought you here
because I like you, too.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.705
But...

31:24.257 --> 31:26.839
You even don't know my name.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.047
I'm mi-do.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.420
You see...

31:33.016 --> 31:34.506
Later on,

31:35.894 --> 31:38.180
when I'm really ready,

31:38.855 --> 31:42.097
I swear on my life that I will.

31:43.276 --> 31:47.565
That song, the face I miss,
in your diary is the sign.

31:47.697 --> 31:52.191
When I sing it,
then get yourself ready.

31:54.579 --> 31:59.073
I could resist again

31:59.209 --> 32:01.416
in the heat of the moment.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.669
But no matter what,
don't back out.

32:04.798 --> 32:07.585
Just sock it to me!

32:10.303 --> 32:11.713
Sock it...

32:13.390 --> 32:14.846
To me?

32:20.730 --> 32:22.345
The ants...

32:23.358 --> 32:25.770
Do you still see them?

32:25.902 --> 32:27.733
Do you still feel that way?

32:29.239 --> 32:33.107
Yeah, if you're alone,
you see the ants.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.743
Very lonely people that I met,

32:36.872 --> 32:39.363
they all hallucinated ants
at one time.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.783
I tried to figure out why once.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.410
Ants move around in groups,
you know.

32:46.840 --> 32:51.300
So I guess very lonely people
keep thinking about ants.

32:52.262 --> 32:55.095
Even though I never did.

33:57.494 --> 34:00.281
She called from overseas
five or six years ago,

34:00.413 --> 34:02.654
asking if her dad had showed up.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.575
She doesn't even know
that he killed her mother.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.580
Since she hardly has any relatives,
she calls us.

34:12.592 --> 34:15.583
Her Korean has got worse.

34:16.929 --> 34:20.047
I think her Swedish foster parents
are both doctors.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.766
Anyhow, miss reporter,

34:27.440 --> 34:32.355
dae-su really hasn't been caught yet?

34:36.491 --> 34:39.402
Your daughter's address
is on the front,

34:39.536 --> 34:42.402
and on the back is a map
to your wife's grave.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.369
Eva...

34:48.085 --> 34:50.873
Stockholm. Eva...

34:52.507 --> 34:54.589
Do you want to call her?

35:01.057 --> 35:03.093
Want me to call her?

35:08.732 --> 35:10.814
Want to visit the grave together?

35:17.574 --> 35:21.692
No, after I kill that bastard first.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.345
Blue dragon

35:52.525 --> 35:53.935
is it right?

35:54.069 --> 35:56.105
I haven't chewed it yet.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.062
Blue dragon

36:02.535 --> 36:03.945
so?

36:05.372 --> 36:07.203
Was that the taste?

36:20.303 --> 36:23.045
Be it ten or a hundred restaurants,
it doesn't matter.

36:25.475 --> 36:28.467
I can never forget that taste
for 15 years.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.438
Blue dragon

36:56.923 --> 36:59.335
Want me to make you an ID
to log in?

37:00.176 --> 37:02.337
Do you have
a favourite movie or song?

37:04.347 --> 37:08.431
I've already talked...

37:09.352 --> 37:10.637
To him.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.360
The count of monte cristo?

37:22.031 --> 37:27.401
There's no one... by that name here.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.545
How's life in a bigger prison,
oh dae-su?

37:39.674 --> 37:41.289
Who are you?

37:43.928 --> 37:47.170
Who are you?

37:48.224 --> 37:50.304
The lonely prince in
the high tower. Don't forget me.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.099
Who's this bastard?

37:57.275 --> 38:00.642
I don't know him.
I just chat with him sometimes.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.770
And talk about Sushi, too.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.614
Where are you going?

38:22.175 --> 38:25.713
- Where are you going?
- I can't trust you.

38:41.528 --> 38:42.938
Magic...

38:43.071 --> 38:45.813
Magic blue dragon
Chinese restaurant

38:45.949 --> 38:49.487
what could
the magic blue dragon mean?

39:01.673 --> 39:04.415
Why'd they order
from a restaurant this far away?

39:05.677 --> 39:08.544
I've gone by five
Chinese restaurants already.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.340
My lungs feel like exploding.

39:20.650 --> 39:25.360
Tell your cooks to put
less scallions in the dumplings.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.904
Sure.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.700
- Leave it and go.
- Okay.

40:18.291 --> 40:22.204
We don't work on anyone
being protected by bodyguards.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.498
There are others who specialise in that.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.672
You can hire them.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.837
We just work on the small fries.

40:31.888 --> 40:35.676
If it's over six months,
transportation is free.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.511
Yes, of course.

40:44.817 --> 40:47.399
Why'd you lock me up, you...

40:49.197 --> 40:50.903
_dickshit?

40:52.617 --> 40:58.328
In our 7.5 floor business,
our clients' info is top secret.

41:17.850 --> 41:21.183
I'm going to pay you back
for all 15 years.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.180
Each one I yank out
will make you age one year.

41:41.416 --> 41:42.622
Stay still.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.081
Ready to talk?

42:13.531 --> 42:15.567
I don't know.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.442
I didn't see his face.

42:18.578 --> 42:21.115
I recorded it.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.292
Oh dae-su

42:42.435 --> 42:45.472
Ab blood types, raise your hand.

42:58.326 --> 43:01.284
Go. He's lost a lot of blood.

46:31.289 --> 46:36.079
I can't get along today, either.

46:37.712 --> 46:41.671
I've how become a monster.

46:42.967 --> 46:45.083
When my vengeance is over,

46:46.220 --> 46:48.381
can I return as the old dae-su?

46:53.769 --> 46:56.886
Mister, are you alright?

46:57.023 --> 46:59.105
Look at all this blood.

46:59.233 --> 47:03.101
Mister, what happened to you?

47:08.576 --> 47:11.943
Saewoon apartments in eung-am,
building 8. Take care of him.

47:13.497 --> 47:16.489
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

47:17.376 --> 47:19.287
Well, then...

47:20.921 --> 47:22.786
Farewell, oh dae-su.

47:26.093 --> 47:29.756
Farewell... oh dae-su.

47:31.599 --> 47:32.964
Farewell.

47:34.602 --> 47:35.967
Farewell.

48:32.493 --> 48:34.859
Any bastard you hate,
but dare to kill.

48:34.995 --> 48:37.907
Any bitch you detest,
but want to more than kill.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.871
We are at your service.

48:41.293 --> 48:44.501
Wouldn't he go crazy
if he's locked up for a long time?

48:44.630 --> 48:49.545
Well, if you prefer he doesn't,
we can mix drugs into his drink.

48:49.677 --> 48:52.168
Ristedal solution.

48:52.304 --> 48:56.388
It's a well-trusted drug,
used to treat schizophrenia.

48:57.143 --> 49:02.888
Well, the duration is important,
so how long will he...?

49:03.023 --> 49:04.433
15 years.

49:06.527 --> 49:07.937
Too long?

49:08.070 --> 49:09.935
What did he do?

49:10.739 --> 49:15.824
Oh dae-su, you see...
Talks too much.

49:18.205 --> 49:19.695
Go to sleep.

49:20.458 --> 49:23.450
Time to visit joo-hwan
at the Internet cafe tomorrow.

49:33.971 --> 49:36.462
Sit wherever you'd like.

49:38.350 --> 49:39.465
Joo-hwan.

49:51.280 --> 49:55.398
Oh dae-su, you see...
Talks too much.

49:59.747 --> 50:01.738
Heard this voice before?

50:02.917 --> 50:05.579
Is there anyone
who hates me this much?

50:12.551 --> 50:14.963
How should I know

50:15.095 --> 50:19.304
all the 260 names
of your women's husbands?

50:19.433 --> 50:22.766
Monster

50:28.651 --> 50:30.266
Mi-do

50:32.780 --> 50:36.443
- who's mi-do?
- This girl who cries over nothing.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.236
Joo-hwan.

50:44.959 --> 50:46.415
Did I...

50:47.044 --> 50:49.251
Really talk too much?

50:52.633 --> 50:55.340
My friend,

50:55.469 --> 51:01.886
I'd like for you to find that criminal
among people you're close to.

51:04.436 --> 51:07.143
Search: Evergreen

51:12.987 --> 51:14.147
Evergreen invites you to chat

51:18.325 --> 51:19.565
congratulations,

51:19.702 --> 51:22.569
your case was automatically
dismissed yesterday.

51:22.705 --> 51:24.821
But remember this by all means.

51:24.957 --> 51:26.663
Open quote.

51:28.168 --> 51:31.285
"Like a gazelle
from the hand of the hunter.

51:31.422 --> 51:35.711
"Like a bird
from the snare of the Fowler.

51:35.843 --> 51:37.424
"Free yourself."

51:41.015 --> 51:43.472
- Close quote.
- Who are you?

51:43.601 --> 51:46.343
What about you, you rotten bastard?

51:47.354 --> 51:49.720
I made up my mind
when I was imprisoned.

51:49.857 --> 51:52.098
That I won't trust anyone if I get out.

51:52.693 --> 51:55.150
If there's anyone who I find suspicious,

51:55.279 --> 51:58.237
then I'll create a secret
that only I and that person will know.

52:03.704 --> 52:07.743
You led a stranger to your place.
Who the hell are you?

52:16.842 --> 52:18.673
Who's evergreen?

52:26.101 --> 52:30.265
I tracked down that evergreen ID,
and found the owner's hame.

52:30.397 --> 52:32.854
- Ready to jot it down?
- Go ahead.

52:32.983 --> 52:35.315
It's su dae-oh.

52:35.444 --> 52:37.105
- Strange surname.
- Address?

52:37.237 --> 52:41.651
Saewoon apartments in eung-am.
Building 7, room 407.

52:46.705 --> 52:51.074
Actually, I'm not doing so well
within life in a bigger prison.

53:09.770 --> 53:11.180
Evergreen.

53:13.107 --> 53:14.688
"Who are you?"

53:18.946 --> 53:21.062
You meant to ask this, right?

53:22.199 --> 53:25.032
Bad boy,
you must find out on your own.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.446
Come on, it's a game.

53:27.579 --> 53:30.912
First, who? Then, why?

53:31.875 --> 53:34.241
If you figure it out,
come and see me anytime.

53:34.378 --> 53:36.039
I'll raise your score.

53:36.171 --> 53:38.127
You have until July 5th.

53:40.217 --> 53:42.549
Oh, no, only five days left.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.632
Too short?

53:47.599 --> 53:49.089
Hang in there.

53:49.226 --> 53:52.389
If you succeed,
I'll kill myself and not mi-do.

53:54.773 --> 53:56.934
That's right, mi-do.

53:57.943 --> 54:02.687
I'm going to kill every woman you love
until you die.

54:04.491 --> 54:07.733
Well, you're notorious for not protecting
your women anyway.

54:15.335 --> 54:18.702
Wow, you're strong, mr monster.

54:19.548 --> 54:22.255
Yes, you are the very monster
I've created.

54:24.428 --> 54:29.297
But you won't find out the "why"
if you do this.

54:29.433 --> 54:32.220
Fifteen years of being curious
would go to waste.

54:32.352 --> 54:34.183
Is that okay with you?

54:43.739 --> 54:45.354
Sit down there.

54:52.372 --> 54:54.954
Oh, the famous teeth torture.

54:56.376 --> 54:58.207
You won't have enough time for it.

54:59.254 --> 55:02.166
I have a pacemaker in my chest
for my weak heart.

55:03.175 --> 55:05.166
When it was put in,

55:06.512 --> 55:08.969
know what I asked the doctor?

55:12.059 --> 55:19.272
"Doctor Hopkins, give me a remote control
to turn that motor off."

55:19.399 --> 55:21.981
"Pardon? Why?"

55:24.571 --> 55:28.860
So that I can kill myself easily
any time.

55:29.827 --> 55:32.239
I'll give you $100,000 more.

55:46.260 --> 55:49.297
Oh, what will you do?

55:49.429 --> 55:52.136
You want to kill me right away,

55:52.266 --> 55:55.008
but you won't know
why you were imprisoned.

55:56.228 --> 55:59.641
You want to torture me,
but I say I'll kill myself first.

56:00.482 --> 56:05.727
So, do you seek revenge,
or do you find the truth?

56:07.865 --> 56:10.572
Oh, you're in a tough spot!

56:11.118 --> 56:14.451
I've been watching over you
for 15 years.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.663
I fared well, thanks to you.

56:18.792 --> 56:22.250
I wasn't bored or lonely.

56:25.048 --> 56:28.632
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for someone who got hurt.

56:29.177 --> 56:30.633
Try it.

56:32.139 --> 56:34.380
The loss of 15 years,

56:35.058 --> 56:37.140
the pain of losing your wife and child,

56:37.978 --> 56:40.310
you can forget all this.

56:40.856 --> 56:45.020
Once again, revenge is good
for your health.

56:45.152 --> 56:46.517
But...

56:47.779 --> 56:50.486
What happens
after you've revenged yourself?

56:51.575 --> 56:55.568
I bet that hidden pain
will probably find you again.

56:58.498 --> 57:00.409
Are you there, dae-su?

57:02.377 --> 57:03.833
Oh dae-su.

57:04.588 --> 57:06.203
Long time no see.

57:15.015 --> 57:19.008
Hasn't she been tied up too long?
You also left the door open.

57:32.658 --> 57:34.023
Please save me.

57:36.411 --> 57:38.197
But I could die first.

57:48.173 --> 57:49.913
This dentist is really good.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.132
Don't move.

58:01.395 --> 58:02.555
Don't move.

58:03.563 --> 58:04.643
Here we go.

58:33.885 --> 58:35.295
You see...

58:36.763 --> 58:42.303
They say that people shrivel up
because they have an imagination.

58:43.270 --> 58:46.228
So don't imagine.

58:47.441 --> 58:49.898
You'll become brave as hell.

58:50.610 --> 58:52.191
Now, here comes the real thing.
Yes?

59:22.225 --> 59:23.635
Yeah?

59:24.561 --> 59:29.055
You know I'm glad
you told me about this place,

59:30.484 --> 59:32.850
but I haven't even started.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.367
Let's go.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.848
Let's really go.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.390
Let's fight.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.024
Let's fight.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.857
What a roughneck.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.403
Your hand...

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:26.578
I'm gonna chop off your hand.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:30.582
You touched mi-do's breasts.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.707
Then what about my tongue?

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:57.021
You still don't trust me,
you rotten bastard?

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.944
It looks hard to accomplish.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:07.786
I looked into it, and the reason
the bank refused to pay $270 million...

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:10.496
Was not due
to any building irregularities.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:12.365
They're having internal problems.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.998
So I don't think we'll have any problems.

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:21.420
Of course,
chairman choi is special to us,

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:25.466
and his equity share is at 25 percent...

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.145
Dae-suu...

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:36.974
Yeah.

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:42.942
Did he really say that he'll kill me?

01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:46.733
Yeah.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.737
Because you love me?

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.462
Dae-suu...

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.000
What?

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:04.505
The face I miss

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:09.131
my heart is only getting lonelier

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:15.145
the words you send
with your eyes

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:18.978
I can feel with my hand

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:25.398
so many nights have passed

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:30.035
my heart is going to you

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:35.165
as I shed my sad tears

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:39.669
you're the face I miss

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:49.050
They packed their stuff
and left in a rental car.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:55.469
Also, mi-do called the restaurant
and quit her job.

01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:01.183
Let's go after this is done.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.858
You should get some rest today.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.908
I can't even sleep.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.409
Since I am forlorn.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:14.491
Mr han.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:17.873
Do you really think...

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:22.045
_mi-do has fallen in love with dae-su?

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:25.419
Already?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.062
Dae-su!

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.905
It really hurts.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.368
But I'm enduring it.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:56.370
You must know this!

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.930
How'd you hold out? For 15 years?

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.470
There's always a way.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.177
Do you like it?

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.597
You really like it, right?

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:25.938
I want to be good to you.

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:56.389
Don't worry about the future.

01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.135
Don't imagine anything.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:14.403
I feel like giving thanks
for all those years in that prison.

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:21.248
If I hadn't been in there,
could mi-do have liked me still?

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:02.432
He could only know that I wanted
to chop off mr park's hand

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.101
by putting a bug on us.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.472
And he knew our whereabouts
by tailing us.

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.519
I've been bugged.
Please find it.

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:14.736
You know, maybe he freed you

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:19.699
because he has fun watching you
run wild seeking revenge.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:25.076
And he'll never tell you why,
so he can toy with you forever.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.124
You think that's why?

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:33.121
Evergreen press,
an online printing system.

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:35.670
Evergreen pasta and pizza.

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:38.168
Evergreen services,
for security, parking, cleaning.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:39.794
Evergreen tree garden.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:44.345
Evergreen old boys,
sangnok high school alumni homepage.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:48.345
Evergreen secret diary,
jung sang-rok's personal site.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.472
Norwegian wood, evergreen...

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.522
Welcome to evergreen old boys

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.866
sangnok high school
alumni homepage

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.050
But it's time to close up.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:23.796
Can't I look at the records
for the class of '79?

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.437
It's dark, so turn on the lights.

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.318
Take your time.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.403
Lee woo-Jin

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.734
joo-hwan?
Let me ask you something.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.787
Do you know Lee woo-Jin
of the class of '797?

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:50.622
I think he went to America to study.

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:57.046
Don't know him.
So is that the bastard's hame?

01:08:57.175 --> 01:09:01.669
- How'd you find out?
- I looked through all the school albums.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:06.764
I don't know just with a name.
Got anything else?

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:09.850
Why don't you look
for the school records?

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.937
Do you know Lee soo-ah?
She was in our grade.

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:16.604
Soo-ah? She died.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:19.819
- What class was she in?
- Class two, I think.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:24.611
She was in my class. Next to yours.
So what about her?

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.327
Why is there no photo?

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.948
Ah, she died, that's why.

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:35.705
How did Lee soo-ah die?

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:40.081
Yeah, you wouldn't know.
She died after you transferred.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:45.921
She went alone to the habchun dam,
and fell into the river.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:49.094
She croaked like a dead fish.

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:57.058
A week later, they found
her bloated body in the water.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:59.730
- What was she like?
- Her?

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.944
She was a total slut.

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:05.736
On the outside,
she acted like a prude,

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.281
but she was a filthy whore
on the inside.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:14.283
Rumour had it that
that slut fucked everyone at school.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:18.124
I should've got a piece of her.

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:25.135
I also heard that
her family was really rich.

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:27.254
Her grades were good, too.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:31.804
But the bad thing was
that she was a slut.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.769
Wow, this is such an old story.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:38.606
Dae-su, I don't remember
since it was so long ago,

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.691
but that soo-ah, you see...

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:58.118
Joo-hwan, what's happened?

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.539
Joo-hwan, is something wrong?

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:09.966
Oh dae-su...

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.926
My sister...

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.096
Wasn't a slut.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:21.982
You must accept this.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:28.857
Since you got rid of your bug,
I had to come all the way here.

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.109
To eavesdrop.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.112
So that's why joo-hwan...

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.949
Died because of you.

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:59.475
You bastard, I'm going to kill you!

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.409
You son of a bitch!

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:45.938
We're not open yet.
Please come back in an hour.

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:50.234
Someone who got six gold teeth
recommended this place.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.448
Mr park?

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.626
I had to move because of you.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:05.791
In commemoration,

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.336
I installed a new TV.

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:11.675
Do you like it?

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.630
There are so many channels.
Great, huh?

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:18.716
Some prisoners even prefer to stay here.

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:22.391
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years?

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:25.644
It felt like home after 11 years.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:29.898
Come on, I don't need money.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.030
An enemy's enemy is a friend.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:41.076
We threw away the hand
because it rotted.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.039
Honey, I missed you.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:47.624
Rotten bastard. You'll pay for this.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.259
So why'd you bring me here?

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:03.102
If I don't return after July 5th,
then let her go.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:11.895
While I was locked up here,
I remember someone visiting me.

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:14.564
What did that person do?

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.236
Was it three times?

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:20.988
I put a hypnosis-inducing drug
in your water.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.863
Sodium barbiturate?

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:25.616
TV man knows it all.

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:39.547
Scissorhands hair salon

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:48.931
That's nonsense.

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:50.979
Even though it was a catholic school,

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:54.486
she wouldn't die
just because of those rumours.

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:56.731
There's probably another reason.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:15:01.862
Could she have been pregnant maybe?

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:07.534
I really don't think
soo-ah was like that.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.002
She was such a pure girl.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:12.838
I know she didn't put out for anyone.

01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:18.507
But she did go out
with someone back then.

01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:23.299
So who was that guy?

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:26.302
I have no idea.

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:41.317
Choon-shim?

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.947
You knew Lee soo-ah, right?
Who was her boyfriend?

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.619
Don't know?

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:50.993
You damn wench!

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:55.123
How would you know when
you don't care a bit about friendship?

01:15:55.259 --> 01:15:58.251
Shut up. Then who'd know?

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.012
Who? Joo-hwan?

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:07.267
What?

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:11.556
Yeah, I know him.

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.558
But how'd he know?

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:16.769
Yeah?

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.821
Really?

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.112
Okay, hang up.
I'll call you in a bit.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:29.782
Choon-shim said...

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:33.661
That she heard it from joo-hwan.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.921
And that you'd know the best.

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:54.015
Ring, ring

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.941
move aside

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.442
you'll get hurt

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.947
if you get in the way

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.423
Oh dae-su

01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:38.188
You little misfit.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:39.860
Put it out!

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:43.857
I'm transferring today. To Seoul.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.906
So get lost, miss Kim.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.112
You good-for-nothing!

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:48.887
You're oh dae-su, right?

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.842
And you're miss...

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:55.811
I heard you're popular
among the girls.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:59.560
You know how rumours are.

01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:03.106
I heard you're really funny.
Say something.

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:09.450
Me being so popular
is such a big hassle.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:24.624
There's this father and son.
They went to the public bath, and...

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.671
See you later.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:51.700
Take care, fuckheads!

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:53.879
- Come on.
- Wait.

01:20:56.602 --> 01:20:58.968
- Come here.
- No.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:04.519
- Hurry and come here.
- Okay, okay.

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:15.401
Satisfied?

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.619
- Lift this up.
- Come on.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.579
- Lift it!
- No.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.846
What?

01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:45.477
It tickles.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.136
Give them here.

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:24.561
- What are you doing?
- Let me see.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.521
What are you doing?

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:29.141
- Let me see.
- Stop!

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.195
Go away.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.092
Was it really soo-ah? Are you sure?

01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:28.389
I don't know her name.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:32.731
I just know that she's in your class,
and she rides a red bike.

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:43.238
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul if I go.

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:46.783
- Where are you going?
- Going on a date with choon-shim.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.870
I'll kill you if you shoot your mouth off!

01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:56.755
No way.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:01.801
You got locked up for 15 years
just for saying that?

01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:06.931
Was that such a big crime?

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:14.315
Be it a grain of sand or a rock,
in water they sink as the same.

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:19.895
That's what Lee woo-Jin believes.

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:25.492
Then... what does July 5th stand for?

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.616
That's the day...

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:34.038
Lee soo-ah died.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:40.920
Now it's over.

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:45.387
Instead of seeking revenge,
you wanted to find out the why, right?

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:52.015
Now we'll run away where
woo-+jin can never find us, right?

01:25:55.776 --> 01:26:01.237
I can't end it like this.
Seeking revenge has become a part of me.

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:09.236
But you don't even know
where he lives.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:14.040
"Like a gazelle
from the hand of the hunter...

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:17.252
"Like a bird
from the snare of the Fowler...

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:18.712
"Free yourself."

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:24.380
It's a phrase from jamon 6, verse 4.
And "jamon" in english is Maxim.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:29.007
And evergreen said
he lives in a high tower.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:34.887
So... six and four must just be floors.

01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:37.684
Fourth floor.

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:40.104
Sixth floor.

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:42.401
Or the sixty-fourth floor?

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:48.150
P? Penthouse!

01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:54.205
Please insert the code.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:03.503
What would you like me to pray for?

01:27:05.846 --> 01:27:10.055
Wrong entry.
Please insert again.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:18.643
Wrong entry.
Please insert again.

01:27:18.775 --> 01:27:20.561
Dear lord,

01:27:22.195 --> 01:27:24.902
please let me

01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:27.613
meet a younger man next time.

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:19.867
Please make woo-Jin...

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:22.661
Bow to dae-su,

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:27.416
and make him beg for forgiveness.

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:42.807
You slept with your sister.

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:55.911
Let's go up and talk.

01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:20.518
Grab him!

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:45.126
Try to be nice.

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:17.617
Feels great.

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:21.409
You slept with your sister.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.497
I feel so refreshed.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:31.839
And I started the rumour.

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:35.085
That's why your sister died.

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:46.935
Looking through the mirror
reminds me of that day. Doesn't it?

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:51.527
Erasing my memory and telling me
to find the truth was unfair.

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:54.820
I won.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.651
So die like you promised.

01:30:58.787 --> 01:31:02.325
Think you forgot that day
because you were hypnotised?

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:06.245
Are you sure?

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:09.586
Know the real reason
why you can't remember?

01:31:18.264 --> 01:31:20.346
You just forgot.

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:23.182
Is that too bland?

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:26.519
But it's true that you just forgot.

01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:28.980
Why?
Since it's not your business.

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:36.022
Your rumour got so out of hand that
soo-ah being pregnant became a rumour.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:40.696
My sister got sucked into that rumour,
and began believing it.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:45.744
So her period stopped,
and her belly began to swell.

01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:47.615
Funny, isn't it?

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:51.586
Ever thought how a girl would feel
bearing both her child and nephew?

01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:53.296
Understand now?

01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:58.627
Your tongue got my sister pregnant.

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:02.839
It wasn't Lee woo-Jin's dick.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.559
It was oh dae-su's tongue.

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:13.725
Is that why you killed your sister?

01:32:13.862 --> 01:32:18.276
Ever thought how a boy would feel
impregnating a child and sister?

01:32:22.495 --> 01:32:24.031
You were probably afraid.

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:28.282
Afraid that everyone will know
once the baby's born.

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:32.912
When you realised that
she imagined it after you killed her,

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:38.800
you hating me...
Is understandable.

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:47.305
They said soo-ah died alone
at the dam,

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:49.428
but who took this photo?

01:32:50.732 --> 01:32:53.269
And what about the date,
July 5th?

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:02.611
This is no fun.

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:06.243
I'll just finish what I was saying.

01:33:06.372 --> 01:33:09.330
Listen carefully.
My story is really fun.

01:33:09.459 --> 01:33:12.121
Ever heard of post-hypnotic suggestion?

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.585
You suggest something
during hypnosis,

01:33:14.714 --> 01:33:16.955
and then it's acted out
in your wakened state.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:20.834
Still haven't figured it out?

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:30.644
"You lead a stranger to your place.
Who the hell are you?"

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:33.764
What about you, you rotten bastard?

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:40.895
We hypnotised both of you.

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:46.068
One very fortunate thing was
that compared to others

01:33:46.204 --> 01:33:48.616
both of you were highly receptive
to hypnosis.

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:51.573
Isn't this fun?

01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:56.248
One word gets you pregnant.
One word gets you in love.

01:33:58.925 --> 01:34:03.168
But no matter how receptive
the two of you are to hypnosis,

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:06.592
and no matter how good
of a hypnotist ms yoo is,

01:34:06.724 --> 01:34:10.012
getting people to fall in love
isn't easy.

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:13.636
So, know how we did it?

01:34:16.943 --> 01:34:20.982
Your first suggestion, of course,
was to go to that restaurant

01:34:21.114 --> 01:34:23.480
right after your release.

01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:29.031
Next, to react
to the mobile phone's melody.

01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:33.824
When you heard this,
you were to say something.

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:37.122
Who are you?

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:41.206
Do you... like your clothes?

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:47.884
And mi-do was to react to the man
who said this.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:52.134
When she grabs your hand,
your reaction would be, of course...

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:58.940
Your gravest mistake
wasn't failing to find the answer.

01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:05.443
If you keep asking the wrong questions,
you'll never find the right answer.

01:35:05.575 --> 01:35:10.194
It's not,
"why did woo-Jin imprison me?"

01:35:10.330 --> 01:35:13.367
It's "why did he release me?"

01:35:13.499 --> 01:35:15.035
Once again,

01:35:16.336 --> 01:35:22.878
why did woo-Jin release
dae-su after... 15 years?

01:37:25.298 --> 01:37:27.254
Laugh, and the world
laughs with you.

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:29.123
Weep, and you will weep alone.

01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:11.605
Mr han.

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:13.208
Mi-do doesn't know, right?

01:40:17.261 --> 01:40:20.048
Why'd you hide her there?

01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:24.682
You thought he'd hate me
because I cut off his hand?

01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:28.018
Couldn't you figure out
that it was a trap?

01:40:29.607 --> 01:40:33.191
How can you protect your woman
with that brain of yours?

01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:38.276
I've been secretly raising mi-do
since she was three.

01:40:39.450 --> 01:40:41.611
What's wrong with you?

01:40:42.662 --> 01:40:44.778
And mr park's hand?

01:40:45.998 --> 01:40:48.034
You moron.

01:40:48.167 --> 01:40:52.911
Seen his new prison?
I got him that building for his hand!

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:54.378
Me!

01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:20.563
Dae-su!

01:41:22.326 --> 01:41:26.114
Right in front of me,
there's some type of box.

01:41:26.247 --> 01:41:28.488
It's that same Violet box.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.865
He's telling me to open it.

01:41:31.002 --> 01:41:32.742
No!

01:41:32.878 --> 01:41:37.622
No, mi-do, don't.
Don't open it no matter what.

01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:40.249
If you do,
something terrible will happen.

01:41:40.386 --> 01:41:43.549
What's in it?
You know, don't you?

01:41:43.681 --> 01:41:48.300
Mi-do, my sweet pea,
wait a little longer. I'll be there.

01:41:48.436 --> 01:41:52.224
I'll be there very soon.

01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:56.520
Can't you come right now?

01:41:58.195 --> 01:42:00.186
I'm scared.

01:42:00.323 --> 01:42:02.314
My sweet pea, you can wait, right?

01:42:04.493 --> 01:42:06.859
Very good. Good girl.

01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:11.948
I'll call you back very soon, okay?

01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:35.104
I beg you.
Please don't tell mi-do.

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:39.396
What has she done wrong?

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:44.606
You know it was all my fault.

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:49.027
I have...

01:42:50.581 --> 01:42:53.573
I have committed a terrible sin

01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:55.449
to your sister.

01:42:57.338 --> 01:42:59.579
And I was...

01:43:00.716 --> 01:43:03.048
Very wrong to you also.

01:43:04.053 --> 01:43:09.389
So... please leave mi-do alone, okay?

01:43:14.730 --> 01:43:17.312
By any chance,

01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:20.183
if mi-do finds out the truth,

01:43:20.319 --> 01:43:24.232
you arsehole,

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:27.277
I'll rip your whole body apart,

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:32.029
and no one will be able
to find your body anywhere.

01:43:32.164 --> 01:43:33.574
Why?

01:43:33.708 --> 01:43:36.541
Because I'm going
to chew it all down.

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:40.289
Woo-Jin!

01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:43.376
Woo-Jin, I made a mistake.

01:43:43.509 --> 01:43:46.626
Please forget what I said.

01:43:46.762 --> 01:43:48.923
Sir! Boss!

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:50.421
Woo-Jin!

01:43:50.558 --> 01:43:55.518
Woo-Jin, we're evergreen old boys,
remember?

01:43:55.646 --> 01:44:01.733
With the energy
from a green pine tree

01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:09.024
the great sangnok high...

01:44:11.871 --> 01:44:15.238
I'll do whatever you want.

01:44:15.374 --> 01:44:17.990
I'll do anything. I beg you.

01:44:18.127 --> 01:44:23.338
Woo-Jin, if you want me
to be a dog, I will!

01:44:23.466 --> 01:44:27.209
I'm woo-Jin's dog from now on!

01:44:27.344 --> 01:44:29.630
I'm your puppy!

01:44:34.268 --> 01:44:37.351
Look, I'm wagging my tail.

01:44:38.522 --> 01:44:40.979
I'm a dog.
I'll guard the house well.

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:43.645
I'll be your slave dog.

01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:53.024
The box...

01:46:58.412 --> 01:47:00.619
Just leave it closed.

01:47:10.883 --> 01:47:12.589
Now...

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:17.632
What joy will I live for?

01:48:19.868 --> 01:48:21.608
Dae-su.

01:48:21.745 --> 01:48:23.610
It really hurts.

01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:26.447
But I'm enduring it.

01:48:31.005 --> 01:48:33.087
You must know this.

01:48:52.818 --> 01:48:57.528
My sister and I loved each other
despite knowing everything.

01:49:00.534 --> 01:49:02.820
Can you two do the same?

01:49:46.038 --> 01:49:47.824
Soo0-ah.

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:04.049
Woo-Jin...

01:50:05.724 --> 01:50:08.090
I know you've been scared.

01:50:10.521 --> 01:50:13.638
So let go of me, okay?

01:50:30.124 --> 01:50:33.491
Remember me, okay?

01:50:41.552 --> 01:50:44.464
I have no regrets. Do you?

01:51:29.933 --> 01:51:33.721
This is the whole adventure
I went through until now.

01:51:33.854 --> 01:51:37.597
Thank you for listening
to a terrible story till the end.

01:51:38.275 --> 01:51:39.731
Sending a letter

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:43.978
instead of talking to you in person,
I trust that you will understand.

01:51:44.114 --> 01:51:48.232
The reason is that I have no tongue.

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:51.485
To be honest,
I have no reason to help you.

01:51:57.002 --> 01:51:58.913
But there was one thing.

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.622
I was touched by this last sentence.

01:52:04.259 --> 01:52:08.878
Even though I'm no worse
than a beast,

01:52:09.014 --> 01:52:13.599
don't I have the right to live?

01:52:16.313 --> 01:52:19.805
The hypnosis could go wrong,
and distort your memories.

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.392
Will that be okay?

01:52:43.799 --> 01:52:45.835
If you're ready,

01:52:47.636 --> 01:52:49.718
stare at that tree.

01:53:06.488 --> 01:53:12.028
The tree is slowly changing
into a concrete column.

01:53:20.502 --> 01:53:24.461
You're now inside
woo-Jin's penthouse.

01:53:25.507 --> 01:53:27.498
It's a dreary night.

01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:35.510
The sound of your footsteps
to the window permeates the room.

01:53:49.364 --> 01:53:53.232
When I ring my bell,

01:53:54.244 --> 01:53:57.452
you'll be split into two people.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:04.918
The one who doesn't know
the secret is oh dae-su.

01:54:06.131 --> 01:54:09.123
The one who keeps the secret
is the monster.

01:54:10.427 --> 01:54:12.258
When I ring the bell again,

01:54:12.387 --> 01:54:15.720
the monster will turn around
and begin walking.

01:54:20.812 --> 01:54:24.976
With each step, you age one year.

01:54:25.108 --> 01:54:29.226
When the monster reaches seventy,
he will die.

01:54:30.238 --> 01:54:32.524
There's no need to worry.

01:54:32.657 --> 01:54:36.366
It will be a very peaceful death.

01:54:43.168 --> 01:54:45.375
Now, good luck to you.

01:55:27.295 --> 01:55:29.035
What's wrong?

01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:32.205
Look at you.

01:56:01.121 --> 01:56:03.237
Were you with somebody?

01:56:58.970 --> 01:57:02.633
I love you... dae-su.
