03:04.434 --> 03:05.477
ISAAC: <i>Yes.</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:07.270
Okay, let me rephrase.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.731
We want to run a ship-wide
systems check for the refit.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.441
Means a temporary shutdown.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.526
<i>Do you have a durational estimate?</i>

Half hour? Sorry to kick you
out of your your lab.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.114
<i>This facility is here for the use</i>

03:18.198 --> 03:20.367
<i>of all science and engineering personnel.</i>

03:20.450 --> 03:21.493
No, I know.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.660
We just all feel like

03:22.869 --> 03:25.080
you sort of look at this
as like your quarters.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.539
Anyway, I'll try to make it quick.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.291
Why don't you, uh, get a
drink or something?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.793
<i>I do not drink.</i>

03:30.126 --> 03:31.211
It was a joke.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.004
<i>Ha, ha.</i>

03:33.088 --> 03:34.255
<i>Ha.</i>

03:34.339 --> 03:35.507
What?

03:35.674 --> 03:38.343

<i>correct response to a joke?</i>

03:38.426 --> 03:40.345

04:14.963 --> 04:16.423
<i>May I join you?</i>

04:20.218 --> 04:21.219
Sure.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.534
Hey.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.787
Sorry, that was a little harsh.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.915
<i>I have noticed the tendency of</i>
<i>crew members in the mess hall</i>

04:50.999 --> 04:52.584
<i>to relocate when I approach.</i>

04:52.667 --> 04:55.295
Yeah. I think they're all just
still getting used to the idea

04:55.378 --> 04:56.838
that you're staying on board.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.631
<i>A reasonable assessment.</i>

04:58.840 --> 04:59.883
Pancakes?

05:00.091 --> 05:01.885
<i>I do not consume food.</i>

05:01.968 --> 05:03.928
Ah. Right. Of course.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.722
Me, I can't get enough of these things.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.599
Favorite food since I was a kid.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.934
I'd eat 'em every meal if
I could. Just butter, though.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.770
No syrup, no fruit.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.814
People think that's kinda weird.

05:16.691 --> 05:20.987
Does it... feel bad at all
when people avoid you?

05:21.071 --> 05:24.324
<i>The behavioral pattern</i>
<i>is fascinating to observe,</i>

05:24.407 --> 05:27.285
<i>but the emotional response</i>
<i>is beyond my capability.</i>

05:27.369 --> 05:28.620
That's a shame.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.539
<i>Indeed. It would be most informative.</i>

05:31.623 --> 05:34.292
You were deactivated
during the battle, weren't you?

05:34.376 --> 05:35.418
<i>Yes.</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:38.463
I'm sure people have told you about it.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.548
<i>I have processed all available information</i>

05:40.632 --> 05:42.092
<i>from the ship's database,</i>

05:42.175 --> 05:44.552
<i>including a strategic timeline</i>
<i>of the event.</i>

05:45.470 --> 05:46.846
"The event"?

05:48.807 --> 05:50.642
I'll tell you a story anyway.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.853
I was on the USS Quimby.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.730
<i>The Quimby was destroyed.</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:57.023
Yeah.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.027
I was with our junior astrometrics officer

06:01.111 --> 06:02.362
at the time.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.240
She was helping me with an emergency reset

06:05.323 --> 06:06.950
of the navigational computer.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.120
She was an amazing woman.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.206
Really great at her job.

06:14.457 --> 06:18.211
And she also happened to be
my best friend.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.215
Her name was Amanda.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.261
When we got the order to abandon ship,

06:26.344 --> 06:28.179
we made for the nearest escape pod.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.181
(grunts and screams)

06:30.432 --> 06:32.475
(dramatic music playing)

06:37.105 --> 06:38.773
(beeping)

06:49.367 --> 06:51.786
We strapped in, but when we
initiated the launch,

06:51.870 --> 06:52.996
nothing happened.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.290
(loud rumbling)

06:55.373 --> 06:56.708
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.835
The sequencing mechanism is jammed.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.298
We knew one of us was gonna
have to launch manually.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.633
-I'll go.
-No, Charly, I will do it!

07:05.717 --> 07:07.344
-No, I wanna, I wanna go!
-I will do it, Charly!

07:07.427 --> 07:08.803
-No! Listen to me!
-No, I don't want you--

07:08.887 --> 07:10.513
Goddamn it, Charly, listen to me!

07:10.597 --> 07:11.931
It's okay!

07:13.183 --> 07:14.642
It's okay.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.562
(muffled explosions)

07:17.645 --> 07:18.521
(exhales sharply)

07:22.901 --> 07:24.903
CHARLY: <i>The look in her eyes.</i>

07:25.153 --> 07:26.571
There was no argument.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.620
(rumbling)

07:34.204 --> 07:35.497
(beeping)

07:35.580 --> 07:37.749
(alarm sounding)

07:38.500 --> 07:40.001
(explosion)

07:42.796 --> 07:44.297
(hydraulics hiss)

07:56.685 --> 07:58.269
One second she was there...

07:59.354 --> 08:01.106
and the next, she was gone.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.609
Along with 300 other people.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.486
Because of you.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.906
So, you see,

08:10.031 --> 08:14.994
it really is a shame
that you can't feel anything.

08:15.870 --> 08:19.207
Because you deserve to feel
all the pain in the universe.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.376
And, if I were you,

08:21.710 --> 08:23.753
I'd stay the hell out of the mess hall.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.298
It makes people sick to look at you.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.872
(doors hiss)

09:20.769 --> 09:23.605
(epic theme playing)

10:56.906 --> 10:59.284
(expansive orchestral music playing)

11:20.764 --> 11:23.350
Have they recalibrated the
forward navigational scanners?

11:23.433 --> 11:25.602
No, but Commander Lamarr said
that's next on the list.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.228
I hope he's taken at least one night off

11:27.312 --> 11:28.605
in the last three weeks.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.317
Gordon, why don't you take him
out tonight, get him wasted?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.861
-Is that an order, sir?
-It is.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.488
I enjoy this job, sir.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.698
TALLA: (over comm) <i>Keyali to Captain.</i>

11:38.990 --> 11:40.158
Go ahead.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.451
TALLA: <i>Can you and Commander Grayson</i>

11:41.534 --> 11:42.994
<i>come to the astrophysics lab?</i>

11:43.161 --> 11:45.580
<i>There's... something you need to see.</i>

11:46.122 --> 11:47.457
We're on our way.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.260
-Who did this?
-We don't know.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.262
Whoever it was did a DNA scrub.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.264
Usually the case
in these kinds of incidents.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.350
Who's been in here in the past few hours?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.727
ISAAC: <i>To my knowledge,</i>
<i>only Commander Lamarr.</i>

12:07.811 --> 12:10.522
I think we can rule that one
out. Anyone else?

12:10.605 --> 12:11.690
Everything was shut down

12:11.773 --> 12:13.233
while John was running his systems check.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.651
So, there's no way to tell.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.778
-What about the paint?
-TALLA: We checked the logs.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.614
Whoever replicated it used a
mid-level systems access code,

12:19.698 --> 12:20.865
but there's no ID.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.283
We think it was stolen.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.327
-Talla, how the hell--
-I have no idea how,

12:24.411 --> 12:25.870
but I've reissued all-new access codes

12:25.954 --> 12:27.080
to everyone with clearance,

12:27.288 --> 12:29.207
and I'm investigating
the source of the leak.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.292
I'm sorry, sir, this is on me.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.795
-Just get it fixed, okay?
-I will.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.172
But, sir, there's something else
I think I should tell you.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.799
What?

12:40.010 --> 12:42.220
I was in the mess hall earlier and...

12:42.303 --> 12:43.430
there was an incident.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.889
What do you mean?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.641
TALLA: Isaac came in, sat down,

12:46.725 --> 12:49.060
and every crewman
at the table got up and left.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.062
The only one who stayed was Ensign Burke.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.148
And she said
some pretty rough things to him.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.151
-Like what?
-Like he deserved to feel pain.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.070
And he should stay out of the mess hall.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.363
Isaac, is this true?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.115
ISAAC: <i>Yes, Commander.</i>

13:02.198 --> 13:04.492
<i>It is a frequent occurrence</i>
<i>during my interactions</i>

13:04.576 --> 13:05.785
<i>with other crew members.</i>

13:05.869 --> 13:08.288
Frequent? For how long?

13:08.371 --> 13:10.248
<i>Ever since I was reinstated.</i>

13:10.331 --> 13:11.708
You've been getting harassed by the crew,

13:11.791 --> 13:12.834
and you haven't said anything?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.502
<i>I would remind you, Commander,</i>

13:14.586 --> 13:16.212
<i>that I am incapable of being hurt</i>

13:16.296 --> 13:18.089
<i>by such hostile interactions.</i>

13:18.173 --> 13:20.550
<i>In fact, it has provided me</i>
<i>with an opportunity</i>

13:20.633 --> 13:23.386
<i>to observe an intriguing facet</i>
<i>of human comportment</i>

13:23.470 --> 13:25.430
<i>I have not previously encountered.</i>

13:26.431 --> 13:28.600
-Hatred.
-ISAAC: <i>Correct, sir.</i>

13:28.683 --> 13:31.686
<i>The behavioral data</i>
<i>has been quite plentiful.</i>

13:31.770 --> 13:32.645
(sighs)

13:34.898 --> 13:37.859
Ensign Burke. Please report to my office.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.779
Captain, I understand how this looks,

13:40.862 --> 13:43.490
but I swear to you on my honor,
I did not write that.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.492
Do you have any idea who did?

13:45.575 --> 13:48.745
No. I haven't been in the lab
since the refit began.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.288
You have to believe me.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.791
Well, you're a Union officer
who's given us your word.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.125
I believe you.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.170
But, I'm very concerned
about what I heard from Talla.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.342
Look, the subject of Isaac
is obviously complex.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.261
But, what she described
needs to be addressed.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.223
Permission to speak freely, sir?

14:08.306 --> 14:09.599
Granted.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.267
You have a big problem.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.229
Go on.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.647
A whole lot of people aboard this ship

14:15.730 --> 14:18.316
are still angry that you reinstated Isaac.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.068
And, I mean angry.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.569
I'm aware of that.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.363
And, just about every member of this crew

14:23.446 --> 14:24.698
knows at least one person who died

14:24.781 --> 14:25.949
in the battle with the Kaylon.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.909
And the number's usually higher.

14:28.034 --> 14:32.122
Friends, colleagues, family...

14:32.205 --> 14:34.207
And the fact that he just
sits on that bridge

14:34.290 --> 14:36.084
every single day as if nothing happened,

14:36.167 --> 14:38.294
is a kick in the teeth to
every single one of them.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.422
You don't think
he should've been reactivated?

14:40.505 --> 14:42.340
No. I don't.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.259
Even though he was also
the one who saved us.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.969
Too little, too late.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.471
And on top of that, how do you
know he isn't carrying

14:48.555 --> 14:50.724
some sleeper program
just waiting to fire up,

14:50.807 --> 14:51.933
and take over the ship?

14:53.184 --> 14:55.228
People are scared, Captain.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.981
Your crew is scared.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.695
It's heresy for a captain
to admit something like this,

15:03.778 --> 15:05.613
but I don't know that you're wrong.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.323
I made this decision,

15:07.407 --> 15:09.367
and I'm still not sure
it was the right one.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.328
But, regardless of the ethical question,

15:12.412 --> 15:14.873
there's a more pragmatic reason
that Isaac is still onboard.

15:14.956 --> 15:18.168
We barely fought off the Kaylon
without losing our entire fleet.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.003
Next time, we might not be so lucky.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.340
Isaac is the only person who
might be able to help us devise

15:23.423 --> 15:26.468
a potent enough defense that
we can all feel secure again.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.678
And, we'll have him to thank
for that security?

15:29.804 --> 15:31.389
Will it be worth it?

15:36.227 --> 15:37.228
Dismissed.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.654
I think I better start working
up a plan to improve morale.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.864
How?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.074
No clue.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.658
I'll organize a talent show if I have to,

15:50.742 --> 15:52.327
but we gotta nip this in the bud.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.703
(deep sigh)

15:55.497 --> 15:57.540
(dramatic music playing)

16:13.515 --> 16:15.392
(electronic chittering)

with a heavy cruiser.

31:28.221 --> 31:29.681
TALLA: (over comm) <i>Keyali to Captain.</i>

31:29.764 --> 31:30.932
Go ahead.

31:31.016 --> 31:32.684
TALLA: <i>We have an emergency.</i>

31:33.601 --> 31:36.021
ISAAC: <i>Optical resolution in simulator two</i>

31:36.104 --> 31:40.233
<i>can be increased by 63%</i>
<i>with orthogonal multiplexing.</i>

31:40.316 --> 31:43.528
<i>I offer my best wishes to the Finn family.</i>

31:45.613 --> 31:47.032
(chime sounds)

31:47.115 --> 31:48.450
How did this happen?

31:48.533 --> 31:50.994
This is an EM amplification module.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.996
What it looks like is that Isaac used it

31:53.079 --> 31:54.789
to force a narrow-band frequency spike

31:54.873 --> 31:56.166
in his central processor.

31:56.249 --> 31:57.459
Why?

31:57.542 --> 31:59.169
He was trying to shut it down.

31:59.252 --> 32:00.587
Shut down his own brain?

32:00.670 --> 32:04.257
And from what my
scans are showing, he succeeded.

32:04.341 --> 32:05.925
Why the hell would he do that?

32:06.009 --> 32:07.594
Captain...

32:09.471 --> 32:11.431
Isaac committed suicide.

32:11.890 --> 32:13.099
What?

32:13.266 --> 32:15.727
There's no other reason
to do something like this.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.354
Can you revive him?

32:17.437 --> 32:19.814
The scans are showing
complete systems failure,

32:19.898 --> 32:21.733
so I'm gonna have to take him
down to engineering.

32:22.067 --> 32:23.151
If there's even a chance,

32:23.234 --> 32:25.153
Yaphit's gonna have to get in there.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.117
(squelching)

32:42.837 --> 32:44.214
He's helped him before.

32:48.426 --> 32:49.969
What?

32:50.762 --> 32:52.180
When Isaac shut down before the battle,

32:52.263 --> 32:54.432
it was a generalized EM pulse.

32:54.516 --> 32:57.560
Packed a heavy punch, but it
was still just brute force.

32:57.644 --> 32:59.145
This is...

32:59.229 --> 33:00.897
Isaac was deliberate here.

33:00.980 --> 33:04.067
He targeted his primary systems
with precision.

33:04.234 --> 33:07.445
It's like puncturing a seal
with a nail instead of a hammer.

33:07.529 --> 33:10.782
It's not as heavy,
but the pressure's more focused.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.743
I had no idea things were this bad.

33:13.827 --> 33:15.745
How could he get to this place?

33:15.829 --> 33:17.205
With no emotions.

33:17.288 --> 33:19.416
I never believed that.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.752
We're seeing just how much he really felt.

33:23.503 --> 33:25.505
(squelching)

33:27.424 --> 33:28.717
CLAIRE: What happened?

33:28.800 --> 33:30.135
Can you help him?

33:30.760 --> 33:33.179
Claire, I'm... I'm sorry.

33:35.015 --> 33:36.599
I mean, he knew what he was doing.

33:36.683 --> 33:39.102
The pathways are all fried.

33:40.020 --> 33:41.438
Even if we could power him up,

33:41.521 --> 33:43.314
his internal memory is shot. He--

33:43.398 --> 33:44.858
He'd be an empty shell.

33:46.776 --> 33:48.028
He's gone.

34:03.335 --> 34:05.337
(contemplative music playing)

34:09.883 --> 34:11.885
(battle sound effects playing)

34:14.220 --> 34:15.347
(alert chimes)

34:26.066 --> 34:27.400
Marcus...?

34:30.737 --> 34:31.863
Honey?

34:35.408 --> 34:36.534
Look...

34:37.786 --> 34:39.496
I know that you're awake.

34:41.039 --> 34:42.082
I just...

34:42.957 --> 34:44.709
want to know if you want to talk.

34:45.627 --> 34:47.212
I'm really tired, Mom.

34:49.047 --> 34:50.340
Are you okay?

34:50.423 --> 34:51.591
Yeah.

34:58.431 --> 35:01.935
I just hope you understand
that Isaac made a choice.

35:02.686 --> 35:07.440
It was the wrong choice,
but it was his alone.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.861
-And it's important for--
-Mom.

35:12.696 --> 35:14.239
I'm really okay.

35:15.490 --> 35:16.741
Oh...

35:17.867 --> 35:19.035
All right.

36:01.786 --> 36:02.662
Hey.

36:15.008 --> 36:16.343
Did I ever tell you about the time

36:16.426 --> 36:17.969
I was on Dazheen Four?

36:18.470 --> 36:20.013
That was the big storm, wasn't it?

36:20.096 --> 36:21.598
Ionized dust.

36:22.974 --> 36:26.353
We'd lost all communication
with the shuttle for ten days,

36:26.436 --> 36:28.938
and we only had enough water for a week.

36:29.939 --> 36:31.524
When we finally ran out...

36:32.859 --> 36:37.238
we'd put a pebble in our mouths
to stimulate saliva.

36:38.073 --> 36:40.241
Just like travelers crossing the desert

36:40.325 --> 36:41.910
during the frontier days.

36:43.203 --> 36:44.454
A little pebble.

36:45.246 --> 36:48.667
To wake up the glands
and make them do their job.

36:50.377 --> 36:51.836
That's what I need now.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.005
A pebble?

36:55.382 --> 36:57.217
Not for a dry mouth.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.760
A dry mind.

37:00.970 --> 37:04.724
I've been banishing all thoughts
of Isaac for so long...

37:04.808 --> 37:07.477
to ignore the impossible reconciliation

37:07.560 --> 37:09.062
of who I knew him to be,

37:09.145 --> 37:11.648
and this terrible thing that he did,

37:11.731 --> 37:15.402
that now, when I need to feel something...

37:16.403 --> 37:17.696
I can't.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.781
(deep breath)

37:19.864 --> 37:21.866
I don't know how to wake up.

37:22.701 --> 37:25.829
Just because someone you love
does a bad thing,

37:26.413 --> 37:28.707
doesn't mean you automatically
stop loving them.

37:29.457 --> 37:30.542
It's not that simple.

37:30.625 --> 37:32.002
This crew.

37:32.085 --> 37:34.629
My kids. He nearly killed us all.

37:34.754 --> 37:35.839
But he didn't.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.091
He turned against
his own people to save us.

37:38.174 --> 37:40.093
After how many others had died?

37:42.137 --> 37:44.681
How could you love someone like that?

37:48.351 --> 37:49.436
Do you?

37:52.647 --> 37:54.315
Ed has a philosophy that the only way

37:54.399 --> 37:55.775
to recover from lost love,

37:55.859 --> 37:58.611
is to stay away from places
where you've been happy.

37:59.654 --> 38:01.823
Maybe you need to do the opposite.

38:01.990 --> 38:03.658
Visit those places.

38:04.659 --> 38:05.994
Find out what it is you're burying.

38:06.828 --> 38:10.248
And, what if I find out
that I still love him?

38:11.958 --> 38:13.793
What do I greet that with?

38:13.877 --> 38:16.796
Shame or acceptance?

38:16.880 --> 38:18.465
And, whichever it is,

38:18.548 --> 38:20.342
what am I supposed to do with it?

38:23.511 --> 38:24.846
Either way...

38:26.348 --> 38:27.724
I'm too late.

38:31.728 --> 38:36.483
I know that Isaac was not loved by all.

38:37.942 --> 38:40.862
As a result of the choices
he made in life,

38:40.945 --> 38:44.908
he leaves behind a troublesome legacy.

38:46.242 --> 38:47.952
From the very start,

38:48.745 --> 38:53.124
like a tree whose branches are
equaled in scope by its roots...

38:53.917 --> 38:56.252
half visible, half hidden...

38:56.961 --> 39:00.215
Isaac was part mystery.

39:01.925 --> 39:04.803
He worked with us,

39:06.638 --> 39:08.515
he explored with us,

39:10.141 --> 39:13.395
he celebrated alongside us in victory,

39:15.105 --> 39:18.650
and he grieved alongside us in failure.

39:21.945 --> 39:26.157
And, while Isaac never felt
any of this on his own...

39:28.243 --> 39:30.036
we felt it for him.

39:32.580 --> 39:37.293
<i>He was as passionate or as stoic</i>

39:37.377 --> 39:40.213
<i>as we willed him to be in our minds.</i>

39:42.507 --> 39:46.511
<i>And, for that reason,</i>
<i>I suppose each of us knew</i>

39:46.594 --> 39:48.388
<i>a different Isaac.</i>

39:50.348 --> 39:53.768
<i>And, each of us will acknowledge this loss</i>

39:53.852 --> 39:55.395
<i>as we see fit.</i>

39:57.856 --> 40:01.776
<i>There's no wrong way to say goodbye.</i>

40:02.986 --> 40:04.696
(beeping)

40:14.289 --> 40:15.415
Hi, Mom.

40:15.957 --> 40:17.500
ISAAC: <i>Hello, Doctor.</i>

40:19.336 --> 40:20.795
End simulation.

40:23.798 --> 40:25.717
(door closing)

40:25.800 --> 40:26.843
Ty.

40:27.677 --> 40:29.596
Honey, what...

40:30.138 --> 40:31.848
what are you doing?

40:32.057 --> 40:35.060
I wanted to talk to Isaac.

40:35.143 --> 40:37.520
I know, baby, we all do.

40:37.604 --> 40:39.397
The simulator can bring him back.

40:39.981 --> 40:43.234
No, Ty. It can't.

40:43.318 --> 40:46.029
I know it's comforting, but it's not real.

40:46.696 --> 40:49.699
The simulator is fun for games,

40:49.783 --> 40:53.161
but you can't use it to
bring back people you've lost.

40:53.620 --> 40:54.704
Why not?

40:54.788 --> 40:57.457
It can impede the healing process.

40:57.999 --> 40:59.959
I've treated patients who've developed

41:00.043 --> 41:03.254
real problems using this room to...

41:03.338 --> 41:05.548
hold onto someone who's died.

41:07.717 --> 41:09.177
I know you miss him.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.513
And it's gonna be hard for a while.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.765
But, I promise...

41:14.683 --> 41:16.184
it will get easier.

41:16.768 --> 41:17.894
When?

41:18.561 --> 41:19.771
Soon.

41:20.355 --> 41:21.815
You'll see.

41:24.192 --> 41:25.193
Ty!

41:27.862 --> 41:29.906
(doors whirring)

41:38.289 --> 41:42.043
Simulation Isaac-8443.

43:04.793 --> 43:06.252
(sobbing)

43:11.299 --> 43:12.342
(sniffles)

43:16.721 --> 43:17.597
(sniffles)

43:22.352 --> 43:23.937
(gears rattling)

43:27.941 --> 43:29.359
(electronic chittering)

43:39.494 --> 43:40.829
(clangs)

43:40.912 --> 43:43.623
Boom. That's it. Nice job, everyone.

43:43.707 --> 43:46.960
And, in two-thirds of the time.
We should all get big bonuses.

43:47.043 --> 43:48.753
Check's in the mail.

43:57.679 --> 43:58.847
Lamarr to bridge.

43:58.930 --> 44:00.348
ED: (over comm) <i>Mercer here. Go ahead.</i>

44:00.432 --> 44:01.683
We're all done out there.

44:01.766 --> 44:03.143
Unless you want the windows tinted,

44:03.226 --> 44:04.519
that's it for the refit.

44:04.602 --> 44:06.021
We can ship out on your order.

44:06.104 --> 44:07.814
I think we can do without the windows.

44:07.897 --> 44:10.191
-Tell your team great work.
-JOHN: (over comm) <i>Will do.</i>

44:10.275 --> 44:13.361
Lieutenant Keyali, transmit
systems report to dockyard,

44:13.445 --> 44:14.988
and request clearance for departure.

44:15.071 --> 44:16.114
Aye, sir.

44:16.364 --> 44:20.869
Ensign Burke.
Set course bearing 74 mark 136.

44:20.952 --> 44:22.412
Course laid in, sir.

44:22.495 --> 44:24.247
Receiving confirmation from dockyard:

44:24.330 --> 44:26.041
all access ports are sealed.

44:26.124 --> 44:28.376
Mooring clamps are primed for release.

44:28.543 --> 44:29.669
We are cleared.

44:40.805 --> 44:42.098
Gordon, take us out.

44:42.349 --> 44:44.142
Aye, sir.

44:45.143 --> 44:47.520
(expansive orchestral music playing)

45:58.550 --> 46:00.593
Engage quantum drive.

46:13.565 --> 46:15.025
(exhales sharply)

46:18.403 --> 46:19.738
You okay?

46:19.904 --> 46:21.823
Yeah, I think my hips are
bleeding a little bit, but...

46:21.906 --> 46:22.949
(Irillia giggles)

46:23.033 --> 46:24.200
...other than that, I'm all good.

46:24.284 --> 46:26.703
Did you study Dakeeli biology
or something?

46:26.786 --> 46:28.371
-Nope.
-Well, you certainly

46:28.455 --> 46:30.290
seem to know your way around.

46:30.373 --> 46:31.458
Educated guess.

46:31.541 --> 46:32.667
Hmm.

46:32.751 --> 46:34.753
So, it is true what they say about you.

46:34.836 --> 46:36.129
Well, what do they say about me?

46:36.212 --> 46:38.298
That you like the ladies.

46:38.798 --> 46:39.883
I like <i>this </i>lady.

46:40.383 --> 46:41.468
Good answer.

46:42.552 --> 46:46.222
And you know Dakeelians
like a limahll stick after sex.

46:46.306 --> 46:48.099
-Got one in the drawer.
-(inhales sharply)

46:48.183 --> 46:49.976
You are really racking up the points.

46:52.937 --> 46:55.774
Oh. Got a fork in here.

46:56.191 --> 46:58.735
Are you hoarding from the mess hall?

46:58.818 --> 47:00.153
Nah, that, um...

47:00.236 --> 47:02.822
was a birthday gift, from Isaac.

47:02.906 --> 47:05.408
He got you a fork for your birthday?

47:05.492 --> 47:08.286
Yeah, Gordon was trying
to explain birthdays to him.

47:08.370 --> 47:10.663
The whole idea of presents and whatnot.

47:10.747 --> 47:12.791
He just forgot to tell him
the present should be

47:12.874 --> 47:14.626
specifically picked out for the person.

47:14.709 --> 47:16.211
Can't just be anything.

47:16.294 --> 47:19.255
Isaac didn't know, so he, uh...

47:19.339 --> 47:20.924
he gave me a fork.

47:21.007 --> 47:22.759
We all thought it was hilarious, and...

47:23.593 --> 47:24.803
I kept it.

47:25.428 --> 47:26.304
IRILLIA: Mm.

47:27.806 --> 47:29.474
What are they gonna do with him?

47:30.517 --> 47:32.727
We're supposed to deliver him
to Epsilon 2.

47:32.894 --> 47:35.313
I guess the science team there
wants to do some...

47:36.022 --> 47:37.440
Kaylon research.

47:38.566 --> 47:40.193
Do you...

47:40.819 --> 47:43.405
think he was wrong to do what he did?

47:43.988 --> 47:45.323
To take his own life?

47:46.032 --> 47:47.325
Of course, I do.

47:48.076 --> 47:51.579
I've just noticed that a lot of
the crew seem somber about it.

47:51.663 --> 47:53.415
Even some of the people who hated him.

47:53.957 --> 47:55.458
Well, it's suicide.

47:55.709 --> 47:58.086
It's a tough thing to process
no matter who it is.

47:58.169 --> 48:00.630
On my homeworld, it's different.

48:00.714 --> 48:02.257
Different how?

48:02.340 --> 48:07.721
Well, it's accepted that no one
makes the choice to exist.

48:07.804 --> 48:11.641
And, some feel that they were
grabbed out of the void,

48:11.725 --> 48:14.102
and thrust into existence
against their will.

48:14.894 --> 48:16.521
Life isn't appealing to everyone.

48:16.604 --> 48:18.106
Tastes vary.

48:18.189 --> 48:20.900
So, when someone decides to end theirs,

48:21.526 --> 48:23.319
we see it as a personal decision.

48:23.403 --> 48:26.364
What happens if you change
your mind after the fact?

48:26.448 --> 48:27.824
That's never happened.

48:27.949 --> 48:30.326
-That's my point.
-Okay, well, don't get mad,

48:30.410 --> 48:32.203
I'm just trying to tell you
how it is on Dakeel.

48:32.287 --> 48:35.623
No, I'm not mad, it's just...
It seems insane.

48:35.790 --> 48:37.459
A-a-a personal decision is-is

48:37.542 --> 48:39.210
whether to shave your beard or not.

48:39.294 --> 48:41.212
And even if you do, it'll grow back.

48:41.296 --> 48:42.839
Why don't you let me shave your beard,

48:42.922 --> 48:45.550
and then I can work my way
down from there? Hmm?

48:46.134 --> 48:48.511
-Okay, it was a joke.
-It's ju-- (sighs)

48:48.595 --> 48:50.513
It's just, what you're
telling me is messed up.

48:50.597 --> 48:52.307
At-at least where I'm from.

48:53.475 --> 48:55.518
On my planet, the memory of others

48:55.602 --> 48:57.437
commands the highest respect.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.314
Not even death can touch it.

48:59.397 --> 49:02.400
So someday, if I die first,

49:02.484 --> 49:04.235
you just make sure to keep me nestled

49:04.319 --> 49:06.279
in that pretty little head of yours,

49:06.404 --> 49:08.907
and I will always be with you.

49:11.493 --> 49:12.577
What's wrong?

49:14.996 --> 49:17.082
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to rattle you.

49:17.165 --> 49:18.917
Stay as long as you want.

49:19.125 --> 49:20.377
John!

49:26.007 --> 49:28.218
-Commander? Everything okay?
-I-I don't know yet!

49:28.301 --> 49:31.888
♪♪

49:58.206 --> 49:59.791
Anybody got a weapon?

50:00.417 --> 50:01.334
A weapon!

50:01.835 --> 50:02.961
Unk!

50:03.044 --> 50:04.295
Hey, Unk!

50:06.631 --> 50:07.507
Unk!

50:07.590 --> 50:08.466
(speaks alien language)

50:08.550 --> 50:09.634
Yes, Commander?

50:12.137 --> 50:13.555
Step on that for me.

50:14.055 --> 50:14.931
Sir?

50:15.056 --> 50:16.683
Step on it hard. Smash it.

50:17.892 --> 50:19.102
(clangs)

50:28.611 --> 50:31.990
It's too small to be seen with
the naked eye, but it's there.

50:32.073 --> 50:33.408
How'd you find it?

50:33.491 --> 50:35.535
Well, way back in the days
of the early computers,

50:35.618 --> 50:37.287
the programmers would
sometimes bury a code

50:37.370 --> 50:38.413
deep inside the system,

50:38.621 --> 50:40.248
something that only they knew about,

50:40.331 --> 50:42.208
in case they wanted
to get back in later on.

50:42.292 --> 50:45.253
I thought maybe the Kaylon
might've done something similar.

50:45.337 --> 50:47.172
Essentially a "backup consciousness."

50:47.255 --> 50:49.591
So, he could still be in there somewhere.

50:49.674 --> 50:52.177
It's possible. I mean,
think about the human brain.

50:52.260 --> 50:53.636
It's packed with redundancies

50:53.720 --> 50:55.680
that have evolved over billions of years.

50:55.764 --> 50:57.849
It's like a Rube Goldberg contraption.

50:57.932 --> 51:00.685
And the Kaylon brain was
designed by intelligent beings.

51:00.769 --> 51:02.520
It would have to be more efficient.

51:02.604 --> 51:04.981
Maybe with deliberate redundancies.

51:05.065 --> 51:07.734
Wouldn't Isaac have accounted
for that when he killed himself?

51:07.817 --> 51:09.277
Maybe, maybe not.

51:09.361 --> 51:12.030
Could be he thought we'd never
be able to activate it.

51:12.113 --> 51:14.449
Or... he didn't know about it himself.

51:14.532 --> 51:15.992
With Isaac, it seems more likely

51:16.076 --> 51:18.244
he'd bet on our tiny brains
missing it altogether.

51:18.328 --> 51:21.039
Here's the thing: The
storage cell has been exposed.

51:21.122 --> 51:22.415
It was the only way I could get at it.

51:22.874 --> 51:24.250
I have it in a stasis field right now,

51:24.334 --> 51:26.628
but if there's any kind of a power surge,

51:26.711 --> 51:29.381
or gravitational anomaly,
it could destabilize it.

51:29.464 --> 51:30.715
We've been lucky so far,

51:30.799 --> 51:32.926
but if we want to do something,
it's gotta be soon.

51:33.093 --> 51:34.427
You mean revive him?

51:35.970 --> 51:37.722
This is subatomic technology.

51:37.806 --> 51:39.766
The ship's computer
would have to do that, right?

51:39.849 --> 51:41.351
That's exactly why it can't.

51:41.434 --> 51:42.519
This is way smaller

51:42.602 --> 51:44.396
than the smallest nanotech we have.

51:44.479 --> 51:47.732
I wouldn't trust the computer
to stay ahead of any surprises.

51:47.816 --> 51:51.152
What we need is the intuitive
power of a biological brain,

51:51.236 --> 51:52.987
along with the visualization capacity

51:53.071 --> 51:55.031
to work in multiple dimensions.

51:56.074 --> 51:57.242
Charly...

52:13.299 --> 52:14.843
If it was anyone other than you,

52:14.926 --> 52:16.970
I'd suspect this was
some kind of sick joke.

52:17.053 --> 52:19.305
Look, I know this isn't easy,

52:19.389 --> 52:22.308
but you have a gift
that comes along maybe...

52:22.392 --> 52:24.144
once in a generation.

52:24.352 --> 52:27.355
No one else has your capacity
for dimensional visualization.

52:27.439 --> 52:29.274
So I am asking for your help.

52:29.357 --> 52:31.443
We have a dead Kaylon.

52:31.526 --> 52:33.528
And you want me to help
bring him back to life?

52:33.611 --> 52:34.571
Yes.

52:34.863 --> 52:37.323
Okay, how about this:

52:37.407 --> 52:40.827
I'll do it if he can
bring back Amanda. Deal?

52:40.910 --> 52:42.162
Look, Ensign, try to see--

52:42.245 --> 52:43.705
No. No way.

52:45.707 --> 52:48.960
I'm sorry, Captain,
but I'm not gonna do it.

52:49.044 --> 52:52.255
He's dead and he deserves to be dead.

52:55.216 --> 52:57.385
He was a member of this crew.

52:57.677 --> 53:00.055
Some would say that makes you duty-bound.

53:01.181 --> 53:02.849
Yeah, some would say.

53:04.434 --> 53:07.687
So, your willingness
to assist a fellow crewman

53:07.771 --> 53:11.107
depends on your personal
feelings at the time?

53:12.734 --> 53:16.154
It depends on whether they've
murdered people I know, yeah.

53:16.738 --> 53:18.615
Other than that, I'm happy to help.

53:18.865 --> 53:21.284
Look, Isaac is our only link
to the Kaylon, if he--

53:21.368 --> 53:22.827
With all due respect, Captain,

53:22.911 --> 53:25.080
I don't know what you think
you're gonna get out of him.

53:25.163 --> 53:28.041
Some secret Kaylon code
that changes the entire game?

53:28.124 --> 53:30.251
It hasn't happened! What has happened,

53:30.335 --> 53:31.795
is that they've killed
thousands of people!

53:31.878 --> 53:33.672
All right, so be better than they are!

53:33.838 --> 53:35.799
Show the galaxy that humans are different,

53:35.882 --> 53:39.386
that we value life,
even when our enemies don't!

53:41.012 --> 53:42.430
Do you think Amanda would agree?

53:43.306 --> 53:44.182
(scoffs)

53:45.934 --> 53:47.769
You know, Charly,

53:48.395 --> 53:51.439
you're not the only one
who lost friends in that battle.

53:52.065 --> 53:53.483
And I'm really sorry that you did,

53:53.566 --> 53:54.609
and I'm sorry that I did,

53:54.693 --> 53:56.736
but this thing you do,

53:56.820 --> 53:59.781
where you act like you have some
kind of a monopoly on grief,

53:59.864 --> 54:01.616
is starting to wear a little thin.

54:03.368 --> 54:05.620
Now, I am imploring you to do this.

54:06.413 --> 54:07.706
Will you help?

54:09.791 --> 54:11.459
(crashing)

54:12.085 --> 54:14.337

54:15.672 --> 54:17.007

54:34.607 --> 54:36.651
800,000 kilometers and closing.

54:36.735 --> 54:38.945
Burke, how far are
we from the Phycor system?

54:39.029 --> 54:40.780
Approximately 5.9 light-years.

54:40.864 --> 54:42.657
-Gordon, hang a right.
-On it.

54:52.917 --> 54:54.836

55:59.818 --> 56:00.860
They don't have to,

56:01.069 --> 56:02.654

do their job for them.

Twenty-six.

Oh, it's okay.

59:35.700 --> 59:38.078
I did hear about what happened in the lab.

59:59.516 --> 01:00:01.142
I wanted to ask

01:00:01.226 --> 01:00:05.063
if you could please help Isaac.

01:00:06.314 --> 01:00:07.273

01:00:07.357 --> 01:00:08.233
Yeah.

01:00:08.858 --> 01:00:11.111
Why do you want to help Isaac?

Because...

01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:17.450
I'm the reason he killed himself.

01:00:18.493 --> 01:00:21.454
What... makes you think that?

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:24.666
I told him...

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:30.088
I told him I wished he was dead.

01:00:30.296 --> 01:00:32.132

01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:39.848
it's nobody's fault.

01:00:40.932 --> 01:00:43.351
I said it to his face.

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:44.769
And, I meant it.

01:00:45.979 --> 01:00:48.940
I mean, a-at the time I did.

01:00:49.441 --> 01:00:51.568
It's human instinct

01:00:51.651 --> 01:00:53.945
to look for someone or something to blame

01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:55.447

01:00:59.868 --> 01:01:01.494
try to fill in the blanks.

01:01:02.662 --> 01:01:05.165
Even if it means betraying ourselves.

01:01:06.666 --> 01:01:08.209
Are you glad he's dead?

01:01:09.252 --> 01:01:10.920
I think...

01:01:12.213 --> 01:01:14.132
when anyone dies...

01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:16.468
it's a tragedy.

01:01:17.052 --> 01:01:18.428
But, are you glad?

01:01:19.929 --> 01:01:20.889
Yes.

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:22.807
I am.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.562
But, you don't want to be like me.

01:01:28.063 --> 01:01:30.857
You don't wanna
carry that around inside you.

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.068
Not at your age.

01:01:36.654 --> 01:01:38.239
It's not your fault.

01:01:40.408 --> 01:01:42.160
I hated him.

01:01:43.286 --> 01:01:44.621
I just...

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.957
I didn't really want him to die.

01:02:01.429 --> 01:02:02.639
(rumbling)

01:02:02.722 --> 01:02:04.933
(sparking, whirring)

01:02:21.074 --> 01:02:22.826
JOHN: Picking up activity at
the quantum level.

01:02:22.909 --> 01:02:23.910
CHARLY: His center matrix

01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:25.328
is registering environmental stimuli.

01:02:25.412 --> 01:02:27.372
JOHN: Alpha theta transients
are stabilizing.

01:02:27.455 --> 01:02:29.416
CHARLY: Internal power cells
are re-conforming.

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:30.750
JOHN: I think we got him.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.419
Hang on. Phase-matching the autonomic

01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:34.045
and cognitive neural interfaces.

01:02:34.129 --> 01:02:35.755
-Can I lock it in?
-Stand by.

01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:38.717
This is like catching
a swarm of bees with a net.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.135
If one gets loose...

01:02:41.386 --> 01:02:42.554
Wait.

01:02:43.179 --> 01:02:46.391
There. Okay. Lock it.

01:02:54.232 --> 01:02:55.233
CLAIRE: Isaac.

01:02:56.484 --> 01:02:57.736
Are you okay?

01:02:57.819 --> 01:02:59.696
ISAAC: <i>I am in engineering.</i>

01:02:59.779 --> 01:03:03.074
Here's that genius brain.
We missed you, buddy.

01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:04.951
<i>I do not understand.</i>

01:03:05.035 --> 01:03:07.245
<i>Was the narrowband pulse ineffective?</i>

01:03:07.328 --> 01:03:10.582
It was effective.
We just brought you back.

01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:12.751
Actually... Charly did.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.420
<i>Please explain.</i>

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.257
Captain. Permission to return to duty.

01:03:19.924 --> 01:03:21.301
Granted.

01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:29.684
I didn't do it for you.

01:03:46.242 --> 01:03:47.952
How are you feeling?

01:03:48.036 --> 01:03:51.331
<i>Commander Lamarr has verified</i>
<i>that my internal systems</i>

01:03:51.414 --> 01:03:53.792
<i>are functioning</i>
<i>within standard parameters.</i>

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:55.001
I mean <i>you.</i>

01:03:55.085 --> 01:03:56.920
How are <i>you </i>feeling?

01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:59.839
<i>I do not understand the inquiry.</i>

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.050
Isaac...

01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:07.347
my training is in biological psychiatry.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:08.682
There's no precedent

01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:11.726
for the psychoanalysis
of an artificial lifeform.

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.895
But, we have to try anyway.

01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:16.147
Why did you do it?

01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:17.399
<i>I have determined</i>

01:04:17.482 --> 01:04:19.693
<i>that my presence aboard the Orville has,</i>

01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:21.903
<i>since the resolution</i>
<i>of the Earth conflict,</i>

01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:25.115
<i>been largely detrimental to</i>
<i>the operation of this vessel.</i>

01:04:25.198 --> 01:04:28.743
<i>I have caused great distress</i>
<i>to a majority of the crew.</i>

01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:31.121
<i>This has no doubt reduced their efficiency</i>

01:04:31.204 --> 01:04:33.081
<i>by a significant percentage.</i>

01:04:33.164 --> 01:04:34.958
<i>My deactivation was intended</i>

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.127
<i>to restore maximum operational output</i>

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:38.378
<i>aboard the Orville.</i>

01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:41.923
And, that's it?

01:04:42.007 --> 01:04:43.049
<i>Correct.</i>

01:04:43.466 --> 01:04:45.802
Did any small part of you do it

01:04:45.885 --> 01:04:48.722
because you felt the sting
of being ostracized?

01:04:48.805 --> 01:04:50.724
<i>Negative. I am incapable of--</i>

01:04:50.807 --> 01:04:52.809
I know. I-I-I-I know. I just--

01:04:52.892 --> 01:04:53.852
(sighs)

01:04:55.311 --> 01:04:57.313
I'm looking for a way in.

01:04:57.605 --> 01:04:58.940
<i>Please clarify.</i>

01:04:59.024 --> 01:05:02.193
Damn it, Isaac,
you tried to kill yourself!

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:04.988
And I need to know that
you're not gonna do it again!

01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:06.948
<i>There is no reason to surmise</i>

01:05:07.032 --> 01:05:08.616
<i>that crew efficiency will improve</i>

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.201
<i>without my deactivation.</i>

01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:11.244
Okay.

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:13.121
Um...

01:05:13.329 --> 01:05:16.958
I can see we need to do this
more logically.

01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:20.795
Do you accept my status
as primary authority

01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:23.506
when it comes to the
psychological well-being

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:24.507
of this crew?

01:05:24.591 --> 01:05:25.633
<i>Yes.</i>

01:05:25.717 --> 01:05:27.177
And, do you acknowledge,

01:05:27.469 --> 01:05:29.596
when it comes to human behavior,

01:05:29.679 --> 01:05:32.432
that my judgment as a medical professional

01:05:32.515 --> 01:05:34.976
is superior to yours?

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.019
<i>Yes.</i>

01:05:36.102 --> 01:05:38.063
Then it is only logical

01:05:38.146 --> 01:05:41.274
for you to accept my assertion

01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:44.444
that the psychological damage to this crew

01:05:44.527 --> 01:05:46.321
would be much greater

01:05:46.404 --> 01:05:49.949
if you succeeded in taking your own life.

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.619
<i>Your reasoning is sound.</i>

01:05:52.827 --> 01:05:53.870
Isaac...

01:05:54.245 --> 01:05:57.874
you arrived at your decision
based on your analysis

01:05:57.957 --> 01:05:59.959
of all currently available data.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.420
But, what you didn't take into account,

01:06:02.504 --> 01:06:04.756
was the possibility of change.

01:06:04.839 --> 01:06:07.217
You don't know how this crew
is going to feel

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.719
a year or even a month from now.

01:06:09.803 --> 01:06:11.221
<i>I did not apply that data,</i>

01:06:11.304 --> 01:06:13.014
<i>as it is unavailable at this time.</i>

01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:14.349
That's my point!

01:06:14.432 --> 01:06:17.560
People who try to take their own lives

01:06:17.644 --> 01:06:21.481
are unable to distinguish
the future from the present.

01:06:21.564 --> 01:06:27.195
There is no problem so immense
that it can't be solved in time.

01:06:27.487 --> 01:06:29.406
<i>It would appear so.</i>

01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:32.450
<i>How soon shall I expect</i>
<i>this change among the crew?</i>

01:06:32.534 --> 01:06:34.703
You're a Kaylon.

01:06:34.869 --> 01:06:38.164
Your people would like to see us all dead.

01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:43.336
But, you're also a person,
and you're here with us.

01:06:43.837 --> 01:06:47.215
And, it's a lot harder to hate
from up close.

01:06:48.258 --> 01:06:49.843
Look...

01:06:52.303 --> 01:06:54.848
I just need to know
that you're going to be safe.

01:06:55.432 --> 01:07:00.311
If at any time in the future
you have these thoughts,

01:07:00.395 --> 01:07:02.856
you come to me!

01:07:06.192 --> 01:07:07.527
Do you promise?

01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:11.281
<i>I... promise.</i>

01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:15.535
Good.

01:07:15.618 --> 01:07:17.746
<i>Has our session concluded?</i>

01:07:19.956 --> 01:07:21.624
I guess it has.

01:07:24.753 --> 01:07:25.879
Isaac?

01:07:29.924 --> 01:07:32.093
I'm glad you're still here.

01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:34.679
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>
