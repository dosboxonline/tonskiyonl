<i>Mm, royal beluga. North of the Caspian.</i>

16:29.739 --> 16:33.289
<i>- You're full of surprises, Contessa.
- So are you, Mr Bond.</i>

16:34.619 --> 16:37.213
<i>Do you always arm yourself
for a rendezvous?</i>

16:37.288 --> 16:40.383
<i>Occasionally. I seem
to be accident-prone.</i>

16:40.458 --> 16:42.631
<i>I'll take that, if you don't mind.</i>

16:42.710 --> 16:47.466
<i>You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Suppose I were to kill you for a thrill.</i>

16:47.548 --> 16:50.472
<i>I can think of something
more sociable to do.</i>

16:51.928 --> 16:55.353
<i>Will you stop playing games?
Who was that man in your room?</i>

16:55.431 --> 16:58.025
<i>- You're hurting me.
- I thought that was the idea.</i>

16:58.100 --> 17:00.899
<i>- Who was he?
- I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

17:02.188 --> 17:06.193
<i>- I can be a lot more persuasive.
- I'm sure you can.</i>

17:09.194 --> 17:11.823
<i>Whatever else I may be, I'm not a liar.</i>

17:15.117 --> 17:17.211
<i>Get dressed.</i>

17:40.351 --> 17:42.854
<i>{Bond) You're the most extraordinary girl.</i>

17:42.937 --> 17:46.066
<i>I'm not interested
in your opinion of me, Mr Bond.</i>

17:46.148 --> 17:49.277
<i>- I'm here for a business transaction.
- Really?</i>

17:54.949 --> 17:57.122
<i>Isn't Le Bleu a bit heady for that?</i>

17:58.035 --> 18:01.460
<i>So, you know your perfumes.
What else do you know?</i>

18:01.539 --> 18:03.633
<i>A little about women.</i>

18:04.166 --> 18:05.918
<i>Think about me</i>

18:06.002 --> 18:08.300
<i>as a woman you've just bought.</i>

18:08.879 --> 18:10.973
<i>Who needs to buy?</i>

18:14.594 --> 18:16.688
<i>Look, you don't owe me a thing.</i>

18:19.765 --> 18:22.268
<i>I think you're in some sort of trouble.</i>

18:22.351 --> 18:24.103
<i>Would you like to talk about it?</i>

18:24.186 --> 18:26.063
<i>No, Mr Bond.</i>

18:26.147 --> 18:29.902
<i>The only thing you need know about me
is that I pay my debts.</i>

18:31.402 --> 18:33.496
<i>20,000 francs is a lot of money.</i>

18:35.281 --> 18:36.954
<i>Mm.</i>

18:43.456 --> 18:45.550
<i>{screeching, laughing)</i>

19:11.567 --> 19:13.035
<i>{woman) Good morning.</i>

19:13.110 --> 19:16.660
<i>- Morning. Café for two with orange juice.
- Yes, sir.</i>

19:16.739 --> 19:21.745
<i>- Connect me with suite 423, please.
- The Countess has left the hotel, sir.</i>

19:21.827 --> 19:24.125
<i>- Checked out?
- A few minutes ago.</i>

19:24.205 --> 19:26.082
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:37.760 --> 19:39.637
<i>Paid in full as well.</i>

19:49.313 --> 19:50.986
<i>- Mr Bond?
- Yes.</i>

19:51.065 --> 19:53.284
<i>- You've lost something.
- Really?</i>

19:57.488 --> 19:59.991
<i>We'll give it to you outside.</i>

20:00.908 --> 20:03.627
<i>Why not? Perhaps
we can make up a foursome!</i>

20:05.705 --> 20:10.757
<i>You've thought of everything. What a
lovely surprise, meeting again so soon!</i>

20:10.835 --> 20:13.338
<i>- Mm.
- Thank you.</i>

20:19.218 --> 20:22.643
<i>- And where's the party this time?
- You have an appointment.</i>

20:22.722 --> 20:24.816
<i>Business or pleasure?</i>

20:27.101 --> 20:29.195
<i>Mystery tour, eh?</i>

20:30.771 --> 20:33.274
<i>I think we'd all enjoy it more without that.</i>

20:34.734 --> 20:36.407
<i>Mmm.</i>

20:44.493 --> 20:46.370
<i>{ship's hooter)</i>

21:41.884 --> 21:43.761
<i>Basta!</i>

21:46.388 --> 21:50.063
<i>Do not kill me, Mr Bond.
At least not until we've had a drink.</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:53.191
<i>Then if you wish,
I'll give you another chance.</i>

21:53.312 --> 21:55.406
<i>I'm Draco of Draco Construction.</i>

21:59.735 --> 22:01.829
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

22:08.160 --> 22:11.289
<i>- But today is the 13th, Commander.
- I'm superstitious.</i>

22:11.372 --> 22:13.966
<i>- A martini for our guest, Olympe.
- A pleasure.</i>

22:14.041 --> 22:16.590
<i>- Shaken, not stirred.
- Of course.</i>

22:16.669 --> 22:18.763
<i>- Campari for me.
- Mm-hm.</i>

22:20.172 --> 22:23.972
<i>My apologies for the way you were
brought here today. Please sit down.</i>

22:24.051 --> 22:27.180
<i>I was not sure
you would accept a formal invitation.</i>

22:27.263 --> 22:30.858
<i>There's always something formal
about the point of a pistol.</i>

22:30.933 --> 22:32.401
<i>{chuckles)</i>

22:32.476 --> 22:34.149
<i>Thank you, chérie.</i>

22:34.228 --> 22:37.448
<i>- Olympe, we will finish our struggle later.
- As you wish.</i>

22:38.691 --> 22:41.911
<i>She also plays
a very good game of chess.</i>

22:41.986 --> 22:44.284
<i>- Salute.
- Cheers.</i>

22:44.989 --> 22:47.083
<i>You usually drink Corsican brandy.</i>

22:47.157 --> 22:49.910
<i>Ah! What else do you know about me?</i>

22:49.994 --> 22:54.591
<i>Marc Ange Draco. Head of Union Corse,
one of Europe's biggest crime syndicates.</i>

22:54.665 --> 22:56.542
<i>- The biggest.
- Not quite.</i>

22:56.625 --> 22:59.799
<i>An organisation known as SPECTRE
operates worldwide.</i>

22:59.879 --> 23:03.509
<i>However, your legitimate business fronts
are more extensive.</i>

23:03.591 --> 23:07.812
<i>Construction, electrical supplies,
numerous agricultural holdings.</i>

23:07.887 --> 23:10.811
<i>{tuts) Your dossier on me</i>

23:11.932 --> 23:14.026
<i>is not entirely complete.</i>

23:15.978 --> 23:18.072
<i>I am also Teresa's father.</i>

23:19.106 --> 23:22.030
<i>- Tracy?
- Yes, Tracy. Tracy.</i>

23:22.776 --> 23:24.653
<i>My only child.</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:29.458
<i>Her mother was an English girl-
romantic -</i>

23:29.533 --> 23:32.332
<i>who had come to Corsica
to look for bandits.</i>

23:32.786 --> 23:37.462
<i>Rather like those women who ventured
into the desert looking for sheikhs.</i>

23:37.541 --> 23:39.635
<i>She found me in the mountains.</i>

23:40.169 --> 23:42.513
<i>Hiding from the police at the time.</i>

23:42.588 --> 23:44.465
<i>I came to love this girl.</i>

23:44.548 --> 23:47.472
<i>We married. The result: Teresa.</i>

23:49.011 --> 23:52.641
<i>Twelve years later my wife died.
I sent Teresa to Switzerland</i>

23:52.723 --> 23:56.148
<i>- No, thanks. I prefer my own.
-to finish her education.</i>

23:56.226 --> 24:00.481
<i>Unfortunately I didn't give her a proper
home. She was without supervision.</i>

24:00.564 --> 24:02.237
<i>O</i>

24:02.316 --> 24:06.037
<i>she joined the fast international set.
One scandal after another.</i>

24:06.111 --> 24:10.287
<i>When I disapproved,
cut off her allowance,</i>

24:11.200 --> 24:13.703
<i>she committed some greater folly.</i>

24:14.620 --> 24:16.714
<i>To spite me.</i>

24:19.375 --> 24:23.846
<i>Yet, behind her bravado,
something was eating away at her soul.</i>

24:23.921 --> 24:26.424
<i>This can happen to men and women.</i>

24:27.007 --> 24:30.477
<i>They burn the heart out of themselves
by living too greedily.</i>

24:30.552 --> 24:32.646
<i>And suddenly,</i>

24:34.264 --> 24:36.892
<i>-all is finished.
- Why are you telling me this?</i>

24:36.976 --> 24:41.982
<i>Without telling me, she married. An Italian
count who killed himself in a Maserati</i>

24:42.064 --> 24:45.238
<i>with one of his mistresses.</i>

24:45.317 --> 24:48.161
<i>I gave her too much,
and it brought her nothing.</i>

24:48.404 --> 24:51.123
<i>Now, why did I tell you all this?</i>

24:53.659 --> 24:57.459
<i>I have been informed of everything
you have done for my daughter.</i>

24:57.538 --> 25:01.088
<i>- Everything?
- Don't worry, don't worry about that.</i>

25:01.792 --> 25:05.387
<i>What you did, the way you behaved,
might be the beginning</i>

25:05.462 --> 25:07.385
<i>of some kind of therapy.</i>

25:07.464 --> 25:09.558
<i>She needs help.</i>

25:11.176 --> 25:13.270
<i>Your help.</i>

25:13.345 --> 25:16.849
<i>I find her fascinating,
but she needs a psychiatrist, not me.</i>

25:16.932 --> 25:19.856
<i>What she needs is a man to dominate her.</i>

25:20.436 --> 25:23.406
<i>To make love to her enough
to make her love him.</i>

25:24.690 --> 25:26.784
<i>A man like you.</i>

25:27.568 --> 25:29.445
<i>You overestimate me, Draco.</i>

25:29.528 --> 25:32.498
<i>She's very attractive,
but what you ask is not for me.</i>

25:34.116 --> 25:35.789
<i>Mm.</i>

25:37.619 --> 25:40.714
<i>Listen to me. On the day you marry her,</i>

25:40.789 --> 25:44.794
<i>I'll give you a personal dowry
of one million pounds</i>

25:44.877 --> 25:46.629
<i>in gold.</i>

25:46.712 --> 25:48.806
<i>That's quite an inducement.</i>

25:50.632 --> 25:53.556
<i>- But I don't need a million pounds.
- Stupido!</i>

25:53.635 --> 25:55.888
<i>And I've a bachelor's taste for freedom.</i>

25:55.971 --> 25:58.690
<i>Please, just see her some more.</i>

25:58.766 --> 26:00.860
<i>Who knows what will come of it?</i>

26:00.934 --> 26:04.063
<i>I'm sorry, Draco,
but in my profession, I can't...</i>

26:04.146 --> 26:07.241
<i>- What?
- You have connections not open to me.</i>

26:07.983 --> 26:10.281
<i>Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?</i>

26:11.361 --> 26:13.455
<i>Blofeld?</i>

26:14.073 --> 26:16.542
<i>Some of my men
have recently defected to him.</i>

26:16.617 --> 26:19.666
<i>- I don't know where he is.
- Can you find out?</i>

26:19.745 --> 26:24.125
<i>If I could, I wouldn't tell
Her Majesty's Secret Service.</i>

26:24.666 --> 26:28.011
<i>But I might tell my future son-in-law.</i>

26:28.504 --> 26:30.598
<i>Go on.</i>

26:31.840 --> 26:33.934
<i>Next week is my birthday.</i>

26:34.760 --> 26:37.684
<i>For that,
Teresa always comes back to me.</i>

26:42.309 --> 26:45.654
<i>- You understand?
- Let's say I'll sleep on the idea.</i>

26:45.729 --> 26:46.855
<i>You do that.</i>

26:49.233 --> 26:53.454
<i>- James! Where have you been?
- Much too far from you, darling.</i>

26:53.529 --> 26:55.657
<i>Oh, same old James!</i>

26:55.739 --> 26:57.833
<i>Ooh! Only more so.</i>

26:58.700 --> 27:02.671
<i>Heartless brute! Letting me pine away
without even a postcard.</i>

27:02.746 --> 27:04.840
<i>Pine no more.</i>

27:05.374 --> 27:09.095
<i>{whispers) Cocktails at my place,
eightish, just the two of us.</i>

27:09.169 --> 27:11.263
<i>Oh, I'd adore that!</i>

27:11.797 --> 27:14.141
<i>If only I could trust myself.</i>

27:14.216 --> 27:17.720
<i>Same old Moneypenny.
Britain's last line of defence.</i>

27:18.178 --> 27:21.853
<i>You'd better go in.
He's running a very tight ship today.</i>

27:22.391 --> 27:24.268
<i>{clears throat)</i>

27:40.075 --> 27:42.999
<i>I'm relieving you
from Operation Bedlam, 007.</i>

27:43.078 --> 27:45.752
<i>But, sir, Blofeld's
something of a must with me.</i>

27:45.831 --> 27:48.050
<i>You've had two years to run him down.</i>

27:48.125 --> 27:52.301
<i>- Have you lost confidence in me?
- I'm well aware of your talents, 007.</i>

27:52.379 --> 27:55.849
<i>But a license to kill is useless,
unless one can set up the target.</i>

27:55.924 --> 27:58.677
<i>- Sir...
- I'll find you a more suitable assignment.</i>

27:58.760 --> 28:01.058
<i>- Under the circumstances...
- That's all!</i>

28:10.272 --> 28:12.149
<i>That was a quick conference.</i>

28:12.232 --> 28:16.282
<i>- How can a girl keep herself alluring...
- Take a memo, please, Moneypenny.</i>

28:19.198 --> 28:20.450
<i>Ready, James.</i>

28:20.532 --> 28:25.413
<i>Sir, I have the honour to request
if you'll accept my resignation</i>

28:25.495 --> 28:27.589
<i>effective forthwith.</i>

28:27.664 --> 28:31.294
<i>- Resignation from what?
- Her Majesty's Secret Service.</i>

28:31.376 --> 28:34.425
<i>And kindly present it
to that monument in there.</i>

<i>Request granted.</i>

29:57.546 --> 30:00.390
<i>Request granted. Not even with regret.</i>

30:00.465 --> 30:02.763
<i>What did you expect? A knighthood?</i>

30:03.635 --> 30:05.729
<i>Why don't you read it?</i>

30:07.556 --> 30:09.433
<i>Two weeks' leave!</i>

30:09.516 --> 30:12.645
<i>Well, you didn't really
want to resign, did you?</i>

30:13.437 --> 30:16.156
<i>Moneypenny,
what would I do without you?</i>

30:16.940 --> 30:19.784
<i>My problem is that
you never do anything with me.</i>

30:19.860 --> 30:22.079
<i>It's a date. The moment I get back.</i>

30:22.154 --> 30:25.078
<i>- Where are you off to?
- Oh, just some place to laze about.</i>

31:29.846 --> 31:31.723
<i>- Yes, very well.

<i>- Huh?
- Tracy.</i>

31:33.433 --> 31:36.277
<i>Where is she? Ah, there she is!</i>

31:36.770 --> 31:39.068
<i>- Teresa!
- Happy birthday, Papa.</i>

31:39.856 --> 31:42.780
<i>You make it so by being here.
You look marvellous.</i>

31:42.859 --> 31:45.112
<i>There's someone I want you to meet.</i>

31:45.195 --> 31:48.870
<i>- Salut, Olympe. How are you?
- It's good to have you back.</i>

31:50.242 --> 31:52.370
<i>- You look wonderful!
- Thanks.</i>

31:52.452 --> 31:54.329
<i>Bom dia. Bonjour.</i>

31:54.413 --> 31:57.758
<i>Mr Bond, may I introduce
my daughter? Teresa.</i>

31:57.833 --> 31:59.301
<i>Contessa.</i>

31:59.376 --> 32:02.846
<i>- We've already met.
- But each time is a renewed pleasure.</i>

32:04.506 --> 32:07.510
<i>Madame always makes one feel
so welcome!</i>

32:10.887 --> 32:12.981
<i>She likes you, I can see it.</i>

32:21.314 --> 32:22.987
<i>Brilliant.</i>

32:23.066 --> 32:25.489
<i>I didn't know Mr Bond knew Papa.</i>

32:25.569 --> 32:28.493
<i>There are many things
about Mr Bond one does not know.</i>

32:28.572 --> 32:32.122
<i>It would be interesting
to attend night school perhaps.</i>

32:34.995 --> 32:37.089
<i>{cheering and applause)</i>

32:38.165 --> 32:41.214
<i>Papa is up to something, I'm sure of it.</i>

32:41.293 --> 32:43.796
<i>Your father loves you very much, Tracy.</i>

32:43.879 --> 32:48.180
<i>Whatever he may arrange,
I know it's for your happiness.</i>

32:48.925 --> 32:52.099
<i>What has Papa arranged?</i>

<i>Ah! Mr Bond.</i>

33:08.069 --> 33:09.742
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:09.821 --> 33:11.698
<i>- Thank you.
- Many happy returns.</i>

33:11.781 --> 33:14.159
<i>The best years
are still to come, let's hope.</i>

33:14.242 --> 33:16.336
<i>Oh, allow me.</i>

33:16.411 --> 33:17.913
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

33:17.996 --> 33:20.545
<i>Yes, wasn't it kind
of your father to invite me?</i>

33:20.624 --> 33:22.752
<i>Mr Bond and I are discussing business.</i>

33:22.834 --> 33:25.963
<i>- Really?
- Mm-hm.</i>

33:26.046 --> 33:29.471
<i>No woman would waste excellent
champagne discussing business.</i>

33:29.549 --> 33:32.894
<i>Unless, of course, she happened
to be part of the arrangement.</i>

33:32.969 --> 33:34.642
<i>Olympe, what have you said?</i>

33:34.721 --> 33:37.565
<i>Don't blame Olympe.
I'm not your daughter for nothing.</i>

33:37.641 --> 33:39.735
<i>I detect a certain family resemblance.</i>

33:39.809 --> 33:43.188
<i>I suggest you revise the terms
of your contract, Mr Bond.</i>

33:43.271 --> 33:46.946
<i>- You'll find your liability too expensive.
- There you're mistaken.</i>

33:47.025 --> 33:48.277
<i>'Papa.
- Yes?</i>

33:48.360 --> 33:51.580
<i>- Mr Bond wants information.
- What are you talking about?</i>

33:51.655 --> 33:54.909
<i>You always taught me
a good host supplies his guest's needs.</i>

33:54.991 --> 33:57.710
<i>- Uh-huh.
- And without obligation.</i>

33:59.538 --> 34:02.883
<i>- And then?
- I'm not sure obligation is the right word.</i>

34:02.958 --> 34:04.585
<i>Tell him, Papa.</i>

34:04.668 --> 34:06.636
<i>Tell him what he wants to know.</i>

34:06.711 --> 34:09.840
<i>- Now!
- Please, please, Teresa.</i>

34:09.922 --> 34:12.346
<i>It's only a possibility, nothing definite.</i>

34:12.425 --> 34:15.224
<i>Tell him, Papa,
or you'll never see me again.</i>

34:21.810 --> 34:23.904
<i>All right.</i>

34:24.688 --> 34:26.281
<i>All right.</i>

34:26.356 --> 34:31.078
<i>There may be a connection between
that man Blofeld and the lawyer</i>

34:31.152 --> 34:33.449
<i>with offices in Bern, Switzerland.</i>

34:34.989 --> 34:37.288
<i>- Named Gumbold.
- Gumbold?</i>

34:37.367 --> 34:39.960
<i>- Bern, Switzerland?
- Yes, Gumbold.</i>

34:40.036 --> 34:43.916
<i>So, now Mr Bond need have
no further interest in me.</i>

34:43.998 --> 34:46.217
<i>Another mistake.</i>

34:46.293 --> 34:48.387
<i>She always was a headstrong child.</i>

34:49.004 --> 34:51.177
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

34:51.255 --> 34:52.849
<i>Where has he gone?</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:54.885
<i>{chanting)</i>

34:56.803 --> 34:58.680
<i>{cheering and applause)</i>

<i>Tracy!</i>

35:08.523 --> 35:09.991
<i>Tracy.</i>

35:10.066 --> 35:13.570
<i>I was always taught
that mistakes should be remedied.</i>

35:13.862 --> 35:15.956
<i>Especially between friends.</i>

35:20.327 --> 35:22.000
<i>Or lovers.</i>

<i>Ich hab noch ein paar Sachen zu kaufen.</i>

<i>Such things should be left to a girl's

40:40.146 --> 40:42.649
<i>That may come too some day.</i>

<i>Life's too short for "some day", Teresa.</i>

<i>- If you please, sir.
- Thank you.</i>

44:43.598 --> 44:46.727
<i>Unusually small

44:49.520 --> 44:53.946
<i>I wasn't aware that your expertise
included lepidoptery.</i>

44:54.025 --> 44:56.119
<i>Anyway, what are you doing here?</i>

44:56.194 --> 44:58.743
<i>Genealogy, sir. Fascinating subject.</i>

44:58.821 --> 45:03.167
<i>Came across a letter from Gebrﬂder
Gumbold, solicitors in Switzerland</i>

45:03.242 --> 45:06.086
<i>to a certain
Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp.</i>

45:06.162 --> 45:09.291
<i>- De Bleuchamp?
- French form of "Blofeld".</i>

45:10.708 --> 45:14.554
<i>You've been relieved from
Operation Bedlam, 007. Remember?</i>

45:14.629 --> 45:16.506
<i>I assumed you'd reassign me, sir.</i>

45:16.589 --> 45:19.138
<i>This is a Photostat copy of a letter</i>

45:19.217 --> 45:21.891
<i>to our College of Arms
in the City of London</i>

45:21.969 --> 45:26.566
<i>with the request they try to establish
de Bleuchamp's claim to the title,</i>

45:26.641 --> 45:30.066
<i>and Sir Hilary Bray
has replied to Gumbold</i>

45:30.144 --> 45:33.489
<i>suggesting that he should meet
de Bleuchamp in person.</i>

45:33.564 --> 45:37.159
<i>I've taken the liberty, sir,
of working with the college on this,</i>

45:37.235 --> 45:40.205
<i>using an examination
of my own family tree as cover.</i>

45:40.279 --> 45:43.374
<i>I've also been reading up
on the technical side of heraldry.</i>

45:43.449 --> 45:45.918
<i>Sir Hilary Bray, please. Commander Bond.</i>

45:45.993 --> 45:47.245
<i>Ah, yes, sir.</i>

45:47.328 --> 45:52.380
<i>So that, should he consent to meet, I can
act as a representative of the college.</i>

45:52.458 --> 45:53.926
<i>{man) Come.</i>

45:54.669 --> 45:57.172
<i>- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Sir Hilary.</i>

45:57.255 --> 46:03.183
<i>Have a look at this: arms of Sir Thomas
Bond. Baronet of Peckham. Died 1734.</i>

46:03.261 --> 46:05.138
<i>Argent on a chevron sable.</i>

46:05.221 --> 46:06.689
<i>Three bezants.</i>

46:06.764 --> 46:09.233
<i>Good motto, eh?
"The world is not enough."</i>

46:09.308 --> 46:12.608
<i>- You're doing a splendid job.
- Thank you, Mr Sable Basilisk.</i>

46:12.687 --> 46:15.440
<i>We've traced your line
back to Sir Otho le Bon.</i>

46:15.523 --> 46:21.201
<i>Held the manor of Wickhambreux by a
knight's fee from the Earl of Thanet, 1387.</i>

46:21.279 --> 46:22.952
<i>We're in luck.</i>

46:23.030 --> 46:27.456
<i>Gumbold's telephoned from Bern
to say his client has consented to see me.</i>

46:27.535 --> 46:29.412
<i>- You mean me?
- Yes, you.</i>

46:29.912 --> 46:34.042
<i>But, Commander Bond, I am only able
to countenance this deception</i>

46:34.125 --> 46:36.628
<i>if the matter is of national importance.</i>

46:36.711 --> 46:39.760
<i>I haven't exaggerated.
We appreciate your help.</i>

46:39.839 --> 46:44.310
<i>All right, then. I've arranged to lose myself
amongst the churches of Brittany.</i>

46:44.385 --> 46:46.638
<i>I want to do brass rubbings there anyway.</i>

46:46.721 --> 46:50.601
<i>- Where do I go for this meeting?
- Well, they want a description of myself.</i>

46:50.683 --> 46:54.313
<i>- Tactfully adjusted to favour me.
- Yes.</i>

46:54.395 --> 46:57.274
<i>They will send the time and place
from where I am to be</i>

46:57.356 --> 46:59.404
<i>"collected", as they put it.</i>

46:59.483 --> 47:02.862
<i>It's not our sort of thing,
but under the circumstances...</i>

47:02.945 --> 47:07.746
<i>- Sounds as if they're suspicious.
- No, no, no, not suspicious. Just discreet.</i>

47:07.825 --> 47:11.500
<i>There was no objection to my fee
of a thousand guineas.</i>

47:11.579 --> 47:15.755
<i>- Could their claim be genuine?
- Hard to say. Our methods are exacting.</i>

47:15.833 --> 47:20.930
<i>We never speak until we're absolutely
certain there's no error on our side or</i>

47:21.005 --> 47:24.726
<i>-forgery on anybody else's.
- I hope I live up to your high standards.</i>

47:24.800 --> 47:30.057
<i>One helpful physical point may be that the
real de Bleuchamps are without ear lobes.</i>

47:30.139 --> 47:33.643
<i>It's not the sort of thing we rely on,
but it could help.</i>

47:33.726 --> 47:36.479
<i>- No ear lobes.
- Invite him to Augsburg.</i>

47:36.562 --> 47:39.736
<i>The de Bleuchamps have been
coming from there for generations.</i>

47:39.815 --> 47:42.819
<i>Yes, I'd like to get him
away from Switzerland.</i>

47:43.277 --> 47:45.029
<i>{train whistle)</i>

47:52.787 --> 47:54.881
<i>{voice over tannoy)</i>

47:56.916 --> 47:59.544
<i>{singing)</i>

48:29.240 --> 48:31.993
<i>- Sir Hilary Bray, Baronet?
- The same, dear lady.</i>

48:32.076 --> 48:35.876
<i>I'm Fréulein Irma Bunt,
personal secretary to the Count.</i>

48:35.955 --> 48:40.176
<i>- Have you had a good journey?
- No, intolerable. I'm not a good traveller.</i>

48:40.251 --> 48:42.128
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

48:42.211 --> 48:44.885
<i>- Grunther will take your luggage.
- I can manage.</i>

48:44.964 --> 48:46.841
<i>- I take it.
- Oh, very well.</i>

48:46.924 --> 48:48.597
<i>You know Switzerland?</i>

48:48.676 --> 48:50.644
<i>- I'm afraid not, Fréulein...
- Bunt.</i>

48:50.719 --> 48:54.519
<i>Bunt. Interesting name for a genealogist.
Are you from a naval family?</i>

48:54.598 --> 48:56.066
<i>Naval?</i>

48:56.142 --> 49:00.067
<i>It's a nautical term, you see, meaning
the baggy or swollen parts of a sail.</i>

49:00.146 --> 49:02.649
<i>- Nothing personal, of course.
- Interesting.</i>

49:02.731 --> 49:05.200
<i>- You speak German?
- I'm afraid not.</i>

49:05.276 --> 49:07.529
<i>- French?
- A little. Where are we off to?</i>

49:07.611 --> 49:09.864
<i>You will not be disappointed. Please?</i>

49:13.742 --> 49:16.086
<i>Like the bugs in the rug, yes?</i>

49:16.162 --> 49:19.086
<i>- You are comfortable?
- Yes, indeed, Fréulein.</i>

49:19.165 --> 49:21.884
<i>- Your kindness is quite overwhelming.
- Good.</i>

49:51.030 --> 49:53.124
<i>{G ru nth er) Hup! KQn7rn!</i>

49:58.954 --> 50:01.252
<i>Komm. Komm. Hop!</i>

50:03.501 --> 50:05.595
<i>So, we are halfway.</i>

50:05.669 --> 50:07.546
<i>Now we will have a little flight.</i>

50:07.630 --> 50:11.260
<i>- I've never been in one of these before.
- You must your pipe knock off.</i>

50:11.342 --> 50:13.436
<i>Knock out, you mean?</i>

50:13.969 --> 50:15.846
<i>I hope.</i>

50:15.930 --> 50:20.276
<i>-{Bunt) Mind your head, Sir Hilary.
- Please fasten your safety belt.</i>

50:20.351 --> 50:22.399
<i>{engine whirs)</i>

50:27.650 --> 50:29.948
<i>Now up into the Alps.</i>

51:12.987 --> 51:15.706
<i>That is avalanche damage.</i>

51:36.885 --> 51:39.889
<i>You enjoy the skiing
or the bobsleigh perhaps?</i>

51:39.972 --> 51:42.145
<i>I'm not a sporting man, Fréulein.</i>

51:42.850 --> 51:44.352
<i>Even when I'm at my best.</i>

51:45.769 --> 51:47.863
<i>Do you feel the airsickness?</i>

52:06.790 --> 52:11.796
<i>Up to there is for the public, and
from here upwards it is strictly private.</i>

52:11.879 --> 52:14.098
<i>No one, no one at all</i>

52:14.173 --> 52:17.302
<i>may come through
without permission from the Count.</i>

52:17.760 --> 52:22.357
<i>There is the Bleuchamp Institute
for allergy research.</i>

52:23.766 --> 52:26.519
<i>- What kind of allergies?
- All of them.</i>

52:26.602 --> 52:30.823
<i>Like the hay fever,
or the sickness caused by the oysters,</i>

52:30.898 --> 52:33.071
<i>or inability to eat meat.</i>

52:33.150 --> 52:35.278
<i>The Count is a specialist in this field.</i>

52:44.411 --> 52:48.416
<i>- I'll be glad to get my feet on the ground
- Not ground. Ice.</i>

53:24.243 --> 53:27.372
<i>Fréulein, I should warn you,
guns make me very nervous.</i>

53:27.454 --> 53:30.628
<i>They're to keep away the spies
from the chemical companies.</i>

53:30.708 --> 53:34.212
<i>Many times already
they have tried to steal our discoveries.</i>

53:34.294 --> 53:36.888
<i>Yes, we live in a world
of avarice and deceit.</i>

53:36.964 --> 53:39.843
<i>- Here, at least, there's no avarice.
- Really?</i>

53:39.925 --> 53:43.520
<i>The Bleuchamp Institute
is not for profit, Sir Hilary.</i>

53:44.805 --> 53:47.479
<i>The Count does his work
for the sake of mankind.</i>

53:47.558 --> 53:49.435
<i>Mm, I'm very happy to hear it.</i>

53:49.518 --> 53:52.522
<i>He wants to leave his mark
on the entire world.</i>

53:52.604 --> 53:55.528
<i>- Characteristic ambition.
- Characteristic?</i>

53:55.607 --> 53:57.701
<i>- Of a true humanitarian.
- Ah!</i>

53:58.318 --> 54:01.117
<i>Formerly it was a sports club,
open to the public.</i>

54:01.196 --> 54:06.123
<i>Now it belongs to the Count,
who has given it to scientific research.</i>

54:06.201 --> 54:09.000
<i>Josef, Sir Hilary Bray
will take number four.</i>

54:09.079 --> 54:13.300
<i>I will show you there after Grunther
has taken you for a medical examination.</i>

54:13.375 --> 54:17.801
<i>- I'm quite all right now.
- You are our honoured guest, Sir Hilary.</i>

54:17.880 --> 54:20.508
<i>And after your experience
in the helicopter,</i>

54:20.591 --> 54:23.219
<i>we must make sure
that you are well again.</i>

54:23.302 --> 54:27.102
<i>- Grunther, take Sir Hilary to Dr von Sant.
- Ja, Fréulein.</i>

54:33.395 --> 54:34.692
<i>Direktor, bitte.</i>

54:34.772 --> 54:36.365
<i>{phone rings)</i>

54:38.609 --> 54:40.703
<i>- Yes?
- Der Englénder ist gekommen.</i>

54:40.778 --> 54:43.531
<i>- Provide him with the usual comforts.
- Ja.</i>

54:44.656 --> 54:46.750
<i>You have ten minutes.</i>

54:46.825 --> 54:49.578
<i>- And then take them to number four.
- Ja.</i>

54:55.334 --> 54:58.759
<i>If you wish anything for your comfort,
you must ring this.</i>

54:58.879 --> 54:59.926
<i>{beeping)</i>

55:00.047 --> 55:03.267
<i>- And the attendant will come.
- Very considerate. Thank you.</i>

55:03.383 --> 55:06.387
<i>You must also ring for him
to open the door</i>

55:06.512 --> 55:09.561
<i>-when you wish to leave.
- A complicated arrangement.</i>

55:09.681 --> 55:11.934
<i>To stop patients leaving their rooms</i>

55:12.059 --> 55:15.063
<i>and disturbing each other
when they should be resting.</i>

55:15.187 --> 55:18.566
<i>The Count believes very strongly
in undisturbed rest.</i>

55:18.690 --> 55:21.910
<i>Prudent fellow. When can I see him?
We have a lot to discuss.</i>

55:22.027 --> 55:24.655
<i>He will send for you, Sir Hilary,
when he's ready.</i>

55:24.738 --> 55:28.618
<i>Meanwhile, I should like you to join me
in the Alpine room before dinner.</i>

55:29.910 --> 55:31.833
<i>- Alpine room?
- Yes.</i>

55:31.912 --> 55:34.711
<i>Grunther will come for you.
Shall we say seven?</i>

55:34.790 --> 55:36.258
<i>Thank you.</i>

56:19.668 --> 56:21.796
<i>{helicopter engine)</i>

57:20.896 --> 57:23.024
<i>Fréulein Bunt will receive you.</i>

57:26.526 --> 57:28.574
<i>{dice rolling)</i>

57:34.076 --> 57:35.999
<i>{laughing)</i>

57:50.384 --> 57:52.182
<i>Tomato juice with lots of lemon.</i>

57:52.260 --> 57:53.386
<i>Hm-hm!</i>

57:56.848 --> 58:00.978
<i>Ah, Sir Hilary!
Please, come to meet our patients.</i>

58:01.061 --> 58:04.110
<i>Ladies, this is Sir Hilary Bray, Baronet.</i>

58:04.231 --> 58:06.984
<i>- How do you do?
- He's a famous genealogist.</i>

58:07.067 --> 58:10.446
<i>- You will have a drink, yes?
- Please, come and sit down.</i>

58:10.570 --> 58:12.038
<i>How do you do?</i>

58:12.114 --> 58:13.787
<i>Thank you.</i>

58:13.907 --> 58:16.581
<i>- What is a baronet?
- It's a kind of inferior baron.</i>

58:16.702 --> 58:18.921
<i>- Oh, how disappointing.
- Well, er...</i>

58:19.037 --> 58:21.916
<i>Oh, I don't mean you're inferior,
I mean the title is.</i>

58:22.040 --> 58:24.839
<i>Yes, but what's a gynae... genealogist?
What is that?</i>

58:24.918 --> 58:29.424
<i>- Pommy word for an old people's doctor.
- Ah! So he's here to cure Fréulein Bunt.</i>

58:29.548 --> 58:32.051
<i>Watch out. She has ears like an elephant.</i>

58:32.134 --> 58:36.389
<i>- What will you drink, sir?
- Malt whisky and branch water, please.</i>

58:36.471 --> 58:39.145
<i>I'm sorry I was so rude
about what a baronet is.</i>

58:39.266 --> 58:41.769
<i>You gave a very accurate description.</i>

58:42.436 --> 58:44.939
<i>- Sir.
- Thank you.</i>

58:45.731 --> 58:47.904
<i>It's a treat having a man here for once.</i>

58:47.983 --> 58:52.489
<i>- Er, you mean there aren't any others?
- Only the staff, and you can't count them.</i>

58:52.612 --> 58:54.990
<i>We will not discuss affairs of the clinic.</i>

58:55.115 --> 58:58.039
<i>But what is a genealogist?
Will nobody tell me?</i>

58:58.118 --> 59:00.871
<i>- It would be a pleasure to tell you.
- Well?</i>

59:00.954 --> 59:03.878
<i>Genealogy is all about
ancestors and families.</i>

59:03.957 --> 59:07.302
<i>I mean, it could easily be
that any one of you here</i>

59:07.419 --> 59:09.467
<i>is related to a royal house.</i>

59:09.588 --> 59:12.512
<i>If only we could go back
far enough to find out.</i>

59:12.632 --> 59:14.259
<i>If you tell me your names...</i>

59:14.342 --> 59:17.642
<i>We do not use surnames here.
It is a rule of the clinic.</i>

59:17.763 --> 59:20.016
<i>Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know that.</i>

59:20.640 --> 59:22.984
<i>Come, it's time for dinner.</i>

59:23.101 --> 59:27.072
<i>Our schedule is rather strict.
So is our diet.</i>

59:27.147 --> 59:30.697
<i>Sir Hilary, if you would sit there,
between Helen and Ruby.</i>

59:30.817 --> 59:33.946
<i>{Bond) I'm afraid I've never had
much to do with young ladies.</i>

59:34.029 --> 59:36.748
<i>I have ordered you a steak "Piz Gloria".</i>

59:36.823 --> 59:40.168
<i>- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you. I'm sure I will.</i>

59:47.334 --> 59:51.134
<i>- Are you here for Christmas, Sir Hilary?
- Er, well, I might be.</i>

59:51.213 --> 59:55.343
<i>- Oh, good! Then we can have a party.
- That sort of thing's not quite in my line.</i>

59:55.967 --> 59:57.594
<i>Delicious!</i>

59:57.677 --> 01:00:00.556
<i>I used to hate chicken.
Used to make me break out.</i>

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.024
<i>It was all over.
You'd be surprised where.</i>

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:07.191
<i>- Potatoes did it to me. Now I adore them.
- No medical histories, please.</i>

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:15.325
<i>Girls, I'm sure Sir Hilary would like to tell
us about the College of Arms in London.</i>

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:17.872
<i>Go on, Sir Hilary, please tell us.</i>

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:21.539
<i>- If you'd really enjoy that.
-{girls) Please. Yes!</i>

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.412
<i>Would you?</i>

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:27.045
<i>- Fascinating!
- Tell us all about it.</i>

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.634
<i>The Herald's College,
or College of Arms,</i>

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:32.963
<i>consists of 13 members
of the royal household,</i>

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:36.641
<i>appointed by the sovereign
to run armorial, genealogical,</i>

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:40.311
<i>-ceremonial and other matters.
-{women) Mm-hm.</i>

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:43.106
<i>The 13 members
are divided into three categories:</i>

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:47.186
<i>kings, heralds and pursuivants.</i>

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:50.398
<i>Their titles and offices
are of great antiquity.</i>

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:56.745
<i>...when I tell you the first Clarenceux,
King-of-Arms, was created in 1334</i>

01:00:57.362 --> 01:01:01.287
<i>and the first Somerset herald in 1448.</i>

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:07.173
<i>Now, when we authorise a coat of arms,
it can include all sorts of funny things.</i>

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:11.468
<i>Crescent moons, portcullises,
beasts couchant and rampant,</i>

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:13.428
<i>bars, bezants...</i>

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.422
<i>Please, what is bezant?</i>

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:18.474
<i>Gold balls.</i>

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:24.314
<i>I brought a book on the subject. There's
a picture of my own coat of arms,</i>

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.559
<i>which includes four of them,</i>

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:28.359
<i>{women gasp)</i>

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:30.563
<i>if you'd care to see them.</i>

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:32.773
<i>I'd love to. I'm in room...</i>

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:38.246
<i>No, no! He will give the book to me.
I will pass it to everyone in turn.</i>

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:43.455
<i>- It is fairer like that, yes?
- Of course. If you think so, Fréulein.</i>

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.595
<i>Is anything the matter, Sir Hilary?</i>

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:04.434
<i>Just a slight stiffness coming on
in the shoulder.</i>

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:07.015
<i>Due to the altitude, no doubt.</i>

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.902
<i>Der Graf will ihn jetzt sprechen.</i>

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:13.230
<i>The Count will see you now.</i>

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.816
<i>Thank you. Please excuse me, ladies.</i>

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:22.322
<i>May all your allergies be swiftly cured.</i>

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.830
<i>{woman) What a nice man!</i>

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:29.000
<i>{woman #2) Sweet!</i>

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:34.176
<i>Of course, I know what he's allergic to.</i>

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.004
<i>Bezants.</i>

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:41.641
<i>{bell)</i>

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.535
<i>{high-pitched buzz)</i>

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.163
<i>Antisepsis.</i>

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:14.249
<i>{bleeping)</i>

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.686
<i>Please wait here.</i>

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:46.907
<i>{high-pitched buzz)</i>

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.375
<i>- Good evening, Sir Hilary.
- Good evening.</i>

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.583
<i>Balthazar, Count de Bleuchamp.</i>

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.885
<i>If you'll forgive me,
that's what I'm here to find out.</i>

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.964
<i>To confirm, Sir Hilary.
There can be no doubt of the truth.</i>

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.715
<i>Please, sit down.</i>

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:07.098
<i>If there were no doubt,
the college would not have sent me.</i>

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:11.439
<i>Well, since you are here,
I'll make everything very plain to you.</i>

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:16.812
<i>To begin with,
I was born without ear lobes.</i>

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:20.816
<i>A well-known congenital
distinction of Bleuchamp ancestry.</i>

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.945
<i>Like the Hapsburg lip,
or the hawknose of the Medicis.</i>

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.415
<i>Granted, but the fact
you're of de Bleuchamp ancestry</i>

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.743
<i>doesn't make you the reigning count.</i>

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:32.702
<i>I feel it in my blood and in my bones.</i>

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:35.756
<i>The college will require
more concrete proofs.</i>

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:38.049
<i>And it shall have them.</i>

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:43.381
<i>I have all the relevant documents:
title deeds, certificates of birth and death.</i>

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:46.057
<i>They'll be sent to your room
for authentication.</i>

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:49.932
<i>And you've only to ask Fréulein Bunt
for anything at all you may require.</i>

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:53.390
<i>- Are you comfortable here?
- Yes, but puzzled by your clinic.</i>

01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:58.946
<i>Well, the methods of the great pioneers
have often puzzled conventional minds.</i>

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:03.321
<i>I have devised a cure for allergies
which depends on holding</i>

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:07.287
<i>an unusual and rather delicate
psychological balance.</i>

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:10.832
<i>So, you see, I must impose
special conditions on my patients.</i>

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:13.668
<i>And, erm, your laboratories?</i>

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:16.880
<i>The cure is not entirely
psychological, Sir Hilary.</i>

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.044
<i>There are vaccines to be prepared.</i>

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.715
<i>Vaccines which must be modified
to suit each individual case.</i>

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.713
<i>So, you see, I'm a very busy man.</i>

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:27.967
<i>I might not be able to spare you
as much time as I might wish.</i>

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:32.350
<i>If you wish to be confirmed as the Count,
you must give me some of your time.</i>

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:35.940
<i>I need details of living relatives,
your parents and grandparents.</i>

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:39.861
<i>- The documents you will see...
- Can answer many questions, but not all.</i>

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:41.605
<i>Oh, one more thing.</i>

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:45.283
<i>- Could you accompany me to Augsburg?
- Augsburg?</i>

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.827
<i>The ancestral home
of the de Bleuchamp family.</i>

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:52.578
<i>There are notable Bleuchamp tombs, and
important records in the city archives.</i>

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:55.168
<i>If you yourself were there to assist...</i>

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.462
<i>That may not be convenient
for some time.</i>

01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:00.211
<i>But I'm determined
my title shall be recognised.</i>

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:04.381
<i>- Proceed with your preliminary research.
- I'll be happy to start straightaway.</i>

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.511
<i>Thank you, Herr Grunther.</i>

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:44.604
<i>{Fréulein Bunt) ...al/e eingeschlossen
sind. Der Gast darf nicht gestért werden.</i>

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:48.486
<i>Du hast zwar nichts gefunden,
aber bleib wachsam.</i>

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.368
<i>- Sir Hilary!
- Shh...</i>

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.707
<i>{whispers) I've brought you the book.</i>

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:43.249
<i>- The illustrated book?
- No, don't turn it on.</i>

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:46.497
<i>- I want to see the pictures.
- But you're a picture yourself.</i>

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:49.084
<i>And twice as lovely in the firelight.</i>

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:52.428
<i>You are funny
at pretending not to like girls.</i>

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.674
<i>Well, I don't usually, but you're not usual.</i>

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:59.769
<i>That lipstick was an inspiration.
So are you.</i>

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.934
<i>Oh, Sir Hilary!</i>

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:05.020
<i>Call me Hilly.</i>

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.725
<i>Hilly.</i>

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:11.732
<i>- What's your name?
- Ruby Bartlett, from Lancashire.</i>

01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:14.450
<i>- Morecambe Bay actually.
- How did you get here?</i>

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:18.287
<i>Do we have to talk about that now?</i>

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.380
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:37.386
<i>{laughing) It's true!</i>

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:46.433
<i>How did you get here?</i>

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.228
<i>I had this awful allergy about chickens.</i>

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:55.780
<i>My family's got a chicken farm and every
time I did something on it, I nearly died.</i>

01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:00.451
<i>The specialist said there was a wonderful
Swiss clinic where they cured you free</i>

01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.824
<i>because they were researching.</i>

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.165
<i>Go on.</i>

01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:09.584
<i>- No, about the clinic, I mean.
- Oh!</i>

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:14.507
<i>Well, the specialist had me
meet Fréulein Bunt in London</i>

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:17.471
<i>and she said I had
a very interesting case.</i>

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.307
<i>How right she was.</i>

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.348
<i>Oh, Hilly!</i>

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.516
<i>-{alarm)
- Oh, bother!</i>

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:27.019
<i>No, Hilly.</i>

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.521
<i>It's part of the cure.</i>

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.484
<i>Cassette number seven.</i>

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:46.493
<i>Number eight.</i>

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:53.466
<i>{Blofeld) Do you remember
when you first came here,</i>

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.464
<i>how you hated chickens?</i>

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.463
<i>How you were sick
when you even saw one?</i>

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:04.516
<i>But all that is over now,
for! have shown you how foolish it was</i>

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.888
<i>And your cure is nearly done.</i>

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:10.104
<i>I have taught you to love chickens.</i>

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:13.528
<i>To love their ﬂesh, their voice.</i>

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:16.231
<i>Yes, your cure is nearly done.</i>

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.735
<i>- And soon you will go home
- Ruby!</i>

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:22.487
<i>- To look after the chickens,
- Ruby, wake up!</i>

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.664
<i>Which you love so much.</i>

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:27.959
<i>You do love me just a little,
don't you, Hilly?</i>

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:29.286
<i>Ruby?</i>

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:33.089
<i>I must teach you
how to give them special care</i>

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:35.841
<i>I will tell you what to do.</i>

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:38.716
<i>- Ruby, wake up!
-/ will tell you when.</i>

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.930
<i>I will tell you how.</i>

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:44.767
<i>And after you've done what I teach you,</i>

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.554
<i>you will forget it for ever.</i>

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.897
<i>For ever.</i>

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.039
<i>Hilly, you old devil.</i>

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:20.921
<i>It is me, yes?</i>

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.718
<i>Quite undeniably, yes.</i>

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.138
<i>How did you get out?</i>

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.803
<i>With a fingernail file.</i>

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.555
<i>It's so easy!</i>

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:33.107
<i>Mm, I wouldn't know.</i>

01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:37.941
<i>I come to see the book.
The pictures, yes?</i>

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:40.815
<i>Oh, jolly good idea.
Now, where did I put it?</i>

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.069
<i>Mm, I had it a few moments ago.</i>

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:47.288
<i>- Perhaps if we turn on the light.
- No!</i>

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.333
<i>You're a picture yourself.</i>

01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:52.952
<i>And twice as lovely in the firelight.</i>

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.751
<i>- But, Sir Hilary...
- Hilly.</i>

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:58.549
<i>But I think you do not like girls, Hilly.</i>

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.594
<i>Usually I don't, but you're not usual.</i>

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:05.966
<i>Coming here like this
was an inspiration, and so are you.</i>

01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:07.974
<i>Mmm!</i>

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.436
<i>- You'll need to be.
- What you say?</i>

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:14.357
<i>I said a miracle our meeting like this.
I don't even know your name.</i>

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:17.647
<i>I tell you all about myself later.</i>

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:20.780
<i>In the morning.</i>

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:32.204
<i>{music on radio)</i>

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.313
<i>Hey!</i>

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:04.273
<i>What about a lift to the top?</i>

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.780
<i>It is not permitted. All is private.</i>

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:11.239
<i>Surely there's a restaurant, a sports club
up there. I've seen them advertised.</i>

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:15.164
<i>- It's all closed down.
- Since when? I've seen them advertised.</i>

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:18.416
<i>You are mistaken, sir.
For many weeks now they are finished.</i>

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.631
<i>I'd still like to get to the top.</i>

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:24.506
<i>From here upwards now is forbidden!
Private! Closed!</i>

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.381
<i>All right.</i>

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:54.407
<i>{woman) Hey!</i>

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.581
<i>It's my go now.</i>

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:00.751
<i>Let go! {laughing)</i>

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.587
<i>- Sir Hilary!
- Good morning.</i>

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:07.884
<i>Good morning, Sir Hilary.
Your stiffness of last night, it is all gone?</i>

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:11.800
<i>- For the time being.
- Then come and do curling with us.</i>

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:14.177
<i>- Won't it be frightfully energetic?
- No.</i>

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.604
<i>-{Bunt) We will show you.
- You can teach me.</i>

01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.572
<i>Come on, Sir Hilary.</i>

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.779
<i>We expect great things of you.</i>

01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:37.746
<i>{laughing)</i>

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:42.126
<i>- We're leaving very soon. I must see you.
- Eight o'clock tonight.</i>

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.628
<i>{crows cawing)</i>

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.353
<i>And the man was alone?</i>

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:07.484
<i>- Ah! Good morning, ladies.
-{all) Morning!</i>

01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:10.529
<i>Good morning, Sir Hilary,
and how's your research?</i>

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:13.402
<i>Riveting. And very promising too.</i>

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:16.205
<i>{man) I've never heard
anything so ridiculous.</i>

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:18.575
<i>Since when is climbing
a criminal of fence?</i>

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:24.130
<i>- Excuse me. Piz Gloria's private property.
- The whole bloody Alp?! Ridiculous!</i>

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:28.005
<i>There are many signs,
and my servant warned you at the station.</i>

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:30.086
<i>Your throw, I think it is.</i>

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:33.343
<i>No, Fraulein! I had my throw.
Made a mess of it, I'm afraid.</i>

01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:35.717
<i>That didn't count. You can throw again.</i>

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:38.060
<i>- Yes! Go on!
- Very civil of you.</i>

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:40.350
<i>That doesn't entitle you to shoot at me.</i>

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:44.351
<i>- Who the hell are you, anyway?
- I am the director of this institute.</i>

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.693
<i>Oh!</i>

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:52.909
<i>You'll be sent down by cable car
and you will not trouble us again.</i>

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:54.951
<i>What about my clobber? My belongings?</i>

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.576
<i>- They'll be sent down later.
- But they're mine!</i>

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:01.326
<i>We have certain rules
which must be observed.</i>

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:07.874
<i>- The authorities'll hear about this.
- Good day, sir.</i>

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:14.430
<i>- Director, or Count, as I think I can say.
- Yes?</i>

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.180
<i>I'd like the afternoon off,
so if the cable car's going down...</i>

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:20.387
<i>But you've already had the morning off.</i>

01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:24.482
<i>I must have some fresh air.
Your ancestors are very hard work.</i>

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:27.106
<i>And the College of Arms
is being very well paid.</i>

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.983
<i>- Well, if you put it like that...
- I do put it like that.</i>

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:33.942
<i>Let me show you what I've achieved,
then we can go to Augsburg.</i>

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:37.411
<i>Not over Christmas.
The archives will be closed, no?</i>

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:41.536
<i>Come, girls. Time for our massage.</i>

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:45.708
<i>{Bunt) Girls, that is
enough curling for today.</i>

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:47.914
<i>{murmurs of disappointment)</i>

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.798
<i>- I must see you tonight.
- Nine o'clock?</i>

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:57.473
<i>Ten?</i>

01:17:57.548 --> 01:17:59.642
<i>Well, back to work.</i>

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.932
<i>You've no idea how it's piling up.</i>

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:23.749
<i>Ruby? It's me.</i>

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:25.497
<i>Hilly.</i>

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:30.377
<i>- Hilly's so sad that Ruby's leaving.
-{giggling)</i>

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:32.333
<i>Has that old cow told you...</i>

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:35.093
<i>Fancy meeting you here, Fréulein!</i>

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.733
<i>Merry Christmas, 007.</i>

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:02.993
<i>- I'm Sir Hilary Bray.
- Oh, no, no, no, Mr Bond.</i>

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:08.124
<i>Respectable baronets from colleges
do not seduce female patients in clinics.</i>

01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:12.252
<i>On the other hand, they do get
their professional details right.</i>

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:15.505
<i>The Bleuchamp tombs
are not in the Augsburg Cathedral,</i>

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.382
<i>but in the St Anna Kirche.</i>

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:19.968
<i>Sir Hilary Bray would have known.</i>

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.471
<i>A small slip.</i>

01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:25.428
<i>Takes more than a few props
to turn 007 into a herald.</i>

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:29.186
<i>It'll take more than cutting off
your ear lobes to turn you into a count.</i>

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.770
<i>I may yet surprise you, but I'm afraid
that you have no surprises left for me.</i>

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:36.696
<i>I know all about your mission, Mr Bond.</i>

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.399
<i>Your colleague:</i>

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:43.738
<i>such a keen climber, such a brilliant
conversationalist. Before he left us.</i>

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:47.161
<i>- He reported where I am.
- I doubt that.</i>

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:49.585
<i>In any case,
no one's coming to your rescue.</i>

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:55.042
<i>In a few hours, the United Nations
will receive our yuletide greetings.</i>

01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:59.550
<i>The information that I now possess
the scientific means to control,</i>

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:02.757
<i>or to destroy, the economy
of the whole world.</i>

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.014
<i>People will have more important things
to think of than you.</i>

01:20:06.093 --> 01:20:08.596
<i>- If they believe your threat.
-{chuckles)</i>

01:20:09.096 --> 01:20:13.067
<i>Oh, they will. In any case,
I have prepared a demonstration.</i>

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.817
<i>Remember that disagreeable outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease</i>

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:18.989
<i>in England last summer?</i>

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:26.121
<i>I shall instruct them, in very convincing
terms, exactly how I arranged that.</i>

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:29.120
<i>And my capacity has improved since.</i>

<i>Allergy vaccines?</i>

<i>Bacteria.</i>

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:38.714
<i>- Bacteriological warfare.
- With a difference.</i>

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:41.215
<i>Our great breakthrough
since last summer</i>

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:45.266
<i>has been the confection
of a certain virus omega.</i>

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:49.603
<i>- Infertility.
- Total infertility. In plants and animals.</i>

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:54.434
<i>Not just disease in a few herds, Mr Bond
or the loss of a single crop.</i>

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:59.317
<i>But the destruction of a whole strain
for ever, throughout an entire continent.</i>

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:03.151
<i>If my demands are not met,
I'll proceed with the extinction</i>

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:06.533
<i>of whole species of cereals
and livestock all over the world.</i>

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.952
<i>Including, I suppose, the human race.</i>

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:12.330
<i>I don't think, do you, Mr Bond,</i>

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.628
<i>the UN will let it come to that.</i>

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:19.459
<i>Not after their scientists analyse a sample
of virus omega they have received.</i>

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.635
<i>Epidemics of sterility.</i>

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.590
<i>Nothing is born.
No seed even begins to sprout.</i>

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.139
<i>- They'll find an antidote.
- Of course!</i>

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.391
<i>If I give them enough time.</i>

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:36.317
<i>They'll have time. Once they're warned,
you'll have problems dispensing the stuff.</i>

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:39.111
<i>That problem has already been solved.</i>

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:43.191
<i>I have been training
my own special "angels of death".</i>

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:47.153
<i>- Those girls?
- Those girls. And many others like them.</i>

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:49.872
<i>But exactly how?</i>

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.367
<i>That will remain my secret.</i>

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.084
<i>And how many millions do you
want for your services this time?</i>

01:21:58.163 --> 01:21:59.631
<i>This time?</i>

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:03.461
<i>This time the price is different. You'll be
more amused when you know what.</i>

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:06.047
<i>Meanwhile, I will
keep you here as my guest.</i>

01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:09.350
<i>You'll be useful in helping
to convince the authorities</i>

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:11.598
<i>that I mean what I say</i>

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:13.771

<i>Every year, dozens of amateur climbers,

<i>{tuts) Dear, dear me.</i>

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:58.649
<i>Now, now, now, now, Mr Bond,
you must learn to be absolutely calm</i>

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:01.694

- Oh, no!</i>

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:06.417
<i>It is more fun
to open them all together, yes?</i>

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.344

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:43.981
<i>How do we get out?</i>

01:46:55.159 --> 01:46:57.036
<i>Knock him out of the way!</i>

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:08.593
<i>I hope my big end will stand up to this.</i>

01:47:12.843 --> 01:47:14.516
<i>{brakes screech}</i>

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.192
<i>James! How do we get out?</i>

01:47:45.834 --> 01:47:47.211
<i>{gunshot}</i>

01:48:03.894 --> 01:48:06.818
<i>- We can get out there.
- If you say so.</i>

01:48:06.897 --> 01:48:09.025
<i>{ambulance siren}</i>

01:48:11.986 --> 01:48:13.408
<i>{screaming}</i>

01:48:15.489 --> 01:48:17.366
<i>Bremsen Sie doch!</i>

01:48:19.535 --> 01:48:22.414
<i>{laughs} We didn't even stop for the prize!</i>

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.628
<i>{Bond} I said a crowd
would discourage them.</i>

01:48:29.712 --> 01:48:31.840
<i>{wind howling}</i>

01:48:45.853 --> 01:48:47.947
<i>{Tracy} Oh, that's all we need now!</i>

01:48:59.575 --> 01:49:02.078
<i>Pull in there.</i>

01:49:12.129 --> 01:49:14.302
<i>Keep moving. I'll open the doors.</i>

01:49:33.275 --> 01:49:35.903
<i>Sorry about the accommodation,
Contessa.</i>

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:38.455
<i>We should have rung ahead and booked.</i>

01:49:39.281 --> 01:49:41.329
<i>If only I'd got through to London.</i>

01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:43.669
<i>- You'll get another chance.
- But when?</i>

01:49:43.786 --> 01:49:45.333
<i>{banging}</i>

01:50:05.349 --> 01:50:08.774
<i>Let's get some rest.
We'll push on as soon as we can.</i>

01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:10.946
<i>At least it's dry.</i>

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:15.367
<i>{wind howling}</i>

01:50:18.987 --> 01:50:21.035
<i>{doors creaking}</i>

01:50:36.797 --> 01:50:39.141
<i>What really went on up there, James?</i>

01:50:40.217 --> 01:50:43.687
<i>Mm-mm. Her Majesty's Secret Service
is still my job.</i>

01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:49.394
<i>But there's nothing you can do
about your job at the moment, is there?</i>

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:51.069
<i>{grunts}</i>

01:50:56.567 --> 01:50:59.070
<i>Then why are you thinking about it now?</i>

01:51:00.904 --> 01:51:02.998
<i>I'm not.</i>

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:09.421
<i>I'm thinking about us.</i>

01:51:14.251 --> 01:51:19.257
<i>Tracy, an agent shouldn't be concerned
with anything but himself.</i>

01:51:22.384 --> 01:51:24.432
<i>I understand.</i>

01:51:24.887 --> 01:51:28.391
<i>- We'll just have to go on the way we are.
- No.</i>

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.898
<i>I'll have to find something else to do.</i>

01:51:35.022 --> 01:51:37.116
<i>Are you sure, James?</i>

01:51:39.776 --> 01:51:41.870
<i>I love you.</i>

01:51:42.279 --> 01:51:45.123
<i>I know I'll never find another girl like you.</i>

01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:49.787
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

01:52:00.923 --> 01:52:02.971
<i>D'you mean it?</i>

01:52:03.091 --> 01:52:04.559
<i>I mean it.</i>

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:20.659
<i>Mr and Mrs James Bond.</i>

01:52:21.652 --> 01:52:25.156
<i>Of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells.</i>

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.328
<i>Mm. How about Belgrave Square?</i>

01:52:27.908 --> 01:52:30.002
<i>Or the Via Veneto, Rome?</i>

01:52:30.452 --> 01:52:33.501
<i>Paris. Convenient for Le Touquet.</i>

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:36.299
<i>Monaco. Handy for the Rainiers.</i>

01:52:39.127 --> 01:52:41.846
<i>I wonder how much
they're asking for this place.</i>

01:52:41.922 --> 01:52:44.016
<i>{Tracy laughs}</i>

01:52:46.093 --> 01:52:49.017
<i>The proper time for this
is our wedding night.</i>

01:52:50.514 --> 01:52:52.687
<i>And that's my New Year's resolution.</i>

01:52:52.766 --> 01:52:55.690
<i>- Whatever you say, darling.
- And that is yours.</i>

01:53:01.858 --> 01:53:03.952
<i>Good night, Tracy.</i>

01:53:05.028 --> 01:53:07.156
<i>Good night, James.</i>

01:53:24.172 --> 01:53:27.221
<i>- Oh!
- It's not New Year yet!</i>

01:54:18.727 --> 01:54:20.775
<i>- James!
- Keep going!</i>

01:54:59.643 --> 01:55:01.737
<i>- Simple!
- Good girl!</i>

01:55:01.812 --> 01:55:03.655
<i>{Qunfi re}</i>

01:55:23.834 --> 01:55:25.507
<i>Argh!</i>

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:37.856
<i>He had lots of guts!</i>

01:55:45.856 --> 01:55:48.029
<i>{Blofeld} You three, keep going.</i>

01:56:31.026 --> 01:56:32.903
<i>Let's head for the trees!</i>

01:57:05.602 --> 01:57:08.105
<i>- James!
- Keep going!</i>

01:57:11.358 --> 01:57:13.031
<i>{Tracy screams}</i>

01:57:13.944 --> 01:57:16.117
<i>Tracy, cling on to me!</i>

01:58:07.163 --> 01:58:11.168
<i>A grave deep enough, I think,
to prevent even 007 from walking.</i>

01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:16.673
<i>Get the girl.</i>

01:58:44.159 --> 01:58:45.376
<i>{intercom}</i>

01:58:45.493 --> 01:58:48.838
<i>{Moneypenny} United Nations, sir.
Red scrambler.</i>

01:58:49.372 --> 01:58:51.500
<i>M here.</i>

01:58:55.128 --> 01:58:57.631
<i>Yes, we're standing by as instructed.</i>

01:58:59.799 --> 01:59:01.893
<i>I understand.</i>

01:59:03.887 --> 01:59:06.015
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

01:59:06.348 --> 01:59:08.396
<i>No decision has been announced yet.</i>

01:59:08.516 --> 01:59:13.568
<i>Of course, there's a total news blackout,
but my informant was very plain.</i>

01:59:13.688 --> 01:59:17.033
<i>- How plain, sir?
- They're going to buy Blofeld off.</i>

01:59:19.319 --> 01:59:21.413
<i>Sit down.</i>

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:24.745
<i>- And the price?
- Amnesty.</i>

01:59:24.866 --> 01:59:27.335
<i>A full pardon for all past crimes.</i>

01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:32.166
<i>Official recognition of his title
when he retires into private life</i>

01:59:32.248 --> 01:59:34.342
<i>as Count de Bleuchamp.</i>

01:59:35.585 --> 01:59:37.929
<i>He seems to set a great store by that.</i>

01:59:39.089 --> 01:59:41.183
<i>A very curious thing, snobbery.</i>

01:59:41.257 --> 01:59:43.180
<i>When will they conclude the deal?</i>

01:59:43.259 --> 01:59:46.763
<i>Blofeld wants a decision
by midnight the day after tomorrow.</i>

01:59:46.888 --> 01:59:50.518
<i>Sir, that gives us time
to get to Piz Gloria first -in force.</i>

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:53.194
<i>No, 007. My instructions are clear.</i>

01:59:53.269 --> 01:59:56.443
<i>Sir, destroy the institute
and Blofeld's virus with it.</i>

01:59:56.564 --> 01:59:58.783
<i>It's been rejected as too risky.</i>

01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:01.369
<i>Those girls.</i>

02:00:01.444 --> 02:00:04.118
<i>God knows how many, let alone where.</i>

02:00:04.239 --> 02:00:08.289
<i>Sir, if we destroy the centre of
communication that controls the girls,</i>

02:00:08.368 --> 02:00:10.211
<i>the girls can do nothing.</i>

02:00:10.286 --> 02:00:13.631
<i>I have my orders, 007.
You have yours. Forget it.</i>

02:00:13.707 --> 02:00:16.085
<i>And the girl who helped me
We just leave her?</i>

02:00:16.793 --> 02:00:20.468
<i>This department is not concerned
with your personal problems.</i>

02:00:20.588 --> 02:00:23.637
<i>This department owes her a debt.</i>

02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:26.477
<i>- She saved my life.
- Operation Bedlam is dead.</i>

02:00:28.471 --> 02:00:30.565
<i>- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.</i>

02:00:31.141 --> 02:00:33.235
<i>I understand.</i>

02:00:33.309 --> 02:00:34.731
<i>{rings}</i>

02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:38.065
<i>Your call to Marc Ange Draco,
Head of Draco Construction.</i>

02:00:38.148 --> 02:00:39.821
<i>- Hello, Draco.
- Who is it?</i>

02:00:39.941 --> 02:00:41.989
<i>- Bond. James Bond.
- Thank God, James.</i>

02:00:42.110 --> 02:00:46.616
<i>I'd like to interest you in a deal requiring
certain aerial activity to install equipment.</i>

02:00:53.621 --> 02:00:57.000
<i>Are you sure we're going to find Teresa
when we get up there?</i>

02:00:57.125 --> 02:01:00.755
<i>I'm pretty certain.
There's a good reason for going anyway.</i>

02:01:00.837 --> 02:01:03.181
<i>So you've explained. Quite a crusade.</i>

02:01:07.427 --> 02:01:09.521
<i>It is a time for celebration.</i>

02:01:10.263 --> 02:01:11.936
<i>Perhaps.</i>

02:01:12.015 --> 02:01:15.360
<i>- If they agree.
- They can do nothing else. You know it.</i>

02:01:15.477 --> 02:01:17.525
<i>And they know it.</i>

02:01:18.354 --> 02:01:22.450
<i>I shall be able to offer you
anything your heart could wish for.</i>

02:01:23.359 --> 02:01:25.453
<i>Paid for with how many lives?</i>

02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:29.704
<i>Oh, come now, Tracy,
don't be so proud.</i>

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.795
<i>Your own father's profession
is not entirely within the law.</i>

02:01:34.037 --> 02:01:38.417
<i>His brotherhood also have exotic ways
to keep it a close shot.</i>

02:01:40.376 --> 02:01:43.880
<i>{woman} Basie Approach calling
unidentified aircraft over Basie-</i>

02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:46.136
<i>You're flying in controlled airspace.</i>

02:01:46.216 --> 02:01:48.719
<i>We have no flight plan filed on you.</i>

02:01:48.843 --> 02:01:52.723
<i>I think some people
don't know we are crusaders.</i>

02:01:54.724 --> 02:01:57.944
<i>Now, if you're very, very nice to me,</i>

02:01:58.436 --> 02:02:00.530
<i>I could make you my countess.</i>

02:02:01.564 --> 02:02:03.658
<i>But I'm already a countess.</i>

02:02:04.275 --> 02:02:08.246
<i>Whereas if you displease me,
I can promise you a very different estate.</i>

02:02:08.321 --> 02:02:10.415
<i>- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?</i>

02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:13.164
<i>There is something on the radio
you should hear.</i>

02:02:14.202 --> 02:02:16.705
<i>- Excuse me.
- This is Ziirich Information</i>

02:02:16.788 --> 02:02:19.758
<i>calling unidentified aircraft, over.</i>

02:02:19.833 --> 02:02:23.463
<i>I repeat. This is Ziirich Information
calling unidentified aircraft...</i>

02:02:23.545 --> 02:02:27.721
<i>That helicopter is one of three.
None have answered air control.</i>

02:02:27.799 --> 02:02:30.848
<i>- And?
- There are suspect aircraft in the vicinity.</i>

02:02:30.927 --> 02:02:33.897
<i>Pilot's name and destination, over.</i>

02:02:34.597 --> 02:02:38.647
<i>Ziirich, this is Foxtrot Golf Sierra,
leading Red Cross helicopter flight.</i>

02:02:38.726 --> 02:02:43.482
<i>Carrying Red Cross medical supplies
to Italy. What's the trouble? Over.</i>

02:02:43.565 --> 02:02:47.536
<i>We have no record of your ﬂight plan
or registration, over.</i>

02:02:50.655 --> 02:02:54.626
<i>I repeat, we have no record
of your flight plan or registration, over.</i>

02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:59.047
<i>Then your registrations
must be out of date, over.</i>

02:02:59.122 --> 02:03:03.252
<i>Foxtrot Golf Sierra, this is Zurich
Information. Land at Ziirich and report.</i>

02:03:03.334 --> 02:03:06.838
<i>I say again,
land at Ziirich and report, over.</i>

02:03:06.921 --> 02:03:11.142
<i>Do you wish to commit murder?
I told you, this is a mercy flight</i>

02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:15.438
<i>carrying blood plasma
and emergency equipment</i>

02:03:15.513 --> 02:03:19.609
<i>for the victims
of the Italian flood disaster at Rovigo.</i>

02:03:20.393 --> 02:03:23.272
<i>I repeat, mercy flight!</i>

02:03:23.354 --> 02:03:25.027
<i>D'you understand me?</i>

02:03:26.065 --> 02:03:27.942
<i>- Golf Sierra?
- Yes?</i>

02:03:28.026 --> 02:03:30.779
<i>Ziirich. Very well, you may proceed, out.</i>

02:03:30.862 --> 02:03:32.910
<i>You see, it is nothing.</i>

02:03:32.989 --> 02:03:34.866
<i>That's settled it.</i>

02:03:34.949 --> 02:03:39.830
<i>In case one of us is delayed on the way
home, it's better to have a rendezvous.</i>

02:03:39.913 --> 02:03:43.668
<i>Before we start getting sentimental,
I think we're being followed.</i>

02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:45.218
<i>I've been thinking</i>

02:03:45.293 --> 02:03:47.387
<i>about your proposition.</i>

02:03:48.838 --> 02:03:51.591
<i>Please tell me more.</i>

02:03:51.674 --> 02:03:55.304
<i>This is military air control.
There is no record of your mission.</i>

02:03:55.386 --> 02:03:57.263
<i>Alter course to Ziirich and land.</i>

02:03:57.347 --> 02:04:00.066
<i>Fighters have been dispatched
to intercept you.</i>

02:04:00.141 --> 02:04:03.862
<i>I suggest you check your records again.</i>

02:04:03.937 --> 02:04:05.610
<i>Carefully. Over.</i>

02:04:05.688 --> 02:04:08.282
<i>I repeat, return to Zrjirfch and land, over.</i>

02:04:08.358 --> 02:04:11.953
<i>Check with Geneva.
Check with the Red Cross in Geneva.</i>

02:04:13.196 --> 02:04:15.745
<i>Meanwhile, call off your air force.</i>

02:04:15.823 --> 02:04:17.917
<i>It is making my passengers sick.</i>

02:04:17.992 --> 02:04:21.087
<i>Foxtrot Golf Sierra,
you are carrying passengers?</i>

02:04:21.162 --> 02:04:23.256
<i>Of course I am.</i>

02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:27.795
<i>Distinguished representatives
of the world press.</i>

02:04:28.711 --> 02:04:31.635
<i>They've had enough
of your nonsense. So have I.</i>

02:04:31.714 --> 02:04:33.808
<i>Over and out.</i>

02:04:38.262 --> 02:04:40.310
<i>There's a lot more to tell,</i>

02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:42.939
<i>but there'll be plenty of time later.</i>

02:04:43.059 --> 02:04:45.562
<i>- Take me to the Alpine room.
- Oh?</i>

02:04:45.645 --> 02:04:47.522
<i>Are you unhappy here?</i>

02:04:47.605 --> 02:04:50.734
<i>Oh, I want to see the dawn.</i>

02:04:50.817 --> 02:04:54.572
<i>Ah, so poetic a pleasure.</i>

02:04:55.488 --> 02:04:58.958
<i>What were all the world's charms
to mighty Paris</i>

02:04:59.033 --> 02:05:02.708
<i>when he found that first dawn
in the arms of his Helen?</i>

02:05:04.414 --> 02:05:08.169
<i>And when do you expect the signal
accepting your terms?</i>

02:05:08.251 --> 02:05:11.095
<i>Any time before midnight tonight.</i>

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:16.059
<i>"Thy dawn, O Master of the World,
thy dawn.</i>

02:05:16.134 --> 02:05:19.138
<i>"For thee the sunlight
creeps across the lawn.</i>

02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:22.474
<i>"For thee the ships

02:05:26.978 --> 02:05:29.606
<i>"For thee the hammer on the anvil rings.</i>

02:05:30.523 --> 02:05:32.571
<i>"For thee</i>

<i>"the poet of beguilement sings."</i>

02:05:42.035 --> 02:05:44.879
<i>- Helicopters!
- Get our positions covered!</i>

02:05:48.041 --> 02:05:49.918

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:09.644
<i>Urgh!</i>

02:08:25.156 --> 02:08:27.875
<i>- Tracy! Darling!
- Thank God, Teresa.</i>

02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:31.004
<i>James, wait!</i>

02:08:31.078 --> 02:08:34.082
<i>- Guns make me nervous.
- You've done your share.</i>

02:08:34.165 --> 02:08:36.259
<i>Get her to safety!</i>

02:08:41.172 --> 02:08:43.345
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

02:08:43.424 --> 02:08:44.676
<i>YOU.</i>

02:08:44.759 --> 02:08:47.478
<i>Get the circuits set up now. Let's go!</i>

02:08:51.182 --> 02:08:52.900
<i>Argh!</i>

02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:29.269
<i>- All points covered?
- Yes, sir.</i>

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.914
<i>- All set to blow?
- Fuse is set for exactly</i>

02:10:29.989 --> 02:10:33.584
<i>five minutes, ten seconds.
The place will be sealed off for ever.</i>

02:10:33.659 --> 02:10:36.708
<i>Will that give the Englishman
time to get out?</i>

02:10:36.787 --> 02:10:38.460
<i>He knows the schedule.</i>

02:10:49.967 --> 02:10:52.061
<i>- Where are you going?
- Where's James?</i>

02:10:52.136 --> 02:10:53.604
<i>He'll join us soon.</i>

02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:56.182
<i>- We can't leave him!
- He doesn't need you.</i>

02:10:56.265 --> 02:10:58.768
<i>- I will not go without him!
- You'll have to.</i>

02:11:00.478 --> 02:11:02.981
<i>Spare the rod and spoil the child, eh?</i>

02:11:13.449 --> 02:11:16.373
<i>Five, four, three,</i>

02:11:16.452 --> 02:11:17.749
<i>two, one.</i>

02:11:17.828 --> 02:11:18.875
<i>NOW!</i>

02:15:00.634 --> 02:15:02.102
<i>Ah!</i>

02:15:03.929 --> 02:15:05.431
<i>He's branched off!</i>

02:15:21.238 --> 02:15:23.081
<i>Ah! Oh!</i>

02:15:30.873 --> 02:15:33.672
<i>Never mind that!
Go and get the brandy, huh?</i>

02:15:34.335 --> 02:15:36.429
<i>Five-star Hennessy, of course.</i>

02:15:40.424 --> 02:15:41.425

<i>{all toast} Mr and Mrs James Bond!</i>

02:16:22.675 --> 02:16:24.973
<i>- Good luck, Teresa.
- Thank you.</i>

02:16:40.275 --> 02:16:42.369
<i>Anyway, it is a pleasure</i>

02:16:42.443 --> 02:16:46.290
<i>to meet the man who cost me
three of my best operators.</i>

02:16:46.365 --> 02:16:49.289
<i>Yes. November '64 -the bullion job.</i>

02:16:49.368 --> 02:16:52.371
<i>You even got away with
quite a chunk of the haul.</i>

02:16:52.454 --> 02:16:53.922
<i>Tell me, I've always</i>

02:16:53.996 --> 02:16:56.091
<i>{singing}</i>

02:16:59.585 --> 02:17:03.966
<i>Congratulations, 007. I must confess
I've sometimes thought you a little, erm...</i>

02:17:04.049 --> 02:17:07.849
<i>- Irresponsible?
- Exactly! That's the word. Thank you!</i>

02:17:07.928 --> 02:17:11.307
<i>- This time, my boy, I can't complain.
- Nor can I.</i>

02:17:13.433 --> 02:17:14.686
<i>- Teresa.
- Yes, Papa?</i>

02:17:14.768 --> 02:17:17.941
<i>Look, James, I know that
we haven't always exactly seen...</i>

02:17:18.021 --> 02:17:20.865
<i>Well, don't forget,
if there's anything you need...</i>

02:17:20.941 --> 02:17:24.491
<i>Thank you, but this time I have
the gadgets and I know how to use them.</i>

02:17:24.570 --> 02:17:26.447
<i>Au revoir.</i>

02:17:26.864 --> 02:17:30.869
<i>Remember, obey your husband
in all things. You promise me?</i>

02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:32.827
<i>But of course I will.</i>

02:17:32.911 --> 02:17:35.004
<i>As I always obeyed you.</i>

02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:39.885
<i>Of course.</i>

02:17:39.959 --> 02:17:42.133
<i>Well, James, lwish you luck.</i>

02:17:42.212 --> 02:17:44.931
<i>For the first and last time, remember?</i>

02:17:45.382 --> 02:17:47.055
<i>An old proverb.</i>

02:17:47.134 --> 02:17:50.728
<i>"Her price is far above rubies",
or even your million pounds.</i>

02:17:50.804 --> 02:17:55.809
<i>Teresa, just because you're Mrs Bond,
don't forget my birthday next year.</i>

02:17:55.893 --> 02:17:58.816
<i>- Have I ever?
- Both of you, or maybe all of you!</i>

02:18:00.397 --> 02:18:02.491
<i>Come on, James!</i>

02:18:03.650 --> 02:18:05.823
<i>Very happy. Be happy, my darling.</i>

02:18:07.404 --> 02:18:09.498
<i>Come on.</i>

02:18:09.573 --> 02:18:11.290
<i>On your way.</i>

02:18:11.366 --> 02:18:13.243
<i>- Au revoir.
- G ood bye!</i>

02:18:13.326 --> 02:18:15.204
<i>Drive carefully.</i>

<i>{repeated beeps of horn}</i>

02:18:26.465 --> 02:18:29.308
<i>Miss Moneypenny,
what would you do without me?</i>

02:18:29.384 --> 02:18:31.477
<i>I always cry at weddings.</i>

02:18:31.553 --> 02:18:34.647
<i>O07 never had any respect
for government property.</i>

02:18:34.723 --> 02:18:36.816
<i>{beeps horn}</i>

02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:42.022
<i>I haven't given you a wedding present yet.</i>

02:18:42.105 --> 02:18:43.982
<i>I had an idea about that.</i>

02:18:44.066 --> 02:18:46.443
<i>Three girls, three boys.</i>

02:18:46.527 --> 02:18:49.200
<i>- Pleased?
- Mm, not bad for a start.</i>

02:18:50.948 --> 02:18:54.201
<i>But, darling,
now we have all the time in the world.</i>

02:18:56.245 --> 02:18:57.871
<i>{car horn}</i>

02:18:59.414 --> 02:19:01.916
<i>-{cheering}
-{Tracy laughs}</i>

02:19:05.254 --> 02:19:06.927
<i>Say it with flowers!</i>

02:19:07.004 --> 02:19:10.179
<i>He's got a point, we do
look like an ad for a flower shop!</i>

02:19:10.259 --> 02:19:13.603
<i>And that reminds me,
I didn't even send you ﬂowers.</i>

02:19:16.932 --> 02:19:19.856
<i>Anyway, you have given me
a wedding present.</i>

02:19:20.477 --> 02:19:22.571
<i>The best I could have.</i>

02:19:22.728 --> 02:19:24.697
<i>A future.</i>

02:19:24.772 --> 02:19:26.867
<i>Mrs Bond, shut...</i>

02:19:27.609 --> 02:19:28.861
<i>...Up!</i>

02:19:28.943 --> 02:19:31.038
<i>And don't eat it all at once.</i>

02:19:32.155 --> 02:19:34.327
<i>- He loves me.
-Instinctively.</i>

02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:37.829
<i>- Infuriatingly.
-Intensely.</i>

02:19:37.911 --> 02:19:39.458
<i>In...</i>

02:19:39.538 --> 02:19:41.415
<i>- In...
- In? In?</i>

02:19:41.498 --> 02:19:43.592
<i>- In.
-Indubitably.</i>

02:19:45.794 --> 02:19:47.842
<i>First a boy, then a girl.</i>

02:19:56.763 --> 02:19:58.231
<i>It's Blofeld!</i>

02:20:00.517 --> 02:20:02.611
<i>It's Blofeld.</i>

02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:31.974
<i>It's all right.</i>

02:20:32.382 --> 02:20:35.636
<i>It's quite all right, really.
She's having a rest.</i>

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:40.357
<i>We'll be going on soon.</i>

02:20:46.521 --> 02:20:50.321
<i>There's no hurry, you see?
We have all the time in the world.</i>
