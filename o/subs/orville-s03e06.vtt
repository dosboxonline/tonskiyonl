-C'mon, one more!
-No, no, no. No, that's it.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.246
That's it, I can't. I can't, my
fingers are too full of beer.

-Thanks, man.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.877

ISAAC: <i>May I speak with you</i>

01:39.140 --> 01:41.434
Sorry, busy having fun.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.522
Rough burn, man.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.108
ISAAC: <i>I have been attempting</i>

01:49.693 --> 01:53.071
<i>However, my overtures have been</i>

01:53.154 --> 01:54.823
Yeah, that's going to be
a tough one, Isaac,

01:54.906 --> 01:56.074
and I don't have
to tell you why.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.410
ISAAC: <i>My command of the nuances</i>
<i>of discourse</i>

01:58.493 --> 01:59.869

01:59.953 --> 02:01.413
Ah, don't beat yourself up.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.623
ISAAC:

ISAAC: <i>Yes.</i>

02:10.463 --> 02:12.215
Uh, there's no simple
answer to that,

02:12.298 --> 02:13.842
but I guess a good
place to start

02:13.925 --> 02:16.344
is to ask the other person
about themselves.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.596
People like it when you take
an interest in their lives.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.265
ISAAC:
<i>Please clarify.</i>

02:20.348 --> 02:21.891
Well, it could be anything.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.560
Ask them do they
play any sports,

02:23.643 --> 02:24.894
what kind of music do they like?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.104
What are some of their hobbies?

02:26.187 --> 02:27.689
Give them a compliment
on their haircut.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.149
Whatever you could think of.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.776

Hey, Gordon, what's this?

02:57.635 --> 02:58.970
Oh.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.598
It's a... it's a cellphone.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.849
A what?

03:03.475 --> 03:06.770
It's a communication device
from the early 21st century.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.855
Wow. Is it real?

03:08.938 --> 03:11.024
Nah. It's a replicated version

03:11.107 --> 03:15.153
of a real one they found
in a time capsule on Earth.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.906
Belonged to a woman named
Laura Huggins.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.657
Here, I'll show you.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.079
-Is that her?
-Yeah.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.416
She was really pretty.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.044
She was, yeah.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.212
You know, you can learn a lot

03:32.295 --> 03:33.672
about the people of
that time period

03:33.755 --> 03:34.964
from one of these things.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.925
I learned a lot about her.

03:37.008 --> 03:41.971
Had the computer replicate this
as a... sort of memento.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.431
To keep her in my thoughts.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.433
You talk like you
knew this girl.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.645
Kind of feel like I did.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.648
Want to take a selfie?

03:51.731 --> 03:52.816
A what?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.401
Something I learned
from Laura.

03:54.484 --> 03:58.530
Thank you for the invitation
to your party, Lieutenant.

03:58.613 --> 03:59.781
I must be going.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.409
Oh, here, wait, before you go.
Get in this.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.621
Okay, everybody, big
smiles, okay? Big smiles.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.249
Here we go.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.128
(shutter clicks)

04:14.963 --> 04:16.965
(tranquil music playing)

04:23.972 --> 04:25.849
Essentially, it's two major
breakthroughs

04:25.932 --> 04:27.100
for the price of one.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.309
And I mean major.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.437
First off, the projection radius
of the field

04:30.520 --> 04:32.105
is about three orders
of magnitude

04:32.188 --> 04:34.190
greater than Dr. Aronov's
original device.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.400
Which means what?

04:35.483 --> 04:37.277
Which means
the temporal field expansion

04:37.360 --> 04:40.447
could theoretically
encompass an entire ship.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.907
That's... a significant
upgrade.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.785
Hey, man, what's goin' on?
We were supposed to have lunch.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.495
Ah, sorry, man, I
got sidetracked.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.747
Well, we doin' it?

04:48.830 --> 04:50.331
I can't. I'll owe you one?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.375
All right, well, I'm starving.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.587
KELLY GRAYSON: You said there
were two breakthroughs.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.713
Egg salad sandwich.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.131
ISAAC: <i>We have managed</i>
<i>to increase</i>

04:58.214 --> 05:00.133
<i>the temporal resolution</i>
<i>of the field.</i>

05:00.216 --> 05:02.010
In other words, we can tune
the field down

05:02.093 --> 05:03.553
to the exact millisecond.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.513
Oh, Gordon, uh, can I borrow
your sandwich?

05:05.597 --> 05:06.723
Sure.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.684
Now, in ten seconds,
I'm going to send this sandwich

05:09.768 --> 05:11.811
exactly ten seconds
into the past.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.147
(energy pulsing)

05:15.273 --> 05:17.275
-Where'd that come from?
-JOHN LAMARR: The future.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.027
Now watch.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.373
You just sent that sandwich
into the past,

05:31.456 --> 05:33.500
and that's why it appeared
ten seconds ago.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.459
Boom.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.960
Well, why wouldn't
you just keep it?

05:36.044 --> 05:38.088
Then you could have
two sandwiches instead of one.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.298
ISAAC: <i>If Commander Lamarr</i>
<i>had not followed through</i>

05:40.382 --> 05:42.759
<i>with his intent to send the</i>
<i>sandwich into the past,</i>

05:42.842 --> 05:45.220
<i>it would have caused</i>
<i>a temporal paradox.</i>

05:45.303 --> 05:47.222
In which case
an entirely new universe

05:47.305 --> 05:48.556
would've branched off
from this one,

05:48.640 --> 05:49.808
all because of a sandwich.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.226
Makes your head hurt.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.520
Hey, wait! (snaps fingers)
I got an idea!

05:54.270 --> 05:56.856
Can you send that
three months into the future?

05:56.940 --> 05:58.316
Yeah, why?

05:58.400 --> 06:01.027
Because three months from now,
it'll appear,

06:01.111 --> 06:02.821
and that'll be a nice surprise.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.489
Okay.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.494
(energy pulsing)

06:09.577 --> 06:12.539
Aw, I'm excited. I can't wait
to eat that sandwich.

06:12.622 --> 06:16.042
Well, as novel as this is,
it also means the Aronov device

06:16.126 --> 06:17.752
just became a lot more potent.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.379
The Admirals should
be notified.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.924
<i>It's undeniable they've</i>
<i>achieved</i>

06:23.008 --> 06:24.718

<i>I wish they hadn't.</i>

06:27.262 --> 06:29.472
March of progress.
Can't stop it.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.349
<i>The weaponization</i>
<i>of time travel</i>

06:31.433 --> 06:33.685

06:33.768 --> 06:35.979
<i>If the Krill or the Kaylon</i>
<i>ever achieved it,</i>

06:36.062 --> 06:38.606
<i>they could skip the galactic</i>
<i>brinksmanship</i>

06:38.690 --> 06:41.568
<i>and simply destroy the Union</i>
<i>at its inception.</i>

06:41.651 --> 06:43.069
How do you want
us to handle it?

06:43.153 --> 06:45.071
<i>I'm going to recommend</i>

<i>all data over to their care.</i>

06:53.997 --> 06:56.583

He's losing his favorite toy.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.918

14:16.690 --> 14:18.108
And it's not possible he
was injured

14:18.191 --> 14:19.359
during one of the blasts?

14:19.442 --> 14:20.819
On his way back to the bridge?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.070
I've done a full scan.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.613
If he hit his head
and took a fall somewhere,

14:23.697 --> 14:24.614
I'd know about it.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.574
Captain, these magnetic
impedance readings,

14:26.658 --> 14:27.617
they don't add up.

14:27.742 --> 14:28.785
What do you mean?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.370
Well, the residual
energy signature

14:30.453 --> 14:32.038
makes it look like
the Aronov device

14:32.122 --> 14:33.498
has been running at full power,

14:33.581 --> 14:35.291
but it hasn't been
activated in days.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.752
Could there have been
some sort of overload?

14:37.836 --> 14:40.588
You mean could he have been
vaporized by a power surge?

14:40.672 --> 14:41.881
No. No way.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.009
The scans would pick up
any organic residue.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.135
There's nothing.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.720
Well then where
the hell is he?

14:46.803 --> 14:49.014
-(comms beeps)
-BORTUS: <i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

14:49.097 --> 14:50.181
Go ahead.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.976
BORTUS:
<i>We are... being hailed.</i>

14:53.059 --> 14:54.060

15:00.275 --> 15:02.277
(monitor beeping)

15:03.528 --> 15:05.196
Where is it coming from?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.907
ISAAC: <i>The message appears</i>
<i>to have originated from Earth.</i>

15:07.991 --> 15:11.369
<i>However, it is encoded</i>
<i>on a sub-quantum carrier wave,</i>

15:11.453 --> 15:14.789
<i>calibrated to 3.7 times</i>
<i>the speed of light.</i>

15:14.873 --> 15:16.207
<i>At such a velocity,</i>

15:16.291 --> 15:18.126
<i>its time of transmission</i>
<i>would be...</i>

15:18.835 --> 15:21.087
<i>approximately 400 years ago.</i>

15:23.298 --> 15:25.800
So it was calculated to reach
the Veil nebula from Earth

15:25.884 --> 15:27.469
at exactly this point in time.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.595
ISAAC:
<i>Affirmative.</i>

15:28.678 --> 15:30.305
<i>There is some degradation,</i>

15:30.388 --> 15:33.391

Gordon Malloy.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.696
Pilot and flight engineer
for a private charter airline.

16:27.779 --> 16:32.325
Died in Pasadena, California,
July 12th, 2068.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.785
How did this happen?

16:33.868 --> 16:35.662
Well, we think we know,
because in fact,

16:35.745 --> 16:37.372
we've seen it before.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.082
ISAAC:
<i>As you will recall,</i>

16:39.165 --> 16:40.709
<i>when Commander Grayson's</i>
<i>younger self</i>

16:40.792 --> 16:42.377
<i>was transported to our time,</i>

16:42.460 --> 16:44.754
<i>we were able to confirm</i>
<i>that human cognition</i>

16:44.838 --> 16:47.007
<i>played a role</i>
<i>in the temporal displacement.</i>

16:47.090 --> 16:49.676
LAMARR: We think we're looking
at a similar explanation here.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.803
The other night at the party,
Charly was asking Gordon

16:51.886 --> 16:53.805
about the cellular phone
in his quarters.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.265
Got him talking about Laura.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.350
Now, we're still
just beginning to understand

16:57.434 --> 16:59.019
the relationship between
temporal theory

16:59.102 --> 17:00.311
and observer perception,

17:00.395 --> 17:01.438
but the short of it is,

17:01.521 --> 17:03.398
Gordon was close to
the Aronov device

17:03.481 --> 17:05.025
when we overloaded
the deflectors.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.068
The burst of energy
from the quantum drive

17:07.152 --> 17:09.154
amplified the temporal field
before it collapsed,

17:09.237 --> 17:11.698
and he got caught
in the displacement wave.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.742
I might be off base, but my bet

17:13.825 --> 17:17.704
is that his subconscious
picked that destination point:

17:17.787 --> 17:19.205
the early 21st century.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.042
So he's... trapped
in the past?

17:22.125 --> 17:23.752
He was.

17:23.835 --> 17:27.255
According to these records,
he lived and died back there.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.424
So... if that's the case,

17:29.507 --> 17:31.468
it must mean we weren't
able to save him.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.679
She is correct.
We have already failed.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.847
Not necessarily.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.266
See, that's where
temporal mechanics gets muddy.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.601
It's all in flux.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.270
ISAAC: <i>Our behavior is,</i>
<i>as yet, a variable.</i>

17:42.354 --> 17:45.899
<i>Until and if we make the</i>
<i>attempt to rescue Lt. Malloy,</i>

17:45.982 --> 17:48.026
<i>we are existing in</i>
<i>a superposition</i>

17:48.109 --> 17:49.903
<i>of several possible timelines.</i>

17:49.986 --> 17:51.488
Then he can be rescued.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.491
But... why is there any record
of him at all?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.742
He knows the law.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.327
If you find yourself
displaced in time,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.371
you make yourself as invisible
as you can.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.414
You do everything
in your power not to interfere.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.541
Now that, I can't answer.

18:03.625 --> 18:07.379
Is it possible for us to
go back and get him?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.423
With the upgrades to
the Aronov device,

18:10.507 --> 18:12.801
and the temporal coordinates
Gordon sent us in the message,

18:12.884 --> 18:13.968
we got a shot.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.804
But, it's gonna put
a hell of a strain

18:15.887 --> 18:17.138
on the quantum drive.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.851
He's calling out to
us from the past,

18:21.935 --> 18:23.478
asking for our help.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.731
And temporal law
compels us to try.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.317

18:30.777 --> 18:32.779
(contemplative music playing)

19:14.946 --> 19:16.197
Isaac, what's your status?

19:16.281 --> 19:18.116
ISAAC: <i>I will require</i>
<i>additional power</i>

19:18.199 --> 19:20.076
<i>to increase chronon</i>
<i>energy levels.</i>

19:20.160 --> 19:22.120
Lamarr, give Isaac

<i>successfully made</i>
<i>the transition.</i>

Let's find out.

Ensign Burke, set
course for Earth.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.598
Aye, sir.

old-style communication signals

20:49.374 --> 20:51.292
on multiple radio frequencies.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.253
Looks like we've arrived
in the right century.

20:53.336 --> 20:54.879
Electromagnetic screens?

20:54.963 --> 20:55.880
Functioning.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.132
We are undetectable

20:57.215 --> 20:58.675

technology.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.093
Let's play it safe.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.053

side of the moon.

<i>I got some bad news.</i>

21:08.476 --> 21:11.021
The time jump ate up the last
of our dysonium reserves

21:11.104 --> 21:13.773
before we reached the temporal
coordinates Gordon sent us.

21:13.857 --> 21:16.317
-We didn't quite make it.
-What do you mean?

21:16.401 --> 21:18.528
Talla confirmed this
is the 21st century.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.239
It is, but our target
date was 2015.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.782
We came up a little short.

21:22.866 --> 21:26.369
According to our astrometric
scans... we're in 2025.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.580
2025?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.624
-So, Gordon...
-From Gordon's perspective,

21:31.708 --> 21:33.460
he's been here for ten years.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.588
Jesus.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.134
I don't suppose we
can try again.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.427
Sir, without dysonium,

21:42.510 --> 21:44.387
we can't get back
to our own time from here.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.389
Then we'll just have to
go down there and get him,

21:46.473 --> 21:47.724
worry about how to
get back later.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.685
ISAAC: <i>Captain, in the early</i>

21:50.769 --> 21:52.062
<i>deposits of dysonium</i>

21:52.145 --> 21:53.980

<i>Earth's mantle.</i>

<i>However, at this current</i>

22:03.615 --> 22:07.202
All right. Kelly and I will
go after Gordon, bring him home.

22:07.285 --> 22:10.121
John, you'll get the dysonium.
Make every effort to avoid--

22:10.205 --> 22:11.998
Captain, I'm not trying
to shirk duty here,

22:12.082 --> 22:14.000
but we just put this
ship through hell.

22:14.084 --> 22:16.127
Alright, there are about
a thousand systems on board

22:16.211 --> 22:18.380
that need to be inspected and
repaired just to stay afloat,

22:18.463 --> 22:19.756
including life support.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.341
Well, is there anyone
on your engineering team

22:21.424 --> 22:22.384
who's up to it?

22:22.467 --> 22:23.760
There's one guy
who could do it

22:23.843 --> 22:26.179
a hell of a lot faster
and more efficiently than I can.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.263
Who?

22:27.347 --> 22:28.807
You're lookin' at him.

22:29.599 --> 22:30.850
Isaac?

22:30.934 --> 22:32.811
ISAAC: <i>Commander Lamarr</i>
<i>is correct.</i>

22:32.894 --> 22:34.896
<i>I am able to direct</i>
<i>a geodetic probe</i>

22:34.979 --> 22:37.315
<i>with greater precision</i>
<i>than a biological.</i>

22:37.399 --> 22:40.485
<i>However, its course will need</i>
<i>to be plotted in real time,</i>

22:40.568 --> 22:41.861
<i>with the proper adjustments,</i>

<i>to ensure minimal geological</i>

22:43.947 --> 22:45.615
<i>now and in the future.</i>

22:45.699 --> 22:47.909
You make a wrong turn,
you could displace a fault line

22:47.992 --> 22:50.078
that causes an earthquake
20 years in the future.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.329
You basically gotta drill

22:51.413 --> 22:53.289
while you're calculating
trajectories

22:53.373 --> 22:54.708
in multiple dimensions.

ISAAC: <i>I will require the</i>

23:00.797 --> 23:04.217
(sighs) I'm gonna ask
a pretty basic question here.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.302
How the hell is Isaac
supposed to walk around

23:06.386 --> 23:07.846
21st-century Earth?

24:32.138 --> 24:34.265
within a 1,000-kilometer radius.

24:34.349 --> 24:36.726
Great. At least we
won't hit a plane.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.197
Do you play any sports?

24:59.708 --> 25:01.710
♪♪

25:29.070 --> 25:30.530
(hydraulics whirring)

25:42.208 --> 25:45.545
Okay. We all know
we're threading a needle here.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.006
Avoid any unnecessary
temporal footprints,

25:48.089 --> 25:49.632
but complete the mission
at all costs.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.343
Simple as that.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.011
All right, let's go.

25:57.974 --> 25:59.976
(contemplative music playing)

26:09.027 --> 26:10.779
(jet engine idling)

26:30.715 --> 26:32.509
(engines powering down)

26:40.975 --> 26:43.269
You want those TKS panels
installed in the Hawker?

26:43.353 --> 26:44.771
Yeah. If it's good
to go by tomorrow,

26:44.854 --> 26:46.481
we can put it back in service
by the fifth.

26:46.564 --> 26:47.816
Got it.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.526
(exhales)

26:50.652 --> 26:53.530
Hey, Gordo, you expecting
clients?

26:54.322 --> 26:55.532
No, why?

27:20.056 --> 27:21.141
Gordon.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.018
My god.

27:23.852 --> 27:24.936
How are you?

27:25.770 --> 27:26.980
I'm...

27:30.066 --> 27:32.152
I can't believe this
is happening.

27:34.529 --> 27:35.530
You're here.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.199
You're actually...

27:39.617 --> 27:40.910
You're actually here.

27:41.578 --> 27:44.247
Yeah. About ten
years too late.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.002
Are you okay?

27:50.628 --> 27:51.963
I'm...

27:52.047 --> 27:54.257
I'm fine, yeah.

27:55.133 --> 27:57.052
I just... I can't
believe it's you.

27:57.135 --> 27:59.179
I'm so sorry it
took us so long.

27:59.262 --> 28:01.890
I just never expected
to see you guys again.

28:01.973 --> 28:04.142
Well, we're here now.

28:04.225 --> 28:06.269
And we're gonna try
and make it home.

28:07.270 --> 28:08.229
Home?

28:08.313 --> 28:09.481
Yes.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.319
Can we take a ride?

28:18.782 --> 28:21.451
Somebody already
had "Orville" with an R.

28:21.534 --> 28:22.827
I was so pissed.

28:22.911 --> 28:25.038
"O-ville" was the best
that I could do.

28:25.121 --> 28:26.289
Sounds like a shitty band.

28:26.373 --> 28:28.208
(sniffs) What's that smell?

28:28.291 --> 28:31.127
Oh sorry, Right Guard.

28:31.211 --> 28:32.379
(laughs) I was late
for work today,

28:32.462 --> 28:33.546
I had to get ready in the car.

28:33.630 --> 28:35.465
Accidentally popped the
top off the can.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.217
It sprayed everywhere.

28:37.425 --> 28:40.345
Seems like you've...
acclimated to this century.

28:40.428 --> 28:43.181
Yeah. Y'know, this time period
gets a bad rap,

28:43.264 --> 28:44.557
but there's a lot
to like about it

28:44.641 --> 28:45.684
if you look hard enough.

28:45.767 --> 28:46.851
Like what?

28:47.227 --> 28:50.814
Well, you know, it's like
watching your little brother

28:50.897 --> 28:52.399
make a bunch
of stupid mistakes.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.192
Yeah, he's an idiot now,

28:54.275 --> 28:57.278
but you can see him learning,
and growing,

28:57.362 --> 28:59.531
and you know that someday
all those mistakes

28:59.614 --> 29:01.700
are gonna turn him
into a smart guy.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.159
That's pretty forgiving,

29:03.284 --> 29:05.412
when you think about what these
people left us to clean up.

29:05.495 --> 29:07.872
I guess I've always had
an attraction to this era.

29:07.956 --> 29:11.710
And over the years,
I've gotten comfortable here.

29:12.669 --> 29:16.047
You know, when no one
came for me, I...

29:16.131 --> 29:19.300
had to make peace with the fact
that this was home now.

29:19.384 --> 29:21.428
Hell, I didn't even
know if the Orville

29:21.511 --> 29:23.388
survived the battle
with the Kaylon.

29:24.431 --> 29:28.560
Look, Gordon, I can't imagine
how hard this has been for you.

29:28.643 --> 29:31.646
But, Jesus Christ, you're
a Union officer.

29:31.730 --> 29:33.606
And I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't point out--

29:33.690 --> 29:35.817
Please, please, don't
say it, please.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.571
Temporal law. Stay invisible.
Don't interact with anyone.

29:39.654 --> 29:41.614
If we make it back,

29:41.698 --> 29:43.825
you're gonna have to
answer for this.

29:43.908 --> 29:45.493
You know that.

29:51.708 --> 29:52.584
(sighs)

30:09.517 --> 30:11.144
(turns off engine)

30:12.896 --> 30:14.272
I'm not going back with you.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.901
-What?
-What do you mean?

30:20.236 --> 30:21.446
Come inside.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.626
-Sweetie?
-(keys jingle)

30:38.171 --> 30:40.590
-WOMAN: Hi, baby. Hi.
-GORDON: Hi.

30:40.674 --> 30:43.593
Oh. Who are your friends?

30:44.094 --> 30:47.389
-This is Ed and Kelly.
-Hi.

30:50.684 --> 30:54.604
This is my son Edward,
and my wife Laura.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.272
(Laura giggles)

30:57.732 --> 30:58.608
(sighs)

31:14.040 --> 31:15.458
(monitor beeping)

31:15.542 --> 31:18.378
I believe I have located
the nearest dysonium deposit.

31:18.461 --> 31:21.256
It appears to be six kilometers
below the crust.

31:21.339 --> 31:23.425
Can you get a lock
on the optimal drilling site?

31:23.508 --> 31:24.676
I believe so.

31:24.801 --> 31:27.220
Increasing scan resolution
will take a moment.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.852
What kind of music do you like?

31:34.894 --> 31:36.938
-What?
-(scanner beeping)

31:37.897 --> 31:39.482
There is a suitable bore site

31:39.566 --> 31:42.152
23.7 kilometers from our
present position.

31:42.235 --> 31:43.611
That's a good hike.

31:43.695 --> 31:45.321
We could use some
transportation.

31:47.282 --> 31:48.324
Look.

31:49.034 --> 31:52.120
(rock guitar playing)

31:52.203 --> 31:53.163
I have an idea.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.558
So listen, you, uh...

32:55.809 --> 32:57.352
you got a couple
bikes out there?

32:57.435 --> 32:59.145
Two Screamin' Eagle V-Rods.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.147
Ooh, yeah, those are beauties.

33:02.065 --> 33:05.360
I, um, don't suppose
you'd let us

33:05.443 --> 33:07.237
borrow them for a few hours?

33:08.238 --> 33:10.115
(laughing)

33:10.198 --> 33:12.450
Your sister's got some big ol'
balls on her, doesn't she?

33:12.534 --> 33:15.870
Negative. Her anatomical
construct is comprised of--

33:15.954 --> 33:21.626
So, tell me...
who's the strongest guy in here?

33:22.252 --> 33:23.211
(spluttering)

33:23.294 --> 33:26.548
That would probably
be, uh... me.

33:26.631 --> 33:29.968
He's fulla shit. It's
Richie over there.

33:32.345 --> 33:33.930
Okay. How about this:

33:34.014 --> 33:35.390
If my brother here

33:35.473 --> 33:38.476
can beat Richie
in an arm-wrestling match,

33:39.269 --> 33:40.770
you give us your bikes.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.147
(laughing)

33:44.024 --> 33:46.109
-Are you kiddin' me?
-Is it a bet?

33:46.192 --> 33:48.361
Well, what do we
get if you lose?

33:48.445 --> 33:50.155

Don't call me... never mind.

34:16.973 --> 34:18.099
Okay.

34:18.183 --> 34:19.684

Oh, no, I am losing.

35:05.689 --> 35:08.441

♪♪

35:36.886 --> 35:40.724
So, I was singing at this
little pub back in New York,

35:40.807 --> 35:45.395
and, uh, one night this awkward
kind of dorky guy walks in--

35:45.478 --> 35:47.355
-Oh, come on!
-And...

35:47.439 --> 35:48.565
And he's all alone,

35:48.648 --> 35:50.900
and he's clapping louder
than anyone,

35:50.984 --> 35:52.736
so obviously you know
what my first thought is,

35:52.819 --> 35:55.405
-weirdo loner, creepy guy...
-(Gordon laughs)

35:55.488 --> 35:57.949
...who's probably gonna ask
if he can buy me a drink.

35:58.033 --> 36:00.201
-Which of course I do.
-Which of course he does.

36:00.285 --> 36:01.411
And, so I'm like--

36:01.494 --> 36:03.663
Dad, can I have
some more juice?

36:03.747 --> 36:05.331
Of course you can, pal.
You want my help?

36:05.415 --> 36:06.499
No, I got it.

36:06.583 --> 36:07.917
Okay.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.337
LAURA: So, I'm like, you know,
ten seconds away

36:10.420 --> 36:12.797
from blowing him off
and walking to my car,

36:12.881 --> 36:16.468
and then he starts talking
to me about my music.

36:16.551 --> 36:18.636
And... (sighs)

36:18.720 --> 36:21.639
it was so immediately
clear that he...

36:22.015 --> 36:23.516
got it.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.728
You know, he was really hearing
what I was trying to do up there

36:26.811 --> 36:28.688
and-and-and understood

36:28.897 --> 36:31.149
why it was the most important
thing in my life.

36:32.525 --> 36:34.486
You know, a lot of guys
had come to my shows,

36:34.569 --> 36:37.906
and-and thrown out compliments
trying to score, but with him...

36:37.989 --> 36:39.657
I-I had no intention
of having sex with her.

36:39.741 --> 36:41.242
I thought she was ugly, really.

36:41.326 --> 36:43.787
-(laughing) Stop. Let me finish.
-GORDON: Okay.

36:43.870 --> 36:46.873
He, he just really cared
about getting to know <i>me.</i>

36:46.956 --> 36:49.125
You know, and so I thought,

36:49.209 --> 36:53.088
hey, not my usual type,
but... (laughs)

36:53.171 --> 36:56.091
what the hell, give it a shot.

36:56.841 --> 36:59.302
I-- I had just broken up
with this guy Greg,

36:59.386 --> 37:02.430
and the last thing that I wanted
was another douchebag--

37:02.514 --> 37:03.932
But she went out
with me anyway.

37:04.015 --> 37:06.267
That's right, yeah.
Look at us.

37:06.351 --> 37:08.019
Seven years later,
that douchebag's my husband.

37:08.103 --> 37:09.771
-I'm her douchebag.
-(laughs)

37:11.064 --> 37:15.026
Well, this is a very
delicious lunch. Thank you.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.194
Sure.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.571
So, uh, how long have you
been in aviation?

37:18.655 --> 37:20.281
-Five years.
-Ten years.

37:20.365 --> 37:22.325
-Seems like five, doesn't it?
-It does.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.202
That's why I said five
'cause it seems like it.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.245
But yeah, ten years.

37:26.204 --> 37:29.791
And Gordon tells me that you,
uh, work out of the Boston area.

37:29.874 --> 37:31.334
You must be Sox fans.

37:35.213 --> 37:39.050
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
it gets cold out there,

37:39.134 --> 37:41.052
so, socks are, um...

37:43.972 --> 37:45.640
-Socks are important.
-Mm.

(electronic humming)

38:04.868 --> 38:07.454
Hey. Bortus is asking
for a shipwide status report.

38:07.537 --> 38:09.956
-How we doing down here?
-Uh, slow but steady.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.833
Would you hand me
that phase modulator?

38:14.586 --> 38:16.254
You think we're gonna be able
to make it home?

38:16.796 --> 38:19.132
Well, Orville's a tough ship.

38:19.215 --> 38:21.092
If Isaac and Charly
get the dysonium,

38:21.176 --> 38:22.260
she'll make it.

38:24.554 --> 38:26.389
-(groans)
-What's wrong?

38:26.473 --> 38:28.016
I tweaked a muscle
in my upper back.

38:28.099 --> 38:29.184
Acts up sometimes.

38:29.267 --> 38:30.435
I've been meaning
to see Dr. Finn,

38:30.518 --> 38:31.603
I've just been so busy.

38:31.686 --> 38:33.438
-Where?
-Right shoulder?

38:33.521 --> 38:35.065
Want me to see if
I can get at it?

38:35.148 --> 38:36.941
That's very nice,
but I've tried.

38:37.025 --> 38:38.777
With a Xelayan?

38:39.444 --> 38:40.528
Well, no.

38:42.572 --> 38:44.657
Okay, take a stab at it.

38:47.535 --> 38:48.745
Holy shit.

38:48.828 --> 38:50.413
Hang on, I feel it.

38:50.497 --> 38:51.790
Oh, my god...

38:51.873 --> 38:53.917
Oh, my god.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.377
Ahh!

38:55.460 --> 38:56.670
-Yep.
-Ahh!

38:56.836 --> 38:58.380
-Sorry, did that hurt?
-No. No, no.

38:58.463 --> 39:00.674
Keep going, keep going.

39:01.591 --> 39:03.301
Wow, how long you known
how to do this?

39:03.385 --> 39:05.011
I don't know how to do this.

39:05.095 --> 39:06.638
Ahh! Whoo!

39:06.721 --> 39:08.431
-TALLA KEYALI: Yep.
-(John oohing and ahhing)

39:08.515 --> 39:09.849
(John laughs)

39:09.933 --> 39:12.102
Ahh! It's like a 50 G-force,

39:12.185 --> 39:13.978
completely focused
and controlled.

39:14.062 --> 39:15.897
Oh, my god!

39:15.980 --> 39:17.649
Ah, you gotta be kidding me
with this shit.

39:17.732 --> 39:19.150
Yep, there it is.

39:19.776 --> 39:21.069
Got it.

39:23.363 --> 39:24.698
Better?

39:32.455 --> 39:34.416
(dogs barking in distance)

39:51.516 --> 39:53.143
Can we talk now?

39:53.935 --> 39:55.979
Yeah. We can talk.

39:56.062 --> 40:00.066
Look, I understand that you
got a raw deal, I really do.

40:00.483 --> 40:02.193
But I want to hear a goddamn
good explanation

40:02.277 --> 40:03.194
for what's happening,

40:03.278 --> 40:04.779
because the way I see it,

40:04.863 --> 40:06.823
we oughta haul your ass
back to the ship right now

40:06.906 --> 40:07.907
and throw you in the brig.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.243
-Shut up.
-Excuse me, Lieutenant?

40:10.326 --> 40:12.912
No. No, I-I'm not
your lieutenant.

40:12.996 --> 40:15.373
I'm not your helmsman,
I'm not your crew.

40:15.457 --> 40:17.751
I'm Gordon Malloy,
and this is <i>my </i>house.

40:17.834 --> 40:19.836
Gordon. You're guilty of
about 50 counts

40:19.919 --> 40:21.379
of temporal contamination.

40:21.463 --> 40:23.381
You broke the law, and god knows
what the consequences...

40:23.465 --> 40:25.175
Screw the law!

40:26.634 --> 40:29.512
I spent three years
obeying the law.

40:30.055 --> 40:33.350
I hid in an abandoned cabin
in the woods of Connecticut,

40:33.433 --> 40:35.060
and I did my goddamn duty.

40:35.602 --> 40:37.771
I stayed invisible. I didn't--
I didn't see anyone,

40:37.854 --> 40:39.397
I didn't go anywhere.

40:40.273 --> 40:41.900
You know what I ate?

40:41.983 --> 40:43.485
Animals. Yeah.

40:44.069 --> 40:46.196
I was holding my weapon
when I got sent back,

40:46.279 --> 40:48.448
and I used it to kill animals.

40:48.531 --> 40:50.784
You wanna talk
about breaking the law?

40:50.867 --> 40:53.453
Here it's no big deal,
but in our time?

40:53.536 --> 40:55.205
I'm a serial murderer, folks.

40:55.914 --> 40:58.041
You know what that
does to your head?

40:58.124 --> 41:00.877
So, after three years,
I said the hell with it.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.754
Temporal law can blow me.

41:02.837 --> 41:04.547
Yeah, it looks fine on paper,

41:04.631 --> 41:06.007
but the Union has no idea

41:06.091 --> 41:08.593
what it's like to be
trapped, no idea.

41:11.096 --> 41:14.140
So... so I went looking for her.

41:15.100 --> 41:18.019
And I found her.
And I made a life for myself.

41:18.770 --> 41:21.856
And I will not let you make me
feel like shit for doing it.

41:22.357 --> 41:24.567
I'm a human being.
We're social creatures.

41:24.651 --> 41:26.361
Without each other, we die.

41:27.737 --> 41:29.614
Was I supposed to die?

41:29.698 --> 41:32.409
To protect the timeline? Yes.

41:33.034 --> 41:35.995
Maybe this is how it's supposed
to be! Who's to say?

41:36.079 --> 41:38.623
Who's to say I shouldn't be able
to do whatever I want?

41:38.707 --> 41:41.876
Oh. It seems you really have
acclimated to this century.

41:42.752 --> 41:45.714
When you joined the fleet,
you took an oath to the Union.

41:45.797 --> 41:48.008
You're here. You're here!

41:48.091 --> 41:50.010
Which means the Union
still exists in the future.

41:50.093 --> 41:51.428
-If anything was gonna happen...
-No.

41:51.511 --> 41:52.512
it already happened.

41:52.595 --> 41:53.805
-That's how the physics works.
-No.

41:53.888 --> 41:55.223
No. The timeline is okay.

41:55.348 --> 41:56.683
You're deluding yourself.

41:56.766 --> 41:58.852
Nobody really understands
time travel.

41:58.935 --> 42:01.271
According to Isaac,
it's all still in flux.

42:01.354 --> 42:03.565
He says observer interaction
is still a variable,

42:03.648 --> 42:06.359
and until we act one
way or the other,

42:06.484 --> 42:07.944
all timelines are possible.

42:08.069 --> 42:10.447
How do you know that your son
won't grow up to start a war

42:10.530 --> 42:12.991
that could delay
or even prevent Union emergence?

42:13.074 --> 42:14.284
Or maybe,

42:14.367 --> 42:16.870
maybe one of his descendants
helps create it.

42:16.953 --> 42:19.164
Or, or maybe even gives
birth to you.

42:19.247 --> 42:20.540
Or to me.

42:20.623 --> 42:21.875
That's my point.

42:21.958 --> 42:24.085
Gordon, without knowing,
we can't interfere.

42:24.169 --> 42:26.379
We don't have the wisdom,
we don't have the foresight.

42:26.463 --> 42:29.090
You may have done irreparable
damage already, we don't know.

42:29.174 --> 42:31.217
But the longer you're here,
the greater the risk.

42:31.301 --> 42:32.635
According to Isaac,
we're existi--

42:32.844 --> 42:35.055
Oh, yeah, and-and Isaac's always
been trustworthy, hasn't he?

42:35.138 --> 42:37.349
-Oh, Jesus, Gordon, come on--
-What?

42:37.432 --> 42:39.976
What? H-he helped the Kaylon
kill thousands of people.

42:40.060 --> 42:41.644
That we know for sure.

42:41.728 --> 42:44.022
So, a verifiable crime is,
is less serious

42:44.105 --> 42:45.357
than a hypothetical one?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.858
Nice priorities.

42:52.072 --> 42:54.032
You have to come with us.

42:56.910 --> 42:57.952
Forget it.

42:58.453 --> 42:59.996
You sent that message.

43:00.538 --> 43:02.499
You wanted us to come
take you home.

43:02.582 --> 43:03.541
We're here.

43:03.667 --> 43:06.169
Ten years ago I wanted it!

43:08.254 --> 43:10.465
More than anything
in the galaxy.

43:11.758 --> 43:12.926
But, not now.

43:15.095 --> 43:16.638
You took too long.

43:18.306 --> 43:19.724
And, I'm happy here.

Somehow I think I-I've
always known.

44:37.844 --> 44:40.805
There's just something
about you that's...

44:42.515 --> 44:43.808
different.

44:46.144 --> 44:49.230
It's this energy that
surrounds you.

44:56.946 --> 44:58.865
Even when the pandemic came...

45:01.159 --> 45:02.494
you knew.

45:03.119 --> 45:06.498
When everything around us seemed
like it was falling apart...

45:07.791 --> 45:10.377
you told me it was
gonna be okay.

45:13.463 --> 45:15.006
And, you know what?

45:15.090 --> 45:16.841
I believed you.

45:16.925 --> 45:18.301
Because...

45:21.513 --> 45:22.806
you know.

45:23.390 --> 45:24.683
Don't you?

45:26.184 --> 45:27.227
And it...

45:28.728 --> 45:31.022
it doesn't change
the way you feel?

45:31.106 --> 45:32.607
About us?

45:33.274 --> 45:36.778
You mean because you've been
lying to me our entire life?

45:36.861 --> 45:38.905
Laura, if I had told you...

45:38.988 --> 45:40.407
It would've been useless.

45:40.490 --> 45:42.701
Well, would it?

45:43.785 --> 45:46.037
I honestly don't know.

45:49.624 --> 45:52.127
I suppose that's why
it was meant to happen now.

45:53.795 --> 45:55.463
When I was ready to hear it.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.969
And I know it's the truth.

46:02.512 --> 46:04.222

you were gone.

Oh... few years.

51:16.493 --> 51:19.204
Do you not wish to avail
yourself of my thanks?

51:19.287 --> 51:20.997
Isaac, I was doing my duty.

51:21.081 --> 51:23.291
And I can promise you,
I didn't like it one bit.

51:23.375 --> 51:26.544
I was separating my job
from my personal feelings,

51:26.628 --> 51:27.587
that's all.

51:27.671 --> 51:29.005
I see.

51:29.089 --> 51:31.925
You still harbor negative
sentiments toward me.

51:32.008 --> 51:35.220
We have to work together.
Every day.

51:35.845 --> 51:37.806
But that doesn't change
what you did,

51:37.931 --> 51:40.016
and who I lost because of it.

51:46.439 --> 51:49.484
Does your machine brain have
any concept of what love is?

51:50.026 --> 51:51.695
I do not understand.

51:52.445 --> 51:54.280
Well, I'll help you.

51:54.364 --> 51:57.075
Amanda wasn't just
my best friend.

51:57.158 --> 51:58.576
I loved her.

52:00.578 --> 52:02.831
And I never got to
say it to her.

52:04.916 --> 52:06.501
She was someone I could've seen

52:06.584 --> 52:08.795
spending the rest
of my life with.

52:11.297 --> 52:13.883
And I have no idea if she felt
the same way.

52:14.759 --> 52:16.177
I waited too long to ask.

52:16.344 --> 52:17.512
And then she was gone.

52:17.721 --> 52:19.014
You took her life,

52:19.097 --> 52:21.516
and by doing that,
you took mine.

52:23.184 --> 52:24.936
Or what mine could've been.

52:26.938 --> 52:31.484
So yeah. I still harbor
"negative sentiments."

52:32.944 --> 52:35.739

No. Just a heavy stun.

54:49.706 --> 54:52.459

we'll be gone.

We need the Aronov device
to travel to the past, yeah?

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:23.660
But, if we wanna travel
to the future,

01:02:23.743 --> 01:02:25.412
we got a built-in method
right here.

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:27.706

01:02:27.914 --> 01:02:29.457
Whenever we're using
the quantum drive,

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:30.834
we're moving faster than light.

01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:33.420
But the quantum field creates
a bubble around the ship,

01:02:33.503 --> 01:02:36.006
isolating us from the normal
spacetime continuum.

01:02:36.089 --> 01:02:38.591
Otherwise, we'd be subject
to Einsteinian relativity:

01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:39.592
time dilation.

01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.219
The closer we get to
the speed of light,

01:02:41.302 --> 01:02:43.179
the faster time passes
outside the ship.

01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:45.932
Well, don't you see?

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.643

to prevent,

01:02:50.437 --> 01:02:51.604
we just allow to happen.

01:02:51.688 --> 01:02:52.981
We push the ship as
close as we can

01:02:53.064 --> 01:02:54.107
to the speed of light,

01:02:54.232 --> 01:02:55.900

01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:37.025
So, what do you think?

01:03:39.569 --> 01:03:40.653
Do it.

01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:42.655
(monitor beeping)

01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:44.741
(dramatic music playing)

01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:49.829
Status, Ensign?

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.539
Course laid in, sir.

01:03:51.623 --> 01:03:54.751
Helm has been re-calibrated
for relativistic velocity.

01:03:56.127 --> 01:03:57.337
Everyone buckle up.

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.298
Bridge to Lamarr.
On your mark.

01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:01.508
Acknowledged, Captain.

01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:04.052
Gordon. Engage quantum drive.

01:04:11.976 --> 01:04:13.978
(epic music playing)

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:31.621
Hard to believe we're watching
decades pass out there.

01:04:31.705 --> 01:04:33.665
♪♪

01:04:43.883 --> 01:04:45.510
Approaching Alpha Tucanae.

01:04:45.593 --> 01:04:47.762
-John?
-All clear.

01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:49.431
Decelerating.

01:05:02.068 --> 01:05:05.363
Two hundred years
down, 200 to go.

01:05:05.447 --> 01:05:08.158
-Course set for Earth.
-Bring us about.

01:05:08.241 --> 01:05:09.951
Aye, sir.

01:05:13.204 --> 01:05:14.748
Lamarr. On your mark.

01:05:14.831 --> 01:05:16.708
Engage main drive.

01:05:21.546 --> 01:05:23.006
(thrusters humming)

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.601
Lamarr to bridge.

01:05:34.684 --> 01:05:36.895
Gordon, switch to
computer control.

01:05:36.978 --> 01:05:38.772
Implement Isaac's presets.

01:05:41.941 --> 01:05:43.068
Done.

01:05:44.277 --> 01:05:45.695
Take us home, baby.

01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:47.614
(epic music playing)

01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:00.460
Approaching Earth.

01:06:00.543 --> 01:06:01.836
Magnify.

01:06:08.009 --> 01:06:09.219
That's more like it.

01:06:09.302 --> 01:06:10.512
Talla?

01:06:10.595 --> 01:06:12.806
Union Central is
responding, sir.

01:06:12.889 --> 01:06:14.307
We have permission to dock.

01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:16.393
(tranquil music playing)

01:06:25.568 --> 01:06:26.444
(sighs)

01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:48.633
I don't even know what to say.

01:06:48.717 --> 01:06:49.843
It must have been
the hardest thing

01:06:49.926 --> 01:06:51.219
you've ever had to
do in your life.

01:06:51.302 --> 01:06:54.097
Yeah, that's an
understatement.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.223
(scoffs)

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.142
I just...

01:06:57.308 --> 01:07:00.061
I can't believe I would
be that selfish.

01:07:00.145 --> 01:07:03.189
I mean, to-to risk the timeline,
to threaten you...

01:07:03.273 --> 01:07:07.193
You were tested to a degree
that none of us have ever been.

01:07:07.277 --> 01:07:09.154
Who's to say that we
wouldn't have done the same?

01:07:10.739 --> 01:07:13.324
A family does powerful
things to a person.

01:07:14.784 --> 01:07:15.785
Look...

01:07:16.828 --> 01:07:18.204
I know that...

01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:20.707
there's nothing that's gonna
make you feel better.

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.709
But, for what it's worth...

01:07:22.792 --> 01:07:24.294
you did the right thing.

01:07:24.836 --> 01:07:27.797
As hard as it was,
you put your duty first.

01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:30.216
Yeah, you're right.
I don't feel better.

01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:37.640
There are two children
who will never be born.

01:07:38.558 --> 01:07:40.268
And a future that will.

01:07:46.733 --> 01:07:51.321
Hey. How long has it been
since the three of us did this?

01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:53.698
Long time.

01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:55.408
Just like the old days.

01:07:55.492 --> 01:07:57.744
Well, in the old days, we would
have finished off that bottle

01:07:57.827 --> 01:07:58.870
and drained two more.

01:07:58.953 --> 01:08:00.955
Yeah, well, we were younger.

01:08:01.664 --> 01:08:04.000
You're right. Let's
try for three.

01:08:09.297 --> 01:08:11.091
(tranquil music playing)

01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:02.600
