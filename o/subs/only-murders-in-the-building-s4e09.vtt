Glen was brought in

The guy fucked up so bad,
Sazz had to blackball him.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.697
So, Sazz ended her protégé's career,

04:41.698 --> 04:43.616

04:43.617 --> 04:46.203
That's motive to kill both of 'em.

He was another victim.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.250
Who was this protégé?

are Sazz, Glen, and the director.
