WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.794
<i>So what's next, podcast-wise?</i>

00:04.504 --> 00:06.881
<i>What we need is a hot, fresh, dead body,</i>

00:06.881 --> 00:09.342
preferably right here
or very near to here.

00:09.342 --> 00:12.178
I got another email from that Bev Melon.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.389
They wanna make a movie of our podcast.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.891
- Paramount?
- They wanna fly us all out to LA

00:16.891 --> 00:19.144
for some meeting next week.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.645
Let's talk movies!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.814
<i>I invited Sazz to the party,</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:25.442
but she's back to not responding
and she usually gets right back to me.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.278
<i>She had something "sensitive"
to discuss with me.</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:31.114
She's had so many joints
replaced by metal.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.450
Apparently, the best ones
come from Bulgaria.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.826
What's all this?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.287
[on phone] <i>You need
your kitchen window replaced.</i>

00:37.287 --> 00:39.622
<i>Something left a little hole.</i>

00:39.622 --> 00:40.707
<i>Like a bullet hole?</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:54.888
<i>Okay, make-- Yeah. Mm-hmm.</i>

00:54.888 --> 00:56.347
<i>Well, hold on there.</i>

00:56.347 --> 00:59.142
<i>Stunt people are not actually daredevils.</i>

00:59.142 --> 01:01.227
Sure, we find danger sexy.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.480
You know, we like to flirt with it,

01:03.480 --> 01:04.773
buy it a drink,

01:04.773 --> 01:08.818
but we don't let it get into our pants.
You know?

01:08.818 --> 01:11.154
We do danger safely.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.781
So, if we do get hurt,

01:12.781 --> 01:15.033
we live to fall another day.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.495
You know who taught me that?

01:18.495 --> 01:21.456
The best stuntman in the world.

01:21.456 --> 01:25.126
My old man, Slim Pataki.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.422
<i>I come from a long line of stunt people.</i>
Are you ready?

01:29.422 --> 01:30.632
Yeah!
- Here we go!

01:30.632 --> 01:32.425
<i>You know,
while most parents are trying</i>

01:32.425 --> 01:33.968
<i>to keep their kids away from danger...</i>

01:33.968 --> 01:35.553
Oh!

01:35.553 --> 01:38.014
<i>...mine taught me how to play in it.
Honest to God.</i>

01:38.640 --> 01:40.391
Again, again, again!

01:40.391 --> 01:43.144
<i>There's no point in trying not to fall.</i>

01:43.144 --> 01:46.106
You always fall.
But the trick is

01:46.106 --> 01:48.900
you get up, you dust yourself off,

01:48.900 --> 01:52.821
and make sure you don't become dust.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.117
Charles, are you okay?

01:58.451 --> 02:01.246
What do you need? We're here.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.165
What do I do?

02:05.792 --> 02:07.502
I can't wash her down the drain! Ah!

02:08.503 --> 02:10.505
M-Maybe we could...

02:10.505 --> 02:12.173
get a wipe?

02:12.173 --> 02:15.426
Yes. Yes, a nice, respectful wipe.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.138
Sazz can't end up on a wipe.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.515
Well, you could just leave them like that.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.394
Then, you'd have permanent
Sazz hands.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.731
I'd like to take that one back.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.026
I'm gonna call the police.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.236
- Okay.
- Great. Yeah.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.245
- Do you want me to--
- No.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.374
I know what I'll do.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.959
I'll wash her into a bowl.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.210
- Great plan.
- A bowl!

02:49.210 --> 02:52.255
Then, I can take the water and ashes,
pour 'em into something,

02:52.255 --> 02:54.382
let the water evaporate.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.092
Maybe a Mason jar!

02:56.092 --> 02:58.636
- Oh, homey. Cozy. What a good-- That--
- Yes, a Mason jar.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.848
- I love Mason jars.
- And we will go get that for you now.

03:01.848 --> 03:02.932
Yes.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.776
Sazz...

03:35.715 --> 03:37.425
Ah!

04:03.409 --> 04:05.828
Hey, hey, hey, don't sweat it.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.999
Me being dead is
the least of your <i>problemos.</i>

04:09.999 --> 04:12.794
Also, get your hands off my boobs.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.263
<i>Um...</i>

05:09.892 --> 05:13.187
Oh, God, she's all over me, too!

05:13.187 --> 05:15.356
'Course this is the week my dry cleaner
bumps up his pricing.

05:15.356 --> 05:19.360
Oliver, will you stop shaking Sazz
onto the floor and line up the shot?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.863
Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry.
O-Okay. So-- Alright.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.491
So, if that's where Sazz was hit,

05:25.491 --> 05:28.244
then the angle puts the shooter

05:28.244 --> 05:29.746
in the corner apartment across the way.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.706
But, what if...

05:31.706 --> 05:33.958
she was shot here and then fell?

05:34.375 --> 05:37.003
Then, she was shot by the--

05:37.003 --> 05:39.339
the window next door.
Okay!

05:39.339 --> 05:41.132
My hands are clean.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.051
Sazz is in the jar,

05:43.051 --> 05:44.177
not in this room.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.095
I'm gonna put her right here.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.764
Okay, s-- Wait, no!

05:47.764 --> 05:49.307
I'm gonna put her here

05:49.307 --> 05:51.684
because Sazz used to love
sitting on this counter.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.061
So, this is absolutely--

05:53.061 --> 05:54.562
Unless we put her over--

05:54.562 --> 05:57.148
No, this is good.
This is absolutely good

05:57.148 --> 05:59.817
because it is time to enact protocol.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.152
Let's call the police.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.363
- Hold on! Hold on.
- Wait! I mean,

06:03.363 --> 06:06.908
- yes, do what you need to do.
- Whatever you need.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.285
Absolutely, Charles.
It's just that we thought

06:09.285 --> 06:12.288
maybe we could talk to some people

06:12.288 --> 06:14.791
before the whole building...

06:14.791 --> 06:16.834
comes under siege.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.131
Okay. What do we know so far?

06:22.131 --> 06:25.843
Okay, so Sazz came up here for the wine.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.679
There's a bullet hole in the glass.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.140
And I found a couple of shards
on the window seal,

06:31.140 --> 06:33.810
so it seems the bullet came in, not out.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.188
And also, Howard's cadaver dog
thinks there was a body about here,

06:37.188 --> 06:38.815
and then dragged to the trash chute

06:38.815 --> 06:40.942
by someone who had
access to your apartment,

06:40.942 --> 06:42.860
which is terrifying.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.863
And we know we found
Sazz in the incinerator.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.698
Poor Sazz.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.783
Poor Sazz.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.702
I wish I had something to add,
but I'm just a manifestation

06:51.702 --> 06:54.872
of your rapidly declining
mental state, so...

06:55.498 --> 06:58.000
The shot came from the West Tower,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.628
probably somewhere
across on the 14th floor.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.172
But we need to know
exactly where the body was

07:03.172 --> 07:04.841
to know which apartment.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.261
Oh! We could Luminol the floors!
I could Postmates us a bottle.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.345
Yes!

07:09.345 --> 07:12.014
A-And what is Luminol,
my little murder nerds?

07:12.014 --> 07:14.434
It's a chemical that makes
blood glow in the dark.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.104
Also, other bodily fluids.
That's how I found out

07:18.104 --> 07:20.398
what the construction workers
were doing in my old apartment.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.649
Ew.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.902
I don't get it. Who would kill Sazz?
Everybody loves Sazz.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.947
Well, remember,

07:27.947 --> 07:30.992
the shooter was in the Arconia,

07:30.992 --> 07:33.536
focusing on... your apartment.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.581
And they shot a person dressed like you

07:36.581 --> 07:38.082
in your kitchen.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.500
You see where this is going!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.711
I see where this is going!

07:41.711 --> 07:43.337
You think I was the target?

07:43.337 --> 07:44.630
That's preposterous!

07:44.630 --> 07:48.259
I was <i>People</i> magazine's
8th Most Beloved TV Cop!

07:48.259 --> 07:50.136
In 1989.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.262
'91.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.346
Hmm.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.725
Okay, clearly Sazz was
into something weird,

07:55.725 --> 07:58.895
but what about these notes
we found in her apartment?

07:58.895 --> 08:01.606
You got-- Look, look.
"Sick pup."

08:01.606 --> 08:03.691
This one just has random numbers.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.735
Yeah.
-"Dudenoff."

08:06.611 --> 08:08.446
No idea what that means.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.909
"Looking at Charles."

08:12.909 --> 08:16.287
It's a mistake to make assumptions
this early in an investigation.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.039
Don't let them get in your head.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.207
If you were the target,

08:19.207 --> 08:20.833
it means I was killed because of you,

08:20.833 --> 08:23.419
and that kind of guilt will paralyze you.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.004
We don't know who the target was!

08:27.798 --> 08:28.925
Listen,

08:28.925 --> 08:31.969
buddy, m-maybe we make lists of people

08:31.969 --> 08:35.181
who, uh, hate you
and people who hated Sazz.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.142
Might be fastest to start with Sazz.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.644
Ah...

08:39.644 --> 08:42.855
Sazz was dating Jan, a convicted murderer,

08:42.855 --> 08:45.191
and Sazz said she needed
to break up with Jan.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.152
And we know what Jan does to
people who break up with her.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.488
Okay, but Jan is in prison,

08:50.488 --> 08:52.949
and you broke up with her, too.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.826
Right. I'm calling 911.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.079
It's been a week, and Sazz's
Bulgarian left shoulder and knee

08:58.079 --> 08:59.622
are still in that incinerator.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.876
<i>911. Are you in immediate danger?</i>

09:03.876 --> 09:05.920
No! There's no proof of that!

09:05.920 --> 09:08.130
<i>Alright, then please hold.</i>

09:08.130 --> 09:09.715
<i>Thank you for calling 911.</i>

09:09.715 --> 09:13.302
<i>There are... 68...
emergencies ahead of you.</i>

09:13.302 --> 09:15.054
Sixty-eight!

09:15.054 --> 09:19.517
Okay, it looks like our glorious city
has given us a minute.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.228
Why don't we talk through
what we know about the residents

09:22.228 --> 09:23.980
of the West Tower?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.232
Ah...

09:27.108 --> 09:30.111
The Westies.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.656
They're an odd bunch. Weirdos.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.241
Loners.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.492
Renters.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.661
You don't have to say it like that.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.955
Yeah, boomer,
not everyone was alive

09:40.955 --> 09:43.833
when an apartment cost a bag of beans.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.501
I'd kill to rent anything.

09:45.501 --> 09:49.046
Alright, Charles.
Tell us about the Westies

09:49.755 --> 09:52.592
and why they might, for argument's sake,

09:52.592 --> 09:54.218
want you dead.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.886
There's Stink-Eye Joe.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.598
Seems hostile.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.600
Always looking over here,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.019
giving me the stink-eye.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.563
Ah.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.857
There's the Sauce Family.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.526
Always stirring some kind of sauce

10:10.526 --> 10:12.612
at all hours

10:12.612 --> 10:14.864
and looking over here.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.783
Three people, lots of pots,

10:17.783 --> 10:20.494
always stirring.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.706
Are they stirring up
a nice batch o' murder?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.583
There's the oddest one of all.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.918
Christmas-all-the-Time Guy.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.129
Handsome guy, always working out.

10:30.129 --> 10:33.090
Never takes down
his Christmas decorations.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.177
Wears a Christmas sweater all-year-round.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.555
That's most of the floor I can see.

10:39.555 --> 10:43.351
Besides that one apartment
that never opens its blinds.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.146
I see the lights go on and off sometimes,

10:47.146 --> 10:49.148
but I never see anyone in there.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.484
Interesting.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.944
Okay, let's sniff around
before the cops come.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.781
I think we have to go down
around the block to get in, right?

10:56.781 --> 10:59.659
That's right. They sealed off
the West Tower from the real Arconia

10:59.659 --> 11:01.285
after a Westie opened a brothel.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.578
Pretty good one, too.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.874
Okay, Charles, text us when 911 picks up.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:08.250 --> 11:11.170
Sazz was my stunt double.
I wanna investigate.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.630
Listen,

11:12.630 --> 11:16.008
I know we don't know who the target was,

11:16.008 --> 11:17.677
but just to be safe,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.929
why don't you help out in here?

11:19.929 --> 11:23.015
With the blinds closed.
Stay on hold.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.644
Make a new murder board.
Um, Postmates the Luminol.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.563
Luminol! Postmates.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.941
It was the most technical we'd ever been.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.737
You know this is all happening.
We might as well just get started.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.827
Hey!

11:42.827 --> 11:44.745
You're giving me busy work!

11:44.745 --> 11:48.624
Charles, this is a big job.
We need you to stay safe in here.

11:48.624 --> 11:49.875
- And stay on hold.
- Yeah.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.502
- You don't need to go out there to help.
- Right.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.379
'Course, they tried to shoot you in here.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.256
I was not the target!

11:56.424 --> 11:58.342
Of course, you weren't!

11:58.342 --> 12:01.095
But deadbolt the door.
The killer might have had a key.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.722
We love you, buddy.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.598
We do.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.684
I want to have said that.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.732
Charles, deadbolt!

12:16.694 --> 12:19.655
Okay, he is talking to no one.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.991
Hey, I've talked to
a few dead people before.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.910
Hey, I once invented a whole Fosse number
of you and Charles dancing.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.496
- You had better gams.
- Hey, what's that?

12:27.913 --> 12:29.039
"Building meeting tonight.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.709
"Keep our home from being overrun

12:31.709 --> 12:33.210
by a Hollywood movie shoot."

12:33.210 --> 12:35.671
No, no, no, no.
This movie has to happen.

12:35.671 --> 12:39.675
It's the only way I can keep up
with my sexy, successful girlfriend.

12:39.675 --> 12:43.095
Also, did you know Loretta's
co-star is internet famous

12:43.095 --> 12:45.973
for something called
a "Jon Hamm-in-the-pants situation"?

12:45.973 --> 12:48.559
Oh, I know.
Went deep down that rabbit hole

12:48.559 --> 12:50.644
one rainy afternoon.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.188
<i>Gates of Heaven.</i>

12:52.188 --> 12:53.981
<i>You ever seen it?
It's the first time</i>

12:53.981 --> 12:56.358
<i>I ever saw real people
just being themselves</i>

12:56.358 --> 12:58.819
<i>and being worthy as characters, too.</i>

12:58.819 --> 13:01.947
It was about pet cemeteries.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.074
But with some...

13:04.074 --> 13:07.453
deep existential shit about the afterlife.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.331
<i>And not for the dead so much, I really--</i>

13:10.331 --> 13:12.541
You've been on film hundreds of times,

13:12.541 --> 13:15.085
and the only way the world
will remember your face

13:15.085 --> 13:16.420
is on this old documentary.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.297
Well,

13:18.297 --> 13:21.550
being on film is not
the only way to be remembered.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.722
You know, even if you were the target,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.850
you don't have to feel bad.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.352
That's the gig.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.187
I take hits for my guy.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.861
They're just trying to scare me.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.696
I'm not gonna get scared
in my own apart--

13:46.784 --> 13:48.035
Closet.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.372
Don't know why I'm whispering.
I'm just your subconscious.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.263
Hello, Charles.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.019
Yep. She's real.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.820
Wow... The West Tower.

14:24.446 --> 14:28.075
Somewhere in this pit lay a sniper's nest.

14:28.075 --> 14:31.203
Okay, this is our one chance
to meet people casually

14:31.203 --> 14:34.164
before the cops put everyone on alert.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.625
So, let's look out some windows and chat.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.794
- Look for the weird.
- Okay, first up,

14:38.794 --> 14:41.714
the menacing Stink-Eye Joe.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.302
Okay.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.764
Hey!

14:50.764 --> 14:54.143
It's the famous podcasters
from the East Tower!

14:54.143 --> 14:57.479
- Why, yes, that's us.
- Uh, hi, I'm Mabel.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.064
I don't know if you're aware,

14:59.064 --> 15:01.817
but they're going to be shooting
a movie here based on our podcast.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.528
A movie?
Yes, major stars. Very exciting.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.864
So we're scouting possible
locations to shoot from.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.074
- In! To shoot in.
- Exactly.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.327
With cameras.
N-N-Not bang-bang shoot.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.411
Yeah.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.538
So would you be interested
in showing us your apartment?

15:14.538 --> 15:17.541
Oh, yeah! I love the movies!

15:17.541 --> 15:20.252
I'll show you anything you want!
Come on in!

15:22.630 --> 15:24.214
Vince Fish.

15:24.214 --> 15:27.384
Listen, I got to apologize
for the eye patch.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.803
I have antibiotic-resistant pink eye,

15:29.803 --> 15:32.806
and it leaves one eye,
and then goes back into the other,

15:32.806 --> 15:34.642
and then back and forth
and back and forth like a--

15:34.642 --> 15:37.394
like a virus playing hopscotch!
Anyhoo...

15:37.394 --> 15:39.438
I gotta put a compress on it,

15:39.438 --> 15:41.523
but I don't like to hold it in my hands

15:41.523 --> 15:44.860
because I'm highly contagious, okay?

15:44.860 --> 15:46.612
So, I came up with this system!

15:46.612 --> 15:48.656
- Ah, pink eye. Yes.
- That's a good idea.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.741
S-So, would you mind if
we glance out your window

15:50.741 --> 15:52.868
to see if it gives us
the right angle on the East Tower?

15:52.868 --> 15:54.620
Yeah, yeah, come on over!

15:54.620 --> 15:58.165
Yeah, I-I mean, you get a good
vantage point from over here.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.709
Everybody looks so small.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.878
You could pretend that
they're not even people.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.048
They're just like little ants,
and you just squish 'em!

16:06.048 --> 16:07.967
You just squish 'em!

16:07.967 --> 16:10.219
But I can see your place, Oliver.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.221
Over there on 10.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.390
And, uh, Mabel,

16:14.390 --> 16:16.976
y-you used to live at 12, and...

16:17.893 --> 16:19.019
there's your friend's place.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.856
What's up with him and his lonely omelets?

16:22.856 --> 16:24.358
And why is he always staring?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.903
Well, who could say why
people do what they do.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.072
Anyway, a shot from here won't work

16:30.072 --> 16:32.658
because th-the windows are painted shut.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.121
Oh. Um...
- Ow.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.248
That's too bad.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.710
Yeah.
Must be hard for you Easties to imagine.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.795
You're always lifting your windows,

16:44.795 --> 16:47.256
and letting in the fresh air.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.259
Anyhow! I'm going to the neighbors
to play some <i>Oh Hell,</i>

16:50.259 --> 16:53.637
so if you wanna come along, you can.
You can check out their place, right?

16:53.637 --> 16:55.139
- Uh-- Yes.
- Oh, that would be fantastic.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.725
- We'd love that.
- Yeah, super! New friends!

17:02.021 --> 17:04.606
Back! Stay back.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.650
How did you get out of prison?

17:06.650 --> 17:08.777
A mix of parkour Sazz taught me

17:08.777 --> 17:11.321
and psychosexual manipulation.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.408
I won't bore or arouse you with deets.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.744
Well, I'm not bored.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.163
And thanks for the tip
about the secret passageways

17:19.163 --> 17:20.831
in the second season of your podcast.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.124
Super helpful.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.376
Charles! Stop scurrying!

17:27.421 --> 17:28.964
I'm not here to kill you.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.967
I broke out because
I'm worried about Sazz.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.886
Worried about Sazz? What, why?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.221
She called last week and sounded upset.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.098
I haven't heard from her since.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.183
Have you?

17:39.183 --> 17:41.143
<i>Thank you for calling 911.</i>

17:41.143 --> 17:43.437
<i>There are... 32...
emergencies ahead of you.</i>

17:44.438 --> 17:45.939
Charles.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.567
Why did you call 911?

17:48.567 --> 17:51.820
- I'll tell you, if you don't kill me.
- I'll kill you if you don't tell me.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.906
<i>Touché.</i>

17:55.199 --> 17:57.201
Oh.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.204
I've been meaning to wash these.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.005
We're really more like family over here.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.882
You know, the apartments may be smaller,

18:11.882 --> 18:14.093
- but the hearts are bigger.
- Oh.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.637
Maybe that's why
I have an enlarged heart.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.100
Inez!

18:21.100 --> 18:24.144
We have guests!

18:25.229 --> 18:27.731
Fresh meat!

18:27.731 --> 18:28.857
Ha!

18:28.857 --> 18:31.068
- Get in here.
- Come on.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.863
Come on. Come on. Oh!

18:34.863 --> 18:37.241
Hi, there.
- Hi! Hi.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.663
Ah! Alfonso! <i>Mira!</i>
Yeah, <i>mami?</i>

18:42.663 --> 18:43.956
Fix your face.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.791
They wanna play <i>Oh Hell</i> with us.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.334
Oh!

18:47.334 --> 18:49.878
So nice to finally meet you!

18:49.878 --> 18:52.214
Right? A meeting of the towers.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.299
Wh-Why haven't we done this earlier?

18:54.299 --> 18:57.177
- My mom wishes you brought your friend.
- Ana!

18:57.177 --> 18:58.554
She's right, though.

18:58.554 --> 19:02.099
Mm-hmm.
Inez is in love with Brazzos.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.183
Ah...

19:03.183 --> 19:04.935
No, seriously.
When we first moved in,

19:04.935 --> 19:07.688
she spotted him across the courtyard,
almost peed herself.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.150
I thought I was gonna have to
take the guy out, you know?

19:11.150 --> 19:14.153
Wow. Years of living across from your...

19:14.153 --> 19:16.029
wife's crush must be hard, huh?

19:16.029 --> 19:18.365
Especially when your wife
puts on a push-up bra to cook.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.910
Can I help it if Brazzos
likes to watch me make sauce?

19:21.910 --> 19:23.954
Mom! I need to move out.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.497
Alright, come on, come on.
Let's get started.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.749
You're gonna love this game.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.585
But be careful.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.671
It's a little dangerous.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.720
Ah-ha!

19:39.720 --> 19:41.346
So?

19:41.346 --> 19:43.682
What do you think of <i>Oh Hell?</i>

19:43.682 --> 19:47.728
Well, it's, uh, titillating.
A little confusing.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.564
Reminds me of this traumatic game
of strip <i>Pinochle</i> I once played

19:50.564 --> 19:54.151
with the wonderful Frank Langella,
wh-whose drapes do not match the--

19:54.151 --> 19:55.652
He definitely loves it.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.404
So, Mabel, did you achieve?

19:57.404 --> 19:58.906
I don't think so.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.575
Oh.
- Okay, I really, really want to.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.493
Why am I so obsessed already?

20:03.493 --> 20:04.870
- It's so addictive.
- Mm.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.873
I bet your friend Mr. Savage
would like it.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.375
He's my hall pass. You know.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.377
Which is not supposed to be a thing

20:12.377 --> 20:14.755
with anyone you actually
have a chance of meeting

20:14.755 --> 20:16.089
or, you know,

20:16.089 --> 20:19.051
anyone who's constantly staring through
your window with his stupid fuckin' face.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.345
Dad, I think you can relax about Brazzos.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.513
He has brittle bones.
Mom would shatter him.

20:23.513 --> 20:26.308
I'd sure like to try!

20:26.308 --> 20:28.352
Where's this one running off to?

20:28.352 --> 20:30.896
I just need a pick-me-up.
Where's the knife?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.774
Oh, um, on the bathroom sink.
I just sharpened it.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.322
Mm.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.242
Alright! Now, I need a hit.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.702
You can't resist!

20:45.702 --> 20:47.287
That's my baby!

20:58.465 --> 21:01.301
So, wh-what is going on in the bathroom?

21:01.301 --> 21:04.137
Sorry. Westie secret.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.764
A sniper?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.686
Snipers are assholes.

21:11.436 --> 21:15.065
What's the point of killing
if you're not up close for the release?

21:15.065 --> 21:16.858
That's the best part.

21:16.858 --> 21:19.111
You remember, Charles?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.739
I really loved her.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.786
We worked together almost 40 years.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.371
She took every blow for me.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.581
We'd come to the most
dangerous part of the scene,

21:31.581 --> 21:33.500
and the director would yell, "Freeze,"

21:33.500 --> 21:36.545
and I would freeze.
And then Sazz would say...

21:36.545 --> 21:39.131
- Tap in.
-"...Tap in." And then,

21:40.007 --> 21:43.010
she would get run over by an airboat
while I had a Fresca.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.679
She couldn't find much doubling work

21:45.679 --> 21:47.764
because her height
didn't match many women.

21:49.599 --> 21:53.353
She said you gave her
the shot that started her life.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.563
She loved you.

21:54.563 --> 21:58.108
Jeez. This is getting sappy.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.402
She's the reason I haven't killed you,

22:00.402 --> 22:03.196
despite hours of fantasizing.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.199
Well, thank you, Sazz.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.243
Now, I need to borrow a shirt.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.162
This one's covered in prison guard brain.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.084
Prison guard brain?

22:16.084 --> 22:17.753
That's our Jan.

22:18.712 --> 22:19.755
Oh, hell!

22:20.505 --> 22:22.424
Wow! I needed that!

22:24.217 --> 22:26.136
B-A-D!

22:27.054 --> 22:29.973
[gasps] Oh! You won!
- Oh! I achieved?

22:29.973 --> 22:32.642
I achieved!

22:32.642 --> 22:34.102
You did it?
- Oh, my God!

22:34.102 --> 22:37.314
Oh, I missed it!
Okay, newbie.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.150
I think that earns you
a trip to the bathroom.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.777
Here you go, buddy.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.280
Oh. I-I don't know that I-I need to--

22:45.280 --> 22:48.075
He's right, you earned it.
Ollie.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.702
I insist.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.914
Get in there. Get in there.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.416
Get in there. Get in there.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.627
Get in there! Get in there!
Take the knife!

22:58.627 --> 22:59.920
Come on!
Get in there!

22:59.920 --> 23:03.632
Get in there!
Get in there! Get in there!

23:03.632 --> 23:06.635
Get in there! Get in there!

23:06.635 --> 23:09.054
Take that knife!

23:10.931 --> 23:13.016
Get in there!

23:14.434 --> 23:15.477
Is that a person?

23:15.977 --> 23:18.480
Don't be ridiculous. It's a ham.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.857
Imported from Portugal, very special.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.945
It's a ham, Mabel!
It's a ham in the shower!

23:24.945 --> 23:27.114
Yeah!
- Go get it!

23:27.114 --> 23:28.365
Alright!

23:28.365 --> 23:30.200
Alright!

23:30.200 --> 23:33.787
So, uh, it sounds like we've met most
everybody on this side of the floor

23:33.787 --> 23:36.790
except for Christmas Guy
and whoever is in that place

23:36.790 --> 23:39.709
with the lockbox on it.
Who lives there?

23:39.709 --> 23:41.670
Oh, um, that's the Dudenoff place.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.840
Dudenoff?

23:44.840 --> 23:47.676
Do you know how we could contact them?

23:50.637 --> 23:52.389
I don't even think he has a telephone.

23:54.516 --> 23:57.102
Sazz was very worried about you, Charles.

23:57.102 --> 24:00.147
And the day's looking up.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.190
She said she thought
someone had eyes on you.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.985
She was poking around
the building because of it.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.779
This building? She was looking into
someone who lives here?

24:07.779 --> 24:10.240
I don't know,
but last time we talked,

24:10.240 --> 24:13.410
she said she thought there might be
another murderer in the building.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.664
It was last Wednesday,
after my Lifers' Hip-Hop Dance Club.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.458
That was the night she died.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.501
Charles, you get rid of the body

24:21.501 --> 24:23.753
because you've killed the wrong person,

24:23.753 --> 24:25.922
and you don't want
the right person on alert.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.093
And, trust me, once you've crossed
over and tried to kill,

24:30.093 --> 24:32.012
if you fail,

24:32.012 --> 24:35.515
you come up with way more
fucked-up ways to finish the job.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.559
Time to go.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.603
Charles!
Open up!

24:39.603 --> 24:42.564
Stupid cops are gonna pin this on me,

24:42.564 --> 24:45.442
so I gotta disappear.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.820
I was hoping to make love one last time,
Charles, before you're murdered.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.740
Maybe at least some mutual masturbation,
but ships passing, I guess.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.824
Where are you?

24:52.824 --> 24:54.993
- Well, you know, we got a little time...
- I'll miss you, Charles.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.661
I hope it's quick. Woof!

24:58.997 --> 25:00.999
Open up!
Open the door!

25:00.999 --> 25:02.375
Charles!
Charles!

25:03.627 --> 25:06.338
Hi! Okay, so the apartment
with the closed blinds

25:06.338 --> 25:09.049
is someone named Dudenoff.
From Sazz's note!

25:09.049 --> 25:10.675
Now, we don't know who that is,

25:10.675 --> 25:12.886
but the Westies are very weird about it.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.305
Also, they eat toilet ham.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.848
What?
And Stink-Eye Joe

25:16.848 --> 25:18.517
- is really just Pink-Eye Joe.
- Yeah.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.269
Which is arguably worse, but--
You made a board!

25:21.269 --> 25:22.729
Oh, that's so good!

25:22.729 --> 25:24.940
Who knows why Sazz was over there,

25:24.940 --> 25:28.068
but there is a lockbox
on that Dudenoff door.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.152
Guys.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.623
Jan was here. She was here!

25:41.623 --> 25:43.792
Jan was here?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.544
Yeah!
Uh-huh...

25:45.544 --> 25:47.003
And is she still here?

25:47.003 --> 25:48.338
Well, I didn't-- Ah!

25:48.338 --> 25:49.714
Can't you still smell her?

25:49.714 --> 25:51.841
I can. [inhales deeply] Mm.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.179
- Charles, Jan is in prison.
- Yeah.

25:56.179 --> 25:58.265
How could she be in your closet?

25:58.265 --> 25:59.516
Parkour.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.811
Ah.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.063
And that is when we realized

26:05.063 --> 26:08.900
that Charles had begun
his descent into madness.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.694
Guys, I was the target.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.571
The shot was for me.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.823
Sazz died for me.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.408
<i>Thank you for calling 911.</i>

26:16.408 --> 26:19.327
<i>There are... 19...
emergencies ahead of you.</i>

26:19.327 --> 26:22.247
- Okay! You're doing good at hold.
- Yeah.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.748
Uh, did you order the Luminol?

26:23.748 --> 26:26.251
It's on its way.
Good for you, dude!

26:26.251 --> 26:28.837
- We're proud of ya.
- H-Hey, Oliver.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.797
Look. The numbers.
Is that the code

26:30.797 --> 26:33.341
- for the lockbox?
- Maybe.

26:34.509 --> 26:37.053
W-We're gonna try to get
into the Dudenoff place

26:37.053 --> 26:39.556
as fast as possible,
and then we'll be back.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.933
Okay, just text us if the cops pick up

26:41.933 --> 26:44.519
or the Luminol comes.
You're doing great.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.859
Charles isn't doing so great.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.486
Yeah, we have to find the killer soon.
He's a dead man walking.

26:53.486 --> 26:56.448
Oh, goody, it works.

27:09.085 --> 27:12.964
Okay, if anyone actually lives here,
they're definitely a psychopath.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.593
A ham radio.
So much ham up here.

27:25.268 --> 27:26.686
Hey.

27:26.686 --> 27:29.856
Look, there's a footprint on the radiator.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.150
And paint chips.
The window was pried open.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.112
Ah!

27:37.155 --> 27:39.407
This must be the sniper's nest.

27:40.784 --> 27:43.787
It's also pretty spacious for a studio.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.999
Ho, ho, ho.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.628
Is this tinsel?

27:52.337 --> 27:53.713
Oliver!

27:53.713 --> 27:55.715
What!?
More ham!

27:57.801 --> 28:00.679
He's so cute! What's your name?

28:00.679 --> 28:03.765
Piggie Smalls?
Notorious P.I.G.?

28:03.765 --> 28:05.058
Jesus!

28:05.058 --> 28:06.601
Oh shit.

28:19.614 --> 28:20.699
Oh!

28:20.699 --> 28:22.325
Shh!

28:25.328 --> 28:26.329
Wait.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.929
The pig's loose!

28:42.929 --> 28:45.724
Well, at least he has a chance.
Go!

28:48.351 --> 28:51.354
Let's gather up some things
and get outta here.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.815
I'm scared to leave here now.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.400
We stay down here.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.069
Nice and safe.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.488
Forever.

29:02.073 --> 29:05.076
Many cultures sit on the floor to eat.
It'll be great.

29:07.537 --> 29:10.039
<i>Thank you for calling 911.</i>

29:10.039 --> 29:12.000
<i>There are... eight...
emergencies ahead of you.</i>

29:12.000 --> 29:13.585
We're almost there.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.470
That would be the Luminol.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.181
Downstairs.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.266
You don't have to go down there.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.020
Delegate.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.607
Let strangers find the killer
of your fiercest protector.

29:43.239 --> 29:45.742
I've gotta at least go get the box.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.662
Just gotta, uh, pick up a package.

29:49.662 --> 29:52.540
That's easy. I pick up a package
without getting kil-- Ew.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.918
Uh-- Okay.

29:54.918 --> 29:58.379
I'll go in disguise-- Oh.
I'll go in disguise. Alright.

29:58.379 --> 30:01.007
I'll say to Lester,
"Don't look up and don't say my name,

30:01.007 --> 30:02.550
but give me that package."

30:02.550 --> 30:04.302
NYPD!
Don't kill me!

30:05.637 --> 30:08.139
- Savage, are you safe?
- What? I don't know, am I?

30:08.139 --> 30:11.226
Jan Bellows escaped using parkour
and psychosexual manipulation.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.479
Then, we found sketches of her doing
some really fucked-up shit to you.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.189
Acid showers, golden showers.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.857
Now, I'm not really sure
how that kills anyone,

30:17.857 --> 30:19.317
but we need to inspect your bathroom.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.903
See? She is real! She was here!

30:24.489 --> 30:25.824
She was here?

30:26.199 --> 30:28.910
And you didn't report it,
which you know is a crime?

30:31.329 --> 30:33.331
Savage, is there anything
you wanna tell me?

30:33.331 --> 30:35.416
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

30:39.337 --> 30:40.672
<i>Hello?</i>

30:41.881 --> 30:43.925
I'd like to report a murder.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.846
Shut the fuckin' fuck up.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.681
You might wanna check the incinerator.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.560
Also, we grabbed your package.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.397
<i>Sir, did you say a murder?</i>

31:03.528 --> 31:06.781
Come on, let's go.
Cops won't be in the basement forever.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.825
Are we allowed to do this
to a crime scene?

31:08.825 --> 31:11.202
Forgiveness instead of permission
is kind of our thing.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.746
Okay.
And what does this Luminol do again?

31:13.746 --> 31:15.665
It'll show us where Sazz bled out.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.166
- Uh-huh.
- Are you ready?

31:18.334 --> 31:19.711
I...

31:19.711 --> 31:21.963
I need a moment first.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.074
I failed you today, Sazz.

31:50.617 --> 31:54.704
Well,
I wasn't at my best either.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.665
And I'm you, so, yeah.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.501
- We lost our shit.
- Hm.

32:00.501 --> 32:03.588
How am I ever gonna find your killer
if I'm afraid to go outside?

32:04.172 --> 32:07.675
I don't know how to do this.
All I know how to do is freeze.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.594
You need a stunt double.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.389
- Remember in season one...
- Mm.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.893
...we had that big explosion stunt
at the strip club?

32:16.893 --> 32:18.186
- Mm-hmm.
- And for hours,

32:18.186 --> 32:20.688
you were running and diving in this, uh,

32:20.688 --> 32:22.440
filthy river.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.735
- Yeah. My hair caught on fire. Yeah.
- Your hair caught on fire.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.320
And that was all before lunch.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.156
Which I was having, uh,

32:30.156 --> 32:32.241
alone, as usual.

32:33.242 --> 32:34.744
And then,

32:35.620 --> 32:37.288
you came banging on my trailer door,

32:37.288 --> 32:39.540
and you brought in five crew guys

32:39.540 --> 32:41.417
that I had never talked to,

32:41.417 --> 32:45.296
and they all thanked me
for inviting them to a poker game

32:46.089 --> 32:48.216
- which I hadn't.
- Little white lie.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.717
And then,

32:49.717 --> 32:52.303
I had this weekly poker game

32:52.303 --> 32:54.389
for the next eight years.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.184
You found me friends.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.522
What was that guy? Th-The grip?

33:02.522 --> 33:04.732
He was so funny. And the,

33:04.732 --> 33:07.902
uh, big guy with the hair.
Was it Schma? Schma?

33:07.902 --> 33:09.320
- Schmeong.
- Schmeong.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.155
Yeah.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.241
You were more than just a stunt double.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.078
You took care of me

33:17.078 --> 33:19.872
in every way a person
could take care of someone.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.043
You're my oldest,

33:24.043 --> 33:26.045
best friend.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.049
What'll I do without you?

33:38.016 --> 33:41.477
Charles? We should do this.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.739
She was right here.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.041
Hey. Look at this.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.754
Did she write a message with her blood?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.424
Charles, do you know what that means?

34:13.092 --> 34:14.594
Yes.

34:15.386 --> 34:16.679
I do.

34:18.222 --> 34:21.517
<i>Another thing my father taught me.
If you wanna have a long career,</i>

34:21.517 --> 34:24.062
<i>you need to find your person.</i>

34:24.604 --> 34:26.397
<i>Your number one.</i>

34:26.397 --> 34:29.025
The one you always fall for.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.277
And the day I met Charles-Haden Savage,

34:32.487 --> 34:34.405
I knew I'd found mine.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.451
<i>And it's not just about a steady gig.</i>

34:38.451 --> 34:40.369
<i>Finding your number one pushes you</i>

34:40.369 --> 34:43.664
<i>to unlock parts of yourself
you didn't even know you had.</i>

34:49.921 --> 34:51.631
<i>Because everything you do,</i>

34:53.466 --> 34:55.468
<i>you're doing for someone you care about.</i>

34:59.931 --> 35:01.140
"Oh hell."

35:04.102 --> 35:06.229
They're not numbers.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.314
They're letters.

35:12.985 --> 35:15.613
Did one of them kill Sazz?

35:15.613 --> 35:17.698
We're gonna find out.

35:17.698 --> 35:20.409
We're not investigating
Sazz's murder anymore.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.788
We're investigating mine.
