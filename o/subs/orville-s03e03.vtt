WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:11.845
(adventurous music playing)

00:47.339 --> 00:50.300
(serene orchestral
music playing)

01:12.572 --> 01:14.199
(alert chimes)

01:14.282 --> 01:15.575
Come in.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.536
Hey! Welcome back.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.746
You're early.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.706
Yeah, well, if you spent a week
with my parents,

01:21.790 --> 01:23.083
you'd want to come
back to work too.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.626
You have a restful
trip at least?

01:24.709 --> 01:26.503
Yeah, you know, for
the most part.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.837
How are your mom and dad?

01:27.921 --> 01:31.257
My mom's good, my
dad's also good.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.884
He's his usual self.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.135
Work hard, play hard?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.887
I think the Fleet's
the only thing keeping him

01:35.970 --> 01:38.264
from pursuing a full-time career
as an alcoholic,

01:38.348 --> 01:40.350
but if the uniform's on,
we can handle it.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.601
Sounds relaxing.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.645
Compared to the
trip back, yeah.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.230
I put my report in your file.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.524
Report? You were on vacation.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.901
I picked up the residue of a
Kaylon quantum signature

01:49.984 --> 01:51.111
out by the Avior system.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.655
It was pretty faint, so my guess
is they're long gone,

01:53.738 --> 01:56.116
but anything near this sector
is concerning.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.659
What the hell would they
be doing out here?

01:57.742 --> 02:00.370
No idea. But I thought
the Captain should know.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.705
I'll make him aware.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.123
Permission to return to duty?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.207
Go to it.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.377
It's good to have you back.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.391
Oh, my God, these are insane.
Are you kidding me?

02:21.474 --> 02:23.309
Ooh. What are they called?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.478
Xelayan chocolate trusses.
My mom makes them.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.523
This is the most dense chocolate
I've ever tasted.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.191
Heavy gravity, heavy desserts.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.818
Bortus, you want one?

02:31.901 --> 02:34.320
No thank you. I am dieting.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.739
Since when?

02:35.822 --> 02:38.616
My shore leave is in 30 days.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.995
Klyden and I are visiting
the Belajok Sea on Moclus.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.914
Lieutenant Malloy has advised me
to get my...

02:44.998 --> 02:46.249
"summer body."

02:46.332 --> 02:49.586
You'll thank me.
Klyden'll thank me, too.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.088
ISAAC:
<i>Captain. This is most peculiar.</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:55.008
<i>I am detecting narrow-band</i>
<i>electromagnetic emissions</i>

02:55.091 --> 02:56.968
<i>from the surface of Narran 1,</i>

02:57.052 --> 03:00.221
<i>13.4 light-years</i>
<i>from our present position.</i>

03:00.305 --> 03:02.599
That's impossible.
You must be reading it wrong.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.185
<i>Negative. I am incapable</i>
<i>of error.</i>

03:05.268 --> 03:07.896
Narran 1 is a barren rock.
It always has been.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.564
Sir, I'm reading it too.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.608
Coherent pulses, not
background noise.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.778
Maybe somebody's down there.
Mining crew or something.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.031
<i>The electromagnetic emanations</i>
<i>are far too numerous.</i>

03:18.114 --> 03:20.325
<i>Such intense and modulated</i>
<i>signals</i>

03:20.408 --> 03:23.370
<i>can only be produced</i>
<i>by the collective energy output</i>

03:23.453 --> 03:25.955
<i>of a substantial population</i>
<i>of life forms.</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:29.292
Gordon, alter course
for Narran 1.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.835
Aye, sir.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.862
Isaac?

03:57.946 --> 04:00.407
<i>Scans are showing</i>
<i>industrial power sources</i>

04:00.490 --> 04:01.991
<i>and transportation networks,</i>

04:02.075 --> 04:03.410
<i>which would indicate</i>
<i>the presence</i>

04:03.493 --> 04:04.786
<i>of multiple advanced cities,</i>

04:04.869 --> 04:08.331
<i>all operating at a 25th-century</i>
<i>level of development.</i>

04:08.665 --> 04:11.292
<i>Planet-wide population</i>
<i>8.5 billion,</i>

04:11.376 --> 04:14.045
<i>concentrated mainly</i>
<i>in the northern hemisphere.</i>

04:14.129 --> 04:15.714
It has to be a mistake.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.966
Mercer to Lamarr.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.635
Confirm forward scanners
are functioning properly.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.763
Confirmed, Captain.
I'm seeing it here too.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.181
I have no explanation.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.350
Every Union record
of Narran 1,

04:27.434 --> 04:29.936
every scan ever taken,
shows a desolate world.

04:30.020 --> 04:33.314
<i>That is correct, Commander.</i>
<i>However, this scan does not.</i>

04:33.398 --> 04:34.649
Talla, hail them.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.735
-Hailing.
-(monitor beeps)

04:38.111 --> 04:40.572
Nothing. Let me try a
different channel.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.615
Scans show they have
the infrastructure

04:42.699 --> 04:45.410
for communication,
they're just not answering.

04:46.327 --> 04:47.537
Gordon, prep a shuttle.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.330
You, Bortus, and Talla
are with Kelly and I.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.125
Mercer to Lamarr, report to
the bridge and take the conn.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.543
-Charly.
-Aye, sir.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.678
(adventurous music playing)

05:34.501 --> 05:36.878
Gordon, verify landing
coordinates.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.339
Verified, Commander.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.925
We should be looking
at downtown Manhattan.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.802
Set us down.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.887
♪♪

06:14.791 --> 06:16.334
(monitor beeping)

06:20.797 --> 06:23.049
So much for our day
in the big city.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.386
Forget the city,
this shouldn't even be here.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.972
There are no forests
on Narran 1.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.519
Scans are confirming
what we're seeing.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.981
These trees go on for thousands
of square kilometers.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.607
Grayson to Orville.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.859
Lamarr here, Commander.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.402
I was just about to contact you.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.778
What are your scans showing?

06:43.862 --> 06:45.447
The cities are gone, sir.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.491
We're reading dense vegetation.
Forest all across the continent.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.118
-(monitor beeps)
-LT. CMDR. BORTUS: Captain.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.494
Look at this.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.205
What is it?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.041
Life forms.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.960
Several hundred humanoids,
in that direction.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.795
All right, let's go.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.839
Sir? Weapons?

07:04.174 --> 07:05.300
Yeah.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.886
(electronic whirring)

07:38.416 --> 07:40.210
(scanner beeping)

07:47.926 --> 07:50.095
What the hell...?

07:50.178 --> 07:51.930
(suspenseful music playing)

08:00.480 --> 08:02.482
(theme music playing)

09:36.326 --> 09:37.702
Mercer to Lamarr.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.496
LT. JOHN LAMARR: (over comm)
<i>Lamarr here. Go ahead.</i>

09:39.579 --> 09:42.290
Scan the immediate vicinity
of our location.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.209
We're just reading
the landing party, sir.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.419
ED MERCER: (over comm) <i>Just the</i>
<i>landing party? Nothing else?</i>

09:46.503 --> 09:47.545
Like what?

09:47.629 --> 09:49.297
A high school?

09:49.381 --> 09:50.882
LAMARR:
<i>Say again, Commander?</i>

09:50.965 --> 09:54.302
A high school.
Like a 21st-century high school.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.388
Lamarr, are you reading
a structure of any kind?

09:56.554 --> 09:57.555
LAMARR:
<i>Negative.</i>

09:57.639 --> 09:58.890
Just plant life.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.691
What is this place?

10:50.191 --> 10:51.526
An old Earth high school

10:51.609 --> 10:53.570
in the middle of the forest
on an alien plant.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.447
Completely normal. How's
<i>your </i>day going?

10:56.531 --> 10:58.408
(soft beeping)

10:58.491 --> 10:59.784
BORTUS:
Captain.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.745
We are not alone.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.707
Mercer to Orville.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.919
Mercer to Orville.
Lamarr, do you read?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.547
(door slams)

11:20.597 --> 11:21.556
Talla.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.442
(electricity zaps)

11:41.034 --> 11:42.160
Come on.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.836
(school bell rings)

11:55.215 --> 11:57.217
(students chattering)

12:09.938 --> 12:11.356
Um, do you mind?

12:12.315 --> 12:13.191
What?

12:13.692 --> 12:15.360
You're like right in
front of my locker.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.031
-(monitor beeps)
-LT. TALLA KEYALI: Captain.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.241
They read as human.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.369
Excuse me.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.412
Hm?

12:25.662 --> 12:26.788
Where are we?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.207
We're in the hallway?

12:29.290 --> 12:30.542
Who are you?

12:30.625 --> 12:31.876
Ashley.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.295
This is a fun conversation,
but I have to get to bio.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.967
Hey, hey. Um, what's
today's date?

12:39.050 --> 12:41.052
Uh, I think it's the 19th?

12:41.136 --> 12:43.013
No, no, th-the year.
What's the year?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.098
(laughs) What are you, high?

12:45.181 --> 12:47.350
Possibly, that's what I'm
trying to find out.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.105
Could it be time travel?

12:52.814 --> 12:55.734
I don't know...
somehow I don't think so.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.486
All right, first things first,
we need to find a way out.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.904
Kelly and I will search
this direction,

12:59.988 --> 13:01.740
the rest of you check
those corridors down there.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.241
We'll meet back here
in ten minutes.

13:07.162 --> 13:10.707
(school bell rings)

13:20.717 --> 13:22.761
Have you tried a subsurface
tomographic analysis

13:22.844 --> 13:24.679
-of the planet?
<i>-Affirmative.</i>

13:24.763 --> 13:27.265
<i>I have also run a</i>
<i>full biometric scan.</i>

13:27.349 --> 13:29.017
<i>The shuttle appears</i>
<i>to be intact,</i>

13:29.100 --> 13:31.019
<i>but there is no trace</i>
<i>of the landing party.</i>

13:31.102 --> 13:33.313
All right.
I'm sending down a rescue team.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.357
<i>Sir, that may not be wise.</i>

13:35.690 --> 13:37.275
<i>If they have been harmed,</i>

13:37.359 --> 13:39.694
<i>the same fate could befall</i>
<i>a second contingent.</i>

13:40.236 --> 13:42.238
They're our crewmates, Isaac.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.158
The Kaylon may throw people away
like garbage, but we don't.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.535
<i>It is not my intent</i>
<i>to minimize the value</i>

13:47.619 --> 13:48.703
<i>of the missing officers.</i>

13:48.787 --> 13:49.788
<i>I merely suggest--</i>

13:49.871 --> 13:51.247
Hey, we don't have time
to argue.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.540
Isaac, prep a second shuttle,

13:52.624 --> 13:54.376
and take a security detail
down to the surface.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.712
And bring Dr. Finn. They
may be injured.

13:57.796 --> 13:58.880
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

14:18.900 --> 14:22.028
(soft beeping)

14:26.408 --> 14:27.992
TEACHER:
So, by 1914,

14:28.076 --> 14:29.786
when things were close
to a boiling point,

14:29.869 --> 14:31.496
the European nations
found themselves

14:31.579 --> 14:33.081
divided into two factions:

14:33.164 --> 14:34.708
the Triple Entente,

14:34.791 --> 14:37.585
which included
Russia, England, and France,

14:37.669 --> 14:39.170
and the Triple Alliance,

14:39.254 --> 14:41.881
which consisted of
Germany, Italy...

14:42.215 --> 14:43.591
Can I help you?

14:44.259 --> 14:45.427
Perhaps.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.053
I am looking for a way out.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.597
Well, I think you should talk
to the guidance counselor.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.684
This is History 103.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.186
Are you supposed to
be in this class?

14:56.104 --> 14:58.356
Hey! Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

14:59.441 --> 15:01.276
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!

15:01.359 --> 15:03.319
Okay, if the two of you
don't leave right now,

15:03.403 --> 15:04.612
I'm calling the principal's
office!

15:04.696 --> 15:06.573
It's impenetrable,
just like the doors.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.158
It could be a forcefield
of some kind.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.285
Out, now!

15:20.086 --> 15:21.296
Where's Gordon?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.923
(electronic whirring)

15:25.633 --> 15:26.885
(beeping)

15:34.184 --> 15:36.102
-(grunting)
-Hey! Hey! What the hell!

15:38.063 --> 15:39.439
Uggh!

15:40.857 --> 15:42.275
What the hell is going on?
Who are you guys?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.902
-Shut up!
-What-- Uggh!

15:43.985 --> 15:44.986
(groans)

15:45.070 --> 15:46.780
Randall wants his
money, asshole!

15:46.863 --> 15:48.615
Who the hell is Randall?

15:49.074 --> 15:52.660
(grunting and panting)

15:52.786 --> 15:54.412
You're pissing him off, and
you're pissing us off,

15:54.496 --> 15:55.830
-now where is it?
-Guys,

15:55.914 --> 15:58.291
I-I seriously have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.751
I don't even know where I am.

15:59.834 --> 16:00.877
(groans)

16:00.960 --> 16:02.754
(grunts)

16:05.048 --> 16:06.257
Look! His comscanner.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.350
(grunts)

16:15.975 --> 16:17.727
(gurgling)

16:18.645 --> 16:20.605
Come on, where is it,
you little bitch?

16:20.689 --> 16:22.107
I swear to God,
I have no idea.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.859
(muffled groans)

16:26.361 --> 16:29.322
(panting) Okay, okay!
I'll get him...

16:29.406 --> 16:30.573
I'll get him his money, okay?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.534
I-I-I just don't have it
right now.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.327
All right? I-I need a
little more time!

16:34.411 --> 16:36.454
You got till 3:15 to pay up,

16:36.538 --> 16:39.290
or Randall's gonna put you
in a world of shit, you got me?

16:39.374 --> 16:41.084
Yeah. Yeah, yes. I gotcha.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.420
-Yeah?
-Uggh!

16:44.254 --> 16:45.547
(groaning)

16:45.922 --> 16:47.966
-(grunts)
-(groans)

16:49.259 --> 16:52.512
(pants)

16:57.726 --> 17:00.395
-(groans)
-Lieutenant. Are you all right?

17:00.478 --> 17:02.564
Yeah, I think so. (groans)

17:03.189 --> 17:05.692
-What happened?
-Those guys jumped me.

17:05.775 --> 17:06.860
Who were they?

17:07.444 --> 17:09.612
I have no idea, they
wouldn't tell me.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.657
(exhales sharply)

17:17.787 --> 17:19.247
My God, what happened?

17:19.330 --> 17:22.042
(sighs) I'm okay, Commander.
I just had a little run-in.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.085
-With who?
-Bullies.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.212
-What did they want?
-Money.

17:26.296 --> 17:29.090
They said I have till 3:15
to pay some guy named Randall.

17:29.174 --> 17:32.052
Captain. His wounds are real.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.347
Which means that even
if this is a hallucination...

17:36.056 --> 17:37.140
we can be hurt.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.850
We need answers.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.935
(students chattering)

17:53.490 --> 17:54.574
Now what?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.035
Find someone who
looks friendly.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.923
May we sit with you?

18:10.382 --> 18:11.299
No.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.509
Why not?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.386
Because our table's full.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.221
There are several
available seats.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.056
Not for you. (laughs)

18:18.139 --> 18:20.684
I am prepared to take
them by force.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.186
Bortus. Let's look
someplace else, huh?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.154
You have a five-head.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.240
(student gasping)

18:35.323 --> 18:36.950
-It's not true.
-No, you don't.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.160
Hey. Can we sit here?

18:39.244 --> 18:40.537
Sure.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.958
Jeez, what happened to you?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.793
Maybe you can tell <i>me.</i>

18:47.043 --> 18:49.087
Do any of you know a
guy named Randall?

18:49.170 --> 18:50.672
Yeah, of course.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.133
Oh, wait, dude, that's you?

18:53.258 --> 18:56.636
Well, I don't know. I-I w--
I was just told I owe him money.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.805
Yeah, everybody's been
talking about it.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.348
Dude, you gotta pay him.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.392
Pay him for what? Who is he?

19:02.475 --> 19:03.935
You pay him not
to beat you up.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.103
We've all been through it.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.646
I had to do it all
freshman year.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.440
Then I got like massive
on TikTok

19:08.523 --> 19:09.649
and he stopped messin' with me

19:09.733 --> 19:11.901
'cause my followers would
flame his Gram.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.361
What?

19:13.445 --> 19:14.446
They're saying that
he's gonna

19:14.529 --> 19:15.655
come looking for you
after school

19:15.739 --> 19:16.948
unless he gets the money.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.450
Where do we find this guy?

19:18.533 --> 19:20.160
He hangs out behind
the bleachers.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.037
And, what happens if
I don't pay him?

19:22.787 --> 19:23.913
You should pay him.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.962
(intense music playing)

19:44.559 --> 19:47.145
ISAAC: <i>All systems ready</i>
<i>for departure.</i>

19:47.228 --> 19:48.229
Let's go.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.703
(school bell rings)

20:15.799 --> 20:17.717
Come on, this could
be our way out.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.272
(scanner chirping)

20:32.482 --> 20:33.942
KEYALI: There's no sign
of the shuttle.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.820
Grayson to Orville.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.073
Ideas, anyone?

20:40.240 --> 20:43.910
Perhaps this "Randall"
could give us some information.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.246
Wait-wait, the Randall
who just had me beat up?

20:46.329 --> 20:48.039
The guy who wants to kill me?

20:48.123 --> 20:51.126
It's the only lead we have.
Maybe we can talk to him.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.545
All right, let's find
the bleachers.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.339
Great.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.104
We're looking for Randall.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.439
You found him.

21:14.816 --> 21:17.652
(feet pounding)

21:17.736 --> 21:19.112
Oh, shit!

21:20.989 --> 21:23.074
(snarling)

21:27.495 --> 21:29.748
(lasers firing)

21:37.464 --> 21:38.965
(roaring)

21:42.761 --> 21:44.054
(groaning)

22:29.933 --> 22:31.267
(seat belt alert chimes)

22:31.851 --> 22:33.269
What the hell is
going on here?

22:33.353 --> 22:35.438
(door slams)

22:44.447 --> 22:45.782
I'm gonna have
to ask you folks

22:45.865 --> 22:47.117
to please take your seats.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.576
We'll be landing soon.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.161
What do we do?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.581
I guess we sit.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.876
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

22:56.960 --> 22:58.837
<i>the Captain has turned off</i>
<i>the fasten seat belt sign</i>

22:58.920 --> 23:01.381
<i>and you are now free</i>
<i>to move about the cabin.</i>

23:01.464 --> 23:03.133
<i>For your continued safety,</i>
<i>we require...</i>

23:03.216 --> 23:04.718
It's the same as before.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.845
Pressurized oxygen atmosphere.

23:06.928 --> 23:10.306
As far as the scans can tell,
this is an ancient aircraft.

23:23.528 --> 23:24.779
Captain.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.825
Something happened when that
creature had me in the air.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.118
What do you mean?

23:30.326 --> 23:33.663
It was like my whole
brain froze.

23:34.247 --> 23:37.292
You know, I-I was there, but...

23:37.625 --> 23:38.710
but I wasn't.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.962
-Were you in shock?
-No, no, no.

23:41.046 --> 23:44.049
I-I mean, yeah, I was,
but I've been in shock before.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.634
This-- this was something
different.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.512
Perhaps whatever is causing
these hallucinations

23:49.596 --> 23:51.348
is affecting our minds
in other ways.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.142
We don't know
if these are hallucinations.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.728
I mean, you said yourself,
Gordon's injuries are real.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.189
And, I think until we get
to the bottom of this,

23:59.272 --> 24:01.983
we have to assume that
everything is.

24:12.285 --> 24:15.288
(adventurous music playing)

24:51.032 --> 24:52.117
Finn to Orville.

24:52.534 --> 24:53.660
Lamarr here.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.203
DR. CLAIRE FINN:
<i>We've reached the surface.</i>

24:55.412 --> 24:57.455
It's exactly what it's
supposed to be.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.374
Completely desolate.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.168
ISAAC: <i>Scans do not detect</i>
<i>any other life forms.</i>

25:02.252 --> 25:03.628
<i>We appear to be alone.</i>

25:03.712 --> 25:05.588
Any sign of the Captain's
shuttle?

25:05.672 --> 25:08.508
DR. FINN: It's here, at its
original landing coordinates.

25:08.591 --> 25:09.634
Stand by.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.084
Finn to Orville.

25:45.003 --> 25:46.463
They're gone.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.883
(thunder crashing)

26:02.187 --> 26:03.938
Um, excuse me, ma'am?

26:04.022 --> 26:07.650
Hi. Uh, I'm a pilot, and I just
wanted to let you know

26:07.734 --> 26:10.195
that if the folks in the cockpit
need any help, I'm here.

26:10.278 --> 26:12.947
You're in good hands,
but I'll let them know.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.282
Thank you.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.326
What's wrong?

26:16.409 --> 26:18.203
Well, these old planes

26:18.286 --> 26:20.997
were generally at the mercy
of the atmosphere, but...

26:21.081 --> 26:22.457
feels like they're goin'
outta their way

26:22.540 --> 26:23.583
to hit the rough stuff.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.086
Every time we hit a smooth patch
of altitude,

26:26.169 --> 26:27.754
they climb or they dip.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.674
(thunder crashes)

26:30.757 --> 26:32.175
What happens if we get hit?

26:32.258 --> 26:33.885
Well, planes used to get
hit by lightning

26:33.968 --> 26:35.387
more often than you think.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.806
Even old ones like this
were designed to withstand it.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.057
That's not what's worrying me.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.433
(thunder crashing)

26:40.642 --> 26:41.643
PASSENGER: Oh!

26:41.726 --> 26:42.852
(thunder)

26:42.936 --> 26:44.312
(passengers screaming)

26:45.480 --> 26:46.731
(alert chimes)

26:47.023 --> 26:48.983
PILOT: <i>Flight attendants, please</i>
<i>take your seats.</i>

26:49.109 --> 26:50.735
(thunder crashes)

26:54.572 --> 26:55.657
Gordon, what's going on?

26:55.740 --> 26:57.784
-(unbuckling belt)
-I'm going up there.

26:59.828 --> 27:02.247
Excuse me. Hey, you
can't go in there!

27:02.330 --> 27:03.665
Sir, what are you doing?

27:03.832 --> 27:05.625
-Talla, get this door open.
-FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ma'am!

27:05.709 --> 27:07.544
Ma'am, you can't go in there!

27:10.338 --> 27:12.132
(thunder crashing)

27:12.549 --> 27:13.717
Oh, my God.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.844
I need you to take your seats!
Sir? Excuse me!

27:15.927 --> 27:17.929
Are you out of your mind?
There's no one flying the plane!

27:18.013 --> 27:19.764
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: I'm
sorry, but I need all of you to

27:19.848 --> 27:21.850
go back to your seats and fasten
your seat belts right now.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.643
Sir? You need to return
to your seat immediately!

27:23.727 --> 27:25.603
Sir, I need you to g--

27:25.687 --> 27:26.730
(body thuds)

27:28.523 --> 27:29.774
Sorry. It was distracting.

27:29.858 --> 27:30.734
(thunder crashes)

27:30.817 --> 27:32.235
(passengers screaming)

27:37.657 --> 27:39.159
You know how to fly
one of these things?

27:39.242 --> 27:40.660
We're about to find out.

27:42.412 --> 27:43.913
(screaming)

27:53.673 --> 27:56.843
Okay, altimeter, air speed, VSI,
flight director.

27:56.926 --> 27:59.929
-Fuel gauge light's on.
-GORDON MALLOY: Oh, man.

28:00.347 --> 28:01.514
Fuel's low.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.558
-How low?
-Low.

28:08.438 --> 28:11.107
See if you can spot a
patch of open space.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.567
It's all mountains out there.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.778
Better hope not,
'cause if it is, we're dead.

28:14.861 --> 28:17.030
(jet shudders, alarm beeping)

28:17.113 --> 28:18.156
Oh, no.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.116
(engine powering down)

28:20.200 --> 28:21.951
No, no, no, no, no!

28:22.035 --> 28:23.620
-What?
-Engines are out.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.292
(screaming)

28:32.045 --> 28:33.004
There!

28:34.464 --> 28:37.175
Flaps! I'm gonna have
to glide her in!

28:41.388 --> 28:44.683
Come on, baby, come on! Come on!

28:50.397 --> 28:52.232
Grab onto something!

28:59.614 --> 29:01.032
Hang on, this is gonna be rough!

29:37.819 --> 29:39.988
(panting)

29:40.071 --> 29:42.032
(jet creaking)

29:46.870 --> 29:48.163
Come on, let's go!

29:56.504 --> 29:57.714
What the hell?

29:57.797 --> 30:00.008
(clattering, creaking)

30:02.260 --> 30:03.720
(door clangs)

30:16.191 --> 30:17.442
Where are we?

30:22.072 --> 30:23.156
(grunts)

30:26.409 --> 30:28.161
(straining)

30:33.458 --> 30:34.793
Captain. Your head.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.087
(winces)

30:38.380 --> 30:39.631
(sighs) I'll be all right.

30:39.714 --> 30:40.840
Are you sure?

30:40.924 --> 30:43.385
Well, there's not much
I can do about it.

30:43.468 --> 30:46.680
There is an open
chamber, that way.

30:54.813 --> 30:57.148
You know that feeling
you said you had,

30:57.232 --> 30:58.608
when the creature attacked you?

30:58.692 --> 31:00.944
-Yeah.
-I felt it too.

31:01.611 --> 31:04.114
It was right before we crashed.
It was almost like...

31:05.115 --> 31:06.282
like I was somewhere else.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.659
Yes. Exactly.

31:07.742 --> 31:10.495
Like, like your mind
wasn't your own.

31:11.413 --> 31:14.332
I wish Claire were here.
We could both use a brain scan.

31:32.642 --> 31:34.310
What is this place?

31:34.394 --> 31:36.646
It is a Moclan morgue.

31:44.779 --> 31:47.532
Wait, so those...
those pods...

31:47.991 --> 31:50.243
They contain the dead.

31:50.994 --> 31:52.996
MERCER: We never should've
left the ship.

31:53.872 --> 31:56.166
I should've smelled something
was wrong at the start.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.752
Let's look for an exit.

32:03.757 --> 32:06.426
Why do you... hang
them like this?

32:07.552 --> 32:11.431
We honor the dead by raising
them for a period of nine days.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.892
Traditionally, it
is to allow them

32:13.975 --> 32:17.645
to resolve any unfinished
affairs on Moclus

32:17.729 --> 32:19.397
before moving onward.

32:19.481 --> 32:21.066
Oh, that's considerate.

32:33.161 --> 32:34.287
(display whirrs)

32:34.704 --> 32:36.581
(signal chirping)

32:41.753 --> 32:43.672
(metallic clang)

32:49.135 --> 32:51.596
(clang)

32:52.180 --> 32:53.515
Jesus...

32:58.728 --> 32:59.854
Bortus?

33:19.124 --> 33:20.417
BORTUS: Uggh!

33:20.500 --> 33:22.002
(Bortus gasping)

33:32.429 --> 33:33.680
(straining)

33:35.348 --> 33:37.017
Bortus, are you okay?

33:37.559 --> 33:39.352
(panting)

33:41.813 --> 33:43.148
I...

33:43.356 --> 33:44.941
f-felt it.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.276

44:26.833 --> 44:27.959
Look at this.

44:28.043 --> 44:29.586
It's a residual polarization

44:29.669 --> 44:33.298
along the cognitive pathways
of the cerebral cortex, and...

44:33.381 --> 44:35.091
it's present in all five of you.

So, whatever it was, it affected
all of us the same way.

44:37.802 --> 44:40.805
This is evidence of a highly
invasive neurogenic scan.

44:41.222 --> 44:44.059
Think of it as electromagnetic
ayahuasca.

44:44.142 --> 44:46.353

we all just had a bad trip?

44:46.436 --> 44:47.395
Partly.

44:47.645 --> 44:49.606
Doctor, you saw our injuries.

44:49.689 --> 44:51.441
I mean, Gordon got beat
up in a bathroom,

44:51.524 --> 44:53.026
that's not a hallucination.

44:53.109 --> 44:55.987
Bortus, you said
the device's power signature

44:56.071 --> 44:58.239
indicated a holographic
generator.

44:58.323 --> 44:59.949
-That is correct.
-Well,

45:00.158 --> 45:02.577
if you shut off the
safeties in our simulators,

45:02.660 --> 45:03.787
you could be hurt.

45:03.912 --> 45:04.996
Even killed.

45:05.121 --> 45:06.581
Now, I'm just theorizing,

45:06.664 --> 45:08.500
but if this were a technology

45:08.583 --> 45:11.419
that combined neurogenic
and holographic elements,

45:11.503 --> 45:14.214
in effect, they could
split the workload.

45:14.297 --> 45:17.217
The holograms would
outline the environment,

45:17.300 --> 45:19.177
and the neurogenic scan
would prompt the brain

45:19.260 --> 45:20.804
to color it in.
It would explain

45:20.887 --> 45:23.014
how such a small device

45:23.098 --> 45:25.975
was able to create such
vast simulations.

45:26.059 --> 45:28.645
To align and synchronize
such technologies

45:28.728 --> 45:31.523
would require a highly
sophisticated operating system.

45:31.606 --> 45:33.942
Who'd be capable
of that level of technology?

45:34.025 --> 45:36.277
And, why those specific
illusions?

45:36.361 --> 45:37.862
LAMARR: (over comm)

<i>our analysis of the fragments.</i>

45:41.491 --> 45:42.867
<i>I think you better</i>
<i>come to the lab.</i>

45:48.623 --> 45:51.209
ISAAC: <i>There are vestiges</i>
<i>of unfamiliar technology</i>

45:51.292 --> 45:53.378
<i>present within the device's</i>
<i>components,</i>

45:53.461 --> 45:56.756
<i>but the primary elements</i>
<i>appear to be of Kaylon design.</i>

45:56.840 --> 45:58.758
-Oh, man...
-KELLY GRAYSON: Talla.

45:58.842 --> 46:01.177
You said you picked up
Kaylon quantum signatures

46:01.261 --> 46:02.387
on your way back from Xelayah.

46:02.470 --> 46:03.638
I did.

46:03.888 --> 46:06.641
Then it's possible they planted
the device on Narran 1.

46:06.725 --> 46:08.143
For what purpose?

46:08.226 --> 46:09.352
Got me.

46:09.436 --> 46:10.895
So the Kaylon have
figured out a way

46:10.979 --> 46:12.731
to mess with our minds. Great.

46:12.814 --> 46:13.982
KEYALI:
It makes sense.

46:14.190 --> 46:16.568
With the Krill at our side,
they can't outgun us.

46:16.651 --> 46:18.403
But with this, they
may not need to.

46:18.486 --> 46:21.531
If you can control someone's
perception of reality,

46:22.282 --> 46:24.034
peaceful conquest is easy.

of Kaylon activity in the sector

46:33.501 --> 46:35.378

49:24.422 --> 49:26.257
I've been at the rendezvous
point for three hours.

49:26.883 --> 49:28.426
-What?
-KEYALI: <i>Yeah,</i>

49:28.510 --> 49:29.844
I mean, if you
don't want me back,

49:29.928 --> 49:31.262
I'm happy to take
another week off,

49:31.346 --> 49:33.056
but I'd rather get back to work.

49:33.264 --> 49:35.433
Talla, we picked
you up hours ago.

49:35.517 --> 49:36.518
KEYALI: <i>You...</i>

49:36.601 --> 49:37.852
<i>Say again?</i>

49:37.977 --> 49:40.480
We were at the rendezvous
point. We picked you up.

49:40.563 --> 49:42.482
You went down to the
surface of Narran 1

49:42.565 --> 49:45.276
<i>with the Captain, Commander</i>
<i>Grayson, Bortus, and Gordon.</i>

49:45.360 --> 49:46.778
You all disappeared, and
we've been trying

49:46.861 --> 49:47.946
to find you ever since.

49:48.029 --> 49:49.948
John, I left Xelayah
two days ago.

49:50.031 --> 49:51.825
<i>I came straight here.</i>

49:51.908 --> 49:54.244
Look, just meet us in
orbit of Narran 1.

49:54.327 --> 49:55.870
All right, I'll
see you in a bit.

49:55.954 --> 49:57.664
<i>Keyali out.</i>

49:58.081 --> 49:59.249
What the hell is going on?

50:00.625 --> 50:01.960
Isaac. You're still
scanning, right?

50:02.043 --> 50:03.003
ISAAC:
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

50:03.294 --> 50:05.505
<i>Still no indication of</i>
<i>the landing party.</i>

50:07.173 --> 50:08.925
-(crashing)
-Return fire!

50:09.009 --> 50:10.218
Tactical array is down!

50:10.301 --> 50:11.720
Deflectors are failing!

50:25.275 --> 50:27.235
LAMARR: <i>Captain, the quantum</i>
<i>core has been breached!</i>

50:28.486 --> 50:29.904
Deflectors are gone!

50:29.988 --> 50:32.282
So is the navigational array!
I have no helm control!

50:34.451 --> 50:37.912
All hands abandon ship!
Repeat, all hands abandon ship!

50:38.163 --> 50:40.665
(weapons firing)

51:32.926 --> 51:34.135
What's happening?

51:48.149 --> 51:49.275
Who are you?

51:49.859 --> 51:53.863
Don't be afraid, Captain.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.

51:53.947 --> 51:55.657
My name is Dinal.

52:06.501 --> 52:09.254
Are you... responsible
for all this?

52:09.587 --> 52:11.006
Guilty as charged.

52:12.424 --> 52:14.092
You still look unsettled.

52:14.175 --> 52:16.594
It's really okay. You can relax.

52:16.678 --> 52:17.929
Can I offer you some tea?

52:22.058 --> 52:24.477
We'll... pass, thanks.

52:25.145 --> 52:26.396
I understand.

52:26.479 --> 52:28.023
You want to know what's
been happening.

52:28.106 --> 52:29.733
That'd be nice, yeah.

52:37.782 --> 52:39.701
(wind whistling)

52:41.786 --> 52:43.413
We never left the planet.

52:43.663 --> 52:45.999
A point for Gordon!
You are correct.

52:46.082 --> 52:47.876
What have you done
with Lieutenant Keyali?

52:47.959 --> 52:49.753
Oh, she's fine, don't worry.

52:49.836 --> 52:53.631
In fact, she's back aboard your
ship right now, safe and sound.

52:53.715 --> 52:55.967
You still haven't told
us who you are.

52:56.509 --> 52:59.971
You don't know me,
but you knew my ancestors.

53:00.055 --> 53:01.598
Your ancestors...?

53:02.807 --> 53:03.975
Oh, Kelly.

53:04.809 --> 53:06.936
Our goddess, lord, and savior.

53:07.020 --> 53:10.273
Or, more accurately,
a simple human woman

53:10.357 --> 53:13.651
with a less-than-simple
relationship to our forebears.

53:14.944 --> 53:17.322
About two years ago,
by your perception,

53:17.405 --> 53:19.491
you encountered a
planet locked in

53:19.574 --> 53:21.951
what you would call
a "multiphasic" orbit.

53:22.035 --> 53:23.119
GRAYSON:
That's right.

53:23.244 --> 53:24.996
Every 11 days, it would
enter our space,

53:25.080 --> 53:27.290
and during that time,
it advanced 700 years.

53:27.374 --> 53:29.292
And also during that time,

53:29.376 --> 53:31.503
you watched as a religion
sprang up.

53:31.628 --> 53:33.004
A religion devoted
to you,

53:33.254 --> 53:35.507
thanks to your clumsiness
amid one of our...

53:35.590 --> 53:36.800
more primitive eras.

53:38.218 --> 53:39.260
I'm sorry for that.

53:39.344 --> 53:41.221
Ancient history,
it's irrelevant.

53:41.554 --> 53:44.516
Is that why you're here?
To check up on us?

53:44.599 --> 53:47.769
No, no, we've been
watching you for some time.

53:47.852 --> 53:50.689
And don't worry, we're
very discreet.

53:50.772 --> 53:52.357
But, your significance
to our past

53:52.440 --> 53:53.817
made you a logical choice.

53:53.900 --> 53:56.069
Or, at least as good
as any other.

53:56.152 --> 53:58.613
A choice, for what?

53:58.780 --> 54:00.240
By your chronology,

54:00.323 --> 54:03.201
roughly 50,000 years
have passed for us.

54:03.284 --> 54:04.619
I won't bore you with
the details,

54:04.703 --> 54:06.830
but suffice it to say...

54:06.913 --> 54:07.997
we advanced.

54:08.081 --> 54:09.874
You've evolved 50,000 years?

54:09.958 --> 54:13.169
"Evolved" is an arcane term
in this case.

54:13.253 --> 54:15.463
Evolution is blind and drunk.

54:15.547 --> 54:18.466
It stumbles along by
trial and error

54:18.550 --> 54:21.970
and emerges with a barely
adequate excuse for a being.

54:22.053 --> 54:23.013
No offense.

54:23.096 --> 54:24.347
None taken.

54:24.556 --> 54:28.309
Long ago, we learned to take
the reins of evolution,

54:28.393 --> 54:30.145
and guide it with a
greater efficiency.

54:30.603 --> 54:33.606
Let's just say... things
moved faster.

54:34.190 --> 54:35.525
A lot faster.

54:36.985 --> 54:38.611
You're immortal.

54:38.695 --> 54:40.405
Gold star, Captain.

54:40.488 --> 54:43.283
The cultivation of the mind
becomes a lot less stressful

54:43.366 --> 54:45.118
when you don't have to
worry about dying.

54:45.201 --> 54:48.329
None of this explains why you
created these hallucinations.

54:48.413 --> 54:50.707
Oh, everything you experienced
was real.

54:50.790 --> 54:53.251
Think of them as custom-made
micro-universes,

54:53.335 --> 54:54.377
tailored just for you.

54:54.919 --> 54:57.130
The content was gathered
from your own minds,

54:57.213 --> 54:58.631
and cultural databanks.

54:59.007 --> 55:00.633
That's not what mattered.

55:00.717 --> 55:04.429
What did matter is that
each of you experienced a moment

55:04.512 --> 55:06.389
when you thought you
were going to die.

55:06.890 --> 55:08.892
And, we were there
to experience it with you.

55:09.601 --> 55:11.936
I apologize for the brief
disorientation.

55:12.020 --> 55:13.897
That's what happens
when you share a mind.

55:13.980 --> 55:17.776
Why would you wish
to experience death?

55:17.859 --> 55:19.736
Immortality has its rewards.

55:19.819 --> 55:23.114
But after a while, the drive
to advance begins to atrophy.

55:23.198 --> 55:25.700
Once you've seen it
all and done it all,

55:25.784 --> 55:29.037
and time has no worth,
all that's left is...

55:29.120 --> 55:30.622
idle play.

55:31.039 --> 55:32.624
We've become complacent,

55:32.707 --> 55:36.169
because none of us can conceive
of our own mortality.

55:36.252 --> 55:38.338
That's why we had to see it
through your eyes.

55:38.421 --> 55:40.882
Well, I'm glad you got
your existential rocks off,

55:40.965 --> 55:42.801
but the fact is, you
put us through hell.

55:42.884 --> 55:45.011
It was all in the interest
of knowledge.

55:45.095 --> 55:46.971
You poke a worm to
see what it'll do,

55:47.055 --> 55:48.390
you could still kill the worm.

55:48.682 --> 55:50.183
MERCER:
Centuries ago,

55:50.266 --> 55:53.269
my people used other species
for experimentation

55:53.353 --> 55:54.771
in the name of knowledge.

55:54.854 --> 55:58.066
Didn't take us 50,000 years
to realize it was wrong.

55:58.149 --> 55:59.818
You were never in
any real danger.

55:59.901 --> 56:01.403
I promise you that.

56:01.903 --> 56:04.656
What's it like, immortality?

56:04.739 --> 56:08.618
You outgrew your gods
and your nations, as we did.

56:08.702 --> 56:10.120
You left your training
wheels behind

56:10.203 --> 56:11.830
and you made it to the stars.

56:11.996 --> 56:14.457
Your next hurdles are
really no different.

56:14.541 --> 56:17.335
You simply must outgrow self.

56:17.961 --> 56:20.630
These abstractions
that you inhabit for now:

56:21.881 --> 56:26.386
"Captain", "Explorer",
"Husband"...

56:26.886 --> 56:28.138
"Man"...

56:28.680 --> 56:32.350
they are irrelevant when you
become one with the cosmos.

56:32.559 --> 56:34.185
And, when you do...

56:34.853 --> 56:36.146
sculpting a universe

56:36.229 --> 56:39.024
will be as simple
as blinking an eye.

56:40.900 --> 56:43.361
You're an interesting species.

56:44.529 --> 56:45.822
We'll meet again.

56:51.786 --> 56:52.746
(comm beeps)

56:52.829 --> 56:53.913
Mercer to Orville.

56:54.414 --> 56:55.415
Lamarr here, sir!

56:55.498 --> 56:56.416
Are you okay?

56:56.541 --> 56:57.751
MERCER:
<i>We're all right.</i>

56:58.293 --> 56:59.586
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

56:59.669 --> 57:01.504
Sir, what happened?

57:02.005 --> 57:04.674
We... ran into an old friend.

57:05.550 --> 57:06.676
Mercer out.

57:06.760 --> 57:07.886
(comm beeps)

57:07.969 --> 57:09.971
(contemplative music playing)

57:26.654 --> 57:28.198
Well, I'll tell you this:

57:28.281 --> 57:30.909
here's to reality,
with all its troubles.

57:32.369 --> 57:33.953
You know, it's interesting...

57:34.037 --> 57:36.998
as far beyond us as
those people are,

57:37.082 --> 57:39.209
there's one thing we
have in common:

57:39.292 --> 57:41.920
neither of us can fathom
our own mortality.

57:42.003 --> 57:44.089
We all know we're gonna die,

57:44.172 --> 57:47.217
but it's impossible for us
to visualize it.

57:47.300 --> 57:48.677
Oh, I can visualize it.

57:48.760 --> 57:52.097
Yeah. Big funeral, lots
of people weeping,

57:52.180 --> 57:53.390
wishing they'd been nicer to me.

57:53.473 --> 57:55.350
I'm not talking about
your funeral,

57:55.433 --> 57:57.644
I'm talking about
your actual death.

57:57.936 --> 57:59.562
I mean, it's impossible.

57:59.646 --> 58:02.232
I guess it'd be like a...
black emptiness?

58:02.315 --> 58:03.775
MERCER: Yeah, but even in
that scenario,

58:03.858 --> 58:05.985
you're still there,
as an observer,

58:06.069 --> 58:07.445
picturing that void.

58:08.071 --> 58:11.825
Nonexistence is beyond
our capacity to imagine.

58:11.908 --> 58:13.284
The only difference is,

58:13.368 --> 58:15.120
they never have to
worry about it, we do.

58:15.203 --> 58:18.123
Death is an essential
part of life.

58:18.206 --> 58:20.166
It is a noble rite of passage.

58:20.250 --> 58:24.045
Yeah, that's the conventional
philosophical wisdom, but,

58:24.129 --> 58:25.672
it doesn't work for
me, never has.

58:26.423 --> 58:27.841
You'd live forever
if you could?

58:27.924 --> 58:28.800
Yup.

58:28.883 --> 58:30.385
Why?

58:31.469 --> 58:33.138
I want to see what happens.

58:34.097 --> 58:35.223
(slight chuckle)

58:59.956 --> 59:02.959
(thrilling theme playing)

01:00:04.646 --> 01:00:07.565
(fanfare plays)
