WEBVTT

00:18.059 --> 00:20.937
I was born in a
time of dreams.

00:21.312 --> 00:25.108
We were pure of spirit
and devout in our beliefs.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.778
The blessings of Avis
were showered upon us,

00:28.862 --> 00:31.823
and brought our greatest
hopes to life.

00:31.906 --> 00:36.494
But now we face a looming
nightmare.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.749
We brought this nightmare
upon ourselves

00:40.832 --> 00:42.292
when we placed our fate

00:42.375 --> 00:45.086
into the hands of
a false prophet.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.422
(clamoring and jeering)

00:49.090 --> 00:51.343
Supreme Chancellor Korin

00:51.426 --> 00:55.263
has turned his back
on everything we hold sacred.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.015
(jeering)

00:58.600 --> 01:00.435
At this very moment,

01:00.727 --> 01:04.022
he consorts with our enemies
a thousand light-years away,

01:04.105 --> 01:08.610
negotiating a treaty
with the Planetary Union,

01:08.693 --> 01:13.281
a treaty that will imperil
our civilization.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.496
The Chancellor would
have you believe

01:19.579 --> 01:22.207
that this treaty protects us.

01:22.707 --> 01:26.753
But in truth, it weakens us.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.923
It demands we surrender
our divine right

01:30.006 --> 01:32.008
to expand our territory.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.764
It forces us to protect
other worlds

01:37.847 --> 01:39.516
at the risk of our own...

01:42.602 --> 01:44.729
to spill our blood,

01:45.313 --> 01:49.526
to expend our resources
for their benefit!

01:53.697 --> 01:58.910
If this treaty is ratified,
what will they demand next?

02:00.328 --> 02:02.997
More of their ships
in our space?

02:05.083 --> 02:08.420
Their politicians
interfering in our affairs?

02:10.213 --> 02:14.676
The inevitable erosion
of our ideals and our identity?

02:16.511 --> 02:19.889
Where will it end?

02:26.396 --> 02:28.189
When you go home to
your children,

02:28.273 --> 02:31.735
will you tell them you chose
to destroy our future?

02:33.611 --> 02:39.075
Or will you tell them
you have reclaimed our dreams,

02:39.159 --> 02:43.204
and placed your trust
in the word of Avis?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.958
A word which declares...

02:47.042 --> 02:49.419
that Krill comes first!

02:58.303 --> 03:02.515
Place your faith in me
as your Supreme Chancellor,

03:02.599 --> 03:06.102
and I will end this madness!

03:07.270 --> 03:12.776
And those responsible
will pay for their treason!

03:12.859 --> 03:15.487
(crowd jeering)

03:15.570 --> 03:18.114
(chanting "Teleya!")

03:23.036 --> 03:25.121
(dramatic music playing)

03:30.960 --> 03:32.962
(theme song playing)

05:04.763 --> 05:06.723
(orchestra playing show tune)

05:11.144 --> 05:14.731
(singing): <i>♪ The sun will come</i>
<i>out tomorrow ♪</i>

05:14.814 --> 05:19.402
<i>♪ So you gotta hang</i>
<i>on till tomorrow ♪</i>

05:19.486 --> 05:22.697
<i>♪ Come what may ♪</i>

05:22.781 --> 05:25.825
<i>♪ Tomorrow, tomorrow ♪</i>

05:25.909 --> 05:28.703
<i>♪ I love ya tomorrow ♪</i>

05:28.787 --> 05:33.375
<i>♪ You're only a day away ♪</i>

05:33.458 --> 05:37.545
<i>♪ Tomorrow, tomorrow ♪</i>

05:37.629 --> 05:40.340
<i>♪ I love ya tomorrow ♪</i>

05:40.423 --> 05:45.261
<i>♪ You're only a day ♪</i>

05:45.345 --> 05:48.264
<i>♪ A... ♪</i>

05:48.348 --> 05:54.187
<i>♪ Way... ♪</i>

05:57.816 --> 05:59.859
(cheering)

06:18.044 --> 06:21.006
Did you enjoy your evening
on Broadway, Chancellor?

06:21.089 --> 06:25.802
Indeed. However, the repeated
prophecy of the orphan child

06:25.885 --> 06:27.679
was quite haunting.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.183
"The sun will come
out... tomorrow."

06:32.267 --> 06:36.229
In our culture, the sun is a
symbol of suffering and death.

06:36.312 --> 06:40.025
Yes, in retrospect, "Oklahoma!"
might've been a better choice.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.443
The performance
depicted a time

06:41.526 --> 06:43.528
of tremendous hardship
in your history.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.781
For how long did your world
endure this catastrophe?

06:46.865 --> 06:49.826
The Great Depression.
It lasted over a decade.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.287
Sadly, those kinds of
societal collapses

06:52.370 --> 06:53.621
used to be pretty common.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.041
It wasn't until we
advanced beyond the need

06:56.124 --> 06:57.459
to buy and sell things,

06:57.542 --> 06:59.753
that our world became
a more stable place.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.964
The Merchant Class is the
backbone of our civilization.

07:03.048 --> 07:07.260
And our society has been stable
for tens of thousands of years.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.638
What you lack is
divine guidance.

07:10.722 --> 07:11.931
All things considered,

07:12.015 --> 07:14.059
I'd say we're doing pretty
well these days.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.102
And yet, in the face
of the Kaylon threat,

07:16.186 --> 07:18.396
you come to us begging
for salvation.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.773
Pakor!

07:19.898 --> 07:22.692
With all due respect, I wouldn't
exactly call it begging.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.363
There's a clear and obvious
mutual advantage here.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.740
The treaty is not just
for our advantage,

07:28.823 --> 07:30.367
but for yours as well.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.451
The Kaylon threat--

07:31.534 --> 07:33.286
The Kaylon will be defeated.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.747
Our fighting forces
are unequaled.

07:35.830 --> 07:40.293
But... our combined forces
will ensure success.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.380
When the threat is existential,

07:43.463 --> 07:46.466
one cannot afford a
margin for error.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.759
A toast.

07:49.260 --> 07:54.265
To our combined forces and
the salvation of all our worlds.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.605
It's been a pleasure
hosting you, Chancellor.

08:00.689 --> 08:04.401
Perhaps one day a Union
delegation can visit Krill.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.779
We would be most pleased
to return your generosity.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.407
Once the details are finalized,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.617
I propose we sign the treaty

08:12.701 --> 08:16.454
in our glorious capital
city of Dalakos.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.916
And, we will celebrate
my re-instatement

08:20.000 --> 08:21.835
as Supreme Chancellor.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.878
It would be our great honor.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.340
OZAWA: I've... been meaning
to ask about that, if I may.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.552
You seem very certain
of your victory.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.097
My opponent is a
divisive figure

08:34.180 --> 08:36.349
who exploits fear and ignorance.

08:36.933 --> 08:41.312
She has a devout following,
but it is insignificant.

08:41.396 --> 08:45.400
Our projections show that
Chancellor Korin will prevail.

08:45.483 --> 08:49.529
Once the people of Krill see you
for themselves, as I have,

08:49.612 --> 08:54.409
they will understand you are not
the soulless monsters

08:54.701 --> 08:57.704
my opponent would have
them believe.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.166
Well, at the risk of getting us
all drunk on toasts,

09:01.249 --> 09:04.461
here's to your victory,
Chancellor.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.297
And to a new era of
long-lasting peace.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.298
Hear, hear!

09:09.799 --> 09:13.511
(saloon piano playing
"The Yellow Rose of Texas")

09:18.850 --> 09:21.686
Aw, man, y'know, that makes me
miss your moustache.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.855
(laughs) Oh, my God,
you had a moustache?

09:23.938 --> 09:25.440
Oh, yeah, it was amazing.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.692
I thought Moclans
didn't grow facial hair.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.862
Doctor Finn was able
to stimulate growth.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.573
What about the Hippocratic
Oath, "First do no harm"?

09:33.656 --> 09:35.075
Wait a minute, how
is that harm?

09:35.158 --> 09:36.368
It's a moustache.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.162
(chuckles) She's got us there.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.082
Whoa! Commander,
you might wanna pace yourself,

09:42.165 --> 09:43.416
we're only in the 1800s.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.251
Eh, don't worry about
me, I'll make it.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.045
Have you been through
the whole simulation?

09:47.128 --> 09:48.963
Almost. The pub crawl
through history

09:49.047 --> 09:50.465
is a classic in my family.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.926
My dad once made it
from ancient Greece

09:53.009 --> 09:54.469
all the way to the Water Wars.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.595
You know, I gotta say,

09:55.679 --> 09:57.222
I've never understood
the "pub crawl."

09:57.305 --> 09:58.431
We're here, we're drinking.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.683
The booze is gonna be

09:59.766 --> 10:01.142
exactly the same at
the next place.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.770
Let's just stay here,
we're enjoying ourselves.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.607
Hey. Here's to your promotion.
Lieutenant <i>Commander </i>Keyali.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.151
-It's got a nice ring to it.
-Thanks, John.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.570
Best part is, I don't have
to call you "sir" anymore.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.738
That's fine by me.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.240
Kinda like hearing
you use my name.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.200
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.077
Wouldn't mind hearing it
more often, actually.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.246
Are you trying to
tell me something?

10:22.831 --> 10:24.082
Oh, my God.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.753
ISAAC:
<i>This town will not accommodate</i>

10:28.837 --> 10:32.215
<i>the numerical totality</i>
<i>of our combined mass.</i>

10:32.298 --> 10:34.592
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.469
-(comm beeps)
-MAN: <i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

10:36.553 --> 10:37.512
Go ahead.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.097
MAN:
<i>I have Admiral Halsey</i>

10:39.180 --> 10:41.683
<i>on a priority-one channel for</i>
<i>you and Commander Grayson.</i>

10:41.766 --> 10:42.976
We're on our way.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.443
So this is actually happening?
Like it's a done deal?

10:51.526 --> 10:52.986
<i>Everything but the ink.</i>

10:53.153 --> 10:54.529
<i>The last few outstanding points</i>

10:54.612 --> 10:56.239
<i>were finalized</i>
<i>about an hour ago.</i>

10:56.322 --> 10:59.159
Admiral, I gotta say,
congratulations to all of you.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.327
This... This is huge.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.328
<i>Well, you and your crew</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:03.997
<i>should congratulate</i>
<i>yourselves as well.</i>

11:04.080 --> 11:05.623
<i>The Orville played</i>
<i>a critical role</i>

11:05.707 --> 11:07.167
<i>leading up to this achievement.</i>

11:07.250 --> 11:08.501
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

11:08.585 --> 11:09.836
Thank you, sir.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.379
<i>The treaty signing</i>
<i>will take place</i>

11:11.463 --> 11:13.465
<i>in Dalakos in one week.</i>

11:13.548 --> 11:14.841
Dalakos?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.051
On Krill?

11:16.134 --> 11:17.969
<i>President Alcuzan</i>
<i>has been invited,</i>

11:18.053 --> 11:21.014
<i>along with Senator</i>
<i>Balask and myself.</i>

11:21.097 --> 11:24.768
<i>And I've requested The Orville</i>
<i>for transport duty.</i>

11:25.226 --> 11:26.186
Really?

11:26.478 --> 11:28.229
<i>You'll be among the</i>
<i>first Union officers</i>

11:28.313 --> 11:30.106
<i>ever to set foot on Krill.</i>

11:30.190 --> 11:33.443
Sir, this is...
this is amazing.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.861
We're so grateful.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.654
<i>Don't be, you've earned it.</i>

11:36.738 --> 11:38.198
<i>You'll head back to</i>
<i>Earth immediately</i>

11:38.281 --> 11:39.908
<i>to pick up the delegation.</i>

11:39.991 --> 11:42.369
<i>Saddle up, you've</i>
<i>got a long ride.</i>

11:42.619 --> 11:44.287
<i>Halsey out.</i>

11:44.871 --> 11:47.499
-Oh, my God.
-This is unbelievable.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.584
You know what the
best part is?

11:49.668 --> 11:50.543
What?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.253
He had no idea we'd
been drinking.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.006
-This is a good day.
-It is a good day.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.424
(chuckles)

11:56.508 --> 11:58.385
(tranquil music playing)

12:19.280 --> 12:21.032
(hatch whirring)

12:27.038 --> 12:28.790
Ah! Captain Mercer.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.208
So good to finally
meet you.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.836
The privilege
is all mine, Mr. President.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.464
(chuckles) And you must be
Commander Grayson.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.134
I've heard great things
from Admiral Halsey.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.302
We both admired your
father very much.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.680
Thank you, Mr. President.
I know he felt the same.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.725
Well, I appreciate
the honor guard,

12:46.808 --> 12:48.518
but, uh, you didn't have to go
to the trouble.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.186
It's no trouble, sir.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.981
This is my Chief of Security,
Commander Talla Keyali.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.733
Your team is impressive,
Commander.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.276
Thank you, sir.
It's not every day

12:56.359 --> 12:58.028
I get to show them off
for a group like this.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.905
If you're ready to get settled,
we'll show you to your quarters.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.240
Ah, wonderful.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.201
Ed.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.453
Before we get underway,

13:06.536 --> 13:08.204
there's something
you should know...

13:08.455 --> 13:09.456
about the election.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.416
What is it?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.752
<i>What they call a treaty,</i>

13:13.835 --> 13:17.088
<i>I call a capitulation</i>
<i>of cowards!</i>

13:17.172 --> 13:19.257
(jeering)

13:22.052 --> 13:24.804
<i>Their Union is a patchwork</i>
<i>alliance</i>

13:24.888 --> 13:26.639
<i>of hundreds of species,</i>

13:26.723 --> 13:30.727
<i>that long ago surrendered</i>
<i>their identities to this...</i>

13:30.810 --> 13:34.814
<i>this social collective that</i>
<i>rapes them of their purity.</i>

13:34.898 --> 13:37.484
(crowd jeering)

13:37.567 --> 13:39.903
<i>Would you let them</i>
<i>do the same to us?</i>

13:39.986 --> 13:42.197
ALL: (jeering) <i>No!</i>

13:42.280 --> 13:44.491
<i>Make no mistake.</i>

13:44.699 --> 13:47.452
<i>The outstretched hand</i>
<i>of welcome</i>

13:47.535 --> 13:50.830
<i>will quickly become</i>
<i>the fist of oppression.</i>

13:50.914 --> 13:51.831
(jeering)

13:51.915 --> 13:54.125
<i>We must kill this treaty,</i>

13:54.209 --> 13:57.045
<i>and reclaim our rightful place</i>

13:57.128 --> 14:00.507
<i>as the dominant force</i>
<i>in this galaxy.</i>

14:00.590 --> 14:02.300
(crowd chanting "Teleya!")

14:05.345 --> 14:06.721
(screen chimes)

14:08.515 --> 14:10.392
After you released
Teleya to the Krill,

14:10.475 --> 14:12.060
she quit the military.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.853
Several months later,
she reemerged

14:13.937 --> 14:16.231
as part of a small but
vocal opposition

14:16.314 --> 14:17.440
to the Krill establishment.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.485
It didn't really gain traction
until the Krill started talking

14:20.568 --> 14:21.945
about a treaty with the Union.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.489
That's when Teleya's rhetoric
started to resonate.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.991
More and more people
began to take her seriously.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.660
Her personal story,

14:28.743 --> 14:31.496
the so-called massacre
of her brother and crew,

14:31.579 --> 14:34.749
helped her reinvent herself
as a sort of folk hero.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.501
She's been gaining popularity
ever since.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.336
Does she have a chance
in the election?

14:38.420 --> 14:40.505
It's our understanding
that Chancellor Korin

14:40.588 --> 14:41.715
maintains a wide lead.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.508
But for some, his embrace
of the treaty

14:43.591 --> 14:44.592
makes him look soft.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.344
To the more radical
demographics,

14:46.428 --> 14:48.596
his comparatively moderate
administration

14:48.680 --> 14:50.140
seems out of touch.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.268
So, what you've got
is a political vacuum.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.562
A political vacuum is
a dangerous thing.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.646
Always.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.981
If no one fills it with hope,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.441
someone will fill it with fear.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.068
Regardless of the outcome,
we have to assume Teleya

15:02.152 --> 15:05.071
will do everything in her power
to undermine the alliance.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.282
I thought we'd
made progress.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.868
Ed, you know her better
than any of us.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.454
If there are any insights
you could provide

15:12.537 --> 15:15.165
as far as her thinking,
her vulnerabilities,

15:15.248 --> 15:17.250
it would be very helpful.

15:24.841 --> 15:25.717
(sighs)

15:26.384 --> 15:27.886
<i>I promise you,</i>

15:27.969 --> 15:31.181
<i>you will achieve nothing</i>
<i>by this demonstration.</i>

15:31.264 --> 15:32.515
(jeering)

15:33.725 --> 15:36.227
<i>There will be no additional</i>
<i>funding</i>

15:36.311 --> 15:37.854
<i>for the Uvok Province!</i>

15:37.937 --> 15:39.439
(door chirps)

15:41.274 --> 15:42.192
Come in.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.655
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.409
I was just checking to see
how you're holding up.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.829
I owe you an apology.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.498
For what?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.793
You objected to my
releasing Teleya,

15:59.876 --> 16:02.545
and I ignored you.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.133
I just...

16:07.842 --> 16:11.513
wanted to believe that I had
reached her on some level.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.182
You can't blame yourself
for what Teleya believes.

16:15.934 --> 16:16.810
(sighs)

16:17.560 --> 16:18.561
Look at this.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.025
Chancellor Korin gave
us limited access

16:24.109 --> 16:26.319
to the Krill informational
network.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.320
(crowd jeering)

16:27.529 --> 16:29.239
<i>The people of the</i>
<i>Uvok Province</i>

16:29.322 --> 16:31.282
<i>have repeatedly</i>
<i>shown themselves</i>

16:31.366 --> 16:35.912
<i>to be blasphemous degenerates,</i>
<i>unworthy of our aid!</i>

16:35.995 --> 16:38.373
<i>By assembling in this place,</i>

16:38.456 --> 16:43.294
<i>you show yourselves</i>
<i>to be as disloyal as they are!</i>

16:43.378 --> 16:47.549
<i>You will regret what</i>
<i>you do here today!</i>

16:47.632 --> 16:48.925
(computer chirps)

16:49.009 --> 16:50.427
A few minutes after this,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.971
the protestors were gassed
with helocine.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.556
Eleven people died.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.099
My God.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.809
This is the guy
we want to sign a treaty with?

16:57.892 --> 17:00.687
You know what the real problem
with this event is?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.188
It never happened.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.442
It's completely fictitious.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.819
And there are countless
other files

17:07.902 --> 17:09.529
that show all kinds of scenarios

17:09.612 --> 17:11.573
where Chancellor Korin
oppresses his people.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.658
There are even some
from the other side

17:13.742 --> 17:15.160
designed to discredit Teleya,

17:15.243 --> 17:16.494
although they're not
that different

17:16.578 --> 17:17.704
from her actual speeches.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.205
How can you tell
the difference?

17:19.289 --> 17:20.874
Sometimes I can't.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.001
I asked the Chancellor,
and he said

17:23.084 --> 17:25.086
they call it "influence
operations."

17:25.170 --> 17:26.713
They have computers

17:26.796 --> 17:29.382
generating thousands
of these things every second,

17:29.466 --> 17:31.009
trying to stoke outrage.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.927
Even the angry crowds are phony.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.680
What do you make of it?
As far as the election goes?

17:35.764 --> 17:37.182
I don't know.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.019
Teleya is inexperienced.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.813
She's a populist,
not a politician.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.232
She's running on rhetoric
and fire.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.402
So, the Chancellor
thinks that he's still a lock.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.945
He says he trusts
his people

17:51.029 --> 17:52.572
to follow the will of Avis.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.533
You never want
to underestimate

17:55.617 --> 17:56.951
a populist movement.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.372
Emotions can be
more persuasive than thoughts.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.539
(sighs)

18:02.499 --> 18:04.501
You think any of this will
affect the treaty?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.670
Well, battle plans are
only perfect

18:06.753 --> 18:08.380
until the fighting starts.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.548
I gotta believe that

18:10.632 --> 18:14.177
some version of that
holds true for peace treaties.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.690
(intense music playing)

18:30.652 --> 18:32.153
We're approaching Krill
space, Captain.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.530
Drop to sublight.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.864
Aye, sir.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.624
Three Krill battlecruisers
are closing on our position.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.222
They're signaling
us to follow them.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.306
Gordon.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.225
Matching speed and heading.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.988
ISAAC:
<i>The planet is enveloped</i>

19:15.071 --> 19:17.782
<i>by cirrostratus</i>
<i>and cumulonimbus cloud layers.</i>

19:17.866 --> 19:20.994
<i>Average surface temperature</i>
<i>is five degrees above freezing.</i>

19:21.077 --> 19:23.288
SENATOR BALASK: That's going to
be a bumpy entry.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.290
Your navigator will
have to be alert.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.042
I think you'll find
Ensign Burke

19:27.125 --> 19:29.044
is pretty quick on the draw.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.546
I promise I'll get you there
in one piece, Senator.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.882
Captain, the shuttle has been
cleared for departure.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.302
We'll see you soon.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.928
Go make some history.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.001
Approaching ionosphere.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.169
Sir, I'm gonna be feeding you

20:11.252 --> 20:12.545
the course corrections
pretty quickly.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.339
This atmosphere is gonna kick
our butts a little,

20:14.422 --> 20:16.257
but I'll try to keep us
out of the roughest air.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.717
Very good, Ensign.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.303
Sir, I'm happy to take the helm
if you want.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.972
You're asking if I'm
as sharp as I used to be?

20:23.056 --> 20:25.266
No, sir, not at all.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.688
When I called you from Earth,
I knew you and Kelly were drunk.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.358
Point made, sir.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.818
Shuttle's yours.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.403
Brace for entry.

20:44.369 --> 20:48.206
"Night falls fast,
today is in the past."

20:48.832 --> 20:50.125
What is that, sir?

20:50.625 --> 20:52.085
It's from a poem.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.838
Okay, here we go.
It's about to get bumpy, folks.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.798
How dense is the
full cloud cover?

20:56.881 --> 20:58.383
About 80 kilometers.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.350
We've lost sight of our escorts.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.145
I have 'em on lateral scans.
They're on us like glue.

21:14.941 --> 21:15.942
Look...

21:17.068 --> 21:19.946
(dramatic music playing)

22:19.214 --> 22:20.674
All right, this is it.

22:20.757 --> 22:21.758
We'll see you soon.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.593
Yes, sir. I'll be here.

22:24.302 --> 22:27.806
You know, Ensign...
this is history in the making.

22:27.889 --> 22:30.350
Perhaps you'd like to join us
as an observer.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.602
If your Captain has
no objections.

22:32.686 --> 22:33.937
None, Admiral.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.272
Very well. Come on.

23:04.843 --> 23:06.219
Who's this guy?

23:06.302 --> 23:09.347
That's Avis, the Krill deity.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.517
Looks like a lotta laughs.

23:30.535 --> 23:33.038
President Alcuzan. Welcome.

23:33.121 --> 23:35.957
This is truly an historic
occasion.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.501
Your gracious invitation
honors us, Chancellor.

23:38.585 --> 23:42.339
Please, join us for
some Kahspid cider.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.673
A Krill delicacy.

23:43.757 --> 23:45.091
Alien delicacies.

23:45.175 --> 23:46.718
Always a crap shoot.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.098
-Wow!
-Mm. That's fantastic.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.933
My God, could we get
a case of this?

23:54.017 --> 23:57.604
We take great pride
in our Kahspid crops.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.689
I will have some sent
to your ship.

23:59.773 --> 24:01.191
Your timing is excellent.

24:01.274 --> 24:03.610
Several districts have
yet to be counted,

24:03.693 --> 24:05.653
but we remain confident.

24:05.737 --> 24:09.282
Tonight, we will all have reason
to celebrate.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.700
Come, please.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.457
What is your opinion
of our city, Ensign?

24:17.540 --> 24:18.833
It's amazing.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.044
The view was incredible
from the shuttle.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.213
I hope we get to see more of it.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.848
If I may propose a toast,
Chancellor...

24:33.932 --> 24:35.016
To the treaty.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.559
And, to the future.

24:36.643 --> 24:37.644
(glasses clink)

24:42.482 --> 24:44.234
What's that cluster of lights?

24:44.317 --> 24:47.946
The Grand Marketplace,
our center of commerce.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.281
Merchants from every
corner of the planet

24:50.365 --> 24:51.408
can be found there.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.744
Chancellor, I am sorry
to interrupt,

24:54.828 --> 24:57.580
but the final districts
are reporting their outcomes.

24:57.664 --> 24:58.873
And?

24:58.957 --> 25:01.459
The situation has changed.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.380
(overlapping voices on screens)

25:09.342 --> 25:10.760
What's going on?

25:10.844 --> 25:14.139
Teleya. She has prevailed
in the last seven districts.

25:14.681 --> 25:15.974
But you're still ahead, right?

25:21.563 --> 25:22.772
What's happening?

25:22.856 --> 25:25.358
The final districts
are being counted now.

25:25.442 --> 25:28.903
The Chancellor is winning,
but only by a small margin.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.034
No.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.036
This is...

25:36.119 --> 25:37.162
not possible.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.414
We have lost the
Katal District.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.458
And the Garathon is
turning as well.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.376
Chancellor,
we cannot win without them!

25:43.460 --> 25:44.586
(screen chirps)

25:44.669 --> 25:46.588
<i>Several districts</i>
<i>have yet to report,</i>

25:46.671 --> 25:49.341
<i>but they will have no bearing</i>
<i>on the final outcome.</i>

25:49.424 --> 25:52.052
<i>The Circle of Clerics</i>
<i>have conferred,</i>

25:52.135 --> 25:54.971
<i>and they are prepared</i>
<i>to sanctify Teleya</i>

25:55.055 --> 25:58.016
<i>as the Supreme Chancellor</i>
<i>of Krill.</i>

25:59.809 --> 26:02.270
<i>When sanctification</i>
<i>is ratified,</i>

26:02.354 --> 26:04.731
<i>the anointing ceremony</i>
<i>will commence,</i>

26:04.814 --> 26:05.982
<i>and all citizens--</i>

26:06.066 --> 26:08.234
Notify the Circle of Clerics

26:08.318 --> 26:11.404
that they must suspend
their judgment immediately.

26:11.488 --> 26:13.490
We intend to challenge
this result.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.325
They are unlikely
to reconsider.

26:15.408 --> 26:18.203
They will do as I say

26:18.286 --> 26:21.373
as long as I am still
Supreme Chancellor.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.627
Clearly, our projections
were flawed.

26:25.710 --> 26:28.463
But close elections
are not unprecedented.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.715
When the margin of victory
is this narrow,

26:30.799 --> 26:33.093
a challenge is always honored.

26:33.176 --> 26:34.803
And I am certain that once--

26:36.971 --> 26:37.972
Korin!

26:39.015 --> 26:40.600
You will come with us.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.644
What is the meaning of this?!

26:42.727 --> 26:44.562
We have orders
for your arrest.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.940
Arrest? For what?

26:47.023 --> 26:48.191
Treason.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.984
Whose orders?

26:50.068 --> 26:52.112
Supreme Chancellor Teleya.

26:52.821 --> 26:55.448
You will come with us. Now.

26:56.324 --> 26:58.785
This is heresy!
Teleya has not sworn her oath!

26:58.868 --> 27:02.288
She has no authority!
I am Supreme Chancellor!

27:02.372 --> 27:04.833
This is not an election,
it is a coup!

27:04.916 --> 27:06.876
Pakor, contact the
Circle of Clerics!

27:06.960 --> 27:09.754
Our fate belongs to Avis now.

27:09.838 --> 27:12.882
(groaning) Let me go, you fools!
The people have...

27:12.966 --> 27:16.636
We are observers here.
You have no right to detain us.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.638
-Mr. President!
-Sir, are you all right?

27:18.722 --> 27:19.723
Help him!

27:20.140 --> 27:21.266
Take them.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.614
Commander. One of
the Krill vessels

27:36.698 --> 27:39.034
is locking onto us with
a tractor beam.

27:42.912 --> 27:45.040
-Hail them.
-They're already hailing us.

27:45.123 --> 27:46.124
Put them through.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.711
This is Commander Kelly Grayson.
What the hell are you doing?

27:49.794 --> 27:51.880
<i>The treaty has been nullified.</i>

27:51.963 --> 27:54.883
<i>Supreme Chancellor Teleya has</i>
<i>called for your imprisonment.</i>

27:54.966 --> 27:56.301
I'm sorry, what?

27:56.384 --> 27:58.762
<i>Surrender your vessel</i>
<i>and prepare to be boarded.</i>

27:58.845 --> 28:00.555
Contact the landing party.

28:00.638 --> 28:02.057
I'm trying. No response.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.059
I demand to speak with
Captain Mercer.

28:04.142 --> 28:07.312
<i>Surrender now.</i>
<i>You will not be warned again.</i>

28:08.229 --> 28:10.231
-Any word?
-Nothing.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.526
Bortus, I want you to lock onto
their tractor emitters.

28:13.610 --> 28:16.404
-Stand by to fire on my command.
-Aye, sir.

28:16.905 --> 28:19.115
-Bridge to Engineering.
-Lamarr here.

28:19.199 --> 28:22.160
KELLY GRAYSON:
<i>John, execute Directive 21.</i>

28:22.243 --> 28:24.788
Sir, please confirm.
Did you say 21?

28:24.871 --> 28:26.331
GRAYSON:
<i>Yes. Have Dr. Finn assist you.</i>

28:26.414 --> 28:27.415
Do it now.

28:27.499 --> 28:28.917
Understood.

28:30.752 --> 28:31.836
Go to red alert.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.715
Targeting scanners are locked.
Weapons standing by.

28:35.799 --> 28:38.426
-Gordon, get ready to haul ass.
-You got it.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.553
ISAAC: <i>They have activated their</i>
<i>docking clamps.</i>

28:40.637 --> 28:41.554
Fire.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.682
(lasers firing)

28:44.516 --> 28:46.226
-We're clear!
-GRAYSON: Evasive maneuvers!

28:46.309 --> 28:47.560
Full power to the deflectors!

28:52.315 --> 28:53.775
Hard about, return fire!

29:06.871 --> 29:09.874
Port deflectors are failing!
Torpedo launchers are off-line!

29:09.958 --> 29:11.334
John, what's your status?

29:11.418 --> 29:13.044
JOHN LAMARR:
<i>Almost ready, Commander!</i>

29:14.129 --> 29:15.964
-How close is "almost"?
-LAMARR: <i>Two minutes!</i>

29:16.047 --> 29:17.674
I can't shake 'em!

29:21.386 --> 29:23.888
Sir, what if we tried
an expanding helix maneuver?

29:23.972 --> 29:25.056
Never heard of it.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.307
That's because I
just made it up.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.768
-Do it.
-(ship rumbles)

29:40.947 --> 29:42.407
Krill fighters in pursuit.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.459
John, we're about to lose
deflectors. It's now or never.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.294
LAMARR: <i>Directive 21</i>
<i>clear, Commander.</i>

29:54.377 --> 29:55.670
Gordon, take us to quantum.

30:01.676 --> 30:05.096
(crowd roaring)

30:05.180 --> 30:07.640
(chanting "Teleya!")

30:15.899 --> 30:18.651
-Hail Avis!
-Hail Teleya!

30:18.735 --> 30:20.570
(shouting continues)

30:31.331 --> 30:35.168
The Anhkana teaches us
that a battle is not won

30:35.251 --> 30:38.171
until the last enemy
is vanquished.

30:38.254 --> 30:41.549
We have achieved a great
victory today,

30:42.592 --> 30:45.387
but an enemy remains
in our midst.

30:45.470 --> 30:49.641
(crowd roaring, jeering)

30:55.730 --> 30:58.858
Look into the eyes
of the people you have betrayed!

31:03.029 --> 31:05.115
You are a traitor to your world,

31:05.198 --> 31:07.534
and a heretic in the
eyes of Avis.

31:09.077 --> 31:11.705
Do you wish to beg for mercy?

31:13.206 --> 31:15.417
(speaking Krill)

31:22.340 --> 31:25.301
Then it is my duty as
Supreme Chancellor

31:25.385 --> 31:28.430
to see that justice is done.

31:28.513 --> 31:30.807
(jeering)

31:35.979 --> 31:37.480
(grunts)

31:37.564 --> 31:39.566
(crowd whooping and jeering)

31:45.989 --> 31:50.076
(crowd chanting "Teleya!")

31:53.872 --> 31:56.541
He is not the last
of our enemies.

31:57.167 --> 32:00.170
I have learned that the
President of the Planetary Union

32:00.253 --> 32:02.881
and his delegation have
been apprehended.

32:02.964 --> 32:06.676
-(cheering)
-They too shall face justice!

32:06.760 --> 32:08.345
(crowd roaring)

32:18.521 --> 32:21.191
We need to speak
with Chancellor Teleya.

32:21.274 --> 32:23.109
Or whoever the hell
is in charge.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.987
You can't just hold us
here indefinitely.

32:26.071 --> 32:28.698
At least let us contact
The Orville.

32:29.574 --> 32:32.660
You've got the President
of the Planetary Union in here.

32:32.744 --> 32:35.663
Do you want to be held
responsible for starting a war?

32:36.289 --> 32:37.832
How about a cup of coffee?

32:38.541 --> 32:41.586
Commander Grayson must be aware
of our situation by now.

32:41.670 --> 32:42.921
She'll contact the Union.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.173
Assuming The Orville
hasn't been captured.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.843
I'm sorry, Ensign, we never
should've brought you along.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.387
Captain, there's no
way this doesn't mean

32:50.470 --> 32:52.806
a declaration of
war with the Krill. Right?

32:53.181 --> 32:55.642
They've abducted the President.
There's your answer.

32:55.725 --> 32:57.936
If there's a drawn-out conflict,
it'll weaken our resources.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.647
We can bet the Kaylon will seize
the opportunity to attack.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.440
What then?

33:02.524 --> 33:05.110
We'll find ourselves fighting
a two-front war.

33:06.194 --> 33:07.320
Of course, so will the Krill.

33:07.404 --> 33:08.947
We need each other,

33:09.114 --> 33:10.490
whether they understand
it or not.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.117
We have to get them to see that.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.035
It's too late.

33:16.246 --> 33:17.539
(door opens)

33:18.456 --> 33:19.541
Captain Mercer.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.336
You will come with us.

33:23.545 --> 33:24.713
What about them?

33:24.796 --> 33:26.047
Just you.

33:27.549 --> 33:28.591
Go with them.

33:28.675 --> 33:30.135
We can't do anything
from in here.

34:07.756 --> 34:08.882
You may go.

34:18.475 --> 34:19.893
So silent.

34:20.852 --> 34:22.854
Nothing to say, Captain?

34:23.313 --> 34:25.523
Looks like you're
an uptown girl now.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.526
Billy Joel.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.658
(deep breath) I guess...

34:35.742 --> 34:37.744
congratulations are in order.

34:38.328 --> 34:39.454
Thank you.

34:40.997 --> 34:43.416
Captivity notwithstanding...

34:43.750 --> 34:45.919
it's nice to see your face.

34:46.002 --> 34:48.046
You should feel validated.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.965
Your faith in me
has made this victory possible.

34:51.216 --> 34:52.384
How so?

34:52.467 --> 34:54.302
If you had not released me,

34:54.386 --> 34:56.638
I would still be in
Union custody.

34:56.721 --> 34:58.682
I let you go

34:58.765 --> 35:01.226
because I believed
we'd found some common ground,

35:01.309 --> 35:04.062
not so you could drive a deeper
wedge between our two peoples.

35:04.145 --> 35:06.314
There was never
a common ground.

35:06.940 --> 35:10.235
You were merely too stupid
to resist a false seduction.

35:10.318 --> 35:11.861
Yeah. Well, movie night was fun,

35:11.945 --> 35:13.780
but that's not what
I'm talking about.

35:14.531 --> 35:18.159
Teleya, we share a common enemy.

35:18.243 --> 35:19.953
And my ensign is right:

35:20.036 --> 35:22.539
if the Kaylon attack us again,
we're gonna need each other.

35:22.622 --> 35:26.876
Our military has developed
new and more powerful weapons.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.254
Our fleet is stronger
than ever before.

35:30.588 --> 35:33.258
An alliance with outsiders
is no longer necessary.

35:33.341 --> 35:35.593
Well, about half your population
disagrees.

35:35.677 --> 35:37.053
Korin had a lot of support.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.848
Korin's influence
has diminished considerably.

35:40.432 --> 35:42.142
Ask him yourself if
you would like.

35:42.225 --> 35:45.270
You will find him in the center
of the Capitol Square.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.397
Or, at least his head.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.691
You killed him.

35:49.774 --> 35:53.028
Most men who lose their heads
tend to die, yes.

35:53.111 --> 35:54.779
How could you do that?

35:55.697 --> 35:57.198
Teleya, that's not who you are.

35:57.282 --> 36:00.702
A year later, you still cling
to an illusion I created.

36:00.785 --> 36:03.329
Captain, you really must
find yourself a...

36:04.205 --> 36:05.957
what is your word for it?

36:06.041 --> 36:06.958
A girlfriend.

36:07.042 --> 36:08.043
You murdered a man.

36:08.126 --> 36:10.628
I purified the soul
of our world.

36:10.712 --> 36:12.922
Well, if that's the
way you see it...

36:14.299 --> 36:15.800
then I guess you're right.

36:16.468 --> 36:17.719
I was too stupid.

36:17.802 --> 36:20.972
Praise Avis,
his eyes are finally open.

36:21.056 --> 36:22.724
So, is that why you
brought me here?

36:24.059 --> 36:26.811
To remind me what
an idiot I was?

36:27.395 --> 36:29.856
I brought you here
to see for myself.

36:31.024 --> 36:32.442
To be sure it was really you.

36:32.525 --> 36:33.568
Why?

36:34.736 --> 36:37.989
I promised my people the blood
of the Union contingent.

36:40.367 --> 36:41.618
What are you saying?

36:41.743 --> 36:42.744
You and your colleagues

36:42.827 --> 36:45.080
are to be executed
in the morning.

36:46.081 --> 36:47.957
So, you want me dead too?

36:48.917 --> 36:51.169
I did not know you were part
of the delegation.

36:52.003 --> 36:55.298
Teleya. I let you go.

36:55.382 --> 36:57.926
I'm asking you to do
the same for us.

36:58.009 --> 36:59.344
Now, you may not want a treaty,

36:59.427 --> 37:01.763
but do you really want to start
a war with the Union?

37:04.432 --> 37:07.185
Take a look around
you, Captain.

37:07.268 --> 37:09.521
I now command the full
might of Krill.

37:10.146 --> 37:13.233
It is you who should
be asking yourself,

37:13.316 --> 37:15.985
is the Union prepared
for war with us?

37:18.822 --> 37:23.868
There's an old Earth verse
that describes a traveler,

37:23.952 --> 37:27.330
who comes upon the ancient
ruined statue of an Emperor,

37:27.414 --> 37:29.040
inscribed with the words,

37:29.124 --> 37:32.252
"My name is Ozymandias,
king of kings.

37:32.335 --> 37:35.714
Look upon my works, ye mighty,
and despair!"

37:37.507 --> 37:39.551
Only there's nothing
left beside it

37:39.634 --> 37:41.678
except empty desert.

37:43.388 --> 37:46.307
Hubris has a way of coming back
to bite you in the ass.

37:46.891 --> 37:50.145
Our time in this
realm is finite, Captain,

37:50.228 --> 37:51.938
as you will soon learn.

37:52.564 --> 37:55.233
One can live it in a
light of command,

37:55.316 --> 37:57.777
or in a darkness of servitude.

37:59.070 --> 38:01.823
I choose the way of Ozymandias.

38:03.491 --> 38:04.534
Cha-FAJ!

38:06.536 --> 38:08.329
Take him back to his cell.

38:08.413 --> 38:10.832
The execution will proceed
as planned.

38:10.915 --> 38:11.833
Teleya, listen to me!

38:11.916 --> 38:12.917
-You can't--
-Goodbye, Ed.

38:13.585 --> 38:16.379
I am glad we had the chance
to talk one last time.

38:17.172 --> 38:20.091
What do you call it? Closure?

38:23.470 --> 38:25.221
(door whirring open)

38:41.321 --> 38:42.781
Put this on.

38:43.656 --> 38:47.869
-What for?
-Do as you are told.

38:55.877 --> 38:56.795
Move.

39:00.507 --> 39:02.384
(dramatic music playing)

39:05.178 --> 39:07.180
Commander, I'm getting
a response to our hails.

39:07.263 --> 39:09.224
About time. Put it through.

39:10.392 --> 39:12.185
<i>Hello, Commander Grayson.</i>

39:13.353 --> 39:14.396
Teleya...

39:14.688 --> 39:17.524
<i>I apologize for the delay</i>
<i>in contacting you.</i>

39:17.607 --> 39:20.151
<i>As you can imagine,</i>
<i>I have been quite busy.</i>

39:20.235 --> 39:21.444
Where are my people?

39:21.528 --> 39:22.821
<i>Your people?</i>

39:22.904 --> 39:25.699
<i>They are my people</i>
<i>now, Commander,</i>

39:25.782 --> 39:27.534
<i>prisoners charged</i>
<i>with conspiracy</i>

39:27.617 --> 39:29.703
<i>to subvert the government</i>
<i>of Krill.</i>

39:29.786 --> 39:31.454
We both know that's a lie.

39:31.538 --> 39:33.998
Let them go before you make
a bad situation worse.

39:34.082 --> 39:37.085
<i>Or what?</i>
<i>You will take them by force?</i>

39:37.168 --> 39:38.878
<i>That would end badly for you.</i>

39:38.962 --> 39:41.423
<i>Return to Earth while</i>
<i>you still can.</i>

39:41.506 --> 39:44.092
You know goddamn well I'm not
leaving without that delegation!

39:44.175 --> 39:46.845
<i>You are becoming emotional,</i>
<i>Commander.</i>

39:46.928 --> 39:49.305
<i>But then that was always</i>
<i>the concern, was it not?</i>

39:49.389 --> 39:51.516
<i>That your feelings for Ed</i>
<i>would impair</i>

39:51.599 --> 39:54.269
<i>your ability to make</i>
<i>the proper command decisions?</i>

39:54.352 --> 39:56.271
And what would you
know about that?

39:56.354 --> 39:58.064
TELEYA:
<i>More than you realize.</i>

39:58.148 --> 40:00.442
<i>He told me many things</i>
<i>about you.</i>

40:00.525 --> 40:02.736
Then you also know
I don't back down from a fight.

40:02.819 --> 40:05.530
TELEYA:
<i>Ed is gone, Commander.</i>

40:05.613 --> 40:07.532
<i>Perhaps you should do what</i>
<i>you have done before</i>

40:07.615 --> 40:09.117
<i>when this happens:</i>

40:09.200 --> 40:11.036
<i>run to the arms of another.</i>

40:11.911 --> 40:13.329
<i>Leave. Now.</i>

40:13.580 --> 40:15.498
<i>And if you re-enter our space,</i>

40:15.582 --> 40:19.878
<i>I promise you will never</i>
<i>see home again.</i>

40:21.046 --> 40:23.089
Gordon.
Back us off toward the border.

40:23.798 --> 40:25.425
-But, Commander--
-Do it.

40:26.968 --> 40:27.969
Aye, sir.

40:28.053 --> 40:30.263
Talla. Get me Union Central.

40:35.518 --> 40:37.145
<i>We've got the fleet</i>
<i>on high alert,</i>

40:37.228 --> 40:39.105
<i>and we're sending every</i>
<i>available ship.</i>

40:39.189 --> 40:42.692
Sir, has the Union acknowledged
a formal state of war?

40:42.776 --> 40:44.277
<i>Yes, it has.</i>

40:44.361 --> 40:47.113
<i>Commander, what's the status</i>
<i>of Directive 21?</i>

40:47.197 --> 40:49.574
Still in progress, sir.
It's gonna need more time.

40:49.657 --> 40:51.242
I wouldn't put all
our chips on it.

40:51.326 --> 40:54.621
<i>Then our best option right now</i>
<i>is to mount a military rescue,</i>

40:54.704 --> 40:56.164
<i>extract the delegation,</i>

40:56.247 --> 40:57.874
<i>and withdraw as</i>
<i>quickly as possible.</i>

40:57.957 --> 40:59.584
How soon can help get here?

40:59.668 --> 41:01.211
<i>The first contingent of ships</i>

41:01.294 --> 41:03.797
<i>should arrive at the Krill</i>
<i>border in under two hours.</i>

41:03.880 --> 41:06.716
<i>I know we were all counting</i>
<i>on this treaty.</i>

41:06.800 --> 41:08.468
<i>But for now, let's</i>
<i>just stay focused</i>

41:08.551 --> 41:10.053
<i>on getting our people home.</i>

41:10.136 --> 41:11.554
<i>Perry out.</i>

41:16.643 --> 41:19.396
(crowd clamoring)

41:25.568 --> 41:27.570
(dramatic music playing)

41:34.327 --> 41:35.662
Where are we going?

41:46.214 --> 41:48.216
(dramatic music rising)

42:01.062 --> 42:02.981
(locals speaking Krill)

42:12.240 --> 42:15.118
(sensual music playing)

42:17.412 --> 42:19.581
(women moaning)

42:20.874 --> 42:23.752
-(speaking Krill)
-Move.

42:23.835 --> 42:26.171
<i>Do'maflach! Do'maflach!</i>

42:27.130 --> 42:28.506
<i>Do'maflach!</i>

42:30.258 --> 42:32.510
<i>-Do'maflach!</i>
-(beggar speaking Krill)

42:32.594 --> 42:34.054
<i>Do'maflach!</i>

42:34.137 --> 42:35.972
-What does he want?
-Keep moving.

42:36.806 --> 42:37.807
<i>Do'maflach!</i>

42:38.266 --> 42:39.559
Maybe you should just
buy some meat.

42:39.642 --> 42:41.895
-Do not speak!
-(grunts)

42:44.981 --> 42:46.775
(intense music playing)

42:49.819 --> 42:50.779
(groans)

42:57.035 --> 42:59.954
-You will come with us.
-Who are you?

43:00.038 --> 43:01.748
All will be explained.

43:01.831 --> 43:03.041
Now move!

43:07.671 --> 43:09.464
(intense music playing)

43:23.520 --> 43:25.230
(crowd speaking Krill)

43:33.697 --> 43:35.156
(panel beeping)

43:49.379 --> 43:50.380
Where is she?

43:53.341 --> 43:54.634
(beeping)

44:06.187 --> 44:09.315
What's going on?
What is this all about?

44:09.983 --> 44:11.443
She is yours.

44:11.901 --> 44:12.902
What do you mean?

44:13.361 --> 44:15.196
She is your daughter.

44:20.910 --> 44:23.163
-What?
-You had...

44:23.913 --> 44:26.499
an intimate relationship
with Teleya.

44:27.542 --> 44:28.918
Yes, I did, but...

44:29.002 --> 44:31.338
You are her father.

44:40.388 --> 44:43.641
That's... Teleya's daughter?

44:48.063 --> 44:49.272
Why is she here?

44:49.356 --> 44:50.982
Teleya feared that if
anyone learned

44:51.066 --> 44:54.069
of the child's existence,
it would lead to scandal,

44:54.152 --> 44:56.404
and destroy her political
ambitions.

44:56.488 --> 44:58.448
She provides for
the girl's needs,

44:58.531 --> 45:00.450
but has no contact with her.

45:00.533 --> 45:02.452
I have been the child's
caretaker

45:02.535 --> 45:04.496
since the day she was born.

45:04.579 --> 45:07.916
You can see... she
is half human.

45:10.293 --> 45:11.753
Does she know about me?

45:11.836 --> 45:13.505
She does not.

45:13.588 --> 45:15.340
It is best that way.

45:18.802 --> 45:20.011
Can I talk to her?

45:30.480 --> 45:31.648
Hi there.

45:32.273 --> 45:33.400
Hello.

45:34.734 --> 45:35.860
What's your name?

45:35.944 --> 45:37.445
Anaya.

45:37.529 --> 45:38.947
That's a pretty name.

45:39.030 --> 45:40.198
What's yours?

45:40.573 --> 45:41.783
I'm Ed.

45:41.908 --> 45:43.743
That's a funny name.

45:43.827 --> 45:45.245
You look funny.

45:46.079 --> 45:47.831
Thanks. I get that a lot.
(chuckles)

45:50.834 --> 45:52.335
You have a nice house.

45:52.711 --> 45:54.170
Thank you.

45:55.213 --> 45:57.382
-Do you like it here?
-Yes.

45:58.133 --> 45:59.718
Do they take good care of you?

45:59.801 --> 46:01.344
I have my own room.

46:01.428 --> 46:02.804
I have lots of toys,

46:02.887 --> 46:05.098
and I get to eat
whatever I want.

46:05.181 --> 46:06.766
Sounds pretty good.

46:10.854 --> 46:12.188
I-I don't know how.

46:12.272 --> 46:14.315
It's easy. I'll show you.

46:20.864 --> 46:23.825
Wow. You know,
you're really smart.

46:23.908 --> 46:25.869
She is quite extraordinary.

46:27.537 --> 46:28.872
Yeah.

46:29.581 --> 46:30.665
Yeah, she is.

46:30.749 --> 46:32.208
Do you feel shame?

46:33.376 --> 46:37.547
No. No, why would I?

46:37.630 --> 46:40.508
Some would look at Anaya
and see an abomination.

46:40.717 --> 46:43.261
I see a beautiful child.

46:43.345 --> 46:46.765
And something much more: Hope.

46:47.307 --> 46:49.642
We are part of a coalition
that believes

46:49.726 --> 46:52.437
that a treaty with the Union
is still possible.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.897
Given the outcome
of the election,

46:53.980 --> 46:56.316
it would take a miracle
to make it happen now.

46:56.399 --> 46:58.234
Anaya could be that miracle.

46:59.194 --> 47:00.195
What do you mean?

47:00.362 --> 47:03.573
You must show the child
to all of Krill.

47:03.656 --> 47:07.369
Her mother will no longer
be able to deny her existence.

47:08.828 --> 47:10.497
You want me to...

47:10.580 --> 47:13.708
embarrass Teleya in order to
bring down her government,

47:13.792 --> 47:14.959
-is that it?
-No.

47:15.043 --> 47:16.711
That would accomplish
nothing.

47:16.795 --> 47:19.255
Someone else like her
would eventually take her place.

47:19.339 --> 47:22.342
There is always another Teleya.

47:22.425 --> 47:24.636
You must persuade her

47:24.719 --> 47:28.056
to stand up with you and
acknowledge the child.

47:28.682 --> 47:31.351
Some of her supporters
will feel betrayed,

47:31.434 --> 47:35.980
but others may reconsider their
hostility toward the Union.

47:36.064 --> 47:40.777
Anaya could become a
powerful symbol of coexistence.

47:40.860 --> 47:43.822
She might turn the
tide toward peace.

47:46.741 --> 47:48.702
First off, Teleya and
I are not exactly

47:48.785 --> 47:51.121
on the best of terms right now.

47:51.204 --> 47:53.790
Did you know that she decided
to let you live?

47:55.041 --> 47:57.502
-What?
-That is why she released you.

47:57.585 --> 48:00.547
We have an informant
in her security detail.

48:00.630 --> 48:03.717
The guards had orders
to take you back to your ship.

48:03.800 --> 48:07.262
Evidently, Captain,
she still cares about you.

48:08.805 --> 48:09.681
(sighs)

48:12.934 --> 48:15.228
I'm gonna need a ride back
to the capital.

48:27.198 --> 48:28.867
Goodbye, Anaya.

48:29.743 --> 48:31.870
It was very nice to meet you.

48:41.421 --> 48:43.423
(intense music playing)

48:52.515 --> 48:54.142
Admiral Ozawa is hailing.

48:54.225 --> 48:55.477
Put her through.

48:56.061 --> 48:57.395
<i>Status report, Commander.</i>

48:57.479 --> 48:58.521
No change, sir.

48:58.605 --> 49:00.065
<i>Then we prepare to go in.</i>

49:00.148 --> 49:02.275
<i>We'll avoid a firefight</i>
<i>if we can,</i>

49:02.359 --> 49:04.694
<i>but if the Krill refuse</i>
<i>to release our people...</i>

49:04.778 --> 49:06.071
Understood.

49:06.154 --> 49:08.406
<i>Set a course for Krill,</i>
<i>maximum speed.</i>

49:08.490 --> 49:10.408
With pleasure.

49:29.469 --> 49:30.512
Leave us.

49:37.060 --> 49:39.062
Explain yourself!

49:39.729 --> 49:40.980
You were gonna let me go.

49:41.690 --> 49:45.902
You stupid fool!
Why did you come back here?

49:45.985 --> 49:47.987
Why did you set me free?

49:48.071 --> 49:49.739
You freed me once.

49:49.823 --> 49:51.908
I was simply repaying the debt.

49:52.701 --> 49:55.829
(sighs) I do not wish
to kill you.

49:56.454 --> 49:57.914
I've seen Anaya.

49:59.666 --> 50:00.792
What?

50:01.543 --> 50:02.919
Our daughter.

50:04.295 --> 50:05.797
I've seen her.

50:06.464 --> 50:08.591
-I've talked to her.
-You have been deceived.

50:08.675 --> 50:10.385
Oh, I don't think so.

50:12.095 --> 50:13.388
She's...

50:13.972 --> 50:15.432
she's amazing.

50:17.392 --> 50:18.685
She even looks like you.

50:21.104 --> 50:22.814
I can't even imagine
how difficult it must've been

50:22.897 --> 50:24.024
for you to give her up.

50:24.649 --> 50:26.901
The child is not
of pure blood.

50:26.985 --> 50:28.486
She will have a better life
away from

50:28.570 --> 50:30.655
the scornful eyes of the public.

50:33.074 --> 50:35.160
What is it the
Anhkana teaches?

50:35.243 --> 50:38.413
"With every child,
a new world is born."

50:40.165 --> 50:42.292
"Gently Falling Rain."

50:42.625 --> 50:43.793
What?

50:43.877 --> 50:48.089
That is what it
means-- "Anaya."

50:49.507 --> 50:51.343
The name I gave to her.

50:51.426 --> 50:52.844
It's beautiful.

50:57.766 --> 50:59.768
We should be celebrating her.

50:59.851 --> 51:01.936
We should be standing with her,
side by side...

51:02.020 --> 51:04.147
-No.
-...showing the entire galaxy

51:04.230 --> 51:05.690
-that we can all coexist.
-No.

51:05.774 --> 51:07.108
-She is living proof of that.
-No.

51:07.192 --> 51:08.443
-We created a life together,
-No.

51:08.526 --> 51:09.611
-Teleya!
-No, no, no!

51:09.694 --> 51:11.154
Well, then what did you
have her for?

51:11.738 --> 51:12.906
What did you have her for,

51:12.989 --> 51:14.491
if you were just gonna keep her
locked away

51:14.574 --> 51:16.326
-like some kind of criminal?
-Oh!

51:16.409 --> 51:19.537
How human of you to
ask that question.

51:19.621 --> 51:22.874
But then you terminate
life with abandon, do you not?

51:22.957 --> 51:24.459
Would you like to
see what happens

51:24.542 --> 51:27.504
to those who commit
such murderous acts on Krill?

51:35.595 --> 51:36.763
Supreme Chancellor!

51:36.846 --> 51:38.765
No, please. Continue
with your work.

51:38.848 --> 51:40.892
With gratitude, Chancellor.

52:01.246 --> 52:02.414
Who are they?

52:02.497 --> 52:05.166
Parents to a child
who will never be.

52:05.750 --> 52:08.712
They were caught after
terminating a life in the womb.

52:08.795 --> 52:11.881
Those who do so are brought
to a facility like this one.

52:11.965 --> 52:15.593
Their DNA is extracted,
and a genetic profile is used

52:15.677 --> 52:18.388
to create a simulation of
the child that could have been.

52:19.305 --> 52:21.975
So they may see the life
they have destroyed.

52:22.058 --> 52:23.810
(breathing unsteadily)

52:26.980 --> 52:28.231
Are you my mother?

52:30.483 --> 52:33.069
I would have loved
so much to be with you.

52:33.153 --> 52:35.113
I wish you had not sent me away.

52:35.196 --> 52:36.740
(sobbing)

52:40.994 --> 52:42.495
(sobs)

52:43.038 --> 52:45.290
Jesus Christ, Teleya.

52:45.373 --> 52:46.624
Is this the kind of world

52:46.708 --> 52:48.543
you want your daughter
to grow up in?

52:49.377 --> 52:50.378
Our daughter?

52:51.671 --> 52:53.631
Take Captain Mercer
back to his cell.

53:18.198 --> 53:23.161
(crowd roaring, jeering)

53:23.244 --> 53:25.497
(dramatic music playing)

53:36.466 --> 53:38.677
(chanting "Teleya!")

53:42.389 --> 53:46.226
I have promised you the blood
of our enemies,

53:46.309 --> 53:48.186
and you shall have it!

53:48.269 --> 53:50.021
(crowd roaring)

53:54.567 --> 53:57.987
These are the co-conspirators
to whom Korin the traitor

53:58.071 --> 54:01.658
was prepared
to relinquish our sovereignty!

54:02.742 --> 54:04.494
(jeering)

54:06.162 --> 54:08.915
Liars and demons all.

54:08.998 --> 54:10.834
Enemies of Avis.

54:12.127 --> 54:16.172
Today, they will know justice!

54:23.763 --> 54:25.724
(dramatic music playing)

54:29.352 --> 54:31.354
(intense music playing)

54:39.404 --> 54:41.614
Talla, open a channel
to Krill.

54:41.698 --> 54:44.159
-Anyone in particular?
-General frequency.

54:44.242 --> 54:45.827
See if anyone answers the phone.

54:45.910 --> 54:47.537
-(monitor beeps)
-You're on, sir.

54:47.620 --> 54:49.247
This is Commander
Kelly Grayson

54:49.330 --> 54:50.707
of the starship Orville.

54:50.832 --> 54:53.626
As you can see, I'm back,
and I've brought a few friends.

54:53.710 --> 54:55.587
So I'm only going
to tell you once:

54:55.670 --> 54:58.214
release our people,
and we will leave peacefully.

54:59.215 --> 55:01.092
What is your response?

55:01.593 --> 55:03.803
Which of these creatures

55:03.887 --> 55:07.515
shall be the first to
taste the blade?

55:07.599 --> 55:09.392
(crowd roaring)

55:10.143 --> 55:11.353
(whispers)

55:12.312 --> 55:15.523
Launch all forces
to intercept. Obliterate them.

55:17.108 --> 55:19.527
Their planetary defense system
has been activated.

55:19.611 --> 55:21.863
Multiple Krill vessels
are closing on our position.

55:21.946 --> 55:24.949
That's our answer. Go to
red alert. Battle stations.

55:33.249 --> 55:35.502
(crowd chanting "Teleya!")

55:36.086 --> 55:39.172
Teleya. It's not too
late to stop this.

55:41.841 --> 55:43.426
My dear Captain...

55:43.968 --> 55:46.471
I am just getting started.

55:46.554 --> 55:48.390
(crowd chanting "Teleya!")

55:53.353 --> 55:54.688
This one!

55:54.771 --> 55:56.523
(crowd roaring)

56:01.945 --> 56:03.655
-Ugh!
-(crowd cheering)

56:10.120 --> 56:12.372
-(groaning)
-(grenades sparking)

56:14.374 --> 56:16.334
(alarm sounding)

56:25.301 --> 56:26.845
(hovercar humming)

56:30.098 --> 56:31.558
(Alcuzan groaning)

56:31.641 --> 56:33.143
What's going on? Who are you?

56:33.226 --> 56:34.811
Reporting for duty, sir.

56:34.894 --> 56:36.438
-Commander Lamarr?
-At your service.

56:36.521 --> 56:38.523
-Directive 21.
-You know it.

56:38.606 --> 56:40.442
You've lost some blood,
but you're gonna be okay.

56:40.525 --> 56:41.860
Claire!

56:42.444 --> 56:43.737
Microdermal makeover.

56:43.945 --> 56:45.113
Trust me, Mr. President,

56:45.196 --> 56:46.531
I'm much better-looking
in person.

56:46.614 --> 56:48.533
You're a welcome sight
to me, Doctor.

56:48.616 --> 56:50.660
Everybody hang on,
we're not out of this yet.

56:50.744 --> 56:52.829
(dramatic music playing)

57:15.852 --> 57:17.103
Isaac, anything?

57:17.395 --> 57:19.647
ISAAC: <i>Commander Lamarr</i>
<i>has activated his transponder.</i>

57:19.731 --> 57:21.566
<i>They are moving away</i>
<i>from the capital.</i>

57:40.627 --> 57:43.672
-Where's your shuttle?
-Bearing 3-7-5 mark one.

57:48.218 --> 57:50.053
-(alarm pinging)
-Uh-oh.

57:50.136 --> 57:52.305
-What's wrong?
-The nav system just went out.

58:02.065 --> 58:04.234
You do know where you're
going, right?

58:04.317 --> 58:05.944
I mean, this kind
of looks familiar.

58:06.027 --> 58:07.445
-Oh, boy.
-It's okay,

58:07.529 --> 58:09.322
we got a navigator right here.
Help me out, Charly.

58:09.406 --> 58:11.074
-There! Make a right!
-You sure?

58:11.157 --> 58:12.200
Nope.

58:20.792 --> 58:22.293
-Ow!
-Easy, John!

58:22.419 --> 58:23.294
Sorry!

58:33.555 --> 58:35.473
(ships clang)

58:47.736 --> 58:49.571
Okay. Okay, yeah, that's it.

59:07.339 --> 59:08.298
(clangs)

59:19.851 --> 59:21.102
Commander, I am tracking
the shuttle,

59:21.186 --> 59:23.021
400 kilometers and closing.

59:31.029 --> 59:32.364
Well, that doesn't look good.

59:44.167 --> 59:46.252
ISAAC: <i>The shuttle</i>
<i>has sustained heavy damage.</i>

59:46.336 --> 59:49.464
-What's their position?
-Bearing 121 mark six.

59:51.257 --> 59:53.426
Lay down fire
and get us into docking range.

01:00:04.437 --> 01:00:06.147
Open the bay doors.

01:00:17.158 --> 01:00:18.451
They're secure!

01:00:20.078 --> 01:00:21.996
Grayson to Ozawa.
We have the delegation.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.456
I suggest we get the
hell outta here.

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.458
OZAWA: <i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Ozawa to all ships:</i>

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:27.043
<i>disengage and retreat.</i>

01:00:27.127 --> 01:00:29.421
-Set a course for Earth.
-Aye, sir!

01:00:56.489 --> 01:00:58.742
I'm pleased to report
that President Alcuzan

01:00:58.825 --> 01:01:00.160
is going to make
a full recovery.

01:01:00.285 --> 01:01:02.871
He plans to address
the Union Council later today.

01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:05.582
It was all looking
so hopeful just a few days ago.

01:01:05.665 --> 01:01:09.336
There is... one card left
to play. If we want to.

01:01:10.545 --> 01:01:11.421
(sighs)

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.006
Anaya.

01:01:13.089 --> 01:01:15.925
Revealing her could
force Teleya's hand.

01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:17.218
Admiral...

01:01:17.385 --> 01:01:20.930
she didn't ask to be
born into the eye of a storm.

01:01:21.097 --> 01:01:22.307
And I gotta be honest,

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:24.893
I'm not so sure Teleya wouldn't
make her disappear

01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:26.436
just to protect the regime.

01:01:26.603 --> 01:01:28.772
You really think
she'd be capable of that?

01:01:28.855 --> 01:01:30.065
I thought I knew her.

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:31.858
I don't.

01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:33.568
She's your daughter.

01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:36.446
The President is leaving
it up to you.

01:01:37.655 --> 01:01:38.990
Tell him thank you.

01:01:52.504 --> 01:01:56.758
It's very possible
that I'll never see her again.

01:01:58.134 --> 01:02:00.095
Well, that'd be a shame.

01:02:01.179 --> 01:02:03.264
I always thought you'd make
a terrific father.

01:02:03.973 --> 01:02:05.058
I'm...

01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:07.894
sad we never got that far.

01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:10.689
Me too.

01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:15.360
It's almost like yesterday
was one life,

01:02:15.443 --> 01:02:16.903
and today is another.

01:02:18.196 --> 01:02:20.824
And everything's different
on this side of time.

01:02:21.408 --> 01:02:23.284
Yeah, it is.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:27.622
At least you know she's
in a safe place,

01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:29.124
and well cared for.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:32.419
I miss her.

01:02:33.628 --> 01:02:34.754
Is that weird to say?

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.050
I only met her once.

01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:40.677
I don't even know her.

01:02:41.594 --> 01:02:42.637
And I miss her.

01:02:45.181 --> 01:02:46.057
(sighs)

01:02:46.558 --> 01:02:48.018
The treaty is dead.

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:53.189
But we have to find a way
to preserve some kind of peace.

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:56.317
For Anaya.

01:03:03.992 --> 01:03:05.326
You wanna have breakfast
with me?

01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:08.997
(slight chuckle)

01:03:26.848 --> 01:03:29.476
(contemplative music playing)

01:04:06.721 --> 01:04:08.640
(theme song playing)
