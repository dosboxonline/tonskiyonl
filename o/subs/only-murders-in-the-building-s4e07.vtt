09:45.752 --> 09:48.046
And I'm starving right now!

09:48.046 --> 09:50.048
I'm so hungry. Ugh, that looks gross.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.092
I need something substantial.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.471
You know what? I think I saw pizza crust
on the driveway boat, I'll be right back.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.933

- What is my life?

10:02.352 --> 10:03.645

10:04.271 --> 10:06.315
- [yelps, laughs]
- [laughs]

10:06.315 --> 10:08.192
- My apologies. I--
- Oh, no.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.736
I just had a craving for a Tulsa Torpedo.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.863
- Oh.
- I mean, but I see that

10:12.863 --> 10:15.282
you've misplaced your
watermelon liqueur.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.910
Oh, why don't I make you
one of my signature cocktails?

10:17.910 --> 10:20.287
Okay? Lemme just...
Right behind you. If I--

10:20.287 --> 10:23.040
- I almost got it. Here we go.
- [awkward laugh]

10:23.040 --> 10:25.334
I think you are going to like.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.629
This is mostly entirely
vodka and Crystal Light.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.547
You know, I call it a Sweaty Betty.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.967
Named it after my dear friend,
also named Betty,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.428
uh, who also happens to sweat like a pig.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.513
Uh-huh...

10:37.513 --> 10:39.890
So... there we go.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.976
And Crystal Light,
if you dunk anything in it,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.228
- it's a great exfoliant.
- Uh...

10:44.228 --> 10:46.230
- Ah.
- A long pour...

10:46.230 --> 10:48.315
- Ah...
- ...for my short king.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.692
- Well, here's to Betty.
- Oh, Betty was a whore.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.027
Okay.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.820
[Doreen]
Mm...

10:54.530 --> 10:56.448
- [Oliver snorts]
- Can you believe it?

10:56.448 --> 10:57.574
Oh my, that's...

10:57.574 --> 11:00.118
- Mm. I know.
- Oh! Th-That is--

11:00.118 --> 11:01.995
[sucks teeth] Okay--

11:01.995 --> 11:03.622
- Now...
- [Oliver grumbling]

11:03.622 --> 11:06.083
...I can't help but notice
you seem like something's

11:06.083 --> 11:08.460
maybe bothering you. Is it Charles?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.088
W-Well, no. Uh-- Well,

11:11.713 --> 11:13.841
usually yes, but, uh,

11:13.841 --> 11:15.509
uh, this time, it's a breakup.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.679
A relationship done in by my...

11:18.679 --> 11:20.597
one tragic flaw.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.182
Too handsome?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.852
Well, th-there's that, but it's also...

11:24.852 --> 11:26.728
I-I'm simply too...

11:27.396 --> 11:28.689
emotionally available.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.148

Actors? Now what are you doing here?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.912
[Zach Galifianakis]
Howard told us you would be here.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.789
People don't keep secrets from the famous.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.625
What are you doing here?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.127
Uh, I'm hiding out from the killer.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.921
Oh, so you thought,
"Hey, why don't we leave the actors

11:52.921 --> 11:54.464
to die with a psychopath"?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.467
Pretty sure the killer
is after us, not you guys.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.470
I would reconsider that.
Just a gut feeling.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.638
[Mabel]
Oh!

12:01.638 --> 12:03.557
[Zach] I escaped the hospital
to come here.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.768
Well, go back to the hospital!
And for you guys,

12:06.768 --> 12:09.229
I need some quiet to work
on the case, okay?

12:09.229 --> 12:12.024
- I'm sure there's lovely local hotels.
- [Eva Longoria] No, no, no, no.

12:12.024 --> 12:15.319
You are contractually responsible
for our safety, so we're staying.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.697
Fine! Then pick a doll, amuse yourselves,

12:18.697 --> 12:20.365

I mean...

12:24.870 --> 12:28.165
I thought that I wanted
a creative counterpart.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.249
Yeah. Yeah.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.419
A Verdon to my Fosse.
A Fleetwood to my Mac.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.504
Oh.

12:33.504 --> 12:36.465
Maybe what I really want...

12:37.758 --> 12:40.385
is just someone I can hold

12:40.385 --> 12:42.471
- and adore, you know?
- [Doreen sighs]

12:42.471 --> 12:44.264
- Like a doll.
- [Oliver grunts]

12:44.264 --> 12:46.183
- Sure. Sure, like a doll.
- Like a doll.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.019
How'd you meet your husband?

12:49.019 --> 12:51.855
You know what, this is--
shouldn't be here.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.028
you know, it was actually...

12:58.904 --> 13:01.615
a pretty classic meet-cute. It was...

13:12.167 --> 13:13.961
Alright. Ooh, I'm like a turtle.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.421

- Oh, lemme help you. There you go.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.591
[grunting] Okay. Okay.

Hello--

13:25.430 --> 13:27.683
- [♪ upbeat music playing]
- [Doreen] Oh. Let yourself in.

13:27.683 --> 13:28.976
What on earth?

13:28.976 --> 13:30.769
[nervous laugh] Hi.

13:30.769 --> 13:34.231
I j-- I just got caught in
her macramé duster.

13:34.231 --> 13:37.276
Oh, is that what the kids
are calling it now? [laughs]

13:37.276 --> 13:39.736
This one. What a tease, huh?

13:42.199 --> 13:44.449
[Oliver]
Loretta, how did you find out--

13:44.449 --> 13:47.244
Howard! Of course, it was Howard.

13:47.244 --> 13:51.123
I called repeatedly,
straight to voicemail every time.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.834
So, I got on a six-hour flight,

13:53.834 --> 13:54.918
middle seat,

13:54.918 --> 13:57.254
just so I could ask you
why you thought you could...

13:58.714 --> 14:01.091
break up with me over text.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.676
Uh-- Loretta...

14:03.260 --> 14:04.678
what are you talking about?

14:04.678 --> 14:06.930
I poured my heart out to you

14:06.930 --> 14:09.558
on the phone, and you went, "Ugh."

14:09.558 --> 14:10.767
When did this happen?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.269
- Yesterday. Yes--
- No, you didn't.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.355
A-A day that will live in ugh-famy.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.692
[sighs] What time was it?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.152
I don't know, lunch?

14:20.152 --> 14:22.905
- Devastation o'clock.
- Your lunch or my lunch?

14:22.905 --> 14:25.782
I-It was your lunch, my second Cosmo.

14:28.452 --> 14:31.914
Oh! [laughs]

14:31.914 --> 14:35.292
Oh, I-I love that my pain
is so amusing to you.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.711
- That is just so appreciated.
- [Loretta wheezing]

14:37.711 --> 14:40.297
- No! Oh, Oliver.
- [♪ jaunty music playing]

14:40.297 --> 14:42.925
I think you talked to my stand-in.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.593
- What? Sorry, what?
- Yeah.

14:44.593 --> 14:47.679
Because I'm wrapped in gauze,
and my stand-in is wrapped in gauze,

14:47.679 --> 14:50.516
so I think the-the PA gave my cellphone

14:50.516 --> 14:53.852
[laughing] to the wrong burn victim.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.271

- So, that wasn't you?

15:00.234 --> 15:03.737
I don't think you're ugh. [sighs]

15:03.737 --> 15:05.697

- Oh, Ollie!
- [Oliver laughs]

15:15.791 --> 15:19.837
- Oh, I missed you. I missed you.
- I missed you. I missed you, too.

15:19.837 --> 15:23.924
- So... Doreen.
- Oh.

15:24.508 --> 15:28.220
Doreen?
Well, Doreen is Charles' sister.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.805
Is she someone...

15:30.681 --> 15:32.224
that I should be worried about?

15:32.224 --> 15:35.060
Everyone should be worried about Doreen.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.856
[Doreen]
Careful, Upchuck!

15:38.856 --> 15:42.693
[laughs] Oh, you need me to help you nail
your fingers to the house, huh?

15:42.693 --> 15:44.987
These windows won't lock,
so I'm trying to nail them shut.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.738
Just trying to keep
everybody in one piece.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.491
Well, it's a little late
to keep me in one piece.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.829
I asked the doctor
if I could give you my spleen,

15:53.829 --> 15:55.747
and he said it wasn't necessary

15:55.747 --> 15:57.541
because spleens aren't necessary.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.544
Oh, come on. I was just razzin' you.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.504
I don't even remember the accident!

God, I must've been, what, 5?

16:12.973 --> 16:14.266

have a conversation right now.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.996
Everyone I know is either
dead or in danger

16:35.996 --> 16:38.498
because of me and my stupid podcast,

16:38.498 --> 16:42.377
so I have to keep my attention
focused on these nails!

16:42.377 --> 16:45.797
- [light hammering]
- Why are you always mad at me?!

16:46.715 --> 16:48.425
I'm not mad at you.

Wait, wait, wait, are you--
are you crying?

16:50.469 --> 16:52.012
Oh, please don't cry.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.514
I can cry if I want to!

16:53.514 --> 16:57.434
Just because you,
Mr. No-Emotion-Robot-Man, doesn't!

16:57.434 --> 16:59.228
I-I control myself.

16:59.228 --> 17:02.272
Oh, wh-what's that?
Implying that I'm crazy?!

17:02.272 --> 17:03.982
- I didn't say that.
- Don't deny it.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.359
- Well, I didn't say that.
- Don't!

17:05.359 --> 17:06.527
I said don't!

17:06.527 --> 17:09.446
Don't deny it! Not do deny it!
I said don't deny it!

17:09.446 --> 17:12.241
TikTok calls it gaslighting.

17:12.241 --> 17:14.868
And you're full of gas,
and it's an epidemic!

17:14.868 --> 17:17.246
Every man in my life
thinks that because I have

17:17.246 --> 17:20.958
just actual and real emotions
that I'm crazy!

17:20.958 --> 17:23.585
But, you know what? There's a little man,

17:23.585 --> 17:26.338
a tiny, little man downstairs right now

17:26.338 --> 17:30.259
who appreciates a woman with
a nice, big set of emotions.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.761
[♪ melancholy music playing]

17:32.761 --> 17:35.681

[Eugene Levy]
We're bored.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.690

- What?

And can you open this snick-snack?
My assistant's not here.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.117
Okay, I need to work on the case.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.953
So, um, could you actors maybe run lines

17:57.953 --> 18:00.664
or do Ozempic,
whatever you guys do?

18:00.664 --> 18:01.915
[Loretta]
Don't wanna interrupt you.

18:01.915 --> 18:05.294

Loretta...?

18:21.226 --> 18:24.938
We did that stage adaptation
of James Bond's <i>Moonraker.</i>

18:24.938 --> 18:27.774
I mean, I'm trying to place the face,
but, uh,

18:27.774 --> 18:29.484
I'm coming up empty.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.112
I was Lieutenant Holly Goodhead.

Hey, I'm sorry, it's just the actors
wanna help with the case.

- Yeah.
- Um,

18:58.680 --> 19:01.517
do you think you can take them out to play
or distract them with your keys?

19:01.517 --> 19:05.103
[sighs] Okay, but I think
you're making a big mistake.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.481

Of the human condition.

I would love to hang with actors!

19:31.880 --> 19:34.633
Where are the "actors"?

19:34.633 --> 19:38.136
Actors, all sitting together,

19:38.136 --> 19:40.013
Hey, actors!

19:40.806 --> 19:42.266
Fuck you!

Okay, Mom.

Fuck you, TV actor.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.773
[gasps] You know my work?

19:49.773 --> 19:52.526
"Work"? Let me sum up
the quality of your

19:57.656 --> 19:58.657
Oh.

19:58.657 --> 20:02.244
[Bev] I'm sick of this bullshit studio,
and the script

20:02.244 --> 20:05.831
with its bullshit plot holes,
and all you self-centered actors,

20:05.831 --> 20:07.666

20:07.666 --> 20:10.627
and your little baby set slippers,

I was shot! And I bet it's infected!
I am weeping fluid here!

20:16.175 --> 20:19.011
Oh, my God, Zach, cut it out!

20:19.011 --> 20:20.721
All you do is complain.

20:22.723 --> 20:26.518
"I-I got hit by a sniper,
and now I have a boo-boo!"

Actors, let's talk case.

who is cashing my close
personal friend's checks.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.639
- No.
- I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.

21:03.639 --> 21:05.599
Please! Please, let me just
have a look at that ledger.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.392
Sorry, it's against our policy.

21:07.392 --> 21:10.395
You're a bodega.
You barely have a hand-washing policy.

[Mabel]
It all happened the night that Sazz died.

21:56.316 --> 22:00.362
Then the killer texted us,
"I'm watching you," so we came here.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.614
There. Now, you know everything we know.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.409

22:05.409 --> 22:07.828
Mabel, you really have no idea

22:07.828 --> 22:11.832
about the breadth of our skill set here.

22:11.832 --> 22:14.459
Only 3% of our time is devoted

22:15.210 --> 22:16.461
to the actual job.

22:16.461 --> 22:19.381
The rest is spent developing talents

22:19.381 --> 22:23.468
that would be helpful in
a character's backstory, like, uh...

22:24.636 --> 22:30.267

- Yes.

23:19.858 --> 23:22.027
So, we have a long-distance relationship,
