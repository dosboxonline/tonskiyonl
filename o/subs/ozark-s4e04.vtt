00:06.006 --> 00:08.299
[crowd applauding]

00:10.051 --> 00:11.845
[Wendy on mic] Thank you, Clare.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.304
Hello everyone.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.682
A few people have asked me

00:15.765 --> 00:19.352
why the Byrde Family Foundation
would be willing to work with a company

00:19.936 --> 00:21.604
like Shaw Medical Solutions

00:21.688 --> 00:25.025
when many people today
feel that that company

00:25.984 --> 00:28.486
is the cause of the problem
that we're here to fight.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.405
And I won't argue with that.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.700
They are culpable.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.286
What I will tell you

00:36.369 --> 00:38.496
is that it would have been easy

00:38.580 --> 00:40.749
for Clare Shaw and her company

00:40.832 --> 00:42.792
to pay their fines and move on.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.212
Many pharmaceutical companies
have done just that.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.841
They refuse to engage with
the communities that they've damaged.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.093
They refuse to admit
they've even made a mistake,

00:52.177 --> 00:55.346
let alone attempt directly
to put that right.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.516
Clare Shaw has changed that.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.686
She wants to make up
for the mistakes of Shaw Medical.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.940
To put their money where their mouth is
and make a difference to the communities

01:06.024 --> 01:08.151
that have been hardest hit
by the opioid crisis.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.071
And that's why the Byrde Family Foundation

01:11.154 --> 01:13.823
is proud to work alongside Shaw Medical

01:13.907 --> 01:16.868
to deliver three new
regional rehabilitation centers

01:16.951 --> 01:18.578
right here in the Ozarks.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.582
It is hard to find a family in the Midwest

01:23.166 --> 01:25.460
that has not been touched
by the opioid crisis.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.429
Including my own.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.309
My younger brother, Ben…

01:42.685 --> 01:44.896
has battled with
addiction issues his entire life.

01:44.979 --> 01:48.233
That's why these centers
mean so much to me.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.027
That's why I'm willing

01:51.111 --> 01:53.613
to let Shaw Medical
make up for their mistakes.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.657
If Ben had found

01:55.740 --> 01:59.410
services like these as a younger man,
he would've gotten the help he needed,

01:59.494 --> 02:02.080
and my family would know
where my brother is today.

02:03.832 --> 02:07.752
Our hope one day
is that all families will be safe.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.133
Thank you.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.971
[engine turns over]

02:24.102 --> 02:26.104
[rhythmic pulse beating]

02:45.039 --> 02:46.958
Um, you need to catch the bus home today.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.085
I thought you had SAT prep.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.879
Mom needs me to cover the office.

02:53.089 --> 02:53.923
What?

02:54.799 --> 02:57.594
Prep's important.
Don't skip it just to make Mom happy.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.679
I'm not. I'll make it up.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.432
-I will!
-[phone buzzing]

03:04.976 --> 03:06.019
I gotta take this.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.025
-[Jonah] Hello?
-Hey, I need you to come over.

03:12.108 --> 03:15.195
We got too much fucking cash.
We need to think bigger on the refit.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.197
I had to buy a second fucking safe.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.324
I mean, it's a good problem to have,

03:19.407 --> 03:21.534
but we gotta get it washed, you know?

03:22.243 --> 03:25.038
I'll come over after school.
We can make a few night deposits.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.831
That'll relieve some of the overflow.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.085
Hey, uh, hold on one sec.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.466
Hey, Janet Rae! Get your butt over here.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.596
I got a complaint.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.181
Cash missing from room 12.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.182
What did you do?

03:44.682 --> 03:46.684
I didn't take nothing, I promise.

03:46.768 --> 03:51.022
Yeah, probably fell out
of a pocket or something.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.274
You know, I-- I'll bet
they'll find it under the bed

03:53.358 --> 03:55.193
when they get back
from the lake tonight, right?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.446
I bet they will.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.407
Good.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.290
Hear what I gotta deal with?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.542
If I thought I was
gonna have to run the place,

04:11.626 --> 04:13.336
I would have bought a fun business

04:13.419 --> 04:15.797
like a fucking jet ski shop or something.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.675
Why don't you hire a manager?
Someone you trust.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.885
Who the fuck do you trust around here?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.596
Then hire someone who's too stupid
to figure out what we're doing.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.473
[school bell ringing]

04:27.141 --> 04:28.977
[Sam] It's really great of you
to think of me.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.688
Mm. First name sprung to mind. I swear.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.022
Thanks. Look, uh…

04:33.815 --> 04:36.401
I know I screwed up
at Lickety Splitz. I get that.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.820
No, you screwed Jade.
There's a difference.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.697
You were still a good manager.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.158
-Yeah, did she tell you we broke up?
-No, we don't socialize.

04:44.242 --> 04:47.787
By text. Yeah, by text,
and she pawned my mom too.

04:48.579 --> 04:49.998
Your mom?

04:50.498 --> 04:53.209
Yeah, there's this process
where ashes can be pressed into--

04:53.293 --> 04:54.669
Know what? I don't wanna know.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.963
-Um--
-No, no no!

04:57.046 --> 04:59.382
-No! No! Fuck!
-[gambler shouting] No, no, no!

04:59.465 --> 05:01.175
[patrons whooping]

05:01.259 --> 05:02.844
[indistinct chattering]

05:03.886 --> 05:06.764
Uh, just come manage the Lazy-O for me

05:06.848 --> 05:09.851
and you'll make
more than enough to make Jade sorry.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.774
[in Spanish] I don't care. Hire security,

05:16.858 --> 05:20.069
do what you gotta do,
but don't let this happen again. Got it?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.197
Okay, bye.

05:23.906 --> 05:24.782
[phone beeps off]

05:26.909 --> 05:28.911
[sighs and mutters in Spanish]

05:30.163 --> 05:31.205
Do I need to worry?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.291
[sighs impatiently] About what?

05:33.374 --> 05:35.084
[Marty] About, you know, that.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.128
What-- What-- Whatever
you're worried about.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.758
[huffs] That's the third time this month
we've had a shipment seized.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.720
Wow. Another cash truck?

05:45.803 --> 05:48.097
-Like they knew it was coming.
-Hmm.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.142
Wow. Well, I mean, maybe that's-- what--

05:51.225 --> 05:53.936
a very small percentage
of your annual revenue. Yeah?

05:54.020 --> 05:57.565
Just maybe look at it as-- as breakage,
the price of doing business.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.900
[Javi] This is different.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.860
It is usually DEA.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.905
This time my guys saw FBI.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.616
FBI? Hmm.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.704
Maybe your fed can poke around.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.332
Find out if there's an informant.

06:15.041 --> 06:15.958
Uh…

06:17.502 --> 06:18.628
I'll ask.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.797
Give me her number. I'll ask.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.717
Oh, I… [chuckles]
I think she'll-- she'll only deal with me.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.429
Eyes on the road. Please.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.348
Yeah, I'll ask.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.851
[van beeping]

06:45.947 --> 06:47.198
[Javi] Lift your arms.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.330
All right, he's clean. Let's go.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.042
Gotta check the contents first.
Open that one.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.797
[Javi] It's pure.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.798
[device trills]

07:08.761 --> 07:10.430
-Now that one.
-It's all there, man.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.597
Let's just open it up.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.474
Thank you.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.195
[device trills]

07:28.656 --> 07:30.408
-[device trills]
-[Marty] We good?

07:30.992 --> 07:33.494
Good. Okay, let's load 'em up.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.620
Load 'em up.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.790
And, uh, this is
your, uh-- your air waybill,

07:37.874 --> 07:41.627
your customs manifest
and the dock receipt. Okay? So…

07:44.088 --> 07:45.089
All right?

07:47.842 --> 07:48.968
[phone chimes]

07:49.469 --> 07:50.470
[Wendy] News?

07:51.345 --> 07:53.347
The shipment's on its way to the factory.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.143
When will we know for sure?

07:57.768 --> 07:59.437
Once it lands in Springfield,

08:00.146 --> 08:02.190
they'll log it into the system.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.026
As long as nothing flags, we're fine.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.613
I will call Business Affairs
in the morning.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.948
You'll have your
first installment by 10:00 a.m.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.827
That's wonderful.
This is gonna make a huge difference.

08:16.662 --> 08:22.585
You know, even after my brother dragged
our family name through the mud,

08:22.668 --> 08:26.964
my father was still reluctant to give me
my shot at running the company.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.425
Don't worry.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.802
Marty is very good at this.

08:32.887 --> 08:33.763
He better be.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.850
[rap music blaring over speakers]

08:49.153 --> 08:50.154
Whoa, wait, you're…

08:50.238 --> 08:51.656
-[man] Yeah.
-[chuckling] Yeah!

08:51.739 --> 08:53.658
Come on. You're comin' with me.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.993
Sorry. Can't. Work shit.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.496
This is your limo service.
You gotta see how it rides.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.041
I'm guessing it rides like a fucking car.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.085
[chuckles]
I'm not takin' no for an answer.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.963
The truth is I'm fuckin' banned.
It's a long story.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.549
Fuck them. As much cash
as we throw down at that place?

09:09.632 --> 09:12.385
They're gonna have to let you in
with us. You! My man!

09:12.468 --> 09:13.302
Yes, Mr. Stone.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.428
You can cover, right?

09:14.512 --> 09:15.555
Of course, Mr. Stone.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.348
Of course he can cover.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.767
You're gonna start calling me
Ms. Langmore now?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.895
[chuckling]
Well, I mean, it's Kerry Stone.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.773
Eh, what the fuck.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.441
-Right? I dunno.
-That's my motto.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.985
-Don't fuck anything up.
-[Sam] Yup.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.403
[whistles]

09:30.486 --> 09:31.862
Don't fuck anything up.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.701
[Marty] Hey, everything okay?

09:36.784 --> 09:37.952
[Charlotte] Ruth's here.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.621
She's here with Kerry Stone
and a few other high rollers

09:40.705 --> 09:43.207
and they say they won't play
unless we let her in.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.460
Um, well, how-- how's she acting?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.796
I don't know. Annoyed.

09:48.879 --> 09:49.922
Impatient.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.340
You know…

09:52.425 --> 09:53.301
like Ruth.

09:53.801 --> 09:58.472
Ugh, for fuck's sake, Marty! I just
wanna play some cards with my friends!

09:59.181 --> 10:00.349
Charlotte, put her on.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.269
[Ruth clears her throat]

10:03.352 --> 10:05.938
-[Marty] Hey, what's going on?
-[Ruth] Nothing is going on.

10:06.022 --> 10:09.567
Jesus! And for the record,
the fact I'm not talking your high rollers

10:09.650 --> 10:12.820
out of coming to your casino
is a reason to thank me,

10:12.903 --> 10:15.031
not sic your fucking teenager on me.

10:15.114 --> 10:15.948
[men chuckle]

10:16.032 --> 10:17.617
I'm trusting you. Okay?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.453
[Ruth scoffs]
I'm just here to play cards. I promise.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.412
Got it.

10:21.912 --> 10:26.167
Tell Charlotte that I said it's okay
and that I'm on my way in, please.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.126
Bye.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.003
Move.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.298
-He's on his way.
-[Charlotte scoffs]

10:32.381 --> 10:33.716
[Javi] That was Charlotte?

10:34.508 --> 10:36.218
You should have said hello for me.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.932
Hey, what-- what the fuck are you doing?
Trying to get pulled over?

10:42.016 --> 10:44.602
Ah, why are you such a tight ass, Marty?

10:45.186 --> 10:46.020
Ándele.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.272
Oh, thank you.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.692
Cheers.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.695
[Javi laughing]

10:54.779 --> 10:56.781
[Kerry] Here we go, Ruth! Come on now!

10:56.864 --> 10:58.240
-[dealer] Eleven!
-Whoo!

10:58.324 --> 10:59.950
-Yeah!
-[gamblers cheering]

11:00.034 --> 11:02.286
-[chuckling] Yes.
-[Ruth chuckling] Yeah.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.788
Hey, Carla!

11:03.871 --> 11:06.791
Looks like more fun of this side
of the tables. Is this for you?

11:06.874 --> 11:09.043
No, that's for my friend Kerry here.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.295
You're not gonna make me
drink alone, are you?

11:11.379 --> 11:14.173
It's a bit early in the day for me.
[chuckles politely]

11:14.256 --> 11:15.257
Hit me, Carla.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.509
[dealer] Six. Easy six.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.177
[Kerry chuckling] Yeah!

11:21.514 --> 11:24.016
[reporter on TV]
…host to three new rehab centers.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.686
A local businesswoman
and co-founder of The Byrde Foundation…

11:26.769 --> 11:28.813
-What else can I get you?
-Just a water. Thanks.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.981
…Byrde was proud
to announce their partnership

11:31.065 --> 11:33.234
with pharmaceutical giant, Shaw Medical.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.069
[gamblers cheering]

11:35.152 --> 11:36.987
Hey, would you turn that up?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.532
My younger brother, Ben…

11:41.242 --> 11:43.619
has battled with
addiction issues his entire life.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.664
That's why these centers
mean so much to me.

11:47.206 --> 11:51.669
That's why I'm willing to let Shaw
Medical make up for their mistakes.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.796
If Ben had found

11:53.879 --> 11:57.508
services like these as a younger man,
he would've gotten the help he needed,

11:57.591 --> 12:00.219
and my family would know
where my brother is today.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.761
I don't think he's local.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.308
Okay.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.603
You mind how you go, Ruth.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.313
You bet I will.

28:55.525 --> 28:58.236
[indistinct police radio chatter]

29:03.241 --> 29:05.702
-[car door slams]
-[engine revs]

29:21.760 --> 29:23.261
[Wyatt] Is everything okay?

29:25.972 --> 29:27.223
She's just fishing.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.688
I should get back home.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.319
[groans]

29:40.737 --> 29:42.363
You can stay if you want.

29:43.823 --> 29:47.452
No, it's fine. Darlene will be worried.
Could you, uh, give me a ride?

29:51.581 --> 29:52.499
Sure.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.966
Have you had any other drug-related
incidents in the past?

30:02.926 --> 30:05.595
Certainly nothing-- nothing like this.

30:05.678 --> 30:09.015
Just the occasional weed smoking
in the parking lot, that kind of thing,

30:09.098 --> 30:11.434
and, uh, security usually handles that.

30:12.769 --> 30:15.104
Anyone known to law enforcement
hang out here?

30:15.605 --> 30:18.817
Known felons, parole violators, ex-cons?

30:23.321 --> 30:24.823
Sorry to be playing catch-up.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.450
Hazard of the acting sheriff gig.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.161
[Marty] No one we've been warned about.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.790
What about Ruth Langmore?

30:34.958 --> 30:37.126
-What about her?
-She was with the man who OD'd.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.087
She used to work for you, right?

30:39.629 --> 30:40.713
Yeah, she did.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.093
Can you tell me why you let her go?

30:45.176 --> 30:46.636
She quit, actually.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.472
Said she was looking for something bigger.

30:50.640 --> 30:54.644
And what exactly did
that bigger thing turn out to be?

30:54.727 --> 30:58.648
Uh, she bought the Lazy-O Motel

30:58.731 --> 31:00.817
and, uh-- and she runs that now.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.862
That's a lot of money for a girl her age.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.990
Well, it's, you know--
Have you seen it? [chuckles]

31:07.073 --> 31:11.035
Uh, we also, you know, we were paying
her extremely well when she was here.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.329
She said she was trying
to work with her cousin Wyatt.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.290
He lives with Darlene Snell.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.959
Maybe Darlene helped her out
with an influx of cash.

31:18.042 --> 31:23.006
Honestly, I-- I-- I think that,
you know, it's just, uh--

31:23.089 --> 31:26.426
The, uh-- The Lazy-O is--
You know, it's a shithole.

31:26.509 --> 31:27.969
[scoffs] Excuse my language.

31:28.052 --> 31:31.514
I'm pretty sure she probably just
qualified for a small business loan.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.849
That's, you know…

31:38.438 --> 31:40.106
-Well, thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.609
This has been illuminating.

31:43.109 --> 31:46.404
Yeah, okay, hope so.
Please enjoy the rest of your day.

31:46.487 --> 31:47.655
[Guerrero] Mm-hmm.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.246
What the fuck was that?

31:55.330 --> 31:57.248
I was just answering questions.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.585
You're pointing her straight to Ruth.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.754
We have no reason to protect her.

32:02.837 --> 32:03.671
No?

32:05.214 --> 32:08.760
Maybe you've forgotten
that our son works for Ruth.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.012
Ruth goes down, he goes down.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.473
Maybe it's the best thing for him.

32:13.556 --> 32:15.475
Tell me you're fucking joking.

32:15.558 --> 32:19.228
He's a juvenile.
His record will be sealed when he's 18.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.065
All right.
I'm not having this conversation.

32:22.148 --> 32:25.234
-We're losing him, Marty.
-And you want to just lock him up?

32:25.318 --> 32:29.113
-Is that what we should do?
-He won't serve time. We have connections.

32:29.197 --> 32:32.200
Maybe one night in the sheriff's lock-up.
Then he'll be home.

32:32.825 --> 32:36.496
-I want him home, Marty.
-I'm late for my own felony. See ya later.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.415
[door buzzes]

32:45.171 --> 32:46.255
[door clangs]

32:46.756 --> 32:48.049
[in Spanish] Hi, Santos.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.343
Are you okay?

32:51.511 --> 32:52.470
[Santos] I'm well.

32:53.012 --> 32:53.972
[Javi] That's good.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.266
Tell me what happened.

32:58.643 --> 33:02.063
[in Spanish] They had the road blocked.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.066
We couldn't back out

33:06.985 --> 33:08.069
and then they came.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.822
[in Spanish] Anyone new on the job?

33:10.905 --> 33:13.574
No. The same as always.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.785
How many FBI agents did you see?

33:16.285 --> 33:20.123
I don't know. Three… Maybe four.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.084
Did you see a woman?

33:24.752 --> 33:25.712
I don't know.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.301
[sighs] It's your job to fucking remember.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.638
So don't play stupid. Talk.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.640
There were so many agents.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.851
I didn't see faces, just uniforms.

33:39.934 --> 33:44.022
The police, border patrol,
the DEA, the FBI…

33:44.522 --> 33:48.609
[in English] He was facedown pretty fast.
Not surprised he can't identify anyone.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.698
Can you get the body cam footage?

33:54.782 --> 33:56.325
As part of discovery?

33:58.411 --> 33:59.704
Shouldn't be a problem.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.207
I want to see it the second you get it.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.171
[Zeke cooing]

34:15.344 --> 34:16.179
Hey.

34:18.014 --> 34:18.848
Hey.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.853
I'm sorry about last night.

34:25.521 --> 34:26.397
I know.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.774
[Zeke gurgling]

34:28.691 --> 34:30.526
[Darlene] Zeke's been missing you.

34:33.446 --> 34:34.447
[kisses]

34:38.034 --> 34:40.161
-Hey, buddy.
-[Zeke gurgles]

34:40.244 --> 34:42.580
[Darlene] Thanks for bringing him back.

34:42.663 --> 34:45.416
I suppose you saw Wendy Byrde on the news.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.169
Yeah, I-- I've seen it.

34:48.711 --> 34:51.005
Then you saw her tell that awful lie

34:51.506 --> 34:52.924
about your boyfriend.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.845
I'm sorry you had to hear
all this nonsense.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.932
That snake of a woman is a goddamn curse.

35:01.682 --> 35:04.435
Do you know she stole my rehab plan?

35:05.978 --> 35:07.730
I lost my permits.

35:08.689 --> 35:11.234
I would burn her at the stake

35:11.984 --> 35:14.779
if I didn't think the Devil himself
would come up and save her.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.533
Yeah. I'll, um…

35:20.326 --> 35:21.786
I'll see you later, Darlene.

35:22.870 --> 35:24.539
I'll see you later, sweetie.

35:29.043 --> 35:32.046
[ominous music playing]

35:40.555 --> 35:43.808
Hey! I want you to help me with something

35:44.308 --> 35:45.434
for your cousin.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.610
So, how was your stay, Mr. Stone?

35:57.488 --> 35:59.740
Great, thanks.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.159
That's good.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.914
Hey, um, can I ask you
a personal question?

36:08.583 --> 36:10.001
Sure. Why not?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.295
Do you make paella?

36:13.629 --> 36:14.630
I'm sorry?

36:14.714 --> 36:17.175
See, I tried to make paella
for my ex-fiancée

36:17.258 --> 36:19.635
and she told me
that it didn't taste authentic.

36:20.261 --> 36:23.764
So I figured since, you know,
you're right here in front of me,

36:23.848 --> 36:28.269
and you never know if you're gonna get
back together with someone that you might…

36:29.270 --> 36:30.730
What are we talking about?

36:30.813 --> 36:32.481
-A little chicken.
-Mm-hmm.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.816
-Sausage.
-Yeah.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.234
-Shrimp.
-Yep.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.903
-Calamari.
-Oh yeah.

36:36.986 --> 36:39.363
-Yeah. Maybe some chicken stock.
-Ooh, yeah.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.324
-And tomatoes. Onions.
-Mm-hmm.

36:41.407 --> 36:42.283
Exactly. Yeah.

36:42.366 --> 36:43.451
-Garlic.
-Yeah.

36:43.534 --> 36:44.619
-Mussels.
-Uh-huh.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.121
Yeah. You're fuckin' smothering it, man.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.458
-Wow, um…
-[brakes hissing]

36:50.541 --> 36:52.084
Yeah, uh, thank you for that.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.212
Yeah.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.228
My driver quit.
I'll-- I'll take you to the airport.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.442
You okay?

37:16.525 --> 37:19.445
No. But that's not your problem.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.740
I promise you'll be back in a limo
when you come back.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.118
I'm not coming back.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.788
It was just a bad night.

37:35.461 --> 37:36.796
I'm going on 40.

37:37.838 --> 37:41.842
And last night I almost died in a shithole
casino in the middle of shithole America.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.013
I didn't climb out of a place like this

37:46.097 --> 37:48.516
just to end up back in another one.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.313
I'm sorry.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.149
We're done.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.746
[phone line ringing]

38:11.914 --> 38:12.790
[Jonah] Hello?

38:13.541 --> 38:14.583
[man] Jonah?

38:14.667 --> 38:16.043
Yeah, this is Jonah.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.169
Oh. Hey, Granddad.

38:18.337 --> 38:19.880
You sound all grown up!

38:20.673 --> 38:23.050
Yeah, I guess my voice has changed.

38:23.718 --> 38:24.719
Is your mom home?

38:26.220 --> 38:27.555
Yeah, she's right here.

38:42.903 --> 38:43.863
Hey, Dad.

38:43.946 --> 38:47.158
Were you planning on telling me
that your brother is missing?

38:49.118 --> 38:51.954
I'm sorry. I guess I didn't realize
you'd be interested.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.081
Do you have any idea how it makes me look

38:54.165 --> 38:56.334
to hear that from a complete stranger

38:56.417 --> 38:57.710
in my own living room?

38:59.587 --> 39:00.504
Wendy?

39:01.922 --> 39:03.341
Wendy Marie, do you hear me?

39:04.508 --> 39:05.760
[phone bell clatters]

39:13.225 --> 39:14.477
[slider door opens]

39:14.560 --> 39:16.145
[Marty] Where the fuck are you?

39:16.729 --> 39:18.230
[Javi] I think we have a mole.

39:19.815 --> 39:20.858
What are you talking about?

39:20.941 --> 39:22.943
Remember that breakage issue we discussed?

39:23.486 --> 39:24.820
Cost of doing business?

39:25.321 --> 39:26.280
Yeah. What about it?

39:26.781 --> 39:28.824
Someone tipped the fucking FBI.

39:31.118 --> 39:32.912
That is not possible.

39:32.995 --> 39:35.206
[Javi] She was at the raid. I have proof.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.335
[sighs] Marty?

39:39.418 --> 39:41.379
Um, uh… [hesitates]

39:41.462 --> 39:42.713
You know, um…

39:43.339 --> 39:45.466
if-- if she was, you know, she--

39:45.549 --> 39:47.593
She's still-- She's part of a task force.

39:47.676 --> 39:50.012
So, you know, she can't
just refuse to do her work.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.555
That would be too suspicious.

39:51.639 --> 39:52.973
Why wouldn't she warn you?

39:54.266 --> 39:55.142
I-- I don't know.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.687
Maybe she didn't have time, or,
you know, the other agents were around.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.940
[Javi] You said you can trust her.

40:01.023 --> 40:03.359
[Marty] I can, and you know, we can.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.194
No, no, no, no, no. Don't say "we."

40:07.571 --> 40:08.989
There's no "we" right now.

40:11.325 --> 40:15.246
Hang on a sec. Are-- Are you
accusing me of being the mole?

40:15.329 --> 40:18.332
I-- I don't know where your drops are.
You know that.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.960
Which is the only reason
you're alive right now.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.754
Who else has access to her?

40:23.838 --> 40:25.381
No one but me.

40:25.464 --> 40:28.342
This is just--
This is a fucked-up coincidence.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.636
Okay? That's-- That's--
That's all this is.

40:30.719 --> 40:34.432
She got sucked up into the raid
as-- as part of the task force.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.183
They're monitoring your men.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.686
That's the only thing
that makes sense, okay?

40:38.769 --> 40:41.730
But I'm gonna-- I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it, I promise.

40:41.814 --> 40:44.984
I'm not making any more deliveries
until I know what went wrong.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.863
And tell that Nazi to go fuck himself.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.699
-[line disconnects]
-Ja-- Javi?

40:53.576 --> 40:55.494
What is it? What'd he say?

40:55.578 --> 40:56.579
He's not coming.

40:59.331 --> 41:01.000
And go fuck yourself…

41:03.085 --> 41:06.046
Wendy, we have a problem. Um…

41:06.839 --> 41:10.050
Javi ID'd, uh, Maya at the money seizure.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.345
And?

41:13.429 --> 41:15.097
And I-- I bought us a minute,

41:15.181 --> 41:20.102
but he's not going to make any more
deliveries until we find, uh, the mole.

41:21.270 --> 41:22.980
[cell phone ringing]

41:31.363 --> 41:32.448
I'll call Navarro.

41:32.531 --> 41:34.450
[Marty] I think you gotta tell Clare too.

41:37.578 --> 41:38.913
Pretty sure she knows.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.916
What the fuck are we gonna do?

41:42.416 --> 41:45.920
I dunno. But, um, just,
can you reassure her?

41:46.545 --> 41:48.923
And I'll-- I'll think of something
on the way home.

41:49.006 --> 41:49.882
Bye.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.553
-We'll fix this.
-You better.

41:55.179 --> 41:58.724
Your foundation has made a lot of
financial promises in the last week.

42:02.102 --> 42:04.230
[Navarro] You know
I can't help you, Wendy.

42:04.313 --> 42:07.525
Intervening will only raise
his suspicions, you know that.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.361
Don't tell me you're afraid of him.

42:10.444 --> 42:13.739
Wendy, is this going to be
one of those conversations, huh?

42:14.281 --> 42:16.158
Where you try to tell me my business?

42:16.242 --> 42:19.161
I just think it's time to think about
what your future looks like.

42:19.995 --> 42:21.163
And what is that?

42:21.914 --> 42:24.333
You want to be clean? Free? Clear?

42:24.416 --> 42:25.668
You want your family safe?

42:26.252 --> 42:28.045
What are you willing to sacrifice?

42:28.128 --> 42:29.964
Who are you willing to sacrifice?

42:30.047 --> 42:32.716
'Cause you'll never get that future
without giving something up.

42:36.470 --> 42:38.472
In this future you talk about…

42:40.057 --> 42:40.975
You and I…

42:42.685 --> 42:43.644
Are we friends?

42:45.396 --> 42:46.522
I don't know.

42:46.605 --> 42:48.607
[Navarro] It's nice to hear your voice.

43:14.466 --> 43:16.719
I'm not in the mood, Marty. Fuck off.

43:19.722 --> 43:21.056
Well, I, um…

43:23.726 --> 43:28.063
I wanted to say, uh, sorry if…

43:29.273 --> 43:31.317
if I was too harsh last night.

43:33.611 --> 43:34.570
Um…

43:40.618 --> 43:41.577
You okay?

43:48.667 --> 43:50.961
What did you think of me
when you first met me?

43:51.045 --> 43:52.379
[Ruth clears her throat]

43:55.549 --> 43:58.719
I, uh… I-- I thought that, um…

44:01.388 --> 44:04.016
I thought that-- that you were clever.

44:07.353 --> 44:08.812
You thought I was trash.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.027
I gave you a job, didn't I?

44:16.487 --> 44:18.280
I made you give me that job.

44:19.406 --> 44:21.617
Uh, yeah, because you were clever.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.171
God's a motherfucker.

44:35.005 --> 44:35.923
Isn't he?

44:37.841 --> 44:42.304
Built me smart enough
to know how fucked up my life is.

44:43.347 --> 44:46.517
But not quite smart enough
to haul my ass out of it.

44:50.437 --> 44:51.355
Uh…

44:53.565 --> 44:54.900
I can help with that.

44:58.821 --> 44:59.780
I, uh…

45:04.952 --> 45:07.830
I can-- I can get you a payday

45:09.331 --> 45:12.000
that'll take you wherever you want to go,

45:12.751 --> 45:14.169
if you're interested.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.464
Another Marty Byrde scheme.

45:19.466 --> 45:22.886
That would make me
a dumb fucking fuck, wouldn't it?

45:25.472 --> 45:26.432
I don't know.

45:31.103 --> 45:32.020
Well…

45:33.689 --> 45:34.606
Go on.

45:35.733 --> 45:36.692
What you got?

45:39.069 --> 45:40.612
I want to buy your product.

-[scoffs]
-Uncut, all of it.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.247
You're fucking kidding me, right?

45:50.330 --> 45:52.541
No. And I need it yesterday.

45:55.377 --> 45:57.254
You a drug dealer now, or--?

45:59.923 --> 46:00.966
It's not for me…

46:03.385 --> 46:04.428
Can we do a deal?

46:10.768 --> 46:11.727
I don't know.

46:12.936 --> 46:14.438
I'll have to think about it.

46:16.356 --> 46:18.025
I got business partners now.

46:21.195 --> 46:22.070
Okay.

46:32.539 --> 46:34.666
Why the fuck did she lie about Ben?

46:39.129 --> 46:40.297
I wish I knew.
