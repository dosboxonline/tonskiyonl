-[walkie hisses]

00:37.245 --> 00:38.830
[officer] Roger, all units hot.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.799
[suspenseful music intensifying]

00:57.390 --> 00:58.933
What happened? Did he see you?

00:59.017 --> 01:01.227
I don't think so.
We should be out of view.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.695
All right. Unit seven, take the runner.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.155
All other units, move in.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.573
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:14.157 --> 01:16.451
-[officer 1] On your left.
-[officer 2] With me.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.632
Be advised of possible hostile fire
from the cargo hold.

01:30.715 --> 01:31.800
[walkie hisses]

01:34.844 --> 01:37.388
[officer] Police. Open the door.
Drop your weapons.

01:37.472 --> 01:38.640
[device chirping]

01:38.723 --> 01:40.475
[in Spanish] Open the door. Police.

-[in English] No warm bodies.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.675
[doctor] Your heart rate
and blood pressure are stabilizing,

02:13.758 --> 02:16.302
but I'd like to test your cardiac enzymes
again this afternoon.

02:16.386 --> 02:21.141
[scoffs] All I need is to take my son
out on the land for a walk.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.270
I'm sure that he'd rather you rest up.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.609
-Thanks, Doctor.
-Mm-hmm.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.407
Don't you dare smile.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.325
[Wyatt chuckling]

02:39.409 --> 02:40.326
How's Zeke?

02:41.286 --> 02:42.203
He's good.

02:42.912 --> 02:43.997
He's with Jonah.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.249
And Ruth's there too.

02:46.916 --> 02:47.750
No.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.712
Darlene, she just wants to help.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.172
No, look at me.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.591
She is the reason that I'm here,

02:55.341 --> 02:57.677
going behind my back,
working with the Byrdes.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.930
We cannot be in business with her anymore.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.226
Uh-- She's my family. I-- I don't…

03:06.978 --> 03:08.271
I am your family.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.732
And Zeke.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.403
I don't want her in our house again.

03:17.030 --> 03:17.989
Do you hear me?

03:18.072 --> 03:19.449
Yup. I hear ya. I hear ya.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.493
[Darlene breathes deeply]

03:26.331 --> 03:27.624
[Darlene sighs]

03:28.958 --> 03:31.544
[Marty] So, we need room for what?

03:31.628 --> 03:32.837
Fifty employees,

03:32.921 --> 03:35.215
ten managers, five executives,

03:35.298 --> 03:37.717
somewhere in the 5,000 square foot range?

03:38.635 --> 03:39.469
Uh-huh.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.222
Definitely outside
The Loop, right? Like, um…

03:42.889 --> 03:44.682
West Town or Lincoln Park.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.144
-Or you know, and north facing windows--
-North facing windows. I remember.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.270
Yeah.

03:50.521 --> 03:54.150
You know, they teach
that stuff in college. Biz ad.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.902
Econ. You might like it.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.154
Dad's having me look at offices
for the foundation.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.240
Also, you know what?
Cubs make the playoffs

04:00.323 --> 04:03.368
-you might even catch a game or two.
-Ah! Don't you dare jinx them.

04:03.868 --> 04:04.702
Hey.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.454
Where's Jonah?

04:07.121 --> 04:08.039
Babysitting.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.708
I think he spent the night
at Mrs. Snell's.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.876
[phone ringing]

04:12.585 --> 04:13.920
Hey, how'd it go?

04:14.837 --> 04:17.215
I have four agents in critical condition.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.549
That's how it went.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.552
I thought we had a deal.
Why the fuck would Navarro do that?!

04:22.136 --> 04:23.263
Call Navarro.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.807
Uh… t-tell me what happened.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.933
Truck arrives on time.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.560
I call our team in. Truck explodes.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.731
The seizure got bombed.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.360
Maya, there is absolutely no way

04:37.443 --> 04:40.238
that Navarro had anything to do with this.
Do you understand?

04:40.321 --> 04:43.324
Um, he-- he needs this to work
more than anyone.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.702
The money seizure got bombed.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.039
H-Hello? Did you hear me?

04:50.623 --> 04:53.501
You are not safe right now.
If Javi suspects anything at all--

04:53.584 --> 04:55.712
I will handle my nephew, Wendy.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.006
[soccer game playing on TV]

04:58.089 --> 05:00.508
Have our friend set up
a meeting with her bosses.

05:01.217 --> 05:04.137
He targeted federal agents.
They're not gonna be willing to meet.

05:04.971 --> 05:05.888
Wendy.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.016
Now.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.562
[line disconnects]

05:17.150 --> 05:18.651
He wants to meet them right away.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.154
Uh…

05:21.237 --> 05:26.242
Um, Maya, I think that, uh,
Navarro might be ready to talk,

05:26.326 --> 05:27.618
so can we move up the deal?

05:27.702 --> 05:29.287
-Today if possible?
-The deal?

05:29.954 --> 05:33.958
There's a man getting a piece of steel
removed from his brain as we speak.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.377
Which is why we need to get this done.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.756
Just please call… call Chicago.
See if they'll hear us out, at least.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.511
-[faucet running]
-[dishes clattering]

05:48.139 --> 05:49.015
[Jonah] He's down.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.018
Only made it to number seven
on This Old Man.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.020
I don't know how you do that.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.272
I can't even figure out
his fucking sippy cup.

05:58.441 --> 06:02.070
I guess I picked up
some stuff from my parents.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.073
All I learnt from mine
was breaking and entering.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.533
[both chuckle lightly]

06:09.452 --> 06:11.412
What, uh… What happened to your mom?

06:14.123 --> 06:15.583
[smacks tongue] Uh…

06:16.959 --> 06:18.753
She was, um… [clears throat]

06:19.379 --> 06:21.964
…coming home from a late shift, and some

06:22.757 --> 06:24.008
fucker hit and ran.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.718
Probably drunk.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.637
I was eight.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.183
I'm sorry.

06:33.017 --> 06:33.935
Yeah, well…

06:36.145 --> 06:37.230
What was she like?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.485
[smacks tongue, chuckles]

06:44.404 --> 06:47.740
She used to say she liked being a Langmore

06:47.824 --> 06:49.367
because her name was Lynn.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.744
Give them H-E-double-L.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.790
Always tried to turn something bad
into something good.

07:00.962 --> 07:01.796
[Ruth] Hey.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.215
How was she?

07:04.298 --> 07:08.177
Better, still needs more tests, though.
Hey, thanks for staying here so late.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.178
Sure, anytime.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.265
I, uh… I better get to school.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.944
Uh, I… I can come by later too.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.488
No. It's all good. I got it.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.287
What's wrong?

07:36.247 --> 07:38.749
Well, she found out
you did the deal with Marty.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.586
Why do you keep fucking around with him?

07:42.086 --> 07:43.671
It was the right deal to make.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.299
I earned double
on a batch Darlene already sold.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.468
Once she has
that extra cash in her pocket,

07:48.551 --> 07:50.595
it'll be all right,
just like the last time.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.433
[Wyatt sighs]

07:55.516 --> 07:57.977
So, to what do I owe

07:58.060 --> 08:00.229
the full Wendy Byrde charm offensive?

08:01.397 --> 08:02.940
I just wanted to say thank you.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.235
And we make a pretty great team.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.196
The casino,

08:08.779 --> 08:09.822
the foundation.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.282
Uh-huh.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.659
And…

08:15.870 --> 08:18.372
I want to make this relationship official.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.167
'Cause you're old fashioned at heart.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.169
-Should I have brought my pen?
-[chuckles]

08:24.212 --> 08:25.338
Full-time job,

08:26.672 --> 08:28.674
ours exclusively, starting now.

08:30.426 --> 08:33.304
Why do I have the feeling this has
nothing to do with the foundation?

08:36.098 --> 08:39.268
Feel free to fully exercise
your attorney-client privilege.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.774
We launder money.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.402
For the Navarro Cartel.

08:55.826 --> 08:59.830
Ah, well… I knew you weren't building
casinos with tile money, but--

08:59.914 --> 09:01.249
Navarro wants out.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.336
We're about to draw up a deal with
the FBI. We want you there to oversee it.

09:06.587 --> 09:10.466
I have this, uh, rule about not doing
work that could get me killed.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.718
This will be a one-time thing.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.303
Strictly legal.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.680
Paperwork, really.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.057
They probably wouldn't
even know your name.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.643
Well, they seem to have known
your previous lawyer quite well.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.436
Helen was his lawyer.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.481
You would be ours,
solely, not the cartel's.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.732
I don't see the distinction.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.901
That's exactly
what this deal will correct.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.825
I went to Wilkes looking for a king maker,

09:36.534 --> 09:37.868
and I found you.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.495
[exhales]

09:40.246 --> 09:42.331
You're not gonna quit on me now, are you?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.587
You got a little, uh…
bullshit in your teeth.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.551
[Wendy] Hmm.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.015
[Maya] When you started all this,

09:59.765 --> 10:01.976
what'd you think the odds were
you'd end up here?

10:02.476 --> 10:03.394
[Marty] Hmm, yeah.

10:06.355 --> 10:09.525
What did you think the odds were you'd
end up on a private plane with Navarro?

10:14.113 --> 10:18.200
You know, um, there's a position for you
at the foundation after all this,

10:18.284 --> 10:20.870
um, and we do a lot of the same good,

10:20.953 --> 10:22.038
less explosions.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.083
I'm fine where I am.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.214
[Marty] Navarro had
nothing to do with the bomb.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.800
Someone inside of the cartel
is-- is setting him up.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.219
In fact, his life is in danger.
And without Navarro,

10:37.303 --> 10:39.597
everything that we have
worked for could be gone.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.141
There is no "we" here, Mr. Byrde.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.436
Your organization just targeted my agents.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.647
-As I told Agent Miller--
-[door opening]

10:49.940 --> 10:50.816
[man] Please.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.367
Uh, as I… as I was saying,
I assured Agent Miller that--

10:59.450 --> 11:01.202
I'm sure you understand,

11:01.285 --> 11:03.454
we can't act on your intel at this point.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.874
That wasn't under my control.
What's under my control

11:06.957 --> 11:08.793
is Navarro's cooperation.
I'm guaranteeing that.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.504
I'm just gonna need some assurances
for my family, all right?

11:12.880 --> 11:15.049
You're in no position to demand anything.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.635
You guys have been chasing
Navarro for over a decade,

11:17.718 --> 11:20.012
and I can deliver him to you now.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.015
Between Navarro and Lagunas,

11:23.099 --> 11:25.893
you could cripple
half of Mexico's drug trade.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.729
Prove Navarro wasn't behind the bombing,

11:29.397 --> 11:30.981
then we'll reconsider.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.362
[foreboding music playing]

11:47.248 --> 11:48.666
You gonna tell me who that was?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.085
Don't worry about him.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.920
Just give me your proof.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.935
[Wendy clears her throat]

12:14.150 --> 12:16.068
You come here to finish me off?

12:17.445 --> 12:19.029
Oh, please.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.866
I saved your life, Darlene.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.076
[Darlene] You didn't want to.

12:24.827 --> 12:25.786
I saw.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.668
Why are you here?

12:34.128 --> 12:36.422
-I want you to let Jonah go.
-[scoffs]

12:37.631 --> 12:38.924
And why should I do that?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.220
Look where you are, Darlene.

12:44.638 --> 12:48.350
Just a mention
of Ruth's deal with Marty, and…

12:49.602 --> 12:52.229
Wyatt's friendship with Charlotte
put you in the hospital.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.149
Now, are you sure you want
another Byrde in your life?

12:56.275 --> 12:57.610
The way I see it,

12:57.693 --> 12:59.236
he isn't a Byrde anymore.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.032
He never would have gave Zeke away.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.869
Someone who loves Zeke
as much as Jonah does,

13:07.828 --> 13:10.539
he can stay with me
as long as he wants to.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.045
We took your land for our casino.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.423
We gave your heroin to our partners.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.425
We can take everything else you have.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.093
Now, are you prepared for that?

13:24.678 --> 13:25.721
In your condition?

13:28.641 --> 13:29.683
Let him go.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.814
I am as strong as a bull.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.861
[laughing] You just had a heart attack.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.738
My husband had a heart attack.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.032
I lost my breath is all.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.867
[knocking on door]

13:50.871 --> 13:51.914
Oh.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.417
Look after this one.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.754
She's still a bit delicate.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.679
[line ringing]

14:08.389 --> 14:09.765
[Omar] What is it, Marty?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.267
We need to give them Javi.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.811
Tell them just showing my face
should be enough,

14:13.894 --> 14:16.146
and if they want
any piece of what I have to offer,

14:16.230 --> 14:18.023
to start showing some respect, Marty.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.360
Well, that-- that's not enough.
We need proof that this wasn't--

14:22.069 --> 14:23.779
[line disconnecting]

14:23.863 --> 14:24.780
Fuck.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.409
[in Spanish] Can I have a minute, Father?

14:29.159 --> 14:30.536
Javi. Come.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.246
[Javi] Coming.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.168
-[Omar] The cash shipment, was it you?
-[Javi sighs]

14:38.252 --> 14:41.422
Don't look at them, look at me.
Don't play dumb, was it you?

14:41.505 --> 14:44.133
[Javi] I just made
an educated guess. That's it.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.052
You almost killed four Feds on US soil.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.470
But I was right, wasn't I?

14:49.930 --> 14:52.057
Someone is fucking us.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.812
Tell me why you did it.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.817
Because I wanted to know
who is fucking with us.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.193
Who was snitching on us.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.072
Listen, it was worth
the risk of angering the FBI.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.285
If someone betrays our family,
our blood, we have nothing.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.246
[chuckles]

15:14.330 --> 15:15.748
I would've done the same.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.462
These are the kinds of decisions
you'll need to make, Javi.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.922
And they're not easy.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.259
What are you saying?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.889
It's your turn, nephew.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.268
It's time for your generation
to take over and…

15:37.394 --> 15:38.979
and you should be their leader.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.654
Are you okay? Is something going on?

15:46.737 --> 15:47.863
-Can I help--
-No.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.450
I've never been better, Javi.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.747
I'll spend more time with my kids.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.415
Yes.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.541
[dogs barking]

15:59.625 --> 16:01.126
With my dogs. [chuckles]

16:02.878 --> 16:06.632
-The Byrdes built me a fortune and--
-No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.343
The Byrdes are not trustworthy.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.263
Marty's agent was at the bust,

16:13.347 --> 16:15.599
and that fucking hillbilly
is still operating.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.727
Yes, I know. This is why
I'm getting my assets out now

16:18.811 --> 16:20.437
and passing the torch to you.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.148
While I still can.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.152
And after that?

16:28.028 --> 16:28.862
After that?

16:28.946 --> 16:32.324
-Yes. What happens after that?
-[snickering]

16:33.283 --> 16:35.786
And after that, the Byrdes are yours.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.338
[Omar chuckling]

16:52.136 --> 16:53.554
Blood over everything.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.682
Blood over everything.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.270
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.158
[footsteps approaching]

17:14.241 --> 17:15.242
[door shuts]

17:22.291 --> 17:24.209
I know it's not the deal
you would've made,

17:24.293 --> 17:26.253
but it's still good for us,

17:26.336 --> 17:27.296
partner wise.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.549
Where's my son?

17:30.632 --> 17:31.508
Ruth?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.510
[Darlene sighs]

17:33.594 --> 17:34.428
Ruth.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.017
Don't do this, Wy.

17:40.601 --> 17:44.021
Ruth, she just got back from the hospital.
She needs some fucking time.

17:44.104 --> 17:46.690
If you don't stand up to her now,
she'll shut me out forever.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.108
I would not let that happen.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.860
Let's just go. You, me, and Three.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.821
We got more money than we know
what to do with. We can go anywhere.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.490
-And do what?
-I don't know.

17:54.573 --> 17:58.577
You can still go back to college and get
your degree or whatever the fuck you want.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.870
We're not our daddies.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.164
We can get out of this fucking place.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.916
Do you think that I don't know that?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.543
Do you think that I slept
out on that trailer

18:06.627 --> 18:08.921
because I wanted to stay here
for the rest of my life?

18:09.546 --> 18:10.756
Then come with me.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.843
It's not that simple anymore.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.305
I know it sounds fucking crazy, but…

18:18.847 --> 18:20.599
but Darlene and Zeke and I,

18:21.308 --> 18:22.226
we're a family.

18:22.726 --> 18:23.977
[Ruth scoffs]

18:24.061 --> 18:25.020
I'm your family.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.689
You don't have to stay.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.234
I want you to be happy too.

18:32.152 --> 18:35.155
[scoffs] I got nowhere else to fucking go.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.657
You're all I got.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.827
We just need some time, okay?
Everything's going to be okay. I promise.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.036
[Wyatt groans]

18:41.745 --> 18:42.871
[door shuts]

18:50.045 --> 18:51.839
[birds tweeting]

18:51.922 --> 18:55.342
[Charlotte] Aberdeen has more units
with thermochromic windows,

18:55.926 --> 18:58.095
but Clark has bigger windows, but that's…

18:58.720 --> 18:59.805
bad for energy,

18:59.888 --> 19:02.015
uh, but more suites if you want to expand.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.102
Why don't we just concentrate
on our classes for today, okay?

19:05.185 --> 19:07.479
And buddy, did you not have
enough time yesterday

19:07.563 --> 19:08.897
to finish your homework?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.983
Or have you moved on to someone else's?

19:14.403 --> 19:15.362
Is that what that is?

19:15.863 --> 19:16.864
Some extra scratch?

19:16.947 --> 19:18.532
I'm not moving back to Chicago.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.951
Oh, but you are.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.077
Yeah, your mom's right.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.872
You should start thinking about
closing up shop. Okay?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.750
And you'll babysit for Darlene Snell
over my dead body.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.796
Um… yeah. Thank you. Off to school.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.923
Go learn some things, and, um…

19:35.007 --> 19:38.635
it's family dinner tonight. Okay?
Don't be late. Mom's making her chicken.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.137
I think I have school stuff.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.890
In case I still feel
like going to college.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.766
[phone buzzing]

19:44.850 --> 19:46.018
Okay.

19:51.773 --> 19:52.608
Hello?

19:57.946 --> 19:59.114
Yes, I'm his sister.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.075
[car engine turns over]

20:04.661 --> 20:07.581
Oh God. Yes.
That-- that fits his description.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.002
Paducah? Um…

20:13.170 --> 20:15.297
Yes, I-- I can be there in a couple hours.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.841
All right. Thank-- Thank you.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.052
[phone beeps off]

20:25.057 --> 20:27.559
There's a dead man in Paducah
that looks like Ben.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.564
I have to go.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.609
It's not him.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.658
Obviously.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.568
Good morning.

21:19.861 --> 21:20.904
Hola, Marty.

21:20.988 --> 21:21.822
[Marty] Hi.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.950
What-- What brings you to town?

21:26.201 --> 21:28.912
Don't know if you heard,
but my uncle is stepping down.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.124
[smacks tongue] I'm your new boss.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.584
[sighs in contentment]

21:38.797 --> 21:39.756
Congratulations.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.385
I thought I should come
have a look at our finances.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.804
Yeah, okay.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.139
Mm-hmm. Yeah, good.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.182
Let's, uh… Let's-- Let's do that.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.186
I want to think like a tech giant.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.189
We provide services that power the world.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.441
We should act like it.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.572
[smacks tongue] Completely agree. Um…

22:03.655 --> 22:07.617
Uh, you know, the… the--
The other casino, though,

22:07.701 --> 22:10.495
uh, it's kind of a dump, honestly,

22:10.579 --> 22:12.122
uh, and the-- and the hotel,

22:12.205 --> 22:13.498
uh, The Big Muddy…

22:13.582 --> 22:16.001
[inhales sharply]
…those are your uncle's, um,

22:16.084 --> 22:17.461
and the horse farm,

22:17.544 --> 22:18.962
you know, they're all clean.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.630
Those are about to go away?

22:20.714 --> 22:21.840
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.

22:21.923 --> 22:26.136
Technically they were never really part
of the organization to begin with, so um--

22:26.219 --> 22:28.263
Right. Right, right, right. Technically.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.724
Yeah, but-- but this… this-- this casino,

22:30.807 --> 22:33.185
The-- The Belle? She's-- She's all yours.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.686
And the strip club.

22:36.813 --> 22:40.859
Great little gentlemen's club,
Lickety Splitz, does quite well, actually.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.694
Uh, they are yours,

22:42.778 --> 22:45.364
uh, and the funeral home, of course.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.034
We should find you larger accounts.

22:49.868 --> 22:50.786
Up your game.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.580
Euros. Baht.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.832
Patacas.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.461
That could be great.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.712
[chuckles]

23:02.089 --> 23:05.342
America's done anyway.
Just a street market now, really.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.470
-[Marty] Hmm.
-Big pharma included.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.722
Just ask Clare.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.728
We could move you to Macau.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.857
Those casinos were built to clean cash.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.322
I hear that it's beautiful.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.200
Otherwise, what's the point?

23:30.283 --> 23:31.243
[Marty] Mm-hmm.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.078
[Javi chuckles]

23:33.578 --> 23:34.538
[smacks tongue]

23:37.124 --> 23:39.167
How's that agent of yours doing anyway?

23:41.086 --> 23:42.546
She's fine.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.047
Uh, I think. I don't know.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.049
I haven't talked to her
in quite some time.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.092
I haven't needed to.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.679
Still confident she's loyal?

23:50.762 --> 23:51.638
Oh, yeah.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.974
Yeah. Yeah, very, very.
I, you know, I told you,

23:54.057 --> 23:57.018
I vetted that whole
cash seizure situation,

23:57.853 --> 24:00.647
and, uh, and… she's ours.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.734
You'll have to put us in touch.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.406
She still will only talk to me.

24:09.489 --> 24:10.657
[Javi scoffs]

24:12.534 --> 24:13.869
That will have to change.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.457
Especially if you're in Macau.

24:20.375 --> 24:23.962
[suspenseful music pulsating]

24:45.901 --> 24:46.985
[sighs]

24:48.195 --> 24:52.073
Yeah, hey, your, uh, nephew
just showed up to brainstorm

24:52.157 --> 24:55.577
when would be a great time
to kill me and my family.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.412
You said you were gonna take care of him,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.706
not give him the keys
to the fucking cartel.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.044
Is he happy with everything, Marty?

25:05.295 --> 25:07.797
The numbers? Yeah, they're great.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.425
I mean, but you know, he--
he can tell something's off.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.343
Yeah, well.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.054
Tell them they can have it all.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.726
The money, the routes, and the leadership.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.687
"Them"? The FBI?

25:23.313 --> 25:24.147
[Omar] Sí.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.734
Great. Good. Uh…

25:28.235 --> 25:31.363
Good, uh, this-- this includes
your nephew, right?

25:33.365 --> 25:35.033
Seems like a pretty good move. No?

25:35.116 --> 25:36.368
Yes, it does.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.827
Uh, but you know, I still--

25:37.911 --> 25:40.372
I need to get the proof
that he did the bombing.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.708
Well he is in the Ozarks, isn't he?

25:45.585 --> 25:47.128
Then go find it, Marty.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.674
[line disconnects]

25:53.385 --> 25:55.637
I told you not to work
for my parents anymore.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.349
[scoffs] Now you're piling on too?

26:00.350 --> 26:01.393
Pfft. Jesus.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.604
Sorry, I didn't--
I didn't mean it like that.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.857
It just never goes well
for their partners.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.110
Or family.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.696
Or anyone really. [sniffs]

26:15.991 --> 26:16.825
Thanks.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.203
So what are you gonna do now?

26:23.999 --> 26:25.250
Don't know. [chuckles]

26:28.253 --> 26:30.630
But you can keep cleaning for Darlene.

26:30.714 --> 26:31.631
She'd love it.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.675
Just to fuck with your mom.

26:35.927 --> 26:39.556
I don't-- I don't… think it feels right
working without you.

26:40.056 --> 26:42.642
Oh. Don't worry about me.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.520
You keep doing it
for as long as you want. Okay?

26:48.398 --> 26:49.858
I'll go wherever you need me.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.821
-[thuds]
-Ow.

26:54.904 --> 26:55.989
-[crow cawing]
-Here.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.825
[Jonah chuckling]

26:59.826 --> 27:00.827
Do it like this.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.245
All right…

27:02.329 --> 27:03.663
[bottle cap clinking]

27:03.747 --> 27:06.041
Stick to money laundering. Okay?

27:07.500 --> 27:09.502
[fluorescent lights humming]

27:35.904 --> 27:36.946
Well, drive safe.

27:41.951 --> 27:42.869
Fuck.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.458
You want to get a cup of coffee?

27:52.504 --> 27:54.047
[Wendy] Charlotte's a senior.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.257
She's going straight into business. She's…

27:57.425 --> 27:59.511
working for us, actually, doing great,

27:59.594 --> 28:00.512
and Jonah…

28:02.055 --> 28:03.848
has a tiny rebellious streak.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.518
[chuckling] Go figure.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.145
He's so entrepreneurial.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.649
Started his own company.
Several, actually.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.612
Casinos and nudie bars. Right?

28:18.655 --> 28:19.906
How's all that going?

28:22.575 --> 28:23.410
Great.

28:24.285 --> 28:27.747
No, our nonprofit just broke ground
on a new health facility.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.375
We're moving back to Chicago to keep up.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.963
Nice to sit with you anyway.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.508
[chuckles] Wasn't sure
you were still capable of it.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.011
It was good of you to drive all this way.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.098
Well, the church thought
it was important that I come.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.560
The church.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.312
Makes sense.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.565
Your son's body shows up,

28:53.648 --> 28:56.359
but check with the congregation
to make sure it's worth the drive.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.820
It wasn't him, though, was it?

29:00.613 --> 29:03.616
Pastor Wells still your drinking buddy,
or did he finally kill himself?

29:04.242 --> 29:06.119
[sarcastic] Oh, he's well, thanks.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.082
I see why Ben went missing.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.211
Locking him up like that.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.464
[scoffs]

29:18.298 --> 29:20.717
You never did understand
the world doesn't revolve around you.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.137
You made that abundantly clear.

29:24.220 --> 29:27.932
I tried putting sense into you,
is what I did, and you abandoned us.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.727
I don't remember
you ever trying to stop me.

29:30.810 --> 29:33.813
-What was I supposed to do?
-I don't know. Anything?

29:35.231 --> 29:36.232
[grunts]

29:36.816 --> 29:37.692
Yeah.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.361
It was quieter with you gone.

29:49.120 --> 29:49.996
You know…

29:50.789 --> 29:51.664
don't worry.

29:52.707 --> 29:55.960
I'm sure the church will think
you're an awesome father.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.215
[Nathan] Drive safe.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.387
Fucking junkies

30:07.180 --> 30:08.890
and ATV cowboys.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.936
Do you know how easy it is
for those low-lives to rat us out?

30:14.395 --> 30:16.940
Don't ever go behind
the family's back again.

30:17.023 --> 30:20.443
What fucking family? You put me on ice
since I've been out of the hospital.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.612
The fucking captains
go right over my head now.

30:22.695 --> 30:23.571
You know why?

30:23.655 --> 30:25.198
Because when I say that Snell woman

30:25.281 --> 30:27.116
and her business
aren't good enough for us,

30:27.200 --> 30:28.827
everybody listens except you.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.411
I cleared seven figures.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.121
Is that not good enough for you?

30:32.205 --> 30:35.458
From what I heard,
Little Orphan Annie did all the hard work.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.001
That was my deal.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.002
I got it done.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.213
Nothing's yours.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.715
Then give me something.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.175
You're my boy.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.386
That not enough for you?

30:48.513 --> 30:49.931
I'm a 40-year-old man.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.933
Fuck the captains.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.601
Fuck you.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.115
[keypad beeping]

31:08.700 --> 31:10.118
[line ringing]

31:12.161 --> 31:13.663
[phone buzzing]

31:14.998 --> 31:15.874
[grunts]

31:16.416 --> 31:17.292
You get word?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.044
[Wendy] No. Hey, listen, I'm curious.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.924
If a minor gets hit with
a federal money laundering charge,

31:25.800 --> 31:26.759
what happens?

31:27.969 --> 31:30.513
[Jim] Um, this Mike Fleming
we're talking about?

31:33.850 --> 31:34.976
How bad would that be?

31:36.269 --> 31:37.186
Well, um…

31:38.479 --> 31:40.773
juvie, probation, service,

31:41.691 --> 31:44.360
might make the news because it's weird,

31:44.444 --> 31:45.904
but we could try to suppress it.

31:47.947 --> 31:50.408
So we could have it wiped
when he turns 18, right?

31:51.367 --> 31:53.786
Um, Wendy, nothing is ever really wiped,

31:53.870 --> 31:55.038
but sure.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.874
My DOJ people, your feds.

31:58.625 --> 32:03.129
Mike Fleming does a lot better than your
average teenage white-collar criminal.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.175
Now might this better be discussed

32:07.842 --> 32:09.344
with a family therapist?

32:09.886 --> 32:13.556
[chuckles]
Welcome to being the family lawyer.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.021
I see that you took my request to heart.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.941
Yeah, uh, so that yeah, that's just it.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.859
I was thinking about, uh, you know,

32:24.943 --> 32:27.070
modernizing the cartel.

32:28.112 --> 32:28.988
Beer?

32:29.072 --> 32:32.492
Um, I was thinking about, uh,
consolidating, uh, while…

32:33.034 --> 32:35.828
expanding, as-- as you were saying. Uh…

32:35.912 --> 32:38.414
For instance, that, uh…

32:39.165 --> 32:41.626
that seizure bombing that you did,

32:42.502 --> 32:44.504
it was all over the news, you know, the…

32:45.171 --> 32:47.632
the truck, the location,
seemed like your style.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.010
What the fuck do you know about my style?

32:53.638 --> 32:56.557
I-- I just… I just--
I just know that it was brilliant.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.227
You know, catching their hand
in the jar like that.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.187
Can we get him any louder?

33:01.688 --> 33:03.356
[Marty] Uh, my-- my thought is

33:04.399 --> 33:05.525
do it again, but…

33:06.150 --> 33:07.402
cap your burn.

33:07.485 --> 33:11.572
You know, and… trucks and drivers,
those are very cheap to scale.

33:11.656 --> 33:15.368
So why put so much risk on a single trip,

33:15.451 --> 33:18.371
you know, double the trucks,
slash your payloads.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.958
I mean, sure, you know,
a lot more get caught-- Breakage.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.544
But many, many more will get through.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.796
Uh, like tech,

33:27.422 --> 33:29.632
break big, win big.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.971
[Javi] This doesn't exactly fall
under your purview.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.223
[Marty] Best idea wins?

33:37.306 --> 33:38.391
Uh, and…

33:39.976 --> 33:40.977
your uncle

33:41.602 --> 33:43.271
never would have hit the feds

33:43.896 --> 33:44.897
like that.

33:45.398 --> 33:46.232
Hmm?

33:48.860 --> 33:49.861
It made sense.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.948
Someone has to keep those fucks in check.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.370
Next time, just do it cheaper. Right?

34:04.542 --> 34:05.918
Send that to Chicago.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.301
[heavy pounding on door]

34:13.384 --> 34:14.302
It's open!

34:14.385 --> 34:15.887
[door opens]

34:15.970 --> 34:19.724
[Frank Sr] You think you can fuck me
with the heroin, the rehabs,

34:19.807 --> 34:22.393
and now you can go
behind my back to my son?

34:23.269 --> 34:26.856
You're gonna settle up that 500 grand
for those rehabs right fucking now,

34:27.356 --> 34:30.401
and every goddamn cent
my boy paid for your dope

34:30.485 --> 34:31.861
you're giving back to me.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.656
And then you can stay the fuck away
and stick with fucking up your own kid.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.661
What kind of a mother packs
her kid's car seat full of heroin?

34:41.454 --> 34:44.791
Who the fuck did you have to con
into giving you a baby?

34:44.874 --> 34:46.417
[shouting] Are you hearing me?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.795
I will burn this place

34:48.878 --> 34:51.839
and every unholy son of a bitch inside--

34:51.923 --> 34:53.466
-[gun blast]
-[thuds]

34:54.801 --> 34:57.637
[Zeke wailing]

35:02.767 --> 35:03.976
[Darlene sighs]

35:08.898 --> 35:12.026
[soft rock playing on stereo]

35:21.285 --> 35:22.411
[under breath] Wendy.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.501
-Sam.
-Wendy.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.545
Sam, it is so good to see you.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.421
Wish I could say the same.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.424
Oh, come on. You don't mean that.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.136
You kicked me out of the Belle.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.887
Exactly, for your own good.

35:40.513 --> 35:43.474
And now look at you.
Look, you've landed this great new job.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.268
Worked out better than I'd hoped.

35:47.436 --> 35:49.814
Oh, I bet Ruth is so happy you're here.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.358
Well…

35:52.900 --> 35:55.778
she said she missed seeing me
around Lickety Splitz, so…

35:55.862 --> 35:57.530
Of course she said that.

35:58.656 --> 36:01.492
Hey Sam, I'm wondering
if you could do me a favor.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.703
Um, Jonah left some school work here.

36:03.786 --> 36:05.454
It's a very important project.

36:07.456 --> 36:10.334
That would be a violation
of our guest policy.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.796
You're in the hospitality business.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.466
Would it be hospitable
to turn away a guest's mother?

36:21.971 --> 36:24.056
You know, I really should
get his permission.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.893
Oh. Oh, right, right. Of course.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.686
Though he's not really a guest,

36:29.187 --> 36:30.313
and you are the manager.

36:30.813 --> 36:31.981
This is your place.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.153
Huh.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.238
[chuckling]

36:40.114 --> 36:42.617
[chuckling] Okay. Okay.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.996
-One time.
-Okay.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.695
[computer buzzing]

37:26.118 --> 37:27.828
[buzzing]

37:31.832 --> 37:33.834
[ominous music plays]

38:12.665 --> 38:14.583
[camera clicking]

38:16.252 --> 38:17.628
[Sam] Got everything you need?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.005
I sure did.

38:19.672 --> 38:20.589
And, uh…

38:21.674 --> 38:23.551
maybe don't mention this to Jonah.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.387
He just, he gets so embarrassed
when Mom has to help.

38:26.470 --> 38:27.346
[chuckles]

38:27.972 --> 38:29.432
Teenagers, am I right? [chuckles]

38:29.515 --> 38:30.516
[Wendy] Teenagers.

38:32.518 --> 38:33.436
[car door shuts]

38:39.442 --> 38:40.443
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:44.613 --> 38:46.073
Who-- Who is that?

38:46.699 --> 38:48.826
That was Frank Cosgrove, Senior.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.621
What the fuck did you do?

38:52.705 --> 38:54.040
He was threatening us.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.209
And he was unkind.

39:00.087 --> 39:01.297
I-- I need some air.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.098
[bugs chirring]

39:14.685 --> 39:16.687
[Wyatt panting]

39:18.314 --> 39:19.231
Are you okay?

39:20.107 --> 39:22.568
[voice quavering]
She killed Frank Junior's Dad.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.528
What the fuck?

39:25.946 --> 39:27.656
[Wyatt sniffling]

39:28.282 --> 39:30.242
Were you serious about leaving?

39:30.826 --> 39:34.455
Let's get the biggest boat at Hurn's
and we take it up the Missouri.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.957
Me, you, and Three
and we just keep fucking going.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.668
[Wyatt sighs]

39:41.670 --> 39:44.423
All right, but g-go where?
Do what? Like, what?

39:44.507 --> 39:45.383
[Ruth] I don't know.

39:46.092 --> 39:49.595
Honestly, just… as far away
from here as fucking possible.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.725
[sniffling] Okay.

39:56.435 --> 39:57.269
Yeah.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.189
Okay.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.276
Okay.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.820
[doorbell chimes]

40:06.445 --> 40:08.447
[dog barking]

40:13.160 --> 40:14.120
Hi.

40:14.203 --> 40:16.705
Hi. I'm looking for Mr. James Rettelsdorf.

40:17.331 --> 40:18.207
You found him.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.460
Oh. Wonderful.

40:21.544 --> 40:22.878
[both chuckle]

40:22.962 --> 40:24.713
Uh, I wanted to introduce myself.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.841
Javier Emilio Elizondro Navarro.

40:27.883 --> 40:29.135
Omar Navarro's successor.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.178
You'll be working for me now.

40:33.055 --> 40:35.975
I was very tight with
the Byrdes' last lawyer, Helen Pierce.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.601
Oh, great woman.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.521
I want to open
that line of communication again.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.982
Everything the Byrdes know, I know.

40:43.691 --> 40:44.525
Easy.

40:45.651 --> 40:47.778
Oh, there may be some confusion here.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.655
It sounds like Helen was your lawyer.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.115
I'm the Byrdes'.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.244
It's amazing how this country works.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.329
One big LLC.

40:58.914 --> 41:00.833
In Mexico it's like one big family.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.043
I appreciate family,

41:03.752 --> 41:04.962
very deeply,

41:06.338 --> 41:07.882
but as a lawyer…

41:07.965 --> 41:10.968
uh, representing the employer of a client,

41:12.344 --> 41:13.721
that's a conflict of interest.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.765
You seem like a smart man.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.561
I think you'll figure out
what's in your best interest.

41:20.644 --> 41:21.562
[dog barking]

41:21.645 --> 41:22.771
Well, uh…

41:24.648 --> 41:26.150
[tense music playing]

41:26.233 --> 41:27.943
…nothing to report right now,

41:28.569 --> 41:30.571
but if you'd like to leave me your card.

41:32.656 --> 41:33.657
Call anytime.

41:34.992 --> 41:35.826
Every time.

41:40.998 --> 41:44.043
[in Spanish] Look at that.
What a beautiful thing.

41:47.588 --> 41:48.839
[in English] Beautiful dog.

41:53.552 --> 41:54.803
[Wendy] Yes. Hey, Nancy?

41:54.887 --> 41:56.472
-[Nancy] Hi. Yes?
-[Wendy] Hi.

41:56.555 --> 41:59.975
I-- I'm-- I'm calling about
a Miss Darlene Snell.

42:00.559 --> 42:03.395
She's a-- a foster mother
in your jurisdiction,

42:03.479 --> 42:05.314
and she's a widow and she just--

42:14.990 --> 42:16.617
It's so, so sad.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.538
Well, that's just it.
Just a couple of local kids that I'd…

42:21.163 --> 42:23.916
hardly call professional childcare.
[chuckles]

42:25.125 --> 42:26.710
Oh, no, I'd-- I'd be mortified

42:27.211 --> 42:29.421
if she knew that I'd called. [groans]

42:29.505 --> 42:32.341
Maybe you could just--
just check in on her.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.135
Great.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.179
Oh, great, Nancy. Thank you.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.160
Oh, he'll live with us.

44:23.994 --> 44:26.288
I mean, I guess he could live with you.

45:18.799 --> 45:20.509
[Jonah] No, I can't. He'll kill me.

45:20.592 --> 45:22.136
Yeah, well, maybe worry about that

45:22.219 --> 45:24.722
after you keep yourself
out of federal fucking prison.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.057
[Ruth] Look. Listen to me.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.268
The same thing
happened to me at the Belle.

45:29.768 --> 45:30.853
He can fix this.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.980
He doesn't want me doing this.

45:58.547 --> 46:01.008
I'm gonna need all
your account numbers and passwords

46:10.476 --> 46:11.310
Sorry.

46:11.393 --> 46:14.521
Um… now, was there
any spike in the deposits,

46:14.605 --> 46:17.858
uh, or did you, uh…
did you-- did you repeat an account

46:17.941 --> 46:19.526
in the transfer chain?

46:20.027 --> 46:20.861
No.

46:20.944 --> 46:22.488
No, I-- I wouldn't do that.

46:22.571 --> 46:24.990
Okay, I mean, you didn't designate

46:25.574 --> 46:27.993
too many trustees from, uh,

46:28.076 --> 46:29.787

[sighs] I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know!

46:32.372 --> 46:34.541
Um, I don't-- I don't think so. Can I--

46:34.625 --> 46:36.919
-[shakily] Can I go to prison for that?
-[mouse clicking]

-Calm down.

Okay, first things first,

46:45.052 --> 46:47.554
we're going to terminate
the scheduled transfers,

46:47.638 --> 46:50.390

slide the assets over

…no trace.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.078

Um… I-- I don't know. I don't know.

47:43.485 --> 47:45.404
There's-- There's lots
of watch dogs out there.

You know, it's probably just some
overzealous FDIC regulator,

47:49.283 --> 47:51.618

We're closing the account.

48:02.254 --> 48:04.715

some dinner at the house.

48:04.798 --> 48:06.008
We would all love that.

48:07.718 --> 48:08.719
What do you think?

48:12.514 --> 48:13.849
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah?

48:16.768 --> 48:17.686
Um, I-- I should--

48:17.769 --> 48:21.189
I should-- I should re-encrypt
my server and backup drives, right?

48:21.273 --> 48:23.025
-Just to be safe.
-That's fine.

48:24.776 --> 48:25.611

is also what scares me.

You're so…

48:45.255 --> 48:46.757
strong, and…

48:47.883 --> 48:50.844
so brave and… proud, and…

48:51.929 --> 48:54.097
I realize that I'm none of those things,

48:55.182 --> 48:56.308

[Marty] I'll set the table.

56:41.272 --> 56:42.273
How was your day?

56:42.357 --> 56:44.067
[pounding lightly]

56:44.150 --> 56:46.486
Day was fine. Just waiting on the, uh…

56:47.028 --> 56:49.197
response from the FBI. How was the morgue?

56:50.240 --> 56:51.116
Fine.

56:51.199 --> 56:52.909
[pan sizzling]

56:52.992 --> 56:53.993
It wasn't him.

56:54.953 --> 56:56.329
[door shuts]

56:56.996 --> 56:57.831
Hi.

56:58.331 --> 57:00.708
Ah. I knew you couldn't resist my cutlets.

57:00.792 --> 57:02.168
It was you, wasn't it?

57:04.879 --> 57:06.172
What are you talking about?

57:06.256 --> 57:08.258
You planted the red flag on my account.

57:13.138 --> 57:16.141
-Jonah, this is an important lesson.
-I could have gone to jail!

57:16.224 --> 57:17.434
Jesus Christ, Wendy.

57:18.351 --> 57:20.311
You don't give a shit what happens to me.

57:20.395 --> 57:22.981
All I think about is what happens to you.

57:23.064 --> 57:25.066
-If you need help--
-Dad already fixed it.

57:27.819 --> 57:29.362
Jonah. Hey.

57:30.864 --> 57:31.948
Hey, Jonah?

57:37.328 --> 57:39.330
Have you lost your fucking mind, Wendy?

57:40.415 --> 57:44.085
He told Darlene
that he saw us with Nix's body.

57:44.627 --> 57:47.380
This is not some aimless teen rebellion.

57:47.464 --> 57:50.550
And you thought-- you thought
arresting him might help.

57:51.134 --> 57:54.762
I mean, you can't throw a kid
into a burning building, Wendy,

57:54.846 --> 57:57.682
and watch him running back
into your arms and pretend it's love.

57:57.765 --> 57:59.642
-But what did he do, Marty, huh?
-Please.

57:59.726 --> 58:00.977
He came running right to ya!

58:01.060 --> 58:03.396
And while you get to play
fucking father of the year--

58:03.480 --> 58:05.857
Which by the way,
where's the united front on that, huh?

58:05.940 --> 58:09.360
[scoffs] "United"?
You tried to send our kid to jail.

58:09.444 --> 58:13.239
We both know he would not do
a minute of jail time.

58:14.240 --> 58:15.617
I am trying

58:16.493 --> 58:18.328
to keep this family, a family.

58:18.828 --> 58:21.206
Is this the family
you want him to return to?

58:21.289 --> 58:23.791
Because I'll tell you what,
I'm not going to fucking stand by

58:23.875 --> 58:27.337
and watch you try to turn our children
into one of your goddamn conquests.

58:27.420 --> 58:29.964
In fact, when we get back
to Chicago, Wendy,

58:30.048 --> 58:31.716
when we get back to that town,

58:31.799 --> 58:32.842
-you and I--
-What?

58:33.426 --> 58:35.345
What do you think's
waiting for you there, huh?

58:35.428 --> 58:36.262
Our old life?

58:36.804 --> 58:38.640
Because that was a big fucking lie.

58:40.475 --> 58:42.227
[phone ringing]

58:42.310 --> 58:44.103
[resumes pounding]

58:48.608 --> 58:49.943
I don't care, Wendy.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.280
I just want our kids out of this. Okay?

58:54.989 --> 58:55.823
Hello?

59:00.370 --> 59:03.373
[bugs chirring]

59:10.213 --> 59:13.508
Jesus, how could she do that?

59:14.509 --> 59:15.510
Well, it's Mom.

59:17.845 --> 59:21.975
Jonah… I know things
have gotten really messed up, but…

59:22.934 --> 59:24.936
you're coming to Chicago, right? I mean…

59:25.562 --> 59:26.563
You have to.

59:35.154 --> 59:37.699
Yeah. Yeah, no, I-- I understand.

59:38.992 --> 59:39.909
Uh, thank you.

59:41.077 --> 59:41.911
Bye.

59:44.163 --> 59:49.419
Uh, we are delivering Omar Navarro
to the FBI in 12 hours.

59:50.044 --> 59:52.338
[Marty sighs]

59:57.010 --> 59:57.927
Jonah's gone.

1:00:11.858 --> 1:00:15.820
[ominous music playing]
