17:16.577 --> 17:19.371
…was it the department's idea
to make the change,

17:19.455 --> 17:22.833
or did you think it'd be a good idea
to get someone local in the position

17:22.916 --> 17:24.251
before the election?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.925
How may I be of service, Mrs. Byrde?

17:34.636 --> 17:36.638
Well… [laughs]

Well, I-I was just wondering
if you'd be willing to take a chance

17:41.477 --> 17:43.604
and stop a crime before it happened.

17:45.647 --> 17:49.860
To be honest, right now I'm more
interested in what you're not saying

17:49.943 --> 17:51.445
in between the words.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.408
You know sheriff is a political position.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.161
[Ronnie] Meaning what?

18:01.497 --> 18:03.207
You called yourself "deputy."

18:03.999 --> 18:06.835
You're not. You're "acting sheriff."

18:08.337 --> 18:11.298
Act the part right,
the right people notice.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.053
[Ronnie] What time are you expecting her?

18:16.136 --> 18:18.180
Ruth doesn't exactly keep hours. Uh…

18:18.764 --> 18:20.349
I could tell her you came by.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.435
Didn't you used to run Lickety Splitz?

18:24.394 --> 18:25.979
Since when do you run this place?

18:26.563 --> 18:29.483
I had some female
conflicts of interest, so…

18:29.566 --> 18:33.237
[inhales] Ruth thought
this would be a better fit.

18:33.904 --> 18:37.199
So you just do
whatever Ruth Langmore tells you to do?

18:37.908 --> 18:39.409
Pretty much. [chuckles]

18:42.746 --> 18:46.041
I mean, no. No, sir.
See, I had this fiancée--

18:46.125 --> 18:48.252
I heard Ruth did business
with Darlene Snell.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.920
Now, what do you know about that?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.925
I just check in guests
and handle the maid service.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.969
You handle the financials?

18:57.553 --> 18:58.387
No, sir.

But you can speak to our bookkeeper.

And your mom knows all this?

19:56.862 --> 19:59.031
I need to ask you a few questions.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.199
Do you have a warrant?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.701
Do I need one to ask you a question?

20:03.535 --> 20:06.121
[chuckles] Uh, I guess not.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.498
[Ronnie chuckles] No, okay.

20:09.458 --> 20:14.213
Exactly what kind of accounting
do you do for Ruth Langmore?

20:15.047 --> 20:20.510
Oh, I handle cash flow,
bank transfers, online stuff like that.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.932
How much a place like this
pull down a year?

20:26.099 --> 20:28.393
I only, like, just started working here.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.312
Nah, if you had to guess.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.271
I wouldn't.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.358
[Ronnie] Uh-huh.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.070
Hey.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.531
You ever do any bookkeeping
for Darlene Snell?

20:45.410 --> 20:46.995
You know who she is?

20:47.621 --> 20:50.374
[inhales] Uh, she had
a stake in my parents' casino.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.127
Did Ruth ever ask you
to do anything for Darlene?

20:56.129 --> 20:57.631
You don't think it's a little sus

20:57.714 --> 21:00.217
to have a 15-year-old boy
taking care of your finances?

21:01.385 --> 21:03.804
Well, if you've been dragged
into something, I can help you.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.932
You're a minor. We'll figure it out.
But if you lie to me--

21:07.015 --> 21:08.433
Everything all right?

21:11.019 --> 21:13.772
-Just asking a few questions.
-I can see that.

21:13.855 --> 21:17.859
You're interrogating a minor
without a guardian present, Deputy?

21:18.610 --> 21:19.695
Acting sheriff.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.113
Ah.

21:21.196 --> 21:24.283
Now that you're here,
maybe we can go inside.

21:25.909 --> 21:29.288
Oh, I don't think so. Jonah and I
were just about to go to lunch.

21:29.371 --> 21:32.624
Weren't we, Jonah? Goodbye, Deputy.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.311
[Marty] Hmm.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.647
-This is interesting.
-Interesting?

21:56.606 --> 21:59.860
Your-- your revenue's down
the last couple of quarters.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.738
Tell Navarro I'm sorry.
We had terrible weather.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.783
It's not your harvest.
It's your-- your shipping cost.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.369
Take a look
at the number of runs you've made.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.455
-And those are not full loads.
-[cell phone ringing]

22:11.538 --> 22:12.789
Um…

22:13.415 --> 22:17.169
You are sending twice as many trucks
as you need north with product

22:17.252 --> 22:19.463
and then south with cash.
I gotta take this.

22:19.546 --> 22:23.675
Um, if you improve efficiency,
you're gonna improve revenue, okay?

22:24.259 --> 22:25.844
Thank you. Hi.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.181
Are you doing okay?

22:30.140 --> 22:32.100
Uh, I'm-- I'm getting used to it.

22:32.184 --> 22:36.480
Uh, I'm-- I'm gathering
some useful information

22:36.563 --> 22:37.606
for the Bureau.

22:37.689 --> 22:41.777
Um, at least, you know,
something to keep them off our backs.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.237
Uh, how are things
going with the Shaw deal?

22:46.114 --> 22:50.410
Ruth wouldn't help, so I tipped off,
get this, the new sheriff.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.621
I'm gonna try and stop 'em that way.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.833
But don't worry. I-I'm on my way to Jim's.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.128
And if anybody can get the foundation
back on its feet, it's him.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.756
I thought you said
that he's not talking to you.

23:02.839 --> 23:06.510
Hmm! Yeah, well. [chuckling]

23:06.593 --> 23:07.594
There is that.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.598
Don't worry.

23:12.599 --> 23:13.600
Right.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.186
[clicks]

23:17.646 --> 23:20.440
[sighs]

23:21.566 --> 23:23.485
[doorbell rings]

23:34.079 --> 23:36.331
I see you didn't get my message.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.292
What message?

23:39.376 --> 23:42.921
The one I sent
by not answering your calls.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.633
I understand why
you'd never wanna speak to me.

23:46.716 --> 23:49.511
Oh, not just speak. See, hear.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.595
I get it.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.599
But if I'm in for a beating,
at least let me have it sitting down.

24:03.525 --> 24:08.029
So I, um, I watched a psychotic drug lord

24:08.113 --> 24:10.615
beat the shit out of your husband
in my living room.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.742
I know. I'm sorry.

24:12.826 --> 24:16.621
I had to lie to David
about why I couldn't meet him for lunch.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.833
I have a hard time believing
it's the first time you've lied

24:19.916 --> 24:21.835
to your husband
about what you do for a living.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.630
All right, let--
let me be exceedingly clear.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.300
I don't wanna work for you anymore.

24:29.217 --> 24:33.096
Hmm! I don't think
you would have grabbed onto my coattails

24:33.180 --> 24:35.432
if you didn't think I was going somewhere.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.394
You've worked your whole life for this.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.647
-Don't fuck it up now.
-[Jim scoffs]

24:42.731 --> 24:43.940
I-- [huffs]

24:45.984 --> 24:49.404
[inhales] I could have been killed.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.031
But you weren't.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.992
And I guarantee you

24:54.075 --> 24:56.328
Javi Elizondro
will not be a problem anymore.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.288
And you know this how?

24:59.831 --> 25:01.124
Because he's dead.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.877
Omar Navarro had him killed.

25:04.377 --> 25:05.337
[laughs]

25:06.796 --> 25:09.382
God, somehow that
doesn't make me feel any better.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.843
We'll all feel better
when Navarro's back running the cartel.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.804
[Jim] W-when is that gonna happen?
After his consecutive life sentences?

25:14.888 --> 25:18.099
No, after we get him off the SDN list
and extradite him to Mexico

25:18.183 --> 25:20.227
and bust him out of a prison down there.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.187
[laughs]

25:24.147 --> 25:25.232
[Wendy] We can do it.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.528
All we need is the full power
of our board of directors.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.030
Schafer, Markham, Bowlsby.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.742
All five whales.
They can pressure the Treasury Department.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.370
You do know
that your whales won't be in line

25:38.453 --> 25:40.247
until you have donations coming in.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.041
I know the Shaw deal is stalled.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.544
I'm working on it.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.921
And in the meantime,
you can help me get more donors.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.757
How do you propose I do that?

25:51.633 --> 25:55.637
By gathering as many whales as possible
to headline a fundraiser at the casino.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.181
End of the week.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.315
I'm gonna make some calls.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.900
I'm not back in the fold.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.362
I need to see some progress.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.407
Help me and you will.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.910
[Kim] Yeah, I remember her.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.538
Some people just stick in your mind.

26:21.621 --> 26:22.831
How-- how so?

26:23.832 --> 26:26.376
She was real buttoned-up, aggressive.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.170
But with a smile, you know?

26:30.505 --> 26:31.965
And the brother?

26:32.465 --> 26:33.800
He was agitated.

26:33.883 --> 26:37.596
He, uh, said some Mexican cartel boss
was out to kill him.

26:38.888 --> 26:39.889
[Mel] Omar Navarro?

26:42.183 --> 26:44.978
-You telling me that was real?
-I'm not telling you any such thing.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.107
So what'd the sister say
after the cartel bit?

26:49.190 --> 26:51.818
She blamed it on a supposed mental illness

26:51.901 --> 26:54.237
and got defensive
when I asked to search the car.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.156
Hmm. So, but did you?

26:57.157 --> 26:59.284
No, like I said, she was real buttoned-up.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.040
[Mel sighs]

27:05.540 --> 27:07.167
-Thank you.
-[Kim] Yeah.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.462
Did you happen to see
which way they were headed?

27:10.545 --> 27:11.546
East on 50.

27:14.966 --> 27:18.928
'Cause I'm trying to locate, um,
other places they may have stopped.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.639
Hmm. Yeah.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.102
You think maybe I could get access to any
security cams your department might have?

27:28.313 --> 27:30.273
I might be able
to get you a few cameras along 50.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.942
-Hmm. Great.
-[Kim] Just up to the border.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.572
Yeah, Greg. I need a favor.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.036
Thanks.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.436
Fuck.

29:13.543 --> 29:15.462
[Ruth] No, no, he knows I'm coming.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.091
What business you got
harassing my employees?

29:20.175 --> 29:22.051
You want something, you talk to me.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.554
And you don't have me followed.
That's profiling.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.890
No, that's police work.

29:26.973 --> 29:27.974
Close the door.

29:34.397 --> 29:36.691
I got a tip
you're about to make a big mistake.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.276
Oh, oh, you did?

29:38.359 --> 29:41.321
So you're
in Wendy Byrde's pocket now, huh?

29:41.905 --> 29:43.198
For fuck's sakes, Ronnie.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.284
Seems to me, she's just worried about you.
Don't wanna see you go south.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.245
Some fucking detective you are, then.

29:49.329 --> 29:52.665
So you're telling me you're
not taking over where Darlene left off?

29:52.749 --> 29:56.294
No, what I'm telling you
is Wendy's playing chess,

29:56.377 --> 29:58.630
and you're playing fucking Candy Land.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.722
[inhales] I aim to be sheriff permanent,

30:08.389 --> 30:11.142
and I don't need anything fucking that up.

30:11.226 --> 30:15.313
So go home, cool off, don't screw up.

30:16.105 --> 30:18.691
It ain't that hard, Langmore.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.654
Get out!

30:33.706 --> 30:34.624
Fuck.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.334
Bitch.

30:40.463 --> 30:41.673
[Frank Jr.] Let me see that.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.135
Yeah, that's good. That--

30:52.934 --> 30:54.936
Guys, you give us a minute?

30:59.899 --> 31:01.484
Close the door on your way out.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.453
So, do I owe you a drink?

31:18.251 --> 31:19.168
[opens drawer]

31:19.252 --> 31:20.295
[inhales]

31:22.005 --> 31:23.047
[exhales]

31:24.340 --> 31:26.342
You get rid of that gun like I told you?

31:27.176 --> 31:28.845
Yeah, all good.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.598
But that's not why I'm here.

31:32.348 --> 31:34.559
I need you to give me
a hand with something.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.644
For a price, of course.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.105
Yeah, of course.

31:39.188 --> 31:42.442
-I need to move another load of heroin--
-Darlene's heroin?

31:43.568 --> 31:45.445
Yeah, but… [scoffs]

31:45.528 --> 31:47.155
…only the local cops are on my ass.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.240
About what?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.536
I think the Byrdes are fucking with me.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.416
And you want me to help fuck back. Oh.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.462
[chuckles] Yeah.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.672
I'll give you a hand.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.927
What's so fucking funny about it?

32:10.094 --> 32:13.514
I just never had you pegged
as a Darlene Snell wannabe.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.684
You always seemed
more like a junior Marty Byrde type.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.939
Fuck you. I ain't either of them.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.153
-[gulps]
-[sighs]

32:27.236 --> 32:30.865
Okay, let me look at last month's here.

32:33.701 --> 32:38.039
I'm his best fucking earner. I don't know
why he's gotta go through my accounts.

32:38.539 --> 32:41.000
Well, as I said,
you're gonna have to ask him.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.461
I'm asking you.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.380
This is what Navarro wants.

32:45.463 --> 32:49.008
I'm sure you don't want me
to tell him that you're refusing. Yeah?

32:49.092 --> 32:50.718
Fucking pinche gabacho.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.887
Let me see the receivables.
Those are there, right?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.305
Yes, sir.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.516
[in Spanish] Don't fucking call him "sir."

32:59.811 --> 33:00.979
[in English] Hello!

33:01.062 --> 33:06.609
You've got
some cash flow discrepancies here.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.361
There's a-- there's a few of 'em.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.363
[exhales]

33:19.539 --> 33:21.249
[Arturo] What the fuck did you do?

33:22.625 --> 33:23.960
I don't know how that could be.

33:24.043 --> 33:28.131
Someone dropped a decimal point
on three shipments in a row.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.343
Are you fucking cheating
the cartel, cabrón?

33:32.427 --> 33:34.220
It has to be a mistake.

33:34.303 --> 33:37.181
Well, once would be a mistake.
You know, three times is…

33:38.141 --> 33:39.434
But I didn't do that.

33:39.934 --> 33:42.770
I didn't do that! [grunts]

33:43.980 --> 33:45.398

33:46.399 --> 33:49.777

-No, no! No, no, no, no.

35:52.441 --> 35:53.985
"Bad"? What is "bad"?

35:55.820 --> 35:57.155
He's in a coma.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.243
Um…

36:03.911 --> 36:07.498
Do they, uh,
do they think he's gonna wake up?

36:08.082 --> 36:10.960
I don't know. He'd lost a lot of blood.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.298
Should we get you out of there?

36:17.258 --> 36:20.052
Uh, no, no, no,
that would be a-- a sign of weakness.

36:20.136 --> 36:23.973
Whoever ordered that hit will know
that the attempt, uh, just happened.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.350
Um…

36:26.434 --> 36:30.396
we cannot let anyone know
that he's in a coma, you know.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.815
He's gotta be impossible to take down.

36:33.399 --> 36:37.111
He killed his attacker.
He is strong. He's still giving orders.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.448
We need to find out who did this.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.742
Well, then what?

36:44.493 --> 36:46.245
We do what Navarro would do.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.674
Uh, let me-- let me--
let me call you right back.

37:00.509 --> 37:01.427
Hi.

37:02.845 --> 37:03.679
Uh…

37:05.431 --> 37:07.266
Can I talk to you for a second?

37:07.350 --> 37:09.894
I-I just-- I got a message from…

37:11.520 --> 37:15.358
from Omar this morning,
and he said not to worry.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.361
He would say that.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.240
He's strong.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.618
He-- he killed the man
who tried to kill him.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.667
Can I see him?

37:33.918 --> 37:39.006
No, no, he's-- he's in lockdown
for his own protection.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.385
[sighs] You know they're gonna try again.

37:45.471 --> 37:48.057
And that's-- that's what
I wanna speak to you about.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.853
Can I ask you about
one of the lieutenants?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.106
Cabrera.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.985
You think he was behind this?

38:01.153 --> 38:03.864
-I'm gathering information.
-Hmm.

38:05.741 --> 38:08.077
I've known Arturo since he was a child.

38:09.078 --> 38:13.124
He and Javi were friends,
but he was always jealous of him.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.584
His blood tie to my brother.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.342
I caught him cheating the cartel.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.976
Javi once told me that
if he ever became the cartel chief,

38:33.185 --> 38:35.521
he would get rid of Arturo first thing.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.316
He never trusted him.

38:45.531 --> 38:48.075
[men grunting]

38:48.659 --> 38:51.120
[shouting in Spanish]

38:54.832 --> 38:57.126
All right, bring him up on his knees.

39:03.507 --> 39:06.886
[Arturo] You're making
a big fucking mistake, gabacho.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.054
[panting]

39:09.597 --> 39:11.849
Get this fucking thing off of me!

39:18.272 --> 39:19.190
[spits]

39:19.774 --> 39:20.941
[grunts]

39:29.700 --> 39:33.204
Navarro knows that
you were behind the attempt on his life.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.246
Okay?

39:34.747 --> 39:36.832
He said that? [panting]

39:38.876 --> 39:39.960
He said that.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.756
[in Spanish] Then he's a fucking idiot.

39:46.133 --> 39:47.635
[grunts]

39:50.721 --> 39:53.724
[in English] Things'll go a lot easier
on you if you just tell the truth, okay?

39:53.808 --> 39:56.352
[panting] I am!

40:00.356 --> 40:03.734
You've been skimming money.
You were jealous of Javi,

40:03.818 --> 40:06.779
and you don't know why
Navarro chose him over you.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.407
You don't know shit!

40:12.993 --> 40:14.620
[grunts]

40:14.703 --> 40:15.996
[groans]

40:16.664 --> 40:19.041
[panting]

40:19.125 --> 40:21.377
How about you tell me
who else is involved?

40:22.420 --> 40:24.713
Fuck you!

40:28.259 --> 40:30.261
[grunting]

40:32.972 --> 40:36.725
[Nathan] These are for you.
I think you oughta put 'em up around here.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.603
It's a good picture.

40:40.187 --> 40:41.272
Yeah.

40:41.355 --> 40:44.442
That was up Valle Crucis way,
on the Watauga.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.486
I was trying to teach him how to fly cast.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.157
[laughs] I can imagine how that went.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.325
[laughs]

40:55.786 --> 40:56.954
Uh…

40:57.788 --> 40:59.665
I wanted to ask, uh…

41:00.791 --> 41:02.001
How's Jonah?

41:03.335 --> 41:05.546
Is he upset about what happened?

41:09.008 --> 41:11.427
He didn't tell you about the sheriff?

41:13.762 --> 41:15.639
-What about the sheriff?
-[scoffs]

41:15.723 --> 41:20.102
[laughs] Well, if it wasn't for me,
Lord knows how far that could have gone.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.520
What are you talking about?

41:21.604 --> 41:24.690
I caught him interrogating him
in his motel room.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.739
-Do you know what he was after?
-I don't know.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.616
I don't care.

41:34.116 --> 41:35.826
He was harassing your son,

41:36.702 --> 41:39.330
which I'd think would be
your primary concern.

41:44.418 --> 41:46.337
I'll put these up.
I'll see you this weekend.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.298
All righty.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.901
[grunting]

42:16.158 --> 42:17.034
That's enough.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.083
[Arturo exhales]

42:57.157 --> 42:57.992
May I?

42:59.451 --> 43:00.286
Sure.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.747
[Benitez grunts]

43:05.666 --> 43:06.834
[sighs]

43:19.763 --> 43:21.265
-Hmm?
-No, thank you.

43:21.348 --> 43:22.808
[Benitez exhales]

43:33.694 --> 43:35.613
After similar ordeals,

43:36.864 --> 43:40.075
Omar usually calls me
to hear his confession.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.083
I'm not Catholic. [mutters]

43:49.918 --> 43:52.254
God's love is for everyone.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.009
Is that why you work at a cartel?

44:00.179 --> 44:02.431
I go where God's most needed.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.395
You think God can love anyone?

44:08.896 --> 44:09.897
You don't?

44:10.564 --> 44:12.358
Uh… [mutters]

44:12.441 --> 44:14.693
It does seem a-- a little arbitrary.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.490
Oh.

44:19.573 --> 44:24.411
You think you're unworthy
of love without condition.

44:25.412 --> 44:26.413
Right?

44:29.083 --> 44:31.043
Nothing comes without conditions.

44:32.252 --> 44:35.464
Well, now,
that's what you're wrestling with.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.681
Do you love unconditionally?

44:51.939 --> 44:54.733
I'm not sure that
it's the smartest thing to do.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.987
Are you loving or judging?

45:00.197 --> 45:03.283
If your love is conditional,
it's also transactional.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.578
Love doesn't keep score, Marty.

45:07.955 --> 45:09.707
It's not self-seeking.

45:16.088 --> 45:18.173
I think it's easier said than done.

45:28.892 --> 45:29.893
Good night.

46:04.219 --> 46:06.930
[engine turns over]

46:42.800 --> 46:44.718
-[clicks]
-It's on.

47:03.904 --> 47:05.906
[sirens wail]

47:14.915 --> 47:17.334
-What's going on? What-- hey!
-Hey, hands on the hood.

47:17.417 --> 47:20.295
-Hey, what the fuck, Ronnie?
-What are you doing out here?

47:21.421 --> 47:23.215
What are you doing out here, Ruth?

47:24.800 --> 47:28.345
I was getting my dead cousin's things
from his dead wife's house.

47:28.428 --> 47:31.098
-Were you? Open it up.
-Mm-hmm.

47:31.974 --> 47:33.058
Let's take a look.

47:43.235 --> 47:47.239
[officer] T-shirt, bong, some books.

47:55.622 --> 47:57.374
You gonna bust me for a bong?

48:00.377 --> 48:01.587
Why rent the truck?

48:03.922 --> 48:06.174
I guess I thought he had a lot more shit.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.178
[Ronnie] Mm-hmm.

48:10.929 --> 48:11.930
[Ruth] Mm-hmm.

48:24.276 --> 48:26.028
[grunting]

48:32.367 --> 48:34.494
-[man 1] That's it.
-[man 2] That it?

48:34.578 --> 48:37.831
-[man 1] That's the last of it.
-[man 2] Okay. Close it up.

49:09.529 --> 49:11.073
[Jonah] Help find Ben.

49:11.156 --> 49:13.367
Check out the website. Please donate.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.828
-Here. Help find Ben.
-[woman] Thank you.

49:21.792 --> 49:22.709
Hey.

49:25.420 --> 49:26.338
Hi.

49:28.131 --> 49:29.841
I know this must feel awful.

49:32.636 --> 49:33.887
Yeah.

49:34.638 --> 49:36.056
-[Jonah] Thank you.
-[man] All right.

49:36.139 --> 49:37.933
Check out the website. Donate.

49:39.810 --> 49:41.144
Gimme some of those.

49:47.109 --> 49:48.110
Thank you.

49:49.027 --> 49:51.947
-Hi. Check out our website.
-[man 2] Thanks.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.409
Hello. Hi. Donate.

49:59.746 --> 50:01.289
Hi. Check out our website.

50:05.544 --> 50:06.586
Hi. Welcome.

50:11.633 --> 50:12.634
[Annalise] Here you go.

50:13.427 --> 50:14.428
Uh, thank you.

50:16.096 --> 50:18.765
Oh, uh, one piece is plenty. [chuckles]

50:18.849 --> 50:21.268
[Annalise] You sure?
It's for a good cause.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.270
All right.

50:23.353 --> 50:26.231
I'll ta-- yeah, I'll take two.
I can have the other one tomorrow, right?

50:26.314 --> 50:27.566
-[Annalise chuckles] Yeah.
-Yeah.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.443
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

50:29.526 --> 50:30.444
[Sam] Mm-hmm.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.364
Just do a little rearranging here.

50:42.122 --> 50:44.332
He seems like such a nice young man.

50:44.958 --> 50:47.836
Is he-- is he all alone in the world?

50:49.546 --> 50:50.380
Kind of.

50:51.673 --> 50:54.009
His mother got hit by a truck and died.

50:54.760 --> 50:57.846
-And then he fell in love with a stripper.
-[Annalise] Oh, my.

50:57.929 --> 50:59.723
[Charlotte]
They were supposed to get married,

50:59.806 --> 51:03.018
but apparently, he had
a bad gambling addiction, so she left him.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.688
I don't know what's wrong with him now.

51:09.066 --> 51:10.817
-[Annalise] Aww.
-[Wendy] Hey.

51:12.277 --> 51:13.445
How's it going?

51:15.155 --> 51:17.616
-Can I steal you for a minute?
-Yeah.

51:23.580 --> 51:24.748
I need a favor.

51:25.332 --> 51:27.000
I'm doing you one right now.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.335
I know. I just…

51:30.295 --> 51:32.506
I need you
at the foundation event tonight.

51:33.215 --> 51:36.885
Charlotte,
it's the Byrde Family Foundation.

51:36.968 --> 51:38.678
I could really use some family there.

51:38.762 --> 51:43.016
Well, you should have thought about that
before you forced Dad to go to Mexico.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.060
I just talked to him.

51:45.143 --> 51:47.479
I promise you, he's safe. Please.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.858
-If we don't get some big donations soon--
-Okay, okay, fine.

51:53.151 --> 51:54.152
I'll go.

51:54.694 --> 51:57.405
But, please, go easy.

51:57.489 --> 52:00.283
Okay, okay. Thank you.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.036
[Charlotte] Oh.

52:04.079 --> 52:05.330
[exhales]

52:05.413 --> 52:06.873
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

52:10.335 --> 52:11.795
You proud of yourself?

52:11.878 --> 52:14.965
You got people thinking
he really might come back.

52:15.048 --> 52:17.592
You got your kids fucking lying to people.

52:17.676 --> 52:19.594
[Wendy] No one asked you to come here.

52:20.846 --> 52:22.305
He did.

52:23.849 --> 52:25.934
Poor fucker doesn't have a clue
what he spawned.

52:26.017 --> 52:27.352
What do you want, Ruth?

52:27.435 --> 52:31.982
Your little plan
with the sheriff didn't work, Wendy.

52:32.065 --> 52:33.024
The Shaw deal's done.

52:33.608 --> 52:36.069
So you need
to get the fuck up out of my business.

52:38.738 --> 52:39.990
You got me?

52:51.334 --> 52:53.336
[heavy metal music blaring]

53:03.346 --> 53:04.806
Fuck you, Marty Byrde!

53:24.534 --> 53:26.536
[grunting]

53:30.624 --> 53:36.129
Twelve yeses,
um, seven nos, but 11 maybes.

53:36.213 --> 53:39.591
-Hmm. Better start calling the maybes.
-Yeah, I'd put a pin in that.

53:39.674 --> 53:41.760
[exhales] I called Schafer
and the other board members.

53:41.843 --> 53:43.303
Told them the event was off.

53:43.386 --> 53:46.765
-A maintenance issue at the casino.
-Why would you do that?

53:46.848 --> 53:50.477
Because Shaw Medical is pulling
their charitable contributions

53:50.560 --> 53:52.103
from your rehab venture.

53:52.187 --> 53:54.522
-[hesitates] They can't do that.
-They can.

53:54.606 --> 53:56.942
I'm just saving us the humiliation.

53:57.025 --> 53:58.443
Okay, look. Here's the rub.

53:58.526 --> 54:01.613
Now, I know you know this,
but it bears repeating.

54:01.696 --> 54:05.283
You cannot get the Schafers of the world
on your board without the money.

54:05.367 --> 54:07.494
You can't get the money
without the Schafers.

54:07.577 --> 54:09.621
Everyone needs
to believe that everybody else

54:09.704 --> 54:12.040
is tripping over themselves
to get in line.

54:13.416 --> 54:15.377
We have one more crack at this.

54:18.922 --> 54:20.924
[dialing]

54:21.800 --> 54:23.843
[rings]

54:23.927 --> 54:25.595
[Clare's voice]
Hi, you've reached my cell.

54:25.679 --> 54:28.098
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.

54:28.181 --> 54:30.642
Clare, it's Wendy.

54:31.726 --> 54:33.520
I need you to understand something.

54:33.603 --> 54:37.524
If I'm not happy,
the people I work for are not happy,

54:37.607 --> 54:39.818
and I think you know what that means.

54:39.901 --> 54:43.029
So I'm gonna give you
one more chance to fix this.

54:50.537 --> 54:52.247
[Marty] You gotta tell me what you did.

54:52.330 --> 54:54.916
-You gotta tell me the truth. Let him up.
-[Arturo gags]

54:55.000 --> 54:55.959
[coughs]

54:56.042 --> 54:57.502
[panting]

54:58.378 --> 54:59.421
[gasps]

55:00.422 --> 55:02.966
Tell me that you ordered
the hit on Navarro. Come on.

55:03.049 --> 55:05.468
[panting] I didn't do shit!

55:07.262 --> 55:08.263
I told you.

55:09.014 --> 55:10.223
I didn't do shit.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.933
-Back down.
-[Arturo] No!

55:12.017 --> 55:14.144
[grunting]

55:14.227 --> 55:15.729
I know that you did it!

55:16.604 --> 55:18.773
I know that you ordered the hit!
Let him up.

[Arturo panting]

55:20.483 --> 55:22.902
You tell me that I'm right,

[panting]

55:27.365 --> 55:29.367
-Okay!
-[Marty] Okay what?

55:33.330 --> 55:35.165
I fuck with the books.

55:35.248 --> 55:38.710
As his top earner,
I thought I deserved it.

55:38.793 --> 55:40.170
I fuck with the books.

55:42.088 --> 55:43.923
But I didn't try to have him killed.

Please tell me the truth.
Please tell me that you ordered the hit.

[panting]

56:24.047 --> 56:24.881
I did it.

56:24.964 --> 56:26.216
What did you do?

56:29.177 --> 56:30.303
I ordered the hit.

56:31.805 --> 56:32.806
Say it again.

56:34.516 --> 56:35.850
I ordered the hit.

56:37.102 --> 56:38.436
I ordered the hit!

56:43.024 --> 56:45.485
Enough. You've asked.

56:46.194 --> 56:47.112
Enough.

56:49.864 --> 56:50.990
Ya, para.

57:00.125 --> 57:01.251
Are you okay?

57:09.801 --> 57:11.136
What are you gonna do?

57:13.680 --> 57:15.098
What else can I do?
