[shovel thudding]

01:12.530 --> 01:13.823
[horn honks]

01:19.454 --> 01:20.997
[indistinct chatter]

01:23.333 --> 01:24.167
[Marty] Ruth!

01:25.543 --> 01:28.338
-[workers speaking Spanish]
-Ruth.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.465
I don't care
how many people you send at me.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.383
I'm not fucking laundering.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.429
I don't care. I don't need you to anymore.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.224
[Ruth] Well, I'm pretty fucking busy here.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.810
Okay. Did you get enough, uh, mud on you?

01:42.435 --> 01:44.813
-Just tell me what you fucking want.
-[Marty] Yeah.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.357
[exhales] You gotta help me
get my kids back.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.777
Oh, God. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:50.860 --> 01:51.861
I'm not.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.073
Javi's mom knows that Navarro
did not kill Javi, and she wants answers.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.618
Unless you help me get my kids back,
I'm gonna tell her exactly what happened.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.956
You're really willing to get me killed.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.125
[Marty] I didn't shoot Javi.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.462
And why am I responsible for your family?

02:09.546 --> 02:12.298
Because I don't know what else to do.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.552
Wendy has checked herself in to
the same fucking hospital that Ben was in.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.762
Says she's not leaving
until she gets her kids back.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.889
-That's not my business.
-The fuck it isn't.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.643
You killed Javi. You refuse to launder,
and you stole Jonah and made it so that

02:23.726 --> 02:26.229
you might be the only person
he'll actually still listen to.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.856
So it's all your business.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.236
And what if he doesn't listen to me?

02:34.362 --> 02:36.739
I don't know. Fucking kidnap him.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.950
Kill Wendy's dad.
I don't give a fuck what you do,

02:39.033 --> 02:41.411
but if my kids get in that van
and they go to North Carolina,

02:41.494 --> 02:43.663
I'm telling Javi's mom everything.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.626
Is this you? Or Wendy?

02:50.461 --> 02:51.462
[mouths]

02:57.302 --> 02:58.595
[chuckles]

04:07.747 --> 04:11.334
[inhales, exhales]

04:30.979 --> 04:33.147
[Camila] Where is Wendy?
Is everything okay?

04:33.815 --> 04:34.857
[Marty] Uh, yeah, there's--

04:34.941 --> 04:37.318
there's so much work
to be done for the foundation event,

04:37.402 --> 04:39.904
we decided to divide and conquer.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.700
So what is this?

04:43.783 --> 04:46.995
Am I being divided,
or am I being conquered?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.082
And your kids?

04:51.874 --> 04:54.294
-Are they still out of the house?
-[Marty] Yeah.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.587
So we can speak freely?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.549
Yeah. Yeah, um,

05:00.341 --> 05:03.886
so, uh, these are the numbered accounts.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.347
Uh, they can be accessed directly by you

05:06.431 --> 05:11.561
or by anyone that you need
to pay to facilitate your end.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.773
[inhales] What about my brother?

05:16.774 --> 05:20.945
[inhales] Uh, the FBI
has agreed to transfer him,

05:21.029 --> 05:22.864
and-- and he won't get any warning.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.450
[inhales] Um,

05:26.326 --> 05:29.329
Camila, if--
if something were to happen to him

05:29.412 --> 05:32.165
while they were moving him
to the new location,

05:33.166 --> 05:36.919
if he were to try to escape and be killed,

05:38.087 --> 05:39.130
for example…

05:41.215 --> 05:43.176
it would just be considered fate.

05:49.223 --> 05:53.561
I am not putting anything into motion
until I speak with the FBI,

05:53.644 --> 05:56.230
and they will give me
their assurances face-to-face.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.859
That's exactly what
your brother said once.

06:00.693 --> 06:01.819
He was a good boss.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.280
[Marty] That meeting's being set.

06:05.573 --> 06:06.908
[Camila sighs]

06:10.370 --> 06:13.039
Tell me again about the day my son died.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.463
Uh, there's just
not that much to tell, Camila.

06:20.546 --> 06:21.798
You know, um,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.426
we had that meeting
with Javi in the morning.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.761
It was a good meeting.

06:27.345 --> 06:31.057
Wendy and I did some work
to try to set up that move to Chicago,

06:31.140 --> 06:33.726
and, uh, and then
we had dinner with Clare that night,

06:33.810 --> 06:35.353
went back to the hotel.

06:35.436 --> 06:38.564
Next day, came home, right here.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.360
[Camila sighs]

06:44.153 --> 06:45.571
Are you having second thoughts?

06:45.655 --> 06:46.656
No.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.034
Good.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.831
[woman on TV] Individually,
a meerkat may resemble a squirrel,

06:54.914 --> 06:58.835
standing less than one-foot high
and weighing a mere two pounds…

06:58.918 --> 07:00.920
[continues indistinctly]

07:03.714 --> 07:06.426
[orderly] Excuse me, Mrs. Byrde.
You have a visitor.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.269
I had to see what was bullshit
and what wasn't.

07:27.155 --> 07:31.242
-At least you're really here.
-I'm sure that makes you very satisfied.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.998
If I do what I need to do,
that's gotta be enough.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.251
I can't control
whether they stay with you.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.671
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:46.632 --> 07:47.467
Wh--

07:49.051 --> 07:50.887
Marty told me,

07:50.970 --> 07:54.223
if I didn't keep your kids
from going to North Carolina,

07:55.016 --> 07:57.268
he'd tell Javi's mom that I killed him.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.565
[Wendy chuckles]

08:02.648 --> 08:05.276
-[Ruth] Of course that makes you happy.
-[inhales]

08:08.029 --> 08:09.697
What do you want from me, Ruth?

08:10.448 --> 08:13.659
I want you to promise

08:13.743 --> 08:17.163
that if I do my part, the rest is on you.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.998
You're their mom.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.211
If they don't wanna be with you,
I can't control that.

08:23.294 --> 08:27.965
So, if I keep my end,
you'll tell Marty to call off narco bitch.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.136
I promise.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.225
Your dad's a real piece of shit,
by the way.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.142
I'm sorry.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.775
I'm sorry about yours.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.080
[inhales] Just how bad is it in here?

09:00.790 --> 09:03.042
[sighs]

09:04.126 --> 09:04.961
Bad.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.342
But it's bearable, right?

09:14.345 --> 09:15.680
Everything's bearable.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.603
You were right.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.317
If I'd have just left him here,

09:30.152 --> 09:31.445
he'd still be alive.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.337
-[lock clicks]
-[buzzer sounds]

09:48.421 --> 09:51.257
[Jonah] Have Mom and Dad tried
to talk you into going to the gala?

09:51.340 --> 09:53.634
[Charlotte] They know
we're leaving beforehand.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.761
Yeah, I just-- I just figured,

09:56.846 --> 09:59.890
it's a really big deal,
and you helped make it all possible.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.936
It's okay if part of you
wishes we were going.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.356
I don't wish that.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.788
[ratcheting]

10:56.864 --> 10:58.282
[knock on door]

11:02.912 --> 11:03.788
Hi.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.083
I thought you and I should share a drink,

11:07.166 --> 11:09.377
seeing as how you're leaving tomorrow.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.047
It's a little early, isn't it?

11:15.633 --> 11:16.467
For Ben.

11:22.264 --> 11:26.852
[Nathan] So, what was it about you
that got Ben over the blonde hump, anyway?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.562
Oh, I don't know.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.856
Well, I guess I got lucky.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.610
You know, small town and he didn't
have that many girls to choose from.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.653
[laughing]

11:35.736 --> 11:38.906
I used to get on him
that he liked loose women.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.783
Well, I couldn't condone it.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.078
Didn't blame him, mind you.
Young man, after all.

11:45.121 --> 11:45.996
[Ruth] Right.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.793
And it's pretty hard to get down on a boy,

11:51.752 --> 11:54.046
when his own sister, uh, well…

11:54.130 --> 11:54.964
[Ruth] Hmm.

11:56.173 --> 11:59.260
Nah, trust me. You don't gotta hold
your tongue when it comes to Wendy.

11:59.343 --> 12:02.596
Yeah. Let's just say she had a reputation.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.597
[Ruth] Hmm.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.768
-Well, you beat her.
-[scoffs]

12:09.562 --> 12:10.396
How's that?

12:11.313 --> 12:14.442
You won. You got Jonah and Charlotte.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.111
-Right. Yeah, that's right.
-[clears throat]

12:17.194 --> 12:21.866
And for what it's worth,
every beating I ever got from my daddy,

12:21.949 --> 12:23.659
I knew it was my fault.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.205
We could use more people like you
in the congregation.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.207
[both laugh]

12:30.291 --> 12:34.170
These days, it is a much
softer scripture than I remember. [laughs]

12:34.795 --> 12:36.547
[Ruth] Hmm.

12:36.630 --> 12:40.092
So, uh, did Ben get whupped?

12:40.676 --> 12:42.636
You know, we both know how he was.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.139
Ben embarrassed the family.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.476
It wasn't his fault.
That was just a glitch.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.479
The hard part

12:52.396 --> 12:55.024
is having that one child
that causes you shame.

12:55.107 --> 12:55.983
[Ruth] Hmm.

12:56.066 --> 13:01.071
And, uh, then you look to the other one,
supposed to be better,

13:02.573 --> 13:04.033
and she's even worse.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.830
So, uh… [clears throat]

13:10.998 --> 13:12.124
So tell me,

13:13.501 --> 13:16.670
what are you gonna do when it turns out

13:17.421 --> 13:22.760
Jonah's a mini Marty,
and Charlotte's a little fucking Wendy?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.095
They'll get in line.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.350
And then they'll be gone, right?

13:30.601 --> 13:33.437
-That's the nature of parenting.
-Hmm.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.857
[gulps, exhales]

13:40.694 --> 13:43.280
You don't even fucking want them, do you?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.829
-I don't like that kind of language.
-I don't care.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.042
Have I done something to offend you?

13:55.125 --> 13:57.920
[Ruth] No, it's just the truth.

13:58.003 --> 14:03.300
You don't give a flying fuck
about Jonah or Charlotte.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.347
Well, I won't be spoken
to that way by some…

14:10.891 --> 14:11.851
What?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.435
By you.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.939
I'd like you to leave now, please.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.735
I'll leave if you tell me

14:21.819 --> 14:25.489
why you went to court
for kids you don't even fucking want.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.455
How about "fuck her"?

14:35.416 --> 14:37.543
Is that language you can understand?

14:38.919 --> 14:41.380
She was a slut… [shudders]

14:41.463 --> 14:43.924
…and an embarrassment. [shudders]

14:44.008 --> 14:49.096
And she deserves
to feel every bit of shame that I felt.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.183
Now you have a blessed fucking day.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.443
-[sets down glass]
-[opens, closes door]

15:02.526 --> 15:04.528
-[plastic crinkles]
-[ice clinks]

15:06.322 --> 15:08.949
[pours drink]

15:14.955 --> 15:16.540
What do you think you're doing?

15:17.666 --> 15:21.420
You're gonna tell Jonah and Charlotte
they can't come with you.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.548
I'll do no such thing.

15:35.100 --> 15:35.935
Now,

15:37.645 --> 15:40.731
they're about to be running here,
and when they do,

15:41.315 --> 15:44.860
you're gonna tell them
exactly what you just told me,

15:44.944 --> 15:47.863
or I'll shoot you in your fucking head.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.200
That one.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.037
[Jonah] Grandpa.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.832
What the fuck's going on here?

16:05.839 --> 16:08.008
[man] Anything in your pockets,
in the tray.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.135
Shoes with laces, in the box.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.852
-[buzzer sounds]
-[lock clicks]

16:42.668 --> 16:44.920
This is messed up. You know that, right?

16:46.839 --> 16:47.673
I know.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.093
[Charlotte] So, you know,

16:51.885 --> 16:54.054
just because we're here
does not mean that we're staying.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.264
I-I know. I know.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.684
Just, please.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.102
[sighs]

17:01.145 --> 17:02.021
Um…

17:04.398 --> 17:07.609
[sniffles] When Ruth came by earlier…

17:09.445 --> 17:10.738
[shudders]

17:13.615 --> 17:16.785
…she told me that it was her fault
that Ben was dead.

17:17.703 --> 17:22.249
She said that if she had just
left him in here, he'd still be alive.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.251
And…

17:27.004 --> 17:29.965
I need you to know
how clearly I know she's wrong.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.387
It's my fault. [gasps]

17:39.058 --> 17:40.059
All of it.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.519
[gasps]

17:44.480 --> 17:45.981
I mean, in the end, I don't know.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.609
I don't know--
I don't know what more I could have done.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.737
I mean, I have thought about it.
I have thought about it a thousand times.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.406
[gasps] He-- he would
have gotten us all killed.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.077
But we-- we--
we should never have been there.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.165
And the truth is, Ben is dead…

18:05.834 --> 18:09.463
because I am selfish, and I trapped him.

18:10.839 --> 18:14.093
[inhales] I knew what our life was.
I knew who he was.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.846
I should never have let him stay.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.181
He was planning to go,

18:19.264 --> 18:22.851
and I asked him to stay
because I wanted him around.

18:26.313 --> 18:29.817
And I wanted to believe
it could all be different. [sniffles]

18:30.734 --> 18:32.069
[sighs, sniffles]

18:39.076 --> 18:40.744

is about to be out of the picture. So--

to launder money out of the casino.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.420

28:33.503 --> 28:36.589

if they're sanctioning it, okay?

tomorrow and hear them out, please?

was to stop laundering.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.937
Start clean.

35:48.020 --> 35:51.566
Well, it ain't a crime
if you're doing it for the FBI.

35:51.649 --> 35:55.695
[scoffs] You got a whole lot more faith
in those fuckers than I do.

35:57.822 --> 36:01.117
Oh, Cheryl, they're still adding RSVPs.
Think you can bring more tables out?

36:01.200 --> 36:03.953
-Sure. We'll put 'em audience left.
-[Rachel] Great.

36:05.121 --> 36:09.041
Those dickheads are lucky I got
a work ethic as a preexisting condition.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.377
[Ruth] Well,
all we gotta do is hear them out.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.213
[Rachel sighs] Or…

36:17.258 --> 36:19.719
we could get the fuck out of here.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.264
We talked about this.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.436
How long before they find out?

36:29.270 --> 36:31.898
No one's finding that body.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.567
And besides,
Marty says if the deal goes through,

36:34.650 --> 36:37.528
that means Navarro
won't be around to ask questions.

[Rachel gasps]

36:46.954 --> 36:47.788
When I--

36:48.956 --> 36:50.499
when I pulled the trigger,

36:51.209 --> 36:54.420
he stared at me
like nothing in the world made sense.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.717
Good. I hope it was fucking painful too.

37:02.803 --> 37:05.097
It wasn't like killing an animal,
you know?

37:06.557 --> 37:08.184
He was a piece of shit.

37:11.562 --> 37:12.521
Still.

37:15.524 --> 37:19.320
He murdered my dad, and he murdered Ben.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.865
I still killed a person.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.078
No, you didn't.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.956
You were never there.

37:33.668 --> 37:36.045
[car door opens, closes]

37:40.424 --> 37:43.844
Oh. Hi, there.
Uh, you must be here for the meeting.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.555
Every-- everyone is back in the, um…

37:52.478 --> 37:53.646
Good afternoon.

37:53.729 --> 37:57.149
Your group is meeting
back in the parlor. If you, um…

38:01.237 --> 38:07.159
[Marty] Camila Navarro Elizondro,
this is, uh, Special Agent in Charge Clay,

38:07.243 --> 38:09.829
Executive Assistant Director Graves.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.580
[Graves] So you're aware…

38:11.664 --> 38:12.707
[sighs]

38:12.790 --> 38:15.459
…Mr. Navarro
is being transferred this evening.

38:28.723 --> 38:29.890
[Ruth] Hiya, Harry.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.267
Why, Ruth.

38:33.394 --> 38:36.147
Well, this meeting is getting,
uh, eclectic.

38:36.230 --> 38:39.650
Hmm. Are all
the swinging dicks already here?

38:39.734 --> 38:42.862
Well, that's not
a characterization I'd offer, but, um…

38:42.945 --> 38:43.904
[inhales sharply]

38:44.989 --> 38:45.823
…yes.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.617
This is Rachel Garrison and Ruth Langmore.

38:48.701 --> 38:53.789
Uh, these are Agents Clay and Graves,
and that is Camila Elizondro.

38:53.873 --> 38:57.460
Uh, Ruth and Rachel are gonna be taking
over operations for the Missouri Belle,

38:57.543 --> 38:59.795
and they're well aware of our mission.

38:59.879 --> 39:00.713
Um,

39:01.672 --> 39:05.593
in fact,
I-I taught Ruth the protocols myself.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.053
[Hannah exhales]

39:07.136 --> 39:08.387
[Ruth] Before we start,

39:08.471 --> 39:12.224
I just wanna say
the last FBI agent my partner worked with

39:12.308 --> 39:14.101
fucked her up inside out.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.353
Got her strung out.

39:15.978 --> 39:19.857
So, we'd like an apology
before we agree to sit down

39:19.940 --> 39:21.776
and talk about any of this shit.

39:26.447 --> 39:29.909
[inhales] On behalf of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

39:29.992 --> 39:33.037
I'd like to apologize
for our treatment of you.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.917
Um, no, thank you. I-I appreciate that.

39:40.419 --> 39:46.801
These are papers
guaranteeing your freedom from prosecution

39:46.884 --> 39:48.969
as a cooperating witness.

39:49.762 --> 39:55.643
Ms. Elizondro,
our agreement will be verbal but binding.

40:02.650 --> 40:03.818
Shall we sit?

40:17.998 --> 40:19.583

-[sighs]

40:53.951 --> 40:54.952
Well, uh,

40:56.829 --> 40:58.247
moving to North Carolina.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.499
Well, I can see that.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.419
[Sam] Annalise thinks
it would be a good idea.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.924
Says she can, uh,
teach me how to be grateful.

41:09.008 --> 41:09.967
Hmm.

41:10.885 --> 41:14.430
I'm sure she'll be willing
to teach you a lot of things. [chuckles]

41:16.015 --> 41:16.849
So…

41:19.768 --> 41:20.644
I guess this is…

41:21.687 --> 41:22.980
Fond farewell.

41:23.063 --> 41:25.107
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

41:27.276 --> 41:28.944
Thanks for always having my back.

41:38.871 --> 41:40.873
[woman] Thank you. We'll see you.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.670
Hey, congratulations on Sam.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.840
I mean, you managed to save
at least one lost soul. [chuckles]

41:49.924 --> 41:51.342
What do you want, Wendy?

41:53.219 --> 41:55.596
-I-I'm not-- I'm not here to fight.
-[Nathan] Then what?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.767
Our foundation has made
a very generous donation

41:59.850 --> 42:02.311
to the site dedicated to finding Ben.

42:02.811 --> 42:05.314
There is a healthy stipend

42:06.315 --> 42:08.192
in perpetuity until he's found.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.654
I'd like you to be in charge.

42:13.113 --> 42:15.533
You can afford to continue your work.

42:15.616 --> 42:18.077
[Wendy] Or any other work you see fit.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.459
Goodbye, Wendy. [chuckles]

42:27.044 --> 42:27.878
Safe trip.

42:30.673 --> 42:32.341
You get everything you wanted.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.053
Get to be the grieving father.

42:36.554 --> 42:40.099
You have money.
You have status in your church.

42:41.767 --> 42:43.477
You just don't get to hurt me.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.400
I suppose you're proud of yourself.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.152
Not at all.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.084
[Marty] Hi.

43:07.626 --> 43:08.711
Hi.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.255
Hey. [sighs]

43:13.007 --> 43:14.758
[Wendy] Oh, Charlotte, you look beautiful.

43:41.827 --> 43:42.911
[Jim] Excuse me.

43:48.876 --> 43:49.918
[Marty] Nice turnout.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.462
Congratulations.

43:52.504 --> 43:53.714
Has anyone backed out?

43:53.797 --> 43:57.593
Oh, not only has no one backed out,
we're still fielding requests.

43:58.260 --> 44:01.180
This whole place
smells like freshly minted money.

44:01.263 --> 44:03.557
Are most of the late additions local?

44:03.641 --> 44:06.060
A few, um, but you've also got

44:06.143 --> 44:09.271
this serious Rust Belt wave happening.

44:10.064 --> 44:12.858
Well, tease me some names,
just for a high.

44:12.941 --> 44:17.154
Uh, DeGroot, Bedwell, Militti, Findley.

44:19.239 --> 44:20.658
So we're bulletproof.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.368
It's a goddamn coronation.

44:25.621 --> 44:27.039
Is Schafer here?

44:27.122 --> 44:30.376
Yeah, he's downstairs trying his luck
at the blackjack tables.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.799
[crowd cheering]

44:47.518 --> 44:49.061
May I borrow you a sec?

45:02.408 --> 45:04.660
You're gonna wanna make a quiet exit.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.663
[laughs] What are you talking about?

45:08.831 --> 45:11.834
We've instructed our people
in Michigan and Wisconsin

45:12.334 --> 45:14.169
to pull your voting machines.

45:16.672 --> 45:17.923
You can't do that.

45:18.006 --> 45:19.717
It's done.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.427
No, you need me on this board

45:21.510 --> 45:24.596
if you want your foundation
not to die on the fucking vine.

45:24.680 --> 45:28.225
[scoffs] Please, Randall.
Have you looked upstairs?

45:28.308 --> 45:32.730
Oh, you should also know, we've talked
to our very good friends at the FBI.

45:32.813 --> 45:35.691
-[scoffs]
-Our first anti-corruption partnership.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.235
That's just blowback on you, Wendy Byrde.

45:38.318 --> 45:40.279
Oh, we're way ahead of you there.

45:40.362 --> 45:42.489
"Change starts at home."

45:42.573 --> 45:44.616
"Cleaning up our own house."
Yada yada yada.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.118
-[huffs]
-You know the drill.

45:47.119 --> 45:48.662
You don't wanna do this.

45:49.872 --> 45:50.914
Oh, but I do.

45:51.582 --> 45:56.003
Without me, you don't stand a chance
of getting anyone off the SDN list.

I'm well aware.

46:31.663 --> 46:32.873

46:33.373 --> 46:34.249
Transferred.

Let's go.

46:49.932 --> 46:51.850

-Thanks.

-All set?
-Mm.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.503
Are you gonna miss it?

47:23.507 --> 47:24.925
I'll miss the caves.

47:26.385 --> 47:28.554
And the, uh, the crickets maybe.

47:30.389 --> 47:31.974
And I'll miss being close to Buddy.

47:35.018 --> 47:36.436
Are you gonna miss anything?

47:40.023 --> 47:42.901
[sighs] If I'm being honest…

47:46.029 --> 47:47.739
I just can't believe it's over.

[both exhale]

47:55.330 --> 47:56.999
When we get back to Chicago,

47:58.083 --> 48:00.794
will you go to Portillo's with me
for chocolate cake shakes?

48:00.878 --> 48:01.962
[Charlotte chuckles]

48:03.088 --> 48:06.049
-Do you really need to ask me that?
-[chuckles]

48:07.342 --> 48:10.637
Uh, Jack, I'm gonna need
a couple more limes for Jenny.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.806
Now, Jonah. God damn.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.642
You look like
a grown-ass man in that suit.

48:15.726 --> 48:17.561
[chuckling]

48:17.644 --> 48:20.272
You know, there's always
a job for you here if you want it.

48:21.523 --> 48:24.276
I'm actually thinking of going legit.

48:25.110 --> 48:27.613
-[Ruth] Hmm.
-At least until I get through high school.

48:27.696 --> 48:29.156
[bartender] Here you go, Ruth.

48:30.282 --> 48:33.619
Well, that sounds like a plan.

48:43.795 --> 48:46.381
You decided where
you're gonna live in Chicago?

48:46.465 --> 48:49.259
[Wendy] Well, we were talking about
the northern suburbs, but I think--

48:49.343 --> 48:51.845
-[Marty] She's talking about northern--
-There you are.

48:52.888 --> 48:55.349
-Hey.
-[Camila] Congratulations are in order?

48:55.432 --> 48:57.809
-Oh, yeah. Cheers.
-[Camila] To all of us. Yeah.

48:59.269 --> 49:00.562
This is impressive.

49:00.646 --> 49:03.023
-[Wendy] Hmm.
-It's just the beginning.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.486
I'm glad you're here.

49:08.612 --> 49:09.613
[Clare chuckles]

49:09.696 --> 49:13.867
I've been thinking more and more
about the day my son died.

49:15.369 --> 49:17.120
Trying to make sense of it.

49:18.121 --> 49:21.708
Is there anything you can remember
about that day that seemed odd?

49:22.542 --> 49:24.544
[Clare] There's nothing I can think of.

49:25.462 --> 49:27.506
The reason I ask is

49:28.715 --> 49:31.635
that day in your office,
when I brought up my son,

49:33.220 --> 49:34.763
you seemed to get nervous.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.058
Did I?

49:39.226 --> 49:40.686
Well, I wouldn't know why.

49:42.771 --> 49:45.315
-[chuckles]
-You met him that afternoon, yes?

49:45.399 --> 49:46.858
[Clare] Uh, the morning.

49:48.276 --> 49:52.614
He called me that night, and he said
he had made a deal for the stock options.

49:53.824 --> 49:56.702
That's right.
I needed some time to think about it,

49:56.785 --> 49:58.912
and-- and we spoke
on the phone that night.

50:01.415 --> 50:03.000
Where were you that night?

50:04.418 --> 50:07.713
I had dinner with Marty and Wendy,
and then I went home.

50:09.756 --> 50:11.967
So you called him after your dinner?

50:12.050 --> 50:13.010
[Clare] That's right.

50:14.761 --> 50:17.222
'Cause he made it seem
as if he was going to see you.

50:18.598 --> 50:20.559
No, no, it was much too late.

50:21.351 --> 50:22.894
You're saying he was lying?

50:22.978 --> 50:25.856
[Clare] Of course not. It just
sounds like it was a miscommunication.

50:25.939 --> 50:27.190
Right.

50:28.316 --> 50:29.276
[huffs]

50:30.736 --> 50:32.279
Hear me very clearly.

50:34.865 --> 50:38.910
I'm about to take over for my brother.
You know our business.

50:40.662 --> 50:43.415
I suppose
this must be frightening for you.

50:45.751 --> 50:49.212
If you know something
about the day my son died

50:50.672 --> 50:52.215
that you haven't told me,

50:53.925 --> 50:57.512
I will forgive you this one time.

I'll have someone slash you
from your cunt to your chin.

51:28.543 --> 51:29.711
It was Ruth Langmore.

51:32.756 --> 51:35.550

51:37.385 --> 51:38.804
[Clare] Javi killed her cousin.

51:39.304 --> 51:42.099
She followed him to my office,
and she shot him.

51:43.058 --> 51:43.892
I'm sorry.

51:44.893 --> 51:47.729
I didn't know what to do. I had my--

51:49.022 --> 51:51.858
[clears throat] I had my head of security
take care of the body.

-Did you know?

-I didn't tell anyone.
-Of course not.

51:57.155 --> 51:59.449
[Clare] I was terrified. I was--

52:00.951 --> 52:02.661
I was sure I would be killed.

52:23.890 --> 52:25.809
You're close to that girl.

52:36.444 --> 52:38.280
You see that blonde in the bar?

52:41.867 --> 52:43.285
If you warn her,

52:44.995 --> 52:48.456
if I even sense someone's following me…

52:52.043 --> 52:53.753
I'll kill all of you.

Not gonna matter. They're moving
Navarro tonight. He's not gonna survive.

54:20.465 --> 54:23.301

We ask them to cancel the transfer.

54:24.177 --> 54:25.095
Okay, and then what?

54:25.178 --> 54:28.223
