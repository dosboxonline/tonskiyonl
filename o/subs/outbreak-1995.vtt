of real time. What day is it?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.322
-Sunday.
-And what day did you say you'd be home?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.199
-Friday.
-Thursday, Sam.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.992
I said Thursday. I meant Thursday.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.412

sound so much alike, even I confuse them.

buy a toaster, treat myself...

...and maybe on Sunday
have a day of rest.

won't get in till 7.

52:54.379 --> 52:58.424
This one is the one we got
from Jimbo Scott, the one from Zaire.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.551
This new one

ROBBY: The spikes here and here.
SALT: Yes.

53:13.356 --> 53:17.151
The protein code has changed,
which allows it to survive longer in the air.

originated with Seward...

53:26.953 --> 53:31.457
He's a medical worker. He was sprayed
with a blood sample taken from Alvarez.

53:31.625 --> 53:33.584
And Alvarez tells us what?

53:33.752 --> 53:35.961
Zip, he was dead before we got here.
But listen.

53:36.129 --> 53:38.047
Alvarez died of the original strain.

53:38.215 --> 53:39.632
Seward died of the new strain.

53:39.799 --> 53:43.802
These are too close together on the tree
for the virus to spontaneously mutate...

53:43.970 --> 53:45.512
...so I think...

53:45.931 --> 53:49.808
...that the host animal
is carrying both strains.

53:50.477 --> 53:53.395
Pretty good. Pretty good.
Alvarez, Jimbo, what's the connection?

-Wait a minute.

-Alvarez worked at a pet store.
-I'm just learning this now?

We just got it, Sam.

54:00.403 --> 54:04.657

then it's carrying antibodies to both strains.

BRIGGS: Certainly, sir.

01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:26.106
Out into the field.

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:29.150
This way, folks. One straight line.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.237
MAN 3 [OVER LOUDSPEAKER]:
You will be given paperwork to complete.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.906
Stay in the tent
to which you are assigned.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:36.908
We'll keep you informed.

01:06:37.451 --> 01:06:42.080
You'll be allowed to contact
your families as soon as possible.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:50.755
Do not leave the tent
to which you are assigned.

01:06:58.097 --> 01:06:59.305
RUIZ:
No.

01:06:59.473 --> 01:07:02.350
No animals have been removed
from here for the last 14 days.

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:06.938
I double-checked the storage lists,
the manifests, the vet profiles. Nothing.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:11.067
Talk to every single employee. Every one.
Somebody's got to know something.

01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:13.820
The source of this whole mess is there.

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:17.365
The host is there, Casey.
He didn't talk to everyone. You said he did.

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.075
-Sam.
-This coffee sucks.

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:21.911
-Why don't you try to get a little sleep.
-Why don't you?

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:24.372
-I slept back in July.
-Well, I got work to do.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:28.793
Don't tell me when I need sleep, Casey.
I don't tell you when you need sleep.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.818
[AIR HISSING]

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.180
What happened, Casey?

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:26.850
Oh, nothing.
I just got a sudden case of the willies.

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:28.853
You okay? I can finish up.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:33.983
No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just--
You know, I hate them willies, you know?

01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:36.861
They ought to call them "the Sams,"
don't you think?

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.697
You're tired, huh?

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.658
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.665
McCLINTOCK: The most optimistic projection
USAMRIID is willing to make...

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:52.001
...for the spread of the virus is this:
24 hours...

01:08:52.169 --> 01:08:54.170
...36 hours...

01:08:54.337 --> 01:08:56.256
...48 hours.

01:08:56.423 --> 01:08:59.216
The curtailment procedure
must be viewed objectively.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:03.720
Be compassionate,
but be compassionate globally.

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.348
Thank you.

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.475
All right, all right. Please. Please.

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:12.104
The President's ETA from the East Asia
Economic Summit is in 20 hours.

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:14.566
He wants a recommendation by then
from this group.

01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:17.819
As I understand it, you want to firebomb
the town of Cedar Creek...

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:21.447
...population 2600,
with something called a fuel-air bomb...

01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:24.158
...the most powerful non-nuclear weapon
in our arsenal.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:28.453
The way it works, it explodes,
sucks in all available oxygen to the core...

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:33.667
...vaporizes everything within a mile: men,
women, children and one airborne virus.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:37.714
Destruction complete, case closed,
crisis over.

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:42.426
This Constitution of the United States,
I've read it cover to cover.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:46.430
I don't find anything in it
about vaporizing 2600 American citizens.

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:49.184
But it does say, several times...

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:53.438
...that "no person shall be deprived of life,
liberty or property...

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:54.856
...without due process."

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:59.611
So couple things before Clean Sweep
is even considered:

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:00.862
One...

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.073
...unanimous, unwavering support
for the president on this one.

01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:06.910
And I mean public.
Stand shoulder to shoulder with him.

01:10:07.077 --> 01:10:09.120
He goes down, you go down!

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:10.622
And the second thing is...

01:10:10.789 --> 01:10:14.667
...I want an army of experts citing hundreds
and thousands of lab experiments...

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:18.713
...telling any idiot with a camera
that there was no other way!

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.548
You got that?

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:24.886
No member of this government is gonna go
sneaking off to the Washington Post...

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:28.139
...telling them how
they were the sole voice of opposition.

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:33.311
If there is a voice of opposition out there,
I want him in here. Now.

01:10:34.146 --> 01:10:36.731
Those are the citizens of Cedar Creek.

01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:41.277
Go on! Look at them! These are not
statistics, ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:43.696
They're flesh and blood!

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:46.866
And I want you to burn those
into your memories.

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:51.829
Because those images should haunt us
till the day we die.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:30.595
1918. Remember your history, Donny?
The great influenza pandemic.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:34.599
Circled the globe in nine months.
Killed 25 million people.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:37.769
My father lost three brothers in that. So?

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:42.482
What if there were men who could
have stopped it, only they didn't?

01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:44.776
How do you think history
would judge such men?

01:12:44.943 --> 01:12:46.402
Oh, baloney.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:50.615
FDR stopped Stilwell going into Indochina.
He caused the Vietnam War.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.116
What's history say about him?

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:56.454
Truman dropped the bomb on the Japanese.
Saved thousands of American lives.

01:12:56.955 --> 01:13:01.376
Now your revisionist historians say he
dropped that bomb to scare the Russians.

01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:04.629
Those men were at war, Donny.
We're not.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:07.465
We are at war, Billy. Everybody is at war.

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:11.219
I have a presidential green light
on Operation Clean Sweep...

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.055
...and I am going forward.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.807
Donny...

01:13:17.142 --> 01:13:19.811
...these people are Americans.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:24.690
Twenty-six hundred
dead or dying Americans.

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:30.696
If that bug gets out of there, Billy,
260 million Americans will be dead or dying.

01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:34.409
Those people are casualties of war, Billy.

01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:38.037
I would give them all a medal if I could...

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:41.666
...but they are casualties of war.

01:13:48.632 --> 01:13:51.717
That'll be all, Joe. Come on.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:56.931
RUIZ: Neil, is it?
NEIL: Yes, sir.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.725
I have to ask you a few questions.
Have a seat.

01:13:59.893 --> 01:14:01.477
Okay.

01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:05.648
SAM:
Jimbo, Jimbo, Jimbo, how did he get it?

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:10.611
You know, maybe we're on the wrong track.
Maybe Alice gave it to him.

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:14.031
No, his tissue sample showed twice
the viral amplification of Alice's.

01:14:14.199 --> 01:14:16.534
-So we're stuck.
-We're doing the best we can, Sam.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:20.037
No we're not. We're not.

01:14:20.205 --> 01:14:22.874
Look, let's wait
for the comprehensive results to come in.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:24.542
-Just--
-Robby.

01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:28.671
-Yeah?
-Can I ask you a personal question?

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.175
What did you do with the dogs?

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:34.719
God.

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:37.013
Please don't tell me
you put them in a kennel.

01:14:37.389 --> 01:14:40.892
Think I tied them to a tree and left
a five-pound bag of dog chow nearby?

01:14:41.059 --> 01:14:46.063
-That's what you did when you left me.
-Sam, we're gonna start over, okay?

01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:50.651
It's Alvarez, Jimbo, Biotest.

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:51.903
Jesus.

01:14:52.404 --> 01:14:53.905
Look.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.916
Guys, guys, the monkey. Turn around.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:08.753
SALT: Oh, my sweet Jesus.
He should be dead by now.

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:13.257
-I guess the orange juice worked.
SAM: It doesn't work on humans.

01:15:13.425 --> 01:15:15.927
No, it doesn't on
Cedar Creek Motaba, Sam.

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:18.387
This monkey
was infected with the original strain.

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:21.432
You're right.
And do you know what that means?

01:15:22.142 --> 01:15:25.436
This is no experimental antiserum.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.275
E-1101
was designed to kill African Motaba.

01:15:33.445 --> 01:15:36.072
And they had it all the time.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:44.747
Casey!

01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:46.123
Casey, come on, buddy!

01:15:46.291 --> 01:15:47.875
Salt! How's his breathing?

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.794
He's gonna arrest!

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.551
MAN:
We need blood, fluid, oxygen, ice, now!

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:57.760
ROBBY:
Come on, Casey.

01:15:57.928 --> 01:16:00.471
SAM: Let's go. Put it in his armpits.
-Come on, Case.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:02.056
I need to get in there.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.641
-Under his armpits.
ROBBY: Pressure.

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:06.435
-I need his arm.
SAM: Give me his temperature.

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:08.312
I need pressure.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.982
-Tell me what his temperature is.
WOMAN: 106!

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:14.318
We need suction!
We need more ice, now!

01:16:14.486 --> 01:16:16.404
Okay, Casey. Let me in here. Come on.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.614
You slept long enough. Come on.
Come on.

01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:20.616
Open your eyes! Open! Open! Open!

01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:23.494
Open! Open! Open! Look at me.
Look at me.

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:25.913
Casey, right here. Here I am, here I am.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.832
Here I am. See me? There you are.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:31.335
There you are. How you doing?

01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:35.172
I had a wonderful dream, Auntie Em.

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:36.716
Yeah?

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:39.176
You were there. You were there.

01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:40.595
Stay here. Stay with me.

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:45.016
Yeah, you were there too. You had about
106 fever. We're going to take you down.

01:16:45.183 --> 01:16:47.184
Stay with me.
Come on, don't fuck around.

01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:50.021
How many brain cells did I kill?

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:53.149
How many? About a billion.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.819
Now I'm only as smart as you.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.947
What can we give him
to kill his sense of humor?

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:04.035
We gotta get a line!
We gotta get a line!

01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:05.369
Hold him. Hold him.

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:07.038
-Hold his head!
WOMAN: I got it.

01:17:07.205 --> 01:17:09.707
What? What? Talk to me. What?

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:15.630
It didn't get past the outer glove.
Just hold him down and give him a line.

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:17.006
What do you mean?

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:21.052
Come here.

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:50.289
I was with him.
I should've known something was wrong.

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.083
-Maybe it didn't puncture.
-It did.

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.502
-Let me see.
-It did, Sam.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:57.463
-Okay, let me get some iodine on it.
-I did that already.

01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:00.299
-We'll get it.
-I did it, Sam!

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:01.884
Oh, God.

01:18:02.052 --> 01:18:05.262
Oh, God, I know how
to work with needles. I just....

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.889
-Why didn't I wait?
SAM: Robby.

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:09.433
-Okay, listen to me.
-Sam, not now, okay? Not now.

01:18:09.601 --> 01:18:10.935
-Robby!
-What?

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:14.105
-Listen to me!
-There's nothing to say, Sam.

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:18.693
There is.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:25.616
MAN:
Watch it.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:43.592
Yes, Sam?

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:48.264
You knew about Motaba all along.
E-1101 was the antiserum.

01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:53.394
You could've stopped this outbreak
before it mutated. But you didn't.

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.229
-We couldn't.
-We?

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.439
-We.
-We?

01:18:56.606 --> 01:19:00.443
-We. That's all you need to know.
-No, you gotta tell me what the host is.

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:04.029
We never found the host.
We had to synthesize the antiserum.

01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:08.617
Sure. To protect the troops. But now
the virus comes here and two kids die.

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:10.244
We could've stopped it then...

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:14.498
...but we don't because we have to
protect the perfect biological weapon.

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:18.836
But then the virus mutates and we can't
stop it now and we could've then.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:24.550
The decision was made
in the interest of national security.

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:28.179
At the time, it was felt that we could afford
a certain number of losses.

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:29.847
Robby's infected.

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:33.851
I'm sorry.

01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:36.437
Is "we" sorry too?

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:44.445
Billy, "we" is responsible
for a town dying.

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:47.281
"We" is a party to Casey dying.

01:19:48.241 --> 01:19:50.201
My wife is dying.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.704
Isnâ€™t she your ex-wife, Sam?

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:58.876
I'm sorry. What's your point?

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:02.338
My point is your penchant
for distorting the facts.

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:05.424
You and Robby are, in fact, divorced.

01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:07.676
Who is "we"?

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:09.804
"We" includes you, Sam.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:12.723
Unless you resigned from the Army
the last week.

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:16.435
You don't just do research
and it ends there, Sam.

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:19.230
We have to defend ourselves
against the other maniacs...

01:20:19.397 --> 01:20:21.524
...who are developing biological weapons.

01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:23.567
That's the way the game is played.

01:20:23.735 --> 01:20:26.737
Yes, it was a terrible mistake
to withhold E-1101...

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:29.073
...but we're beyond that now.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:32.034
We've done all we can as doctors.

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:34.662
We have to go on...

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:36.747
...as soldiers.

01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:42.378
You're gonna wipe out the town.

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:47.049
You're gonna eradicate the mutation
and then your weapon is intact.

01:20:47.217 --> 01:20:50.511
That's why the troops
are moving out, right, Billy?

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.721
It's already been ordered.

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:55.057
When is it, Billy?

01:20:56.059 --> 01:20:57.518
2000 hours.

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.603

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:02.565
What do you mean, the president?

01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:04.233
He was shown the projections.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:06.652
He was advised
by an expert panel of virologists.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.529
I wasn't there.

01:21:09.447 --> 01:21:11.448
It's not about a weapon, Sam.

01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:13.742
When the president saw
that within 48 hours...

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:17.997
...this virus could be crawling across
the White House lawn, he gave the order.

01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:19.707
I wasn't invited.

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:23.794
Suppose you had been, Sam...

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.047

-...Ruiz called.
-Yeah?

01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:38.559
Apparently he scared a security guard
into telling him Jimbo Scott...

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.644
...smuggled an animal out of Biotest.

01:21:40.812 --> 01:21:43.981
-Jesus. What kind of animal?
-He couldn't say.

to fit in the back seat of a car.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:51.780
Colonel, we do know it came in on a ship
from Africa around September 1st.

01:21:51.948 --> 01:21:53.824
It's something at least,
maybe it's enough

-A monkey? I could tell.
-I'm feeding her, see?

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:29.511
-She lives in the woods.
-Do a lot of monkeys live in the woods?

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:33.056
No, just Betsy. She comes to visit me.

01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:37.436
Does Betsy like apples

01:43:33.123 --> 01:43:36.000
Your orders are to accompany me
to Travis Air Force Base. Over.

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:39.045
General, you don't understand,
there's nobody sick at Travis.

01:43:39.213 --> 01:43:41.881
McCLINTOCK: Don't make this difficult
for me, Colonel Daniels.

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:45.551
They're lining up in attack formation.
They don't want us anywhere but down.

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:49.764
I don't think you want to destroy an Army
helicopter over California in broad daylight.

01:43:49.932 --> 01:43:53.851
With all due respect, colonel, if you do not
follow us to Travis Air Force Base...

01:43:54.019 --> 01:43:55.811
...I will blow you out of the sky.

01:43:55.979 --> 01:43:59.815
General, with all due respect,
fuck you, sir.

01:44:01.777 --> 01:44:04.820
Under my authority, go weapons hot.

01:44:04.988 --> 01:44:07.657
Viper 2, This is General McClintock.

01:44:07.824 --> 01:44:09.867
Go weapons hot.

01:44:17.209 --> 01:44:20.044
Hold on, colonel. We're going low.

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:29.428
-Anything I can do to help?
-Just don't make me nervous.

01:44:38.355 --> 01:44:42.149
The river bends to the right. We've gotta
cut them off. Viper 2, break right.

01:44:42.317 --> 01:44:44.026
MAN:
Two, breaking right.

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.160
I don't see them back there.
I think we lost them.

01:44:56.665 --> 01:44:58.541
Oh, shit. Hang on colonel.

01:45:01.378 --> 01:45:03.337
Two is masked. No shot, no shot.

01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:09.552
SALT: See that bridge up ahead, colonel?
-Yes.

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:10.886
Over or under, sir?

01:45:11.054 --> 01:45:13.472
Why don't you decide,
I'm really not up to it, I'm--

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.017
-Hang on.
-I would have said over.

01:45:16.184 --> 01:45:18.060
Wires, wires. Two is off left.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:21.564
PILOT: What should I do, sir?
-Just stay on him, get him out of the air.

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:27.570
Don't go under the bridge!

01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:39.040
-You're missing him.
-Fuck.

01:45:39.207 --> 01:45:40.916
PILOT: Go into it.
McCLINTOCK: You're missing him.

01:45:41.251 --> 01:45:42.585
Hang on, colonel.

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:53.596
Whoo-hoo!

01:45:55.265 --> 01:45:57.016
That's it, sir. That's it. We got it.

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.435
-If you're in trouble, I want to know.
-Hang on.

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:19.121
Salt, you gotta warn me
before you pull a stunt like that again.

01:46:19.289 --> 01:46:22.541
SALT: I didn't know I was gonna do it
until it was done, sir.

01:46:22.959 --> 01:46:24.710
Viper 2, where are the hell are you?

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:27.129
MAN:
Lead, Viper 2 closing in on you now.

01:46:27.297 --> 01:46:30.716
He just pulled a 180,
he's coming right back at you.

01:46:37.808 --> 01:46:40.935
Viper Lead, they're coming straight at us.
I'm going weapons hot.

01:46:41.103 --> 01:46:43.104
-Holy shit! Break, break!
-Break now!

01:46:50.445 --> 01:46:53.489
McCLINTOCK: Where's he gone?
-I don't know, sir.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.493
Son of a bitch. He did that on purpose.

01:46:58.620 --> 01:46:59.662
SAM: Salt.
SALT: Yes, sir.

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:02.373
-Are those rockets on the side of this thing?
-They are.

01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:04.583
Fire a couple into those trees.

01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:17.346
Hey, look there.

01:47:17.514 --> 01:47:20.516
Lead,
we got fire in the trees at 2 o'clock.

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:21.851
Verify.

01:47:22.018 --> 01:47:25.563
Viper 2, Lead. Can you get down there
and search for wreckage?

01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:28.691
MAN 1: Lead, Two.
Negative. It's too thick down there.

01:47:29.234 --> 01:47:32.903
Big Eye, Viper. We think the Loach is down.
What do you see?

01:47:33.071 --> 01:47:35.573
MAN 2: Viper, we had three contacts
and then an explosion.

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:37.199
Now we've only got two.

01:47:37.367 --> 01:47:40.286
Everything else is ground clutter
on the highway. Over.

01:47:40.996 --> 01:47:43.038
Flying a little low, aren't we, Salt?

01:47:43.498 --> 01:47:45.708
SALT:
Avoiding radar, sir.

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.713
SAM:
She's still out. How you doing, Betsy?

01:47:51.214 --> 01:47:52.256
-Salt.
-Sir.

01:47:52.424 --> 01:47:54.800
Use the E-1101 as a map
to synthesize an antiserum.

01:47:54.968 --> 01:47:57.470
-I'll get right on it.
-Got an awful lot of people here.

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:59.763
SALT: I'll copy it big time.
SAM: I want liters of it.

01:47:59.931 --> 01:48:00.931
SALT:
Yes, sir.

01:48:01.099 --> 01:48:02.933
SAM: I want everything
in place if Robby responds.

01:48:03.101 --> 01:48:04.226
-You got it?
SALT: Yes, sir.

01:48:04.394 --> 01:48:05.561
SAM:
Okay.

01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:27.917
PILOT:
Sir, there's no sign of wreckage.

01:48:28.084 --> 01:48:30.127
We've been decoyed.

01:48:31.421 --> 01:48:33.797
You son of a bitch.

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:03.953
How are you doing, kid?

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:07.373
Sam.

01:49:09.459 --> 01:49:12.127
You're gonna be okay.
We found the host.

01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:16.632
You don't have to say that, Sam.

01:49:17.133 --> 01:49:18.968
No, it's true.

01:49:19.135 --> 01:49:20.636
Would I kid you?

01:49:20.804 --> 01:49:22.930
Salt's cooking up the good stuff.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.933
So let's hang out for a while.

01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:30.521
-Sam.
-Okay?

01:49:35.527 --> 01:49:37.945
I love your face.

01:49:48.456 --> 01:49:50.332
Keep talking to me, Robby.

01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.794
Robby. Robby. Robby.

01:49:53.962 --> 01:49:56.463
Please don't leave me, Robby.

01:50:11.062 --> 01:50:12.521
Sam...

01:50:12.689 --> 01:50:14.440
...don't.

01:50:16.651 --> 01:50:18.694
Sam.

01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:29.830
Sam, don't. No.

01:50:39.382 --> 01:50:41.467
Sam.

01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:43.469
It's okay.

01:50:53.688 --> 01:50:56.023
Colonel, I got it.

01:50:56.191 --> 01:50:58.901
-Your helmet.
-Come on, come on, put it up.

01:50:59.069 --> 01:51:00.569
We got it.

01:51:00.779 --> 01:51:02.529
Okay. You ready?

01:51:03.406 --> 01:51:05.532
-Say when.
-Now.

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:07.076
I got it. I got it.

01:51:07.243 --> 01:51:08.911
-Get the lab geared up.
-Yes, sir.

01:51:09.079 --> 01:51:10.829
Make more, we got a town waiting.

01:51:10.997 --> 01:51:14.667
-It's gonna work, sir.
-Go, go. Come on. The time's now.

01:51:16.878 --> 01:51:19.838
You delayed the bombing.
That more of your sentimental bullshit?

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:23.175
For God's sake, Donnie,
there's a chance we can save these people.

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:26.428
You're nuts.
Sandman 1, Viper 1. How copy? Over.

01:51:26.596 --> 01:51:28.764
MAN: Viper 1, Sandman 1.
Send your traffic. Over.

01:51:28.932 --> 01:51:30.766
We had the antiserum and didn't use it.

01:51:30.934 --> 01:51:33.602
-Don't you think that's gonna come out?
-I can defend that.

01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:35.979
It's not about
saving our asses anymore, Donnie.

01:51:36.147 --> 01:51:39.191
You are to proceed immediately
with Operation Clean Sweep.

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:41.026
Is that understood? Over.

01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:44.279
Daniels knows about the African camp.

01:51:44.781 --> 01:51:47.574
MAN: Roger, Viper.
Sandman is proceeding. Out.

01:52:35.039 --> 01:52:36.749
Salt. Her temperature's coming down.

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:40.210
-It's working, she's normalizing. Come here.
-But, sir, they're coming.

01:52:40.378 --> 01:52:43.338
I picked up a transmission.
The plane is in the air.

01:52:43.506 --> 01:52:45.591
They're coming, colonel.

01:52:45.967 --> 01:52:47.426
Come on.

01:52:47.677 --> 01:52:50.888
SALT: Where are we going?
-Come on. Come on!

01:52:52.015 --> 01:52:54.475
SALT: Where are we going?
-Gotta get through to the pilot.

01:52:54.642 --> 01:52:56.268
-Can you do it?
SALT: Yes. Guard channel.

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:57.561
Every aircraft has it.

01:52:57.729 --> 01:52:59.855
SAM: All right, get this thing up.
SALT: Where are we going?

01:53:00.023 --> 01:53:01.523
SAM:
I don't know. Get us in the air.

01:53:01.691 --> 01:53:04.610
Shouldn't we contact the command center?
We have the antiserum.

01:53:04.778 --> 01:53:07.362
-Don't care. They want to bury the town.
-This is crazy.

01:53:07.530 --> 01:53:09.698
-They want their weapon.
-Kill all those people?

01:53:09.866 --> 01:53:12.701
-They want their weapon.
-Sit and watch all those people die?

01:53:12.869 --> 01:53:15.037
Yes, they want their weapon.

01:53:15.872 --> 01:53:17.414
No.

01:53:29.844 --> 01:53:33.555
Viper, Sandman. We are at
the IP commencing bomb run now.

01:53:33.723 --> 01:53:35.557
Three minutes to target area. Over.

01:53:35.725 --> 01:53:38.227
Sandman, Viper Command.
Bomb release is go.

01:53:38.394 --> 01:53:41.396
I say again, bomb release is go. Over.

01:53:43.817 --> 01:53:45.567
SALT:
Where are we going? What are we doing?

01:53:45.735 --> 01:53:48.278
Get me on the Guard channel,
I wanna talk to the pilot.

01:53:48.446 --> 01:53:50.697
-Go.
-To the aircraft approaching Cedar Creek...

01:53:50.865 --> 01:53:53.534
...this is Colonel Sam Daniels,
a doctor with USAMRIID.

01:53:53.701 --> 01:53:56.411
-Do you read me?
-We read you. Over.

01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:01.542
Okay. You must not bomb this town.

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:03.418
I repeat, do not drop the bomb.

01:54:03.586 --> 01:54:06.171
-We have produced an antiserum....
-That son of a bitch.

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:09.216
Sandman, Viper Command.
You're being spoofed by com chatter.

01:54:09.384 --> 01:54:12.135
-Charlie Mike, over.
-Viper Command, Sandman.

01:54:12.303 --> 01:54:14.596
Authenticate Hotel Alpha. Over.

01:54:14.764 --> 01:54:18.100
Sandman, this is Viper Command.
I authenticate...

01:54:18.268 --> 01:54:19.268
...Juliette, over.

01:54:19.435 --> 01:54:22.521
SAM: Unfortunately, your commanders
do not have the current data. We do.

01:54:22.689 --> 01:54:25.941
We have an antiserum.
As we speak, it's being administered.

01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:29.444
Every infected person within
a matter of hours will have their dosage...

01:54:29.612 --> 01:54:31.113
...you must abort the mission.

01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:33.699
This is urgent.
Answer me. Do you read me?

01:54:34.117 --> 01:54:37.578
You cannot bomb this town.
You must abort.

01:54:37.745 --> 01:54:41.957
I am talking to the pilots in the bomber.
Do you read me?

01:54:43.293 --> 01:54:44.793
Do you read me?

01:54:44.961 --> 01:54:46.712
-Where is he, Briggs?
SAM: Can you hear me?

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.173
Can he prevent the bombing?
Can he cause them to abort their run?

01:54:50.341 --> 01:54:52.467
If he gets in the way
of that inbound aircraft.

01:54:52.635 --> 01:54:55.846
You get something up in the air
and blow him the Christ out of there!

01:54:56.014 --> 01:54:57.472
-Now.
-Yes sir, major.

01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:01.143
-What have we got in the way of Stingers?
-Can we not stop his transmission?

01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:03.979
SAM:
Do you read me? You must abort.

01:55:04.147 --> 01:55:07.399
They won't answer you, colonel,
they've been trained not to.

01:55:08.151 --> 01:55:09.985
You hear me, don't you, guys?

01:55:11.154 --> 01:55:12.529
I'll say it one last time.

01:55:12.697 --> 01:55:15.574
These people that you're gonna bomb
are not the enemy.

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:19.745
We can kill the virus without killing these
people. And I swear to you on my soul...

01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:22.164
...that the president
does not have the facts.

01:55:22.332 --> 01:55:24.625
He does not know
we have a serum that is working.

01:55:24.792 --> 01:55:27.753
Do you really think
he wants to blow up the town?

01:55:28.504 --> 01:55:31.089
Oh, Christ, guys,
if you think I'm lying, drop the bomb.

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:33.175
If you think I'm crazy, drop the bomb.

01:55:33.343 --> 01:55:36.345
But don't drop the bomb
just because you're following orders.

01:55:36.512 --> 01:55:39.514
What you haven't been told
is your superiors have another agenda.

01:55:39.682 --> 01:55:43.477
Don't you understand that below you in
Cedar Creek, there's a biological weapon...

01:55:43.645 --> 01:55:47.314
...that they've been manufacturing illegally
for the last 30 years?

01:55:47.482 --> 01:55:49.691
Hey, I guarantee you...

01:55:49.859 --> 01:55:53.278
...that the disease has spread
beyond the perimeters of this town.

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:55.572
People, we're in a state
of national emergency.

01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:58.742
SAM: You can't tell me that virus--
-We are under executive orders.

01:55:58.910 --> 01:56:00.702
SAM: --what the serum is.
-See it through.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:04.873
And if you incinerate Cedar Creek,
you incinerate the serum.

01:56:16.052 --> 01:56:18.136
Billy, can you hear me?

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:20.555
Why don't you do something?
Call this thing off

01:56:20.723 --> 01:56:23.308
Don't kill all these people
to protect your lie.

01:56:23.476 --> 01:56:26.979
This is murder, Billy,
any way you fucking slice it.

01:56:27.146 --> 01:56:30.649
If you manipulate the truth, the president,
the country, the Constitution...

01:56:30.817 --> 01:56:35.153
...then it's not just a town you're killing,
it's a big piece of the American soul, sir.

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:37.906
Billy, why aren't you
at Cedar Creek, man?

01:56:38.074 --> 01:56:39.825
Colonel Daniels, this is General Ford.

01:56:40.368 --> 01:56:43.912
I remind you that you are interfering
with presidential authority.

01:56:44.455 --> 01:56:46.915
Sandman has a specific line to the target.

01:56:47.083 --> 01:56:49.876
If you are in his way,
he cannot complete his bombing run...

01:56:50.044 --> 01:56:52.963
...and there will be hell to pay.
Do you understand? Over.

01:56:53.131 --> 01:56:55.590
-Why'd he say that?
-Beats the hell out of me.

01:56:55.758 --> 01:57:01.680
Billy, are you dumb or something?
You just told him how to stop the--

01:57:03.266 --> 01:57:05.767
Okay. Okay.

01:57:05.935 --> 01:57:07.602
Colonel, there it is.

01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:09.521
I see it.

01:57:09.731 --> 01:57:12.774
-Okay, man, you up for this?
-Yes, sir.

01:57:14.318 --> 01:57:17.279
Viper Command, he's over the target area.
Please advise. Over.

01:57:17.447 --> 01:57:20.323
McCLINTOCK: Sandman, Viper Command.
We have final clearance.

01:57:20.491 --> 01:57:22.659
Do not deviate. Over.

01:57:22.827 --> 01:57:26.538
SAM: Guys. I'm talking to the pilots
coming toward us in the bomber.

01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:29.958
I know what you're about to do
doesn't come easy to you, but what...

01:57:30.126 --> 01:57:32.419
...I've been telling you is truth,
so help me God.

01:57:32.587 --> 01:57:35.672
McCLINTOCK: You will release
that weapon on time and on target!

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:39.301
Whatever you do in the next 30 seconds
will be your testimony to life.

01:57:39.469 --> 01:57:42.137
Sandman, Viper Command.
You know what's riding on this.

01:57:42.305 --> 01:57:44.056
Please, try to remain calm.

01:57:44.515 --> 01:57:48.310
SAM: Okay, guys, no more words.
But we're not moving from your path.

01:57:48.478 --> 01:57:52.397
Do you hear us?
I said we're not moving from your path.

01:57:52.565 --> 01:57:55.901
I've never seen anything like this,
I swear to God. Never seen anything.

01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:57.319
Sandman, Viper Command.

01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:00.363
I don't care if you have to
fly through those bastards.

01:58:00.531 --> 01:58:04.493
This is what you've been trained for.
Hold your course and drop. Over.

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:07.162
You'll have to take us out with you.

01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:12.667
We're not moving!

01:58:34.398 --> 01:58:35.649
They're dropping it.

01:59:09.892 --> 01:59:11.643
Thank you, guys.

01:59:14.730 --> 01:59:18.316
Sandman, Viper Command.
How did you release that weapon?

01:59:18.484 --> 01:59:19.526
Over.

01:59:19.694 --> 01:59:23.697
Viper Command, this is Sandman.
We have detonation over the water.

01:59:23.865 --> 01:59:26.575
It might have been wind shear. Over.

01:59:27.201 --> 01:59:30.537
Sandman, you understand
that it is my belief...

01:59:30.705 --> 01:59:33.373
...that you have deliberately
contravened a direct order.

01:59:33.541 --> 01:59:36.585
Now, you return to base
for immediate rearming. Over.

01:59:36.752 --> 01:59:39.087
Give me the microphone, general.

01:59:40.548 --> 01:59:41.882
I beg your pardon, Billy?

01:59:42.049 --> 01:59:44.593
Give me the mike, general.

01:59:50.183 --> 01:59:53.602
Sandman, this is General Ford.
You will ignore that order.

01:59:54.145 --> 01:59:57.939
For the record, I am relieving
General McClintock of command...

01:59:58.816 --> 02:00:02.694
...for withholding vital information
from the president of the United States.

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:06.740
I have in no way withheld vital information
from the president of the United States.

02:00:06.908 --> 02:00:08.575
-Colonel Briggs.
-Sir.

02:00:08.743 --> 02:00:11.620
You will place General McClintock
under arrest.

02:00:13.331 --> 02:00:17.125
If I go down for this, Billy,
you go down for it.

02:00:18.502 --> 02:00:20.629
It's out of our hands now, Donnie.

02:00:22.298 --> 02:00:26.384
You silly, sentimental son of a bitch.

02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:30.805
Nobody puts me under arrest.

02:00:31.641 --> 02:00:33.183
Nobody.

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.105
Colonel Briggs...

02:00:39.273 --> 02:00:42.275
...what a wonderful moment
this must be for you.

02:01:10.137 --> 02:01:12.264
ROBBY:
Sam.

02:01:12.974 --> 02:01:14.307
Yes.

02:01:14.475 --> 02:01:17.310
Boy, that was a good nap, kid.

02:01:17.687 --> 02:01:19.521
You look better.

02:01:20.273 --> 02:01:22.357
The gown becomes you.

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:26.861
-How're they doing on the antiserum?
-Great.

02:01:27.029 --> 02:01:29.281
They're cranking it out by the liter.

02:01:29.448 --> 02:01:31.616
How much are they giving
the contact patients?

02:01:31.784 --> 02:01:32.867
Two-hundred mls.

02:01:36.289 --> 02:01:38.456
Is that what they gave you?

02:01:47.216 --> 02:01:49.718
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:53.513
I didn't think you'd make it.

02:01:54.307 --> 02:01:57.309
It's a pretty unique experience.

02:02:01.397 --> 02:02:03.356
Sort of like living with me.

02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:09.904
Would you go through it again?

02:02:11.407 --> 02:02:13.033
Maybe.

02:02:13.367 --> 02:02:16.077
Now that I have the antibodies.

02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:08.971
