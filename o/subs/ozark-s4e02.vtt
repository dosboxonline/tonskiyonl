["How Lonesome Can I Get" by Durwood
Daily Haddock playing on loudspeakers]

00:14.973 --> 00:17.392
[fluorescent lights buzzing]

00:32.699 --> 00:33.867
[woman] Can I help you?

00:35.535 --> 00:37.829
No, I'm just… lookin'.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.713
Excuse me.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.841
Uh, can I see that one, please?

01:36.513 --> 01:37.722
Okay.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.064
It's perfect.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.652
You don't really think of goats
and cookies together, do you?

01:50.735 --> 01:51.820
[Ruth chuckles]

01:51.903 --> 01:54.572
My husband, he says
it's 'cause they're satanic, goats.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.201
[chuckles] I don't even think
the devil eats cookies, does he?

01:58.284 --> 01:59.327
[Ruth] Hmm.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.664
Maybe he does.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.582
Do you want a bag?

02:06.584 --> 02:07.502
No.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.212
Thank you.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.508
[vendor] You take care of that.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.427
[bugs chirring]

02:28.731 --> 02:30.733
[engine shuts off]

02:32.569 --> 02:34.946
[crow calling]

02:47.542 --> 02:49.544
[breathing shakily]

02:59.637 --> 03:00.972
[sniffles]

03:04.184 --> 03:05.518
[inhales sharply]

03:09.731 --> 03:11.482
[whimpering]

03:11.566 --> 03:13.484
[choking back tears]

03:13.568 --> 03:15.486
[gasping]

03:20.658 --> 03:22.660
[crying softly]

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
[Ruth continues sobbing quietly]

03:33.296 --> 03:34.881
[Ruth sighs]

04:06.496 --> 04:08.498
[ominous music building]

04:08.581 --> 04:09.624
[radio switches on]

04:09.707 --> 04:12.961
[reporter] A young hiker is recovering
after falling nearly 50 feet off…

04:13.044 --> 04:14.712
[knocking on door]

04:23.721 --> 04:24.555
[Marty] Hi.

04:25.932 --> 04:26.766
Hi.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.436
Thank you.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.815
They never tell you how useful they are.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.901
I think the Internet told everyone.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.487
Oh. Oh, I see, well,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.240
you still don't have enough, trust me.

04:42.323 --> 04:46.119
-[baby cooing]
-Hey, there he is.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.539
That's a handsome dude.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.165
You got a name for him?

04:51.249 --> 04:52.125
Wilson.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.085
Wilson. Great.

04:54.585 --> 04:55.795
Grandfather's.

04:55.878 --> 04:56.713
Yeah?

04:59.382 --> 05:01.050
What are you doing here, Marty?

05:03.177 --> 05:05.763
Well, uh, you never called me back, so…

05:05.847 --> 05:09.392
Well, after 20 voicemails,

05:09.475 --> 05:11.978
I pieced it together you were still alive.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.189
So what's so important
you're in my living room

05:15.273 --> 05:17.442
eight days after I give birth?

05:18.693 --> 05:22.864
Uh, what are the steps for making a deal
with a cooperating witness?

05:23.364 --> 05:26.743
That's what you want to be now?
It's a little late in the day.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.454
[Wilson cooing]

05:31.331 --> 05:32.415
It's not me.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.465
No.

05:42.216 --> 05:43.468
Yeah, he wants out.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.556
Omar Navarro wants
to cut a deal with the FBI?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.099
Mm-hmm.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.020
Why now? He's winning the war.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.773
And it almost cost him his whole family.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.942
Mortality's catching up with him, I guess.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.363
What does he want?

06:03.446 --> 06:04.739
He wants no prosecution,

06:04.822 --> 06:07.241
and he wants, you know,
freedom of movement

06:07.325 --> 06:09.202
-between Mexico and the US.
-[scoffing]

06:09.285 --> 06:10.661
I know it. Um…

06:12.830 --> 06:15.625
-What would it take?
-[suspenseful music builds]

06:16.209 --> 06:17.960
More than he's willing to give.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.256
Huge bust, big names taken down.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.841
He needs to do time.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.803
I'm not going to my bosses with,

06:26.886 --> 06:30.139
"Hey, a mass-murdering
cartel leader would like a pass, please."

06:31.349 --> 06:33.101
Yeah, I understand.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.437
Um… let me talk to him.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.360
He's very serious about this, though.

06:44.028 --> 06:47.031
You all are if you still think
you won't have to pay for it.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.342
[papers rustling]

07:22.150 --> 07:23.276
Charlotte?

07:24.318 --> 07:25.570
Charlotte?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.574
Where's Ben?

07:30.700 --> 07:31.868
Where's the box?

07:31.951 --> 07:32.994
[Charlotte] Uh…

07:33.953 --> 07:36.664
I-- I don't know. It-- It was right there.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.084
[scoffs] Maybe Jonah took it.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.219
[video game sounds playing]

07:50.303 --> 07:51.596
Hey, where's Ben?

07:51.679 --> 07:53.055
[video game explosion]

07:53.139 --> 07:55.349
Have you seen his ashes?
Did you move them?

07:56.559 --> 07:58.478
[electronic zapping continues]

07:58.561 --> 07:59.437
[sternly] Jonah.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.606
Answer me.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.651
I gave them to Ruth.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.323
[breathily] You did what?

08:12.700 --> 08:13.743
She loved him.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.912
She'll keep him safe.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.125
[video game explosions resume]

08:30.927 --> 08:31.928
[door slams]

08:32.428 --> 08:35.681
[electronic zapping]

08:42.271 --> 08:44.273
[car brakes hiss]

08:45.733 --> 08:46.984
[Wendy shouting] Ruth!

08:47.485 --> 08:48.486
[car door slams]

08:49.570 --> 08:50.571
Ruth!

08:51.447 --> 08:53.991
I know you're home!
Get the fuck out here!

08:55.284 --> 08:58.704
Your sister's got
a real loud mouth on her…

09:00.331 --> 09:01.541
Ruth!

09:01.624 --> 09:03.000
[exhales deeply]

09:10.383 --> 09:11.425
[gun cocks]

09:15.638 --> 09:18.766
If you did anything to Ben's ashes,
I swear to God…

09:21.769 --> 09:22.895
They're fine.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.275
Then give them back.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.110
They belong to me.

09:29.819 --> 09:35.199
[Ruth] Well… I promised Jonah
I'd take care of them.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.995
If you want them back,
he's going to have to say so.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.621
Now get the fuck out of here.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.459
He didn't love you, Ruth!

09:46.085 --> 09:47.420
He was sick!

09:48.588 --> 09:51.507
You were just next in a long line

09:51.591 --> 09:55.303
of broken, bad-tempered women
he could obsess over.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.513
He would have been done in a month.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.056
[melancholic music playing]

09:59.140 --> 10:00.224
[scoffs softly]

10:02.268 --> 10:03.352
[sarcastically] Yeah.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.358
If you hadn't killed him first.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.117
[slams]

10:22.830 --> 10:24.290
[sighs seethingly]

10:31.380 --> 10:34.342
[Omar in Spanish] It has been
five days since my last confession.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.803
-I took the Lord's name in vain.
-[engine turns over]

10:39.347 --> 10:41.265
Three times that I remember.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.602
I kicked Silvia's dog.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.190
I was short-tempered with my children.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.983
Rafael especially.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.278
-[sighs quietly]
-[priest grunts]

10:54.362 --> 10:58.115
[in Spanish] Bon-Bon is
too small to be kicked.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.202
Yes. But Silvia lets her in my office.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.204
She gets under my feet.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.706
-[priest] So pick her up.
-[sighs]

11:05.790 --> 11:09.001
[priest] She's a good dog.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.379
I'll try.

11:12.922 --> 11:17.760
And… apologize to Rafael.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.305
He'll learn more from that
than your anger.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.349
My anger makes him strong.

11:23.974 --> 11:27.103
[priest] And shortens his childhood.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.397
Let him have it a little longer.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.358
[phone buzzing]

11:33.484 --> 11:35.361
[Omar exhales heavily]

11:35.444 --> 11:37.863
I have to return this.

11:39.490 --> 11:44.704
[praying] I am sorry
for having offended thee, my God.

11:44.787 --> 11:49.667
I detest my sins because they offend you.

11:49.750 --> 11:53.087
I resolve, with thy grace, to do penance

11:53.170 --> 11:56.465
and avoid the near occasion of sin.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.218
In the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost

11:59.301 --> 12:01.512
I absolve you of these sins.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.182
[kisses]

12:06.100 --> 12:07.685
[priest] Any other confessions?

12:17.027 --> 12:20.698
[Omar inhales and exhales deeply]

12:23.659 --> 12:24.493
No.

12:29.498 --> 12:30.750
[store door dings]

12:31.333 --> 12:33.335
[phone ringing]

12:36.756 --> 12:37.840
Hello.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.049
[Omar] Well?

12:39.133 --> 12:42.720
Uh, she's interested. She just is gonna
need to know that you're serious.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.722
Tell me what she said, exactly.

12:44.805 --> 12:45.931
Um…

12:46.015 --> 12:48.893
[clicks tongue] Well, she--
she-- she mentioned prison,

12:48.976 --> 12:52.313
but I think that if you make a list
of everything you'd be willing to give,

12:52.396 --> 12:54.148
-there's probably a--
-No.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.399
No list.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.361
I want to meet her.

13:00.404 --> 13:05.284
Uh… you can't make a--
a handshake deal with a single agent.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.537
She's gonna need to go
to her bosses with a real offer.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.207
You said you had her, Marty.
Were you lying to me?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.501
Make it happen.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.211
[phone line disconnects]

13:24.845 --> 13:26.889
-[in Spanish] Was that Marty Byrde?
-Yes.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.182
[Javi grunts]

13:29.266 --> 13:33.187
Please tell me he has
the hillbilly bitch in line?

13:33.270 --> 13:36.357
These Byrdes are so disrespectful.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.818
Helen would have fixed this immediately.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.490
Are you joking, Javi?

13:46.784 --> 13:49.286
You nearly fucked us with your impatience.

13:52.164 --> 13:56.752
If they connect that sheriff to us,

13:58.128 --> 14:00.881
the FBI will come down here
just like they did with Lagunas.

14:00.965 --> 14:05.302
Then you will have all our blood

14:05.386 --> 14:07.888
on your soft little hands, Javi.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.601
I was careful. They'll never know.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.938
Oh, Javi was careful.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.190
[scattered chuckling]

14:18.274 --> 14:21.026
With all his years of experience.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.197
He protected us all.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.910
Or did you leave it
for somebody else to clean up? Huh?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.412
It'll be taken care of.

14:32.037 --> 14:32.955
[exhales sharply]

14:33.789 --> 14:34.665
All of it.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.969
[Omar chuckles]

14:47.052 --> 14:48.888
Now the baby is sad.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.514
[men chuckle]

14:52.099 --> 14:53.893
[sighs deeply]

15:09.783 --> 15:13.245
[Darlene] There's no problem here
except for your cowardice, Frank.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.581
When you offered me distribution,

15:15.664 --> 15:17.708
you said you had
the sheriff in your pocket.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.126
[Frank Jr] What's going on?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.211
Your daddy's a pussy.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.548
He doesn't want to make
millions dealing my dope

15:24.632 --> 15:27.301
just 'cause one measly
sheriff goes missing.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.220
[Frank] Sheriff Nix
was killed by the cartel.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.349
I'm not getting mixed up
in that shit again.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.060
They took good men from me.

15:36.143 --> 15:39.271
No protection, no distribution.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.863
[Frank clears his throat]

15:50.032 --> 15:53.994
[Zeke cooing]

15:55.287 --> 15:57.915
Hey, if I'm willing to work with her,
you should be too.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.350
[scoffs] What's this mean?

16:16.433 --> 16:17.726
"Do your fucking job"?

16:17.810 --> 16:20.062
Well, I did say, "please," see there?

16:20.854 --> 16:21.689
And?

16:22.189 --> 16:26.235
I just wanted him to…
have a look around Helen Pierce's house.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.152
Did he?

16:27.778 --> 16:30.114
[Mel] I don't know,
but, uh, it's weird, isn't it?

16:30.197 --> 16:32.116
First, she's missing, then Sheriff Nix?

16:32.199 --> 16:36.036
'Cause I gotta tell ya he seemed reluctant
to get into anything involving her,

16:36.120 --> 16:38.831
which was unusual,
it's not like I was asking for that much.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.666
[woman] Maybe he just didn't like her.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.127
There's nothing about Pierce in his files.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.215
Well, you know,
I'm-- I'm just thinking here

16:48.298 --> 16:51.552
that a lot of these beachfront properties
have a security system,

16:51.635 --> 16:54.930
so, I mean, if Sheriff Nix was there,
there could be a video.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.266
You could be sitting
on a lead and not even know it.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.064
I'll let you know if I find anything.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.069
Okay. Well, thank-- thanks so much.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.203
Sheriff Guerrero, nice to meet you.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.416
I thought I should stop by
and introduce myself. Darlene Snell.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.585
I know who you are.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.422
Oh. You from around here, Sheriff?

17:28.505 --> 17:31.216
-Polk County.
-[gasps] It's nice over there.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.927
Hey, you know the Jarvis family at all?

17:34.011 --> 17:35.888
What can I do for you, Mrs. Snell?

17:38.432 --> 17:40.476
John Nix and I go way back.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.312
He knew my husband
when they were just kids.

17:43.812 --> 17:48.400
I just wanted to stop by and see
if there was anything I could do to help.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.446
State police called off
the search a week ago.

17:52.529 --> 17:56.658
So unless you know where John is,
I don't see what you can do for me.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.454
Oh. Maybe there's something else--

18:00.537 --> 18:02.748
Mrs. Snell… sheriffs talk.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.541
We gossip.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.212
I know all about the hold
you had over John Nix.

18:08.712 --> 18:12.549
Now I'm covering two counties
while John's… "away,"

18:13.383 --> 18:15.469
and he wasn't exactly a closer.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.514
So how about you do me a favor

18:18.597 --> 18:21.350
and don't add
a bribery charge to this pile?

18:22.518 --> 18:25.729
Save it for whoever wins
the election next year.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.195
Well, all right!
Thank you for your time, Sheriff.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.697
I'll keep a good eye out for John.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.325
Be nice to have him back.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.536
[Guerrero] Wouldn't it?

18:43.956 --> 18:45.499
[sighs]

18:49.795 --> 18:51.797
[indistinct chatter]

18:53.257 --> 18:55.300
-[dealer] Seven out.
-[Sam] Dang it, again?

18:55.884 --> 18:57.344
Aw, come on, man.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.182
Hey, Wendy. How's it going?

19:04.977 --> 19:08.313
You do know…
we're not reimbursing you anymore.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.149
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah, I know.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.276
This is all my money. [chuckles lightly]

19:14.611 --> 19:15.696
Did he take a marker?

19:18.490 --> 19:21.869
No, no, it's all right. See, I got
a system almost all the way figured out.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.164
I-- I could write a book on this game,
or at least a pamphlet, right?

19:25.247 --> 19:28.792
This man is banned from the casino.
Cash him out, put his ID at the door.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.420
What are you doing?
I'm fine, you know I'm good for it.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.548
It's for your own good.
Go home, rest. You look like shit.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.267
[Wendy] So. Where do we start?

19:46.268 --> 19:47.686
[Jim] That depends.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.022
What are you after?

19:50.105 --> 19:52.733
Are-- are you trying
to insulate your family, or…

19:53.984 --> 19:55.402
do you want more?

19:57.738 --> 19:58.780
What if…

20:00.574 --> 20:03.827
I wanted all the elections
in the Midwest to run through us?

20:04.536 --> 20:05.787
National influence.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.041
Huh.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.294
Well, um…

20:12.377 --> 20:16.506
for that, you're going to need
quite the starting lineup,

20:16.590 --> 20:20.552
and not all of them are
on your side of the aisle.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.598
Are you willing to play
in someone else's sandbox for a while?

20:24.681 --> 20:25.891
If that's what it takes.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.017
All right.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.979
But there are some hard line,
fetus-loving,

20:31.063 --> 20:33.315
women-hating monsters in here,

20:33.398 --> 20:34.983
so strap in.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.028
Ideally, what you want

20:38.111 --> 20:41.490
are five key players from five states
on the Byrde Foundation board.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.743
Missouri, Michigan,
Illinois, Wisconsin, and Ohio.

20:44.826 --> 20:49.206
Now, Missouri, you've already got Wade,
but that boy don't do shit as a Senator,

20:49.289 --> 20:52.584
so you'll have to plow some cash
into making that a governorship.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.379
Michigan is your union guy.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.546
Jonathan Pittman.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.675
He is a hard-headed bitch.
You'll get along famously.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.095
Then there's Illinois,
an old friend of yours.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.599
-Don't say Schafer.
-Schafer.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.600
He retired.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.436
Yeah, but old Randall
held on to plenty of strings.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.065
He hated me in the day.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.442
Which is why
you're going to have to bring

21:17.526 --> 21:19.528
a very sunny disposition

21:19.611 --> 21:21.321
and very, very deep pockets.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.784
-How much?
-Conservative estimate?

21:25.867 --> 21:28.829
A hundred and fifty million
just to get you off your blocks.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.749
By when?

21:32.833 --> 21:34.584
You get me half by Christmas,

21:34.668 --> 21:37.546
I don't see why you can't have this done
in a couple of years.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.631
What about this year?

21:40.757 --> 21:42.759
For that you're gonna need it yesterday.

21:42.843 --> 21:46.388
There's local elections next month,
which you can't afford to miss.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.432
You get it by then,

21:48.515 --> 21:51.435
and I'd say you could buy almost anybody.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.650
Including you?

21:59.609 --> 22:02.070
I think I'm going to go
to my next appointment.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.994
[Jonah] So we'll start with the carpets,
air conditioners, decorating.

22:09.536 --> 22:12.456
The price ranges are higher,
makes it easier to hide everything.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.709
[Ruth] Good thing this place
is such a shit hole. Huh?

22:15.792 --> 22:17.544
Do you know how much you'll be making?

22:17.627 --> 22:20.505
I need a monthly estimate
to figure out how much I can wash.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.800
No, but this isn't the only place we got.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.721
Darlene's talking about building a couple
rehab centers out near the state line.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.931
We can put the rest through construction.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.768
-Yeah, that'll work.
-Hey! Boy!

22:33.935 --> 22:37.022
You want to tell me
what your parents did to John Nix?

22:37.606 --> 22:41.026
You better tell me right now
if you know one thing about it.

22:44.863 --> 22:45.906
I-- I would.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.533
I promise. I don't--
I don't know anything.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.871
No man can serve two masters, Jonah.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.873
Now you think about that.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.541
Now, get on home.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.131
He's lying.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.509
Why'd you hire him anyway?

23:06.718 --> 23:07.636
How good is he?

23:08.887 --> 23:10.430
[Ruth] Really fucking good.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.141
I think he's one of those "savornts."

23:13.850 --> 23:15.727
[engine turns over]

23:15.811 --> 23:18.313
So what's giving you
a hot flash, anyway? Hmm?

23:19.189 --> 23:21.691
KC Mob pulled out of distribution.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.778
They think the cartel hit Nix.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.656
-No shit.
-[Darlene scoffs]

23:27.739 --> 23:29.366
You've had a fucking morning.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.494
We have, because unless
you got any bright ideas,

23:32.577 --> 23:34.496
this ain't a laundering front anymore.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.874
It's just some shitty motel
you spent all your money on.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.594
[Maya] This is a terrible idea.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.142
But why would he want to meet me?

23:55.225 --> 23:56.601
What have you told him?

23:57.269 --> 24:00.981
-Just that I trust you, that's all.
-Oh, so he thinks I'm in your pocket.

24:01.064 --> 24:03.984
-Fuck you, Marty!
-No. No, no. Maya, this is a massive get.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.445
You would be the agent
that brings in Omar Navarro.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.780
-It's a massive risk too.
-No.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.992
Well-- Who else in his organization
knows about this?

24:12.075 --> 24:15.036
No one. It's-- It's you.
It's me. It's Wendy, that's it.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.913
Is someone moving against him?

24:16.997 --> 24:19.166
No, no. No one's moving against him.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.085
If anyone found out--

24:22.169 --> 24:24.629
No one suspects a thing. He's very smart.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.674
I have a family now.

24:27.757 --> 24:30.385
Mm-hmm. Well, you know,
we all have families.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.390
I don't know.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.644
I wouldn't have backup.
Can't risk telling the Bureau.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.813
-It'll leak.
-I'll be there. Wendy'll be there.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.815
Is that supposed to reassure me?

24:43.899 --> 24:44.774
Maya.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.529
I promise you that
you're going to be safe.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.531
He knows how valuable you are.

24:54.534 --> 24:57.204
We've been after him
since before I joined the Bureau.

25:05.128 --> 25:06.546
Tell me how it works.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.220
It's a-- It's a three day window.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.014
He gives you 30 minutes notice
before he sends a car.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.683
I don't know where the meeting will be,
probably in state.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.436
You want to give a cartel boss my address?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.272
That doesn't work for me, Marty.
You can't do that.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.157
Why don't you stay with us?

25:35.534 --> 25:38.537
How about you stay with us
and Charlotte will watch Wilson

25:38.620 --> 25:40.664
while we're at the meeting? He'll be safe.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.670
She dropped Jonah one time.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.172
-[chuckles]
-[Maya scoffs]

25:50.549 --> 25:51.424
Sorry.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.177
[Wilson fussing]

25:57.347 --> 26:00.225
[man] Our show has been covering
the opioid epidemic for years.

26:00.308 --> 26:03.853
We've interviewed
whistleblowers, doctors, and victims,

26:04.396 --> 26:08.525
but never has the CEO of a pharmaceutical
company agreed to sit down with us,

26:08.608 --> 26:09.526
until now.

26:10.026 --> 26:13.321
Clare Shaw takes over the role of CEO
from her brother, Michael,

26:13.405 --> 26:15.407
ousted from his family's company

26:15.490 --> 26:19.953
after he publicly blamed drug users
for creating the opioid crisis.

26:20.620 --> 26:24.165
Eight percent of our research budget
is going towards developing

26:24.249 --> 26:29.296
the next generation of opioid blockers
to help victims of addiction.

26:29.379 --> 26:32.090
We have dramatically improved
our patient programs,

26:32.173 --> 26:34.801
and every single piece of marketing
we put out now

26:34.884 --> 26:37.846
accurately reflects
the best evidence available.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.309
We've heard promises
from companies like yours before.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.852
What makes this different?

26:44.728 --> 26:46.104
This time they're true.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.695
She seems perfect. That's, uh, Missouri?

26:53.778 --> 26:57.574
Well, their head office is in Chicago,
but their factories and labs are all here.

26:57.657 --> 26:58.950
Yeah, okay. Excellent.

26:59.034 --> 27:02.287
Well, I put together this packet here
for the, uh, rehab facilities.

27:02.370 --> 27:06.082
This is, uh,
five possible sites and, uh, partners.

27:06.166 --> 27:09.294
Right here are
two early construction bids.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.380
[Jonah] Isn't Mrs. Snell building rehabs?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.507
Uh, yeah, I saw that
she was pulling permits.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.925
This is pretty reasonable.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.553
So you just stole her idea?

27:19.346 --> 27:21.848
Why do you care
what happens to Mrs. Snell?

27:21.931 --> 27:23.892
[knocking on door]

27:23.975 --> 27:24.976
Hey, it's for me.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.817
Hey. Yeah, you can just go through here.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.903
Put it all in the basement.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.535
-[Marty] What's all this?
-I'm installing a new system.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.082
Looks expensive.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.167
[Jonah] Bought it with my own money.

27:51.294 --> 27:52.754
I need it for my new job.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.466
Huh. Really?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.428
-What are you doing?
-Thanks.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.015
Washing money for Ruth.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.811
Oh, no, you are not.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.563
I'm not using your software.
I wrote my own.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.233
-[Wendy] Okay. Okay, enough.
-[van engine turns over]

28:13.316 --> 28:14.442
I know that you're angry--

28:14.526 --> 28:16.319
I'm not gonna fight
with you about this, Mom.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.904
Jonah!

28:18.571 --> 28:19.572
Jonah!

28:21.616 --> 28:23.326
-Jonah!
-Charlotte?

28:25.995 --> 28:30.166
Uh, you do not talk to Jonah
about the business anymore. Okay?

28:30.250 --> 28:31.584
Not a word, seriously.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.086
[Charlotte] Okay.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.843
-This is insane.
-I know.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.679
He's betraying our family.
We have to stop this.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.848
[Marty] I know. Um…

28:45.432 --> 28:47.684
Jesus. Laundering at 14.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.108
Do not be proud of him right now.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.703
All my old crew went into meth.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.163
Can you believe it?

29:08.246 --> 29:11.416
Doing it on the water too,
just like I taught 'em.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.502
Ungrateful shit-lickers.

29:15.628 --> 29:17.714
Don't know what's good for them, do they?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.426
I'm sorry. Wish I knew how to help.

29:23.887 --> 29:27.348
[clears throat] I did have this one idea.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.477
It's kind of, well… [chuckling]

29:30.560 --> 29:34.773
Look, I got this whole damn list
of high rollers from the casino, right?

29:34.856 --> 29:37.650
And those guys are into all kinds of shit.

29:37.734 --> 29:42.489
This one dude, this chef from Chicago,
he's connected to a whole lot of them.

29:42.572 --> 29:45.492
Does everything.
Girls, blow, even likes dope.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.620
[Darlene] One high roller is not enough.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.705
We need a whole distribution network.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.541
Well, I know. But I'm telling you,

29:54.125 --> 29:58.213
these rich fuckers will pay for anything
if you convince them it's fancy.

29:59.297 --> 30:02.759
I don't think we need to sell more.
I just think we need to charge more.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.428
[chuckling] What like…
like hipster heroin?

30:05.512 --> 30:08.181
-[grunts] I don't like that.
-[Ruth laughing] Exactly.

30:08.264 --> 30:12.185
Brand it like it's
the fucking Moët of dope.

30:12.268 --> 30:17.565
Say it's, like, cut with
natural antihistamines to prevent itching.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.234
[Wyatt and Ruth laughing]

30:19.317 --> 30:20.735
[Ruth] Multivitamins.

30:21.361 --> 30:25.031
[Wyatt] For micronutrient leaching.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.449
[Ruth snorts]

30:26.991 --> 30:28.117
[Wyatt guffaws]

30:28.910 --> 30:31.955
Honestly, with this guy talking us up,

30:32.038 --> 30:36.000
I mean, we can charge a shit ton,
and before you know it, I mean--

30:36.084 --> 30:38.545
We're in the designer heroin business.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.506
[scoffs] From farm… to needle.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.174
[Wyatt cackles]

30:43.258 --> 30:46.344
Locally sourced family heroin.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.304
-[Ruth laughing]
-[utensil clatters]

30:48.388 --> 30:51.432
[Ruth] I can head to Chicago
from the Lazy-O this afternoon.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.853
[suspenseful music building]

31:22.338 --> 31:23.172
Hi.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.425
I'm here to see Clare Shaw.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.012
Thank you.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.933
[man] Please take
the elevator to the 25th floor.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.226
Great. Thank you.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.567
[Wendy] We've already spearheaded
the biggest campaign

31:42.650 --> 31:44.652
against predatory lending in the country.

31:44.736 --> 31:48.114
And we're backing anti-corruption
initiatives across the Midwest.

31:48.197 --> 31:51.159
Voter rights in Ohio,
police corruption in Michigan.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.495
Well, there is no doubt
your work is very impressive.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.081
[Wendy] And… honestly, Clare,

31:57.999 --> 32:01.377
who else is going to put the Shaw name
on three brand new,

32:01.461 --> 32:04.881
state-of-the-art mental health
and rehab facilities?

32:04.964 --> 32:06.382
I am sure nobody.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.803
Wendy, I like the Byrde Foundation.
I like you.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.764
I do, but…

32:12.847 --> 32:16.976
risking $150 million
on a newly formed foundation

32:18.311 --> 32:20.647
just wouldn't be prudent, especially…

32:21.522 --> 32:24.442
after hearing about
the mess at your fundraiser.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.111
Your husband got knocked out?

32:30.114 --> 32:32.825
It's worse than that.
It was my brother who hit him.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.538
He has bipolar and drug issues, that--

32:38.414 --> 32:40.667
That's why building these
is so important to me.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.628
That must be awful.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.255
How is he doing?

32:49.884 --> 32:51.094
-He's missing.
-[gasps]

32:52.720 --> 32:54.055
I am so sorry.

32:55.348 --> 32:56.224
It's--

32:59.644 --> 33:00.937
Family is hard.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.021
[both chuckle]

33:05.149 --> 33:06.985
Wendy, in a couple years

33:07.068 --> 33:09.821
when we are both on sure footing,

33:09.904 --> 33:10.780
we'll do this.

33:11.447 --> 33:12.699
But for now--

33:13.282 --> 33:15.868
Shaw Medical has--
has made donations this size.

33:15.952 --> 33:19.372
[scoffs] That was before lawsuits
and nine-figure fines.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.166
I am sorry. Wendy,
it's not going to happen this time.

33:23.793 --> 33:24.794
[car horn toots]

33:26.629 --> 33:29.257
[Ruth] I'm not giving them back, Marty!
They're hid!

33:29.340 --> 33:30.633
[brakes hissing]

33:30.717 --> 33:32.719
[Marty] This is not about Ben's ashes.

33:32.802 --> 33:36.389
This is about you recruiting my son

33:36.472 --> 33:39.267
to launder money for a heroin operation.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.936
-Oh.
-Yeah, "Oh."

33:42.020 --> 33:44.689
Now, I-- I know that you're mad,
but this is low. Okay?

33:44.772 --> 33:48.067
-He's grieving. Don't use that to hurt me.
-That's not what's happening.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.570
I could have set up those accounts
if you asked me.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.571
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

33:51.654 --> 33:54.866
I'm sure Wendy would have loved that.
Darlene, too.

33:54.949 --> 33:57.994
Look, all Jonah's doing is math.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.038
He's not in an operation. He's safe.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.166
-Now get the fuck out of the way.
-Hang on. Please. "Safe"?

34:03.249 --> 34:06.377
How stupid are you?
When Darlene's involved, no one is safe.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.755
Not you, not Wyatt,
and especially not Jonah.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.132
[laughing] And you're any better?

34:11.215 --> 34:14.135
You really think you could trust someone
who shot a guy's dick off?

34:16.179 --> 34:17.847
I know what I'm doing.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.766
You don't! You're out of your depth, Ruth.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.185
And I'm not gonna let you
drag Jonah down with you, okay?

34:22.268 --> 34:24.687
-He doesn't work for you. You got it?
-[engine starts]

34:27.482 --> 34:30.485
And what exactly
are you going to do about it, Marty?

34:30.568 --> 34:32.779
Get your dick shot off too? Hmm?

34:33.571 --> 34:34.572
[sarcastic] Nice.

34:48.586 --> 34:52.131
["11/8" by Sym Fera playing]

35:13.611 --> 35:14.570
[man] All right.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.033
Holy shit.

35:19.867 --> 35:22.120
[chuckles] Looks like a fucking painting.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.164
I don't want to mess it up. [chuckles]

35:30.211 --> 35:31.170
Better?

35:31.712 --> 35:33.256
[laughing] Much.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.814
[Ruth] Mmm!

35:51.858 --> 35:53.401
This is so good.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.778
You're a better cook
than you are a poker player.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.280
[both chuckle]

35:58.489 --> 36:00.575
What are you doing in Chicago, Ruth?

36:01.200 --> 36:04.412
-You guys branching out?
-Mm-mm. No.

36:05.371 --> 36:08.207
I ain't running games no more.
I got a new venture.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.917
Something you might like, actually.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.920
Small batch of dope.
No fentanyl, no baby powder.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.964
None of that shit, guaranteed.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.134
I thought maybe
you could help me move it.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.887
[scoffs]

36:21.721 --> 36:24.182
I might like a pinch after a game,

36:24.265 --> 36:27.351
but, uh… I'm not a drug dealer, Ruth.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.812
I got a job. I own a restaurant.

36:31.105 --> 36:33.816
No, I don't need a dealer.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.111
What I need is an influencer.

36:37.195 --> 36:41.199
All I want is for you to talk it up
to the other high rollers,

36:41.282 --> 36:43.075
and the product will do the rest.

36:43.951 --> 36:45.536
I can get clean dope already.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.288
What makes yours so good?

36:47.371 --> 36:49.832
This shit hits different.

36:50.374 --> 36:53.753
Hey, you don't gotta smoke it neither.
It's pure enough to snort.

36:53.836 --> 36:58.049
You know, it's home grown,
organic, sustainable.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.761
Farm to fucking table.

37:01.844 --> 37:03.304
[both chuckling]

37:03.387 --> 37:04.639
Where are you growing it?

37:04.722 --> 37:05.723
[Ruth] Mmm.

37:06.807 --> 37:12.188
The most beautiful farm you've ever seen,
right there in the Ozarks.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.440
They make honey too.

37:14.523 --> 37:15.566
[chuckles]

37:16.108 --> 37:20.488
Seriously, Kerry.
I mean, you have got to try this.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.579
[sighs] It looks good.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.290
[Ruth] Mm-hmm.

37:47.056 --> 37:50.810
[grunts] No.
I don't-- I don't do that stuff.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.230
Well, how do you know it's so good, then?

37:55.481 --> 37:56.440
Come on.

37:57.858 --> 37:59.944
It's impolite to make me try it alone.

Okay.

38:46.657 --> 38:49.327
Yeah. I'm-- I'm, uh…
I'm interested. [sniffs]

38:49.410 --> 38:50.328
[Ruth] Hmm?

38:51.287 --> 38:53.372
I want to go to that farm, though.

38:53.456 --> 38:57.001

got to get my hands in the dirt.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.088
Yeah, no, not-- Not a problem.

39:16.395 --> 39:18.147
-Did you find anything?
-Maybe.

39:18.230 --> 39:21.942
Okay. We don't have time for maybe.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.862
I had to beg Clare for this meeting.

39:24.945 --> 39:26.989
We have a 40-minute window
to make this deal.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.033
Yeah. It's just--
It's a little crazy, you know?

39:29.116 --> 39:31.160
Well, crazy is better than nothing.

39:31.243 --> 39:32.161
[knocking on door]

39:32.244 --> 39:34.205
-[Charlotte] I got it.
-Uh, thank you.

39:34.288 --> 39:37.124
Um, Charlotte,
do me a favor, too, would you?

39:37.208 --> 39:38.709
[Charlotte] Hi! Hi, here, come in.

39:38.793 --> 39:43.547
Hey Maya! Charlotte,
please, uh… settle Maya in for me

39:43.631 --> 39:45.299
and, um, Maya, I apologize.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.552
We've got a last-minute meeting,
uh, at the casino,

39:48.636 --> 39:50.638
but I promise we're just 30 minutes away.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.264
-You'd better be.
-[Marty] Yeah.

39:55.309 --> 39:58.270
You can sleep in Jonah's room
since he's staying in Buddy's.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.610
I got the bottle warmer
that you asked for. Um…

40:04.693 --> 40:06.195
I-- I hope it's the right one.

40:06.862 --> 40:07.947
It'll be fine.

This must be weird for you.

my maternity leave panning out.

That's good soil, ma'am.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.718
Sure you don't want to taste it too?

40:29.802 --> 40:33.889
No, it's no need. I know good dirt
when I smell it. I grew up on a farm.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.307
Well, look at you.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.435
It's a beautiful spot you got here.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.311
Can I see the poppies?

40:39.395 --> 40:40.521
-Sure.
-No.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.567
[chuckles] That's all right.

40:44.650 --> 40:47.236
We had a-- a good go of it
the other night.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.822
I know you make damn fine dope, Darlene.

40:51.615 --> 40:55.870
You know, Darlene's family's been
on this land since, uh… since forever.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.455
Runs all the way to the horizon.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.956
-[Kerry] Wow, really?
-Mm-hmm.

40:59.623 --> 41:00.749
What else you grow?

41:03.377 --> 41:06.046
Uh, we grow flowers, mostly,

41:06.130 --> 41:09.008
um, but we've been thinking about
soybeans, right?

41:09.091 --> 41:11.760
Oh, for sure.
Yeah, there's a market for it.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.471
Yeah, Tatsoi is another good one.

41:13.554 --> 41:16.182
Hot new brassica.
Going the way of the Brussels sprout.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.642
[Wyatt] What about edible flowers?
They still a thing?

41:18.726 --> 41:21.145
Nah, I feel like
they're all sewn up, you know?

41:21.228 --> 41:23.481
I mean, if you got the room,

41:23.564 --> 41:25.858
you could maybe try
a small-batch dessert wine, or--

41:25.941 --> 41:28.110
Oh, shut your mouths, all of you!

41:29.069 --> 41:32.114
This ain't no bullshit, hippie co-op.

41:32.198 --> 41:35.743
And this girl isn't authorized
to make a commitment.

41:38.412 --> 41:41.123
You need to get off my land
before I put you under it.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.709
Deal's off. Wyatt.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.589
[Ruth] Darlene! Hey!

41:48.672 --> 41:51.675
Hey, I set this up for us!
This is a good idea!

41:51.759 --> 41:54.053
Darlene, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a partner in this operation.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.596
Will you just listen?

41:55.679 --> 41:59.016
-What? What the fuck?! Talk to her.
-[truck door opens]

42:00.768 --> 42:01.685
Me?

42:02.770 --> 42:04.188
It's her farm. I don't--

42:04.271 --> 42:06.690
If she doesn't wanna do it,
we gotta respect that.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.027
And… she's my girlfriend.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.904
[engine turns over]

42:12.488 --> 42:14.323
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:14.406 --> 42:16.116
[seat belt warning dinging]

42:16.200 --> 42:17.910
Those two are dating?

42:17.993 --> 42:19.078
[truck door slams]

42:19.161 --> 42:24.500
I-- I-- I can see where you--
you can't spare, um, $150 million.

42:24.583 --> 42:28.712
Uh, your opioid division is--
is about to go bankrupt, right?

42:28.796 --> 42:31.382
-You'd be lucky to make it to March.
-Hardly.

42:31.465 --> 42:33.926
We've got two new drugs
about to hit the market.

42:34.009 --> 42:36.011
We're making three
acquisitions this month.

42:37.263 --> 42:41.016
Well, I mean, you know, buying a company
and then price-hiking their,

42:41.100 --> 42:43.852
uh, their best drug
is not really a sustainable model.

42:43.936 --> 42:46.689
You know, Medicaid will be knocking
on your doors for a refund,

42:46.772 --> 42:48.566
then the short-sellers will take the rest.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.859
You know, you're in trouble.
It's right there.

42:50.943 --> 42:53.445
How'd you even get these numbers?
They're not public.

42:54.488 --> 42:56.824
Uh, no, but they're accessible.

42:57.324 --> 43:00.995
So, you know, I'm only
two months ahead of the pack, if that.

43:03.789 --> 43:05.624
This is your unmissable offer?

43:05.708 --> 43:08.961
A dressing down
by the owners of a riverboat casino?

43:09.587 --> 43:12.089
Clare, please, that--
That is not what we're doing.

43:12.172 --> 43:14.883
We just need you
to understand the reality.

43:14.967 --> 43:18.721
Your company's in trouble,
which means your family's in trouble.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.182
And we may be able to fix both,

43:23.475 --> 43:24.768
if you'll listen.

43:29.231 --> 43:30.232
[sighing] Okay.

43:32.234 --> 43:35.738
So, what-- what can you tell us
about your raw materials?

43:36.822 --> 43:39.783
If that is your angle,
you really are wasting my time.

43:40.534 --> 43:43.412
Materials is the one area
we can't cut costs.

43:43.495 --> 43:47.166
Every provider has to be licensed.
There is no meaningful competition.

43:47.249 --> 43:48.375
Just give us a moment.

43:49.001 --> 43:52.171
[Marty] We're thinking
specifically about, uh, the opium.

43:52.254 --> 43:54.840
You-- you need that for your--
your bestselling drug, right?

43:54.923 --> 43:58.302
And-- And… that's out of Tasmania, right?

43:59.178 --> 44:00.596
Afghanistan too.

44:01.180 --> 44:04.975
Tell me what you would say
if you could pay 65 percent less

44:05.059 --> 44:07.186
for that particular raw material.

44:08.979 --> 44:12.274
That would save us,
but there is only one way to do that.

44:13.609 --> 44:16.445
[ominous music playing]

44:25.329 --> 44:27.414
We can stop talking anytime you want.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.999
[Clare clears her throat]

44:32.670 --> 44:33.504
Go on.

44:35.964 --> 44:37.925
This is the exact same product,

44:38.717 --> 44:40.386
same specifications,

44:41.053 --> 44:44.473
integrated seamlessly
into your current supply,

44:45.391 --> 44:48.936
and everything is tracing back
to an FDA-approved,

44:49.019 --> 44:51.689
a DEA-cleared supplier.

44:51.772 --> 44:57.361
Clare, if we can save you
$300 million in raw materials,

44:58.362 --> 45:01.490
could you donate half of that
to our foundation?

45:01.573 --> 45:04.368
You realize we're breaking about
a dozen laws just talking about this?

45:04.451 --> 45:07.246
And as I said, we can
stop talking anytime you want.

45:11.208 --> 45:13.502
This is what your FBI audit was about.

45:13.585 --> 45:14.586
That's right.

45:15.504 --> 45:16.839
And as you'll recall,

45:17.715 --> 45:18.841
they found nothing.

45:24.263 --> 45:27.599
I believed you, when you said
that you wanted to do good.

45:29.893 --> 45:33.313
You take this deal, you--
you get $300 million

45:33.397 --> 45:35.816
of heroin right off the streets.

45:43.741 --> 45:44.783
[Wendy] We got it.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.580
[Jim chuckling] Whoa, that was fast.

45:50.330 --> 45:51.331
All in one?

45:51.874 --> 45:53.459
[Wendy] Mm-hmm. Shaw Medical.

45:54.543 --> 45:56.670
Thank you for getting those financials.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.172
[Jim] You're welcome.

45:59.506 --> 46:03.385
That's a… That's a big donation.
What'd you promise them?

46:05.637 --> 46:07.306
Their name on a bunch of rehabs.

46:08.849 --> 46:12.895
Are you sure this is a done deal?
We can't un-ring this bell.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.275
Make the offers, Jim. We're ready.

46:22.654 --> 46:24.656
[phone line disconnects]

46:26.575 --> 46:28.494
[man] You're gonna have to choose soon.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.037
Charles or the Byrdes.

46:33.332 --> 46:34.458
[Jim scoffs]

46:36.168 --> 46:37.503
[chuckling] Jeez.

46:45.302 --> 46:46.136
[Marty] Hey.

46:48.555 --> 46:50.182
Hola, Marty, cómo estás?

46:51.099 --> 46:55.103
Hi, there. What are you doing here?
I told you that, uh, it wasn't safe.

46:56.021 --> 46:57.189
I didn't go inside.

46:58.315 --> 47:00.567
Come on, hop aboard.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.281
Where we going?

47:07.741 --> 47:09.451
To clean up your mess.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.081
[phone buzzing]

47:19.628 --> 47:22.339
[suspenseful music building]

47:23.257 --> 47:24.550
[keys jingling]

47:27.719 --> 47:28.679
[Marty] Thank you.

47:52.035 --> 47:54.538
You do know that returning
to the scene of the crime

47:54.621 --> 47:56.665
is how 80 percent of idiots get caught?

47:56.748 --> 47:58.834
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

48:00.377 --> 48:01.253
How's that?

48:02.004 --> 48:03.297
You're untrustworthy, Marty.

48:04.590 --> 48:05.966
Anyone can see it.

48:08.927 --> 48:11.638
Once more with this. Walls, too.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.142
[phone buzzing]

48:17.019 --> 48:18.312
[Javi] You getting that?

48:19.354 --> 48:20.314
Yep.

48:20.397 --> 48:21.607
[sighs]

48:23.609 --> 48:25.611
[phone continues buzzing]

48:26.194 --> 48:27.279
I'm not here.

48:27.362 --> 48:29.197
You say a word and you're dead.

48:29.281 --> 48:30.991
-You, your wife--
-I get it.

48:31.074 --> 48:32.993
[Javi] Well, pick up, then.

48:34.328 --> 48:35.329
It's your boss.

48:37.539 --> 48:38.373
Hello?

48:38.457 --> 48:42.377
-[dogs barking]
-Marty, thank you for your message.

48:43.712 --> 48:46.256
Come on. Let's go. Vamos.

48:46.340 --> 48:47.507
[dogs panting]

48:47.591 --> 48:48.675
Has she arrived?

48:49.217 --> 48:50.177
[Marty] Uh, yeah.

48:50.260 --> 48:55.015
Good. And she is happy to do this, yes?

48:56.099 --> 48:57.017
Absolutely.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.019
[Omar] Something's wrong.

49:00.062 --> 49:05.609
Uh, nothing. I, um… I had something
that I need to ask you.

49:05.692 --> 49:08.695
I-- I did a-- a deal.
I should have run it by you first.

49:08.779 --> 49:09.613
With who?

49:09.696 --> 49:11.531
A pharmaceutical company.

49:11.615 --> 49:15.535
Uh… it, you know--
They need raw materials and it works well.

49:15.619 --> 49:18.664
It's-- It's more money for you.
It's less for them to spend,

49:18.747 --> 49:22.626
and, you know… It's complicated.
There's a couple extra steps, but--

49:22.709 --> 49:25.420
Is this better for my safety, Marty?

49:25.504 --> 49:28.173
For ours, which affects yours.

49:30.342 --> 49:31.551
[dogs barking]

49:31.635 --> 49:33.303
Well, then let's make it happen.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.014
Good, great.

49:37.516 --> 49:39.101
[phone line disconnects]

49:49.361 --> 49:52.823
[camera drone buzzing]

50:07.879 --> 50:09.423
[Wendy] You made a mistake!

50:11.133 --> 50:12.968
This family is getting out!

50:13.051 --> 50:16.096
The foundation just got a huge donation,

50:16.179 --> 50:17.389
life-changing.

50:17.889 --> 50:23.020
So if I were you, I'd think very carefully
about your choices right now.

50:23.979 --> 50:25.605
You're on the wrong team.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.612
What did you do with the sheriff's body?

50:33.655 --> 50:35.532
Did you burn it like the rest of them?

50:50.714 --> 50:52.924
[Marty] Okay, I think that does it.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.761
Okay, all set? Let's go.

50:58.472 --> 51:00.599
Oh my God. That's a cop.
It's a cop. Cop, cop, cop, cop.

51:00.682 --> 51:03.310
-Get rid of her.
-Yeah, just, can you hide? Come on.

51:07.022 --> 51:09.524
[suspenseful music playing]

51:09.608 --> 51:10.859
Hi, can I help you?

51:10.942 --> 51:13.320
Sheriff Guerrero.
I'm looking for Helen Pierce.

51:13.820 --> 51:17.282
Oh yeah, me too. I'm-- I'm Marty Byrde.
I'm her business partner.

51:17.365 --> 51:18.992
Oh yeah, I know you.

51:19.785 --> 51:22.079
"We like your odds." The casino guy.

51:22.162 --> 51:24.873
-The commercial, yeah. You saw that, huh?
-Mind if I come in?

51:24.956 --> 51:26.374
Oh, I'm, um…

51:27.459 --> 51:29.836
You know, I--
I have not seen her for a couple of weeks.

51:29.920 --> 51:30.962
She gave me a spare key,

51:31.046 --> 51:33.507
so I thought I'd come on in
and take a look around.

51:33.590 --> 51:34.925
You find anything?

51:35.008 --> 51:37.677
No, no. She seems to have cleared out.

51:38.678 --> 51:40.847
I know she was dealing
with a tough divorce.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.183
-So I hear.
-[Marty] Yeah.

51:47.104 --> 51:48.522
You doing some cleaning?

51:52.359 --> 51:56.029
Our, um… our business
paid her deposits, so I--

51:56.113 --> 51:58.782
You know if they have
one of those security systems here?

51:58.865 --> 52:00.826
-[Marty] No.
-A lot of these places do.

52:00.909 --> 52:03.036
[Marty] Yeah. Yeah, well, um…

52:04.621 --> 52:07.874
Uh, you know, they-- if, uh, if they do,
it probably, it's back there.

52:07.958 --> 52:11.461
Yeah, to your left, the kitchen there,
just above the, uh, microwave.

52:12.671 --> 52:15.298
-Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
-What's in that system?

52:15.382 --> 52:17.968
Get back in there.
Nothing's on the system. I wiped it.

52:19.511 --> 52:21.179
-[Guerrero] Huh.
-[Marty] What's that?

52:21.263 --> 52:24.474
-Looks like it's been off this whole time.
-Oh, yeah? Yeah, well…

52:24.558 --> 52:27.227
-[Guerrero] Yeah, that's weird.
-[Marty exhales sharply]

52:27.310 --> 52:28.603
[Marty groans quietly]

52:31.481 --> 52:32.315
You okay?

52:34.317 --> 52:35.861
Yep, yep, yep. Yep.

52:35.944 --> 52:37.028
Just, uh…

52:38.321 --> 52:40.490
Just, you know, worried.

52:42.534 --> 52:45.203
I'll check with the realtor.
She might have heard something.

52:45.287 --> 52:47.080
Okay. All right.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.583
You know you really
shouldn't have cleaned up in here.

52:49.666 --> 52:52.169
-If she's a missing person.
-Yeah. Sorry.

52:52.252 --> 52:56.298
Just-- Just assumed that
she'd gone back to Chicago, you know?

53:00.302 --> 53:01.469
Which worried you?

53:06.892 --> 53:08.977
-[Marty chuckles nervously]
-Why don't we walk out?

53:09.060 --> 53:10.270
-Okay.
-Yeah.

53:11.396 --> 53:12.898
Saw that commercial, huh?

53:12.981 --> 53:16.568
-[Guerrero] Mmm! That was something.
-Well, it could have been better, I guess.

53:17.819 --> 53:18.945
[door closes]

53:23.700 --> 53:25.702
[bugs chirring]

53:42.594 --> 53:44.137
[Wendy] You can't tell Maya.

53:45.180 --> 53:47.515
Look, I'm serious.
We need her at that meeting.

53:47.599 --> 53:49.976
She cannot know
that Navarro's nephew is here.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.269
I won't say anything.

53:54.022 --> 53:55.482
What's the new sheriff like?

53:56.608 --> 54:00.612
Uh, she's clever, I think.
Kind of hard to read.

54:00.695 --> 54:03.698
Is she smart enough to keep
her nose out of our business?

54:03.782 --> 54:06.618
Maybe. How are things here?

54:07.911 --> 54:09.704
Jonah saw us with Nix's body.

54:11.790 --> 54:14.209
[Jonah] What's the most common mistake
money launderers make?

54:14.292 --> 54:15.210
[Wendy] Jonah.

54:15.293 --> 54:16.503
[Maya] Getting caught.

54:16.586 --> 54:17.879
[scoffs] Yeah.

54:19.798 --> 54:20.799
But if you had to say?

54:20.882 --> 54:22.175
-Come on.
-I wouldn't.

54:22.259 --> 54:25.095
Let's give Agent Miller a break.
Let's let her eat. Okay?

54:25.178 --> 54:27.681
-[silverware clatters]
-[Charlotte] Fuck.

54:27.764 --> 54:29.516
[Maya] Get in the back.
Somebody's outside.

54:29.599 --> 54:31.268
Take the baby, quiet as you can.

54:41.987 --> 54:43.571
Federal agent. Hands in the air.

54:43.655 --> 54:45.573
Whoa. Hey, there.

54:46.491 --> 54:48.410
Hi, uh, I'm Mel Sattem.

54:48.493 --> 54:51.871
I'm a private investigator.
I'm down from Chicago.

54:51.955 --> 54:53.581
May I just get my ID out?

55:03.883 --> 55:05.635
What are you doing here, Mr. Sattem?

55:05.719 --> 55:07.762
I just came to chat with
the Byrdes for a minute.

55:07.846 --> 55:10.473
-The doorbell's a little hit or miss, so--
-[Marty] You okay?

55:10.557 --> 55:11.975
You know this guy?

55:12.058 --> 55:14.561
Yeah, I got this. Go ahead inside.
Wilson's crying.

55:23.820 --> 55:25.739
I have to build a fence around this place?

55:25.822 --> 55:28.450
Would you look at that.
FBI agent at your house.

55:29.784 --> 55:30.827
What's that about?

55:31.453 --> 55:32.329
Family friend.

55:32.412 --> 55:34.581
Case closed. Get the fuck off my property.

55:34.664 --> 55:35.874
Yeah. All right. Well, listen.

55:35.957 --> 55:39.294
I had this really interesting conversation
with the new sheriff this afternoon.

55:39.377 --> 55:43.298
It seems that the security footage
at Helen Pierce's house somehow got wiped.

55:44.966 --> 55:47.552
Maybe you messed it up
when you broke in there illegally?

55:47.635 --> 55:51.014
Yeah, okay. I hear that or, I don't know,
maybe you got rid of some evidence?

55:51.097 --> 55:55.310
The sheriff also mentioned you were doing
a good job in there cleaning up, too,

55:55.393 --> 55:58.271
like really scrubbing it down.
So now I got thinking,

55:58.355 --> 56:01.316
"Why doesn't this big shot CEO
just hire a cleaning company?"

56:01.399 --> 56:02.525
Good night, Mr. Sattem.

56:03.234 --> 56:05.779
You know what happened
to Helen Pierce, don't you, Marty?

56:06.529 --> 56:08.573
Yeah. Yeah, I can always tell.

56:08.656 --> 56:11.117
It's like, uh, I don't know,
a thing with me.

56:11.201 --> 56:12.494
My ex-wife hated it,

56:12.577 --> 56:16.373
but… I think she also
just kind of hated me.

56:21.378 --> 56:24.631
Is it something to do with,
uh, your wife's brother?

56:27.884 --> 56:29.511
Don't trespass here again.

56:34.432 --> 56:37.143
[Mel] Hey, thanks for the help.
It's been enlightening.

56:59.374 --> 57:01.376
[Wilson fussing]

57:03.711 --> 57:07.048
[Wilson crying]

57:19.644 --> 57:20.937
[door opens]

57:28.570 --> 57:30.572
[Wilson cooing]

57:32.949 --> 57:34.242
[Marty] You guys okay?

57:36.703 --> 57:39.456
He was just… hungry.

57:44.502 --> 57:47.005
They sleep so well for the first two weeks

57:47.088 --> 57:50.550
and then you realize
that they just hadn't woken up yet.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.763
I can't wait for my mom to get here.

57:57.390 --> 57:59.392
I didn't plan for him to be early.

58:00.685 --> 58:03.813
Yeah. It-- It's unusual for a first kid.

58:07.734 --> 58:10.945
So what's a PI doing sniffing around?

58:12.697 --> 58:14.324
What did you do now?

58:14.824 --> 58:17.118
Uh, he's looking for Helen.

58:17.202 --> 58:19.370
Her divorce went bad.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.293
Is she dead, Marty?

58:31.299 --> 58:32.926
I don't-- I don't know.

58:33.009 --> 58:36.471
I mean, she's-- She's missing.

58:37.180 --> 58:39.182
What else aren't you telling me?

58:39.724 --> 58:41.684
Something is going on.

58:41.768 --> 58:44.604
Please, if there's anything I should know…

58:47.398 --> 58:49.317
Yeah, um…

59:00.370 --> 59:03.748
Navarro's, um… nephew…

59:05.500 --> 59:06.793
was here today.

59:07.502 --> 59:09.587
That's why I didn't take your call.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.798
What's he doing here?

59:11.881 --> 59:14.592
He's just… He's checking up on us.

59:15.134 --> 59:17.387
He doesn't know anything. You're safe.

59:17.470 --> 59:20.306
He's-- He's just, you know…
He's just ambitious.

59:25.937 --> 59:26.813
Thank you.

59:28.481 --> 59:30.275
For being honest with me.

59:46.791 --> 59:48.209
[whispering] Good night.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.846
[phone ringing]

1:00:03.516 --> 1:00:04.392
Hello?

1:00:06.894 --> 1:00:07.812
Okay.

1:00:10.523 --> 1:00:11.691
Thirty minutes.

1:00:14.694 --> 1:00:17.363
[ominous music playing]

1:00:22.660 --> 1:00:23.995
[knocking]

1:00:24.078 --> 1:00:24.912
[Maya] Come in.

1:00:24.996 --> 1:00:26.247
[door opening]

1:00:28.041 --> 1:00:29.417
[Marty] We got the call.

1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:32.670
I can't do this, Marty.
It's too dangerous.

1:00:36.382 --> 1:00:38.718
[Omar] You said she was ready, Marty.

1:00:38.801 --> 1:00:40.178
[Marty] Uh, yeah, yeah, she is.

1:00:40.261 --> 1:00:42.722
She's just-- She's got a--
She's got a new baby, and it's, uh,

1:00:42.805 --> 1:00:44.557
it's not a-- It's not an easy time,

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:47.352
uh, but, um… give me a few days and--

1:00:47.435 --> 1:00:50.355
Well, or a few hours,
really, and I'll talk to her.

1:00:52.273 --> 1:00:53.399
Ten minutes.

1:00:54.108 --> 1:00:56.944
That's what you got.
Now get her in the car.

1:00:58.321 --> 1:01:00.323
Uh, we-- we're going to work this out,

1:01:00.406 --> 1:01:02.617
but it's probably gonna take
a little bit longer--

1:01:02.700 --> 1:01:04.369
[Omar] This happens today, Marty.

1:01:05.620 --> 1:01:06.954
If she's not here,

1:01:07.038 --> 1:01:09.290
you can forget about
your pharmaceutical deal.

1:01:10.667 --> 1:01:11.793
Nine minutes.

1:01:12.835 --> 1:01:14.921

1:01:15.004 --> 1:01:17.006
[phone line disconnects]

1:01:24.847 --> 1:01:27.433
-You are going to that meeting.
-[Maya] No, I'm not.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:30.061
You weren't honest with me.
How can I trust you?

1:01:30.770 --> 1:01:33.022
You do not cancel on Omar Navarro.

1:01:33.106 --> 1:01:34.107
[Maya] Not my problem.

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:36.984
I don't work for him. You do.

1:01:38.403 --> 1:01:39.570
Step aside, please.

1:01:39.654 --> 1:01:42.615
If you do not go to this meeting,
he will be very angry,

1:01:42.699 --> 1:01:44.200
and not just with us.

1:01:45.159 --> 1:01:46.661
Do you understand, Maya?

1:01:47.203 --> 1:01:50.248
If you won't protect my family,
I won't protect yours.

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:53.418
[Wilson crying]

1:02:05.722 --> 1:02:07.724

1:02:09.642 --> 1:02:13.479
[Wilson wailing]

1:02:18.943 --> 1:02:20.820
[Maya] My mom's number's in the bag.

1:02:24.073 --> 1:02:25.032
Just her.

1:02:26.075 --> 1:02:28.077
[Wilson continues crying]

1:02:29.912 --> 1:02:32.957
[ominous music playing]

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:37.962

1:03:27.845 --> 1:03:30.848
