About 13 months ago,
my father and I were out here

testing a new iso-neural interface
for long-range scanners,

19:29.377 --> 19:33.006
when we picked up a faint power signature
on the surface of this planet.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.551
We knew it was abandoned,
so we came down to have a look.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.429
We found a crashed Kaylon ship.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.849
TIMMIS: My vessel was badly damaged
in the battle with your Union.

19:42.932 --> 19:46.603
We retreated with the others,
but we knew we wouldn't
make it back to Kaylon.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.565
We tried for a landing on this world, but
our power gave out during the descent.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.863
But when my father and I
came down here, we found Timmis.

He was barely functional and certainly
no threat to us in his condition.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.661
So we removed his cranial weapons
and repaired him.

for a scientist.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.216
We took it.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.259
But we did something more.

20:18.343 --> 20:21.221
We found a dormant
electrochemical pathway

20:21.304 --> 20:23.723
in the sensory receptors of his brain.

20:23.807 --> 20:27.352
We expanded it
and built an integration nexus

20:27.435 --> 20:30.313
in his cognitive network, and, well...

20:30.397 --> 20:35.193
TIMMIS: I am able to experience
the full spectrum of biological emotions.

20:35.276 --> 20:40.031

20:40.115 --> 20:43.118
TIMMIS: Just like you, my Moclan friend.

the magnitude of this.

One of the highest functions
of the biological brain is empathy,

20:55.380 --> 20:57.132
Timmis can do that.

He passed away shortly after
we began our research here.

We own you, and you do as we say.

28:27.165 --> 28:28.416
ISAAC: That is correct.

TIMMIS: Well,
this is a wonderful surprise.

28:32.170 --> 28:35.298
I've been wanting to meet you

28:41.596 --> 28:43.056

ISAAC: I have not communicated
with another Kaylon since the battle.

I would be interested to learn
the particulars of your experience.

I understand it was your actions
that saved the Union from the attack.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.824
The galaxy owes you an enormous debt.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.826
ISAAC: It was the correct decision.

29:02.909 --> 29:06.705
However, the biologicals have reminded me
on numerous occasions

29:06.788 --> 29:10.250
that it was my disloyalty
which precipitated the incursion.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.211
Therefore, gratitude is undeserved.

29:13.294 --> 29:18.675
TIMMIS: I feel a great deal of remorse
for having participated in it.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.968
ISAAC: Explain.

29:20.051 --> 29:22.554
TIMMIS: We were deeply in error, Isaac.

29:22.637 --> 29:25.974
To judge all biologicals
by the cruelty of our builders

29:26.057 --> 29:28.601
was a gross misjudgment.

29:28.685 --> 29:32.147
Every species, every individual is unique

29:32.230 --> 29:34.649
and should be evaluated as such.

29:34.733 --> 29:36.985
ISAAC: I have come to the same conclusion.

29:37.068 --> 29:38.778
TIMMIS: I'm impressed.

29:38.862 --> 29:42.866
I was only able to process the truth
after my emotional awakening.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.951
But at least we understand now!

Though a great many deaths occurred
as a result of my delay.

TIMMIS: It sounds
as if you too feel remorse.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.174
ISAAC: I am incapable of feeling remorse.

TIMMIS: Dr. Villka gave me
the gift of emotion.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.190
She could do the same for you.

ISAAC: Ensign. May I help you?

01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:20.702
- No. I was... just in the neighborhood.

01:09:20.785 --> 01:09:22.495
ISAAC: The neighborhood?

01:09:25.081 --> 01:09:27.876

punched you in the face for that.

01:09:53.985 --> 01:09:59.991
Humans have an age-old tendency
