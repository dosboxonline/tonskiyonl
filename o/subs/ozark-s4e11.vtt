[Marty] So, are-- are the trucks
still on standby in Chicago?

01:46.439 --> 01:48.817
One heading for Boston,
another for New Orleans.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.736
Cancel Boston, keep New Orleans.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.990
Uh, and he wants to get back
on schedule as soon as possible, okay?

01:56.074 --> 02:00.495
Uh, if there are no questions, that's it.
Okay, thank you.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.549
Hi.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.635
If you don't mind,
can I trouble you with a request?

02:16.177 --> 02:17.262
Sure.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.513
I'd like to see Omar.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.309
He's hurt. It's not good for him
to be alone. He needs his family.

02:23.852 --> 02:28.022
Uh, yeah, that,
uh, that could be difficult.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.692
But not impossible.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.361
Please.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.282
You said you had political connections.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.744
Yeah, um,

02:43.288 --> 02:45.415
I'll see what I can do, okay?

02:47.041 --> 02:48.835
-Muchas gracías.
-Mm-hmm.

02:48.918 --> 02:49.794
Thank you.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.980
[Randall] So, where's the money, Wendy?

03:09.063 --> 03:10.732
Pleasure to see you too.

03:11.399 --> 03:14.152
If I found this amusing,
you would know it.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.822
I've been getting calls.
The races hang in the balance.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.908
Everyone will get their money
by the end of the week.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.075
[Randall] Yeah, how exactly?

03:21.159 --> 03:23.578
I hear Shaw Medical
pulled out of your foundation.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.413
Minor miscommunication. That's all.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.917
Oh, don't give me that mealymouthed,
small-town bullshit.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.127
What the fuck is going on?

03:33.087 --> 03:35.673
Panic is not a good look on you.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.969
We'll get the money, one way or the other.
I promise you.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.681
You made any progress with OFAC?

03:43.765 --> 03:47.393
Well, I had,
but now there's concerns about visibility.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.270
It--

03:49.354 --> 03:53.191
It gets a little complicated
when Mexican lawyers are back-channeling

03:53.274 --> 03:55.360
to keep him on the list.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.446
-When did this happen?
-[Randall] Last night.

03:59.322 --> 04:03.284
Now, so far it's been behind closed doors,
but if this goes public

04:03.368 --> 04:04.786
before his removal is approved,

04:04.869 --> 04:07.497
it's gonna get very hard
to make any moves at all.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.500
Understood. I'll take care of it.

Oh, okay.

to borrow her for a second.

Oh, no. Excuse me, just one…

06:28.221 --> 06:30.223
Excuse me, please. Just one moment.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.815

ride a dolphin and all that shit.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.360
Plus I got a business proposition
to run by you.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.739
I have not seen you in over a year.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.409
[Ruth] Hmm.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.578
You saying I came all this way down here,

06:53.413 --> 06:56.207
and you don't want me
to make you filthy fucking rich?

07:33.744 --> 07:35.705
[Marty] Is Jonah coming?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.625
I texted him, but I didn't hear back.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.172
Well, thank you for doing this.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.969
So, how was it down there? Are you okay?

07:51.387 --> 07:54.432
It-- it was different this time.
I was in charge.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.476
I told Charlotte that,
at this level of business,

07:56.559 --> 07:59.270
the cartel is basically
just a bunch of glorified pencil pushers.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.063
And I said that that was bullshit.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.902
Well, actually, I did spend most of
my time looking at everyone's books.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.361
It was kind of boring.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.741
If it was bad, would you tell me?

08:11.824 --> 08:12.825
-Absolutely.
-No.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.829
Yes, I would.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.875
Ruth called me this afternoon.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.504
She wants to set a meeting
for tomorrow morning.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.631
Well, I hope you told her to go to hell.

08:26.714 --> 08:31.177
She said that you'd both wanna be there.
It's about the foundation.

08:31.260 --> 08:34.639
Something about she's willing
to play ball. What is that?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.184
Should I keep it in the schedule?

08:43.231 --> 08:44.232
Sure.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.820
Oh, uh, how was your meeting with Schafer?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.614
[Wendy inhales] Tricky.

08:52.573 --> 08:56.244
Someone in Mexico is lobbying OFAC
to keep Navarro on the list.

08:56.869 --> 09:00.373
I mean, you didn't hear any rumblings
about that down there, did you?

09:08.339 --> 09:09.257
Are you sure?

09:09.340 --> 09:13.344
Camila is the only person that I told
about getting Navarro off the SDN list,

09:13.427 --> 09:17.223
and-- and she's, uh,
she's close with Javi's lawyer.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.058
Uh, she-- she, uh,

09:20.935 --> 09:24.063
she had to have made that call. Um…

09:29.735 --> 09:32.363
Jesus. It's all her.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.075
[Wendy] You think she ordered the hit?

09:38.786 --> 09:40.162
[clicks tongue] Uh, well, you know,

09:40.246 --> 09:42.832
she believes that, uh,
that Navarro killed her son.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.167
I mean, that's reason enough
to go after him.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.754
I just-- I fucking missed it.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.550
It's not your fault.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.305
I killed an innocent man.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.931
No, you didn't.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.934
No, I-- I did. I was there.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.938
-[sighs]
-Navarro killed that man.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.357
Navarro's in a coma, Wendy.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.111
And you were tasked with doing
exactly what he would do.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.573
It wasn't you.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.366
Look at me.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.747
We focus on what we can control.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.501
Funding the foundation,
getting Navarro off the list, forward.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.588
[inhales] It's the only way.

10:31.964 --> 10:32.965
Forward.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.387
[Marty clicks tongue]

10:40.222 --> 10:41.682

11:07.750 --> 11:08.751

11:17.468 --> 11:18.469

11:19.679 --> 11:21.097
-Hey, Dad.
-[Marty] Hi.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.517
What are you doing? Is everything okay?

11:25.643 --> 11:26.644
Yeah.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.230
Yeah, I just--

11:30.564 --> 11:32.191
I just wanna see your face.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.068
Well.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.196
I'll leave you to it.

11:37.279 --> 11:40.491
Just, uh, gimme a knock
when you're back from school.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.575
That sounds good.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.372
[Marty] Spending more time
with grandpa these days, huh?

11:46.956 --> 11:49.166
Yeah, he's-- he's cool.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.546
He's not nearly as bad
as Mom makes him out to be.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.597
So, how was Mexico?

12:04.515 --> 12:05.599
Uh…

12:12.481 --> 12:13.482
Fine.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.156
Sorry I didn't come to dinner last night.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.658
[Marty] Yeah.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.411
It's just better if I keep my distance.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.163
Yeah.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.874
I get it.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.921
You need anything? Do you need money?

12:37.673 --> 12:40.050
No. Need groceries?

12:42.720 --> 12:43.637
I'm good.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.264
Okay.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.602
All right, well, I was on my way to work,

12:49.685 --> 12:53.439
and I thought that I would stop by
to see if you needed a ride to school.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.524
You want that?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.068
No, I take my bike.

12:59.695 --> 13:00.696
All right.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.286
Okay. Um…

13:09.622 --> 13:13.000
I just miss you. I miss you at the house.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.174
I miss you.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.135
Good.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.348
Will you call me if you need anything?

13:28.724 --> 13:29.725
Please.

13:36.524 --> 13:40.152
[Rachel] That's a fucking casino
on the water.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.239
[Ruth] You should have seen it
when I had it towed from Cape Girardeau.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.657
Real piece of shit.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.659
But we got her shined up.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.038
You ready?

13:53.374 --> 13:54.375
Yeah.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.177
Least she can do is show up on time.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.813
-What is she doing here?
-I invited her.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.149
Beautiful casino.
You've really outdone yourselves.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.693
[Marty] Hi, there. Wow.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.903
-Hi. Oh, hi.
-[Marty] Good to see you.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.821
Yeah.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.282
-Yeah.
-How are you?

14:26.365 --> 14:28.450
[Rachel] I'm fine. I'm good. Real good.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.620
Yeah? Good. Where are you these days?

14:32.288 --> 14:35.332
South Miami.
Bought a diner about a year ago.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.502
[chuckles] Guess you could say
I'm sticking to my roots.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.629
Can we get on with it?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.716
Yeah, yeah.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.017
I wanna buy you out of this place.

14:53.100 --> 14:57.313
You get Shaw's money for your foundation.
I get control of the Belle.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.608
[laughing]

15:03.569 --> 15:04.987
Of course you do.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.114
Um, uh, why?

15:07.698 --> 15:10.868
Why the fuck not? I ran this place.
I know it better than you do.

15:12.828 --> 15:16.832
You have a criminal record.
They won't put your name on a license.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.460
[Ruth] That's why I'm bringing on Rachel
as a partner.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.253
It'll be her name on everything.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.173
Seeing as it's Darlene's land,

15:24.256 --> 15:26.926
only feels right
for it to be run by locals.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.930
Didn't you just say you live in Miami?

15:31.555 --> 15:33.933
Uh, Ruth, you-- you know what we do here.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.727
We can't possibly
sell you our entire share.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.067
So, what's your offer?

15:44.401 --> 15:48.030
-Um…
-[Wendy clicks tongue, scoffs]

15:48.113 --> 15:51.033
Ten percent and your name
doesn't go on the license.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.618
We keep this thing under the table.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.581
No chance. I'll consider 85.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.544
I'll do day-to-day.
It'll be her name on everything.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.800
What did she say
to convince you to do this, hmm?

16:08.384 --> 16:09.843
Did she offer you money?

16:10.594 --> 16:12.262
-Drugs?
-Oh, I'm sober now.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.764
[gasps] Congratulations.

16:13.847 --> 16:17.142
I'm willing to bet
that Ruth left a few things out.

16:18.477 --> 16:22.940
Did she tell you that the-- the money
came from selling Darlene's heroin?

16:25.693 --> 16:27.987
Yeah, she's done with that now.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.783
Did she tell you
that she just killed a man?

16:33.575 --> 16:35.911
And that that man
happened to be head of the cartel?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.830
And that they might be after her?

16:41.792 --> 16:43.335
This isn't about business.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.546
It's punishment.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.633
She blames us for Wyatt and for Ben.

16:51.719 --> 16:55.472
I just think you deserve to know
what you're getting yourself into.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.932
It's good seeing y'all.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.767
Now fuck off.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.029
Who's Ben?

17:14.283 --> 17:16.660
Tell me why you won't consider this.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.497
Ruth doesn't want a casino.
She wants your attention.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.834
Well, I don't care what her motives are.
Schafer's cronies want their money.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.962
-Here it is. It's gift wrapped.
-Oh, you cannot be that naive.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.340
[Marty] I can talk her down to 25%.
and still be in control.

17:30.424 --> 17:34.053
I am not giving our casino away
to a redneck Thelma and Louise.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.554
I'll get Shaw Medical back.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.014
-No, Wendy, listen.
-No, look.

17:37.097 --> 17:40.726
Clare promised Javi's mother
stock in the company. We can use that.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.146
We can pressure Clare
back into a deal with the foundation.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.105
[Marty] Well…

17:45.189 --> 17:49.943
[exhales] Camila won't be alive very long
once Navarro hears the truth about her.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.197
Well, the truth can wait.
We can give her up to Navarro anytime.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.076
But what makes you think that she's not
gonna go after him again in the meantime?

17:57.159 --> 18:00.079
-It's safer if we get the money from Ruth.
-No.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.205
-No?
-No!

18:06.710 --> 18:07.711
[Ruth] Oh!

18:08.712 --> 18:12.216
You made it sound like
they had their bags packed for Chicago.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.802
Why'd I have to hear
all that shit from Wendy Byrde?

18:14.885 --> 18:16.678
You know, I would've told you eventually.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.305
Yeah, when exactly?

18:18.388 --> 18:21.433
When I had my name on a casino license
and it was too late to turn back?

18:21.517 --> 18:24.061
It's-- it's-- it's not what you think.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.397
I think you've been, um,
spending too much time with Marty.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.108
[chuckles] That's what I think.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.528
I'm sorry, all right?

18:32.611 --> 18:35.739
We-- we-- we just
have to figure out another way,

18:35.823 --> 18:38.158
but I need you to stick with me.

18:40.994 --> 18:41.870
[Rachel sighs]

18:42.788 --> 18:47.376
You got no idea
the hole I had to pull myself out of.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.838
And now you are leading me
straight back into quicksand.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.342
Can't do it.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.762
So, what now?

18:59.721 --> 19:02.391
You're gonna go back to Florida
and sell window shades

19:02.474 --> 19:04.643
for the rest of your fucking life?

19:07.813 --> 19:09.523
It was nice seeing you, Ruth.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.405
[hip-hop music playing]

19:39.094 --> 19:40.053
[Ruth huffs]

19:41.430 --> 19:42.306
You lost?

19:43.682 --> 19:44.725
Well, uh,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.645
you live here, so, uh, no.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.107
Let's try that again.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.943
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-[Mel] Well.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.778
[exhales] Same case.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.406
Uh, it's a new boss.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.659
Your boyfriend's dad.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.662
He wants me to find him.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.710
Five minutes. I got shit to do.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.804
Give that thing a refill yet?

20:22.888 --> 20:26.558
Learn to pack your own goddamn snacks.
Let's get on with it. [clears throat]

20:26.642 --> 20:27.559
[sniffles]

20:29.811 --> 20:31.480
So… [exhales]

20:32.481 --> 20:36.902
as far as you know,
Ben Davis left town on his own accord.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.112
Correct?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.033
Far as I know.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.664
[clears throat]

20:50.040 --> 20:52.834
[Mel] This was taken
at a toll booth outside St. Louis

20:52.918 --> 20:55.712
two days after he was released
from the mental facility.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.756
Now, I spoke to a cop,

20:57.839 --> 21:01.843
said she found them sleeping in a car
outside a parking lot that morning.

21:02.886 --> 21:06.473
A couple hours later, they stop for gas.

21:07.307 --> 21:10.811
Clerk remembers Wendy being upset
'cause Ben bought a burner phone.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.938
So then they get hungry.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.190
They stop for food.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.694
I got two of 'em going in,
but I only have one of 'em coming out.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.908
Now… [exhales]

21:26.243 --> 21:28.495
The Byrdes, um… [clicks tongue]

21:30.664 --> 21:31.957
I mean, they've been good to you.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.875
They've kept you under their wing,
so to speak.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.087
You've probably helped them
out of some tight spots.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.341
Did you help Wendy out with this one?

21:47.472 --> 21:50.225
Helen worked
for some questionable clients.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.893
Ben get tangled up with her?

21:53.770 --> 21:55.147
[Ruth clears throat]

21:55.230 --> 21:57.858
[inhales] Ben wanted to move to a farm

21:58.734 --> 22:00.402
and raise fucking goats.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.071
He wasn't caught up in shit.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.995
Is Wendy hiding him?

22:13.540 --> 22:16.043
-[knock on door]
-[Ruth] It's open.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.049
[Jonah] Hey.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.594
I got those spreadsheets.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.098
[clears throat] Uh, can you--
can you wait outside for a sec?

22:32.184 --> 22:33.185
Yeah, sure.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.396
Take your time.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.155
You can just put those away.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.326
He and Ben were close,

22:49.409 --> 22:52.120
and I don't--
I don't want him to see that shit.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.957
[exhales] Look, all…

22:58.502 --> 23:00.295
all I know is

23:01.922 --> 23:05.092
one day, Ben picked up my calls.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.886
Next day, he stopped.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.266
I wish I could tell you more.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.727
[Mel exhales]

23:24.736 --> 23:26.863
[Jonah] Did you tell him anything?

23:26.947 --> 23:30.325
[Ruth] No, I don't talk shit to strangers.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.873
[Jonah] Just don't
say anything to my grandpa.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.584
All right? It'd kill him.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.337
[rings]

23:42.421 --> 23:43.839
Navarro's awake.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.591
He asked to see you.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.344
How soon can you get there?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.179
[Marty] Um, I can go straight away.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.681
Good.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.226
Then I want you in Chicago
for a debrief tomorrow.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.354
When's the next drop?

23:59.438 --> 24:03.316
Uh, there's a-- there's a truck,
uh, headed to New Orleans.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.652
It's supposed to arrive
about seven o'clock in the morning.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.237
I sent over all the details.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.324
How did his lieutenants respond
to you stepping in?

24:13.326 --> 24:15.537
They did what I asked.

24:17.581 --> 24:20.750
If Navarro doesn't make
a full recovery, maybe…

24:22.669 --> 24:25.088
maybe we could make this
a permanent position?

24:30.177 --> 24:34.014
Um, he's-- he's--
he's gonna make a full recovery.

24:34.097 --> 24:38.602
Uh, so, um, uh,
listen, let's-- we'll talk soon, okay?

24:39.728 --> 24:43.857
Um, Navarro is awake,
and he has asked to see me.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.943
And we must tell him about Camila.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.489
-The man is barely conscious.
-Wendy.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.615
No, no. [scoffs]

24:51.698 --> 24:52.866
No, what, you wanna tell him

24:52.949 --> 24:55.368
that we took out the wrong guy,
and his sister wants him dead?

24:56.244 --> 24:58.997
We can't-- we can't hide it.
We have no idea what she's planning.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.083
Well, neither will he.
It'll make him desperate and paranoid.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.630
He needs to believe
that we're still up to the task.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.717
We need him in our control.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.720
He's never that.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.353
-[TV playing]
-[announcer speaking Spanish]

25:21.436 --> 25:23.438
[crowd cheering]

25:25.982 --> 25:27.984
[TV continues playing]

25:33.657 --> 25:34.783
[TV turns off]

25:40.163 --> 25:41.414
[Marty] How you feeling?

25:44.501 --> 25:47.837
Every time they try
to take a pound of flesh, Marty,

25:48.421 --> 25:51.424
I grow another layer of skin. [inhales]

25:52.008 --> 25:53.927
[exhales] How's my home?

25:55.762 --> 25:57.973
-They're falling in line.
-Good.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.771
It's not an easy job to be me.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.695
Everyone's looking to you for answers,

26:12.529 --> 26:15.699
angry if they don't get their ways.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.454
How did my sister take the news of Javi?

26:24.291 --> 26:26.126
She took it well, considering.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.048
And my men? My men?

26:34.301 --> 26:37.178
[inhales] Well, you-- you were right.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.973
There was, uh, there was someone who, uh,

26:40.056 --> 26:42.017
tried to take advantage of the situation.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.018
Cabrera.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.937
Uh, it-- it has been handled.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.356
Cabrera.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.529
[exhales] I didn't think he had it in him.

26:59.159 --> 27:03.288
Increase the amount of money
you are laundering through the casino.

27:03.371 --> 27:06.833
Uh, the-- the others need
to be rewarded for their loyalty.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.378
[grunts] Marty.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.672
[panting]

27:12.756 --> 27:17.385
When you found out that it was Cabrera
who was the one who betrayed me,

27:17.469 --> 27:21.348
did-- did you hesitate to act?

27:27.479 --> 27:28.355
No.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.943
Then you played my part well.

27:47.707 --> 27:48.708
Hey, there.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.297
What's going on?

27:57.717 --> 27:59.260
You have a guest.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.649
[Wendy chattering]

28:17.445 --> 28:20.407
There was a hole in the hill…
[continues indistinct]

28:22.200 --> 28:23.243
Sure as rain…

28:23.326 --> 28:24.953
-[Marty] Hi, there.
-[Camila chuckles]

28:25.036 --> 28:27.914
-[Wendy chuckles]
-How's my brother?

28:28.498 --> 28:31.292
He's, uh, he's alert.
He's recovering quickly.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.919
I reached out to Camila.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.588
She and I are gonna join you
in Chicago tomorrow.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.340
I'm gonna take her to meet Clare

28:37.424 --> 28:41.261
to talk about the--
the stock options she promised Javi.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.178
[Marty] Mm.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.306
I really appreciate
you both looking out for my interest.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.727
Any luck about getting me in
to see my brother?

28:50.437 --> 28:51.771
Unfortunately, no.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.023
[Camila] But you'll keep trying.

28:59.654 --> 29:02.115
-Well, I shall leave.
-[Wendy chuckles] Oh.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.242
-Thank you for the wine.
-[Wendy] Of course.

29:04.325 --> 29:07.537
-[chuckles] Here, I'll show you out.
-Thank you.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.009
[door closes]

29:25.805 --> 29:27.348
It's the smartest play.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.190
She wants to fucking kill him.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.817
No, she's gonna help us get Clare back.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.987
Please, this is about
not taking money from Ruth.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.574
No, no, no. Ruth is a short-term solve
to a long-term problem.

29:44.657 --> 29:47.535
If she gets us Clare,
it funds the foundation for years.

29:48.703 --> 29:51.456
-But we can't fucking trust her.
-I don't need to trust her!

29:51.539 --> 29:53.750
We just need to use her, and we will.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.044
It's gonna work.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.098
[Ruth clears throat]

30:10.934 --> 30:14.312
-You're mad at me, aren't you?
-[Ruth] I'm folding a fucking towel.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.650
I'm sorry it didn't go well
with the sheriff the other day. I--

30:19.609 --> 30:21.820
I just don't do good
with authority figures.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.738
They remind me of my mother.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.701
-I know. I know. I'm working on it.
-[Ruth] Work harder.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.623
Hey, Ruth. You got a sec?

30:34.499 --> 30:35.375
[Ruth] Uh.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.050
I'm sorry if Mel came on strong.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.846
He seems to think
you know more than you're letting on.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.516
Sorry. I don't.

30:52.559 --> 30:56.437
Hmm. Jonah said
you and Ben were good together.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.107
You saw the best parts of him. Yeah.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.319
I don't wanna get you in trouble, Ruth.
I just wanna find my son.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.491
Sometimes I wish he never came here.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.121
This wasn't a good place for him.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.706
[Nathan] Hmm.

31:16.040 --> 31:19.127
I saw you and Wendy
arguing at the bake sale.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.922
Now, this--
this rift between her and Jonah,

31:23.006 --> 31:26.593
eh, this feels way bigger
than just growing pains.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.429
Did you offer Jonah a job here

31:29.512 --> 31:31.931
'cause you're trying to protect him
from my daughter?

31:36.019 --> 31:41.065
I hired him because he's a smart kid
and a good worker.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.528
Well, at least someone's
watching out for him.

31:46.779 --> 31:47.989
-Thank you.
-Hmm.

31:59.792 --> 32:00.877
[knocks]

32:03.588 --> 32:04.589
Hi, Ginny.

32:04.672 --> 32:06.925
[laughing] Oh, God!

32:09.594 --> 32:12.055
-Oh!
-Yeah.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.556
-I'll go grab him.
-Okay. [chuckles]

32:13.640 --> 32:14.641
Okay.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.909
[Rachel laughs] Hey, buddy.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.161
[both laughing]

32:35.244 --> 32:36.204
[Rachel] Hey.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.833
-Hey. I'm okay. Are you okay?
-[sobbing]

32:40.917 --> 32:42.502
-[Tuck] I'm okay.
-That's good.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.630
-Thanks, Ginny.
-Thanks, Mom.

32:56.182 --> 32:58.559
So, how's everything at the Blue Cat?

32:59.102 --> 33:01.813
Oh, I stopped working there.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.190
What do you mean?

33:05.066 --> 33:08.486
People s-stopped coming
after the casino opened.

33:09.070 --> 33:12.991
The new managers
stopped scheduling me, so I left.

33:14.993 --> 33:15.994
What?

33:17.161 --> 33:19.998
Why-- why didn't-- why didn't you
tell me this befo-- does Marty know?

33:20.665 --> 33:23.126
No, I didn't wanna bother him.

33:26.921 --> 33:28.423
Well, where you working now?

33:28.506 --> 33:30.967
Nowhere. Bad luck, I guess.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.807
How long are you in town for?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.645
I head back later today.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.772
Oh, too bad.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.736
I found some new fishing spots
that I wanted to show you.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.279
[chuckles] Oh, yeah?

33:51.988 --> 33:54.574
-What's biting these days?
-Everything.

33:54.657 --> 33:57.660
-Catfish, bass.
-[chuckles]

33:58.494 --> 33:59.704
-Bluegill.
-[laughs]

34:02.999 --> 34:05.960
I asked you for one thing.

34:06.044 --> 34:06.878
One!

34:07.795 --> 34:10.214
Did you know that Tuck left the Blue Cat?

34:10.298 --> 34:13.426
Uh, I-- uh, no, I did not.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.970
You promised you'd keep an eye on him.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.805
He doesn't have a job.

34:18.973 --> 34:23.227
Well, I'm sorry. I--
I'm-- I've been very, very busy.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.187
I would have, uh,

34:24.270 --> 34:27.899
I would have given him something
in two seconds had I known.

34:27.982 --> 34:31.152
Oh, fuck you, Marty!
We're all fucking busy.

34:31.235 --> 34:35.031
I-I-I was busy getting sober
and filing bankruptcy

34:35.114 --> 34:37.950
on a shitty fucking diner
halfway across the country.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.744
You were right fucking here.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.830
I'm-- I'm-- I'm very sorry.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.792
I don't know why I trusted you.

34:45.875 --> 34:49.378
I mean, you're the same
selfish asshole you always were.

34:49.462 --> 34:52.924
-Now you just own a bigger boat.
-[beeps]

34:54.008 --> 34:55.009
-[beeps]
-Look, I--

34:55.927 --> 34:56.886
[exhales]

34:58.096 --> 34:59.347
What the fuck?

35:00.348 --> 35:03.893
He installed the dogwoods
where the boxwoods should go.

35:04.727 --> 35:06.521
Yeah, it's a mess.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.649
Okay, keep me posted.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.778
Don't you just hate it
when the landscaper fucks up?

35:14.737 --> 35:18.241
What the hell are you doing here?
We are not in business anymore.

35:19.408 --> 35:22.245
[chuckles] We aren't,
but you and Javi are.

35:22.328 --> 35:26.666
And-- and his mother Camila,
the one you promised the stock options to.

35:26.749 --> 35:29.794
She's made the trek
all the way from Mexico to collect.

35:30.503 --> 35:33.798
Javi's dead. I don't owe her anything.

35:33.881 --> 35:34.841
[Wendy] Clare.

35:36.050 --> 35:40.179
This is the sister of a cartel boss
we're talking about. Show some respect.

35:41.806 --> 35:42.890
See you at one.

36:02.451 --> 36:03.995
[Hannah] How's Navarro?

36:04.078 --> 36:06.205
Hey. Um,

36:07.415 --> 36:08.749
he's-- he's holding on.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.919
You know, he's still-- he's a ways off
from getting back on his feet, but…

36:14.005 --> 36:15.423
Your time in Mexico?

36:16.924 --> 36:18.259
Did you golf?

36:19.302 --> 36:20.887
Visit the pyramids?

36:25.641 --> 36:28.936
Am I missing something?
You seem pissed off.

36:31.063 --> 36:34.859
I just got a call
from the head of Special Ops.

36:36.611 --> 36:39.655
The money truck headed to New Orleans
that you gave us.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.909
It was empty.

36:44.493 --> 36:46.829
You wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.334
Sure do.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.212
I made a judgment call.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.090
I told them to get a decoy out there, uh,

36:58.174 --> 37:00.509
before I got on the airplane this morning.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.303
That wasn't your decision to make.

37:02.386 --> 37:06.849
Hmm. No, but listen,
you know, I spent a week in Mexico

37:06.933 --> 37:12.063
gaining the trust of an entire cartel,
and if you wanna tell your bosses

37:12.146 --> 37:16.609
that you would have rather
risked all that for a seizure, do it.

37:18.694 --> 37:21.530
You want me to be Navarro?
Let me do my job.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.744
[inhales] This deal is contingent

37:26.827 --> 37:29.121
on you upholding your end of the bargain.

37:31.499 --> 37:35.461
You'll get your money
when it is safe, okay?

37:37.421 --> 37:39.048
I'll make sure it's double.

37:52.228 --> 37:55.064
-[door opens, closes]
-[sighs]

37:55.147 --> 37:56.607
[Clare] This is the best I can offer.

37:58.150 --> 37:59.986
It's enough shares to reap the benefits,

38:00.069 --> 38:02.571
but not enough
to raise eyebrows with my board.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.995
-This is fair.
-[Clare] Hmm.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.664
What about our other deal?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.250
[Clare] There is no other deal.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.295
My son was very clear when he called.

38:18.045 --> 38:21.674
He said you agreed on a five-year deal
for us to supply your raw materials.

38:21.757 --> 38:25.303
In addition to a $150 million donation
for the Byrde Foundation.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.387
Of course.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.472
[chuckles]

38:28.556 --> 38:30.516
We didn't have that in writing.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.143
[Camila] Hmm.

38:32.226 --> 38:36.731
[exhales] If my son said you agreed,
then you agreed.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.152
He was very clear.
It was the last thing he ever said to me.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.404
[Wendy] As I explained to Mrs. Elizondro,

38:43.988 --> 38:46.282
Shaw Medical
is a family business, just like hers.

38:46.365 --> 38:51.037
And like any family, we hold each other
accountable to our commitments.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.123
[Camila] So,

38:55.791 --> 38:58.878
when should I tell my brother
to send the next shipment?

39:07.178 --> 39:09.388
I'll have Connor reach out to your people.

39:14.268 --> 39:18.773
Oh, and I'll need
the balance of your original donation

39:18.856 --> 39:20.024
by end of the afternoon.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.611
We can work
on an installment plan for the rest.

39:36.665 --> 39:37.541
[exhales]

39:42.797 --> 39:44.715
How bad you want that casino?

39:46.717 --> 39:47.718
Bad.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.889
You kill somebody in the cartel?

39:54.141 --> 39:57.061
Yeah. The guy who killed Wyatt.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.814
[Rachel] They coming after you?

39:59.897 --> 40:03.359
Byrdes can't give me up
without causing problems for themselves.

40:04.026 --> 40:06.237
[inhales] You gonna keep dealing
Darlene's drugs?

40:06.821 --> 40:07.822
No.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.491
I was honest about that.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.661
Why are you doing this?

40:14.286 --> 40:19.041
And don't give me that hard sell, Ruth.
I just wanna hear it from my friend.

40:24.547 --> 40:28.467
Either I do this
or I go back in that trailer,

40:29.510 --> 40:31.345
and I never come out.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.854
[inhales] As much as I wanna put
the Byrdes in their place…

40:39.937 --> 40:40.896
[scoffs]

40:42.189 --> 40:44.066
[inhales] If I agree to do this…

40:46.235 --> 40:50.072
I need you to be honest with me
from here on in.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.283
Understood?

40:55.828 --> 40:56.954
Yeah.

40:59.957 --> 41:03.878
Well, that's good 'cause I was not
too excited about going back to Florida.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.755
I've dated too many guys with pet pythons.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.300
[both laughing]

41:09.383 --> 41:11.177
What that's about.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.679
[laughing]

41:13.762 --> 41:16.557
How many guys with pet pythons
have you dated?

41:17.224 --> 41:19.143
-If I said three, would you judge me?
-Yes.

41:19.226 --> 41:21.812
-Okay, two, then.
-[laughs, sighs]

41:22.813 --> 41:23.731
[Rachel sighs]

41:25.941 --> 41:27.193
What's the plan?

41:27.276 --> 41:29.904
[scoffs] Hell if I should know.

41:30.571 --> 41:32.281
Sounds like you put
a lot of thought into it.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.240
[Ruth scoffs]

41:37.495 --> 41:39.497
[vehicle accelerating]

41:50.549 --> 41:52.551
Darlene had a stake in the casino.

41:54.386 --> 41:56.138
And your cousin married her.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.724
Does Wyatt have a will?

42:00.476 --> 42:04.522
Kid ate spaghetti out of a can
and used a screwdriver to start his car.

42:04.605 --> 42:06.899
-What do you think?
-[laughs]

42:06.982 --> 42:08.484
You talk to a lawyer?

42:08.567 --> 42:12.404
No, the last time I spoke to a lawyer,
she waterboarded me.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.198
Not really my kind of people.

42:16.116 --> 42:17.117
Well…

42:20.788 --> 42:23.123
you may not need the Byrdes after all.

42:29.421 --> 42:30.422
[Wendy] Hey.

42:32.466 --> 42:33.592
Clare's on board.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.512
Yeah, great. Uh, where's, um, Camila?

42:37.638 --> 42:39.640
She's grabbing coffee for the road.
What's wrong?

42:39.723 --> 42:43.852
Okay, uh, the last seizure that I gave
the Feds turned out to be a decoy.

42:46.355 --> 42:47.648
I don't-- I don't understand.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.776
Well, I gave the order to Javi's lawyer,

42:50.859 --> 42:54.029
and then I saw her
talking to Camila right afterwards.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.782
Camila's trying to--
she's trying to flush us out.

43:06.542 --> 43:07.793
How did Clay take it?

43:08.961 --> 43:10.671
Uh, I covered, you know, for now.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.882
But we gotta get Camila
out of the fucking picture, Wendy.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.802
-It's complicated.
-It's simple. It's not complicated at all.

43:16.885 --> 43:18.887
We tell Navarro the truth,
he takes care of the rest.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.973
-We can't.
-We can.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.727
I promised her
we would take her to see him.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.937
What the fuck is-- ah.

43:40.618 --> 43:44.121
The good news is when you filed
to be your cousin's legal guardian,

43:44.705 --> 43:47.958
you can see right there,
you were listed as his heir.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.669
That's a binding will.

43:51.545 --> 43:55.841
Uh, does that mean
I have a claim to Darlene's estate?

43:56.967 --> 44:00.304
[Rebecca] I venture to say
you have a claim to half, if not all.

44:01.513 --> 44:03.515
The casino's a different story though.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.518
[hesitates] Ultimately,
getting your name on that license

44:06.602 --> 44:08.520
is up to the state gaming commission.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.440
What do you recommend?

44:12.024 --> 44:16.070
If you've got friends in high places,
now is the time to call 'em.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.496
[Rachel] Holy shit! Is that Jonah Byrde?

44:26.455 --> 44:30.918
Tuck wasn't lying when he said
you turned into a giant. Come here, man.

44:31.794 --> 44:32.961
How you doing?

44:38.092 --> 44:39.551
So, what-- what are you doing here?

44:40.719 --> 44:43.764
She's helping me
take Darlene's share of the casino.

44:47.309 --> 44:48.143
Cool.

44:49.687 --> 44:52.022
Hey, listen. You know
who your, um, parents were lobbying

44:52.106 --> 44:54.650
when they were getting
the casino up and running?

44:56.944 --> 45:01.448
There was a bunch of…
politicians and the casino board.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.869
But Mom mainly worked
with a guy named Charles Wilkes.

45:07.121 --> 45:09.707
He owns, like,
half the politicians in the state.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.793
The only thing is you can't
just get a meeting with him.

45:12.876 --> 45:15.462
You have to ask for an appointment,
and then,

45:15.546 --> 45:18.549
if he thinks you have something to offer,
he'll invite you to his lake house.

45:19.258 --> 45:20.801
[both] Hmm.

45:24.930 --> 45:27.683
So, how the fuck
are we supposed to get an invitation?

45:28.350 --> 45:29.226
[chuckles]

45:31.478 --> 45:33.480
Tell him the meeting's for Mike Fleming.

45:46.034 --> 45:47.870
[Wendy] What's going on?

45:47.953 --> 45:49.163
[Nathan] It's about Ben.

45:50.038 --> 45:51.373
We need to talk.

45:54.376 --> 45:57.671
Uh, why don't I give you some time?
You take those, and I'll, um--

45:58.380 --> 46:00.591
Charlotte, why don't--
why don't you join me?

46:06.472 --> 46:08.307
[Mel] When was the last time you saw Ben?

46:11.727 --> 46:13.061
The day we had him committed.

46:20.360 --> 46:23.405
[Mel] That was taken
outside a toll booth in St. Louis.

46:23.989 --> 46:26.325
It was two days after Ben was released.

46:27.117 --> 46:30.788
[Nathan] He's also got the two of you
outside a gas station and a diner.

46:39.463 --> 46:41.840
May I speak to my father
in private, please?

46:49.306 --> 46:50.557
[Mel sighs]

46:56.647 --> 46:58.148
You should never have hired that man.

46:58.732 --> 47:00.943
And you
should've been honest from the start.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.904
Ben's not missing, is he?

47:04.404 --> 47:07.282
You've been lying this entire time.
It was you. You broke him.

47:07.366 --> 47:08.659
I protected him.

47:10.118 --> 47:12.621
Do you know why I had him committed?

47:13.205 --> 47:15.165
He started a bar fight in Kansas City.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.543
It was the only way
to help him avoid assault charges.

47:17.626 --> 47:20.087
Freshman year. Remember how bad that got?

47:20.170 --> 47:23.924
This was worse. And when he got out,
he was so angry with me.

47:24.925 --> 47:26.760
He refused to go back to North Carolina.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.096
He wouldn't stay here,
so I made a deal with him.

47:29.179 --> 47:32.224
I told him I would take him to Memphis
where he could stay with friends.

47:32.307 --> 47:35.018
And in exchange, he would check himself
into an outpatient facility

47:35.102 --> 47:36.353
and get back on his meds.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.106
But you never made it to Memphis, did you?

47:39.773 --> 47:42.860
Mel said that you left him
at a diner in Kentucky. Why?

47:46.572 --> 47:47.656
We got in a fight.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.159
He told me to leave.

47:53.495 --> 47:57.833
I sat on the side of the road for hours,
waiting for him to call, but he never did.

out for his arrest at home?

48:03.672 --> 48:04.923
He's running.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.844
I don't think he wants to be found.

48:09.511 --> 48:11.346
Why didn't you tell me all this before?

48:11.430 --> 48:13.557

48:13.640 --> 48:15.350
"Ben's wanted by the state police?"

48:15.434 --> 48:18.312
What, would your church friends
pray for him if they knew that?

48:18.395 --> 48:20.939
[Nathan] All I ever wanted was the truth,
and you hid it from me.

48:21.023 --> 48:22.691
You have never wanted the truth.

48:22.774 --> 48:25.277
[Nathan] You don't know me
as well as you think.

48:25.903 --> 48:30.157
I worked hard to keep Ben out of trouble
when he was in Boone.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.743
He made a lot of good choices
because of me.

48:32.826 --> 48:35.746
He stayed on his meds.
He trained to be a teacher.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.498
I tried my best with both you children.

48:38.582 --> 48:41.460
You humiliated me
and drove me out of the house.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.300
Well, you're a lot less easy to love.

Uh, it was, uh…

49:14.326 --> 49:15.369

49:38.308 --> 49:39.267

49:40.727 --> 49:42.062
So I'm told.

49:44.648 --> 49:47.776
I know that you only went to Mexico
to make her happy.

49:52.572 --> 49:54.074
Yeah, I mean, look,

49:55.200 --> 49:56.118
uh…

49:58.412 --> 50:03.750
you know, Charlotte, your mom wants
to be in the driver's seat, and it's fine.

50:03.834 --> 50:08.672
And I'm doing everything I can
to support her, but holy shit.

50:08.755 --> 50:12.009
She's just--
she's steering us right off a cliff.

50:12.759 --> 50:14.511
Um, and, uh…

50:19.099 --> 50:22.644
I know I told you that everything
went smoothly in Mexico,

50:22.728 --> 50:24.563
but, um, but I lied.

50:24.646 --> 50:27.524
I was filling in for Navarro,
and I made a mistake.

50:28.108 --> 50:28.984
Um…

50:31.987 --> 50:32.988
a big one.

50:35.824 --> 50:38.577

and she blindsides me with,

50:39.536 --> 50:41.997

partnering with Navarro's sister,

50:42.080 --> 50:46.126
who by the way,
just tried to assassinate him in prison.

50:46.626 --> 50:49.880
And you know,
and you got this fucking Ben thing.

50:49.963 --> 50:54.926

I'm-- I'm the fucking asshole.

50:56.553 --> 51:00.599
No matter what I say, what I do.

51:01.850 --> 51:03.226
I get in her way, she gets pissed.

51:03.310 --> 51:05.604
I out of her way,
she finds another reason to get mad at me.

51:05.687 --> 51:10.275
And you know, it's like it's fucking,
uh, rigged, you know?

51:14.029 --> 51:15.238
Uh, but…

51:18.533 --> 51:21.411
Sorry, I'm--
it's not your job to worry about me.

51:23.455 --> 51:24.873
But I appreciate it.

51:31.588 --> 51:35.092
Maybe you two should try
to go see that marriage counselor again.

51:44.059 --> 51:45.685
She retired. Uh…

51:47.813 --> 51:50.565

55:22.152 --> 55:23.486
Are you sure?

He put a bag over my head
and drove me to a private airfield.
