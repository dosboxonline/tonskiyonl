01:14:26.466 --> 01:14:28.385
ISAAC: I wish to speak.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:46.194
Dr. Finn assisted me
with the construct of my statement.

01:14:46.277 --> 01:14:50.281
However, the substance is my own.

01:14:50.365 --> 01:14:52.742
I presume it will be adequate.

01:14:54.786 --> 01:14:58.123
Ensign Burke loved pancakes.

01:14:58.832 --> 01:15:02.043
She consumed them with butter
but no syrup

01:15:02.127 --> 01:15:07.048
and was indifferent to the addition
of berries or other condiments.

01:15:09.134 --> 01:15:13.304
As a child, pancakes
were her favorite breakfast.

01:15:15.807 --> 01:15:20.812
I served with Ensign Burke
for 257 days,

01:15:20.895 --> 01:15:25.025
17 minutes and 49 seconds.

01:15:25.775 --> 01:15:31.740
And yet, my understanding
of her remained incomplete.

01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:35.744
She had an impressive brain
for a biological.

01:15:36.786 --> 01:15:40.957
She perceived the universe
in ways others could not.

01:15:42.667 --> 01:15:46.046
Ensign Burke
regarded me as an enemy.

01:15:47.756 --> 01:15:50.216
Yet despite her animosity,

01:15:50.884 --> 01:15:55.889
she chose to save my life
when no one else was able.

01:15:57.515 --> 01:16:00.435
And in the final seconds of her own life,

01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:06.608
Ensign Burke substantiated
for all the galaxy her true nature.

01:16:07.359 --> 01:16:11.780
One of integrity and selflessness.

01:16:13.573 --> 01:16:15.784
And in her sacrifice,

01:16:16.701 --> 01:16:22.082
she inspired the enemies of the Union
to become friends.

01:16:25.377 --> 01:16:27.629
Her existence was brief.

01:16:29.089 --> 01:16:33.802
But, much like the first domino
in a succession,

01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:39.140
her impact will be felt
far into the future.
