01:32.383 --> 01:35.970
[exhales] I was thinking,
we should get some, like, big-ass speakers

01:36.054 --> 01:38.264
for outside on the porch there, like,

01:38.973 --> 01:41.059

01:41.142 --> 01:42.435
Hmm, and a guesthouse,

01:42.519 --> 01:45.772

we don't wanna deal with,

01:45.855 --> 01:47.065

01:48.149 --> 01:53.446
And that driveway there,
you know, the circular kind,

01:53.530 --> 01:55.990
where you never even have to back up.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.076

-Says who?

02:06.543 --> 02:08.628
It's a big house.
If you got a big house… [exhales]

02:08.711 --> 02:10.880
…you gotta have a pool, right?

02:10.964 --> 02:14.717

when we have a lake?

02:14.801 --> 02:18.596

02:18.680 --> 02:21.474

03:08.605 --> 03:11.691

04:07.538 --> 04:10.625
I need you to clean something up for me,
then get to Chicago.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.255
Okay, can you-- can you tell me
what you're talking about, Javi?

04:16.214 --> 04:18.549
I set a meeting
for tomorrow morning at Shaw.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.969
I want to renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.932
Okay, um, and-- and the cleanup?
Tell me-- tell me about that.

04:26.015 --> 04:29.269
-What-- what do I have to clean up?
-Um… [chuckles]

04:30.520 --> 04:32.855
I finally took care
of that hillbilly cunt.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.193
[Marty] Wow. Really?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.780
Um, why-- why the fuck did you do that?

04:40.863 --> 04:43.783
My uncle should have done it
when she killed Del.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.618
It's done now.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.496
Clean it the fuck up,
and I'll see you in Chicago.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.707
-You got it.
-[line beeps]

04:53.334 --> 04:56.587
He expects us to clean up the scene
and then, uh, and then get to Chicago.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.881
We gotta meet with Clare
at Shaw in the morning.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.384
You didn't tell him about Ruth?

05:02.927 --> 05:05.388
[Marty] Mm-hmm. Why would I do that?

05:05.471 --> 05:07.098
She wants to kill him.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.226
Okay, if I--
if I tell him, then, you know,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.811
I put her in danger for no good reason.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.105
How about keeping him alive
to keep our family safe?

05:14.188 --> 05:15.815
I'd say that's a pretty good reason.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.067
Wendy, you know him.
He'd kill her just for thinking it.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.152
It's not our business.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.153
[Marty scoffs]

05:20.236 --> 05:23.114
-[Jonah] Of course it's our business.
-Look, this is not personal.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.032
It's Ruth.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.160
Look, can you just--
just let your father and I talk this out?

05:27.243 --> 05:30.455
[Jonah] No, no. Hey, what could you
possibly still have to figure out?

05:30.538 --> 05:32.999
She is talking about killing someone.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.169
I'm-- I'm trying to figure out
a way to keep us all safe.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.882
-Would you take me to the motel?
-[Wendy] Oh, come on, Jonah!

05:40.965 --> 05:43.551
-[Charlotte] Sure.
-Can you just-- can you give us a second?

05:43.634 --> 05:44.469
Jonah!

05:52.810 --> 05:53.770
I'm right.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.357
No, you're just-- you're being emotional.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.776
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I'm sorry, okay?

05:59.859 --> 06:02.278
-I'll rip your tongue out of your mouth!
-I'm sorry. I just--

06:02.362 --> 06:05.239
-Come on! Emotional!
-[Marty] We need to talk practically.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.532
That's what I am doing.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.993
If Javi dies,
we have no leverage against Navarro.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.204
-He's not gonna die.
-[Wendy] We're as good as dead.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.748
You're the one
who's always preaching safety!

06:13.831 --> 06:17.043
-[Marty] Uh-huh.
-The safe thing is to tell him about Ruth.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.963
-Why can't you admit that?
-Because it's bullshit, Wendy.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.800
This isn't about safety.
This is about the foundation, right?

06:23.883 --> 06:27.470
This is about you trying to do everything
to make sure nothing threatens the deal.

06:29.055 --> 06:34.560
Do I want Javi to die
and fuck up everything we've sacrificed?

06:34.644 --> 06:35.478
No.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.980
Even more of a reason to warn him.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.483
I-I won't get her killed, Wendy, okay?

06:41.692 --> 06:43.569
She'd be getting herself killed.

06:44.153 --> 06:44.987
Wow.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.989
[Wendy] I know you care about her.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.326
You know me. You might not believe it,
but I care about her too.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.704
She's just-- she's not thinking
about what might happen to us.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.749
Mm-hmm. Well, she's distracted.
Her cousin just got murdered.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.544
She's trying to fucking kill the man.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.296

what the guy looks like.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.424

07:04.507 --> 07:06.843
And even if she does,
how's she gonna get to him?

46:00.841 --> 46:03.886
and we've managed to talk her
into giving you the stock options.

She's-- she's drawing up the paperwork,
so, if you could swing by,

46:08.849 --> 46:12.644
we could get it in your hands
before you fly back to Mexico tomorrow.

46:14.438 --> 46:15.272
Great.

46:16.273 --> 46:17.441
See you soon.

We'll put some champagne on ice.

You don't have to do this.

You can be something else.

46:40.047 --> 46:41.089
She knows.

46:45.928 --> 46:47.888
I'm so sorry we let you down.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.547
Felicidades. Please--

49:26.004 --> 49:27.547
How much of that was true?

49:28.882 --> 49:30.842
We need to wipe down every surface.
