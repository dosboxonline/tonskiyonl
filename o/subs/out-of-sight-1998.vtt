34:14.251 --> 34:16.333
I am not turning myself in!

34:16.918 --> 34:18.583
Get off at that exit! What exit?

34:18.668 --> 34:20.001
That exit right there!

34:20.083 --> 34:21.208

34:31.708 --> 34:34.458
<i>paramedics were pulling me</i>
<i>out of the car.</i>

34:36.043 --> 34:38.168
<i>There's a couple of points</i>
<i>I wonder about</i>

34:38.251 --> 34:40.208
<i>concerning the two guys</i>

34:40.293 --> 34:44.126
Buddy, is it?
And this fella Jack Foley.

34:44.418 --> 34:48.083
The man must have robbed
over 200 banks in his time.

34:48.376 --> 34:49.458
Really?

34:49.583 --> 34:52.418
He told me he didn't
remember how many he robbed.

34:52.543 --> 34:54.418
Then you talked to him.

34:55.043 --> 34:56.751
In the trunk, yeah.

34:57.418 --> 34:59.251
What'd you talk about?

35:00.084 --> 35:01.751
Different things.

35:02.168 --> 35:05.251
Prison, movies.

35:06.376 --> 35:09.834
This fella holds you hostage,
you talk about movies?

35:12.084 --> 35:14.376
It was an unusual experience.

35:15.043 --> 35:18.168
Foley made me think
of that fella Carl Tillman.

35:18.251 --> 35:21.251
You were seeing him, it turns
out while he was robbing banks.

35:21.334 --> 35:22.501
Do you recall that?

35:22.584 --> 35:23.668
And what happened to Carl?

35:23.751 --> 35:27.918
You shot him. But you didn't
shoot Foley or his friend.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.584
They're unarmed.
You had a shotgun

35:30.668 --> 35:32.751
and you let them
throw you in the trunk.

35:33.084 --> 35:35.751
You got your SIG in your hand.

35:35.834 --> 35:39.293
You say in the report that
you couldn't turn around.

35:39.418 --> 35:41.084
But when the trunk opened,

35:41.168 --> 35:43.709
how come you
didn't cap them then?

35:43.918 --> 35:45.334
What do you usually work on?

35:45.418 --> 35:47.668
Fraud? Crooked bookkeepers?

35:47.793 --> 35:52.334
I've been with the Bureau 15 years
on all kinds of investigations.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.418
Ever shot a man? No.

35:55.084 --> 35:57.126

35:57.209 --> 35:58.501
I have to qualify?

35:58.584 --> 36:00.418

36:00.501 --> 36:02.418
[MARSHALL CHUCKLING]

36:05.376 --> 36:07.918
We'll talk another time.
All right?

36:10.918 --> 36:13.418
I wonder why Foley
put you in that second car

36:13.501 --> 36:15.793
when he didn't need you anymore.

36:17.459 --> 36:20.584
You'll have to ask him that.

36:36.959 --> 36:38.168

36:38.251 --> 36:39.543
Hi, Maurice.

Fuck it, man.

36:45.084 --> 36:46.959

36:47.418 --> 36:52.334
Not so fast. Starting out, there's
gonna be a cost of living increase.

36:54.334 --> 36:56.751

36:56.834 --> 36:59.126
I didn't really get
no props for that.

But ever since I shanked that
loudmouth pussy in the yard,

37:02.959 --> 37:06.584
it's like my Dun and Broadstreet
shot way the fuck up.

37:06.793 --> 37:09.251
Actually,
it's Dun and Bradstreet.

37:10.793 --> 37:12.918
Well, I've heard it both ways.

37:13.126 --> 37:15.626
Point is, the price

some business to talk about.

37:21.418 --> 37:24.501

I say they was gonna be?

37:24.584 --> 37:25.876
Two thousand.

Now they're three thousand.

Now they're three thousand.

37:41.918 --> 37:44.418
Yeah, you do.
And that extra pillow.

37:44.501 --> 37:47.793
I'm gonna get that for you, but
that's gonna be like five C's.

This is the dumbest shakedown in
the history of dumb shakedowns.

38:04.209 --> 38:06.334
Five hundred bucks for a pillow?

38:06.501 --> 38:07.959

38:08.043 --> 38:09.501
Shut up, Dick.

38:30.918 --> 38:33.834
If he kills you,
he gets nothing.

38:34.793 --> 38:37.793
The man don't just
have to die, Foley.

38:37.876 --> 38:41.668
He could accidentally hurt himself
by falling on something hard.

38:41.751 --> 38:44.084
Like a shiv. Or my dick.

38:45.709 --> 38:48.084
I'll pay. I'll pay it.
Don't worry.

40:14.126 --> 40:15.751
Just that she got away. Here.

40:22.584 --> 40:24.626
I don't know. You'll
have to ask Glenn.

40:24.709 --> 40:27.293
He's probably on his way to Detroit,
which is where we should be.

works for law enforcement?

40:38.293 --> 40:39.918
Do you think this
old guy's her boyfriend?

40:39.959 --> 40:41.751
It's the only photo she has.

40:41.834 --> 40:44.126
Am I going to Detroit by myself?

40:44.251 --> 40:46.668
The longer we stay here,
the better the chance

40:46.751 --> 40:48.668
that either Glenn screws up,

40:48.751 --> 40:50.751

he's done is work on his boat.

I heard a lot about you.

Was it Foley?

42:07.418 --> 42:08.584

Linares goes nuts, starts
shooting, so we took him out.

RAY: No, strictly Cubans.

How you know that?

01:10:08.043 --> 01:10:09.168
I can tell.

01:10:09.251 --> 01:10:10.251
I was.

01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:15.084
'Til I got my retina
detached two times.

01:10:16.543 --> 01:10:18.876
What'd you fight,
about middleweight?

01:10:18.959 --> 01:10:20.001
Light.

01:10:20.459 --> 01:10:23.418
Super middleweight,
once my body developed.

01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:27.334
What you go about,
what, a bantam?

01:10:27.418 --> 01:10:28.459
Flyweight.

01:10:29.251 --> 01:10:31.959
Nigger, what?
You know your divisions.

01:10:33.293 --> 01:10:36.584
Do you like the fights?
You like the rough stuff?

01:10:37.084 --> 01:10:38.459
I bet you do.

01:10:39.751 --> 01:10:41.876
You like to get down
and tussle a little bit?

01:10:41.959 --> 01:10:44.959
Like me and Tuffy,
before she got run over.

01:10:45.293 --> 01:10:48.334
We'd get down on the floor
and tussle all the time.

01:10:48.418 --> 01:10:53.126
I'd say to her, "You a good bitch, Tuffy.
Here's a treat for ya."

01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:56.709
I'd give Tuffy what all
good bitches love best,

01:10:56.793 --> 01:10:57.876
and you know what that is?

01:10:59.376 --> 01:11:01.959
Know what that is? A bone.

01:11:03.876 --> 01:11:06.168
I'll give you
a good bone too, girl.

01:11:06.251 --> 01:11:08.043
You're not my type.

01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:10.459
That shit don't mean
nothin' to me.

01:11:10.793 --> 01:11:13.168
I let the monster out,
you do what it wants.

01:11:13.251 --> 01:11:14.501
I gotta go.

01:11:14.751 --> 01:11:16.209
Maybe we'll see
each other again.

01:11:16.293 --> 01:11:17.751
No, we gonna tussle first.

01:11:20.751 --> 01:11:23.543
Damn it! What the fuck was that?

01:11:23.626 --> 01:11:25.876
You wanted to tussle.
We tussled.

01:11:30.918 --> 01:11:32.501
BUDDY: That's a big ass house.

01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:34.418
JACK: Place almost
looks like a prison.

01:11:34.543 --> 01:11:36.751
BUDDY: No doubt he's got some
serious security system.

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.501
Time comes,
we knock on the door,

01:11:38.584 --> 01:11:40.501
see if he wants to
discuss old times.

01:11:40.584 --> 01:11:42.418
The easy way. Cool.

01:11:43.043 --> 01:11:46.668
Think he'll let us in with Snoop
and that musclebound asshole?

01:11:46.751 --> 01:11:48.334
Nobody's gonna be with us.

01:11:48.418 --> 01:11:51.501
We go to the fights tomorrow
night, hear Snoopy's big plan,

01:11:51.584 --> 01:11:53.751
then we go in
ahead of him. Alone.

01:11:55.043 --> 01:11:56.168
I can dig it.

01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:59.834
Glenn deals with the Snoop, while
we off livin' the good life.

01:11:59.918 --> 01:12:02.334
You know anybody who's
done one last big score

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:04.668
and then gone on
to live the good life?

01:12:04.751 --> 01:12:07.584
There's a chance we'll walk
out of here with nothin'.

01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:09.584
I say, let fate decide.

01:12:09.876 --> 01:12:12.584
Fate? Who are you, the
fuckin' Dalai Lama now?

01:12:12.668 --> 01:12:13.793
It's my sister.

01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:16.626
My sister believes
in fate but not hell.

01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:18.834
That's why she stopped praying
for all the lost souls,

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:21.084
since you don't hear
about Purgatory anymore.

01:12:21.168 --> 01:12:24.501
But every day, she prays
that Buddy don't fuck up.

01:12:26.001 --> 01:12:27.126
What do you think?

01:12:28.376 --> 01:12:29.501
Do you think there's a hell?

01:12:30.168 --> 01:12:32.584
It's called the Glades
Correctional Institute.

01:12:32.668 --> 01:12:35.626
I'm not going back there,
or any place like it.

01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:37.418
They put a gun on you,
you'll go, brother.

01:12:39.168 --> 01:12:41.501
They put a gun on you,
you still have a choice.

01:12:46.084 --> 01:12:48.501
MAN: So, Mr. Foley.

01:12:48.918 --> 01:12:52.168
Mr. Ripley and I
have had a long talk

01:12:52.251 --> 01:12:53.293
about your role in the company.

01:12:53.334 --> 01:12:56.084
He felt you'd be happiest
working here in Miami.

01:12:56.168 --> 01:12:57.459
How's that sound to you?

01:12:57.543 --> 01:12:58.584
Great.

01:12:58.918 --> 01:13:01.418
Good. You're about
a 42 long, right?

01:13:04.459 --> 01:13:06.043
I'm about a 42.

01:13:07.918 --> 01:13:09.626
Like, 42 regular.

01:13:17.876 --> 01:13:19.418
Let's see how she fits.

01:13:19.501 --> 01:13:20.543
What is that?

01:13:20.626 --> 01:13:22.084
Your uniform.

01:13:24.751 --> 01:13:26.084
My uniform.

01:13:29.918 --> 01:13:32.418
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

01:13:35.751 --> 01:13:37.751
You can't go in there!
A security guard?

01:13:37.834 --> 01:13:38.876
What are you, stoned?

01:13:38.959 --> 01:13:40.668
Hey. Take it easy!

01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:43.418
It's all right, Peggy.
It's under control.

01:13:46.918 --> 01:13:50.084
I wasn't sure that you'd show up
here, but I was sure if you did,

01:13:50.168 --> 01:13:52.459
you'd throw this job in my face.

01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:54.584
Let me tell you something.

01:13:54.668 --> 01:13:57.959
Every single thing you've done
with your life up to this point

01:13:58.084 --> 01:14:00.376
in the real world means nothing.

01:14:00.876 --> 01:14:02.543
Less than nothing.

01:14:02.876 --> 01:14:04.709
You're a bank robber.

01:14:05.043 --> 01:14:07.418
That's not a very
marketable skill.

01:14:07.793 --> 01:14:10.501
We don't see a lot of old
bank robbers walking around

01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:12.793
with a pension plan, now do we?

01:14:13.584 --> 01:14:16.751
I think you know this.
That's why you're here.

01:14:16.918 --> 01:14:18.376
Today, I've offered you

01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:20.751
a lousy job with a lousy wage.

01:14:21.918 --> 01:14:25.251
You want something better?
Show me you can change.

01:14:26.584 --> 01:14:29.584
Then I'll offer you something better.
A lot better.

01:14:29.751 --> 01:14:32.751
Until then, my friend,
you'll have to earn it.

01:14:34.126 --> 01:14:36.209
How, Dick? The way you earn it?

01:14:37.084 --> 01:14:39.168
Married some rich broad
owns the company,

01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:41.501
selling it, then divorcing her?

01:14:41.584 --> 01:14:45.376
What's this "pull yourself up
by the bootstraps" bullshit?

01:14:46.084 --> 01:14:49.001
Back in prison, a guy like
you in a place like that?

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:52.501
You were ice cream for freaks.
A goddamned dumpling.

01:14:52.584 --> 01:14:54.251
Maurice and a dozen other guys

01:14:54.334 --> 01:14:56.126
would have bled you
till you had nothing.

01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:59.334
Until you were nothing.
I saved your ass!

01:14:59.418 --> 01:15:02.001
So pardon me if I
won't sit on a stool,

01:15:02.084 --> 01:15:05.876
and say, "Sign in here, please,"
or "You can't park here."

01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:08.001
I can't fuckin' do it, Dick!

01:15:08.168 --> 01:15:09.251
I'm disappointed in you.

01:15:10.918 --> 01:15:13.168
Here we go. What job did
he promise you boys?

01:15:13.251 --> 01:15:14.376
There's two ways we can do this.

01:15:14.418 --> 01:15:15.459
What are they?

01:16:00.293 --> 01:16:04.418
I gotta get a better pair of shoes
and some things for tomorrow.

01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:06.126
Let's hook up later.

01:16:06.209 --> 01:16:07.293
Yeah, okay.

01:16:09.084 --> 01:16:10.584
I better go call my sister.

WAITRESS:
Can I get you anything?

01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:31.709
I'll have a bourbon. Water back.

Why don't you do us again?

01:16:39.418 --> 01:16:42.251
Celeste, put the lady's drink
on our bill.

01:16:53.793 --> 01:16:55.334
They want to buy
your drink for you.

01:16:55.418 --> 01:16:57.001
I get that.

01:16:57.084 --> 01:16:58.584
Tell them I'd rather pay
for my own.

01:16:58.668 --> 01:17:00.084
Okay.

01:17:04.084 --> 01:17:05.584
I'll find out.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:14.376
Excuse me. My associates and
I, we made a little bet

01:17:14.459 --> 01:17:16.209
on what you do for a living.

01:17:16.293 --> 01:17:19.293
And I won. Hi, I'm Philip.

01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:22.834
I'd rather just have
a quiet drink and leave.

01:17:23.751 --> 01:17:25.834
Don't you want to
know what I guessed?

01:17:25.918 --> 01:17:27.209
How I know what
you do for a living?

01:17:27.251 --> 01:17:30.251
I don't want to be rude.

If I can offer my observation.

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:55.418
I got a hunch
you're the new sales rep,

01:17:55.959 --> 01:18:00.293

out by the fact that a young lady,

Tell me, Celeste, what
do you do for a living?

I'm a sales rep, and I came
here to call on a customer,

As a sales rep? As a girl.

01:20:12.626 --> 01:20:13.876
I don't have a problem with it.

01:20:13.918 --> 01:20:15.043
I like your hair.

No.

I never played this game before.

01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:39.293
It's not a game.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:41.501
It's not something you play.

01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:43.793
Does this make any sense to you?

01:20:43.918 --> 01:20:47.084
It doesn't have to. It's
something that happens.

01:20:47.168 --> 01:20:49.584
It's like seeing
someone for the first time

01:20:49.668 --> 01:20:51.876
like you could be
passing on the street,

01:20:52.251 --> 01:20:54.709
and you look at each other
and for a few seconds

01:20:54.793 --> 01:20:58.959
there's this kind of a recognition...
Like you both know something.

01:20:59.043 --> 01:21:01.126
The next moment,
the person's gone,

01:21:01.209 --> 01:21:04.084
and it's too late to
do anything about it.

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:07.418
You always remember it, because
it was there, and you let it go.

01:21:07.543 --> 01:21:10.584
You think to yourself,
"What if I had stopped?"

01:21:11.043 --> 01:21:12.251
"What if?"

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:18.001
And it may only happen
a few times in your life.

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.084
Or once.

01:53:18.376 --> 01:53:21.376
<i>picking up where your</i>
<i>"interlude" left off,</i>

01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:24.584
<i>then you can throw him</i>
<i>in the shithouse.</i>

01:53:25.793 --> 01:53:27.918
KAREN: <i>He knew</i>
<i>what he was doing.</i>

01:53:28.043 --> 01:53:30.418
<i>Nobody forced him to rob banks.</i>

01:53:32.251 --> 01:53:35.084
<i>MARSHALL: My little girl.</i>
<i>The tough babe.</i>

01:53:36.876 --> 01:53:38.626
<i>KAREN: I'll call you later.</i>

01:53:38.751 --> 01:53:40.084
<i>MARSHALL: Good-bye.</i>

01:53:57.918 --> 01:53:58.918
KAREN: Jack.

01:54:03.168 --> 01:54:04.918
I got you a present.

01:54:07.918 --> 01:54:09.293
Something for the road.

01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:23.668
I'm gonna have
to take it away, though,

01:54:23.751 --> 01:54:25.876
soon as the ride is over.

01:54:38.459 --> 01:54:40.793
OFFICER: Jack Foley?
Meet Hejira Henry.

01:54:52.751 --> 01:54:54.376
What kind of a name is Hejira?

01:54:54.459 --> 01:54:55.709
It's Islamic.

01:54:55.793 --> 01:54:57.043
What's it stand for?

01:54:57.709 --> 01:55:01.209
The "Hejira" was Muhammad's
flight from Mecca in 622.

01:55:01.501 --> 01:55:02.751
His flight?

01:55:03.334 --> 01:55:06.251
Brothers in Leavenworth
gave me that name.

01:55:06.584 --> 01:55:08.043
You were in Leavenworth?

01:55:08.126 --> 01:55:09.918
For a time. Meaning?

01:55:10.626 --> 01:55:12.793
Meaning, the time came, I left.

01:55:12.876 --> 01:55:13.918
You busted out.

01:55:14.251 --> 01:55:18.334
I prefer to think of it as an
exodus from an undesirable place.

01:55:20.543 --> 01:55:22.334
How long before you got caught?

01:55:22.418 --> 01:55:23.543
That time?

01:55:25.293 --> 01:55:26.418
There were others?

01:55:26.501 --> 01:55:28.418
That was the ninth.

01:55:30.543 --> 01:55:31.876
The ninth?

01:55:33.584 --> 01:55:37.334
Ten if you count that prison
hospital I walked away from.

01:55:37.501 --> 01:55:38.668
You done a lot
of walkin', Henry.

01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:39.793
Hejira.

01:55:39.918 --> 01:55:43.459
Hejira. Now we're off to Glades.

01:55:44.834 --> 01:55:46.501
It looks that way.

01:55:47.334 --> 01:55:50.709
I was supposed to leave last
night with the lady marshal.

01:55:50.793 --> 01:55:53.418
For some reason
she wanted to wait.

01:55:53.834 --> 01:55:54.918
JACK: She did?

01:55:55.001 --> 01:55:57.251
Guess it's cheaper
taking us in one van.

01:55:58.418 --> 01:56:02.918
Could be. Maybe she thought
we had a lot to talk about.

01:56:03.459 --> 01:56:05.126
Really? Like what?

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:10.418
I don't know.
Long ride to Florida.
