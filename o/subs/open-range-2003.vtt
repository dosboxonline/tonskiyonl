01:05.990 --> 01:08.534
Think she'll get over thisaway?

01:12.080 --> 01:13.915
Might.

01:13.957 --> 01:16.084
Best bed them down.

02:10.514 --> 02:12.183
Come on, Tig.

02:53.308 --> 02:55.310
There she goes.

03:00.232 --> 03:02.443
Looks like we're in for it.

03:21.045 --> 03:22.713
You see them?

03:25.759 --> 03:29.387
Can't see them.
Can't hear them.

03:29.428 --> 03:31.889
You ever seen one this bad?

03:31.932 --> 03:34.476
Not since Noah and the flood.

03:34.558 --> 03:39.272
Well, you should know, Boss,
since you was there.

03:39.313 --> 03:41.400
What did you say?

03:41.482 --> 03:45.404
He said, "You should know
since you was there. "

03:50.993 --> 03:53.870
Well, even that
wasn't this damn wet.

03:53.954 --> 03:55.372
One thing's certain.

03:55.455 --> 04:00.460
Noah never shoveled as much bull
from them he had aboard.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.463
Let's rustle up some grub.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.507
Mose?

04:05.591 --> 04:07.092
Hey!

04:09.637 --> 04:11.263
- That hurt?
- Yeah.

04:11.305 --> 04:13.349
Mose, still got them cards?

04:13.432 --> 04:15.434
Yeah, I got them.

04:15.518 --> 04:18.894
Get them out, and let's have us
a game after breakfast.

04:31.576 --> 04:32.869
Button!

04:34.537 --> 04:36.456
Pull them plates under here.

04:39.584 --> 04:43.713
You gonna play them cards, Mose,
or stare a hole through them?

04:43.796 --> 04:45.923
Don't rush me.

04:49.135 --> 04:51.554
I'll take four.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.682
Oh, for pity's sakes.
"Take four. "

05:01.231 --> 05:04.526
All right, that's it.

05:04.568 --> 05:05.861
I'm out.

05:07.236 --> 05:08.906
Me too.

05:14.161 --> 05:17.206
A man's trust
is a valuable thing, Button.

05:17.289 --> 05:20.334
You don't want to lose it
for a handful of cards.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.895
Well, at least it ain't raining.

06:22.690 --> 06:26.067
Get yourself dressed, Button.
Help Mose get things cleaned up.

06:26.109 --> 06:29.739
Then you walk out
and look for them horses.

06:42.626 --> 06:46.005
Looks like you could use
a little muscle there, Charley.

06:49.967 --> 06:53.304
You just keep on like you are.

06:53.387 --> 06:56.557
You'll get your chance
soon enough.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.316
No need to ask
for more chores, Mose.

07:04.398 --> 07:06.525
Every man's got to pull
his weight.

07:06.610 --> 07:09.738
Yeah, but my weight
is half of yours.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.953
You know, it's hard to figure
Charley sometimes.

07:16.994 --> 07:19.373
I ain't even sure
if he likes me.

07:19.455 --> 07:21.457
He likes you.

07:22.542 --> 07:28.006
You know, Boss had some pause
about hiring me on.

07:28.048 --> 07:32.094
Too big to get around on horses
and work them cows.

07:32.177 --> 07:34.888
Afraid I'd eat too much.

07:34.971 --> 07:36.848
It was Charley
that talked him into it,

07:36.932 --> 07:39.351
and I ain't one to take
a man's confidence lightly.

07:39.434 --> 07:40.644
You know I ain't, either.

07:40.687 --> 07:43.564
I know you ain't, but it's best
to keep remembering it

07:43.647 --> 07:45.149
if you want respect

07:45.190 --> 07:48.319
when you're riding with men
like Charley and Boss.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.853
Button, pull.

08:22.061 --> 08:23.272
Pull it.

08:23.354 --> 08:25.523
Button!

08:25.566 --> 08:26.859
Button!

08:26.899 --> 08:30.528
Quit playing with that dog
and pull the wagon!

08:35.909 --> 08:37.452
Pull it!

08:43.375 --> 08:46.211
- Pull!
- Oh, yeah!

08:46.253 --> 08:48.964
Yeah.
That's it.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.518
Hey, hey!
Look at that!

09:33.176 --> 09:35.887
Old Boss sure can cowboy,
can't he?

09:37.013 --> 09:38.473
Yeah.

09:38.515 --> 09:40.851
Broke the mold after him.

09:55.156 --> 09:57.076
Main bunch is working
towards water.

09:57.158 --> 09:58.910
We'll go up-country,
find the rest,

09:58.994 --> 10:00.745
and we'll push them there.

10:03.164 --> 10:05.001
Look at that.

10:07.003 --> 10:09.588
A couple of damn kids.

10:09.672 --> 10:10.965
Anyway, once we get them,

10:11.007 --> 10:14.010
we can start driving them back
closer to camp.

10:14.092 --> 10:16.554
It'll be a while
before we see another town.

10:16.637 --> 10:19.306
Could use supplies,
coffee and such.

10:20.474 --> 10:21.559
Mose!

10:21.642 --> 10:23.185
Ow!

10:23.269 --> 10:24.687
Mose!

10:29.442 --> 10:32.445
You'll have to ride back
to that town we passed.

10:32.528 --> 10:34.280
When you want me to go?

10:34.364 --> 10:36.199
Tonight.

10:36.282 --> 10:38.243
I'll go.

10:38.326 --> 10:39.494
I can go.

10:39.536 --> 10:42.247
How long you figure, Charley?

10:42.330 --> 10:45.584
Without cows slowing things,
maybe one day there, one back.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.209
Sounds about right.

10:47.294 --> 10:48.502
Come on, Boss.

10:48.545 --> 10:49.713
I can do it.

10:49.795 --> 10:51.340
Sure you can, boy.

10:51.423 --> 10:52.965
Just don't know
if that town's ready

10:53.050 --> 10:56.178
to have you
turned loose on it just yet.

10:57.471 --> 10:58.805
English!

10:58.889 --> 11:00.515
Damn! Shit!

11:00.599 --> 11:02.225
Bullshit!

12:15.801 --> 12:18.637
By God, if you're gonna pick
your feet like a monkey,

12:18.679 --> 12:20.889
you do it downwind.

12:23.809 --> 12:27.146
Swear to God, old Tig
takes better care of herself.

12:28.564 --> 12:29.815
Starting to think
it was a mistake

12:29.898 --> 12:32.109
not getting you on in some town
to learn a trade.

12:32.151 --> 12:34.654
I don't like towns.
Never liked them.

12:34.695 --> 12:37.365
Oh, you're just saying that
'cause you heard me say it.

12:37.448 --> 12:39.408
Get yourself a trade
and set up in a town.

12:39.491 --> 12:41.368
You'll always have
a roof over your head,

12:41.452 --> 12:42.537
a bed up off the ground,

12:42.619 --> 12:45.622
and food no further away
than a cafÃ©.

12:46.373 --> 12:48.418
Ain't that so, Charley?

12:51.378 --> 12:52.756
That was a big help.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.008
Might as well be talking
to this horse.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.803
Put your boot on, Button.
Let's go to work.

13:01.473 --> 13:04.517
Course, if you was to live
in a town...

13:05.685 --> 13:07.895
You'd have to clean up some.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.483
Otherwise, no one
could stand the stink.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.037
What you do that for?!

13:30.461 --> 13:32.671
Cheating at cards.

13:38.928 --> 13:40.179
Cheating.

13:40.261 --> 13:42.430
I apologized to you for that!

13:43.557 --> 13:46.435
Eh, Boss?
I apologized to him for that.

13:46.519 --> 13:49.146
Evidently he ain't over it yet.

14:08.541 --> 14:11.210
It's getting dark, Boss.

14:11.294 --> 14:14.797
He could have got hurt
between that town and the camp.

14:14.881 --> 14:17.258
Probably just taking his time.

14:17.299 --> 14:20.136
Don't suppose he got into
a poker game, do you?

14:20.220 --> 14:23.431
Wouldn't gamble
your money, Boss.

14:23.515 --> 14:27.144
What if he's lying out there
waiting for us to come along?

14:27.227 --> 14:30.939
We'd never find him tonight.
Now, come on down from there.

14:31.023 --> 14:32.773
He's worried.

14:32.858 --> 14:35.027
- You worried?
- Yeah, I'm worried.

14:35.110 --> 14:38.823
Been worried since yesterday.
Should have sent me.

14:38.905 --> 14:40.991
Mose can look out for himself.

14:41.074 --> 14:43.076
Then why ain't he here with us?

14:43.118 --> 14:45.997
Well, you never was
wanting to go to towns.

14:46.079 --> 14:48.415
Well, I don't want to go now
neither.

14:48.458 --> 14:51.336
But we better find him,
wherever he is.

14:54.379 --> 14:56.049
All right.

14:56.131 --> 14:59.344
You and me strike out early.
Button can watch the outfit.

14:59.426 --> 15:03.681
Button, come on down from there
and get supper a-working.

15:14.442 --> 15:17.111
Most likely be back
before suppertime.

15:17.153 --> 15:19.113
But three sets of eyes,
it's better than two.

15:19.155 --> 15:22.241
- You stay with the wagon.
- Come on, Boss.

15:22.325 --> 15:23.576
No one is gonna bother it.

15:23.660 --> 15:26.746
We haven't seen a single person
since we set up the camp.

15:26.829 --> 15:29.916
I always feel better
if someone's close around.

15:29.999 --> 15:33.878
You been working hard,
deserve a little loafing time.

15:33.961 --> 15:35.838
Stay right here.

15:38.883 --> 15:40.344
Stay, Tig.

15:40.426 --> 15:41.512
Wants to go.

15:41.594 --> 15:44.180
She acts like she does,
but she don't.

15:44.264 --> 15:47.935
Still got the heart,
not the legs.

15:49.185 --> 15:51.689
You keep that rifle close.

17:02.427 --> 17:06.223
Always liked me a sidearm
with some heft.

17:06.265 --> 17:10.060
Took this off a man who couldn't
pay all he owed for some cows.

17:10.102 --> 17:11.935
Damn fine weapon.

17:13.439 --> 17:16.483
Always noticed you favor
something light, don't you?

17:38.422 --> 17:41.759
Set it right down.
Thank you.

18:31.935 --> 18:33.312
Hello!

18:38.651 --> 18:41.111
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

18:41.195 --> 18:44.156
Like to feed and water them,
curry them down with saddles on.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.327
Okay, that'll be four bits each.

18:47.368 --> 18:49.829
- There you go.
- Thank you.

18:50.788 --> 18:52.290
Not planning on staying long?

18:52.373 --> 18:54.584
Long as it takes to find
who we're looking for.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.753
Maybe I can help you gents.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.172
I been here since Harmonville
was Fort Harmon

18:59.213 --> 19:01.383
and we still had soldiers
to chase off Indians.

19:01.466 --> 19:05.094
I know everybody in town
and for miles beyond.

19:05.178 --> 19:09.182
Big man needing a haircut,
about 30.

19:09.266 --> 19:11.517
That's his rig right there.

19:15.521 --> 19:18.858
Oh, yeah.
Know who you're talking about.

19:18.901 --> 19:20.568
Very friendly young fella.

19:20.653 --> 19:23.530
Looks like he's been living out
of saddlebags most of his life.

19:23.571 --> 19:25.573
Got his horse in the corral.

19:25.658 --> 19:27.076
Ride with you, does he?

19:27.117 --> 19:28.911
Know where we can find him?

19:28.994 --> 19:30.412
Yeah.

19:30.454 --> 19:32.206
Yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.

19:32.247 --> 19:35.376
He got into it
with some cattlemen

19:35.459 --> 19:36.752
over at the general store.

19:36.835 --> 19:38.504
- Some cattlemen.
- Yeah.

19:38.587 --> 19:40.214
Busted them up pretty bad, too,

19:40.297 --> 19:42.174
before Marshal Poole came up

19:42.257 --> 19:44.385
and hit him over the head
with his gun barrel.

19:44.426 --> 19:47.888
Yeah, he's lucky he
didn't get shot in the back.

19:47.930 --> 19:49.973
You might want to keep that
in mind

19:50.057 --> 19:52.101
when you're talking
to Marshal Poole.

19:52.184 --> 19:53.977
Saddle his horse.

19:54.061 --> 19:55.354
That cover what he owes?

19:55.438 --> 19:56.606
Oh, yeah.

19:56.689 --> 19:59.609
Name's Percy if you should need
anything else.

19:59.651 --> 20:01.110
Much obliged.

20:01.194 --> 20:02.736
Hold on.

20:13.289 --> 20:15.000
How long you had him here?

20:15.083 --> 20:18.086
I brought him in here
yesterday afternoon.

20:18.169 --> 20:20.588
It wasn't easy
getting him into the cell.

20:20.630 --> 20:21.756
Why is that?

20:21.798 --> 20:24.509
Goddamn bear.
Size of it.

20:26.761 --> 20:30.640
Evening.
Name's Boss Spearman.

20:30.682 --> 20:32.727
This here's Charley Waite.

20:32.809 --> 20:34.437
Evening.

20:35.021 --> 20:36.563
Believe you have
a friend of ours.

20:36.646 --> 20:39.816
Name's Mose Harrison.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.860
Yeah, I got him here.

20:41.944 --> 20:45.948
He started a fight
in the general store.

20:46.031 --> 20:49.869
Mose don't start fights,
just finishes them.

20:49.952 --> 20:53.331
I just said he started it.
You said he didn't.

20:53.372 --> 20:54.832
Maybe you're calling me a liar.

20:54.874 --> 20:56.709
You got a charge against him?

20:56.791 --> 20:58.544
I got plenty.

20:58.627 --> 21:01.671
Inciting a fight.
Disturbing the peace.

21:01.756 --> 21:04.551
Creating a public nuisance.
Take your pick.

21:04.633 --> 21:06.510
Hear tell he got hit
over the head.

21:09.347 --> 21:10.806
He'll be fine.

21:10.848 --> 21:13.517
Well, I come to get him.

21:13.602 --> 21:18.357
Well, you pay the fines,
and you can have him.

21:18.439 --> 21:23.362
How does $50 each offense sound?

21:23.402 --> 21:25.364
Like robbery.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.909
Lot of money.

21:29.993 --> 21:32.663
Oh, yes, a lot of money.

21:33.538 --> 21:36.082
I been waiting for you,
Mr. Spearman.

21:36.166 --> 21:38.835
My name's Denton Baxter.

21:38.919 --> 21:40.754
Be your men Mose tussled with.

21:40.837 --> 21:42.506
That's right.

21:42.589 --> 21:45.217
You know, folks
in Fort Harmon country

21:45.300 --> 21:48.929
don't take to free grazers
or free grazing.

21:49.013 --> 21:52.099
They hate them more than they
used to hate the Indians.

21:52.182 --> 21:56.187
I expect by "folks,"
you mean ranchers like yourself.

21:58.021 --> 22:00.191
I got the biggest spread around.

22:00.233 --> 22:02.360
Bigger than any three or four
put together.

22:02.442 --> 22:04.529
Built it up with me own
two hands,

22:04.569 --> 22:06.406
piece by piece,

22:06.446 --> 22:08.782
along with this town.

22:08.865 --> 22:10.535
And there ain't no
free-graze cattle

22:10.617 --> 22:13.328
gonna take the feed
off my cattle on this range.

22:13.413 --> 22:15.039
Free graze is legal.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.333
Times change, Mr. Spearman.

22:17.417 --> 22:21.421
Most folks change with them.
A few holdouts never do.

22:23.547 --> 22:24.757
You know, a few years back,

22:24.840 --> 22:27.552
a free-graze outfit
came through.

22:27.593 --> 22:30.680
One night,
the cattle got stampeded,

22:30.763 --> 22:33.975
the wagons caught on fire,
and one of those boys

22:34.058 --> 22:36.936
was shot off his horse
in the middle of it all.

22:37.020 --> 22:39.356
Shot in the back, was he?

22:43.860 --> 22:47.656
Your man's horse and rig
are at the livery barn.

22:47.739 --> 22:50.242
You can take him with you
when you leave tonight.

22:50.325 --> 22:52.870
And come sunrise,
you hitch up your wagon

22:52.953 --> 22:55.039
and get your damn
free-graze cattle moving

22:55.122 --> 22:58.791
and keep them moving till you're
out of Fort Harmon country!

22:59.959 --> 23:02.713
Now, you let Mr. Spearman
fetch his man

23:02.796 --> 23:05.215
so he can be on his way.

23:24.568 --> 23:26.612
Charley.

23:31.325 --> 23:32.910
- Mose.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.455
Mose.

23:38.791 --> 23:42.420
Looks like someone's put the
boots to him after he was down.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.837
Does it?

23:49.344 --> 23:51.346
Mose, you gotta get up.

23:51.388 --> 23:55.684
Charley, I'm glad to see you.

23:56.976 --> 23:59.020
I don't much like this town.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.651
Here you go.

24:05.276 --> 24:07.697
Boy, they really lit into him.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.197
You got a doctor in this town?

24:09.240 --> 24:11.283
Yeah.
Doc Barlow.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.828
It's the house up behind
the barn by the church.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.579
Look for a picket fence.

24:15.662 --> 24:18.165
He's got a sign out front.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.003
Oh, my.
Bring him right in.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.261
Lay him down in there.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.606
I'll fetch the doctor.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.192
Get his legs, Boss.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.069
Easy, easy.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.448
Good.

24:57.456 --> 24:58.915
I'm Dr. Barlow.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.833
Boss Spearman.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.170
Charley Waite.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.921
Patient there's Mose Harrison.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.548
He works for me.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.091
These wounds are old.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.135
Easier to treat
if you bring him in right away.

25:10.218 --> 25:13.471
Your marshal had him, and he
don't keep a friendly jail.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.224
This is the man who was in the
fight with Dent Baxter's men?

25:16.308 --> 25:19.061
He certainly gave
as good as he got.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.229
Broke the arm of one.

25:21.271 --> 25:24.233
Knowing them,
they had it coming, I expect.

25:25.317 --> 25:26.777
Let's see what we got here.

25:26.819 --> 25:28.236
- Aah!
- Easy.

25:28.279 --> 25:30.489
- Easy, Mose.
- Easy, Mr. Harrison.

25:30.573 --> 25:32.491
Nobody's trying to hurt you
on purpose.

25:32.575 --> 25:34.577
I'd say you got a couple
of broken ribs.

25:34.660 --> 25:37.580
Gonna need to get
this shirt off.

25:46.923 --> 25:50.843
Sue, I am gonna need some soap,
some water, and some alcohol.

25:57.558 --> 26:00.561
I want you to drink this,
Mr. Harrison.

26:00.645 --> 26:03.022
- That's it.

26:06.025 --> 26:08.112
Let's clean up these cuts
on his face.

26:08.152 --> 26:11.531
He's got a nice gash
in his scalp there.

26:11.614 --> 26:12.866
I'd say to good health,

26:12.949 --> 26:14.868
but then I'd probably be out
of business.

26:14.951 --> 26:19.664
We'll drink to good health
for them that have it coming.

26:23.001 --> 26:25.212
The two of you
can wait in the parlor.

26:38.475 --> 26:40.144
Be better he didn't travel.

26:40.226 --> 26:42.771
Well, he'll have to.

26:43.856 --> 26:45.983
How much I owe you, Doctor?

26:46.025 --> 26:47.026
We're even.

26:47.109 --> 26:50.154
I figured I made enough off the
damage he did to Baxter's men.

26:50.237 --> 26:52.698
Wish he'd have made you wealthy.

26:54.199 --> 26:55.367
Ma'am.

27:23.438 --> 27:26.232
Doc Barlow's got him
a pretty wife.

27:26.316 --> 27:28.234
Notice that, did you?

27:28.276 --> 27:30.028
Well, I ain't dead.

27:30.111 --> 27:31.654
Glad to hear it.

27:31.738 --> 27:32.865
Sweet, too.

27:32.906 --> 27:36.284
Treated us as good as anybody.
That's a real lady.

27:36.368 --> 27:38.162
A woman like that makes a man

27:38.244 --> 27:42.083
think about
setting down roots, eh?

27:43.458 --> 27:45.628
Doc looks like a real
hardworking feller.

27:45.710 --> 27:49.215
Probably working away on making
some little ones, too.

27:49.256 --> 27:51.341
Creates quite a picture,
now, don't it?

27:51.425 --> 27:52.551
Yeah.

27:52.592 --> 27:55.220
Heard they're worth
a thousand words.

28:17.284 --> 28:18.953
Hey, Tig.

28:28.337 --> 28:30.716
Now, where do you suppose he is?

28:47.149 --> 28:49.484
Goddamn kid.

28:51.611 --> 28:53.655
Button's all right, Boss.

28:56.867 --> 29:00.120
Anyone done him harm, they'd
have gone through the wagon.

29:00.204 --> 29:03.123
Reckon you're right.

29:07.127 --> 29:09.004
Here he is.

29:09.921 --> 29:11.966
If you're awake,
you might want to see this.

29:12.008 --> 29:14.051
- Where you been?!
- I seen it before.

29:14.135 --> 29:16.137
Out with the herd.

29:16.179 --> 29:18.598
I thought I told you
to stay with the wagon.

29:18.681 --> 29:20.767
- What happened to Mose?
- Did you hear what I said?!

29:20.850 --> 29:23.019
Yeah, but what happened?

29:23.101 --> 29:26.481
Run into a little trouble
in that town.

29:26.522 --> 29:29.442
Looks like more than a little.

29:29.525 --> 29:31.277
Are we moving on?

29:31.361 --> 29:34.947
We always do, don't we,
once we've grazed off a place?

29:43.374 --> 29:44.999
Did I do something wrong?

29:45.084 --> 29:47.086
Just leave him be for a while.

29:47.168 --> 29:49.504
Here.
Have some coffee.

29:49.546 --> 29:51.756
Made fresh, for a change.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.218
There was three riders scouting
up the herd this morning.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.511
Where?

29:56.595 --> 29:58.472
Maybe half a mile out.

29:58.555 --> 30:01.391
Just sitting there,
looking at the cattle.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.736
Same ones?

30:13.779 --> 30:16.156
Four this time.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.033
Country's filling up.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.160
Maybe we should push on.

30:20.244 --> 30:21.870
Do no good, Button.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.498
I seen them like Baxter before.

30:23.580 --> 30:27.126
He means to have this herd
or scatter it to the wind.

30:27.209 --> 30:29.044
If he was gonna take the herd,

30:29.087 --> 30:31.088
why not just keep you in town?

30:31.171 --> 30:33.550
Marshal already had Mose.

30:33.590 --> 30:36.428
Wants us all in one place.

30:36.510 --> 30:38.722
Far from there when it happens.

30:38.762 --> 30:42.434
Don't make no sense, him telling
us to move on and all.

30:42.516 --> 30:45.228
Weren't the only thing he said.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.731
Most time, a man will tell you
his bad intentions

30:47.772 --> 30:51.693
if you listen,
let yourself hear.

30:51.776 --> 30:55.864
A few years back, a free-graze
outfit come through.

30:55.947 --> 30:58.742
That weren't no idle story.

30:58.783 --> 31:00.827
Let's find out for certain.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.009
Beautiful country.

31:57.259 --> 31:59.804
A man can get lost out here,

31:59.888 --> 32:03.849
forget there's people and things
that ain't so simple as this.

32:05.811 --> 32:08.397
How long we been
riding together, Charley?

32:09.356 --> 32:11.400
Nigh on 10 years.

32:11.483 --> 32:13.609
Mm-hmm.

32:13.694 --> 32:17.072
You know what they call that,
call it a decade.

32:17.155 --> 32:19.408
Long time.

32:19.490 --> 32:22.160
Been a lot of change since then.

32:23.870 --> 32:25.997
What's on your mind, Boss?

32:27.332 --> 32:29.918
Way I figure it, we can leave
the cattle and run,

32:30.002 --> 32:32.422
or you and me can go in the dark
and stop them

32:32.504 --> 32:34.840
before they scatter the herd.

32:38.677 --> 32:42.931
You reckon them cows are worth
getting killed over?

32:43.015 --> 32:44.391
The cows is one thing.

32:44.475 --> 32:45.976
But one man telling another

32:46.060 --> 32:49.730
where he can go in this
country's something else.

32:49.814 --> 32:51.732
That rancher sat
in that jailhouse,

32:51.774 --> 32:54.192
sneering and letting
his lawman lay down the law

32:54.235 --> 32:56.738
till he figured
it was time to show us

32:56.779 --> 32:59.115
that he gave the orders
around here.

32:59.197 --> 33:02.535
Ooh, sticks in my craw.

33:06.914 --> 33:09.876
Well, we sure as hell owe them
for what they done to Mose.

33:09.917 --> 33:11.210
Yeah.

33:13.755 --> 33:16.008
I'll saddle the horses.

33:21.220 --> 33:23.556
You two keep a sharp eye out.

33:24.682 --> 33:28.103
Got the scatter-gun.
We'll be watching for them.

33:28.187 --> 33:30.481
You'll want to douse that fire.

33:30.563 --> 33:31.898
Button, keep to the wagon.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.150
I don't want to see you
out in the open.

33:34.234 --> 33:35.735
Okay?

33:40.532 --> 33:43.076
I got some sugar in that town.

33:44.828 --> 33:46.747
It's in the wagon.

34:03.681 --> 34:05.808
I wouldn't want to have him
coming down on me

34:05.891 --> 34:07.601
like these cowboys.

34:07.644 --> 34:09.646
What the hell's the matter
with you, Gus?

34:09.728 --> 34:12.649
You're twitching all damn night.

34:12.690 --> 34:17.529
Damn back's so sore from being
flung into that stove.

34:18.612 --> 34:22.449
Feel like I been humped
by a 300-pound whore.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.828
Well, Gus, I'd say
you got off easy.

34:25.911 --> 34:27.871
Look at my face.

34:30.208 --> 34:33.795
Well, you can bet Butler will
square things with that big man

34:33.837 --> 34:36.630
for breaking his arm and all.

34:36.715 --> 34:38.967
Did you hear it snap?

34:40.301 --> 34:41.928
I heard it snap.

34:42.012 --> 34:44.304
Lucky for him he shoots
with either hand.

34:46.306 --> 34:48.976
One twitch, and you're in hell!

34:49.018 --> 34:51.647
Now, get on your feet,
all of you!

34:53.858 --> 34:56.484
Now, throw them guns
on the ground.

35:01.072 --> 35:03.117
I ain't a-gonna say it again.

35:08.622 --> 35:10.791
And kick them away.

35:19.008 --> 35:21.594
Which one of you's got
a sore back?

35:23.220 --> 35:24.972
Which one?

35:25.057 --> 35:27.016
Him.

35:27.934 --> 35:30.103
- You're Gus?
- Yeah.

35:30.186 --> 35:32.188
Ought not gang up on a man
three-to-one.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.189
Ohh!

35:33.231 --> 35:34.858
Wait a minute, mister.

35:34.941 --> 35:37.694
- It wasn't our idea to jump him.
- Shut up, Wylie.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.779
Get up, you son of a bitch.

35:39.863 --> 35:43.116
- What's your name?
- Vince.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.745
Mighty nice tie-down you got.
You're a gunhand, are you?

35:46.827 --> 35:48.455
- You fast?
- No.

35:48.537 --> 35:50.040
Uh-huh.

35:50.082 --> 35:53.251
How many riders does he have?

35:53.335 --> 35:56.254
I said, how many riders?

35:56.338 --> 35:59.173
The rest are on their way
to your wagon.

36:01.635 --> 36:04.262
Uhh! Aah!

36:04.347 --> 36:06.973
You want to smile now, go ahead.

36:07.057 --> 36:09.102
Be a while before he's of use.

36:09.184 --> 36:12.814
Charley, throw me
them saddlebags.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.072
Put your spook hats on.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.535
The ones in your belt,
put them on.

36:29.996 --> 36:32.750
Now get your britches off.

36:33.835 --> 36:37.005
Not taking my britches off
for nobody.

36:39.924 --> 36:41.926
You listen out
of your good ear now.

36:42.010 --> 36:43.469
Now, get them off!

36:50.309 --> 36:52.562
Pretty scary bunch, eh, Charley?

36:55.983 --> 36:58.776
Get belly-down, flat-out!

36:58.818 --> 37:00.361
Uhh!

37:00.446 --> 37:02.448
Get your peckers in the dirt.

37:02.488 --> 37:04.742
- Hyah! Hah!

37:04.824 --> 37:05.992
Hah!

37:07.077 --> 37:10.538
If I hear so much
as a twig break...

37:10.622 --> 37:13.542
I'll come back
and kill you all.

37:18.088 --> 37:20.048
Charley.

37:20.132 --> 37:21.800
Charley!

37:55.043 --> 37:57.212
No Tig come to meet us.

38:13.396 --> 38:17.524
Ooh.
The bastards.

38:17.607 --> 38:21.361
They shot the boy,
but he's alive.

38:22.278 --> 38:24.239
Is that Mose?

38:30.204 --> 38:31.705
He's dead.

38:32.706 --> 38:34.834
Shot him in the head.

38:41.339 --> 38:42.591
Charley?

38:47.804 --> 38:49.265
Charley?

38:52.184 --> 38:55.604
Charley, get the lantern
and the whiskey.

39:01.986 --> 39:04.071
Yeah.

39:05.531 --> 39:06.742
Come on, wake up.

39:06.824 --> 39:08.076
Charley.

39:09.077 --> 39:13.581
They shot him here and
cracked him in the head here.

39:13.665 --> 39:15.917
We'll have to dig
that bullet out.

39:22.090 --> 39:24.009
You done good, Boss.

39:27.596 --> 39:30.557
Him going in and out like that.

39:30.640 --> 39:34.144
I don't know.
He lost a lot of blood.

39:34.227 --> 39:36.938
A whack on the head
can make a man strange

39:37.022 --> 39:39.900
for the rest of his days.

39:39.983 --> 39:42.861
Well, you done all you can.

39:42.944 --> 39:45.530
He needs a doctor now.

39:46.491 --> 39:48.785
If Button lives through morning,

39:48.825 --> 39:51.161
you take him in the wagon
and move on.

39:53.288 --> 39:56.250
You just gonna sit out here
waiting with them cows?

39:56.333 --> 39:58.127
That's right.

39:59.461 --> 40:01.964
And I'm gonna kill
every son of a bitch

40:02.006 --> 40:04.341
that comes to take them.

40:05.843 --> 40:07.261
For one man on open ground,

40:07.345 --> 40:09.889
you sure got a lot
of killing in mind.

40:23.111 --> 40:26.031
You know I never
gone against you, Boss.

40:26.114 --> 40:29.952
Always let you do
most of the talking.

40:30.034 --> 40:32.371
But he needs that doctor
back in that town,

40:32.453 --> 40:34.914
and I aim to take him.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.999
If you want to come,
we'll go together.

40:37.041 --> 40:42.172
Otherwise, you do what you
have to do, I'll do the same.

40:42.256 --> 40:45.259
You think they'll let you waltz
in there and waltz out?

40:45.342 --> 40:46.719
I don't figure into it.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.471
Button deserves every chance
we can give him.

40:53.850 --> 40:55.310
All right.

40:59.733 --> 41:02.693
But I aim to kill Baxter
and those that done this.

41:02.735 --> 41:05.779
And if that marshal gets in the
way, I'm gonna kill him, too.

41:05.863 --> 41:09.533
So you best get your mind right
about what's got to be done.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.704
I got no problem
with killing, Boss.

41:13.788 --> 41:15.289
Never have.

42:15.518 --> 42:17.727
Looks real nice, Charley.

42:19.020 --> 42:22.191
Yeah, a man ought to have
something to show he was here.

42:23.818 --> 42:26.570
Be gone in another big storm.

42:26.654 --> 42:29.198
Don't matter none.
He's got your dog for company.

42:29.281 --> 42:33.035
He'd like it you put
old Tig with him.

42:33.119 --> 42:35.454
Yeah, he was more
Mose's dog in the end

42:35.496 --> 42:37.498
than he was mine.

42:39.166 --> 42:42.628
Be right to say some words.

42:42.713 --> 42:45.298
You want to speak
with the man upstairs, do it.

42:45.339 --> 42:47.467
I'll stand right here
and listen,

42:47.508 --> 42:50.303
but I ain't talking
to that son of a bitch.

42:50.345 --> 42:51.763
And I'll be holding a grudge

42:51.846 --> 42:56.851
for him letting this befall
a sweet kid like Mose.

43:02.733 --> 43:05.819
Well, he sure as hell
wasn't one to complain.

43:07.195 --> 43:09.322
Woke with a smile.

43:09.365 --> 43:11.992
Seemed like he could keep it
there all day.

43:13.452 --> 43:15.871
Kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it,

43:15.912 --> 43:17.873
whether it was or not.

43:19.166 --> 43:22.669
To tell you the truth, Lord,
if there was two gentler souls,

43:22.712 --> 43:24.504
I never seen them.

43:25.672 --> 43:29.177
Seemed like old Tig wouldn't
even kill birds in the end.

43:30.887 --> 43:33.722
Well, you got yourself
a good man and a good dog,

43:33.765 --> 43:35.391
and I'm inclined to agree
with Boss

43:35.475 --> 43:37.894
about holding a grudge
against you for it.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.522
I guess that means "amen. "

44:05.047 --> 44:06.964
God.

44:07.049 --> 44:08.966
Charley, you all right?

44:14.515 --> 44:16.058
I'm fine.

44:17.267 --> 44:19.103
Seems like you was, you know...

44:19.185 --> 44:21.063
I said I'm fine.

44:23.107 --> 44:25.984
Just got some old feelings
coming up.

44:27.403 --> 44:29.988
You know, we never asked
each other much.

44:30.072 --> 44:33.951
That's always been okay with me.
I figured it was okay with you.

44:33.992 --> 44:37.162
But you said some things
the last couple of days.

44:37.246 --> 44:42.251
Things that seemed like they had
kind of a history to them.

44:45.588 --> 44:46.505
Hey, Charley?

44:46.589 --> 44:49.007
Don't stand behind me, Boss.

45:12.991 --> 45:16.745
When I was a kid, a bunch of us
would go into the woods

45:16.828 --> 45:18.788
with our peashooters.

45:18.830 --> 45:22.542
Nothing fancy, just enough
to kill a bird or a squirrel,

45:22.625 --> 45:25.628
maybe something larger
if we was lucky.

45:27.297 --> 45:30.468
Killed my first man
in them woods.

45:30.550 --> 45:35.056
Held the paper on our farm,
and after my pa died,

45:35.138 --> 45:38.976
he'd come around to get payment
from my mom in any way he could.

45:40.102 --> 45:44.064
Weren't much older than Button
when I shot him in the throat.

45:45.524 --> 45:49.695
Knew there'd be more killing, so
I run off and joined the Army.

45:49.779 --> 45:52.238
War was on.

45:52.323 --> 45:54.824
They was only too happy
to have me.

45:56.577 --> 45:59.663
My first skirmish was like
hunting with my friends.

45:59.705 --> 46:04.001
We just sat up in some trees,
and they came marching at us.

46:05.044 --> 46:09.965
Must have been a hundred of them
dead after the smoke cleared.

46:10.050 --> 46:12.676
Went around and shot the rest
who weren't.

46:14.136 --> 46:17.391
Those of us with the knack
was made into a special squad

46:17.473 --> 46:19.935
so we could travel light
and on our own

46:20.017 --> 46:22.061
into enemy territory.

46:23.062 --> 46:27.775
Orders were pretty simple.
Make trouble wherever we could.

46:27.859 --> 46:31.946
With room like that, it wasn't
long before we was killing men

46:32.030 --> 46:34.366
that weren't even in uniform.

46:35.408 --> 46:38.412
Seemed like that went on
the rest of the war.

46:39.871 --> 46:42.499
After that, I come West.

46:43.458 --> 46:47.129
Lot of call for a man
with them skills.

46:47.212 --> 46:50.716
And I put them to work
for men just like Baxter.

46:55.762 --> 46:58.808
Every once in a while,
I almost get through a day

46:58.890 --> 47:03.521
without thinking
about who I am, what I'd done.

47:13.281 --> 47:15.324
He drifted off again.

47:15.407 --> 47:18.953
No better, but no worse, either.

47:19.037 --> 47:22.040
You're a real honest man,
Charley.

47:22.123 --> 47:24.167
Well, I ain't gonna lie
about Button.

47:24.250 --> 47:26.711
Not Button I'm talking about.

47:54.031 --> 47:56.075
- Mr. Spearman.
- The doctor in?

47:56.158 --> 47:57.618
No, he's not here.

47:57.700 --> 48:00.162
We got a boy that's hurt bad.

48:00.245 --> 48:03.164
Here, put him
in the examining room.

48:19.348 --> 48:20.975
It's not his hearing, ma'am.

48:21.016 --> 48:23.018
He hears real well
when he's awake.

48:23.060 --> 48:26.230
Mr. Spearman, I'm checking
if there's blood in his ears.

48:26.314 --> 48:28.816
It could mean a fractured skull.

48:32.153 --> 48:33.987
Are you the boy's father?

48:34.072 --> 48:35.365
No, ma'am.

48:35.448 --> 48:38.034
His name's Button,
and he works for me.

48:38.118 --> 48:42.038
It appears that's
not very healthy.

48:42.080 --> 48:46.000
You know the way to the parlor.
Sit down.

48:46.041 --> 48:47.669
I'll be a while.

49:09.900 --> 49:12.694
Well, I don't think
it's a fracture.

49:12.737 --> 49:16.073
Concussion's more likely,
but it's bad.

49:26.292 --> 49:29.462
I have to admit, we don't see
a lot of people shot.

49:29.545 --> 49:33.090
I cleaned and dressed the wound.
Doesn't look infected.

49:33.174 --> 49:34.801
What about the fever?

49:34.884 --> 49:38.888
He needs to lay still
and let his body do its work.

49:38.972 --> 49:41.515
No offense, ma'am,
but we come a long way

49:41.599 --> 49:45.811
to see that the boy gets looked
after proper by Dr. Barlow.

49:45.895 --> 49:47.147
Now, where's he at?

49:47.229 --> 49:48.732
One of Dent Baxter's hands

49:48.814 --> 49:50.816
came and fetched him
out to the ranch.

49:50.901 --> 49:54.363
Some men there had an accident
night before last.

49:59.242 --> 50:02.412
You must tell me what happened,
Mr. Spearman.

50:03.746 --> 50:05.791
Baxter sent his men
to stampede the herd,

50:05.874 --> 50:08.710
and I figured me and Charley
to stop them.

50:08.794 --> 50:12.005
Surprised them where they was
hiding, and we had at them.

50:12.089 --> 50:15.967
Them's the one Dr. Barlow's
putting back together.

50:16.051 --> 50:20.305
We got back to camp, others
had shot Mose in the head,

50:20.389 --> 50:22.516
shot Button, left him for dead.

50:22.599 --> 50:23.559
Oh.

50:26.937 --> 50:28.980
Shot our dog.

50:31.983 --> 50:33.486
I'll be getting money.

50:33.568 --> 50:36.154
It's not necessary.

50:36.239 --> 50:38.241
We pay our way, ma'am.

50:43.788 --> 50:46.666
Please, sit, Mr. Waite.

50:50.128 --> 50:53.005
Button.
Is that his real name?

50:53.840 --> 50:56.342
Please, sit.

50:58.052 --> 51:01.764
Yeah, it's the only one
we've known.

51:03.891 --> 51:06.145
He's just a boy.

51:07.146 --> 51:08.855
Yeah.

51:08.938 --> 51:11.775
Picked him up in a Texas town
a few years back,

51:11.858 --> 51:14.319
living off cafÃ© garbage.

51:14.361 --> 51:16.863
Couldn't speak a word
of English.

51:16.905 --> 51:19.699
Thought we was doing him
a favor.

51:19.783 --> 51:22.326
What about you?

51:23.120 --> 51:24.162
Hmm?

51:24.203 --> 51:26.497
You know that the marshal
works for Baxter.

51:26.582 --> 51:29.084
People saw you ride in.

51:31.045 --> 51:33.047
There's payment to be made
by them that done this.

51:33.130 --> 51:35.841
Don't intend to run.

51:38.719 --> 51:41.722
We could wire
for the federal marshal.

51:43.891 --> 51:47.436
If he started riding today,
he wouldn't make it for a week.

51:47.519 --> 51:50.522
With the storm coming,
maybe longer.

51:51.982 --> 51:55.904
We're obliged to deal with the
marshal and Baxter ourselves.

51:55.945 --> 51:57.988
What about Button?

52:00.241 --> 52:03.119
Well, he's fighting
for his life.

52:03.202 --> 52:04.453
We're gonna do the same.

52:11.127 --> 52:15.799
Whatever's needed for Button,
you do it.

52:15.882 --> 52:18.593
If he wakes, he's gonna need
to stay here a couple days

52:18.676 --> 52:21.137
so we can watch him.

52:21.221 --> 52:23.640
Whatever's best for him.

52:36.070 --> 52:39.490
Can't stay away from
my little paradise, gents?!

52:39.572 --> 52:42.784
Believe Satan says the same at
the gates of hell, old-timer!

52:44.911 --> 52:48.290
We'd like to put the horses up.
Had a tough trail.

52:48.373 --> 52:50.042
I'd like to set
the wagon yonder.

52:50.126 --> 52:52.712
Help yourself!
Hurry up, though!

52:52.794 --> 52:55.380
I seen it like this before!

52:55.464 --> 52:57.508
Big one's coming!

52:57.591 --> 52:59.885
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

54:03.742 --> 54:05.786
Son of a bitch.

54:13.377 --> 54:15.338
Sorry, Charley.

54:18.716 --> 54:19.926
Yeah.

54:35.566 --> 54:37.820
Jesus Christ.

54:41.989 --> 54:44.867
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

54:49.164 --> 54:52.542
Maybe you should have built it
in another spot.

54:53.335 --> 54:55.879
Ah, mercy.

55:13.272 --> 55:15.774
Get the dog!

55:15.816 --> 55:17.776
Get the dog!

55:19.611 --> 55:20.904
Get the dog!

55:22.407 --> 55:25.200
It's a dog there, Charley.

55:35.085 --> 55:36.755
Take this.

55:39.131 --> 55:41.176
There he is.
Back here, Charley!

55:42.260 --> 55:43.594
To your left!
To your left!

55:43.636 --> 55:45.263
Get him!
Get him!

55:52.812 --> 55:54.439
You all right, Charley?

55:54.481 --> 55:58.360
Yeah, considering
I've just been swimming.

56:03.490 --> 56:05.450
I owe you, mister.

56:06.326 --> 56:08.287
That's a sweet pup
you got there.

56:08.328 --> 56:11.332
Remind you of anyone, Charley?

56:11.414 --> 56:13.249
Small version.

56:13.334 --> 56:15.126
Too small to be let out
in this weather.

56:15.211 --> 56:17.088
Belongs to my daughter.

56:17.171 --> 56:20.758
I tried to grab him, but
the water was too fast for me.

56:21.384 --> 56:23.636
If you're going into the cafÃ©,

56:23.718 --> 56:26.722
I'd be proud to buy you both
a cup of coffee.

56:30.058 --> 56:32.520
Coffee would be good about now.

56:38.359 --> 56:40.653
This is like the storm
that washed away Gunnison

56:40.736 --> 56:42.530
10, 12 years back.

56:42.613 --> 56:45.533
The water come down
from the mountains.

56:45.575 --> 56:48.286
Nowhere to go
but straight into town.

56:48.369 --> 56:50.496
- Killed a lot of folks.
- It's okay, Bill.

56:50.538 --> 56:53.207
Town's been here
a long time, Mack.

56:53.290 --> 56:54.918
It'll be here a lot longer.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.503
That's right, Papa.

56:56.585 --> 56:59.047
Every once in a while,
a good storm washes through

56:59.089 --> 57:03.343
and leaves her as clean
as a baby's bottom.

57:03.385 --> 57:05.929
Got to look
on the bright side, gents.

57:17.566 --> 57:19.776
Marshal.

57:19.860 --> 57:22.697
Meat and spuds, Les, as always.

57:25.365 --> 57:27.367
That should cover our meal.

57:28.745 --> 57:31.873
Worth a man's life to walk
across that road tonight.

57:31.955 --> 57:33.458
Thanks for the coffee.

57:33.540 --> 57:35.959
Well, appreciate what you done.

57:37.920 --> 57:40.839
That'll be two bits.

57:40.923 --> 57:42.383
Two bits.

58:03.863 --> 58:06.783
I'll be having words
with you two.

58:06.824 --> 58:10.370
And we'll be having more
than that with you, Marshal.

58:21.632 --> 58:25.386
No need to make
the cafÃ© messy... with folks.

58:25.468 --> 58:27.762
I've got a warrant sworn out
for your arrest

58:27.846 --> 58:29.556
for assaulting Baxter's men.

58:29.639 --> 58:31.766
We got a warrant sworn
for attempted murder

58:31.809 --> 58:33.310
for them that tried
to kill the boy

58:33.394 --> 58:35.687
who's laying over there
at the doc's.

58:35.771 --> 58:36.730
Swore out another one

58:36.813 --> 58:40.025
for them that murdered the big
fellow you had in your cell.

58:40.108 --> 58:41.860
Only ours ain't writ
by no tin star

58:41.944 --> 58:43.696
bought and paid for, Marshal.

58:43.779 --> 58:47.449
It's writ by us.
And we aim to enforce it.

58:47.533 --> 58:49.201
Is that so?

58:49.284 --> 58:52.496
We got no quarrel
with none of you folks.

58:52.579 --> 58:56.125
Baxter's men bushwhacked
our friend and shot him dead.

58:56.166 --> 58:58.378
Shot a 16-year-old boy, too.

58:58.460 --> 59:00.964
And clubbed him so hard...

59:02.507 --> 59:05.008
He might not live.

59:05.093 --> 59:07.846
Tried to take our cattle.

59:07.928 --> 59:11.141
Your marshal here ain't gonna do
nothing about it.

59:12.641 --> 59:15.770
You don't like free grazers
in this town.

59:15.854 --> 59:17.396
We don't much like being here.

59:17.480 --> 59:19.733
But a man's got a right
to protect his property

59:19.815 --> 59:21.317
and his life.

59:21.400 --> 59:26.197
And we ain't letting no rancher
or his lawman take either.

59:27.532 --> 59:30.243
We got no intention
of harming bystanders.

59:30.326 --> 59:31.953
Anyone who helps or comforts

59:32.038 --> 59:35.123
these goddamn lawbreaking
free grazers

59:35.207 --> 59:37.876
is gonna have to deal with me.

59:50.890 --> 59:52.850
Your call, Marshal.

59:57.395 --> 01:00:01.025
We don't have to settle this
here and now.

01:00:01.107 --> 01:00:04.111
You ain't going nowhere
in this weather.

01:00:04.195 --> 01:00:06.655
But I'll be seeing you gents
real soon.

01:00:06.739 --> 01:00:08.783
You can count on that.

01:00:21.629 --> 01:00:24.091
That marshal ain't gonna wait.

01:00:24.173 --> 01:00:27.427
That son of a bitch is gonna get
some men, come looking for us.

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:29.804
He's gonna need us locked up
tight in that jail

01:00:29.887 --> 01:00:32.265
by the time Baxter hits town,
'cause if we ain't,

01:00:32.307 --> 01:00:33.766
Baxter's gonna start to think

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:37.395
that maybe Marshal Poole ain't
worth what he's paying him.

01:00:37.479 --> 01:00:41.024
You got something on your mind,
just spit it out.

01:00:41.107 --> 01:00:43.819
Well, I say we take him
right at the jail.

01:00:43.902 --> 01:00:46.738
Lock him up, wait for Baxter
to come riding in.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.574
Hell, Charley, why don't we
just ride out to Baxter's ranch

01:00:49.616 --> 01:00:52.202
and go straight at him, too?

01:00:53.619 --> 01:00:55.414
Well, I'll fight
wherever you want, Boss.

01:00:55.455 --> 01:00:56.623
You just make the call.

01:00:56.707 --> 01:00:58.291
God damn it.

01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:00.168
Now, hold on, Charley.
Hold on.

01:01:00.252 --> 01:01:03.089
Well, you asked me.
I told you.

01:01:08.176 --> 01:01:10.929
Charley, come on in
out of the rain, would you?

01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:12.639
Come on.

01:01:16.769 --> 01:01:18.228
Come on.

01:01:23.484 --> 01:01:25.152
Just getting testy
in my old age.

01:01:25.236 --> 01:01:26.862
Sounds like it's not
such a bad idea.

01:01:26.946 --> 01:01:29.031
Just roll it around
is all I ask.

01:01:29.115 --> 01:01:30.825
All right.

01:01:32.368 --> 01:01:34.787
What'd you think of my speech
in there?

01:01:37.665 --> 01:01:39.793
Liked it.

01:01:39.876 --> 01:01:42.963
Maybe I ought to run
for mayor.

01:01:43.046 --> 01:01:45.381
Well, I believe officeholders
got to be living, Boss.

01:01:54.308 --> 01:01:56.267
Come to see about the boy.

01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.979
He's asleep.
But, please, come in.

01:02:00.022 --> 01:02:02.565
Are you sure, ma'am?
We're a mite rank.

01:02:02.649 --> 01:02:04.150
We don't want to mess
your house.

01:02:04.234 --> 01:02:05.944
No, no.
No, please, it's all right.

01:02:06.027 --> 01:02:07.654
Come on in.

01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:43.483
Thank you, ma'am.

01:02:45.235 --> 01:02:47.027
There you are.

01:03:01.084 --> 01:03:04.087
I can't get my fingers in.

01:03:08.091 --> 01:03:10.302
We can't get our big fat fingers
in these holes.

01:03:10.385 --> 01:03:12.722
- Too many broke knuckles.

01:03:12.804 --> 01:03:14.514
Oh, let me get you
something bigger.

01:03:14.598 --> 01:03:17.893
- No, ma'am, we can make do.
- No, no. It's all right.

01:03:17.934 --> 01:03:22.731
It's just nice to be sitting
at a table set with fine china.

01:03:22.815 --> 01:03:25.567
Those were my mother's.

01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:27.026
They were the only things
of hers

01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:29.738
that survived the trip
out here.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.699
I don't know why
I bring them out.

01:03:31.781 --> 01:03:34.325
I can't hold them, either.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.871
Guess it just makes me
feel good.

01:03:36.954 --> 01:03:39.498
I say what's
on my mind, good or bad.

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:40.916
I admire that.

01:03:40.957 --> 01:03:43.461
Try living with it.

01:03:43.502 --> 01:03:45.755
See that?

01:03:45.796 --> 01:03:47.298
No need for a wife or home.

01:03:47.381 --> 01:03:50.092
We're just like a...
an old married couple.

01:03:51.677 --> 01:03:53.889
So, is it marriage
that scares you two

01:03:53.971 --> 01:03:56.098
- or putting down roots?
- No. Who'd have him?

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.727
All rangy and mangy
like a rough old dog.

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:01.437
How about I hold
your head underwater

01:04:01.521 --> 01:04:03.689
for just a little while?

01:04:14.075 --> 01:04:16.077
I married once.

01:04:17.704 --> 01:04:19.955
Never knowed that,
did you, Charley?

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.459
Had a wife and child.

01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:23.835
Sweet little spread, too.

01:04:23.919 --> 01:04:28.340
It was nothing fancy,
but we was young.

01:04:28.424 --> 01:04:30.967
Loved each other.

01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:33.304
Never had a cross word.

01:04:34.513 --> 01:04:36.056
They caught the typhus
and died.

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:40.310
And after that, home didn't seem
a place to spend time.

01:04:40.394 --> 01:04:42.355
Believe I've changed
my mind on that

01:04:42.396 --> 01:04:45.440
now that I'm getting on
in years.

01:04:50.696 --> 01:04:55.118
If Button lives
and we survive Baxter,

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.913
I swear I aim to see to it
there's a home he's sleeping in

01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:01.665
instead of the cold prairie.

01:05:09.799 --> 01:05:11.718
Have yourself a last cup
of tea, Charley.

01:05:11.759 --> 01:05:13.761
I'd like to see Button again,
Miss Barlow.

01:05:13.845 --> 01:05:14.804
Of course.

01:05:14.888 --> 01:05:16.431
I know the way.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.353
Whew.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.283
Been riding with him 10 years.

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:36.659
Never said nothing
about being married.

01:05:45.461 --> 01:05:47.712
Where are you and Mr. Spearman
spending the night?

01:05:47.796 --> 01:05:48.797
Don't rightly know.

01:05:48.881 --> 01:05:53.343
It... depends on circumstances.

01:05:53.427 --> 01:05:55.804
You mean Marshal Poole?

01:05:55.888 --> 01:05:58.349
We have a spare room.
It's yours if you want it.

01:05:58.432 --> 01:05:59.433
Couldn't do that, ma'am.

01:05:59.516 --> 01:06:02.436
We'd be putting you in a spot
with the marshal and Baxter.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.648
Besides, it's a small town.

01:06:05.731 --> 01:06:09.402
Wouldn't look right,
particularly with the doc away.

01:06:28.338 --> 01:06:30.340
I'll take those.

01:06:31.298 --> 01:06:33.134
You know where they go?

01:06:33.218 --> 01:06:34.302
I saw.

01:06:34.386 --> 01:06:36.096
Thank you.

01:06:37.972 --> 01:06:41.017
Been raining like hell
ever since we got here.

01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:44.604
Water washing right down
Main Street.

01:06:44.687 --> 01:06:47.273
Charley saved a pup
from being washed away.

01:06:47.357 --> 01:06:49.609
Looked a little like old Tig.

01:06:54.197 --> 01:06:57.367
Now, if you can, you got to
listen and pay attention.

01:06:58.827 --> 01:07:02.414
'Cause I got something
important to say.

01:07:02.498 --> 01:07:07.169
I ain't been looking after you
for you to go out this way.

01:07:07.253 --> 01:07:09.714
The world ain't
a perfect place, Button.

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:12.633
But you got
unfinished business here.

01:07:14.009 --> 01:07:16.929
So you come back,
you hear me, now?

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.807
You come back.

01:07:27.107 --> 01:07:28.984
Kind of dumb talking to him
like that.

01:07:29.024 --> 01:07:30.067
No.

01:07:30.151 --> 01:07:32.111
No, it's good.

01:07:33.946 --> 01:07:35.656
You all right, Mr. Spearman?

01:07:35.741 --> 01:07:39.076
Believe I'm as right as a man
can be under the circumstances.

01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:42.497
Circumstances? That's just what
Mr. Waite called them.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:46.460
I asked him to reconsider,
and I'm asking you.

01:07:46.543 --> 01:07:49.671
By "reconsider,"
you mean tuck tail and run?

01:07:49.755 --> 01:07:52.716
I mean save your life and his.

01:07:52.757 --> 01:07:55.010
He'll listen to you.

01:07:55.051 --> 01:07:57.429
Charley thinks for hisself,
Miss Barlow.

01:07:57.512 --> 01:08:00.682
He's a good man, and he knows
what has to be done.

01:08:02.059 --> 01:08:04.686
I'll be paying you now
for whatever else Button needs.

01:08:04.728 --> 01:08:06.480
In case it goes bad
for Charley and me,

01:08:06.563 --> 01:08:10.609
maybe you and the doc will see
we're taken care of properly.

01:08:11.193 --> 01:08:14.280
I'd like to put pen to paper
if you have them.

01:08:14.362 --> 01:08:16.823
Yes. Of course.

01:09:11.505 --> 01:09:13.631
Mr. Waite?

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.633
Look at my face.

01:09:16.844 --> 01:09:19.011
- Oh! Sorry!

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:23.267
I'm sorry.

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.894
It's all right, Charley.

01:09:25.978 --> 01:09:28.104
Okay?
It just be us.

01:09:31.442 --> 01:09:33.277
It's all right, Charley.

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:44.955
It's all right, Charley.

01:09:50.877 --> 01:09:53.298
It's all right.
I'll get it.

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:20.116
Jumpy is all.

01:10:34.715 --> 01:10:36.842
She ought not to sneak up
like that.

01:10:36.925 --> 01:10:38.886
She weren't sneaking.

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:41.680
I scared that woman
half to death.

01:10:41.722 --> 01:10:43.807
Yeah.
Scared me a little bit, too.

01:10:45.476 --> 01:10:47.603
Well, that's how it is, Boss.

01:10:47.685 --> 01:10:50.064
Ain't a pretty picture.

01:10:50.147 --> 01:10:52.358
Got your wits about you now?

01:10:53.526 --> 01:10:54.568
Yeah.

01:10:54.652 --> 01:10:55.569
Yeah.

01:10:55.653 --> 01:10:58.114
It weren't as bad as it looked.

01:10:58.197 --> 01:11:00.033
I'll bet.

01:11:11.128 --> 01:11:13.714
Go! Hyah!

01:11:39.197 --> 01:11:41.408
Two whiskeys, barkeep.

01:11:48.958 --> 01:11:52.253
Barkeep!
Two whiskeys.

01:11:55.464 --> 01:11:57.592
You see that sign?

01:11:57.632 --> 01:12:01.262
Around these parts,
free grazers is the first.

01:12:18.654 --> 01:12:21.365
Now, he asked you twice.

01:12:21.449 --> 01:12:23.618
Ain't gonna ask again.

01:12:26.162 --> 01:12:29.207
Hey, Bill, it's all right.

01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:31.292
These are the fellows
that saved my dog.

01:12:31.376 --> 01:12:34.629
I couldn't serve them
if they saved Jesus himself.

01:12:34.671 --> 01:12:36.590
Mr. Baxter would have my job.

01:12:36.672 --> 01:12:37.632
Baxter the owner?

01:12:37.716 --> 01:12:39.050
That's right.

01:12:39.134 --> 01:12:40.968
Give me a bottle.
I'll serve them myself.

01:12:41.011 --> 01:12:42.512
You know I can't do that.

01:12:54.191 --> 01:12:56.485
Now we'll have our drinks.

01:13:12.584 --> 01:13:14.546
Believe I'll have me another.

01:13:16.881 --> 01:13:18.966
Yes.

01:13:24.513 --> 01:13:28.434
Well, looks like the rain's
let up a bit.

01:13:28.518 --> 01:13:29.352
Well, if it don't,

01:13:29.435 --> 01:13:31.938
there'll be trout fishing
right on Main Street.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.609
I'd like you to meet my boys.

01:13:37.694 --> 01:13:39.194
Ray and Cory.

01:13:40.258 --> 01:13:42.635
We run a freight outfit
when the weather cooperates.

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:43.762
Boss Spearman.

01:13:43.845 --> 01:13:47.474
And the marksman here
is Charley Waite.

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:51.102
Is all that true,
what you said in the cafÃ©?

01:13:51.185 --> 01:13:52.353
Yeah.

01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:55.146
There's a kid at the doc's house

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:57.566
put on death's doorstep
by Baxter.

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:58.859
Doc's wife's caring for him

01:13:58.943 --> 01:14:00.861
until he comes back
after the storm.

01:14:00.944 --> 01:14:02.070
Doc's wife?

01:14:02.154 --> 01:14:03.863
Yeah.
Miss Barlow.

01:14:03.947 --> 01:14:05.323
You mean Sue?

01:14:05.406 --> 01:14:06.784
That's right.

01:14:06.866 --> 01:14:09.243
Well, she'd make somebody
a fine wife.

01:14:09.285 --> 01:14:12.579
But she ain't the doc's.

01:14:12.664 --> 01:14:14.456
That's his sister.

01:14:14.541 --> 01:14:15.874
His sister?

01:14:15.959 --> 01:14:18.585
Ain't his wife.

01:14:21.505 --> 01:14:23.257
Good evening, Mack.

01:14:23.339 --> 01:14:24.258
Ralph.

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:25.384
Ray, Cory.

01:14:25.467 --> 01:14:27.260
Whiskey.

01:14:27.302 --> 01:14:29.512
This is Ralph Peterson.
He runs the general store.

01:14:29.596 --> 01:14:32.098
That's where I was
when the dog got free.

01:14:32.181 --> 01:14:35.143
You fellers the free grazers,
I expect.

01:14:42.984 --> 01:14:44.152
No offense.

01:14:44.234 --> 01:14:46.320
Personally, I don't stand
with others around here

01:14:46.403 --> 01:14:48.280
about free grazers.

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:52.909
There was a fight in your store
about a week or so back.

01:14:52.992 --> 01:14:55.328
Some of Baxter's men
jumped our friend.

01:14:55.411 --> 01:14:56.371
He was a big feller.

01:14:56.453 --> 01:14:58.289
Yeah.
I saw the whole thing.

01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:00.709
That big feller drubbed the hell
out of them other three.

01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:03.169
Broke one's arm.

01:15:03.252 --> 01:15:05.671
Be a gunhand named Butler,
would it?

01:15:05.753 --> 01:15:07.715
That's what they say.

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:11.886
Felt bad about your friend.
Is he all right?

01:15:13.595 --> 01:15:15.263
He's dead.

01:15:18.725 --> 01:15:20.059
That's too bad.

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:21.644
Seemed like
a nice young feller.

01:15:21.727 --> 01:15:24.981
It's a shame what this town
has come to.

01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:27.566
You could do something
about it.

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:31.777
What?

01:15:31.862 --> 01:15:33.113
We're freighters.

01:15:33.155 --> 01:15:36.158
Ralph here's a shopkeeper.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.785
You're men, ain't you?

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:43.498
I didn't raise my boys
just to see them killed.

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:45.999
Well, you may not know this,

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:51.005
but there's things that gnaw
on a man worse than dying.

01:16:15.277 --> 01:16:16.320
Hey!

01:16:19.364 --> 01:16:20.698
Evening, gents.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.200
Evening.

01:16:22.283 --> 01:16:23.576
Better get out of this weather,

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.870
or your bones are gonna be
even stiffer than mine.

01:16:25.954 --> 01:16:28.498
Heading into the saloon
to do just that.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:29.958
Come looking for you boys.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.167
I'd have bought you a drink
if you was earlier.

01:16:32.252 --> 01:16:34.587
Then turn around
and do it now.

01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:38.339
Marshal's got men waiting to
waylay you back at the livery.

01:16:38.382 --> 01:16:39.799
Another one's in your wagon.

01:16:39.883 --> 01:16:42.636
And then there's another
in the shed across from it.

01:16:42.719 --> 01:16:43.678
Marshal with them?

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.180
No.

01:16:45.222 --> 01:16:47.348
He's sitting up there
all by his lonesome

01:16:47.391 --> 01:16:49.600
in that warm, dry jailhouse
with his feet up

01:16:49.685 --> 01:16:51.811
waiting for them
to bring you in.

01:16:51.894 --> 01:16:53.728
Or kill you.

01:16:53.771 --> 01:16:55.356
Well, thanks for the warning.

01:16:55.439 --> 01:16:59.693
Like I told you, never been
partial to the marshal's ways.

01:16:59.735 --> 01:17:01.570
Dent Baxter's either.

01:17:01.653 --> 01:17:04.197
You're near the only friend
we got in this town.

01:17:04.239 --> 01:17:06.532
I'll be buying a drink or two.

01:17:06.575 --> 01:17:09.410
You keep it quiet, all right?

01:17:13.497 --> 01:17:15.833
Time's come.
How you want to play it?

01:17:15.916 --> 01:17:18.752
Well, I work for you, Boss.
I'll play it however you want.

01:17:18.836 --> 01:17:21.337
Nobody works for anybody here,
Charley.

01:17:22.131 --> 01:17:24.717
Now, the name Butler mean
anything to you?

01:17:24.758 --> 01:17:27.260
You hear names when you're on
the other side of things.

01:17:27.302 --> 01:17:29.762
He as fast as they say?

01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:30.972
He's a killer.

01:17:31.055 --> 01:17:32.724
Know him if you saw him?

01:17:32.765 --> 01:17:34.100
He ain't hard to recognize

01:17:34.141 --> 01:17:36.102
if you know
what you're looking for.

01:17:36.143 --> 01:17:37.603
Yeah.

01:17:37.645 --> 01:17:39.313
Too bad if we get
shot up tonight

01:17:39.397 --> 01:17:41.356
before we get a chance
at him and Baxter.

01:17:41.441 --> 01:17:43.318
Sure as hell is.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.277
Tell you what,
I'd like to sit someplace dry

01:17:45.319 --> 01:17:48.362
while the marshal's men
sit out in this rain.

01:17:48.447 --> 01:17:51.074
Won't be so steady
come morning.

01:17:51.115 --> 01:17:51.909
Small town.

01:17:51.949 --> 01:17:56.246
It's hard to hide even at night
in this weather.

01:17:56.287 --> 01:17:58.707
What do you want to do?

01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:00.041
Yep.

01:18:00.124 --> 01:18:02.876
Heard me an idea
sounded pretty good.

01:18:04.003 --> 01:18:05.962
You did, did you?

01:18:08.883 --> 01:18:10.717
Well, all right.

01:18:25.815 --> 01:18:27.066
He's alone.

01:18:28.483 --> 01:18:30.194
Get your hands up.

01:18:30.277 --> 01:18:32.279
You must be plumb crazy.

01:18:32.362 --> 01:18:33.863
Shut up.

01:18:46.668 --> 01:18:48.752
You're dead men.

01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.048
Didn't he tell you to shut up?

01:18:57.344 --> 01:18:58.470
What's that?

01:18:58.512 --> 01:19:01.848
Chloroform.
Stole it from the doc's.

01:19:04.517 --> 01:19:06.686
You gonna arrest me
for that, Marshal?

01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:13.901
Jesus.

01:19:54.938 --> 01:19:56.940
Well, looky here.

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:58.817
He's asleep.

01:19:58.902 --> 01:20:00.611
No.

01:20:01.779 --> 01:20:03.405
Looky here.

01:20:04.448 --> 01:20:06.407
Put 'em down.

01:20:10.078 --> 01:20:11.579
This way.

01:20:24.132 --> 01:20:26.051
What do you think?
Do you like it?

01:20:27.427 --> 01:20:29.346
You like it,
you son of a buck, you?

01:20:29.429 --> 01:20:31.263
- Huh?

01:20:31.348 --> 01:20:34.016
A little bit more?
A bit more?

01:20:34.101 --> 01:20:35.309
A bit more.

01:20:39.188 --> 01:20:42.441
Wasn't no call to leave me
setting out like that.

01:20:42.483 --> 01:20:45.986
- There wasn't a lot of time.
- I ain't bait, Charley.

01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:51.951
I hear you.

01:20:51.991 --> 01:20:53.785
Best you remember it.

01:20:53.828 --> 01:20:57.080
Well, I guess you ain't gonna
let me forget, are you?

01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:01.625
Starting to enjoy that part,
aren't you?

01:21:08.132 --> 01:21:09.258
Sorry if we woke you.

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:10.759
No, no.
You didn't.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.804
- Come to see if...
- Go see for yourself.

01:21:17.808 --> 01:21:19.308
Hey.

01:21:20.269 --> 01:21:22.019
- Hey, Boss.
- Hey.

01:21:22.103 --> 01:21:23.771
You gave us a fright, pard.

01:21:23.813 --> 01:21:26.399
Thought we was gonna lose you.

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:29.193
Just taking a little nap,
that's all.

01:21:29.277 --> 01:21:31.153
It's good to have you back.

01:21:31.236 --> 01:21:33.613
We owe you, Miss Barlow,
and we thank you.

01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:35.449
You best thank God instead.

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:39.828
Yes, ma'am.
We'll... give that a try.

01:21:39.869 --> 01:21:42.080
Well, I expect you men
are hungry.

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:43.248
Button just ate.

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:45.916
I thought I'd make myself
some breakfast.

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:48.836
Two more mouths wouldn't be
any bother.

01:21:48.919 --> 01:21:51.672
I'm just gonna change.

01:21:51.755 --> 01:21:54.674
You.
You should try to sleep.

01:21:54.758 --> 01:21:56.886
He will.

01:21:56.968 --> 01:21:59.596
Now, you do as she says now.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.347
Yes, Boss.

01:22:01.431 --> 01:22:03.224
Okay.

01:22:04.893 --> 01:22:06.186
Boss?

01:22:06.227 --> 01:22:07.478
Yeah?

01:22:08.479 --> 01:22:10.189
Mose?

01:22:10.273 --> 01:22:12.691
I'll be along in a minute,
Charley.

01:22:12.734 --> 01:22:15.319
Be seeing you, Button.

01:22:40.927 --> 01:22:42.636
Aah.

01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:20.226
If you don't mind my saying,
ma'am, you look...

01:24:22.312 --> 01:24:23.563
Tired.

01:24:23.645 --> 01:24:27.274
Oh.
It's been a long night.

01:24:27.317 --> 01:24:29.359
Why don't you sit?

01:24:31.654 --> 01:24:34.114
Let an old cowpoke cook up
some breakfast.

01:24:34.198 --> 01:24:37.034
No, I couldn't let you.

01:24:37.117 --> 01:24:38.660
Sure, you could.

01:24:41.246 --> 01:24:43.247
Thank you.

01:24:45.751 --> 01:24:49.837
I want to apologize
for earlier.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.422
Oh, no, no.
There's no need.

01:24:51.505 --> 01:24:52.757
You were startled.

01:24:52.839 --> 01:24:56.301
No, it was more than that.

01:24:58.011 --> 01:25:00.347
I've been trying to put
some bad times behind me.

01:25:00.388 --> 01:25:04.016
But sometimes
they don't stay put.

01:25:05.519 --> 01:25:07.979
Always makes me feel better
to let things breathe a little.

01:25:08.062 --> 01:25:09.480
Not bury them.

01:25:09.522 --> 01:25:12.858
I'm learning that.
Trying, anyway.

01:25:12.942 --> 01:25:15.861
Well, that's all
any of us can do.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.948
Just glad Button's
getting better.

01:25:19.739 --> 01:25:23.326
Don't believe I've ever seen
Boss so worried.

01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:25.370
Well, the doctor will be
on his way home

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:28.455
as soon as the storm's passed.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.543
By the doctor,
you mean your brother?

01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:38.715
It's just we've been thinking
that you and the doc was...

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.051
husband and wife.

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:42.594
Oh.

01:25:43.553 --> 01:25:45.888
You did?

01:25:45.931 --> 01:25:49.225
Didn't find out
till last night.

01:25:49.268 --> 01:25:51.811
Thought you was married, Sue.

01:25:51.894 --> 01:25:54.189
Why, no.
I'm...

01:25:54.230 --> 01:25:56.566
I'm not, Charley.

01:25:58.233 --> 01:26:02.071
Well, that's good.
I mean that's good to know.

01:26:02.154 --> 01:26:04.865
Otherwise,
we'd been thinking wrong.

01:26:04.906 --> 01:26:06.324
We wouldn't want to do that.

01:26:06.409 --> 01:26:09.745
No.
No, of course not.

01:26:30.264 --> 01:26:32.182
Much obliged to you, ma'am.

01:26:32.266 --> 01:26:34.934
You're very welcome,
Mr. Spearman.

01:26:37.228 --> 01:26:38.938
Thank you, Sue.

01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:42.734
Take care of yourself,
Charley.

01:26:54.203 --> 01:26:57.873
Are you just gonna go off like
that without saying nothing?

01:26:57.955 --> 01:26:59.248
Ain't nothing to say.

01:26:59.291 --> 01:27:02.126
I seen how you look at that gal
and the way she looks at you.

01:27:02.168 --> 01:27:04.087
It ain't right to walk away
without a word.

01:27:04.128 --> 01:27:07.131
What do you want me
to tell her, Boss?

01:27:07.173 --> 01:27:09.257
We probably ain't gonna make it?

01:27:09.342 --> 01:27:12.469
Be a big fat comfort.

01:27:14.221 --> 01:27:16.473
I don't know what you should
tell her, Charley.

01:27:16.556 --> 01:27:20.351
I wish I'd have said more
to my wife before she passed.

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:23.313
This may be the last time she
sees you in this world, Charley.

01:27:23.354 --> 01:27:24.439
Or you her.

01:27:24.522 --> 01:27:25.981
So tell her whatever you can.

01:27:26.066 --> 01:27:28.484
'Cause she's entitled to more
than just your backside

01:27:28.526 --> 01:27:31.112
walking away.

01:27:37.283 --> 01:27:38.660
Charley.

01:27:40.245 --> 01:27:45.250
I'm not sure
what's worth saying or not.

01:27:45.332 --> 01:27:47.168
Well, you don't have to
say anything.

01:27:47.252 --> 01:27:49.420
Yeah, I do.

01:27:49.503 --> 01:27:51.964
Boss is right about that.

01:27:52.048 --> 01:27:54.842
He's right
about a lot of things.

01:27:54.925 --> 01:27:56.427
It's just...

01:28:01.265 --> 01:28:02.890
I'm not who you think
I am, Sue.

01:28:02.975 --> 01:28:05.768
I've... been places.
I've done things.

01:28:05.853 --> 01:28:08.188
Most of them, I'm not proud of.

01:28:09.355 --> 01:28:13.817
You know, I always hoped
somebody gentle and caring

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.861
might come along.

01:28:18.364 --> 01:28:21.701
Years pass.
A small town and all.

01:28:21.742 --> 01:28:25.954
And your hopes begin to fade
a little every day

01:28:26.037 --> 01:28:29.623
until you hardly remember
what they were.

01:28:29.708 --> 01:28:32.002
I've seen who you are, Charley.

01:28:32.043 --> 01:28:34.462
The way you looked after
that boy

01:28:34.545 --> 01:28:37.173
and the respect you give Boss.

01:28:37.256 --> 01:28:38.424
It might be little bits.

01:28:38.507 --> 01:28:42.594
But they're enough
for a woman who looks.

01:28:46.055 --> 01:28:48.391
Men are gonna get killed
here today, Sue.

01:28:48.434 --> 01:28:50.435
And I'm gonna kill them.

01:28:50.518 --> 01:28:52.437
You understand that?

01:28:53.353 --> 01:28:55.065
Yes.

01:28:57.776 --> 01:28:59.860
I want you to have this.

01:28:59.944 --> 01:29:02.279
It's always brought me luck.

01:29:02.362 --> 01:29:06.866
I... can't take your locket.

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:10.912
It's not your choice
when it's a gift.

01:29:11.621 --> 01:29:13.664
It's a good likeness of you.

01:29:14.707 --> 01:29:17.585
It's my mother
when she was young.

01:29:19.504 --> 01:29:22.215
She's beautiful.

01:29:27.135 --> 01:29:31.264
I want you to know that
if I don't ever see you again

01:29:31.348 --> 01:29:34.393
that I meant everything
I said to you

01:29:34.434 --> 01:29:38.563
and I appreciate everything
you said to me.

01:29:38.646 --> 01:29:41.982
Ain't nothing that happened in
this old town been a surprise.

01:29:42.067 --> 01:29:44.443
Except you.

01:29:55.996 --> 01:29:58.665
I'll be seeing you,
Charley Waite.

01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:14.888
Happy?

01:30:14.972 --> 01:30:17.433
Yeah.
If you are.

01:30:40.745 --> 01:30:42.998
Morning, boys.

01:30:45.541 --> 01:30:47.126
Brung you breakfast.

01:30:49.504 --> 01:30:51.672
Hey, you kids.
Come away from there.

01:30:51.756 --> 01:30:53.507
Come on.

01:30:53.549 --> 01:30:54.967
You get along.

01:31:06.936 --> 01:31:09.564
What do you suppose
this looks like?

01:31:09.646 --> 01:31:11.775
It don't matter.

01:31:11.858 --> 01:31:14.276
Whole town knows
there's a fight coming.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.529
They just hope it don't
spill over to them.

01:31:29.207 --> 01:31:32.001
Well, if I'm gonna get killed,

01:31:32.043 --> 01:31:36.005
I got a hankering to soothe
my sweet tooth.

01:31:40.717 --> 01:31:42.302
Morning.

01:31:42.928 --> 01:31:45.013
Morning.

01:31:47.557 --> 01:31:50.018
What can I do for you fellers?

01:31:50.059 --> 01:31:52.896
Thinking about some candy.

01:31:52.979 --> 01:31:54.898
- Candy?
- Yeah.

01:31:55.564 --> 01:31:57.858
Yes, sir.
Candy.

01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.443
Got anything you want.

01:31:59.528 --> 01:32:01.904
- Got jawbreakers.
- Yeah.

01:32:01.987 --> 01:32:07.033
Gumdrops, candy canes,
licorice, caramel, honey crisp.

01:32:07.076 --> 01:32:09.744
Jujubes, lollipops,
milk chocolate...

01:32:09.828 --> 01:32:11.413
Looking for something special.

01:32:11.496 --> 01:32:14.541
Now, what's the most expensive
you've got?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.460
Well...

01:32:17.544 --> 01:32:20.254
Ooh.
I got just the thing.

01:32:29.388 --> 01:32:31.515
- This is dark chocolate.
- Yeah.

01:32:31.597 --> 01:32:34.517
It comes all the way
from Switzerland, Europe.

01:32:34.601 --> 01:32:36.936
That's near France, see.

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.980
They call it bittersweet.

01:32:39.064 --> 01:32:41.065
Melts in your mouth.

01:32:41.107 --> 01:32:43.234
- You tried it?
- No.

01:32:43.276 --> 01:32:45.611
How do you know
it melts in your mouth?

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:52.451
Well, truth is
we can't afford it ourselves.

01:32:52.492 --> 01:32:55.495
Mm-hmm.
I'll take two.

01:32:55.579 --> 01:32:57.039
Don't you want to know how much?

01:32:57.122 --> 01:32:58.707
Nope.

01:32:58.789 --> 01:33:00.167
Yes, sir.

01:33:01.043 --> 01:33:04.087
And three of your finest cigars.

01:33:04.128 --> 01:33:08.299
My friend and me got a hankering
for Switzerland chocolate

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.426
and a good smoke.

01:33:18.099 --> 01:33:21.686
Now, these come all the way
from Havana, Cuba.

01:33:21.771 --> 01:33:23.772
Thank you.

01:33:23.855 --> 01:33:26.316
- Anything else?
- No. That'll do it.

01:33:26.357 --> 01:33:28.442
How much I owe you?

01:33:28.485 --> 01:33:30.861
It's... $5.

01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:36.784
Charley.

01:33:36.867 --> 01:33:39.161
Here you are.

01:33:39.203 --> 01:33:40.996
Believe I'll enjoy
these later, Boss.

01:33:41.079 --> 01:33:42.372
Yep.

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:46.335
You ought to do yourselves
a favor and ride on

01:33:46.376 --> 01:33:48.669
while you still got time.

01:33:48.711 --> 01:33:50.962
Tried minding
our own business.

01:33:54.007 --> 01:33:55.467
This is good.

01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:57.512
Worth every penny.

01:34:01.556 --> 01:34:03.850
You're gonna
get yourselves killed.

01:34:03.892 --> 01:34:05.351
Try that, Ralph.

01:34:05.394 --> 01:34:07.062
Go on.

01:34:10.023 --> 01:34:11.565
Sitting right here
in front of you.

01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:13.527
Never even tried it.

01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:19.699
Shame to go forever without
taking a taste of something.

01:34:25.787 --> 01:34:28.749
Charley, let's go.

01:34:32.252 --> 01:34:33.461
Percy!

01:34:33.544 --> 01:34:35.171
Up here!

01:34:35.213 --> 01:34:37.715
Brought you a cigar.
All the way from Havana, Cuba.

01:34:37.799 --> 01:34:39.049
You don't say?

01:34:39.133 --> 01:34:41.093
I've heard about them,
but I never had one.

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:43.387
Much obliged to you.

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:44.722
What do you think?

01:34:44.763 --> 01:34:47.599
Better than them crappers
I usually smoke.

01:34:47.683 --> 01:34:49.435
So, you're gonna make
your stand down here?

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.936
Yeah.
But out there around our wagon.

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:56.023
Not much choice without getting
a lot of innocent folks shot up.

01:34:56.065 --> 01:34:57.818
Like to place some guns and ammo

01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.652
where we can get to it
on a short run.

01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:01.112
Help yourself.

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:03.197
We'll try to stay
out of your barn.

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:04.866
Might not be able to.

01:35:04.906 --> 01:35:07.242
Best bring in your livestock.

01:35:07.951 --> 01:35:09.369
Be wishing you good luck now.

01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:10.912
Thank you.

01:35:30.973 --> 01:35:33.641
It's a pretty day
for making things right.

01:35:33.726 --> 01:35:34.976
Well, enjoy it.

01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:36.603
Because once it starts,

01:35:36.686 --> 01:35:39.022
it's gonna be messy
like nothing you ever seen.

01:35:39.105 --> 01:35:40.440
I ain't survived my years

01:35:40.522 --> 01:35:42.817
without being in
some fights, Charley.

01:35:44.903 --> 01:35:46.862
I ain't doubting
your grit, Boss.

01:35:46.946 --> 01:35:48.573
You got more than any man
I ever known.

01:35:48.655 --> 01:35:51.033
It's just that...

01:35:51.116 --> 01:35:52.451
I don't mean to be hard.

01:35:52.493 --> 01:35:54.119
It's just the other night,
them fellows

01:35:54.203 --> 01:35:55.954
back in them trees we let go.

01:35:56.038 --> 01:35:57.955
It was my call, Charley.

01:35:57.998 --> 01:35:59.957
I can see now
it was probably a mistake.

01:36:00.042 --> 01:36:03.252
It's not what I meant.
I mean, maybe it was.

01:36:03.294 --> 01:36:06.422
But the fact is it's what I
always respected about you.

01:36:06.506 --> 01:36:09.591
What I always appreciated.

01:36:09.675 --> 01:36:13.846
How you treated other people
and how you treated me.

01:36:13.929 --> 01:36:16.807
How you never look
for no trouble.

01:36:16.848 --> 01:36:19.893
That kept me from trouble.

01:36:19.976 --> 01:36:21.395
But it's found us here, Boss.

01:36:21.478 --> 01:36:24.439
And if we're to have
any chance, you'll...

01:36:24.481 --> 01:36:27.818
You go on and talk, Charley.
I'll hear you.

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.151
I'm almost certain

01:36:29.236 --> 01:36:32.321
they'll be overly confident
in their numbers.

01:36:32.405 --> 01:36:35.199
Especially if we're standing
right out here in front of them.

01:36:35.282 --> 01:36:36.867
It's not like we'll have
any advantage.

01:36:36.951 --> 01:36:38.910
But if they're out there
with us,

01:36:38.994 --> 01:36:42.206
then they won't have as much
as they might have otherwise.

01:36:42.288 --> 01:36:44.416
I don't figure all of them
to be killers.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:47.460
Only two or three like Butler
will have done much of it.

01:36:47.502 --> 01:36:49.545
I'll be looking to him.

01:36:50.588 --> 01:36:53.633
The others will be hired men.
Probably saddle tramps.

01:36:53.675 --> 01:36:56.093
Maybe ex-Army.

01:36:56.176 --> 01:36:57.803
The rest will be cowpunchers.

01:36:57.845 --> 01:37:00.681
They won't want to line up
in front of us.

01:37:01.807 --> 01:37:03.641
It'll happen fast
once I start.

01:37:03.684 --> 01:37:06.895
So just keep yourself
moving forward.

01:37:06.978 --> 01:37:10.732
And they'll either move or root.
Maybe even freeze up.

01:37:10.816 --> 01:37:12.900
It don't matter which.

01:37:12.984 --> 01:37:15.737
You just start right in on them
with that scatter-gun.

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:19.489
When you've done both barrels,
drop it, pull your pistol,

01:37:19.532 --> 01:37:22.659
and make a run for that building
where we stashed them others.

01:37:22.702 --> 01:37:24.661
I'll be trying to do the same
if I can.

01:37:24.703 --> 01:37:26.038
Right.

01:37:26.121 --> 01:37:29.541
Sounds like you got it
all worked out.

01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:30.751
Yeah.

01:37:30.834 --> 01:37:33.211
Except the part
where we don't get killed.

01:37:34.462 --> 01:37:38.340
Best smoke these
while we got the chance.

01:37:38.382 --> 01:37:40.384
Yeah.

01:38:05.532 --> 01:38:09.703
I'm thinking about getting out
of the damn cattle business.

01:38:12.623 --> 01:38:14.875
You never said nothing
except nag me and Button

01:38:14.917 --> 01:38:17.001
about getting ourselves out.

01:38:17.086 --> 01:38:19.671
Well, maybe my own words
struck a chord.

01:38:19.754 --> 01:38:22.673
Thought maybe
I'd sell off the cattle

01:38:22.757 --> 01:38:27.052
and have enough to start up
a saloon somewhere.

01:38:27.095 --> 01:38:29.680
Man could stay cool
in the summer

01:38:29.763 --> 01:38:31.682
and dry in the winter.

01:38:34.184 --> 01:38:38.104
Some dancing girls might be
nice, you know?

01:38:38.146 --> 01:38:40.106
Have to get me some.

01:38:42.858 --> 01:38:44.443
Yeah.

01:38:49.365 --> 01:38:54.412
"If I die,
please sell my good horse

01:38:54.453 --> 01:38:57.664
and my good saddle and my guns

01:38:57.748 --> 01:39:02.877
to buy a tea set
for Miss Barlow. "

01:39:03.628 --> 01:39:05.839
"Charley Waite. "

01:39:09.384 --> 01:39:11.302
"Postscript...

01:39:11.343 --> 01:39:13.804
I like this one.

01:39:13.888 --> 01:39:15.889
But I don't know. "

01:39:16.807 --> 01:39:19.268
"Princess pattern. "

01:39:23.313 --> 01:39:24.439
Oh, hell.

01:39:24.523 --> 01:39:26.400
What's the matter?

01:39:28.568 --> 01:39:31.362
Oh.
Looks like you waited too long.

01:39:31.445 --> 01:39:34.614
Kind of like us
and free grazing.

01:39:34.699 --> 01:39:37.617
Well, good is good.

01:39:37.702 --> 01:39:39.494
Melted or not.

01:39:49.003 --> 01:39:52.966
Looks like you're plumb chained,
to your work, Marshal.

01:39:53.007 --> 01:39:54.467
Get up, Poole.

01:39:54.508 --> 01:39:56.844
He ain't worth a damn.

01:39:56.927 --> 01:39:58.846
Get them all up!

01:39:58.929 --> 01:40:00.681
Sobered up!

01:40:02.016 --> 01:40:03.516
Ooh.

01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:09.105
I got a feeling there's gonna be
a new marshal in town.

01:40:12.609 --> 01:40:13.485
All right!

01:40:13.526 --> 01:40:17.238
It's time to settle
these free grazers.

01:40:17.321 --> 01:40:19.198
Oh, you leave your horses.

01:40:20.366 --> 01:40:23.160
We're walking down
to their wagon.

01:40:23.202 --> 01:40:25.996
When we get there, you better
empty your guns in them.

01:40:26.038 --> 01:40:28.664
Or I'll damn well
shoot you myself.

01:40:32.503 --> 01:40:34.921
Now, you three skirt
the buildings.

01:40:35.004 --> 01:40:36.673
Get into the alleys
on the side.

01:40:36.714 --> 01:40:38.841
- Come on.

01:41:08.201 --> 01:41:11.747
Hayley!
Come away from there.

01:41:14.249 --> 01:41:16.085
Finish these later.

01:41:21.423 --> 01:41:23.425
Okay.

01:41:23.465 --> 01:41:26.845
I'm not going to my maker
without knowing your given name.

01:41:26.927 --> 01:41:30.222
Mine ain't Waite.
It's Postelwaite.

01:41:30.264 --> 01:41:32.683
Charles Travis Postelwaite.

01:41:32.766 --> 01:41:34.393
What's yours?

01:41:35.226 --> 01:41:37.146
Sure ain't Boss.

01:41:41.482 --> 01:41:44.777
I mean it, Boss.
I'm asking you straight up.

01:41:44.819 --> 01:41:46.821
It's Bluebonnet.

01:41:48.239 --> 01:41:49.115
Bluebonnet?

01:41:49.157 --> 01:41:51.325
Bluebonnet, yeah.

01:41:51.409 --> 01:41:52.242
No middle name?

01:41:52.285 --> 01:41:56.121
No, just Bluebonnet Spearman.
And don't you tell no one.

01:41:57.372 --> 01:42:00.917
I want to hear you swear
an oath. Now, go on.

01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:02.085
I swear it.

01:42:02.169 --> 01:42:04.963
All right.
Okay.

01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:09.426
Just in case.

01:42:25.357 --> 01:42:28.026
Said eight.
Count five.

01:42:34.324 --> 01:42:37.452
You should have run when you
had the chance, Spearman.

01:42:37.493 --> 01:42:40.120
Not much for running
from cowards.

01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:43.582
I see the marshal ain't
with you.

01:42:43.666 --> 01:42:45.501
You won't find it so funny

01:42:45.541 --> 01:42:48.379
when you're all shot to hell
and dying.

01:43:01.182 --> 01:43:04.267
- You the one killed our friend?
- That's right.

01:43:04.352 --> 01:43:07.562
I shot the boy, too,
and I enjoyed it.

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:41.316
Hayley!

01:44:44.194 --> 01:44:46.028
Back up!

01:44:50.115 --> 01:44:51.492
Where's the back door?

01:44:51.576 --> 01:44:53.661
- Back door!
- Right this way.

01:45:17.391 --> 01:45:19.434
It's locked.

01:45:38.536 --> 01:45:40.371
You hit?

01:45:40.454 --> 01:45:41.997
I'm good.

01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:46.042
You.

01:45:51.715 --> 01:45:53.757
You get out of this house!

01:45:59.722 --> 01:46:01.557
You pull that trigger, Baxter,

01:46:01.641 --> 01:46:04.518
and you can forget about me
patching you up.

01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:10.315
You get your bag.
You're with me.

01:46:10.357 --> 01:46:12.151
Go on.

01:48:09.009 --> 01:48:12.636
Get the hell up, Poole!
On your feet, God damn it!

01:48:16.182 --> 01:48:18.475
Yeah!

01:48:18.518 --> 01:48:21.812
You're... going out there.

01:48:21.854 --> 01:48:24.605
We ain't ourselves yet!

01:48:46.168 --> 01:48:48.086
I see they hobbled you.

01:48:48.170 --> 01:48:50.505
It's been a while
since I was in a fight.

01:48:50.547 --> 01:48:53.341
I panicked. Fell back.
Like to have broke my foot.

01:48:53.425 --> 01:48:54.593
Ornery old fool.

01:48:54.675 --> 01:48:57.845
Well, or that damn Cuban cigar
got me riled up.

01:49:02.016 --> 01:49:03.476
Charley.

01:49:03.517 --> 01:49:04.976
You two wait here.

01:49:05.019 --> 01:49:07.187
Hold on, there, Charley.
Hold on.

01:49:07.271 --> 01:49:09.773
I ain't looking over my shoulder
the rest of my days.

01:49:09.857 --> 01:49:11.816
Charley.

01:49:11.859 --> 01:49:14.069
You said we was gonna
kill them all.

01:49:14.152 --> 01:49:15.987
I aim to do just that.

01:49:16.029 --> 01:49:17.780
I meant kill them.
Not murder them.

01:49:17.864 --> 01:49:19.866
Splitting hairs,
ain't you, Boss?

01:49:19.948 --> 01:49:23.495
Mister, I heard what you said.

01:49:24.286 --> 01:49:25.871
I won't come after you.
I promise.

01:49:25.955 --> 01:49:28.040
No, I expect you won't.

01:49:28.123 --> 01:49:30.376
I ain't gonna let you
do it, Charley.

01:49:30.459 --> 01:49:32.628
You do this, you ain't no
different than Poole or Baxter

01:49:32.711 --> 01:49:35.881
or that gunhand of his
that murdered Mose.

01:49:35.965 --> 01:49:38.049
Him killing Mose
is how this started.

01:49:38.132 --> 01:49:40.052
We come for justice,
not vengeance.

01:49:40.134 --> 01:49:41.803
Them is two different things.

01:49:41.886 --> 01:49:43.804
Not today, they ain't.

01:49:45.056 --> 01:49:46.015
Step aside!

01:49:46.057 --> 01:49:47.767
Listen to him, son.

01:49:47.849 --> 01:49:50.894
You done what you had to here
because they give you no choice.

01:49:50.979 --> 01:49:53.814
Don't go making this
into something bad.

01:49:55.273 --> 01:49:57.442
This ain't the way, pard.

01:50:09.745 --> 01:50:12.540
Mister, thank you.

01:50:12.581 --> 01:50:13.873
Thank you.

01:50:13.916 --> 01:50:15.710
Didn't do it for you, boy.

01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:18.421
Just make peace
with your bad deeds.

01:50:22.007 --> 01:50:23.758
Sue!

01:50:23.842 --> 01:50:25.593
Get in here!

01:50:25.677 --> 01:50:28.013
Oh, my God.

01:50:36.395 --> 01:50:37.813
Get out of the way.

01:50:40.274 --> 01:50:42.066
Button!

01:51:10.259 --> 01:51:12.720
- Put it down.
- Let the lady be!

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:12.150
We got your boy, Spearman!

01:52:21.534 --> 01:52:24.870
You better drop them guns
and come walking down the street

01:52:24.912 --> 01:52:27.289
or I shoot him.

01:52:27.373 --> 01:52:29.500
You've got ten seconds!

01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:33.838
We ain't giving up our guns.

01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.797
He's gonna kill Button anyway.

01:52:35.881 --> 01:52:36.840
One!

01:52:36.882 --> 01:52:40.260
The only chance for him or us
when we walk up is these guns.

01:52:40.343 --> 01:52:42.511
Two!

01:52:44.306 --> 01:52:45.973
Three!

01:52:46.057 --> 01:52:47.016
Sue!

01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:48.934
Stop!

01:52:49.018 --> 01:52:52.479
Stop it!
Stop it right now!

01:52:58.234 --> 01:52:59.777
Four!

01:53:01.196 --> 01:53:03.198
Sue.

01:53:03.281 --> 01:53:05.867
You're a disgrace,
Marshal Poole.

01:53:05.908 --> 01:53:09.119
You always have been.

01:53:09.203 --> 01:53:12.415
I know it.
That's just the way it is.

01:53:13.791 --> 01:53:15.418
Five!

01:53:17.502 --> 01:53:19.338
Six!

01:53:42.651 --> 01:53:45.236
Have a nice rest,
did you, Marshal?

01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:47.906
You'll be having a long one
yourself in a minute.

01:53:47.948 --> 01:53:49.449
Been enough killing for you?

01:53:49.491 --> 01:53:52.409
Be enough when you're
both dead and buried.

01:53:54.955 --> 01:53:57.206
Let the woman and boy go.
They ain't a part of this.

01:53:57.289 --> 01:53:59.750
If you want considerations,

01:53:59.833 --> 01:54:02.168
you drop them guns
on the ground.

01:54:02.252 --> 01:54:03.879
Let her take him to the doc's.

01:54:03.963 --> 01:54:06.465
The doc's in jail,
and he ain't leaving

01:54:06.548 --> 01:54:09.217
unless your guns
are in the dirt.

01:54:10.093 --> 01:54:13.471
I'll crush any man
who stands with them!

01:54:13.554 --> 01:54:14.597
When I finish that,

01:54:14.639 --> 01:54:17.934
I'll torch your homes and drive
your wives and children

01:54:17.976 --> 01:54:20.979
out into the cold prairie.

01:54:21.061 --> 01:54:24.398
So you women, you better
take hold of your men.

01:54:24.481 --> 01:54:27.651
If you don't, you'll be raising
orphans by winter.

01:54:28.694 --> 01:54:30.570
Mack Langly!

01:54:31.697 --> 01:54:34.449
It doesn't matter
whether you run or stay!

01:54:34.491 --> 01:54:37.786
You and your boys
are already dead!

01:54:38.662 --> 01:54:41.372
Mack Langly is our friend!

01:54:52.299 --> 01:54:54.426
I didn't come all the way
from Ireland

01:54:54.509 --> 01:54:58.596
to see my land pissed on
by free grazers.

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:03.142
Now, I want them guns
in the dirt.

01:55:04.269 --> 01:55:06.146
Him first.

01:55:06.186 --> 01:55:08.272
The gunhand.

01:55:51.019 --> 01:55:53.605
Looks like you're losing
your army, Marshal.

01:56:11.914 --> 01:56:13.583
Get down!

01:56:52.994 --> 01:56:54.787
It went through?

01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:56.290
Yeah.

01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:58.249
Is he hit, Sue?

01:57:00.084 --> 01:57:01.711
- Sue, is he hit?
- No! No!

01:57:01.794 --> 01:57:03.713
But he's bleeding bad again!

01:57:03.795 --> 01:57:05.881
God damn it.
Can you stop it?

01:57:05.964 --> 01:57:06.965
I'm trying.

01:57:07.049 --> 01:57:08.800
I'm gonna kill you, Baxter!

01:57:08.883 --> 01:57:11.553
Well, come on, if you're coming!

01:57:15.974 --> 01:57:17.308
Can you cover me?

01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:20.936
Might be best to wait him out.
Probably bleed to death.

01:57:23.230 --> 01:57:24.315
I ain't waiting.

01:57:24.398 --> 01:57:26.317
Button needs that doctor
right now.

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:28.027
Well, you know,
that door's locked.

01:57:28.110 --> 01:57:30.695
Well, it won't be
when the scatter-gun hits it.

01:57:30.779 --> 01:57:33.281
I'm waiting for you, Spearman!

01:57:35.826 --> 01:57:38.828
I'm coming for you,
you son of a bitch.

01:57:41.497 --> 01:57:43.666
Okay, Charley?

01:57:43.749 --> 01:57:44.959
Yeah.

01:57:45.001 --> 01:57:46.878
You ready?

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:49.296
Yeah.

01:58:45.098 --> 01:58:46.516
I'm dying.

01:58:46.557 --> 01:58:49.519
And for what?
More cows?

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:51.186
Killed a good man.

01:58:51.271 --> 01:58:53.522
And maybe that boy
out there out yonder.

01:58:53.564 --> 01:58:56.066
You get no sympathy
for your death.

01:58:56.108 --> 01:58:58.069
Get!

01:58:58.110 --> 01:59:01.196
You're... nothing.

01:59:01.237 --> 01:59:03.365
Yeah? Maybe so.

01:59:03.448 --> 01:59:06.742
But I'll still be breathing
in another minute.

01:59:06.827 --> 01:59:10.246
Well, kill me, then.

01:59:18.754 --> 01:59:19.921
No.

01:59:21.256 --> 01:59:23.675
I ain't wasting a good bullet
to ease your pain,

01:59:23.758 --> 01:59:25.594
you son of a bitch.

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:33.086
Your man's in the saloon.

02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:36.507
Ordered everybody out.

02:01:37.424 --> 02:01:41.219
Asked to see your sister
iffen she's willing.

02:01:48.892 --> 02:01:50.644
He'd like to speak with you,
Miss Barlow,

02:01:50.729 --> 02:01:53.607
iffen you ain't offended
by entering a saloon.

02:02:02.739 --> 02:02:04.282
Sue.

02:02:08.745 --> 02:02:10.204
Doc.

02:02:10.246 --> 02:02:11.706
Bring him on up.

02:02:11.747 --> 02:02:13.958
Put him in there.
We'll make room.

02:02:21.632 --> 02:02:23.133
Baxter got any kin?

02:02:23.216 --> 02:02:25.093
Daughter is all he has left.

02:02:25.177 --> 02:02:28.055
It'd be right if somebody
explained things to her.

02:02:28.096 --> 02:02:31.224
There never was
any love lost between 'em.

02:02:31.266 --> 02:02:33.351
Even so, she's his daughter.

02:02:33.435 --> 02:02:36.229
And kin is funny
about such things.

02:02:50.033 --> 02:02:52.035
Come on.
Come on.

02:03:19.852 --> 02:03:21.937
I didn't mean for you
to have to...

02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:24.607
walk into this place
in front of those people.

02:03:24.648 --> 02:03:28.194
I don't care what anyone
out there thinks, Charley.

02:03:28.277 --> 02:03:30.822
You don't have to
stand up for me.

02:03:32.573 --> 02:03:33.615
Well, just the same,

02:03:33.698 --> 02:03:37.995
I wanted to tell you that I'll
be leaving in a day or two.

02:03:44.625 --> 02:03:47.128
I'd like you to stay.

02:03:47.210 --> 02:03:49.338
I think others would, too.

02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:53.968
I can't say I haven't
thought about it.

02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:56.636
Truth is, there wouldn't be
a corner here

02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:59.430
that don't have
a bad memory for me.

02:04:03.393 --> 02:04:06.687
I've been holding my love
a long time, Charley.

02:04:07.771 --> 02:04:10.816
I know you feel something
for me, too.

02:04:13.402 --> 02:04:14.987
I do.

02:04:17.531 --> 02:04:20.033
But I ain't no more
than those who come to kill us.

02:04:20.075 --> 02:04:22.578
You seen that yourself.

02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:24.829
Maybe you've done
some bad things.

02:04:24.913 --> 02:04:26.331
Maybe worse than bad.

02:04:26.372 --> 02:04:29.667
But what happened here today
wasn't one of 'em.

02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:37.591
And those killings,
they don't give you pause?

02:04:38.384 --> 02:04:41.094
I'm not afraid of you, Charley.

02:04:58.109 --> 02:05:00.320
It brought me luck.

02:05:00.403 --> 02:05:02.073
Just like you said.

02:05:03.657 --> 02:05:05.575
It's yours now.

02:05:05.617 --> 02:05:07.202
You keep it.

02:05:13.875 --> 02:05:15.376
I don't have the answers,
Charley.

02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:17.921
But I know that people
get confused in this life

02:05:17.962 --> 02:05:23.008
about what they want
and what they've done

02:05:23.092 --> 02:05:26.177
and what they think they
should have because of it.

02:05:26.262 --> 02:05:30.598
Everything they think they are
or did takes hold so hard

02:05:30.682 --> 02:05:34.227
that it won't let them see
what they can be.

02:05:38.230 --> 02:05:41.067
I've got a big idea
about us, Charley.

02:05:42.485 --> 02:05:44.778
And I'm not gonna wait forever.

02:05:44.861 --> 02:05:46.780
But I am gonna wait.

02:05:46.863 --> 02:05:51.994
And when you're far away,
I want you to think about that.

02:05:52.953 --> 02:05:57.291
And... come back to me.

02:08:33.602 --> 02:08:35.729
I'm in love with you, Sue.

02:08:37.521 --> 02:08:40.566
Been that way since
I first laid eyes on you.

02:08:40.608 --> 02:08:45.237
Just took me a while
to see things clear.

02:08:47.114 --> 02:08:48.532
I know I'm not the kind of man

02:08:48.615 --> 02:08:51.075
you expected to walk up
your front walk.

02:08:52.076 --> 02:08:55.955
If I was your brother,
I wouldn't choose me for you.

02:09:01.251 --> 02:09:02.921
Charley...

02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:07.758
Do you know how old I am?

02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:10.928
Don't care how old you are.

02:09:10.969 --> 02:09:13.012
I'm not a girl anymore.

02:09:14.681 --> 02:09:17.851
You're the handsomest woman
I ever saw.

02:09:17.934 --> 02:09:20.604
I've had my disappointments,
Charley.

02:09:20.686 --> 02:09:22.813
Well, I'm not gonna be
one of them.

02:09:26.108 --> 02:09:28.903
I never thought I'd live
as long as I have, Sue.

02:09:28.985 --> 02:09:33.156
I guess living the way I have,
it never really mattered.

02:09:34.324 --> 02:09:37.994
But thinking I was never gonna
see you again was maybe...

02:09:39.663 --> 02:09:42.874
Was maybe the most awful feeling
I ever had in my life.

02:09:47.461 --> 02:09:52.007
I know I can be
a good husband to you.

02:09:53.133 --> 02:09:54.802
And I know I ain't
asked you proper.

02:09:54.843 --> 02:09:58.722
But I'm asking you now.

02:10:03.226 --> 02:10:05.687
Will you marry me, Sue?

02:10:08.982 --> 02:10:11.067
Charley.

02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:12.985
Yes.

02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:15.737
I'll marry you.

02:10:20.576 --> 02:10:22.618
And can I kiss you?

02:10:44.556 --> 02:10:48.518
I'm gonna give you a thousand
of these before I'm done.

02:11:10.623 --> 02:11:12.790
Hey, Charley!

02:11:12.874 --> 02:11:15.959
Looks like the doc
changed his mind about you.

02:11:22.633 --> 02:11:24.801
Something wrong?

02:11:24.885 --> 02:11:26.553
No.
Everything's fine.

02:11:26.637 --> 02:11:28.847
I forgot to tell you
I'll have word about the saloon

02:11:28.931 --> 02:11:29.890
by the time you get back.

02:11:29.973 --> 02:11:31.766
Sounds good.

02:11:33.477 --> 02:11:35.062
You take care, now.

02:11:36.647 --> 02:11:39.148
Charley.

02:11:39.233 --> 02:11:40.274
Sue.

02:11:40.358 --> 02:11:42.026
I'll be along.

02:11:47.114 --> 02:11:48.949
Saloon?

02:11:49.032 --> 02:11:51.952
Told you I was wanting out
of the cattle business.

02:11:52.036 --> 02:11:55.664
There's a saloon right back
there just had its owner die.

02:11:55.747 --> 02:11:57.665
Hoping you'd be my partner.

02:12:01.544 --> 02:12:04.338
I cant afford something like that.

02:12:04.381 --> 02:12:06.382
Not even half.

02:12:06.423 --> 02:12:10.009
Well let the brains of the outfith
do the thinking.

02:12:10.052 --> 02:12:18.434
Sue!

02:12:18.477 --> 02:12:22.313
You are coming back, aren't you?

02:12:22.355 --> 02:12:27.734
And i will be waiting for you Charles!

02:12:31.446 --> 02:12:36.785
Keep nothing private.

02:12:36.869 --> 02:12:42.123
Have to go back know.

02:12:42.165 --> 02:12:48.045
I don't want to loose side of the roof tops.

02:12:48.087 --> 02:12:53.217
I mean it Sue.

02:12:53.259 --> 02:12:58.306
Got to go!

02:12:58.346 --> 02:13:13.111
How this gonna work if
you don't do what i say.

02:13:13.152 --> 02:13:16.494
I told you, I'm gonna give you a
thousand of these before I'm done.

02:13:16.697 --> 02:13:18.991
I'm gonna make sure you do.

02:13:57.485 --> 02:13:59.403
Let's go get our cows!
