01:47.566 --> 01:51.070
<i>In Orkney, it's said
that people who have drowned</i>

01:51.070 --> 01:52.488
<i>turn into seals.</i>

01:55.032 --> 01:56.617
<i>We call them selkies.</i>

02:12.716 --> 02:13.843
<i>At the highest tides,</i>

02:13.843 --> 02:16.637
<i>they slip off their seal skins
for the night</i>

02:16.637 --> 02:19.557
<i>and they come to the shore
as beautiful people.</i>

02:21.308 --> 02:22.935
<i>And they dance together.</i>

02:22.935 --> 02:25.646
<i>Naked in the moonlight.</i>

02:41.370 --> 02:44.373
<i>The selkies
return to the sea at dawn.</i>

02:44.373 --> 02:46.709
<i>Unless they're seen by a person.</i>

02:47.209 --> 02:49.795
<i>And then they're trapped
in their human body</i>

02:50.421 --> 02:51.505
<i>and cannot return.</i>

02:58.846 --> 03:02.099
<i>And they'll always remain
discontent on land</i>

03:02.099 --> 03:04.768
<i>because they belong to the sea.</i>

03:16.739 --> 03:17.948
Oh, everyone's gone?

03:17.948 --> 03:20.451
Yeah, everyone's gone.
More for me.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.080
Rona?
What are you doing?

03:28.417 --> 03:29.960
Please, please, please, come on.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.545
Come on, I gotta get you out.

03:32.922 --> 03:34.173
- Time to go home.
- Why?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.134
I remember...

03:37.134 --> 03:39.303
That everyone
is really long gone.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.389
No, there was, erm...

03:45.476 --> 03:47.144
The lights are on.
The lights.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.021
That really means
the night is truly...

03:49.021 --> 03:49.939
Ow...

03:49.939 --> 03:51.440
Come on,
what are you doing, Rona?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.985
We gotta get you out now,
come on.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.904
- Come on. Come on, Rona.
- Let's dance.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.948
Fine, I'll dance
with you instead.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.617
- Mm...
- Dave?

04:06.121 --> 04:07.206
Ah-ha!

04:07.206 --> 04:08.332
-Come on.
- Dave.

04:08.332 --> 04:09.750
- Give me a twirl.
-She's long gone.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.045
Come on, love. The door's there
and you're going out of it.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.464
Under the table. Out you come.

04:15.464 --> 04:16.799
Come on. Out you come.

04:16.799 --> 04:18.300
- You're leaving now.
- You can't see me.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.427
- Right, right, right, Dave.
- Come on. Up you go.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.554
Stand up. Stand up.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.390
To the door.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.600
You're nearly there. Come on.

04:27.643 --> 04:28.936
You've had a bit too much.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.437
Dave,
please just get her out.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.564
- God, I'm strong.
-Come on.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.191
- Come on.
- Dave, what are you gonna do?

04:34.191 --> 04:35.693
You gonna make me leave?

04:35.693 --> 04:38.070
- I'm gonna take you outside.
-Rona!

04:38.070 --> 04:38.988
You're gonna

04:38.988 --> 04:40.614
- fucking make me leave?
- Enough!

04:41.073 --> 04:42.950
Fucking arsehole! Ahh!

04:44.368 --> 04:46.328
-Time to go.
- Get off of me!

04:47.246 --> 04:48.497
Ow!

04:48.497 --> 04:50.332
- Make him stop!
- Time to go.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.002
Arsehole!

05:11.603 --> 05:13.397
Hey, you need a ride?

05:14.106 --> 05:15.858
I can give you a lift,
if you like.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.369
Rona.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.830
Um, is it okay if I get
some details from you?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.040
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.541
Just check your age.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.126
Twenty-nine.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.669
And...

05:36.336 --> 05:37.713
What's your occupation?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.425
Er, I'm unemployed right now.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.511
But I got a masters in biology.

05:48.474 --> 05:49.850
Just get a few more details.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.064
So, are there any illnesses
that run in the family?

05:55.064 --> 05:57.524
Anything, like any heart attacks
or strokes?

05:57.524 --> 05:58.609
No.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.903
Any diabetes?

06:00.903 --> 06:01.987
No.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.324
Anyone in the family
have any kind of mental illness?

07:42.004 --> 07:43.005
Come on.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.684
- I'll just leave it here.
- Thanks.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.377
How's Dad?

08:23.462 --> 08:24.463
He's fine.

08:24.463 --> 08:27.216
I heard he's been putting
his rants on Facebook again?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.051
He's not.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.638
Have you decided what color

08:32.638 --> 08:34.348
you're gonna
paint the walls yet?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.141
What do you think?

08:37.267 --> 08:38.435
I found...

08:40.145 --> 08:42.814
There's a sort of a... duck egg?

08:43.732 --> 08:45.067
- Not sure.
- That's nice.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.235
Yeah.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.528
That'd be nice
in the living room, I think.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.616
Matches your trousers.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.414
Oh.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.209
Look what I found.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.961
The RSPB is hiring.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.379
For summer jobs.
They're looking for--

09:05.379 --> 09:07.631
I have a life
that I have to get back to.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.260
I know, of course.
And I'll pray for you.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.970
Mum. Don't do that.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.805
Of course I do.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.519
Rona, do you want some tea?

09:20.519 --> 09:21.937
I'll be down in a bit.

09:22.980 --> 09:23.981
Okay.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.951
I'm really bored.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.706
Are you bored too?

09:40.706 --> 09:42.874
I see what you're trying to do,
you know.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.546
Come on, this is almost done.

09:47.546 --> 09:50.382
Trust me, if you can't handle
your book on mushrooms

09:50.382 --> 09:51.633
or whatever that is...

09:53.343 --> 09:54.428
Was it mushrooms?

09:55.012 --> 09:56.346
Fungi.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.891
No, I hate the way
you barely need to read a book.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.269
And all the facts still
somehow get into your head.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.688
That's 'cause you've been
staring at it for hours.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.565
Yeah, I've been literally
staring at this page--

10:06.565 --> 10:09.026
I know, just leave it
and let's go to the pub!

10:13.739 --> 10:15.324
What was it like
growing up here?

10:15.324 --> 10:17.409
Growing up in London?
Yeah.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.328
Growing up in London
is just...

10:19.328 --> 10:21.955
there is always
low key something.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.499
I didn't actually
really clock it

10:24.499 --> 10:27.419
until the first time
I went to the countryside.

10:27.419 --> 10:31.048
And everything there
was, like, so quiet.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.272
I'm just going
to get another one,

10:47.272 --> 10:48.899
- is that all right?
- No problem.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.391
- Er, excuse me.
- Yeah, sorry?

11:22.391 --> 11:23.392
You don't have a lighter,
do you?

11:23.392 --> 11:25.560
I don't. Sorry.
I'm not a smoker myself.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.312
Right. That's very sensible.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.356
I like your hat you've got on,
by the way.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.316
- Well, thank you.
- Very interesting.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.484
Do I recognize you?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.904
- Possibly, are you from here?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.155
Oh, I was thinking
from your accent

11:37.155 --> 11:38.615
you must be from somewhere else.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.492
No, er, my mum and dad
are English.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.786
- So I got a weird accent.
- That'll be it, that'll be it.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.371
Yeah, I've actually...
I've been away

11:44.371 --> 11:47.541
- for about ten years now. So...
- My God, long time.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.127
Yeah, I don't really come back
that often.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.461
So what are you doing now, then?

11:51.461 --> 11:53.547
I'm just going off to meet
a couple of friends.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.464
Ah, friends.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.258
Yeah.

11:56.258 --> 11:59.177
Yeah, I don't really know
anyone here anymore, so...

11:59.177 --> 12:01.471
I was a bit desperate to...

12:01.471 --> 12:03.765
see if there's anyone younger
hanging around.

12:03.765 --> 12:04.724
Oh, yes.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.935
Do you wanna have a cup of tea
before you go, maybe?

12:06.935 --> 12:09.271
No, I really can't.
I've got to catch up.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.148
- Another time, maybe.
- Right.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.608
Yeah. I'm staying
with my mum at the minute.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.819
But I usually live
down in London.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.822
I just came to help my dad
with the lambing, so...

12:18.822 --> 12:20.824
But I'm going
back down there soon, so...

12:21.825 --> 12:24.619
Mm. Er, could you
just give me your hand,

12:24.619 --> 12:25.912
so I can try this again?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.956
- Oh, yeah, no problem.
- All right, thanks.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.463
- The wind.
-  Yeah, it's not easy.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.924
- Got it!
- Yeah, all right.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.801
Okay, I gotta go on.
See you later.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.011
All right.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.086
<i>Sometimes you can feel
a vibration in Orkney.</i>

14:39.462 --> 14:40.755
<i>A low rumble.</i>

14:41.464 --> 14:42.632
<i>A tremor.</i>

14:43.592 --> 14:47.804
<i>It takes over the whole island
and every part of your body.</i>

14:49.097 --> 14:50.724
<i>But, of course...</i>

14:51.891 --> 14:53.560
<i>it could all just be
in your head.</i>

14:56.938 --> 14:58.398
<i>Some people say it's the sound</i>

14:58.398 --> 15:00.609
<i>of underwater
military experiments.</i>

15:05.905 --> 15:07.115
<i>Others say it's the waves</i>

15:07.115 --> 15:09.367
<i>caught in caves
deep below the land.</i>

15:13.204 --> 15:16.041
<i>But the one that brought me
nightmares when I was little</i>

15:16.625 --> 15:18.084
<i>is the oldest theory.</i>

15:19.169 --> 15:20.503
<i>A ginormous monster</i>

15:20.503 --> 15:22.589
<i>called the Mester Muckle
Stoorworm,</i>

15:22.589 --> 15:24.424
<i>who was so big</i>

15:24.424 --> 15:26.760
<i>his tail would wrap around
the whole world.</i>

15:27.510 --> 15:28.511
<i>And he was defeated</i>

15:28.511 --> 15:31.473
<i>by a young lad
called Assipattle.</i>

15:33.016 --> 15:35.852
<i>He killed the Stoorworm
with a burning peat.</i>

15:36.519 --> 15:39.189
<i>Fire burned inside its body.</i>

15:39.189 --> 15:40.649
<i>And it was in such pain</i>

15:40.649 --> 15:43.985
<i>that its neck reached
nine times to the moon and back.</i>

15:43.985 --> 15:45.820
<i>And then its teeth fell out</i>

15:46.404 --> 15:48.281
<i>and formed the Orkney islands.</i>

15:49.366 --> 15:51.660
<i>The liver
is still burning today.</i>

15:52.911 --> 15:55.038
<i>And we feel that as the tremors.</i>

16:06.091 --> 16:07.759
Oh, that was just lovely.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.678
Absolutely gorgeous.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.513
More mince,
if anyone wants another.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.056
- Couldn't have any more.
- No, thanks.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.141
Rona,
I notice you haven't eaten much.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.309
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.687
I'm just not hungry,
but it was lovely. Yeah.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.523
Excuse me.
Bless you.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.441
I'd just like to say thank you.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.236
Thank you, Father,
for this delicious food

16:26.236 --> 16:29.572
and for this wonderful company
at my table today.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.368
Of course we thank you,
Lord, for the food on our table,

16:33.368 --> 16:34.661
for the sun in the sky...

16:42.961 --> 16:44.504
<i>So are you up for long?</i>

16:44.504 --> 16:46.965
<i>No, I'm going back down
to London next week.</i>

16:46.965 --> 16:49.426
Just because, um,
there's a service for healing

16:49.426 --> 16:50.677
on a Thursday evening.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.429
You might find it interesting.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.264
Your husband used to go, right?

16:54.264 --> 16:56.182
Yeah, my Mark went,
like, last year.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.351
He was having
a bit of trouble with drinking

16:58.351 --> 16:59.978
and just needed
a bit of guidance

16:59.978 --> 17:01.980
and, you know,
just a bit of support and that.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.690
A bit of help, really,
you know, so...

17:03.690 --> 17:05.108
No, I'm doing fine, so...

17:05.108 --> 17:07.152
I mean, anyone can go.
It's not really like...

17:07.152 --> 17:08.611
Rona, your mum was saying

17:08.611 --> 17:10.613
that you're taking a break
from your study?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.042
Rona. Please don't.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.253
Don't what? Don't what? This?

17:26.421 --> 17:28.131
I'm sober. Do they know that?

17:28.923 --> 17:31.468
Because they seem to know
everything else, don't they?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.514
You've clearly told them
everything that's going on.

17:37.515 --> 17:38.767
Rona, I'm sorry.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.021
Come back inside?

17:43.021 --> 17:44.564
Give me a minute.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.903
Mm. Don't start reading
the Bible without me.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.622
<i>We want to see, we want to see</i>

18:01.372 --> 18:04.793
<i>We want to see Jesus lifted high</i>

18:04.793 --> 18:07.879
<i>We want to see, we want to see</i>

18:07.879 --> 18:09.047
<i>We want to see...</i>

18:22.644 --> 18:25.313
<i>Get a shift on, Daynin.
Come on.</i>

18:30.401 --> 18:31.903
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

18:33.738 --> 18:35.949
-Daynin. Rona.
- Daynin.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.200
<i>Give me your hand!</i>

18:37.200 --> 18:38.368
Ah, give me your hand!

18:38.368 --> 18:40.995
Please, don't.
Two hands on the bicycle!

18:41.830 --> 18:45.875
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

18:47.460 --> 18:49.170
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

18:49.170 --> 18:50.380
Sorry!

18:50.380 --> 18:53.967
<i>Dear Gloria</i>

18:53.967 --> 18:57.637
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

19:58.990 --> 19:59.991
Hi.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.327
Hi.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.232
<i>Sometimes
when I hallucinate,</i>

20:34.067 --> 20:36.611
<i>I transpose
the island's boundaries</i>

20:36.611 --> 20:38.321
<i>onto a map of London.</i>

20:39.530 --> 20:41.908
<i>In Hackney, thousands of people</i>

20:41.908 --> 20:43.701
<i>live in the same area</i>

20:43.701 --> 20:46.621
<i>of the farm that was home
to just our family.</i>

20:47.747 --> 20:49.457
<i>150 acres.</i>

20:52.710 --> 20:56.297
<i>Screaming gulls are sirens,
the sea, traffic.</i>

20:57.090 --> 20:59.258
<i>Tower blocks are cliff faces.</i>

21:00.093 --> 21:02.512
<i>The warning lights
on top of tall buildings</i>

21:02.512 --> 21:03.805
<i>are lighthouses.</i>

21:05.014 --> 21:07.475
<i>The Tower of London
is Skara Brae.</i>

21:07.475 --> 21:10.770
<i>And the Millennium Dome
is the ancient Ring of Brodgar.</i>

21:49.434 --> 21:51.644
Rona, I just wanted
a quick catch up really,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.980
- just to see how you are.
-Yeah, good. Why?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.106
No, it's just that we had

21:55.106 --> 21:56.816
the lab meeting last week
and you weren't there.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.151
Everyone else was there.

21:58.151 --> 22:01.112
Well, yeah, I had, erm,
a dentist appointment that day.

22:01.112 --> 22:04.115
But also, I've just been
really busy with the project.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.450
You could've told me
about the dentist.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.993
I mean, some of the other guys
in the lab,

22:06.993 --> 22:08.745
they said that you sort of
distanced yourself a little bit.

22:08.745 --> 22:09.871
I did. Erm...

22:09.871 --> 22:11.581
That you're not going
to coffee with them

22:11.581 --> 22:13.291
- as much as you used to.
- Sorry. Erm...

22:17.462 --> 22:19.714
I mean, you had promised
to get a report to me

22:19.714 --> 22:21.299
last week as well.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.608
Have you ever felt like
you could control the weather?

23:21.609 --> 23:22.610
Really?

23:24.529 --> 23:25.905
Nah, that's not me.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.950
God, you're weird.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.414
You all right?

23:36.290 --> 23:37.333
Mm-hmm.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.169
Sure?

23:53.558 --> 23:54.934
I used to think

23:54.934 --> 23:58.437
my dad could control the wind,
when I was little.

24:02.942 --> 24:03.943
Dad!

24:07.905 --> 24:09.448
- Dad?
- Yeah.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.741
There you are.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.368
Hiya.

24:13.536 --> 24:14.996
- Hi.
- You all right?

24:14.996 --> 24:16.122
Yeah.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.457
I'm heading off soon,
so I wanted to say goodbye.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.750
- Are you?
- Yeah.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.502
- Already?
- Mm.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.296
Well, you want to see
a lump of something,

24:23.296 --> 24:25.548
- might be worth a fortune?
- What?

24:26.299 --> 24:28.050
"One test for ambergris
is to poke it

24:28.050 --> 24:30.386
with a hot needle
and a liquid should ooze out."

24:30.386 --> 24:31.804
Here we go.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.685
Look, look, look, look.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.395
That's liquid. Oh, my God!

24:39.395 --> 24:40.646
Wow.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.774
"Ambergris is a rare
and highly valuable substance

24:43.774 --> 24:45.735
produced in the stomach
of sperm whales,

24:45.735 --> 24:48.946
either vomited or excreted
and found floating on the seas.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.532
It has a bad smell."
Does it have a bad smell?

24:51.532 --> 24:52.950
Doesn't smell like anything.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.535
Still, that is liquid.

24:54.535 --> 24:58.456
- It says for one gram...
- Yes.

24:58.456 --> 25:00.333
...you can get $28.

25:00.333 --> 25:03.252
- What's that, 25 quid? 23 quid?
- Like 25 quid.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.546
Twenty-three, so that's,
that's... this is...

25:05.546 --> 25:07.924
This is ten pounds.
That's four and a half kilos,

25:07.924 --> 25:10.676
that's 4,500, that's... 25...

25:10.676 --> 25:12.803
That's over 100,000 pounds.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.432
That's over 100...

25:18.142 --> 25:18.976
Well done!

25:18.976 --> 25:20.353
That is one big tractor.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.313
- Seriously?
- My God.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.815
Oh, my.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.817
Will you send me updates
when you hear?

25:26.817 --> 25:28.653
- Well now, why don't you stay?
- No, I can't.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.238
Tell you what
I could do help with.

25:30.238 --> 25:31.989
A couple of the dikes
have come down

25:31.989 --> 25:34.116
on the outrun there,
and I could use some help

25:34.116 --> 25:35.409
building them back up again.

25:35.409 --> 25:37.370
No, I've really been here
for long enough.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.580
- London is calling me.
- All right.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.790
I got to go back.

25:44.001 --> 25:46.796
So, because
you're gonna be rolling in it,

25:46.796 --> 25:48.714
do you think maybe
you could lend me a few quids

25:48.714 --> 25:50.299
just to tide me over
for when I go back?

25:50.299 --> 25:52.301
- I just can't.
- Right. That's okay.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.844
Have you asked your mum?

25:53.844 --> 25:57.932
Erm, she offered to put me
into her prayers.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.280
<i>You will see
passenger emergency</i>

26:12.280 --> 26:14.907
<i>instruction notices
in various parts of the vessel</i>

26:14.907 --> 26:17.118
<i>and in the passenger cabins.</i>

26:17.118 --> 26:18.828
<i>Please study these carefully...</i>

26:28.462 --> 26:31.257
<i>Located in
the following positions,</i>

<i>in the restaurant...</i>

27:07.918 --> 27:10.713
<i>The urge to drink

27:14.091 --> 27:15.885
<i>You think you're doing well.</i>

27:15.885 --> 27:18.763
<i>But suddenly you want
nothing more than a drink.</i>

27:23.142 --> 27:24.602
<i>When people drink,</i>

27:24.602 --> 27:27.813
<i>alcohol,
or more specifically ethanol,</i>

27:27.813 --> 27:29.899
<i>is absorbed
into the stomach lining</i>

27:29.899 --> 27:31.734
<i>and enters the blood stream.</i>

27:33.027 --> 27:34.070
<i>In the brain,</i>

27:34.070 --> 27:37.990
<i>alcohol confuses messages
between neurotransmitters</i>

27:37.990 --> 27:41.202
<i>and acts as both
an intoxicant and a depressant</i>

27:41.202 --> 27:42.661
<i>or a relaxant.</i>

27:49.460 --> 27:50.461
Hiya.

27:51.545 --> 27:52.546
Hey.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.259
- You all right?
-Yeah.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.887
That's good.
Just going to the loo.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.466
<i>For those of us
susceptible to addiction,</i>

28:37.466 --> 28:39.135
<i>alcohol quickly becomes</i>

28:39.135 --> 28:41.720
<i>the default way
of alleviating anxiety</i>

28:41.720 --> 28:44.807
<i>and dealing with
stressful situations.</i>

28:47.351 --> 28:49.311
<i>Through repeated use

28:49.311 --> 28:52.648
<i>our neural pathways

28:52.648 --> 28:54.650
<i>they'll never be repaired.</i>

29:23.929 --> 29:25.473
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

29:28.392 --> 29:29.768
-Hi, Elena.
- Hello.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.103
It's good see you back.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.063
Elena, this is Rona.
Rona, Elena.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.190
Nice to meet you.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.691
Rona has a training day with us.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.569
Elena quite often works for us
at the RSPB on the island.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.237
Manages our cottage here
on Papay.

29:40.237 --> 29:41.739
Yes.

29:41.739 --> 29:43.324
So you gonna take us
to the holm?

29:43.324 --> 29:44.617
Yeah, that's right.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.410
The tides look perfect
for going there just now.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.037
Boat's ready in the water.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.581
The first time
that you visited Orkney?

29:50.581 --> 29:52.625
Oh, I'm from West Mainland.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.543
Ah! Very nice.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.920
We can just maybe,
like, spend

29:55.920 --> 29:58.464
about an hour and a half there,
if that's okay with you?

29:58.464 --> 29:59.381
Great.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.799
We'll get you
back to Papay.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.135
Oh, Papay really
is my favorite island.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.970
Don't you want to stay
for a cuppa

30:04.970 --> 30:06.472
or a coffee at Rose Cottage?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.481
So that's a grey seal,
on the rocks.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.398
Yeah.

30:16.398 --> 30:18.400
The grey seal pups,
they're all fluffy and white.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.444
They're really nice.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.404
And they can't swim right away.

30:22.947 --> 30:26.492
But the common seals,
they can swim almost right away.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.411
They can just get into the water
the same day.

30:41.966 --> 30:43.926
People really like them.
And folk here,

30:43.926 --> 30:46.720
what they really like
is the sound they make.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.556
Woo!

30:48.556 --> 30:50.641
Woo!

30:50.641 --> 30:52.685
Yeah, nice one. Can you do it?

30:52.685 --> 30:54.979
Woo!

30:54.979 --> 30:57.147
A bit like a wolf.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.984
Quite eerie,
especially if it's at night.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.365
Hi.

31:28.762 --> 31:33.642
<i>Homo sapiens have about 79%
of the same DNA as seals.</i>

31:34.977 --> 31:39.315
<i>50% as plants,
a banana, a cucumber</i>

31:39.315 --> 31:40.774
<i>or seaweed.</i>

31:43.027 --> 31:44.945
<i>60% as jellyfish.</i>

31:48.449 --> 31:52.703
<i>Jellyfish are only capable
of upwards independent movements</i>

31:52.703 --> 31:55.873
<i>so they're moved horizontally
by currents and tides.</i>

32:03.505 --> 32:04.506
Wait!

32:05.299 --> 32:08.218
<i>The day I was born,
my father became unwell.</i>

32:08.761 --> 32:11.680
<i>One of the bipolar episodes
he'd had periodically</i>

32:11.680 --> 32:13.432
<i>since he was a teenager.</i>

32:13.432 --> 32:16.226
Wee!

32:30.866 --> 32:32.660
<i>If you go mad in Orkney...</i>

32:33.744 --> 32:35.079
<i>they just fly you out.</i>

32:51.595 --> 32:53.722
So, what you've got
in front of you here

32:53.722 --> 32:56.975
is what I would say
is a really well-mowed field.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.353
Okay? And so what he's done

32:59.353 --> 33:03.440
is he's gone from the inside
and he's mowed all the way out.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.900
So that any corncrakes

33:04.900 --> 33:07.194
that might have been
on his land in the field,

33:07.194 --> 33:10.197
they can come all the way
into the long grass.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.115
Mm-hmm.

33:11.115 --> 33:13.033
Okay,
so when it comes to the survey,

33:13.033 --> 33:14.827
you'll have one of these
in front of you,

33:14.827 --> 33:17.162
- and it's like a grid system.
- Mm-hmm.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.290
So you start here
from 12:00 to 3:00 a.m.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.793
<i>And then you go
every 200 to 500 meters...</i>

33:23.502 --> 33:25.546
<i>and then you stop.</i>

33:27.923 --> 33:29.216
<i>You wind down your window,</i>

33:30.008 --> 33:32.428
<i>set a timer on your phone
for two minutes,</i>

33:33.554 --> 33:34.555
<i>and you listen.</i>

33:37.641 --> 33:38.892
For what?

33:38.892 --> 33:41.103
For the sound of a corncrake.
Have you heard a corncrake?

33:41.103 --> 33:42.813
- No.
- Right. Well...

33:42.813 --> 33:44.273
How would you describe it?

33:44.273 --> 33:46.150
I'd say it's quite like, erm...

33:48.193 --> 33:50.529
...maybe like a cat hissing
or something.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.532
I would say more like a cranking
chair, more something like...

33:55.242 --> 33:56.952
- Right.
- That's good, that's good.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.954
Get it up on YouTube for her.

34:01.165 --> 34:03.333
Uh-huh.

34:43.332 --> 34:46.794
So, can you tell me
why you're here, Rona?

34:46.794 --> 34:51.173
Yeah. I'm here for a referral,
for rehab.

34:51.173 --> 34:52.633
Erm, residential.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.345
I just want you to lock me up.

34:57.554 --> 35:00.766
Okay. Well, there can be
quite a rate sometimes

35:00.766 --> 35:02.601
for residential places.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.603
But there are
some other options.

35:12.820 --> 35:15.697
<i>This program
is a zero-tolerance</i>

35:15.697 --> 35:17.991
<i>abstinence-based program.</i>

35:17.991 --> 35:21.453
Which means that if you
don't turn up, for any reason,

35:21.453 --> 35:23.080
you are off the program.

35:23.831 --> 35:27.543
It means if you relapse,
you are off the program.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.045
What is said in this group,

35:30.045 --> 35:32.923
stays within
the walls of this group.

35:32.923 --> 35:34.007
No phones.

35:34.007 --> 35:37.553
I would ask that you only
check them at your break times.

35:37.553 --> 35:40.806
Also, all fag
and bathroom breaks

35:40.806 --> 35:43.809
will be accompanied
by a counselor.

35:44.893 --> 35:48.939
<i>Statistically, only 10%
of you will make this.</i>

35:48.939 --> 35:50.607
<i>I know that sounds tough.</i>

35:50.607 --> 35:53.485
<i>But it is a tough journey
that you have started.</i>

36:09.918 --> 36:11.962
Rona, come on.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.298
No, Mum, I'm okay, thanks.

36:14.298 --> 36:16.383
Come on, Rona,
it's lovely.

36:16.383 --> 36:17.467
I'm fine.

36:23.891 --> 36:24.975
How's Mum?

36:24.975 --> 36:27.895
You could always just call her
and ask her yourself.

36:35.903 --> 36:37.070
How's the job?

36:38.113 --> 36:39.531
Erm...

36:39.531 --> 36:41.867
Well, I haven't heard
a corncrake yet.

36:43.577 --> 36:44.661
So not that great.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.041
No, I can't do that.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.670
I did find out that
there's a large population

36:53.670 --> 36:55.172
of corncakes in Eastern Europe.

36:55.797 --> 36:58.592
By the way, it's not ambergris.
I got the results back.

36:59.468 --> 37:00.427
Oh.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.972
- What is it then?
- Paraffin wax or something.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.057
Probably.

37:05.641 --> 37:06.683
Hmm.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.772
Thanks for staying longer.

37:25.661 --> 37:26.787
Hey, Dad.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.501
I made another flower picture.

37:37.881 --> 37:40.509
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

37:40.509 --> 37:43.971
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

38:08.996 --> 38:10.664
<i>The past follows us.</i>

38:12.082 --> 38:14.209
<i>Energy never expires.</i>

38:23.301 --> 38:26.304
<i>The energy of waves
carried across the ocean</i>

38:26.304 --> 38:29.474
<i>changes into noise
and heat and vibrations</i>

38:29.474 --> 38:32.144
<i>that are absorbed into the land</i>

38:32.144 --> 38:34.354
<i>and passed through
the generations.</i>

38:35.939 --> 38:37.858
<i>Waves break when the wave height</i>

38:37.858 --> 38:40.694
<i>is more than one seventh
of the wave length.</i>

38:42.320 --> 38:44.865
<i>Although they collapse
in different manners,</i>

38:44.865 --> 38:48.243
<i>there is only so much height
any wave can sustain</i>

38:48.994 --> 38:50.912
<i>before it comes crashing down.</i>

42:12.864 --> 42:14.950
I'm so proud of you!

42:14.950 --> 42:16.284
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.870
- Really?
- Yeah, you're doing so well.

42:25.252 --> 42:26.962
Go on, go on, go on!
Grab a shot!

42:28.964 --> 42:30.340
-Cheers, guys!
- Okay.

42:30.340 --> 42:31.508
Make a speech!

42:31.508 --> 42:33.426
- Don't make me make a speech.
- Come on!

42:33.426 --> 42:35.011
- Speech! Speech!
- Come on!

42:35.011 --> 42:36.596
Okay, you think
it's about me, yeah?

42:36.596 --> 42:39.140
But I wouldn't have been able
to do it without all of you lot.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.558
He's so humble.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.061
- Cheers.
- Go on, go on, go on!

42:49.192 --> 42:52.487
Yes, yes, yes, yeah!

42:53.738 --> 42:55.615
Would you want to marry me?

42:55.615 --> 42:58.243
Do I want to marry you?

42:58.702 --> 43:00.704
Do you think
you'd want to marry me?

43:00.704 --> 43:02.414
- Oh.
- One day, maybe.

43:02.414 --> 43:04.291
- Maybe?
- Maybe...

43:04.291 --> 43:06.501
One, two, three, four.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.589
Hey! Hey, hey...

43:14.467 --> 43:15.927
For fuck's sake.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.304
- Babe.
-Ow.

43:17.846 --> 43:18.847
You okay?

43:18.847 --> 43:20.682
You all right, love?

43:21.599 --> 43:23.184
- All right, honey?
-Rona, babe?

43:23.184 --> 43:25.145
Where's my compass?
Oh...

43:25.145 --> 43:27.605
Did you definitely
bring it out with you?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.774
Did you just have it on
whilst you were dancing?

43:29.774 --> 43:32.110
- No, don't worry, don't worry...
- It's okay. We'll find it.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.070
-  My compass.
- Maybe it just came off.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.989
Have you seen...
She misses the...

43:35.989 --> 43:38.867
- It's like this necklace thing.
- Not a necklace, it's a compass.

43:38.867 --> 43:41.536
-Sorry, her compass.
- Sorry, but I didn't take it.

43:41.536 --> 43:43.204
I don't know where it's gone.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.749
My dad gave me that compass.

43:45.749 --> 43:47.500
Okay, okay, okay...

43:47.500 --> 43:49.002
What are you laughing at?

43:49.002 --> 43:51.087
- What are you laughing at?
- No one's laughing.

43:51.087 --> 43:52.672
You think you're great
because you earn

43:52.672 --> 43:54.591
more money than I do,
is that it?

43:54.591 --> 43:56.259
You're not laughing now,
are you?

43:56.259 --> 43:57.969
- Would you keep it...
- No one's laughing at you.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.971
Rona! Get a grip!

44:00.472 --> 44:02.140
Fuck! Fuck!

44:02.140 --> 44:04.142
What the fuck was that?

44:06.478 --> 44:09.189
Okay. Okay, babe,
we need to go outside.

44:09.189 --> 44:10.607
Rona?

44:10.607 --> 44:13.610
Rona, listen to me.
Just breathe.

44:13.610 --> 44:16.905
Just breathe, it's okay.
You're okay.

44:18.031 --> 44:20.533
You're okay. Just deep breaths.
You're fine, okay?

44:20.533 --> 44:21.910
Just breathe.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.246
Please don't.

44:25.246 --> 44:27.749
Rona, you're hurting yourself.

44:27.749 --> 44:28.792
Has she taken something?

44:28.792 --> 44:30.001
No, I've not
given her anything.

44:30.001 --> 44:31.086
Get off.

44:31.086 --> 44:32.545
-Just listen to me.
- Get off.

44:32.796 --> 44:33.630
Double vodka.

44:33.630 --> 44:35.590
You can't order
another drink.

44:35.590 --> 44:37.717
- We're goin'-- Oi!
-Chill out.

44:37.717 --> 44:40.011
Go upstairs, please.
I'm too tired for this!

44:40.887 --> 44:42.722
We're going home, all right?

44:42.722 --> 44:44.891
No! You can't have that. Rona!

44:44.891 --> 44:46.851
For fuck's sake, Rona!

44:46.851 --> 44:48.603
Be careful, hey!

44:51.648 --> 44:53.191
- Can you just listen?
- Get off!

44:53.191 --> 44:56.528
No, no! Would you just
listen to me? I'm begging you.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.071
-No!
- Get away from me!

44:58.071 --> 45:00.198
Where are you going?
You're not going anywhere!

45:00.198 --> 45:02.450
Listen to me!
You have a problem!

45:02.450 --> 45:06.121
No, you're trying to control me.

45:06.121 --> 45:08.081
I'm not trying
to fucking control you.

45:08.081 --> 45:10.083
This has nothing to do with me.

45:10.083 --> 45:14.129
- This is about you.
-  I hate you.

45:35.775 --> 45:36.776
Morning.

46:10.059 --> 46:11.978
What did I do last night?

46:11.978 --> 46:13.313
You don't remember?

46:22.697 --> 46:24.032
Daynin, I'm sorry.

46:31.206 --> 46:34.083
Daynin, I'm so sorry,
whatever I did.

46:36.211 --> 46:38.505
I'm not drinking anymore.
I'm sorry.

46:39.839 --> 46:42.217
And I'm so tired
of hearing you say that.

46:44.219 --> 46:46.221
I can't hear you say that again.

46:50.058 --> 46:51.142
What do you mean?

46:51.142 --> 46:53.353
I don't even
recognize you anymore.

46:56.105 --> 46:58.358
I wish you were
a completely different person.

46:58.358 --> 47:01.402
- Don't say that.
- I can't do this.

47:01.402 --> 47:03.571
What do you mean
you can't do this?

47:03.571 --> 47:04.948
I just can't do this.

47:06.241 --> 47:07.909
Did I do that to you?

47:12.288 --> 47:14.207
I'll never do that again. Right?

47:15.416 --> 47:17.669
Whatever I did,
I'll never do it again.

47:17.669 --> 47:20.755
I'm never going to drink again.
I promise you. Right?

47:20.755 --> 47:23.675
'Cause I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you.

47:23.675 --> 47:25.260
Please don't go.

47:30.682 --> 47:31.683
I love you.

47:33.142 --> 47:36.271
God,
grant me the serenity

47:36.271 --> 47:39.774
to accept the things
that I cannot change,

47:39.774 --> 47:42.694
the courage to change
the things that I can,

47:42.694 --> 47:45.321
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

47:47.574 --> 47:48.950
Thank you, Steven.

47:51.619 --> 47:55.748
Rona, would you be happy
to share with the group today?

47:58.668 --> 48:02.714
Perhaps some of the feelings
that you experience

48:02.714 --> 48:04.882
when you think about drinking.

48:07.719 --> 48:08.886
Mm-hmm.

48:14.684 --> 48:15.727
Erm...

48:25.486 --> 48:26.487
I miss it.

48:33.870 --> 48:36.247
I miss how good it made me feel.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.093
I fell in the canal.

48:49.969 --> 48:51.554
And I broke the bike.

48:51.554 --> 48:53.306
But I'm gonna sort it out.

48:57.060 --> 48:58.686
Are you gonna not say anything?

48:58.686 --> 49:00.938
What do you want me
to say, Rona?

49:00.938 --> 49:03.441
You're always judging me.
You're being so hard on me.

49:03.441 --> 49:05.443
I made a mistake.
I'm sick of it.

49:05.443 --> 49:07.153
I'm honestly... I'm sick of you.

49:08.154 --> 49:11.407
I feel like you want me
to become one of those women

49:11.407 --> 49:13.576
that just caters to you
and then,

49:13.576 --> 49:15.161
with a big smile on my face
and like...

49:15.161 --> 49:16.621
That's not the way I am.

49:16.621 --> 49:19.499
That's not the way I'm ever
gonna be. I'm not like that.

49:19.499 --> 49:21.042
And you know that.

49:21.042 --> 49:22.960
I don't know why
you're expecting that from me.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.672
You're trying to tame me.
And you're trying to control me.

49:33.137 --> 49:34.806
Thank you for your honesty.

49:36.432 --> 49:38.226
Well, Rona, um...

49:38.893 --> 49:41.688
Just want to share this...
I don't know, with you.

49:41.688 --> 49:43.606
Basically, I...

49:43.606 --> 49:47.944
My ex-girlfriend found my stash
and threw it down the toilet.

49:47.944 --> 49:50.530
So I thought I'd leave her
a little gift in the bed.

49:50.530 --> 49:52.532
Which was, I just basically shat
in the bed.

49:52.532 --> 49:54.450
- Left her a little prezzie.
- Wow.

49:55.410 --> 49:57.370
It's like...
Oh, yeah. I got one.

49:57.370 --> 49:59.122
I got in at about
3 o'clock in the morning.

49:59.122 --> 50:01.499
Snuck up to bed,
got into bed. Right?

50:01.499 --> 50:03.376
Then about four or five o'clock,

50:03.376 --> 50:06.045
I get a whack.
She has booted me, right?

50:06.045 --> 50:07.630
Kicked me straight up
the arse, basically.

50:07.630 --> 50:08.798
Pulled the covers up.

50:08.798 --> 50:10.591
And I've pissed
from her neck down,

50:10.591 --> 50:12.593
right down all through
her jarmies, everything.

50:13.553 --> 50:15.513
Talking of peeing, in my days...

50:15.513 --> 50:16.806
Here we go.

50:22.770 --> 50:24.897
- Hello.
-Hi, hi.

50:24.897 --> 50:26.274
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

50:26.274 --> 50:28.359
- I'm getting on. Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

50:28.359 --> 50:30.361
Erm, yeah, I'm with the RSPB,

50:30.361 --> 50:32.780
I was just wondering if I could
have a couple of minutes

50:32.780 --> 50:33.698
- of your time.
- Yeah.

50:33.698 --> 50:36.409
We're trying to figure out
how many corncrakes

50:36.409 --> 50:39.162
are still on all of the islands
throughout Orkney.

50:39.162 --> 50:42.248
And how we can actually protect
the corncrakes

50:42.248 --> 50:44.375
- 'cause they're on the red list.
- Mm-hmm.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.377
You want to come
in for a cup of tea?

50:46.377 --> 50:47.545
Yeah, I will in a minute.

50:47.545 --> 50:48.963
I'll tell you this
really, really quickly.

50:48.963 --> 50:51.632
Basically, what we're trying
to get farmers like yourself

50:51.632 --> 50:54.343
to do is to change
their mowing pattern.

50:54.343 --> 50:56.554
Did your father sell the farm?

50:56.554 --> 50:58.556
- He sold the house.
- Ah, right. Yeah.

50:58.556 --> 50:59.849
He's still on the farm...

50:59.849 --> 51:01.684
So where the heck
does he bide then?

51:01.684 --> 51:03.853
-  He's in a caravan.
- Oh, Lord.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.272
Yeah.
It's enough for him, really.

51:06.272 --> 51:08.065
It's got all his records
and stuff.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.233
Good, good.

51:09.233 --> 51:11.944
...working my way through
the whole island and...

51:11.944 --> 51:13.738
every inhabited islands
in Orkney.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.573
-  Indeed. That's good.
- Yeah.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.618
To see how many people
we can get on board, so...

51:18.618 --> 51:21.579
I don't know if you'd be up
for doing something like that.

51:21.579 --> 51:22.997
- Absolutely okay.
- Yeah.

51:22.997 --> 51:25.374
- Yeah? Oh, really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

51:25.374 --> 51:27.126
Okay. Great.

51:28.419 --> 51:29.921
- Have you heard one?
- No.

51:29.921 --> 51:32.089
- Have you not?
- Haven't heard one.

51:32.089 --> 51:33.508
- Have you?
- You will do sometime.

51:33.508 --> 51:35.885
I've not for a long time,
which is a bit disappointing,

51:35.885 --> 51:37.595
'cause they used to be
quite common, but...

51:37.595 --> 51:38.513
Yeah.

51:38.513 --> 51:40.223
- ...things change.
- Yeah.

51:42.850 --> 51:45.561
<i>Because people rarely
saw the corncrake fly,</i>

51:45.561 --> 51:49.232
<i>it used to be thought they'd
go underground in the winter,</i>

51:49.232 --> 51:51.359
<i>transform into other species,</i>

51:51.359 --> 51:54.403
<i>or even ride on other
birds' backs to migrate.</i>

51:55.738 --> 52:00.201
<i>We now know that they do migrate
all the way to Central Africa.</i>

52:00.201 --> 52:02.245
<i>And GPS trackers
have placed them</i>

52:02.245 --> 52:03.913
<i>in Congo in the winter.</i>

52:05.206 --> 52:06.833
<i>But it's
a very dangerous journey.</i>

52:07.708 --> 52:09.418
<i>Only 30% make it.</i>

52:16.342 --> 52:17.343
Hi.

52:27.228 --> 52:28.229
Daynin.

52:29.939 --> 52:31.983
Fuck.

53:24.744 --> 53:26.621
That's it then, corncrakes.

53:38.591 --> 53:40.968
<i>So, is this
your first meeting or...</i>

53:42.470 --> 53:44.263
No. Good, okay.

53:47.892 --> 53:51.062
Well, why don't we start
with the preamble as usual.

53:53.064 --> 53:55.316
Hello. I'm James.
I'm an alcoholic.

53:55.316 --> 53:57.109
- Hi, James.
- Hello, James.

53:57.109 --> 53:58.819
So, we'll do
the preamble.

53:59.654 --> 54:02.239
Alcoholics Anonymous
is a fellowship of men and women

54:02.239 --> 54:04.617
who share their experience,
strength and hope

54:04.617 --> 54:07.536
with each other that they may
solve their common problem

54:07.536 --> 54:10.122
and help others
to recover from alcoholism.

54:10.122 --> 54:11.832
The only requirement
for membership

54:11.832 --> 54:13.751
is a desire to stop drinking.

54:13.751 --> 54:16.629
There are no dues or fees
for AA membership.

54:16.629 --> 54:19.090
Our primary purpose
is to stay sober

54:19.090 --> 54:22.510
and help other alcoholics
to achieve sobriety.

54:26.806 --> 54:29.266
God, grant me the serenity

54:29.266 --> 54:32.687
to accept the things
I cannot change,

54:32.687 --> 54:36.107
the courage to change
the things that I can,

54:36.107 --> 54:38.609
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

54:39.610 --> 54:40.611
Amen.

54:47.868 --> 54:48.869
Meg?

54:52.999 --> 54:54.000
Dad.

55:08.055 --> 55:09.807
I can't find Meg anywhere.

55:17.148 --> 55:19.692
I'm just gonna leave some water
for her and some food.

55:19.692 --> 55:23.112
But you've got to remember
to do that, okay?

55:25.489 --> 55:27.366
And I'll ask Mum
to get someone in

55:27.366 --> 55:28.826
to just help you with the farm.

55:28.826 --> 55:30.119
Just until you feel better.

55:48.596 --> 55:49.597
You warm enough?

56:14.497 --> 56:15.498
I'm scared.

56:36.143 --> 56:38.062
I don't know
if I can do it, Dad.

56:45.861 --> 56:47.530
<i>I wish you
a very happy future.</i>

56:47.530 --> 56:48.864
You deserve it.

56:50.324 --> 56:52.660
Rona,
it's been a fantastic journey

56:52.660 --> 56:53.911
being with you here.

56:53.911 --> 56:55.871
I wish we had met elsewhere.

56:55.871 --> 56:58.290
But I think
we've come a very long way.

56:58.290 --> 57:00.167
And congratulation.

57:03.879 --> 57:06.382
Well done, Rona.
All the best to you.

57:08.175 --> 57:09.260
Er...

57:12.346 --> 57:14.056
Thanks for making me strong.

57:18.602 --> 57:21.147
I hope I don't let you down.

57:26.152 --> 57:27.736
Mum, are you there?

57:28.320 --> 57:29.155
Er...

57:29.738 --> 57:32.449
I finished, I did it, 90 days.

57:35.369 --> 57:36.370
Yeah.

57:40.374 --> 57:41.375
Yeah.

57:46.380 --> 57:48.674
Thanks, Mum. Erm...

57:51.552 --> 57:53.512
Can I come up home
for a few days?

58:32.301 --> 58:34.094
<i>Hey,
you've reached Daynin.</i>

58:34.094 --> 58:35.888
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

58:35.888 --> 58:38.140
Daynin.

58:39.558 --> 58:40.893
It's me.

58:45.231 --> 58:47.441
Don't know
if you'll get this message.

58:57.826 --> 58:59.036
I miss you.

59:01.080 --> 59:03.457
I miss talking to you.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.425
I know why you left me.

59:20.349 --> 59:21.684
I get it.

59:26.772 --> 59:28.315
I get it.

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:30.169
- Cheers.
- Cheers again.

01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:31.628
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

01:00:39.178 --> 01:00:41.138
This is a great moment.
We're all together.

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:04.161
Where are the apples?

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:06.288
Where are the apples?

01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:10.751
The apples...
Oh, shit.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.755
I was just getting an apple.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:31.021
He's not real, you know.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.773
They have you brainwashed.

01:01:34.066 --> 01:01:35.192
Come to bed, Rona.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.362
That's why Dad left you,
you know.

01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:41.573
Because you chose them over us.

01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:45.452
I can't believe that
you still believe...

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:46.870
You're so stupid.

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:49.540
There's another one.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.624
Lies.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.105
All that praying didn't help,
did it, Mum?

01:02:14.273 --> 01:02:16.275
It didn't help me.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.908
- Go on, lie down.
- Didn't help me.

01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:27.035
Come on.

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:32.541
Come on.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:35.836
I'm sorry, Mum.

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.969
I'm sorry, Mummy.

01:03:43.237 --> 01:03:47.074
Washing machine, cooker,
pots and pans, and the stove.

01:03:47.074 --> 01:03:49.284
Watch the handle
for it can get hot.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.871
Erm, there's firewood there
and there's more in the shed.

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.915
- Okay.
- But when it gets really cold,

01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:57.501
you might want to order
a bag of coal from the shop.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:00.003
It's pretty rough
in the winter time.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:03.715
Er, no fancy going somewhere
warmer like the Canary Islands

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.259
- or somewhere like that?
- Yeah,

01:04:05.259 --> 01:04:06.843
it's cheaper to come to Papay.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.012
Well, that is very true.

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:12.599
Er, this is your bedroom,
living room.

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:16.061
It still smells a bit fusty.
Erm...

01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:19.273
But there's the bed.
It's quite cozy.

01:04:19.273 --> 01:04:21.525
And, well,
we meet on a Wednesday

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:23.944
in the hall, if you fancy
a cup of tea and a blether.

01:04:23.944 --> 01:04:26.863
We're just 60 people
but there's plenty going on.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.448
If you're wanting
a bit of company?

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:30.325
- Yeah, I might do, yeah. Maybe.
- Okay.

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.911
I'll away. I've got stuff to do,
and I'll see you soon.

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:34.913
- Have you got the keys?
- Oh. Sorry.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:37.332
- It's all right.
- Not that we need them.

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:39.001
- Thanks, Elena.
- Not in Papay.

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:40.252
You take care, Rona.

01:04:40.252 --> 01:04:42.129
- Bye.
- Cheerio.

01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:12.659
<i>Britain is an island
off Europe.</i>

01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:16.371
<i>Orkney is an island
off Scotland.</i>

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:20.250
<i>Westray is an island off Orkney.</i>

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:25.339
<i>Papay is an island off Westray.</i>

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.387
<i>According to Orcadian folklore,</i>

01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:36.725
<i>the island Hether Blether
only appears in the fog.</i>

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:43.023
<i>It was said that once a girl
was kidnapped by a finman</i>

01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:45.067
<i>and taken
to the mystical island,</i>

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:47.611
<i>and never could return.</i>

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.116
Hi, Mum, it's me.

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:56.328
Erm, sorry I didn't
get to see you

01:05:56.328 --> 01:05:58.622
before I went to the airport.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:03.001
I just wanted to let you know
that I got to Papay safely.

01:06:04.753 --> 01:06:07.589
Erm...

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:12.928
<i>I don't know yet how long
I'm going to stay.</i>

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.138
<i>A couple of months, I think.</i>

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:18.183
<i>The signal is not great here,</i>

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:20.686
<i>but it would be good
to hear from you.</i>

01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:19.411
Whoo-hoo!

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:21.705
Yes!

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:24.458
And I see mornings
with high heating bills.

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:26.251
And with every crumb

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:28.837
that fell from your lips
onto fresh bed linen sheets...

01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:41.391
- Why don't you come outside?
-Let's have a--

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.977
- Have a bit of fresh air?
- Okay, okay! You get off of me!

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:55.947
Open the door, Daynin!
Answer me!

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:13.840
Why are you doing this to me?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.134
Piece of shit,
I hope you fucking die in hell.

01:08:20.972 --> 01:08:23.850
So, how does London
compare to Papay?

01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:26.269
Er, well...

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:28.605
there's a bit more going on.

01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:30.607
I guess.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:31.691
I'll bet.

01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:34.903
Have you ever been
down south?

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.989
Sometimes, not very often.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:40.534
Not very often.

01:08:40.534 --> 01:08:42.786
We hardly get away
and my husband's going,

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:45.956
"Oh, I can't see
the sea and the trees.

01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:48.500
And you can't see anything.
When are we going home?"

01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:55.257
Spot on.

01:08:55.257 --> 01:08:57.676
Thank you very much.
All the very best.

01:08:57.676 --> 01:08:59.761
See you soon.
See you again.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:02.347
Over there.
Last few casks of these...

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:06.184
Well, indeed, fine.
Thank you very much.

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:07.644
- Thank you.
- Good seeing the pair of you.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:09.187
- All the very best.
- Yes, I'll see you around, sir.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.647
Cheers, bye.
Cheers, all the best.

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:11.648
And you.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:13.733
-Hi, hi.
- Hi, hi.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.151
- How's it going?
- Good.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.030
Lovely.

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:21.533
I should introduce you
to my brother, Calum.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.618
- Oh, hello. Rona.
- Hi. How are you doing?

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.995
Hi, Rona.

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:26.204
Good to see you.

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:29.291
Rose Cottage?

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:30.375
Mm. Aye.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:33.336
Is it, uh,
bird work you're doing?

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.046
- Calum, stop.
- Ugh.

01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:37.966
He's so nosy,
he's like an old wife.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:43.597
Well, erm, I was
the warden of the nature reserve

01:09:43.597 --> 01:09:45.432
up there, back in the '80s.

01:09:45.432 --> 01:09:47.183
- Right.
- Before we had Rose Cottage.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.519
I stayed at Gowrie
just across the way.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.147
It was very basic.
Rose Cottage is a palace.

01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:53.398
Gowrie was a hovel.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:55.734
But it was my hovel.
I loved it very much.

01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:57.903
Erm, could I get some tobacco
as well, please?

01:09:57.903 --> 01:09:59.154
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:05.076
Is that it? Got everything?

01:10:05.744 --> 01:10:07.746
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.744
<i>The original
Beaufort scale</i>

01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:13.705
<i>didn't give wind speed
in miles per hour,</i>

01:12:13.705 --> 01:12:17.125
<i>but rather in terms
of its effects on sailing ships.</i>

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:19.627
<i>From "just sufficient
to give steerage"</i>

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:23.339
<i>to "that which no canvas sails
could withstand."</i>

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:28.678
<i>The wind is our most defining
weather in Orkney.</i>

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.139
<i>Even in summer,
there's usually a breeze.</i>

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:34.434
<i>Beaufort force three or four
on average.</i>

01:12:36.478 --> 01:12:38.897
<i>In Winter, gales are common.</i>

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.952
Come in! Come in!
I am one with the wind.

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:54.704
You're upsetting her!

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:57.415
Oh. Oh!

01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:58.750
Andrew...

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:01.211
Beautiful that is.
Beautiful, listen to it.

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:03.963
Breathe it in! Breathe it in!

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:06.341
-Lord, God...
- We are one with the wind.

01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:07.967
Oh, God,
please help him!

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:14.974
You don't understand.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:14:00.728
King of the castle.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:05.108
My subjects.
Welcome to my house.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.069
Rona, get in here!

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:09.445
I'm going to watch.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.447
All right, if you're
not going to come in...

01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:16.661
Aaah!

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:21.875
You having fun?

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:25.003
- Nah, I'm having an awful time.
- Looks like it.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.213
Really reminds me of home,
you know?

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.923
I forget
you're a farm girl.

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:34.345
- Aahil! Really?
- What?

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.139
- You really need to do that?
- What's the big deal?

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:37.307
What do you mean,
"It's not a big deal"?

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:38.391
Pick it up. It's not a bin.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:39.767
- All right, all right.
- That's what the big deal is.

01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:40.935
For fuck's sake.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.020
You know, he's terrified of you.

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.521
He's not terrified
of me, just...

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.148
- Yes.
- He knows I'm right.

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.025
You know...

01:14:48.193 --> 01:14:50.737
I'd never let my boys get away
with any of that shit.

01:14:50.737 --> 01:14:52.197
What do you mean, your boys?

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:55.283
You have kids?

01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:57.118
Yes, I have two boys.

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:58.620
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:01.497
It's why I get up
every morning, it's...

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.208
you know, for them.

01:15:05.627 --> 01:15:07.003
So, what age are they?

01:15:07.879 --> 01:15:09.756
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen?

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:11.049
Yeah, 14.

01:15:11.049 --> 01:15:13.801
I've not seen them in ten years,
though, so...

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:15.720
Better that way, who wants a...

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.014
You know, who wants
a crackhead for a dad?

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:19.557
Once I'm clean and...

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.019
Then I'll bring them here.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:25.939
We're nearly done here.

01:15:25.939 --> 01:15:27.815
What are you going to do
after all of this?

01:15:29.067 --> 01:15:30.193
Don't know.

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:33.905
Nothing.

01:15:34.364 --> 01:15:37.158
We can see if we can get
a horse ride set up.

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:40.828
I fucked it up.

01:15:41.913 --> 01:15:43.456
- I did.
- Hang on, hang on.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.460
Shut up. You asked.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.128
You asked.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:52.215
Well... Come on, listen.
See, I don't mean to...

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.549
Look at this brigade.

01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:57.428
If they can make it,
you can make it.

01:15:57.428 --> 01:16:00.139
I don't know about that.
You'll be fine.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:08.773
I can't be happy sober.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:38.636
Hi, Rona.

01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:41.889
- Hiya.
- Hiya, how are you doing?

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:43.808
- Good, how are you?
- Not bad at all.

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:46.227
What a lovely day,
isn't it a cracker?

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:47.562
You getting in
among the seaweeds?

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:49.897
-  Aye.
- You've come to the right place.

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:52.400
It's a seaweed supermarket.

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:54.777
Are you doing well?

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:56.696
- Lovely, lovely.
- Yeah.

01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:59.198
Well, I've just been doing
a spot of beachcombing.

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:00.450
What do you make of this?

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:04.078
The city of New York.

01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:05.288
Very nice.

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:09.375
Well...

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:12.086
Well, I'll let you get on.

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:13.212
And, er,

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:16.382
if there's anything you need,
just give us a shout, okay?

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.384
- Okay? Righto.
- Yeah, I will. Yeah.

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:20.845
- All the best. Cheerio for now.
- See you. Bye.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:58.341
<i>- Ro, Ro, there you are! Listen!</i>
- Hi.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.134
<i>This storm came through</i>

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.719
<i>and I've had to patch up
another window.</i>

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:02.845
Oh, no!

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.972
<i>I've almost run out
of gaffer tape.</i>

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:06.599
Right, and you've got to get
that fixed then, don't you?

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:08.267
<i>But listen, the real reason
I want to talk to you is</i>

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:10.395
<i>I've been in touch with the bank
and I've arranged a loan.</i>

01:18:10.395 --> 01:18:12.355
- But for what, Dad?
<i>- I've not arranged it yet,</i>

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.314
<i>but I will do.</i>

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:15.566
Can you turn the music down?
I can't hear you very well.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:16.818
Dad, can you turn
the music down?

01:18:16.818 --> 01:18:17.902
<i>I was in touch
with a fella from south</i>

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.695
<i>who's an intern on one of
these offshore wind farms and...</i>

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.281
<i>and the other thing is there's
a... Hey, you'll love this.</i>

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.075
<i>I was talking
to the geothermal physicist</i>

01:18:24.075 --> 01:18:25.535
<i>about the caves
under the ground there</i>

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:27.453
<i>- because I own them.</i>
- Dad, have you been sleeping?

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.580
<i>And the thing
about geothermal thing</i>

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.873
<i>is it's all about the storage.</i>

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:32.250
Okay. Dad? You need to sleep.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:34.085
<i>And there's fluctuations
in the wind speed.</i>

01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:36.045
You're not sleeping, are you?
Because you're getting high.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:38.464
<i>- Ro! Ro! Ro!</i>
- Yes, I'm listening to you.

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:40.675
<i>- I've no time for this.</i>
- You need to calm down, okay?

01:18:40.675 --> 01:18:43.177
<i>This is the avant garde,
I am on the forefront</i>

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:45.555
<i>of the ecological revolution.
This is wonderful work!</i>

01:18:45.555 --> 01:18:47.098
Will you please take
some sleeping pills

01:18:47.098 --> 01:18:48.558
and just go to sleep
for a few hours?

01:19:21.591 --> 01:19:22.425
Ah.

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:40.151
Oh, God.

01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:26.072
Hello?

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:32.411
Er, yeah, I'd love
to talk to him. Thank you.

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:36.999
-<i>Ro.</i>
- Hiya, Dad.

01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:40.920
- <i>Rona? Hello?</i>
- Yeah, are you okay?

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.005
<i>- Hello? Rona?</i>
- Hiya.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.507
<i>- It's Dad.</i>
- Yeah.

01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:48.094
<i>Listen, I have
a really important...</i>

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:52.098
<i>Did you...
Would you mind giving me some...</i>

01:20:53.224 --> 01:20:55.518
<i>- Well. Sorry, I...</i>
- Dad, are you okay?

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.228
Are you all right in there?

01:20:57.687 --> 01:21:00.773
<i>Listen, I have to talk
very quietly, I'm surrounded.</i>

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:03.192
- Okay.
<i>- I'm being held against my will</i>

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.610
<i>in an institution.</i>

01:21:05.403 --> 01:21:08.573
<i>And I need your help
to facilitate my release.</i>

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:10.908
<i>Do you think you can do that?</i>

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:15.413
No, Dad, because you have to
stay there until you get better.

01:21:15.413 --> 01:21:17.206
<i>God! God!</i>

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.792
<i>You put me in here
in the first place</i>

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:22.003
<i>and you won't give yourself
the opportunity</i>

01:21:22.003 --> 01:21:23.754
<i>to redeem yourself
by getting me out.</i>

01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:25.715
- Dad, I didn't put you anywhere.
<i>- Listen...</i>

01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:27.925
<i>You goddamn, you know
bloody well what you did.</i>

01:21:28.676 --> 01:21:30.720
- What did I do?
<i>- You called the cops.</i>

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.139
Dad, I didn't call the cops.
Not at all.

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:36.350
<i>You called the cops.
They came and they took me away.</i>

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.185
I know, Dad,
but I think it's because

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:39.979
- everyone was worried about you.
<i>- No!</i>

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:41.564
I think somebody else called.

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:44.191
<i>You break my heart.</i>

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.485
<i>You break my heart.</i>

01:21:48.738 --> 01:21:50.823
<i>You are a deceitful woman.</i>

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.283
<i>You are a...</i>

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:04.837
Okay.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:07.923
<i>Don't disappoint me any more
than you already have, Rona.</i>

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:10.343
I'm gonna go. I'll check in
with you later, okay?

01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:12.303
<i>Rona! Now, you pull your...</i>

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:15.890
Fuck!

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.291
Hey, you need a ride?

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:31.173
<i>I can give you a lift,
if you like.</i>

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:32.508
To Daynin's house.

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:35.261
Good.
I'll take you there. Jump in.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.513
Thank you.

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:46.689
Hi. Hiya.

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:56.574
Well, I bumped into someone
who's giving me a lift to yours,

01:23:56.574 --> 01:23:58.784
because he knows where you live.

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:07.960
Don't you want it?

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.003
You bitch!

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:10.171
Help me!

01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:11.756
Help!

01:24:15.426 --> 01:24:17.178
Shit!
No, help me!

01:24:17.178 --> 01:24:18.554
Come back here. Wait!

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:19.805
Help!

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:01.764
Hi.

01:25:04.183 --> 01:25:05.226
Hey.

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:34.922
So, how have you been?

01:25:34.922 --> 01:25:36.340
I'm good.

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:41.637
How's your job?

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:49.895
- I mean, I got that promotion.
- Oh, wow.

01:25:50.396 --> 01:25:51.814
Big boss man now.

01:25:53.274 --> 01:25:54.984
- Got an assistant.
- Ah.

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.237
- Office?
- Tiny one.

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.455
Are you seeing anyone
or anything?

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:13.919
Yeah.

01:26:17.131 --> 01:26:18.257
Right.

01:26:21.427 --> 01:26:22.845
She is nice.

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:26.473
Kind, you know.

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.897
- It's different.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:38.402
It's boring, I bet.

01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:42.364
I'm glad you're happy.

01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:47.995
I like your hair.

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:49.747
Oh, yeah?

01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:51.832
Yeah.

01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:55.210
It's nice.

01:27:04.887 --> 01:27:06.055
Fuck you!

01:27:12.353 --> 01:27:14.021
You wanna go for a drink?

01:29:19.104 --> 01:29:20.397
There's a berg.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:23.859
Lads, there's a berg,
there's a berg!

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:26.070
To the starboard.

01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:29.823
Woo! Steady as she goes, lads.

01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:31.033
Steady as she goes!

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.868
We got a berg
to the starboard, lads!

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:35.245
You gotta hustle up, hustle up.
Go on.

01:29:35.245 --> 01:29:36.371
Okay.

01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:40.042
Crow's nest!

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:42.127
Can you hear me?

01:29:43.504 --> 01:29:45.714
Is it all clear up north?

01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:49.635
Yep, we're heading north.

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:24.336
Come on, come on!

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.695
Well done. You did really well.

01:31:07.421 --> 01:31:08.964
- Hi, Rona.
- Hiya, you all right?

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:11.550
- Aye, not bad. How is yourself?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:12.885
Just had to get a bit of air,

01:31:12.885 --> 01:31:14.344
it was getting
really hot in there.

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:16.889
Aye, all right, not half.
There's a lot going on.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:18.974
- Aye.
- Aye.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.687
So how long you been sober?

01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:31.737
Sixty-three days.

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:33.238
Wow.

01:31:34.364 --> 01:31:36.825
That's the steepest bit
you've done.

01:31:38.952 --> 01:31:40.120
So, what about you?

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:42.581
Oh, boy. Erm...

01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:45.709
Twelve years.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.378
Four months.

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:49.838
And...

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.423
twenty-nine days.

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:53.508
Damn.

01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:56.428
How is that?

01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:01.141
Well, it's okay.

01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:03.101
Started off one day at a time.

01:32:04.353 --> 01:32:05.979
Twelve years
and four months later,

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:07.689
it's still one day at a time.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:09.441
Because that's the only way.

01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:10.943
And it works.

01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:12.236
And you're doing it.

01:32:14.988 --> 01:32:16.657
So it gets easier, does it?

01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:18.575
Oh, yes. Yes, it does.

01:32:19.993 --> 01:32:22.329
- You have my word on that.
- Mm.

01:32:23.205 --> 01:32:24.873
But...

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:27.876
it never gets easy.
It just gets less hard.

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:06.665
<i>The marine traffic
and flight radar websites</i>

01:33:06.665 --> 01:33:10.669
<i>show in real-time
the paths of all vessels at sea</i>

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:13.213
<i>and all commercial aircraft
in the sky.</i>

01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:19.678
<i>A light that moves
above the cottage</i>

01:33:19.678 --> 01:33:23.181
<i>is a Lufthansa flight

01:33:28.437 --> 01:33:31.148
<i>I monitor the path of

01:33:31.148 --> 01:33:33.608
<i>And find out
when it's passing over.</i>

01:33:42.326 --> 01:33:44.411
<i>Tonight it flies over Orkney.</i>

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.441
- Merry Christmas.
-Hi, Rona.

01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:16.360
Not got good news.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.487
There's no flights
coming in today.

01:34:18.487 --> 01:34:19.571
What?

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:21.573
There's a technical fault
with the plane.

01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:23.533
And there's no flights
coming in at all.

01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:24.951
What about tomorrow?

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:28.080
No, they're waiting on parts
and engineers and...

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.790
And I'm afraid

01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:32.292
the boats are away
into the town for Christmas.

01:34:32.292 --> 01:34:33.668
<i>A fresh kinda day</i>

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:35.420
<i>with strong
easterly winds and rain.</i>

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.881
<i>Winds are likely
to get up to near gale force</i>

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:38.965
<i>just before midday,</i>

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.967
<i>but they will ease off
for the afternoon.</i>

01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:43.470
<i>Temperatures will be struggling
to get into double figures.</i>

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:45.972
<i>Maybe nine degrees Celsius
at a push. That's just...</i>

01:35:20.173 --> 01:35:22.092
Woo!

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:30.100
Woo!

01:35:41.153 --> 01:35:43.071
Woo!

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:52.849
-Hey, Rona.
- Hi.

01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:54.309
- How are you doing?
- Good.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:55.393
You been for a swim?

01:36:55.393 --> 01:36:57.979
- Yeah.
- Fantastic. Gosh, look at you.

01:37:13.328 --> 01:37:15.705
<i>For you</i>

01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:20.335
<i>My heart cries out, Perfidia</i>

01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:27.008
<i>For I found you
the love of my life...</i>

01:37:27.551 --> 01:37:29.636
<i>Move!</i>
<i>Get it out!</i>

01:37:29.636 --> 01:37:31.721
<i>It's back on me now.</i>

01:37:31.721 --> 01:37:32.639
<i>It's on me.</i>

01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:33.932
<i>Get the pigeon off me.</i>

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:35.016
<i>It's not on you.</i>

01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:36.726
<i>Well, it is!</i>

01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:38.228
<i>I'm gonna get it
with the...</i>

01:37:38.228 --> 01:37:40.939
<i>Come back here, sir...
young lad.</i>

01:37:52.576 --> 01:37:53.618
Come on!

01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:02.103
Hey.

01:39:04.731 --> 01:39:05.982
- How is it?
- Windy.

01:39:05.982 --> 01:39:07.067
Yeah.

01:39:07.734 --> 01:39:08.860
Elena, this is my mum.

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:09.778
Oh.

01:39:09.778 --> 01:39:11.363
Oh, it's really nice
to meet you.

01:39:11.363 --> 01:39:12.947
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

01:39:12.947 --> 01:39:15.367
- You have a lovely daughter.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:39:15.367 --> 01:39:17.577
- She's been looking after me.
- Oh!

01:39:19.329 --> 01:39:22.123
They're just some drawings
I've done and stuff.

01:39:27.295 --> 01:39:28.421
Do you want a cup of tea?

01:39:28.421 --> 01:39:30.006
- Oh, yes.
- It's warmer in the kitchen.

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:31.966
- Shall we go there?
- Lovely, thank you.

01:39:34.928 --> 01:39:36.721
And I made some bread.

01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:39.724
And it's your recipe.

01:39:39.724 --> 01:39:41.810
Oh, Rona, that looks wonderful.

01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:44.020
It may poison you.

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:49.359
- So, do you like it?
- Mm.

01:39:49.359 --> 01:39:51.695
So, how long do you think
you'll stay here for?

01:39:52.237 --> 01:39:53.655
Erm...

01:39:53.655 --> 01:39:55.573
Don't know,
probably till the spring.

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:58.952
- That long?
- Yeah.

01:39:58.952 --> 01:40:01.371
Well, I'm thinking
about changing my PhD.

01:40:01.371 --> 01:40:04.124
I've become really,
really fascinated with seaweed

01:40:04.124 --> 01:40:05.750
and the whole seaweed industry.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:08.878
Seaweed farming
is kind of changing the world.

01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:12.465
It's always been around
in eastern parts of the world.

01:40:12.465 --> 01:40:14.759
And, yeah,
we're not really exploring that

01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:16.010
as much as we used to.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.012
So, what I'm thinking
about doing

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:20.849
is studying seaweed farming.

01:40:22.517 --> 01:40:24.102
So, I started to look into it

01:40:24.102 --> 01:40:26.771
and there's all these
different benefits to seaweed.

01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:30.108
There's, you know,
soil fertilizers.

01:40:30.108 --> 01:40:31.943
If you feed it to cows,
it's a really great way,

01:40:31.943 --> 01:40:34.279
a great natural way
to fertilize the soil.

01:40:34.279 --> 01:40:36.239
The cattle produce less methane

01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:37.907
when they burp
and when they fart.

01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:39.784
And, you know,
it supplies your body

01:40:39.784 --> 01:40:43.329
with magnesium, copper,
all these different things.

01:40:43.329 --> 01:40:46.583
It also supplies the earth
with 60% of its oxygen.

01:40:46.583 --> 01:40:48.168
I thought
that was the rainforest.

01:40:48.168 --> 01:40:51.212
No. Common misconception,
but it's marine plants.

01:40:51.212 --> 01:40:54.716
It's in our toothpaste.
It's part of our culture,

01:40:54.716 --> 01:40:57.051
our mythology, everything.

01:40:57.051 --> 01:40:58.762
If everyone
got on board with it,

01:40:58.762 --> 01:41:00.597
it could change the world.

01:41:00.597 --> 01:41:02.640
And so,
I want to be a part of it.

01:41:09.564 --> 01:41:10.732
How is Dad?

01:41:10.732 --> 01:41:12.650
He's coming home next week.

01:41:12.650 --> 01:41:14.444
Where is he going to stay?

01:41:14.444 --> 01:41:16.780
The caravan on the farm,
of course.

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:17.864
Of course.

01:41:19.741 --> 01:41:22.535
I mean, we're not going to
get him to live anywhere else,

01:41:22.535 --> 01:41:24.662
- are we?
- Absolutely not.

01:41:24.662 --> 01:41:26.414
I should go back then.

01:41:26.414 --> 01:41:28.792
At least I can cook for him,
I can get him stuff in.

01:41:28.792 --> 01:41:30.585
Rona, please,
don't worry so much.

01:41:30.585 --> 01:41:31.753
-But I do worry.
- No.

01:41:31.753 --> 01:41:34.464
He's had to go through this
over and over again.

01:41:34.464 --> 01:41:36.841
You know,
you have to look after yourself.

01:41:36.841 --> 01:41:39.928
That's what I had to do,
you know.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.266
Was it really hard for you?

01:41:46.643 --> 01:41:48.520
Just having me, having the farm,

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:51.272
he just wasn't... there.

01:41:53.107 --> 01:41:54.442
Mm, it was.

01:41:54.943 --> 01:41:55.944
It was.

01:41:56.736 --> 01:41:58.655
At times it was very difficult.

01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:02.033
He'd be away for months.

01:42:03.493 --> 01:42:06.913
And then even when
he wasn't away, I was...

01:42:08.248 --> 01:42:09.874
very lonely, sometimes.

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.336
- Mm.
- Yeah.

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:17.090
Then I found God, or rather...

01:42:18.007 --> 01:42:19.425
God found me.

01:42:22.512 --> 01:42:23.513
Mm.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.747
<i>All things come
from the ocean.</i>

01:42:49.747 --> 01:42:51.624
<i>And the ocean takes them back.</i>

01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:53.918
<i>And eventually, one day,</i>

01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:56.254
<i>they might come back again
to the land.</i>

01:43:02.302 --> 01:43:05.013
<i>After a gale is when
the best things are found.</i>

01:43:14.647 --> 01:43:17.066
<i>Parts of the Udal Law
from old Norse times</i>

01:43:17.066 --> 01:43:18.985
<i>still apply in Orkney.</i>

01:43:21.446 --> 01:43:24.115
<i>And if you find something
on the shore of your farmland,</i>

01:43:24.115 --> 01:43:26.242
<i>and its above
the low water mark,</i>

01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:28.119
<i>it's yours.</i>

01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:02.570
<i>There's a festival
that's about to happen here,</i>

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:03.905
<i>it's called the Gyro Nights.</i>

01:44:03.905 --> 01:44:04.822
<i>Oh.</i>

01:44:04.822 --> 01:44:07.241
So all these artists
from all over the country,

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:09.160
all over the world actually
are coming in.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.664
And we've been, like,
arranging the whole thing.

01:44:12.664 --> 01:44:14.248
And putting banners up.

01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:16.209
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

01:44:16.209 --> 01:44:18.544
<i>You're coming for my job.</i>

01:44:20.046 --> 01:44:23.132
<i>So, erm, no, but really,
how are you doing?</i>

01:44:23.132 --> 01:44:24.425
I'm fine.

01:44:24.425 --> 01:44:27.512
- I'm actually, yeah...
<i>- I mean, you look great, like...</i>

01:44:27.512 --> 01:44:31.307
I'm probably the best I've been
in a really long time.

01:44:32.809 --> 01:44:33.810
Promise.

01:45:04.257 --> 01:45:05.299
Gyro!

01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:07.760
Gyro!

01:45:08.970 --> 01:45:10.013
Gyro!

01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:15.435
I got it. Yeah, I got it.

01:45:49.385 --> 01:45:50.928
Do you want to sit down?

01:45:50.928 --> 01:45:52.513
Yeah, please.

01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:56.434
- It's a bit messy.
- That's okay.

01:45:56.434 --> 01:45:57.518
Here you go.

01:46:02.356 --> 01:46:03.399
So cold.

01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:06.069
Do you mind
if I take my socks off?

01:46:06.069 --> 01:46:07.820
No. That's what I'm gonna do.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:08.905
Soaking wet.

01:46:10.031 --> 01:46:11.199
Give me the socks.

01:46:11.199 --> 01:46:12.283
Thank you.

01:46:15.495 --> 01:46:17.747
- Ah, that's better.
- So much better.

01:46:17.747 --> 01:46:19.916
I loved that tonight,
it was fun.

01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:21.501
Such a nice evening.

01:46:21.501 --> 01:46:23.503
I actually had a dream
the other night

01:46:23.503 --> 01:46:26.255
- that all my hair was on fire.
- Okay.

01:46:26.255 --> 01:46:28.508
That sounds quite scary.

01:46:28.508 --> 01:46:30.968
Yeah. Kind of amazing, though.

01:46:31.719 --> 01:46:35.014
My hair was just flames
running around.

01:46:38.893 --> 01:46:41.145
So, you go back tomorrow?

01:46:41.145 --> 01:46:43.189
Yeah, getting the ferry
in the morning.

01:46:46.442 --> 01:46:47.443
Hmm.

01:46:54.867 --> 01:46:55.868
Hmm.

01:47:20.852 --> 01:47:22.854
<i>In grandiose moments,</i>

01:47:22.854 --> 01:47:26.524
<i>high on fresh air
and freedom on the hill,</i>

01:47:26.524 --> 01:47:28.776
<i>I study my personal geology.</i>

01:47:31.112 --> 01:47:32.989
<i>My body is a continent.</i>

01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:37.702
<i>I grind my teeth in my sleep</i>

01:47:37.702 --> 01:47:39.912
<i>like tectonic plates.</i>

01:47:41.414 --> 01:47:43.875
<i>And when I blink,
the sun flickers.</i>

01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:48.462
<i>My breath pushes the clouds
across the sky.</i>

01:47:48.462 --> 01:47:50.923
<i>And the waves roll
in to the shore</i>

01:47:50.923 --> 01:47:53.009
<i>in time with my beating heart.</i>

01:47:55.553 --> 01:47:58.222
<i>The island's headlands
rise above the sea</i>

01:47:58.222 --> 01:48:00.516
<i>like my limbs in the bathtub.</i>

01:48:01.893 --> 01:48:04.770
<i>My freckles
are famous landmarks.</i>

01:48:05.605 --> 01:48:08.149
<i>And my tears, rivers.</i>

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:13.905
<i>Lightning strikes
every time I sneeze.</i>

01:48:15.281 --> 01:48:16.657
<i>And when I orgasm,</i>

01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:18.910
<i>there is an earthquake.</i>

01:51:58.295 --> 01:52:00.131
Mm?
