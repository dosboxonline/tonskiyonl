WEBVTT

00:19.185 --> 00:20.819
Now, children

00:21.321 --> 00:23.355
Are you sitting comfortably?

00:23.656 --> 00:25.090
Then I'll begin.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.895
"This story started many thousands
of years ago

00:30.063 --> 00:32.931
but it was all over in just seven days.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.167
All that long, long time ago

00:35.335 --> 00:37.302
none of the things we can see now

00:37.470 --> 00:42.207
. . .the sun, the moon, the stars
the earth, the animals and plants

00:42.375 --> 00:44.276
. . . not a single one existed.

00:44.444 --> 00:49.048
Only God existed, and so only
He could have created them.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.749
And He did . . . "

03:00.647 --> 03:03.549
Mr. sim pson . . . , what a character he was!

03:03.716 --> 03:04.683
I wonder whatever beca me of him?

03:04.851 --> 03:07.986
Oh, I imagine he's dead
like all the rest.

03:08.154 --> 03:10.589
Ah, those were the days...

03:20.366 --> 03:22.167
Mr. Tuttle, your hair!

03:30.276 --> 03:31.109
Yes . . .

03:31.277 --> 03:34.646
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the . . .

03:34.814 --> 03:39.451
Oh yes, of course . . . come in.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.522
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.331
You are . . . ?

03:52.832 --> 03:56.702
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.
And this is Ed m und Tuttle.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.370
Pleased to meet you, ma'a m.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.105
You m ust be the gardener.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.574
Ay, that's right, the gardener. . .

04:02.742 --> 04:06.278
And this young lady's called Lydia.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.014
Have you had m uch experience in service?

04:09.182 --> 04:12.217
Oh, don't let that angel
face fool you, ma'a m .

04:12.552 --> 04:14.720
She's older than she looks.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.421
Can you iron?

04:18.891 --> 04:21.260
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

04:21.661 --> 04:24.496
Ah, she can't talk, ma'am.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.132
The poor little mite's a m ute.

04:27.300 --> 04:27.966
Oh!

04:28.134 --> 04:31.470
Oh, but she's a good little worker
I can promise you that.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.473
All right. All right.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.542
The other girl I had spoke
too m uch anyway. Follow me.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.045
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl
you will sleep in the attic room

04:40.213 --> 04:41.713
at the top of the stairs.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.116
And you, Mr. . . .

04:44.284 --> 04:45.183
Tuttle, ma'am.

04:45.351 --> 04:49.988
. . . Ah Tuttle . . . you can sleep in the shed
around the back.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.058
As you can see, the housework
has been rather negIected

04:53.226 --> 04:56.128
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.063
You mean they just vanished?

04:58.231 --> 05:01.300
Into thin air. . . no notice . . . nothing.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.567
They didn't even collect their wages.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.871
They . . . they just left us.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.973
What a strange thing to do!

05:08.775 --> 05:10.509
You'll soon find out there
are times when this house

05:10.677 --> 05:13.145
is not exactly an ideal home.

05:13.746 --> 05:18.917
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper
requesting honest, hardworking people.

05:19.218 --> 05:21.553
Oh, there's nobody more honest
and hardworking than us

05:21.721 --> 05:23.121
isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?

05:23.289 --> 05:25.290
Oh, ay, we're very honest...

05:25.458 --> 05:28.560
And uh m, . . . very hardworking.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.065
The kitchen.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.803
I have breakfast at eight
the chiIdren at nine.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.106
Lunch will be served at one
and dinner at half past seven.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.041
And the master, ma'am?

05:46.012 --> 05:50.349
The master went off to war. . .
a year and a half ago.

05:51.217 --> 05:56.221
I had no news since the war ended
Which of you does the cooking?

05:56.389 --> 05:58.090
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.659
Which of you does the cooking?

06:00.827 --> 06:02.494
Have you all noticed what l am doing?

06:02.995 --> 06:06.732
In this house no door m ust be opened
without the previous

06:06.899 --> 06:08.300
one being closed first.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.969
It's vital that you reme m ber this.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.904
It's not as easy as it may seem.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.941
There are fifteen different keys
for alI of the fifty doors,

06:16.109 --> 06:18.977
depending on which area of the house
you're in at the time.

06:19.779 --> 06:23.215
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards
I will be Ieaving a set of keys

06:23.383 --> 06:24.983
in your charge.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.451
Yes, ma'a m.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.086
The m usic room.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.322
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.892
Please do not let the children
thu m p away on it

06:34.761 --> 06:36.361
it sets off my migraine.

06:36.529 --> 06:40.665
Silence is something that we prize
very highly in this house.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.901
That's why you will not find a telephone

06:43.069 --> 06:46.204
a radio or anything else
that makes a racket.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.707
Ah . . . we don't have electricity either.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.742
During the war, the Germans kept
cutting it off

06:50.910 --> 06:52.611
so we just learned to live without it.

06:52.779 --> 06:53.478
Let's continue . . .

06:53.646 --> 06:56.114
M a'a m, there's really no need to show us
around the whoIe house, we . . .

06:56.282 --> 06:59.418
Yes! Yes, there is.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.121
Because here, most of the time
you can hardly see your way.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.291
lt's often difficult to make out
if there is a table, a chair, a door

07:06.459 --> 07:12.264
a sideboard or one of my children
playing Hide-And-seek.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.699
What do you mean ma'am?

07:16.335 --> 07:18.703
Perhaps I should introduce
you to the children.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.545
Mr. Tuttle, you can see
to the garden now.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.013
You'll find tools in the shed.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.481
Yes, ma'a m.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.783
You two can start closing the curtains.

07:32.652 --> 07:33.985
All of them.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.650
Come.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.563
I'll wake them. You wait here.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.567
Whatever you do
don't open the curtains.

08:25.771 --> 08:27.472
Wakey-wakey

08:30.576 --> 08:35.080
Now, come on, eyes closed
hands together.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.116
Blessed be, at light of day,

08:38.284 --> 08:40.485
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.787
Blessed be the Virgin pure

08:42.955 --> 08:45.023
Whom I greet with faith so sure.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.158
Jesus, M ary, spotless Rose,

08:47.326 --> 08:49.928
Keep us till this day doth close.

08:56.302 --> 08:57.869
They're still half-asleep.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.639
What sweet little children!

09:01.908 --> 09:05.143
Well? What do you say?

09:05.811 --> 09:09.648
How do you do?

09:10.249 --> 09:12.317
How do you do, children?

09:12.718 --> 09:17.756
My name's Mrs. Mills, but
you can call me Bertha if you like.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.724
What are your names?

09:19.892 --> 09:20.759
Anne.

09:20.927 --> 09:21.693
Nicholas.

09:21.861 --> 09:26.598
Anne and Nicholas. What pretty names!

09:26.866 --> 09:29.200
Are you going to be our new nanny?

09:33.205 --> 09:36.107
Yes, my dears. I'm your new nanny.

09:36.275 --> 09:37.876
It's time for their breakfast.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.645
Lydia, you go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.921
The doctors were never
able to find a cure.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.556
For what?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.892
Their condition.

09:54.961 --> 09:58.296
The children have a very serious
alIergy to light.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.566
They are photosensitive and they m ust
never be exposed to any Iight

10:01.734 --> 10:03.501
m uch stronger than this.

10:04.303 --> 10:05.670
Otherwise in a matter of minutes

10:05.838 --> 10:10.875
they would break out in sores and
blisters and begin to suffocate.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.711
It would eventually be fatal.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.479
Good Heavens!

10:16.248 --> 10:17.649
I don't like this toast.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.417
Oh, why not?

10:19.585 --> 10:21.553
It tastes funny.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.455
I liked it better before.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.826
Well, that was because, before
somebody else made it.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.629
When are they coming back?

10:32.598 --> 10:34.666
They're not won't be coming back, child.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.368
Just like daddy.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.804
Daddy is coming back, though.

10:40.039 --> 10:43.575
Mrs. Mills, our father is fighting
in a war in France, you know.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.076
It's the World War.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.811
I know, but he's in France.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.482
That's enough chatterboxes . . .
finish up your breakfasts.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.485
Are you going to leave us, too?

10:55.688 --> 10:59.758
Of course not. Why should l leave you?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.160
The others said they wouldn't.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.829
But they did . . . and then it happened.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.831
Be quiet.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.436
What do you mean Anne . . . ? What happened?

11:13.639 --> 11:17.275
M u m my went. . . mad.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.943
Nothing happened.

11:19.211 --> 11:19.778
Yes it did.

11:19.945 --> 11:20.745
No it didn't!

11:20.913 --> 11:21.880
Yes, it did!

11:22.048 --> 11:23.381
Be quiet!

11:25.885 --> 11:27.185
What's going on?

11:27.853 --> 11:29.654
I want to see those plates em pty
in less than a minute.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.256
Is that clear?

11:34.894 --> 11:39.197
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside
a moment, I'd like a word with you.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.167
Yes, ma'a m.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.709
The postman usually comes every
Wednesday, but I've just checked the

11:50.876 --> 11:52.944
letter box and this week he hasn't.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.281
I'm afraid I don't follow ma'a m .

11:56.449 --> 11:58.783
This letter should have been collected
and delivered to the newspaper

11:58.951 --> 12:00.351
five days ago.

12:00.519 --> 12:01.920
It's an advertise ment for servants.

12:02.088 --> 12:04.322
Since it was never published
wouId you mind explaining to me

12:04.490 --> 12:06.057
what you're doing here?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.259
Now I understand.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.262
Well, ma'am, that's exactly
what I was going to say

12:11.430 --> 12:13.765
to you when you opened the door to us.

12:13.933 --> 12:18.236
The truth is that we just come
by on the off-chance.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.874
You know a big house like this is always
in need of someone who knows the ropes.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.710
You mean you've served in a house
Iike this one before?

12:25.878 --> 12:28.813
This may come as a surprise
to you ma'am

12:29.882 --> 12:32.283
but we in fact used to work here.

12:33.719 --> 12:34.552
Here?

12:34.720 --> 12:38.123
Oh now, it was a few years ago . . .

12:39.725 --> 12:43.595
and if you don't mind my saying so
ma'a m they were the best years

12:43.763 --> 12:45.163
of my life.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.700
That's why we come by
because this house

12:49.468 --> 12:51.536
means a lot to us.

12:52.671 --> 12:54.439
Perhaps I'd best
show you our references ma'am.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.941
No, no, no. Don't bother
there's no need.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.511
Ah, so you say you know the house well?

12:59.745 --> 13:03.615
Like the back of my hand . . . Well
that is always assu ming that the waIls

13:03.783 --> 13:07.285
haven't sprouted legs and
moved in the meantime.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.754
The only thing that moves here
is the light.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.093
But it changes everything.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.600
It's rather difficult, to say the least

13:23.602 --> 13:27.572
one might almost say unbearable.

13:30.242 --> 13:33.144
The only way of enduring it is
by keeping a cool head.

13:34.346 --> 13:35.947
Oh, Yes ma'am.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.250
I don't like . . .fantasies . . .
strange ideas.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.019
Do you know what I mean?

13:41.921 --> 13:43.588
I think so, ma'am .

13:43.756 --> 13:46.891
My children sometimes have strange ideas

13:48.794 --> 13:50.962
but you m ustn't pay any
ttention to them.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.598
Children will be children.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.835
Yes, of course, ma'am.

13:57.102 --> 14:01.840
All right, you can stay.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.210
Thank you very m uch, ma'am.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.523
It did happened.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.404
The Roman governor tried to make
them change their minds afterwards . . . "

14:33.572 --> 14:34.873
"To make them change their minds."

14:35.040 --> 14:38.309
Full stop. "Afterwards . . . "
"Afterwards

14:38.644 --> 14:40.111
he ordered them to be beaten.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.013
But Justus and Pastor. . . "

14:42.181 --> 14:45.149
far from being afraid,
rejoiced and showed themselves

14:45.317 --> 14:47.085
willing to die for Christ.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.255
When he saw this, the Roman governor
was filled with rage and

14:50.422 --> 14:52.724
ordered their heads to be cut off."

14:57.563 --> 14:59.297
What do you find so am using?

15:01.600 --> 15:02.800
Well . . .

15:03.102 --> 15:04.636
Well, what?

15:04.803 --> 15:07.705
Those children were really stupid.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.475
Why?
Because they said they only believed

15:10.643 --> 15:13.478
in Jesus and then
they got kiIled for it.

15:14.179 --> 15:16.114
Ah, and what would you have done?
Deny Christ?

15:16.282 --> 15:17.782
Well, yes.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.918
Inside, I would have believed in him.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.687
But I wouldn't have
told the Romans that.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.258
Is that what you think, too, Nicholas?

15:31.196 --> 15:33.064
I see.

15:33.799 --> 15:37.035
so you both would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.504
Oh you'd have saved your heads being
chopped off by the Romans . . .

15:39.672 --> 15:41.239
that's true . . .

15:41.573 --> 15:43.574
But what would have happened afterwards?

15:43.742 --> 15:45.009
When?

15:45.177 --> 15:49.180
In the next life, the one that's waiting
for us after we die.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.048
Where would you have gone?

15:50.215 --> 15:50.548
Oh.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.785
Oh . . . where, Nicholas?

15:54.086 --> 15:55.553
To the children's Lim bo.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.422
What is the children's Lim bo, Anne?

15:57.589 --> 15:59.290
One of the four Hells.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.192
Which are . . . ?

16:04.596 --> 16:05.964
M e, me, me, me, me . . . me!

16:06.131 --> 16:08.700
No, no, no. Let him answer. Which are?

16:09.134 --> 16:13.905
There's the hell where the da m ned go
then there's Purgatory

16:14.073 --> 16:14.405
Yes

16:14.573 --> 16:16.441
and the Bosom of Abraham
where the Just go

16:16.608 --> 16:17.909
and Lim bo where children go.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.911
At the centre of the Earth.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.213
Where it's very, very hot.

16:22.948 --> 16:24.349
That's where children go who tell lies.

16:24.516 --> 16:27.719
But they don't just go there
for a few days, oh no.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.956
No, they're dam ned, forever.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.092
Think about it.

16:35.627 --> 16:39.797
Try to imagine the end of eternity.

16:40.366 --> 16:44.702
Close your eyes, close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

16:46.338 --> 16:53.044
Forever. . . pain. Forever.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.080
I'm getting dizzy.

16:58.317 --> 17:01.686
Now do you understand why Justus
and Pastor told the truth?

17:05.991 --> 17:10.994
Right, ah, open your
readers at Lesson 6.

17:11.163 --> 17:11.929
Can't we go and play?

17:12.097 --> 17:13.664
You most certainly cannot.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.967
First you're going to read the lesson
and then you're going

17:16.135 --> 17:18.202
to learn it, by heart.

17:18.369 --> 17:18.903
All of it?!

17:19.070 --> 17:22.874
Anne, any more protests and there'll be
no pIaying for you at aIl today.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.411
In fact, I think you can study
in separate rooms . . .

17:26.578 --> 17:27.244
No, no, no!

17:27.413 --> 17:29.213
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes . . . !

17:29.381 --> 17:30.715
But we get scared if we're separated.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.016
You get scared . . . !

17:32.184 --> 17:34.118
As if you weren't used
to this house by now.

17:34.286 --> 17:36.587
What if we see a ghost?

17:37.289 --> 17:39.157
Has your sister been telling
you one of her stories?

17:39.324 --> 17:40.691
I haven't told him anything.

17:40.859 --> 17:43.795
Well, if you see a ghost, you say hello
and you continue on studying.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.263
Anne, come with me to the m usic room.

17:45.431 --> 17:46.130
Why me?

17:46.298 --> 17:49.901
Because l say so! Now come on
take your book.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.371
Nicholas, I want to see that
lesson learned in less than an hour.

17:53.972 --> 17:54.939
M u m my . . .

17:55.107 --> 17:56.474
What?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.843
Give me a kiss.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.112
Oh sweet. . .
"Give me a kiss, give me a kiss . . . "

18:01.280 --> 18:03.481
Anne, wait for me outside.

18:03.882 --> 18:05.650
You know I can't.

18:07.319 --> 18:08.553
Over there.

18:11.023 --> 18:14.225
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.328
My daughter is going to cross
the living room.

18:17.796 --> 18:18.996
Yes ma'am.

18:26.705 --> 18:27.872
All right darling.

18:30.976 --> 18:37.615
Darling, m u m my can't be with you
aIl the time, h m m?

18:39.017 --> 18:41.319
You m ust learn to be on your own.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.356
Where's your rosary?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.159
Ah,

18:49.595 --> 18:54.332
whenever you feel afraid
I want you to squeeze it with

18:54.500 --> 18:58.636
all your might and say an Our Father
and then your fear wilI go away.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.403
It won't. . .

18:59.571 --> 19:02.240
Yes, yes it will. Honestly.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.511
Don't you see that when you do that
the Lord is with you?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.348
There's no reason to be afraid.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.256
"The house and the family.

19:52.591 --> 19:55.459
We all live in a house with our family.

19:55.727 --> 20:01.399
The fa mily is usually made up of parents
children, and their grandparents.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.568
We m ust be obedient and kind . . . "

20:03.735 --> 20:07.038
" . . . obedient and kind towards the other
mem bers of our family and

20:07.206 --> 20:11.275
we m ust never argue or fight with
our brothers and sisters . . . "

20:12.578 --> 20:13.878
Do you have any children?

20:14.046 --> 20:18.516
No. Mr Tuttle and the girl
Lydia, are all I've got.

20:18.684 --> 20:21.152
And I'm all they've got.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.954
Was she born like that?

20:24.189 --> 20:25.690
Beg your pardon, ma'am ?

20:25.857 --> 20:29.026
The girl, was she born a m ute?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.295
No . . .

20:32.965 --> 20:34.999
You know l think
I've finished here ma'a m.

20:35.167 --> 20:39.437
If you'll excuse me, l think I'll
go and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

21:10.235 --> 21:11.435
Nicholas!

21:16.308 --> 21:17.642
Nicholas, I'm coming!

21:25.284 --> 21:26.117
Nicholas . . . ?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.084
What's the matter?

21:27.252 --> 21:28.252
Why were you crying?

21:28.420 --> 21:30.755
I wasn't crying. I was reading.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.257
But I just heard you . . .

21:33.458 --> 21:35.593
Anne! . . . Anne!

21:42.267 --> 21:46.504
Anne! Anne!

21:47.339 --> 21:49.273
I haven't learned it yet, m u m my.

21:49.775 --> 21:50.875
Are you all right?

21:51.043 --> 21:52.243
Yes.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.278
Why were you crying?

21:54.446 --> 21:55.980
I wasn't crying.

21:56.348 --> 21:58.549
But I just heard you a moment ago.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.852
There's no need to feel ashamed darling.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.523
I don't. lf I'd been crying
I'd tell you.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.825
Oh, really. So, I imagined it, did I?

22:07.993 --> 22:10.161
No. It was that boy.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.229
What boy?

22:12.898 --> 22:14.465
Victor.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.801
Who's Victor?

22:17.369 --> 22:19.570
The boy who was here a moment ago.

22:19.738 --> 22:23.307
I told him to let me study
but he wouldn't stop crying.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.810
I think he's a spoilt brat.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.412
He said we had to leave the house.

22:28.580 --> 22:31.649
Did he now? Why was he crying?

22:31.817 --> 22:35.086
Because he doesn't like this house
but he has to live here.

22:35.387 --> 22:38.055
His father's a pianist and . . .
Oh. ah, his father's a pianist, is he?

22:38.223 --> 22:39.256
Yes.

22:39.424 --> 22:42.293
And I've already told him that
he's not aIlowed to touch the piano

22:42.461 --> 22:44.462
he isn't, is he. m u m my?

22:45.464 --> 22:47.665
So. you've spoken to his father as well?

22:47.833 --> 22:49.200
No, only with Victor.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.001
His father is with the others
in the halI.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.904
But I've just come from the hall
there's no one there.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.707
They m ust have gone upstairs.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.276
They're viewing the house.
That'll do, Anne.

22:59.444 --> 23:01.145
That's enough.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.280
Now, why were you crying?

23:03.448 --> 23:04.315
It was Victor.

23:04.483 --> 23:05.549
So where is he now?

23:05.717 --> 23:06.684
He went out through there.

23:06.852 --> 23:10.221
Would you mind telling me how a boy
can get in and out of this room

23:10.389 --> 23:11.789
if it's locked . . . ?

23:16.294 --> 23:18.529
I thought I made myself quite clear!

23:19.398 --> 23:22.533
No door is to be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

23:22.701 --> 23:25.035
Is that so hard to understand?

23:25.470 --> 23:26.837
This house is like a ship.

23:27.005 --> 23:29.006
The light m ust be contained as
if it were water

23:29.174 --> 23:32.042
by opening and closing the doors.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.245
My children's lives are at stake!

23:34.413 --> 23:35.045
But, ma'am. I . . .

23:35.213 --> 23:37.381
Do not argue with me! Be quiet!

23:38.216 --> 23:40.818
Now which was the last of you
to enter that room ?

23:41.586 --> 23:43.020
Lydia?

23:45.157 --> 23:47.658
She hasn't got a key
I already told you that.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.093
Well. that leaves you, then.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.395
But, I was in the hall the whole time.

23:51.563 --> 23:52.730
And then I went out into the garden.

23:52.898 --> 23:54.031
You saw me with your own eyes.

23:54.199 --> 23:56.634
I hope you are not suggesting
that was me!

23:57.936 --> 24:00.304
Do you think that l would overlook such
a thing and endanger the Iife

24:00.472 --> 24:02.506
of my own daughter?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.782
You're not supposed to
read at the table.

24:12.751 --> 24:16.854
Oh really? And who is going
to tell m u m my . . . you?

24:19.624 --> 24:21.459
Or perhaps . . . you?

24:27.532 --> 24:29.533
Did you really see a boy?

24:30.569 --> 24:32.470
Yes, he's called Victor.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.273
Is he a ghost?

24:36.441 --> 24:37.174
Don't be stupid.

24:37.342 --> 24:39.276
G hosts aren't like that.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.078
What are they like?

24:41.246 --> 24:43.180
I've told you a thousand times.

24:43.348 --> 24:46.283
They go about in white sheets
and carry chains.

24:46.451 --> 24:47.418
How do you know?

24:47.586 --> 24:49.119
Because l've seen them .

24:49.287 --> 24:51.255
They come out at night.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.824
Fibber! Where?

25:00.732 --> 25:01.665
You're stupid.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.434
Not half as m uch as you.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.603
Well. I don't believe you saw that boy.

25:05.770 --> 25:06.704
Believe what you like.

25:06.872 --> 25:09.273
You'll soon be begging
us to play with you.

25:22.387 --> 25:24.755
Nicholas. Nicholas.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.658
What?

25:27.859 --> 25:29.226
Look.

25:30.328 --> 25:31.929
Why have you opened the curtains?

25:32.097 --> 25:33.197
It wasn't me.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.632
Who was it then?

25:34.799 --> 25:36.433
It was Victor.

25:36.601 --> 25:39.069
He's been doing it all night.

25:39.404 --> 25:40.938
You're a liar. I'm going to tell m u m my.

25:41.106 --> 25:42.473
So I'm a liar, a m I?

25:42.641 --> 25:43.974
Yes.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.777
Victor, come out from
behind that curtain so my

25:46.945 --> 25:48.812
stupid brother can see you.

25:58.657 --> 25:59.957
Leave me alone.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.259
So you don't want to see him now, eh?

26:02.427 --> 26:05.496
You're a cowardly custard. . . . cowardly
cowardly custard . . .

26:05.664 --> 26:07.831
cowardly, cowardly custard

26:09.601 --> 26:12.136
Well. I'll just have to
do it myself, then.

26:29.788 --> 26:31.422
That's enough, Victor. . .

26:34.292 --> 26:36.093
Nicholas. Nicholas.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.595
Tell him to leave the curtains alone.

26:37.762 --> 26:38.762
He won't listen to me.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.998
Stop it! Get off my bed, both of you!

26:41.166 --> 26:42.833
This is our bed.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.735
No, it's mine.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.838
Anne, please stop putting on that voice.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.240
You be quiet, cowardly custard.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.509
Listen, if you don't stop

26:52.677 --> 26:55.412
I'll call my mother and
she'll kick you out.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.314
You don't know my mother!

26:57.482 --> 26:59.283
And you don't know my parents.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.186
Anne, I'm going to tell m u m my about you.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.055
Don't be stupid! Can't you see
it's not me . . . ?

27:05.957 --> 27:08.492
Victor, touch his cheek so
he knows you're real.

27:20.338 --> 27:21.338
Help! M u m my!

27:21.506 --> 27:22.239
Help!

27:22.407 --> 27:24.375
M u m my! M u m my!

27:24.542 --> 27:25.643
What is it?.
Help!

27:25.810 --> 27:27.511
M u m my!
What is it?

27:29.280 --> 27:29.880
What is it?

27:30.048 --> 27:33.784
She was frightening me and
I told her to be quiet and . . .

27:33.952 --> 27:36.220
I'm fed up! Do you hear me?

27:36.388 --> 27:37.621
I am fed up with you!

27:37.789 --> 27:40.057
I didn't do anything!

27:43.261 --> 27:48.098
"Therefore the Lord God sent him
forth from the garden of Eden

27:48.266 --> 27:50.801
to till the ground from
whence he was taken.

27:50.969 --> 27:54.638
so he drove out the man
and placed at the east of the garden

27:54.806 --> 27:58.676
of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword
which turned every way

27:58.843 --> 28:01.211
to keep the way of the
tree of life."

28:01.379 --> 28:03.747
There! I've finished.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.784
Very good.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.689
Now you can ask the
Virgin for forgiveness.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.825
What!? That's not what we agreed.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.894
We didn't agree anything, young lady.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.530
Today you're being punished
and you'lI do as I say.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.999
You can't make me ask the
Virgin for forgiveness.

28:22.167 --> 28:22.966
How dare you!?

28:23.134 --> 28:26.236
M u m my, I won't ask forgiveness
for something I didn't do.

28:26.404 --> 28:28.639
You told your brother that there
was someone else in the room!

28:28.807 --> 28:29.306
There was!

28:29.474 --> 28:30.040
You're lying!

28:30.208 --> 28:31.608
I am not!

28:33.344 --> 28:38.816
Anne, Anne. do you re mem ber the story
about Justus and Pastor?

28:39.150 --> 28:42.252
Children who don't tell the truth
end up in Lim bo.

28:42.587 --> 28:43.754
That's what you say.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.356
But I read the other day that Lim bo
is only for children

28:46.524 --> 28:48.726
who haven't been baptised.

28:49.094 --> 28:50.794
And I have.

28:52.697 --> 28:55.599
"And Abraham took the
wood of the burnt offering

28:55.767 --> 29:01.004
and laid it upon Isaac his son
and he took the fire in his hand,..."

29:01.172 --> 29:04.842
" . . . and a knife
and they went both of them together"

29:05.009 --> 29:08.345
" . . . And lsaac speak unto Abraham
his father, and said,

29:08.513 --> 29:11.882
My father: and he said
Here am I my son.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.350
And he..."

29:28.600 --> 29:30.134
Did you look in on Nicholas?

29:30.301 --> 29:34.571
Yes ma'am, the little angel
is fast asleep.

29:35.206 --> 29:38.475
What about Anne? Is she
still on the stairs ?

29:38.843 --> 29:40.144
Oh yes, ma'am.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.813
I'd prefer to have her where
I can see her

29:42.981 --> 29:45.716
but I can't em broider
in such poor light.

29:49.554 --> 29:51.121
How long is this punish ment
going to go on?

29:51.289 --> 29:53.157
It's been three days now.

29:53.491 --> 29:55.058
It's up to her.

29:56.961 --> 30:00.497
She's got to learn to swallow her pride
and ask for forgiveness.

30:01.499 --> 30:04.001
Anyway, it's about time she started
to read the Bible.

30:05.103 --> 30:08.372
Well. the priest will be very pleased
to hear that ma'a m.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.340
lf he ever deigns to pay us
another visit.

30:10.508 --> 30:12.743
He knows perfectly well that
the chiIdren can't go out.

30:12.911 --> 30:16.480
Oh he told me yesterday he'd be by
as soon as possible.

30:17.015 --> 30:20.317
H m m. l'm beginning to feel totally
cut off from the world.

30:22.353 --> 30:23.720
And this fog doesn't exactly help.

30:23.888 --> 30:25.689
It's never lasted this long before.

30:25.857 --> 30:27.624
Well. that's true, ma'a m .

30:27.859 --> 30:30.093
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.064
Anne!

30:35.099 --> 30:37.000
Anne, I can't hear you!

30:37.936 --> 30:41.972
"...and Isaac speak unto Abraha m
his father, and said, My father..."

30:42.140 --> 30:45.075
Incidentally Mrs. Mills, l've had to
put up with the noise of Lydia

30:45.243 --> 30:46.376
running around above my head.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.679
Sh . . . . she's been hurtling backwards
and forwards as if there were

30:48.847 --> 30:50.247
three of her up there.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.317
Would you kindly tell her that it's not
necessary to kick up quite such a ru m pus

30:53.484 --> 30:55.185
just to do a little cleaning.

30:55.753 --> 30:57.855
I couldn't bare to get
another migraine attack.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.623
I'll tell her. ma'am.

31:00.558 --> 31:01.825
Thank you.

31:02.760 --> 31:07.464
" . . . behold the fire and the wood:
but where is the lam b . . . "

31:48.506 --> 31:50.407
Now she's really gone too far. . .

31:50.842 --> 31:53.243
Lydia! Lydia!

32:17.135 --> 32:18.368
" . . . and the angel of Yave..."

32:18.536 --> 32:19.670
What's going on up there?

32:19.837 --> 32:20.437
Nothing. m u m my.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.506
I'm just reading. like you told me.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.541
Did you hear it as well?

32:24.709 --> 32:26.143
Hear what?

32:30.782 --> 32:33.617
"And the angel of the Lord called
unto Abraham out of

32:33.785 --> 32:36.353
heaven the second time, and said:

32:36.521 --> 32:38.655
'By myself have I sworn
saith the Lord, . . . "'

32:38.823 --> 32:40.057
Shhh!

32:50.635 --> 32:51.702
What was that?

32:51.869 --> 32:53.236
I don't know.

32:53.738 --> 32:56.406
Anne, tell me who's making that noise?

32:56.574 --> 32:58.442
I can't tell you, m u m my.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.010
You tell me!

33:00.178 --> 33:04.014
I told you there was someone in
the room and you punished me!

33:04.182 --> 33:05.515
Now I don't know what to say!

33:05.683 --> 33:07.517
Anne, I want the truth!

33:09.187 --> 33:11.688
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.926
There. In that junk room .

34:05.510 --> 34:07.878
M u m my, you're letting the light in!

35:00.465 --> 35:04.334
She's here. she's here . . .

35:04.502 --> 35:07.170
M u m my, she says she's here.

35:08.039 --> 35:11.174
She's watching us . . . she's watching us!

35:34.665 --> 35:35.499
Where did they go?

35:35.666 --> 35:36.800
They just ca me past here.

35:36.968 --> 35:37.968
Didn't you see them?

35:38.136 --> 35:39.536
Which way did they go?

35:39.737 --> 35:42.772
Over there, over there . . . oh
and down there. as well.

35:49.113 --> 35:51.915
They're everywhere.
They say the house is theirs.

35:52.884 --> 35:55.919
And they say they're going to
take the curtains down as well.

35:58.122 --> 36:01.057
M a'a m, stay calm please.
I will not stay calm!

36:01.225 --> 36:03.460
For five whole years during
the occupation, I managed to avoid

36:03.628 --> 36:05.362
a single Nazi ever stepping foot
in this house!

36:05.530 --> 36:06.796
And now there is someone here
under my nose

36:06.964 --> 36:09.132
opening and closing the doors!

36:09.300 --> 36:11.835
M a'a m, this is a very old house.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.437
Why. the floorboards squeak
and the plu m bing clanks, and . . .

36:14.605 --> 36:15.906
There were voices. I'm telling you.

36:16.073 --> 36:17.741
M u m my, look.
A boy and two women.

36:17.909 --> 36:18.708
And they were talking together.

36:18.876 --> 36:20.644
M u m my . . . m u m my look.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.247
I did it yesterday.

36:24.582 --> 36:28.285
This is the father, this is the mother
this is Victor

36:28.452 --> 36:29.786
and this is the old woman.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.888
What do these nu m bers stand for?

36:32.089 --> 36:34.324
That's the nu m ber of times
I've seen them.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.893
I see the old woman the most.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.666
Oh. God in Heaven!

36:43.067 --> 36:44.234
Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr. Tuttle.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.736
Tell him we have to search
the whole house, im mediately

36:46.904 --> 36:47.704
before it gets dark.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.172
Yes, ma'a m . . . There now . . .

36:49.340 --> 36:50.807
M u m my . . .
Yes darling.

36:50.975 --> 36:53.877
lt's all right, nothing's going to
happen to you while m u m my's here.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.814
Look m u m my, she really scares me.

36:57.982 --> 37:00.784
It's as if she's not looking at you
but she can see you.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.853
And she's always around, saying:
Coooome with meee . . .

37:04.021 --> 37:05.322
Oh Anne. don't lie to me!

37:05.489 --> 37:06.489
Honestly, m u m my.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.158
And she asks me things.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.560
Victor told me she's a witch.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.195
What does she ask you?

37:12.363 --> 37:13.997
Things.

37:16.133 --> 37:17.968
Her breath smells.

37:21.672 --> 37:23.907
We have to open all the curtains.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.142
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

37:26.310 --> 37:26.776
Yes, ma'a m.

37:26.944 --> 37:29.679
You both search the right side and
I'll take the left.

37:29.847 --> 37:31.548
Then we'll search upstairs.

38:42.853 --> 38:46.723
"Perhaps they are ghosts who lived
in this house before and who . . . "

38:46.891 --> 38:47.791
Don't be stupid.

38:47.958 --> 38:50.627
I've already told you
ghosts go about in white sheets

38:50.795 --> 38:53.530
and carry chains and go . . . "ooO O Oooo!".

38:54.098 --> 38:57.467
Anne, why do you make up such stories?

38:57.635 --> 38:59.703
I don't. I read them in books..

38:59.870 --> 39:02.939
Well. you shouldn't believe everything
that you read in books.

39:03.107 --> 39:06.376
That's what our mother says . . .
she says that aIl this stuff

39:06.544 --> 39:07.911
about ghosts is rubbish.

39:08.079 --> 39:12.115
And then she expects us to believe
everything written in the Bible.

39:12.283 --> 39:13.650
And don't you believe it?

39:13.818 --> 39:15.151
I believe some things . . .

39:15.319 --> 39:19.989
But, for exa m ple, I don't believe that
God made the world in seven days.

39:20.157 --> 39:24.361
And I don't believe that Noah got
aIl those animals into one boat.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.596
Or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

39:26.764 --> 39:28.865
No, I don't believe that either.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.667
Doves are anything but holy.

39:30.835 --> 39:32.836
They pooh on our windows.

39:38.409 --> 39:42.545
Have you mentioned any of
this to your mother?

40:48.112 --> 40:49.446
Eh m . . . ma'am . . .

40:49.880 --> 40:51.214
Yes . . . ?

40:52.116 --> 40:53.850
They've searched everywhere ma'am.

40:54.151 --> 40:55.351
There's no one.

40:55.519 --> 40:56.820
I see.

40:59.256 --> 41:00.490
Mrs. Mills?

41:02.326 --> 41:03.626
Yes ma'am?

41:04.295 --> 41:06.429
Do you have any idea what this might be?

41:08.799 --> 41:09.999
Oh. it is a photograph albu m, ma'am.

41:10.167 --> 41:13.169
No but look, they're all asleep. Look.

41:14.104 --> 41:16.539
They're not asleep, ma'a m . . . They're dead.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.043
It's a book of the dead.

41:20.377 --> 41:21.377
In the last century.

41:21.545 --> 41:24.547
I believe they used to take photographs
of the dead in the hopes

41:24.715 --> 41:28.918
that their souls would go on living
through the portraits.

41:31.755 --> 41:36.526
There are even group portraits . . .
Ah! . . . And children!

41:36.694 --> 41:37.694
Ahh . . .

41:37.862 --> 41:39.429
It's macabre.

41:41.532 --> 41:44.200
How could these people
be so superstitious?

41:45.035 --> 41:48.071
Grief over the death of
a loved one can lead people

41:48.239 --> 41:50.673
to do the strangest things.

41:54.111 --> 41:55.111
Get rid of it.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.146
I don't want it in the house.

41:57.314 --> 41:58.815
Yes ma'am.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.061
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.

42:12.229 --> 42:14.230
Why don't you come and sit by the fire.

42:26.844 --> 42:28.811
Thank you very m uch. ma'am.

42:29.747 --> 42:32.615
So. tell me about when you
worked here before.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.618
Did you have to look after
children then as well?

42:35.786 --> 42:40.156
No. I was in charge of
organising the housework.

42:41.425 --> 42:43.026
Were there many servants?

42:43.294 --> 42:45.395
Oh. about fifteen.

42:46.897 --> 42:49.999
Though in the end there were
just the three of us left.

42:50.167 --> 42:51.334
Why?

42:51.502 --> 42:53.903
My em ployers moved to London.

42:54.305 --> 42:59.776
They came here less and less
it being so out of the way like . . .

42:59.944 --> 43:04.347
And so gradually the house
just became em pty.

43:05.549 --> 43:08.217
Everybody ends up leaving
this dam ned island.

43:10.054 --> 43:14.824
My fa mily left in the su m mer of 1 940
just before the invasion . . .

43:16.694 --> 43:18.494
That was the last I ever heard of the m . . .

43:20.364 --> 43:21.564
Oh.

43:23.067 --> 43:24.601
I don't blame them .

43:26.136 --> 43:28.638
Actually, we left, too.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.643
Although . . . you know sometimes
when you Ieave a pIace

43:33.811 --> 43:38.047
it's like it's there with you
all the time.

43:38.215 --> 43:41.284
I always felt like l never
left this house.

43:41.552 --> 43:43.086
Why did you leave?

43:43.854 --> 43:46.289
Oh. it was on account
of the tuberculosis.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.491
The whole area was evacuated.

43:51.996 --> 43:54.030
Ah . . . was that when Lydia went du m b?

43:54.832 --> 43:57.166
Yes, l think so . . .

43:57.334 --> 44:01.137
Though you know, my memory is a bit
rusty these days ma'am.

44:01.305 --> 44:02.872
What happened to her?

44:08.746 --> 44:15.251
Well suddenly, one day
she just stopped talking.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.387
Well there m ust have been a reason . . .

44:18.822 --> 44:20.857
People don't just stop talking.

44:21.025 --> 44:24.894
These things are always the result
of some sort of trau ma . . . .

44:25.596 --> 44:27.697
Something m ust have happened to her. . .

44:31.902 --> 44:33.436
Did your em ployers treat you well?

44:33.604 --> 44:36.272
Oh. they were always very kind to us.

44:36.473 --> 44:38.741
They treated us just like family.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.713
You know ma'am. I think l will go to bed

44:43.881 --> 44:46.916
I'll never be able to get up
in the morning.

44:47.184 --> 44:48.518
Off you go.

44:49.119 --> 44:50.987
I'm going to stay here a while longer.

44:51.388 --> 44:52.689
Yes ma'am.

45:26.657 --> 45:28.991
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

45:36.867 --> 45:39.068
Can you forgive me . . . ?

45:44.641 --> 45:46.042
Anne . . .

45:49.379 --> 45:50.480
Oh . . .

46:05.529 --> 46:06.696
M u m my.

46:06.864 --> 46:08.064
What?

46:08.232 --> 46:10.233
When's daddy coming home?

46:11.301 --> 46:13.102
When the war's over.

46:13.837 --> 46:19.408
Why did he go to war. . . l mean
nobody's done anything bad to us?

46:20.711 --> 46:22.111
Daddy went. . .

46:25.415 --> 46:27.917
Daddy went because
he's very brave.

46:29.453 --> 46:34.257
And because he wasn't prepared to let
the Germans tell him what he had to do.

46:35.125 --> 46:36.692
Why?

46:44.668 --> 46:49.505
Charles . . . where are you?

49:37.708 --> 49:42.445
Mrs. Mills!!

49:43.947 --> 49:45.147
What's the matter, ma'a m?

49:45.382 --> 49:47.817
The key to the m usic room!
Give it to me!

49:48.018 --> 49:49.585
Quickly!
What's happening?

49:49.753 --> 49:50.820
Come on!

50:00.330 --> 50:01.630
Oh. my God . . . !

50:05.469 --> 50:07.636
I checked that room myself.

50:09.973 --> 50:11.340
It was e m pty.

50:12.075 --> 50:13.776
Now take these tablets, ma'a m.

50:13.944 --> 50:15.211
And yet...
They'll do you good.

50:15.379 --> 50:18.381
And yet, and yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

50:20.751 --> 50:22.451
And it wasn't hu man.

50:23.620 --> 50:28.858
There is something
in this house. something diabolic.

50:29.026 --> 50:30.259
M a'a m!

50:30.427 --> 50:36.632
Something which is not, not at rest. . .

50:41.271 --> 50:43.005
I know you don't believe it.

50:43.940 --> 50:45.508
You don't believe it, do you?

50:46.543 --> 50:47.910
No, I don't blame you.

50:48.311 --> 50:51.347
I . . . I used to not believe these things.

50:53.216 --> 50:54.850
I do believe it, ma'a m.

50:58.588 --> 51:01.057
I've always believed in those things.

51:01.591 --> 51:05.528
Oh. they're not easy to explain . . .
but they do happen.

51:05.796 --> 51:12.168
We've all heard stories of the beyond
now and then . . .

51:13.603 --> 51:15.838
And I think that, sometimes

51:16.640 --> 51:24.513
the world of the dead gets mixed up
with the world of the living.

51:25.982 --> 51:27.483
But it's im possible!

51:27.651 --> 51:29.685
The Lord would never
allow such an aberration!

51:29.853 --> 51:33.522
The living and the dead, they will only
meet at the end of eternity.

51:36.359 --> 51:37.893
It says so in the Bible.

51:38.061 --> 51:44.333
Ma'am. there isn't always
an answer for everything.

51:56.646 --> 51:58.147
Where are you off to ma'am?

51:58.715 --> 52:01.150
I'm going to the village to
pay Father Legrand a visit.

52:01.518 --> 52:03.519
lf he won't come here
then I shall go to him.

52:03.687 --> 52:04.453
And I shall bring him back.

52:04.621 --> 52:06.088
M a'a m, you should wait till
the weather im proves . . .

52:06.256 --> 52:08.023
I've waited long enough.

52:09.526 --> 52:11.093
M a'a m the priest told me . . .

52:11.261 --> 52:13.129
I don't care what he told you!

52:13.430 --> 52:15.498
I want him to tell me. personally.

52:15.665 --> 52:17.066
He m ust come today.

52:17.234 --> 52:18.734
Well. what are you going to tell him ?

52:18.902 --> 52:21.837
We have searched every room in there
inch by inch.

52:22.005 --> 52:24.039
And now I need them to be blessed.

52:26.243 --> 52:26.675
Off

52:26.843 --> 52:29.011
M a'a m, please, wait
it's still very early!

52:29.179 --> 52:30.446
Mr. Tuttle.

52:30.981 --> 52:31.814
Good morning. ma'am.

52:31.982 --> 52:34.750
I need you to search the whole
garden for gravestones.

52:34.918 --> 52:35.484
Gravestones?

52:35.652 --> 52:39.054
Yes, when my husband bought this house
we were told there was a little cemetery

52:39.322 --> 52:41.490
I think it was somewhere over there
amongst the trees.

52:41.658 --> 52:42.725
I've not seen anything.

52:42.893 --> 52:46.162
Check carefully.
They could be overgrown.

52:46.530 --> 52:47.663
Yes, ma'a m.
I need to know if there was

52:47.831 --> 52:49.665
a family buried here . . .

52:49.833 --> 52:51.901
and if they had a little boy, Victor.

53:08.018 --> 53:10.119
Now she thinks the house is haunted.

53:11.288 --> 53:13.556
Do you think it's safe to let her go?

53:14.090 --> 53:14.623
Oh. don't worry.

53:14.791 --> 53:16.959
The fog won't let her get very far.

53:17.127 --> 53:20.663
Oh. yes. the fog. The fog . . . of course.

53:21.598 --> 53:26.168
And when . . . when do you think we should
bring alI this out into the open?

53:26.503 --> 53:30.673
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle
All in good time.

53:31.274 --> 53:33.075
Speaking of which . . .

53:33.677 --> 55:24.887
Oh!

55:27.590 --> 55:29.325
Charles . . .

55:30.360 --> 55:31.827
Grace . . .

55:44.974 --> 55:47.943
You're here! You're here!

55:48.511 --> 55:50.612
They said there was no hope.

55:51.681 --> 55:53.882
They said I should give you up for dead!

55:54.551 --> 55:56.518
They say a lot of things.

55:57.020 --> 56:04.960
Oh. oh, thank you, thank you God.

56:05.462 --> 56:09.698
Thank you. Every night l've
prayed for this . . .

56:10.333 --> 56:12.568
begging God to bring you back.

56:15.171 --> 56:17.005
To bring the children their father back.

56:21.010 --> 56:23.412
But where have you been all this time?

56:24.447 --> 56:28.050
Out there, looking for my home.

56:36.059 --> 56:40.562
You're so different, so different...

56:41.164 --> 56:43.232
Sometimes l bleed.

57:21.070 --> 57:22.404
M a'a m .

57:24.707 --> 57:29.845
Mrs. Mills, this is my husband.

57:33.616 --> 57:36.318
I'm very pleased to meet you. sir.

57:36.486 --> 57:38.420
He's very weak.

57:42.425 --> 57:45.327
I want you to prepare
a hot bath and some clean clothes

57:46.162 --> 57:47.496
and something to eat.

57:47.664 --> 57:49.331
Right away, ma'a m.

58:08.885 --> 58:10.486
How are my little ones?

58:13.156 --> 58:14.223
Daddy!

58:17.560 --> 58:19.428
Why did you take so long?

58:26.336 --> 58:27.970
Hello, Nicholas.

58:28.137 --> 58:30.939
I told you, you see!
I told you he'd come back.

58:38.047 --> 58:39.748
Have you both been well behaved?

58:40.116 --> 58:41.817
We've been very good.

58:41.985 --> 58:42.784
Have you been good to your mother?

58:42.952 --> 58:46.955
Very good. We study everyday
for our First Com m union.

58:47.991 --> 58:49.658
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

58:56.232 --> 58:58.333
Oh. here he comes.

59:02.138 --> 59:05.274
Darling, we've prepared lunch for you.

59:06.042 --> 59:08.443
Are you coming down or would
you prefer that. . . ?

59:20.723 --> 59:22.090
When's daddy coming down?

59:22.258 --> 59:26.461
Be patient Anne, Daddy is not well.

59:26.629 --> 59:28.597
He said he's seen lots of dead men.

59:28.765 --> 59:30.098
Ssshh . . .

59:33.536 --> 59:37.139
M u m my, when people die in the war
where do they go?

59:37.307 --> 59:40.809
Ah. what a question! It depends.

59:41.844 --> 59:42.678
On what?

59:42.845 --> 59:47.015
Well . . . on whether they fought on the side
of the "goodies" or the "baddies".

59:47.216 --> 59:49.251
Your father, for exam ple
fought for EngIand

59:49.419 --> 59:51.019
on the side of the "goodies".

59:53.656 --> 59:56.158
How do you know who the "goodies"
and the "baddies" are?

59:56.993 --> 59:58.760
That's enough questions. Eat your food.

59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.362
You'll never go to war.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.698
We'll never go anywhere.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.736
Oh. you're not missing anything.

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:12.674
You're m uch better at home with m u m my
and daddy, who love you very, very m uch.

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.178
And the intruders.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.715
There are no intruders here.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.817
But you said that there were.

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.518
No, I said that there are
no intruders here.

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.487
And I don't want to hear another
word on the subject.

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:26.188
But you said . . .

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.990
No, that is enough!

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.258
Can l say something?

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:30.892
No!

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:31.727
Why not?!

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:34.296
Because . . . because you can't!

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:43.038
Anne, stop breathing like that.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.808
You heard me. Stop it!

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:52.014
Stop breathing!

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:56.618
Right, you go to your room.
Go to your room .

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.820
There's no dessert for you today.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:06.428
Oh no crying now . . .

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:10.399
No crying . . . Oh, stop that. . . here.

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:13.435
Oh. look what an awful face
you've got when you cry!

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:14.903
I don't care!

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:19.207
There. there . . . You listen to me.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.311
I've seen them, too.

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:25.747
You have?

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.516
Yes.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.251
Then why don't you tell my mother.

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.786
Then maybe she'll believe me.

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:34.289
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:37.325
She only believes in what she was taught

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.194
But don't worry.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:43.799
Sooner or later, she'll see them.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.835
And then everything will be different.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.603
How?

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:55.310
Oh. you'll see . . . there are going to
be some big surprises.

01:01:55.778 --> 01:02:00.015
There are going to be . . . changes.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.517
Changes . . .

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:17.099
Now she is behaving as
if nothing had happened.

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:20.235
What about her daughter?

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:22.571
Oh. she's not so stubborn.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.407
The children will be easier to convince.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:29.544
No it's the mother
who is going to cause us problems.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.282
Do you think her
husband suspects anything?

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:39.855
No, I don't think he even knows
where he is.

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:58.273
Oh. look what a pretty
daughter I've got.

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:05.380
M u m my made this veil
especially for you, h m n?

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.282
I look like a bride.

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.853
Yes you do.

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:18.860
Now I need to shorten
the sleeves a Iittle.

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:20.462
You can take it off now.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.129
Nooo . . .

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.198
Anne, this dress has to be spotless
for your First Com m union.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.300
I promise l won't dirty it.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.202
Just let me wear it for a little longer.

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:28.069
Just a little.

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:30.305
Oh. just a little . . .

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.707
All right.

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:35.210
I'll be back shortly.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.846
No sitting on the floor.
No leaning against the walls!

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:39.281
No.

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:58.366
M onsieur. would you like to dance . . . ?

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:03.205
I'd love to.

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:27.829
Charles, you can't go on like this.

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:29.931
You m ust eat something.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:37.439
Oh . . . oo . . . oo . . .

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:53.388
"In the sky...

01:04:56.025 --> 01:05:08.637
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
because I only have eyes for you...

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:14.910
dear... the moon may be high..."

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.811
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now..

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:55.650
Anne, are you listening to me?

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.521
Anne . . . ?!

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:06.561
What did l tell you about
sitting on the floor?

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:07.629
But it's clean.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:08.897
It makes no difference.

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:11.399
Why can't you ever do as you're told?

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.325
What's the matter?

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.427
Where is my daughter?

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:44.899
What have you done with my daughter?!

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:49.237
Are you mad? I am your daughter.

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:52.073
No! You're not my daughter!

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:55.076
No!

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:58.947
No! You're not my daughter!

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:03.618
No! No! No! No! No!

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.330
M a'a m, I heard shouts . . .

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:16.965
She wants to kill me!

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:19.067
She won't stop until she kills us!

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:21.403
She won't stop! She won't stop
until she kills us!

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:22.537
H ush. H ush child. Come with me.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.104
Come with me.

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:27.876
You're wicked! You're wicked! Wicked!

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.255
How is she?

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:44.893
There's no calming her
so I've left her with her father.

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.762
She insisted on speaking with him.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:54.602
What happened? Why did you fight?

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.404
It wasn't her.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:08:00.375
It was the old woman
with the strange eyes.

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:02.710
She was imitating my daughter's voice.

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:06.147
I'd swear to God that
it wasn't my daughter.

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:13.354
Oh God. God help me. God help me.

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:15.290
What's the matter with me.

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.859
I don't know what's the matter with me.

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:21.196
You m ust get more rest.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:27.836
You can't take on all the responsibility
of this house.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:32.006
Leave it to us. We know
what has to be done.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.944
What do you mean by that?

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.648
What do you mean you know
what has to be done?

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.450
Nothing. ma'am. I was just suggesting . . .

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.385
There's nothing to suggest!

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:46.787
Who do you think you are!

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.189
You have no idea what has to be done!

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:55.497
Or do you?

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.401
What are these?

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:06.040
The tablets for your migraine. ma'am.

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:09.176
The ones you always take.

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:12.412
Please, I need to be on my own.

01:09:13.948 --> 01:09:15.483
Yes, ma'a m.

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:40.475
Come on child.

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.099
Anne told me everything.

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:14.709
I wish I had an explanation
but I haven't.

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:17.312
At first, l thought there was
someone else in the house.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:19.013
I even thought that there were ghosts.

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.649
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:25.186
l'm talking about
what happened that day.

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:33.828
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:35.763
Tell me is not true.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.032
Tell me what happened.

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.002
Happened . . . ?

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:49.444
l don't know
what came over me that day.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:53.648
I...The servants had
left during the night.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.718
They hadn't the courage to tell me
to my face . . .

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:04.759
and they knew that I couldn't
leave the house.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.328
They knew.

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:16.137
Anne . . . Anne, what happened?

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:23.811
She hit me. She went mad . . .
like she did that day.

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:25.747
Do you remem ber?

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:28.750
No.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.820
You m ust forgive me Charles.

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:38.426
Not me...the children.

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:40.962
They know that l love them.

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.398
They know I'd never hurt them . . .

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:46.501
I . . . I'd die first. . .

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.472
What are you going to do?

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.109
Are you angry with me?

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:02.250
I just to came back to say goodbye
to my wife and children.

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:04.452
Now I m ust go.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.721
Go where?

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.290
To the front.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.059
The war's over.

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:15.863
The war is not over.
What are you talking about?!

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:19.067
You're not going, do you hear me?

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:22.203
You left us once already. You can't go!

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:27.942
Why? Why did you have to go to that
stupid war that had nothing

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.877
to do with us . . . ?

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:33.214
Why couldn't you have stayed here
like the others did?

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:33.981
The others surrendered.

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.117
We all surrendered!

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.119
The whole island was occupied!

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:41.956
What. . . What did you expect?

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:49.897
What were you trying
to prove by going to war?

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:55.970
Your place was here, with us
with your fa mily!

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:11.886
I loved you and that was enough for me
living in this darkness . . .

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.922
In this prison . . .

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:23.664
but not for you
I wasn't enough for you.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:31.239
That's why you left
it wasn't just the war.

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:37.178
You want to leave me. don't you?

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.831
Forgive me. Grace

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:47.875
Anne!! Nicholas!!

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:08.429
Oh my God . . . Wait!

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:09.730
Oh. my God . . . !

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:13.534
No! Ah! No!

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:31.953
Where are the curtains?!

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:39.026
Mrs. Mills!

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:49.103
Oh! . . .

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:56.544
Let me see. Let me see.

01:16:57.346 --> 01:17:00.214
Are you alright? You're alright.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.016
I want my daddy.

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.223
Daddy's gone!

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.092
It's not true!

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:15.930
Yes it is! It is true.

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:20.301
I love you m u m my.

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.411
Find the curtains.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.448
Who was it?!

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.550
Who did this?

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:39.954
Tell me! Tell me!

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.391
You know what's happening here . . .

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:45.893
You know because
it happened to you. too!

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.361
Now tell me!

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:50.965
Write it down. Write it down.

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:52.133
Please. Please.

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.569
That attitude won't
solve anything. ma'am.

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:58.305
And anyway she can't write.

01:17:58.473 --> 01:17:59.373
Where are they?

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.207
What?

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.043
The curtains!

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.278
The curtains my children's
lives depend on!

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.013
Someone has taken the curtains!

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:10.317
I have noticed ma'am, there's
no need for you to raise your voice . . .

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:14.722
Oh. Mr. Tuttle, l was just on
the point of calling you.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:18.526
Did you know someone's
taken all the curtains?

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:20.961
The curtains?

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.431
Oh. dear. . .

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:27.768
Why should anyone want to
take all the curtains?

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:32.073
Oh, to let some daylight
into this house. I imagine.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.142
Daylight. . . of course.

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:36.877
Someone wants to kill my children!

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:40.881
Now, why do you think the daylight
would kill the m ?

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:45.419
Are you mad? I told you.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:49.023
I already told you, the children
are photosensitive!

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:51.058
The light will kill them.

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.861
Yes, but that was before.

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:56.664
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:59.166
I mean. if you never expose them
to the daylight

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:01.635
how do you know they're not cured?

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:05.906
My sister-in-law used to get
terrible attacks of rheu matism

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:08.175
in her legs and back . . .

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:14.081
Then one fine day . . . they disappeared.

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:18.719
I'm going to find those curtains
and when you have finished

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.522
helping me hang them
you will leave this house.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.571
What about the master ma'am?

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:40.007
What does he have to say about all this?

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:42.476
Give me your keys.

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:45.112
I want the keys now.

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.851
I know what you want.

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.053
You want to frighten us.

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:54.555
You want to get us out
me and my chiIdren.

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:58.025
You've wanted to take over this house
ever since the first day you arrived . . .

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:00.795
Now, you give me those keys.

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.429
I will not ask again.

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:04.298
You should try and calm down, ma'am.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:10.104
Give me the keys! Give them to me!

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.145
And now, get out of here.

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.199
You know something, Mr. Tuttle . . . ?

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:42.136
I think I've reached
the end of my tether. . .

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.871
What about you?

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:48.042
Oh. yes. . . . definitely.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:52.446
We'd better go and
uncover the gravestones.

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:33.287
What's m u m my doing?

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.489
I've already told you. she's gone mad.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:36.490
Liar.

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:37.358
She's gone mad.

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:38.459
Liar. liar. . .

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:41.829
She's gone mad. she's gone mad!...
Liar! Liar! Liar!!

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:48.836
Night time.

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:51.972
Where are you going?

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.574
I've had enough.

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.478
I'm going to the woods
to look for daddy.

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:59.647
Are you going to run away?

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:04.952
lf I hang on to the pipe
I can clim b down to the ground.

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:06.954
It's very easy.

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:23.604
lf m u m my finds out, you're in for it.

01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:27.074
Yes, yes, yes . . .

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:36.650
Anne, wait!!

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.620
I want to come and look for daddy, too.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:43.023
Liar. you just don't want to be left
on your own . . .

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:44.391
scaredypants, scaredypants . . .

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:45.926
Be quiet!!

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:42.049
Anne, I think we've gotten lost.

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:44.685
We still haven't left
the garden yet, silly.

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:46.754
I'm scared.

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:48.622
You shouldn't have come, then.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.861
Say something.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:55.763
What shall l say?

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:58.065
I don't know. Anything.

01:23:58.233 --> 01:24:00.768
Let's see . . . my na me's Anne
and I'm walking.

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:03.303
I'm walking and my na me is Anne . . .

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.999
What's that over there?

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.003
I think they're graves.

01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:38.906
Don't go near.

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:40.607
Why not?

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:42.709
What if a ghost ju m ps out?

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:45.946
Graves don't have ghosts.
Only skeletons.

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:04.731
There's something written here.

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:05.799
Let's go.

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:07.401
Wait.

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:33.694
Anne, what does it say?

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:43.337
You m ust be strong now, children.

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:45.239
Nicholas. come here!

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:49.376
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell
m u m my we've run away.

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:51.211
Don't speak to them!

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:52.679
Why?

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.214
They're dead.

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:55.115
What?

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:57.484
They're ghosts. please come here!

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.486
Children. we . . . !

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.288
Nicholas!

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:06.160
lf they're ghosts. why aren't they
wearing sheets and clanking chains?

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.028
You said that. . .
I don't care what I said!

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:09.463
Get away from them!

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:13.834
You're always teasing me
and telIing Iies. and I'm sick of it.

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:15.035
I'm not teasing you!

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:18.172
I'm telling the truth! Come here!!

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.075
Quick.

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.145
No!

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.081
Children!

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:38.392
Run! Run! Go! Run!

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.960
Into the house . . .

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:45.999
Don't come any closer! Don't move!

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:53.540
Don't trouble yourself. ma'am.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:58.845
Tuberculosis finished us off. . .
more than half a century ago.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.634
Go away!

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.375
Open the door ma'am, please.

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:29.676
What do you want?

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:32.846
M u m my, don't open the door. don't. . .

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.715
We've seen their graves.

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:37.384
Go upstairs and hide . . . Go on!

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:39.186
I'm scared . . .

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.693
Don't separate.

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:53.767
Anne, oh.

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:56.403
Whatever you do don't separate.

01:27:58.006 --> 01:28:01.208
Go hide. Go! Go!

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.311
We 've been trying to
make you understand . . .

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:08.682
U nderstand what?

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:13.153
About the house . . .
about the new situation.

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:15.656
What situation?

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:21.962
We m ust all learn to live together. . .
the living and the dead.

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:26.566
lf you're dead, leave us in peace!

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:32.306
Leave us in peace!

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.746
Come here. Get inside.

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:49.756
And suppose we do leave you
do you think they will?

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:51.358
Who?

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:53.193
The intruders.

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:55.228
There are no intruders
there are no intruders . . .

01:28:55.396 --> 01:29:00.534
They took the curtains down
oh. yes. I assure you it was them.

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:05.505
And now they're in there
with you and the children.

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:06.773
Waiting for you!

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:07.474
Nooo!!!

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:14.181
Yeees!! And believe me
sooner or later they'll find you . . . .

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.383
Listen. wait here and
I'lI be back in a minute . . .

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.250
No, no, no . . . !

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:19.386
M u m my said we shouldn't separate.

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:22.255
I can't leave her on her own!

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:28.395
Stop breathing like that.

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:38.271
Nicholas. stop breathing like that.

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:42.809
Stop breathing!

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.147
Can't you hear it?

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.082
There's someone there.

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:57.858
Come with us . . .

01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:00.794
children.

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.566
Nicholas . . . ?

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.203
Anne . . . ?

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:14.408
Where are you . . . ?

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:18.945
Answer me!

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.814
The intruders have found them.

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:23.216
There's nothing we can do now.

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:27.788
You'll have to go upstairs
and talk to them.

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:50.777
Our Father, who art in heaven
hallowed be Thy name

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:53.046
Thy kingdom come.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:56.983
Thy will be done on earth as
it is in heaven.

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:02.289
Give us this day our daily bread and
forgive us our trespasses . . .

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:07.527
Why are you afraid children?

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:11.531
Why don't you want us
to be your friends?

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:19.272
Come on, speak to us. speak to us.

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:27.047
Tell me what happened?

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:31.184
Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:35.121
"Don't tell her."

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:38.859
lf I tell her
they'll Ieave us in peace.

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:42.229
M u m my!

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:45.499
"M u m my."

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:48.869
Why are you crying, children?

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:52.239
What happened in this room?

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:56.042
What did your mother do to you?

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:10.390
Something about a pillow . . .

01:32:10.925 --> 01:32:13.593
Is that how she killed you?

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:16.530
With a pillow?

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.031
She didn't kill us.

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:22.602
Children. if you're dead
why do you remain in this house?

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:24.771
We're not dead!

01:32:25.506 --> 01:32:27.641
Why do you remain in this house?

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:31.244
We're not dead!

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:32.612
We're not dead! We're not dead!

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.146
We're not dead!

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:36.182
Why do you remain in this house?
We're not dead!

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:38.318
"We're not dead, we're not dead . . . "

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:42.789
We're not dead! We're not dead!

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:46.826
We're not dead!

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:48.361
We're not. . .

01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:50.163
. . . Dead!

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.645
Are you all right?

01:33:05.813 --> 01:33:09.950
Yes, just a bit dizzy. That's all.

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:12.819
What happened?

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:16.523
They made contact.

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.291
All three?

01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:20.694
Apparently, yes.

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:23.897
The mother and the two children.

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:26.967
Quite interesting, don't you think?

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.435
Interesting?

01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:30.370
I was scared out of my wits!

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:31.371
Darling, calm down.

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:34.975
No. So far we have handled this
matter your way.

01:33:35.142 --> 01:33:36.810
But now you listen to me.

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:39.312
We can't possibly stay in this
house any longer.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.515
It is quite clear that these beings
do not want us to live here.

01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:44.017
We don't know anything about them yet.

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:47.887
Yes, we do. We know the woman, went mad

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:51.024
smothered her two children and
then shot herself.

01:33:51.225 --> 01:33:52.759
That's quite enough.

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.227
Think of our son.

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:55.495
There's nothing wrong with Victor.

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:57.330
Yes there is!

01:33:57.498 --> 01:34:00.266
He has nightmares
he says he has seen that girl.

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:03.103
And even this lady has been
possessed by her.

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:05.872
Please, let us leave this house.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.440
All right.

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:10.610
We will leave tomorrow morning.

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:13.146
Thank God for that.

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:17.117
I'll just go and check on Victor.

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:22.222
Once again, thank you so
m uch for coming.

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:23.423
A pleasure.

01:34:23.591 --> 01:34:25.058
I hope we've been of some help.

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:28.028
Oh yes, of course
but I ad mit that was not the most

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:29.963
pleasant evening of my life.

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:31.931
I understand. However
I found it electrifying.

01:34:32.099 --> 01:34:39.205
At first I couldn't understand what
the piIlow was doing in my hands.

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:44.210
And why. you didn't move.

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:50.684
But then I knew . . .

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.188
It had happened . . .

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:02.862
I'd killed my children . . .

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:10.503
I got the rifle

01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:14.708
I put it to my forehead

01:35:18.946 --> 01:35:20.613
and I pulled the trigger . . .

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:27.087
Nothing . . .

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:37.263
And then I heard your
laughter in the bedroom.

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:45.705
Ah. you were playing with the pillows
as if nothing had happened.

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:54.380
And I thought, ah . . . the Lord
in his great mercy.

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:59.486
was giving me another chance

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:09.395
telling me, "don't give up, be strong.

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:17.137
be a good mother for them ."

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:23.810
But now, ah . . .

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:33.219
what does all this mean?

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:39.425
Where are we?

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:45.632
Young Lydia asked the very same thing
when she realised the three of

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.667
us were dead.

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:51.905
And that was the last time
she ever spoke

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:56.810
but I couldn't tell you that before now.

01:37:01.715 --> 01:37:04.818
Shall I make us a nice
cup of tea, ma'am?

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:12.759
The intruders are leaving
but others will come.

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:18.198
Now, sometimes we'll sense them and
other times we won't.

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:25.471
But that's the way it's always
been . . . ma'am.

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:34.681
M u m my . . . daddy died in the war
didn't he?

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.349
Yes.

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.885
Will we ever see him again?

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:40.854
I don't know . . .

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:46.292
lf we're dead, where's Lim bo?

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:52.999
I don't know if there even is a Lim bo . . .

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:57.904
I'm no wiser than you are.

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:02.976
But I do know that I love you,

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.013
I've always loved you.

01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:12.952
And this house is ours.

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:19.459
You say with me: this house is ours . . .

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:32.572
This house is ours . . .

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:35.975
This house . . .

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:38.311
This house is ours. this house is ours

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:45.285
M u m my . . . look.

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:47.353
It doesn't hurt any more.

01:38:58.299 --> 01:39:00.767
No one can make us leave this house . . .

01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:29.262
Come along, Victor.
