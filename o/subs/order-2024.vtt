51:22.309 --> 51:26.212
and they'll tell you
that's how it works.

51:26.247 --> 51:30.684
You just have to stand there
and take it,

51:30.720 --> 51:33.721
one link at a time,

51:33.756 --> 51:37.086
one freedom at a time...

51:37.121 --> 51:39.958
[crowd murmuring]

51:39.993 --> 51:42.555
...but I won't do it.

51:42.590 --> 51:45.800
It is time for us to fight.

51:45.835 --> 51:48.461
[crowd replying louder] Yeah!

51:48.496 --> 51:49.770
My friends and family,

51:49.806 --> 51:51.072
we're here with you today

51:51.108 --> 51:54.808
because we want you to join us
on a mission,

51:54.844 --> 51:59.046
putting words into action.

51:59.081 --> 52:00.806
[scattered men replying]
Yeah! Yeah!

52:00.841 --> 52:04.718
Our brotherhood
has broken the chains

52:04.753 --> 52:06.985
of Jewish thought

52:07.020 --> 52:10.321
and parasitical usury.

52:10.356 --> 52:12.287
We've stood tall
against the coloreds

52:12.323 --> 52:14.060
who have soured our lands.

52:14.096 --> 52:16.599
We, these,
these yeoman farmers,

52:16.634 --> 52:18.162
are eating, breathing,

52:18.197 --> 52:21.670
sleeping, and growing together.

52:21.705 --> 52:23.736
They've become one mind,

52:23.771 --> 52:25.172
one body...

52:25.207 --> 52:27.607
-[crowd shouting in agreement]
-One race,

52:27.643 --> 52:28.744
one army!

52:28.779 --> 52:30.276
-[crowd shouting]
-Yeah!

52:30.312 --> 52:32.780
We're facing the extermination
of our history,

52:32.815 --> 52:36.014
of our very way of life!

52:36.049 --> 52:37.410
[crowd shouting] Yeah!

52:37.445 --> 52:38.510
Will you sit back

52:38.546 --> 52:39.348
and allow the nation

52:39.383 --> 52:41.151
that our forefathers discovered,

52:41.186 --> 52:42.986
conquered, and died for

52:43.022 --> 52:44.254
be eradicated,

52:44.289 --> 52:46.024
or will you stand up like men

52:46.059 --> 52:47.663
and fight to survive?

52:47.698 --> 52:48.653
[crowd shouting] Yeah!

52:48.689 --> 52:50.359
[Bob] Kinsmen, duty calls.

52:50.394 --> 52:53.031
It is time to take the future

52:53.067 --> 52:55.034
all your families deserve!

52:55.069 --> 52:57.830
[crowd shouting] Yes! Amen!

52:57.865 --> 53:00.871
In Metaline Falls,
we have a saying.

53:00.907 --> 53:03.740
[sighing]

53:04.977 --> 53:08.043
"Defeat...

53:08.078 --> 53:09.179
never."

53:09.215 --> 53:11.883
[crowd replying] Never...

53:11.918 --> 53:14.379
"Victory...

53:14.415 --> 53:15.218
forever."

53:15.254 --> 53:18.350
[crowd shouting] Forever!

53:18.386 --> 53:19.222
Defeat...

53:19.257 --> 53:21.496
[crowd replying] Never!

53:21.532 --> 53:22.555
Victory...

53:22.591 --> 53:23.360
[crowd replying] Forever!

53:23.395 --> 53:24.824

53:37.076 --> 53:39.180
Never! Never!

53:39.215 --> 53:43.315
[crowd chanting] White power!
White power!

53:43.350 --> 53:46.079
[chanting] White power!
White power!

53:46.114 --> 53:49.356
White power! White power!
White power! White power!

53:49.392 --> 53:51.850
[chanting] White power!
White power! White power!

53:51.886 --> 53:53.755
White power! White power!
White--

53:53.790 --> 53:57.428
[kids giggling,
banging tunelessly on piano]

53:57.463 --> 53:59.165
[Jamie] Musical chairs,
musical chairs!

53:59.201 --> 54:00.730
[Kimmy]
Wanna play musical chairs?

54:00.766 --> 54:02.037
[kids shouting excitedly]
Musical chairs! Yeah!

54:02.072 --> 54:04.106
Everybody grab a chair,
grab a chair.

54:04.141 --> 54:08.605
[kids shouting rowdily,
banging on piano]

54:08.640 --> 54:10.574
So, I've been thinking
about these guys.

54:10.610 --> 54:13.114
You know, it's obviously
not just a cash grab.

54:13.149 --> 54:15.112
There's a method
to what they're doing.

54:15.148 --> 54:16.549
You know, it's like,

54:16.584 --> 54:19.285
maybe it's building up
to something big, you know?

54:19.320 --> 54:21.284
Bombing porn theaters
and synagogues,

54:21.320 --> 54:22.784
it's organized, you know,

54:22.820 --> 54:25.093
and somebody's calling the shots
like a general--

54:25.128 --> 54:26.227
Hey, hate to break up
the pow-wow,

54:26.262 --> 54:28.061
but I think these guys
are getting hungry.

54:28.096 --> 54:29.363
Should we light up the grill?

54:29.399 --> 54:31.093
Yeah, yeah, I'll just cook
some of these hot dogs.

54:31.128 --> 54:32.565
Yeah.

54:36.569 --> 54:40.437
Must be hard
being away from yours, huh?

54:40.473 --> 54:42.070
Jamie said
you've got a daughter.

54:42.106 --> 54:43.273
Two.

54:43.308 --> 54:45.171
When are they coming up?

54:47.608 --> 54:50.118
[sighing deeply]

54:50.153 --> 54:51.553
Sorry, I wasn't trying to pry,
I just--

54:51.588 --> 54:52.651
No, no.

54:57.761 --> 54:58.791
You two are good.

54:58.826 --> 55:00.593
Yeah.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.294
How did you two meet?

55:05.329 --> 55:06.492
We met in school.

55:06.527 --> 55:09.097
Senior year.

55:09.133 --> 55:10.233
Hmm.

55:10.268 --> 55:13.669
Married, had kids.

55:13.704 --> 55:16.108
I've spent my whole life
in this house.

55:16.143 --> 55:17.810
Grandparents, parents.

55:17.845 --> 55:18.776
Yeah?

55:19.983 --> 55:24.313
It's a generational house.

55:24.349 --> 55:25.818
Lot of love in here.

55:25.853 --> 55:28.720
Yeah.

55:32.361 --> 55:36.325
There's something about
you coming in here,

55:36.360 --> 55:39.097
having these talks

55:39.132 --> 55:42.701
around the kids...

55:44.808 --> 55:46.870
I don't like that.

55:51.749 --> 55:54.174
You scare me.

55:59.918 --> 56:01.487
[Jamie calling from outside]
All right, who's hungry?

56:01.522 --> 56:03.491
[kids shouting excitedly]
Me, me, me, me!

56:08.559 --> 56:12.830
[kids squealing playfully]

56:46.102 --> 56:49.762
There's six steps in that book.

56:49.797 --> 56:53.006
Recruiting, fundraising,

56:53.041 --> 56:54.600
armed revolution,

56:54.636 --> 56:57.372
domestic terror,

56:57.408 --> 56:58.909
assassination.

57:00.481 --> 57:02.418
Number six
is "Day of the Rope."

57:03.319 --> 57:04.751
Were you gonna tell me
about this?

57:04.787 --> 57:05.786
No.

57:05.821 --> 57:07.421
Why not?

57:07.457 --> 57:09.887
Because I didn't think
you'd take me seriously.

57:11.323 --> 57:13.622
Well, I am now.

57:13.657 --> 57:16.256
[printing presses whirring]

57:25.136 --> 57:26.765
[radio host Alan Berg] See,
I just want to know what to do

57:26.801 --> 57:27.637
when I get to hell,

57:27.673 --> 57:29.208
because apparently,
as you said,

57:29.244 --> 57:30.939
all my friends are there!

57:30.975 --> 57:32.645
So I just want to know
what I'm walking into.

57:32.681 --> 57:33.876
[caller] See, there you go,
you're just a kike.

57:33.912 --> 57:35.914
You don't get it,
'cause you're just a kike.

57:35.949 --> 57:37.649
You're making fun of something
that's sacred to Christians,

57:37.684 --> 57:39.120
and you don't get it,
-[Berg] Oh, okay,

57:39.155 --> 57:40.922
that's it, make it a Jew thing.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.321
Make it about Jews.

57:42.356 --> 57:44.156
What do you know about Jews?

57:44.191 --> 57:45.425
Jews to you people

57:45.460 --> 57:47.093
is some sort of
mythological creature,

57:47.129 --> 57:48.958
some sort of beast.

57:48.993 --> 57:51.263
You don't know anything
about the Jewish people.

57:51.299 --> 57:53.898
It's just an easy target,

57:53.933 --> 57:57.933
because you're too afraid
to see what's in yourself,

57:57.968 --> 57:59.808
because you have
to have somebody to blame

57:59.844 --> 58:00.836
for your life,

58:00.871 --> 58:03.610
because you can't really
blame the people

58:03.646 --> 58:06.505
that have put you
in the position that you're in,

58:06.540 --> 58:11.320
whether it's a-a government
that doesn't care about you

58:11.355 --> 58:12.353
and has taught you
to believe otherwise,

58:12.388 --> 58:14.352
or it's something
within yourself--

58:14.387 --> 58:15.985
Step five right here.

58:16.020 --> 58:17.826
--you can't face yourself,
so it's the Jews...

58:17.862 --> 58:19.756
Let me get him.

58:19.791 --> 58:20.929
...but the one thing
you believe...

58:20.964 --> 58:22.663
Let me do it, Bob.

58:22.698 --> 58:25.930
...is that the only
really good Jew is a dead Jew,

58:25.965 --> 58:30.170
and for some reason,
you think he cares about you.

58:30.206 --> 58:32.635
I hear this all the time.

58:32.670 --> 58:34.139
People say things are dirty,

58:34.175 --> 58:35.834
things are ugly,

58:35.870 --> 58:37.478
things are changing.

58:37.514 --> 58:38.941
They don't like the new neighbor
on their street.

58:38.976 --> 58:42.315
They don't like
the new synagogue in town,

58:42.350 --> 58:44.815
and when you hear this all day,

58:44.851 --> 58:47.880
you might think
we're so filled up with hate,

58:47.916 --> 58:49.787
it's almost irreversible,

58:49.822 --> 58:52.855
but this may surprise you
coming from me,

58:52.891 --> 58:55.525
but I think people
are actually decent.

58:55.560 --> 58:57.726
That's why they call in.

58:57.761 --> 59:00.500
That's why they want to talk.

59:00.535 --> 59:02.303
They want someone
to connect with.

59:02.339 --> 59:04.834
I think people
want to give love.

59:04.869 --> 59:07.703
They want to say,
"You're all right.

59:07.738 --> 59:10.511
Let's sit, let's have a beer,"

59:10.546 --> 59:13.514
but they're afraid
they won't get it back,

59:13.550 --> 59:16.382
but I think our better instincts
will prevail,

59:16.417 --> 59:19.354
but it's got to start somewhere.

59:19.390 --> 59:23.587
So I encourage you
to do that tonight.

59:23.622 --> 59:25.050
Put something good out there,

59:25.085 --> 59:28.361
because our words, our ideas,

59:28.396 --> 59:31.089
that's what's going to live on.

59:31.124 --> 59:35.093
That's what matters, after all,

59:35.128 --> 59:38.338
and that's all for me, folks.

59:38.373 --> 59:42.042
This is Alan Berg, KOA Denver,

59:42.077 --> 59:44.406
signing off.

59:44.442 --> 59:46.615
Sayonara.

59:50.052 --> 59:51.719
[exhaling]

01:00:04.091 --> 01:00:06.426
[shots echoing into silence]

01:00:10.305 --> 01:00:12.498
[footsteps running away]

01:00:22.681 --> 01:00:26.017
[distant sirens approaching]

01:00:32.953 --> 01:00:35.163
[banging on door]

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.328
[Carney] Terry, open up.

01:00:36.363 --> 01:00:37.963
[banging on door]

01:00:39.793 --> 01:00:41.068
Fuck...

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:43.069
[Husk coughing]

01:00:43.105 --> 01:00:44.530
[sighing]

01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:48.004
Shit, you're really

01:00:48.039 --> 01:00:50.506
getting the place ready
for the family, huh?

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:52.078
[Husk sniffing]

01:00:52.113 --> 01:00:54.210
What?

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.148
Oh, you haven't heard.

01:01:01.719 --> 01:01:04.726
They murdered Alan Berg.

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:08.360
Followed him home,
shot him 12 times,

01:01:08.395 --> 01:01:11.198
34 wounds in all.

01:01:11.233 --> 01:01:14.364
What was the gun?

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.562
A MAC-10.

01:01:19.072 --> 01:01:21.908
They butchered him
like he was a fucking animal.

01:01:27.013 --> 01:01:29.712
[happy chatting and laughing,
grill sizzling]

01:01:29.747 --> 01:01:30.985
[laughing and giggling]

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:34.386
[cheering]

01:01:34.422 --> 01:01:36.157
[Bob] Hey, everyone.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.655
Uh, just want to say

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:40.185
thank you all for being here.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.662
You know, this just means a lot.

01:01:42.697 --> 01:01:44.665
When we first
moved here, this...

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:47.701
this right here,
this was the dream, you know?

01:01:47.736 --> 01:01:49.894
Kids playing, having fun,
a big family,

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:52.197
in nature.

01:01:52.232 --> 01:01:52.901
This is what it's all about,

01:01:52.936 --> 01:01:54.406
so thank you for being here.

01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:56.010
Thank you to God.

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:57.243
Um...

01:01:57.279 --> 01:01:58.570
let's have fun.

01:01:58.606 --> 01:02:02.247
-God bless you, Bob.
-[all clapping and cheering]

01:02:02.283 --> 01:02:03.114
[kissing]

01:02:04.518 --> 01:02:05.844
See that beer bottle?

01:02:05.879 --> 01:02:06.715
Yeah.

01:02:06.751 --> 01:02:08.422
Okay, now line it up

01:02:08.457 --> 01:02:10.422
through these sights, okay?

01:02:10.458 --> 01:02:12.493
Take a deep breath.

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:15.329
Keep this
right in your shoulder,

Goddamn, what are you doing?
We can't take her in.

01:13:08.745 --> 01:13:10.049
Do you know what he did
in Denver?

01:13:10.084 --> 01:13:11.083

-Jo, hey!

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:20.194
We need her here.
We keep eyes on her.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.491
I'd be careful
who I'm protecting,

01:13:21.526 --> 01:13:23.354
you dumb Nazi bitch.
-Clinton?

01:13:26.463 --> 01:13:29.261

How much they get?

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:16.267
3.6 million.

01:16:16.303 --> 01:16:17.531
What does that buy?

01:16:17.567 --> 01:16:20.465
It buys an army.

01:16:28.549 --> 01:16:30.117
Where... where are we at
with the gun?

01:16:33.145 --> 01:16:35.623
They couldn't pull any prints,

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.455
but ATF traced the serial number
to a store in Missoula.

01:16:37.491 --> 01:16:38.452
We're working on a name.
-Where?

01:16:38.488 --> 01:16:39.455

-Missoula?
-Yeah.

01:16:41.453 --> 01:16:44.121
Do you know how far
Missoula is from here?

[agent] Two and a half hours.

01:16:46.765 --> 01:16:50.631
So why the fuck
are we fucking waiting?

01:16:50.666 --> 01:16:52.563
I-I made the call.

01:16:52.598 --> 01:16:54.732

driving to Missoula, huh?

01:16:54.767 --> 01:16:56.307
Tell me.

01:17:02.515 --> 01:17:04.751
I mean, you're the fucking FBI!

01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:06.987
Got a fucking point.

01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:35.942
You know, it used to be
every day

01:17:35.977 --> 01:17:38.983
I was running home to see them.

01:17:42.519 --> 01:17:45.354
And now...

01:17:45.389 --> 01:17:46.688
this.

01:17:46.724 --> 01:17:49.059
This is all I think about.

01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:55.600
I worked organized crime.

01:17:55.636 --> 01:17:57.828
Lucchese family,
you heard of them?

01:17:57.863 --> 01:17:58.863
Mm-mm.

01:17:58.899 --> 01:18:01.540
Nasty fuckers.

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:04.542
In my last year,
I worked New York.

01:18:04.577 --> 01:18:07.204
There were two dozen murders,

01:18:07.239 --> 01:18:08.478
and I needed to get inside.

01:18:08.514 --> 01:18:11.713
I had no witnesses,

01:18:11.748 --> 01:18:13.320
so I recruit this girl,

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:16.146
this nanny of one of the bosses.

01:18:16.182 --> 01:18:18.222
She was younger than you.

01:18:18.257 --> 01:18:20.926
Smart.

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:24.897
Persuaded her to wear a wire.

01:18:26.433 --> 01:18:27.633
But I don't know, they,

01:18:27.668 --> 01:18:29.902
how they found out,
but they did...

01:18:32.604 --> 01:18:34.571
and we found her...

01:18:34.606 --> 01:18:39.043
head in the East River.

01:18:40.413 --> 01:18:42.411
Found her arms,

01:18:42.447 --> 01:18:44.719
her legs.

01:18:45.749 --> 01:18:49.185
Never found her body...

01:18:59.095 --> 01:19:01.901
...and I never got anyone
for that.

01:19:05.935 --> 01:19:08.941
Why are you telling me that?

01:19:14.646 --> 01:19:16.608
Got a name on the gun.

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:24.220

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:27.955

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:46.605
This is your daughter.

01:19:49.848 --> 01:19:51.814
I'm really sorry
she's not a boy.

She's b--
You're beautiful.

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.956
You want to hold her?

01:19:59.085 --> 01:20:00.426
It's really easy.

01:20:00.461 --> 01:20:03.062
She's sleeping, huh? Hi.

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:04.330
Hmm?

01:20:04.365 --> 01:20:05.294
She's so perfect.

01:20:10.362 --> 01:20:11.996

01:20:14.033 --> 01:20:15.769
You got her?

01:20:15.805 --> 01:20:18.444
It's okay. Hi.

01:20:18.479 --> 01:20:20.180
We gotta learn a lot.

It's all right,

01:20:28.455 --> 01:20:30.453
it's all right...

01:20:30.488 --> 01:20:32.954
Yeah.

01:20:32.989 --> 01:20:36.353

01:21:01.487 --> 01:21:03.213

but you know
where they are, right?

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:44.828
Now you're gonna fucking
tell me where they are,

01:21:44.864 --> 01:21:46.261
or I'm gonna lean on you
so hard,

you're not gonna get
off the fucking floor...

You're a tool to him.

He's using you. You're a pawn.

01:23:02.438 --> 01:23:03.634
How do you think
your friend's going to react

01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:06.310
when he finds out
you're a Mexican?

01:23:11.881 --> 01:23:14.450
Where is he?

01:23:17.956 --> 01:23:21.528
There's a number you call

if you ever got bopped.

01:23:26.296 --> 01:23:27.801
Leave a message
at the switchboard,

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:28.932
and they call back
with instructions
