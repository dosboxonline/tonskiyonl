02:49.127 --> 02:50.670
You dumb bitch.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.350
Hi. I need to check myself in.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.811
I am not feeling well.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.730
[woman] Fill these out.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.234
Uh…

03:14.235 --> 03:17.405
Oh, God. Is there--
is there any way we can expedite this?

03:17.488 --> 03:19.282
Can-- can I talk to a doctor?

03:19.782 --> 03:24.412
Here. Here's my-- here's my
insurance card and my driver's license.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.751
John, will you please?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.552
[woman sighs]

03:40.970 --> 03:44.599
[John] In your own words, describe
your current situation, as you see it.

03:46.559 --> 03:50.688
My current situation, as I see it,
is I am not well mentally.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.399
Look, there's a substantial history
in my family.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.193
[chuckles] My brother--
my brother was here.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.611
He was committed.

03:57.445 --> 04:01.115
To your knowledge, have you ever received
a diagnosis for a psychological problem?

04:01.199 --> 04:04.202
Are you just gonna read from that form?
Here, just…

04:04.285 --> 04:06.663
[sighs] Just-- j-just take this.

04:06.746 --> 04:10.833
Take this. I will pay double.
Just-- just let me in for-- for one night.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.795
Had thoughts of harming yourself?

04:13.878 --> 04:16.297
I'm having thoughts of harming you, John.

04:17.048 --> 04:21.052
I'm having thoughts of harming you
and-- and the first girl over there.

04:21.636 --> 04:25.265
We have 160 beds here and 164 patients.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.398
Here's a list of therapists in the area.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.276
What? Hey! Hey!

04:37.610 --> 04:40.905
Hey. John! John!

04:44.284 --> 04:45.451
Hey, what are you doing?

04:45.952 --> 04:48.288
What's going on? Kenny, what's going on?

04:48.371 --> 04:50.748
Sorry, Mr. Byrde. They have the paperwork.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.668
"They have the paperwork"? What paperwork?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.505
[typing]

04:57.588 --> 04:59.132
What's going on?

04:59.215 --> 05:03.553
Oh, I figured the best way was quick,
like a Band-Aid.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.346
This is a hostile takeover.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.849
But for the record,
we prefer to keep things civil.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.350
Ain't that right, Rachel?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.477
Yep. Hey, Marty.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.356
How?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.858
[inhales] When Darlene

05:16.941 --> 05:18.151
and, uh… [clears throat]

05:18.234 --> 05:20.069
…Wyatt passed on,

05:20.153 --> 05:24.115
I became the sole inheritor of all
Darlene Snell's estates and holdings.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.993
And Charles Wilkes was eager
to sell to you was how I read that.

05:27.076 --> 05:29.203
-[Ruth] Yep.
-[Rachel] He doesn't like you.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.373
Whose name is on the license?

05:40.131 --> 05:41.049
Mine.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.260
I got my record expunged.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.846
-Oh, yeah?
-[Ruth] Mm-hmm.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.307
Good for you. Look at that.

05:49.807 --> 05:50.892
[inhales]

05:50.975 --> 05:54.520
The controlling interest of this casino
needs to belong to me

05:54.604 --> 05:57.648
so that it can belong
to the Navarro cartel.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.902
Unless you're trying to get me killed
or yourselves.

06:00.985 --> 06:01.819
[laughs] Oh, please.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.364
They ain't gonna kill you
if they ain't done it by now.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.491
I do figure they'll blame you, though.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.869
[Rachel] Does seem like you should've
seen this coming after Darlene passed.

06:09.952 --> 06:13.289
All those shares
just floating around for the taking.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.500
'Course, it's none of my business.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.295
This casino is part of
a much bigger operation,

06:19.379 --> 06:20.546
and you know that, Ruth.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.007
Not anymore it ain't.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.218
Look, you're still a partner.

06:25.301 --> 06:29.347
You got ideas about the cocktail menu,
and I'll hear you out.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.808
But the controlling interest here is mine.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.394
So you need to find
another way to launder your money.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.231
Having a good time?
This is dangerous. Not a good idea.

06:38.314 --> 06:42.068
[Ruth] Good. Uh, they're taking
your shit to the storage closet upstairs.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.118
[Wendy] Of course she did.
I mean, what else can we do today?

06:50.201 --> 06:51.452
Oh, I know. Oh, I know.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.414
Maybe I'll be impaled by a tree,
and I can lose an eye,

06:54.497 --> 06:59.085
and then I can be childless and hunted
by a fucking Mexican drug cartel.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.586
And I don't know. Oh, what the fuck.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.132
I can wear a--
a patch like a fucking pirate.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.636
[hesitates] Are you all right, Wendy?
Are you, um…

07:09.720 --> 07:11.764
What, are-- are you headed to the jail?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.350
Oh, shit. Shit!

07:15.101 --> 07:17.395
No, I-I… [sighs]

07:17.478 --> 07:20.523
I'm working on something for the gala.
You're gonna have to do that alone.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.526
But you are okay?

07:24.110 --> 07:27.029
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm just--
I'm wrapped up in something.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.114
Uh, it's just, you know,

07:28.197 --> 07:30.908
remember we talked
about me helping you to the finish line?

07:30.992 --> 07:32.326
This is me helping you.

07:32.410 --> 07:36.247
I think that you should take it easy
for the next few hours. What do you think?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.626
I'm easy. I'm very easy.

07:43.254 --> 07:46.048
Okay, uh,
I will iron things out with Navarro.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.342
Good, good. You iron. I'll iron.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.886
-We'll both be ironing.
-[phone beeps]

07:50.470 --> 07:52.180
-Wendy, uh--
-[line beeps]

07:52.263 --> 07:53.181
Wendy.

07:54.098 --> 07:54.974
[phone beeps]

08:02.690 --> 08:06.444
[Omar] My lieutenants have not received
their gratitude fees. Why is that?

08:06.527 --> 08:09.822
[Marty] Yeah, I've been dealing with
a-- a family emergency. My father-in-law--

08:09.906 --> 08:11.949
An emergency
that's more urgent than mine, huh?

08:12.033 --> 08:13.034
Omar.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.536
Is everything all right?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.580
[Marty] Uh, yeah, thank you.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.249
Uh, just my-- my father-in-law
is trying to get our kids

08:20.333 --> 08:22.627
to move with him to North Carolina.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.295
Why would he do that?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.672
Yeah, he's got--
he's got an axe to grind with my wife.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.550
He-- he thinks that the kids aren't safe.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.010
You think they're safe?

08:31.511 --> 08:32.512
[Marty] You know.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.722
I don't know.

08:34.805 --> 08:38.309
-I'm sorry to hear you're going through--
-Yes, we are all sorry.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.565
Marty, I have become officially impatient.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.608
Yeah, all right.

08:45.691 --> 08:50.321
Uh, I think our best bet is
to use the horse farm and the Big Muddy

08:50.404 --> 08:52.615
so that we can get this done
as quick as we can.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.033
You will use the Missouri Belle.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.285
Why do I feel like
I am repeating myself with you?

08:56.369 --> 09:00.164
Marty, there's going to be a lot of heat
when my name gets taken off the SDN list,

09:00.248 --> 09:02.208
so your bookkeeping needs to be perfect.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.459
Sure, um…

09:03.543 --> 09:04.544
Perfect money.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.131
That's not gonna be a problem, huh?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.092
Marty, please tell me
you're not too distracted

09:11.175 --> 09:12.885
that that's gonna be a problem.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.141
No, it won't be.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.436
[line ringing]

09:27.608 --> 09:29.860
[Jim] You're gonna
wanna divorce your husband.

09:29.944 --> 09:30.778
What?

09:30.861 --> 09:34.031
You're gonna wanna
divorce your husband and marry me.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.117
I got Mary Schuler.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.913
CFO of AFL-CIO Mary Schuler?

09:41.831 --> 09:43.082
Are-- are you joking?

09:43.165 --> 09:45.084
[chuckles] No, I am not.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.963
And Richard Kaiser's PAC
had to cancel their silent auction

09:49.046 --> 09:52.133
because they were getting
too many "regretfully declines."

09:53.551 --> 09:55.678
[laughs] That is unbelievable.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.514
Yes, actually unbelievable.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.977
God, if we can pull this off,
meet this fiscal goal,

10:03.477 --> 10:07.773
get this particular group of people
to coalesce, at that point, game over.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.775
You own the Midwest.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.278
When we pull it off.

10:13.195 --> 10:16.365
God, you're a beast.
I'll be there in a bit.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.075
[phone beeps]

10:21.329 --> 10:22.455
[metal jangles]

10:23.539 --> 10:26.292
[toilet flushing]

10:39.180 --> 10:40.306
[Jonah] Don't do that.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.439
Oh, Daddy!

10:51.150 --> 10:53.069
-Get in here.
-[Wendy] What?

11:10.753 --> 11:12.254
You just don't quit.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.342
You humiliate yourself
on the courthouse steps like a child.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.511
That didn't humiliate me.
It humiliated you.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.846
Fine. Take your drug money and go.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.142
There's over $2 million in that bag.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.144
That's a lot of goodwill.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.647
-It's a lot of tithing.
-You are disgusting.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.525
Okay, well, we've established what
you've thought of me a long time ago.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.361
Now I want you…

11:37.363 --> 11:38.489
to consider this money.

11:39.782 --> 11:40.658
Hmm?

11:49.417 --> 11:50.543
Uh-uh!

11:56.924 --> 11:58.175
[rattles]

12:03.305 --> 12:06.142
[clicks tongue, gasps] Hello.

12:07.017 --> 12:07.893
[chuckles]

12:11.397 --> 12:13.399
[chuckles]

12:21.198 --> 12:23.576
You sure you wanna raise two teenagers?

12:24.076 --> 12:26.120
[exhales] I really do.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.748
Look, you're exhausted. You should be.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.834
You fought hard. You won.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.004
Just take the money.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.924
There's only one road out of town.

12:39.008 --> 12:43.179
All you gotta do
is get on it and drive away.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.224
Two million dollars. It's a game changer.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.226
It's a life changer.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.940
You're right.
Two million dollars is a lot of money.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.150
Mm-hmm.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.028
-[Nathan] New house.
-Mm!

12:59.737 --> 13:00.738
New car.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.241
Security, safety.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.163
But I'm gonna go ahead and keep the kids.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.959
Now, you go, or I'll call the police.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.181
You know, when Mom was really sick--

13:27.264 --> 13:29.099
-Oh, no. I'm not doing that.
-Oh, no.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.977
Well, you might not remember
because you spent the whole year

13:32.061 --> 13:33.979
at the Great Boone Saloon.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.440
But when she was dying
and I was taking care of her--

13:36.524 --> 13:38.359
[Nathan] You never took care of her.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.279
I did. And you know what she talked about?

13:42.363 --> 13:45.449
-You have told me that fiction before.
-[Wendy] She apologized for you.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.702
For beating us,
for being a liar and a drunk and a cheat.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.412
I never cheated on your mother.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.497
[Wendy] You did.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.792
And she knew you did.

13:55.793 --> 13:59.421
And she forgave you
'cause Mom was a real Christian.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.342
You go, or I call.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.886
[inhales] But I'm not nearly as devout,

14:05.970 --> 14:08.889
and I will kill you
before I let you take my kids.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.073
[exhales, sighs]

14:28.284 --> 14:31.745
[Ruth] As hard as it might be to believe,
this ain't personal.

14:31.829 --> 14:35.082
[chuckles] I mean, it ain't all personal.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.626
And it's not like you still
don't own a big chunk of the place.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.045
I mean, we're setting up
for your party as we speak.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.006
Can you just give me
a sunset period on this?

14:42.089 --> 14:44.675
Just this one last thing for Navarro.
Then that's it.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.805
This is really about you
refusing to dirty up your own shit.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.307
That's the problem here.

14:52.808 --> 14:53.767
It's not.

14:53.851 --> 14:57.146
Navarro will not let me launder
through any of his other businesses.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.647
[Ruth] Then use your own businesses.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.151
Use Lickety Splitz
and Harry's and the Blue Cat

15:02.234 --> 15:04.862
or whatever else y'all plunder
and get it done.

15:04.945 --> 15:08.115
Or-- or invent a business.
You're good at shit like that.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.828
I'm not workshopping this with you, Ruth.
There's a time concern here, okay?

15:13.454 --> 15:14.455
[scoffs]

15:15.956 --> 15:18.918
There's always gonna be
some concern, right?

15:20.669 --> 15:21.629
[inhales]

15:23.380 --> 15:25.257
I cleaned my record up.

15:26.175 --> 15:30.012
And you and Wendy
ain't gonna shit where I eat.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.821
So you gotta hand it to her.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.658
She's a fucking little animal.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.202
We'll smurf it in.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.704
I'll get a bunch of people together
in the morning.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.081
I'll send them in tomorrow night.

15:57.164 --> 16:00.334
-It's too much.
-No, we'll go peak hours, big, big teams.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.213
I can get it done in a few days.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.297
I don't think so.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.427
Well, what do you suggest?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.807
-We have this huge event.
-No.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.143
With money coming in from multiple states

16:18.227 --> 16:21.355
and sources, organizations,
in the millions.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.984
It may be our only chance
to move this kind of cash.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.277
When we are set up,

16:28.529 --> 16:32.408
we are going to be
a major employer in Chicago.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.494
We are gonna be helping people
on a large scale.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.496
Women, sick people, poor people.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.540
And if anyone even looked…

16:40.874 --> 16:47.423
If-- if the IRS or the FBI or anyone
even mention investigation, it's all over.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.634
Image is everything in that world.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.595
I can't lose it.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.852
You've gotta get them to come home.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.530
I'm not so sure I can do that.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.787
Well, if you won't do it, I'll do it.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.920
What does that mean?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.966
What the fuck do you think it means?

17:34.136 --> 17:34.970
[chuckles]

17:43.437 --> 17:46.815
Look, I--
I'm-- I'm-- I'm begging you guys to stay.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.402
-[Charlotte] Dad--
-I know it's hard to see right now.

17:50.486 --> 17:54.031
But the most important thing
is your family.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.159
Grandpa's family.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.371
But he's not somebody
that you know, Jonah.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.416
I know he's better than Mom.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.501
Jonah.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.128
-What?
-It's not--

18:08.212 --> 18:11.298
He is. And besides, this'll be
a good chance to get to know him.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.596
[Charlotte] What about you?

18:18.555 --> 18:20.724
Let's say that
we get out of this tomorrow,

18:20.808 --> 18:23.894
which of course we don't,
but let's say that we do.

18:26.230 --> 18:30.234
Are you really gonna stay with Mom
after all that she's put you through?

18:30.317 --> 18:32.778
We've put each other through a lot.
This is not all on your mom.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.322
-[Charlotte] Okay.
-[Jonah] You're not answering her.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.825
And I'm gonna make sure
that we all get through this.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.954
By doing everything she says.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.789
By staying.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.333
By staying.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.380
And then what?

18:53.507 --> 18:54.508
And then,

18:55.884 --> 18:58.762
we will all have decisions to make.

18:59.888 --> 19:00.889
Okay?

19:06.061 --> 19:08.272
[Wendy] We have a lot
of people coming into the airfield,

19:08.355 --> 19:10.232
so if you booked four cars,
I'd make it five.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.442
-I already booked five.
-Then make it six.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.194
Okay, you know what? [scoffs]

19:14.278 --> 19:17.531
If you got something to say to me,
just go ahead and say it.

19:19.950 --> 19:24.329
This place was built for one reason,
to launder money for Omar Navarro.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.251
So it which makes what you're doing
inherently dangerous.

19:29.334 --> 19:33.338
You just got your life together.
I-I don't see this going very well.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.383
Thank you for that. [inhales]

19:37.050 --> 19:40.304
But Ruth hired me
because I'm a good manager.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.472
-And I've always been a good manager.
-Oh!

19:42.556 --> 19:44.892
-Yeah.
-Your business was failing when I met you.

19:44.975 --> 19:49.271
[chuckles] The place will run perfectly
the night of your fundraiser

19:49.354 --> 19:53.859
because it is important to the casino,
and the casino is important to Ruth.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.820
[inhales] But you should know,
outside of the civility of doing business,

19:56.904 --> 19:58.864
I got no use for you.

19:58.947 --> 20:02.367
I think you are a ruthless, nasty bitch.

20:02.951 --> 20:06.747
I think you have no sense of humor
or human fucking decency.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.084
Now I'm gonna go order those town cars.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.842
I do too have a sense of humor.

20:20.844 --> 20:21.845
Asshole.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.406
[Charlotte] Think this is the last of it.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.366
[sighs]

20:43.659 --> 20:45.535
We're gonna head back to the motel.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.499
Okay. Wendy, you gonna come out?

20:50.582 --> 20:51.458
[sighs]

20:54.127 --> 20:55.128
Bye, Mom.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.824
How's Keith Deltrek got stacks that big?
He's been here 15 minutes.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.909
Bullshit's how. Get him out.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.328
Kenny, bounce the Deltrek boy from craps.

21:28.412 --> 21:32.416
I wonder why this slutty jackass here
is hitting on 18 against a six.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.220
[Marty] She's not gonna let us have this.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.474
I'm going to bed. [exhales]

21:49.558 --> 21:51.685
We'll deal with it in the morning.

launder their money.

22:50.786 --> 22:51.912
Do you understand me?

22:53.663 --> 22:55.123
-[exclaims]
-Say it.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.042
I underst-- I understand.

-What in the holy hell is wrong with you?
-What are you talking about?

23:20.774 --> 23:23.819
You sent an assassin at me
in the parking lot.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.987
What? No, I didn't send anyone after you.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.740
-Please keep your volume down, okay?
-So it was your wife then.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.742
-I don't--
-That sounds about right.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.161
I'm gonna tell you something.
You and your dick wife

23:33.245 --> 23:35.622
can launder your drug money
about a hundred other ways…

23:35.705 --> 23:36.540

23:36.623 --> 23:38.417
…and yet you insist on fucking with Ruth.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.460
-Why such a hard-on for that woman?
-Rachel.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.046
I don't have a hard-on
for her or anyone else, okay?

23:43.130 --> 23:44.548
I'm gonna give you an example.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.008
You have 30 different vendors.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.553
You are working with millionaire donors.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.762
I can't do that.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.390
Really? Why not?
Math looks pretty easy to me.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.225
Because I can't.

24:00.272 --> 24:04.484
This is Wendy. All this.
You don't give a shit about any of this.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.495
I really hope she's worth it, man.

24:18.999 --> 24:22.502
I'm very sorry that somebody
came after you. Unacceptable.

24:24.087 --> 24:27.466
But, Rachel, I-I need
your help with Ruth, please.

24:27.549 --> 24:28.800
This is about Wyatt.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.678
This is about,
you know, so many other things.

24:32.762 --> 24:36.975
And this is the last time
I will ever ask her for anything.

24:41.062 --> 24:41.938
Okay.

24:44.065 --> 24:47.903
[Townson] All righty, we're rocking it
through your drive time here at KPVK.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.697
Still keep an eye on
this weather system, folks.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.533
Maybe tomorrow
you ought to take the day off

24:53.617 --> 24:57.871
'cause the skies are gonna open up
and a hard rain's gonna fall.

24:58.455 --> 25:01.708

Townson Wells, on this Two-for-Tuesday.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.699
they'd be happy to let you run the cartel.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.495
Are you suggesting that I run the cartel?

27:43.578 --> 27:44.579
-[Wendy] No.
-Good.

27:46.039 --> 27:49.959
I'm simply saying that
the FBI's already given us the answer.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.672
We don't need Navarro.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.132
How?

27:56.216 --> 27:58.343
-[Wendy] Camila.
-Camila?

Let's give her the whole thing.
Let's tell her everything.

-The whole story, the FBI, everything.
-You wanna confirm her suspicions.

Tell her we've been working
for law enforcement. She'll kill us.

28:09.521 --> 28:13.191
[chuckles] No, we make it an offer
that's too good of a deal to turn down.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.902

the entire cartel is just gonna think

28:15.985 --> 28:18.029
Navarro's alive
and running everything through Camila.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.573
I mean, that's what everyone
will think everywhere.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.326
I mean, but in reality,
Navarro will be dead,

28:24.327 --> 28:26.079
and Camila will be head of the cartel.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.164

the FBI is gonna be willing

28:28.248 --> 28:30.792

while Camila has Navarro killed.

a-- a shadow cartel leader?

28:36.005 --> 28:38.425
All they want is the money
from the seizures.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.136
Look, I mean, these people, to the FBI,

28:41.219 --> 28:44.389
they're just, they're interchangeable.
They're disposable.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.269
If you see another way…

28:51.187 --> 28:53.398
You think she'd be willing to do it?

28:53.481 --> 28:55.108
[Wendy] I can get her to do it.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.402
Mm-hmm.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.196
I can.

29:00.905 --> 29:03.032
-[thunder rumbling]
-[bottles clattering]

29:10.874 --> 29:12.834
[Ruth] Mr. Davis, how are you tonight?

29:14.210 --> 29:15.879
[chuckles] Oh, hi.

29:15.962 --> 29:20.341
Annalise loves those Mexican Cokes.
Got a sweet tooth.

29:20.842 --> 29:21.718
[Ruth] Hmm.

29:23.011 --> 29:23.928
Well, I love beer.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.767
Well, you sure clean up nice, don't you?

29:28.850 --> 29:32.520
Yeah, I'm about to go to work now.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.230
Oh, that's right.

29:34.314 --> 29:37.025
You now own the floating city of Gomorrah.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.652
[chuckles] How proud you must be.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.199
Hey, um… [clears throat]

29:44.282 --> 29:47.702
I've been meaning to ask you.
How's the schools out by where y'all live?

29:49.537 --> 29:53.124
Why do all you women
care so much about the schools?

29:54.501 --> 29:56.085
Those two are smarter than shit.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.630
They're gonna need good fucking teachers.

29:58.713 --> 30:01.174
And you can watch your language around me.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.510
I'm sorry.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.179
I've got a sailor's mouth.

30:07.597 --> 30:10.433
How'd you and my son
spend time together, anyway?

30:12.811 --> 30:14.145
What-- what do you mean?

30:15.021 --> 30:16.564
Aside from the physical.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.109
What'd you do? What'd you talk about?

30:23.154 --> 30:24.072
Uh…

30:25.448 --> 30:28.535
I guess we talked about
what everybody talks about.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.996
You know. "How was your day?"

30:33.498 --> 30:35.917
"What do we wanna do?
What do we wanna eat?"

30:36.000 --> 30:37.710
[chuckles] Yeah.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.880
'Cause you're not his type.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.511
All right.

30:47.011 --> 30:50.056
He likes brunettes, same as me.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.517
You can't trust blondes.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.687
Hmm, no,
I figure you can't trust about anyone.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.857
And they're smart-mouthed.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.025
-[chuckles]
-Hmm. Okay.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.987
-You have a good night now.
-Have a good time on your boat.

31:04.070 --> 31:07.282
-[Ruth] Mm-hmm.
-[chuckles]

31:10.118 --> 31:13.413
[Camila] I know for a while now
that you're working with the FBI.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.956
[Marty] Hmm.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.958
These seizures are the fee.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.043
That's the price of doing business.

31:19.127 --> 31:23.089
Uh, otherwise, they--
they won't interfere with your operations.

31:23.172 --> 31:26.175
[Wendy] Both your brother and your son
knew how smart this deal is.

31:26.259 --> 31:27.385
And look at the two of them.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.430
-You're different.
-[Camila] Hmm.

31:30.513 --> 31:34.225
Your brother was taken down
by a-- a rogue FBI agent.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.351
-An outlier.
-Yeah.

31:35.435 --> 31:38.563
And the Bureau is very much on our side.

31:38.646 --> 31:42.108
And your son, may he rest in peace,
he was never given the opportunity

31:42.191 --> 31:45.320
to embrace the arrangement
because your brother had him killed.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.906
[inhales] You want me to run the cartel

31:47.989 --> 31:51.451
while the world believes
my brother's running it. Why?

31:52.785 --> 31:55.496
In maintaining the appearance
of a patriarchy…

31:56.539 --> 31:57.415
[Camila] Oh.

31:57.498 --> 32:01.252
…it avoids a lot of headaches
in your organization, don't you think?

32:01.336 --> 32:03.421
[Camila] Don't pretend
like this is for my benefit.

32:04.172 --> 32:08.968
[inhales] If I run the cartel
with the approval of the FBI,

32:09.052 --> 32:10.970
that means they'll stop investigating you,

32:11.054 --> 32:14.349
and you'll be free to run
your foundation and play kingmaker.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.061
All those things can be true at once.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.024
How are things with your kids?

32:27.612 --> 32:31.240
Not great,
but we're working through it. Thanks.

32:31.866 --> 32:33.409
[Camila] They're at a wild age.

32:33.493 --> 32:36.245
Difficult, emotional.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.497
[Wendy] Yes, they are.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.210
Your family means a lot to you.

32:43.002 --> 32:46.297
Well, my family means a lot to me too.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.342
And yet,
you'll have me kill my own brother

32:49.425 --> 32:51.010
to make all this possible.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.808
We know, Camila.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.311
We know it was you

33:01.771 --> 33:03.940
who made the attempt
on your brother's life.

33:05.024 --> 33:07.443
And we never told him, and we never will,

33:08.027 --> 33:10.029
because we wanna keep you alive.

33:12.115 --> 33:13.616
Make you king.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.702
[chuckles]

33:16.577 --> 33:18.913
[inhales] Now that I know all this,

33:20.623 --> 33:23.167
what makes you think I won't kill you?

33:25.003 --> 33:26.838
'Cause with us, you get the FBI.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.674
You get to run
the biggest cartel in the world

33:29.757 --> 33:32.051
and never be on any most wanted list.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.553
Never see a prison cell.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.973
You'll be everything and nothing at once,

33:38.349 --> 33:41.269
which if I'm not mistaken
is exactly what you want.

33:45.356 --> 33:46.274
Okay.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.280
"Okay" as in "yes"?

33:53.990 --> 33:55.241
"Okay" as in "yes."

34:00.163 --> 34:01.247
[Marty chuckles]

34:04.042 --> 34:05.918
We'll set up a meeting with the FBI.

34:06.669 --> 34:09.839
[inhales] I'll need
to visit Omar one last time.

34:11.841 --> 34:14.385
I-I don't think that that's the best idea.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.262
Yeah, well--
well, no, what he means is, it--

34:16.345 --> 34:18.347
it would be easier
on you if you didn't see him.

34:19.307 --> 34:20.558
Oh, I'll be fine.

34:21.392 --> 34:23.728
Of course, but, um… [sighs]

34:23.811 --> 34:26.064
We'll look into it,
but it may not be possible.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.358
I believe you'll make it possible.

34:36.699 --> 34:40.078
How fast can we fill a board seat
if I told Schafer to fuck off?

34:40.161 --> 34:44.874
[scoffs] I told you, at this point,
you need Schafer to get Navarro off SDN,

34:44.957 --> 34:49.504
or you need a lot more time and money
to put a new team together.

34:49.587 --> 34:50.463
[Wendy] Hmm.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.008
It might be that
we don't need him off the list, after all.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.428
Why, you, um,
planning on killing another cartel head?

34:57.512 --> 34:58.346
[chuckles] No.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.057
Right, well… [exhales]

35:01.557 --> 35:04.393
…I could fill Schafer's seat
in whiplash time.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.313
What about damage control?

35:07.396 --> 35:08.481
Not bad.

35:08.564 --> 35:09.565
Good, potentially.

35:09.649 --> 35:13.027
If you get out in front, say that
you're willing to take a financial hit

35:13.111 --> 35:17.281
if it means not getting into bed
with amoral people. Blah, blah, blah…

35:18.699 --> 35:19.617
Good.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.745
"Potentially good"
is what I wanted to hear.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.456
[chuckles]

35:31.504 --> 35:33.840
[in Spanish] What are you doing here?

35:34.966 --> 35:37.552
[Camila] I'm in town for the gala,
and I wanted to see you.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.512
-Is that okay?
-Yes, of course.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.515
[Camila] You look better.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.977
More blood in your face.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.815
They don't cut your hair, do they?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.861
Hmm. It makes you look young.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.362
[Omar chuckles]

35:59.532 --> 36:01.367
[Camila] Do you remember my wedding?

36:02.493 --> 36:04.120
That's an odd question.

36:05.037 --> 36:09.000
Barely. I was 15 and very drunk.

36:11.669 --> 36:14.172
You got in so much trouble.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.925
Dad was so mad at you.

36:19.468 --> 36:22.096
He was screaming at you
in that little vestibule.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.765
You came over and asked him to dance.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.894
You do remember.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.063
You winked at me.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.192
That's right.

36:35.776 --> 36:38.029
-I winked at you.
-[chuckles]

36:42.825 --> 36:44.202
My little buddy.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.381
I didn't kill Javi.

37:09.101 --> 37:12.521
Your son was not a traitor, Camila,
and I didn't kill him.

37:16.609 --> 37:19.612
I used his death to see who was who.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.410
But I didn't kill your son.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.162
Then who did?

37:31.958 --> 37:33.626
I don't know.

37:36.587 --> 37:37.838
Who told you?

37:41.926 --> 37:43.219
Wendy Byrde.

37:51.644 --> 37:54.814
[cell phone rings]

37:55.606 --> 37:57.233
[in English] Hi, this is Marty Byrde.

37:57.316 --> 38:00.569
Marty, it's Camila. How are you?

38:02.446 --> 38:04.782
Uh, good, Camila. How are you?

38:05.908 --> 38:08.619
I'm gonna need you to tell me
who killed my son.

38:10.413 --> 38:14.542
I-I know that your--
your brother ordered the hit,

38:14.625 --> 38:18.254
but I don't-- I don't know
who actually did it. I'm sorry.

38:19.630 --> 38:22.008
Omar just told me he didn't order it.

38:22.925 --> 38:25.553
It's important that you're honest with me.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.097
Uh… [hesitates]

38:29.598 --> 38:31.851
Listen, uh, y-you know, Camila, I'm--

38:31.934 --> 38:34.603
I'm not really
on that side of the business,

38:34.687 --> 38:37.606
so I don't have any details.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.608
Um, I apologize, you know.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.361
I'll-- I'll-- I'll look
into it for you if you'd like.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.990
But, uh, you know, I just--
I might not be the best person to ask.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.576
All right.

38:49.952 --> 38:51.329
I'll see you soon.

38:53.914 --> 38:54.957
[phone beeps]

38:56.667 --> 38:57.501
[sighs]

39:04.175 --> 39:06.177
[workers shouting]

39:19.982 --> 39:22.068
[Rachel] Thanks for letting me stay over.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.237
[Ruth] Oh, I like the company.

39:26.655 --> 39:30.326
Three's hardly ever here,
and when I get it done,

39:31.327 --> 39:33.621
you can have the guesthouse
if you want or…

39:34.413 --> 39:37.083
or, uh, live in the big house.

39:37.166 --> 39:40.336
Yeah, it'll be too much for me and Three.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.136
It's okay to move up, you know.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.223
You deserve this.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.480
[inhales] Yeah.

39:59.563 --> 40:02.566
Don't you-- don't you
fucking shrug me off, you bitch.

40:02.650 --> 40:03.609
-Don't do that.
-[laughs]

40:03.692 --> 40:07.405
You deserve the whole fucking thing.
You do. New start, new house.

40:10.699 --> 40:11.700
New life.

40:16.997 --> 40:17.998
I guess.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.835
Well, I know.

40:26.465 --> 40:29.510
[thunder rumbling, crashing]

40:36.851 --> 40:38.853
[knock on door]

40:45.609 --> 40:48.237
[knocking continues]

40:51.740 --> 40:52.950
[door opens]

41:00.875 --> 41:01.750
[door closes]

41:02.668 --> 41:04.670
[footsteps approaching]

41:14.013 --> 41:16.307
[Benitez] Hey. Hey.

41:16.390 --> 41:19.059
[inhales] Your door was a little bit open.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.060
[sighs]

41:22.438 --> 41:23.814
What can I do for you?

41:25.065 --> 41:26.609
[Benitez] He wants to see you.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.446
He had an uncomfortable visit
from his sister today,

41:30.529 --> 41:33.532
and he wants to talk to you and Marty.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.620
Okay.

41:40.372 --> 41:41.207
[Benitez] Okay.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.633
[sighs]

41:52.551 --> 41:54.303
What's going on? [exhales]

41:56.764 --> 41:57.848
[Wendy clicks tongue]

41:59.850 --> 42:03.479
-My children left me.
-[inhales] Mm-hmm.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.859
Don't you think
they'll probably come back?

42:08.943 --> 42:12.321
No, I think my father is gonna poison
them against me.

42:12.404 --> 42:13.781
[Benitez] Hmm. Mm-hmm.

42:13.864 --> 42:14.823
[clears throat]

42:15.366 --> 42:17.076
[exhales]

42:18.369 --> 42:21.747
I had a terrible relationship
with my father.

42:23.874 --> 42:26.043
He was a massive prick. [huffs]

42:29.755 --> 42:31.966
It's not bragging if it's true.

42:34.969 --> 42:35.970
He's dead now.

42:38.472 --> 42:41.684
But he hit my mother. He hit my sisters.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.813
Beat me and my brothers.

42:52.152 --> 42:56.156
[exhales] I've forgiven him, of course.

42:59.535 --> 43:00.536
Of course.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.291
But there was a time there

43:06.417 --> 43:07.751
where it was either…

43:09.878 --> 43:10.838
kill the man…

43:12.965 --> 43:14.925
or join the church.

43:23.642 --> 43:24.643
Is that right?

43:29.440 --> 43:30.441
Thanks for that.

43:38.449 --> 43:39.950
Yeah, you're welcome.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.331
Thank you.

44:16.695 --> 44:19.990
Now, you're either gonna
let me in this hospital,

44:20.074 --> 44:23.661
or I'm gonna leave this building,
and I'm gonna kill my father.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.248
So, why don't you pass me
that clipboard there?

44:28.332 --> 44:30.042
Let's get to know each other, hmm?

44:40.219 --> 44:43.722
Hey, you can stay at mine
again tonight if you want.

44:43.806 --> 44:47.309
We can watch, uh, Duck Dynasty
and feel good about ourselves.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.728
-[Rachel] That does sound fun.
-[laughs] Yeah.

44:49.812 --> 44:54.358
Uh, well, uh, I got an errand to run,
so, uh, I'll bring home dinner.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.151
[both chuckle]

44:56.235 --> 44:57.903
-[Rachel] Careful out there.
-Yep.

45:03.575 --> 45:05.452
Do you, uh, do you need anything?

45:07.996 --> 45:08.997
No.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.712
What are you doing in here exactly?

45:16.672 --> 45:18.507
[Wendy] Did you tell the kids I'm in here?

45:18.590 --> 45:20.801
No, I did not tell the kids.
I don't wanna worry them.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.262
The whole point is to worry the kids.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.890
You know,
we got that fundraiser in two days.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.893
Don't you wanna be able
to get ready for that? Be rested?

45:29.977 --> 45:31.687
[Wendy] Tell the kids I'm in here.

45:37.693 --> 45:40.654
And-- and what about Camila? You know,
we got this new deal with Camila.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.407
Are you-- you gonna make me
handle that all on my own?

45:43.490 --> 45:45.701
If I leave here, I'll kill him.

45:46.660 --> 45:47.494
Who?

45:48.162 --> 45:50.164
What do-- what do you mean "who"?

45:51.039 --> 45:52.082
My dad.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.043
Okay, that's enough.

46:00.340 --> 46:02.593
I'm not leaving here
till I get my kids back.

46:04.511 --> 46:05.596
[Marty clicks tongue]

46:06.764 --> 46:08.348
-Got it.
-Mm-hmm.

46:42.299 --> 46:43.300
Asshole.

47:19.878 --> 47:20.796
[seat belt clicks]

47:45.153 --> 47:47.155
We need some place private to talk.

47:50.742 --> 47:54.329
I'll be in my office
with Ms. Langmore if y'all need me.

47:56.206 --> 47:58.959
[Ruth] All right, then. Here's the deal.

48:00.002 --> 48:04.006
The man you got sitting
in prison over there for Wyatt's murder.

48:04.089 --> 48:05.257
He didn't do it.

48:05.340 --> 48:06.592
Hold on a minute.

48:08.010 --> 48:11.972
Maybe you should get yourself a lawyer
before you say anything else.

48:12.055 --> 48:13.140
No need.

48:15.809 --> 48:16.727
All right.

48:17.352 --> 48:18.812
Go on, then.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.523
A motherfucker named
Javi Elizondro did it.

48:21.607 --> 48:25.193
He works for the Navarro Cartel,
and he had them--

48:25.277 --> 48:26.695
[Ronnie] The Navarro cartel?

48:26.778 --> 48:29.990
Can-- can I--
can I get through this, please?

48:32.117 --> 48:33.493
Yes.

48:34.077 --> 48:36.538
He had a problem
with Darlene growing heroin,

48:37.414 --> 48:40.834
and he shot her

48:41.585 --> 48:42.669
and Wyatt,

48:43.795 --> 48:46.590
and-- and when I found that out,

48:47.257 --> 48:52.054
I hunted him down
and-- and killed him in Chicago.

48:53.472 --> 48:54.890
So-- so the man's dead.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.309
Jesus Christ, Ruth.

48:57.392 --> 48:59.853
[Ruth] And-- and--
and you ain't never gonna find him.

48:59.937 --> 49:04.274
And it might also interest you to know
that Javi Elizondro killed Sheriff Nix,

49:04.358 --> 49:07.778
so you can take those billboards down
'cause you ain't never gonna find him.

49:07.861 --> 49:11.823
And here's the thing.
If any DA or anyone ever comes at me

49:11.907 --> 49:14.701
and says that I said
any of this shit to you,

49:14.785 --> 49:16.995
I'll deny it
and tell them that you're crazy.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.873
And who'll believe you anyway?
Because it is crazy.

49:23.085 --> 49:24.920
Now, you know how bad it looks?

49:25.003 --> 49:28.382
You getting all Darlene's money
and then coming in here

49:28.465 --> 49:33.595
with a story about cartels
and Chicago and dead cops.

49:34.721 --> 49:36.848
And just what do you expect me to do here?

49:38.350 --> 49:39.351
First of all,

49:40.644 --> 49:44.648
go ahead and follow the money if you want,

49:44.731 --> 49:47.234
'cause it ain't gonna lead you to nowhere.

49:48.735 --> 49:51.154
None of it was about money to me.

49:52.239 --> 49:54.783
And you ain't never gonna find
any evidence

49:54.866 --> 49:57.494
'cause this is some high-level shit.

49:57.577 --> 50:01.164
Now, I'm sorry to lay this all on you,
but those are the facts.

50:11.633 --> 50:15.929
My point here is
the man sitting in that jail cell

50:16.013 --> 50:21.435
ain't guilty of nothing
but being poor and being an asshole.

50:22.310 --> 50:24.604
And half of that ain't even his fault.

50:26.606 --> 50:27.983
He didn't do it.

50:31.403 --> 50:34.239
There's a fuckload of politics
in your job,

50:35.407 --> 50:37.701
but right is right.

50:38.577 --> 50:39.536
[huffs]

50:45.542 --> 50:46.501
[sighs]

50:52.090 --> 50:54.593
You're gonna be a good sheriff, Ronnie.

50:56.136 --> 50:58.764
Just be careful driving home.

50:59.431 --> 51:01.099
It's slicker than spit out.

51:22.329 --> 51:24.539
Shit, shit, fuck!

51:24.623 --> 51:26.625
[panting]

51:27.501 --> 51:29.086
[gasps]

51:29.169 --> 51:31.213
[panting]

51:31.296 --> 51:33.715
-Okay.
-[dialing phone]

51:33.799 --> 51:37.844
-[man on TV] Oh!
-[Rachel chuckling]

51:37.928 --> 51:39.930
[chattering on TV]

51:49.481 --> 51:51.483
[chuckles]

51:52.692 --> 51:56.446
Come on, man. Don't do that. [chuckles]

51:56.530 --> 51:59.699
[vibrating]

51:59.783 --> 52:01.785
[tires screeching]

52:07.624 --> 52:10.085
-Come on, Rachel. Pick up.
-[line ringing]

52:10.168 --> 52:11.086
Shit.

52:12.420 --> 52:13.255
Fuck.

52:13.338 --> 52:15.549
-[chattering on TV]
-[cell phone vibrating]

52:21.138 --> 52:24.349
Hey, I got Duck Dynasty on.
It's really good.

52:24.432 --> 52:27.269
-Okay, yeah, you need to listen to me.
-What's the matter?

52:27.352 --> 52:29.980
No, no, you--
you need to get out of there.

52:30.063 --> 52:32.315
Nelson, the guy
who fucked with you the other day,

52:32.399 --> 52:34.317
he's coming after me, and he'll find you.

52:35.193 --> 52:37.737
-Wait, what?
-Just-- just please listen to me.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.948
Go to the closet, get the rifle,

52:40.031 --> 52:43.076
and then you need to fucking run
into the woods, and you just keep running.

52:44.369 --> 52:47.289
Fuck. All right, I got it.

52:47.372 --> 52:49.749
-My shoes!
-Just forget about your fucking shoes.

52:49.833 --> 52:50.834
Fuck!

52:56.840 --> 52:59.426
-Fuck! He's coming up the drive.
-Shit.

52:59.509 --> 53:00.760
Shit, shit.

53:00.844 --> 53:04.639
Get behind the trailer. Run now!

53:04.723 --> 53:05.640
Fuck.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.101
Fucking nightmare!

53:08.185 --> 53:11.688
-Just go. Just fucking move.
-[grunts]

53:11.771 --> 53:15.817
Once he gets out of his fucking car,
you need to shoot him, or he'll kill you.

53:15.901 --> 53:17.485
He'll find you, and he'll kill you.

53:17.569 --> 53:19.821
[panting]

53:21.239 --> 53:23.658
Just slow and steady.

53:25.660 --> 53:28.413
Just do it. Slow and steady.

53:30.999 --> 53:32.959
Oh, Jesus. [groans]

53:44.262 --> 53:45.722
-[Nelson grunts]
-[Rachel whimpers]

53:49.935 --> 53:51.937
[panting]

53:54.731 --> 53:55.565
[Nelson grunts]

53:58.318 --> 53:59.444
Oh, fuck me.

54:00.445 --> 54:03.448
Look, I'm-- I'm-- I'm almost there.

54:03.531 --> 54:05.533
[panting]

54:51.997 --> 54:54.666
[theme music playing]
