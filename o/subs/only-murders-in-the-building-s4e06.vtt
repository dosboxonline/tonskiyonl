<i>- Don't forget I'm hiding one here, too.</i>
- [Super 8 whirring]

09:42.165 --> 09:44.835
<i>Don't need to see my sister
whacking off after hours.</i>

09:44.835 --> 09:48.255
<i>Would give our film the NC-17
we've been waiting for.</i>

09:49.047 --> 09:50.757
- [click, camera stops]
<i>- Huh.</i>

09:50.757 --> 09:52.843
<i>Listen, also, my little squatter,</i>

09:52.843 --> 09:55.554
<i>Dudenoff? Not in Portugal.</i>

09:55.554 --> 09:58.265
<i>Nope. He's been cashing
social security checks</i>

09:58.265 --> 10:00.267
<i>at a bodega on 125th Street.</i>

10:01.351 --> 10:03.645
<i>- Dudenoff's back in New York?</i>
- [Detective Donna Williams] <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

10:03.645 --> 10:05.772
<i>And he was here around the time Sazz died.</i>

10:05.772 --> 10:07.733
<i>He has to have something to do with this.</i>

10:07.733 --> 10:09.902
<i>Well, what's Dudenoff have to do
with the Brothers Sisters?</i>

10:09.902 --> 10:11.653
<i>Come on, Brothers Sisters, Dudenoff,</i>

10:11.653 --> 10:14.364
<i>Freddy, Chucky, Jigsaw.
I don't give a fuck. The bottom line is</i>

10:14.364 --> 10:16.783
<i>there is someone
definitely after you guys,</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:19.244
<i>so you all might wanna consider moving
to fuckin' Portugal.</i>

10:19.244 --> 10:20.329
[text dings]

10:20.329 --> 10:23.123
<i>Oh. They want me to report
back to the crime scene.</i>

10:23.123 --> 10:25.459
<i>Apparently, someone else has also spotted</i>

10:25.459 --> 10:29.046
<i>your</i> [scoffs] <i>escaped ex,
Jan Bellows,</i>

10:29.046 --> 10:30.631
<i>back in the city.</i>

10:30.631 --> 10:32.591
<i>And lucky me, they want me on it.</i>

10:33.509 --> 10:36.011
<i>Oh! Uh...</i>

10:36.011 --> 10:37.638
<i>Charles, this is for you.</i>

10:40.641 --> 10:42.684
<i>This is Sazz Pataki's remains.</i>

10:43.519 --> 10:47.356
<i>I don't know. I thought it would be nice
for her to be with you as opposed to,</i>

10:47.356 --> 10:51.068
<i>you know, on some shelf
in an evidence warehouse.</i>

10:51.068 --> 10:52.986
<i>Oh. I...</i>

10:54.238 --> 10:57.658
<i>I'll add these to my mason jar.
Thank you.</i>

10:58.492 --> 11:01.411
<i>Listen, guys, don't all be heroes, okay?</i>

11:01.411 --> 11:04.498
<i>I really do not feel like
identifying your parts.</i>

11:07.292 --> 11:10.462
<i>- Do you hear me?! The fuck?!</i>
- [overlapping yeses]

11:17.427 --> 11:19.471
Howard, would you turn off
the camera, please?

11:19.471 --> 11:23.475
[Howard] Sure. I mean, you make content
out of other people's grief, but...

11:23.475 --> 11:24.601
Right. Sorry.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.020
- [phone dings]
- Oh!

11:28.105 --> 11:31.608
Bev Melon just called an emergency
production meeting upstairs.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.986
- [Oliver] Do we go up there?
- No!

11:33.986 --> 11:36.572
We stay away from the sisters
and get outta town!

11:36.572 --> 11:39.032
No, we can't run.
We need to learn

11:39.032 --> 11:42.077
why the Brothers Sisters
are wanting us dead.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.329
- [Oliver] Uh, jealous of my talent?
- [Howard] Oh yeah.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.582
[Oliver] You know,
Rob Reiner once cut my brakes,

11:46.582 --> 11:48.584
Thelma-and-Louise-ing me into the Potomac

11:48.584 --> 11:50.961
and stole <i>The Princess Bride</i> from me.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.547
Charles, what if we go upstairs,

11:53.547 --> 11:56.341
but Howard keeps filming us?
That'll keep us safe.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.136
[Howard] Good idea.
No one's ever killed on camera.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.180
Don't google "someone killed on camera."

12:01.180 --> 12:04.558
We solve the case, save our lives,
and avenge Sazz.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.312
Fine. I'll go up
and look for that rifle case,

12:08.312 --> 12:10.022
but keep the camera rolling.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.107
[Howard]
Ooh! I get to save the day.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.818
With our lives on the line,

12:14.818 --> 12:17.988
it's a race against the clock
to solve the case

12:17.988 --> 12:19.948
and get justice.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.825
[Howard] You're supposed
to ignore the camera.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.827
It loves me.
That would be wrong.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.412
- [Mabel] Putnam!
- [Howard and Oliver yelp]

12:28.457 --> 12:30.334
- [elevator dings]
- [production office chatter]

12:30.334 --> 12:31.418
[Trina]
You're here!

12:31.418 --> 12:33.086
- We have so many questions.
- [Howard] I got it.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.005
One, has the closeness of death
made you feel more alive?

12:35.005 --> 12:36.381
<i>- Absolutely.</i>
- [Charles] <i>Uh-huh.</i>

12:36.381 --> 12:38.800
<i>Uh, uh, careful. Cameras.
We have cameras.</i>

12:38.800 --> 12:41.637
[Howard] <i>Trina, Tawny, I'm back working
for them, but it is not a big deal.</i>

12:41.637 --> 12:43.305
<i>It is nothing to murder about.</i>

12:43.305 --> 12:46.934
[whistles] Okay, everyone!
Circle around!

12:46.934 --> 12:48.101
Circle around.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.312
<i>- Come on in.</i>
- [Super 8 whirring]

12:50.312 --> 12:51.438
[clapping]

12:51.438 --> 12:54.107
- [Howard] Sorry.
- Um, I'm sure all of you may have heard

12:54.107 --> 12:57.110
about our little "firearms moment"
at the photo shoot,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.363
<i>but I'm here to assure you that,
number one,</i>

12:59.363 --> 13:01.406
the police are on it, number two,

13:01.406 --> 13:03.492
it will not affect the production one--

13:03.492 --> 13:05.619
- [clattering]
- [Marshall thuds]

13:05.619 --> 13:08.372
- I'm so sorry!
- [Bev] Oh, God. So annoying.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.165
Okay, where was I? Um...

13:10.165 --> 13:12.543
Yes, I just came back from the hospital,

13:12.543 --> 13:16.505
and Zach has asked me to send all of you
a little tiny message saying,

13:16.505 --> 13:20.092
-"The show must go on!"
- Whoo!

13:20.092 --> 13:22.469
<i>I told her I wanted out of the film.</i>

13:22.469 --> 13:24.179
<i>Then, she threatened to sue me.</i>

13:24.179 --> 13:26.348
- [machines beeping]
<i>- Then, she pulled the tube</i>

13:26.348 --> 13:29.643
<i>out of my arm
and sucked the pain meds</i>

13:29.643 --> 13:33.522
<i>out of the IV bag
like a fuckin' Capri Sun!</i>

13:34.189 --> 13:36.316
Oh, yes, and now--
Heather, um, please,

13:36.316 --> 13:40.821
I need you to all sign a waiver
releasing me of all liability.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.073
She'll give you pens, if we could do that.

13:43.073 --> 13:46.577
And I'm feeling just a little bit tired,
so I'm gonna take a quick cat nap.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.328
Snappy little nap.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.914
[quietly] There's the rifle case.
Zoom, zoom!

13:50.914 --> 13:52.833
- [Howard] Okay, okay.
- [Charles] Enhance!

13:52.833 --> 13:54.084
[Howard]
Huh?

13:54.084 --> 13:56.003
- Did you get it?
- [Howard] I zoomed.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.548
I'm gonna go check on Marshall.
Get some dirt on the Brothers Sisters.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.383
Good idea.
Spill the tea on 'em.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.136
Wait, no, that's not-- It's this--
What is it? It's something like--

14:04.136 --> 14:07.222
No, but it's close.
I-It's like a-a tea and spilling.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.183
Uh, no. Uh, this is gonna drive me nuts.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.185
- Spill the tea on 'em!
- Bingo!

14:11.185 --> 14:13.061
- Yeah, yeah. Spill the tea.
- Spill tea on 'em.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.438
- Nailed it.
- Yeah.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.651
<i>- Hey. How you holding up?
- Hey.</i>

14:19.651 --> 14:21.153
<i>Um, you know, two people got shot,</i>

14:21.153 --> 14:22.863
<i>and we're supposed to act
like nothing happened.</i>

14:22.863 --> 14:24.364
<i>How's Oliver?</i>

14:24.364 --> 14:26.742
<i>You know, people think
the killer was going after him.</i>

14:26.742 --> 14:29.536
<i>- This is so crazy.
- It is.</i>

14:29.536 --> 14:33.415
<i>The only ones who don't
seem that thrown off are...</i>

14:33.415 --> 14:35.000
<i>The twins.</i>

14:35.000 --> 14:38.795
<i>I mean, above their normal
baseline level of off.</i>

14:38.795 --> 14:41.965
<i>You think they're suspects? Wow.</i>

14:41.965 --> 14:45.093
<i>I'm not surprised actually.
Have you seen their student film?</i>

14:45.093 --> 14:47.471
[Oliver humming]

14:47.471 --> 14:49.223
<i>Ah, yes. Yeah.</i>

14:49.223 --> 14:51.141
- [♪ muffled piano music playing]
- [humming continues]

14:51.141 --> 14:53.560
[Charles] <i>Oliver, hurry up!
We started the movie.</i>

14:53.560 --> 14:55.521
[♪ piano music playing on computer]

14:55.521 --> 14:57.105
<i>- What'd I miss?</i>
- [Charles] <i>So much.</i>

14:57.105 --> 14:59.149
<i>It's weird.</i>

14:59.149 --> 15:01.318
<i>It's called</i> The Desecration of Alice.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.111
It's about an elderly artist

15:03.111 --> 15:05.280
and identical twin sisters

15:05.280 --> 15:08.742
that he made out of clay,
and they came to life.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.911
- It was a whole thing in the first scene.
- [chip crunching]

15:10.911 --> 15:14.748
[dramatic] And as he is their creator,
so they do his bidding.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.583
[normal]
They make that point very clear.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.378
And there's some kind of
anti-sugar message.

15:19.378 --> 15:22.965
[♪ avant garde piano music playing]

15:24.925 --> 15:28.762
[in unison] Yes, creator.
We will do your bidding.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.557
- [sharpening knives]
<i>- Say the word, and we'll spoil our blade</i>

15:31.557 --> 15:33.642
<i>in the flesh of your enemies.</i>

15:33.642 --> 15:36.186
[♪ dramatic music playing]

15:36.186 --> 15:40.065
Go! Spill some blood in my name, girls.

15:40.065 --> 15:43.861
[♪ music swells]

15:43.861 --> 15:45.487
[wind whistling]

15:46.280 --> 15:47.739
[Charles]
Vince Fish?!

15:50.325 --> 15:53.829
- [Tawny] <i>Act two. The Rising Action.</i>
- [♪ quirky string music playing]

16:00.711 --> 16:02.713
[Oliver clears throat, sniffs]

16:03.463 --> 16:05.507
[Vince Fish] [muffled]
<i>Visitors!</i>

16:06.383 --> 16:08.177
- [Charles] Hey-- Oh.
- Hey, hey!

16:08.177 --> 16:10.929
[Charles] Wasn't your pink eye on
the other side last time we were here?

16:10.929 --> 16:12.472
It hops. Come on in.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.933
Rudy and I are just
playing with our new toy.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.018
[mouthing] Hops?

16:16.935 --> 16:20.814
We got it at this estate sale
for this old lady.

16:20.814 --> 16:24.026
She was at that stop at the transverse,
minding her own business...

16:24.026 --> 16:25.235
[Vince]
Then, bam!

16:25.235 --> 16:27.738
Decapitated by the side-view mirror
of the M86 bus.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.364
- [Vince] Bam!
- The bus didn't even stop

16:29.364 --> 16:31.742
'cause it was pretty full,
and there was another one right behind it.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.244
- [Howard] Oh, my God.
- On the bright side, we got a drone!

16:34.244 --> 16:36.038
- [drone buzzing]
- [laughs] It's working!

16:36.038 --> 16:39.291
- <i>And it's a camera drone.</i>
- [Vince] <i>So what's with the camera?</i>

16:39.291 --> 16:42.294
[Howard] <i>Oh, we're just shooting a little
behind-the-scenes footage for the movie.</i>

16:42.294 --> 16:43.754
[Vince]
<i>I love the movies!</i>

16:43.754 --> 16:47.466
I lost my hand! I lost my bride!

16:47.466 --> 16:49.635
- [Charles and Rudy] Johnny has his hand!
- Johnny has his hand!

16:49.635 --> 16:52.095
- [all three] Johnny has his bride!
- [Oliver giggles excitedly]

16:52.095 --> 16:55.474
And then Cher Bono says, "Snap out of it!"

16:55.474 --> 16:56.683
[laughing]

16:56.683 --> 16:59.186
It's from <i>Moonstruck,</i> Mabel.
You really should see it.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.063
Yeah, I think I've seen enough.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.233
- Ah.
- Um, we also saw another movie recently.

17:04.233 --> 17:05.943
<i>The Desecration of Alice.</i>

17:05.943 --> 17:08.362
- I was in that.
- [Oliver] We saw.

17:08.820 --> 17:11.114
<i>We didn't realize you were an actor.</i>

17:11.114 --> 17:13.825
<i>Or that you knew the Brothers Sisters.</i>

17:13.825 --> 17:15.661
Oh yeah, we didn't tell you?

17:15.661 --> 17:18.497
Yeah, w-we all took classes with Dudenoff.

17:18.497 --> 17:19.915
[Rudy Thurber]
At different times.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.125
[Mabel]
So, he was your...?

17:22.125 --> 17:25.003
Film professor.
I wasn't much of an actor.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.714
You know-- No, no, no,
I was just doing him a favor.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.092
He said I had "desecrator vibes,"

17:30.092 --> 17:32.177
- but this guy, this guy...
- [Rudy laughs]

17:32.177 --> 17:34.596
...Mr. Spielberg movie.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.682
[sighs] <i>Catch Me If You Can.</i>

17:36.682 --> 17:38.600
I play an agent in Tom Hanks' office.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.477
- [Oliver] Oh!
- At the 1:07 mark,

17:40.477 --> 17:43.063
you can see me in the far right cubicle
making a phone call.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.649
- [Oliver] Really?
- Yeah, and then he got up

17:45.649 --> 17:46.942
and walked to the bathroom!

17:47.693 --> 17:50.779
But Leo DiCaprio had it cut.
Too threatened.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.823
Also, I kept looking in the lens.

17:52.823 --> 17:55.033
<i>Okay, so there is a connection</i>

17:55.033 --> 17:57.703
<i>between the Brothers Sisters and Dudenoff.</i>

17:57.703 --> 18:01.206
Oh yeah, he really made them.
I mean, they were his favorites.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.959
Not ours.
He would invite them to Oh Hell nights,

18:03.959 --> 18:06.044
and they would be kissing his ass.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.089
[mocking] "We don't love our daddy.
Be our daddy, Dudy."

18:09.089 --> 18:10.799
[normal]
They would do anything for him!

18:10.799 --> 18:13.385
[Vince] <i>Alright, Rudy, alright.
Come on, stop dwelling.</i>

18:13.385 --> 18:15.387
- It's beneath you. Come on.
- Thank you.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.055
Come on, help me pry open the window,

18:17.055 --> 18:20.017
so we can take our drone
on its maiden voyage.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.061
[whispers]
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

18:23.061 --> 18:25.314
<i>Dudenoff made them.
He gave them life.</i>

18:25.314 --> 18:27.858
[whispers] <i>So they do his bidding,
just like in their movie.</i>

18:27.858 --> 18:31.069
Oh, my God.
Did they murder for him?

18:31.069 --> 18:34.489
- [Howard] Ooh, puppet master.
- Guys, guys, we should slow down.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.784
We still don't even know
why they would want us dead.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.537
I think we should finish watching
<i>The Desecration of Alice</i>

18:40.537 --> 18:42.915
<i>before we base
our entire theory around it.</i>

18:42.915 --> 18:44.833
<i>Great, you do that.
I'm phoning Loretta</i>

18:44.833 --> 18:47.336
<i>while I still feel the fleeting
nature of my existence.</i>

18:47.336 --> 18:49.046
<i>She should be wrapping the set by now.</i>

18:49.046 --> 18:52.132
<i>Also, it's after 5:00,
