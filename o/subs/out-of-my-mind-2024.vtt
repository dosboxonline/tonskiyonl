00:23.023 --> 00:25.775
[Melody] Hi, my name is Melody Brooks.

00:26.359 --> 00:31.573
And for the price of a smoothie, you can
save a child like me with cerebral palsy.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.742
No, I'm just kidding.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.203
I don't want your money,
and I don't want your pity either.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.247
Go ahead and stare.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.331
It's 2002.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.626
You've never seen a girl in a wheelchair
who doesn't talk before?

00:44.461 --> 00:46.463
It's not like I have nothing to say.

00:46.546 --> 00:50.925
Oh, believe me, I have so much to say,
but my tongue won't cooperate.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.261
[inhales sharply]
I know what you're thinking.

00:53.344 --> 00:56.097
I sound pretty grown-up
for a 12-year-old, right?

00:56.681 --> 00:58.224
I told you I can't talk.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.143
So I don't have a voice.

01:01.603 --> 01:05.356
This will all go a lot better
if you just listen.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.154
-Obviously, this isn't my voice.
-[chattering on TV]

01:11.237 --> 01:13.323
I have no idea
what my voice would sound like.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.868
So I can sound like whoever I want.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.745
[mom] Honey! Come on, please.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.207
Well, I have to say,
that earns "tutu" pieces of candy.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.876
-[mom] Great. Okay. Now brush your teeth.
-I love you.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.504
[Melody] And I love Jennifer Aniston.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.964
So, of course I picked her voice.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.382
And I'm just borrowing it.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.467
It's not like I stole it.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.636
Sharing is caring.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.179
[mom] Did they take our insurance?

01:36.262 --> 01:39.015
[dad] I was on hold for, like, two hours,
and then they hung up.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.266
[mom] That's so annoying.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.894
You know what? Mr. Grossman canceled
his hygiene appointment today,

01:42.977 --> 01:44.646
so I'll just try them then.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.106
[Melody] This is Ollie.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.234
I wanted a dog,
but my parents said it's too much work.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.945
Here, boy. Here, boy. Ollie. [kissing]

01:52.028 --> 01:53.488
Come on. Heel!

01:53.571 --> 01:55.698
-[mom] Come on. Penny, get dressed.
-[Melody] Heel!

01:55.782 --> 01:57.617
See? He's getting pretty good.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.828
-[children] Trick or treat!
-Just a minute!

02:02.122 --> 02:04.666
[mom] Penny, come here.
Come on. You gotta put this on, okay?

02:04.749 --> 02:06.126
[Penny] But I'm bored.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.211
-[mom] You can be bored as a farmer.
-[dad] School day.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.546
-[mom] Oh, yes.
-[Melody groans]

02:09.629 --> 02:11.673
Why can't he just leave the TV on?

02:11.756 --> 02:13.675
[mom] …appointment
that my daughter, Melody, has

02:13.758 --> 02:15.218
with Dr. Spencer for three o'clock.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.387
-[Penny mumbling]
-[dad] Here you go, sweet girl.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.180
[Melody] I love to make lists.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.058
Here is a list of things
I'll never get used to:

02:23.059 --> 02:25.436
butts in my face
because people don't see me,

02:26.437 --> 02:27.438
staircases…

02:27.522 --> 02:28.690
[dad] Ollie.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.484
-…people who say hi but sound so sad…
-[whispers, indistinct]

02:31.568 --> 02:33.653
[Melody] …how JLo's hair
always looks perfect…

02:33.736 --> 02:35.405
[mom] The school's getting
a new playground.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.574
-[dad] That's a good thing, right?
-[mom] I can't believe…

02:37.657 --> 02:38.783
[Melody] …early mornings,

02:39.284 --> 02:41.286
the feeling of POP ROCKS in my mouth…

02:41.369 --> 02:43.037
[mom] There's not one accessible swing.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.455
[dad] Maybe it's not the final…

02:44.539 --> 02:47.041
[Melody] …that dessert is not considered
a complete meal.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.835
[mom] Penny, we gotta go. Let's do this.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.045
[dad] Please remember
this is about Melody, okay?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.922
-[mom sighs]
-[dad] Just don't make this about you.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.258
-[mom] Penny. Penny.
-[Penny giggles]

02:55.341 --> 02:57.719
-[mom] You have to come. We're late.
-[dad] That's not you?

02:57.802 --> 02:59.679
-[mom] Come on.
-[dad] Out, out. Come on.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.014
[sighs] Penny.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.558
[mom] Penny, come on. You're gonna have to
put these on in the car. Okay.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.351
[sighs] Okay.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.271
[straining] I love--

03:08.354 --> 03:09.772
[mom] I love you too, kitten.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.691
Um, all right.
We don't-- Don't do that now.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.693
-[dad] Huh?
-Come on. Can you help me carry this out?

03:14.194 --> 03:15.278
And just put it in the car.

03:15.778 --> 03:16.821
Love you, ladybug.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.531
-[Penny] Coming back again.
-[mom sighs]

03:18.615 --> 03:20.617
[Melody groans]

03:22.577 --> 03:23.786
Five minutes. That's it.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.039
-Wow. You are a very funny clown.
-[dad] We have to go.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.457
We already missed the bus today.

03:28.458 --> 03:32.545
-Thank you.
-And you… are so in style right now.

03:34.756 --> 03:35.757
[dad] Penny!

03:37.675 --> 03:38.927
Hop in, hop in, hop in.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.221

Melody, what is it?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.554
Are you okay? Let me see.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.057
Oh, Melody, what happened?

04:26.140 --> 04:27.892
Oh, Ollie, Ollie, Ollie, Ollie.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.143
Come on. Oh.

04:30.019 --> 04:33.773
[groans] You've gotta be more careful
with your tray. You're gonna knock into--

-Look at this. There's water everywhere.
-[groaning]

04:44.575 --> 04:46.077
Stop, stop. Just stop.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.162
I don't wanna hear it.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.247
All right?

04:49.872 --> 04:52.125

05:01.175 --> 05:02.343
I'm sorry I yelled.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.595
It wasn't fair.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.891
I lost it. I'm sorry, Melody.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.102
That's not on you, okay?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.395
[Melody] Now he wants to talk?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.190
[dad] I should have put Ollie's bowl
on a higher shelf.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.442
[Melody] It's too late.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.987
Sweet girl, are you listening?
I said, "I'm sorry."

05:24.532 --> 05:25.533

[dad] We're running a little late.
We're late for school.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.717
Don't let me hold you up.
But let me tell you what I found.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.012
Boxes of old dresses, hats, feather boa.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.930
Perfect for Halloween.
When you wanna pick 'em up?

at the register, and they run away.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.787
And try down a little lower.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.956
So, A, right?

09:42.039 --> 09:44.584
-[assistant] So you've been listening?
-[Mrs. Billups] Do this.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.669
Wanna put one on?

09:46.752 --> 09:47.920
Are we being helpful?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.380
[Katherine] The party?

09:49.463 --> 09:51.090
-[chuckles]
-[Katherine laughs]

09:51.173 --> 09:52.633
Norman's birthday party.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.927
-[laughs]
-[laughing] Okay.

09:55.011 --> 09:59.307
Why do you think Margaret lies
about Philip's kiss at the party?

10:03.853 --> 10:06.188
-Because she was trying to be cool.
-[chuckles]

10:06.272 --> 10:07.732
[Katherine] Yes, she was.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.483
Yes, she was.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.444
Mm-hmm. Awesome.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.113
[Mrs. Billups] Melody is a joy
to have in class.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.865
She is a very sweet girl.

10:15.948 --> 10:21.162
My summary is on page ten, but in short,
she meets or exceeds all my expectations.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.205
Thank you.
That was wonderful, Mrs. Billups.

10:23.289 --> 10:28.210
Now, here we have the individualized
education plan goals that we devised.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.463
-If everyone takes a look at page ten.
-[Katherine] Thank you.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.131
I'm sorry, I have a question.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.591
-That's why we're here…
-[dad] Right.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.343
…uh, Mr. Brooks. [clears throat]

10:36.510 --> 10:40.348
If Melody exceeds your expectations,
why don't you raise your expectations?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.142
[Mrs. Billups] Oh, Chuck.

10:43.225 --> 10:46.145
Melody does very well for her abilities.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.313
She listens.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.190
-She has the classroom routines down pat.
-Right.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.359
-Has she complained?
-Never.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.778
She adores Mrs. Billups.

10:54.695 --> 10:58.491
It's just she-- she shows
a great capacity for curiosity.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.910
You know, at home,
she watches a lot of documentaries.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.578
She-- She loves her telescope.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.665
Uh, we go to museums.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.751
I'm sure Melody enjoys her time
together with you.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.295
But it's-- it's more than that,
Mrs. Antenucci.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.380
It's that--

11:12.463 --> 11:13.631
[sighs]

11:15.716 --> 11:17.051
She loves to learn.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.302
We see it in her eyes.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.845
So I just-- I-I'm wondering if--

11:19.929 --> 11:25.351
[teacher] Mr. Brooks, we design IEPs
based on standardized assessments,

11:25.434 --> 11:27.895
not on the looks in children's eyes.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.563
Uh, what Mrs. Gardner means--

11:29.647 --> 11:33.609
It-It-- It's hard to be objective
about your own daughter's limitations.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.069
-Yes?
-[Chuck] Yeah.

11:35.152 --> 11:40.116
Okay. Um, why don't we resume
and take a look again at the-the--

11:40.199 --> 11:41.325
Uh, of-of course…

11:43.119 --> 11:47.081
You know, the assessments only tell us
how likely she is to succeed.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.127
Not if she will or why she may not.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.547
Mr. Brooks, I am working on a program
that is a part of--

11:54.630 --> 11:55.881
This is, uh, Ms. Ray.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.883
She's a student from the university.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.427
A postdoctoral fellow.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.679
Uh, she's here today to observe.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.807
Yes, I just-- I just really think
that Melody might benefit from--

12:04.890 --> 12:06.976
I'm so sorry I'm late. Sorry. So sorry.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.520
I got caught up with my little one
in kindergarten.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.605
-Hi. I'm Diane.
-Hi. Dr. Ray.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.566
-Thank you for being on the team.
-[Katherine] Thanks.

12:13.649 --> 12:14.984
-[Mrs. Antenucci] Uh, well…
-Babe.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.570
[Mrs. Antenucci] …she's actually a student
from the university, but---

12:17.653 --> 12:22.158
Okay. I, um, think we're gonna need
to get into that. [laughs]

12:22.241 --> 12:26.203

What's the scoop, girls? How do I look?

12:43.345 --> 12:45.055
-[Melody laughs]
-Scoop rhymes with poop.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.724
I mean, yeah. She's not wrong.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.017

How you doing?

Doing good.
Uh, we never got a chance to really talk.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.576

-[Chuck] Do you know who I am?
-I do. I do.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.627
-[Chuck] You remember Katherine?
-[Diane] Of course. From the IEP meeting.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.003
-[Chuck] Diane.
-Nice to see you again.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.087
You too. What's up?

13:17.171 --> 13:19.757
-I wanted to talk to you about Melody…
-[Penny] Uh-oh.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.467
-…and the program I'm doing.
-[Melody grunts]

13:21.550 --> 13:22.551
[Diane] Okay.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.805
I would love to start taking Melody
out of her class

13:25.888 --> 13:28.349
and integrate her
into the regular classrooms.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.856
So you wanna take Melody
out of special ed?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.983
Yes. One afternoon a week.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.820
And not anything super extraordinary.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.279
It would just be for sixth grade.

13:42.363 --> 13:46.075
It took us so long t-to get Melody

13:46.158 --> 13:50.663
to a place where she's valued,
respected and safe.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.041
[Diane continues, muffled]

13:55.751 --> 13:58.462
I mean, you're young, you don't have kids.
I mean, it's just that--

13:59.338 --> 14:02.424
And I-I don't think we're about to put
that at risk for your project.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.760
This might be an opportunity
for her to prove herself, Diane.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.845
Prove herself for what?

14:05.928 --> 14:07.304
-Calm down.
-I mean, prove what? I'm not--

14:09.265 --> 14:11.600

I just don't feel good about, uh…

14:14.812 --> 14:18.357
[Katherine] If you don't mind, I'm gonna
give you a little bit of paperwork.

Just to ease your mind,
Willy's parents already signed off,

14:21.694 --> 14:23.863
and I would be in the classroom with her
at all times.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.281
[Diane] I don't know.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.283
[Katherine] I only want the best
for Melody.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.326

You've not fought these people

Next thing, they're gonna be shoving 'em
all into mainstream classrooms.

[Chuck] Well,
maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.763
[Diane] Oh, maybe they can
just do away with special ed entirely

21:04.846 --> 21:06.682
and spend the money on football jerseys.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.958
[groaning]

29:12.041 --> 29:13.042
This?

29:13.543 --> 29:14.794
[Melody] Oh, my God.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.004
[Diane] Over. What?

29:16.087 --> 29:17.255
[Chuck] Penny, come on.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.966
-Tights?
-[Melody] Yes. Finally.

29:20.049 --> 29:22.552
Yes? No, we're not wearing tights.
They're impractical.

29:22.635 --> 29:25.013
We're gonna be getting in and out of cars
and using the restrooms.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.181
-The public restrooms.
-[groans]

29:26.264 --> 29:27.766
-[Melody] Then pick something good.
-I got it.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.850
-[Melody] A skirt.
-Put it on.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.268
-We gotta get ready.
-[groans]

29:30.351 --> 29:32.395
What? It's a shirt and pants.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.397
[doorbell rings]

29:34.481 --> 29:36.900
[narrator on TV] The humpback whale
was given its name

29:36.983 --> 29:40.111
because of the shape
of the hump on its dorsal.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.822
-Hi, Mrs. Brooks. I'm Rose Spencer.
-[Diane] Hi.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.450
Um, I parked my bike
at the end of your ramp.

29:45.533 --> 29:46.576
Is that okay?

29:48.536 --> 29:50.330
Yeah. Um, welcome.

29:50.413 --> 29:51.456
Come in.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.374
Uh, Melody, your, um--

29:53.875 --> 29:55.460
Rose is here.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.213
-Hi.
-Hi.

29:58.296 --> 30:01.841
[narrator] Each whale has
its own unique pattern on the underside…

30:01.925 --> 30:03.760
Oh, why don't you turn off the TV, kitten?

30:04.969 --> 30:07.472
-Um, so you're in, um…
-[TV volume increases]

30:07.555 --> 30:10.642
[narrator]
…for identifying individual whales.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.646
-…Mr. Dimming's class?
-Yes.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.940
-How's that?
-Hi.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.900
-What toy do you wanna be?
-[Rose] Ooh, wow.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.193
[Chuck] Hey, you must be Rose.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.195
-[Rose] Yeah.
-[Chuck] Hi, nice to meet you.

30:22.278 --> 30:24.614
-Ooh, what's this?
-[Penny] Daddy, we're playing.

30:24.697 --> 30:27.158
[Rose] The red fire truck has a ladder.
That's cool.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.243
To save cats in trees?

30:28.326 --> 30:29.994
[Chuck] Penny,
that can't be what you're wearing.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.830
-No, no, no! Get back here. [grunts]
-[Penny giggles]

30:31.913 --> 30:35.583
[Chuck] All right.
We have liftoff in T-minus two minutes.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.503
-[imitating rocket]
-[vocalizes]

30:39.087 --> 30:40.088
Ah. Oh.

30:43.967 --> 30:44.968
[vocalizes]

30:46.386 --> 30:47.387
You good?

30:47.887 --> 30:49.138
Yeah.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.057
-[Chuck] Penny.
-Cool.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.616
Uh, we're gonna go soon?

31:09.617 --> 31:12.161
-Yeah.
-[Rose] I heard it's a lot of fun there.

31:12.662 --> 31:13.663
[coos]

31:14.998 --> 31:17.458
So, Rose, we're-- You know,
we're happy that you decided to join us.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.543
[Rose imitates rocket]

31:18.626 --> 31:20.003
-[Penny giggles]
-Sure.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.963
My mom says
just 'cause some kids are different,

31:22.046 --> 31:24.007
doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them
like normal people.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.592
-What-- What's normal?
-[grunting]

31:25.675 --> 31:28.052
-I mean, am I normal?
-[Rose] No, no, no, no, no.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.471
Are you normal?
I-I-I tend to think that normal is--

31:30.555 --> 31:32.056
Hey, Mom,
we're trying to make friends here.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.433
Whoa.

31:33.516 --> 31:36.519
-[Penny yips]
-So, girls, what do we think?

31:36.603 --> 31:39.272
A little spa-- space time or…

31:39.355 --> 31:40.356
[sighs]

31:41.149 --> 31:43.359
[Penny] Mommy, I wanna go over there.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.694
Okay. We're gonna go over here.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.778
Huh?

31:45.862 --> 31:47.864
-To this thing. Okay.
-[Penny] Over here.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.284
[Rose] Do you know a lot about,
like, space or whatever?

31:51.367 --> 31:53.661
-[coos]
-That's cool.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.581
I mean, you must get to watch a lot of TV.

31:56.664 --> 32:01.002
No offense or anything, but my mom won't
let me do anything that's not productive.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.921
Like, on Mondays, I have my math tutor,

32:03.004 --> 32:05.506
and then on Tuesdays, I have chess,
and then Wednesdays…

32:05.590 --> 32:08.426
[space museum narrator 1]
…nebula is a type of interstellar cloud…

32:09.427 --> 32:10.511
[Penny giggles]

32:11.554 --> 32:15.558
[narrator 1] …that is so dense that it
obscures the visible wavelength of light…

32:15.642 --> 32:17.727
[narrator 2]
The distances between planets…

32:17.810 --> 32:18.937
[Rose, Claire, Jodie laugh]

32:19.020 --> 32:21.648
[Melody] Things I can do
that you only think I can't:

32:22.398 --> 32:23.483
make people laugh,

32:24.692 --> 32:25.693
a relay race,

32:27.028 --> 32:28.404
algebra,

32:28.488 --> 32:29.989
feed myself,

32:30.740 --> 32:32.075
beat you at a staring contest.

32:32.158 --> 32:33.159
[Chuck] Hey, Rose.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.995
Can you try to remember to include Melody?

32:36.079 --> 32:37.080
Sorry, girls.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.874
I was just with her.
I saw my friends and wanted to say hi.

32:39.958 --> 32:40.959
[Chuck] I understand.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.169
I know it's easy
to get excited and run off,

32:43.252 --> 32:45.838
but just remember that Melody
can't go everywhere that you can.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.007
[Claire] Wait,
are you talking about the special ed kid?

32:48.091 --> 32:50.176
[Chuck] I know it's nice
to hang out with your friends.

32:50.259 --> 32:53.846
I'm just trying to say that maybe
you could find a way to include her.

32:53.930 --> 32:54.931
Okay?

32:56.391 --> 32:57.392
Where is she?

32:57.892 --> 33:01.646
[Stephen Hawking] Although we are
puny creatures on a cosmic scale,

33:01.729 --> 33:06.693
we have established a sort of order
in one small part of the universe.

33:07.819 --> 33:12.198
We have managed to understand
some of the workings of the universe

33:12.281 --> 33:15.827
and may even find a complete theory
before too long.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.329
If we do that…

33:18.413 --> 33:19.414
[Chuck] Melody.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.041
Hey, Mel, you can't run off like that.

33:23.626 --> 33:24.627
Do you understand?

33:26.337 --> 33:29.090
[Hawking] When we were young,
we weren't afraid to ask why…

33:29.173 --> 33:30.758
[Chuck] That's Stephen Hawking.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.011
He's kinda like you, huh?

33:33.094 --> 33:34.095
-Mmm.
-No?

33:34.178 --> 33:35.179
-[chuckles]
-Mmm.

33:38.766 --> 33:39.767
"Talk."

33:41.102 --> 33:42.520
[Hawking] But I don't agree.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.190
[Chuck sighs]

33:50.445 --> 33:52.321
[Diane] Oh, God. Penny took forever.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.367
-Is Mel asleep?
-Yeah.

33:58.578 --> 33:59.579
[Diane] What's this?

34:01.330 --> 34:06.252
"Let your fingers do the talking
with this innovative"…

34:07.420 --> 34:09.756
"Join the conversation."

34:09.839 --> 34:11.049
"Medi-Talker."

34:11.132 --> 34:12.508
Hmm. It's called AAC.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.595
A-Augmentative
and alternative communication.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.474
Sounds like it's for an illness.

34:19.557 --> 34:22.101
-She's 12 years old, Di.
-Yeah, I-I know.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.603
She doesn't need to be pushed on a swing.

34:23.686 --> 34:24.854
She needs to be hanging out.

34:24.937 --> 34:31.110
She wants to be calling her friends on
the phone and gossiping about boys and--

34:31.194 --> 34:32.195
[Diane] I know.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.990
-How much is it?
-Oh, it's easier said than done.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.910
-[Diane] How much?
-Seventeen thousand dollars.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.036
Ah.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.330
That's just the device alone,
not including add-ons.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.207
-What about insurance?
-[Chuck] No.

34:44.290 --> 34:47.251
I talked on the phone
for two hours with someone. [stammers]

34:47.877 --> 34:50.505
Did you explain? I mean,
you can't take no from these people.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.714
Oh, I explained.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.342
I begged.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.468
I yelled.

34:55.551 --> 34:56.636
I apologized for yelling.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.222
I apologized for the tone of my apology
until the lady said

34:59.305 --> 35:01.724
that her shift was over
and that I had to call back on Monday.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.392
And now I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

35:03.476 --> 35:04.644
What am I supposed to do?

35:04.727 --> 35:07.271
You're supposed to bring in the big guns.

35:10.274 --> 35:11.859
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

35:12.568 --> 35:15.655
[employee 1] Good morning,
this is Billander Insurance. Please hold.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.240
[phones ringing]

35:18.658 --> 35:20.701
[employee 1] Thank you
for calling Billander Insurance.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.411
Hi.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.455
Oh. Hi. Can I help you?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.833
[Diane] Uh, no, I don't think so.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.585
What's your, um… [smacks lips]
…your supervisor's name?

35:29.669 --> 35:31.087
-Oh, Mrs. White.
-Yeah.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.338
-Oh, I love your blouse.
-Thank you.

35:32.421 --> 35:34.549
And what's Mrs. White's boss's name?

35:34.632 --> 35:36.217
-Mrs. White's?
-Yeah.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.468
-Mr. Potts.
-Okay.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.554
But he's the vice president
of the company,

35:39.637 --> 35:40.972
so he doesn't usually do that much--

35:41.055 --> 35:43.015
Oh, "Leonard Potts." I see it.
Thank you so much.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.143
-I'm gonna sit there and wait.
-He doesn't usually help people.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.811
-That's not--
-[Diane hums]

35:50.398 --> 35:51.858
You-- You're just gonna sit there?

35:52.441 --> 35:54.402
Yeah. I'll just wait.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.363
[humming]

35:57.446 --> 36:00.074
[employee 2] There's a woman
sitting right outside your--

36:00.158 --> 36:02.493
-[Diane] Tell him I have plenty of time.
-She's got plenty of time.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.828
-No, she, um--
-[humming]

36:03.911 --> 36:05.079
[employee 2] She's-- I think--

36:05.580 --> 36:06.956
She took out knitting, sir.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.167
What do you think of these?

36:11.544 --> 36:13.838
"Not cool."

36:15.089 --> 36:16.716
Hey, do you have these in any other color?

36:17.383 --> 36:20.344
I think she was thinking of maybe,
you know, something a little cooler.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.429
[groans]

36:23.097 --> 36:25.224
These are the only kind
that fit her pronation.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.727
-Okay.
-[cell phone rings]

36:30.771 --> 36:33.774
-[Melody vocalizes]
-Hey, did you chain yourself to a desk?

36:33.858 --> 36:36.068
-[Diane] After all that, it went well.
-[whispering] It's your mom.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.112
I mean, well, they wanna get her assessed.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.405
Oh.

36:40.239 --> 36:43.826
I mean,
I guess before they pay for her to talk,

36:43.910 --> 36:45.995
they wanna make sure
she has something to say.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.249
-Are you feeling a bit nervous?
-[coos]

36:52.043 --> 36:54.587
[Melody] Okay.
I've done, like, a hundred of these.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.423
No sweat, Melody. You got this.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.551
Here's what we're going to do.

37:01.093 --> 37:04.096
We're going to take all of those nerves
and bad feelings,

37:04.180 --> 37:06.140
and we're gonna put them in a box,

37:06.224 --> 37:09.060
and we're just gonna put it away
on a high, high shelf.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.144
[gasps]

37:11.604 --> 37:13.397
-All gone.
-Hmm.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.233
-Okay.
-Mmm.

37:15.942 --> 37:16.943
Now…

37:19.028 --> 37:21.030
I'm going to ask you some questions,

37:21.530 --> 37:25.701
and I want you to give me
your best answer.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.040
[Diane] God, this is so stressful.

37:31.123 --> 37:32.708
Why do these always take so long?

37:33.751 --> 37:34.794
It's gonna be fine.

37:50.226 --> 37:54.480
[doctor] Which one of these
is not like the others?

37:59.819 --> 38:02.029
[Melody] Not like the others.
Not like the others.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.990
Okay. Well, tomatoes are gross.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.449
Balloons you can't eat.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.952
Strawberries have seeds on the outside.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.245
Cherries have a pit.

38:09.328 --> 38:10.579
And bananas are yellow.

38:10.663 --> 38:15.042
So, I guess the real question is,
which answer does she think is right?

38:15.126 --> 38:16.168
[doctor] Which one?

38:18.254 --> 38:19.380
[Melody] Maybe banana?

38:19.880 --> 38:21.465
Balloon. No, banana.

38:21.549 --> 38:24.093
Balloon. Banana, balloon, balloon, banana.

38:24.176 --> 38:25.219
[inhales deeply]

38:27.972 --> 38:28.973
[clears throat]

38:29.974 --> 38:31.600
[Melody grunts]
Why didn't I pick the banana?

38:31.684 --> 38:33.519
Why didn't I pick the banana?

38:34.854 --> 38:35.855
[taps tray]

38:36.897 --> 38:38.232
Because you can't eat a balloon.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.862
[Melody groans] Great.
Well, that went well.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.405
[doctor] Let's try another.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.615
Mr. and Mrs. Brooks.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.909
-Hi. Thank you.
-Come, please.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.870
-[doctor] If you could just grab the door.
-[Chuck] Sure.

38:50.953 --> 38:51.954
[doctor] Thank you.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.040
[phone ringing]

38:55.207 --> 38:56.792
[receptionist] Hello, Dr. Hughly's office.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.086
[Dr. Hughly] I'm sorry about the delay.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.171
[patient vocalizes]

39:00.671 --> 39:03.174
[electronic voice]
Do you want to see a movie after this?

I'm gonna go to the back and check.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.766

could just snap her fingers

and make all of our problems disappear.

40:47.528 --> 40:51.699
Uh, surprise.
We had asked a doctor to fill this out.

-Well, we agree with that.
-Yeah.

maybe you would know somebody here

"Hey, what's up?"
That's what you want to say?

-[vocalizes]
-All right.

48:57.643 --> 49:00.020
"That's the bomb."
Is that something people say now?

"Holy crap nugget."
That's not even a word.

hovering over one and not the other?

that doesn't sound like just a question.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.058

it's not a question. It's an accusation.

Mrs. Gardner, my daughter has integrity,

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.076

to see that.

then she aced it.

with her condition before.

that Melody is a kind, nice girl. I just--

you have an explanation.

This isn't a test.

I didn't think I needed to.
This doesn't happen. I--

01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:39.031
I didn't grade her answer sheet.

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.369
That's what it's called.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:46.705
-[Elena] That's the worst word.
-I didn't make the word.

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:49.917
[Rodney] I'm gonna be honest. Maybe it's
just a period on top of the line.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.962
That's literally what it is. You don't
have to be so defensive about it.

01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:55.256
All right, all right.
Whiz Kids, Whiz Kids, listen up. Please.

01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:56.340
Sit down.

01:08:56.423 --> 01:08:58.634
Jodie, Claire. Please.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.137
Rodney, pizza out. Thank you.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.638
Listen, eyes up front.

01:09:03.764 --> 01:09:06.851
There has been a change
to the Whiz Kids roster.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.938
Melody Brooks will join the team
for the competition.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:12.731
[Claire scoffs] But Mr. Dimming…

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:15.442
[Mr. Dimming] Look,
Melody earned her place on the team

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:16.610
like the rest of you.

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:20.072
And if a mistake was made, it was mine.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.157
My fault.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.326
[Rodney] Mr. D, that makes no sense.
There's already four of us on the team.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.662
You can't just remove somebody
for somebody else.

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:27.788
[Mrs. Antenucci] Rodney.

01:09:28.289 --> 01:09:30.499
Rose Spencer will become
the first alternate.

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:32.793
[Rose] Why me?
I have put in so much time for this.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:34.712
[Mr. Dimming]
You had the lowest tryout score, Rose.

01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:37.548
[Mrs. Antenucci] Elena and Jodie
will still escort them to the tournament

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.758
and to Washington if we qualify.

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:40.968
Thank you very much.

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:42.052
Go Whiz Kids.

01:09:43.137 --> 01:09:44.889
-[Rodney] Connor.
-[Connor] Geez.

01:09:44.972 --> 01:09:47.308
I'd like to speak to you outside
right now.

01:09:50.311 --> 01:09:51.312
[Mr. Dimming] Okay, everyone.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:54.273
Uh, we've got a few weeks to regionals,
and we got a lot of work to do.

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.733
Let's, uh, gather round.

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:59.695
[Mrs. Antenucci]
I've seen all types of teachers.

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:01.780
Wallace Dimming is one of the good ones.

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.491
-He cares about his kids.
-Melody is his kid too.

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:05.993
You violated his trust.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.495
You tarnished his reputation.

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:11.165
You cannot ask him
to welcome you back after this.

01:10:11.248 --> 01:10:13.334
[scoffs] Fine.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.713
But we both know
you never wanted my program to begin with.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.467
I admire your idealism, Dr. Ray.

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.718
I really do.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.680
But I have to work in the real world.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:29.099
What world do you think Melody lives in?

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:31.310
When you're done here,
what do you think was gonna happen?

01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:34.480
Those kids were always
gonna go back to special ed.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:38.108
I can't afford to hire someone
to babysit them,

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:41.737
and even if I did, and it had all the
magical benefits that you seem to imagine,

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.821
what then?

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:46.158
More disabled kids
would move into my district.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.327
-They need resources to support them too.
-[scoffs]

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:49.703
Did you ever think of that?

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:53.332
You know what?

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:56.252
Thank you.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:59.463
You just helped me figure out
my thesis for my book.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.259
Disabilities don't hold students back.

01:11:04.468 --> 01:11:05.469
Schools do.

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:08.013
["Le triangle des Bermudes" playing]

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.399
[Melody]
People I think should marry each other:

01:11:18.899 --> 01:11:20.484
Maria and Rodney,

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:22.778
Katherine and Matthew Perry,

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.697
Claire and Dr. Evil…

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.240
Stop playing with your food.

01:11:26.323 --> 01:11:28.659
[Melody] …Mr. Dimming and nobody…

01:11:28.742 --> 01:11:30.786
Whoa! So cool.

01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:32.204
[Melody] …Connor and me.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.497
[Rodney] Let me see it.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.374
-I want one.
-[Rose] Me too.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.461
[Melody] Even if Rose wasn't mad at me,
she still wouldn't sit with me.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:43.590
Being special
usually means being separated.

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:46.302
-[Claire] I'm not sad. You're sad.
-[Jodie] Oh, my God.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:47.386
You.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:50.347
[Melody] At least I still get to sit
with the cool kids.

01:11:57.938 --> 01:11:59.273
[Penny] Melly!

01:11:59.773 --> 01:12:02.901
Whiz Kids, Whiz Kids, Whiz Kids!

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:07.281
Time to get up, time to get up,
time to get up, sleepyhead.

01:12:07.364 --> 01:12:10.367
I have a surprise for you.

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:11.702
[Melody gasps]

01:12:11.785 --> 01:12:12.786
Do you like it?

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.913
-[Melody exclaims]
-Aw.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.999
God, it's gonna be a good day.

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:19.418
I think this-- Yeah, this is it.

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:24.381
Oh, man. Look how cool this is.

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:26.759
This is so cool.

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:27.843
Oh, yeah!

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:31.055
[Mr. Dimming] All of our hard work
is leading up to this-this match.

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:33.557
-This event. Stay present. Stay focused.
-[Chuck] You okay?

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.310
Hey, remember
this is what you worked for, okay.

01:12:36.393 --> 01:12:38.854
You got this. All right? Yeah.

01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:40.564
-[Paul] Melody Brooks?
-[Diane] Yeah, hi.

01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:42.941
How's it going? My name is Paul.
I'm the stage manager here.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.027
-[Diane] Hi, Paul.
-[Paul] Can I steal you just for a second

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:46.987
so I can show you the set
and the stage and everything?

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:50.157
-[Diane] Okay, she's got this.
-[Paul] All right, you ready? Let's roll.

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:51.742
This is the set.

01:12:51.825 --> 01:12:54.870
This is--
This is where your team will be standing.

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:57.706
And, uh, that's your podium
at the very end there,

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.375
if you want to go check her out.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:00.876
We adjusted the height.

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:03.045
It's gonna line up with your chair
a little bit easier.

01:13:03.128 --> 01:13:06.548
And it's pretty simple, I mean,
there's the, you know, buttons.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:11.512
And ask you a question, you hit whatever
button is lined up with the answer.

01:13:11.595 --> 01:13:12.930
A, B, C or D.

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:16.433
Um, but also
I-I think you're gonna do great.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.811
Um, and between you and me,

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:21.939
even though I'm supposed to be neutral
and best team wins,

01:13:22.022 --> 01:13:23.107
knock their socks off.

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:24.608
Okay, mop the floor with them.

01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:26.610
I know you got it in you, okay?

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.862
[Medi-Talker] Thank you.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.699
[announcer] Will all contestants
please stay in the backstage area?

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:34.493
What do you think? Glasses on or off?

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.496
I mean,
I can barely read the questions, Paul.

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.832
-Claire, let me have it, please.
-[Claire] No, it's mine.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.083
[Mr. Dimming] One sec, Rodney.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:42.835
-[Claire] Looks like my grandma.
-[Rose] Doesn't matter.

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.837
[Claire] I'm gonna tell my grandma
you said that.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.004
[Rose] No. [chuckling] No.

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.089
[vocalizes]

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:50.300
[Rose sighs]

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:51.427
[Claire scoffs]

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.928
[Medi-Talker] I'm sorry.

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.305
[Rose] It's fine. Don't worry about it.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:58.600
I only ever hung out with you
because my parents promised me an iPod.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:06.108
[announcer] Will all contestants
please stay in the backstage area?

01:14:06.191 --> 01:14:08.444
-[Chuck] Hey, there she is.
-[Penny] Rosie.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:10.529
-[Chuck] Hey, hey.
-Hi, Penny. [chuckles]

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:13.365
-There she is. Hi!
-[Chuck] Penny. Come here.

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:15.868
[Chuck] Come on, bud.

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.494
Yeah, sure. Go to the bathroom.

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:19.705
-Uh, we're gonna, uh, go to the bathroom.
-[Chuck] Sure.

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:22.624
-Can you keep an eye on her? Okay.
-Yeah, I got it. Come on. Oh, boy.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.334
[Claire] 'Cause I like it.

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:27.421
I just want to know if I can, like,
keep it on one side or the other one.

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:32.050
[announcer] Whiz Kids family and friends,
please begin finding your seats.

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.635
The show will commence in 20 minutes.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:35.804
-[Claire] Do you have any gum?
-[Elena] Mm-mmm.

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:38.265
[door closes, locks]

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:44.938
[Diane] Do you wanna tell me
what happened?

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:47.774
-[Melody whimpers]
-[Diane] No?

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:53.071
[Diane sighs]

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:56.492
It's hard sometimes, huh?

01:14:57.534 --> 01:14:58.619
Having CP.

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:01.038
Hmm.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:04.458
Yeah. Mad.

01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:07.252
Yeah, it makes you mad.

01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:11.673
"Feel. Problem."

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:14.426
Like a problem?

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.012
-Mmm. [chuckles]
-[Diane] For who?

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.056
[sniffles]

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:22.059
[Diane] No.

01:15:22.559 --> 01:15:23.560
[Melody] Mmm.

01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:25.604
[sighs]

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.824
[Medi-Talker] I love you too.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:43.121
[Diane] Say it again.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.206
Come on.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.377
[Medi-Talker] I love you too.

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:53.006
[Melody sighs]

01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:58.762
[Diane kisses] I love you so much.

01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:05.727
Say it again.

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.896
Go on. Say it one more time.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.815
[Medi-Talker] I love you too.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:12.109
[both laughing]

01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:17.489
[presenter] Live from the JCMB studios
in sunny Sacramento.

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:20.701
It's the tri-city
Whiz Kids regional finals.

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:25.831
Hosted as always by the anchor
who puts the action in Action Eight News.

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.541
Len Kingsley.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:31.211
After the preliminary rounds,
only two teams remain.

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:33.297
And it all comes down to this.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:36.008
Twenty-five questions. Four points apiece.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.634
Destiny, a button press away.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.052
[audience cheering]

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:41.763
[presenter] Len,
tell these Whiz Kids what they can win.

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.182
Right now, one of these two teams
will win the chance

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:49.855
to compete in Washington, DC
at the National Championships for…

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.899
ten thousand dollars!

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:54.568
[audience cheering]

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.282
Without further ado,
let's welcome the Whiz Kids.

01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:04.411
From Perry Valley Elementary
in Perry Valley.

01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:05.495
Come on out.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:06.580
[audience cheering]

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:09.082
[spectator] Let's go, Perry Valley!

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.793
And from Spaulding Elementary
in Aster Grove.

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:12.961
-Let's bring it.
-Walk, walk.

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:14.671
-Let's go. Go. Go.
-[Len] Here they come.

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:16.173
Come on. Come on. Go. Smile. Smile.

01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:17.424
[audience applauding]

01:17:17.507 --> 01:17:18.592
[Len] Here they come.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:28.268
[Len] Well…

01:17:29.227 --> 01:17:31.146
-All right. All right.
-Okay, shh. You guys.

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:34.441
Everybody settle in 'cause
this is gonna be a fun one.

01:17:34.524 --> 01:17:35.692

I don't know that one.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:18.860
[Len] A, a combination
of contradictory words?

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.404
B, a sequence of rhyming words?

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:23.198
C, a word that phonetically
imitates sound?

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:25.951

01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:29.079

01:18:39.923 --> 01:18:40.799
You know the guy.

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:43.009

The answer, of course, is B, Pablo Neruda.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:56.523

What was that, dear?

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:13.540
Answer's D, megalodon.

01:19:13.623 --> 01:19:16.126

[bell dings]

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:34.269

Yes!

01:19:40.233 --> 01:19:42.611
[Len chuckles] Wow. Wow.

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:46.490
Two-point difference,
and one question to go.

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:50.035
-Here it is. Final question.
-[laser sound effect plays]

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.873
What Latin term or phrase
means "at first sight"?

[bells chiming]

01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:14.851
[chiming continues]

01:20:15.769 --> 01:20:17.521
-We in? We in?
-[bell dings]

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:21.942
And the answer is…

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.696
-A, prima facie.
-[audience applauding, cheering]

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:28.532
[Len] Oh, wow.

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:31.535
With an un-- unusual turn of events,

01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:36.289
the score between our two finalists
is tied at 83,

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:39.209
but there can only be one winner
which means…

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.503
-One moment, one mo--
-[audience laughs]

01:20:41.586 --> 01:20:43.213
[chuckles] Just one moment. Yes?

01:20:43.296 --> 01:20:45.048
[audience murmuring]

01:20:46.716 --> 01:20:47.801
[Len] All righty.

01:20:47.884 --> 01:20:53.056
Which means we will have
what the Whiz Kids call

01:20:53.139 --> 01:20:54.975
a lightning round.

01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:56.434
[thunderclap sound effect plays]

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:59.020
[Len] Players, you have 30 seconds
to choose a member

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:02.274
to represent your team
in a head-to-head matchup.

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:06.111
The first one to get the question wrong,
their team loses.

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:10.156
The other team,
well, they're off to the nationals. Go.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.826
[contestants chattering]

01:21:12.909 --> 01:21:13.910
No, I'll do it.

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.537
[chattering continues]

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.497
-[crew member mutters] Yes.
-Yeah, shh. Quiet.

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:19.833
Ten thousand dollars on the line,
and you're so sure of yourself.

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:22.168
[contestants clamoring]

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:23.962
Connor had the highest score.
Mr. Dimming said--

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:25.380
No, I didn't. [clears throat]

01:21:25.463 --> 01:21:26.965
[Claire] Why are you coughing like that?

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.550
Melody had the highest score.

01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:31.511
[Rodney] I think he's got a point.
She's barely even gotten a question wrong.

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:32.596
[Len] Ten seconds.

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:35.932
If she goes, we're gonna look like--
We're gonna look funny, okay?

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:37.559
[Connor] Holy crap, Claire.

01:21:37.642 --> 01:21:39.519
How funny are we gonna look
if we're the losers?

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:42.063
-Ten seconds and we're arguing. Just vote.
-[Rodney] Then it's Melody.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.566
Time's up! Teams, send up your contenders.

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:45.650
[audience cheering]

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:49.905
[Paul]
We're live in five, four, three, two…

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:50.989
[Len] Yeah!

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.450
And we're back with the lightning round.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:57.037
We have Trevor
from Perry Valley Elementary

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.914
and Melody from Spaulding Elementary.

01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:00.040
Yeah!

01:22:00.123 --> 01:22:01.541
[Chuck] Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.376
-Oh! [laughs]
-[screams]

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.295
Melody, Trevor, are you ready?

01:22:05.378 --> 01:22:06.713
Ready, Mr. Kingsley.

01:22:07.213 --> 01:22:08.506
Quiet, please.

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:14.012
Remember, kids, the first team that gets
a question wrong, they lose.

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:16.222
[inhales sharply] First question.

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:19.935
What is hexadactylism?

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:21.394
A, double vision?

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:22.771
[Len] B, left-handedness?

01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:24.981
C, having six appendages
on a hand or foot?

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:27.817
Or D, a form of cancer?

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:32.030
[bell chimes]

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:33.782
[bell chimes]

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.785
Having six appendages is correct.

01:22:36.868 --> 01:22:38.620
[indistinct]

01:22:38.703 --> 01:22:40.163

01:22:40.246 --> 01:22:42.624
[students cheering]

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:45.877
[Len] Next question.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.421
Who is the composer of "Rhapsody in Blue"?

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:49.881

[bell chimes]

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.472

01:22:58.723 --> 01:22:59.766
[bell chimes]

01:22:59.849 --> 01:23:00.809
B is correct.

01:23:00.892 --> 01:23:03.311
Are these kids good or what, huh?

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:04.729
Wow.

01:23:05.438 --> 01:23:06.606
Question three.

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:15.031
In outer space, a cloud of dust and gas
that blocks light from other objects is:

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:17.617
A, a black hole?

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:19.703
B, a rogue planet?

Or D, a dark nebula?

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:28.503
[bell chimes]

01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:40.890

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:42.100
[bell dings]

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:44.728
And the answer is…

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.108
Lord, give me strength.

01:23:51.776 --> 01:23:53.486
[Len] …D, dark nebula!

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:55.655
Spaulding wins it all!

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.198

01:24:01.244 --> 01:24:02.829
[Len] Congratulations, Spaulding.

01:24:02.912 --> 01:24:05.248
Spaulding will now
travel to Washington, DC

01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:06.833
to compete in the nationals.

01:24:06.916 --> 01:24:08.334
[Rodney] Hey, dude. We won.

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:10.712
[Len] I just want to thank
all the competitors today.

01:24:10.795 --> 01:24:12.047
It was a tough one.

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.257
I'll see you all at next year's Whiz Kids.

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:17.052
Until then, I'm Len Kingsley.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:18.386
Take good care.

01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:20.555
[Paul] And we're out.

01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:24.392
-Congratulations. Congratulations.
-Oh, thank you kindly.

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:27.187
Congratulations all around. Way to go.

01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:29.064
[students chattering]

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:32.108
-[Jodie retches] It's stressful.
-[glass tinkling]

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:34.903
Hey, everybody. If I could
have your attention for a second.

01:24:34.986 --> 01:24:39.074
Um, I just want to say
you were all great today.

01:24:39.157 --> 01:24:40.200
Yo. Look over at her.

01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:43.161
[Mr. Dinning] It was a real team effort.
I'm proud of you. You should be proud too.

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.245
[teacher] Hear! Hear!

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:46.498
-[Mr. Dinning] Now we're moving on to DC.
-[Claire] Oh, my God.

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.124
[Mr. Dimming] The nation's capital.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.585
You know,
face the best of the best of the best.

01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:51.711
-Embarrassing.
-[chuckles]

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.713
[Mr. Dimming] You know,
we gotta keep practicing,

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:56.633
keep preparing for the future, right?

01:24:56.716 --> 01:24:57.759
[students cheer]

01:24:57.842 --> 01:25:00.011
-[Mr. Dimming] Now you get--
-[students cheering] Yeah!

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.430
[Mr. Dimming] Now you get
what I've been talking about, right?

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:03.848
[students applauding]

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.267
[Mr. Dimming] Here's to you. Go Spaulding.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:07.519
To you.

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:16.736
[Medi-Talker]
They don't want us in class anymore.

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:19.697
Why aren't you angry?

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:25.495
If I was stuck making
anthropomorphic trees

01:25:25.578 --> 01:25:28.706
and playing hygiene bingo for years,

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.168
I would punch a hole in the wall.

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:40.051
[Medi-Talker] I would probably miss.

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:49.602
[Katherine] Melody, they are gonna say
that the kids don't feel safe.

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:52.105
That you take time away from instruction.

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:57.110
That you just can't learn.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.613
But even if that were true,

01:26:01.114 --> 01:26:04.617
you deserve to be in those classrooms,
just like everybody else.

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:16.379
[Medi-Talker]
I'm excited about Washington.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:24.554
Even if they don't want me, they need me.

01:26:25.054 --> 01:26:26.222
[Katherine chuckles]

01:26:28.057 --> 01:26:29.767
[Melody] Things I'm excited about:

01:26:30.643 --> 01:26:32.687
The first one is flying on an airplane.

01:26:32.770 --> 01:26:36.316
I love flying on airplanes,
which I hardly ever get to do.

01:26:36.399 --> 01:26:37.984
Oh. Hello.

01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:47.783
You have a voice.

01:35:49.869 --> 01:35:54.123
-And it is beautiful.
-[chuckling, sniffling]

01:35:55.624 --> 01:36:00.004
-[chuckling]
-And you have so much to say.

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:06.510
Yeah, that's what makes
your voice your own.

01:36:07.219 --> 01:36:08.596
And I want you to use it.

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:10.306
Okay?

01:36:10.389 --> 01:36:14.143
I want you to-- to sing, to scream, to…

01:36:15.978 --> 01:36:18.230
[laughs] …I don't know, tell jokes.

01:36:18.314 --> 01:36:19.315
[chuckles]

01:36:19.398 --> 01:36:20.691
[Diane laughs]

01:36:21.192 --> 01:36:24.653
[sniffling, sobs]

01:36:26.405 --> 01:36:29.158
I'm done fighting your battles. [sniffles]

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:34.789
Let them hear you.

01:36:35.498 --> 01:36:37.082
-Okay?
-[whimpers]

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:40.211
Please, please.

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:41.295
Get up here.

01:36:41.378 --> 01:36:44.048
-[breathing heavily]
-[Melody sobbing]

01:36:46.008 --> 01:36:48.886
-What are you gonna say? Huh?
-[chuckles]

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:51.222
[breathing heavily]

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:52.306
[Melody chuckles]

01:36:52.389 --> 01:36:54.350
[chuckling, sniffling]

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:08.489
It's good to be home.

01:37:09.031 --> 01:37:11.367
Back from DC with you guys.

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:13.828
So, uh, let's get started.

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:16.372
Why do we study the past?

01:37:16.872 --> 01:37:18.165
[knock on door]

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:25.631
Oh, uh-- Melody.

01:37:25.714 --> 01:37:27.341
Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, um--

01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:29.510
What are you doing here?

01:37:30.219 --> 01:37:32.763
She knows that the mainstreaming program
has ended, right?

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:34.098
She wants to talk to you.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.226
Oh, I'm so sorry about
what happened with DC.

01:37:37.309 --> 01:37:38.936
I tried to get them to hold the flight.

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:41.105
-We didn't want anyone to--
-Excuse me.

01:37:42.147 --> 01:37:43.315
[Mr. Dimming] What? I--

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.821
[Medi-Talker]
Was everyone invited to breakfast?

01:37:51.782 --> 01:37:53.492
[Medi-Talker] Except me?

01:37:53.993 --> 01:37:56.620
[Claire] Well, it's-it's kinda gross
watching you eat.

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:57.997
-Shut up, Claire.
-[student] Dude.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.415
-You all said it.
-Shut up.

01:37:59.498 --> 01:38:01.083
She would have made the plane
if she was there.

01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:02.793
-Yeah.
-[Connor] Then maybe we would've won.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:08.132
[Medi-Talker]
No matter what I did or how good I was,

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:12.303
you never treated me
like a part of the team.

01:38:12.386 --> 01:38:14.430
That's not true.
You were a huge part of the team.

01:38:14.513 --> 01:38:15.598
You did so well--

01:38:15.681 --> 01:38:19.894
[Medi-Talker]
Mr. Dimming, I have something to say.

01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:22.396
You have to wait.

01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:26.191
Okay.

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:08.734
[Medi-Talker] There's always weather
or a broken elevator.

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:16.116
Or someone in an accessible stall.

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:22.206
It stinks, but that's just how it is.

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:26.168
It goes with the chair,

01:39:27.878 --> 01:39:31.006
but you shut me out.

01:39:32.007 --> 01:39:34.218
You excluded me.

01:39:35.552 --> 01:39:39.348
That was a choice you made.

01:39:40.265 --> 01:39:42.476
And you know what?

01:39:44.687 --> 01:39:47.064
-I don't care.
-[sighs]

01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:50.109
[Medi-Talker] Not anymore.

01:39:51.193 --> 01:39:57.157
If I make you uncomfortable, deal with it.

01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:01.537
If I disgust you,

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.874
if you pity me,

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:08.711
it's your problem.

01:40:09.712 --> 01:40:11.505
Not mine.

01:40:17.344 --> 01:40:21.765
Yeah, I need a push sometimes,

01:40:22.933 --> 01:40:26.562
but I won't be pushed around.

01:40:27.062 --> 01:40:28.313
[students chuckle]

01:40:32.651 --> 01:40:33.652
[sniffles]

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:40.367
[Medi-Talker] We study the past
to prepare for the future.

01:40:42.745 --> 01:40:49.168
And this classroom
is the only place in school

01:40:49.251 --> 01:40:51.920
where I can do that.

01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:58.886
I just want to be in sixth grade.

01:40:59.845 --> 01:41:00.846
[sniffles]

01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:27.414
[Medi-Talker] So I am staying.

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.177
[both chuckle]

01:41:40.844 --> 01:41:43.680
-I mean, where does she come from?
-I don't know.

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:47.810
Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:41:48.685 --> 01:41:50.896
[Mr. Dimming, indistinct]

01:41:50.979 --> 01:41:52.106
[sighs]

01:41:53.315 --> 01:41:54.733
She's her mother's daughter.

01:41:54.817 --> 01:41:56.193
No, she's not.

01:41:57.027 --> 01:41:58.320
So much cooler.

01:41:58.403 --> 01:41:59.947
[sighs]

01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:01.532
This is true.

01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:05.869
[Mr. Dimming]
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:08.455
that all men are created equal."

01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:10.332
Who said that?

01:42:10.415 --> 01:42:11.792
Thomas Jefferson.

01:42:11.875 --> 01:42:14.837
Wrote that in the
Declaration of Independence, of course.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.296
Next question.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.714
Who said the famous line--

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:19.925
[Melody] Doesn't matter what I sound like.

01:42:20.008 --> 01:42:22.136
All that matters is what I have to say.

01:42:22.719 --> 01:42:26.056
[Medi-Talker]
Because I'm not going anywhere.

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:27.307
