00:13.000 --> 00:14.625
 It's so incredible to think

00:14.625 --> 00:18.875
that Walt started Disney Animation
100 years ago today.

00:19.541 --> 00:24.041
To think of all those talented artists
and wonderful characters

00:24.041 --> 00:27.166
who have been a part of the studio
over the years.

00:27.166 --> 00:28.250
Yep.

00:31.416 --> 00:33.416
If these walls could talk.

00:53.916 --> 00:56.708
Psst! Tink. Tinker Bell. You there?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.416
Is that it? They all gone?

01:02.541 --> 01:03.750
Oh, boy!

01:03.750 --> 01:05.750
Come on, Minnie! This is it!

01:05.750 --> 01:07.416
Let's get the gang!

01:07.416 --> 01:10.583
- Yoo-hoo!
-  There's the signal.

01:10.583 --> 01:11.875
All right, y'all!

01:11.875 --> 01:13.250
It's picture time.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.333
- That's tonight?
- That's now.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.958
100-year group photo.

01:16.958 --> 01:18.333
And the sun's going down.

01:18.333 --> 01:19.708
Come on. Let's hop to it!

01:19.708 --> 01:21.166
Ooh, a bunny pun.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.958
Got to like that.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.791
Picture time, guys!

01:26.791 --> 01:29.208
Okay! Here we come!

01:31.958 --> 01:33.416
Wake up! Wake up!

01:34.791 --> 01:36.708
- Awesome!

01:38.125 --> 01:40.875
Oh, Peter! Get the folks upstairs!

01:40.875 --> 01:42.250
- Aye, aye, Captain.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.375
Come on, everybody.

01:43.375 --> 01:46.083
Here we go!

01:57.458 --> 01:59.166
Whoo-hoo!

01:59.875 --> 02:01.958
It's Maui time!

02:03.166 --> 02:04.958
We're meeting in the lobby!

02:04.958 --> 02:06.041
Okay!

02:06.041 --> 02:07.875
-  See you there!

02:07.875 --> 02:10.958
-  Whoa!

02:14.291 --> 02:16.083

02:22.166 --> 02:24.083
- No! There's no time for tea.
-  Mmm.

02:24.083 --> 02:25.541
- Merlin! A little help?

02:25.541 --> 02:27.125
Oh! Uh, oh, ah.

02:27.125 --> 02:29.500
- Chapeauious Bowlious!
-  Oh!

02:31.125 --> 02:34.416
Oh, waiter,
there's a carp in my cap.

02:38.791 --> 02:40.291
Yikes!

02:40.291 --> 02:43.291
Do you think all the villains
will show up?

02:43.291 --> 02:44.958
Hmm. Not all.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.083
Going down?

02:49.875 --> 02:50.875

02:52.666 --> 02:54.000

It's all in the wrist.

03:03.208 --> 03:04.875

03:04.875 --> 03:06.833
