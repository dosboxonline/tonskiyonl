00:02.085 --> 00:04.838
<i>"This dusty old chestnut
has been Botoxed,</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:07.215
bedazzled, and brought back to life!"

00:08.800 --> 00:10.927
<i>Holy shit! Your mom poisoned me.</i>

00:11.344 --> 00:13.346
I'm telling the cops.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.017
Your mom confessed to killing Ben.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.060
I know.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.645
But it wasn't her.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.355
It was you at the elevator with Ben.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.901
What'd you wish for?

00:31.573 --> 00:34.200
Uh, that was <i>Grey's New Orleans
Family Burn Unit.</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:35.827
They say they're willing to wait for you.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.120
Sazz!

00:37.120 --> 00:39.247
Something I need to talk to you about
when you get a sec, huh?

00:39.247 --> 00:40.582
- It's a little sensitive?
- Yeah, sure.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.752
Since we're celebrating, I'm gonna
go upstairs, and I'm gonna get a bottle

00:43.752 --> 00:47.422
of 1966 Argentinian Malbec
I've been saving.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.972
<i>Hey, what's taking her so long?</i>

00:55.972 --> 00:59.017
Sazz better not be drinking
our Malbecita del Cielo without us.

01:16.367 --> 01:20.163
<i>Motion pictures
were created over 100 years ago</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:23.875
<i>and ever since then,
we've had countless moving images</i>

01:23.875 --> 01:25.877
<i>emblazoned in our memories.</i>

01:25.877 --> 01:28.671
<i>And ever since then,
we've had a chance to ask,</i>

01:28.671 --> 01:30.590
<i>"Is that how I look when I run?"</i>

01:31.466 --> 01:33.301
Teacher said I gotta do it!

01:33.301 --> 01:36.930
I'm gonna be crazy.
You gotta help me over here.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.264
You better, girl!

01:38.264 --> 01:40.183
<i>If you have old home movies of yourself,</i>

01:40.183 --> 01:43.436
<i>it can be hard to relate to
the person you're watching.</i>

01:43.436 --> 01:45.605
<i>"Is that really me</i>

01:45.605 --> 01:48.024
<i>"or just who I used to be?</i>

01:48.024 --> 01:51.694
<i>And is that how I want to be remembered?"</i>

01:51.694 --> 01:54.906
But at least we have
those images on screen.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.909
In that way, Ben Glenroy lives on,

01:57.909 --> 02:00.620
in his films, his TV shows,

02:00.620 --> 02:02.205
and a Super Bowl commercial

02:02.205 --> 02:05.291
where a baby stole his chili bowl.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.836
Only hours ago, we solved his murder

02:07.836 --> 02:09.963
and closed the curtain on not one,

02:09.963 --> 02:13.174
but two criminal Broadway producers.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.052
So, with that, friends in podcast land,

02:16.052 --> 02:19.013
we conclude yet another season of

02:19.013 --> 02:21.349
<i>Only Murders in the Building.</i>

02:21.349 --> 02:23.017
Until next time,

02:23.017 --> 02:25.895
I'm Charles-Ha-- Hm?

02:25.895 --> 02:28.106
What the hell?!
Jesus.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.860
Power surge.
That hasn't happened in a while.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.862
Not since they banned the old incinerator.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.197
Should I redo that last speech?
Maybe just the end?

02:36.197 --> 02:37.907
And we're back up.

02:37.907 --> 02:38.992
I need a... you know.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.618
And... action!

02:40.618 --> 02:42.954
...den Savage!

02:44.455 --> 02:47.000
You can just splice that
onto the "Charles-Ha--"

02:47.000 --> 02:48.418
Yeah, I'll get out the splicer.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.170
What a night, huh?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.505
Hey, why don't we head up to my place
for a-a proper nightcap?

02:52.505 --> 02:55.717
Maybe a, a little quick toast
to the miracles we pulled off together.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.720
I do like a sentimental moment,
especially if the liquor is good.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.431
- Ha!
- I don't, but I like liquor.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.474
And away we go.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.524
Good.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.402
I've been saving that Malbec.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.404
Weird Sazz never came back with it.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.531
Oh yeah, whatever happened to her?

03:18.531 --> 03:21.117
Who knows? Typical Sazz.
Here one minute, gone the next.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.369
Hm.

03:23.369 --> 03:27.415
Hey, did you guys see this email
from a "Bev Melon" about our podcast?

03:28.291 --> 03:31.377
Bev Melon? Must be tough to have
a last name that's a fruit.

03:31.377 --> 03:35.173
Hm.
- Fiona Apple. Darryl Strawberry.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.758
Gilbert Grape.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.678
Something was always eating him.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.266
So, what's next, podcast-wise?

03:45.266 --> 03:46.935
Charles, you mentioned a cold case?

03:46.935 --> 03:49.187
Oh, please. If it was interesting,
it wouldn't be cold.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.357
No, what we need is
a hot, fresh dead body,

03:52.357 --> 03:55.568
preferably right here
or very near to here.

03:56.194 --> 03:59.405
It's true. We've been very lucky
with people dying in our building.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.283
Yeah, but it is kind of
a flaw in our business model.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.077
Mm-hmm.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.828
Oh, my God! There she is!

04:05.828 --> 04:07.330
What?
Who?

04:07.330 --> 04:08.915
Heh.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.751
My Malbecita.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.837
So, Sazz never even made it up here?
That's odd.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.216
Okay, watch this.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.388
Mm.
- Wow, so cool.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.682
Like stepping into
a Sharper Image catalog.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.643
See? And what's cool, the cork...

04:30.395 --> 04:32.689
I've got it.
[chuckles] Oh, my God.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.024
- What a stupid--
- Oh shit!

04:35.024 --> 04:38.611
I hope these spots don't stain.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.830
Mabel, it's fine.
Maybe a little time off is a good thing.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.958
I mean, it's always a good thing
when someone doesn't get murdered, right?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.918
Yeah, always.
Oh, absolutely.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.628
But if someone had to get murdered,

04:55.628 --> 04:57.839
let's all say who we hope it would be.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.091
That's in poor taste.
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.343
Count of three. One, two...

05:02.343 --> 05:04.929
Oliver.
Me?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.752
Charles! Open up!

06:59.752 --> 07:00.920
Charles!

07:01.963 --> 07:03.756
Dead! They've closed us!

07:03.756 --> 07:05.466
<i>Death Rattle Dazzle,</i> it's over!

07:05.466 --> 07:07.552
It's all over!
Help.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.595
Yes, I crashed at Oliver's.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.224
Yes, I'm still homeless.
Yes, this is his least offensive robe.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.934
I've been on the phone all morning.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.103
Donna and Cliff have
pulled their financing!

07:18.187 --> 07:19.522
For "bail" and "defense attorneys,"

07:19.522 --> 07:21.149
some stupid shit like that!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.650
What about our great reviews?
One!

07:22.650 --> 07:25.570
One great review. Maxine.
The rest were middling, at best.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.531
- So we don't have to do it again?
- Charles, not helping.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.283
Last night, I was King of Broadway.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.493
A-And now, I'm in God's toilet!

07:32.493 --> 07:34.662
I wish I could drop dead right here!

07:34.662 --> 07:36.247
Oh, oh, and get this.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.249
I told my sweet Loretta the show's over,

07:38.249 --> 07:39.876
she's already flying off to LA tonight.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.836
She's got a TV gig lined up.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.713
Didn't you tell her to take that?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.465
I didn't think she would!

07:45.465 --> 07:47.175
Oh, I'm dizzy.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.968
The room is spinning.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.887
This is it.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.805
Th-The end of the road.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.433
Mama?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.726
Mama, I'm cold!

07:56.726 --> 07:59.479
Hey, I'm sorry about all this,
but it could be worse.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.690
All morning, I have been
hearing this whistling sound.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.902
I might have a brain tumor!

08:05.902 --> 08:07.987
Look, don't try to cheer me up.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.449
Guess who got a new puppy!

08:11.449 --> 08:15.328
Everybody, say hello to Gravey.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.787
Gravy?

08:16.787 --> 08:18.456
I just adopted her.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.416
I went looking for a cat,
and I came home with Gravey.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.627
The shelter won't let me
adopt any more cats.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.046
Apparently, I'm on a list.
I've hired a lawyer.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.006
Anyway, Sevelyn loves her.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.300
They sleep in the same bed
right on top of each other.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.552
So, Sevelyn's covered in Gravy?

08:31.552 --> 08:33.679
Yes, and I eat 'em both up.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.348
Don't I eat you up, Gravey?

08:35.348 --> 08:38.267
Yes, I do! Yes, I do!
I lap up all my Gravey!

08:38.267 --> 08:42.271
You know, Mabel, Gravey is retired.
She used to be a working girl.

08:42.271 --> 08:45.608
Really? What did she do?
They didn't tell me.

08:45.608 --> 08:49.654
But it got me thinking, we should do
a podcast about animals and their jobs.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.949
A-Are you pitching me right now?

08:52.949 --> 08:55.701
The world craves your content.
You need to be thinking about this.

08:55.701 --> 08:59.539
Uh, what I need is a place
to live and a real job.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.916
Oh! That's what it could be called.
"Animal Jobs."

09:01.916 --> 09:04.210
Oh my...

09:04.210 --> 09:07.338
- Ah!
- Uh, down! Down! Down, Gravey!

09:07.338 --> 09:09.966
- I-I've never seen her like this.
- In the two hours you've had her?

09:09.966 --> 09:12.843
I-I'm gonna take her for a walk.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.221
Mabel, think about that podcast.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.056
I'm pretty sure I won't.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.724
Come on, Gravey...

09:18.724 --> 09:20.601
Come on, girl. You're a good girl.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.688
I got another email from that Bev Melon.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.899
I did, too.
Do you think it's real?

09:26.899 --> 09:28.609
- Is what real?
- It looks kinda real.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.237
Yeah, but, like, the Paramount Studios?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.780
What are you talking about?

09:32.780 --> 09:34.991
They wanna make a movie of our podcast.

09:34.991 --> 09:38.160
They? Paramount? The pictures?

09:38.160 --> 09:41.080
They wanna fly us all out to LA
for some meeting next week.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.417
Hoe-dee-doe, I am back, baby!

09:44.417 --> 09:46.877
Fuck the theater!

09:46.877 --> 09:49.338
- I-I don't think I can go.
- What?

09:49.338 --> 09:51.382
Well, I'm worried about Sazz.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.218
Last night at the party,
she had something "sensitive"

09:54.218 --> 09:55.428
to discuss with me.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.515
And I keep hearing this whistling noise.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.268
Sazz is a whistler.
Did I ever tell you that?

10:02.268 --> 10:05.438
Sazz is a whistler?
Wow, Charles.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.149
How did you manage
to keep that riveting morsel to yourself?

10:09.734 --> 10:10.735
Hey.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.112
It's from Sazz.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.656
"Sorry, I had to jet off last minute

10:15.656 --> 10:18.534
"to cover Bakula on set...

10:18.534 --> 10:19.619
in LA."

10:19.619 --> 10:21.245
Well, isn't that rich?

10:21.245 --> 10:24.874
The best coast is calling
all of us, Charles, clearly.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.710
Pack your bags, bitches!

10:27.710 --> 10:29.920
We're going to Hollywood.
Oh no...

10:33.049 --> 10:34.717
<i>♪ 1989, that was the year ♪</i>

10:34.717 --> 10:37.720
<i>♪ Eight for the kick, nine for the snare,
parachute pants ♪</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:40.473
Yo, yo, yo, taxi!

10:40.473 --> 10:44.101
Hey! Come on!
What's a guy gotta do, huh?

10:44.101 --> 10:45.895
Hot dogs!

10:45.895 --> 10:47.605
Knishes!

10:47.605 --> 10:50.107
Polish sausage!

10:50.107 --> 10:52.568
Anthony!
You get your butt back in here, you!

10:52.568 --> 10:54.737
Your grandpa needs your help
with the microwave!

10:54.737 --> 10:57.073
Ma, come on! I'm late already!

10:57.073 --> 10:59.325
The Knicks can wait!
Your grandpa needs his Anthony!

11:03.162 --> 11:05.247
How can you not love New York?

11:05.247 --> 11:08.459
I don't wanna know
nobody who don't love New York City.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.671
Look up.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.214
Look up!

11:13.214 --> 11:15.675
Cut!

11:15.675 --> 11:18.886
You need to look up at the sky
and pretend you see Godzilla.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.597
Boy, they really nailed New York.
Godzilla?

11:21.597 --> 11:23.349
That lizard gets a lot of work.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.518
Okay, let's not get
our hopes up about this meeting.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.187
Bev Melon probably got handed
this project five minutes ago.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.856
Some higher-up at the studio
heard our podcast,

11:30.856 --> 11:32.858
- and now they wanna hear a pitch.
- Exactly.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.819
You better let us
take the lead on this, Mabel,

11:34.819 --> 11:38.364
'cause we have experience of,
you know, royalties and back-ends.

11:38.364 --> 11:42.410
I once had a hot minute
around Julie Andrews' backend.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.413
Julie Andrews is a goddess.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.915
I went too far.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.007
And here they are!

11:57.007 --> 11:59.593
Putting bodies to the voices
in our AirPods.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.138
I'm Bev Melon,
your persistent emailing maven.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.140
- So nice to meet all of you!
- Hello.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.100
Hi, I'm Monica Bernstein-D'Angelo,
VP of Marketing.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.728
Todd Shettinger, EVP International.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.771
I love you guys.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.606
Hey, Sal Snyder-Bernsdorf,

12:12.606 --> 12:15.109
Prez of Social. Obsessed.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.196
Okay, podcasters.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.532
Let's... talk... movies!

12:26.746 --> 12:29.582
This feels much further along
than we thought.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.668
When I see a hot piece of adaptable IP

12:32.668 --> 12:36.046
getting circled by a bunch
of horny rival studios,

12:36.046 --> 12:37.631
I go in hard,

12:37.631 --> 12:40.217
and I always finish first. Plus,

12:40.217 --> 12:44.221
we just landed the most
brilliant directing team.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.808
Hot off their big Grand Prix win at Cannes

12:47.808 --> 12:49.226
and their heart-wrenching,

12:49.226 --> 12:51.896
deeply, deeply viral Walmart ad campaign,

12:51.896 --> 12:55.149
I present to you the Brothers!

12:56.776 --> 12:59.403
I'm s-- I'm sorry. You're brothers?

12:59.403 --> 13:01.489
We're sisters.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.866
Oh, I-I thought I heard brothers.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.868
We're the Brothers sisters.
Mm-hmm.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.495
Trina and Tawny Brothers.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.331
And they're identical twins,
which is so neat.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.082
And when these gals read

13:12.082 --> 13:14.627
the fabulous script
that Marshall Peepope wrote...

13:14.627 --> 13:16.754
I-I was just trying to get
you all down in the right way.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.547
You know, just at least
how I pictured you.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.467
Oh, you are all
so distinctive on the page.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.761
Oliver, who we all want to strangle

13:23.761 --> 13:26.722
and cuddle at the same time.

13:26.722 --> 13:30.100
And Charles, everyone's un-fun uncle

13:30.100 --> 13:33.604
with his grouchy, little turtle face.

13:33.604 --> 13:37.399
And Mabel,
with your traumatized, homeless,

13:37.399 --> 13:40.694
jobless, mumbling millennial charm

13:40.694 --> 13:42.947
stuck between these two old dudes.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.908
It's so funny.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.369
I don't need an algorithm to tell me
that this is box office gold.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.329
But our algorithm confirms

13:50.329 --> 13:52.748
that it will be as long as it
comes out before Christmas.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.667
So, you're really making this film?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.502
Oh yes. We have a soft greenlight,

13:56.502 --> 13:58.379
and we're looking to harden that up today.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.340
The cast that has come
together for this film--

14:01.340 --> 14:02.675
You have a cast already?

14:02.675 --> 14:05.386
Oh, yes, ma'am.
We have a fabulous cast,

14:05.386 --> 14:08.389
and we'll get to that later tonight
at a big party for you all.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.391
But, first, I need you

14:10.391 --> 14:13.519
to officially hop aboard with us.
Guys?

14:14.478 --> 14:15.938
We wanna start shooting in three weeks,

14:15.938 --> 14:18.816
and your life rights are
the last thing we need, so...

14:18.816 --> 14:20.276
Gonna stop you right there, Bev.

14:20.276 --> 14:24.154
I think we understand the situation.
Uh, without us

14:24.822 --> 14:27.616
and our life rights, there's no film.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.577
So, what we need

14:29.577 --> 14:32.788
is a number that is fair--

14:32.788 --> 14:34.081
Oh, we don't need to do numbers.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.041
You can just have your
lawyers call business affairs.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.939
Okay, there we go.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.399
There we go,
okay, there we go.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.195
It's just a four.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.824
Four.
Four.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.326
That's right. Four.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.702
Four. Four...

15:12.995 --> 15:14.997
Four what? Four...

15:15.998 --> 15:18.834
thousand. Four...

15:18.834 --> 15:21.295
Four hundred. Four hundred...

15:21.295 --> 15:22.630
Four thousand...

15:23.547 --> 15:24.757
hundred.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.426
Forty-four hundred...

15:27.426 --> 15:28.928
million?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.096
Four million hundred?

15:31.096 --> 15:32.431
Or...

15:32.431 --> 15:34.099
Or five.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.517
- Five--
- Guys, whatever the number,

15:35.517 --> 15:36.936
we're gonna make it work.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.188
Uh, I'm sorry, can you excuse me?

15:39.188 --> 15:40.731
Wh-What's the matter, Mabel?

15:40.731 --> 15:44.193
I think, um, I just need a moment.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.493
- She may want a six.
- Uh-huh.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.496
Mabel?

16:01.085 --> 16:02.670
Howdy!

16:03.504 --> 16:04.755
There she is.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.632
Hey, Mabel!

16:06.632 --> 16:10.010
Hey.
- Are you okay?

16:10.010 --> 16:13.097
Oh, uh, just a little overwhelmed.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.893
This lot can do that, you know?

16:17.893 --> 16:20.354
The magic. The genius.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.816
I remember having a meeting right
over there with the great Robert Evans.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.569
He was filled with energy and ideas.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.655
And also cocaine,

16:29.655 --> 16:31.740
much of which was in
a condom he'd swallowed

16:31.740 --> 16:33.659
to get past airport security.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.036
Uh, no, it's not that.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.956
Just, did you hear how
they described me in there?

16:38.956 --> 16:42.251
Like, homeless, jobless, mumbling...

16:42.251 --> 16:44.837
- Speak up, dear, I can't hear you.
- I missed that last part.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.798
I'm not saying
it's completely inaccurate.

16:47.798 --> 16:51.343
But, if they make
a big movie about that Mabel,

16:51.343 --> 16:52.970
what if...

16:52.970 --> 16:55.347
I don't wanna
be that person forever?

16:55.347 --> 16:56.682
I know what you mean.

16:56.682 --> 17:00.519
Bev Melon called me an un-fun turtle.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.396
- Well--
- Un-fun. I mean,

17:02.396 --> 17:04.565
I'm fun! Right?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.692
Yeah.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.277
Sure...

17:08.944 --> 17:11.739
I mean, y-you're not fun for everyone,

17:11.739 --> 17:14.616
- but you-- but you are to us.
- No, no, no.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.243
Uh-huh! Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:16.243 --> 17:19.079
Look, I'm... I'm not saying no.

17:19.079 --> 17:23.125
I just, I need to think
about this big movie deal.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.209
Is that okay?

17:24.209 --> 17:26.420
Whatever you decide,
we'll stand behind you. Right, Oliver?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.547
Uh-huh...

17:29.506 --> 17:32.801
The studio is throwing
us a huge party tonight.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.220
I texted Loretta. She's coming.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.474
I need this.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.059
But, no pressure.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.518
Oliver, you're crushing me.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.395
- No pressure.
- Okay.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.022
I invited Sazz to the party,

17:45.022 --> 17:47.566
but she's back to not responding,
and she usually gets right back to me.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.193
Oh Jesus, Charles,

17:49.193 --> 17:51.487
enough with the boo-hoo-hoo, Mr. Un-fun.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.946
Oh, look!

17:52.946 --> 17:54.615
Hey, look, here comes fun!

17:54.615 --> 17:57.910
This is Sidney. He was my driver
during the old <i>Brazzos</i> days.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.329
He's gonna give us
a big tour of Hollywood.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.041
Hey, Sidney!

18:04.958 --> 18:06.543
Is Sidney alive?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.506
Hey, if you're worried about Sazz,

18:10.506 --> 18:13.008
why don't we just skip the tour
and stop by her place?

18:13.008 --> 18:15.803
Well, actually, Sazz's apartment complex

18:15.803 --> 18:17.721
belongs on a Hollywood tour.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.014
- Come on!
- And, frankly,

18:19.014 --> 18:21.266
the less stops for Sidney, the better.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.477
You know, he looks like
he's driving his own hearse.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.896
Although, I do have one place
I wanna go first.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.564
Well, let's get in this gas guzzler.

18:34.238 --> 18:38.200
<i>♪ Well, I'm goin' to California ♪</i>

18:38.867 --> 18:42.538

- No, they don't know you.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.185

19:15.863 --> 19:18.448
<i>♪ ...so nice in California ♪</i>

19:18.448 --> 19:21.201
I lived here during
season one of <i>Brazzos,</i>

19:21.201 --> 19:23.287
before Sazz took over my lease.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.881
This is the kind of place
that can only exist in Hollywood.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.966
Where celebrities take short-term leases

19:35.966 --> 19:38.510
next door to eccentrics
who've lived here for decades.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.097
Everyone from Scarlett Johansson
to the Black Dahlia.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.517
If these walls could talk, wow.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.063
Uh, when can I move in?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.447
This is it, Sazz's apartment.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.534
Sazz! Sazz!

20:19.176 --> 20:23.096
You know, maybe she's just away,
shooting on location with Bakula.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.265
That's right.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.393
No more worrying.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.312
No more un-fun turtle.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.484
Let's party.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.972
Wow, they're laying it on thick.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.015
Really trying to pressure
you to take that deal.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.893
Dude, they're here!
Where?

21:10.352 --> 21:11.728
Holy shit.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.359
Eugene! Zach!

21:17.359 --> 21:18.568
Zach!
Eva, over here!

21:20.696 --> 21:22.531
Pew!

21:22.531 --> 21:24.825
Charles, Oliver, and Mabel,

21:24.825 --> 21:26.660
this is, well,

21:26.660 --> 21:28.829
Charles, Oliver, and Mabel!

21:28.829 --> 21:30.330
I'm Eugene Levy?

21:31.373 --> 21:32.582
I'm Eva Longoria.

21:32.582 --> 21:33.959
Yeah.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.460
I'm...

21:36.920 --> 21:38.255
I wanna say Tim.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.841
- I'm Jack Black.
- Ah, that's it. Yeah.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.135
I'm not Jack Black.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.720
- Oliver, this is Zach Galifi--
- Oh, yes!

21:44.720 --> 21:46.847
Zach Galifragilistic, of course.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.557
Ha! I see what you're doing.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.101
People do this. You're trying
to <i>Between Two Ferns</i> me.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.103
Uh, between the whats?

21:53.103 --> 21:56.064
Okay, look. I might not be
a Desperate Housewife

21:56.064 --> 21:58.233
or Mr. Schitt's over here,

21:58.233 --> 22:01.403
but I happen to have starred in
the second-highest-grossing comedy

22:01.403 --> 22:03.697
of all freaking time!

22:05.949 --> 22:09.536
Are you the little boy from <i>Home Alone?</i>
What did they do to you!?

22:09.536 --> 22:10.662
I'm out. I'm done.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.873
- That is...
- What?

22:12.873 --> 22:16.209
Listen, I will greenlight
your dream project.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.337
<i>- Erin Brockovich,</i> but it's me.
- No.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.255
<i>- Legally Blonde,</i> but it's me.
- No.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.299
<i>- Spider-Man,</i> but it's me.
- Alright, fine.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.051
- The <i>Erin Brockovich</i> one.
- And I'm back.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.137
So, what kind of big names
were you hoping for?

22:28.263 --> 22:30.849
Okay, I'll let you all get
acquainted with one another.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.519
And, Mabel, I am here to talk to you
whenever you're ready.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.481
But first, tell me about
all these piercings! Oh, my gosh!

22:37.481 --> 22:38.565
I got a thousand questions

22:38.565 --> 22:39.649
- I would love to ask you.
- Sure.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.948
This is so flattering! I mean,

22:46.948 --> 22:49.159
the fact that anybody would look at me

22:49.159 --> 22:51.912
and think of Eva Longoria.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.747
Can I just ask you a question though?

22:53.747 --> 22:55.457
Oh, why they aged you up?

22:55.457 --> 22:58.502
Yeah, is that 'cause I-I'm an old soul?

22:58.502 --> 23:00.629
No. No, no.
They did a focus group

23:00.629 --> 23:03.131
on the age gap
between you and the guys,

23:03.131 --> 23:06.218
and the word that kept
coming up was "creepy."

23:07.719 --> 23:09.930
Plus, we're basically the same age.
I mean, look at us.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.558
And he was
such an unpredictable spirit.

23:13.558 --> 23:17.354
And you know who found him dead
was Candy Bergen.

23:17.354 --> 23:20.440
- Who's a chum, you know.
- Can I run something by you?

23:21.650 --> 23:24.653
I kind of have a risky take
on your character.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.948
I was thinking about
maybe playing him

23:27.948 --> 23:30.617
talented, successful,

23:30.617 --> 23:33.537
completely aware
that it's the year 2024.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.871
Oh.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.124
Well, I'm so excited.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.000
This is gonna be an amazing project,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.920
and I still can't believe I'm playing you.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.923
- Yeah.
- 'Cause <i>Brazzos</i> was huge in Canada.

23:44.923 --> 23:48.802
I actually dubbed your voice
for the French version in Quebec.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.644
You know-- You know what? I'm sorry.
I'm a little bit distracted.

23:57.644 --> 24:00.272
I haven't heard from a good friend
in a few days,

24:00.272 --> 24:01.648
and I'm a little worried.

24:01.648 --> 24:04.651
I'm sorry, I'm just
a little distracted right now.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.737
I haven't heard from a good friend
of mine in a few days,

24:07.737 --> 24:10.490
just a little worried. [laughs] Nobody...

24:10.490 --> 24:12.159
does "a little worried" like you.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.828
Oh, no. That's not me.

24:14.828 --> 24:17.831
I'm usually way more fun!
I'm more like,

24:17.831 --> 24:20.709
"Hey! I haven't heard
from my good friend for a few days,

24:20.709 --> 24:24.754
but you know what?
Everything's gonna be totally fine! Woo!"

24:26.715 --> 24:28.008
Well, at our age,

24:28.008 --> 24:30.260
no one's ever really totally fine, are we?

24:30.260 --> 24:32.053
You know what everyone's got now?

24:32.053 --> 24:33.263
Sepsis.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.891
Oh, excuse-- Oh, my God,
there's my old friend

24:35.891 --> 24:37.476
Bill [gibberish].

24:43.440 --> 24:46.902
My brain cannot get around
what you are delaying about this for.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.488
Why is this not the greatest
opportunity in the world?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.072
Woo-hoo!

24:52.657 --> 24:53.909
Hi!

24:54.576 --> 24:56.453
Oh, my God.
- Hi...

24:56.453 --> 24:57.746
Hi.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.498
Look at you!
- Hi. Oh.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.876
You're a vision! Mwah!
Oh, my God, I missed you. Look at you!

25:04.878 --> 25:06.838
What a long cold winter
it's been without you.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.590
Oliver, it's been, like, five days.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.842
And, you know, I texted you
about five times in the last week.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.677
Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry.
I texted you twice,

25:12.677 --> 25:14.054
- but I'm so sorry...
- Well, I didn't get--

25:14.054 --> 25:15.514
...because
I've been just crazed, you know?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.224
Okay, well, just
tell me everything.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.309
- Yeah.
- How's work? How's life? How's...

25:19.309 --> 25:21.520
the constant sunshine?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.813
- Well, work is a dream, of course.
- Yeah.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.941
Because I love everybody
at Gnorfbun so much.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.026
- I'm sorry? What's Gnorfbun?
- No--

25:28.026 --> 25:32.030
That's what we call <i>Grey's New Orleans
Family Burn Unit</i> for short.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.698
Oh, yeah.
- Except we have to explain it

25:33.698 --> 25:35.116
every time we say it.

25:35.116 --> 25:38.411
But [sighs],
they've all been so welcoming to me.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.872
But tonight isn't about me!

25:40.872 --> 25:43.375
Oh, my God, a film?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.460
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.421
Who could've imagined, a week ago,

25:48.421 --> 25:50.674
we would all be Hollywood-bound?

25:50.674 --> 25:53.552
Yeah. Isn't that wild, Mabel?
Yeah.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.929
You okay? Is everything--

25:55.929 --> 25:57.681
I'm gonna go to the bar.
Oh.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.559
You know, if you have
trouble deciding what you want,

26:00.559 --> 26:02.936
uh, just remember my life depends on it.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.276
Um, I'll have a--

26:09.276 --> 26:11.027
We'll have two tequilas on ice,

26:11.027 --> 26:14.114
hold the lime, and put some of
those cute, tiny umbrellas in.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.035
So, studio says you're holding out.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.914
Oh... No, I just needed some time

26:22.914 --> 26:26.001
to think about the whole
life rights thing. I'm sorry.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.669
Don't apologize.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.130
The script makes you
sound like a sad sack,

26:30.130 --> 26:32.132
and here you are, squeezing the studio.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.301
I'm just trying to learn your character.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.178
Believe me, so am I.

26:37.178 --> 26:38.930
Anyway, I don't even know what I've done

26:38.930 --> 26:41.474
to become a character in a movie.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.853
Look, honey, when I was your age,

26:44.853 --> 26:46.730
a couple years ago,

26:46.730 --> 26:49.149
I found myself at a crossroads.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.900
You know, I was making great money acting,

26:50.900 --> 26:52.360
but I knew I wanted to do more.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.821
I wanted to produce, I wanted to direct,

26:55.822 --> 26:58.325
I wanted to sell skin cream,
and ice cream,

26:58.325 --> 27:01.411
and underwear, and sportswear,

27:01.411 --> 27:05.081
beer, computers, tequila,

27:05.457 --> 27:06.750
and gin.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.209
And I did.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.755
I'm not telling you to sell
your life rights. But, if you do,

27:13.006 --> 27:14.924
ask them for a shit-ton of money

27:14.924 --> 27:17.552
and then build something with it.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.513
Just not tequila 'cause that's mine.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.479
So sorry about <i>Death Rattle.</i>

27:27.479 --> 27:29.230
Oh, Broadway.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.940
Stupid racket.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.692
Now, Hollywood...

27:32.692 --> 27:35.070
Hollywood has never let me down.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.280
Except for the time when they removed

27:37.280 --> 27:38.948
my star from the Walk of Fame

27:38.948 --> 27:41.201
because they said I had
no right to just put it there, you know.

27:43.745 --> 27:46.331
- Yeah.
- Bastards, yeah.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.803
Sazz?

28:04.557 --> 28:06.726
Since the podcast is on hiatus,

28:06.726 --> 28:08.019
and the musical is...

28:08.019 --> 28:09.562
well, dead,

28:10.563 --> 28:14.192
would you consider maybe coming...
out here?

28:17.654 --> 28:19.030
Um--
Uh, I mean...

28:19.030 --> 28:21.366
No, I mean--
But, honestly, with my hours,

28:21.366 --> 28:24.035
we'd probably hardly ever
see each other, so...

28:24.035 --> 28:27.956
No, no, no, I would. I would.
I-I could definitely consider that. I-I--

28:29.290 --> 28:30.291
I ju--

28:31.126 --> 28:32.794
I just feel like I'm...

28:34.421 --> 28:36.631
watching you...

28:36.631 --> 28:39.217
take off and fly away, and I just...

28:41.803 --> 28:43.471
I hope I can keep up with you.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.684
Oh. I'm so in love with you.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.770
Oliver...

28:53.565 --> 28:55.483
Loretta, will you...

28:57.152 --> 28:58.945
Will what? Would I what?

28:58.945 --> 29:02.031
Just give me time to think about...

29:03.199 --> 29:04.701
LA? Coming to LA?
I just--

29:04.701 --> 29:07.120
- Oh, sure.
- I-It's a huge decision.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.498
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- But, I-I'm-- I'm not against it.

29:10.498 --> 29:14.252
- You know, I'm just-- just-- I'm just--
- Well, I mean, we have loads of time.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.588
- Yeah, yeah. So, just...
- So...

29:18.465 --> 29:20.341
Yeah, we'll figure something out.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.844
And I love you, too.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.652
Do you have a minute?

29:40.195 --> 29:41.404
Ah!

29:41.404 --> 29:44.240
I have been waiting to
have a minute with you all day!

29:47.660 --> 29:49.162
Do you-- Do you mind if I observe?

29:49.162 --> 29:52.499
Research. I'm just--
I'm just a fly on the wall.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.879
Look, I know you thought you could wow me

29:57.879 --> 30:01.174
with your presentation and your stars,

30:01.174 --> 30:04.052
and I would just agree to whatever deal
you put in front of me,

30:04.052 --> 30:07.263
but that's not how I do things.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.015
Jesus, that's going in the script.

30:09.015 --> 30:10.892
Shit, sorry. Fly, wall.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.354
What's it gonna take, Mabel?

30:20.610 --> 30:22.028
Oh, fuck.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.574
Hey, Sazz!

30:27.992 --> 30:29.410
Oh.

30:29.744 --> 30:30.870
Bakula.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.956
Hey, Charles.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.958
Congratulations.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.044
It was nice to see another white-haired
white guy beat the odds.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.798
Well, thanks. I mean, kind of.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.259
Um, hey, how's Joy?
Great.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.387
She actually just sent me a photo,

30:47.387 --> 30:48.721
and--

30:48.721 --> 30:50.473
But I can't show it to you.

30:52.183 --> 30:55.520
Hey, uh, Scott, I'm glad you're here.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.021
Have you seen Sazz?

30:57.021 --> 30:58.773
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

30:58.773 --> 31:01.568
She was supposed to
double me on this pilot

31:01.568 --> 31:04.153
we shot last week,
but she never showed.

31:04.153 --> 31:06.739
That's not like her.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.917
No pressure!

31:19.502 --> 31:21.087
Oh, thank God.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.923
I never doubted you for a second.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.633
Let's go find Charles.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.302
I have some news.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.849
Not the fun kind.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.305
Sazz?

32:14.182 --> 32:15.224
Sazz?

32:15.767 --> 32:16.809
Don't hit the--

32:19.228 --> 32:20.939
Hey, what are these?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.607
Sazz's pride and joy.

32:22.607 --> 32:25.693
It's a shrine to all the bones
she's broken on the job.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.362
"My First Big Break."

32:27.362 --> 32:29.781
She's had so many
joints replaced by metal.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.076
Apparently, the best ones
come from Bulgaria.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.953
She only gets 'em from there.
Bulgaria.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.915
I once spent a week in Bulgaria
with Twiggy and Tommy Tune.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.250
I've never felt both so fat and short.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.336
Sazz!

32:44.295 --> 32:47.048
You there?

32:54.347 --> 32:56.724
It's Howard.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.904
The hell? What's all this?

33:17.036 --> 33:19.080
"Looking at Charles."

33:21.666 --> 33:23.584
Where is she?

33:27.714 --> 33:28.715
Yeah?

33:28.715 --> 33:30.425
<i>Hey, Charles, it's Lester.</i>

33:30.425 --> 33:33.678
I got your note here about
changing out your glass.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.931
But, I-I couldn't get it done today.
First thing tomorrow.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.516
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.351
What note?
<i>A note.</i>

33:40.351 --> 33:42.353
I got it today at the desk,

33:42.353 --> 33:44.647
<i>saying you need
your kitchen window replaced.</i>

33:44.647 --> 33:45.898
<i>Maybe a bird hit it</i>

33:45.898 --> 33:48.443
or something left a little hole.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.195
Hear that whistling?

33:52.947 --> 33:56.284
Hold on. How small was that hole?

33:56.284 --> 33:58.036
Like a bullet hole?

33:58.036 --> 34:01.122
Nah, i-it can't be.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.292
Well...

34:04.292 --> 34:06.669
Lester, don't touch that window.

34:13.509 --> 34:17.013
Ah!

34:18.014 --> 34:19.891
- Oh, my God, you guys.
- What?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.809
We need to get back to New York.

34:24.270 --> 34:28.232
<i>A great movie moment
can live in your head forever.</i>

34:28.232 --> 34:31.027
<i>The opening of</i>
Once Upon a Time in the West

34:31.027 --> 34:34.697
<i>is seven minutes of nothing
but sounds and images.</i>

34:35.490 --> 34:37.116
<i>But once you see it,</i>

34:37.116 --> 34:39.118
<i>you never forget it.</i>
