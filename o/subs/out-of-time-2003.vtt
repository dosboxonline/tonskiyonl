01:36.500 --> 01:39.502
<i>In St. Petersburg,</i>
<i>Florida, this 52-year-old man</i>

01:39.504 --> 01:43.473
<i>lets these two young women</i>
<i>into the house.</i>

01:43.475 --> 01:45.142
<i>They lifted up their tops,</i>

01:45.144 --> 01:47.610
<i>exposed themselves</i>
<i>to the guy...</i>

01:47.612 --> 01:49.012
Chief Whitlock.

01:49.014 --> 01:54.451
<i>Chief Whitlock, it's Ann.</i>
<i>Ann Merai Harrison.</i>

01:54.453 --> 01:56.619
<i>Somebody just</i>
<i>broke into my house.</i>

01:56.621 --> 01:58.555
All right.
Be right over, ma'am.

02:10.235 --> 02:12.535
<i>...on the corner</i>
<i>of Church and Waterford.</i>

02:25.083 --> 02:27.417
How you doing,
Miss Harrison?

02:27.419 --> 02:28.718
Chief.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.987
You okay?

02:29.989 --> 02:31.355
I'm fine.

02:31.357 --> 02:32.689
Mind if I come in?

02:32.691 --> 02:33.991
Come in.
Thank you.

02:35.927 --> 02:37.060
Oh, boy.

02:41.432 --> 02:45.769
Did you, uh... you get a
good look at this fella?

02:45.771 --> 02:47.704
Uh, yeah.

02:48.773 --> 02:51.275
He was, um...
About your height.

02:51.277 --> 02:52.542
Mm-hmm.

02:53.611 --> 02:55.078
Your weight.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.580
Come to think of it,
he kind of looked like you.

02:57.582 --> 02:59.816
Looked like me?
So he was good-looking?

02:59.818 --> 03:00.918
No.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.319
Okay.

03:02.321 --> 03:04.187
Sorry. Just not my type.

03:05.957 --> 03:08.425
So this "ugly" man--

03:08.427 --> 03:10.760
you know how he got
in the house?

03:10.762 --> 03:13.730
Um...

03:13.732 --> 03:15.065
The bedroom window.

03:28.379 --> 03:30.613
It's all right
if I come in your bedroom?

03:30.615 --> 03:32.115
Yeah. Come in.

03:32.117 --> 03:34.151
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

03:34.153 --> 03:37.421
Okay. I was asleep.

03:37.423 --> 03:41.291
But, um, then I woke up
'cause I felt something.

03:41.293 --> 03:43.460
I saw the window was open...

03:44.996 --> 03:49.099
And he was standing
right where you are.

03:49.101 --> 03:50.900
Right here?
Mm-hmm.

03:50.902 --> 03:53.937
You sure? Okay...

03:53.939 --> 03:55.672
All right,
so what did he do?

03:55.674 --> 03:58.976
He, uh...
He came toward me.

03:58.978 --> 04:01.445
He came toward you?
Uh-huh.

04:01.447 --> 04:03.246
Like this?

04:03.248 --> 04:04.481
Uh-huh.

04:05.583 --> 04:08.551
Then he grabbed me.
Where?

04:08.553 --> 04:09.987
Right here.

04:11.222 --> 04:13.556
Like that?
Uh-huh.

04:13.558 --> 04:17.327
But he was much stronger than you.

04:17.329 --> 04:19.396
Like that?
Uh-huh.

04:19.398 --> 04:22.199
He forced himself
on top of me.

04:22.201 --> 04:23.300
Like that?

04:23.302 --> 04:25.268
His breath smelled like

04:25.270 --> 04:27.904
he'd been drinking on the
job, kind of like yours.

04:27.906 --> 04:29.772
Really?
What happened next?

04:29.774 --> 04:31.908
He kissed me.
Where?

04:33.577 --> 04:34.911
Where, baby?

04:39.250 --> 04:41.918
And he stripped me naked.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.953
I was confused.
He ripped my shirt off.

04:51.429 --> 04:55.098
You didn't put up
much of a fight, did you?

04:55.100 --> 04:56.366
Oh, really?

04:58.269 --> 05:01.604
I didn't put up
much of a fight?

05:01.606 --> 05:03.206
So you took control?

05:03.208 --> 05:06.910
What did you do next?
What did you do, baby?

05:06.912 --> 05:08.311
Watch me.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.314
Tell me what
you did next, baby.

05:15.786 --> 05:17.487
Oh...

05:17.489 --> 05:21.058
<i>Chief, you've got
to get down to the scuttlebutt.</i>

05:21.060 --> 05:23.726
<i>We've got a situation here.</i>
<i>It's about to blow.</i>

05:23.728 --> 05:25.995
<i>Chief?</i>

05:25.997 --> 05:29.199
Yeah, Tony, what's up?
<i>Where are you, chief?</i>

05:29.201 --> 05:31.901
<i>Can you get here?
We need you to come quick.</i>

05:33.404 --> 05:34.604
<i>Chief?</i>

05:34.606 --> 05:37.006
Okay. Um...

05:38.109 --> 05:40.510
Look, Tony, I'm...

05:41.579 --> 05:42.912
Coming now.

05:42.914 --> 05:44.814
No.
I've got to go, baby.

05:44.816 --> 05:49.086
I've got to go.
I've got to go to work.

05:50.588 --> 05:53.756
So we'll pick up
on this crime tomorrow?

05:53.758 --> 05:54.958
Okay.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.393
What kind of crime?

05:56.395 --> 05:58.595
Assault with
a deadly weapon.

05:58.597 --> 06:02.699
Breaking and entering.
See you later, baby.

07:39.564 --> 07:40.763
How y'all doing?

07:40.765 --> 07:41.898
Good, chief.
Matt.

07:45.403 --> 07:46.503
Morning.
Hey, Matt.

07:59.950 --> 08:02.586
Mathias Lee Whitlock.

08:02.588 --> 08:04.854
How you doing, Chris?

08:04.856 --> 08:08.124
You having breakfast
with all your friends here?

08:09.860 --> 08:13.563
I would invite you, Chris,
but I don't want to.

08:14.665 --> 08:18.868
I'd sit down,
but I don't want to.

08:18.870 --> 08:20.737
Did they
find us a table?

08:20.739 --> 08:24.407
Yeah, we're in the back.
Matt.

08:24.409 --> 08:27.877
How you doing, Ann?
Okay. I'm starving.

08:27.879 --> 08:30.313
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

08:30.315 --> 08:33.482
Hey, Chris, try the crab.
It's real good.

08:33.485 --> 08:34.784
I'm allergic.

08:34.785 --> 08:36.052
I know.

08:40.390 --> 08:41.823
Right.

09:14.091 --> 09:16.192
How you doing, Sharlene?
Hey, chief.

09:16.194 --> 09:18.027
What time is it?
It's 3:00.

09:18.029 --> 09:19.596
3:00. Let's go.

09:20.698 --> 09:23.866
Hey, man, you're
out of paper towels again.

09:23.868 --> 09:26.703
How you doing, Chae?
Good.

09:26.705 --> 09:29.205
Thought the camera
only added ten pounds.

09:29.207 --> 09:32.475
Looks good, doesn't it?
Kind of, in a pudgy way.

09:34.044 --> 09:35.878
I thought this might
be an opportune time

09:35.880 --> 09:38.381
to revisit my offer to invest
in that little business venture.

09:38.383 --> 09:40.650
Costa Rica?
Yeah. Chartered fishing boat.

09:40.652 --> 09:41.984
Steal the evidence money?

09:41.986 --> 09:45.054
What's this?
You file a report on that yet?

09:45.056 --> 09:46.556
Is that it?
That's it.

09:46.558 --> 09:49.225
485 grand.
Can I touch it?

09:49.227 --> 09:51.728
No, you can't.
I just want to touch it.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.330
Get your hands out of there.

09:54.732 --> 09:57.500
Maybe I'll just steal it.
Maybe I'll just shoot you.

09:57.502 --> 10:01.137
Stop thinking like a cop.
Just listen to my proposition.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.442
We'll take a grand out.
We'll go to the boat show.

10:05.444 --> 10:08.177
We'll just walk around
with the money in our pocket,

10:08.179 --> 10:10.179
get a sense
of what it feels like

10:10.181 --> 10:12.449
to know we could buy a boat,
if we were of a mind to.

10:12.451 --> 10:15.618
I'll see you in a minute.
What do you think?

10:20.458 --> 10:21.924
Chae.
Stranger.

10:21.926 --> 10:23.059
How you doing?

10:23.061 --> 10:26.429
How you doing, Alex?
I need your keys.

10:26.431 --> 10:28.898
I'm fine, thanks for asking.
How about you?

10:28.900 --> 10:31.901
Listen, I need your keys.
I left a couple of things.

10:31.903 --> 10:35.605
Okay. I'll go with you.
No. Uh-uh.

10:35.607 --> 10:38.541
Why not?
I just want to go with you.

10:38.543 --> 10:40.543
I don't want to get into anything.

10:40.545 --> 10:42.945
I've got a lot of work to do.

10:42.947 --> 10:46.015
I know your work is important.
Are you going to start with that?

10:46.017 --> 10:49.753
I'm gonna go in the other room and
pretend to make a phone call.

10:49.755 --> 10:53.456
Congrats on making detective.
Thanks, Chae.

10:54.558 --> 10:56.459
Forget it.
Forget it.

10:56.461 --> 10:58.695
Even if I left the
hope diamond in there,

10:58.697 --> 11:00.229
it's just not worth it.

11:01.899 --> 11:02.965
Bye, Matt.

11:02.967 --> 11:04.434
Good-bye, Alex.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.741
Would you just give me
the goddamn keys?

11:11.743 --> 11:14.043
They're on the desk
right in front of you.

11:16.079 --> 11:17.480
I'll drop them off.

11:17.482 --> 11:18.548
Oh!

11:20.951 --> 11:24.020
See you, Chae.
See you, sweetie.

11:29.276 --> 11:30.776
She looks good.

11:30.778 --> 11:33.346
Sometimes I think you
want me to shoot you, Chae.

11:34.516 --> 11:35.948
Wait. Hold that thought.

11:38.619 --> 11:39.885
Medical examiner.

11:41.622 --> 11:44.023
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

11:44.025 --> 11:46.859
What kind of prick dies
at cocktail hour on a Friday?

11:46.861 --> 11:50.230
The nerve of some people.
Have a good one, Chae.

11:50.232 --> 11:51.598
Yeah, see you.

12:23.764 --> 12:25.231
Catch anything?

12:26.300 --> 12:28.168
Hey!
Hey.

12:28.170 --> 12:32.505
Trying to catch my self-respect.
Figuring out what it is I'm doing

12:32.507 --> 12:34.240
in the middle of
this...threesome.

12:34.242 --> 12:37.610
Try foursome.
You're forgetting your wife.

12:37.612 --> 12:39.779
She left me.

12:39.781 --> 12:42.515
I told her the other day--
I told her today--

12:42.517 --> 12:44.717
come get her stuff.

12:44.719 --> 12:47.287
So, how's the pro
football quarterback?

12:47.289 --> 12:49.422
He's up north
hunting for the weekend.

12:52.459 --> 12:54.394
The whole weekend.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.771
I got a splinter
in my butt.

13:38.773 --> 13:40.773
You okay?

13:40.775 --> 13:44.277
I'm okay.
I'm definitely okay.

13:44.279 --> 13:45.545
It's all right.

13:48.616 --> 13:51.451
You still love her, don't you?
Huh?

13:51.453 --> 13:53.553
You still love her,
don't you?

13:54.622 --> 13:56.289
Yeah, I do.

13:56.291 --> 14:00.126
Yeah, you do. Will you divorce her?
You still got your ring on.

14:00.128 --> 14:02.762
Chris needs me.
Oh, okay.

14:02.764 --> 14:05.231
He does.

14:05.233 --> 14:09.034
He's lost, been that way
since he got cut from the team.

14:10.304 --> 14:11.804
I feel sorry for him.

14:11.806 --> 14:15.275
Remember that the next time
he goes upside your head.

14:25.419 --> 14:26.686
Hello.

14:28.221 --> 14:29.389
Mm-hmm.

14:34.127 --> 14:35.961
Okay. Sure.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.867
All right.
I'll be right there.

15:11.898 --> 15:14.867
Ann Merai. Hi.
Dr. Frieland.

15:14.869 --> 15:17.770
This is my brother Matt.
Nice to meet you.

15:17.772 --> 15:19.672
I'm sorry to
bring you in today.

15:19.674 --> 15:21.607
I was in surgery all day yesterday.
Please.

15:22.909 --> 15:26.629
You can talk in front of him.
It's fine.

15:26.631 --> 15:27.380
Okay.

15:35.756 --> 15:37.824
Right. Okay.

15:37.826 --> 15:42.061
Ann, I'm afraid there's been
a bit of a setback.

15:43.930 --> 15:46.198
I had your tests back yesterday.

15:50.270 --> 15:54.039
The cancer is not in remission.
It's come back very aggressively.

15:54.041 --> 15:56.442
It's attacked
your liver and lungs.

16:07.888 --> 16:10.390
How--how long?

16:10.392 --> 16:13.626
Well, that's difficult to say.

16:13.628 --> 16:15.661
How long?

16:16.881 --> 16:18.431
Five, six months.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.232
No one can say for sure.

16:29.743 --> 16:31.644
But I feel--
I feel fine.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.117
Listen...

16:38.119 --> 16:40.653
There's a counselor here
at the hospital

16:40.655 --> 16:42.488
I'd like you to see.

16:42.490 --> 16:45.758
She's very good.
She'll help you during this period.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.993
Thank you for coming in
on your day off.

16:47.995 --> 16:49.429
Ann, wait.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.233
Excuse me.

16:54.235 --> 16:57.937
Maybe you could speak to
her about the counseling?

16:57.939 --> 17:01.758
Listen, you should be able
to do something, right?

17:01.760 --> 17:05.411
What about that experimental stuff?
You know, like <i>60 Minutes?</i>

17:07.012 --> 17:08.380
I don't know.

17:08.382 --> 17:11.383
I mean, there are
alternative approaches.

17:11.385 --> 17:12.551
Yeah?
Sure.

17:12.554 --> 17:15.454
I mean, let's see...

17:15.457 --> 17:19.325
Autologous cancer vaccines,
hematology procedures,

17:19.327 --> 17:22.561
hyperthermia treatments.

17:22.564 --> 17:24.597
Here. Take a look at those.

17:24.598 --> 17:28.300
They're extremely expensive,
and there are no guarantees.

17:30.504 --> 17:32.304
Thanks.
Okay.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.245
You all right?

17:40.247 --> 17:42.365
Yeah.

17:42.367 --> 17:45.084
Why didn't you tell me, baby?

17:45.086 --> 17:46.652
I'm sorry.

17:46.654 --> 17:48.153
I'm sorry.

17:48.155 --> 17:51.757
When I was with you, I--

17:51.759 --> 17:53.258
I forgot about it.

17:53.260 --> 17:57.096
For a couple hours,
I didn't think about dying.

17:57.098 --> 17:58.831
I understand.

18:08.375 --> 18:11.043
You know, they've got
this alternative stuff.

18:11.045 --> 18:13.412
There's a clinic in
Switzerland, and they say--

18:13.414 --> 18:15.047
I know. With my blood.

18:15.049 --> 18:18.217
I don't put much stock
in all that stuff.

18:18.219 --> 18:21.186
They said there's
a 17% success rate.

18:21.188 --> 18:23.756
A whole 17%?

18:23.758 --> 18:25.725
Odds are better
I'd hit the lottery,

18:25.727 --> 18:29.361
which is what I'd have to do
to afford something like that.

18:37.437 --> 18:39.739
Now listen.

18:39.741 --> 18:41.240
Where are you going?

18:41.242 --> 18:43.643
I don't think we should
do this anymore.

18:43.645 --> 18:44.911
Ann. Ann.

18:44.913 --> 18:47.847
It wasn't right for me
to drag you into this.

18:51.251 --> 18:55.187
You didn't drag me into anything.
I'm a big boy.

18:55.189 --> 18:59.191
Matt, I'm dying.
I'm dying.

19:12.940 --> 19:15.741
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

19:15.743 --> 19:18.044
The girls at work
were so jealous.

19:18.046 --> 19:20.880
Glad to hear that. I know
that's not why you called me.

19:20.882 --> 19:22.048
What's up?
What's up?

19:22.050 --> 19:24.784
I wanted to show you
something.

19:26.219 --> 19:28.654
Chris didn't hit you
again, did he?

19:28.656 --> 19:29.889
No.

19:30.958 --> 19:32.692
When we were married,

19:32.694 --> 19:35.695
we took out insurance policies
on each other,

19:35.697 --> 19:38.197
but they were only
for $100,000.

19:38.199 --> 19:41.567
This says $1 million.
Did you know about this?

19:41.569 --> 19:44.570
No. I remember
signing some things,

19:44.572 --> 19:46.939
but I didn't know
he made any changes.

19:46.941 --> 19:50.342
He can't get away with this.
This is fraud. You were sick.

19:50.344 --> 19:53.713
No. I was diagnosed
six months ago.

19:53.715 --> 19:56.082
Chris increased the policy
almost a year ago,

19:56.084 --> 19:58.350
right after my 32nd birthday.

20:00.754 --> 20:03.723
My mother was 33
when she died of cancer.

20:07.427 --> 20:08.894
Oh, no.

20:11.397 --> 20:14.533
That Chris?
He's here.

20:14.535 --> 20:16.702
Maybe he can explain this.
No.

20:16.704 --> 20:19.505
Why not? Now's the time.
This is not the time.

20:19.507 --> 20:22.108
When is the time?
I don't know.

20:22.110 --> 20:24.176
Please. I'm sorry, baby.

20:32.285 --> 20:34.086
Hey.
Hey.

20:34.088 --> 20:36.455
I'm just taking the trash out.

20:36.457 --> 20:38.658
Thought you were working
a double tonight.

20:43.797 --> 20:45.564
Yeah, I bet you did.

20:54.541 --> 20:56.942
How was your appointment
on Saturday?

20:58.145 --> 21:00.746
Appointment?
Yeah, with Dr. Frieland.

21:00.748 --> 21:03.515
I didn't have an appointment.

21:03.517 --> 21:07.019
No? You sure?
I'm sure.

21:07.021 --> 21:09.989
'Cause Jay saw you
go inside his office.

21:09.991 --> 21:12.091
You were going inside
with some other guy.

21:12.093 --> 21:14.760
No, I just stopped by.
I had to ask some questions.

21:14.762 --> 21:16.095
Now you were there.

21:16.097 --> 21:19.098
I was there, but I had
to ask him some questions.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.933
Here we go
with the lies again.

21:20.935 --> 21:23.002
I'm not lying to you.
Yes, you are!

21:23.004 --> 21:25.437
Start telling me the truth!

21:25.439 --> 21:29.441
You're hurting me!
Why do you make me do this?

21:29.443 --> 21:31.443
I'm not making you
do anything!

21:31.445 --> 21:35.414
It ain't my goddamn fault!
It ain't my fault!

21:42.488 --> 21:44.690
Chris, how you doing,
football player?

21:44.692 --> 21:46.491
Good, Mathias.
How you doing?

21:46.493 --> 21:48.393
I'm good.
Judy Anderson called,

21:48.395 --> 21:50.796
said she saw a prowler
in the neighborhood.

21:50.798 --> 21:52.064
You see anything?

21:52.066 --> 21:53.599
Nah.

21:53.601 --> 21:54.934
No?
Mm-mmm.

21:54.936 --> 21:56.836
What about your wife?
She home?

21:56.838 --> 21:58.670
She didn't see anything.

21:58.672 --> 22:00.906
You didn't ask her, Chris.

22:00.908 --> 22:02.574
She didn't say anything
about it.

22:02.576 --> 22:05.510
Maybe I should ask her, not that
I don't trust your mind-reading.

22:05.512 --> 22:08.748
Hey, Ann, how you doing?
I didn't see anything.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.382
Okay?
Okay.

22:10.384 --> 22:12.118
I'm gonna just
check the perimeter.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.418
Go ahead.

22:13.420 --> 22:15.520
You see somebody, you holler, okay?
Oh, yeah.

22:15.522 --> 22:17.456
Ann?
Mm-hmm.

22:18.759 --> 22:20.760
You have a good night.

22:24.030 --> 22:26.899
We did it.
This wasn't necessary.

22:26.901 --> 22:31.536
My name shouldn't be on your house.
I'll buy my own in a few years.

22:34.307 --> 22:35.808
All right.

22:40.113 --> 22:41.346
Chief Whitlock.

22:41.348 --> 22:44.616
<i>Hey, baby, it's me.</i>
<i>What time you get off?</i>

22:44.618 --> 22:47.153
<i>I've found a way to go to
that clinic in Switzerland.</i>

22:47.155 --> 22:49.288
Right.
<i>Can you talk?</i>

22:49.290 --> 22:50.990
Hold on.
Forget it.

22:50.992 --> 22:52.858
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

22:52.860 --> 22:56.595
You know, I got to go.
Tell her I say hi. Bye.

23:04.504 --> 23:05.737
Hello.

23:05.739 --> 23:07.572
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>
<i>Can you talk?</i>

23:07.574 --> 23:09.074
Yeah. It's no problem.

23:09.076 --> 23:11.977
<i>You got to hear this.</i>
<i>It's incredible.</i>

23:11.979 --> 23:16.081
I name you the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.917
No, no.
Not me personally.

23:17.919 --> 23:21.453
You name the living gift
as your beneficiary

23:21.455 --> 23:23.639
after we purchase
the policy from you.

23:23.641 --> 23:26.491
And you--
I mean, the living gift--

23:26.493 --> 23:28.360
collects on the policy
when I die.

23:28.362 --> 23:31.213
As the beneficiary, yes,
we collect on the policy.

23:31.215 --> 23:33.532
So you make
a profit if she dies?

23:33.534 --> 23:36.368
Is that legal?
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

23:36.370 --> 23:38.003
How much do I get?

23:38.005 --> 23:39.538
I know the amount depends on

23:39.540 --> 23:42.007
how long your medical staff
says I have to live.

23:42.009 --> 23:44.076
How about a ballpark figure?

23:44.078 --> 23:47.713
$750,000.
I know.

23:47.715 --> 23:50.449
Even if they have to repeat
the treatment several times,

23:50.451 --> 23:53.618
there would still be enough money
left over for us to go somewhere.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.222
Like the conch festival
in key west?

23:57.457 --> 23:58.790
No.

23:58.792 --> 24:01.126
Clambake in Opa Locka?

24:01.128 --> 24:04.563
No! Europe.
Europe?

24:04.565 --> 24:07.032
Yeah. Or Africa.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.181
I'm going to beat this.

24:24.751 --> 24:26.552
You watch.

24:28.655 --> 24:30.356
Richard petty,
give me a hand.

24:42.269 --> 24:45.938
Hey, man, watch it.
Don't slip. Watch that blood.

24:57.784 --> 25:00.252
Come on, Ann, talk to me.

25:00.254 --> 25:03.389
Their investors won't let them
buy any new policies.

25:03.391 --> 25:04.556
The living gift?

25:04.558 --> 25:05.657
Mm-hmm.

25:06.726 --> 25:08.460
We can go somewhere else.

25:08.462 --> 25:10.296
We'll get somebody else
to buy it.

25:10.298 --> 25:12.864
I can't. There's only
two days left to change it.

25:12.866 --> 25:14.233
What do you mean?

25:14.235 --> 25:17.069
A provision says the beneficiary
can't be changed after a year,

25:17.071 --> 25:18.370
and that's in two days.

25:18.372 --> 25:20.339
Well, maybe we
could call down...

25:20.341 --> 25:21.773
It's too late!

25:29.416 --> 25:30.515
Ann, listen...

25:30.517 --> 25:32.784
Don't, don't. Don't.

25:34.587 --> 25:36.121
This is not fixable.

25:46.599 --> 25:49.301
Just go, Matt.

25:49.303 --> 25:51.236
Just go.

26:06.552 --> 26:09.855
What the hell did Alex pick up
from your place the other day?

26:09.857 --> 26:11.490
I don't know.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.928
Well, over for sure now, huh?

26:16.930 --> 26:20.099
She left something so she'd
have a chance to come see you,

26:20.101 --> 26:22.534
see if she still had feelings.

26:22.536 --> 26:27.373
Based on what I saw, she didn't
have any feelings... except anger.

26:27.375 --> 26:30.175
Think you've had enough.

26:30.177 --> 26:32.011
I'm trying to help you here.

26:32.013 --> 26:34.380
One of your patrons
has been overserved.

26:34.382 --> 26:36.248
I may have to cite you
on that, Helena.

26:36.250 --> 26:40.519
See you tomorrow, Chae.
See you tomorrow.

26:42.122 --> 26:46.025
Man. Bustin' my chops,
Mr. Drinking-on-duty.

26:52.265 --> 26:53.916
I'll see you later.

26:53.918 --> 26:55.734
Good night.
Take it easy.

26:58.271 --> 27:00.139
Let me get you
a refill, chief.

27:00.141 --> 27:02.807
No, I'm good, Chris.

27:02.809 --> 27:04.843
It ain't a bribe,
just a beer.

27:04.845 --> 27:07.312
Two, whatever
he was just drinking.

27:13.386 --> 27:14.453
Thank you.

27:17.557 --> 27:20.125
Let me ask you something.

27:20.127 --> 27:23.162
That night you were out there
looking for that prowler,

27:23.164 --> 27:26.798
did you see anybody?
No, I didn't.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.702
'Cause I had this feeling
when I got home that...

27:30.704 --> 27:34.339
Ann was with
some other guy.

27:34.341 --> 27:35.740
Really?

27:35.742 --> 27:38.877
I think he snuck out the back
when I got home.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.517
No, I didn't--
I didn't see anybody.

27:53.626 --> 27:55.260
I'll tell you what,
though.

27:55.262 --> 27:58.197
Next time that little
pussy comes around...

27:58.199 --> 27:59.798
Little pussy?

27:59.800 --> 28:01.933
Sure. The guy scurries
out the back door

28:01.935 --> 28:03.635
the second
he hears my voice.

28:03.637 --> 28:04.636
"Scurries?"

28:04.638 --> 28:05.770
Yeah.

28:07.108 --> 28:11.710
You know, I could
almost respect a man

28:11.712 --> 28:13.712
who had the balls
to confront me,

28:13.714 --> 28:17.082
tell me, "yeah,
I'm banging your wife."

28:19.185 --> 28:21.220
Maybe this--this--
this guy,

28:21.222 --> 28:23.489
maybe there's nothing
he would rather do

28:23.491 --> 28:25.557
than, you know,
to tell you

28:25.559 --> 28:28.827
that you're a lousy husband
and you don't deserve Ann.

28:28.829 --> 28:31.062
Maybe there's nothing
he would rather do

28:31.064 --> 28:34.065
than to walk up into your face,
look you in the eye,

28:34.067 --> 28:39.138
and say to you, "Chris,
I'm banging your wife...

28:39.140 --> 28:41.373
Good."

28:41.375 --> 28:43.875
Maybe. You know, maybe...

28:43.877 --> 28:46.044
Maybe your wife won't let him.

28:48.581 --> 28:51.750
I'd respect him at least.

28:51.752 --> 28:54.753
And if he did that,
then I'd go up to him,

28:54.755 --> 28:56.588
look him in his eye,
and I'd say,

28:56.590 --> 29:00.425
"just come near her again...

29:00.427 --> 29:02.594
And I'll kill you."

29:02.596 --> 29:05.264
Oh, Chris. Wow.

29:07.033 --> 29:09.868
You're talking to the wrong guy,
because, as a police officer,

29:09.870 --> 29:12.704
I can't let you go around
threatening people's lives.

29:12.706 --> 29:14.072
If you're serious,

29:14.074 --> 29:16.441
then I'd be obligated
to do something about it.

29:16.443 --> 29:17.442
Really?

29:17.444 --> 29:19.911
That's right.

29:19.913 --> 29:23.415
Thanks for the beer...
And the conversation.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.083
Thanks for listening.

29:25.085 --> 29:29.154
You give Ann my best...
If you can.

29:55.915 --> 29:57.549
You been waiting long?

29:57.551 --> 29:58.783
Hi.

29:58.785 --> 30:01.486
Sorry about last night.

30:01.488 --> 30:02.854
Okay.

30:05.425 --> 30:07.693
You must really
be mad at me.

30:16.269 --> 30:20.339
God, I used to love
coming out here with you.

30:20.341 --> 30:21.840
I thought I was the shit,

30:21.842 --> 30:23.908
being a freshman
making out with a senior.

30:23.910 --> 30:25.944
You were.

30:25.946 --> 30:27.512
Still are.

30:27.514 --> 30:29.248
I guess I was, huh?

30:37.290 --> 30:38.523
Here.

30:38.525 --> 30:39.791
What's this?

30:39.793 --> 30:41.760
My going-away present.

30:41.762 --> 30:42.761
Going away?

30:42.763 --> 30:44.028
Insurance policy.

30:47.734 --> 30:49.934
Making me
the beneficiary?

30:49.936 --> 30:51.803
Come on, Ann.
Yes, you can.

30:51.805 --> 30:52.837
Buy that fishing boat

30:52.839 --> 30:54.973
you and Chae
have always talked about.

30:54.975 --> 30:56.308
Right.

30:56.310 --> 30:57.809
Here.

30:57.811 --> 30:59.778
No. I'm leaving tomorrow.

30:59.780 --> 31:00.779
What?

31:00.781 --> 31:02.180
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

31:02.182 --> 31:03.715
And, um...

31:03.717 --> 31:06.351
I've got to
get out of here.

31:06.353 --> 31:08.219
I need to get away
from Chris.

31:08.221 --> 31:09.621
I need some peace.

31:36.816 --> 31:38.082
Chief Whitlock.

31:38.084 --> 31:39.384
How can I help you?

31:39.386 --> 31:40.919
You just did, buddy.

32:25.431 --> 32:26.698
How you doing?

32:26.700 --> 32:27.733
Good.

32:28.769 --> 32:31.069
Take this.
Meet me at my house.

32:31.071 --> 32:33.104
What is it?

32:33.106 --> 32:35.106
It's a gift to you.

32:35.108 --> 32:37.743
Switzerland.
What?

32:37.745 --> 32:38.910
It's money.

32:38.912 --> 32:40.078
What money?

32:41.914 --> 32:44.048
That drug money?

32:45.150 --> 32:47.218
Matt, no, no.

32:47.220 --> 32:49.788
Oh, my God.

32:49.790 --> 32:51.556
What if they want it back?

32:51.558 --> 32:53.592
By law, the money
has to stay in the custody

32:53.594 --> 32:56.762
of the arresting department until
the appeals process is over.

32:56.764 --> 32:59.097
With the money Scarcetti has,
it could take years.

32:59.099 --> 33:00.565
But Tony and the guys--

33:00.567 --> 33:03.067
they think I'm putting it
in a safe deposit box.

33:03.069 --> 33:05.737
What time does
Chris get home?

33:05.739 --> 33:07.639
Uh...11:30.

33:07.641 --> 33:09.574
Go to your house, pack a bag,

33:09.576 --> 33:12.611
meet me at my house, 11:00.

33:12.613 --> 33:15.179
You okay?
Uh-huh.

33:15.181 --> 33:17.048
See you later.

33:34.834 --> 33:36.234
Ann?

33:40.606 --> 33:43.141
Oh, hey...

33:43.143 --> 33:45.076
What are you doing here?

33:45.078 --> 33:46.978
Barbara's pissed off
about something.

33:46.980 --> 33:48.980
Got to wait her out.

33:50.850 --> 33:53.284
Listen, listen.

33:53.286 --> 33:55.620
You see anybody
come in here?

33:55.622 --> 33:56.922
No.
You sure?

33:58.658 --> 34:01.326
Okay. Why don't you
head over to the Scuttlebutt?

34:01.328 --> 34:03.227
They cut me off,
no thanks to you.

34:03.229 --> 34:05.564
Just tell them chief Whitlock
said everything's okay.

34:05.566 --> 34:07.466
That's the first place
Barbara's going to look!

34:07.468 --> 34:09.568
She won't look there.
Yes, she will!

34:09.570 --> 34:11.703
I've got half a pack
of cigarettes in there!

36:08.054 --> 36:10.789
Lieutenant, tell engine two
to lay it out

36:10.791 --> 36:12.924
and start attacking it
from the back!

36:12.926 --> 36:13.992
Go, go!

36:17.980 --> 36:19.698
Pull it up!
Let's get moving!

36:19.700 --> 36:23.568
<i>1919 on 415 San Juan.</i>

36:23.570 --> 36:26.605
<i>That's about four Miles</i>
<i>outside of town.</i>

36:27.740 --> 36:31.743
Go! Go! Let's keep moving!
Aim the hose right there!

36:39.952 --> 36:42.420
Yeah, I got that covered.

36:43.723 --> 36:46.257
<i>318,</i>
<i>proceed to Sector Seven.</i>

36:48.628 --> 36:52.897
<i>825, say again.</i>
Mathias, you all right?

36:54.100 --> 36:55.967
I know it's hard to take.

36:57.103 --> 36:59.203
I'll grab you
a cup of coffee.

37:10.215 --> 37:11.549
Was it an accident?

37:11.551 --> 37:13.384
I don't know. Maybe.

37:13.386 --> 37:17.522
These propane tanks
just don't blow for no reason.

37:19.058 --> 37:21.893
Man, this place
was an inferno.

37:21.895 --> 37:24.462
Those poor folks
didn't have a chance.

37:39.945 --> 37:41.112
Hi, chief.

37:46.218 --> 37:47.218
Chief.

37:50.455 --> 37:52.173
What are you doing here?

37:52.175 --> 37:55.927
I'm a homicide detective,
and there's two dead bodies.

37:55.929 --> 37:59.263
So what happened?
They think the propane tank blew.

37:59.265 --> 38:02.901
You know who they are?
I think it's definitely "were."

38:02.903 --> 38:04.035
Right, Chae.

38:04.037 --> 38:07.371
Hey, Mathias, check it out.

38:07.373 --> 38:08.973
Definitely arson.

38:11.243 --> 38:14.979
It's definitely arson.
Definitely.

38:14.981 --> 38:18.449
I'm thinking the closer I stay
to the scene, the better.

38:18.451 --> 38:20.551
Yeah, it's possibly
a double homicide.

38:20.553 --> 38:23.254
We're gonna have to
take this thing over.

38:25.557 --> 38:26.758
Chief?
Yeah.

38:26.760 --> 38:30.394
Chief, Judy Anderson's mom
is visiting from Orlando.

38:30.396 --> 38:33.798
Last night, Judy said her mom
saw somebody sneaking around.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.800
I checked it out,
I didn't see anything.

38:35.802 --> 38:37.736
We should probably tell Alex.

38:37.738 --> 38:39.971
I'll tell her.
You get back to the office.

38:39.973 --> 38:42.073
Hey, chief, they want me
to run my investigation

38:42.075 --> 38:44.075
out of your place
for the next 24.

38:44.077 --> 38:45.744
I'm going to
need your help--

38:45.746 --> 38:47.746
background on the vics,
people they knew.

38:47.748 --> 38:49.948
A tour guide?
Pretty much. You cool with that?

38:49.950 --> 38:51.282
Okay. No problem.
Are you sure?

38:51.284 --> 38:52.984
No problem at all.

38:52.986 --> 38:56.221
Why don't we ride back and you
fill me in on the Harrisons?

38:56.223 --> 38:58.056
My boys will set up
at your place.

38:58.058 --> 38:59.257
Okay.
Great.

39:09.268 --> 39:13.371
I just wanted to say I'm
really sorry about the timing.

39:13.373 --> 39:14.873
What do you mean?

39:14.875 --> 39:17.942
With the papers,
and then this today.

39:17.944 --> 39:19.277
The divorce papers?

39:19.279 --> 39:20.912
I should have
called you before.

39:20.914 --> 39:23.047
That would have been nice.

39:23.049 --> 39:25.183
I know.

39:25.185 --> 39:27.185
But it has been eight months.

39:27.187 --> 39:29.520
Don't you think
we need some closure?

39:29.522 --> 39:31.856
I really don't want
to talk about it.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.695
Thanks for opening up.

39:39.899 --> 39:42.233
So let's talk
about the Harrisons, then.

39:42.235 --> 39:44.402
Either of them
screwing around on the side?

39:44.404 --> 39:47.138
I don't know. Is anybody
happily married these days?

39:50.242 --> 39:52.177
These have already
been gone through.

39:52.179 --> 39:55.613
Right. He was supposed
to get off at 11:30.

39:57.082 --> 39:59.483
Right. Mr. Harrison.

39:59.485 --> 40:02.720
So you don't know if Mr. Harrison
even came to work or not.

40:02.722 --> 40:04.222
Hold on one second.

40:04.224 --> 40:07.225
Did you know she worked as a
dental hygienist for a Dr. Shider?

40:07.227 --> 40:08.927
Really? No.

40:08.929 --> 40:12.077
I'm going to pay him a visit.
You want to come?

40:12.103 --> 40:12.889
Okay.

40:14.266 --> 40:16.034
Okay. Thanks.

40:16.036 --> 40:18.102
So she quit yesterday?

40:18.104 --> 40:21.840
Well, kind of.
Ann Merai had terminal cancer.

40:21.842 --> 40:23.774
Really?

40:23.776 --> 40:26.344
I think she was trying
to keep it quiet.

40:26.346 --> 40:28.663
Anything else
you could tell us?

40:28.665 --> 40:32.450
I think she was
having an affair.

40:32.452 --> 40:36.638
Did she actually tell you
she was having an affair?

40:36.640 --> 40:38.289
We don't really talk a lot,

40:38.291 --> 40:40.424
mainly what's happening
on our stories

40:40.426 --> 40:41.926
and stuff like that,

40:41.928 --> 40:44.462
but I just got the feeling.

40:44.464 --> 40:47.298
Like, sometimes when
she'd be on the phone,

40:47.300 --> 40:49.901
she would talk real quiet.

40:49.903 --> 40:51.069
Whisper?

40:52.872 --> 40:54.772
Did you ever see him,

40:54.774 --> 40:57.208
or did she ever
tell you who he was?

40:59.211 --> 41:02.080
No, no.
But--but he was classy.

41:02.082 --> 41:06.484
About a week ago, she got this big
thing of flowers from Rosie's.

41:06.486 --> 41:08.586
Really nice.
It was beautiful.

41:08.588 --> 41:10.054
Remember, Bruce?

41:10.056 --> 41:12.423
But I met her husband once,

41:12.425 --> 41:16.060
and he just doesn't seem
like the type to send flowers.

41:16.062 --> 41:17.528
Right.

41:19.265 --> 41:22.600
Rosie! Chief Whitlock.

41:22.602 --> 41:26.104
Listen, we're trying to find out
if some flowers were sent

41:26.106 --> 41:31.075
to an Ann Merai Harrison
last week, sent to her office.

41:31.077 --> 41:34.245
Harrison. Check and see
if one of your guys sent them.

41:34.247 --> 41:35.280
<i>What hospital?</i>

41:35.282 --> 41:36.514
Mercy Med.

41:36.516 --> 41:37.515
Ah!

41:38.850 --> 41:41.019
Chris Harrison.
Her husband.

41:41.021 --> 41:42.954
Okay. Thanks a lot, Rosie.

41:42.956 --> 41:44.688
Yeah. No, that's all.

41:44.690 --> 41:46.624
Okay. Thank you, Rosie.

41:46.626 --> 41:48.592
<i>If you'd like to make a call...</i>

41:50.462 --> 41:52.096
You ready?

41:53.698 --> 41:55.266
I guess so.

41:55.268 --> 41:56.634
Okay. All right.

41:56.636 --> 41:57.969
Thank you for your help.

41:57.971 --> 41:59.603
Sure.
Thank you.

41:59.605 --> 42:04.208
If you think of anything else,
here's my card. Thanks a lot.

42:06.645 --> 42:09.914
Please don't do me like that.
You knew I wasn't finished.

42:09.916 --> 42:11.816
I'm sorry.

42:11.818 --> 42:14.518
Dr. Shider gave me the name
of Ann Merai's doctor.

42:14.520 --> 42:17.688
I want to find out more
about her cancer.

42:18.757 --> 42:21.225
You can drop me off
back at the station.

42:21.227 --> 42:24.028
You really don't like
being around me, do you?

42:24.030 --> 42:25.496
No, no. I just, you know...

42:25.498 --> 42:27.631
There isn't any reason
for both of us

42:27.633 --> 42:29.784
to be wasting time
at the doctor's office.

42:29.786 --> 42:31.569
What's so pressing
that you have to do?

42:31.571 --> 42:34.272
I do have a job.
I am chief of police.

42:34.274 --> 42:37.141
Yeah, of a four-person
department, Matt.

42:37.143 --> 42:39.510
See, that's the problem
between the two of us.

42:39.512 --> 42:42.080
You think your job
is more important than my job.

42:42.082 --> 42:44.082
Never said that.
Yeah, you did.

42:44.084 --> 42:47.585
You never say it directly,
but in indirect ways you say it.

42:47.587 --> 42:49.553
You wanted to leave
Banyan Key, go to Miami

42:49.555 --> 42:52.556
so we could be closer
to <i>your</i> important job.

42:52.558 --> 42:54.558
You never said the commute
was taking time away from us?

42:54.560 --> 42:56.527
I didn't have a problem with that.
You didn't?

42:56.529 --> 43:00.031
So I'm hearing things now?
Whatever.

43:00.033 --> 43:02.333
Is that the reason
you're not coming with me?

43:02.335 --> 43:04.402
Is that your date paging you?

43:04.404 --> 43:07.138
One of my four officers checked in.
It's a tracking device.

43:07.140 --> 43:08.906
And you can tell on that?

43:08.908 --> 43:12.627
That's what it tells me. GPS.
We're all tied in to it.

43:12.629 --> 43:14.144
The mayor's brother sells them,

43:14.146 --> 43:15.746
so we spent
half the budget on them.

43:15.748 --> 43:19.634
See, if we were moving,
you'd see it tracking.

43:19.636 --> 43:21.185
Sorry.

43:21.187 --> 43:23.921
If we were moving right now,
it would show us tracking.

43:23.923 --> 43:25.189
Great.

43:25.191 --> 43:27.058
Why don't we drive
to the doctor's office,

43:27.060 --> 43:29.160
and I can see how it works?

43:31.897 --> 43:33.464
Okay.
Okay.

43:36.201 --> 43:37.735
Thank you.

43:55.387 --> 43:58.822
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll meet you in there.

43:58.824 --> 44:00.691
Hi.
May I help you?

44:00.693 --> 44:02.793
Yeah. Dr. Donovan's office.

44:02.795 --> 44:04.929
Her office
is on the third floor.

44:04.931 --> 44:06.764
Thank you, Ramona.

44:09.134 --> 44:11.402
Ann Harrison
didn't have cancer.

44:12.471 --> 44:14.388
Are you sure?

44:14.390 --> 44:16.474
Not counting the time
she spent in Atlanta,

44:16.476 --> 44:18.909
Ann Merai has been my patient
since Junior high school.

44:18.911 --> 44:21.412
If she had cancer,
I would have known.

44:22.281 --> 44:23.847
I don't get it.

44:24.916 --> 44:27.401
Maybe she saw
another doctor.

44:27.403 --> 44:29.253
She was here for her yearly

44:29.255 --> 44:31.822
when she first got back to town
two months ago,

44:31.824 --> 44:34.058
and she was healthy
as a proverbial horse.

44:35.660 --> 44:39.263
I'm looking it
over here, and...

44:39.265 --> 44:41.932
I don't understand.
Who told you she had cancer?

44:41.934 --> 44:43.033
Excuse me.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.073
So...

45:21.740 --> 45:23.574
Can I help you?

45:25.177 --> 45:28.379
Yeah, I'm looking
for Dr. Frieland.

45:28.381 --> 45:30.498
You're looking at him.

45:31.483 --> 45:33.467
You're Dr. Frieland?

45:33.469 --> 45:36.354
Yes, I am.

45:36.356 --> 45:37.388
Hold on, pop.

45:37.390 --> 45:40.057
You're sure?
This is your office?

45:40.059 --> 45:43.093
It has been
for ten years, yes.

45:43.095 --> 45:44.862
Look, I'll get back to you.

45:44.864 --> 45:47.765
Do you have a patient named
Ann Merai Harrison?

45:47.767 --> 45:49.833
I really can't
tell you that.

45:49.835 --> 45:52.703
You can tell me.
Was she your patient or not?

45:52.705 --> 45:54.572
Was she
your patient or not?

45:54.574 --> 45:55.873
You don't understand--

45:56.941 --> 45:58.842
was she
your patient or not?

46:00.078 --> 46:02.446
No, I've never had
a patient by that name.

46:02.448 --> 46:05.383
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure, very sure.

46:05.385 --> 46:07.685
Yeah, I would know that.

46:07.687 --> 46:09.019
Okay, I'm sorry.

46:12.023 --> 46:14.425
That your pen?

46:14.427 --> 46:16.627
Pen? Yes.

46:16.629 --> 46:18.929
Do you use it much?

46:18.931 --> 46:20.565
No, not very much.

46:20.567 --> 46:22.733
You don't mind
if I take it, do you?

46:22.735 --> 46:26.671
No, you can have the pen.
Sure. It's yours.

46:28.307 --> 46:30.941
Take it. It's yours.

46:45.424 --> 46:46.624
Right.

46:47.859 --> 46:49.493
Right.

46:49.495 --> 46:52.162
I know that part.
Hang on one sec.

46:54.433 --> 46:56.434
Did you get a checkup
or something?

46:56.436 --> 46:58.369
No, just bad coffee.

46:59.438 --> 47:01.672
All right.

47:01.674 --> 47:04.275
No, just tell them they've
got to stop lagging.

47:04.277 --> 47:06.277
We need
those phone records now.

47:06.279 --> 47:08.011
All right. Thanks.

47:10.382 --> 47:13.183
You all right?
Yeah.

47:13.185 --> 47:16.053
We all good? Fantastic.

47:30.902 --> 47:32.403
How's this, ma'am?

47:32.405 --> 47:35.072
You fixed his nose already?
Just wonderful.

47:35.074 --> 47:36.507
Hey, chief.

47:38.042 --> 47:40.411
Hey.

47:40.413 --> 47:42.045
How you doing, Judy?

47:42.047 --> 47:44.415
I'm fine, thanks,
considering...

47:44.417 --> 47:47.285
Alex, we've got
an eyewitness here.

47:47.287 --> 47:50.954
Mr. Anderson, this is
detective Diaz-Whitlock.

47:50.956 --> 47:54.625
Well, just...
We're on top of it.

47:54.627 --> 47:56.727
Chief, I told them how
Judy's ma saw somebody

47:56.729 --> 47:59.062
sneaking around the
Harrison place last night.

47:59.064 --> 48:01.532
Got them right over there
sketching it out for us.

48:01.534 --> 48:03.467
...the guy she saw
outside her window...

48:03.469 --> 48:07.354
That's her right there?
Okay, all right. Good job, T.

48:07.356 --> 48:10.040
Chief,
check this out.

48:10.042 --> 48:12.976
Sketch of a prowler out to
the Harrison's last night.

48:12.978 --> 48:14.512
Yeah.

48:14.514 --> 48:15.979
Ring any bells?

48:15.981 --> 48:16.847
Hi, Tony.

48:18.684 --> 48:21.652
No. I mean, no.

48:22.887 --> 48:24.588
He looked like him.

48:25.857 --> 48:27.792
Like who?
Like him.

48:29.227 --> 48:30.528
Like me?

48:30.530 --> 48:31.962
Yeah, yeah. You.

48:36.935 --> 48:39.837
Mom, he's the chief of police.

48:39.839 --> 48:43.073
So he was black, ma'am?
Yeah, he was black.

48:43.075 --> 48:45.643
Wait a minute.
Maybe...

48:45.645 --> 48:46.844
Maybe him.

48:46.846 --> 48:51.114
Mrs. Anderson, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

48:52.334 --> 48:53.784
Anyway...

48:53.786 --> 48:55.786
I'm so sorry.

48:55.788 --> 48:57.988
Mother was raised
in a different time.

48:57.990 --> 49:01.225
Don't worry about it.
We're on top of it, okay?

49:01.227 --> 49:03.077
I need to talk to you.

49:03.079 --> 49:04.462
I appreciate you
coming down.

49:04.464 --> 49:06.263
I am so embarrassed.

49:08.032 --> 49:10.368
Please, you've got to stop.

49:10.370 --> 49:13.937
I want you to take this
up to Miami for me, okay?

49:13.939 --> 49:17.040
I want you to give it
to a detective Gissen.

49:17.042 --> 49:18.709
Gissen?
Gissen, right.

49:18.711 --> 49:20.745
I'm going to give you
his phone number.

49:20.747 --> 49:22.747
Tell him
I need prints on that asap.

49:22.749 --> 49:24.248
Is it for this thing?

49:24.250 --> 49:25.249
Yeah.

49:25.251 --> 49:27.951
<i>Excuse me, chief.</i>
Yeah.

49:27.953 --> 49:30.771
<i>An agent Stark from the DEA</i>
<i>is on line one for you.</i>

49:30.773 --> 49:32.055
Who?

49:32.057 --> 49:34.725
<i>Agent Stark. Said it's about</i>
<i>the Scarcetti case.</i>

49:40.732 --> 49:42.266
Thank you.

49:42.268 --> 49:43.834
Yeah.

49:46.070 --> 49:47.137
Chief Whitlock.

49:47.139 --> 49:49.640
<i>Agent Stark, DEA.</i>
<i>How you doing?</i>

49:49.642 --> 49:52.075
Busy.
<i>You and me both, pal.</i>

49:52.077 --> 49:55.178
<i>I understand you guys are holding
the evidence in the Scarcetti case.</i>

49:55.180 --> 49:56.346
Uh-huh.

49:56.348 --> 50:00.418
<i>Great. That makes you</i>
<i>my new best friend.</i>

50:00.420 --> 50:02.753
<i>I'm going to send a couple
agents this afternoon</i>

50:02.755 --> 50:04.154
<i>to pick up that cash.</i>

50:04.156 --> 50:06.290
<i>We think</i>
<i>it was used last year</i>

50:06.292 --> 50:08.459
<i>in a sting operation</i>
<i>with Paolo Estaban.</i>

50:08.461 --> 50:11.395
If we can tie the serial numbers
to the bills you guys have,

50:11.397 --> 50:12.963
we can tie Estaban to Scarcetti.

50:12.965 --> 50:15.165
<i>This is of top priority</i>
<i>for us, chief.</i>

50:15.167 --> 50:17.802
<i>With this evidence, we can kill</i>
<i>two birds with one stone,</i>

50:17.804 --> 50:19.437
<i>nail Estaban and Scarcetti.</i>

50:19.439 --> 50:23.441
Why don't I call you tomorrow,
and we figure out a time--

50:23.443 --> 50:25.943
<i>whoa! This had to be done</i>
<i>the day before yesterday.</i>

50:25.945 --> 50:27.611
<i>We got a court date</i>
<i>next week.</i>

50:27.613 --> 50:29.680
The evidence has to stay
in my possession

50:29.682 --> 50:31.281
until the appeals
process is over.

50:31.283 --> 50:33.851
<i>I didn't call you to get a lecture
on the rules of evidence.</i>

50:33.853 --> 50:35.385
We, i.e..,
the United States government,

50:35.387 --> 50:38.556
need to check
the serial numbers on that cash.

50:38.558 --> 50:40.958
<i>When I hang up on you</i>
<i>in ten seconds,</i>

50:40.960 --> 50:43.794
<i>I want you to type up</i>
<i>a chain of evidence receipt.</i>

50:43.796 --> 50:47.397
<i>One of my men will be happy</i>
<i>to sign it for you.</i>

50:47.399 --> 50:50.033
Oh, yeah, and, chief...
Yeah?

50:50.035 --> 50:51.368
It's been ten seconds.

50:59.143 --> 51:00.911
Chief, you okay?

51:00.913 --> 51:02.580
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

51:02.582 --> 51:08.185
Just tell Gissen that I need
those prints really quick.

51:08.187 --> 51:10.220
I'm sure Alex can--

51:10.222 --> 51:12.189
we don't want
to give them to Alex.

51:12.191 --> 51:13.557
Sorry. I just thought--

51:13.559 --> 51:14.758
just do it!

51:16.528 --> 51:19.663
All right. Okay.

51:19.665 --> 51:21.932
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.

51:21.934 --> 51:23.467
Just--just go there,
stay there,

51:23.469 --> 51:26.003
and call me as soon
as they're done.

51:26.005 --> 51:27.270
You got it.

51:37.649 --> 51:42.019
No, I've been on hold.
When should I call back?

51:42.021 --> 51:43.286
Okay. Thanks.

51:47.125 --> 51:48.559
Here you go.

51:53.965 --> 51:55.365
BastÃ©, my phone records!

51:55.367 --> 51:58.368
How long can it take to fax over
a few sheets of paper?

51:58.370 --> 52:00.303
I'll call them again.

52:00.305 --> 52:03.306
Alex, I think
we've got something here.

52:03.308 --> 52:05.326
What?

52:05.328 --> 52:07.845
Look at this entry into the
checkbook, that last one.

52:09.748 --> 52:11.415
Is this the only
entry you found?

52:11.417 --> 52:13.083
So far,
but it's a new register.

52:13.085 --> 52:15.085
What's going on?

52:15.087 --> 52:16.921
Hey. Looks like they got
a life insurance policy,

52:16.923 --> 52:19.256
and we've got
a potential murder.

52:19.258 --> 52:23.761
There's got to be tons of these
life insurance companies, right?

52:23.763 --> 52:25.162
Right.

52:25.164 --> 52:27.264
You got any pull at the bank?
Sure.

52:27.266 --> 52:30.300
You want me to get an address?
Please.

52:32.604 --> 52:35.539
Hey, Sharlene, you know
that report I gave you?

52:51.322 --> 52:53.757
They're not going to
be able to run them

52:53.759 --> 52:55.192
for another half an hour.

52:55.194 --> 52:57.194
<i>Call me when</i>
<i>you've got something.</i>

52:57.196 --> 53:00.130
<i>T.</i>
Shit.

53:00.132 --> 53:02.199
You should see the rack

53:02.201 --> 53:04.401
<i>on this chick</i>
<i>that just walked by.</i>

53:04.403 --> 53:05.636
Just call me, T.

53:16.180 --> 53:19.083
Those my phone records?
No, just a fax for me.

53:19.085 --> 53:21.986
BastÃ©, what's up with my fax?
It's not here.

53:21.988 --> 53:24.287
She said she sent them.
Who's "she"?

53:24.289 --> 53:26.156
Miss white.
Who's Miss white?

53:26.158 --> 53:29.443
She's a supervisor over there.
I've dealt with her before.

53:29.445 --> 53:31.061
Call Miss white back,
'cause they're not here.

53:31.063 --> 53:33.563
I talked to her
a couple of minutes ago.

53:33.565 --> 53:34.698
Detective...

53:34.700 --> 53:38.002
Well, she assured me
that she sent them.

53:38.004 --> 53:41.038
We need to call her back
and actually have her wait

53:41.040 --> 53:44.008
as we see the fax
coming through.

53:44.010 --> 53:46.409
Sure, boss. Be happy to.

53:54.352 --> 53:56.437
Miss white?

53:56.439 --> 53:58.255
This is detective BastÃ©
with Miami-Dade.

53:58.257 --> 54:01.825
Yeah, I just spoke to you about
the Harrison phone records.

54:01.827 --> 54:04.011
I haven't received them yet.

54:04.013 --> 54:06.263
What do you mean
you sent them?

54:06.265 --> 54:09.066
I'm staring at the fax machine,
and it's not there.

54:09.068 --> 54:11.334
I'm going to stand
right in front of it,

54:11.336 --> 54:14.004
and if I don't hear
the phone ring in 30 seconds,

54:14.006 --> 54:15.739
I'm going to your superiors.

54:15.741 --> 54:17.941
Do I need to be
more clear than that?

54:17.943 --> 54:21.011
Can I use your computer?
Couple of minutes.

54:21.013 --> 54:23.814
They just e-mailed me a bunch
of warrants I need to look up.

54:23.816 --> 54:25.482
60 seconds.
Chief--

54:25.484 --> 54:27.450
I'm not raising
my voice!

54:39.931 --> 54:42.666
You got writer's block.

54:42.668 --> 54:44.835
No, just working
on my report.

54:44.837 --> 54:47.705
On what?
On somebody jaywalking?

54:47.707 --> 54:50.373
Yeah, someone was jaywalking
or urinating on the sidewalk

54:50.375 --> 54:52.375
or throwing spitballs
at a crossing guard.

54:52.377 --> 54:54.644
I know it's a small office,
but it's my office.

54:55.915 --> 54:57.431
Phone records
coming in. Alex!

55:01.169 --> 55:02.252
Is this it?

55:02.254 --> 55:03.320
It says "receiving."

55:09.828 --> 55:11.512
Oh, shit.
It's out of paper.

55:11.514 --> 55:13.897
You're kidding me.
Oh, God.

55:13.899 --> 55:15.833
Could we get
some paper, Sharlene?

55:15.835 --> 55:18.435
Anybody got any paper?
Paper, folks!

55:18.437 --> 55:19.970
Don't all move at once.

55:19.972 --> 55:22.405
Anybody in Banyan Key
have any paper?

55:22.407 --> 55:24.641
It's about 8 1/2 by 11 inches.
Little rectangle.

55:24.643 --> 55:26.376
Here you go.

55:45.096 --> 55:47.164
What do you do? "Start"?

55:49.267 --> 55:50.333
Here it comes.

55:53.171 --> 55:57.274
We've got a little problem
with this machine.

55:57.276 --> 55:59.609
It's fine, fine.

55:59.611 --> 56:01.278
Great. Thank you.

56:01.280 --> 56:03.213
Let me just get over here.

56:05.950 --> 56:08.051
I hate this thing.

56:09.921 --> 56:11.889
Here.

56:11.891 --> 56:14.575
There we go. "Start."

56:14.577 --> 56:16.459
Hah! There we go.

56:20.832 --> 56:23.200
I can't read this.
It's the toner.

56:23.202 --> 56:25.836
Have her re-fax it.
It's okay.

56:25.838 --> 56:28.939
I can read it. It's okay.
No, fax it again.

56:28.941 --> 56:30.908
That says Barry Thomas.

56:30.910 --> 56:33.576
A friend of Chris' from high school.
I know him.

56:33.578 --> 56:36.880
That one is Will Blount.
You guys okay?

56:36.882 --> 56:38.148
It's okay.

56:38.150 --> 56:40.017
This one is Frank Rhodes.

56:40.019 --> 56:41.218
Frank Rhodes.

56:42.369 --> 56:45.204
No. All the boxes
go to Miami.

56:45.206 --> 56:48.507
So the last call they made was
to American airlines at 8 P.M.

56:48.509 --> 56:50.709
Hey. Got a surprise for you.

56:50.711 --> 56:52.278
Both of them already dead

56:52.280 --> 56:53.880
when somebody
turned them into s'mores.

56:53.882 --> 56:55.714
What?
Both of them?

56:55.716 --> 56:57.716
No sign of smoke
in their lungs.

56:57.718 --> 57:00.386
Come on. If they'd been alive
when that place went up,

57:00.388 --> 57:02.488
their lungs
would look like mine.

57:03.556 --> 57:05.892
Alex, here are
the cell phone records.

57:05.894 --> 57:07.093
Cell phone?

57:07.095 --> 57:09.795
They're on a different database
than the land lines.

57:09.797 --> 57:12.631
"Town of Banyan Key."

57:12.633 --> 57:15.167
"12:34 A.M."

57:15.169 --> 57:19.005
305-555-0199?

57:20.740 --> 57:23.609
What time did grandma say
she saw that prowler?

57:23.611 --> 57:24.944
After <i>Leno.</i>

57:24.946 --> 57:28.047
What time's <i>Leno</i> over?
Like 12:00, 12:30?

57:28.049 --> 57:29.115
Hello?

57:29.117 --> 57:31.250
This might be our guy.

57:31.252 --> 57:33.419
How many phone calls
do you get after midnight?

57:33.421 --> 57:35.087
Must be a bad connection.

57:35.089 --> 57:38.925
All right.
555-0199.

57:40.693 --> 57:42.628
Come on, come on.

57:52.639 --> 57:55.007
Yeah. Okay.

57:55.009 --> 57:57.810
Let me see if I can find
the number for you.

58:00.780 --> 58:03.182
I don't know who it is.

58:03.184 --> 58:05.551
<i>The Nextel subscriber
you are trying to reach</i>

58:05.553 --> 58:09.055
<i>is outside the service area.</i>
<i>Please try again later.</i>

58:09.057 --> 58:11.708
No, I don't have it.

58:11.710 --> 58:13.993
Whoever it is works
for the town of Banyan Key.

58:13.995 --> 58:16.228
How do we find out
whose phone this is?

58:16.230 --> 58:19.165
- All right, I'll...
- Just ask.

58:19.167 --> 58:21.100
Is there anybody
even in Banyan Key?

58:22.202 --> 58:24.370
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

58:27.574 --> 58:29.342
Hey, Alex?

58:29.344 --> 58:31.110
I'm sorry,

58:31.112 --> 58:33.612
I was drifting off there.
What'd you say that number was?

58:33.614 --> 58:35.481
555-0199.

58:35.483 --> 58:38.317
0199?

58:38.319 --> 58:40.052
You're sure it's not 1099?

58:40.054 --> 58:42.054
Chae, 0199.

58:42.056 --> 58:46.025
0199? That's weird.
That's my cell phone number.

58:46.027 --> 58:47.777
Yours?

58:47.779 --> 58:49.695
Yeah.
Aren't you county?

58:49.697 --> 58:53.565
I work part-time as a paramedic--
football games, school stuff.

58:53.567 --> 58:55.401
And you called him
last night?

58:55.403 --> 58:58.704
I don't know.
Did I...

58:58.706 --> 59:02.575
Oh, Jesus, I did
call him last night.

59:02.577 --> 59:04.043
I called him from the bar.

59:04.045 --> 59:07.213
I wanted to see if he wanted
to have a couple of drinks.

59:07.215 --> 59:10.082
You're friends with him?
I wouldn't say that.

59:10.084 --> 59:13.052
He's, like,
my bottom-of-the-list guy

59:13.054 --> 59:15.654
when you've got to have
somebody to drink with.

59:15.656 --> 59:18.424
I would have mentioned it.
I totally forgot.

59:18.426 --> 59:21.593
You should have told me this
at the scene, Chae.

59:21.595 --> 59:24.563
I'm sorry. I don't remember
too much about last night.

59:24.565 --> 59:27.133
I had a fight with Barbara.
I was in no good shape.

59:27.135 --> 59:29.402
Check with the bartender.
I closed the place,

59:29.404 --> 59:31.504
staggered home,
passed out next to my wife.

59:31.506 --> 59:36.242
I didn't move until I got the
call to show up at the scene.

59:36.244 --> 59:38.244
I need a statement.

59:38.246 --> 59:41.514
I'll give you
a statement right now.

59:41.516 --> 59:43.349
What's the matter with you?

59:43.351 --> 59:46.885
You're like a love child
of Barney fife and Joe Friday.

59:46.887 --> 59:48.154
All right, a statement.

01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:05.438
What the hell was that about?
I was sleeping with her.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.705
Jesus.

01:00:06.707 --> 01:00:08.524
So you...

01:00:08.526 --> 01:00:11.310
No, but it was all a plan,
them coming back here.

01:00:11.312 --> 01:00:13.663
They set me up.
They planned the whole thing.

01:00:13.665 --> 01:00:15.647
What plan?
What do you mean?

01:00:16.616 --> 01:00:19.151
I gave her
the Scarcetti money.

01:00:19.153 --> 01:00:21.087
God!

01:00:21.089 --> 01:00:24.156
Would you have given it to me
if I slept with you?

01:00:28.562 --> 01:00:31.163
Any trace of the money?
None.

01:00:32.232 --> 01:00:34.300
I thought I had
trouble with women.

01:00:34.302 --> 01:00:36.235
Maybe you should
just tell her.

01:00:36.237 --> 01:00:37.736
Who, Alex?
Yeah. Tell Alex.

01:00:37.738 --> 01:00:41.240
Are you out of your mind?
Look what they got on me.

01:00:41.242 --> 01:00:43.842
Motive--Ann Merai names me
beneficiary on her insurance policy,

01:00:43.844 --> 01:00:45.844
and I was having
an affair with her.

01:00:45.846 --> 01:00:47.879
Opportunity--
an eyewitness saw me

01:00:47.881 --> 01:00:50.216
outside their house
the night it blew up.

01:00:50.218 --> 01:00:52.318
You want to hear some more?

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.385
Alibi.

01:00:53.387 --> 01:00:55.020
Home, by myself.

01:00:55.022 --> 01:00:57.956
That good? At least you changed
your cell phone number.

01:00:57.958 --> 01:00:59.958
Even if Alex
wanted to believe me,

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.627
there's so much evidence
against me,

01:01:01.629 --> 01:01:03.061
she'd have to turn me in.

01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:04.863
You're right.

01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:07.233
That'd kill any chance you had
of getting back together.

01:01:07.235 --> 01:01:08.467
What?

01:01:08.469 --> 01:01:11.003
She says, "let's call
the divorce off."

01:01:11.005 --> 01:01:15.040
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at murder charges.

01:01:15.042 --> 01:01:17.876
The gal's a peach. I don't
know what you were thinking.

01:01:17.878 --> 01:01:19.445
Never mind. Forget it.

01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:21.847
Can I do anything?

01:01:21.849 --> 01:01:24.183
You don't think obstruction
of justice is enough?

01:01:24.185 --> 01:01:26.185
I'm on a roll.

01:01:27.237 --> 01:01:28.654
Chief Whitlock.

01:01:28.656 --> 01:01:30.055
They matched the prints
on the pen.

01:01:30.057 --> 01:01:33.225
The guy's name is Paul Cabot.
He's done time before.

01:01:33.227 --> 01:01:35.394
They got his prints
from a criminal database.

01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:37.163
You got an address?

01:01:37.165 --> 01:01:41.400
<i>Yeah. 36 Reef Road,</i>
<i>in Kendall.</i>

01:02:09.196 --> 01:02:10.796
All right, come on.

01:02:12.131 --> 01:02:13.299
Hurry up.

01:02:26.313 --> 01:02:27.813
You want a beer?

01:02:27.815 --> 01:02:29.381
Nah, I'm okay.

01:03:02.482 --> 01:03:04.450
Ho ho ho.

01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:07.886
What tangled webs we weave...

01:03:07.888 --> 01:03:08.987
What you got?

01:03:08.989 --> 01:03:10.822
Your doctor
worked at the hospital,

01:03:10.824 --> 01:03:12.858
but seems he was
in my line of work.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.460
Son of a gun.

01:03:14.462 --> 01:03:16.161
Let's get out of here.

01:03:16.163 --> 01:03:18.530
Let me get the beer.
Chae, come on, let's go.

01:03:18.532 --> 01:03:20.366
Come on. I've got
to get the beer.

01:03:20.368 --> 01:03:23.736
A beer in the hand
is worth two in the fridge.

01:03:35.848 --> 01:03:37.015
What are you doing?

01:03:37.017 --> 01:03:40.886
Bottom of the ninth.
Down by a lot of runs.

01:03:40.888 --> 01:03:43.855
I got about
ten grand in the bank.

01:03:43.857 --> 01:03:47.826
Get you down to Costa Rica.
You can scout out boats for us.

01:03:47.828 --> 01:03:49.628
You think I'm done?

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:50.862
Mmm...

01:03:50.864 --> 01:03:53.582
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not running.

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:55.334
No. The idea
was I drive you.

01:03:55.336 --> 01:03:59.237
Yeah, you can drive me.
Drive me back to the station.

01:04:01.007 --> 01:04:02.541
All right.
All right.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.021
Got your insurance company
on the line.

01:04:16.023 --> 01:04:17.989
<i>That policy number</i>
<i>corresponds to</i>

01:04:17.991 --> 01:04:20.526
<i>a $1 million</i>
<i>term life insurance policy</i>

01:04:20.528 --> 01:04:22.194
<i>for an Ann Merai Harrison.</i>

01:04:22.196 --> 01:04:23.796
Any messages there for me?

01:04:24.864 --> 01:04:26.932
Who's the beneficiary?

01:04:26.934 --> 01:04:28.934
<i>Just a moment here.</i>

01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:34.440
<i>Let's see.</i>

01:04:34.442 --> 01:04:39.578
<i>Looks like the beneficiary</i>
<i>is listed as...</i>

01:04:42.732 --> 01:04:45.116
<i>Chris Harrison,</i>
<i>her husband.</i>

01:04:48.855 --> 01:04:51.156
All right, thank you.
You've been really helpful.

01:04:51.158 --> 01:04:54.159
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't be more--</i>
<i>wait a minute.</i>

01:04:54.161 --> 01:04:56.161
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>I got a note here.</i>

01:04:56.163 --> 01:05:00.065
<i>It seems the policy holder</i>
<i>requested a form</i>

01:05:00.067 --> 01:05:02.368
<i>to change the beneficiary</i>
<i>last week.</i>

01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.403
So she changed it?

01:05:04.405 --> 01:05:07.138
<i>Yeah, and if she did,</i>
<i>it's not in the system yet.</i>

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.875
So what does that mean?
Is that in the mail or...

01:05:09.877 --> 01:05:12.177
<i>It could be downstairs</i>
<i>in our processing center.</i>

01:05:12.179 --> 01:05:14.813
Waiting to be processed.
Can you connect me?

01:05:14.815 --> 01:05:16.849
<i>I think they're</i>
<i>still out to lunch.</i>

01:05:16.851 --> 01:05:19.585
All right, so call back
in half an hour?

01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:21.219
<i>Sure, why not?</i>

01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:22.454
Thank you.

01:05:27.326 --> 01:05:29.595
<i>This is Bill.</i>

01:05:29.597 --> 01:05:30.929
How you doing, Bill?

01:05:30.931 --> 01:05:34.032
<i>Good. What have you</i>
<i>been up to?</i>

01:05:34.034 --> 01:05:36.869
You got no idea.
Let me ask you a favor.

01:05:36.871 --> 01:05:39.872
I've got
a credit-card statement,

01:05:39.874 --> 01:05:41.807
capitol one
credit-card statement

01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:43.341
on a Paul Cabot.

01:05:43.343 --> 01:05:46.144
I need you to find out the
last place he used his card.

01:05:46.146 --> 01:05:47.479
I got something for you.

01:05:47.481 --> 01:05:48.980
<i>C-A-B-O-T?</i>
Yeah.

01:05:48.982 --> 01:05:50.783
<i>Can you hold?</i>
Yeah. No problem.

01:05:50.785 --> 01:05:53.452
I found this under the seat
of one of the Harrison's cars.

01:05:53.454 --> 01:05:55.487
It's a bank card receipt
to a gas station

01:05:55.489 --> 01:05:57.756
used by a guy named Paul Cabot.

01:05:57.758 --> 01:06:00.392
Nice.
Check the phone records.

01:06:00.394 --> 01:06:02.093
Already on it.
Paul Cabot.

01:06:02.095 --> 01:06:05.497
Anybody know or ever heard
of a Paul Cabot?

01:06:05.499 --> 01:06:08.133
Come on, people, wake up.

01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:10.436
Yes? No?

01:06:10.438 --> 01:06:11.470
No.

01:06:11.472 --> 01:06:12.971
Paul Cabot?

01:06:12.973 --> 01:06:15.541
Frank, call the bank,
see what they've got.

01:06:15.543 --> 01:06:18.677
No records of any incoming or
outgoing calls to a Paul Cabot.

01:06:18.679 --> 01:06:20.646
Check every restaurant,
gas station...

01:06:20.648 --> 01:06:22.147
<i>Matt?</i>

01:06:22.149 --> 01:06:24.349
Yeah, Bill?
<i>I've got something.</i>

01:06:24.351 --> 01:06:27.519
If this guy took a piss
and paid for it, I want to know.

01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:30.689
<i>He's got a reservation</i>
<i>at the Costa Coral Hotel.</i>

01:06:30.691 --> 01:06:32.390
There's a hold on it now?

01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:33.725
<i>He checked in yesterday.</i>

01:06:33.727 --> 01:06:35.861
Costa Coral hotel.
<i>You know where it is?</i>

01:06:35.863 --> 01:06:37.863
Yeah. On Atlantic Avenue.
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:37.865 --> 01:06:40.098
You're a lifesaver.

01:06:50.844 --> 01:06:52.444
Chief Whitlock?
Yeah.

01:06:52.446 --> 01:06:54.279
Agent white.
This is Agent Fetzer.

01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:56.482
We're here to pick up
the Scarcetti money.

01:06:56.484 --> 01:07:00.586
Agent Stark said to send
the money to his office.

01:07:00.588 --> 01:07:02.420
My guy left five minutes ago.

01:07:02.422 --> 01:07:05.591
He told you we'd pick it up.
He said send it to his office.

01:07:05.593 --> 01:07:07.893
He told you to send
the money to the office?

01:07:07.895 --> 01:07:09.160
He'll tell you.

01:07:09.162 --> 01:07:10.696
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

01:07:10.698 --> 01:07:12.230
He wants to talk to you.

01:07:12.232 --> 01:07:13.815
Hello.

01:07:13.817 --> 01:07:15.534
What the hell is your problem?

01:07:15.536 --> 01:07:17.369
I told you to get that
money ready,

01:07:17.371 --> 01:07:19.571
<i>that I was sending agents--</i>
you said--

01:07:19.573 --> 01:07:21.607
what are you, a parrot,
telling me what I said?

01:07:21.609 --> 01:07:23.008
I know what I said.

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:26.011
No, I'm not a parrot.
I know what you said.

01:07:26.013 --> 01:07:27.779
Then where the hell
is the money?

01:07:27.781 --> 01:07:30.165
If you shut up
for five minutes,

01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:32.050
I can tell you
where the money is.

01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:35.721
I sent the money to your office.
My guy just left.

01:07:35.723 --> 01:07:38.089
<i>He should be up there</i>
<i>in about an hour.</i>

01:07:38.091 --> 01:07:41.159
<i>If you have a problem with that</i>
<i>after I hang up in ten seconds,</i>

01:07:41.161 --> 01:07:43.529
call your partners at the IRS,
tell them to audit me.

01:07:43.531 --> 01:07:44.963
You little bastard!

01:07:44.965 --> 01:07:46.832
<i>Agent Stark,</i>
<i>Agent Stark.</i>

01:07:46.834 --> 01:07:48.317
What? What?

01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:49.601
I meant five seconds.

01:07:49.603 --> 01:07:50.903
<i>Damn it, chief!</i>

01:07:50.905 --> 01:07:53.238
Sorry, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.174
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

01:07:56.176 --> 01:07:58.076
Sorry about your phone.

01:07:58.078 --> 01:08:00.012
Can you hear me now?

01:08:02.715 --> 01:08:04.800
<i>Chief, can you hear me?</i>

01:08:04.802 --> 01:08:07.586
<i>Costa Coral hotel.
Good afternoon.</i>

01:08:07.588 --> 01:08:09.588
I just checked in
to your hotel.

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.623
I'm trying to access
my voice mail.

01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:13.892
<i>You're not in your room.</i>
I'm on my cell phone.

01:08:13.894 --> 01:08:15.293
<i>Okay, that's no problem.</i>

01:08:15.295 --> 01:08:18.263
Can you help me?
<i>Sure. What's your room number?</i>

01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:20.665
I don't remember.
I just checked in.

01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:22.734
<i>What's your name?</i>
Paul Cabot.

01:08:22.737 --> 01:08:24.770
<i>Okay, please hold.</i>

01:08:24.772 --> 01:08:26.171
<i>You're in room 715.</i>

01:08:26.173 --> 01:08:28.073
715. Okay, thank you.

01:08:28.075 --> 01:08:29.742
<i>To access</i>
<i>your voice mail...</i>

01:08:29.743 --> 01:08:33.011
Alex, we've got a Paul Cabot
at a Costa Coral hotel in Miami.

01:08:33.013 --> 01:08:34.479
It's on Atlantic.

01:09:05.178 --> 01:09:08.113
You're supposed to be here already.
<i>These people work slow.</i>

01:09:08.115 --> 01:09:09.509
Did you get those things?

01:09:09.535 --> 01:09:11.850
<i>Yeah. You got a TV?
Watch pay-per-view.</i>

01:09:11.852 --> 01:09:15.254
<i>Forget pay-per-view.
You got your wife under control?</i>

01:09:15.256 --> 01:09:17.221
<i>Is she cool?</i>
<i>She's not gonna...</i>

01:09:17.224 --> 01:09:20.358
She's not talking to nobody.
She's not going nowhere.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:22.493
She's got too much to lose.

01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:23.962
<i>All right.</i>

01:09:23.964 --> 01:09:26.698
Damn, man.
You take a terrible picture.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.167
<i>Get yourself over here.</i>
<i>We've gotta get out of town.</i>

01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:30.535
Right, right.

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:33.205
Excuse me.
How you doing?

01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:36.241
I left my key up in my room.
A knucklehead.

01:09:36.243 --> 01:09:38.743
715. It's Cabot.

01:09:38.745 --> 01:09:40.763
Paul Cabot, 715.

01:09:40.765 --> 01:09:42.631
Happens all the time,
Mr. Cabot.

01:09:42.633 --> 01:09:44.381
Thank you.

01:10:15.748 --> 01:10:16.849
Paul?

01:10:21.254 --> 01:10:23.655
Paul Cabot, it's the police.

01:10:30.331 --> 01:10:32.998
<i>And I fully</i>
<i>support that, you know that?</i>

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
<i>Absolutely,</i>
<i>but the thing is...</i>

01:10:35.002 --> 01:10:38.270
<i>If I'm gonna be a senator</i>
<i>by the time I'm 30,</i>

01:10:38.272 --> 01:10:40.672
<i>I need to start</i>
<i>thinking now.</i>

01:10:47.446 --> 01:10:50.148
<i>One of the reasons I wanted</i>
<i>to come here tonight</i>

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:51.750
<i>was to discuss our future.</i>

01:10:51.752 --> 01:10:55.020
<i>I am fully amenable</i>
<i>to that discussion.</i>

01:10:56.389 --> 01:10:59.191
<i>We've been having</i>
<i>all kinds of fun lately.</i>

01:10:59.193 --> 01:11:02.694
<i>Well, Harvard</i>
<i>is gonna be different.</i>

01:11:02.696 --> 01:11:05.697
<i>Law school is a very</i>
<i>different world, and...</i>

01:11:05.699 --> 01:11:07.799
<i>And I need to be serious.</i>

01:11:07.801 --> 01:11:09.301
<i>Of course.</i>

01:11:58.584 --> 01:11:59.501
Oh, fuck...

01:12:44.915 --> 01:12:48.400
<i>403, request</i>
<i>for driver's license info...</i>

01:12:59.678 --> 01:13:01.246
There's somebody up there!
What?

01:13:01.248 --> 01:13:04.949
There's somebody up there!
Oh, my God!

01:13:10.523 --> 01:13:11.706
Where?

01:13:27.973 --> 01:13:31.743
<i>So you're breaking up
with me because I'm too...blonde?</i>

01:13:34.713 --> 01:13:36.915
<i>My boobs are too big?</i>

01:13:38.184 --> 01:13:42.053
<i>So when you said</i>
<i>you would always love me,</i>

01:13:42.055 --> 01:13:43.688
<i>you were just dicking around?</i>

01:14:27.533 --> 01:14:29.134
See you, Mr. Cabot.

01:14:46.752 --> 01:14:49.053
Do you have a Paul Cabot
registered here?

01:14:49.055 --> 01:14:50.522
Cabot? Yeah.

01:14:50.524 --> 01:14:52.757
Someone was just pushed off
the seventh-floor balcony!

01:14:52.759 --> 01:14:54.759
How do you know
he was pushed?

01:14:54.761 --> 01:14:57.195
A man was seen climbing
back into his room.

01:14:57.197 --> 01:15:00.665
Calm down, relax.
Which side of the building was it on?

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:03.301
That's the guy!
That's him! That's Cabot!

01:15:29.128 --> 01:15:31.296
I'll take four.
You go upstairs.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.127
Stop!
Jesus!

01:16:03.129 --> 01:16:06.598
Mathias?
I pulled in right after you.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.766
Did he come down?
Nobody came past me.

01:16:08.768 --> 01:16:10.735
I'll meet you
in the lobby.

01:16:10.737 --> 01:16:12.604
Okay.
In the lobby.

01:16:24.617 --> 01:16:26.351
Get these people out of here.

01:16:26.353 --> 01:16:28.119
I'm gonna shut down
the elevators.

01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:33.191
It's him. It's him!

01:16:45.538 --> 01:16:48.005
Police officer.
Upstairs, upstairs!

01:16:48.007 --> 01:16:49.307
I'll cover the back!

01:16:56.682 --> 01:16:59.150
<i>The hell with that.</i>
<i>You got the money?</i>

01:16:59.152 --> 01:17:00.485
Yeah, I got the money.

01:17:00.487 --> 01:17:01.986
<i>Great. Where'd</i>
<i>you stash it?</i>

01:17:01.988 --> 01:17:03.622
Right behind the seat.

01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:05.923
<i>Flight number 601,</i>
<i>non-stop to San Jose.</i>

01:17:05.925 --> 01:17:09.361
I'm not flying to Costa Rica.
Get off the phone.

01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:11.129
I gotta go.
<i>I'll swing by your house...</i>

01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:12.731
<i>I'll pick up some underwear,</i>
<i>toothbrush...</i>

01:17:16.302 --> 01:17:18.836
Your new girl?
No.

01:17:20.005 --> 01:17:22.507
Weren't we supposed
to meet in the lobby?

01:17:22.509 --> 01:17:27.612
I just had to get my cell
out of the car, make a call...

01:17:27.614 --> 01:17:31.883
...back to the office,
you know, checking on a lead.

01:17:31.885 --> 01:17:34.319
Let's go back upstairs.
My boys are on it.

01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:36.621
Okay.

01:17:36.623 --> 01:17:39.424
Why don't we go have a talk?

01:17:40.626 --> 01:17:43.194
Sure.
Okay.

01:17:55.274 --> 01:17:59.243
You got something
you, uh...Want to tell me

01:17:59.245 --> 01:18:03.448
or need to tell me?
What do you mean?

01:18:03.450 --> 01:18:05.717
I mean something
that I ought to know,

01:18:05.719 --> 01:18:09.220
but that you might not
want to say.

01:18:12.124 --> 01:18:15.059
Congratulations
on making detective.

01:18:15.061 --> 01:18:17.762
I'm proud of you.
I never said it, but I am.

01:18:17.764 --> 01:18:21.733
I know you are.
You don't have to say it.

01:18:21.735 --> 01:18:23.735
That's not what
I'm talking about.

01:18:25.771 --> 01:18:27.905
How'd you get
to the hotel so fast?

01:18:29.107 --> 01:18:30.908
I heard it on the radio.

01:18:33.746 --> 01:18:36.214
So nothing else
you want to say?

01:18:36.216 --> 01:18:39.484
I'm gonna sign
those divorce papers.

01:18:39.486 --> 01:18:40.352
I'm not talking--

01:18:40.354 --> 01:18:42.253
I'll get to it.
I just haven't...

01:18:42.255 --> 01:18:45.857
When we leave here, I'll sign 'em.
Mathias, it's cool.

01:18:45.859 --> 01:18:47.492
We're in no hurry.

01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:51.996
Are we?
I'm not.

01:18:54.066 --> 01:18:57.034
You know what this place
reminds me of?

01:18:57.036 --> 01:18:59.537
When we first started
going out.

01:18:59.539 --> 01:19:03.040
Remember when we used to talk
on the phone for hours?

01:19:03.042 --> 01:19:05.943
And you had this thing.

01:19:05.945 --> 01:19:10.582
You'd say, "well,
I guess that's everything."

01:19:10.584 --> 01:19:15.069
And you'd hang up on me.
And then you'd call right back.

01:19:15.071 --> 01:19:18.790
That's right.
What would you say?

01:19:18.792 --> 01:19:21.092
That I love you...

01:19:22.428 --> 01:19:23.828
Very much.

01:19:28.401 --> 01:19:29.667
I liked that.

01:19:49.321 --> 01:19:50.522
Come here.

01:19:50.524 --> 01:19:53.157
Come here, you have
something in your hair.

01:20:55.387 --> 01:20:57.254
Chief. Chief.

01:20:57.256 --> 01:21:00.692
These are from agent Stark.
He sounded kind of pissed.

01:21:00.694 --> 01:21:02.327
See you tomorrow, okay?

01:21:02.329 --> 01:21:04.495
Detective,
the hotel called.

01:21:04.497 --> 01:21:07.131
The clerk's on his way
from the hospital.

01:21:07.133 --> 01:21:08.399
Detective?

01:21:08.401 --> 01:21:09.867
Call the insurance company,

01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:12.437
see if they found out
who the beneficiary is yet.

01:21:12.439 --> 01:21:14.138
Okay, you got it.

01:21:33.492 --> 01:21:35.727
<i>City Hall.</i>
Hi. Accounting, please.

01:21:35.729 --> 01:21:38.028
<i>Sure, let me get</i>
<i>that number for you.</i>

01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:41.198
<i>I'm sorry, they've</i>
<i>gone home for the day.</i>

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.033
Of course they have.
Thank you.

01:21:43.035 --> 01:21:44.736
<i>You're welcome.</i>

01:21:44.738 --> 01:21:48.606
Alex, did Cabot make any
phone calls from his hotel?

01:21:48.608 --> 01:21:50.274
We're waiting on them.

01:21:50.276 --> 01:21:51.776
Okay.

01:21:53.211 --> 01:21:57.081
Chief, the hotel called.
They left a message.

01:21:57.083 --> 01:22:01.586
The clerk left half an hour ago.
He should be here any minute.

01:22:03.256 --> 01:22:04.689
Great.

01:22:19.705 --> 01:22:20.805
Whitlock.

01:22:24.743 --> 01:22:25.777
Hello?

01:22:25.779 --> 01:22:28.145
<i>Matt...</i>

01:22:28.147 --> 01:22:31.482
<i>Matt, I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:22:31.484 --> 01:22:33.618
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:36.253
<i>It was never...</i>

01:22:36.255 --> 01:22:37.988
This is a surprise.

01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:42.993
There's so much
I have to tell you.

01:22:42.995 --> 01:22:45.763
I need to...

01:22:45.765 --> 01:22:48.365
You got a lot of people
worried about you, Ann.

01:22:48.367 --> 01:22:49.567
<i>I know.</i>

01:22:49.569 --> 01:22:53.337
We all had the funny idea
that you were dead.

01:22:53.339 --> 01:22:56.173
I'm sorry, Matt.
I'm so sorry.

01:22:56.175 --> 01:22:58.810
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
Where's Chris?

01:22:58.812 --> 01:23:01.946
<i>Oh, God, I've lied</i>
<i>to you so much.</i>

01:23:01.948 --> 01:23:03.648
He forced me to do this.

01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:08.018
<i>He and his friend Paul found
out about the Scarcetti thing.</i>

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:10.054
<i>They stole bodies</i>
<i>from the morgue.</i>

01:23:10.056 --> 01:23:12.189
You switched
the dental records.

01:23:12.191 --> 01:23:13.390
<i>I had to.</i>

01:23:13.392 --> 01:23:15.626
<i>I had to.</i>
<i>They--</i>

01:23:15.628 --> 01:23:18.228
<i>they said they'd kill me.</i>

01:23:18.230 --> 01:23:20.197
<i>See, Paul was</i>
<i>a criminal, Matt.</i>

01:23:20.199 --> 01:23:22.900
He was?
<i>Yes.</i>

01:23:22.902 --> 01:23:25.670
<i>He was killed today.</i>

01:23:25.672 --> 01:23:27.605
<i>They made me do this.</i>

01:23:29.675 --> 01:23:32.677
<i>Now it looks like</i>
<i>you and I faked my death</i>

01:23:32.679 --> 01:23:35.045
to collect on
the insurance policy.

01:23:38.183 --> 01:23:40.518
So what do you want me to do?

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.520
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to have to face them</i>

01:23:42.522 --> 01:23:45.022
<i>and have to answer</i>
<i>questions about this.</i>

01:23:45.024 --> 01:23:48.392
<i>I've gotta get out of town,</i>
<i>but I don't know where to go.</i>

01:23:48.394 --> 01:23:50.595
<i>And I need money.</i>

01:23:51.997 --> 01:23:53.764
So where's Chris?

01:23:55.701 --> 01:23:59.203
<i>You're right.
I should have come to you earlier.</i>

01:23:59.205 --> 01:24:02.072
He's there, isn't he?
Yes.

01:24:02.074 --> 01:24:03.407
Uh-huh.

01:24:05.443 --> 01:24:07.578
<i>I would have contacted you</i>
<i>earlier,</i>

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.147
<i>but I knew you would think</i>
<i>it was another trick.</i>

01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:13.017
<i>I don't blame you.</i>
<i>He beat me up and...</i>

01:24:15.153 --> 01:24:17.454
Matt?
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:24:19.157 --> 01:24:22.259
<i>He beat me up and...</i>

01:24:22.261 --> 01:24:25.530
<i>See, Paul had the money--</i>
I have the money.

01:24:25.532 --> 01:24:27.231
Oh, Matt.

01:24:27.233 --> 01:24:31.468
No, I don't want to involve you
in any more of this.

01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:33.070
Where are you?

01:24:33.072 --> 01:24:36.206
<i>I'm here at the old boat.</i>

01:24:36.208 --> 01:24:37.642
Stay there.
I'll meet you.

01:24:46.652 --> 01:24:49.404
I've interviewed her
twice already,

01:24:49.406 --> 01:24:50.855
and it does match up.

01:25:14.412 --> 01:25:16.881
Neil, detective
Diaz-Whitlock.

01:25:16.883 --> 01:25:17.882
Hi.

01:25:17.884 --> 01:25:20.284
Ouch. How you feeling?
I'm okay.

01:25:20.286 --> 01:25:22.620
You're up for answering
a few questions? Yeah?

01:25:22.622 --> 01:25:24.989
You need anything else?
This way.

01:25:31.329 --> 01:25:33.731
All right, Neil,
take a seat to your left.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.467
Here you go.

01:25:36.469 --> 01:25:39.770
Where's chief Whitlock?
I don't know. Bathroom, maybe.

01:25:39.772 --> 01:25:42.873
Alex, insurance
company, line two.

01:25:42.875 --> 01:25:44.308
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.

01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:45.876
<i>Detective,</i>
<i>I got your beneficiary.</i>

01:25:45.878 --> 01:25:48.012
<i>It's a Mathias Lee Whitlock.</i>

01:25:49.347 --> 01:25:50.748
Thank you.

01:25:54.452 --> 01:25:58.889
Matt. Matt.

01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:28.753
Agent Stark, DEA.
I'm looking for chief Whitlock.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:45.402
How much was it?
485,000.

01:26:45.404 --> 01:26:47.905
Did he arrange to have it
picked up or dropped off?

01:26:47.907 --> 01:26:50.307
He told my agents he was
sending it to my office.

01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:51.575
Nobody showed.

01:26:51.577 --> 01:26:54.111
I'm sure there was just
a miscommunication.

01:30:23.889 --> 01:30:25.856
That's a .38, Chris.

01:30:27.592 --> 01:30:29.326
Only six shots.

01:30:50.681 --> 01:30:53.350
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

01:31:21.546 --> 01:31:22.779
He's gone.

01:31:28.987 --> 01:31:30.387
You all right?

01:31:33.191 --> 01:31:34.925
Give me the gun.

01:31:34.927 --> 01:31:36.526
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:31:36.528 --> 01:31:37.995
Ann...

01:31:37.997 --> 01:31:41.432
You said he beat you up.
It was self-defense.

01:31:41.434 --> 01:31:44.534
No jury would convict you.
Just put the gun down.

01:31:44.536 --> 01:31:47.071
You think Chris
did this to my face?

01:31:51.409 --> 01:31:54.644
I think you should
put your gun on the floor.

01:31:55.813 --> 01:31:59.083
What?
Put it down, Matt.

01:31:59.085 --> 01:32:02.486
I didn't think I could
do this, but I will.

01:32:07.025 --> 01:32:10.827
You set this up.
Put your gun on the floor.

01:32:10.829 --> 01:32:12.363
Are you sure?

01:32:12.365 --> 01:32:14.164
Mm-hmm.

01:32:19.871 --> 01:32:21.305
Don't do this, Ann.

01:32:23.241 --> 01:32:26.776
Where's the money?
Come on. Jesus!

01:32:48.933 --> 01:32:50.367
So you...

01:32:51.602 --> 01:32:55.105
We--we didn't mean anything
to each other?

01:32:55.107 --> 01:32:57.341
It's not important.
So that's not important now.

01:32:57.343 --> 01:33:00.377
It was just all an act?
Where's the money?

01:33:00.379 --> 01:33:03.980
Look me in the eye and tell me
you didn't mean any of it.

01:33:03.982 --> 01:33:06.650
Some of it!
Don't try to confuse me!

01:33:06.652 --> 01:33:09.953
I don't have any choice now.
You don't have to do this.

01:33:09.955 --> 01:33:13.857
I've known you all your life.
I know you're not a criminal.

01:33:13.859 --> 01:33:14.858
Matt, stop!

01:33:24.936 --> 01:33:26.303
What?!

01:33:27.472 --> 01:33:30.907
Okay. All right,
high-school sweetheart.

01:33:30.909 --> 01:33:33.643
You think I'm playing?
I'm not playing, Matt.

01:33:34.879 --> 01:33:36.280
Damn!

01:33:36.282 --> 01:33:39.616
I was aiming for your arm.
Well, you missed!

01:33:39.618 --> 01:33:41.418
Where is it?
Outside the door.

01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.088
Show me!
All right, all right.

01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:47.257
Just calm down. Just calm down, Ann.
Just wait.

01:33:47.259 --> 01:33:48.959
Just wait.

01:33:48.961 --> 01:33:51.795
Don't shoot me, okay?
I'm just gonna reach for it.

01:33:51.797 --> 01:33:53.063
Show me!

01:33:54.599 --> 01:33:56.600
Here it is.
Put it down.

01:33:57.868 --> 01:34:00.637
Wait, don't shoot me.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:34:00.639 --> 01:34:02.939
I'm--I'm-- I'm the one
that got you the money.

01:34:02.941 --> 01:34:04.374
I'm trying to
save your life.

01:34:09.481 --> 01:34:12.048
It wasn't all an act, baby.
It wasn't.

01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:15.785
I can't live broke.
Life ain't shit when you're broke.

01:34:15.787 --> 01:34:17.787
Shit!
Wait, wait, Ann!

01:34:17.789 --> 01:34:20.557
Ann, wait, no!

01:34:20.559 --> 01:34:22.493
Ann!

01:34:31.202 --> 01:34:32.202
Oh, my God.

01:34:35.706 --> 01:34:38.975
Anyone else up here?
No.

01:34:38.977 --> 01:34:40.310
Oh...

01:34:50.221 --> 01:34:51.655
How'd you find me?

01:35:00.665 --> 01:35:03.534
Are you hit?
No, I'm okay.

01:35:03.536 --> 01:35:04.969
I'm all right.

01:35:11.175 --> 01:35:14.812
It's Alex. Get me an ambulance
and a med examiner.

01:35:14.814 --> 01:35:16.246
No, I'm fine.

01:35:16.248 --> 01:35:19.249
I'm at the end
of Runyon Road on the dock.

01:35:19.251 --> 01:35:20.584
Hurry.

01:35:24.255 --> 01:35:25.689
Did you kill Paul Cabot?

01:35:27.926 --> 01:35:29.226
No...

01:35:29.228 --> 01:35:32.329
It was self-defense.
He was attacking me.

01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:34.231
I was trying
to get the money back.

01:35:34.233 --> 01:35:37.100
You were just gonna
hand the money back?

01:35:38.202 --> 01:35:43.106
That's what I was trying to do, Alex.
Then what's that over there, Matt?

01:36:28.987 --> 01:36:30.253
What do you got?

01:36:30.255 --> 01:36:32.890
Chris and Ann Harrison's
bodies are upstairs.

01:36:32.892 --> 01:36:34.291
The real ones.

01:36:35.359 --> 01:36:37.327
They were both
working for Cabot.

01:36:37.329 --> 01:36:39.162
Chief found out they were here

01:36:39.164 --> 01:36:40.998
and took care of business,
right?

01:36:42.634 --> 01:36:43.834
Right.

01:36:43.836 --> 01:36:46.369
Let's move.
Good job.

01:36:46.371 --> 01:36:47.771
Thank you.

01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:54.011
Thank you very much.

01:36:56.081 --> 01:36:59.349
Your guy never
showed up, Whitlock.

01:36:59.351 --> 01:37:01.384
Agent Stark?

01:37:01.386 --> 01:37:03.687
Yeah.

01:37:03.689 --> 01:37:05.823
You know, I don't care
if you're injured or not,

01:37:05.825 --> 01:37:07.825
I want that evidence money,

01:37:07.827 --> 01:37:10.327
or you're gonna be looking
at a case of your own--

01:37:10.329 --> 01:37:13.864
where the hell is Southeast
63rd street in Miami?

01:37:13.866 --> 01:37:15.766
53rd street, Chae.
No.

01:37:15.768 --> 01:37:17.735
I told you 53rd street,
not 63rd.

01:37:17.737 --> 01:37:19.336
No, you did not.
Yes, I did.

01:37:19.338 --> 01:37:21.138
I said Southeast 53rd--

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:23.107
you said,
"those assholes in the DEA

01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:25.976
are at 8400
Southeast 63rd street."

01:37:25.978 --> 01:37:27.711
I didn't.
I'm sorry, agent Stark.

01:37:27.713 --> 01:37:30.213
What I said was,
"those assholes from the DEA

01:37:30.215 --> 01:37:34.151
are at 8400
southeast 53rd," Chae.

01:37:34.153 --> 01:37:36.319
63rd.
Never mind.

01:37:36.321 --> 01:37:38.656
Just give them the money.
Give them the money.

01:37:40.324 --> 01:37:42.926
You don't have to count it.
It's all there.

01:37:42.928 --> 01:37:44.561
Have a safe ride home.

01:37:47.431 --> 01:37:49.499
Come on.
Assholes.

01:37:51.736 --> 01:37:54.872
It is all there, right?
Most of it.

01:37:54.874 --> 01:37:58.375
It's all there. Jesus.

01:37:58.377 --> 01:38:01.178
That's a pretty good one.
Nice touch.

01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.579
A little over the top.

01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:03.947
Which part?
Your part.

01:38:03.949 --> 01:38:06.616
My part? You're the one
that came in here screaming.

01:38:06.618 --> 01:38:08.085
What happened to you, man?

01:38:08.087 --> 01:38:11.055
Just never leave your wife.
That's what happened to me.

01:38:12.456 --> 01:38:13.991
I'd take the bullet.

01:38:14.826 --> 01:38:17.627
Be careful there.
It's a classic, okay?

01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:19.930
That grille work
comes from France.

01:38:21.066 --> 01:38:23.567
How you feeling?
Excuse us.

01:38:23.569 --> 01:38:26.837
Yes, ma'am.
Did you love her?

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.007
No.

01:38:31.743 --> 01:38:33.977
Why would you do this, then?

01:38:35.747 --> 01:38:37.681
Because I'm...

01:38:39.117 --> 01:38:42.019
Because I'm stupid.
Because...

01:38:42.021 --> 01:38:43.921
I thought I was doing
the right thing,

01:38:43.923 --> 01:38:46.924
trying to help her,
but it's no excuse.

01:38:46.926 --> 01:38:51.428
Alex, sometimes people,
you know,

01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:52.863
do stupid things.

01:38:55.066 --> 01:38:58.035
Especially when
they're still in love.

01:39:08.146 --> 01:39:09.913
Thank you.

01:39:09.915 --> 01:39:11.115
Let's go.

01:39:57.562 --> 01:39:58.662
Chae?

01:40:01.816 --> 01:40:02.800
Hello.

01:40:04.368 --> 01:40:05.335
Hi.

01:40:07.172 --> 01:40:09.239
How you doing?
I thought you were Chae.

01:40:09.241 --> 01:40:12.409
He called all worked up
about something.

01:40:12.411 --> 01:40:13.977
Okay.

01:40:13.979 --> 01:40:15.679
You, uh,
you want to sit down?

01:40:15.681 --> 01:40:17.047
Yeah.

01:40:27.158 --> 01:40:29.226
How you doing?
Good.

01:40:29.228 --> 01:40:31.661
I ask that already?
Yes. I said I was good.

01:40:31.663 --> 01:40:33.596
You want a beer?
Yes.

01:40:35.716 --> 01:40:37.567
I don't have any left.

01:40:37.569 --> 01:40:39.369
You can share mine, though.

01:40:41.605 --> 01:40:44.007
So what brings you
out this way?

01:40:44.009 --> 01:40:46.977
I just needed to move
the rest of my stuff.

01:40:46.979 --> 01:40:48.678
Okay.

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.914
That's cool, I guess.

01:40:52.516 --> 01:40:54.051
The house is a mess.

01:40:54.053 --> 01:40:55.285
Say, Matt!

01:40:55.287 --> 01:40:58.171
This came for you
at the station.

01:40:58.173 --> 01:40:59.622
Hi, Chae.

01:40:59.624 --> 01:41:02.326
You opened it? You opened my mail?
Yeah.

01:41:02.328 --> 01:41:05.462
Why you always opening my mail?
Read it.

01:41:05.464 --> 01:41:07.497
They just want you
to fill out the forms.

01:41:07.499 --> 01:41:09.432
"To claim amount payable
to the beneficiary

01:41:09.434 --> 01:41:11.468
for the sum of $1 million."

01:41:12.636 --> 01:41:14.771
What?
We're rich.

01:41:14.773 --> 01:41:16.406
The enclosed forms...

01:41:16.408 --> 01:41:18.775
We're rich.
How about that?

01:41:18.777 --> 01:41:21.144
$1 million.
Easy, Chae. Easy.

01:41:21.146 --> 01:41:24.882
He can't take that money.
I can't take the money?

01:41:24.884 --> 01:41:28.018
Why not?
It's a conflict of interest.

01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:31.488
He's the legal beneficiary.
I am the legal beneficiary.

01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:33.874
And he's one of
the arresting officers.

01:41:33.876 --> 01:41:36.459
What the hell's that got to do
with anything? So what?

01:41:36.461 --> 01:41:39.629
Tell him how much trouble
you can get in.

01:41:39.631 --> 01:41:41.164
Matt, it's a million bucks!

01:41:41.166 --> 01:41:43.700
It's the chance
of a lifetime! No!

01:41:43.702 --> 01:41:45.102
No, Chae.

01:41:45.104 --> 01:41:49.306
As his wife, I'm telling you
he's not taking that money.

01:41:49.308 --> 01:41:51.808
As my wife?
As your wife.

01:41:52.877 --> 01:41:55.012
Matt, come on.

01:41:55.014 --> 01:41:57.180
Come on, don't fall for that.

01:41:57.182 --> 01:42:00.317
What do you mean as my wife?
As your wife.

01:42:00.319 --> 01:42:03.387
You said you came
to move your stuff.

01:42:03.389 --> 01:42:05.688
I'm moving back in.

01:42:05.690 --> 01:42:08.708
This is great. Congratulations.
It's kind of fortuitous.

01:42:08.710 --> 01:42:10.627
You serious?
Yeah.

01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:12.562
Are you gonna behave?

01:42:12.564 --> 01:42:15.165
I'm actually afraid
to leave you by yourself.

01:42:15.167 --> 01:42:17.534
You won the sweepstakes, man.

01:42:18.803 --> 01:42:21.438
Matt, you can do this later.
It's a million bucks.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:23.307
Let's not lose focus.

01:42:23.309 --> 01:42:28.245
You know, a honeymoon fund,
a nursery wing for the...

01:42:28.247 --> 01:42:30.380
Matt, this is the--the--
the golden pot

01:42:30.382 --> 01:42:32.615
at the end of
the storm thing!

01:42:32.617 --> 01:42:34.318
Matt?

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.486
Just sign it
before you go in, huh?

01:42:38.456 --> 01:42:40.523
I'm not gonna let you
do this to yourself.

01:42:40.525 --> 01:42:42.826
I'm gonna be sitting out here
when you're finished.

01:42:42.828 --> 01:42:45.929
I can wait three minutes.
I'm a patient man.

01:42:45.931 --> 01:42:49.433
I am a patient man.
Come on, Matt!
