10:00.267 --> 10:02.853
It's marketing for the movie.
Ready for the concept?

10:02.853 --> 10:04.396
Full frontal nudity.

10:04.396 --> 10:07.649
Two bodies ravaged by time.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.443
And one dewy with promise.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.570
Nobody's doing a naked photo shoot.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.947
Wait, yes! It should be the opposite.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.033
You drowning in your season one outfits.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.117
- Oh...
- Did you get that?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.702
Season one outfits.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.829
And the actors in identical looks?

10:20.829 --> 10:23.040
Doubles, illusions.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.333
So cliché.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.043
- [haughty laughter]
- [elevator dings]

10:27.127 --> 10:29.546
- Don't be late.
- [case wheels squeaking]

10:33.425 --> 10:35.677
Hey, Oliver! [gasps]

10:35.677 --> 10:38.263
I saw <i>Page Six</i> today. Oh, my God.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.474
Sounds like your girlfriend's
about to get Jonked.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.684
I'd prefer if you didn't put it that way.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.353
Well, you gotta tell her though,

10:44.353 --> 10:47.481
'cause it's best to line up
a good orthopedic surgeon now.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.566
'Cause she's gonna need
a big hip replacement

10:49.566 --> 10:51.443
after he drops that Jonk on her.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.986
I'm sorry, you've used "Jonk"

10:52.986 --> 10:55.739
as both a noun and a verb
in the span of 10 seconds.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.700
Well, it can be both.
"The Jonk jonked my jonk till I jonked,"

10:58.700 --> 10:59.785
is a valid sentence.

10:59.785 --> 11:03.705
Well, he and I don't
sound that different.

11:03.705 --> 11:04.957
Both body guys.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.250
- You know, love protein.
- Mm.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.794
In fact, a lotta people don't know this,
but I-I myself

11:08.794 --> 11:11.129
- went through a steroids phase.
- Hm.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.257
Prednisone for my sinus infections.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.633
[Bev Melon]
Hm...

11:14.633 --> 11:16.343
That's so interesting.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.012
It's funny 'cause you don't strike me
as someone who would, like,

11:19.012 --> 11:20.430
"care for their body."

11:21.014 --> 11:22.432
Excuse me. I need to go find someone.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.768
Actually, uh, uh, uh,
I-I-I'm known

11:24.768 --> 11:28.397
as a bit of a Herculean figure
in the, uh, theater community.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.941
Usually picked second for softball,

11:30.941 --> 11:32.651
right after the lesbian stage manager.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.486
And I don't wanna brag, but, uh,

11:34.486 --> 11:38.490
I've been asked to be
a pallbearer. Many times.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.617
- [elevator dings]
- [doors open]

11:40.617 --> 11:42.452
- [production office chatter]
- [phones ringing]

11:42.452 --> 11:43.537
- [sticking]
- Ooh.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.957
What is this I'm standing on?
It feels like fly paper.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.042
It's a tacky mat. Production thing.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.669
I work here now, know all the words.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.005
"Comtex."
"Gobo tweeny up and over."

11:53.005 --> 11:54.798
"Grip." I can continue.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.384
- I can't.
- It gets the dust off your shoes

11:57.384 --> 11:59.511
so you don't track anything
into the sisters' nest.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.929
It's a kick-off gift from Eva.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.890
She has a full line of sticky products.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.393
Boob tape, wound glue.
She's huge in adhesives.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.937
Anyway, that's a wrap on me!

12:08.937 --> 12:11.690
I gotta go martini two-shot
that best boy. [clicks tongue]

12:13.984 --> 12:16.612
- This is a lot of suspects.
- [sticking]

12:16.612 --> 12:19.406
What'd Detective Williams call us?
Amateurs?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.075
Ama-- If that's even the word she used.
I can't remember.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.828
- It was amateurs.
- Yeah?

12:25.579 --> 12:27.956
Well, would an amateur pretend
to be making a call

12:27.956 --> 12:31.084
while secretly taking photos
for our murder board?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.045
- Oh, yes! Uh...
- [loud shutter snapping]

12:33.045 --> 12:36.548
- ...yes, I can hold. Yes, I'll wait. Oh!
- [♪ jaunty music playing]

12:36.548 --> 12:39.051
Yes, it's me, Martha! Hi! How are--

12:39.051 --> 12:42.721
- I just wanna order those nachos. Uh, na--
- [shutter snapping continues]

12:42.721 --> 12:45.307
Do you want nachos?
You don't? You don't want them?

12:45.307 --> 12:48.185
Can you put some, uh, papa de gallo...

12:48.185 --> 12:51.480
- [mutters] Pico de gallo.
- Paca de-- Pico de gallo on that for me?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.815
- Oh, look at this. That's so interesting.
- [shutter snapping]

12:53.815 --> 12:55.192
Good work. Good work, everyone.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.444
Yeah, that's fantastic.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.780
I really hope the camera's
pointing the right way.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.366
- Oh, shoot.
- [clicking]

13:02.366 --> 13:03.867
[whispers]
Okay, here we go.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.411
- [normal] Yeah. Uh-huh?
- [shutter snapping]

13:06.411 --> 13:07.913
Well, that's interesting! Yes!

13:07.913 --> 13:10.415
- [shutter snapping continues]
- Yes, I can hold, Martha.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.961
[whispers] How are we supposed to tell
if one of these people is the murderer?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.046
I guess we look for someone
who gets nervous

13:16.046 --> 13:17.923
when they see us poking around.

13:19.633 --> 13:20.676
Like him.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.469
[thuds]

13:26.224 --> 13:27.850
- [button clicking]
- [♪ curious music playing]

13:27.850 --> 13:29.184
Marshall, right?

13:29.184 --> 13:30.936
We need to talk with you.

13:30.936 --> 13:33.021
Oh shit, it's the whole trio.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.357
Uh, fine. L-L-Let's do it.

13:35.357 --> 13:39.027
We have a few questions about Sazz Pataki.
Did you happen to see--

13:39.027 --> 13:41.572
Wait, I'm a suspect?

13:42.406 --> 13:43.615
Oh, thank God.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.577
Sorry, I-I thought you wanted
to give me more notes on the script.

13:46.577 --> 13:49.872
It's just you're producers--
co-associate producers--

13:49.872 --> 13:53.125
and everyone's been hounding me
about rewrites, and I figured you...

13:53.125 --> 13:54.877
[ragged breathing] But no, I'm...

13:54.877 --> 13:57.546
I'm just a suspect.
[nervous laugh]

13:57.546 --> 13:59.006
Um, okay, great. So,

13:59.715 --> 14:02.342
ask me where I was
the night Sazz got murdered.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.052
- Not here.
- [shutter snaps]

14:04.052 --> 14:05.679
- Let's talk at my place.
- [elevator dings]

14:06.263 --> 14:09.516
- [gasps] Mabel! Hey! Hi!
- Hey, hi, hi.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.602
I just went down to
the lobby to look for you.

14:11.602 --> 14:14.313
Can you hang back
and talk with me for a second?

14:14.313 --> 14:17.566
Come sit down with me.
Let's see if we can pass the Bechdel test.

14:17.566 --> 14:20.027
[ropes creak]

14:20.027 --> 14:23.155
Oh, by the way, the checks landed.
What are we gonna splurge on?

14:23.155 --> 14:25.574
Oh, I'm probably gonna
sink mine into my business.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.785
I'm... a... podcast producer.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.871
Yeah. And I oversee a few--

14:30.871 --> 14:33.040
a bunch of projects.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.542
I'm sure you have
a million irons in the fire,

14:35.542 --> 14:37.544
but I do happen to be looking for

14:37.544 --> 14:41.715
a hot new podcast to adapt for
my next movie. So what have you got?

14:41.715 --> 14:45.260
Oh! Um, I have lots of ideas.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.804
You know, they're just not fully baked.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.348
Mabel, nobody needs fully baked.

14:49.348 --> 14:51.183
All you need is a hook.

14:51.183 --> 14:54.603
So what's your next podcast?
Go on. Hook me.

14:55.354 --> 14:57.356
- Like, now?
- Yeah, now. Why not?

14:57.356 --> 14:59.149
Uh-- Um-- The--

14:59.149 --> 15:01.401
The first one is about...

15:01.401 --> 15:02.736
people.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.155
Tall people, short people,

15:05.155 --> 15:07.616
all different-sized people.

15:07.616 --> 15:08.784
Hm.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.286
And, uh, there's, uh,

15:12.079 --> 15:14.665
another one about buttons...

15:14.665 --> 15:18.335
being pushed... because of... trauma.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.212
Ooh, I like that.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.965
You know what? Forget it.
None of these are really anything.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.802
Mabel, do you want
the advice of a senior VP?

15:26.802 --> 15:29.096
These ideas are fantastic!

15:29.096 --> 15:30.722
They're relatable.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.724
I mean, come on.
Who hasn't dealt with

15:32.724 --> 15:34.434
people and buttons?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.520
You know what?
I saw it in the shed.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.106
I said, "The gal under 80,

15:39.106 --> 15:41.275
she's the one you wanna bet on long-term."

15:41.275 --> 15:43.026
So, you know what?
I'm calling Billy Billberg.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.320
He heads up the podcast division
of our corporation.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.197
I can already see the potential!

15:47.197 --> 15:49.658
Building brands, spreading trends

15:49.658 --> 15:52.536
make that Gen Z
get off their asses and listen.

15:52.536 --> 15:53.704
Okay, so here's the plan.

15:53.704 --> 15:56.248
[snaps fingers]
You're gonna flesh out these ideas,

15:56.248 --> 15:59.918
and I'm gonna set you up
on a meeting ASAP.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.588
Oh, uh, uh, no,
I'm not sure about my schedule.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.548
[gibberish] I don't wanna hear it.

16:04.548 --> 16:07.676
Shh. I don't wanna hear anything.
Mabel, listen to me.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.721
They're not buying the idea
as much as they're buying you,

16:10.721 --> 16:13.891
so don't stress. Case closed.
[pop] We're doing it.

16:13.891 --> 16:15.309
- Uh--
- [elevator dings]

16:15.309 --> 16:18.896
[♪ rhythmic knocking on door]

16:20.981 --> 16:23.692
- [stops knocking]
- Ah-ha! It's me favorite trio!

16:24.401 --> 16:27.738
- Ah, when'd you grow the beard, lassie?
- That's not Mabel.

16:29.198 --> 16:32.743
Oh, well, um--
I's just leaving you dis gift.

16:32.743 --> 16:33.994
- Oh. Mm.
- There you go, Chuck.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.412
It's me old gran's soda bread.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.832
[sighs] Dropped your name.
Got meself a gig on the film.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.959
Just odd jobs for now,

16:40.959 --> 16:44.338
but I'll be, uh, doublin' for you
at the photo shoot later.

16:44.338 --> 16:47.257
[laughs] Oh, Dublin. That's...
Doub-- Oh, Glen!

16:47.257 --> 16:49.968
Um, you're a stunt guy.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.637
Would you say I'm physically fit?

16:51.637 --> 16:55.015
- [clicks button]
- Oh, sure. You're a right Conor McGregor.

16:56.225 --> 16:57.809
- [stamping]
- I'll scrap ya! Motherf--

16:57.809 --> 16:58.977
[water trickling]

16:59.603 --> 17:00.604
[recorder beeps]

17:01.313 --> 17:04.316
I can't believe I'm getting
grilled by the actual trio.

17:04.316 --> 17:07.694
[laughs] I've spent months picturing
how you would do an interrogation scene,

17:07.694 --> 17:10.906
and now I'm inside one! Wild.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.950
Y-Yeah, you're really living the dream.

17:12.950 --> 17:16.036
Um, can you tell us where
you were the night Sazz died?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.371
It's funny you ask--

17:17.371 --> 17:19.248
Marshall, this script is amazing.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.332
You like it?

17:20.332 --> 17:23.377
I love it! I've never seen myself
portrayed so accurately before.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.504
"Charles peers shrewdly at the evidence,

17:25.504 --> 17:28.423
his keen analytical brain
thumping with thought."

17:28.423 --> 17:29.842
Does a brain thump?

17:29.842 --> 17:31.802
Well, apparently, this one does.

17:31.802 --> 17:33.846
[Oliver]
"Oliver flits around the room,

17:33.846 --> 17:36.890
a septuagenarian Peter Pan
or a male Tinkerbell"?

17:36.890 --> 17:38.851
Okay, that's just bad writing, Marshall.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.811
- Pick a metaphor.
- [Mabel] Aren't you supposed to be

17:40.811 --> 17:43.856
printing out the photos
we took in the production offices?

17:43.856 --> 17:45.524
Fine, fine.

17:45.524 --> 17:48.527
B-But Marshall, take a look at
how you wrote me in the script

17:48.527 --> 17:50.612
because I do not walk like that.

17:55.701 --> 17:57.828
It's classic trio bickering.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.955
It's my favorite part of the podcast.
[laughs]

17:59.955 --> 18:01.582
God, I love you guys!

18:01.582 --> 18:04.334
[clears throat] But to get back
to your question on where I was

18:04.334 --> 18:07.045
the night Sazz died, the truth is...

18:08.380 --> 18:11.425
I've been trying my hand at standup.
Observational stuff.

18:11.425 --> 18:13.802
I-I'm more of a storyteller
than a punchline guy.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.804
Think Jonathan Winters meets Ali Wong.

18:15.804 --> 18:19.349
That night, I was in West Hollywood,
doing a set at the Laugh-eteria.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.809
Oh, I can show you on YouTube!

18:20.809 --> 18:23.437
Actually, that would be useful.
It's my first time doing this hour and--

18:23.437 --> 18:25.397
- Uh, that's okay.
- Wow. An hour.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.482
Uh, Mabel, we oughta let
this kid get back to work.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.860
The only thing he's guilty of
is great character writing.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.487
- [excited giggle]
- [Mabel] [sighs] I'm sorry, Marshall,

18:32.487 --> 18:36.408
before you go, is your beard fake?

18:36.992 --> 18:38.994
Oh God, is it that obvious?

18:38.994 --> 18:41.580
Th-This is supposed to be
costume-grade human hair!

18:41.580 --> 18:44.082
[Mabel]
I-It's a great beard, it's just...

18:44.082 --> 18:46.418
can you tell me why you have it?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.713
Uh-- [laughs]
Yeah, this is so embarrassing,

18:49.713 --> 18:52.049
but I-I can't really grow facial hair.

18:52.049 --> 18:53.842
I-It's my first time on set,

18:53.842 --> 18:56.887
and I wanted to sell myself
as a "real writer,"

18:56.887 --> 18:59.515
and this is the look, right?

19:00.224 --> 19:03.227
Oh, these aren't-- these aren't
real either. I have 20/10 vision.

19:03.227 --> 19:06.355
How could a writer of your talent
have imposter syndrome?
