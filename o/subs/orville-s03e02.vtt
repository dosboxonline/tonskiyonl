WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:05.714
(adventurous music playing)

00:21.813 --> 00:23.481
Sorry to keep you all waiting,
but trust me,

00:23.565 --> 00:25.066
this is gonna be worth it.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.568
We're getting a pool table
in the mess hall.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.736
No.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.863
We've been assigned to pick up
Vice Admiral Christie

00:29.946 --> 00:31.448
from Outpost 35,

00:31.531 --> 00:34.409
and then transport him to
rendezvous with a Krill vessel.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.911
Once there, the Admiral
will begin negotiations

00:36.995 --> 00:39.748
to allow Union access
to the Naklav Sector.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.791
That's on the other side
of Krill space.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.544
Correct. Union ships have
never had a conduit.

00:44.627 --> 00:45.962
Until now.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.422
Early indications are that,

00:47.505 --> 00:49.591
with treaty negotiations
going smoothly,

00:49.674 --> 00:53.011
the Krill may be willing to
permit passage, which means...

00:53.094 --> 00:55.472
entire regions of
unexplored space

00:55.555 --> 00:56.556
are gonna be wide open.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.641
Does he believe we
can trust them?

00:58.725 --> 01:01.978
That's the word. Christie's
one of the top Union diplomats.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.773
He was the guy who negotiated
the Din'jon Accords.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.609
So, if this all goes through,
will we be able to get in on it?

01:07.692 --> 01:10.570
Well, we were the ones who
shepherded the Lock Vai pact,

01:10.653 --> 01:12.572
and we are an
exploration vessel,

01:12.655 --> 01:14.491
so I would say our odds
are pretty good.

01:15.075 --> 01:15.950
Doctor.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.078
You okay?

01:18.161 --> 01:20.372
O-oh, uh, I'm fine.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.374
I just didn't sleep well
last night.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.959
Any questions?

01:25.710 --> 01:26.628
Gordon, set a course.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.088
Aye, sir.

01:34.052 --> 01:37.055
(adventurous music playing)

02:11.297 --> 02:13.091
ADMIRAL CHRISTIE:
Dr. Finn?

02:15.885 --> 02:16.803
Admiral.

02:17.053 --> 02:20.140
Whoa, at ease.
What's with the formality?

02:20.223 --> 02:22.517
Standing at attention in the
presence of an admiral,

02:22.600 --> 02:23.935
is Protocol 101.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.855
Well, can I come in, or do I
need to make an appointment?

02:27.480 --> 02:28.857
No appointment necessary.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.235
It's been a long time.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.778
It really has.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.573
It's amazing to see you.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.243
And this... your own sickbay.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.745
I always knew
you'd be successful,

02:41.828 --> 02:44.914
but Chief Medical Officer
on a Union starship?

02:44.998 --> 02:48.335
Boy, you must've had
some top-notch professors.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.669
One or two.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.047
Well, this one is
very proud of you.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.548
Thank you, sir.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.550
Please, it's Paul.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.427
<i>Admiral </i>Paul.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.387
Well, I'm as shocked
about that as you are.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.306
Oh, I'm not shocked at all.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.850
You always had the heart
of an explorer.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.268
It was only a matter of time

03:05.352 --> 03:07.520
before you left the university
for the universe.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.689
Well, most of my time now
is spent behind a desk,

03:09.773 --> 03:12.275
so whenever a mission like this
comes along,

03:12.359 --> 03:13.985
I jump at the chance.

03:14.819 --> 03:18.865
And I must admit, seeing your
name on the crew manifest,

03:18.948 --> 03:21.117
gave me a little
extra incentive.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.746
Well, you look healthy.
Time's been good to you.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.915
Maybe on the outside.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.708
But you know what they say:

03:28.792 --> 03:31.961
unmarried men look younger,
feel older.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.632
You're as beautiful as ever.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.051
Save your charm for the Krill.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.886
-You're gonna need it.
-(Christie chuckles)

03:39.969 --> 03:41.096
Speaking of which,

03:41.179 --> 03:42.639
I'm scheduled to
brief your Captain

03:42.722 --> 03:44.057
on tomorrow's negotiations.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.059
How about we get some
dinner afterward?

03:46.142 --> 03:47.769
Got a lot of years to
catch up on.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.897
Actually, I promised my kids
I'd stay home tonight,

03:50.980 --> 03:52.399
and watch a movie with them.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.443
You, uh...

03:55.527 --> 03:57.487
y-you have kids?

03:57.570 --> 03:58.947
Two boys.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.532
Um...

04:00.615 --> 04:02.033
I'd love to meet them.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.996
Maybe it's best if we just stay
focused on the job at hand.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.790
There's a lot at stake here,

04:08.873 --> 04:12.335
and I don't think either of us
need any distractions.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.254
Right. I didn't mean to push.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.674
I was just excited to
see you again.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.176
Um...

04:21.136 --> 04:22.429
for what it's worth...

04:23.722 --> 04:27.183
it may be 25 years
too late, but...

04:28.560 --> 04:29.728
I'm sorry.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.064
I don't want to keep you
from your briefing.

04:33.148 --> 04:36.526
Right. No distractions.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.958
(theme song playing)

06:23.049 --> 06:25.719
(dramatic music playing)

06:33.935 --> 06:35.687
(indistinct chatter)

06:35.770 --> 06:37.564
(soft jazz playing)

06:41.735 --> 06:45.196
I fail to see the purpose
of this gathering.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.324
Well, diplomatic receptions
are an old Earth custom.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.702
Think of it as a way for us to
get to know each other,

06:50.785 --> 06:52.412
before the real work begins.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.998
I think I speak for everyone
here when I say

06:55.081 --> 06:58.126
we very much hope
that this temporary alliance

06:58.209 --> 06:59.210
will become permanent.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.588
Do not "hope" too fervently.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.008
Once the Kaylon are crushed,
the alliance will be dissolved.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.010
Only then will we celebrate.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.888
Well, still...

07:18.646 --> 07:20.315
(utensil tapping glass)

07:20.398 --> 07:22.192
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.693
(music stops)

07:25.612 --> 07:28.907
It's not every day one gets a
chance to be part of history.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.243
But tonight, history is
being made in this room.

07:32.744 --> 07:37.290
As we prepare to begin an epic
journey into unexplored realms,

07:37.374 --> 07:39.417
we also take the next step

07:39.501 --> 07:41.586
toward healing the wounds
of the past,

07:41.670 --> 07:45.298
and forging a new path
toward lasting friendship.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.176
Here's to a better future.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.478
(soft jazz playing)

08:05.777 --> 08:09.114
Hey. I'm gonna take this bottle
somewhere else.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.240
You wanna join me?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.741
God, yes.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.244
Can you handle this alone?
I'll owe you one.

08:14.327 --> 08:18.039
Yeah, I'll just stay here
and give myself cirrhosis.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.094
I feel like we should make this
a weekly ritual.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.762
You and me, draining a bottle?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.223
-Why not?
-No argument here.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.225
(chuckles)

08:39.060 --> 08:40.395
You know,

08:40.478 --> 08:44.065
there's a line from a
very old book I once read:

08:44.149 --> 08:46.443
"It is only with greatest care

08:46.526 --> 08:51.239
that memory can be kept from
becoming a prison or a gallows."

08:51.740 --> 08:52.949
I'll go along with that.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.994
You know, I was married once.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.873
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.625
-You were married?
-Yup.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.128
How come you've never
told me this?

09:05.712 --> 09:08.423
Um, I don't talk about it often.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.883
Who was the guy?

09:12.510 --> 09:13.553
Wait...

09:14.179 --> 09:15.972
-No.
-Yeah.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.058
Admiral Christie?
Are you serious?

09:18.141 --> 09:19.392
You were married to
Admiral Christie?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.144
It was a long time ago.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.021
I was a medical student
at Union Point.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.898
He was one of my professors.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.693
We started seeing each other at
the beginning of my final year.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.862
Kept it a secret
until I graduated.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.656
And then, six months later,
we got married.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.243
The official story was that we'd
only been together a short time,

09:37.327 --> 09:38.411
and then rushed to the altar,

09:38.495 --> 09:40.747
but, I don't think
anyone was fooled.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.874
Never in a billion years
would I have pegged you

09:42.957 --> 09:44.709
as someone who'd
hook up with your professor.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.837
Everything forbidden is sweet.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.255
So, what happened?

09:49.339 --> 09:52.926
Long story short: I don't think
he really wanted a wife.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.429
He wanted someone
young and smiling

09:56.513 --> 09:58.264
to come home to at
the end of the night

09:58.348 --> 09:59.557
after a long day's work.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.144
Which was sort of how it was
when I was still in school,

10:03.228 --> 10:08.316
but once the ranks were dropped,
I was looking for a partner.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.818
He was looking for a bed-warmer.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.153
I gave him an ultimatum, and...

10:13.029 --> 10:14.239
he walked away.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.657
Were you devastated?

10:15.740 --> 10:18.284
At the time, I was crushed,
yeah.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.829
I questioned everything
about myself.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.748
Every way I turned it over
in my head,

10:23.832 --> 10:27.252
I kept feeling like
I was the one at fault,

10:27.335 --> 10:29.254
like I made a huge mistake.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.674
But, when I remember it now,
it's like...

10:32.757 --> 10:35.385
I'm watching
someone else's daughter.

10:35.468 --> 10:40.223
I'm sad for her, but I know she
needs to learn her own lessons.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.393
It must've been really hard
seeing him again.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.230
Oh, in a weird way,
I think it was harder for him.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.691
Well, yeah, I get that.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.860
The pain can be worse when
you're the one ending things.

10:51.943 --> 10:55.655
Personally, I'd always rather be
dumped than be the dumper.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.032
Same.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.201
Anyway, different lifetime.
On to the future.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.246
Well, maybe one of
the Krill is single.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.290
(laughs) That's a thought.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.125
And, hey, there's two of them.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.502
(laughing)

11:09.586 --> 11:12.130
I can't date anyone who dresses
more glam than I do.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.506
Okay, fair enough.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.467
(Kelly laughs)

11:21.931 --> 11:23.808
We have considered your request

11:23.892 --> 11:25.685
for passage through
our territory,

11:25.769 --> 11:27.312
and we are prepared to grant it.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.689
But, there are
certain conditions.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.358
We're listening.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.944
There is an uninhabited planet
in Union space,

11:35.028 --> 11:36.446
that is rich in harcarium.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.823
We use it in our
propulsion systems.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.201
We wish to secure
extraction rights.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.285
Where?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.913
The third planet in
the Obrall system.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.706
Well, I think that
can be arranged.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.709
I'll need to get approval from
the Union Council, of course.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.379
Passage will be allowed
for one vessel alone.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.713
If there are no...

11:53.797 --> 11:57.217
incidents, we will consider
further allowances.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.135
Well, I don't think anyone here
would object

11:59.219 --> 12:02.472
to getting the first solo crack
at unexplored space.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.516
No, sir, we would not.

12:04.599 --> 12:08.561
While in our space, your vessel
will follow this course

12:08.645 --> 12:10.271
to the Naklav Sector.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.857
Any deviation will be
forbidden to you.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.735
Not exactly the quickest way
to get there,

12:15.819 --> 12:17.404
but it shouldn't be a problem.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.446
Anything else?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.407
Upon entry into our territory,

12:20.490 --> 12:22.909
a tracking beacon will be
installed on your ship,

12:22.992 --> 12:25.995
so we can monitor
your coordinates at all times.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.623
That would be a violation
of our security protocols.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.291
I think it's all right,
Commander.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.085
We really don't have
anything to hide.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.628
Captain?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.549
I'm sure we can find
a way to accommodate.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.010
We have little to no information
about the regions

12:40.093 --> 12:42.595
beyond your space
that we intend to explore.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.056
Anything your cartographers
could share with us

12:45.140 --> 12:46.641
would be greatly appreciated,

12:46.725 --> 12:49.436
especially concerning
the Kalarr Expanse.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.480
You...

12:52.564 --> 12:55.692
do not intend to
enter the Expanse?

12:55.984 --> 12:56.901
Why wouldn't we?

12:57.152 --> 12:58.862
It is a domain of evil.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.364
What do you mean?

13:01.448 --> 13:04.576
Demons dwell within the Expanse.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.453
Could you be a
little more specific?

13:06.536 --> 13:10.290
The Anhkana warns of
Shadow Realms.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.584
Gateways to the depths of
the underworld,

13:12.667 --> 13:14.169
where demons lie in wait

13:14.252 --> 13:16.921
to possess the souls of
those who dare

13:17.005 --> 13:18.965
to stray within their reach.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.509
They corrupt all that is holy.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.429
Within their grasp,
even the most righteous

13:24.512 --> 13:29.225
can be forced to commit
unspeakable acts of depravity.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.187
Do you have any direct evidence

13:32.270 --> 13:33.980
that these "demons"
really exist?

13:34.064 --> 13:36.191
It is written in the Anhkana.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.026
That is all the evidence
we need.

13:38.109 --> 13:41.905
We appreciate the warning,
and we'll take every precaution,

13:41.988 --> 13:45.116
but that area covers
more than half the sector.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.951
We are explorers.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.953
So, if it's all the same to you,

13:49.329 --> 13:52.040
we'd like to see for ourselves
what's out there.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.336
We will not stop you.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.589
But, do not expect us
to save you.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.941
Consul, Ambassador.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.275
We wish you safe travels,

14:19.901 --> 14:21.986
and we want to thank you again
for your generosity.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.114
I know I speak for
the entire Union

14:24.197 --> 14:26.449
when I say there is
no greater gift

14:26.533 --> 14:28.368
than the promise of
new knowledge.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.913
<i>Sala tallo ka vaspa ko loy.</i>

14:32.497 --> 14:33.873
What does that mean?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.542
It is a prayer.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.086
For those who are about to die.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.304
(gears whirring)

14:48.388 --> 14:50.390
(power humming)

15:09.617 --> 15:12.912
<i>The question is, do we take</i>
<i>their warning seriously?</i>

15:12.996 --> 15:14.748
Tom, you're kidding, right?

15:14.831 --> 15:16.166
I mean, consider the source.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.252
HALSEY: <i>I'm just suggesting the</i>
<i>possibility that their claim,</i>

15:19.336 --> 15:20.920
<i>absurd though it may be,</i>

15:21.004 --> 15:22.964
<i>could indicate the presence</i>
<i>of some real threat.</i>

15:23.048 --> 15:24.466
<i>And because they're Krill,</i>

15:24.549 --> 15:26.426
<i>they process it through the</i>
<i>lens of their religion.</i>

15:26.509 --> 15:28.595
Which still doesn't give us
much of a road map.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.221
I mean, their religion is...

15:30.305 --> 15:32.057
confusing, to say the least.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.683
All religions are confusing.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.810
How do you think the priests
stay in business?

15:35.894 --> 15:37.437
<i>Did they offer any concrete</i>
<i>evidence</i>

15:37.520 --> 15:39.147
<i>to support their claims?</i>

15:39.230 --> 15:41.149
No. In fact, from what
we gather,

15:41.232 --> 15:43.151
none of their ships have
ventured into the Expanse

15:43.234 --> 15:44.778
in more than a century.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.405
The copy of the Anhkana
we have in our database

15:47.489 --> 15:50.116
has a few passages about
"Shadow Realms."

15:50.200 --> 15:53.745
Lots of colorful language
about soul-sucking demons

15:53.828 --> 15:55.580
with eight eyes and huge fangs.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.040
Horror movie stuff.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.333
<i>And if this were a</i>
<i>horror movie,</i>

15:58.416 --> 15:59.751
<i>I'd say don't go</i>
<i>into the house.</i>

16:00.001 --> 16:02.754
<i>But, obviously their religion</i>
<i>has a powerful influence</i>

16:02.837 --> 16:04.422
<i>over their perception</i>
<i>of reality.</i>

16:04.506 --> 16:08.301
Agreed. But it should not stand
in the way of Union exploration.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.804
We need to seize the opportunity
while we can.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.472
<i>Ed? What do you think?</i>

16:12.555 --> 16:16.142
Well, visions of horror always
have mortal origins.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.520
If there is something out there,
it's not supernatural.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.146
Could still be dangerous.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.190
Exploration always carries risk.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.775
I say we risk it.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.485
HALSEY:
<i>Very well.</i>

16:25.568 --> 16:27.153
<i>I look forward to your reports.</i>

16:29.447 --> 16:31.741
(romantic piano music playing)

16:48.883 --> 16:50.093
Hello there.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.386
Hi.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.846
Uh...

16:53.638 --> 16:55.890
I hear congratulations
are in order.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.309
Word travels fast
on this ship, huh?

16:59.811 --> 17:00.895
May I sit?

17:06.860 --> 17:08.194
Cozy place.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.573
I come here to work whenever
I get tired of the office,

17:11.656 --> 17:13.867
or when my kids are
driving me crazy.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.036
(chuckles)
You know what it reminds me of,

17:16.119 --> 17:18.955
that little bistro we used to
go to on King Street.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.248
What was it called?

17:20.331 --> 17:22.083
-Cafe Noir.
-Yes.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.543
Some fun times there.

17:24.794 --> 17:28.214
So, when do you leave
for Outpost 55?

17:29.007 --> 17:30.342
I'm not leaving.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.219
I'm coming with you to explore
the Naklav Sector.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.264
Isn't that a little unusual
for an admiral?

17:36.348 --> 17:38.558
Oh, yeah. They love keeping us
behind desks,

17:38.641 --> 17:41.895
but, um, this is too big
to pass up.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.231
I hope your decision didn't
have anything to do with me.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.399
No.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.403
Not entirely.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.991
But... you have been
on my mind recently.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.119
Is that...

18:00.872 --> 18:03.124
I take it with me
whenever I travel.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.001
Brings me good luck.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.879
DR. CLAIRE FINN:
You kept it all these years...?

18:07.962 --> 18:09.506
Selayan sunstone...

18:09.589 --> 18:12.217
not the kind of thing
you just toss away.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.346
It's too rare, it's too special.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.724
Do you still have yours?

18:22.894 --> 18:24.270
Paul, uh...

18:25.271 --> 18:29.150
I'm happy to talk about
the mission with you, but I...

18:30.860 --> 18:33.238
I don't want to dredge up
any more of this.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.491
The hurt ran really deep for me,

18:36.574 --> 18:39.994
and I had to work
very hard to dig it all out.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.746
But there's no...

18:42.706 --> 18:48.586
vestige, no small wisp of
feeling still there?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.964
I'm sorry.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.432
Just for luck then, okay?

19:16.906 --> 19:18.908
(intense music playing)

19:22.162 --> 19:24.497
All departments
report ready, sir.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.125
The Krill have given us final
clearance. We're good to go.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.626
Okay. Gordon--

19:28.710 --> 19:29.836
Aren't you forgetting something?

19:31.254 --> 19:32.297
Right.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.090
I d-- I didn't prepare anything.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.592
What's-a-matter?

19:35.759 --> 19:37.886
It's traditional for the Captain
to give a ship-wide announcement

19:37.969 --> 19:38.970
at the beginning
of a new voyage,

19:39.054 --> 19:40.138
you know, like
a little pep talk.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.639
I was gonna write something
last night,

19:41.723 --> 19:43.016
but I-I was just too wiped.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.560
Just speak from your heart.
That's all the crew wants.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.649
All hands, this is the Captain.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.611
<i>We're about to enter</i>
<i>unexplored space.</i>

19:54.694 --> 19:57.238
<i>I know you're all just as</i>
<i>excited as I am,</i>

19:57.322 --> 20:01.409
<i>and I know you're all</i>
<i>going to do your best, so...</i>

20:01.493 --> 20:03.870
let's give this
everything we got,

20:03.953 --> 20:05.413
and...

20:05.789 --> 20:07.624
may the force be with you.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.043
-How was that?
-Perfect.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.757
Set course and engage
quantum drive.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.143
Isaac?

20:27.811 --> 20:29.145
ISAAC:
<i>That is correct.</i>

20:29.729 --> 20:31.606
We haven't been formally
introduced.

20:31.690 --> 20:32.774
I'm Admiral Christie.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.818
<i>I am pleased to meet you,</i>
<i>Admiral.</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:36.861
Am I interrupting anything
important?

20:36.945 --> 20:38.113
<i>Yes.</i>

20:38.196 --> 20:39.406
Oh.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.784
<i>I am upgrading the</i>
<i>scanner array for our journey.</i>

20:42.867 --> 20:45.912
Well, I won't take too much
of your time.

20:46.371 --> 20:49.082
I must admit I was a little
dubious about meeting you.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.252
A Kaylon serving on
a Union ship.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.670
After what happened.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.965
But, I read the after-action
battle report.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.884
I see that you saved a lot of
lives. I commend you for that.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.678
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

21:01.761 --> 21:04.639
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.

21:04.723 --> 21:06.725
<i>The entirety of my</i>
<i>official report</i>

21:06.808 --> 21:08.727
<i>is available in the</i>
<i>ship's computer.</i>

21:08.810 --> 21:10.979
No, not about the battle.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.689
About Dr. Finn.

21:15.066 --> 21:18.278
I've heard from a few folks
on board that you two were...

21:18.361 --> 21:19.529
involved.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.281
<i>That is accurate.</i>

21:21.364 --> 21:25.076
Well, you know, I was with
Claire, too, a long time ago.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.495
<i>Then we share a</i>
<i>common experience.</i>

21:27.579 --> 21:29.748
After all this time...

21:30.248 --> 21:33.877
she's moved on,
but I'm afraid that I haven't.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.464
I hope you don't mind me
telling you this.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.715
<i>No, sir.</i>

21:38.798 --> 21:41.051
<i>I have observed many such</i>
<i>paradoxes</i>

21:41.134 --> 21:42.635
<i>in human relationships.</i>

21:42.719 --> 21:44.304
Well, to be blunt...

21:45.055 --> 21:47.557
I was hoping you could give me
some insight

21:47.640 --> 21:50.143
into what makes Claire
happy these days.

21:51.102 --> 21:54.189
<i>Dr. Finn values her children</i>
<i>above all else.</i>

21:54.272 --> 21:55.815
<i>She has often stated</i>
<i>that she would</i>

21:55.899 --> 21:57.984
<i>sacrifice her own life</i>
<i>for them.</i>

21:58.234 --> 21:59.110
Oh.

21:59.861 --> 22:00.820
Go on.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.239
<i>Her career as a</i>
<i>Union medical officer</i>

22:03.323 --> 22:05.867
<i>is also a crucial part</i>
<i>of her identity.</i>

22:05.950 --> 22:07.285
<i>She is highly empathetic,</i>

22:07.369 --> 22:09.829
<i>and takes great satisfaction</i>
<i>in helping others.</i>

22:09.913 --> 22:11.581
She always has.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.376
<i>Her recreational interests</i>
<i>include music,</i>

22:14.459 --> 22:16.127
<i>dancing, fine dining,</i>

22:16.211 --> 22:18.546
<i>rain showers and</i>
<i>sexual relations.</i>

22:18.630 --> 22:20.590
<i>Her preferred mating positions</i>
<i>include--</i>

22:20.674 --> 22:24.594
Whoa. Whoa, that's...
plenty helpful, Isaac.

22:24.678 --> 22:25.845
Thank you.

22:25.929 --> 22:29.015
<i>Am I to understand that</i>
<i>you find it...</i>

22:29.099 --> 22:32.227
<i>a challenge to process</i>
<i>her daily absence?</i>

22:32.769 --> 22:35.730
Yes, you could say that.

22:35.814 --> 22:39.150
<i>It is another common experience</i>
<i>we share.</i>

22:39.442 --> 22:40.318
(slight chuckle<i>)</i>

22:41.945 --> 22:43.822
(ship whooshes)

22:43.905 --> 22:45.824
(peaceful music playing)

22:52.497 --> 22:55.375
Passing the outer border
of Krill space.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.837
Folks, welcome to
the Naklav Sector.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.840
First Union ship ever
to come this far.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.466
Check it off the career
bucket list.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.428
Isaac. Analysis of
that star cluster.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.096
ISAAC:
<i>An O-B association,</i>

23:08.179 --> 23:10.432
<i>approximately two million</i>
<i>years old.</i>

23:10.515 --> 23:12.559
<i>78 blue giant stars,</i>

23:12.642 --> 23:15.270
<i>along with several dozen</i>
<i>F, G, and K stars</i>

23:15.353 --> 23:17.188
<i>in later stages of evolution.</i>

23:17.272 --> 23:18.523
Reminds me of Vegas.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.899
Any life signs?

23:19.983 --> 23:23.194
<i>I am detecting 347</i>
<i>habitable planets,</i>

23:23.278 --> 23:26.322
<i>but so far no indications</i>
<i>of intelligent life.</i>

23:26.406 --> 23:28.116
Wow, it really <i>is </i>Vegas.

23:28.199 --> 23:31.202
Captain, I'm picking up what
looks like a distress signal.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.746
Location?

23:32.829 --> 23:34.581
Bearing zero-zero-one
mark twelve.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.541
Distance: 16.4 light-years.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.044
That is inside the
Kalarr Expanse.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.587
I'm assuming it's no one
we know.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.963
Negative, sir.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.590
What about long-range scans?

23:43.673 --> 23:47.177
ISAAC: <i>The Expanse appears to</i>
<i>be almost entirely empty space.</i>

23:47.260 --> 23:50.555
<i>But there is one star system</i>
<i>approximately 30.6 light-years</i>

23:50.638 --> 23:53.475
<i>from the coordinates</i>
<i>of the distress signal.</i>

23:54.976 --> 23:56.311
Afraid to go in?

24:00.273 --> 24:01.983
Burke, set a course.

24:02.067 --> 24:03.651
Aye, sir.

24:05.862 --> 24:08.365
(power sparking)

24:08.448 --> 24:10.450
(whooshing)

24:25.465 --> 24:27.801
LT. GORDON MALLOY: Approaching
the edge of the Expanse.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.345
There are no stars.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.140
How far does it extend?

24:34.224 --> 24:37.602
ISAAC: <i>Scans indicate</i>
<i>at least 800 parsecs.</i>

24:39.729 --> 24:40.814
Take us in.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.817
Entering haunted house.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.131
We're approaching
the coordinates.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.175
What the hell is that?

25:20.478 --> 25:22.605
(ominous music playing)

25:32.574 --> 25:34.659
I am detecting no
propulsion systems,

25:34.743 --> 25:36.369
and only minimal power.

25:36.453 --> 25:39.164
It appears to be
a space station.

25:39.247 --> 25:40.957
Send a hail.

25:43.084 --> 25:44.336
No response.

25:44.544 --> 25:47.005
Maybe whoever it is can't
respond. They could be injured.

25:47.088 --> 25:49.090
ISAAC:
<i>The interior is pressurized,</i>

25:53.845 --> 25:55.805
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

25:57.057 --> 25:59.726
Talla, you're with Kelly and I.
Bortus, you have the comm.

26:02.312 --> 26:03.605
Aye, sir.

26:08.276 --> 26:10.278

26:29.464 --> 26:31.341
Anything resembling
a docking port?

26:32.133 --> 26:34.928
There's a large module toward
the middle of the structure,

26:35.011 --> 26:36.429

26:36.513 --> 26:37.806

27:09.546 --> 27:10.797

28:03.933 --> 28:05.477
It's an alloy of some kind,

28:05.560 --> 28:07.771
but it doesn't match
anything on record.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.232
It's almost like it's organic.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.069
Let's keep moving.

28:42.972 --> 28:45.433
-Life signs?
-Nothing.

28:59.823 --> 29:02.534
All right, fan out,
but don't go far.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.327
Let's search the immediate area.

29:31.688 --> 29:33.106
Better not touch anything.

29:34.232 --> 29:35.442
Sorry.

29:55.045 --> 29:57.339
I think I found the source
of the distress signal.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.177
Some kind of automated beacon.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.845
Maybe they got the help
they needed,

30:03.928 --> 30:05.388
and forgot to turn it off.

30:06.765 --> 30:07.766
Maybe.

30:09.601 --> 30:10.935
Captain, look at this.

30:23.615 --> 30:26.076
There's energy flowing
through them.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.621
Could be some kind of
power relays.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.839

30:40.006 --> 30:42.092
-(hisses)

30:44.135 --> 30:46.805

-I don't know. It moved.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.306
Moved? How?

30:48.390 --> 30:52.268
It, it opened up.
Expanded for a moment.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.692
Might be safer to analyze the
data we have,

30:58.775 --> 31:00.068
before we go any further.

31:02.362 --> 31:05.699
Mercer to Grayson. Doesn't
look like anybody's here.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.575
Let's head back to the shuttle.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.202
KELLY GRAYSON:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

31:22.549 --> 31:25.802
Isaac and I have gone through
these readings a dozen times.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.221
All we can tell you is that the
station is made out of some kind

31:28.304 --> 31:30.306
of highly advanced
bio-technology.

31:30.390 --> 31:33.393
How it works or why it's there,
you got me.

31:33.476 --> 31:34.644
Do you think it's abandoned?

31:34.728 --> 31:36.062
ISAAC:
<i>According to scans,</i>

31:36.146 --> 31:38.690
<i>there are no lifeforms</i>
<i>currently on board.</i>

31:38.773 --> 31:40.734
Well, at least not life
as we know it.

31:40.817 --> 31:42.068
What do you mean?

31:42.152 --> 31:44.487
It's possible there are
some lifeforms

31:44.571 --> 31:47.115
that are so different, our scans
can't even recognize them.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.533
It's a valid point.

31:48.616 --> 31:51.661
One of the fundamental questions
in astrobiology is:

31:51.745 --> 31:52.996
what comprises life?

31:53.163 --> 31:56.249
For all we know, the
outpost itself is a lifeform.

31:56.332 --> 31:58.084
Sounds like kind of a stretch.

31:58.168 --> 32:00.086
There are creatures on
Talarius Seven

32:00.170 --> 32:01.254
that look like rocks.

32:01.338 --> 32:03.298
However, they are
living organisms.

32:03.381 --> 32:04.466
So, what do we do?

32:04.716 --> 32:06.634
CHRISTIE: We'll continue to
explore the region.

32:06.718 --> 32:09.971
If we get lucky, maybe we find
something or someone

32:10.055 --> 32:11.389
who can shed some light on--

32:11.473 --> 32:12.599
(groans)

32:12.682 --> 32:14.017
Admiral? What's wrong?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.643
-(Christie shrieking)
-Paul!

32:16.353 --> 32:17.771
He's having some kind
of seizure!

32:17.854 --> 32:19.272
Help me turn him over!

32:22.942 --> 32:24.277
Oh, my God...

32:24.361 --> 32:26.321
(Christie groaning)

32:37.749 --> 32:39.751

32:45.965 --> 32:47.801
Twenty milligrams of diomine.

32:53.264 --> 32:55.892
(breathing hoarsely)

32:55.975 --> 32:57.310
All right.

32:57.394 --> 32:59.312
He's stabilized for now.

32:59.396 --> 33:01.231
Doctor, what the hell
is wrong with him?

33:01.314 --> 33:04.067
Something is re-writing his DNA,

33:04.150 --> 33:06.444
and it's happening at
an alarming rate.

33:06.528 --> 33:09.114
This growth contains
photoreceptors

33:09.197 --> 33:10.990
and a retinal nerve.

33:11.074 --> 33:14.452
It's almost like
it's a partially formed eye.

33:14.536 --> 33:16.454
Can you reverse it?

33:16.871 --> 33:18.623
I may be able to slow it down,

33:18.707 --> 33:21.042
but I don't know if
I can stop it.

33:22.293 --> 33:24.796
Whatever happened to him
over there,

33:24.879 --> 33:27.132
it's something our
bioscanners missed.

33:27.215 --> 33:30.135
I need more information,
and I need it now.

33:30.719 --> 33:32.429
(portal clanging)

34:20.977 --> 34:22.354
This is it.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.497
Anything?

34:40.622 --> 34:43.458
Some micro-particulates
of some kind...

34:43.541 --> 34:44.959
JOHN LAMARR:
<i>Lamarr to Captain.</i>

34:45.168 --> 34:46.378

LAMARR: There's something
going on over here.

34:48.213 --> 34:49.172
ED MERCER:
<i>What is it?</i>

34:49.255 --> 34:50.382
The distress beacon we found,

34:50.465 --> 34:52.217
is broadcasting a new signal.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.635
LT. TALLA KEYALI:
<i>What kind of signal?</i>

34:54.052 --> 34:56.137

35:38.805 --> 35:41.516
You were exposed to something
on the station.

35:41.599 --> 35:42.976
We're trying to figure it out.

35:45.812 --> 35:47.814
I feel so strange.

35:48.273 --> 35:49.983
Are you in pain?

35:50.483 --> 35:52.110
No, I...

35:53.820 --> 35:55.155
I'm just...

35:57.365 --> 35:58.533
scared.

35:59.117 --> 36:01.327
Nurse, would you give us
a moment?

36:01.411 --> 36:02.620
Of course.

36:05.874 --> 36:09.794
Paul. I'm gonna find out
what's causing this.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.672

36:12.756 --> 36:14.341
You get better,

36:15.258 --> 36:17.260

chocolate soufflé

36:17.344 --> 36:18.428

36:18.511 --> 36:21.014
(chuckles) Oh.

36:21.806 --> 36:23.641

36:23.725 --> 36:25.393

36:25.477 --> 36:26.895
(chuckles) Yeah.

36:26.978 --> 36:29.064
Well, you used to eat it
all the time.

36:29.147 --> 36:32.025
You were so proud of it, I...

36:32.734 --> 36:35.320
I didn't have the heart
to tell you.

36:36.404 --> 36:39.366
It tasted like dried leaves.

36:40.116 --> 36:42.660
Well then, either you
get better,

36:42.744 --> 36:46.373
or I'll serve it to you for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

36:47.415 --> 36:48.708
The ring.

36:49.709 --> 36:51.086

36:55.256 --> 36:57.008
You're not going to die, Paul.

36:57.092 --> 36:58.718
Please!

37:15.860 --> 37:17.821
Thank you...

37:19.739 --> 37:21.449

44:08.273 --> 44:10.066
It's gotta be in one of the
engineering conduits,

44:10.150 --> 44:11.443
I just need to find it.

44:11.526 --> 44:15.280
There are 132 engineering
conduits on this ship.

44:15.363 --> 44:16.698
Then I'd better get started.

44:16.781 --> 44:18.491
ISAAC:
<i>I will assist you, Commander.</i>

44:19.826 --> 44:21.244
Can you notify the bridge?

44:28.585 --> 44:29.711
TY: Mom!

44:30.795 --> 44:32.005
MARCUS: Mom!

44:32.756 --> 44:33.882
TY: Mom!

44:35.050 --> 44:36.134
MARCUS: Mom!

44:43.725 --> 44:46.644
Maybe she went home.
I'm going back to our quarters.

44:46.728 --> 44:47.937
Fine.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.606
Come with me?

44:49.689 --> 44:51.232
I already told you that
I'm not--

44:51.316 --> 44:55.362
(soft rumbling, snarling)

45:03.078 --> 45:05.038
(suspenseful music playing)

45:06.373 --> 45:09.959
(creature snarls)

45:11.378 --> 45:12.671
(roars)

45:26.267 --> 45:28.061
(creature shrieking)

45:36.986 --> 45:39.364
(snarling)

45:47.789 --> 45:49.833
-What is that thing?
-I don't know.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.016
Marcus! What are you
doing back here?

46:06.850 --> 46:08.560
-Did you see it?!
-See what?

46:08.643 --> 46:10.103
The monster!

46:10.186 --> 46:12.605
I don't know what you guys mean,
but there's no one else here.

46:13.189 --> 46:14.774
Come on out.

46:14.858 --> 46:15.859
Come on.

46:16.609 --> 46:20.113
There's something else here.
We both saw it.

46:20.196 --> 46:21.531
What did it look like?

46:21.614 --> 46:23.533
I don't know... like a spider.

46:23.616 --> 46:25.785
But big, like as big as you.

46:25.869 --> 46:28.496
Well, there's nothing here now.

46:28.580 --> 46:30.165
Why did the lights go off?

46:30.248 --> 46:32.250
We're working on
figuring that out.

46:32.334 --> 46:33.877
Can you help us find our mom?

46:33.960 --> 46:35.253
Of course.

46:35.587 --> 46:37.672
You guys stick with me,
and we'll look for her together.

46:37.756 --> 46:39.424
(creature snarling softly)

46:42.385 --> 46:44.554
(growling)

46:46.765 --> 46:49.684
(screaming)

47:04.783 --> 47:06.326
(roaring)

47:06.409 --> 47:08.411
(intense music playing)

47:13.124 --> 47:15.960
-(boys scream)
-Oh, Ty! Marcus!

47:16.044 --> 47:18.046
-Mom!
-Oh, thank God.

47:18.129 --> 47:19.547
Are you okay?

47:19.756 --> 47:22.133
What did we talk about
when there's an emergency?

47:22.217 --> 47:23.927
You're supposed to wait
in our quarters!

47:24.010 --> 47:25.929
-But there's a monster!
-What?

47:26.012 --> 47:27.847
There's something on board.

47:27.931 --> 47:30.558
Some kind of creature.
It got Lieutenant Woodson.

47:30.642 --> 47:31.601
We have to hide!

47:31.685 --> 47:33.186
Let's get to the bridge.

47:35.438 --> 47:37.357
(suspenseful music playing)

47:40.276 --> 47:42.028
And then what happened?

47:42.112 --> 47:43.988
It sprayed him with something.

47:44.072 --> 47:46.157
And that's when he
started to change.

47:46.241 --> 47:47.450
Can you describe it?

47:47.909 --> 47:49.369
His face...

47:49.452 --> 47:52.789
There were big black shiny eyes.

47:52.872 --> 47:54.416
And his skin was...

47:55.542 --> 47:57.836
it was like it went all rotten.

47:57.919 --> 47:59.963
That sounds like what happened
to Admiral Christie.

48:00.046 --> 48:02.757
-Demonic possession.
-Huh?

48:03.174 --> 48:05.552
The Krill warned us that this
part of space

48:05.635 --> 48:07.137
was inhabited by...

48:07.220 --> 48:10.598
demons who would
take possession of your soul.

48:10.682 --> 48:12.517
Something like this--

48:12.600 --> 48:14.686
it's exactly how they
would interpret it.

48:14.769 --> 48:18.023
The microbes that Paul
was exposed to on that outpost

48:18.106 --> 48:21.234
almost immediately started
rewriting his DNA,

48:21.317 --> 48:23.278
turning his cells into...

48:23.361 --> 48:24.612
Another species.

48:24.696 --> 48:26.906
When the Admiral
escaped sickbay,

48:26.990 --> 48:29.325
his transmutation
was accelerating.

48:29.409 --> 48:31.202
He must have infected others.

48:31.286 --> 48:33.288
What Marcus described
is most likely

48:33.371 --> 48:35.915
a more potent version
of the microbes.

48:35.999 --> 48:37.334
Reproduction.

48:37.417 --> 48:38.668
That's my guess.

48:38.877 --> 48:42.422
It may be that their, uh,
natural means of procreation

48:42.505 --> 48:45.467
is to hijack the bodies
of other lifeforms.

48:45.550 --> 48:48.136
Like a parasite,
only much more aggressive.

48:48.219 --> 48:50.764
Then the distress call
we received...

48:50.847 --> 48:52.223
It was a mating call.

48:52.307 --> 48:53.683
Oh, man...

48:53.892 --> 48:56.603
There's no telling how many of
our people have been infected.

48:56.686 --> 48:59.647
We need to contain the spread
as quickly as possible.

48:59.731 --> 49:02.192
Commander Lamarr
was attempting to restore power

49:02.275 --> 49:04.277
from within the
engineering conduits.

49:04.361 --> 49:06.738
He is likely unaware of
the alien threat.

49:06.821 --> 49:07.739
I'll find him.

49:41.773 --> 49:43.733
Isaac, I think
I found something!

49:43.817 --> 49:45.860
ISAAC:
<i>Do you require assistance?</i>

49:45.944 --> 49:48.238
I can't override
the Admiral's command codes,

49:48.321 --> 49:49.906
but I might be able to
rig a workaround,

49:49.989 --> 49:51.616
and get auxiliary power
back online.

49:51.700 --> 49:53.118
Stand by.

49:56.996 --> 49:59.165
(energy pulsing)

49:59.249 --> 50:01.042
Boom. There it is.

50:01.126 --> 50:04.129
(power surging,
circuits clanging)

50:04.212 --> 50:07.007
No communications yet,
but we got life support,

50:07.090 --> 50:08.925
interior illumination,
and backup systems.

50:09.009 --> 50:10.760
Anything more is gonna
take some time.

50:10.844 --> 50:13.138
ISAAC:
<i>I will alert the bridge.</i>

50:13.221 --> 50:15.098
Captain, we have minimal power.

50:15.181 --> 50:16.683
It's about time.

50:18.393 --> 50:20.478
Sir, I have to get to sickbay.

50:20.562 --> 50:23.440
If there's a counteragent,
I need to find it, and fast.

50:23.523 --> 50:24.899
Bortus, go with her.

50:24.983 --> 50:26.443
And see if you can gather
a security detail

50:26.526 --> 50:27.610
to man the perimeter.

50:27.694 --> 50:28.987
Aye, sir.

50:30.822 --> 50:32.157
Stay here, kids.

50:39.831 --> 50:41.708
(metallic clatter)

50:58.808 --> 51:00.894
(hissing)

51:00.977 --> 51:03.813
(roaring, snarling)

51:19.788 --> 51:22.040
(gas hissing)

51:26.211 --> 51:28.505
(distorted voices snarling)

51:49.526 --> 51:51.903
(snarling, shrieking)

51:57.659 --> 51:59.077
-Hey!
-(roars)

51:59.160 --> 52:00.620
Come and get me, assholes!

52:13.091 --> 52:14.634
(footsteps stomping)

52:16.344 --> 52:18.138
(stomping)

52:28.189 --> 52:29.649
-(roars)
-(Keyali grunts)

52:31.776 --> 52:33.695
(roaring, shrieking)

52:33.862 --> 52:35.030
(grunts)

52:35.196 --> 52:36.698
(roaring)

52:40.994 --> 52:42.871
(shrieks)

52:44.497 --> 52:47.250
(liquid-like crackling)

52:48.752 --> 52:50.462
(roaring)

52:53.965 --> 52:55.675
(shrieks)

53:00.138 --> 53:03.016
(roaring)

53:04.976 --> 53:07.103
(body crackling)

53:08.146 --> 53:09.689
(shrieking)

53:19.574 --> 53:21.242
(shrieks)

53:37.550 --> 53:39.552
(intense music playing)

53:42.013 --> 53:43.682
(creature roaring)

53:43.765 --> 53:45.809
(snarling)

53:51.231 --> 53:53.775
(creature hissing)

54:03.576 --> 54:06.329
JOHN: Hey! Can anybody hear me?!
I need help!

54:06.413 --> 54:07.914
Hey, somebody!

54:10.208 --> 54:12.127
Oh, Isaac! Thank God.
You gotta get me outta here!

54:12.210 --> 54:14.629
ISAAC: <i>Commander,</i>
<i>why are you in the brig?</i>

54:14.713 --> 54:16.673
Just get me out of here,
we gotta get to the bridge!

54:21.469 --> 54:22.679
Come on!

54:28.977 --> 54:31.187
Okay, boom.
Communications are back online.

54:31.271 --> 54:33.023
I had to divert power
from life support,

54:33.106 --> 54:35.025
so nobody breathe too heavy.

54:35.108 --> 54:36.568
Mercer to Finn.

54:37.235 --> 54:39.446
Finn here, Captain.
I'm in sickbay.

54:39.529 --> 54:40.989
Were you able to find anything?

54:41.072 --> 54:42.407
DR. FINN:
<i>It's slow going here, sir.</i>

54:42.574 --> 54:44.909
At least until you can get
full power back up and running.

54:44.993 --> 54:46.077
GRAYSON:
<i>We're working on it.</i>

54:46.161 --> 54:47.579
Is there any other way
we can help?

54:47.662 --> 54:49.372
Not unless you can get one of
those creatures

54:49.456 --> 54:50.749
to agree to a physical.

54:52.083 --> 54:54.336
Hi, doc. I thought you
could use this.

54:55.670 --> 54:58.965
Scratch that, Captain.
We have a patient.

55:03.720 --> 55:06.890
Sir. Long-range scanners
are detecting a vessel.

55:06.973 --> 55:09.059
Ten million kilometers
and closing.

55:09.142 --> 55:10.685
Let's see it.

55:14.898 --> 55:16.066
Magnify.

55:19.611 --> 55:22.655
Oh, boy, that can't be
good news.

55:22.739 --> 55:24.783
John, how soon
will we have quantum drive?

55:24.866 --> 55:26.409
Not soon enough.

55:32.916 --> 55:34.751
DR. FINN:
There's no recognizable DNA.

55:34.834 --> 55:38.880
Whoever this is, his genome
has been completely transformed.

55:38.963 --> 55:40.840
I can't even tell
what species he was.

55:40.924 --> 55:42.425
Is there anything you can do?

55:42.509 --> 55:44.803
If there was a fragment of his
original genetic template,

55:44.886 --> 55:45.845
maybe...

55:45.929 --> 55:47.180
I'll assemble a security detail.

55:47.389 --> 55:49.224
We'll go after them one by one
if that's what it takes.

55:49.307 --> 55:52.268
Whoa, wait a minute.
I'm reading white blood cells.

55:53.228 --> 55:54.562
He was human.

55:55.397 --> 55:58.817
The cell count is low.
Really low.

55:58.900 --> 56:00.235
What does that mean?

56:00.318 --> 56:02.028
It means the
transformative process

56:02.112 --> 56:03.947
takes an enormous toll
on the body.

56:04.030 --> 56:06.533
Based on the scan, it must be
at least a couple of weeks

56:06.616 --> 56:09.452
before their immune systems
are back up to full strength.

56:09.536 --> 56:10.829
Then they have a weakness.

56:12.163 --> 56:14.290
I could create a
synthetic virus.

56:16.710 --> 56:19.337
It wouldn't have to be any
stronger than the common cold,

56:19.421 --> 56:21.423
and it'd probably be
fatal to them.

56:21.506 --> 56:23.133
We could disperse it
in aerosolized form

56:23.216 --> 56:24.217
throughout the ship.

56:24.300 --> 56:25.552
They'd have no immunity.

56:25.635 --> 56:26.928
What about us?

56:28.096 --> 56:29.848
You might get the sniffles.

56:30.515 --> 56:31.808
I am prepared.

56:37.063 --> 56:38.857
Claire, even if this works...

56:38.940 --> 56:41.026
these are our shipmates
we're talking about.

56:41.109 --> 56:43.111
They didn't ask for what
happened to them.

56:43.194 --> 56:44.738
Are they still our shipmates?

56:44.821 --> 56:45.947
You heard her.

56:46.031 --> 56:47.574
They're a completely
different species now.

56:47.657 --> 56:49.743
We don't even know if there's
anything left of what they were.

56:49.951 --> 56:52.746
More importantly, it's us
versus them. I vote for us.

56:53.913 --> 56:57.000
If there was some way
we could communicate with them,

56:57.083 --> 56:58.835
to give them a warning.

56:58.918 --> 57:00.462
A chance to leave peacefully.

57:00.545 --> 57:02.464
<i>Maybe there's a way.</i>

57:02.547 --> 57:04.591
Scan the ship for
Selayan sunstone.

57:04.674 --> 57:07.052
-What for?
-Just do it, please.

57:08.928 --> 57:10.597
<i>It's a rare mineral.</i>

57:10.680 --> 57:12.182
<i>Our...</i>

57:12.265 --> 57:14.017
<i>wedding rings were</i>
<i>made from it.</i>

57:14.100 --> 57:15.685
<i>Paul was wearing his.</i>

57:15.769 --> 57:19.314
If he still has it,
we may be able to locate him.

57:19.397 --> 57:20.357
<i>And then what?</i>

57:20.565 --> 57:23.151
If any small part of him
still exists...

57:23.234 --> 57:24.611
maybe I can reach him.

57:24.694 --> 57:26.279
MERCER:
<i>Doctor, you can't be serious.</i>

57:26.363 --> 57:27.655
If he comes after you,

57:27.739 --> 57:30.367
-there's no way--
<i>-I know. I know the risks.</i>

57:30.450 --> 57:33.286
<i>Please, Captain. I need to try.</i>

57:35.372 --> 57:38.792
I found a trace of something
that could be sunstone.

57:38.875 --> 57:40.251
It's in Engineering.

57:42.962 --> 57:44.881
(suspenseful music playing)

57:54.933 --> 57:57.018
(roaring)

57:59.604 --> 58:01.731
(hissing)

58:03.775 --> 58:05.652
(creature yelping)

58:38.768 --> 58:40.020
Paul?

58:41.146 --> 58:42.814
It's me, Claire.

58:44.441 --> 58:46.234
I have to talk to you.

58:47.569 --> 58:50.030
You need to hear what
I have to say.

58:50.113 --> 58:52.407
Your life depends on it.

58:52.490 --> 58:54.993
-(ship rattling)
-(scurrying, soft snarling)

59:15.430 --> 59:18.141
We've found a weakness
in your biology.

59:18.224 --> 59:20.393
I've created a virus.

59:20.477 --> 59:23.188
You won't survive, any of you.

59:23.271 --> 59:24.981
We're prepared to use it,

59:25.065 --> 59:28.193
if you don't leave
the Orville immediately.

59:31.363 --> 59:34.741
There's a ship headed our way.
We know it's one of yours.

59:34.824 --> 59:37.410
Take your people and go.

59:38.495 --> 59:39.662
(quiet snarling)

59:45.293 --> 59:47.212
(loud, unsteady breathing)

59:51.299 --> 59:52.384
Paul...

59:53.760 --> 59:57.681
If any small part of you
is still in there...

59:59.808 --> 01:00:02.519
I want you to try to remember...

01:00:02.602 --> 01:00:03.603
when we were together.

01:00:04.562 --> 01:00:07.107
Remember how stubborn I was?

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.484
Well, that hasn't changed.

01:00:11.194 --> 01:00:14.114
Take your people and go...

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:19.786
or I swear we'll destroy
every last one of you.

01:00:21.121 --> 01:00:23.748
(gruffly): Not Paul.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.167
More.

01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:32.132
You... will... see.

01:00:32.507 --> 01:00:33.967
See what?

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:37.262
You will be...

01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:40.473
of us.

01:00:42.308 --> 01:00:43.643
Finn to bridge.

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:44.936
MERCER:
<i>Mercer here.</i>

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.022
DR. FINN:
Prepare to release the toxin.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.067
Start with the engineering deck.

01:00:51.151 --> 01:00:52.485
MERCER:
<i>Understood.</i>

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:57.574
(creature shrieking)

01:00:58.908 --> 01:01:00.535
(electronics buzzing)

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:04.247
(shrieking continues)

01:01:05.623 --> 01:01:08.668
(creatures wailing)

01:01:12.922 --> 01:01:14.841
(wailing fades)

01:01:15.717 --> 01:01:18.303
We go.

01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:20.597
Thank you.

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:25.769
Not forever.

01:01:27.812 --> 01:01:30.690
(intense music playing)

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.567
(feet scampering)

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:34.819
(portals thudding)

01:01:55.548 --> 01:01:57.509
(romantic piano music playing)

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:11.022
ISAAC:
<i>Good evening, Dr. Finn.</i>

01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:12.565
Isaac.

01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:15.110
W-What are you doing here?

01:02:15.193 --> 01:02:17.153
<i>I am checking on you.</i>

01:02:17.862 --> 01:02:18.780
Excuse me?

01:02:18.863 --> 01:02:20.073
<i>I have observed</i>

01:02:20.156 --> 01:02:22.117
<i>that when a crew member</i>
<i>aboard the Orville</i>

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.077
<i>endures a traumatic occurrence,</i>

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.579
<i>other members of their</i>
<i>immediate social construct</i>

01:02:26.663 --> 01:02:28.915
<i>inquire how they are doing.</i>

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:30.917
That's true.

01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:32.877
<i>How are you doing?</i>

01:02:34.212 --> 01:02:35.588
I'm okay.

01:02:35.672 --> 01:02:36.673
<i>Very well.</i>

01:02:38.299 --> 01:02:39.175
Wait.

01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:47.767
I hear the Admiralty's suspended

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:51.104
further exploration of the
Naklav Sector for the moment.

01:02:51.187 --> 01:02:52.647
<i>That is correct.</i>

01:02:52.731 --> 01:02:54.107
Probably for the best.

01:02:55.233 --> 01:02:56.484
<i>I...</i>

01:02:56.568 --> 01:02:58.820
<i>wish to offer my condolences</i>

01:02:59.612 --> 01:03:01.614
<i>on the loss of your friend.</i>

01:03:02.365 --> 01:03:04.075
Well, that's very kind of you.

01:03:05.118 --> 01:03:07.120
Paul was a special person.

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:11.416
I'm just glad I got to see him
one last time.

01:03:11.499 --> 01:03:14.002
<i>He spoke favorably of you</i>
<i>as well.</i>

01:03:14.085 --> 01:03:17.505
You... talked about me?
With Paul?

01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:21.384
<i>Our shared history of social</i>
<i>and sexual intimacy with you</i>

01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:23.553
<i>provided a common frame</i>
<i>of reference.</i>

01:03:23.636 --> 01:03:25.221
(laughs)

01:03:28.683 --> 01:03:30.602
Do you know, I have missed you.

01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:32.270
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:35.648
Do you want to sit down?

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:40.111
(romantic piano music playing)

01:03:58.046 --> 01:04:00.632
