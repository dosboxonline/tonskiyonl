- [All] L'chaim.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.670
Welcome home.

01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:28.640
What the fuck kind of maître d' are you?

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.220
New guy rolls into the joint,
you don't even show him around.

01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:33.100
- [Patsy] Yeah.
- [Cockeye] What's the matter with you?

01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:37.100
- I didn't know. Eh, Noodles, I'm sorry.
- [Noodles] You're some bunch of shtunks.

01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:39.650
- You don't come up and get me?
- [Cockeye] He's the shtunk.

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.900
- Shtunk?
- Yeah, shtunk.

01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:44.400
- He said you weren't out till Monday.
- You can get him the
next time he gets out.

01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:48.610
- Ha-ha-ha.
- God forbid. God forbid.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:57.420
[All]
Whoa! Whoa! Ha-ha-ha.

01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:09.890
Come on, let's see if you can
guess who it is.

01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:14.770
[Noodles]
Mmm.

01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:18.390
Charlotte Russe. With a little
too much whipped cream.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.440
(Laughing)

01:43:20.610 --> 01:43:22.110
Peggy.

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:30.620
Hey, you watch it, now.
And my prices, they've gone up.

01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:35.620
I work in a high-class joint now.
And I get paid by the pound.

01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:36.790
Whoa!

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.790
My Peggy, she's worth every penny
of it too, my red hot mama.

01:43:42.670 --> 01:43:44.630
Come on, come on. Eh, eh, eh.

01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:46.800
You fuck.

01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:48.420
[Cockeye]
Timber!

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:53.510
You've seen your old pals,
now I want you to meet
some new ones. Come on.

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.640
- [Noodles] Peggeleh, I'll see you later.
- [Max] You going to lay
here all night or what?

01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:05.980
(Sighs)

01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:11.950
Cockeye wanted to play with the band.
I'm serious.

01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:20.370
Come on.

01:44:47.190 --> 01:44:50.650
- Aren't you going to say hello?
- Hello.

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:54.570
[ Music Stops ]

01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:58.240
[ Band Playing Joseph LaCalle
- AMAPOLA ]

01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:14.510
- Your brother's a real friend.
- He's a romantic.

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:29.730
- Max tell you I was getting out today?
- Max? No.

01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:35.070
- You remembered yourself?
- No, Moe. It's always Moe.

01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:41.700
Yeah.

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:52.420
You mean you weren't counting the days?

01:45:52.590 --> 01:45:58.100
Of course I was. 4344, 4343...

01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:00.600
I lost track at 3000.

01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:03.930
- That wasn't my choice.
- Yes, it was. It still is.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.570
Well, anyway, did you come here
to welcome me back at least?

01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:14.950
I still live here. I was on my way out.
Moe said I should at least say hello.

01:46:16.450 --> 01:46:20.280
I hope Moe didn't have to
bend your arm or anything like that.

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:23.950
No.

01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:27.670
Welcome back, Noodles.

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.170
[Max]
Hey, Noodles.

01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.850
You dancing?

01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:44.140
Every night at the Palace Theater.

01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:50.310
I've made some progress since I danced
here among the brooms and the empties.

01:46:51.610 --> 01:46:55.820
You can come spy on me if you like.
If you have time.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.660
Every night.

01:47:15.010 --> 01:47:16.510
Noodles.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.680
Go on, Noodles,
your mother's calling you.

01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:34.650
It's good to see you again, Noodles.

01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:49.540
My pleasure.

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:01.390
- Did you get the wine?
- Dago Red. The best.

01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:10.520
How you doing?

01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:21.240
There they are.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.

01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:27.080
Did you see that movie, Joe?
It was a good movie.

01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:28.870
- Hey, Max, how are you?
- Good to see you.

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.660
Nice to see you.

01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:34.790
- This must be your friend Noodles.
- Noodles, say hello to Mr. Monaldi.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:37.090
- Hi, Noodles, how are you?
- I'm all right.

01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:41.590
It's very nice to meet you. But you don't
have to call me Mr. Monaldi like he says.

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:46.220
I like my friends and people I respect
to call me Frankie.

01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:50.770
Come on, sit down.
Get some chairs and some glasses.

01:48:54.610 --> 01:48:58.110
Sit down, relax. You're home now.

01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:10.790
This is my very dear friend Joe.

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:14.250
He came all the way from Detroit
to ask me to do him a favor.

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.790
And I want to do it for him.

01:49:18.130 --> 01:49:23.800
I don't have to tell you who
Joe is, how far he got, or
how far he's going to get.

01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:27.930
He's not only my dear friend,
he's my brother.

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:31.270
Frankie, I'll tell you the truth.
Even a Jew can't eat this shit.

01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:32.770
(Chuckling)

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:35.650
I mean, the mustard doesn't even help.

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.730
(Chuckles)

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:48.160
These guys with you?

01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:51.450
I told you these fellas are with me.

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:54.830
You could trust them.
You're in very good hands.

01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:58.130
Just tell them exactly
what you want them to do.

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:03.510
Move some diamonds from Detroit.
Kid stuff.

01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:11.390
Why us then?

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:16.020
If it's kid stuff, why don't you have
the kids from Detroit do it?

01:50:18.690 --> 01:50:24.360
Excuse me, Noodles. What he means is
that it's something that's very simple...

01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:27.990
...but for now, he needs kids
from outside to handle it.

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:32.750
He just found out they're going to move
these diamonds to Holland in a few days.

01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:34.870
So it's something came up right away.

01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:38.040
You understand?

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.430
Hey, Joe...

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:53.390
Tell these guys the story about, um,
the pussy being insured. What is it?

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.560
[Speaks Indistinctly]

01:50:55.730 --> 01:50:58.940
[Frankie] Tell these guys how you
stumbled on this whole
thing with the jewels....

01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:01.400
- [Joe] Oh. Come on.
- [Frankie] Tell them the story.

01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:05.360
The pussy insurance. The insurance
pussies. What is it? Tell them that story.

01:51:05.530 --> 01:51:11.410
Life is stranger than shit,
that's all. It's a pisser. No big story.

01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.080
I got this insurance agent,
this Jew kid named David.

01:51:15.250 --> 01:51:19.920
This kid conned me into every policy
in the world. Every policy, name it.

01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:23.880
Dogs, house, wife, life, anything.

01:51:24.050 --> 01:51:27.930
I'm drinking with the boys one night,
he comes in with his wife...

01:51:28.090 --> 01:51:31.430
...a pretty brunette with a nice ass
who works for a jeweler.

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.430
And he's still on the hustle, this guy.

01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:38.350
So I wink at the guys, I say, "Look...

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:44.320
...the most serious policy that should
be, you don't have me covered for."

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:47.320
He goes, "What's that, Joe?"
"Cock insurance."

01:51:47.490 --> 01:51:48.570
(All Chuckle)

01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:53.410
"You make me a policy that
when it don't work, I get a payment...

01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:55.740
...I'll write out a check now."

01:51:57.830 --> 01:52:03.670
He thinks, he says, "Oh, I don't know
if the actuality gauges govern this...

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:06.000
...but we can make a policy.

01:52:06.170 --> 01:52:09.430
But you got to guarantee
you're in good health now."

01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:14.300
"Oh, that's simple. Look, leave her with
me. Come back and see if it stands up.

01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:17.430
If it stands up, then you know
I'm in good health to begin with."

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:19.850
The jerk leaves her. I screw her.

01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:24.980
Not only that, she likes it.
And she tells me, she blabs
when her boss, the jeweler...

01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:27.190
...is shipping stones to Holland...

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:31.660
...where he keeps his stash
in a little drawer in the
safe. Everything in the world.

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:35.160
Can't ask for more, right?
Except, one better.

01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:39.500
I never paid the first premium
on the new cock policy.

- Being inside can change you.

Frankie to get rid of Joe.

With Frankie Monaldi, you don't
say "yes," then "no." Couldn't...

- ...take the chance you'd
change your mind.
- You're right. I would have said no.

in the palm of his hand.

If we're not careful, he'll have us
in the palm of his hand.

You don't get nowhere alone.

I thought you were the guy
that said you didn't like bosses.

02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:28.530
It sounded like a good idea then.
It still is.

02:01:28.690 --> 02:01:29.900
[Max]
Let's just think about it.

02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:34.610
They're going to ask us to come in
with them. There's a lot in it for us.

02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:41.540
Today they ask us to get rid of Joe.
Tomorrow they ask me to get rid of you.

02:01:41.710 --> 02:01:45.080
Is that okay with you?
Because it's not okay with me.

02:01:48.090 --> 02:01:49.920
All right.

02:01:51.090 --> 02:01:53.170
Let's just forget about it.

02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:08.060
Want to go for a swim?

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.860
Yeah, let's go for a swim.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
All right, what are you doing?

02:02:26.170 --> 02:02:29.590
Hey, Noodles.
Don't fuck around, Noodles.

02:02:32.670 --> 02:02:35.090
- What are you doing?
- [Patsy] Hey!

02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:37.510
[Cockeye]
Are you crazy?

02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:42.220
Shit.

02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:48.650
[Speaking Indistinctly And Laughing]

02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:52.480
[Patsy] That asshole!
I can't believe you did this!

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.710
[Brentley] District Attorney
James Lister was killed in
an explosion of a car...

02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:16.550
...belonging to Secretary of Commerce
Christopher Bailey...

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.010
...as he was leaving
the secretary's Long Island estate.

02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:23.600
Mr. Lister, who was killed instantly
in the blast, was scheduled to testify...

02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:26.940
...in Washington on Thursday
before a Senate committee.

02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:31.110
A committee investigating what has
come to be called the Bailey scandal.

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:34.650
A special team of detectives
has been assigned to the case.

02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:39.660
As for Secretary Bailey, he was not
available for any statement at this time.

02:03:40.530 --> 02:03:41.660
Did you know those guys?

02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:45.160
...at the offices of his longtime
legal advisor, Irving Gold...

02:03:45.330 --> 02:03:47.870
...in hopes of getting some comment.

02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:52.460
Mr. Gold, you're aware
that District Attorney Lister...

02:03:52.630 --> 02:03:56.550
...is the second witness in the
Bailey scandal to meet
a sudden and violent end.

02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.220
The first was Thomas Finney,
undersecretary of commerce...

02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:04.600
...who fell to his death from his
15th-floor office just a month ago.

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:06.390
Do you think there's a connection...?

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.560
Take the money and run, Noodles.
What the hell's keeping you here?

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:10.360
The FBI is looking into it. Ask them.

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.360
[Brentley] The only remaining
witness is the man who...

02:04:14.530 --> 02:04:19.650
...rightly or wrongly has given his name
to this whole affair, Secretary Bailey.

02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:22.570
- I'm curious.
- [Brentley] What does the secretary think?

02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:24.740
[Gold]
The secretary has no worries.

02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:29.750
Sir, if he has no worries, why
then has he retreated to his
place on Long Island?

02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:33.670
Far from retreating, he's busy preparing
his attack on the questions...

02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:35.670
...he will be asked by the committee.

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.380
I'd call them accusations
more than questions, sir.

02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:41.220
- The secretary has no worries.
- [Brentley] But the public does.

02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:45.930
Particularly in view of the rumors
about rigged contracts, bribery...

02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:50.560
...the international Mafia. Especially
those dealing with the illegal use...

02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:53.610
...of the Transport union
pension funds.

02:04:53.770 --> 02:04:56.110
Could you tell us anything about that?

02:04:56.280 --> 02:05:02.110
Gentlemen, I deny all of these rumors
and allegations against my organization.

02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:06.740
Our hands have always been
and will continue to remain clean.

02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:12.460
In my entire life, I've fought to keep
the American labor movement clear... 

02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:13.670
Him, I know.

02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:16.750
... forced speculation,
criminal elements...

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:21.630
...or corrupt politicians.
If any mistakes have been made... 

02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:24.930
He's still giving out
the same old bullshit.

02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:31.430
If any guilt at all exists
in this situation, it lies elsewhere.

02:05:34.150 --> 02:05:36.150
(Clicking)

02:05:39.610 --> 02:05:42.610
(Yells And Coughing)

02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:48.790
(Gasps)

02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:15.190
What's this I've been reading
about you in the newspapers? Hm?

02:06:17.230 --> 02:06:21.780
Inflammatory words from a union boss?

02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:31.410
[Jimmy] You still aren't going to stop
the workers or the social movement.

02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:35.210
Listen to me, you socialist asshole!

02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:40.710
We don't give a good fart about the
socialist workers and their movements.

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:45.880
We just want you out of the factory so
we can get the furnaces working again.

02:06:46.050 --> 02:06:49.050
This is the last offer
you're going to get.

02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:52.270
You want to sign it or what?

02:06:58.150 --> 02:07:01.440
Tell your bosses they can
wipe their ass with it.

02:07:01.730 --> 02:07:02.940
(Jimmy Groans)

02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:09.160
Fill her up.

02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:14.330
(Coughing)

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.560
This is my last... 

02:07:35.730 --> 02:07:37.690
(Tires Screeching)

02:07:43.150 --> 02:07:46.280
[Man]
Hold it, boys. Don't shoot.

02:07:47.490 --> 02:07:49.780
It's me, Crowning.

02:08:02.710 --> 02:08:05.460
- Crowning.
- Yeah.

02:08:05.630 --> 02:08:07.300
That'll do, boys.

02:08:07.470 --> 02:08:09.300
What'll do?

02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:12.760
We almost got the kid
where we want him.

02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:19.690
And we got the boss where we want him.

02:08:19.850 --> 02:08:21.440
[Patsy]
Easy.

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:24.480
Easy.

02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:30.150
Put them down.

02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:33.490
Put your guns away, boys.

02:08:43.290 --> 02:08:45.380
Just swapping prisoners.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.630
[Cockeye]
Fair trade, huh, chickenhead?

02:08:56.010 --> 02:08:59.180
Union boy over here for Mr. Boss Man.

02:08:59.350 --> 02:09:01.890
[Chicken Joe]
Well, look who's here. Ha, ha.

02:09:02.650 --> 02:09:05.400
Fat Moe's boneyard boys.

02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:07.650
Which reminds me.

02:09:08.070 --> 02:09:11.820
How's that cancer in your gut
coming along, Chicken Joe?

02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:13.820
(Sighs)

02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:17.790
- Untie him.
- I don't take orders from you.

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:21.120
We're not asking you to take orders, Joe.
We're telling you.

02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:23.460
Now go ahead, untie him.

02:09:23.630 --> 02:09:25.630
Untie him.

02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:31.630
Untie him.

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.920
Who are you?

02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:06.960
Who's paying you?

02:10:07.130 --> 02:10:08.130
(Chuckles)

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:11.050
I think this is really going to
piss you off there, Mac.

02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:14.760
I think it's those dirty, dirty
politician friends of yours.

02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:19.560
Yeah? Well, you crawl back and tell
him we don't want you in with us.

02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:23.480
Our fight has got nothing to do with
liquor and prostitution and dope.

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:26.520
[Max] You'd better
get used to the idea, pal.

02:10:27.230 --> 02:10:29.110
This country is still growing up.

02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:33.190
Certain diseases it's better
to have when you're still young.

02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:39.780
You boys have a mild case
of the measles. You're the plague.

02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:41.990
And bastards like him are immune.

02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:45.460
That's the difference
between us and them!

02:10:47.290 --> 02:10:49.130
Take it easy.

02:10:49.290 --> 02:10:51.300
The difference is that
they're always going to win...

02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:54.050
...and you're going to
keep getting it up the ass.

02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:56.180
Sooner than you think.

02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:17.700
Chief Aiello, moving policemen
into the factory came as a
surprise to everyone;

02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:20.580
The press, the unions,
especially the strikers.

02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:23.330
Well, what did you want, sweetheart,
a declaration of war?

02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:25.250
Ours was a peaceable operation.

02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:27.790
[Reporter] Well, wasn't that contrary
to the new union laws...

02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:30.170
- ... and the rights of strikers?
- I'm chief of police,
not chief of the people.

02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:32.670
Was there any violence by the strikers
to justify...?

02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:36.510
My motto is,
"Prevention, not repression."

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:38.760
But you let scabs move in
and start working.

02:11:38.930 --> 02:11:42.310
Young lady, you want to talk to me,
call them "unemployed workers."

02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:43.470
(Reporters Laugh)

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:48.020
With your permission, I'll take these
flowers to my missis before they wilt.

02:11:48.690 --> 02:11:52.650
Or maybe you heard.
I'm the father of a baby boy!

02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:54.690
(Aiello Laughing)

02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:57.360
[Reporter]
Chief, one more question.

02:11:57.530 --> 02:12:01.990
We heard he's the youngest stockholder
in that factory you occupied.

02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:08.660
What did you mean by that?

02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:12.000
They say management expressed
their thanks with a birthday
present for the baby.

02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:13.840
(Reporter Grunts)

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.260
(Laughs)

02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:19.050
You know, slander is a serious offense.

02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:21.470
Especially when it comes
from a hack reporter.

02:12:21.970 --> 02:12:24.720
You want to find out how serious?

02:12:26.850 --> 02:12:31.850
But since this is my first boy
after four girls...

02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:34.570
...I'll declare amnesty.

02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:38.570
Ha-ha-ha. Behave yourself.

02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:41.860

Thank you. Oh.

02:14:56.250 --> 02:14:57.830
- He's eating?
- Mm-hm.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.420
- For five.
- For five? Well, why not?

02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:04.380
You could feed an army with
these two milk plants. Ha-ha-ha.

02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:05.840
We could open up a dairy.

- The girls.
- The girls!

Sooner or later you have to learn that

My son, where is he?

ward. He never left.

He just got a little restless

they also wanted to change their beds.

First of all, you let the scabs in.

Second of all, you've got the cops in
there protecting them.

03:26:08.640 --> 03:26:10.810
[Max]
What are you waiting for?

03:26:14.650 --> 03:26:17.110
I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.

03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:45.890
Sit down, Noodles.

03:26:50.140 --> 03:26:51.940
Make yourself comfortable.

03:27:10.330 --> 03:27:13.040
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

03:27:13.210 --> 03:27:15.210
Well, I was curious.

03:27:18.170 --> 03:27:21.300
So many important people in one place.

03:27:21.510 --> 03:27:25.390
[Max] Yes. Well, the rats usually
desert a sinking ship.

03:27:25.850 --> 03:27:29.760
But in my case, they appear to be
flocking on-board.

03:27:41.400 --> 03:27:45.240
Yeah, well, I read about
your troubles in the newspapers.

03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:51.290
But a man in your position, with all
your power and all your privileges...

03:27:51.500 --> 03:27:55.750
...has to assume a certain amount
of responsibility...

03:27:56.420 --> 03:27:58.880
...a certain amount of risk.

03:28:06.340 --> 03:28:09.100
Why did you ask me
to come here, Mr. Bailey?

03:28:12.430 --> 03:28:16.940
That invitation doesn't mean
a goddamn thing, and you know it.

03:28:17.310 --> 03:28:20.860
All that counts is what
was in that suitcase.

03:28:22.530 --> 03:28:25.240
The money and the contract.

03:28:28.070 --> 03:28:31.280
It didn't say who the contract
was on, though.

03:28:32.620 --> 03:28:35.040
Haven't you figured that out yet?

03:28:36.750 --> 03:28:38.290
You, Mr. Bailey?

03:28:52.100 --> 03:28:55.810
I haven't had a gun in my hand
for many, many years.

03:28:57.440 --> 03:29:02.980
My eyes aren't too good,
even with my glasses. My hands shake.

03:29:05.860 --> 03:29:09.860
- And I wouldn't want to miss, Mr. Bailey.
- Cut the bullshit, Noodles.

03:29:11.410 --> 03:29:14.160
I'm already a dead man.

03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:19.500
At least give me the chance
to settle the debt that I owe to you.

03:29:20.170 --> 03:29:23.670
I'll never make it before
the investigating committee.

03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:27.800
They're scared to death
I'll implicate the whole bunch of them.

03:29:28.180 --> 03:29:30.390
They got to get rid of me.

03:29:33.060 --> 03:29:36.020
Today is as good a day as any.

03:29:38.190 --> 03:29:40.560
You do it, Noodles.

03:29:41.520 --> 03:29:44.900
You're the only person
I can accept it from.

03:29:51.780 --> 03:29:54.370
You see, I found out where you were.

03:29:54.540 --> 03:29:57.620
I brought you back here for this.

03:29:58.960 --> 03:30:02.170
To even the score between you and me.

03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:07.010
You can get out through there.

03:30:14.260 --> 03:30:18.810
It leads right down to the street.
Nobody will see you.

03:30:25.570 --> 03:30:29.940
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr. Bailey. You don't owe me a thing.

03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:44.040
Your eyes were too full of tears to see
it wasn't me burned up on that street.

03:30:44.880 --> 03:30:46.750
It was somebody else.

03:30:48.340 --> 03:30:53.260
You were too shocked to realize
that the cops were in on it too.

03:30:53.890 --> 03:30:57.100
That was a syndicate
operation, Noodles.

03:31:07.400 --> 03:31:09.400
You're crazy.

03:31:11.860 --> 03:31:16.120
You said that to me once before,
a long time ago.

03:31:16.410 --> 03:31:19.870
But my mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment.

03:31:20.620 --> 03:31:24.120
I took away your whole life from you.

03:31:24.330 --> 03:31:27.170
I've been living in your place.

03:31:28.380 --> 03:31:31.010
I took everything.

03:31:32.420 --> 03:31:34.590
I took your money.

03:31:35.220 --> 03:31:37.430
I took your girl.

03:31:38.140 --> 03:31:42.930
All I left for you was 35 years of grief
over having killed me.

03:31:44.520 --> 03:31:45.560
Now, why don't you shoot?

03:32:32.480 --> 03:32:34.490
[Inaudible Dialogue]

03:33:21.200 --> 03:33:24.120
It's true,
I have killed people, Mr. Bailey.

03:33:24.330 --> 03:33:29.080
Sometimes to defend myself,
sometimes for money.

03:33:29.370 --> 03:33:31.920
And many people used to come to us.

03:33:32.130 --> 03:33:35.050
Business partners, rivals...

03:33:35.420 --> 03:33:37.590
...lovers.

03:33:37.970 --> 03:33:42.090
Some of the jobs we took
and some we didn't.

03:33:55.480 --> 03:33:58.440
Yours is one we would never touch,
Mr. Bailey.

03:33:59.320 --> 03:34:02.280
Is this your way of getting revenge?

03:34:06.250 --> 03:34:07.830
No.

03:34:11.170 --> 03:34:14.290
It's just the way I see things.

03:35:16.980 --> 03:35:19.780
It's 10:25...

03:35:21.070 --> 03:35:24.240
...and I've got nothing left to lose.

03:35:26.370 --> 03:35:30.330
When you've been betrayed by a friend,
you hit back.

03:35:35.380 --> 03:35:37.210
Do it.

03:35:59.360 --> 03:36:01.980
You see, Mr. Secretary...

03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:06.070
...I have a story also.

03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:09.580
A little simpler than yours.

03:36:10.700 --> 03:36:15.410
Many years ago I had a friend,
a dear friend.

03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:20.290
I turned him in to save his life...

03:36:20.500 --> 03:36:22.800
...but he was killed.

03:36:24.090 --> 03:36:26.930
But he wanted it that way.

03:36:27.970 --> 03:36:30.180
It was a great friendship.

03:36:33.270 --> 03:36:37.310
It went bad for him
and it went bad for me too.

03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:44.440
Good night, Mr. Bailey.

03:36:53.620 --> 03:36:57.330
I hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing.

03:36:59.250 --> 03:37:03.300
It'd be a shame to see
a lifetime of work go to waste.

03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:49.690
(Engine Starts)

03:38:57.490 --> 03:39:00.910
