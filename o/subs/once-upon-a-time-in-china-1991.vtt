WEBVTT

02:17.895 --> 02:20.730
Look, look! They are shooting at us.

02:27.363 --> 02:28.613
Fire!

02:51.929 --> 02:54.681
- Oh! This is a dragon dance!
- Return to your post!

02:55.015 --> 02:56.141
Drums!

02:59.478 --> 03:01.187
Master Wong, be careful of the ship's cannons.

03:19.707 --> 03:22.083
- Want to come up? - Yes!

03:29.383 --> 03:30.425
Give me the tail!

04:18.432 --> 04:20.099
"Bravery Soaring."

04:23.854 --> 04:25.605
"Magnanimity Overflowing"

04:35.950 --> 04:38.034
Look, Wong...

04:38.285 --> 04:40.578
More foreign ships

04:40.829 --> 04:42.413
are anchoring in our docks.

04:43.582 --> 04:46.876
Britain has Hong Kong, Portugal has Macau,

04:47.211 --> 04:48.920
Russia occupies Heilongjiang.

04:49.338 --> 04:51.923
Our country is divided

04:52.174 --> 04:54.008
and I'm sent to Vietnam...

04:54.260 --> 04:57.887
to fight the French.

05:00.182 --> 05:04.477
How'll the Vietnamese react to this

05:05.187 --> 05:06.980
plaque that says "Our Land Our People"

05:07.439 --> 05:09.274
- Someone come!
- Yes, your Excellency!

05:09.525 --> 05:11.651
- Take it down! - Yes!

05:11.902 --> 05:14.028
- Quick! - Wait a minute!

05:15.572 --> 05:19.242
Excellency, the Govt.
changes its policies often...

05:19.535 --> 05:21.411
You could be called back soon.

05:24.248 --> 05:26.165
The Govt's factionalised,

05:26.417 --> 05:28.543
and has cut my forces.

05:29.253 --> 05:30.795
I think that whilst I'm gone...

05:31.130 --> 05:33.339
the men that remain here

05:33.590 --> 05:35.049
will be dismissed.

05:35.968 --> 05:39.721
You're the chief trainer of my Black Flag Army.

05:40.139 --> 05:43.391
I hope you'll organize them into a local militia.

05:43.684 --> 05:47.145
So when China is under foreign attack,

05:47.396 --> 05:49.522
they can defend it.

05:50.649 --> 05:52.483
Master Wong...

05:53.861 --> 05:55.320
Rise!

05:56.530 --> 06:00.116
Excellency, don't worry!
I hope you'll be back soon.

06:02.244 --> 06:03.286
Wong Fei Hung!

06:03.537 --> 06:04.620
The unequal treaties

06:04.872 --> 06:06.706
are written on this fan.

06:06.957 --> 06:09.000
When you see it, you see me.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.626
When I return,

06:10.878 --> 06:14.213
I hope the treaties will be erased.

08:51.538 --> 08:58.503
Pork buns!

09:31.787 --> 09:39.460
Halleluja!

09:42.256 --> 09:44.632
Here it is!

09:50.514 --> 10:28.509
Halleluja!

10:28.760 --> 10:30.303
What are you talking about?

10:35.684 --> 10:38.352
The town's full of foreigners.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.521
How clever of you

10:40.772 --> 10:42.440
to do business with them.

10:42.691 --> 10:44.400
Couldn't succeed in China,

10:44.651 --> 10:46.193
so went to England.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.987
Take a photo

10:48.238 --> 10:49.363
with Old Chu's bird.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.198
The bird will truly be honoured.

10:51.450 --> 10:54.285
Don't mention it. You take one too!

10:54.536 --> 10:56.495
Thank you very much.

10:56.913 --> 10:58.873
Master Wong!

10:59.124 --> 11:01.584
How are you, everyone?

11:02.294 --> 11:03.336
Fei Hung!

11:03.337 --> 11:05.129
Grand uncle, long time no see. You look great.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.757
Thank you! Fei Hung,

11:08.008 --> 11:09.884
see who's with me?

11:10.510 --> 11:15.181
Master Wong! Had tea? Many are expecting you.

11:18.435 --> 11:20.936
- Aunt 13? - Fei Hung!

11:23.023 --> 11:24.148
She wants to shake your hand.

11:24.399 --> 11:25.858
Foreigners shake hands.

11:26.777 --> 11:28.569
Let me introduce you. This is Joanna.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.862
How do you do?

11:30.113 --> 11:31.113
What do...

11:31.490 --> 11:33.032
She's asking: How do you do?

11:33.283 --> 11:35.034
Say thank you ah. Thank you!

11:35.494 --> 11:38.412
Oh, kill you. You're welcome!

11:38.664 --> 11:40.623
Fei Hung, take a photo with the bird.

11:40.874 --> 11:41.957
Okay!

11:44.127 --> 11:45.503
Sit...

11:45.879 --> 11:47.713
Fei Hung, taking photos is easy.

11:47.964 --> 11:49.215
How?

11:49.216 --> 11:50.466
Look there.

11:50.926 --> 11:55.388
Don't move... Or the photo with be no good.

11:57.474 --> 12:01.310
Ready, 1 , 2, 3!

12:03.814 --> 12:06.107
What happened?

12:10.654 --> 12:11.654
It's boiling water!

12:12.989 --> 12:15.741
- How are you? Are you hurt?
- I'm alright!

12:16.118 --> 12:17.702
This foreigner's game is too dangerous.

12:17.953 --> 12:19.161
Too much powder.

12:19.871 --> 12:20.996
You told me not to move!

12:20.997 --> 12:21.997
Are you alright?

12:24.209 --> 12:25.960
Grand Uncle, I'm glad you asked me to come...

12:26.211 --> 12:28.504
or you could've ended up like the bird.

12:28.755 --> 12:30.131
That's right.

12:30.716 --> 12:36.178
Old Chu! ...

12:37.723 --> 12:38.931
I'll go back to England in a few days.

12:39.307 --> 12:41.600
Yee was in England...

12:42.060 --> 12:43.728
but insisted on coming back.

12:44.062 --> 12:46.731
At least she won't mix with those foreigners.

12:48.066 --> 12:51.235
- Please watch over her for me.
- Watch over her?

12:59.202 --> 13:02.913
Old Chu, answer me, you're frightening me.

13:04.124 --> 13:09.044
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

13:15.969 --> 13:17.386
Anyone here?

13:19.848 --> 13:24.351
I'm looking for Master Wong.

13:29.483 --> 13:35.654
Who is it? What's up?

13:35.906 --> 13:38.115
- I'm from May County.
- M...ay...May...May.

13:38.366 --> 13:41.702
I'm Leung Foon. I want Master Wong to teach me.

13:42.287 --> 13:44.455
- He... - He's not here?

13:44.706 --> 13:47.750
- I... I am... - You? You are?

13:48.084 --> 13:50.753
- Wong...Master Wong...
- You're Master Wong?

13:51.004 --> 13:55.925
- No...yes! - Ah, so you are Master Wong?

13:56.468 --> 13:58.302
I'm a herdeman. I practiced Kung Fu with my cow.

13:58.553 --> 14:01.055
The cow kicked me. Please look at my arm.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.142
Good!

14:06.728 --> 14:08.395
Not this one. This one.

14:10.982 --> 14:13.567
Master Wong. I hurt my arm...

14:13.819 --> 14:16.028
Why you wrapped my leg?

14:16.530 --> 14:22.701
Oh...too...late...now!

14:25.330 --> 14:27.623
It's stiff, Master. Why's it stiff?

14:27.874 --> 14:33.921
Are you...alright?

14:36.383 --> 14:37.967
Master, perhaps you want

14:38.218 --> 14:39.468
to teach me Kung Fu?

14:39.719 --> 14:40.803
No...

14:41.054 --> 14:44.139
No? Not good enough?

14:47.018 --> 14:49.228
OK? I'll do my best. Can attack. Can defend.

14:49.479 --> 14:51.146
Not a bad stand.

14:52.315 --> 14:53.274
Stupid!

14:53.525 --> 14:57.611
Still not good? I get it!

14:57.863 --> 14:59.446
I'll roll a few more for you.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.666
What's this noise?

15:11.751 --> 15:14.378
- Who is he? - Master is teaching me Kung Fu!

15:15.171 --> 15:16.714
Buck Teeth So is teaching you Kung Fu?

15:17.549 --> 15:19.550
- Who are you? - Buck Teeth So!

15:20.093 --> 15:22.553
- You are not Master Wong? - Stupid!

15:23.305 --> 15:27.308
Buck Teeth So, who're you?

15:27.642 --> 15:28.976
He is Master Wong's disciple.

15:29.227 --> 15:30.269
And who are you?

15:30.520 --> 15:32.313
I'm also Master Wong's disciple,

15:32.564 --> 15:33.731
Kai what happened to your arm and leg?

15:33.732 --> 15:36.191
Don't ask. I have to get back to the Theater.

15:36.443 --> 15:37.902
I'm going.

15:41.406 --> 15:43.699
Have to go before he binds my other side.

15:50.999 --> 15:57.588
Foon, have you finished mending
the hole on the roof?

15:57.839 --> 15:59.131
The show will start soon!

15:59.382 --> 16:03.260
I'm here to act, and you make me fix the roof.

16:03.511 --> 16:05.346
It's not right and I'm scared.

16:05.597 --> 16:08.766
If you don't do it how do I know you can act?

16:09.017 --> 16:10.225
When I'm famous,

16:10.477 --> 16:12.603
I'll make you do it everyday.

16:26.493 --> 16:28.869
What're you doing? A somersault?

16:29.996 --> 16:32.206
What're you doing?

16:32.707 --> 16:35.000
I thought it was the ship's cannon.

16:35.710 --> 16:36.961
It was only thunder.

16:37.212 --> 16:38.837
If it's true,

16:39.297 --> 16:41.256
we'll all go and work at gold mines in America.

16:41.508 --> 16:45.552
We don't have to toil here.

16:45.804 --> 16:48.681
Don't move! Or you'll spoil it.

16:48.932 --> 16:50.224
Are you ready?

16:51.434 --> 16:53.268
Foreign woman speaking Chinese?

16:56.648 --> 16:58.732
China will be occupied by foreigners soon.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.156
Wait for me!

17:06.407 --> 17:09.410
- 1, 2. - Wait for me!

17:17.002 --> 17:18.502
Wait for you?

17:42.819 --> 17:44.737
It's stuck!

17:45.238 --> 17:48.073
Foon, where the hell are you?

17:48.324 --> 17:49.867
I'm changing!

17:50.118 --> 17:52.745
Come out quick, don't be lazy!

17:53.204 --> 17:56.123
Foon, you brag about your Kung Fu skills.

17:56.374 --> 17:58.208
All you can do is climb roofs and fix things.

17:59.878 --> 18:01.879
Broke the stage with a somersault.

18:02.589 --> 18:05.799
Can you do it?

18:08.970 --> 18:10.179
Miss, the clothes that got dirty...

18:10.430 --> 18:11.430
have been washed.

18:11.681 --> 18:12.723
I asked someone to iron them.

18:12.974 --> 18:14.516
Thank you, Boss!

18:14.934 --> 18:18.145
Do you need fresh water?

18:18.438 --> 18:21.565
No, I'm fine.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.429
Who's it?

18:54.307 --> 18:55.557
You didn't...

19:03.900 --> 19:06.110
I'll invite you to our next new show.

19:06.361 --> 19:07.319
Good, Boss!

19:07.320 --> 19:09.822
- Take care, the road is slippery! - Bye!

19:10.573 --> 19:13.075
A Chinese pretending to be a foreigner!

19:55.493 --> 20:00.956
Miss, umbrella!

20:08.715 --> 20:11.466
Sir, no need to rush.

20:11.718 --> 20:14.386
Come up, there are lots of girls here.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.822
It takes so long.

21:17.408 --> 21:18.533
Don't move!

21:21.871 --> 21:28.293
A gunshot, what's the matter? Who's it?

21:31.506 --> 21:35.550
Master! Master!

21:40.723 --> 21:44.351
- Master! - It's Wing. Open the door.

21:45.895 --> 21:47.479
Master! Master!

21:53.736 --> 21:56.238
You opened the door just in time,
or I'd have to break it.

21:56.489 --> 21:57.781
We'll have tea sometime, my treat.

21:58.741 --> 21:59.741
Excuse me!

22:02.495 --> 22:04.913
- Kai, who's been shot?
- It's the greengrocer.

22:05.164 --> 22:06.331
Who shot him?

22:06.332 --> 22:07.874
I don't know. Ask Master.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.256
Buck Teeth So,
if not for me you'd break something.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.258
Por...ky...Porky...

22:16.509 --> 22:19.636
My name's Wing. Call me Porky and I'll get fat.

22:19.887 --> 22:21.805
Back for so long and still don't speak Chinese.

22:22.056 --> 22:26.810
- Por...ky... - Bu...ck...Tee..th.

22:27.061 --> 22:28.437
So, get me the medicine.

22:28.730 --> 22:30.647
You don't speak Chinese,
how can you handle medicine?

22:30.898 --> 22:32.232
What are you quarrelling about?

22:32.483 --> 22:35.402
Master, I'm teaching him how to be Chinese.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.446
- Give me "The Magic Healer".
- "The Magic Healer".

22:37.697 --> 22:40.615
3, they're all 3 characters.

22:41.117 --> 22:43.368
Master, I can't read!

22:44.203 --> 22:46.163
You laugh at those who don't speak Chinese?

22:46.914 --> 22:48.915
Come, So.

22:50.168 --> 22:54.671
"Powder for 7 Cuts", "Blood-Clotting Powder".

22:55.173 --> 22:57.758
So is from America.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.009
Studied medicine there

22:59.260 --> 23:01.511
learns bonesetting here.

23:01.971 --> 23:03.638
Then he's quite good.

23:04.932 --> 23:06.391
Master, here's the water.

23:06.768 --> 23:08.060
Finally.

23:09.645 --> 23:11.897
Take a rest, you'll be fine.

23:12.148 --> 23:13.732
Master, this is a bullet from a shotgun.

23:13.983 --> 23:15.275
Let's bandage him first.

23:16.527 --> 23:17.736
Many ships,

23:17.987 --> 23:18.945
and too many colours in the flags.

23:19.197 --> 23:21.114
So he boarded...

23:22.492 --> 23:24.868
the wrong ship and got shot.

23:25.453 --> 23:27.037
The "Westernization Movement" is now underway.

23:27.330 --> 23:29.873
When there's trouble, we Chinese suffer.

23:31.918 --> 23:35.128
Can we Chinese survive?

23:36.047 --> 23:38.632
The Manchurians have taken our land.

23:38.883 --> 23:42.135
Now they join the foreigners
and sell out our country.

23:44.430 --> 23:46.640
Brothers of the Local Militia, let's act!

23:49.644 --> 23:52.604
- Ca...ca...calm down!
- You lecturing me?

23:52.855 --> 23:53.814
Por...ky...

23:54.065 --> 23:55.774
Watch your tongue, can me Big Brother.

23:56.025 --> 23:58.193
- Wing! - Master!

23:59.654 --> 24:02.781
You're too rash. Keep out of this.

24:04.826 --> 24:06.243
This is a matter of life or death.

24:06.953 --> 24:08.161
I must sort this out

24:08.496 --> 24:10.247
with the authorities.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.875
Otherwise how can we Chinese

24:14.168 --> 24:15.752
live here anymore?

24:35.523 --> 24:38.024
Excuse me sir, you would like something?

24:38.359 --> 24:43.280
- So, you explain it to the captain. - Yes!

24:44.740 --> 24:47.325
Excuse me, Mr. Jackson
of Sino Pacific Corporation...

24:47.577 --> 24:49.661
and General Wickens of the British Forces

24:49.912 --> 24:51.788
have made an appointment with us.

24:52.039 --> 24:53.915
And I presume they should have
reserved a table for this matter.

24:54.167 --> 24:56.376
So we can discuss this matter more leisurely.

24:57.420 --> 24:59.629
This is my master, Wong Fei Hung.

24:59.881 --> 25:02.048
We'd be gratefull if you'd show us the table.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.427
How...come...your...English...is...so...fluent?

25:05.678 --> 25:07.012
This way please.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.104
Why so many swords and daggers on the table?

25:16.647 --> 25:21.318
Excuse me sir, your menu, sir.

25:27.575 --> 25:30.785
So, ask them to bring us some dim sum.

25:39.212 --> 25:45.175
Foon, your job is to check tickets today.

25:45.426 --> 25:46.760
I'm here to learn acting not check tickets,

25:47.011 --> 25:48.303
doesn't sound right.

25:48.554 --> 25:49.679
Can't help it.

25:49.931 --> 25:52.098
All the others have gone to America.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.809
America? Gold mining?

25:55.061 --> 25:57.062
Boss, is there really gold there?

25:58.105 --> 25:59.189
Would I lie to you?

25:59.440 --> 26:00.982
It's all the newspaper.

26:01.234 --> 26:03.944
I'd go too if I didn't have to run this place.

26:04.987 --> 26:07.781
Newspaper? What newspaper?

26:08.366 --> 26:10.408
They're here for protection money.

26:11.035 --> 26:12.035
You haven't paid?

26:12.286 --> 26:15.747
Yes I have, but these thugs are from Shaho.

26:16.290 --> 26:19.292
How dare they venture out of their patch?

26:19.544 --> 26:21.253
If I deal with them, they've had it!

26:21.671 --> 26:22.671
Yes!

26:22.922 --> 26:24.089
What are you doing?

26:24.090 --> 26:25.215
I know you know wome Kung Fu.

26:25.466 --> 26:27.801
Didn't you say you want to make it big?

26:28.052 --> 26:30.136
Here's your chance.

26:30.388 --> 26:32.013
I didn't mean that.

26:32.306 --> 26:34.349
Boss, I'm not good at Kung Fu.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.226
They've all come here just to honour you.

26:37.687 --> 26:39.479
I'm being set up. Stop!

26:40.231 --> 26:44.276
Boss, open the gate! Boss, open up. Quick!

26:44.527 --> 26:46.945
No daytime show. No ticket.

26:47.238 --> 26:49.030
I'll come another time.

26:49.282 --> 26:52.909
Hey kid, come down!

26:53.744 --> 26:55.579
Damn. I came a long way, and there's no show.

26:55.830 --> 26:57.497
Next time I won't bother.

27:00.626 --> 27:04.588
I know you're Foon. Here to talk with me?

27:04.839 --> 27:06.006
No, I'm here to check tickets.

27:06.257 --> 27:07.507
We're here to collect protection money.

27:07.967 --> 27:10.468
They said you're a good fighter.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.429
You're brave... facing us alone.

27:12.680 --> 27:13.805
You've got guts!

27:14.056 --> 27:16.683
You're kidding.

27:16.934 --> 27:18.602
Let me buy you a gift.

27:18.853 --> 27:20.186
I'll visit you guys in a minute.

27:21.731 --> 27:23.690
No need.

27:24.609 --> 27:26.026
No need for gifts,

27:26.277 --> 27:30.447
just a hand will do.

27:30.698 --> 27:33.491
Chop my hand off? Chop your mother's head off!

27:34.869 --> 27:38.288
Don't go.

27:40.041 --> 27:42.417
Okay, it's too many against one.

27:43.336 --> 27:46.630
Let's fix a time and place for a duel.

27:46.881 --> 27:49.466
Don't bother, let's do it right here and now.

27:58.768 --> 28:02.103
Get him! Stop!

28:08.986 --> 28:10.820
Someone's fighting in the Theater.

28:11.155 --> 28:14.199
Yes, with knives!

28:14.909 --> 28:17.077
Don't run! Stop! Stop! Get him!

28:17.370 --> 28:18.453
Excuse us, excuse us!

28:18.704 --> 28:19.621
- What's happening? - Fighting!

28:19.622 --> 28:20.664
Fight out there,

28:20.915 --> 28:23.208
we're doing business here. Out! Out!

28:26.420 --> 28:27.879
What is it, pal?

28:28.130 --> 28:30.715
They demand protection money,
and want to challenge me...

28:30.966 --> 28:32.217
But they're too many against one.

28:32.468 --> 28:34.469
kill that dumb fool!

28:37.098 --> 28:39.224
- Armageddon over there. Go and look!
- Where?

28:47.066 --> 28:50.944
That's Porky, Wong's disciple.

28:51.529 --> 28:52.904
Never met him.

28:53.739 --> 28:56.241
Porky, for your master's sake...

28:56.492 --> 28:59.452
I'll let you go today.

29:00.329 --> 29:01.454
So you're Master Wong's disciple?

29:01.706 --> 29:02.872
I am!

29:02.873 --> 29:05.375
I saw the junior doctor at Po Chi Lam.

29:05.626 --> 29:06.668
That Chinese American.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.461
- Foon! - What?

29:08.879 --> 29:10.463
I'm not kidding,

29:11.006 --> 29:12.841
if you don't bring a hand to Shaho...

29:13.092 --> 29:14.759
I'll make you disappear from Fa Shan.

29:15.177 --> 29:17.804
- Let's to Shaho. - Go!

29:18.055 --> 29:20.473
Chicken out because Wong's disciple is here?

29:21.142 --> 29:23.685
You want a hand? Take this hock!

29:27.440 --> 29:29.566
Big brother, what shall we do?

29:29.942 --> 29:32.068
Do? Let's tear them apart!

29:39.535 --> 29:40.744
Brother Wing. This one's for him!

29:40.995 --> 29:42.579
It's free, I'm not doing business today.

29:45.875 --> 29:47.250
You stinky boy...

30:16.363 --> 30:19.991
Shaho's stupid, Shaho's dumb...

30:31.504 --> 30:33.880
Give me any trouble, I'll beat you to death.

30:44.558 --> 30:48.061
Have some puddings, enjoy the show.

30:48.312 --> 30:49.562
A bean curd pudding.

30:59.156 --> 31:04.327
Take that! Hold it!

31:12.545 --> 31:17.131
Add a little water, make a perfect brew.

31:17.383 --> 31:19.926
Boiling water? Who threw it? Find him.

31:20.177 --> 31:22.220
Go up and see!

31:22.763 --> 31:26.516
- Who dropped boiling water? Out! - Go!

31:26.767 --> 31:28.101
Old Fool, it must be you.

31:28.352 --> 31:29.769
Not me. I've been eating pork buns.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.312
Pork buns?

31:41.365 --> 31:44.909
And that, Your Excellency,
is the position of Her Majesty's Government.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.120
May I suggest that we leave it at that?

31:47.621 --> 31:49.873
Your Government is most generous

31:50.749 --> 31:51.749
Wong Fei Hung!

31:52.376 --> 31:54.752
This is General Wickens of the British forces.

31:55.045 --> 31:56.880
Mr. Jackson of the Sino Pacific Corporation.

31:57.423 --> 31:59.632
They've kindly agreed not to press charges.

31:59.967 --> 32:02.552
So stop making demands for the greengrocer.

32:02.970 --> 32:05.221
This is unjust. The people are outraged.

32:05.472 --> 32:07.348
Outraged? Wong,

32:07.975 --> 32:09.851
you have no authority.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.936
You are just a civilian.

32:12.187 --> 32:14.480
Who are you to negotiate?

32:14.732 --> 32:16.357
The Westernization Movements is on

32:16.609 --> 32:18.067
relationships with foreigners...

32:18.319 --> 32:22.322
It's better to keep the peace.

32:22.948 --> 32:27.243
These rolls are made from our flour.

32:28.746 --> 32:31.080
So you appreciate western food?

32:31.832 --> 32:34.584
The foreigners draw boundaries here...

32:34.835 --> 32:36.878
and set up forbidden areas.

32:37.671 --> 32:39.422
If we fight each other...

32:39.673 --> 32:41.174
and defer to them,

32:41.425 --> 32:44.636
then soon we'll lose the flour to make rolls.

32:45.095 --> 32:47.889
You're friends with Lau

32:48.140 --> 32:49.599
of the Black Flag Army.

32:49.850 --> 32:51.309
But he doesn't follow orders

32:51.560 --> 32:53.436
from Central Govt.

32:53.729 --> 32:56.272
I'm sent here to watch you.

32:56.523 --> 32:57.941
I intend to set an example.

33:09.536 --> 33:10.787
Are you alright?

33:17.920 --> 33:19.003
What is all this?

33:24.885 --> 33:26.803
Master, it's our Local Militia.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.557
Master Wong!

33:32.017 --> 33:32.976
Stop them!

33:34.895 --> 33:36.688
Stop.

33:38.774 --> 33:39.857
Don't fight!

33:40.693 --> 33:43.152
Kai, I told you to tell them not to fight!

33:45.864 --> 33:47.824
Told you not to fight!

33:50.119 --> 33:53.621
Put down the weapons! Still fighting?

33:58.460 --> 33:59.419
Don't move.

34:00.337 --> 34:01.838
I expect you'd have an explanation

34:02.089 --> 34:03.506
for this disgraceful intrusion.

34:03.757 --> 34:04.799
Good day!

34:06.635 --> 34:07.760
General Wickens.

34:19.148 --> 34:21.024
- You're quite good! - Of course!

34:24.820 --> 34:26.446
Big Brother, that looks like Master Wong.

34:26.697 --> 34:27.989
Master Wong.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.116
We are many, let's take him on!

34:34.288 --> 34:40.001
Don't fight!

34:43.547 --> 34:46.591
He hit you? Don't fight!

34:47.342 --> 34:48.384
Don't fight, Kai!

34:48.802 --> 34:53.097
- Don't fight... - I told you not to fight!

34:53.514 --> 34:56.225
- I said don't fight!
- You're still fighting?

34:56.476 --> 34:59.520
Really stop? They're coming. Let me go!

35:06.904 --> 35:08.196
Big Brother, are you alright?

35:08.822 --> 35:11.115
- Who just kicked me? - Don't know!

35:12.951 --> 35:14.827
- Have you taken them on? - Yes, we have!

35:15.079 --> 35:16.245
Carry on!

35:23.128 --> 35:24.629
- Buck Teeth So! - Stupid!

35:28.550 --> 35:29.509
I'm so sorry!

35:40.979 --> 35:42.063
So, tell them

35:42.314 --> 35:43.397
they've made a mistake.

35:43.649 --> 35:45.024
- Mr. Jackson! - No need to explain.

35:46.944 --> 35:48.236
If China had no forbidden areas,

35:48.487 --> 35:49.529
we'd be unsafe.

35:49.780 --> 35:50.738
Master, this alien can speak Chinese.

35:53.408 --> 35:54.575
Still attacking?

35:57.454 --> 35:59.288
Don't call me a alien "Chinese Devil"!

35:59.748 --> 36:01.916
You listen, we're doing business with you.

36:02.167 --> 36:04.544
If we don't use our heads,
how do we make big money?

36:04.962 --> 36:09.090
Otherwise you'll get yourself...

36:09.383 --> 36:12.009
in big trouble.

36:14.680 --> 36:18.975
Goodby Chinamen! Let's go!

36:21.770 --> 36:24.355
- Shoot whoever resists. - Run! Run!

36:28.026 --> 36:29.193
The authorities are here!

36:29.194 --> 36:31.904
Let's get outta here!

36:34.616 --> 36:35.867
Stop! Don't move!

36:36.118 --> 36:38.786
Drop your weapons.
Why're the Local Militia fighting?

36:39.621 --> 36:41.581
Where's Porky? Gone?

36:44.960 --> 36:46.544
Don't move, or else we'll shoot.

36:48.255 --> 36:50.715
Wong, this area's rented by the foreigners...

36:50.966 --> 36:52.550
The Local Militia make trouble here.

36:52.801 --> 36:53.968
You're the Head,

36:54.219 --> 36:55.511
how do you explain it?

36:55.846 --> 36:58.806
Excellency,

36:59.057 --> 37:00.641
they were Govt. trained.

37:00.893 --> 37:02.018
So they would not act without a reason.

37:02.269 --> 37:04.896
Reason? What the Govt. discards, you retain.

37:05.147 --> 37:06.939
The Local Militia is directly
under us from now on.

37:07.191 --> 37:08.441
Excellency...

37:09.234 --> 37:10.484
Tell them report to City Hall!

37:10.736 --> 37:12.737
- Or get arrested. - Excellency...

37:12.988 --> 37:15.364
Master Wong will pay for all the damages.

37:15.616 --> 37:17.074
Yes, Your Excellency!

37:29.004 --> 37:44.518
Beware of fire. Beware of thieves.

37:44.770 --> 37:46.229
Master, I've lost my appetite.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.023
I hear this was started by a gang from Shaho.

37:49.274 --> 37:50.858
City Hall now requires us to report in.

37:51.151 --> 37:53.236
Will they hold us in custody?

37:54.112 --> 37:55.488
Master!

37:57.950 --> 38:04.288
Sit! City Hall's authorized to look into this.

38:04.581 --> 38:05.665
If it's a set-up,

38:05.666 --> 38:06.624
they'll find out the truth.

38:07.000 --> 38:07.833
So, let's eat...

38:07.834 --> 38:09.168
Until the verdict is know,

38:09.962 --> 38:12.046
this'll be our last meal together.

38:13.548 --> 38:14.590
Let's eat.

38:36.238 --> 38:38.781
Listen, "Local Militia", prepare to eat.

38:39.491 --> 38:55.172
Pick up vegetables! Eat rice! Swallow!

39:13.984 --> 39:15.234
Aunt 13!

39:15.986 --> 39:17.069
Don't worry,

39:17.321 --> 39:18.988
the Local Militia will be fine.

39:23.076 --> 39:24.994
It's late, why don't you sleep?

39:25.287 --> 39:27.330
I want to take your measurements for a suit.

39:29.458 --> 39:30.583
A suit?

39:30.834 --> 39:31.876
Why would I want to wear a western suit?

39:32.336 --> 39:34.628
It's for when you go abroad.

39:38.342 --> 39:41.344
Aunt 13, is the West so wonderful?

39:42.512 --> 39:45.973
Why do we have to learn from the West?

39:47.351 --> 39:49.352
They invented things like the steam engine
and many other things.

39:49.603 --> 39:50.895
Their science is developed far beyond us.

39:51.146 --> 39:52.605
If we don't learn we'll get left behind.

39:57.569 --> 39:59.403
When you get the chance, tell me more...

39:59.780 --> 40:01.739
about how great the outside world is.

40:17.881 --> 40:23.511
Aunt 13, if it's so great,

40:23.929 --> 40:25.596
why'd you come back?

40:29.017 --> 40:31.268
There's something here they haven't got.

40:31.812 --> 40:33.104
What haven't they got?

40:35.607 --> 40:36.941
People!

40:45.742 --> 40:47.993
People I want to see

40:49.496 --> 40:52.373
I was away 2 years,

40:52.749 --> 40:54.208
but my heart was here.

40:54.584 --> 40:57.378
In fact you were always in my thoughts

40:58.839 --> 41:00.381
You are very sweet.

41:03.385 --> 41:05.386
- Aunt 13! - What's wrong?

41:05.637 --> 41:07.638
I thought...No, it's nothing!

41:08.223 --> 41:10.891
Fei Hung, you and I are relatives by name,

41:11.309 --> 41:12.643
not by blood.

41:12.894 --> 41:14.103
We were raised together,

41:14.354 --> 41:16.355
don't call me Aunt 13.

41:17.774 --> 41:19.400
What'll I call you? You're senior to me.

41:19.651 --> 41:20.985
I'll do it!

41:28.452 --> 41:31.328
What's this? Doesn't matter!

41:32.164 --> 41:33.581
Doesn't matter?

41:33.874 --> 41:37.084
Of course it does, one must be precise.

41:37.335 --> 41:39.837
Chinese shouldn't wear suits.

41:40.088 --> 41:41.088
Chinese are Chinese,

41:41.339 --> 41:42.715
Westerners Western.

41:44.009 --> 41:46.510
There will be railways
and a telegraph company soon.

41:46.761 --> 41:48.012
Everything will change.

41:48.263 --> 41:50.973
China will change will the world.

41:55.353 --> 41:56.687
You're right.

41:57.481 --> 41:59.857
Western guns and ships are here.

42:00.108 --> 42:01.734
Everything is changing.

42:02.444 --> 42:04.528
Changing. What will we change into?

42:05.447 --> 42:08.491
I appreciate your gift, but you keep it.

42:09.659 --> 42:11.744
When all Chinese wear suits,

42:12.287 --> 42:13.454
I'll wear one.

42:41.024 --> 42:45.528
Come greet me the God of Fortune!
Here I am, the God of Fortune!

42:46.404 --> 42:47.821
Get away! Get away, Jesuit!

42:48.823 --> 42:50.449
Fortune?

42:50.992 --> 42:54.286
Sir, we already bought the God of Fortune.

42:54.538 --> 42:55.704
Come greet the God of Fortune!

42:55.705 --> 42:59.250
Sir, we already bought the God of Fortune!

43:00.502 --> 43:04.129
Did you buy Fortune from me, or the old one?

43:04.464 --> 43:08.008
He's now dead in a well. Want to see him?

43:08.927 --> 43:10.302
Just buy a new one!

43:10.554 --> 43:11.637
If I pay him, what happens

43:11.638 --> 43:13.138
when the old God comes?

43:13.390 --> 43:16.225
- Sir, do you need a hand?
- You want to join us!

43:17.352 --> 43:19.270
- Yes sir! Life is so tough right now!
- Give me the money.

43:19.521 --> 43:21.313
So that we can take care of you.

43:21.565 --> 43:22.898
Sir, don't clean me out,

43:23.149 --> 43:24.275
give me a chance.

43:24.526 --> 43:27.111
- And who'll give me a chance?
- Give me of it!

43:28.863 --> 43:30.406
Take advantage of people in these hard times?

43:33.118 --> 43:34.451
It's Master Wong!

43:34.703 --> 43:36.412
You're from Shaho?

43:36.913 --> 43:38.038
Come with me to City Hall.

43:38.290 --> 43:39.248
Protect me!

43:58.685 --> 43:59.810
Stabbing your own people?

44:09.195 --> 44:11.822
Get going! Run!

44:16.703 --> 44:17.661
Quick! Get away, quick!

44:17.912 --> 44:19.872
Run! Where've you good-for-nothings gone?

44:35.096 --> 44:36.096
Go to hell!

44:45.607 --> 44:48.525
Damn, it's high!

44:56.201 --> 44:57.034
Run

44:57.035 --> 44:58.786
Alright! How wonderful!

44:59.037 --> 45:00.037
Did you see Master Wong do his

45:00.288 --> 45:01.413
"Shadowless Kick"?

45:01.414 --> 45:02.915
- Did you see it? - No, I didn't.

45:03.166 --> 45:07.544
Everyone, this guy extorts money.

45:07.796 --> 45:09.213
I'm taking him to City Hall.

45:09.547 --> 45:11.465
Please come and be witness.

45:13.802 --> 45:15.260
He's impressive,

45:15.553 --> 45:17.096
did an amazing jump.

45:17.347 --> 45:19.973
Boss, he wants protection money from you.

45:20.308 --> 45:22.309
Come with me to be a witness.

45:22.560 --> 45:23.936
Witness?

45:25.188 --> 45:26.397
And live my days worrying

45:26.648 --> 45:27.940
like the Theater boss?

45:28.191 --> 45:29.566
You were practising Kung Fu in there,

45:29.818 --> 45:33.153
I saw no fighting.

45:34.698 --> 45:38.325
In America, people have to walk carefully.

45:39.577 --> 45:42.913
Because they can trip on gold.

45:43.164 --> 45:45.499
- How's that possible? - There's more.

45:45.750 --> 45:48.961
Wash your face in the river, you'll find gold.

45:49.212 --> 45:50.254
Is it really so wonderful?

45:50.505 --> 45:51.755
Of course it is!

45:52.006 --> 45:53.090
Just one visit's

45:53.341 --> 45:55.926
worth a lifetime of work in China.

45:58.638 --> 46:00.639
Come, have some leaflets, one for everyone.

46:00.974 --> 46:02.015
Don't said I didn't inform you

46:02.267 --> 46:04.226
People there wear dark glasses day and night.

46:05.019 --> 46:06.103
your eyes will get hurt

46:06.354 --> 46:07.396
You can't pick up gold

46:07.647 --> 46:09.732
if you're blind.

46:13.278 --> 46:17.364
Lost sheep, God's Kingdom belongs to you.

46:19.409 --> 46:20.701
You're promoting America too?

46:20.994 --> 46:22.578
Material things are transient.

46:22.829 --> 46:26.290
Only Jesus is the truth.

46:26.541 --> 46:29.626
You should follow him and experience life.

46:30.378 --> 46:31.795
I arrested a criminal today,

46:32.297 --> 46:34.173
will Jesus be my witness?

47:00.909 --> 47:06.914
Beware of me. Beware of thieves.

47:10.210 --> 47:12.336
Big Brother!

47:12.587 --> 47:14.546
- Big Brother, are you over there?
- I'm here!

47:18.301 --> 47:19.510
Get ready!

47:35.610 --> 47:38.320
- Master! - How are you?

47:38.571 --> 47:40.531
You crazy? Fanning when it's so windy outside.

47:40.990 --> 47:42.658
City Hall locked up the Local Militia?

47:43.326 --> 47:45.369
Won't release them till the suspect's caught.

47:46.788 --> 47:47.746
Master!

47:49.791 --> 47:50.999
I can't be a witness

47:51.251 --> 47:52.501
because I'm a suspect.

47:53.586 --> 47:55.754
They even let Hung of Shaho go.

47:58.716 --> 48:00.717
When will the Local Militia be released?

48:01.469 --> 48:03.053
When someone offers to be a witness.

48:08.351 --> 48:10.269
Master, how about Foon?

48:10.895 --> 48:13.647
- Foon? Do you know him? - Yes.

48:14.941 --> 48:16.149
You must be in this.

48:16.651 --> 48:17.860
What's you hiding?

48:18.111 --> 48:23.866
I...Master, you don't always trust me.

48:24.117 --> 48:25.993
So, I...

48:26.244 --> 48:27.786
I what? Speak!

48:28.037 --> 48:31.456
Mas...Mas...Master...The...There...

48:43.678 --> 48:45.554
- Fire! - Calm down, So. Don't panic!

48:45.805 --> 48:47.264
Master!

48:48.600 --> 48:49.975
So! ...

48:55.231 --> 48:56.189
Master, what shall we do?

48:56.441 --> 48:57.608
The arrows came from the pharmacy's roof.

48:57.859 --> 48:59.234
So, Master is coming to save you!

49:00.111 --> 49:02.571
Never mind me. Gather...the valuables!

49:02.947 --> 49:07.576
Kai, get your weapon. We'll take them on.

49:07.911 --> 49:10.662
Wing, put out the fire. I'm off.

49:10.914 --> 49:12.164
Alone?

49:22.091 --> 49:23.133
Damn!

49:23.384 --> 49:25.052
So! Here!

49:34.187 --> 49:35.687
Goddamn steps!

49:37.607 --> 49:41.151
His Excellency's fan? It is!

49:51.496 --> 49:53.580
Wow, the rooftop fire is big!

49:54.248 --> 49:55.958
It's...even big...bigger down here!

50:01.589 --> 50:03.423
- Someone's on the roof. - Shoot him!

50:11.933 --> 50:13.642
It's Master Wong. Go! Run!

50:31.869 --> 50:33.370
Po Chi Lam is on fire!

50:36.749 --> 50:39.418
Don't forget the camera, hurry up!

50:43.423 --> 50:44.881
Po Chi Lam will be no more if it's burnt.

50:50.054 --> 50:51.054
What are you doing, Aunt 13?

50:51.305 --> 50:52.347
Taking a photo of Po Chi Lam.

50:52.598 --> 50:53.932
A photo! Your butt is on fire.

50:54.183 --> 50:55.350
You're blocking the sign.

50:55.601 --> 50:59.021
A little more, I can't see you.

50:59.272 --> 51:00.397
Should we wait for Master?

51:00.648 --> 51:04.026
The...roof...is...is on fire!

51:05.945 --> 51:08.363
So, look this way!

51:11.659 --> 51:14.161
Kai, shift a little to the right.

51:59.832 --> 52:01.583
I thought I had it with me.

52:02.293 --> 52:05.170
But I was taking pictures of Po Chi Lam.

52:06.380 --> 52:09.382
You're just like a foreign hag...

52:09.759 --> 52:11.510
caring only for trivia.

52:12.053 --> 52:14.137
Don't ever bring this into the Clinic again.

52:15.139 --> 52:18.308
Or I'll throw it away.

52:31.239 --> 52:33.323
His Excellency the Governor is here!

52:43.626 --> 52:45.585
Wong Fei Hung, you open Schools,

52:45.837 --> 52:47.671
triad societies...

52:47.922 --> 52:51.758
divide up the town and run illegal business.
You did't obey the law.

52:52.009 --> 52:53.510
Now other triads take revenge...

52:54.178 --> 52:56.805
The burning of Po Chi Lam is your own fault.

52:57.056 --> 52:59.182
It's time to mend your ways!

52:59.809 --> 53:03.395
Excellency, Schools are not triad societies.

53:04.772 --> 53:05.939
If the authority...

53:06.858 --> 53:08.984
labels martial arts illegal,

53:10.570 --> 53:12.028
then our grand tradition...

53:12.280 --> 53:15.365
will be lost.

53:15.700 --> 53:17.325
So when attacked,

53:18.035 --> 53:20.245
how'll we defend ourselves?

53:20.496 --> 53:22.664
Is that what you can courting peace?

53:23.583 --> 53:24.791
Can't save your Po Chi Lam...

53:25.042 --> 53:27.043
and you dare lecturing me!

53:27.420 --> 53:30.922
It's City Hall's job to investigate the fire.

53:31.174 --> 53:33.216
You tell me, who did it?

53:33.968 --> 53:34.926
I don't know.

53:35.178 --> 53:37.637
You don't know? You're covering something.

53:42.727 --> 53:43.727
Big Brother!

53:43.978 --> 53:48.690
Wing, what are you doing? Go in!

53:48.941 --> 53:50.317
Master!

53:52.945 --> 53:54.613
Can I come in?

53:54.864 --> 53:55.989
Foreigners...why you come here?

53:56.240 --> 53:57.908
- Wing! - Master!

53:59.035 --> 54:01.494
Go on like this, and you stop calling me Master.

54:01.746 --> 54:02.787
Don't go.

54:03.164 --> 54:04.623
You must hold something against Fei Hung.

54:04.874 --> 54:07.417
You can tell me.

54:10.421 --> 54:14.341
Wong Fei Hung. I know who set Po Chi Lam on fire.

54:14.759 --> 54:17.344
I can be your witness.

54:17.887 --> 54:19.471
Check if anyone's from Shaho.

54:20.681 --> 54:22.307
- Hey, are you from Shaho. - No!

54:22.558 --> 54:23.808
Not the way you talk.

54:25.645 --> 54:27.062
There's so many people here!

54:27.480 --> 54:31.191
Big Brother, seems City Hall may get you.

54:31.442 --> 54:34.194
Goddamn! That Jesuit must've told on me.

54:34.487 --> 54:36.404
Should you go and hide in Shaho?

54:37.573 --> 54:38.531
No way!

54:38.783 --> 54:40.951
We're afraid of City Hall,
they're afraid of the foreigners.

54:41.202 --> 54:43.119
So let's find us an influential foreigners!

54:45.831 --> 54:47.123
Wait for me.

54:49.835 --> 54:51.711
We want to speak to Mr. Jackson.

54:51.963 --> 54:53.755
Do you understand what I'm saying?

54:54.048 --> 54:56.132
What's going on down there?

54:56.384 --> 54:58.510
Damn, we don't speak English. Try harder.

54:58.761 --> 55:02.722
Please,

55:02.974 --> 55:05.225
please let us in to see Mr. Jackson.

55:05.476 --> 55:07.435
We all want to see Mr. Jackson.

55:07.687 --> 55:12.023
Jackson...

55:12.275 --> 55:15.068
I'd better have a cigar

55:15.319 --> 55:17.612
I don't like cigars.

55:21.075 --> 55:25.120
If I keep a dog, it'll guard my house.

55:25.371 --> 55:27.247
You are wanted by City Hall.

55:27.498 --> 55:29.708
What good is it if I help you?

55:29.959 --> 55:31.960
I'm not afraid of being arrested.

55:32.920 --> 55:35.005
But I am afraid that without a leader,

55:35.256 --> 55:37.674
my brothers' talent will go to waste.

55:37.925 --> 55:40.552
You come all this way to make money,

55:41.137 --> 55:43.346
send so many Chinese to America.

55:43.806 --> 55:46.474
Why don't I give you some women to ship over?

55:46.726 --> 55:47.726
Isn't it a better idea?

55:47.977 --> 55:49.519
No, we don't allow

55:49.770 --> 55:50.729
the labourers to have wives.

55:50.980 --> 55:52.314
Don't allow them to have descendents.

55:52.565 --> 55:54.566
Otherwise they'd stay there forever.

55:55.359 --> 55:58.653
I don't mean wives, but whores.

55:58.904 --> 56:00.655
I have as many as you want.

56:00.906 --> 56:02.324
It's Master Wong,

56:02.742 --> 56:04.784
who always interferes.

56:05.578 --> 56:07.871
Dare you kill him for me?

56:20.718 --> 56:24.346
- Master Wong? - Yes...

56:24.597 --> 56:26.431
- I'll invite him to the show tomorrow.
- Yes, yes, yes!

56:26.682 --> 56:29.017
Then he'll be killed by me...

56:29.268 --> 56:31.853
or the authorities.

56:55.252 --> 56:56.795
Do you hear noise?

57:00.591 --> 57:02.509
Something just dropped into the water.

57:24.990 --> 57:26.533
Wing, City Hall's after the Shaho Gang.

57:26.784 --> 57:28.660
Foon, where were you?

57:28.911 --> 57:31.079
I've to go back to the Theater. Come with me.

57:31.330 --> 57:32.997
Wait, let me lock up first.

57:33.249 --> 57:35.333
OK!

57:36.585 --> 57:38.711
- Hey, come out first. - Oh right!

57:47.805 --> 57:49.222
This is Wing,

57:49.473 --> 57:50.682
the one who can Sove of any problems.

57:50.933 --> 57:52.934
Master Wong's disciple. Welcome!

57:53.394 --> 57:55.145
I won't see the show for free. I'll check tickets.

57:55.396 --> 57:56.563
I like gate duty.

57:56.814 --> 57:58.940
- Thank you indeed.
- Never mind, never mind.

58:26.802 --> 58:28.970
Ticket. Have you got tickets?

58:29.221 --> 58:31.973
Those with tickets, get in.

58:33.434 --> 58:34.684
Do you have tickets?

58:34.935 --> 58:36.686
Ticket?

58:36.937 --> 58:38.855
Do you know who I am? Look at the sign.

58:39.106 --> 58:43.193
He's Wonder Ho, I'm White Gent.

58:43.444 --> 58:45.278
And I'm Wing! No ticket, go!

58:45.529 --> 58:48.531
The show's starting and you tell us to leave?

58:48.782 --> 58:51.993
- OK, we'll go, just don't regret it!
- We'll go! We'll go!

58:52.244 --> 58:54.996
Got tickets?...

58:55.247 --> 58:56.372
Brother Wing, let's go in.

58:56.624 --> 58:57.790
No hurry, the actors aren't there yet.

58:58.042 --> 58:59.542
Thank you so much.

59:01.045 --> 59:03.296
Have you seen Wonder Ho and White Gent?

59:03.547 --> 59:04.964
They tried to barge in,

59:05.216 --> 59:06.216
I turned them away.

59:06.467 --> 59:08.134
What? They're the actors.

59:08.385 --> 59:10.094
Who will act then?

59:10.346 --> 59:11.846
Then we don't have a show.

59:12.097 --> 59:13.097
You stay here.

59:13.098 --> 59:16.059
- I'll go and fetch them. - Tickets...

59:22.233 --> 59:23.942
Master has come, you help me.

59:24.193 --> 59:25.276
I've to go to toilet.

59:25.528 --> 59:27.278
Excuse me.

59:27.530 --> 59:29.280
Mr. Jackson, let me introduce you to
the Reverend Father.

59:29.532 --> 59:30.532
Please to meet you, sir.

59:30.533 --> 59:32.283
General Wickens, please take a seat.

59:33.494 --> 59:35.453
Can't imagine you'd be invited by the foreigners.

59:35.704 --> 59:37.205
Please!

59:42.670 --> 59:46.381
- Aunt 13! - Master Wong!

59:49.260 --> 59:50.677
Why so detached?

59:51.136 --> 59:52.470
Relatives must respect

59:52.721 --> 59:54.556
the rule of seniority.

59:55.975 --> 59:57.267
Alright, let's just watch the show!

59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.438
Please! ...

01:00:05.025 --> 01:00:08.861
Wing, we're in trouble.

01:00:09.113 --> 01:00:10.321
Master's hre. I don't want to watch the show.

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.824
The actors are gone. You're going.

01:00:13.075 --> 01:00:14.158
What'll I do?

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.411
- I can sing. - So what?

01:00:16.662 --> 01:00:18.454
I can act a little. Let's go!

01:00:18.706 --> 01:00:21.291
You dare sing on stage...

01:00:21.542 --> 01:00:23.876
in front of Master?

01:00:24.169 --> 01:00:26.337
Fool, who will recognize us with make up on?

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.215
OK, let's take a chance. Come backstage.

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.051
Lucky you get us

01:00:32.052 --> 01:00:33.011
or the show'd be cancelled.

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.220
Amazing that you could recognize me...

01:00:34.471 --> 01:00:35.680
Isn't that Porky?

01:00:36.015 --> 01:00:38.808
- Who's Wing? Let's go. - Go.

01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:40.935
The White Snake is now a Fat Snake.

01:00:57.995 --> 01:01:01.289
Porky! Porky!

01:01:04.501 --> 01:01:06.628
Hey, Porky's changed profession.

01:01:07.254 --> 01:01:08.880
Hey, where'll we get our pork from now?

01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:11.591
Wing, again!

01:01:23.395 --> 01:01:24.520
Nonsense!

01:01:24.772 --> 01:01:25.813
I got him to do it,

01:01:26.065 --> 01:01:27.190
don't blame him.

01:01:27.191 --> 01:01:28.733
Pack up and

01:01:28.984 --> 01:01:30.777
never come back.

01:01:32.196 --> 01:01:34.739
Alright, Brother Wing,
I'll join you in the pork business.

01:01:52.883 --> 01:01:53.883
Watch out!

01:02:03.769 --> 01:02:04.852
Stoop down!

01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:12.193
Seal all passageways!

01:02:12.486 --> 01:02:15.321
Lead the foreigners out.

01:02:15.572 --> 01:02:16.739
Yes!

01:02:17.116 --> 01:02:18.491
It's fighting outside.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.497
Foon, it must be the Shaho Gang.

01:02:24.748 --> 01:02:26.332
Go after them!

01:02:28.252 --> 01:02:29.502
Aunt 13!

01:02:36.427 --> 01:02:37.719
Stop it!

01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:43.433
- The Troops. - Yes, sir.

01:02:43.684 --> 01:02:44.767
Get ready.

01:02:45.227 --> 01:02:47.061
Don't shoot at the audience.

01:02:47.312 --> 01:02:48.813
- Gun shot! My god! - Don't shoot.

01:02:49.064 --> 01:02:50.440
No!

01:03:22.055 --> 01:03:25.433
Son...

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:32.940
You fool.

01:03:38.822 --> 01:03:40.156
Shoot him.

01:03:41.241 --> 01:03:42.533
No!

01:03:45.037 --> 01:03:47.413
Limestone powder. Close your eyes.

01:03:51.043 --> 01:03:52.543
My eyes...

01:03:54.171 --> 01:03:55.588
Don't get up.

01:04:08.519 --> 01:04:10.812
- Master Wong?
- Don't care about him, let's go.

01:04:13.941 --> 01:04:15.233
Protect His Excellency!

01:04:27.788 --> 01:04:29.038
Come on!

01:04:29.289 --> 01:04:33.334
Gun!

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:36.504
Hide away.

01:04:40.092 --> 01:04:44.136
Aunt 13, take the gun and hide with the reverend.

01:04:44.471 --> 01:04:47.682
They came for me. Don't stay here!

01:05:00.737 --> 01:05:02.530
Reverend Father!

01:05:38.066 --> 01:05:39.191
Master, take the pole!

01:06:00.505 --> 01:06:02.965
Master, I'll help you!

01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:09.263
The floor's too thin.

01:06:12.267 --> 01:06:14.560
- Master, I'll help you! - Who are you?

01:06:15.729 --> 01:06:17.438
Help Aunt 13, I don't need help.

01:06:45.759 --> 01:06:47.093
Leave her alone.

01:07:00.607 --> 01:07:02.775
Tiger, use your gun. You idiot, shoot him dead.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.406
Shoot them.

01:07:15.038 --> 01:07:16.330
No.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.834
Reverend Father.

01:07:21.253 --> 01:07:22.628
Go.

01:07:24.464 --> 01:07:27.717
- Father... - Reverend Father.

01:07:28.802 --> 01:07:30.928
Wing, come and protect Aunt 13.

01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:38.019
They've gone backstage!

01:07:58.290 --> 01:07:59.749
Come up here.

01:08:03.503 --> 01:08:04.503
Damn it.

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:19.977
Why ambush me?

01:08:19.978 --> 01:08:21.520
It's you who ambushed me?

01:08:21.772 --> 01:08:23.647
- Foon? - He's Foon?

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.941
It's dangerous here, there're killers inside.

01:08:27.444 --> 01:08:29.278
Question him, I'm going to have a look.

01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:31.572
Foon, what're you doing?

01:08:31.823 --> 01:08:32.823
How would I know?

01:08:32.823 --> 01:08:33.991
He's been hitting me ever

01:08:34.242 --> 01:08:35.201
since he came in.

01:08:35.452 --> 01:08:37.286
- Foon! - Don't move!

01:08:38.622 --> 01:08:40.081
You say don't move, but you still hit me?

01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:42.332
Let's sort this out before hitting anyone.

01:08:42.667 --> 01:08:44.585
Run, run!

01:08:50.258 --> 01:08:52.051
Master Wong, don't move!

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:56.346
- Your Excellency. - You shut up!

01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:58.890
Excellency, they left something.

01:09:02.145 --> 01:09:04.604
What? "Glory to Local Militia.
End to foreigners"?

01:09:05.607 --> 01:09:06.607
Weren't all the...

01:09:06.608 --> 01:09:08.024
Local Militia arrested?

01:09:11.071 --> 01:09:13.781
How many have you given shelter to?

01:09:15.033 --> 01:09:17.660
Your Excellency. I've been set up.

01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:19.370
Don't believe him.

01:09:19.621 --> 01:09:20.912
Arrest these Shaho thugs.

01:09:21.163 --> 01:09:22.163
What Shaho thugs?

01:09:24.167 --> 01:09:25.876
That's the second time you've hit me.

01:09:26.627 --> 01:09:28.045
Find out the truth before you lay blame.

01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:29.671
The truth?

01:09:33.676 --> 01:09:35.261
He's taking protection money.

01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:36.804
What? My Master takes protection money?

01:09:37.055 --> 01:09:38.430
Yes! It's him!

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:42.184
Master Wong, isn't he from Shaho?

01:09:42.435 --> 01:09:44.145
What's Shaho? The Yellow River?

01:09:47.357 --> 01:09:49.108
You don't need to explain.

01:09:50.277 --> 01:09:51.234
City Hall will soon arrest...

01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:53.779
your other members.

01:09:54.322 --> 01:09:56.240
It's time to arrest the head first.

01:09:56.491 --> 01:09:57.908
I'm going to arrest you first...

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.285
and close your Po Chi Lam.

01:09:59.536 --> 01:10:01.412
How'll you make trouble now?

01:10:02.455 --> 01:10:03.455
A lot of people were hurt at the theater,

01:10:03.707 --> 01:10:04.874
let me tend to them,

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:06.167
then I'll go with you.

01:10:08.545 --> 01:10:10.254
Alright, go ahead.

01:10:10.505 --> 01:10:12.173
You'll be guarded.

01:10:12.924 --> 01:10:14.175
If anything happens...

01:10:14.718 --> 01:10:17.011
I'll arrest and execute you right here.

01:10:20.599 --> 01:10:22.349
Don't move. You're bleeding.

01:10:25.312 --> 01:10:26.812
- So, fetch the medicine. - Ok!

01:10:30.317 --> 01:10:32.151
Go away. Can't you see the eviction notice?

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:41.035
That doesn't give you permission to steal.

01:10:41.286 --> 01:10:42.494
Bring them back!

01:10:43.663 --> 01:10:44.705
- You dare hit us? - Go away!

01:10:44.956 --> 01:10:48.250
Don't you have anything better to do?

01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:49.752
Master, they are stealing,

01:10:50.003 --> 01:10:51.420
I'm stopping them.

01:10:51.796 --> 01:10:53.881
So what? Wanna fight?

01:10:54.132 --> 01:10:55.299
I'll fight with you.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:56.008
OK, let's go!

01:10:56.009 --> 01:10:58.302
No! I mean I'll fight you!

01:10:59.179 --> 01:11:00.512
Master, I fight you?

01:11:00.764 --> 01:11:01.889
Where's you like hitting?

01:11:02.557 --> 01:11:04.183
Is it here? Here?

01:11:06.978 --> 01:11:08.854
You want me arrested sooner?

01:11:09.564 --> 01:11:13.192
- If not, don't block me saving people.
- Master!

01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:15.486
You're so manipulative. You used us.

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:19.782
We'll arrest you, if you stand in our way.

01:11:22.202 --> 01:11:23.661
He's smart,

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.579
escapes arrest this way.

01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:38.425
Come hit me? So restrained!

01:11:58.196 --> 01:12:00.072
Mr. Cheng!

01:12:01.074 --> 01:12:03.117
Still bleeding. Fetch me the "Last Aid"!

01:12:05.537 --> 01:12:06.829
"Last Aid"!

01:12:23.722 --> 01:12:27.182
He's dead. Tell his family.

01:12:37.485 --> 01:12:38.694
So...

01:12:55.295 --> 01:12:56.462
Fei Hung!

01:12:58.381 --> 01:12:59.673
What's the tattoo?

01:13:00.091 --> 01:13:03.177
It's Arabic numerals. "JACKSON"

01:13:03.595 --> 01:13:06.055
Is it his ship's name?

01:13:08.516 --> 01:13:11.143
Don't worry. I'm Wong Fei Hung.

01:13:11.394 --> 01:13:13.062
You're hurt. If you move,

01:13:13.313 --> 01:13:14.480
you'll tear the wound.

01:13:14.731 --> 01:13:20.611
You're Master Wong? Help me!

01:13:20.862 --> 01:13:24.948
Get up. Where're you from?

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.994
- America! - America?

01:13:30.789 --> 01:13:33.332
We crossed seas;

01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:36.543
denied medicine when ill.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.214
Many were thrown overboard.

01:13:42.425 --> 01:13:44.093
In America,

01:13:44.427 --> 01:13:48.555
we were branded like pigs.

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:52.476
We were cheated...

01:13:52.852 --> 01:13:54.937
by the Chinese dealers here.

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:57.898
We signed contracts, paid for food and the trip.

01:13:58.149 --> 01:14:00.192
Paid for so many things.

01:14:01.194 --> 01:14:05.489
Those who tried to escape were caught and killed.

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:09.159
I came back to China.

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:14.456
I... I...Master Wong...

01:14:14.707 --> 01:14:18.585
Don't worry, you're back in China now.

01:14:19.587 --> 01:14:21.004
Let me see if

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:22.589
I can find your family.

01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:25.676
Don't think too much.

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:31.723
Kai! Keep secret his contract
with the foreigners.

01:14:32.392 --> 01:14:34.393
Or City Hall will arrest him.

01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:36.270
I understand.

01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:40.649
Going to America's better than

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.318
staying here.

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:51.201
Don't miss out!...Come...Take a look!
You want one?

01:14:51.661 --> 01:14:54.121
Giong to America? How? Take one.

01:14:54.372 --> 01:14:56.165
You want one, too?

01:14:58.501 --> 01:14:59.960
The same America as in the newspaper?

01:15:00.211 --> 01:15:02.504
Right! If you want to go, pay an exit tax...

01:15:02.755 --> 01:15:04.423
pay your passage, rental, blanket and food.

01:15:04.674 --> 01:15:07.134
Get a 3 year contract.

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:08.427
You mean it costs 2 years salary?

01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:10.095
- Haven't you got money? - No, I haven't.

01:15:10.346 --> 01:15:11.638
Then don't even think about it.

01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:13.223
Shove off!

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:17.644
You want one, it's full of gold there.

01:15:17.896 --> 01:15:19.313
Someone's fighting there!

01:15:19.564 --> 01:15:23.525
Duel? Let's go and watch it. Go, go.

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:25.611
Don't go, don't go!

01:15:29.616 --> 01:15:31.408
You dare show off...

01:15:31.659 --> 01:15:33.744
in front of my house...

01:15:34.037 --> 01:15:36.497
and hit my disciple.

01:15:36.748 --> 01:15:38.290
What's your name?

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:40.125
Master Yim.

01:16:08.238 --> 01:16:11.740
I'm matchless in 1 9 provinces with my "7 Sabres".

01:16:12.033 --> 01:16:15.744
You're a guest, so I'll let you thrust 3 times.

01:16:18.414 --> 01:16:19.581
Then prepare!

01:16:40.603 --> 01:16:41.937
No. 2!

01:17:08.798 --> 01:17:11.508
Still No.2 and you already draw your sword?

01:17:11.843 --> 01:17:16.430
You will get killed. Let's forget it!

01:17:17.515 --> 01:17:18.724
Don't go.

01:17:48.212 --> 01:17:49.713
Hit me in the back?

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.532
"Iron Vest Kung Fu"!

01:18:21.454 --> 01:18:25.123
I've let you thrust 3 times. Admit defeat!

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:26.667
There must be a way to beat him.

01:19:47.498 --> 01:19:48.498
What are you following me for?

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.208
My name is Foon. I'm from May County.

01:19:50.877 --> 01:19:52.294
There're lots of gangs in this town.

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:53.879
My Kung Fu is poor.

01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:55.255
I'm often harassed.

01:19:55.506 --> 01:19:58.759
Can't even make a living.

01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:02.429
Please take me as your disciple.

01:20:04.265 --> 01:20:08.101
What's the point of being a Kung Fu expert?

01:20:08.352 --> 01:20:10.312
Can't make a living.

01:20:26.871 --> 01:20:29.915
Master, are you hungry?

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:32.083
You take shelter.

01:20:32.585 --> 01:20:34.002
I'll think of something.

01:20:35.838 --> 01:20:39.674
- Good! - Give me a drumstick!

01:20:39.926 --> 01:20:49.226
Good food, we don't eat bad food.

01:20:53.397 --> 01:20:55.899
Gentlemen, come inside!

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:01.112
The soup's salty. Don't drink it. Let's go!

01:21:05.284 --> 01:21:09.079
Today's soup's very salty.

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:15.001
Hey, why'd you steal my bowl?

01:21:15.753 --> 01:21:19.256
Gentlemen, welcome, come and have a drink.

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:22.092
Welcome gentlemen, let me sing to you.

01:21:22.343 --> 01:21:24.010
Master, have some soup.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.946
2 men drink from the same bowl. Pathetic!

01:21:44.156 --> 01:21:46.741
Madam, shall I have them thrown out?

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:52.539
If I made it here,

01:21:52.832 --> 01:21:55.208
who'd dare belittle me?

01:21:55.793 --> 01:21:57.711
Right, got to be the top.

01:21:58.254 --> 01:22:00.005
Who's the best in town?

01:22:00.339 --> 01:22:01.882
Master Wong?

01:22:45.009 --> 01:22:46.176
Fei Hung!

01:22:46.427 --> 01:22:52.515
Aunt 13, you're right. China must change.

01:22:53.267 --> 01:22:55.185
Fists can't fight guns.

01:22:56.812 --> 01:22:58.396
I'm under house arrest,

01:22:59.148 --> 01:23:00.732
soon I'll have to fight.

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:02.317
Take care!

01:23:02.568 --> 01:23:05.070
Fei Hung, I'll wait for you.

01:23:05.905 --> 01:23:07.197
You don't have to.

01:23:08.532 --> 01:23:09.866
If you do,

01:23:10.284 --> 01:23:12.494
I won't die in peace.

01:23:15.206 --> 01:23:16.957
You won't die...

01:23:20.461 --> 01:23:25.173
I'm only mortal... Go home!

01:23:28.094 --> 01:23:29.552
Wing, he...

01:23:38.104 --> 01:23:40.605
Wing, go inside, it's raining hard.

01:23:41.148 --> 01:23:43.024
Master didn't tell me to, so I daren't.

01:23:43.275 --> 01:23:44.567
Wing!

01:23:47.363 --> 01:23:50.949
- Go back to Po Chi Lam. - Master!...

01:23:52.493 --> 01:23:54.035
Come, go in!

01:23:57.415 --> 01:24:03.420
I...Master, let me do it!

01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:26.526
So!

01:25:03.773 --> 01:25:05.148
It's raining harder.

01:25:07.234 --> 01:25:08.818
This is closed, go!

01:25:21.582 --> 01:25:24.209
I'm "Iron Vest" Yim from Shandong...

01:25:24.668 --> 01:25:26.503
I'm here to...

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:31.049
challenge Master Wong.

01:25:32.718 --> 01:25:34.719
Please tell me who Master Wong is?

01:25:38.891 --> 01:25:41.434
- Master, a challenger! - Wing, pour tea!

01:25:41.685 --> 01:25:44.187
- Master! - Pour tea!

01:25:45.689 --> 01:25:47.107
Please!

01:25:47.483 --> 01:25:50.610
Kai, take the patients to one side.

01:25:56.367 --> 01:25:57.659
Have a seat!

01:26:01.705 --> 01:26:03.081
Why not fold the umbrella now you're inside?

01:26:10.673 --> 01:26:12.215
Have some tea!

01:26:14.343 --> 01:26:16.094
Foon, what're you doing?

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.179
Foon?

01:26:23.227 --> 01:26:25.895
Master Wong, your techniques are famous,

01:26:26.313 --> 01:26:27.272
especially your...

01:26:27.523 --> 01:26:29.649
"Shadowless Kick" and "Ten Forms Fist".

01:26:29.942 --> 01:26:33.319
I intend to open up my own school,

01:26:33.571 --> 01:26:34.988
thus I'm here to challenge you.

01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:37.365
So people will know...

01:26:37.616 --> 01:26:39.826
my martial arts is the best.

01:26:40.077 --> 01:26:41.452
I'm under house arrest,

01:26:41.829 --> 01:26:43.746
you could get in trouble.

01:26:44.248 --> 01:26:47.417
I can't fight you today.

01:26:47.751 --> 01:26:49.502
Be a man. Don't be a coward.

01:26:50.921 --> 01:26:51.963
Master Yim!

01:26:55.384 --> 01:26:57.886
I've patients here, so it's not ideal for combat.

01:26:58.137 --> 01:27:00.221
Wing, Kai!

01:27:00.472 --> 01:27:02.140
Want to be thrown out again?

01:27:29.793 --> 01:27:31.211
- What're you standing around for?
- Master.

01:27:31.462 --> 01:27:33.171
Take the patients to the back.

01:27:34.465 --> 01:27:36.257
I'll take you inside. They're going to fight.

01:27:36.508 --> 01:27:38.676
Why do you bother my patients?

01:27:38.928 --> 01:27:40.762
Move him or he'll get hurt by my master.

01:27:41.013 --> 01:27:43.264
Bull! If not for my Master, I'd beat you up.

01:27:43.515 --> 01:27:46.809
- Let go! - No!

01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:50.313
- Goddamn, Foon! - What?

01:27:50.564 --> 01:27:51.731
You dare try again?

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:16.107
Yim, stop fighting.

01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:22.322
If you go on, I'll fire!

01:29:22.865 --> 01:29:26.451
Don't hurt my Master. Give me!

01:29:38.797 --> 01:29:40.882
Master, are you alright?

01:30:00.986 --> 01:30:04.238
I'm "Iron Vest" Yim. I don't fear guns.

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:06.783
Wong Fei Hung, I won too easily,

01:30:07.034 --> 01:30:08.117
it doesn't count.

01:30:08.118 --> 01:30:09.243
Let's have a duel tomorrow in the street.

01:30:09.495 --> 01:30:11.329
If you don't come,

01:30:11.663 --> 01:30:14.832
I'll assume victory, Foon!

01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:18.044
You jerk!

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.104
You ungrateful shit!

01:30:43.904 --> 01:30:48.366
- Stupid! Stupid!
- Speak Chinese, you infidel.

01:30:56.917 --> 01:30:59.335
- Are you OK? - Yes, I just slipped!

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.962
The guards are hurt,

01:31:01.213 --> 01:31:02.422
there'll be trouble.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.799
City Hall will be here soon. Wing, Kai...

01:31:05.384 --> 01:31:07.552
go inside, get some money and go.

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.431
Aunt 13, go and wake the man from America.

01:31:11.849 --> 01:31:14.559
What're you standing around for? Get away.

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:16.436
Take the man with you.

01:31:17.855 --> 01:31:21.065
So, you don't know Kung Fu, you're defenseless.

01:31:22.067 --> 01:31:26.696
- Don't wait for them. Go now. - Mas...

01:31:27.698 --> 01:31:30.283
- Take care! - I'll see you off!

01:31:47.259 --> 01:31:50.136
Don't act recklessly.

01:31:50.429 --> 01:31:52.513
- Master! - Don't act rashly.

01:31:52.764 --> 01:31:54.682
Don't worry, your word is my command.

01:31:55.517 --> 01:31:57.560
Kai, tell Aunt 13
to take the man leave immediately.

01:31:58.812 --> 01:31:59.854
I release them...

01:31:59.855 --> 01:32:02.190
in order to get the whole gang. Search!

01:32:02.774 --> 01:32:06.194
Wait! I have many invalid patients here...

01:32:06.445 --> 01:32:07.904
They couldn't leave and
that's why they stayed here.

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:09.322
Please don't disturb them.

01:32:09.573 --> 01:32:10.907
Otherwise they'll become more seriously hurt.

01:32:11.533 --> 01:32:13.159
You asked me not to go inside?

01:32:13.410 --> 01:32:15.036
So there must be something inside.

01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:17.747
But I intend to catch you off guard...

01:32:17.998 --> 01:32:22.335
to see who might be hiding
with your patients. Search!

01:32:22.586 --> 01:32:24.045
Yes!

01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:30.384
- Someone's stealing away! - Chase them!

01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:34.430
Go.

01:32:36.391 --> 01:32:38.059
So, go quick!

01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:42.021
- Get them! - Yes!

01:32:43.023 --> 01:32:44.857
Wing, do it!

01:32:45.108 --> 01:32:46.234
What? Master?

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:51.906
Wing, I told you to do it!

01:32:52.699 --> 01:32:55.618
- Manchurian Dog! - You insult me?

01:32:55.869 --> 01:32:58.079
Samson's Lift!

01:33:01.625 --> 01:33:03.167
- Can we really fight? - Yes!

01:33:12.886 --> 01:33:14.303
Where's my gun?

01:33:26.441 --> 01:33:33.948
Where're you going? Come back. Shadowless Kick.

01:33:34.199 --> 01:33:35.783
- Go after them! - Yes!

01:33:42.958 --> 01:33:43.916
Don't bother.

01:33:44.167 --> 01:33:45.751
The man you want is here.

01:33:46.503 --> 01:33:48.296
- Divide up. - Yes!

01:33:51.383 --> 01:33:52.633
This way.

01:33:54.136 --> 01:33:55.928
Hold the pole, the rest go under.

01:34:21.496 --> 01:34:22.371
Wong Fei Hung,

01:34:22.372 --> 01:34:25.291
I arrest you on charges of treason!

01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:30.171
Your Excellency, I'll go with you.

01:34:30.756 --> 01:34:33.382
- Kai! - Master!

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:34.842
Kai, fetch medicine

01:34:35.093 --> 01:34:37.094
for the wounded.

01:34:38.138 --> 01:34:41.307
Medicine from Po Chi Lam is the best.

01:34:41.725 --> 01:34:43.392
How many are you?

01:34:44.227 --> 01:34:48.064
- Are you alright, Your Excellency?
- You good-for-nothing!

01:34:50.275 --> 01:34:52.568
We're about there. Hang on!

01:34:53.278 --> 01:34:55.905
Now we've got guns, we've got power.

01:34:56.156 --> 01:34:58.074
We have to find women for the foreigners.

01:34:59.618 --> 01:35:01.160
Sha...Shaho Gang!

01:35:01.787 --> 01:35:04.205
Hurry up, go that way.

01:35:06.458 --> 01:35:07.708
Woman!

01:35:12.089 --> 01:35:13.464
Let go of So!

01:35:20.055 --> 01:35:21.639
You get away!

01:35:23.475 --> 01:35:24.558
Don't let her go!

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:31.691
Let go!

01:35:31.942 --> 01:35:33.234
Sir, take care of yourself.

01:35:33.485 --> 01:35:36.487
Run! They're many. Don't stay for me.

01:35:50.627 --> 01:35:51.669
Go to hell!

01:35:52.754 --> 01:35:53.879
Go!

01:35:55.841 --> 01:35:57.967
- Let me go! - Go!

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.473
There's one over there. Get him!

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:06.809
Get him! Don't go.

01:36:08.145 --> 01:36:09.520
Damn you

01:36:09.813 --> 01:36:11.480
come to help me now?

01:36:15.152 --> 01:36:20.364
Punching Po Chi Lam Kicking Wong Fei Hung?

01:36:20.615 --> 01:36:23.117
Challenging Master Wong!

01:36:23.827 --> 01:36:27.538
Yes, we're not going home. Let's wait here!

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:32.334
When do you think Master Wong will be here?

01:36:53.565 --> 01:36:55.649
Open your mouth wide.

01:37:01.239 --> 01:37:02.490
Open the door!

01:37:06.286 --> 01:37:07.536
Go away!

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:17.630
You dare shoot me? You'll be shipped tonight!

01:37:17.881 --> 01:37:19.298
Do you hate me?

01:37:19.549 --> 01:37:20.800
I want to taste your fresh

01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:23.761
Will your skin need spicing up?

01:37:28.141 --> 01:37:32.144
When you have to serve those stinking labourers,

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:35.773
you're gonna remember me. Take her to my room!

01:37:36.024 --> 01:37:37.107
Yes!

01:37:38.318 --> 01:37:41.028
Big Brother, the one who beat Wong is here.

01:37:41.738 --> 01:37:43.989
Great!

01:37:44.282 --> 01:37:46.784
Good, now Fa Shan will be ours.

01:37:51.373 --> 01:37:52.998
Master!

01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:55.251
You know each other?
Foon is now your Big Brother.

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:56.877
Confide in him.

01:37:57.128 --> 01:38:00.631
He's the Big Brother? Call him Big Brother.

01:38:00.882 --> 01:38:03.133
Big Brother!

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:06.470
OK...

01:38:06.721 --> 01:38:09.014
Remember he's Big Brother.

01:38:09.266 --> 01:38:10.391
Master, I'm busy tonight.

01:38:10.642 --> 01:38:12.560
Please excuse me!

01:38:12.811 --> 01:38:15.145
We'll talk about the new School tomorrow.

01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:18.190
Get the present for Master ready.

01:38:22.904 --> 01:38:23.863
Master Yim,

01:38:24.114 --> 01:38:26.866
this is for you to open a School.

01:38:27.158 --> 01:38:30.369
The Yim's Fist Style will conquer Fu Shan.

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:33.455
Come...let's toast Master Yim!

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.500
Cheers, Master!

01:39:37.812 --> 01:39:39.313
Don't move! What do you want?

01:39:40.565 --> 01:39:41.690
Master Wong,

01:39:42.192 --> 01:39:45.444
we all admire you.

01:39:45.737 --> 01:39:47.446
We know you've been set up.

01:39:48.615 --> 01:39:50.950
Master Wong, we've decided to free you...

01:39:51.201 --> 01:39:53.953
and we'll take responsibility for it.

01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:56.789
Master Wong, this way!

01:39:57.499 --> 01:39:59.291
Great! Let's go, Master!

01:40:02.587 --> 01:40:03.754
Master!

01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:08.425
There're laws in China,
I won't make a mockery of them.

01:40:08.677 --> 01:40:11.553
- Go! Master! - Go with Master!

01:40:12.472 --> 01:40:16.100
No, Excellency. I appreciate it, but I won't go.

01:40:16.351 --> 01:40:19.395
- Wong... - Master Wong is over there.

01:40:20.105 --> 01:40:23.232
Mas...Master!

01:40:23.483 --> 01:40:24.608
Master, you're still here?

01:40:25.527 --> 01:40:29.113
- So! - Master...Mas...Mas...

01:40:29.698 --> 01:40:30.739
Speak slowly.

01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.282
Master... Aunt 13 and I took that man,

01:40:32.534 --> 01:40:33.701
but we ran into the Shaho Gang.

01:40:33.952 --> 01:40:35.285
They killed him

01:40:35.537 --> 01:40:36.620
and captured Aunt 13.

01:40:36.621 --> 01:40:38.706
- Think of something to save her. - What?

01:40:40.166 --> 01:40:41.500
Master Wong, let's go and save her.

01:40:45.213 --> 01:40:46.964
Wing, I'll give you a few men.

01:40:47.215 --> 01:40:48.007
Good!

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:49.425
- Let them go! - Yes!

01:40:50.176 --> 01:40:52.177
Buck Teeth So, how come you spoke so fast?

01:40:52.429 --> 01:40:55.347
I was...rehearsing all the way.

01:41:05.025 --> 01:41:08.277
I'm sure you'll miss the
Chinese food when you return.

01:41:12.115 --> 01:41:13.741
Isn't that Master Wong?

01:41:19.539 --> 01:41:20.706
Aren't they the Local Militia?

01:41:42.437 --> 01:41:44.146
Master, you're great.

01:41:44.397 --> 01:41:45.939
You even beat Wong Fei Hung.

01:41:46.191 --> 01:41:49.902
Give us a little demo.

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.404
Just a little? Just a little?

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:16.386
OK!

01:42:49.254 --> 01:42:51.964
Bitch! The hell with you!

01:43:41.806 --> 01:43:43.765
That'st enough, Master, enough!

01:43:51.107 --> 01:43:52.691
Master, that's enough!

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.277
What's wrong?

01:43:55.945 --> 01:43:57.571
This money is dirty.

01:43:57.822 --> 01:43:58.989
Don't accept it.

01:43:59.365 --> 01:44:00.365
What? You insulting us?

01:44:00.617 --> 01:44:01.658
What are you doing?

01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:02.951
What do you mean?

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:04.161
You looking down on us?

01:44:04.537 --> 01:44:09.499
Nothing in this world is perfect...

01:44:10.627 --> 01:44:13.754
Virture is often found among the lowly...

01:44:14.839 --> 01:44:18.175
Our priority is to make our name in Fa Shan.

01:44:18.635 --> 01:44:21.136
When that's achieved,

01:44:21.387 --> 01:44:23.263
we can talk justice.

01:44:24.265 --> 01:44:28.936
That's life. Foon, pick up the money!

01:44:45.787 --> 01:44:48.664
Pick up the money! Pick up the money!

01:44:51.042 --> 01:45:22.197
Pick up the money!

01:45:22.573 --> 01:45:23.657
You think you're a Big Brother?

01:45:23.908 --> 01:45:25.242
I think you're a nobody!

01:45:25.493 --> 01:45:27.035
Foon!

01:45:29.247 --> 01:45:48.640
Pick up the money!

01:45:49.434 --> 01:45:53.645
Make our name in Fa Shan? That's life!

01:46:22.467 --> 01:46:25.761
Big Brother! ...

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:27.262
Bastard!

01:46:32.727 --> 01:46:34.102
Damn you!

01:46:42.236 --> 01:46:47.115
Aunt 13, wake up!

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:49.159
Bastard, don't touch me!

01:46:49.410 --> 01:46:51.119
Don't scream, I've come to help you.

01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:02.214
Foon, is it you? So many people are coming!

01:47:02.465 --> 01:47:04.216
Make off, I'll cover you. Quickly, go!

01:47:19.357 --> 01:47:20.649
Get that woman!

01:47:34.789 --> 01:47:36.706
Foon, stop or...

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.793
I'll kill this woman.

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:46.466
Our Big Brother? Go to hell!

01:47:46.717 --> 01:47:48.635
Hit me? Damn you!

01:47:48.970 --> 01:47:50.887
- Master, they are inside. - Let's go in!

01:47:51.514 --> 01:47:52.639
What's going on?

01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:55.016
Master, Foon in no time at all...

01:47:55.393 --> 01:47:57.144
tried to force himself...

01:47:57.395 --> 01:47:58.437
on my life.

01:47:58.688 --> 01:48:01.231
- No, it's not true... - Shut up!

01:48:06.487 --> 01:48:10.157
Foon, you scum, apologize to your brother.

01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:13.785
Yim, we met at Po Chi Lam.

01:48:14.036 --> 01:48:16.496
Shut up, you bitch! Go!

01:48:18.624 --> 01:48:20.041
You want rebel?

01:48:21.627 --> 01:48:24.212
Stupid, she's not his wife.

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:25.464
Stupid.

01:48:25.715 --> 01:48:30.093
- She's related to Wong Fei Hung.
- Wong Hung?

01:48:36.726 --> 01:48:37.934
Foon is trying to escape!

01:48:38.603 --> 01:48:39.603
Escape?

01:49:06.631 --> 01:49:07.631
How dare you.

01:49:17.475 --> 01:49:20.560
Come back! Get him!

01:49:51.384 --> 01:49:52.717
Stop right there

01:49:55.054 --> 01:49:56.888
I've brought some Chinese gal here
for Mr. Jackson.

01:49:57.139 --> 01:50:00.141
We come to see him tonight. open the gate.

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:03.520
Mr. Jackson is expecting us, come on

01:50:04.188 --> 01:50:07.983
Open the gate now, come on.

01:50:10.486 --> 01:50:12.696
We're getting cold, please.

01:50:12.947 --> 01:50:14.781
Mr. Jackson will be very happy.

01:50:16.284 --> 01:50:19.452
- Open the gate. - Open the gate.

01:50:24.083 --> 01:50:26.001
Thank you, come on.

01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:33.341
- Take it easy! - Yes, Big Brother!

01:50:33.593 --> 01:50:35.719
- It hurts. - Right!

01:50:37.179 --> 01:50:40.890
Master, these people have turned on me...

01:50:41.142 --> 01:50:43.518
They'll do the same to you, don't trust them.

01:50:43.769 --> 01:50:44.853
You don't trust your brothers,

01:50:45.104 --> 01:50:46.688
yet speak out for Wong?

01:50:48.399 --> 01:50:51.484
How is it? Too cruel, not used to it?

01:50:56.324 --> 01:50:57.449
Let him go,

01:50:57.783 --> 01:50:59.075
I'll do anything you want.

01:50:59.327 --> 01:51:01.703
What makes you want to sacrifice for him?

01:51:01.954 --> 01:51:05.874
Bargain with me? Damn you.

01:51:06.125 --> 01:51:07.667
Are you Master Wong's woman?

01:51:11.255 --> 01:51:13.840
When I'm done, your face will be so scratched...

01:51:14.091 --> 01:51:16.801
Master Wong won't recognize you.

01:51:20.056 --> 01:51:21.723
Where's the woman you took away today?

01:51:23.184 --> 01:51:28.021
- Big Brother! Master Wong is here!
- Master Wong?

01:51:29.982 --> 01:51:30.982
Fei Hung?

01:51:31.233 --> 01:51:32.776
- Arm yourselves. - Yes!

01:51:33.444 --> 01:51:35.570
- Get all the guns out. - Yes.

01:51:35.863 --> 01:51:37.989
Go, get all the woman on the ship.

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:40.367
Master, Wong challenges us.

01:51:40.618 --> 01:51:41.743
Fight for us?

01:51:41.994 --> 01:51:43.203
Don't worry!

01:51:45.081 --> 01:51:47.165
- Foon! - Go!

01:51:47.416 --> 01:51:49.542
Aunt 13!

01:51:49.794 --> 01:51:51.336
Go!

01:51:51.587 --> 01:51:54.339
Let's see how Master Yim
finish Wong Fei Hung.

01:52:06.977 --> 01:52:09.562
You're not needed here, go search for Aunt 13.

01:52:09.814 --> 01:52:11.189
Yes.

01:52:12.608 --> 01:52:14.109
Master Wong!

01:52:15.611 --> 01:52:19.614
Master Yim, win or lose, it's just a game.

01:52:22.034 --> 01:52:23.868
You've got no excuse not to fight.

01:52:30.584 --> 01:52:31.793
As you wish.

01:53:33.314 --> 01:53:34.731
It's down there!

01:53:35.274 --> 01:53:36.524
"External Chi Kung"?

01:53:37.026 --> 01:53:40.069
Today only one of us leaves here alive.

01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:43.531
Hey, how do you fire a gun?

01:54:15.648 --> 01:54:16.856
Don't worry, we have guns.

01:54:54.937 --> 01:54:58.565
You said you're good, come on.

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:05.905
I'll help you, Master.

01:55:08.367 --> 01:55:09.784
Porky?

01:55:21.839 --> 01:55:23.047
Anymore?

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.486
Hey, Buck Teeth So! It's you?

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:50.491
Come up and get me down. Quickly!

01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:53.912
Aunt 13's been kidnapped by the Shaho Gang.

01:55:54.163 --> 01:55:55.121
- What? - What?

01:55:56.582 --> 01:55:58.333
Aunt 13's been kidnapped by the Shaho Gang,

01:55:58.792 --> 01:56:03.296
Hey, get me down, Buck Teeth So!

01:56:03.839 --> 01:56:05.465
I'm sorry, I forgot!

01:56:09.428 --> 01:56:10.762
Your Excellency.

01:56:11.722 --> 01:56:13.056
Enemy is approaching.

01:56:20.439 --> 01:56:21.481
General, please!

01:56:21.732 --> 01:56:24.734
This is General Wickens of
Her Majesty's Royal Armed Forces.

01:56:24.985 --> 01:56:26.319
I'm escorting this Chinese officer...

01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:28.696
who comes in search of escape prisoners.

01:56:28.948 --> 01:56:32.408
On his behalf, I request permission
to search your premises.

01:56:32.826 --> 01:56:35.370
This is the territory of
the United States of America.

01:56:35.621 --> 01:56:37.705
Permission is not granted, and any trespassing...

01:56:37.957 --> 01:56:40.458
will be regarded as direct
violation of our Federal Laws.

01:56:41.210 --> 01:56:42.669
Damn your Yankee laws!

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.337
Damn you Brits to hell!

01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:53.596
Stop! Don't shoot...stop! ...

01:56:53.847 --> 01:56:56.599
Excellency, it's dangerous here. Better leave.

01:57:04.733 --> 01:57:06.192
Brothers, get inside.

01:57:11.031 --> 01:57:11.990
Big Brother, anymore?

01:57:12.241 --> 01:57:13.324
Kai, I'll help Master,

01:57:13.575 --> 01:57:14.534
you save Aunt 13.

01:57:14.785 --> 01:57:16.536
No, I'll stay!

01:57:16.787 --> 01:57:18.496
You go!

01:57:18.956 --> 01:57:20.957
I'm Big Brother! You listen to me!

01:57:32.678 --> 01:57:35.221
You both don't have to stay. Go save Aunt 13.

01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:37.265
Go!

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:50.398
Master Wong!

02:00:29.354 --> 02:00:30.646
A sneak attack.

02:00:31.565 --> 02:00:33.357
It's all in self defense.

02:00:34.276 --> 02:00:35.902
You call this Yim's Martial Arts?

02:00:36.653 --> 02:00:39.322
The world's full of surprises.
Must take precautions.

02:00:42.117 --> 02:00:45.494
Be quick, the ship's leaving. Take them aboard!

02:00:46.622 --> 02:00:47.747
Go, bitch!

02:00:47.998 --> 02:00:51.542
Fei Hung...it's Aunt 13. Fei Hung!

02:01:03.805 --> 02:01:07.600
Fei Hung... I'm Aunt 13...

02:01:08.727 --> 02:01:12.480
Bring her to the ship, go.

02:01:14.566 --> 02:01:16.275
Troops, attention.

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:21.197
Mr. Jackson, Master Wong is here!

02:01:22.115 --> 02:01:23.866
Master Wong, take him on!

02:01:24.701 --> 02:01:26.035
The ship's over there!

02:01:27.287 --> 02:01:30.748
Hung, take them to the cabin.

02:01:30.999 --> 02:01:31.916
Yes, sir.

02:01:31.917 --> 02:01:33.542
Line up the men, ready now.

02:01:41.635 --> 02:01:43.552
Go down, quick!

02:01:47.182 --> 02:01:48.266
Turn around.

02:02:05.075 --> 02:02:06.951
There...there!

02:02:08.787 --> 02:02:10.329
Leave him to me.

02:02:11.498 --> 02:02:13.291
They're yours.

02:03:37.292 --> 02:03:41.629
Master Wong!

02:03:43.715 --> 02:03:45.591
Master Yim, we are done!

02:03:53.308 --> 02:03:54.433
He's leaving.

02:03:54.434 --> 02:03:56.185
Master Wong, watch out!

02:04:02.692 --> 02:04:06.070
Master Wong, where're you?
We haven't finished yet.

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:17.957
Master!

02:04:28.635 --> 02:04:31.095
I am Iron Vest...

02:04:31.346 --> 02:04:34.515
Master Yim!

02:04:40.981 --> 02:04:46.026
- Master Yim... - Wong...

02:04:46.278 --> 02:04:52.283
We can't fight guns with Kung fu.

02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:06.714
You scum.

02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:15.407
Master Wong, don't go!

02:06:18.995 --> 02:06:21.956
Still going? Don't shoot!

02:06:22.207 --> 02:06:23.207
Load the cannon.

02:06:26.753 --> 02:06:29.880
This is Commander Man from the
Provincial Government of Guangdong.

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:37.763
1 2 o'clock 30 degrees.

02:06:43.103 --> 02:06:46.021
- No, 1 0 o'clock 40 degrees. - What?

02:06:46.731 --> 02:06:48.691
- 1 0 o'clock 40 degrees. - Aim, fire!

02:06:48.942 --> 02:06:51.443
- Wait! - Fire!

02:06:57.450 --> 02:06:58.909
Oh, God!

02:07:01.871 --> 02:07:04.415
Damn you Yankees. They've hit my ship.

02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:30.899
You there, check the ship.

02:07:31.943 --> 02:07:35.571
Who is this Wong Fei Hung?

02:07:42.162 --> 02:07:43.287
Foon!

02:07:44.289 --> 02:07:45.372
Kill him!

02:07:50.670 --> 02:07:51.712
Watch out!

02:08:10.023 --> 02:08:13.651
Master Wong, have the guts to fight man to man.

02:08:15.070 --> 02:08:16.820
Fei Hung, he's got a gun on his knife.

02:08:17.072 --> 02:08:18.405
Watch out, don't fall into his trap!

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:20.032
Shut up.

02:08:38.134 --> 02:08:39.760
Bitch, you brought them here,

02:08:40.011 --> 02:08:42.513
so I'll burn your face.

02:08:42.764 --> 02:08:44.723
Let's see which is faster, you or my gun.

02:08:49.896 --> 02:08:51.063
Die!

02:08:57.862 --> 02:08:59.488
Oh, let me go!

02:09:27.267 --> 02:09:28.434
- Mr. Jackson. - Sir.

02:09:30.437 --> 02:09:31.687
Mr. Jackson and the Shaho Gang...

02:09:31.938 --> 02:09:33.772
sold women to America.

02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:35.441
Your Excellency, save us.

02:09:36.693 --> 02:09:41.572
Shaho Gang, I will reward to catch all woman.

02:09:41.823 --> 02:09:42.865
By law, you can't kill me,

02:09:43.116 --> 02:09:44.742
you must hand me to the Govt.

02:09:49.789 --> 02:09:51.123
You have violated international law.

02:09:51.374 --> 02:09:52.624
Put down the gun!

02:09:52.876 --> 02:09:56.044
- Why won't it fire?
- Did I forget to load it?

02:09:57.255 --> 02:09:59.882
If you don't put it down, I'll kill him!

02:10:00.133 --> 02:10:01.425
Put down the gun!

02:10:15.648 --> 02:10:17.191
You've hurt a Chinese Official...

02:10:17.442 --> 02:10:18.776
in a forbidden area.

02:10:19.027 --> 02:10:19.985
How will you explain it to the Chinese Govt.?

02:10:20.236 --> 02:10:23.530
Don't let even one Chinese live.

02:10:23.782 --> 02:10:30.078
Then I won't have to explain to any Govt. !

02:10:37.337 --> 02:10:38.754
You scum!

02:10:39.339 --> 02:10:40.547
You don't have to explain!

02:10:56.189 --> 02:10:57.898
- Your Excellency.
- Wow, you dare jump this high.

02:10:58.149 --> 02:11:00.567
Child's play. No big deal.

02:11:02.695 --> 02:11:05.989
Thank you Your Excellency!

02:11:06.241 --> 02:11:08.116
All credit to Master Wong.

02:11:08.368 --> 02:11:09.743
- Don't mention it. - Thanks Master Wong!

02:11:09.994 --> 02:11:11.328
Thank you Master Wong!

02:11:25.969 --> 02:11:29.304
China's changed so much, how call I cope?

02:11:30.306 --> 02:11:33.517
America? Do they really have gold there?

02:11:34.811 --> 02:11:36.728
If they really do have gold,

02:11:37.063 --> 02:11:39.398
why would they come here?

02:11:40.775 --> 02:11:42.985
Maybe we're standing on gold now.

02:12:12.765 --> 02:12:15.434
After this drink, you'll be my Master.

02:12:15.768 --> 02:12:18.562
But Aunt 13 and I are so close now...

02:12:18.855 --> 02:12:20.689
We'll be together from morning to night.

02:12:21.024 --> 02:12:22.524
If one day she marries me,

02:12:22.942 --> 02:12:25.068
then you'll have to call me Uncle.

02:12:25.570 --> 02:12:30.741
I'll be your senior so you'll have to serve me.

02:12:31.409 --> 02:12:33.619
Foon, what are you thinking?

02:12:35.246 --> 02:12:36.663
Have some tea, Master!
