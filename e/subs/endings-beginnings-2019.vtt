WEBVTT

01:16.435 --> 01:18.368
Well, we can have a date night.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.603
- That would be so nice.
- Who's here?

01:20.605 --> 01:22.472
- Aunt Daphne!
- Who's here?

01:22.474 --> 01:24.441
Hi, baby girl.

01:24.443 --> 01:27.878
Someone has been counting
the seconds until you showed up.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.647
It is so good to see you.

01:29.649 --> 01:32.049
I'm so excited
to do some crafts with you.

01:32.051 --> 01:34.551
I made
some very good plans for us.

01:34.553 --> 01:35.953
You made
some good plans for us?

01:35.955 --> 01:37.622
Yeah.

02:14.426 --> 02:18.996
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

02:18.998 --> 02:24.467
♪ Happy birthday, dear Adrian ♪

02:43.122 --> 02:44.922
It was
at some Chinese supermarket.

02:44.924 --> 02:46.657
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

02:46.659 --> 02:48.759
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:48.761 --> 02:50.460
- Good to see you.
- Thanks.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.899
Right on time, 30 minutes late.

02:55.768 --> 02:58.368
I almost
did not come today.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.670
Oh, no.

02:59.672 --> 03:01.437
I just want
you both to know that.

03:01.439 --> 03:04.376
- Uh, I broke up with Adrian.
- Well, that's...

03:05.477 --> 03:07.013
And I quit my job.

03:08.580 --> 03:11.951
And I'm living
in Billie's pool house again.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.518
And everything's great.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.789
Oh...

03:18.791 --> 03:20.927
All in the last seven days?

03:22.028 --> 03:23.894
Hey, more than anything,

03:23.896 --> 03:26.096
I just feel, like, this
extreme amount of self-hate.

03:26.098 --> 03:27.798
I mean, he loved me so much,

03:27.800 --> 03:30.801
and he took
such good care of me, and he...

03:30.803 --> 03:33.904
Like, I really thought
that he was gonna be the one.

03:33.906 --> 03:35.505
- Yeah.
- You know?

03:35.507 --> 03:37.041
Investing four years
into something?

03:37.043 --> 03:40.010
Like, I'll just be
like my mom forever, just...

03:40.012 --> 03:41.745
- That's not true.
- searching for a yes

03:41.747 --> 03:43.479
and not finding it, but...

03:43.481 --> 03:45.716
Maybe it's time
to take a break, you know?

03:45.718 --> 03:47.785
- I mean, I know that's...
- Take a break from what? Dating?

03:47.787 --> 03:51.521
a radical idea, but yeah.
Yeah, a break from all of it.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.658
A break from dating.
A break from...

03:54.660 --> 03:56.160
running and chasing

03:56.162 --> 03:58.595
and, like, reaching out
for some outside thing

03:58.597 --> 04:01.665
and just take time alone.

04:01.667 --> 04:04.001
That thought's terrifying.

04:04.003 --> 04:05.703
That's probably a good thing.

04:05.705 --> 04:07.537
And, you know, if you need work,

04:07.539 --> 04:09.106
why don't you just take
a couple of shifts here?

04:09.108 --> 04:10.674
- I could totally use the help.
- Really?

04:10.676 --> 04:12.475
Oh, yes.
There's a million things

04:12.477 --> 04:13.878
you could do here.
Are you kidding?

04:13.880 --> 04:14.981
It'd be great.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.217
So six months?

04:20.219 --> 04:22.887
- Six solo months.
- All right.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.487
It'll just be me
and my vibrator.

04:26.491 --> 04:29.525
And I'm just gonna
throw alcohol in there,

04:29.527 --> 04:31.929
- because why not? So...
- Wow.

04:31.931 --> 04:35.165
Wow, that would
be very impressive

04:35.167 --> 04:37.533
- if you could pull off...
- Have a little faith in me.

04:37.535 --> 04:39.502
- I have faith in you.
- I can do it.

04:39.504 --> 04:42.172
I know you can do it.
I mean, I was just...

04:42.174 --> 04:45.075
Look, I have to do it
for the next seven months, too,

04:45.077 --> 04:47.914
so it's nice to have
a partner in crime, right?

04:49.514 --> 04:52.482
We're gonna
go into warrior now.

04:55.955 --> 04:57.721
So, um...
Yeah, so fill me in.

04:57.723 --> 04:59.723
Like, let me know
what you've been up to and...

04:59.725 --> 05:02.226
Yeah, I mean, similarly to what
we spoke about on the phone,

05:02.228 --> 05:05.495
I was in... from Los Angeles
originally, moved to New York.

05:05.497 --> 05:07.597
That's where I really got
my feet off the ground.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.233
I've never actually worked
in a gallery before,

05:09.235 --> 05:11.601
but I have a lot of experience
dealing with galleries

05:11.603 --> 05:13.137
and understanding
how they function

05:13.139 --> 05:14.604
and, you know, what people
want from the outside,

05:14.606 --> 05:16.073
what people are desiring
from the inside.

05:16.075 --> 05:19.009
And it's exciting to me,
specifically curation.

05:19.011 --> 05:21.879
Okay, so you were in programming
at LACMA for four years.

05:21.881 --> 05:23.714
- Yes.
- And then...

05:23.716 --> 05:27.485
the Los Angeles Center
for Progress in the Arts for...

05:28.254 --> 05:30.955
for six months? That's...

05:30.957 --> 05:33.659
Yeah, it just
wasn't the culture for me.

05:34.727 --> 05:35.761
Hmm.

05:36.996 --> 05:38.696
Okay.

05:38.698 --> 05:40.530
COBRA coverage.
This is Beth speaking.

05:40.532 --> 05:41.865
How can I help you?

05:41.867 --> 05:44.034
Hi there.
Uh, I just need to check

05:44.036 --> 05:46.602
and see how long
my coverage is gonna last.

05:46.604 --> 05:49.507
Can I get the contact
of your previous supervisor?

05:51.177 --> 05:54.111
Um, Jed Hill.

05:54.113 --> 05:56.814
Do we have permission
to call him on your behalf?

06:02.955 --> 06:03.990
Hello?

06:05.024 --> 06:06.558
Yeah, of course.

06:28.613 --> 06:30.615
I don't know
why you're doing this.

06:32.218 --> 06:35.154
I don't really know
why I am, either.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.839
Hi. My name is Daphne Mirador.

06:55.841 --> 06:57.274
It's so lovely
to speak with you.

06:57.276 --> 06:59.143
Thank you so much
for taking the time.

06:59.145 --> 07:02.780
Um, I worked for Los Angeles
Center for Progress in the Arts.

07:02.782 --> 07:06.316
I have a lot of experience
in the nonprofit art world,

07:06.318 --> 07:09.286
uh, bringing art
and creative expression,

07:09.288 --> 07:10.921
whether that be fine art...

07:10.923 --> 07:13.023
In five years,
I would love to be working...

07:13.025 --> 07:15.325
I mean, I would love to be
working with you guys.

07:15.327 --> 07:17.294
And that's really something
that I'm passionate about,

07:17.296 --> 07:19.229
because so many artists,
as you know, are out there

07:19.231 --> 07:21.065
struggling and
just trying to get by

07:21.067 --> 07:24.701
and trying to make it,
and there's oftentimes...

07:24.703 --> 07:27.037
Yeah, of course.

07:27.039 --> 07:28.939
No worries at all.
I'll check back in...

07:28.941 --> 07:30.974
in a few months
and see where you guys are at.

07:30.976 --> 07:32.976
Yeah, n-no problem. Um...

07:32.978 --> 07:34.878
w-would it be good, perhaps,

07:34.880 --> 07:37.249
if I checked back in
in a couple of weeks?

07:40.653 --> 07:43.187
Okay. Uh, s-sorry.

07:43.189 --> 07:45.656
Um, do you happen
to know anyone else

07:45.658 --> 07:47.126
who may be hiring right now?

07:49.662 --> 07:51.228
Well, what do you want to be?

07:51.230 --> 07:53.232
I'm whatever I want to be.

07:55.901 --> 07:58.335
Trying to get ready
for the danger with this.

08:00.039 --> 08:02.372
There you go.

08:02.374 --> 08:05.175
Yep, that's your magic wand.

08:05.177 --> 08:09.012
When I do this,
your thingie moves like this.

08:17.723 --> 08:18.958
Fuck.

08:20.693 --> 08:22.962
Hey, can I get
some quarters, please?

08:55.394 --> 08:57.427
Oh, there you are.

08:57.429 --> 08:58.929
Merry Christmas.

08:58.931 --> 09:01.265
Same to you. Come on in.

09:01.267 --> 09:03.066
- Ohh.
- Have you heard from Billie?

09:03.068 --> 09:05.736
Uh, she hasn't told me
when they're coming.

09:05.738 --> 09:07.738
Uh, yeah. No, Abby has the flu,

09:07.740 --> 09:09.373
so I don't think
they're gonna make it...

09:09.375 --> 09:11.008
- Oh, no.
- unfortunately. Yeah.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.944
- Oh, I'm... I'm so...
- Looks nice in here.

09:13.946 --> 09:16.313
Yeah. Uh, you know,
Carl has really let me

09:16.315 --> 09:18.081
sort of... How do I put it?

09:18.083 --> 09:19.917
My own personal touch
on this place,

09:19.919 --> 09:21.952
so it feels much more like home.

09:21.954 --> 09:23.854
I haven't been for a while.

09:23.856 --> 09:26.290
I guess so,
like everywhere and there.

09:26.292 --> 09:27.824
Mm-hmm.

09:27.826 --> 09:31.128
You know,
who I did that for. Um...

09:31.130 --> 09:33.330
sometimes not...

09:33.332 --> 09:35.465
- what year and stuff, but...
- Yeah, yeah.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.868
- Of course.
- Yeah. It's been, like, uh...

09:37.870 --> 09:39.436
a month out of the year,
I'm flying.

09:39.438 --> 09:41.038
No, I'm okay, actually.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.773
- I'm not drinking right now.
- Why not?

09:42.775 --> 09:44.775
Just need to take a break.

09:44.777 --> 09:47.110
Oh, honey, this is
not the time to stop drinking,

09:47.112 --> 09:48.912
on Christmas.

09:48.914 --> 09:51.815
Here. Is Adrian
gonna meet us here or...

09:51.817 --> 09:53.352
Um, Adrian and I broke up.

09:55.854 --> 09:57.187
When did this happen?

09:57.189 --> 09:59.890
Um, few weeks ago.

10:02.027 --> 10:05.462
Wow. I did not know that.

10:05.464 --> 10:07.266
I can't say that I'm surprised.

10:08.434 --> 10:09.933
What do you mean?

10:09.935 --> 10:11.935
Well, I... You know, look,

10:11.937 --> 10:14.838
Adrian was a...
was a very lovely guy,

10:14.840 --> 10:17.376
but he clearly
wasn't the one, right?

10:19.044 --> 10:20.444
Time will tell.

10:20.446 --> 10:22.879
There was no...
There was no fire.

10:22.881 --> 10:24.348
There was no...

10:24.350 --> 10:27.152
There wasn't that passion.

10:29.054 --> 10:31.421
Well, we had... I mean,
we had a great relationship.

10:31.423 --> 10:34.825
You know, he's...
he's a wonderful person.

10:34.827 --> 10:36.526
So where are...
where are you living now?

10:36.528 --> 10:38.962
At Billie's.

10:38.964 --> 10:41.033
Ah, right.

10:43.102 --> 10:45.202
Well, my daughters
are very secretive.

10:45.204 --> 10:47.004
- I had no idea.
- Not intentionally.

10:47.006 --> 10:48.974
You can call us anytime.
You know that.

10:50.242 --> 10:52.342
I'm really glad.
I'm glad you're...

10:52.344 --> 10:55.279
you're with Billie and you
get to be with your niece.

10:55.281 --> 10:57.082
I'm sure
she's thrilled about that.

11:00.886 --> 11:02.486
Oh. All right,
I gotta give this to you.

11:02.488 --> 11:05.522
I can't...

11:07.627 --> 11:09.226
I came across this,

11:09.228 --> 11:13.432
and I thought,
"This belongs to Daphne."

11:16.035 --> 11:17.200
Merry Christmas.

11:17.202 --> 11:18.237
Thank you.

11:26.045 --> 11:27.911
Wow, is this the...

11:27.913 --> 11:30.082
Is that your wedding ring
from my father?

11:31.050 --> 11:32.916
I have a life with Carl now,

11:32.918 --> 11:35.352
and, you know,
I came across that,

11:35.354 --> 11:38.121
and I-I thought... I thought
it would make you happy.

11:38.123 --> 11:40.125
Yeah, it's won... it's beautiful.

11:55.642 --> 11:57.343
Happy birthday, baby.

11:58.977 --> 12:00.346
Thank you, guys.

12:01.613 --> 12:03.182
Thank you for being here.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.616
- Don't even give me that.
- I'm doing shots with them...

12:06.618 --> 12:08.218
I know. And look how you're...

12:08.220 --> 12:10.153
You're treating me
like a 12-year-old child.

12:10.155 --> 12:12.055
Is this why you quit your job?
Is this why,

12:12.057 --> 12:14.558
out of nowhere, you decide to up
and leave your job last week?

12:14.560 --> 12:16.627
- Why are you acting like this?
- We wake up every day,

12:16.629 --> 12:18.261
and we do the same thing.

12:18.263 --> 12:19.898
It's like we've been married
for fucking 30...

12:33.646 --> 12:36.046
Honey, are you okay?

12:36.048 --> 12:37.516
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:44.390 --> 12:47.991
I feel bad about not going,
but I... It's just so stre...

12:47.993 --> 12:49.593
I'm just trying
to stay super Zen

12:49.595 --> 12:51.528
- about everything right now...
- Yeah, yeah.

12:51.530 --> 12:53.096
and she really triggers me, so...

12:53.098 --> 12:54.498
You don't need that
in your life.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.434
The baby, and I know
that it's important.

12:57.436 --> 13:00.170
And then it's so confusing,
'cause then she's...

13:00.172 --> 13:02.272
really wonderful,
but then I almost don't believe

13:02.274 --> 13:05.509
the sincerity
of how wonderful she is.

13:05.511 --> 13:07.177
You know what?
It actually wasn't as bad

13:07.179 --> 13:09.980
as I thought it would be,
compared to other years.

13:09.982 --> 13:12.616
Sent you
into the lion's den alone.

13:12.618 --> 13:14.351
Are these going inside
or outside?

13:14.353 --> 13:15.519
These are gonna go outside.

13:15.521 --> 13:16.620
- All right...
- These ones are?

13:16.622 --> 13:18.188
let's start with these. Yeah.

13:39.511 --> 13:41.411
Have you guys ever seen
"Best in Show"?

13:41.413 --> 13:44.950
Like, the dog has never won,
like, toy, and they flip out.

14:08.507 --> 14:11.441
Hey, do you,
uh, got another one?

14:11.443 --> 14:12.478
Oh.

14:14.714 --> 14:15.748
Thank you.

14:18.116 --> 14:19.416
Happy new year.

14:20.586 --> 14:22.319
Happy new year.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.322
You ready?

14:24.590 --> 14:26.289
- You ready for the new year?
- I actually am.

14:26.291 --> 14:27.625
I'm very ready for the new year.

14:27.627 --> 14:29.627
- Really?
- Ready for this one to be done.

14:29.629 --> 14:32.464
That's good.
How do you know these people?

14:33.633 --> 14:35.131
Billie's my sister.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.100
Billie's your sister.
That's nice.

14:37.102 --> 14:39.236
- How do you know her?
- She seems like a nice person.

14:39.238 --> 14:40.638
I don't know her.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.608
Uh, no. I'm here
because a friend brought me.

14:44.610 --> 14:47.110
Uh, you know, and I didn't
have any New Year's plans.

14:47.112 --> 14:49.647
I was gonna sit at home
and watch "The Pianist,"

14:49.649 --> 14:52.549
but instead I decided that,
"You know what?

14:52.551 --> 14:55.385
People sounds like a good idea
for New Year's Eve,"

14:55.387 --> 14:57.122
so I'm here. Yeah.

14:58.691 --> 15:00.257
Where's your drink?

15:00.259 --> 15:02.292
Taking a little break.

15:02.294 --> 15:04.528
Probably why
I'm in a corner by myself.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.731
Yeah. I'll...

15:06.733 --> 15:08.701
I'll drink for you. How's that?

15:14.540 --> 15:16.676
Who are you hiding from
in that dress?

15:21.748 --> 15:23.748
All right, that's that.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.851
I just started to feel pain

15:26.853 --> 15:29.152
listening to myself
talk to you.

15:29.154 --> 15:30.788
No, that's because
you're in my suffer zone.

15:30.790 --> 15:32.657
- Is that what it is?
- That's what it is.

15:32.659 --> 15:35.726
Oh, dear God.
I never had a suffer zone.

15:37.496 --> 15:39.797
I mean,
I suffer everywhere, but...

15:39.799 --> 15:43.400
I would like to keep it
to a zone, if I could.

15:43.402 --> 15:44.804
Yeah, you should
probably leave now.

15:46.505 --> 15:48.505
- Oh, okay.
- Before I destroy you

15:48.507 --> 15:50.741
- with my radioactive sadness.
- But you already did.

15:52.277 --> 15:53.811
'Cause now I know you're here,

15:53.813 --> 15:55.746
so I have to deal
with that fact,

15:55.748 --> 15:59.251
but I guess I'll just try
and deal with it here.

16:00.653 --> 16:02.787
This is good, right?

16:02.789 --> 16:05.255
You're gonna have to move
another step. I'm sorry.

16:05.257 --> 16:06.759
It's still too close.

16:09.294 --> 16:10.830
Still too close.

16:29.949 --> 16:31.782
Good of you to come.

16:33.518 --> 16:35.552
All right, I'm gonna go die.

16:35.554 --> 16:37.422
- See you later.
- Cheers.

16:50.837 --> 16:51.836
Hi.

16:51.838 --> 16:54.304
Mm.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.438
- Daphne?
- Hi.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.874
- Daphne? Yeah.
- Yeah. Hi.

16:56.876 --> 16:58.608
- Jack.
- Yeah, how are you?

16:58.610 --> 17:00.276
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

17:00.278 --> 17:01.712
- How are you?
- I'm good.

17:01.714 --> 17:03.881
You're a... You're a writer.

17:03.883 --> 17:05.582
- I'm a writer, yes.
- You're a writer.

17:05.584 --> 17:07.685
- I'm a writer. That's good.
- I know. Okay. Hi.

17:07.687 --> 17:08.786
And you're an artist?

17:08.788 --> 17:09.987
Well, I'm not an artist.

17:09.989 --> 17:12.389
I work...
I work in the art world.

17:12.391 --> 17:13.425
Okay.

17:14.493 --> 17:16.226
Were you writing a book?

17:16.228 --> 17:18.597
I was writing a book.
Did you read my book?

17:19.932 --> 17:21.598
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.566
- What was it called?
- Yeah.

17:23.568 --> 17:25.301
"Great Book."

17:25.303 --> 17:27.570
- "The Great Book" by Jack...
- "The Great Book."

17:27.572 --> 17:28.973
- Yeah, "Great Book."
- Jack...

17:28.975 --> 17:31.776
Maybe, um,
it was by Nathanael West. Hmm?

17:31.778 --> 17:33.276
Yes. Yeah, I didn't...

17:33.278 --> 17:35.278
- I didn't read your book.
- Okay.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.814
But I remember hearing about it.

17:36.816 --> 17:38.883
I was about to ask you
why you're here,

17:38.885 --> 17:40.550
and then I remembered
you're Billie's sister.

17:40.552 --> 17:41.986
I'm sorry. That's so stupid.

17:41.988 --> 17:44.955
No, it's... I'm really here
because, like,

17:44.957 --> 17:46.957
I live in the pool house...

17:46.959 --> 17:49.392
- Oh, wow. Wow.
- currently.

17:49.394 --> 17:50.695
I should not have told you that.

17:50.697 --> 17:52.429
That's a really
embarrassing fact.

17:52.431 --> 17:54.297
- Now I know where you live.
- Why did I do that?

17:54.299 --> 17:56.332
Well, that's dangerous. We don't
know each other very well.

17:56.334 --> 17:57.768
I just admitted to you

17:57.770 --> 17:59.737
that I'm living
in my sister's pool house.

17:59.739 --> 18:02.405
That's fine.
What's wrong with that?

18:02.407 --> 18:04.441
I don't know.
What's wrong with that?

18:04.443 --> 18:05.976
- What's wrong with that?
- Everything is wrong with that.

18:05.978 --> 18:07.610
Unloading on you.

18:07.612 --> 18:10.215
That's... That's cool.
That's fine.

18:12.284 --> 18:13.351
Was it, um...

18:15.888 --> 18:18.725
I don't know. Was it unexpected?

18:19.726 --> 18:21.491
- The breakup?
- Yeah.

18:21.493 --> 18:23.293
I would give anything
to understand

18:23.295 --> 18:24.764
why I do things sometimes.

18:26.364 --> 18:28.933
- He was one of the "good ones."
- Okay.

18:28.935 --> 18:31.936
So that makes me,
I guess, the shitty one...

18:31.938 --> 18:33.938
- No, no, no, no.
- in the situation.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.706
I think everyone
feels like that.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.407
I think, like, everyone
is juggling with this idea

18:37.409 --> 18:39.576
of a bad person,
themselves a good person,

18:39.578 --> 18:41.879
"Some things I did right,
things I did wrong,"

18:41.881 --> 18:44.081
and then they're casting
variations of that

18:44.083 --> 18:45.716
on the people that they loved,

18:45.718 --> 18:47.550
and they have
totally different ideas

18:47.552 --> 18:49.086
of what they think
they did right

18:49.088 --> 18:50.755
and what they
think they did wrong.

18:50.757 --> 18:52.022
So...

18:52.024 --> 18:54.058
- You're such a writer.
- where...

18:54.060 --> 18:55.391
That's not...

18:55.393 --> 18:57.560
Yeah, yeah, okay.

18:57.562 --> 19:00.563
- That...
- 9, 8...

19:00.565 --> 19:02.599
- Here we go.
- 7, 6,

19:02.601 --> 19:05.669
5, 4, 3...

19:05.671 --> 19:07.705
2, 1...

19:07.707 --> 19:09.606
happy new year!

19:09.608 --> 19:11.976
- Happy new year.
- Another?

19:11.978 --> 19:15.946
Another.
Another revamp on my life.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.082
Okay. Happy new year.

19:18.084 --> 19:19.384
Happy new year.

19:31.998 --> 19:33.864
Want some Thai food?

19:33.866 --> 19:36.967
Thai food? That's great.

19:36.969 --> 19:39.005
- Thai food's great.
- Isn't it?

19:41.473 --> 19:43.341
It's more like ramen.

19:44.744 --> 19:46.844
I'm a good dancer.

19:46.846 --> 19:48.611
What is it, skill?

19:52.885 --> 19:53.884
Oh, yeah.

19:53.886 --> 19:55.552
It's definitely...

19:55.554 --> 19:57.355
Oh, that's good.

20:13.072 --> 20:14.905
...for the reception.

20:14.907 --> 20:17.473
Is it? What is it like?

20:19.679 --> 20:23.180
All right, you're
gonna look, like, right in here.

20:34.694 --> 20:36.160
Go get me an extra plate.

20:36.162 --> 20:37.962
- Another, please.
- Oh, did I grab them all?

20:37.964 --> 20:40.530
Sorry about that. I'm like,
"There's finally none."

20:43.736 --> 20:45.769
What are you looking for?

20:54.680 --> 20:57.081
- Huh?
- Happy new year.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.481
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:58.483 --> 21:00.452
- Aunt Daphne!
- Hi, sweetie.

22:57.837 --> 23:00.704
Do you think Ingrid will notice
if I end up just stealing

23:00.706 --> 23:03.340
half the clothing items
that are in here?

23:03.342 --> 23:04.975
I won't tell.

23:04.977 --> 23:06.677
Have you always worked here?

23:06.679 --> 23:08.779
Does that work,
like, in your relationship...

23:08.781 --> 23:10.981
- I mean...
- to be together all the time?

23:10.983 --> 23:12.816
I'm not getting paid.

23:12.818 --> 23:16.153
So is that work,
or is that donation-based?

23:16.155 --> 23:18.188
I think that's called love.

23:18.190 --> 23:20.657
- Yeah, I just help out a little.
- Or leashed. It's one of them.

23:20.659 --> 23:22.860
Love or a leash?
Nothing like that.

23:33.372 --> 23:35.239
I'm actually planning
a trip to Ireland.

23:35.241 --> 23:37.007
I was wondering
if you had anything green

23:37.009 --> 23:39.276
that I could wear
to make me fit in.

23:39.278 --> 23:40.277
Hi.

23:40.279 --> 23:41.313
Hi.

23:43.249 --> 23:45.082
- Yeah.
- Just... Just casually shopping

23:45.084 --> 23:47.284
on a... on a weekday afternoon?

23:47.286 --> 23:49.720
- Yeah, I am. I can do that.
- Do you not have a job?

23:49.722 --> 23:51.221
- I can do that.
- Are you just...

23:51.223 --> 23:53.257
You know, I'm a professor,

23:53.259 --> 23:55.259
so I can kind of do
what I want a little bit.

23:55.261 --> 23:57.327
- Yeah. That's good.
- Yeah.

23:57.329 --> 23:59.263
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

23:59.265 --> 24:00.864
Yeah, I kind of was.

24:00.866 --> 24:03.667
I asked Billie where you worked,
and she told me.

24:03.669 --> 24:05.636
Fucking Billie.

24:05.638 --> 24:06.804
Yeah.

24:06.806 --> 24:08.974
I thought we should get a drink.

24:10.042 --> 24:11.075
I'm not drinking.

24:11.077 --> 24:13.310
- I know.
- Okay.

24:13.312 --> 24:16.313
I thought... I thought
you could watch me drink.

24:16.315 --> 24:17.748
Oh, that sounds so fun.

24:17.750 --> 24:18.782
Yeah.

24:18.784 --> 24:20.217
You know, you can have a...

24:20.219 --> 24:22.019
a virgin tequila and soda.
They have that.

24:22.021 --> 24:23.687
A soda water?

24:23.689 --> 24:25.823
That's a so...
Yeah, take the tequila away,

24:25.825 --> 24:27.357
that's a soda water. Yeah.

24:27.359 --> 24:30.360
Do you want to have a soda water
and watch me drink?

24:30.362 --> 24:31.395
Um...

24:31.397 --> 24:32.996
My treat.

24:32.998 --> 24:34.865
Yeah. God, I mean,
absolutely. I...

24:34.867 --> 24:36.834
- Okay.
- would have to...

24:36.836 --> 24:38.969
- Just friends.
- Yes. Yeah.

24:38.971 --> 24:40.671
Okay. Yeah, of course.

24:40.673 --> 24:42.306
Yeah. Good.

24:42.308 --> 24:43.674
- Great.
- Right.

24:43.676 --> 24:44.875
All right.

24:44.877 --> 24:46.310
- Good to see you.
- And you.

24:46.312 --> 24:47.411
- See you soon.
- See you later.

24:47.413 --> 24:48.948
See you later.

24:56.088 --> 24:57.123
I think he likes you.

24:59.258 --> 25:01.225
No.

25:01.227 --> 25:03.794
Do not, please.

25:03.796 --> 25:06.163
Do not tell Ingrid
that that just happened.

25:06.165 --> 25:07.800
My lips are sealed.

25:17.209 --> 25:18.709
One sec. Sorry.

25:18.711 --> 25:19.877
That's all right.
Is it important?

25:19.879 --> 25:20.878
You can take it.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.047
No, no.

25:23.382 --> 25:26.016
I'm turning it off.
There you go.

25:26.018 --> 25:27.951
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:27.953 --> 25:30.053
Just wanted to hang out?

25:32.158 --> 25:34.057
Yeah. I don't know.

25:34.059 --> 25:35.094
I felt like...

25:36.896 --> 25:38.328
you know, I just...
I don't know.

25:38.330 --> 25:42.065
I don't know why.
I just wanted to see you, and...

25:42.067 --> 25:43.734
I feel like you're something

25:43.736 --> 25:47.004
a little bit different
to other people,

25:47.006 --> 25:49.175
and I wanted
good conversation and...

25:50.910 --> 25:52.109
You know what?
If you, like,

25:52.111 --> 25:53.477
stole a teenager's notebook,

25:53.479 --> 25:55.112
- opened it up...
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

25:55.114 --> 25:57.748
and add, like,
a little bit of form to it,

25:57.750 --> 25:59.216
that's... that's
what my art looks like.

25:59.218 --> 26:00.350
That sounds cool.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.085
No, it's really not that great.

26:02.087 --> 26:03.754
That sounds really cool.
I want to see it.

26:03.756 --> 26:05.222
Do you have any?

26:05.224 --> 26:07.858
I don't even know
what I would have to show you.

26:07.860 --> 26:10.194
Um, oh, you know what?

26:10.196 --> 26:11.395
I have an Etsy shop.

26:11.397 --> 26:13.096
- You do?
- I do.

26:13.098 --> 26:15.799
I-I used to be really into it.

26:15.801 --> 26:18.902
I'd buy, like,
old ceramic teapots and plates

26:18.904 --> 26:20.103
and then paint on.

26:20.105 --> 26:22.406
- This is amazing.
- Oh, come on.

26:22.408 --> 26:24.174
No, this is really great.

26:24.176 --> 26:26.011
It's fine. It's fine.

26:27.046 --> 26:28.512
No, I love it.

26:28.514 --> 26:31.014
- Okay.
- This stuff, this is great.

26:31.016 --> 26:32.950
Thank you.

26:32.952 --> 26:35.018
I don't feel guilty
that I'm not married.

26:35.020 --> 26:37.020
Don't feel guilty
that I don't have kids.

26:37.022 --> 26:39.523
I don't feel guilty
that maybe I don't want kids.

26:39.525 --> 26:42.459
You know, people put
so much pressure

26:42.461 --> 26:44.261
on that shit these days,
and it's like...

26:44.263 --> 26:47.231
- everyone's on their own path.
- Mm.

26:47.233 --> 26:49.900
Doesn't mean that...
that we're less adult.

26:49.902 --> 26:52.236
Maybe I-I'm jaded,
and I don't feel like there is

26:52.238 --> 26:55.505
a world that exists
where you can have that fire

26:55.507 --> 26:58.308
and have that comfort
at the same time.

26:58.310 --> 27:00.877
You know, I like the kind
of liberties that I have.

27:00.879 --> 27:04.448
I like that I'm not beholden
to some person.

27:04.450 --> 27:06.483
I like
that I don't have to wake up

27:06.485 --> 27:08.318
in the middle of the night.
And who knows what...

27:08.320 --> 27:12.923
I'm at this very,
very weird stage in my life

27:12.925 --> 27:16.393
where I feel like... Lighter.

27:16.395 --> 27:18.195
Stick around for this one.

27:18.197 --> 27:22.032
Um, I feel like I'm in a place
where all I want to do

27:22.034 --> 27:24.534
is do the things that I should
have done in my early 20s,

27:24.536 --> 27:27.871
like travel the world
and explore new culture

27:27.873 --> 27:30.507
or maybe join the Peace Corps
or... Yeah.

27:30.509 --> 27:35.180
I think there's something
really important about...

27:36.615 --> 27:39.016
doing shit for others,

27:39.018 --> 27:41.453
and I don't really know
what that looks like, but...

27:42.855 --> 27:44.089
that's the phase I'm in.

27:46.158 --> 27:48.325
I really want to talk
much more about this...

27:48.327 --> 27:50.060
- Okay.
- but I need to pee.

27:50.062 --> 27:51.561
- Okay. Go pee.
- You gonna be okay without me?

27:51.563 --> 27:52.896
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:52.898 --> 27:54.333
- I'll survive.
- Okay.

28:50.989 --> 28:52.157
- Hi.
- Hello.

28:53.158 --> 28:54.224
Thank you.

28:54.226 --> 28:55.525
You're welcome.

28:55.527 --> 28:57.129
- Take care.
- Yeah, you, too.

30:19.411 --> 30:21.077
Hi.

30:21.079 --> 30:22.114
Hi.

30:27.419 --> 30:29.286
Do you want a drink?

30:29.288 --> 30:31.423
Can I get
a glass of water, please?

30:32.725 --> 30:35.425
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

30:35.427 --> 30:36.761
Still holding strong.

30:36.763 --> 30:38.197
Standing strong.

30:39.298 --> 30:41.465
Thank you. What's going on?

30:41.467 --> 30:43.168
I should be asking you that.

30:47.473 --> 30:49.406
I don't know what that means.

30:49.408 --> 30:50.708
No?

30:50.710 --> 30:53.210
No. Should I?

30:53.212 --> 30:54.745
I don't know. You're...

30:54.747 --> 30:57.180
You're kinda killing me.

30:57.182 --> 30:58.448
What are you talking about?

30:58.450 --> 31:00.350
You are.
You're making me all crazy.

31:00.352 --> 31:03.153
I'm jealous. It's working,
whatever you're doing.

31:03.155 --> 31:04.490
It's like...

31:07.559 --> 31:09.662
A little bit confused right now.

31:12.799 --> 31:14.397
My friend is Jack.

31:14.399 --> 31:15.733
He brought me
to the New Year's party.

31:15.735 --> 31:17.467
- Oh.
- Yeah.

31:17.469 --> 31:18.836
Okay. Jack's your friend.

31:18.838 --> 31:21.104
Yeah, he's my friend.

31:21.106 --> 31:22.474
I didn't know that.

31:23.542 --> 31:25.075
Sorry.

31:25.077 --> 31:26.811
You know what? I'm...
I should not be

31:26.813 --> 31:30.080
fucking talking to either
of you, to be honest.

31:30.082 --> 31:33.216
I'm trying to stay away
from men and alcohol

31:33.218 --> 31:35.085
and everything else in my life.

31:35.087 --> 31:37.287
Probably shouldn't have even
gone on a date with Jack.

31:37.289 --> 31:40.357
Yeah, but you're not really
doing a good job of that,

31:40.359 --> 31:42.192
so let's just move on
to the next thing.

31:42.194 --> 31:43.861
No, I'm not doing
a good job of that.

31:43.863 --> 31:46.231
Um, here's the thing.

31:51.203 --> 31:54.705
I love Jack,
and I'm not gonna, you know,

31:54.707 --> 31:57.708
do anything to fuck him over.
I just can't.

31:57.710 --> 31:59.644
- Yeah.
- You understand.

31:59.646 --> 32:01.545
Of course.

32:01.547 --> 32:05.650
I don't need to be a-a wedge
in your friendship at all.

32:05.652 --> 32:06.686
Nah.

32:09.321 --> 32:10.522
It's gonna be all right.

32:11.724 --> 32:12.825
And I don't...

32:14.526 --> 32:16.426
I don't wanna deal with it,
but I... but I do.

32:16.428 --> 32:18.330
I gotta deal with the fact
that now I know you.

32:19.398 --> 32:20.731
Well, you don't really know me.

32:20.733 --> 32:22.334
Doesn't matter.
I know you enough.

32:24.136 --> 32:25.237
Okay.

32:38.550 --> 32:40.485
So I should go.

32:41.788 --> 32:43.856
Yeah, you should...
you should probably go.

32:46.659 --> 32:48.527
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:50.262 --> 32:51.296
Bye.

32:54.399 --> 32:57.233
Bye.

32:57.235 --> 32:58.270
Bye.

33:01.373 --> 33:02.940
Thanks for the water.

33:02.942 --> 33:03.941
You're welcome.

33:03.943 --> 33:06.846
For the clarification.

33:11.283 --> 33:13.283
Thanks for coming.

33:13.285 --> 33:15.520
Yeah, I guess that's...
that's it, huh?

33:17.356 --> 33:18.423
Goodbye.

33:20.459 --> 33:22.325
Hope everything works out.

33:22.327 --> 33:24.527
Yeah. No, it will.
It'll be great.

33:34.539 --> 33:35.640
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:35.642 --> 33:37.476
- Um...
- Bye.

33:39.912 --> 33:41.114
Yeah.

34:25.490 --> 34:26.558
No, thank you.

35:29.088 --> 35:30.555
Are you okay?

35:33.926 --> 35:35.726
Yeah.

35:35.728 --> 35:37.494
Yeah.

35:37.496 --> 35:38.865
Okay.

35:58.117 --> 35:59.852
Let me feel you.

36:33.753 --> 36:35.119
Where you going?

36:35.121 --> 36:37.721
There's this thing
I do with my friends.

36:37.723 --> 36:39.123
It's called Still Life Club.

36:39.125 --> 36:40.891
We just, like,
get together and paint

36:40.893 --> 36:43.127
and, I don't know,
talk about life.

36:43.129 --> 36:44.695
I really gotta go.

36:44.697 --> 36:46.664
And it's... get together
all the time?

36:46.666 --> 36:48.098
- Yeah, all the time.
- And then what happens?

36:48.100 --> 36:49.633
Then we talk.

36:49.635 --> 36:50.968
All right,
so can I come with you?

36:50.970 --> 36:52.736
No.

36:52.738 --> 36:55.072
I'm not getting off this floor
until you come back.

36:55.074 --> 36:56.941
I'm just letting you know.
I'm staying right here.

36:56.943 --> 36:59.011
You might be here
for a very long time.

37:03.149 --> 37:04.917
Well, I'm serious.

37:08.988 --> 37:12.422
How's the six-month
sabbatical going?

37:12.424 --> 37:14.359
Um...

37:18.898 --> 37:20.798
It, uh... it went.

37:21.968 --> 37:25.035
And it went well when it went.

37:25.037 --> 37:27.004
- Um...
- Jeez.

37:27.006 --> 37:29.874
Okay, you definitely
owe me 20 bucks, Ingrid.

37:29.876 --> 37:31.809
Oh, shut up.

37:31.811 --> 37:32.979
You guys bet on it?

37:34.046 --> 37:36.446
Yeah. I've, uh...

37:36.448 --> 37:38.215
But it's a good thing.
It's a good thing. I'm...

37:38.217 --> 37:43.486
I'm really mindful
of the dynamics at play.

37:43.488 --> 37:44.755
That's actually not true at all.

37:44.757 --> 37:46.757
I'm fucking...

37:46.759 --> 37:48.524
I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing.

37:48.526 --> 37:50.060
- We're done talking about me.
- No.

37:50.062 --> 37:51.996
I just came in here
and stole the show.

37:51.998 --> 37:55.132
What's happening with Roxanne?
What's going on with Graham?

37:55.134 --> 37:58.102
I'm still taking in
what you're...

37:58.104 --> 38:00.938
The whole point was
to change up the pattern, Daph.

38:00.940 --> 38:03.073
It didn't... it didn't
feel right being alone.

38:03.075 --> 38:06.043
It didn't feel right
not exploring

38:06.045 --> 38:08.611
- both of these people, you know?
- Okay.

38:08.613 --> 38:11.481
All right. Well, there you go.

38:11.483 --> 38:12.852
Yeah. We'll see.

38:54.126 --> 38:56.594
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

39:52.885 --> 39:54.218
Hi.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.020
Who are you?

39:56.022 --> 39:57.721
Bart coming to say hello.

39:57.723 --> 39:59.256
You look a lot like your Dad.

39:59.258 --> 40:00.991
Oh, yeah.

40:02.161 --> 40:03.360
- What's his name?
- What is it?

40:03.362 --> 40:04.661
Bart.

40:04.663 --> 40:06.030
- Bart.
- Bartholomew.

40:06.032 --> 40:09.233
Ooh, Bartholomew. You're fancy.

40:09.235 --> 40:11.170
Ah, this is your book.

40:12.138 --> 40:13.370
Yeah.

40:13.372 --> 40:15.172
You have so many copies of it.

40:15.174 --> 40:16.707
Oh, they're
in different languages.

40:16.709 --> 40:19.676
Bart looks terrified
in this picture.

40:19.678 --> 40:22.646
No, no, no, no. That's...
That's the look of love.

40:22.648 --> 40:24.148
No, it... he looks terrified.

40:24.150 --> 40:26.150
That's love.

40:26.152 --> 40:27.953
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:29.121 --> 40:30.788
No alcohol.

40:30.790 --> 40:32.656
- Uh, you know what?
- Mm-hmm?

40:32.658 --> 40:35.025
I, um... I fell off the wagon.

40:35.027 --> 40:37.061
You did?

40:37.063 --> 40:39.229
- I did.
- That's okay.

40:39.231 --> 40:41.231
I mean, life's short, right?

40:41.233 --> 40:43.202
- I agree.
- Fuck it.

40:45.337 --> 40:46.939
To falling off the wagon.

40:57.083 --> 41:00.953
I must have smoked 40 cigarettes
with you in two nights.

41:01.921 --> 41:02.986
Sorry.

41:02.988 --> 41:03.989
I don't usually smoke this much.

41:05.958 --> 41:09.860
If we spend more time together,
one of us'll die.

41:09.862 --> 41:13.030
How's your job search going?

41:13.032 --> 41:14.731
That's what I wanna know.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.800
Oh, God.

41:16.802 --> 41:19.369
Ask my sister.

41:19.371 --> 41:21.138
It's not going well at all.

41:21.140 --> 41:23.073
Does she want you out?

41:23.075 --> 41:25.911
Probably,
but I don't wanna leave.

41:28.848 --> 41:32.749
I feel like I gotta...

41:32.751 --> 41:34.320
talk to you about...

41:36.155 --> 41:37.855
whatever. Frank?

41:37.857 --> 41:40.457
Your... your relationship
with him, the...

41:40.459 --> 41:42.092
Mm-hmm.

41:42.094 --> 41:43.927
And I didn't know
that you guys were friends.

41:43.929 --> 41:46.165
- Okay.
- Um...

41:47.199 --> 41:48.932
What do you wanna know?

41:48.934 --> 41:52.002
I don't know.
I guess just the situation,

41:52.004 --> 41:53.737
- how you met.
- Okay.

41:53.739 --> 41:55.272
Uh, if...

41:55.274 --> 41:59.910
I didn't... Yeah, I just
wanna respect you and him

41:59.912 --> 42:03.780
and don't wanna blur any lines.

42:03.782 --> 42:05.149
Okay.

42:05.151 --> 42:07.251
Frank's one
of my oldest friends.

42:07.253 --> 42:10.053
I met him 17 years ago
when I moved here.

42:10.055 --> 42:12.890
You know,
he's one of those people,

42:12.892 --> 42:15.259
he's the life and soul
of every party, he's so fun,

42:15.261 --> 42:18.764
and you need him around
most of the time, but then...

42:21.000 --> 42:21.999
Hmm?

42:22.001 --> 42:23.135
Then, you know...

42:25.237 --> 42:26.272
What?

42:28.440 --> 42:29.907
He's unreliable.

42:29.909 --> 42:30.908
He's volatile.

42:30.910 --> 42:32.943
He can be messy.

42:32.945 --> 42:35.014
He owes me money.

42:37.783 --> 42:39.483
But...

42:39.485 --> 42:41.151
I love him.

42:41.153 --> 42:42.922
I really do. I fucking love him.

42:44.757 --> 42:46.490
I feel like
the last girlfriend he had,

42:46.492 --> 42:48.325
she kind of drowned in him.

42:48.327 --> 42:50.994
She drowned in him?

42:50.996 --> 42:54.364
Yeah. I realize now that's
quite a weird way of putting it.

42:54.366 --> 42:56.099
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

42:56.101 --> 42:57.870
If you knew Frank,
you'd understand.

43:02.241 --> 43:04.508
We were together
for three years.

43:04.510 --> 43:06.310
We traveled everywhere together.

43:06.312 --> 43:09.413
We were in Senegal.
We lived in Paris for a summer.

43:09.415 --> 43:12.182
She did a research fellowship
in Amsterdam.

43:12.184 --> 43:14.017
I went to see her
all the fucking time,

43:14.019 --> 43:16.420
and then we moved in together.

43:16.422 --> 43:18.789
I was there six months.

43:18.791 --> 43:20.157
We'd killed it.

43:20.159 --> 43:21.293
What happened?

43:24.496 --> 43:26.230
Do you really wanna know?

43:26.232 --> 43:27.333
I do, yeah.

43:29.902 --> 43:35.138
Uh, I saw
some of her used dental floss

43:35.140 --> 43:36.940
on the side of the sink
in the bathroom,

43:36.942 --> 43:38.575
and that was it.
It was the nail in the coffin.

43:38.577 --> 43:39.876
I couldn't even look at her.

43:39.878 --> 43:42.045
I know exactly what you mean.

43:42.047 --> 43:44.149
- You do?
- I do. I do.

44:07.306 --> 44:08.472
Fuck.

44:08.474 --> 44:09.908
We can't.

44:16.315 --> 44:17.383
Ah, fuck.

44:20.452 --> 44:22.085
Sorry.

44:22.087 --> 44:24.254
- That's okay.
- I didn't know where to go.

44:34.933 --> 44:38.435
I'm gonna wash off
some of these potential kids.

44:38.437 --> 44:40.203
Oh, creepy.

44:40.205 --> 44:42.105
- Huh?
- Creepy.

44:42.107 --> 44:45.175
Sorry.

44:49.515 --> 44:50.914
Yeah? What'd you learn?

44:50.916 --> 44:52.149
About colors.

44:52.151 --> 44:53.984
- Ooh, you got to color?
- Yeah.

44:53.986 --> 44:55.919
- That's pretty cool.
- I drawed...

44:55.921 --> 44:58.188
Oh, can I have ice cream?

44:58.190 --> 44:59.923
Yeah, but it's
really close to dinner,

44:59.925 --> 45:01.958
so you have to promise me
not to tell your Mom.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.427
- I won't. Promise.
- Okay.

45:03.429 --> 45:04.895
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:04.897 --> 45:07.130
- How much is it?
- Uh, $5.00.

45:07.132 --> 45:08.932
- One scoop?
- Uh, yeah.

45:08.934 --> 45:10.600
- All right.
- We'll just do...

45:10.602 --> 45:12.035
- Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

45:12.037 --> 45:14.271
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.

45:14.273 --> 45:15.605
What about your ice cream?

45:15.607 --> 45:16.875
What's that?

45:18.043 --> 45:19.378
Wait. What?!

45:21.547 --> 45:23.849
That was a great time at school.

45:31.457 --> 45:33.190
Whoa. No.

45:33.192 --> 45:35.092
Your sister living there
for God knows how long!

45:35.094 --> 45:36.993
What does that
have to do with anything?!

45:36.995 --> 45:38.929
The fact that she can slack off
while I'm working every...

45:38.931 --> 45:40.430
Hey, you want to go paint?

45:40.432 --> 45:42.032
- Shall we go paint? Come on.
- Okay.

45:42.034 --> 45:43.634
Let's go make some...
Let's go make

45:43.636 --> 45:45.871
something for Mommy and Daddy.

45:48.140 --> 45:50.240
Well, that's nice.

45:50.242 --> 45:52.677
Was this yours? Your mother's?

45:52.679 --> 45:54.411
Was my mother's.

45:54.413 --> 45:56.681
Was not really
a wedding ring, anyway.

45:56.683 --> 45:59.082
Was more of a token
of my Dad's guilt.

45:59.084 --> 46:00.552
He had another family.

46:03.021 --> 46:04.490
You sure you wanna sell it?

46:11.196 --> 46:12.464
Yeah, I'm sure.

46:29.148 --> 46:30.182
Thanks.

46:32.151 --> 46:33.552
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

46:51.103 --> 46:53.738
"D. One day,
you'll discover this note

46:53.740 --> 46:55.107
when you least expect it.

46:57.176 --> 46:58.643
And I hope you'll take a minute

46:58.645 --> 47:00.546
and remember
who we were together...

47:03.182 --> 47:05.382
We found each other
in this life,

47:05.384 --> 47:07.687
and we'll find each other
in the next.

47:11.323 --> 47:12.357
Love, A."

47:21.801 --> 47:23.734
Thanks again so much.

47:23.736 --> 47:25.736
- Anytime.
- See you soon.

47:25.738 --> 47:27.537
- All right.
- Get home safe.

47:27.539 --> 47:29.306
- Thanks.
- Bye.

47:56.568 --> 47:57.702
Hey, stranger.

47:57.704 --> 48:00.070
Uh, we miss you at work.

48:00.072 --> 48:01.806
Wish you hadn't left us.

48:01.808 --> 48:05.242
Um, I hope it has nothing
to do with that night.

48:05.244 --> 48:07.210
You and I were wasted.

48:07.212 --> 48:08.578
It was fun, though.

48:08.580 --> 48:10.347
Don't worry.
I-I didn't tell anyone.

48:10.349 --> 48:12.817
I know it's weird
since I'm your boss.

48:12.819 --> 48:14.752
Don't want you
to be embarrassed.

48:14.754 --> 48:17.153
Anyway, um...

48:26.431 --> 48:29.165
- Adriana's?
- Mm.

48:29.167 --> 48:31.468
I have not
been paying attention.

48:31.470 --> 48:34.805
I can tell that you
weren't paying attention.

48:34.807 --> 48:37.407
- I, however...
- You're so distracting.

48:37.409 --> 48:38.643
I know everything
that's happening.

48:38.645 --> 48:40.243
What's happening?

48:40.245 --> 48:44.614
They are on this holiday,

48:44.616 --> 48:47.384
trying to make shit right, but...

48:47.386 --> 48:48.719
You're completely
making this up, huh?

48:50.690 --> 48:53.356
Why don't we
just cover the subtitles?

48:53.358 --> 48:54.692
We can just make our own film.

48:54.694 --> 48:56.192
Okay.

48:56.194 --> 48:57.193
You be him.

48:57.195 --> 48:58.497
No, you be him.

48:59.464 --> 49:00.631
Gloria!

49:02.401 --> 49:04.301
You're her. You're her.

49:04.303 --> 49:05.502
Oh, shit. Yeah, Juan,

49:05.504 --> 49:06.637
stop fucking calling my name.

49:06.639 --> 49:08.338
I'm not called Gloria.

49:08.340 --> 49:10.407
Oh. What's your name again?

49:10.409 --> 49:12.442
- Stephanie.
- Oh, fuck.

49:12.444 --> 49:13.678
That's right, Steph.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.414
- Who the fuck's Gloria?
- Stephie.

49:17.784 --> 49:19.583
Mm. Indian food on my face?

49:19.585 --> 49:20.918
There was Indian food
on your face.

49:20.920 --> 49:23.186
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

49:23.188 --> 49:28.759
There's just an openness
when it comes to relationships

49:28.761 --> 49:32.262
that I think Americans
don't tend to have

49:32.264 --> 49:34.464
- or they're scared of.
- Mm-hmm.

49:34.466 --> 49:37.334
Where you can have, like,
the whole "Father of the Bri..."

49:37.336 --> 49:39.469
Have you seen that movie,
"Father of the Bride"?

49:39.471 --> 49:41.338
Yeah, I've seen
"Father of the Bride."

49:41.340 --> 49:42.740
- Steve Martin.
- Yeah.

49:42.742 --> 49:44.675
But the idea
of having a big family

49:44.677 --> 49:46.711
and people to take care of you
and look out for you

49:46.713 --> 49:49.514
and all of that is so appealing.

49:50.449 --> 49:52.783
So appealing, but then...

49:52.785 --> 49:54.852
- this passion...
- Mm-hmm.

49:54.854 --> 49:58.455
I feel like that gets lost
in the sidelines

49:58.457 --> 49:59.556
when you have the...

50:07.700 --> 50:09.334
I mean, it blows my mind.

50:11.370 --> 50:13.338
I think
that's what makes you amazing.

50:17.744 --> 50:19.376
You're great.

50:19.378 --> 50:21.580
You know that?

50:23.683 --> 50:24.717
You're great.

51:52.872 --> 51:53.838
- Jesus Christ.
- Aww.

51:55.808 --> 51:57.375
Fucking cardigan.

51:59.779 --> 52:02.847
So I'm thinking that I
should have a dinner party

52:02.849 --> 52:04.514
before I go to Philadelphia
next week.

52:04.516 --> 52:06.016
That's a great idea.

52:06.018 --> 52:08.986
Um, do you think it's weird
if I invite Frank?

52:08.988 --> 52:12.322
It's kind of awkward if I don't,
because he's looking after Bart.

52:12.324 --> 52:13.726
Well, I can look after Bart.

52:14.961 --> 52:17.393
Mm. Frank likes doing it.

52:17.395 --> 52:18.963
I'll just stay here. I mean,

52:18.965 --> 52:21.531
I'd take him to my apartment,
but no-pet policy.

52:21.533 --> 52:23.868
Frank actually uses Bart
to pick up girls in the park,

52:23.870 --> 52:25.604
so I think
he's gonna be pretty happy.

52:31.110 --> 52:33.345
Anything else happen
with you two that night?

52:36.949 --> 52:37.984
No.

52:41.586 --> 52:45.421
You guys
don't still talk or text?

52:45.423 --> 52:46.726
No.

52:55.001 --> 52:56.466
You wanna do it?

52:56.468 --> 52:57.835
No, go for it.
I have feta hands.

52:57.837 --> 52:58.869
Okay.

52:58.871 --> 53:00.771
Yeah.

53:00.773 --> 53:03.007
Whew.

53:03.009 --> 53:05.441
- Okay, let's eat.
- Please.

53:08.748 --> 53:10.848
It all looks great.
That's like a thing right now.

53:10.850 --> 53:12.149
I was screwed.

53:12.151 --> 53:13.984
I had a smoking mommy
and a sugar dad.

53:13.986 --> 53:15.054
There was no love.

53:19.926 --> 53:21.826
Wait. You guys are sisters,
right?

53:21.828 --> 53:23.727
We're half... we're halfsies.

53:23.729 --> 53:25.562
- We're sisters. We're sisters.
- We're sisters.

53:25.564 --> 53:27.765
We have the same Mom,
but different Dads.

53:27.767 --> 53:29.033
I can see
the similarities.

53:30.970 --> 53:32.602
She's funnier.

53:34.140 --> 53:35.906
Actually,
we're gonna build a hot tub.

53:35.908 --> 53:38.408
When we're ready,
we're gonna build a hot tub.

53:55.027 --> 53:57.628
Open your eyes, everyone.

53:57.630 --> 53:59.964
- Aww.
- Aww.

53:59.966 --> 54:02.733
Somebody was murdered.

54:02.735 --> 54:04.500
- What?
- Massacred.

54:04.502 --> 54:06.036
- What?!
- Slain...

54:06.038 --> 54:08.672
in the middle of the night.
Good night, my dear.

54:08.674 --> 54:10.975
- No!
- What?!

54:10.977 --> 54:12.977
- Daphne, are you dead?
- Did you kill me?

54:12.979 --> 54:14.912
- Daphne, you're gone.
- You'll never know.

54:14.914 --> 54:16.881
- She's gone.
- Who killed me?

54:16.883 --> 54:20.718
Okay, do we want to nominate
who we think might be Mafia?

54:20.720 --> 54:22.485
It's the guy
dressed in all black.

54:22.487 --> 54:24.621
- R-Really?
- Is it you?

54:24.623 --> 54:26.090
Yeah. You look like a Mafia guy.

54:26.092 --> 54:27.858
- Are you Mafia?
- That's not...

54:27.860 --> 54:30.628
I've been very helpful,
I'd say, this entire game,

54:30.630 --> 54:33.097
pointing at people.
Yes, I have.

54:33.099 --> 54:36.734
Do we want
to kill him or save him?

54:36.736 --> 54:38.969
- Kill him.
- He's Mafia.

54:38.971 --> 54:41.205
- That's one, two, three, four...
- Jonathan.

54:41.207 --> 54:44.708
five, six.
Wow, a lot of suspicion.

54:44.710 --> 54:45.776
He was...

54:45.778 --> 54:46.844
a townsperson.

54:46.846 --> 54:49.612
- No!
- No!

54:49.614 --> 54:51.882
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Aw, it's all good.

54:51.884 --> 54:53.250
- Plot twist.
- Sorry.

54:53.252 --> 54:54.752
Everyone, close your eyes.

54:54.754 --> 54:56.588
It's what it is, you know?

55:02.862 --> 55:04.560
- Mafia...
- Hmm?

55:04.562 --> 55:07.033
you dirty devils, wake up.

55:10.670 --> 55:12.038
Who would you like to kill?

55:17.910 --> 55:20.543
Good morning.

55:20.545 --> 55:22.212
Everyone wake up.

55:22.214 --> 55:24.949
I'm so sorry
we have another death

55:24.951 --> 55:26.616
in the middle of the night.

55:27.787 --> 55:29.019
I'm so sorry.

55:29.021 --> 55:30.187
Karma's a bitch.

55:30.189 --> 55:32.656
- There is...
- I'm so sorry.

55:32.658 --> 55:34.959
a baby inside of my body.

55:34.961 --> 55:36.293
We'll take it out. Don't worry.

55:36.295 --> 55:37.761
We had two murders.

55:37.763 --> 55:40.998
You horrifying humans.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.133
Ah, dude, good to see you, man.

55:43.135 --> 55:45.202
Thank you, man.
Thank you for having us.

55:45.204 --> 55:47.271
Drive safe, okay?

55:47.273 --> 55:49.006
Bye.

55:50.643 --> 55:52.076
Yeah,
that's definitely that guy.

55:54.013 --> 55:57.014
Do people actually buy photos
of other people at garage sales?

55:57.016 --> 55:59.083
I wonder if he knows
that these are even in here.

55:59.085 --> 56:00.718
This would look cute
over your belly.

56:00.720 --> 56:02.686
- You think? Ooh, elastic.
- In a little while.

56:02.688 --> 56:03.854
It's gonna keep growing
and growing.

56:03.856 --> 56:04.989
That's cute.

56:04.991 --> 56:06.556
And also
do a little bit of this.

56:06.558 --> 56:07.958
Ah, there you go.

56:07.960 --> 56:10.593
You guys missing me
in your pool house?

56:10.595 --> 56:11.962
Shut up.

56:11.964 --> 56:14.231
So what's happening?

56:14.233 --> 56:16.033
Nothing. Everything.

56:16.035 --> 56:17.301
Look, you're never gonna find

56:17.303 --> 56:18.802
the person
that gives it all to you,

56:18.804 --> 56:20.237
so you just have
to find the person

56:20.239 --> 56:22.074
that gives you enough of it.

56:24.110 --> 56:26.310
What if you find two people

56:26.312 --> 56:29.747
that give you
two different sides of it?

56:29.749 --> 56:32.615
Yeah. Do you
see your future in there?

56:32.617 --> 56:34.284
Whose face do you see?

56:34.286 --> 56:36.120
I just see a bunch of skulls.

56:36.122 --> 56:40.290
Do you see Frank's huge penis
in that kaleidoscope?

56:43.595 --> 56:45.231
Oh, God.

56:46.332 --> 56:48.799
I feel like maybe
Adrian was the one

56:48.801 --> 56:52.838
and I should have
just stuck it out and...

56:54.306 --> 56:55.540
I don't know.

57:11.623 --> 57:12.856
Hi.

57:12.858 --> 57:16.627
Hi. How you doing?

57:16.629 --> 57:17.997
Good. I'm just...

57:19.165 --> 57:22.933
painting Billie's
baby shower gift.

57:22.935 --> 57:26.370
That's 100% the most beautiful
teapot I've ever seen

57:26.372 --> 57:27.805
- in my life.
- Oh, come on.

57:27.807 --> 57:29.373
How's Philly?

57:29.375 --> 57:32.276
Philly's been incredible.

57:32.278 --> 57:35.079
I was
on this amazing panel today

57:35.081 --> 57:37.881
about creative destruction.

57:37.883 --> 57:42.953
And the writer Kazantzakis...
and he says basically

57:42.955 --> 57:46.256
this idea that destruction

57:46.258 --> 57:49.862
is a prerequisite
for creative activity.

57:51.297 --> 57:55.099
How fucking cool is that?

57:59.939 --> 58:02.906
Tell me more. What else
is happening over there?

58:02.908 --> 58:05.242
Um, I found out
that I'm a finalist

58:05.244 --> 58:07.044
for this fellowship in Rome,

58:07.046 --> 58:08.814
which, I don't know,
could be amazing.

59:03.302 --> 59:05.369
Hi. I'm sorry.
You gotta take him.

59:05.371 --> 59:07.771
- I can't take the dog.
- Really sorry. Please take him.

59:07.773 --> 59:09.806
- I can't take the dog.
- No, you will take him.

59:09.808 --> 59:11.375
- My building won't let me.
- Because I can't have him.

59:11.377 --> 59:13.310
- What are you doing?
- And he wants to be with you.

59:13.312 --> 59:15.312
- He really wants to be here.
- Are you fucking crazy?

59:15.314 --> 59:17.047
What are you doing?
Take the fucking dog.

59:17.049 --> 59:18.849
Sorry. I tried. I couldn't.
It was fucking...

59:18.851 --> 59:20.052
Where...

1:01:11.397 --> 1:01:12.831
Come with me.

1:02:45.457 --> 1:02:48.193
You're gonna forget me
in life, aren't you?

1:02:49.361 --> 1:02:50.628
You know what? You're...

1:02:50.630 --> 1:02:53.230
You're gonna
forget me next week.

1:02:53.232 --> 1:02:55.700
That's what's gonna happen.

1:02:55.702 --> 1:02:57.670
It's okay if you do.

1:03:01.407 --> 1:03:04.343
I could just stare at you
for fucking...

1:03:06.713 --> 1:03:09.682
I mean, you're gonna end up
seeing some stuff if you do.

1:05:03.428 --> 1:05:05.595
You gotta
turn it up a little more.

1:05:07.466 --> 1:05:08.799
- How you doing?
- Oh, my God!

1:05:08.801 --> 1:05:10.333
What's up?

1:05:10.335 --> 1:05:12.102
- Oh, my God.
- Wow, look at you.

1:05:12.104 --> 1:05:13.638
- It's so good to see you.
- You look... This is Daphne.

1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:15.338
- My friend, Sydney.
- Hi.

1:05:15.340 --> 1:05:17.107
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1:05:17.109 --> 1:05:18.876
- Jezebel. What's yours?
- Jezebel. Okay.

1:05:18.878 --> 1:05:20.678
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:22.379
- Hey!
- I-I'm Daphne.

1:05:22.381 --> 1:05:24.381
So I bring them
out here to this house.

1:05:24.383 --> 1:05:25.850
Ready for the night.

1:05:25.852 --> 1:05:28.251
I would say... I would say
anything's possible.

1:05:28.253 --> 1:05:29.720
The Romans
were... were wise.

1:05:29.722 --> 1:05:32.422
H-Hello, baby.

1:05:32.424 --> 1:05:33.758
- Cheers.
- Thank you for having us.

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:36.226
- Cheers!
- Cheers to Bart.

1:05:36.228 --> 1:05:37.662
- You're the man.
- Yeah.

1:05:37.664 --> 1:05:39.329
- It's nice to see you.
- Whose dog is this?

1:05:39.331 --> 1:05:40.665
That's my friend Jack's dog.

1:05:40.667 --> 1:05:42.232
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:05:42.234 --> 1:05:43.701
Do you know Jack?
Do you know who I mean?

1:05:43.703 --> 1:05:45.201
- Don't think so.
- The writer.

1:05:45.203 --> 1:05:46.871
Don't think so.

Hi.

Stop.

- Why? What's wrong?
- Stop. Just stop.

- What's wrong?
- What are you doing?

1:09:05.905 --> 1:09:07.705
I was... I was downstairs.

1:09:07.707 --> 1:09:09.474

1:09:21.821 --> 1:09:23.721
Oh, God.

1:09:23.723 --> 1:09:25.588
Don't fucking...

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:30.060
Oh, my God.

1:09:30.062 --> 1:09:32.129
Eh, you're being...
you're being stupid.

1:09:32.131 --> 1:09:34.366
You're being stupid.
Don't be stupid.

1:09:35.134 --> 1:09:36.368
Come on.

1:09:37.536 --> 1:09:38.936
It's all...
Don't be like that.

1:09:38.938 --> 1:09:40.405
Don't be like that.

1:09:44.777 --> 1:09:46.609
I said don't do that.

1:09:46.611 --> 1:09:47.980
I know what you're doing.

1:09:49.649 --> 1:09:52.285
I said...
I said my shit, you know?

1:12:24.937 --> 1:12:27.071
Fuck. Fuck.

1:12:27.073 --> 1:12:29.006
Shit.

1:12:29.008 --> 1:12:30.676
My God. Oh, my God.

1:12:46.624 --> 1:12:49.193
Abigail would,
like, feel any change.

1:12:49.195 --> 1:12:50.260
- Oh.
- Hi.

1:12:50.262 --> 1:12:51.862
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:12:51.864 --> 1:12:53.596
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

1:12:53.598 --> 1:12:55.699
Where were you?

1:12:55.701 --> 1:12:57.835
Doesn't matter.
How's the shower going?

1:12:57.837 --> 1:12:59.670
- Super fun, super cute.
- Yeah?

1:12:59.672 --> 1:13:01.005
- Great.
- It's for you.

1:13:01.007 --> 1:13:02.574
Oh, thanks.

1:13:04.210 --> 1:13:05.943
Can I help with anything?

1:13:05.945 --> 1:13:08.879
No, you should just
get some food or something.

1:13:08.881 --> 1:13:10.748
We've already eaten,
but there's really good...

1:13:10.750 --> 1:13:13.250
Jen made
a great kale salad, so...

1:13:13.252 --> 1:13:15.121
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:13:17.289 --> 1:13:19.790
So yeah. So at least
you had, like, a time, you know?

1:13:19.792 --> 1:13:21.091
- Yeah.
- A place where they...

1:13:24.864 --> 1:13:27.898
- Who's the Lindsay Lohan?
- Billie's sister.

1:13:27.900 --> 1:13:30.067
Oh, yeah. Wait.
She was in the guesthouse.

1:13:30.069 --> 1:13:32.336
She was supposed to be here,
like, two hours ago.

1:13:32.338 --> 1:13:34.972
- Really?
- She's always been such a mess.

1:13:34.974 --> 1:13:37.676
Can you imagine
having a sister like that?

1:13:53.392 --> 1:13:55.659
It's a very nice image,

1:13:55.661 --> 1:13:57.930
you reading my book.

1:13:59.832 --> 1:14:02.668
I fucking missed you
when I was away.

1:14:03.969 --> 1:14:05.204
I missed you, too.

1:14:06.672 --> 1:14:09.640
Feel like I want
to call us something.

1:14:09.642 --> 1:14:11.942
Don't be sca... You look scared.
I don't mean to scare you.

1:14:11.944 --> 1:14:15.112
What I mean, like in a, uh...

1:14:15.114 --> 1:14:17.981
a different way
to what other people say.

1:14:17.983 --> 1:14:19.683
It doesn't have to be
boyfriend, girlfriend,

1:14:19.685 --> 1:14:21.318
doesn't have to be
anything traditional.

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:22.655
It's just...

1:14:25.391 --> 1:14:26.792
Just feels right.

1:14:30.763 --> 1:14:32.796
I like that.

1:14:32.798 --> 1:14:33.833
Yeah?

1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:35.701
Mm.

1:14:38.104 --> 1:14:39.937
I just don't get it.
It's like one minute,

1:14:39.939 --> 1:14:41.271
I'm having a panic attack,

1:14:41.273 --> 1:14:43.107
and the next,
I'm high on the chaos.

1:14:43.109 --> 1:14:46.076
Maybe you wanna rethink
the whole sabbatical thing.

1:14:46.078 --> 1:14:48.445
Fuck, no. Nothing good happens
when I'm alone. Trust me.

1:14:48.447 --> 1:14:50.349
How would you know?
You've never done it.

1:14:52.118 --> 1:14:53.383
I-I know.

1:14:53.385 --> 1:14:56.220
It shouldn't be that hard.

1:14:56.222 --> 1:14:58.288
That's not making me
feel any better.

1:14:58.290 --> 1:15:00.259
I'm not trying
to make you feel better.

1:15:04.730 --> 1:15:07.097
I keep thinking
about this night.

1:15:07.099 --> 1:15:10.136
It happened a while ago
when Adrian was out of town...

1:15:11.937 --> 1:15:15.205
when we all went out dancing,
the staff from the Center.

1:15:15.207 --> 1:15:17.174
Remember we used to go to
the Rabbit Hole every Thursday?

1:15:17.176 --> 1:15:18.244
Mm-hmm.

1:15:21.313 --> 1:15:22.980
We were so fucked up.

1:15:22.982 --> 1:15:24.049
What happened?

1:15:26.752 --> 1:15:28.754
That's a very good question.

1:15:46.772 --> 1:15:48.438
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:50.407
I have an idea.

1:15:50.409 --> 1:15:51.443
Uh-oh.

1:15:52.411 --> 1:15:54.278
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:55.915
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:15:57.116 --> 1:15:58.884
Think we should
go dancing tonight.

1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:02.920
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:16:02.922 --> 1:16:05.489
- I think it could be really fun.
- Yeah.

1:16:05.491 --> 1:16:06.859
You ever seen me dance?

1:16:08.027 --> 1:16:09.927
No, I haven't.

1:16:09.929 --> 1:16:11.195
You're in for such a treat.

1:16:11.197 --> 1:16:13.032
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Yeah.

1:16:14.133 --> 1:16:15.766
It was a great idea.

1:16:15.768 --> 1:16:17.069
It's gonna be fun.

1:16:56.275 --> 1:16:57.474
Can I get us drinks?

1:16:57.476 --> 1:16:59.378
Uh-huh.

1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:22.966
Let's go! Let's go!

1:17:22.968 --> 1:17:24.970
- We're fine. We're fine.
- I got her.

1:17:26.472 --> 1:17:27.537
Maybe just take me home.

1:17:27.539 --> 1:17:29.206
Nah, my place is super close by.

1:17:29.208 --> 1:17:30.509
Jed, stop.

1:17:32.411 --> 1:17:33.543
Stop.

1:17:33.545 --> 1:17:35.514
Shh, shh, shh. It's all right.

1:17:40.352 --> 1:17:41.351
I can't.

1:17:41.353 --> 1:17:42.388
What?

1:18:25.030 --> 1:18:26.430
- Thank you.
- Hey.

1:18:26.432 --> 1:18:28.465
- Can we go?
- You wanna go?

1:18:28.467 --> 1:18:32.637
Yeah. Is that okay?
I know that's weird, but...

1:18:32.639 --> 1:18:33.904
- is that all right?
- Okay. Yeah.

1:18:33.906 --> 1:18:35.541
- I know...
- Okay.

1:18:45.317 --> 1:18:47.619
So are we gonna talk
about why we left so fast?

1:18:50.322 --> 1:18:52.356
Just starving.

1:18:52.358 --> 1:18:53.392
That's it?

1:18:59.264 --> 1:19:00.532
Yeah. Just hungry.

1:19:09.007 --> 1:19:11.141
Hi.

1:19:11.143 --> 1:19:13.443
Okay. Some very plain toast.

1:19:13.445 --> 1:19:15.045
Mmm.

1:19:15.047 --> 1:19:16.546
How you feeling?

1:19:16.548 --> 1:19:18.482
- Pretty shitty.
- Yeah?

1:19:18.484 --> 1:19:21.151
My class starts in 40 minutes.
I'm gonna have to go.

1:19:21.153 --> 1:19:23.086
Yeah, of course.

1:19:23.088 --> 1:19:24.990
I'll bring you some soup.

1:19:29.161 --> 1:19:30.295
Sleep.

1:19:31.698 --> 1:19:33.132
Woot, woot, woot.

1:19:39.471 --> 1:19:41.639
"I call her
when I get home.

1:19:41.641 --> 1:19:43.473
I don't know what to say to him,

1:19:43.475 --> 1:19:46.176
so I just hold the receiver
to my ear for a minute

1:19:46.178 --> 1:19:48.347
and listen to him
and say, 'Hello.'"

1:19:49.581 --> 1:19:50.949
Hello.

1:19:54.219 --> 1:19:56.355
Okay.

1:21:23.408 --> 1:21:25.843
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:21:25.845 --> 1:21:27.745
So we're gonna have
a little celebration,

1:21:27.747 --> 1:21:30.648
'cause I got
some pretty fucking good news.

1:21:30.650 --> 1:21:32.650
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:21:32.652 --> 1:21:35.452
I got the Bella Costa
Fellowship in Rome,

1:21:35.454 --> 1:21:38.421
five months, leaving in August.

1:21:38.423 --> 1:21:40.425
How cool is that?

1:21:44.463 --> 1:21:45.863
Cheers.

1:21:45.865 --> 1:21:47.665
Cheers.

1:21:47.667 --> 1:21:48.833
Wow.

1:21:48.835 --> 1:21:50.801
I know.

1:21:50.803 --> 1:21:54.772
It's... feels like a long time,
but I think you could come out,

1:21:54.774 --> 1:21:57.777
like, every...
every month conceivably.

1:21:59.111 --> 1:22:01.177
That is so amazing.

1:22:01.179 --> 1:22:03.148
You've worked so hard for that.

1:22:05.484 --> 1:22:07.417
What's going on?
Wh-What's wrong?

1:22:07.419 --> 1:22:10.487
Nothing. I'm just...
I'm just processing it.

1:22:10.489 --> 1:22:11.623
It's really...

1:22:14.593 --> 1:22:16.326
I'm really proud of you.

1:22:16.328 --> 1:22:17.462
Thanks.

1:22:18.497 --> 1:22:19.598
Tell me more.

1:22:21.300 --> 1:22:23.402
- If we're in Rome...
- Mm-hmm.

1:22:24.771 --> 1:22:27.504
we can go to the opera.

1:22:27.506 --> 1:22:31.608
We can eat pasta in bascaiola.

1:22:31.610 --> 1:22:32.677
Mm-hmm.

1:22:32.679 --> 1:22:34.845
Get out of the city one day

1:22:34.847 --> 1:22:38.415
and take bicycles
and cycle in the vineyards

1:22:38.417 --> 1:22:40.851
and drink wine.

1:22:40.853 --> 1:22:42.485
Get back on the bikes...

1:23:11.516 --> 1:23:14.184
So we got the results

1:23:14.186 --> 1:23:15.619
back from the ultrasound,

1:23:15.621 --> 1:23:18.388
and the baby is measuring
about half an inch,

1:23:18.390 --> 1:23:21.491
so that means you are spot on.
You're about six weeks.

1:23:21.493 --> 1:23:24.227
You are still early
in the pregnancy,

1:23:24.229 --> 1:23:25.796
so terminating the pregnancy...

1:24:11.610 --> 1:24:12.679
Whew.

1:24:14.346 --> 1:24:16.314
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:24:20.252 --> 1:24:23.486
Well,
I had quite the day...

1:24:25.925 --> 1:24:26.991
yet again.

1:24:26.993 --> 1:24:28.761
Jack, I'm pregnant.

1:24:34.901 --> 1:24:37.467
Hey. Hey.

1:24:37.469 --> 1:24:39.970
That's great.

1:24:39.972 --> 1:24:41.506
That's great.

1:24:42.675 --> 1:24:44.374
Hey, that's fucking great.

1:24:45.410 --> 1:24:48.679
Huh? That's so exciting.

1:24:48.681 --> 1:24:50.648
Oh, my God.

1:24:50.650 --> 1:24:51.984
It's okay.

1:24:54.453 --> 1:24:56.286
Hmm?

1:24:56.288 --> 1:24:58.958
I need to tell you something.

1:25:00.927 --> 1:25:02.561
What is it? Come on.

1:25:04.529 --> 1:25:05.698
Um...

1:25:07.934 --> 1:25:09.599
Uh...

1:25:09.601 --> 1:25:10.670
I...

1:25:15.875 --> 1:25:17.677
Daphne, come on. What is it?

1:25:18.711 --> 1:25:20.010
When you were out of town,

1:25:20.012 --> 1:25:21.413
I went to Big Sur...

1:25:22.447 --> 1:25:23.716
with Frank.

1:25:36.763 --> 1:25:39.429
So this is Frank's kid?

1:25:39.431 --> 1:25:40.831
No. I don't know.
I don't know.

1:25:40.833 --> 1:25:42.935
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

1:25:44.503 --> 1:25:46.471
That's great.

1:25:49.508 --> 1:25:51.409
I should have told you.

1:25:53.012 --> 1:25:57.480
What? You're so fucking sloppy.
For fuck's sake, Daphne,

1:25:57.482 --> 1:25:59.683
you can't make
such a mess of everything

1:25:59.685 --> 1:26:02.052
and use it as an excuse
for everything in your life.

1:26:02.054 --> 1:26:04.456
This is a fucking baby!

1:26:09.662 --> 1:26:11.463
Ah, fuck.

1:26:22.675 --> 1:26:24.342
I think you should go.

1:26:34.619 --> 1:26:35.755
You should go.

1:26:50.169 --> 1:26:52.805
I'm just so fucking stupid.

1:26:54.106 --> 1:26:55.773
Like really?

1:26:55.775 --> 1:26:57.977
Okay, well,
it's not your finest hour.

1:27:00.079 --> 1:27:02.347
I have this baby.
This baby will...

1:27:04.083 --> 1:27:06.652
God, I would be
such a shitty mom.

1:27:09.487 --> 1:27:10.890
You know what I think?

1:27:12.124 --> 1:27:14.058
I think you're
gonna have a great life

1:27:14.060 --> 1:27:15.527
if you have this baby.

1:27:18.097 --> 1:27:19.630
And I think
you have a great life

1:27:19.632 --> 1:27:21.499
if you don't have this baby.

1:27:22.935 --> 1:27:25.503
I think you have
more power than you know.

1:27:27.206 --> 1:27:30.440
I just don't know how to say no.
I don't know how to stop.

1:27:30.442 --> 1:27:34.747
I don't know how to just
fucking be okay with whatever...

1:27:35.982 --> 1:27:37.582
I have.

1:27:39.584 --> 1:27:41.752
I just don't think
you understand.

1:27:41.754 --> 1:27:43.821
- What?
- I don't think you understand

1:27:43.823 --> 1:27:46.058
who's next in line
to be loved by you.

1:27:52.131 --> 1:27:53.465
The baby.

1:27:58.871 --> 1:27:59.972
It's you.

1:28:49.956 --> 1:28:51.722
I think for most of my life,

1:28:51.724 --> 1:28:55.859
I've used my childhood
as an excuse for my behavior

1:28:55.861 --> 1:28:57.661
and my Mom.

1:28:57.663 --> 1:28:58.929
But, um...

1:29:00.532 --> 1:29:03.069
just tired.
I'm tired of hurting people.

1:29:04.770 --> 1:29:07.840
It's just the same thing,
and I'm just so tired.

1:29:10.843 --> 1:29:14.244
And the idea of having
to unlock all that shit

1:29:14.246 --> 1:29:16.015
is fucking terrifying...

1:29:16.983 --> 1:29:19.517
but I am going to.

1:29:24.824 --> 1:29:26.223
And, again, I don't...

1:29:26.225 --> 1:29:28.025
You know, I don't need
anything from you,

1:29:28.027 --> 1:29:31.328
and I don't... definitely
don't expect anything from you.

1:29:31.330 --> 1:29:32.898
Okay.

1:29:38.938 --> 1:29:40.806
I don't know
how that makes me feel.

1:29:42.574 --> 1:29:44.875
Like, I know when I
have this baby, if I've...

1:29:44.877 --> 1:29:48.948
That's weird. Even if...
if I have this baby, that, uh...

1:29:50.216 --> 1:29:51.949
I... you know,

1:29:51.951 --> 1:29:55.185
I'm not gonna know
how to do things,

1:29:55.187 --> 1:29:58.824
and it's not gonna
magically change my life.

1:29:59.959 --> 1:30:01.925
But I do think
that it's given me

1:30:01.927 --> 1:30:06.098
a reason to look
at things differently and to...

1:30:12.304 --> 1:30:14.673
just fucking be
a better person.

1:30:17.343 --> 1:30:19.745
I think it's great
that you're saying all this.

1:30:21.914 --> 1:30:23.049
And...

1:30:24.950 --> 1:30:28.087
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't want to hear you say it.

1:30:31.157 --> 1:30:34.860
But I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

- Hey.
- Hi.

1:32:00.946 --> 1:32:03.013
Why aren't you dancing?

1:32:03.015 --> 1:32:04.248
I'm... I'm good.

1:32:04.250 --> 1:32:06.416
I'm just watching.

1:32:06.418 --> 1:32:08.152
Just wanted you to come up
and be with us.

1:32:08.154 --> 1:32:09.786
Mom, please, please. I just...

1:32:09.788 --> 1:32:11.355
Please let me sit.
You're hurting my hand.

1:32:11.357 --> 1:32:13.190
Come on. Come on. I don't
want you to embarrass me.

1:32:13.192 --> 1:32:14.825
Mom, please, please.
Just let me...

1:32:14.827 --> 1:32:16.393
I want you out there
with your sister and...

1:32:16.395 --> 1:32:18.328
Can I not... not dance
and still have a good time?

1:32:18.330 --> 1:32:20.197
What's going on with you? Huh?

1:32:20.199 --> 1:32:22.266
Nothing. I'm fine.

1:32:22.268 --> 1:32:23.433
Just...

1:32:23.435 --> 1:32:24.670
I'm good.

1:32:39.752 --> 1:32:41.785
What's going on with you?

1:32:41.787 --> 1:32:43.854
Nothing. I'm fine.

1:32:43.856 --> 1:32:45.255
I didn't feel like dancing.

1:32:45.257 --> 1:32:46.823
That's it.

1:32:46.825 --> 1:32:49.092
No, everything
clearly is not fine.

1:32:49.094 --> 1:32:51.094
You just stormed out of there...

1:32:51.096 --> 1:32:52.963
- Mom, I didn't wanna dance.
- like I did something wrong.

1:32:52.965 --> 1:32:54.965
I don't know what else
you want from me. I'm here.

1:32:54.967 --> 1:32:57.136
I'm sorry that I
can't give you what you need.

1:33:05.377 --> 1:33:07.945
I am so proud of you, Daphne.

1:33:07.947 --> 1:33:10.316
- Mom.
- I am in awe of you.

1:33:11.984 --> 1:33:14.086
- Do you hear me?
- I'm happy for you, Mom.

1:33:15.254 --> 1:33:17.921
I don't think
that you understand

1:33:17.923 --> 1:33:23.327
why I went from guy to guy,
as you say. It...

1:33:23.329 --> 1:33:25.462
I... My whole life,
I've been trying to create

1:33:25.464 --> 1:33:27.798
something that was stable
and sound and...

1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:32.069
and I, granted,
made some bad choices.

1:33:32.071 --> 1:33:33.105
It's okay.

1:33:34.573 --> 1:33:36.540
But it was for...

1:33:36.542 --> 1:33:38.308
It was for my daughters.

1:33:38.310 --> 1:33:40.177
That was the whole reasoning
behind it.

1:33:40.179 --> 1:33:42.948
Do... do you believe me?

1:34:08.474 --> 1:34:10.407
Center for Progress in the Arts.

1:34:10.409 --> 1:34:13.078
Hi. Um, Helen Crawford, please.

1:34:18.284 --> 1:34:19.516
Hello.

1:34:19.518 --> 1:34:22.119
Hi, Helen.
Uh, it's Daphne Mirador.

1:34:22.121 --> 1:34:24.288
I used to work
at Center for Progress.

1:34:24.290 --> 1:34:26.323
Of course. Daphne.

1:34:26.325 --> 1:34:28.827
Uh, I was sorry
to hear about you leaving.

1:34:30.195 --> 1:34:31.461
Yeah, me, too.

1:34:31.463 --> 1:34:35.132
Um, it's actually
why I'm calling.

1:34:35.134 --> 1:34:38.535
Uh, I...

1:34:40.239 --> 1:34:42.640
I know
that you had H.R. over there,

1:34:42.642 --> 1:34:46.345
um, a-and...

1:34:48.414 --> 1:34:51.214
this is not
an easy conversation to have.

1:34:51.216 --> 1:34:54.918
Uh, I just want you to know
that I loved my job

1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:59.189
and I didn't want to leave,
but something happened that...

1:34:59.191 --> 1:35:03.962
made me feel like I had to,
and I would like to explain why.

1:35:05.964 --> 1:35:07.533
You can tell me anything.

1:35:10.402 --> 1:35:11.437
Thank you.

1:36:27.479 --> 1:36:29.548
Hey.

1:36:33.218 --> 1:36:35.120
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:36:42.161 --> 1:36:44.263
How you doing?

1:36:49.268 --> 1:36:51.603
How... I mean,
how far along are you?

1:36:53.172 --> 1:36:54.506
5 1/2 months.

1:36:57.476 --> 1:37:00.043
I tried calling you
a few times.

1:37:00.045 --> 1:37:01.679
No, I-I know. I'm sorry.

1:37:01.681 --> 1:37:04.281
I-I wanted... You know,
I wanted to reach out,

1:37:04.283 --> 1:37:05.282
uh, but, um...

1:37:05.284 --> 1:37:06.585
It's fine.

1:37:07.754 --> 1:37:09.286
So you're good?
Y-You're good.

1:37:09.288 --> 1:37:10.688
You're...

1:37:10.690 --> 1:37:12.456
- Things are good.
- I'm okay.

1:37:12.458 --> 1:37:13.492
Yeah.

1:37:15.227 --> 1:37:16.593
Okay is good.

1:37:17.730 --> 1:37:20.631
Uh, I assume Jack called you.

1:37:20.633 --> 1:37:23.033
No. No, we're not, um...

1:37:23.035 --> 1:37:25.235
we're not talking,
actually, anymore.

1:37:25.237 --> 1:37:26.369
Uh...

1:37:26.371 --> 1:37:27.738
Was...

1:37:27.740 --> 1:37:31.043
It's just other stuff.

1:37:32.745 --> 1:37:34.377
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:37:34.379 --> 1:37:37.113
Um, this is Daphne...

1:37:37.115 --> 1:37:38.683
- Hi.
- and this is Lila.

1:37:38.685 --> 1:37:40.718
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:43.455
All right.
It was really nice to see you.

1:38:21.527 --> 1:38:22.695
Is it mine?

1:38:26.265 --> 1:38:27.366
I don't know.

1:38:31.638 --> 1:38:32.870
I mean, I...

1:38:32.872 --> 1:38:35.173
"I don't know" is like...

1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:42.649
What am I supposed
to do with that?

1:38:46.218 --> 1:38:47.452
She's mine.

1:38:57.129 --> 1:38:58.194
"She"?

1:38:58.196 --> 1:38:59.565
She.

1:39:03.168 --> 1:39:04.301
Oh, God.

1:39:08.875 --> 1:39:11.308
That's great.

1:39:11.310 --> 1:39:13.145
That's really...

1:39:17.249 --> 1:39:20.419
Yeah, that's...
You know, that scares me.

1:39:22.689 --> 1:39:25.288
Girls... girls scare me.

1:39:29.494 --> 1:39:33.597
Just another... Just another you
to burn down the planet.

1:39:36.268 --> 1:39:37.436
It's amazing.

1:39:39.237 --> 1:39:42.539
I don't know
what I'm gonna do with her,

1:39:42.541 --> 1:39:44.376
but I'm gonna figure it out.

1:39:47.179 --> 1:39:49.613
I mean, it's gonna be great.
You know, you gotta...

1:39:49.615 --> 1:39:52.215
you gotta teach her the basics,
you know...

1:39:52.217 --> 1:39:55.822
depression, anxiety...

1:39:57.556 --> 1:40:00.791
you know,
being hung-over, and...

1:40:00.793 --> 1:40:01.828
yeah.

1:40:03.195 --> 1:40:04.631
Gotta teach her to paint.

1:40:06.231 --> 1:40:07.965
You gotta read her stories,
you know,

1:40:07.967 --> 1:40:10.367
but the right kind of stories.
You gotta tell her the truth.

1:40:10.369 --> 1:40:12.335
You gotta tell her...

1:40:12.337 --> 1:40:13.372
You know, you gotta...

1:40:18.410 --> 1:40:21.513
I want to be a Dad, you know?

1:40:23.950 --> 1:40:25.384
I do.

1:40:29.421 --> 1:40:30.823
Do you want to feel her?

1:40:36.228 --> 1:40:37.529
That's crazy.

1:40:46.304 --> 1:40:48.706
It's like magic.

1:40:48.708 --> 1:40:51.476
You loved me then,
but I'm feeling it now.

1:40:52.444 --> 1:40:53.744
It's so weird.

1:40:53.746 --> 1:40:55.612
Feels like a star's light,

1:40:55.614 --> 1:40:58.849
how it takes a long time
to get where it's going.

1:40:58.851 --> 1:41:02.452
But it's here. I feel it.

1:41:02.454 --> 1:41:05.488
You loved me when I
wasn't going to love myself.

1:41:05.490 --> 1:41:07.424
You're amazing.

1:41:07.426 --> 1:41:09.594
And I want you to be happy.

1:41:12.932 --> 1:41:14.566
Love, Daph.

1:41:22.607 --> 1:41:23.641
Hi.

1:41:23.643 --> 1:41:25.408
Oh, what's going on, dude?

1:41:25.410 --> 1:41:26.944
- How are you?
- Good, man.

1:41:26.946 --> 1:41:28.746
Um, is Adrian around?

1:41:28.748 --> 1:41:31.882
Oh, no. He's, uh, touring
India and Africa with Lanie,

1:41:31.884 --> 1:41:34.719
said he wouldn't back for,
like, six months or something.

1:41:34.721 --> 1:41:35.788
So...

1:41:36.789 --> 1:41:37.957
Wow.

1:41:40.727 --> 1:41:43.060
That's cool.
He'd always wanted to do that.

1:41:43.062 --> 1:41:44.695
Yeah, man. Good for him.

1:41:44.697 --> 1:41:47.698
Well, can I
leave this here for him?

1:41:47.700 --> 1:41:49.869
- Yeah, I can give it to him.
- All right.

1:41:51.637 --> 1:41:53.804
- Thank you.
- All right.

1:41:53.806 --> 1:41:56.374
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, good to see you, too.

1:42:00.579 --> 1:42:01.979
I was so little.

1:42:01.981 --> 1:42:05.049
You were so tiny, and now
you have feet like mine.

1:42:05.051 --> 1:42:07.450
Where did you buy these things?
These are incredible.

1:42:07.452 --> 1:42:10.087
Sweetie, I didn't buy them.
I-I made these. Look.

1:42:10.089 --> 1:42:13.389
- You made these? You sewed them?
- This is so not great.

1:42:13.391 --> 1:42:15.025
No, are you kidding?
This is incredible.

1:42:15.027 --> 1:42:17.460
I can't wait
to put my little one in it.

1:42:17.462 --> 1:42:19.596
Well, honey,
you don't have to do that.

1:42:19.598 --> 1:42:21.598
- You're gonna...
- No, I want to.

1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:22.902
It's so special.

1:42:25.872 --> 1:42:27.272
I would love that.

1:42:29.709 --> 1:42:31.309
It would mean the world to me.

1:42:34.947 --> 1:42:36.649
You know, Daph, um...

1:42:39.518 --> 1:42:41.384
if there's anything
that I can do for you,

1:42:41.386 --> 1:42:44.354
anything at all,
um, you know, if...

1:42:44.356 --> 1:42:47.725
if you would like to stay
with Carl and me for a while,

1:42:47.727 --> 1:42:50.493
you know, just...
just so you don't have to...

1:42:50.495 --> 1:42:52.930
do this all on your own.
And I could baby-sit.

1:42:52.932 --> 1:42:54.732
- I would love that.
- I mean, if you don't

1:42:54.734 --> 1:42:56.601
- want me to, I completely...
- I would love that.

1:43:02.775 --> 1:43:04.010
Thank you.

1:43:08.446 --> 1:43:10.315
Oh, wait. Look.

1:43:43.115 --> 1:43:45.850
I mean,
physically I'm just so ready,

1:43:45.852 --> 1:43:47.019
so ready.

1:43:47.987 --> 1:43:49.989
And mentally, I'm just...

1:43:53.059 --> 1:43:55.661
not ready.

1:44:05.671 --> 1:44:07.840
Imagine that you're
in a field of flowers.

1:44:11.811 --> 1:44:15.715
You can feel the warmth
on your skin from the sun.

1:44:18.718 --> 1:44:21.586
You look forward,
and you notice there's a door.

1:44:24.690 --> 1:44:27.825
So you walk over to that door,

1:44:27.827 --> 1:44:29.629
but the handle's locked.

1:44:31.463 --> 1:44:33.398
You have the keys.

1:44:35.067 --> 1:44:36.869
You've always had them.

1:44:37.837 --> 1:44:39.837
So you open the door.

1:44:39.839 --> 1:44:43.976
A huge beam of bright light
shines on you.

1:44:49.782 --> 1:44:52.084
Everything might not be okay...

1:44:55.087 --> 1:44:57.056
but that's okay.

1:44:59.524 --> 1:45:01.559
You're exactly
where you need to be.

1:45:09.501 --> 1:45:11.203
You are loved.
