00:34.117 --> 00:35.743
Will you take a look at that?

00:35.827 --> 00:37.202
Pretty pathetic, huh?

00:37.620 --> 00:38.787
Well, you'll never believe this,

00:38.872 --> 00:42.041
but that llama you're looking at
was once a human being.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.709
And not just any human being.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.210
That guy was an emperor.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.337
A rich, powerful ball of charisma.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.714
Oh, yeah!

00:50.133 --> 00:51.633
This is his story.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.552
Well, actually my story.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.889
That's right. I'm that llama.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.391
The name is Kuzco...

00:59.434 --> 01:01.852
Emperor Kuzco.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.731
I was the world's nicest guy,
and they ruined my life for no reason.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.066
Is that hard to believe?

01:07.108 --> 01:09.318
Look, I tell you what.
You go back aways...

01:09.402 --> 01:12.404
You know, before I was a llama,
and this will all make sense.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.407
All right, now see,
that's a little too far back.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.576
Look at me!

01:17.619 --> 01:19.078
That's me as a baby.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.374
All right, let's move ahead.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.602
Yeah.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.604
There are despots and dictators

01:45.688 --> 01:48.148
Political manipulators

01:48.233 --> 01:52.486
There are blue bloods
with the intellects of fleas

01:52.570 --> 01:54.613
There are kings and catty tyrants

01:54.656 --> 01:57.825
Who are so lacking in refinements

01:57.909 --> 02:00.744
They'd be better suited
swinging from the trees

02:01.162 --> 02:03.455
He was born and raised to rule

02:03.498 --> 02:06.125
No one has ever been as cool

02:06.167 --> 02:09.419
In a thousand years of aristocracy

02:10.630 --> 02:12.965
An enigma and a mystery

02:13.049 --> 02:15.008
In Mesoamerican history

02:15.093 --> 02:18.637
The quintessence
of perfection that is he

02:20.098 --> 02:22.432
Okay, this is the real me. Not this.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.892
This. Not this.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.477
Winner! Loser.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.314
Okay, see this palace?
Everyone in it is at my command.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.774
Check this out.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.526
Butler.

02:32.610 --> 02:33.986
Chef.

02:34.779 --> 02:35.988
Theme song guy.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.656
Yeah!

02:37.740 --> 02:39.658
He's the sovereign lord of the nation

02:39.742 --> 02:42.286
He's the hippest cat in creation

02:42.328 --> 02:45.330
He's the alpha, the omega, A to Z

02:46.457 --> 02:48.876
And this perfect world will spin

02:48.960 --> 02:51.128
Around his every little whim

02:51.171 --> 02:54.006
'Cause this perfect world
begins and ends with

02:54.048 --> 02:55.048
Me.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.175
What's his name?

02:56.217 --> 02:59.636
Kuzco

02:59.679 --> 03:01.013
That's his name

03:01.055 --> 03:02.806
Kuzco

03:02.849 --> 03:04.933
He's the king of the world

03:05.018 --> 03:07.019
Kuzco

03:07.103 --> 03:08.854
Is he hip or what?

03:08.897 --> 03:10.814
Kuzco

03:10.857 --> 03:12.524
Yeah

03:16.529 --> 03:18.322
You threw off my groove!

03:18.364 --> 03:21.617
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off
the emperor's groove.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.536
Sorry!

03:25.538 --> 03:26.538
You were saying?

03:26.623 --> 03:29.124
What's his name?
Kuzco

03:29.209 --> 03:32.628
Kuzco

03:36.633 --> 03:38.842
That's his name

03:40.386 --> 03:42.721
Is he hip or what?

03:43.681 --> 03:47.267
Don't you know
he's the king of the world?

03:49.938 --> 03:51.605
Yeah

03:56.361 --> 03:57.444
Boom, baby!

03:58.238 --> 04:00.739
Your Highness,
it is time for you to choose your bride.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.241
All righty.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.825
Trot out the ladies.

04:04.577 --> 04:05.994
Let's take a look-see.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.497
Hate your hair. Not likely.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.253
And let me guess.
You have a great personality.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.088
Is this really the best you could do?

04:16.130 --> 04:18.923
Yes. Oh, no. I mean, perhaps...

04:18.966 --> 04:20.926
What is he babbling about?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.262
He's like the thing
that wouldn't shut up.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.057
Anyway, still wondering
about that llama in the opening?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.644
Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.773
First, there's Pacha.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.734
Excuse me.
I'm here to see Emperor Kuzco.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.319
You see, I got this summons...

04:39.404 --> 04:43.156
lnside, up the stairs, and to the left.
Just follow the signs.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.034
Great. Thanks a lot.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.372
And don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.792
Pardon me. That's mine.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.918
Here you go.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.461
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.048
Hey. Are you all right? Here. Let me...

05:00.133 --> 05:02.009
-You're so very kind.
-What happened?

05:02.093 --> 05:05.220
Well, I threw off the emperor's groove.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.430
-What?
-His groove!

05:06.472 --> 05:09.182
The rhythm in which he lives his life,
his pattern of behavior.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.309
I threw it off,

05:10.393 --> 05:12.811
and the emperor had me
thrown out the window.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.814
Really? I'm supposed to see him today.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.691
Don't throw off his groove!

05:17.775 --> 05:18.775
Okay.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.319
Beware the groove.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.820
Hey, are you gonna be all right?

05:21.904 --> 05:23.488
Groove.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.574
You see what I mean?

05:25.658 --> 05:28.327
This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is,

05:28.411 --> 05:29.786
he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.998
And why have you come here today?

05:33.041 --> 05:36.543
Well... Your Highness...
l mean, Your Grace.

05:36.627 --> 05:39.338
Okay, gang.
Check out this piece of work.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.674
This is Yzma, the emperor's advisor,

05:42.717 --> 05:45.344
living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.763
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.848
Every decade or so
she gets a new one.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.808
This year's model is called Kronk.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.854
Yeah, I got that there, Yzma.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.525
Yep, that's Kronk.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.445
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit

06:03.529 --> 06:06.073
of trying to run the country
behind my back,

06:06.157 --> 06:08.158
and I'm thinkin' that's got to stop.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.495
It is no concern of mine
whether your family has...

06:11.537 --> 06:12.704
What was it again?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.414
Food.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.210
You really should have thought of that
before you became peasants.

06:18.294 --> 06:21.713
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!

06:21.756 --> 06:24.216
But I... Okay.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.347
The nerve of some of those peasants?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.932
Tell me about it.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.475
Hi there.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.435
Your Highness.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.232
You were doing it again.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.235
Doing? Doing... Doing what?

06:43.277 --> 06:44.569
Doing my job.

06:44.612 --> 06:47.489
I'm the emperor,
and you're the emperor's advisor.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.324
-Remember that?
-But, Your Highness,

06:49.409 --> 06:52.035
l was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.122
Look at these wrinkles.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.417
What is holding this woman together?

06:59.335 --> 07:02.754
What the...
How long has that been there?

07:02.797 --> 07:05.090
Good thinkin', Yzma.
What do you say, Kuzco?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.716
No touchy!

07:06.759 --> 07:08.593
No touchy. No touch.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.304
Excuse me, Your Highness.
The village leader is here to see you.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.931
Great. Send him in.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.641
And by the way, you're fired.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.143
Fired?

07:16.227 --> 07:18.395
What do you mean, fired?

07:18.771 --> 07:19.896
How else can I say it?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.566
You're being let go,
your department's being downsized,

07:22.608 --> 07:25.152
you're part of an outplacement,
we're going in a different direction,

07:25.278 --> 07:28.196
we're not picking up your option...
Take your pick. I got more.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.657
But I... You...

07:32.452 --> 07:33.952
But... But, Your Highness,

07:34.036 --> 07:36.663
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

07:36.747 --> 07:39.875
for many, many years.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.752
Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.046
You just hit yours 50 years ago.

07:45.756 --> 07:48.800
So, who's in my chair?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.469
I know! Yzma.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.970
Yzma's in your chair, right?

07:52.054 --> 07:54.764
Very good, Kronk. Here. Get the snack.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.016
Got it!

07:57.727 --> 07:59.978
Okay, you heard the man. Up, up, up.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.189
I'm okay. I'm fine.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.445
Okay. Show him in.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.533
Afternoon, Your Highness.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.327
I'm here
because I received a summons...

08:15.411 --> 08:18.455
Hey, there he is! My main village man.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.123
Pacha.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.583
Anyway, I got this summons...

08:21.667 --> 08:23.376
Pacha.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.338
That's right.
You are just the man I wanted to see.

08:26.422 --> 08:27.506
I am?

08:27.548 --> 08:30.091
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.513
You can fix my problem, can't you?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.515
Sure. I'll do what I can.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.100
Good, good.
That's just what I wanted to hear.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.520
Are you aware of just how important
your village is to the empire?

08:42.605 --> 08:45.857
Well, I know we grow the crops
that you use here at the palace.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.776
We also herd the llamas that you...

08:51.113 --> 08:52.280
My village?

08:52.365 --> 08:53.490
Yeah.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.827
You got a pretty sweet little setup there
on top of that hill, don't you?

08:58.371 --> 09:02.374
Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop
for the last six generations.

09:04.418 --> 09:08.129
So tell me, where do you find
you get the most sun?

09:08.214 --> 09:12.509
I'd say just on the other side
of those trees.

09:12.552 --> 09:17.222
When the sun hits that ridge just right,
these hills sing.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.765
Well, that settles it.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.725
-Really?
-Yep. Problem solved.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.060
Thanks for coming.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.646
That's it? That's all you wanted me for?

09:24.730 --> 09:28.483
I just needed an insider's opinion
before I okay'd this spot for my pool.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.528
Your pool?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.197
Welcome to Kuzcotopia,

09:34.240 --> 09:37.909
my ultimate summer getaway
complete with water slide.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.120
-What?
-Isn't it great?

09:40.204 --> 09:42.497
It's my birthday gift to me.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.249
I'm so happy.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.504
I don't understand
how this could happen.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.131
Well, let me clear it up for you.

09:51.215 --> 09:54.426
At my birthday celebration tomorrow,
l give the word,

09:54.510 --> 09:56.386
and your town will be destroyed

09:56.429 --> 09:58.763
to make way for this...

10:04.103 --> 10:06.271
So, if I were you, I'd pick up some
change-of-address forms

10:06.314 --> 10:07.314
on the way home.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.774
But, where will we live?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.362
Don't know, don't care. How's that?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.114
But wait. You can't...

10:19.785 --> 10:21.745
When I give the word,

10:21.787 --> 10:24.956
your little town thingy will be bye-bye.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.791
Bye-bye!

10:27.293 --> 10:28.793
Wait. No...

10:30.129 --> 10:32.797
Yeah. Everything was goin' my way.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.967
Or so I thought.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.093
He can't get rid of me that easily.

10:38.429 --> 10:42.223
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is?

10:42.308 --> 10:44.934
Does he... A little to the left.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.813
Have any idea of who he's dealing with?

10:48.856 --> 10:51.983
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.236
Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.863
Yeah, go figure.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.865
Well, it's better
you're takin' out your anger

10:58.949 --> 11:00.950
on these things instead
of the real Kuzco?

11:02.161 --> 11:04.245
That's it, Kronk! That's it!

11:04.330 --> 11:06.456
I'll get rid of Kuzco.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.167
The real Kuzco?

11:09.210 --> 11:11.670
Of course the real Kuzco.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.505
Don't you see? It's perfect.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.049
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne,

11:16.133 --> 11:19.678
I'll take over and rule the empire.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.179
Brilliant!

11:21.263 --> 11:23.890
So how does that work
with you bein' fired and all?

11:23.974 --> 11:26.685
The only ones who know
about that are the three of us,

11:26.769 --> 11:28.353
soon to be the two of us.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.979
And I'm one of those two, right?

11:30.022 --> 11:31.022
To the secret lab!

11:33.943 --> 11:36.236
Pull the lever, Kronk.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.696
Wrong lever!

11:39.532 --> 11:42.283
Why do we even have that lever?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.453
Get out of my way!

11:47.540 --> 11:48.623
Please remain seated

11:48.708 --> 11:50.834
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.795
Faster, faster!

11:54.130 --> 11:56.381
Yzma, put your hands in the air!

12:04.390 --> 12:05.849
How shall I do it?

12:06.642 --> 12:07.851
I know.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.728
I'll turn him into a flea,

12:09.812 --> 12:11.438
a harmless little flea,

12:11.522 --> 12:13.398
and then I'll put that flea in a box,

12:13.441 --> 12:15.316
and then I'll put that box
inside of another box,

12:15.401 --> 12:17.277
and then I'll mail that box to myself,

12:17.361 --> 12:19.571
and when it arrives...

12:19.613 --> 12:21.406
I'll smash it with a hammer!

12:22.408 --> 12:24.868
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!

12:24.910 --> 12:25.952
Genius, I say!

12:31.125 --> 12:32.792
Or, to save on postage,

12:32.877 --> 12:34.794
I'll just poison him with this.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.255
Take it, Kronk.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.174
Feel the power.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.176
I can feel it.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.386
Our moment of triumph approaches.

12:45.055 --> 12:47.098
It's dinner time.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.527
So, is everything ready for tonight?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.113
Yeah. I thought we'd start off
with soup and a light salad

13:02.156 --> 13:03.615
and then see how we feel after that.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.909
Not the dinner...

13:05.951 --> 13:07.243
The you-know...

13:07.745 --> 13:09.496
Right. The poison...

13:09.580 --> 13:10.789
The poison for Kuzco,

13:10.873 --> 13:13.208
the poison chosen
specially to kill Kuzco,

13:13.292 --> 13:14.542
Kuzco's poison.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.712
-That poison?
-Yes! That poison.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.922
Got you covered.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.131
Excellent.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.468
A few drops in his drink,
then I'll propose a toast,

13:23.511 --> 13:25.637
and he will be dead before dessert.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.431
Which is a real shame,
because it's gonna be delicious.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.308
Boom, bam, baby!

13:30.351 --> 13:31.726
Let's get to the grub.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.687
I am one hungry king of the world.

13:35.397 --> 13:38.650
So, no hard feelings about being let go?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.361
None whatsoever.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.532
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.

13:46.116 --> 13:48.535
Drink. Right.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.010
Your Highness.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.638
Is something burning?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.390
My spinach puffs!

14:17.773 --> 14:20.817
So, he seems nice.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.069
He is.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.532
He's what, in his late 20s?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.118
I'm not sure.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.536
Saved 'em!

14:31.620 --> 14:32.704
-That's great.
-Great!

14:32.746 --> 14:33.955
-Good job.
-Very good job.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.790
Watch it. They're still hot.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.339
Kronk. The emperor needs his drink.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.260
Right. Right.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.061
Hey, Kronky,
everything okay back there?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.354
Well...

15:01.233 --> 15:03.860
The drinks were a bit on the...

15:06.071 --> 15:07.322
Warm side.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.701
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.411
Yes, Kronk.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.746
Riveting.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.081
A toast to the emperor!

15:17.750 --> 15:19.876
Long live Kuzco!

15:20.878 --> 15:22.253
Don't drink the wine.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.755
Poison.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.763
Tasty.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.974
Finally!

15:35.351 --> 15:36.559
Good work, Kronk.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.770
They're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.064
Now to get rid of the body.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.275
Okay! What were we saying?

15:45.527 --> 15:47.612
We were just making a toast

15:47.696 --> 15:48.947
to your long and...

15:50.908 --> 15:52.867
Healthy rule.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.536
Right. So what are you gonna do?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.997
I mean, you've been
around here a long time,

15:58.082 --> 15:59.999
and I really mean a long time.

16:01.418 --> 16:05.129
It might be difficult
for someone of your age

16:05.172 --> 16:07.090
adjusting to life in the private sector.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.969
Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal?
Be a friend?

16:12.137 --> 16:13.388
Now, about you finding new work...

16:13.472 --> 16:14.973
Hit him on the head.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.599
That's gonna be tough.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.850
More broccoli?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.602
Because you're... You know.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.980
Let's face it. You're no spring chicken,

16:22.064 --> 16:24.273
and I mean that
in the best possible way.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.819
What? A llama?

16:27.903 --> 16:29.862
He's supposed to be dead!

16:29.947 --> 16:31.656
Yeah, weird.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.993
Let me see that vial.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.622
This isn't poison.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.959
This is extract of llama.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.337
You know, in my defense,
your poisons all look alike.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.631
You might think about
relabeling some of them.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.260
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

16:53.470 --> 16:54.846
What about dinner?

16:54.930 --> 16:58.349
Kronk, this is kind of important.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.518
How about dessert?

17:00.561 --> 17:03.187
Well, I suppose there's time for dessert.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.814
And coffee?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.858
All right. A quick cup of coffee.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.986
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.202
Guess where I am right now.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.538
In the bag.

17:20.622 --> 17:23.958
Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.

17:24.542 --> 17:25.542
Hey!

17:26.920 --> 17:29.422
He's doing his own theme music?

17:38.974 --> 17:41.100
Big, dumb, and tone deaf.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.853
I am so glad
I was unconscious for all of this.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.400
Mission accomplished.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.331
You're not just gonna let him
die like that, are you?

18:03.415 --> 18:05.041
My shoulder angel.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.709
Don't listen to that guy.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.213
He's trying to lead you
down the path of righteousness.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.091
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.218
-Come off it.
-You come off it!

18:15.302 --> 18:16.302
-You.
-You.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.637
-You.
-You infinity.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.890
Listen up, big guy.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.559
I got three good reasons why
you should just walk away.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.436
Number one... Look at that guy!

18:25.521 --> 18:27.772
He's got that sissy stringy music thing.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.650
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.

18:30.734 --> 18:33.111
Right. That's a harp...

18:33.195 --> 18:34.320
And that's a dress.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.655
Robe!

18:35.739 --> 18:37.281
Reason number 2.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.616
Look what I can do.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.619
But, what does that
have to do with anything?

18:41.703 --> 18:43.788
No, no. He's got a point.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.289
Listen, you guys.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.167
You're sort of confusing me, so begone!

18:48.836 --> 18:51.337
Uh, or, you know.
However I get rid of you guys.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.131
That'll work.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.320
What's with the chimp and the bug?

19:16.363 --> 19:17.822
Can we get back to me?

19:20.075 --> 19:22.118
Oh, boy. Think, think, think.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.329
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?

19:31.295 --> 19:33.087
What am I gonna tell the village?

19:34.798 --> 19:36.674
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. Okay.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.384
What do I do? What do I do?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.391
Back! Elbow! Shoulder!

19:54.443 --> 19:56.986
Hey! Hey, you!
Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.155
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.948
Comin' through. Hey, you with the cart!

20:03.744 --> 20:05.203
This is not good.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.539
Hope that doesn't come back
to haunt me.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.593
Mom, Mom! I think I'm still growing!

21:02.636 --> 21:03.844
Measure me again!

21:04.680 --> 21:06.764
All right, Tipo. Stand still and let's see.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.558
Mom, you and I both know
that it's impossible for him

21:09.601 --> 21:11.602
to have grown in the last five minutes.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.063
Isn't it?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.107
Look how much you've grown!

21:16.191 --> 21:19.652
What? Tipo, get out of the way.
It's my turn again. Measure me.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.654
Dad's home!

21:23.115 --> 21:24.448
Hey!

21:25.867 --> 21:27.118
Come here.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.664
Dad! I ate a bug today!

21:32.124 --> 21:33.791
Was Mom baking again?

21:33.875 --> 21:35.001
Don't tell her I said that.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.460
I heard that.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.254
Okay, everybody, move aside.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.006
Lady with a baby comin' through.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.801
Dad, Dad, Dad! Look at how big I am!

21:43.885 --> 21:45.428
We were all measured today.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.888
I'm going through a growth spurt.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.057
I'm as big as you were
when you were me.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.559
Sure are.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.478
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

21:56.023 --> 21:57.732
Okay, okay, you two.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.818
Our deal was that you could stay awake
until Daddy came home.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.695
Now say good night.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.989
Dad, do we have to?

22:08.744 --> 22:10.536
No, you two can stay up.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.455
We're just gonna be sittin'
here tellin' each other

22:12.497 --> 22:14.165
how much we love each other.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.499
Right, honey?

22:17.502 --> 22:18.753
Good night.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.797
So what did the emperor want?

22:22.674 --> 22:24.884
You know what? He couldn't see me.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.345
-Couldn't see you? Why not?
-I don't know.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.888
Well, that's just rude.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.140
Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.224
No, no, no, no. No.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.977
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.187
Honey...

22:36.271 --> 22:37.730
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

22:37.814 --> 22:39.273
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.359
Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.

22:41.401 --> 22:44.028
Pacha, I'm fine.
This baby's not coming for a while,

22:44.112 --> 22:47.281
but even if it was,
I'd give that guy a piece of my mind.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.200
That kind of behavior just...

22:51.370 --> 22:53.120
I gotta go wash something.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.013
Pacha? You okay?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.642
Yeah. I'm just a little tired from the trip.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.562
I'm gonna go put Misty away.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.910
Hi. Excuse me.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.078
Two seconds here.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.080
I'm the one in the cart. Remember?

23:36.164 --> 23:38.791
This story's about me, not him.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.584
Okay. You got it? All right.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.628
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.023
Where'd you come from, little guy?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.817
No touchy.

24:05.735 --> 24:06.777
Demon llama!

24:06.820 --> 24:08.279
Demon llama? Where?

24:11.950 --> 24:14.368
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

24:15.996 --> 24:17.037
My head.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.416
Okay, demon llama. Just take it easy.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.294
I mean you no harm.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.004
What are you talking about...

24:25.422 --> 24:27.298
Wait. I know you.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.966
You're that whiny peasant.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.719
Emperor Kuzco?

24:31.803 --> 24:33.762
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

24:35.348 --> 24:36.515
How did...

24:38.101 --> 24:39.643
You don't...

24:39.728 --> 24:41.270
Look like the emperor.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.314
What do you mean
I don't look like the emperor?

24:44.483 --> 24:45.858
Do this...

24:45.942 --> 24:49.278
What is this, some kind of little game
you country folk like to...

24:49.988 --> 24:51.864
It can't be!

24:54.034 --> 24:57.161
My face! My beautiful, beautiful face!

24:57.245 --> 24:59.330
-Okay, okay, okay.
-I'm an ugly, stinky llama!

24:59.414 --> 25:00.873
Wait, okay, Your Majesty.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.333
Llama face!

25:02.375 --> 25:04.168
What happened?

25:05.045 --> 25:07.338
I'm tryin' to figure that out, okay?

25:10.675 --> 25:13.969
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.304
Wait a minute.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.805
I remember you.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.266
I remember telling you
that I was building my pool

25:19.351 --> 25:22.394
where your house was,
and then you got mad at me.

25:24.272 --> 25:26.023
And you turned me into a llama!

25:26.066 --> 25:28.025
What? No, I did not.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.818
Yes, and then you kidnapped me.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.362
Why would I kidnap a llama?

25:31.446 --> 25:34.532
I have no idea.
You're the criminal mastermind, not me.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.033
What?

25:36.868 --> 25:39.620
You're right.
That's giving you way too much credit.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.456
Okay. I have to get back to the palace.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.751
Yzma's got that "secret lab."

25:45.835 --> 25:48.712
I'll just snap my fingers
and order her to change me back.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.590
Hey, you. No time to waste. Let's go.

25:55.011 --> 25:58.722
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body.
Wouldn't you? Now let's go.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.727
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.647
You want to run that by me again?

26:08.400 --> 26:11.569
I can't let you go back
unless you change your mind

26:11.611 --> 26:14.238
and build your summer
home somewhere else.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.493
I got a little secret for you.
Come here. No, closer.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.705
I don't make deals with peasants!

26:23.373 --> 26:26.041
Then I guess I can't take you back.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.751
Fine. I don't need you.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.461
I can find my own way back.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.754
I wouldn't recommend it.

26:30.797 --> 26:33.048
It's a little dangerous
if you don't know the way.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.341
Nice try, pal.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.761
No, really. I'm telling you,
there are jaguars and snakes

26:37.804 --> 26:39.597
-and quicksand.
-I'm not listening.

26:39.639 --> 26:42.891
I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.770
Still not listening.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.439
You...

26:48.523 --> 26:50.107
Fine. Fine.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.483
Go ahead!

26:52.152 --> 26:55.654
If there's no Kuzco,
there's no Kuzcotopia.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.448
Takes care of my problem.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.298
Scary jungle. Right.

27:14.382 --> 27:17.885
A leaf. It might attack me.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.804
It's a scary tree. I'm afraid.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.643
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such,

27:25.685 --> 27:28.479
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.815
Okay, where am I?

27:35.028 --> 27:36.153
What...

27:36.237 --> 27:38.322
Help me! Help me!

27:38.365 --> 27:39.990
Help me!

27:42.744 --> 27:43.869
Too late.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.331
Okay, that was the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.257
What do you want?

27:58.760 --> 28:00.094
For me?

28:00.178 --> 28:01.970
Why, I don't know what to say.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.016
Hit the road, Bucky.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.790
No, no. No, no, no, no.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.917
No, no. No, don't.

28:43.346 --> 28:44.888
No!

29:03.324 --> 29:05.993
You killer jaguars...

29:31.978 --> 29:35.272
Don't worry, Your Highness. I gotcha.
You're safe now.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.528
Maybe I'm just new
to this whole rescuing thing,

29:41.613 --> 29:43.113
but this, to me,

29:43.156 --> 29:45.240
might be considered
kind of a step backwards,

29:45.283 --> 29:47.493
-wouldn't you say?
-No, no, no. It's okay.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.827
This is all right.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.454
We can figure this out.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.540
I hate you.

29:54.292 --> 29:57.628
No!

30:20.485 --> 30:23.487
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting all funned out.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.991
Don't tell me.
We're about to go over a huge waterfall.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.827
-Yep.
-Sharp rocks at the bottom?

30:29.869 --> 30:31.453
Most likely.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.538
Bring it on.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.363
Your Highness.

31:06.447 --> 31:08.115
Your Highness, can you hear me?

31:09.409 --> 31:11.243
Oh, boy. Come on, breathe.

31:12.662 --> 31:13.954
Breathe!

31:15.373 --> 31:16.707
Why me?

31:25.341 --> 31:26.508
All right.

31:38.563 --> 31:42.149
For the last time, it was not a kiss.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.401
Well, whatever you call it...

31:45.278 --> 31:47.362
It was disgusting.

31:47.405 --> 31:50.115
And if you would've done what
I ordered you to do in the first place,

31:50.199 --> 31:53.327
we all could've been spared
your little kiss of life.

31:56.497 --> 31:59.374
But now that you're here,
you will take me back to the palace.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.959
I'll have Yzma change me back,

32:01.044 --> 32:04.046
and then I'll start construction
on Kuzcotopia.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.213
Yeah.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.759
Okay, now, look,
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.846
I just think if you really thought about it,

32:12.931 --> 32:15.432
you'd decide to build your home
on a different hilltop.

32:15.516 --> 32:16.975
And why would I do that?

32:18.269 --> 32:20.020
Because...

32:20.104 --> 32:21.563
Deep down, I think you'll realize

32:21.606 --> 32:25.233
that you're forcing an entire village
out of their homes just for you.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.319
And that's...

32:27.987 --> 32:28.987
Bad?

32:29.072 --> 32:30.447
Well, yeah.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.909
Nobody's that heartless.

32:36.245 --> 32:37.454
Now take me back.

32:37.538 --> 32:40.082
What? Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?

32:40.124 --> 32:42.084
All you care about
is building your summer home

32:42.126 --> 32:43.710
and filling it with stuff for you.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.712
Yeah. Me.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.714
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.133
You're the only one that doesn't
seem to be with the program,

32:50.218 --> 32:51.802
Pacha?

32:51.844 --> 32:54.972
You know what? Someday,
you're going to wind up all alone,

32:55.014 --> 32:57.265
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.601
Thanks for that. I'll log that away.

32:59.644 --> 33:03.438
Now, for the final time, I order you
to take me back to the palace.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.316
Looks to me like you're stuck out here,

33:06.359 --> 33:09.111
because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

33:12.156 --> 33:15.075
Because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.952
Me, me, me.

33:19.288 --> 33:21.999
What? I didn't do anything. I didn't...

33:22.041 --> 33:23.792
Somebody's throwing stuff.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.752
You going to build a fire or what?
What's going on?

33:27.255 --> 33:29.172
He's never going to change his mind.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.844
How am I ever going to get out of here?

34:01.914 --> 34:03.707
And so, it is with great sadness

34:05.668 --> 34:09.463
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince...

34:10.715 --> 34:12.841
Taken from us so tragically

34:12.884 --> 34:15.844
on the very eve of his 18th birthday.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.179
Poor little guy.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.473
His legacy will live on in our hearts...

34:19.556 --> 34:20.766
He never had a chance.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.809
For all eternity.

34:24.812 --> 34:27.522
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.024
Back to work.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.705
Kronk, darlin',

34:43.748 --> 34:48.085
I must admit you had me worried
when you mixed up those poisons,

34:48.127 --> 34:52.547
but now that Kuzco is dead,
all is forgiven.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.299
Yeah, yeah. He's...

34:54.926 --> 34:56.510
He's dead, all right.

34:56.594 --> 35:00.639
I mean, you can't get much deader
than he is right now.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.432
Unless, of course, we killed him again.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.560
I suppose.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.938
Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.774
Kronk...

35:10.817 --> 35:12.442
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.568
Kronk...

35:13.611 --> 35:15.654
I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.

35:16.906 --> 35:19.616
Kuzco is dead, right?

35:19.659 --> 35:21.118
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.496
I need to hear these words.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.915
Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

35:27.375 --> 35:28.959
He's still alive?

35:29.043 --> 35:31.294
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.963
Kronk...

35:33.047 --> 35:36.383
I just thought I'd give you the heads-up
in case Kuzco ever came back.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.135
He can't come back!

35:38.219 --> 35:42.305
Yeah. That would be kind of awkward,
especially after that lovely eulogy.

35:42.348 --> 35:43.849
You think?

35:43.933 --> 35:47.853
You and I are going out to find him.
If he talks, we are through!

35:47.937 --> 35:49.646
Now let's move!

35:49.689 --> 35:51.815
Dad, look out!

35:52.150 --> 35:53.817
Tipo, what is it?

35:53.860 --> 35:55.986
I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log

35:56.070 --> 35:59.865
and was careening out of control
down a raging river of death!

35:59.949 --> 36:01.408
All right, all right, it's okay.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.202
-It was awful!
-It's okay, it's okay. Tipo, calm down.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.829
It was just a dream.

36:05.913 --> 36:08.498
Your dad's fine.
He just went back to see the emperor.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.296
Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.463
That's right.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.424
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.467
Yeah, like that would ever happen.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.178
It could.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.392
Good night, you two.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.476
-Night, Mom!
-Night, Mom!

36:41.866 --> 36:42.949
Hey.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.080
Thanks.

36:51.375 --> 36:52.834
No problem.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.795
Feels like wool.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.214
Yeah.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.506
Alpaca?

36:58.549 --> 36:59.966
Yeah, it is.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.384
Yeah, I thought so.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.054
It's nice.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.680
My wife made it.

37:05.723 --> 37:06.932
She knits?

37:07.016 --> 37:08.683
Crochets.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.977
Crochets? Nice.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.270
Thanks.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.195
So...

37:20.238 --> 37:24.491
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city,

37:24.575 --> 37:25.825
we'd...

37:25.910 --> 37:29.746
I mean, there's lots of hilltops,
and maybe I might, you know...

37:29.789 --> 37:31.081
I might...

37:31.123 --> 37:34.042
Are you saying...

37:34.085 --> 37:35.669
You've changed your mind?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.420
Well, I...

37:37.505 --> 37:41.925
Because you know that means you're
doing something nice for someone else.

37:42.009 --> 37:43.760
No, I know that. I know.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.929
And you're all right with that?

37:45.972 --> 37:47.264
Yes.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.604
What?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.734
Don't shake unless you mean it.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.868
All right.

38:10.579 --> 38:13.206
Let's get you back to the palace.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.083
By the way, thanks.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.711
No...

38:17.795 --> 38:19.462
Thank you.

38:32.059 --> 38:35.312
Okay. Once we cross this bridge,
it's only an hour to the palace.

38:35.354 --> 38:37.689
Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.

38:37.773 --> 38:38.815
I believe it.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.150
-What was that?
-Nothing.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.654
Kuzco!

38:46.198 --> 38:47.824
Kuzco!

38:47.867 --> 38:49.492
-Yeah?
-Quick, help me up!

38:51.245 --> 38:53.163
No. I don't think I will.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.497
You're going to leave me here?

38:54.540 --> 38:56.833
Well, I was going to have
you imprisoned for life,

38:56.876 --> 38:58.543
but I kind of like this better.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.503
I thought you were a changed man.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.757
Come on. I had to say something
to get you to take me back to the city.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.592
So all of it was a lie?

39:05.676 --> 39:07.761
Well, yeah. No, wait.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.931
Yeah, yeah. It all was a lie.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.224
Toodles.

39:13.309 --> 39:15.560
We shook hands on it!

39:19.106 --> 39:21.983
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is...

39:22.026 --> 39:23.651
You need hands.

39:24.236 --> 39:26.488
Okay. Buh-bye.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.283
Are you okay? Are you all right?

39:30.368 --> 39:32.410
Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm all right.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.120
Good!

39:34.205 --> 39:36.164
That's for going back on your promise!

39:37.375 --> 39:40.794
Yeah. That's for kidnapping me
and taking me to your village...

39:40.878 --> 39:43.713
Which I'm still gonna destroy,
by the way.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.048
No touchy.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.760
Why did I risk my life
for a selfish brat like you?

39:48.844 --> 39:50.637
I was always taught that there
was some good in everyone,

39:50.721 --> 39:52.347
but, you proved me wrong.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.600
Now I feel really bad. Bad llama.

39:55.684 --> 39:57.477
I could've let you die
out there in that jungle,

39:57.561 --> 39:59.396
and then all my problems
would be over.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.564
Well, that makes you ugly and stupid.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.066
Let's end this.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.275
Ladies first.

40:30.678 --> 40:31.970
What are we gonna do?

40:34.014 --> 40:35.807
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

40:35.891 --> 40:39.102
We're gonna die! That's it for me!

40:39.687 --> 40:41.771
No, we're not. Calm down.

40:41.814 --> 40:45.024
I have an idea. Give me your arm.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.527
Okay, now the other one.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.698
When I say go, push against my back,

40:51.782 --> 40:54.909
and we'll walk up the hill. Ready?

40:54.952 --> 40:56.035
Go.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.580
You did that on purpose.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.416
No, I didn't!

41:01.625 --> 41:04.961
Now, we're gonna have to work together
to get out of this, so follow my lead.

41:05.045 --> 41:06.212
Ready?

41:06.297 --> 41:07.464
-Right foot.
-Whose right?

41:07.548 --> 41:09.048
Your right or mine?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.383
I don't care. Mine.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.551
Well, why yours?

41:11.635 --> 41:12.802
Okay, your right! Ready?

41:12.845 --> 41:15.472
-Okay, got it.
-Okay, right.

41:15.514 --> 41:17.182
Left. Right.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.101
Look, we're moving!

41:21.687 --> 41:24.689
Don't look down! Now, stay with me.
Stay with me.

41:24.773 --> 41:26.441
Right. Left.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.151
Right. Left.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.153
Right. Left.

41:30.237 --> 41:31.905
Right!

41:32.323 --> 41:34.991
Now what, genius?

41:35.075 --> 41:36.993
Working on it.

41:37.036 --> 41:39.162
Okay, here's the deal.

41:39.205 --> 41:42.373
Stretch out your neck,
and I'll grab the rope.

41:42.458 --> 41:45.210
How do I know you won't let me fall
after you grab the rope?

41:45.294 --> 41:48.338
You're just gonna have to trust me!

41:51.133 --> 41:54.177
You know, it's a good thing
you're not a big, fat guy,

41:54.220 --> 41:56.679
or this would be really difficult.

41:58.265 --> 41:59.766
Almost.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.267
Got it!

42:01.977 --> 42:03.394
It's stuck.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.480
Take your time. No hurry here.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.234
Scorpions!

42:09.443 --> 42:10.527
Kuzco!

42:11.987 --> 42:13.112
Oh, no!

42:43.018 --> 42:44.686
Look out!

42:49.316 --> 42:51.734
Yeah! Look at me and my bad self.

42:51.819 --> 42:54.696
I snatched you right out of the air.

42:54.738 --> 42:58.116
"I'm a crumbly canyon wall,
and I'm taking you with me."

42:58.200 --> 42:59.576
Well, not today, pal.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.998
You just saved my life.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.585
So?

43:08.669 --> 43:09.919
-I knew it.
-Knew what?

43:09.962 --> 43:11.421
That there is some good in you after all.

43:11.463 --> 43:12.589
-Oh, no.
-Admit it.

43:12.673 --> 43:14.132
-Wrong.
-Yes, there is.

43:14.216 --> 43:15.550
I think there is.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.884
Hey, you could've let me fall.

43:16.927 --> 43:19.846
Come on, what's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless.

43:21.890 --> 43:25.059
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.

43:25.519 --> 43:27.687
Right. Sure.

43:27.771 --> 43:29.772
Well, we better get going.

43:29.815 --> 43:33.192
With that bridge out,
it's a four-day walk to the palace.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.695
What?
You mean you're still taking me back?

43:35.779 --> 43:37.238
I shook on it, didn't I?

43:37.281 --> 43:40.908
Well, yeah, but I hope you realize
that doesn't change a thing.

43:40.951 --> 43:43.786
I'm still building Kuzcotopia
when I get back.

43:43.871 --> 43:45.538
Well, four days is a long time.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.457
Who knows?
Maybe you'll change your mind.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.001
Four days.

43:50.085 --> 43:51.919
What are the chances
of you carrying me?

43:51.962 --> 43:53.421
Not good.

43:55.633 --> 43:56.966
No, no, no!

43:57.968 --> 44:00.261
We've searched every village
surrounding the palace

44:00.304 --> 44:02.305
and still no sign of Kuzco.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.557
Where is he?

44:04.683 --> 44:05.725
Kronk!

44:05.809 --> 44:06.809
Kronk here.

44:06.852 --> 44:08.895
I'm getting tired. Pull over.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.313
Sure thing. Kronk out.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.201
Perfect.

44:23.285 --> 44:26.079
These are my best shoes.

44:27.706 --> 44:30.500
I hate this jungle.

44:32.252 --> 44:33.378
Look.

44:33.462 --> 44:35.505
A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

44:35.547 --> 44:38.299
Just one more for exotic bird bingo.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.051
I am loving this.

44:48.769 --> 44:50.520
Get away from me!

44:53.941 --> 44:55.066
Yeah. Tell me about it.

44:56.985 --> 44:58.486
No, no, it's not you.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.780
She's not the easiest person
to get close to.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.865
There's a wall there. Trust me.

45:02.908 --> 45:05.535
Are you talking to that squirrel?

45:05.577 --> 45:07.495
I was a Junior Chipmunk.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.206
I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

45:10.290 --> 45:11.457
Please continue.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.839
Why me? Why me?

45:17.881 --> 45:20.383
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.260
This poor little guy has had it rough.

45:22.344 --> 45:25.304
Seems a talking llama
gave him a hard time the other day.

45:26.807 --> 45:29.642
A talking llama? Do tell.

45:33.313 --> 45:35.189
He doesn't really want to talk to you.

45:35.232 --> 45:37.400
Well, then you ask him.

45:38.485 --> 45:39.652
I hate being in the middle.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.070
Squeaky,

45:41.155 --> 45:42.822
squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.910
Jaguars? No kidding? Brutal.

45:55.502 --> 45:57.754
Could you give us a little room here?

45:57.796 --> 45:59.088
Sorry.

46:01.425 --> 46:02.759
A little bit more, please.

46:04.344 --> 46:06.012
How is this?

46:06.096 --> 46:07.263
Yeah, that's good.

46:07.347 --> 46:11.058
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

46:11.226 --> 46:13.311
Squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.

46:26.033 --> 46:27.283
Low blood sugar, huh?

46:27.326 --> 46:28.993
Yeah. It's a curse.

46:29.077 --> 46:30.578
Well, as soon as we get
something to eat,

46:30.621 --> 46:32.288
you're walking the rest of the way.

46:44.301 --> 46:48.596
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut,
home of the mug...

46:49.973 --> 46:52.683
Of meat. What'll it be?

46:53.435 --> 46:56.854
We'll have two specials.
Is that all right, dear?

46:56.939 --> 46:59.106
Whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.151
We're on our honeymoon.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.654
Bless you for coming out in public.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.490
So that's two specials.

47:07.574 --> 47:10.034
And an onion log. To split.

47:12.079 --> 47:17.333
Ordering! I need two heartburns
and a deep-fried doorstop on table 12!

47:20.170 --> 47:22.338
Okay, so I'll admit this was a good idea.

47:22.422 --> 47:25.341
When will you learn
that all my ideas are good ones?

47:25.384 --> 47:26.467
That's funny,

47:26.510 --> 47:28.845
because I thought you going
into the jungle by yourself,

47:28.887 --> 47:30.513
being chased by jaguars,

47:30.597 --> 47:32.515
lying to me
to take you back to the palace

47:32.599 --> 47:33.850
were all really bad ideas.

47:33.892 --> 47:36.936
Anything sounds bad
when you say it with that attitude.

47:37.354 --> 47:41.274
Hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple.

47:46.822 --> 47:48.322
Boy.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.374
Here. Let me get that for you.

48:01.837 --> 48:02.879
Where are you going?

48:02.921 --> 48:05.298
I'm just going to slip into the kitchen
and have a word with the chef.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.883
You're gonna get us thrown out.

48:06.925 --> 48:10.511
Please. With this disguise, I'm invisible.

48:17.686 --> 48:20.313
We've been walking around in circles
for who knows how long.

48:20.397 --> 48:24.191
That is the last time
we take directions from a squirrel.

48:24.234 --> 48:27.904
I should have done away with Kuzco
myself when I had the chance.

48:30.449 --> 48:32.909
You really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

48:36.246 --> 48:38.039
I'll get you another one there, Yzma.

48:38.999 --> 48:41.042
You using that fork there, pal?

48:41.084 --> 48:42.376
Hey, don't I know you?

48:42.419 --> 48:43.586
I don't think so.

48:43.629 --> 48:45.922
-Wrestled you in high school?
-Don't remember that.

48:46.006 --> 48:47.340
Metal shop? I got it!

48:47.424 --> 48:49.675
Miss Narca's interpretive dance,
two semesters.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.802
I was usually in the back
because of my weak ankles.

48:51.887 --> 48:54.055
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

48:54.097 --> 48:57.016
I don't think we've ever met,
but I gotta go.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.351
Don't worry. I'll think of it.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.770
Look, all I know is the food looked iffy.

49:00.812 --> 49:02.772
I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.065
Hey!

49:04.107 --> 49:05.900
So I'm just checking to make sure

49:05.943 --> 49:07.818
you're going to take
the main course up a notch.

49:07.903 --> 49:11.572
Is there anything on this menu
that is not swimming in gravy?

49:11.615 --> 49:13.074
Hang on. I'll go ask the chef.

49:13.116 --> 49:14.283
It's a simple question.

49:14.368 --> 49:18.120
Is there or is there not anything edible
on this menu?

49:20.958 --> 49:22.792
Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet!

49:23.543 --> 49:25.920
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

49:25.963 --> 49:27.838
All right, buster, that's it!

49:27.923 --> 49:30.424
You want a special order,
then you make it! I quit!

49:30.467 --> 49:31.509
Yeah, but I...

49:31.593 --> 49:35.304
I try and I try, but there's no respect
for anyone with vision. That's it!

49:35.389 --> 49:36.973
There's just nothing I can do about it!

49:37.265 --> 49:38.391
Please don't go.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.726
Three pork combos,
extra bacon on the side,

49:40.811 --> 49:43.771
two chili cheese samplers,
a basket of liver and onion rings,

49:43.814 --> 49:46.816
a catch of the day,
and a steak cut in the shape of a trout.

49:47.943 --> 49:49.026
You got all that, honey?

49:49.111 --> 49:50.861
Three oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air,

49:50.988 --> 49:53.656
basket of grandma's breakfast,
and change the bull to a gill, got it.

49:53.699 --> 49:54.824
What's going on?

49:54.908 --> 49:56.826
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

49:57.619 --> 49:59.412
What is he doing in there?

50:03.667 --> 50:05.876
-Come on!
-In a minute. I'm still hungry.

50:05.961 --> 50:07.044
No, Kuzco!

50:07.129 --> 50:08.629
Okay, I'll make it simple for you.

50:08.672 --> 50:10.631
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast.

50:10.674 --> 50:12.466
-You got it?
-Can do.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.969
What's taking so long?

50:15.012 --> 50:17.304
-Pickup!
-Kronk! What are you doing?

50:17.347 --> 50:19.682
-Kinda busy here.
-Why am I not surprised?

50:19.725 --> 50:20.975
Your order's up!

50:22.644 --> 50:24.228
Well, while you're at it,

50:24.312 --> 50:26.689
make me the special.
And hold the gravy!

50:26.773 --> 50:28.024
Check. Pickup!

50:28.150 --> 50:30.526
You know what? On second thought,
make my omelet a meat pie.

50:30.610 --> 50:31.694
Meat pie. Check.

50:31.778 --> 50:33.070
Kronk!

50:33.864 --> 50:35.906
Can I order the potatoes as a side dish?

50:35.991 --> 50:37.366
I'll have to charge you full price.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.869
Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

50:39.911 --> 50:41.662
You got it.
Want cheese on those potatoes?

50:41.705 --> 50:43.372
Thank you, Kronk. Cheddar will be fine.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.207
-Cheddar spuds coming up.
-Spuds yes, cheese no.

50:45.250 --> 50:47.251
-Hold the cheese.
-No, I want the cheese.

50:47.335 --> 50:48.461
Cheese me no like.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.628
-Cheese out.
-Cheese in!

50:49.713 --> 50:50.796
Come on, make up your mind!

50:50.881 --> 50:52.048
Okay, okay, on second thought...

50:52.090 --> 50:53.591
Make my potatoes a salad.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.859
Excuse me.
You see that woman over there?

51:13.904 --> 51:16.238
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

51:21.411 --> 51:22.745
One, two, three, four...

51:22.788 --> 51:25.081
Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you

51:25.123 --> 51:27.750
We wish it was our birthday
So we could party, too

51:27.793 --> 51:30.211
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true

51:31.797 --> 51:33.422
It's your birthday?

51:35.300 --> 51:37.093
What are you doing?

51:37.135 --> 51:38.886
Look, there's two people
in there looking for you.

51:38.929 --> 51:40.888
-What?
-A big guy and a skinny old woman.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.099
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

51:43.183 --> 51:46.185
-Yeah.
-That's Yzma and Kronk! I'm saved!

51:46.269 --> 51:48.020
Trust me, they're not here to save you.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.605
They'll take me back to the palace.

51:49.648 --> 51:51.315
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.

51:51.399 --> 51:52.441
I can take it from here.

51:52.484 --> 51:55.194
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

51:55.278 --> 51:56.904
Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.

51:56.947 --> 52:00.241
-No. I can't let you!
-What? Wha...

52:00.492 --> 52:02.326
I get it!

52:02.702 --> 52:04.537
You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

52:04.621 --> 52:06.956
You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.

52:06.998 --> 52:08.165
No!

52:08.250 --> 52:09.708
This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.

52:09.793 --> 52:11.127
Will you just listen to me...

52:11.169 --> 52:14.588
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is your stupid hilltop!

52:14.631 --> 52:15.714
What?

52:15.799 --> 52:17.967
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.

52:18.009 --> 52:19.051
-Go!
-But...

52:19.136 --> 52:21.220
Go on! Get outta here!

52:21.471 --> 52:22.721
Fine!

52:24.516 --> 52:27.351
-This entire mess is all your fault.
-What'd I do?

52:27.435 --> 52:31.313
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
Kuzco would be dead now!

52:31.356 --> 52:36.110
There'll be no more diversions until
we track that llama down and kill him!

52:36.153 --> 52:38.320
Said I was sorry. Can't just let it go.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.322
Not even on your birthday.

52:40.365 --> 52:42.575
Kuzco must be eliminated.

52:42.659 --> 52:45.786
The empire will finally be
rid of that useless slug.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.329
You got a point.

52:47.372 --> 52:49.665
Nobody really seems to care
that he's gone, do they?

52:53.170 --> 52:54.920
Pacha!

52:58.925 --> 53:00.509
Pacha?

53:38.215 --> 53:40.216
So this is where you came in.

53:40.258 --> 53:43.219
See, just like I said, I'm the victim here.

53:43.261 --> 53:45.221
I didn't do anything,
and they ruined my life

53:45.305 --> 53:46.388
and took everything I had.

53:46.431 --> 53:48.015
Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?

53:48.058 --> 53:50.392
What? I'm just telling them
what happened.

53:50.477 --> 53:51.894
Who you kidding, pal?

53:51.937 --> 53:54.271
They saw the whole thing,
they know what happened.

53:54.356 --> 53:56.106
Well, yeah, but...

53:56.191 --> 53:57.900
Just leave me alone.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.430
The peasant at the diner!

54:30.350 --> 54:31.934
He didn't pay his check.

54:43.947 --> 54:45.614
He's the peasant
who I saw leaving the city

54:45.657 --> 54:48.993
who disappeared into the crowd
with Kuzco on the back of his cart.

54:49.077 --> 54:50.494
He must have taken him
back to his village,

54:50.578 --> 54:54.623
so if we find the village, we find him,
and if we find him, we find Kuzco.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.668
Yeah, it's all comin' together.

54:59.087 --> 55:00.879
-Yzma!
-What?

55:02.299 --> 55:04.300
This had better be good!

56:10.575 --> 56:14.495
So, there we were standing on the cliff,
and the ground started to rumble.

56:14.537 --> 56:18.582
And just as it started to go,
he grabbed me before I fell.

56:18.666 --> 56:20.709
Do you believe that?

56:20.752 --> 56:23.754
You know, call me crazy for following
this guy all the way out here,

56:23.838 --> 56:27.716
but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him.

56:27.801 --> 56:31.011
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

56:31.054 --> 56:33.180
He's a lousy llama.

56:33.223 --> 56:36.809
I mean, a really lousy llama.

56:49.114 --> 56:51.323
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know,

56:51.408 --> 56:55.411
what I said to you back at the diner,
that, I didn't really...

56:56.913 --> 56:59.790
So, you tired of being a llama?

57:00.875 --> 57:03.585
Yes!

57:04.671 --> 57:07.339
Okay, we're just gonna stop
at the house and get some supplies.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.383
-Then we'll be on our way, right?
-Right.

57:09.426 --> 57:12.094
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

57:12.178 --> 57:13.303
My relatives?

57:13.388 --> 57:15.264
We just sent them up to your house.

57:15.348 --> 57:16.432
What did they look like?

57:16.474 --> 57:20.227
See, there was this big guy
and this older woman who was...

57:20.270 --> 57:22.062
How would you describe her?

57:22.105 --> 57:23.564
Scary beyond all reason.

57:23.606 --> 57:25.023
Yeah, that's it.

57:25.525 --> 57:28.318
So, remind me again
how you're related to Pacha?

57:29.737 --> 57:32.614
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's
wife's step-niece's great-aunt.

57:34.451 --> 57:35.826
Twice removed.

57:38.163 --> 57:39.955
Isn't that right, Kronk?

57:39.998 --> 57:42.624
Ninety-nine monkeys
jumpin' on the bed

57:42.667 --> 57:45.502
One fell off and bumped his head

57:45.587 --> 57:48.755
You know, I am so sorry
that you had to come all this way,

57:48.798 --> 57:51.300
but as I said to you before,

57:51.342 --> 57:53.886
you may recall, Pacha is not here.

57:53.970 --> 57:56.138
I'll be sure and tell him you came by.

57:56.181 --> 57:59.641
Would you, please?
That would be just great.

58:01.352 --> 58:02.436
Silly me.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.771
No, no. Allow me.

58:09.444 --> 58:10.569
She's hiding something.

58:10.653 --> 58:12.488
When I give the word,
we search the house.

58:12.530 --> 58:14.656
Okay, but I still have 94 monkeys to go.

58:16.910 --> 58:18.994
So, while we're waiting for Paca...

58:19.078 --> 58:22.289
-Pacha.
-Yes.

58:22.332 --> 58:24.833
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

58:24.876 --> 58:28.253
You know, why don't you just come
back when Pacha gets home?

58:28.338 --> 58:31.381
I'm sure he'd love to show you the...

58:32.175 --> 58:33.717
Excuse me, won't you?

58:33.801 --> 58:35.677
I think I left something in the oven.

58:36.596 --> 58:40.307
This is my variation of double-dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.

58:40.350 --> 58:42.100
-Kronk, it's time!
-Okay!

58:44.270 --> 58:47.731
So, we have to get back to the palace,
find the lab, and change him back.

58:47.815 --> 58:49.024
Hi there!

58:50.485 --> 58:51.693
That was him.

58:53.863 --> 58:54.988
You know what?

58:55.031 --> 58:57.491
I don't believe
you're really my great-aunt.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.826
You're more like my great-great-great...

58:59.869 --> 59:02.621
Go. I'll stall them long enough
for you two to get a head start.

59:02.705 --> 59:04.039
Thanks, honey.

59:04.082 --> 59:07.000
You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.

59:07.544 --> 59:10.045
Great-great-great...

59:10.129 --> 59:12.881
All right! Are you through?

59:12.966 --> 59:14.883
-Great-great-aunt.
-So, where were we?

59:14.968 --> 59:16.510
Listen, sister, we're not leaving until...

59:16.553 --> 59:18.554
I show you the house. Of course.

59:19.305 --> 59:21.890
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

59:21.975 --> 59:24.351
Don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

59:25.103 --> 59:28.438
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.

59:28.523 --> 59:30.232
There is no handle in here.

59:30.316 --> 59:32.568
There's not? Are you sure?

59:32.652 --> 59:34.570
All right, I've had enough of this.

59:34.904 --> 59:38.073
Tell us where the talking llama is and
we'll burn your house to the ground.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.742
Don't you mean "or"?

59:40.785 --> 59:44.496
Tell us where the talking llama is
or we'll burn your house to the ground.

59:44.581 --> 59:45.581
Well, which is it?

59:45.665 --> 59:47.499
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.794
That's it! Kronk, break the door down!

59:50.878 --> 59:53.922
Break it down? Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.

59:53.965 --> 59:56.091
I don't care, you fool. Get out of my way.

59:56.175 --> 59:58.176
I'll break it down myself.

59:58.261 --> 01:00:00.887
-A-one...
-Okay, kids, you know what to do.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.889
-Two...
-Right, Mom!

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.474
Three!

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:20.907
Okay, children, on your mark,
get set, go!

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.453
Stop it, you little brats!

01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:31.126
There they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:34.713
Well, I had a great time.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:38.008
Let's not wait until the next
family reunion to get together.

01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:39.217
Kronk!

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.428
I gotta run.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:53.208
Okay, why does she even
have that lever?

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.253
Please remain seated

01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:58.255
and keep your arms
and legs in at all times.

01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:09.266
-What does it look like?
-I don't know. Just keep looking.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:10.559
Over here!

01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:14.563
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:16.732
Oh, my.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.650
Looking for this?

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.654
No! It can't be!

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.614
How did you get back here before us?

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:27.909
How did we, Kronk?

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:31.204
Well, you got me.
By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.957
Well, back to business.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:35.292
Okay, I admit it.

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:37.043
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:39.921
but, Yzma,
do you really want to kill me?

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:43.258
Just think of it as you're being let go,

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:45.594
that your life's going
in a different direction,

01:02:45.636 --> 01:02:49.306
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:52.601
Hey, that's kind of like what he said
to you when you got fired.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:57.564
I know. It's called a cruel irony
like my dependence on you.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.274
I can't believe this is happening!

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:01.443
Then I bet you weren't expecting this.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.570
No!

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:06.281
Okay.

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.617
Finish them off.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:13.330
Hey, you're not backing down now,
are you, big guy?

01:03:15.082 --> 01:03:16.333
Where's the other guy?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.252
Yo!

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.213
Sorry I'm late. So, what'd I miss?

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.964
Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife

01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:25.300
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:28.094
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.346
and quite honestly...

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:32.390
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.934
This one simple thing.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.435
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:36.603
Now.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.564
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:41.900
And do you want to know
something else?

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.985
I've never liked your spinach puffs.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.446
Never!

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.367
That's it. She's going down.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:51.952
Now, now, remember, guys.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:55.205
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

01:03:58.459 --> 01:03:59.709
That'll work.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.802
Strange. That usually works.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.262
And so does this!

01:04:11.305 --> 01:04:13.139
Should have seen that coming.

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:17.727
Give me that vial!

01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:28.780
Clumsy me.

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.242
Which one? Which one?

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:37.831
Better hurry. I'm expecting company.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.879
Kill them! They murdered the emperor!

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:47.841
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me... Kuzco!

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.217
They're not listening to me!

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.219
Just take 'em all!

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.103
Get them!

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:03.315
Hey, I've been turned into a cow.
Can I go home?

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.859
You're excused. Anyone else?

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.360
No, we're good.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:08.737
Get them!

01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:11.489
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.036
Pacha? A little help!

01:05:18.497 --> 01:05:20.123
Come on! Come on!

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.716
Please be something with wings.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:35.055
Yeah! We're flyin'!

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.688
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.649
-I'm picking the next one!
-Fine by me!

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:46.858
Give me that one!

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:50.612
Don't you say a word.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.494
Quick! Drain the canals!

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.288
Open up!

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:06.086
I'm a llama again!

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:07.295
Wait...

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.973
There they go! After them!

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:21.476
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:42.163
Okay, only two left.
It's gotta be one of these.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:48.378
No!

01:06:59.056 --> 01:07:00.932
I'll take that.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.476
This is the one.
This'll change you back to a human.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.605
Hey, get her off!

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:09.733
Get her off me!

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.784
Drink the potion!

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.411
Okay, okay.

01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:23.038
Where did it go? Where is it?

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:25.582
Looking for this?

01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:29.127
Is that my voice? Is that my voice?

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:31.087
Well.

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:32.547
No! Don't drop it!

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.008
I'm not going to drop it, you fool!

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:37.052
I'm going to drink it!

01:07:37.094 --> 01:07:39.888
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self,

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:42.557
I'm going to kill you!

01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:17.008
Kuzco!

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.551
Be right there! Give me a minute!

01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:22.471
Kuzco!

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:26.392
Kuzco!

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:34.442
The vial!

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:46.371
For the last time,
we did not order a giant trampoline.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:49.916
You know, pal, you could have told me
that before I set it up.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.724
The vial!

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:08.893
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.080
I win.

01:09:31.876 --> 01:09:33.751
Got it!

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:36.754
What are the odds of that
trapdoor leading me out here?

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.508
Yeah!

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:46.890
Here, let me get this for you.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:52.437
Well, see ya on the other side.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:05.950
Now, you stop being so hard
on yourself. All is forgiven.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.243
You're sure?

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:09.829
It's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.539
and it won't be the last.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:13.625
What can I say? I'm a rebel.

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:15.418
Tiger.

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:17.128
Hey, I got to use that arm later.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.922
Okay, buddy, take care.

01:10:20.257 --> 01:10:21.758
He's a sweet guy.

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:33.728
So, you lied to me.

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:37.440
-I did?
-Yeah.

01:10:37.524 --> 01:10:41.069
You said when the sun hits this ridge
just right, these hills sing.

01:10:41.111 --> 01:10:43.321
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills,

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.448
and I did not hear any singing.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:50.036
So...

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:54.916
I'll be building my summer home
on a more magical hill. Thank you.

01:10:58.212 --> 01:11:00.380
Couldn't pull the wool over your eyes?

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.423
No, no, I'm sharp, I'm on it.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:03.633
Looks like you and your family

01:11:03.717 --> 01:11:06.010
are stuck on that tuneless
hilltop forever, pal.

01:11:14.853 --> 01:11:19.023
You know, I'm pretty sure I heard
some singing on the hill next to us.

01:11:20.025 --> 01:11:21.526
In case you're interested.

01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:28.241
Boom, baby!

01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:30.618
Boom, baby!

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:36.582
You'd be the coolest dude
In the nation

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.710
Or the hippest cat in creation

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:42.130
But if you ain't got friends
then nothing's worth the fuss

01:11:43.507 --> 01:11:45.758
A perfect world will come to be

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:47.844
When everybody here can see

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:50.221
That a perfect world begins and ends

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.515
A perfect world begins and ends

01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:55.351
A perfect world begins
and ends with us

01:11:56.937 --> 01:11:58.604
"My acorn is missing."

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.565
Squeak squeakin' squeak squeakity.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.191
"Did you eat the acorn?"

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.319
Squeaker squeak squeak squeakin'?

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.237
"You owe me a new acorn."

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.531
Squeak squeak squeak squeak
squeaker...

01:12:10.784 --> 01:12:11.784
Squeakin'.

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:13.286
I'm so proud of you guys.
