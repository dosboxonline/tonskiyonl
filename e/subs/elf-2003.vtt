WEBVTT

00:28.034 --> 00:28.618
Oh, hello.

00:28.618 --> 00:30.536
You're, uh, you're probably here

00:30.536 --> 00:33.289
About the, Uh, the story.

00:33.289 --> 00:34.748
Elves love to tell stories.

00:34.748 --> 00:37.542
I-I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

00:37.542 --> 00:40.086
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

00:40.086 --> 00:42.130
You... you didn't know about elves.

00:42.130 --> 00:46.843
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

00:46.843 --> 00:52.264
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

00:52.264 --> 00:53.807
The first is making shoes at night

00:53.807 --> 00:55.517
While, you know, while the old...

00:55.517 --> 00:57.185
The old cobbler sleeps.

00:57.185 --> 01:00.230
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

01:00.230 --> 01:01.856
You can bake cookies

01:01.856 --> 01:02.691
In a tree. Hey!

01:02.691 --> 01:05.777
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

01:05.777 --> 01:08.279
In an oak tree during the dry season.

01:08.279 --> 01:10.031
Screaming I wanna make shoes!

01:10.031 --> 01:12.575
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

01:12.575 --> 01:14.827
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

01:14.827 --> 01:18.205
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,

01:18.205 --> 01:23.084
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.295
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

01:25.837 --> 01:28.798
I-it's a job only an elf can do.

01:28.798 --> 01:29.674
Our... our nimble fingers,

01:29.674 --> 01:31.634
Natural cheer and active minds

01:31.634 --> 01:33.761
Are perfect for toy-building.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.722
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

01:36.722 --> 01:39.599
But the gnomes drank too much...

01:41.142 --> 01:43.937
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

01:44.395 --> 01:49.567
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.361
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

01:52.361 --> 01:54.405
And, as you may have guessed,

01:54.405 --> 01:58.325
That's where our story begins.

02:30.396 --> 02:31.856
Wow!

02:34.650 --> 02:36.193
Whoa!

03:12.685 --> 03:14.728
Ooh!

03:14.728 --> 03:15.813
Wow!

03:15.813 --> 03:17.397
Wow!

03:23.445 --> 03:25.238
Humming

03:25.238 --> 03:28.491
Ow! Ow!

03:42.462 --> 03:43.880
Whoa!

03:46.758 --> 03:48.968
Are you sleepy?

03:50.011 --> 03:50.761
Here we are.

03:50.761 --> 03:55.349
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

03:55.349 --> 03:58.185
Here we are.

03:58.185 --> 03:59.436
There you are.

03:59.436 --> 04:02.689
It's time to go to sleep.

04:02.689 --> 04:06.234
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

04:12.531 --> 04:16.493
Merry Christmas, my angel.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.419
Creaking

04:43.059 --> 04:45.895
Santa: Mmm...

04:51.734 --> 04:53.777
Bars clang

05:15.047 --> 05:17.924
Cheering music playing

05:24.514 --> 05:27.308
All right, all right.

05:27.308 --> 05:30.811
We've had another very successful
year.

05:30.811 --> 05:32.605
Cheering

05:32.605 --> 05:34.565
So, after all that hard work,

05:34.565 --> 05:37.776
It's time to start preparations

05:37.776 --> 05:39.403
For next Christmas!

05:39.403 --> 05:42.864
Cheering

05:48.286 --> 05:52.957
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

05:54.333 --> 05:56.793
Elves: Wow...

05:59.546 --> 06:01.840
Male elf: A baby...

06:04.467 --> 06:06.844
Elf: "little buddy diapers."

06:06.844 --> 06:08.971
His name is buddy. He must've...

06:08.971 --> 06:11.348
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

06:11.348 --> 06:11.849
What do we do?

06:11.849 --> 06:15.018
Papa elf: So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

06:15.018 --> 06:17.104
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

06:17.104 --> 06:18.438
Santa's a... a pushover.

06:18.438 --> 06:20.649
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

06:20.649 --> 06:21.608
Who had always wanted a child?

06:21.608 --> 06:24.152
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

06:24.152 --> 06:28.990
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

06:28.990 --> 06:29.615
Santa.

06:29.615 --> 06:32.868
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

06:32.868 --> 06:35.120
I was his adopted father.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.872
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

06:36.872 --> 06:41.084
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

06:41.084 --> 06:44.170
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.381
I mean, not... not really.

06:46.381 --> 06:48.132
Before we learn how to build
The latest

06:48.132 --> 06:50.134
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

06:50.134 --> 06:52.887
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

06:52.887 --> 06:53.929
Shall we?

06:53.929 --> 06:54.596
Number one.

06:54.596 --> 06:57.557
"Treat every day like Christmas."

06:57.557 --> 06:58.350
Number two.

06:58.350 --> 07:02.354
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

07:02.354 --> 07:03.480
Number three.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.858
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

07:06.858 --> 07:10.695
Is singing loud for all to hear."

07:10.945 --> 07:12.863
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

07:12.863 --> 07:16.200
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.951
I've never been in this room
before.

07:17.951 --> 07:19.911
Well, I think it's time you start

07:19.911 --> 07:21.871
Your tinker training.

07:22.539 --> 07:25.959
Gasps Santa's sleigh.

07:25.959 --> 07:28.586
You're gonna help me make it fly.

07:30.379 --> 07:32.673
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

07:32.673 --> 07:35.467
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

07:35.467 --> 07:39.971
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

07:39.971 --> 07:43.141
Well, silly as it sounds,

07:43.141 --> 07:44.142
A lot of people down south

07:44.142 --> 07:46.060
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

07:46.060 --> 07:47.895
What?!

07:47.895 --> 07:51.107
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

07:51.107 --> 07:52.900
Well, there's a rumor floating around

07:52.900 --> 07:54.943
That, uh, that the parents do it.

07:54.943 --> 07:56.904
That's... that's ridiculous.

07:56.904 --> 07:59.906
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

07:59.906 --> 08:01.032
What about Santa's cookies?

08:01.032 --> 08:03.493
I suppose parents eat them, too?

08:03.493 --> 08:04.577
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

08:04.577 --> 08:07.038
Uh, and every earless and less
People

08:07.038 --> 08:07.747
Believe in Santa Claus.

08:07.747 --> 08:11.167
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

08:11.167 --> 08:11.667
Oh.

08:11.667 --> 08:15.629
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.673
That's shocking.

08:17.673 --> 08:19.174
That's why I came up

08:19.174 --> 08:21.593
With this little beauty in the '60s.

08:21.593 --> 08:25.096
Engine hums to life

08:26.180 --> 08:27.473
WH-what is it?

08:27.473 --> 08:28.975
It's a cringle 3000...

08:28.975 --> 08:32.645
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.188
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

08:34.188 --> 08:38.107
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

08:39.985 --> 08:41.068
Well, it looks like we got

08:41.068 --> 08:43.071
A short in the thermo coupler.

08:43.071 --> 08:45.573
You wanna give me a hand with that?

08:45.573 --> 08:47.075
You want me to help?

08:47.075 --> 08:49.452
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

08:49.452 --> 08:52.037
By his family and friends,

08:52.037 --> 08:53.747
There were a few drawbacks

08:53.747 --> 08:57.542
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

08:57.542 --> 09:00.504
Music plays chattering

09:18.603 --> 09:20.730
Hey, Ming Ming.

09:20.730 --> 09:21.731
Um...

09:21.731 --> 09:26.069
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

09:26.069 --> 09:27.153
It's all right, buddy.

09:27.153 --> 09:28.696
Just how many etch-a-sketches

09:28.696 --> 09:31.699
Did you get finished?

09:31.699 --> 09:35.202
Come on, buddy. How many?

09:35.202 --> 09:39.498
I made, uh... 85.

09:45.003 --> 09:47.046
Eighty-five?

09:47.755 --> 09:49.590
That puts you...

09:50.299 --> 09:51.592
915 off the pace.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.135
Female elf: Ooh... that's bad.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.553
Why don't you just say it?

09:54.553 --> 09:56.805
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.599
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.142
Gasps

10:00.142 --> 10:03.019
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.105
We all just have different talents
That's all.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.065
Seems like everyone else

10:07.065 --> 10:08.524
Have the same talents
except for me.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.318
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

10:11.318 --> 10:14.863
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

10:14.863 --> 10:15.656
Special talents?

10:15.656 --> 10:18.367
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.159
You sure did... aaa's.

10:19.159 --> 10:22.370
And in six months, you'll have
to check'em again...

10:22.370 --> 10:23.121
Won't he?

10:23.121 --> 10:25.832
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

10:25.832 --> 10:28.084
You bring us down whole octave.

10:28.084 --> 10:30.086
In a good way.

10:30.086 --> 10:30.711
See, buddy?

10:30.711 --> 10:32.880
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.717
You're just... special.

10:37.301 --> 10:42.680
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.849
Devilish laughter aah!

10:51.147 --> 10:53.899
(Pop goes the weasel playing

10:56.235 --> 10:58.737
Laughter ah!

10:58.737 --> 11:00.238
Sighs

11:04.826 --> 11:07.620
(Pop goes the weasel playing

11:16.211 --> 11:18.338
Laughter

11:20.173 --> 11:20.674
Hey, foom foom...

11:20.674 --> 11:22.926
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

11:22.926 --> 11:25.261
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

11:25.261 --> 11:27.388
No problem. I appreciate it.

11:27.388 --> 11:28.097
Buddy is killing me.

11:28.097 --> 11:31.684
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

11:31.684 --> 11:32.851
That was quick thinking yesterday

11:32.851 --> 11:34.770
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.

11:34.770 --> 11:36.104
Ming Ming: I feel bad for the guy.

11:36.104 --> 11:37.314
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

11:37.314 --> 11:40.901
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

11:40.901 --> 11:43.278
I don't think he ever will.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.242
Foom foom: If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

11:49.242 --> 11:52.286
By now, I don't think he ever will.

11:53.287 --> 11:56.206
I think they're too small.

11:57.833 --> 12:02.128
Ming Ming: You're just... special.

12:04.631 --> 12:06.883
Snores

12:07.967 --> 12:10.302
Buddy sings deeply

12:10.302 --> 12:11.887
Sneakers screech

12:11.887 --> 12:14.431
Devilish laughter

12:19.728 --> 12:21.896
You don't look so good, buddy.

12:21.896 --> 12:22.439
Are you okay?

12:22.439 --> 12:25.942
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

12:25.942 --> 12:28.152
Aah!

12:28.694 --> 12:31.155
Buddy...

12:32.239 --> 12:34.450
Unh! Aah!

12:50.297 --> 12:51.674
Knock on door

12:51.674 --> 12:54.718
Buddy, are you okay?

12:54.718 --> 12:55.761
I'm sorry, papa.

12:55.761 --> 12:58.180
I just need some alone time.

12:58.180 --> 13:00.765
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

13:00.765 --> 13:04.018
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

13:04.018 --> 13:07.021
I... I probably should tell you.

13:07.021 --> 13:10.483
You probably should have found
out a long...

13:10.483 --> 13:11.692
A long time ago.

13:11.692 --> 13:14.737
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

13:14.737 --> 13:17.364
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

13:17.364 --> 13:20.575
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

13:20.575 --> 13:21.743
And how buddy was born

13:21.743 --> 13:24.245
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

13:24.245 --> 13:27.206
And how she had later passed away.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.249
I... I told him his father

13:28.249 --> 13:30.751
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

13:30.751 --> 13:31.544
And most importantly,

13:31.544 --> 13:33.462
I told him where his father was...

13:33.462 --> 13:37.549
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

13:37.549 --> 13:39.468
My dad works there?

13:39.468 --> 13:42.262
Empire state building.

13:46.474 --> 13:48.851
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

13:48.851 --> 13:51.729
Not now, arctic puffin.

13:52.980 --> 13:56.858
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

13:56.858 --> 13:57.985
Why the long face, partner?

13:57.985 --> 14:01.279
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

14:01.279 --> 14:02.947
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

14:02.947 --> 14:05.950
And had a beard since you were 15.

14:05.950 --> 14:07.076
Papa says my real father

14:07.076 --> 14:10.246
Lives in a magical place far away.

14:10.246 --> 14:11.539
I don't know what to do.

14:11.539 --> 14:12.331
At least you have a daddy.

14:12.331 --> 14:16.543
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

14:16.543 --> 14:19.254
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

14:19.254 --> 14:21.798
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times

14:21.798 --> 14:24.008
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

14:24.008 --> 14:27.845
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

14:27.845 --> 14:28.387
Except dogs.

14:28.387 --> 14:31.265
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

14:31.265 --> 14:31.891
Oh, I know that.

14:31.891 --> 14:35.978
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

14:35.978 --> 14:38.772
To find out whom you really are.

14:41.650 --> 14:43.943
So, I hear you're going

14:43.943 --> 14:46.863
On a little journey to
the big city.

14:46.863 --> 14:48.072
Yup. Ahh.

14:48.072 --> 14:49.323
I'm kind a nervous.

14:49.323 --> 14:49.949
Chuckles

14:49.949 --> 14:51.909
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

14:51.909 --> 14:52.993
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.955
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

14:56.955 --> 14:59.583
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.001
Really? Mm-hmm.

15:01.001 --> 15:01.584
What's it like?

15:01.584 --> 15:04.420
Well, there are some things you
should know.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.881
First off, you see gum on
The street,

15:06.881 --> 15:09.592
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

15:09.592 --> 15:10.843
Oh. Second,

15:10.843 --> 15:14.096
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

15:14.096 --> 15:15.931
They all claim to be the
Original,

15:15.931 --> 15:17.599
But the real one' son 11th.

15:17.599 --> 15:20.936
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

15:20.936 --> 15:22.812
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

15:22.812 --> 15:26.065
Look at presents before Christmas.

15:26.065 --> 15:26.899
Can't wait to see my dad...

15:26.899 --> 15:30.403
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

15:30.403 --> 15:31.987
Yeah, that's the other thing

15:31.987 --> 15:34.990
I wanted to talk to you about.

15:34.990 --> 15:38.869
You know, buddy... sighs

15:38.869 --> 15:40.996
Your father...

15:40.996 --> 15:44.415
Well... he's on the naughty list.

15:44.415 --> 15:47.877
No!!!

15:48.836 --> 15:53.007
You're taking the books back?

15:53.007 --> 15:54.008
Chuckles

15:54.008 --> 15:56.343
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

15:56.343 --> 15:58.095
Y-you're trying to make me feel bad,

15:58.095 --> 16:00.013
When, in actuality, you're the one

16:00.013 --> 16:01.097
That missed the payments.

16:01.097 --> 16:05.018
But the children love the books.

16:05.018 --> 16:05.893
I know that, uh...

16:05.893 --> 16:08.145
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

16:08.145 --> 16:09.647
But I like hearing that.

16:09.647 --> 16:13.025
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

16:13.025 --> 16:14.860
Of what's important in life.

16:14.860 --> 16:20.657
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

16:20.657 --> 16:21.533
Maybe all they need

16:21.533 --> 16:24.160
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

16:24.160 --> 16:27.121
Cheering

16:27.121 --> 16:29.665
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

16:29.665 --> 16:32.168
I know you are.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.930
And I'll...

16:45.930 --> 16:46.639
I'll always, uh,

16:46.639 --> 16:49.684
I'll always be here for you.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.941
Now, uh...

16:57.941 --> 17:00.986
Go... uh, get.

17:11.954 --> 17:12.704
Bye, guys.

17:12.704 --> 17:15.999
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

17:29.470 --> 17:32.264
Oh! Ohh!

17:35.017 --> 17:38.186
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

17:38.186 --> 17:40.146

18:35.531 --> 18:38.241

18:41.494 --> 18:42.787

18:45.290 --> 18:47.291
Does someone need a hug?

18:47.291 --> 18:49.335
Raccoon chirping

18:51.212 --> 18:54.048

Looks like a Christmas tree.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.865
A reprint?

22:23.865 --> 22:25.742
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

22:25.742 --> 22:26.951
Two whole pages are missing.

22:26.951 --> 22:28.202
The story doesn't make any sense.

22:28.202 --> 22:29.954
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

22:29.954 --> 22:32.706
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

22:42.924 --> 22:44.384
Declared kittens before.

22:46.928 --> 22:48.846

Have time.

Oh, all right, just bring'em by
The camper this week,

22:50.931 --> 22:53.767

Not gonna charge you.

23:11.909 --> 23:13.786
So, you really think we should
Ship'em?

23:13.786 --> 23:17.331
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

23:17.331 --> 23:19.332
So some kid can understand
What happened?

23:19.332 --> 23:21.001
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

23:21.001 --> 23:24.295

the North Pole.

23:45.898 --> 23:46.441
Chuckle

23:46.441 --> 23:48.568
That's exactly where I came from.

23:48.568 --> 23:50.778
Santa must've called you!

23:50.778 --> 23:51.904
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

Song or something,

A song? Uh...

24:04.499 --> 24:09.295
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

24:09.295 --> 24:15.300

Him a song

24:19.930 --> 24:21.473

28:57.100 --> 28:59.269
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

28:59.269 --> 28:59.811
Go away.

28:59.811 --> 29:01.604
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

29:01.604 --> 29:03.273
Is singing loud for all to hear.

29:03.273 --> 29:04.399
Thanks, but I don't sing.

29:04.399 --> 29:06.859
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

29:06.859 --> 29:07.819
Except louder and longer

29:07.819 --> 29:09.070
And you move your voice up
And down.

29:09.070 --> 29:11.822
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

29:11.822 --> 29:14.825
Especially in front of other
people.

29:14.825 --> 29:16.159
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

29:16.159 --> 29:17.786
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

29:17.786 --> 29:20.330
Actually, there's a big difference.

29:20.330 --> 29:22.290
No, there... no, there isn't.

29:22.290 --> 29:23.750
Wait.

29:24.751 --> 29:25.585
I'm singing

29:25.585 --> 29:29.130
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

29:29.130 --> 29:32.299
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

29:32.299 --> 29:35.719
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.

29:35.719 --> 29:36.762
Yes, there is.

29:36.762 --> 29:38.346
No, there's not.

29:38.346 --> 29:40.765
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

29:40.765 --> 29:43.393
Especially when we make toys.

29:43.393 --> 29:44.143
See?

29:44.143 --> 29:46.854
Manager over p. A: Attention,

Well, it's time for me to go home.

29:54.611 --> 29:58.281

There's so much to do.

29:58.281 --> 30:01.618

31:24.194 --> 31:25.737
No. Why not?

31:25.737 --> 31:26.779
Dad's eating in his room.

31:26.779 --> 31:29.282
Imitating father I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,

31:29.282 --> 31:31.534
And I'm way behind on a bunch

Baby, it's bad out there

32:43.808 --> 32:46.102

32:46.102 --> 32:48.813

Find out

If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

40:56.843 --> 40:59.054

other patients.

Sit still?

41:12.191 --> 41:13.651

41:15.611 --> 41:16.695
Would you please it still?
Please.

41:16.695 --> 41:18.822
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

41:18.822 --> 41:21.116
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

41:21.116 --> 41:21.866
Get this mess over with.

41:21.866 --> 41:23.576
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

41:23.576 --> 41:24.786
You betcha... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

41:24.786 --> 41:27.705
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

41:27.705 --> 41:30.124
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

41:30.833 --> 41:34.169
Ow!!! Ohh...

41:34.169 --> 41:36.296
My finger has a heartbeat.

41:36.296 --> 41:39.090
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

41:39.090 --> 41:40.884
What's your name?

41:40.884 --> 41:42.594
Buddy.

41:42.594 --> 41:44.178
I'm Carolyn.

41:44.178 --> 41:45.638
Hi.

41:46.097 --> 41:47.807
What do you want for Christmas?

41:47.807 --> 41:48.891
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

41:48.891 --> 41:51.644
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

41:51.644 --> 41:53.604
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

41:53.604 --> 41:56.898
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

41:56.898 --> 41:58.817
Well, technically, I'm a human,

41:58.817 --> 42:00.318
But I was raised by elves.

42:00.318 --> 42:03.696
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

42:03.696 --> 42:06.324
Hmm. Cool.

42:11.162 --> 42:13.664
Door opens so?

42:15.249 --> 42:18.460
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

42:18.460 --> 42:20.128
That's very impossible.

42:20.128 --> 42:21.379
You... you saw that guy out there.

42:21.379 --> 42:23.339
He's... he's certifiably insane.

42:23.339 --> 42:24.716
He's probably just reverting

42:24.716 --> 42:27.301
To a state of childlike
dependency.

42:27.301 --> 42:28.302
An elf?

42:28.302 --> 42:30.346
What he needs is to be nurtured.

42:30.346 --> 42:32.348
Oh, I see.

42:32.348 --> 42:34.349
So, um, uh...

42:34.349 --> 42:36.310
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

42:36.310 --> 42:37.728
Walter, just bring him home.

42:37.728 --> 42:38.895
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

42:38.895 --> 42:41.147
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

42:41.147 --> 42:44.275
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

42:44.275 --> 42:46.778
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

42:46.778 --> 42:50.364
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

42:50.364 --> 42:51.699
This is wonderful,

42:51.699 --> 42:54.451
You... you have another son.

42:54.451 --> 42:55.410
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

42:55.410 --> 42:58.205
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

42:58.205 --> 42:59.664
This is incredible, I...

42:59.664 --> 43:01.875
You know, it's a little
complicated,

43:01.875 --> 43:04.168
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

43:04.168 --> 43:06.671
Honey? What?

43:06.671 --> 43:09.674
He thinks he's an elf.

43:09.674 --> 43:10.800
I'm sorry, what?

43:10.800 --> 43:13.469
He thinks she's a Christmas elf.

43:13.469 --> 43:14.219
Oh, come on, Walter,

43:14.219 --> 43:18.390
I’m sure he doesn’t actually
think he’s an elf.

43:18.515 --> 43:21.810
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

43:21.810 --> 43:23.353
Of the candy cane forest,

43:23.353 --> 43:27.523
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

43:27.523 --> 43:33.195
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

43:50.711 --> 43:52.421
Ahh.

43:53.839 --> 43:57.551
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

43:57.551 --> 43:58.468
The north pole.

43:58.468 --> 44:00.220
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

44:00.220 --> 44:03.848
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

44:03.848 --> 44:08.894
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

44:08.894 --> 44:10.312
Yes.

44:11.230 --> 44:13.232
You like sugar, huh?

44:13.232 --> 44:14.817
Is there sugar in syrup?

44:14.817 --> 44:15.984
Yes.

44:15.984 --> 44:17.277
Then yes.

44:17.277 --> 44:19.779
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

44:19.779 --> 44:25.868
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

44:25.868 --> 44:29.538
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

44:29.538 --> 44:30.748
You mean I can stay?

44:30.748 --> 44:32.291
Of course you can. Emily.

44:32.291 --> 44:34.793
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

44:34.793 --> 44:36.420
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

44:36.420 --> 44:39.756
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

44:39.756 --> 44:42.509
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

44:42.509 --> 44:45.303
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

44:47.930 --> 44:49.598
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

44:49.598 --> 44:52.268
Clearly he has some serious issues.

44:52.268 --> 44:54.520
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.355
Why not? He loves the snow.

44:56.355 --> 44:57.856
He's told me 15 times.

44:57.856 --> 45:00.442
Walter, he's your son.

45:01.359 --> 45:03.778
Belching

45:14.329 --> 45:15.998
Did you hear that?

45:17.332 --> 45:20.001
You are so weird.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.338
Dad?

45:26.340 --> 45:28.092
Dad?

45:28.968 --> 45:31.345
Dad! Door opens

45:32.054 --> 45:33.180
What?

45:33.180 --> 45:34.973
Whispering I can't go to sleep

45:34.973 --> 45:37.142
Unless I get tucked in.

45:37.142 --> 45:38.393
What?

45:38.393 --> 45:42.355
I can't go to sleep unless I
get tucked in.

45:42.647 --> 45:44.566
I am not gonna tuck you in.

45:44.566 --> 45:47.985
I... I promise I’ll go right
to sleep.

45:50.154 --> 45:51.614
Fine.

45:59.079 --> 46:00.997
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.

46:00.997 --> 46:03.416
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

46:03.416 --> 46:05.001
Sorry.

46:05.835 --> 46:07.044
It's all right.

46:07.044 --> 46:07.962
Hey, uh...

46:07.962 --> 46:08.588
Clears throat

46:08.588 --> 46:11.048
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

46:11.048 --> 46:12.091
Okay.

46:12.091 --> 46:13.634
Okay.

46:14.510 --> 46:18.346
Dad? Hmm?

46:18.346 --> 46:20.348
I love you.

46:22.892 --> 46:26.437
Okay. Go to sleep now.

46:30.900 --> 46:32.192
Well, this is really something.

46:32.192 --> 46:36.530
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

46:37.531 --> 46:40.533
That's good, that's good.

46:41.910 --> 46:43.536
Okay.

46:50.668 --> 46:52.378
Oh, that's good.

46:52.378 --> 46:54.129
Good? Good.

46:54.129 --> 46:55.464
Good.

46:55.464 --> 46:58.425
So, did you, um...

46:58.425 --> 47:00.135
Did you sleep okay last night?

47:00.135 --> 47:01.636
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

47:01.636 --> 47:04.931
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

47:05.056 --> 47:09.143
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

47:09.143 --> 47:11.937
Where did you get all the wood?

47:21.654 --> 47:23.990
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

47:23.990 --> 47:27.451
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

47:27.451 --> 47:29.412
Isn’t that nice? Grunts

47:29.412 --> 47:30.913
And lunch.

47:30.913 --> 47:32.998
And lunch.

47:32.998 --> 47:34.041
Emily: Bye.

47:34.041 --> 47:35.000
So, dad, how many scoops?

47:35.000 --> 47:37.961
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

47:40.171 --> 47:41.047
So, dad...

47:41.047 --> 47:42.757
I planned out our whole day.

47:42.757 --> 47:43.967
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

47:43.967 --> 47:46.594
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

47:46.594 --> 47:48.679
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

47:48.679 --> 47:51.015
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

47:51.015 --> 47:53.684
I've got to go to work, buddy.

47:53.684 --> 47:54.935
Oh, and another thing...

47:54.935 --> 47:56.603
If you're going to be staying
here,

47:56.603 --> 47:58.522
You should think about, you know,

47:58.522 --> 48:00.232
Getting rid of the costume.

48:00.232 --> 48:01.608
But I've worn this my whole life.

48:01.608 --> 48:04.736
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

48:04.736 --> 48:07.029
You wanna make me happy, don’t you?

48:07.029 --> 48:07.697
More than anything.

48:07.697 --> 48:12.534
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

48:12.534 --> 48:13.786
As soon as possible?

48:13.786 --> 48:15.746
As soon as possible.

48:15.746 --> 48:17.164
Okay.

48:18.957 --> 48:20.166
Emily: I almost forgot...

48:20.166 --> 48:22.043
Aah! Aah!

48:25.004 --> 48:26.672
Good morning.

48:27.256 --> 48:29.550
Cell phone rings

48:29.550 --> 48:31.177
Ring

48:31.177 --> 48:31.760
Walter here.

48:31.760 --> 48:34.054
Gasps it worked, it's you.

48:34.054 --> 48:35.514
How'd you get this number?

48:35.514 --> 48:38.058
Emily left an emergency list.

48:38.058 --> 48:38.683
I see.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.310
And, uh, is this an emergency?

48:40.310 --> 48:41.519
There's a horrible noise

48:41.519 --> 48:44.522
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

48:44.522 --> 48:45.815
It sounds like this...

48:45.815 --> 48:49.485
Screeches and wails

48:49.485 --> 48:52.321
It’s, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

48:52.321 --> 48:53.489
It’s, uh, it's a radiator,

48:53.489 --> 48:55.324
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

48:55.324 --> 48:58.118
No, it doesn't. It... It’s very
evil.

48:58.118 --> 49:01.705
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

49:01.705 --> 49:05.792
I’m going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

49:05.792 --> 49:07.502
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

49:07.502 --> 49:08.628
Everything's fine.

49:08.628 --> 49:09.295
You were right.

49:09.295 --> 49:11.797
Okay, good, uh, I’m gonna hang
up now.

49:11.797 --> 49:12.673
I love you.

49:12.673 --> 49:14.258
I'll call you in five minutes.

49:14.258 --> 49:16.051
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

49:16.051 --> 49:18.595
You... you don’t have to call me
, okay?

49:18.595 --> 49:20.180
Good idea, you call me.

49:20.180 --> 49:22.015
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

49:22.015 --> 49:23.850
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

49:23.850 --> 49:26.144
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

49:26.144 --> 49:28.020
I tuned the piano.

49:28.020 --> 49:30.606
Okay, I love you. Bye.

49:30.606 --> 49:32.608
Mmm...

49:32.608 --> 49:34.193
Mmm... Mmm.

49:48.706 --> 49:50.749
Mmm.

49:50.749 --> 49:51.709
Sighs

49:51.709 --> 49:54.545
Hobbs. Hey!

49:54.795 --> 49:56.296
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

49:56.296 --> 49:58.590
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

49:58.590 --> 49:59.549
You're looking good.

49:59.549 --> 50:01.134
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

50:01.134 --> 50:02.385
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

50:02.385 --> 50:05.763
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

50:06.806 --> 50:07.640
She wants to know

50:07.640 --> 50:10.393
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

50:10.393 --> 50:15.105
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

50:16.607 --> 50:17.232
Believe me, uh,

50:17.232 --> 50:18.775
We’re already looking for new
printers.

50:18.775 --> 50:20.360
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

50:20.360 --> 50:23.863
Maybe it isn’t the printer who’s
gotten sloppy.

50:23.863 --> 50:26.115
That's your signature, right?

50:26.115 --> 50:29.118
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

50:29.118 --> 50:30.661
I've got news for you...

50:30.661 --> 50:33.163
Even if those two pages were
in there,

50:33.163 --> 50:34.665
The book still would have sucked.

50:34.665 --> 50:36.375
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

50:36.375 --> 50:39.211
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

50:39.211 --> 50:41.129
That frigging puppy and pigeon

50:41.129 --> 50:42.380
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

50:42.380 --> 50:44.340
My people estimate we’re
gonna post

50:44.340 --> 50:46.175
A minus eight for this quarter.

50:46.175 --> 50:49.387
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

50:49.387 --> 50:51.847
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

50:51.847 --> 50:53.307
No, no, no. No? Well...

50:53.307 --> 50:55.392
We’re gonna ship a new book

50:55.392 --> 50:56.643
The first quarter.

50:56.643 --> 50:58.186
First quarter?

50:58.186 --> 51:00.647
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

51:00.647 --> 51:03.399
At that time, I would love
to hear

51:03.399 --> 51:05.193
In exact detail

51:05.193 --> 51:08.404
What your plans are for this
new book.

51:08.613 --> 51:12.324
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.

51:14.159 --> 51:15.160
And?

51:15.160 --> 51:17.120
And, uh...

51:17.120 --> 51:20.165
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

51:20.165 --> 51:23.126
School bell rings

51:23.251 --> 51:26.295
Michael: All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

51:26.295 --> 51:28.798
I got full health, I got full
armor.

51:28.798 --> 51:29.674
Michael!

51:29.674 --> 51:30.800
I got full...

51:30.800 --> 51:31.967
Michael!

51:31.967 --> 51:33.927
It's me buddy!

51:34.720 --> 51:35.429
You know that guy?

51:35.429 --> 51:37.931
No, I’ve never seen him before.

51:37.931 --> 51:41.393
It's me buddy! Your brother!

51:41.393 --> 51:42.769
Oh, man.

51:42.769 --> 51:47.398
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

51:47.398 --> 51:48.316
Tires screech

51:48.316 --> 51:50.943
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

51:51.652 --> 51:54.321
Michael! Michael!

51:54.321 --> 51:56.156
Michael!

51:56.156 --> 51:57.783
Michael, wait up!

51:57.783 --> 52:00.827
Michael! Michael!

52:00.827 --> 52:01.661
Wow, you're fast.

52:01.661 --> 52:03.329
I'm glad I caught up with you.

52:03.329 --> 52:05.373
I waited five hours for you.

52:05.373 --> 52:06.707
Why is your coat so big?

52:06.707 --> 52:09.168
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

52:09.168 --> 52:11.670
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

52:11.670 --> 52:13.422
How was school? Was it fun?

52:13.422 --> 52:15.299
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

52:15.299 --> 52:16.466
Do you have any friends?

52:16.466 --> 52:17.801
Do you have a best friend?

52:17.801 --> 52:19.511
Does he have a big coat, too?

52:19.511 --> 52:20.971
Go away!

52:22.347 --> 52:26.476
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

52:29.312 --> 52:30.729
Run!

52:31.230 --> 52:34.691
Boy: Get him! Get the
green guy!

52:34.691 --> 52:37.194
Boys cheering

52:41.698 --> 52:44.450
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

52:44.450 --> 52:47.036
We better get outta here.

52:48.329 --> 52:50.873
You know what? We can take'em.

52:50.873 --> 52:54.877
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

53:01.966 --> 53:04.385
Grunts you ready?

53:05.303 --> 53:08.097
Let's go. Aah! Ow.

53:09.307 --> 53:10.724
Ow!

53:15.562 --> 53:17.439
Boy: Run!

53:23.486 --> 53:25.071
Crying

53:25.446 --> 53:28.241
Michael: Oh, man. One got away.

53:28.241 --> 53:29.533
Snowball.

53:37.916 --> 53:39.543
Kid: Unh!

53:40.335 --> 53:41.795
Wow.

53:42.420 --> 53:45.256
Where did you say you were from?

53:46.257 --> 53:47.508
Oh, yeah

53:47.508 --> 53:50.261
Candles burning low

53:50.261 --> 53:52.930
Lots of mistletoe

53:52.930 --> 53:58.769
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

53:58.769 --> 54:04.315
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

54:04.315 --> 54:06.567
All these things and more

54:06.567 --> 54:08.277
I wish dad were here.

54:08.277 --> 54:08.569
Why?

54:08.569 --> 54:12.531
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

54:12.531 --> 54:13.365
Are you kidding?

54:13.365 --> 54:15.951
He's the worst dad in the world.

54:15.951 --> 54:17.285
What do you mean?

54:17.285 --> 54:19.538
All he does is work.

54:19.538 --> 54:20.956
Working's fun.

54:20.956 --> 54:22.999
Not the way he does it.

54:22.999 --> 54:24.042
All he cares about is money.

54:24.042 --> 54:28.129
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

54:28.129 --> 54:30.965
Well, he is on the naughty list.

54:35.594 --> 54:37.346
You like her?

54:37.346 --> 54:39.306
Like who?

54:39.472 --> 54:41.349
The girl you’re staring at.

54:41.349 --> 54:43.017
Oh, uh...

54:43.017 --> 54:44.852
Yeah.

54:46.145 --> 54:48.314
Why don’t you ask her out?

54:48.314 --> 54:49.315
Out?

54:49.315 --> 54:52.401
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

54:52.401 --> 54:53.319
Food?

54:53.319 --> 54:56.071
Yes, real food, not candy.

54:56.071 --> 54:58.115
And if she says yes,
you're in.

54:58.115 --> 55:01.368
It's like a secret code
girls have.

55:02.994 --> 55:04.996
Well, look who it is.

55:04.996 --> 55:08.124
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

55:10.084 --> 55:11.877
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

55:11.877 --> 55:13.504
I'm his brother.

55:14.463 --> 55:15.506
Hi.

55:15.506 --> 55:17.341
So, what are you doing here?

55:17.341 --> 55:19.634
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

55:19.634 --> 55:22.512
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

55:22.512 --> 55:24.555
They gave me a restraining
order.

55:24.681 --> 55:28.643
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

55:28.643 --> 55:31.604
Ho ho ho!

55:31.604 --> 55:33.856
But... I really wanted to
see you,

55:33.856 --> 55:37.943
And... and I think you’re
beautiful, and I, um...

55:37.943 --> 55:41.404
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

55:41.404 --> 55:45.700
And, um, my tongue swells up.

55:49.662 --> 55:51.914
So...

55:52.206 --> 55:54.416
Do you wanna go eat food?

55:55.083 --> 55:57.377
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

55:57.377 --> 55:58.378
Mm-hmm.

55:58.378 --> 56:03.675
You know, uh, the code... food.

56:05.426 --> 56:08.554
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

56:08.929 --> 56:11.599
Oh, okay. I understand.

56:11.599 --> 56:14.560
But I’m free on Thursday.

56:15.561 --> 56:17.020
Thursday! Thursday!

56:17.020 --> 56:19.189
Come on. That'd be great.

56:19.189 --> 56:20.190
All right.

56:20.190 --> 56:21.983
Buddy: Was that okay?

56:21.983 --> 56:24.611
You did great, man.

56:25.111 --> 56:26.487
What should we put on it
first?

56:26.487 --> 56:28.155
Lights! Oh, good.

56:28.155 --> 56:29.198
And then, after that?

56:29.198 --> 56:32.076
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

56:32.993 --> 56:34.578
What the hell's that?

56:34.578 --> 56:36.413
Michael: A Christmas tree.

56:36.413 --> 56:37.122
A Christmas tree?

56:37.122 --> 56:40.250
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

56:41.001 --> 56:42.502
Emily.

56:42.502 --> 56:45.088
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

56:45.088 --> 56:47.548
They were just having a
little fun.

56:47.548 --> 56:49.133
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

56:49.133 --> 56:51.927
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

56:51.927 --> 56:52.928
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

56:52.928 --> 56:54.221
I'll get him to plant
another one.

56:54.221 --> 56:56.974
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

56:56.974 --> 56:59.434
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

56:59.434 --> 57:01.561
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

57:01.561 --> 57:04.022
That you haven’t exactly been
there for him.

57:04.022 --> 57:05.648
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

57:05.648 --> 57:07.942
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

57:07.942 --> 57:09.276
Deranged elf man raise him?

57:09.276 --> 57:12.112
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

57:12.112 --> 57:15.199
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

57:15.199 --> 57:16.742
I got it.

57:28.669 --> 57:29.795
I mean, what are we gonna do?

57:29.795 --> 57:31.964
We can't... we can’t leave him
alone here.

57:31.964 --> 57:34.466
He's gonna destroy the place.

57:36.510 --> 57:37.260
Why don’t you, um...

57:37.260 --> 57:38.595
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

57:38.595 --> 57:40.805
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

57:40.805 --> 57:43.141
Oh, no. No, I can’t stay home
tomorrow,

57:43.141 --> 57:44.642
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

57:44.642 --> 57:45.810
Well, honey, I can’t take off,

57:45.810 --> 57:48.271
I’m one... one bad pitch away

57:48.271 --> 57:49.313
From getting fired... one.

57:49.313 --> 57:51.232
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

57:51.232 --> 57:55.152
Why don’t you take buddy to
work with you?

57:58.071 --> 57:59.865
Elevator chimes

58:02.492 --> 58:04.661
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.

58:04.661 --> 58:06.329
Morning, jack.

58:06.954 --> 58:07.914
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

58:07.914 --> 58:09.498
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

58:09.498 --> 58:12.543
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

58:12.543 --> 58:14.044
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

58:14.044 --> 58:18.131
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

58:18.131 --> 58:19.382
Gasps

58:19.382 --> 58:20.592
Hi! Hi.

58:20.592 --> 58:21.551
Do you remember me?

58:21.551 --> 58:22.677
I do. I didn't recognize you.

58:22.677 --> 58:25.388
I know, I’m in work clothes.

58:28.891 --> 58:30.893
Thank you, Deborah.

58:30.893 --> 58:31.936
Thanks, deb.

58:31.936 --> 58:33.145
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

58:33.145 --> 58:34.688
You should be on a Christmas card.

58:34.688 --> 58:37.149
You just made my day.

58:44.989 --> 58:46.449
Eww.

58:49.201 --> 58:50.411
Buddy. Hmm?

58:50.411 --> 58:52.413
You don’t have to drink that.

58:52.413 --> 58:53.914
Thank you.

59:04.048 --> 59:06.050
Francisco.

59:07.176 --> 59:09.720
Francisco.

59:11.013 --> 59:13.432
Francisco.

59:13.432 --> 59:14.600
Francisco.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.059
Buddy?

59:16.643 --> 59:18.395
Am I too loud?

59:18.395 --> 59:19.729
Just... just a little.

59:19.729 --> 59:21.439
Sorry.

59:27.403 --> 59:28.029
Yes, bud?

59:28.029 --> 59:30.698
Why is your name on the desk?

59:30.698 --> 59:32.908
I bought the desk.

59:32.908 --> 59:35.702
My name's there so no one
steals it.

59:37.537 --> 59:38.997
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

59:38.997 --> 59:41.166
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

59:41.166 --> 59:44.585
So, what are we gonna build?

59:44.585 --> 59:45.962
No, uh, we don't do

59:45.962 --> 59:47.672
That kind of work here, pal.

59:47.672 --> 59:48.923
Phone rings

59:48.923 --> 59:51.175
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

59:51.175 --> 59:52.593
Put that down. Hello?

59:52.593 --> 59:54.970
Hello? Dial tone

59:56.221 --> 59:58.723
Please, don’t touch anything.

59:58.723 --> 01:00:00.183
Sorry.

01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:05.021
Hey...

01:00:06.773 --> 01:00:09.025
Bud, have you... have you...

01:00:09.025 --> 01:00:10.985
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

01:00:10.985 --> 01:00:12.194
A mailroom? No.

01:00:12.194 --> 01:00:13.445
No? No.

01:00:13.445 --> 01:00:14.279
Oh, I mean, wow.

01:00:14.279 --> 01:00:17.032
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

01:00:17.032 --> 01:00:18.033
From all over the world
comes,

01:00:18.033 --> 01:00:20.744
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

01:00:20.744 --> 01:00:21.745
And you can touch it all,

01:00:21.745 --> 01:00:23.580
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.123
Shiny bins? Right.

01:00:25.123 --> 01:00:27.625
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:28.668
Good.

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:30.211
Can we go there?

01:00:30.211 --> 01:00:31.003
Well, um...

01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:34.214
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:35.507
Okay, I’ll work there.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:38.051
Rap music playing

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.220
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.513
My dad was talking about.

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:43.056
Is there a different mailroom?

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.266
No. This is the only one.

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:47.518
It's not very shiny.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:51.647
Now... over here’s the trench.

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.774
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

01:00:53.774 --> 01:00:58.195
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

01:00:58.195 --> 01:00:59.196
Put it in a canister

01:00:59.196 --> 01:01:02.782
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

01:01:02.782 --> 01:01:04.659
You got that?

01:01:04.659 --> 01:01:05.660
I think so.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.621
This place reminds me of
Santa’s workshop.

01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:10.206
Except it smells like mushrooms,

01:01:10.206 --> 01:01:13.208
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.502
Uh, greenway’s coming in tomorrow,

01:01:15.502 --> 01:01:17.129
So, what... what do we got?

01:01:17.129 --> 01:01:19.172
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

01:01:19.172 --> 01:01:21.633
And we've come up with what I
think

01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:23.092
Is a pretty big idea.

01:01:23.092 --> 01:01:23.593
Great, what?

01:01:23.593 --> 01:01:26.137
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

01:01:26.137 --> 01:01:27.138
What?

01:01:27.138 --> 01:01:29.849
Okay, picture this...

01:01:29.849 --> 01:01:33.727
We bring in miles finch.

01:01:34.645 --> 01:01:36.563
The miles finch?

01:01:36.563 --> 01:01:37.814
The golden ghost.

01:01:37.814 --> 01:01:38.690
We bring him in!

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.568
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

01:01:41.568 --> 01:01:42.569
It ain't gonna be easy,

01:01:42.569 --> 01:01:44.237
But I think it’s worth a shot.

01:01:44.237 --> 01:01:48.866
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

01:01:48.866 --> 01:01:50.576
You came in here pitching me

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:53.120
The idea of hiring another writer?

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.204
Yeah.

01:01:54.204 --> 01:01:56.373
Miles finch.

01:01:59.084 --> 01:02:01.586
I like it. Chuckles

01:02:02.754 --> 01:02:03.755
I like it.

01:02:03.755 --> 01:02:05.798
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

01:02:05.798 --> 01:02:06.799
Of the candy cane forest

01:02:06.799 --> 01:02:11.095
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:13.597
Gasps ooh!

01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:16.642
Wow... it's sucky.

01:02:16.642 --> 01:02:19.561
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:21.563
That is marvelous how that...

01:02:21.563 --> 01:02:23.356
Oh! (Laughs

01:02:23.356 --> 01:02:25.692
Oh, it's very sucky.

01:02:25.692 --> 01:02:28.402
It's very... sucky.

01:02:28.402 --> 01:02:29.737
Whoo.

01:02:29.737 --> 01:02:31.614
So, how'd you get here?

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.073
Work release.

01:02:33.073 --> 01:02:34.199
Mm.

01:02:34.199 --> 01:02:36.785
Oh, syrup and coffee?

01:02:36.785 --> 01:02:40.080
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.247
Be my guest.

01:02:41.247 --> 01:02:42.749
Very generous of you.

01:02:42.749 --> 01:02:47.128
Mmm. Gasps I love syrup.

01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:51.340
Ohh, I love it.

01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:54.593
Mmm...

01:02:54.593 --> 01:02:57.387
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

01:02:57.387 --> 01:02:58.388
But we are buddies.

01:02:58.388 --> 01:03:00.640
You're my best friend, that's it.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.391
You're my best friend.

01:03:01.391 --> 01:03:04.102
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

01:03:04.102 --> 01:03:06.270
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:08.314
I know, I’m right, I listen to you.

01:03:08.314 --> 01:03:09.273
You have great ideas.

01:03:09.273 --> 01:03:11.150
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:12.359
Good, you go with the flow.

01:03:12.359 --> 01:03:13.444
Yeah. Go with the flow.

01:03:13.444 --> 01:03:15.237
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

01:03:15.237 --> 01:03:16.196
Well, then get out of the flow.

01:03:16.196 --> 01:03:17.406
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

01:03:17.406 --> 01:03:20.825
I gotta... I’m 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

01:03:20.825 --> 01:03:22.827
You're young. You're so young.

01:03:22.827 --> 01:03:23.828
Sighs

01:03:23.828 --> 01:03:24.662
My papa... yeah?

01:03:24.662 --> 01:03:29.291
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490, so...

01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:31.669
Laughing

01:03:32.169 --> 01:03:33.879
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:35.380
Laughing

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.632
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

01:03:37.632 --> 01:03:40.385
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

01:03:40.385 --> 01:03:43.888
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

01:03:43.888 --> 01:03:47.725
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

01:03:47.725 --> 01:03:50.311
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

01:03:50.311 --> 01:03:52.938
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

01:03:52.938 --> 01:03:54.189
On our speakerphone.

01:03:54.189 --> 01:03:56.191
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

01:03:56.191 --> 01:03:57.192
Can you fly in tomorrow?

01:03:57.192 --> 01:03:59.444
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

01:03:59.444 --> 01:04:00.695
Not a minute more.

01:04:00.695 --> 01:04:01.738
Oh, that's... that's great.

01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:05.408
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.201
I need the interior of that car

01:04:07.201 --> 01:04:09.203
To be 71 degrees exactly.

01:04:09.203 --> 01:04:11.205
We can do that. Deborah: Mr. Hobbs?

01:04:11.205 --> 01:04:12.706
There’s a situation downstairs.

01:04:12.706 --> 01:04:13.916
Finch: I'm sorry, what?

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.167
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

01:04:15.167 --> 01:04:17.336
Finch: I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

01:04:17.336 --> 01:04:19.921
Deborah: We have a problem in the
mailroom.

01:04:19.921 --> 01:04:20.839
What's going on?

01:04:20.839 --> 01:04:21.881
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

01:04:21.881 --> 01:04:24.842
Finch: That's it, I’m gone. Miles!

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.723
Finch: I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

01:04:30.723 --> 01:04:32.891
Deborah: Sir, chuck in the mailroom

01:04:32.891 --> 01:04:34.435
Needs to talk to you.

01:04:34.435 --> 01:04:35.852
Chuck... what, chuck?

01:04:35.852 --> 01:04:37.396
I mean, what could be going on
down there

01:04:37.396 --> 01:04:39.439
That’s so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

01:04:39.439 --> 01:04:41.232
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

01:04:41.232 --> 01:04:43.234
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

01:04:43.234 --> 01:04:45.194
Whoomp! There it is

01:04:45.194 --> 01:04:46.696
Upside down and inside out hey!

01:04:46.696 --> 01:04:47.989
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

01:04:47.989 --> 01:04:49.448
What it's all about hey!

01:04:49.448 --> 01:04:50.699
Time for me to get on the mike

01:04:50.699 --> 01:04:52.243
And make this mother of a party
hype

01:04:52.243 --> 01:04:53.827
I’m taking you back to the old
school

01:04:53.827 --> 01:04:55.537
'cause I’m an old fool who’s so cool

01:04:55.537 --> 01:04:57.331
If you wanna get down, I’m gonna
show you the way

01:04:57.331 --> 01:04:59.457
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear
you say

01:04:59.457 --> 01:05:01.751
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

01:05:01.751 --> 01:05:03.753
Whoomp! There it is a little louder

01:05:03.753 --> 01:05:05.755
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

01:05:05.755 --> 01:05:07.423
Whoomp, there it is!

01:05:07.423 --> 01:05:09.008
Door buzzer

01:05:09.842 --> 01:05:10.301
Coming.

01:05:10.301 --> 01:05:13.387
(You make me feel so young playing

01:05:15.931 --> 01:05:17.391
Hi.

01:05:17.391 --> 01:05:18.767
Wow.

01:05:18.767 --> 01:05:20.518
You look miraculous.

01:05:20.518 --> 01:05:22.020
So do you.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.229
Thank you.

01:05:23.229 --> 01:05:25.231
What would you like to do?

01:05:25.231 --> 01:05:27.316
I got some ideas.

01:05:31.403 --> 01:05:35.324
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

01:05:35.324 --> 01:05:38.785
Don't look. There you go.

01:05:40.954 --> 01:05:42.413
Well?

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:45.458
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:47.752
Chuckles no.

01:05:49.295 --> 01:05:51.046
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

01:05:51.046 --> 01:05:53.549
No, it's the world’s best cup
of coffee.

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:57.302
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

01:05:57.302 --> 01:06:00.805
Also, never close your eyes’ cause
then

01:06:00.805 --> 01:06:04.475
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

01:06:04.475 --> 01:06:06.269
Laughing what are you doing?

01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:10.022
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

01:06:10.022 --> 01:06:12.358
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

01:06:12.358 --> 01:06:15.068
Now, look at the size of this one.

01:06:20.573 --> 01:06:22.450
Come with me.

01:06:23.284 --> 01:06:24.410
Watch out. (Tires screech

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:25.828
Yellow ones don’t stop.

01:06:25.828 --> 01:06:28.497
The yellow ones don’t stop.

01:06:33.961 --> 01:06:38.090
Wow... that's a big one.

01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:00.360
I'm sorry.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.528
You missed.

01:07:01.528 --> 01:07:03.488
What do you mean I missed?

01:07:03.488 --> 01:07:04.989
You missed.

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:16.333
Elevator chimes

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:26.092
Miles finch.

01:07:26.092 --> 01:07:28.052
Miles finch.

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:31.889
Miles finch.

01:07:34.433 --> 01:07:35.851
All right, let's do this.

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:38.186
Miles, I’m so happy you could come
Uh...

01:07:38.186 --> 01:07:38.562
Yeah.

01:07:38.562 --> 01:07:40.981
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

01:07:40.981 --> 01:07:43.858
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

01:07:43.858 --> 01:07:45.568
Here you go.

01:07:47.153 --> 01:07:48.571
Finch: Great.

01:07:48.571 --> 01:07:51.031
All right... clears throat

01:07:51.031 --> 01:07:53.534
What have you guys got so far?

01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:55.118
Go ahead.

01:07:55.118 --> 01:07:56.161
Uh...

01:07:56.161 --> 01:07:59.414
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

01:07:59.414 --> 01:08:01.416
We open on a young tomato.

01:08:01.416 --> 01:08:03.543
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

01:08:03.543 --> 01:08:05.420
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.922
No. No tomatoes...

01:08:07.922 --> 01:08:08.547
Too vulnerable.

01:08:08.547 --> 01:08:10.424
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

01:08:10.424 --> 01:08:11.634
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

01:08:11.634 --> 01:08:13.510
I told them the very same thing...

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:14.178
And no farms.

01:08:14.178 --> 01:08:16.638
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

01:08:16.638 --> 01:08:19.057
A farm book would just be white
noise.

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:19.933
What about this?

01:08:19.933 --> 01:08:22.935
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

01:08:22.935 --> 01:08:27.564
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:34.613
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

01:08:34.613 --> 01:08:36.113
I have no time, so, you know,

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:37.115
If you've got a story here...

01:08:37.115 --> 01:08:39.951
I’ve got about five or six great
starts here.

01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:41.995
I've got one idea that
I’m especially

01:08:41.995 --> 01:08:44.205
Psyched out of my mind about.

01:08:44.205 --> 01:08:46.415
You know, it's one of those ideas

01:08:46.415 --> 01:08:47.959
Where you're just like, uh...

01:08:47.959 --> 01:08:48.917
Yes!

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:51.127
Whoa! Chuckling

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.546
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:56.925
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

01:08:56.925 --> 01:08:58.926
Dad! I'm in love, I’m in love,

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:02.430
And I don't care who knows it!

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.139
Buddy, not now, uh,

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.558
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.727
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:11.229
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:16.151
Oh... boy, you're... you’re hilarious,
my friend.

01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:18.444
He doesn't, uh... get back to

01:09:18.444 --> 01:09:21.113
The story, please. All right, okay.

01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:22.240
Clears throat

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.741
So, on the cover above the title...

01:09:23.741 --> 01:09:26.285
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

01:09:26.285 --> 01:09:28.453
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

01:09:28.453 --> 01:09:30.581
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

01:09:30.581 --> 01:09:32.457
Buddy... go back to the basement.

01:09:32.457 --> 01:09:34.001
Finch: Hey, jack weed,

01:09:34.001 --> 01:09:35.627
I get more action in a week

01:09:35.627 --> 01:09:37.004
than you've had your entire life.

01:09:37.004 --> 01:09:40.631
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:42.050
Oh. Each one of them

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:44.051
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

01:09:44.051 --> 01:09:45.553
So, I suggest you wipe

01:09:45.553 --> 01:09:46.970
That stupid smile off your face

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:49.515
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

01:09:49.515 --> 01:09:51.183
You feeling strong, my friend?!

01:09:51.183 --> 01:09:54.645
Call me elf one more time!

01:09:58.607 --> 01:10:01.484
Whispers he's an angry elf.

01:10:04.195 --> 01:10:07.073
Growling look at you.

01:10:09.033 --> 01:10:10.993
Ow! Hey, what...

01:10:10.993 --> 01:10:11.785
Aah!

01:10:11.785 --> 01:10:13.495
I wasn't ready for that.

01:10:13.495 --> 01:10:14.538
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

01:10:14.538 --> 01:10:18.041
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:18.542
Ooh...

01:10:18.542 --> 01:10:20.502
Call me elf one more time!

01:10:20.502 --> 01:10:22.003
Call me elf!

01:10:22.003 --> 01:10:24.005
You're an elf.

01:10:27.049 --> 01:10:29.010
Glass shatters

01:10:29.343 --> 01:10:33.055
Miles, I’m sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

01:10:34.014 --> 01:10:34.848
Listen, miles...

01:10:34.848 --> 01:10:36.099
Listen, miles! Door slams

01:10:36.099 --> 01:10:39.853
He must be a South Pole elf.

01:10:42.188 --> 01:10:43.273
You get the hell outta here.

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:45.566
Where do you want me to go?

01:10:45.566 --> 01:10:46.526
I don't care where you go.

01:10:46.526 --> 01:10:48.069
I don't care that you're an elf!

01:10:48.069 --> 01:10:49.070
I don't care that you’re nuts!

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:51.280
I don't care that you’re my son!

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.241
Get out of my life now!

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:05.710
Emily: Hi, it's me.

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:07.253
I really can't talk right now.

01:11:07.253 --> 01:11:09.588
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

01:11:09.588 --> 01:11:12.341
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

01:11:12.341 --> 01:11:14.593
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

01:11:14.593 --> 01:11:16.136
It’s Christmas Eve.

01:11:16.136 --> 01:11:18.096
Walter... wait, um.

01:11:18.096 --> 01:11:20.223
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

01:11:20.223 --> 01:11:22.392
Oh, say hi to buddy.

01:11:23.268 --> 01:11:24.894
What? Walter, breakthrough.

01:11:24.894 --> 01:11:27.104
We found this in the conference
room.

01:11:27.104 --> 01:11:27.605
What is it?

01:11:27.605 --> 01:11:29.565
It's miles finch’s notebook.

01:11:29.565 --> 01:11:32.735
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

01:11:32.735 --> 01:11:33.402
I mean, look at that.

01:11:33.402 --> 01:11:37.280
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.574
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

01:11:39.574 --> 01:11:40.241
What, uh, what do we do?

01:11:40.241 --> 01:11:43.578
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

01:11:43.578 --> 01:11:44.245
Uh, how much time we got?

01:11:44.245 --> 01:11:46.122
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

01:11:46.122 --> 01:11:48.124
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

01:11:48.124 --> 01:11:49.375
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

01:11:49.375 --> 01:11:51.877
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

01:11:51.877 --> 01:11:53.420
Go and get a storyboard ready.

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:55.672
Oh, boy! Go.

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.886
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

01:12:01.886 --> 01:12:06.808
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

01:12:06.808 --> 01:12:12.229
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

01:12:12.646 --> 01:12:18.193
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

01:12:18.193 --> 01:12:19.653
God...

01:12:30.788 --> 01:12:32.289
Hey, buddy.

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.376
Buddy?

01:12:42.298 --> 01:12:44.342
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

01:12:44.342 --> 01:12:45.718
To get the company back on
track.

01:12:45.718 --> 01:12:48.971
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

01:12:48.971 --> 01:12:53.434
When I say... this better be good.

01:12:53.434 --> 01:12:55.269
Before I get into the story, uh,

01:12:55.269 --> 01:12:57.270
Let me start with the cover, okay?

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:58.939
Now, just picture this...

01:12:58.939 --> 01:13:01.858
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

01:13:01.858 --> 01:13:03.443
Walter: Michael, what is it?

01:13:03.443 --> 01:13:04.694
Buddy ran away.

01:13:04.694 --> 01:13:06.821
What? He... he left a note.

01:13:06.821 --> 01:13:09.490
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:11.867
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

01:13:11.867 --> 01:13:14.411
And then, um, we’ll figure it
out, okay?

01:13:14.411 --> 01:13:18.832
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

01:13:18.832 --> 01:13:21.001
All you care about is yourself.

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:25.213
Hey, Michael.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.381
Wait.

01:13:30.676 --> 01:13:34.179
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

01:13:34.179 --> 01:13:35.681
We don't have time to reschedule.

01:13:35.681 --> 01:13:36.973
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

01:13:36.973 --> 01:13:38.183
Son, you'll have to wait.

01:13:38.183 --> 01:13:42.187
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

01:13:42.729 --> 01:13:45.732
Can’t... can’t we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

01:13:45.732 --> 01:13:48.526
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

01:13:48.526 --> 01:13:49.860
And I intend to.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.362
It's gonna have to wait.

01:13:51.362 --> 01:13:53.405
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

01:13:53.405 --> 01:13:56.366
You will pitch me this book
right now.

01:14:03.373 --> 01:14:06.375
Well... up yours.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:09.462
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.423
Hobbs... Hobbs!

01:14:12.423 --> 01:14:14.216
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:16.760
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.303
You're finished!

01:14:35.527 --> 01:14:38.530
I don't belong anywhere.

01:14:40.782 --> 01:14:42.909
Buddy!

01:14:42.909 --> 01:14:44.786
Buddy!

01:14:44.786 --> 01:14:46.954
Buddy, where are you?!

01:14:54.419 --> 01:14:58.799
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

01:14:58.799 --> 01:15:02.385
Vixen, up, up!

01:15:02.385 --> 01:15:04.512
Santa?

01:15:04.929 --> 01:15:07.932
Come on, you can do it.

01:15:07.932 --> 01:15:11.560
Pull up! Pull up!

01:15:19.401 --> 01:15:21.486
Dad! What?

01:15:21.486 --> 01:15:22.987
Michael, where you going?

01:15:22.987 --> 01:15:24.364
Michael!

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:42.881
Santa.

01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:47.593
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

01:15:47.593 --> 01:15:50.346
Buddy, is that you?

01:15:50.346 --> 01:15:51.347
Are you okay?

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:53.932
Boy, am I glad to see you.

01:15:53.932 --> 01:15:57.853
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

01:15:57.853 --> 01:16:01.481
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

01:16:01.481 --> 01:16:03.983
And then the strain was too
Much...

01:16:03.983 --> 01:16:07.486
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

01:16:12.449 --> 01:16:15.035
I need an elf's help.

01:16:15.035 --> 01:16:17.621
I... I’m not an elf, Santa.

01:16:17.621 --> 01:16:20.040
I... I can’t do anything right.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.877
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

01:16:24.877 --> 01:16:26.963
And the only one who I would want

01:16:26.963 --> 01:16:29.632
Working on my sleigh tonight.

01:16:29.632 --> 01:16:31.592
Really? Really.

01:16:31.592 --> 01:16:34.011
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

01:16:34.011 --> 01:16:36.847
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:37.681
You gotta find it first.

01:16:37.681 --> 01:16:40.475
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

01:16:40.475 --> 01:16:43.394
The engine? The engine, yeah.

01:16:43.394 --> 01:16:46.522
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

01:16:46.522 --> 01:16:47.899
Chuckles

01:16:47.899 --> 01:16:49.567
I’m standing here outside
central park

01:16:49.567 --> 01:16:53.112
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

01:16:53.112 --> 01:16:55.030
What we do know is that
authorities

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.906
Have closed the park

01:16:55.906 --> 01:16:57.157
And are in the process of
clearing it.

01:16:57.157 --> 01:16:59.910
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:03.413
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

01:17:03.413 --> 01:17:04.664
I've got an eyewitness with me

01:17:04.664 --> 01:17:06.874
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

01:17:06.874 --> 01:17:08.084
What did you actually see?

01:17:08.084 --> 01:17:10.628
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

01:17:10.628 --> 01:17:12.921
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:13.964
Oh, your daughter saw it?

01:17:13.964 --> 01:17:15.007
Sweetheart, can you tell me

01:17:15.007 --> 01:17:17.384
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:19.094
It was Santa’s sleigh!

01:17:19.094 --> 01:17:20.720
News woman chuckles

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.597
Santa’s sleigh, well, there you
have it.

01:17:22.597 --> 01:17:23.431
Santa's in Manhattan.

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:26.601
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:28.894
But New York one has just received

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.938
Some exclusive amateur news footage

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:33.023
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:36.443
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:37.944
Wandering through central park.

01:17:37.944 --> 01:17:40.947
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:42.949
You’re used to covering in buffalo
, charlotte,

01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:44.575
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

01:17:44.575 --> 01:17:47.078
News is top priority.

01:17:57.587 --> 01:18:00.090
What the heck...?

01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:01.966
Hey!

01:18:02.425 --> 01:18:05.136
You found it. Buddy!

01:18:10.558 --> 01:18:12.142
I need to tell you something.

01:18:12.142 --> 01:18:13.477
No, no. Buddy, there's something

01:18:13.477 --> 01:18:14.186
I have to tell you right now.

01:18:14.186 --> 01:18:18.064
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

01:18:18.064 --> 01:18:22.110
I know you may be a little, um, um...

01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:23.528
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

01:18:23.528 --> 01:18:26.280
But you’ve been right about a lot
of things.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:29.450
I... I don't want you to leave.

01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:33.120
You're my son, and I... love you.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.252
Uh, buddy, uh...

01:18:41.252 --> 01:18:44.130
What was it you wanted to tell me?

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:46.507
Oh, right. Come with me.

01:18:46.507 --> 01:18:48.301
Right. Come on.

01:18:54.515 --> 01:18:56.016
I'm here with another eyewitness

01:18:56.016 --> 01:18:58.310
Who has his own version of what
happened.

01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:59.477
Sir, what did you see?

01:18:59.477 --> 01:19:00.687
I think you’re great, charlotte.

01:19:00.687 --> 01:19:03.022
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

01:19:03.022 --> 01:19:04.274
Right into the middle of central
park.

01:19:04.274 --> 01:19:06.651
I mean, you’re a great news lady.

01:19:06.651 --> 01:19:07.485
Thank you.

01:19:07.485 --> 01:19:08.527
Could you tell me a bit more?

01:19:08.527 --> 01:19:09.779
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.155
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

01:19:11.155 --> 01:19:13.032
That’s what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

01:19:13.032 --> 01:19:15.158
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

01:19:15.158 --> 01:19:18.036
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

01:19:18.036 --> 01:19:19.996
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

01:19:19.996 --> 01:19:21.206
The area has been cleared.

01:19:21.206 --> 01:19:24.792
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

01:19:24.792 --> 01:19:26.627
These forces are highly trained,

01:19:26.627 --> 01:19:28.045
But rarely see action.

01:19:28.045 --> 01:19:31.173
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

01:19:31.173 --> 01:19:32.091
When called into duty,

01:19:32.091 --> 01:19:34.551
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

01:19:34.551 --> 01:19:37.554
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

01:19:37.554 --> 01:19:39.806
Are still under investigation.

01:19:39.806 --> 01:19:42.225
I knew you’d find it, Mr. Elf!

01:19:42.225 --> 01:19:45.561
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

01:19:48.022 --> 01:19:49.190
That ta boy.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.567
Chuckles

01:19:52.234 --> 01:19:55.028
So, uh... you're, uh...

01:19:55.028 --> 01:19:57.697
Santa Claus. Right.

01:19:58.824 --> 01:20:02.785
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

01:20:02.785 --> 01:20:03.328
Sure.

01:20:03.328 --> 01:20:06.539
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

01:20:06.539 --> 01:20:10.209
Yes. Actually, I’m adopted.

01:20:10.543 --> 01:20:14.546
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:22.345
That ta boy, thank you.

01:20:22.345 --> 01:20:26.057
So, you’re really Santa Claus?

01:20:26.057 --> 01:20:28.768
You never can tell, kid.

01:20:28.768 --> 01:20:29.643
Tell me, Michael,

01:20:29.643 --> 01:20:31.353
What do you want for Christmas?

01:20:31.353 --> 01:20:32.438
I wanted a skateboard.

01:20:32.438 --> 01:20:37.609
Oh, not just skateboard.

01:20:37.609 --> 01:20:41.613
A real huf board. Looked here.

01:20:41.613 --> 01:20:43.072
Looked here...

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.116
How do you like them apples?

01:20:45.116 --> 01:20:47.868
Go look and see.

01:20:54.166 --> 01:20:55.626
Whoa.

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.383
What happened?

01:21:03.383 --> 01:21:06.135
You made my sleigh fly.

01:21:06.135 --> 01:21:06.886
What do you mean?

01:21:06.886 --> 01:21:09.096
Well, before the turbine days,

01:21:09.096 --> 01:21:12.099
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

01:21:12.099 --> 01:21:16.895
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

01:21:16.895 --> 01:21:18.897
Hold it... if you’re really Santa
Claus,

01:21:18.897 --> 01:21:21.316
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

01:21:21.316 --> 01:21:22.650
And everyone will believe in you,

01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:23.735
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

01:21:23.735 --> 01:21:27.280
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.740
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:33.911
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

01:21:33.911 --> 01:21:35.454
Horse whinnies

01:21:36.705 --> 01:21:38.165
Hey, look!

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.668
Horse whinnies

01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:46.672
Oh, no.

01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:50.885
It's the central park rangers.

01:21:50.885 --> 01:21:53.137
Horses whinny

01:21:55.138 --> 01:22:00.435
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

01:22:08.192 --> 01:22:10.903
Santa: Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

01:22:10.903 --> 01:22:13.697
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

01:22:13.697 --> 01:22:15.741
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

01:22:15.741 --> 01:22:18.702
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

01:22:22.956 --> 01:22:25.958
Hey! Hey, here I am!

01:22:27.835 --> 01:22:28.794
Ho ho ho!

01:22:28.794 --> 01:22:33.465
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

01:22:40.847 --> 01:22:42.891
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.851
So the authorities have not
discovered

01:22:44.851 --> 01:22:46.727
Any reindeer in the park?

01:22:46.727 --> 01:22:48.521
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

01:22:48.521 --> 01:22:49.730
No, no sleigh bells, either.

01:22:49.730 --> 01:22:50.731
Elves? Excuse me, please.

01:22:50.731 --> 01:22:51.899
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

01:22:51.899 --> 01:22:52.983
It’s him, it's the real Santa!

01:22:52.983 --> 01:22:54.735
His sleigh won't fly,’ cause nobody
believes in him!

01:22:54.735 --> 01:22:56.695
Charlotte: Did you see something
in the park?

01:22:56.695 --> 01:22:57.362
Everyone out there,

01:22:57.362 --> 01:22:59.864
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

01:22:59.864 --> 01:23:00.740
Look, this is his list!

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:03.743
Okay... well, further confirmation

01:23:03.743 --> 01:23:06.287
That there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.

01:23:06.287 --> 01:23:07.413
We have the naughty and nice list.

01:23:07.413 --> 01:23:09.749
Lynn Kessler wants a power puff

Okay, uh, well, obviously we have

A new development in the story, uh,

01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:35.397
A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

01:23:35.397 --> 01:23:37.232
Because we have his book right
here.

01:23:37.232 --> 01:23:38.984
Chuckles what's your name?

01:23:38.984 --> 01:23:42.320
Uh, I’m charlotte den on, New York one.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.906

01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:47.575
Charlotte den on wants tiffany

01:23:47.575 --> 01:23:50.286
And for her boyfriend to stop

01:23:50.286 --> 01:23:51.370
And commit already.

01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:53.831
Crowd oohs and aahs

01:23:56.291 --> 01:23:57.250
We’ve got power!

01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:59.544
Newsman: Charlotte...

01:23:59.544 --> 01:24:01.379
Hey, turn the cameras back on!

01:24:01.379 --> 01:24:02.547
Who told you to say that?

01:24:02.547 --> 01:24:03.464
It's the real Santa.

01:24:03.464 --> 01:24:05.550
We need to get these cameras
back on.

01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:06.759
He needs our help!

01:24:06.759 --> 01:24:09.095
Hey, Michael, are you okay?

01:24:09.095 --> 01:24:09.804
Yeah, I’m fine.

01:24:09.804 --> 01:24:13.057
But buddy, he's... he’s in the
park with Santa,

01:24:13.057 --> 01:24:14.308
The sleigh won't fly

01:24:14.308 --> 01:24:16.310
'cause there’s no Christmas
spirit.

01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:18.562
Michael! Mom!

01:24:18.562 --> 01:24:21.981
Michael! Ohh!

01:24:21.981 --> 01:24:24.317
Are you okay? I'm fine.

01:24:24.317 --> 01:24:27.320
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.448
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

01:24:32.533 --> 01:24:33.992
Sighs

01:24:35.786 --> 01:24:38.830
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.499
Santa, I’m not done with the
engine yet!

01:24:41.499 --> 01:24:42.834
Can’t wait!

01:24:42.834 --> 01:24:45.420
On, dasher, on, dancer...

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.797
I’m not done with the engine!

01:24:47.797 --> 01:24:50.299
Santa cheers

01:24:51.634 --> 01:24:52.843
That’s okay.

01:24:52.843 --> 01:24:56.138
You get started, I’ll catch up!

01:25:01.017 --> 01:25:03.353
You know, he wasn't lying.

01:25:03.353 --> 01:25:06.105
Chuckles merry Christmas.

01:25:06.105 --> 01:25:07.898
Chuckles

01:25:10.943 --> 01:25:12.861
Santa, I can't...

01:25:12.861 --> 01:25:15.489
Stop messing around and get in!

01:25:15.489 --> 01:25:18.825
Aah! Toy squeals

01:25:23.871 --> 01:25:26.040
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.042
I put them on the naughty list,

01:25:28.042 --> 01:25:30.503
And they never forgave me.

01:25:35.882 --> 01:25:40.053
You better watch out,
you better not cry

01:25:40.053 --> 01:25:43.514
You better not pout,
I’m telling you why

01:25:43.514 --> 01:25:49.395
Santa Claus is coming' to town

01:25:49.395 --> 01:25:53.357
Santa: Yaah, yaah, yaah!

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:56.485
Santa: Up, up, pull up!

01:25:56.485 --> 01:26:00.989
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:05.159
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:08.996
Gonna find out who’s naughty and nice

01:26:08.996 --> 01:26:15.377
Santa claus is coming' to town

01:26:15.377 --> 01:26:19.965
He sees you when you're sleeping

01:26:19.965 --> 01:26:22.884
He knows when you're awake

01:26:22.884 --> 01:26:26.679
He knows if you've been bad or good

01:26:26.679 --> 01:26:29.432
So be good for goodness sake

01:26:29.432 --> 01:26:34.144
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

01:26:34.144 --> 01:26:38.106
You better not pout, I’m telling
you why

01:26:38.106 --> 01:26:44.195
Santa Claus is coming to town

01:26:50.534 --> 01:26:51.619
Devilish laughter aah!

01:26:51.619 --> 01:26:54.163
Santa: You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

01:26:54.163 --> 01:26:56.915
That's my boy.

01:26:56.915 --> 01:26:58.125
Pull, cupid! Aah!

01:26:58.125 --> 01:27:00.251
Pull, dasher!

01:27:00.251 --> 01:27:04.422
I'm getting too old for this job.

01:27:04.422 --> 01:27:05.923
Now!

01:27:08.718 --> 01:27:10.928
Screaming

01:27:13.972 --> 01:27:16.516
Laughing

01:27:19.227 --> 01:27:20.937
The engine's gone!

01:27:20.937 --> 01:27:22.147
We're toast!

01:27:22.147 --> 01:27:23.940
Screaming

01:27:27.735 --> 01:27:29.987
Well, still no sign of Santa,

01:27:29.987 --> 01:27:32.072
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:32.990
Has broken out

01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:35.033
Right here in front of central
park.

01:27:35.033 --> 01:27:36.118
Let's have a listen in.

01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:37.953
He sees you when you're sleeping

01:27:37.953 --> 01:27:41.498
He knows if you're awake

01:27:41.498 --> 01:27:45.460
He knows if you've been bad or
good

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:49.255
So be good for goodness sake

01:27:49.255 --> 01:27:49.713
Hey!

01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:52.716
You better watch out, you better
not cry

01:27:52.716 --> 01:27:57.262
You better not pout, I’m telling
you why

01:27:57.262 --> 01:27:57.679
Come on!

01:27:57.679 --> 01:28:03.017
Santa claus is coming' to town

01:28:03.017 --> 01:28:06.229
Santa: Just a little more!

01:28:11.275 --> 01:28:12.526
Hal-yah!

01:28:12.526 --> 01:28:15.153
He knows when you're awake

01:28:15.153 --> 01:28:16.488
He knows if you've

01:28:16.488 --> 01:28:19.032
Wait... you're not singing.

01:28:19.032 --> 01:28:20.033
Yes, I am.

01:28:20.033 --> 01:28:23.244
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

01:28:23.244 --> 01:28:25.121
Santa!

01:28:25.121 --> 01:28:27.707
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

01:28:27.707 --> 01:28:28.541
Dad.

01:28:28.541 --> 01:28:29.542
I'm telling you why

01:28:29.542 --> 01:28:35.297
Santa claus is coming to town

01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.801
Laughing

01:28:41.011 --> 01:28:43.680
Santa chuckling

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.681
Oh! Ha ha ha!

01:28:45.681 --> 01:28:47.808
Santa: Now, my beauties!

01:28:47.808 --> 01:28:49.810
Santa chuckling

01:28:55.065 --> 01:28:56.191
Bye-bye.

01:28:56.191 --> 01:28:57.567
Santa: Just like the old days!

01:28:57.567 --> 01:29:00.654
Newsman: Charlotte? Charlotte?

01:29:00.654 --> 01:29:03.364
Well, I guess we’ll never know for
sure

01:29:03.364 --> 01:29:05.366
What happened this Christmas Eve?

01:29:05.366 --> 01:29:06.742
In central park.

01:29:06.742 --> 01:29:12.873
Santa: Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

01:29:12.873 --> 01:29:15.792
Ho ho ho!

01:29:15.792 --> 01:29:18.753
Papa elf: And so, with a little help,

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:20.714
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

01:29:20.714 --> 01:29:23.591
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:30.389
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

01:29:30.389 --> 01:29:36.770
And never brought to mind

01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:44.068
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

01:29:44.068 --> 01:29:47.613
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

01:29:47.613 --> 01:29:49.865
His first book was written by a
brand new,

01:29:49.865 --> 01:29:53.077
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

01:29:53.077 --> 01:29:54.703
The book was elf...

01:29:54.703 --> 01:29:56.621
A, uh, fictional story

01:29:56.621 --> 01:29:59.207
About an adopted elf named buddy

01:29:59.207 --> 01:30:00.834
Who was raised in the North Pole?

01:30:00.834 --> 01:30:02.836
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

01:30:02.836 --> 01:30:04.295
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

01:30:04.295 --> 01:30:07.590
And eventually saved Christmas.

01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:10.342
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

01:30:10.342 --> 01:30:12.678
"Of the candy cane forest,

01:30:12.678 --> 01:30:17.307
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

01:30:17.307 --> 01:30:22.145
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

01:30:22.145 --> 01:30:24.397
And as for me, I can't complain.

01:30:24.397 --> 01:30:26.816
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

01:30:26.816 --> 01:30:31.111
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

01:30:31.111 --> 01:30:33.906
And pretend that he is parson
brown

01:30:33.906 --> 01:30:37.117
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

01:30:37.117 --> 01:30:38.660
You're welcome, papa.

01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:42.664
But you can do the job when
you're in town

01:30:42.664 --> 01:30:44.165
Hey, Suzie.

01:30:44.165 --> 01:30:45.124
Come here, little one.

01:30:45.124 --> 01:30:47.668
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

01:30:47.668 --> 01:30:49.170
Papa wants to see you.

01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:52.756
Though your nose get a
little chilling

01:30:52.756 --> 01:30:53.173
Buddy...

01:30:53.173 --> 01:30:55.467
We’ll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

01:30:55.467 --> 01:31:01.723
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

01:31:18.989 --> 01:31:23.201
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

01:31:23.201 --> 01:31:27.413
And pretend that he is parson
brown

01:31:27.413 --> 01:31:31.834
He’ll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

01:31:31.834 --> 01:31:36.213
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

01:31:36.213 --> 01:31:41.468
Later on, we'll conspire

01:31:41.468 --> 01:31:45.388
As we dream by the fire

01:31:45.388 --> 01:31:49.850
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:53.937
Walking in a winter wonderland

01:31:53.937 --> 01:31:58.483
Walking in a winter wonderland

01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:11.412
I really can't stay

01:32:11.412 --> 01:32:15.916
But, baby, it's cold outside

01:32:15.916 --> 01:32:17.000
I’ve got to go 'way

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.754
But, baby, it's cold outside

01:32:20.754 --> 01:32:23.047
This evening has been

01:32:23.047 --> 01:32:25.758
Been hoping that you'd drop in

01:32:25.758 --> 01:32:27.218
So very nice

01:32:27.218 --> 01:32:32.431
I’ll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

01:32:32.431 --> 01:32:35.267
My mother will start to worry

01:32:35.267 --> 01:32:37.477
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

01:32:37.477 --> 01:32:40.897
And father will be pacing the floor

01:32:40.897 --> 01:32:42.899
Listen to that fireplace roar

01:32:42.899 --> 01:32:45.943
So, really, I’d better scurry

01:32:45.943 --> 01:32:48.279
Beautiful, please don't hurry

01:32:48.279 --> 01:32:51.782
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

01:32:51.782 --> 01:32:54.576
Put some records on while I pour

01:32:54.576 --> 01:32:56.787
The neighbors might think

01:32:56.787 --> 01:32:59.289
Baby, it's bad out there

01:32:59.289 --> 01:33:01.041
Say, what's in this drink?

01:33:01.041 --> 01:33:05.253
No cabs to be had out there

01:33:05.253 --> 01:33:06.963
I wish I knew how

01:33:06.963 --> 01:33:09.340
Your eyes are like starlight now

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.300
To break the spell

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:16.346
I’ll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

01:33:16.346 --> 01:33:19.307
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

01:33:19.307 --> 01:33:21.434
Mind if I move in closer?

01:33:21.434 --> 01:33:24.520
At least I’m gonna say that I
tried

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.815
What’s the sense of hurting
my pride?

01:33:27.815 --> 01:33:29.525
I really can't stay

01:33:29.525 --> 01:33:31.569
Baby, don't hold out

01:33:31.569 --> 01:33:38.575
Ah, but it’s cold outside

01:33:46.833 --> 01:33:48.125
I simply must go

01:33:48.125 --> 01:33:52.087
But, baby, it's cold outside

01:33:52.087 --> 01:33:54.047
The answer is no

01:33:54.047 --> 01:33:57.342
But, baby, it's cold outside

01:33:57.342 --> 01:33:59.135
This welcome has been

01:33:59.135 --> 01:34:01.846
I’m lucky that you dropped in

01:34:01.846 --> 01:34:03.806
So nice and warm

01:34:03.806 --> 01:34:08.853
Look out the window at that
storm

01:34:08.853 --> 01:34:11.605
My sister will be suspicious

01:34:11.605 --> 01:34:14.108
Gosh, your lips look delicious

01:34:14.108 --> 01:34:17.360
My brother will be there at
the door

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.571
Waves upon tropical shore

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:22.949
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:25.034
Oh, your lips look delicious

01:34:25.034 --> 01:34:27.453
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:30.998
Never such a pleasure before

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:32.833
I’ve got to get home

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:35.544
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:37.379
Say, lend me your comb

01:34:37.379 --> 01:34:41.383
It’s up to your knees out there

01:34:41.383 --> 01:34:43.509
You’ve really been grand

01:34:43.509 --> 01:34:45.553
I thrill when you touch my hand

01:34:45.553 --> 01:34:47.680
But don’t you see

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.643
How can you do this thing to me?

01:34:52.643 --> 01:34:55.145
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

01:34:55.145 --> 01:34:58.356
Think of my lifelong sorrow

01:34:58.356 --> 01:35:01.067
At least there will be plenty
implied

01:35:01.067 --> 01:35:04.070
If you caught pneumonia and died

01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:05.696
I really can't stay

01:35:05.696 --> 01:35:08.157
Get rid of that hold out

01:35:08.157 --> 01:35:12.161
Ah, but it's cold

01:35:12.161 --> 01:35:17.916
Outside
