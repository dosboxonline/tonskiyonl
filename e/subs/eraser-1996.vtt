02:58.178 --> 03:01.973
You couldn't hide, Johnny.
Nobody hides from us.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.691
Shit! Benny, get me some ice. I
think I broke my goddamn hand.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.401
Sure, boss.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.546
Fuck you! Just do me quick.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.925
Sure, Johnny. But first, Mr. Canelli
wants a little souvenir.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.848
Open up. Open up!

03:43.014 --> 03:46.309
We're gonna forward this to your
buddies in Witness Protection.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.228
See if it sings on its own.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.897
They can take it to the trial.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.859
Open up, Johnny. Open up!

03:57.821 --> 03:59.197
Benny?

04:04.035 --> 04:05.328
Hello?

04:16.339 --> 04:17.591
Who in the hell are you?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.184
-Close your eyes. -Who are you?

04:27.350 --> 04:28.393
Shut up!

04:30.187 --> 04:31.605
Who--?

04:34.065 --> 04:36.359
-You too. JOHNNY: It's okay.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.069
You do what he says.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.364
Don't move. You're dead.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.288
I need the clothes you're wearing.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.583
And your ring, your watch...

04:51.750 --> 04:56.213
-...all your IDs. Now.
-Uh-- Shh! Do it.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.218
You come with me.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.392
Grab the other one.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.811
Let's go.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.331
Put your clothes on them. Move!

05:56.731 --> 05:59.192
Yes, there's been a murder
at 232 Alden Drive.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.237
-Send the police. -What are you doing?

06:02.946 --> 06:06.283
They killed you, then they
turned on each other.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.369
Right.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.663
Those sons of bitches.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.712
-Shit! -Don't worry.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.881
This doesn't work without an audience.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.805
Outside. Let's go.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.364
Get in.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.684
Thank you. Thank you, man.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.437
Anything you ever need,
anything, you just ask me.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.323
You endangered your life
and the lives of U.S.

07:19.336 --> 07:21.066
marshals protecting you.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.486
-What are you talking about? -You
were spotted at your old restaurant.

07:24.653 --> 07:28.490
You went back to Gennaro's?
Johnny, what are you, stupid?

07:28.657 --> 07:29.866
Hey, it's the osso buco.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.244
I haven't had a decent meal in six months.
I was fucking dying, okay?

07:33.411 --> 07:36.247
The next time, you're dead.
This only happens once.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.506
Get out.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.815
What are you doing? That was our ride.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.319
Let's go. Go.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.156
You'll never see me again, but
I'll know every move you make.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.410
Use your heads, lie low, and I
promise no one will hurt you.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.712
If you try to skip out
on your testimony, I'll

08:15.725 --> 08:17.872
deliver you to the
Canelli family myself.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.907
-I promise. JOHNNY: Hey, listen, man.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.249
Look, I owe you bigtime.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.919
I'm a standup guy, you got it?

08:23.086 --> 08:25.180
You ever need anything,
anything, you let me know.

08:25.193 --> 08:27.298
Hey, what's your name?

08:27.465 --> 08:30.301
-Easy, I don't think he wants
to be pen pals. MAN: Smile.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.761
You've just been erased.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.453
MAN: Go ahead.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.336
Hey, John, would you look at something?

09:07.130 --> 09:10.675
One of these is from our shop and the
others are real. What do you think?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.475
That's the fake.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.646
-Who the hell was that? -I could
tell you, but I'd have to kill you.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.191
Now shut up and run this again.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.198
DEGUERIN: So with a
little sleight of hand...

10:15.365 --> 10:19.869
...one very dead John Doe trades
places with one very live scumbag.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.955
-Robert, sit down. -John.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.124
You know...

10:27.210 --> 10:30.713
...if God was as forgiving as WitSec...

10:30.880 --> 10:34.801
-...hell would be one empty joint, no?
-God doesn't have our court system.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.848
So I understand you had a busy night.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.933
A couple of witnesses got careless.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.352
-I see. -I had to defuse the situation.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.355
Did that--? Did that include
breaking into the county morgue?

10:48.398 --> 10:52.777
Someone once taught me that improvisation
is the heart of fieldwork.

10:52.944 --> 10:56.447
-I think it was you. -In the old days.
The weather's changed.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.909
Now you got every asshole in
Congress, you know, down our backs.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.703
I'm telling you to walk softly.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.373
Is that why Beller called me in?
Because of the morgue?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.709
Oh, no, no, no.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.325
The old man doesn't know
anything about that,

11:10.338 --> 11:12.589
and personally, I don't
think he has to.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.883
Shadow Ops still has some privileges.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.510
You're right.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.513
Oh, and John...

11:21.598 --> 11:24.309
-...that's good work.
-I had a good teacher.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.687
Bullshit. You had the best.

11:33.026 --> 11:37.530
Fourteen thousand, six hundred and forty
some-odd people under WitSec protection...

11:37.697 --> 11:41.701
-...and not one with a profile like this.
-That bad?

11:41.868 --> 11:44.913
That good. This young lady, Miss Cullen...

11:45.079 --> 11:47.916
...is a real live, bona fide...

11:48.082 --> 11:49.626
...honest person.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.628
Then why does she need us?

11:51.794 --> 11:54.589
She's a senior executive at
Cyrez Corporation. Hear of it?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.466
Yeah, major defense contractors.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.635
Mostly top-secret weapons research.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.805
Looks like someone inside Cyrez
is selling out Uncle Sam.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.225
Feds need her to prove their case.
If they do...

12:05.391 --> 12:08.728
...she'll be the key witness in the
hottest scandal since Iran-Contra.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.563
-When does this go down? -Tomorrow.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.651
The sting's all in place. Soon
as it's over, she's all yours.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.153
Seal file on relocate. Your eyes only.

12:17.362 --> 12:21.407
As usual, only you and I'll be privy
to your witness' exact location.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.659
But, John...

12:23.076 --> 12:26.829
...there are some serious players
here in Washington that...

12:26.996 --> 12:28.623
...could be badly burned.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.672
Then so could she.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.192
WOMAN [OVER SPEAKERS]: Welcome
to Cyrez Corporation.

12:56.359 --> 13:00.113
All visitors are required to step in
the security stations on the right.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.199
Please be prepared to present
valid identification.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.622
-Good morning, Dave. -Good morning.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.714
She's in.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.217
MAN 1: She giving us anything yet?
-Not yet.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.098
MAN 2: That's right, Lee.
We're right here with you.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.660
We're on.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.624
-Can you hear me? -We hear you, Lee.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.627
-I look okay? -Tell her she looks great.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.379
Not bad, Miss Cullen.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.506
Not bad for an amateur.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.384
We're right with you, Lee.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.556
-Yeah. -Then let's do it.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.731
-Good morning, Miss Cullen.
LEE: Good morning.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.524
Station C?

14:19.317 --> 14:22.528
-Yes. -And how long today?

14:22.695 --> 14:23.738
Ten minutes, max.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.784
Okay.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.219
You're doing just fine, Lee.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.531
Let's hope we bought the right
combination, gentlemen.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.575
Bingo!

15:13.704 --> 15:15.248
-Shit! -No, it's okay.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.250
We lose transmission in the vault.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.545
-What do we do now? -Now we wait.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.758
She better move fast because she's only
got five minutes till the shift change.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.745
What's taking so long?

16:36.162 --> 16:38.789
Come on, sweetheart, you
got two minutes left.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.748
-We should have never used her.
-Shit! She's out of time.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.650
-Hey! -Yes!

17:47.817 --> 17:50.236
Welcome back, Lee. We're
right here with you.

17:57.868 --> 18:02.039
Miss Cullen, Mr. Donahue's office called.
He'd like to see you.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.293
-Tell him I'll be up in a minute.
-He said, "Right now."

18:05.543 --> 18:07.420
-What's going on? -I think they made us.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.351
Check the directory. I wanna
know where Donahue's office is.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.229
-Twenty-fifth floor. -I know where it is.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.647
Twenty-fifth floor.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.067
Get backup ready to roll. This
whole thing could go south.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.113
What is it, William?

18:38.993 --> 18:41.287
That's someone I trusted for five years.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.415
Someone I told others could be trusted.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.293
-Well, I was pulling the stack-- -Don't!

18:48.753 --> 18:51.714
We're way beyond bullshit here.

18:58.596 --> 18:59.722
Who are you working for?

19:01.223 --> 19:02.433
Shit, we're dead.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.102
I should ask you that question.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.438
I used to think it was for the U.S.
government.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.940
Oh, come on, Lee.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.318
What do you think we do here?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.612
This isn't the Red Cross.

19:14.779 --> 19:18.032
We make weapons, things that kill people.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.160
If the government isn't
willing to pay the price...

19:21.327 --> 19:23.496
...it's my job to find somebody who will.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.750
I didn't know treason was part
of the corporate strategy.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.879
I asked who you were working for.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.422
You didn't tell me.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.592
-Oh, my God. -Holy shit.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.097
Christ.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.641
Get her out of there. Get
her out of there now!

19:44.809 --> 19:46.727
What is this?

19:47.645 --> 19:49.563
A camera?

19:54.110 --> 19:58.447
I'm working for the FBI, William.
They heard everything you just said.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.157
They're watching us right now.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.746
And you think that makes you safe?

20:10.042 --> 20:13.254
You have no fucking idea!

20:14.797 --> 20:16.632
How could you do this to me?

20:22.847 --> 20:25.307
I hope you understand, Lee.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.102
You leave me no choice.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.200
Welcome to Cyrez Corporation.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.704
All visitors are required to step in
the security stations on the right.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.164
Security.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.666
Wait a minute. Stop her!

20:51.667 --> 20:53.961
MAN: Stop! Hey!

20:56.172 --> 20:57.590
Lee.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.008
Go, go, go!

21:02.219 --> 21:04.346
Suspect's fleeing--

21:06.557 --> 21:08.350
MAN 1: Our hard evidence.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.770
It's all yours, gentlemen.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.191
We've handled these types
of situations before.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.359
You still haven't answered my question.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.195
We told you there'd be risks.

21:19.653 --> 21:23.240
You also told me I would be under
complete protection the entire time.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.202
The operation didn't go as
smoothly as we anticipated.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.912
I'd say that's an understatement.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.623
Remember, Miss Cullen, you came to us.

21:30.789 --> 21:34.376
I came to you with a clerical error.
You asked for my help.

21:34.543 --> 21:35.836
MAN 2: And we got it.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.381
If Cyrez is selling weapons
technology, that's high treason.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.789
This disk and your
testimony will help us put

21:41.802 --> 21:44.053
them and their
coconspirators behind bars.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.972
You've done a great service for
your country, Miss Cullen.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.226
Now it's time to think about your safety.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.736
MAN 3: This is U.S. Marshal John Kruger
of the Witness Protection Program.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.780
He'll be handling your personal security.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.115
My protection?

22:05.282 --> 22:08.702
Your new identity, relocation. I'll
take you through it step by step.

22:09.912 --> 22:12.581
What are you talking about?
I'm not going anywhere.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.335
You're in an extremely high-risk
situation, Miss Cullen.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.296
That should have been explained to you.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.883
Your boss was just a middleman, Lee.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.135
There are more dangerous people involved.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.847
So you expect me to, what, give
up my whole life over this?

22:29.014 --> 22:32.226
Just until the trial. Then you'll
be completely out of danger.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.186
And how do you know that, huh?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.146
-How do you know? -Miss Cullen--

22:36.313 --> 22:40.901
No, look, I will keep up my end
of the bargain. I will testify.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.778
But that's it.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.072
I'm going home.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.163
Put people on her right away...

22:53.330 --> 22:55.791
...or we'll need a seance
to get her testimony.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.961
-Who brought her into this?
MAN 1: She volunteered.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.630
She had security clearance,
we had the vault code so--

23:01.797 --> 23:03.591
You told her it's a walk in the park.

23:03.757 --> 23:07.177
When she finds out that her life isn't
her own anymore, it's too late.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.680
-We had no case without her. JOHN: Right.

23:09.847 --> 23:14.018
It's a lot easier to put her ass
on the line than yours, isn't it?

23:27.323 --> 23:29.658
-Sully. -Frediano, how you doing?

23:29.825 --> 23:33.537
-Good. I have a little something for you.
SULLY: Let's see what you got.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.128
-Your receipt. -Thank you.

23:41.295 --> 23:44.298
SULLY: Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.708
It's me.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.919
Your music has arrived.

25:34.116 --> 25:36.577
Get Mr. Morehart down here immediately.

26:03.645 --> 26:04.980
-Hello? LEE: It's me.

26:05.147 --> 26:08.525
Lee? Jesus, I heard about Donahue.
Are you okay?

26:08.692 --> 26:10.402
I'm fine. You're right.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.121
-I shouldn't have trusted them.
-Of course not.

26:12.134 --> 26:13.697
The feds are idiots.

26:13.864 --> 26:16.325
They'll either blow the case or bury it.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.537
-Lee? -The feds are here now.

26:21.747 --> 26:22.956
They're watching me.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.794
You let me write this story and I will
nail Cyrez all over the front page.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.004
It may not be safe to talk on this phone.

26:37.471 --> 26:41.058
-I'll call you later. -Wait.
Did you make a copy?

26:41.225 --> 26:43.143
-Yeah. -That's your insurance, Lee.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.771
You go public and they
won't dare touch you.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.819
Lee? Lee, what's wrong?

26:51.985 --> 26:54.321
I don't know. I gotta go.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.955
-Hi, baby. -Darryl, what the
hell are you doing here?

27:03.122 --> 27:05.707
Been waiting for you. Getting cleaned up.
How you doing?

27:05.874 --> 27:08.335
So, what, you just let
yourself into my house, huh?

27:08.502 --> 27:12.214
I've been worried about you, that's all.
I haven't heard from you in days.

27:12.381 --> 27:16.301
Well, there's nothing left to talk about.
It's over, and you know that.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.993
Come on, Lee. That doesn't
hurt you to say that?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.744
LEE: It hurt me three months ago.

27:42.911 --> 27:48.000
But after the phone calls, after
the notes on my car and tonight...

27:48.167 --> 27:50.586
...believe me, it's getting a lot easier.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.109
MAN [WHISPERING]: Get down.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.088
You're seeing someone, aren't you?

28:35.255 --> 28:38.300
-Come on, Darryl. -I know
you're seeing somebody.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.388
-Let's see who that is. -Darryl.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.852
Oh, what's this? And a card.

28:49.019 --> 28:50.145
JOHN: Get down!

28:52.981 --> 28:54.024
Hey!

28:58.070 --> 28:59.905
Oh, shit! Go, go, go!

29:12.584 --> 29:13.794
Come here.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.882
Stay down.

29:30.227 --> 29:31.603
I don't have a shot.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.383
You, go, go.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.871
-What are you doing? -Lighting a fuse.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.143
-Are you hit? -What?

31:35.310 --> 31:38.146
-Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?
-I don't think so.

31:39.106 --> 31:41.858
-Are they following us?
-No. Just calm down.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.652
You're gonna be fine.

31:43.819 --> 31:44.986
I'm not gonna be fine.

31:45.153 --> 31:49.032
Look, they just tried to kill me.
And Darryl.... Darryl's dead.

31:49.199 --> 31:53.412
Lee, you're alive, and
I'll keep you that way.

31:56.540 --> 31:57.833
Your hand.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.295
There's a first-aid kit under your seat.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.676
That weapon, or whatever the hell it was...

32:07.843 --> 32:10.011
...it was from your
company, Cyrez, wasn't it?

32:10.345 --> 32:13.682
Yeah, it's an E.M. prototype.
It's not even supposed to exist.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.768
-E.M.? -Electromagnetic pulse.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.604
No gunpowder, no conventional bullets.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.524
They fire aluminum rounds at
almost the speed of light.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.068
You're talking about a rail gun.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.279
Yeah, that's another name for them.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.115
The Navy has been working
on them for years.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.201
The smallest one I've ever heard
of is mounted on a battleship.

32:33.743 --> 32:36.580
Well, Cyrez was contracted
to scale them down...

32:36.746 --> 32:39.541
...to design a compact
hypervelocity pulse weapon...

32:39.708 --> 32:42.002
...the most powerful
assault rifle on earth.

32:42.169 --> 32:44.880
They took millions, then said
the physics were impossible.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.382
It looked real enough to me.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.468
Maybe Cyrez found a higher bidder.

32:49.801 --> 32:54.139
Well, they're connected
everywhere: Defense, CIA, NSA...

32:54.306 --> 32:56.933
...maybe even your people, for all we know.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.228
You still want to put them away?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.024
Yes.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.402
I'll hide you until the hearings.

33:07.569 --> 33:10.989
No one will know where.
Not my boss, not WitSec.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.783
-No one. -Can you do that?

33:14.034 --> 33:16.578
The feds knew this would be
a death sentence for you...

33:16.745 --> 33:18.330
...and let you walk right into it.

33:19.497 --> 33:20.665
I was stupid.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.960
You trusted them, that's all.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.587
Now trust me.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.188
This is Morehart. We have a problem.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.399
Go ahead. This line's secure.

33:47.984 --> 33:51.321
-The Cullen woman is still alive.
-Are you serious?

33:51.488 --> 33:54.199
It gets worse. She has a disk.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.619
She tried to access our program with it.

33:58.745 --> 34:02.582
You have any idea the risk
I took to get this back?

34:02.749 --> 34:05.252
I know. I know. She must
have made a duplicate.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.630
Then get it. Whatever it takes, get it!

34:08.797 --> 34:10.715
Understood.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.176
One other thing.

34:13.342 --> 34:16.513
-I checked her phone records. -And?

34:16.804 --> 34:19.349
She called a woman named Isaacs.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.810
A reporter for the Washington Herald.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.481
I see.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.527
I think you know what has to be done.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.320
Do it.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.995
The Joint Chiefs are
ready, Mr. Undersecretary.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.998
Tell them I'll be right with them.
Lieutenant, thank you.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.524
That's it. That's everything I am.

35:09.691 --> 35:10.942
No, that's nothing.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.778
It's a few numbers and some plastic.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.406
What you are is in here...

35:16.573 --> 35:19.534
...and no one can take that from you.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.371
They're gonna try.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.665
We'll stop them.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.049
I need the rest.

35:34.215 --> 35:37.594
-That's all there is. -No, this.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.138
-This? -Yeah.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.229
It's St. George.

35:50.065 --> 35:54.861
It's silly, but when I was a kid I used to
have these nightmares about dragons so--

35:55.028 --> 35:56.237
-He watched over you. -Yeah.

35:56.529 --> 35:59.991
Well, that's my job now.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.039
Get some sleep.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.875
We leave at dawn.

36:09.042 --> 36:11.002
-Okay. -Okay.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.754
Night.

36:30.271 --> 36:33.942
JOHN: There's a place I know
where it's easy to disappear.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.863
There's a woman there I've helped before.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.325
She testified against the
yakuza bosses in San Francisco.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.036
Her new name is Mei-Ling.

36:45.286 --> 36:48.373
You'll be safe with her until the hearings.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.642
Your new name is Deborah Elliott.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.729
Is that how you think of me, as a Deborah?

37:10.895 --> 37:12.105
I don't know.

37:12.397 --> 37:15.525
I guess I could have used
something more fun, like...

37:15.692 --> 37:17.193
...Debbie?

37:17.360 --> 37:19.904
-Deb? -Deborah's fine.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.322
I gave you AAA credit.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.660
-What's my limit? -No, it's
not a license to shop.

37:25.869 --> 37:29.289
I want you to lay low right now.
Mei-Ling will take good care of you.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.250
Okay? You know the signal.

37:32.459 --> 37:34.335
Nine-one-one. I get out of the apartment.

37:34.544 --> 37:37.338
Remember, go straight to the pay
phone and wait for my call.

37:37.505 --> 37:42.010
Anything happens, it's a public place
with six exits and six ways out.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.219
One more thing.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.805
I work alone.

37:45.972 --> 37:49.225
If anyone comes to you and
claims that I sent them...

37:51.186 --> 37:52.395
...use this.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.732
All you have to do is pull the trigger.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.028
I guess I won't see you again.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.198
If everything goes well, no.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.534
Well, at least not until the trial.

38:09.704 --> 38:10.747
Thanks.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.166
Thank me when it's over.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.058
MAN [ON TV]: Undersecretary
of Defense, Daniel Harper...

38:30.225 --> 38:33.853
...spoke before Congress today about
the controversial Cyrez scandal.

38:34.020 --> 38:37.065
HARPER: The use of private contractors
is totally within the parameters...

38:37.232 --> 38:39.067
...of Defense Department spending.

38:39.234 --> 38:42.728
I look forward to the Cyrez hearing,
and I'm absolutely confident...

38:42.778 --> 38:46.199
...that we will be vindicated
of any mismanagement of funds.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.711
Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
for the opportunity.

38:48.724 --> 38:50.620
Thank you very much.

39:03.800 --> 39:04.926
Hey, John.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.262
Thanks for coming.

39:07.428 --> 39:10.348
You know I don't like meeting
outside of our normal channels.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.267
It's not my choice.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.310
Are they with you?

39:16.229 --> 39:17.689
Yeah.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.903
Whether I like it or not.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.947
Listen, John...

39:27.782 --> 39:30.868
-...we got a serious problem.
-What's going on?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.289
Someone's been murdering our witnesses.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.375
We've got three confirmed
kills in the last 48 hours.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.127
-Who? -Not one of yours.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.045
It's not one of mine. Not yet anyway.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.214
-Did they break cover? -No.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.216
No, that is the problem.

39:45.383 --> 39:49.137
And there's no way anyone could
know all three of their locations.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.184
There's a mole inside WitSec.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.979
Beller thinks so. He may be right.

39:58.521 --> 40:02.942
Hell, all three singers were witnesses
in some high-profile federal cases.

40:03.109 --> 40:07.405
All with international ties.
That's our common thread.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.437
There are other singers
that fit the profile.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.075
Six, to be exact.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.995
One of them's yours and
one on them's mine. So...

40:14.162 --> 40:16.915
...we have to live-contact and
replant them immediately.

40:17.081 --> 40:19.250
The jet is fueling as we speak.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.462
I work alone. You know that.

40:22.837 --> 40:25.840
Not today. Beller's orders.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.801
Buddy system, CIA escorts...

40:28.968 --> 40:30.637
...three teams. We're one of them.

40:30.929 --> 40:34.223
Fine. We do yours first.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.528
Gentlemen, this is John Kruger.

40:47.695 --> 40:51.157
John, these are Agents Schiff and Calderon.
I forgot which is which.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.034
-I'm Schiff. -And I'm Calderon.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.870
-You know her? -Should I?

40:56.037 --> 40:58.257
She was a reporter doing
a piece on Cyrez.

40:58.270 --> 41:00.500
There could be a connection
to your witness.

41:00.667 --> 41:03.920
JOHN: Did someone take her out?
CALDERON: Peeled her like an onion.

41:04.087 --> 41:06.673
If she knew anything, she talked.

41:07.674 --> 41:12.011
Oh, John, this here is Deputy Monroe.
He's one of ours.

41:12.178 --> 41:15.556
Monroe, you're looking at a legend.
This is Mr. John Kruger.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.850
-Deputy. -Sir, it's a pleasure.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.524
Nice rig.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.776
-How many of these you got? -Three.

41:26.943 --> 41:30.488
In different parts of the country.
Handy for quick relocates.

41:30.655 --> 41:34.033
Sometimes we run violent
felons for the feds.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.786
Chauffeurs for degenerates.

41:36.953 --> 41:39.372
Don't you ever get tired
of babysitting scum?

41:39.539 --> 41:41.124
Yeah.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.502
But in your case, I'll make an exception.

41:49.549 --> 41:52.760
-Who the hell does this
guy think he is? -Him?

41:52.927 --> 41:55.680
Well, he thinks he's the
best guy in the game.

41:55.847 --> 41:59.475
I think he's right. Try not
to piss him off, okay?

42:27.003 --> 42:29.630
...you're east, you're west...

42:29.797 --> 42:31.299
...you're north. Here.

42:31.466 --> 42:34.135
We got the boathouse, the
garage, the back door.

42:34.302 --> 42:37.305
-We take the front entrance?
-You and me, old buddy.

42:38.139 --> 42:40.266
Look, I don't feel like
getting shot today...

42:40.433 --> 42:42.351
...so keep your goddamn safeties on.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.729
We'll probably find her
inside baking muffins.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.272
Now, this is my witness.

42:46.439 --> 42:49.484
Her name is Allison. She's
a very, very nice lady...

42:49.650 --> 42:52.820
-...so let's bring her out
safely, gentlemen. -Here you go.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.784
Let's go, big guy.

43:10.797 --> 43:13.132
The engine's still warm.

44:49.270 --> 44:50.646
MAN: Shut up.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.483
-You're early. -You're late.

45:21.093 --> 45:24.096
Hush, hush, hush. Hush, now.
Hush, now. Shh, shh.

45:25.932 --> 45:29.268
He won't hurt you. He
won't hurt you anymore.

45:42.198 --> 45:43.532
She's hit, get an ambulance.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.826
Go on.

45:47.328 --> 45:49.330
Sorry, honey.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.183
We lost her.

46:10.935 --> 46:13.938
Why send five men to kill one woman?

46:17.858 --> 46:19.151
They were waiting for us.

46:19.694 --> 46:20.903
We've been set up.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.242
Is she yours?

46:30.454 --> 46:32.123
-Yeah. -Call her now, John.

46:32.373 --> 46:34.750
There are no phones. We
have to live-contact her.

46:35.334 --> 46:38.254
-Where is she? -Atlanta.

46:39.755 --> 46:42.216
Okay. Well, let's move, then, huh?

46:57.606 --> 47:00.067
Here. You'll like this better.

47:17.043 --> 47:18.335
You all right there, Monroe?

47:20.379 --> 47:21.922
Yeah, I think so, sir.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.008
-First time under fire? -Yeah.

47:27.636 --> 47:28.929
It's okay to be shaky.

47:29.096 --> 47:32.016
I mean, hell, I'm shaky. All right?

47:33.309 --> 47:35.394
The thing is, sir...

47:36.103 --> 47:38.064
...I don't know what I feel.

47:38.230 --> 47:42.443
-I mean, it was terrible and all--
-What, exciting at the same time?

47:42.777 --> 47:44.487
-Yeah. -Hey...

47:44.653 --> 47:48.407
...it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's the
most natural thing in the whole world.

47:49.116 --> 47:51.285
-Tell him. -Yeah, it's natural.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.545
The whole game's that way.

48:03.339 --> 48:07.051
It's like a drug. You get hooked,
there's no turning back.

48:30.032 --> 48:31.742
Now, you take me.

48:32.785 --> 48:34.787
My old man...

48:35.496 --> 48:37.123
...a little nobody in D.C.

48:38.707 --> 48:39.875
Nice, quiet guy.

48:40.668 --> 48:43.170
Anyway, on his deathbed...

48:43.337 --> 48:48.175
...he tells me that all those
years he was working for the CIA.

48:48.509 --> 48:50.344
I had to be part of that world.

48:50.511 --> 48:53.681
I joined the CIA, couple of
years, here I am at WitSec.

49:17.121 --> 49:19.081
Hey, buddy.

49:19.540 --> 49:22.543
What about you, sir? Why
did you join WitSec?

49:25.754 --> 49:27.631
Sir, is something wrong?

49:28.132 --> 49:29.633
Well, answer the kid, John.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.427
Go ahead, tell him.

49:32.052 --> 49:33.679
Sir?

49:35.598 --> 49:37.349
DEGUERIN: Come on, John.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.938
You.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.622
Sir, what the hell is going on?

50:04.126 --> 50:05.461
Shit, he cleared the numbers.

50:05.628 --> 50:07.713
-Sir, what the hell is going on? -Quiet.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.840
Hey, did you capture that call?

50:15.596 --> 50:17.681
Got it. New York prefix.

50:19.767 --> 50:21.352
Taxi!

50:23.646 --> 50:24.688
City Zoo.

50:25.272 --> 50:26.982
DEGUERIN: New York. Tell
him to change course.

50:27.149 --> 50:29.944
MONROE: I'll call WitSec. -What?
No, that won't be necessary.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.613
We're supposed to report any
change in the flight plan.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.908
Monroe. Monroe, you did great
work back there. Sit down.

50:36.075 --> 50:37.117
Sit down.

50:38.410 --> 50:40.538
Did I give you your evaluation yet?

50:41.539 --> 50:42.915
-Evaluation? -Yeah.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.669
A-plus, kid.

50:48.128 --> 50:51.382
Goddamn it. Get me a Wet-Nap
or something, will you?

50:52.007 --> 50:55.052
-Who do we have in New York?
-Four or five guys we can trust.

50:56.595 --> 50:58.138
Get them ready.

50:58.305 --> 51:00.182
Clean this mess up.

51:24.748 --> 51:25.833
Confused, pal?

51:27.459 --> 51:28.586
New York.

51:29.003 --> 51:30.254
You're off course.

51:31.380 --> 51:33.465
No, no, no. No, we're not.

51:35.301 --> 51:36.969
You're gonna take us to her, John.

51:43.517 --> 51:46.687
You did a very, very bad thing, John.

51:47.771 --> 51:48.856
You killed Monroe.

51:53.193 --> 51:55.612
Now that makes you the mole.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.781
No.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.075
That makes you a murderer.

52:02.244 --> 52:03.370
Easy, Big John.

52:07.333 --> 52:08.667
I'm a businessman.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.548
A very, very serious businessman.

52:14.715 --> 52:15.924
A businessman?

52:16.592 --> 52:19.094
Selling weapons with
your old CIA pals, huh?

52:19.511 --> 52:21.305
Is it just the money?

52:21.472 --> 52:24.224
Trying to start your own
dirty little war somewhere?

52:24.475 --> 52:28.395
Wars? Wars? Wars, John? John, John.

52:28.562 --> 52:32.608
I mean, wars, they come and go.
What? We did Nam, we lost.

52:33.067 --> 52:36.570
We did the Gulf, we won. Hey.
What changed, John?

52:37.029 --> 52:40.032
Nothing. Nothing ever does.

52:40.574 --> 52:43.327
The only difference is who
gets rich and who gets dead.

52:43.494 --> 52:46.497
Personally, John, I prefer rich, no?

52:46.789 --> 52:48.957
You must be a very rich man by now.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.365
You know, it doesn't have
to end like this, John.

52:51.378 --> 52:53.504
I can make you part of it.
A big part.

52:54.380 --> 52:57.174
All you have to do is give up the girl.
What do you say?

52:57.716 --> 52:59.009
Drop your gun.

52:59.885 --> 53:00.969
What?

53:01.470 --> 53:03.472
If you drop your gun now...

53:03.639 --> 53:05.516
...I promise I won't kill you.

53:11.355 --> 53:13.440
I guess I'll have to take my chances, John.

53:34.628 --> 53:35.629
John!

53:39.883 --> 53:43.720
I can't believe you nailed me with
this cheap piece of mail-order shit!

53:56.650 --> 53:57.735
Think about it, John.

53:57.901 --> 54:00.487
You jump, you'll go through
like shit through a goose!

54:00.654 --> 54:02.531
You're right!

54:15.335 --> 54:17.838
Engine fire! Fire, Number 3, Bob.

55:40.045 --> 55:41.338
DEGUERIN: Turn this thing around.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.757
We got a mayday. I'm trying
to keep us in the air.

55:43.924 --> 55:46.468
You turn it around and take him out now.

56:04.278 --> 56:07.656
I want his face all over this windshield.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.654
Oh, man. Did that hurt?

57:28.820 --> 57:31.031
It had to hurt. I saw it.

57:33.158 --> 57:36.620
-Where is this? -Earth. Welcome.

57:44.002 --> 57:46.797
-Is that your daddy's truck? -Yeah.

57:47.381 --> 57:50.425
Do you think he'd mind if I borrow it?

57:50.592 --> 57:52.511
I don't know.

57:52.886 --> 57:55.055
Is this yours?

57:57.224 --> 57:59.601
-Do you like it? -Oh, yes.

57:59.977 --> 58:02.020
What about a trade?

58:03.438 --> 58:05.065
Fifty bucks.

58:05.857 --> 58:07.984
Fifty bucks?

58:21.957 --> 58:23.625
Shit.

58:23.792 --> 58:26.545
We traced her number to
Chinatown, but she was long gone.

58:26.712 --> 58:29.089
No shit, Dick Tracy. That was a run signal.

58:29.256 --> 58:32.134
-What about the cab companies?
-Three pickups of solo women...

58:32.300 --> 58:34.636
...in the vicinity within
15 minutes of the call.

58:34.803 --> 58:36.012
Where were the drop-offs?

58:36.388 --> 58:39.266
Madison and 53rd, 89th
and Central Park West...

58:39.433 --> 58:40.809
...and the New York City Zoo.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.311
-That's it. That's it. -The zoo?

58:43.478 --> 58:46.273
First a run signal, then straight
to a public meeting place.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.191
-Where are your shooters? -Standing by.

58:48.358 --> 58:52.279
Get them. I want two teams to sweep from
the north and the south. Let's go, now.

58:53.321 --> 58:54.865
Go!

59:26.480 --> 59:28.848
MAN [OVER SPEAKERS]: Ladies and
gentlemen, your attention.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.649
The zoo will be closing in 10 minutes.

59:30.817 --> 59:33.695
-Please proceed to the nearest exit.
MAN: Miss Cullen?

59:33.987 --> 59:35.706
It's-- It's all right,
ma'am, I'm here to help.

59:35.719 --> 59:37.449
I'm a U.S. marshal.

59:38.867 --> 59:40.160
Where's John Kruger?

59:40.702 --> 59:45.040
He's on his way. He sent me to be
sure you're safe until he gets here.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.712
Really?

59:51.505 --> 59:55.675
Then he must have shown
you the secret handshake.

59:55.842 --> 59:57.260
Right.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:01.848
God! Shit!

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:03.475
DeGuerin!

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:09.147
-Yeah? -That bitch just shot me!

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:13.401
We're on our way. Take her down if you
have to, but don't kill her, you hear me?

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:17.531
What's going on?

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:21.076
-U.S. marshal. Close the gates, exits.
-There's still people inside.

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:24.538
-Well, fine, then get them out, now!
-All right, let's go.

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.531
You two, right here.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:28.582
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
please exit the zoo.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:33.839
Let's go. Let's go, immediately!
Police emergency. Thank you.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:53.233
Come on!

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.441
He's here.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.483
Hold your fire! Come on, Lee...

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:19.569
...it doesn't have to be like this.
Just drop your weapon.

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:31.164
Go! Move! Go!

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.676
-You're late. -Traffic.

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:48.807
-How's your ammo? -I'm out.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:51.685
Damn it. Two rounds left.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.313
-Move! -Are you ready to go?

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.023
-Yeah. -Stay down.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.484
When I tell you, head for the door.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.445
Go.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:46.531
Let's go.

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:31.034
You're luggage.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:53.973
BELLER: You said how many casualties?

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:57.018
Total, three of my men. Kruger
took them out like that, cold.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:05:00.146
-I can't believe this. -His
prints were all over the weapon.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:03.358
You've run prints on him already?
That's moving fast, Robert.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:06.319
Hey, I was there. I saw it.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.572
Doesn't make sense. Why would
he do a thing like this?

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.784
Look, the man has no
family, he has no friends.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:15.995
He has nothing to keep him honest.
He's been bought.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:19.582
-It's just I've known John for
years-- -Sir, we're losing time.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:22.460
I mean, if he is innocent, you
tell me why he's on the run.

01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:24.087
What about his witness?

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.713
She's in it with him.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.882
-What the hell do you mean? -Hey, hey.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:31.469
We approached her, we identified ourselves.
She shot one of my men.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.141
All right, fine.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:40.228
Do whatever it takes. You bring him in.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:43.982
-But, Robert? -Sir?

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:47.318
You bring him in alive.

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.453
-Hey, captain. -Sir?

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.455
I want you to put out a citywide APB.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:03.710
I want this town locked up so
tight, it'll make his balls ache.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:29.611
Beller here.

01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:31.696
-Captain. -John, where are you?

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:34.145
DeGuerin is the mole.
He's after my witness.

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:36.451
He's killed the others
just to flush her out.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:39.037
-You have to come in. -I
have to protect my witness.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.915
You're putting her in danger.
You'll both end up dead.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:45.793
DeGuerin has been bought.
My witness knows too much.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.713
I've got federal agents that
say you are the shooter.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.343
-John? -I'll call you back.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.596
-When? -When I have proof.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:06.940
It's gone too far.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:10.109
We're on our own.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.070
LEE: What are we gonna do?

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:14.781
We can't stay on the run for long.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.368
We need some hard evidence.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:23.957
Lee?

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.135
You kept a copy?

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:40.640
I was supposed to give it to a friend of
mine, a reporter at the Washington Herald.

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:42.600
-She asked me-- -Claire Isaacs?

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:45.645
How'd you know?

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:49.816
Lee, she's dead.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:51.276
They killed her.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:54.946
No way they could have known about her.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.532
-I didn't tell anyone. -I know.
It's not your fault.

01:07:57.699 --> 01:08:00.368
They probably tapped her phone.
There's many ways--

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:06.582
-Everything's gonna be all right, okay?
-I was just trying to cover myself.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.585
I didn't know who I could trust.

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:12.672
-Now I'm gonna get us both killed. -No.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.466
This may be the only thing
that keeps us alive.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:18.553
-I don't even know what's on that.
-We have to find out.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:22.307
I've tried. It's completely hacker-proof.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.685
There's no way to run it outside Cyrez.

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:28.354
Then we run it from the inside.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:33.192
John, that place is like a fortress. We
can't go back there. They'd expect that.

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:38.363
-I'd hate to disappoint them. MAN: John.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:43.319
The streets are clear. The police returned
to the safety of their doughnut shops.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:46.747
-Lee, this is Father Rodriguez. -Hi.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:48.082
Pleasure.

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:50.501
Of course, I was not
always Father Rodriguez.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.880
Could say I was born again, with
a little help from our friend.

01:08:54.421 --> 01:08:58.843
Some of his Colombian associates wanted
to introduce him to God personally.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.220
I've been given a second chance at life.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:04.057
This time, I'm using it to do God's work.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.975
Is there anything else I can do?

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.435
We need a car, just for a day or two.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:13.399
Done. It burns as much oil as
it does gas, but it's yours.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.492
Are you sure about this?

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:25.745
There's no one else I can trust.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.874
JOHN: Hello, Johnny.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:15.628
-You! -I need to talk to you right away.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:21.884
I got one question for you.

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.971
Was it your idea to hook me up
with the Village People here?

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:26.848
Well, you're safe, aren't you?

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.559
Well, from the Mob, yeah.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:33.688
I mean, no self-respecting wiseguy would
be caught dead in a joint like this.

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:36.482
Oh, look, do me just one favor.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.785
Don't-- Don't let on
that I'm straight, okay?

01:10:38.798 --> 01:10:40.945
I don't wanna break any
hearts or nothing.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:44.907
Trust me. Remember when you told me if I
ever need anything, I could come to you?

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.118
-Yes. -Well, I need your help.

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:49.829
Well, wait a minute. You need my help?

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:52.790
Right now.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.834
You got it. Kevin?

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.670
Cover me for a few seconds.
I'm gonna help a friend.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:00.131
Who's he? He looks rough.

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:01.841
Please don't start.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:04.510
Maybe you two need a moment alone?

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.346
We're fine, thank you.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.265
Just an idea.

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:11.851
Kevin just worries about me.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.896
Don't ask.

01:11:18.232 --> 01:11:20.985
You want me to help you break into Cyrez?

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:23.362
-Yeah. -What, are you shitting me?

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:26.199
I thought you wanted help to
move a sofa or something.

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:28.451
Pull over up ahead.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.204
Look, I'm gonna help you out.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:35.124
All we're gonna need is some tanks,
a couple of rocket launchers...

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:39.253
...and a set of balls
like the king of Bayonne.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:40.546
JOHN: All you need are these.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:46.135
I'll meet you back at his place.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:52.725
What, I look like I got gas or something?

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:18.167
-Gentlemen. -You wanna
tell me what's going on?

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.616
I'll have the situation
contained in 24 hours.

01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:22.588
Not good enough.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:25.967
We have problems. They're solvable.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:28.719
-We have to cancel the shipment.
-That's not an option.

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:33.182
What do we do with 10 tons of assault
weaponry that's not supposed to exist, huh?

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:36.060
I am the eyes and ears of
your world, gentlemen...

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:39.313
-...and there's too much heat.
HARPER: You don't get it, do you?

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.566
The money has changed hands.

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:45.361
These are not the kind
of people you cancel on!

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:53.327
Get those guns out of the country
tonight or you're a dead man.

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:56.080
Now...

01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:58.624
...how do you intend to
contain the situation?

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.711
Kruger has to show up at Cyrez.
When he does, I'll be waiting.

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.254
Well, why would he risk that?

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:07.300
He needs to know what's on that disk.
That's the only thing that'll clear them.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.510
Fine. This better work.

01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:12.430
The disk, the girl, the guns.

01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:14.890
By dawn, they don't exist. Are we clear?

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:18.561
Yeah, crystal.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:22.398
The House Armed Services Committee
announced that two weeks from today...

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:25.818
...it will begin official
hearings into the Cyrez scandal.

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:27.987
-Sources tell us the
committee-- MAN: Perfect.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:31.657
The place is crawling with reporters.
We've gotta keep a lid on this mess.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.190
Do what I tell you, and
by tomorrow you'll be

01:13:34.203 --> 01:13:36.579
chuckling about this
in your country club.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:39.832
-Now, who's running this game room? -I am.

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:43.711
-This is James Haggerty,
head of security. -Good.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:47.673
We're gonna keep everything
nice and low-profile.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.718
-You ever do any wetwork? -Only
on three different continents.

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:54.305
Yeah. Well, you wanna impress
me, Slick, do your fucking job.

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:56.015
How many people can you bring in?

01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:59.310
Twelve experienced professionals.
They'll do whatever it takes.

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:03.189
Plus 20 more on the security force.
They'll follow orders.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:04.607
Well, that's fine.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:08.486
My man is at the main entrance. Make
sure he receives your full cooperation.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:12.198
He's dialed in. We've got every possible
point of entry under surveillance...

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:15.701
-...from the rooftop to the sewer system.
JOHN: Well, this fucker's a ghost.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.538
Believe me. If he wants in, he'll get in.
Where's he gotta go to run this disk?

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:22.583
The central vault. No other
terminal can access that program.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:26.712
If he wants to read the disk,
there's only one way in.

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.840
That's outstanding, gentlemen.

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:34.178
I guess all we gotta do is sit back and
wait for Mr. Kruger to come to us.

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.895
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where do
you think you're going?

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:46.315
Take it easy there. I got a
delivery for Blevens, 14th floor.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.567
We can't accept any
unauthorized deliveries.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.945
"We can't accept any deliveries."

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:53.155
I'm just messing with you, man. Why not...

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:57.785
...call Blevens, get him to authorize it?
I got a pepperoni and cheese here.

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.329
GUARD: Maybe you don't understand.
-Who's that?

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.248
This is a high-security facility.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:07.336
Maybe you don't understand, my friend.
This is a Papa Genoche's pizza, okay?

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:11.549
If Blevens doesn't get it while it's hot,
he gets two for free, out of my pocket.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:13.676
-I'm trying to save. -Search him.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.928
Get your hands off me!

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:21.267
Hey, listen, I got a bad heart and
a very good lawyer, all right?

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:23.102
Shut up.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:24.520
He's clean.

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:28.649
Cheese and pepperoni.

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:36.032
All right, pal, hit the road.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:38.951
I said, hit the road.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.743
-What's the hell's going
on down there? -Some

01:15:50.756 --> 01:15:53.007
pizza-delivery guy
is having a seizure.

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:54.675
Which moron ordered a pizza?

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:56.978
This is all we need. Get
him to the infirmary

01:15:56.991 --> 01:15:59.138
immediately and
call an ambulance.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.858
Out of the way! Coming through!

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:21.952
-Yeah? DEGUERIN: How we doing?

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.621
We'll be on the road in an hour.

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:25.998
They need to be rolling
or I need to know why.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:27.500
Yes, sir.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:30.169
All right, come on, guys. Let's move it!

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.758
They've been expecting you.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.052
Infirmary is straight
through the loading dock.

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:40.763
-Is the patient stable? -I'm not sure.
Better hurry.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.223
Thank you.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:01.659
WOMAN: All right, he looks stable.
Give him some low O2.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.419
JOHNNY: Hey. It's all right.
-He's fibrillating! Code blue!

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:14.130
No--

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.553
WOMAN: Give me some gel.

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:24.223
-No! No! No! -Clear!

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:30.271
Right this way. They're waiting for you.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.023
Here we go again. Clear!

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.903
All right, increase the voltage.

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:41.532
Let's do it one more time.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.743
-Let's not. -Oh, my God.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:47.496
You, over there, against the wall.

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:48.956
Get down on the floor.

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:51.166
Face the wall.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.503
-Get on the floor. -Oh, my God, terrorists!

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.589
You want terror? Yeah, huh?

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:59.341
You want some freaking terror?
You want some terror?

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.761
-Get your ass up here, I'll jump-start it!
-Here, tape them up.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:04.179
Okay, face the wall.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.599
There.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:09.393
Keep the room secure.

01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:12.897
-You think you can handle that?
-Get out of here.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.902
Let's go.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.285
We got a problem.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.621
What? What is it?

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:31.123
-He's running the disk. -Shit!

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.458
That's impossible.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:36.045
-Station 1, any activity at your location?
-All clear.

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:39.715
All clear, my ass. He's in,
he just didn't use the door.

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.134
Come on, get your men down there now.
Let's go!

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:00.486
What?

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.992
-What are you doing? -No, I know this.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:11.038
-We change it every week. -Screw that.
Get out of the way.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.042
Go ahead, check it.

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:33.894
Somebody talk to me.

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:37.898
He must be running the disk from a remote
terminal somewhere in the building.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.611
-You said he couldn't do that. -He can't.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:45.489
-Donahue designed it so no
outside ac-- -Donahue--

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:47.533
Donahue is dead.

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:51.954
And you're gonna wish you were too
unless you find out what is going on...

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:53.998
...and you find out now.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:56.292
-Holster your weapon. -Take a hike, junior.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:59.294
I said, holster your--

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:05.497
You know, some people
take things for

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:07.845
granted, like the ability
to chew solid food.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.763
I can find him.

01:20:11.849 --> 01:20:12.891
How?

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:16.311
I can scan the terminals and I
can eliminate them one by one.

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:19.023
If he stays online, I'll nail him.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.482
Then do it.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.070
LEE: How we doing? -You
were right about Donahue.

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:27.406
He left himself a back door.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:30.200
But we still have to break his code.

01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:36.290
I figure we've got another five or
six minutes until they trace us.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.461
-Do you recognize any of this? LEE: No.

01:20:40.627 --> 01:20:43.088
But we're getting warm.
It's an accounting format.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:45.758
Okay. Stop me if I get lucky.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:51.472
-How we doing? -Eliminating
low-clearance programs.

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:54.516
Okay, south wing is clean. Two more to go.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.478
I've got two federal investigators
downstairs who wanna talk.

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:01.440
Fine, go talk. Do what you
gotta do, but get rid of them.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:04.610
-You can't be seen here.
-I won't be. Just go.

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:10.157
-I need a chopper on the
roof ready to go. -Right.

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.285
Those are offshore banking deposits.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.288
"UBS." That's United Bank of Syria.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:18.290
Fifty-two million dollars.

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.960
If it's an arms sale, it's a major one.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:24.213
Let's see who their buyer is.

01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:30.677
[LEE READS ON-SCREEN TEXT]

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:33.263
-Who's that? -Bad news.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.934
He heads a cartel in the Russian Mafia...

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:40.896
...selling drugs, guns, influence
to some very unpleasant people.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.612
-He's somewhere in the north wing.
-North wing. Get moving.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:50.531
Let's go.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:52.825
-How much longer? -I don't know.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:56.036
There's 15 terminals running
secure programs in there.

01:21:57.871 --> 01:22:00.791
You got five minutes. You
find them, you call me.

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.334
Let's go.

01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:07.339
There it is. "Delivery date:

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:08.924
Tonight, midnight."

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:11.385
A thousand units for delivery
at Baltimore Harbor.

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:13.053
A thousand units of what?

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:19.309
An E.M. gun.

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:22.521
A thousand E.M. guns.

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:26.525
Are they insane? If these
things get offshore....

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:29.862
There will be a whole new
era of world terrorism.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:37.786
Got him. Twenty-fifth
floor, Donahue's office.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:40.747
Scramble. Alpha chief
to the north wing, now!

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.543
They're on to us.

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:48.046
They're erasing the goddamn disk.

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:28.253
Come on.

01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:43.519
-I'll cover you. Meet me at the ambulance.
-No, I can't--

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:44.895
Go!

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.367
Lee, run!

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:13.590
You listen up, John! We're
playing my rules now!

01:24:14.758 --> 01:24:18.929
You mess with me and I'll slice her up and
mail her back to you in little pieces.

01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:35.904
COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Fire alert. Fire alert.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.242
This is not a drill. Please
proceed to the nearest exit.

01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:15.861
In this car, I can get us
to Baltimore in 40 minutes.

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:18.238
Johnny, you're not coming with me.

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:20.073
-I'm gonna drop you off. -No.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.534
Please don't give me this
"I work alone" shit.

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:25.912
You've already done enough.
This is not your fight.

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:29.708
Look, no. Look, just-- Just
indulge me for a minute, okay?

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:31.752
If it weren't for you...

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:36.381
...my tongue would be hanging on Canelli's
trophy wall like a freaking trout.

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:39.301
Now, look, you need me.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.429
My cousin Tony runs those docks.

01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:45.557
If your ship is there, he will find it.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:13.919
-You're short one envelope here.
-Infantino didn't pay.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:16.254
What do you mean, he didn't pay?

01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:17.672
What'd he say?

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.592
He said, "Tell that fat
fuck, Tony Two-Toes...

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:22.761
...I ain't gonna pay him another dime."

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.472
I know that voice...

01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:27.599
...but it can't be him.

01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:31.103
Not unless he's a ghost.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:35.941
Boo.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.860
Johnny C.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.320
I thought you got whacked!

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:43.532
-It must have been some other guy. -Yeah?

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:46.284
Some other guy rat out Canelli too?

01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:48.328
Hey, Canelli's a piece of shit.

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:51.248
I got no love for Canelli either.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:54.000
But this time--

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.296
This time you went over the line, John.

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:01.216
I'm still here.

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:03.844
What you did was wrong.

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:07.472
What he did got a drug dealer
and his poison off the streets.

01:27:09.516 --> 01:27:10.934
Who's the tree trunk?

01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:14.396
This is the guy that saved my ass.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:16.773
That's my cousin, Tony Two-Toes.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.483
That's Sallie boy.

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:21.027
And that's Little Mike.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:23.613
Your funeral was absolutely beautiful, man.

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:26.658
Listen, Canelli finds out
he's still breathing--

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:30.203
Screw Canelli. We got bigger
problems than that. Tell him.

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:32.164
There's a major arms deal going down.

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:36.042
A U.S. contractor's selling out
to international terrorists.

01:27:41.548 --> 01:27:45.010
Mr. 60 Minutes. Tell me
something I don't know.

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:47.888
It's going to happen tonight on your docks.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.434
That I didn't know.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:27:59.900
Quite a lot of security.

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:02.027
Expecting trouble?

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:06.031
-I'm a Boy Scout. Always be prepared.
-Is that why you brought her?

01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:10.452
DEGUERIN: No. Just think of
her as an insurance policy...

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:13.497
...you know, in case
someone crashes the party.

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:15.415
Something you're not telling me?

01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:19.002
DEGUERIN: Just a little bump in the carpet.
Nothing for you to worry about.

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:22.964
Relax, Sergei. You'll be
out of here in 20 minutes.

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:25.300
What do I do with her?

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:27.928
Whatever you want.

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:31.014
Once you're in international
waters, her policy expires.

01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:32.557
Personally...

01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:36.186
...I'd put a bullet in her
head and throw her overboard.

01:28:38.063 --> 01:28:39.564
It would be such a shame.

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:41.900
Don't even think about it.

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:49.574
I think what I like and I do what I like.
You will soon learn about this.

01:28:51.243 --> 01:28:52.869
Last crate's on its way.

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.623
I'll leave you two lovebirds alone.

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:01.503
DeGuerin.

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:13.640
This is Kruger. Get me Beller.

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:17.602
-Start a trace on this. MAN: Yes, sir.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:22.566
-John? -I've got the proof.

01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:25.235
Cyrez is selling weapons
on the black market.

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:26.778
Daniel Harper's in on it.

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:29.197
Undersecretary of Defense Harper?

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:31.783
Yes. DeGuerin is their facilitator.

01:29:32.117 --> 01:29:34.327
He is the mole. It all goes down tonight.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:37.414
Come and get me. Baltimore docks.

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:39.708
Pier 57.

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:42.460
BELLER: John? John?

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:04.232
E.M.T., report.

01:30:05.025 --> 01:30:06.401
Range is clear.

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:07.944
Not a creature is stirring.

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:14.659
MAN: Clear on the south.

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:17.829
Quiet on the east.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:20.707
All right, gentlemen, listen up.
This is the last load.

01:30:20.874 --> 01:30:23.501
Keep your heads up and
your assholes puckered.

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:25.795
That son of a bitch is
out there, I want him.

01:30:31.134 --> 01:30:33.011
JOHNNY: Hey, sunshine. Whoa.

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:34.888
Give me a sec, I wanna talk to you.

01:30:35.055 --> 01:30:37.098
This is a restricted area.

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:41.186
You're telling me. Let me ask you,
what the hell are you doing here?

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:44.731
-Excuse me? -We're from
the Local 129, sonny.

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:49.861
We heard you was loading a ship without
the assistance of bona fide union labor.

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:51.363
Say it ain't so.

01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:55.617
-Sir, we have a situation here.
-You certainly do.

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:58.244
Stand by. We're coming to you.

01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:09.547
-What the hell is going on here? -Let
me explain something to you, sonny.

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:14.094
Nothing moves off these docks without
it don't get loaded by the union.

01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:18.181
And I don't see no union
people around here. Do you?

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.463
Gentlemen, this is a matter
of national security.

01:31:20.476 --> 01:31:22.560
Clear this area immediately.

01:31:22.852 --> 01:31:26.648
-Are you threatening us? -Absolutely.

01:31:40.203 --> 01:31:42.872
-What the hell was that? -We
got gunfire at the warehouse!

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:52.090
Nobody screws with the union.

01:31:58.096 --> 01:32:01.433
Perimeter, check in. If someone's
there, talk to me, goddamn it!

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:03.226
We have a security breach.

01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:05.562
Well, check it out. Get
that crane on the move!

01:33:00.867 --> 01:33:03.745
I've got movement, southwest
corner of the warehouse.

01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:07.248
It's nothing.

01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.174
TONY: There they are.

01:33:16.341 --> 01:33:17.550
Commie bastards.

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:19.594
Actually, they're not Communists anymore.

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:22.722
They're a federation of
independent, liberated states.

01:33:22.889 --> 01:33:25.225
-Don't make me hurt you, Mikey.
JOHNNY: Quiet.

01:33:25.391 --> 01:33:27.519
Keep your eyes on those guys on that crane.

01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:29.854
Think I can hit that guy from here?

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:36.361
Give it a rest, Sal. You're lucky if
you hit the floor if you fell on it.

01:33:41.616 --> 01:33:44.661
-Got him. Thirty yards out.
-Fry the bastard.

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:54.003
Jesus Christ.

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.109
Fuck me.

01:34:18.736 --> 01:34:19.821
DEGUERIN: Okay.

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:24.158
-I think it's safe to say we got him.
-He's toast.

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:29.122
-I think we even got the roaches. -Yeah.
Royce, Somes, you're recon.

01:34:29.289 --> 01:34:30.790
Bring me back the good news.

01:34:30.957 --> 01:34:33.251
E.M. team, you cover them.

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:35.211
Roger.

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:08.286
JOHN: Come on, goddamn it.

01:35:39.776 --> 01:35:41.527
Nice shotgun, asshole.

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:43.988
No!

01:35:47.825 --> 01:35:48.910
Royce?

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.668
Schiff! Calderon!

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:24.589
They missed.

01:37:27.925 --> 01:37:31.304
-Johnny? -I'll be right out.

01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:35.391
Open fire!

01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:53.034
It looks as if your friend has arrived.

01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:54.911
I'll enjoy introducing him to you.

01:37:55.078 --> 01:37:59.791
I doubt I'll have the pleasure. He has
forced me to hasten our departure.

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.168
And yours.

01:39:25.251 --> 01:39:26.544
Goddamn it!

01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:28.838
Now you are pissing me off!

01:39:30.882 --> 01:39:32.008
Drop the guns.

01:39:34.844 --> 01:39:36.471
Do it now.

01:39:45.855 --> 01:39:47.231
Thanks.

01:39:47.857 --> 01:39:49.442
-John! -Shut up!

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:53.112
Take it up! Let's go, now!

01:42:01.741 --> 01:42:04.327
JOHN: Here. Grab the ladder.

01:42:10.249 --> 01:42:11.876
Hold on.

01:42:12.501 --> 01:42:14.503
Say goodbye, John.

01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:19.508
Goodbye.

01:43:02.759 --> 01:43:06.222
DEGUERIN: John! John, buddy!

01:43:06.639 --> 01:43:09.266
John! Don't let me go like this, man.

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:12.895
John, help me. John.

01:43:28.577 --> 01:43:29.662
Son of a bitch!

01:43:32.998 --> 01:43:34.708
MAN: Drop the gun!

01:44:10.619 --> 01:44:13.289
-All right, get him out of here! -Yes, sir.

01:44:24.049 --> 01:44:25.509
Thank you, John.

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:33.934
MAN 1: Ready? Let's go!
MAN 2: You got that end?

01:44:34.435 --> 01:44:36.103
Come on!

01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:38.731
John!

01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:06.124
MAN 1: Mr. Undersecretary,
Mr. Undersecretary.

01:45:06.174 --> 01:45:07.258
MAN 2: Mr. Undersecretary.

01:45:07.426 --> 01:45:09.354
How does it feel to be
indicted for treason?

01:45:09.367 --> 01:45:11.305
We have nothing to
say at this time.

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:14.725
Marshal DeGuerin. Marshal
DeGuerin, what about you?

01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:17.728
-I'm proud of what I've done.
-You admit to treason?

01:45:17.895 --> 01:45:20.147
I admit to patriotism.

01:45:20.606 --> 01:45:22.566
Our actions stopped a secret alliance...

01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:26.987
...that this administration has had with
some of our nation's worst enemies.

01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:31.242
The public deserves to know the truth.
When we have our day in court, they will.

01:45:31.408 --> 01:45:33.536
-That's all. MAN 3: Yes, sir.
What is your response--?

01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:38.040
They could get away with this?

01:45:38.207 --> 01:45:40.501
If Morehart takes the fall.

01:45:43.295 --> 01:45:44.672
You did well in there.

01:45:46.465 --> 01:45:49.009
I couldn't have done it
without you watching over me.

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.055
Are you ready?

01:45:53.597 --> 01:45:55.222
Yeah.

01:46:01.313 --> 01:46:03.649
Pretty impressive speech.

01:46:03.816 --> 01:46:07.486
You ought to learn to keep your
mouth shut in front of the press.

01:46:07.653 --> 01:46:09.863
DEGUERIN: It doesn't matter anyway.

01:46:11.657 --> 01:46:14.952
This'll never go to trial
without her testimony.

01:47:09.173 --> 01:47:10.663
-I'm not so convinced
we should start again.

01:47:10.676 --> 01:47:12.176
DEGUERIN: Why not?

01:47:12.468 --> 01:47:16.013
With this bitch gone, we can
spin-doctor ourselves clean.

01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:19.391
What about people she's been in contact
with, her friends, her family?

01:47:19.558 --> 01:47:23.979
Fuck her family, fuck her friends.
I'll kill them one by one.

01:47:24.146 --> 01:47:28.275
-By next year, she won't even be a memory.
-Robert, you never fail to amaze me.

01:47:28.734 --> 01:47:30.861
Me? Thank you.

01:47:31.028 --> 01:47:33.614
But you-- I gotta hand
it to you, Danny boy.

01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:36.909
That was a brilliant piece
of work you did back there.

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:39.870
-What are you talking about? -The van.

01:47:40.037 --> 01:47:42.581
It was beautiful. I mean,
it was clean, it was swift.

01:47:42.748 --> 01:47:45.626
You got hundreds of witnesses
to say we were never near it.

01:47:45.834 --> 01:47:49.546
I like your style. You
know, you remind me of me.

01:47:49.713 --> 01:47:52.925
-Wait a minute, I thought you set that up.
-What? Didn't you--?

01:47:55.427 --> 01:47:57.054
What the hell's going on up there?

01:47:59.056 --> 01:48:00.808
-What the hell's going--? -What is it?

01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:10.985
Hey.

01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:17.533
Hello?

01:48:21.036 --> 01:48:22.454
It's for you.

01:48:27.459 --> 01:48:30.170
-Yeah? JOHN: You've just been erased.

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:45.352
HARPER: Oh, my God! DEGUERIN: Holy shit.

01:48:46.103 --> 01:48:48.689
-Let me out of here! I don't wanna die!
-Break it!

01:48:48.856 --> 01:48:49.982
Get the hell off of me!

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:22.931
What happened?

01:49:27.269 --> 01:49:29.396
They caught a train.

01:49:30.305 --> 01:49:36.641
