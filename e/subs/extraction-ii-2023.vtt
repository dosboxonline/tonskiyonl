WEBVTT

02:51.583 --> 02:53.583
We've done everything we can.

02:54.791 --> 02:57.375
It would be wise to consider a threshold.

03:06.791 --> 03:08.750
Sis... it's not fair to leave him like this.

03:17.416 --> 03:19.208
I'm not giving up on him.

06:12.541 --> 06:13.458
Zurab.

06:20.416 --> 06:22.833
I just heard from the prison.

06:26.833 --> 06:29.958
They're extending your brother's
prison sentence by ten years.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.000
Governor.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.875
Zurab. Always wonderful to see you.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.625
How are you, my friend?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.250
I've been better.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.208
One of our prize bulls is sick.

07:27.208 --> 07:29.208
We have to kill him.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.083
Bury him before he infects the others.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.208
You asked me here to commiserate?

07:35.208 --> 07:37.041
Walk with me, would you?

07:43.041 --> 07:45.833
You said it was urgent.

07:47.291 --> 07:49.833
I just heard that this morning
you signed off on

07:49.833 --> 07:52.916
extending my brother's prison sentence
by ten years.

07:53.250 --> 07:57.583
Your brother threw a DEA agent off a roof.

07:58.833 --> 08:01.166
The Americans are all over us.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.458
When Davit and I were young,

08:05.958 --> 08:09.500
I was to protect my brother at all costs.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.541
My father would never let me forget it.

08:13.333 --> 08:17.333
I contested his extradition to the States.

08:18.041 --> 08:20.166
Kept him in a Georgian prison.

08:20.166 --> 08:24.750
I even allowed his family
to be housed in prison with him.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.250
Let's not forget who put you
in this office. And why.

08:30.416 --> 08:33.375
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

08:35.541 --> 08:40.083
One of our prize bulls is sick.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.333
You told me.

13:47.416 --> 13:50.500
Don't wake them.
It's hard for them to fall asleep in here.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.125
Come.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.458
No.

13:55.083 --> 13:55.958
No?

13:56.958 --> 13:58.125
Not tonight.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.916
It's been weeks
since they've seen the sun.

14:02.416 --> 14:06.083
They can't survive like this.
It's hard on them.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.375
Hard?

14:08.666 --> 14:10.208
He needs to grow up hard.

14:10.208 --> 14:12.333
There are other places to hide.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.833
Sure, in here your brother protects us.

14:14.833 --> 14:17.500
But I don't want my son
to become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

14:17.833 --> 14:20.041
The last thing I need is your fat mouth.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.583
What are you going to do?

14:22.375 --> 14:24.333
Drag me into your cell?

14:25.333 --> 14:27.041
You forgetting you're my wife?

14:27.041 --> 14:29.375
Not your property.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.166
Maybe I raise them on my own, huh?

14:34.208 --> 14:35.916
You would not be missed.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.041
Mom, you okay?

15:07.541 --> 15:09.750
I thought you were sleeping.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.125
Are you sure you are okay?

15:22.625 --> 15:23.750
I'm fine.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.000
I'm sorry.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.458
It's okay, my love.

15:34.416 --> 15:36.750
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.125
Maybe Dad is right.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.791
I do need to grow up hard.

15:46.541 --> 15:48.375
So I can become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

20:22.250 --> 20:24.666
We can get a shipment of weapons
to Seoul by tomorrow night.

20:24.666 --> 20:27.875
And my brother Yaz
will fly there to deliver it personally.

20:28.791 --> 20:30.708
I have tickets to the game tomorrow.

20:35.250 --> 20:37.166
Sorry, I have to call you back.

21:21.541 --> 21:22.916
You're going to miss the game.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.666
Fucking hell.

22:57.833 --> 23:00.708
- You're already edgy.
- But I need to talk about it.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.750
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

23:19.583 --> 23:20.791
Freezing out there.

23:21.291 --> 23:22.666
They don't want to sleep in the cold,

23:22.666 --> 23:24.666
they shouldn't kill people for a living.

23:59.625 --> 24:00.958
207 unlocked.

24:01.458 --> 24:02.791
You got five minutes.

24:30.458 --> 24:33.000
Power is out everywhere.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.791
Going to check it out.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.958
Sandro, wake up. We have to go.

25:10.958 --> 25:12.125
Get dressed.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.708
Who is this man?

25:15.708 --> 25:17.666
He's going to take us out of here.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.375
Put your shoes on.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.791
Where are we going?

25:31.583 --> 25:33.208
I'll tell you later.

25:40.708 --> 25:41.708
Dad?

25:43.583 --> 25:45.375
This man is getting us out of here.

25:45.375 --> 25:47.333
Your father's waiting outside.

26:33.875 --> 26:37.208
<i>Code Red. Security, lock down the exits.</i>

26:41.583 --> 26:45.666
<i>Security breach. All guards, Code Red.</i>

26:47.916 --> 26:50.833
<i>Alert, perimeter breached.
Close down the exits.</i>

27:07.875 --> 27:11.000
<i>Alert, perimeter breached.
Close down the exits.</i>

29:09.708 --> 29:12.750
Don't be afraid.
Go up, and I'll come up too.

29:21.875 --> 29:24.083
Where are you taking my children?
Motherfucker!

29:31.625 --> 29:33.083
You bitch.

31:32.916 --> 31:35.833
<i>Alert, riot in the square.
Lock down the exits.</i>

31:38.750 --> 31:42.041
<i>Alert, riot in the square.
Lock down the exits.</i>

31:45.458 --> 31:48.875
<i>Alert, all units to the prison courtyard.
Close down all the exits.</i>

31:54.166 --> 31:57.875
<i>Code Red. Security, lock down the exits.</i>

32:27.916 --> 32:32.000
<i>Close all gates. Guards, get to the walls.</i>

36:41.166 --> 36:43.291
Where's Father? You told me he was coming.

36:43.291 --> 36:45.333
He'll meet us later.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.333
What do they know?

39:00.500 --> 39:03.541
- Why are Uncle's men shooting at us?
- Are you okay?

39:38.583 --> 39:39.958
Don't they know we're in this car?

41:34.541 --> 41:36.291
It hurts!

43:14.458 --> 43:15.625
Reaper Team, in position.

43:16.083 --> 43:17.208
Move, move.

43:26.833 --> 43:28.416
Reaper 1 and 2,
you have to stop this train.

43:28.916 --> 43:30.666
Copy, moving toward the engine.

43:33.375 --> 43:34.250
Go, go!

44:25.250 --> 44:26.583
Reaper 1 is down.

44:27.166 --> 44:28.041
Breaching!

47:14.416 --> 47:15.583
What's going on?

48:31.750 --> 48:32.791
I'm sorry.

48:35.208 --> 48:37.500
This was deeply resourced.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.791
Lead operative was A-plus.

48:40.333 --> 48:41.875
There's maybe four or five guys

48:41.875 --> 48:43.125
who could've done this to us.

48:43.541 --> 48:44.791
Was this the Chechens?

48:44.791 --> 48:46.666
It's not their style.

48:46.666 --> 48:48.666
They don't organize like this.

48:49.250 --> 48:50.791
Someone wanted revenge.

48:50.791 --> 48:53.375
With your brother, that's no short list.

48:54.416 --> 48:55.458
No.

48:57.208 --> 48:59.958
This wasn't revenge.

49:02.833 --> 49:05.041
This was something else.

49:37.125 --> 49:38.750
Where's Father?

49:38.750 --> 49:41.375
There isn't time for this.
Your sister needs help.

49:41.375 --> 49:42.708
I'm not leaving without him.

49:42.708 --> 49:45.125
- Come on. Your sister needs help.
- I'm not going.

49:45.708 --> 49:47.625
Your father isn't coming.

49:50.833 --> 49:52.125
Is he dead?

50:09.333 --> 50:10.500
Please, Sandro.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.250
Davit!

51:35.541 --> 51:36.458
I tried to protect him.

51:36.458 --> 51:38.250
Is this protection?

51:40.416 --> 51:43.750
You fight for your brother
till your last drop of blood.

52:06.916 --> 52:08.916
Full medical detail.

52:09.750 --> 52:11.416
I need you to meet us
at Donau-City Strasse.

52:43.666 --> 52:45.666
Calm down. She's just trying to help.

52:45.666 --> 52:47.083
Don't patronize me.

52:47.458 --> 52:49.750
A doctor will be there when we land.
Try to rest.

53:19.416 --> 53:21.125
You are a brave girl.

54:24.750 --> 54:25.875
I'm listening.

54:26.500 --> 54:28.958
Uncle... It's me, Sandro.

54:29.291 --> 54:31.041
Sandro? Where are you?

54:32.791 --> 54:34.875
Was my father going to kill my mother?

54:37.291 --> 54:38.125
Sandro--

54:38.125 --> 54:39.333
Answer me!

54:41.750 --> 54:44.000
Don't listen to anything your mother says,
you understand me?

54:45.375 --> 54:46.833
She did this.

54:47.875 --> 54:50.375
She had your father killed. Understand?

54:52.583 --> 54:55.583
She has wanted to take you away
from your father for years.

54:57.208 --> 55:00.000
<i>And now you are with the man
who killed him.</i>

55:01.625 --> 55:02.791
<i>So where are you?</i>

55:06.375 --> 55:08.291
You're a <i>Nagazi.</i> Be your father's son.

55:10.166 --> 55:12.083
Where are you heading?

55:15.666 --> 55:17.583
<i>Where are you heading?</i>

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.291
This is the most important thing
I will ever ask you to do.

01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:35.583
To rectify this desecration.

01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:39.750
This filth came to our home
and murdered our family.

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.458
Our brothers.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.000
By God's law, he must die by our hand.

01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:50.875
You are my brothers. My life is yours.

01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:54.416
I'll follow you to the end.

01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:56.666
My life is yours.

01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:58.250
And mine.

01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:20.875
You're throwing their lives away.

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:23.416
This path doesn't end well.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.083
"You fight for your brother
till your last drop of blood."

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.416
I haven't forgotten my father's lesson.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:36.458
Have you?

01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:18.750
Up or down?

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.875
They'll come down. More options.

01:05:22.083 --> 01:05:23.166
The children?

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:30.666
"Meet me in the back alley."

01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:41.708
What did you do?

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.333
I'm sorry, Mama...

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:46.208
Sandro... What did you do? How could you?!

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:48.666
He doesn't care about you!

01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:51.333
He's gonna kill us!

01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:53.666
The <i>Nagazi</i> are my family.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.666
I am your family.

01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:07.291
Nina is your family!

01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:27.416
We need backup!

01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:15.541
Come, boy.

01:09:19.458 --> 01:09:20.583
Don't listen to him.

01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:26.291
Come back to us.

01:09:31.875 --> 01:09:33.083
Come to your family.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.291
It wasn't my mother's fault.

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.541
She just wanted us to get out of there.

01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:17.000
Get in the car, stay here!

01:10:19.291 --> 01:10:20.333
Watch the boy.

01:11:44.291 --> 01:11:45.833
Team three, take them out.

01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:47.250
Quick.

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.125
They're up top.

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:11.375
Force them back into the building.

01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:42.916
<i>Pin him in!</i>

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:09.458
Commander, do we have permission
to engage?

01:13:09.458 --> 01:13:11.041
Shooters on the roof.

01:13:11.208 --> 01:13:12.500
<i>Cleared to engage.</i>

01:13:13.833 --> 01:13:15.125
<i>Police!</i>

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:16.333
Reload!

01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:27.458
- Team one, they're headed to you.
- We're ready.

01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:34.250
Sergo, Konstantine, secure the entrance.
Everyone else, up top.

01:15:47.458 --> 01:15:48.416
You okay?

01:15:49.958 --> 01:15:51.333
You're gonna be okay.

01:15:53.875 --> 01:15:54.875
I am sorry.

01:15:56.541 --> 01:15:58.541
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.750
Is he going to kill my mother?

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:23.208
If you wanted her alive,

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:25.625
you shouldn't have called.

01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:14.458
Traitor!

01:25:17.583 --> 01:25:18.541
What happened?

01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:10.500
I thought I would never see you again.

01:28:42.416 --> 01:28:44.000
The whole country is looking for us.

01:28:46.125 --> 01:28:47.958
Then go, get on the plane.

01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:57.958
We lost ten <i>Nagazi</i> today.

01:28:58.208 --> 01:28:59.916
Good soldiers.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.541
It's enough.

01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:03.000
Don't be afraid.

01:29:03.916 --> 01:29:04.875
It'll be fine.

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:11.958
Be an example to Sandro.

01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:14.916
You're no good to him dead,

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:16.791
or rotting in an Austrian prison.

01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:19.666
How can I be an example to Sandro,

01:29:19.666 --> 01:29:21.583
if I run away?

01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:24.250
Let's ask God.

01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:37.708
"Fear not, for I'm with you."

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.250
"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted."

01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:43.625
I know, I've read it.

01:29:45.791 --> 01:29:47.791
I once believed God took your hearing,

01:29:48.125 --> 01:29:52.958
so he could whisper right into your ear.

01:29:55.041 --> 01:29:57.000
But now you only hear your rage.

01:29:58.458 --> 01:30:00.666
You know who my father
used to compare you to?

01:30:01.416 --> 01:30:03.666
Do you remember the cricket
from the movie?

01:30:03.666 --> 01:30:05.750
The one who sits on the boy's nose.

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:07.666
Always chirping nonsense in his ear.

01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:09.833
Chirping and chirping, again and again.

01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:11.833
Do you remember it?

01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:15.291
And where is your father now?

01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:19.833
Where is your brother?

01:30:40.291 --> 01:30:42.458
I always knew
there was a bullet waiting for me,

01:30:43.833 --> 01:30:47.416
but not from your gun.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.166
Sweetheart.

01:31:15.958 --> 01:31:17.416
You got so big.

01:31:19.791 --> 01:31:22.333
Aunt Mia's going to take us
somewhere safe. Okay?

01:31:23.333 --> 01:31:24.958
Is Sandro coming?

01:36:55.208 --> 01:36:56.083
Hurry up.

01:38:54.416 --> 01:38:55.875
Go. Take his gun.

01:38:58.791 --> 01:39:00.583
Don't make me tell you again.

01:39:51.666 --> 01:39:53.333
I said to point the gun at him.

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:07.208
This is the man who killed your father.

01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:10.333
Avenge him.

01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:28.166
Pull the trigger.

01:41:03.291 --> 01:41:04.500
Disappointing.

01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:37.083
I'm going to blow his asshole face off.

01:44:46.166 --> 01:44:47.166
I will not...

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:48.833
stop.
