Are you here to steal?

Don't underestimate me.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.800
you would have died once.

It's my horse.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.820
Why isn't it with you?

55:37.610 --> 55:38.380
With me,

55:38.410 --> 55:39.440
it can't run.

55:39.960 --> 55:40.960
It'll be a shame.

55:42.410 --> 55:43.660
It's the best horse.

55:50.390 --> 55:51.600
It likes you.

55:52.190 --> 56:03.360
So much of our lives, we
haven’t seen each other.

56:04.480 --> 56:14.600
Moving as two different stars.

56:16.620 --> 56:27.500

56:52.670 --> 57:03.000
in a meal that’s freshly
cooked and mixed with yellow grain.

57:04.470 --> 57:13.340
Tomorrow we part across the mountains.

57:16.320 --> 57:25.320
And life and the world
are boundless and obscure.

From the night rain, spring chives (chun jiu) are cut in a meal
that’s freshly cooked and mixed with yellow grain (huang liang).

57:29.770 --> 57:32.750
Tomorrow we part across the mountains, and
life and the world are boundless and obscure.

57:32.750 --> 57:35.090
Do you know what these mean?

57:38.830 --> 57:39.830
Chun jiu...

57:39.830 --> 57:40.860
is spring wine.

57:41.320 --> 57:42.640
Huang liang...

57:42.640 --> 57:43.820
His Majesty's food.

57:49.970 --> 57:51.180
Silang is so fast.

57:51.210 --> 57:53.910
I feel like the wind when I'm on its back.

57:54.760 --> 57:57.560
That's how birds feel
when they're flying, right?

57:58.280 --> 57:59.490
I think so.

58:01.400 --> 58:03.400
This is my first time riding a horse.

58:03.700 --> 58:05.950
When was your first time?

58:06.500 --> 58:08.420
I grew up on horse backs.

58:10.160 --> 58:11.330
In Chang'an?

58:11.840 --> 58:12.630
Yes.

58:14.590 --> 58:16.250
What does Chang'an look like?

58:17.740 --> 58:19.070
Chang'an is big.

58:20.850 --> 58:23.410
There is a market in front of my house.

58:24.130 --> 58:26.370
I go there every day.

58:27.170 --> 58:29.470
On the right, there's a naan shop

58:29.580 --> 58:30.910
and a bun shop.

58:31.700 --> 58:33.700
On the left, a rice wine store,

58:34.190 --> 58:35.530
a pepper store,

58:36.660 --> 58:38.740
a butcher's, a fishmonger's.

58:39.460 --> 58:41.660
On the west street is the Huaniao Market

58:41.810 --> 58:43.810
that sells silk, colorful fabrics,

58:44.200 --> 58:45.360
and huqin.

59:04.330 --> 59:05.650
Zhang Xiaoyu.

59:11.070 --> 59:13.000
I want to go back to Chang'an.

59:14.120 --> 59:15.200
After I get my revenge,

59:15.200 --> 59:16.610
we'll go together.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.240
How did you know?

59:43.710 --> 59:45.710
She's the person we're looking for.

59:47.990 --> 59:50.740
I found the person who
drew the wanted poster

59:51.530 --> 59:52.660
and identified him.

59:54.780 --> 59:56.440
This is the kid.

59:58.450 --> 59:59.700
How much is she worth?

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.610
You look familiar.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:03.370
We've met before.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.060
At Fengbei Tower.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:08.960
Why were you there?

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.400
Why did you draw that poster?

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.510
Were you there that night too?

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:20.490
You want revenge, right?

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:28.770
What's your relationship
with that blind man?

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.540
Why did he help you?

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:34.870
He didn't help me.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.780
So you do want revenge.

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:55.540
Hey.

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:01.730
Zhang Xiaoyu.

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:49.780
Don't move!

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.740
Put down the knife.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.000
Hurry up!

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:04.560
Strangle her to death then.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:19.610
Let's go.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.600
Where are we going?

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.740
To kill someone.

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:28.830
I promised you.

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.100
Don't kill him.

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:35.320
He's not my enemy.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.110
What do you think revenge is?

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.380
A few more innocent dead,

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:43.920
and a few more living
people who want revenge.

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.080
That's the cost.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:47.060
What about you?

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:49.960
What are you going to do?

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.910
I've already paid the price.

01:03:58.690 --> 01:03:59.990
I've asked around.

01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:03.210
There's a team of horses
leaving town in the morning.

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:04.700
Go with them.

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.950
You could use a little help on the road.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:08.480
Okay.

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.030
You left in a hurry.

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:11.360
I scraped the bottom,

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.490
that's all there is.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:15.040
Your cold isn't a strange disease.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.880
You can buy this
medicine from the Persians.

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:28.280
In Chang'an,

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.430
don't rush to buy a house.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.320
Rent a few places

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:35.780
and then choose a suitable one.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.300
It's enough.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.990
If you hear anything in a few days,

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.840
just pretend you don't know.

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.250
Is it for that child?

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:53.140
It's for me.

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:57.030
If you go back,

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:59.650
you won't be able to be
a bounty hunter anymore.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.100
Be an ordinary person then.

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:05.750
An ordinary person?

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.250
You wish.

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.240
I've already paid the price.

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:52.130
I don't want to.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.950
Let him go.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.620
Next question.

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.580
What's the color in front of you?

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.500
Black.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.820
Has it always been black?

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.370
It was red at first.

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:30.790
Then the dust

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:32.140
turned it black.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.210
Is there no light at all?

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:36.870
Yes.

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:38.950
Not at all.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.120
I'll give you one eye.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.650
One is enough for me.

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.370
Do you want the left or the right?

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:50.180
What's the difference?

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.240
There's a difference.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.440
My left eye is bigger.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.890
Why did you leave your hometown?

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:04.690
Because I don't have a family.

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:05.910
Where did they go?

01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:07.740
They died.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.630
How did you get here?

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.990
Ask me next time.

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.720
We have to set off tomorrow.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.500
Pack up.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.490
Let's go.

01:07:58.090 --> 01:07:59.010
Zhang Xiaoyu!

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.120
Where is the kid?

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:04.010
Where did she go?

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.780
The child.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.760
The one who was with me.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.690
Zhang Xiaoyu!

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.040
You can't even see a child.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.500
Are you more blind than me?

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:12.150
Zhang Xiaoyu!

01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:14.820
Zhang Xiaoyu!

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.990
Hey.

01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:19.109
The kid left.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.180
He left last night.

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:21.740
Where did he go?

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.569
It's been a while.

01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:23.540
He went back.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.710
He went back to Youzhou.

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:25.640
How did he leave?

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.939
I prepared a good horse for him

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:30.800
and sent him back with
the best rider I could find.

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.870
A cart can't compare to a fast horse.

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:40.620
Sir,

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:42.439
even if we work this horse to the bone,

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.910
we can't get to Youzhou before dark.

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:00.040
Stop.

01:09:08.609 --> 01:09:09.750
Silang!

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:18.580
Silang!

01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:07.150
How long have they been gone?

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:22.170
How many of us are there?

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:23.710
Not less than 300.

01:10:25.450 --> 01:10:27.450
Come with me out of town before dawn.

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:30.200
I'll catch them myself.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.940
I heard that a child

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.490
has been trying to kill me.

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:31.900
It's you, right?

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.020
You're amazing.

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:54.100
Unfortunately, you're not lucky.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.040
Didn't you say a blind
man has been helping you?

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.240
Why isn't he here?

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.450
It must be fun to play with him.

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:15.050
Lieutenant won't care
about someone like you.

01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:17.630
Really?

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.320
What kind of person am I?

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:23.090
What kind of person is he?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.120
What's your relationship with him?

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.030
Why

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:32.200
don't you play with me?

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:36.930
You're going to die.

01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:38.570
Are you afraid?

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:51.170
After you're dead,

01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:53.940
I'll dig your eyes out

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.950
and stuff them into his sockets.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.490
Then he'll be able to see.

01:12:57.490 --> 01:12:58.450
Bullshit!

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.370
Then, I'll kill him.

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:04.920
You can be reunited then.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.460
I'm not afraid of you.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.120
I'm not afraid!

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.030
Don't come.

01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:37.990
Don't come.

01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.870
Don't come.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.860
Bullshit!

01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:45.530
Weren't you going to Chang'an?

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.300
What's the difference

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.570
if you don't go?

01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:55.890
Are you hurt?

01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.300
Speak.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.660
Hold tight.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.070
Behind you.

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:39.200
I'm happy

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:40.990
you came to play.

01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:49.050
But I've had enough fun.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.980
Lieutenant.

01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:05.110
[Interesting]

01:23:10.710 --> 01:23:12.180
Zhang Xiaoyu.

01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:15.370
What you said before...

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:18.880
does it still count?

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.100
I...

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.410
I'll avenge you.

01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:27.690
Change places with me.

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:28.760
Yes.

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:31.940
I've avenged your death.

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:36.320
Go home for me.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.950
Bullshit!

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.600
My name is Zhang Xiaoyu.

01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.740
Yu refers to a fish in two pools of water.

01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:02.230
I don't know if two pools of water

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.810
will make the fish's life better.

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:06.830
But 153 days after

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:09.240
I met Lieutenant,

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.260
I lost him.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.200
Chang'an is really big.

01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:45.860
There's a market at the
entrance of where I live.

01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:48.120
♫ Where are the great men of the past ♫

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:49.140
It nine cents for 10 pieces of naan.

01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:51.930
♫ And where are those of future years? ♫

01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:52.340
One liang of rice wine costs 3.5 cents.

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:54.870
14 cents for one catty of meat.

01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:56.760
♫ The sky and earth forever last ♫

01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:58.390
A carp costs 50 cents.

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.020
♫ Here and now I alone shed tears ♫

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.230
I want to tell him

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:03.140
the fish is delicious.

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:05.430
♫ At that time ♫

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.920
The meat is much cheaper than in Youzhou.

01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:09.480
♫ Why were you sad ♫

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.460
The day lilies are blooming.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.710
It always rains in the morning.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.970
♫ When I think of it again ♫

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:13.080
I think

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:16.080
I'm becoming more and more
like an ordinary person.

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:18.150
♫ I smile and all is clear ♫

01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:51.160
Keep it.

01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:53.920
Really?
