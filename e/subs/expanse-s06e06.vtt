WEBVTT

00:08.217 --> 00:10.302
My new coordination protocol

00:10.302 --> 00:12.763
returned a coherent
reply pattern.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.641
I feel weird.
What happened?

00:15.641 --> 00:19.353
You got hurt,
like, killed hurt.

00:19.353 --> 00:23.357
I'm going to stay here
with Joseph on Ceres.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.109
Anytime anyone
goes through a Ring,

00:25.109 --> 00:27.403
they don't realize
they're taking a massive risk.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.617
Inaros can rain hell

00:33.617 --> 00:35.453
on any point
inside the Ring Space.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.662
We need to load up

00:36.662 --> 00:38.205
every warship
we've got right now.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.624
Do you truly believe
the odds are in our favor?

00:40.624 --> 00:42.460
They have size,
we have numbers.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.669
No matter what they do now,

00:43.669 --> 00:45.463
they can't engage us
everywhere at once.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.214
We need Drummer's strength.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.008
It's really that bad?

00:49.008 --> 00:50.551
We have lost more ships
than we could afford.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.094
I despise Marco.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.971
Avasarala and her Inners
are no better.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.347
That was true once.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.892
The system is filled
with the graves of Belters

00:57.892 --> 00:59.435
who trusted Inners.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.312
My people will not
take orders from you.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.522
I don't expect them to.

01:37.348 --> 01:39.183
Cara, baby.
- Ow!

01:39.183 --> 01:40.976
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.937
You can't do that,
just run off.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.230
I'm okay.
You scared the hell

01:44.230 --> 01:45.731
- out of us.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.107
What did you do with Xan?
Why would you do that?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.275
You have to tell us
where he is, baby.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.443
It's not right
to leave him out there.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.861
I'm sorry!

01:50.861 --> 01:54.031
I didn't know how long
it was gonna take to fix him.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.950
Fix him?

01:57.076 --> 01:58.911
The dogs fixed him.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.913
Dogs? What are
you talking about?

02:00.913 --> 02:03.415
Where is your brother?

02:13.259 --> 02:15.010
I want a hug, too.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.763
- It's okay, he's fine.
- No.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.390
Stay behind me!

02:19.390 --> 02:21.308
Get out, whatever the hell
you are, get out of here!

02:21.308 --> 02:23.185
Stop it,
It's Xan, stop!

02:23.185 --> 02:24.895
No, baby, it's not Xan.
It can't be.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.814
You brother's gone.
He's gone.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.023
No!
- Daddy?

02:28.023 --> 02:30.109
Ahh!
Stop, no!

02:40.995 --> 02:42.329
No!

02:42.329 --> 02:44.206
Daddy...

02:49.336 --> 02:51.714
I'm calling the soldiers.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.844
Cara?
Cara!

02:56.844 --> 02:58.637
Cara where are you?

03:00.055 --> 03:03.434
Cara, Cara, Cara!

03:03.434 --> 03:05.436
Cara, Cara!

03:05.436 --> 03:07.271
Mommy, Daddy!
Cara!

03:07.271 --> 03:08.522
Over here!
Mommy, Daddy!

03:08.522 --> 03:09.899
Just keep talking!
We're almost there!

03:09.899 --> 03:11.775
Baby, we're coming!
We're gonna find you!

03:15.946 --> 03:19.116
They're scared of me.
- I know, I'm sorry.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.535
Xan, the soldiers are coming.
We have to go, we have to go!

03:21.535 --> 03:23.162
Come on.

03:23.162 --> 03:26.248
Mommy, Daddy, I'm over here!

03:26.248 --> 03:27.958
Mommy, Daddy!

03:40.012 --> 03:42.222
There's nothing
you can eat out here.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.683
You'll die.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.610
It's okay.
If I die, the dogs will fix me.

04:16.548 --> 04:19.218
Free Navy is using
standard evasion tactics

04:19.218 --> 04:22.596
to try to disguise their
numbers and drive signatures.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.015
But it's clear
that they are forming up

04:25.015 --> 04:27.977
into three major battle groups
en route to the Ring.

04:27.977 --> 04:30.521
They know we're gonna engage
with them at some point.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.773
So they're trying
to split up our forces,

04:32.773 --> 04:35.401
reduce our torpedo advantage
head-to-head.

04:35.401 --> 04:37.778
Marco Inaros
doesn't want to slug it out.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.738
He just needs to get past us.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.449
Given the engagement
of the UNN, MCRN,

04:42.449 --> 04:44.118
and friendly Belter assets,

04:44.118 --> 04:46.412
the best opportunity
to stop them will be here,

04:46.412 --> 04:49.039
here and here...

04:49.039 --> 04:51.041
all of our combined forces

04:51.041 --> 04:52.751
against virtually
all of theirs.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.130
Massing battleships
is a numbers game

04:56.130 --> 04:58.465
since the Age of Sail.

04:58.465 --> 05:03.429
These numbers are too evenly
matched for my comfort.

05:03.429 --> 05:06.015
Hard to believe the Inner fleets
have been reduced to this.

05:06.015 --> 05:08.350
I'm sure you and your faction
did their part.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.437
Not recently,
but things can change quickly.

05:11.437 --> 05:12.855
It's this kind of bullshit

05:12.855 --> 05:16.191
that has left all of us
with fewer ships.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.027
The strength
of the Free Navy warships

05:18.027 --> 05:21.196
is concentrated
in these two groups.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.074
UNN and MCRN fleets
will take on those.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.369
This group consists primarily
of tenders and supply vessels

05:27.369 --> 05:29.079
with a smaller gunship escort.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.706
Your ships should be able
to handle them.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.041
Don't worry about us.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.417
We will do
what needs to be done.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.127
I like it.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.838
Enough with all the hit and run
guerilla war crap.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.090
This time Inaros is gonna
have to stand and fight,

05:40.090 --> 05:42.760
and we're gonna put an end
to it once and for all.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.219
And if we don't,

05:44.219 --> 05:46.889
the Free Navy will cruise
through the Ring.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.433
Marco will hunker down
on Medina station

05:49.433 --> 05:51.310
behind his railguns

05:51.310 --> 05:55.105
in control of our colonies
and a thousand systems,

05:55.105 --> 05:58.901
dictating the fate of
our species for a generation.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.612
Which is why we have a plan B.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.864
While the combined fleet
moves into position

06:03.864 --> 06:05.491
to engage the Free Navy,

06:05.491 --> 06:08.869
the Roci will be
on a hard burn to get here.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.746
We will rendezvous
with an old ice hauler,

06:10.746 --> 06:13.165
the Giambattista,
which will be transporting

06:13.165 --> 06:14.541
a heavily armed assault team.

06:14.541 --> 06:18.253
- To assault what?
- The Ring Station.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.214
We're gonna capture
Marco's railguns.

06:20.214 --> 06:24.093
Those guns have shredded
half a dozen MCRN gunships

06:24.093 --> 06:25.469
in a matter of seconds.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.346
The strike team
was taken by surprise.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.473
They didn't know that
the railguns were there.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.433
We've come up with a way
to distract those guns

06:31.433 --> 06:33.685
and make ourselves
a much harder target.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.895
We'll get to that
in a minute.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.522
It's quite ingenious
actually.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.315
Would make a Belter proud.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.067
Thank you.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.819
The MCRN strike team
destroyed the Free Navy ships

06:41.819 --> 06:43.070
guarding the Ring,

06:43.070 --> 06:45.197
so there'll be no resistance
on our way in.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.533
While the Rocinante takes out
Medina Station's

06:47.533 --> 06:50.661
targeting and comm arrays,
the assault team will land

06:50.661 --> 06:52.162
on the surface
of the Ring Station

06:52.162 --> 06:54.456
under the minimum firing limit
of the railguns.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.959
We'll take the control bunker,
turn the guns on Medina,

06:56.959 --> 06:58.502
and force them to surrender.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.004
And if any Free Navy ships
get past the main fleet action

07:01.004 --> 07:02.798
and come through the Ring
behind us,

07:02.798 --> 07:06.802
we'll use their own guns
to blow them straight to hell.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.804
Is this the best
you could come up with?

07:08.804 --> 07:10.430
Madam,
I know the Ring Space

07:10.430 --> 07:12.641
and that station better
than anyone.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.560
We'll get it done.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.521
You're such
a fucking optimist.

07:17.521 --> 07:21.233
It's a miracle
you have lived this long.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.449
Reporting for duty
as ordered.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.284
Take your station.

08:56.328 --> 09:01.166
On Medina, they say Drummer
always kiss the Inners' boot.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.918
Welwalla finally gonya get

09:02.918 --> 09:05.003
what she deserve then, keya?

09:05.003 --> 09:06.964
We will rewrite
the history book.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.806
- Something wrong?
- Why would it be?

09:15.806 --> 09:17.766
I convinced your father
to reinstate you

09:17.766 --> 09:20.894
because I believe he's better
with you at his side.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.981
Even though he'd never admit it,
he needs you.

09:23.981 --> 09:27.776
And we all need to be able
to count on you.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.237
- Can we?
- Of course.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.155
Monitor the situation,
but no open comms.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.700
Aye, Captain.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.163
Good.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.754
I told you they would
split their forces.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.965
You still don't like the odds.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.508
Not my kind of fight.

09:51.508 --> 09:55.971
This battle was inevitable
sooner or later.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.890
I'd have preferred later
after a clean run to Medina

09:58.890 --> 10:01.310
and us safely behind
those big Laconian guns.

10:01.310 --> 10:04.313
And who knows what else?

10:05.814 --> 10:09.818
You're expecting something
more from Duarte?

10:09.818 --> 10:12.321
Well, you know how much
I like surprises.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.769
- Full load.
- Thanks.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.902
That thing can really
hold all this?

10:51.902 --> 10:53.862
Hell yeah.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.831
- Problem?
- No.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.501
You know, a lot
of Martians still consider

11:07.501 --> 11:10.045
the Rocinante a stolen ship.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.130
They insist
on calling it the Tachi.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.424
Must have driven Alex crazy.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.634
It did.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.928
He'd tell people
that the ship wasn't stolen.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.471
It was just smart.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.723
And went looking for people
worthy enough to fly it.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.063
When we're done
with this business,

11:28.063 --> 11:29.981
I'm gonna tell
that story a lot.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.282
Sorry.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.994
Why don't you
go get some rest?

11:42.994 --> 11:44.746
We're all gonna need it.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.208
As soon as we're ship-shape
and secure, I will.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.293
I promise.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.635
I'm gonna go restock
the fast-patch kits.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.845
Clarissa.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.182
Can you do me a favor?

12:04.182 --> 12:05.642
Sure.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.060
The juice injectors in ops

12:07.060 --> 12:08.770
haven't been flushed
and reset for a while.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.106
I know a visual check's
standard, but considering...

12:11.106 --> 12:13.483
I can take care of that.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.319
- Okay to do it now?
- Yeah, patch kits can wait.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.238
Thanks, boss.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.994
The injectors
are my responsibility.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.288
You know that.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.248
Do you remember the first
time you called me boss?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.709
- No.
- It was halfway through

12:30.709 --> 12:32.961
my first run on the Cant.
You'd been there longer.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.005
I thought you were
fucking with me,

12:35.005 --> 12:36.548
- putting me in my place.
- You were the engineer.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.549
I was a mechanic.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.218
- You were the boss.
- Yeah.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.724
After a while...

12:45.724 --> 12:48.059
it meant more than that.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.271
That's true.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.983
Clarissa calls you boss now.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.903
I think she means it
in the same way.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.933
What's all this?

14:11.935 --> 14:15.021
It's been a while since any
of us had a home cooked meal.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.149
I thought I'd give it a try.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.859
I'll set the table.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.779
What smells so good?
What do we have here?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.614
Textured mushroom
seco de carne

14:24.614 --> 14:28.243
with soy tequeños on the side,
our chef's specialty...

14:28.243 --> 14:31.246
Can I get...all right.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.582
Of course,
he had the real stuff.

14:33.582 --> 14:34.958
Don't get your hopes up.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.085
I can always whip up
some red kibble in a pinch.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.546
Oh God, please don't.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.756
I'm hungry,
I'm not that hungry.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.760
- Yum.
- Not ready yet.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.095
You need a hand, Clarissa?

14:47.095 --> 14:48.597
You're gonna grab
with your hand? Get a spoon.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.056
Hang on.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.686
She's trying to wash
the blood off her hands.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.979
Can I try it now?

14:55.979 --> 14:58.356
That's what I wanted
for Filip.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.568
Ooh, it's hot.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.903
And I didn't wanna
give her a chance.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
I'm glad you did.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.831
I'm going down
to the Ring Station

15:14.831 --> 15:18.084
with the ground assault.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.753
You can't.

15:19.753 --> 15:23.632
The ship can't go into battle
without a mechanic.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.508
Ship's got one.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.182
Look, it's gonna be
a shitstorm down there,

15:32.182 --> 15:34.768
and if I'm gonna get myself
offed for the cause, fine.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.311
Better reason than most.

15:36.311 --> 15:37.937
I just prefer
to be looking the guy

15:37.937 --> 15:41.316
who's gonna punch my ticket
straight in the fucking eye.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.614
You know,
for someone who says

15:47.614 --> 15:50.492
they don't wanna be a hero...

15:53.578 --> 15:56.373
You sure end up
being one a lot.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.338
Tequeños?

16:03.338 --> 16:05.423
This is good.
- Thank you.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.510
Not too much salt?
Mm-mm.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.972
He can get his own pot.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.058
Ha.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.385
Madam Secretary
General, CIC.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.638
The drive sigs the Rocinante
got for us paid off.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.015
We've located the Pella.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.396
I'm on my way.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.791
Combined fleet flash.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.210
UNN battle group one
has located the Pella

17:24.210 --> 17:26.337
and will engage.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.623
Oye, Bosmang,
Inyalowda just report

18:01.623 --> 18:04.000
they ID the Pella in
main Free Navy battle group.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.586
I heard.
- If they kill Marco without us

18:06.586 --> 18:08.797
you think maybe they
try to cut us out later?

18:08.797 --> 18:10.381
That remains to be seen.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.551
They have their targets.
We have ours.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.095
The frigate is the main threat.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.848
If we kill it first, we can
make the rest surrender or run.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.683
Oh, we not the freighter run.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.143
A fat prize.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.979
If we cannot kill
Marco ourselves,

18:24.979 --> 18:27.357
happy to take what is his.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.240
Torpedoes are away.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.429
You look nervous.

18:58.429 --> 19:01.224
I am nervous, ma'am,
for you.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.725
We're in a forward position.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.477
I'd feel much better
if our secretary general

19:04.477 --> 19:05.854
were safely in the rear guard.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.856
- I'm sure that...
- I need to be close enough

19:07.856 --> 19:11.359
to maintain real-time
communication with the fleet.

19:11.359 --> 19:15.196
If certain orders need to be
given, I will give them myself.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.586
I wish we had
more assets on our flank.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.879
It was disappointing
that more Belters

19:30.879 --> 19:32.338
didn't rally to the cause,

19:32.338 --> 19:34.382
especially after all you did
for them on Ceres.

19:34.382 --> 19:38.636
What we did was too little
and too late,

19:38.636 --> 19:42.724
the sad story of our species.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.143
I want to
capture the freighter intact.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.395
Concentrate all fire
on the frigate.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.731
All ships acknowledge.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.444
Fire!

20:08.708 --> 20:10.752
Captain,
freighter is breaking up.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.421
Pashang.
All ships, this is Drummer.

20:13.421 --> 20:16.090
Whoever is targeting
the freighter, disengage.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.217
Concentrate all fire
on the frigate.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.852
Direct hit on Pella.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.900
The Pella's hurt.
They're falling back.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.944
Must have damaged
their reactor.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.746
The other ships aren't
falling back to protect it.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.920
It's not even returning fire.

20:55.838 --> 20:59.676
I don't think Marco Inaros
is on that ship.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.014
Captain, all ships report,

21:05.014 --> 21:06.933
no one is fighting
at the freighter.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.267
Copy, all missile systems.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.436
Target is locked.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.566
Checking,
one, two, three, checking.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.819
All targeting systems green.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.737
Stand by for firing.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.739
It isn't a freighter.
Standing by.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.713
Hull plates away.

21:39.590 --> 21:40.758
Fire!

21:48.891 --> 21:50.727
All ships,
counter batteries, fire!

21:56.524 --> 21:58.818
Cut thrust.
Broadside to incoming!

21:58.818 --> 22:00.945
All guns free-fire!

22:07.076 --> 22:09.954
Captain, we've got the...

22:17.336 --> 22:19.714
Drusilla here, still alive.

22:19.714 --> 22:22.300
But our missile ran dry.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.802
Khandahar here also.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.889
Torpedo down.
All we can do is fly.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.399
Report.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.777
Drive intact, reactor failing.

22:40.777 --> 22:44.363
Going into shutdown.
All torpedo gone.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.115
- The others?
- Four ships lost.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.450
No power to five.

22:47.450 --> 22:48.951
Khandahar and Drusilla
are operational

22:48.951 --> 22:50.870
but also no torpedoes.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.538
Pella is underway again.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.791
Resuming original course
for the Ring.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.251
All ships, this is Drummer.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.545
Disengage, collect survivors,

22:59.545 --> 23:02.673
and rejoin the fleet
if you can.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.967
Leave the Pella to me.

23:08.179 --> 23:09.889
A collision course? Captain...

23:09.889 --> 23:11.432
We can still catch it.

23:11.432 --> 23:12.850
Reactor will overload.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.977
That will help.

23:22.777 --> 23:25.696
Oye, bosmang.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.491
Think we think the same.

23:28.491 --> 23:31.911
Just beat you to it.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.413
Tenye wa chesh gut.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.982
Damage amidships.
Hull breach on deck four.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.567
Got a problem in reactor!

24:02.567 --> 24:03.860
We're losing drive three!

24:03.860 --> 24:06.571
Balance thrusters!
Kill drives three and one!

24:06.571 --> 24:08.906
On it, I'll shut down
drive three and drive...

24:19.333 --> 24:21.878
She needs a medic
and a patch kit.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.130
Is it bad?
Am I hit?

24:27.508 --> 24:30.219
I don't wanna go.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.805
She needs help!

24:46.235 --> 24:47.778
All combined fleet elements,

24:47.778 --> 24:50.573
UNN SIGINT reports the Pella
may be flying disguised.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.909
Be on the lookout
for atypical hull profiles

24:52.909 --> 24:55.745
and unusual drive signatures
and approach with caution.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.121
Ship status.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.248
Reactor on low but stable.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.001
We can still limp.
Tightbeam Fleet.

25:02.001 --> 25:05.796
Apprise them of our situation
and set a rendezvous.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.299
We've done all we can.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.803
Tenye wa chesh gut, Rocinante.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.528
Cooper, ready.

25:30.613 --> 25:33.407
Gates, ready.

25:33.407 --> 25:34.867
Rogan, ready.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.827
Stone, ready.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.957
Hudson, ready.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.166
Burton, ready.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.501
How you feeling, brother?

25:43.501 --> 25:45.753
Like I'm trapped
in a portable toilet.

25:45.753 --> 25:48.506
Try not to dwell on that.
You'll pee in your suit.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.466
No one dies
with a full bladder.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.677
I'll be adjusting your
evasive patterns on the fly

25:52.677 --> 25:54.595
depending on
what those railguns do.

25:54.595 --> 25:55.846
Same for the Roci.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.431
Gonna be a bumpy ride
for all us.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.767
Giambattista remote
nav link is solid.

25:59.767 --> 26:00.977
Drake, ready.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.104
Ring comm relay
ready for deploy.

26:03.104 --> 26:05.147
Ripley, ready.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.941
Star, ready.

26:06.941 --> 26:09.360
Assault team
is three zero green.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.778
Roci, we're ready to roll.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.572
Copy that.
All pods, stand by for launch.

26:16.367 --> 26:17.493
Good luck.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.537
You never say that
before a fight.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.539
- You say good hunting.
- Good hunting.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.212
Same to you all.
Rocinante out.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.665
Naomi's last sim said

27:04.665 --> 27:07.543
that the railguns should
only get about 20% of us.

27:07.543 --> 27:10.546
Those odds aren't terrible.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.340
A little worse
than Russian Roulette.

27:12.340 --> 27:15.301
What's that, a casino game?

27:15.301 --> 27:17.136
Kinda.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.424
The railguns are shifting
target to the pods.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.509
And us.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.891
I'll fly as close
to the periphery as I can.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.976
Make us as hard to target
as possible

28:05.976 --> 28:08.354
till I can put Medina between
us and those fucking guns.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.022
We're losing too many pods.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.149
Those railguns are
firing so goddamn fast.

28:12.149 --> 28:14.944
Assault team, stand by!
Setting evasion pattern to max.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.154
Everyone, pucker up.
It's about to get rough.

28:22.576 --> 28:23.661
Fuck.

28:26.497 --> 28:28.624
It's working.
The hit rate's going down.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.376
They're burning
reaction mass like crazy.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.961
The landing's gonna be brutal.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.463
At least we're giving them
a chance to land.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.971
Damage report!

28:45.349 --> 28:47.726
Goddamn, the new armor held.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.355
What the fuck?
We're losing power.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.317
I'm seeing
multiple faults in the grid!

28:55.317 --> 28:56.694
The reactor's trying to scram.

28:56.694 --> 28:58.154
Override, we can't slow down.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.613
If we don't,
we'll melt the core.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.157
If we slow down, we're dead.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.327
I'll fix it.

29:23.721 --> 29:26.307
We're stable
but still losing power.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.103
Ohh...

30:00.049 --> 30:02.968
A coolant pipe dislodged.
I have to reseat and patch it.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.345
There's tools
in the machine shop.

30:04.345 --> 30:06.347
There's no time for that.
We need more thrust now.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.277
I know what to do.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.867
Clarissa.

30:26.867 --> 30:27.952
Clarissa!

30:35.376 --> 30:37.795
Come on.

30:37.795 --> 30:39.713
Come on!

30:58.857 --> 31:01.860
Incoming fast movers
from Medina, spreading fast.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.654
They're going for the pods.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.823
Ready torpedoes
for counter battery.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.199
Ready PDCs.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.130
- Fuck.
- How many left?

31:21.130 --> 31:23.007
Enough to get the job done.

31:23.007 --> 31:25.217
Everybody ready to get
a little shorter?

31:25.217 --> 31:28.012
This one's gonna be 15 Gs.

31:33.267 --> 31:35.060
Ah, fuck.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.571
We're out of the railguns'
line of fire.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.615
Our turn, motherfuckers.

31:53.162 --> 31:55.581
Targeting and comm arrays
on Medina are out!

31:55.581 --> 31:57.124
Assault team,
you are clear to land!

31:57.124 --> 31:59.918
Clarissa's
not answering her comm.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.296
I'm going to the reactor.

32:13.057 --> 32:14.683
Clarissa!

32:14.683 --> 32:17.227
- I hurt my head.
- I thought you were gone.

32:19.271 --> 32:22.232
No such luck.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.109
I didn't use my mods.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.990
Just a ratchet strap
and some elbow grease.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.910
I'm gonna earn my keep.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.912
This was a good start.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.415
Aah!

32:40.167 --> 32:42.211
Aah!

32:54.765 --> 32:56.517
Aah!

32:58.644 --> 33:00.813
Aah!

33:51.822 --> 33:53.657
Move out.
You good?

33:54.575 --> 33:56.076
Yeah, I'm fucking good.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.537
All teams, sound off.
How many are left?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.456
Bravo team, five total.

34:00.456 --> 34:01.707
Charlie team, seven.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.125
Copy that.
Alpha team has six.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.544
Naomi's usually better
at the math than that.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.087
There's the reactor.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.756
Building next to it
is the control bunker.

34:08.756 --> 34:10.424
That is our objective.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.342
Incoming!

34:12.342 --> 34:15.179
- I'm out of range.
- Get to cover!

34:16.388 --> 34:19.808
Heavy weapons at the bunker,
at least two dozen contacts.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.269
At least four RPG launchers
and heavy machine guns.

34:22.269 --> 34:23.687
Go, go, go!

34:25.898 --> 34:27.649
Bravo, bring your team
in first.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.360
They're firing armor
piercing rounds.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.821
So use the walkway as cover
as you approach.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.532
Copy that, Alpha.
But Bravo cannot comply.

34:35.532 --> 34:38.076
We're taking heavy fire.
We can't advance.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.746
Fuck, Charlie,
do you have an approach?

34:40.746 --> 34:41.997
Charlie, report.

34:41.997 --> 34:43.457
Charlie's toast!

34:43.457 --> 34:46.251
RPGs pushed us out of cover.
Machine guns chopped us up.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.170
- There's only two of us left.
- Fuck.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.680
Can Bravo give us
any help at all?

34:58.680 --> 35:00.891
We've gotta get some
of this fire off our position.

35:00.891 --> 35:04.478
Bravo, we need to push.

35:04.478 --> 35:07.064
Eyes up!

35:12.986 --> 35:14.404
Move, move, move!

35:16.907 --> 35:18.700
Go, go, go!

35:18.700 --> 35:20.619
Go, go, go, go, go!

35:22.246 --> 35:24.665
Draper, clear!

35:24.665 --> 35:26.583
Rocinante, attack is stalled,

35:26.583 --> 35:29.044
and we are pinned down taking
heavy fire from the surface

35:29.044 --> 35:30.796
and from reinforcements
from Medina.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.130
We need air support!

35:32.130 --> 35:34.550
Negative.
We have to stay behind Medina.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.134
Those railguns
will be all over us

35:36.134 --> 35:37.386
the second
we stick our nose out.

35:37.386 --> 35:38.554
What about torpedoes?

35:38.554 --> 35:40.138
I can light them up
and guide them in.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.932
Too much danger of
impacting the surface.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.559
One plasma warhead
hits too close,

35:43.559 --> 35:44.643
and you'll all be dead, too.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.978
Jim, I'm back.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.729
We have to make a run
at the station.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.898
The assault team's
getting cut to pieces.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.777
I'll see what I can do
with countermeasures.

35:53.777 --> 35:56.446
Try to blind the railguns'
targeting systems...give me sec.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.241
- How's Clarissa?
- She made it.

35:59.241 --> 36:00.742
We're gonna need air support.

36:00.742 --> 36:03.245
They can't move until we
get of control those guns.

36:12.421 --> 36:16.758
Fuck it. I'd rather get shot
in the front than the back.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.969
Me too.

36:18.969 --> 36:21.013
Move, move!

36:23.181 --> 36:26.351
Okay, on me.
Wait for my mark.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.895
Then we go full speed
for the station!

36:27.895 --> 36:30.731
Spread as you go to draw...

36:30.731 --> 36:34.109
Draper!
What the fuck are you doing?

36:36.153 --> 36:40.115
All teams, fall back!

36:40.115 --> 36:42.576
Fuck that, all teams,
covering fire!

36:42.576 --> 36:44.828
Give them everything
we got left!

38:00.487 --> 38:03.281
Aah!

38:05.492 --> 38:08.245
Aah!

38:08.245 --> 38:10.497
I got you, Bobbie!

38:18.171 --> 38:20.465
Aah!

38:36.148 --> 38:38.025
Fuck yeah, Roci.

38:39.568 --> 38:44.197
No other choice.
Had to take out the guns.

38:46.533 --> 38:50.370
I'm sorry.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.832
We lost the guns.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.759
Marco Inaros,
in regard to your request

39:03.759 --> 39:07.387
for additional armaments,
your request is denied.

39:07.387 --> 39:10.807
Any further communications
will be refused, and any ships

39:10.807 --> 39:13.852
attempting to enter our space
will be destroyed.

39:13.852 --> 39:18.148
You were a useful distraction,
but I have gods to kill.

39:18.148 --> 39:21.568
The Ring to Laconia
is now closed.

39:21.568 --> 39:24.029
You're on your own.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.740
Oyedeng, Beltalowda.

39:33.497 --> 39:35.415
Come to apologize?

39:35.415 --> 39:37.667
Wise move now,
that victory is inevitable.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.753
Rosenfeld is dead.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.298
Too bad.

39:43.298 --> 39:46.093
She would have
governed Medina well.

39:46.093 --> 39:49.554
- She had a family.
- Yes, we were all her family.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.975
How do you do it?

39:53.975 --> 39:55.268
Do what?

39:55.268 --> 39:58.271
So easily cope with all
the people we've killed.

39:58.271 --> 40:00.232
There is nothing
to feel guilty about.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.943
Death for some is the price
of our freedom and our future.

40:02.943 --> 40:05.570
It could have easily been me
instead of Rosenfeld.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.614
Or me.

40:07.614 --> 40:10.075
None of us have a choice
in this.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.952
The greatest gift
any true Belter

40:11.952 --> 40:14.579
could wish for is to die
fighting for the cause.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.791
For the cause or for you?

40:17.791 --> 40:21.086
If it were you
and I lost you,

40:21.086 --> 40:25.132
I would lose a piece of myself.

40:25.132 --> 40:28.385
But I would accept my fate.

40:28.385 --> 40:31.221
And I would be proud, because
this is the life we've chosen.

40:31.221 --> 40:35.559
- When did I choose?
- You are my son.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.060
After all we've done,

40:37.060 --> 40:41.439
you still can't see

40:41.439 --> 40:44.234
what you've been given.

40:48.405 --> 40:50.198
I do now.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.711
I want the plan to repair and
restart the railgun reactors

41:02.711 --> 41:05.172
ready to go the moment
we recapture Medina.

41:05.172 --> 41:07.007
Aye, Captain.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.142
Beltalowda.

41:19.728 --> 41:23.565
We have reached the end.

41:23.565 --> 41:27.194
The end of the Inners'
hold upon us.

41:27.194 --> 41:30.530
Lift your heads,

41:30.530 --> 41:33.074
your eyes,

41:33.074 --> 41:38.663
your hearts, your spirits

41:38.663 --> 41:41.416
and know this.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.672
We have been bloodied,

41:47.672 --> 41:51.468
but they have been broken.

41:51.468 --> 41:57.432
And when we sweep through
the Ring one last time

41:57.432 --> 41:59.809
and sweep away the Rocinante

41:59.809 --> 42:04.981
and all vestiges of the Inners
from our space,

42:04.981 --> 42:10.111
when that moment comes,

42:10.111 --> 42:13.490
our long struggle

42:13.490 --> 42:17.327
will finally be over

42:17.327 --> 42:21.456
and our victory complete.

42:21.456 --> 42:25.085
We will rise

42:25.085 --> 42:30.006
from the ashes
of the Inners' failures

42:30.006 --> 42:33.802
and sow the seeds of
our humanity across the stars.

42:33.802 --> 42:36.763
This is the end,
the end of the Inners,

42:36.763 --> 42:41.268
and their end
will be our beginning.

42:44.521 --> 42:47.440
Beltalowda.

42:53.655 --> 42:56.199
Beltalowda, Beltalowda,

42:56.199 --> 43:00.495
Beltalowda,
Beltalowda,

43:00.495 --> 43:04.040
Beltalowda, Beltalowda,

43:04.040 --> 43:07.585
Beltalowda,
Beltalowda,

43:07.585 --> 43:12.966
Beltalowda, Beltalowda,
Beltalowda, Belt...

43:17.512 --> 43:19.431
Inaros will arrive at the Ring

43:19.431 --> 43:21.349
along with these ships.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.685
It's all that's left
of his fleet.

43:23.685 --> 43:26.604
But we have no assets in range
to intercept them.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.691
James, I'm sorry.
Godspeed.

43:29.691 --> 43:31.776
I'd say
we're outnumbered.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.486
So what's the plan?

43:33.486 --> 43:36.114
If we took the Roci down
to the Ring Station,

43:36.114 --> 43:39.117
could we use our reactor
to power up the railguns?

43:39.117 --> 43:41.578
If we had a couple
of weeks, maybe.

43:41.578 --> 43:44.080
We don't have a couple weeks.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.124
Then no.

43:48.001 --> 43:50.628
A lot of places we could go
before they get here.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.047
Just pick a Ring.

43:52.047 --> 43:53.923
We don't have enough fuel
or reaction mass

43:53.923 --> 43:55.300
to make it
to any of the colonies.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.760
Medina does.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.678
We've got half a dozen
patched-up soldiers in med bay.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.889
With me and him, that's
enough for an assault team.

44:00.889 --> 44:02.974
We'd have to hold a refueling
tank for the initial travel.

44:02.974 --> 44:05.310
Does anyone here
really wanna cut and run?

44:17.113 --> 44:20.658
What's left of the
Giambattista is still drivable.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.952
We send it back to the Ring,
set it to blow

44:22.952 --> 44:25.080
and they come through,
that'd take out a few of them.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.581
Maybe one or two more
with the debris.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.583
Bloody their nose at least.

44:28.583 --> 44:31.086
And then we just shoot it out
with the rest?

44:34.172 --> 44:37.842
We have three torpedoes,
PDCs are at 60%,

44:37.842 --> 44:40.804
enough railgun rounds
for a few good salvos.

44:40.804 --> 44:45.809
As long as we try
to kill Marco, I'm in.

44:45.809 --> 44:48.895
We are definitely
going to do that.

44:51.481 --> 44:54.317
Any of our passengers
wants out,

44:54.317 --> 44:55.860
all they have to do is say so.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.154
There's no shame in it.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.407
If we can get close,
I could try a breach-in entry.

45:00.407 --> 45:01.658
Take a ship out that way.

45:01.658 --> 45:03.159
Your suit is shot
to shit,

45:03.159 --> 45:04.828
so there's no way
you're gonna...

45:04.828 --> 45:07.080
The railgun is
our only real asset here.

45:09.707 --> 45:12.502
We might be able to trigger
the Ring Entities.

45:14.587 --> 45:16.589
When we came through the Ring
with the Giambattista,

45:16.589 --> 45:18.550
we lost some of the pods
to transit,

45:18.550 --> 45:21.052
which means we were
already close to the threshold.

45:21.052 --> 45:23.596
If we push every bit of mass
and energy we can

45:23.596 --> 45:26.599
through the Ring all at once,
every torpedo

45:26.599 --> 45:30.854
and railgun slug,
and we time it all just right,

45:30.854 --> 45:34.274
we should be able
to wake the Entities up.

45:34.274 --> 45:36.901
You said that
that would be bad.

45:36.901 --> 45:39.195
If we wake them up,
they might stay awake.

45:39.195 --> 45:43.867
This could put an end
to Marco once and for all.

47:37.939 --> 47:41.526
Veer off!

48:24.819 --> 48:26.321
Aah!

48:53.556 --> 48:56.976
War doesn't end
on the battlefield.

48:56.976 --> 49:00.480
It ends
at the negotiating table,

49:00.480 --> 49:02.440
or it doesn't end at all.

49:02.440 --> 49:06.653
We all agree we must control
traffic through the Rings.

49:06.653 --> 49:09.322
No one is opposed to the idea
of a transport union.

49:09.322 --> 49:11.282
Not even me.
Then why are we

49:11.282 --> 49:13.951
still sitting here?
The longer we dither,

49:13.951 --> 49:17.413
the more time we give
what's left of the Free Navy

49:17.413 --> 49:19.957
to gather themselves
and reorganize.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.709
We need to put something out.

49:21.709 --> 49:23.169
Put what out?

49:23.169 --> 49:27.298
A statement, our commitment
to collective action.

49:27.298 --> 49:30.593
The United Nations,
Mars, and the Belt

49:30.593 --> 49:32.595
have formed a new authority

49:32.595 --> 49:35.556
to administer trade
to the Ring colonies.

49:35.556 --> 49:39.310
Old enemies, new friends
are working together

49:39.310 --> 49:43.147
to ensure the entities
inside the Rings

49:43.147 --> 49:45.400
do not obliterate us all.

49:45.400 --> 49:46.818
Put this out.

49:46.818 --> 49:49.487
Belters will control the
traffic through the Ring Space.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.072
Oh God, here we go again.

49:51.072 --> 49:53.157
An authority with two Inner
votes and only one

49:53.157 --> 49:55.576
for the Belt isn't sharing
power...it's a puppet show.

49:55.576 --> 49:57.620
I take great offense to that.
You have no right...

49:57.620 --> 49:59.080
Prime minister.

50:03.084 --> 50:05.586
You need to be reasonable.

50:05.586 --> 50:07.922
I will not be reasoned
back into my place.

50:07.922 --> 50:10.049
Belters are promised a future

50:10.049 --> 50:12.343
so long as it remains
convenient.

50:12.343 --> 50:15.763
We are given a voice so long
as Inners control the comm.

50:15.763 --> 50:18.433
We have a vote so long
as we can always be voted down.

50:18.433 --> 50:20.309
Easy.
We're just talking here.

50:20.309 --> 50:22.854
Don't tell me to calm down.

50:22.854 --> 50:25.523
I'm tired of being talked at.

50:25.523 --> 50:29.360
You control a faction,
the most important one, yes,

50:29.360 --> 50:31.320
but you're not a government.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.656
Half of the stations
in the Belt

50:33.656 --> 50:36.409
and the Outer Planets
sided with Inaros.

50:36.409 --> 50:39.871
You cannot expect us
to reward them.

50:39.871 --> 50:44.876
What I expect is for you to
reward me and every last Belter

50:44.876 --> 50:47.545
who took up arms
against Inaros to help you.

50:47.545 --> 50:48.755
Mars will never accept

50:48.755 --> 50:50.006
Belter control
of the Ring colonies.

50:50.006 --> 50:51.299
The government would fall

50:51.299 --> 50:53.342
if I even proposed
the debate in Parliament.

50:53.342 --> 50:56.137
I give you my word
that you and your people

50:56.137 --> 50:57.680
will be represented.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.516
Equal status and dignity
to Mars and Earth.

51:00.516 --> 51:02.393
That promise has been
made and broken

51:02.435 --> 51:03.853
more times than I can count.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.147
Over and over we have been
told we can trust the Inners,

51:06.147 --> 51:08.733
that this time will be
different, and it never was.

51:08.733 --> 51:11.444
I cannot unwind history.

51:11.444 --> 51:14.071
The Belt will treat you
with respect.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.490
You have my word.

51:15.490 --> 51:18.242
We will take our niche in
the future and allow you yours.

51:18.242 --> 51:19.744
You have my word.

51:19.744 --> 51:22.747
Is that good enough?
Will you take that?

51:22.747 --> 51:28.711
Why is your word enough for me
and mine not enough for you?

51:28.711 --> 51:31.214
We're going around
in circles.

51:40.473 --> 51:42.350
Inaros wasn't all wrong.

51:45.978 --> 51:47.438
He was evil,

51:47.438 --> 51:50.233
and he was cruel, but he tapped
into something real.

51:50.233 --> 51:51.776
He was able to do what he did

51:51.776 --> 51:54.612
because so many people
were angry and frightened.

51:54.612 --> 51:57.114
They saw the future,
and they weren't in it.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.492
- That's what this has to fix.
- You agree with her.

51:59.492 --> 52:00.952
You wanna show someone
you trust them,

52:00.952 --> 52:02.286
you put your life
in their hands.

52:02.286 --> 52:04.121
You can't just pretend to.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.499
If you can't do that,
you don't really trust them.

52:06.499 --> 52:09.126
And if we can't find a way to
trust each other at this point,

52:09.126 --> 52:10.670
I doubt we ever will.

52:17.051 --> 52:22.348
What if this transport union
were an independent agency

52:22.348 --> 52:26.102
based in Medina Station, headed
by someone with no allegiances,

52:26.102 --> 52:28.145
a friend of the Belt.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.522
An Inner?

52:29.522 --> 52:32.316
It would have to be
a unanimous choice of Earth,

52:32.316 --> 52:34.735
Mars, and the Belt, of course.

52:34.735 --> 52:37.029
A person above reproach,

52:37.029 --> 52:40.241
apolitical, with a history

52:40.241 --> 52:44.495
of working honorably
with all sides.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.588
Wait a minute.
James.

52:53.588 --> 52:57.466
It's time for you
to make history again.

53:13.441 --> 53:16.944
I might be open to it
with certain assurances

53:16.944 --> 53:20.323
that would have to be
guaranteed in writing.

53:24.243 --> 53:26.329
More coffee.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.711
Finally,
and most importantly,

53:33.711 --> 53:37.298
the transport union
will be truly independent,

53:37.298 --> 53:40.676
not beholden
to any government or faction,

53:40.676 --> 53:43.429
its members compelled
by law to enforce

53:43.429 --> 53:45.222
and abide by its decisions.

53:45.222 --> 53:48.392
This union will allow us
to use the Rings safely

53:48.392 --> 53:50.436
and share
their benefits with all.

53:54.190 --> 53:56.067
I want to thank
the UN General Assembly

53:56.067 --> 53:58.444
and the Martian Parliament
for their vision, courage,

53:58.444 --> 54:02.323
and the speed with which
they ratified the charter.

54:02.323 --> 54:06.702
I'm proud and humbled
to accept this position

54:06.702 --> 54:09.872
as the first President
of the Transport Union.

54:12.416 --> 54:17.880
Before I agreed
to take this job,

54:17.880 --> 54:20.466
I insisted on a few conditions.

54:20.466 --> 54:23.344
One of them
was that Camina Drummer

54:23.344 --> 54:25.721
would be vice president.

54:25.721 --> 54:28.182
A very wise woman I know
once said you shouldn't believe

54:28.182 --> 54:31.060
what people say,
just watch what they do.

54:31.060 --> 54:33.813
My first official acts
will define not only me,

54:33.813 --> 54:36.315
but the transport union itself.

54:36.315 --> 54:39.777
This new union is gonna be
a critical part of our future,

54:39.777 --> 54:41.320
a future
that for the first time

54:41.320 --> 54:43.990
the Belt will truly share in.

54:43.990 --> 54:45.241
I'm not a Belter.

54:45.241 --> 54:46.867
I'm just a man from Earth,

54:46.867 --> 54:50.579
representing people I respect
and sometimes love.

54:52.039 --> 54:54.333
An outsider,
and I always will be

54:54.333 --> 54:56.043
and there's a problem
with that.

54:56.043 --> 54:57.628
Don't you fucking do it.

54:57.628 --> 55:01.257
Which is why,
as my first official act

55:01.257 --> 55:03.426
as President
of the Transport Union,

55:03.426 --> 55:05.136
I resign.

55:05.136 --> 55:07.930
The future of the Belt has
to speak with a Belter's voice,

55:07.930 --> 55:09.306
and in that spirit,

55:09.306 --> 55:11.183
I'm proud to introduce
the new President

55:11.183 --> 55:14.186
of the Transport Union,
Camina Drummer.

55:21.193 --> 55:25.865
One at a time, one at a time,
please, one at a time.

55:25.865 --> 55:27.908
You duplicitous little shit.

55:27.908 --> 55:29.201
It was the only way.

55:29.201 --> 55:30.578
The two of you planned this.

55:30.578 --> 55:31.746
We had to.

55:31.746 --> 55:34.123
You were negotiating
in bad faith.

55:34.123 --> 55:35.416
I will undo this.

55:35.416 --> 55:38.377
Don't.
Please don't even try.

55:38.377 --> 55:40.171
It was the only way
to secure the peace,

55:40.171 --> 55:42.840
the only way
we all move forward together.

55:42.840 --> 55:45.176
And you know it.

55:52.725 --> 55:57.855
Oh, James.
I hope you're right.

56:58.332 --> 57:02.628
Just take it easy.
Get the feel.

57:02.628 --> 57:04.505
The Roci's not the Razorback.

57:04.505 --> 57:06.382
Don't worry, I'll be gentle.

57:06.382 --> 57:07.925
I promise.

57:10.594 --> 57:14.056
I wonder what this button does.

57:16.142 --> 57:18.102
Sure this is
a good idea, Cap?

57:18.102 --> 57:20.563
The ride was rough enough
with you at the stick.

57:20.563 --> 57:23.482
She's just messing with us,
I hope.

57:23.482 --> 57:26.277
Hey,
I made something for you.

57:30.823 --> 57:34.326
You'd still have the original
if you hadn't come visit me.

57:34.326 --> 57:37.121
And I always liked it, so...

57:39.957 --> 57:42.418
Did I get it right?

57:42.418 --> 57:44.587
Yeah, I think you did.

58:07.401 --> 58:09.778
I never thought
I'd see Inners take orders

58:09.778 --> 58:11.822
from a Belter.

58:13.407 --> 58:15.618
It's high time.

58:22.249 --> 58:25.211
I pissed off
a lot of people.

58:25.211 --> 58:27.546
You certainly did.

58:30.841 --> 58:33.302
I hope I did
the right thing.

58:35.262 --> 58:38.515
You did.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.226
You followed your conscience

58:40.226 --> 58:43.729
in the hope that others
would follow theirs.

58:43.729 --> 58:47.566
You didn't do it for a reward
or a pat on the head.

58:50.653 --> 58:56.784
The universe never tells us
if we did right or wrong.

58:56.784 --> 58:59.995
It's more important
to try to help people

58:59.995 --> 59:02.206
than to know that you did.

59:05.334 --> 59:07.044
Take my station.

59:07.044 --> 59:11.548
More important that
someone else's life gets better

59:11.548 --> 59:14.760
than for you to feel good
about yourself.

59:17.096 --> 59:19.723
You never know the effect
you might have on someone,

59:19.723 --> 59:21.183
not really.

59:21.183 --> 59:23.978
Maybe one core thing
you said haunts them forever.

59:23.978 --> 59:29.566
Maybe one moment of kindness
gives them comfort or courage.

59:29.566 --> 59:34.071
Maybe you said the one thing
they needed to hear.

59:34.071 --> 59:36.532
It doesn't matter
if you ever know.

59:36.532 --> 59:39.576
You just have to try.

59:42.663 --> 59:46.667
You are very wise.

59:46.667 --> 59:49.211
I've lived a hard life.

59:56.260 --> 59:58.220
There's gonna be
a lot of ships

59:58.220 --> 1:00:01.515
heading for the Rings now.

1:00:01.515 --> 1:00:03.183
Piracy will be an issue.

1:00:03.183 --> 1:00:06.687
We could fly security
for freighters,

1:00:06.687 --> 1:00:10.441
maybe get a consulting gig
on one of the colonies.

1:00:13.235 --> 1:00:15.112
And we still don't know
what happened

1:00:15.112 --> 1:00:16.530
to that protomolecule sample.

1:00:16.530 --> 1:00:18.032
Sooner or later,
we're gonna have to...

1:00:18.032 --> 1:00:20.784
Let's just stay here
for a minute.
