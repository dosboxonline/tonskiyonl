01:55.073 --> 01:57.868
Please keep all limbs and branches inside.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.213
I believe this is yours.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.964
Thanks.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.566
Welcome to Element City.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.444
Please have your documents
ready for inspection.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.118
Next.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.288
Your names?

02:46.917 --> 02:49.336
Great. And how do we spell that?

02:54.508 --> 02:58.053
How about we just go with Bernie and Cinder?

03:01.056 --> 03:02.516
Welcome to Element City.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.774
Hot logs.
Hot logs for sale.

03:24.872 --> 03:25.914
Cantankerous guy...

03:26.540 --> 03:28.458
Hey, watch it, Sparky!

03:48.187 --> 03:49.188
Water.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.450
Dry leaves.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.732
I'm okay.

04:51.041 --> 04:55.212
Welcome, my Ember, to your new life.

05:02.261 --> 05:05.180
Our Blue Flame hold all our traditions...

05:05.347 --> 05:07.975
and give us strength to burn bright.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.857
Do I burn as bright?

05:19.278 --> 05:21.905
One, two, one, two, one, two.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.254
This shop is dream of our family.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.882
Someday it'll all be yours.

05:44.136 --> 05:44.970
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.346
Everything here authentic.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.056
Then I've got to try the kol-nuts.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.433
Kol-nuts, coming up.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.976
Kol-nut, coming up.

05:51.894 --> 05:52.978
Good daughter.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.026
Someday this shop will all be mine.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.820
When you are ready.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.246
Delivery!

06:11.622 --> 06:13.123
Two sugar pops, please.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.708
I got it, Àshfá.

06:25.844 --> 06:26.845
Hey!

06:30.390 --> 06:32.643
Water. Keep an eye on them.

06:33.352 --> 06:34.186
Oops.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.604
Oops.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.481
You splash it, you buy it.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.903
You showed them, huh?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.738
Nobody waters down Fire.

06:44.905 --> 06:45.906
Yeah!

06:48.492 --> 06:49.660
Can the shop be mine now?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.328
When you are ready.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.664
-The truth is...
-She's not in love with him.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.499
...I'm not in love with you.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.751
Knew it.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.343
Àshfá, customer.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.137
How about you take it today?

07:09.680 --> 07:10.681
For real?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.190
How can I help you?

07:20.357 --> 07:21.942
All of this and the...

07:22.109 --> 07:23.360
The sparklers are buy one, get one free?

07:23.527 --> 07:24.611
-That's right.
-Great!

07:24.778 --> 07:26.071
I'll just take the free one.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.531
No, see...

07:27.698 --> 07:29.616
you need to buy one to get one free.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.369
But I just want the free one.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.872
Sorry, that's not how this works.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.124
But the customer is always right.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.792
Not in this case.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.253
Nope.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.715
Nope. Nope. Nope.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.175
Just give me one for free!

07:46.341 --> 07:47.843
That's not how this works!

07:52.806 --> 07:53.849
Happy birthday.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.351
What just happened?
Why you lose temper?

07:56.518 --> 07:59.396
I don't know.
He was pushing, and pushing, and it just...

07:59.563 --> 08:00.981
Calm, calm.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.275
Sometimes customer can be tough.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.235
Just take breath...

08:06.486 --> 08:07.821
and make connection.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.158
When you can do that and not lose temper...

08:11.325 --> 08:14.119
then you will be ready to take over shop.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.374
This is too expensive,
and that is not made in Fire Land.

08:19.541 --> 08:20.375
-They weren't crunchy...
-Take breath.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.877
-...and there wasn't enough sauce.
-Make connection.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.922
Take breath.
Make connection.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.882
Take breath.
Make connection.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.717
Take breath.
Make connection!

08:33.179 --> 08:35.807
Sorry. Sorry about that.
Sorry, sorry.

08:36.517 --> 08:40.854
She almost went full purple.
I've never seen anyone go full purple.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.397
Sorry, everyone.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.899
Please forgive my daughter.

08:44.066 --> 08:47.027
She burn bright, but sometimes too bright.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.696
Nice hat, by the way.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.449
Let me make you a new batch.
On the house.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.617
Okay.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.494
Sorry, Àshfá.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.538
I don't know why that one
got away from me.

08:57.955 --> 09:01.250
You are tense
because of big Red Dot Sale tomorrow.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.085
It has us all in a broil.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.253
I guess.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.256
It's just that some of these customers,
they get me all...

09:07.923 --> 09:10.676
I know. I know. Just do what we practice.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.594
You are so good at everything else.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.555
You're right.
I'll get it.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.181
I just want you to rest.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.188
Done.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.235
You okay?

09:28.861 --> 09:29.862
Just tired.

09:30.028 --> 09:30.988
Let me help.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.993
Bernie, that cough is terrible!

09:36.159 --> 09:38.829
Almost as terrible as your cooking!

09:40.831 --> 09:43.709
When you gonna put Ember
out of her misery and retire, huh?

09:43.876 --> 09:46.253
Finally put her name on the sign out there?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.839
She take over when she's ready.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.883
And speaking of ready...

09:51.049 --> 09:53.802
we are more than ready
for you to actually buy something...

09:53.969 --> 09:55.721
if you'd ever get up off your lazy ash.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.431
Burn!

09:59.349 --> 10:01.643
But she is so close.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.355
I mean, she'll probably never do deliveries
as quick as me...

10:05.522 --> 10:07.191
You don't think that I can beat your record?

10:07.357 --> 10:09.067
Because I have been taking it easy on you...

10:09.234 --> 10:11.653
so I don't hurt your feelings,
Mr. Smokestack.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.614
But game on.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.620
Before I see if you are a match...

10:19.786 --> 10:22.039
I splash this on your heart...

10:22.206 --> 10:24.082
to bring love to the surface.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.544
And I will read the smoke.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.843
Ember, I'm doing a reading.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.262
Sorry, got to grab some stuff.
Going for Dad's record.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.264
So, are we a match?

10:39.848 --> 10:41.141
It's true love.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.853
Which is more than I ever smelled
on this one.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.522
Goody, this old chestnut.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.525
Yep. Nothing.

10:49.691 --> 10:53.862
Just a loveless, sad future of sadness.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.656
Ember, work with me.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.909
Your finding match
was my mother's dying wish.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.828
Promise me one thing...

11:01.995 --> 11:04.039
marry Fire.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.085
Nice try, Mom. Got to go.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.129
-Save it for the wedding.
-Hey.

11:12.756 --> 11:13.924
Yo, yo, yo, Ember.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.509
Yo, Clod. Can't talk, in a hurry.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.469
And don't let my dad
catch you out here again.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.973
What? Come on,
he doesn't like my landscaping?

11:21.640 --> 11:22.850
Anyway, June Bloom is coming...

11:23.016 --> 11:26.895
and you just got to be my date
'cause check it out.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.022
I'm all grown up.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.276
And I smell good.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.820
My queen.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.074
Sorry, buddy, elements don't mix.

11:40.868 --> 11:41.785
Flame.
Gotta go.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.954
Come on, go to the festival with me.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.747
You never leave this part of town.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.250
That's because everything I need
is right here.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.466
Plus, the city isn't made
with Fire people in mind.

11:56.633 --> 12:00.012
Sorry, but it'd take an act of God
to get me across that bridge.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.263
An act of God?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.807
Or an act of Clod?

12:05.809 --> 12:06.894
Gotta run.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.995
As ordered.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.043
Gotta run.
Going for Dad's record.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.005
Move it!

12:53.273 --> 12:55.817
Winner winner, charcoal dinner...

13:20.801 --> 13:22.719
Head to bed, I'll close things up.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.764
Still have much to prepare for Red Dot Sale.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.767
Dad, I'll take care of it.
You need to rest.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.104
How?

13:32.271 --> 13:33.605
I learned from the best.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.486
I am old. I can't do this forever.

13:40.070 --> 13:44.157
Now that you've beaten my time,
there's only one thing you haven't done.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.201
Tomorrow I sleep in...

13:46.368 --> 13:49.454
and I want you to run shop for Red Dot Sale.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.373
Seriously? By myself?

13:51.540 --> 13:54.334
If you can do that
without losing your temper...

13:54.501 --> 13:56.879
it will show me you are able to take over.

13:57.713 --> 13:58.881
You got it, Àshfá.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.845
I won't let you down, I swear.
You'll see.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.598
Good daughter.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.352
Yes!

14:14.146 --> 14:17.524
Blue Flame, please, let this go my way.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.077
-Good morning!
-Morning!

14:34.708 --> 14:35.876
Take a breath.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.048
Calm as a candle.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.929
Morning, welcome to The Fireplace.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.937
Whoa, whoa. They're all the same.
Just take one from the top.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.104
Thanks for shopping.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.732
So many stickers for sale.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.443
-Are these fragile?
-No, wait.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.154
You have to pay before you eat.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.741
What's your return policy?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.493
Does this come in a large?

15:11.078 --> 15:11.912
Take breath.

15:12.079 --> 15:12.996
My dad broke this.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.122
Make connection.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.999
Mind if I test this kettle?

15:18.877 --> 15:20.170
Be back in five minutes.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.918
No, no, no.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.547
Stupid temper. Not today.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.135
What is wrong with me?

16:20.522 --> 16:21.356
What the...?

16:23.317 --> 16:25.152
What a happy family.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.446
Is that you and your dad?

16:27.613 --> 16:28.989
I love dads.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.284
And it's your birthday.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.537
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

16:35.704 --> 16:36.538
I don't know.

16:36.705 --> 16:40.709
I was searching for a leak on the other side
of the river and got sucked in.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.003
This is bad, I can't lose another job.

16:43.587 --> 16:47.132
I just can't seem to find my flow.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.051
Dang!

16:49.218 --> 16:51.261
That pipe squished me all out of shape.

16:52.721 --> 16:53.555
That's better.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.098
Dude, just get out of here.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.392
I gotta clean this mess
before my dad sees what I did.

16:59.603 --> 17:00.646
Actually...

17:05.400 --> 17:07.069
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to write you a ticket.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.569
-A ticket?
-Yeah.

17:08.737 --> 17:12.074
I'm a city inspector,
and this pipe is definitely not up to code.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.160
I sucked a city inspector into our pipes?

17:15.327 --> 17:17.204
I know. Ironic, right?

17:17.371 --> 17:18.288
Stop messing with that.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.915
-Well, I need to make sure it's solid.
-Everything's solid.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.752
I should know.
My dad rebuilt this place himself.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.588
Wait, your dad did?

17:26.755 --> 17:30.133
Yes, with his bare hands,
every brick and board.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.844
It was a ruin when he found it.

17:32.010 --> 17:35.138
Wow. He did all of this himself?

17:35.305 --> 17:36.390
Without permits?

17:37.933 --> 17:39.726
I'm gonna have to write that up too.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.311
First, I'm sucked into a pipe...

17:41.478 --> 17:44.356
and now I have to write citations
that could get this place shut down.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.733
Oh, gosh. It's just too much.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.485
Shut us down?

17:48.652 --> 17:50.445
I know, it's awful.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.281
No, you can't shut us down, please.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.741
This is a big day for me.
It's our Red Dot Sale.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.120
Hey, take it easy.
This is as hard on me as it is on you.

17:58.287 --> 17:59.538
-Get back here.
-Sorry.

17:59.705 --> 18:02.332
I got to get these to City Hall
before the end of my shift.

18:06.420 --> 18:07.421
Flame.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.843
Get back here.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.227
Next stop, Element City.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.170
-Hey!
-Sorry.

19:06.772 --> 19:07.773
Hey!

19:14.112 --> 19:15.072
What the...?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.621
This stop, City Hall.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.123
Hands off!

19:27.543 --> 19:28.544
Sorry.

19:35.551 --> 19:36.426
Stop!

19:41.223 --> 19:42.224
Hey!

19:45.561 --> 19:46.478
Stop.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.398
My new jacket.

19:50.023 --> 19:50.858
Whoa!

20:25.642 --> 20:26.852
Hey!

20:30.689 --> 20:32.024
My chili oil!

20:34.067 --> 20:35.444
Come on, guy.

20:35.611 --> 20:36.987
You can't get through this.

20:38.614 --> 20:40.407
So, it is time to hand them over.

20:40.574 --> 20:41.992
Oh, boy, I'm sorry.

20:42.159 --> 20:44.328
This is gonna be
really disappointing for you.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.246
No, no, no.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.539
No, no, no.

20:47.706 --> 20:48.957
Sorry.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.292
Please...

20:50.459 --> 20:51.460
No.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.922
You don't understand.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.470
This shop is my dad's dream.

21:02.471 --> 21:04.723
If I'm the reason it gets shut down...

21:04.890 --> 21:05.933
it will kill him.

21:07.351 --> 21:09.645
He will never trust me to take over.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.940
Why didn't you say that before?

21:14.399 --> 21:16.151
Wait, does that mean
you'll tear up the tickets?

21:16.318 --> 21:18.946
I mean, I would, but I just sent them over...

21:19.112 --> 21:20.155
to the processing department.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.158
But I can take you there
so you can plead your case.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.517
Hey, Fern.

21:48.934 --> 21:49.768
How you doing?

21:49.935 --> 21:51.854
Living the dream.

21:52.938 --> 21:55.732
You know those citations
I just gave you from Firetown?

21:55.899 --> 21:59.403
I was about to send them to Mrs. Cumulus.

21:59.570 --> 22:01.864
Then get sprayed for fungus rot.

22:02.030 --> 22:02.948
Wait.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.327
Tell him what you told me
about your dad and letting him down.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.537
No. That's personal.

22:08.704 --> 22:09.788
It really got to me.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.248
He might feel it too.

22:11.415 --> 22:13.750
-Her dad will be...
-Nope. Nope.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.211
...super disappointed in her.

22:16.295 --> 22:17.129
Stop it.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.882
He might even be ashamed.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.008
What are you doing?

22:21.175 --> 22:22.342
But the main thing is...

22:22.509 --> 22:25.971
if her father can't retire,
it will be all Ember's...

22:26.430 --> 22:27.681
Stop talking!

22:40.152 --> 22:42.821
Looks like I'm going home early today.

22:42.988 --> 22:43.989
No, don't.

22:45.657 --> 22:48.785
Expect to get shut down within a week.

22:48.952 --> 22:49.786
Have a good one.

22:53.290 --> 22:54.750
Sorry.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.007
What?

23:03.091 --> 23:04.092
Already?

23:04.801 --> 23:05.802
Hello?

23:17.147 --> 23:18.023
Oh, no.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.483
Dad, what happened?

23:19.650 --> 23:22.945
We lucky nobody hurt.
It ruined Red Dot Sale.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.655
-Did he do this?
-Who?

23:24.821 --> 23:26.823
The Water guy I see you chase.

23:29.826 --> 23:30.994
Yeah, he did.

23:31.954 --> 23:34.581
He just broke through a pipe.
I don't know why.

23:34.748 --> 23:38.210
Luckily, I was able to close it off.
I couldn't catch him though.

23:38.377 --> 23:40.879
Water, always trying to water us down.

23:41.046 --> 23:44.091
He was a Water person, Dad, not just water.

23:44.383 --> 23:46.593
Same thing.
And why is water in pipes?

23:46.760 --> 23:50.597
City shut down years ago.
There should be no water.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.432
Dad!

23:54.101 --> 23:55.102
Bernie.

23:55.561 --> 23:56.687
We will get through this.

23:56.854 --> 23:58.146
Just like before.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.565
Before?

24:00.023 --> 24:02.359
There is a reason we left Fire Land.

24:03.193 --> 24:06.280
Ember, we loved it there so much.

24:07.114 --> 24:09.491
Most everyone had a Blue Flame.

24:09.658 --> 24:11.910
And it connected us all together.

24:12.327 --> 24:15.038
To our traditions. Our family.

24:15.205 --> 24:17.040
It was hard living.

24:17.207 --> 24:20.085
But your father began to build a life for us.

24:20.252 --> 24:22.004
We put everything into it.

24:22.421 --> 24:24.423
But then a great storm came.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.895
All was lost for us.

24:38.812 --> 24:43.817
Your father understood
we had to leave everything.

24:43.984 --> 24:48.238
Our home. It was the only way
to create a better life.

24:57.331 --> 25:00.876
It was the last time
your father ever saw his family.

25:03.295 --> 25:05.506
That is why we came here.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.508
To build all this.

25:13.931 --> 25:18.852
Àshfá, nothing will happen to this shop
or the flame again, I promise.

25:21.271 --> 25:22.481
Good daughter.

25:35.661 --> 25:36.745
Fire! Fire!

25:37.204 --> 25:38.455
-Fire!
-Hey, hey!

25:38.622 --> 25:39.498
Sorry.

25:40.082 --> 25:41.208
You're so hot.

25:42.209 --> 25:43.085
Excuse me?

25:44.127 --> 25:46.255
No, I mean, like, you're smoking.

25:46.421 --> 25:47.464
No, I didn't mean it like that.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.341
-Are you done yet?
-Yes, please.

25:49.508 --> 25:50.926
I'm waiting to talk to your boss.

25:51.093 --> 25:54.054
So, make like a stream
and flow somewhere else.

25:54.221 --> 25:55.889
Actually, Gale won't be in today.

25:56.056 --> 25:57.808
She's a huge airball fan...

25:57.975 --> 26:00.310
and the Windbreakers
are finally in the playoffs.

26:00.477 --> 26:01.812
Toot toot.

26:02.646 --> 26:04.606
Okay. Well, I just came by...

26:04.773 --> 26:07.192
because I left my passes
for the game here last night.

26:07.651 --> 26:09.862
Passes? Like, plural?

26:41.143 --> 26:41.977
Where is she?

26:42.144 --> 26:43.520
Up there, in that skybox.

26:43.812 --> 26:45.647
Come on!

26:46.773 --> 26:49.568
Okay. Time to cancel some tickets.

26:50.736 --> 26:52.321
Toot Toot juice.

26:52.738 --> 26:54.781
Get your Toot Toot juice.

26:55.532 --> 26:59.494
Toot Toot juice,
get your Toot Toot juice.

27:00.537 --> 27:02.039
You'll be great. This way.

27:02.206 --> 27:03.624
-Excuse me.
-Jimmy, what's up?

27:03.790 --> 27:05.834
-Sorry. Pardon.
-Wendy.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.961
Sorry. Fire girl coming through.

27:08.128 --> 27:10.797
Break some wind!

27:10.964 --> 27:12.299
Hi, Gale, how you doing?

27:12.466 --> 27:14.259
Look at the score, what do you think?

27:14.426 --> 27:16.762
Blow the ball, not the game!

27:18.055 --> 27:20.599
Yeah, so, Gale.

27:21.266 --> 27:24.770
My name is Ember Lumen.
My family runs a Fire shop.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.730
Wade wrote us a bunch of tickets yesterday...

27:26.897 --> 27:28.774
What kind of call was that?

27:28.941 --> 27:31.860
Lumen? Yeah, a Fire shop
with 30 citations.

27:32.027 --> 27:33.445
Thirty?

27:33.612 --> 27:37.658
Anyway, friend, I was hoping
we could work something out.

27:37.824 --> 27:41.036
Come on, ref!
Are your eyes in the back of your head?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.874
-Oh, no.
-Yeah, bummer.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.961
Yeah. Okay, so, the 30 citations.

27:49.127 --> 27:52.840
Do you mind? There's a game going on.
Fireball.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.383
Fireball?

27:55.384 --> 27:56.885
Actually, I do mind.

27:57.052 --> 28:00.013
This is my life we're talking about.
Not just some game.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.808
Some game?
This is the playoffs.

28:02.975 --> 28:05.644
So, forgive me
if I don't want to hear a sob story...

28:05.811 --> 28:08.438
about the problems of some little shop.

28:08.605 --> 28:11.483
Well, that little shop matters way more...

28:11.650 --> 28:14.736
than a bunch of overpaid cloud puffs
blowing some ball around.

28:14.903 --> 28:16.405
I dare you...

28:16.572 --> 28:19.908
say "cloud puffs" one more time.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.870
Cloud puffs.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.081
Oh, no!

28:26.248 --> 28:27.082
Lutz!

28:38.010 --> 28:41.680
Lutz, man. He's been in such a funk
'cause his mom has been sick.

28:45.267 --> 28:49.104
That is so not cool, he's doing his best.

28:49.271 --> 28:52.482
We love you, Lutz!

28:52.649 --> 28:54.818
Lutz!

28:55.444 --> 28:58.322
We love you, Lutz!

28:58.488 --> 29:01.200
We love you, Lutz!
Come on!

29:01.366 --> 29:04.077
We love you, Lutz! Everybody!

29:04.244 --> 29:07.706
We love you, Lutz!
We love you, Lutz!

29:07.831 --> 29:10.792
We love you, Lutz!
We love you, Lutz!

29:34.942 --> 29:36.693
-Yay!
-Yeah! Way to go, Lutz!

29:37.402 --> 29:38.946
Yeah, Lutz!

29:39.112 --> 29:40.614
That was amazing, Lutz!

29:42.658 --> 29:44.910
Yeah! Yeah! Yes!

29:55.921 --> 29:57.506
What a comeback.

29:57.673 --> 30:00.342
Check out who found the gift shop.

30:00.926 --> 30:03.262
I gotta admit, that was pretty cool.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.806
You can see why I can get all churned up...

30:05.973 --> 30:09.560
but as a cloud puff who used to
come here with her dad...

30:09.726 --> 30:11.895
all these wins mean a little bit more.

30:12.062 --> 30:15.691
And as a fireball who's supposed
to take over her dad's shop...

30:15.858 --> 30:19.027
I sure don't want to let him down,
and I could use a win, too.

30:20.571 --> 30:22.614
Now, I just got to stop water
from coming in.

30:22.781 --> 30:25.200
-Water? In Firetown?
-Yeah.

30:25.367 --> 30:27.202
Water was shut off to there years ago.

30:27.369 --> 30:28.203
Forget the tickets...

30:28.370 --> 30:32.332
I'm gonna have to take apart your dad's shop
to figure out what's going on.

30:32.499 --> 30:33.500
You can't!

30:33.667 --> 30:36.420
My dad put his whole life into that place.

30:36.587 --> 30:38.964
I bet this is connected
to that fluffing leak.

30:39.339 --> 30:41.884
Yeah, we've been trying
to track down a leak in the city.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.552
It's why I was in the canal and...

30:43.719 --> 30:47.014
Wait, I know where
I got sucked into Ember's shop.

30:47.181 --> 30:51.101
Ember and I could track the water
from her shop to find the source of the leak.

30:51.435 --> 30:52.519
Keep talking.

30:52.686 --> 30:55.189
I could call in a city crew
to fix whatever we find.

30:55.355 --> 30:59.026
Yes. And there'd be no need
to touch my dad's shop.

31:01.278 --> 31:02.779
You're lucky you're a cute couple.

31:03.155 --> 31:03.989
We're not a...

31:04.156 --> 31:05.032
You got until Friday.

31:05.199 --> 31:08.327
If you can find the leak
and get a crew to fix it by then...

31:08.493 --> 31:09.745
those tickets are forgiven.

31:09.912 --> 31:13.665
If not, your dad's shop gets shut down.

31:14.917 --> 31:17.252
Break wind! Break wind!

31:17.419 --> 31:18.420
Thank you.

31:21.423 --> 31:23.467
-Please take all that off.
-But I got you a hat.

31:27.429 --> 31:29.181
Okay.

31:29.932 --> 31:33.352
Just keep out of sight, okay?
It'd be a whole thing.

31:33.519 --> 31:35.103
Now water upstairs?

31:36.146 --> 31:37.272
It's in the walls.

31:37.439 --> 31:41.193
I don't understand.
I fix one pipe and another one leaks.

31:41.693 --> 31:42.694
Water!

31:45.781 --> 31:46.865
How could it be worse?

31:47.032 --> 31:50.827
Now that the water's back, the pressure
is forcing it up to all your pipes.

31:50.994 --> 31:52.538
We gotta find the source.

31:53.163 --> 31:54.748
How did you even end up here?

31:55.541 --> 31:59.086
Well, I was in the canals
checking the doors for leaks...

31:59.253 --> 32:01.421
when I found some water
that shouldn't have been there.

32:02.339 --> 32:05.259
Rusty with a hint of motor oil?

32:06.426 --> 32:07.803
There was this whoosh of water.

32:09.054 --> 32:10.931
And I got sucked into a filtering system.

32:11.098 --> 32:12.099
Help!

32:12.599 --> 32:14.726
But then I heard this explosion.

32:19.147 --> 32:20.941
That's how I ended up at your place.

32:21.149 --> 32:24.069
Oh, flame! My temper caused this.

32:24.236 --> 32:27.072
So, we're searching for water
somewhere in a canal?

32:27.406 --> 32:29.116
Those canals go everywhere.

32:29.283 --> 32:32.327
It's why tracking down that leak
has been so dang hard.

32:32.494 --> 32:33.328
The roof.

32:41.503 --> 32:43.005
You might want to step back.

32:49.219 --> 32:50.888
Holy dew drop!

32:51.763 --> 32:52.764
Get in.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.958
Okay, that's where I got sucked in.

33:21.502 --> 33:23.504
More water.
Go that way.

33:29.426 --> 33:30.469
Yeah, right there.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.306
Nothing weird going on here.

33:34.765 --> 33:36.642
Just a little pruning.

33:51.532 --> 33:55.452
So, what do you do at the shop?
If you don't mind me asking.

33:55.619 --> 33:58.121
My dad's retiring and I'll be taking over.

33:58.288 --> 33:59.289
Someday.

34:00.415 --> 34:01.583
When I'm ready.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.669
It must be nice knowing what you're gonna do.

34:03.836 --> 34:06.380
After my dad passed,
I got all, "What's the point?"

34:06.755 --> 34:08.799
Now I just go from one job to the next.

34:09.550 --> 34:11.176
There's a word in Firish.

34:11.552 --> 34:12.594
Tìshók.

34:13.094 --> 34:16.931
It means embrace the light while it burns
because it won't always last forever.

34:17.850 --> 34:21.143
Tee-shook.

34:21.812 --> 34:23.188
Or something like that.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.696
-You okay?
-Yeah.

34:30.862 --> 34:31.864
You sure?

34:32.781 --> 34:35.826
It's just, that building over there...

34:36.284 --> 34:38.078
that's Garden Central Station.

34:38.661 --> 34:43.292
When I was a kid, my dad took me there
because they had a Vivisteria tree.

34:44.251 --> 34:46.460
I'd always wanted to see one.

34:47.129 --> 34:49.922
It's the only flower that can thrive
in any environment.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.010
Fire included.

34:54.011 --> 34:55.888
I was so excited.

34:56.054 --> 34:58.182
But they said our fire was too dangerous...

34:59.141 --> 35:00.475
and they wouldn't let us in.

35:01.935 --> 35:03.520
Go back to Fire Land.

35:03.687 --> 35:05.147
My dad was so angry...

35:05.314 --> 35:07.482
-Burn somewhere else!
-Get outta here!

35:07.566 --> 35:08.859
...and embarrassed.

35:09.484 --> 35:11.445
The building flooded a few years later.

35:11.612 --> 35:14.448
So, I missed my one chance
to see a Vivisteria.

35:18.702 --> 35:20.662
You must have been so scared.

35:22.748 --> 35:23.874
I was.

35:26.251 --> 35:27.419
How do you do that?

35:27.586 --> 35:29.338
-Do what?
-Draw people in?

35:29.505 --> 35:31.507
You got a whole stadium to connect with you.

35:32.049 --> 35:34.593
I can't even connect with one customer.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.637
My stupid temper always kicks in.

35:36.803 --> 35:39.389
I guess I just say what I feel.

35:39.556 --> 35:41.433
And I don't think a temper is so bad.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.477
Sometimes when I lose my temper...

35:43.644 --> 35:47.022
I think it's just me trying
to tell me something I'm not ready to hear.

35:47.189 --> 35:48.941
That's ridiculous.

35:49.107 --> 35:50.108
Maybe.

35:50.859 --> 35:51.777
Hey, there.

35:51.944 --> 35:53.111
Put us down there.

35:58.951 --> 36:00.244
That's not right.

36:03.747 --> 36:04.706
Motor oil.

36:04.873 --> 36:06.542
Yup, this is the source.

36:07.835 --> 36:08.877
Why is there no water?

36:09.044 --> 36:10.420
Because the doors are broken.

36:10.587 --> 36:14.174
This is supposed to catch spill over
from those main canals and...

36:19.638 --> 36:20.889
Run for your life!

36:25.894 --> 36:27.062
Help!

36:30.774 --> 36:31.608
Grab this!

36:40.534 --> 36:41.368
Firetown.

36:50.294 --> 36:51.295
Catch!

37:14.443 --> 37:16.570
Ember, throw me more!

37:29.249 --> 37:31.168
So, will this hold?

37:31.960 --> 37:33.754
Yup. It should for sure.

37:33.921 --> 37:37.633
At least long enough for me
to get a city crew to fix it before Friday.

37:38.759 --> 37:39.593
What?

37:39.760 --> 37:41.970
You've got a little sand.

37:43.347 --> 37:45.432
Here? Here?

37:45.599 --> 37:46.892
It's right there.

37:52.356 --> 37:53.941
Thanks.

37:55.609 --> 37:58.278
Well, let me know when it's done, I guess.

37:58.445 --> 38:00.697
I'll make sure there's a city crew
here by Friday.

38:01.323 --> 38:03.408
Okay. See ya.

38:03.575 --> 38:04.409
Wait.

38:06.078 --> 38:08.330
Any chance you're free tomorrow?

38:09.331 --> 38:12.376
To hang out with a Water guy?

38:12.543 --> 38:15.587
With a Water guy?
My dad would boil you alive.

38:15.754 --> 38:17.798
He doesn't have to know.
We can meet in the city.

38:17.965 --> 38:19.967
I promise, nothing weird.

38:20.133 --> 38:21.844
Maybe a little pruning?

38:23.053 --> 38:25.138
Sorry, that's not going to happen.

38:25.305 --> 38:27.266
You smiled. I saw it.

38:27.432 --> 38:30.894
Tomorrow, I'll be at the Alkali Theater.
3:00!

38:32.271 --> 38:33.689
Yeah because then you know with the light...

38:34.481 --> 38:36.441
Your ceiling is dripping again.

38:36.608 --> 38:37.484
More leaks?

38:37.651 --> 38:40.863
Don't worry.
This whole problem is going away.

38:41.446 --> 38:43.323
I can feel it.

38:46.285 --> 38:50.789
And since we're all good,
I am also going away to do deliveries.

38:52.749 --> 38:55.460
Do I smell something on Ember?

38:57.379 --> 38:58.714
Yo, Ember.

38:58.881 --> 38:59.715
Clod.

38:59.882 --> 39:00.966
I grew another one.

39:02.968 --> 39:04.553
My queen.

39:06.054 --> 39:07.514
Oops, sorry, but gotta go.

39:19.109 --> 39:24.239
Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where I was gonna go next

39:24.406 --> 39:28.869
Didn't know until I saw your face
I was missin' out on every moment

39:29.578 --> 39:34.499
You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?

39:36.084 --> 39:37.794
I'm into you

39:38.837 --> 39:45.052
So if it's real,
then, darlin', let me know

39:49.264 --> 39:55.479
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show

40:05.948 --> 40:08.367
You and I,
we go together

40:08.534 --> 40:10.786
You're the sky
I'll be the weather

40:10.953 --> 40:13.872
A pretty thing, the sunny rain
who knew?

40:14.373 --> 40:16.250
Oh, yeah

40:16.416 --> 40:18.544
Summer night,
perfect occasion

40:18.919 --> 40:21.797
Where am I?
You know I'll be waitin' for you

40:23.507 --> 40:25.467
Oh, for you

40:25.634 --> 40:31.890
So if it's real,
then, darlin', let me know

40:35.894 --> 40:40.190
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show

40:40.357 --> 40:41.900
Who is this guy?

40:42.067 --> 40:43.652
Shine

40:44.278 --> 40:48.156
You shine, like forever

40:49.241 --> 40:50.367
Lasts forever

40:52.119 --> 40:57.749
You shine, you shine,
and steal the show

41:01.879 --> 41:08.385
So if it's real
then, darlin', let me know

41:12.306 --> 41:18.520
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show

41:18.687 --> 41:22.524
Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where I was gonna go next

41:22.691 --> 41:29.198
So if it's real
then, darlin', let me know

41:29.364 --> 41:30.365
Whoa.

41:31.617 --> 41:32.910
How'd you do that?

41:33.410 --> 41:35.704
It's the minerals.
Check this out.

41:38.081 --> 41:39.166
Awesome.

41:47.716 --> 41:49.968
Wow.
Watch this.

43:01.248 --> 43:02.249
Another?

43:09.673 --> 43:10.757
No, no, no!

43:10.924 --> 43:12.342
The water is back.

43:19.349 --> 43:20.475
Ember Lumen.

43:20.642 --> 43:22.853
Delivery for Ember Lumen.

43:23.020 --> 43:25.314
Flowers for Ember?

43:29.818 --> 43:32.279
Excuse me. These are so beautiful.

43:32.446 --> 43:33.739
I'm gonna go put these away.

43:38.452 --> 43:39.453
What are you doing here?

43:39.620 --> 43:42.247
I got bad news.
The sandbags didn't hold.

43:42.414 --> 43:43.415
Obviously.

43:43.582 --> 43:46.210
Yeah. And I also got worse news.

43:46.376 --> 43:50.631
I'd forgotten a tiny detail
about the last time I saw that city crew.

43:50.797 --> 43:53.467
You knocked over three tons of cement dust.

43:53.634 --> 43:56.094
Half the guys still haven't recovered.

43:57.179 --> 44:00.599
I guess you could say
they still have hard feelings...

44:01.433 --> 44:02.351
because they won't help us.

44:02.518 --> 44:04.561
Wade, Gale's deadline is tomorrow.

44:04.728 --> 44:05.896
We need more sandbags.

44:06.063 --> 44:07.356
But that didn't work before.

44:07.523 --> 44:09.107
Well, I can't just do nothing.

44:09.274 --> 44:10.943
Ember, did you fix leak?

44:11.485 --> 44:13.070
-It's you again.
-Who? Me?

44:13.237 --> 44:14.738
You're the guy who started all this.

44:15.405 --> 44:16.823
No, Dad. Different guy.

44:17.324 --> 44:18.784
Not all Water looks alike.

44:18.951 --> 44:20.827
You are city inspector?

44:21.745 --> 44:23.413
No.
Right?

44:23.580 --> 44:26.041
Right! I am not an inspector.

44:28.919 --> 44:30.170
You are inspector.

44:30.337 --> 44:33.090
Why you poking around?
Is this because of water leak?

44:33.257 --> 44:36.343
No. Not because of water in any way.

44:37.261 --> 44:39.012
He's a different kind of inspector.

44:39.179 --> 44:40.013
Right?

44:40.180 --> 44:41.306
Yeah. Yeah.

44:42.057 --> 44:44.768
I'm a food inspector.

44:44.935 --> 44:47.521
I've come to inspect your food.

44:48.230 --> 44:50.357
I think he's lying through his feet.

44:50.524 --> 44:52.067
-Teeth.
-Whatever.

44:52.234 --> 44:53.652
Food upstairs. Come.

44:53.819 --> 44:55.112
Food inspector?

44:55.279 --> 44:56.280
I panicked.

44:58.991 --> 45:00.659
You really food inspector?

45:00.826 --> 45:02.286
As far as you know, yeah.

45:03.370 --> 45:05.372
Then inspect this.

45:06.206 --> 45:07.457
Dad.

45:09.418 --> 45:10.794
Yep, all looks good to me.

45:10.961 --> 45:14.882
No, no, no.
Inspect with your mouth.

45:44.620 --> 45:46.997
You see? He likes it.

45:49.291 --> 45:51.960
You must try these.
Straight from Fire Land.

45:52.127 --> 45:53.587
Dad, those are too hot.

45:53.754 --> 45:55.881
I'm okay.
I love hot food.

46:02.930 --> 46:04.848
Hey! Watch your water.

46:05.015 --> 46:06.517
So, did we pass?

46:07.684 --> 46:08.810
A plus.

46:09.978 --> 46:13.982
Actually, after the heat dies down,
that's really good.

46:14.775 --> 46:16.109
If you don't mind.

46:25.702 --> 46:28.622
See? It's really tasty
if you water it down a little.

46:28.872 --> 46:30.332
Water us down?

46:30.874 --> 46:32.042
Water us down?

46:32.209 --> 46:33.377
Where's camera?

46:34.044 --> 46:37.214
We will never be watered down by you.
Get out!

46:37.381 --> 46:38.757
All right, sir, you gotta go.

46:41.218 --> 46:43.095
Dad, don't worry.
I've got this.

46:45.013 --> 46:47.850
Look, meet me at the beach
and we'll make more sandbags.

46:48.016 --> 46:50.018
We have to figure out
how to fix those doors.

46:50.185 --> 46:52.312
Water want to water us down?

46:52.896 --> 46:55.649
Then Water no longer allowed in shop.

46:55.816 --> 46:57.568
He is panned.

46:58.318 --> 46:59.152
Banned.

46:59.319 --> 47:00.320
Banned!

47:01.905 --> 47:03.824
Àshfá, it's okay.

47:03.991 --> 47:07.578
It's all going to be okay.

47:16.670 --> 47:18.172
I don't think this is going to work.

47:18.338 --> 47:20.716
Well, it won't
unless you hold the bag straight.

47:20.883 --> 47:23.552
Maybe your dad will understand.

47:23.719 --> 47:24.720
I'm serious.

47:24.887 --> 47:26.722
Look, I know it can be tough.

47:26.889 --> 47:30.684
I mean, with my dad,
we were like oil and water.

47:30.851 --> 47:32.477
I never got a chance to fix that.

47:33.270 --> 47:34.438
But you guys are different.

47:36.023 --> 47:37.649
It might be time to tell him.

47:37.816 --> 47:39.735
Yeah, right. And tell him what?

47:39.902 --> 47:42.738
That I got us shut down
and destroyed his dream?

47:52.789 --> 47:54.416
I think I'm failing.

47:56.084 --> 48:00.005
My Àshfá should have retired years ago,
but he doesn't think I'm ready.

48:01.340 --> 48:04.760
You have no idea how hard they've worked.

48:05.469 --> 48:07.095
Or what they've had to endure.

48:07.888 --> 48:09.681
Family they left behind.

48:10.432 --> 48:13.268
How do you repay a sacrifice that big?

48:13.602 --> 48:15.437
It all feels like a burden.

48:15.604 --> 48:17.439
How can I say that?

48:17.606 --> 48:19.066
I'm a bad daughter.

48:19.233 --> 48:22.361
Hey, no. You're doing your best.

48:24.404 --> 48:25.489
I'm a mess.

48:26.073 --> 48:28.742
Nah. I think you're even more beautiful.

48:40.712 --> 48:44.758
Maybe you're right when you said
my temper is me trying to tell me something.

48:47.678 --> 48:50.013
Look what your fire did to the sand.

48:50.889 --> 48:52.099
It's glass.

49:01.275 --> 49:04.361
It looks like a Vivisteria flower.

49:06.446 --> 49:08.365
I know how to seal those doors.

49:28.385 --> 49:29.386
Yes.

49:41.773 --> 49:42.816
Are you crying?

49:42.983 --> 49:44.193
Yes.

49:44.359 --> 49:47.905
I've just never been punched in the face
with beauty before.

50:02.044 --> 50:03.128
It worked!

50:03.295 --> 50:04.963
I'll have Gale come by right after work.

50:05.130 --> 50:06.965
I'll let you know the second I hear anything.

50:07.132 --> 50:08.425
You think this will be good enough for her?

50:08.592 --> 50:12.137
Honestly, it's hard to know.
She could go either way.

50:14.765 --> 50:16.642
Here. I saved this for you.

50:18.602 --> 50:19.686
It's special.

50:33.617 --> 50:35.327
Àshfá, you okay?

50:35.494 --> 50:38.580
Yes, yes. Just too much to fix.

50:38.747 --> 50:39.873
I'll take care of it.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.334
You need to rest, and that's an order.

50:42.501 --> 50:43.794
Yes, ma'am.

50:46.296 --> 50:48.757
Ember, I see a change in you.

50:48.924 --> 50:51.677
Happier, calmer with customers...

50:51.844 --> 50:55.305
and with that food inspector.

50:55.556 --> 50:57.516
Always putting shop first.

50:58.725 --> 51:00.936
You prove I can trust you.

51:07.359 --> 51:09.820
I'm so lucky I have you.

51:24.084 --> 51:25.002
Love?

51:44.730 --> 51:46.940
Ember, you found it.
Everything okay?

51:47.107 --> 51:49.401
Please tell me that
you have some good news from Gale.

51:49.568 --> 51:51.570
I'm getting really worried about my dad.

51:51.737 --> 51:52.905
This has to break my way.

51:53.071 --> 51:56.408
Yeah, I haven't heard from her yet,
but she swore she'd call tonight.

51:56.575 --> 51:58.952
Actually, my family stopped by for dinner.

51:59.119 --> 52:01.121
You want to come up
and wait for the call together?

52:01.288 --> 52:02.706
Your family?

52:08.420 --> 52:10.839
Okay. I'll come up for a bit.

52:12.132 --> 52:13.884
I'm sorry, you live here?

52:14.051 --> 52:14.968
It's my mom's place.

52:15.135 --> 52:16.053
Oh, my gosh!

52:19.014 --> 52:22.809
I'm afraid I can't let you in.
Residents and guests only.

52:23.769 --> 52:25.854
Okay. I understand.

52:29.358 --> 52:31.360
You're surprisingly good at your job.

52:31.527 --> 52:33.654
You're surprisingly fast for your age.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.697
You have no idea.

52:37.491 --> 52:40.494
Ember! I'm so excited to finally meet you.

52:41.036 --> 52:43.288
Do we hug, or wave, or...?

52:43.455 --> 52:45.082
Don't want to put you out.

52:45.624 --> 52:46.959
A hello is fine.

52:47.125 --> 52:50.671
Hardly. Wade hasn't stopped talking about you
since the day you met.

52:50.838 --> 52:52.673
-The boy is smitten.
-Mom.

52:52.840 --> 52:56.468
Oh, come on. I'm your mother.
I know when something's lighting you up.

52:56.635 --> 52:59.346
I just didn't know she'd be so smoky.

53:03.058 --> 53:05.477
Come this way, meet the rest of the family.

53:17.489 --> 53:19.908
Oh, honey, you won't believe
what your baby niece did today.

53:20.075 --> 53:21.910
She smiled.

53:22.077 --> 53:23.912
No, she didn't.

53:26.665 --> 53:27.541
Yeah.

53:29.376 --> 53:31.044
Hey, everyone, this is Ember.

53:31.420 --> 53:32.421
Hey!

53:32.588 --> 53:34.756
That's my brother Alan and his wife Eddy.

53:34.923 --> 53:35.757
Hi.

53:35.841 --> 53:38.093
And we got two kids that are
swimmin' around here somewhere.

53:38.260 --> 53:40.387
Marco! Polo!

53:40.804 --> 53:41.805
What?

53:42.347 --> 53:43.557
Hi, Uncle Wade!

53:43.724 --> 53:46.435
-Do you die if you fall in water?
-Whoa!

53:46.602 --> 53:48.687
-Marco!
-Kids, right?

53:48.854 --> 53:49.855
Don't hate us.

53:50.022 --> 53:51.899
Anyway, that's my little sib, Lake...

53:52.065 --> 53:53.734
-and her girlfriend, Ghibli.
-'Sup!

53:53.901 --> 53:56.195
They're students at
Element City School for the Arts.

53:56.361 --> 53:57.863
Yeah. Following in Mom's wake.

53:58.030 --> 53:59.781
Nonsense. I'm just an architect.

53:59.948 --> 54:02.075
The real artist is my brother, Harold.

54:02.618 --> 54:04.995
I just dabble in watercolors.

54:05.162 --> 54:07.915
Or as we like to call them, "colors."

54:08.081 --> 54:10.626
Don't listen to him.
He's a wonderful painter.

54:10.792 --> 54:14.004
One of his paintings just got in the
Element City Museum's permanent collection.

54:14.171 --> 54:15.839
Wow, that is so cool.

54:16.006 --> 54:18.175
My only talent is "Clean up on aisle four."

54:18.342 --> 54:19.426
Talk about being modest.

54:19.593 --> 54:21.678
Ember's got an incredible creative flame.

54:21.845 --> 54:23.180
I've never seen anything like it.

54:23.347 --> 54:27.809
I just have to say that
you speak so well and clear.

54:29.561 --> 54:30.562
Yeah, it's amazing...

54:30.771 --> 54:33.357
what talking in the same language
your entire life can do.

54:34.024 --> 54:34.858
Hey, Ember...

54:35.025 --> 54:38.737
did Wadey here ever tell you that
he's deathly afraid of sponges?

54:38.904 --> 54:39.738
No.

54:39.905 --> 54:41.615
I was traumatized.

54:51.291 --> 54:53.210
I still can't use a sponge around him.

54:53.377 --> 54:55.254
I was stuck in there for hours.

54:56.755 --> 54:58.340
Alan! That was new.

54:58.507 --> 55:00.968
My bad. I'm all whirlpools tonight.

55:01.134 --> 55:01.969
I can fix it.

55:24.449 --> 55:25.284
Sorry.

55:26.201 --> 55:28.287
That was incredible!

55:29.746 --> 55:30.956
It's just melted glass.

55:31.123 --> 55:32.374
"Just melted glass"?

55:32.541 --> 55:36.003
Every building in the new city
is built from just "melted glass".

55:36.170 --> 55:38.213
Oh, no, you have to do something
with that talent.

55:39.590 --> 55:42.217
See, I told you, you're special.

55:46.722 --> 55:47.556
Thought bubble.

55:47.723 --> 55:50.976
Maybe after dinner we play The Crying Game?

55:51.560 --> 55:52.394
Yes, yes, yes.

55:52.561 --> 55:54.855
Let me guess, you try to cry?

55:55.022 --> 55:57.149
We try not to cry.

55:57.316 --> 55:59.318
You have one minute. Go!

56:01.320 --> 56:04.406
1979. November. You were...

56:07.117 --> 56:10.829
Never got a chance to say goodbye to Nana.

56:12.706 --> 56:13.874
Damn, you're good.

56:14.041 --> 56:16.376
Okay, Ember, Wade, you're up.

56:18.003 --> 56:22.508
Yeah, this is almost unfair
because I have literally never cried.

56:22.674 --> 56:24.051
You got no chance.

56:24.218 --> 56:26.386
Sounds like a challenge.

56:26.553 --> 56:28.055
Ready, go!

56:28.222 --> 56:30.849
Butterfly, windshield wipers...

56:31.016 --> 56:32.935
half a butterfly.

56:37.689 --> 56:38.982
Okay.

56:39.149 --> 56:43.320
An old man on his deathbed
remembers the summer he fell in love.

56:43.487 --> 56:46.365
She was out of his league
and he was young and scared.

56:47.699 --> 56:50.285
He let her go, thinking surely
summer would come again.

56:52.454 --> 56:53.330
It never did.

56:54.998 --> 56:56.667
Almost out of time.

56:59.795 --> 57:00.796
Ember...

57:01.755 --> 57:04.508
when I met you I thought I was drowning.

57:05.634 --> 57:07.302
But that light...

57:07.636 --> 57:11.515
that light inside you
has made me feel so alive.

57:13.559 --> 57:16.186
And all I want now is to be near it.

57:17.563 --> 57:18.564
Near you.

57:19.314 --> 57:20.315
Together.

57:50.387 --> 57:52.222
Hello? Gale, hi.

57:52.389 --> 57:55.017
Glass? You repaired it with glass?

57:55.184 --> 57:56.059
Hold the storm.

57:58.645 --> 58:01.773
Tempered glass. Solid as a rock, I like it.

58:01.940 --> 58:04.234
Consider the tickets cancelled.

58:05.944 --> 58:07.613
-We did it?
-Yup!

58:09.781 --> 58:10.657
Awesome!

58:15.913 --> 58:17.331
Thank you, Mrs. Ripple.

58:17.915 --> 58:18.957
This was...

58:19.875 --> 58:20.792
This was really great.

58:20.959 --> 58:21.960
Yeah, it was.

58:22.127 --> 58:24.463
And I mean what I said about your talent.

58:24.630 --> 58:28.008
I have a friend who runs
the best glassmaking firm in the world.

58:28.175 --> 58:30.427
During dinner,
I slipped out and I made a call...

58:30.594 --> 58:32.721
and I told her about you.

58:32.888 --> 58:34.097
They're looking for an intern.

58:34.264 --> 58:36.475
It could be an amazing opportunity.

58:36.767 --> 58:37.601
For real?

58:37.768 --> 58:40.562
It's a long way from the city,
but it would be an incredible start.

58:40.729 --> 58:42.773
You have a bright future.

58:43.357 --> 58:46.151
Look at me, I have an original Ember.

58:48.237 --> 58:49.821
Hold up, I'll walk you out.

58:51.573 --> 58:54.368
I'm afraid you're still
going to have to...

58:54.535 --> 58:55.452
wait out here, ma'am.

58:55.619 --> 58:57.037
And I'm afraid...

58:58.121 --> 58:59.540
I will throw up.

59:07.589 --> 59:08.590
Ember.

59:08.757 --> 59:09.967
Ember, hold up, what's going on?

59:10.133 --> 59:12.052
I can't believe
she basically offered me a job.

59:12.219 --> 59:14.012
I know! Could be cool.

59:14.179 --> 59:15.264
Yeah, super cool, Wade.

59:15.430 --> 59:18.392
I could move out and make glass
in a faraway city. Do whatever I want.

59:18.767 --> 59:20.727
-I don't understand.
-I'm going home.

59:20.894 --> 59:22.271
Fine, then I'm going with you.

59:25.023 --> 59:26.984
A Water guy?

59:31.780 --> 59:34.700
Look, my mom was just trying to be helpful.

59:34.867 --> 59:37.327
She doesn't know
how excited you are to run the shop.

59:38.078 --> 59:39.997
-What is the matter?
-Nothing!

59:40.163 --> 59:42.291
Yeah? 'Cause we're going, like, a thousand...

59:42.457 --> 59:43.458
Bus!

59:47.087 --> 59:48.964
You don't know me, Wade. Okay?

59:49.131 --> 59:50.674
So stop pretending like you do.

59:50.841 --> 59:51.967
What is this about?

59:52.134 --> 59:53.010
Nothing.

59:53.177 --> 59:55.762
Everything. I don't know. It's...

01:00:00.434 --> 01:00:04.229
I don't think I actually
do want to run the shop. Okay?

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:09.151
That's what my temper
has been trying to tell me.

01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:12.738
I'm trapped.

01:00:15.824 --> 01:00:17.367
You know what's crazy?

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:20.412
Even when I was a kid,
I would pray to the Blue Flame...

01:00:20.579 --> 01:00:23.373
to be good enough
to fill my father's shoes someday...

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.584
because this place is his dream.

01:00:26.502 --> 01:00:28.462
But I never once asked...

01:00:30.214 --> 01:00:31.798
what I wanted to do.

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:39.306
I think that's because deep down,
I knew it didn't matter.

01:00:41.058 --> 01:00:44.561
Because the only way
to repay a sacrifice so big...

01:00:45.604 --> 01:00:48.148
is by sacrificing your life too.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.568
Ember!

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.320
Don't move.

01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:54.613
Oh, blaze! My mother.

01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:05.249
Mom, it's okay.
He's just a friend.

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.460
Silence!

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:12.214
I could smell you from over there.
You stink.

01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:13.590
What are you talking about?

01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:16.802
You know what I'm talking about.

01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:20.681
You're smelling love on me?

01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:24.059
If your father find out...

01:01:24.226 --> 01:01:27.980
Fire and Water cannot be together.

01:01:28.522 --> 01:01:30.732
I prove it. Come with me.

01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:35.821
I splash this on your heart
to bring love to the surface.

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:46.373
And then you must light these with your fire,
and I read the smoke.

01:01:58.677 --> 01:02:01.138
See, Ember? It cannot be.

01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:05.934
Actually...

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:09.104
What are you doing?

01:02:42.596 --> 01:02:43.430
Cinder?

01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:44.431
Who down there?

01:02:44.598 --> 01:02:46.225
It's my dad.
You have to go.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.728
Wait, are we a match?

01:02:50.312 --> 01:02:52.773
What's going on?
I wake up and nobody upstairs.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.982
It was just me.

01:02:55.484 --> 01:02:57.694
I was double-checking the locks.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:02:59.821
And Mom came down and...

01:02:59.988 --> 01:03:04.034
Yes, and we began looking at this door.

01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:05.911
We don't talk about this door enough.

01:03:06.078 --> 01:03:07.079
Pull it together.

01:03:07.246 --> 01:03:08.872
Well, since you're awake...

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:13.794
I was gonna tell you tomorrow,
but I'm too excited to sleep.

01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:16.463
In two days, I retire.

01:03:17.172 --> 01:03:18.048
Oh, Bernie.

01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:19.174
Two days?

01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:22.052
Yes. We're going to throw big party.

01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:23.595
A grand reopening.

01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:27.641
That way I can tell whole world
my daughter take over.

01:03:28.767 --> 01:03:31.353
And I have gift for you.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.356
I've had this for a while,
but after our talk...

01:03:34.523 --> 01:03:36.483
I know now is the time.

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:38.694
Before I give it to you...

01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:42.364
I need you to understand what it means to me.

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.200
When I left Fire Land...

01:03:47.286 --> 01:03:50.414
I gave my father the Bà Ksô...

01:03:51.874 --> 01:03:52.875
the big bow.

01:03:55.335 --> 01:03:57.880
It is the highest form of respect.

01:04:02.384 --> 01:04:03.468
But my father...

01:04:04.178 --> 01:04:06.471
did not return the bow.

01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:09.892
Did not give me his blessing.

01:04:10.851 --> 01:04:13.145
He say, if we leave Fire Land...

01:04:13.562 --> 01:04:15.856
we will lose who we are.

01:04:17.733 --> 01:04:19.985
They never got to see all of this.

01:04:20.152 --> 01:04:24.948
They didn't get to see
that I never forgot we are Fire.

01:04:25.115 --> 01:04:28.535
This is burden I still carry.

01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:31.288
Ember, it is important that you know...

01:04:31.455 --> 01:04:35.417
you have my blessing
every day you come in here.

01:04:35.584 --> 01:04:37.085
So I have this made for you.

01:04:39.213 --> 01:04:40.672
Wow, Àshfá.

01:04:42.174 --> 01:04:44.343
It's gonna be big, bright.

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:46.178
Everyone's gonna see this.

01:04:46.345 --> 01:04:48.347
"Ember's Fireplace."

01:04:48.514 --> 01:04:50.891
We unveil it at grand reopening.

01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:55.562
Come, Bernie.
You need your rest.

01:05:20.504 --> 01:05:23.799
Ember, so, what'd your mom say
about our reading?

01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:25.133
Nothing.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.885
Look, I have a gift for you.

01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:33.934
And you came all the way here
to give it to me?

01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:35.936
Wait, why are you giving me gifts?

01:05:37.521 --> 01:05:38.355
Oh, no.

01:05:38.564 --> 01:05:40.232
No, no, no.

01:05:40.399 --> 01:05:42.359
Hold on, I think I have
something to show you.

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:43.819
Just give me two seconds.

01:05:43.986 --> 01:05:45.571
And you're gonna need a pair of boots.

01:05:49.449 --> 01:05:51.451
Wade, what are we doing here?

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:52.828
Just wait.

01:06:01.253 --> 01:06:02.713
Why do they even have these?

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.714
Who knows?

01:06:10.929 --> 01:06:13.432
Hey, it's my favorite fireball.

01:06:13.599 --> 01:06:15.767
Hey, Gale. What's going on?

01:06:15.934 --> 01:06:18.478
I know you think you have to end this...

01:06:18.645 --> 01:06:21.815
but that flooded tunnel,
it goes to the main terminal.

01:06:21.982 --> 01:06:23.192
Okay.

01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:25.444
Do you still want to see a Vivisteria?

01:06:26.904 --> 01:06:27.738
Gale?

01:06:36.622 --> 01:06:38.999
Wait, I'm supposed to get in there?

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.209
The air should last...

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:41.960
At least 20 minutes.

01:06:44.505 --> 01:06:46.256
They said you couldn't go in there.

01:06:46.423 --> 01:06:49.593
Why does anyone get to tell you
what you can do in your life?

01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:18.205
Whoa.

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:37.993
A Vivisteria.

01:08:56.761 --> 01:08:57.763
Whoa.

01:09:26.124 --> 01:09:27.709
-Ouch.
-Hey, you're running out of air.

01:09:37.426 --> 01:09:40.471
Almost there.
Try to breathe slow and steady.

01:09:53.402 --> 01:09:54.611
I'm so sorry. I should never...

01:09:54.778 --> 01:09:55.737
Are you kidding?

01:09:55.904 --> 01:09:59.074
That was amazing!
I finally saw a Vivisteria!

01:10:00.409 --> 01:10:02.202
It was inspiring.

01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:03.579
You were inspiring.

01:10:07.624 --> 01:10:09.877
No. Wade, we can't touch.

01:10:10.043 --> 01:10:11.295
Maybe we can.

01:10:11.712 --> 01:10:12.713
No.

01:10:13.547 --> 01:10:14.882
But can't we just prove it?

01:10:15.048 --> 01:10:15.924
Prove what?

01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:17.426
Let's see what happens...

01:10:17.593 --> 01:10:20.304
and if it's a disaster,
then we'll know this would never work.

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.764
But it actually could be a disaster.

01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:26.518
I could vaporize you.
You could extinguish me, and then...

01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:29.271
Let's start small.

01:12:08.495 --> 01:12:09.997
I'm so lucky.

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:16.795
I'm so lucky I have you.

01:12:23.802 --> 01:12:24.720
I have to go.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.848
Wait, what?

01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:29.057
Where are you going?

01:12:29.141 --> 01:12:31.018
Back to my life at the shop where I belong.

01:12:31.185 --> 01:12:32.186
I take over tomorrow.

01:12:32.352 --> 01:12:33.645
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

01:12:33.812 --> 01:12:36.190
You don't want that, you said so yourself.

01:12:36.356 --> 01:12:37.691
It doesn't matter what I want.

01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:39.359
Of course it does.

01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:40.736
Listen. Listen.

01:12:40.903 --> 01:12:43.655
You've got an opportunity
to do something you want with your life.

01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:45.032
"Want"?

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:48.076
Yeah, that may work in your rich kid,
"follow your heart" family...

01:12:48.243 --> 01:12:50.621
but getting to do what you want
is a luxury...

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.372
and not for people like me.

01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:55.334
Why not?
Just tell your father how you feel.

01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:57.503
This is too important.
Maybe he'll agree.

01:12:58.754 --> 01:12:59.588
Yeah.

01:13:00.923 --> 01:13:01.840
Funny.

01:13:02.007 --> 01:13:04.801
And this whole time
I thought you were so strong...

01:13:04.968 --> 01:13:07.888
but turns out you're just afraid.

01:13:08.555 --> 01:13:10.724
Don't you dare judge me.

01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:12.059
You don't know what it's like...

01:13:12.226 --> 01:13:14.478
to have parents who gave up
everything for you.

01:13:16.188 --> 01:13:17.940
I'm Fire, Wade.

01:13:18.106 --> 01:13:19.691
I can't be anything more than that.

01:13:19.858 --> 01:13:21.902
It's what I am and what my family is.

01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:23.570
It's our way of life.

01:13:23.946 --> 01:13:27.074
I cannot throw all of that away just for you.

01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:30.077
I don't understand.

01:13:30.494 --> 01:13:33.914
And that alone is a reason
this could never work.

01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:36.124
It's over, Wade.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.241
Everyone, welcome.

01:14:09.408 --> 01:14:11.869
It is good to see your faces.

01:14:12.035 --> 01:14:15.247
I am honored to have served you...

01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:17.291
but it's time to move on.

01:14:18.166 --> 01:14:19.168
Come.

01:14:20.836 --> 01:14:22.171
My daughter...

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:24.673
you are the Ember of our family fire.

01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:31.680
That is why I am so proud
to have you take over my life's work.

01:14:42.858 --> 01:14:44.568
Pretty good trick, huh?

01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:49.907
This is lantern I bring from old country.

01:14:50.991 --> 01:14:53.744
Today, I pass it on to you.

01:15:04.129 --> 01:15:05.506
I thought of other reasons.

01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:11.720
Wade?

01:15:13.096 --> 01:15:13.931
Oh, boy.

01:15:14.348 --> 01:15:15.516
What are you doing here?

01:15:15.682 --> 01:15:18.519
You said me not understanding
is the reason we can never work.

01:15:18.685 --> 01:15:21.313
But I thought of other reasons.
A bunch of 'em.

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:24.441
Like, number one, you're Fire, I'm Water.

01:15:24.608 --> 01:15:26.318
I mean, come on, that's crazy.

01:15:26.485 --> 01:15:27.694
Right?

01:15:27.861 --> 01:15:29.988
-Who is this?
-No idea.

01:15:30.155 --> 01:15:32.157
Number two, I'm crashing your party.

01:15:32.324 --> 01:15:33.909
Like, what kind of a jerk am I?

01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:35.786
-A pretty big one.
-Right?

01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:40.290
Number three,
I can't eat your delicious foods.

01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:43.961
Very unpleasant.

01:15:44.378 --> 01:15:47.047
Wait, I know him.
He is food inspector.

01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:50.801
Oh, right. Number four,
I'm banned from your father's shop.

01:15:51.301 --> 01:15:54.596
There are a million reasons
why this can't work.

01:15:54.763 --> 01:15:56.056
A million nos.

01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:58.433
But there's also one yes...

01:15:58.725 --> 01:15:59.560
we touched.

01:16:00.519 --> 01:16:02.646
And when we did, something happened to us...

01:16:02.813 --> 01:16:03.856
something impossible.

01:16:05.399 --> 01:16:07.150
We changed each other's chemistry.

01:16:07.609 --> 01:16:08.443
Enough!

01:16:08.819 --> 01:16:10.821
What kind of food inspection is this?

01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:12.823
A food inspection of the heart, sir.

01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.949
Who are you?

01:16:14.116 --> 01:16:17.661
Just a guy who burst into your
daughter's life in a flooded old basement.

01:16:17.828 --> 01:16:19.830
So you are the one who burst the pipes?

01:16:19.997 --> 01:16:21.415
What? Not me. It was...

01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:24.126
You?

01:16:25.002 --> 01:16:26.461
You burst the pipe?

01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:27.629
-I...
-Ember.

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:29.298
-Silence!
-No!

01:16:29.464 --> 01:16:30.716
Take the chance.

01:16:30.883 --> 01:16:32.801
Let your father know who you really are.

01:16:35.846 --> 01:16:37.556
Look, I had regrets when my dad died.

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:41.768
But because of you, I learned
to embrace the light while it burns.

01:16:42.186 --> 01:16:43.061
Tìshók.

01:16:43.896 --> 01:16:46.481
You don't have forever
to say what you need to say.

01:16:47.649 --> 01:16:49.526
I love you, Ember Lumen.

01:16:53.071 --> 01:16:55.157
And I'm pretty sure you love me too.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:01.288
No, Wade, I don't.

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:06.877
That's not true.
I did their reading.

01:17:07.377 --> 01:17:10.589
Bernie, it's love.
It's true love.

01:17:10.964 --> 01:17:12.549
No, Mom, you're wrong.

01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:13.675
Wade, go.

01:17:13.842 --> 01:17:14.760
But, Ember...

01:17:14.927 --> 01:17:16.512
I don't love you.

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:19.556
Go!

01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:37.115
You have been seeing Water?

01:17:37.282 --> 01:17:38.325
Àshfá, I...

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:40.285
You caused leak in shop?

01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:43.455
I trusted you.

01:17:44.164 --> 01:17:46.959
You will not take over the shop.

01:17:49.044 --> 01:17:50.629
I no longer retire.

01:18:40.012 --> 01:18:43.140
Why can't I just be a good daughter?

01:19:19.301 --> 01:19:20.302
Firetown.

01:19:24.223 --> 01:19:26.225
Well, one-way ticket to anywhere but here.

01:19:26.391 --> 01:19:28.143
Go. Travel the world.

01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:30.229
Heal that broken heart.

01:19:30.395 --> 01:19:33.565
My little drip, drip baby boy.

01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:38.695
Drip, drip, drip, goes the baby boy

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:41.156
I made you a painting.

01:19:41.323 --> 01:19:43.450
It's of a lonely man...

01:19:43.617 --> 01:19:45.244
awash in sadness.

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:52.751
Ember.

01:20:00.342 --> 01:20:01.510
Mom, Dad!

01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:22.239
Water's coming!

01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:24.241
Watch out!

01:20:24.408 --> 01:20:25.409
Behind you!

01:20:26.326 --> 01:20:27.578
Climb! Climb!

01:20:27.911 --> 01:20:29.621
Flash flood! Hurry!

01:20:30.205 --> 01:20:31.415
Mom, water!

01:20:31.582 --> 01:20:32.666
Get to higher ground!

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:34.126
Bernie!

01:20:48.473 --> 01:20:49.433
The flame!

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.684
Let me go!

01:20:54.188 --> 01:20:55.189
Ember, no!

01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:16.752
-Wade?
-Keyhole.

01:21:22.466 --> 01:21:24.551
I was hoping to make a more heroic entrance.

01:21:24.718 --> 01:21:27.137
You came back, after everything I said.

01:21:27.304 --> 01:21:28.972
Are you kidding? And miss all this?

01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:33.435
Hold the door.

01:21:47.324 --> 01:21:48.617
No! No.

01:21:48.784 --> 01:21:49.701
No, no, no.

01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:57.334
Ember, we have to go!

01:21:57.835 --> 01:21:59.211
We have to go now!

01:21:59.378 --> 01:22:00.546
I can't leave.

01:22:00.712 --> 01:22:04.341
I'm sorry to say this, but the shop is done.
The flame is done.

01:22:04.508 --> 01:22:08.178
No! This is my father's whole life.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:22:14.726 --> 01:22:15.561
Throw me that lantern.

01:22:25.988 --> 01:22:26.864
No.

01:22:29.825 --> 01:22:31.076
No, no, no.

01:22:32.828 --> 01:22:34.121
Oh, Wade.

01:22:34.288 --> 01:22:35.706
Thank you, thank you.

01:22:59.605 --> 01:23:00.772
It's too hot in here.

01:23:03.233 --> 01:23:04.234
Climb!

01:23:13.035 --> 01:23:14.244
Back up! Back up!

01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:29.843
-I have to open that up.
-No!

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:32.262
The water will come in
and you'll be snuffed out.

01:23:32.429 --> 01:23:35.432
But you're evaporating.
I don't know what to do.

01:23:35.849 --> 01:23:36.725
It's okay.

01:23:36.892 --> 01:23:38.477
No, it's not okay!

01:23:47.611 --> 01:23:48.445
Ember...

01:23:48.862 --> 01:23:50.405
I have no regrets.

01:23:50.572 --> 01:23:53.116
You gave me something
people search for their whole lives.

01:23:53.283 --> 01:23:56.203
But I can't exist in a world without you.

01:23:57.913 --> 01:23:59.998
I'm sorry I didn't say it before.

01:24:01.542 --> 01:24:03.085
I love you, Wade.

01:24:10.634 --> 01:24:13.762
I really do love it
when your light does that.

01:24:31.321 --> 01:24:32.573
They're in the hearth!

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:42.749
Wade is gone.

01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:45.169
Oh, my daughter.

01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:47.421
He saved me.

01:25:01.727 --> 01:25:02.853
Dad...

01:25:04.188 --> 01:25:06.064
this is all my fault.

01:25:07.482 --> 01:25:08.817
The shop...

01:25:10.819 --> 01:25:11.987
Wade.

01:25:15.991 --> 01:25:18.368
I need to tell you the truth.

01:25:19.244 --> 01:25:21.330
I don't want to run the shop.

01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:26.293
I know that was your dream,
but it's not mine.

01:25:27.336 --> 01:25:28.921
I'm sorry.

01:25:30.088 --> 01:25:31.798
I'm a bad daughter.

01:25:41.517 --> 01:25:42.684
Ember...

01:25:42.976 --> 01:25:45.604
the shop was never the dream.

01:25:45.771 --> 01:25:47.981
You were the dream.

01:25:48.148 --> 01:25:50.609
You were always the dream.

01:25:58.492 --> 01:26:00.244
I loved him, Dad.

01:26:32.234 --> 01:26:33.652
Butterfly.

01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:40.492
Butterfly. Windshield wipers.
Half a butterfly.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.879
An old man on his deathbed
remembers the summer he fell in love.

01:26:58.594 --> 01:27:00.429
She was out of his league...

01:27:00.596 --> 01:27:03.390
and he was young and scared.

01:27:03.557 --> 01:27:06.935
He let her go, thinking surely
summer would come again.

01:27:07.477 --> 01:27:08.729
It never did.

01:27:12.983 --> 01:27:15.777
You are perfect match. Ten out of ten.

01:27:18.572 --> 01:27:20.282
I don't understand.
What's going on?

01:27:20.449 --> 01:27:23.160
Just say something
to make Water guy cry, okay?

01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:27.372
You are no longer panned.

01:27:28.081 --> 01:27:29.208
Banned.

01:27:29.374 --> 01:27:30.292
Banned.

01:27:32.294 --> 01:27:35.589
I want to explore the world with you,
Wade Ripple.

01:27:35.756 --> 01:27:38.258
I want to have you with me in my life.

01:27:38.425 --> 01:27:39.468
Forever.

01:27:54.483 --> 01:27:57.444
Your chimney needs cleaning.

01:28:20.509 --> 01:28:24.429
I knew it. My nose always knows.

01:28:37.901 --> 01:28:41.530
If you were a vegetable,
you'd be a cute-cumber.

01:28:42.698 --> 01:28:44.116
My queen.

01:28:45.409 --> 01:28:48.662
I can't believe I was gonna
shut this place down.

01:28:49.705 --> 01:28:50.706
Sorry.

01:28:51.623 --> 01:28:54.209
Fern, you're a Windbreakers fan?

01:28:54.543 --> 01:28:55.627
Toot toot.

01:28:56.086 --> 01:28:58.130
Toot toot.

01:28:58.297 --> 01:29:01.091
Oy, you know what I like best
about running this shop?

01:29:01.258 --> 01:29:03.844
Not having to eat Bernie's kol-nuts?

01:29:04.887 --> 01:29:09.349
Sorry, I couldn't hear you
through my retirement.

01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:36.084
Hey!

01:29:36.251 --> 01:29:38.045
-Hi, Wade.
-Hey, Wade! Yo, yo, yo!

01:29:39.379 --> 01:29:41.548
Ember, it's time.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.057
You know, I'm not really
one for tearful goodbyes.

01:29:50.807 --> 01:29:51.642
Wade.

01:29:52.309 --> 01:29:54.311
You big liar.

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:57.439
Drip, drip, drip

01:29:57.606 --> 01:29:59.775
Goes the baby boy

01:30:04.655 --> 01:30:06.490
Are you sure about this one?

01:30:06.657 --> 01:30:07.741
I'm sure.

01:30:08.575 --> 01:30:09.451
Dad...

01:30:09.826 --> 01:30:12.329
I'm sorry the internship is so far away.

01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:14.957
I mean, it's the best glass design company
in the world...

01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:16.750
but who knows if it'll become a real job.

01:30:16.917 --> 01:30:18.085
I'll be back in a few months anyway...

01:30:18.252 --> 01:30:19.628
and it might not end up being anything...

01:30:20.838 --> 01:30:22.381
Go, start new life.

01:30:22.548 --> 01:30:24.383
Your mother and I will be here.

01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:26.969
Now, with more time for hanky-panky.

01:31:49.426 --> 01:31:54.598
Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where I was gonna go next

01:31:54.765 --> 01:31:59.811
Didn't know until I saw your face
I was missin' out on every moment

01:31:59.978 --> 01:32:05.442
You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?

01:32:06.485 --> 01:32:08.403
I'm into you

01:32:09.154 --> 01:32:15.369
So if it's real,
then, darlin', let me know

01:32:19.498 --> 01:32:25.754
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show

01:32:46.608 --> 01:32:51.613
You and I, we go together
You're the sky, I'll be the weather

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:55.117
A pretty thing, the sun and rain
Who knew?

01:32:55.284 --> 01:32:56.869
Oh, yeah

01:32:57.035 --> 01:33:03.125
Summer night, perfect occasion
Where am I? You know I'll be waitin' for you

01:33:04.459 --> 01:33:06.253
Oh, for you

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:10.549
So if it's real, then, darlin'

01:33:10.674 --> 01:33:12.509
let me know

01:33:16.597 --> 01:33:22.936
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show

01:33:26.982 --> 01:33:33.238
So if it's real,
then, darlin', let me know

01:33:37.576 --> 01:33:43.081
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show

01:33:43.248 --> 01:33:45.626
You shine

01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:50.464
You shine, like forever

01:33:50.631 --> 01:33:51.840
Lasts forever

01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:59.306
You shine, you shine,
and steal the show

01:34:03.268 --> 01:34:09.566
So if it's real,
then, darlin', let me know

01:34:13.695 --> 01:34:20.035
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show

01:34:20.202 --> 01:34:22.955
Started out on a one-way train

01:34:23.121 --> 01:34:25.290
-Always knew where I was gonna go next.
-So if it's real

01:34:25.457 --> 01:34:27.209
Didn't know until I saw your face

01:34:27.376 --> 01:34:30.420
Then, darlin', let me know

01:34:30.587 --> 01:34:34.591
You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?

01:34:34.758 --> 01:34:41.139
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show
