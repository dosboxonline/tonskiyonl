02:45.240 --> 02:47.834
Lee: Teacher. - Hm_

02:49.720 --> 02:54.191
I see your talents have gone
beyond the mere physical level.

02:54.360 --> 02:58.433
Your skills are now at the point
of spiritual insight.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.034
I have questions: What is the highest
technique you hope to achieve?

03:03.200 --> 03:05.873
- To have no technique.
- Very good.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.554
What are your thoughts
when facing an opponent?

03:08.720 --> 03:10.438
There is no opponent.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.113
And why is that?

03:12.320 --> 03:16.438
Because the word "I" does not exist

03:16.600 --> 03:20.070
so. Continue.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.111
A good fight should be...

03:24.560 --> 03:29.839
Llke a small play, but played seriously.

03:30.360 --> 03:35.434
A good martial artist
does not become tense, but ready.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.076
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.754
Ready for whatever may come.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.873
When the opponent expand, I contract.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.429
When he contracts, I expand.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.160
And when there is an opportunity...

03:51.240 --> 03:53.470
I do not hit.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.360
It hits all by itself.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.114
Now, you must remember...

04:00.280 --> 04:04.273
The enemy has only images
and illusions.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.955
Behind which he hides his true motives.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.795
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.

04:11.960 --> 04:17.432
The "it" that you refer to
is a powerful weapon...

04:17.640 --> 04:23.749
Easily misused by the martial artist
who deserts his vows.

04:24.080 --> 04:29.234
For centuries now, the code
of the Shaolin temple has been preserved.

04:29.440 --> 04:35.072
Remember, the honor of our brotherhood
has been held true.

04:36.160 --> 04:40.278
Tell me now the Shaolin commandment
number 13.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.435
"A martial artist has to take
responsibility for himself.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.354
And accept the consequences
of his own doing."

04:51.880 --> 04:53.996
I'm ashamed to tell you now...

04:54.160 --> 04:57.869
Among all the Shaolin men
I have taught...

04:58.360 --> 05:02.239
There 1s one who has turned
the ways of knowledge and strength...

05:02.400 --> 05:05.233
To his own base ends.

05:06.160 --> 05:10.358
He has perverted all we hold sacred.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.560
His name is han.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.749
In defiance of all our beliefs

05:20.160 --> 05:23.869
ne has brought disgrace
to the Shaolin temple.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.874
So it is now for you to reclaim
our lost honor.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.157
Yes I understand.

05:33.320 --> 05:37.313
There is a man here.
You will go to him.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.073
Braithwaite: Hello, Mr. Lee.
My name's braithwaite.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.390
Hello, Mr. braithwaite.

05:50.720 --> 05:54.918
I've come to speak to you
about a matter of great importance.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.032
- Have some tea?
- Yes, indeed.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.516
This is very pleasant.

06:11.680 --> 06:16.071
Mr. Lee, I've come to speak to you
about a tournament of martial arts.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.193
A tournament to which
you've received an invitation.

06:19.920 --> 06:23.515
Specifically, a tournament
organized by Mr. han.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.157
- Han's tournament.
- I know, I know, I know.

06:28.320 --> 06:32.836
But we'd very much like you to attend
that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.749
"We," Mr. braithwaite?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.916
It's I. Ao's time.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.071
Yes, of course.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.918
Kick me.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.198
Kick me.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.114
What was that? An exhibition?

07:10.400 --> 07:14.791
We need emotional content.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.112
Try again.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.631
I said, emotional content, not anger.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.475
Now, try again. With me.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.597
That's it.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.151
How did it feel to you?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.989
I et me think

07:57.160 --> 08:00.470
don't think. Feel

08:00.640 --> 08:05.031
it is like a finger pointing
a way to the moon.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.759
Don't concentrate on the finger...

08:08.920 --> 08:13.357
Or you will miss all
that heavenly glory.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.714
Do you understand?

08:20.200 --> 08:25.593
Never take your eyes off your opponent,
even when you bow.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.876
That's it.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.353
There.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.037
That's han. That's the only film
we have on him.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.270
We know he was a member
of your temple.

10:59.440 --> 11:03.274
A Shaolin monk, now a renegade.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.790
That's oharra behind him.
Personal bodyguard.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.192
Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,
being han's bodyguard.

11:13.280 --> 11:16.397
We got our hands
on a demonstration film of oharra.

11:16.640 --> 11:20.838
All real bricks and boards,
nothing phony about any of it.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.993
This was before he picked up
a facial scar somewhere

11:35.520 --> 11:38.034
This is where you'll be going.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.159
An island fortress, really.

11:41.320 --> 11:47.077
After the war, the nationality
of the island was uncertain.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.949
And sometime after that, han bought it.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.712
What do you know about han?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.236
He lives like a king on that island.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.233
Totally self-sufficient.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.197
All of his efforts, seemingly...

12:00.360 --> 12:06.469
Are directed toward supporting
what he calls his "school of martial arts."

12:06.640 --> 12:09.950
Han's only contact with the outside world
is this tournament.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.031
Which he holds every three years.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.878
Braithwaite: This was a stewardess,
Mary king, found floating in the harbor.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.719
Nothing unusual about a body
in the harbor

12:20.880 --> 12:25.078
but this girl was last seen at a party
aboard han's private junk.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.391
They'd reported her lost at sea
before the body was found.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.230
We believe he selects attractive girls...

12:31.400 --> 12:34.073
Methodically builds
their dependence on drugs...

12:34.240 --> 12:37.710
Then sells them to an elite clientele
around the world.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.758
Lee: What did the autopsy reveal
as the cause of death?

12:40.920 --> 12:44.071
Braithwaite: She did not drown.
Lee: She od'd?

12:44.280 --> 12:46.236
Uh

12:49.720 --> 12:54.589
Yes. Cause of death
was heroin overdose.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.593
You still don't have enough
to bust up his operation.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.954
We know everything.
We can prove nothing.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.114
We want you to go in there as our agent.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.716
- Get us our evidence.
- And get out in one piece to give it to you.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.588
We'll give you anything you need.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.394
Electronic equipment, weapons,
anything.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.194
- Drink??
- No, thanks.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.759
(Suns.

13:20.960 --> 13:25.078
Now, why doesn't somebody
pull out a .45 and bang, settle it?

13:25.240 --> 13:27.549
Braithwaite: No. No guns.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.629
Look at this map here.

13:31.920 --> 13:36.994
As you know, the possession
of a weapon is a serious offense here.

13:37.200 --> 13:43.036
Han's island rests partly
within our territorial waters.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.954
If we had the slightest reason to
believe he has any kind of arsenal...

13:47.160 --> 13:48.559
We'd move in on him.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.429
Besides, han would never allow guns
on the island anyway.

13:52.640 --> 13:57.156
He had a bad experience with them once
and he's fearful of assassination.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.757
You can't really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.230
I guess I won't need anything.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.718
There's a radio on the island.
We'll monitor it.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.791
On the chance you can get to it.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.479
And then you come?

14:12.840 --> 14:14.831
- Someone will.
- Oh.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.230
We aren't an agency of enforcement.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.519
We function as gatherers
of information, evidence.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.951
Upon which interested
governments can act.

14:25.160 --> 14:29.676
I see. If there's any trouble,
you make a phone call.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.035
Braithwaite:
Oh, by the way, two months ago...

14:32.240 --> 14:36.631
We managed to place a female
operative on the island.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.990
Since then, we've lost her.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.510
If she's there, she might have something.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.315
Name's Mel ling.

14:44.480 --> 14:48.678
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.

15:27.280 --> 15:31.796
Lee's father: But now the time has
come to tell you something very difficult.

15:32.280 --> 15:37.035
I'm happy you have decided to go
to han's tournament.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.197
Yeah

15:39.720 --> 15:44.350
the last of the tournaments
were held three years ago.

15:44.520 --> 15:49.674
I was in the city with your sister
at that time.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.110
I didn't know that.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.434
Yes

15:57.280 --> 16:00.272
Lee's father: Many of han's men
had come in from the island.

16:00.440 --> 16:04.797
They were everywhere,
bullying and arrogant.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.111
We were on our way into town.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.354
Lee's father: Stay back!

16:40.960 --> 16:42.359
Run! Run!

16:43.640 --> 16:45.358
Now!

20:07.360 --> 20:10.158
Lee's father:
Now you know the truth.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.716
When you get to the city...

20:12.880 --> 20:17.874
Pay your respects to your sister
and your mother.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.716
I will, old man.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.672
You will not agree with
what I am going to do.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.755
It is contrary to all
that you have taught me...

20:54.920 --> 20:57.912
And all that su lin believed

21:06.160 --> 21:08.435
I must leave.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.430
Please try to find a way to forgive me.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.231
Roper: Double or nothing?

22:23.320 --> 22:25.515
Golfer:
That's about 1000 bucks a foot, roper.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.517
Why not?

22:46.040 --> 22:50.716
I'm sorry, Mr. roper isn't in right now.
May I take a message?

23:13.760 --> 23:16.558
Man:
That's a tough shot, Mr. roper.

23:19.400 --> 23:22.551
Uh, excuse me, fellas.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.358
- I say he can't make it.
- What'll you bet?

23:27.560 --> 23:29.039
You gotta love him.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.320
Come on, roper.
It's 175 big ones by Monday the 15th.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.710
Only 150.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.357
You forget interest.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.793
- Maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.
- You take advantage, roper.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.799
Come on, fellas.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.798
It's the dough, roper,
or we gotta break something.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.919
You got it?

23:54.760 --> 23:56.910
Freddie says this is for your own good.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.592
Better confirm that flight
to Hong Kong for me.

24:24.960 --> 24:30.114
- How much do I have left in the bank?
Secretary: $63.43.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.596
It's all yours. Thanks.

24:33.760 --> 24:37.196
Secretary: Only, I think you'll need it.
You wanna bet?

26:09.440 --> 26:11.556
Double-punching. Ready...

26:43.920 --> 26:46.593
Officer 1:
Going on a trip, are you?

26:53.880 --> 26:58.556
- Hey, this jig's got a passport.
- Where you going, jig?

27:00.120 --> 27:04.750
- Where's the plane ticket for?
- Hong Kong, via Hawaii.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.231
He's not going to Hawaii.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.753
Officer 2:
Well, look what we got here!

27:12.920 --> 27:15.639
Assaulting a police officer.

28:05.440 --> 28:09.149
- Hey, soldier, shape it up!
- Roper! Hey, how are you, man?

28:09.360 --> 28:13.353
How am I, man? How am I?
I'm glad to see you, that's how I am.

28:13.560 --> 28:17.189
- Hey, how long has it been? Five...?
- Six years, man.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.191
- Six.
- It's not as long as it seems.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.839
Yeah, I know what you mean.

28:21.040 --> 28:24.794
- What you been doing since nam?
- Hanging in a little bit.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.070
- All these yours?
- Always first-class.

28:27.240 --> 28:30.949
Same old roper. Huh.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.718
Come here.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.112
Williams: Parsons.
Roper: Yeah, from New Zealand.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.158
This man's putting
quite a collection together.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.192
Williams: Know him?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.397
Roper:
Uh-uh. Never saw him before.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.870
What do you know about this han cat?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.714
Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.396
They don't live so big over there.

29:03.560 --> 29:06.074
(Shettos are the same all over the world.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.549
They stink.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.877
Same old Williams.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.238
Yeah

30:39.960 --> 30:42.076
Roper:
What have we got here? A little action.

30:42.240 --> 30:46.756
Insects. Okay, I'll lay you 50 bucks
on the big one.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.993
Fifty. $50 on the big one, all right?

30:50.160 --> 30:51.752
I'll give you 5-to-1.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.079
Would you bet 1007

30:55.960 --> 30:57.234
you're on.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.832
Roper: Come on,
let's end this thing quickly. Whoa!

31:09.520 --> 31:11.988
Thattababy. Come on. Come on!

31:12.880 --> 31:16.873
That's it. Just get him on his back.
Get him on his back! Come on.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.476
Come on. Give up! Come on! Hey.

31:21.040 --> 31:25.636
Oh, for crying out loud.
Would you believe that?

31:29.040 --> 31:31.270
Dumb shit.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.197
Parsons: Do I bother you?

32:25.760 --> 32:27.751
Don't waste yourself.

32:29.200 --> 32:32.749
- What's your style?
- My style?

32:33.760 --> 32:36.593
You can call it the art of fighting
without fighting.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.428
"The art of fighting without fighting"?

32:40.280 --> 32:42.396
Parsons: Show me some of it.
- I ater

32:49.720 --> 32:51.438
All right.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.117
Don't you think we need more room?

32:57.480 --> 32:58.754
Where else?

32:59.960 --> 33:04.909
That island, on the beach.
We can take this boat.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.232
Okay.

33:27.480 --> 33:31.155
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, are you crazy?

33:33.360 --> 33:36.079
Parsons: Pull me in! Pull me in!

33:37.840 --> 33:42.436
Don't try to pull yourself up
or I'll let go of the line.

34:42.159 --> 34:45.038
Mm. Would you look at that?

34:49.000 --> 34:53.197
A woman like that could teach you
a lot about yourself.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.398
Welcome.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.637
This way.

36:20.640 --> 36:24.519
I'll show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.831
I think you'll find our little island
quite charming.

38:24.960 --> 38:29.078
Say, I hope you haven't spent all
that money you won from me yesterday.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.800
- I plan to win it back.
- Oh? How?

38:33.160 --> 38:35.913
You'll find out, after you've lost it.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.711
You seem to be very much
at home here, Mr. roper.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.317
This guy han's got a great sense
of hospitality.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.233
And a fantastic sense of style.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.952
Yeah, it's great.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.997
Then why are you so apprehensive?

38:52.240 --> 38:53.958
Apprehensive?

38:55.000 --> 38:58.959
No. I was just wondering
whether it was okay to drink the water.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.836
Mr. roper, don't con me.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.314
Wanna bet?

39:12.080 --> 39:14.196
Williams: Hmm.

39:14.720 --> 39:19.111
No. I really don't think so. Thanks.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.511
What's the matter, you on a diet?

39:21.680 --> 39:25.195
I'd like to eat, if I could
find something I could keep down.

39:25.920 --> 39:30.835
Well, I can't wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his b parties.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.352
You ever been to
a martial arts tournament like this?

39:35.360 --> 39:37.237
Never.

39:37.400 --> 39:40.710
I have a funny feeling we're being
fattened up for the kill.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.110
Better keep an eye out for the referee.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.714
Know what I mean? Yeah

40:23.560 --> 40:26.757
Gentlemen, welcome.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.434
You honor our island.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.271
I look forward to a tournament...

40:33.480 --> 40:36.790
Of truly epic proportions.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.708
We are unique, gentlemen...

40:39.880 --> 40:42.997
In that we create ourselves.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.033
Through long years
of rigorous training...

40:46.240 --> 40:49.198
Sacrifice, denial, pain.

40:49.360 --> 40:54.434
We forge our bodies
in the fire of our will

40:54.600 --> 40:57.910
but tonight, let us celebrate.

40:58.080 --> 41:03.916
Gentlemen, you have our gratitude.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.037
Tania: Mr. Williams.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.473
Mr. Williams!

42:33.280 --> 42:35.111
For me?

42:38.360 --> 42:40.191
You shouldn't have.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.672
But

42:44.400 --> 42:46.550
I'll take you, darling.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.038
And you.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.551
And you.

42:56.920 --> 43:00.230
And you.

43:03.560 --> 43:06.916
Please understand, if I missed anyone...

43:07.240 --> 43:09.470
It's been a big day.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.238
I'm a little tired.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.438
Oh, of course, Mr. Williams.

43:15.920 --> 43:19.230
You must conserve your strength.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.512
Come in.

43:28.360 --> 43:30.828
Tania: A gift, Mr. Lee.

43:39.120 --> 43:43.272
- If you don't see anything you like...
- There was a girl at the feast tonight.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.759
Which girl, sir?

43:46.400 --> 43:47.958
The owner of this dart.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.951
Oh, yes. I know the one.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.119
I'll send her to you.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.639
Another fine mess you got me into.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.792
Come in.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.318
Hi

44:28.160 --> 44:30.754
Roper:
Well, well, one more lovely than the next.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.797
What did you have in mind?

44:33.080 --> 44:34.832
Pick one.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.630
I already have.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.956
Wise decision.

44:56.520 --> 44:59.956
I wanna talk to you, Mei ling.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.272
Where do you come from?

45:03.440 --> 45:05.954
- Braithwaite...
- Shh, shh. Let's be quiet.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.468
Have you seen anything?

45:07.760 --> 45:12.151
Nothing much.
I'm kept in the palace, watched always.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.711
I know nothing of han's activities
away from the palace.

45:16.200 --> 45:18.953
But I can tell you this: People disappear.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.351
- Who?
- The girls. Every one of them.

45:22.560 --> 45:26.792
They're summoned to han's at night
and the next day they're gone.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.470
I know I don't have much time.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.629
You must attend the morning ritual
in uniform.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.711
Outside.

46:11.160 --> 46:14.436
Mr. Lee, why you no wear uniform?

47:13.640 --> 47:16.313
Han:
Gentlemen, let the tournament begin!

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Bolo.

48:55.160 --> 48:58.038
(Good work. You made me some bread.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.433
Man: Mr. roper. - I'm ready.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.272
Man: Okay.

49:04.440 --> 49:07.591
I got myself a real pigeon here.

49:07.760 --> 49:10.399
Keep the action going for me, will you?

49:10.760 --> 49:12.432
What do you think, roper?

49:12.600 --> 49:17.958
Oh, no sweat.
Give my friend 8-to-3 all the way.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.628
I'm finding out about myself.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.873
This is the real me, definitely.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.073
Tania: Do you like it here?

51:16.240 --> 51:18.390
Roper:
Oh, yeah. But a little lower.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.231
No I mean here on the island.

51:22.720 --> 51:26.076
Yeah, I like it here.
But a little lower.

51:26.240 --> 51:28.754
A man like you belongs here.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.558
Roper:
To you, I'm just another pretty face.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.110
Where you go?

52:12.280 --> 52:13.759
Out in the moonlight, baby.

52:14.120 --> 52:18.557
- It is not allowed. You must stay.
- Oh?

52:19.120 --> 52:21.076
Goodbye.

58:01.600 --> 58:02.794
Huh.

58:02.960 --> 58:04.632
A human fly.

58:08.280 --> 58:09.872
Han: Gentlemen.

58:10.400 --> 58:12.868
It seems that one of you...

58:13.440 --> 58:16.432
Was not content last night...

58:17.000 --> 58:21.152
With the hospitality of the palace...

58:22.320 --> 58:27.997
And sought diversion
elsewhere on the island.

58:28.680 --> 58:32.798
Who it was is not important...

58:32.960 --> 58:34.996
At this time.

58:35.520 --> 58:38.671
What is important is that...

58:39.240 --> 58:45.156
My guards performed
their duties incompetently.

58:45.400 --> 58:48.198
And now they must prove...

58:48.360 --> 58:53.354
Themselves worthy
to remain among us.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.633
Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.075
Only at how sloppy your man works.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.708
Mr Lee?

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.756
Are you ready?

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.437
Boards don't hit back.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.113
- Bolo.
- Go!

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.599
Oharral

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.313
Han: Oharral

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.035
Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.233
If you wanna talk about this thing,
I'll be in my room.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.231
(Sotcha.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.314
Williams? Williams.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.029
- Go to han's study as soon as possible.
- All right.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.039
Williams: Hey, roper.
I'll see you in half an hour.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.838
Roper: Right.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.192
- Mr. han?
- You fought well yesterday.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.590
Your style is unorthodox.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.274
But effective

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.594
it is not the art,
but the combat that you enjoy.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.557
The winning.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.880
We are all ready to win...

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.874
Just as we are born
knowing only life.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:11.554
It is defeat that you must learn
to prepare for.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.477
I don't waste my time with it.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.632
When it comes, I won't even notice.

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.399
Oh? How so?

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.634
I'll be too busy looking good.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.752
What were you looking for
when you attacked my guards?

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.839
Wasn't me.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.630
You were the only man
outside the palace.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.234
I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.751
You will tell me who else.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.473
Mr. han, suddenly
I'd like to leave your island.

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.758
- It is not possible.
- Bullshit, Mr. han-man!

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.914
Man, you come right out of
a comic book.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.309
Been practicing, huh?

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.877
Roper: Williams is expecting me.
Han: I wanted to talk to you.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.952
We will meet your friend Williams later.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.630
- Okay.
- This is my museum.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:26.233
It is difficult
to associate these horrors.

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:29.312
With the proud civilizations
that created them:

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:34.679
Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe,
the samurai.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:38.627
They worship strength
because it is strength...

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.837
That makes all other values possible.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.032
Nothing survives without it.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.631
Who knows what delicate wonders
have died out of the world.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.678
For want of the strength to survive.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.671
Roper: What's this?

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.918
Oh.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.191
A souvenir.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.475
- Up here.
Roper: A guillotine? No, thanks.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.200
This is the only angle I care
to see it from.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.874
If you please, Mr. roper.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.630
You want me to put my head
on that thing?

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.471
An act of faith

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.194
I'm a man of little faith, Mr. han.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.877
Very few people can be totally ruthless.
It isn't easy.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.759
It takes more strength
than you might believe.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.195
Now you've got eight more.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.674
Then there is a point
you will not go beyond.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.631
Faked out again.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.636
This way.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.316
Our power plant.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.954
Roper: Oh, yeah.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.552
A lifetime of women, huh?

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.314
A man's strength
can be measured by his appetites.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.314
Indeed, a man's strength flows
from his appetites.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.836
Oh, no. They are my daughters.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.751
Your daughters?

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.950
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that...
I misunderstood miss han?

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.230
And also,
they are my most personal guard.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.790
I admire your judgment.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.669
Nobody's as loyal as daddy's little girl.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.789
Woman: Mr. roper?
- Uh, no, thanks.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.878
I'll get up myself.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.033
Nice meeting you.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.476
Opium.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.791
Uh-oh.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.392
We are investing in corruption, Mr. roper.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.030
The business of corruption
is like any other.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.554
Oh, yeah.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.629
Provide your customers
with products they need...

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.759
And encourage that need a little bit
to stimulate your market...

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.515
Pretty soon your customers
depend on you. I mean, really need you.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.716
It's the law of economics.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.558
Right.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.713
And here we are stimulating
quite another need.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.759
You wonder why I am exposing
so much of myself?

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.230
I forget what I see very easily.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.112
But then, why are you?

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:16.235
I'm hoping you'll join us,
represent us in the United States.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.593
I'm beginning to understand the thing
with the tournament. The whole setup.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.589
It's a great way
to recruit new talent, huh?

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.437
And who are they?

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.113
The refuse found in waterfront bars.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.911
Shanghaied?

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.318
Han: Just lost, drunken men...

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.758
Wwho no longer care where
they find themselves each morning.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.158
You left some rather
sizable debts in America.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.875
Diners club hasn't called in my card yet.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.673
Oh, sh...

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.669
There were some questions
which I was forced to ask.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.110
I got no answers.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.669
And you want me to join this?

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.036
There are certain realities.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.512
I want us to have a clear understanding.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.472
No

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.188
There's no misunderstanding between us.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.670
Help me. Help, I'm 17!

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.794
I'm from California.
Help me! Please, help me!

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.959
Mister, come back, please!
You have to come back please!

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:36.353
- Help me! Help me!
Nurse: Hey, quiet! Shut up!

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.712
Han: The battle with the guards
was magnificent.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.437
Your skill is extraordinary.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:42.072
And I was going to ask you to join us.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.471
My god. This came in half an hour ago.
Why didn't I...?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.992
Hello. Put your colonel on.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.751
Well, wake him up.

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.396
I don't care if he's not alone.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:19.710
Damn it all, I don't care who he's with!
You bloody well put him on the line!

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:50.111
Good morning, Mr. roper.
We have been waiting for you.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.473
What's going on?

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.918
Would you be good enough to participate
in this morning's edification?

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.514
Edification.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.278
What are you gonna do to him?

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:09.830
Not me, Mr. roper. You.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.437
Bolo?

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.551
Like you said...

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.349
There's a point I won't go beyond.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.870
I was right about you.

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.358
We shall strive to be worthy
of your sense of grandeur.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.996
I will find someone with whom
you can fight.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.673
Bolo.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.840
In english:
Quick, go destroy them. Kill!

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.791
Han: Kill them!

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.874
Han: Kill! Fools!

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:05.236
You have offended my family
and you have offended a Shaolin temple.

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.036
Lee's teacher: Remember

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:39.317
the enemy has only images
and illusions.

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.792
Behind which
he hides his true motives.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:49.274
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.
