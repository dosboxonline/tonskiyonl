04:20.927 --> 04:22.594
She must be killed!

04:28.977 --> 04:31.395
She was chosen
to bear his child.

04:31.688 --> 04:35.065
If she lives to bring about the End
of Days, there'll be no redemption.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.067
All our souls will perish.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.217
Thomas.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.746
Okay, now, give me a big push.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.581
That's it, that's it.
You're doing great.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.208
You're doing great. That's it.
Okay, stop pushing.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.210
Stop pushing,
I have the baby's head.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.671
Don't push yet.

05:40.089 --> 05:44.009
Okay, now, one little push ought to
finish this off. One little push.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.139
You have a beautiful baby girl.

05:51.100 --> 05:57.022
She's so beautiful!

05:58.816 --> 06:01.651
Just gonna take her
and clean her up.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.111
- Not yet.
- Hospital rules.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.822
Please. You'll have her
back before you know it.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.287
Blue team to ICU,
please . Blue team, ICU.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.434
Here she is.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.980
All fresh and clean.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.817
You thought of
a name for her yet?

08:05.902 --> 08:07.235
Christine.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.946
Her name is Christine.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.825
Happy birthday, Christine.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.755
WBAZ time is 8:06.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.759
Three more nights, New York. Three
more nights left in the century.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.385
Three more nights
left in the millennium.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.347
Three more nights
until every computer fails.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.936
Three more nights until the biggest
celebration in the history of this city

08:40.977 --> 08:42.938
starts in Times Square.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.607
Where will you be?

08:47.068 --> 08:49.945
Hey, Bobby, come over here.
Something weird is going on.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.956
- What do you got there, Charlie?
- I don't know.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.208
Pressure's climbing off
the gauge.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.439
Go the other way!

10:43.809 --> 10:45.101
Excuse me.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.217
What the hell are you...

12:46.849 --> 12:49.142
- You're on Gotham Talk.
- Say something interesting.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.936
I'm trying to figure out what
everyone's predicting here.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.398
Is the world going to come to an end at exactly
12:01 on New Year's or is it gonna...

12:55.483 --> 12:56.483
I'll tell you what, lady.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.360
I think you should play it safe,
not quit your job just yet.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.488
Tell you something else,
in two more nights,

13:01.530 --> 13:03.990
this place is gonna see
the wildest party ever.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.117
We're going to be there with
the first hundred callers,

13:06.202 --> 13:07.452
we're gonna make
the most noise,

13:07.536 --> 13:10.246
and we're gonna be the craziest,
and if the world comes to an end,

13:10.331 --> 13:12.457
well, what the hell,
we're all gonna be together!

13:12.541 --> 13:14.626
And if it doesn't
and I don't think it will,

13:14.710 --> 13:17.754
then we'll all have the best
time anybody has ever had.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.200
Let's go. We're gonna be late.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.454
Honey, I'm home.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.336
I was just
pulling myself together.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.256
It's gonna take
a lot more pulling.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.094
You are looking
very sharp this morning.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.346
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.974
You got about five minutes
to get ready. Here.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.560
There's enough caffeine in
this to kill an elephant.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.395
Ought to get you started.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.275
So what's today?

14:20.359 --> 14:21.526
Transport.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.238
Anyone special?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.288
No, just some
Wall Street scumbag.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.332
Why the hell does he need
all this protection?

14:36.417 --> 14:40.962
Well, I guess he fucked with some people
that didn't like being fucked with.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.716
Personally, I like scumbags.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.135
They pay better.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.868
They say breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.624
No, I'm good . Thanks.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.001
Striker 1,
FDR Drive and Bridge.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.004
Follow 3, FDR southbound.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.881
Striker 1, stay close.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.009
Striker 4... Okay, you zeros,

15:28.052 --> 15:30.345
these people are
paying us good money.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.765
Get your heads out of your asses
and start earning those paychecks.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.725
Follow 3,
give me a visual sweep.

15:36.268 --> 15:40.271
Striker 1, rooftops 125 to 136 clear.
Keep them clear.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.108
Striker 4, advise and
contact me at the hotel.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.319
Follow 3 is on approach.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.112
ETA, two minutes.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.866
Striker 1, follow 2 and 3 in
tight formation. Do you copy?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.958
Air 1, make a final sweep.
Roger that.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.877
Follow 3.
We have nest in sight.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.713
Air 1, westbound over Zone 2.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.062
Ten seconds out.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.398
Roger. Ten seconds.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.067
Follow 3, we have arrived.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.820
Keep everyone close.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.577
- We're exposed.
- Roger.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.549
Sky 2, fire escape,
southwest corner.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.844
Fire escape's negative.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.154
You're wrong!
Shooter! Evac! Evac!

17:11.446 --> 17:12.739
Get in the car!

17:15.909 --> 17:16.909
Man down!

17:38.307 --> 17:40.475
Call NYPD! Get me an ambulance!

17:40.517 --> 17:41.934
Striker 1,
what the hell's going on?

17:42.770 --> 17:44.228
I see him, I see him.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.314
Shit!

17:49.818 --> 17:52.528
Oh, shit! Tell me you remembered!
Come on!

17:58.160 --> 17:59.786
Get up, you pussy.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.832
Where's the shooter?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.459
- Headed for the roof.
- So are we.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.549
Sky 2, get the fuck
down here, and now!

18:14.676 --> 18:15.843
Come on, hurry!

18:36.573 --> 18:38.032
Take us up there!

18:54.049 --> 18:56.008
Move in! Move in!

19:28.917 --> 19:30.543
Set us down! Hurry!

19:30.586 --> 19:32.545
There's too much crap
on that roof!

19:32.588 --> 19:34.088
We'll tear off the main rotor.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.090
Then get us down
as low as you can!

19:36.258 --> 19:37.717
Hurry now! Go!

19:39.219 --> 19:40.553
Strap me in!

19:44.266 --> 19:45.641
You're good!

20:20.761 --> 20:22.803
He's going to jump
off the roof! Shit!

20:30.562 --> 20:31.854
He's got him!

20:46.954 --> 20:48.162
Gun! Gun!

21:15.691 --> 21:16.691
Stop him!

22:16.668 --> 22:18.419
The thousand years has ended!

22:18.587 --> 22:20.796
The dark angel
is loosed from his prison!

22:20.881 --> 22:24.592
Get down on the ground and put
your hands behind your head.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.928
You don't know
what you've done!

22:28.013 --> 22:29.722
Get down or I'll put you down!

22:29.765 --> 22:31.390
The thousand years has ended!

22:31.433 --> 22:33.601
You don't know
what you've done!

23:16.353 --> 23:18.521
Priest that drinks.
Can't be all bad.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.981
I think the police may
want that at some point.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.400
They call it evidence.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.943
I like to get a head start.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.486
No reason to
make it easy for them.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.654
Yeah.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.697
All right. Here.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.160
Watch the lines.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.037
Coming through here.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.043
She doesn't look happy
with the statements.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.921
Should've just killed that son of a bitch.
Less paperwork.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.675
- Hey, Detective.
- Bobby. Hey, Jer, it's been a while.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.844
Hey. How are you, Marge?

23:49.886 --> 23:51.387
Can't complain . You?

23:51.847 --> 23:54.223
It's a nice day
to jump out of a helicopter.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.933
Well, just doing my job.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.602
Now, listen.
Something I got to ask you.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.730
Yeah, what is it?
You still drinking?

24:02.190 --> 24:04.024
Oh, yeah, we got all
liquored up this morning.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.819
- We start every day that way.
- I'm just reading his statement.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.779
You said here
the guy spoke to you.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.197
Yeah . So what?

24:10.657 --> 24:12.867
The guy doesn't have a tongue.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.243
What?

24:15.537 --> 24:17.163
He has no tongue?

24:17.205 --> 24:20.207
Why don't I just leave that
little detail out for now?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.500
No big deal, right?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.377
Are you saying
that I imagined all this?

24:23.462 --> 24:24.545
No, I'm just saying.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.088
I saved a life today.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.007
What the hell did you do?
All right, let it go.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.259
No, no. I know what I heard.
All right.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.761
Those people who don't belong
here, get them out of here.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.847
Make sure this place is secure.

24:52.491 --> 24:56.410
A drunk hangs out in the neighborhood
bar, passes out enough times,

24:56.536 --> 24:59.121
people would know where he
lived from carrying him home.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.831
I mean, it's one thing I know.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.375
Yeah, well, it's important
to be an expert at something.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.754
Oh, it took years of research.
This must be it.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.934
What do you want to bet
it's rent-controlled?

25:49.256 --> 25:51.423
Well, I don't think
this is paint.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.970
A real art buff.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.305
I don't go for this look.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.558
It's just too damn busy.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.320
Listen to this.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.323
"I have seen the earth
laid to waste."

26:16.950 --> 26:19.326
"I have seen
the horror to come."

26:19.369 --> 26:21.912
"Is it a sin to wish
you were never born?"

26:22.581 --> 26:25.040
"The thousand years have ended."

26:26.334 --> 26:28.252
"20:7 ."

26:29.212 --> 26:31.964
It ends in a football score.
That's nice.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.679
Hey, I found something.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.931
Can you see what it is?

26:47.397 --> 26:48.731
His tongue.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.320
He must have
cut it out himself.

26:54.446 --> 26:58.699
Okay. And why is it someone
would cut out their own tongue?

26:59.534 --> 27:02.328
- To keep from talking.
- Right.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.584
Well, I could eat.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.590
- Shit!
- What?

27:16.217 --> 27:18.010
All right, I knew that
was gonna happen.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.387
No, it's all right.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.098
There's something in here.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.565
Have you ever seen her before?

28:04.474 --> 28:06.392
This guy is
no ordinary hit man.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.435
No, this one's extraordinary.

28:08.770 --> 28:09.812
Let's get the hell out of here.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.438
This place is making me itch.

28:11.523 --> 28:16.110
- Drop it, don't move! Freeze!
- Don't move! Freeze! Don't move!

28:17.987 --> 28:19.196
It's us.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.701
Jesus. How the hell did
you two find this place?

28:23.993 --> 28:27.121
Lucky guess.
So what did you find out?

28:27.163 --> 28:29.623
His name's Thomas Aquinas.
He's a priest.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.834
Why don't you tell us
something we don't know?

28:31.918 --> 28:33.794
A homicidal priest.
That's good.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.421
Yeah, well, it gets better.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.966
He studied at the Vatican. He was
one of their alleged visionaries.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.802
Came here in '81
to St. John's Church downtown.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.637
Six months ago, he disappeared.

28:43.888 --> 28:47.182
Priests there say he was
having a spiritual crisis.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.561
Oh, yeah. That's what this is about.
Spiritual crisis.

28:51.479 --> 28:52.896
Doesn't make any sense.

28:53.314 --> 28:56.233
I mean, what's a priest doing
shooting at a Wall Street banker?

28:56.443 --> 28:59.611
A Wall Street banker, by the
way, who suddenly disappeared.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.156
Maybe we should ask the girl.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.699
What girl?

29:04.325 --> 29:07.745
The guy. The guy. Priest guy.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.500
There's five million women
living in New York City.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.002
How we gonna find her
without a name?

30:01.257 --> 30:02.382
Here.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.681
Look, I already gave you
some money.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.183
Can you just move on please?

30:11.226 --> 30:14.686
He's coming for you. He's
coming for you, Christine.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.064
How do you know my name?

30:17.148 --> 30:18.565
He's gonna fuck you.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.151
He's gonna fuck you, Christine.
Can you see him?

30:21.486 --> 30:22.319
Can you see him?

30:22.403 --> 30:23.737
Who are you?

30:23.863 --> 30:25.572
How do you know my name?

30:31.079 --> 30:32.871
He's gonna fuck you, Christine.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.221
I'm sorry.

30:50.598 --> 30:51.807
Sorry.

31:53.661 --> 31:55.954
The thousand years have ended.

31:57.123 --> 31:59.166
Thousand years have ended.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.354
"When the thousand years
are ended,"

33:02.730 --> 33:05.816
"Satan shall be loosed out
of his prison."

33:07.485 --> 33:10.070
"20:7 ."

33:22.667 --> 33:24.001
Christine?

33:26.921 --> 33:29.464
Christine?
I'll be there in a sec!

33:46.149 --> 33:47.149
Doctor's office.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.900
Hello, is Dr. Abel in, please?

33:48.943 --> 33:50.777
Who's calling, please?
It's Christine York.

33:51.237 --> 33:54.322
Christine, listen to me.
We've been over this before.

33:54.407 --> 33:59.077
It's a terrible thing to lose your parents.
I know it was a long time ago.

33:59.287 --> 34:02.789
The holidays always make something
like that feel much worse.

34:02.832 --> 34:06.418
Understand, these dreams
are your creation.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.587
There's nothing real
about them.

34:09.922 --> 34:13.467
You control them.
They don't control you.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.637
Take another Xanax
to relieve your anxiety.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.766
You are fine. Trust me.

34:24.562 --> 34:27.313
Another vision?
Why didn't you tell me?

34:27.815 --> 34:29.315
I didn't want you to worry.

34:29.358 --> 34:31.777
I'm your stepmother.
It's my job to worry.

34:32.277 --> 34:33.402
No big deal, really.

34:33.487 --> 34:37.282
Just someone on the subway car
turned into porcelain and shattered.

34:37.784 --> 34:41.578
What's wrong with me? Why do I see things?
Why am I so different?

34:42.330 --> 34:45.248
Oh, you don't know
how special you are.

34:45.666 --> 34:48.960
You're better than everybody else.
Just remember that.

34:49.003 --> 34:52.005
I don't want to be better or worse.
I just want to be normal.

34:52.047 --> 34:53.715
I want a normal life.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.675
You have to have patience.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.678
All good things will come to you.
You'll see.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.438
Excuse me.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.148
I'm sorry, we're closed.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.151
I would like to talk to you
about Thomas Aquinas.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.946
- Father, please, I need you downstairs.
- Just take these.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.948
- Father, please.
- Go.

35:20.868 --> 35:24.746
I've already told the police. Thomas
was a friend of mine and a colleague.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.374
He had nothing to do
with what happened today.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.584
Well, there was no one else
on that fire escape.

35:29.669 --> 35:30.877
You don't understand.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.713
I understand getting shot at,
and I don't like it.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.383
He shot at you?
No, he shot at my client.

35:36.425 --> 35:37.759
And I happened
to get in the way.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.010
Who's your client?

35:39.053 --> 35:40.720
That's irrelevant right now.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.557
What I want to know is why would
a priest try to kill someone?

35:43.641 --> 35:48.395
Listen, you've been drinking. I've got
14 years sober and I can spot that.

35:48.437 --> 35:49.563
Well, good for you.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.232
Your friend and colleague,
was he working for someone?

35:52.275 --> 35:54.276
Yes, he was working for God.

35:54.360 --> 35:57.028
So God ordered a hit
on an investment banker?

35:57.071 --> 35:58.905
There's an awful lot
that you don't know.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.323
You think you've
seen everything?

36:00.408 --> 36:02.701
You haven't. There are
things you never dreamed of.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.286
There's another world
out there!

36:04.370 --> 36:06.621
Thomas saw it
and it destroyed him.

36:06.914 --> 36:10.667
Well, I've seen a lot, too, but there's
nothing that would make me cut my tongue out.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.377
Yeah, well, wait a few days.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.254
What happens in a few days?

36:14.714 --> 36:17.132
Did Thomas tell you
about a girl?

36:19.510 --> 36:20.552
No.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.929
I see. Do you believe in God?

36:25.266 --> 36:28.476
Maybe once. But not anymore.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.103
What happened?

36:30.771 --> 36:32.731
We had a difference of opinion.

36:33.357 --> 36:36.067
I thought that my wife
and daughter should live,

36:36.527 --> 36:38.111
and he felt otherwise.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.071
I'm sorry to hear
about the loss.

36:40.114 --> 36:42.490
Maybe it's time for you
to renew your faith.

36:43.659 --> 36:44.951
This girl.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.663
Is she in trouble?
Does she need help?

36:48.748 --> 36:51.124
I have a lot of things to do here.
Excuse me.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.460
Excuse me, I have a few more
questions, if you don't mind.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.795
I've got a question for you.
If you don't believe in God,

36:55.838 --> 36:57.797
how can you understand
his adversary?

36:57.840 --> 37:01.092
Now I have to believe in God
in order to solve a crime?

37:02.094 --> 37:04.638
I'm sure that you can
find your way out.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.636
How many have received
the stigmata?

37:44.679 --> 37:46.346
She's the third this week.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.060
What is she saying?

37:52.144 --> 37:54.980
Please, for your own good, get
out and forget what you've seen.

37:55.022 --> 37:57.190
Was Thomas part of all this?
There are forces here at work

37:57.233 --> 38:00.944
you couldn't possibly comprehend!
Now, please, leave!

39:06.385 --> 39:10.221
No, it's just I hate the fact that
they put finals after the holiday.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.098
It ruins the whole meaning
of vacation.

39:12.141 --> 39:14.768
I wouldn't worry.
You always do fine.

39:14.810 --> 39:16.895
Besides, a bad grade
isn't the end of the world.

39:32.244 --> 39:33.495
It's you.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.122
- I didn't...
- Where is she?

39:36.374 --> 39:39.751
The girl is safe.
And what of the world?

39:40.294 --> 39:42.545
Everything is as planned.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.131
Our acts go unnoticed,
unquestioned.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.634
We're everywhere.
Daddy, who is it?

39:57.061 --> 39:59.729
- Is this your daughter?
- Yes.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.819
- This is your wife?
- Yes.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.894
- What's wrong, baby? What's wrong?
- It was a dream.

41:21.187 --> 41:24.230
He came for me again.
It's only a dream, angel.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.065
It felt closer.

41:32.072 --> 41:33.948
Throughout the country,
the National Guard

41:34.033 --> 41:36.284
has been put on alert
as a precaution in case...

41:36.368 --> 41:38.745
Rudolph Giuliani urged
all citizens and police

41:38.829 --> 41:40.413
to stay calm during
this holiday season.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.539
No explanations yet

41:41.582 --> 41:43.208
for how blood on the hands
of the Christ child,

41:43.250 --> 41:46.669
depicted in Michelangelo's famous
sculpture of the pieta...

41:46.754 --> 41:48.922
atmosphere of fear and
panic, random acts of violence

41:48.964 --> 41:51.841
are being attributed to satanic
cults who seem determined

41:51.926 --> 41:54.260
to disrupt New Year's celebrations
throughout the world.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.386
Here in New York...

42:12.279 --> 42:14.113
Sorry, pal,
you can't come in here.

42:16.575 --> 42:20.286
The young boys that you seduced
have left their scent upon you.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.124
Remember who it is
that you serve.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.105
Open your eyes, Thomas.

42:57.658 --> 43:00.577
Look. Look at the face
that has haunted your dreams

43:00.661 --> 43:02.120
for a thousand years.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.223
They say you can see
the future, Thomas.

43:24.393 --> 43:27.895
Then you must know exactly
what I'm going to do to you.

43:30.482 --> 43:32.567
We still don't know what we
hope to get from this guy.

43:32.651 --> 43:34.319
He's got no fucking tongue
for Christ's sake.

43:34.361 --> 43:35.445
He can write.

43:35.529 --> 43:39.157
Dr. Hansel, to surgery,
please. Dr. Hansel.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.225
Fuck me.

44:08.687 --> 44:10.730
There is still no explanation

44:10.773 --> 44:14.525
for the devastating explosions that
rocked Midtown two nights ago.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.694
In the wake of
Tuesday night's explosion,

44:16.737 --> 44:19.322
investigators from the
New York City Fire Department

44:19.406 --> 44:21.366
are still at a loss to explain

44:21.408 --> 44:25.161
why the restaurant suddenly burst
into flames, killing at least...

44:25.245 --> 44:27.121
Hey, asshole,
watch where you're going.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.956
Hey, I like the shirt.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.584
Screw you, man.

44:36.590 --> 44:37.799
Hey, kid.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.098
Nice shirt.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.110
I'm telling you, no one entered the room.
Maybe he did it himself.

45:39.153 --> 45:41.154
Then how did he get
the last scalpel in?

45:41.905 --> 45:43.197
Oh, my God.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.824
It just keeps getting better.

45:44.908 --> 45:47.368
I've never seen
anything like this.

45:51.165 --> 45:54.250
I think this is written
in Latin.

45:55.002 --> 45:58.504
"When the thousand
years has ended,"

45:58.589 --> 46:03.551
"Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison ."

46:05.637 --> 46:08.765
This next part is not clear.
I think it's in English.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.892
It says, "Christ..."

46:11.018 --> 46:14.061
"Christ in New York."

46:19.818 --> 46:21.068
Christ!

46:26.784 --> 46:30.203
Well, it's official. I'm
never sleeping again, ever.

46:30.996 --> 46:32.246
You okay?

46:33.207 --> 46:35.458
A guy cuts words
into his chest.

46:35.542 --> 46:37.335
Someone else nails him
to the ceiling.

46:37.961 --> 46:39.545
What's not okay?

46:41.131 --> 46:42.673
So where we going?

46:42.883 --> 46:46.010
The girl. I got to talk to
her, find out what she knows.

46:46.053 --> 46:48.387
Wait, wait, we don't have a name, all right?
That would help.

46:48.472 --> 46:52.558
Well, maybe we do. Maybe it's
not "Christ in New York."

46:52.893 --> 46:56.312
Maybe it's "Chris in New York,"
"Christine in New York."

46:56.688 --> 46:58.397
"Christine York."

46:58.482 --> 47:01.943
Let's run a DMV check and find out
if any of those names come up.

47:08.075 --> 47:11.452
Hello, Christine York. Sometimes
you border on competent.

47:12.412 --> 47:14.080
I know. It's scary, isn't it?

47:22.923 --> 47:24.298
Christine?

47:24.842 --> 47:28.010
Mabel called. She'd like you to get
dressed and join her for lunch.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.512
Grazie, Carson.

48:04.548 --> 48:05.798
No!

48:22.941 --> 48:23.983
Shit!

49:03.774 --> 49:06.317
No! No!

49:08.236 --> 49:09.320
Help!

49:09.363 --> 49:10.696
Goddamn it, get off of me!

49:10.781 --> 49:12.782
Go downstairs and watch
the front door! Please!

49:12.866 --> 49:15.618
Help! There is no
sanctuary but heaven.

49:16.828 --> 49:18.371
You must go there now.
What are you doing?

49:18.455 --> 49:20.623
I commend you to Almighty
God and entrust you...

49:21.208 --> 49:25.586
At what point is this considered
interfering with a police investigation?

49:25.796 --> 49:29.840
Hey, we are private citizens having a
conversation with another citizen.

49:29.925 --> 49:32.760
I mean, I don't think they've
found a way to outlaw that.

49:32.844 --> 49:34.303
At least not yet.

49:36.056 --> 49:38.224
Please! No!

49:40.769 --> 49:41.894
May you return to him...

49:52.197 --> 49:53.698
Go down there.
Do whatever you can.

49:53.740 --> 49:55.616
I need more time
to finish the last rites.

49:55.701 --> 49:58.160
- May Christ, the true shepherd...
- Help!

49:58.662 --> 50:00.079
- Stairs.
- Covered.

50:04.584 --> 50:05.876
Help!

50:11.341 --> 50:12.883
May you see your redeemer...

50:19.099 --> 50:20.516
Forever. Amen.

51:01.892 --> 51:03.184
Son of a bitch!

51:26.958 --> 51:28.375
You all right?

51:29.211 --> 51:32.004
Yeah. Check the body
down the stairs.

51:32.839 --> 51:34.298
What body?

51:36.927 --> 51:39.386
Call the police
and get an ambulance.

51:42.557 --> 51:47.269
Take it easy. We're the good guys.
All right? What happened?

51:49.231 --> 51:51.107
Carson . Those men...

51:52.234 --> 51:54.610
Those men,
they tried to kill me.

51:55.529 --> 51:56.695
Why?

51:58.573 --> 52:01.700
Eight jets, variable speed. That's
what I call dying in style.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.744
What kind of girl lives
in a house like this anyway?

52:03.829 --> 52:06.163
Oh, she's an orphan.
Both parents deceased.

52:06.206 --> 52:09.291
After her mother died, the
home nurse married the father.

52:09.376 --> 52:11.418
Now the nurse
is the sole guardian.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.879
I think it's adorable the way
you talk like a real cop.

52:13.922 --> 52:16.757
Yeah? So you think maybe after they
clean up this mess, we could...

52:16.842 --> 52:18.801
Don't tempt me.
...soak a little?

52:48.415 --> 52:49.790
They relax me. You want one?

52:49.875 --> 52:52.084
Oh, no, thanks. I drink.

52:53.336 --> 52:55.379
My little girl
had one just like it.

52:55.422 --> 52:56.630
Really?

52:56.715 --> 52:59.884
Yeah? You snoop through her
stuff without asking, too?

53:01.052 --> 53:03.095
When I was looking
for something.

53:03.138 --> 53:05.014
What are you looking for?

53:05.765 --> 53:07.641
A connection.

53:07.726 --> 53:10.102
Most days, I don't feel
connected to anyone.

53:10.979 --> 53:13.898
I noticed a lot of
religious books outside.

53:15.483 --> 53:16.692
They're my stepmother's.

53:16.776 --> 53:18.152
Is she a big believer?

53:18.236 --> 53:19.361
No, not really.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.947
It's mostly just kind of
like a hobby with her.

53:22.032 --> 53:25.284
Do you know a priest by the
name of Thomas Aquinas?

53:25.368 --> 53:28.454
No. Is that your connection?
Religion?

53:28.496 --> 53:30.289
I've seen a lot of
attempted murders,

53:30.332 --> 53:32.791
but I've never seen anyone
perform the last rites before.

53:32.834 --> 53:34.543
- Christine?
- In here!

53:36.463 --> 53:39.715
Are you all right? Oh, my God,
I just heard what happened.

53:41.134 --> 53:42.259
Did they hurt you?

53:42.302 --> 53:44.345
I'm okay, but Carson...

53:44.429 --> 53:46.013
I know.

53:48.350 --> 53:51.185
I'm just so glad
you came along when you did.

53:51.811 --> 53:53.062
Thanks.

54:18.713 --> 54:22.675
I didn't realize you knew where the
library was, let alone had a card.

54:24.094 --> 54:26.262
Well, there's
a lot about me you don't know.

54:30.725 --> 54:32.059
They're right outside.

54:32.143 --> 54:34.728
- You must bring her here.
- He is waiting for her.

54:34.813 --> 54:37.898
No, that's impossible! They'll
follow me and find the temple!

54:41.319 --> 54:43.237
I couldn't convince her
to come here.

54:48.827 --> 54:49.868
Yuck!

54:49.911 --> 54:52.454
Then I shall have to go to her.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.707
Did I mention
I had a date tonight?

54:54.791 --> 54:57.293
Not just the inflatable kind.
A real live girl.

54:57.377 --> 54:59.628
Did you break up
with the inflatable one?

54:59.713 --> 55:01.005
Yeah.

55:02.215 --> 55:05.009
She was just too needy.
Everything was about her.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.387
It's just that with this, it's
starting to feel a lot like work.

55:08.680 --> 55:12.433
Normally, I wouldn't mind work,
because, well, you know,

55:12.767 --> 55:14.560
we'd be getting paid.

55:14.644 --> 55:17.688
Watching rich people for free.
It just seems odd, doesn't it?

55:21.318 --> 55:22.985
Okay, I'll wait here.

55:31.911 --> 55:33.412
Change your mind
about the pill?

55:33.496 --> 55:34.538
I found something.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.586
Christine, what are you doing?
Why is that man here?

55:40.754 --> 55:42.546
I'll be five minutes.

55:43.089 --> 55:45.924
She loves me to death, but
she's a little overprotective.

56:10.533 --> 56:12.785
I took this from
one of your attackers.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.412
- Did you show that to the police?
- No.

56:15.538 --> 56:18.290
If I did, it would just end up
in a small plastic envelope

56:18.333 --> 56:19.792
on one of their large shelves.

56:19.834 --> 56:21.001
That's pretty cynical.

56:21.086 --> 56:25.714
Well, I've put a few of those envelopes
up on that large shelf myself.

56:26.007 --> 56:27.549
I used to be a cop.

56:28.760 --> 56:31.220
Now, this amulet
is from a Masonic order

56:31.304 --> 56:34.932
in a former sub-herald
of the Vatican Knights.

56:34.974 --> 56:36.600
The Knights of the Holy See.

56:36.643 --> 56:39.812
They await the return
of the Dark Angel to earth.

56:40.271 --> 56:43.816
So, the men that attacked me
are devil worshipers?

56:43.858 --> 56:47.361
No. This says they're
the good guys.

56:47.445 --> 56:50.155
They're the ones that are supposed
to stop the devil worshipers.

56:50.198 --> 56:53.367
- Those were the good guys?
- What does that have to do with me?

57:04.170 --> 57:07.005
I'm sorry.
I have a medical condition.

57:07.048 --> 57:09.049
Sometimes I see things
that aren't there.

57:09.134 --> 57:12.678
No. I saw it, too.

57:40.123 --> 57:42.124
I've been having visions
ever since I can remember,

57:42.208 --> 57:44.126
but I've never
shared one before.

57:44.752 --> 57:46.712
There must be an explanation.

57:46.754 --> 57:49.173
I hope so because I've been
waiting all my life to hear it.

58:49.817 --> 58:51.401
Let's get out of here! Come on!

58:52.779 --> 58:54.238
You're not going anywhere.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.490
- What are you doing?
- There's no time to discuss this.

58:59.035 --> 59:01.411
After all these years of
waiting, it's finally happening.

59:01.454 --> 59:02.579
What's happening?

59:02.622 --> 59:04.081
You can't run away now!

59:06.459 --> 59:08.377
Stop it! Let her go!

59:08.461 --> 59:09.461
No!

59:13.633 --> 59:15.300
Right now!

59:17.262 --> 59:18.512
Shit!

59:19.389 --> 59:21.098
Don't you love me?

59:21.975 --> 59:24.142
Didn't I give you everything?

59:24.936 --> 59:27.312
Haven't I been a mother to you?

59:47.500 --> 59:49.167
No!

59:49.210 --> 59:50.335
Oh, my God!

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.602
- Christine.
- Oh, no.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:08.854
You know who I am.
I've come for you.

01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:10.606
Let's go . Come on.

01:00:27.498 --> 01:00:31.627
You only had one simple job
and you couldn't even do that.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.395
Hey, Marge? Marge, over here!
We need your help!

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.230
Easy with the hardware.

01:00:55.526 --> 01:00:57.361
Jesus, Marge! What the fuck?

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.740
It's okay, Jer.
We just want the girl.

01:01:02.283 --> 01:01:04.034
Okay, tell me what the
hell is going on here?

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.745
I don't know.
I don't believe you.

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:10.415
All right. I'm coming out.
Throw out the gun.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:13.168
Please don't leave me here.
Please!

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.927
Hands on your head.

01:01:22.136 --> 01:01:25.430
- What?
- Hands on your head . Now!

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:35.482
What do you want with her, Marge?

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.734
Why is she so important?

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.778
Just the girl.
You can kill him.

01:01:54.752 --> 01:01:56.420
Come on! Quickly.

01:02:15.022 --> 01:02:16.815
You, I don't need.

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.316
But you...

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:23.071
Call your people . Find them.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.423
Over here.

01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:47.637
Goddamn it!

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:52.184
Get up . Come on . Get up!

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.019
My best friend is dead.

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:56.938
Everyone is trying to kill us.
I just shot two cops.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.190
Why is everyone after you?

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.358
I don't know.
I swear. I don't know.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:01.943
Why is this happening?

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:05.197
I know it's my fault.
I just don't know why.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:10.160
That man on the stairs,
what do you know about him?

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.954
Nothing.
Come on . I saw your face.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.874
You recognized him.
I don't talk about it.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.460
Tell me. I need to know.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.257
I've seen him before.

01:03:26.093 --> 01:03:27.385
In my dreams.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:31.264
In your dreams?
They're nightmares, really.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:36.144
He takes me
and he makes love to me.

01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:38.438
I've been making love to him
my whole life.

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:42.275
I thought I was crazy, but he
was never real before tonight.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.903
Oh, he's real.
I've seen him before.

01:03:45.738 --> 01:03:46.905
I'm afraid.

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:50.033
Don't be afraid. I won't let
him do any harm to you.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:54.496
I'm afraid of me. I'm afraid that if
I see him, if he tries to take me,

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.540
I'm gonna want him to.

01:03:59.752 --> 01:04:00.961
Let's go!

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.505
Where are we going?
To get some answers.

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:17.352
You don't need that.
You have no enemies here.

01:04:17.436 --> 01:04:21.106
I'm not so sure about that. This girl
was just attacked by your people.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:24.901
Your Vatican Knights almost killed her!
Vatican Knights?

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.736
Oh, my God.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.699
Well, they're not my people. They think
they're doing God's work, but they're not.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.535
I want to know what's going on
and I want to know right now.

01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:36.371
All right, put the gun away.
Did anybody see you come?

01:04:38.165 --> 01:04:41.376
- No.
- Good .We should be safe here.

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:46.089
According to the scriptures, he can't
see inside of the house of God.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:49.801
- Who can't?
- Maybe now you're ready to believe.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:09.529
Her hands are healed.

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.323
That's the power of faith.

01:05:11.365 --> 01:05:13.700
Who is she?
She's a Polish peasant.

01:05:13.784 --> 01:05:15.744
She fell into a trance
about two weeks ago,

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:18.997
and then she began to speak in a language
she couldn't possibly have known.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.708
And she made a prophecy
about End of Days.

01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:22.834
End of Days?

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:26.338
Of man's destruction and the
Unholy's reign upon the earth.

01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:30.216
Why don't you stop all this church talk
and tell us what the hell is going on?

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:31.301
Who's after her?

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:34.095
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'll try to explain.

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:37.891
Do you know anything
about the Number of the Beast?

01:05:37.975 --> 01:05:40.769
Revelation of St. John?
From his dream?

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.062
666?

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:44.856
The Number of the Beast
is not 666.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:49.110
Often in dreams, numbers appear
upside down and backwards.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:53.031
So, 666 becomes 999.

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:56.534
Like in 1999,
the year of his return.

01:05:56.577 --> 01:05:58.453
What does that
have to do with me?

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:04.042
The return of Satan.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.753
Does any of this
look familiar to you?

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:21.393
She's been chosen.
He's in her blood.

01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:26.231
The Holy Church has been searching
for you since the day you were born.

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:29.317
- Chosen for what?
- Every thousand years, on the eve of the millennium,

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:31.319
the Dark Angel comes
and takes a body

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:35.573
and then he walks the earth, looking
for a woman who will bear his child.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:40.412
It all has to happen in that unholy
hour before midnight on New Year's Eve.

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:43.915
If he consummates your flesh
with his human body,

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:46.751
then he unlocks
the gate of hell

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:50.755
and everything as we know it
ceases to exist.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.883
So, the Prince of Darkness
wants to conquer the earth,

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:57.095
but he has to wait until an hour
before midnight of New Year's Eve?

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:58.221
Is this Eastern time?

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.181
It's got nothing to do
with New Year's Eve.

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.892
It has to do with a temporary
celestial alignment.

01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:05.437
The Gregorian monks
studied the heavens.

01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:09.315
They were able to calculate the
precise moment of this event.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.068
They created our calendar
by mapping this event

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.654
and counting backwards
from that moment.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.614
I think it was a mistake
to come here.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.324
It doesn't matter whether
you believe or not.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:21.619
He's real and he won't rest
till he finds this girl.

01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:22.996
Why did he pick me?

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.790
Because the stars were right
when you were born.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.960
A man's body was also chosen,
just like yours.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.964
If the devil does exist, why
doesn't your God do anything?

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.299
It's not my God.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:38.011
It's our God, and he doesn't
say that he will save us.

01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:41.264
He says that we will
save ourselves.

01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:44.684
Save myself? What am I supposed to do?
Get a restraining order?

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:47.812
- We have to have faith.
- Faith.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:49.898
Yes, faith.
It's an interesting concept.

01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:53.276
If you read the Bible,
you can't miss it. Faith!

01:07:53.986 --> 01:07:56.821
Between your faith
and my Glock 9 mm,

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.491
I take my Glock.
Come, let's go.

01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:03.119
I'm afraid it takes a person of
pure heart to defeat pure evil.

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:05.497
You did your job. You brought
her here to people of faith.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.332
We'll protect her.
We'll hide her.

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:10.126
You know, you live
in a different world.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:14.839
We have some real serious problems
here and this is not solving them.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:18.134
Satan's greatest trick was
convincing man he didn't exist.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.308
I don't...
This all feels true to me.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:28.560
You'll be safer with me.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:31.397
At least, I can fight this guy
with something real.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:34.692
You know what to do.
You feel it.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.412
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:50.875
Let him go.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:22.573
It gets easier when
you accept what you are.

01:09:22.616 --> 01:09:24.242
A fallen soul.

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:32.250
Door's locked,
no windows broken.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:35.795
How did I get in here?
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.298
Oh, I think you know who I am.

01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:40.425
You just don't want to
believe it.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.846
I took a bullet for you.
I protected you.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:48.765
Oh, no, no, you didn't protect me.
You protected this body.

01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:50.935
Am I getting a pattern here?

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:55.940
So much pain. "Not to be
taken with alcohol ."

01:09:57.109 --> 01:09:58.526
Remember that.

01:10:01.947 --> 01:10:04.324
To lose a wife and child.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.454
I can't even imagine
what that must be like.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:13.291
What do you want?
To make you happy again.

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:35.855
A gift from your daughter?

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.367
Amy?

01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:50.161
Don't stay in there too long.
You'll turn into a prune.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.246
Emily.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:52.997
Come on, darling.
It's time to get out.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.834
Got to get you dressed. Your
daddy's gonna be home soon.

01:10:56.877 --> 01:10:58.920
I have the best daddy
in the whole world.

01:10:59.004 --> 01:11:01.047
Yes, you certainly do.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.841
But I don't think
he'll be home.

01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:06.219
Now, what makes you say
a silly thing like that?

01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:07.679
He never comes home.

01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:09.639
Well, honey, you know
your daddy works hard.

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:12.850
It's not about how much time you're there.
It's about "quality time."

01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:16.312
Now, he'll be home just like he promised.
You'll see.

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:18.314
He keeps his promises.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:22.527
I can give it all back to you.
Everything that he took away.

01:11:22.903 --> 01:11:24.070
Everything.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:27.365
You can hold your wife again.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:31.035
You can watch your daughter walk
through the door in her prom dress.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:34.247
All you have to do
is tell me where the girl is.

01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:37.458
Come on. She's a nobody to you.
You don't even know her.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:40.628
You're in the middle of something
you don't really understand.

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:44.048
You think you're saving her from me?
She wants to be with me.

01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:45.383
You know that.

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.135
So, what did you do
in school today?

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:50.680
You think I'd harm her?
I'd treat her like a queen.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:54.350
You told me once you'd do
anything to get your family back.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:58.062
You want them?
This is your chance.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:00.857
They're not real.
Does that matter?

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.567
Oh, yes.

01:12:02.943 --> 01:12:06.362
I think you need to be reminded
of how painful reality is.

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:09.699
No!

01:12:30.554 --> 01:12:32.263
Don't hurt my baby!

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.473
Daddy!

01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:35.266
Let my daughter go!

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.103
Daddy!

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:41.481
Let go of my baby!

01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:48.446
No!

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.701
Oh, it's true.

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:55.328
Oh, no.

01:13:12.012 --> 01:13:13.971
It wasn't your fault.

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:16.516
I wasn't there.
No, you were just...

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.267
You were out doing your job.

01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:20.436
I wasn't fucking there!

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:23.481
Oh, look at you.
Torn apart by guilt.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:24.857
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:27.485
You were an honest cop.
You didn't take money.

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:31.114
You had to testify against them even
after they threatened your family.

01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:33.199
Most people would never
testify against those guys.

01:13:33.283 --> 01:13:35.701
They're not like you.
You had to do the right thing.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:39.163
And where was God? He could've
stopped it, but he didn't.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.207
He fucked you. And then
he made you feel guilty.

01:13:41.291 --> 01:13:44.335
Me, I don't do guilt. I
didn't do what happened here.

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:47.463
He did.
Now you just think about that.

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:49.340
Then you tell me
who's really your friend.

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:52.385
I can make it like
it never happened.

01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:54.971
All for the price of
a stranger's address.

01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:57.640
No!

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.978
You will never see the girl!

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.981
Now, you see.
Now you're upsetting me.

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:08.109
You don't want to
see me upset, believe me.

01:14:08.193 --> 01:14:11.904
Oh, you want to fuck with me?
You think you know bad?

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:15.950
You're a fucking choirboy
compared to me! A choirboy!

01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:18.703
You're in touch with your anger.
I really like that.

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:21.956
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna have a drink.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.917
You and I are so much alike.

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.503
We're nothing alike! Nothing!

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:31.174
Look at yourself. Look at this.
Look at what you are now.

01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:34.552
You walked away from the light just like me.
You want one?

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:36.471
You need to get out, now.

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:39.015
Come on.
You know what's in your heart.

01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:40.308
We're on the same side.

01:14:40.392 --> 01:14:43.060
I'm not on your side,
and I never will be.

01:14:43.103 --> 01:14:46.689
What, you're on his side? He's the
one who took away your family.

01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:49.150
Let me tell you something
about him.

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:52.320
He is the biggest
underachiever of all time.

01:14:52.404 --> 01:14:54.739
He just had
a good publicist, that's all.

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:56.782
Something good happens,
"It's his will ."

01:14:56.867 --> 01:15:00.203
Something bad happens,
"He moves in mysterious ways."

01:15:00.245 --> 01:15:03.456
You take that overblown press
kit they call the Bible.

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.750
You look for the answer in
there, what do they tell you?

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:08.294
"Shit happens ." Please.

01:15:09.129 --> 01:15:12.256
He treated you like garbage.
You walked away.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.926
I'm not the bad guy.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:19.180
What about the End of Days?

01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:22.433
Think of it as a new beginning.
A change of management.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.810
And you'll be right there
with me on the ground floor.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:27.230
It will be so cool.

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:29.941
Tell me what you want.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:33.444
Tell me what you really want
and I'll give it to you.

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.116
I'll tell you what I want.

01:15:41.828 --> 01:15:45.540
I want you to go to hell.

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:49.961
You see,
sometimes the problem is

01:15:51.463 --> 01:15:55.883
hell comes to you!

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.316
Don't fuck up the coat.

01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:17.071
I've wasted too much time
on this.

01:16:17.155 --> 01:16:21.158
You see those insignificant little
dots down there? Do you see them?

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:24.412
That's what you mean to me.
Now, give me the girl!

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:26.914
Not today.

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:53.858
Look down.

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:58.863
Now, look in your heart and
tell me you don't want to die.

01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:01.532
All you got to do
is take my hand.

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:04.952
And I'll give you back
everything that he took away.

01:17:08.832 --> 01:17:11.042
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:15.296
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:17:23.555 --> 01:17:25.806
Fuck you!

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.773
Hey. Hey!

01:18:17.567 --> 01:18:19.902
I thought you were dead. Couple
of seconds, I would've been.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:23.531
All I remember is stepping out of the van,
then I woke up in the fucking gutter.

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:26.158
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What are you talking about?

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:28.452
I've been looking for you all night.
What the hell happened to you?

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:35.292
Hey. Hey. Hey.
I can't trust you.

01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:37.920
All right, look, I don't know how
much you had to drink, okay?

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:40.256
- But let's not point the gun at me?
- I just need to know.

01:18:40.298 --> 01:18:41.716
You need to know what?

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.426
That you are you.
Of course, I'm me!

01:18:43.468 --> 01:18:46.053
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:49.181
You took his body.

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:52.309
All right. You're ill . Okay?
You need some help . All right?

01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:55.896
Oh, fuck! Jesus!

01:18:56.314 --> 01:18:58.607
Fuck. You're bleeding.

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:01.026
Of course, I'm bleeding!
You fucking shot me!

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:04.405
I just needed to find out!
Well, you found out, okay?

01:19:04.489 --> 01:19:06.365
Stop being such a pussy!
Pussy? Come on!

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:08.868
It's just a scratch.
Oh, Christ.

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:10.578
Fuck. Does it hurt?

01:19:10.662 --> 01:19:12.329
Yes! What do you think?

01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:15.624
Jesus. What the hell's the matter with you?
What's going on here?

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:17.460
I can't explain.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.965
I shouldn't have
left her alone like that.

01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:26.051
I should be with her.

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:27.678
Tell me what to do.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.181
I got to get back there.

01:19:30.348 --> 01:19:32.683
Got to get her as far away
from him as I can.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.519
Okay, we leave town. You get her.
I'll get a Striker car.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.021
Just tell me where to meet you.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:47.031
St. John's Church in one hour.

01:19:53.371 --> 01:19:55.331
How much longer, Father?

01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:59.794
Well, he has to sire his child between
11: 00 and midnight tomorrow night.

01:19:59.878 --> 01:20:02.546
So, we must keep you hidden
till that hour passes.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.722
- We've come to help.
- Your Eminence.

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:16.560
In this hour of darkness, we
need all the help we can get.

01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:20.397
How's the girl?

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:22.483
The girl's fine. Thanks.

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:27.404
No.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:32.117
No. Father! Father, they're the
ones who tried to kill me!

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:36.580
- No!
- Your Eminence, what are you doing?

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.582
- We cannot allow this union to take place.
- No! No.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:39.959
- Please!
- You can't! You mustn't!

01:20:40.043 --> 01:20:41.126
Let go!

01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:42.336
She is only one life.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:45.422
How many lives are you prepared
to end if we do nothing?

01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:47.758
That's not who we are.
Of course, it is.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:50.928
We are doing God's work. We are
preventing the End of Days.

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:54.265
But you can't prevent evil
by doing evil.

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:56.141
- There is no time.
- No!

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:58.644
- It's the only way.
- No!

01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:00.521
- No!
- May God forgive us!

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:01.939
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:21:08.905 --> 01:21:12.783
I can do this all day long.
Now, let her go.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:14.660
You must let us finish.

01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:15.953
If she is slain,

01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:19.081
his hope of creating a kingdom
on earth dies with her.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:20.958
Her death is God's will.

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:22.668
It's not God's will,
it's your will.

01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:24.211
- And it will lead to our destruction.
- Jericho.

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:26.839
She must be removed. It's
the only way to defeat him.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.259
For a thousand years, we
prepared ourselves for this.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:31.886
We're not afraid to die.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:35.306
Good, because
I'm not afraid to kill you.

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:36.974
Let her go.

01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:57.828
Go . Go . Get out of here.

01:22:00.665 --> 01:22:01.707
Go!

01:22:08.381 --> 01:22:09.840
God help us.

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.634
We're too late.

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:15.971
I've come for my wife.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.056
Let's go.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:21.185
This is the house of the Lord, our
God, and you are not welcome here.

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:26.315
I can stand the pain of being in church.
How much pain can you bear?

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:29.693
Christine, come to me.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.446
I am the one
you've been waiting for.

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.615
I am the answer
to your prayers.

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:37.910
In the name of God,
I order you to leave here now!

01:22:42.707 --> 01:22:44.750
May the wrath of God destroy...

01:23:09.275 --> 01:23:12.069
A thousand years you have
waited for my return.

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:14.113
And behold, you have failed.

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:18.993
And with your last breath, you shall
bear witness to the End of Days.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.226
No! Jericho!

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:54.236
Get in the car! Run!

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:58.866
Jesus! Come on!

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:13.255
Bobby, what the hell
are you doing?

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:14.965
What are you doing?
Open the door!

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.176
Come on, open up!
Open the door!

01:24:19.345 --> 01:24:22.139
Jer! Please, stop the car!

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:24.266
Please!

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:36.169
No!

01:25:58.194 --> 01:26:00.070
You should've taken my offer.

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:03.323
At least, you would have
been happy once in your life.

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:13.250
Let her go, or I'll kill you.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:16.170
Oh, so much anger,
so much hatred.

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:18.088
You're almost there.

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:28.098
I'm gonna hurt you so bad,
you're gonna beg to die.

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:31.643
But I'm not gonna let you.
It's not gonna be that easy.

01:26:31.936 --> 01:26:35.606
You're mine, and I want you
to see what's gonna happen.

01:27:32.872 --> 01:27:35.540
World religious leaders
have asked their followers

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:39.169
to prepare for the new millennium
not with celebrating and partying,

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:42.047
but rather with acts of
kindness, compassion...

01:27:42.131 --> 01:27:46.260
This is it, New York. The very
last day of the first 2,000 years.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:00.167
How long have I been out?

01:29:00.251 --> 01:29:02.294
You almost slept the whole day.

01:29:02.378 --> 01:29:04.087
You're lucky to be alive.

01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:16.099
The time?

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:17.768
It's almost 7: 00.

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:19.061
It's not too late.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:21.480
He has the girl.

01:29:21.731 --> 01:29:23.065
But it's not too late.

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:55.764
Jesus. What did you do?
Get hit by a truck?

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.392
No, the truck missed me.

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:28.880
Where the hell are you going?
Doing my job.

01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:31.508
You know,
the cops are after you.

01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:34.094
They have to wait.
I've got to do something.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:43.854
That son of a bitch.

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:22.869
- Do you wish entrance?
- Yes.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:31.503
You have much hatred
and vengeance in your heart.

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.838
You may pass.

01:35:05.449 --> 01:35:07.784
You know this is what you want.

01:35:26.345 --> 01:35:28.471
You can't resist, can you?

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.974
'Cause you don't want to.

01:35:33.686 --> 01:35:37.564
I didn't come here to hurt you.
I came here to love you.

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:43.528
Relax.

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:45.905
Give yourself to me.

01:36:14.393 --> 01:36:16.060
No one move,
or I kill the girl.

01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:17.896
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:19.689
You're not gonna kill her.

01:36:19.732 --> 01:36:22.192
You said it yourself.
I have a dark heart.

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:24.986
Then stand with me.
I'll tell you what.

01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:28.907
You let us both out of here, and
I'll stand wherever you want.

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:31.659
Step back or
I'll pull the trigger.

01:36:31.702 --> 01:36:35.371
I didn't want to kill you. But
now you leave me no choice.

01:36:42.588 --> 01:36:44.214
Let her go, Jer.

01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:46.841
Oh, don't look at me like that.

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:49.928
You'd be amazed what you agree
to when you're on fire.

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:54.432
Don't do it, Bobby. You're better than this.
You're better than him.

01:36:54.558 --> 01:36:56.559
You know, considering
how you've lived your life,

01:36:56.644 --> 01:37:00.897
when this is all over, what makes you
think you're going upstairs anyways?

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:04.234
Come on, Jer. This is the main event.
It's gonna happen.

01:37:04.276 --> 01:37:06.569
Why shouldn't you have
the best seats in the house?

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:09.489
You will never get a shot off,
and you know it.

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:16.287
Don't do it.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.291
Bobby.

01:37:23.003 --> 01:37:25.004
I thought we had a deal.

01:37:25.256 --> 01:37:26.923
Bobby.

01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:48.528
Well, I guess the deal is off.

01:37:55.327 --> 01:37:56.744
No!

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:01.958
You son of a bitch!

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.007
Up here.

01:39:02.895 --> 01:39:04.145
Shit!

01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:34.926
- Oh, thank God .I thought I hit you.
- Just get us out of here!

01:39:40.015 --> 01:39:41.724
- Let's go.
- Give me a minute.

01:39:43.227 --> 01:39:46.229
I'd feel a lot better if you'd show
me how to use one of those things.

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:48.398
I wanna do something.
Let me help.

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.066
All right. Here.

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.195
You take the gun. Line up
the sight with your target.

01:39:54.238 --> 01:39:56.948
Beware of the recoil.
Here's the magazine.

01:39:57.032 --> 01:39:59.075
Put it in . Load.

01:39:59.118 --> 01:40:01.995
Only pull the trigger
when you're ready...

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:06.749
- Like that?
- Yeah, like that.

01:40:28.939 --> 01:40:30.732
He's on the tracks!

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:33.401
Shit!

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:35.611
- Don't stop.
- What are you doing?

01:40:35.654 --> 01:40:37.071
Don't stop!

01:40:57.092 --> 01:40:58.468
He's gone.

01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:52.355
Oh, God.

01:42:03.367 --> 01:42:05.284
We must separate the cars.
What?

01:42:05.369 --> 01:42:06.619
Separate the cars.

01:42:27.099 --> 01:42:33.062
Jericho!

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.785
Don't let go!

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:57.712
That's it. Come on!

01:43:06.763 --> 01:43:08.014
Jericho!

01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:50.139
Here. Hold on!

01:44:46.154 --> 01:44:48.030
Jericho!

01:44:49.241 --> 01:44:53.369
How can you expect to defeat
me when you are but a man

01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:56.205
and I am forever?

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.913
We must lock the doors!

01:45:47.966 --> 01:45:50.593
- Deliver us, oh, Lord...
- Everyone out!

01:45:51.053 --> 01:45:54.138
Get them to a safe place!
Get them out of here!

01:46:23.627 --> 01:46:25.461
What are we gonna do?

01:46:29.925 --> 01:46:31.092
- Hide.
- No.

01:46:31.134 --> 01:46:32.468
Just hide!

01:47:49.546 --> 01:47:53.048
Please, God, help me.

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:56.385
Give me strength.

01:51:00.487 --> 01:51:04.365
Christine?

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.241
Jericho?

01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:13.999
Are you all right?

01:51:14.584 --> 01:51:16.126
What happened?

01:51:17.003 --> 01:51:18.379
It's over.

01:51:18.588 --> 01:51:22.883
We won.

01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:28.764
Let's go.

01:51:37.941 --> 01:51:39.191
What's wrong?

01:51:40.235 --> 01:51:41.902
Nothing is wrong.

01:51:45.031 --> 01:51:47.074
Everything is the way
it should be.

01:51:47.117 --> 01:51:50.536
No! Jericho! No! No!

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:53.038
No, please! No!
What are you doing?

01:51:53.415 --> 01:51:55.666
Jericho! No!

01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:04.049
Stop it!

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.222
You died for nothing.
You just bought them time.

01:52:10.306 --> 01:52:13.809
Please. You have to fight him, Jericho.
I know you.

01:52:13.893 --> 01:52:15.227
You're stronger than he is.

01:52:18.648 --> 01:52:21.275
That's why you came back for me.
Don't let him win.

01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:01.315
Run.

01:53:09.908 --> 01:53:10.991
No!

01:53:55.703 --> 01:53:57.246
Daddy?

01:55:08.234 --> 01:55:09.610
Thank you.
