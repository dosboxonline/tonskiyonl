WEBVTT

03:27.125 --> 03:28.585
Ugh.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.506
Hey, Mr. McAllister.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.678
- Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
- You know what they say about the early bird.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.598
Yeah, I do.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.060
Good luck there, Tracy.

04:27.143 --> 04:28.770
- Thanks, Mr. M.
- Mm-hmm.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.855
- I'll see you in class.
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

04:33.066 --> 04:37.153
<i>None of this would've happened
if Mr. McAllister hadn't meddled the way he did.</i>

04:37.236 --> 04:41.908
<i>He should've just accepted things as they are,
instead of trying to interfere with destiny.</i>

04:42.784 --> 04:47.205
<i>You see, you can't interfere with destiny.
That's why it's destiny.</i>

04:47.288 --> 04:52.418
<i>And if you try to interfere, the same thing's
just gonna happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.</i>

04:55.296 --> 04:59.926
<i>It's hard to remember how the whole
thing started, the whole election mess.</i>

05:00.009 --> 05:02.345
<i>What I do remember is that I loved my job.</i>

05:02.428 --> 05:07.850
<i>I was a teacher, an educator,
and I couldn't imagine doing anything else.</i>

05:08.351 --> 05:11.354
Mr. McAllister. Mr. M!

05:11.437 --> 05:13.773
Quit daydreaming. Get back to work.

05:15.066 --> 05:17.527
<i>The students knew
it wasn't just a job for me.</i>

05:17.610 --> 05:19.153
<i>I got involved.</i>

05:19.237 --> 05:21.239
Put down the cards, boys!

05:21.322 --> 05:22.991
This game is over!

05:23.074 --> 05:25.576
<i>- And I cared.</i>
- Come on, Wolverines!

05:25.660 --> 05:26.953
Defence! Let's go!

05:27.036 --> 05:29.330
<i>And I think I made a difference.</i>

05:29.414 --> 05:33.668
<i>I knew I touched the students' lives
during their difficult young adult years,</i>

05:33.751 --> 05:36.045
<i>and I took that responsibility seriously.</i>

05:39.173 --> 05:43.761
<i>In the 12 years I taught US history,
civics, and current events at Carver,</i>

05:43.845 --> 05:46.222
<i>I was voted
Teacher of the Year three times —</i>

05:46.305 --> 05:48.266
<i>a school record.</i>

05:49.308 --> 05:51.769
<i>Teaching was all I'd ever wanted to do.</i>

05:53.479 --> 05:55.082
"We will not continue the current system..."

05:55.106 --> 05:57.442
<i>Standing in front of
a roomful of young people,</i>

05:57.525 --> 06:01.696
<i>trying to get them excited about the world,
trying to make them think,</i>

06:01.779 --> 06:06.909
<i>preparing them for the tough moral
and ethical decisions that they'd face as adults.</i>

06:06.993 --> 06:09.287
<i>That's how I wanted to spend my life.</i>

06:10.288 --> 06:14.125
So is this a moral situation
or an ethical situation?

06:14.208 --> 06:17.003
What's the difference
between morals and ethics anyway?

06:17.712 --> 06:19.047
Anybody.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.050
- Derek.
- Yeah.

06:22.133 --> 06:25.678
Ethics is like when you do
what society tells you is right to do.

06:25.762 --> 06:27.346
And morals...

06:29.682 --> 06:32.685
Yeah, yeah, you're on the right track.
Can anybody help him out?

06:35.354 --> 06:36.355
Michelle.

06:37.231 --> 06:41.110
Morals are like... lessons.
You know, like the moral of a story.

06:41.194 --> 06:45.323
It's what you learn from a story
or a fable or something.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.408
Or a life experience. Good.

06:47.492 --> 06:48.785
And ethics?

06:49.660 --> 06:52.080
Um, ethics is how you use the morals...

06:52.830 --> 06:54.540
that you learn from the story?

06:55.458 --> 06:58.920
Yeah, okay, but I think
we're missing something key here.

06:59.003 --> 07:00.379
What are we missing?

07:07.595 --> 07:08.805
Tracy.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.224
Ethics are rules of conduct —

07:12.100 --> 07:13.559
<i>Tracy Flick.</i>

07:13.643 --> 07:15.186
<i>Tracy Flick.</i>

07:15.269 --> 07:18.272
<i>I'd seen a lot of ambitious students
come and go over the years,</i>

07:18.356 --> 07:21.484
<i>but Tracy Flick, she was a special case.</i>

07:22.777 --> 07:26.280
<i>Some people say I'm an overachiever,
but I think they're just jealous.</i>

07:26.364 --> 07:29.742
<i>My mom always tells me I'm different.
You know, special.</i>

07:29.826 --> 07:32.054
<i>And if you look at all the things
I've accomplished so far,</i>

07:32.078 --> 07:33.871
<i>I think you'd have to agree.</i>

07:41.003 --> 07:43.381
<i>Here I am as Hodel in</i> Fiddler On The Roof.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.091

07:48.177 --> 07:51.722
<i>And here I am on KCHS,
our student-run TV station.</i>

07:51.806 --> 07:54.183
<i>...that the littering must stop.</i>

07:54.267 --> 07:55.726
<i>Tracy Flick reporting.</i>

07:55.810 --> 07:57.019
Which means...

07:57.103 --> 07:59.856
<i>But it was in the SGA,
the Student Government Association,</i>

07:59.939 --> 08:01.524
<i>where I made my biggest mark.</i>

08:01.607 --> 08:03.151
<i>I never missed a single meeting,</i>

08:03.234 --> 08:06.696
<i>and I volunteered for every committee,
as long as I could lead it.</i>

08:06.779 --> 08:09.740
I agree with Ashley! I think we should
rent the barrels ahead of time.

08:09.824 --> 08:11.951
Because what happened last time
was a travesty.

08:12.034 --> 08:15.079
It was ridiculous, and I think
it really reflected poorly on all of us.

08:15.163 --> 08:19.917
<i>Now Tracy Flick was poised to win
the presidency of the student body.</i>

08:20.001 --> 08:23.379
<i>And so far, she was running unopposed.</i>

08:23.462 --> 08:25.923
...determined by a culture
at a certain time in history.

08:26.966 --> 08:30.636
<i>Oh, there's one more thing about Tracy
I think you should know.</i>

08:31.304 --> 08:34.807
Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe it.

08:34.890 --> 08:38.561
Don't tell me that.
Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.563
<i>A few months before the election,</i>

08:40.645 --> 08:45.943

08:54.744 --> 08:56.972

<i>- ♪ Foxy ♪
- But basically, he was a good guy.</i>

09:00.917 --> 09:03.169
<i>Our wives became best friends too.</i>

09:03.252 --> 09:07.965
<i>And when Dave and Linda's son Darryl was born,
they asked us to be his godparents.</i>

09:09.675 --> 09:12.762
- "B" to side "C"...
<i>- You probably think the worst,</i>

09:12.845 --> 09:16.515
<i>that Mr. Novotny was taking horrible advantage
of one of his students.</i>

09:16.599 --> 09:19.101
<i>But it wasn't like that at all.</i>

09:19.185 --> 09:23.022
<i>Our relationship was based
on mutual respect and admiration.</i>

09:23.105 --> 09:25.399
<i>I mean, during my sophomore year
in Geometry,</i>

09:25.483 --> 09:27.735
<i>it was strictly professional between us.</i>

09:27.818 --> 09:29.362
<i>I mean, nothing.</i>

09:29.445 --> 09:32.156
<i>It wasn't until junior year when we
worked together on the yearbook</i>

09:32.240 --> 09:34.909
<i>that things got kind of serious.</i>

09:34.992 --> 09:38.663
<i>One night he took us editors out
to celebrate after a deadline.</i>

09:38.746 --> 09:42.375
<i>Eventually, Dave and I were left alone,
and we got to talking.</i>

09:42.458 --> 09:46.128
<i>Not like teacher and student,
but like two adults.</i>

09:46.212 --> 09:47.421
You know, Tracy,

09:47.505 --> 09:51.342
I notice that you don't seem to
have any close friends at Carver.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.427
You seem to be kind of a loner.

09:54.262 --> 09:56.264
No, I'm not. I'm just real busy.

09:56.347 --> 09:58.933
Oh, no. I know. I know it's not by choice.

09:59.016 --> 10:03.938
I just mean that — that, well...
being the kind of person you are,

10:04.021 --> 10:07.775
it must be really difficult for you
to find somebody you can talk to.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.946
What do you mean?
What kind of person am I?

10:14.323 --> 10:19.912
Tracy, you know, I've been watching you
for going on three years now,

10:19.996 --> 10:22.665
and I think you are
one of the most talented,

10:22.748 --> 10:25.876
hardworking, sensitive, attractive,

10:25.960 --> 10:28.170
brilliant students I...

10:28.254 --> 10:29.463
No.

10:30.423 --> 10:32.758
<i>Human beings</i> I have ever met.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.177
Thank you.

10:35.261 --> 10:39.807
And I know that sometimes people like you
have to pay a price

10:39.890 --> 10:41.392
for their greatness,

10:42.560 --> 10:44.645
and that price is loneliness.

10:46.105 --> 10:48.149
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but...

10:48.858 --> 10:51.652
it just seems to me
like you might need a friend.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.910
<i>Since I grew up without a dad,
you might assume, psychologically,</i>

10:59.994 --> 11:01.996
<i>I was looking for a father figure.</i>

11:02.079 --> 11:04.665
<i>But that had nothing to do with it at all.</i>

11:04.749 --> 11:09.545
<i>It was just that Dave was so strong,
and he made me feel so safe and protected.</i>

11:10.463 --> 11:13.549
<i>It was the first time somebody
ever saw the real me,</i>

11:13.632 --> 11:15.676
<i>the me that nobody else knows.</i>

12:23.285 --> 12:26.122
You did it in your house?
In your own house?

12:26.205 --> 12:29.583
Look, Jim, okay,
I know it seems crazy, but...

12:29.667 --> 12:32.962
Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that

12:33.045 --> 12:34.755
Tracy and I

12:34.839 --> 12:39.009
are totally, totally... in love.

12:40.261 --> 12:42.346
- In love?
- Yeah.

12:42.430 --> 12:43.639
It's serious.

12:43.722 --> 12:47.059
She inspires me
in ways that Linda never has.

12:47.143 --> 12:49.478
She even wants to read my novel.

12:49.562 --> 12:52.481
- But you haven't written your novel.
- That's the whole point!

12:52.565 --> 12:55.234
I... I've got the whole thing right here!

12:55.317 --> 12:57.069
I just need to get it out there.

12:57.153 --> 13:00.406
And Tracy wants me to write it
so she can read it.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.824
It's beautiful.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.659
Dave...

13:03.742 --> 13:06.036
I'm just saying this as your friend.

13:06.912 --> 13:10.124
What you're doing is really, really wrong,

13:10.207 --> 13:12.168
and you've gotta stop.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.794
The line you've crossed is...

13:14.587 --> 13:16.255
It's immoral, and it's illegal.

13:16.338 --> 13:20.009
Jim, come on.
I don't need a lecture on ethics.

13:20.092 --> 13:22.928
I'm not talking about ethics.
I'm talking about morals.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.640
What's the difference?

13:26.724 --> 13:30.227
<i>I guess I don't have to tell you
how this all turned out.</i>

13:47.328 --> 13:51.165
Tracy's mom, sh-she doesn't understand.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.709
No, I'd say she doesn't.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.463
The fact is,
I have never seen a mother so upset.

13:58.297 --> 14:00.341
All right.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.719
I know what Tracy told her mother,
what her mother told me.

14:03.802 --> 14:07.932
I need to hear this from you
because I have a legal responsibility here.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.642
Let me ask you this.

14:12.603 --> 14:14.855
Did you cross the line with this girl?

14:22.947 --> 14:24.156
I di...

14:24.949 --> 14:26.158
W-We...

14:28.285 --> 14:30.120
We're in love.

14:34.542 --> 14:35.709
<i>Your novel?</i>

14:35.793 --> 14:38.337
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Linda.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.838
<i>After Dave got fired,</i>

14:39.922 --> 14:42.841
<i>Linda kicked him out of the house
and filed for divorce.</i>

14:42.925 --> 14:44.009
Linda. Linda?

14:44.093 --> 14:47.012
<i>He ended up moving back to Milwaukee
to live with his parents.</i>

14:47.096 --> 14:49.848
<i>- He's lucky he's not in jail.</i>
- Linda!

14:52.726 --> 14:54.979
And ethics are the basis of...

14:55.062 --> 14:57.314
Okay. We'll pick up here next time.

15:02.820 --> 15:06.323
Would it be possible for me
to retake the test we took yesterday?

15:06.407 --> 15:09.952
- The test yesterday? You wanna retake it?
- Yeah. I had to work late the night before.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.413
- And I didn't have enough time to study.
- Oh, yeah?

15:13.414 --> 15:15.374
<i>Now that I have
more life experience,</i>

15:15.457 --> 15:17.543
<i>I feel sorry for Mr. McAllister.</i>

15:17.626 --> 15:20.796
<i>I mean, anyone who's stuck
in the same little room,</i>

15:20.879 --> 15:22.798
<i>wearing the same stupid clothes,</i>

15:22.881 --> 15:27.177
<i>saying the exact same things
year after year for his whole life,</i>

15:27.261 --> 15:29.638
<i>while his students go on to good colleges</i>

15:29.722 --> 15:34.018
<i>and move to big cities and do great things
and make loads of money...</i>

15:34.101 --> 15:35.394
Legislative.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.396
<i>...he's gotta be at least a little jealous.</i>

15:37.479 --> 15:40.399
- I noticed it was a little low for you.
<i>- It's like my mom says.</i>

15:40.482 --> 15:43.944
<i>The weak are always trying
to sabotage the strong.</i>

15:44.028 --> 15:47.948
<i>One thing that's important to know about me
is that I'm an only child,</i>

15:48.032 --> 15:50.492
<i>so my mom is really devoted to me.</i>

15:50.576 --> 15:52.494
<i>And I love her so much.</i>

15:52.578 --> 15:56.874
<i>She wants me to do all the things
that she wanted to do in life but couldn't.</i>

15:56.957 --> 16:01.003
<i>Mom used to be a stewardess for Northwest,
and now she works as a paralegal.</i>

16:01.086 --> 16:05.382
<i>She likes to write letters to successful women
like Elizabeth Dole and Connie Chung</i>

16:05.466 --> 16:07.384
<i>and ask them how they got to be
where they are</i>

16:07.468 --> 16:11.013
<i>and what advice do they have for me,
Tracy, her daughter.</i>

16:11.096 --> 16:15.643
<i>Nine times out of 10, they say you have to
hold onto your dreams no matter what.</i>

16:15.726 --> 16:18.771
<i>The pressures women face
mean you have to work twice as hard,</i>

16:18.854 --> 16:22.274
<i>and you can't let anything or anyone
stand in your way.</i>

16:22.358 --> 16:25.611
Hey! Hey! One per person!
Put those back!

16:25.694 --> 16:27.154
Eat me.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.282
<i>But you know,
winning isn't everything.</i>

16:30.366 --> 16:33.827
<i>Win or lose, ethical conduct
is the most important thing.</i>

16:33.911 --> 16:35.621
<i>Just ask Mr. McAllister.</i>

16:35.704 --> 16:39.208
Mr. McAllister! Mr. McAllister, wait up!

16:39.875 --> 16:41.460
Mr. McAllister, don't go!

16:45.214 --> 16:46.924
I got all my signatures.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.803
- There's 158, way more than I need.
- Hey, that's super.

16:50.886 --> 16:52.471
Here they are.

16:52.554 --> 16:55.325
Oh, you can just put them in my box,
and I'll take a look at them tomorrow.

16:55.349 --> 16:56.934
Could you approve them now?

16:57.017 --> 17:00.688
Because I'd really like to kick off my campaign
right away, you know, in the morning.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.189
Right.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.196
Yeah, yeah. Those look good to me.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.992
- Aren't you supposed to keep them?
- No. That's fine.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.538
I thought you were supposed to keep them.

17:19.164 --> 17:21.125
Yeah, right, fine. Okay.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.210
- Thanks for everything.
- You bet.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.800
I can't wait to start campaigning.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.177
- What's that?
- I can't wait to start campaigning.

17:32.261 --> 17:35.431
Oh. Well, it should be easy for you.
So far, no competition.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.851
Yeah, but you know, Coca-Cola's by far
the world's number-one soft drink,

17:38.934 --> 17:41.520
and they spend more money
than anybody on advertising.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.106
I guess that's how come
they stay number one.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.608
Yeah.

17:46.692 --> 17:48.527
Okay. Well, good luck there, Tracy.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.238
You know, Mr. M?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.074
When I win the presidency,

17:54.158 --> 17:56.785
that means you and I are gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

17:56.869 --> 17:59.955
and I, for one,
would really like that time to be

18:00.038 --> 18:02.583
harmonious and productive.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.002
Wouldn't you?

18:06.211 --> 18:07.421
Sure.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.426
Okay. That's what I thought.
I was just checking.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.845
Yeah. Good luck there, Tracy.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.138
Okay!

18:22.269 --> 18:24.855
<i>I don't blame Tracy
for what happened with Dave.</i>

18:24.938 --> 18:28.192
<i>How could I? Dave was an adult,
more than twice her age.</i>

18:29.651 --> 18:32.780
<i>Sure, she got on my nerves
once in a while, but I admired Tracy.</i>

18:32.863 --> 18:34.615
<i>I really did.</i>

18:36.992 --> 18:38.786
<i>Thank God for Diane.</i>

18:38.869 --> 18:42.539
<i>She was my best friend,
my source of love and strength.</i>

18:42.623 --> 18:47.044
<i>Oh, sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times,
but we'd always seen them through.</i>

18:47.127 --> 18:50.506
<i>After nine years of marriage,
we were closer than ever.</i>

18:52.341 --> 18:53.550
Anything wrong?

18:55.052 --> 18:56.637
No. No.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.555
Just, you know, school.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.438
<i>When I win the presidency,</i>

19:06.522 --> 19:09.691
<i>we're gonna be spending a lot of time together.</i>

19:09.775 --> 19:13.529
<i>Lots and lots and lots of time.</i>

19:14.446 --> 19:17.199
President and adviser.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.743
Harmonious and productive.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.746
Close and special.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.791
You... and I.

19:58.407 --> 19:59.658
<i>Hey, P.J.</i>

19:59.741 --> 20:01.743
<i>What are you doing here
in the boys' locker room?</i>

20:01.827 --> 20:04.288
<i>I've come to see the star quarterback
before the big game.</i>

20:04.371 --> 20:06.623
<i>But what if Coach Henderson walks in?</i>

20:06.707 --> 20:09.084
<i>Oh, that's okay. I took care of him.</i>

20:09.167 --> 20:11.837
<i>So, uh, what you reading?</i>

20:11.920 --> 20:13.839
<i>I'm just reviewing my playbook.</i>

20:13.922 --> 20:16.550
<i>I have a play we can practice.</i>

20:16.633 --> 20:19.511
<i>You be quarterback. I'll be tight end.</i>

20:31.481 --> 20:36.653
<i>You know, Coca-Cola is by far
the world's number-one soft drink.</i>

20:45.662 --> 20:46.914
Paul.

20:46.997 --> 20:47.997
Aaah!

20:58.842 --> 21:02.679
<i>I was so mad at God when I broke my leg
at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break.</i>

21:02.763 --> 21:05.390
Why?

21:05.474 --> 21:08.769
<i>The doctors told me I'd have to quit sports
for at least a couple of years,</i>

21:08.852 --> 21:10.145
<i>if not forever,</i>

21:10.228 --> 21:13.607
<i>which meant no first-string quarterback
in the fall.</i>

21:13.690 --> 21:15.776
<i>It was like the end of my life.</i>

21:15.859 --> 21:18.779
<i>When I got back to school,
everybody was so supportive,</i>

21:18.862 --> 21:21.657
<i>and they all wanted to sign my cast
and everything,</i>

21:21.740 --> 21:26.161
<i>but I still couldn't shake the feeling
that now my life had no purpose.</i>

21:26.244 --> 21:28.372
<i>What did God want from me?</i>

21:28.455 --> 21:30.415
<i>Why did I exist?</i>

21:30.499 --> 21:34.127
<i>Sometimes you can search
everywhere for answers.</i>

21:34.211 --> 21:38.590
<i>Then one day, destiny just walks up
and taps you on the shoulder.</i>

21:38.674 --> 21:40.717
<i>I know because it happened to me.</i>

21:42.928 --> 21:45.639
Paul, can I speak to you for a minute?

21:45.722 --> 21:48.684
<i>Mr. McAllister changed my life.</i>

21:48.767 --> 21:51.770
<i>And no matter what they say
he did or did not do,</i>

21:51.853 --> 21:53.855
<i>I believe he is a good man.</i>

21:53.939 --> 21:55.148
Paul...

21:56.525 --> 21:59.111
I know you've been pretty down
since your accident.

21:59.194 --> 22:03.824
Yeah, I... I wanted to play football
again so bad I could taste it.

22:03.907 --> 22:07.202
- And maybe go on to the play-offs and...
- Yeah, I know.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.329
I understand disappointment.
I really do.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.456
Yeah.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.459
Now, I personally think you have
a very bright future ahead of you.

22:14.543 --> 22:16.962
And I'm not talking about
the fleeting glory of sports.

22:17.045 --> 22:20.048
- What do you mean?
- Let me give you a clue.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.467
You're a natural-born leader.

22:22.551 --> 22:25.012
You're one of the most
popular students at Carver.

22:25.095 --> 22:28.098
You're honest, you're straightforward,
and you don't crack under pressure,

22:28.181 --> 22:31.852
as we all saw in the amazing
fourth quarter against Westside.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.937
All the kids look up to you.

22:34.021 --> 22:35.814
Now, what does that spell?

22:41.903 --> 22:45.490
Student... council... president.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.243
Who, me?

22:48.326 --> 22:49.619
Oh, no. I...

22:50.537 --> 22:53.206
I don't know anything about that stuff,
Mr. M.

22:53.290 --> 22:56.436
I mean, besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing.
She's always working so hard at it.

22:56.460 --> 22:59.046
Yeah, I know.
She's a real go-getter, all right.

22:59.129 --> 23:00.964
And she's super-nice.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.258
Yeah. Yeah.

23:03.341 --> 23:07.179
But one person assured of victory kind of,
uh, undermines the whole idea of democracy.

23:07.262 --> 23:08.764
- Don't you think?
- But, Mr. M...

23:08.847 --> 23:12.100
I mean, that'd be more like a dictatorship,
like we studied.

23:12.184 --> 23:15.479
- But, Mr. M, there's...
- Paul, what's your favourite fruit?

23:16.938 --> 23:18.065
Pears.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.734
Pears. Good. Okay.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.986
- Let's say all you ever had was —
- Oh, no, wait.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.488
Apples.

23:25.614 --> 23:27.365
Apples. Fine.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.410
Let's say all you ever knew were apples.

23:30.494 --> 23:33.789
Apples, apples, and more apples.

23:33.872 --> 23:38.210
You might think apples were pretty good,
even if you got a rotten one once in a while.

23:38.293 --> 23:41.004
But then one day there's an orange.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.715
And now you can make a decision.

23:43.799 --> 23:47.052
Do you want an apple
or do you want an orange?

23:47.135 --> 23:48.678
That's democracy.

23:48.762 --> 23:50.806
I also like bananas.

23:50.889 --> 23:53.850
Exactly. Good.

23:54.518 --> 23:58.355
So what do you say? Maybe it's time
to give a little something back.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.107
How's that?

24:00.190 --> 24:03.276
I think that's... No. Just a little higher.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.820
- A little higher.
- Is this okay?

24:04.903 --> 24:07.823
Eric, you can't put tape
on the outside of the poster.

24:07.906 --> 24:10.534
It goes on the back of the poster.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.453
You better just take the whole thing down
and redo it.

24:29.386 --> 24:31.763
- Who put you up to this?
- Oh, hi, Tracy.

24:31.847 --> 24:34.307
- Who put you up to this?
- What do you mean?

24:34.391 --> 24:37.769
You just woke up this morning
and suddenly decided to run for president?

24:37.853 --> 24:41.189
No. Um, no. I-I just thought that, uh —

24:41.273 --> 24:42.774
Thought what?

24:42.858 --> 24:45.944
Well, I was talking to Mr. McAllister
about my leg

24:46.027 --> 24:48.822
and how I still want to do something
for the school and —

24:48.905 --> 24:50.490
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.

24:50.574 --> 24:53.827
Well, um, I talked to him and everything,

24:53.910 --> 24:56.830
but he just said that he thought
it would be a good idea,

24:56.913 --> 24:59.708
and how there's all different kinds
of fruits and, um —

24:59.791 --> 25:03.253
And, well, it's nothing against you, Tracy.
I mean, you're the best.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.881
- Uh, I-I just thought, uh —
- Okay.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.549
You're on, Mr. Popular.

25:10.468 --> 25:14.181
<i>You might think it upset me that
Paul Metzler had decided to run against me.</i>

25:14.264 --> 25:16.308
<i>But nothing could be further from the truth.</i>

25:16.391 --> 25:19.352
<i>He was no competition for me.
It was like apples and oranges.</i>

25:19.436 --> 25:22.480
<i>I had to work a little harder, that's all.</i>

25:22.564 --> 25:24.858
<i>You see, I believe in the voters.</i>

25:24.941 --> 25:28.612
<i>They understand that elections
aren't just popularity contests.</i>

25:28.695 --> 25:33.658
<i>They know this country was built by people
just like me who work very hard</i>

25:33.742 --> 25:36.828
<i>and don't have everything handed to them
on a silver spoon.</i>

25:38.455 --> 25:40.790
<i>Not like some rich kids
who everybody likes</i>

25:40.874 --> 25:45.003
<i>because their fathers own Metzler Cement
and give them trucks on their 16th birthday</i>

25:45.086 --> 25:47.005
<i>and throw them big parties all the time.</i>

25:47.088 --> 25:49.674
<i>No. They don't ever have to
work for anything.</i>

25:49.758 --> 25:52.358
<i>They think they can just, all of a sudden,
one day out of the blue</i>

25:52.385 --> 25:54.930
<i>waltz right in
with no qualifications whatsoever</i>

25:55.013 --> 25:57.515
<i>and try to take away
what other people have worked for</i>

25:57.599 --> 26:00.644
<i>very, very hard their entire lives!</i>

26:00.727 --> 26:02.854
<i>No! Didn't bother me at all!</i>

26:03.980 --> 26:06.399
Paul.

26:06.483 --> 26:08.401
Paul Power.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.114
Paul... Paul for President.

26:13.198 --> 26:14.741
Paul for President.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.534
Promise.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.286
Progress.

26:18.370 --> 26:19.955
Peanut.

26:38.932 --> 26:41.643
<i>♪ There's a place I know ♪</i>

26:44.062 --> 26:47.899
<i>♪ Where you can look down ♪</i>

26:49.901 --> 26:53.905
<i>♪ The air makes you feel light ♪</i>

26:56.074 --> 26:58.952
<i>- ♪ The air makes you feel right ♪</i>
- What?

26:59.035 --> 27:02.038
I told you. I can't.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.957
It just doesn't feel right anymore.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.418
<i>♪ The road I'm travelin' ♪</i>

27:06.501 --> 27:07.961
But I love you.

27:10.171 --> 27:12.465
I said no.

27:13.925 --> 27:15.802
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.

27:15.885 --> 27:17.846
- Don't you fucking knock?
- Yeah.

27:17.929 --> 27:19.639
Oh, hi, Lisa.

27:19.723 --> 27:21.308
- Get — Get out, Paul!
- Listen.

27:21.391 --> 27:24.853
- So Mr. McAllister calls me in and tells me —
- I gotta go.

27:27.272 --> 27:29.607
- You dumb shit!
- What'd I do?

27:30.734 --> 27:33.069
<i>It's not like I'm a lesbian or anything.</i>

27:33.153 --> 27:34.946
<i>I'm attracted to the person.</i>

27:35.030 --> 27:38.700
<i>It's just that all the people I've ever
been attracted to happen to be girls.</i>

27:40.994 --> 27:42.579
Lisa, wait!

27:45.165 --> 27:46.666
Stop!

27:50.545 --> 27:52.255
- What?
- Where are you going?

27:53.381 --> 27:54.883
I'm not like you, okay?

27:54.966 --> 27:56.801
What do you mean?

27:56.885 --> 27:58.720
I'm not a dyke.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.847
And we're not in love.

28:00.930 --> 28:04.100
We were just... experimenting.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.658
<i>How can something
that seemed so true</i>

28:20.742 --> 28:23.328
<i>turn out to be such a lie?</i>

28:29.250 --> 28:31.795
<i>Lisa and I were destined to be together.</i>

28:31.878 --> 28:34.589
<i>Of all the people on the planet
who had ever lived,</i>

28:34.672 --> 28:37.008
<i>somehow we'd found each other.</i>

28:37.092 --> 28:39.219
<i>It was like a miracle.</i>

28:41.805 --> 28:43.556
<i>We had so much fun together,</i>

28:43.640 --> 28:45.934
<i>like the time we ate a bunch of asparagus</i>

28:46.017 --> 28:48.137
<i>to see how long it takes
before your pee smells funny.</i>

28:49.354 --> 28:51.398
<i>It was very scientific.</i>

28:51.481 --> 28:54.734
<i>For me, it was 11 minutes.
For her, it was 17.</i>

28:56.569 --> 29:00.865
<i>Every day I found a new way
to tell Lisa how much I loved her.</i>

29:02.033 --> 29:03.743
<i>"If you died right now,</i>

29:03.827 --> 29:06.621
<i>I would throw myself
into one of my dad's cement trucks</i>

29:06.704 --> 29:08.706
<i>and get poured into your tomb."</i>

29:11.209 --> 29:15.797
<i>But it just seemed like the closer we got,
the more she pulled away.</i>

29:16.631 --> 29:18.341
- Are you crazy?
- What?

29:18.425 --> 29:20.927
- These are private. These are for us.
- So?

29:21.010 --> 29:24.180
- But other people can see them too.
- I don't care.

29:25.014 --> 29:26.349
Well, I do.

29:26.433 --> 29:29.602
<i>♪ I can't get along without you now ♪</i>

29:29.686 --> 29:31.980
<i>What did I do to make her change?</i>

29:33.481 --> 29:35.483
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

29:38.486 --> 29:40.447
<i>Sometimes when I'm sad,</i>

29:40.530 --> 29:43.575
<i>I sit and watch the power station.</i>

29:43.658 --> 29:46.578
<i>They say if you lie
between two of the main wires,</i>

29:46.661 --> 29:48.705
<i>your body just evaporates.</i>

29:48.788 --> 29:50.457
<i>You become a gas.</i>

29:51.332 --> 29:53.418
<i>I wonder what that would feel like.</i>

30:01.217 --> 30:02.802
<i>I don't know why,</i>

30:02.886 --> 30:05.680
<i>but Lisa decided she wanted to hurt me.</i>

30:05.763 --> 30:08.099
<i>And she knew exactly what to do.</i>

30:10.768 --> 30:14.230
<i>I sure was surprised the day
Lisa Flanagan asked me for a ride home</i>

30:14.314 --> 30:16.316
<i>and ended up blowing me.</i>

30:17.692 --> 30:20.028
I've wanted this for so long.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.573
<i>I mean, life is so weird.</i>

30:23.656 --> 30:26.576
<i>First, Lisa has a big fight with my sister,</i>

30:26.659 --> 30:29.204
<i>and the next thing you know
she's my girlfriend.</i>

30:30.330 --> 30:33.249
<i>Since Lisa knew
all about public relations and stuff,</i>

30:33.333 --> 30:35.460
<i>she offered to help me with my campaign.</i>

30:35.543 --> 30:37.462
<i>We made a great team.</i>

30:37.545 --> 30:40.632
<i>It seemed so natural,
the two of us together.</i>

30:40.715 --> 30:42.717
<i>It was like a miracle.</i>

30:45.678 --> 30:49.140
<i>My leg wasn't bugging me too much
and the weather was so nice.</i>

30:49.224 --> 30:51.768
<i>And every day after school
Lisa and I would go to her house</i>

30:51.851 --> 30:53.853
<i>to fuck and have a hot tub.</i>

31:14.707 --> 31:17.752
<i>If that's the way they wanted it,
then that's the way it was gonna be.</i>

31:17.835 --> 31:20.755
<i>But I wasn't going down without a fight.</i>

31:27.136 --> 31:28.805
Tammy?

31:30.265 --> 31:32.308
Tammy, what are you doing?

31:32.392 --> 31:34.310
You're the adviser.
You should stop her.

31:34.394 --> 31:37.313
She's not qualified. She's just a sophomore.
Did you know that?

31:37.397 --> 31:39.148
Calm down, Tracy.
Just calm down.

31:39.232 --> 31:42.860
We can't both run, can we?
I mean, we're brother and sister.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.488
- Can we?
- It's a conflict of interest, and Paul was first.

31:45.572 --> 31:50.201
Anybody who gets signatures in on time can run,
and she got in just under the wire.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.247
These are a bunch of burnouts!

31:54.330 --> 31:57.834
A-And what's this one?
It's "illegible." I can't even read that.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.253
That's Tim... Cobsa.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.338
She's doing this to get back at me.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.341
- For what?
- I mean, at you.

32:06.342 --> 32:07.552
For what?

32:08.261 --> 32:09.345
Tim Cobsa?

32:10.346 --> 32:12.473
Tim Cobsa? Who's he?
I've never even heard of him.

32:12.557 --> 32:15.977
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?
We'll have the assembly tomorrow.

32:16.060 --> 32:19.397
Everybody can make their speeches,
and I'm sure everything's gonna be just fine.

32:19.897 --> 32:21.190
Yay! Whee!

32:21.274 --> 32:23.276
Jim, don't. You're scaring him.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.361
Nah. He likes it.

32:25.445 --> 32:27.155
Ah, not that much.

32:27.238 --> 32:31.200
<i>Around that time, Diane and I were
hanging out a lot at Linda Novotny's house,</i>

32:31.284 --> 32:33.995
<i>giving her our love and support</i>

32:34.078 --> 32:36.289
<i>and helping her make it through
a difficult time.</i>

32:36.372 --> 32:38.791
Oh, honey.

32:42.378 --> 32:45.798
<i>Diane really wanted to have kids,
and so did I,</i>

32:45.882 --> 32:48.801
<i>but it seemed like there was
always a reason to wait.</i>

32:48.885 --> 32:52.180
<i>She had to finish nursing school,
I had to get my master's,</i>

32:52.263 --> 32:54.974
<i>we needed a new house,
we needed more money.</i>

32:55.058 --> 32:57.185
<i>Finally, we just decided to go for it.</i>

32:57.977 --> 33:00.229
Gonna do it? You gonna do it?

33:00.313 --> 33:02.815
<i>But for over a year,
we hadn't had any luck.</i>

33:02.899 --> 33:04.692
- Just a minute.
- Come on.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.486
Do it. Do it.

33:06.569 --> 33:09.572
- Fill me up. Come on. Fill me up.
- Yeah. Okay.

33:09.656 --> 33:11.658
Fill me up. Fill me up!

33:19.666 --> 33:21.918
Okay. Okay.

33:26.339 --> 33:28.049
Good job.

33:35.223 --> 33:37.642
<i>Say, Jim?</i>

33:37.725 --> 33:40.687
Jim, can you get this? I can't...

33:40.770 --> 33:42.605
Oh, yeah, sure.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.691
- Just put it on the table.
- All right.

33:49.445 --> 33:53.157
<i>Without Dave around,
Linda needed a lot of help around the house.</i>

33:53.241 --> 33:55.243
- Where do you want it, here?
- No.

33:56.577 --> 33:59.414
More this way.

33:59.497 --> 34:01.082
Here?

34:01.165 --> 34:03.501
Uh, yeah. That's good.

34:07.588 --> 34:09.257
<i>I had always liked Linda,</i>

34:09.340 --> 34:12.427
<i>but we'd never had a chance
to spend any time alone together.</i>

34:12.510 --> 34:14.554
Oughta warm you up a little bit.

34:14.637 --> 34:16.304
<i>Now with Dave out of the picture,</i>

34:16.389 --> 34:20.184
<i>I began to see what an incredibly
sensitive and giving person she was.</i>

34:21.185 --> 34:23.646
<i>We got to be kind of like buddies.</i>

34:23.730 --> 34:27.024
<i>I even took her to the mall one time
while her car was in the shop.</i>

34:30.110 --> 34:31.529
What do you think?

34:33.030 --> 34:34.657
You look great.

34:34.741 --> 34:37.201
I can't afford this stuff right now.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.286
Aw, come on.
You've had a hard year.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.789
You're cooped up all the time with the kid.

34:41.873 --> 34:43.291
Let go. Live a little.

34:43.373 --> 34:44.876
- You sure?
- Yeah.

34:48.004 --> 34:50.005
So what do you think?

34:50.089 --> 34:52.717
- Should we get a room?
- Should we get a what?

35:05.396 --> 35:06.898
That's not funny.

35:15.782 --> 35:17.533
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

35:18.326 --> 35:20.912
You know. Just went to Westerly's.

35:21.621 --> 35:22.830
Did you guys have fun?

35:24.791 --> 35:27.335
Um... yeah.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.545
No, I mean... you know.

35:29.629 --> 35:32.006
What?

35:32.089 --> 35:34.550
Well, Linda's great,

35:35.301 --> 35:37.303
but she can be
a little bit much sometimes.

35:39.514 --> 35:40.807
Yeah.

35:40.890 --> 35:44.435
Oh, God. Oh, just like that. Yeah.

35:44.519 --> 35:47.939
Fill me up. Fill me up.

35:48.773 --> 35:50.900
Oh... yeah!

35:50.983 --> 35:52.443
Fill me up!

35:53.736 --> 35:57.198
Oh, God. Just like that. Oh, yeah.

35:57.281 --> 36:00.660
- Fill me up.
- God. Oh, God!

36:00.743 --> 36:02.745
- Oh, God. Just like that.
- Just like that.

36:02.829 --> 36:05.665
- Oh, yeah. Fuck me!
- Do it, Jim. Fuck me.

36:05.748 --> 36:08.000
Do it, Jim. Just like that.

36:08.084 --> 36:10.837
Do it, Jim. Fill me up.

36:10.920 --> 36:14.006
Just like that. Do it, Mr. M. Do it.

36:14.090 --> 36:16.175
Fuck me, Mr. M. Fuck me!

36:16.259 --> 36:19.720
Fuck me hard, Mr. McAllister!
Harder! Harder!

36:19.804 --> 36:22.348
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister!
Fuck me hard!

36:22.431 --> 36:24.684
Harder! Fuck me! Please!

36:26.435 --> 36:29.897
<i>So like I was saying,
things were going pretty well in my life.</i>

36:30.690 --> 36:34.151
<i>That is, until things started going all haywire
with that damn election.</i>

36:34.235 --> 36:37.113
I love Carver High,

36:37.196 --> 36:40.992
and I will be a dedicated vice president.

36:41.075 --> 36:44.287
A vote for Jerry Slavin
is a vote for good government,

36:44.370 --> 36:47.164
and even if I can't really
stand up for you, I will.

36:47.248 --> 36:50.585
Thank you.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.176
Thank you, Jerry.
Thank you and good luck.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.346
Again, Jerry is running unopposed
for vice president.

37:02.430 --> 37:06.058
So, we'll move on now
to the presidential race,

37:06.142 --> 37:08.269
with three candidates running.

37:08.352 --> 37:12.064
The first, in alphabetical order,
is Tracy Flick.

37:12.148 --> 37:15.151
Tracy?

37:21.157 --> 37:23.993
Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote,

37:24.076 --> 37:27.788
"I cannot make my days longer,
so I strive to make them better."

37:28.706 --> 37:31.918
With this election, we here at Carver
also have an opportunity

37:32.001 --> 37:34.003
to make our high school days better.

37:34.754 --> 37:36.213
During this campaign,

37:36.297 --> 37:39.884
I've spoken with many of you
about your many concerns.

37:39.967 --> 37:42.553
I spoke with Eliza Ramirez, a freshman,

37:42.637 --> 37:45.473
who said she feels alienated
from her own homeroom.

37:45.556 --> 37:47.975
I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks,

37:48.059 --> 37:50.311
who said his mother works in the cafeteria

37:50.394 --> 37:52.915
and can't afford to buy him
enough spiral notebooks for his classes.

37:52.939 --> 37:55.441
- Eat me!
- Eat me raw!

38:00.738 --> 38:01.948
All right, now —

38:02.698 --> 38:07.578
Hey, if you can't be adults and give
these candidates the courtesy they deserve,

38:07.662 --> 38:10.915
then you don't deserve
to be called adults, but children.

38:10.998 --> 38:14.210
Because that's what children are,
and you'll be treated like children.

38:14.293 --> 38:16.504
So let's all listen up, huh?

38:21.050 --> 38:24.804
I care about Carver,
and I care about each and every one of you.

38:24.887 --> 38:26.973
And together,
we can all make a difference.

38:28.057 --> 38:30.977
When you cast your vote
for Tracy Flick next week,

38:31.060 --> 38:33.396
you won't just be voting for me.

38:33.479 --> 38:37.733
You'll be voting for yourself
and for every other student here at Carver.

38:38.567 --> 38:42.154
Our days might not be any longer,
but they can sure be better.

38:42.238 --> 38:43.572
Thank you.

38:51.330 --> 38:55.960
The... The next candidate for
student body president is Paul Metzler.

38:56.043 --> 38:59.046
Paul?

39:05.886 --> 39:08.597
- Paul!
- Paul!

39:18.024 --> 39:19.483
You're the man!

39:29.160 --> 39:32.288
"As many of you know,
I broke my leg pretty bad this year,

39:32.371 --> 39:35.708
and the experience has made me reevaluate
what I want to do with my life,

39:35.791 --> 39:37.334
and that is help people.

39:37.418 --> 39:40.046
When you think about it,
a school is more than a school.

39:40.129 --> 39:42.214
It's our second home,
where we spend all our time

39:42.298 --> 39:45.009
and grow as individuals in the community.

39:45.092 --> 39:47.053
But is our school everything it could be?

39:47.136 --> 39:50.014
I want our school
to reach its true potential.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.016
That's why I'm running for president.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.018
I know what it is to fight hard and win,

39:54.101 --> 39:56.312
like when we almost went to State last fall

39:56.395 --> 39:59.156
and I threw the fourth-quarter pass
against Westside for the touchdown

39:59.231 --> 40:00.858
that won the game by three points.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.777
I won't let you down like I didn't then,

40:02.860 --> 40:06.280
and I promise we can all score
a winning touchdown together.

40:06.363 --> 40:08.908
Vote Paul Metzler for president.
Thank you."

40:22.671 --> 40:24.507
Okay, Paul.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.676
The final candidate
for student council president

40:27.760 --> 40:31.305
is another one of the Metzler clan,
sophomore Tammy Metzler.

40:31.388 --> 40:32.515
Tammy.

40:46.445 --> 40:48.948
People! People!

40:53.744 --> 40:57.164
Who cares about this stupid election?

41:02.294 --> 41:06.382
We all know it doesn't matter
who gets elected president of Carver.

41:07.341 --> 41:10.761
Do you really think it's gonna change
anything around here,

41:10.845 --> 41:13.764
make one single person smarter,

41:13.848 --> 41:15.349
or happier,

41:15.432 --> 41:16.809
or nicer?

41:17.768 --> 41:21.939
The only person it does matter to
is the one who gets elected.

41:22.022 --> 41:26.110
The same pathetic charade
happens every year,

41:26.193 --> 41:29.280
and everyone makes
the same pathetic promises

41:29.363 --> 41:32.575
just so they can put it on their transcripts
to get into college.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.035
So vote for me,

41:35.119 --> 41:38.372
because I don't even want to go to college,
and I don't care.

41:38.455 --> 41:40.916
And as president, I won't do anything.

41:42.251 --> 41:45.713
The only promise I will make
is that, if elected,

41:45.796 --> 41:48.841
I will immediately dismantle
the student government

41:48.924 --> 41:52.636
so that none of us will ever have to sit through
one of these stupid assemblies again!

41:57.099 --> 41:59.685
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

41:59.768 --> 42:03.105
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!

42:03.189 --> 42:07.651
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
Tammy! Tammy!

42:07.735 --> 42:11.989
Or don't vote for me! Who cares?
Don't vote at all!

42:31.050 --> 42:32.635
Close the door.

42:33.636 --> 42:37.806
I tell you, that little bitch
made a fool out of us.

42:37.890 --> 42:40.142
I want her out of this election.

42:40.226 --> 42:42.269
I mean,
getting everybody all riled up like that.

42:42.353 --> 42:44.980
She is washed up. You understand me?
She's finished.

42:45.064 --> 42:48.692
Well, we can't throw her out of the election
just because we don't like her speech.

42:48.776 --> 42:50.778
That's not what
student government is about.

42:52.154 --> 42:54.406
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

42:54.490 --> 42:57.826
Look, all I know is she's a troublemaker.
She's on my list.

42:57.910 --> 43:00.454
All we need to do is send a message.

43:00.537 --> 43:03.540
Uh, so maybe, uh,
we should just suspend her.

43:05.960 --> 43:09.046
That's it. Three days.
She's suspended for three days.

43:13.467 --> 43:16.428
<i>Being suspended
is like getting a paid vacation.</i>

43:16.512 --> 43:18.472
<i>Why do they think it's a punishment?</i>

43:18.555 --> 43:21.850
<i>It's like your dog pees on the carpet
and you give him a treat.</i>

43:21.934 --> 43:25.938
<i>Then you get in trouble for skipping school.
It's so stupid.</i>

43:26.021 --> 43:29.441
<i>Hendricks told me,
"One more time" and I'd be expelled.</i>

43:29.525 --> 43:31.193
<i>Sounded good to me.</i>

44:02.766 --> 44:05.519
Whoo! You got it! You got it!

44:05.602 --> 44:06.937
Over here!

44:07.021 --> 44:08.772
Right here! Come on! Right here!

44:31.837 --> 44:33.589
Oh. Hi, Tammy.

44:35.632 --> 44:37.259
What do you want?

44:37.343 --> 44:40.763
Well, I went to all your teachers
and got your assignments for you.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.973
I... I just thought, you know,

44:43.057 --> 44:45.059
last time you got suspended
you fell so far behind,

44:45.142 --> 44:47.895
and I just didn't want to
see that happen again.

44:47.978 --> 44:49.563
Thanks, Paul. Thanks a lot.

44:49.646 --> 44:51.565
Sure. You bet.

44:53.525 --> 44:56.528
- Now could you leave me alone?
- Oh. Yeah.

44:56.612 --> 45:00.616
Um, Tammy, there's just one other thing.

45:00.699 --> 45:02.576
You know all this election stuff?

45:02.659 --> 45:06.259
'Cause everybody is saying it's really weird
that you're running against me and everything.

45:06.288 --> 45:08.082
And it is kind of weird.

45:08.165 --> 45:11.377
You haven't really told me why you're doing it
and didn't tell me in advance.

45:11.460 --> 45:14.463
But that's okay. I respect your privacy.

45:14.546 --> 45:19.218
It's just, I want you to know that
no matter who wins, you or me,

45:19.301 --> 45:21.220
there's no hard feelings.

45:21.303 --> 45:25.099
We're still brother and sister, okay?
Even though you're adopted, because —

45:26.141 --> 45:28.060
I-I hope you feel the same.

45:32.856 --> 45:36.360
<i>What happened at the speeches
was an "unconscience-able" travesty.</i>

45:36.443 --> 45:39.655
<i>That little bitch Tammy Metzler
wanted to make a fool out of me.</i>

45:39.738 --> 45:41.824
<i>Well, it wasn't gonna work.</i>

45:41.907 --> 45:44.535
<i>If all those students
who cheered for Tammy Metzler</i>

45:44.618 --> 45:47.121
<i>only knew how hard I worked for Carver,</i>

45:47.204 --> 45:49.349
<i>like all the late nights
I spend at the yearbook office</i>

45:49.373 --> 45:51.375
<i>just to give them their stinking memories.</i>

45:56.755 --> 45:59.466
<i>One of my duties
was to clean up the group photos.</i>

46:00.843 --> 46:03.053
<i>It was a cinch with our new software.</i>

46:05.597 --> 46:07.766
<i>People are so ungrateful.</i>

49:38.226 --> 49:41.563
<i>The day before the election is when
things started to get really complicated.</i>

49:43.357 --> 49:44.691
There's your culprit.

49:45.901 --> 49:48.570
<i>Linda had asked me
to stop by on my way to school</i>

49:48.654 --> 49:51.823
<i>to help her out
with a little plumbing problem.</i>

49:51.907 --> 49:53.617
Did you know Dave's a bed-wetter?

49:55.577 --> 49:58.372
No. No, I-I didn't know that.

49:58.455 --> 50:00.624
All his life. He's tried everything.

50:00.707 --> 50:01.917
Oh?

50:04.670 --> 50:06.838
Is that still running clear?

50:06.922 --> 50:08.006
Yeah.

50:08.715 --> 50:11.009
- Better let it run for a while.
- Okay.

50:11.927 --> 50:13.470
Oh, wait.

50:14.388 --> 50:16.682
Here. This one's clean.

50:20.519 --> 50:23.188
Well, I guess you better get to work, huh?

50:23.271 --> 50:25.857
- You're gonna be late.
- Yeah.

50:38.245 --> 50:39.871
Thank you, Jim.

50:53.844 --> 50:56.179
<i>It was something that just happened.</i>

50:56.263 --> 50:59.474
<i>Neither of us expected it.
Neither of us planned it.</i>

50:59.558 --> 51:03.103
<i>But once we started,
we knew there was no turning back.</i>

51:03.937 --> 51:05.564
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

51:06.732 --> 51:08.400
Oh, Jim.

51:20.078 --> 51:23.331
Hey, take me to that motel,
like you wanted.

51:24.374 --> 51:26.960
- Now?
- Um, come by after school.

51:27.043 --> 51:29.129
- I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
- Oh.

51:30.464 --> 51:32.841
- 3:25.
- Okay. 3:25.

51:42.893 --> 51:44.895
<i>What had blossomed between Linda and me</i>

51:44.978 --> 51:48.356
<i>was too real, too powerful to deny.</i>

51:48.440 --> 51:51.735
<i>For the first time in years,
I felt free and alive.</i>

51:57.324 --> 52:01.745
Yeah, ciao. Ciao. Ciao.

52:21.056 --> 52:23.683
It's not fair. It's just not fair.

52:23.767 --> 52:27.062
I just don't think somebody would
do something like that on purpose.

52:27.145 --> 52:31.525
It must be some sort of mistake,
like a maintenance thing.

52:31.608 --> 52:34.611
Jim, where the hell have you been?

52:34.694 --> 52:39.074
Nowhere. No, I-I just don't have
any classes till second period.

52:39.157 --> 52:42.160
Well, I tried you at home,
and we've got a situation here.

52:42.244 --> 52:46.331
If Paul loses this election tomorrow,
there has to be another one with posters.

52:46.414 --> 52:48.166
Somebody tore down their posters.

52:48.250 --> 52:51.461
Those posters cost us a lot of money,
and there's no time to make any more.

52:51.545 --> 52:54.941
- All right, we'll get to the bottom of it.
- We still have some extra ones, don't we?

52:54.965 --> 52:57.605
- Maybe we could just use those.
- It was Tammy. That's who it was.

52:57.634 --> 53:01.388
Oh, no. Hey, like I said,
she just wouldn't do something like that.

53:01.471 --> 53:05.183
Well, that speech that she gave,
you know, it was pretty...

53:05.267 --> 53:06.726
It was out there.

53:06.810 --> 53:10.856
But we'll get to the bottom of it.
I want you two to go back.

53:10.939 --> 53:12.983
I want you to focus on your studies.

53:13.066 --> 53:15.819
Mr. McAllister
will handle the whole thing.

53:16.778 --> 53:18.989
- Right, Jim?
- What's that?

53:19.072 --> 53:21.658
Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah, you bet.

53:30.917 --> 53:32.419
Tracy.

53:36.047 --> 53:38.049
Tracy, come on in.

53:39.092 --> 53:41.094
Close the door behind you.

53:47.392 --> 53:49.019
Have a seat.

53:54.065 --> 53:56.401
I guess you know why you're here.

53:58.945 --> 54:01.823
If it's about the posters,
I think it's awful.

54:01.907 --> 54:04.659
- I think it's a travesty.
- Travesty, huh?

54:04.743 --> 54:06.912
Well, that's interesting...

54:08.705 --> 54:10.332
because I think you did it.

54:11.541 --> 54:13.043
What?

54:14.502 --> 54:17.797
Are you accusing me? You're not serious.

54:17.881 --> 54:22.052
Mr. McAllister, we've worked together
on the SGA for three solid years.

54:22.135 --> 54:25.555
Besides, my own best banner was torn down.
Did I do that too?

54:26.139 --> 54:30.018
Were you or were you not working
in the Looking Glass Office over the weekend?

54:30.101 --> 54:32.145
I was. So?

54:32.228 --> 54:34.105
Mr. Paterno let me in.

54:34.189 --> 54:37.943
As you know, with my many responsibilities,
I often have to come in on the weekend.

54:38.026 --> 54:40.153
And I have permission to do so.

54:40.236 --> 54:42.656
But I left very early, around 6:30.

54:44.532 --> 54:45.992
6:30.

54:46.076 --> 54:47.869
6:30.

54:47.953 --> 54:51.122
How do you know what time
the posters were torn down?

54:51.206 --> 54:54.751
I don't. I just know
that they were there when I left.

54:54.834 --> 54:56.836
I'm giving you helpful information,
that's all.

54:58.421 --> 55:00.483
You know, instead of wasting
your time interrogating me,

55:00.507 --> 55:02.926
we should be out there trying
to figure out who did this.

55:03.009 --> 55:05.178
Okay, Tracy.

55:05.261 --> 55:07.097
Who do you think did it?

55:07.180 --> 55:09.182
Whom should we interrogate?

55:09.265 --> 55:11.977
Well, I don't know.
You know, it could have been anybody.

55:12.060 --> 55:14.354
There's a lot of subversive elements
here at Carver,

55:14.437 --> 55:18.066
like Rick Thiessen or Kevin Speck
and those burnouts.

55:18.149 --> 55:19.651
Or what about Tammy Metzler?

55:19.734 --> 55:22.779
I mean, her whole thing
is being anti-this and anti-that.

55:24.656 --> 55:27.701
Tracy, you're a very intelligent girl.

55:27.784 --> 55:30.286
You have a lot of admirable qualities.

55:31.204 --> 55:33.748
But one day maybe you'll learn
that being smart

55:33.832 --> 55:36.251
and doing whatever
you need to do to get ahead

55:36.334 --> 55:39.129
and, yes,
stepping on other people to get there,

55:39.754 --> 55:42.382
well, there's a whole lot more
to life than that.

55:43.299 --> 55:45.677
And in the end,
you're only cheating yourself.

55:46.970 --> 55:49.055
Why are you lecturing me?

55:50.724 --> 55:53.476
This isn't the time or the place
to get into it.

55:54.352 --> 55:58.148
But there is, for just one example,
a certain former colleague of mine

55:58.231 --> 56:01.901
who made a very big mistake,
a life mistake.

56:01.985 --> 56:07.157
Now, I think the lesson here is that,
old or young, we all make mistakes.

56:07.240 --> 56:10.326
And we have to learn that our actions,
all of them,

56:10.410 --> 56:13.038
can carry serious consequences.

56:14.330 --> 56:16.082
Mm-hmm.

56:16.166 --> 56:20.503
I don't know what you're referring to,
but maybe if certain older, wiser people

56:20.587 --> 56:23.965
hadn't acted like such little babies
and gotten so mushy,

56:24.049 --> 56:25.842
then everything would be okay.

56:25.925 --> 56:27.677
I agree.

56:27.761 --> 56:30.680
And I also think that
certain young and naive people

56:30.764 --> 56:34.184
need to thank their lucky stars
and be very, very grateful

56:34.267 --> 56:38.563
that the entire school didn't find out
about certain indiscretions

56:38.646 --> 56:43.568
that could've ruined their reputations
and their chances to win certain elections.

56:43.651 --> 56:47.572
And I think certain older people,
like you and your colleague,

56:47.655 --> 56:49.657
shouldn't be letching after their students,

56:49.741 --> 56:52.494
especially when some of them
can't even get their own wives pregnant.

56:53.495 --> 56:56.331
And they certainly shouldn't be
making slanderous accusations,

56:56.414 --> 56:59.250
especially when certain young,
naive people's mothers

56:59.334 --> 57:02.045
are paralegal secretaries
at the city's biggest law firm

57:02.128 --> 57:04.839
and have won many successful lawsuits.

57:04.923 --> 57:06.966
And if you want to keep
questioning me like this,

57:07.050 --> 57:09.844
I won't continue without my attorney present.

57:15.058 --> 57:17.018
You wanted to see me, Mr. McAllister?

57:17.102 --> 57:19.354
Just wait outside, Tammy.

57:19.437 --> 57:22.357
Okay, but is this about the posters?

57:22.440 --> 57:25.068
Possibly. Please, just wait outside.

57:25.735 --> 57:28.404
Okay, because I know who did it.

57:29.072 --> 57:31.157
So, I'll just be outside.

57:34.994 --> 57:37.997
Don't go anywhere, Tracy.
Tammy, come on in here.

57:40.208 --> 57:42.210
This ought to be good.

57:45.088 --> 57:47.257
So, what do you have to tell me, Tammy?

57:48.049 --> 57:49.968
Well, this is hard for me,

57:50.051 --> 57:53.054
but I think it's important to be honest,
don't you?

57:53.138 --> 57:54.848
Yeah. What is it, Tammy?

57:56.099 --> 58:00.061
I did it.
I'm the one who tore down Paul's posters.

58:01.146 --> 58:02.981
I did it.

58:03.064 --> 58:06.860
- When did you do it?
- I don't know. Yesterday, Sunday.

58:07.902 --> 58:09.529
How'd you get into the school?

58:11.114 --> 58:13.408
- Door was open.
- Which door?

58:14.742 --> 58:16.786
I don't know. All I know is I did it.

58:16.870 --> 58:18.788
Well, I don't believe you.

58:18.872 --> 58:20.874
I have proof.

58:47.567 --> 58:48.860
- Tracy?
- Yes?

58:49.944 --> 58:51.779
Looks like today's your lucky day.

58:51.863 --> 58:55.408
You're off the hook.
Tammy here has confessed.

59:07.170 --> 59:08.713
I told you.

59:09.756 --> 59:12.675
I told you.
You're gonna pay for my poster!

59:12.759 --> 59:15.678
Okay, easy, now. Now, quit
while you're ahead, will you, Tracy?

59:15.762 --> 59:18.223
Just run along. Back to class.

59:18.306 --> 59:20.308
<i>The rest of the day was unbearable.</i>

59:20.391 --> 59:24.145
<i>I kept smelling Linda
on my clothes and on my fingers,</i>

59:24.229 --> 59:26.564
<i>and I just couldn't wait
to get out of there.</i>

59:29.359 --> 59:32.904
<i>I wanted everything to be perfect
that afternoon at the motel,</i>

59:32.987 --> 59:36.950
<i>so I decided to give myself a little time
to prepare during eighth period.</i>

59:37.033 --> 59:39.869
Pop quiz, everybody.

59:39.953 --> 59:42.330
Put your stuff away.
Come on. No whining.

59:42.413 --> 59:44.613
If you've done your reading,
this should be an easy one.

59:46.501 --> 59:48.962
<i>I'd have exactly 48 minutes
to make all the arrangements.</i>

59:49.045 --> 59:51.756
If you finish early,
just sit quietly and check your work.

59:51.839 --> 59:53.675
I'll be right back.

01:01:12.295 --> 01:01:14.130
Okay, everybody. Pass 'em forward.

01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:17.050
Stephanie, put your pen down. Stop.

01:01:18.343 --> 01:01:21.679
All right, see you all on Wednesday.
Don't forget to vote tomorrow.

01:02:02.512 --> 01:02:04.013
Linda.

01:02:06.808 --> 01:02:08.226
Linda.

01:02:12.939 --> 01:02:14.440
Linda!

01:02:23.449 --> 01:02:24.992
Linda!

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.121
Linda.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.422
Ow!

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:41.551
Ow!

01:02:41.634 --> 01:02:43.719
Jesus.

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:46.222
Oh, fuck!

01:02:54.105 --> 01:02:56.023
<i>Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.</i>

01:02:56.107 --> 01:02:58.443
<i>We're not around,
but we'll call you back real soon.</i>

01:02:58.526 --> 01:03:00.695
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:04.907
Hey, Linda. It's me.
Are you there? Pick up.

01:03:04.991 --> 01:03:06.534
Um —

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:09.662
Okay, well, it's, uh — it's 4:32,

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:14.584
and, uh, I came by at 3:25, like we said,

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:19.505
and, uh, I waited there,
but, um, you weren't there,

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:24.844
so — so now I'm at the —
at the place that we talked about.

01:03:24.927 --> 01:03:27.847
Suite 246.

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:30.892
And I'm here.

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:36.022
Everything's all set,
so, uh, hope you get here soon.

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:37.815
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:03:43.905 --> 01:03:46.741
I don't get it. I just don't get it.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:50.328
What you have against your mother and me,
against your brother Paul,

01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:52.872
is completely beyond me.

01:03:52.955 --> 01:03:56.918
Your mother's extremely upset.
She's at the end of her rope.

01:03:57.001 --> 01:04:01.797
Your behaviour keeps getting crazier
and crazier and wilder and wilder.

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:06.302
Who knows what the hell else you're doing
out there that we don't even know about?

01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:10.014
We just had a long conversation
with Walt Hendricks.

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.726
Just got off the phone with him at his home.

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:15.853
You know he doesn't want you
back at Carver.

01:04:16.604 --> 01:04:19.065
He's fed up with you. Fed up.

01:04:19.148 --> 01:04:20.775
- And I don't blame him.
- Dick, Dick.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:22.318
What?

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:26.864
Tammy, your father and I have been talking,
and we've come to a decision that we —

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:31.077
You're going to Immaculate Heart.
That's where you belong.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.746
Maybe the nuns
will be able to straighten you out.

01:04:35.248 --> 01:04:38.042
Is that funny? You think it's funny?

01:06:09.759 --> 01:06:11.052
Okay.

01:06:16.057 --> 01:06:17.558
Shh.

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:03.938
<i>Dear Lord Jesus,</i>

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:06.565
<i>I do not often speak with you
and ask for things,</i>

01:07:06.649 --> 01:07:10.319
<i>but now I really must insist
that you help me win the election tomorrow,</i>

01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:12.863
<i>because I deserve it
and Paul Metzler doesn't,</i>

01:07:12.947 --> 01:07:14.699
<i>as you well know.</i>

01:07:14.782 --> 01:07:18.494
<i>I realize that it was your divine hand
that disqualified Tammy Metzler,</i>

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:21.414
<i>and now I'm asking
that you go that one last mile</i>

01:07:21.497 --> 01:07:23.833
<i>and make sure to put me in office
where I belong</i>

01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:27.253
<i>so that I may carry out your will on earth
as it is in heaven.</i>

01:07:27.336 --> 01:07:28.838
<i>Amen.</i>

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:31.799
<i>Dear God, I know I don't believe in you,</i>

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:33.884
<i>but since I'll be starting
Catholic school soon,</i>

01:07:33.968 --> 01:07:36.011
<i>I thought I should at least practice.</i>

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:38.389
<i>Let's see. What do I want?</i>

01:07:38.472 --> 01:07:41.809
<i>I want Lisa to realize what a bitch she is
and feel really bad</i>

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:44.019
<i>and apologize for how she hurt me</i>

01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:46.355
<i>and know how much I still love her.</i>

01:07:46.439 --> 01:07:49.775
<i>In spite of everything, I still want Paul
to win the election tomorrow,</i>

01:07:49.859 --> 01:07:51.902
<i>not that cunt Tracy.</i>

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:55.489
<i>Oh, and I also want a really expensive
pair of leather pants,</i>

01:07:55.573 --> 01:07:58.743
<i>and someday I want to be
really good friends with Madonna.</i>

01:07:58.826 --> 01:08:00.661
<i>Love, Tammy.</i>

01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:04.165
<i>Dear God, thank you for all your blessings.</i>

01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:08.002
<i>You've given me so many things,
like good health, nice parents,</i>

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:11.005
<i>a nice truck,
and what I'm told is a large penis,</i>

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:13.007
<i>and I'm very grateful.</i>

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.468
<i>But I sure am worried about Tammy.</i>

01:08:15.551 --> 01:08:18.511
<i>In my heart, I still can't believe
she tore down my posters,</i>

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.849
<i>but sometimes she does get
so weird and angry.</i>

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:25.394
<i>Please help her be a happier person
because she's so smart and sensitive</i>

01:08:25.478 --> 01:08:27.813
<i>and I love her so much.</i>

01:08:27.897 --> 01:08:31.442
<i>Also, I'm nervous about the election tomorrow,</i>

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:35.488
<i>and I guess I want to win and all,
but I know that's totally up to you.</i>

01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:38.866
<i>You'll decide who the best person is
and I'll accept it,</i>

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.453
<i>and forgive me for my sins,
whatever they may be.</i>

01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:44.037
<i>Amen.</i>

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:52.921
<i>Linda never came home that night.</i>

01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:57.635
<i>I know, because I spent 10 hours
waiting outside her house.</i>

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:05.392
Oh. Oh.

01:09:12.733 --> 01:09:14.276
Oh, God.

01:09:46.517 --> 01:09:49.435
<i>On election day,
my mom and I got up really early,</i>

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.606
<i>and together we customized 480 cupcakes.</i>

01:09:59.405 --> 01:10:01.407
Good morning, Mr. M.

01:10:05.286 --> 01:10:07.621
Looks like you could use a cupcake.

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:17.089
Hey, what happened to your eye?

01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:24.096
Are you okay?

01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:27.975
"Mr. McAllister, Mr. McAllister,
somebody tore down my posters.

01:10:28.058 --> 01:10:30.686
It's not fair. It's not fair.

01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:33.647
Can I have an 'A'?
Can I have a recommendation?

01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:35.941
Can I, can I?"

01:10:36.025 --> 01:10:37.943
Fuck them.

01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:00.716
<i>Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.</i>

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:02.839
<i>We're not around,
but we'll call you back real soon.</i>

01:11:02.885 --> 01:11:04.929
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

01:11:05.012 --> 01:11:06.889
Why did you do that?

01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:08.933
I trusted you completely.

01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:12.102
And you ruined my life.
Do you know that? Do you realize that?

01:11:12.186 --> 01:11:14.355
Huh? Do you?

01:11:14.438 --> 01:11:16.273
You ruined Diane's life.
You ruined my life.

01:11:16.357 --> 01:11:18.400
Is that what you wanted?

01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:21.654
I'm — I'm sorry. I-I'm — I'm sorry.

01:11:21.737 --> 01:11:26.075
I'm just — I'm going nuts here,
and I really think we should talk.

01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:30.079
It's Jim. I love you.

01:11:37.211 --> 01:11:38.754
Attention, everyone.

01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:42.466
We have an important announcement
from our principal, Dr. Hendricks.

01:11:46.178 --> 01:11:48.514
Good morning, students.

01:11:48.597 --> 01:11:53.018
It, uh, behooves me to inform you
of an important change in today's election.

01:11:53.102 --> 01:11:56.522
Effective this morning,
sophomore Tammy Meltzler has been —

01:11:56.605 --> 01:12:01.652
<i>Metzler has been determined ineligible,
I repeat, ineligible for SGA president.</i>

01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:03.612
<i>All other candidates are eligible.</i>

01:12:03.696 --> 01:12:08.158
<i>You may, uh, vote for any of those,
but not Tammy Metzler.</i>

01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:12.538
<i>When the time came to cast our votes,</i>

01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:14.832
<i>I stood in line just like everyone else.</i>

01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:17.501
- Hi, Tracy.
- Tracy Enid Flick.

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.795
I know.

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:21.380
Thank you.

01:12:33.559 --> 01:12:35.936
- Ready, Phil?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

01:12:44.486 --> 01:12:45.988
Thanks, Phil.

01:12:49.867 --> 01:12:52.077
Oh, hey, Tracy.

01:12:52.161 --> 01:12:54.580
- Hi, Paul.
- Isn't this exciting?

01:12:55.414 --> 01:12:56.707
Mm-hmm.

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:58.834
Well, good luck.

01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:01.170
Thanks, Paul. You too.

01:13:01.253 --> 01:13:03.088
Oh, thanks!

01:13:10.054 --> 01:13:11.638
<i>It's so weird.</i>

01:13:11.722 --> 01:13:13.849
<i>Do people always just vote for themselves?</i>

01:13:13.932 --> 01:13:17.478
<i>'Cause looking at my own name
on the ballot, I just —</i>

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:22.608
<i>I don't know. I just felt like
it's not right to vote for yourself.</i>

01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:43.212
Okay, Mr. M.

01:13:44.129 --> 01:13:48.300
Oh, right. So... let's start counting.

01:13:48.383 --> 01:13:52.513
Okay. Well, as the election committee
chairman, I'll do the first count.

01:13:52.596 --> 01:13:56.225
And then you can do the second count,
you know, for the two independent counts.

01:13:56.308 --> 01:13:58.477
Fine. So do your count.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.854
Start with the president,
and I'll be right back.

01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:04.650
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

01:14:07.945 --> 01:14:09.530
Right.

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:24.920
Are you okay, Mr. McAllister?

01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:27.005
Yeah. What happened to your eye?

01:14:27.089 --> 01:14:29.758
I'm fine! It's just a bee sting.

01:14:30.342 --> 01:14:32.469
A simple little everyday bee sting.

01:14:32.553 --> 01:14:35.639
Some people, they get stung,
it's no big deal.

01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:37.391
Me, I swell up.

01:14:38.267 --> 01:14:40.644
There's not much time left
until eighth period.

01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:42.729
I have other things going on too,
you know.

01:14:42.813 --> 01:14:45.732
Yeah. Okay.

01:14:45.816 --> 01:14:48.068
- We know.
- All right.

01:14:48.152 --> 01:14:49.653
I'll be right back.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.242
<i>Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.</i>

01:14:55.325 --> 01:14:57.369
<i>We're not around,
but we'll call you back real soon.</i>

01:14:57.452 --> 01:14:59.496
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.498
Uh, it's me again.

01:15:01.582 --> 01:15:04.626
I'm sorry for all the messages, but, uh —

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:07.296
Linda, if I could just hear your voice.

01:15:07.379 --> 01:15:09.214
If you'd only acknowledge that I —

01:15:09.298 --> 01:15:11.175
<i>What do you want, Jim?</i>

01:15:11.258 --> 01:15:13.135
You're there.

01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:15.179
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

01:15:15.262 --> 01:15:17.347
Linda, I love you.

01:15:17.431 --> 01:15:20.350
<i>Don't say that. You know it's not true.</i>

01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:23.061
It's the only true thing I know anymore.

01:15:23.145 --> 01:15:25.731
<i>We made a mistake.
Let's not make it worse.</i>

01:15:25.814 --> 01:15:28.692
A mistake? That was no mistake.

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:31.445
<i>I was lonely. You took advantage.</i>

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.113
Me?

01:15:33.197 --> 01:15:35.532
I took advantage of you?

01:15:35.616 --> 01:15:38.285
You hugged me! You kissed me!
You're the one who —

01:15:45.584 --> 01:15:48.295
- Hey, Mr. M. Big day, huh?
- Not now, Paul.

01:15:53.884 --> 01:15:55.302
What have you got?

01:15:56.261 --> 01:15:59.848
Well, I'm not supposed to tell.
Not until you've counted too.

01:15:59.932 --> 01:16:02.476
We're each supposed
to make an independent count.

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:04.186
You're kidding, right?

01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:06.355
Well, I thought those were the rules,
Mr. McAllister.

01:16:06.438 --> 01:16:08.315
If they've changed in any way, I can —

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:11.985
Larry, we're not electing the fucking pope here.
Just tell me who won.

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:19.826
It's a squeaker, Mr. M.

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:22.079
I've got Tracy by a vote.

01:16:22.162 --> 01:16:23.664
Just one vote.

01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:33.215
Mr. M?

01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:37.344
Ah.

01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:39.429
Okay.

01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:43.934
Well, guess I better do my count.

01:17:56.006 --> 01:17:58.759
<i>I was at the end of my count
when it happened.</i>

01:17:58.842 --> 01:18:01.887
<i>I'd come up with exactly
the same numbers as Larry —</i>

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:04.890
<i>256 to 257.</i>

01:18:04.973 --> 01:18:07.893
<i>Tracy had won the election
by a single vote.</i>

01:18:10.812 --> 01:18:13.106
<i>I was about to announce my tally when...</i>

01:18:22.532 --> 01:18:26.995
<i>The sight of Tracy at that moment
affected me in a way I can't fully explain.</i>

01:18:28.372 --> 01:18:30.290
<i>Part of it was that she was spying.</i>

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:33.210
<i>But mostly it was her face.</i>

01:18:37.923 --> 01:18:40.550
<i>Who knew how high she would climb in life?</i>

01:18:40.634 --> 01:18:43.345
<i>How many people would suffer
because of her?</i>

01:18:44.346 --> 01:18:47.557
<i>I had to stop her... now.</i>

01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:21.425
Larry?

01:19:22.551 --> 01:19:23.552
Yeah?

01:19:24.136 --> 01:19:25.971
I think we have a problem.

01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:29.474
253, 254, and 255.

01:19:29.558 --> 01:19:31.560
Yep, I get the same as you, Jim.

01:19:31.643 --> 01:19:33.437
Looks like Paul's our next president.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.273
No way! I-It doesn't make sense.

01:19:36.356 --> 01:19:40.152
Well, sorry, Larry, but my figures work out
exactly the same as Mr. McAllister's.

01:19:40.235 --> 01:19:42.821
I get, uh, 256 for Paul,

01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:44.906
255 for Tracy.

01:19:45.907 --> 01:19:48.994
- And 290 disregards, right?
- If you say so.

01:19:49.077 --> 01:19:52.664
- Mostly Tammy fans, if you can believe it.
- See? It doesn't add up.

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:56.126
There were 801 ballots,
but 803 people voted.

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:58.628
Well, there must be two votes missing.
Check the register.

01:19:58.712 --> 01:20:01.131
He's right. Two people must have
pocketed their ballots.

01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:02.507
Usually there's more.

01:20:02.591 --> 01:20:07.137
But they were there. I counted 803 votes.

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:08.889
It happens, Larry.
People make mistakes.

01:20:08.972 --> 01:20:10.474
I didn't make a mistake.

01:20:11.183 --> 01:20:14.144
- Every vote was there when you sat down.
- Easy, Fouch.

01:20:14.227 --> 01:20:16.188
I don't like where you're going.

01:20:16.271 --> 01:20:19.107
I'm sorry, Dr. Hendricks,
but every vote was accounted for.

01:20:19.191 --> 01:20:20.901
Fouch, that's enough.

01:20:20.984 --> 01:20:22.986
End of story.

01:20:43.924 --> 01:20:45.217
Paul?

01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:50.013
I just want to let you know that no matter
what happens and how this turns out,

01:20:50.096 --> 01:20:52.432
you've run a really great campaign.

01:20:52.516 --> 01:20:54.976
- Good luck.
- Well, thanks, Tracy.

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:58.396
You too. I'm just glad it's over.

01:21:00.023 --> 01:21:01.733
If we can just get started.

01:21:01.816 --> 01:21:04.444
People. People.

01:21:04.528 --> 01:21:07.906
As soon as the winners are announced,
we can all go home, okay?

01:21:09.157 --> 01:21:12.494
Some contests are... are so well-fought

01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:15.413
that it seems unfair for someone to win.

01:21:15.497 --> 01:21:19.125
<i>Act surprised.
Walk slowly to the podium.</i>

01:21:19.209 --> 01:21:22.629
<i>Be modest.
Thank them for this incredible honour.</i>

01:21:22.712 --> 01:21:25.090
They're all highly qualified

01:21:25.173 --> 01:21:28.510
and embody the, uh, integrity

01:21:28.593 --> 01:21:32.055
that we expect from the school leadership.

01:21:32.138 --> 01:21:35.517
That said, the whole point of an election
is to choose a winner,

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.435
and that you have done.

01:21:37.519 --> 01:21:39.104
We'll begin with president.

01:21:40.397 --> 01:21:44.192
I'd just like to add that this
was an extraordinarily close race.

01:21:45.485 --> 01:21:48.363
It is my pleasure to announce
the next president

01:21:48.446 --> 01:21:50.699
of George Washington Carver High School,

01:21:50.782 --> 01:21:52.909
Paul Metzler.

01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:08.300
Geez, you guys, thanks.

01:22:08.383 --> 01:22:10.010
Whoo!

01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:12.012
Wow! Thanks.

01:22:12.095 --> 01:22:14.264
I promise to do my best

01:22:14.347 --> 01:22:17.559
and do a really good job
and be a good president.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:23.565
I just want to thank, uh, Lisa Flanagan
for being a super campaign manager.

01:22:23.648 --> 01:22:25.859
And I'd also like to say...

01:23:05.649 --> 01:23:07.025
Look. It's Mr. M.

01:23:07.108 --> 01:23:10.153
Yes, over there. Yeah, come on.

01:23:10.236 --> 01:23:11.738
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:14.115 --> 01:23:16.368
Wow, Mr. M. This is so wild.

01:23:16.451 --> 01:23:19.331
We were just here, uh, you know,
celebrating my victory, and you're here.

01:23:19.371 --> 01:23:22.290
This is incredible. This is great.
Well, these are my parents.

01:23:22.374 --> 01:23:24.376
- Hi. Dick Metzler.
- Jim McAllister.

01:23:24.459 --> 01:23:25.960
- Jo Metzler.
- How do you do?

01:23:26.044 --> 01:23:28.481
Paul just thinks the world of you.
I mean, you should hear him.

01:23:28.505 --> 01:23:29.881
- He goes on and on and on.
- Yes.

01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:31.675
Apparently you've really come behind him,

01:23:31.758 --> 01:23:34.111
really helped him out
with that student council thing and all.

01:23:34.135 --> 01:23:36.429
Oh, well — well,
Paul doesn't need any help from me.

01:23:36.513 --> 01:23:38.848
He's going places.
You should be very proud.

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:41.351
- Oh, we are.
- Hey, look, you're all alone.

01:23:41.434 --> 01:23:43.853
- Why don't you come over and join us?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:43.937 --> 01:23:45.939
- Come on.
- No, I'm just finishing up here.

01:23:46.022 --> 01:23:48.233
- I've gotta get home.
- Okay.

01:23:48.316 --> 01:23:50.902
Oh, well, uh,
why don't you guys go sit down,

01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:53.530
and, uh... you know,
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

01:23:53.613 --> 01:23:56.700
I'm going to talk to Mr. M
about some important stuff, all right?

01:23:56.783 --> 01:23:59.369
All right. That sounds great.
Hey, sure nice to meet you.

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:01.079
- Great to meet you.
- Pleasure.

01:24:01.162 --> 01:24:03.164
- So nice, and thank you.
- You bet.

01:24:07.252 --> 01:24:09.546
So, Mr. M,
I was starting to think about, you know,

01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:11.631
some ideas for what we could do.

01:24:11.715 --> 01:24:13.842
I was thinking it'd be cool
to have a carnival.

01:24:13.925 --> 01:24:15.552
You know, with rides and stuff.

01:24:15.635 --> 01:24:17.762
And it could be for,
like, muscular dystrophy.

01:24:17.846 --> 01:24:21.224
And then on Halloween,
we could have a haunted house.

01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:24.686
But you know, a really good haunted house,
not like those cheesy bad ones.

01:24:24.769 --> 01:24:27.397
You know, I mean,
this one would be super scary.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.733
And then for homecoming, well,

01:24:29.816 --> 01:24:32.235
you know how last year's theme
was "Heaven On Earth"?

01:24:32.318 --> 01:24:34.028
- Well, this year —
- Paul.

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:38.032
We'll have plenty of time
to talk about this later.

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:40.076
A whole year, in fact.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.495
But right now, I'd just...

01:24:42.579 --> 01:24:46.958
I need to finish my pie, go on home.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:50.336
Yeah, okay. Sorry.

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:54.090
Uh, Mr. M, just one more thing.

01:24:54.174 --> 01:24:57.051
So, uh, do you think Tracy's
gonna be okay?

01:24:57.135 --> 01:24:59.679
I mean, I saw her face after the assembly.

01:24:59.763 --> 01:25:01.973
It looked like
she was taking it pretty hard.

01:25:03.475 --> 01:25:07.479
Don't worry about Tracy.
She'll be fine.

01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:21.117
Oh, sweetheart.

01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:23.995
Oh, sweetheart.

01:25:24.078 --> 01:25:25.622
Oh.

01:25:25.705 --> 01:25:28.583
Oh, baby. Baby.

01:25:28.666 --> 01:25:30.418
Oh, baby.

01:25:30.502 --> 01:25:32.712
Come on. Take one of my pills.

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:35.673
You'll feel better.

01:25:35.757 --> 01:25:37.717
Here.

01:25:37.801 --> 01:25:39.302
Oh.

01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:44.724
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:51.314

01:25:52.482 --> 01:25:54.943
Good girl.

01:25:55.026 --> 01:25:58.488
That's it. That's it, baby.

01:25:59.489 --> 01:26:01.574
That's it, honey.

01:26:06.746 --> 01:26:08.873
Maybe you needed more posters, honey.

01:26:10.625 --> 01:26:13.795
Or if you'd just taken my suggestions
about your speech.

01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:17.924
I don't know. We'll figure it out.

01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:32.188
Diane.

01:26:32.272 --> 01:26:35.483
I, uh — I made a mistake, and I...

01:26:43.533 --> 01:26:45.743
Did you want the same room?

01:26:47.745 --> 01:26:49.247

<i>It was very simple, really.</i>

01:29:42.545 --> 01:29:45.965
<i>I offered my resignation, and he accepted.</i>

01:29:47.175 --> 01:29:52.180
<i>Very quietly, it was all over

01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:58.352

01:30:02.648 --> 01:30:06.861
<i>Overnight, all the good things
I'd ever done in my life evaporated.</i>

01:30:08.196 --> 01:30:11.199
<i>Soon the wire services picked up
on the story.</i>

01:30:11.282 --> 01:30:14.619
<i>It was the kind of absurd little news item
people e-mail each other</i>

01:30:14.702 --> 01:30:17.538
<i>or post on the bulletin board at work.</i>

01:30:18.414 --> 01:30:22.001
<i>To top it all off,
Diane had started divorce proceedings.</i>

01:30:22.085 --> 01:30:25.588
<i>She was completely unforgiving
about the thing with Linda.</i>

01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:29.425
<i>In the end, she took almost everything,
including the house.</i>

01:30:29.509 --> 01:30:31.260
<i>I got the car.</i>

01:30:48.569 --> 01:30:53.574

01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:09.340
<i>but I got elected homecoming king

01:31:09.423 --> 01:31:12.635
<i>I got into Nebraska, like I wanted,

<i>And at the end of the year,

<i>Maybe my whole life would be different.</i>

01:31:39.495 --> 01:31:43.291

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.043
<i>"If you're gonna be great,
you've got to be lonely."</i>

01:34:36.505 --> 01:34:39.717
<i>What happens to a man
when he loses everything?</i>

01:34:41.427 --> 01:34:43.429
<i>Everything he's worked for.</i>

01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:46.474
<i>Everything he believes in.</i>

01:34:48.059 --> 01:34:49.560
<i>Driven from his home.</i>

01:34:49.643 --> 01:34:52.063
<i>Cast out of society.</i>

01:34:52.146 --> 01:34:54.690
<i>How can he survive?</i>

01:34:54.774 --> 01:34:56.859
<i>Where can he go?</i>

01:34:56.942 --> 01:34:58.652
Right this way.

01:34:58.736 --> 01:35:01.614
<i>New York City.</i>

01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:15.419
<i>For centuries, people have come to New York
seeking refuge from their troubled lives.</i>

01:35:17.463 --> 01:35:19.673
<i>Now I am one of them.</i>

01:35:20.591 --> 01:35:22.718
<i>Besides,
I'd always dreamed of living in New York.</i>

01:35:22.802 --> 01:35:24.970
<i>All that excitement and culture.</i>

01:35:25.054 --> 01:35:27.765
<i>Living in the city
brings surprises all the time.</i>

01:35:27.848 --> 01:35:32.311
<i>Once in a while, I even bump into
former students of mine from Carver.</i>

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:36.816
<i>Oh, sure, my apartment's a little smaller
than what I was used to back in Omaha,</i>

01:35:36.899 --> 01:35:38.818
<i>and the rent's pretty darn steep,</i>

01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:42.446
<i>but it's got a lot of character,
and I'm cozy enough.</i>

01:35:45.408 --> 01:35:47.368
<i>Besides, it's great not needing a car.</i>

01:35:48.035 --> 01:35:50.955
<i>And I get a lot of reading done
on the subway.</i>

01:35:51.038 --> 01:35:53.457
<i>Some days I even walk to work.</i>

01:35:55.793 --> 01:36:00.131
<i>The job market is pretty tight in New York,
but after hunting around for a while,</i>

01:36:00.214 --> 01:36:03.217
<i>I finally landed a position
in the education department</i>

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.678
<i>at the Museum of Natural History.</i>

01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:08.305
<i>That's right. I'm teaching again.</i>

01:36:08.389 --> 01:36:10.057
The bison, or buffalo —

01:36:10.141 --> 01:36:13.060
<i>When a school brings its students
to the museum on a field trip,</i>

01:36:13.144 --> 01:36:17.314
<i>there's a staff of both volunteer docents
and trained educators like myself</i>

01:36:17.398 --> 01:36:19.191
<i>who pick up
where the class work leaves off.</i>

01:36:19.275 --> 01:36:20.317
Down these tubes —

01:36:20.401 --> 01:36:22.862
<i>And I've started seeing someone new.</i>

01:36:22.945 --> 01:36:24.530
<i>Her name is Jillian.</i>

01:36:24.613 --> 01:36:27.575
<i>She works at the museum too,
in Signs and Signage.</i>

01:36:27.658 --> 01:36:30.244
<i>She's really different from Diane,
and, I don't know,</i>

01:36:30.327 --> 01:36:32.830
<i>I've just never met anyone quite like her.</i>

01:36:33.581 --> 01:36:35.583
<i>She just got out
of a long relationship too,</i>

01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:38.419
<i>so we're trying to take it slow.</i>

01:36:41.297 --> 01:36:44.175
<i>You might ask
if I ever saw Tracy Flick again.</i>

01:36:44.258 --> 01:36:46.886
<i>Well, I did. Just once.</i>

01:36:49.722 --> 01:36:53.058
<i>I was down in Washington
for a museum educators' conference,</i>

01:36:53.142 --> 01:36:55.728
<i>and I stayed an extra day
to do some sightseeing.</i>

01:36:59.023 --> 01:37:01.358
<i>After an inspiring morning on the Mall,</i>

01:37:01.442 --> 01:37:04.945
<i>I was on my way
to the Holocaust Museum when...</i>

01:37:40.356 --> 01:37:42.441
<i>I'll never know if she saw me.</i>

01:37:42.525 --> 01:37:44.026
<i>Probably not.</i>

01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:46.737
<i>But in that moment, all the bad memories,</i>

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.281
<i>all the things
I'd ever wanted to say to her,</i>

01:37:49.365 --> 01:37:51.784
<i>it all came flooding back.</i>

01:37:54.912 --> 01:37:58.165
<i>My first impulse was to run over there,
pound on her window,</i>

01:37:58.249 --> 01:38:00.960
<i>and demand that she admit
she tore down those posters</i>

01:38:01.043 --> 01:38:03.879
<i>and lied and cheated her way
into winning that election.</i>

01:38:05.005 --> 01:38:08.175
<i>But instead, I just stood there.</i>

01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:13.806
<i>And I suddenly realized
I wasn't angry at her anymore.</i>

01:38:14.807 --> 01:38:17.101
<i>I just felt sorry for her.</i>

01:38:17.184 --> 01:38:21.647
<i>I mean, when I think about my new life
and all the exciting things I'm doing,</i>

01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:24.233
<i>and then I think about
what her life must be like —</i>

01:38:24.942 --> 01:38:27.069
<i>probably still getting up
at 5:00 in the morning</i>

01:38:27.152 --> 01:38:29.863
<i>to pursue her pathetic little dreams —</i>

01:38:29.947 --> 01:38:32.074
<i>it just makes me sad.</i>

01:38:32.825 --> 01:38:36.370
<i>I mean, where is she really trying
to get to anyway?</i>

01:38:36.453 --> 01:38:39.039
<i>And what is she doing in that limo?</i>

01:38:39.123 --> 01:38:41.875
<i>Who the fuck does she think she is?</i>

01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:53.178
Hey, you! Hey!

01:38:54.471 --> 01:38:55.973
You asshole!

01:38:56.807 --> 01:38:58.934
<i>But that's all ancient history now.</i>

01:38:59.018 --> 01:39:01.145
<i>I've got a whole new life.</i>

01:39:01.228 --> 01:39:03.647
<i>I mean, that's what's great about America.</i>

01:39:03.731 --> 01:39:05.608
<i>You can always start over.</i>

01:39:05.691 --> 01:39:09.653
So would that make this an igneous rock
or a sedimentary rock?

01:39:09.737 --> 01:39:13.073
What's the difference between igneous
and sedimentary anyway?

01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:24.752
