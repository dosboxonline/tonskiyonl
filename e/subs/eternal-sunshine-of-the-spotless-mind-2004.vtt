<i>the last night we were together.</i>

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:12.080
<i>It wasn't sex.</i>
<i>It was just sad.</i>

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.080
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.680
<i>The only way Clem thinks</i>
<i>she can get people to like her...</i>

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.480
<i>is to fuck 'em...</i>

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:25.600
<i>or at least dangle the possibility</i>
<i>of getting fucked in front of'em.</i>

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.480
<i>And she's so desperate</i>
<i>and insecure...</i>

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:33.160
<i>that she'll, sooner or later,</i>
<i>go around fucking everybody.</i>

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.120
I don't do that.
<i>I wouldn't think that</i>
<i>about you.</i>

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:39.000
- Because I don't.
- I know.

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.160
<i>Because it really hurts me</i>
<i>that you said that</i>
<i>because I don't do that.</i>

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.200
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.880
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.360
Um... bye.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.960
Bye.
<i>[ On Tape ]</i>
<i>I thought I knew her so well.</i>

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.480
It was nice meeting you and all.
<i>But I don't know her at all.</i>

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.960
<i>What a loss to spend</i>
<i>that much time with someone,</i>

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.760
<i>only to find out</i>
<i>that she's a stranger.</i>

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.840
Wait.

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.320
What?
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.440
Just wait.Just wait.
<i>What do you want,Joel?</i>

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.840
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.760
[ Quiet Sob ]

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.440
<i>Okay.</i>
Really?

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.480
<i>I'm not a concept,Joel.</i>
<i>I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking</i>
<i>for my own peace of mind.</i>

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.320
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.960
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.520
You know, you will think of things,
and I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped...

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.560
because that's what happens
with me.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.840
Okay.

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:07.320
