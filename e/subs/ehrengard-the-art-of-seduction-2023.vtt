EHRENGARD
THE ART OF SEDUCTION

01:54.625 --> 01:56.416
Please sit still, Your Grace.

02:00.916 --> 02:04.000
I can't believe
that you don't need to rest a bit.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.541
Did you straighten your dress again?

02:07.708 --> 02:09.375
If so, it was not intended.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.208
Please sit still.

02:47.708 --> 02:48.833
Is something wrong?

02:51.833 --> 02:55.500
My husband would have you beheaded,
if he saw you.

02:55.583 --> 03:00.208
I got the impression that the Grand Duke
wanted me to… capture your beauty.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.416
In that case, one can't be petty.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.041
There.

03:19.916 --> 03:20.875
Second thoughts?

03:21.875 --> 03:26.541
I'm afraid I rather value my head's
position on my body, Your Grace.

03:32.125 --> 03:35.166
I… I must ask you
to please sit up straight.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.625
This is taking an eternity.

03:51.125 --> 03:52.000
Indeed.

03:53.416 --> 03:55.041
A true portrait takes time.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.416
Yes, so I've noticed.

04:00.458 --> 04:01.458
Like a seduction.

04:06.708 --> 04:07.541
Mr. Cazotte.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.000
Miss Zimmermann.

04:46.833 --> 04:47.666
Mr. Cazotte!

04:49.125 --> 04:54.208
-Rent is overdue. If you don't pay…
-My dear Madam.

04:54.291 --> 04:58.458
Didn't I offer to sketch your portrait?
If you knew the value…

04:58.541 --> 05:01.958
I don't want a drawing of myself.
I want money.

05:02.041 --> 05:05.083
And it's on its way.
Trust me. It's coming.

05:05.166 --> 05:08.208
Smile. It's a wonderful day. All is well.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.541
Your Graces,
I am very honoured by the invitation.

05:31.625 --> 05:33.500
Thank you for having me.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.083
I am delighted. Most delighted.

05:49.958 --> 05:50.833
Thank you.

05:57.708 --> 06:03.750
Your Graces, I am overwhelmed
and honoured by the invitation. Thank you.

06:04.458 --> 06:05.333
The painter.

06:05.416 --> 06:08.583
I hope you are happy with the piece,
Your Grace.

06:08.666 --> 06:09.875
A painter?

06:27.708 --> 06:30.416
Beautiful, is it not?
It looks just like her.

06:35.791 --> 06:37.416
But then again, it doesn't.

06:38.125 --> 06:41.291
I know nothing about such things.
But if you say so.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.750
Interesting. You said,
"But then again, it doesn't."

06:48.041 --> 06:51.583
I believe that art
should be more than just lifelike.

06:51.666 --> 06:54.958
Like a poem that one
can't always make sense of, but…

06:55.041 --> 06:58.791
-What are you talking about?
-Apologies. My name is Cazotte.

06:58.875 --> 07:03.458
I painted this portrait. Artist, painter,
man, etcetera. And you are?

07:06.250 --> 07:07.541
I beg your pardon.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.083
My daughter.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.375
-Your daughter?
-Yes.

07:46.708 --> 07:47.541
Mr. Cazotte.

07:48.458 --> 07:51.041
You look glum.
Aren't you enjoying yourself?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.583
Very much so, Your Grace.

07:55.916 --> 07:58.583
Please tell me who you are gazing at.

08:00.708 --> 08:01.875
Am I gazing?

08:01.958 --> 08:04.083
Yes, you very clearly are.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.708
You can tell me anything.

08:08.791 --> 08:10.916
I am not jealous. On the contrary.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.875
I delight in hearing about the passions
of others. In detail, please.

08:15.958 --> 08:20.500
Actually, I did see a… young lady.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.500
-Where?
-There.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.833
Indeed, Ehrengard.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.458
-Ehrengard.
-Yes, she is lovely.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.791
Her father was my
father-in-law's aide-de-camp.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.875
-A rather stern family.
-So I gathered, yes.

08:38.125 --> 08:41.958
Did she like the portrait?
Was she spellbound by your talents?

08:42.041 --> 08:44.250
No, you can't exactly say that.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.541
Poor you.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.416
But don't look so discouraged.

08:48.541 --> 08:53.625
A young man recently told me
that it takes time, seduction.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.208
Like painting a portrait.

08:55.291 --> 08:58.750
Actually, that was my reason
for inviting you this evening.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.375
A new portrait?

09:01.458 --> 09:05.541
No, your talent for seduction. Come.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.791
Do you remember my son?

09:15.583 --> 09:18.083
-A handsome young man, Your Grace.
-Indeed.

09:19.416 --> 09:20.791
We need your help.

09:20.875 --> 09:21.708
-You do?
-Yes.

09:22.375 --> 09:25.333
-Do you know the Act of Succession?
-I don't.

09:25.416 --> 09:31.083
I thought as much. We are not firmly
seated on the throne, so to speak.

09:32.625 --> 09:35.916
You do recall
that the former Grand Duke was childless.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.333
-I don't, really…
-Just listen.

09:38.416 --> 09:41.125
He was. And my husband
isn't a direct descendant.

09:41.833 --> 09:45.791
It came to a feud over the throne
between the various cousins,

09:45.875 --> 09:49.791
which my husband won in the end.
There you see one of his cousins.

09:49.875 --> 09:53.666
Count Marbod. And Countess Orsyla.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.000
Bah!

09:55.625 --> 09:57.458
They're watching us like hawks.

09:58.125 --> 10:01.791
Our problem is
that the Grand Duke is gravely ill.

10:01.875 --> 10:05.416
-The doctors can't help him.
-I am sorry to hear, Your Grace.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.958
Yes, it's heartbreaking.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.541
My son stands to inherit the throne,

10:11.625 --> 10:14.500
but he isn't married,
so he can't inherit it.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.166
Maybe under different circumstances, but…

10:17.250 --> 10:20.166
-You aren't firmly seated on the throne.
-Exactly.

10:22.916 --> 10:25.000
And how am I to help, Your Grace?

10:25.583 --> 10:26.541
Look at my son.

10:27.458 --> 10:32.583
Look at the young Prince,
and the ladies around him. They flock.

10:33.791 --> 10:35.666
But he barely looks their way.

10:36.791 --> 10:38.000
Not even a smile.

10:38.833 --> 10:43.208
A love life, eroticism.
It is of no interest to him.

10:43.291 --> 10:46.666
-I see what you mean, Your Grace, but…
-But what?

10:47.750 --> 10:50.250
Noble fruit is slow to ripen.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.750
I already told you, we have no time.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.083
Prince Lothar must find a wife soon,

10:56.166 --> 10:58.625
or else the throne will be given to…

11:00.458 --> 11:01.958
my husband's cousin.

11:02.458 --> 11:05.708
It's all very confusing,
but those are the rules.

11:05.791 --> 11:09.833
-Just to… Yes.
-You, Mr. Cazotte. Your task…

11:11.833 --> 11:13.916
You are to arouse my son's passion.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.291
His belle passion.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.208
-I am?
-I cannot think of anyone more suited.

11:25.958 --> 11:28.625
-I don't know if I am.
-Of course you are.

11:29.958 --> 11:31.208
Name your price.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.875
It's not a matter of money, Your Grace.

11:35.958 --> 11:39.416
But I must insist
you are rewarded for your efforts.

11:42.875 --> 11:43.708
Anything.

11:44.416 --> 11:45.750
Use your imagination.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.458
-Ehrengard.
-Ehrengard?

11:54.541 --> 11:59.250
I'd like to paint a portrait of her.
Perhaps you could arrange that.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.208
Very well.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.375
I'll do my best.

12:05.708 --> 12:10.458
-But you must tell me all the details.
-Naturally, Your Grace.

12:46.916 --> 12:48.250
Keep the change.

12:49.250 --> 12:53.291
Someone from the court will
pick up the remainder of my belongings.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.208
Excuse me, my Lord.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.500
My name is Cazotte. I am an artist.

13:12.583 --> 13:16.333
I know your mother and I was just
taking a walk in the garden.

13:16.416 --> 13:18.125
I mean you no harm, my Lord.

13:18.708 --> 13:21.958
But when I saw you standing here,
it seemed to me…

13:23.500 --> 13:26.708
Forgive me, but you looked
a little sad standing here.

13:32.833 --> 13:34.875
-They want me to marry.
-Who?

13:34.958 --> 13:36.250
My mother and father.

13:36.875 --> 13:37.916
-Everyone.
-Oh my.

13:39.541 --> 13:41.083
And… you don't want to?

13:42.375 --> 13:43.208
No.

13:44.875 --> 13:47.750
Because you want your freedom. Of course.

13:50.375 --> 13:54.750
What if I told you, my Lord, that you,

13:54.833 --> 13:58.958
with all due respect, of course…
have misunderstood something?

13:59.791 --> 14:04.833
What you see… as a prison…

14:04.916 --> 14:07.791
is actually a liberation.

14:07.875 --> 14:11.041
Allow me to show you
some sketches, my Lord.

14:11.666 --> 14:13.000
Love life.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.541
Yes. Yes, that one is good.

14:21.416 --> 14:22.375
See the poetry?

14:25.750 --> 14:29.083
-You like that one. It's yours. Keep it.
-Yes.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.833
I managed to gain the Prince's trust.

14:33.666 --> 14:37.625
Your Grace, my honour forbids me
from revealing in detail

14:37.708 --> 14:40.375
what I told him
during those days and nights.

14:41.083 --> 14:45.458
Suffice to say that I piqued his
imagination to the best of my ability.

14:45.541 --> 14:50.125
I remember reciting passages from both
"Decameron" and "The Canterbury Tales",

14:50.208 --> 14:53.541
about the miller and the woman from Bath.

14:53.625 --> 14:56.833
About the marvellous beauty
which can be found,

14:56.916 --> 15:03.083
about silky rose petals,
swelling hearts intoxicated with blood,

15:03.166 --> 15:06.625
and about lighting
a third candle with one's torch.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.000
I proposed he go on a trip.

15:09.875 --> 15:10.708
A trip?

15:11.583 --> 15:13.416
To the castle in Leuchenstein.

15:14.375 --> 15:18.125
I'm painting a family portrait there.
I'd like to bring the Prince,

15:18.208 --> 15:22.458
introduce him to the daughters.
Not without your permission, of course.

15:22.541 --> 15:28.291
But we already tried with Leuchenstein.
They're horrid. Utterly devoid of charm.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.333
Not the youngest.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.083
-Ludmilla.
-But she's just a child.

15:33.750 --> 15:37.083
Time flies, Your Grace.
She turns 18 next week.

15:37.791 --> 15:38.625
Indeed?

15:39.708 --> 15:41.291
You know the family well?

15:41.791 --> 15:44.708
I painted their portraits,
a long time ago, yes.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.083
You only painted portraits?

15:47.791 --> 15:50.166
Your Grace, what do you think of me?

15:53.208 --> 15:56.416
Perhaps you ought not
set your expectations too high.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.166
I have no expectations. But I do hope.

16:05.666 --> 16:09.458
My Lord, I was thinking
that perhaps you could wear this.

16:10.791 --> 16:12.375
And dress like a peasant?

16:12.458 --> 16:16.750
No. As my apprentice. But yes, anonymity.

16:17.541 --> 16:21.625
You can weigh up Ludmilla
without the burden of your title.

16:21.708 --> 16:25.208
What is she like? She is like the rose

16:25.291 --> 16:30.375
whose rich fragrance innocently

16:30.458 --> 16:34.625
lures the passer-by to pick the flower.

16:35.708 --> 16:37.416
But no one has picked it yet.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.041
Close your eyes and picture the most
beautiful woman you can.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.375
Her hand so firm and white.

16:49.625 --> 16:50.458
The hips.

16:51.333 --> 16:52.500
The knees.

16:52.583 --> 16:53.416
The ankles.

16:55.041 --> 17:00.416
Her velvet voice and her soft breath.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.666
Are you ready, my Lord?

17:09.750 --> 17:11.208
Good. Let's proceed.

17:16.875 --> 17:19.375
Now, Your Graces,
I think that will be all.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.958
We must however make one minor adjustment.

17:25.416 --> 17:29.000
Princess Ludmilla,
you have bloomed with such speed.

17:29.583 --> 17:33.958
In just two months since I was last here,
you are utterly transformed.

17:34.041 --> 17:38.708
So if I could ask you to stay here
for a short while, alone,

17:38.791 --> 17:40.708
I'd like to make some additions.

17:40.791 --> 17:42.375
Mama, Papa, may I?

17:58.541 --> 18:02.500
I am afraid I will have to ask you
to leave the room, Your Graces.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.916
If I am to capture her unique beauty,

18:07.000 --> 18:12.541
a certain detachment from her role
as the youngest is required, I'm afraid.

18:14.625 --> 18:15.458
Come.

18:20.958 --> 18:24.041
-We need the easel moved closer.
-Yes, sir.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.083
Now, let's see.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.333
-I'm blushing.
-Don't.

18:29.416 --> 18:32.250
-Please don't paint my face red.
-I won't.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.875
We'll go easy on the red.

18:33.958 --> 18:36.666
Please lift your chin up a little.
That's it.

18:37.166 --> 18:40.416
I must tell you, my Lady,
of my great fortune.

18:41.166 --> 18:44.333
Never have I had such
a talented assistant as…

18:45.083 --> 18:50.083
He has an artistic spirit
unlike any I have ever seen before.

18:52.875 --> 18:53.875
And pardon me…

18:54.916 --> 18:56.916
Isn't he handsome?

18:59.041 --> 19:01.666
-Yes, he is very handsome.
-So handsome.

19:02.166 --> 19:06.916
So handsome and with such a gifted soul.
He finds beauty where no one else does.

19:07.916 --> 19:09.083
That's talent.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.208
The very essence of talent.

19:11.750 --> 19:15.750
It is so wonderful. In fact,
it was his idea to refine your portrait.

19:17.875 --> 19:18.958
-Mm-mm.
-Yes.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.333
-Mm-mm. No.
-Yes.

19:20.416 --> 19:22.458
"You're not doing her justice."

19:23.166 --> 19:26.541
-"She hides even greater beauty."
-He didn't say that.

19:26.625 --> 19:27.833
-Truly?
-Yes.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.708
And I had to agree.

19:29.791 --> 19:30.708
-No.
-Yes.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.333
But it's a shame.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.833
It's such a shame that he is so shy.

19:46.083 --> 19:49.916
But it's a characteristic
of most great artists, is it not?

19:52.750 --> 19:55.458
-I don't know.
-It is. I can assure you it is.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.708
-Where is he from?
-Where he is from?

19:59.791 --> 20:01.333
He's of noble lineage.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.208
Like yourself.

20:12.583 --> 20:16.000
It is time to reveal
your true identify, Your Highness.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.166
-Me?
-No, no. Well.

20:28.416 --> 20:31.458
Please see to it
that the Princess is not disturbed.

21:13.458 --> 21:16.791
And they disappeared
like two playful puppies.

21:22.458 --> 21:23.375
No!

21:26.291 --> 21:27.125
Come.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.166
They walked the castle garden.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.750
You are a genius, Mr. Cazotte.

21:38.833 --> 21:43.500
Your son had the longing inside him
all along. I merely stoked it.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.041
You have done our lineage a great service.

21:47.125 --> 21:50.125
It has been my true pleasure.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.833
-Please know that.
-Yes.

21:59.125 --> 21:59.958
Indeed.

22:02.333 --> 22:05.333
-What's that?
-I'm afraid I have to disappoint you.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.750
-Disappoint?
-I spoke to General Schreckenstein.

22:08.833 --> 22:12.875
It is out of the question
that you paint a portrait of his daughter.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.833
Count yourself lucky I didn't mention
your name. He was rather incensed.

22:20.708 --> 22:21.541
I see.

22:27.583 --> 22:31.166
-Oh my, are you…
-No. Not at all, Your Grace. Not at all.

22:32.500 --> 22:36.083
It's been my pleasure to help,
but you don't need to pay me.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.333
-But the wedding.
-Yes.

22:38.416 --> 22:42.041
My son's wedding. You have to accept
the invitation. I insist.

22:44.208 --> 22:48.250
Accept these blessed
and consecrated rings.

22:48.333 --> 22:53.375
Exchange them, and let them forever
be a symbol of the unbreakable pact

22:53.458 --> 22:55.958
that you two have made
to each other today.

22:56.625 --> 23:01.041
Ludmilla, in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,

23:01.125 --> 23:03.541
I take you to be my lawfully wedded wife.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.375
Lothar, in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,

23:11.458 --> 23:13.583
I take you to be
my lawfully wedded husband.

23:20.375 --> 23:23.000
The union that you have now entered into,

23:23.083 --> 23:29.791
I legally authorise in the name of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

23:30.375 --> 23:31.208
Amen.

23:31.958 --> 23:34.166
Everyone gathered here today

23:34.250 --> 23:38.416
shall bear witness to the validity
of this unbreakable holy pact.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.458
What God has joined,
let no man tear asunder.

23:44.458 --> 23:47.666
Confirma hoc deus
quod operatus es in nobis.

23:49.000 --> 23:49.833
Amen.

24:08.208 --> 24:09.500
And… halt!

24:15.458 --> 24:18.166
Mr. Cazotte. Pack your things
and come with us.

24:33.208 --> 24:34.250
Your Grace.

24:35.666 --> 24:36.791
Oh, there you are.

24:36.875 --> 24:37.791
You seem upset.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.375
An heir is on the way.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.750
-Congratulations.
-No, not at all.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.583
-Not at all?
-No.

24:50.666 --> 24:53.583
The heir is due late May.

24:55.416 --> 24:56.291
-Yes?
-Yes.

24:57.250 --> 25:00.250
-That is in four months.
-Yes, I suppose so, yes.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.625
Four months, not nine.

25:07.916 --> 25:08.833
You laugh?

25:09.541 --> 25:12.958
-Don't you see it's a scandal?
-Yes, Your Grace. Apologies.

25:14.375 --> 25:17.875
God. God, the Lord, who is a great artist,

25:17.958 --> 25:21.416
at times paints His pictures
to be appreciated from afar.

25:21.958 --> 25:27.041
In 150 years, the predicament you now face
will seem like a pure idyll,

25:27.125 --> 25:30.625
composed for the joy of spectators.
Now, you're too close…

25:30.708 --> 25:32.083
Spare me this nonsense.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.583
Sorry. I'm trying to say

25:33.666 --> 25:38.250
that not one of your loyal subjects
would fail to smile in his heart

25:38.333 --> 25:43.166
upon hearing of the matter that vexes you.
For everyone loves a pair of lovers.

25:43.250 --> 25:48.250
I already told you how difficult it's been
to keep Babenhausen on our hands.

25:49.083 --> 25:51.166
-Oh, because of cousin…
-Marbod.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.416
Promiscuity may be acceptable
in your circles,

25:54.500 --> 25:56.583
but in ours, it's a death sentence.

25:57.458 --> 26:00.125
Prince Lothar will be disinherited
if it's revealed

26:00.208 --> 26:03.000
that the child
was conceived out of wedlock.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.000
-What will you do?
-No idea.

26:20.625 --> 26:25.125
Your son and his wife
must be spirited away to a place.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.625
Out of the public eye.

26:28.375 --> 26:29.208
In hiding?

26:29.875 --> 26:31.875
Yes. That should be possible.

26:31.958 --> 26:35.416
-Yes, but why?
-To keep the people in the dark.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.500
In the dark?

26:36.583 --> 26:40.583
Yes, I've explained to you
how seduction can be a type of vocation.

26:40.666 --> 26:41.625
Yes.

26:41.708 --> 26:45.375
It should be possible to seduce
the masses in the same manner.

26:46.458 --> 26:50.000
You talk a lot but say very little.
Are you aware of that?

26:50.541 --> 26:52.375
In a way, I feel responsible.

26:54.166 --> 26:58.541
You asked me to open your son's eyes
to the charms of the female sex.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.000
His eyes, nothing else.

27:00.541 --> 27:06.041
But, Your Grace…
providence has stepped in to help us.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.166
We mustn't fall out of step.

27:10.125 --> 27:13.166
I think I know a way to solve this.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.708
First you and his Grace
must notify the people.

27:19.375 --> 27:21.500
Esteemed citizens of Babenhausen.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.250
The date for the happy event should be
announced to fall sometime in…

27:26.333 --> 27:28.166
-…in the month of September.
-…September.

27:29.458 --> 27:34.708
You will announce that Princess Ludmilla,
at the court physician's advice,

27:34.791 --> 27:36.916
must keep to her bed for many months.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.125
-She must live in utmost tranquillity.
-…tranquillity.

27:40.208 --> 27:42.458
Utmost tranquillity? But where?

27:44.375 --> 27:49.000
Well, it will be up to me to find a place
as desolate and secluded as possible.

27:49.666 --> 27:51.291
Far away from the world.

27:51.375 --> 27:54.208
To arrange everything harmoniously.

27:54.291 --> 27:56.375
-You'll see to the decor too?
-Yes.

27:56.916 --> 28:00.541
It is essential
that no one see Princess Ludmilla

28:00.625 --> 28:03.416
until six months
after the child has been born.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.708
I will stay for the entire duration.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.125
To see that all goes to plan.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.250
-Are you able to do this?
-Yes.

28:13.833 --> 28:16.208
-Oh.
-Oh, now you are less sure.

28:16.750 --> 28:20.500
No, Your Grace. It just dawned on me

28:20.583 --> 28:23.791
that the Princess will need
a special lady-in-waiting.

28:23.875 --> 28:26.750
Not one of the usual gossips
from this court,

28:26.833 --> 28:29.541
but someone carefully chosen.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.541
-Someone we can trust.
-Naturally.

28:32.625 --> 28:35.791
She must be of such birth,
education and appearance

28:36.625 --> 28:39.250
that it would justify her selection.

28:39.333 --> 28:41.291
-Don't you agree?
-Yes, of course.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.916
Furthermore, young and kind

28:46.583 --> 28:51.875
as, during her seclusion,
the Princess will want a companion

28:51.958 --> 28:54.208
of her own age and temperament.

28:56.791 --> 29:03.583
And where are we to find a pleasant
young girl of the highest society

29:03.666 --> 29:07.916
with the elevation of mind
and an unerring loyal heart…

29:08.000 --> 29:10.333
You're doing it again. You talk and talk.

29:10.416 --> 29:16.041
Pardon me. I just meant…
Do you know of such a woman, Your Grace?

29:17.416 --> 29:21.333
Does anyone spring to mind?

29:27.750 --> 29:29.833
-Ehrengard.
-My goodness. Of course.

29:31.833 --> 29:37.125
-Well, you are just awful, Mr. Cazotte.
-What do you mean, Your Grace?

29:38.041 --> 29:40.000
You intend to seduce her.

29:40.083 --> 29:40.958
No.

29:46.583 --> 29:47.500
You are right.

29:48.875 --> 29:49.750
It is true.

29:51.333 --> 29:56.958
I owe you the truth. As one of
the very few people I have met in my life

29:57.708 --> 30:00.416
who understands the artist. You do.

30:01.625 --> 30:05.041
Pardon me, but may I
introduce you to my thoughts?

30:07.458 --> 30:08.291
Indeed.

30:11.541 --> 30:12.375
I see her.

30:14.791 --> 30:15.625
I see her.

30:18.083 --> 30:22.000
A young woman in a white frock,
daughter of warriors,

30:22.083 --> 30:27.458
in whose world-view the arts,
the artist, have never existed.

30:28.750 --> 30:33.166
And this is precisely why,
like Michelangelo, I exclaim,

30:34.291 --> 30:39.916
"Within that block of marble,
my greatest triumph is hidden."

30:50.208 --> 30:54.000
Michelangelo, block of marble,
warrior in a white frock aside,

30:54.083 --> 30:58.666
the Schreckensteins are Lutherans.
A very stern race, as I already mentioned.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.625
Practically Puritans.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.333
All military people.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.625
You won't get near her.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.458
Maybe so.

31:08.041 --> 31:11.791
-This time you've aimed too high.
-That may very well be.

31:12.416 --> 31:13.541
But I do not doubt.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.666
Then a wager may be called for.

31:25.791 --> 31:26.958
A wager?

31:27.583 --> 31:29.541
Ehrengard won't surrender to you.

31:34.708 --> 31:35.708
And if I succeed?

31:37.166 --> 31:41.166
If you win Ehrengard, I will offer you
lifelong employment at court.

31:41.250 --> 31:45.458
Furthermore, I will offer you
an artist abode wherever you choose.

31:46.166 --> 31:49.791
Then you can go about there,
rambling to your heart's content.

31:51.583 --> 31:52.458
Against?

31:54.708 --> 31:56.791
That you paint my portrait again.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.166
And this time you will not reject me.

32:17.125 --> 32:17.958
Very well.

32:37.041 --> 32:40.625
The Grand Duke and I remember
your loyal service to his father.

32:40.708 --> 32:43.166
It was the highlight of my early career.

32:43.666 --> 32:47.416
The matter at hand…
you mustn't disclose to anyone.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.958
Not even the Grand Duke.

32:49.916 --> 32:56.000
But please tell me, how have you been
able to assess my daughter's qualities?

32:56.500 --> 33:02.291
In all honesty, Mr. General, the honour
befalls my confidant in this case.

33:02.375 --> 33:03.208
Mr. Cazotte.

33:04.750 --> 33:05.666
I saw…

33:08.375 --> 33:09.583
…that here was a…

33:11.583 --> 33:12.666
…young Valkyrie.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.583
Raised under
the strictest military virtues.

33:17.916 --> 33:20.458
The only maiden
in a long line of warriors.

33:20.541 --> 33:26.416
An almost incredibly suitable young,
white-hot angel

33:26.500 --> 33:30.708
with her flaming sword
to guard the young lovers' paradise.

33:33.875 --> 33:37.333
I get carried away.
I find Ehrengard's strength impressive.

33:37.833 --> 33:39.625
And I see where it came from.

33:40.416 --> 33:41.708
Stop this nonsense.

33:43.458 --> 33:44.541
Anyway.

33:45.041 --> 33:48.375
No Schreckenstein has ever
turned down their Duke.

33:48.458 --> 33:51.458
Our entire family
is extremely grateful to you.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.000
Ehrengard. Pack your things.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.625
Of course, Father.

33:59.375 --> 34:00.791
-Just one thing.
-Yes?

34:01.375 --> 34:02.750
May I bid Kurt farewell?

34:04.000 --> 34:04.958
Kurt?

34:05.750 --> 34:08.166
My fiancé, Your Grace.

34:08.250 --> 34:11.041
Of course you may
bid your fiancé farewell.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.916
Thank you once again, Ehrengard.

35:05.958 --> 35:08.083
It is my honour to serve my country.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.666
You are a good girl.
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Cazotte?

35:12.750 --> 35:14.208
-Yes. Absolutely.
-Yes.

35:14.875 --> 35:16.500
Sleep well, Ehrengard.

35:16.583 --> 35:18.250
Sleep well, Your Grace.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.291
Yes, sleep very well, Ehrengard.

35:21.333 --> 35:22.458
Bonne nuit.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.416
What a pompous charlatan.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.916
-I have found a remote place.
-Yes?

35:41.291 --> 35:42.125
Rosenbad.

35:44.250 --> 35:45.333
-Rosenbad?
-Yes.

35:46.958 --> 35:49.750
-It's been unoccupied for generations.
-Just so.

36:02.291 --> 36:03.125
Welcome.

36:04.583 --> 36:06.583
Our physician, Professor Putziger.

36:07.375 --> 36:11.041
He'll stay here to keep an eye
on the Princess' health.

36:12.875 --> 36:14.666
Our riding master, Mr. Podolski.

36:15.875 --> 36:20.208
And of course our eminent chief
lady-in-waiting, Countess Poggendorf.

36:21.208 --> 36:24.166
She's always been my most loyal
lady-in-waiting.

36:29.291 --> 36:30.875
And Ehrengard.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.833
But Ehrengard you know.

36:35.291 --> 36:36.916
The best of luck to you.

36:42.541 --> 36:45.625
That mirror needs polishing
when you have the time.

36:45.708 --> 36:51.208
On to the entrance hall. Do keep
these doors shut to prevent a draft.

36:53.166 --> 36:54.583
-Mr. Cazotte?
-Yes?

36:54.666 --> 36:57.083
-May I ask you something?
-Of course.

36:57.166 --> 37:00.416
Are you a…
Are you a court servant of sorts?

37:00.916 --> 37:05.666
No. No, I am not.
I only serve the arts. I am a painter.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.375
The entrance hall.

37:08.458 --> 37:10.041
-Mr. Cazotte.
-Yes.

37:10.875 --> 37:13.375
I remember where I first saw you.

37:14.250 --> 37:16.458
-Yes?
-At the big ball.

37:17.333 --> 37:20.916
You were standing by your portrait
of the Grand Duchess.

37:22.750 --> 37:24.875
I do not recall.

37:25.875 --> 37:28.791
I am usually good
at remembering faces, but…

37:28.875 --> 37:30.625
not yours from that evening.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.875
I didn't mean to offend you. But it…

37:33.958 --> 37:34.958
Offend me?

37:36.125 --> 37:37.166
Do as you wish.

37:53.708 --> 37:55.708
And now wave! Wave!

37:57.375 --> 37:58.291
And smile.

38:09.708 --> 38:11.833
Oh, it is like a fairy tale.

38:11.916 --> 38:13.875
I'm pleased to hear that.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.041
I tried to create a place

38:16.125 --> 38:20.125
where our Princess couldn't help
but bring a cupid into this world.

38:20.208 --> 38:22.458
-Are those for me?
-Yes, they are.

38:23.916 --> 38:25.041
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

38:25.125 --> 38:25.958
Cazotte.

38:31.333 --> 38:32.416
Your Grace.

38:34.083 --> 38:38.541
Our small court has quickly
settled into the romantic atmosphere.

38:41.333 --> 38:46.875
And as for Princess Ludmilla and the
relationship with her new lady-in-waiting,

38:46.958 --> 38:51.583
the Princess, heavy with the sweetness
of life, like a bee…

38:51.666 --> 38:55.458
…like a bee on its way to the hive…

38:56.083 --> 38:59.625
…is unable to see anything less
than a sister in her.

38:59.708 --> 39:03.958
-Is it true that your fiancé is a soldier?
-It is true.

39:06.666 --> 39:10.291
But you must be scared.
What if he is sent off to war someday?

39:11.166 --> 39:12.583
That's what soldiers do.

39:14.333 --> 39:17.875
I have taught him fencing.
Everyone in our family masters it.

39:18.625 --> 39:21.125
In return, he taught me to fire a pistol.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.416
Yes. Many times.

39:28.625 --> 39:29.875
Do you want children?

39:32.500 --> 39:38.333
As for our wager, Your Grace,
I must tell you in all honesty

39:38.416 --> 39:42.166
that progress is slow
with very few advances.

40:17.833 --> 40:18.708
Mr. Cazotte.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.583
Ah, Ehrengard.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.375
You are up early.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.583
Yes. Well, I usually am.

40:28.166 --> 40:29.416
Are you going riding?

40:30.208 --> 40:32.458
-Pardon me?
-Are you going riding?

40:33.208 --> 40:34.250
Want to join me?

40:36.208 --> 40:38.416
-But if you want to ride alone…
-No.

40:39.500 --> 40:43.750
No. No, it's fine… I think…

40:45.083 --> 40:47.250
I think that should be fine.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.875
Let me just think.

40:51.166 --> 40:52.250
Sure, why not?

40:53.875 --> 40:56.875
-Good morning, Mr. Podolski.
-Good morning, Mr. Cazotte.

40:56.958 --> 40:59.166
-Can you ready my horse?
-Your horse?

41:00.041 --> 41:02.541
Just give me the same horse as yesterday.

41:02.625 --> 41:03.625
As yesterday?

41:04.708 --> 41:05.750
Just any horse.

41:06.750 --> 41:07.791
Yes, sir.

41:13.208 --> 41:16.958
-Are you coming?
-Just go ahead. I'll catch up.

41:30.875 --> 41:34.125
You're getting tired. Are you all spent?

41:38.291 --> 41:39.125
Look.

41:42.583 --> 41:43.500
It's alpenglow.

41:44.541 --> 41:49.583
It is a rare interaction of the spectral
colours in the atmosphere.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.208
Alpenglow?

41:54.208 --> 41:55.041
Yes.

41:55.541 --> 41:56.375
Alpenglow.

42:00.125 --> 42:01.708
It's already disappearing.

42:04.166 --> 42:05.500
Yes. Naturally.

42:06.333 --> 42:11.708
It has revealed its innermost essence
and can now only annihilate itself. Boom!

42:12.750 --> 42:15.458
A clear day will follow. It's a miracle.

42:16.125 --> 42:16.958
No!

42:21.666 --> 42:25.666
Do you think it might be possible
to have my own horse brought here?

42:26.791 --> 42:27.791
Your own horse?

42:27.875 --> 42:30.083
These horses are too good-tempered.

42:30.666 --> 42:33.750
Yes. Indeed. And yours isn't?

42:33.833 --> 42:35.208
His name is Wohtan.

42:35.750 --> 42:37.458
Only I can ride him.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.375
I can imagine.

42:39.458 --> 42:40.291
Mr. Cazotte.

42:41.208 --> 42:43.125
Mr. Podolski. What's the matter?

42:43.833 --> 42:44.875
Someone's coming.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.958
-So turn them away.
-I can't. It's the Grand Duke's cousin.

43:07.208 --> 43:10.458
We're visiting the Princess.
I'm the Grand Duke's cousin.

43:10.541 --> 43:14.625
Goodness. That's nice. But no,
I'm afraid the Princess has taken ill.

43:14.708 --> 43:18.500
It's just a brief visit.
We have a basket of gifts for her.

43:18.583 --> 43:21.333
You will have to come back another day.

43:21.416 --> 43:23.375
-Or give it to me.
-Nice sausages.

43:23.458 --> 43:28.625
The Princess' condition, as you can
imagine, prevents her from seeing anyone.

43:28.708 --> 43:30.541
Are you turning me away?

43:31.041 --> 43:32.750
-I'm but a messenger.
-I insist.

43:32.833 --> 43:35.083
-Listen…
-Who do you think I am?

43:35.166 --> 43:36.458
-I'm just…
-Move!

43:38.083 --> 43:38.958
Marbod.

43:40.958 --> 43:42.125
What a surprise.

43:42.208 --> 43:47.541
We were in the vicinity. And…
We bring gifts from home for the Princess.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.458
I'll see that she gets them.
She's terribly ill.

43:50.958 --> 43:52.333
It's but a short visit.

43:53.041 --> 43:55.166
It is contagious. She's quarantined.

43:55.750 --> 43:57.000
-But…
-Goodbye.

43:57.083 --> 44:00.541
Lothar. Dearest Lothar.
It's just a very short visit.

44:09.666 --> 44:11.833
-Did you see his lies?
-Of course.

44:11.916 --> 44:16.791
And that charlatan. Did you see his rags?
Pardon me for asking, but is it carnival?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.416
We must remain close by.

44:39.250 --> 44:44.541
We brought gifts for the residents of the
castle. But they don't receive visitors.

44:45.416 --> 44:48.125
Do you know anyone employed
at the fine castle?

44:50.791 --> 44:53.125
-I mind my own business.
-Hang on.

44:58.166 --> 45:02.833
Perhaps you could reconsider your stance
a little more carefully?

45:16.208 --> 45:20.458
We're going back to Babenhausen tonight.
Now you know where to find us.

45:45.833 --> 45:46.791
Your Grace.

45:47.916 --> 45:51.375
Another month has passed
and the birth is imminent.

45:52.250 --> 45:56.250
I know that, given the nature
of the situation, you cannot visit us,

45:56.333 --> 45:59.291
so allow me to pass on
some impressions from here.

46:00.833 --> 46:03.875
Let me begin by bringing you
some happy news.

46:05.958 --> 46:08.041
A stroke of luck has transpired.

46:10.583 --> 46:14.416
I couldn't sleep
and decided to go for a walk in the woods.

46:24.833 --> 46:27.125
Here I saw her.

46:29.958 --> 46:31.333
And at once I realised

46:33.333 --> 46:37.291
that the gods had granted me
a unique motif.

46:38.666 --> 46:42.833
I was right and more than right
in my assessment of her beauty.

46:43.958 --> 46:45.666
But it was something else.

46:46.291 --> 46:50.375
The generosity of the gods
was even more inconceivable.

46:50.458 --> 46:56.541
And I ask Your Grace not to see this
as explicit or think of me as a voyeur.

46:56.625 --> 46:59.875
There was something picturesque about it.

47:00.583 --> 47:03.666
The light, the forest lake,
the woman in the water,

47:03.750 --> 47:06.458
the entire magical scenery,

47:06.541 --> 47:10.833
it all cried out
to be immortalised in art.

47:12.583 --> 47:16.791
And this painting
which I have been commanded to paint…

47:17.625 --> 47:20.291
"Nymph Bathing in a Forest Lake."

47:21.000 --> 47:25.833
Or "Diana's Bath",
would in itself be a wonder,

47:25.916 --> 47:30.291
a glory, the crowning moment
of my career as an artist.

47:35.250 --> 47:41.041
In what possible way can I more fully
make her mine than by capturing,

47:41.666 --> 47:47.458
fastening and fixing upon my canvas
every line and hue of her body,

47:47.541 --> 47:52.625
so that no one in this entire world
can separate the two of us ever again?

47:56.500 --> 47:58.625
This piece requires patience.

48:00.041 --> 48:01.041
So I wait.

48:05.500 --> 48:09.250
I never touch her hair
or even brush her hand.

48:10.083 --> 48:13.708
Instead, I approach her in other ways.

48:14.708 --> 48:16.416
Wohtan. Hi.

48:18.875 --> 48:19.875
Hi.

48:25.833 --> 48:31.291
And so the days pass, Your Grace,
with tiny, cautious steps.

48:32.666 --> 48:34.666
…for my heart.

49:00.916 --> 49:03.250
-Ehrengard.
-Hi.

49:06.541 --> 49:07.791
Thank you for the letter.

49:07.875 --> 49:10.500
-I missed you…
-But we can't meet this way.

49:11.000 --> 49:11.833
But why not?

49:13.041 --> 49:14.500
I can't and won't tell.

49:14.583 --> 49:17.250
I will be stationed here for three months.

49:18.333 --> 49:20.791
Perhaps someday I can tell you everything.

49:22.375 --> 49:23.583
Farewell, my friend.

49:46.458 --> 49:48.875
Ehrengard! The waters have broken.

50:00.916 --> 50:01.750
Not yet.

50:13.708 --> 50:16.166
Mr. Podolski, send for the Grand Duchess.

50:23.541 --> 50:26.416
-Where is the child?
-Your Grace.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.833
First, the castle trembled with fear,

50:28.916 --> 50:32.875
but when the first shrill cry rang
from the Princess' room,

50:32.958 --> 50:35.291
it changed from cellar to attic.

50:35.375 --> 50:36.750
Mr. Cazotte. Be honest.

50:37.666 --> 50:38.500
Is he healthy?

50:38.583 --> 50:43.708
He is the most beautiful child
to see the light of day in Babenhausen.

50:44.916 --> 50:46.875
There you are. Let me see him.

50:46.958 --> 50:47.875
Come.

50:50.791 --> 50:52.375
-Come.
-Let me see him.

50:52.458 --> 50:54.916
-Isn't he wonderful?
-Let me see.

51:01.416 --> 51:02.375
Congratulations.

51:05.416 --> 51:08.000
He looks like me.
He looks like Grandmother.

51:09.791 --> 51:13.458
Is he not the most beautiful
little creature you ever saw?

51:13.541 --> 51:17.916
Even I, Your Grace,
someone not prone to sentimentality,

51:18.000 --> 51:21.666
am astounded by the fairness of the child.
I must say.

51:22.791 --> 51:25.958
And Ehrengard.
How are you progressing with her?

51:29.500 --> 51:34.166
She has for the first time,
without even knowing,

51:34.875 --> 51:37.458
fallen in love.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.041
So soon?

51:42.333 --> 51:45.125
Not with me, Your Grace.
With your grandchild.

51:45.208 --> 51:46.791
-Oh!
-Yes.

51:46.875 --> 51:48.708
-Yes.
-Oh… Oh no.

51:49.666 --> 51:52.541
So she has lost all interest in you,
Mr. Cazotte?

51:52.625 --> 51:56.583
No, no, no. On the contrary.
It serves my purpose perfectly.

51:57.083 --> 52:00.916
To fall in love with the god of love
himself may very well,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.750
to a person of her collectedness
and energy,

52:03.833 --> 52:08.875
be the first step on the road towards
total surrender, Your Grace.

52:08.958 --> 52:11.458
I sense you are grasping at straws.

52:11.541 --> 52:13.125
The figure of Cupid.

52:13.208 --> 52:17.250
The embodiment of love.
The most fatal of dolls. Believe me.

52:17.333 --> 52:18.333
Mama.

52:19.416 --> 52:20.875
-Your coach awaits.
-Yes.

52:20.958 --> 52:22.375
Leaving so soon?

52:22.458 --> 52:26.041
The Marbods won't let me
out of their sight. Bah!

52:26.125 --> 52:31.291
No one… Absolutely no one
outside this castle may see the child.

52:31.375 --> 52:33.625
-Understood?
-Of course, Your Grace.

52:33.708 --> 52:36.208
-And you, Lothar?
-Of course, Mother.

52:36.291 --> 52:39.125
One last thing. We have found a wet nurse.

52:39.916 --> 52:45.583
Her name is… Lisbeth. She's a local.
We will have her brought here.

52:45.666 --> 52:49.125
-And she is reliable?
-Yes. We made inquiries.

52:49.208 --> 52:53.125
Lisbeth, please come home sometimes.
How am I to care for myself?

52:53.208 --> 52:58.541
-I made arrangements with the neighbour.
-Why do you have to live there?

52:58.625 --> 53:01.250
You could come home from time to time…

53:01.333 --> 53:02.500
Let go of the door.

53:03.208 --> 53:04.166
-Lisbeth?
-Go!

53:05.166 --> 53:06.083
Lisbeth? Can…

53:09.041 --> 53:10.666
Lisbeth. Lisbeth!

53:11.750 --> 53:12.916
Lisbeth!

53:22.791 --> 53:24.125
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

54:03.375 --> 54:06.000
-You took your time.
-I'm sorry.

54:07.541 --> 54:13.416
I've made inquiries, but no news.
Rosenbad has been utterly quiet.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.000
Then why send for us?

54:16.166 --> 54:17.958
New events have unfolded.

54:18.875 --> 54:21.000
-A drink?
-Please.

54:21.666 --> 54:25.500
Yes. Well, unfortunately I only
have a very costly one left.

54:26.375 --> 54:28.083
Then let's hope it is good.

54:30.833 --> 54:33.500
-The court has employed someone new.
-Who?

54:35.166 --> 54:36.208
A woman.

54:38.708 --> 54:42.458
-And what else?
-A woman with small children.

54:43.583 --> 54:45.500
How did you find out?

54:48.416 --> 54:50.750
You see him? He is her husband.

54:51.333 --> 54:54.791
He sits here every night in despair.

54:56.416 --> 54:57.875
You should talk to him.

55:10.833 --> 55:11.666
Pardon us.

55:12.875 --> 55:14.708
What can you tell of Rosenbad?

55:16.958 --> 55:18.541
It's all one big lie.

55:20.541 --> 55:22.083
And now I've lost my wife.

55:23.416 --> 55:26.750
She was to work at the castle
as a lady's maid.

55:28.208 --> 55:34.583
As a lady's maid to a spoiled young lady,
and I was not allowed to talk to her.

55:35.666 --> 55:36.500
But…

55:37.750 --> 55:38.583
then…

55:42.125 --> 55:44.250
No, I promised not to tell anything.

55:44.875 --> 55:45.708
My good sir.

55:46.666 --> 55:48.583
The Grand Duke is my cousin.

55:49.791 --> 55:52.708
I command you to tell what you know.

56:00.000 --> 56:00.875
There…

56:03.208 --> 56:05.666
There's already a child at the castle.

56:06.708 --> 56:07.666
I knew it.

56:08.291 --> 56:13.333
We must write to your cousin.
Say that we demand to see them.

56:13.416 --> 56:16.750
I miss her so. Can't you help me?

56:18.625 --> 56:20.041
I have a task for you.

56:21.666 --> 56:25.875
If you can get hold of the child,
you will get your Lisbeth back.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.666
-Get hold of?
-Yes.

56:30.500 --> 56:33.583
And to show our appreciation
for your heroic efforts,

56:33.666 --> 56:38.708
I will personally make sure that you get
a very prominent position at the court

56:38.791 --> 56:41.916
when my wife and I take over the throne.

56:43.750 --> 56:47.375
Don't you think that would make
your Lisbeth happy? And proud?

56:49.000 --> 56:49.833
Good.

56:50.541 --> 56:52.750
This is what you need to do.

57:25.791 --> 57:26.625
Mr. Cazotte.

57:30.791 --> 57:32.875
-Ehrengard.
-You are up early.

57:33.916 --> 57:34.750
Yes.

57:35.708 --> 57:36.541
Indeed.

57:38.250 --> 57:41.458
Yes, last night was the shortest
of the year.

57:42.000 --> 57:42.833
Really?

57:43.375 --> 57:45.583
-I didn't know.
-Yes. Truly.

57:45.666 --> 57:48.541
And I always spend
the shortest night outdoors.

57:48.625 --> 57:50.416
Outdoors? How come?

57:51.583 --> 57:55.833
It is a kind of rite.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.083
-A rite?
-Yes.

57:58.666 --> 57:59.916
What sort of rite?

58:00.000 --> 58:05.416
I am painting… I capture nature

58:05.500 --> 58:08.875
in its most fragile moment.

58:08.958 --> 58:12.041
-Fragile?
-Where it is at its most lush.

58:12.791 --> 58:16.583
Before it once again surrenders
to darkness little by little.

58:17.083 --> 58:18.833
It sounds rather sad.

58:18.916 --> 58:22.000
-No, it's not. No. I enjoy it.
-May I see?

58:23.041 --> 58:24.208
-The painting?
-Yes.

58:24.291 --> 58:27.666
-I'd rather you didn't.
-I'm sure I'll find it beautiful.

58:27.750 --> 58:33.416
-No. This painting is somewhat trivial.
-Trivial? I doubt it.

58:33.500 --> 58:37.250
Yes, it is merely flowers
with their sweet petals,

58:37.333 --> 58:43.458
nettles with their burning embrace,
the forest lake with its gentle caresses.

58:44.208 --> 58:47.166
-It is but romantic drivel.
-The forest lake?

58:47.958 --> 58:50.500
-What?
-Have you painted the forest lake?

58:56.291 --> 58:58.708
Did I say the forest lake? No. I haven't.

58:59.291 --> 59:01.833
-I'm just thinking out loud.
-Let me see it.

59:01.916 --> 59:04.416
-No, I'm just thinking out loud.
-Yes.

59:14.750 --> 59:16.375
-My hand.
-Yes.

59:18.458 --> 59:19.291
Mr. Cazotte!

59:21.250 --> 59:22.083
Mr. Cazotte.

59:22.916 --> 59:25.625
The Grand Duchess is here. She wants you.

59:29.750 --> 59:30.583
Pardon me.

59:43.041 --> 59:46.083
They insist on paying a visit.

59:46.166 --> 59:47.708
Who insists, Your Grace?

59:47.791 --> 59:48.791
The Marbods.

59:53.541 --> 59:56.875
-Can't we tell them no?
-No. Impossible. They are family.

59:57.875 --> 01:00:01.791
I made sure they won't enter Rosenbad,
and hear the child.

01:00:01.875 --> 01:00:03.625
-We'll have a picnic.
-When?

01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:05.875
This Sunday.

01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:09.833
-This Sunday?
-There's no way getting around it.

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:12.666
We must hide the child.

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:16.833
-And Ludmilla must be…
-Six months pregnant. A big girl.

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:20.875
Lisbeth is to stay here with the child,

01:00:20.958 --> 01:00:23.708
and everyone else
must be carefully instructed.

01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:27.541
Of course. I shall see to it, Your Grace.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:29.750
Very well, Mr. Cazotte.

01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:32.875
Please.

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:37.208
-Well.
-Yes.

01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:40.208
And Ehrengard?

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:44.333
Well, as you know
I have painted her every morning.

01:00:45.125 --> 01:00:50.125
And even though she hasn't necessarily
been aware of my presence,

01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:56.458
my existence, I really feel as though
we've established a connection between us.

01:00:57.875 --> 01:01:00.291
I know what you are thinking, Your Grace.

01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:02.083
-Do you now?
-Yes, indeed.

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:05.166
Why doesn't that silly fool just

01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:09.541
seduce the girl the old-fashioned way
and set his mind at rest?

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.083
-Am I right?
-More or less, yes.

01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:17.125
But that silly fool is…

01:01:19.166 --> 01:01:20.291
…an artist.

01:01:20.375 --> 01:01:26.500
At this moment absorbed and intoxicated
by the creation of a masterpiece.

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:31.125
I insist on obtaining full surrender

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:35.666
without any kind
of physical touch whatsoever.

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:41.750
I could seduce the girl the old-fashioned
way and it'd be less difficult.

01:01:41.833 --> 01:01:48.250
I could seduce her at a special moment,
where her soul is agitated, impulsive.

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:53.625
But, Your Grace, I simply feel
that it would not mean anything to me.

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:57.000
You sound like you have realised

01:01:57.083 --> 01:02:01.583
that you cannot win our wager,
and now you want to alter the conditions.

01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:05.208
By no means.
I still intend to seduce her, Your Grace.

01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:09.750
It will happen. But the difference is
she will be the only one to know.

01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:13.875
For others, Ehrengard will still sit
on her little pedestal,

01:02:13.958 --> 01:02:18.375
a snow-white virgin,
but our souls will forever be connected.

01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:22.541
And that is a true seduction.

01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:28.375
And how are we to know
that the girl has been seduced…

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:32.083
-How to know who has won our wager?
-Precisely.

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:35.083
I will show her the painting
I've created of her,

01:02:35.166 --> 01:02:38.750
and at that very moment, she will falter.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.666
She will be the rose
that drops every petal

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:47.416
at a single breath of wind
and stand bared, Your Grace.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:53.708
When one surrenders to passion,
the body will follow suit.

01:02:54.458 --> 01:03:00.625
When she sees the painting,
she will simply… swoon.

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.833
She will swoon? Our Ehrengard?

01:03:17.916 --> 01:03:22.500
In front of everyone, and that will be
the proof of absolute seduction.

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:37.916
I accept the new terms of our wager.

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:25.083
Should I ready your horse, Miss Ehrengard?

01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:52.000
Lisbeth!

01:04:56.416 --> 01:04:58.625
Lisbeth!

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:03.583
Lisbeth!

01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:06.250
What is going on?

01:05:08.666 --> 01:05:12.458
My good sir, wait a minute.
Why are you wandering around yelling?

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:19.916
He threatened me. He utterly confused me.

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:23.083
Now I've made a terrible mistake.

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:26.916
He…

01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:32.250
He promised me I would get my Lisbeth back
if I helped him.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:33.583
Your Lisbeth?

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.583
My…

01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:40.291
My Lisbeth has been taken from me.

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:44.541
-Lisbeth has been taken from you?
-And now I have…

01:05:45.416 --> 01:05:49.166
I've made a terrible mistake.

01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:52.458
What mistake are you talking about?

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:57.958
The fine folk at Rosenbad
have lied about the child.

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:01.416
I've been tricked.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:03.125
But…

01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:05.583
Now I have to help.

01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:09.041
In what way are you to help?

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:17.958
Tomorrow…

01:06:19.958 --> 01:06:22.750
I am to steal a child and show it to them.

01:06:26.166 --> 01:06:29.541
At two o'clock, I must go
to the clearing in the woods.

01:06:29.625 --> 01:06:32.416
Now I'm wondering
if it's the right thing to do.

01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:36.041
I have to talk to my Lisbeth first.

01:06:37.958 --> 01:06:40.916
I don't think
Lisbeth will forgive me afterwards.

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:50.625
Listen.

01:06:51.583 --> 01:06:52.958
Are you listening?

01:06:58.375 --> 01:06:59.666
Proceed as planned.

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.208
Do you understand?

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:04.916
What?

01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:06.791
Proceed as planned.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:09.500
And keep Lisbeth out of it.

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.333
Everything will be fine.

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:20.041
Now go!

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.708
Where have you been?

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:10.041
-Everyone is looking for you.
-Here I am.

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:12.125
The picnic will begin in a moment.

01:08:12.625 --> 01:08:14.791
All is prepared. Everything.

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:16.625
-Yes?
-Yes.

01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:20.875
You look pale.
Are you feeling crestfallen?

01:08:20.958 --> 01:08:22.916
No, no, no. All is good.

01:08:37.958 --> 01:08:39.958
-And the cutlery?
-At the bottom.

01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.291
We still need chairs.

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:42.375
Cazotte?

01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:45.375
Ehrengard.

01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:53.833
Apologies for not being at the lake today.

01:08:58.958 --> 01:08:59.791
At the lake?

01:09:04.125 --> 01:09:06.250
I've known all along you were there.

01:09:11.083 --> 01:09:15.333
And I was only absent
because my presence was needed here.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:24.041
I would like…

01:09:27.916 --> 01:09:29.708
…you to finish the painting.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:34.583
But I was thinking…

01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:41.166
…we might do it in your chamber.

01:09:44.833 --> 01:09:47.833
Perhaps you need to be a little closer.

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:58.291
Face to face.

01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:05.083
Yes.

01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:08.333
Naturally. Yes.

01:10:09.875 --> 01:10:11.458
Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely.

01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:14.750
-Are you able to picture that?
-Yes.

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:17.416
Close your eyes.

01:10:19.166 --> 01:10:21.708
-Pardon?
-Close your eyes.

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:25.208
-Now?
-Yes.

01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:30.166
And picture it.

01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:41.916
Yes, I want…

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:44.833
Very well.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.708
Prepare everything.

01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:51.333
Ready the canvas.
I will be there after lunch.

01:10:51.416 --> 01:10:53.333
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.250
Yes.

01:10:55.625 --> 01:10:57.833
Yes, you'll be there after lunch.

01:11:08.458 --> 01:11:09.291
Cheers.

01:11:13.625 --> 01:11:15.708
Such a nice place, don't you think?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:24.833
Dear Marbod.

01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:32.000
It is our great pleasure to welcome you
and your dear wife.

01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:36.375
It is a great pleasure…

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.250
Yes, I think you just told us.

01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:42.291
Yes.

01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:45.333
And I am pleased…

01:11:48.291 --> 01:11:53.000
…that Princess Ludmilla is feeling
well enough to be with us today.

01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:54.083
It is wonderful.

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:57.708
And that… the weather…

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:06.875
And now I won't say much more than that
it is a pleasure to bid you welcome.

01:12:06.958 --> 01:12:08.833
The pleasure is entirely ours.

01:12:08.916 --> 01:12:10.458
-Cheers.
-It is wonderful.

01:12:10.541 --> 01:12:11.875
Cheers.

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:13.958
Cheers.

01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:25.375
-It's a lovely wine.
-Yes, very.

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:26.833
It's light and sparkly.

01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:31.208
May I have the crayfish?

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:33.750
Thank you.

01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:36.625
-Crayfish?
-No, thank you.

01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:37.541
Snap, snap.

01:12:38.166 --> 01:12:40.250
We've been lucky with the weather.

01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:44.000
-Not too hot or cold. Just right.
-Lovely weather.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.291
-It is chanterelle.
-It is.

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:43.208
It is indeed.

01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:45.458
The gold of the forest.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.583
There, there.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.333
No!

01:14:19.958 --> 01:14:20.791
Matthias!

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:22.750
Wha… Ma…

01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:25.375
No. You…

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:27.916
Sto…

01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:30.500
-Delicious.
-Very delicious.

01:14:34.166 --> 01:14:35.000
Yes.

01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:40.166
This comedy has lasted long enough.

01:14:41.458 --> 01:14:44.708
-Comedy?
-Please stay out of this.

01:14:46.208 --> 01:14:47.208
Yes.

01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:50.708
Dear Princess.

01:14:51.833 --> 01:14:52.666
Allow us.

01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:04.166
So full of life.

01:15:06.416 --> 01:15:07.250
So soft.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.375
It is very soft. One might think…

01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:11.541
Apologies!

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:14.750
-Apologies!
-Matthias!

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.625
Here comes my good man.

01:15:17.708 --> 01:15:20.083
What are you doing? Matthias!

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.166
Come, Matthias.

01:15:26.166 --> 01:15:27.375
-Come, come.
-Stop!

01:15:27.875 --> 01:15:29.125
Matthias, come. Come.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.166
Matthias!

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:32.583
Go on, Matthias.

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.166
-Mat…
-Go on!

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:35.208
Matthias!

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:37.541
-What are you doing?
-Come on, go on.

01:15:41.916 --> 01:15:43.083
Pardon me.

01:15:43.166 --> 01:15:44.000
Matthias!

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.666
Matthi… Ma…

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.666
Matthias! Stop.

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:53.000
There, there. I know.

01:15:54.208 --> 01:15:56.000
Matthias, stop!

01:15:58.166 --> 01:15:59.000
Come.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.333
No!

01:16:00.416 --> 01:16:01.416
No, no, no!

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.750
-Stay. Eat, Poggendorf.
-Stop!

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:05.750
-Hold my hand.
-Stop!

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:06.916
Oh, Poggendorf.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:07.833
Stop!

01:16:07.916 --> 01:16:08.750
Mr. Podolski.

01:16:10.291 --> 01:16:11.291
Ehrengard!

01:16:12.666 --> 01:16:13.666
Ehrengard, wait!

01:16:14.416 --> 01:16:15.416
Come on. Go.

01:16:29.041 --> 01:16:31.458
Come on. Stop! Wait!

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:37.041
The coachman is gone.

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:40.250
Poggendorf, get in.
Your Grace, come with me.

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:42.208
-Quick!
-Help me get in.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:43.958
For God's sake.

01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:45.791
-Be quiet.
-You be quiet.

01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:49.500
-Thank you.
-Go!

01:16:57.541 --> 01:16:58.541
Come on.

01:17:05.958 --> 01:17:06.958
Easy, easy, stop!

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:10.625
Come on. Go.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.166
If I say it's on the right,
it's on the right.

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:20.375
-It's on the left.
-You foolish woman!

01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:23.000
No. I said it's on the right,
so I go right.

01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:25.333
Faster, faster.

01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:36.708
I told you, the tracks lead that way.
Why won't you listen?

01:17:52.416 --> 01:17:53.541
You!

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.333
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

01:17:58.416 --> 01:17:59.875
Stop! That's enough!

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.000
What is going on?

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:07.791
So help me God, I am an innocent man.

01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:10.500
It is very unjust of this woman
to attack me.

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:13.041
Well.

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:16.125
Nice try, dear cousin.

01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:20.166
I don't understand.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:22.666
This child…

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:23.750
is mine.

01:18:38.791 --> 01:18:39.916
Yes, that is true.

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:43.458
This child is hers.

01:18:45.708 --> 01:18:46.625
Say that again.

01:18:47.416 --> 01:18:53.916
I shall say it again and again.
It is my child!

01:18:55.916 --> 01:18:57.208
That is not true.

01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.166
It is.

01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:59.875
It is. Yes.

01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:01.375
I can assure you it is.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:02.833
Yes.

01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:07.041
Ask Lisbeth. She will confirm.

01:19:07.125 --> 01:19:12.416
That man is indeed her husband.
He kidnapped the child and its wet nurse.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.125
-I followed them and found them here.
-That…

01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:16.458
That is not true.

01:19:16.541 --> 01:19:17.583
-It is.
-It is.

01:19:19.666 --> 01:19:21.708
Who is the father of the child?

01:19:24.166 --> 01:19:25.208
I shall tell you.

01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:30.750
Cazotte.

01:19:33.083 --> 01:19:34.083
Yes.

01:19:36.541 --> 01:19:41.125
Please send for a coach and have our child
brought back to Rosenbad.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:49.208
That dandy!

01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:52.875
Well. You must prove it.

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:03.416
Prove it?
How on earth should they do that?

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.041
Should we wait for him to grow older,

01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:08.958
so we can see
if he takes after his father?

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:12.125
You are making a fool of us!

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:13.750
Proof!

01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:15.833
I demand proof.

01:20:19.416 --> 01:20:21.083
-Cazotte.
-Yes?

01:20:23.708 --> 01:20:26.166
Show them your notebook.

01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:36.791
-Your notebook.
-My notebook?

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:40.666
My note… Yes.

01:20:41.166 --> 01:20:42.041
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:20:42.125 --> 01:20:44.375
-It's necessary, apparently.
-Yes.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.541
I would love to,
but I don't have it with me.

01:20:50.625 --> 01:20:51.583
I don't have…

01:20:52.083 --> 01:20:53.083
-You do.
-No.

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:56.250
Isn't it in your left coat pocket?

01:21:26.708 --> 01:21:27.541
Yes.

01:21:38.041 --> 01:21:39.041
Ehrengard.

01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:40.375
Kurt?

01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:44.541
-Not now. Not now!
-What about…

01:22:03.416 --> 01:22:04.250
No.

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:19.875
Will that suffice?

01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:51.666
There now. Come. Come.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:53.833
There.

01:22:54.666 --> 01:22:55.500
Come.

01:22:58.708 --> 01:23:00.458
Tomorrow at dawn.

01:23:01.208 --> 01:23:02.208
Kurt!

01:23:05.083 --> 01:23:06.291
Come. Let's go.

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:36.416
-Would you like to choose first?
-No. You go ahead.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.333
Very well.

01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:47.125
Help him.

01:23:50.833 --> 01:23:52.083
-Right.
-Here you are.

01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:54.541
Are you ready?

01:23:56.458 --> 01:24:00.833
Pardon me, but I don't understand
why we can't discuss this like adults.

01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:03.083
Twenty steps. Or perhaps less?

01:24:04.583 --> 01:24:05.458
Twenty steps.

01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:08.750
Please consider…

01:24:09.458 --> 01:24:11.208
One. Two.

01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:13.250
Three.

01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:14.333
Four.

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:15.500
Five.

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:16.541
Six.

01:24:16.625 --> 01:24:17.458
Seven.

01:24:17.958 --> 01:24:18.791
Eight.

01:24:19.583 --> 01:24:20.416
Nine.

01:24:20.916 --> 01:24:21.916
Ten.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.041
Eleven.

01:24:23.583 --> 01:24:25.250
Twelve. Thirteen.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:26.833
Fourteen.

01:24:27.583 --> 01:24:28.666
Fifteen.

01:24:29.333 --> 01:24:30.166
Sixteen.

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:32.458
Seventeen.

01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:33.875
Eighteen.

01:24:34.416 --> 01:24:35.250
Nineteen.

01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:43.916
Goddammit, I've been hit!

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:49.791
I've been hit. I've been hit!

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.125
Stop!

01:24:58.291 --> 01:24:59.125
Wait!

01:25:23.083 --> 01:25:30.083
Ego te baptizo, in nomine Patris,
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

01:25:32.791 --> 01:25:38.458
Quique dedit tibi remissionem,
omnium peccatorum ipse te liniat.

01:25:38.958 --> 01:25:40.208
In vitam eaternam.

01:25:41.083 --> 01:25:42.083
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:44.208
Peace be with you.

01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:46.625
And with your spirit.

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:50.250
At long last, a little more
than a year after their wedding,

01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:55.625
Prince Lothar and Princess Ludmilla
baptised their firstborn.

01:25:55.708 --> 01:26:00.125
Deus omnipotens,
Pater Domini nostri Iesu Christi,

01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:03.791
qui te regeneravit ex aqua
et Spiritu Sancto.

01:26:03.875 --> 01:26:06.208
Here ends the story of Ehrengard.

01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:09.875
For this occasion,
she wore across her white frock

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:12.708
the blue ribbon
of the Order of Saint Stephan.

01:26:12.791 --> 01:26:14.708
An order given to noble ladies

01:26:14.791 --> 01:26:17.750
in recognition of their service
to Babenhausen.

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:22.500
I was present, but received no order.

01:26:25.833 --> 01:26:26.666
Yes.

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:42.083
Now.

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:44.166
Now!

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:55.416
I later went to Rome.

01:27:01.625 --> 01:27:04.291
Here I received
many prestigious assignments

01:27:04.375 --> 01:27:08.291
where I could further develop
my great artistic talent.

01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:11.375
Grazie.

01:27:36.416 --> 01:27:40.083
Furthermore,
my friends gave me my pseudonym.

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:43.916
They called me…

01:27:49.166 --> 01:27:50.083
…Casanova.
