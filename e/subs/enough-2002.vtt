00:47.546 --> 00:49.070
Here you go. Thank you.

00:49.148 --> 00:51.048
I'll be right back with your order.

00:54.820 --> 00:55.980
Good morning, Bill.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.029
Let me guess. Pancakes, side of bacon.

01:07.532 --> 01:09.363
Who's dying? Come on, pick it up.

01:10.201 --> 01:12.567
Phil, Big Papa, please? I need 15.

01:12.771 --> 01:15.069
I love it when you call me Big Papa.

01:17.108 --> 01:19.042
Hey, you're up early today.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.911
Okay, you're good to go.

01:25.984 --> 01:27.315
Is this yours?

01:33.992 --> 01:35.550
Does that line ever work?

01:35.860 --> 01:37.521
What's the problem here?

01:38.496 --> 01:39.724
It's hot!

01:47.938 --> 01:49.303
Here you go.

01:50.374 --> 01:51.636
Sorry.

01:59.416 --> 02:04.115
Why not? My grandfather was a lawyer.
Plus, I have a logical mind.

02:04.354 --> 02:09.189
And you're only, like, what?
$299,000 short of what you need for law school?

02:09.393 --> 02:11.020
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of pie.

02:11.095 --> 02:13.962
Piece of ass. So what would you do?

02:15.599 --> 02:17.567
- I don't know.
- Liar.

02:17.968 --> 02:21.529
You know, I was thinking
I could go back to school full-time.

02:22.773 --> 02:25.901
And quit here? I won't allow it, Slim.

02:26.176 --> 02:28.144
- Careful, it's hot.
- Sorry, sir.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.181
- Ever try the Roc?
- What?

02:34.017 --> 02:38.009
It's the deodorant thing.
It's like salts or something.

02:38.955 --> 02:43.415
You rub it on your pits.
It looks like some kind of hippie crystal.

02:46.162 --> 02:48.357
- Are you saying I sweat?
- No, you just...

02:48.431 --> 02:51.025
- Do I smell?
- No. God...

02:52.034 --> 02:54.662
- Ladies?
- Okay. Your turn.

02:55.071 --> 02:56.436
I'm sweating too much.

03:05.281 --> 03:06.771
You waiting for somebody?

03:09.385 --> 03:11.580
- Something to drink?
- Just water, thanks.

03:12.188 --> 03:13.917
I'll give you a minute to look at the menu.

03:13.990 --> 03:17.221
That's okay. I was in here yesterday, Slim.

03:19.562 --> 03:21.792
- What's your real name?
- No.

03:23.132 --> 03:26.033
I like it. Don't you think
it's kind of negative, though?

03:26.102 --> 03:27.830
No, I don't tell my name.

03:28.970 --> 03:30.130
Okay.

03:30.505 --> 03:35.238
Give me the soup, turkey burger,
coleslaw, couple of extra slices of tomato.

03:35.410 --> 03:38.436
I write books. Do you read books?
What are you reading now?

03:41.917 --> 03:45.717
You know Finnegans Wake by James Joyce?

03:46.121 --> 03:49.249
My friend told me it's the hardest book
in the English language.

03:49.324 --> 03:53.556
I mean, not the hardest,
but the hardest one that you can actually read.

03:53.829 --> 03:57.890
I thought to myself, if I can get through it,
I could probably read the rest.

03:57.966 --> 04:00.298
- How long have you been reading it?
- Six years.

04:00.669 --> 04:02.261
I'll be back with your soup.

04:04.906 --> 04:07.170
- He likes you.
- He's a dick.

04:08.577 --> 04:11.978
- He was in here yesterday, you know?
- I know.

04:12.047 --> 04:16.915
Now he's back today, he brought a rose,
he pulls you into conversation.

04:17.517 --> 04:18.951
Okay, so he likes me.

04:19.153 --> 04:22.919
- So, do you like him?
- I don't know him.

04:23.858 --> 04:28.454
What's that got to do with anything?
He's a major piece of cake, piece of pie.

04:29.630 --> 04:32.155
Trust me, okay? He's carrot cake.

04:33.067 --> 04:37.128
And when a guy like that,
who's actually cuter than you, likes you...

04:37.671 --> 04:39.036
He's cuter than me?

04:39.106 --> 04:42.234
Face it, no one will ever go for you
because of your looks.

04:42.443 --> 04:45.310
That sucks, because my personality bites.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.740
Cup of soup.

04:53.888 --> 04:55.822
You don't really write books, do you?

04:56.223 --> 04:57.019
No.

04:57.157 --> 05:00.456
I haven't really been reading
Finnegans Wake either.

05:01.996 --> 05:03.327
I'm going into law...

05:03.931 --> 05:05.057
...enforcement.

05:06.166 --> 05:07.598
Who's the rose for?

05:11.905 --> 05:13.065
Enjoy your grub.

05:14.274 --> 05:15.263
Hey!

05:19.946 --> 05:20.935
You.

05:27.153 --> 05:28.711
How much did you settle on?

05:30.990 --> 05:32.287
Excuse me?

05:32.992 --> 05:35.358
The bet. How much is it?

05:40.333 --> 05:43.097
You and your friend, yesterday, was it $200?

05:43.636 --> 05:46.036
Was it $500? What was it?

05:48.074 --> 05:49.063
What?

05:50.843 --> 05:52.572
He bet his friend...

05:53.446 --> 05:56.347
...that he could get into your pants
by noon tomorrow.

05:57.849 --> 06:00.283
Is this your business?
Are you the morals police?

06:01.887 --> 06:04.651
Take it easy, man. I was just having some fun.

06:06.124 --> 06:08.684
What was it? $200 or $500?

06:10.195 --> 06:11.958
I want to know what I'm worth.

06:13.298 --> 06:14.731
The bet was for $200.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.835
But now that I know you...

06:19.705 --> 06:21.036
...way too high.

06:26.044 --> 06:27.636
Don't come back here again...

06:28.046 --> 06:29.013
...ever.

06:39.157 --> 06:40.954
I'm sorry to get in your business.

06:41.259 --> 06:42.590
No. Thanks.

06:43.829 --> 06:46.263
I can't believe you actually said something.

06:46.964 --> 06:48.591
I'd have felt bad about it...

06:49.100 --> 06:50.590
...if I'd have kept quiet.

06:52.536 --> 06:53.935
Good luck.

07:34.345 --> 07:38.940
Please tell me, Phil, as Mitch was rather vague...

07:39.783 --> 07:41.546
...is her father dead, too?

07:41.785 --> 07:45.744
Well, he is to her.
He left when she was maybe two or three.

07:46.923 --> 07:51.087
- Then I'm happy to pay for the wedding.
- Yes, we're very happy.

07:53.463 --> 07:54.930
You sure you love me?

07:57.167 --> 07:58.725
Forever and ever?

08:01.304 --> 08:02.828
You're safe with me, Slim.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.599
You're safe, and it's okay to be happy.
We deserve it.

08:13.149 --> 08:16.846
- Wait, so this was during or after college?
- During.

08:19.823 --> 08:21.347
What's wrong with you?

08:23.326 --> 08:26.261
No, I mean, why did you and Slim break up?

08:28.263 --> 08:29.890
I'm terrible in bed.

08:31.233 --> 08:34.566
Plus, she had to drop out,
some money problems...

08:34.635 --> 08:37.126
...and so we kind of evolved into being friends.

08:41.677 --> 08:43.304
What do you think?

08:52.821 --> 08:54.880
Can I take you home right now?

08:55.257 --> 08:57.088
If you've got a sense of humor.

08:57.526 --> 08:59.585
My kids are out for tonight...

08:59.661 --> 09:03.791
I live in Seattle.
Women always want the possibility of long-term.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.324
I didn't just propose.

09:07.102 --> 09:09.332
I just thought that maybe we could...

09:09.404 --> 09:13.602
...have a brief,
totally unsatisfying sexual encounter.

09:15.210 --> 09:16.574
I'm your guy.

09:22.783 --> 09:25.411
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

09:26.754 --> 09:30.019
...but I've got to get up at 5:00 in the morning
to buy green beans.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.251
Now...

09:31.826 --> 09:35.728
...I know you don't need it,
but it's tradition in my family...

09:36.531 --> 09:39.864
...to give money to the groom.
- That's sweet.

09:41.502 --> 09:45.097
Thank you, Phil.
And thank you for giving me away today.

09:45.806 --> 09:48.400
You're the best substitute father a girl ever had.

09:48.743 --> 09:51.007
No substitute. I'm the real thing.

09:53.648 --> 09:54.876
Thank you.

10:00.922 --> 10:02.287
He really loves you.

10:03.991 --> 10:05.151
Yeah.

10:07.861 --> 10:09.522
You gonna give me babies, Slim?

10:10.997 --> 10:12.157
Yeah.

10:13.099 --> 10:14.589
How soon?

10:16.503 --> 10:18.334
How soon can we get out of here?

10:25.812 --> 10:27.609
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:28.548 --> 10:30.311
We've been driving around...

10:30.817 --> 10:34.810
...and my wife has fallen completely in love
with your house.

10:36.423 --> 10:38.050
Yes, it's great, isn't it?

10:39.092 --> 10:42.619
We want to buy it. She wants it for our family.

10:46.466 --> 10:50.300
- Well, it's... We're not selling.
- Sure you are.

10:52.038 --> 10:53.369
That's the price.

10:55.141 --> 10:57.005
Don't worry, it's well over market.

11:01.013 --> 11:03.880
- You're out of your mind.
- I know, that's just it.

11:04.350 --> 11:06.181
So before you say no again...

11:07.186 --> 11:10.713
...think how miserable one determined,
crazy person can make you.

11:11.090 --> 11:15.584
Miserable today, tomorrow,
pretty much every day, until the day you sell.

11:17.529 --> 11:20.657
Your kids are grown,
you'll be happier in a smaller place.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.314
Parker, how are you? How's the jump shot?

11:46.158 --> 11:46.919
Mitch!

11:46.991 --> 11:49.482
- Not now, sweetie.
- It's Slim.

11:50.094 --> 11:51.755
Give me a second. Yeah?

11:53.031 --> 11:54.157
What?

11:56.267 --> 12:00.465
Hey, Parker!
Parker, give me a ride to the hospital.

12:01.105 --> 12:02.572
Look after the client.

12:20.124 --> 12:22.456
She looks just like my baby pictures.

12:25.029 --> 12:26.257
Don't you?

12:32.904 --> 12:33.962
Who was that?

12:34.505 --> 12:37.940
I don't know. Who cares?
Some construction thing.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.203
Bring her here. Let me see.

12:40.277 --> 12:43.007
That's my baby, that's my baby.

12:57.794 --> 12:59.125
What do you got there?

13:01.998 --> 13:04.193
Okay. Let's put it out here.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.528
What's that one?

13:29.291 --> 13:30.280
Hey.

13:35.631 --> 13:36.620
Hey.

13:36.966 --> 13:38.490
Should I join you?

13:40.803 --> 13:42.395
No. I'm about to get out.

13:44.206 --> 13:47.437
I'm just showering to wake myself up.
I got to go back to work.

13:48.878 --> 13:50.539
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

13:52.815 --> 13:53.975
Me, too.

15:16.864 --> 15:18.923
Hi, darling. Where are you?

15:21.301 --> 15:23.496
You just paged my husband, right?

15:23.770 --> 15:25.101
Oh, my God.

15:25.706 --> 15:26.695
Mitch?

15:28.876 --> 15:30.639
Who are you? What's your name?

15:31.545 --> 15:33.103
I'm so sorry, l...

15:33.280 --> 15:35.805
No, it's too late to deny it now.

15:37.351 --> 15:40.013
- Your name?
- I have to go.

15:40.220 --> 15:42.950
Don't hang up. Don't be a coward.

15:46.527 --> 15:48.085
Just tell me your name.

15:48.729 --> 15:51.163
That's the least you could do, don't you think?

15:52.199 --> 15:54.929
I'm Darcelle. I'm very sorry.

16:51.856 --> 16:52.845
Hey.

16:57.596 --> 16:58.858
She paged you.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.322
Who?

17:03.168 --> 17:04.863
Number 33. Darcelle.

17:11.409 --> 17:12.876
I guess you're late.

17:19.217 --> 17:20.775
She's French?

17:21.752 --> 17:23.983
- She's not important.
- No?

17:24.489 --> 17:26.150
- You're important.
- Yeah.

17:26.724 --> 17:28.157
And Gracie.

17:32.097 --> 17:33.826
I must be brain-dead.

17:34.132 --> 17:38.227
I must be the biggest moron on the planet
because I thought we were happy.

17:38.502 --> 17:39.764
Were we happy?

17:40.604 --> 17:42.697
And I used to think we were so lucky.

17:43.774 --> 17:45.765
And I thought in bed we were still...

17:45.943 --> 17:47.934
- Slim, please.
- No.

17:48.512 --> 17:51.379
- You said I was safe with you.
- You are.

17:51.682 --> 17:53.946
You are. I promise.

17:56.754 --> 17:57.948
I'm sorry.

17:59.623 --> 18:02.285
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

18:12.970 --> 18:15.029
Everything is going to be okay.

18:26.582 --> 18:28.447
- I can smell her.
- What?

18:29.619 --> 18:31.143
Her perfume.

18:32.088 --> 18:35.319
- Darcelle, or whoever.
- We just had a drink.

18:35.391 --> 18:36.483
Stop it!

18:37.126 --> 18:41.722
You're caught! I caught you!
And you won't talk your way out of this.

18:44.534 --> 18:45.660
How many, Mitch?

18:47.370 --> 18:50.464
How many are there?
How many have there been?

18:50.740 --> 18:52.139
What does it matter?

18:54.977 --> 18:59.539
It's not that our sex life hasn't been good.
It's been great, Slim. But I'm a man.

19:00.583 --> 19:02.517
Men and women have different needs...

19:03.953 --> 19:05.853
...and that's okay. Darcelle's...

19:06.656 --> 19:11.184
She's willing to take care of that,
and maybe that's better for everybody.

19:11.494 --> 19:12.961
It's better for you!

19:14.063 --> 19:16.156
You have a pretty good deal, don't you?

19:16.232 --> 19:20.930
You go out, you fool around!
I sit here, take care of your house and kid.

19:21.670 --> 19:23.160
Well, no more, Mitch!

19:23.605 --> 19:25.573
That's it! The party is over!

19:25.640 --> 19:28.131
- Calm down.
- I won't do this anymore.

19:28.543 --> 19:32.309
I won't sit here and take it, and take it, and take it.

19:32.581 --> 19:35.141
Sorry! I love you, yes.

19:35.584 --> 19:39.953
But I am not a doormat!
I'm your wife. I'm your wife.

19:40.455 --> 19:44.118
And you cannot do this to me!
You cannot do this to me anymore.

19:50.499 --> 19:52.967
What? I can't hit you?

19:56.204 --> 19:57.535
No, you can't.

20:04.079 --> 20:05.546
You want to fight?

20:06.148 --> 20:08.012
I'm a man, honey, it's no contest.

20:09.183 --> 20:11.674
You have to understand, and I thought you did.

20:12.186 --> 20:16.748
I make the money here,
so I set the rules, right? It's my rules.

20:17.391 --> 20:18.722
You're with me?

20:20.528 --> 20:21.825
It's your rules.

20:22.663 --> 20:23.652
Yeah.

20:24.698 --> 20:27.929
- And what if I don't like the rules?
- If you don't like them?

20:29.603 --> 20:32.766
Come on, sweetie,
life isn't just stuff we like, is it?

20:33.207 --> 20:35.539
We have to take the good with the bad.

20:36.143 --> 20:37.974
That's what marriage is.

20:41.248 --> 20:45.844
So, for you, maybe today is a bad day.
Tomorrow may be great.

20:47.555 --> 20:49.420
Tomorrow will be great.

20:52.026 --> 20:53.015
Yeah.

20:54.762 --> 20:56.093
Today...

20:57.263 --> 20:59.959
...is the price you pay for having such a good life.

21:00.967 --> 21:02.195
I'm going to go out.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.039
This will be better, don't you think?

21:08.107 --> 21:11.543
I don't have to sneak around
and pretend I'm going to work. I can say:

21:13.079 --> 21:16.640
"I'm going to Darcelle's.
I'll be back in a few hours."

21:30.897 --> 21:34.765
Just so you don't do anything later
you might regret. Okay?

22:23.615 --> 22:24.980
Who are you calling?

22:27.519 --> 22:28.508
Your mother.

22:29.488 --> 22:30.887
What will you tell her?

22:31.657 --> 22:34.956
I was supposed to bring Gracie by tomorrow,
so I better cancel.

22:37.728 --> 22:39.787
You know, love is a scary thing.

22:40.965 --> 22:43.456
How powerful it is, what it does to you.

22:45.136 --> 22:46.831
That is what happened here.

22:48.306 --> 22:50.297
See, if I ever think of...

22:52.743 --> 22:54.506
I just... I can't...

22:55.246 --> 22:58.215
I refuse to live without you.

23:00.918 --> 23:03.318
I think you understand what I'm saying.

23:22.707 --> 23:24.675
Hey, you're late.

23:25.009 --> 23:28.842
Where have you been? You are late.
I was worried you weren't coming at all.

23:31.648 --> 23:33.138
No Gracie?

23:35.452 --> 23:37.682
We will have a regular girls' luncheon...

23:37.754 --> 23:40.416
...and we will gossip about absolutely everybody.

23:47.864 --> 23:49.991
My poor baby. My God.

23:50.266 --> 23:51.756
Honey, I am so sorry.

23:57.874 --> 24:00.866
What did you do? What did you say to him?

24:05.115 --> 24:06.912
Men are like land mines.

24:07.751 --> 24:11.050
Some you trigger the first week,
others it's years in.

24:11.221 --> 24:13.587
The problem is you want a man-man.

24:13.957 --> 24:18.757
Meaning his veins run thick with testosterone,
which is good.

24:18.961 --> 24:22.158
But then he can turn around
without any warning and...

24:22.931 --> 24:23.920
...hit you.

24:24.366 --> 24:26.163
I'm not this person.

24:27.870 --> 24:30.896
I'm not a person whose husband beats her up.

24:31.206 --> 24:32.537
I know.

24:39.815 --> 24:41.442
What do I do?

24:43.585 --> 24:44.950
You got to go to the cops.

24:47.890 --> 24:52.657
He's the father of my child, okay?
I will not put him in jail!

24:53.629 --> 24:55.221
Hold on. I'm sorry.

24:55.931 --> 24:59.833
I'm sorry, okay? Sit down. Relax for a second.

25:03.338 --> 25:07.740
I'm just saying that either you endure this...

25:07.809 --> 25:11.643
...and you live it out like you're
in some goddamn country western song...

25:11.879 --> 25:16.077
...or you take the kid,
you take Gracie and you get out.

25:24.859 --> 25:28.420
Mrs. Hiller, how are you? Your husband got her.

25:30.798 --> 25:32.026
I must've forgotten.

25:32.100 --> 25:35.365
Gracie was totally psyched.
I told him he should do it more often.

25:50.952 --> 25:51.941
Mitch!

25:53.454 --> 25:54.716
Toots!

25:57.457 --> 25:58.446
Gracie!

26:25.719 --> 26:27.584
Is that my little croissant?

26:27.954 --> 26:29.615
No, it's your loaf of bread.

26:30.123 --> 26:31.590
Oh, hi. How is it going?

26:33.927 --> 26:36.293
- Where are you?
- Zoo.

26:37.797 --> 26:41.062
- Why didn't you tell me...
- I called you at home, left messages.

26:41.501 --> 26:42.490
Hey, Daddy.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.867
- Come here.
- It's your mom, honey.

26:44.938 --> 26:47.462
Mom, the elephants are peeing.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.431
She's a little excited.

26:49.975 --> 26:54.002
Hey, Dad, here. Come here. Look at the giraffe.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.806
So, when are you guys going to be home?

27:00.085 --> 27:04.613
I don't know. I'll take her for a pony ride,
maybe get a cotton candy.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.191
You want a cotton candy, honey?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.958
- I'll see you later.
- 'Bye, Mommy.

27:19.271 --> 27:22.138
Made me nervous
when I couldn't reach you today.

27:27.713 --> 27:30.307
I thought you were going to cancel
with my mother.

27:34.086 --> 27:37.145
And you have to go crying to the old gang
at the greasy spoon.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.085
Whatever happened to privacy?

27:42.961 --> 27:46.226
I guess it's dead, along with chivalry and fidelity.

27:48.299 --> 27:49.459
Tell me.

27:50.635 --> 27:52.193
Do you have any idea...

27:52.770 --> 27:54.431
...how bad things can get?

27:56.741 --> 27:58.231
Educate me.

27:58.476 --> 28:02.537
Slim, I'm a determined man.
I was determined to have you, and I did.

28:03.948 --> 28:06.416
This house, my company...

28:08.186 --> 28:11.349
I am and always will be a person
who gets what he wants.

28:15.493 --> 28:17.154
And I still want you.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.866
You can either accept that...

28:23.401 --> 28:25.995
...or you can fight it.
Which way do you want to go?

28:28.605 --> 28:30.266
I want to be happy.

28:35.812 --> 28:36.972
Good.

28:54.197 --> 28:55.994
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

28:56.700 --> 28:59.692
I have a friend whose husband beats her up.

29:00.437 --> 29:02.871
She should come in here and file a complaint.

29:03.206 --> 29:06.767
If she has physical evidence of abuse
on her person...

29:06.943 --> 29:08.672
...we'll go out and arrest him.

29:08.745 --> 29:12.681
- If he has money, he can bail himself out.
- That's true.

29:13.050 --> 29:16.849
- Then he's free till it goes to trial.
- If it goes to trial.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.380
It's up to the city's attorney's office
whether to prosecute.

29:20.456 --> 29:21.480
Okay, so...

29:21.991 --> 29:24.755
...she comes in here, she has him arrested...

29:25.227 --> 29:27.422
...and pisses him off...

29:27.563 --> 29:31.192
...then there's no guarantee
that he won't come after her once he's out.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.063
She could get a protection order.

29:33.135 --> 29:36.468
What's that? A little piece of paper
that says he can't come around?

29:37.306 --> 29:41.037
And when he comes around,
what does she do, throw it at him?

29:41.977 --> 29:43.069
She calls us.

29:46.515 --> 29:48.745
And what about the kid? Is the...

29:49.485 --> 29:53.421
- Is the paper good for the kid, too?
- There's a child involved?

29:54.623 --> 29:56.955
That's a matter for the family courts.

29:57.026 --> 30:00.257
But unless she can prove
that he's a danger to the child...

30:00.996 --> 30:04.523
...she can't legally bar him access. Miss! Miss!

31:30.984 --> 31:33.953
- Maybe she didn't hear the signal.
- No, she heard it.

31:34.054 --> 31:35.043
No.

31:37.124 --> 31:39.115
I think maybe Teddy is right.

32:18.598 --> 32:20.657
Maybe she could still be sleeping.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.996
She's not sleeping, okay, Phil?
She's coming any second.

32:39.050 --> 32:40.813
Okay, do it again.

33:08.179 --> 33:09.339
Put her down.

33:10.515 --> 33:11.982
We should go in.

33:13.318 --> 33:15.309
It'd be crazy if we woke him up.

33:16.821 --> 33:19.756
Plus, she's going to flick the lights
if anything is wrong.

33:19.824 --> 33:21.815
- Right?
- Yeah.

33:57.294 --> 33:59.091
Another step and you're dead.

34:03.701 --> 34:05.635
Oh, my God!

34:09.639 --> 34:13.371
You don't understand.
You've broken into our house.

34:14.411 --> 34:15.672
She's alive.

34:15.746 --> 34:19.511
The lights are out. I can't see who you are.
I could kill you free and clear.

34:19.681 --> 34:20.614
Sir, please.

34:24.152 --> 34:26.621
- Where's Gracie?
- She's here.

34:26.688 --> 34:30.489
We are happy to leave, Mitch,
with Slim and Miss Gracie.

34:31.127 --> 34:35.791
And make no mistake. If you keep them here,
we will go straight to the police...

34:36.165 --> 34:40.568
...who will surely arrest you
with a great deal of pleasure.

34:43.473 --> 34:46.067
I don't want to say this in front of the group...

34:47.377 --> 34:50.244
...but you are just a rug head.

34:50.780 --> 34:54.237
If you go to the cops,
it will be her word against mine.

34:54.751 --> 34:58.915
And they will find drugs in her bureau
or her car, or whatever.

34:59.222 --> 35:02.851
Trust me on that. I'll have custody of Gracie
by the end of the week.

35:03.359 --> 35:06.953
No. Help me. I got to get her out of here.

35:07.029 --> 35:09.463
Enough with her. Get out.

35:12.300 --> 35:16.600
Wake up, baby. Wake up. Look at your papa.

35:17.239 --> 35:20.402
We're going for a little ride. Look at your papa.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.773
Help them up. Get the bag.

35:25.180 --> 35:27.671
- Look at your papa.
- I'll see you soon.

35:28.950 --> 35:30.110
'Bye, sweetie.

35:37.192 --> 35:39.456
And she's tied up because...

35:40.295 --> 35:44.391
...once a mean guy got her, tied her up...

35:44.499 --> 35:46.126
Could be a broken rib.

35:46.334 --> 35:47.961
You could play with her ears.

35:48.670 --> 35:50.194
Flicks her ears out.

35:50.405 --> 35:52.339
At least it's not my face this time.

35:53.075 --> 35:54.201
Where are we going?

35:54.276 --> 35:55.903
- Hospital.
- No.

35:57.144 --> 35:59.112
- I'm fine.
- You are not.

35:59.380 --> 36:00.847
- Where to, Phil?
- Hospital.

36:00.915 --> 36:05.579
I don't want to take her to the ER
in the middle of the night.

36:06.320 --> 36:09.585
She needs someplace safe where she can sleep.

36:09.657 --> 36:11.625
We could go to my house.

36:12.093 --> 36:14.061
No. He knows where you live.

36:15.696 --> 36:17.596
He knows where we all live.

36:18.599 --> 36:19.691
Yeah.

36:38.486 --> 36:42.513
- One queen-size bed is all right?
- Yeah, it's just me and my daughter.

36:44.892 --> 36:49.294
I'm sorry. This card has been refused.
Would you like to try another?

37:02.008 --> 37:05.944
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hiller.
The funds in your account seem to be frozen.

37:17.323 --> 37:19.814
- I love motels.
- Me, too.

37:19.993 --> 37:22.553
- Hotels, too.
- Yeah, more potato.

37:23.496 --> 37:27.125
- I'm going to bounce on the bed.
- Okay, toots. Be careful.

37:28.802 --> 37:30.565
- Hello.
- Hey, there.

37:31.938 --> 37:33.269
- Not too high.
- What?

37:33.339 --> 37:34.704
I'm talking to Gracie.

37:36.141 --> 37:38.905
We're watching some TV,
getting ready to hit the sack.

37:39.144 --> 37:40.736
Look, Mom.

37:42.748 --> 37:47.082
- What about what we talked about?
- No. No shelters.

37:48.353 --> 37:51.720
She hasn't been tainted by anything so far...

37:52.291 --> 37:56.660
...and I want to keep it that way.
- Okay. I understand.

37:56.728 --> 37:59.856
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?
- Piece of cake.

38:00.032 --> 38:01.966
Piece of pie. 'Bye.

38:05.204 --> 38:07.172
Come on, toots. Ready for bed.

38:08.106 --> 38:12.338
What's "tainted"? Is that like "painted"?

38:17.783 --> 38:22.243
- Gin, I said tomorrow, okay?
- Not exactly the Biltmore, is it?

38:24.256 --> 38:27.691
It's the information age, sweetheart.
You leave a trail everywhere.

38:27.792 --> 38:31.193
Especially when your best friend
rents your room with her credit card.

38:31.262 --> 38:34.993
I had to do that since someone froze
all my accounts, right?

38:35.333 --> 38:37.767
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.

38:38.035 --> 38:39.024
Please.

38:39.570 --> 38:42.130
If we do this the hard way,
you know who will suffer.

38:42.206 --> 38:45.175
I'm not talking about you, honey.
I mean Gracie.

38:45.343 --> 38:49.473
You don't want her touched or affected
by something bad or undesirable.

38:49.547 --> 38:52.038
- What?
- "Tainted," right?

38:58.823 --> 39:00.381
That's what tainted means.

39:11.802 --> 39:15.033
- Who's banging on the door?
- I don't know.

39:15.306 --> 39:17.000
Why? What's going on?

39:18.241 --> 39:21.438
- Mom, I'm scared.
- It will be okay, baby.

39:35.091 --> 39:36.080
Slim!

39:41.298 --> 39:42.458
Hold the bus!

39:44.034 --> 39:45.023
Hold the bus!

39:52.342 --> 39:53.809
Go, go, go!

39:56.947 --> 39:58.676
Open the door. Open it.

40:10.592 --> 40:12.082
Los Angeles-Seattle?

40:12.161 --> 40:16.860
That fare is $409 round trip.
How would you like to pay for that?

40:18.133 --> 40:19.361
Cash.

40:26.342 --> 40:30.574
I always thought in college you'd come back
here with me, but not eight years later.

40:30.646 --> 40:33.547
Well, if I had known how pretty it was...

40:33.983 --> 40:36.781
This place really sparkles!

40:36.852 --> 40:39.514
You know what they call it? The Emerald City.

40:40.356 --> 40:42.847
Isn't that where Dorothy is?

40:43.492 --> 40:46.859
No, sweetie,
that's where Dorothy goes in her dream.

40:48.497 --> 40:51.022
Where is she when she wakes up?

40:52.167 --> 40:53.657
Back in Kansas.

40:54.903 --> 40:58.235
- All right, game time. Duck your heads.
- Pigeon poop.

41:19.327 --> 41:20.954
Why did you come to me?

41:22.330 --> 41:25.128
I tried to think of the last time that I felt safe.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.459
Then I saw your face.

41:31.606 --> 41:33.506
And, I wanted a place that...

41:34.409 --> 41:36.468
...M-I-T-C-H wouldn't think of.

41:36.878 --> 41:40.109
- And someone who was stupid enough to do it.
- Yeah.

41:45.086 --> 41:47.553
- Anybody here like hot fudge sundaes?
- Yeah.

41:49.056 --> 41:50.045
I do. I do.

42:11.478 --> 42:12.467
Yeah.

42:12.979 --> 42:16.346
- FBI. Can we talk?
- Go ahead.

42:16.516 --> 42:20.077
Would you mind opening up?
I'm investigating a kidnapping.

42:20.153 --> 42:21.745
I'd like to look around.

42:26.827 --> 42:28.055
You got a warrant?

42:39.271 --> 42:42.172
- You letting us in or not?
- Hold on a second.

42:50.616 --> 42:52.049
Can I see the warrant?

43:05.965 --> 43:07.296
Watch the front.

43:10.269 --> 43:11.702
Who are you looking for?

43:28.887 --> 43:31.981
Mister, unless you leave right now,
I'm calling the police.

43:32.223 --> 43:34.657
Jeez, that's a scary thought.

43:39.164 --> 43:41.928
I married a cop.
I don't need their bullshit right now.

44:19.269 --> 44:22.033
That's enough. Do you hear me?
It's time to go. Now!

44:25.008 --> 44:27.875
You're not FBl, okay. I know who hired you.

44:29.179 --> 44:32.171
Do you know what it's like
to have a knife hit your carotid?

44:32.249 --> 44:33.341
No.

44:34.952 --> 44:37.978
Do you know what it's like to die
because you're really stupid?

44:38.055 --> 44:40.023
No, I really don't.

44:40.557 --> 44:41.581
John boy.

44:42.492 --> 44:44.551
This is not listed on the program.

44:45.195 --> 44:47.095
They're not here. Let's ride.

44:47.164 --> 44:48.426
- Can't I just...
- No!

44:49.866 --> 44:51.561
Not today.

45:01.778 --> 45:02.836
Your phone.

45:04.681 --> 45:05.978
Good night, John boy.

45:44.120 --> 45:47.021
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I needed a shave anyway.

45:47.089 --> 45:48.147
I'm sorry.

45:49.125 --> 45:51.150
- I shouldn't be here.
- Sure you should.

45:51.227 --> 45:52.091
No.

45:52.595 --> 45:57.054
- I can't keep putting people I love in danger.
- What danger? They killed my sofa.

46:05.340 --> 46:07.968
- Hello.
- Joe. This is Mitch Hiller.

46:09.077 --> 46:10.066
It's him.

46:11.212 --> 46:14.147
Hello. How are you?

46:15.016 --> 46:17.143
I assume Slim's called you?

46:18.119 --> 46:19.450
Yeah. Of course.

46:19.788 --> 46:21.585
Could you give her a message?

46:22.223 --> 46:25.090
- If she calls back again, I mean?
- I don't know.

46:25.694 --> 46:27.628
I'm on her side, not yours.

46:28.496 --> 46:29.485
Her side.

46:30.265 --> 46:32.290
What did you expect, Mitch? Really?

46:33.168 --> 46:35.227
Come on, Joe. You're a smart guy.

46:36.571 --> 46:38.562
Let me say two words to you, okay?

46:39.674 --> 46:40.470
Lug nuts.

46:41.343 --> 46:45.006
You don't want to worry they are loose
every time you pull on the freeway.

46:45.580 --> 46:48.844
How about the windows in your apartment?
Are they still locked?

46:49.350 --> 46:51.944
Person could go crazy
thinking about stuff like that.

47:00.194 --> 47:04.426
- You think those thugs are coming back?
- It doesn't make any difference.

47:04.498 --> 47:05.965
Sure it does.

47:06.600 --> 47:09.694
You don't have to go.
They're not coming back tonight.

47:10.337 --> 47:13.272
You know that it is not safe for you
if I stay here.

47:13.674 --> 47:18.202
You can come back any time.
Tomorrow, the next day.

47:21.382 --> 47:23.612
Maybe I'll take you up on that one day.

47:25.719 --> 47:28.517
Where will you go? What will you do?

47:44.437 --> 47:48.771
Jupiter, girl out there says she's your daughter.
She insists on seeing you.

47:54.414 --> 47:58.282
She can't possibly be my daughter.
I haven't had sex since 1995.

47:58.785 --> 48:00.685
Not in this country, at least.

48:01.587 --> 48:03.748
Not her. Me.

48:04.524 --> 48:06.048
I'm your daughter.

48:10.029 --> 48:13.726
- What year were you born?
- You are my father, Jupiter.

48:14.300 --> 48:18.464
I wrote you, like, 20 times.
But even when Mom died you didn't answer.

48:19.005 --> 48:23.305
- I didn't have enough money to bury her.
- Don't blame me. I didn't kill her.

48:23.976 --> 48:25.102
No. You had help.

48:26.344 --> 48:28.437
That's a stupid thing to say.

48:29.748 --> 48:31.875
What do you want? Money?

48:33.585 --> 48:35.644
I wanted Gracie to meet her grandpa.

48:38.723 --> 48:39.712
Hi.

48:44.529 --> 48:47.054
And, yes, we need money to survive.

48:48.133 --> 48:49.225
Look, sweetheart...

48:49.568 --> 48:53.504
...from 1968-1972, I had five kids. Maybe more.

48:54.406 --> 48:58.570
Half the people in that room could be my kid.
It's a running joke around here.

48:58.944 --> 49:03.244
How will you feel when you wake up one day
and find out your daughter is dead?

49:03.915 --> 49:05.780
And you didn't do anything to help?

49:08.353 --> 49:10.719
You're good. The kid's a sweet touch, too.

49:11.556 --> 49:15.390
But you're not the first to think of this gig
since that Fortune article.

49:15.794 --> 49:19.422
So I'll give you the same thing
I gave the other three.

49:19.597 --> 49:24.159
$6. Enough to buy a sandwich.
But for you, I'll make it $12.

49:25.803 --> 49:27.998
Make sure you buy the kid a sandwich, too.

49:30.574 --> 49:34.169
I believe this originally belonged to you.

49:34.979 --> 49:38.471
Pawn it, since you're so hard up.
I'm sure it's worth more than $12.

50:05.142 --> 50:07.371
Mommy, don't cry.

50:08.444 --> 50:09.775
Please don't cry.

50:37.307 --> 50:38.638
Mommy!

50:51.454 --> 50:52.785
This way.

51:08.670 --> 51:11.298
I'm sorry. This is the best we can do.

51:11.473 --> 51:13.941
It's okay. We're fine. Thanks.

51:15.077 --> 51:16.977
Who are all these people?

51:20.649 --> 51:23.812
They're kind of friends of friends of Phil.

51:34.563 --> 51:36.224
What is it?

51:38.066 --> 51:39.897
It's food, okay?

51:58.052 --> 52:00.520
Hi, I lost my birth certificate.

52:17.104 --> 52:19.334
This is for you. Phil sent it.

52:20.708 --> 52:22.903
Are you surprised?

52:23.844 --> 52:26.472
Sure, we take care of you. All right?

52:28.282 --> 52:29.579
Dear Slim:

52:30.451 --> 52:34.251
Yesterday three men threatened to kill me
if I helped you in any way.

52:35.022 --> 52:38.354
Fortunately for you, this aroused my interest.

52:38.792 --> 52:40.157
But she may also be...

52:40.226 --> 52:43.593
I'm sending this to an old address,
the diner where you worked.

52:43.963 --> 52:46.693
If this reaches you and you need more...

52:46.933 --> 52:50.232
...leave word at my office. Jupiter.

53:39.418 --> 53:42.216
What do we think? We like it here?

53:42.821 --> 53:46.882
- Why? Are we moving again?
- No. We just...

53:47.025 --> 53:48.151
Good.

53:48.227 --> 53:52.357
Because I'm sick and tired to death of moving.

53:53.732 --> 53:55.597
Me, too. So here's the deal.

53:55.667 --> 54:00.297
You can call me Mom or you can call me Erin,
but you cannot call me Slim.

54:01.173 --> 54:03.164
I never call you Slim.

54:03.475 --> 54:06.239
I know, but just in case
somebody asks you someday...

54:06.345 --> 54:08.313
I don't think you are that slim.

54:09.548 --> 54:10.845
Thanks a lot.

54:13.752 --> 54:17.949
- Do I get a new name, too?
- I guess. If you want one.

54:19.123 --> 54:20.420
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

54:20.691 --> 54:22.852
- Hi. Betty?
- Yes?

54:23.261 --> 54:26.719
- I'm Erin Shleeter. I called you.
- Yes, I remember.

54:26.798 --> 54:28.425
This is my daughter.

54:29.367 --> 54:32.564
Look at you. You are so... What's your name?

54:33.037 --> 54:34.368
Queen Elizabeth.

54:36.207 --> 54:39.870
Welcome, Queen Elizabeth.
You'll have a good time here.

54:39.944 --> 54:41.741
May I call you "Queen" for short?

54:43.781 --> 54:47.615
I like talking to Grandma, but every Sunday...

54:48.019 --> 54:51.785
...do we have to drive for 55 hours...

54:52.089 --> 54:54.853
...just to reach some phone booth?

54:56.060 --> 54:59.120
- Can I call Daddy this time?
- No.

54:59.197 --> 55:02.064
Please? Please?

55:02.333 --> 55:04.062
Don't beg. You look like a dog.

55:09.039 --> 55:12.338
You know he has friends
in the police department...

55:12.409 --> 55:16.675
...and you're depriving him of his rights
as a father, nonsense like that.

55:16.847 --> 55:19.441
It's leading up to a big custody hearing.

55:19.516 --> 55:20.915
What are you saying?

55:20.984 --> 55:25.080
Talk to him. Calm him down.
Call him before he does something stupid.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.783
It might help if he talked to Gracie...

55:28.291 --> 55:33.194
...for her sake, too.
It's not healthy to be without a father.

55:34.464 --> 55:37.160
We better keep this short. I'll call you next week.

55:37.234 --> 55:39.600
Wait. I want to speak to Gracie...

55:48.879 --> 55:52.280
Hi, Daddy. We're having a great vacation.

55:52.582 --> 55:53.571
Where?

55:53.783 --> 55:57.274
We've been everywhere. Chicago and...

55:57.686 --> 56:00.154
No questions, okay? Or it ends now.

56:01.490 --> 56:05.756
Listen, bitch. She's my daughter, too.
Don't tell me how I can talk to her.

56:06.095 --> 56:09.758
Put me back on the phone with Gracie.
Give her the damn phone.

56:10.132 --> 56:12.794
Tell Daddy that you love him and say goodbye.

56:15.204 --> 56:18.367
Gracie, you there, honey? Sweetheart, talk to me.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.372
'Bye, Daddy.

56:19.441 --> 56:22.774
Honey, I'm sorry, baby.
Daddy didn't mean to use bad words.

56:22.912 --> 56:25.107
- I'm really, really sad.
- Graciel

56:29.551 --> 56:32.042
I'm sorry, kid. It was my mistake.

56:35.958 --> 56:37.823
Mommy's just a big dummy.

56:43.899 --> 56:45.127
What do you think?

56:48.303 --> 56:51.431
- Her voice?
- Yeah, she sounds the same.

56:51.572 --> 56:54.700
Good. Because if she's changed her appearance...

56:54.776 --> 56:56.209
Thanks, John.

56:58.880 --> 57:02.179
I remember her. I told you.
The diner. The scam.

57:02.817 --> 57:06.309
I don't remember why you broke the rules
and decided to marry the bitch.

57:06.587 --> 57:08.145
She's not a bitch.

57:09.190 --> 57:10.316
Sorry.

57:12.193 --> 57:13.683
She is a waitress.

57:15.330 --> 57:17.764
- What does that mean?
- Means she's stupid.

57:18.566 --> 57:21.558
- Call your mother. Now to call you.
- She's not stupid.

57:21.636 --> 57:25.436
She thinks if the calls are short
they can't be traced.

57:25.506 --> 57:29.670
I still want to know.
With all the girls that we pulled that on, why her?

57:30.678 --> 57:32.009
Maybe it's love.

57:33.114 --> 57:34.046
Yeah.

57:34.115 --> 57:38.278
I know what that means.
If you were smart, you'd forget her.

57:38.418 --> 57:42.115
I can't simply forget her. She kidnapped my kid.

57:42.656 --> 57:46.490
How many times do I have to go there?
It's not kidnapping.

57:47.527 --> 57:50.621
Kidnapping is when someone
who isn't the mother takes the kid.

57:50.697 --> 57:53.325
When the mother takes the kid,
it's called parenting.

57:53.467 --> 57:55.094
How soon can you get there?

57:56.303 --> 58:00.000
I don't know.
You know, I could lose my job for this.

58:00.374 --> 58:01.363
Robbie...

58:02.476 --> 58:06.936
...you could lose your job for all the jobs
you're doing besides doing your job.

58:07.481 --> 58:09.972
- You know what I mean?
- You got to be reasonable.

58:13.854 --> 58:17.017
- I know some guys in Detroit.
- Like your guys in Seattle?

58:17.324 --> 58:19.519
I don't think so. I know what they're like.

58:19.693 --> 58:21.888
They've never met her, never heard her voice.

58:22.329 --> 58:24.854
She'll spot them and run
before they even see her.

58:26.665 --> 58:28.098
It's you, Robbie.

58:29.168 --> 58:30.135
It's you...

58:31.237 --> 58:32.568
...or it's you.

58:37.109 --> 58:39.543
What do you think? Is it okay?

58:39.712 --> 58:40.872
It's okay, right?

58:42.948 --> 58:44.677
No, it's not. It's horrible.

58:45.284 --> 58:47.514
It's not horrible, Mom.

58:47.686 --> 58:50.280
Yeah, but it's not good, is it?

58:50.489 --> 58:53.014
Mom, you tasted it.

59:15.414 --> 59:17.347
You know what I think?

59:20.618 --> 59:21.949
No, what's that?

59:22.454 --> 59:24.718
I think you miss Daddy.

59:27.692 --> 59:29.387
Daddy yells at me, toots.

59:29.994 --> 59:32.588
Well, you miss somebody.

59:48.446 --> 59:49.811
There he is.

59:50.815 --> 59:52.339
Joe! Joe!

59:52.584 --> 59:53.812
- Joe!
- Joe!

59:55.186 --> 59:57.484
Joe! Joe, over here!

59:59.524 --> 01:00:01.924
Hey! How are you?

01:00:06.063 --> 01:00:10.056
You're lucky I like you.
This is the most preposterous trip I've ever taken.

01:00:10.501 --> 01:00:12.560
Change your plane. Rent a car.

01:00:16.173 --> 01:00:17.162
Let's do it.

01:00:35.859 --> 01:00:38.123
You guys hungry as I am?

01:00:55.212 --> 01:00:57.543
- Seems like she's doing great.
- Yeah.

01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:00.039
How about you? You okay?

01:01:00.383 --> 01:01:03.045
Cut off from everybody,
can't talk to your friends...

01:01:03.853 --> 01:01:05.081
Gracie is safe.

01:01:07.323 --> 01:01:08.585
So Mitch is...

01:01:10.259 --> 01:01:13.126
- When is this custody thing?
- Couple of months.

01:01:14.897 --> 01:01:16.888
Anyway, they favor the mother, so...

01:01:18.601 --> 01:01:19.932
Yeah, they do.

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:23.767
But he has a lot of money, and a lot of lawyers.

01:01:24.507 --> 01:01:28.443
That's kind of what I mean.
I mean, you can't run forever, Slim.

01:01:30.046 --> 01:01:31.775
Why not? I'm good at it.

01:01:32.014 --> 01:01:35.950
You are. But, then again,
you're good at everything.

01:01:44.327 --> 01:01:49.059
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you criticizing me or flirting with me?

01:01:49.764 --> 01:01:51.561
Let me get back to you on that.

01:01:53.201 --> 01:01:56.693
- Hi, Gracie. Is that your ball?
- Yes.

01:01:59.741 --> 01:02:01.265
You want to see a trick?

01:02:02.611 --> 01:02:03.737
Yeah.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.842
I don't hear the basketball. Do you?

01:02:10.385 --> 01:02:11.682
She was just...

01:02:12.654 --> 01:02:13.643
Gracie!

01:02:15.824 --> 01:02:16.813
Gracie!

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:20.892
Gracie! I mean, Queen!

01:02:21.396 --> 01:02:24.331
Mommy! Mommy! Watch my new trick!

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.428
Didn't I tell you to stay close?

01:02:31.673 --> 01:02:32.662
Come on.

01:02:59.833 --> 01:03:01.767
Do you remember the house rules?

01:03:03.971 --> 01:03:06.462
Who can forget, with Gracie here?

01:03:18.519 --> 01:03:19.508
Joe.

01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:24.988
- What would have happened if we...
- Don't.

01:03:27.427 --> 01:03:29.088
It's wrong to think like that.

01:03:30.263 --> 01:03:32.424
- Why?
- Because of Gracie.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.891
She's truly a great kid.

01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:39.329
Any path that doesn't include her
doesn't make any sense.

01:03:41.274 --> 01:03:43.606
Ginny told me about that weekend.

01:03:45.445 --> 01:03:47.140
Of your wedding?

01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:51.574
Did she tell you how terrible I was?

01:03:51.718 --> 01:03:56.348
Joe, that might work with other people,
but you forget. I've had you.

01:03:58.324 --> 01:03:59.951
I didn't forget.

01:04:01.327 --> 01:04:04.660
And I'm telling you from experience...

01:04:06.099 --> 01:04:07.532
...you're not that bad.

01:04:12.772 --> 01:04:15.707
- Do you have to go tomorrow?
- Yeah.

01:04:16.408 --> 01:04:20.344
Why? Why can't you quit your job
and come here...

01:04:20.846 --> 01:04:24.373
...and play the horses,
and become independently wealthy?

01:04:26.785 --> 01:04:28.514
Please, kiss me, Slim.

01:04:28.887 --> 01:04:31.583
I know we're not supposed to,
and it's against house rules.

01:04:31.656 --> 01:04:34.955
But for me to come all this way
and feel the way I do...

01:04:59.384 --> 01:05:01.215
You're a great person, Slim.

01:05:02.621 --> 01:05:04.987
You're a great person. Just like your daughter.

01:05:26.844 --> 01:05:28.573
Can I get a chocolate kiss?

01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:33.383
- Who wants to put two eggs in.
- I want to put the eggs.

01:05:34.718 --> 01:05:35.480
Careful.

01:08:30.624 --> 01:08:32.285
I want you back.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:34.515
No.

01:08:34.594 --> 01:08:36.720
- It could be just like it was.
- No!

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.232
That's pretty stupid. You know why?

01:08:43.737 --> 01:08:46.035
Because if I can't have you, nobody will.

01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:52.870
Like that jerk who was here with you.
He'll be fishing for his guts.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.549
You know what else?
For murder, they need a body.

01:08:57.017 --> 01:08:59.451
Otherwise, they'll think you ran away again.

01:09:00.252 --> 01:09:02.345
Only this time, you'll never come back.

01:09:04.658 --> 01:09:05.647
Mommy!

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:08.589
Daddy, no!

01:09:08.795 --> 01:09:10.729
Stop, Daddy! Stop it!

01:09:11.296 --> 01:09:12.286
Mommy!

01:09:12.499 --> 01:09:14.466
Stop, Daddy! Stop!

01:09:38.791 --> 01:09:42.727
Go on, honey. Get in your seat.
Get in the back. Strap yourself in.

01:10:15.593 --> 01:10:16.617
Put that on.

01:10:17.328 --> 01:10:18.852
Mommy, what's happening?

01:10:20.031 --> 01:10:22.158
Put it on. Put these on, too.

01:10:27.805 --> 01:10:28.567
You.

01:10:43.287 --> 01:10:44.447
Car seat, honey.

01:10:45.123 --> 01:10:48.217
- Then slow so I can.
- I can't slow down right now.

01:11:33.436 --> 01:11:34.198
Bitch!

01:11:46.482 --> 01:11:47.414
Pull over.

01:11:48.584 --> 01:11:50.211
Pull the car over!

01:11:50.786 --> 01:11:52.276
Mommy, stop it!

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:54.015
Hold on tight.

01:11:57.459 --> 01:11:58.483
Pull over.

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:04.492
Shit!

01:12:11.106 --> 01:12:12.095
Come on.

01:12:14.543 --> 01:12:17.011
- Mommy!
- Hold on, Gracie, okay.

01:12:20.916 --> 01:12:21.905
Mommy!

01:12:28.858 --> 01:12:29.586
Come on!

01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:36.254
It will be over soon. We're almost there!
Just hold on, okay?

01:13:42.195 --> 01:13:45.528
You'll be all right, okay? All right.

01:14:16.562 --> 01:14:17.859
Okay, toots.

01:14:18.864 --> 01:14:20.058
Let's talk.

01:14:23.536 --> 01:14:25.663
You want me to tell you what happened?

01:14:27.073 --> 01:14:28.267
Fair enough.

01:14:28.975 --> 01:14:30.340
First thing...

01:14:31.711 --> 01:14:33.076
...Erin is over.

01:14:33.846 --> 01:14:35.279
I liked Erin.

01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:39.083
And you are not the Queen of England anymore.

01:14:40.619 --> 01:14:41.779
Okay?

01:14:48.561 --> 01:14:49.892
I'm hungry.

01:15:01.707 --> 01:15:04.107
- Is everything okay here?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:15:05.077 --> 01:15:07.601
Hey there, little cutie. What's your name?

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.642
I don't know.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.954
Hey, Millie, 14 needs menus.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.194
Come on.

01:15:31.336 --> 01:15:35.397
You'll be okay? You're going to sit here,
be Mommy's good girl? Okay?

01:15:35.907 --> 01:15:39.070
All right. Don't talk to any strangers.
Be right back.

01:15:41.279 --> 01:15:43.474
- Is Mr. Toller with someone?
- No, but...

01:15:43.548 --> 01:15:46.210
Good. I'm not a crazy person. I swear.

01:15:46.284 --> 01:15:48.775
- Wait a minute. You can't...
- Don't call security.

01:15:48.853 --> 01:15:52.482
Hi, Mr. Toller. My name is Erin...
I mean, my name is Slim.

01:15:52.557 --> 01:15:56.959
I got your name from Millie.
Down at the diner, right down the block.

01:15:57.528 --> 01:15:59.086
The thing is...

01:15:59.696 --> 01:16:02.995
My husband keeps trying to kill me.
You know? See?

01:16:03.133 --> 01:16:06.227
I need someone to talk to who is smart.

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:09.735
And I have money, you know.

01:16:10.674 --> 01:16:13.438
I have money. $500.

01:16:14.912 --> 01:16:18.177
And you can have it. You can have it all...

01:16:18.549 --> 01:16:20.710
...if you just listen to what...

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.108
Two minutes.

01:16:25.089 --> 01:16:26.351
Please.

01:16:34.865 --> 01:16:36.162
Thanks.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.092
Small person. Can you watch her? Thank you.

01:16:44.174 --> 01:16:45.868
Pardon my French, dear, but...

01:16:46.576 --> 01:16:50.569
...I hope you got some pleasure from it
because you've really screwed yourself.

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.907
You had two chances to go to the police,
file a complaint...

01:16:54.984 --> 01:16:56.975
...put his violence on record.

01:16:57.587 --> 01:16:58.952
You ignored them both.

01:16:59.755 --> 01:17:02.588
Which tells him to keep on coming
until he kills you.

01:17:03.926 --> 01:17:07.384
As for Gracie,
you're going to the custody hearing?

01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:08.526
Yes, sir.

01:17:08.764 --> 01:17:12.632
If you didn't, the judge would rule against you,
and you'd become a fugitive.

01:17:13.402 --> 01:17:17.964
Once you're there, your husband will,
as you say, portray you as a drug addict.

01:17:19.108 --> 01:17:22.441
For all I know, you are one.
You break in here uninvited.

01:17:23.279 --> 01:17:28.012
I'd say your attacker has a very good chance
of gaining sole custody.

01:17:28.885 --> 01:17:31.854
- If you don't mind, put this away.
- No, no. Take it.

01:17:32.355 --> 01:17:33.947
Is that it?

01:17:37.392 --> 01:17:38.723
You won't help me?

01:17:39.561 --> 01:17:41.495
That's what I'm telling you.

01:17:42.397 --> 01:17:43.523
It's too late.

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:50.904
There isn't anybody who can help you.

01:17:55.644 --> 01:17:58.169
In good conscience, I should say...

01:17:58.246 --> 01:18:00.544
...the custody hearing is probably a trick.

01:18:01.416 --> 01:18:04.442
It's not about itself. It's a way to find you.

01:18:05.387 --> 01:18:10.017
A way to get you in a particular place and time
so his men can follow you...

01:18:10.192 --> 01:18:13.059
...and he can come to wherever you are...

01:18:14.796 --> 01:18:16.229
...and kill you.

01:18:24.005 --> 01:18:25.131
Okay.

01:18:32.646 --> 01:18:34.876
Now I got to make you a promise, Grace.

01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:38.675
Ever since you were born...

01:18:39.887 --> 01:18:44.290
One day I started thinking
of all the awful things that could happen.

01:18:45.826 --> 01:18:49.262
People who you'd love would die...

01:18:50.898 --> 01:18:53.264
...or leave you, or betray you...

01:18:55.536 --> 01:18:57.060
...and break your heart.

01:18:57.705 --> 01:19:00.367
Or a guy would hurt you in some way.

01:19:00.841 --> 01:19:03.207
And I thought to myself, if I could...

01:19:03.978 --> 01:19:06.708
...protect you from that, even once.

01:19:09.416 --> 01:19:10.849
If I could just...

01:19:12.386 --> 01:19:14.547
...absorb any of that myself.

01:19:29.769 --> 01:19:31.066
Here goes.

01:19:35.775 --> 01:19:39.302
Okay, you guys, keep up with me.
This is really busy here.

01:19:40.346 --> 01:19:42.473
Would you hold her hand, please?

01:19:44.284 --> 01:19:47.014
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.

01:19:47.186 --> 01:19:51.350
- Oh, yeah? How about Horace?
- Okay, the second most.

01:19:51.891 --> 01:19:54.826
Rent a car, drive to Reno, then fly to San Jose.

01:19:55.862 --> 01:19:58.490
- Are you out of your mind?
- You noticed?

01:20:16.214 --> 01:20:17.203
Oh, my!

01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:21.651
What happened?
I thought I'm supposed to drive to Reno.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.779
I had to make sure you weren't followed.

01:20:24.856 --> 01:20:26.118
Okay.

01:20:26.892 --> 01:20:29.292
Hey, Graceland. How are you?

01:20:31.563 --> 01:20:33.292
Hey, Gracie! Over here!

01:20:37.336 --> 01:20:39.201
- Here are the tickets.
- Okay.

01:20:39.404 --> 01:20:42.464
Some cash and credit cards. It's on me.

01:20:43.141 --> 01:20:46.702
- Just don't call home. Or Phil's.
- Okay.

01:20:47.779 --> 01:20:50.646
Think of it as a paid vacation you never had.

01:20:54.219 --> 01:20:55.651
Hey, toots.

01:20:55.953 --> 01:20:57.580
You want to give Mommy a hug?

01:20:58.789 --> 01:21:00.017
Come here.

01:21:02.259 --> 01:21:04.420
Say goodbye to me. Okay?

01:21:06.197 --> 01:21:09.132
I'm going to miss you. It's just for a little while.

01:21:11.335 --> 01:21:12.495
A little kiss?

01:21:13.838 --> 01:21:15.931
Can I have a little smile before you go?

01:21:19.377 --> 01:21:20.366
Okay.

01:21:28.586 --> 01:21:30.884
Sweetie, why don't you sit up front, okay?

01:21:34.558 --> 01:21:36.025
Take care of her.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:37.750
Oh, honey.

01:21:40.231 --> 01:21:42.665
I don't want you to worry, okay?

01:21:42.733 --> 01:21:46.498
Eric will have her dribbling behind her back
the next time you see her.

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:51.101
Thanks. I'm number 1 on the auto dialer.

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.536
Call me, or I'll call you.

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:56.674
All calls, 15 seconds or less.

01:21:59.082 --> 01:22:01.243
- Cake?
- Pie.

01:22:04.454 --> 01:22:05.978
Try to have fun.

01:22:07.257 --> 01:22:08.724
Hey, how long?

01:22:08.792 --> 01:22:11.488
The custody hearing is in the next month, so...

01:22:12.128 --> 01:22:14.619
- That's my deadline.
- Deadline for what?

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:32.871
Relax. Close your eyes.

01:22:34.184 --> 01:22:37.152
I'm not here. He's not here.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:41.650
Time!

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:44.890
Relax. Breathe. Close your eyes.

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:48.025
Close your eyes. That's it. Go!

01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:53.825
Relax. Keep your balance.

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.063
- You ready?
- Yes.

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:57.899
You sure?

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:03.404
- Can you lose?
- No.

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:06.871
- Can he hurt you?
- No.

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.183
- Even though he's bigger?
- He's a lot bigger.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:13.911
- Even though he's stronger?
- He's a lot stronger.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:20.052
Get some rest tonight.
Tomorrow we're gonna work on the ball.

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:26.190
Look at me!

01:23:27.768 --> 01:23:29.429
- If he hits you...
- No way.

01:23:29.937 --> 01:23:30.961
Say it.

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:34.906
It takes twice as much energy
to swing and miss as to swing and hit.

01:23:36.043 --> 01:23:39.604
You think you're done for.
He's got you by the throat. Left arm up.

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:44.145
Good. Rotate around. Drop that arm.
Reach up, grab my hand.

01:23:44.218 --> 01:23:45.651
There. Good.

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.185
So how do you win?

01:23:52.393 --> 01:23:53.519
How?

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:56.228
I attack.

01:23:56.597 --> 01:24:00.226
- And what do you do after you attack?
- Nothing.

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:02.399
Why nothing?

01:24:03.237 --> 01:24:05.398
Because I never stop attacking.

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:10.369
Good! Do it!

01:24:10.444 --> 01:24:12.742
Use your legs. Keep that chin down!

01:24:13.447 --> 01:24:16.210
That's it! Go! Go!

01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:20.984
One last thing.

01:24:22.589 --> 01:24:24.181
The hardest lesson.

01:24:25.325 --> 01:24:27.725
We can't control the universe.

01:24:29.963 --> 01:24:31.453
Suddenly the maid enters.

01:24:31.531 --> 01:24:34.591
You're distracted for an instant and he hits you.

01:24:35.201 --> 01:24:36.634
That's not possible.

01:24:37.437 --> 01:24:41.396
To win, we must prepare,
even for the impossible.

01:24:42.542 --> 01:24:46.137
We bend the universe to our will,
but it will only go so far.

01:24:49.816 --> 01:24:51.807
- So you're saying...
- Yes.

01:24:57.123 --> 01:24:58.385
You're down.

01:24:59.492 --> 01:25:00.720
Lying there.

01:25:01.628 --> 01:25:03.095
Seemingly beaten.

01:25:06.832 --> 01:25:07.992
But hear me.

01:25:09.401 --> 01:25:10.800
Hold on to my voice.

01:25:12.972 --> 01:25:14.496
He's standing over you.

01:25:16.175 --> 01:25:17.699
He thinks he's won.

01:25:19.144 --> 01:25:22.671
And as sure as he's a coward,
he will try to kick you.

01:25:23.215 --> 01:25:24.341
Yes.

01:25:25.284 --> 01:25:27.479
But because you know what he'll do...

01:25:28.687 --> 01:25:30.848
...you're smiling inside.

01:25:38.864 --> 01:25:41.560
- How's that guy I set you up with?
- He's good.

01:25:42.368 --> 01:25:45.030
- He teach you how to think?
- I hope so.

01:25:46.872 --> 01:25:48.362
Did you find Mitch?

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.500
He sold the house.
Bought a place out near the marina.

01:25:51.944 --> 01:25:55.845
I need a woman who looks like me.
5'5", 115 pounds.

01:25:55.913 --> 01:25:59.849
An off-duty cop or something.
She should have her hair cut short, too.

01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:02.943
- She should wear jeans and sneakers.
- Here's his address.

01:26:03.021 --> 01:26:05.489
I got her a room at the Washington Square Inn.

01:26:06.024 --> 01:26:07.116
What's she for?

01:26:07.191 --> 01:26:09.819
I need Mitch to think I'm here, in San Francisco.

01:26:10.361 --> 01:26:13.387
Have her meet me, 5:45,
top floor of the Vesuvio's.

01:26:13.631 --> 01:26:17.465
Today? Well, that's awful short notice.
I don't know...

01:26:17.535 --> 01:26:22.472
I thought Jupiter was almighty,
powerful, king of the gods.

01:26:25.977 --> 01:26:27.968
Yeah. One more thing.

01:26:28.546 --> 01:26:31.606
At some point,
not right now because it would be phony...

01:26:31.716 --> 01:26:33.877
...I need you to acknowledge I'm your kid.

01:26:44.362 --> 01:26:46.829
- You sure this will work?
- You bet your life.

01:26:49.132 --> 01:26:51.100
Thanks. I will.

01:26:52.369 --> 01:26:56.203
- And where is Gracie?
- Well, she gets back the day after tomorrow.

01:26:56.373 --> 01:26:58.238
And then we're gonna fly to LA.

01:26:58.408 --> 01:27:02.174
Tell me something, please.
Why is this call different?

01:27:02.345 --> 01:27:05.712
Well, you know, we were in the country then.

01:27:05.782 --> 01:27:08.774
Now we're in the city, meeting with my lawyers.

01:27:08.852 --> 01:27:11.343
So, you know, there's lots of cell phones here.

01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:15.488
So, there's no way they can trace this.

01:27:16.026 --> 01:27:18.324
Make sure you call me the minute you get back.

01:27:18.395 --> 01:27:20.454
I can't wait to see my girls, okay?

01:27:21.364 --> 01:27:23.355
Hey, give me the ball, man!

01:30:54.273 --> 01:30:58.174
- Coffee?
- No, I got to get home. Change for work.

01:30:59.311 --> 01:31:00.505
I'll call you.

01:31:02.447 --> 01:31:03.812
You want my number?

01:31:05.016 --> 01:31:06.176
Sure.

01:31:08.453 --> 01:31:11.286
- Thanks, for everything.
- You, too.

01:31:14.192 --> 01:31:15.853
I really appreciate it.

01:31:18.897 --> 01:31:19.989
Really.

01:31:27.105 --> 01:31:29.266
Lucy. Hey, baby.

01:31:31.142 --> 01:31:32.734
No, I had to work late.

01:31:36.982 --> 01:31:40.782
Tonight's no good. I have a flight
to San Francisco early tomorrow morning.

01:31:41.353 --> 01:31:43.719
If it was pleasure, you'd be going, too.

01:31:44.356 --> 01:31:47.085
No, I have to go up and pick up my daughter.

01:31:48.425 --> 01:31:50.655
Yeah, the custody hearing is down here.

01:31:50.995 --> 01:31:54.522
But it looks as if Gracie
is being taken to San Francisco...

01:31:55.666 --> 01:31:56.860
...and my wife...

01:31:56.934 --> 01:32:01.394
...it seems as if she has completely vanished.
Right off the face of the earth.

01:32:02.806 --> 01:32:05.001
I doubt they'll ever find her this time.

01:32:06.744 --> 01:32:10.976
I want her to meet you, too.
We'll call you as soon as we get back.

01:32:11.749 --> 01:32:13.114
Love you. 'Bye.

01:34:44.832 --> 01:34:47.357
- Hi. What's up?
- I'm in.

01:35:42.455 --> 01:35:45.049
Thanks for letting me come talk about Gracie.

01:35:45.391 --> 01:35:47.723
I'm glad you're willing to admit your temper.

01:35:47.994 --> 01:35:51.657
And let's not mince words.
The physical abuse you subjected me to.

01:35:52.198 --> 01:35:55.724
Perhaps with your new attitude,
we can really work something out.

01:35:56.368 --> 01:35:59.360
Per your last letter, I'll see you the evening of...

01:36:59.297 --> 01:37:01.458
Hey. You okay?

01:37:03.301 --> 01:37:04.290
Say it again.

01:37:05.136 --> 01:37:06.068
Say what?

01:37:06.804 --> 01:37:08.328
You know, what you told me.

01:37:09.707 --> 01:37:12.232
You have a divine, animal right...

01:37:12.543 --> 01:37:15.569
...to protect your own life
and the life of your offspring.

01:37:21.519 --> 01:37:22.781
Are you still there?

01:37:23.854 --> 01:37:24.843
Yeah.

01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:28.788
Stay on the line. I want to see if this works.

01:39:38.386 --> 01:39:39.683
It's me.

01:39:47.995 --> 01:39:48.984
Yeah.

01:39:50.264 --> 01:39:51.697
And this morning?

01:39:51.799 --> 01:39:54.359
You always did forget to turn off the coffee.

01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:08.411
I found it, Mitch.

01:40:44.217 --> 01:40:46.549
It's a machine. It knocks out cell phones.

01:41:03.135 --> 01:41:05.000
Found that gun, too.

01:41:07.573 --> 01:41:09.473
- Scared?
- Of what?

01:41:10.643 --> 01:41:12.634
Now is when you decide, Mitch.

01:41:13.879 --> 01:41:17.110
Whether you're a coward or not.
If you are, you can run.

01:41:17.449 --> 01:41:18.677
Go ahead, run.

01:41:18.817 --> 01:41:20.910
You will shoot me with my own gun?

01:41:21.687 --> 01:41:23.211
I threw them away.

01:41:25.257 --> 01:41:27.350
Then someone else is here with you.

01:41:29.361 --> 01:41:30.487
No.

01:41:32.398 --> 01:41:33.831
You're alone.

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:35.762
Why not?

01:41:44.977 --> 01:41:46.944
This is what you wanted, right?

01:41:48.613 --> 01:41:50.979
What you were going to San Francisco for?

01:41:51.683 --> 01:41:53.275
The chance to get me alone?

01:41:53.952 --> 01:41:55.112
Yeah.

01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:57.612
But what are you doing?

01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:04.728
You want to fight me? Man to man?

01:42:06.064 --> 01:42:07.554
Woman, Mitch.

01:42:09.467 --> 01:42:11.958
Yeah, that's what I mean. Man against woman.

01:42:14.472 --> 01:42:16.406
You sure that's fair?

01:42:18.176 --> 01:42:19.438
Fair to whom?

01:42:22.313 --> 01:42:26.010
- No, I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- Can't do what?

01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:27.979
This. It's ridiculous.

01:42:28.886 --> 01:42:32.447
You could hit me before, though, couldn't you?
When I was defenseless.

01:42:36.927 --> 01:42:38.292
That's not going to...

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.795
As I was saying, that's not going to do anything.

01:42:47.204 --> 01:42:48.671
Then what will do it?

01:42:48.939 --> 01:42:52.602
Are you such a coward that you can only hit me
when I'm not expecting it?

01:43:12.763 --> 01:43:13.525
Come on.

01:43:13.597 --> 01:43:16.191
I don't understand, Slim.
How does this work for you?

01:43:18.568 --> 01:43:20.729
I mean, this is carefully thought out.

01:43:21.471 --> 01:43:25.770
But say you do succeed. You beat me up
or whatever. You won't murder me.

01:43:29.912 --> 01:43:33.245
So all you've done is further piss me off.

01:43:40.489 --> 01:43:42.980
Self-defense is not murder.

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.621
You don't have the guts.

01:43:53.102 --> 01:43:54.091
Come on.

01:43:54.637 --> 01:43:57.504
It's not self-defense
when you break in here and attack me.

01:43:57.573 --> 01:44:00.804
Attack you?
All I did was slap you around a little bit.

01:44:03.412 --> 01:44:06.609
You really think you're going to kill me
and get away with it?

01:44:10.586 --> 01:44:13.020
I told you. Self-defense.

01:44:14.056 --> 01:44:17.183
As arranged in our letters,
I'm here to talk about Gracie.

01:44:17.726 --> 01:44:19.159
There are no letters.

01:44:19.227 --> 01:44:21.889
Sure there are.
In the drawer where your pistol was.

01:44:26.334 --> 01:44:28.529
You just put your prints all over them.

01:44:29.037 --> 01:44:31.733
You attacked me, I fought back.

01:44:32.941 --> 01:44:34.704
If something should happen...

01:44:41.216 --> 01:44:44.947
I don't care how long it takes.
I only have to hit you once.

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:48.521
Just one good hit and it's over.

01:45:00.602 --> 01:45:01.591
He bleeds.

01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:03.601
You can count on one thing, baby.

01:45:03.705 --> 01:45:07.003
Even if I don't kill you,
you'll never see Gracie again.

01:45:07.441 --> 01:45:08.669
You never will.

01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:29.322
I'm confused, Mitch. Aren't you a man?

01:45:30.697 --> 01:45:32.494
Can't you hit me again, even once?

01:45:49.616 --> 01:45:51.140
What do you think now?

01:45:51.585 --> 01:45:55.645
All your training, all your practice...
It's over, baby.

01:45:55.888 --> 01:45:56.786
It's over.

01:46:47.305 --> 01:46:49.239
- Hi.
- I can't do it, Gin.

01:46:49.374 --> 01:46:51.274
What do you mean? What happened?

01:46:52.177 --> 01:46:53.337
I can't do it.

01:46:53.645 --> 01:46:55.875
He'll come after you and after Gracie.

01:46:55.947 --> 01:46:59.178
I know all that, but I can't do it.

01:47:00.218 --> 01:47:02.413
I'm not a killer, Gin.

01:47:02.888 --> 01:47:05.857
I'm not him. I can't do this.

01:47:07.626 --> 01:47:11.289
Hello? Slim, are you there?
Should I call the cops?

01:47:11.596 --> 01:47:13.928
Slim, answer me! Slim.

01:47:16.067 --> 01:47:17.932
Hold on to my voice.

01:47:18.670 --> 01:47:20.331
He thinks he's won.

01:47:21.139 --> 01:47:24.666
And as sure as he's a coward,
he will try to kick you.

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.487
Some woman called. Ginny?

01:48:55.932 --> 01:48:57.229
He's still in there?

01:48:59.235 --> 01:49:00.532
Armed?

01:49:01.604 --> 01:49:03.003
Dangerous?

01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:16.644
Looks like you're one of the lucky ones.

01:50:02.831 --> 01:50:03.820
Gracie!

01:50:06.267 --> 01:50:07.564
Mommy!

01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:16.471
My baby!

01:50:16.544 --> 01:50:19.035
Where are we going now, Mommy?

01:50:19.246 --> 01:50:20.679
Anywhere you want to go.

01:50:20.748 --> 01:50:22.443
Emerald City.

01:50:23.417 --> 01:50:25.612
I was thinking the same thing.

01:50:27.121 --> 01:50:31.558
- I have something to show you, Mommy.
- You do? Show me.

01:50:33.661 --> 01:50:35.720
Something for you.

01:50:40.234 --> 01:50:42.896
Oh, my goodness. Look at all this.

01:50:43.838 --> 01:50:45.829
Where did you get all this stuff?

01:50:47.875 --> 01:50:49.467
From Hawaii.
