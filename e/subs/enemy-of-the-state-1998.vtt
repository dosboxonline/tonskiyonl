00:48.840 --> 00:49.757
Come on.

00:52.134 --> 00:54.136
Come on, mutt.
Now, look at that ball. All right.

00:54.303 --> 00:56.514
Come on. Get that ball. Ah-

00:56.681 --> 00:59.350
There's no problem with that.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.602
Oh, God damn it.

01:03.521 --> 01:07.525
- If it happens, let me know.
- What the hell are you doing here?
This is not the office.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.820
- This is my private time.
- Five minutes.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.698
No- I said no Tuesday,
I said no last week...

01:13.865 --> 01:15.616
and I'm gonna keep sayin' no
till you hear me.

01:15.783 --> 01:18.494
Five minutes, Mr Chairman.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.581
It's all I ask-- five minutes.

01:21.747 --> 01:24.083
- Want some coffee?
- No, I don't want any coffee.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.627
I want to play with my dog.

01:26.794 --> 01:29.672
Look, I'm not asking you
to vote for it.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.508
I know you can't.
Just release your people.

01:32.633 --> 01:35.553
Let them go the way they want.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.724
Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act-

01:39.891 --> 01:42.268
Invasion of privacy is more like it.

01:42.435 --> 01:47.148
You read the Post?
"This bill is not the first step
toward the surveillance society.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.275
It is the surveillance society."

01:49.442 --> 01:52.278
- Uh, liberal hysteria.
- Oh, listen.
I'm not gonna sit in Congress...

01:52.445 --> 01:54.488
and pass a law
that lets the government...

01:54.655 --> 01:57.992
point a camera and a microphone
at anything they damn well please.

01:59.243 --> 02:03.414
Phil, look.
I don't care who bangs who...

02:03.581 --> 02:05.625
what cabinet officers get stoned.

02:05.791 --> 02:09.377
But this is the richest,
most powerful nation on Earth,
and therefore the most hated.

02:09.544 --> 02:11.964
And you and I know
what the average citizen does not:

02:12.131 --> 02:14.717
that we are at war
24 hours of every day.

02:14.884 --> 02:17.386
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:17.553 --> 02:20.139
Do I have to itemize the number
of American lives we've saved...

02:20.306 --> 02:24.310
in the past 12 months alone
with judicious use
of surveillance intelligence?

02:24.477 --> 02:28.147
Thomas, cut the crap.
I've got three major employers...

02:28.314 --> 02:32.652
in the Syracuse area alone who are
gonna get just killed by this bill.

02:34.278 --> 02:37.323
I promise to get you funds
equal to or greater than...

02:37.490 --> 02:40.076
whatever those companies
gave your last campaign.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.037
I'm not talking about
campaign contributions, damn it.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.998
I'm talking about my constituents
being out of work.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.334
Jesus, man- Wake up-

02:48.501 --> 02:51.838
National security isn't the only thing
going on in this country.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.551
God.

02:56.717 --> 02:59.303
This conversation is over.

02:59.470 --> 03:03.182
I beg of you, Phil.
Please don't.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.102
I've been there for you in the past,
haven't I? There have been times...

03:06.269 --> 03:10.231
personal situations, when you needed
my assistance and my confidence.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.860
Are you blackmailing me,
you ambitious shit?

03:14.026 --> 03:18.531
I'm sorry we can't find a common ground
on this one, Congressman.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.576
You're a good man.
People of your district are lucky...

03:21.742 --> 03:23.995
to have you representing them.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.588
Come on. Come on.

03:33.754 --> 03:35.590
Come on.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.934
Let me fight management.
Okay, I can accept that.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.478
But this is our own
goddamned union leadership...

06:35.645 --> 06:39.148
tryin' to railroad us into signing
some, some sweetheart contract.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.234
Look-- Look, everybody knows...

06:41.400 --> 06:45.029
that, that the mob
has been controlling these guys since,
since as long as I can remember.

06:45.196 --> 06:49.575
And now, uh-- now we got Pintero's goons
down there tuning up my people.

06:49.742 --> 06:53.246
Well, first off, that's a Hobbs Act
violation, probably a RICO.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.664
- Hey.
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Thanks.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.541
- How you doin'?
- Great.
- All right.
- Thanks.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.293
- Robert Dean.
- Tony O'Neill. Nice to meet you.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.506
A Hobbs and a RICO.
Ooh, baby, don't stop.

07:03.673 --> 07:08.219
Sounds like you guys need
a labour lawyer. What happened?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.055
We were in Louie's two nights ago.
I go to use the bathroom...

07:11.222 --> 07:12.682
and these two fuckin' guidos jump me.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.686
Uh, I prefer we use the term
"Italian-Americans."

07:16.853 --> 07:20.439
Eh, whatever, but they were
really goin' to work on me.
It could've gotten serious.

07:20.606 --> 07:24.652
- But then Larry Cash came in
and he went after 'em.
- Uh, Larry Cash is in the hospital...

07:24.819 --> 07:27.613
with a broken jaw
and a ruptured kidney.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.324
Is this becoming
a criminal investigation, Robert?

07:30.491 --> 07:33.035
Um, no, it would take years
to see that thing through.

07:33.202 --> 07:36.038
Besides, these people have families
that are living through this every day.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.544
Hey, Julie, can we send
a case of Chianti over to Larry Cash?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.629
- Larry Cash?
- Yes, he's at St. Luke's.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.924
And send some flowers to his wife,
Brenda. They're both in the Rolodex.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.468
Yes, Mr Dean.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.764
- Well, why don't you guys
just head on home?
- All right.

07:53.931 --> 07:57.852
I'm your lawyer. I'm in the process of
dealing with these guido motherfuckers.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.354
Pintero doesn't stand a chance.

08:04.483 --> 08:07.528
So, how's the trout?

08:07.695 --> 08:10.239
- Tastes like fish.
- It is fish.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.993
No, I mean it tastes like
every other fish I've ever had.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.287
Okay.

08:18.206 --> 08:22.210
Brill's note said that this
is the videotape that you need
to convince Pintero with.

08:22.376 --> 08:26.923
And watch out for the FBI. Brill says
the place is under surveillance.

08:27.089 --> 08:31.135
- So when do I get to meet him?
- Pintero?

08:31.302 --> 08:34.054
Brill.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.682
Never.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.851
Okay. Um--

08:39.018 --> 08:41.687
Wow. That's not exactly
the answer I was hoping for.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.940
Oh, and what was the answer
you were hoping for?

08:44.106 --> 08:47.610
Oh, I don't know. Soon.
Uh, definitely sooner than never.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.905
Bobby, why do we have to
go through this every time?

08:51.072 --> 08:55.034
Brill talks to me, I talk to you.
That's the way it works.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.245
Well, pardon me for being
a little uncomfortable...

08:57.411 --> 09:00.081
with hiring someone that I don't know
and I've never even met.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.625
Then don't hire him.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.048
Ten thousand dollars.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.468
And I'm also a little
uncomfortable havin' to carry
that kind of cash around.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.512
Well, this should lighten your load.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.682
I don't know if it's Brill's price
that's goin' up or your commission.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.726
I take 15%, as always.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.895
Brill's fee varies with risk.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.731
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
using someone else.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.777
- What, other than Brill?
- Other than me.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.989
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, there's nothing wrong with me.

09:33.155 --> 09:38.327
Just, you know, someone
with whom you don't have
quite so complicated a history.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.916
I like our history, and I like you.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.628
I like you too.

09:49.505 --> 09:53.301
Look, I-I just want to make sure that
I'm not breaking the law in any way.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.721
- You're not.
- And how can I be so sure?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.641
Because I wouldn't let you.

10:09.567 --> 10:15.239
So, Mr Pintero, the guy on the left is
Carl Matthews, president of Local 6650.

10:15.406 --> 10:19.202
And this is Dave Early,
secretary-treasurer of the National.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.078
Oh, right there, you see--
you see the guy there?

10:21.245 --> 10:24.040
Uh, that's Hugh Simic.
He administers the pension fund.

10:24.207 --> 10:29.337
Hey, you're going to recognize
this fellow right here.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.923
That's you.
Am I correct, Mr Pintero?

10:32.089 --> 10:34.050
That ain't me.

10:34.217 --> 10:37.386
Let's watch a little more of this.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.556
- Take a-- Take a picture of this.
- Everybody say "money."

10:40.723 --> 10:42.850
Here comes a great shot right here.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.144
Wait. Everybody say "not guilty."

10:45.311 --> 10:48.314
Right here; here it comes.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.068
- That's not you?
- That ain't me.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.196
Well, you know, that-that's actually
really great news for me.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.074
It lifts a huge weight
off of my shoulders.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.202
Because, you know, the conditions of
your parole specifically forbid you...

11:01.369 --> 11:05.414
from having any contact of any kind
with any union officials.

11:05.581 --> 11:09.168
- I know that.
- Well, I'm-- I'm saying,
so hypothetically...

11:09.335 --> 11:13.881
had that been you, I mean,
you'd be headed back to prison for...

11:14.048 --> 11:16.843
15-- I don't know--
maybe 20 years-- even more.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.596
But, you know, I mean, that ain't you,
as you so eloquently put it.

11:20.763 --> 11:25.059
Are you fuckin' with me?
Eloquently? That's not me.

11:25.226 --> 11:29.230
Oh, that's not you. Well, I'm sorry
that I've wasted your time, gentlemen...

11:29.397 --> 11:32.233
you know, since
that's not you, um--

11:35.778 --> 11:38.823
Oh, you know what? I'm thinkin'.
Maybe I'll just, you know...

11:38.990 --> 11:41.659
run this tape past
the federal prosecutor.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.953
You know, they have
really great VCRs down there.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.706
A lot of times, they can see
some things that we can't see.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.542
You ain't runnin' this by nobody.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.965
- What do you want?
- My clients want to vote
their contract up or down...

11:56.132 --> 12:00.469
as they see fit, without,
shall we say, any outside influences.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.514
Okay. Sit down.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.184
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- No, you are not fine.

12:06.350 --> 12:10.062
Now sit your ass down.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.951
I would like my clients to be able
to exercise their constitutional rights.

12:24.118 --> 12:28.039
And if that happens,
that tape will disappear forever
into my private collection...

12:28.206 --> 12:32.543
along with the Zapruder film
and the porno from Hitler's bunker.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.005
- Do you got any copies of this thing?
- Absolutely.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.341
Who made it? You make it?

12:38.508 --> 12:43.221
I'm an attorney.
I don't make videotapes.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.306
Now you listen to me,
you fuckin' eggplant.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.518
This fuckin' videotape
may save your clients' asses...

12:48.684 --> 12:51.604
but you can be goddamned sure
it ain't gonna save yours.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.274
Now, who made
the fuckin' videotape?

12:56.817 --> 13:00.738
- I don't know.
- How'd you get it?

13:00.905 --> 13:04.200
Through an acquaintance.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.495
Mr Dean, he's got acquaintances.
Me, I got friends. I don't know.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.997
Vic, get outside. See if they're
any acquaintances out there...

13:10.164 --> 13:12.333
that are of the black persuasion.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.503
Carlos, why don't you
get out of that chair?

13:17.004 --> 13:19.799
Talk to Mr Dean.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.555
Who's your fucking acquaintance?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.186
Listen to me. I wanna know
who made that videotape...

13:32.353 --> 13:34.897
but I wanna know in a week...

13:35.064 --> 13:37.567
or I'll kill ya.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.489
Hey, smile.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.075
- What?
- Smile for the FBI.

13:52.582 --> 13:57.086
- Who's the brother?
- I don't know, but he doesn't
look Italian to me, does he?

13:57.253 --> 14:00.756
Table Harvest to 101.
We got a blue overcoat heading east.

14:10.433 --> 14:14.145
Give me a loose one.
See if we can get his plates.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.362
I'm standing by live at the
Lockraven Reservoir right now...

14:23.529 --> 14:26.365
where police and fire officials
are in the process of removing...

14:26.532 --> 14:29.202
a classic Mercedes owned
by Republican Congressman...

14:29.368 --> 14:32.121
Phillip Hamersly
of Syracuse, New York.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.665
This accident comes
at a very untimely juncture...

14:34.832 --> 14:39.045
since the congressman was
working on a controversial
piece of legislation, Dale...

14:39.212 --> 14:42.548
opposing the Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.885
Fire officials do tell me
that it appears the congressman...

14:46.052 --> 14:48.012
was by himself in the car.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.515
We have confirmed that.
However, strangely enough...

14:50.681 --> 14:53.976
his favourite dog, Bob,
is currently with police.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.853
I understand there was
a history of heart problems.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.064
There was, in fact,
a history of heart problems.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.692
In fact, the congressman
endured open-heart surgery
just a couple of years ago.

15:01.859 --> 15:06.155
Homicide investigators have told me they
did find a bottle of pills in his lap.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.450
That might mean that the congressman--
and I speculate here--

15:09.617 --> 15:13.496
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.915
He leaves behind a family of four.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.085
We'll have more details
as the story develops.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.494
I need a 10-27 on a...

15:53.661 --> 15:57.248
brown and tan '75 GMC Jimmy.

15:57.415 --> 16:00.084
D.C. tags. Eight, kilo...

16:00.209 --> 16:02.712
six, three, nine, four.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.047
And a 10-28 on the registered owner.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.237
Jake, please do not give me
optimistic numbers. I hate optimism.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.906
- Sir?
- I want to know how many votes
we have in the bank...

16:30.072 --> 16:33.075
aren't gonna change their mind
every time the wind blows.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.828
Thank you.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.539
We may have a problem
out at the lake.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.001
This is Daniel Zavitz.
He's a nature photographer
who was in government grants.

16:42.168 --> 16:46.797
One of them is for monitoring
migratory patterns of Canadian geese.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.966
Or lack thereof.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.845
The box is called a hide.
It contains a motion-activated...

16:53.012 --> 16:55.348
digital video camera
with a compound lens.

16:55.515 --> 17:00.144
It was aimed directly
at the boat ramp across the lake.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.492
We need two techs with full electronic
capabilities-- two humpty-dumpties.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.913
Get Fiedler to organize it,
and call Kramer...

17:19.079 --> 17:20.832
to get us some ex-military cutouts.

17:20.998 --> 17:24.627
How do I describe the project?

17:24.794 --> 17:30.132
Call it a training op hosted here.
Set up a link with the NRO.

17:30.258 --> 17:33.761
- That's good.
- Falsify FBI approval.

17:33.928 --> 17:38.099
And none of this goes beyond our team.
And get that videotape.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.352
- Of course.
- Get a wire on our bird-watcher.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.938
You got it.

17:45.231 --> 17:48.526
Fiedler, it's Hicks. I need
an intercept on a Daniel Leon Zavitz.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.820
202-555-0108.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.406
And, uh, what's our authorization?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.992
We're calling it a P-1 training op.
FBI approval.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.744
Krug and Jones, sir.

17:58.911 --> 18:02.165
We were with the 22nd Marine
expeditionary unit. Kramer sent us.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.917
- Oh, nice haircut.
- Thirty months in
a federal penitentiary...

18:05.084 --> 18:08.254
at Marion, Illinois, for a GVH-1--
on your gunnery sergeant--
what's that about?

18:08.421 --> 18:13.134
The guy was an asshole, sir,
and he deserved it, if you'll excuse me.

18:20.433 --> 18:24.270
All new, designed for today.

18:24.437 --> 18:28.566
The electric car is here.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.360
A sedan for you.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.571
I'm standing by live
at the Lockraven Reservoir...

18:33.738 --> 18:36.782
right now, where police
and fire officials are
in the process of removing...

18:36.949 --> 18:40.870
a classic Mercedes owned by
Republican congressman Phillip Hamersly.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.706
You may be able to see it here,
being removed in the background.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.542
Now, fire and police officials
aren't saying much at this point.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.712
Here's what I do know.
I have been told that the congressman...

18:49.879 --> 18:54.300
was alone in the vehicle
when this accident happened
just under an hour ago.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.345
You may know that the congressman
suffers from a heart condition.

18:57.512 --> 19:01.516
Homicide investigators
have told me that they did find
a bottle of pills in his lap.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.977
That might mean that the congressman--
and I speculate here--

19:05.144 --> 19:08.314
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.734
I am also told that there was no one
in the car with him at the time of the--

19:11.901 --> 19:15.071
- Fuck a duck.
- However, curiously enough,
the congressman's dog Bob--

19:15.238 --> 19:17.448
Holy shit-

19:17.615 --> 19:19.951
...on the ground,
and is currently with police.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.203
He's from Syracuse, New York.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.874
The congressman was a key opponent
to the Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.629
- News desk.
- Lenny...

19:31.796 --> 19:35.091
you are not going to believe
what I have in my possession.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.927
- Zavitz. Long time.
- Lenny, I've got...

19:38.052 --> 19:41.138
the Phil Hamersly murder on videotape.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.599
Phil Hamersly died
of a heart attack.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.978
Negative. Hamersly was professionally
wasted under the direction...

19:47.144 --> 19:51.691
of some anal-retentive with what looks
like a serious vitamin D deficiency.

19:51.858 --> 19:56.320
- Well, how did you get this tape?
- My conservation study at the
lake photographed the murder.

19:56.487 --> 19:59.991
- You're kidding me-
- The camera was aimed
straight across at the pier...

20:00.157 --> 20:02.076
right where Phil Hamersly was killed.

20:02.243 --> 20:06.247
- How fast can you get
that tape over here?
- I'm making a copy right now.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.916
Uh, Mark, I have to take this.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.795
Good. Thank you.
Call if you need anything.

20:17.967 --> 20:22.054
- Fiedler, is this line secure?
- Yes, it is, sir.
- Go ahead.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.223
Zavitz is speaking
to a Lenny Bloom...

20:24.390 --> 20:26.434
a former anti-war activist.

20:26.601 --> 20:30.688
He publishes a variety
of left-wing newsletters
on various political subjects.

20:30.855 --> 20:34.734
- He's taking the tape now
to Bloom's offices. Over.
- Put a tap on Bloom.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.946
- And give us a dedicated
satellite for this operation.
- It's already done.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.699
Yeah, so, Julie, I'm gonna take
the rest of the day.

20:41.866 --> 20:45.536
Uh, finish up my Christmas shopping.
Take my mind off things.

20:46.787 --> 20:50.458
Hey, do chicks dig lingerie?

20:50.625 --> 20:53.711
All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.798
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.884
How you doin'?

21:00.051 --> 21:02.220
Why, hello.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.680
- Hi.
- Hey, hi.
- Can I help you?

21:04.847 --> 21:08.434
- Uh, yes.
- Do you see something you like?

21:08.601 --> 21:11.979
- Uh, I'm married.
- That's allowed.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.440
Uh-- Uh, um, I just--
I need-- I need some...

21:14.607 --> 21:17.026
uh, a-- a Christmas present.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.404
- For your wife ?
- Yes, of-of several years.
We're ver-- We're, uh, yes.

21:20.571 --> 21:24.700
- So you want some
lingerie for your wife?
- Yes, yes, I-I would.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.078
Do you like Christian Dior?

21:27.245 --> 21:31.999
You know, I have to be really
honest with you. Um, I'm not
really experienced in this.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.836
- I don't--
- Get out of town-

21:34.961 --> 21:37.797
I-I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean,
I'm-I'm experienced, you know, from--

21:37.964 --> 21:40.466
- Yeah.
- from a certain perspective.
- Right.
- I-I just--

21:40.633 --> 21:44.387
You know, I don't want to come in here
and, you know, look stupid.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.472
Too late.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.183
- Yeah. What size?
- I'm sorry?

21:50.184 --> 21:53.187
- Oh, my wife. Oh.
- Yeah.
- Uh, she-she's, um--

21:53.354 --> 21:55.857
- She's about, uh-- She--
- Size six.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.276
Yeah, right, she's, uh--
She's ab-- She's a six.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.528
Right. And what about cup size?

22:00.695 --> 22:02.947
Um--

22:03.114 --> 22:05.658
Oh- Oh, she's way bigger than that.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.828
I mean, uh, not--
I mean, not noticeably.

22:08.995 --> 22:12.331
- Oops.
- Should have gotten her a watch.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.917
- So far--
- Hello?

22:15.084 --> 22:19.630
- It's me, Ruthie.
- Shit.
- Uh, they disconnected my phone again.

22:19.797 --> 22:23.634
Uh, mine's not working either.
I think it's a problem with the line.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.679
Um--

22:26.846 --> 22:30.600
Let me borrow some change
for the pay phone, man.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.477
Come on. I gotta call Dr Mike.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.652
Danny-

22:41.819 --> 22:46.240
Danny, I always pay you back.
Come on-

22:46.407 --> 22:48.618
Danny-

22:54.540 --> 22:57.835
Open the door-

22:58.002 --> 23:00.087
Shit. Fuck.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.178
- Come on, man-
- Uh, one minute.

23:07.345 --> 23:10.848
- I'm goin'.
- Come on, Danny-

23:12.517 --> 23:15.102
Come on. Come on.

23:16.854 --> 23:20.107
Oh, shit.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.285
Ah, shit.
It's not working.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.874
I got him- I got him-
He's rabbiting-

23:38.501 --> 23:43.422
- He's out the back.
- Give me real-time imagery coverage
at LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.758
Got it. Base, this is local control.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.261
Request immediate keyhole
visual tasking. Maximum resolution.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.180
LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00. Over.

23:51.347 --> 23:54.392
Roger that. I'll need a minute
on satellite visual. Over.

23:54.559 --> 23:57.854
Run, run, Danny-
They got guns- Go-

23:58.020 --> 24:00.314
- Where is he?
- He's on the roof. Right there. Go-

24:02.900 --> 24:06.904
-Okay, satellite imagery coming through.
-Roger that. Patch visual, my location.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.448
Confirm visual. Thank you much.
Air One, ahead.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.869
All units:
Target heading north on rooftop.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.997
Columbia and 18th.
Request immediate visual support. Over.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.999
Roger that. We have visual.

24:31.429 --> 24:34.307
Everybody move.
He just jumped to the adjacent building.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.398
- All units,
he is entering rear entrance--
- Entering entrance of Captain Ike's.

24:42.565 --> 24:45.568
- Captain Ike's.
- Roger.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.622
Get out of the way-

25:03.085 --> 25:05.046
Hey-

25:07.965 --> 25:10.635
- Air One, be advised, suspect
heading towards front entrance.
- Front of Columbia.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.179
- Detail front of building on Columbia.
- Copy that.

25:20.811 --> 25:23.606
I got him- I got him-

25:24.732 --> 25:27.193
All units, target
entering the barber-shop.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.913
- Hah- Bullshit-
We lost him; we lost him.
- We've lost him-

25:39.080 --> 25:42.416
- I can't--
- Units in pursuit, target seen exiting
rear of barber-shop in alley. Follow.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.804
- Okay, I'm blank. I can't see anything.
- Air One, we've lost the visual.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.807
- I'm blank. What do you got?
- Who's got him?

26:00.685 --> 26:03.229
Zavitz- Dan Zavitz-

26:05.022 --> 26:08.442
Hey, uh-- It's me, Bobby Dean. We were
at Georgetown together. You okay?

26:08.609 --> 26:11.988
- Help me.
- Are you hurt?
- What do you think of this one, sir?

26:12.154 --> 26:14.949
Yeah, this is Becky.
Becky, say hi.

26:15.116 --> 26:18.536
I'm s-- Can I have one second, please?

26:19.662 --> 26:21.289
Oh, he's right on top of Pratt.
He's running from Pratt on Connecticut.

26:21.455 --> 26:24.750
- Pratt, he's on your 6:00. Turn around.
- Got him-

26:24.917 --> 26:27.628
Move, move, move.
Get out of the way-

26:27.795 --> 26:32.466
Hey, hey-
Come back, man- Come back-

26:32.633 --> 26:36.095
Hey, I got him-

26:36.262 --> 26:38.389
Target northbound--
northbound on Connecticut.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.433
Okay, got him.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.519
Go, go, go, go-

26:53.988 --> 26:57.241
Switching targets. Switching.
Now heading southbound
towards DuPont circle.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.754
Stop-

27:27.688 --> 27:30.358
Target down on Connecticut Avenue.
Air One, confirm.

27:30.483 --> 27:34.612
Target is down.
Target is down permanently.

27:45.623 --> 27:48.709
- What happened?
- A guy on a bike got creamed.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.966
Oh, Jesus.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.165
- I'm beatin' you.
- Yeah, right.

28:27.331 --> 28:30.626
- Oh, you are.
- Oh, sh--

28:30.793 --> 28:33.171
- Hey, hey-
- I'm beatin' you.
- No, I'm beatin' you.

28:33.337 --> 28:36.382
- I just caught up.
- Hello.
- Oh, yeah?
- Hi, Mr Dean.

28:36.549 --> 28:39.093
Am I in the wrong house?

28:39.260 --> 28:41.971
I'm looking for an eight-year-old boy,
about yea high.

28:42.138 --> 28:44.891
- Kinda good-looking. Allegedly my son.
- No.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.853
- Hmm. Maybe he's behind the TV.
- Eric?
- Mr Dean-
- Dad-

28:49.020 --> 28:50.771
- Eric?
- Mr Dean, get out-
- Get out of the way-

28:50.938 --> 28:53.316
What? What? Oh, I'm sorry.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.819
- Are those my Christmas presents?
- Yep, some of 'em.

28:56.986 --> 28:59.197
- Can I open 'em?
- Yeah, sure. Here you go.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.575
- Seriously?
- In your dreams, buddy. Beat it.
- Dad-

29:02.742 --> 29:05.411
- Are you staying for dinner
tonight, Dylan?
- If it's okay with you.

29:05.536 --> 29:08.414
- Got any money?
- Money?
- He's kidding.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.542
- I'm going to sleep over
at Dylan's, okay?
- Did you ask your mother?

29:11.709 --> 29:14.378
I was going to, but she's
too busy yelling at the TV.

29:14.504 --> 29:18.633
Oh, well, there goes the Fourth
Amendment-- what's left of it.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.552
- Hey, Maria.
- Hello, Mr Bobby.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.805
Don't you honestly doubt
that the average citizen--

29:24.972 --> 29:27.642
Hey, you're about a bark-and-a-half
from being homeless.

29:27.767 --> 29:31.395
Baby, listen to
this fascist gas bag.

29:31.562 --> 29:34.232
- Uh-oh.
- ...and freedom have
always existed in a--

29:34.357 --> 29:39.612
in a very precarious balance,
and when buildings start blowing up,
people's priorities tend to change.

29:39.779 --> 29:42.990
- He's got a point there, sweetie.
- Bobby-

29:43.157 --> 29:47.662
- I mean, who is this idiot?
- He is talking about ending
personal privacy.

29:47.829 --> 29:51.916
- Do you want your phone tapped?
- I'm not plannin' on
blowing up the country.

29:52.083 --> 29:55.503
Well, how do we know until we've heard
all your dirty little secrets?

29:55.670 --> 29:58.714
You're just gonna have to trust me.

29:58.881 --> 30:01.801
Oh, I know.
We'll just tap the criminals.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.428
We won't suspend the civil rights
of the good people.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.431
- Right.
- Then who decides which is which?

30:07.598 --> 30:11.477
- I think you should.
- You know, Bobby, I think you
should take this more seriously.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.397
Honey, I think you're taking it
seriously enough for both of us...

30:14.564 --> 30:17.650
and half the people on the block.

30:20.570 --> 30:23.322
Tens of millions of foreign nationals
living within our borders...

30:23.489 --> 30:26.409
and many of these people consider
the United States their enemy.

30:26.576 --> 30:31.372
- And they see acts of terrorism as--
- You remember Daniel Zavitz?

30:31.539 --> 30:34.333
- We were at Georgetown together?
- Vaguely.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.045
- I saw him today.
- How's he doing?

30:38.212 --> 30:40.882
- He's dead.
- What?

30:41.048 --> 30:45.469
- He got hit by a fire engine
pretty much in front of my eyes.
- Oh, my God-

30:45.636 --> 30:48.472
I ran into him in a store,
and he was upset about something.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.683
- About what?
- I don't know.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.895
Before we had a chance to talk about it,
he ran out of the store...

30:54.061 --> 30:57.857
and next time I saw him,
he was dead.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.776
Baby- Come here.

31:00.943 --> 31:04.447
Ohh, I love you so much-

31:04.614 --> 31:06.699
I love you, too, sweetie.

31:09.118 --> 31:11.954
Oh, that's not even to mention
the gangster that threatened
to kill me today.

31:12.121 --> 31:16.417
- Hah- Very funny-
- Oh, you think? Hilarious.

31:16.584 --> 31:19.378
- Hmm. What'd you get me?
- A bowling ball.

31:20.713 --> 31:23.799
No more of that MSNBC terrorist talk.
You're scaring the kids.

31:23.966 --> 31:27.470
We'll be back with your phone calls for
Congressman Sam Albert right after this.

31:29.639 --> 31:32.517
- Tell me.
- Zavitz is dead. So is Lenny,
the guy from the paper.

31:32.683 --> 31:35.269
- What about the tape?
- We found the original
in Zavitz's apartment.

31:35.436 --> 31:37.230
- The original?
- There was a copy.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.815
- There was a copy?
- I think so, sir.
- Any more good news?

31:39.982 --> 31:42.652
They never made it to the newspaper,
but there was a private sector contact.

31:42.777 --> 31:44.987
- Who was that?
- Several indiscriminants
and one primary.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.323
- Who?
- Robert Dean.
He's a D.C. Labour lawyer.

31:47.490 --> 31:51.327
Lives in Georgetown with his wife,
Carla Dean. She's also an attorney.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.579
She's with the ACLU, as it happens.

31:53.746 --> 31:56.749
Well, I suppose he could've given it
directly to Bob Woodward.

31:56.916 --> 32:01.462
Maybe we dodged a bullet.
Find out what Dean knows.

32:01.629 --> 32:03.548
- Make contact.
- Yes, sir.

32:03.714 --> 32:06.884
I hate doing this at Christmas.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.807
Fiedler, we need
a complete FinCEN, EPIC...

32:12.974 --> 32:15.184
and a DRD work-up
on a Robert Clayton Dean.

32:15.351 --> 32:20.231
His social's 986-26-0901.
Pull up keyhole data files, okay?

32:20.398 --> 32:23.734
Let's go-
Let's get this show on the road-

32:23.901 --> 32:27.989
Eric, just call me in the morning
when you want me to come pick you up.

32:28.156 --> 32:31.075
You know, if you decide
you want to stay at Dylan's
till the end of the weekend...

32:31.242 --> 32:34.704
or the end of the century,
your mom and I have discussed it.

32:34.871 --> 32:38.416
It'll be difficult initially,
but we think we can live with it.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.836
Dad's kidding.
He's gonna miss you, just like me.

32:43.963 --> 32:47.466
Honey, hurry back.
You know what that means.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.011
Mm-hmm. That you're gonna
be asleep when I get back.

32:50.178 --> 32:52.930
That only happened
one time, sweetie.

32:53.097 --> 32:56.601
We're running
a comprehensive database search.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.978
Brian did a preliminary
analysis and comparison...

32:59.145 --> 33:02.106
and he came up with
some pretty interesting stuff.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.445
Thanks, Brian.

33:07.570 --> 33:10.114
Thank you.

33:10.281 --> 33:13.409
Prioritize his phone bill.

33:13.576 --> 33:16.162
Who's he been calling?

33:18.080 --> 33:20.291
- Oh, man. Check this one.
- Who?

33:20.458 --> 33:24.212
Rachel F-For-You-Know-What Banks. God,
would I love to have her ruin my life.

33:24.378 --> 33:26.672
Do a cross.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.175
They were at Georgetown
together, sophomore year.

33:29.342 --> 33:32.303
They have the same address,
same phone number.

33:32.470 --> 33:36.474
They remain close.
Many calls, regardless of marriage.

33:36.641 --> 33:38.976
- Oh, here we go.
- What?

33:39.143 --> 33:41.854
Dean, over the past 18 months...

33:42.021 --> 33:46.526
has four, five, seven cash
withdrawals of 4,000, 5,000...

33:46.692 --> 33:49.111
and up, and up...

33:49.278 --> 33:51.781
and each time,
the delectable Miss Banks...

33:51.948 --> 33:54.617
makes large cash deposits
of her own within a day or two.

33:54.784 --> 33:59.789
- Blackmail?
- Well, her deposits aren't the same,
but let me figure this out.

33:59.956 --> 34:05.211
Ah, yes, they're exactly-- exactly
15 percent of the amount Dean withdrew.

34:05.378 --> 34:08.380
Brian, can we get some more?

34:08.547 --> 34:11.926
I mean, you know, we got the blimp cam,
we got the police officer cam...

34:12.092 --> 34:16.179
we've got, uh, two ATM cameras,
but this is the one showing promise.

34:16.347 --> 34:19.308
This is the security camera
at the underwear store. Freeze there.

34:20.851 --> 34:24.313
Rotate us 75 degrees
around the vertical, please.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.149
Freeze there. Times ten.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.696
Focus on the drop.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.701
Enhance, then forward frame-by-frame.

34:40.413 --> 34:43.791
All right. Now, just before
the view's blocked, there's
a shape change in Dean's bag.

34:43.958 --> 34:46.168
See the shadow variance? See?

34:46.335 --> 34:51.007
The shadow's wrong. Zavitz changed
the configuration of Dean's packages.

34:51.174 --> 34:54.260
- Is it a tape?
- It's hard to say for sure.
These things are--

34:54.427 --> 34:58.264
- Can the computer take us
around to the other side?
- It can hypothesize. Chris?

34:58.431 --> 35:02.476
- Yeah?
- Can you rotate us 75 degrees
around the vertical, please?

35:05.980 --> 35:09.525
- What do you think it is?
- It looks a lot bigger than a tape.

35:09.692 --> 35:13.613
Zavitz had digital compression
equipment in his apartment.
He could've downloaded it to anything.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.698
Or maybe the bag twisted
in Dean's hand.

35:15.865 --> 35:19.452
Or something moved in front
of the light and altered
the shadow. Maybe it's nothing.

35:19.619 --> 35:22.622
Maybe it's everything.
Let's get it and find out.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.585
Beat it. I got work to do.

35:27.752 --> 35:30.588
Go. Porsche-

35:34.592 --> 35:37.553
Go away-

35:37.720 --> 35:39.222
Damn it, Porsche-

35:40.598 --> 35:42.850
- Hello, Mr Dean?
- Uh, yes. Can I help you?

35:43.017 --> 35:46.979
This is Detective Benning.
I'm Pratt. We're with D.C. Metro.

35:47.146 --> 35:50.900
Uh, sorry to bother you at home, sir.
We were just hoping to ask you
a few questions about Daniel Zavitz.

35:51.067 --> 35:53.778
- Wh-- I'm s-- Can I see
your badges, please?
- Certainly, sir.

35:53.945 --> 35:56.197
Sure.

35:58.074 --> 36:01.369
All right. Come on.
Back up, Porsche.

36:04.413 --> 36:06.207
- All right. Nice and smooth.
Come on, boys.
- Okay.

36:06.374 --> 36:08.501
I didn't really see the accident.
I don't know whose fault it was.

36:08.668 --> 36:12.421
- Oh, we're not here to talk
about the accident, Mr Dean.
- I'm sorry, I thought you said
you were here--

36:12.588 --> 36:14.924
We should apologize
for the confusion, sir.

36:15.091 --> 36:17.343
It's just that we're handling
a different aspect of the inquiry.

36:17.510 --> 36:21.180
Um, it turns out Mr Zavitz was
involved in an extortion scheme.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.517
- What kind of watch is that?
- Did you represent Mr Zavitz
as an attorney?
- It's an Omega.

36:24.684 --> 36:27.895
- No, I didn't.
- So you're not constrained
by attorney-client privilege?

36:28.062 --> 36:30.731
- Shh-shh. Yeah, that's correct.
- You see, Mr Dean...

36:30.898 --> 36:34.318
we have reason to believe
that Mr Zavitz may have passed
sensitive materials to you.

36:35.987 --> 36:39.657
- What kind of materials?
- Well, sensitive, so we're hoping
that you could tell us that.

36:40.908 --> 36:42.952
Uh, no, he-he didn't pass me anything.

36:43.119 --> 36:46.539
These voice stress points indicate
a really high degree of anxiety.

36:46.706 --> 36:49.917
- Anxiety about what?
- That's the nature of physics.

36:50.084 --> 36:53.004
If he'd have given me something,
I would've known.

36:53.171 --> 36:56.424
- Oh, he's lying-
- What about your packages, sir?

36:56.591 --> 36:59.510
Could something have slipped in amongst
the purchases without your knowledge?

36:59.677 --> 37:02.638
Excuse me. Daniel Zavitz
did not give me anything.

37:02.805 --> 37:05.808
- That's a Parker pen.
- It's a Mont Blanc.

37:05.975 --> 37:09.061
He didn't secrete it
into any of my bodily orifices.

37:09.228 --> 37:12.231
- Whatever it is, I don't have it.
- Could we look at them?

37:12.398 --> 37:15.651
- I don't think so.
Not without a warrant.
- Oh, Christ.

37:15.818 --> 37:18.362
- This guy's good.
- How did you happen
to be at Ruby's today?

37:18.529 --> 37:20.865
I was shopping for some lingerie.
That's still legal, isn't it?

37:21.032 --> 37:24.702
- You buying that for your wife?
- No, I was, uh, picking
something up for myself.

37:24.869 --> 37:27.997
I do a little cross-dressing
on the weekends.
You know, you'd be surprised...

37:28.164 --> 37:31.042
how a nice pair of edible panties
can make a guy feel sexy.

37:31.209 --> 37:35.171
We thought it might be
for Rachel Banks.

37:35.338 --> 37:37.673
Good night, gentlemen.

37:39.091 --> 37:42.136
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Mr Dean.

37:59.028 --> 38:02.406
What are they talking about, Porsche?
There's nothing here.

38:08.955 --> 38:11.082
Honey, I'm home.

38:12.333 --> 38:15.711
Uh, yeah, uh, just a second, sweetie.

38:23.511 --> 38:26.264
Well, either he's getting ready
to do something with it,
or he doesn't know he has it.

38:26.430 --> 38:29.600
Or he doesn't have it.

38:29.767 --> 38:31.978
You know what I've seen?

38:32.144 --> 38:37.024
I've seen killers walk free
because the eyewitness was an alcoholic.

38:37.191 --> 38:40.319
I've seen sex offenders
that couldn't be touched
because the victim was a call girl.

38:40.486 --> 38:46.325
Credibility-- It's the only
currency that means anything
on this kind of playing field.

38:46.492 --> 38:50.580
Dean's got the tape,
and he's gonna come out with it; and
when he does, I want his credibility.

38:50.746 --> 38:53.457
I want people to know he's lying
before they hear what he says.

38:53.624 --> 38:56.752
We could take his wife and kid.
He'd give it up for them.

38:56.919 --> 38:59.463
We'd have the police and the FBI
all over this in 24 hours.

38:59.630 --> 39:02.967
Put taps on his 20
most frequently called numbers,
and let's get into his life.

39:03.134 --> 39:05.970
The union situation has--
has mob written all over it.

39:06.137 --> 39:08.181
And he's definitely vulnerable
on Rachel Banks.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.141
I want to know about his wife,
I want to know about his parents...

39:10.308 --> 39:13.603
I want to know about
his gambling problems,
his urine samples, his porno rentals.

39:13.769 --> 39:16.480
I want to use every means possible
to get what we need...

39:16.647 --> 39:19.650
because this little
son of a bitch is not going to be
the final chapter of my life.

39:25.490 --> 39:27.575
- Tell me something.
- Uh-oh.

39:27.742 --> 39:31.704
How did you find out Pintero
was associated with union officials?

39:31.871 --> 39:34.790
I'm just that good.

39:34.957 --> 39:37.668
I hired an investigator.

39:47.011 --> 39:49.680
- Hey.
- Shut up the dog-

39:49.805 --> 39:54.143
My mom used to have one of these.
Come on. Ow- The dog bit me-

39:54.310 --> 39:58.689
- Oh, who was the investigator?
- Wh-- I-- What do you mean? His name?

39:58.856 --> 40:02.902
Come on, Bobby. You know what I'm
asking. Is it the guy who Rachel knows?

40:04.278 --> 40:06.197
Ca-- Why do we-- Why do we have
to go through this every time?

40:06.364 --> 40:11.202
- Bobby, I'm just asking, okay?
- Carla, Rachel Banks is not
an issue any more.

40:27.093 --> 40:31.639
You are the only woman
in the world for me.

40:31.806 --> 40:34.267
You and Janet Jackson.

40:34.433 --> 40:38.020
I-I have to be honest.
If-lf Janet Jackson called me...

40:38.187 --> 40:41.023
I w-- I-- I might have to change
my last name to Jackson.

40:41.190 --> 40:45.236
Yeah, right. I'd have to break
that woman's legs too.

40:53.661 --> 40:57.206
- Lower, lower,
like kids would do it, damn it.
- You sound like a fuckin' old lady.
Shut up.

40:57.373 --> 41:00.501
Ooh, sensitive.

41:00.668 --> 41:03.880
All right. Jones has some issues
we need to resolve.

41:05.798 --> 41:08.384
- Oh. Hey, Control, they are home.
- Uh-oh.

41:14.390 --> 41:16.726
Move, guys.

41:16.893 --> 41:18.769
Oh, nice blender.

41:25.026 --> 41:27.695
Oh, my God.

41:31.741 --> 41:33.409
Oh, Porsche.

41:35.995 --> 41:40.291
Oh, damn. The dog is green.

41:40.458 --> 41:43.503
Jones painted the-- the dog-

41:43.669 --> 41:46.506
This is Robert Dean, 2811 Sutton.
I'd like to report a break-in.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.634
I don't know. Um, it's been vandalized.
From the looks of it, i-it's kids...

41:49.800 --> 41:52.220
but I need a squad car
here immediately.

42:01.103 --> 42:05.233
- Here we go.
- We'll be checking out the rest
of the house, sir, ma'am.

42:11.697 --> 42:14.200
At least they left me one.

42:19.872 --> 42:22.291
How do you know
it wasn't Pintero?

42:22.458 --> 42:25.336
I don't. It was just
kind of frivolous.

42:25.503 --> 42:28.548
I guess I'm just hopin'
it was kids.

42:38.516 --> 42:41.185
John.

42:50.945 --> 42:53.406
What have we here?

42:56.284 --> 42:59.036
I think we have a winner.

43:00.371 --> 43:02.373
Phone for phone.

43:02.540 --> 43:04.959
- Take any of your clothes?
- No.

43:05.126 --> 43:07.545
They threw all my shoes
and suits in the tub...

43:07.712 --> 43:09.630
and spray painted my damn dog.

43:11.090 --> 43:13.301
- Black.
- Black.

43:13.467 --> 43:15.469
Perfect. How does that look?

43:15.636 --> 43:18.181
Paging Mr Dean.

43:18.347 --> 43:20.850
We have you bugged, Mr Dean.

43:21.017 --> 43:25.855
They thrashed my computers,
my big-screen TV-- They took my blender.

43:26.022 --> 43:28.441
- What about jewellery?
- Nope.

43:28.608 --> 43:32.487
- What about silverware?
- Nope. Just my blender.

43:32.653 --> 43:35.406
- Blender, huh?
- Loved that blender.

43:35.573 --> 43:38.409
You know, I did stuff
when I was a kid.

43:38.576 --> 43:41.370
I mean, not breaking-and-entering,
but, you know, stuff.

43:41.537 --> 43:44.832
Yeah, we all did stuff. I just wish
they hadn't stolen my damn blender.

43:44.999 --> 43:47.793
You seem a little attached
to this blender, Robert.

43:47.960 --> 43:52.590
Yeah, well, some people meditate,
some people get massages.

43:52.757 --> 43:56.552
- I blend.
- You're really weird, you know that?

43:56.719 --> 44:00.973
Yeah, then on top of it, the only suit
they leave me is three years old.

44:01.140 --> 44:03.017
Hasn't gotten any better with age.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.856
Blow over? I'm not--
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for this to blow over-

44:09.023 --> 44:12.652
Jerry, I-- I'm, I'm suing their
right-wing asses right into Chapter 11-

44:12.819 --> 44:15.988
This is flagrant- They never even called
to see what my side of the story was-

44:16.155 --> 44:18.991
- They have no Sullivan
protection with this-
- Mr Dean?

44:19.158 --> 44:21.410
- Yes.
- Rachel Banks is on line one...

44:21.577 --> 44:24.038
and, uh, Silverberg and Blake
would like to see you
in the conference room.

44:24.205 --> 44:28.042
All right. Uh, Jerry, uh,
I got to take this call. All right.

44:28.209 --> 44:31.796
- Hey, what's up?
- My firm called me this morning
telling me not to come in.

44:31.963 --> 44:34.298
- What? Why not?
- I don't know.

44:34.465 --> 44:37.343
Reporters are calling, asking me
about my relationship with you...

44:37.510 --> 44:40.179
and how long
I've worked for the mob.

44:40.346 --> 44:42.932
- The mob, Bobby.
- Jesus.

44:43.099 --> 44:46.727
- Do you know how hard
I worked to get this job?
- Yeah, I know. I know.

44:46.894 --> 44:49.981
Mr Dean, Silverberg and Blake
are still waiting to see you
in the conference room.

44:50.147 --> 44:53.317
- I heard you the first time.
Thank you.
- Look. You got your own problems.

44:53.484 --> 44:55.486
Uh, no, Rachel. It's fine.

44:55.653 --> 44:57.864
Oh, g--

45:04.495 --> 45:06.956
I just got off the phone
with a source that I trust.

45:07.123 --> 45:11.252
A grand jury is being convened
to look into your labour practise...

45:11.419 --> 45:14.172
as far back as the
electrical workers' strike.

45:14.338 --> 45:19.552
- And why is that?
- They claim you helped create a shell
company for Sam Villotti in Zurich...

45:19.719 --> 45:23.639
and that through your continuing
relationship, the Peitso family
has been able...

45:23.806 --> 45:28.811
to exert influence and provide
false witness to discredit our case.

45:28.978 --> 45:30.897
- Oh, well, that's true.
- You're admitting it?

45:31.063 --> 45:35.193
Sure. Everything except
setting up a company in Zurich...

45:35.359 --> 45:37.695
or even knowing anyone
named Sam Villotti...

45:37.862 --> 45:41.908
or having any relationship
whatsoever to the Peitso family-

45:42.074 --> 45:45.077
- This is ridiculous-
- Robert--
- Uh, Mark, I'm tell you.

45:45.244 --> 45:46.954
This is Pintero.
He's coming back after me.

45:47.121 --> 45:49.916
You give me one week-- one week
and four guys from litigation...

45:50.082 --> 45:52.960
and I guarantee you,
we have this guy begging us--

45:53.127 --> 45:55.505
Tell us about Rachel Banks.

45:58.424 --> 46:01.928
Tell you what. Uh, she was my girlfriend
the second year of law school.

46:02.094 --> 46:06.599
We keep in touch.
We-We toss one another some work
every once in a while. Uh, that's it.

46:06.766 --> 46:10.019
Did you have an affair
with her four years ago?

46:12.730 --> 46:15.316
You ever beat off
in the shower, Brian?

46:15.483 --> 46:17.527
Hmm? You ever have
any homosexual thoughts?

46:17.693 --> 46:22.740
- Bobby, that is--
- None of my fucking business-
You're damn right it's not-

46:22.907 --> 46:25.785
I love my wife,
and I love my son absolutely...

46:25.952 --> 46:29.914
with no equivocations, and that's
none of your fuckin' business either-

46:30.081 --> 46:32.333
Uh, we think that you
should take a leave of absence...

46:32.500 --> 46:34.502
until we're able
to, uh, sort all this out.

46:34.669 --> 46:37.588
- Are you firing me?
- I think you just fired yourself.

46:49.475 --> 46:51.727
Carla-

46:53.980 --> 46:57.984
Where is she, Jen?

46:58.151 --> 47:00.611
- Don't go in there.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Why not?

47:00.778 --> 47:03.698
Because she's reading the paper.

47:07.326 --> 47:09.453
- Asshole.
- Carla--

47:11.789 --> 47:15.042
- How could you let me
find out like this?
- I'm findin' out like this.

47:15.209 --> 47:17.879
This is all lies.
Th-- None of this stuff is true.

47:18.004 --> 47:20.756
- So you're saying
you weren't there with her?
- Yes, I had lunch with her.

47:20.923 --> 47:24.552
We have lunch once a month. She's the
contact for the investigator, Brill.

47:24.719 --> 47:29.015
You were right about that. Someone
must have taken this picture off the
security camera outside the restaurant.

47:29.182 --> 47:33.144
- You said she wasn't an issue.
- She's not- I have to see her
for business.

47:33.311 --> 47:37.732
-And I-- And I knew if I told you that--
-Bobby, you had an affair
with this woman- An affair.

47:37.899 --> 47:40.568
We went to a counsellor for a year-

47:40.693 --> 47:44.822
And now you're standin' there lyin'
about even seein' her? You make me sick-

47:47.867 --> 47:52.205
Carla, I am smeared all over
the newspapers for money-laundering
schemes, mob ties--

47:52.371 --> 47:55.374
I lost my job. I am asking you--

47:55.541 --> 47:59.795
I'm asking you to please just trust me
on this Rachel Banks thing right now.

47:59.962 --> 48:04.842
How in God's name can I trust you?
Bobby, I want you to leave.

48:05.009 --> 48:07.678
- Carla, I'm telling you
that this is all bullshit-
- I don't wanna hear anything else.

48:07.803 --> 48:11.974
I don't wanna hear anything else.
I cannot think with you in my face.
I want you to leave.

48:12.141 --> 48:14.352
- What do you need to think about?
- Bobby, get out-
- I'm telling you it's bullshit-
- Get out-

48:14.519 --> 48:17.188
Just leave, so I can think-
For me, okay? Just leave.

48:17.355 --> 48:21.901
Just go, Bobby. Go. Go.

48:24.946 --> 48:27.990
- You want a blend?
- Yeah.

48:28.157 --> 48:30.910
Thanks.

48:37.208 --> 48:41.212
- Hi.
- Hi. Uh, I'd like to have a room
for the evening, please.

48:41.379 --> 48:44.674
Okay. Thank you.

48:48.261 --> 48:52.390
-I'm sorry, sir. This card was declined.
-Declined? This is a brand-new card.
Try it again, please.

48:52.557 --> 48:55.601
Yes, sir.

48:57.144 --> 48:59.939
You know, maybe it's
not activated yet.

49:00.106 --> 49:02.817
Thank you.
Run this one, please. Thank you.

49:02.984 --> 49:05.862
Yes, sir.

49:06.028 --> 49:08.573
No, it didn't go through.

49:08.739 --> 49:10.616
- But I'll try it again.
- N-No, thank you.

49:12.410 --> 49:14.871
- My briefcase is gone.
- Excuse me, sir?

49:15.037 --> 49:17.707
- My briefcase was right here.
- Are you sure you brought it in?

49:17.832 --> 49:20.626
Yes, I'm sure I brought it in-

49:24.338 --> 49:27.800
Hi. This is Rachel.
Leave a message after the beep.

49:27.967 --> 49:30.428
Hey, Rachel, it's Bobby.
Uh, I need to talk to you...

49:30.595 --> 49:32.680
and I need to talk to you
face-to-face.

49:32.847 --> 49:37.059
Uh, meet me tomorrow, 11:00 a.m.,
Mount Vernon Square. I'll see you then.

49:38.561 --> 49:40.646
Yes.

49:50.156 --> 49:51.908
All right, we're moving into
phase two of the training op.

49:52.074 --> 49:55.119
Selb's gonna brief you on it,
so listen up, all right?

49:55.286 --> 49:57.205
We're gonna be following
the subjects through the square.

49:57.371 --> 50:01.584
We're gonna have three listening
stations and two video surveillance
units with unidirectional mikes.

50:01.751 --> 50:04.754
Pratt, you're three.
Jones, Fiedler, Krug...

50:04.921 --> 50:07.173
you guys are at ground level.
You'll be following the targets.

50:07.340 --> 50:09.467
You move when I say,
you go when I say.

50:09.634 --> 50:12.053
All handoffs go on my command.

50:12.220 --> 50:14.889
Now, for the uninitiated,
if we don't have line-of-sight...

50:15.014 --> 50:17.683
we can't hear
what they say, right?

50:17.850 --> 50:19.936
- Right?
- Yeah. Got it.

50:20.102 --> 50:23.105
- All right. You guys clear?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

50:23.272 --> 50:25.441
Jones, Krug, what, are you guys
from communications?

50:25.608 --> 50:28.528
- No, we're ops.
- You can tell by their haircuts.

50:36.744 --> 50:39.956
I would like to sit down
with Mr Pintero in private...

50:40.122 --> 50:41.958
so he and I can discuss
what's happening to me.

50:42.124 --> 50:44.168
I called; they said he was here.

50:44.335 --> 50:46.838
Mr Pintero would like to help you.

50:49.465 --> 50:52.009
- But he won't.
- And why not?

50:52.176 --> 50:54.554
Well, because first, you haven't
told him who made the tape...

50:54.720 --> 50:59.934
and second, we've spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars...

51:00.101 --> 51:02.353
on shyster lawyers just like you...

51:02.520 --> 51:06.941
because of shyster lawyers
just like you.

51:08.067 --> 51:10.528
Actually, I believe
the slur "shyster"...

51:10.695 --> 51:13.865
is generally reserved
for Jewish attorneys.

51:14.031 --> 51:16.951
I believe the proper slur
for someone like myself...

51:17.118 --> 51:19.328
would be, uh, "eggplant."

51:19.495 --> 51:22.582
Boom. This kid gets brighter
every time I see him.

51:28.504 --> 51:32.049
- You said 11:00 sharp.
- I know. Uh, Christmas
traffic is horrible.

51:34.260 --> 51:39.515
You know, it's not so smart, us being
seen together in public like this.

51:39.682 --> 51:42.935
- Do we have anything to hide?
- Heavy background on one.
Could we do better on audio two?

51:43.102 --> 51:46.063
- Unfortunately not.
- Two is better.

51:46.230 --> 51:48.191
IRS contacted me this morning.

51:48.357 --> 51:52.737
- Two, you're good. Hold position.
- They say my lifestyle
exceeds my income.

51:52.904 --> 51:54.947
Ohh. You're being audited?

51:55.114 --> 51:58.826
For the last four years.
What's going on, Bobby?

51:58.993 --> 52:03.206
Uh, look, don't worry about that.
W-- My firm will represent you
completely free of charge.

52:03.372 --> 52:07.668
- Eighty percent.
- You don't work there
any more, remember?

52:07.835 --> 52:10.922
- It's a temporary situation.
- Your 80's becoming a 20.
- Bullshit.
- Move to audio three.

52:11.088 --> 52:14.008
- On three. Much better. Much better.
- We're screwed.

52:14.175 --> 52:16.636
- Wake up, one.
- We are out.

52:19.138 --> 52:22.183
Rachel, I'm going to fix this.

52:22.350 --> 52:24.227
- How?
- Tell me about Brill.

52:24.393 --> 52:28.272
- Did he say "Bill"?
- No, "Brill," with an "R."
- I can't do that.

52:28.439 --> 52:31.192
- Cross-reference Rachel's file.
See if the name "Brill" comes up.
- Got it.

52:31.359 --> 52:35.530
Rachel, don't you see that he is
the key to this whole mess?

52:35.696 --> 52:38.658
From the second you gave me that tape,
my life has been falling apart.

52:38.825 --> 52:40.952
You assured me
that this-this guy was legit.

52:41.118 --> 52:44.622
- You needed information;
I got it for you.
- Two, you're good. Hold position.

52:44.789 --> 52:48.584
- Three is good.
- This conversation is over.

52:50.795 --> 52:54.048
- Okay, here we go.
- What are you gonna do?
You gonna wander around--
- Two, you gotta do better.

52:54.215 --> 52:57.093
- Want your job back--
- Shit.
- Do you want your life back?

52:57.260 --> 52:59.929
I don't have a life.

53:00.054 --> 53:02.765
I'm in love with a married man.

53:08.229 --> 53:10.982
Okay, I have 'em on the bench.

53:11.149 --> 53:16.404
Rachel, I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can do about that.

53:16.571 --> 53:20.032
What makes you think it's you?

53:21.284 --> 53:24.620
It's not me?

53:24.787 --> 53:26.706
I j-- I just as-assumed from--

53:26.873 --> 53:31.460
- You're a moron, you know that?
- Yes. I know.

53:36.007 --> 53:39.677
Rachel, you're gonna have
to tell me about Brill.

53:41.220 --> 53:43.306
Let's get outta here.

53:43.472 --> 53:45.975
All right. They're on the move.

53:46.142 --> 53:50.146
- Comin' to three.
- Stay with 'em.
- I got 40's, 20--

53:52.106 --> 53:55.067
- You're following through trees.
Two, can you track them?
- I lost line-of-sight.

53:55.234 --> 53:58.154
- Repeat, I have lost line-of-sight.
- Three, you've got nothing.

53:58.321 --> 54:02.950
- Lost line-of-sight. I'm out.
- We lost audio. It's gone. But we have
his tracers. We can still follow 'em.

54:03.117 --> 54:05.036
When I need to reach Brill, I--

54:05.203 --> 54:08.456
I chalk the mailbox
outside my house.

54:08.623 --> 54:11.667
When he crosses the mark,
I make the drop.

54:11.834 --> 54:15.838
The location's always the same--
same time, same place.

54:16.005 --> 54:19.258
3:00 p.m. ferry to Gibson Island.

54:19.425 --> 54:22.220
- You ever see him in person?
- He's the cautious type.

54:22.386 --> 54:25.765
He's not gonna like you
trackin' him down.

54:27.433 --> 54:29.519
The drop is behind seat 32.

54:29.685 --> 54:33.314
I leave something;
he picks it up later.

55:26.909 --> 55:30.955
I'm sorry it took so long. I had to
make sure you weren't being followed.

55:31.122 --> 55:33.541
- Brill.
- Brill's dead.

55:33.708 --> 55:36.878
Died of smallpox when he was two.
Buried in a field in Kansas.

55:37.044 --> 55:40.006
- What is that ?
- It's a bug-sweeper.

55:42.341 --> 55:44.844
- Take off your left shoe.
- What does it mean when--

55:45.011 --> 55:48.848
Take off your shoe. I don't have time to
explain. Take off your shoe right now.

55:49.015 --> 55:51.058
Come on.

56:00.193 --> 56:03.613
It's a beacon transmitter.
Thousand-yard range.

56:03.779 --> 56:05.990
They're close. Let's go.

56:07.366 --> 56:11.037
Who is "they"?

56:11.204 --> 56:13.873
And why are they puttin' things
in my shoes?

56:19.253 --> 56:22.048
No, get in the back,
like you're a customer.

56:28.054 --> 56:30.806
Everything's gone--
the wife, job...

56:30.973 --> 56:33.851
bank accounts, everything.

56:34.018 --> 56:36.604
You said Zavitz was behind
an extortion scheme?

56:36.771 --> 56:39.440
- No, they said it.
- You were the last one
that talked to him?

56:39.565 --> 56:43.569
- Yeah.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
He said, uh, "Help me, Bobby."

56:43.736 --> 56:47.156
- Help me with what?
- I don't know. We never got
around to that.

56:48.866 --> 56:52.036
- What did he give you?
- Nothing. He didn't give me anything.

56:59.710 --> 57:03.047
Listen, you gotta come clean.
If you bullshit me, I can't help you.

57:03.214 --> 57:06.467
- No- I'm tellin' ya,
he didn't give me anything. Nothing.
- A name? A phone number?

57:06.634 --> 57:10.137
No, nothing-
He didn't give me anything-

57:16.894 --> 57:19.730
- Who the hell is that?
- Oh, just somebody trying
to get our attention.

57:19.897 --> 57:22.775
Well, he's doing
a good job.

57:25.611 --> 57:28.406
Two-zero-nine to anybody.
I need help.

57:28.573 --> 57:31.784
- Who you calling?
I thought you worked alone.
- Just shut up a second.

57:49.218 --> 57:51.262
- Stay exactly where you are.
- Hey-

57:54.265 --> 57:56.809
Look what you did to my car-

58:04.192 --> 58:06.319
Shit-

58:14.327 --> 58:18.414
Okay, gentlemen, we have a subject
entering the structure on the
northeast corner of Chambers and Light.

58:18.581 --> 58:21.292
That's 105 Chambers Avenue.

58:21.459 --> 58:25.630
- Run a check on all six tracers.
- All six tracers are operative.

58:25.796 --> 58:28.758
- Call up geo-position.
- Yeah, I got it. No problem.
- Task keyhole their coordinates.

58:28.925 --> 58:33.471
All right. LAT, 39 degrees, 14 minutes.
LONG, 74 degrees, 39 minutes.

58:48.486 --> 58:51.280
- Hello.
- Carla, don't hang up on me.

58:51.447 --> 58:54.659
- Robert, do you know what
I'm looking at right now?
- Carla, listen.

58:54.826 --> 58:59.288
Photographs of you and Rachel
taken today. Is this true?

58:59.455 --> 59:02.333
Carla-- Carla, how did
you get the pictures?

59:02.500 --> 59:04.669
By messenger, Robert-
By messenger.

59:04.836 --> 59:07.880
- What does it matter?
- Look, all right, um--

59:08.172 --> 59:10.925
Some-- Something's going on.
I don't-- I don't know who it is.

59:11.092 --> 59:13.553
Robert,
I went to the store today...

59:13.719 --> 59:16.389
and my ATM and my credit cards
didn't work.

59:16.556 --> 59:19.225
- I know. Mine either.
- I couldn't buy food.

59:21.769 --> 59:25.022
- I gotta go.
- What do you mean you gotta go?

59:25.189 --> 59:28.526
- Carla-- Carla, I gotta-- I gotta go.
- Robert, wait a minute.

59:36.909 --> 59:39.036
Get on the fucking elevator.

59:45.543 --> 59:47.545
Oh, really?

59:52.758 --> 59:55.011
Got vertical movement here.

59:56.762 --> 59:59.223
Elevator.
He's in an elevator.

59:59.390 --> 01:00:02.727
- We're losing our tracking.
- Anybody got a visual?
- We need to move location
and get better signal.

01:00:02.894 --> 01:00:05.480
- I'm on it.
- Are you guys there yet?
- Negative.

01:00:17.074 --> 01:00:19.410
What the fuck is going on?

01:00:22.288 --> 01:00:26.250
- Shh.
- Wait. They stopped.

01:00:31.631 --> 01:00:35.134
Hold it.

01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:41.098
- I don't know what your problem--
- Shh.

01:01:00.827 --> 01:01:04.163
I'm getting high-frequency clutter.
We lost tracers one, two and six.

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:07.500
Their signals are completely dead.
Something is wrong here.

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:24.892
Get up.

01:01:27.061 --> 01:01:31.482
- Tracers three, four and five
are on their way up.
- He's getting help, boys.
He's getting help.

01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:35.153
We had an arrangement.
No contact. You broke the rules.

01:01:35.319 --> 01:01:37.989
They got to be heading for the roof.
Air One, we need to establish
visual on the rooftop...

01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:39.991
northeast corner,
Chambers and Light.

01:01:40.158 --> 01:01:42.827
Copy that. Rooftop,
northeast corner, Chambers and Light.

01:01:42.952 --> 01:01:46.247
Do you know how many federal agents
you had following you on that ferry?

01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:49.292
- I-I don't--
- Who are you working for?
- What are you talking about? I'm not--

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:52.503
Is that about me? Am I a target here?
Do they know me?

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:56.465
-Who is "they"?
-Do they know me?
-I don't know what you're talking about-

01:01:59.051 --> 01:02:01.762
You're either very smart
or incredibly stupid.

01:02:01.929 --> 01:02:04.056
Get off. Come on.

01:02:09.187 --> 01:02:12.482
- I got separating signals here.
- Tracer three is on its way down.
Four and five are still together.

01:02:12.648 --> 01:02:13.733
Where did he go?

01:02:13.983 --> 01:02:18.654
- How'd you find out about the ferry?
Who set that up for you?
- Rachel did. Who was that other guy?

01:02:18.821 --> 01:02:22.533
- What did he say, exactly?
- He said he was Brill.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.496
Did he say it or did you say it,
and he picked up on it? Come on. Think.

01:02:26.662 --> 01:02:29.832
- Shit, I said it.
- God damn it. You see,
that's why I have rules.

01:02:29.999 --> 01:02:33.044
- Is all this about Pintero?
- You think the mob
uses devices like this?

01:02:39.842 --> 01:02:43.679
-Excuse me, sir.
Where are your elevators?
-Right over there.
-In your phone was a GPS sat-tracker.

01:02:43.846 --> 01:02:46.265
- Pulse is at 24 gigahertz.
- I don't know what that means.

01:02:46.432 --> 01:02:49.560
It's like a Lo Jack,
only two generations better
than what the police have.

01:02:49.727 --> 01:02:52.897
- And what does that mean?
- Do you speak English?
- Obviously not that well.

01:02:53.064 --> 01:02:57.485
You're kind of a jerk, aren't you?
It means the NSA can read the time
off your fucking wristwatch.

01:02:57.652 --> 01:03:02.156
All right. Enough of this bullshit.
Right now, you either shoot me
or tell me what the fuck is going on-

01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:07.411
- Jones, you take the stairs.
- Krug, hold the perimeter.
Come in on my signal.

01:03:07.578 --> 01:03:10.248
The National Security Agency
conducts worldwide surveillance--

01:03:10.414 --> 01:03:12.750
fax, phones,
satellite communication.

01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:16.546
They're the only ones in the country,
including the military, who could
possibly have anything like this.

01:03:16.712 --> 01:03:19.465
- Why are they after me?
- I don't know, and I don't wanna know.

01:03:19.632 --> 01:03:23.302
Here they come. I thought these
sat dishes would scramble their signals.

01:03:23.469 --> 01:03:25.596
Control, this is Air One.
Repeat coordinates.

01:03:25.763 --> 01:03:27.723
105 Chambers Avenue.

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:30.643
You're transmitting.
They still have a signal on you.

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:33.771
Your collar, your belt, your zipper.
Get rid of your clothes.
All of them.

01:03:33.938 --> 01:03:38.568
- And then what am I supposed to do?
- Nothing. You live another day,
I'll be very impressed.

01:03:38.734 --> 01:03:42.905
- Two targets, rooftop, north side.
- Understood. Two targets, rooftop.
Maintain visual, please.

01:03:43.072 --> 01:03:45.741
- You have something they want.
- Look, I don't have anything-

01:03:45.908 --> 01:03:49.453
Maybe you do and you don't know it.
You stay away from Rachel
and you stay away from me.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.957
You come near either one of us, I'm
gonna kill you. Get rid of your watch.

01:03:53.124 --> 01:03:57.795
- My wife gave me this
for our anniversary.
- Then keep it. Stay off the phone.

01:04:06.262 --> 01:04:09.098
- Wait a minute. Either he just
committed suicide here--
- Or he learned to fly.

01:04:09.265 --> 01:04:12.560
- Air One, stay with him.
- Target's on the move.

01:04:12.727 --> 01:04:15.313
Satellite imagery
coming through.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.817
One metre res layering wireframe
coming your way. Over.

01:04:19.984 --> 01:04:21.944
Okay, gentlemen,
we're back on-line.

01:04:22.111 --> 01:04:24.447
Okay. Wireframe download complete.

01:04:24.614 --> 01:04:27.992
All right. We have a tracer
in the stairwell on 20 travelling down.

01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:30.161
Nineteen, eighteen...

01:04:33.122 --> 01:04:35.458
seventeen...

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:38.503
Moving up-

01:04:42.673 --> 01:04:45.176
He's out of the stairwell
on 17. Go to 17.

01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:53.518
Oh, shit.

01:05:06.614 --> 01:05:08.908
Shit. Mr Wu.

01:05:09.075 --> 01:05:11.828
- Target is holding on 17.
Zoom three Mag.
- Zooming.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.790
Mr Wu.

01:05:18.376 --> 01:05:20.962
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

01:05:21.128 --> 01:05:23.548
Hi. I'm from hotel hospitality
and evaluation.

01:05:23.714 --> 01:05:26.551
Oh, no, no. No tip. I'm fine.
Thank you. No tip.

01:05:26.717 --> 01:05:30.513
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I just wanna make sure that you folks
have absolutely everything you need...

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:34.267
- to be completely comfortable.
- I got something here.

01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:38.229
- We got him.
- Krug, Jones...

01:05:38.396 --> 01:05:40.439
get your asses up here
to the 17th floor right now.

01:05:40.606 --> 01:05:44.026
That's really important
to us here.

01:05:44.193 --> 01:05:47.822
- Mr Dean? I'd like to talk to you
for a second, if I could.
- Oh, shit.

01:05:47.989 --> 01:05:50.324
My clothes.

01:05:50.491 --> 01:05:54.704
- Shit-
- Yeah.

01:05:54.871 --> 01:05:56.789
Mr Dean?

01:06:01.043 --> 01:06:04.922
Mr Dean, if you could just come
to the door for a second, sir,
we could work this all out.

01:06:07.133 --> 01:06:09.802
I can't-- I got rabies or something.
I can't do it. I can't do it.

01:06:23.566 --> 01:06:25.776
Let's go.

01:06:35.453 --> 01:06:38.122
- Okay, that's our last tracer.
- Mr Dean-

01:06:38.247 --> 01:06:41.334
Let's not let this get out of hand.
Let's not involve
the hotel guests in this.

01:06:44.795 --> 01:06:46.797
Down, ma'am, sir.
Sit down. Please? Thank you. Thank you.

01:06:50.927 --> 01:06:54.305
-Door-
-Everything's gonna be all right, folks.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.311
Krug, balcony-

01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:04.023
Air One and Control, we got him.
He's dropped to the 16th floor.

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:07.652
Air One, visual support. Check
perimeter, south side of the building.

01:07:07.819 --> 01:07:10.530
Ten-four, Control.
We have visual.

01:07:17.286 --> 01:07:19.997
- He jumped to 15. Go to 15.
- Go-

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:25.419
Grab his clothes.

01:07:25.586 --> 01:07:29.006
Let's go, gentlemen.
Weapons away.

01:07:33.344 --> 01:07:36.305
Go-

01:07:37.473 --> 01:07:39.308
Move-

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:49.527
- Dean, open this door, God damn it-
- What are you doing? Come on-

01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:06.377
Dean, come on now-
We just wanna talk- Open this door-

01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:20.765
Open that door-

01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:30.734
- D.C. Metro.
Our partner's trapped inside.
- Yeah. We gotta evacuate this building-

01:08:37.073 --> 01:08:39.577
Control, Air One. We have
approaching emergency vehicles.

01:08:39.743 --> 01:08:43.788
Team, the show's going public,
and they're coming in the front door.
Stand down. Maintain visual perimeter.

01:08:43.956 --> 01:08:46.709
This is Air One.
We're outta here.

01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:54.300
We have a friend, Chavez,
on the 15th floor. We got one man
trapped and possibly down.

01:08:54.466 --> 01:08:56.761
Hey, there's a guy
trapped in there-

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:09.357
You're going to be okay, guy.
You're going to be all right.

01:09:13.778 --> 01:09:17.490
- Okay, we are travelling.
Known destination?
- St. Elizabeth's.
- St. Elizabeth's Hospital.

01:09:17.657 --> 01:09:20.243
- We need sat backup now.
- It's already done.

01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:33.923
Hey. Take it easy, guy.
You're going to be all right.
Just calm down. Okay.

01:09:36.341 --> 01:09:39.804
- Easy, fella.
- I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Stop the ambulance.

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:43.640
- Tell him to stop--
Tell him to stop it now-
- Pull over, George.
- Easy, fella.

01:09:47.103 --> 01:09:49.522
- He's getting out- He's getting out-
- Son of a bitch-

01:09:51.941 --> 01:09:54.777
He's escaped the ambulance and he's
on foot. But our guys are in pursuit.

01:09:54.944 --> 01:09:58.406
- Task keyhole their coordinates.
- All right.
LAT 39 degrees, 27 minutes.

01:09:58.573 --> 01:10:01.284
LONG, 74 degrees,
42 minutes.

01:10:04.495 --> 01:10:09.167
- Move, guys.
- Go, go, go- Damn it-
Go around- Go around-

01:10:16.382 --> 01:10:19.051
- You're on. Go.
- Tunnel Control, this is D.C. Metro.

01:10:19.177 --> 01:10:22.388
In pursuit armed felon loose
in tunnel. Requesting video help.

01:10:24.682 --> 01:10:29.645
Metro, this is Tunnel Control.
Yeah, we got a 20 on your suspect
heading south in tunnel six.

01:10:29.812 --> 01:10:31.731
Copy that.

01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:36.319
Yeah, we got him, we got him. He's right
in front of us. Uh, tunnel six.

01:10:36.486 --> 01:10:40.031
- He's heading south down tunnel six.
- I got him. I got him.
- He's got nowhere to go.

01:10:43.367 --> 01:10:46.537
He crossed over.
He's on the wrong side.

01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:52.543
Stop- Stop-

01:10:55.713 --> 01:10:58.716
We lost him. We lost him.
Son of a bitch- Pull over.

01:11:01.552 --> 01:11:05.056
- He's currently entering
vertical stairwell five.
- Where does that lead?

01:11:05.223 --> 01:11:08.184
Five leads to main access
to sub-ventilation tunnel.

01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:13.189
- Request closest vehicular access.
- Adjacent utility entrance, south side.
- Copy that.

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:17.276
Boys, he's in the ventilation tunnel.
Proceed to the adjacent utility
entrance on the south side.

01:11:17.443 --> 01:11:20.738
- There is no visual coverage.
- They got him- They got him-
He's in a ventilation tunnel-

01:11:20.905 --> 01:11:24.200
To the service entrance
at the south end- Come on- Let's go-

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.410
Come on- Go-

01:12:23.968 --> 01:12:27.513
- Normally, I wouldn't do this.
- Do you guys have him?
Talk to me, people.

01:12:38.983 --> 01:12:42.153
- Shit-
- Shit-

01:12:48.784 --> 01:12:50.703
I don't understand
why this is so difficult.

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.664
He shed the sensors. He's clever.
And he's had help.

01:12:53.831 --> 01:12:58.002
- Maybe it's the real Brill.
- There's 23 Brills
in the Baltimore/D.C. area.

01:12:58.169 --> 01:13:00.671
None of them check out. We're running it
through the EPIC computer now.

01:13:00.838 --> 01:13:04.008
- Do you think we're being set up?
- What, somebody in the agency?

01:13:04.175 --> 01:13:06.469
I don't know.

01:13:06.636 --> 01:13:10.681
It just tastes
a little off, doesn't it?

01:13:10.848 --> 01:13:14.143
- I know what you mean.
- Let's raise the stakes.

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:17.647
Make things a bit more serious for Mr
Dean. We'll both think about how, okay?

01:13:17.814 --> 01:13:19.690
Okay. Good.

01:13:25.488 --> 01:13:27.865
- Anything wrong?
- No.

01:13:30.785 --> 01:13:35.039
You know, you should have made deputy
director two years ago, maybe three.

01:13:35.206 --> 01:13:38.543
But it'll happen now. Once this bill
passes, that'll be it for you.

01:13:47.885 --> 01:13:49.804
Thanks, Maria.

01:13:58.479 --> 01:14:01.440
Porsche, what are you
barking at, boy?

01:14:13.077 --> 01:14:15.746
- Porsche?
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:14:15.913 --> 01:14:18.916
- Hey, it's me. It's me.
- I know it's you.
You scared the shit out of me.

01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:23.087
The house is bugged. Electronically.
Everything you say in there,
they can hear and maybe even see.

01:14:23.254 --> 01:14:25.298
Listen to me.
Listen, listen.

01:14:25.464 --> 01:14:28.926
I never-- I sw-- I swear to God.
I never-- Th-This is the truth.

01:14:29.093 --> 01:14:32.138
I never-- Ever since the problem,
I've never touched Rachel like that.

01:14:32.305 --> 01:14:36.309
I never-- I never even looked at her
like that, honey. I love you.

01:14:36.476 --> 01:14:40.313
I love you, and that is it.
That is it. Only you.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.275
- What about Eric?
- And Eric.

01:14:44.442 --> 01:14:47.778
And I love your family.
Except for your dad.

01:14:50.531 --> 01:14:53.743
I need you. I need you real bad.
I need you, okay?

01:14:57.038 --> 01:14:59.040
Okay.

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:02.835
I told you, Bobby.

01:15:03.002 --> 01:15:05.254
I told you they had
this type of capability.

01:15:05.421 --> 01:15:08.925
And that goddam privacy bill
is just another way for them
to expand the power.

01:15:09.091 --> 01:15:11.886
- Shh.
- Don't you "shh" me.

01:15:14.472 --> 01:15:18.935
You were right. I was wrong.
But this is not the time
for the "I told you so" speech.

01:15:19.101 --> 01:15:22.855
That day when Daniel Zavitz got hit
by the fire truck, he was running.
H-He was scared.

01:15:23.022 --> 01:15:26.442
The same people-- I know it now--
the people that were chasing him,
that's the people that are chasing me.

01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:29.987
- Bobby, are you serious?
- I need you to go to Philadelphia.
Stay there with your family.

01:15:30.154 --> 01:15:33.032
- Ju-Just give me time to work this out.
I'll get in touch with you.
- Oh, no. I don't think so.

01:15:33.199 --> 01:15:35.284
They're not chasing me
out of my house. Uh-uh, Bobby.

01:15:35.451 --> 01:15:37.537
They're not chasing me--
I picked those drapes-

01:15:37.703 --> 01:15:41.123
Shh, shh.
Nobody cares about the drapes.

01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:43.835
Just one time can I make
some decisions around here? Please?

01:15:44.001 --> 01:15:47.380
Just go to Philadelphia.
I need you to do that for me, okay?

01:15:47.547 --> 01:15:50.633
- Okay.
- I miss you.

01:15:52.969 --> 01:15:55.179
Oh, God.

01:15:55.346 --> 01:15:58.474
Oh, I miss you so much.

01:16:00.601 --> 01:16:03.688
- You can't wear that.
That's a Christmas present.
- I know. I'm sorry.

01:16:03.855 --> 01:16:08.025
- But, baby, I missed you. I was lonely.
- How you just gonna go through
my stuff like that?

01:16:08.192 --> 01:16:11.154
Baby, until I actually give it to you,
that's still mine.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.865
Yeah, but it looks better on me,
don't you think?

01:16:15.825 --> 01:16:18.161
Baby, you're
as bad as Eric.

01:16:18.327 --> 01:16:21.497
I missed you so much.

01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:27.253
- What?
- Oh, shit. That was the night.

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:30.256
That was the night
that I came home with the presents.

01:16:30.423 --> 01:16:32.633
- Where is Eric?
- He's at Dylan's house.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.179
He's probably on the way to school.
What? What's going on?

01:16:36.345 --> 01:16:40.099
- What are you doing with that?
- Shh. Here, baby. Shh, shh.
- No, no. No. I don't want it.
I don't want it.

01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:43.686
- Take it. Take it.
- What do you want me to do with this?
- Get me some money. I need some
clothes. Put it away.

01:16:43.853 --> 01:16:46.397
- Okay. Okay.
- Tell Maria we need her car. Chances
are they wouldn't have bugged it.

01:16:46.564 --> 01:16:49.484
Oh, shit. Eric.

01:16:59.202 --> 01:17:02.371
Base, this is unit one.
The nanny is leaving. Please advise.

01:17:02.538 --> 01:17:05.416
Stay put. We have satellite tracking
and Bingham at the school.

01:17:14.759 --> 01:17:18.554
Aw, man, let me follow
the nanny.

01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:22.141
She doesn't shave
her legs. Jesus-

01:17:22.308 --> 01:17:24.560
Women like that
are so hot.

01:17:24.727 --> 01:17:27.772
- Is there anybody following us?
- No. No, Mr Bobby.

01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:30.650
All right.
Drive a little faster. I wanna
catch 'em before they get to school.

01:17:37.573 --> 01:17:40.117
- There they are.
- Pull up to them and tell them
to get into the car.

01:17:40.284 --> 01:17:42.954
Okay.

01:17:43.079 --> 01:17:45.456
Eric, Dylan,
get in the car, please.

01:17:45.623 --> 01:17:47.750
- No, we're okay.
- Get in the car right now.

01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:50.670
But school's right down the block.

01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:53.506
You heard me.
Now, get in.

01:17:57.385 --> 01:18:00.054
Come on-
Come on. Throw it-

01:18:04.559 --> 01:18:06.477
- What's up, fellas?
- Dad?

01:18:06.644 --> 01:18:09.021
No, no. Turn around.
Sit down. Face forward.

01:18:09.188 --> 01:18:11.274
- But, Dad--
- What did I say, Eric?

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.653
You guys both pick a spot
on those seats. We're gonna play a game.
You pick a spot and look right at it.

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.865
You can't let anyone know
I'm back here, okay?

01:18:19.031 --> 01:18:20.992
How you been, E.?
I missed you, man.

01:18:21.159 --> 01:18:23.619
I missed you, too, Dad.
Where did you go?

01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:28.666
Oh, they've been keeping me really busy
on this case. They're trying to work me
to death out there.

01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:32.336
- Are you and Mom getting a divorce?
- Face forward.

01:18:32.503 --> 01:18:35.339
What are you talking about?
No, we're not getting a divorce.

01:18:35.506 --> 01:18:38.551
I mean, so we, we had a little fight.
Sometimes married couples have fights.

01:18:38.718 --> 01:18:41.846
- That's nothing
for you to worry about.
- Who won the fight?

01:18:42.013 --> 01:18:45.183
This is your dad, Eric. You know
when I put my foot down, that's it.

01:18:45.349 --> 01:18:48.895
- My mom won.
- Look, I-I have a question
I need to ask you...

01:18:49.061 --> 01:18:52.190
and it is absolutely imperative
that you tell me the truth.

01:18:52.356 --> 01:18:56.194
Now, no matter what you say,
I swear to you, you are not
going to get in trouble.

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.237
- All right? You ready?
- Yeah.

01:18:58.404 --> 01:19:01.199
You remember that night I came home
with those Christmas presents,
and you asked me, could--

01:19:01.365 --> 01:19:05.953
I just looked in the bag, Dad.
I wouldn't have taken it,
except it was already open.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:11.209
All right, so we're clear.
But I need it. And I promise
I'll get you another one, Eric.

01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:15.046
- Dad.
- What's the matter?
- It's broken.

01:19:15.213 --> 01:19:18.382
It's not Eric's fault, Mr Dean.
It was always broken.

01:19:18.549 --> 01:19:20.885
The screen just scrambles
when you turn it on.

01:19:21.052 --> 01:19:24.722
- All right, but I need it, guys.
Do you have it here?
- Yeah, we have it.

01:19:24.889 --> 01:19:27.016
Eric, just pass it
around the side to me.

01:19:48.412 --> 01:19:51.749
Yes. Hello. Hi.
My name is Leon Newman.

01:19:51.916 --> 01:19:53.960
I'm sorry.
What's your name, ma'am?

01:19:54.126 --> 01:19:57.421
Sergeant Miller. Yes, we live
at 454 Beaumont Terrace.

01:19:57.588 --> 01:19:59.882
Actually, my mother lives there.
I'm calling for her.

01:20:00.049 --> 01:20:03.261
There's been a-a van sitting
outside all day, and...

01:20:03.427 --> 01:20:05.388
I'm not trying to get anyone
in trouble or anything like that...

01:20:05.555 --> 01:20:08.474
but, uh, I think they might be
doing drugs or-or something in there.

01:20:08.641 --> 01:20:10.601
I was hoping you
could send a car by.

01:20:12.395 --> 01:20:14.397
Thirty-one Allison,
all available units.

01:20:14.564 --> 01:20:19.777
Check out a white van at 454 Beaumont
for a possible 1031 narcotics violation.

01:20:19.944 --> 01:20:22.613
- Oh, eat me. That's us.
- Yep.

01:21:00.234 --> 01:21:02.236
Rachel.

01:21:02.403 --> 01:21:04.322
Rachel.

01:22:22.859 --> 01:22:26.028
Oh, shit.

01:22:55.349 --> 01:22:57.268
Open the door. Open the door-

01:23:17.663 --> 01:23:21.584
- All right, what happened?
- Rachel's dead.

01:23:26.964 --> 01:23:30.635
I told you not
to contact her. I told you.

01:23:35.848 --> 01:23:38.142
Get out of the car.

01:23:38.309 --> 01:23:43.272
- I think I found what they're
looking for. My son had it.
- Get out of the fucking car.

01:24:24.689 --> 01:24:26.607
Give me the toy.

01:24:36.284 --> 01:24:39.370
- You know why they killed her?
- Trying to make it look like it was me.

01:24:39.537 --> 01:24:42.623
They-- They had my stuff planted
all over her house.

01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:46.711
First, if you're a murder suspect,
you're gonna be easier to find...

01:24:46.878 --> 01:24:51.132
and second, to discredit you,
in case you ever go public against them.

01:24:51.299 --> 01:24:56.095
The NSA set you up.
It had nothing to do with Rachel.

01:24:56.262 --> 01:24:59.098
Absolutely nothing.

01:25:05.062 --> 01:25:08.065
- What do we got?
- We got nothing.

01:25:08.232 --> 01:25:10.193
All right. Pull up everything
we have on tape so far--

01:25:10.359 --> 01:25:12.528
the square,
the house surveillance.

01:25:12.695 --> 01:25:15.531
Van, give me the sat imagery
of the hotel roof.

01:25:15.698 --> 01:25:20.870
Okay, here. These are the parametrics
for the space vehicle
during data acquisition.

01:25:21.037 --> 01:25:23.581
Can we take a look at this guy
who's helping him? Who is he?

01:25:26.375 --> 01:25:28.294
Can you get a feature extraction
and pattern matching on him?

01:25:28.461 --> 01:25:31.130
Mm-mmm.
He never looks up.

01:25:31.297 --> 01:25:33.758
- He's smart.
- Why does he have to look up?

01:25:33.925 --> 01:25:37.929
The satellite's about
155 miles above the earth.
It can only look straight down.

01:25:38.095 --> 01:25:40.932
- That's kind of limited, isn't it?
- Well, maybe you can design a new one.

01:25:41.098 --> 01:25:43.643
Oh, maybe I will, idiot.

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:49.065
Stay put. I need some food.
I need to eat.

01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:52.068
Rockin' around the Christmas tree

01:25:52.235 --> 01:25:55.863
Let the Christmas spirit ring

01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:58.825
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie

01:25:58.991 --> 01:26:02.620
And we'll do some carolling

01:26:02.787 --> 01:26:05.122
You will get a sentiment--

01:26:08.793 --> 01:26:11.671
- Hello.
- Yeah, it's me.
- Oh, it's you, asshole.

01:26:11.838 --> 01:26:14.090
- What are you calling me for?
- Shut up and listen.

01:26:14.257 --> 01:26:17.385
Go to the house. Go.
Do not call Carla.

01:26:17.552 --> 01:26:21.264
Rachel Banks is dead. The papers will
make it sound like I killed her.

01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:23.641
Tell her that I didn't do it.

01:26:23.808 --> 01:26:27.520
Make sure she goes. Get her
out of there. Tell 'em I love 'em.

01:26:27.687 --> 01:26:33.317
The call is coming from 840 McClean,
Baltimore, between Hood and St. Anne's.

01:26:33.484 --> 01:26:36.070
Copy that. Yes-

01:26:54.881 --> 01:27:00.678
What's up, man? We're gonna have
to look at your surveillance tapes
for the last 20 minutes.

01:27:00.845 --> 01:27:04.849
- Hey, Larry-
- The surveillance footage
is coming in right now from Pratt.

01:27:05.016 --> 01:27:07.310
Freeze it and process it
for face recognition.

01:27:16.652 --> 01:27:19.489
Pratt, do we see
which way the car went?

01:27:19.655 --> 01:27:23.159
No, sir. This kid here at the register
thinks that it might have went south.

01:27:23.326 --> 01:27:29.707
Unfortunately, the shot's too tight.
I got make, uh, model and colour,
but the plates are phony.

01:27:29.874 --> 01:27:32.668
- Order satellite coverage
on this sector.
- It's already done.

01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:50.269
- You planning a quick getaway?
- Yeah, ever since I met you.

01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:17.463
Hate to see the chicken
that lives in this coop.

01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:22.426
This is where I work.
Might seem strange to you, but this
has been my office for 15 years.

01:28:22.593 --> 01:28:27.974
It's completely secure. Copper wire mesh
keeps the radio signals out.

01:28:31.602 --> 01:28:35.064
This is the satellite imagery
of the convenience store 20 minutes ago.

01:28:35.231 --> 01:28:37.984
- They're in an EI Camino.
- Eighty-six.

01:28:40.319 --> 01:28:45.783
- There it is.
- John, give us LAT 30, 64 minutes,
LONG 72, 29 minutes.

01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:49.996
- That's affirmative.
- There they are.

01:28:50.163 --> 01:28:52.373
It's coming in from top left.

01:28:54.959 --> 01:28:56.919
Let's go in there and get them.

01:29:00.548 --> 01:29:04.469
I call it the jar.
No phone or utility lines coming in.

01:29:04.635 --> 01:29:07.346
Self-contained.
Unplugged from the world.

01:29:07.513 --> 01:29:09.932
Nothing for a wire bug
to piggyback in on.

01:29:10.099 --> 01:29:14.312
That leaves only transmitters. It's
easy enough to signal-sweep for those.

01:29:14.479 --> 01:29:18.191
Signal-sweeping for transmitters.
You're just a party animal.

01:29:20.026 --> 01:29:24.697
See, the government's been in bed
with the entire telecommunications
industry since the '40s.

01:29:24.864 --> 01:29:28.034
They've infected everything. They
can get into your bank statements...

01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:32.663
your computer files, your e-mail,
listen to your phone calls.

01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:37.460
- My wife's been saying that for years.
- Every wire, every airwave.

01:29:37.627 --> 01:29:42.340
The more technology you use, the easier
it is for them to keep tabs on you.

01:29:42.507 --> 01:29:47.220
It's a brave new world out there.
At least it better be.

01:30:04.028 --> 01:30:08.950
There it goes.
It's some kind of simple encryption.

01:30:09.116 --> 01:30:11.869
Oh, conspiracy theorists
of the world, unite.

01:30:12.036 --> 01:30:14.956
It's more than a theory with me.
I'm a former conspirer.

01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:20.419
Yeah, I used to work for the NSA.
I was a communication analyst.

01:30:20.586 --> 01:30:22.922
Listen to international calls,
calls from foreign nationalists.

01:30:23.089 --> 01:30:26.050
That GPS tracking device we found
in your cellular telephone?

01:30:26.217 --> 01:30:29.428
I designed one of the first models
in that series.

01:30:37.019 --> 01:30:42.275
Fort Meade has 18 acres
of mainframe computers underground.

01:30:42.441 --> 01:30:46.737
You're talking to your wife
on the phone and you use the word
"bomb," "president," "Allah"...

01:30:46.904 --> 01:30:49.448
any of a hundred key words,
the computer recognizes it...

01:30:49.615 --> 01:30:51.826
automatically records it,
red-flags it for analysis.

01:30:51.993 --> 01:30:54.495
That was 20 years ago.

01:31:00.459 --> 01:31:02.670
You know the Hubble Telescope
that looks up at the stars?

01:31:02.837 --> 01:31:07.258
They've got over a hundred spy
satellites looking down at us.
That's classified.

01:31:07.425 --> 01:31:10.553
In the old days, we actually had
to tap a wire into your phone line.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.890
Now calls bouncing off satellites,
they snatch 'em right out of the air.

01:31:17.226 --> 01:31:18.895
What's this?

01:31:24.734 --> 01:31:27.778
- That's Phil Hamersly.
- Jesus Christ.

01:31:36.662 --> 01:31:40.208
Who's this guy? I'm gonna check
the executive NSA files.

01:31:40.374 --> 01:31:43.169
Let's run a photo ID on him.

01:31:53.846 --> 01:31:56.766
Reynolds, Thomas Brian.
Born 9-11-40.

01:31:56.933 --> 01:32:00.812
Attended Episcopal School, D.C.
B.A., Harvard, PhD, Princeton.

01:32:00.978 --> 01:32:03.648
On loan from the State Department
since '95.

01:32:03.773 --> 01:32:06.108
This guy's not a professional.
He's a politician.

01:32:10.947 --> 01:32:14.283
Aw, shit- Take that.

01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:17.620
- When was the last time
you contacted somebody you knew?
- When we stopped for food.

01:32:17.787 --> 01:32:20.832
- Didn't I tell you
not to use the telephone?
- I called from a pay phone.

01:32:20.998 --> 01:32:24.377
- What did I tell you?
- You told me no calls.

01:32:24.544 --> 01:32:26.963
I told you no calls.

01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:31.050
- Get the cat. Get the cat.
- Hey, man--

01:32:31.217 --> 01:32:33.386
- What's the cat's name?
- Babe.

01:32:33.553 --> 01:32:37.640
Come here, baby. Come here, baby.
Baby, come, come. Come here-

01:32:45.022 --> 01:32:47.358
Shit-

01:32:50.361 --> 01:32:52.405
God damn it.

01:33:02.665 --> 01:33:04.917
All right, baby,
what do we got?

01:33:07.712 --> 01:33:10.173
What the--

01:33:18.139 --> 01:33:22.393
- Subjects exiting.
- Williams, get the hell out of there.

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:26.814
This bitch is gonna blow-
Go, go, go- Move-

01:33:43.915 --> 01:33:46.584
Come on- Go-

01:33:50.588 --> 01:33:53.257
Move- Move- Move-

01:34:00.598 --> 01:34:02.391
Move- Move-

01:34:13.236 --> 01:34:15.238
- What the hell is happening?
- I blew up the building.

01:34:15.404 --> 01:34:17.615
- Why?
- Because you made a phone call-

01:34:27.792 --> 01:34:30.503
- Tell him to pull over-
- Pull the vehicle over now-

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.969
Pull over now-

01:34:53.651 --> 01:34:55.820
Pump action-

01:35:13.379 --> 01:35:16.340
Gosh damn-

01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:22.722
Fuel line must be broken.

01:35:22.889 --> 01:35:25.808
- Get it out- Get it out- Goddam-
- Stop the car-

01:35:34.734 --> 01:35:37.320
- Where's the disk?
- Shit-

01:35:37.487 --> 01:35:41.741
No- Shit-
Look, is there any way to save it?

01:35:41.908 --> 01:35:44.911
- Ah, that's ruined.
- What do we do?

01:35:45.077 --> 01:35:47.663
- I'm leaving.
- Subjects heading west
across the coal fields.

01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:51.918
- What do you mean you're leaving?
- The disk is gone.
We got nothing. It's over.

01:36:04.347 --> 01:36:07.183
We have control.
Put down your weapons.

01:36:15.066 --> 01:36:18.861
You think I wanted that disk?
You think I wanted that idiot
to put that goddam thing in my--

01:36:19.028 --> 01:36:24.075
Who gives a fuck what you wanted?
Since you've shown up, Rachel's dead
and the NSA's onto me.

01:36:28.079 --> 01:36:31.290
Onto you? What do you mean onto you?
Onto you about what, Brill?

01:36:31.457 --> 01:36:33.793
You're not the target.
I am.

01:36:45.763 --> 01:36:48.516
This time we got him. We got him.
He's right in front of us.

01:36:51.185 --> 01:36:53.688
Come on, come on.

01:36:55.148 --> 01:36:58.359
We got him.
He's got nowhere to go. We got him.

01:37:08.953 --> 01:37:11.497
Air One to ground,
they're somewhere between the trains.

01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:15.209
Get the fuck away from me.

01:37:16.836 --> 01:37:20.506
- Damn it-
- We're coming back around.

01:37:20.673 --> 01:37:23.426
- You're blowing my whole life.
- What life?

01:37:23.593 --> 01:37:26.471
You live in a fucking jar
so the world can't touch you.

01:37:26.637 --> 01:37:31.309
And Rachel-- You didn't give a shit
about Rachel- Just some package
under seat number 32 to you.

01:37:34.145 --> 01:37:37.940
- Come on-
- Do you have a problem?
- Do it- Go on- Do it-

01:37:39.233 --> 01:37:42.528
I'm all you've got-
And you're all I've got.

01:37:50.536 --> 01:37:53.498
Got 'em.
Heading west towards the freeway.

01:38:03.883 --> 01:38:06.803
- Get out of the fucking car- Get out-
- All right.

01:38:06.969 --> 01:38:09.806
- Come on. Get out. Move.
- Don't do this to me. Come on.

01:38:09.972 --> 01:38:13.851
- Tell your story walking.
- Hey, wait a minute. Don't--
Oh, for God's sakes--

01:38:14.018 --> 01:38:16.854
-Thanks for your help back at the train.
-Wait a minute.

01:38:18.898 --> 01:38:20.858
Oh, for Jesus--

01:38:21.025 --> 01:38:23.069
Air One to ground,
I think we lost them.

01:38:23.319 --> 01:38:25.655
They're somewhere beneath the overpass.

01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:38.459
Well, you certainly carjacked
a really nice car.

01:38:38.626 --> 01:38:41.963
This is a piece of shit.
What are you talking about?

01:38:44.006 --> 01:38:49.053
- I need sugar, you know.
I'm-I'm getting cranky.
- Getting?

01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:52.473
I'm hypoglycaemic. Uh, my body
can't metabolize the sugar, so--

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:55.560
So you're a real, you know,
pain in the ass when you don't eat.

01:38:55.726 --> 01:38:57.812
Basically.

01:38:57.979 --> 01:39:00.064
Yeah. Right.

01:39:00.231 --> 01:39:03.234
- We should eat then.
- Let's do that.

01:39:04.402 --> 01:39:09.782
His real name is Edward Lyle.
Graduated from Drexel University.
Enlisted in the army, 1953.

01:39:09.949 --> 01:39:15.037
Rapid promotion, excelled
at intelligence and communications.
Joined NSA in '65.

01:39:15.204 --> 01:39:20.334
- Of course.
- Yeah. He was in the agency till 1980,
when he vanished and went underground.

01:39:20.501 --> 01:39:23.921
- Hasn't been seen since.
- That's a long time.

01:39:24.088 --> 01:39:26.549
Lots of black bags,
lots of deleteds.

01:39:26.716 --> 01:39:29.427
He's familiar
with explosives, obviously.

01:39:29.594 --> 01:39:33.473
His last assignment, he went into Iran,
late '78, after the Shah.

01:39:33.639 --> 01:39:37.685
- This is our problem.
- This man.

01:39:39.854 --> 01:39:44.108
So, we were helping
the secret police supply weapons...

01:39:44.275 --> 01:39:46.402
to the Afghani rebels
fighting the Soviets.

01:39:46.569 --> 01:39:51.115
My partner and I were
on the eastern border monitoring
Soviet military transmissions.

01:39:51.282 --> 01:39:55.036
It was kind of fun, actually.
I liked the Iranians.

01:39:55.203 --> 01:39:57.914
But back in Tehran,
the hard-liners seized the embassy...

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.666
and overnight,
the whole country changed.

01:40:00.833 --> 01:40:04.462
People we'd been working with,
they turned on us. I got out.

01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:06.839
My partner didn't.

01:40:07.006 --> 01:40:10.802
By the time I got home,
the whole mission had become
a press disaster waiting to happen.

01:40:10.968 --> 01:40:13.262
Aiding and abetting
the new enemy.

01:40:13.429 --> 01:40:16.599
The agency conveniently
forgot I existed.

01:40:17.975 --> 01:40:22.522
I don't blame them.
It's what they had to do.

01:40:22.688 --> 01:40:25.942
I loved the agency.

01:40:26.108 --> 01:40:29.362
I loved the work.
I loved the people.

01:40:29.529 --> 01:40:32.323
It was my whole life.

01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:34.909
Your partner
was Rachel's father.

01:40:35.076 --> 01:40:39.413
Yeah. The idea was--

01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:43.292
The idea always was that if one
of us got out, he'd take care
of the other's family.

01:40:44.752 --> 01:40:48.422
Rachel was all he had, so she became
my promise to him.

01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:51.342
- Here you go, hon.
- Thank you.

01:40:55.972 --> 01:40:58.182
Maybe we can still keep
that promise in a way.

01:40:58.349 --> 01:41:01.394
You're a threat now,
just like I was.

01:41:01.561 --> 01:41:04.063
Threat to whom? To them?

01:41:04.230 --> 01:41:06.941
To your family, to your friends,
everyone you know, everyone you meet.

01:41:07.108 --> 01:41:11.612
That's why I went away and didn't
come back. You gotta go away, Robert.

01:41:11.779 --> 01:41:14.448
No, I don't think so.
This is my life.

01:41:14.615 --> 01:41:17.785
I worked hard for it,
and I want it back.

01:41:17.952 --> 01:41:23.291
I grew up without a father. I know what
that is. And I will not allow my family
to go through that.

01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:26.878
Mommy, I don't wanna
go home.

01:41:34.177 --> 01:41:37.430
Wanna take a poke at me? Come on.

01:41:37.597 --> 01:41:40.141
I don't hit senior citizens.

01:41:41.809 --> 01:41:44.312
Oh, come here, Babe. Come on. Hey.

01:41:44.479 --> 01:41:45.354
Come up here. Come on.

01:41:46.689 --> 01:41:50.651
You know, in guerilla warfare, you try
to use your weaknesses as strengths.

01:41:50.818 --> 01:41:53.237
- Such as?
- Well...

01:41:53.404 --> 01:41:59.285
if they're big and you're small,
then you're mobile and they're slow.

01:41:59.452 --> 01:42:01.037
You're hidden
and they're exposed.

01:42:01.913 --> 01:42:06.542
You only fight battles you know you can
win. That's the way the Vietcong did it.

01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:09.754
You capture the weapons and you use them
against them the next time.

01:42:09.921 --> 01:42:13.591
That way they're supplying you.
You grow stronger as they grow weaker.

01:42:15.218 --> 01:42:17.929
- Hey, try these.
- Can I have something else, please?

01:42:18.095 --> 01:42:20.348
- Yeah. Here.
- N-Never mind.

01:42:22.558 --> 01:42:26.395
- That's my best aloha shirt.
- Well, say "aloha" to it.

01:42:35.404 --> 01:42:39.158
- Steve, how you doing?
- Howdy.
- Need some gear.
- Help yourself.

01:42:39.325 --> 01:42:42.370
- Say hi to Bill.
- Hi, Bill.
- How you doing, Bill?

01:42:43.955 --> 01:42:46.290
Steve, where's the two gigahertz
video transmitters?

01:42:46.457 --> 01:42:48.835
Right behind you,
second shelf.

01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:51.671
Steve? I thought you said
his name was Bill.

01:42:51.838 --> 01:42:54.132
No. You're Bill.

01:42:54.298 --> 01:42:57.635
- If I'm Bill, you're going to have
to let me know I'm Bill.
- I just did.

01:42:57.802 --> 01:43:00.638
The, uh, president has not
committed himself...

01:43:00.805 --> 01:43:04.684
but he does recognize
that we do need something in this area.

01:43:04.851 --> 01:43:07.979
And I think he will come to see
that this bill will, in the end...

01:43:08.146 --> 01:43:11.149
provide the kind
of security that this--

01:43:11.315 --> 01:43:14.986
- What security?
- The kind of security he's gonna need.

01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:24.412
Ah, here we go. Modified cell phone
interfaced with laptop computer.

01:43:24.579 --> 01:43:27.623
- Creates an enormously powerful tool.
- What is that?

01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:32.587
This is Congressman Albert's
home address and his cellular ESN.

01:43:32.753 --> 01:43:35.882
Now, we reprogramme our phone...

01:43:36.048 --> 01:43:40.636
with Congressman Albert's ESN,
and you know what we got?

01:43:40.803 --> 01:43:43.139
Hi, sweetie. We just landed.
So, how are the kids?

01:43:43.306 --> 01:43:45.892
- Melissa has a fever.
- She okay?
- She's fine.

01:43:46.058 --> 01:43:48.978
- When will you have
some time to talk?
- Uh, about 30, 40 minutes.

01:43:49.145 --> 01:43:53.858
- I'll be in suite 59, Lincoln Hotel.
I'll call you when you get in.
- You're a dangerous man.

01:43:54.025 --> 01:43:57.236
Oh, shit.

01:44:00.198 --> 01:44:02.533
Aw, shit.

01:44:16.047 --> 01:44:18.216
- Say something.
- Excuse me?

01:44:18.382 --> 01:44:21.636
- Louder.
- What are you talking about?
- That's good.

01:44:24.013 --> 01:44:27.391
- Won't they look in there?
- That's the idea.

01:44:27.558 --> 01:44:30.520
Great plan.

01:44:30.686 --> 01:44:33.147
I've been a law-abiding citizen
my whole life. One day with you...

01:44:33.314 --> 01:44:37.068
I'm sh-shooting... and breaking--

01:44:37.235 --> 01:44:39.570
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:44:39.737 --> 01:44:42.657
- Rest well.
- Thanks. Bye.

01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:46.452
Good work, guys.

01:45:04.804 --> 01:45:07.223
We got him.

01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:10.143
Yeah, go for it,
Mr Congressman.

01:45:15.565 --> 01:45:19.026
- I think you're too young
to watch this part here.
- Yeah, so is she.

01:45:33.166 --> 01:45:35.835
Yeah, hello. Could you send somebody
up to my room, please?

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.379
Yes, this is Christa,
the congressman's aide.

01:45:38.546 --> 01:45:41.591
- Might be able to piggyback it
on top of this.
- How the hell am I supposed
to know what it is?

01:45:41.757 --> 01:45:44.719
I'm just a congressman,
for Christ's sake.

01:45:44.886 --> 01:45:50.433
Security expert tells me it's like
a-a PX-73 burst transmitter,
whatever the hell that is...

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:54.020
except it's-it's
much, much more sophisticated.

01:45:54.187 --> 01:45:58.149
Of course I'm going to send it down,
but that's-- That's not the--

01:45:58.316 --> 01:46:00.985
Because I want to know
who in the hell put it there, Jim.

01:46:12.663 --> 01:46:15.166
- Hi there. Hey.
- Hola. Si?

01:46:32.225 --> 01:46:37.355
- The category, Barbara.
- You know, this is very irritating.
Get one channel and stay with it.

01:46:40.525 --> 01:46:43.027
- Stop jumping--
- We're on TV-

01:46:43.194 --> 01:46:46.239
- I told you to stop jumping around.
- We're on TV-

01:47:02.588 --> 01:47:06.384
Okay, these are the ones
they wanted us to find.

01:47:06.551 --> 01:47:09.303
They're all ours.
We made 'em.

01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:12.265
Thomas, could
I see you a second?

01:47:17.228 --> 01:47:21.399
Look, there's $140,000 here.
I have no idea where it came from.

01:47:21.566 --> 01:47:25.403
- What are you talking about?
An extra 140?
- Yeah.

01:47:25.570 --> 01:47:27.905
Look, it's right here.

01:47:28.072 --> 01:47:31.200
Two separate $70,000 deposits
on the same day.

01:47:31.367 --> 01:47:33.578
Yes, I see the deposits,
thank you.

01:47:33.744 --> 01:47:36.956
- What I'm saying is
I have no idea where they came from.
- Tom.

01:47:37.123 --> 01:47:41.461
I'm sorry. That was Shaffer. He wants
to see all department heads at 0800.

01:47:43.671 --> 01:47:46.507
You're going in on Sunday.

01:47:46.674 --> 01:47:49.343
- That's just great.
- Emily.

01:47:50.595 --> 01:47:52.763
This is your separate account.
I have no idea--

01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:55.349
By the way, who is Christa?

01:47:58.352 --> 01:48:00.771
"Eternally yours"?

01:48:03.733 --> 01:48:07.695
I want the entire history
of this device, from birth to abortion,

01:48:07.862 --> 01:48:11.240
on my desk in two hours.

01:48:11.407 --> 01:48:14.452
I want the name
of the tech who made it.

01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:21.000
I want to know
who authorized its use...

01:48:21.167 --> 01:48:23.920
who checked it out
from inventory...

01:48:24.086 --> 01:48:26.672
and for what purpose.

01:48:29.467 --> 01:48:32.720
Most important,
how on God's green earth...

01:48:32.887 --> 01:48:35.932
it got into Congressman Albert's
hotel room.

01:48:36.098 --> 01:48:38.810
Listen, people, everyone here knows
where this is going.

01:48:38.976 --> 01:48:43.439
Now, if this was a legit op--

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:49.737
If this was a legit op...

01:48:49.904 --> 01:48:53.658
and I can't possibly see
how it could be, then so be it.

01:48:56.077 --> 01:49:00.748
But if this was somebody's
unilateral wet dream...

01:49:00.915 --> 01:49:03.334
then that somebody
is going to prison.

01:49:05.545 --> 01:49:07.380
It's him.

01:49:10.258 --> 01:49:13.427
- Yes?
- Thomas Reynolds?

01:49:13.594 --> 01:49:17.014
- Who is this?
- I have that environmental study
you've been looking for.

01:49:19.267 --> 01:49:24.147
- Can we discuss this in person?
- Be at the corner
of Iowa and Third at 3:00.

01:49:24.313 --> 01:49:27.400
I'll be there at 4:00.

01:49:28.651 --> 01:49:30.903
We have to get a confession out of
this guy, we have to...

01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:33.823
get it on tape, and we have
to get it fast, okay?

01:49:36.826 --> 01:49:41.038
Oh, you shouldn't have. This thing
must've cost 12, 13 bucks easy.

01:49:41.205 --> 01:49:43.708
Now, they expect me
to be wired, all right?

01:49:43.875 --> 01:49:45.960
So what they'll do
is they'll sweep me.

01:49:46.127 --> 01:49:49.797
But once they're done,
I'm gonna give you the signal...

01:49:49.964 --> 01:49:52.216
- and, uh, you turn the mike on.
- What's the signal?

01:49:52.383 --> 01:49:55.094
Signal is putting, uh, gum in my mouth.

01:49:55.261 --> 01:49:58.389
So after the signal, you turn
the mike on. T-Turn it on now.

01:49:58.556 --> 01:50:02.059
- Let's try it.
- Okay, off. Off.

01:50:02.226 --> 01:50:05.730
Good. Now, to be safe,
they'll also try...

01:50:05.897 --> 01:50:08.608
to scan all the frequencies
to try to track you down.

01:50:08.774 --> 01:50:12.111
Now, if these guys are good,
and they're probably very good,
in a location like this...

01:50:12.278 --> 01:50:14.197
they'll have you
in five, six minutes.

01:50:14.363 --> 01:50:18.367
So let's say in four minutes time,
after you turn that tape on...

01:50:18.534 --> 01:50:21.120
regardless of what's happening,
you get out that door.

01:50:21.287 --> 01:50:24.081
- Now, you got that?
- No.

01:50:39.096 --> 01:50:43.184
Record. On-off.

01:50:43.351 --> 01:50:45.520
All right,
let the games begin.

01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:49.232
Hey there.

01:50:51.984 --> 01:50:55.530
Edward Lyle. Policeman.

01:50:55.696 --> 01:50:58.616
- Very clever.
- Why don't you call your friends over.

01:50:59.992 --> 01:51:02.078
Pratt.

01:51:07.708 --> 01:51:10.878
Step towards the fence for me.
This won't take a second.

01:51:17.093 --> 01:51:19.303
He's clear, sir.

01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:22.473
So, do you have the tape?

01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:26.102
- Yes, I have.
- Here?

01:51:26.269 --> 01:51:29.272
- No.
- Then what is there to talk about?

01:51:29.438 --> 01:51:33.943
- Money.
- Money?
- I was wondering why
I hadn't seen it on CNN.

01:51:34.110 --> 01:51:37.155
Have you looked at the tape?

01:51:37.321 --> 01:51:41.033
- What's on it?
- Your ugly-ass face is on it.

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:44.245
It shows the death
of Congressman Hamersly.

01:51:44.412 --> 01:51:46.497
The needle behind the ear.

01:51:46.664 --> 01:51:50.168
- Three faces, readily identifiable.
- How much you want for it?

01:51:50.334 --> 01:51:53.171
- 1.8 million dollars.
- What?

01:51:53.337 --> 01:51:56.174
And my file cleared.
I want my life back.

01:51:56.340 --> 01:52:00.178
My 1980 salary with cost-of-living
increases for the past 18 years.

01:52:00.344 --> 01:52:04.474
- Plus interest.
- Oh, shit.
- Plus the retirement package
for executive level E-16.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:07.393
Comes to 1.85.
I rounded it down.

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:10.146
And for this,
I get the tape and, uh, Mr Dean.

01:52:10.313 --> 01:52:13.357
- Actually, it's Dean that has the tape.
- Aw, shit.

01:52:13.524 --> 01:52:17.111
- So what does he want?
- He wants to know
why you killed the girl.

01:52:17.278 --> 01:52:21.866
- What girl you talking about?
- I tried to explain it to him,
but I couldn't figure it out myself.

01:52:22.033 --> 01:52:25.203
You're getting self-righteous on me?
Because I've seen your file.

01:52:25.369 --> 01:52:28.039
- Not exactly a beacon of light.
- Yeah, I agree.

01:52:28.206 --> 01:52:31.459
It's just that--
You kill Hamersly, okay.

01:52:31.626 --> 01:52:33.711
I wouldn't have,
but I understand the argument.

01:52:33.878 --> 01:52:37.965
But why the girl?
Just to get to some schmuck
who barely knows you're after him?

01:52:38.132 --> 01:52:41.969
- Schmuck?
- We never had to deal with domestic.
With us, it was always war.

01:52:42.136 --> 01:52:45.807
You won the war. Now we're fighting
the peace. It's a lot more volatile.

01:52:45.973 --> 01:52:48.893
Does he take this long
doing everything?

01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:53.564
Now we've got ten million crackpots
out there with sniper scopes,
saran gas and C-4.

01:52:53.731 --> 01:52:58.569
Ten-year-olds go on the Net, downloading
encryption we can barely break,
not to mention...

01:52:58.736 --> 01:53:01.405
- Aw, shit.
- instructions on how to make
a low-yield nuclear device.

01:53:01.572 --> 01:53:04.867
Privacy's been dead for 30 years
because we can't risk it.

01:53:05.034 --> 01:53:08.412
The only privacy that's left
is the inside of your head,
and maybe that's enough.

01:53:08.579 --> 01:53:12.166
- Come on. Get him to say something.
- We've located subject.
Keep him talking.

01:53:12.333 --> 01:53:17.338
You think we're the enemy of democracy,
you and I? I think
we're democracy's last hope.

01:53:17.505 --> 01:53:21.050
- There's always going to be power.
- You shouldn't be there, Robert,
but if you are, get out.

01:53:21.217 --> 01:53:23.928
They're onto us.
Get out and follow procedure.

01:53:26.347 --> 01:53:28.266
Get out now, Robert.
Get out-

01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:49.954
- You gonna shoot a policeman
on the street? You wouldn't get a block.
- Get in.

01:53:55.501 --> 01:53:58.087
- Yeah?
- Tom?
- Emily, what is it?

01:53:58.254 --> 01:54:01.591
- Tom, our Visa card's been cancelled.
I tried to use--
- Did you try the American Express?

01:54:01.757 --> 01:54:04.302
-Yeah, I tried that, too, and it's not--
-Look, I-I-I can't deal with this
right now.

01:54:04.469 --> 01:54:06.554
- I'll call you back.
- Tom, listen, I-- No, Tom--

01:54:06.721 --> 01:54:11.559
Credit cards not working, huh?
Yeah, that can be a real
pain in the ass, can't it?

01:54:20.818 --> 01:54:22.695
Come in.

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.242
- Asshole.
- Great plan.

01:54:36.083 --> 01:54:40.171
Tell him
to give me the tape.

01:54:40.338 --> 01:54:44.258
- What guarantees do we have if--
- None.

01:54:44.425 --> 01:54:46.344
None?

01:54:46.511 --> 01:54:50.473
Does everybody here know that you
killed Phil Hamersly and Rachel Banks?

01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:53.935
This guy is going down, and he's going
to take all of you with him.

01:54:54.101 --> 01:54:59.607
Trust me on this. Amah- Goddam-
Oh, you son of a bitch- You--

01:54:59.774 --> 01:55:04.695
- Rachel Banks is not the issue.
- Oh, you bastard-
- Hamersly is the issue. He was killed
for a purpose. Now, where's the tape?

01:55:06.572 --> 01:55:09.242
Oh-- Oh, shit.

01:55:09.367 --> 01:55:11.828
Where's the tape?

01:55:13.746 --> 01:55:15.915
- Tom-
- All right. All right.

01:55:16.082 --> 01:55:18.751
- I'll-I'll give it to you.
- Thank you.

01:55:18.876 --> 01:55:22.380
What are you doing, you moron?
That's our only leverage-

01:55:22.547 --> 01:55:27.510
- For Christ's sake.
- I'm the moron? Me?
No, you're the moron-

01:55:27.677 --> 01:55:31.681
- Where is it?
- Washington and Fourth.
- Washington and Fourth.

01:55:39.355 --> 01:55:41.607
- That's my blender.
- So?

01:55:42.942 --> 01:55:45.194
Fourth and Washington.

01:55:51.450 --> 01:55:53.703
- Where is it?
- The restaurant.

01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:57.582
11169 Fourth Street.
Stand by to enter.

01:56:09.302 --> 01:56:11.179
Wait a second.

01:56:12.847 --> 01:56:15.224
See if you can get
the plate on that van.

01:56:15.391 --> 01:56:18.936
T-S-1-8-7-8-5.

01:56:19.103 --> 01:56:22.940
- You go in with Pratt and bring it out.
- I don't think so.

01:56:25.151 --> 01:56:29.322
- Oh, you don't think so?
- If I go in there
and I bring that tape out...

01:56:29.489 --> 01:56:31.407
I'm a dead man.

01:56:31.574 --> 01:56:34.535
We go together, you and me. And you
view the tape, you sign off on it.

01:56:34.702 --> 01:56:39.415
They let Brill go, and you take the tape
home. Everyone has a Merry Christmas.

01:56:39.582 --> 01:56:42.376
What assurances do I have
that you haven't copied that tape?

01:56:43.753 --> 01:56:47.256
You think I want copies? That tape has
been the bane of my existence.

01:56:47.423 --> 01:56:50.843
I wish the one that we have
was at the bottom of the Chesapeake.

01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:53.387
I wanna go home.

01:56:59.519 --> 01:57:03.314
- Give me a piece.
- Yes, sir.

01:57:04.649 --> 01:57:07.193
All right, you and me.

01:57:09.278 --> 01:57:12.782
And Pratt and Bingham.

01:57:12.949 --> 01:57:16.119
Fiedler, get one of those
little cameras on Bingham.

01:57:23.084 --> 01:57:26.546
Guess what.
It's a government vehicle. Shit-

01:57:26.712 --> 01:57:29.799
I'm going in cold. If I need you,
Hicks will call it.

01:57:34.804 --> 01:57:38.057
- You guys got some food
or something in here?
- Oh, behind you.

01:57:50.153 --> 01:57:54.907
You're either incredibly smart
or incredibly stupid.

01:57:55.074 --> 01:57:58.953
We'll see in a minute.
Watch out for the FBI.

01:58:06.502 --> 01:58:10.214
- I'll be back to get my blender.
- Yeah, I'll have it gift-wrapped.

01:58:14.051 --> 01:58:16.971
It's your show.

01:58:17.138 --> 01:58:20.433
- Isn't that the guy that was here
last time? That labour lawyer?
- You're right.

01:58:29.650 --> 01:58:32.111
- No, no. Thank you.
- You guys like the food?

01:58:32.278 --> 01:58:35.281
- Yeah. It's good food.
- It's good food, huh? I made it.

01:58:35.448 --> 01:58:37.950
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you made it.

01:58:38.117 --> 01:58:40.870
- Come on. Eat your food.
- I'm eating.

01:58:41.037 --> 01:58:44.624
- Boss.
- Huh?
- Black guy's back with a couple creeps.
- Yeah, sh-show him in.

01:58:51.672 --> 01:58:55.092
Hey, how you doing?

01:58:55.259 --> 01:58:57.512
What's this, the FBI?

01:58:57.678 --> 01:59:00.598
No, sir, Mr Pintero. This is
the gentleman you wanted to meet.

01:59:00.765 --> 01:59:04.101
- Oh, that's him?
- Yep, that's him.

01:59:04.268 --> 01:59:06.938
- So you made the tape?
- What?

01:59:07.063 --> 01:59:10.399
Did you make the videotape?

01:59:10.566 --> 01:59:13.319
Look, look. He wants it back.

01:59:13.486 --> 01:59:17.031
Really? I don't give a shit
what he wants.

01:59:20.118 --> 01:59:22.453
Could we have
some privacy, please?

01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:26.916
Yeah, maybe we should.

01:59:27.083 --> 01:59:29.961
- Maria, get the kids out of here.
- Come on, boys.

01:59:32.004 --> 01:59:34.173
Get 'em out of here.
Go on.

01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:38.886
Maria, come on- Get 'em out-
Come on- Uncle Paulie will take you
to the zoo later.

01:59:41.055 --> 01:59:44.350
- Ooh, ooh, Hicks.
- What the hell's the matter with him?

01:59:44.517 --> 01:59:47.353
No, no, no, no. Not on the equipment.
We gotta get him-- Okay.

01:59:56.737 --> 01:59:58.823
Check this out.
Come here.

02:00:00.283 --> 02:00:02.285
Tony, they just pulled
a guy out of the van.

02:00:02.452 --> 02:00:05.580
He's puking and bleeding
all over himself.

02:00:08.458 --> 02:00:12.253
Shit. It's a city cop.

02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:16.215
Hey, Babe. Come on. Come on.

02:00:16.382 --> 02:00:20.803
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Now, he's your friend.
You persuade him to give us the tape.

02:00:20.970 --> 02:00:25.725
Hey, look. Number one,
he's not my friend.

02:00:25.892 --> 02:00:28.769
- And number two, it's not his tape.
- Whose is it?

02:00:28.936 --> 02:00:32.273
It's mine, okay?
It's mine. I bought it.

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:34.942
You sold it to him?

02:00:38.571 --> 02:00:40.615
Now, you listen to me.

02:00:43.659 --> 02:00:46.788
Who are you? What the fuck
you trying to do to me?

02:00:46.954 --> 02:00:51.834
- Oh, this looks bad.
- I'm with the federal government.
- Oh, the federal government
made a videotape?

02:00:52.001 --> 02:00:54.879
- You guys oughta get in there.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Listen.

02:00:55.046 --> 02:00:58.633
Now, we can go get a warrant
and come back with the FBI,
take anything we want...

02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.928
arrest anybody that we want--
just give the man the videotape.

02:01:02.094 --> 02:01:05.056
Hey, only one gonna get arrested here
is you, for felonious cocksucking...

02:01:05.223 --> 02:01:07.642
with an attempt to swallow
the evidence, so shut your mouth.

02:01:07.809 --> 02:01:09.977
And you, get the fuck
out of here.

02:01:10.144 --> 02:01:12.605
Go get your warrant.
And until then, get out of my joint.

02:01:12.772 --> 02:01:15.733
Come on. You gotta get in there-
God, there are gonna be
dead bodies all over the--

02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:18.194
- Shut up-
- Get in there- Get in there- Come on.

02:01:18.361 --> 02:01:20.446
- Shit, forget it. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
- Okay.

02:01:20.613 --> 02:01:23.491
This is it-, This is it- Krug,
take the rear. Jamie, you're with us.

02:01:23.658 --> 02:01:26.119
Jones, you're on the side entrance.

02:01:26.285 --> 02:01:31.082
- So what are we waiting for?
Come on. Let's go-
- No. Tony says we wait
until they show up. We wait.

02:01:31.249 --> 02:01:34.001
- Put the guns away.
- You put your guns away.

02:01:34.168 --> 02:01:36.170
Put it away.
Put it away.

02:01:41.425 --> 02:01:43.636
Put it away.
Put it away.

02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:51.394
All right,
I'm putting it away.

02:01:56.649 --> 02:02:00.236
- Now, what will it take
for us to get that videotape?
- The end of the world.

02:02:04.323 --> 02:02:06.534
Let's go. We're leaving.

02:02:06.701 --> 02:02:09.745
- Put the guns down now.
- Everybody, drop your weapons-
- No-

02:02:42.278 --> 02:02:45.448
Go- Go- Go-
Out of the way- Out of the way-

02:02:52.497 --> 02:02:55.374
- Get your hands up.
- You get your hands up-
Drop the gun-

02:02:55.541 --> 02:02:58.294
- On your knees.
- Easy-Easy-Easy with this guy.
He's not one of them.

02:02:58.461 --> 02:03:01.297
Easy, easy. Get up. Get up.
Get up. Come on.

02:03:01.464 --> 02:03:05.343
- All right. Let's get
this place cleaned up.
- Not too stupid after all.

02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:08.888
Let's go.
Let's move it. Come on.

02:03:09.055 --> 02:03:11.265
Right there.
Somebody get the paramedics.

02:03:11.432 --> 02:03:14.560
We need some paramedics in here.
We have 13 bodies in here. Let's go.

02:03:27.114 --> 02:03:31.035
All right, listen up.
Get some IDs on these guys.
Let's get these guns out of here.

02:04:01.399 --> 02:04:04.652
This guy is going down.
He's going to take all of you with him.

02:04:04.819 --> 02:04:08.030
- Goddam-
- Rachel Banks is not the issue.

02:04:08.197 --> 02:04:11.909
Hamersly is the issue. He was killed
for a purpose. Now, where's the tape?

02:04:15.329 --> 02:04:18.583
- Why did you record it?
- Okay, uh...

02:04:18.749 --> 02:04:23.504
first of all, we were there for
technical support. And, uh,
we had no idea--

02:04:23.671 --> 02:04:26.883
- Do they know that Reynolds is dead?
- Yeah.
- They know all that?

02:04:27.049 --> 02:04:29.844
- Right, but they're still stalling.
- They're still stalling.

02:04:30.011 --> 02:04:32.263
- A tape.
- A tape of it.

02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:35.308
- What did you think was going on?
- Oh, I thought it was an STO.

02:04:35.475 --> 02:04:38.603
- STO?
- Standard Training Op.

02:04:43.065 --> 02:04:46.903
Congressman- Rhonda Overby, CNN.
Does this mean the privacy bill
is dead, Congressman?

02:04:47.069 --> 02:04:51.324
Uh, in its current form, yes,
but the issue is still
very much alive, I can assure you...

02:04:51.491 --> 02:04:54.577
unless, of course, no one worries
about national security any more.

02:05:04.003 --> 02:05:07.507
We knew that we had
to monitor our enemies.

02:05:07.673 --> 02:05:09.592
We also have come
to realize that we need...

02:05:09.759 --> 02:05:12.595
to monitor the people
who are monitoring them.

02:05:12.762 --> 02:05:16.224
Well, who's going to monitor
the monitors of the monitors?

02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:19.894
I wouldn't mind doing
a little, uh, monitoring myself.

02:05:20.061 --> 02:05:23.981
Mmm. Yeah, and you got lots
and lots of monitoring to do.

02:05:24.148 --> 02:05:27.527
Are you guys talking
about sex?

02:05:27.693 --> 02:05:29.904
- Boy--
- Oh, no. It's time for dinner.

02:05:30.071 --> 02:05:33.741
Get in there and eat your dinner.
No more hanging with Dylan.

02:06:08.151 --> 02:06:10.695
Brill, you are one sick man.

02:06:13.823 --> 02:06:15.992
Yeah, me too.

02:06:18.244 --> 02:06:21.664
Ooh, you're gonna need
to get a tan on those things.

02:06:26.294 --> 02:06:29.088
Congressman Sam Albert, how do we
draw the line-- draw the line...

02:06:29.255 --> 02:06:32.216
between protection
of national security...

02:06:32.383 --> 02:06:35.761
obviously the government's need
to obtain intelligence data...

02:06:35.928 --> 02:06:40.433
and the protection of civil liberties,
particularly the sanctity of my home?

02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:44.061
You've got no right
to come into my home.
