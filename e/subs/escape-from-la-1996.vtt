00:25.483 --> 00:28.694
(dramatic theme music)

02:29.065 --> 02:30.566
- [Narrator] In the late 20th century,

02:30.566 --> 02:34.611
hostile forces inside the
United States grow strong.

02:34.612 --> 02:38.490
The city of Los Angeles is
ravaged by crime and immorality.

02:39.408 --> 02:42.702
To protect and defend its
citizens, the United States

02:42.703 --> 02:44.204
Police Force is formed.

02:45.164 --> 02:48.375
A presidential candidate
predicts a millennium earthquake

02:48.376 --> 02:50.878
will destroy LA in divine retribution.

02:50.878 --> 02:52.838
- Like the mighty fist of God,

02:52.838 --> 02:56.049
Armageddon will descend upon
the city of Los Angeles,

02:56.050 --> 02:59.970
the city of sin, the city of
Gomorrah, the city of Sodom

02:59.970 --> 03:02.889
and waters will arise
and separate this sinful,

03:02.890 --> 03:06.560
sinful city from our country.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.730
- [Narrator] An earthquake measuring 9.6

03:09.730 --> 03:13.650
on the Richter scale hits at 12:59 PM,

03:13.651 --> 03:16.195
August 23 in the year 2000.

03:57.194 --> 04:00.238
After the devastation, the
Constitution is amended,

04:00.239 --> 04:01.657
and the newly-elected president

04:01.657 --> 04:03.825
accepts a lifetime term of office.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.996
The country's capital is
relocated from Washington, DC,

04:07.997 --> 04:11.417
to the President's home
town of Lynchburg, Virginia.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.420
Los Angeles island is
declared no longer part

04:14.420 --> 04:17.798
of the United States, and
becomes the deportation point

04:17.798 --> 04:22.298
for all people found unfit to
live in a new, moral America.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.056
The United States Police
Force, like an army,

04:26.056 --> 04:28.099
is encamped along the shoreline,

04:28.100 --> 04:31.228
making any escape from LA impossible.

04:31.228 --> 04:33.480
From the south-east of Orange County

04:33.481 --> 04:35.733
to the north-western shore of Malibu,

04:35.733 --> 04:39.153
the Great Wall excludes
LA from the mainland.

04:39.153 --> 04:42.072
The President's first
act as commander in chief

04:42.072 --> 04:44.115
is Directive 17.

04:44.116 --> 04:47.577
Once an American loses
his or her citizenship,

04:47.578 --> 04:50.080
they are deported to
this island of the damned

04:50.080 --> 04:51.372
and may never come back.

04:53.417 --> 04:56.586
(dramatic theme music)

05:04.011 --> 05:06.179
(alarm blaring)

05:06.180 --> 05:08.849
- [PA] Attention, we
are on tactical alert.

05:08.849 --> 05:10.934
Remain at battle stations.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.146
I repeat, remain at battle stations.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.784
(helicopter hovering)

05:41.215 --> 05:44.468
(background chattering)

05:50.641 --> 05:51.975
- [Reporter] This is the Police Channel,

05:51.976 --> 05:54.144
and this is Prime News.

05:54.144 --> 05:56.604
In a late-breaking story,
the Force has announced

05:56.605 --> 06:01.105
the arrival of the most
notorious outlaw in US history

06:01.151 --> 06:04.028
at Firebase Seven, the deportation center

06:04.029 --> 06:06.406
for Los Angeles island.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.951
Now this on-the-scene report.

06:08.951 --> 06:12.037
- War hero, criminal, The
Force's most wanted man.

06:12.037 --> 06:14.581
Convicted of 27 moral crimes.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.585
Arrested two weeks ago on a
charge of gunfighting for profit

06:17.585 --> 06:21.130
in New Vegas, Thailand, US territory.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.842
It's been 16 years since his
famous rescue in New York,

06:24.842 --> 06:26.301
and the reports of Plissken sightings

06:26.302 --> 06:28.429
have remained constant during that time.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.930
- [Brazen] Commander?

06:29.930 --> 06:32.015
I'm still getting a trace
from the rescue team, sir.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.560
- Stationary signal?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.270
- Has not moved from this location.

06:38.063 --> 06:41.399
- That means he's hiding,
captured, or dead.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.735
- So we go with Plissken?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.320
- He's all we've got.

06:54.538 --> 06:57.165
(bluesy guitar)

07:11.680 --> 07:13.556
- Hello, Plissken.

07:13.557 --> 07:14.933
Welcome to LA.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.977
- [Officer] Up five link!

07:21.649 --> 07:22.566
- Come on, move it.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.407
- [Brazen] That's Snake Plissken?

07:30.407 --> 07:32.117
- What did you expect?

07:32.117 --> 07:34.077
- I don't know, he just looks so retro.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.121
Kind of 20th century.

07:36.121 --> 07:38.748
- Good old days, let's get going.

07:38.749 --> 07:39.875
- [Reporter] People of the United States

07:39.875 --> 07:41.918
have waited a long time for this criminal.

07:43.253 --> 07:44.128
- [Soldier] Move out!

07:44.129 --> 07:46.798
- [PA] You are now entering
the deportation center.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.218
You have been found guilty
of moral crimes against

07:49.218 --> 07:51.595
the United State of America and sentenced

07:51.595 --> 07:55.015
to permanent expulsion beyond its borders.

07:55.015 --> 07:57.058
Any failure to comply with processing

07:57.059 --> 08:00.479
instructions will be
met with use of force.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.439
- Take a look at them, Plissken.

08:02.439 --> 08:05.483
Prostitutes, atheists, runaways.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.194
We're throwing out the trash.

08:09.321 --> 08:13.658
SD Bob Plissken, Special
Forces, two Purple Hearts.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.994
Youngest man ever
decorated by the President.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.122
Rescued a different President in '97.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.999
So, what happened to you, war hero?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.251
You were the best we had.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.253
Now you're just like one of them.

08:24.253 --> 08:27.547
You had it all, and you
turned away from your country.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.633
Why, huh?

08:29.633 --> 08:31.509
The whole nation's watching.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.803
Every good and decent
person who works hard

08:33.804 --> 08:36.097
and follows the rules.

08:36.097 --> 08:37.933
Be my guest.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.601
What do you have to say, Plissken?

08:40.852 --> 08:41.854
- Call me Snake.

08:47.484 --> 08:50.570
- [PA] You are now entering
the processing area.

08:50.571 --> 08:53.782
The next scheduled departure
to LA is in one hour.

08:56.326 --> 08:58.536
- [Officer] Get over there!

09:02.958 --> 09:05.585
(door slamming)

09:07.171 --> 09:09.548
- [PA] You now have the
option to repent of your sins

09:09.548 --> 09:11.550
and be electrocuted on the premises.

09:11.550 --> 09:12.968
(electricity sparking)

09:12.968 --> 09:16.262
If you elect this option,
notify the cleric sergeant

09:16.263 --> 09:17.430
in your processing area.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.523
(dramatic theme music)

10:04.436 --> 10:06.980
(door opening)

10:09.525 --> 10:11.652
- How's it going, hotshot?

10:14.571 --> 10:15.989
You know, I got to admit,

10:17.074 --> 10:18.742
I thought we had you in Cleveland.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.079
Come on, tell me, how'd you do it?

10:22.079 --> 10:23.747
- Get to the deal.

10:23.747 --> 10:24.581
- What?

10:24.581 --> 10:27.333
- You need me for something, what is it?

10:27.334 --> 10:28.126
- Show him.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.732
- At 1030 hours Wednesday, a
group of government officials

10:50.732 --> 10:53.484
began a tour of the
Benford Space Defense Lab.

10:53.485 --> 10:56.237
The President's daughter
Utopia was among them.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.281
Somehow during the tour,
she came into possession

10:58.282 --> 10:59.908
of a top-secret prototype unit.

11:00.784 --> 11:04.078
One hour later, she boarded
Air Force Three for Lynchburg.

11:04.079 --> 11:06.247
- To the American people.

11:06.248 --> 11:10.085
Now is the time to rise up
and demand the surrender

11:10.085 --> 11:13.463
of the President and his corrupt theocracy

11:13.463 --> 11:16.007
of lies and terror!

11:16.008 --> 11:19.094
- At 1140 hours, she
hijacked Air Force Three.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.931
We scanned this onto the VR.

11:25.517 --> 11:26.351
Check it out.

11:26.351 --> 11:30.851
- Today is day one of a brand-new world.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.109
The days of empire are finished.

11:34.109 --> 11:36.528
To the President, my father.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.449
You know what's in here,
and unless you open

11:40.449 --> 11:44.536
your borders, allow all
the wrongfully accused

11:44.536 --> 11:49.036
to return to their country,
I will use this on you

11:49.041 --> 11:50.542
and on the United States.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.556
- Her emergency escape pod
landed somewhere in LA.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.933
Her ELT signal ceased immediately.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.019
And after that, silence.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.979
- We sent in a five-man rescue team.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.649
Within a few hours of
landing on the island,

12:13.649 --> 12:15.525
all but one of them was killed.

12:15.525 --> 12:16.609
- Hell of a team.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.570
- Skip the commentary, Plissken.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.154
- Snake.

12:20.155 --> 12:21.197
Call me Snake.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.451
- Get on with it.

12:24.451 --> 12:26.244
- Right after her sister
committed suicide,

12:26.245 --> 12:27.996
Utopia began to withdraw from life

12:27.996 --> 12:30.289
into her virtual reality simulator.

12:30.290 --> 12:32.458
She'd punch up her own
little world in cyberspace

12:32.459 --> 12:34.210
and stay in it for days at a time.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.796
- Somebody else was in there with her.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.840
- Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences

12:38.840 --> 12:40.508
and then tried to erase them,

12:40.509 --> 12:42.761
but she missed one five-second image.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.513
We ran a data scan and found this fragment

12:45.514 --> 12:47.516
on the end of her last tape.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.267
- [Malloy] Cuervo Jones.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.853
Peruvian terrorist, Member
of the Shining Path.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.856
Runs the Mescalito Justice,

12:54.856 --> 12:57.608
the biggest, baddest gang in LA

12:57.609 --> 13:00.028
- Somehow, Cuervo Jones managed to tap

13:00.028 --> 13:02.613
into the VR master data bank.

13:02.614 --> 13:05.700
Utopia was lonely, looking
for something to believe in,

13:05.701 --> 13:08.578
and so he used her to steal the black box.

13:08.578 --> 13:11.163
- Sad story, you got a smoke?

13:11.164 --> 13:13.040
- This is serious, Plissken.

13:14.042 --> 13:16.794
The black box is a matter
of national security.

13:16.795 --> 13:20.173
- It looks like it belongs
to Utopia's lover-boy now.

13:20.173 --> 13:22.175
- [Malloy] Yeah, we want it back.

13:23.885 --> 13:24.677
- I'll bet.

13:26.888 --> 13:27.930
What's it do?

13:29.433 --> 13:32.561
- Top secret, only on a need-to-know.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.688
- Evidently, I don't need
to know, so fuck you.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.022
I'm gonna Hollywood.

13:36.023 --> 13:40.318
- If you go into LA,
bring back the black box,

13:40.319 --> 13:42.279
and you will receive a full pardon

13:42.279 --> 13:45.073
for every immoral act
you have ever committed

13:45.073 --> 13:47.116
in the United States.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.034
- Sounds familiar.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.036
- An immediate answer.

13:52.205 --> 13:53.748
Yes or no?

13:57.377 --> 13:58.419
- Who are you?

13:59.504 --> 14:00.505
- I'm your President.

14:01.548 --> 14:04.467
- I understand you got
some domestic problems.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.512
- Put that black box in my
hand, and you're a free man.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.729
- I can see you're real
concerned about your daughter.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.772
- Utopia is lost to me.

14:17.773 --> 14:18.857
My daughter is gone.

14:19.816 --> 14:20.983
- Last chance, hotshot.

14:20.984 --> 14:21.776
- For what?

14:22.694 --> 14:24.278
- Freedom, sir.

14:24.279 --> 14:25.196
- In America?

14:26.823 --> 14:28.825
That died a long time ago.

14:28.825 --> 14:30.034
- All right, I've heard enough of this.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.536
Explain to this foot soldier

14:31.536 --> 14:34.789
why he's gonna do what we tell him to do.

14:37.709 --> 14:39.377
- What's he talking about?

14:39.378 --> 14:41.088
- The Plutoxin Seven virus.

14:42.172 --> 14:46.217
- Genetically engineered, 100% pure death.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.595
Complete nervous system shutdown.

14:48.595 --> 14:49.929
- You crash.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.848
You bleed out like a stuck pig.

14:52.766 --> 14:53.933
It's not a pretty sight.

14:55.852 --> 14:56.644
I see.

14:57.854 --> 14:59.564
You figure you inject that shit into me

14:59.564 --> 15:02.358
and I'll do whatever you
want, just like New York, huh?

15:02.359 --> 15:03.651
- You got it, Snake.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.820
- One question, which one of you assholes

15:05.821 --> 15:07.906
gets to die trying to stick me?

15:07.906 --> 15:08.990
- You don't understand.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.451
It's already in you.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.166
- Catches on quick, doesn't he?

15:22.421 --> 15:24.881
- [Computer] Your countdown
clock is now activated.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.594
- Designer viruses,
Plissken, wave of the future.

15:29.594 --> 15:32.263
Right now you've got less
than 10 hours to live.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.599
- It's already moving
through your bloodstream.

15:34.599 --> 15:36.642
Go ahead, put your hand on that touch pad.

15:41.773 --> 15:44.901
Of course, there is an
antidote, and it neutralizes

15:44.901 --> 15:46.861
the virus immediately upon injection.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.489
- Which I will personally authorize

15:49.489 --> 15:51.073
once your mission is completed.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.248
The man is too dumb to survive LA

15:59.833 --> 16:01.251
- We're holograms, Plissken.

16:02.627 --> 16:05.129
Give us a little credit,
we're not that stupid.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.928
(clock beeping)

16:11.928 --> 16:13.304
- Get this crap out of me.

16:15.599 --> 16:16.933
- I guess we've got a deal.

16:18.643 --> 16:21.270
(clock beeping)

16:24.024 --> 16:25.942
- Nice to be working with you, hotshot.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.864
- You'd better hope I don't make it back.

16:32.365 --> 16:36.410
All of you.

16:36.411 --> 16:40.832
- Core burner, magnesium
ammo, 500 extra rounds.

16:40.832 --> 16:43.251
Oral projectile, mouth dart.

16:43.251 --> 16:44.377
The dart is filled with urolyde.

16:44.377 --> 16:45.878
It will stun the enemy
for several seconds.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.506
- Every member of the rescue
team had a tracking chip

16:48.507 --> 16:50.050
implanted in his arm.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.218
I think one of them might still be alive.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.930
Use the tracer in your
watch to locate him.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.056
- This is a holocam.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.849
It's a portable holographic camera.

16:57.849 --> 16:59.892
It'll project your image
up to a half-mile away.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.228
100% audio send and receive capabilities.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.814
- It's a prototype, confuse
and deceive the enemy.

17:04.814 --> 17:06.607
- Now, it as a mini-nuke
battery good for about

17:06.608 --> 17:08.776
eight minutes, but you
can only use it once.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.904
- So you better save
it for when it counts.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.742
Stick matches, plain,
old-fashioned stick matches.

17:17.743 --> 17:19.328
Never know when you might need them.

17:22.123 --> 17:24.040
- Where are my guns?

17:24.041 --> 17:25.710
- I thought you might want those.

17:33.301 --> 17:37.555
Stealth clothing, fire retardant,
nullifies heat detection.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.348
Put them on.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.023
- I'll take the coat.

17:47.023 --> 17:48.107
- You'll take them all.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.490
(bluesy band music)

18:42.287 --> 18:44.163
- All right, listen up, Plissken.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.957
LA's being primed as a
beachhead for an invasion

18:45.957 --> 18:47.166
of the United States.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.960
- War is about to be declared, Plissken,

18:48.960 --> 18:50.544
or didn't you know?

18:50.545 --> 18:51.420
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.256
You don't give a shit, do you?

18:53.256 --> 18:55.174
- Cuervo Jones runs with Shining Path.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.677
Their goal is to take back North America.

18:57.677 --> 18:59.553
It's the revenge of
preindustrial societies.

18:59.554 --> 19:01.889
- Shining Path has united
all Third-World countries.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.934
The Cubans and Brazilians
are poised to invade Miami.

19:04.934 --> 19:06.769
- If the Ugandans and Colombians
make a run at the border,

19:06.770 --> 19:09.063
we've got a full-scale
attack on the United States.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.190
- High stakes, hotshot.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.608
- [Snake] How am I going in?

19:12.609 --> 19:14.444
- Under the San Fernando Sea.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.988
Shark three submarine,
one-man submersible.

19:16.988 --> 19:17.989
Just like the turbine model,

19:17.989 --> 19:20.157
only this one's nuclear-powered.

19:20.158 --> 19:23.077
It's very simple, throttle
up, keep it in the green,

19:23.078 --> 19:24.329
throttle back.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.955
- You'll put ashore at the Cahuenga Pass.

19:25.955 --> 19:27.164
Make your way up through the mountains

19:27.165 --> 19:28.332
toward the Hollywood Bowl.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.917
Use your tracer to locate the last member

19:29.918 --> 19:30.752
of the rescue team.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.503
If he survived, he's the
only source of information

19:32.504 --> 19:34.422
you'll have on the island.

19:34.422 --> 19:36.257
- Do I bring him back, too?

19:36.257 --> 19:37.424
- No, negative.

19:37.425 --> 19:38.509
- [Snake] Figures.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.929
- For all we know, he's already dead.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.348
In any case, once you go
inside, you're on your own.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.350
When the black box is secure,
get back to the submarine

19:45.350 --> 19:46.351
as fast as you can.

19:47.268 --> 19:49.186
It's your only way out, Plissken?

19:51.064 --> 19:53.149
You know what to do with the girl.

19:53.149 --> 19:55.192
This nation doesn't need to
waste any more time and money

19:55.193 --> 19:57.528
on bullshit trials for high treason.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.738
Kill her.

19:58.738 --> 20:00.614
- Is that an order from the President?

20:00.615 --> 20:03.576
Absolutely, or let's
just say it's what's best

20:03.576 --> 20:04.410
for the country.

20:05.578 --> 20:08.247
- By the way, who gives me the antidote?

20:08.248 --> 20:10.083
- A medical team will be standing by.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.417
- Neither one of you?

20:11.418 --> 20:12.252
- [Malloy] No.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.044
- Good.

20:16.464 --> 20:17.339
(chuckling)

20:17.340 --> 20:19.383
- Thought you might try that, hotshot.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.719
That's why the first clip
is loaded with blanks.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.722
Bye-bye, Snake, good luck.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.352
- [Officer] Nice and easy now.

20:35.191 --> 20:38.402
(dramatic theme music)

20:46.786 --> 20:48.621
- [Malloy] Com check.

20:48.621 --> 20:49.496
- Yeah, I'm here.

20:49.497 --> 20:51.165
- Stand by for launch.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.085
- [Computer] Eight hours,
eight minutes, 26 seconds

20:54.085 --> 20:55.753
to neuro-system shutdown.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.383
- [Malloy] Ignitor.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.763
Fuel rod injection.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.436
- She's in the green.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.687
- [Malloy] Lock fuel rods.

21:13.980 --> 21:15.022
- Locked.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.566
- Nuclear turbine to 75% power.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.533
- 75% power.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.701
- Hands on switches and counting.

21:27.702 --> 21:31.831
Five, four, three, two, one.

21:33.708 --> 21:34.500
Launch.

21:36.878 --> 21:40.339
(suspenseful theme music)

22:08.284 --> 22:09.618
Hey, watch your speed, hotshot.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.579
There's lots of obstructions down there.

22:20.463 --> 22:22.423
- His reactor's starting to overheat.

22:22.423 --> 22:23.340
- Slow it down, Plissken.

22:23.341 --> 22:25.509
You're overloading the power plant.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.677
- You slow down, dickhead.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.096
I'm the one who's dying.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.722
- [Malloy] Plissken!

22:31.516 --> 22:33.184
- [Computer] Power plant overload.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.898
Guidance systems malfunction.

22:40.316 --> 22:42.693
You no longer have control stick function.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.195
Obstruction dead ahead.

22:46.614 --> 22:50.075

23:39.208 --> 23:42.669
(suspenseful theme music)

24:07.070 --> 24:07.862
Plissken.

24:10.156 --> 24:12.366
- Yeah, I'm here, Cahuenga Pass.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.910
- [Malloy] What the hell
happened to the submarine?

24:13.910 --> 24:15.286
Disappeared off our screens.

24:16.287 --> 24:17.079
Plissken!

24:19.791 --> 24:20.666
- I got to go.

24:27.715 --> 24:29.883
- Too bad about your boat, man,

24:29.884 --> 24:33.345
but we'd appreciate it if
you'd stay off our beach.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.847
- Just passing through.

24:38.893 --> 24:41.604

33:47.983 --> 33:51.528
- I'm gonna to give you assholes a chance.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.571
(men laughing)

33:52.571 --> 33:56.408
What do you say we play
a little Bangkok rules?

33:59.954 --> 34:03.165
(soft harmonica music)

34:29.108 --> 34:31.360
Nobody draws until this hits the ground.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.197
You ready?

34:49.878 --> 34:50.670
Draw.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.051
(tires squealing)

35:00.973 --> 35:05.352
(men chattering in foreign language)

35:10.232 --> 35:13.026
- Hey, he left his coat here, man.

35:23.912 --> 35:24.704
- Malloy.

35:27.374 --> 35:28.917
- I'm here, Plissken, have
you got the black box?

35:28.917 --> 35:32.462
- Negative, and I just lost
the core burner and holocam.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.339
- I don't need to know what
your problems are, Plissken.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.799
I just want my black box.

35:35.799 --> 35:38.051
Now, you've got 7 1/2
hours, do you read me?

35:41.055 --> 35:43.140
- Listen to me, Malloy,
this guy's got more heat

35:43.140 --> 35:44.850
around him than the President.

35:44.850 --> 35:46.268
Now, I can get your
precious little box back,

35:46.268 --> 35:48.520
but I'm gonna to need
more time, you understand?

35:48.520 --> 35:50.063
- You listen to me, Plissken.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.191
- That little headache that just kicked in

35:52.191 --> 35:53.734
will only get worse.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.569
You're starting to feel
the effects of the virus.

35:55.569 --> 35:58.113
Soon you'll have a fever
followed by a lack of energy.

35:58.113 --> 36:01.658
Now, you bear that in mind,
just push on through, soldier.

36:03.243 --> 36:05.954
(device beeping)

36:07.122 --> 36:10.083
(soft bluesy theme)

36:32.564 --> 36:34.774
(rumbling)

36:38.529 --> 36:40.239
(sort rattling)

36:40.239 --> 36:43.367
- Oh, don't shoot, don't shoot.

36:44.451 --> 36:45.827
Thought it was you.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.496
Yeah, I recognized you right away.

36:49.581 --> 36:50.498
Oh, I've been hanging out around here

36:50.499 --> 36:51.833
for more years than I want to think about,

36:51.834 --> 36:53.460
but I never thought I'd see Snake Plissken

36:53.460 --> 36:55.003
cruising Sunset Boulevard.

36:55.003 --> 36:56.963
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.298
I'm Map to the Stars Eddie.

37:00.592 --> 37:03.094
- Where's Cuervo Jones' place?

37:03.095 --> 37:04.846
- Oh, he's the man with the juice, Snake.

37:04.847 --> 37:05.848
He's got the President's daughter.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.558
He's setting up something
big, but I got a feeling

37:07.558 --> 37:09.059
you know all about that, right?

37:12.020 --> 37:13.187
- Location.

37:13.188 --> 37:13.980
- That way.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.525
If you're gonna go through Beverly Hills,

37:16.525 --> 37:17.651
you're gonna need a map.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.780
It's prerecorded, I narrated it myself.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.411
Welcome to your very own map to the stars.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.245
That's me.

37:28.245 --> 37:30.372
Sure, we all know the big one wiped out

37:30.372 --> 37:32.499
the entertainment industry here in LA,

37:32.499 --> 37:35.877
but the glamor and excitement
of Hollywood is still alive,

37:35.878 --> 37:38.422
so come with me and see where the stars--

37:38.422 --> 37:40.966
Hey, Snake, you're gonna
need this, I'm telling ya.

37:42.134 --> 37:44.177
All right, I'll give you
a deal, 50,000 bucks.

37:44.178 --> 37:45.012
That's a real bargain.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.723
Map to the Stars Eddie, and here we go.

37:47.723 --> 37:48.515
Sucker.

37:53.020 --> 37:56.773
(distant gun firing)

37:56.774 --> 37:59.485
(sirens wailing)

38:15.793 --> 38:19.505
(men shouting and clamoring)

38:21.048 --> 38:23.925
- Ssh, stay down, man, or they'll see you.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.218
This is only their second shift.

38:25.219 --> 38:27.054
You make one move, and we're done.

38:28.972 --> 38:30.598
And don't make noise.

38:30.599 --> 38:33.393
If you want to make noise,
go and find another bush.

38:33.393 --> 38:35.228
- You're the one making all the noise.

38:42.986 --> 38:46.197
(haunting theme music)

38:50.911 --> 38:51.703
Ah, shit!

38:55.791 --> 38:58.335
(man grunting)

39:00.712 --> 39:02.755
- Plissken's tracer just went down.

39:02.756 --> 39:03.590
- Terminated?

39:03.590 --> 39:05.008
- Yes, sir, we can't even locate him

39:05.008 --> 39:06.467
on heat seek, he's wearing stealth.

39:06.468 --> 39:07.552
- Now what?

39:07.553 --> 39:08.720
- We sit tight, and we wait for the man

39:08.720 --> 39:09.804
to communicate with us.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.849
- Wait, for how long, he's probably dead.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.726
- Wait, Mr. President.

39:14.726 --> 39:15.518
Be patient.

39:17.312 --> 39:20.273
(people chattering)

39:22.025 --> 39:24.986
(distant screaming)

39:29.366 --> 39:32.327
(distant screaming)

39:44.464 --> 39:47.008
- I told you to stay down,
now look what you've done.

39:47.009 --> 39:49.261
Oh, I can't believe this.

39:51.638 --> 39:53.514
Are you Snake Plissken?

39:55.309 --> 39:57.686
You look like him, in a way.

39:59.187 --> 40:02.773
By the way, genius, we're both dead meat.

40:08.989 --> 40:12.367
(distant screaming)

40:12.367 --> 40:13.242
- What are they?

40:14.453 --> 40:16.788
- Surgical failures.

40:16.788 --> 40:18.414
They live here.

40:18.415 --> 40:21.459
Too many implants and
face-lifts over the years.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.920
Their muscles turn to Jell-O.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.215
The only way they survive
is to have fresh body parts

40:27.215 --> 40:30.134
transplanted over and over again.

40:35.390 --> 40:37.892
Oh, my God.

40:37.893 --> 40:41.104
- [Snake] Who's that?

40:41.104 --> 40:44.315
- The surgeon general of Beverly Hills.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.235
- These are no good.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.239
You couldn't give them away.

40:52.199 --> 40:52.991
And this,

40:55.077 --> 40:56.578
I can do nothing with this one.

40:57.579 --> 40:59.038
Yeah, wheel it away.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.749
- [Worker] You heard what
the man said, get rid of it.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.751
- I can't work with garbage like this.

41:06.088 --> 41:06.963
Now, these two.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.552
They look very good.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.434
My God, they're real.

41:25.941 --> 41:28.568
(ominous music)

41:36.702 --> 41:39.121
What a beautiful blue eye.

41:39.121 --> 41:41.123
Shame he only has one.

41:41.123 --> 41:41.915
Nurse.

41:43.333 --> 41:44.125
Still,

41:46.837 --> 41:49.047
one eye's better than none.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.269
Anybody moves, I blow his
brains out and then yours.

42:05.939 --> 42:07.899
You, get my guns.

42:08.900 --> 42:09.692
Now.

42:15.866 --> 42:16.741
Back off.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.453
Now, everybody relax, and he won't die.

42:20.454 --> 42:23.248
- Hey, hey, man, help me.

42:23.248 --> 42:25.917
You're never gonna find your
way out of here without me.

42:27.836 --> 42:28.628
Really.

42:29.796 --> 42:30.588
- Cut her down.

42:40.140 --> 42:43.893
- [Worker] Hey, get moving!

42:43.894 --> 42:48.394
- Down there.

42:50.025 --> 42:50.817
Quickly.

42:51.693 --> 42:54.737
(men clamoring)

42:54.738 --> 42:56.114
- [Snake] Get in.

43:03.997 --> 43:06.791
(crowd clamoring)

43:19.429 --> 43:20.513
- I think we lost them.

43:21.431 --> 43:23.641
(clock beeping)

43:23.642 --> 43:25.226
- I think we're lost.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.102
(clicking tongue)

43:26.103 --> 43:26.895
- This way.

43:28.772 --> 43:33.026
I used to run guns with
the Black Jihad last year.

43:33.026 --> 43:36.279
We drove golf carts up
and down these tunnels.

43:36.279 --> 43:38.155
I know them like the back of my hand.

43:42.619 --> 43:44.621
You are Snake Plissken, aren't you?

43:44.621 --> 43:45.413
- I used to be.

43:46.331 --> 43:47.665
- I thought you'd be taller.

43:50.168 --> 43:51.127
So, what are you doing in LA?

43:51.128 --> 43:52.295
- I'm dying.

43:52.295 --> 43:53.629
- Ooh.

43:53.630 --> 43:55.423
But first you got to find something?

43:57.008 --> 43:59.677
- President's daughter,
she's with Cuervo Jones.

43:59.678 --> 44:02.305
- So you want to go to Cuervo's place?

44:02.305 --> 44:03.889
I've been there once.

44:03.890 --> 44:04.682
- Show me.

44:06.393 --> 44:07.185
- All right.

44:08.770 --> 44:11.147
I used to hear about you all the time,

44:11.148 --> 44:14.276
like they could never catch
you no matter what you did.

44:14.276 --> 44:16.236
Very cool, Snake.

44:16.236 --> 44:18.905
- Sooner or later, they get everybody.

44:18.905 --> 44:19.697
- Up.

44:30.667 --> 44:33.795
(distant guns firing)

44:38.008 --> 44:39.551
Cuervo Jones' place is down that way.

44:39.551 --> 44:41.261
(Snake coughing)

44:41.261 --> 44:44.639
Get off at the Vermont exit, go south.

44:44.639 --> 44:45.556
You can't miss it.

44:46.474 --> 44:49.643
Be careful, though, this
is Korean Dragon territory.

44:49.644 --> 44:51.187
It's very dangerous around here.

44:52.939 --> 44:53.731
Bye.

44:56.651 --> 44:57.443
Snake?

45:01.656 --> 45:03.991
When you find the President's daughter,

45:03.992 --> 45:05.410
are you gonna take her back?

45:05.410 --> 45:06.202
- No.

45:07.704 --> 45:08.746
- [Taslima] So you are staying in LA?

45:08.747 --> 45:10.415
- Not if I can help it.

45:13.084 --> 45:14.794
- Sun is coming up in a few hours.

45:16.504 --> 45:18.380
UVs' gonna be bad today.

45:19.799 --> 45:23.385
I know a place where we
could crash if you want.

45:25.263 --> 45:28.140
My boyfriend and I broke up tonight, so,

45:30.101 --> 45:31.477
I'd love to take care of you

45:34.522 --> 45:35.814
and make you feel good.

45:38.276 --> 45:40.069
I'll read your future.

45:42.656 --> 45:44.783
- The future is right now.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.340
(eerie music)

46:09.849 --> 46:11.934
(distant chattering)

46:11.935 --> 46:14.604
- And condemn the innocent blood.

46:14.604 --> 46:17.148
Dear God, we call on
You to be our defense,

46:17.148 --> 46:20.276
our rock, and our refuge, let us pray.

46:20.277 --> 46:24.322
We give thanks for being
alive and pray that

46:24.322 --> 46:25.156
in Your mercy--

46:26.574 --> 46:28.826
- Snake, it's me, Taslima.

46:32.038 --> 46:34.206
I'm coming with you to
Cuervo's place, yeah?

46:38.378 --> 46:39.796
They're new.

46:39.796 --> 46:42.089
They don't belong to any gang.

46:42.090 --> 46:44.342
They're just scared, that's all.

46:44.342 --> 46:47.219
That's how I was when
they first deported me.

46:47.220 --> 46:48.846
- Why are you here?

46:48.847 --> 46:51.266
- I was a Muslim in South Dakota.

46:51.266 --> 46:53.559
All of a sudden, they made it a crime.

46:53.560 --> 46:56.145
- I mean, why do you stay,
you can go south, Mexico.

46:57.647 --> 46:59.148
- LA is still the place, Snake.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.191
If you think about what's happened

47:00.191 --> 47:03.777
on the other side of the
world, that's the prison.

47:03.778 --> 47:07.198
This is the only free zone left, anywhere.

47:10.618 --> 47:11.493
- Dark paradise.

47:13.371 --> 47:16.082
- At least we get
something out of the deal.

47:16.082 --> 47:19.585
A girl can still wear a fur coat

47:19.586 --> 47:21.713
if she wants to, for example.

47:22.714 --> 47:24.841
No, no, no, once you
figure out this place,

47:24.841 --> 47:27.426
it's really not so bad.

47:27.427 --> 47:28.469
(gun firing)

47:28.470 --> 47:29.721
(man shouting in foreign language)

47:29.721 --> 47:30.596
- Get down!

47:33.683 --> 47:36.977
(automatic guns firing)

47:40.065 --> 47:42.609
(guns firing)

47:46.821 --> 47:49.406
- [Bystander] Where's it coming from?

47:49.407 --> 47:52.034
- [Second Bystander] The
car in the street below!

47:52.035 --> 47:54.162
(beeping)

47:56.831 --> 48:00.084
(automatic gun firing)

48:08.843 --> 48:13.343
(gunman shouting in foreign language)

48:30.490 --> 48:32.617
- Hop in, Snake, come on.

48:37.872 --> 48:38.956
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

48:38.957 --> 48:39.958
How did you get out of Beverly Hills?

48:39.958 --> 48:41.084
Nobody ever gets out of there alive.

48:41.084 --> 48:43.127
- Yeah, maybe that's why
you let me walk in there.

48:43.128 --> 48:45.004
- Oh, come on, man, I tried to tell you,

48:45.004 --> 48:47.423
you need one of my maps to get around.

48:47.424 --> 48:48.716
- [Bystander] Shut up down there!

48:48.716 --> 48:49.550
(woman shouting in foreign language)

48:49.551 --> 48:50.385
- You got to start listening to me, Snake.

48:50.385 --> 48:51.677
I got connections around here.

48:51.678 --> 48:53.638
If you need anything, I'm the man to see.

48:53.638 --> 48:55.056
You can't just be walking around town

48:55.056 --> 48:55.973
without knowing the ropes.

48:55.974 --> 48:57.308
You take the wrong
street, you're dead, pal.

48:57.308 --> 48:58.392
- Stop the car.

49:00.562 --> 49:02.939
- All right, Snake, anything you say.

49:02.939 --> 49:05.858
Although I was gonna take
you to Cuervo Jones' place.

49:05.859 --> 49:06.651
- Where is it?

49:07.777 --> 49:08.903
- It's right over there.

49:10.864 --> 49:14.117
(distant gun firing)

49:14.117 --> 49:16.828
(Snake grunting)

49:17.787 --> 49:19.163
It's pretty neat, huh?

49:19.164 --> 49:22.167
This is Cuervo's car, he
lets me use it sometimes.

49:22.167 --> 49:23.001
Hey, not to worry, Snake.

49:23.001 --> 49:24.961
You've just been shot with a fun gun.

49:24.961 --> 49:26.796
Feel it, you feel it?

49:26.796 --> 49:29.298
It's pure mesh, man,
100 proof artery choker.

49:30.425 --> 49:32.176
It's like Cuervo says,
when the hit pulls you down

49:32.177 --> 49:35.597
to one inch from death,
that is living, man.

49:35.597 --> 49:36.431
You should have talked to me first.

49:36.431 --> 49:38.224
I could have set this up,
I'm actually Cuervo's agent,

49:38.224 --> 49:40.100
and I would love to represent you.

49:40.101 --> 49:42.144
We could make a bundle together,
I could help your career.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.813
You're a legend and all,
but last couple of years,

49:43.813 --> 49:46.273
it's like you've fallen
off the face of the earth.

49:47.775 --> 49:49.234
Cuervo, I delivered him, didn't I?

49:49.235 --> 49:51.237
I figured out what the
cops sent him in to do.

49:51.237 --> 49:52.613
Plissken was the second rescue team.

49:52.614 --> 49:54.407
He was supposed to get
the black box and the girl

49:54.407 --> 49:56.617
and take them back out over the wall.

49:56.618 --> 49:59.329
All I'm asking for is a finder's
fee after you take over.

49:59.329 --> 50:01.331
Maybe Wisconsin, I don't know.

50:01.331 --> 50:02.957
- OK, We're almost set up, Cuervo.

50:02.957 --> 50:04.249
- [Cuervo] Good.

50:06.628 --> 50:08.254
- Well, I originally heard about this

50:08.254 --> 50:09.588
when I was working for NASA.

50:10.673 --> 50:11.465
Check this out.

50:13.009 --> 50:15.720
Common, ordinary
remote-control unit, yeah?

50:15.720 --> 50:17.805
Everyone's got one, right?

50:17.805 --> 50:18.680
Here's the kicker.

50:20.266 --> 50:22.393
This instruction disk hooks you

50:22.393 --> 50:24.728
right into the sword of Damocles,

50:24.729 --> 50:26.772
the ultimate defensive weapon system.

50:31.402 --> 50:32.611
You see that?

50:32.612 --> 50:35.281
There's a ring of satellites
encircling the Earth.

50:35.281 --> 50:39.781
Attached to each satellite
is a mega neutron bomb.

50:39.869 --> 50:43.038
When detonated, each
satellite unleashes an intense

50:43.039 --> 50:44.707
electromagnetic pulse,

50:45.750 --> 50:47.752
but EMP doesn't harm a living thing.

50:47.752 --> 50:52.089
What it does do is shut down
every known power source,

50:52.090 --> 50:55.384
all electrical devices,
cars, airplanes, toasters,

50:55.385 --> 50:58.262
computers, everything, even batteries.

50:58.263 --> 50:59.305
But this

51:00.974 --> 51:04.018
makes this an aiming device

51:04.018 --> 51:06.687
that gives the user incredible accuracy.

51:08.231 --> 51:10.858
You can pinpoint precisely
what you want to shut down.

51:11.776 --> 51:15.029
A taxi cab in Buenos Aires,
the entire country of Spain.

51:15.029 --> 51:16.655
Amazing, brilliant.

51:16.656 --> 51:19.075
Hell, you could key in all
the satellites and shut down

51:19.075 --> 51:22.286
the whole planet, send it
right back to the Dark Ages.

51:22.287 --> 51:23.454
- Let's face it, he's dead.

51:23.454 --> 51:24.663
- I agree.

51:24.664 --> 51:25.915
- Plissken's been dead so many times

51:25.915 --> 51:29.168
I can't count them all,
but he never stays down.

51:29.168 --> 51:30.919
- The mission's scrubbed, Commander.

51:31.921 --> 51:35.049
I should never have let you
talk me out of that air strike.

51:35.049 --> 51:36.508
Well, it's on now.

51:36.509 --> 51:39.845
Effective immediately, full-scale.

51:39.846 --> 51:41.556
Target, Los Angeles.

51:41.556 --> 51:43.099
Flatten it, burn it.

51:43.099 --> 51:43.849
- No!

51:47.729 --> 51:48.938
- What did you say to me?

51:50.148 --> 51:53.276
- Cuervo Jones is holding
all the cards now, sir.

51:53.276 --> 51:56.904
He sees our aircraft come in,
he pushes that button, kaboom!

51:56.904 --> 51:58.155
There goes our aircraft, and there goes

51:58.156 --> 51:59.615
the United States of America.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.203
- We don't even know
if he knows how to work

52:04.203 --> 52:05.746
the goddamn thing.

52:05.747 --> 52:09.000
- Snake Plissken, American outlaw.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.459
You're going to like this.

52:12.545 --> 52:14.046
- Remember, Cuervo, you got to punch in

52:14.047 --> 52:16.758
the world code first, 666.

52:16.758 --> 52:18.301
That brings all the satellites online.

52:18.301 --> 52:20.094
Then you can aim the prototype.

52:20.094 --> 52:22.513
- Eh, pendejo, you think I'm stupid?

52:22.513 --> 52:25.474
- No, no, no, I'm sorry, Cuervo.

52:25.475 --> 52:26.392
- [Cuervo] Bring them in.

52:26.392 --> 52:30.687
(henchman speaking in foreign language)

52:30.688 --> 52:31.980
- OK, OK, go on.

52:34.942 --> 52:36.193
- Hello, North America.

52:37.153 --> 52:39.822
Buenas noches, Sud America.

52:39.822 --> 52:40.614
Yes,

52:42.158 --> 52:44.160
I am Cuervo Jones.

52:44.160 --> 52:44.952
- Wait a minute.

52:45.953 --> 52:47.871
That's Plissken.
- This is the real LA

52:48.956 --> 52:51.291
People without hope, without a country.

52:51.292 --> 52:52.293
- I knew it, he's alive.

52:52.293 --> 52:54.128
- You know what they want?

52:55.088 --> 52:55.880
Liberation.

52:57.090 --> 52:58.216
Now it's their turn.

52:59.884 --> 53:01.844
I'm taking over with this.

53:03.846 --> 53:07.766
Now, I told you not to try
to get this back, didn't I?

53:07.767 --> 53:08.934
But you disobeyed me.

53:10.103 --> 53:11.479
Well...

53:11.479 --> 53:12.605
(monitor beeping)

53:12.605 --> 53:14.148
- He's entering the target code.

53:15.900 --> 53:17.192
- Bend over, Mr. President.

53:18.444 --> 53:19.736
Time for a spanking.

53:21.072 --> 53:23.407
- He's targeting Lynchburg,
that'll shut down the capital.

53:23.408 --> 53:25.159
- Patch me in to the White House.

53:25.159 --> 53:26.410
- This broadcast is going out
live all across the country.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.287
- Yes, this is the President.

53:28.287 --> 53:30.289
Get me my wife, please.

53:30.289 --> 53:31.248
- [Eve] Are you watching TV?

53:31.249 --> 53:33.459
- Yes, Eve, I'm watching it too.

53:34.419 --> 53:36.045
Yes, I know.

53:36.045 --> 53:37.379
- Curfew.

53:37.380 --> 53:39.215
- Hello, hello?

53:40.800 --> 53:44.053
- Hey, Presidente, silence is golden, no?

53:45.555 --> 53:49.308
Don't tell me you didn't
enjoy this just a little bit.

53:49.308 --> 53:52.227
I mean, if your wife's
anything like your daughter,

53:52.228 --> 53:55.856
she's sweet to eat, but
you just can't shut her up.

53:55.857 --> 53:58.150
- [Utopia] Hey, knock it off, Cuervo.

53:58.151 --> 54:00.611
- All right, now this is set.

54:00.611 --> 54:03.447
We shut down the entire United States.

54:03.448 --> 54:07.410
I want a police chopper to come and get me

54:07.410 --> 54:11.372
at the Happy Kingdom
no later than 5:00 AM.

54:11.372 --> 54:14.833
Once I'm airborne, you'll get your orders.

54:14.834 --> 54:18.796
Remember, don't piss me
off, or I'll pull the plug.

54:23.092 --> 54:25.385
- I'm at the mercy of this madman.

54:25.386 --> 54:27.262
- Don't count Plissken out, sir.

54:27.263 --> 54:29.139
- He's tanked, he's a POW.

54:30.725 --> 54:31.851
- But he's still alive.

54:33.144 --> 54:36.438
(dramatic theme music)

54:48.367 --> 54:51.661
(crowd shouting)

54:51.662 --> 54:56.041
(crowd shouting in foreign language)

55:01.297 --> 55:04.508
(dramatic theme music)

55:20.650 --> 55:22.860
(grunting)

55:30.034 --> 55:33.662
(crowd clamoring)

55:33.663 --> 55:36.457
(blades clashing)

55:47.093 --> 55:50.221
- [Crowd] 10, nine, eight, seven, six,

55:51.222 --> 55:53.474
five, four, three, two, one.

55:56.602 --> 55:59.396
(buzzer sounding)

56:00.857 --> 56:02.984
- [Announcer] Shot clock!

56:02.984 --> 56:06.362
(automatic guns firing)

56:09.615 --> 56:12.659
(audience cheering)

56:22.336 --> 56:24.129
- Get him, get him up.

56:27.884 --> 56:30.845
(audience cheering)

56:32.388 --> 56:34.765
- But this is insane.

56:34.765 --> 56:36.433
- It is.

56:36.434 --> 56:37.810
That's the point.

56:40.563 --> 56:43.357
(woman screaming)

56:48.446 --> 56:49.321
- Aah, yah!

56:51.407 --> 56:52.491
Yah!

56:52.491 --> 56:55.452
(audience jeering)

56:58.664 --> 57:00.540
- All right, all right.

57:05.379 --> 57:06.922
Hey!

57:06.923 --> 57:09.759
(feedback sounding)

57:09.759 --> 57:11.969
I promised you tonight
was gonna be special.

57:12.929 --> 57:16.557
I also promised you one last
great spectacle of death here

57:16.557 --> 57:18.016
in this historic arena.

57:18.935 --> 57:20.978
Now you will see that death.

57:22.146 --> 57:23.105
I give you

57:24.190 --> 57:28.690
the death of Snake Plissken!

57:28.736 --> 57:31.780
(audience cheering)

57:39.538 --> 57:43.667
(audience cheering and clamoring)

57:46.295 --> 57:49.548
Some people think you're
already dead, Snake.

57:49.548 --> 57:51.800
Some say you never will be.

57:51.801 --> 57:54.720
'Cause you may have survived Cleveland,

57:54.720 --> 57:57.222
you may have escaped from New York,

57:57.223 --> 57:59.892
but this is LA, vato.

57:59.892 --> 58:03.812
And you're about to find
out that this fucking city

58:03.813 --> 58:05.940
can kill anybody!

58:05.940 --> 58:08.901
- [Audience] LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA,

58:11.028 --> 58:13.572
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA,

58:19.036 --> 58:20.328
LA, LA, LA, LA,

58:24.291 --> 58:25.250
- Game time!

58:32.091 --> 58:32.925
Basketball.

58:34.010 --> 58:35.928
Two hoops, full court.

58:35.928 --> 58:37.429
- 10 second shot clock.

58:37.430 --> 58:39.390
Miss a shot, you get shot.

58:39.390 --> 58:42.601
Shot clock buzzer goes off
before you shoot, you get shot.

58:42.601 --> 58:45.312
Two points for a basket,
no three-point bullshit.

58:46.355 --> 58:48.940
All you got to do is
make points, that's it.

58:53.195 --> 58:56.823
By the way, nobody's ever
walked off that court alive.

58:58.617 --> 58:59.409
Nobody.

59:00.453 --> 59:02.413
(audience cheering)

59:02.413 --> 59:04.540
(beeping)

59:06.917 --> 59:07.709
All right!

59:09.462 --> 59:11.922
(buzzer sounding)

59:11.922 --> 59:15.216
- [Crowd] Eight, seven, six, five, four,

59:16.927 --> 59:18.219
three, two, one!

59:19.930 --> 59:21.014
(crowd jeering)

59:21.015 --> 59:23.308
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

59:25.269 --> 59:26.144
five, four,

59:27.271 --> 59:28.563
three, two, one!

59:31.150 --> 59:34.403
(buzzer sounding)

59:34.403 --> 59:37.697
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

59:40.576 --> 59:41.868
three, two, one!

59:44.413 --> 59:45.956
(buzzer sounding)

59:45.956 --> 59:48.583
(crowd jeering)

59:50.336 --> 59:52.296
Ten, nine, eight, seven--

59:53.672 --> 59:54.673
- Nice shot.

59:54.673 --> 59:55.924
- He's getting tired now.

59:55.925 --> 59:58.552
- [Crowd] Four, three, two, one.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.472
(buzzer sounding)

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:09.396
(dramatic theme music)

01:00:13.984 --> 01:00:16.695
(Snake panting)

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.586
(Snake grunting)

01:00:39.593 --> 01:00:42.721
(audience chattering)

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:56.110
- [Audience] Snake, Snake,
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake,

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:59.488
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake,

01:01:00.614 --> 01:01:03.491
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake!

01:01:03.492 --> 01:01:04.493
- This town loves a winner.

01:01:04.493 --> 01:01:07.621
- [Audience] Snake, Snake,
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake,

01:01:07.621 --> 01:01:10.874
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake,

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.669
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake,

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:15.879
Snake, Snake, Snake!

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.798
- He won, Cuervo.

01:01:17.798 --> 01:01:18.590
(cocking gun)

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:20.759
- [Audience] Snake, Snake,
Snake, Snake, Snake!

01:01:20.759 --> 01:01:21.801
- You can't kill him.

01:01:23.053 --> 01:01:24.471
- I have to.

01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:27.056
- Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake!

01:01:27.057 --> 01:01:28.266
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake!

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:30.727
(gun firing)

01:01:31.812 --> 01:01:33.355
- Get off!

01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:36.316
- Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake!

01:01:38.986 --> 01:01:40.153
- [Henchmen] Free shot!

01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:41.697
- It's the big one!

01:01:50.414 --> 01:01:52.791
(gun firing)

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:55.335
- Find him!

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:57.254
We're gonna Anaheim.

01:01:57.254 --> 01:01:58.046
Come here.

01:02:00.299 --> 01:02:03.427
- [Eddie] Cuervo, Cuervo, wait up.

01:02:03.427 --> 01:02:04.678
Give me a minute.

01:02:04.678 --> 01:02:05.970
- Get lost, agent!

01:02:05.971 --> 01:02:07.889
- Come on, we got a
relationship here, man.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.975
- Let me make something clear to you.

01:02:09.975 --> 01:02:13.103
I'm starting to get irritated,
and that's not a good thing.

01:02:13.103 --> 01:02:14.854
- [Eddie] Irritated with me,
Cuervo, I'm taking care of you.

01:02:14.855 --> 01:02:16.982
I'm with you in all this,
don't you understand?

01:02:16.982 --> 01:02:18.441
- We can't find him, Cuervo.

01:02:18.442 --> 01:02:19.901
- So keep looking!

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:23.363
(suspenseful theme music)

01:02:28.786 --> 01:02:29.995
(men shouting)

01:02:29.995 --> 01:02:31.204
Get in the car.

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:37.293
If I'm being too rough on
you, you just let me know, OK?

01:02:37.294 --> 01:02:40.005
(loud exploding)

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.801
(suspenseful theme music)

01:03:22.214 --> 01:03:26.009
- Snake, wait, don't
shoot, it's me, Utopia.

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.971
I'm alone.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:32.724
This whole place is a nightmare.

01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:34.143
Cuervo's a killer.

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:36.270
He's worse than my father.

01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:39.939
I want to go back with you.

01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:45.320
(cocking gun)

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.322
Oh, my God.

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:50.492
My father sent you to kill me, didn't he?

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:55.455
(sobbing)

01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:56.248
- Shit.

01:03:58.459 --> 01:03:59.877
Get out of here.

01:03:59.877 --> 01:04:01.837
(Snake coughing)

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:03.213
Go.

01:04:03.213 --> 01:04:05.965
- Wait, you can't take that back, Snake.

01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:09.219
Oh, God, you can't give that to him.

01:04:09.219 --> 01:04:13.056
All he wants to do is control
everything, just like Cuervo.

01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:17.269
- If I don't take it back, I'm dead.

01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:20.480
(rumbling)

01:04:22.107 --> 01:04:24.484
- Oh, not another one!

01:04:24.485 --> 01:04:25.319
(gun firing)

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:28.030
(Snake grunting)

01:04:38.332 --> 01:04:39.124
- Run!

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:50.177
(glass shattering)

01:04:51.303 --> 01:04:52.095
- It's over.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.598
Get me a complete damage
report as soon as possible.

01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:56.391
- Yes, sir.

01:04:57.601 --> 01:04:58.810
- Oh, thank God Almighty.

01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:04.358
Maybe that's the answer
to all of our problems.

01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:05.150
Maybe,

01:05:06.944 --> 01:05:08.236
maybe they're all dead.

01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:10.906
- Maybe.

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:13.199
(background shouting)

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.659
- Oh, Cuervo, man!

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.370
We almost bought the farm.

01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:19.581
The whole place just
fell in right behind us.

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:22.584
- Where is Plissken?

01:05:22.584 --> 01:05:25.128
- He's down there, he's dead.

01:05:25.129 --> 01:05:29.629
He's history, and I did it,
I killed him, I shot him.

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:30.467
Right, tell him.

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:36.848
- Give it to me.

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:37.641
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:40.894
I brought it back to you, Cuervo.

01:05:40.894 --> 01:05:41.811
It's all there.

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:46.233
(upbeat rock music)

01:05:49.778 --> 01:05:51.654
♪ Whoa ♪

01:05:55.617 --> 01:05:58.494
- Whoa, dude, is that you, Snake?

01:05:59.872 --> 01:06:00.706
Far out, man.

01:06:02.207 --> 01:06:03.917
Hey, did you find Cuervo, man?

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:06.461
- Hey, Cuervo, wait,
I've done it all, man.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.380
I killed Plissken, I got your girl back.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.006
I gave you all the marbles,
just for you, Cuervo.

01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:11.508
- So where is he?

01:06:12.509 --> 01:06:13.301
- I shot him.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.971
He went down, OK?

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.931
I mean, his body's probably washed down

01:06:17.931 --> 01:06:19.933
into Wilshire Canyon somewhere.

01:06:19.933 --> 01:06:22.101
- Good, so then you know where he is.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.395
Bring me his head.

01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:30.735
- Where's the Happy Kingdom?

01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:31.737
- Anaheim.

01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:33.655
It's the staging area
for the big invasion.

01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:35.740
The whole town's gonna
be there, except me.

01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:38.493
I'm staying right here, man,
I'm ready for the big wave.

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.245
It's gonna be some eternal one.

01:06:40.245 --> 01:06:41.162
- [Snake] Take me there.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:41.997
- What?

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:42.831
- [Snake] Take me there!

01:06:42.831 --> 01:06:44.207
- Hey, you're not doing so well, Snake.

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:45.542
You need help, here.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.629
Hold on.

01:06:48.629 --> 01:06:49.463
(Snake groaning)

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:50.589
- Who shot you?

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:51.631
- It doesn't matter.

01:06:51.632 --> 01:06:53.091
- Well, yeah, you're right.

01:06:53.091 --> 01:06:55.343
You know, you should talk to Hershe,

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:57.846
she hates Cuervo, big-time.

01:06:57.846 --> 01:06:59.264
They used to be partners,
and they split up.

01:06:59.264 --> 01:07:00.306
- Who?

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:01.141
- Hershe.

01:07:01.141 --> 01:07:03.810
She lives downtown in a
big boat, down that way.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:05.812
She hangs with Saigon Shadow.

01:07:05.812 --> 01:07:08.147
Man, they don't take shit from nobody.

01:07:08.148 --> 01:07:08.982
(waves crashing)

01:07:08.982 --> 01:07:10.149
- [Snake] What is that?

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:12.485
- Tsunami, Snake, Tsunami, whoo!

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:16.448
Surf's up big-time now, mister, ha ha!

01:07:17.824 --> 01:07:18.991
Start feeling better quick, man,

01:07:18.992 --> 01:07:21.119
'cause you ain't got
time to get out of here.

01:07:21.995 --> 01:07:23.788
This is gonna be some kind of ride, man.

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:26.082
Some kind of bitchin'
ride, let's go, come on.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:27.250
Whoo, bitchin'.

01:07:29.002 --> 01:07:29.836
Bitchin', man.

01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:32.672
OK.

01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:34.800
Let the front edge pick you up.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.344
Don't get on your board
till you ride to the top.

01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:39.429
Don't blow it, if you fall off the board,

01:07:39.429 --> 01:07:41.222
it's the big one, got it?

01:07:42.474 --> 01:07:43.266
Whoo!

01:07:44.184 --> 01:07:44.976
Bitchin'.

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:48.188
Hang on, Snake, whoo!

01:07:48.188 --> 01:07:51.149
(upbeat rock music)

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:15.507
- You got to be kidding me.

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:21.011
- Later.

01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:22.471
- Ooh, Snake, aha!

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:28.645
(upbeat rock music)

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:52.544
(bystanders shouting)

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:01.176
(horn honking repeatedly)

01:09:03.095 --> 01:09:05.848
(tires squealing)

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:19.946
- You're gonna tell me
how to get downtown,

01:09:19.946 --> 01:09:21.447
somebody named Hershe.

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:23.408
- Yeah, sure, Snake, no problem.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:24.200
- Hey, hey!

01:09:25.702 --> 01:09:26.868
- Are you gonna kill me?

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:27.703
- Hershe.

01:09:27.703 --> 01:09:30.747
- Right, keep going straight,
two blocks down, make a right.

01:09:33.085 --> 01:09:35.879
(tires squealing)

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:44.763
- [Computer] Warning,
neuro-system shutdown, one hour.

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:50.977
(dramatic theme music)

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.953
- I first met Hershe when I got deported.

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:09.496
She helped set me up in business.

01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:11.623
We're talking a power player, Snake.

01:10:11.623 --> 01:10:13.166
Cuervo's got the numbers
and the firepower,

01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:15.918
but Hershe's got a burning
spine made out of steel.

01:10:15.919 --> 01:10:17.462
Big-time fast-lane ambitions.

01:10:17.462 --> 01:10:19.255
Think about it, the two
of you hooked up together,

01:10:19.256 --> 01:10:21.049
I'm talking box-office material here.

01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:22.926
What?

01:10:26.012 --> 01:10:28.556
Easy, Snake, I see him, too.

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:29.808
We're OK, come on.

01:10:31.017 --> 01:10:31.976
Yeah, she's gonna love you, Snake.

01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:32.811
You're gonna love her, too.

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:34.312
We're gonna make this thing happen.

01:10:35.772 --> 01:10:36.856
By the way, I'm through with Cuervo.

01:10:36.857 --> 01:10:39.067
The guy's got no sense
of loyalty whatsoever.

01:10:40.986 --> 01:10:42.737
Right through here.

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:43.739
- [Man At Door] What?

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.824
- Hey, man, how you
doing, long time, no see.

01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:47.826
Remember me, Map to the Stars Eddie.

01:10:49.035 --> 01:10:50.911
Yeah, well, I got somebody
I want Hershe to meet.

01:10:50.912 --> 01:10:53.164
Snake Plissken, baby,
right here in the flesh.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.586
- [Man At Door] Your gun.

01:10:58.754 --> 01:10:59.796
- Great, thanks, pal.

01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:05.927
All right, we're in,
strange scene in here.

01:11:05.927 --> 01:11:07.094
Let me do the talking.

01:11:09.931 --> 01:11:12.642
(Snake coughing)

01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:17.856
Hey, Hershe, how you doin'?

01:11:19.316 --> 01:11:22.068
Hang on, hang on, guys, this
is big, it's Snake Plissken.

01:11:22.068 --> 01:11:23.319
I brought him here to see you, Hershe.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.697
He's got a little business proposition.

01:11:25.697 --> 01:11:27.365
- What's in it for me?

01:11:27.365 --> 01:11:29.325
- Well--
- Wait a minute.

01:11:32.704 --> 01:11:34.163
I know that voice.

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:38.710
Yeah, you're Carjack Malone.

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.338
- Not anymore.

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:43.840
- [Eddie] You two know each other?

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:53.474
- Well, the more things
change, the more they stay

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.560
the same, huh, Carjack?

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.604
Glad to see you're still
packing a gun between your legs.

01:11:58.605 --> 01:11:59.522
- Hold on, honey.

01:11:59.523 --> 01:12:01.191
- You owe me.

01:12:01.191 --> 01:12:02.692
You bolted on me back in Cleveland.

01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:04.068
- Hershe, you were in Cleveland?

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:06.738
- Oh, yeah, with me and Texas Mike O'Shay,

01:12:06.738 --> 01:12:07.739
except you looked a little different

01:12:07.739 --> 01:12:08.906
in those days, Carjack.

01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:10.158
- You get one thing straight, Plissken.

01:12:10.158 --> 01:12:12.285
I'm no longer Carjack Malone.

01:12:12.285 --> 01:12:14.996
I'm Hershe Las Palmas, the most
drop-dead, to-die-for number

01:12:14.996 --> 01:12:16.330
you ever laid that one eye on.

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:17.165
- I don't give a fuck what you are.

01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:18.666
I want to know what the hell
happened to you in Cleveland.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.085
- I was called away on urgent business.

01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:21.294
I got caught, and you didn't.

01:12:21.294 --> 01:12:22.253
- Don't lie to me!

01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:23.338
- All right, so I made another deal.

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:24.756
I got my ass kicked, not you.

01:12:24.756 --> 01:12:26.257
I've been here five years, not you.

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:27.968
- I got a new deal for you.

01:12:27.968 --> 01:12:30.428
You help me, you live.

01:12:30.428 --> 01:12:31.804
- I wouldn't do that, Snake.

01:12:31.805 --> 01:12:32.889
You see, we all have an agreement.

01:12:32.889 --> 01:12:35.808
Anything happens to me, and you're dead.

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:37.185
- I'm already dead.

01:12:37.185 --> 01:12:39.020
(coughing)

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.355
- I see your point, what's the deal?

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:43.483
- [Snake] Get me to Cuervo
Jones, I got one hour.

01:12:43.483 --> 01:12:45.401
- Oh dream on, blue eye.

01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:46.611
- Say good night, Carjack.

01:12:46.611 --> 01:12:47.820
- Hold on!

01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:50.824
Cuervo Jones has more
firepower than two armies.

01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:52.158
No one gets near him.

01:12:52.158 --> 01:12:53.784
- And he's got the black box and the girl.

01:12:53.785 --> 01:12:54.786
He's running the show.

01:12:54.786 --> 01:12:55.828
- [Hershe] What black box?

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:58.373
- The one that shuts down
the power permanently.

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:00.750
- Oh, yeah, right, and
the Plutoxin Seven virus

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:03.711
is gonna kill you in
less than 10 hours, oh!

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:04.546
- What?

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:07.465
- It's bullshit, baby, rumor
control, government propaganda.

01:13:07.465 --> 01:13:08.674
Just one more lie.

01:13:09.634 --> 01:13:10.551
- Snake's telling the truth, Hershe.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:12.720
I used to represent the
guy who invented it.

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:14.806
Swear to God, Snake.

01:13:14.806 --> 01:13:17.809
- Hey, hey, what's the deal, gorgeous?

01:13:17.809 --> 01:13:19.352
- We get the girl and the black box,

01:13:19.352 --> 01:13:20.519
and we get out of here.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.354
- All of us?

01:13:24.774 --> 01:13:25.941
- Yeah.

01:13:25.942 --> 01:13:26.734
- Me, too?

01:13:27.694 --> 01:13:29.862
- Ha, why should we leave, I love LA.

01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:35.368
Where we gonna go, what's the big payoff?

01:13:35.368 --> 01:13:36.452
- The President's promised to give

01:13:36.453 --> 01:13:38.121
whoever helps me a million dollars.

01:13:38.121 --> 01:13:39.747
- Oh, yeah, a million greenbacks?

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:41.875
I got 10 million of them in the next room.

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:42.667
- Uh-uh.

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:44.919
Bluebacks.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.879
- Oh, come on, Snake.

01:13:45.879 --> 01:13:47.881
- Bluebacks, I swear to God, Eddie.

01:13:49.841 --> 01:13:51.759
This is bigger than Cleveland.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.844
- It sounds thin to me.

01:13:52.844 --> 01:13:56.138
- You want to stay here while
Cuervo Jones rules the world?

01:13:56.139 --> 01:13:57.557
- Hell no, that sucks.

01:13:58.683 --> 01:14:00.142
So how are we gonna get out?

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:04.605
- I'll tell you that when we get there.

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.525
- Oh, Plissken, now, you are such a loser!

01:14:07.525 --> 01:14:09.527
Man, making up shit along the way.

01:14:09.527 --> 01:14:11.111
That's why I left your ass in Cleveland.

01:14:11.112 --> 01:14:14.365
You're just a chump just
like the rest of us, no deal!

01:14:15.283 --> 01:14:16.534
- Government chopper.

01:14:17.911 --> 01:14:19.287
It'll be there.

01:14:19.287 --> 01:14:21.414
- OK, that's better.

01:14:21.414 --> 01:14:23.124
So how are we getting
there in under an hour?

01:14:23.124 --> 01:14:24.083
- That's your end.

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:27.587
(coughing)

01:14:29.422 --> 01:14:30.965
- Edward.

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:33.218
- The best you could do
from here is take the five.

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:35.386
The shape it's in, 2 1/2 hours minimum.

01:14:36.554 --> 01:14:38.931
- No, use the air, they're burning.

01:14:40.016 --> 01:14:41.100
The Santa Anas.

01:14:42.268 --> 01:14:43.894
The night wind.

01:14:43.895 --> 01:14:45.187
- What are you talking about?

01:14:45.188 --> 01:14:46.480
- Death from above.

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:52.361
(dramatic theme music)

01:15:03.081 --> 01:15:06.459
(background chattering)

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.420
- I don't know about these things.

01:15:09.421 --> 01:15:10.713
- [Hershe] You don't like it, don't come.

01:15:12.215 --> 01:15:14.467
- Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?

01:15:14.467 --> 01:15:16.886
- My name is Hershe, do
you understand, Plissken?

01:15:18.304 --> 01:15:19.555
- I got an idea.

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:21.224
Got any red nail polish on you?

01:15:21.224 --> 01:15:22.391
- What?

01:15:22.392 --> 01:15:23.184
- Come on.

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:28.648
(device beeping)

01:15:28.648 --> 01:15:30.608
- [Hershe] I expect that back, Eddie.

01:15:30.608 --> 01:15:31.400
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:37.657
There.

01:15:37.657 --> 01:15:40.826
It looks just like the sword
of Damocles instruction CD.

01:15:40.827 --> 01:15:42.954
Maybe we can pull a
Texas switch on Cuervo.

01:15:43.955 --> 01:15:46.040
- Yeah, if he lets you get close enough.

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:46.875
- Don't worry.

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.418
- [Gang Member] Let's do it!

01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:51.295
- The wind's up, come on, let's go!

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:55.383
Woo-hoo!

01:16:02.807 --> 01:16:03.599
- Ah!

01:16:12.817 --> 01:16:15.361
- [Computer] Neurosystem
shutdown, 34 minutes.

01:16:15.361 --> 01:16:19.239
(crowd shouting and clamoring)

01:16:23.036 --> 01:16:25.663
(upbeat music)

01:16:39.052 --> 01:16:43.014
(crowd shouting and clamoring)

01:16:43.014 --> 01:16:46.392
(automatic guns firing)

01:16:52.065 --> 01:16:55.610
- [Crowd] Cuervo, Cuervo, Cuervo, Cuervo!

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:59.447
Cuervo, Cuervo, Cuervo,
Cuervo, Cuervo, Cuervo!

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:03.159
Cuervo, Cuervo, Cuervo, Cuervo!

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:07.038
- Are you ready for the new world?

01:17:07.038 --> 01:17:10.082
(audience cheering)

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:13.252
The attack is now under way!

01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:17.089
(automatic guns firing)

01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:20.635
(suspenseful theme music)

01:17:39.863 --> 01:17:40.697
- What's going on?

01:17:40.697 --> 01:17:43.491
- [Pilot] I don't know,
I think we're fucked!

01:17:43.491 --> 01:17:45.159
(crowd clamoring)

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.744
- Get out here!

01:17:46.744 --> 01:17:48.120
Get out of there!

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.545
- You see Plissken anywhere?

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:01.050
- [Computer] Neurosystem
shutdown, 25 minutes.

01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:03.844
(crowd clamoring)

01:18:08.641 --> 01:18:10.100
Get my jet ready.

01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:11.560
Get it fueled and ready to go.

01:18:14.063 --> 01:18:16.482
- You can't run away now, it's too late.

01:18:17.442 --> 01:18:19.193
You have to stay and face it down.

01:18:20.111 --> 01:18:22.446
- Mr. President,
Commander, we are receiving

01:18:22.447 --> 01:18:23.948
reports from Miami.

01:18:23.948 --> 01:18:26.200
An armada of warships
has just departed Cuba.

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.328
ETA the Florida coast in 45 minutes.

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:29.871
- They're starting the invasion.

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:34.208
- I've got to go to my quarters!

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.001
I've got to pray!

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.589
- Go with him, make sure he
doesn't do anything crazy.

01:18:42.091 --> 01:18:45.552
(suspenseful theme music)

01:18:49.766 --> 01:18:52.393
(clock beeping)

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.107
- Hey, Eddie, is that what I think it is?

01:18:58.107 --> 01:19:01.401
- Yeah, the place kept changing owners.

01:19:01.402 --> 01:19:02.528
Finally went bankrupt.

01:19:03.863 --> 01:19:05.030
That thing in Paris killed them.

01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:07.116
- We're gonna need some kind of diversion.

01:19:11.996 --> 01:19:13.205
- Let's go.

01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:16.751
- Hey, Cuervo, hey!

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:18.627
Hey, Cuervo, I made it!

01:19:19.587 --> 01:19:21.297
I made it, wait for me, whoa!

01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:25.009
Oh, shit!

01:19:27.512 --> 01:19:30.223
(Eddie grunting)

01:19:31.224 --> 01:19:34.602
(crowd chattering)

01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:36.353
Hey, Cuervo!

01:19:36.354 --> 01:19:38.439
- Will you please kill him for me?

01:19:38.439 --> 01:19:40.023
- Hey, hey, I got news!

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:42.526
There's about to be an attack!

01:19:43.569 --> 01:19:44.903
You're about to get hit, man.

01:19:44.904 --> 01:19:46.030
It's Plissken.

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.865
- Plissken?

01:19:49.242 --> 01:19:50.993
You told me that you shot him dead.

01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:55.494
- Yeah, I thought I did, but
I found him sort of alive.

01:19:56.499 --> 01:19:58.083
- Sort of, where?

01:19:59.627 --> 01:20:00.502
- Oh, Cuervo.

01:20:00.503 --> 01:20:02.171
- [Cuervo] What?

01:20:02.171 --> 01:20:03.005
- It's so good to see you.

01:20:03.006 --> 01:20:04.007
- Where is Plissken?

01:20:06.092 --> 01:20:07.176
- [Eddie] He's near.

01:20:07.176 --> 01:20:08.844
- You're stalling, Eddie.

01:20:08.845 --> 01:20:10.680
- Ah, jeez!

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.516
- Talk, gringo, or I'll
rip your balls off.

01:20:14.767 --> 01:20:15.851
- Oh, look out behind you!

01:20:15.852 --> 01:20:18.396
(men shouting)

01:20:25.445 --> 01:20:28.156
(men chattering)

01:20:33.619 --> 01:20:36.663
- You have lied to me
for the very last time.

01:20:36.664 --> 01:20:37.498
(loud exploding)

01:20:37.498 --> 01:20:38.832
(woman screaming)

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.167
(crowd clamoring)

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:42.253
(guns firing)

01:20:42.253 --> 01:20:45.714
(suspenseful theme music)

01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:51.762
(guns firing)

01:21:04.567 --> 01:21:07.027
(guns firing)

01:21:24.754 --> 01:21:28.299
(suspenseful theme music)

01:21:45.525 --> 01:21:47.735
(grunting)

01:21:57.328 --> 01:21:59.872
(guns firing)

01:22:05.878 --> 01:22:09.256
(Snake shouting in pain)

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:16.305
(suspenseful theme music)

01:22:48.921 --> 01:22:51.715

01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:27.877
(automatic guns firing)

01:23:27.877 --> 01:23:30.170
- Come on, hurry up, let's go!

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:33.549
(automatic guns firing)

01:23:38.846 --> 01:23:41.849
- Get inside the chopper,
it's bulletproof.

01:23:46.896 --> 01:23:48.939
I'll take my coat back now, asshole.

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:08.709
- Take me back, Snake.

01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:09.835
- Secure the latch.

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:15.049
- Oh, you got the remote, great.

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:17.301
- Yeah, now give me the real one.

01:24:17.301 --> 01:24:18.844
- What, I didn't make a switch.

01:24:18.844 --> 01:24:20.971
- Yes, you did, I saw you.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:25.935
- Give me that gun!

01:24:31.107 --> 01:24:31.899
Ah!

01:24:33.651 --> 01:24:36.945
(dramatic theme music)

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:59.551
- Carjack, we're hooked up on your side.

01:25:01.971 --> 01:25:05.516
(suspenseful theme music)

01:25:29.582 --> 01:25:30.499
- I hit him!

01:25:30.499 --> 01:25:33.210
(Eddie giggling)

01:25:36.756 --> 01:25:37.548
Oh, whoa!

01:25:41.552 --> 01:25:43.845
(screaming)

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.230
(suspenseful theme music)

01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:53.980
Hey!

01:25:57.443 --> 01:25:59.486
Get back here, Plissken!

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.614
- [Officer] Aircraft is
entering quadrant four, sir.

01:26:01.614 --> 01:26:03.198
I'm getting radio contact.

01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:04.074
- Boost it.

01:26:04.075 --> 01:26:05.576
- Malloy.

01:26:05.576 --> 01:26:07.911
Get the antidote ready,
assholes, I'm coming in.

01:26:07.912 --> 01:26:09.914
- This is Malloy, Plissken,
do you have the back box?

01:26:09.914 --> 01:26:11.415
- I got what was in it.

01:26:11.415 --> 01:26:13.542
Remote control unit and instruction disk.

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:16.211
Get the trucks rolling, we're on fire.

01:26:16.212 --> 01:26:17.379
- [Computer] Neurosystem shutdown,

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:19.256
two minutes and 27 seconds.

01:26:19.256 --> 01:26:21.174
- [PA] All emergency vehicles proceed

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.509
to the north perimeter.

01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:31.810
- Shit, Shit!

01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:37.816
(suspenseful theme music)

01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:40.110
- [PA] This is a full alert.

01:26:42.905 --> 01:26:45.240
- Where the hell is he going?

01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:48.869
- Get ready to jump.

01:26:48.869 --> 01:26:52.622
Head for the tree line and disappear.

01:26:52.623 --> 01:26:54.041
Go.

01:26:54.041 --> 01:26:54.833
Go!

01:26:56.752 --> 01:27:00.046
(suspenseful theme music)

01:27:00.047 --> 01:27:01.173
- [Utopia] Oh!

01:27:04.093 --> 01:27:05.135
Oh!

01:27:05.136 --> 01:27:07.930
(Utopia grunting)

01:27:08.889 --> 01:27:12.350
(suspenseful theme music)

01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:44.258
(men chattering)

01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:49.596
(Snake coughing)

01:27:57.229 --> 01:28:00.357
- Oh, oh, thank God Almighty!

01:28:00.357 --> 01:28:01.608
Thank God Almighty!

01:28:02.651 --> 01:28:04.861
Welcome back, Snake.

01:28:04.862 --> 01:28:06.154
- Give me the goddamn shot.

01:28:11.118 --> 01:28:13.995
(beeping)

01:28:13.996 --> 01:28:14.997
- [Computer] Your countdown clock

01:28:14.997 --> 01:28:16.957
has now terminated function.

01:28:16.957 --> 01:28:18.041
Your time is up.

01:28:19.585 --> 01:28:22.462
(chuckling)

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:24.214
- I told you he was dumb.

01:28:24.215 --> 01:28:25.799
- You took the fake, hotshot.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.636
- Plutoxin Seven is a fast,
hard-hitting case of the flu.

01:28:31.764 --> 01:28:33.307
- Pretty good.

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:37.269
- Relax, war hero, we took
you for a little ride,

01:28:37.269 --> 01:28:39.229
and you came through.

01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:41.232
Now, give me that unit.

01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:52.325
- You want this thing?

01:28:53.786 --> 01:28:54.995
Come and get it.

01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:58.374
- Sir.

01:28:58.374 --> 01:28:59.291
- What can he do?

01:29:00.376 --> 01:29:04.876
- Let go of me, quit it!

01:29:10.427 --> 01:29:12.595
- You didn't finish the mission, Snake.

01:29:14.223 --> 01:29:16.225
Looks like I'll have to do it for you.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.402
- Hold it, Mr. President.

01:29:44.336 --> 01:29:45.128
- Shit.

01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:52.010
- We'll take this one.

01:30:04.607 --> 01:30:06.317
- Get her out of here.

01:30:06.317 --> 01:30:07.109
- Daddy.

01:30:08.068 --> 01:30:09.402
- Take her to the chair.

01:30:17.244 --> 01:30:19.537
For he so loved his country,

01:30:20.873 --> 01:30:23.542
he gave his only seditious child.

01:30:28.797 --> 01:30:31.132
Prepare to broadcast worldwide.

01:30:35.387 --> 01:30:36.137
Worldwide!

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:41.393
- She didn't know that
she had that remote unit

01:30:41.393 --> 01:30:42.727
in her pocket, now, did she?

01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:46.105
I was wondering what kind of lame switch

01:30:46.106 --> 01:30:48.858
you'd try to pull this time, Plissken.

01:30:48.859 --> 01:30:50.902
You know, you're becoming
very predictable.

01:30:52.821 --> 01:30:53.780
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:30:55.574 --> 01:30:57.242
- You got a smoke?

01:30:57.242 --> 01:30:59.953
- The United States is
a nonsmoking nation.

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:02.748
No smoking, no drinking,
no drugs, no women.

01:31:02.748 --> 01:31:04.458
Unless, of course, you're married.

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:07.586
No guns, no foul language, no red meat.

01:31:08.837 --> 01:31:10.713
- The land of the free.

01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:16.553
- I don't need the teleprompter.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.516
This is the President
of the United States.

01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:25.016
I now demand an immediate
retreat of all forces

01:31:25.104 --> 01:31:28.357
now threatening this great nation.

01:31:28.357 --> 01:31:31.651
If my demand is not met immediately,

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:36.152
I will destroy your ability
to function permanently.

01:31:37.366 --> 01:31:38.617
- Mr. President, the Cuban Theater

01:31:38.617 --> 01:31:40.327
of Aggression remains mobile.

01:31:40.327 --> 01:31:41.661
ETA, Miami in four minutes.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:42.454
- Four minutes.

01:31:43.455 --> 01:31:47.542
Bring the aiming coordinates
for Cuba and Mexico on line.

01:31:50.796 --> 01:31:53.715
- Cuba, seven, seven, nine.

01:31:53.716 --> 01:31:54.508
- Seven.

01:31:55.592 --> 01:31:57.093
Seven.

01:31:57.094 --> 01:31:57.886
Nine.

01:32:00.097 --> 01:32:04.059
I now render this final solution.

01:32:06.645 --> 01:32:09.856
- [Eddie] Welcome to your
very own map to the stars.

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:12.401
Sure, we all know the big one wiped out

01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:14.569
the entertainment industry here in LA,

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:17.656
but the glamor and excitement
of Hollywood is still alive.

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:19.324
- Very funny.

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:22.327
- Yeah.

01:32:22.327 --> 01:32:23.703
- I hope it was worth it,

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.540
for now you are going to die.

01:32:28.459 --> 01:32:30.169
- Everybody does.

01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:34.669
- Kill him and bring me the real unit.

01:32:35.382 --> 01:32:36.800
- Sir, we're still broadcasting.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.468
- Good, let them watch!

01:32:41.013 --> 01:32:41.805
Do it!

01:32:45.225 --> 01:32:46.017
Do it!

01:32:48.187 --> 01:32:49.479
- On my command!

01:32:52.608 --> 01:32:53.400
Fire!

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.965
- He's not even here, he's a hologram!

01:33:19.426 --> 01:33:21.094
- Catches on quick, doesn't she?

01:33:22.971 --> 01:33:25.306
- Got to be within a half-mile radius.

01:33:25.307 --> 01:33:26.725
Round up every available man.

01:33:26.725 --> 01:33:27.517
- Hold it.

01:33:29.353 --> 01:33:30.812
- [Brazen] Sir, the enemy
is less than two minutes

01:33:30.813 --> 01:33:31.605
from our shore.

01:33:32.898 --> 01:33:35.817
- What's it to be, Plissken, us or them?

01:33:38.403 --> 01:33:41.155
- Shut down the Third
World, they lose, you win.

01:33:42.407 --> 01:33:45.993
Shut down America, you lose, they win.

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:50.415
The more things change, the
more they stay the same.

01:33:52.376 --> 01:33:54.961
- So what are you going to do?

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:55.963
- Disappear.

01:34:03.637 --> 01:34:06.264
(device beeping)

01:34:06.265 --> 01:34:07.683
- He's entered the word code.

01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:13.104
No target code.

01:34:17.776 --> 01:34:19.903
Sir, that will shut
down the entire planet.

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:24.616
- I told you you'd better
hope I didn't make it back.

01:34:25.617 --> 01:34:28.745
- You push that button,
everything we've accomplished

01:34:28.745 --> 01:34:32.039
for the past 500 years will be finished.

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:35.585
Our technology, our way of
life, our entire history.

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:38.547
We'll have to start all over again.

01:34:41.967 --> 01:34:43.593
For God sakes, don't do it, Snake!

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:48.265
- The name's Plissken.

01:34:50.392 --> 01:34:53.353
(bluesy band music)

01:35:06.241 --> 01:35:09.202
- He did it, he shut down the Earth.

01:35:22.591 --> 01:35:25.552
(bluesy band music)

01:36:02.547 --> 01:36:05.258
(sparking match)

01:36:29.825 --> 01:36:31.743
- [Snake] Welcome to the human race.
