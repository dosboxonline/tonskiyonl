<i>I am the police.
And I'm here to arrest you.</i>

00:40.795 --> 00:43.966
<i>You've broken the law.
I did not write the law.</i>

00:44.045 --> 00:47.636
<i>I may even disagree with the law.
But I will enforce it.</i>

00:47.711 --> 00:49.711
<i>No matter how you plead, cajole, beg</i>

00:49.795 --> 00:51.716
<i>or attempt to stir my sympathies,</i>

00:51.795 --> 00:54.091
<i>nothing you do will stop me

<i>in a steel cage with gray bars.</i>

00:56.503 --> 00:58.424

I will chase you.</i>

00:58.503 --> 01:00.629
<i>If you fight me,
I will fight back.</i>

01:00.711 --> 01:03.382
<i>If you shoot at me,
I will shoot back.</i>

01:03.878 --> 01:06.254
<i>By law, I am unable to walk away.</i>

01:06.336 --> 01:09.507
<i>I'm a consequence.
I am the unpaid bill.</i>

01:09.586 --> 01:11.803
<i>I am fate with a badge and a gun.</i>

01:12.461 --> 01:14.632
<i>Behind my badge is a heart like yours.</i>

01:15.336 --> 01:19.008
<i>I bleed. I think. I love.</i>

01:19.545 --> 01:21.841
<i>And, yes, I can be killed.</i>

01:22.670 --> 01:24.921
<i>And although I am but one man,</i>

01:25.003 --> 01:27.844
<i>I have thousands of brothers and sisters
who are the same as me.</i>

01:28.837 --> 01:32.259
<i>They will lay down their lives for me.
And I them.</i>

01:32.962 --> 01:34.507
<i>We stand watch together.</i>

01:35.045 --> 01:36.511
<i>A thin blue line.</i>

01:36.670 --> 01:39.012
<i>Protecting the prey from the predators.</i>

01:39.087 --> 01:40.837
<i>The good from the bad.</i>

01:41.294 --> 01:43.340
<i>We are the police.</i>

01:48.503 --> 01:52.345
<i>13 X-ray 9 is in pursuit
of a Code 37 vehicle west on 2-7.</i>

01:52.753 --> 01:56.299
Go ahead, motherfucker.
Try to run, you son of a bitch.

01:57.212 --> 01:58.382
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

01:58.461 --> 02:01.382
Eastbound through the alley
at 20 hundred block from Hooper.

02:01.461 --> 02:02.757
<i>Now eastbound through the alley</i>

02:02.837 --> 02:04.076
<i>at 20 hundred block from Hooper.</i>

02:04.170 --> 02:05.420
Oh, shit!

02:05.503 --> 02:07.503
Come around, come around, dude!
Come around!

02:07.586 --> 02:09.632
Move! Move! Move!
Get the fuck around, dude!

02:12.003 --> 02:14.378
<i>Pull to the right!
Pull to the right!</i>

02:14.461 --> 02:16.260
Bro, he's not gonna pull to the right.

02:17.711 --> 02:19.336
You stupid motherfucker!

02:20.129 --> 02:21.504
Man, he almost lost it!

02:24.170 --> 02:25.886
Pit him, man! Pit him, pit him!

02:26.628 --> 02:27.778
Got him!

02:35.795 --> 02:37.091
Fuck you!

02:46.087 --> 02:48.087
- You good?
- Good, good, good.

02:48.962 --> 02:51.054
This fucker's down.
I'm going to hook him.

02:58.545 --> 02:59.695
You're all good.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.511
<i>13 X-ray 9, you can show a Code 4.</i>

03:02.586 --> 03:04.007
<i>13 X 9 requesting</i>

03:04.087 --> 03:07.428
<i>additional supervisors

03:11.670 --> 03:13.012
Holy shit.

03:15.962 --> 03:19.258
All right. This is my day job.
Some of you...

03:19.336 --> 03:20.427
Sorry, bro, I'm recording.

03:20.503 --> 03:23.504
This is my day job.
Some of you might know me as Brian.

03:23.586 --> 03:25.302
Or Taylor.

03:25.378 --> 03:28.504
But here I am Police Officer Two Brian Taylor.

03:28.795 --> 03:31.137
This is where the forces of good

03:31.211 --> 03:33.928
prepare to fight the forces of evil.

03:34.211 --> 03:36.803
This is my partner, Officer Zavala.

03:36.878 --> 03:37.878
I'm in my <i>chones,</i> dude.

03:38.003 --> 03:39.548
- I know, dude, come on, come on.
- I'm in my <i>chones.</i> No.

03:39.628 --> 03:40.799
- Come on, man.
- I'm good, bro.

03:40.878 --> 03:43.004
We work basic patrol here at Newton.

03:43.087 --> 03:45.178
One of the toughest divisions in the LAPD.

03:45.253 --> 03:47.674
Shootin' Newton, baby, that's right.
Lucky 13.

03:47.837 --> 03:50.337
This is a department-issue sidearm.
Glock 19.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.841
Spyderco tactical knife.

03:54.670 --> 03:57.341
This little thing can break windows, here.

03:59.336 --> 04:01.507
Two Smith & Wesson handcuffs.

04:02.253 --> 04:04.549
Can of OC spray. Pepper spray.

04:04.753 --> 04:06.424
Two extra mags.

04:06.586 --> 04:08.507
What else? That's my name-tag, here.

04:08.586 --> 04:10.712
You can see my partner's dirty locker.

04:10.795 --> 04:12.386
Yours is like a woman.
Look at this.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.677
What is this, Pottery Barn?

04:13.878 --> 04:16.719
Are you gonna shut the fuck up
and get ready for roll call?

04:16.962 --> 04:19.678
Dude, don't swear, man.
I have to edit that out, when you swear.

04:19.795 --> 04:23.170
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit, dude.
Fuck, man.

04:23.670 --> 04:25.046
Okay, now in Spanish.

04:26.837 --> 04:28.553
Hey. You kids having fun?

04:28.628 --> 04:30.378
Oh, look, it's Officer Van Hauser.

04:30.628 --> 04:32.628
Officer Three. Van Hauser.

04:33.128 --> 04:35.470
Considered un-promotable by the department.

04:35.586 --> 04:37.958
And the angriest fucking cop in the world.

04:38.503 --> 04:40.970
Taylor, I'm gonna tell Sarge
that you're taping in here.

04:41.045 --> 04:42.045
- What'd you say?
- What?

04:42.128 --> 04:45.050
I'm gonna tell Sarge
that you're taping in here.

04:46.003 --> 04:48.378
Yeah, well, it's not really
called taping any more.

04:48.461 --> 04:50.219
It uses flash cards,
but it's not really a...

04:50.628 --> 04:51.594
Don't worry about it.

04:51.670 --> 04:52.820
God damn it!

04:53.003 --> 04:54.378
Hold up, hold up.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.611
Like that?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.012
Turn it on.

04:57.545 --> 04:59.216
So, am I recording you?

04:59.294 --> 05:00.761
Yes, dude, and I'm recording you.

05:01.211 --> 05:02.302
Oh, that's so cool.

05:02.378 --> 05:03.879
- See that thing there?
- Yeah.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.253
That is the lens right there.

05:05.336 --> 05:06.928
Just like that on that,
this right here.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.243
Hey, guys, quiet down.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.589
All right, let's settle down.
Let's settle down.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.591
Captain's here, he'd like to say a few words.
Let's quiet down.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.068
Thank you, Sergeant. Good afternoon.

05:17.086 --> 05:18.365
- Good afternoon.
- Put it down.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.427
I'd like to welcome back Zavala and Taylor.

05:21.211 --> 05:23.211
DA cleared these guys
in last month's shooting.

05:23.294 --> 05:24.966
Turned out to be a good shooting.

05:25.045 --> 05:26.803
I know first-hand what you guys went through.

05:26.878 --> 05:29.275
It's an unpleasant experience
being under that much scrutiny.

05:30.169 --> 05:31.466
But you need to remember something.

05:31.503 --> 05:34.595
An on-the-job shooting
is still considered a homicide.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.670
It's never an easy ride.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.629
If you do the right thing,
I will always have your back.

05:40.711 --> 05:42.131
Do the wrong thing and cross me,

05:42.211 --> 05:44.507
I will personally throw you under the bus.

05:44.962 --> 05:46.803
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

05:46.878 --> 05:48.423
- Taylor, am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

05:48.503 --> 05:50.299
- Sergeant, am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

05:50.378 --> 05:52.378
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you, Captain.

05:57.503 --> 06:01.379
Quiet down! See this?
It's a ticket book.

06:01.878 --> 06:03.594
Inside are things called tickets.

06:03.670 --> 06:04.716
Son of a bitch.

06:04.795 --> 06:07.591
You can do things like
stop motorists and cut citations

06:07.670 --> 06:09.591
for speeding or going through alight.

06:09.795 --> 06:11.386
You all need to write.

06:11.461 --> 06:12.795
Sarge, we cut citations every watch.

06:12.837 --> 06:15.035
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to these two idiots.

06:15.086 --> 06:16.758
- My partner has a question.
- Yes.

06:16.837 --> 06:18.257
I don't really know how to write.

06:19.628 --> 06:22.469
But I do sign and draw pictures.

06:22.545 --> 06:24.261
Seriously, you don't start writing,

06:24.336 --> 06:26.052
Captain's gonna shit on my head

06:26.128 --> 06:27.946
and in turn, I'm gonna shit on your head.

06:28.420 --> 06:31.136
And I promise you,
you guys are gonna be separated.

06:31.211 --> 06:32.302
Do it, Sarge.

06:32.378 --> 06:34.003
Orozco and Davis, X 25.

06:34.086 --> 06:36.587
Peterson and Washington, X 41.

06:36.670 --> 06:39.341
Zavala and Taylor, you got X 13.

06:39.586 --> 06:41.086
Williams and Cho, X 8.

06:41.169 --> 06:45.045
Alameda and Green, X 21.
Van Hauser and Sook, X 4.

06:45.128 --> 06:47.424
Yeah, Sarge? That's not our area.

06:47.503 --> 06:49.299
- That's not your area?
- No, we work 9.

06:49.378 --> 06:53.220
Oh, I'm sorry, fellas. Oh, no, you're right.
You're on X 13.

06:53.545 --> 06:55.090
Sorry, fellas, this isn't Monopoly.

06:55.169 --> 06:56.590
You don't get to choose your real estate.

06:56.670 --> 06:58.170
Now go. Get out.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.344
Zavala, try not to kill anybody
before the end of the watch.

07:02.420 --> 07:03.762
Really, Sarge?

07:03.837 --> 07:06.428
Sarge, if we kill someone in X 13,
can we go back to X 9?

07:07.420 --> 07:08.859
Today is a brand new day.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.466
Get the shop, gas the shop, wash the shop.

07:11.545 --> 07:14.216
Make sure day watch didn't leave behind
any surprises for us.

07:14.336 --> 07:15.837
Look for guns, drugs, puke.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.090
Pay attention, Boot.

07:17.169 --> 07:18.590
- Goodbye. Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

07:18.670 --> 07:19.886
How you doing, Van Hauser?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.132
I warned you about that shit.

07:21.211 --> 07:22.693
Where you running with that piece, Boot?

07:22.837 --> 07:24.335
What? Why you so scared?

07:24.336 --> 07:25.961
- Go, go! Jesus Christ!
- Go on, shit.

07:26.086 --> 07:27.928
- Jesus!
- It's like it's day one.

07:28.128 --> 07:29.969
- Boot, slow down with that piece.
- Slow down!

07:30.044 --> 07:31.215
Orozco, have you been working out?

07:31.294 --> 07:34.261
Yeah, with your morn.
Why are you shooting everything?

07:34.420 --> 07:35.671
It's for his class.

07:36.002 --> 07:37.241
I thought you were studying law.

07:37.628 --> 07:38.867
Pre-law. I need an art elective.

07:39.044 --> 07:40.420
I'm taking filmmaking.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.779
Well, get my good side.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.321
You don't have a good side.

07:44.253 --> 07:46.049
Listen, you know they can subpoena that shit

07:46.128 --> 07:47.845
if something goes sideways, right?

07:48.253 --> 07:49.253
Think twice.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.086
Two words. Erase button.

07:51.169 --> 07:52.608
Two words. Just 'cause you guys think

07:52.670 --> 07:54.045
you're these big ghetto gunfighters now,

07:54.128 --> 07:55.767
don't mean you can be
dropping your calls.

07:55.878 --> 07:57.298
That was at least two dozen words.

07:57.378 --> 07:58.923
Yeah, well, I barely got a GED,

07:59.002 --> 08:00.548
so what do you expect, white boy?

08:00.795 --> 08:01.965
Unbelievable.

08:02.044 --> 08:04.295
Saddle up, ladies, we're sick
of holding up your end.

08:04.378 --> 08:05.528
Admit it, you'd hit that shit.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.086
- Orozco?
- Yeah.

08:07.169 --> 08:08.841
With a cinderblock.

08:08.919 --> 08:10.465
Check the roof, Boot.

08:10.545 --> 08:11.796
Where's your shop?

08:12.628 --> 08:14.469
I got Red Bull, Monster and...

08:14.545 --> 08:16.216
They all say 13, check the roof.

08:16.294 --> 08:17.761
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Faster, Boot, let's go.

08:17.837 --> 08:19.007
- Get in the car!
- Yes, sir!

08:19.086 --> 08:20.132
And then I got you some <i>kombucha</i>

08:20.211 --> 08:21.257
'cause I know you like that stuff.

08:21.336 --> 08:24.337
Fuck that shit! What is that?

09:11.128 --> 09:13.549
Dude, it's good to be back, man.

09:13.628 --> 09:17.003
Old lady was driving me crazy at the <i>casa,</i>
like making me do shit.

09:17.086 --> 09:20.087
Oh, no! She dared ask for your help
around the house.

09:20.169 --> 09:22.420
That's incredible. Outrageous.

09:22.503 --> 09:25.049
Just 'cause I look like
the dudes from Home Depot,

09:25.128 --> 09:27.220
doesn't mean I do the shit
the Home Depot dudes do.

09:27.420 --> 09:28.420
I would never profile you

09:28.503 --> 09:29.549
as a man who helps his wife with chores.

09:29.628 --> 09:30.594
Shut up.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.750
Dude, I'm your homie, okay?

09:31.795 --> 09:33.342
I would never, ever do that.

09:34.586 --> 09:35.877
Oh, bro!

09:36.586 --> 09:38.336
Her brother was always coming over

09:38.420 --> 09:40.762
during the day to swim. Every day.

09:41.211 --> 09:42.836
I hate everything about him.

09:42.919 --> 09:44.215
He smells like weed sometimes.

09:44.294 --> 09:45.795
Like he's got, like, a prescription.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.674
And Gabby was like,
"No, it's all good."

09:47.753 --> 09:49.378
I was like,
"Whatever, get him the hell out of here."

09:49.545 --> 09:52.045
I swear to God,
I'm filling in that pool with cement.

09:52.128 --> 09:53.253
Not personally, 'cause you'll hire

09:53.336 --> 09:54.461
a Home Depot dude for that task.

09:54.545 --> 09:55.920
Fuck you.

09:57.211 --> 10:00.758
<i>13 X 13, 4-15 man at 9742 Maple.</i>

10:00.836 --> 10:03.713
<i>Code 2. Incident 4-5-6-2.</i>

10:04.253 --> 10:06.003
13 X 13. Roger, show us en route.

10:06.086 --> 10:07.257
<i>X 13, roger.</i>

10:07.336 --> 10:08.382
First customer of the day.

10:08.461 --> 10:10.881
I hope they enjoy our police service.

10:20.002 --> 10:22.798
Suck my dick!
That motherfucker's a lying-ass nigga.

10:22.877 --> 10:24.549
Fuck him and fuck you, too!

10:24.628 --> 10:26.594
Shut your fucking... if you touch me,
I will fucking shoot you.

10:26.670 --> 10:27.760
Stay where you are.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.462
I don't give a fuck
about both you motherfuckers.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.136
I'm ready to die today. Fuck y'all.

10:31.211 --> 10:32.849
This can go one of several ways right now.

10:32.919 --> 10:34.636
It is all about your attitude.

10:34.794 --> 10:36.420
Fuck you! I got my mail!

10:36.503 --> 10:37.594
I helped him!

10:37.670 --> 10:40.170
I helped him give me my mail!
I'm getting tired of this shit!

10:40.420 --> 10:41.636
- All right.
- I'm not playing with y'all.

10:41.711 --> 10:42.961
Sir, if you've been drinking,

10:43.044 --> 10:44.760
you need to stay the fuck inside

10:44.836 --> 10:46.475
and not intimidate the mailman.
That's it.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.295
Fuck you! You need to shut the fuck up!

10:48.378 --> 10:50.094
'Cause without that badge and gun,
you ain't shit.

10:50.169 --> 10:52.215
- Yeah?
- You're less than motherfucking nothing.

10:52.336 --> 10:53.881
- You motherfucking, border-hopping...
- Oh, yeah?

10:54.002 --> 10:55.548
Donkey-riding, Mexican motherfucker.

10:55.628 --> 10:57.720
Is that so?
You want to find out what I'm about?

10:57.836 --> 10:59.836
- Show me! Yeah, I wanna see!
- Fuck.

10:59.919 --> 11:01.716
Let's settle this right here
like grown men, motherfucker!

11:01.794 --> 11:02.840
Not again, man.

11:02.919 --> 11:04.919
What'd you say? You wanna take a fade?
You want to fight me?

11:05.002 --> 11:06.674
Yeah, I want to fight you.
Let's go, bro.

11:06.752 --> 11:08.969
I whoop your punk ass,
you gonna get the fuck up out of my crib?

11:09.044 --> 11:11.295
Hell, no. But you called me out, bro!

11:11.378 --> 11:12.969
Now I'm calling you out!
What's up?

11:13.044 --> 11:14.295
You whoop my ass,

11:14.378 --> 11:17.345
I'll put them motherfucking handcuffs
on my motherfucking self.

11:17.420 --> 11:18.715
- And that's on the set.
- Door.

11:18.794 --> 11:19.885
It's gonna be a pleasure beating

11:19.961 --> 11:21.428
your bitch ass. My fucking fantasy.

11:21.503 --> 11:23.219
I don't know who the fuck you think
you're fucking with,

11:23.294 --> 11:25.257
but I love this shit.
Beatin' a motherfucking punk-ass

11:25.336 --> 11:26.966
- police-ass like yours.
- Keep talking, bro.

11:27.002 --> 11:29.000
Let's get this shit popping, motherfucker.

11:40.586 --> 11:41.736
Shit.

11:45.794 --> 11:46.944
This shit's crazy!

11:54.294 --> 11:57.669
Fucking kick his ass!
Come on! Come on, Z! Z!

12:04.378 --> 12:05.629
Yo, Z! Z! Z!

12:06.836 --> 12:09.178
Now get the fuck up.
You like that?

12:09.503 --> 12:10.549
This ain't no wrassling match.

12:10.628 --> 12:12.844
You all right? You all right?
You all right?

12:12.919 --> 12:14.069
Come on!

12:16.836 --> 12:18.178
Oh, shit!

12:19.586 --> 12:20.961
Come on, man!

12:23.710 --> 12:26.131
That's what happens when you fuck
with the police.

12:30.169 --> 12:32.545
Yeah, come on. Take him! Take him!
Take him! Take him!

12:32.628 --> 12:35.844
Fuck you, border-hopping motherfucker!

12:43.461 --> 12:45.461
Fucking did that shit.

12:47.752 --> 12:48.902
You all right?

12:49.128 --> 12:50.424
Give me the hooks.

13:09.420 --> 13:10.570
What's up, <i>putos?</i>

13:10.752 --> 13:13.878
It's big bad Wicked from Curbside Gang <i>Locos.</i>

13:14.253 --> 13:15.628
You ready for this shit?

13:15.710 --> 13:18.257
Fuck, yeah. I was born
to fucking do this shit.

13:18.877 --> 13:21.094
Show these motherfuckers
whose <i>barrio</i> this is.

13:21.169 --> 13:22.448
You almost ran the light, stupid.

13:22.503 --> 13:23.836
You're gonna get us pulled over, La.

13:23.877 --> 13:26.298
Fuck that shit.
I gotta fucking be at work.

13:26.585 --> 13:29.257
You better not bust out
wasting my motherfucking time, homie,

13:29.336 --> 13:30.854
I'm gonna tell you that shit right now.

13:30.961 --> 13:32.802
Hey, La La, when you gonna fuck the homeboy?

13:33.836 --> 13:35.257
I'm not fucking the homeboy, dawg.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.336
Yeah, right.

13:36.420 --> 13:37.590
Shit, what I look like?

13:37.669 --> 13:40.295
The little fucking <i>paisa</i> hoochies
you guys fucking kick it with?

13:40.836 --> 13:41.927
What you packing, baby?

13:42.002 --> 13:45.469
I'm packing a motherfucking 30-round clip
for these slob-ass niggas.

13:45.545 --> 13:46.695
This is it right here, man.

13:46.752 --> 13:48.012
Slow down, this is the street, La.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.169
This is it. This is it. All right.

13:49.253 --> 13:51.345
Wicked, you're gonna jump
and get the party started, got it?

13:51.420 --> 13:52.466
I got you, baby.

13:52.545 --> 13:53.695
Listen to the homie.

13:53.752 --> 13:55.253
All right, put your fucking face on, let's go!

13:55.336 --> 13:56.486
Get your shit ready.

13:56.545 --> 13:57.840
Put that fucking shit away!

13:57.919 --> 13:59.295
Make sure your fucking shit
is good to go.

13:59.378 --> 14:00.798
What the fuck do I gotta fucking tell you?

14:00.877 --> 14:02.923
I don't want to fucking have
to baby you, man!

14:04.169 --> 14:05.289
Get ready, homies. Get ready.

14:05.336 --> 14:06.881
- Get your face on!
- All right. Fuck.

14:07.044 --> 14:09.010
- You guys ready?
- Ready.

14:09.128 --> 14:10.278
All right.

14:11.669 --> 14:14.136
But on some real shit, dawg,
I'm gonna have to holler at you, B.

14:14.211 --> 14:16.286
Niggas keep on talking about
how you got your ass whooped

14:16.336 --> 14:17.892
by a motherfucking little punk-ass wonton.

14:17.961 --> 14:19.757
Nah, Blood, these niggas is hating.

14:19.836 --> 14:22.757
Let me tell you something.
Me and the cop got down, right?

14:22.836 --> 14:25.882
Motherfucker took off his badge,
dropped his gun.

14:25.961 --> 14:27.212
I mean, he kept it gangster.

14:27.294 --> 14:29.340
We straight-up squabbled. Head up.

14:29.420 --> 14:30.920
But they still took you
to the county though, huh?

14:31.002 --> 14:32.968
Yeah, but for disorderly conduct.

14:33.044 --> 14:34.715
Not for squabbling with the police,
you feel me?

14:34.794 --> 14:36.128
You fought a cop and they didn't put

14:36.169 --> 14:37.420
no "assault on a peace officer" on you?

14:37.503 --> 14:39.421
Listen to me, my nigga.
I'm trying to tell y'all.

14:39.627 --> 14:41.424
They really showed me love to keep it G.

14:41.502 --> 14:43.548
I'm a two-time felon, right?
Y'all know that, right?

14:43.627 --> 14:45.094
Could have struck me out and gave me life

14:45.169 --> 14:46.669
for fighting that cop, you feel me?

14:46.752 --> 14:47.991
I got right out, it wasn't shit.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.511
All right, but we heard
you got your ass beat, Blood.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.427
You better shut the fuck up, CK.

14:52.502 --> 14:54.781
I'll run this fucking fork up in your ass,
I swear to God.

14:54.836 --> 14:56.275
Let me tell you something,

14:56.294 --> 14:58.589
win, lose or draw,

14:58.669 --> 15:00.170
as long as you squabble and get down,

15:00.502 --> 15:02.128
that's gangster,
you understand what I'm saying?

15:02.211 --> 15:03.211
Yup.

15:03.294 --> 15:05.669
I mean, that Mexican cop
might be acting bull with you, Tre.

15:05.752 --> 15:08.502
But he's still out there killing niggas.
Straight out.

15:08.585 --> 15:10.836
No, no, no.
Listen to me, all y'all.

15:10.919 --> 15:13.590
This whole fucking thing
is like changing of the guard.

15:13.669 --> 15:16.341
Back in the day,
all these neighborhoods used to be black,

15:16.420 --> 15:17.570
and what are they now?

15:17.627 --> 15:19.094
- Mexicans.
- Exactly.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.249
There used to be chicken stands on the corner,

15:21.294 --> 15:23.172
now there's fucking <i>taco</i>
stands on every corner.

15:23.336 --> 15:25.086
We're in some real shit
and if we don't come together,

15:25.169 --> 15:26.635
we're gonna be some extinct niggas pretty soon.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.229
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

15:42.336 --> 15:43.486
Go, go, go!

15:50.919 --> 15:53.715
Get CK, Blood! Get CK!

15:54.169 --> 15:55.319
Fuck!

15:56.169 --> 15:58.885
Fuck, yeah! We got those <i>putos</i>!
We got 'em!

16:00.044 --> 16:01.760
Eat shit, motherfuckers!

16:01.961 --> 16:04.007
- Fuck!
- We fucking lit 'em up, dawg!

16:04.086 --> 16:07.303
Show those <i>putos</i> whose neighborhood
this fucker is! Shit.

16:07.378 --> 16:08.969
Fucking proud of you, man.

16:09.044 --> 16:11.136
And that's what I'm fucking telling you. Good.

16:11.378 --> 16:13.711
That was fucking good, man.
That's what I'm fucking telling you.

16:13.877 --> 16:15.923
I'm proud of you. Fucking proud.

16:16.002 --> 16:18.320
Fucking did it.
That's what I'm fucking talking about, man.

16:18.336 --> 16:19.836
I'm fucking proud of you, man.

16:19.919 --> 16:22.215
Fucking proud of you, man,
now you're a fucking man.

16:22.294 --> 16:23.885
- Right? Right?
- Right, homie.

16:24.002 --> 16:24.968
Right.

16:25.044 --> 16:26.044
All right then.

16:26.128 --> 16:28.503
No fucking fear, man.
No fucking fear.

16:28.585 --> 16:32.461
That's how we fucking do it, man.

16:34.169 --> 16:37.045
Call the motherfucking ambulance!
They got CK!

16:37.128 --> 16:38.924
Somebody call a fucking ambulance!

16:39.002 --> 16:40.152
Hold on, dawg, hold on.

16:40.211 --> 16:42.711
Bitch-ass sewer rats was from Curbside.
I seen them.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.136
Fucking <i>eses</i> are serving us.
Curbside's serving us.

16:45.211 --> 16:46.836
Curbside's banging all over us on Bloods.

16:46.919 --> 16:48.090
Peanut, you got that chopper?

16:48.585 --> 16:50.052
Let's go hit these punk-ass fools.

16:50.128 --> 16:51.278
Cut that fucking camera off!

17:03.377 --> 17:05.798
So this is what we believe
to be the Code 37 vehicle

17:05.877 --> 17:07.219
used in the drive-by last night.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.544
Curbside Gang's at it again, bro.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.545
It fits the description.
It comes back as stolen.

17:11.086 --> 17:13.757
Curbside likes these vehicles
because they blend in,

17:13.836 --> 17:15.234
you can put a lot of people in them.

17:15.252 --> 17:18.594
This door slides back,
and the gang members open fire.

17:18.669 --> 17:20.640
The victim was a male black
from a Blood set

17:20.719 --> 17:22.510
that has basically been at war
with this Hispanic gang

17:22.585 --> 17:23.824
over control of narcotic sales.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.152
- Partner.
- Yeah.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.714
- What up?
- Check this out.

17:26.961 --> 17:29.837
Oh, shit. Those are shell casings.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.087
Detectives told us
that three different weapons were used

17:32.169 --> 17:34.215
and we're seeing at least
two kinds of shells, so...

17:34.752 --> 17:35.902
Shit.

17:36.211 --> 17:37.426
What's up?

17:37.585 --> 17:39.927
Those are the Homicide detectives
working the case.

17:40.710 --> 17:42.177
- The hell's this?
- What?

17:42.253 --> 17:43.503
<i>Candid Camera?</i>

17:43.585 --> 17:45.131
No, sir, it's just a project I'm working on.

17:45.211 --> 17:46.302
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:46.377 --> 17:47.527
I don't want to see that.

17:47.585 --> 17:51.007
There are .45 and .09 millimeter
shell casings inside.

17:51.086 --> 17:52.461
How do you know that?

17:52.544 --> 17:53.840
- Did you touch them?
- No, sir.

17:53.919 --> 17:54.999
Did you fuck up my vehicle?

17:55.044 --> 17:56.044
No, sir.

17:56.128 --> 17:58.220
Sir, we found it, we called you.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.010
The big dogs are here now,

18:00.128 --> 18:02.485
so set up some yellow tape
and stay on the other side of it.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.881
Dude, it's been two hours,
we're still waiting for the detectives

18:06.961 --> 18:08.882
to release the scene
so we can go back on patrol.

18:08.961 --> 18:13.007
Comfortable footwear.
Policing is all about comfortable footwear.

18:20.169 --> 18:23.090
Officer Van Hauser. Good evening.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.840
Sarge said I should relieve you guys

18:24.919 --> 18:26.794
so you can go back to being
the street gods that you are.

18:26.877 --> 18:28.027
I'm down with that.

18:29.544 --> 18:32.545
Hey, hey! On the street.

18:33.460 --> 18:37.586
Watch the street. Make sure no assholes
come up here and kill us.

18:37.669 --> 18:39.215
Yes, sir.

18:40.377 --> 18:41.844
Fucking Christ.

18:41.919 --> 18:44.760
Officer Van Hauser,
have you made a difference today?

18:47.961 --> 18:49.280
You know, I see you guys out here,

18:49.293 --> 18:50.839
you're being good little company men,
aren't you?

18:50.919 --> 18:52.215
You're doing the Lord's work?

18:52.293 --> 18:54.385
And you're making a difference,
as you call it.

18:54.502 --> 18:55.718
It's all fun and games to you,

18:55.794 --> 18:58.294
you get to run and jump
and fight and shoot.

18:58.377 --> 19:00.548
One day, mark my words.

19:00.627 --> 19:03.548
One day the LAPD is gonna bend you over
your black and white,

19:03.627 --> 19:05.423
and they are going
to fuck you up the ass.

19:06.502 --> 19:11.503
They are going to fuck you
so long and so hard,

19:12.460 --> 19:14.460
you're gonna want to eat your gun
just to make it stop.

19:14.502 --> 19:17.094
And if you don't eat your gun

19:17.169 --> 19:19.544
and the fucking somehow magically stops,

19:21.377 --> 19:22.969
they're gonna give you freeway therapy.

19:23.044 --> 19:26.215
You're gonna end up
doing West End Valley day watch,

19:26.293 --> 19:30.011
spending two hours every day
on the fucking freeway

19:30.086 --> 19:33.087
just thinking about the fucking
that they gave you.

19:34.086 --> 19:37.007
Bad guys attack from up front.
The department comes in from the rear.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.255
Watch your six.

19:41.002 --> 19:45.423
I'm ready. This may say Purell,
but it's really K-Y.

19:47.002 --> 19:48.343
Officer Zavala.

19:48.460 --> 19:51.586
That's funny.
You kids have fun out there.

19:51.669 --> 19:53.920
The LAPD's got a big fucking cock.

19:54.002 --> 19:55.468
You got a big heart.

19:56.210 --> 19:57.927
Thank you for sharing that.

19:58.002 --> 19:59.468
Can't wait to get it up the ass.

20:06.669 --> 20:08.761
Dude, are you gonna hook up
with a Mexican girl?

20:08.836 --> 20:10.177
Quit trying to hook me up with one, dude.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.924
Dude, it'd be great if you did, but...

20:12.002 --> 20:13.673
I get it, man. Shit.

20:16.335 --> 20:17.702
Sweet brown sugar.

20:19.293 --> 20:20.418
You should marry one of my cousins.

20:20.502 --> 20:21.622
If they're anything like you,

20:21.627 --> 20:23.705
I wouldn't be able to stand
a fucking hour with them.

20:25.877 --> 20:27.252
Waking up in the morning,
they'd be like,

20:27.335 --> 20:28.551
"Hey, can I tell you a story?"

20:28.627 --> 20:29.593
I know.

20:29.669 --> 20:31.465
"Here's a story about this
and a story about that

20:31.544 --> 20:33.045
and a story about this
and a story about that..."

20:33.128 --> 20:35.387
But, dude, all you gotta do is this.
All you gotta do is this.

20:36.710 --> 20:37.881
"Yeah. Yeah."

20:38.002 --> 20:39.422
"You want to come to my cousin's <i>quinceañera?</i>

20:39.585 --> 20:42.086
"My daughter's <i>quinceañera?</i>
My brother's <i>quinceañera?"</i>

20:42.168 --> 20:43.919
- Yeah.
- "My sister's <i>quinceañera?"</i>

20:44.002 --> 20:46.128
There's always something
happening, though, bro.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.256
It's better than, like,

20:47.335 --> 20:50.086
"Do you know the new kind
of flavored coffee I have?"

20:50.210 --> 20:51.461
- "Do you like this kind of coffee?"
- Oh, really?

20:51.585 --> 20:53.437
- Shut the fuck up.
- "The baristas are excellent."

20:53.502 --> 20:55.753
You like fucking coffee, dude,
don't give me that shit.

20:55.836 --> 20:57.461
I like fucking good Starbucks coffee.

20:57.544 --> 21:00.545
Whatever. I'll let you lay into me.
Lay into me, dude. Fine.

21:02.002 --> 21:05.969
<i>13 X-ray 13.

21:06.044 --> 21:09.090
<i>Code 2 incident 5-7-5-5 and RD 13-27.</i>

21:10.168 --> 21:13.510
<i>13 X-ray 13, we're gonna be Code 6
on the missing juvenile.</i>

21:15.127 --> 21:16.924
I can't see dick.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.135
Hi.

21:21.544 --> 21:23.590
Yeah. We got a call
about some missing children.

21:23.669 --> 21:26.045
Yes. Yes, my babies are gone.

21:26.127 --> 21:27.350
- All right.
- My babies are gone.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.510
You want to let us in?
We can talk.

21:28.585 --> 21:29.801
We can have a conversation about this,
all right?

21:29.877 --> 21:31.218
Oh, okay, okay.

21:31.335 --> 21:33.335
My babies are gone.
They've been missing all night.

21:33.419 --> 21:35.419
- And I've been here.
- Why don't you step over here a second?

21:35.502 --> 21:36.718
Officer, we're wasting time.

21:36.794 --> 21:38.010
Sir, let me see your hands.

21:38.085 --> 21:39.631
How many children are missing?

21:40.109 --> 21:42.381
Two. A boy and a girl.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.586
Ma'am, what are the ages of the children
that are missing?

21:44.669 --> 21:47.670
One is one and the other'll
be three soon.

21:47.752 --> 21:49.423
- Sir!
- Somebody took them.

21:49.502 --> 21:51.594
Let me see your hands, please.
Let me see your hands.

21:51.669 --> 21:53.920
- ...quick, quick. In and out.
- Put your hands behind your head.

21:54.002 --> 21:55.468
All right. All right.

21:55.544 --> 21:56.920
Hands behind your head!

21:57.002 --> 21:58.240
I've been here all night.

21:58.252 --> 21:59.594
Officer, we're good here.

21:59.669 --> 22:00.920
Listen, don't say anything to them, man.

22:01.002 --> 22:02.217
I know, but they're not here.

22:02.293 --> 22:03.418
They're gone. The babies are gone.

22:03.502 --> 22:04.502
What did you say?

22:04.585 --> 22:05.961
I'm gonna check the house, okay?

22:06.044 --> 22:08.089
Please listen to me. I'm trying to tell you.
I've looked...

22:08.168 --> 22:09.419
The kids are with their grandma.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.298
- Is this your husband?
- That's not my husband.

22:11.377 --> 22:13.423
- Sit the fuck down!
- I've been looking.

22:13.502 --> 22:14.844
I'm gonna check the house.

22:14.919 --> 22:17.510
Sometimes children can hide
under a bed or in a closet, okay?

22:17.585 --> 22:18.927
You can talk to my partner.

22:19.002 --> 22:20.252
You're wasting time!

22:20.502 --> 22:23.844
The kids are not here!
If you can please go outside and get my kids.

22:23.919 --> 22:25.294
Talk to my partner.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.548
Stop, don't push me!
My babies are missing!

22:27.627 --> 22:29.252
Let me see some type of warrant.
You got a warrant?

22:29.335 --> 22:30.551
Officer, let me see some type of warrant.

22:30.627 --> 22:31.798
We don't need a warrant,
she let us in.

22:31.877 --> 22:33.673
Why the fuck did you say anything?

22:33.752 --> 22:35.844
Why the fuck did you say anything?

22:35.961 --> 22:37.836
- Sit down, man.
- Officer, can I get a cigarette?

22:37.919 --> 22:39.069
Not right now.

22:39.669 --> 22:41.011
I'm trying to tell you, the kids

22:41.085 --> 22:42.927
are with their grandma, man, okay?

22:43.002 --> 22:44.502
I heard you. They're with the grandma.

22:47.752 --> 22:49.127
Would you please listen to me, Officer?

22:49.210 --> 22:50.649
Let me see some type of warrant.

22:53.168 --> 22:55.385
You shut the fuck up!
Why did you let them in here?

22:55.460 --> 22:56.506
Press charges on this motherfucker!

22:56.585 --> 22:57.710
You fucking bitch,
I'm gonna kill you!

22:57.794 --> 22:59.419
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

22:59.502 --> 23:01.173
Get the fuck off me!

23:01.669 --> 23:02.819
What the fuck's happening?

23:02.877 --> 23:04.127
- Wait a minute!
- All right, all right!

23:04.210 --> 23:06.631
Did you hear what I said to you?

23:06.710 --> 23:09.067
You just let me know how clear I have
to make myself to you.

23:09.127 --> 23:10.566
Why don't you open your fucking mouth

23:10.627 --> 23:12.252
and tell me how clear I have
to make myself to you?

23:12.335 --> 23:14.586
Partner! Partner! Get off him.

23:15.669 --> 23:17.340
Brian, what's up?

23:17.585 --> 23:18.881
You okay, partner?

23:19.043 --> 23:20.259
What's happening, Brian?

23:20.335 --> 23:21.756
Fuck you, you dumb-ass smoking bitch!

23:21.836 --> 23:23.280
I'm gonna kick you in the fucking face!

23:23.335 --> 23:24.631
I found the kids.

23:24.710 --> 23:26.035
Go ahead, you fucking crackhead.

23:26.669 --> 23:27.840
Shit.

23:33.043 --> 23:34.760
It's okay, it's okay.
You're okay now.

23:34.836 --> 23:35.986
You're okay.

23:36.877 --> 23:38.877
I'm just gonna... Shit.

23:43.168 --> 23:45.919
It's okay. It's okay, sweetie.
All right.

23:46.252 --> 23:48.173
Hey, buddy, stay still.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.836
All right, you're okay now.
You're okay.

23:57.585 --> 24:00.005
Come here, come here. You okay?

24:00.252 --> 24:01.798
You gonna take care of your sister?

24:17.544 --> 24:19.340
Fucking kids.

24:51.293 --> 24:52.443
It's so funny.

24:53.584 --> 24:55.426
It's so funny to text.

24:55.502 --> 24:56.940
Who are you texting?
That same bitch?

24:57.210 --> 24:58.506
Dude, yeah. She's smart, man.

24:58.669 --> 25:00.089
She's like the first girl I can

25:00.168 --> 25:01.510
actually have a conversation with.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.301
You know she has
a Master of Sciences in Fluid Hydraulics.

25:05.168 --> 25:06.884
- Fluid Hydraulics?
- Yes.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.586
I wouldn't brag about that, dude.

25:09.836 --> 25:12.177
That she has a master's degree
in Fluid Hydraulics.

25:12.836 --> 25:14.802
I date all these girls, man.
They're smoking hot.

25:14.876 --> 25:16.436
Yeah, your little fucking badge bunnies.

25:16.502 --> 25:18.047
I get laid without a badge,
thank you very much.

25:18.127 --> 25:19.423
Because you were in the Marines.

25:19.627 --> 25:21.593
Don't ask, don't tell.

25:21.669 --> 25:23.385
There's a pattern. An MO here.

25:23.918 --> 25:25.964
First date is dinner
and a respectful kiss.

25:26.876 --> 25:29.502
Second date is dinner,
full carnal knowledge.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.507
And then third date is dinner
and uncomfortable silences

25:32.585 --> 25:34.960
when I try and discuss
anything of merit.

25:35.876 --> 25:38.423
Then it's two or three booty calls
and it's on to the next.

25:39.544 --> 25:44.136
Okay, I went to prom
and I got married a week later.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.211
And I ain't tapped anybody but Old
Faithful for, like, eight years.

25:47.502 --> 25:50.628
So I don't know what you're
tripping about, dude.

25:50.752 --> 25:52.378
Okay. Wait, look at me real quick.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.506
- Okay, ready?
- Okay.

25:54.585 --> 25:57.301
I want somebody to talk to.
Not just sleep with.

25:57.377 --> 25:59.218
Do you fucking understand what I'm saying?

26:00.669 --> 26:02.715
- Yeah.
- Jesus, dude.

26:03.377 --> 26:05.877
White people get hung up on this
fucking "soul mate" bullshit.

26:06.252 --> 26:09.594
Just hook up with a chick
that can cook and wants kids.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.010
Some bitch that's down for you,

26:11.085 --> 26:13.427
that won't fuck your friends,
and you're straight.

26:13.502 --> 26:15.922
Dude, you're the smartest motherfucker I know,

26:16.001 --> 26:18.718
you're not gonna find some chick
that's as smart as you.

26:21.252 --> 26:22.877
- Really, dude?
- Yeah, what?

26:22.960 --> 26:26.211
Really? I'm sorry that the perfect girl
wasn't dropped in front of me

26:26.293 --> 26:27.669
when I was 18 years old.

26:27.918 --> 26:29.385
Do you talk to Gabby?

26:29.460 --> 26:31.381
Do you even have discussions with the girl?

26:31.502 --> 26:34.002
Do you want me to translate that
into fucking His... Spanish?

26:34.085 --> 26:35.131
Into Hispanic?

26:35.210 --> 26:36.511
Whatever the fuck it is.

26:37.585 --> 26:39.835
Yeah, bro, what do you think, we're mutes?

26:40.043 --> 26:43.169
And we just...
Like, sign to each other?

26:43.252 --> 26:44.548
Yeah, we talk, stupid.

26:44.627 --> 26:46.753
Gabby's a trip.
You know she's a trip, bro.

26:46.835 --> 26:48.507
You should hear the shit
that comes out of her mouth.

26:48.752 --> 26:50.551
You know what?
She would be great on <i>Jeopardy!</i>

26:50.710 --> 26:52.130
She's way smarter than I am.

26:52.502 --> 26:54.843
All right, so you see what I'm talking about.
That's all I want, man.

26:54.918 --> 26:56.289
I know you want a chick like my girl,

26:56.335 --> 26:57.695
but I'll kill you if you touch her.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.836
Fuck! I'm going to kill you, dude!
Shut up, man!

27:04.377 --> 27:05.922
What's this chick's name, dude?

27:06.127 --> 27:07.805
You don't deserve to fucking know her name.

27:09.042 --> 27:10.192
Dude, fuck that!

27:12.085 --> 27:13.631
Janet. Did you run her?

27:13.876 --> 27:15.593
Yes, she's clean.

27:16.252 --> 27:18.628
She's kind of the complete package, man.
It's like...

27:21.168 --> 27:22.759
We're going out again.

27:23.252 --> 27:25.252
Saturday's my little sister's <i>quinceañera.</i>

27:25.335 --> 27:27.677
You should roll through with Janet
from another planet.

27:27.751 --> 27:30.252
Dude, this shit's gonna be
hard-core Mexican, though, bro.

27:30.669 --> 27:32.419
You know how my <i>familia</i> rolls.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.339
Hey, <i>mija.</i>

28:08.544 --> 28:10.510
- What's up?
- Come here, baby girl.

28:11.751 --> 28:13.468
Drink the Jim Jones, baby, come on.

28:16.544 --> 28:20.794
Hey, baby? Tell me something.
You ever fucked on heroin?

28:20.876 --> 28:21.922
Yeah, right.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.627
I could fuck forever on that shit.

28:25.210 --> 28:27.010
I'll eat your pussy for hours, girl.

28:27.293 --> 28:28.884
Get the fuck over here.

28:29.627 --> 28:31.672
Fuck that fool, he's crazy, he's tripping.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.676
You're my fucking lady.
I'll buy you shit.

28:36.377 --> 28:37.672
You see this shit right here?

28:38.960 --> 28:41.302
It's fucking money. Real shit.

28:41.502 --> 28:42.797
What you like?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.343
- Come here.
- Okay.

28:47.043 --> 28:51.089
<i>Any Newton unit. 5-0-7 party.

28:51.168 --> 28:53.918

28:54.210 --> 28:55.960

<i>X 9, roger.

28:59.668 --> 29:01.010
<i>X 25, roger.</i>

29:01.085 --> 29:03.006
<i>X 13, we're gonna be Code 6
on the party call.</i>

29:03.085 --> 29:04.235
<i>X 13, roger.</i>

29:21.127 --> 29:25.128
Keep your eyes wide, this place
is assholed up. Clear the car.

29:37.001 --> 29:38.468
Put that shit away.

29:40.335 --> 29:41.676
Put that down, bro.

29:48.001 --> 29:49.876
What's the occasion?

29:55.793 --> 29:58.010
Can you turn down the music?

30:05.085 --> 30:08.507
Have some respect, La La.
Don't light up in front of us.

30:08.835 --> 30:11.131
Why don't you take a hit, <i>mija?</i>
It'll chill you out.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.926
It'll be like back in the days.
Remember?

30:14.001 --> 30:16.297
I don't remember shit.
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:16.377 --> 30:18.048
I said put it out.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.177
You know you want this, pig.

30:21.793 --> 30:24.964
I wouldn't fucking touch that
if you were the last bitch on Earth.

30:25.377 --> 30:26.843
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

30:26.918 --> 30:28.089
Why don't you take a seat?

30:28.168 --> 30:29.668
- You look in the mirror...
- Lock it up, Orozco.

30:29.751 --> 30:31.423
You're just a common gangster bitch
like all the rest.

30:31.502 --> 30:32.752
Why don't you sit your ass down?

30:32.835 --> 30:34.461
Why don't you do
what they tell you, puppet?

30:34.584 --> 30:36.543
- Want me to make you?
- Lock it up, partner.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.378
You know what?

30:40.335 --> 30:42.006
I'll fucking sit down now.

30:42.085 --> 30:43.756
Thank you. Thank you very much.

30:54.460 --> 30:56.335
So, Mr. Big Evil,

30:57.168 --> 30:59.168
why do they call you Big Evil?

31:00.543 --> 31:01.964
Because,

31:03.043 --> 31:05.464
my evil is big.

31:23.668 --> 31:27.169
Can you turn down the music?
We got a noise complaint or some shit.

31:57.252 --> 31:58.843
Then you go faster.

32:03.293 --> 32:06.169
I am nailing this. Oh, my...

32:16.751 --> 32:18.002
Come on, baby.

32:23.335 --> 32:24.710
- Hey, bro.
- Hey.

32:25.876 --> 32:27.467
- Hi, baby.
- Cindy, what's up?

32:27.543 --> 32:28.919
I wanted to introduce you to Janet.

32:29.001 --> 32:31.252
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
Happy birthday.

32:31.335 --> 32:32.381
Thank you.

32:32.459 --> 32:33.609
You look beautiful.

32:33.918 --> 32:35.474
Pick up your dress
so you don't step on it.

32:35.501 --> 32:37.377
- You look beautiful.
- I gotta go. Bye!

32:37.459 --> 32:39.335
- All grown up.
- He spoils her.

32:39.419 --> 32:40.794
But I want to give you the lowdown.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.343
I'm listening. I'm listening.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.589
So, everybody here is pretty much family.
Like somehow.

32:44.668 --> 32:45.940
They're all Mexican family.

32:46.918 --> 32:48.260
You got cousins and you
got aunts and uncles,

32:48.335 --> 32:50.176
just like everything else,
and then you got cousins' cousins.

32:50.252 --> 32:51.703
And then you have Brian.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.787
You stick around,
you're gonna see somebody throw up.

32:54.835 --> 32:56.961
Couple fights. It's fun. It's fun.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.169
Enough, enough. I'm sorry.

32:59.335 --> 33:01.256
Well, I'm Irish, so it's the same thing.

33:01.335 --> 33:03.881
Big families, and nobody ever gets divorced.

33:04.001 --> 33:05.421
- And they all wear purple.
- Well, less purple,

33:05.501 --> 33:08.301
- but just as much beer.
- She's funny.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.593
They get way too drunk
and get in fistfights.

33:10.668 --> 33:11.634
Yeah, same here.

33:11.709 --> 33:13.801
But you mess with one person,
you have the whole family after you.

33:13.876 --> 33:15.092
That's the way to do it.

33:15.168 --> 33:17.057
- There you go.
- You just described Mexican people.

33:17.293 --> 33:18.543
Can I feel it? Is that okay?

33:18.626 --> 33:20.441
Yeah, he's actually kicking a lot
right now. Here.

33:20.584 --> 33:22.023
And I think his feet are right there.

33:23.626 --> 33:24.893
Do you feel it?

33:25.918 --> 33:27.294
Oh, my God.

33:27.376 --> 33:28.843
I like her, Brian.

33:29.210 --> 33:31.006
- Buddy.
- How long have you known Brian?

33:31.085 --> 33:34.006
Three years. He and Mike
went to the Academy together, so...

33:34.085 --> 33:35.505
Right.

34:25.751 --> 34:27.297
Brian, it's you.

34:41.293 --> 34:42.759
Hi.

34:45.418 --> 34:47.418
I'm gonna try not to wake you up.

34:52.543 --> 34:54.839
I can't believe that I stayed over.

34:57.668 --> 35:02.419
This, this is interesting.
I have never shot one before.

35:04.292 --> 35:06.759
Maybe that could be our next date.

35:10.001 --> 35:13.093
I did go through your wallet.
I'm sorry.

35:13.168 --> 35:15.293
I am naturally curious.

35:15.376 --> 35:17.252
I hope that's okay.

35:18.376 --> 35:22.969
Gotta love a guy who has
a picture of his mom in his wallet.

35:26.292 --> 35:29.259
This? Yeah.

35:29.334 --> 35:33.052
Kristin, Mia, Raquel, etcetera, etcetera...

35:33.668 --> 35:35.543
You won't be needing this any more.

35:44.709 --> 35:45.960
You were drooling.

36:02.584 --> 36:04.063
What are we looking for again?

36:04.584 --> 36:06.710
All the food groups, dope,
money and guns.

36:06.793 --> 36:08.839
The ghetto will provide, bro.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.839
Fucking Sarge. Sarge!

36:18.251 --> 36:20.843
We're staking out Curbside.
They're gonna spot your unit.

36:20.918 --> 36:23.589
What, you think they don't know
you're here?

36:23.668 --> 36:25.706
Van Hauser wants to file
a complaint on you, Taylor.

36:25.876 --> 36:27.968
Oh, the <i>USS Van Hauser?</i>

36:28.043 --> 36:29.463
The LAPD's stealthiest submarine,

36:29.543 --> 36:30.919
only surfaces at the end of watch?

36:31.127 --> 36:32.923
He said you were videotaping him.

36:33.001 --> 36:35.127
What did I tell you about that shit?

36:35.334 --> 36:36.755
Why is he such a bitter dude?

36:36.835 --> 36:38.380
If he hates pushing
the black and white so much,

36:38.459 --> 36:40.710
why doesn't he just leave his badge
on the watch commander's desk

36:40.793 --> 36:42.464
and go home and eat a bowl of dicks?

36:42.543 --> 36:44.259
Have some empathy for this man.

36:45.168 --> 36:46.509
Taylor, I gotta put in my log

36:46.584 --> 36:48.676
that I verbally counseled you
about this fucking camera.

36:48.751 --> 36:50.968
What? I was documenting a crime scene.

36:51.127 --> 36:52.297
Have a good day, ladies.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.093
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.

37:10.292 --> 37:12.170
God, is that Big Evil's mom right there?

37:12.251 --> 37:14.172
His mom? Yeah, that's Mrs. Evil.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.651
Who's the cowboy?

37:17.127 --> 37:20.252
I don't know.
He's got money, look at his truck.

37:21.001 --> 37:22.001
I'm gonna run him.

37:22.085 --> 37:23.124
You want to jam this fool?

37:23.167 --> 37:24.418
Yes, I do.

37:27.251 --> 37:29.502
Plate's clean. Shit.

37:30.459 --> 37:31.880
What's our PC, though?

37:31.960 --> 37:34.255
That stupid CD hanging
from his rearview mirror,

37:34.334 --> 37:35.484
obstructing his vision.

37:36.459 --> 37:37.926
- Let's do this.
- All right.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.922
Come on, fucker.

37:51.209 --> 37:52.630
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:54.709 --> 37:56.129
Light them up.

37:56.209 --> 37:57.505
13 X-ray 13, we're Code 6

37:58.126 --> 38:00.752
on three 9 street, east of Wall.

38:01.209 --> 38:03.676
License plate 4-Boy-1-7-3-2.

38:03.835 --> 38:05.130
Gray Dodge pickup.

38:05.209 --> 38:06.835
<i>13 X 13, roger, Code 6...</i>

38:06.918 --> 38:08.714
Let's get this fucker.

38:25.084 --> 38:26.300
Gun!

38:28.543 --> 38:29.942
Get the fuck out of the car.

38:31.626 --> 38:33.592
Get the fuck out the car!

38:35.334 --> 38:36.755
You good, partner?

38:36.835 --> 38:37.985
I'm good.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.506
<i>X 25 shows Code 6 with X 13.</i>

38:42.043 --> 38:43.884
<i>13 x 2-5, roger.</i>

38:46.209 --> 38:47.835
You okay?

38:50.876 --> 38:52.251
13 X-ray 13 show...

38:52.334 --> 38:53.505
Transport this son of a bitch.

38:53.584 --> 38:54.734
Yeah, no problem.

39:01.251 --> 39:02.808
Check out this motherfucker's burner, bro.

39:02.876 --> 39:04.376
Holy shit.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.193
Dude, he's got more bling
than the old lady's wedding ring.

39:11.334 --> 39:12.484
A cell.

39:13.001 --> 39:15.046
- You don't have any holes in you?
- I'm good, bro.

39:15.126 --> 39:17.002
Let's toss the truck.

39:17.876 --> 39:19.626
Hey, who was he shooting at?

39:19.709 --> 39:21.334
- What?
- Who was he shooting at?

39:21.418 --> 39:22.568
Me.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.002
That's fucked up, man.

39:27.835 --> 39:30.460
<i>Air 11, show us responding.</i>

39:37.209 --> 39:38.505
Fucking...

39:39.751 --> 39:41.467
Soup.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.184
What's up?

39:49.668 --> 39:52.635
Yo, that's big money right there, bro. Shit.

39:58.167 --> 39:59.759
Oh, shit.

40:03.459 --> 40:05.084
What the fuck is it?

40:05.543 --> 40:07.134
Homeboy's a player, dude.

40:08.042 --> 40:09.192
We got a surprise for you.

40:10.501 --> 40:12.046
Liberace's AK.

40:13.501 --> 40:14.651
What?

40:20.501 --> 40:22.467
Holy shit.

40:23.709 --> 40:28.084
Here we have two of the major food groups,
money and guns.

40:28.167 --> 40:32.213
This is the lifeblood of our organization.
Paperwork.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.842
The way red corpuscles carry oxygen
through the body,

40:36.876 --> 40:39.092
paperwork carries information
through the department.

40:40.042 --> 40:41.088
What are corpuscles?

40:41.167 --> 40:42.634
Evening, guys.

40:42.751 --> 40:44.797
- Evening. How you doing, Captain?
- Sir.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.987
So this is it?
These are the guns you took off the cowboy?

40:47.042 --> 40:48.088
- Yup.
- Yes, sir.

40:48.167 --> 40:49.918
Mind if I pick them up?

40:51.709 --> 40:52.755
Fancy.

40:52.835 --> 40:53.985
That's some nice hardware.

40:54.418 --> 40:56.134
Yeah, I heard he took a shot at you.
You okay?

40:56.209 --> 40:58.084
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.
- He's good.

40:58.167 --> 40:59.509
Liberace's AK.

40:59.584 --> 41:01.334
This looks like Liberace's AK.

41:02.876 --> 41:05.592
Keep up the good work, guys.
I really appreciate it. Carry on.

41:05.668 --> 41:06.963
- Thank you.
- Good evening, sir.

41:07.042 --> 41:08.133
Good night, Van Hauser.

41:08.209 --> 41:09.380
Evening, sir.

41:10.501 --> 41:11.752
Why do you get nervous?

41:11.835 --> 41:13.761
Women want him, men want to be him, man.
He's just...

41:13.835 --> 41:15.301
Yeah, I know. But you want him.

41:15.376 --> 41:17.502
Dude, I'm not gay,
but I'd go down on him if he asked.

41:19.543 --> 41:21.669
Sometimes I don't know when you're kidding.

41:21.959 --> 41:23.478
And I have to know when you're kidding.

41:23.959 --> 41:25.676
- I'm not kidding.
- I gotta know when you're kidding.

41:25.751 --> 41:27.376
I'm not kidding.

41:32.975 --> 41:34.171
Dude. I gotta go.

41:34.584 --> 41:36.129
I'm taking Janet to the Philharmonic.

41:37.209 --> 41:38.585
Enjoy your white people shit.

41:38.668 --> 41:40.306
Oh, thanks, I'll bring you back a <i>burrito.</i>

41:40.334 --> 41:41.676
No problem.

42:11.084 --> 42:12.801
You're the best.

42:17.626 --> 42:19.501
One more time.

42:23.668 --> 42:26.838
Dude! Stop. Stop, man, fuck.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.546
What are you gonna say to the taxpayers

42:35.626 --> 42:38.092
when you crash the fucking car?

42:39.000 --> 42:42.501
Drink more coffee.

42:42.917 --> 42:45.794
Dude, I'm on my ninth fucking Red Bull.

42:46.992 --> 42:48.088
We got a fire.

42:48.167 --> 42:49.317
- Where?
- Over there.

42:50.209 --> 42:52.676
13 X-ray 13, we're Code 6
on a structure fire.

42:52.751 --> 42:54.672
- What's that address?
- 1-0-0-2.

42:54.875 --> 42:59.126
1002 Sixth Street.
Go ahead and send RA and fire.

42:59.209 --> 43:01.800
<i>13 X 13, roger on the RA.</i>

43:06.251 --> 43:09.127
My babies! My babies are in there!

43:09.209 --> 43:10.255
Where? Where?

43:10.334 --> 43:11.459
They're upstairs in the bedroom.

43:11.543 --> 43:12.759
All right, ma'am.

43:12.834 --> 43:17.006
Z, no! Yo, yo, yo, Z!
Z, wait for fire, bro! Fuck!

43:21.334 --> 43:23.380
- Over there, kids' room.
- Shit.

43:26.209 --> 43:28.834
Dude, the kids' room, come on!
Come here.

43:35.792 --> 43:37.134
Hey, come here, come here.

43:38.418 --> 43:40.134
- Go with him!
- Come on! Come here!

43:40.209 --> 43:42.084
Come here. Wrap your arms around me.

43:42.167 --> 43:44.042
There you go. Wrap your legs around me.
You got it.

43:44.126 --> 43:45.842
There you go. I'm going down, Z!

43:45.917 --> 43:48.918
Come on, come on, come on. Come on.
Wrap your legs, then go. Yup.

43:50.042 --> 43:51.792
- Z, you all right?
- I'm good. I'm good.

43:52.418 --> 43:54.339
Come on. Go, go, go, man!

43:54.459 --> 43:56.334
I'm going, man. Fuck!

43:56.834 --> 43:58.755
Come on, put your head right here.

44:00.834 --> 44:02.130
Come on.

44:02.501 --> 44:04.217
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come down!

44:04.668 --> 44:05.818
Come on, man!

44:09.292 --> 44:11.588
Where's my baby girl?
Where is she?

44:11.668 --> 44:14.589
Wait, wait, wait, lady,
you got more kids?

44:14.668 --> 44:16.793
My girl. She's two.

44:16.875 --> 44:18.467
Oh, shit.

44:18.543 --> 44:21.714
No, Z, Z, no! Come on!

44:22.084 --> 44:23.585
Go, go, go, get up!

44:23.668 --> 44:24.714
Fuck, it's hot.

44:24.792 --> 44:26.464
God damn it!

44:38.251 --> 44:39.842
Come here, babe.
Come here. Come here.

44:42.501 --> 44:44.501
Cover her face.
Put that blanket around her face.

44:44.584 --> 44:45.834
I got her.

44:48.167 --> 44:50.293
I got her. I can't breathe, bro.

44:52.292 --> 44:53.634
Come on, go, go, go.

44:53.750 --> 44:56.046
I can't see. Where you at?

44:56.251 --> 44:57.717
- I'm right here.
- Follow the light.

44:58.708 --> 44:59.754
I can't see you.

44:59.834 --> 45:00.984
I'm right here.

45:04.834 --> 45:05.834
Come on.

45:05.917 --> 45:07.008

45:07.084 --> 45:08.709
I got her. Shit.

45:09.351 --> 45:10.501
I'm going down.

45:11.334 --> 45:13.050
- Come on.
- All right.

45:24.042 --> 45:25.838
Stay still. Stay still.

45:27.084 --> 45:29.301
Come on, come on, come on.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.150
I'm right here, dude!

45:53.376 --> 45:55.006
I'm gonna check you out,
sit down right here.

45:55.084 --> 45:57.301
Check you guys out.
Can you open your eyes?

45:57.959 --> 45:59.834
You all right, bro?
Give me a bottle of water.

45:59.917 --> 46:01.418
Z! Z!

46:04.000 --> 46:05.625

Get away, get away, bro.

- Fuck, man.

46:10.667 --> 46:11.918
Get away, dude.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.421

Don't fucking freak out, dude.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.376
Shut up, shut up!

46:58.042 --> 46:59.192
Hi, Brian.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.716
You feel like a hero?

47:06.792 --> 47:08.293
What?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.046
You feel like a hero?

47:12.501 --> 47:14.001
No.

47:15.376 --> 47:17.468
Yeah, me neither.

47:19.917 --> 47:22.043
What's a hero feel like?

47:25.209 --> 47:26.880
I don't know, man.

47:29.875 --> 47:32.251
Did I tell you that me and Gabby

47:32.334 --> 47:34.629
got into a huge fight over the fire?

47:34.708 --> 47:37.004
Nope, you didn't tell me that.

47:38.501 --> 47:40.001
She was...

47:41.126 --> 47:44.002
She's like, "You could have died
for someone else's kid

47:44.084 --> 47:46.630
when ours hasn't even been born yet."

47:46.708 --> 47:49.084
She's like, "You're not a fireman."

47:49.167 --> 47:50.418
Janet said the same thing.

47:50.501 --> 47:51.751
Yeah?

47:54.000 --> 47:56.126
I don't think I could go
in another burning building.

47:56.209 --> 48:00.960
I only went in because you did.
Just put that shit out there.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.251
All right, dickhead, what is it?

48:19.084 --> 48:22.426
You remember that cowboy
with the blinged-out AK?

48:22.500 --> 48:23.796
Yeah, he's probably my cousin.

48:23.875 --> 48:25.421
All right, I crisscrossed
some numbers on his cell.

48:25.500 --> 48:27.342
Couple addresses come up
in our basic area.

48:27.418 --> 48:28.418
You're not a detective.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.217
That guy is something.
He's into something.

48:30.292 --> 48:31.917
Oh, really? You think?

48:32.000 --> 48:35.251
Dude, DA didn't buy the ADW,
only filed on the weapons beef.

48:35.334 --> 48:36.504
Gang Unit says they'll get to him,

48:36.583 --> 48:37.754
but they're too busy or some shit.

48:37.834 --> 48:40.710
And Narco's not interested
because we didn't find dope.

48:40.792 --> 48:42.213
Yeah, but you're not a detective.

48:42.292 --> 48:44.042
- You're not a fireman.
- Fuck you.

48:44.583 --> 48:46.334
Follow me into the house, dude.

48:47.334 --> 48:48.532
I said you're not a detective.

48:48.583 --> 48:49.733
I want to be a detective.

48:49.792 --> 48:51.667
- You wanna be?
- Follow me into the house, dude.

48:51.875 --> 48:53.921
Follow me into the house.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.421
Follow me into the house, dude.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.842
13 X-ray 13 with a Code 6
at 9-3-1-8, 5-3 street.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.876
<i>13 X 13, roger.</i>

49:30.292 --> 49:33.042
The fuck? What the fuck?

49:35.334 --> 49:36.879
This is weird.

49:47.209 --> 49:50.210
13 X-ray 13,
you need to send us additional unit.

49:50.417 --> 49:53.043
<i>13 X 13 is requesting
two additional units</i>

49:53.126 --> 49:55.717
<i>for a building search
at 1-0-0, 2-6 street.</i>

50:08.500 --> 50:10.342
It's okay, it's okay.

50:11.499 --> 50:13.001
It's okay. Goodbye.

50:14.583 --> 50:15.862
Fuck this guy.

50:18.251 --> 50:20.251
Get that shit out of here.

50:26.167 --> 50:27.587
I know what that means.

50:29.084 --> 50:30.504
Shut the fuck up, man.

50:31.542 --> 50:32.692
Spread your legs.

50:34.625 --> 50:36.375
Spread your fucking legs.

50:38.875 --> 50:40.341
Put your fucking head back.

50:42.251 --> 50:44.047
- Gun, partner.
- Oh, yeah?

50:50.458 --> 50:52.050
Get your fucking head back.

50:56.417 --> 50:58.257
- Another gun, partner.
- Two, huh?

51:03.209 --> 51:05.050
Wads of cash.

51:05.126 --> 51:06.717
All right, tell him to get on his knees.

51:10.167 --> 51:11.883
Get the fuck over here.

51:15.375 --> 51:17.217
13 X-ray 13.
We've got one in custody.

51:17.292 --> 51:18.712
<i>13 X 13, roger.</i>

51:18.875 --> 51:21.671
All right, we're good. All right.

51:30.667 --> 51:31.838
What do we got?

51:33.625 --> 51:35.092
Check it out, partner.

51:35.834 --> 51:37.086
I got this motherfucker.

51:45.834 --> 51:48.005
Oh, my God.

52:12.750 --> 52:13.841
Take my buddy.

52:13.917 --> 52:15.588
What the fuck, Zavala?
You catch 'em, I clean 'em?

52:15.667 --> 52:16.817
Take him.

52:18.291 --> 52:20.088
I don't know, we got like...

52:20.917 --> 52:22.395
- I'm gonna go outside.
- Yo, Z, you good?

52:22.458 --> 52:23.608
- I'm good, bro.
- Z?

52:23.667 --> 52:25.168
I'm good!

52:31.000 --> 52:32.150
What the fuck?

52:33.583 --> 52:36.834
Federal agents. Who's in charge here?
Are you in charge?

52:36.959 --> 52:38.959
- What the fuck?
- I need to know who's in charge here.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.295
Is this man under arrest?

52:40.375 --> 52:41.421
Yes, sir.

52:41.500 --> 52:42.908
What are the charges against this man?

52:42.959 --> 52:44.709
- Turn that fucking camera off.
- It's off. It's off.

52:44.792 --> 52:45.951
The fucking camera's off, man.

52:45.959 --> 52:47.109
You guys fucked up.

52:47.333 --> 52:49.584
Just lost a POI because of you guys.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.588
- Are we clear in there?
- Clear.

52:52.750 --> 52:53.966
What the fuck, bro?

52:54.042 --> 52:56.088
- What did we fuck up?
- I don't fucking know, dude.

52:56.167 --> 52:57.257
Who the fuck is this guy?

52:57.333 --> 52:58.483
I don't fucking know.

53:22.708 --> 53:24.504
We have one POI.

53:25.042 --> 53:26.383
Dude, I just want to fucking talk
to this guy.

53:26.458 --> 53:27.538
Let's just get out of here.

53:27.542 --> 53:29.963
I just want to fucking talk to him
just for a second.

53:30.042 --> 53:31.917
- Come on, let's go.
- Go ahead.

53:33.291 --> 53:35.417
Sir, I don't want to cause
any trouble here,

53:35.500 --> 53:37.178
but we just fucking...
We rolled up here...

53:37.250 --> 53:38.409
I don't know what's going on.

53:38.458 --> 53:40.737
It's the second cowboy like this
we've run into in a week.

53:40.792 --> 53:44.918
Watch out for these guys.
They operate by a different set of rules.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.250
I know I'm just a ghetto street cop,

53:46.333 --> 53:47.504
but you gotta give me something here.

53:47.583 --> 53:50.584
We've got indicators he's a runner
for the Sinaloa cartel.

53:50.667 --> 53:52.371
Yeah, well, we ran him,
he came up clean, dude.

53:52.417 --> 53:54.838
You guys don't have the proper clearance
for any of this information,

53:54.917 --> 53:56.792
but I'm gonna throw you a bone.

53:56.875 --> 54:00.421
Cartels are operating here.
We're on it. Be careful.

54:00.500 --> 54:01.716
What does that mean, though?

54:01.875 --> 54:04.967
It means you and your homeboy
need to power down.

54:05.042 --> 54:07.042
You just tugged on the tail of the snake

54:07.126 --> 54:08.797
and it's gonna turn around
and bite you back.

54:08.875 --> 54:10.126
I'm throwing you a bone here.

54:10.208 --> 54:12.800
Be grateful for what I'm giving you.
I'm giving you a warning.

54:12.875 --> 54:13.875
Lay low.

54:13.959 --> 54:14.959
All right, yeah.

54:15.042 --> 54:16.132
Can I get your name for my log?

54:16.208 --> 54:17.584
Negative, move along.

54:18.834 --> 54:19.984
Yeah, all right.

54:21.667 --> 54:23.884
Sir, you know that
there's five-year-old kids in there?

54:24.000 --> 54:25.466
- All right, dude. Z.
- For six months?

54:25.583 --> 54:28.254
Goodbye. Get off the crime scene.
Go home.

54:28.333 --> 54:30.375
- Bye. Yeah.
- Have a nice night.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.218
- Fucking feds.
- Z, what the fuck, man?

54:32.291 --> 54:33.837
Fuck them.

54:47.500 --> 54:49.921
I didn't think that shit
came over here, bro.

54:50.792 --> 54:54.043
Kids, women. Did you see that fucking toilet?
Filled up with shit.

54:56.291 --> 54:57.963
Dude, we had no fucking business being there.

54:58.042 --> 54:59.132
We didn't even have a call there.

54:59.208 --> 55:01.129
Dude, I didn't know what we were
fucking rolling up on.

55:01.208 --> 55:02.927
You think I knew
what we were rolling up on?

55:11.333 --> 55:12.925
Human trafficking.

55:41.708 --> 55:44.709
He's so cute.
You did so good, baby.

55:46.166 --> 55:47.367
I love this smell.

55:49.166 --> 55:50.587
Just hold his head a little bit.

55:50.667 --> 55:52.009
I am. He's fine.

55:52.083 --> 55:56.425
You gotta hold him like this,
like a football.

55:56.500 --> 55:58.375
I know how to hold a baby.

56:03.041 --> 56:04.542
- Babe, please.
- Like that.

56:04.834 --> 56:06.425
- Hey.
- Hi.

56:06.900 --> 56:08.341
Hey, partner, what's up?

56:09.208 --> 56:10.434
Come here, dude.

56:14.500 --> 56:15.967
Look who's here.

56:16.041 --> 56:17.417
How's Mama doing?

56:17.500 --> 56:20.797
Mama's tired and cranky.
Just like baby.

56:21.166 --> 56:22.587
Mama wants to choke Daddy.

56:22.667 --> 56:23.838
Oh, come on, babe.

56:23.959 --> 56:25.357
Did you name him Brian?

56:25.667 --> 56:27.417
Sorry, bro.

56:27.834 --> 56:30.254
He's a junior.
I named him after his daddy.

56:30.333 --> 56:32.254
So what's his name?

56:34.250 --> 56:36.000
Fuck you, dude.

56:36.583 --> 56:38.003
Can I hold him?

56:38.708 --> 56:39.924
Yeah.

56:49.917 --> 56:51.508
So sweet.

56:52.417 --> 56:54.009
You're so done, bro.

57:07.917 --> 57:11.383
Hey, baby. What are you wearing?

57:12.999 --> 57:14.625
I can say it. What are you wearing?

57:16.625 --> 57:18.216
I don't care. You still look good.

57:19.542 --> 57:21.338
Yeah, Brian's right here.

57:21.958 --> 57:25.835
Okay. All right, sorry.
Okay, I love you. Bye.

57:26.917 --> 57:28.462
You didn't even say hi, man.

57:28.542 --> 57:30.542
She was pissed, dude.

57:33.333 --> 57:35.049
How'd you know you were
gonna marry Gabby?

57:35.125 --> 57:36.922
She told me. I was just some stoner

57:36.999 --> 57:38.466
working at my uncle's muffler shop,

57:38.542 --> 57:40.759
and one day she grabbed me
by the shoulders and says,

57:40.834 --> 57:42.925
"We're getting married
and you're joining the department,

57:42.999 --> 57:44.920
because you can make a lot of money
without a college degree."

57:44.999 --> 57:46.625
And I was like, "Fuck, yeah."

57:46.708 --> 57:50.334
I mean, you love her.
You guys, like, you never fight.

57:50.750 --> 57:51.920
You're happy together.

57:51.999 --> 57:53.671
She's my bitch for sure, dude.

57:54.333 --> 57:56.333
I'm just telling you
the way it went down.

57:56.875 --> 57:58.546
I popped her cherry in high school.

57:58.667 --> 58:00.383
She's never been with anybody else.

58:00.458 --> 58:02.129
I've never wanted to be
with anybody else.

58:02.750 --> 58:04.750
You know, it's easy.

58:04.834 --> 58:07.175
Things are getting super serious
with Janet and me.

58:07.250 --> 58:08.840
What, you just found that out?

58:08.841 --> 58:10.675
Did you read that in the paper or something?

58:10.792 --> 58:12.667
Homegirl owns your ass, dude.

58:12.750 --> 58:13.920
Dude, she wants to move in.

58:14.875 --> 58:17.625
She's always over, you know.
Why spend the money on two apartments?

58:17.708 --> 58:19.424
It's not about the money.

58:19.500 --> 58:22.000
No, her parents are so traditional, dude.

58:22.333 --> 58:24.333
- Oh, yeah?
- They will go ballistic.

58:24.875 --> 58:26.838
But at least we can tell them
we're engaged, you know.

58:27.873 --> 58:30.171
Hold up, bro.
Don't play with that shit.

58:30.542 --> 58:32.133
You don't ask a broad to marry you

58:32.208 --> 58:33.800
because her folks are old-school.

58:33.874 --> 58:35.375
No, dude, you don't understand, man.

58:35.458 --> 58:36.878
No, dude, you don't do that shit.

58:37.375 --> 58:38.842
Think about it, man.

58:39.250 --> 58:42.876
Dude, after you think about it,
think about it again. Jesus.

58:43.458 --> 58:45.800
Marriage is forever.
Just realize that.

58:46.792 --> 58:48.292
It's a promise before God.

58:50.916 --> 58:54.793
My grandma was really deep, dude.

58:55.792 --> 58:58.668
She's seen it all.
You know what I'm saying?

58:59.458 --> 59:01.924
When me and Gabby got engaged, bro,
she asked me one thing.

59:01.999 --> 59:03.170
Do you want to hear it?

59:03.250 --> 59:04.501
Fine, let's hear it.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.958
She said, "Can you live without her?"

59:10.333 --> 59:13.959
"And if the answer is yes,
man up and forget her."

59:14.041 --> 59:15.542
"Don't string her along."

59:16.625 --> 59:17.775
Think about it, bro.

59:19.208 --> 59:20.879
I did.

59:31.291 --> 59:33.508
<i>13 X-ray 43. Officer needs help.</i>

59:33.583 --> 59:34.583
Where?

59:34.667 --> 59:36.945
<i>Newton units, stand by.
X 43 officer needs help.</i>

59:36.999 --> 59:38.796
<i>13 X 43, what's your location?</i>

59:38.874 --> 59:40.341
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- What?

59:40.417 --> 59:42.417
- That's Van Hauser's car.
- Come on, Boot!

59:42.500 --> 59:43.920
Just book it south. Go, go, go.

59:45.125 --> 59:46.751
Find a street sign, put it out.

59:46.833 --> 59:48.335
<i>I don't see any!</i>

59:49.791 --> 59:51.962
Is there a number on a house?
A building number?

59:52.041 --> 59:54.713
<i>The house is 3-1-7-7.
Sir, back up!</i>

59:56.166 --> 59:58.337
Holy shit. Bro, hook a left on Maple.

59:59.417 --> 01:00:02.167
13 X-ray 13, show us responding Code 3
from 3-0 and Maple.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.501
<i>13 X 13, roger.
Responding Code 3 Maple and 3-0.</i>

01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:09.045
Right there! Right there!
Bro, right there! Go.

01:00:09.125 --> 01:00:13.092
13 X-ray 13, show us Code 6
at Compton and 3-1 street.

01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:15.132
- Who is that?
- Taylor and Zavala.

01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:17.791
13 X-ray 13, send me an airship
to set up a perimeter.

01:00:17.874 --> 01:00:18.920
Oh, shit.

01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:20.250
Taylor, would you call for a rescue?

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:22.379
Do not move. What did he look like?
Where'd he go?

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.920
Northbound through the houses.

01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:28.258
Hispanic male, blue checkered shirt.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.458
Zero-head, he's a parolee,
he's fucking huge.

01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:32.338
13 X-ray 13, suspect headed northbound,

01:00:32.417 --> 01:00:34.167
heavyset male Hispanic, shaved head.

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.000
Weapon used was a knife. KMA.

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:38.087
Let's do this shit.

01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:40.837
Careful, men. On your left.
He's fucking huge.

01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:44.464
- It's clear over here.
- Crossing.

01:00:44.749 --> 01:00:45.920
- The windows?
- You got left?

01:00:45.999 --> 01:00:47.149
I got right.

01:00:47.417 --> 01:00:49.258
Push, push, push.

01:00:49.874 --> 01:00:53.000
You're on my elbow. You call it out.
You call it out if you see it.

01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:57.424
Dude, I see him. On the left. On the left.
Ready, go, go, split.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.000
Take it, you bitch. Fuck you!

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:00.334
On the left.
I've got him, you ready?

01:01:00.417 --> 01:01:03.133
Fucking bitch. Fucking whore.
Try to fuck with me? Fuck you!

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:05.487
Get the fuck off her
or I will blow your fucking head off!

01:01:05.542 --> 01:01:07.042
I'm done. I ain't resisting, Officer.

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.275
Don't fucking look at me!

01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:10.083
- I ain't resisting, sir.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:13.133
Get up! Put your hands over your head!
Get up.

01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:15.421
Put your hands over your head.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.671
Back up towards me
till I tell you to stop.

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:20.546
Move. Move. Move.

01:01:20.667 --> 01:01:24.133
Move. Stop!
Get on your fucking knees.

01:01:24.208 --> 01:01:26.300
And cross your goddamn feet together,
you hear me?

01:01:26.375 --> 01:01:28.000
Cross your legs.

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.250
If I hear a fucking word out of you,

01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:31.129
I will blow you out
of your fucking socks.

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:32.550
Hook him, Z.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:42.171
13 X-ray 13, show a Code 4.
Suspect's in custody.

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:44.250
- You good, Z?
- I'm good. Are you good?

01:01:46.208 --> 01:01:47.504
God damn it.

01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:49.300
All right, you're gonna be all right.

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:50.966
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.633
Fuck, man, her face
is all fucking broken in.

01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:55.917
13 X-ray 13 requesting an additional RA.

01:01:55.999 --> 01:01:57.874
- <i>13 X 13, roger on the RA.</i>
- You're gonna be okay.

01:01:57.958 --> 01:01:59.674
You're gonna be all right.
We're here for you, all right?

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.309
Dude, we got the cavalry coming.

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:03.651
That motherfucker's gonna pay
for what he did, you hear me?

01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:05.508
Boot, you hear me? Boot?

01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:06.629
Don't call her Boot, bro.

01:02:06.707 --> 01:02:08.301
Well, I don't know
what her fucking name is!

01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:09.716
Is there a tag anywhere?
Do you see a tag?

01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:10.941
No.

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:14.083
You hearing me? She's nodding, dude,
she's nodding, she hears me.

01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:16.337
You're gonna be okay, all right?
Do you hear me?

01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:19.258
It's all good. It's all good.

01:02:24.791 --> 01:02:26.087
You're gonna be okay, brother.

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:28.916
Fucking cut my vest off.
God damn it, Taylor.

01:02:28.999 --> 01:02:33.091
I tell you one fucking thing!
Fucking cut my vest off!

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:34.417
All right, bro, we got your back.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.670
Jesus Christ! God damn it.

01:02:36.749 --> 01:02:39.875
Get back, brother, all right.
You're good, bro. We got your back.

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:42.754
They cut my fucking vest.
They cut my fucking vest.

01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:45.504
What's up? You okay?

01:02:45.916 --> 01:02:48.008
Taylor, I'm really tired, dude.

01:02:48.417 --> 01:02:51.963
Why didn't you shoot that son of a bitch?
You had him dead to rights.

01:02:52.666 --> 01:02:54.630
I just didn't feel like
killing anyone tonight, Sarge.

01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:56.105
You feel like writing this up?

01:02:56.583 --> 01:02:58.878
Brass is gonna want clean paper,
make sure all the logs match.

01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:00.254
Sarge, did you see that?

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:02.924
Van H had a fucking <i>Ginsu</i>
sticking out of his eye.

01:03:02.999 --> 01:03:04.420
His eye was cut in half.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.715
The lens was hanging out.

01:03:05.999 --> 01:03:07.341
He's not coming back.

01:03:07.874 --> 01:03:08.965
Rookie, too.

01:03:09.041 --> 01:03:10.462
- She ain't coming back.
- What?

01:03:10.542 --> 01:03:12.283
She gave me this to give
to the watch commander.

01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:13.483
On the spot?

01:03:13.542 --> 01:03:14.692
Yeah.

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:16.715
Oh, well.
She wouldn't have made probation anyway.

01:03:16.791 --> 01:03:17.791
Hell, no.

01:03:17.874 --> 01:03:18.920
What, because her daddy's not a captain?

01:03:18.999 --> 01:03:20.749
You know she wasn't cut out for this shit.

01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:22.550
- Why is that?
- The evidence.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:24.300
She almost got Van Hauser killed.

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:27.296
You guys are cold, man.
You got cold, dead eyes. You know that?

01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:28.567
Yeah, both of us.

01:03:28.624 --> 01:03:29.921
Yeah, both of you. You have a soul?

01:03:29.958 --> 01:03:31.674
Yes, we just leave it at home.

01:03:31.749 --> 01:03:34.466
Yo, we gonna sit around yapping
or we gonna get this done?

01:03:34.542 --> 01:03:36.383
Dude, you guys saved that rookie's life.

01:03:36.458 --> 01:03:38.379
That was one big fucking fat <i>ese.</i>

01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:40.333
Can we clear the scene?

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:42.095
Division's fucking falling apart over here.

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:44.217
We good? You good?
Good, good, good?

01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:45.257
We're all good.

01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:46.413
Yes? Go back to work.

01:03:46.417 --> 01:03:47.567
Good night, ladies.

01:03:51.916 --> 01:03:55.543
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing Officer and Mrs. Taylor.</i>

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:08.042
Go, Brian!

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.091
What's up, guys?

01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:07.924
How's the cake? Good?

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:21.833
Cheers!

01:05:38.624 --> 01:05:40.091
Fuck.

01:05:40.749 --> 01:05:42.170
All right.

01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:47.837
Janet, you got a lot of heart
hooking up with a cop.

01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:50.791
Because it takes a strong person,

01:05:50.874 --> 01:05:53.216
and I see like a lot of cops' wives in here,

01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:54.711
they're all nodding their heads.

01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:57.666
You gotta take care of her, bro.

01:05:58.541 --> 01:05:59.837
'Cause I'm her big brother now.

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:02.004
And every cop in here,

01:06:03.457 --> 01:06:05.003
we're all her family now, too.

01:06:09.208 --> 01:06:11.129
I'm going to cry, baby, shut up.

01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.383
And Janet,

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:16.840
we're all hoping that you can
make a man out of Brian,

01:06:16.916 --> 01:06:18.234
because we've all given up.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.708
So here we go.

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:24.587
To Brian and Janet.

01:06:25.999 --> 01:06:27.149
Cheers!

01:06:33.582 --> 01:06:35.083
Can I ask you something?

01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:39.133
Why the fuck did you get married
in your dress blues?

01:06:39.208 --> 01:06:40.628
If you worked at Best Buy,

01:06:40.707 --> 01:06:42.506
would you wear that fucking
stupid polo shirt?

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:44.758
I like that polo shirt.

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:46.583
I'm representing, man.

01:06:49.166 --> 01:06:50.416
You know I love you, man?

01:06:50.499 --> 01:06:51.649
Oh, Jesus.

01:06:51.749 --> 01:06:52.965
Here they go again.

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:54.586
I love you, too, bro.

01:06:55.499 --> 01:06:57.591
- I would lay down my life for you, dude.
- "I love you, man."

01:06:57.666 --> 01:06:59.465
I would take a fucking bullet for you.

01:06:59.541 --> 01:07:00.587
"I love you, man."

01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:03.213
Get married to each other because...

01:07:03.291 --> 01:07:05.711
All right, shut up.
Everybody take a shot.

01:07:15.624 --> 01:07:17.296
Cheers!

01:07:23.166 --> 01:07:24.416
My boy Garcia?

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.507
He's a fucking beast, man. Right?

01:07:27.582 --> 01:07:31.333
I've seen this motherfucker knock
an asshole out with one punch.

01:07:31.624 --> 01:07:33.920
Yoked assholes, man.
Yoked assholes

01:07:33.999 --> 01:07:35.555
from the joint when they had weight piles.

01:07:35.582 --> 01:07:36.628
You know what I'm talking about?

01:07:36.707 --> 01:07:39.345
You don't know what I'm talking about,
you're fucking 12 years old.

01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:41.008
Cops like him...

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.583
Like soldiers.

01:07:46.332 --> 01:07:48.174
He took a bullet for me.

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:52.883
My bullet, man. He took my bullet.

01:07:57.291 --> 01:08:01.883
He took my bullet. That's what he was.
That's what he was to me.

01:08:02.457 --> 01:08:05.254
It should have been me.
'Cause he was a good guy.

01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:08.548
I was shit.

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:12.628
Fuck it, man.

01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:23.316
<i>Give me a kiss.</i>

01:08:24.374 --> 01:08:25.670
You'll learn this. You'll learn.

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:29.295
Marriage is really basic.

01:08:29.374 --> 01:08:32.500
Right? There's just, like,
a couple guidelines.

01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:34.590
One, you gotta give it up all the time.

01:08:36.374 --> 01:08:38.374
- All the time.
- You love that.

01:08:38.791 --> 01:08:40.917
I don't hate that idea.

01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:42.541
- It's not a bad thing.
- It's not a bad idea.

01:08:42.624 --> 01:08:45.670
No, seriously, girls throw it at cops.

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:47.004
Throw what exactly?

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:49.832
Their pussy. Girls throw it.

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:51.837
So you can't give him an excuse, girlfriend.

01:08:51.916 --> 01:08:53.131
You cannot give him an excuse.

01:08:53.207 --> 01:08:55.082
I've actually seen that before.

01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:57.166
It's called assault on a peace officer.

01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:58.791
- I'll give you another one. You ready?
- Hell, yeah.

01:08:58.874 --> 01:09:01.256
- Be a freak. Try new things.
- Part two. Baby...

01:09:01.332 --> 01:09:03.207
Like, you know, the gooch.

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:04.461
- The what?
- No, no, no, no.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:05.712
The gooch?

01:09:05.916 --> 01:09:07.541
Texas twister.

01:09:07.624 --> 01:09:10.625
No, that's something that's made up.
The Internet made that up.

01:09:10.832 --> 01:09:12.112
You want to know what Mike likes?

01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:13.295
No!

01:09:17.624 --> 01:09:19.545
- Babe!
- No! Babe, I love you so much.

01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:22.209
The western, you know?
Open to explore, right?

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:23.711
Gabby! It's our wedding!

01:09:23.832 --> 01:09:25.175
- Cup him. Suck him.
- This is way too much.

01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:26.841
- Cup him and suck him.
- You're cut off.

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:28.212
You just rub it a bit and then...

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.410
What the fuck? Gabby!

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:30.758
Venture off a little bit more.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.072
- No, no, no!
- Venture off?

01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:33.924
They swear they don't like it, but...

01:09:33.999 --> 01:09:35.439
Shit. Dude, really?

01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:41.332
I'm happy, man.

01:09:42.499 --> 01:09:45.295
I'm happy, bro. Janet's dope, dude.

01:09:52.624 --> 01:09:56.341
You're my brother and everything, dude,
but you're a piece of shit.

01:09:57.499 --> 01:09:58.920
Does she know that?

01:10:01.707 --> 01:10:03.548
Yeah, she knows who I am.

01:10:06.958 --> 01:10:09.959
I mean, you can't get into something
with somebody without...

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.795
She knows who I am.

01:10:13.624 --> 01:10:17.500
Yeah. I know who you are.
You're a piece of shit.

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:22.458
If you break her heart,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:10:24.374 --> 01:10:26.170
Good to know.

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:38.875
If anything happened to you,
I would take care of your kids.

01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:42.254
If you had any.
And I would take care of her.

01:10:45.457 --> 01:10:47.332
I would take care of Janet.

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:04.879

01:11:09.249 --> 01:11:11.215
Let's see here.

01:11:11.707 --> 01:11:13.628
Business dispute.
Request police mediation.

01:11:13.707 --> 01:11:14.832
One neighbor threw a cup of water

01:11:14.916 --> 01:11:16.007
on the other neighbor's window.

01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:17.833
Yeah, we're not buying that.

01:11:17.999 --> 01:11:20.091
3-90 male. Intoxicated person
outside a liquor store.

01:11:20.499 --> 01:11:21.590
Get the fuck out of here.

01:11:21.666 --> 01:11:24.337
There's a drunk man
outside the liquor store?

01:11:25.999 --> 01:11:29.499
Welfare check.
Woman requests PD contact her elderly mother.

01:11:29.582 --> 01:11:31.253
- Yeah, buy that one.
- You serious?

01:11:31.332 --> 01:11:32.503
Yeah, if we buy a couple of these,

01:11:32.582 --> 01:11:33.981
maybe they'll send us a Code 3 call.

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:35.583
All right. Cool.

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:37.281
I'll hit her up for the next hotshots.

01:11:37.332 --> 01:11:39.207
"On this episode, we're rolling to a call."

01:11:39.457 --> 01:11:42.503
"A woman called the station
to check on her elderly mother."

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:44.291
"So we're gonna go."

01:11:44.374 --> 01:11:46.732
Yeah, these are the calls
most agencies deal with, you know?

01:11:46.749 --> 01:11:48.841
Not every call's a foot pursuit
or a car chase.

01:11:49.124 --> 01:11:50.420
Some guys at other agencies

01:11:50.499 --> 01:11:52.420
have never even drawn their weapon
or been in a gunfight.

01:11:52.499 --> 01:11:54.092
Yeah, but here,
that's just half your shift.

01:11:54.165 --> 01:11:55.256
In the south end,

01:11:55.332 --> 01:11:57.611
we'll get involved in more capers
in one deployment period

01:11:57.666 --> 01:11:59.666
than most cops see their entire career.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:01.336
Hell, yeah.

01:12:04.249 --> 01:12:05.465
Mrs. Williams!

01:12:10.833 --> 01:12:13.379
Mrs. Williams! Police officers!

01:12:14.207 --> 01:12:15.503
Go around the back, check it out.

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:17.173
All right. Here we go.

01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:21.058
<i>I'm gonna wait for my partner.
He's gonna check the back</i>

01:12:21.165 --> 01:12:22.844
to see if she's around the back over there.

01:12:23.165 --> 01:12:26.007
Oftentimes, a lot of these people,
they're very old people.

01:12:26.457 --> 01:12:30.253
They can't hear us.
You know, they can't hear the...

01:12:30.332 --> 01:12:31.503
Hearing aids, you know. So...

01:12:31.582 --> 01:12:32.732
Nothing.

01:12:32.833 --> 01:12:35.049
All right, so the owner
of this house is actually

01:12:35.124 --> 01:12:36.763
the daughter of the woman who lives in it.

01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:40.208
She gave us permission for the welfare check,
so we're gonna...

01:12:40.999 --> 01:12:42.920
We're gonna boot the door.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.666
Officer Zavala specializes in booting doors.

01:12:46.749 --> 01:12:47.965
I kick doors down.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.256
There you go.

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:50.799
I kick doors down.

01:12:51.666 --> 01:12:53.041
Say it in English now, bro.

01:12:53.124 --> 01:12:54.274
I kick doors down.

01:12:54.332 --> 01:12:55.851
Wait, did you check if it was unlocked?

01:12:57.249 --> 01:13:00.671
Ladies and gentlemen, always a good idea
to make sure a door is locked

01:13:01.207 --> 01:13:02.378
before you boot it.

01:13:02.457 --> 01:13:04.082
- Are you gonna cut that out?
- Yeah, sorry.

01:13:04.165 --> 01:13:06.757
It was always locked.
Clearly my partner always knew that.

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:09.174
Oh, man.
You know what's gonna happen, right?

01:13:09.249 --> 01:13:10.465
What?

01:13:10.541 --> 01:13:13.917
She's gonna roll through,
come from church or the store or whatever.

01:13:13.998 --> 01:13:15.419
And then she's gonna see property damage

01:13:15.499 --> 01:13:17.129
and what's gonna happen?
What's gonna happen?

01:13:17.165 --> 01:13:18.416
We're gonna be the bad guys.

01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:25.675
Oh, shit! We got a dead body, man.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.333
What have we got? Squatters?

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:43.508
Yeah, <i>eses</i> have been kicking
it back here for sure.

01:13:45.165 --> 01:13:46.541
LAPD.

01:13:46.624 --> 01:13:47.774
Let's roll through.

01:14:03.457 --> 01:14:05.503
- You good?
- Clear.

01:14:12.666 --> 01:14:14.041
- That is wrong.
- Dude, I said it was clear.

01:14:14.165 --> 01:14:16.507
All right. I'm just filming it, man.

01:14:30.416 --> 01:14:32.132
- I found her, dude.
- What's up?

01:14:44.457 --> 01:14:45.607
13 X-ray 13.

01:14:45.666 --> 01:14:48.185
I'm gonna need a supervisor
and two additional units at our location.

01:14:48.249 --> 01:14:52.751
An RA for an elderly female,
approximately 70 years old.

01:14:54.249 --> 01:14:55.408
Not conscious, not breathing.

01:14:56.165 --> 01:14:59.462
<i>13 X 13's requesting
two additional units and a supervisor.</i>

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:01.212
<i>5-1-7-1 Maple.</i>

01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:03.791
<i>Incident 1-4-6-7, RA 13-51.</i>

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:06.874
What is she, grandma praying
to the dope gods or some shit?

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.132
Dude, that's not fucking grandma.

01:15:14.749 --> 01:15:16.465
- Don't fucking play on them.
- No, look.

01:15:17.541 --> 01:15:20.882
Hollow. Somebody's opened it before, dude.
That's what that means.

01:15:22.582 --> 01:15:23.582
Pick that shit up.

01:15:23.666 --> 01:15:24.864
You can't pull it out yourself?

01:15:24.873 --> 01:15:26.715
Dude, just fucking pull it out, bro.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.291
Party time.

01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:43.166
Yo, Z. Z.

01:15:47.998 --> 01:15:49.169
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:51.337
- What?
- Do you see that pot?

01:15:51.457 --> 01:15:52.673
Yeah.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.915
- That shit's still steaming.
- Oh, shit.

01:15:55.998 --> 01:15:57.964
- I'm going in. Ready?
- Go ahead.

01:16:04.832 --> 01:16:06.504
Brian, Brian.

01:16:15.865 --> 01:16:17.541
What is that?
Dude, is that a body?

01:16:17.624 --> 01:16:19.624
Yeah, there's bodies in there, dude.

01:16:19.707 --> 01:16:21.082
Thanks for the fucking update.

01:16:23.957 --> 01:16:25.333
Fuck, man.

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:27.174
Is it clear, dude?

01:16:28.257 --> 01:16:29.407
Clear.

01:16:30.165 --> 01:16:31.632
What does it say, dude?

01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:33.166
What's that shit say?

01:16:33.249 --> 01:16:35.750
"Keep bringing them. Ha ha ha."

01:16:39.915 --> 01:16:43.416
Fuck! Come on.
Get your shit together, dude.

01:16:43.499 --> 01:16:45.591
Pull your shit together, man.

01:16:52.582 --> 01:16:55.423
Fuck out of here.
Let's get out of here.

01:16:58.207 --> 01:17:02.958
Fuck. Sick motherfuckers, man.
Who would do shit like that?

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:19.253
What is that shit, dude?

01:17:19.332 --> 01:17:23.049
I don't fucking know, dude.
I've never seen that kind of shit.

01:17:25.666 --> 01:17:27.777
You have those fucking...
Do you have hand sanitizer, bro?

01:17:27.832 --> 01:17:28.878
No, I don't.

01:17:28.957 --> 01:17:31.378
<i>I'm Serene Branson,

<i>In addition to the drugs,

<i>there was a very gruesome discovery.</i>

<i>An unknown number of bodies

<i>A police official familiar

<i>denied rumors Mexican drug cartels</i>

<i>Newton units, information only

want to roll to the Dodgers game
with us tonight.

01:18:47.165 --> 01:18:48.586
Dude, we're going to Santa Barbara.

01:18:48.665 --> 01:18:49.916
All right, fuck you then, dude,

01:18:49.998 --> 01:18:51.480
I'll sell that shit online or something.

01:18:54.499 --> 01:18:56.170
Oh, here's Tre right here.

01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:57.877
What's up, Tre?

01:18:57.957 --> 01:18:59.333
What's up, back?

01:19:01.457 --> 01:19:02.877
What you doing?

01:19:03.165 --> 01:19:04.541
I'm doing what I do,
you know what I'm saying?

01:19:04.624 --> 01:19:06.090
Same shit, different day.

01:19:06.165 --> 01:19:08.382
Ain't shit changed.
What's up with y'all?

01:19:08.998 --> 01:19:10.169
Just slow motion.

01:19:10.499 --> 01:19:12.017
And that little incident
you and I had?

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.257
You kept it G.

01:19:14.582 --> 01:19:17.002
You didn't snitch on me.
And I respect that.

01:19:17.623 --> 01:19:20.965
So check this out,
my people just got out of Folsom Prison.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.291
- From up north.
- Oh, yeah?

01:19:22.374 --> 01:19:24.965
Word is you got a hit on y'all, man.
Y'all been greenlit.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.461
Come on, man. We're cops,
everybody wants to kill us, Tre.

01:19:27.541 --> 01:19:30.087
Hey, I'm just telling you
what they're saying, man.

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:32.336
No, you know what,
we appreciate the info, man,

01:19:32.416 --> 01:19:34.916
but this don't mean you get a pass
if we catch you slipping.

01:19:34.998 --> 01:19:36.249
I ain't looking for no fucking pass.

01:19:36.332 --> 01:19:37.957
I do what I do,
you know what I'm saying?

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:40.336
I had to say it, though,
you know how it is.

01:19:40.499 --> 01:19:41.840
All right, what you doing this weekend, Tre?

01:19:41.998 --> 01:19:43.214
You like the Dodgers?

01:19:43.332 --> 01:19:44.752
You gonna slide a nigga
some tickets or something?

01:19:44.832 --> 01:19:46.253
- Hey, man...
- You like the Dodgers?

01:19:46.332 --> 01:19:47.503
Have a good weekend.

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:48.780
Slide me some tickets.

01:19:48.832 --> 01:19:50.029
Shut the fuck up!

01:19:55.790 --> 01:20:00.292
Dude, did you fuck with my...
Come on, man, did you fuck with my shit?

01:20:00.873 --> 01:20:02.545
I don't fuck with your shit.

01:20:03.541 --> 01:20:04.756
Damn it, Mike, come on, man.

01:20:04.832 --> 01:20:06.351
Don't be a little bitch about it, dude.

01:20:06.416 --> 01:20:07.586
I didn't fuck with your shit, dude.

01:20:07.665 --> 01:20:09.983
You fucked with my shit.
It was in totally different order.

01:20:09.998 --> 01:20:12.249
Why do you have an investigation report
on here, dude?

01:20:12.332 --> 01:20:13.957
I don't have an investigation report on there.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.461
It's your handwriting.
Don't be an idiot.

01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:18.007
All this is fucked up.
Did you drop it or something?

01:20:18.082 --> 01:20:20.299
Dude, there's three types of pages.

01:20:20.374 --> 01:20:23.500
Man! It's all out of order, man.
It's all fucking out of order.

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:26.882
No, it's a pain in the ass.
I'm sorry, partner.

01:20:30.665 --> 01:20:32.166
Wait until they hit a small street.

01:20:32.374 --> 01:20:33.930
At a stop sign,
you fucking tap the bumper,

01:20:33.998 --> 01:20:35.497
we're gonna get out and blast.

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:37.376
- Fuck, no.
- What do you mean, no?

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.124
We should get 'em when they go to lunch
at that Chinese place.

01:20:40.207 --> 01:20:41.627
That Chinese place is crawling with cops.

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:43.581
We gotta get these fuckers
when they're alone.

01:20:43.665 --> 01:20:45.916
We can fucking follow their asses home
and hit 'em there.

01:20:45.998 --> 01:20:47.996
<i>Mira,</i> homegirl,

We gotta get these fuckers
at the same time!

01:20:51.332 --> 01:20:54.208
E, this is one time, homie.
Not a bunch of fucking niggas.

Motherfucker! This fucker is straight
from the SHU, homeboy!

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.131
You stop fucking around.

01:20:58.207 --> 01:20:59.298
You got in the car.

01:20:59.374 --> 01:21:00.919
You want to fucking hang

of fucking admission, homeboy.

01:21:03.832 --> 01:21:07.129
I'll fucking kill this fucking bitch,
all right? You shut the fuck up.

01:21:07.249 --> 01:21:08.749
- Come on, E.
- You get that shit out of my face.

01:21:08.832 --> 01:21:11.504
I'll fucking kill you, motherfucker.
Don't you fucking disrespect.

01:21:11.623 --> 01:21:13.340
Don't worry. I got this shit.
Fuck, man.

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:16.132
I don't know where the fucking rubber band
is either, dude.

01:21:16.207 --> 01:21:17.582
Don't blame me for the rubber band.

01:21:17.665 --> 01:21:19.041
You just took the rubber band off.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:20.590
If you hadn't fucking put
everything out of order,

01:21:20.665 --> 01:21:22.257
then the rubber band
wouldn't be out and the...

01:21:22.332 --> 01:21:24.082
Look, it's the butterfly effect, okay?

01:21:24.165 --> 01:21:25.585
Do you know what the butterfly effect is?

01:21:25.665 --> 01:21:26.665
Nope.

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:29.044
It's the butterfly effect.
Look it up.

01:21:29.124 --> 01:21:30.204
Just 'cause you say it twice

01:21:30.207 --> 01:21:31.627
doesn't mean that I get it
the second time.

01:21:31.706 --> 01:21:33.332
Look it up, dude.

01:21:34.332 --> 01:21:37.458
This is fucking stupid.
Those motherfuckers got bulletproof vests.

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:38.631
We need to hit them
with some AKs and shit.

01:21:38.706 --> 01:21:39.922
Don't fucking rank out.

01:21:39.998 --> 01:21:41.623
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:21:41.706 --> 01:21:43.877
When the fuck have I ever backed out
from shit, huh?

01:21:44.832 --> 01:21:46.582
Get that fucking camera
out of my face!

01:21:46.665 --> 01:21:49.882
I'm saying, we just can't fuck
this shit up.

01:21:50.957 --> 01:21:53.458
I don't give a fuck, man.
You know me.

01:21:53.623 --> 01:21:55.249
I'll do the motherfucking time.

01:21:55.332 --> 01:21:57.752
I just don't want the big homies
fucking whacking me.

01:21:58.623 --> 01:22:00.999
Fucking whacking me for fucking up.

01:22:02.498 --> 01:22:04.874
We need a fucking plan.
And you fucking know it, homie.

01:22:05.665 --> 01:22:08.916
Think about it. That's all I'm saying.

01:22:14.332 --> 01:22:15.482
Okay, head back.

01:22:16.207 --> 01:22:18.673
I'll get some fucking big guns
from the Border Brothers.

01:22:27.374 --> 01:22:29.420
Never fall asleep in a room full of cops.

01:22:32.006 --> 01:22:33.156
What...

01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:37.007
Zavala, that shit ain't even fucking funny!

01:22:37.998 --> 01:22:39.436
Just 'cause you won the fucking award

01:22:39.456 --> 01:22:41.378
doesn't give you license
to be a fucking asshole!

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:42.975
You got shit on your face, man.

01:22:42.998 --> 01:22:46.419
Hey! Hey! What is this?
What are we, in the third fucking grade?

01:22:46.498 --> 01:22:49.249
Keep it up, it's gonna earn you
a risk management case.

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:50.547
Give me this fucking camera.

01:22:50.623 --> 01:22:51.714
He had something...

01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:53.506
I'm serious, man.
This department built you up,

01:22:53.581 --> 01:22:55.378
they will fucking tear you down.

01:22:55.456 --> 01:22:56.422
You know it's fucking funny.

01:22:56.498 --> 01:22:57.874
Laugh, you fucking idiot.

01:22:57.957 --> 01:23:00.253
Who left their shaving cream on the table?

01:23:06.623 --> 01:23:07.999
How was Santa Barbara?

01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:12.006
Awesome.

01:23:16.665 --> 01:23:17.836
Janet's pregnant.

01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:19.498
What?

01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:22.256
Get out of here, bro.
Are you serious?

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:25.257
Already? She's not even Mexican.

01:23:25.998 --> 01:23:28.090
Yeah, she's going for the ultrasound tomorrow,

01:23:28.165 --> 01:23:29.380
but three of those piss stick things...

01:23:29.456 --> 01:23:30.606
Yeah, yeah, EPTs, yeah.

01:23:30.665 --> 01:23:32.086
Positive, positive, positive.

01:23:32.764 --> 01:23:33.585
Dude.

01:23:33.665 --> 01:23:36.291
Congrats, bro. Congrats.

01:23:38.623 --> 01:23:40.090
That's when we fucking graduate.

01:23:40.165 --> 01:23:41.756
We fucking get the upgrade right now.

01:23:41.832 --> 01:23:44.208
Not fucking gonna be little fucking <i>paisas</i>
no fucking more.

01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:46.448
- Right? That's what we're gonna do.
- I'm with you.

01:23:46.456 --> 01:23:47.606
Okay?

01:23:47.665 --> 01:23:50.147
They want to come into our fucking hood
and fucking talk shit to us?

01:23:50.249 --> 01:23:52.045
- You fucking do this shit right?
- It's our fucking hood.

01:23:52.124 --> 01:23:53.124
They don't fucking disrespect us.

01:23:53.207 --> 01:23:54.582
You guys want to fucking collect?

01:23:54.665 --> 01:23:55.904
You guys got to fucking put up.

01:23:55.915 --> 01:23:57.756
- This time we're gonna do it right.
- Yeah, we're doing this.

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.832
Fucking guys have some fucking balls.

01:23:59.915 --> 01:24:03.086
Hey, trip though, E,
after we get these motherfuckers,

01:24:03.832 --> 01:24:05.924
you know,

01:24:05.998 --> 01:24:08.435
it's gonna be a little hot in the hood, though.
Right, La La?

01:24:08.498 --> 01:24:10.124
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here after that.

01:24:10.207 --> 01:24:12.878
I'm gonna fucking take you guys
to fucking Vegas.

01:24:12.957 --> 01:24:15.503
You guys fucking do this shit right,
I'm gonna treat you right.

01:24:15.665 --> 01:24:16.916
But if we don't fucking do this,

01:24:16.998 --> 01:24:19.839
we can never fucking come back,
that's the fucking thing.

01:24:22.665 --> 01:24:23.904
Wouldn't it be crazy if our kids

01:24:23.957 --> 01:24:25.735
were pushing a black
and white together one day?

01:24:25.832 --> 01:24:29.174
Screw that.
I want my kid to have an honest job.

01:24:29.915 --> 01:24:31.086
Like a politician.

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.290
Oh, idiot.

01:24:38.415 --> 01:24:39.586
Light 'em up.

01:24:42.581 --> 01:24:43.923
He's running.

01:24:43.998 --> 01:24:46.515

Yeah, you're clear right, go, go, go, go.
Fuck, yeah.

You got this motherfucker.
You got this motherfucker. Come on, Z.

01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:04.940

Jesus fucking Christ. Fuck.

01:25:09.165 --> 01:25:12.006
Go, get the fuck out of the car.
Go, go, go!

01:25:15.832 --> 01:25:17.332

Shit!

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:30.252
Fuck!

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.460

Fuck. Go.

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:42.086
Go, go, go!

01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:45.166
- Dude! Dude!

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:47.357
Move!

01:25:48.748 --> 01:25:50.169
Tell her to get down, bro!

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.232
Fuck.

01:25:56.373 --> 01:25:58.544
Shit, dude, no dice, man.
We're fucking trapped.

01:25:58.623 --> 01:25:59.714
Dude, call dispatch.

01:25:59.790 --> 01:26:00.940
My fucking hand, man.

01:26:01.415 --> 01:26:02.586
What's up? What, you got hit?

01:26:02.665 --> 01:26:04.086
- Did you get hit?
- Shit.

01:26:04.623 --> 01:26:05.773
Fucking call dispatch.

01:26:06.456 --> 01:26:08.252
I got no signal! Fuck!

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:10.877
Fuck, I don't...

01:26:12.581 --> 01:26:13.731
Fuckers.

01:26:14.605 --> 01:26:15.755
Shut up!

01:26:18.415 --> 01:26:19.586
This is 13 X-ray 13...

01:26:19.665 --> 01:26:21.256
Come through the fucking door.

01:26:21.623 --> 01:26:23.124
- Come on.
- Officers need help!

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.836
We're barricaded in an apartment building.

01:26:34.415 --> 01:26:35.506
Shit!

01:26:35.581 --> 01:26:36.581

01:26:36.665 --> 01:26:38.064
Tell that bitch to shut the fuck up!

01:26:52.331 --> 01:26:53.582
Tell her to be quiet, Z!

01:26:53.832 --> 01:26:56.548
25022 Hooper Place, apartment C.

01:26:56.748 --> 01:26:58.498
Those motherfuckers are in there.

01:26:59.124 --> 01:27:00.457
We're all good, we're all good, bro!

01:27:00.498 --> 01:27:03.017
They're sending the cavalry,
they're sending the whole fucking world.

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:12.690
Fuck!

01:27:13.873 --> 01:27:15.248
Shit! Fuck!

01:27:35.498 --> 01:27:36.714
Bro, you all good?

01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:37.881
Yeah.

01:27:37.957 --> 01:27:39.753
- Wasn't Big Evil in the army?
- Yeah.

01:27:39.832 --> 01:27:42.276
We can't hold them off.
We gotta lay down a base of fire and pivot.

01:27:42.331 --> 01:27:43.691
What the fuck does that mean, dude?

01:27:43.748 --> 01:27:44.919
We're shooting our way out of here, bro.

01:27:44.998 --> 01:27:46.044
Can these fools get out?

01:27:46.123 --> 01:27:48.568
Yeah, we got these motherfuckers, homie.
Dudes ain't going nowhere.

01:27:48.623 --> 01:27:50.168
Z, look at me. All right? Look at me.

01:27:50.248 --> 01:27:51.398
Okay, okay.

01:27:51.456 --> 01:27:54.003
On three, dude,
you're gonna empty your mag and run.

01:27:54.082 --> 01:27:55.582
- Okay, okay.
- You ready?

01:27:55.665 --> 01:27:58.041
One. Two. Three!

01:28:05.623 --> 01:28:08.715
Go! Move! Move! Move!
To the door, Z, to the door!

01:28:19.832 --> 01:28:21.707
Move, Z! Go! Go!

01:28:22.832 --> 01:28:24.582
Move, man, move, move, move!

01:28:35.206 --> 01:28:37.423
Over the fence, man.
You see the fence?

01:28:37.498 --> 01:28:39.294
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Z! Z! Move, move! Take the left.

01:29:29.873 --> 01:29:31.339
I think we killed that guy.

01:29:31.915 --> 01:29:33.065
Good.

01:29:36.289 --> 01:29:37.756
Just the dogs.

01:29:37.832 --> 01:29:39.423
Where's the fucking cavalry, man?

01:29:39.581 --> 01:29:40.731
I don't know!

01:29:54.456 --> 01:29:55.832
- Partner?
- What?

01:29:57.206 --> 01:29:59.002
This sucks.

01:30:05.289 --> 01:30:08.005
Is that us? Is that PD?

01:30:12.415 --> 01:30:14.211
Slow, slow, slow.

01:30:14.789 --> 01:30:16.506
Z! Gun! Hit them!

01:30:24.665 --> 01:30:26.757
Curbside Gang, <i>putos!</i>

Wait, wait. Let me see. Let me see.

01:30:45.881 --> 01:30:47.031
Fuck, dude.

01:30:49.456 --> 01:30:51.582
It's bad. It's bad. You know what?

01:30:51.665 --> 01:30:54.290
But I've seen guys way worse make it.

01:30:58.081 --> 01:30:59.457
Dude, what are you fucking doing?

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:00.660
Don't fucking do that to me!

01:31:00.665 --> 01:31:01.711
Stay right there!

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:05.256
Stay the fuck down! Stay down,
I need to put pressure on your wound.

01:31:08.914 --> 01:31:11.006
Where the fuck is everybody?

01:31:12.832 --> 01:31:13.982
I don't want to die here, dude.

01:31:14.039 --> 01:31:15.130
You're not gonna die here.

01:31:15.206 --> 01:31:17.673
You're not gonna die.
God loves cops.

01:31:20.081 --> 01:31:22.423
I fucked up, dude. I fucked up.

01:31:24.123 --> 01:31:26.340
Don't tell Janet I fucked up.

01:31:38.081 --> 01:31:39.582
I'm gonna stay right here, bro.

01:31:39.665 --> 01:31:43.006
I'm gonna stay right here, okay?
It's okay. It's okay.

01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:44.832
Do it, dude. It's okay.

01:31:46.248 --> 01:31:48.248
It's okay to do it right now, bro.

01:31:49.331 --> 01:31:51.127
I fucking love you, bro.

01:32:04.039 --> 01:32:06.756
Officer down! I need some fucking help!

01:32:06.832 --> 01:32:08.877

Please don't go right now.

01:32:15.164 --> 01:32:17.836
I'm begging you, bro,
don't fucking go right now.

01:32:18.373 --> 01:32:20.123
Don't go right now.

01:32:32.248 --> 01:32:33.919
What the fuck?

01:33:28.997 --> 01:33:30.838
Happy fucking ending, homies.

01:33:30.914 --> 01:33:32.540
Hell, yeah. Celebration time.

01:33:32.706 --> 01:33:34.422
Look at the streets of LA.

01:37:06.456 --> 01:37:07.876
Shit.

01:37:47.831 --> 01:37:49.627
He was my brother.

01:39:15.539 --> 01:39:17.710
Yo, if your kid was a girl,
would you let her be a cop?

01:39:18.664 --> 01:39:21.085
Bro, would I want my daughter
packing a burner

01:39:21.164 --> 01:39:23.256
so she could protect herself
from the assholes of the world?

01:39:23.331 --> 01:39:24.672
Hell, yeah.

01:39:24.747 --> 01:39:26.918
I want to have a daughter, man.
That would be so cool.

01:39:26.997 --> 01:39:28.293
Just don't let her date cops.

01:39:28.414 --> 01:39:30.086
- She's not dating anyone.
- Okay.

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:32.039
- Ever.
- All right.

01:39:34.414 --> 01:39:37.040
Did I ever tell you about the first time
I spent the night with Gabby?

01:39:37.123 --> 01:39:38.964
I don't want to hear that, dude.

01:39:39.455 --> 01:39:41.047
Dude, I got a hella big family, right?

01:39:41.123 --> 01:39:42.839
See? Fuck, dude,
I don't want to hear that.

01:39:42.914 --> 01:39:44.585
I got a hella big family, bro.

01:39:44.664 --> 01:39:46.165
Someone's always at my house, right?

01:39:46.248 --> 01:39:48.214
But one time, Gabby's parents
bounced to Ensenada

01:39:48.289 --> 01:39:49.459
and her brother crashed at his girlfriend's.

01:39:49.539 --> 01:39:50.799
So I spent the night at her house.

01:39:51.622 --> 01:39:53.149
And this was gonna be the night, dude.

01:39:53.831 --> 01:39:56.332
It was gonna be the night,
do you know what I'm saying?

01:39:56.414 --> 01:39:57.756
No, what are you talking about?

01:39:57.831 --> 01:39:59.173
Well, I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

01:39:59.248 --> 01:40:00.248
Okay, cool.

01:40:00.331 --> 01:40:01.421
So we're in her parents' bed, right?

01:40:01.497 --> 01:40:02.463
Yeah.

01:40:02.539 --> 01:40:04.211
And it's on. It's about to go down.

01:40:04.289 --> 01:40:05.567
I'm taking off her <i>chones,</i> I'm...

01:40:05.622 --> 01:40:06.838
<i>Chones?</i> What are...

01:40:06.914 --> 01:40:08.193
Her skivvies, dawg, come on, bro.

01:40:08.248 --> 01:40:09.463
Oh, right.

01:40:09.664 --> 01:40:12.336
And I'm like finally, right?
Fucking finally!

01:40:12.664 --> 01:40:15.256
But then we hear this noise.
Dude, someone's in the pad.

01:40:15.497 --> 01:40:18.794
So I hide underneath the bed.
And then I hear people coming up.

01:40:19.081 --> 01:40:20.300
And it's her parents.

01:40:21.164 --> 01:40:22.414
This is the second floor, bro.

01:40:22.664 --> 01:40:23.710
What?

01:40:23.789 --> 01:40:24.789
I got nowhere to go.

01:40:24.872 --> 01:40:27.280
Homegirl's trying to distract them,
but it ain't happening, right?

01:40:27.331 --> 01:40:28.672
And the footsteps grow louder.

01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:31.173
Louder and louder. Then the door opens...

01:40:31.248 --> 01:40:34.418
Oh, my God, bro,
I'm naked underneath the bed.

01:40:34.497 --> 01:40:36.418
And then all I can see
is little footsteps.

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:39.089
I see his hairy feet
and I see her nails all painted,

01:40:39.164 --> 01:40:41.539
and they're right there yapping,
they're doing their thing.

01:40:41.747 --> 01:40:44.839
And they crash. And this is the part
that I never told Gabby.

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:47.831
I hear a little smoochie smooch,
and I hear some shit,

01:40:47.956 --> 01:40:49.797
and I'm like praying, "Please, no."

01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:52.047
- And they did it, bro.
- What?

01:40:52.289 --> 01:40:53.289
They got down, dude!

01:40:53.372 --> 01:40:54.522
What!

01:40:54.789 --> 01:40:57.585
I'm talking Gabby's parents fucking, dude!

01:40:57.664 --> 01:40:59.414
- All right, I got it.
- No!

01:40:59.831 --> 01:41:02.048
That shit was so traumatic, man.

01:41:02.206 --> 01:41:04.172
You must have been a little uncomfortable

01:41:04.248 --> 01:41:06.248
around her folks after that.

01:41:06.956 --> 01:41:09.797
Yeah, bro, 'cause her father is a freak.

01:41:10.248 --> 01:41:12.089
Dude, I guess when
you've been married that long,

01:41:12.164 --> 01:41:13.442
you gotta mix it up a little bit.

01:41:13.789 --> 01:41:15.585
I tried rolling like that with Gabby
and she was like,

01:41:15.664 --> 01:41:18.131
"Hell, no, you're not touching me there."

01:41:20.497 --> 01:41:22.248
It makes me fucking uncomfortable, man.

01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:24.797
I know, I know, you know why?
'Cause you're a freak, too.

01:41:24.872 --> 01:41:26.793
Don't go there, bro,
just don't go there.

01:41:28.164 --> 01:41:31.460
I fucking can't breathe.
Holy shit.

01:41:32.956 --> 01:41:34.456
<i>Any Newton unit...</i>

01:41:42.622 --> 01:41:43.747
