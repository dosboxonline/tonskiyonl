AUGUSTO PINOCHET UGARTE
MY PATH - MEMOIRS OF A MILITARY MAN

03:48.250 --> 03:50.166
I don't recall this. It's not true.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.541
And even if it were,
I have no memory of it.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.833
-You're caught!
-What are you doing?

04:00.916 --> 04:02.500
-You will die.
-What are you doing?

04:04.333 --> 04:05.583
Drop it!

04:08.833 --> 04:10.000
Be careful!

05:31.666 --> 05:33.250
Long live freedom!

06:30.041 --> 06:31.291
Farewell…

06:32.458 --> 06:33.916
Claude Pinoche.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.250
MARIE ANTOINETTE OF AUSTRIA
QUEEN OF FRANCE AND NAVARRE

07:30.833 --> 07:33.416
I, Second Lieutenant
Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, swear…

07:42.375 --> 07:45.333
…fulfill my duties,
in accordance with laws and regulations.

07:45.416 --> 07:47.083
To promptly obey orders…

07:50.208 --> 07:52.666
…in order to be a brave
and honorable soldier…

09:47.333 --> 09:48.708
Papi, what's wrong?

09:48.791 --> 09:51.041
-Grab hold of him.
-Mom!

09:51.125 --> 09:52.541
Hold him up!

09:52.625 --> 09:53.666
What's wrong, Dad?

09:53.750 --> 09:56.125
I can't do it on my own.
Someone give me a hand.

09:56.208 --> 09:59.500
-Don't worry. He's fine.
-He's not fine.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.250
Dad!

10:01.333 --> 10:03.125
What's happening?

10:03.208 --> 10:04.625
-Dad!
-Take his pulse.

10:04.708 --> 10:07.541
-Stop it, Dad.
-I don't know how to take someone's pulse.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.916
Thank you, my general.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.375
Murderer.

11:14.291 --> 11:15.666
Heil!

12:30.583 --> 12:32.375
NEW MARKETS
NON-GLOBAL CHILE

16:32.791 --> 16:34.000
Madam.

16:34.583 --> 16:35.708
Let me see.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.083
What did he eat yesterday?

16:46.625 --> 16:47.958
Same as today.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.541
Only vegetables, as usual.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.125
I don't get it.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.500
He says he wishes to die,
he stops drinking blood,

17:01.166 --> 17:03.000
and now he goes off to hunt?

17:04.125 --> 17:05.125
It is odd.

17:09.416 --> 17:10.791
I don't want Augusto to die.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.958
I'm at your service, madam.

17:16.833 --> 17:18.458
Salute me, then.

17:24.208 --> 17:27.208
Prepare yourself. My kids are coming.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.625
To steal from my general.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.000
To steal from me.

17:57.625 --> 17:58.750
Allow me.

18:47.333 --> 18:53.833
ARK

19:02.375 --> 19:06.250
You'd think Dad would slow down
in his old age, but apparently not.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.583
We don't know
who's hunting for those hearts.

19:08.666 --> 19:10.625
-We don't?
-No. Not at all.

19:11.791 --> 19:13.166
What do you know?

19:13.250 --> 19:14.416
The same as you.

19:15.041 --> 19:17.125
Hey. No one here is judging you.

19:17.208 --> 19:18.583
I'm not judging you either.

19:18.666 --> 19:23.041
We're too old to be so naive.
We're clearly all here for a reason.

19:23.125 --> 19:25.333
I came because I heard
they'd give us money.

19:25.416 --> 19:28.250
I just said that to get you here, stupid.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.916
-So they're not giving us anything?
-Please.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.708
Of course they'll give us money. Relax.

19:33.791 --> 19:36.583
They're not going to. Not one peso.

19:36.666 --> 19:38.416
We have to find it ourselves.

19:38.500 --> 19:42.750
That money's hidden
in papers, documents, and folders.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.666
People are freaked out over these murders.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.250
Well, who wouldn't be?

19:47.333 --> 19:49.791
Entire human hearts are being removed.

19:49.875 --> 19:50.958
It's bizarre.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.833
I hope they find him soon.

19:52.916 --> 19:54.375
-Who?
-The killer.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.250
-They should've found him by now.
-Who?

19:56.333 --> 19:57.250
The police.

19:57.333 --> 20:00.375
I just don't want them coming here.
That's all I ask.

20:01.041 --> 20:05.291
We shouldn't have to wait our whole lives
to get our inheritance.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.333
It's not that long.

20:06.416 --> 20:08.791
But some people do live longer
than they should.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.875
-You think so?
-I do.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.125
EXTRA CONCENTRATED
CHILI PEPPER

22:46.291 --> 22:47.458
Afternoon.

22:47.541 --> 22:49.083
Good afternoon, my general!

24:02.875 --> 24:06.250
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

24:06.333 --> 24:08.500
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

24:08.583 --> 24:11.375
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

24:11.458 --> 24:13.000
Blessed art thou among women,

24:13.083 --> 24:15.541
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.041
To what do I owe this delightful visit?

24:25.041 --> 24:26.666
We were worried, Dad.

24:27.541 --> 24:28.750
Sure you were.

24:29.250 --> 24:33.208
I've been on the verge of death before.
We've said our goodbyes many times.

24:33.291 --> 24:36.458
Dad, someone has been feasting
on hearts in Santiago.

24:37.416 --> 24:38.250
Someone?

24:39.708 --> 24:42.875
It could've been me…
but that wouldn't make much sense.

24:42.958 --> 24:46.375
Why would I want to keep on living
in a country where people hate me?

24:46.458 --> 24:47.875
They don't hate you.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.583
No.

24:49.666 --> 24:52.875
-Well, they should.
-They're so ungrateful.

24:53.958 --> 24:57.791
That is true. They are ungrateful.
It's a real pain in the ass.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.125
Though I'll admit,
I've made some mistakes.

25:05.666 --> 25:07.166
Mistakes with accounting.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.541
Oh, really?

25:12.208 --> 25:13.708
Well, you know.

25:13.791 --> 25:16.916
-Know what, Dad?
-No. Actually, we don't know anything.

25:18.041 --> 25:19.250
It's a real mess.

25:19.333 --> 25:22.875
Every day, your mom asks me
about secret bank accounts

25:22.958 --> 25:26.041
and real estate properties
around the world.

25:26.125 --> 25:30.083
I can't remember. None of it.
What can I do? I haven't a clue.

25:30.166 --> 25:33.666
And yet, the other day,
thinking it over, something came to me.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.208
What?

25:37.125 --> 25:40.166
I've got some old books in the basement.

25:40.250 --> 25:43.625
There, with the help of a lawyer
and a former minister,

25:43.708 --> 25:45.208
we hid some papers.

25:45.291 --> 25:49.125
I don't know.
Accounts, receipts, contracts.

25:49.666 --> 25:53.958
Who knows?
But they might be worth something.

26:09.291 --> 26:10.125
Dad?

26:11.958 --> 26:13.083
Why now, Dad?

26:13.166 --> 26:16.666
Well, I'd forgotten. But now I remember.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.541
I asked you a thousand times before.

26:19.625 --> 26:23.708
Well, I had forgotten until now,
which is why I am telling you.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.583
Why the long faces?

26:27.666 --> 26:29.250
You should be happy.

26:30.041 --> 26:33.958
If those papers are worth anything,
make sure you share them among yourselves.

26:35.166 --> 26:38.000
Give half to your mom,
and split the rest between you.

26:51.583 --> 26:54.166
And with that, I'll be off. I'm tired.

26:54.666 --> 26:56.125
I believe I will die tonight.

26:59.750 --> 27:03.416
Best of luck to all of you.
I love you very much.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.666
With all my heart. Truly.

27:16.583 --> 27:18.750
Permission to speak freely, my general.

27:21.708 --> 27:22.833
Go ahead.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.583
I love you, my general.

27:32.291 --> 27:33.500
Say something.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.500
I love you, Dad.

27:39.250 --> 27:40.666
-I love you.
-I love you.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.708
-I love you.
-I love you, Papi.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.083
Lucía?

27:47.875 --> 27:50.708
Don't make me say those things
in front of the children.

27:52.541 --> 27:53.958
I'm into you.

27:54.041 --> 27:57.750
You turn me on.
You drive me wild… you old minx.

28:01.333 --> 28:04.958
Will you show me the cannons
before you die?

28:05.041 --> 28:08.166
Make me sweat like you used to?

28:10.458 --> 28:13.041
I'll ride you like a bandit's horse.

31:31.625 --> 31:34.250
Was it you who went out hunting?

31:35.041 --> 31:36.125
No, madam.

31:36.208 --> 31:37.750
I don't need to.

32:07.833 --> 32:09.750
The papers.

32:10.791 --> 32:11.791
Madam?

32:12.833 --> 32:14.166
The money.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Excuse me.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.541
Why can't I seem to die?

33:18.375 --> 33:21.125
-Because you don't want to.
-Of course I do.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.708
I've been alive for 250 years.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.625
But we could live 250 more.

33:25.708 --> 33:29.208
I don't want to live another 250 years.
Good heavens.

33:29.291 --> 33:30.500
Why not?

33:31.125 --> 33:33.000
They said I was a thief.

33:33.791 --> 33:37.916
You can call a soldier a killer,
or whatever else, but not a thief.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.541
I killed hundreds of Reds.
Hundreds of them.

33:41.458 --> 33:44.125
But, for the rest of my life,
they'll say I'm a thief.

33:44.208 --> 33:46.250
They humiliated me. They…

33:47.041 --> 33:47.958
They did.

33:48.041 --> 33:50.416
But you did steal, didn't you?

33:52.750 --> 33:56.125
How about this? You… bite me.

33:57.250 --> 33:58.958
And we'll go out hunting at night.

33:59.666 --> 34:00.833
Just for blood.

34:00.916 --> 34:02.416
Then we'll go

34:03.458 --> 34:06.000
to the basement,
where you keep the hearts.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.291
We'll eat them.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.250
And we'll be young again.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.750
Then we'll go to another country,

34:13.625 --> 34:14.958
with new names.

34:15.625 --> 34:17.291
As fifteen-year-olds.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.875
With another army.

34:20.958 --> 34:24.000
But I just don't understand
why I can't manage to die.

34:27.875 --> 34:30.208
You're putting blood in my food.

34:30.708 --> 34:34.166
You're putting blood
in my food to keep me alive.

34:34.666 --> 34:36.083
-Aren't you?
-No.

34:38.708 --> 34:42.291
"President Allende,
the army won't betray you!"

34:42.791 --> 34:43.666
What?

34:44.375 --> 34:46.000
That's what I said to him.

34:47.125 --> 34:50.208
And then what…?
I betrayed him the very next day.

34:51.291 --> 34:52.333
It was my idea.

34:52.416 --> 34:54.208
Yes, but no one knows that.

34:55.041 --> 34:57.166
It was an old vendetta of mine.

34:59.083 --> 35:01.458
I was on a mission. A mission to crush.

35:01.958 --> 35:03.958
To crush the anarchists.

35:04.041 --> 35:08.916
To crush the trade unionists,
the Republicans, and the freed slaves.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.708
But then you fell in love with me.

35:10.791 --> 35:12.458
We've been together for 60 years.

35:12.541 --> 35:16.541
What more do you want?
You've had it all. Kids, grandkids…

35:16.625 --> 35:18.750
You've been the queen of this desert.

35:18.833 --> 35:21.250
What is there to complain about?

35:21.333 --> 35:26.166
We have brandy every night.
We talk. We sleep holding hands.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.333
What else do you want?

35:28.416 --> 35:30.041
To become a monster like you.

35:37.541 --> 35:40.166
No. There has to be more than this.

35:40.250 --> 35:41.291
Papers in English.

35:41.375 --> 35:45.083
Bank letters, bonds,
cashier's checks, bearer documents…

35:45.166 --> 35:46.583
Things like that.

35:47.375 --> 35:48.625
What about this?

35:49.958 --> 35:50.958
Let me see.

35:53.166 --> 35:54.291
Stuff like this.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.708
Is your friend coming?

35:59.791 --> 36:01.958
-She's not my friend.
-Who's coming?

36:02.041 --> 36:04.375
-Did you tell that accountant of yours?
-I did.

36:04.458 --> 36:06.708
He can't come. He's sending his assistant.

36:06.791 --> 36:07.916
Now?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.208
-It's what we agreed.
-I didn't.

36:10.791 --> 36:13.416
-Can we trust her?
-Sure. She's from a military family.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.083
-But she's a woman.
-Yes.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.333
Excuse me.

36:17.625 --> 36:18.750
Is she young?

36:19.583 --> 36:22.291
-Yeah.
-Who cares?

36:22.875 --> 36:26.500
As long as she understands this
and doesn't talk to the press, she'll do.

36:26.583 --> 36:27.958
Do we have to pay her?

36:28.041 --> 36:31.291
Of course. And handsomely,
so she won't become a liability.

36:31.375 --> 36:32.708
Is this all there is?

36:33.416 --> 36:35.666
I'll need to check with my general.

36:36.291 --> 36:37.666
But I would say no.

36:39.125 --> 36:40.500
We're rich, then.

36:41.291 --> 36:42.500
We certainly are.

37:51.125 --> 37:52.750
-Merci.
-May I?

37:53.250 --> 37:54.500
Thank you.

38:08.625 --> 38:09.916
Good morning.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.958
Hello. Finally.

38:12.583 --> 38:13.708
Dad!

38:13.791 --> 38:14.833
What?

38:14.916 --> 38:17.291
This is the accountant
who's going to help us.

38:18.125 --> 38:19.625
What's her name?

38:20.208 --> 38:21.208
Carmen.

38:26.333 --> 38:27.708
Carmencita.

38:29.041 --> 38:33.208
I'm here to count your silver coins
and weigh your gold.

38:33.291 --> 38:34.541
Discreetly, of course.

38:35.916 --> 38:37.750
That would be wonderful.

38:37.833 --> 38:41.375
But I'm afraid I don't have much left.
I'm poor.

38:41.875 --> 38:45.500
In that case, I'll find money
you didn't even know you had.

38:45.583 --> 38:47.666
-Is that French?
-Well, yeah.

38:47.750 --> 38:50.500
Please forgive my…
Do you understand my childlike French?

38:50.583 --> 38:53.083
It seems I'm forgetting
the language of my Sun King.

38:54.333 --> 38:58.833
This language of treason and war
can never be forgotten.

39:00.666 --> 39:01.750
Perhaps.

39:01.833 --> 39:05.333
The New Testament says that God
only understands the French language.

39:05.416 --> 39:07.000
And if I remember correctly,

39:07.750 --> 39:11.666
it says that God listens with love
to those who whisper in His ear in French.

39:13.958 --> 39:17.750
God is in love with the beauty
that He himself has envisioned.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.500
He's a vain artist.

39:21.083 --> 39:26.125
An artist who created women…
to be perfect.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.375
Beautifully said.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.208
Yes.

39:32.791 --> 39:34.333
Very beautiful, indeed.

39:57.125 --> 39:59.041
-Thank you.
-But of course.

40:00.291 --> 40:01.541
Make yourself at home.

40:06.125 --> 40:07.083
Excuse me.

40:46.958 --> 40:48.583
It must be a case of possession.

40:48.666 --> 40:50.958
Like permanently carrying

40:51.041 --> 40:53.000
-the enemy of our Lord.
-Right, but…

40:53.083 --> 40:55.583
You think the devil got inside his body?

40:55.666 --> 40:57.500
-Yes. He did.
-How?

40:57.583 --> 40:59.875
Sometimes he finds a way in
through a wound.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.625
This happens to soldiers
on the battlefield.

41:02.708 --> 41:05.375
Other times, he finds his way
through the anus,

41:05.458 --> 41:07.666
when a man performs acts of sodomy.

41:07.750 --> 41:08.958
Watch your mouth.

41:09.708 --> 41:13.041
My father was always a patriotic soldier.

41:13.125 --> 41:16.791
Of course. It must have happened
through a combat wound.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.416
-Right.
-Of course.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.416
Hey.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.458
What if he was born this way?

41:24.125 --> 41:28.291
Maybe he's one of those animals…

41:29.375 --> 41:30.625
An animal from hell?

41:30.708 --> 41:32.916
Sure. Like a man without a soul. A dog.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.708
Beasts do live among us.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.250
Creatures of the devil with no soul.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.875
Nothing but black smoke
inside their chests.

41:39.958 --> 41:43.166
They can't be saved.
All you can do is kill them.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.125
I don't want my father to suffer.

41:45.208 --> 41:47.333
Honestly, it'll be a fierce battle.

41:47.416 --> 41:50.458
Satan may be pathetic
and melodramatic, but he is tireless.

41:50.541 --> 41:53.625
If I run out of strength, he may kill me.

41:53.708 --> 41:55.041
I couldn't care less.

41:55.125 --> 41:56.416
-Oh.
-I'm kidding.

41:57.541 --> 41:59.041
-Honey?
-Yes?

41:59.125 --> 42:02.125
Treat my father with care.

42:02.208 --> 42:05.875
Violence is the way of the devil.
God's love will suffocate him.

42:05.958 --> 42:08.083
The holy water will burn him.

42:08.166 --> 42:12.000
Once the invader retreats,
your father will be at death's door.

42:12.083 --> 42:13.666
He will be bedridden.

42:13.750 --> 42:16.750
If he survives,
it will mean he's always had a soul.

42:16.833 --> 42:19.083
Even if there's only
a bit of good soul in there,

42:19.166 --> 42:21.500
that soul belongs to the Holy Spirit.

42:22.458 --> 42:23.625
And I will save it.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.500
This document mentions 12 apartments.

43:13.583 --> 43:16.583
Investments like these
that generate income without work

43:16.666 --> 43:18.791
are common in families unwilling to work.

43:19.791 --> 43:21.666
There should be 14.

43:21.750 --> 43:22.875
Fourteen.

43:22.958 --> 43:25.416
-There are no records of that here.
-What?

43:26.333 --> 43:27.833
How can properties go missing?

43:27.916 --> 43:31.333
Come on. No big deal.
12, 14. It's all the same.

43:31.416 --> 43:34.000
No, we have to clear this up.

43:34.083 --> 43:36.083
We're talking about my money here.

43:36.166 --> 43:38.000
-Your money?
-Yeah, my money.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.416
Quiet. Let her work in peace.

43:41.666 --> 43:42.958
Am I bothering you?

43:43.458 --> 43:45.916
No. Nothing bothers me.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.500
I love seeing
this kind of jealousy and violence.

43:48.583 --> 43:53.625
Irrational behavior like this
will lead you to betray one another.

43:53.708 --> 43:55.666
My strategy is to sow confusion.

43:55.750 --> 43:59.083
Because accusations and betrayal
are bound to follow.

43:59.166 --> 44:00.416
So I'm not bothering you?

44:00.500 --> 44:03.500
-Uh-uh.
-You're bothering me. I'm trying to work.

44:03.583 --> 44:05.750
What's this CEMA Chile?

44:05.833 --> 44:08.250
Center for Chilean Mothers.
It's right there.

44:08.958 --> 44:09.791
ESTATE SUMMARY

44:09.875 --> 44:12.625
You diverted money
from the Army's Command Headquarters,

44:12.708 --> 44:16.833
which came from the sale of weapons
and gear, to CEMA Chile, correct?

44:17.708 --> 44:18.708
Mom?

44:20.250 --> 44:22.833
There are no accounting documents.

44:22.916 --> 44:26.416
It says here the president of CEMA
was the First Lady. That means you.

44:27.208 --> 44:30.458
Reserve funds were also transferred
from embassy attaché offices,

44:30.541 --> 44:32.500
from the Military Chiefs to CEMA Chile.

44:33.750 --> 44:37.500
Just as well all this information
has come to light, huh?

44:37.583 --> 44:38.916
I don't get it.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.500
Are we discussing
your inheritance here, Mom?

44:41.583 --> 44:44.375
-I'm not dead yet, dear.
-No, but goddammit.

44:44.458 --> 44:47.125
It's just layer after layer of lies, Mom.

44:47.208 --> 44:50.291
Well, those lies
are about to make you a millionaire.

44:50.375 --> 44:52.958
If he's going to die, we gotta fix this.

44:54.583 --> 44:57.208
I don't know what you're fighting over.

44:57.791 --> 45:01.208
I'll transfer everything we find
to you immediately.

45:01.291 --> 45:04.000
-Like the winter home.
-What winter home?

45:04.083 --> 45:06.208
-In La Parva?
-No, Aspen.

45:06.708 --> 45:08.208
United States?

45:08.291 --> 45:13.250
No way. Dad gave me that house
because none of you ever cared for skiing.

45:13.750 --> 45:17.250
-I'd like to learn.
-Dad, weren't we splitting things evenly?

45:17.333 --> 45:19.708
He gave this to me,
and no one else but me.

45:20.750 --> 45:22.833
I can't stand injustice.

45:32.875 --> 45:35.125
I was looking over your case.

45:35.208 --> 45:37.833
After reviewing that filthy slander…

45:37.916 --> 45:41.916
It says you ordered the disappearance
and murder of thousands of Chileans.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.208
-Me?
-Yes.

45:43.291 --> 45:46.750
There is also evidence against you
regarding secret documents.

45:46.833 --> 45:48.000
Ill-gotten money.

45:48.083 --> 45:52.875
Because of this, I believe
that you have assets hidden from the law.

45:52.958 --> 45:57.166
Yes. That's why I had to die.
They wanted to meddle in everything.

45:57.250 --> 45:59.916
Sure. But you didn't die
when they say you did.

46:00.500 --> 46:05.291
Even now, I can see you're breathing
as healthy as an ox in spring.

46:06.291 --> 46:07.875
-Oh, yeah?
-Yes.

46:07.958 --> 46:09.000
How about that.

46:09.083 --> 46:13.333
Could you tell me
where we might find these secret accounts?

46:13.416 --> 46:17.416
Certainly. I had to withdraw the money
because my kids don't know how to work.

46:17.500 --> 46:20.416
-I don't want them to starve to death.
-Of course.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.625
-But don't take me for a thief.
-Not at all.

46:23.208 --> 46:27.375
Thieves steal what isn't theirs,
while you use your power to get rich.

46:27.458 --> 46:29.666
-Exactly.
-Which is the only way.

46:29.750 --> 46:32.083
I was a taciturn general.

46:32.166 --> 46:33.708
An intellectual.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.583
Until someone convinced me

46:35.666 --> 46:40.958
I had to stage a coup to overthrow
Allende's Marxist-Leninist regime.

46:41.041 --> 46:42.250
After that,

46:42.333 --> 46:46.541
I was surrounded by refined gentlemen
who smelled of cologne.

46:46.625 --> 46:51.500
One very refined man came along
and offered me money.

46:52.541 --> 46:54.958
I had no idea what to do.
He said, "Don't worry."

46:55.041 --> 46:57.833
"I'll open a bank account
for you in the Caribbean."

46:57.916 --> 46:59.833
So I said, "Fine."

46:59.916 --> 47:02.416
Not long after, he asked for a favor.

47:02.500 --> 47:06.416
He wanted to purchase
state-owned companies for peanuts.

47:06.500 --> 47:11.708
That's when I realized
this man was blackmailing me.

47:11.791 --> 47:14.833
After that, people came
from all over to talk to me.

47:14.916 --> 47:18.750
They offered me the world.
Long story short, I became rich.

47:19.958 --> 47:25.541
So rich that Lucía got a chandelier
to go over the bathtub.

47:25.625 --> 47:30.708
I also became famous worldwide
for defeating Communism.

47:30.791 --> 47:34.958
It's a shame you fell victim
to such despicable manipulation.

47:35.458 --> 47:39.416
And that you unknowingly
became involved in influence peddling.

47:40.041 --> 47:43.708
Inadvertently receiving payoffs
from soulless businessmen.

47:43.791 --> 47:47.791
Yes, I really have been
a victim in all this.

47:47.875 --> 47:51.708
Though that's hard to believe
since you are a captain general.

47:51.791 --> 47:55.208
A hero who's supposed to be smarter
than those businessmen.

47:55.291 --> 47:56.291
Of course.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.166
Have you ever considered donating
your fortune to church-run charities?

48:01.666 --> 48:05.125
If I did that, my children would kill me.

48:05.625 --> 48:08.250
But isn't that what you want?
To be killed?

48:08.750 --> 48:12.125
Well, yes, but now…

48:13.708 --> 48:17.833
I've decided it would be nice
to start a new life.

48:18.791 --> 48:22.958
Well, if you really want
to repeat that same horror again,

48:23.041 --> 48:25.875
we better find that lost fortune
in these papers.

48:25.958 --> 48:27.875
Fair point.

48:29.250 --> 48:33.458
I ask personal questions
because they're necessary for my work.

48:33.541 --> 48:37.583
But I'm also a curious person
and like to lay things bare with my voice.

48:37.666 --> 48:40.416
That's great. Wonderful.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.208
What are you planning
to destroy in your new life?

48:44.458 --> 48:46.958
The International Court in The Hague.

48:48.041 --> 48:50.166
And then… I'm not sure.

48:50.708 --> 48:55.791
I haven't given it much thought.
I've only now decided to keep on living.

49:00.666 --> 49:02.583
I hope I've inspired you with my presence.

49:02.666 --> 49:03.625
You have.

49:06.208 --> 49:10.875
Men of sin have told me that my body
has something that invites second chances.

49:10.958 --> 49:12.583
-What's that?
-I'm not sure.

49:13.416 --> 49:15.750
Maybe it's because I smell
of bird of paradise flowers.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.250
It could also be a new hormone
that changes the aroma of my sweat.

49:22.666 --> 49:23.833
Well, I don't…

49:24.916 --> 49:27.833
I can't quite smell your scent.

49:53.750 --> 49:55.541
Is Dad not coming down for lunch?

52:07.000 --> 52:08.125
Are you coming in?

52:09.208 --> 52:10.958
Of course I am.

54:22.666 --> 54:26.083
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

54:26.166 --> 54:27.500
Thy kingdom come.

54:27.583 --> 54:30.000
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

54:30.083 --> 54:31.750
Give us this day our daily bread.

54:31.833 --> 54:33.208
And forgive us our trespasses

54:33.291 --> 54:35.250
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

54:35.333 --> 54:39.125
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

54:39.208 --> 54:42.250
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.500
Thy kingdom come…

54:59.750 --> 55:00.791
Hail Mary…

55:08.500 --> 55:10.541
Don't go hunting, my general.

55:20.541 --> 55:21.583
Why not?

55:22.083 --> 55:26.000
Don't make me waste my time.
I'm helping you die.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.833
Make no mistake.
I'm not pleased with your services.

55:29.916 --> 55:32.791
Killing Reds? Anyone can do that.

55:32.875 --> 55:34.125
No, not just anyone.

55:34.625 --> 55:38.291
I taught my soldiers to kill for pleasure.

55:38.791 --> 55:41.125
And frying women's breasts
with electricity,

55:41.208 --> 55:43.125
did you do that for pleasure too?

55:43.625 --> 55:45.166
I did it with love, even.

55:45.250 --> 55:47.333
Pleasure…

55:49.000 --> 55:52.708
When I finally bit you,
you dropped your pants.

55:52.791 --> 55:54.291
Why was that?

55:54.375 --> 55:56.208
Don't go hunting, my general.

55:56.833 --> 55:59.000
That woman, the accountant, is a nun.

55:59.875 --> 56:02.625
She wants to cast the devil out of me.

56:02.708 --> 56:03.916
But I…

56:04.666 --> 56:06.291
I've got nothing inside.

56:09.291 --> 56:10.416
Me neither.

56:11.666 --> 56:13.458
We're two beasts of the night.

56:13.541 --> 56:16.291
And the night is made
for thieves like you.

56:17.166 --> 56:19.083
I liked killing.

56:19.166 --> 56:20.958
You liked stealing.

56:21.458 --> 56:23.416
No, I liked the killing too.

56:24.458 --> 56:28.333
But I can't live like a peasant, Fyodor.

56:28.416 --> 56:33.041
I need something to build on.
Something solid.

56:33.125 --> 56:36.541
I need people to help me.
Servants like you.

56:36.625 --> 56:38.833
I cannot bear to wash dirty sheets.

56:40.791 --> 56:42.541
What dirty sheets?

56:43.583 --> 56:46.291
The ones you and Lucía will soil.

56:48.125 --> 56:49.708
But I've never touched her.

56:51.375 --> 56:52.500
You haven't yet?

56:53.375 --> 56:54.375
No.

56:54.458 --> 56:56.625
Well, go ahead and touch her.

56:56.708 --> 57:00.208
But go easy on those howls of pleasure.

57:01.208 --> 57:03.291
They're way too feminine.

57:04.750 --> 57:07.708
You may keep my wife.
She's my gift to you.

57:08.500 --> 57:10.416
Do with her what you will.

57:10.916 --> 57:13.708
But the money is mine.

58:25.666 --> 58:27.333
May I take your picture?

58:37.458 --> 58:41.083
You and your siblings were sent to jail
in 2007 for embezzlement--

58:41.166 --> 58:42.875
We were political prisoners.

58:43.375 --> 58:46.083
Of course.
But you were also accused of hitting--

58:46.166 --> 58:48.083
How will you perform this exorcism?

58:50.083 --> 58:51.208
With God's love.

58:51.291 --> 58:53.208
And if you can't get the demon out?

58:53.291 --> 58:56.083
-That's up to the Holy Spirit.
-Screw the Holy Spirit.

58:56.166 --> 58:59.333
What's your plan
if you can't get the devil out of him?

58:59.416 --> 59:01.125
I can kill him with a plastic bag.

59:01.208 --> 59:03.416
-How's that?
-I'll put it over his head.

59:03.500 --> 59:04.416
Suffocate him.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.208
-Then I'll cut--
-And his genitals?

59:06.291 --> 59:08.750
-That won't be necessary.
-Cut it all off.

59:08.833 --> 59:13.458
Did you know about the secret papers,
cashier's checks, and bearer bonds?

59:13.541 --> 59:15.000
-Is that a yes?
-Yes.

59:15.083 --> 59:17.083
Why didn't you look for them earlier,

59:17.166 --> 59:20.416
during all these years your father's been…
a walking corpse?

59:21.458 --> 59:25.000
Like you said, we were under investigation
by those leftist judges.

59:25.500 --> 59:28.208
It wasn't wise to come looking
for undeclared money.

59:28.875 --> 59:32.625
Anyway, my mother figured out a way
to continue receiving donations.

59:33.250 --> 59:35.958
And some of those donations
made their way to us.

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:12.291
After the attack
on the World Trade Center in 2001,

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:15.875
the US Senate forced
several financial institutions

01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:20.458
to lift bank secrecy to investigate
how terrorism was being financed.

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:21.916
Damn gringos.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.958
They just so happened
to look into your family

01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.708
and your accounts under false names.

01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:30.750
Then they put Osama bin Laden's photo
right next to your father's.

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:35.291
-How many accounts are we talking?
-In the US, 125, give or take.

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:36.208
Give or take?

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:39.250
The ones the judge found.
But he didn't dig deep enough.

01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:44.000
He didn't see the ones in Germany,
the Bahamas, or Gibraltar, for example.

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:47.166
Your father went by several aliases,
including Daniel López,

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.166
to hide his illicit activities.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.583
Why did he choose
such a run-of-the-mill name?

01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:53.458
It's not a criminal alias. No!

01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:56.416
It's not exactly a stage name.
It's a nom de guerre.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.416
To wage war on the laws that protect
the country from financial crimes.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.708
He used it to make--

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:06.291
To generate an income comparable
to the fortunes

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:09.208
of the hundreds of businessmen
he helped make millionaires.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:13.416
So he created a mediocre illegal alias
to fulfill an entirely noble goal?

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:18.291
Well, it may be an illegal act according
to the laws of this ungrateful country,

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:21.500
but a blessed act
in the eyes of divine justice.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.500
You see, our dad is a martial arts expert
and can hold his breath for ten minutes.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.583
-Or more.
-More?

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.125
His pulse too.

01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:50.208
So, on our mom's birthday,
when he had that episode,

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:55.000
the doctors went into his room,
checked his vitals, and declared him dead.

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:58.291
Could he do the same thing again?

01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:01.541
No. Because now he actually wants to die.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.625
Maybe the name came
from some distant relative.

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:17.750
Or perhaps, back in the '80s,
the captain general

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:23.291
killed a Daniel López, burned his body,
and threw him into the sea from a chopper.

01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:26.875
-My dad could never kill anyone.
-Of course not.

01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:30.250
His subordinates committed
those heinous acts of violence.

01:02:30.333 --> 01:02:33.291
I'm talking about
your father's mysterious sense of humor.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:37.791
It's possible the captain general
used the name of a missing detainee

01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:40.583
to defraud, to make a cruel joke

01:02:40.666 --> 01:02:44.208
that only Daniel López's
real killers would understand.

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:47.708
That's impossible.
My dad hasn't got a sense of humor.

01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:05.500
-I love him.
-I know.

01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:09.375
Do you believe in God and all that?

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:13.416
-Yes. In all that.
-I went to a traditional Catholic school.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.166
When Franco died,
three of the nuns committed suicide.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:20.250
Why does God allow the devil to live on?
He could've killed him by now, right?

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:22.958
A sublime mystery,
but we put our faith in the Lord.

01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:26.333
We tell him that we are content
not knowing his reasons

01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:29.791
because one day we'll reside
in the bristly bosom of his desires.

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:31.458
-Do you understand?
-Of course.

01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:34.541
But what if the devil is inside me?

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:37.333
I like whiskey, men,
cars, and expensive sneakers.

01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:40.000
Is that the devil?

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.833
That is definitely Satan calling.

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:43.708
And what does God have to offer?

01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:45.458
Pure, true love.

01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:48.833
My dream… is to one day
look upon the face of my eternal God.

01:03:49.875 --> 01:03:51.333
For fuck's sake.

01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:55.375
I bet God sends us to this world
to see if we're tempted by the devil.

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:59.250
And I was tempted.
I did things… Lust, that's my problem.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.666
I'm nasty.

01:04:01.208 --> 01:04:02.625
Nasty nasty.

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:06.291
Sorry.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.333
No, don't be.

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:09.458
I agree with you.

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:12.333
In fact, I came
into this world to meet the devil.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:13.916
To live with him.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.208
To love him.

01:04:15.291 --> 01:04:16.833
To be tempted.

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:20.000
So he would touch me.
So I could touch him.

01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:22.208
So I could humiliate him.

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:24.125
So he could see me work.

01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:45.166
You do know your sister
told me everything?

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.458
What did she tell you?

01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:51.000
Your sister called me to come save
your father's heavy and seething soul.

01:04:51.083 --> 01:04:52.041
His invaded soul.

01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:57.291
That's exactly what
we've been praying for, for so long.

01:04:57.375 --> 01:05:00.750
All generals who win wars
have the right to pillage

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:02.666
and make a fortune.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.041
Of course.

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:07.333
And it is very sad to see
that their heirs, such as you,

01:05:07.416 --> 01:05:09.500
cannot share in the honor of their glory.

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.416
The undefeated Chilean army

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.000
allowed your father
to use it to launder money?

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.208
If you think so, it could be true.

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:32.083
But look, years ago, I bought
a steel company from the army.

01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:34.208
Pretty cheap. Really cheap.

01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:36.041
Because it was bankrupt.

01:05:36.125 --> 01:05:37.791
And a couple of years later,

01:05:37.875 --> 01:05:41.958
I sold that company back to the army
for three million dollars.

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:45.833
That comes out to be…
How much? Like 1,000% profit.

01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:49.291
I don't know the exact percentage.
I've never been good at math.

01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:51.208
You saved the company?

01:05:51.291 --> 01:05:53.958
No, it was still bankrupt.
I didn't do anything.

01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:58.208
So, the Chilean army
bought a broke steel company

01:05:58.291 --> 01:06:00.125
using your father's checks?

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:01.333
Yup.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:06.083
Then you deposited those three checks,
for a total sum of three million dollars,

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:09.708
into secret bank accounts
in Washington, under false names.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:11.750
Yup.

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:14.041
-Yup.
-But it was all under the radar.

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:16.500
When it came to light,
we weren't investigated.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:19.041
We continued on with our lives as usual.

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:21.208
-Happy and free.
-Excuse me, sir.

01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:25.916
You're free because your father threatened
a new coup if you were investigated.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.416
Yes, but all Christian Democrats back then
were in agreement.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.291
And it really worked.

01:06:31.791 --> 01:06:35.291
Three million dollars in personal checks.
Three million.

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:36.958
It sounds like a lot,

01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:39.541
but in the grand scheme of things,
it's really not.

01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:43.458
Compare it to Fulgencio Batista
or Ferdinand Marcos.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:46.291
Next to those guys,
our fortune's a pittance.

01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:49.375
Now, they were corrupt. And murderers too.

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.166
Your simplemindedness is fascinating.

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:54.375
"My father stole less
than this other thief."

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:56.250
Only a villain can say that.

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:59.041
An empty husk
who doesn't believe in humanity.

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.250
Thank you.

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:06.291
Are there more documents
hidden in this house?

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:07.291
No.

01:07:08.875 --> 01:07:12.208
How did they get here in the first place?
Do you recall?

01:07:12.291 --> 01:07:15.875
They were brought in by helicopter.
Only I wasn't here.

01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:18.875
And you hid them in the basement?

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:20.250
Perhaps.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.875
Having to drink blood to survive.

01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:31.541
-It must be a dreadful sacrifice.
-Dreadful.

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:35.166
Imagine the humiliation
of having to hide all that money

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:37.250
to sustain a never-ending life.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:38.875
But where is the money?

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:41.375
I'm figuring it all out. But tell me.

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:43.375
-Are there accounts in Panama?
-Yes.

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:44.708
-Okay.
-Six of them.

01:07:46.958 --> 01:07:48.041
Seven.

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:51.958
Can you wire money
from those accounts now?

01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:53.416
No, I can't.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.458
We bought antique books,
collector's items.

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:01.791
My dad was into that sort of thing.

01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:04.625
-You know what I mean?
-No, I don't.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:10.250
My dad accumulated a ton of junk.

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:12.250
Napoleon's hat.

01:08:12.333 --> 01:08:14.500
A sword owned by O'Higgins.

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:18.750
And a dress that belonged
to some queen they had in France.

01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:35.125
One last question.

01:08:35.208 --> 01:08:36.958
That butler…

01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:38.833
He drinks blood too.

01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:40.416
He's a white Russian.

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:42.958
He killed thousands of Bolsheviks.

01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:44.916
The ones in this country, of course.

01:08:46.208 --> 01:08:49.541
Payback for the Russian Revolution
that sent his family into exile.

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:52.291
Here, he trained torturers.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:55.083
My dad bit him on the leg
to thank him for his service

01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:56.583
and give him eternal life.

01:08:57.958 --> 01:09:01.458
But you do realize
that butler is a brutish fellow.

01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:04.083
He's only got one testicle.
Just like Hitler.

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.791
And he can't eat normal food.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.125
If he doesn't eat meat,
he eats human feces.

01:09:08.708 --> 01:09:10.625
Or animal feces.

01:09:10.708 --> 01:09:13.416
That's why he licks
the anuses of sheepdogs.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.833
Haven't you seen him?

01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:16.791
No.

01:09:17.791 --> 01:09:18.916
Not yet.

01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:23.541
You've been accused of killing
over 300 political prisoners.

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.916
-You must be proud.
-I am completely innocent.

01:09:27.583 --> 01:09:30.708
You were sentenced to 865 years in prison.

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:33.208
I'm not sure how you can be here.

01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:36.875
There's someone else
with your name and likeness

01:09:36.958 --> 01:09:39.666
who is in prison, serving your sentence.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:41.625
I only happen to be me.

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:49.791
The Chilean army
taught me torture as a principle.

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:53.875
I simply followed
the instructions I was given

01:09:53.958 --> 01:09:55.791
when I was trained as a soldier

01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:58.416
by teachers paid
by the Chilean State.

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.375
I know what you're feeling.

01:10:06.708 --> 01:10:07.541
What?

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:12.875
When torturing, the promise of pain
is much more powerful than actual pain.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:18.208
Because during that agonizing wait,
the imagination runs wild.

01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:21.458
What are you going to do to me?

01:10:21.541 --> 01:10:23.625
Stick something cold in you.

01:13:43.666 --> 01:13:45.416
He won't bite me.

01:13:47.166 --> 01:13:49.666
He won't bite me.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.125
He went out hunting for hearts that night.

01:13:56.208 --> 01:13:57.708
-It was me.
-No.

01:13:57.791 --> 01:14:00.125
It was me who went out
hunting for hearts that night.

01:14:00.208 --> 01:14:03.500
It was him.
He dressed as the captain general.

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:07.125
That was me. I wore his uniform. Me.

01:14:25.208 --> 01:14:27.916
I did it to scare your children
into coming here.

01:14:28.666 --> 01:14:30.750
-To do what?
-Kill him.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.875
My general wants to die, but he cannot.

01:14:34.791 --> 01:14:35.958
Why not?

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:40.708
Someone doesn't want him to die.

01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:43.958
Who?

01:14:44.041 --> 01:14:46.750
I don't know… who.

01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:52.416
You want my children to kill the general
since you can't do it yourself.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.916
I can't kill him. He bit me.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.875
You want to keep his fortune
and steal his woman?

01:14:58.375 --> 01:14:59.708
Who is his woman?

01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:01.041
I am.

01:15:01.666 --> 01:15:02.791
It's me.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:08.166
Not anymore. It appears he's in love
with a young French accountant.

01:15:09.541 --> 01:15:12.083
My general is fond of fine horses.

01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:15.208
Excuse me.

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:47.333
I adjure you, Satan, prince of this world,

01:16:47.416 --> 01:16:50.375
acknowledge the power
and might of Jesus Christ.

01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:52.791
He who defeated you in the desert,

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:56.166
vanquished you in the garden,
robbed you on the cross.

01:16:56.250 --> 01:17:00.500
And by rising from the tomb, bore off
your prize to the kingdom of light.

01:17:10.166 --> 01:17:14.208
I order you, Satan, deceiver of mankind,

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:18.291
to leave this creature of God,
whom you have left an evil seal on.

01:17:18.833 --> 01:17:24.416
Leave this man whom God
has anointed to be a holy temple.

01:18:13.666 --> 01:18:15.250
FINAL REPORT
PINOCHET FAMILY

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:20.541
Me.

01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:05.000
With these documents and this money,
the Church could extort the Chilean army,

01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:06.583
the Chilean government,

01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:11.958
and also the businessmen who nobly
donated their money, jewelry, and cash

01:24:12.041 --> 01:24:13.916
to help Mom.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.958
But Carmen is just a child.

01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:17.583
A brat.

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:20.041
She has a perfect mind.

01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:21.958
Beautiful and criminal.

01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:25.125
She's better than I.

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:26.791
She came to steal.

01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:28.750
That bitch.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.666
-Bitch.
-I told her everything.

01:24:32.416 --> 01:24:35.375
She's going to steal it. All of it.

01:24:35.458 --> 01:24:36.916
That's not what he's saying.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.541
-She's going to blackmail us.
-No, you idiot.

01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:41.708
She'll steal from us. Humiliate us.

01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:43.500
She'll blackmail the rest.

01:24:43.583 --> 01:24:46.458
-Was that the only copy?
-We'll have to check her room.

01:24:46.541 --> 01:24:48.750
And the money? Where is the money?

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:50.375
Did anyone check her suitcase?

01:24:50.458 --> 01:24:52.708
-I don't get it.
-She's going to kill him.

01:24:52.791 --> 01:24:55.166
-The nun.
-And they'll blame me.

01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.166
She brought stakes and silver hammers.

01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:59.458
-Plus holy water and some weird crap.
-What?

01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:01.666
She brought stakes and silver hammers.

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:03.833
-Are you deaf?
-She won't kill me.

01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:05.375
She won't.

01:25:05.458 --> 01:25:08.000
I was tricked once.
I won't let it happen again.

01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:11.333
-And Mom? Where is she?
-Off with Fyodor.

01:25:11.833 --> 01:25:15.708
She won't kill me either.
I won't let that little brat kill me.

01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:18.375
You have to kill her.

01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:20.875
I can't. My general would kill me first.

01:25:21.375 --> 01:25:23.625
You're more loyal to him than to me?

01:25:23.708 --> 01:25:24.833
Let me bite you.

01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:27.625
-No.
-Now. Let me bite you now.

01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:29.583
I am the queen here.

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:31.750
Stop fooling around.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.708
I am a foreigner to this century.

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.375
And to you, I am eternal life.

01:25:41.208 --> 01:25:44.916
If you're going to bite me,
I want you to kill the general first.

01:25:50.208 --> 01:25:51.208
Excuse me.

01:25:55.333 --> 01:25:57.333
I want you to win a war for me--

01:25:58.958 --> 01:25:59.875
What?

01:26:00.625 --> 01:26:02.583
Let me… go!

01:26:30.458 --> 01:26:31.708
Margaret?

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:40.333
I don't know. I haven't a clue.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.375
I just met her. We're going on vacation.

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:50.416
It's nice to see you.
I thought you were dead.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:53.625
But I see there are still
ancient people around, like me.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.500
Because… she's my sweetheart.

01:30:34.125 --> 01:30:35.000
No.

01:31:01.375 --> 01:31:03.791
You goddamn old tramp.

01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:06.916
I always knew you were after my husband.

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:15.916
You bit her?

01:31:16.583 --> 01:31:20.416
You only just met this thief,
and you bit her?

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.958
Don't be a nag. You reek of Fyodor.

01:31:23.041 --> 01:31:25.166
I can smell him
from all the way over here.

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:26.166
Traitor.

01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:28.333
So Mom's never going to die either?

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.958
And now Carmencita.

01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:32.500
We're screwed. We have nothing.

01:31:32.583 --> 01:31:33.708
What?

01:31:33.791 --> 01:31:36.375
If Dad doesn't die,
we'll never get anything.

01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:37.916
And if they kill each other?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.208
-Why would they do that?
-Over the money?

01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:43.000
No. They love and hate each other.
They're a different species.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:46.208
Why don't we kill them?

01:31:46.958 --> 01:31:48.833
You're going to kill four vampires?

01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:51.166
I'm not killing Mom.

01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:51.291
Marie Antoinette.

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:52.916
She's yours now.

01:34:14.625 --> 01:34:16.083
Horrendous old man.

01:34:16.625 --> 01:34:18.083
Penniless old man.

01:34:18.166 --> 01:34:19.625
Loveless old man!

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:21.666
What a pain in the ass.

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:23.666
You have no idea how to win a war.

01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:26.750
It's true what they say.
Beauty and wits never go together.

01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:05.458
Our Church must be resurrected,

01:36:05.541 --> 01:36:07.666
just like our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:36:08.166 --> 01:36:09.333
Amen, Monsignor.

01:36:09.833 --> 01:36:14.333
Once you finish the report,
you will need to defeat Satan

01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:16.875
and kill the vampire.

01:36:17.583 --> 01:36:21.375
And if you find
any document signed to the bearer

01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:25.083
that may be of use
to our Church, you take it.

01:36:25.166 --> 01:36:29.916
Banks, account numbers, companies,
documents signed by important people,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.083
ministers, businessmen,
whatever… let them talk.

01:38:24.041 --> 01:38:24.958
All right.

01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:16.500
Okay, shall we?

01:39:17.833 --> 01:39:18.833
Dad?

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.541
Dad.

01:39:23.125 --> 01:39:24.916
What a pain in the ass, man.

01:39:25.416 --> 01:39:26.375
Shall we?

01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:28.291
Dad?

01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:32.291
Dad?

01:40:50.666 --> 01:40:54.375
ARK

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:38.583
THE END
