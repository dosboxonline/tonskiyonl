WEBVTT

04:32.559 --> 04:34.478
-How are you?
-Okay.

04:36.023 --> 04:37.922
A lot of shrapnel came out.

04:36.023 --> 04:37.922
A lot of shrapnel came out.

04:38.284 --> 04:39.982
I saved you the pieces.

04:40.066 --> 04:42.477
You are the prettiest
girl I've ever seen.

04:42.561 --> 04:44.229
I don't think so. Here.

04:45.665 --> 04:48.178
-Would you kiss me?
-No. I'll get you some tea.

04:48.563 --> 04:50.113
It would mean such a lot to me.

04:51.533 --> 04:52.366
Would it?

04:58.395 --> 04:59.268
Thank you.

05:02.798 --> 05:05.842
-I can't sleep. Would you kiss me?
-Oh.

05:05.926 --> 05:08.637
-You're so pretty.
-Will you tuck me in, please?

05:08.804 --> 05:11.032
Very funny. Go to sleep now.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.219
-Where's the doctor?
-Don't ask.

06:35.744 --> 06:38.826
God, I hate giving blood.
Can't stand needles.

06:45.978 --> 06:48.144
Is there anybody from Picton?

06:48.862 --> 06:51.280
Picton? I don't know.

06:51.949 --> 06:55.548
I'd like to see somebody
from home before I go.

07:03.627 --> 07:06.505
-Do we have anybody from Picton?
-Why Picton?

07:07.005 --> 07:09.817
He's from there.
Edge of Lake Ontario, right, soldier?

07:10.797 --> 07:13.597
That's where your sweetie's from,
isn't it? Around there?

07:13.680 --> 07:15.389
Ask him what company he's with.

07:16.435 --> 07:20.857
-Third Canadian Fusiliers.
-Third Canadian Fusiliers.

07:24.018 --> 07:25.609
Does he know Captain McGan?

07:26.131 --> 07:29.736
He bought it yesterday. Shot to bits.

07:29.820 --> 07:32.601
-What did he say?
-Doesn't know him.

07:36.236 --> 07:37.538
Hana, get down!

07:42.361 --> 07:45.357
He's dead. He's dead.

07:46.802 --> 07:49.702
He's dead.

07:50.144 --> 07:51.429
He's dead.

09:16.779 --> 09:19.511
Name, rank, serial number?

09:19.618 --> 09:21.306
No, sorry.

09:21.552 --> 09:23.336
I think I was a pilot.

09:24.152 --> 09:26.112
I was found in the wreckage of a

09:26.196 --> 09:27.897
plane at the beginning of the war.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.617
Can you remember where you were born?

09:30.700 --> 09:32.158
Am I being interrogated?

09:32.874 --> 09:35.738
You should be trying to trick me,
make me speak German.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.741
-Which I can, by the way.
-Why?

09:38.907 --> 09:41.577
-Are you German?
-No.

09:42.162 --> 09:43.812
How do you know you're not German

09:43.960 --> 09:45.510
if you don't remember anything?

09:46.814 --> 09:48.664
Might... Might I have a sip of water?

10:01.185 --> 10:02.821
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

10:04.266 --> 10:06.146
I remember lots of things.

10:06.769 --> 10:10.597
I remember her garden,
plunging down to the sea.

10:11.467 --> 10:14.510
-Nothing between you and France.
-This was your garden?

10:15.022 --> 10:17.613
-Or my wife's.
-You were married then?

10:17.780 --> 10:18.916
I think so.

10:19.136 --> 10:22.034
Although I believe that to be
true of a number of Germans.

10:24.741 --> 10:25.622
Look.

10:27.654 --> 10:30.000
I have this much lung.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.503
The rest of my organs are packing up.

10:32.628 --> 10:35.198
What could it possibly
matter if I'm a Tutankhamen?

10:36.090 --> 10:39.609
I'm a bit of... toast, my friend.

10:41.212 --> 10:42.850
Sorry I can't help you.

10:58.028 --> 10:59.063
Are you all right?

11:00.195 --> 11:02.904
I know you hate to be moved. I'm sorry.

11:09.166 --> 11:09.999
Hana!

11:10.082 --> 11:13.159
-Jan?
-Hana!

11:14.211 --> 11:16.052
There's meant to be lace in the next
village.

11:16.136 --> 11:17.422
The boys are Donna take me.

11:17.506 --> 11:19.523
-You don't have any money, do ya?
-No.

11:19.607 --> 11:21.357
-Just in case there's a sale.
-No.

11:21.441 --> 11:23.444
Hana, I know you do. Come on.

11:23.664 --> 11:24.930
-No!
-Oh, come on.

11:25.055 --> 11:27.516
I swear to God,
this'll be the last time. I swear.

11:28.082 --> 11:29.934
She's a softie. She loves me.

11:32.563 --> 11:34.479
I'll pay you back! I promise!

11:34.841 --> 11:37.636
I'm not sewing anything else for you.

11:38.694 --> 11:39.880
I love you!

11:41.176 --> 11:43.387
Whoa! Pienza, boys!

12:01.665 --> 12:03.412
Get some water over here!

12:04.534 --> 12:06.777
Jan! Oh, no!

12:09.156 --> 12:11.977
Hana, where're you going?

12:13.352 --> 12:15.042
-Stay back!
-Stop, Hana!

12:16.648 --> 12:17.352
Stay...

12:23.322 --> 12:24.314
No!

12:25.658 --> 12:26.825
No!

13:13.608 --> 13:15.499
-Hey! Hey!
-Don't move!

13:15.624 --> 13:17.451
Don't move! Don't move!

13:17.535 --> 13:19.095
Stand absolutely still!

13:20.004 --> 13:22.158
You're walking in a mine field!

13:25.467 --> 13:26.145
Good.

13:27.970 --> 13:28.927
That's good.

13:30.889 --> 13:32.790
Just stay still for me...

13:34.341 --> 13:35.076
and we'll be fine.

13:38.547 --> 13:39.563
What are you doing?

13:40.642 --> 13:42.753
What the bloody hell do
you think you're doing?

13:45.758 --> 13:46.858
It's Jan's.

14:15.408 --> 14:17.689
Are you in pain? Do you need something?

14:18.847 --> 14:20.105
-Yes.
-Okay.

14:23.274 --> 14:24.410
Are you okay?

14:25.157 --> 14:26.060
You and Jan were...

14:26.144 --> 14:28.074
We keep moving him in
and out of the truck.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.499
-Why?
-He's dying. What's the point?

14:31.283 --> 14:32.549
We can hardly leave him.

14:32.927 --> 14:33.785
Do you mean leave him?

14:33.869 --> 14:36.039
No, no, I don't mean leave him.

14:45.521 --> 14:46.718
This will help you.

14:50.219 --> 14:51.680
I must be a curse.

14:53.548 --> 14:54.973
Anybody who loves me...

14:57.559 --> 14:59.295
anybody who gets close to me...

15:01.736 --> 15:03.272
Oh, I must be cursed.

15:09.787 --> 15:10.614
Which is it?

16:38.043 --> 16:41.080
-When he dies, I'll catch up.
-It's not safe here.

16:41.243 --> 16:42.958
The whole country's crawling with
bandits

16:43.041 --> 16:44.917
and Germans and God knows what.

16:45.128 --> 16:47.678
-It's madness! I can't allow it.
-The war is over.

16:47.766 --> 16:48.892
How can it be desertion?

16:48.976 --> 16:51.409
It's not over everywhere.
I didn't mean literally.

16:53.008 --> 16:55.928
This is normal,
a shock, for all of us, Hana.

16:56.095 --> 16:58.672
I need morphine, a lot. And a pistol.

17:04.664 --> 17:06.998
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

17:11.795 --> 17:13.361
We're heading for Leghorn.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.696
'Livorno, ' the Italians call it.

17:17.171 --> 17:18.398
We'll expect you.

17:27.667 --> 17:28.577
Fine.

17:36.043 --> 17:37.721
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, ma'am.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.741
-Oh, Hana.
-I'll be okay.

17:44.519 --> 17:47.034
I'll catch up. Good.

18:54.202 --> 18:56.309
What... What was all that banging?

18:56.975 --> 18:57.778
Are you...

18:57.862 --> 19:01.472
Are you fighting rats,
or the entire German army?

19:02.638 --> 19:06.850
No. I was repairing the stairs.

19:06.975 --> 19:08.267
I found a library,

19:09.220 --> 19:11.188
and the books were very useful.

19:11.313 --> 19:14.457
Before you find too many
uses for those books,

19:14.946 --> 19:16.761
you might read some to me.

19:17.409 --> 19:19.735
I think they're all in Italian,
but I'll look, yes.

19:19.989 --> 19:22.466
-What about your own book?
-My book?

19:22.747 --> 19:25.692
Oh, yes, the Herodotus.

19:25.869 --> 19:28.343
Yes, you can read him.

19:29.039 --> 19:31.875
Oh. I found plums.

19:32.001 --> 19:35.381
We have plums in the orchard. There.

19:35.838 --> 19:37.079
We have an orchard.

19:38.622 --> 19:42.618
Herodotus is the father of history.

19:42.886 --> 19:45.004
-Do you know that?
-I don't know anything.

19:56.107 --> 19:56.562
Hmm.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.152
It's a...

20:08.287 --> 20:11.003
It's a very plum...

20:11.756 --> 20:12.363
plum.

21:38.727 --> 21:43.048
A mountain the shape of a woman's back.
Good, good.

22:07.861 --> 22:10.627
-Hello, Geoffrey!
-Madox, hello!

22:11.012 --> 22:13.944
-Welcome to the expedition.
-How do you do? Geoffrey Clifton.

22:14.034 --> 22:15.324
Splendid to finally meet you all.

22:15.408 --> 22:18.261
This is Dante D'Agostino and
Diggy Bermann, our archaeologist.

22:18.345 --> 22:20.733
-Beautiful plane.
-This is Sharif Al Fouad, Egyptologist.

22:20.816 --> 22:23.213
-And this is my wife, Katharine.
-Hello.

22:23.297 --> 22:24.393
We're your new apprentices.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.664
Welcome to the International Sand Club.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.095
-To the International Sand Club.
-I'll get cups.

22:32.104 --> 22:33.877
-Marvellous plane. Did you look?
-Yes.

22:34.266 --> 22:37.269
Isn't it? A wedding present
from Katharine's parents.

22:37.394 --> 22:38.776
We're calling it Rupert Bear.

22:39.521 --> 22:41.857
-Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
-Almasy.

22:43.139 --> 22:45.557
We can finally consign my
old bird to the scrap heap.

22:46.409 --> 22:48.565
Mrs. Clifton, I'd like to present...

22:48.649 --> 22:50.458
-Count Almasy.
-Hello.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.575
Geoffrey gave me your monograph

22:52.680 --> 22:53.741
and I was reading up in the desert.

22:53.825 --> 22:55.731
-Very impressive.
-Thank you.

22:56.146 --> 22:58.133
I wanted to meet the man who could write
a long paper

22:58.216 --> 22:59.946
with so few adjectives.

23:00.404 --> 23:03.567
Well, a thing is still a thing,
no matter what you place in front of it.

23:04.365 --> 23:08.241
Big car,
slow car, chauffeur-driven car.

23:08.368 --> 23:11.243
-Broken car.
-It's still a car.

23:11.409 --> 23:14.306
Not much use, though. Love?

23:15.032 --> 23:18.494
Romantic love,
plutonic love, filial love.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.061
-Quite different things, surely.
-Uxoriousness.

23:21.145 --> 23:23.904
That's my favourite kind of love.
Excessive love of one's wife.

23:25.944 --> 23:27.178
Now there you have me.

23:29.677 --> 23:31.785
-They're tourists.
-Absolute rot.

23:31.907 --> 23:34.392
They're highly recommended by
the Royal Geographic Society.

23:34.612 --> 23:36.360
She's charming and has read everything.

23:36.495 --> 23:39.540
-He's meant to be a ruddy good flyer.
-We don't need another pilot.

23:39.624 --> 23:41.515
He can make aerial maps
of the whole route.

23:42.310 --> 23:44.188
You can't explore from the air, Madox.

23:44.272 --> 23:47.272
If you could explore from the air,
life would be very simple.

23:48.827 --> 23:49.591
Contact.

23:52.221 --> 23:52.893
Contact.

25:10.506 --> 25:12.086
I should try and move the bed.

25:13.050 --> 25:15.171
I want you to be able to see the view.

25:15.589 --> 25:18.775
It's good.
It's a view from a monastery.

25:18.931 --> 25:21.701
-I can already see.
-How?

25:22.476 --> 25:24.995
-How can you see anything?
-No, no, not the window.

25:25.270 --> 25:27.273
I can't bear the light anyway.

25:27.890 --> 25:30.309
I can see all the way to the desert.

25:30.889 --> 25:31.882
I'm turning you.

25:31.966 --> 25:35.261
Exploring before the war, making maps.

25:35.758 --> 25:37.359
Is there sand in my eyes?

25:38.443 --> 25:40.097
Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

25:40.181 --> 25:42.426
No sand. That's your morphine speaking.

25:50.087 --> 25:52.181
I can see my wife in that view.

25:56.148 --> 25:57.629
Are you remembering more?

25:58.782 --> 26:01.910
-Could I have a cigarette?
-Are you crazy?

26:06.643 --> 26:10.293
Why... Why are you so
determined to keep me alive?

26:12.563 --> 26:14.200
Because I'm a nurse.

27:04.025 --> 27:04.800
Bravo.

27:04.953 --> 27:07.456
# We have an old-fashioned tomato #

27:07.623 --> 27:09.875
# A Long Island potato #

27:10.426 --> 27:13.128
# But yes
We have no bananas #

27:13.295 --> 27:14.995
# We have no bananas today #

27:28.928 --> 27:30.520
-Next!
-Katharine!

27:30.604 --> 27:33.399
'The King insisted that
he would find some way...

27:33.483 --> 27:35.401
'to prove beyond dispute...

27:35.485 --> 27:38.746
'that his wife was
fairest of all women.

27:39.936 --> 27:43.367
'I will hide you in your room where
we sleep, ' said Candaules...'

27:43.492 --> 27:46.036
-said Candaules.'
-Candaules.

27:47.235 --> 27:48.706
'Candaules.'

27:49.289 --> 27:50.704
Candaules.

27:51.230 --> 27:53.350
Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen

27:53.433 --> 27:55.080
has the same practise every night.

27:56.273 --> 27:58.048
She takes off her clothes...

27:58.173 --> 28:01.672
and puts them on the chair
by the door to her room.

28:03.016 --> 28:04.596
'And from where you stand,

28:04.900 --> 28:07.863
you will be able to gaze
on her at your leisure.'

28:09.755 --> 28:12.333
And that evening,
it's exactly as the King has told him.

28:13.355 --> 28:14.580
She goes to the chair,

28:14.997 --> 28:16.753
removes her clothes one by one,

28:17.526 --> 28:20.724
until she's standing naked
in full view of Gyges.

28:21.862 --> 28:24.426
And indeed, she was more lovely
than he could have imagined.

28:26.368 --> 28:29.049
But then, the Queen looked up...

28:30.039 --> 28:32.303
and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows.

28:34.330 --> 28:36.263
And although she said nothing,
she shuddered.

28:43.010 --> 28:44.398
And the next day,

28:45.304 --> 28:48.974
she sends for,
for Gyges and challenged him.

28:49.902 --> 28:51.865
And hearing his story,
this is what she said.

28:51.948 --> 28:52.989
Off with his head!

28:58.384 --> 29:00.997
She said,
'Either you must submit to death...'

29:01.081 --> 29:02.988
'for gazing on that
which you should not, '

29:03.906 --> 29:06.431
'or else kill my husband
who has shamed me...'

29:08.285 --> 29:09.946
'and become King in his place.'

29:13.582 --> 29:15.509
So Gyges kills the King,

29:16.293 --> 29:19.811
marries the Queen and becomes
ruler of Lydia for 28 years.

29:22.424 --> 29:23.158
The end.

29:26.970 --> 29:28.265
Shall I spin the bottle?

29:29.934 --> 29:31.390
So,
Geoffrey, let that be a lesson to you.

29:32.153 --> 29:33.694
-D'Agostino!
-D'Agostino!

29:36.278 --> 29:37.175
Are you asleep?

29:39.608 --> 29:40.502
Yes.

29:42.277 --> 29:44.370
No. I'm dropping off.

30:29.742 --> 30:30.868
Go away!

30:31.053 --> 30:33.082
Go! Go!

30:49.164 --> 30:50.082
Buon giorno.

30:52.334 --> 30:54.433
-Hana?
-What do you want?

30:54.745 --> 30:56.424
I met your friend Mary.

30:57.603 --> 31:00.176
She said I should stop and
see if you were all right.

31:00.265 --> 31:01.845
Apparently we're neighbours.

31:02.450 --> 31:05.404
My house is two blocks
from yours in Montreal.

31:06.159 --> 31:07.710
Cabot, north of Laurier.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.325
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

31:13.744 --> 31:14.550
For you.

31:15.157 --> 31:17.657
I'd like to take credit for it,
but it's from Mary.

31:18.676 --> 31:21.882
My name is David Caravaggio,
but nobody ever called me David.

31:21.966 --> 31:25.123
Caravaggio they find too
absurd to miss out on.

31:26.522 --> 31:27.064
Oh!

31:29.549 --> 31:30.109
Oh!

31:30.719 --> 31:33.117
Oh, shit. Stupid hands.

31:33.663 --> 31:34.563
Let me do that.

31:42.189 --> 31:43.239
They're fresh.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.797
I haven't had an egg in...

31:49.822 --> 31:51.563
Have you noticed there are chickens?

31:52.408 --> 31:54.535
In Italy, you get chickens but no eggs.

31:54.619 --> 31:57.833
In Africa,
they're always eggs but never chickens.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.992
-Who's separating them?
-You were in Africa?

32:01.380 --> 32:02.587
Yes, I was.

32:03.222 --> 32:04.593
So was my patient.

32:06.943 --> 32:09.303
Look, I'd like to stay for a while.

32:09.969 --> 32:10.968
I have to do some work here.

32:11.052 --> 32:14.389
I speak the language.
There are partisans to be disarmed.

32:14.799 --> 32:17.074
We embrace them and see if we can

32:17.157 --> 32:20.359
relieve them of their weapons,
you know, while we hide.

32:20.675 --> 32:23.208
I was a thief,
so the army thought I'd be good at it.

32:24.231 --> 32:26.665
-So you can shoot a pistol?
-No.

32:27.955 --> 32:29.465
Do you have a problem with those?

32:32.064 --> 32:32.817
No.

32:33.382 --> 32:35.742
-I should look at them before you go.
-Look.

32:36.727 --> 32:38.834
It's a big place.
We needn't disturb each other.

32:39.241 --> 32:40.757
I'll sleep in the stable.

32:40.841 --> 32:42.615
It doesn't matter where I sleep.
I don't sleep.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.328
I don't know what Mary told you
about me,

32:44.412 --> 32:47.109
but I don't need company.
I don't need to be looked after.

32:53.517 --> 32:55.151
There is a man downstairs.

32:56.732 --> 32:59.975
He brought us eggs. He might stay.

33:00.142 --> 33:01.805
Why? Can he lay eggs?

33:03.162 --> 33:04.150
He's Canadian.

33:05.281 --> 33:07.450
Why are people always so happy when they
collide

33:07.533 --> 33:08.903
with one from the same place?

33:09.476 --> 33:12.368
What happened in Montreal when
you passed a man in the street?

33:12.451 --> 33:14.035
Did you invite him to live with you?

33:17.099 --> 33:18.434
He needn't disturb you.

33:19.067 --> 33:21.806
He can't. I'm already disturbed.

33:24.813 --> 33:28.504
There's a war.
Where you come from becomes important.

33:28.751 --> 33:31.023
Why? I hate that idea.

33:37.212 --> 33:39.661
Ah! It's Donna work.

33:41.392 --> 33:42.056
Gently.

33:49.309 --> 33:50.095
Can I help?

33:50.502 --> 33:51.723
It's finished.

33:51.982 --> 33:54.694
So, you're our Canadian pickpocket?

33:55.227 --> 33:57.429
Thief I think is more accurate.

33:57.513 --> 34:01.620
I understand you were in Africa.
Whereabouts?

34:01.787 --> 34:03.890
Oh, all over.

34:04.498 --> 34:05.459
All over?

34:07.835 --> 34:11.031
I kept trying to cover a very
modest portion and still failed.

34:11.114 --> 34:13.031
-Are you leaving us?
-Yes.

34:13.148 --> 34:17.154
Now's our opportunity
to swap war wounds.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.547
Then I'm definitely going.

34:25.121 --> 34:26.728
Does she have war wounds?

34:27.617 --> 34:29.099
I think anybody she ever loves...

34:29.183 --> 34:30.507
tends to die on her.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.399
-Are you planning to be the exception?
-Me?

34:35.096 --> 34:36.905
I think you've got...

34:37.451 --> 34:39.043
the wrong end of the stick, old boy.

34:40.087 --> 34:41.190
So...

34:41.963 --> 34:43.536
Caravaggio.

34:44.851 --> 34:47.416
Hana thinks you invented your name.

34:47.703 --> 34:49.259
And you've forgotten yours.

34:49.538 --> 34:53.994
I said that no one would ever
invent such a preposterous name.

34:55.424 --> 34:57.676
And I said you can forget everything,

35:00.085 --> 35:01.722
but you never forget your name.

35:02.764 --> 35:04.225
Count Almasy.

35:04.808 --> 35:06.788
That name mean anything to you?

35:07.227 --> 35:08.199
Or Katharine Clifton?

35:18.197 --> 35:19.181
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:20.290 --> 35:23.598
-How much did you pay?
-Oh, hello.

35:23.718 --> 35:25.885
They don't see foreign women in
this market.

35:26.426 --> 35:27.449
How much did you pay?

35:27.563 --> 35:29.874
Um, 7, 8 pounds, I suppose.

35:30.220 --> 35:32.329
-Which store?
-Why?

35:32.762 --> 35:35.725
You've been cheated.
Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back.

35:36.131 --> 35:37.279
I don't want to take it back.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.685
This is not worth 8 pounds.

35:40.285 --> 35:41.450
It is to me.

35:41.624 --> 35:43.847
-Did you bargain?
-I don't care to bargain.

35:44.005 --> 35:45.366
That insults them.

35:48.402 --> 35:51.232
I don't believe that. I think that
you're insulted by me somehow.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.347
I'd be very happy to obtain
the correct price for this.

35:54.984 --> 35:57.037
I apologize if I appear abrupt.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.857
I'm rusty at social graces.

36:05.433 --> 36:06.910
How do you find Cairo?

36:07.539 --> 36:10.457
-Did you visit the pyramids?
-Excuse me.

36:10.934 --> 36:12.119
Or the Sphinx?

36:16.755 --> 36:20.759
Latitude, 25, 33. Longitude, 25, 16.

36:20.921 --> 36:22.770
We attempt to drive north-east of Kofer,

36:22.854 --> 36:24.148
we'll leave our bones in the desert.

36:24.887 --> 36:27.662
-I disagree.
-You're Hungarian. You always disagree.

36:27.746 --> 36:29.040
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Good evening.

36:29.124 --> 36:31.645
-How is your charming wife?
-Marvellous.

36:31.729 --> 36:33.516
She's in love with the hotel plumbing.

36:34.064 --> 36:36.483
She's either in the swimming pool.
She swims for hours.

36:36.567 --> 36:39.233
She's a fish. It's quite incredible.
Or she's in the bath.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.151
Actually, she's just outside.

36:44.204 --> 36:45.776
Chaps only in the Long Bar.

36:51.358 --> 36:52.333
Mrs. Clifton.

36:54.424 --> 36:55.397
You'll have to forgive us.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.920
We're not accustomed to
the company of women.

36:57.087 --> 36:59.186
Not at all.
I was thoroughly enjoying my book.

37:01.582 --> 37:03.772
-The team is in mourning, darling.
-Oh, really?

37:03.856 --> 37:05.138
I'm afraid we're not having much luck

37:05.221 --> 37:06.957
obtaining funds for the expedition.

37:07.191 --> 37:08.802
Oh. Well, what'll you do?

37:08.996 --> 37:11.601
More modest expedition,
or even wait a year.

37:11.685 --> 37:14.605
-It's a disaster.
-Remind our families we still exist.

37:14.772 --> 37:16.279
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?

37:16.561 --> 37:18.747
Very much so. We all are.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.609
-Save my friend Almasy here.
-I feel much better.

37:21.768 --> 37:25.400
Don't you, darling?
We were feeling rather self-conscious.

37:26.618 --> 37:28.369
Let's toast, then. Absent wives.

37:28.623 --> 37:31.163
-Absent wives.
-And present ones.

37:31.394 --> 37:32.565
And future ones.

37:54.019 --> 37:55.297
Thank you.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.255
Excuse me. May I?

38:13.257 --> 38:16.552
-Why did you follow me yesterday?
-I'm sorry. What?

38:16.959 --> 38:19.164
After the market,
you followed me to the hotel.

38:19.628 --> 38:21.019
I was concerned.

38:21.102 --> 38:23.757
A woman in that
part of Cairo, a European woman.

38:23.841 --> 38:26.260
-I felt obliged to.
-You felt obliged to?

38:26.385 --> 38:28.915
As the wife of one of our party.

38:29.346 --> 38:32.513
So why follow me?
Escort me, by all means.

38:32.597 --> 38:35.352
But following me is predatory,
isn't it?

39:18.686 --> 39:20.606
Could I ask you to move?

39:22.649 --> 39:24.549
I'm sorry, but I...

39:26.570 --> 39:29.730
I'm sorry. Of course.

39:29.890 --> 39:32.393
-It's just when you move.
-It was too rude of me.

39:32.477 --> 39:37.023
-I can't really bear the pressure...
-Are you all right?

39:37.796 --> 39:39.965
I was dreaming. Awful.

40:30.426 --> 40:31.113
Hana.

40:35.055 --> 40:37.647
Hana, are you all right?

40:38.726 --> 40:40.440
Leave me alone.

41:02.684 --> 41:04.250
You're in love with him, aren't you?

41:05.177 --> 41:06.792
Your poor patient.

41:08.173 --> 41:10.295
You think he's a saint
because of the way he looks.

41:10.379 --> 41:11.764
I don't think he is.

41:14.299 --> 41:16.053
I'm not so in love with him.

41:17.434 --> 41:19.343
I'm in love with ghosts.

41:20.768 --> 41:23.091
So is he. He's in love with ghosts.

41:24.395 --> 41:26.262
What if I told you he did this to me?

41:29.401 --> 41:31.635
How could he have? When?

41:32.140 --> 41:34.690
I'm one of his ghosts,
and he wouldn't even know it.

41:35.748 --> 41:39.203
-I don't know what that means.
-Ask your saint who he is.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.425
Ask him who he's killed.

41:47.155 --> 41:49.900
Please, don't creep around this house.

41:50.371 --> 41:52.665
See,
I don't think he's forgotten anything!

41:53.518 --> 41:55.245
I think he wants to forget!

41:58.531 --> 41:59.932
Gentlemen, to map-making.

42:00.057 --> 42:01.176
To map-making!

42:01.260 --> 42:03.710
And a special thank you
to Geoffrey and Katharine,

42:04.452 --> 42:07.340
without whose fund-raising heroics,

42:07.423 --> 42:09.022
we'd still be kicking our heels.

42:09.369 --> 42:11.151
-To arm-twisting.
-Arm-twisting.

42:11.276 --> 42:14.551
Did Katharine say Geoffrey
has to fly back to Cairo?

42:14.635 --> 42:17.346
Return the favour.
Take a few photographs for the army.

42:18.521 --> 42:20.536
Oh, um, what kind of photographs?

42:21.549 --> 42:22.206
Portraits.

42:22.746 --> 42:25.187
The brigadier, the brigadier's wife,
the brigadier's dog,

42:25.270 --> 42:28.402
brigadier by the pyramids,
brigadier breathing.

42:29.823 --> 42:31.725
And I shall, of course, be bereft.

42:32.614 --> 42:34.717
I'll finally be able to
explore the Cairo night-life.

42:34.883 --> 42:37.933
I shall produce an authoritative
guide to the zinc bars and...

42:38.728 --> 42:40.801
I want to say hareems.
Are we in the right country for hareems?

42:40.885 --> 42:41.740
Harems.

42:47.664 --> 42:50.125
-Bye, my love.
-Travel safe.

42:50.209 --> 42:51.636
Catch up in a week.

42:55.279 --> 42:58.425
Clifton, safe journey.

42:58.657 --> 43:02.269
You too. Good luck.
Glad the funds have turned up.

43:03.768 --> 43:04.663
Clifton.

43:09.226 --> 43:10.978
This is probably none of my business.

43:12.469 --> 43:13.216
Your wife.

43:14.847 --> 43:17.670
-Think it's appropriate to leave her?
-Appropriate?

43:18.112 --> 43:21.245
Well, the desert is, it's, uh...
for a woman, it's very tough.

43:22.083 --> 43:24.058
I wonder if it's not too much for her.

43:24.224 --> 43:26.475
Are you mad? Katharine loves it here.
She told me yesterday.

43:26.742 --> 43:27.823
All the same, were I you...

43:27.907 --> 43:29.351
I've known Katharine
since she was three.

43:29.897 --> 43:31.091
We were practically brother and sister

43:31.174 --> 43:32.566
before we were man and wife.

43:32.696 --> 43:34.496
I think I'd know what is and
what isn't too much for her.

43:35.178 --> 43:36.184
I think she'd know herself.

43:38.125 --> 43:39.023
Very well.

43:39.354 --> 43:41.172
Why are you people so
threatened by a woman?

44:25.661 --> 44:27.788
I have come to love...

44:27.913 --> 44:31.697
that little tap of the
fingernail against the syringe.

44:32.793 --> 44:33.323
Tap.

44:35.587 --> 44:36.159
Tap.

44:38.415 --> 44:39.031
Tap.

45:01.980 --> 45:04.105
Stop playing! Please, stop playing.

45:09.589 --> 45:11.344
I don't have the key to that door.
You...

45:15.430 --> 45:18.600
The Germans were here.
The Germans were all over this area.

45:18.714 --> 45:20.218
They left mines everywhere.

45:21.258 --> 45:23.677
The pianos were their
favourite hiding places.

45:23.761 --> 45:25.349
I see. Sorry.

45:31.753 --> 45:34.002
Then maybe you're safe as
long as you only play Bach.

45:36.774 --> 45:37.636
He's German.

45:40.272 --> 45:41.517
Is something funny?

45:42.946 --> 45:44.669
No. I'm sorry.

46:00.657 --> 46:02.174
I've met you before.

46:03.318 --> 46:04.539
I don't think so.

46:16.105 --> 46:18.029
Look. See?

46:18.769 --> 46:21.110
Move that, and no more Bach.

46:21.903 --> 46:24.379
Lieutenant! Are you all right, Sir?

46:26.086 --> 46:27.074
Fine, Sergeant.

46:27.158 --> 46:28.993
So you're working with the Italians.

46:29.243 --> 46:31.693
Yeah, trying to get them
to give up their weapons.

46:31.860 --> 46:34.529
I was a thief,
so the army thought I'd be good at it.

46:34.697 --> 46:36.009
I like the Italians.

46:36.667 --> 46:38.284
He wants us to move out.

46:39.262 --> 46:41.783
He says there could be 50
more mines in the building.

46:42.977 --> 46:45.229
He thinks I'm mad
because I laugh at him.

46:47.084 --> 46:47.939
He's Indian.

46:50.986 --> 46:53.084
-He wears a turban.
-No, he's Sikh.

46:53.685 --> 46:56.199
If he wears a turban, he's Sikh.

46:56.866 --> 46:58.340
I'll probably marry him.

46:58.651 --> 47:01.531
Really? That's sudden.

47:02.185 --> 47:03.777
My mother always told me...

47:03.997 --> 47:06.795
I would summon my husband
by playing the piano.

47:13.871 --> 47:16.471
I liked it better when there
were just the two of us.

47:16.554 --> 47:17.901
Why? Is he staying?

47:18.134 --> 47:20.215
With his sergeant, a Mr. Hardy.

47:22.004 --> 47:25.883
We should charge.
Doesn't anyone have a job to do?

47:26.428 --> 47:29.887
They have to clear all the roads
of mines. That's a big job.

47:30.121 --> 47:33.306
In that case, I...
I suppose we can't charge.

47:33.872 --> 47:35.255
No, we can't.

47:38.506 --> 47:39.435
Thank you.

48:21.069 --> 48:23.405
# Flat foot floogee
with the floy floy #

48:28.314 --> 48:30.603
# Flat foot floogee
with the floy floy #

48:30.996 --> 48:33.456
# Flat foot floogee
with the floy floy #

48:33.617 --> 48:34.478
I've been thinking.

48:34.562 --> 48:37.408
How does someone like you
decide to come to the desert?

48:38.251 --> 48:39.887
What is it? You...

48:39.971 --> 48:41.776
You're doing whatever you're doing in
your castle,

48:41.860 --> 48:43.251
or wherever it is you live,

48:43.638 --> 48:46.621
and one day you say,
'I have to get to the desert, ' or what?

48:48.062 --> 48:51.230
I once travelled with a guide
who was taking me to Faya.

48:52.285 --> 48:54.142
He didn't speak for nine hours.

48:58.147 --> 49:02.129
At the end of it, he pointed at
the horizon and said, 'Faya.'

49:03.966 --> 49:05.369
That was a good day.

49:16.664 --> 49:17.961
Actually, you sing.

49:20.998 --> 49:23.065
-What?
-You sing.

49:23.584 --> 49:24.510
All the time.

49:26.014 --> 49:28.016
-I do not.
-Ask Al Auf.

49:31.059 --> 49:31.823
Al Auf!

49:43.006 --> 49:46.185
# You'd better be ready
about half past 8:00 #

49:46.523 --> 49:48.692
# Remember, honey
 Don't be late #

49:48.776 --> 49:52.144
# 'Cause I'll be there when
the band starts playing #

49:52.228 --> 49:54.147
# Gonna dance off both my shoes #

49:54.782 --> 49:57.447
# When they play the jelly roll blues #

49:57.940 --> 50:01.914
# Tomorrow night at the
dark-town strutter's ball #

50:15.337 --> 50:16.627
Give me your hand.

50:19.329 --> 50:20.286
Thanks.

51:57.897 --> 51:59.163
Madox!

51:59.873 --> 52:00.843
Madox!

52:01.992 --> 52:03.240
Madox!

52:03.966 --> 52:06.813
-Come quickly! I've found something!
-What is it?

52:07.456 --> 52:10.788
D'Ag! Bermann! Quick!

52:28.510 --> 52:29.520
My God.

52:32.356 --> 52:33.535
They're swimming.

52:39.548 --> 52:40.754
They're swimming.

53:11.417 --> 53:12.493
Ow!

53:16.639 --> 53:18.404
-You okay?
-Yeah.

53:45.370 --> 53:46.597
How do you explain...

53:47.990 --> 53:49.639
to someone who has never been here,

53:50.100 --> 53:54.422
feelings which seem quite normal?

53:57.733 --> 53:59.378
I don't know, my friend.

54:01.051 --> 54:02.094
I don't know.

54:08.128 --> 54:09.411
-Aaah!
-Kamal!

54:09.495 --> 54:10.674
Bermann, what are you doing?

54:11.804 --> 54:13.337
Bermann!

54:15.626 --> 54:17.582
Watch out! Watch out!

54:28.255 --> 54:31.238
-Get them out of the car!
-Let me help!

54:31.565 --> 54:33.521
Almasy, are you all right?

54:33.605 --> 54:35.495
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

54:39.665 --> 54:41.383
My wrist! Ah!

54:56.315 --> 54:59.645
I'll be back as quick as I can,
36 hours at the outside.

55:00.122 --> 55:01.966
Try to get an additional radiator.

55:02.050 --> 55:04.051
We can store it between here and
Pottery Hill.

55:04.550 --> 55:05.851
And a better jack.

55:07.177 --> 55:10.514
-We planned badly.
-Bermann?

55:24.395 --> 55:25.537
Safe journey.

55:28.498 --> 55:29.627
Now what?

55:32.048 --> 55:33.711
Let's get all this stuff off.

55:34.366 --> 55:36.961
-I'll stay behind, of course.
-Certainly not.

55:37.045 --> 55:38.701
I caused the problem. I shall stay.

55:38.785 --> 55:39.755
You can't. None of you can.

55:39.839 --> 55:42.768
No, I insist.
There clearly isn't room for all of us.

55:43.088 --> 55:44.024
I'm the least able to dig,

55:44.107 --> 55:45.830
and I'm not one of the walking wounded.

55:45.974 --> 55:47.297
It's only one night.

55:48.135 --> 55:50.078
If I remain, it's the most effective
method

55:50.161 --> 55:52.613
of persuading my husband to
abandon whatever he's doing

55:52.696 --> 55:53.874
and come and rescue us.

55:55.108 --> 55:56.747
-All right.
-Come on, let's get going.

56:42.900 --> 56:44.773
I thought you might like to
paste them into your book.

56:53.335 --> 56:54.407
Well, we...

56:54.893 --> 56:56.099
We took photographs.

56:59.510 --> 57:00.842
There's no need.

57:03.468 --> 57:05.048
No, really. I'd like you to have them.

57:05.132 --> 57:07.510
Well, there's really no need.
This is, um...

57:07.645 --> 57:10.888
This is just a scrapbook.
They are too good.

57:11.084 --> 57:15.454
I should feel obliged. Thank you.

57:30.237 --> 57:32.575
And that would be unconscionable,
I suppose, wouldn't it?

57:33.670 --> 57:35.462
To feel any obligation.

57:39.752 --> 57:40.819
Yes, of course it would.

58:11.654 --> 58:13.138
You should come into the shelter.

58:14.383 --> 58:16.158
I'm quite all right, thank you.

58:16.325 --> 58:19.519
-Look over there.
-What am I looking at?

58:20.489 --> 58:22.591
Do you see what's happening to them,
the stars?

58:22.767 --> 58:25.472
They're so untidy.
I was trying to rearrange them.

58:25.556 --> 58:26.167
No, no.

58:27.168 --> 58:28.128
Over there.

58:32.748 --> 58:34.699
In a few minutes, there'll be no stars.

58:34.885 --> 58:36.726
The air is filling with sand.

59:40.591 --> 59:43.029
-This is not very good, is it?
-No.

59:47.671 --> 59:49.835
-We will be all right?
-Yes.

59:51.464 --> 59:52.284
Yes.

59:54.168 --> 59:55.328
Absolutely.

59:56.656 --> 59:58.883
'Yes' is a comfort.
'Absolutely' is not.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:18.049
Let me tell you about winds.

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:22.312
There is a,
a whirlwind from southern Morocco,

01:00:22.778 --> 01:00:23.938
the Aajej,

01:00:24.905 --> 01:00:28.179
against which the Fellahin
defend themselves with knives.

01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:34.004
And there is a, a Ghibli from Tunis.

01:00:34.171 --> 01:00:36.179
-A Ghibli?
-A Ghibli.

01:00:36.548 --> 01:00:40.139
Which rolls and rolls and
rolls and produces a...

01:00:41.046 --> 01:00:43.351
a rather strange nervous condition.

01:00:46.198 --> 01:00:49.772
And then there is the, the Harmatten,

01:00:50.145 --> 01:00:54.395
a red wind, which mariners
called 'a sea of darkness.'

01:00:56.732 --> 01:00:58.112
And red sand from this wind...

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:00.765
has flown as far as the
south coast of England,

01:01:01.379 --> 01:01:02.774
apparently producing...

01:01:03.886 --> 01:01:06.643
showers so dense that they
were mistaken for blood.

01:01:07.457 --> 01:01:08.572
Fiction!

01:01:10.343 --> 01:01:12.703
We have a house on that coast and
it has never,

01:01:12.787 --> 01:01:14.085
never rained blood.

01:01:14.169 --> 01:01:17.224
No, it's all true.
Herodotus, your friend.

01:01:17.308 --> 01:01:18.841
-My friend.
-Your fri...

01:01:19.508 --> 01:01:20.710
He writes about it...

01:01:22.177 --> 01:01:23.348
and he writes about...

01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:28.247
a, a wind, the Simoon,

01:01:29.275 --> 01:01:31.854
which a nation thought was so evil,

01:01:31.937 --> 01:01:35.129
they declared war on it
and marched out against it.

01:01:36.821 --> 01:01:38.179
In full battle dress.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.484
Their swords raised.

01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:12.599
Katharine, Katharine,
I need to get out your side, quickly.

01:02:12.697 --> 01:02:14.620
A car! Let me out!

01:02:15.011 --> 01:02:16.301
Of course. I'm sorry.

01:02:18.036 --> 01:02:19.728
Ridiculous to fall asleep!

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.130
Unforgivable!

01:02:22.196 --> 01:02:23.312
Damn! The flare!

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:28.315
Stop! Over here!

01:02:28.535 --> 01:02:29.671
Here!

01:02:30.506 --> 01:02:31.456
Stop!

01:02:33.123 --> 01:02:34.403
Madox!

01:02:36.325 --> 01:02:39.310
Madox! Madox!

01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:54.408
Our tracks have disappeared.

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:57.789
Madox will calculate how many miles.
He'll soon turn around.

01:03:04.165 --> 01:03:05.888
Could I ask you, please, to...

01:03:07.482 --> 01:03:09.137
paste your paintings into my book.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.827
I... I should like to have them.

01:03:12.911 --> 01:03:13.680
I should be honoured.

01:03:19.127 --> 01:03:19.817
The others!

01:03:21.986 --> 01:03:23.419
-Oh, God.
-Quick!

01:03:28.807 --> 01:03:31.883
Oh, how awful!
Are we going to get them out?

01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:33.182
Quick! Get the other shovel!

01:03:38.724 --> 01:03:41.529
Am I a terrible coward to ask
how much water we have left?

01:03:42.041 --> 01:03:44.075
A little in our can. We have, uh, water

01:03:44.159 --> 01:03:46.172
in the radiator, which can be drunk.

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:50.075
And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.
It's extremely practical.

01:03:50.951 --> 01:03:53.496
We, uh... Oh, come on! Come on!

01:03:56.814 --> 01:03:57.843
There's also a plant.

01:03:57.927 --> 01:03:59.808
I've never seen it,
but I believe you can cut

01:03:59.892 --> 01:04:02.320
a piece the size of a
heart from this plant,

01:04:02.404 --> 01:04:05.446
and the next morning it'll be
filled with a delicious liquid.

01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:09.342
Find that plant, cut out its heart.

01:04:14.097 --> 01:04:14.620
Here.

01:04:23.009 --> 01:04:24.150
Here's the window.

01:04:24.234 --> 01:04:26.765
Clear the glass.
I'll clear the door. Mind your hands.

01:04:28.026 --> 01:04:29.531
It's okay. We're here.

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:31.959
Come on, clear it quickly.

01:04:35.248 --> 01:04:37.912
Hang on. Coming.

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:48.123
I've got it. I've got it.
-Help them out.

01:04:48.206 --> 01:04:48.748
Here.

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:01.923
Katharine.

01:06:07.926 --> 01:06:08.701
Water.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:28.275
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:33.274
He's not actually a buffoon.

01:06:34.973 --> 01:06:36.473
The plane wasn't a wedding present.

01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:37.959
It belongs to the British government.

01:06:39.536 --> 01:06:41.899
They want aerial maps of
the whole of North Africa.

01:06:43.176 --> 01:06:44.989
So I think he's in Ethiopia.

01:06:48.022 --> 01:06:50.296
In case you're counting
on his sudden appearance.

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:56.240
And the marriage.

01:06:57.834 --> 01:06:59.036
Is that a fiction?

01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:04.368
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.

01:07:09.323 --> 01:07:12.557
Oh, thank God.

01:07:12.641 --> 01:07:14.239
Thank God.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.737
Madox. It's Madox.

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.581
Am I K. in your book?

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:27.731
I think I must be.

01:07:51.673 --> 01:07:52.526
Chapter one.

01:07:53.215 --> 01:07:56.017
'He sat in defiance of municipal
orders

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.761
'astride the gun Zamzammah...'

01:07:58.199 --> 01:07:59.515
I can't read these words.

01:08:00.241 --> 01:08:01.868
I can't read them.
They stick in my throat.

01:08:02.587 --> 01:08:04.287
Because you're reading it too fast.

01:08:04.601 --> 01:08:07.261
-Not at all.
-You have to read Kipling slowly.

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:10.924
The eye is too impatient.
Think about the speed of his pen.

01:08:11.699 --> 01:08:14.131
What is it? 'He sat, comma',

01:08:14.749 --> 01:08:17.656
'in defiance of municipal orders,
comma,

01:08:18.058 --> 01:08:20.470
'astride the gun Zamzammah...

01:08:20.801 --> 01:08:24.111
'on her brick...' What is it?

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:27.301
'Brick platform,
opposite the old Ajaib-Gher.'

01:08:27.386 --> 01:08:31.363
'The wonder house, comma,

01:08:32.314 --> 01:08:35.828
as the natives called
the Lahore Museum.'

01:08:36.055 --> 01:08:38.923
It's still there,
the cannon, outside the museum.

01:08:39.401 --> 01:08:42.209
Made of metal cups and bowls
taken from every household

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:44.761
in the city as tax,
then melted down.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:48.004
Then later,
they fired the cannon at my people,

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.345
comma, the natives.

01:08:53.978 --> 01:08:54.720
Full stop.

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:59.259
What exactly is it you object to?

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.220
The writer, or what he's writing about?

01:09:02.345 --> 01:09:04.568
What I really object to, Uncle,

01:09:06.055 --> 01:09:08.225
is your finishing all
my condensed milk.

01:09:08.564 --> 01:09:10.004
And the message everywhere in your book,

01:09:10.087 --> 01:09:11.484
however slowly I read it,

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:14.269
that the best thing for India
is to be ruled by the British.

01:09:14.697 --> 01:09:17.992
Hana, we have discovered a
shared pleasure, the boy and I.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.781
-Arguing about books?
-Condensed milk.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:23.117
One of the truly great inventions.

01:09:23.808 --> 01:09:25.002
I'll get another tin.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:29.790
I didn't like that book either.
It's all about men.

01:09:30.144 --> 01:09:33.292
Too many men. Just like this house.

01:09:34.001 --> 01:09:37.001
You like him, don't you?
Your voice changes.

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:39.143
No, I don't think it does.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.968
Anyway, he's indifferent to me.

01:09:42.093 --> 01:09:44.872
I don't think it's indifference.

01:09:45.221 --> 01:09:47.434
Hana was just telling me,
you're indifferent...

01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:50.057
-Hey!
-to her cooking.

01:09:52.085 --> 01:09:53.313
Well, I'm indifferent to cooking.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.864
Not Hana's cooking in particular.

01:09:56.429 --> 01:09:59.599
Have either of you tried
condensed milk sandwiches?

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:03.122
They're very good with salt.

01:10:25.294 --> 01:10:26.350
Welcome back, Madam.

01:10:41.011 --> 01:10:41.987
Will you not come in?

01:10:43.324 --> 01:10:43.974
No.

01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:47.168
-I should go home.
-Will you please come in?

01:10:48.954 --> 01:10:50.254
Mrs. Clifton.

01:10:53.369 --> 01:10:54.120
Don't.

01:10:56.299 --> 01:10:57.976
I believe you still have my book.

01:11:14.539 --> 01:11:15.293
Thank you.

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.792
You still have sand in your hair.

01:13:06.489 --> 01:13:08.088
# It wouldn't be make believe #

01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:11.838
# If you believe in me #

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:16.308
# Without your love #

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.498
I'm impressed you can sew.

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:19.516
Good.

01:13:27.951 --> 01:13:29.771
You sew very badly.

01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:32.468
Well, you don't sew at all.

01:13:33.107 --> 01:13:35.165
A woman should never learn to sew,

01:13:35.249 --> 01:13:37.223
and if she can,
she shouldn't admit to it.

01:13:45.231 --> 01:13:46.475
Close your eyes.

01:13:48.865 --> 01:13:50.021
It makes it harder still.

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:54.410
Hmm.

01:13:59.909 --> 01:14:01.459
When were you most happy?

01:14:02.853 --> 01:14:03.673
Now.

01:14:06.388 --> 01:14:08.164
And when were you least happy?

01:14:11.068 --> 01:14:12.191
Now.

01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:19.787
-What do you love?
-What do I love?

01:14:19.871 --> 01:14:22.104
-Say 'everything.'
-Let's see.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:25.616
-Water.
-Mm-hmm.

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:29.377
Fish in it.

01:14:30.885 --> 01:14:33.446
And hedgehogs. I love hedgehogs.

01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:34.580
And what else?

01:14:35.202 --> 01:14:38.134
Marmite. I'm addicted.

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:44.021
And baths. But not with other people.

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:50.000
Islands.

01:14:52.827 --> 01:14:54.047
And your handwriting.

01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:00.208
-Mmm.
-I could go on all day.

01:15:00.576 --> 01:15:01.661
Go on all day.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:11.473
My husband.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.286
And what do you hate most?

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:21.691
A lie.

01:15:24.508 --> 01:15:25.779
What do you hate most?

01:15:31.112 --> 01:15:31.869
Ownership.

01:15:33.588 --> 01:15:34.571
Being owned.

01:15:36.954 --> 01:15:38.731
When you leave, you should forget me.

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.812
Who is this? Don't you recognize me?

01:16:13.812 --> 01:16:16.714
Is it you? So fat.

01:16:22.032 --> 01:16:24.809
-Hmm.
-That's a Christmas cracker.

01:16:25.516 --> 01:16:26.415
Firecracker.

01:16:27.128 --> 01:16:29.964
-This isn't your handwriting, is it?
-Yes, it is.

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.737
'December 22nd.

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:37.343
'Betrayals in war are childlike...

01:16:37.523 --> 01:16:40.554
'compared with our
betrayals during peace.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.915
'New lovers are nervous and tender...

01:16:46.349 --> 01:16:48.036
'but smash everything.

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:53.196
For the heart is an organ of fire.'

01:16:55.842 --> 01:16:58.803
'For the heart is an organ of fire.'

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:04.705
I love that.

01:17:07.462 --> 01:17:08.509
I believe that.

01:17:10.948 --> 01:17:11.962
K?

01:17:13.686 --> 01:17:16.074
-Who is K?
-K...

01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:19.081
is for Katharine.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.940
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:42.251
-Say you're sick.
-What? No.

01:17:42.335 --> 01:17:45.202
Say you're feeling faint. The heat.

01:17:45.563 --> 01:17:47.268
-No.
-I can't work.

01:17:48.667 --> 01:17:50.976
-I can't sleep.
-Katharine.

01:17:53.411 --> 01:17:54.206
Coming.

01:17:56.403 --> 01:17:57.311
I can't sleep.

01:17:58.176 --> 01:17:59.964
I wake up shouting
in the middle of the night.

01:18:00.048 --> 01:18:02.696
Geoffrey thinks it's the
thing in the desert, trauma.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:03.971
I can still taste you.

01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:10.040
-Fill up this. It's empty.
-Oh.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:14.149
I try to write,
with your taste in my mouth.

01:18:18.168 --> 01:18:18.962
Swoon.

01:18:21.232 --> 01:18:22.056
I'll catch you.

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:27.794
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:42.509
-Come along with me now!
-Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:43.835
Merry Christmas!

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.889
-Katharine! Oh, my goodness!
-Oh.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.248
Fetch a chair.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.447
No, I'm fine.

01:18:51.758 --> 01:18:54.308
-It's this heat. It's terrible.
-Is she all right?

01:18:54.392 --> 01:18:56.090
-She's quite all right.
-Oh, good.

01:18:57.107 --> 01:18:59.983
-Are you pregnant?
-Oh, I don't think so, no.

01:19:00.536 --> 01:19:01.641
How romantic.

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:04.239
With Fiona,
I fell over every five minutes.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:07.409
Ronnie christened me 'Lady Downfall.'

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.335
Do you know, I think I might go inside

01:19:09.418 --> 01:19:10.971
and sit down for a few minutes.

01:19:12.337 --> 01:19:14.999
-I'll come with you.
-No, I'll be all right. You stay here.

01:19:15.137 --> 01:19:16.266
Are you sure?

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:07.428
# Silent night #

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:11.807
# Holy night #

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.769
# All is calm #

01:20:16.202 --> 01:20:20.102
# All is bright #

01:20:20.763 --> 01:20:25.041
# Round yon virgin #

01:20:25.263 --> 01:20:27.925
# And her child #

01:20:42.628 --> 01:20:46.423
# Silent night #

01:20:46.912 --> 01:20:50.832
# Holy night #

01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:55.467
# All is calm #

01:20:56.435 --> 01:21:00.015
# All is bright #

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:36.360
# Sleep in heavenly peace #

01:21:40.754 --> 01:21:42.693
Happy Christmas!

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:49.863
# God save our gracious king #

01:21:51.225 --> 01:21:52.700
-Have you seen Katharine?
-What?

01:21:53.133 --> 01:21:54.679
-It's Clifton under here.
-Oh.

01:21:54.763 --> 01:21:56.362
No, I haven't. Sorry.

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:02.876
# Send him victorious #

01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:05.589
Darling, I just heard.

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.259
You poor sausage. Are you all right?

01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:12.042
I'm fine. I'm just too hot.

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:14.464
Lady H thought you might be pregnant.

01:22:15.172 --> 01:22:19.877
I'm not pregnant.
I'm just hot. Too hot, like you.

01:22:20.637 --> 01:22:22.079
I'm sweltering, in fact.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.156
Come on, I'll take you home.

01:22:27.805 --> 01:22:29.613
Can't we really go home?

01:22:31.407 --> 01:22:32.706
I can't breathe.

01:22:33.553 --> 01:22:36.683
I am dying for green.
Anything green, or rain.

01:22:37.491 --> 01:22:39.352
It's Christmas and it's all...

01:22:41.083 --> 01:22:42.271
Oh, I don't know.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:50.277
If you asked me, I'd go home tomorrow.
If you wanted.

01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:54.352
Darling, you know we can't go home.
There might be a war.

01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:04.167
Oh Geoffrey, you do so love a disguise.

01:23:04.994 --> 01:23:06.200
I do so love you.

01:23:08.439 --> 01:23:09.697
Mmm.

01:23:11.661 --> 01:23:13.630
-What do you smell of?
-What?

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:20.239
Marzipan. I think you've
got marzipan in your hair.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:21.924
No wonder you're homesick.

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.173
Is it you?

01:23:48.865 --> 01:23:49.451
What?

01:23:51.335 --> 01:23:52.819
If I said 'Moose'...

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.922
Moose? Who the hell's Moose?

01:23:58.617 --> 01:23:59.905
I look different.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:02.015
Why shouldn't you?

01:24:09.293 --> 01:24:10.769
I heard your breathing.

01:24:11.422 --> 01:24:15.090
I thought it was the rain.
I'm dying for rain.

01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:18.595
Well, I'm dying anyway, but I...

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:21.173
I long for the rain on my face.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:25.185
First wedding anniversary,
what do you call it?

01:24:25.719 --> 01:24:28.647
Ha, I don't know. Paper?

01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:31.857
Is it? I don't know.

01:24:32.581 --> 01:24:33.287
Paper.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:35.947
Paper?

01:24:36.513 --> 01:24:38.641
Darling, it's me.
Listen, I'm sorry, something's come up.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:39.562
Oh, no.

01:24:39.646 --> 01:24:41.371
Now don't sulk.
I'll be back tomorrow evening.

01:24:41.613 --> 01:24:44.513
I'm going to sulk,
and I'm not moving till you get back in.

01:24:44.597 --> 01:24:46.373
Promise? That's good.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.979
Okay, my sausage, I love you.

01:24:52.339 --> 01:24:54.840
-I didn't know you were going anywhere.
-I'm not.

01:24:55.063 --> 01:24:56.693
I'm going to surprise her.
It's our anniversary.

01:24:57.646 --> 01:24:58.951
She's forgotten, of course.

01:24:59.818 --> 01:25:01.185
What's the symbol of your first
anniversary?

01:25:01.268 --> 01:25:02.945
I should get something.
Is it cotton or paper?

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.917
Your first anniversary?

01:25:05.817 --> 01:25:07.607
I thought you two'd been
married for donkey's years.

01:25:08.143 --> 01:25:10.893
We've been friends for donkey's years.
Best friends.

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.539
She was always crying on
my shoulder about somebody.

01:25:13.623 --> 01:25:15.650
I finally persuaded her to settle
for my shoulder.

01:25:15.974 --> 01:25:17.063
A stroke of genius.

01:25:20.231 --> 01:25:22.317
-Moose, are you there?
-Yes.

01:25:23.230 --> 01:25:26.747
-First anniversary. Is that cotton?
-Uh, is what cotton?

01:25:27.962 --> 01:25:29.063
First wedding anniversary.

01:25:29.336 --> 01:25:32.430
Your first anniversary is... paper.

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:48.204
-Stop.
-This?

01:25:49.224 --> 01:25:50.410
S... Stop here.

01:25:51.663 --> 01:25:53.038
-Here?
-Just stop right here.

01:25:53.122 --> 01:25:53.917
Yes, Sir.

01:26:31.167 --> 01:26:32.558
This... What is this?

01:26:34.984 --> 01:26:36.310
It's a folk song.

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:39.968
-Arabic.
-No, no, it's Hungarian.

01:26:42.526 --> 01:26:44.662
My daijka sang it to me.

01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:48.079
When I was a child
growing up in Budapest.

01:26:55.697 --> 01:26:56.879
It's beautiful.

01:26:57.921 --> 01:26:58.744
Hmm.

01:27:00.174 --> 01:27:01.376
What's it about?

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:04.594
Szerelem means love.

01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:07.164
And the story... Well, there's, um,

01:27:07.939 --> 01:27:09.537
this Hungarian count.

01:27:10.601 --> 01:27:12.519
He's a wanderer. He's a fool.

01:27:13.426 --> 01:27:16.597
And for years he's on some
kind of a quest for...

01:27:17.554 --> 01:27:18.535
who knows what.

01:27:19.493 --> 01:27:20.954
And then one day,

01:27:21.059 --> 01:27:24.401
he falls under the spell of
a mysterious English woman,

01:27:25.324 --> 01:27:28.994
a harpy, who beats him and hits him.

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.199
And he becomes her slave

01:27:30.282 --> 01:27:32.665
and he sews her clothes and worships...

01:27:33.544 --> 01:27:35.074
Stop! Stop it!

01:27:35.178 --> 01:27:37.655
Stop! You're always beating me.

01:27:37.922 --> 01:27:39.040
Bastard.

01:27:39.517 --> 01:27:41.560
You bastard! I believed you!

01:27:42.513 --> 01:27:44.415
You should be my slave.

01:27:51.075 --> 01:27:55.005
I claim this shoulder blade...

01:27:55.813 --> 01:27:58.880
No, wait. No, I want... Turn over.

01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:03.415
I want this, this... this place.

01:28:06.042 --> 01:28:07.951
I love this place. What's it called?

01:28:12.016 --> 01:28:12.951
This is mine.

01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:16.842
I'm going to ask the King permission

01:28:16.925 --> 01:28:18.879
to call it the Almasy Bosphorus.

01:28:22.119 --> 01:28:23.900
I thought we were against ownership.

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:34.987
I can stay tonight.

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:44.204
Madox knows, I think.

01:28:44.695 --> 01:28:46.574
He keeps talking about
Anna Karenina now.

01:28:47.448 --> 01:28:49.599
I think it's his idea
of a man-to-man chat.

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:53.476
Well,
it's my idea of a man-to-man chat.

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:02.081
This is a different world,
is what I tell myself.

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:07.192
A different life.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.050
And here I'm a different wife.

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:17.250
Yes.

01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:20.628
Here you are a different wife.

01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:01.730
Oh, they're darling.
What are they? Thimbles?

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:03.505
Yes, and they're quite old.

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:06.419
It's full of saffron.

01:30:07.277 --> 01:30:09.150
Just in case you think I'm going to
give it to you

01:30:09.233 --> 01:30:10.590
to encourage your sewing.

01:30:18.664 --> 01:30:20.213
I don't care to bargain.

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:24.898
That day,
did you follow me to the market?

01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:26.549
Yes, of course.

01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:34.851
Shall we be all right?

01:30:36.473 --> 01:30:37.273
Yes.

01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:40.066
Yes.

01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:44.921
Absolutely.

01:30:45.983 --> 01:30:47.015
Oh, dear.

01:30:49.686 --> 01:30:52.155
# And dancing cheek to cheek #

01:30:52.487 --> 01:30:55.324
# Oh, I love to go out fishing #

01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:01.582
# But it doesn't thrill
me half as much #

01:31:01.749 --> 01:31:04.114
# As dancing cheek to cheek #

01:31:04.877 --> 01:31:06.358
# Dance with me #

01:31:06.824 --> 01:31:09.576
# I want my arms about you #

01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:12.995
# The charm about you #

01:31:13.158 --> 01:31:18.573
# Will carry me through to heaven #

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.560
# I'm in heaven #

01:31:21.983 --> 01:31:27.941
# And my heart beats so
that I can hardly speak #

01:31:28.278 --> 01:31:29.892
# And I seem to find #

01:31:29.976 --> 01:31:32.854
# The happiness I seek #

01:31:34.031 --> 01:31:39.453
# When we're off together
dancing cheek to cheek #

01:31:41.372 --> 01:31:44.068
-Thought you'd never wake up.
-What?

01:31:45.959 --> 01:31:48.545
-Where did you find that?
-I liberated it.

01:31:49.009 --> 01:31:50.197
I think that's called looting.

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.133
No one should own music.
The real question is:

01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.336
-Who wrote the song?
-Irving Berlin.

01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:56.421
-For?
-Top Hat.

01:31:57.261 --> 01:31:58.472
Is there a song you don't know?

01:31:58.597 --> 01:32:01.078
Nope. He sings all the time.

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:05.646
Good morning. Did you know that?
You're always singing.

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:07.726
I've been told before.

01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:10.470
Kip's another one.

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:19.065
'Wang Wang Blues.'

01:32:19.703 --> 01:32:20.661
You're incredible.

01:32:29.816 --> 01:32:31.505
-Good mornin', Miss.
-Hello.

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.454
You saved my life.

01:32:35.285 --> 01:32:36.621
I haven't forgotten.

01:32:38.579 --> 01:32:40.660
I thought you were very, very tall.

01:32:40.973 --> 01:32:44.987
You seemed so big and... giant.

01:32:45.672 --> 01:32:48.180
I felt like a child who
can't keep her balance.

01:32:48.406 --> 01:32:51.338
-A toddler.
-A toddler.

01:33:15.602 --> 01:33:17.404
My hair was long at some point.

01:33:22.032 --> 01:33:24.643
I've forgotten what a
nuisance it is to wash.

01:33:28.221 --> 01:33:30.728
Try this. I found a great jar of it.

01:33:31.338 --> 01:33:32.184
Olive oil.

01:33:33.218 --> 01:33:34.099
Thank you.

01:33:45.103 --> 01:33:46.246
Is this for my hair?

01:33:47.312 --> 01:33:48.977
Yes, for your hair.

01:33:57.591 --> 01:34:00.260
There was a general who wore a patch...

01:34:00.344 --> 01:34:01.966
over a perfectly good eye.

01:34:04.327 --> 01:34:05.949
The men fought harder for him.

01:34:12.199 --> 01:34:14.623
Sometimes I think I
could get up and dance.

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:18.779
What's under your mittens?

01:34:25.717 --> 01:34:26.912
What's under your mittens?

01:34:48.771 --> 01:34:50.375
He's waiting for you.

01:34:51.842 --> 01:34:53.277
I'll see you tonight?

01:34:54.641 --> 01:34:57.810
Look Moose,
we need you to stay in Tobruk.

01:34:57.894 --> 01:35:00.024
I know it's a bit of a short straw,

01:35:00.207 --> 01:35:02.307
but Jerry's got our maps, you know.

01:35:02.489 --> 01:35:05.539
And now they're getting their
spies into Cairo using our maps.

01:35:05.622 --> 01:35:07.995
They'll get Rommel into
Cairo using our maps.

01:35:08.162 --> 01:35:10.341
The whole of the desert's like a bloody
bus route,

01:35:10.424 --> 01:35:11.677
and we gave it to 'em!

01:35:11.845 --> 01:35:13.412
Any foreigner who turned up:

01:35:13.496 --> 01:35:16.378
'Welcome to the Royal Geographic.
Take our maps.'

01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:17.949
Our Madox went mad, you know.

01:35:18.363 --> 01:35:20.009
-Did you know Peter Madox?
-Yeah.

01:35:20.093 --> 01:35:22.471
Magnificent explorer. Thanks, Aicha.

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:25.929
And after he found out he'd
been betrayed by Almasy.

01:35:26.549 --> 01:35:27.840
His best friend.

01:35:28.508 --> 01:35:30.738
Absolutely destroyed the poor sot.

01:35:50.875 --> 01:35:53.430
Hey, Commandant, stay in line!

01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:15.209
Hello, little Tommy.
Little baby, hello.

01:36:16.522 --> 01:36:18.815
-Recognize him? British friend?
-No.

01:36:20.265 --> 01:36:21.240
Aaah!

01:36:24.858 --> 01:36:26.557
-Get up!
-No!

01:36:27.151 --> 01:36:28.374
Get up at once!

01:36:28.458 --> 01:36:30.476
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

01:36:32.281 --> 01:36:34.540
I don't know anybody!

01:36:35.448 --> 01:36:36.224
Halt!

01:36:36.851 --> 01:36:40.516
No! No!

01:36:51.622 --> 01:36:52.896
David Caravaggio.

01:36:53.017 --> 01:36:53.902
No.

01:36:54.459 --> 01:36:57.035
This was taken in Cairo
at British headquarters.

01:36:57.208 --> 01:36:58.572
July '41.

01:37:00.005 --> 01:37:01.608
And so was this.

01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:04.849
August '41. And this.

01:37:05.537 --> 01:37:07.114
February '42.

01:37:08.143 --> 01:37:09.475
It's possible.

01:37:10.075 --> 01:37:12.295
I was buying or selling something.

01:37:12.379 --> 01:37:14.209
I've been to Cairo many times.

01:37:14.568 --> 01:37:17.291
You are a Canadian spy
working for the Allies.

01:37:17.416 --> 01:37:19.262
Code name: Moose.

01:37:27.878 --> 01:37:28.650
Ja?

01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:32.499
Can you get me a doctor? I'm sick.

01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:35.313
I'm leaking blood!

01:37:37.679 --> 01:37:38.508
You want a doctor?

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.532
I've been askin' for weeks, months...

01:37:40.731 --> 01:37:41.746
We don't have a doctor.

01:37:43.785 --> 01:37:44.838
But we do have a nurse.

01:37:44.922 --> 01:37:47.620
Sure, great. A nurse would be great.

01:37:49.832 --> 01:37:54.346
Look, give me something.
A name, a code.

01:37:54.933 --> 01:37:56.425
So we can all get out of this room.

01:37:58.469 --> 01:38:00.235
I can't think in this heat.

01:38:01.015 --> 01:38:04.518
-It's too hot.
-I slept with a girl.

01:38:06.435 --> 01:38:08.509
I've got a wife in Tripoli.

01:38:09.761 --> 01:38:13.097
A girl comes up and points at you,
you only see trouble.

01:38:13.741 --> 01:38:14.891
Fire!

01:38:18.116 --> 01:38:19.970
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

01:38:21.237 --> 01:38:22.505
This is your nurse, by the way.

01:38:23.023 --> 01:38:25.776
She's Muslim,
so she'll understand all of this.

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:29.623
What's the punishment for adultery?
Let's leave it at that.

01:38:29.947 --> 01:38:32.022
You're married and you were fucking
another woman,

01:38:32.105 --> 01:38:32.978
so that's, uh...

01:38:35.770 --> 01:38:36.860
Is it the hands that are cut off?

01:38:38.117 --> 01:38:40.277
Or is that for stealing?
Does anyone know?

01:38:41.076 --> 01:38:44.044
Well, you must know.
You were brought up in Libya, yes?

01:38:44.578 --> 01:38:46.547
-Don't cut me.
-Or was it Toronto?

01:38:48.478 --> 01:38:49.550
Ten fingers.

01:38:49.717 --> 01:38:50.732
How about this?

01:38:51.319 --> 01:38:54.318
You give me a name for every finger.
It doesn't matter who.

01:38:54.702 --> 01:38:56.670
I get something, you keep something.

01:38:57.305 --> 01:39:00.005
-I'm trying to be reasonable.
-Don't cut me. Come on!

01:39:04.894 --> 01:39:06.150
Are thumbs fingers?

01:39:14.869 --> 01:39:17.228
-I get no help from these people.
-Telephone.

01:39:17.341 --> 01:39:18.771
I'm sick of this room,

01:39:18.993 --> 01:39:21.682
I'm sick of this heat and
I'm sick of this phone!

01:39:29.628 --> 01:39:31.013
Ah! The Geneva Convention!

01:39:31.097 --> 01:39:33.128
Hey, come on! You can't do that!

01:39:36.201 --> 01:39:37.504
-Come over here.
-I'll give you names.

01:39:37.588 --> 01:39:39.561
-You!
-I'll give you names!

01:39:39.933 --> 01:39:41.523
-Come on!
-What names did you say?

01:39:42.019 --> 01:39:46.409
Aaah!
Aaah! Let me think! Just let me think!

01:39:46.493 --> 01:39:49.311
I can't think!
I know them! Please, let me think!

01:39:49.395 --> 01:39:52.189
I promise! Oh, please, please, no!

01:39:52.789 --> 01:39:55.036
-What name did you say? I knew them!
-Come on!

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.020
I can't think of any names!
Not my hands! Oh, dear God!

01:39:58.103 --> 01:40:01.789
-What are you waiting for?
-Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, no!

01:40:01.914 --> 01:40:04.416
I promise! Oh, please, not my hands!

01:40:04.541 --> 01:40:08.405
No! Jesus! Jesus! Oh, dear God!

01:40:08.489 --> 01:40:10.630
-Please don't cut me!
-Come on!

01:40:10.797 --> 01:40:13.300
Aaah! No!

01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:17.270
Please don't cut!

01:40:17.354 --> 01:40:18.279
Don't!

01:40:20.557 --> 01:40:22.508
The man who took my thumbs?

01:40:24.228 --> 01:40:27.482
I found him eventually. I killed him.

01:40:28.273 --> 01:40:30.818
The man who took my photograph?
I found him too.

01:40:30.943 --> 01:40:33.383
That took me a year. He's dead.

01:40:35.239 --> 01:40:37.010
Another man showed the Germans...

01:40:37.094 --> 01:40:39.414
a way to get their spies into Cairo.

01:40:40.504 --> 01:40:41.905
I've been looking for him.

01:40:44.328 --> 01:40:46.357
You can't get through there.
It's impossible.

01:40:46.583 --> 01:40:48.919
I was looking again at Bell's old maps.

01:40:49.086 --> 01:40:50.935
If we can find a way through the Wadi,

01:40:51.019 --> 01:40:53.288
we can drive straight into Cairo.

01:40:53.611 --> 01:40:55.586
This whole spur is a real possibility.

01:40:55.794 --> 01:40:57.988
So on Thursday,
you don't trust Bell's map,

01:40:58.072 --> 01:40:59.881
Bell was a fool,
Bell couldn't draw a map.

01:40:59.965 --> 01:41:01.784
But on Friday,
he's suddenly infallible.

01:41:02.683 --> 01:41:05.560
-And where are the expedition maps?
-In my room.

01:41:06.068 --> 01:41:08.022
Those maps belong to His
Majesty's government.

01:41:08.146 --> 01:41:09.220
They shouldn't be left lying around

01:41:09.304 --> 01:41:11.192
for any Tom,
Dick or Harry to have sight of.

01:41:12.252 --> 01:41:13.610
What on earth's the matter with you?

01:41:13.895 --> 01:41:16.406
Don't be so bloody naive!
You know there's a war breaking out!

01:41:24.525 --> 01:41:25.993
This arrived this morning.

01:41:26.412 --> 01:41:28.011
'By order of the British Government,

01:41:28.095 --> 01:41:32.391
all international expeditions
to be aborted by May, 1939.'

01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.308
What do they care about our maps?

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.492
What do we find in the desert?

01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:44.357
Arrowheads, spears.

01:41:45.571 --> 01:41:47.936
In a war, if you own the desert,
you own North Africa.

01:41:48.103 --> 01:41:49.914
Own the desert? Ha!

01:41:52.021 --> 01:41:55.539
Um, Madox? That place...

01:41:58.075 --> 01:42:01.120
That place at the base
of a woman's throat.

01:42:03.153 --> 01:42:05.304
You know, the hollow here.

01:42:06.816 --> 01:42:09.026
Does it have an official name?

01:42:10.862 --> 01:42:14.623
For God's sake,
man, pull yourself together.

01:42:25.299 --> 01:42:27.810
Nowhere is there any wild
patriotic excitement,

01:42:28.094 --> 01:42:30.260
but everywhere there is
a deep hatred of war.

01:42:30.446 --> 01:42:32.250
The answer lies with one man,

01:42:32.616 --> 01:42:35.660
and the solid mass of the
crowd surging round his car...

01:42:35.744 --> 01:42:38.167
are a symbol of the fact
that the British people

01:42:38.251 --> 01:42:40.322
are more firmly of one mind today...

01:42:40.406 --> 01:42:42.169
than at any other time in our history.

01:42:49.687 --> 01:42:53.350
There's a great to-do in San Down Bay,
with rowing and sailing,

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:55.904
and no end of sport
for every water baby.

01:42:58.803 --> 01:42:59.756
Sorry.

01:43:04.263 --> 01:43:06.521
I can't... I can't do this.

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:12.889
I can't do this.
I can't do this any more.

01:43:42.426 --> 01:43:43.548
I'd better go now.

01:43:47.611 --> 01:43:48.704
Say goodbye here.

01:43:49.047 --> 01:43:50.115
I'm not agreeing.

01:43:51.542 --> 01:43:53.503
Don't think I'm agreeing,
because I'm not.

01:43:54.097 --> 01:43:55.672
Any minute now, he'll find out.

01:43:55.756 --> 01:43:57.522
We'll barge into someone.
It'll kill him.

01:43:57.608 --> 01:43:59.405
Don't go over it again, please.

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:13.369
Katharine?

01:44:17.544 --> 01:44:18.231
I...

01:44:19.505 --> 01:44:21.241
I just want you to know I'm...

01:44:22.675 --> 01:44:23.981
I'm not missing you yet.

01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:31.192
You will. You will.

01:45:05.767 --> 01:45:07.202
I believe I'm rather late.

01:45:08.262 --> 01:45:10.944
Good. We're all here.

01:45:11.284 --> 01:45:14.646
A toast to the International Sand Club.

01:45:15.428 --> 01:45:17.009
May it soon resurface.

01:45:17.294 --> 01:45:19.129
The International Sand Club.

01:45:19.422 --> 01:45:24.344
The International Sand Club: misfits,
buggers, fascists and fools.

01:45:24.711 --> 01:45:27.113
God bless us, every one. Oops!

01:45:27.525 --> 01:45:31.202
Mustn't say 'International.'
Dirty word, filthy word.

01:45:31.448 --> 01:45:34.121
His Majesty, die Fuhrer, il duce...

01:45:34.288 --> 01:45:35.664
Sorry. What's your point?

01:45:36.612 --> 01:45:38.833
And the people here don't want us.
You must be joking.

01:45:38.917 --> 01:45:41.956
Egyptians are desperate to get rid of
the colonials.

01:45:42.155 --> 01:45:43.742
Isn't that right, Fouad?

01:45:44.009 --> 01:45:46.912
Some of their best people getting
down on their hands and knees,

01:45:46.996 --> 01:45:48.761
begging to be spared the Knighthood.

01:45:49.097 --> 01:45:52.227
Isn't that right?
Hmm? Isn't that right, Sir Ronnie?

01:45:53.733 --> 01:45:56.268
What's my point?
Oh, I've invented a new dance.

01:45:56.352 --> 01:45:57.935
Anybody up for it? It's called...

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.286
It's called the Bosphorus Hug.

01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:03.340
Madox?

01:46:03.734 --> 01:46:06.705
Or Bermann? You'll dance with me? Hmm?

01:46:08.482 --> 01:46:10.324
Dag. Come on, Daggers.

01:46:10.449 --> 01:46:12.564
Let's eat first. Sit down.

01:46:15.788 --> 01:46:19.124
# We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten #

01:46:19.249 --> 01:46:21.919
# When you're in your
bathing suit so thin #

01:46:22.086 --> 01:46:24.770
We'll make the shellfish
grin Fin to fin #

01:46:24.854 --> 01:46:27.705
They're playing it far too slowly,
but these were the words,

01:46:27.841 --> 01:46:30.481
actually, before they were cleaned up.

01:46:31.679 --> 01:46:35.133
Might be a song for you, Mrs. Clif...

01:46:35.217 --> 01:46:37.343
You either shut up or go home!
You're completely blasted!

01:46:37.427 --> 01:46:39.825
-Sit down!
-Absolutely right! Shut up! Shut up!

01:46:40.693 --> 01:46:43.630
Sorry. Sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:46:43.866 --> 01:46:45.654
I can't think what came over me.

01:46:47.486 --> 01:46:49.278
Lashings of apologies...

01:46:50.445 --> 01:46:51.522
all around.

01:47:25.488 --> 01:47:26.617
Thank you.

01:47:36.827 --> 01:47:40.080
-Why were you holding his collar?
-What?

01:47:40.164 --> 01:47:43.763
'What'? That boy. That little boy.

01:47:43.847 --> 01:47:45.355
You were holding his collar.

01:47:45.438 --> 01:47:47.017
You were gripping his collar. What for?

01:47:47.193 --> 01:47:49.032
Hmm? Is he next?

01:47:49.465 --> 01:47:52.304
Are you going to drag him into
your little room? Where is it?

01:47:52.548 --> 01:47:53.281
Is this it?

01:47:53.438 --> 01:47:54.825
Don't do this.

01:47:55.613 --> 01:47:58.646
I've watched you.
I've watched you at garden parties,

01:47:58.730 --> 01:48:00.899
on verandas, at the races.

01:48:01.167 --> 01:48:04.876
-How can you... stand there?
-Please.

01:48:05.314 --> 01:48:08.108
How can you ever smile,

01:48:08.233 --> 01:48:11.938
as if your life hadn't capsized?

01:48:13.947 --> 01:48:14.917
You know why?

01:48:19.036 --> 01:48:20.299
Dance with me.

01:48:22.081 --> 01:48:22.795
No.

01:48:24.612 --> 01:48:25.950
Dance with me.

01:48:27.586 --> 01:48:29.024
I want to touch you.

01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:33.552
I want the things which are mine,
which belong to me.

01:48:37.888 --> 01:48:40.183
Do you think you're the
only one who feels anything?

01:48:41.475 --> 01:48:42.591
Is that what you think?

01:49:03.519 --> 01:49:04.779
Why don't you go?

01:49:06.642 --> 01:49:10.229
-Get some sleep.
-Would you like me to?

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.003
Good night.

01:50:24.621 --> 01:50:25.376
Hana.

01:50:31.335 --> 01:50:32.083
Kip.

01:51:07.788 --> 01:51:10.402
Just wait. Don't look at anything yet.

01:51:34.412 --> 01:51:35.188
Wait.

01:51:52.290 --> 01:51:53.172
Kip!

01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:16.934
Oh, thank you!

01:53:18.293 --> 01:53:19.318
Mmm!

01:53:34.059 --> 01:53:37.114
If one night I didn't come to see you,

01:53:39.523 --> 01:53:40.941
what would you do?

01:53:42.278 --> 01:53:44.137
I'd try not to expect you.

01:53:47.865 --> 01:53:51.261
Yes, but if it got late and...

01:53:52.036 --> 01:53:53.424
I hadn't shown up?

01:53:56.154 --> 01:53:58.792
Then I'd think there must be a reason.

01:54:00.544 --> 01:54:02.135
You wouldn't come to find me?

01:54:05.398 --> 01:54:08.376
Hmm.
That makes me never want to come here.

01:54:13.946 --> 01:54:15.447
Then I'd tell myself,

01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:17.828
he spends all day searching.

01:54:19.396 --> 01:54:21.565
In the night, he wants to be found.

01:54:27.851 --> 01:54:30.729
I do. I do want you to find me.

01:54:31.888 --> 01:54:33.273
I do want to be found.

01:54:51.805 --> 01:54:54.223
I was looking for Lieutenant Singh.

01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:57.415
-He's sleeping.
-Only we've got to go to work.

01:54:58.706 --> 01:54:59.677
I'll tell him.

01:55:02.271 --> 01:55:04.774
What is it? Is it a mine?

01:55:04.858 --> 01:55:06.762
It's a bomb by a viaduct.

01:55:08.904 --> 01:55:11.361
-Does he have to go?
-Beg pardon?

01:55:11.773 --> 01:55:13.160
What if you couldn't find him?

01:55:13.558 --> 01:55:15.808
Sergeant, not today. Not this morning.

01:55:16.447 --> 01:55:18.766
-What's happening? Am I needed?
-Afraid so, Sir.

01:55:22.062 --> 01:55:23.711
Don't go. I'm frightened.

01:55:25.002 --> 01:55:26.277
This is what I do.

01:55:26.879 --> 01:55:28.416
I do this every day.

01:55:49.379 --> 01:55:50.173
Hardy!

01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:54.025
Serial number K-K-I-P...

01:55:55.031 --> 01:55:56.910
2-6-0-0.

01:55:57.036 --> 01:55:59.913
K-K-I-P 2600, Sir!

01:56:00.334 --> 01:56:01.281
I'll get the oxygen.

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:02.323
Hardy, what's happening?

01:57:02.407 --> 01:57:04.705
Can't see, Sir! It's from the road!

01:57:11.016 --> 01:57:13.349
Tanks, Sir!
I don't know what it's about!

01:57:13.433 --> 01:57:15.789
-Stop 'em!
-Stop!

01:57:18.784 --> 01:57:22.079
-Hardy!
-Stop! Stop!

01:57:22.163 --> 01:57:24.482
What is this, a bloody carnival?

01:57:24.566 --> 01:57:25.919
The fuse has snapped!

01:57:26.654 --> 01:57:28.780
What's happened? Is it armed?

01:57:32.644 --> 01:57:33.743
Hang on a second.

01:57:34.034 --> 01:57:34.962
I'll be right with you.

01:57:36.237 --> 01:57:37.669
Can you see the detonator, Sir?

01:57:40.416 --> 01:57:42.393
You've got to cut it, Sir.
That frost won't last.

01:57:43.434 --> 01:57:46.720
Stop! Stop! Slow down!

01:57:50.902 --> 01:57:54.125
Stop! Stop! Slow down!

01:57:54.209 --> 01:57:56.169
-Go away!
-Yes, Sir.

01:57:57.358 --> 01:57:59.927
-This is making me incredibly angry.
-I know, Sir.

01:58:02.244 --> 01:58:04.053
-Watch out! That'll burn!
-Ow!

01:58:12.268 --> 01:58:13.220
Can you feel 'em?

01:58:23.246 --> 01:58:24.326
Cut it, Sir.

01:58:25.626 --> 01:58:26.410
You've gotta cut it!

01:58:26.494 --> 01:58:28.318
I don't even know if
this is the right wire.

01:58:28.573 --> 01:58:31.576
Choose. Just choose a wire and cut it.

01:58:54.236 --> 01:58:58.354
Get a blanket!
Dade, get a blanket for Lieutenant!

01:58:58.438 --> 01:59:00.969
Sarge!
Sarge! It's over, Sir! It's over!

01:59:01.183 --> 01:59:04.233
-Jerry's surrendered!
-Yeah-ha!

01:59:10.417 --> 01:59:11.618
Sir, congratulations.

01:59:13.190 --> 01:59:16.819
# Heaven
I'm in heaven #

01:59:18.112 --> 01:59:20.497
Kip? Kip?

01:59:20.906 --> 01:59:21.821
Kip!

01:59:22.908 --> 01:59:26.382
# And my heart beats so
that I can hardly speak #

01:59:26.466 --> 01:59:31.513
# And I seem to find
the happiness I seek #

01:59:32.576 --> 01:59:34.211
Hey, we're goin' home!

01:59:34.424 --> 01:59:39.701
# When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek #

01:59:42.807 --> 01:59:44.234
It's raining.

01:59:47.709 --> 01:59:54.541
# And the cares that hung
around me through the week #

01:59:54.773 --> 02:00:01.850
# Seem to vanish like a
gambler's lucky streak #

02:00:02.031 --> 02:00:08.392
# When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek #

02:00:09.662 --> 02:00:13.124
# Oh, I love to climb a mountain #

02:00:13.208 --> 02:00:16.628
# And to reach the highest peak #

02:00:16.754 --> 02:00:20.830
# But it doesn't thrill
me half as much #

02:00:20.914 --> 02:00:23.927
# As dancing cheek to cheek #

02:00:27.931 --> 02:00:30.351
Kip, come and dance with us.

02:00:31.222 --> 02:00:33.800
-Later.
-Oh, come on.

02:00:37.942 --> 02:00:39.048
Clap now.

02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:41.406
Yeah.

02:01:03.934 --> 02:01:05.802
Here comes the bomb squad!

02:01:13.774 --> 02:01:15.271
Hey, let me handle it!

02:01:15.513 --> 02:01:18.098
Go on, Sergeant Hardy!

02:01:28.283 --> 02:01:30.026
Bring 'em home!

02:01:30.110 --> 02:01:32.519
Hardy! Hardy! Hardy!

02:01:37.856 --> 02:01:38.841
What was that?

02:01:45.546 --> 02:01:47.386
I'm never going to forgive myself.

02:01:47.511 --> 02:01:49.731
I'm never going to
bloody forgive myself.

02:01:53.345 --> 02:01:56.150
Sergeant Hardy, Sir.
It was booby-trapped.

02:01:56.822 --> 02:02:00.893
They was runnin' up the Union Jack,
Sir, up on that statue.

02:02:00.977 --> 02:02:02.532
It just went off, Sir.

02:02:03.926 --> 02:02:06.920
Sergeant Hardy climbed up,
Sir, just for a lark, Sir.

02:02:07.388 --> 02:02:09.126
It should've been me. It was my idea.

02:02:09.408 --> 02:02:11.568
-Sir, you don't wanna look.
-Ooh.

02:02:13.275 --> 02:02:14.164
Who's that girl?

02:02:14.830 --> 02:02:16.065
His fiancee, Sir.

02:02:17.796 --> 02:02:20.720
-Hardy's?
-He kept it a bit dark.

02:02:30.231 --> 02:02:30.780
Kip?

02:02:33.015 --> 02:02:34.406
Kip, it's me.

02:02:36.651 --> 02:02:38.776
I'm so sorry about what happened.

02:02:40.926 --> 02:02:43.161
Can I talk to you? Kip?

02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:48.396
Kip, why won't you talk to me?

02:02:51.765 --> 02:02:52.987
Oh, Kip.

02:02:58.262 --> 02:02:59.948
Oh, let me come in!

02:03:26.813 --> 02:03:30.067
Hana tells me you're leaving.

02:03:30.326 --> 02:03:32.026
There's going to be trials.

02:03:32.783 --> 02:03:34.205
They want me to interpret.

02:03:35.119 --> 02:03:37.519
Don't they know I'm
allergic to courtrooms?

02:03:42.459 --> 02:03:43.242
So...

02:03:46.735 --> 02:03:48.690
I come across the hospital convoy.

02:03:49.451 --> 02:03:50.804
They're looking for this stuff.

02:03:51.635 --> 02:03:53.550
This nurse, Mary,

02:03:54.054 --> 02:03:56.185
tells me about you and Hana...

02:03:56.557 --> 02:03:58.738
hiding in some monastery in...

02:03:58.885 --> 02:04:01.221
What do you call it? Retreat?

02:04:02.354 --> 02:04:04.690
How you came out of the desert...

02:04:04.815 --> 02:04:08.819
and you were burned and you
didn't remember your name,

02:04:09.215 --> 02:04:11.935
but you knew the words to
every song that ever was...

02:04:12.019 --> 02:04:15.725
and you had one possession:
a copy of Herodotus.

02:04:16.858 --> 02:04:18.287
And it was filled...

02:04:18.614 --> 02:04:20.782
with letters and cuttings.

02:04:21.915 --> 02:04:23.527
Then I knew it was you.

02:04:28.503 --> 02:04:29.143
Me?

02:04:41.239 --> 02:04:42.254
I saw you...

02:04:43.039 --> 02:04:46.982
writing in that book at
the embassy in Cairo...

02:04:48.692 --> 02:04:51.208
when I had thumbs and you had a face...

02:04:52.696 --> 02:04:53.674
and a name.

02:04:54.782 --> 02:04:55.830
I see.

02:04:58.212 --> 02:05:00.960
Before you went over to the Germans,
before you found

02:05:01.043 --> 02:05:03.117
a way to get Rommel's
spy across the desert

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:05.057
and inside British headquarters.

02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:07.804
He took some pretty good photographs.

02:05:07.888 --> 02:05:10.465
I saw mine in that
torture room in Tobruk.

02:05:11.217 --> 02:05:14.456
So, it made an impression.

02:05:15.552 --> 02:05:18.689
I had to get back to the desert.
I'd made a promise.

02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:22.142
The rest meant nothing to me.

02:05:22.592 --> 02:05:23.525
What did you say?

02:05:24.690 --> 02:05:28.393
That the rest... meant nothing to me.

02:05:28.487 --> 02:05:30.641
There was a result to what you did.

02:05:31.167 --> 02:05:34.957
It wasn't just another expedition.
It did this.

02:05:35.464 --> 02:05:37.713
If the British hadn't
unearthed that photographer,

02:05:37.797 --> 02:05:39.660
thousands of people could have died.

02:05:39.785 --> 02:05:43.674
Thousands of people did die.
Just different people.

02:05:43.787 --> 02:05:47.056
-Yes, like Madox.
-What?

02:05:47.481 --> 02:05:50.462
You know he shot himself, your partner,

02:05:50.546 --> 02:05:52.299
-when he found out you were a spy.
-What?

02:05:56.713 --> 02:05:59.943
Madox thought I was a spy? No.

02:06:00.097 --> 02:06:02.421
No, I was never a spy.

02:06:03.616 --> 02:06:05.853
It's ghastly. It's like a witch hunt.

02:06:05.978 --> 02:06:08.355
Anybody remotely foreign
is suddenly a spy.

02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:10.645
-So watch out.
-Right.

02:06:11.538 --> 02:06:13.719
We didn't care about countries, did we?

02:06:14.445 --> 02:06:16.947
Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans...

02:06:17.354 --> 02:06:20.136
None of that mattered, did it?
It was something finer than that.

02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:22.305
Yes, it was.

02:06:24.987 --> 02:06:27.041
I'll leave the plane in Kufra oasis.

02:06:27.578 --> 02:06:29.412
-So, if you need it...
-Right.

02:06:29.914 --> 02:06:31.967
Hard to know how long
one's talking about.

02:06:32.337 --> 02:06:34.159
We might all be back in a month or two.

02:06:39.553 --> 02:06:40.294
Hmm.

02:06:45.293 --> 02:06:48.376
I have to teach myself not to
read too much into everything.

02:06:50.129 --> 02:06:51.603
It comes of too long having to read

02:06:51.687 --> 02:06:53.377
so much into hardly anything at all.

02:06:59.336 --> 02:07:00.752
Goodbye, my friend.

02:07:07.911 --> 02:07:09.102
There is no God.

02:07:11.392 --> 02:07:13.045
But I hope someone looks after you.

02:07:14.963 --> 02:07:16.510
In case you're still wondering,

02:07:18.509 --> 02:07:20.442
this is called a supra-sternal notch.

02:07:25.518 --> 02:07:28.100
Come and visit us in Dorset
when all this nonsense is over.

02:07:34.958 --> 02:07:36.241
You'll never come to Dorset.

02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:49.403
So, you didn't know Madox shot himself.

02:07:54.447 --> 02:07:55.462
No.

02:07:56.362 --> 02:07:58.446
And you didn't kill the Cliftons?

02:08:07.643 --> 02:08:08.368
Sh...

02:08:14.868 --> 02:08:15.709
She...

02:08:19.710 --> 02:08:20.721
She die...

02:08:23.444 --> 02:08:25.029
She... I can't.

02:08:28.537 --> 02:08:29.409
Well,

02:08:31.665 --> 02:08:33.208
maybe I did.

02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:39.892
Maybe I did.

02:08:47.625 --> 02:08:50.378
I was packing up our base camp...

02:08:50.462 --> 02:08:52.392
at the Cave of Swimmers.

02:08:52.930 --> 02:08:57.518
Clifton had offered to fly
down from Cairo to collect me.

02:08:58.093 --> 02:09:00.944
He flew like a madman always,

02:09:01.028 --> 02:09:03.085
so I... I took no notice.

02:09:12.422 --> 02:09:13.958
Aaah!

02:09:39.378 --> 02:09:40.372
Katharine?

02:09:42.265 --> 02:09:45.206
Dear God,
Katharine, what are you doing here?

02:09:46.198 --> 02:09:48.798
I can't get out. I can't move.

02:09:53.163 --> 02:09:54.834
'Surprise, ' he said.

02:09:57.042 --> 02:09:58.325
Poor Geoffrey.

02:09:59.795 --> 02:10:02.666
He knew. He must've known all the time.

02:10:04.591 --> 02:10:07.208
He was shouting, 'I love you, Katharine.
I love you so much.'

02:10:10.514 --> 02:10:11.737
Is he badly hurt?

02:10:14.791 --> 02:10:15.878
I have to get you out.

02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:19.120
-Please don't move me.
-I have to get you out.

02:10:19.273 --> 02:10:22.783
-It hurts too much.
-I know, darling, I know. I'm sorry.

02:10:23.110 --> 02:10:23.848
Come on.

02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:28.574
Now!

02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:48.357
Why did you hate me?

02:10:49.219 --> 02:10:49.862
What?

02:10:53.925 --> 02:10:56.185
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?

02:10:56.269 --> 02:10:59.027
Shh. Don't talk.

02:11:00.123 --> 02:11:02.149
You speak so many bloody languages...

02:11:02.233 --> 02:11:03.806
and you never want to talk.

02:11:10.824 --> 02:11:14.036
-You're wearing the thimble.
-Of course.

02:11:14.804 --> 02:11:16.123
You idiot.

02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:19.222
I always wear it. I've always worn it.

02:11:20.831 --> 02:11:22.123
I've always loved you.

02:11:58.938 --> 02:12:00.272
It's so cold.

02:12:00.598 --> 02:12:02.757
I know. I'm sorry.

02:12:05.749 --> 02:12:06.720
I'll make a fire.

02:12:13.204 --> 02:12:15.055
Did you get Geoffrey out of the plane?

02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:18.333
-Yes, I did.
-Good. That's good. Thank you.

02:12:24.012 --> 02:12:25.107
Listen to me, Katharine.

02:12:26.478 --> 02:12:27.693
You've broken your ankle...

02:12:27.818 --> 02:12:29.634
and I'm going to have
to try and bind it.

02:12:30.446 --> 02:12:32.529
I think you've also
broken your wrist...

02:12:33.073 --> 02:12:35.859
and maybe some ribs, which is
why it's hurting you to breathe.

02:12:36.855 --> 02:12:39.246
I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.

02:12:40.094 --> 02:12:43.418
Although, given all the traffic
in the desert these days,

02:12:43.522 --> 02:12:46.732
I'm bound to bump into
one army or another.

02:12:47.482 --> 02:12:50.212
And then I'll come back
and you'll be fine.

02:12:51.602 --> 02:12:52.509
You promise?

02:12:54.138 --> 02:12:55.679
I wouldn't want to die here.

02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:58.356
I don't want to die in the desert.

02:13:03.658 --> 02:13:06.183
I've always had a rather
elaborate funeral in mind.

02:13:08.025 --> 02:13:09.382
Particular hymns.

02:13:10.139 --> 02:13:12.291
And I know exactly where
I want to be buried.

02:13:14.865 --> 02:13:16.557
In our garden, where I grew up...

02:13:18.727 --> 02:13:20.242
with a view of the sea.

02:13:22.088 --> 02:13:23.831
So promise me you'll come back for me.

02:13:25.462 --> 02:13:26.295
I promise...

02:13:27.524 --> 02:13:28.570
I'll come back for you.

02:13:31.128 --> 02:13:32.326
I promise...

02:13:33.967 --> 02:13:35.188
I'll never leave you.

02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:42.428
You have plenty of water...

02:13:43.394 --> 02:13:45.084
and, um, food.

02:13:47.352 --> 02:13:48.915
I'll open them for you.

02:13:54.311 --> 02:13:55.300
A good read.

02:13:59.917 --> 02:14:01.086
Don't waste this.

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:07.793
Will you bury Geoffrey?

02:14:12.715 --> 02:14:14.033
I know he's dead.

02:14:18.322 --> 02:14:19.761
I'm sorry, Katharine.

02:14:21.682 --> 02:14:22.385
I know.

02:14:30.894 --> 02:14:31.954
Every night...

02:14:34.111 --> 02:14:35.560
I cut out my heart.

02:14:41.659 --> 02:14:43.732
But in the morning it was full again.

02:14:51.554 --> 02:14:52.476
Darling.

02:14:54.681 --> 02:14:55.698
My darling.

02:15:23.619 --> 02:15:26.315
# You'd better be ready
about half past 8:00 #

02:15:26.914 --> 02:15:28.992
# Now, honey
Don't you be late #

02:15:29.076 --> 02:15:31.913
# I'm going to be there when
the band starts playing #

02:15:32.211 --> 02:15:34.254
# Remember
When we get there, honey #

02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:36.924
# An invitation to
the strutter's ball #

02:15:37.091 --> 02:15:39.134
# A very swell affair #

02:15:39.495 --> 02:15:41.637
# All the highbrows will be there #

02:15:41.804 --> 02:15:45.432
# I'll be down to get you in a taxi,
honey #

02:15:45.557 --> 02:15:48.542
# I stopped at noon and at twilight #

02:15:49.770 --> 02:15:53.547
Three days there on foot, I told her,

02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:57.830
and three hours back by car.

02:16:00.322 --> 02:16:01.640
Don't go anywhere.

02:16:03.867 --> 02:16:04.786
I'll be back.

02:16:08.912 --> 02:16:09.849
I'll be back.

02:16:28.046 --> 02:16:29.749
Just walked in from the desert, Sir.

02:16:31.544 --> 02:16:32.306
Morning.

02:16:46.761 --> 02:16:49.620
Dear golly,
where have you come from then?

02:16:51.245 --> 02:16:53.041
There's been an accident.

02:16:53.862 --> 02:16:55.146
I need a doctor...

02:16:55.835 --> 02:16:58.818
to come with me,
and I need to borrow this car.

02:16:59.512 --> 02:17:00.462
I'll pay, of course.

02:17:00.546 --> 02:17:04.662
-And I need... I need morphine.
-May I see your papers, Sir?

02:17:06.537 --> 02:17:07.291
What?

02:17:07.505 --> 02:17:09.574
If I could just see some
form of identification.

02:17:10.893 --> 02:17:14.204
I'm sorry, I'm not making sense.
Forgive me, I... I'm not...

02:17:14.438 --> 02:17:16.680
I've been walking and...

02:17:17.023 --> 02:17:20.696
A woman is badly injured at the
Gilf Kabir,

02:17:21.102 --> 02:17:21.903
the Cave of Swimmers.

02:17:21.986 --> 02:17:24.573
I'm a member of the Royal
Geographical Society.

02:17:25.013 --> 02:17:25.796
Right.

02:17:27.450 --> 02:17:30.829
Now, if I could... just take your name.

02:17:33.915 --> 02:17:38.504
Count Laszlo de Almasy.

02:17:40.798 --> 02:17:44.884
'Almasy.'
Would you mind spelling that for me?

02:17:44.968 --> 02:17:48.168
-Look, listen to me, will you?
-What nationality would that be?

02:17:48.378 --> 02:17:52.187
A woman is dying. My wife is dying.

02:17:52.388 --> 02:17:55.306
I have been... walking...

02:17:58.145 --> 02:18:00.566
I have been walking for three days.

02:18:00.734 --> 02:18:03.111
I do not want to spell my name.

02:18:03.278 --> 02:18:06.477
-I want you to give me this car.
-I understand you're agitated.

02:18:06.603 --> 02:18:09.660
Perhaps if you'd like to sit down,
I can radio back to HQ.

02:18:10.055 --> 02:18:14.620
No. No, don't... Don't radio anybody!

02:18:14.959 --> 02:18:18.884
Just give me the fucking car!

02:19:18.603 --> 02:19:22.513
Stop the car, please. A woman is dying!

02:19:22.597 --> 02:19:24.824
Listen, Fritz, if I have to
listen to another word from you,

02:19:24.907 --> 02:19:26.596
I'm going to give you
a fucking good hiding!

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:29.614
Fritz?
What are you talking about, Fritz?

02:19:29.698 --> 02:19:31.117
Well, that's your name, isn't it?

02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:33.415
Count Fuckin' Asshole Von Bismarck!

02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:35.816
-What's that supposed to be, Irish?
-Please!

02:19:35.925 --> 02:19:39.763
You have to listen! Katharine!

02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:42.557
Katharine!

02:19:56.262 --> 02:19:57.287
Excuse me.

02:19:57.915 --> 02:20:00.771
-I also need to use the lavatory.
-You'll have to wait.

02:20:00.938 --> 02:20:03.756
-It's urgent.
-Sarge!

02:20:05.337 --> 02:20:07.861
Sarge, Jerry wants to use the lav.

02:20:08.381 --> 02:20:09.657
Says it's urgent.

02:20:12.566 --> 02:20:16.141
-Where are we going, please?
-Oh, up north to the coast.

02:20:16.225 --> 02:20:18.644
Benghazi. Soon be there.

02:20:19.018 --> 02:20:20.577
You can get your boat back home then.

02:20:21.723 --> 02:20:25.091
All right, go on then.
Here, you take him.

02:20:25.175 --> 02:20:27.883
I've been up and down
this bloody train all day.

02:20:43.771 --> 02:20:44.916
It doesn't open.

02:21:00.860 --> 02:21:01.931
Aaah!

02:21:56.334 --> 02:21:57.414
So yes,

02:21:59.503 --> 02:22:02.280
she died because of me.

02:22:05.498 --> 02:22:06.746
Because I loved her.

02:22:11.453 --> 02:22:12.405
Because I...

02:22:16.833 --> 02:22:18.417
Because I had the wrong name.

02:22:28.581 --> 02:22:32.793
-And you never got back to the cave?
-I did get back.

02:22:33.686 --> 02:22:35.540
I kept my promise.

02:22:37.714 --> 02:22:39.982
I was assisted by the Germans.

02:22:40.931 --> 02:22:42.761
There was a... a trade.

02:22:43.392 --> 02:22:46.518
I had our expedition maps.

02:22:46.969 --> 02:22:49.857
And after the British
made me their enemy,

02:22:50.050 --> 02:22:53.734
I gave their enemy our maps.

02:23:06.571 --> 02:23:08.380
So I got back to the desert...

02:23:09.096 --> 02:23:10.243
and to Katharine...

02:23:11.587 --> 02:23:13.797
in Madox's English plane...

02:23:13.964 --> 02:23:15.363
with German gasoline.

02:23:20.932 --> 02:23:23.721
When I arrived in Italy,

02:23:23.805 --> 02:23:26.268
on my medical chart they wrote,

02:23:26.682 --> 02:23:27.882
'English Patient.'

02:23:29.489 --> 02:23:30.581
Isn't that funny?

02:23:32.195 --> 02:23:35.084
After all that, I became English.

02:23:38.997 --> 02:23:42.071
You get to the morning and the
poison leaks away, doesn't it?

02:23:46.723 --> 02:23:48.050
Black nights.

02:23:52.969 --> 02:23:55.700
-I thought I would kill you.
-You can't kill me.

02:23:57.586 --> 02:23:59.214
I died years ago.

02:24:03.681 --> 02:24:05.615
No, I can't kill you now.

02:24:25.536 --> 02:24:28.639
We've been posted. North of Florence.

02:24:35.323 --> 02:24:36.974
I was thinking yesterday...

02:24:38.632 --> 02:24:39.582
yesterday...

02:24:41.218 --> 02:24:42.521
The patient and Hardy.

02:24:43.762 --> 02:24:45.447
They're everything that's
good about England.

02:24:47.889 --> 02:24:49.643
I couldn't even say what that was.

02:24:52.312 --> 02:24:54.769
We didn't exchange two personal words,

02:24:55.816 --> 02:24:58.416
and we've been together
through some terrible things.

02:24:58.811 --> 02:25:00.240
Some terrible things.

02:25:02.059 --> 02:25:04.105
He was engaged to a
girl in the village.

02:25:05.355 --> 02:25:06.138
I mean...

02:25:07.870 --> 02:25:11.419
And us, he never once...

02:25:12.153 --> 02:25:14.096
He didn't ask me if
I could spin the ball

02:25:14.209 --> 02:25:16.408
at cricket or kama sutra or...

02:25:30.851 --> 02:25:32.947
I don't even know what
I'm talking about.

02:25:34.509 --> 02:25:35.779
You loved him.

02:27:00.065 --> 02:27:01.105
Katharine.

02:27:15.706 --> 02:27:17.188
I'm still here.

02:27:19.793 --> 02:27:21.128
You'd better be.

02:27:22.504 --> 02:27:24.148
Don't depend on it, will you?

02:27:26.592 --> 02:27:29.430
That little bit of air in my lungs,

02:27:30.054 --> 02:27:33.170
each day it gets less and less.

02:27:35.225 --> 02:27:36.426
Which is all right.

02:27:37.603 --> 02:27:38.817
It's quite all right.

02:27:42.149 --> 02:27:44.590
I've been speaking to Caravaggio,

02:27:45.682 --> 02:27:47.165
my research assistant.

02:27:48.685 --> 02:27:51.913
He tells me there's a
ghost in the cloisters.

02:27:53.494 --> 02:27:54.528
I can join him.

02:27:58.085 --> 02:28:00.098
-Hana!
-It's the boy.

02:28:25.584 --> 02:28:27.573
I'll always go back to that church.

02:28:28.570 --> 02:28:30.108
Look at my paintings.

02:28:35.244 --> 02:28:37.362
I'll always go back to that church.

02:28:39.692 --> 02:28:40.971
So one day we'll meet.

02:30:33.827 --> 02:30:34.473
Thank you.

02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:48.564
Read to me, will you?

02:30:54.633 --> 02:30:55.857
Read me to sleep.

02:31:20.117 --> 02:31:21.462
'My darling,

02:31:22.828 --> 02:31:24.431
'I'm waiting for you.'

02:31:25.664 --> 02:31:27.933
'How long is a day in the dark?'

02:31:29.463 --> 02:31:30.477
'Or a week?'

02:31:40.036 --> 02:31:41.653
'The fire is gone now...

02:31:42.222 --> 02:31:45.142
and I'm horr... horribly cold.'

02:31:47.102 --> 02:31:49.004
I really ought to drag myself outside,

02:31:49.088 --> 02:31:50.267
but then there'd be the sun.

02:31:53.117 --> 02:31:54.860
I'm afraid I waste the light...

02:31:54.985 --> 02:31:57.310
on the paintings and
on writing these words.

02:32:01.613 --> 02:32:02.582
We die.

02:32:04.074 --> 02:32:05.357
'We die.

02:32:05.746 --> 02:32:08.916
'We die rich with lovers and tribes,

02:32:09.724 --> 02:32:11.746
'tastes we have swallowed,

02:32:12.961 --> 02:32:15.756
'bodies we have entered...

02:32:16.193 --> 02:32:18.092
and swum up like rivers.'

02:32:19.229 --> 02:32:20.763
Fears we've hidden in,

02:32:21.863 --> 02:32:23.418
like this wretched cave.

02:32:29.853 --> 02:32:31.883
I want all this marked on my body.

02:32:34.817 --> 02:32:36.424
We're the real countries.

02:32:37.547 --> 02:32:39.966
Not the boundaries drawn on maps,

02:32:40.807 --> 02:32:42.499
the names of powerful men.

02:32:53.877 --> 02:32:57.233
I know you'll come and carry me
out into the palace of winds.

02:33:05.723 --> 02:33:07.243
That's all I've wanted,

02:33:08.767 --> 02:33:10.839
to walk in such a place with you,

02:33:12.771 --> 02:33:14.037
with friends.

02:33:15.733 --> 02:33:17.274
An Earth without maps.

02:33:23.574 --> 02:33:25.184
'The lamp's gone out,

02:33:26.410 --> 02:33:27.478
'and I'm writing...

02:33:29.913 --> 02:33:31.253
in the darkness.'

02:34:35.121 --> 02:34:36.248
Hana?

02:34:37.648 --> 02:34:39.317
Hana, come on!

02:34:42.453 --> 02:34:43.216
Hana,

02:34:46.247 --> 02:34:47.616
this is Gioia.

02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:49.011
-Buon giorno.
-Buon giorno.

02:34:50.828 --> 02:34:52.246
She'll take you as far as Florence.

02:34:52.571 --> 02:34:53.725
I can get in back.
