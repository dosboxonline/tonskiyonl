WEBVTT

06:07.715 --> 06:10.457
You know,
they're all here for you.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.154
I don't care.

06:12.284 --> 06:15.549
- You don't?

06:15.679 --> 06:17.855
What about presents?
Do you care about presents?

06:17.986 --> 06:19.770
A little.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.165
What about... cake?

06:24.732 --> 06:25.689
There's a cake?

06:25.863 --> 06:27.735
Yeah. Of course
there's a cake.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.780
Chocolate?

06:29.911 --> 06:32.348
Mm... I don't know.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.743
- Then I don't care.
- I mean,
it could be chocolate.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.788
Your mother knows
how much you love chocolate.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.618
She also knows
how much I hate parties.

06:41.749 --> 06:42.880
Look where we are.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.404
Why don't you
just come with me?

06:44.534 --> 06:46.449
We'll go, we'll see
what the cake situation is.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.626
No. Everyone always
messes up my hair,

06:49.757 --> 06:52.499
they pinch my cheeks.
It's annoying.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.023
Well, I-I promise
to protect you.

06:55.153 --> 06:58.069
No one will even get
close enough
for a handshake.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.724
They'll come close, I'll--
take out the gun on 'em
right there.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.639
Get out! Get!

07:03.988 --> 07:05.337
How many presents
did you see?

07:05.468 --> 07:07.078
Enough that I can
call it a pile.

07:07.209 --> 07:09.472
- It's that big?
- Yeah!

07:09.603 --> 07:11.300
- Really?
- You ready?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.563
- Yeah.
- All right. Come on.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.618
Hey, Adam!
Happy birthday.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.097
Thanks, man.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.450
- Hey--!
- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

07:30.580 --> 07:33.148
- What?
- You don't have
any authorization.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.803
Oh, and how do I get
authorization?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.722
- Cake.
- Cake?

07:41.852 --> 07:42.549
Yeah.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.073
Huh. What flavor?

07:49.164 --> 07:50.121
Chocolate.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.428
Chocolate.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.474
Huh. I'll see
what I can do.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.827
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

07:59.957 --> 08:03.047
<i>♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪</i>

08:03.178 --> 08:07.574
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday, dear Adam ♪</i>

08:07.704 --> 08:10.577
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪</i>

08:39.519 --> 08:40.650
It was him.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.347
Yeah.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.960
Norit, I'm sorry
for interrupting
your party like this.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.484
It was already interrupted.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.617
Are you here
to take Etan back?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.272
You suspended him
for doing his job,

08:54.403 --> 08:56.100
- but now look what happened.
- Norit, please.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.537
Go inside.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.235
Can we talk in private, please?

09:04.282 --> 09:06.154
Yeah. Come on in.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.679
She's right, you know.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.594
The streets are
getting covered
in body parts,

09:11.725 --> 09:13.857
and we're sitting
on our hands.

09:13.988 --> 09:17.034
Well, that's why I'm here.
Prime Minister called.

09:17.165 --> 09:20.037
He asked me to put
all hands on deck,
especially yours.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.822
So, you need me now.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.868
I need you
to follow orders.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.435
I don't follow orders?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.698
You beat a man
within an inch
of his life, Etan.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.657
He was gonna talk.

09:30.787 --> 09:33.137
He was gonna die.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.487
Look. There were
Americans on the bus.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.578
We really
don't want them involved.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.405
After what happened,
you really think the guys

09:40.536 --> 09:42.364
are gonna want the American
back on the team?

09:42.494 --> 09:45.367
American? You moved here
when you were 16,

09:45.497 --> 09:48.239
you served
in the Israeli Army.
You're Israeli.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.981
Believe it or not,
that's not how they see it.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.768
Well, that's the way
we see it.

09:54.898 --> 09:55.943
How many dead?

09:56.073 --> 09:57.335
Twenty.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.555
A lot more hurt.

10:01.252 --> 10:02.514
Where are the guys?

10:02.645 --> 10:03.951
Waiting for orders.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.911
All right. I'm gonna go
back inside.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.221
Hey, Etan...

10:14.352 --> 10:16.006
I need you.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.139
Israel needs you.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.621
Well, right now,
my son needs me.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.415
- What happened?
- Pack your bags.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.939
You're goin' to Marseille
to stay with your sister.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.419
I'm not going anywhere.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.030
No, it-it isn't safe
for you here, Norit.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.292
It's not safe.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.251
This is my home, Etan!
This is our home.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.035
Listen, the bombings
are getting closer.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.734
The next one could be
right outside our door,
or worse.

10:47.864 --> 10:51.346
I'm not running.
Are you?

10:51.476 --> 10:53.348
They're taking me back.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.091
- Listen...
- Good. No, good.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.093
They were stupid to let you
go in the first place.

10:59.223 --> 11:02.487
If anything were to happen
to you or Adam...

11:02.618 --> 11:05.490
No... listen to me.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.971
- Remember
who you married. Hmm?
- I know.

11:18.852 --> 11:21.419
So, if we want our proposal
to make any kind of impact,

11:21.550 --> 11:24.901
it's gonna need money
and elbow grease.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.990
And luckily, I'm prepared
to give a lot of both.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.775
- What is it?

11:33.649 --> 11:34.868
Are you all right,
Senator?

11:34.998 --> 11:36.565
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:38.132 --> 11:40.134
You better give me
more than that, please.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.180
Yeah,
but how do you know?

11:43.311 --> 11:47.532
Can-can you just bear with me
for a second, okay?

11:47.663 --> 11:50.666
Um, are you sure
that she was on the--
on the bus?

11:53.364 --> 11:54.975
She's been identified?

11:57.412 --> 11:59.414
No, I'm gonna
get involved in this.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.285
No, don't tell me I can't!

12:01.416 --> 12:02.722
Don't tell me.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.947
What'd they say, sir?
Are they bringing her home?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.084
I need you to call someone.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.216
Anyone. Who?

12:24.178 --> 12:27.094
Call Avi. Call him.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.269
Call Avi.

12:28.399 --> 12:29.836
We can't come back
from this.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.290
I'm very sorry
for your loss, David.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.031
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.294
- Really.
-  Thank you.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.436
How are you liking
your new job, Avi?

13:05.567 --> 13:07.090
Keepin' you outta trouble?

13:07.221 --> 13:08.700
"Like" may be
a little bit of a stretch,

13:08.831 --> 13:10.790
but it's, uh, it's work.

13:12.052 --> 13:15.620
Avi... I need a favor.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.061
I strongly suggest
you take a moment

13:21.191 --> 13:24.368
and choose your next words
very carefully, David.

13:24.499 --> 13:27.458
I want you to find out
who did this to my daughter.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.593
That's all? Information?

13:31.723 --> 13:32.986
And I want them dead.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.035
There it is.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.297
No, no, no, no.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.603
Look...

13:41.733 --> 13:43.692
the minute you stepped
on American soil,

13:43.823 --> 13:45.650
you were
on the government's
watchlist.

13:45.781 --> 13:46.826
Okay.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.305
Old friends
became new problems.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.438
And when you got mixed up
with all that bullshit,

13:50.568 --> 13:53.833
there was no one to help you
get out. No one.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.139
Okay? You'd be rotting
in some prison
or a shallow grave,

13:56.270 --> 13:58.881
- if it wasn't for what I did.
- I know...

13:59.012 --> 14:00.796
what I owe you.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.583
Made some bad choices, David.
We all have.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.716
And those choices
left a lot of dead bodies.

14:07.847 --> 14:11.024
Like I said...
we all have.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.722
You remember her,
don't you?

14:13.853 --> 14:16.072
Yeah...

14:16.203 --> 14:17.900
I do, I do.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.119
What do you need?

14:25.995 --> 14:27.083
Money.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.217
I gotta go get
a team together,

14:30.347 --> 14:32.175
and the guys I have in mind,
they don't come cheap.

14:32.306 --> 14:36.353
I hate having to ask you this.
Please believe that.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.486
We'll find him, David.

14:40.662 --> 14:41.924
I promise.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.507
Give me
all your money and your watch!

14:59.637 --> 15:01.988
-  Avi!

15:09.734 --> 15:11.519
- It's really you?
- It's really me.

15:11.649 --> 15:13.651
What are you doing here?

15:13.782 --> 15:15.479
What am I doing here?
I just came to visit you!

15:15.610 --> 15:17.177
What am I doing here?

15:17.307 --> 15:18.613
Good to see you.
Good to see you!

15:18.743 --> 15:20.006
Good to see you.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.573
Love the... scruffy look.

15:22.704 --> 15:23.835
Yeah.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.578
It's crazy to see
the streets of Tel Aviv
like this, huh?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.319
The work,
it sucks right now.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.671
There was another bombing
eight days ago.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.412
People are afraid
to leave their homes.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.200
And that's why you're here.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.030
You're interested?

15:46.684 --> 15:50.601
I thought driving a cab
would be a nice change,
you know?

15:50.732 --> 15:54.910
I don't get into any gunfights
driving people to their homes.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.912
Now... there's
no real difference

15:57.043 --> 15:59.262
between walking through
a war zone and driving
into one.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.481
Is that a yes?

16:00.611 --> 16:02.265
What do you need?

16:02.396 --> 16:03.658
Not much.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.487
Is he here?

16:06.617 --> 16:08.010
No... no.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.404
Fuck.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.755
All right. Let's go.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.985
All right...
you ready for this?

16:30.032 --> 16:31.903
- What?! Uh--

16:33.601 --> 16:34.732
Fuck!

16:42.827 --> 16:44.003
Okay, let's go again.
Come on.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.572
Nah.

16:48.703 --> 16:49.660
Last one!

16:49.791 --> 16:51.271
Nah, had enough.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.232
- Anything?
- Nothing.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.929
Yakov said to sit tight.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.670
Yeah, Yakov said
a lot of things.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.042
Who is it?!

17:24.173 --> 17:25.435
Pizza!

17:32.399 --> 17:33.835
We nearly killed you.

17:37.491 --> 17:38.448
What are you doin' here?

17:38.579 --> 17:39.754
Getting back to work.

17:39.884 --> 17:40.929
Yakov authorized it?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.235
Yakov ordered it.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.193
Then why didn't he tell us
you were coming?

17:44.324 --> 17:47.805
I think he just wanted
to savor that sweet surprise.

17:47.936 --> 17:51.766
Surprise?
It's not the best time
for surprises, Etan.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.420
Hey. I know.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.075
I know, okay?

17:58.164 --> 17:59.339
What do we have?

17:59.469 --> 18:00.775
His wife's house,

18:00.905 --> 18:02.733
just like you suggested before...

18:03.821 --> 18:06.259
well, before you left.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.612
- The wife's house, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.441
Yeah, he still
hasn't showed, though.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.660
Oh, he'll show.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.314
So, what do we do,
just sit?

18:18.445 --> 18:21.274
- Yeah, for now. Just...

18:21.404 --> 18:23.493
- get a little time to think.
- Yeah, take your time.

18:23.624 --> 18:28.237
It's not like there's
a, uh, lunatic out there
blowing up Israelis.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.370
Do you have
a problem, Tamas?

18:30.500 --> 18:33.373
Well, as a matter of fact,
I do have a big problem.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.983
But he's standing
right in front of me!

18:35.114 --> 18:37.246
Eli, make some coffee.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.856
Let's bring Etan
back to speed,

18:38.987 --> 18:40.815
and then we can talk
about plans.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.643
But for now,
put your dicks away

18:42.773 --> 18:44.035
and let's get to work!

18:45.428 --> 18:46.603
<i>Yallah.</i>

19:06.580 --> 19:09.017
The sun will kill you.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.675
I should be so lucky.

19:14.805 --> 19:18.505
Can we go somewhere to talk?
Somewhere with shade?

19:18.635 --> 19:20.071
I'm listening.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.422
The Engineer.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.694
Who else is coming?

19:37.785 --> 19:39.090
Hi, Gili.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.359
Let me think
about it over lunch.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.318
You're buying.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.195
Noah!

20:00.764 --> 20:02.549
You've grown, huh?

20:02.679 --> 20:04.333
Do you remember me?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.728
Does-does he
speak English?

20:07.858 --> 20:10.905
- What?

20:11.035 --> 20:12.298
Yeah, I speak English.

20:14.735 --> 20:17.085
The other question.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.956
Can I take this to go?

20:19.087 --> 20:23.178
No. Go order some food.
Avi's paying.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.180
Of course.

20:25.311 --> 20:29.010
- Well, good to see you, Avi.
Thanks for lunch.
- Good to see you.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.620
Okay. Bye, <i>Abba.</i>

20:30.751 --> 20:32.579
Bye, Noah. Bye.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.189
Bye, Noah.

20:37.671 --> 20:38.933
Looks like his mother, huh?

20:39.063 --> 20:40.413
- Looks like your neighbor.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.288
We need equipment.

20:47.637 --> 20:48.725
Weapons?

20:48.856 --> 20:51.162
Of course, weapons.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.555
And clothes too.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.123
And we need a new ride.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.516
We're crossing the border.

20:56.646 --> 21:01.085
It's good to see you, Avi.
It really is.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.218
But I have
to ask you... why?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.351
Not going to find him
in Tel Aviv.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.485
I mean, why you?
Why us?

21:09.616 --> 21:11.835
Getting paid.
What do you care?

21:11.966 --> 21:14.360
It's the money
that's concerning me.

21:14.490 --> 21:15.883
It's not enough?

21:16.013 --> 21:18.189
Actually,
it might be too much.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.887
That's what's bothering me.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.671
The old man has a point.

21:23.934 --> 21:27.198
Someone I know...
with money and influence...

21:27.329 --> 21:29.592
his daughter was on the bus
in Dizengoff.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.987
Wait, so he's using his money
and influence to get revenge?

21:33.117 --> 21:35.424
That someone... American?

21:36.817 --> 21:38.166
Senator Adler.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.735
So, why isn't America
sending someone?

21:41.865 --> 21:44.303
- They sent me.
- Off the books.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.920
Are you guys
having second thoughts?

21:53.050 --> 21:54.661
Second, third...

21:54.791 --> 21:56.924
Okay, in or out. <i>Yallah.</i>

21:57.054 --> 21:58.491
I'll find him myself
if I have to.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.367
I can get us a car,
and we can be over the border
by tonight.

22:05.498 --> 22:08.239
I have a contact
in the Mista'arvim.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.025
If anyone knows
what's going on in Gaza,
it's them.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.288
Okay, we can't be noisy.

22:13.419 --> 22:14.724
No one has to know
we're there.

22:16.030 --> 22:16.987
Like ghosts.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.119
That's comforting.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.034
Gotta do one more thing.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.471
What? To pray?

22:24.168 --> 22:25.692
- I'll be back.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.829
Wait a second. Stay here.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.454
Is this how you say hello
to all your guests?

22:48.584 --> 22:51.370
- What do you want?
- You look great.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.328
What do you want?

22:53.459 --> 22:54.938
I didn't come here
for trouble, so, uh--

22:55.069 --> 22:57.158
You shouldn't
have come here at all.

22:57.288 --> 22:58.464
Is she home from school?

22:58.594 --> 23:00.944
- No.
- She-- hey...

23:01.075 --> 23:01.989
Dad?

23:02.119 --> 23:03.991
- Dad?
- Hey, Suka.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.431
What are you doing here?

23:09.562 --> 23:11.302
He was just leaving.

23:13.696 --> 23:16.177
- Can you stay?
- No.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.962
You need to do
your homework.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.138
Can you come back
tomorrow?

23:21.269 --> 23:24.272
Yeah...
I'll come back tomorrow.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.708
Go to your room.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.712
Hey... can I get a kiss?

23:34.282 --> 23:37.111
I missed you.
See you later, beautiful.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.636
She's gotten so big.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.596
You're lucky
she even remembers you.

23:43.726 --> 23:46.729
Don't make any more promises
you can't keep, Avi.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.688
You're gonna
break her heart again.

23:48.818 --> 23:53.301
And if by some miracle
you do come back tomorrow...

23:53.432 --> 23:55.869
don't sneak up on us.

23:59.263 --> 24:00.700
I'm sorry.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.314
I don't care.

24:27.596 --> 24:28.728
Tel Aviv yesterday.

24:30.077 --> 24:33.384
After the bomb went off,
people ran to the scene
to try to help.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.299
- Next slide, please.

24:35.430 --> 24:38.346
Among them
was a second bomber,

24:38.477 --> 24:42.437
who set off a bomb
while the rescue efforts
were going on.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.571
- Next slide.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.137
Twenty dead.

24:48.922 --> 24:51.228
A third bomb was found
a couple blocks away,

24:51.359 --> 24:53.317
- probably for a third bomber.

24:53.448 --> 24:54.884
Okay. Shut it off.

24:56.669 --> 24:59.280
<i>Yakov,
I have the Prime Minister
on the phone.</i>

24:59.410 --> 25:01.021
Put him on the phone.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.676
Hello?

25:03.806 --> 25:05.373
I understand.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.506
I'll have some answers for you
at the end of the week, sir.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.116
Thank you.

25:11.161 --> 25:14.034
Guys... all hands on deck.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.601
I need you guys
to go to work.

25:15.731 --> 25:17.777
- Get this fucker, let's go!

25:28.483 --> 25:30.006
<i>Abdel Nasser Issa.</i>

25:30.137 --> 25:33.053
One of our informants
has confirmed

25:33.183 --> 25:36.099
that he's not only fabricating
bombs in an apartment
in Nablus,

25:36.230 --> 25:40.408
but he's also running
an entire cell from there.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.411
His building is here.

25:44.586 --> 25:48.634
But our intel
is showing a half dozen
surrounding structures,

25:48.764 --> 25:51.854
containing cell members
or some type of sympathizers.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.682
Okay, so you're saying,
if we get spotted,

25:53.813 --> 25:56.032
we're gonna have
the entire neighborhood
on our balls.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.295
Well, our balls.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.036
There's only one way
out of there,

26:00.167 --> 26:02.561
and that's down this street.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.781
And how do we get him?

26:05.912 --> 26:07.566
He's gotta come to us.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.132
Huh, why would he do that?

26:09.263 --> 26:11.004
I intercepted a call.

26:11.134 --> 26:13.615
He's meeting with one
of his men tomorrow night.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.356
Here.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.488
Zero exposure.

26:17.619 --> 26:21.014
We wait for him to show.
And we take him.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.232
Why are they meeting?

26:22.363 --> 26:24.191
I didn't pick up any details.

26:24.321 --> 26:27.586
Hmm... then there's only
one way to find out.

26:30.153 --> 26:31.154
Good luck.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.509
- <i>Salam alaikum,</i> Gadi.
- Ah!

26:38.640 --> 26:41.208
<i>- 'Ahlan, habibi, keefak.</i>

26:49.433 --> 26:52.436
What's the intel
you gotta tell me?

26:52.567 --> 26:55.222
Engineer is fucking hero
in these street.

26:55.352 --> 26:58.617
Any mention of him
followed by nothing
but praise.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.357
The Shabak
is leading the hunt.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.490
Shabak are chasing
their tails.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.057
Hey-hey, we're all
on the same team!

27:04.187 --> 27:06.799
Okay, so <i>yallah,</i> Gadi.
Give us a name.
Let us help.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.541
<i>Yallah.</i>

27:10.672 --> 27:13.370
Shouldn't cross path
with any Shabak
interference there.

27:13.501 --> 27:14.807
He'll--

27:14.937 --> 27:17.897
Gadi, we can't send them there.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.333
You have guns?

27:19.463 --> 27:20.639
Yeah. We have. <i>Yallah.</i>

27:20.769 --> 27:22.249
- Good. You'll need them.
- Thanks.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.904
-  <i>Yislamo,
habibi. Shukran.</i>
- Ah.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.835
I didn't realize
how bad an idea this was
until right now.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.967
Smugglers make
my balls itch.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.319
How's your Arabic?

28:12.908 --> 28:15.084
<i>Shukran.</i>

28:45.724 --> 28:46.899
Who are you?

28:48.944 --> 28:50.859
We are here to see Khader.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.731
I know the why, but I still
don't know the who.

28:54.384 --> 28:55.516
Business.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.608
Business...

29:01.740 --> 29:03.002
What kind of business?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.005
Our business.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.398
Not yours.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.839
Want to hear a joke?

29:13.969 --> 29:18.452
We, uh, rather just wait.
Yeah, <i>shukran.</i>

29:18.582 --> 29:20.628
You don't like jokes, huh?

29:28.027 --> 29:29.942
Khader isn't coming,
is he?

29:31.334 --> 29:32.422
- No.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.775
You like jokes?

29:39.429 --> 29:41.127
I love jokes.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.694
My friend here has
a really good one.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.261
Let's hear it.

29:47.046 --> 29:49.962
Oh.
Yeah, that one.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.530
It's a very good one.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.663
<i>- Yallah.</i>
- It's to die for.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.602
- Where are they, Fanni?

30:21.732 --> 30:23.952
<i>They left a while ago.
You should have visual soon.</i>

30:26.259 --> 30:29.392
- I got nothing. You?
- Negative.

30:31.568 --> 30:33.744
I think I see something.
Okay, here we go.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.181
We have a vehicle.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.835
<i>Is it him?</i>

30:40.186 --> 30:43.145
Okay, you guys, listen.
We have to take them now.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.800
We've got a vehicle, but I've--
we've got no confirmation.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.454
We need confirmation, Etan.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.719
Okay, target confirmed.
Target confirmed.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.025
Repositioning.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.258
Get your hands
on the fucking ground!

31:09.389 --> 31:12.348
- Hands on the fucking ground!

31:14.785 --> 31:16.483
Fanni?
Get the room ready.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.311
Secured. <i>Yallah.</i>

31:35.110 --> 31:36.590
Hello?

31:36.720 --> 31:38.984
<i>Peace be upon you,
my son.</i>

31:39.114 --> 31:42.988
Peace be
upon you, Father.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.555
<i>How are you, Ayyash?</i>

31:45.686 --> 31:46.774
Tired.

31:46.905 --> 31:50.125
<i>Allah's work
is not easy, my son.</i>

31:50.256 --> 31:52.998
<i>How is your family doing?</i>

31:53.128 --> 31:55.348
I do Allah's work for them.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.785
So they will be strong too.

31:58.786 --> 32:01.658
<i>You must be strong
as well.</i>

32:01.789 --> 32:03.225
I will.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.360
<i>I am only
a phone call away.</i>

32:08.839 --> 32:11.712
Thank you, Father.

32:11.842 --> 32:15.237
<i>And Allah
is with you always.</i>

32:16.804 --> 32:19.198
<i>I love you.</i>

32:19.328 --> 32:22.114
- I know.
- Salam alaikum, <i>my son.</i>

32:22.244 --> 32:23.680
Goodbye.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.429
Just got off the phone
with the Prime Minister.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.518
We are not to use any force
in this interrogation.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.477
- What?!
- My hands are tied
on this one.

32:37.607 --> 32:38.913
There's no time, sir!

32:39.044 --> 32:40.132
There's nothing I can do.

32:40.262 --> 32:41.829
He's setting up
for a peace rally.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.613
The last thing he needs
is the word to get out

32:43.744 --> 32:45.224
that they're torturing suspects.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.356
This guy is not
gonna crack with words.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.184
Figure it out, Etan.
There's nothing I can do.

32:49.315 --> 32:52.013
My hands are tied, okay?

32:52.144 --> 32:55.364
Do not,
and I mean do not...

32:55.495 --> 32:57.845
use any force on this.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.412
Call me
when you're done.

33:05.374 --> 33:08.812
You know what?
Take his, uh,
take his hood off.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.553
Yeah.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.340
Take his cuffs off too.

33:23.523 --> 33:26.395
You, uh,
you want a cigarette?

33:26.526 --> 33:28.136
Tamas, give him a cigarette.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.225
He could probably use one.

33:51.855 --> 33:54.336
I am not telling you anything.

33:54.467 --> 33:57.252
Whoa... did I ask you
to tell me anything?

33:57.383 --> 34:01.343
That's why we're here.
You want information.

34:01.474 --> 34:03.084
That's the only reason
I am alive.

34:03.215 --> 34:06.131
The only reason you're alive
is that man standing
right there,

34:06.261 --> 34:07.784
Mr. Tamas.

34:07.915 --> 34:10.438
We know who you are,
we know what you've done,

34:10.570 --> 34:13.094
and we know what you've been
doing in that apartment.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.574
The question we need you
to answer now is...

34:16.967 --> 34:17.967
"Who are you doin' it for?"

34:21.233 --> 34:22.408
For Allah.

34:22.538 --> 34:25.367
Hmm. Of course.

34:25.498 --> 34:28.239
Allah rejoices in the killing
of innocent people.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.938
There's no such thing
as an innocent Jew.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.635
As for Allah,
he demands justice.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.681
And so do his people.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.509
Where is Yehiya Ayyash?

34:36.639 --> 34:38.337
I'm sorry, who's that?

34:38.467 --> 34:40.252
The Engineer.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.994
Where is he?

34:44.125 --> 34:47.172
You tell us where he is,
and we will--

34:47.302 --> 34:49.304
You'll what? Let me go?

34:51.958 --> 34:54.744
We will take your testimony
into careful consideration

34:54.875 --> 34:56.877
when deciding your sentence.

34:59.967 --> 35:02.622
Only Allah can judge me.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.286
We need
to push harder.

35:14.416 --> 35:15.852
Then push.

35:15.983 --> 35:18.855
Well, my hands are tied.
You heard what Yakov said.

35:18.986 --> 35:22.207
I don't mean
with your fists.

35:22.337 --> 35:23.860
I don't know
if I can do that,

35:23.991 --> 35:25.949
just 'cause I don't think
he's gonna crack.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.648
We have
no choice, remember?

35:39.963 --> 35:42.662
You know...

35:42.792 --> 35:45.708
you're the first person
I've interrogated
for almost three months.

35:45.839 --> 35:48.233
- I'm honored.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.539
Y'know, the last man
I interrogated,

35:50.670 --> 35:52.280
I almost killed.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.891
He was there.

35:55.022 --> 35:58.025
I just-I let my emotions
get the better of me.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.896
And when I realized

36:00.027 --> 36:03.813
that he was not only
not gonna to tell me
what I wanted to know,

36:03.944 --> 36:07.252
but that he wasn't gonna
tell me anything...

36:07.382 --> 36:09.167
I hit him.

36:09.297 --> 36:11.299
And then I hit him again,
and I hit him again.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.258
And then I figured,
I'd already fucking hit him,

36:13.388 --> 36:15.651
so I might as well
just keep hitting him.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.740
Until he was...

36:17.871 --> 36:19.916
barely recognizable
as a man.

36:20.047 --> 36:22.615
I mean, the guy
looked like a Frankenstein.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.791
It was really horrific.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.010
He never talked.

36:27.141 --> 36:31.145
I've replayed that day
for three months since then

36:31.276 --> 36:32.712
on constant loop,
you know?

36:32.842 --> 36:34.279
Imagining
different questions,

36:34.409 --> 36:36.585
different answers,
different outcomes.

36:36.716 --> 36:39.501
And the only thing that really
keeps me up at night?

36:42.069 --> 36:43.940
I should've killed
that fuckin' guy.

36:47.074 --> 36:50.382
I won't make
the same mistake twice.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.211
You don't scare me.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.517
I'm not tryin' to scare you.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.781
Honestly, I'm just...
tryin' to prepare you.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.089
I am already prepared to die.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.484
We'll see about that.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.765
- What did he say?
- Nothing yet, sir.

37:25.895 --> 37:28.071
- So, what do we do now?
- Now, we wait.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.248
- Leave him with his thoughts
for a while, then--
- We don't have time to wait.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.727
Listen,
I'm telling you, sir,

37:31.858 --> 37:33.686
this guy knows
what we need to know.

37:33.816 --> 37:36.515
And unfortunately,
there's only one way
of getting it out of him.

37:36.645 --> 37:39.300
Etan... you know
it's not up to me,
it's up to the Prime Minister.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.259
If it was up to me,
I'd let you off your leash.

37:41.389 --> 37:42.564
You know that!

37:43.913 --> 37:45.524
My hands are tied.
Are we clear?

37:45.654 --> 37:48.048
Go back inside,
figure out what you can get!

37:59.277 --> 38:00.365
What?

38:03.019 --> 38:04.412
Do you think
it's hopeless?

38:07.720 --> 38:11.376
No. I think
there's still some hope.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.123
I spoke to some
of our neighbors today.

38:20.254 --> 38:23.605
They won't even step foot
in the city anymore.

38:23.736 --> 38:27.043
Everyone's just waiting
for the next explosions.

38:27.174 --> 38:29.568
It's scary.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.004
The only break I get
from the news

38:31.134 --> 38:33.136
is when Adam watches
his cartoons.

38:35.051 --> 38:36.531
We're gonna catch him.

38:38.664 --> 38:41.319
What, you don't believe me?

38:41.449 --> 38:43.582
- Hmm?

38:50.676 --> 38:53.374
I hope
you catch this guy...

38:53.505 --> 38:55.507
and get back to us, okay?

39:29.018 --> 39:30.106
Avi!

39:30.237 --> 39:31.499
What the fuck?

39:32.500 --> 39:34.284
What the fuck
you doin' here? What--?

39:34.415 --> 39:36.156
-  Huh?
- Get in.

39:36.286 --> 39:39.551
- What are you doin' here?!
- Inside, inside.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.944
Are you out
of your fucking mind? Huh?

39:42.075 --> 39:43.293
What are you doin' here?

39:43.424 --> 39:44.686
Came to check
on your progress.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.427
You could've called.

39:46.558 --> 39:50.257
Well, I want to be here
when you find him.
You understand?

39:50.388 --> 39:51.650
Any luck?

39:51.780 --> 39:54.392
- Not yet.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.482
I don't know
how you two got here, but, uh,

39:57.612 --> 40:00.920
I suggest you use
the same means to go
to Tel Aviv...

40:01.050 --> 40:03.401
where the sight
of two Americans
won't be as, uh,

40:03.531 --> 40:05.925
complicated
if you get caught.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.883
I understand what you're saying
and appreciate it,

40:08.014 --> 40:09.319
but we're not in Gaza,
are we?

40:09.450 --> 40:12.018
- Oh, in Gaza.
- I've made my decision.

40:12.148 --> 40:16.370
I want you to bring
the man responsible to me.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.112
I want to look him in the eyes,
and I want to shoot him myself.

40:19.242 --> 40:21.636
And I promise you,
we will find him.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.333
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

40:23.464 --> 40:26.336
He's gonna pay
for whatever he's done.
For what he did.

40:29.165 --> 40:30.471
What don't you
understand?!

40:30.602 --> 40:32.081
Get your asses out of here.

40:32.212 --> 40:34.127
- Gili...
- The old man is right.

40:34.257 --> 40:36.564
They're gonna get killed
out here, or worse,
get us killed.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.348
Look. They want to stay,
they're gonna stay.

40:38.479 --> 40:42.657
If you don't care
about your life, fine.

40:42.788 --> 40:45.443
But coming here right now,
this is insane.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.881
But you bringing him?

40:49.011 --> 40:51.013
You're not only
endangering his life,

40:51.144 --> 40:53.015
but you're risking my life
and theirs.

40:55.931 --> 40:57.237
You are not only
in a different country,

40:57.367 --> 40:59.587
you're in a completely
fucking different world,

40:59.718 --> 41:01.676
filled with people
that have lost
a lot more than--

41:01.807 --> 41:04.113
With all due respect, gentlemen,

41:04.244 --> 41:07.813
I was in Vietnam
when your asses were still
getting wiped by your parents.

41:07.943 --> 41:10.772
All right? I'm well aware
of the dangers.

41:10.903 --> 41:12.208
Vietnam.

41:12.339 --> 41:14.080
Do you have a little orange
juice or something?

41:14.210 --> 41:16.386
- Yeah, we have water
in the fridge.
- Water in the fridge.

41:16.517 --> 41:18.911
- Henry, please...
- If someone--
listen, listen.

41:19.041 --> 41:22.175
If the phone rings,
don't answer.

41:22.305 --> 41:23.916
If there's a knock
on the door, don't--

41:24.046 --> 41:25.657
just don't fuckin' breathe.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.136
Goddamnit.

41:30.226 --> 41:34.274
<i>News in Jerusalem.
We were told that a-a bomb
exploded on board a bus.</i>

41:34.404 --> 41:36.406
<i>Uh, seems to be a bit
of conflicting information</i>

41:36.537 --> 41:38.321
<i>as to whether or not
there was a bomb on board a bus</i>

41:38.452 --> 41:40.846
<i>or nearby a telephone pole.
Uh, but bear this in mind:</i>

41:40.976 --> 41:42.804
<i>- when all the news of Libya...
-</i>

41:42.935 --> 41:44.763
<i>...was crossing
about five days ago,</i>

41:44.893 --> 41:48.506
<i>- Hamas fired several rockets
into southern Israel.</i>
- Hello?

41:48.636 --> 41:50.290
- Yes, sir.
<i>- The Israelis,
in turn, responded.</i>

41:50.420 --> 41:52.727
<i>- Perhaps this is
retaliation for that.</i>
- Thank you, sir.

41:52.858 --> 41:54.947
<i>- Uh, as we sort through all
the information...
- Okay.</i>

41:55.077 --> 41:57.210
<i>...we're getting right now,
Reena Ninan's by telephone.</i>

41:57.340 --> 42:00.082
<i>You're in Jerusalem, Reena.
What have you found out
about this?</i>

42:00.213 --> 42:01.954
- What's goin' on?
<i>- Bill, this explosion...</i>

42:02.084 --> 42:04.086
Another bombing
in Jerusalem,
five minutes ago.

42:04.217 --> 42:07.742
<i>That's the main bus hub,
right at the entrance
of Jerusalem...</i>

42:07.873 --> 42:09.788
Good news is, you've got
the green light.

42:11.180 --> 42:12.878
You can push harder now.

42:16.098 --> 42:18.840
<i>They don't believe
it was a suicide bomber--</i>

42:26.544 --> 42:27.632
How did Alina look?

42:27.762 --> 42:29.242
Angry.

42:30.635 --> 42:31.810
She looked beautiful.

42:33.289 --> 42:34.552
If you want it,
it will happen.

42:34.682 --> 42:36.205
Oh, yeah.

42:36.336 --> 42:38.077
That's our target.

42:38.207 --> 42:40.558
- Khader Tarik Kassim.

42:40.688 --> 42:41.733
That's good.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.043
- Hey...

42:48.174 --> 42:52.004
- Is he there?
-  <i>Khader's address
is 2563 Kadesh Road.</i>

42:52.134 --> 42:53.788
-  Bye.

42:56.051 --> 42:57.618
Let's go.

43:00.752 --> 43:01.709
Take the key.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.244
Don't fucking move.

43:23.035 --> 43:24.471
Khader Tarik Kassim?

43:31.086 --> 43:32.174
Levi,
bring me a chair.

44:17.263 --> 44:20.527
He went
to your children's room. Hm?

44:27.099 --> 44:29.057
When I ring this bell...

44:31.146 --> 44:33.235
...he will slit
their throats.

44:33.366 --> 44:35.107
One ring, one child.

44:39.415 --> 44:41.635
- After two rings...

44:41.766 --> 44:43.115
...he's gonna go to your room.

44:52.733 --> 44:54.213
Where's the Engineer?

45:10.620 --> 45:11.970
Hey...

45:14.842 --> 45:17.323
You smuggle for him. Yes?

45:17.453 --> 45:19.238
He doesn't know.

45:32.207 --> 45:34.644
But there's
someone who doesn't change
his place.

45:34.775 --> 45:36.037
Who?

45:36.168 --> 45:37.212
<i>Meen?</i>

45:50.748 --> 45:52.706
Love makes us make
stupid things,

45:52.837 --> 45:54.273
- but there's a rumor.
- What rumor?

45:55.665 --> 45:56.841
Hey! Hey!

46:04.587 --> 46:05.850
What rumor?

46:27.045 --> 46:29.699
His wife,
she's pregnant.

46:29.830 --> 46:32.485
Is he really that stupid?

46:36.054 --> 46:37.490
Khader.

46:38.796 --> 46:39.666
Good.

47:15.571 --> 47:16.834
<i>Yallah...</i>

47:19.314 --> 47:20.838
Let's go.

47:35.113 --> 47:37.158
You wanna talk?

47:37.289 --> 47:38.856
Why don't you
just talk, hm?

47:43.121 --> 47:44.862
- Talk!

47:46.124 --> 47:48.561
School friend...

47:48.691 --> 47:51.999
a child is coming...

47:52.130 --> 47:54.784
the martyrs, they don't...

47:54.915 --> 47:59.006
the martyrs, they...
they don't...

47:59.137 --> 48:01.052
You gotta start making sense

48:01.182 --> 48:03.054
or I'm gonna start
breaking bones.

48:03.184 --> 48:05.839
- Okay?

48:05.970 --> 48:07.797
Do you want
to fucking die?! Huh?

48:07.928 --> 48:09.408
You don't think
I'll fucking do it?!

48:09.538 --> 48:11.192
Where is Ayyash?!

48:11.323 --> 48:12.367
Where is Ayyash?!

48:12.498 --> 48:14.369
Where is Ayyash?!

48:19.722 --> 48:20.941
C'mon!

48:24.336 --> 48:27.078
- Right now, tell us!
Tell us what we wanna know!

48:42.180 --> 48:44.965
I delivered a device
to my operative.

48:46.314 --> 48:48.055
A vest.

48:48.186 --> 48:50.840
- A bomb.
- Yes...

48:50.971 --> 48:54.540
with instructions
to choose a bus at random.

48:54.670 --> 48:57.369
Okay. Who gave you
the instructions?

49:01.721 --> 49:03.375
Ayyash.

49:03.505 --> 49:05.551
The Engineer?

49:05.681 --> 49:08.206
Yes.

49:08.336 --> 49:11.731
He teaches others
how to do it,
how to make bombs.

49:13.646 --> 49:17.998
Teaching where?
Where is he?

49:28.617 --> 49:30.010
He doesn't know.

49:30.141 --> 49:31.881
What do you mean,
"He doesn't know?"

49:32.012 --> 49:33.883
Of course he knows.
Keep goin'.

49:34.014 --> 49:37.626
If I keep going,
he's gonna end up telling us
that he is Ayyash.

49:40.107 --> 49:41.848
He doesn't know.

49:50.552 --> 49:52.728
And? Did he crack?

49:52.859 --> 49:55.731
- Crack?

49:57.646 --> 49:59.300
Looks like
he fucking exploded.

49:59.431 --> 50:00.736
We're back
to square nothing.

50:02.042 --> 50:04.610
He's teaching them
how to make bombs.

50:04.740 --> 50:06.655
Well, that's
something. Right?

50:06.786 --> 50:08.440
No, without a "where,"
it's nothing.

50:10.572 --> 50:12.444
He said
someone's pregnant.

50:12.574 --> 50:14.098
You mean,
when he was half-conscious?

50:14.228 --> 50:16.752
Do we still have eyes
on the wife's house?

50:16.883 --> 50:19.712
The wife's house
has been really quiet.

50:19.842 --> 50:21.018
No way he's going
back there.

50:21.148 --> 50:23.455
The only thing
he cares about is there.

50:30.288 --> 50:31.593
- Hello?

50:34.596 --> 50:37.121
How are you doing,
my jewel?

50:37.251 --> 50:40.385
<i>I'm feeling pregnant.
And alone.</i>

50:46.608 --> 50:48.697
Look out your window.

50:48.828 --> 50:50.482
Do you see the moon?

50:51.613 --> 50:53.876
<i>Yes, I see the moon.</i>

50:54.007 --> 50:57.489
Looking right now
at the same moon.

50:57.619 --> 51:01.493
I'm close,
and we will be
together soon.

51:01.623 --> 51:05.453
<i>We will always be with you.
You know that.</i>

51:05.584 --> 51:07.499
I love you.

51:07.629 --> 51:09.066
<i>I love you.</i>

51:20.555 --> 51:21.817
You came back.

51:21.948 --> 51:23.819
And I told you I would.

51:23.950 --> 51:26.431
Mom said
you're not staying long.

51:27.867 --> 51:30.739
There's, um...

51:30.870 --> 51:34.613
I have to do
this... thing.

51:36.136 --> 51:39.096
Is this "thing"
related to the attacks?

51:41.359 --> 51:43.535
You shouldn't be worried
about any of that stuff.

51:43.665 --> 51:45.450
You're a kid.

51:45.580 --> 51:46.538
I'm 13.

51:46.668 --> 51:48.192
Oh.

51:49.193 --> 51:51.760
And the most beautiful
13-year-old girl

51:51.891 --> 51:54.328
in the whole wide world.

51:54.459 --> 51:56.417
You've been gone
a long time.

52:00.291 --> 52:01.509
Did your mom tell you?

52:02.684 --> 52:04.512
Mom doesn't lie to me.

52:06.079 --> 52:07.167
What did she tell you?

52:07.298 --> 52:09.865
That you got
into trouble at work,

52:09.996 --> 52:11.780
that you pissed off
the wrong people,

52:11.911 --> 52:15.741
and that a US Senator
had to step in
to clean up your mess.

52:15.871 --> 52:18.352
I guess that we were
part of that mess, too.

52:19.658 --> 52:21.138
No, no, no.

52:23.575 --> 52:26.186
You were never
part of any mess.

52:26.317 --> 52:27.274
I needed you to be safe.

52:27.405 --> 52:29.102
I needed you to be here.

52:32.061 --> 52:33.280
I know.

52:37.980 --> 52:39.156
You know
that I love you.

52:40.896 --> 52:42.985
I know...

52:44.987 --> 52:46.163
I know.

52:57.043 --> 53:00.612
His heart is
in the right place.

53:00.742 --> 53:02.440
His heart's
gonna get him killed.

53:04.137 --> 53:06.835
Just shake the hands,
you have peace.

53:06.966 --> 53:08.315
If only it were that easy, huh?

53:10.187 --> 53:11.579
I don't trust this guy.

53:11.710 --> 53:13.320
We have to.

53:26.899 --> 53:28.640
- Hey.

53:35.864 --> 53:36.996
Where'd you go?

53:41.870 --> 53:43.350
I went to see them.

53:45.439 --> 53:46.614
I told you they're safe.

53:48.529 --> 53:50.879
By doing what you did,
you're-you're ensuring
the opposite.

53:51.010 --> 53:52.620
David, please...

53:55.406 --> 53:57.146
I wanted to say goodbye.

53:58.844 --> 54:01.629
If you don't get him alive...
I want proof.

54:01.760 --> 54:04.153
- You want proof of what?
- Proof that you got him.

54:06.417 --> 54:07.592
Look around you.

54:09.289 --> 54:11.552
This is a regular Tuesday
for us. Look.

54:11.683 --> 54:13.859
<i>...recited by Jews daily...</i>

54:13.989 --> 54:16.905
This country's ready
to blow up on its own.

54:17.036 --> 54:19.081
I have to know, Avi.

54:19.212 --> 54:21.432
Keep watching the news.
You'll know.

54:37.665 --> 54:38.971
Call.

54:41.713 --> 54:44.455
Well... the problem is
we're playing cards

54:44.585 --> 54:46.935
when we should be
playing chess.

54:47.066 --> 54:48.285
Fold.

54:50.330 --> 54:54.334
There's no strategy involved
in these attacks.

54:54.465 --> 54:58.120
The targets are random.

54:58.251 --> 55:00.471
The bombs may be sophisticated,

55:00.601 --> 55:03.865
but we're dealing
with a madman.

55:05.650 --> 55:07.129
So, how do we stop him?

55:10.176 --> 55:12.178
We need to think
like madmen.

55:12.309 --> 55:15.399
No, we must become madmen.

55:15.529 --> 55:18.010
- C'mon. Fuck!
-  Please.

55:18.140 --> 55:20.404
- We got a visitor!
- What?

55:20.534 --> 55:22.580
Is it him? Who is it?

55:22.710 --> 55:24.059
I couldn't tell.

55:24.190 --> 55:25.757
- Do you get eyes
on the back door?
- No.

55:25.887 --> 55:27.106
We gotta get out there.

55:27.236 --> 55:29.064
We gotta get eyes on him.
Come on, guys!

55:40.337 --> 55:41.425
Hey.

55:57.789 --> 55:59.181
-  I've missed you.
- Oh!

56:44.575 --> 56:47.882
- Get down! Down, down, down!
Where is he?!

56:48.013 --> 56:49.101
Where's Ayyash?

56:49.231 --> 56:50.972
I'm gonna check
in the back!

56:51.103 --> 56:52.974
- Eli, what do you got? You got
anything back there?
- Nothing.

56:53.105 --> 56:54.411
All right.
Let's go to the back.

57:09.208 --> 57:11.993
Tamas...
you go that way.

57:12.124 --> 57:14.256
Eli, you go that way.

57:42.502 --> 57:44.286
Okay. Get back
to the safehouse.

57:44.417 --> 57:46.941
He knows
we're tracking him.

57:47.072 --> 57:49.074
He's gonna go straight
into the shadows now.

57:49.204 --> 57:51.816
Fuck! Fucking rat.

58:30.158 --> 58:31.812
Guys, something's happening.

58:31.943 --> 58:33.205
What is it, Fanni?

58:34.511 --> 58:36.164
She's got visitors.

58:37.644 --> 58:40.212
Maybe they're moving her.

58:40.342 --> 58:42.997
We were just there.

58:43.128 --> 58:45.739
All right. We're gonna
head back there right now.

58:53.573 --> 58:56.576
-  What happened?
-  Surveillance cameras
all around.

58:56.707 --> 58:58.578
-  Shabak.
-  Fuck.

59:01.276 --> 59:02.930
-  Probably.
-  Yeah.

59:07.500 --> 59:11.635
-  Where have you been?
-  Yeah? Right here.

59:11.765 --> 59:14.333
You went
to the redhead again?

59:19.077 --> 59:21.514
<i>Fanni,
we're on their tail.</i>

59:21.645 --> 59:22.863
<i>We're following them.</i>

59:54.068 --> 59:55.504
What happened?

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:04.731
- What's goin' on?
- I need a moment to think.

01:00:07.299 --> 01:00:09.083
If they're watching the wife,
she's a dead end.

01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:10.476
How do you know?

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.391
'Cause they would've
had him already.

01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:16.134
Ugh, if she's pregnant,

01:00:16.264 --> 01:00:17.788
he'd at least
be calling there, right?

01:00:17.918 --> 01:00:19.703
Yeah.

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:23.315
The kid's right.
She has to know something.

01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:34.108
Okay, we can do
a sweep in the morning,

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:35.849
see if they have
any blind spots.

01:00:37.111 --> 01:00:38.678
We gotta find a way
into the house.

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:41.202
- Down, down, down, down!

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.639
Everybody get
the fuck down!

01:00:42.769 --> 01:00:45.293
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:52.039
Gili... they're with us.

01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:58.524
How are you, Etan?

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:01.396
It's fucking Avi?

01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:06.401
Is this
fucking necessary? Huh?

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:10.188
You tell me.

01:01:10.318 --> 01:01:11.842
We're on the same side.

01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:13.887
Are we?

01:01:14.018 --> 01:01:15.584
We're losing time.

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:16.977
What do you think
I'm doing here?

01:01:17.108 --> 01:01:19.763
Again, you tell me.

01:01:19.893 --> 01:01:21.982
Tell me
what you're doin' here, Avi.

01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:24.332
Right outside Gaza
with a US Senator?

01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:26.552
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:31.862
His daughter
was on the bus in Dizengoff.

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:34.081
If-if I could...

01:01:34.212 --> 01:01:36.301
Permit me for a second now...

01:01:36.431 --> 01:01:38.869
My name is
Senator David Adler.

01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:41.219
And, uh...

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:42.916
as he said, my daughter
was on the bus

01:01:43.047 --> 01:01:46.703
when this...
uh, gentleman...

01:01:48.008 --> 01:01:49.140
Anyway...

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:54.232
I engaged Avi...

01:01:54.362 --> 01:01:57.714
to, uh, to get
that son of a bitch.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.066
He asked me
if I could do something.

01:02:02.196 --> 01:02:04.633
Asked you?

01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:06.374
Now, what did you think
you could do?

01:02:06.505 --> 01:02:08.333
Ayyash's wife.

01:02:10.552 --> 01:02:12.076
She's pregnant again.

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:17.777
You're tellin' me Yehia Ayyash--
the Engineer's wife,
is pregnant?

01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:19.039
Exactly.

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.911
How?

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:23.609
If we have to explain to you
how babies are made,

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.132
then we'll have
to spend here all day.

01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:27.134
We have the house
under constant surveillance.

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:30.485
Well, maybe he found a way
to get into his house

01:02:30.616 --> 01:02:33.619
and into his wife
without you knowing.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.490
Maybe they're meeting
somewhere else.

01:02:35.621 --> 01:02:37.057
She knows where he is.

01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:38.493
Maybe, but she won't talk,

01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:40.800
and there are some lines
even I won't cross.

01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:45.631
Eli, take the senator
and his man
back to headquarters with Fanni.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.547
I would appreciate
if you did not, uh,

01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:50.854
involve any other authority.

01:02:50.984 --> 01:02:52.856
I'm here
under my own jurisdiction,

01:02:52.986 --> 01:02:55.032
no government instruction.

01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:58.426
Right now, I'd appreciate it
if you stopped talking.

01:02:58.557 --> 01:03:00.559
We're gonna take you back
to Tel Aviv

01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:02.430
where we are gonna decide
what to do with you.

01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:03.867
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

01:03:03.997 --> 01:03:06.391
Okay. So, let's take him
to the airport.

01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:09.220
As far as I'm concerned,
you both owe me.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.788
He's right, David.

01:03:11.918 --> 01:03:14.791
Go home.
It's safer there.

01:03:14.921 --> 01:03:17.489
Well, now we're gonna get
out of this room
and onto the street,

01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:20.927
find any informants we can,
shake 'em down,
see what falls out.

01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:22.799
What about them?

01:03:25.758 --> 01:03:28.761
Well, they're gonna
help us now.
Right, Avi?

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:32.330
Etan... we're real close.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.201
Good. I hope you're right.

01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:37.117
Tamas, uncuff 'em.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:43.254
<i>Truly shocking news
from the Middle East tonight.</i>

01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:45.386
<i>Israel's prime minister,
Yitzhak Rabin,</i>

01:03:45.517 --> 01:03:47.388
<i>- has been assassinated.</i>

01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:52.916
<i>An evening spent
dreaming of peace turns into
a national nightmare.</i>

01:03:58.095 --> 01:04:01.750
<i>The assassin has taken
yet another world leader
away from us.</i>

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:05.145
<i>It was just after the biggest
peace rally in Tel Aviv...</i>

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:09.062
Prime Minister Rabin
wanted peace most of all.

01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:14.546
As do I, as do all of you.

01:04:14.676 --> 01:04:19.159
But the change
that needs to be made

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.944
is not an easy one.

01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:25.426
There will be more blood.

01:04:25.557 --> 01:04:27.559
There will be more war.

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:32.433
But we will bring about change.

01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:35.175
And we'll attain it.

01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:38.483
I truly believe this.

01:04:38.613 --> 01:04:41.138
This "engineer..."

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.057
I don't want you to capture him.

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:50.190
This man is a symbol.

01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:54.238
With every bomb goes off,

01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:57.241
a message is sent to our people

01:04:57.371 --> 01:05:01.201
that their safety
cannot be guaranteed,

01:05:01.332 --> 01:05:03.508
their lives cannot be protected.

01:05:05.336 --> 01:05:09.862
Well, it's time to send
a message of our own.

01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:12.604
Yes, sir.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:19.306
Hamas is a snake
with many heads.

01:05:19.437 --> 01:05:22.483
We cut off these heads,

01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:24.921
and the beast will fall!

01:05:42.808 --> 01:05:44.810
I hope it's in your liking.

01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:51.991
You will have
complete privacy here.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.345
And if you need anything,

01:05:58.476 --> 01:06:01.479
anything, just ask me
and I will bring for you.

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:03.742
I like it.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:13.273
Osama...

01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:16.450
what I need
is your discretion.

01:06:16.581 --> 01:06:18.235
Of course.

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:20.977
And a phone.

01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:23.805
Okay.
I will bring for you.

01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:25.111
Your phone.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.419
Okay.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.423
You need anything?

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.167
Osama...

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.997
- Thank you.
- It's pleasure.

01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:48.004
<i>Yallah. Salam alaikum.</i>

01:06:53.618 --> 01:06:55.620
<i>Wa alaikum assalam.</i>

01:06:57.883 --> 01:07:02.583
This tenant was so crazy,
asking all of this weird stuff.

01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:05.934
Wow,
what a stressy week.

01:07:07.632 --> 01:07:09.242
Osama?

01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:10.504
Nephew, what is it?

01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:11.940
What are you
so stressed about?

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:16.510
A tenant, he is
requesting a phone.

01:07:17.816 --> 01:07:18.947
What tenant?

01:07:20.688 --> 01:07:22.386
I can't say.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.217
Okay, okay, I will say.

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:29.610
But I need
your discretion, Uncle.

01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:31.612
Osama,
is it a girl again?

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:34.876
No, no.
It's an old classmate.

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:39.359
- And he pays?
- Yes.

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:42.101
<i>Tayyib,</i> it doesn't matter.
A classmate, not classmate,

01:07:42.232 --> 01:07:44.886
a boy, a girl. But why
are you so stressed?

01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:51.632
It's him.

01:07:53.634 --> 01:07:55.158
Who's him? What him?

01:07:57.073 --> 01:08:00.293
The Engineer.
It's him.

01:08:04.297 --> 01:08:05.994
Ayyash?

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:09.737
I told you.
We were in the same class.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.787
You're certain it's him?

01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:29.888
<i>Tayyib.</i>

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.850
It has to be here somewhere.

01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:38.897
You're turning the place
upside down for a hunch?

01:08:39.027 --> 01:08:40.420
It's all
we have left, okay?

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:43.118
Look, we need
to rethink this.

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:46.513
Issa wasn't lying
about Ayyash's wife
being pregnant.

01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:49.386
- So?
- So, he mentioned
a school friend, okay?

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:51.692
There has
to be a connection.

01:08:51.823 --> 01:08:54.216
You gave him
fucking brain damage.
All right?

01:08:54.346 --> 01:08:56.044
We've been over everything.

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:59.135
His schoolmates either seem
to be dead or better off dead.

01:08:59.265 --> 01:09:01.354
What about this guy, Osama?

01:09:01.484 --> 01:09:03.921
He was at least
in the same class as Ayyash.

01:09:05.706 --> 01:09:06.968
Look who his uncle is.

01:09:09.274 --> 01:09:12.756
Okay. It was a good hunch.

01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:24.856
Taking our <i>keffiyahs,</i>

01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:26.162
armed to the teeth.

01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:27.466
It's just
like old times, huh?

01:09:27.598 --> 01:09:29.207
Yeah. You know,
no bullshit?

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:32.863
Our years in the Mossad were
some of the best of my life.

01:09:32.993 --> 01:09:36.127
Maybe when we get home,

01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:37.825
when we're done,

01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:41.612
- get a few beers,
grab the <i>mangala.
-</i> Oh, maybe.

01:09:41.742 --> 01:09:44.091
It depends if your grilling
has improved or not, though.

01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:50.316
Appreciate you...
letting us join the fight.

01:09:51.796 --> 01:09:53.406
This is
all our fight, brother.

01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:56.801
Yeah.

01:10:26.874 --> 01:10:30.661
Hello, Kamal.
Don't fucking move.

01:10:33.098 --> 01:10:35.143
What do you want?

01:10:36.797 --> 01:10:38.495
Information.

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:41.672
I don't have any!

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:43.761
I have rooms, if you want.

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:45.632
I have five available.

01:10:47.678 --> 01:10:49.680
You're very popular, Kamal.

01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:54.162
I have my reputation.

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:56.164
How many wives
do you got, Kamal?

01:10:58.471 --> 01:11:01.909
Please... I know nothing.

01:11:09.134 --> 01:11:11.136
But perhaps if you
can give me something...

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:14.792
I can give you something.

01:11:16.881 --> 01:11:18.099
What do you want?

01:11:19.492 --> 01:11:21.538
Money?

01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:25.150
Israeli papers,
for me and my wives?

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:28.414
Why don't you start
with telling us

01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:30.155
this "something"
that you think you know,

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.809
and we'll make sure
that nobody knows

01:11:31.939 --> 01:11:34.681
that you're friends
with the Shin Bet?

01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:37.771
W-we're not friends!

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:41.732
Well, I mean,
we can let your people
decide what we are.

01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:45.083
And just think of what that
will do to your reputation.

01:11:51.959 --> 01:11:54.005
Please. Y-you will have
to promise me

01:11:54.135 --> 01:11:58.226
that nothing will happen
for-for me or to my family!

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.361
You'll be safe.

01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:04.189
Mm-hmm.

01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:09.107
You and your wives.

01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:17.550
He's here.

01:12:38.528 --> 01:12:41.139
<i>You have to get us
his phone.</i>

01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:45.578
- What for?
- Surveillance.

01:12:48.059 --> 01:12:51.323
<i>Please, I don't want
to cause him any harm.</i>

01:12:51.454 --> 01:12:53.978
<i>Not to him, not to my nephew,
and not to myself.</i>

01:12:54.108 --> 01:12:55.458
<i>No, no.</i>

01:13:00.245 --> 01:13:03.683
Okay, I will do this.
But only this.

01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:05.990
Okay. Okay,
great. Great.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.731
Avi! Tamas!

01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:09.863
Come on in here.
Keep an eye on him.

01:13:15.565 --> 01:13:18.655
<i>We plant a bomb
in the phone.</i>

01:13:18.785 --> 01:13:22.485
<i>The next time he gets a call
from his father, we detonate.</i>

01:13:22.615 --> 01:13:24.704
We gotta confirm
that it's him first.

01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:27.272
We'll get a sample
of his voice beforehand.

01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:32.538
Etan, Fanni's on it.

01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:35.019
We'll get a confirmation
of his voice,

01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:36.847
and I'll get back to you.

01:13:36.977 --> 01:13:38.588
-  <i>Eli, Etan's
bringing you a phone.</i>

01:13:38.718 --> 01:13:40.894
<i>You have about 45 minutes
to put a bomb in it.</i>

01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:23.459
Okay...

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:25.548
Now...

01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:28.725
in order for us
to make sure
that we record him,

01:14:28.855 --> 01:14:31.467
you gotta make sure
that he answers this phone

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:34.252
and this phone only.
Okay?

01:14:36.123 --> 01:14:39.605
Do you want me to cut the line
of the phone in his apartment?

01:14:39.736 --> 01:14:41.041
Yeah, that's perfect.

01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:51.487
What happened to your room?

01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:53.184
I have lost it.

01:14:53.314 --> 01:14:54.402
What, your mind?

01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:56.579
My phone.

01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:58.015
It must be here somewhere.

01:14:58.145 --> 01:15:00.365
I have looked everywhere.
It's hopeless.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.498
Look for it over there,
maybe you will find it.

01:15:03.934 --> 01:15:07.590
It's hopeless.
I have failed him.

01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:11.507
Ah! There it is.

01:15:18.165 --> 01:15:19.950
It was here on the floor.

01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:25.042
- You saved me, Uncle.

01:15:25.172 --> 01:15:26.870
I'm forever in your debt.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.655
<i>You're always
in my debt.</i>

01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:48.848
Who is it?

01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:50.546
Osama.

01:15:55.899 --> 01:15:57.596
<i>- Salam alaikum.</i>
- Come in.

01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:03.036
I bring you your phone.

01:16:06.823 --> 01:16:09.260
- Thank you, Osama.

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:10.740
You okay?

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.003
Yes. <i>Alhamdullilah.</i>

01:16:13.133 --> 01:16:15.005
<i>Yallah. Salam alaikum.</i>

01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:26.407
It would've been great to have
some eyes inside the building,

01:16:26.538 --> 01:16:28.148
but we'll make do.

01:16:30.411 --> 01:16:32.370
So now, we wait.

01:16:57.482 --> 01:16:59.745
Fanni, we're here.
Are you ready?

01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:00.877
<i>Ready.</i>

01:17:08.798 --> 01:17:09.886
It's him.

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:12.062
<i>Hello?</i>

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:13.846
How are you, my son?

01:17:13.977 --> 01:17:17.633
<i>I apologize
for calling you so early.</i>

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.028
- It's him.
<i>- Everything is fine.</i>

01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:26.119
Aiwa. <i>I miss you, my son.</i>

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.904
<i>It's him.</i>

01:17:37.565 --> 01:17:39.219
Must've been very scary.

01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:45.835
Do it.

01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:51.667
Do you want to tell me about it?

01:17:58.456 --> 01:18:00.153
Didn't work.

01:18:02.112 --> 01:18:03.374
It didn't work.

01:18:04.636 --> 01:18:05.811
What do you mean,
"didn't work"?

01:18:05.942 --> 01:18:08.814
I-I-I don't understand.

01:18:08.945 --> 01:18:10.642
Let's just go in
and take him out, Avi.

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:14.124
We need to get
that phone back.

01:18:16.517 --> 01:18:17.736
What happened, Eli?

01:18:17.867 --> 01:18:19.520
I'm not sure.
It could have been anything.

01:18:21.784 --> 01:18:25.483
Um, I-I can tell you
once we get our hands on it.

01:18:27.137 --> 01:18:29.052
- Do it.

01:18:32.098 --> 01:18:33.534
Fuck!

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:35.972
How do we get it back?

01:18:36.102 --> 01:18:38.714
We can't risk
the uncle getting caught.

01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:40.585
<i>I have an idea.
So let's see if Kamal</i>

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.630
<i>can take Osama
on a helicopter ride.</i>

01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:44.676
<i>Cell phones are not allowed
on helicopters.</i>

01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:46.722
<i>We do not want to go
into his location.</i>

01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:57.341
Eli's right.
We need to bring it back.

01:18:57.471 --> 01:19:00.648
Okay, so we get it back.

01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:02.825
- We better get it back.
- We get it back!

01:19:02.955 --> 01:19:04.609
Fuck!

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.525
Let's do it.
Let's do it!

01:19:07.655 --> 01:19:08.787
<i>Yallah,</i> Gili.

01:19:10.963 --> 01:19:12.399
I'm sorry, guys.

01:19:14.401 --> 01:19:16.186
<i>- Salam alaikum.
- Wa alaikum as-salam.</i>

01:19:16.316 --> 01:19:18.841
- Mr. Hamad?
<i>- Aiwa.</i> Please, come in.

01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:22.409
Welcome.
How are you?

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:23.846
I'm good.
How are you?

01:19:23.976 --> 01:19:26.936
Wonderful. Um, please,
grab something to eat.

01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:29.068
Thanks.
Perhaps when we return?

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:31.897
Because, uh, helicopters
and full stomachs

01:19:32.028 --> 01:19:33.159
don't go
really well together.

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:35.074
Oh, yes, yes.

01:19:35.205 --> 01:19:37.511
And, uh, your nephew?
Is he still coming?

01:19:37.642 --> 01:19:39.513
Eh, yes. Just a second.

01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:42.734
Osama!

01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:47.826
<i>Etan, here's the plan.</i>

01:19:47.957 --> 01:19:49.610
<i>They're on the way
to the heliport.</i>

01:19:49.741 --> 01:19:51.090
<i>You stay close.</i>

01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:53.614
<i>Eli, you go to the airport,
grab the phone.</i>

01:19:53.745 --> 01:19:55.268
<i>You're gonna have
about a half an hour.</i>

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:04.669
Um, I'm sorry,
but no electronics
allowed in a helicopter.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.453
I need your phones.

01:20:09.369 --> 01:20:11.284
You'll get it back
when we return.

01:20:11.415 --> 01:20:13.199
Don't worry.

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.593
And your phone.

01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:35.134
Yes, Fanni?

01:20:35.265 --> 01:20:37.267
We have someone
leaving the house.

01:20:37.397 --> 01:20:38.746
I cannot get an ID.

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:41.662
This could be anyone.

01:20:41.793 --> 01:20:43.316
All right,
let's get a closer look.

01:20:43.447 --> 01:20:44.840
- Finally.
- C'mon, let's go.

01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:46.798
Step on it.
<i>Yallah, yallah!</i>

01:20:58.027 --> 01:20:59.115
Is it him?

01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:05.599
It's not him...

01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:06.949
It's not him.

01:21:07.079 --> 01:21:09.690
Hey, let's get outta here.
C'mon, c'mon.

01:21:21.311 --> 01:21:22.747
- Thanks.

01:21:55.562 --> 01:21:56.389
Right.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.652
There it is.

01:21:58.783 --> 01:22:01.220
Be very careful with it,
though, okay?

01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:02.918
Easy. Slowly.

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.355
Slowly, yeah.

01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:19.760
Hello.

01:22:30.902 --> 01:22:31.990
Fanni, what's going on?

01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:33.992
<i>Where is everyone?</i>

01:22:34.123 --> 01:22:36.560
<i>We thought we saw Ayyash.
Etan and the others
went after him.</i>

01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:38.170
- Was it him?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

01:22:38.301 --> 01:22:40.172
- Wasn't him, wasn't him.
- I know, I know, I know!

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.262
Okay, where is everyone?

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:50.313
They're heading back
to the apartment building.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:59.017
Yes! You enjoyed it, nephew?

01:22:59.148 --> 01:23:01.367
- This was amazing. Yes!
- Yes?

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.030
- It's ringing.
- Okay.

01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:13.858
<i>It's ringing.</i>

01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:20.952
- One day, if you work
hard as me--

01:23:22.171 --> 01:23:24.086
One moment. Hello?

01:23:24.216 --> 01:23:25.304
<i>Ayyash?</i>

01:23:26.436 --> 01:23:29.004
Okay, okay.
I must go.

01:23:30.962 --> 01:23:33.791
Fanni, get the Senator
on the phone.

01:23:37.447 --> 01:23:39.797
- Hello?
-  <i>Listen, Senator.
Hold on.</i>

01:23:39.927 --> 01:23:41.146
Stay with us.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:45.194
Who is it?

01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:46.456
Osama.

01:23:50.808 --> 01:23:53.245
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yes, father.

01:23:53.376 --> 01:23:56.901
I hope <i>inshallah</i>
to see you soon, my son.

01:24:05.953 --> 01:24:07.781
<i>I know, father.</i>

01:24:07.912 --> 01:24:10.480
<i>- More nightmares?</i>

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.746
We lost him.
I don't have confirmation.

01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:18.140
Do you have eyes on him?

01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:20.011
<i>We don't.</i>

01:24:20.142 --> 01:24:22.970
I don't know
if he's still on the phone.

01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:25.756
Etan, I need a visual
before he disappears on us.

01:24:25.886 --> 01:24:27.497
<i>This'd be the last time
we get him.</i>

01:24:27.627 --> 01:24:29.803
All right, we should be able
to get a clear view of that room

01:24:29.934 --> 01:24:30.935
<i>from the roof over there.</i>

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:33.546
And keep
the engine running.

01:24:33.677 --> 01:24:36.071
Just like old times.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:37.420
All right, go, go, go, go!

01:24:49.736 --> 01:24:52.565
Okay. I'm goin' up.

01:24:52.696 --> 01:24:53.784
I'll stay here.

01:24:53.914 --> 01:24:55.046
All right.

01:25:03.315 --> 01:25:05.970
How is the kids?

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.365
Yes, father.

01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.384
No sign of him yet.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.782
I don't think he's moving.

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:39.612
I know, father. I know.

01:25:43.573 --> 01:25:45.662
It's him.
It's him, it's the Engineer!

01:25:47.533 --> 01:25:48.621
Do it.

01:25:51.711 --> 01:25:54.149
Hello? Hello?

01:25:59.589 --> 01:26:02.026
Hello!
Hello, <i>ya Ayyash!</i>

01:26:17.824 --> 01:26:19.696
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:27:00.737 --> 01:27:02.434
Fuck!

01:27:04.436 --> 01:27:06.090
Gili...

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:10.312
- Etan, what's the status?

01:27:10.442 --> 01:27:12.444
We lost Gili.

01:27:14.838 --> 01:27:18.929
-  Oh, fuck.

01:27:19.059 --> 01:27:22.367
Sara...

01:27:25.457 --> 01:27:26.980
Oh, fuck.

01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:29.505
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

01:27:32.595 --> 01:27:35.162
Fuck! Oh, fuck.

01:27:35.293 --> 01:27:37.730
We lost Avi as well.

01:27:39.297 --> 01:27:44.171
Oh, fuck...
oh, fuck... oh, fuck!

01:27:44.302 --> 01:27:47.610
Oh, fuck...
oh, fuck!

01:27:49.351 --> 01:27:53.224
Oh, fuck,
oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

01:28:07.499 --> 01:28:09.196
That's it.

01:28:17.683 --> 01:28:19.163
Senator...

01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:25.038
It's done. It's over.

01:28:25.169 --> 01:28:28.085
- Hmm.
-  <i>We lost
two good men.</i>

01:28:28.215 --> 01:28:31.567
- Was one of them Avi?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:28:37.224 --> 01:28:38.530
Thank you.
