WEBVTT

00:39.799 --> 00:44.971
In the first years
of the 21 st century...

00:46.640 --> 00:50.393
...a third World War broke out.

00:51.478 --> 00:54.898
Those of us who survived knew

00:54.940 --> 01:01.363
mankind could never survive...

01:01.446 --> 01:04.032
a fourth...

01:04.114 --> 01:07.702
that our own volatile natures

01:07.786 --> 01:12.082
could simply no longer
be risked.

01:13.083 --> 01:17.170
So we have created
a new arm of the law...

01:18.755 --> 01:22.175
...the Grammaton Cleric,

01:22.259 --> 01:27.097
whose sole task it is
to seek out and eradicate

01:27.180 --> 01:32.477
the true source
of man's inhumanity to man.

01:35.105 --> 01:38.942
His ability...

01:39.025 --> 01:40.944
to feel.

01:42.112 --> 01:43.196
Police!

01:58.795 --> 02:00.213
You know what to do.

02:15.478 --> 02:16.521
Get down!

03:03.610 --> 03:05.195
We have an unknown number

03:05.278 --> 03:07.697
barricaded in the southeast end
of the compound.

03:07.781 --> 03:10.200
Read that.
Tetragrammaton team en route.

03:10.283 --> 03:14.329
Cleric, lights out.
Maybe more than a dozen inside.

03:14.371 --> 03:16.790
When the door's down,
blow the bulbs.

03:16.873 --> 03:18.667
Yes, sir.

03:22.879 --> 03:23.838
Go.

04:12.095 --> 04:13.221
Where is he?

04:13.263 --> 04:14.431
Shut up.

04:15.557 --> 04:17.475
Anybody get him?
Did anybody hit him?

04:17.559 --> 04:18.976
Shut up!

04:19.060 --> 04:20.562
Listen.

06:20.056 --> 06:21.182
This is it.

06:21.224 --> 06:22.392
Where?

06:23.977 --> 06:25.979
There.

07:04.726 --> 07:06.561
It's real.

07:12.776 --> 07:14.236
Burn it.

07:54.401 --> 07:55.819
Why didn't you just leave it

07:55.902 --> 07:58.989
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

08:03.660 --> 08:05.829
They miss things sometimes.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.959
And I thought
I'd take it down myself...

08:11.001 --> 08:12.502
get it done properly.

08:16.756 --> 08:21.219
How long, Preston,
till all this is gone?

08:22.846 --> 08:25.640
Till we've burned
every last bit of it?

08:27.017 --> 08:29.019
Resources are tight.

08:31.021 --> 08:33.106
We'll get it all eventually.

08:38.193 --> 08:40.989
Libria...

08:41.030 --> 08:44.326
I congratulate you.

08:44.367 --> 08:46.328
At last...

08:46.369 --> 08:51.166
peace reigns
in the heart of man.

08:51.207 --> 08:54.002
At last, war is but a word

08:54.044 --> 08:57.339
whose meaning fades
from our understanding.

08:57.380 --> 08:59.674
At last...

08:59.716 --> 09:03.887
we... are... whole.

09:11.394 --> 09:16.232
Librians... there is a disease
in the heart of man.

09:17.484 --> 09:19.819
Its symptom is hate.

09:21.071 --> 09:25.283
Its symptom... is anger.

09:25.367 --> 09:29.454
Its symptom is rage.

09:29.537 --> 09:34.459
Its symptom... is war.

09:34.542 --> 09:41.549
The disease... is human emotion.

09:41.591 --> 09:45.720
But, Libria...
I congratulate you.

09:45.762 --> 09:48.181
For there is a cure
for this disease.

09:48.265 --> 09:51.685
At the cost of the dizzying
highs of human emotion,

09:51.768 --> 09:55.897
we have suppressed
its abysmal lows.

09:55.939 --> 10:01.486
And you as a society
have embraced this cure.

10:02.904 --> 10:03.822
Prozium.

10:05.240 --> 10:08.660
Now we are at peace
with ourselves,

10:08.743 --> 10:12.163
and humankind is one.

10:12.247 --> 10:14.165
War is gone.

10:14.249 --> 10:16.876
Hate, a memory.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.838
We are our own conscience now.

10:19.921 --> 10:25.385
And it is this conscience
that guides us to rate EC-10

10:25.468 --> 10:27.637
for emotional content

10:27.721 --> 10:31.891
all those things that might
tempt us to feel again...

10:31.975 --> 10:33.602
and destroy them.

10:33.643 --> 10:36.646
Librians, you have won.

10:36.730 --> 10:41.610
Against all odds
and your own natures...

10:41.651 --> 10:46.031
you have survived.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.262
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

11:09.346 --> 11:12.807
it reminds why we do
what we do.

11:12.891 --> 11:14.017
It does?

11:16.186 --> 11:17.938
I beg your pardon.

11:23.068 --> 11:24.236
It does.

11:37.207 --> 11:40.543
The following items
have been rated EC-10...

11:40.585 --> 11:42.003
condemned...

11:42.045 --> 11:44.923
seven works of two-dimensional
illustrated material,

11:45.006 --> 11:47.592
seven discs of musical content,

11:47.676 --> 11:50.679
20 interactive strategy
computer programs.

11:50.762 --> 11:53.723
Seven works
of two-dimensional...

11:58.853 --> 12:01.106
Thank you
for coming, Cleric.

12:01.189 --> 12:03.108
I assume you know who I am.

12:03.191 --> 12:04.442
Yes, sir. Of course.

12:04.526 --> 12:06.111
You are Vice-Council Dupont

12:06.194 --> 12:08.446
of the Third Conciliarly
of the Tetragrammaton...

12:08.530 --> 12:09.948
Father's voice.

12:10.031 --> 12:11.700
Quite frankly, Cleric,

12:11.741 --> 12:16.496
I am told that you are
very nearly a prodigal student,

12:16.580 --> 12:20.458
knowing almost instantly
if someone is feeling.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.294
I have a good record, sir.

12:22.377 --> 12:25.088
Why, do you imagine,
that is, Cleric?

12:25.171 --> 12:27.674
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.886
Somehow...

12:31.928 --> 12:34.431
I'm able, on some level,

12:34.472 --> 12:38.059
to sense
how an offender thinks,

12:38.101 --> 12:41.980
to... put myself
in their position.

12:43.231 --> 12:47.277
If you had ceased
your interval,

12:47.360 --> 12:50.822
if you were
a sense offender...

12:50.906 --> 12:52.991
I suppose
you could say that, sir.

12:53.074 --> 12:55.410
You're a family man, Cleric?

12:55.452 --> 12:57.162
Yes, sir...
a boy and a girl.

12:57.245 --> 12:59.205
The boy's in
the monastery himself,

12:59.289 --> 13:00.707
on path to becoming a Cleric.

13:00.790 --> 13:01.833
Good.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.126
And the mother?

13:03.209 --> 13:05.003
My spouse was arrested
and incinerated

13:05.086 --> 13:06.838
for sense offense
four years ago, sir.

13:06.922 --> 13:07.881
By yourself?

13:07.964 --> 13:09.174
No, sir... by another.

13:10.926 --> 13:13.428
How did you feel about that?

13:15.889 --> 13:17.515
I'm sorry.

13:17.599 --> 13:19.768
I don't...
fully understand, sir.

13:21.102 --> 13:22.771
How did you feel?

13:24.814 --> 13:27.359
I didn't feel anything.

13:27.442 --> 13:29.194
Really?

13:29.277 --> 13:31.655
How is it
that you came to miss it?

13:36.785 --> 13:38.620
I...

13:41.581 --> 13:44.000
I've asked myself
that same question, sir.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.627
I don't know.

13:47.170 --> 13:50.507
A nearly unforgivable lapse,
Cleric.

13:52.175 --> 13:56.888
I trust you'll be
more vigilant in the future.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.350
Yes, sir.

14:04.604 --> 14:07.357
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

14:07.440 --> 14:10.151
it reminds why we do
what we do.

14:10.193 --> 14:11.278
It does?

14:12.862 --> 14:14.948
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

14:15.031 --> 14:18.285
it reminds why we do
what we do.

14:18.368 --> 14:19.369
It does?

14:21.454 --> 14:23.415
It does.

14:26.376 --> 14:30.672
Prosecutorial evidence
for A.N.R. 136890.

14:30.714 --> 14:32.340
I need it.

14:32.382 --> 14:34.342
It was late this afternoon.

14:34.384 --> 14:36.636
May not have showed up
in the records yet.

14:38.054 --> 14:39.347
I'm very sorry, Cleric.

14:39.389 --> 14:40.849
Nothing has been logged

14:40.890 --> 14:43.351
and nothing is pending
under that entry.

14:43.393 --> 14:45.520
It was an item of evidence
brought in personally

14:45.562 --> 14:46.855
by Grammaton Errol Partridge.

14:46.896 --> 14:48.189
Check again.

14:48.231 --> 14:52.569
Sir, Cleric Partridge has not
entered anything in for weeks.

14:52.611 --> 14:55.655
You're mistaken.
It was a book of some kind.

14:55.739 --> 14:56.740
Cleric...

14:59.200 --> 15:00.535
...there's nothing.

15:02.245 --> 15:03.747
Thank you.

15:07.918 --> 15:10.045
He's been passing through
the gate into the Nether

15:10.128 --> 15:11.546
every night
for the last two weeks.

15:11.588 --> 15:13.173
We assumed it was
enforcement-related.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.969
You always knew.

16:08.853 --> 16:11.523
"But I, being poor...

16:11.606 --> 16:13.942
have only my dreams."

16:13.984 --> 16:18.321
"I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

16:18.405 --> 16:21.658
"Tread softly...

16:21.741 --> 16:25.078
because you tread
on my dreams."

16:26.830 --> 16:29.165
I assume you dream, Preston.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.336
I'll do what I can
to see they go easy on you.

16:35.463 --> 16:40.302
We both know...
they never go easy.

16:40.343 --> 16:41.553
Then I'm sorry.

16:41.636 --> 16:43.597
No, you're not.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.808
You don't even know
the meaning.

16:46.850 --> 16:49.477
It's just a... vestigial word

16:49.561 --> 16:51.479
for a feeling
you've never felt.

16:53.857 --> 16:56.234
Don't you see, Preston?

16:56.318 --> 16:58.403
It's gone.

16:58.486 --> 17:01.698
Everything that makes us
what we are... traded away.

17:01.781 --> 17:03.950
There's no war.

17:05.367 --> 17:06.703
No murder.

17:08.204 --> 17:09.998
What is it you think we do?

17:10.040 --> 17:11.875
No.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.251
You've been with me.

17:13.335 --> 17:16.713
You've seen how it can be...
the jealousy, the rage.

17:18.882 --> 17:20.842
A heavy cost.

17:23.261 --> 17:25.430
I'd pay it gladly.

17:49.371 --> 17:50.372
Don't.

18:32.872 --> 18:36.001
You and your partner
were close?

18:42.090 --> 18:44.175
I hope you're as pleased
to be assigned me

18:44.259 --> 18:46.094
as I am the placement.

18:47.470 --> 18:50.974
I was told this would be
a career-making advancement.

18:55.061 --> 18:59.065
I'm like you, Cleric...
intuitive.

19:00.317 --> 19:02.444
Sometimes I know
when a person's feeling

19:02.485 --> 19:04.321
before they know it
themselves.

19:14.831 --> 19:16.833
Cleric...

19:18.043 --> 19:20.629
I can only hope one day
to be as...

19:20.712 --> 19:24.716
uncompromising as you.

19:24.799 --> 19:26.134
Good night.

19:28.845 --> 19:30.931
The later 20th century

19:31.014 --> 19:34.142
saw the fortuitous
and simultaneous rise

19:34.184 --> 19:39.314
of two synergistic political
and psychological sciences.

19:39.356 --> 19:43.485
The first, the revolutionary
precept of the hate crime.

19:46.029 --> 19:47.155
John?

19:47.239 --> 19:48.240
Yes?

19:48.323 --> 19:51.451
I saw Robbie Taylor
crying today.

19:51.534 --> 19:55.205
He didn't know, but I saw.

19:55.288 --> 19:57.624
Do you think
I should report him?

20:03.380 --> 20:05.215
Unquestionably.

20:11.346 --> 20:14.140
...a single inescapable fact...

20:14.224 --> 20:17.227
that mankind united with
infinitely greater purpose

20:17.352 --> 20:19.938
in pursuit of war...

20:20.021 --> 20:23.775
than he ever did
in pursuit of peace.

20:32.033 --> 20:35.120
"But I, being poor...

20:35.203 --> 20:37.956
have only my dreams."

20:38.039 --> 20:41.376
I have spread my dreams
under your feet."

20:42.919 --> 20:45.213
"Tread softly...

20:45.255 --> 20:48.091
because you tread
on my dreams."

21:31.468 --> 21:33.136
Don't move! Don't move!

21:33.219 --> 21:34.804
Comply! Comply!

21:34.888 --> 21:36.806
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Get down! Get down!

21:40.977 --> 21:43.521
Don't shoot.
This is a lawful entry.

21:43.605 --> 21:45.106
We have a warrant
for your wife's arrest.

21:45.148 --> 21:46.983
She's charged
with sense offense.

21:59.996 --> 22:01.248
- Hey!

22:01.331 --> 22:04.167
Get her!
Get her off him now!

22:05.335 --> 22:06.670
Remember me.

22:20.183 --> 22:22.185
- Libria...

22:22.269 --> 22:24.020
Awake.

22:24.104 --> 22:29.317
Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet another day,

22:29.359 --> 22:32.946
another step
in our unified march

22:33.029 --> 22:36.616
- Into the unwavering purpose...

22:40.662 --> 22:43.331
...move ahead together

22:43.373 --> 22:47.002
into the certainty
of our collective destiny.

23:07.564 --> 23:09.399
What are you doing?

23:12.736 --> 23:14.988
I said, what are you doing?

23:15.071 --> 23:18.533
I accidently dropped my...

23:18.575 --> 23:20.160
morning interval.

23:20.243 --> 23:23.204
I took it out
before I brushed my teeth.

23:24.414 --> 23:26.791
I never take it out
before I brush my teeth.

23:26.875 --> 23:30.754
Then you'll go by Equilibrium,
log the loss,

23:30.837 --> 23:32.172
and get a replacement.

23:33.757 --> 23:35.175
Yes.

23:35.258 --> 23:37.010
Of course.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.950
Your new partner called.

24:00.033 --> 24:02.410
He says he'll pick you up
at 10:00 for the A.N.R.

24:02.452 --> 24:03.787
I hope you don't mind.

24:03.870 --> 24:06.206
I took the liberty
of telling him

24:06.289 --> 24:09.376
you would be at Equilibrium,
replacing your dose.

24:10.460 --> 24:11.962
No, of course not.

24:12.045 --> 24:13.964
That was the right thing
to do.

24:16.967 --> 24:19.344
Stop that.

24:26.476 --> 24:29.229
Due to terrorist activity,

24:29.312 --> 24:31.731
this site is
temporarily closed.

24:31.815 --> 24:37.237
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

24:38.488 --> 24:40.699
Due to terrorist activity,

24:40.782 --> 24:43.076
this site is
temporarily closed.

24:43.159 --> 24:45.579

24:45.662 --> 24:50.125
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

24:55.130 --> 24:56.881
More than punctual, Cleric.

24:56.965 --> 24:58.133
Hop in.

25:11.187 --> 25:12.856
How were the lines?

25:12.939 --> 25:15.358
I'm surprised you were able
to get your interval

25:15.442 --> 25:17.110
and get out so quickly.

25:18.361 --> 25:20.405
No, they're...
they're fine today.

25:24.367 --> 25:27.621
Maybe I'll drop by later,
get my interval adjusted.

25:29.205 --> 25:31.374
You expecting Resistance?

25:31.458 --> 25:34.669
That's something you'll find
about me, Cleric.

25:34.711 --> 25:38.757
I'm a wary person,
cautious by nature.

25:40.091 --> 25:42.427
Always expecting the worst.

25:44.888 --> 25:46.181
You can't do this.
You cannot do this.

25:46.222 --> 25:49.309
Tetragrammaton.
There's nothing we can't do.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.520
How long have you been off
the dose?

25:52.562 --> 25:53.688
Look at you.

25:54.898 --> 25:56.483
Look at you!

26:03.490 --> 26:04.658
Look at you.

26:06.868 --> 26:09.412
The mirror's frame is illegal.
Destroy it.

26:18.296 --> 26:21.132
We have suppression.
We're making entry.

26:21.216 --> 26:22.634
Standard deployment.

26:22.717 --> 26:25.512
Collecting catalog.
Illegal articles.

27:11.558 --> 27:13.351
You're gonna burn it,
aren't you?

27:14.603 --> 27:16.062
Eventually.

27:16.146 --> 27:18.815
However, you couldn't have
accumulated all this

27:18.898 --> 27:20.150
by yourself.

27:20.233 --> 27:23.236
It'll all be sorted
and examined.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.448
We'll discover
who your confederates are.

27:28.074 --> 27:29.117
Gun!

27:46.843 --> 27:48.511
We need her.

28:14.704 --> 28:15.705
What's your name?

28:15.789 --> 28:19.000
O'Brien, Mary.

28:19.042 --> 28:22.295
Well, Mary...

28:22.379 --> 28:23.755
you can either wait

28:23.838 --> 28:27.926
and tell the technicians
at the Palace of Justice...

28:28.009 --> 28:30.762
or you can tell me now.

28:30.845 --> 28:32.847
Who are your friends?

28:36.559 --> 28:39.062
I'm wondering if you have
any idea at all

28:39.145 --> 28:42.190
what that word means...
"friend."

28:45.569 --> 28:47.696
There's nothing
you don't feel?

28:49.406 --> 28:50.907
How about guilt?

28:52.742 --> 28:54.953
Let me ask you something.

29:03.753 --> 29:06.464
Why are you alive?

29:09.718 --> 29:12.220
I'm alive...

29:16.558 --> 29:17.892
I live...

29:20.395 --> 29:23.857
...to safeguard the continuity
of this great society.

29:23.940 --> 29:25.525
To serve Libria.

29:25.609 --> 29:27.027
It's circular.

29:27.110 --> 29:29.696
You exist to continue
your existence.

29:29.779 --> 29:31.239
What's the point?

29:33.450 --> 29:35.201
What's the point
of your existence?

29:35.285 --> 29:36.786
To feel.

29:36.870 --> 29:40.040
'Cause you've never done it,
you can never know it.

29:40.123 --> 29:42.876
But it's as vital as breath.

29:42.959 --> 29:45.587
And without it...
without love,

29:45.629 --> 29:49.132
without anger,
without sorrow...

29:49.215 --> 29:53.595
breath is
just a clock ticking.

29:57.807 --> 30:00.644
Then I have no choice
but to remand you

30:00.685 --> 30:02.938
to the Palace of Justice
for processing.

30:04.564 --> 30:06.316
Processing.

30:09.486 --> 30:11.655
You mean execution, don't you?

30:14.074 --> 30:15.742
Processing.

30:23.708 --> 30:25.627
The Gun Katas.

30:25.669 --> 30:28.630
Through analysis of thousands
of recorded gunfights,

30:28.672 --> 30:30.590
the Cleric has determined

30:30.674 --> 30:33.843
that the geometric distribution
of antagonists in any gun battle

30:33.927 --> 30:36.596
is a statistically
predictable element.

30:36.680 --> 30:40.100
The Gun Kata treats
the gun as a total weapon,

30:40.183 --> 30:42.435
each fluid position
representing

30:42.519 --> 30:45.522
a maximum kill zone,
inflicting maximum damage

30:45.605 --> 30:47.482
on the maximum number
of opponents

30:47.524 --> 30:49.276
while keeping
the defender clear

30:49.359 --> 30:51.611
of the statistically
traditional trajectories

30:51.695 --> 30:53.321
of return fire.

30:54.531 --> 30:56.449
By the rote mastery
of this art,

30:56.533 --> 30:59.744
your firing efficiency will rise
by no less than 120%.

30:59.828 --> 31:03.373
The difference of a 63% increase
to lethal proficiency

31:03.456 --> 31:05.834
makes the master
of the Gun Katas

31:05.875 --> 31:09.796
an adversary not to be
taken lightly.

32:00.263 --> 32:02.974
Without love...

32:03.058 --> 32:06.603
breath is just a clock...
ticking.

33:47.871 --> 33:51.875
Prozium...
the great nepenthe.

33:51.958 --> 33:54.169
Opiate of our masses.

33:54.210 --> 33:56.838
Glue of our great society.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.007
Salve and salvation,

33:59.049 --> 34:03.011
it has delivered us
from pathos, from sorrow,

34:03.053 --> 34:07.140
the deepest chasms
of melancholy and hate.

34:07.223 --> 34:09.726
With it, we anesthetize grief,

34:09.809 --> 34:13.897
annihilate jealousy,
obliterate rage.

34:13.980 --> 34:18.400
That those sister impulses
towards joy, love, and elation

34:18.485 --> 34:21.029
are anesthetized in stride,

34:21.112 --> 34:23.406
we accept as fair sacrifice.

34:23.489 --> 34:29.454
For we embrace Prozium
in its unifying fullness

34:29.536 --> 34:33.750
and all that it has done
to make us great.

35:26.803 --> 35:28.179
Good morning, Cleric.

35:28.263 --> 35:30.181
Good morning.

35:30.265 --> 35:34.311
...intrinsically, humans,
as creatures of the Earth

35:34.394 --> 35:40.650
were drawn inherently always
back to one thing... war.

35:40.692 --> 35:43.987
And thus we seek to correct
not the symptom

35:44.070 --> 35:46.615
but the disease itself.

35:46.698 --> 35:50.160
We have sought to shrug off
individuality,

35:50.243 --> 35:52.871
replacing it with conformity.

35:52.954 --> 35:55.832
Replacing it...

35:55.916 --> 35:58.627
with sameness...

35:58.710 --> 36:01.212
with unity,

36:01.296 --> 36:05.842
allowing each man, woman,
and child

36:05.926 --> 36:07.761
in this great society

36:07.844 --> 36:11.389
to lead identical lives.

36:12.933 --> 36:16.436
The concept of identical
environment construction

36:16.519 --> 36:19.773
allows each of us to head
confidently into each moment

36:19.856 --> 36:21.566
with all the secure knowledge

36:21.650 --> 36:24.486
it has been lived before.

36:39.292 --> 36:40.961
What are you doing?

36:44.756 --> 36:46.716
I'm rearranging my desk.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.469
You didn't like
the way it was before?

36:51.096 --> 36:52.681
I had no feelings about it.

36:52.722 --> 36:54.933
I'm merely attempting
to optimize.

36:57.978 --> 37:01.856
Sense offenders
holed up in the Nether.

37:16.079 --> 37:18.915
We estimate...
we estimate 50 men, sir.

37:18.999 --> 37:22.586
Intelligence tells us
they're all fully armed.

37:22.669 --> 37:26.298
This is the group that bombed
the Prozium factories.

37:26.381 --> 37:27.882
You clean, we'll sweep.

37:27.966 --> 37:29.509
Yes, sir.

37:32.512 --> 37:34.389
Go! Go! Go! Go!

37:34.431 --> 37:35.390
Go!

37:35.432 --> 37:37.058
Aah!

37:37.100 --> 37:39.519
Take it! Take the landings!

37:40.729 --> 37:41.730
- Aah!
- Aah!

37:53.199 --> 37:55.327
- Cover me. I'm going in.
- Aaaaaaaah!

37:59.205 --> 38:00.707
Nice grab, Cleric.

40:30.398 --> 40:34.277
"Ludwig Van Beethoven."

42:32.979 --> 42:34.147
Cleric...

42:35.190 --> 42:36.691
Why didn't you leave that

42:36.733 --> 42:39.527
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

42:45.659 --> 42:47.077
They miss things sometimes.

42:47.160 --> 42:50.288
I'll take it in myself...

42:50.372 --> 42:53.166
make sure
it gets done properly.

42:56.253 --> 42:58.255
You know, Preston...

43:00.006 --> 43:02.175
If we keep burning
all this contraband,

43:02.259 --> 43:04.469
eventually there won't be
anything left to burn.

43:04.552 --> 43:08.348
What'll there be
for men like us?

43:08.431 --> 43:10.100
Sir!

43:10.183 --> 43:11.726
We got something out back.

43:21.278 --> 43:23.655
We're gonna need
two more men on this.

43:29.119 --> 43:31.454
These animals were defended
by women and children.

43:31.496 --> 43:32.789
We put them down easily.

43:32.872 --> 43:36.501
This isn't the first time
we've seen this.

43:36.585 --> 43:38.837
Why do they keep
these animals?

43:38.920 --> 43:41.047
What, do they...
do they eat them?

43:43.049 --> 43:45.176
What do you want me
to do, sir?

43:45.260 --> 43:46.553
Exterminate them, of course.

43:46.636 --> 43:48.054
All right. Let's do it.

43:48.138 --> 43:49.889
- No.

43:49.973 --> 43:51.141
What's wrong, Cleric?

43:54.728 --> 43:56.938
Nothing.

44:09.951 --> 44:11.453
- Hey...

44:11.494 --> 44:12.746
Grab it.

44:12.829 --> 44:13.914
Grab it!

44:21.671 --> 44:23.840
Sir... toss it back in.

44:23.924 --> 44:25.759
I'll finish it off.

44:30.680 --> 44:31.681
Give it to me, sir.

44:31.765 --> 44:33.683
Give it to him, Cleric.
He'll finish it.

44:47.697 --> 44:48.949
Wait!

44:51.952 --> 44:54.496
It seems to me that...

44:54.579 --> 44:58.250
at least some of these animals
ought to be tested for disease.

44:58.333 --> 45:00.335
If there's an epidemic
in the Nether,

45:00.418 --> 45:02.879
it's best we know about it.

45:05.882 --> 45:09.678
I don't quite follow
your logic, Cleric.

45:09.719 --> 45:11.012
They were Resistance.

45:11.054 --> 45:13.306
They could have led us
to the Underground.

45:13.390 --> 45:15.016
But instead of apprehension
and interrogation,

45:15.100 --> 45:16.059
they were slaughtered.

45:16.142 --> 45:19.312
Yes, but, Cleric,
given the circumstances,

45:19.396 --> 45:20.981
the Father has decreed

45:21.064 --> 45:24.442
that there will be no more
"process" for sense offenders.

45:24.526 --> 45:26.903
They are either to be
shot on sight

45:26.987 --> 45:28.488
or incinerated without a trial.

45:28.572 --> 45:29.698
But it's counter to law.

45:29.739 --> 45:31.575
You're a member
of the Council. Lf...

45:31.658 --> 45:33.535
It is not the will
of the Council,

45:33.577 --> 45:36.371
it is the will of Father...
and he is law.

45:37.998 --> 45:40.500
Sir...

45:40.584 --> 45:43.503
without the logic of process,
is it not just mayhem...

45:43.587 --> 45:46.548
what we have worked so hard
to eradicate?

45:46.631 --> 45:48.758
You must understand, Preston,

45:48.842 --> 45:52.429
that while you... and even I...
may not always agree with it,

45:52.512 --> 45:55.223
it is not the message
that is important,

45:55.265 --> 45:58.518
it is our obedience to it.

45:58.602 --> 46:00.729
Father's will.

46:00.770 --> 46:03.398
Call it faith.

46:03.440 --> 46:05.483
You have it, I assume?

46:10.113 --> 46:11.448
Yes.

46:12.949 --> 46:14.492
I have it.

46:14.576 --> 46:16.119
Good.

46:37.474 --> 46:40.810
Confiscated evidence
X23-T45...

46:40.894 --> 46:43.271
Mary O'Brien.

47:45.375 --> 47:47.502
Cleric John Preston
passing into the Nether...

47:47.544 --> 47:49.713
enforcement-related.

47:52.716 --> 47:53.967
Thank you, sir.

48:25.916 --> 48:28.543
I don't know what else
to do with you.

48:31.421 --> 48:32.631
Go on.

48:32.714 --> 48:33.715
Go on.

48:36.343 --> 48:38.136
Go!

49:13.630 --> 49:14.756
Fine.

49:14.839 --> 49:16.883
But you're going back
in the trunk.

49:30.730 --> 49:32.274
Okay.

49:35.569 --> 49:36.820
Here.

49:48.206 --> 49:50.083
Step away from the vehicle!

49:50.166 --> 49:52.377
Step away from the vehicle!

49:52.460 --> 49:53.753
This is your last warning!

49:53.837 --> 49:56.673
Step away from the vehicle!

49:56.715 --> 49:58.925
Identification.

49:59.009 --> 50:00.427
I'm a Cleric.

50:00.510 --> 50:02.679
I'm here on official business.

50:02.762 --> 50:03.513
Identification!

50:04.848 --> 50:05.932
It's in my coat.

50:06.016 --> 50:08.226
Where's the coat?
Where is it?!

50:09.519 --> 50:11.563
I don't have it.

50:11.646 --> 50:14.357
Unidentified individuals are
subject to summary destruction.

50:14.441 --> 50:16.109
You're making
a very big mistake.

50:16.192 --> 50:17.235
I'm a Grammaton Cleric,
first class.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.320
We're gonna search
your vehicle.

50:18.403 --> 50:20.697
No, you're not.
There's nothing in it.

50:20.739 --> 50:22.198
Search it!

50:29.039 --> 50:30.999
- Clear, sir.
- Keys to the trunk.

50:31.041 --> 50:32.334
I'm trying to tell you.

50:32.375 --> 50:34.461
I have a predawn combustion
to witness.

50:34.544 --> 50:35.962
I'm not...

50:36.046 --> 50:38.006
Captain, this is a waste
of my time.

50:38.048 --> 50:39.382
My name is John Preston.

50:39.466 --> 50:41.801
I'm the highest-ranking Cleric
of the Tetragramm...

50:41.885 --> 50:43.470
Wait.

50:47.057 --> 50:48.099
Stand off.

50:50.936 --> 50:53.355
I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you, sir.

50:55.607 --> 50:57.901
That's okay.
Just doing your job.

50:57.943 --> 50:58.944
Thank you.

51:00.237 --> 51:01.863
We'll escort you back
to the gate.

51:01.947 --> 51:02.906
Thanks.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.331
Animals.

51:12.749 --> 51:14.251
Nether's full of them.

51:14.292 --> 51:16.211
Sounds like it came
from your trunk.

51:16.253 --> 51:18.213
Impossible.

51:18.255 --> 51:20.215
Just give me my keys.

51:20.257 --> 51:21.383
I'll be on my way.

51:27.097 --> 51:28.348
Captain...

51:28.431 --> 51:31.559
I'm asking you
one last time...

51:31.601 --> 51:33.395
don't do this.

51:34.938 --> 51:36.231
Down on your knees!

51:36.273 --> 51:37.899
- Down on your knees!
- Down on your knees!

51:37.941 --> 51:39.150
Drop down!

51:39.234 --> 51:41.486
On the ground! Comply!

51:41.570 --> 51:43.154
Do it!

51:43.905 --> 51:44.990
No.

51:45.073 --> 51:46.408
Fuck!

51:50.787 --> 51:52.163
What?

51:52.247 --> 51:54.541
Aw, shit! Shoot him!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

52:03.842 --> 52:05.051
Aah!

54:23.398 --> 54:25.901
Always practicing, Cleric.

54:25.984 --> 54:28.653
I guess that's why
you're the best.

54:31.781 --> 54:33.366
Maybe I'm just better.

54:34.409 --> 54:36.244
Something on your mind?

54:38.914 --> 54:40.248
Why do you ask?

54:40.290 --> 54:41.583
The intuitive arts, Cleric.

54:41.625 --> 54:43.752
It's my job to know
what you're thinking.

54:55.138 --> 54:57.766
So, then...
what am I thinking?

55:02.771 --> 55:05.815
About the murders
in the Nether last night...

55:12.155 --> 55:13.949
And if they know who did it.

55:19.746 --> 55:20.789
Am I close?

55:23.667 --> 55:26.127
So, tell me... do they know?

55:34.761 --> 55:36.638
There are theories.

55:36.680 --> 55:39.015
I have one or two of my own,
but at the moment...

55:39.057 --> 55:41.268
they're premature!

55:46.022 --> 55:47.399
I'm glad it happened.

55:52.237 --> 55:52.821
Why?

55:52.904 --> 55:54.990
Because now
Father and the Council

55:55.031 --> 55:58.577
have decreed an acceleration
in the crackdown on offenders.

55:58.660 --> 56:00.829
Whoever did it...

56:00.912 --> 56:04.291
all they accomplished was
a quicker end to the Resistance.

56:13.717 --> 56:15.510
It's gonna be
a massacre, Cleric.

56:32.235 --> 56:35.447
I came to tell you...
there's a raid in the Nether...

56:35.530 --> 56:38.533
Sector 7.

56:40.076 --> 56:42.203
So get ready.

57:23.578 --> 57:24.955
That door behind you...

57:26.998 --> 57:28.375
Go.

57:30.001 --> 57:31.378
Go, damn you!

57:35.799 --> 57:37.425
Get out of here, God damn it!
If you don't, you're dead!

57:37.509 --> 57:39.344
Don't do it.
He'll shoot us in the back.

57:39.427 --> 57:41.388
If I was gonna shoot you,
I'd shoot you in the face.

57:41.471 --> 57:42.806
Now go.

57:48.979 --> 57:50.814
Damn you! Follow me.

57:50.897 --> 57:53.608
Now! Let's go!

58:02.659 --> 58:04.202
There will be no detention.

58:04.286 --> 58:08.081
Repeat...
no detention for any purpose.

58:08.164 --> 58:11.960
All prisoners and apprehendees
are to be put down.

58:19.551 --> 58:21.636
Look out!

58:24.472 --> 58:26.099
Aah!

58:28.226 --> 58:29.644
Aaaah!

58:34.149 --> 58:36.443
Cleric, what's happening?
We heard gunshots.

58:38.028 --> 58:38.987
Go!

58:39.070 --> 58:41.323
What are you doing?
Cleric!

58:41.364 --> 58:42.657
They're Resistance fighters.

58:43.700 --> 58:44.659
Cleric!

58:47.537 --> 58:48.663
He's a sense offender!

59:32.791 --> 59:34.167
Cover all quadrants!

59:34.251 --> 59:35.585
Secure the perimeter!

59:46.596 --> 59:48.098
What is this?

59:49.266 --> 59:51.059
What are you doing?!

59:51.101 --> 59:53.687
Nicely done, Cleric.

59:53.770 --> 59:55.814
You drive them
into the trap...

59:57.816 --> 59:59.025
I close it.

01:00:05.198 --> 01:00:10.203
The very definition
of... teamwork.

01:00:10.287 --> 01:00:11.788
Don't you think?

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:17.419
Why don't you take the honors
of the execution, Cleric?

01:00:21.131 --> 01:00:24.301
These people should be taken
for clinical interrogation.

01:00:24.384 --> 01:00:25.552
Cleric...

01:00:25.635 --> 01:00:27.929
Father's rulings
are quite clear.

01:00:27.971 --> 01:00:30.765
Offenders are to be shot
on sight.

01:00:30.807 --> 01:00:32.392
They have valuable information.

01:00:32.475 --> 01:00:33.476
Cleric...

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.061
They can be put to
much better use.

01:00:35.145 --> 01:00:36.104
Cleric.

01:00:37.439 --> 01:00:41.234
If your weapon's low,
please, use mine.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:31.159
No.

01:01:34.454 --> 01:01:36.957
I think, in the end...

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.084
it'll be better
if you have it.

01:02:01.314 --> 01:02:02.315
Captain.

01:02:02.399 --> 01:02:04.359
Yes, sir. Firing positions.

01:02:08.613 --> 01:02:09.864
CAPTAIN: Ready...

01:02:18.748 --> 01:02:19.708
Aim...

01:02:26.464 --> 01:02:28.258
Fire!

01:02:34.973 --> 01:02:36.766
Sir?

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:38.685
Yes, Cleric?

01:02:38.768 --> 01:02:41.563
You asked me to become
Father's instrument

01:02:41.605 --> 01:02:44.316
against the Resistance.

01:02:44.399 --> 01:02:46.318
I'm ready.

01:02:46.401 --> 01:02:48.320
Today.

01:02:48.403 --> 01:02:50.196
I wish to show my faith.

01:02:52.282 --> 01:02:54.159
I wish, with your permission,

01:02:54.242 --> 01:02:57.120
to locate the Underground
once and for all.

01:02:57.203 --> 01:02:58.663
To destroy it.

01:03:01.458 --> 01:03:03.043
To destroy it.

01:03:03.126 --> 01:03:05.211
Good. Do it.

01:03:14.638 --> 01:03:17.599
I'm so...

01:03:17.682 --> 01:03:19.434
so very sorry.

01:03:31.112 --> 01:03:34.407
These are the possessions he had
on him at the time of death.

01:03:34.491 --> 01:03:35.867
The illegal ones
will be burned with him.

01:03:35.951 --> 01:03:37.244
Good.

01:04:18.827 --> 01:04:20.161
Errol Partridge.

01:04:24.124 --> 01:04:26.418
The name supposed to mean
something to me?

01:04:26.501 --> 01:04:29.254
He was a Grammaton Cleric,
first class. You knew him.

01:04:29.337 --> 01:04:32.591
News bulletin...
I'm a sense offender.

01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:34.843
I don't hang around much
with the Cleric.

01:04:41.558 --> 01:04:43.602
I want to know about him.

01:04:46.896 --> 01:04:48.148
Well...

01:04:48.231 --> 01:04:51.318
I suggest you go ask him.

01:04:52.402 --> 01:04:55.405
But I understand
that he's dead...

01:04:55.447 --> 01:04:59.075
killed by your friends
at the Tetragrammaton.

01:04:59.159 --> 01:05:01.870
Not by my friends.

01:05:01.912 --> 01:05:03.580
By me.

01:05:12.422 --> 01:05:13.965
Aaah!

01:05:48.166 --> 01:05:49.626
You were lovers.

01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:10.355
The Underground is our foe,

01:06:10.438 --> 01:06:12.983
and greater
than even the threat

01:06:13.066 --> 01:06:16.945
of those who have forsaken
their Prozium for emotion

01:06:16.987 --> 01:06:22.117
is the threat of those
selfsame individuals united.

01:06:22.158 --> 01:06:24.953
They are
the secret organization...

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.420
And thus, it is in the writing
of the Father

01:06:33.503 --> 01:06:35.255
that we find our greatest...

01:06:37.132 --> 01:06:39.009
Good afternoon, sir.

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:41.970
What will it be for you?

01:06:42.012 --> 01:06:43.763
The latest copy
of the inserts?

01:06:43.847 --> 01:06:45.974
Revised edition
of the manifesto?

01:06:46.057 --> 01:06:47.100
Errol Partridge.

01:06:47.183 --> 01:06:49.728
What do you know about him?

01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:51.146
I beg your pardon?

01:06:51.187 --> 01:06:53.064
Everyone out. Now.

01:07:06.912 --> 01:07:08.872
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

01:07:08.914 --> 01:07:11.541
Errol Partridge...
what do you know about him?

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:14.502
I'm sure this must be
some mis...

01:07:14.544 --> 01:07:16.838
- You're an offender.
- I'm not.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.758
No? Then why are you
so scared of me?

01:07:19.841 --> 01:07:22.886
Now, you will tell me everything
you know about Errol Partridge,

01:07:22.969 --> 01:07:24.888
or I will have a wagon
come to take you

01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:27.807
to the Hall of Destruction
for summary combustion.

01:07:27.891 --> 01:07:30.018
I-I really don't know...

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.186
Speak!

01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:34.856
He... he'd come in here
with a fellow named Jurgen.

01:07:34.898 --> 01:07:36.191
Why?

01:07:36.232 --> 01:07:39.361
That's... that's all I know.
I swear.

01:07:39.402 --> 01:07:40.403
Jurgen!

01:08:01.132 --> 01:08:02.926
Interesting.

01:08:04.761 --> 01:08:06.137
- Ugh-ow!
- Ugh!

01:08:40.964 --> 01:08:44.050
We've been watching you,
Preston.

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:51.558
You're Jurgen.

01:08:53.143 --> 01:08:55.895
You're feeling.

01:09:10.285 --> 01:09:12.370
Do you know why you came?

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.645
Welcome to the Underground.

01:09:48.156 --> 01:09:49.658
Polygraph.

01:09:49.741 --> 01:09:53.703
It detects fluctuations
of human emotion.

01:09:53.745 --> 01:09:55.914
We have to be sure.

01:10:01.044 --> 01:10:02.545
Mary.

01:10:09.052 --> 01:10:11.221
You're carrying
in your left pocket

01:10:11.304 --> 01:10:14.224
a red ribbon
sprayed with her scent.

01:10:16.518 --> 01:10:18.395
You breathe it in sometimes

01:10:18.436 --> 01:10:21.356
when you think
there's no one to see.

01:10:21.398 --> 01:10:25.360
But what you feel...

01:10:25.402 --> 01:10:27.946
what you feel
could only be satisfied

01:10:28.029 --> 01:10:30.657
by falling yourself into her.

01:10:36.288 --> 01:10:39.541
She's scheduled
for combustion...

01:10:39.624 --> 01:10:41.793
tomorrow.

01:10:47.674 --> 01:10:49.801
I know.

01:10:51.177 --> 01:10:53.513
You know, I was like you.

01:10:53.597 --> 01:10:57.559
But the first thing
you learn about emotion

01:10:57.601 --> 01:10:59.978
is that it has its price...

01:11:00.061 --> 01:11:02.939
a complete paradox.

01:11:03.023 --> 01:11:05.901
But without restraint...

01:11:05.942 --> 01:11:08.194
without control...

01:11:08.278 --> 01:11:10.196
emotion is chaos.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.324
But how is that diff...

01:11:12.407 --> 01:11:15.911
The difference being is
that when we want to feel,

01:11:15.952 --> 01:11:18.079
we can.

01:11:18.163 --> 01:11:21.750
It's just that...

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:25.712
some of us...

01:11:25.795 --> 01:11:28.048
some of us have to forgo
that luxury

01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:31.259
so that the rest can have it.

01:11:31.301 --> 01:11:33.386
Some very few of us

01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:37.390
have to force ourselves
not to feel.

01:11:39.142 --> 01:11:40.310
Like me.

01:11:42.187 --> 01:11:44.147
Like you.

01:11:49.277 --> 01:11:51.154
What can I do?

01:11:53.782 --> 01:11:55.867
You can kill Father.

01:12:31.319 --> 01:12:33.196
- Cleric John Preston...

01:12:33.238 --> 01:12:35.991
you are to come with us
immediately.

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:47.252
Cleric Preston.

01:12:47.335 --> 01:12:48.503
Sir.

01:12:51.381 --> 01:12:54.509
I've heard
the most disturbing rumor.

01:12:54.593 --> 01:12:55.885
Rumor, sir?

01:12:55.969 --> 01:12:56.928
Yes.

01:12:57.012 --> 01:12:59.306
A rumor maintaining
that one of us,

01:12:59.389 --> 01:13:00.765
one of the Cleric,

01:13:00.849 --> 01:13:04.936
has secretly taken it upon
himself to cease his dose,

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.856
that one of our elite number

01:13:07.897 --> 01:13:11.109
is actually feeling.

01:13:11.192 --> 01:13:13.111
Feeling, sir?

01:13:14.154 --> 01:13:16.865
Are you playing with me,
Cleric?!

01:13:22.203 --> 01:13:23.455
No, sir.

01:13:28.752 --> 01:13:32.213
This person, I'm told,

01:13:32.297 --> 01:13:36.009
is actually attempting
to contact the Resistance.

01:13:38.053 --> 01:13:41.556
Now tell me,
if you'll be so kind,

01:13:41.598 --> 01:13:43.475
how exactly...

01:13:43.558 --> 01:13:46.728
have you been making use
of your time of late?

01:13:52.609 --> 01:13:55.820
Attempting to contact
the Resistance, sir.

01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:02.410
Attempting?

01:14:04.246 --> 01:14:08.250
How is it that you intend
to expose this traitor

01:14:08.333 --> 01:14:11.378
if all you do is attempt?

01:14:16.758 --> 01:14:18.426
You're...

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:20.345
absolutely...

01:14:20.428 --> 01:14:22.597
100% right, sir.

01:14:23.932 --> 01:14:26.142
Of course I am.

01:14:28.561 --> 01:14:31.982
The Cleric is the final line
of defense.

01:14:32.065 --> 01:14:34.359
If the Resistance
compromises it,

01:14:34.442 --> 01:14:36.861
we are doomed.

01:14:36.945 --> 01:14:40.699
Father is doomed.

01:14:40.782 --> 01:14:43.410
I will redouble
my efforts, sir,

01:14:43.493 --> 01:14:45.287
to locate the Resistance,

01:14:45.328 --> 01:14:46.830
to find this traitor,

01:14:46.871 --> 01:14:50.208
and bring them all to
the Council's fair justice.

01:14:54.504 --> 01:14:55.630
Do it.

01:15:40.008 --> 01:15:41.217
What are you doing?

01:15:44.679 --> 01:15:46.264
What are you doing?

01:15:49.184 --> 01:15:50.644
I, uh...

01:15:55.565 --> 01:15:58.568
I was checking
to make sure you've been...

01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:00.278
taking your interval.

01:16:01.404 --> 01:16:03.073
And are you satisfied?

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:07.786
Yes, I am.

01:16:11.081 --> 01:16:12.540
Good night, Dad.

01:16:14.626 --> 01:16:16.336
MAR Y: I don't understand.

01:16:16.419 --> 01:16:19.047
My execution's set.

01:16:19.089 --> 01:16:21.549
Why are you here?

01:16:40.694 --> 01:16:42.195
Aren't you gonna dose?

01:16:56.084 --> 01:16:58.044
My God.

01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:01.047
What...

01:17:04.092 --> 01:17:06.261
What'll you do?

01:17:07.846 --> 01:17:09.472
I don't know.

01:17:44.174 --> 01:17:45.425
50 sweepers, maybe more.

01:17:45.508 --> 01:17:47.928
What about an audience? Can you
arrange to meet with him?

01:17:48.011 --> 01:17:49.971
Father's never given a single
audience since the upheaval.

01:17:50.055 --> 01:17:51.640
The danger of assassination
is too great.

01:17:51.681 --> 01:17:53.934
They trained you your whole life
to fight these kind of odds.

01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:55.644
Even if I could...

01:17:55.727 --> 01:17:57.479
even if I could
make it through,

01:17:57.562 --> 01:18:00.690
what guarantee is there
it would accomplish anything,

01:18:00.774 --> 01:18:02.317
that anything would be
different?

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.195
We have a network that's larger
than you could ever imagine.

01:18:05.278 --> 01:18:07.197
Instant word comes
that Father is dead,

01:18:07.239 --> 01:18:08.698
that the Council is leaderless.

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.909
Bombs that have already
been planted will be set off

01:18:10.992 --> 01:18:13.245
at Prozium clinics and factories
around Libria.

01:18:13.328 --> 01:18:15.664
If we can succeed
in disrupting the supply

01:18:15.705 --> 01:18:18.375
for even one day... one day...

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:21.002
our cause will be won
by human nature itself.

01:18:21.086 --> 01:18:24.130
What about war, the everyday
cruelties that are all gone now?

01:18:24.214 --> 01:18:26.216
Replaced by the touch
of Grammaton.

01:18:30.053 --> 01:18:32.097
Will you do it?

01:18:40.063 --> 01:18:42.065
Yes.

01:18:43.775 --> 01:18:44.985
Can you?

01:18:48.697 --> 01:18:50.365
I don't know.

01:19:00.584 --> 01:19:02.252
Don't...

01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:05.589
Seeing her one last time

01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:08.717
will only make it harder
to do what you have to do.

01:19:43.209 --> 01:19:45.795
...designed especially
to deal with it.

01:19:45.879 --> 01:19:47.464
The Cleric was implemented

01:19:47.547 --> 01:19:49.883
and sent out to search
and destroy

01:19:49.966 --> 01:19:51.426
such objects that remained

01:19:51.509 --> 01:19:54.471
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

01:19:54.512 --> 01:19:55.931
File footage.

01:19:55.972 --> 01:19:59.601
The Council...

01:19:59.684 --> 01:20:02.228
Viviana Preston.

01:20:02.312 --> 01:20:04.356
Sentence and incineration.

01:20:07.025 --> 01:20:08.109
Auditory.

01:20:08.151 --> 01:20:09.527
Viviana Preston,

01:20:09.611 --> 01:20:11.988
for ceasing your interval,
for the crime of feeling,

01:20:12.072 --> 01:20:13.198
you stand condemned

01:20:13.281 --> 01:20:15.492
to suffer annihilation
in the city furnaces.

01:20:15.575 --> 01:20:18.995
You will be taken there
immediately, and you will burn.

01:20:35.428 --> 01:20:37.973
The Cleric was implemented

01:20:38.014 --> 01:20:39.808
and sent out to search
and destroy

01:20:39.891 --> 01:20:41.434
such objects that remained

01:20:41.518 --> 01:20:45.605
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

01:20:45.689 --> 01:20:47.649
The Council...

01:21:28.356 --> 01:21:30.275
The incineration...
has it gone through?!

01:21:30.358 --> 01:21:32.110
It's going through now.

01:21:32.193 --> 01:21:33.695
Hey!

01:22:01.431 --> 01:22:04.559
Machine turbines priming.

01:22:04.601 --> 01:22:06.227
Machine turbines priming.

01:22:06.269 --> 01:22:08.355
Tetragrammaton... I need
to speak to this woman!

01:22:08.438 --> 01:22:10.065
You're too late, sir.
The time lock is engaged.

01:22:10.106 --> 01:22:11.358
If we force the door now,

01:22:11.441 --> 01:22:12.901
the turbines will explode
at street level.

01:22:12.984 --> 01:22:16.446
...personnel,
clear the area immediately.

01:22:16.529 --> 01:22:20.951
All unauthorized personnel,
clear the area immediately.

01:22:20.992 --> 01:22:24.079
Turbines primed.

01:22:24.162 --> 01:22:26.873
Fire in 10 seconds...

01:22:26.957 --> 01:22:28.708
9 seconds...

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:30.126
8 seconds...

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:31.503
7 seconds...

01:22:31.586 --> 01:22:33.838
6 seconds...

01:22:33.922 --> 01:22:35.924
5 seconds...

01:22:36.007 --> 01:22:37.133
4 seconds...

01:22:37.217 --> 01:22:38.843
3 seconds...

01:22:38.927 --> 01:22:41.429
2 seconds...

01:22:41.513 --> 01:22:44.724
Turbines... fire.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.737
Cleric John Preston...

01:23:44.367 --> 01:23:46.369
You are under arrest.

01:23:48.038 --> 01:23:49.873
This man...

01:23:49.915 --> 01:23:52.167
this senior Cleric...

01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:54.169
has ceased the dose.

01:23:55.211 --> 01:23:57.797
He is feeling!

01:23:57.881 --> 01:24:01.760
He is the worm that has been
eating at the core

01:24:01.843 --> 01:24:04.679
of our great society!

01:24:04.721 --> 01:24:06.389
And I...

01:24:06.473 --> 01:24:09.392
I have brought him
for your justice.

01:24:09.476 --> 01:24:11.186
Ugh!

01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:17.984
I told you I'd make my career
with you, Preston.

01:24:19.069 --> 01:24:20.528
Vice-Council...

01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:22.822
This man is guilty

01:24:22.906 --> 01:24:24.699
of consorting
with sense offenders,

01:24:24.741 --> 01:24:28.036
of having relations
with a female,

01:24:28.078 --> 01:24:31.373
of sense crime itself.

01:24:31.414 --> 01:24:33.750
Dispatch a search team
to the Cleric's quarters

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:34.876
to search for unused...

01:24:34.918 --> 01:24:36.211
Uh, that won't be
necessary, sir.

01:24:36.253 --> 01:24:38.046
If you'll run the trace
record on his side arm,

01:24:38.088 --> 01:24:40.298
you will find
that it was he

01:24:40.382 --> 01:24:43.218
who was with the sweeper team
when they were murdered.

01:24:48.807 --> 01:24:50.183
Cleric...

01:24:50.267 --> 01:24:52.560
I assume you have something
to say to me.

01:24:54.562 --> 01:24:57.148
I know...

01:24:57.232 --> 01:24:58.733
it's hard to believe...

01:25:01.278 --> 01:25:04.281
...that a Cleric
of the Tetragrammaton

01:25:04.322 --> 01:25:07.409
could turn his back
on everything he's been taught,

01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:09.953
would become associated
with the Resistance,

01:25:09.995 --> 01:25:14.249
even becoming a champion
in its Underground.

01:25:14.332 --> 01:25:16.334
But it's true.

01:25:20.338 --> 01:25:24.759
I promised that I would
bring you that man.

01:25:24.801 --> 01:25:25.885
And I have.

01:25:28.763 --> 01:25:30.932
- Cleric Brandt...
- Sir?

01:25:30.974 --> 01:25:33.893
The trace shows
that it was your gun

01:25:33.977 --> 01:25:36.605
in the Nether
with the sweepers.

01:25:36.646 --> 01:25:38.189
That's impossible.

01:25:42.694 --> 01:25:45.697
This is wrong.

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:48.533
I think, in the end...

01:25:48.617 --> 01:25:51.536
it'll be better
if you have it.

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:53.330
He switched them.

01:25:54.331 --> 01:25:56.166
He switched them.

01:25:56.207 --> 01:25:57.918
See, I have his gun now.

01:25:58.001 --> 01:26:00.754
Of course you do. You took it
when you arrested me.

01:26:00.837 --> 01:26:01.755
What?

01:26:01.838 --> 01:26:04.049
Take him
to the Hall of Destruction

01:26:04.132 --> 01:26:06.384
for summary judgment
and combustion.

01:26:06.468 --> 01:26:08.887
Wait, wait, wait. Wait!
I can explain this.

01:26:08.970 --> 01:26:12.098
Uh, sir, I'm not feeling!

01:26:12.182 --> 01:26:14.559
He is the one who's feeling!

01:26:14.643 --> 01:26:16.186
This is a mistake!

01:26:18.313 --> 01:26:20.106
Of course...

01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:23.068
since a complaint
has been lodged,

01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:26.029
law and the letter
is that I allow a team

01:26:26.112 --> 01:26:28.531
to carry out the search
of your premises.

01:26:28.615 --> 01:26:30.742
Do you think that's entirely
necessary, Cleric,

01:26:30.825 --> 01:26:34.829
or am I being
too... exacting?

01:26:34.871 --> 01:26:37.249
As you say, sir,

01:26:37.332 --> 01:26:39.251
it's the law and the letter.

01:26:39.334 --> 01:26:42.337
And it doesn't disturb you
in the least

01:26:42.379 --> 01:26:44.756
that your colleague
is going to his end?

01:26:44.839 --> 01:26:47.259
The only thing
that disturbs me, sir,

01:26:47.342 --> 01:26:50.011
is that I am Father's instrument
against the Underground,

01:26:50.095 --> 01:26:55.267
and yet... I've never had
the honor of meeting him.

01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:57.227
Hmm.

01:26:57.352 --> 01:26:59.020
Yes, but, Cleric, you know

01:26:59.062 --> 01:27:02.190
that Father never grants
an audience to anyone.

01:27:02.232 --> 01:27:04.568
Even to the man
who brings him the Resistance?

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.707
Sorry, sir.
Just a formality.

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:20.917
The search team will be up
momentarily.

01:27:21.001 --> 01:27:23.587
Excellent.
I have nothing to hide.

01:27:43.690 --> 01:27:45.901
The search teams are
already inside, sir.

01:27:45.942 --> 01:27:47.277
- Excellent.

01:28:08.131 --> 01:28:10.425
Looking for something?

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.932
If I were you...

01:28:17.015 --> 01:28:22.103
I'd be more careful
in the future.

01:28:27.192 --> 01:28:28.568
How long?

01:28:28.652 --> 01:28:30.904
Since Mom.

01:28:33.865 --> 01:28:34.950
And Lisa?

01:28:35.033 --> 01:28:36.284
Of course.

01:28:41.081 --> 01:28:42.749
How did you know?

01:28:42.832 --> 01:28:45.335
You forget...

01:28:45.418 --> 01:28:47.837
it's my job to know
what you're thinking.

01:28:51.049 --> 01:28:53.510
Then you know what
I'm gonna do now.

01:28:55.553 --> 01:28:55.679
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

01:28:55.679 --> 01:28:59.057
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.017
It's done.

01:29:01.059 --> 01:29:04.479
I've located the Resistance.

01:29:04.521 --> 01:29:06.856
Come now.

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:08.942
You'll have them all.

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:34.384
Do not address Father
unless first addressed by him.

01:29:34.467 --> 01:29:35.719
Avoid eye contact.

01:29:35.802 --> 01:29:39.014
If you should break
his personal security zone,

01:29:39.097 --> 01:29:41.641
you will be immediately
put down by snipers.

01:29:41.725 --> 01:29:43.351
Is that understood?

01:29:43.435 --> 01:29:46.563
You'll be required to surrender
your firearm, of course,

01:29:46.646 --> 01:29:48.565
and then there's the test.

01:29:48.648 --> 01:29:50.025
Test?

01:29:51.026 --> 01:29:53.445
Yes.

01:29:53.528 --> 01:29:56.531
You didn't imagine
we would risk exposing Father

01:29:56.615 --> 01:29:59.075
to even such a dedicated servant
as yourself

01:29:59.117 --> 01:30:02.412
without first having
tested you, did you?

01:30:06.249 --> 01:30:08.001
Please.

01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:23.391
Cleric...

01:30:23.433 --> 01:30:25.435
your weapon, please.

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:31.983
Here.

01:30:36.947 --> 01:30:38.073
Sit.

01:30:41.409 --> 01:30:43.662
We'll start with
a test question first.

01:30:43.745 --> 01:30:47.082
More of a riddle, actually.

01:30:48.458 --> 01:30:50.585
What would you say
is the easiest way

01:30:50.627 --> 01:30:52.879
to get a weapon away
from a Grammaton Cleric?

01:30:58.385 --> 01:31:00.971
You ask him for it.

01:31:08.228 --> 01:31:11.147
I told you I'd make
my career with you, Cleric.

01:31:14.651 --> 01:31:15.944
...to combine the capacity...

01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:18.780
Preston...

01:31:18.863 --> 01:31:21.324
Brandt's job was simple...

01:31:21.408 --> 01:31:23.910
to make you feel
like you'd won,

01:31:23.994 --> 01:31:27.122
to make you feel safe.

01:31:30.333 --> 01:31:33.878
For years, I tried
to infiltrate an agent

01:31:33.962 --> 01:31:35.463
into the Underground...

01:31:36.881 --> 01:31:38.967
...until it hit me...

01:31:39.009 --> 01:31:42.762
in order to pass undetected
into their midst,

01:31:42.846 --> 01:31:45.557
in order to be trusted by them,

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:51.021
my provocateur would
have to think like them

01:31:51.062 --> 01:31:53.982
and would have to feel
like them.

01:31:54.024 --> 01:31:56.985
But where to find
such a man...

01:31:57.027 --> 01:32:02.365
a man with the capacity to feel
who didn't yet know it?

01:32:05.285 --> 01:32:07.996
But...

01:32:08.038 --> 01:32:09.331
we've never met.

01:32:09.372 --> 01:32:11.207
No?

01:32:16.254 --> 01:32:18.798
Don't look so surprised,
Preston.

01:32:18.882 --> 01:32:20.717
Why should Father be more real

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.261
than any other
political puppet?

01:32:23.345 --> 01:32:26.264
The real Father died
years ago.

01:32:26.348 --> 01:32:28.266
The Council simply elected me

01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:31.227
to pursue
his paternal tradition.

01:32:31.353 --> 01:32:33.438
And you, Preston,

01:32:33.521 --> 01:32:36.399
the supposed savior
of the Resistance,

01:32:36.441 --> 01:32:38.318
are now its destroyer,

01:32:38.401 --> 01:32:43.156
and, along with them,
you've given me yourself...

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.866
calmly...

01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:46.826
cooly...

01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:51.623
entirely without incident.

01:32:55.752 --> 01:32:57.379
No.

01:32:58.922 --> 01:32:59.923
Oh...

01:33:00.715 --> 01:33:01.883
Shit.

01:33:03.843 --> 01:33:05.553
Not without incident.

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.062
I'm coming.

01:34:43.026 --> 01:34:44.861
You really should learn
to knock.

01:35:11.429 --> 01:35:14.808
How did it feel, Preston?

01:35:28.405 --> 01:35:30.657
- Agh!
- Ugh! Ugh! Uhh-ah!

01:35:32.576 --> 01:35:33.952
Wah!

01:35:34.035 --> 01:35:35.704
Ugh! Agh! Uhh!

01:35:35.745 --> 01:35:37.330
Ugh!

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:39.666
Ugh!

01:35:39.749 --> 01:35:41.751
- Aggh!
- Aggh!

01:35:55.599 --> 01:35:58.435
Mind the uniform, Cleric.

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:07.193
I plan to be wearing it
for a long time.

01:36:42.979 --> 01:36:45.690
Be careful, Preston.

01:36:45.774 --> 01:36:48.151
You're treading on my dreams.

01:37:23.186 --> 01:37:24.521
Ohh!

01:37:24.562 --> 01:37:26.314
Wait!

01:37:26.398 --> 01:37:27.440
Wait.

01:37:27.524 --> 01:37:28.942
Look at me.

01:37:29.025 --> 01:37:30.110
Look at me.

01:37:32.237 --> 01:37:33.905
I'm life.

01:37:33.989 --> 01:37:37.492
I live, I-I breathe...

01:37:39.536 --> 01:37:41.037
I feel.

01:37:43.039 --> 01:37:45.834
Now that you know it...

01:37:45.917 --> 01:37:48.712
can you really take it?

01:37:48.795 --> 01:37:50.839
Is it really worth the price?

01:37:56.928 --> 01:37:58.680
I pay it gladly.

...world to its knees.

01:38:39.763 --> 01:38:43.558
Two millennia ago...

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.268
in his conquest
of the known world,

01:38:45.352 --> 01:38:46.895
Alexander the Great
slaughtered

01:38:46.937 --> 01:38:49.564
more than one million
human beings.

01:38:51.232 --> 01:38:54.653
Three centuries later,
purely out of jealousy,

01:38:54.736 --> 01:38:57.989
Gaius Germanicus, "Caligula,"
murdered his own sister,

01:38:58.073 --> 01:39:00.742
impregnated
with his own child.

01:39:00.825 --> 01:39:01.952
