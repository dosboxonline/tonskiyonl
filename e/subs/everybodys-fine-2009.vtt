00:24.525 --> 00:28.236
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

00:28.321 --> 00:31.281
Never let it fade away

00:32.617 --> 00:36.536
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

00:36.621 --> 00:40.165
Save it for a rainy day

00:40.249 --> 00:44.336
For love may come
and tap you on the shoulder

00:44.420 --> 00:47.297
Some starless night

00:48.799 --> 00:53.053
Just in case you feel
you want to hold her

00:53.137 --> 00:56.556
You'll have a pocketful of starlight

00:56.641 --> 01:00.477
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket

01:00.561 --> 01:04.564
- Never let it fade away
- Never let it fade away

01:04.649 --> 01:08.401
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

01:08.486 --> 01:13.907
- Save it for a rainy day
- Save it for a rainy day

01:13.991 --> 01:18.954
For love may come
and tap you on the shoulder

01:19.038 --> 01:21.373
Some starless night

01:22.166 --> 01:27.379
And just in case you feel
you want to hold her

01:27.463 --> 01:30.757
You'll have a pocketful of starlight

01:30.841 --> 01:32.884
Pocketful of starlight

01:34.845 --> 01:38.932
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket

01:39.016 --> 01:42.894
- Never let it fade away
- Never let it fade away

01:42.979 --> 01:46.856
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket

01:46.941 --> 01:51.736
- Save it for a rainy day
- Save it for a rainy day

01:51.821 --> 01:54.406
Save it for a rainy,
rainy, rainy day

01:54.490 --> 01:59.744
For when your troubles
start in multiplyin'

01:59.829 --> 02:02.914
And theyjust might

02:02.999 --> 02:07.085
It's easy to forget them without tryin'

02:07.169 --> 02:10.880
With just a pocketful of starlight

02:10.965 --> 02:14.926
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

02:15.011 --> 02:31.776
Save it for a rainy day

02:33.696 --> 02:36.114
- You keepin' busy?
- Yeah, I been busy. You know.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.158
- Busy doin' what?
- Busy in the garden.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.952
"I n the garden." You know what?
You're missing work. That's what. I can see that.

02:41.037 --> 02:41.995
No, I'm not missing work.

02:42.079 --> 02:45.123
Yeah, you're missing the buzz
and the jokes and the guys.

02:45.207 --> 02:48.418
- I know that. Don't tell me that's not true.
- Maybe a little.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.212
- You gonna buy some meat or what?
- Yeah, I'm gonna buy some meat.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.965
I'm looking at some meat right now.
I want to get some real good steak.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.676
- I got a special here on the rump.
- Forget the specials.

02:56.761 --> 03:00.263
I got the children visiting me
this weekend from all over the country.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.557
Got 'em all around the same table—
all four of them.

03:06.479 --> 03:09.731
Cleanup, aisle five.
Cleanup, aisle five, please.

03:10.941 --> 03:11.900
Excuse me.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.903
Do you know about these wines?

03:14.987 --> 03:18.364
- The wine? These wines?
- Yeah.

03:18.449 --> 03:20.617
I stock this section.
Why? Is there a problem?

03:20.701 --> 03:25.705
No. I just want to get some expensive
bottles of wine for my children.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.124
This isn't for children.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.126
I know it's not for children.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.253
It's for my children
that aren't children anymore.

03:32.338 --> 03:36.216
What would be
the best ones of this?

03:36.300 --> 03:40.095
Well, we got wines
from all over the world.

03:40.179 --> 03:43.681
We got English wines,
you know, from France.

03:43.766 --> 03:47.894
We got Italian wines
from all over Europe.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.897
I want to make
a good impression on my kids.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.899
You will. Definitely.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.820
It's got a built-in tenderizing gauge
for steaks and poultry with seven different grades.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.115
And there's an automatic spritz
to calm flames if the oil catches.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.244
It is guaranteed for five years
with a premium protective seal.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.789
It has an automatic rotisserie,
and, when the lid is closed...

04:07.873 --> 04:12.210
the oxygen is reduced to a level
that does not support or encourage the fats to ignite.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.753
Yeah.

04:13.838 --> 04:16.756
- Is that what it's going for?
- 648. That's the sale price.

04:16.841 --> 04:19.050
That's a heck of a deal for this model.

04:19.135 --> 04:21.177
It's as low as I can go.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.180
- How about six?
- Done. Sure.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.515
Absolutely.

04:26.392 --> 04:28.434
You can just put it right in there.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.437
- Looks like somebody's having a party.
- Yeah, it's just family.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.338
- Hello?
- Dad, it's Robert.

04:57.423 --> 04:58.673
Robert.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.050
Dad, listen, things aren't looking good—

05:06.098 --> 05:08.808
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

05:08.893 --> 05:10.852
That's a real shame.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.689
Yeah, you're gonna miss out
on having some fancy wine...

05:14.773 --> 05:17.066
and filet mignon steak—

05:17.151 --> 05:21.154
- Have you heard from the others?
- Yeah. So far all of them are coming—

05:21.238 --> 05:23.198
some Friday night, some Saturday morning.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.491
I'm sorry I can't—

05:25.576 --> 05:27.577
Yeah, I'm sorry too, Robert.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.163
You gotta get back to that orchestra, Son.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.082
- I will. You take care.
- Okay. You take care too.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.835
Okay. Okay.

05:56.941 --> 05:59.108
Dad, hi. I can't stop right now.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.818
I'm back on stage in a few minutes.

06:00.903 --> 06:05.031
The producers are flying in from Paris
and want to see the original cast...

06:05.115 --> 06:08.243
so I just can't get away this weekend.

06:08.327 --> 06:11.704
I'm sorry. I know I haven't been home
since the funeral...

06:11.789 --> 06:14.499
but I'm trying, I promise.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.501
I love you. I'm thinking ofyou.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.336
Big kiss.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.881
Hey, Dad, it's Amy.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.175
I'm really sorry to have to do this...

06:24.260 --> 06:27.053
but things have just gotten
really crazy at the agency...

06:27.137 --> 06:29.555
and Jack's sick with a fever.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.892
He missed school today.
So between one thing and another...

06:32.977 --> 06:35.228
we're not gonna be able
to make it this weekend.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.021
I'm really sorry, Dad.

06:38.983 --> 06:41.401
And to make things worse,
I spoke to David today...

06:41.485 --> 06:44.195
and he can't make it either.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.864
He's got a lot going on—
a painting or something.

06:46.949 --> 06:52.412
But, anyway, I promise
we'll make it to you soon. Okay?

06:52.496 --> 06:54.122
Love you.

07:06.427 --> 07:10.763
Well, you can't. You can't just go flying
all across the country- not in your condition.

07:10.848 --> 07:14.475
Who said anything about flying?
What about buses? What about trains?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.060
I'm worried about your lungs, Frank.

07:16.145 --> 07:19.564
Don't worry about my lungs.
Worry about your lungs. My lungs are fine.

07:19.648 --> 07:23.443
Fibrosis of the lungs requires you
to take things easy. Now, you know that.

07:23.527 --> 07:26.571
I'm just going on the buses,
on the trains.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.407
You picked the wrong job, Frank. I mean—

07:29.491 --> 07:32.201
Breathing in humidified PVC.
all those years.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.581
You know, it's just about seeing
the family, you know.

07:36.665 --> 07:41.002
Jean always kept
in touch with everybody, and now it's—

07:41.086 --> 07:43.087
You know how it is. Now it's down to me.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.508
- How you managing on your own?
- I'm fine.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.177
- Fine?
- Fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.887
Fine?

07:51.722 --> 07:53.723
You know, when I lost my wife...

07:53.807 --> 07:56.684
I found myself talking to her
like she was still there.

07:56.769 --> 07:58.394
Went on for months.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.522
"Where the hell are my shorts?"

08:01.607 --> 08:04.984
No. No, no,
there's nobody there. Talking to myself.

08:05.069 --> 08:06.736
Crazy, huh?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.365
- You do that, Frank?
- No.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.908
No? No?

08:13.118 --> 08:14.118
Not yet.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.204
Look, you know,
I hear what you're saying. I do.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.499
But this trip,
it's not what you need right now.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.542
You gotta take things easy.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.795
Stay home.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.047
You know what you should do?

08:26.131 --> 08:28.257
Spend more time in the garden.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.681
Ed said it was fine.

08:35.766 --> 08:39.227
He said just take enough medication.

08:39.311 --> 08:42.021
Stick to trains and buses.

08:42.106 --> 08:44.524
And I'll take plenty of pictures...

08:44.608 --> 08:46.609
and I'll bring home the news.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.155
I'll start with David in New York.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.450
And if anything goes wrong,
I'll be right home.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.455
Got my keys...

09:00.457 --> 09:02.125
my wallet.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.128
My keys.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.131
Got my medication.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.467
Camera.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.638
Got my keys.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.581
Next.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.708
New York City. One-way, please.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.752
Eighty-seven dollars.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.839
Eighty-seven dollars. There's a hundred.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.759
- I'm going to see my son.
- Very good.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.762
- Know what he does?
- Absolutely no idea.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.599
- He's an artist.
- Gate 7. Thank you. Next.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.350
Thank you.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.537
What do you think of my work?

10:23.874 --> 10:26.709
You've been looking at it ever since
we left the station.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.295
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

10:29.379 --> 10:33.090
No, don't look at me. Look back
out the window. Tell me what you see.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.176
- Cars.
- No.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.888
- Trees?
- Well, yes, but no.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.057
Houses?

10:43.143 --> 10:47.063
J ust remember that you've been looking at it
ever since we left the station.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.774
Oh, the window. The glass.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.902
No. Not bad, but— That's a start, but—

10:54.071 --> 10:55.571
Birds.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.032
No. Not birds.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.246
Rocks.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.874
No. Rocks. No.
That's ridiculous. Rocks.

11:06.959 --> 11:09.877
You're just guessing.
I'm gonna stick with this lady here.

11:09.962 --> 11:13.172
- I think she has an idea.
- No. Honestly, I really have no idea what you—

11:13.257 --> 11:15.466
You know, just look for the rhythm.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.473
- The telephone poles.
- Close. Close.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.476
- The wire.
- Well, well— Keep going. Keep going.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.979
- Really, I give up.
- No, no, that's— Okay, that's it.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.439
That's it. The wire. That's good.
I mean, I didn't make the wire.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.234
I didn't hang the wire.
But I coated the wire.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.444
I protected it with PVC coating
against the rain...

11:35.529 --> 11:37.863
the moisture, heat— stuff like that.

11:37.948 --> 11:42.034
So what you actually see is not
the wire. It's my PVC coating.

11:42.119 --> 11:45.788
- I ran a thousand miles of wire a week, nonstop.
- Wow.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.790
Nonstop.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.586
You just think for a minute— all the conversations
that have taken place over that wire.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.964
Breaking good news and bad news.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.426
You know.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.096
- Can I show you something?
- Sure.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.806
There are my...

12:05.309 --> 12:06.475
children.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.687
Robert the conductor.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.773
David the artist. Rosie the dancer.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.775
Amy- very high up in advertising.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.820
A million feet of wire to get them
where they are today.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.698
That's a nice picture.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.908
Thank you.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.995
A million feet of wire to get them
where they are today.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.833
Rocks.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.378
Yeah, right. That's right. Rocks.

12:37.758 --> 12:41.427
They were all supposed to visit me.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.429
We were gonna have a family reunion...

12:43.513 --> 12:46.515
and instead they all canceled on me
at the last minute.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.046
You lock yourself out, honey?

14:00.382 --> 14:02.883
No, I didn't lock myself out.
My son lives here.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.635
I'm just waiting for him.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.722
You can come wait with me ifyou want.
I know a place.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.474
- Oh, thank you. That's nice ofyou, but—
- You sure?

14:10.559 --> 14:12.601
- Thank you.
- You want to see my leg?

14:14.938 --> 14:17.022
You want to see mine?

14:37.627 --> 14:38.836
- Come on.
- Here.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.296
Oh, man.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.049
- Oh, dude, I can't believe you, man.
- What?

14:44.134 --> 14:46.302
I can't believe you. All night.

15:24.674 --> 15:25.966
David.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.728
What are you gonna do
when you grow up, huh?

15:37.813 --> 15:40.940
- I want to be a painter and do my pictures.
- Not a painter. Christ.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.860
Painters paint walls, and dogs pee on walls.
You're gonna be an artist.

15:44.945 --> 15:48.739
Artists paint pictures that change people's lives.
Now what are you gonna be?

15:48.824 --> 15:50.741
- An artist.
- That's right. An artist.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.910
- So you're gonna work hard?
- Yes, Dad.

15:52.994 --> 15:56.455
- You're gonna make me proud?
- I'm trying, Dad.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.727
Unfortunately, it's going to be on top
of the coast sometime tomorrow.

16:18.812 --> 16:23.649
Right now, Hurricane Alice
is packing winds of 1 65 miles per hour.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.485
We've got a Category 5 hurricane.
The pressure—

16:26.570 --> 16:28.070
Looks like a bad storm.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.283
A bad storm.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.702
I'm 94.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.330
- I keep away from the doctors.
- Boy.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.750
I have three children, six grandchildren.

16:42.711 --> 16:46.797
They're busy. They're too busy to talk to me.
I gotta make an appointment.

16:46.882 --> 16:49.800
They got lost someplace.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.678
They don't need anybody.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.764
People change. Life is changed.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.892
Today, you shake hands with somebody...

16:57.976 --> 17:01.270
you gotta count your fingers
to make sure you got five fingers back.

17:17.621 --> 17:18.704
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.706
- Can I help you?
- Do the bells work?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.207
Yeah.

17:22.292 --> 17:24.752
My son lives in Apartment 9.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.754
I'm not sure if he's home.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.505
- All right.
- Thank you.

18:06.795 --> 18:07.836
David?

19:00.265 --> 19:02.766
Through my sleepless days

19:02.851 --> 19:05.019
I've found

19:05.103 --> 19:09.773
That in my dreamless sleep I'm bound

19:09.858 --> 19:13.902
To one night hear the sound

19:13.987 --> 19:16.363
Ofyou calling

19:16.448 --> 19:20.534
Do not stumble through tonight

19:20.618 --> 19:23.495
Have no fear for me

19:23.580 --> 19:27.791
You won't stumble through tonight

19:27.876 --> 19:30.919
Drownin' in their laughter

19:33.631 --> 19:35.591
This is not good.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.179
Amy, it's Rosie.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.892
- Dad's not answering his phone.
- Well, don't call him...

19:44.976 --> 19:46.894
not till we know
what's going on with David.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.563
- Is there any more news?
- No.

19:49.647 --> 19:53.400
I just had that one call
from Mexico saying he'd been arrested.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.152
I keep leaving messages,
but no one's calling back.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.404
I think we should tell Dad.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.406
Not until we know what's going on.

19:59.491 --> 20:03.243
Just avoid talking to him for a couple days
till we know the facts, okay?

20:03.328 --> 20:05.412
Okay.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.054
- Oh, my God.
- Surprise.

20:22.138 --> 20:25.182
Yeah, definitely. Come on in, Grandpa.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.605
Man. Does Mom know?

20:31.689 --> 20:34.066
No, I hope not. But, hey, look at you.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.110
I thought you were supposed
to be in bed with a fever.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.195
- I don't know. Am I?
- That's what she told me.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.072
Yeah, I think I was.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.492
- It's got a handle.
- Well, of course it's got a handle.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.618
I didn't know that.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.746
- Yeah, it's got wheels.
- Well. Look how big you got.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.331
I know, right?

20:50.333 --> 20:53.127
- Gee.
- Hey, listen.

20:53.211 --> 20:55.212
I'm online.
I'll be back in a minute.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.589
All right. You do your thing.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.717
- Mom's out back.
- Okay. Good.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.681
No, I need to go down there.

21:05.765 --> 21:09.852
Yeah. Can you check out some flights
to see what's available?

21:16.860 --> 21:17.860
Yeah.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.405
Amy .

21:22.532 --> 21:23.657
Dad?

21:30.623 --> 21:33.000
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean, what am I doing here?

21:33.084 --> 21:35.335
Everybody didn't show up
for the visit, so I said...

21:35.420 --> 21:39.506
- "Ifyou don't come to me, I'm gonna go to you."
- Oh, you crazy man.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.092
Well, look at you. You haven't been well.
You shouldn't be traveling.

21:42.177 --> 21:44.094
- Did you check with the doctor?
- I checked with the doctor.

21:44.179 --> 21:47.097
- You checked with him?
- Of course I checked with the doctor. Jeff home?

21:47.182 --> 21:51.059
No, not yet.
Let me find out when he's coming back.

21:51.144 --> 21:54.229
So, everybody dropped out of the visit?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.899
I didn't realize. I had no idea.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.152
How did you get here?

22:00.236 --> 22:02.404
- You didn't fly, did you?
- No, of course I didn't fly.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.282
I took a train to New York to see David,
and he wasn't there...

22:05.366 --> 22:07.284
so I took a bus here.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.286
You took a bus?

22:09.370 --> 22:10.829
- Yeah.
- To Chicago?

22:10.914 --> 22:13.582
- All by myself.
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.709
Yeah. Jack got better fast.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.337
Yeah. No, he did. Definitely.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.088
It was a 24-hour thing.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.346
- I like the house.
- Yeah. But you've seen pictures.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.473
I've seen pictures.
I haven't seen the house.

22:29.557 --> 22:32.017
- Not the real thing.
- Hey, everyone.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.520
- Hey, Jack.
- How's it goin'?

22:35.605 --> 22:37.856
- Good.
- Jack, why don't you take Grandpa outside...

22:37.941 --> 22:40.400
- and show him your golf-
- You play golf?

22:40.485 --> 22:42.778
Sure. I'm a natural.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.905
- Yeah, I'd like to see that.
- You want to see that?

22:44.989 --> 22:47.199
- Where are you hitting it?
- To that flag over there.

22:47.283 --> 22:48.909
All the way out there?

22:48.993 --> 22:51.245
Oh, boy. Okay.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.288
- My record's three.
- Three?

22:54.916 --> 22:57.584
I'll believe that when I see it.
Come on. Let's go.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.503
- You watch.
- Okay.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.804
Not bad.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.225
- Beat that.
- Oh, I'll beat that. Easily, but—

23:13.309 --> 23:14.810
All right.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.814
Now I'll just have to
show you a few things.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.609
Yeah, that was good, but not good enough.

23:22.694 --> 23:24.611
Frank the pro.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.615
- Come on, Tiger Woods.
- You ready?

23:30.243 --> 23:33.161
- Take your time.
- Yeah. Ready? Yeah.

23:34.664 --> 23:35.998
Oh, shit!

23:36.666 --> 23:38.166
- Sorry.
- What was that?

23:39.544 --> 23:41.044
That was just a practice shot.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.505
- Give me another one of those.
- I'm going after this.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.133
Yeah.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.969
There we go.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.514
Oh, shit.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.267
Christ. Sorry.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.269
- You hit the spice garden.
- One more. Come on.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.688
- This is the last one. Come on. This is—
- I'm your guest. One more.

23:59.772 --> 24:03.567
- Let's go. Come on. One more, one more. Let's go.
- This is my last one.

24:03.651 --> 24:04.943
- One more.
- Don't lose this one too.

24:05.028 --> 24:07.404
Give me another ball.
Put it down. Be a sport.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.781
- I wanna watch this baby fly.
- You ready?

24:09.866 --> 24:11.825
- Ready?
- I mpress me.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.789
Shit! Damn it. Fuckin' Christ.

24:17.874 --> 24:20.709
Sorry.

24:21.961 --> 24:26.256
Can you just—
Yes, Chinese food would be fine.

24:26.341 --> 24:29.051
No, of course not.
No, he doesn't know anything.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.720
So I hear you're doing
very well at school.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.223
- Nah, not really.
- What do you mean, not really?

24:35.308 --> 24:38.643
- Your mother says you're at the top ofyour class.
- Does she?

24:38.728 --> 24:40.729
Yeah.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.650
You have to work hard at school.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.194
Yeah, I know.

24:47.278 --> 24:50.197
I'll tell you what I used
to tell your mother when she was your age.

24:50.281 --> 24:52.324
About being the best
and getting to the top?

24:52.408 --> 24:54.785
That's right.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.537
Yeah. She warned me about that.

24:57.622 --> 24:58.622
Yeah.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.599
- Jeff's home.
- Okay.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.235
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Jeff.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.362
What's all this? Come here. Come here.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.573
Surprise.

25:33.658 --> 25:35.409
- Big surprise. Big surprise.
- Yeah.

25:35.493 --> 25:38.370
- Look at you. You're looking so well.
- You too.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.539
It's good to see you.

25:40.623 --> 25:43.083
- Good to see you.
- Oh, my God! What a day!

25:43.167 --> 25:45.544
You don't want to know.
I'm sorry I'm so late.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.754
- Can you believe this?
- Can I believe it?

25:47.839 --> 25:50.090
Well, nothing surprises me about this guy.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.511
Well, the place was really crowded today.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.763
I can't believe I was able
to get out of there alive.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.559
Don't just eat your rice.
Make sure you eat your chicken.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.144
Okay.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.374
I'll get you a fork.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.835
- You don't know how to use chopsticks?
- Yeah, I can use 'em.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.921
I can use 'em to beat you at golf.
That's how well I can use 'em.

26:30.006 --> 26:32.257
- You like making fun of me, don't you?
- Yeah, you're funny.

26:32.341 --> 26:35.260
- Yeah, I'm funny, huh?
- Try this.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.637
Thanks. A fork. A regular fork.

26:37.722 --> 26:40.724
Now I can eat without dropping this
all down my shirt.

26:40.808 --> 26:44.019
Jack, can you pass Dad
the chili sauce, please?

26:45.688 --> 26:46.688
Jack.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.615
No.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.200
Jack, pass him the sauce.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.826
- I'm not passing anything.
- Don't be silly.

26:59.911 --> 27:03.038
I don't really want it.
It's fine. I don't need it.

27:04.540 --> 27:05.624
Are you sure?

27:05.708 --> 27:09.419
Stop asking him. He's not stupid.
When he says no, he means no.

27:10.505 --> 27:13.590
If he changes his mind, he knows where it is.
He can get it himself.

27:13.674 --> 27:14.674
Jack.

27:16.886 --> 27:18.428
I'm sorry, Dad.

27:18.513 --> 27:20.639
No, that's okay.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.939
So, what are your plans?

27:29.023 --> 27:34.903
Well, I thought that I would
stay a day or two...

27:34.987 --> 27:39.574
or so, and then head on out to see Robert,
surprise him on his tour.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.202
That would have been so great.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.955
This week's really difficult.

27:45.039 --> 27:47.123
I feel awful.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.834
I got this huge pitch
to oversee at the agency...

27:49.919 --> 27:52.254
and Jeff's flying out
on business tomorrow.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.256
We should...

27:54.340 --> 27:57.551
arrange it properly, another time.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.761
Well, maybe I can just
spend time with Jack.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.930
Yeah, that would have been great too...

28:02.014 --> 28:07.018
but he starts school again tomorrow,
and then he's off on a field trip...

28:07.103 --> 28:09.563
- for three days.
- A field trip. Where you going?

28:09.647 --> 28:12.941
I don't know.
Nobody tells me anything anymore.

28:15.736 --> 28:19.239
Well, you know, look. That's what happens
when you show up unexpectedly.

28:19.323 --> 28:22.200
I understand. You're busy. That's fine.

28:22.285 --> 28:24.619
Look—

28:25.955 --> 28:29.124
Oh, God. I feel awful.
Any other time but this week.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.126
Listen, I've had a good time.

28:31.210 --> 28:34.546
I've seen the house.
I've seen Jeff and you...

28:34.630 --> 28:36.715
and I let this guy beat me at golf...

28:36.799 --> 28:38.842
so, all in all,
it's been a pretty good trip.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.261
- I'm really sorry, Dad. Really.
- No—

28:41.345 --> 28:44.514
Look, I'm gonna call Robert tonight
and find out where he's gonna be at.

28:44.599 --> 28:47.517
He's really busy,
and he's on tour.

28:47.602 --> 28:49.769
And I just don't know
if it's gonna be possible. What?

28:49.854 --> 28:51.938
Oh, no. Don't call him,
because I wanna surprise him.

28:52.023 --> 28:54.024
Okay.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.317
Promise?

28:55.401 --> 28:58.320
Yeah, promise. Absolutely. Yeah.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.661
If that makes you feel better.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.666
I'm putting Dad on the train tomorrow.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.210
- He'll be with you in Denver the next morning.
- What?

29:14.295 --> 29:16.880
- I'm rehearsing. I haven't got time to meet him.
- He can't stay here.

29:16.964 --> 29:20.133
I need to get on a flight to Mexico to see
what's going on with David.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.885
Is he okay? Have you spoken to him?

29:21.969 --> 29:24.346
No, but I got through to the police today.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.765
No surprise. They said
the arrest was drug related...

29:26.849 --> 29:28.892
but they won't give me
any more details over the phone...

29:28.976 --> 29:31.561
- so I'm gonna try and get on the flight tomorrow.
- Amy, listen.

29:31.646 --> 29:34.481
I don't know if I can
lie to Dad about David when he gets here.

29:34.565 --> 29:37.567
Well, just make up
an excuse to get him to Rosie's.

29:37.652 --> 29:41.404
Say you're flying off
to Europe for a concert or something.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.448
That's too obvious. I'm not gonna do that.

29:43.532 --> 29:46.534
- Well, think of something yourself.
- Are you okay?

30:00.841 --> 30:03.593
Jeff, come on.

30:03.678 --> 30:04.678
Here.

30:08.099 --> 30:10.850
Jeff, come on.
Dad's waiting to take a photo.

30:10.935 --> 30:13.478
Just get it out,
and I'll look at it when I get there.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.230
All right. Okay, bye.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.232
I'll take one ofyou two first.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.402
- Okay.
- All right. Here?

30:20.486 --> 30:25.073
A little lower this way. Okay.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.533
A little—

30:29.704 --> 30:31.621
Together. Everybody together.

30:31.706 --> 30:33.248
Together.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.961
- Where's the—
- J ust the silver button on the top.

30:38.045 --> 30:39.963
Oh, my God. This is film. This is great.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.297
- Smile.
- Watch your finger.

30:41.382 --> 30:43.174
- Your finger's on the edge. J ust—
- Yep. Okay.

30:43.259 --> 30:45.385
Look at me. Beautiful.

30:45.469 --> 30:46.594
All right.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.889
You said Jack was at the top of his class...

30:49.974 --> 30:51.766
but he says he's not doing that well.

30:51.851 --> 30:54.060
Well, he was at the top of his class.

30:54.145 --> 30:57.480
He's struggling at the moment.
That's all.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.234
I tell you the good news
and spare you the bad.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.528
Isn't that what Mom used to do
for you when we were kids?

31:03.612 --> 31:05.530
It doesn't matter what your mother did.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.783
Tell me the bad news as well as the good news
from now on. Do you understand?

31:08.868 --> 31:10.785
Fine.

31:12.121 --> 31:13.621
You doing okay at home?

31:14.623 --> 31:15.790
- You doing okay at home?
- Fine.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.292
- You sure?
- Yeah.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.085
You sure?

31:21.005 --> 31:23.631
I didn't realize there was so much
to do around the house.

31:23.716 --> 31:26.134
Mom would have loved to hear you say that.

31:27.344 --> 31:29.262
Yeah.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.973
What was all that at dinner last night
with the chili sauce?

31:33.434 --> 31:36.352
Jeffjust doesn't let Jack
get his own way all the time.

31:36.437 --> 31:38.438
That's all. They always fight.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.568
I checked the train times.
There's one in a few hours.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.446
I just gotta drop by the office first.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.573
- Advertising?
- Advertising agency.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.033
Your agency?

31:51.118 --> 31:52.994
Part mine.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.259
Amy, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, darling.

32:08.344 --> 32:10.261
- Jesus Christ.
- To your left a little.

32:10.346 --> 32:13.348
- Your left, your left.
- Okay.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.099
One more. It's okay.

32:15.184 --> 32:17.435
J ust— Move to your left.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.354
Left, left, left.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.105
That's it.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.524
Got it.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.526
- You got it?
- Yeah.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.779
- No, that's a fish—
- Looks good?

32:27.863 --> 32:29.239
Looks great. I think it works perfectly.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.824
- So remind me of the market.
- Yep.

32:30.908 --> 32:33.451
It's homeowners—
blue collar to middle class.

32:33.536 --> 32:35.119
Like my dad.

32:35.204 --> 32:38.289
- I guess, yeah.
- J ust like your dad.

32:38.374 --> 32:39.624
- Kind of like him.
- Sure.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.751
So pitch it to him.
Let's see what he thinks.

32:41.836 --> 32:43.545
- Hey, Dad, come over here.
- Yeah.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.296
- Right now? Sure.
- Yeah.

32:45.381 --> 32:48.049
- Hey. Tom.
- Tom. Hi, Tom. Frank.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.218
- Frank, I'm Steph.
- Steph?

32:50.302 --> 32:52.178
- Hi, Dad.
- H i. Frank.

32:52.263 --> 32:53.263
"Dad," 'cause of-

32:53.347 --> 32:55.515
They got a TV commercial.
They're gonna pitch it to you.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.392
- Okay?
- To—

32:57.476 --> 32:59.060
- Sit down.
- Sit here?

32:59.144 --> 33:01.229
- Yeah.
- I n your chair?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.273
Yeah.

33:03.357 --> 33:05.567
- Now you're in charge.
- Oh, nice chair.

33:05.651 --> 33:09.279
Okay, so it's an ad for TV
for a financial organization.

33:09.363 --> 33:11.447
Yeah, don't tell him. J ust pitch it.

33:11.532 --> 33:13.867
I'm so sorry. Okay.
So there's a guy by a lake...

33:13.951 --> 33:15.577
and he is fishing just like this.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.454
Pine forests, snow-covered mountains.

33:18.539 --> 33:20.456
Oh, and he's wearing a quilted jacket...

33:20.541 --> 33:23.126
- 'cause it's really cold.
- What do you do when it gets cold?

33:23.210 --> 33:25.420
- Put a quilted jacket on. Couple layers.
- He's a little nippy.

33:26.755 --> 33:29.674
Okay, here we go.
Big fish jumps out of the water.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.635
I'm talkin' a big mother
with big, beady eyes.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.262
- Kind of looks like—
- J ust like that.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.265
Right. Looks at the guy right
in the eyes and he says...

33:37.349 --> 33:39.767
"Hey, brother, you lookin' for me?"

33:41.270 --> 33:42.896
Voice-over—

33:42.980 --> 33:45.857
"Ever wonder why life wasn't this easy?
At Crest and Landing...

33:45.941 --> 33:50.528
transferring multiple loans
to one company can be this easy."

33:50.613 --> 33:53.406
Okay? We cut to a shot
right here of this guy by a campfire.

33:53.490 --> 33:56.409
We see that big fish right above some coals—
Close-up of the fish.

33:56.493 --> 33:59.370
Boom. Right there as he says...

33:59.455 --> 34:03.291
"Hey, buddy, I'm done on this side.
Wanna turn me over?"

34:03.375 --> 34:05.668
- That's—
- Like it?

34:05.753 --> 34:07.670
Yeah, it's funny.

34:07.755 --> 34:10.173
It's funny. The fish talking—
it makes me laugh. Yeah, it's funny.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.300
- It's very funny.
- Fish usually don't talk. That's why it's—

34:12.384 --> 34:14.302
The fish with the face and a voice.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.721
He looks like a fish.
You look like a fish.

34:16.805 --> 34:19.057
- Kinda.
- Oh, my God. I just said that to him yesterday—

34:19.141 --> 34:21.351
That he looked like—
H is mom looks like a flounder.

34:21.435 --> 34:23.394
What was it for?

34:23.479 --> 34:25.647
Well, the fish.

34:25.731 --> 34:30.652
- The spot— What was it selling?
- Yeah, the loans. That—

34:31.654 --> 34:34.072
It's transferring the loans to another company.

34:34.156 --> 34:37.158
- It's as easy as getting the fish out of the water.
- Good.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.160
So, does the client like it?

34:39.244 --> 34:41.537
- Likes it but doesn't want to go with it.
- Why not?

34:41.622 --> 34:46.042
They feel uncomfortable about saying
that it's easy to transfer your debt.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.419
- Because?
- Because it's not.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.421
- It's actually a nightmare.
- It's, like, really hard.

34:50.506 --> 34:52.757
- It's, like, an impossible dream.
- It's like Sudoku.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.926
Okay, but he's not paying us to advertise...

34:55.010 --> 34:56.970
the fact that he has
a perfectly average product.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.972
He's paying us to be
economical with the truth...

34:59.056 --> 35:02.350
so tell him from me he's gotta go
with the talking fish.

35:03.811 --> 35:06.646
By the way, your daughter
is really good at herjob.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.065
I know. That's the way she is.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.067
And she has great hair.

35:12.403 --> 35:13.736
Okay.

35:21.662 --> 35:23.579
I know.

35:23.664 --> 35:25.748
Yeah, but you know what? It was fine.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.835
But it would be really awesome.
I mean— No.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.088
There was a line. Sorry.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.924
My watch is off by an hour.
Should I change it?

35:35.009 --> 35:38.594
You came from New York,
so, yeah, you need to go back an hour.

35:38.679 --> 35:40.596
Central time.

35:42.516 --> 35:44.809
You were laughing on the phone.
That was nice to see.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.060
- I was?
- Yeah.

35:46.145 --> 35:49.689
- It was just work.
- It was nice.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.692
- Was it the fish?
- The what?

35:52.776 --> 35:55.903
- The fish.
- Oh, yeah. The client went with the fish.

35:55.988 --> 35:58.031
He said they should give it a name.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.033
I said we should call it Frank.

36:00.117 --> 36:02.201
- Because of me?
- Of course 'cause ofyou.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.537
- No. Not because of me. Really?
- Yeah, for real. U h-huh.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.789
- Frank the fish?
- Frank the fish.

36:06.874 --> 36:08.541
- No.
- What?

36:08.625 --> 36:10.543
- H i. Hey.
- Hey.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.545
You should be at your desk,
shouldn't you?

36:12.629 --> 36:14.881
Dad, this is Tom,
one of our creative directors.

36:14.965 --> 36:18.634
- Tom, this is my dad, Frank.
- Hi, sir. N ice to meet you.

36:18.719 --> 36:21.888
- Tom.
- So, what are you up to?

36:21.972 --> 36:25.391
I was supposed to be heading out of town
to meet a client, but train got delayed.

36:25.476 --> 36:28.686
- Here. Why don't you sit down.
- No, no, no, no. I'd be interrupting.

36:28.771 --> 36:30.313
- No, it's fine. It's fine.
- Really?

36:30.397 --> 36:33.316
- Yeah. Sit down.
- Well, thank you.

36:34.151 --> 36:38.404
So, do you live here,
or are you just visiting?

36:38.489 --> 36:41.574
No, no. I'm just staying the one night.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.081
- Here. This is for you.
- What is it?

36:48.165 --> 36:50.249
- You'll see.
- Tell me.

36:50.334 --> 36:53.753
No, you'll see. You'll see. I didn't want
to send it in the mail. You'll see.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.380
Okay. You know what I'm trying to do?

36:56.465 --> 36:58.800
- I'm trying to get us all around the same table.
- The same table.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.927
Yeah. Like we used to at Christmas.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.807
- You happy?
- What do you mean?

37:05.891 --> 37:08.726
You happy?

37:08.811 --> 37:11.145
Yeah, of course I am. I'm—

37:12.231 --> 37:16.192
Good. Good. Good girl.

37:16.276 --> 37:19.487
A happy one. First one on my list.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.844
Isn't it terrible about Alice?

37:43.595 --> 37:47.098
- Alice?
- The storm sweeping up the coast.

37:50.102 --> 37:53.104
My name is Alice, so I took an interest.

37:56.108 --> 37:58.151
It's Greek, I think, Alice.

37:58.235 --> 38:01.362
- Is it Greek?
- It means "truth."

38:01.446 --> 38:03.364
Truth.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.410
Yeah, well, I heard about it.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.747
Was there a few days ago.
I must have just missed it.

38:11.832 --> 38:13.791
Well, you're lucky then.

38:13.876 --> 38:17.628
Well, I'm always lucky. I'm always lucky.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.599
Amy, have you seen David?

38:29.683 --> 38:32.476
- No, not yet.
- Why not?

38:32.561 --> 38:36.230
Well, I had an appointment with a guy
at the prison, but he didn't turn up.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.482
And I went to the embassy
and found a lawyer...

38:38.567 --> 38:40.484
but he can't meet till the morning.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.486
I've just been running around.

38:42.571 --> 38:45.823
Hopefully tomorrow I'll start to get
somewhere, and we can tell Dad.

38:45.908 --> 38:47.491
Okay.

38:47.576 --> 38:49.577
Look, I'll call you
as soon as I know what's going on.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.662
But listen. Don't worry. Okay?

38:52.664 --> 38:56.459
Oh, sweet morning

38:56.543 --> 39:01.505
Is your head not right

39:01.590 --> 39:05.676
Did you heed my warning

39:05.761 --> 39:08.512
This is the time

39:08.597 --> 39:11.682
Of times

39:11.767 --> 39:16.562
And your head feels like
your body

39:18.398 --> 39:21.400
Your mind is close behind

39:21.485 --> 39:25.529
There's a teardrop on your shoulder

39:25.614 --> 39:28.115
Says this is the time of times

39:28.200 --> 39:31.535
Could you take a picture of me
against the glass?

39:31.620 --> 39:36.457
It's the time of times again

39:36.541 --> 39:39.210
One more just to— Turn the—

39:39.294 --> 39:41.254
Could you— Yeah.

39:57.646 --> 40:00.022
Okay, everybody. It's a new day.

40:00.107 --> 40:02.566
An opportunity for all of us
to make amends.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.568
So why don't we start at the beginning.

40:04.653 --> 40:07.113
Horns, trumpets,
very percussive in the first section.

40:07.197 --> 40:10.658
Strings, more energy in those bows. Ready?

40:21.378 --> 40:24.839
- It's fine. I'll take you right through.
- Thank you.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.176
They're rehearsing right now.

41:51.718 --> 41:54.720
- Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?
- What am I doing?

41:54.805 --> 41:57.348
I've come to see you conduct.
What are you doing?

41:57.432 --> 41:59.725
I'm rehearsing.

41:59.810 --> 42:02.061
Aren't you conducting?

42:02.145 --> 42:05.231
Not today, no. I'm—

42:05.315 --> 42:07.858
- Playing the drum.
- I am.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.819
It's percussion.

42:10.529 --> 42:12.947
It's what I do.

42:13.990 --> 42:15.950
I thought you were conducting.

42:16.827 --> 42:19.829
Not today.
I'll explain. I should get back.

42:20.997 --> 42:22.998
You just walked off the stage
and nobody noticed?

42:24.376 --> 42:26.544
Come on, stop it. What are you doing here?

42:26.628 --> 42:29.130
I'm visiting. It's a surprise.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.757
I came to spend some time
with my son, the conductor.

42:33.677 --> 42:35.594
That's my cue.

42:35.679 --> 42:38.139
- Well, get back. Get back.
- Okay.

42:53.989 --> 42:56.365
That's very good.

42:56.450 --> 43:00.411
Very good, yeah. Never hit a drum
in my life, and suddenly I'm very good.

43:00.495 --> 43:05.374
Without training, without skill, without
all the musical talent that you have.

43:05.459 --> 43:08.043
Never said I was conducting, Dad.

43:08.128 --> 43:10.296
Yeah, well—

43:10.380 --> 43:11.881
But your mother said you were doing well...

43:11.965 --> 43:15.176
that you were conducting and composing
and doing your music.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.178
I am doing my music.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.222
It's percussion.
And it suits me just fine.

43:21.850 --> 43:24.935
But the drum?

43:25.020 --> 43:27.396
It's low pressure, and I enjoy it.

43:27.481 --> 43:32.067
I get to travel.
The money's fine. I got no ties.

43:33.320 --> 43:36.530
Everybody said that
you had a talent...

43:36.615 --> 43:38.157
that you had a future.

43:39.075 --> 43:41.368
People are polite, Dad. You know,
they don't always tell you the truth.

43:41.453 --> 43:44.872
The truth is,
I was never quite good enough.

43:48.376 --> 43:52.421
But all that education,
and now you're disappointed?

43:52.506 --> 43:54.882
I'm not disappointed.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.510
I'm not disappointed,
but you obviously are.

43:57.594 --> 44:00.888
No, I'm not disappointed.
It just seems like a waste. That's all.

44:00.972 --> 44:04.141
Of what? What's it a waste of?
Ofyour telephone wire?

44:04.226 --> 44:07.686
No, no, it's not that. I didn't say that.

44:07.771 --> 44:11.190
You know, I still compose,
and I conduct in my spare time.

44:11.274 --> 44:14.818
But nobody wants to employ me to do that
professionally. That's just the way it is.

44:14.903 --> 44:17.446
Well, I guess I'm just saying
that it's never too late.

44:17.531 --> 44:21.700
You could keep at it
and go back to studying.

44:21.785 --> 44:24.161
- I could help you out.
- It doesn't work like that, Dad.

44:24.246 --> 44:27.081
If it was going to have happened,
it would have happened by now.

44:28.500 --> 44:32.294
Besides, I'm not sure it's what I wanted.
I think maybe I was doin' it for you.

44:32.379 --> 44:34.296
I don't believe that.

44:34.381 --> 44:37.716
Dad, the point is, this suits me just fine.
This is what I want.

44:41.555 --> 44:44.056
Hey. Hey.

44:45.058 --> 44:48.185
You managing okay at home?

44:48.270 --> 44:50.187
Yeah, I'm cooking every day.

44:50.272 --> 44:53.524
Cooking? Yeah?
Do you know what you're doing?

44:53.608 --> 44:56.110
No, I just make it up.

44:57.821 --> 45:00.823
Well, I thought we could spend
a couple of days together.

45:01.533 --> 45:04.034
Dad, I fly to Europe this evening.

45:04.119 --> 45:07.204
It's a big trip.
We got to pack up this afternoon.

45:07.289 --> 45:09.373
I wish I could, honestly, but— you know.

45:09.457 --> 45:12.626
I'm sorry, Dad.
That would have been great.

45:17.215 --> 45:19.800
Well—

45:27.559 --> 45:31.020
I went to see David in New York.
Is he still at the same address?

45:32.105 --> 45:34.231
Yeah. I think so.

45:34.316 --> 45:37.401
Yeah, I want to check his address
and phone number with you.

45:37.485 --> 45:38.986
Sure.

45:40.905 --> 45:42.948
- I need some fresh air.
- All right.

45:49.122 --> 45:51.957
- Robert, come on. Don't smoke.
- What do you mean, don't smoke?

45:52.042 --> 45:55.836
Don't smoke.
You know better. Come on. Don't smoke.

45:57.964 --> 46:00.049
All right. I won't smoke.

46:00.133 --> 46:02.217
Not in front ofyou. Not if it upsets you.

46:02.302 --> 46:06.347
But, you know,
I do smoke sometimes, just so you know.

46:06.431 --> 46:08.349
Anyway, you used to smoke.

46:08.433 --> 46:11.644
I know I used to smoke.
That's when I didn't know any better. Now I do.

46:11.728 --> 46:13.646
Your mother made me stop too.

46:13.730 --> 46:17.066
You know, I will too.
But occasionally I do smoke.

46:17.150 --> 46:19.485
When I want to quit, I'll quit.

46:19.569 --> 46:22.279
- Hey, Robert.
- Hey, Dave.

46:22.364 --> 46:24.740
Let me get this straight.
You worked in a wire factory...

46:24.824 --> 46:26.909
smoking a couple of packs a day.

46:26.993 --> 46:29.078
But me being a percussionist...

46:29.162 --> 46:33.207
and having an occasional cigarette
isn't good enough for you?

46:33.291 --> 46:34.416
Come on.

46:36.503 --> 46:39.838
You know, Mom used to say, "Make your dad proud.
He works so hard for us."

46:39.923 --> 46:42.841
- And I know you're not proud of me. I know.
- That's not true.

46:42.926 --> 46:44.718
I can feel it. It's fine.

46:44.803 --> 46:47.304
I'm working hard here.
I'm doing the best I can.

46:47.389 --> 46:49.807
- Have your cigarette.
- What?

46:49.891 --> 46:51.892
Have your cigarette. You need it.

46:56.606 --> 46:58.565
No, you know what? I quit.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.820
- Hi, Robert.
- Hey. I just quit smoking.

47:02.904 --> 47:05.572
- Good job.
- Thanks.

47:05.657 --> 47:07.616
I'm not quitting because you want me to.

47:07.701 --> 47:10.869
I'm quitting 'cause
I know you don't think I can.

47:10.954 --> 47:13.539
J ust to make that clear, okay?

47:13.623 --> 47:15.165
Okay.

47:16.626 --> 47:18.836
Anyway, you sounded good on the drums.

47:18.920 --> 47:23.132
I missed a beat when I heard you coming in,
bumping your bag.

47:23.216 --> 47:25.551
You kind of threw me off there.

47:25.635 --> 47:28.721
Well, anyway,
what's a missed beat here and there?

47:28.805 --> 47:30.931
It's good. It sounded very good.

47:32.142 --> 47:33.142
Yeah.

47:34.144 --> 47:35.811
Thanks.

47:38.148 --> 47:41.859
We don't see each other very often.
I wasn't trying to—

47:41.943 --> 47:44.695
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, you know? I'm just—

47:44.779 --> 47:47.322
Look, you just gave up smoking.
You're gonna be a little edgy.

47:47.407 --> 47:50.534
Is that what it is?

47:50.618 --> 47:52.953
Well, anyway, I'm sorry.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.955
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.

47:57.083 --> 47:59.585
- Hey, James. I want to introduce you to my father.
- Of course.

47:59.669 --> 48:02.671
- This is James Green, famous conductor.
- Hi, James.

48:02.756 --> 48:05.883
- This is Frank, my dad— very famous dad.
- Hi.

48:05.967 --> 48:09.136
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you. Good luck with everything.

48:09.220 --> 48:12.306
- Thanks.
- All right. He's busy. He's—

48:14.642 --> 48:17.186
Got a girlfriend you want
to tell me about?

48:17.270 --> 48:20.981
There was someone up until recently.

48:21.065 --> 48:22.983
Not anymore?

48:23.067 --> 48:25.235
You know, she wanted to settle down.

48:25.320 --> 48:28.071
She started talking about babies.

48:28.156 --> 48:30.866
It's difficult with the traveling,
you know.

48:32.494 --> 48:36.288
- There's some girls in the orchestra.
- I noticed.

48:36.372 --> 48:38.791
Oh, yeah? You noticed, huh?

48:38.875 --> 48:41.794
- I got my eye on a couple of 'em.
- A couple, huh? Yeah.

48:43.505 --> 48:46.632
Well, you look after yourself, Robert.

48:46.716 --> 48:49.384
I'm getting the whole family together.

48:49.469 --> 48:52.179
Amy's gonna call you.
But if not, if she forgets...

48:52.263 --> 48:56.016
- you call her and you stay in touch with each other.
- I will. I will.

48:56.100 --> 48:57.976
And you're happy?

48:58.061 --> 49:04.024
Happy? Yeah. I get paid to bang a big,
loud drum all day. Of course I'm happy.

49:06.528 --> 49:08.195
Okay—

49:13.159 --> 49:15.869
Hey, I'm sorry that we couldn't
spend more time together.

49:28.007 --> 49:31.510
Maybe I'm wrong

49:33.555 --> 49:38.016
Amputate sympathy

49:39.185 --> 49:42.771
Strength of my tongue

49:44.274 --> 49:49.236
It's taken that liberty

49:50.738 --> 49:52.823
I don't know. He's—
I'm watching him right now.

49:52.907 --> 49:55.701
He's buying his ticket. He arrives
in Vegas at 1 0:00 tomorrow morning, okay?

49:55.785 --> 49:57.703
Okay. I'll be there.

49:57.787 --> 49:59.788
No, no, no.
He doesn't want you to meet him.

49:59.873 --> 50:02.833
- He wants it to be a surprise.
- Of course I'm gonna. If I want to, I'll meet him.

50:02.917 --> 50:05.335
Rosie, he doesn't—

50:05.420 --> 50:09.506
Okay. But, you know,
he's not gonna like it.

50:09.591 --> 50:12.009
How are you? Are you okay?

50:13.094 --> 50:15.429
Yeah, I guess.

50:15.513 --> 50:18.181
You know, I wanted
to spend some time with him.

50:18.266 --> 50:20.392
I'm free tonight or tomorrow,
but I just can't.

50:20.476 --> 50:23.854
I can't do it. I can't do it.
I don't know what to say to him.

50:23.938 --> 50:27.649
- I know. God, I know.
- Rosie.

50:27.734 --> 50:30.152
- What?
- He's asking about David.

50:30.236 --> 50:33.864
- Okay. I won't say anything.
- No, I mean, there's nothing to say.

50:33.948 --> 50:36.033
What are we gonna say?
We don't know anything.

50:36.117 --> 50:39.953
Play devil's advocate

50:41.331 --> 50:45.042
Never I fear

50:47.045 --> 50:51.256
Pay for it afterwards

50:55.386 --> 50:58.472
How do I feel

51:00.892 --> 51:04.645
A glorified refugee

51:05.813 --> 51:09.816
And nobody ever says

51:09.901 --> 51:12.402
Good-bye

51:15.156 --> 51:19.368
But I don't mind

51:21.371 --> 51:23.872
Just come home

51:26.709 --> 51:27.709
Come home

51:27.794 --> 51:29.544
Where you headin'?

51:29.629 --> 51:31.546
- Where you headin'?
- Las Vegas.

51:31.631 --> 51:34.466
Not from here you ain't. Not tonight.

51:34.550 --> 51:36.510
Let me see your ticket.

51:41.224 --> 51:44.059
- What time do you got?
- Five to 1 1 :00.

51:44.143 --> 51:48.271
The ticket office said that there was a bus
going to Las Vegas, Bay 3, at 1 1 :00.

51:48.356 --> 51:52.150
Well, now all we know for sure is that your watch
ain't being completely honest with you.

51:52.235 --> 51:54.778
There was a bus at 1 1 :00,
but now it's nearly 1 2:00.

51:54.862 --> 51:56.780
- 1 2:00?
- Where you just come from?

51:56.864 --> 51:59.741
New York through Chicago, Denver.

51:59.826 --> 52:02.744
Seems like you put your watch back
one too many times, my friend.

52:02.829 --> 52:07.040
There ain't no way you gonna catch a bus
that left here an hour ago.

52:07.125 --> 52:11.044
- There's no other bus.
- There's no other bus, not this time of night.

52:11.129 --> 52:14.381
There's a truck stop
a hundred yards up the road.

52:14.465 --> 52:18.427
Ifyou're lucky, you might pick up a lift
and catch the night train.

52:18.511 --> 52:20.429
Okay. Thank you.

52:26.060 --> 52:29.312
And all I'm wondering, why is this guy
trying to see his whole family...

52:29.397 --> 52:31.481
all over the country,
all in the same trip?

52:31.566 --> 52:36.111
- Well, I'm not dying, if that's what you're thinking.
- Hey, I'm not thinkin' anything.

52:36.195 --> 52:38.864
I'm just trying to visit the kids
and surprise them.

52:38.948 --> 52:42.159
Their mother's always kept
an eye on 'em, and...

52:42.243 --> 52:44.411
now it's up to me, so—

52:44.495 --> 52:47.664
- You lost your wife.
- About eight months ago.

52:47.749 --> 52:51.752
I lost my husband. J ust over a year now.

52:51.836 --> 52:54.504
I lost him to drink,
but it was my fault.

52:54.589 --> 52:56.506
I was stupid.

52:56.591 --> 52:58.925
Ignored all the signs,
you know how you do.

53:00.970 --> 53:03.597
I listen to that radio
all day in this cab.

53:03.681 --> 53:06.850
We got ourselves
an epidemic goin' on out there—

53:06.934 --> 53:11.271
you know, people eatin' too much,
drinkin' too much, killing themselves, basically...

53:11.355 --> 53:14.733
makin' up excuses all along the way.

53:14.817 --> 53:18.695
- I guess facing up to the truth ain't always easy.
- No.

53:18.780 --> 53:23.158
- Yeah, people like things easy. That's what they're used to.
- Yeah.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.993
No one likes to get hurt.

53:29.457 --> 53:30.457
No.

53:31.834 --> 53:33.752
Nobody likes to get hurt.

53:33.836 --> 53:38.256
I stop off in Reno. There's a night train from there,
gets you into Vegas in the morning.

53:38.341 --> 53:42.135
Otherwise, there's a cheap little motel
where I shut down ifyou don't wanna...

53:42.220 --> 53:44.930
travel through the night.

53:50.686 --> 53:53.271
Don't get all shy on me.
That wasn't a proposition.

53:53.356 --> 53:56.817
- No, I'm going to—
- Yeah. I sleep in the truck, all right?

54:03.032 --> 54:05.450
Take care, Frank.

54:05.535 --> 54:07.494
I appreciate it. Thank you.

54:36.149 --> 54:38.775
- Are you all right?
- Don't touch me.

54:38.860 --> 54:41.862
- I'm not touching anybody. I'm just—
- Don't touch me.

54:43.739 --> 54:44.865
You okay?

54:46.033 --> 54:48.618
Do your parents know where you are?

54:48.703 --> 54:53.165
- If I give you some money, will you eat something?
- Yeah, I'm clean, man.

54:53.249 --> 54:56.459
- Do you need some money?
- I could use some money.

54:56.544 --> 54:59.254
- I mean, everyone can use some money, right?
- Okay.

54:59.338 --> 55:01.631
Here—

55:01.716 --> 55:05.010
Here you go. Here.

55:07.805 --> 55:10.765
- You're okay?
- Yeah, what's with the questions?

55:10.850 --> 55:13.768
- You could say thank you.
- I could what?

55:13.853 --> 55:18.148
You could say thank you. I gave you some money.
You could say thank you.

55:18.232 --> 55:20.275
Hey, you're right.

55:20.359 --> 55:22.277
I'm sorry, man. You're right. Yeah, I—

55:22.361 --> 55:25.280
I forgot my manners. You got
a couple hundred dollars in there, and...

55:25.364 --> 55:27.073
this is my thanks.

55:42.173 --> 55:44.090
You need that?

55:46.219 --> 55:50.096
Please don't do anything.
I need— That's my medication.

55:51.098 --> 55:52.098
No—

56:05.196 --> 56:07.405
God, no.

56:46.487 --> 56:48.113
I'm not here at the moment...

56:48.197 --> 56:50.740
and Frank is probably in the garden.

56:50.825 --> 56:53.118
Leave a message, and I'll call you back.

57:44.253 --> 57:46.212
David.

57:48.549 --> 57:53.303
David? Of all my children, you're the one
that I worry about the most.

57:53.387 --> 57:54.596
I'm trying, Dad.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.518
- Dad!
- David!

58:01.645 --> 58:03.897
Tell me when I can see you.

58:09.862 --> 58:12.364
Dad!

58:21.248 --> 58:23.792
- Robert, Dad wasn't on the bus.
- What?

58:23.876 --> 58:27.003
I met the 1 0:00 bus like you said,
and everyone else got off...

58:27.088 --> 58:29.005
but he's not on it.

58:29.090 --> 58:32.008
Well—
Well, did you look in the station?

58:32.093 --> 58:34.260
- I mean, where have you looked?
- Yeah, of course. I looked everywhere.

58:34.970 --> 58:38.056
I don't know what to tell you.
He was due on the 1 0:00.

58:38.140 --> 58:40.100
So how can he not be on it?

58:41.769 --> 58:44.604
- Are you all right, Frank?
- Listen. The damnedest thing happened.

58:44.688 --> 58:46.856
I was brushing my teeth this morning...

58:46.941 --> 58:49.818
and I left my bottle of pills
right on the edge ofthe sink.

58:49.902 --> 58:53.530
Well, I knocked the whole thing right into the sink,
and it got all wet. There's nothing left.

58:53.614 --> 58:56.699
- The sink? Geez. Goddamn it. You're as bad as me.
- The sink. The damnedest thing.

58:56.784 --> 59:00.412
I'll write a new prescription, all right?
Just pop in. I'll leave it in the reception.

59:00.496 --> 59:05.708
Is that the only way to get them,
to go to reception? I have to come—

59:05.793 --> 59:08.962
I have to come in?
No, the garden is doing great. I'm—

59:09.046 --> 59:11.548
It's doing— I'm looking right at it.

59:11.632 --> 59:13.591
Looking really good. Really good.

59:17.471 --> 59:20.849
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. You home?

59:20.933 --> 59:23.643
No. I'm waiting for you. Where are you?

59:23.727 --> 59:25.687
- He told you I was coming, didn't he?
- No.

59:25.771 --> 59:29.149
I told him not to tell you
I was coming, and he told you.

59:43.706 --> 59:46.291
- Hi, Dad.
- Yeah. Hi, glamour girl.

59:50.004 --> 59:51.963
- Welcome to Vegas, Dad.
- Yeah, thanks.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.260
Papa loves mambo

59:57.344 --> 59:59.304
I didn't order a stretch.

59:59.388 --> 1:00:01.389
I just wanted something comfortable.

1:00:01.474 --> 1:00:03.850
Good. No, it's got plenty
of leg room, that's for sure.

1:00:03.934 --> 1:00:06.311
That's why they call it a stretch?

1:00:06.395 --> 1:00:08.563
- I missed you.
- Oh, I miss you.

1:00:08.647 --> 1:00:12.192
- I've been worried about you.
- Don't. No. Tell me about your show.

1:00:12.276 --> 1:00:15.278
- Okay. We were at the Bellagio—
- Uh-huh.

1:00:15.362 --> 1:00:17.614
and it was a big production...

1:00:17.698 --> 1:00:20.617
- lots of underwater dance scenes.
- Uh-huh.

1:00:20.701 --> 1:00:23.328
And I was the mermaid, the lead.

1:00:23.412 --> 1:00:25.830
- Of course.
- And you would've loved it.

1:00:25.915 --> 1:00:29.667
- When could I go?
- It finished last week.

1:00:29.752 --> 1:00:31.252
- It finished?
- Yeah.

1:00:31.337 --> 1:00:34.672
Next time you have to fly out
and come see me. I just—

1:00:34.757 --> 1:00:38.468
I didn't want to bother you this time,
because I knew that you weren't feeling well.

1:00:38.552 --> 1:00:40.803
- But look at you.
- No, look at you.

1:00:40.888 --> 1:00:44.599
A dancer in a Las Vegas show on the big stage?
Just what you always wanted.

1:00:44.683 --> 1:00:46.643
Are you happy?

1:00:46.727 --> 1:00:48.645
- Very happy.
- Yeah?

1:00:48.729 --> 1:00:52.774
So, the only thing missing now
is— anything?

1:00:52.858 --> 1:00:55.026
- A man. I know.
- Well—

1:00:55.110 --> 1:00:58.112
- Papa loves mambo
- Papa loves mambo

1:00:58.197 --> 1:01:01.074
- Mama loves mambo
- Mama loves mambo

1:01:01.158 --> 1:01:03.952
Havin' their fling again
Younger than spring again

1:01:04.036 --> 1:01:06.496
Feelin' that zing again, wow

1:01:06.580 --> 1:01:08.581
This is where you live?

1:01:08.666 --> 1:01:12.418
- No, this is an elevator.
- Very good.

1:01:12.503 --> 1:01:16.005
I think you'll like the apartment.
It's very spacious.

1:01:16.090 --> 1:01:18.633
- Well, I'm happy sleeping on a couch.
- Really?

1:01:18.717 --> 1:01:20.760
- Really.
- Okay.

1:01:24.807 --> 1:01:26.766
- Wow.
- You like it?

1:01:26.850 --> 1:01:28.810
- It's—
- Very me?

1:01:28.894 --> 1:01:31.271
Very you. Very impressive.

1:01:35.651 --> 1:01:38.486
- Well, do you want to see your room?
- Sure.

1:01:38.571 --> 1:01:40.989
Okay. Come on.

1:01:41.073 --> 1:01:46.202
So, bed or sofa? Sofa or bed?

1:01:46.287 --> 1:01:48.079
This is my room.

1:01:48.581 --> 1:01:50.456
It's huge.

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:53.543
- Look at that television.
- I know.

1:01:53.627 --> 1:01:56.462
I booked us dinner at a place
called the Stratosphere.

1:01:56.547 --> 1:01:58.464
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

1:01:58.549 --> 1:02:03.219
- It's a revolving restaurant 800 feet above the ground.
- No, stay just like that.

1:02:03.304 --> 1:02:04.804
Okay.

1:02:04.888 --> 1:02:06.764
Okay. One more time.

1:02:06.849 --> 1:02:09.017
I'll just get that.
Stay there. I'll be right back.

1:02:09.101 --> 1:02:11.019
Okay. Just gonna take another picture.

1:02:13.022 --> 1:02:15.690
- Jilly, hi.
- H i. How are you?

1:02:15.774 --> 1:02:17.734
- Good. Come on in. I want—
- I need a favor.

1:02:17.818 --> 1:02:20.653
I have to go pick up Paul from the airport,
and I haven't got the car seat.

1:02:20.738 --> 1:02:22.697
- I want you to meet my dad.
- Oh, great. Hi.

1:02:22.781 --> 1:02:24.907
- H i.
- Dad...

1:02:24.992 --> 1:02:26.951
this is my friend J illy.

1:02:27.036 --> 1:02:28.536
- Hi.
- What?

1:02:28.621 --> 1:02:30.830
- J illy. It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hi, J illy.

1:02:30.914 --> 1:02:33.958
- How you doin'?
- How are you doing? Who's this guy?

1:02:34.043 --> 1:02:36.794
This is Max,
and we could really use a favor.

1:02:36.879 --> 1:02:39.422
Could you watch him for a few hours?

1:02:39.506 --> 1:02:42.967
Yeah, well, the only thing is that we
were gonna head out later for dinner.

1:02:43.052 --> 1:02:45.970
You know? It's fine. I'm gonna pop downstairs.
I can see if Helen's around.

1:02:46.055 --> 1:02:49.265
- We could stay in, ifyou want.
- I think you guys should go out. It's your-

1:02:49.350 --> 1:02:52.769
- No, you're tired. It's fine.
- I'm easy. I'm easy. Whatever. Whatever it is.

1:02:52.853 --> 1:02:56.022
- We'll take him. Here. Give him to me.
- You sure? Oh, thank you so much.

1:02:56.106 --> 1:02:58.691
I should be back in time
for you guys to go out anyway.

1:02:58.776 --> 1:03:00.985
It'll just be a couple of hours.
But thank you again.

1:03:03.405 --> 1:03:05.948
Okay— Yeah, it's fine.

1:03:06.033 --> 1:03:08.117
Well, I can bathe him.

1:03:08.702 --> 1:03:11.621
Okay. I'll call
if I need anything, honestly.

1:03:11.705 --> 1:03:15.041
I'll be all right. Okay.

1:03:15.125 --> 1:03:16.709
Bye.

1:03:17.795 --> 1:03:20.296
Slight problem.

1:03:20.381 --> 1:03:22.298
- Jilly?
- Yeah.

1:03:22.383 --> 1:03:24.967
Paul's flight was canceled—

1:03:25.052 --> 1:03:27.679
so he's stuck in LA,
and she's going to pick him up.

1:03:27.763 --> 1:03:30.973
So that means we have Max for the night.

1:03:31.058 --> 1:03:32.975
Okay.

1:03:33.060 --> 1:03:36.354
- Is that okay?
- It's okay.

1:03:36.438 --> 1:03:39.482
What's the matter? What's the matter?

1:04:15.310 --> 1:04:19.063
Okay, just stay up.
Give me your arm.

1:04:19.148 --> 1:04:22.525
- Do you want me to get that?
- No, Dad, just leave it. It's fine.

1:04:22.609 --> 1:04:25.945
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1:04:27.406 --> 1:04:31.951
Hi. I'm not here right now,
so please leave me a message.

1:04:33.704 --> 1:04:37.540
It's me. Look, I need the apartment back
sooner than I thought...

1:04:37.624 --> 1:04:40.793
so call me.

1:04:41.879 --> 1:04:44.338
Stop splashing.

1:05:01.815 --> 1:05:03.941
A nice apartment.

1:05:04.026 --> 1:05:07.487
Yeah, it's a little big though.

1:05:07.571 --> 1:05:11.324
- You bought it?
- No, I'm renting it, but I got a good deal.

1:05:18.207 --> 1:05:21.459
Listen. I'm gonna leave tomorrow.
I'm gonna go back home.

1:05:21.543 --> 1:05:25.213
- But you just got here.
- I know, but it's been a long trip.

1:05:25.297 --> 1:05:28.758
I'm running low on my medication.
I just thought I would—

1:05:28.842 --> 1:05:31.427
Well, can't we get you a refill?

1:05:33.013 --> 1:05:35.640
It's been a long trip, honey.

1:05:39.353 --> 1:05:42.146
Yeah. You look tired.

1:05:42.231 --> 1:05:44.982
I'm okay. I should get home.

1:05:45.067 --> 1:05:46.859
Would you be okay with that?

1:05:48.362 --> 1:05:50.738
Yeah— Of course.

1:05:50.823 --> 1:05:53.825
You should do what you want.

1:05:53.909 --> 1:05:55.910
Here, take that.

1:05:59.498 --> 1:06:01.541
I was thinking of flying.

1:06:01.625 --> 1:06:03.876
- You never fly.
- I know.

1:06:11.009 --> 1:06:13.010
Thank you.

1:06:14.805 --> 1:06:16.806
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:06:20.978 --> 1:06:23.396
You didn't really want
to eat out, did you?

1:06:24.898 --> 1:06:29.569
No, I didn't, not 800 feet above the ground
in a revolving restaurant.

1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:40.746
Remember when your mother
taught you how to eat spaghetti?

1:06:42.541 --> 1:06:44.000
Yep.

1:06:49.006 --> 1:06:52.675
Sometimes I pick up the phone
to dial her number...

1:06:52.759 --> 1:06:54.635
and then I remember.

1:06:57.264 --> 1:06:59.223
Keep calling next time.

1:06:59.308 --> 1:07:02.184
The number's still the same,
and I'm still on the other end.

1:07:03.186 --> 1:07:05.062
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1:07:05.147 --> 1:07:07.148
- Yes.
- I don't know what it is with you kids.

1:07:07.232 --> 1:07:09.692
You always told your mother everything.
You never told me anything.

1:07:09.776 --> 1:07:11.694
You were always on the phone with her.

1:07:12.946 --> 1:07:16.324
I'd pick up the phone. I'd say hello,
you'd say, "H i, Dad. Mom there?"

1:07:16.408 --> 1:07:19.952
It wasn't that bad. It was just that...

1:07:20.037 --> 1:07:23.873
Mom was easier to talk to, and you always worried
so much if everything wasn't perfect.

1:07:23.957 --> 1:07:25.833
No. That's not true.

1:07:27.878 --> 1:07:29.795
We could just talk to Mom.

1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:33.382
- Oh, but you couldn't talk to me?
- Well, she was a good listener.

1:07:33.467 --> 1:07:35.509
You were a good talker.

1:07:35.594 --> 1:07:37.678
Well, so that's good. We made a good team.

1:07:38.972 --> 1:07:40.640
Yeah.

1:07:42.059 --> 1:07:45.144
You wouldn't change anything, would you?

1:07:46.688 --> 1:07:48.773
You pushed us pretty hard.

1:07:48.857 --> 1:07:52.985
No. That's not true.

1:07:54.321 --> 1:07:56.948
You didn't all
feel that way, did you?

1:07:57.032 --> 1:08:00.326
I think David felt it the most.

1:08:01.328 --> 1:08:03.329
Yeah.

1:08:07.459 --> 1:08:08.960
I can see that.

1:08:09.836 --> 1:08:12.922
He so never wanted to let you down.

1:08:14.007 --> 1:08:18.135
I know. I was never any harder
on him as far as I could see.

1:08:18.220 --> 1:08:20.763
You were all different,
and look at him today.

1:08:22.641 --> 1:08:25.851
- Did I tell you I went to see him in New York?
- No.

1:08:25.936 --> 1:08:28.145
Yeah. He wasn't there,
but I saw some of his artwork...

1:08:28.230 --> 1:08:30.147
downstairs in the gallery
below his apartment.

1:08:30.232 --> 1:08:32.692
It was right there on display.
It was just... beautiful.

1:08:34.361 --> 1:08:37.405
So look what happened to him.
He turned out okay.

1:08:37.489 --> 1:08:39.448
You turned out okay.

1:08:39.533 --> 1:08:42.660
I don't know, Dad.

1:08:42.744 --> 1:08:45.371
How can you say that? Look at you.

1:08:45.455 --> 1:08:48.958
You've wanted to be a dancer
ever since you were a little girl.

1:08:49.042 --> 1:08:51.752
You were gifted, and nobody pushed you.

1:08:51.837 --> 1:08:53.879
- What about your plans?
- It all worked out.

1:08:53.964 --> 1:08:56.424
What did you want to be
when you were my age?

1:08:57.509 --> 1:08:59.635
I didn't have any plans.

1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:04.223
I just wanted to hold down a job and find somebody
crazy enough to marry me— your mother.

1:09:04.975 --> 1:09:09.020
I don't know. But when you guys came along,
things were different.

1:09:09.104 --> 1:09:12.314
There were opportunities. What kind of father
would I have been if I hadn't pushed you?

1:09:12.399 --> 1:09:15.401
So there wasn't anything
you wanted to achieve?

1:09:15.485 --> 1:09:20.614
No, I didn't really think much about it.
I never really gave it much thought.

1:09:20.699 --> 1:09:24.160
All I wanted to do was just be
a good father, that's all.

1:09:36.006 --> 1:09:38.049
- You've got your boarding pass.
- All right.

1:09:38.133 --> 1:09:42.845
And you're all checked in,
and we know your gate.

1:09:42.929 --> 1:09:44.847
So?

1:09:44.931 --> 1:09:48.142
- I'll come visit you as soon as I can. I promise.
- Oh, I'd like that.

1:09:48.226 --> 1:09:51.520
I wanna get us all around
the same table together.

1:09:51.605 --> 1:09:54.398
- At Christmas.
- Or before. It's up to you.

1:09:54.483 --> 1:09:57.359
Great. Count me in.

1:09:57.444 --> 1:10:01.197
Here.

1:10:01.281 --> 1:10:05.367
- What's this?
- I had to give it to each ofyou.

1:10:05.452 --> 1:10:07.995
- Well, shall I open it?
- No, open it later.

1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:11.207
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure.

1:10:11.291 --> 1:10:16.295
Okay.

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:22.968
- Be good.
- J ust for you.

1:10:26.556 --> 1:10:29.058
- Be good.
- I will.

1:10:42.322 --> 1:10:43.823
Bye, Dad.

1:10:54.042 --> 1:10:56.043
Have a good flight.

1:11:21.153 --> 1:11:22.778
Rosie, where's Dad?

1:11:22.863 --> 1:11:25.614
He's on his way home. I just left him.

1:11:25.699 --> 1:11:27.950
What did you find out?

1:11:28.034 --> 1:11:30.870
David was caught
buying some drugs in a bar.

1:11:30.954 --> 1:11:33.622
- No!
- And he got sick so quickly that they now think...

1:11:33.707 --> 1:11:36.625
he may have panicked and swallowed some of
the drugs when he was arrested.

1:11:36.710 --> 1:11:40.921
- Is he okay? Have you seen him?
- Not yet. He was taken to a hospital.

1:11:41.006 --> 1:11:44.675
- I'm there now, but they're not being very helpful.
- What do you mean?

1:11:44.759 --> 1:11:47.636
I keep asking if he's here,
but I can't get a straight answer.

1:11:47.721 --> 1:11:50.639
Listen. The lawyer's with me, and the guy
from the embassy's here.

1:11:50.724 --> 1:11:55.227
Call Robert. I promised I'd call him
before his concert, tell him what's going on.

1:11:55.312 --> 1:11:57.521
Can you do that for me?

1:11:57.606 --> 1:11:59.607
Yeah.

1:12:12.871 --> 1:12:16.790
Excuse me.
How much longer before we land?

1:12:16.875 --> 1:12:20.252
Forty minutes. But there's a storm,
so it might take a little longer.

1:12:20.337 --> 1:12:24.340
- A storm?
- It's okay. We go around it, not through it.

1:12:24.424 --> 1:12:27.301
- Can I have some more water please?
- Sure.

1:12:33.266 --> 1:12:34.808
Excuse me.

1:12:46.279 --> 1:12:49.531
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain
has turned on the seat belt sign...

1:12:49.616 --> 1:12:52.952
so we ask that you please
return to your seats as soon as possible.

1:12:57.499 --> 1:13:00.793
Sir, you need to push
your table up. Thank you.

1:13:08.802 --> 1:13:10.552
Sir, is everything all right?

1:13:20.355 --> 1:13:23.649
Sir, okay. Sir? Sir, you're gonna be fine.

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:25.651
You're gonna be fine. J ust breathe for me.

1:13:25.735 --> 1:13:27.444
You're gonna be fine.

1:13:29.656 --> 1:13:32.866
Come on. It's ready. Everybody sit down.

1:13:32.951 --> 1:13:34.868
Hey, David? Come on.

1:13:35.912 --> 1:13:37.788
Thank you.

1:13:38.999 --> 1:13:40.916
How come you're home, Dad?

1:13:41.001 --> 1:13:43.836
- I took the day offwork.
- But you'd never do that.

1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:46.672
I know, but I wanted to spend
some time with you guys.

1:13:46.756 --> 1:13:49.883
- Is anything wrong?
- No, nothing is wrong.

1:13:49.968 --> 1:13:53.679
Well, you know, actually,
there is something.

1:13:55.181 --> 1:13:57.349
You know, I've been
asking myself a question.

1:13:57.434 --> 1:14:00.477
It's been like a puzzle,
and I can't figure it out.

1:14:00.562 --> 1:14:02.855
Let's stop eating for a minute.

1:14:06.443 --> 1:14:11.989
I keep asking myself why you all lied to me.
All ofyou.

1:14:12.073 --> 1:14:16.452
Amy, Jeffwore the same shirt to work
the morning after I stayed.

1:14:16.536 --> 1:14:18.203
He doesn't live with you anymore, does he?

1:14:19.873 --> 1:14:22.124
He left home about three months ago.

1:14:22.208 --> 1:14:24.877
There's another woman.
That's whyJack hates him.

1:14:24.961 --> 1:14:28.005
When that man Tom came over to me
at the station and shook my hand...

1:14:28.089 --> 1:14:30.424
he wanted to make
an impression, didn't he?

1:14:30.508 --> 1:14:33.385
You pulled that chair out before he came over
'cause you were expecting him.

1:14:33.470 --> 1:14:35.387
Tom was waiting at the station.

1:14:35.472 --> 1:14:39.391
I wanted to know that you'd met him.
I didn't want to miss the opportunity.

1:14:39.476 --> 1:14:43.520
In case I get sick
and we never get the chance to meet?

1:14:53.281 --> 1:14:56.700
- Robert—
- I think we should go in. I think I felt some rain.

1:14:56.785 --> 1:14:59.161
There were posters all over the city.
You weren't going to Europe.

1:14:59.245 --> 1:15:02.039
You weren't even performing that night.
We could have spent time together.

1:15:02.123 --> 1:15:05.292
- But you lied to me. You didn't wanna be with me.
- The truth is, Dad...

1:15:05.377 --> 1:15:07.920
there are lots of things
that we don't tell you.

1:15:08.505 --> 1:15:10.881
But that doesn't mean
that we want to hurt you.

1:15:10.965 --> 1:15:12.674
Mom didn't always tell you everything,
and you know that.

1:15:12.759 --> 1:15:16.220
Don't blame your mother for this.
And wipe your mouth.

1:15:17.764 --> 1:15:20.557
Rosie, the baby is yours, isn't it?

1:15:23.436 --> 1:15:25.396
I was goin' to tell you.

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:27.564
Go on.

1:15:27.649 --> 1:15:30.109
- Tell him the rest.
- Robert, shut up.

1:15:30.193 --> 1:15:32.861
- Go on. I'll tell him.
- Shut up.

1:15:32.946 --> 1:15:37.449
- She doesn't know if she likes boys or girls.
- Robert, stop it.

1:15:37.534 --> 1:15:39.451
Did your mother know you were pregnant?

1:15:41.913 --> 1:15:44.915
And she kept it from me.
Why would she do that?

1:15:44.999 --> 1:15:46.500
We were goin' to tell you...

1:15:46.584 --> 1:15:49.962
but then Mom got sick...

1:15:50.046 --> 1:15:52.297
and I didn't want to disappoint you.

1:15:55.927 --> 1:16:01.265
David, do you still live in New York
at that apartment?

1:16:01.349 --> 1:16:03.475
- No.
- Then where can I find you?

1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:04.560
I can't tell you.

1:16:04.644 --> 1:16:07.229
Tell me where I can find you
and when I can see you.

1:16:07.313 --> 1:16:10.774
- I don't want to see you, Dad.
- Then stop— Do not laugh at me.

1:16:12.068 --> 1:16:13.193
Tell me the truth.

1:16:14.821 --> 1:16:18.323
And wipe that smirk offyour face.
Wipe the smirk offyour face.

1:16:18.408 --> 1:16:21.577
I have your skateboard in the shed there.
I know exactly where it is.

1:16:21.661 --> 1:16:23.787
I'll burn the damn thing, you hear me?

1:16:23.872 --> 1:16:26.874
- You took my forward wheels.
- Don't laugh. Don't laugh! Quiet!

1:16:26.958 --> 1:16:30.377
After everything I've done for you,
this is all you can do— is laugh?

1:16:30.462 --> 1:16:33.922
When I'm asking you about
something that's worrying me?

1:16:34.007 --> 1:16:36.425
Jesus! David.

1:16:36.509 --> 1:16:40.721
Your mother always asked me why I was
so hard on you. This is why. This is exactly why!

1:16:40.805 --> 1:16:43.307
Have some respect!

1:16:55.361 --> 1:16:57.654
So what am I supposed to do?

1:16:57.739 --> 1:17:01.658
Act as though nothing's wrong.
That's what Mom did. It's best for all of us.

1:17:01.743 --> 1:17:05.037
I can't do that. I can't act as if nothing happened.
What do I tell your mother?

1:17:05.163 --> 1:17:08.916
- What do I say?
- Anyway, she won't ask you anything, 'cause she's dead.

1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:10.417
David!

1:17:19.344 --> 1:17:23.222
- That's it. I've had enough. I'm outta here.
- Me too. I'm outta here.

1:17:23.306 --> 1:17:24.806
Come on!

1:17:26.643 --> 1:17:29.478
- Tell her nothing.
- How can I do that?

1:17:29.562 --> 1:17:32.523
Ifyou love her as she loves you...

1:17:32.607 --> 1:17:35.442
then you'll tell her
what she wants to hear.

1:17:35.527 --> 1:17:38.195
Tell her that we're all fine.

1:18:41.175 --> 1:18:43.176
Dad.

1:19:05.617 --> 1:19:09.828
At last.
Finally have my family in the same room.

1:19:12.665 --> 1:19:16.418
- Is David here?
- Rosie's here, and Robert.

1:19:16.502 --> 1:19:19.713
- How are you feeling?
- Was it a heart attack?

1:19:19.797 --> 1:19:22.341
They're not sure.

1:19:23.426 --> 1:19:25.344
Amy, is he telling the truth?

1:19:25.428 --> 1:19:27.763
The doctors are waiting
for some test results.

1:19:27.847 --> 1:19:32.017
Oh, come on. Don't lie to me.

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:37.689
Why do I always find it so hard
to believe all ofyou now? Come on.

1:19:39.442 --> 1:19:41.693
They suspected a heart attack.

1:19:41.778 --> 1:19:44.988
They ran some tests...

1:19:45.073 --> 1:19:48.659
and they got the results.

1:19:48.743 --> 1:19:51.078
And it was a heart attack.

1:19:51.162 --> 1:19:55.666
- A mild one.
- Good. A start, at least.

1:19:55.750 --> 1:19:59.127
I didn't want to worry you
until you had a chance to...

1:19:59.212 --> 1:20:01.171
come to terms with what happened.

1:20:02.507 --> 1:20:05.467
You can worry me, all ofyou.

1:20:05.551 --> 1:20:08.720
I'm a father of four. I expect that.

1:20:08.805 --> 1:20:13.350
I know you all had problems.

1:20:14.811 --> 1:20:18.855
I know that, and I can see you've been
keeping things from me.

1:20:18.940 --> 1:20:23.110
- But right now there's something that I need—
- Dad, maybe you should rest.

1:20:23.194 --> 1:20:27.322
No, I will rest,
but I need an answer to a question.

1:20:27.407 --> 1:20:31.243
You were honest with your mother,
and I want you to be honest with me.

1:20:32.286 --> 1:20:35.747
It's all right, you know. I'm okay.

1:20:36.791 --> 1:20:38.792
I can handle it.

1:20:38.876 --> 1:20:42.629
I know David is in trouble...

1:20:42.714 --> 1:20:45.924
and I just want to know where he is...

1:20:47.301 --> 1:20:50.721
and how soon I can see him.

1:20:52.473 --> 1:20:55.350
So, who's gonna tell me?

1:20:55.435 --> 1:20:58.729
Why don't you take it—
Why don't you rest for a while?

1:20:59.731 --> 1:21:02.232
What is it?

1:21:05.737 --> 1:21:07.738
J ust tell me the truth.

1:21:09.115 --> 1:21:10.949
Dad, I'm sorry.

1:21:14.787 --> 1:21:16.955
David died, Dad.

1:21:17.749 --> 1:21:19.750
I'm sorry.

1:21:21.961 --> 1:21:25.797
No. That's not true.
Tell me that's not true.

1:21:25.882 --> 1:21:29.551
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- No.

1:21:29.635 --> 1:21:33.472
- He moved out of his apartment, and—
- No.

1:21:33.556 --> 1:21:35.849
we knew that he was traveling.

1:21:35.933 --> 1:21:39.811
And then we started
getting calls from Mexico.

1:21:39.896 --> 1:21:44.566
There was a lot of confusion.
We didn't want to tell you until we were sure.

1:21:45.568 --> 1:21:48.111
No. No. I—

1:21:48.196 --> 1:21:50.363
- He had a lot of problems.
- No. No.

1:21:50.448 --> 1:21:55.202
He wasn't happy, Dad.
He's been havin' a tough time since Mom died.

1:21:55.286 --> 1:21:57.954
We've all been worried about him.

1:21:58.039 --> 1:22:00.916
Yeah, but, you—

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.126
Not for sure, I mean—

1:22:03.211 --> 1:22:06.505
It was Mexico. It could be anyone.
It could be a mistake.

1:22:06.589 --> 1:22:08.507
- They-
- It could be.

1:22:08.591 --> 1:22:14.221
I flew out there after you visited.

1:22:14.305 --> 1:22:18.183
That's why you couldn't stay.
That's why we all made excuses.

1:22:18.267 --> 1:22:21.269
No. No. Wrong—

1:22:21.354 --> 1:22:24.981
Not my son. That's not my son.

1:22:27.527 --> 1:22:28.860
No.

1:22:31.572 --> 1:22:34.199
They said it was an overdose.

1:22:41.958 --> 1:22:46.837
No. Not my son.
That's not my son.

1:22:46.921 --> 1:22:47.921
No.

1:23:17.243 --> 1:23:20.370
- What are you gonna do when you grow up?
- I want to be a painter and do my pictures.

1:23:20.454 --> 1:23:23.498
No, not a painter. Painters paint walls,
and dogs pee on walls.

1:23:23.583 --> 1:23:25.542
You're gonna be an artist.

1:23:25.626 --> 1:23:27.586
- You're gonna work hard?
- Yes, Dad.

1:23:27.670 --> 1:23:29.921
You gonna make me proud?

1:23:36.804 --> 1:23:39.931
I'm sorry about how
everything's worked out, Dad.

1:23:45.438 --> 1:23:48.273
It's not your fault.

1:23:53.237 --> 1:23:56.573
I've been thinkin'
about what I wanna do when I grow up.

1:23:56.657 --> 1:24:01.745
- Yeah? But what did you decide?
- I might still be an artist...

1:24:01.829 --> 1:24:04.998
or I might just do a normal job,
like a painter.

1:24:06.459 --> 1:24:10.211
- I'd be proud ofyou no matter what you did.
- Really?

1:24:10.296 --> 1:24:12.297
Really.

1:24:13.966 --> 1:24:15.967
Good.

1:24:18.804 --> 1:24:21.139
I told Mom I wouldn't be long.

1:24:23.559 --> 1:24:27.604
- Give her my love.
- I will.

1:24:29.857 --> 1:24:31.858
Well, I'll see you, Dad.

1:24:34.070 --> 1:24:35.445
David.

1:24:37.949 --> 1:24:39.574
I'm sorry.

1:24:43.955 --> 1:24:46.081
It's not your fault, Dad.

1:24:52.213 --> 1:24:58.843
David?

1:27:31.664 --> 1:27:34.624
Well, it was a big trip...

1:27:34.708 --> 1:27:38.878
and ifyou asked me what I've learned,
I'd have to tell you I'm not sure.

1:27:38.963 --> 1:27:45.176
I know if I could do it all over again,
I would ask less of the kids.

1:27:45.261 --> 1:27:48.138
As long as they were happy,
that would be fine with me.

1:27:50.266 --> 1:27:53.059
I know I have to stop thinking of them as
if they're still children.

1:27:53.144 --> 1:27:55.061
I can't tell them what to do anymore.

1:27:55.146 --> 1:27:57.772
They have to find their own way.

1:27:57.857 --> 1:27:59.440
And...

1:28:00.192 --> 1:28:01.818
sometimes...

1:28:03.112 --> 1:28:06.322
you talked to me about things
that I should have listened to you more carefully.

1:28:07.867 --> 1:28:11.661
You presented me with the details
of our children's lives...

1:28:14.373 --> 1:28:17.333
and I ignored them.

1:28:18.878 --> 1:28:20.879
And for that—

1:28:27.678 --> 1:28:30.972
But that isn't what you want to hear.
I know. What you want is the news.

1:28:31.056 --> 1:28:34.434
Well, the news is this:

1:28:34.518 --> 1:28:38.479
Robert, Amy and Rosie promised
to visit me for the holidays.

1:28:38.564 --> 1:28:41.566
And you know what?
This time I believe them.

1:28:42.735 --> 1:28:44.235
And David—

1:28:44.904 --> 1:28:45.904
David—

1:28:48.199 --> 1:28:50.283
I hope will spend Christmas with you.

1:28:57.708 --> 1:29:01.252
I went back to New York
to buy David's painting.

1:29:02.796 --> 1:29:05.924
The portrait— I know which one you mean,
but I'm afraid it's sold.

1:29:06.008 --> 1:29:08.009
It is sold?

1:29:12.264 --> 1:29:14.015
Were you familiar with the artist?

1:29:14.099 --> 1:29:18.770
Yeah, not as much as I would like
to have been, but yes.

1:29:18.854 --> 1:29:21.564
- Thank you.
- Why don't you give me your details?

1:29:21.649 --> 1:29:24.609
If anything of David's comes in,
I'll let you know.

1:29:26.528 --> 1:29:28.446
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:29:29.949 --> 1:29:32.617
I just saw your name.
I'm stupid. I should have realized.

1:29:32.701 --> 1:29:34.577
That's okay.

1:29:35.829 --> 1:29:37.330
I'm sorry.

1:29:38.874 --> 1:29:42.210
You know, I knew David. He used to hang out
at the gallery all the time...

1:29:42.294 --> 1:29:46.965
and he used to say that if it wasn't for his dad,
that he never would've become an artist.

1:29:47.841 --> 1:29:51.177
He said he would've ended up painting
walls and that dogs pee on walls.

1:29:53.305 --> 1:29:56.975
Look, we might have something of his
in storage. I can check ifyou'd like.

1:29:57.685 --> 1:30:00.144
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay.

1:30:00.229 --> 1:30:03.439
And I won't pretend David's work
was very commercial—

1:30:04.316 --> 1:30:05.817
Oh, here it is.

1:30:07.278 --> 1:30:08.820
He had his own style...

1:30:09.571 --> 1:30:11.489
and he wasn't concerned with fashion...

1:30:18.872 --> 1:30:20.623
but for what it's worth...

1:30:21.834 --> 1:30:23.626
I thought he was really special.

1:30:41.312 --> 1:30:42.812
Thank you.

1:30:51.530 --> 1:30:54.615
Hello, this is Frank.
I'm not out—

1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:58.286
I mean—
I'm not here at the moment.

1:30:58.370 --> 1:31:02.040
I'm probably out shopping
for the holidays...

1:31:02.124 --> 1:31:04.292
but ifyou leave a message,
I will call you back.

1:31:04.376 --> 1:31:05.543
Thank you.

1:31:07.087 --> 1:31:10.131
Don't laugh, but I promised to cook
the turkey for the first time this year-

1:31:10.215 --> 1:31:12.759
Got the whole family coming.
What's the biggest bird you got?

1:31:12.843 --> 1:31:16.763
- Half a dozen of-
- and treat the children to some expensive wine.

1:31:16.847 --> 1:31:20.224
- these reds on the right.
- Excellent choice, if I may say so, sir.

1:31:20.309 --> 1:31:22.393
- That's the sale price.
- Oh, that's the sale price?

1:31:22.478 --> 1:31:26.773
- Yeah.
- I'm even thinking of replacing the old tree.

1:31:26.857 --> 1:31:30.485
And if I gave it to you for any cheaper,
I wouldn't be makin' any money.

1:31:30.569 --> 1:31:33.571
Let me tighten it. It has to—
You're letting it droop too much.

1:31:33.655 --> 1:31:36.407
I need a little more slack to get around—
How does this look?

1:31:36.492 --> 1:31:39.369
- Dad's side's perfect.
- You kiddin' me?

1:31:39.453 --> 1:31:41.454
- Yours needs work.
- Oh, yeah?

1:31:41.538 --> 1:31:42.538
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1:31:42.623 --> 1:31:44.248
What's that sound?

1:31:47.002 --> 1:31:49.003
- What's that?
- Turkey.

1:31:49.088 --> 1:31:51.464
- You're timing the turkey?
- Yep.

1:31:51.548 --> 1:31:53.549
That's so efficient.

1:31:54.134 --> 1:31:55.134
Jesus!

1:31:57.179 --> 1:31:58.846
Now you're— Oh-ho-ho.

1:31:58.931 --> 1:32:00.890
Oh-ho.

1:32:02.601 --> 1:32:05.686
- It's not cooked yet, Dad. I just checked it.
- You just checked it?

1:32:05.771 --> 1:32:07.313
Yeah, the juices are still red.

1:32:09.358 --> 1:32:13.486
Well, why don't you stick
to the potatoes and I'll do the turkey.

1:32:13.570 --> 1:32:14.946
Okay.

1:32:21.453 --> 1:32:25.790
Oh, this is you. Look, it has your name
and "The third grade" written on its butt.

1:32:27.668 --> 1:32:30.253
- Do you remember that?
- I remember when I made this.

1:32:30.337 --> 1:32:31.337
Yeah.

1:32:33.173 --> 1:32:34.674
- Hey, Dad, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:32:34.758 --> 1:32:36.676
Check that turkey, Grandpa.

1:32:41.849 --> 1:32:46.227
- Yeah, that's a big bird. You better cook it properly.
- Don't worry.

1:32:46.311 --> 1:32:49.313
- J ust check the leg, Dad, just to make sure.
- I will, I will.

1:32:49.398 --> 1:32:52.024
Mom would have cooked it for
at least another 30 minutes.

1:32:52.109 --> 1:32:55.111
Yeah. There's something I need to tell
all ofyou about your mother.

1:32:55.195 --> 1:32:57.738
As much as I loved her,
and as good a cook as she was...

1:32:57.823 --> 1:33:01.451
in all the 41 years we'd been married,
she always overcooked the turkey.

1:33:01.535 --> 1:33:06.080
Every single year.
I just never had the heart to tell her.

1:33:07.166 --> 1:33:10.460
All right. Perfect.

1:33:27.102 --> 1:33:29.103
There we go.

1:33:30.647 --> 1:33:32.732
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

1:33:32.816 --> 1:33:36.486
Perfect. Oh, yeah. Good boy.

1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:43.159
Okay, that's hot.

1:33:44.870 --> 1:33:47.538
Your family is making its way
in the world...

1:33:47.623 --> 1:33:51.042
and you can be proud of the children
and their achievements.

1:33:52.544 --> 1:33:55.796
And ifyou were to ask me,
I would have to say, in all honesty...

1:33:58.675 --> 1:34:00.676
everybody's fine.

1:34:02.930 --> 1:34:04.931
Everybody's fine.

1:34:20.822 --> 1:34:23.950
For so long

1:34:24.034 --> 1:34:27.119
I was out in the cold

1:34:27.204 --> 1:34:32.750
And I taught myself to believe
every story I told

1:34:34.336 --> 1:34:39.173
It was fun hanging on to the moon
headin' into the sun

1:34:40.259 --> 1:34:43.177
But it's been too long

1:34:43.262 --> 1:34:46.264
And now I wanna come home

1:34:49.268 --> 1:34:52.311
Came so close

1:34:52.396 --> 1:34:55.523
To the edge of defeat

1:34:55.607 --> 1:35:01.070
But I made my way in the shade
keepin' out of the heat

1:35:02.698 --> 1:35:07.618
It was fun shootin' out of the stars
lookin' into the sun

1:35:08.662 --> 1:35:11.706
But it's been too long

1:35:11.790 --> 1:35:14.625
And now I wanna come home

1:35:16.128 --> 1:35:22.091
Home, where there's nothing
but sweet surrender

1:35:23.218 --> 1:35:27.179
To the memories from afar

1:35:28.724 --> 1:35:34.645
Home, to the place
where the truth lies waiting

1:35:35.731 --> 1:35:40.818
We remember who we are

1:35:44.448 --> 1:35:47.575
For too long

1:35:47.659 --> 1:35:50.745
I was out on my own

1:35:50.829 --> 1:35:56.417
Every day I spent tryin' to prove
I could make it alone

1:35:58.003 --> 1:36:02.840
It was fun hanging on to the moon
headin' into the sun

1:36:03.884 --> 1:36:06.927
But it's been too long

1:36:07.012 --> 1:36:09.889
Now I wanna come home

1:36:24.029 --> 1:36:25.988
Home

1:36:45.926 --> 1:36:49.261
For so long

1:36:49.346 --> 1:36:51.847
I was out in the cold

1:36:53.225 --> 1:36:57.937
But I taught myself to believe
every story I told

1:36:59.523 --> 1:37:04.402
It was fun hanging on to the moon
headin' into the sun

1:37:05.487 --> 1:37:08.447
But it's been too long

1:37:08.532 --> 1:37:11.742
And now I wanna come home

1:37:11.827 --> 1:37:14.704
Yeah, it's been too long

1:37:14.788 --> 1:37:18.040
And now I wanna come home

1:37:18.125 --> 1:37:21.168
- Been too long
- Too long

1:37:21.253 --> 1:37:24.880
And now I wanna come home
