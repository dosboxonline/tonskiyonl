WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.972
The sinkholes
appeared with no warning

00:05.973 --> 00:07.907
- in every country in the world.
-Complete chaos

00:07.908 --> 00:10.143
at this hour on the streets of
every major city on the planet.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.744
They're exploding
from the ground.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.346
It seems like, with no warning,
they're exploding

00:13.347 --> 00:14.914
- from the ground.
-Scientists say

00:14.915 --> 00:16.483
the creatures that emerged
from the sinkholes

00:16.484 --> 00:18.518
may have been hibernating
for thousands of years.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.320
Their bullets
merely hinder the creatures

00:20.321 --> 00:21.954
but don't stop them.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.456
Many nations
have called in the military.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.325
...thousands dead,
no end in sight.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.993
People who live
at high altitudes are reporting

00:26.994 --> 00:28.861
that they've seen the Reapers
stop cold at 8,000 feet.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.797
This is Nederland, Colorado.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.532
Most of our town is destroyed,
but everything above 8,000 feet

00:32.533 --> 00:34.534
is completely untouched.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.803
Global lifeline
appears to be 8,000 feet.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.838
Authorities are
urging survivors

00:38.839 --> 00:40.873
to stay above that elevation.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.443
8,000 feet is
the global lifeline.

00:43.444 --> 00:47.248
If you can get to high ground,
go there now.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.711
MAN
Hey, Hunter.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.447
Everything okay?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.451
Hunter?

04:17.358 --> 04:21.361
I just... just wanted
to see other people.

04:21.362 --> 04:24.096
And you said most of the
monsters are sleeping again.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.199
You're on oxygen every night.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.804
What if your lungs seized up
when you were running away?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.975
I'm sorry, Dad.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.580
I can't lose you.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.782
I can't.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.052
I need you to understand that.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.453
-  This one's heavy.
- Yeah.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.955
Hold on.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.492
- You got it?
-  Yeah.

05:25.493 --> 05:28.461
Hey,
what happened this morning?

05:28.462 --> 05:31.230
He went across The Line
to get a better view

05:31.231 --> 05:32.932
of the Red Rock settlement.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.834
Well, he's the only kid
up here.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.603
He's lonely.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.439
He's alive.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.109
Some of us need more
than that, Will.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.977
I mean, we may be safe up here,

05:44.978 --> 05:48.281
but this mountaintop is
like a prison to him.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.485
He didn't just go there
to see Red Rock.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.424
WILL
The Line crosses

05:57.425 --> 05:59.226
Elba Fire Road near there.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.832
It's the last place
he saw his mother.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.790
MAN
Crow's Nest Refuge reports

07:37.791 --> 07:39.726
they sent a party of five
below The Line

07:39.727 --> 07:41.427
to forage for essentials.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.229
Nobody's come back so far,

07:43.230 --> 07:45.031
but they're still
holding out hope.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.133
They asked us to send somebody
out to the pinnacle

07:47.134 --> 07:49.101
to look for any signs
they're still out there.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.737
What road did they take?

07:50.738 --> 07:53.039
Sugarloaf Run
in the upper valley.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.047
WILL
I get it.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.618
You trust Nina.
But this is a suicide mission.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.686
It's not your job
to save the world.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.691
Okay, buddy.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.192
I'm here. I'm here.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.162
Take it easy.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.372
All right. Deep breaths.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.543
Nice and easy. Deep breaths.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.545
Deep breaths.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.480
Nice and easy.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.049
There you go.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.417
Nice and easy.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.289
Oh, I love you, man.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.553
So, the hay
keeps the potato warm

10:21.554 --> 10:23.289
as it grows out of the ground.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.391
When it gets cold,
you put the hay over it,

10:25.392 --> 10:29.528
keep the frost off the ground,
keep the potato warm.

10:29.529 --> 10:30.863
All right?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.598
Now, it's about timing,
all right?

10:32.599 --> 10:34.801
When you let it go...

10:34.802 --> 10:36.736
You have to let it go
at the right moment.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.137
Let go of the string.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.639
There you go.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.945
WILL
It's Hunter's birthday.

10:45.946 --> 10:49.381
Mm. And you want my last box
of mac and cheese?

10:49.382 --> 10:50.649
I have these to trade.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.585
It's not much, but...

10:54.855 --> 10:56.023
It's enough.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.991
HUNTER
No way!

10:58.992 --> 11:00.392
- How'd you get this?
-Come on.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.929
You know
I got connections, man.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.865
Happy birthday.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.135
Dad, why don't you use
the radio anymore?

11:09.136 --> 11:13.572
Oh. We have flags to signal the
other refuges if we need to.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.274
But it's not the same
as talking to them.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.009
It's hard enough
to make enough electricity

11:17.010 --> 11:18.310
for the things
we absolutely need,

11:18.311 --> 11:19.511
like your machine.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.913
Especially in the winter,

11:20.914 --> 11:22.215
with the days being so short.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.255
You're gonna leave, aren't you?

11:30.323 --> 11:31.924
That was your last filter.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.125
We need more.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.360
You get sick again...

11:34.361 --> 11:35.461
Then I won't get sick.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.397
No, it doesn't work like that.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.301
When?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.171
I'm going to be okay.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.314
I got 'em from Charlie.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.817
I'm pretty sure
he's trying to sleep with me.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.118
He's 80.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.053
Well,
after three years up here,

12:01.054 --> 12:02.923
I'm considering it.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.657
Where's Hunter?

12:05.658 --> 12:07.327
Sleeping.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.865
It's Friday night, you know.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.466
Is it?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.202
Mm-hmm.

12:16.203 --> 12:19.940
If this was before,
what would you be doing?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.810
I'd probably be at the 19th
hole with my father-in-law.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.647
I'm sorry, I never pictured you
as the country club type, Will.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.249
I wasn't.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.919
But Tara's family loved it.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.454
I hated it.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.925
And now I miss it.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.602
Goddamn it.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.286
We're out of filters, so
I'm-a have to give you a shot.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.478
Hello, Nina.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.147
How are you?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.985
How's the drinking?

13:38.986 --> 13:41.154
Keeps me from killing myself.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.992
How's yours?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.261
Keeps me from killing you.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.167
I'm leaving tomorrow.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.636
For Boulder.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.740
Well, that's probably the last
thing I expected you to say.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.676
I don't have a choice.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.215
You'll die.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.951
They can't be killed.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.685
You believed that,
you wouldn't still have

14:13.686 --> 14:15.722
this pirate flag on your wall.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.992
I found a safe way there.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.732
There is no safe way.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.002
I know every map.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.104
Every route. Two days' walk.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.407
Impossible to stay
above The Line the whole time.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.844
Hunter's machine.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.048
The last filter burnt out.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.516
The hospital in Boulder
will have a crate of 'em.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.553
But if I don't go, Hunter dies.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.961
The place was probably looted.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.362
No one had time to loot.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.464
You're gonna have to go
below The Line

14:58.465 --> 14:59.565
at least a dozen times.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.832
You can't survive a dozen

15:00.833 --> 15:01.833
encounters with those things.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.103
You survived.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.304
That was luck.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.839
Luck is not a strategy.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.475
Luck won't help you.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.210
You're the only person
who fought them and lived.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.844
You've studied them for years.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.680
- That'll help me.
- So what? "Do me a favor, Nina.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.415
Let's go. Let's die together."

15:16.416 --> 15:18.917
But last year, you thought
you found a way to kill them

15:18.918 --> 15:21.353
if you could get back
to your old lab.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.888
That's why Tara went with you.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.556
I have a way to Boulder.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.259
It's mapped out. We only go
below The Line twice.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.228
Twice?

15:29.229 --> 15:30.529
That's not possible.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.863
It is.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.065
Calway Mine.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.267
It goes through the mountain.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.602
A mine?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.936
A fucking mine, Will?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.339
That's your plan?

15:40.340 --> 15:41.840
That's a death trap
by definition.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.409
My company did a big job there.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.377
I walked every inch.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.447
I know those tunnels.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.251
You don't know anything.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.087
You're desperate.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.056
Desperate people get killed.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.224
8:00 a.m.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.426
Cathedral Point Overlook.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.094
Who says I'm going?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.363
Everything you've done up here
since day one says that.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.200
Shooting at that goddamn
Reaper scale every night.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.469
All you think about
is killing one of these things,

16:10.470 --> 16:13.272
and you need something
from down there to do it.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.107
You owe me this much.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.476
For Tara.

16:17.910 --> 16:18.911
Will.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.950
Boulder is 2,000 feet
below The Line.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.385
Even if you make it there,

16:26.386 --> 16:27.920
they'll be there waiting
for you.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.191
It only takes one of them.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.627
I know.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.297
TARA
Nina.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.132
Nina, it's getting closer.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.102
Nina!

17:16.103 --> 17:18.304
-It's coming this way!
-Stay to the right!

17:18.305 --> 17:20.439
I can't hold my breath
any longer.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.973
Shoot! Shoot!

17:23.810 --> 17:25.544
-No, please.
-We're going down!

17:25.545 --> 17:28.013
-Oh, God! Oh, God!
-Please.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.018
I-I can't...

17:48.067 --> 17:50.270
- Thanks.
-No problem.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.541
I have to go tomorrow.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.244
He's got four days,
five at the most.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.679
I'll stay here with him.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.521
Changed the zero to 200 yards,

18:09.522 --> 18:12.258
so you'll be able to engage 'em
from further out.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.593
Oh.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.362
AP rounds.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.364
These are from
my own personal stash.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.700
Slow 'em down a bit more
than a regular 556.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.402
Good luck out there.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.205
Thanks.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.941
Were you planning
on telling me?

18:29.976 --> 18:31.543
Huh?

18:31.544 --> 18:33.179
You just gonna run off
and get yourself killed

18:33.180 --> 18:35.215
without saying a word,
like Tara?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.719
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.787
Yeah, it was.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.888
- Hey, Tim?
-Yeah.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.190
My gear?

18:44.191 --> 18:45.757
Katie, what are you doing?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.593
-Going with you.
-No, you're not.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.295
Not asking permission, Will.
You can't go out there alone.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.062
You need a partner
to watch your back.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.631
Right. Nina's going with me.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.566
Oh, I'm definitely going now.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.101
The town needs you up here.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.703
And I need to see
what's down there.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.038
Why? What's the point?

19:00.039 --> 19:03.642
We're rats on a sinking ship,
and we need to find a way off.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.077
No, we don't.
We can survive up here forever.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.546
Everyone except Hunter.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.781
I don't want to live
like this forever, Will.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.483
And we both know
Hunter doesn't, either.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.984
Well, it's not his decision
to make.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.187
Not at eight years old.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.157
We're gonna have to fight them
eventually, Will.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.828
It might as well be today.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.073
We don't need your help.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.775
You don't need anyone's help,
do you, Nina?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.279
You ever seen one
coming for you?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.048
Up close.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.118
Not just a flickering light
in the distance.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.822
The way they tear people apart.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.024
Bullets bounce off them
like nothing.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.093
Unless you hit them
square in the face,

19:55.094 --> 19:57.063
and even then, it just gives
you a few seconds to run.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.502
We're gonna die out there.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.472
But you first.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.298
I won't be gone long.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.865
That's what Mom said.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.234
I'm coming back.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.338
Promise.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.043
WILL
We hit Alta Vista Ski Area,

20:45.044 --> 20:46.812
we might even use the ski lift.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.146
With what power?

20:48.147 --> 20:49.715
They have backup generators.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.016
Which won't work

20:51.017 --> 20:53.885
after sitting idle
for 992 days.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.222
If the batteries aren't
drained, I'll get it running.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.906
So, what's in Boulder, Nina?

21:14.907 --> 21:16.643
My old lab.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.546
I thought you were
a professor at Caltech.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.781
Researcher.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.452
Can't teach kids.
They're too stupid.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.556
Caltech students
are too dumb for you?

21:30.557 --> 21:32.825
So what's that make us, then?

21:34.761 --> 21:37.464
Not Caltech students, Katie.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.340
You could be nice.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.976
At least try.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.312
What's wrong
with not giving a shit?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.920
How do we know there isn't one

22:01.921 --> 22:04.390
hibernating down there?

22:04.391 --> 22:06.792
I'm not picking anything up.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.094
I guess that's not
a compass, is it?

22:09.095 --> 22:10.629
No.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.297
Did you find a way
to track 'em?

22:12.298 --> 22:14.166
Uh, bioelectromagnetism.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.267
They generate
their own magnetic fields.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.436
Stronger than ours.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.771
Stronger than any animal
on Earth.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.306
When they're within
a half mile,

22:21.307 --> 22:22.875
the needle is drawn to them.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.951
So, it's two miles
to the ski area?

22:32.952 --> 22:35.488
One mile if we cut
through the forest.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.537
Nina, you're the expert.

22:51.971 --> 22:55.674
Any idea why they don't go
above 8,000 feet?

22:55.675 --> 22:58.377
Mostly, I'm just hoping
they don't change their minds.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.114
Anything on that?

23:03.115 --> 23:05.985
Nothing yet.
It's quiet for now.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.357
Might be something
we could use.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.006
All right.
Still clear on the tracker.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.643
Needle moves, you say so.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.290
Got some ammo here.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.460
A few flares.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.606
Jackpot.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.945
- Huh?
- You know how to use that?

24:39.946 --> 24:41.880
It's designed
for an 18-year-old

24:41.881 --> 24:43.248
just out of basic training.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.650
I'm pretty sure
I can figure it out.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.285
No need.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.656
- So you've done this before?
- I'm from Texas, Will.

24:50.657 --> 24:51.957
Well, I'm from Louisiana.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.391
It doesn't mean
my dad taught me

24:53.392 --> 24:55.595
how to use a grenade launcher.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.639
Nina! How's it going?

25:10.710 --> 25:13.344
- Nina, can we please go?
- Will you two just shut up?

25:13.345 --> 25:14.846
I'm looking at a Reaper scale.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.688
If she wants to stay,
just let her.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.323
Just let her.
We don't need her anyway.

25:25.324 --> 25:28.994
Actually, you do. Unlike you,
I'm not dead weight.

25:28.995 --> 25:31.529
Um, fuck you, Nina.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.364
We both know who
you're trying to fuck, Katie,

25:33.365 --> 25:34.833
and it's not me.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.434
It's your best friend's
husband.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.136
You know what?

25:38.137 --> 25:40.005
Who you got killed.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.808
Do you remember that?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.475
Shit. Stop it.

25:45.511 --> 25:47.779
You bitch.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.684
I don't like you, Nina.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.353
I never have.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.492
I don't blame you, Katie.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.034
I'm fine. I'm fine.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.541
Where'd they all come from?

26:50.542 --> 26:52.611
Three years without us.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.749
Hold up. I need a minute.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.984
Top of the mountain's
8,000 feet.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.153
Ten, 15-minute hike,
we're safe.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.956
Or I can try to get
the chairlift working.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.658
We'd have to be
faster than that.

27:41.861 --> 27:42.962
They're here.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.335
Down there.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.636
Run!

27:51.637 --> 27:52.971
We'll never
make it to The Line.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.472
-We have to!
- It's too far!

27:54.473 --> 27:55.941
We have to try the lift.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.008
What if the battery's dead?

27:57.009 --> 27:58.144
She's right!

28:01.413 --> 28:03.049
- Cover me!
- Okay.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.538
Come on, Will.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.344
Come on, baby. Come on.

28:51.597 --> 28:54.399
Oh, shit. Come on.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.224
Fuck.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.297
Come on, come on.

29:48.087 --> 29:50.089
Hit the switch!

30:10.142 --> 30:12.311
Seventy-eight hundred feet.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.312
You have to jump!

30:51.183 --> 30:52.885
Come on, Katie!

30:54.186 --> 30:55.686
Go, go, go! Jump!

30:55.687 --> 30:56.822
Come on!

31:07.199 --> 31:08.333
Shit, I'm out.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.572
- Don't let go!
- I got you. I promise.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.143
We're almost there.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.615
Hang on!

31:24.616 --> 31:26.151
Eight thousand!

31:26.152 --> 31:30.356
We made it. We made it.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.041
Run! Run! Run!

31:55.982 --> 31:57.683
Come on, Katie!

32:19.738 --> 32:21.373
Y'all okay?

32:22.608 --> 32:24.443
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:40.059 --> 32:43.395
18-year-old, single malt.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.075
Those grenades did nothing.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.750
To one more night alive.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.530
It is different.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.601
Seeing them up close.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.306
We're not meant to share
the planet with those things.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.611
Maybe the Jesus freaks
were right.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.515
Maybe the Reapers are
judgment for mankind's sins.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.617
For eating God's apple,
then clear-cutting

33:39.618 --> 33:41.752
the Garden of Eden
with the knowledge it gave us.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.921
I don't buy that.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.857
So what do you buy?

33:47.526 --> 33:50.229
They're Earth's
new apex predators.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.964
And we're prey.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.972
So how do we
take our place back?

34:05.377 --> 34:08.180
They came out of nowhere,
all at once.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.449
No one's had a chance
to study them.

34:11.450 --> 34:12.850
You study something
long enough,

34:12.851 --> 34:14.285
you can figure out
how to kill it.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.222
If it doesn't kill you first.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.395
A lot more of us are gonna die.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.732
But one day,
we're gonna beat them.

34:31.403 --> 34:35.241
Three years, day and night,
researching them.

34:36.342 --> 34:37.743
Something had to stand out.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.513
What they did when they
first came out of the ground.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.082
Which was?

34:45.417 --> 34:48.586
Wipe out 95% of the world's
population in a month.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.589
They didn't stop
to eat or sleep.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.924
They just didn't stop.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.228
I don't follow.

34:57.263 --> 35:00.064
Predators kill to eat.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.866
The Reapers kill to kill.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.068
And they only killed us.

35:04.069 --> 35:06.837
It's like it's all they wanted,
was just to get rid of us.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.141
I don't think there's
some master plan, Nina.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.742
Simply what you said.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.711
They're predators
and we're prey.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.047
I didn't say that. Katie did.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.884
So what are you saying?

35:22.721 --> 35:24.990
Nothing. It's just a question.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.793
But I want an answer.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.833
TARA
What if Nina's right?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.436
What if she has found
a way to kill those things?

36:11.437 --> 36:13.103
WILL
I don't believe her.

36:13.104 --> 36:15.406
- Why not?
- She wants it too badly.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.642
- What does that mean?
- You know what I mean.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.644
If anyone could
figure it out, it's her.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.078
She's a physicist.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.647
Yeah, with a Messiah complex.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.649
Baby, that's all physicists.
They make a living

36:24.650 --> 36:26.451
unlocking God's secrets.

36:26.452 --> 36:29.254
I get it. You trust her.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.155
But this is a suicide mission.

36:31.156 --> 36:32.923
It's not your job
to save the world.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.394
- What is my job?
- To stay alive.

36:36.628 --> 36:39.196
You would have said something
different when we first met.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.367
That's before you almost died
in childbirth

36:42.368 --> 36:46.871
and we had a one-pound infant
clinging to life in the NICU.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.339
This is for Hunter.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.874
No, it's not.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.643
Not for Nina.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.312
This is about her wanting to be

36:54.313 --> 36:55.846
the first person
to kill a Reaper.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.114
And she'll die to do it.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.783
She's not suicidal, Will.

36:58.784 --> 37:02.320
She's after immortality.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.455
Why can't you see that?

37:04.456 --> 37:06.156
She doesn't have a family.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.860
She's never had a family.
She ca--

37:14.400 --> 37:17.569
It's just a matter of time
before he runs out of filters.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.738
That's a year from now,
at least.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.841
And the Reapers will
still be down there.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.744
So what's the difference?

37:27.879 --> 37:29.915
Another year together.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.352
That's the difference.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.084
When we come out,
it'll be close to dark.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.854
Can't hit the city at night.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.722
There's a ranger station
on the other side.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.692
We can stay there
until daybreak.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.394
What's the plan in there?

38:16.395 --> 38:17.928
This is level nine.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.597
The ladder will take us down
to level eight.

38:19.598 --> 38:22.533
We take eight
across the mountain, 2.2 miles.

38:22.534 --> 38:26.236
We exit at 8,023 feet,
on the other side,

38:26.237 --> 38:29.073
12 miles west of Boulder.

38:29.074 --> 38:32.109
Anything below level eight
is under The Line.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.578
We exit at 8,023 feet?

38:33.579 --> 38:34.846
That's right.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.115
How exact is that?

38:39.017 --> 38:41.386
Very.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.488
How do you know these tunnels
are perfectly straight?

38:43.489 --> 38:44.989
That they don't bow
somewhere in the middle?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.424
That would take us
below The Line.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.259
Or did you not think
about that?

38:51.997 --> 38:54.465
- Oh, you son of a bitch.
- Easy.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.602
We're going below The Line,
aren't we?

39:01.373 --> 39:03.208
- Will?
- For how long?

39:05.010 --> 39:07.077
231 yards.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.313
What?

39:09.314 --> 39:12.249
Both ends of the tunnel are
above 8,000 feet, so...

39:12.250 --> 39:15.786
So, nothing! These tunnels
are not hermetically sealed.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.287
How do you know
there aren't any fissures

39:17.288 --> 39:19.023
that lead to the lower levels
of the mine?

39:19.024 --> 39:21.091
You should have told us this
before we left the refuge.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.693
It's 231 yards.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.829
And besides,
your tracker will tell us

39:24.830 --> 39:26.330
if one of them is
within a half a mile.

39:26.331 --> 39:28.599
- No, it won't.
- It just did.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.100
Above ground.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.536
It's not gonna work
under a mile of rock.

39:31.537 --> 39:34.171
It's 45 seconds.
Why are you so worried?

39:34.172 --> 39:35.506
They come from
underground, Will.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.542
They're built for it.
We're not.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.343
They can see in the dark.

39:39.344 --> 39:41.546
They detect the smallest amount
of CO2, which we exhale

39:41.547 --> 39:43.347
and will build up
pretty fucking fast

39:43.348 --> 39:44.583
inside a fucking mine.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.252
Fuck.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.055
You swear a lot.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.458
Fuck you, Katie.

39:53.459 --> 39:55.894
- That's good.
-  Let's go.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.440
What's wrong?

41:16.474 --> 41:18.242
See my earlier comment
about the tracker

41:18.243 --> 41:20.278
not working
underneath a mountain.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.180
No.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.782
No.

41:57.783 --> 41:59.283
No, no, no, no, no.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.018
No! No!

42:05.023 --> 42:06.858
It's welded shut?

42:08.359 --> 42:09.995
What now?

42:14.165 --> 42:17.201
Climb down to level seven.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.969
That's below The Line, Will.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.339
- Yeah.
- For how long?

42:23.575 --> 42:25.042
About a thousand yards.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.277
A thousand yards?

42:27.278 --> 42:29.179
That's ten football fields.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.881
I mean,
how-how steep are these cliffs

42:30.882 --> 42:32.116
that we're trying to avoid?

42:32.117 --> 42:34.018
They're impassable.

42:34.019 --> 42:36.486
So either we climb down
or we go back.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.523
And I'm not going back.

43:02.380 --> 43:04.849
Either of you guys afraid
of heights?

43:04.850 --> 43:07.085
No, I'm afraid of monsters.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.732
So, what do we do
when we get to the bottom?

43:21.733 --> 43:23.668
- We just start sprinting?
- No, we can't sprint across.

43:23.669 --> 43:26.236
We'll just exhaust ourselves
and make too much noise.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.405
Worse than that--
we'll quadruple our CO2 output,

43:28.406 --> 43:30.775
which they can track
from a mile away.
That's what that light is

43:30.776 --> 43:31.777
at the end of
the tentacles.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.611
They track us
like giant mosquitoes.

43:34.145 --> 43:36.180
Great.

43:36.181 --> 43:38.216
So, slow and steady.

43:39.317 --> 43:42.386
- Are we ready?
- No.

43:42.387 --> 43:44.790
Just need a minute
to ponder my own death.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.427
You're funnier than I realized.

43:50.428 --> 43:51.862
Thanks.

43:51.863 --> 43:53.932
You're smarter than I realized.

43:57.502 --> 43:59.704
So, where were you
when they showed up?

44:03.008 --> 44:05.710
Well, the night
before the Reapers appeared...

44:07.412 --> 44:09.815
...my boyfriend and I
had gotten into an argument.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.918
And he took a swing at me
and broke my nose.

44:13.919 --> 44:15.219
- What?
- Yeah.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.486
What'd you do?

44:16.487 --> 44:18.155
I hit him with a frying pan

44:18.156 --> 44:20.424
and stole his car
and drove it to Nederland.

44:20.425 --> 44:22.059
That's fair.

44:22.060 --> 44:25.162
Anyway, next morning,

44:25.163 --> 44:26.897
I heard everything happening
over the radio,

44:26.898 --> 44:29.900
so I just went straight up
the fire road till the end

44:29.901 --> 44:32.002
and found the refuge.

44:32.003 --> 44:34.706
- Life's a bitch sometimes.
- Yep.

44:36.808 --> 44:38.776
And then giant murder bugs
hatch from the ground,

44:38.777 --> 44:41.578
and it's amazing how quick
nostalgia sets in.

44:41.579 --> 44:45.116
You should be
a motivational speaker.

44:46.785 --> 44:48.854
Can we get down this ladder, please?

45:28.726 --> 45:30.428
This way.

46:00.225 --> 46:02.093
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

46:03.461 --> 46:05.696
I think there's
something back there.

46:06.764 --> 46:07.932
I don't see anything.

46:07.933 --> 46:09.968
I heard something.

46:11.702 --> 46:13.771
- Or maybe I'm just being crazy.
- Wait.

46:14.940 --> 46:16.907
- Cover your light.
- What?

46:16.908 --> 46:18.776
Please do it.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.755
Is that...?

46:34.225 --> 46:36.193
Move!

46:46.938 --> 46:49.439
Duck!

47:07.225 --> 47:09.260
Go, go, go, go!

47:16.834 --> 47:18.969
Oh, shit.

47:18.970 --> 47:21.539
Will! Will! In here!

47:24.775 --> 47:25.910
It ends.

47:25.911 --> 47:27.144
Go, go, go!

47:27.145 --> 47:29.347
Will, it's a dead end. Shit.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.321
Over here! Come on!

47:37.322 --> 47:39.423
Turn off your headlamps.

47:39.424 --> 47:41.025
They can still track us
through the CO2.

47:41.026 --> 47:43.260
- So what do we do?
-  Don't breathe.

49:03.408 --> 49:05.742
- There's a way out!
- Go, go, go!

49:05.743 --> 49:07.645
Go, go, go, go, go!

49:11.382 --> 49:13.284
Hurry!

49:15.953 --> 49:18.422
Go!

49:22.460 --> 49:24.094
Will!

49:24.095 --> 49:26.930
Will, Will, Will, come on.

49:26.931 --> 49:28.232
Come on.

49:28.233 --> 49:30.934
- Come on!
- Come on, run!

49:30.935 --> 49:33.203
Katie, wait for us! Katie!

49:33.204 --> 49:35.240
There's an exit!

49:36.274 --> 49:38.142
Katie!

49:38.143 --> 49:39.777
Katie!

49:53.458 --> 49:54.791
Katie, no!

49:56.127 --> 49:57.262
Will!

50:03.501 --> 50:05.602
No.

50:11.442 --> 50:13.278
She's gone.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.147
She's gone.

50:17.948 --> 50:19.583
Oh, my God.

50:19.584 --> 50:21.918
It led right back into
the tunnel we came through.

50:24.189 --> 50:25.955
What was she thinking?

50:28.259 --> 50:29.626
It's coming back.

50:29.627 --> 50:31.695
What's that?

50:31.696 --> 50:33.331
What?

50:38.636 --> 50:40.638
Oh, my God. It's a ladder.

50:46.677 --> 50:48.212
Will, come on!

51:34.091 --> 51:36.026
Katie.

51:39.664 --> 51:42.432
You still believe in God?

51:42.433 --> 51:44.135
I'm stubborn.

51:46.571 --> 51:48.406
What'd you ask for?

51:51.576 --> 51:53.378
Revenge.

53:25.470 --> 53:28.037
Looks okay.
You think it'll start?

53:28.038 --> 53:30.540
If there's a fresh battery
inside.

53:30.541 --> 53:34.511
Tires are kind of ratty,
but it'll do.

54:24.762 --> 54:27.598
I must have made
a thousand boxes of this stuff.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.868
Every night,
Tara would ask Hunter

54:31.869 --> 54:35.204
what did he want for dinner,
and every night--

54:35.205 --> 54:36.741
mac and cheese.

54:37.808 --> 54:40.744
It's the casein,
the milk protein in cheese.

54:40.745 --> 54:43.147
It's like an opioid,
as addictive as morphine.

54:49.487 --> 54:51.155
Sorry.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.335
I really liked Tara.

55:07.838 --> 55:10.408
Seems like that was the
last person you liked, Nina.

55:15.079 --> 55:17.246
Katie grew on me.

55:17.247 --> 55:19.650
Guess I got her killed, too.

55:21.752 --> 55:24.954
I should have never
brought us in those mines.

55:24.955 --> 55:26.623
Would have been easier
scaling the mountain

55:26.624 --> 55:29.158
with no equipment.

55:29.159 --> 55:31.428
You want to make
her death matter?

55:31.429 --> 55:32.629
Don't feel guilt.

55:32.630 --> 55:34.665
Feel anger.

55:36.701 --> 55:39.168
I don't feel anything anymore.

55:39.169 --> 55:40.604
That's too bad.

55:40.605 --> 55:42.138
Anger's a terrible thing
to waste.

55:42.139 --> 55:44.140
You would know.

55:44.141 --> 55:46.444
So would you.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.416
I don't hate you, Nina.

55:52.417 --> 55:54.150
Yeah, you do.

55:54.151 --> 55:55.953
I would.

56:00.891 --> 56:02.660
What's in your old lab?

56:06.030 --> 56:08.432
Periclase.

56:08.433 --> 56:10.634
Cubic version
of magnesium oxide.

56:10.635 --> 56:12.236
Okay.

56:13.971 --> 56:16.506
The Reapers' scales--
they're impenetrable.

56:16.507 --> 56:18.875
I think it's because
they're electrically charged.

56:18.876 --> 56:20.877
A defense mechanism, I think.

56:20.878 --> 56:22.246
You think?

56:24.348 --> 56:27.116
If I'm right,
a projectile, a bullet,

56:27.117 --> 56:29.318
bonded with periclase,
it hits them,

56:29.319 --> 56:31.655
and theoretically,
it creates a momentary

56:31.656 --> 56:34.390
million-volt differential,
and boom.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.494
Uncontrollable
internal combustion.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.963
A magic bullet?

56:39.964 --> 56:42.165
That's what you've been
working on all this time?

56:42.166 --> 56:44.534
Literally a magic bullet?

56:44.535 --> 56:46.335
It's not magic. It's science.

56:46.336 --> 56:48.805
- It's a guess.
- It's a hypothesis.

56:48.806 --> 56:51.576
With a healthy dose
of wishful thinking.

56:55.946 --> 56:57.715
Tara believed me.

57:01.285 --> 57:03.921
Tara would believe anything
she thought could save Hunter.

57:05.456 --> 57:06.923
You knew that,

57:06.924 --> 57:09.093
talked her into going
and got them all killed.

57:10.561 --> 57:13.297
My wife, our friends.

57:14.799 --> 57:16.634
I told her not to go.

57:17.968 --> 57:20.638
I told her
listening to you was suicide.

57:25.976 --> 57:28.612
And yet, here you are.

57:28.613 --> 57:31.782
With me,
standing on that same ledge.

58:00.110 --> 58:01.746
Here we go.

59:18.155 --> 59:19.990
Jesus.

59:21.325 --> 59:22.893
Fifth floor.

59:36.506 --> 59:38.075
This way.

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:13.910
Don't look.

01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:15.813
I have to.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:43.572
Where are they?

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.308
There should be cases
of 'em in here.

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:50.213
- Was that...?
- Can't tell.

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:52.082
Nothing on the tracker.

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:55.985
Where else could they be?

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.987
Uh, the OR.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.491
That's one, no question.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.946
WILL
Here.

01:01:29.954 --> 01:01:32.688
- Come on, Will, we got to go.
- I know.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.793
Shit. It's close.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.395
I'm looking. I'm looking.

01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:42.932
I got 'em!

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:44.600
All right, come on.

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:46.636
Come on, come on, come on!

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:49.073
Okay.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.193
Come on.

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:16.866
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:02:42.026 --> 01:02:43.726
Holy fuck!

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.538
Go. Go.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.609
Here! In here.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.950
- Now we're trapped.
- No, we're not.

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:23.466
Stairs.

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:25.769
- What are you doing?
- I'm right behind you.

01:04:19.056 --> 01:04:20.856
I thought I told you to run.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.893
And I didn't listen.

01:04:29.133 --> 01:04:30.867
Is it dead?

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.004
It's not moving.

01:04:41.745 --> 01:04:43.146
Yeah, but...

01:04:43.147 --> 01:04:45.715
Right. We should
get the hell out of here.

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:48.217
The lab is close.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.219
- There's no time.
- I still need periclase.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.221
- The magnesium oxide.
- I have Hunter to think about.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:53.822
This is about more
than just your son.

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.391
There's no such thing
as more than my son.

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.160
How much time
did you just buy yourself?

01:04:57.161 --> 01:04:59.662
Six months? A year? Then you're
right back here again.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:01.664
Or we can prove
that they can be killed,

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:03.666
and when we fly that flag
over the refuge,

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:06.302
everyone else stuck on those
mountaintops will know it.

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:08.704
The whole world will come
and fight with us.

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:11.507
The odds may be stacked
against us, but I'm with Katie.

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.509
We can't live like this
forever.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.545
Sooner or later,
we have to fight them.

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:18.747
But I need your help.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.784
I can't do this alone.

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:26.022
Shit.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.457
Let's go.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.986
Scale.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:49.039
Nothing on the tracker.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.175
I'm gonna need five minutes.

01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:53.843
I'll keep watch.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.025
Thank God.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:47.564
I never knew you had a family.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.703
Well, I did.

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.705
You never said a word.

01:07:56.706 --> 01:07:58.508
No.

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:07.350
Let's let this dry,
see what happens.

01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:09.185
Gonna take a few minutes.

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:11.788
Figured you might want this.

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:37.981
I was here when it happened.

01:08:40.217 --> 01:08:42.251
It was a Saturday, but...

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:45.020
but my team was close
to a breakthrough,

01:08:45.021 --> 01:08:47.523
using cobalt to increase
the electron flow in batteries.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:49.326
Makes 'em
three times more efficient.

01:08:53.297 --> 01:08:56.300
That's what I was thinking
about when the world ended.

01:08:58.101 --> 01:08:59.836
Batteries.

01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:08.110
Billy, my seven-year-old,
had a soccer game that day.

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:09.912
You ever seen kids that age
play soccer?

01:09:09.913 --> 01:09:12.282
How they all just converge
on the ball at once?

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:21.758
The worst part is,
I chose not to go to that game.

01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:32.668
My husband had
been traveling for two weeks,

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.137
and he came back.

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:37.173
I was...

01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:43.213
I was tired of being a mom.

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:47.015
But there's nothing
you could have done.

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:50.053
I could have held him
in my arms one last time.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.667
I'm sure you've had
the same thought about Tara.

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:12.140
I never should have
encouraged her to come with me.

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.709
I was overconfident.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.778
I thought I'd figured out a way
to hold them off,

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:17.780
and I was wrong.

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:19.448
If it's any consolation,
I hate myself more

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:22.085
than you could possibly
hate me.

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:28.157
I only blame you because it's
easier than blaming myself.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.528
I knew she was going to go,

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:34.564
even after I tried to stop her.

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:38.200
And I let it happen.

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:39.635
You can't blame yourself.

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:41.671
Neither of us can.

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:44.908
What's the point?

01:10:51.415 --> 01:10:53.417
All right.

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:15.604
You tried, Nina.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:18.541
You did everything you could.

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:20.008
Go home, Will.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.445
Go save your son.

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:24.247
He's running out of time.

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:27.416
- What about you?
- I'm gonna stay.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.385
There are other things
I can try.

01:11:29.386 --> 01:11:31.520
Look, I'm not leaving you here.
We're in this together.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:33.088
And you got me here.

01:11:33.089 --> 01:11:34.723
But it didn't work,
and I'm not leaving

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:36.559
until it does
or until they kill me first.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.293
- Nina...
- Look,

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.195
my car is still
in the lot outside.

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:43.532
If I get this right, I won't
need your help to get back.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:46.234
I'll be on the road
right behind you.

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:49.572
If I don't...

01:11:49.573 --> 01:11:51.675
there's no point
in you dying here with me.

01:11:53.577 --> 01:11:55.479
Go.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:58.482
Go be with Hunter.

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:51.954
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:18.548
Shit.

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:31.454
Oh, shit.

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.099
Oh, shit.

01:17:42.859 --> 01:17:45.494
Son of a bitch.

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:06.515
They're machines.

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:10.652
They hunt us,
but they don't eat us.

01:18:10.653 --> 01:18:13.088
They don't sleep.
They don't breathe.

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:15.791
They don't go an inch
above 8,000 feet.

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:17.625
That's not a living creature.

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:19.896
That's programming.

01:18:20.964 --> 01:18:22.799
By who?

01:18:34.677 --> 01:18:36.579
Good shot.

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:39.215
Thanks.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:47.189
Why 8,000 feet?

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:49.025
I have no idea.

01:18:59.002 --> 01:19:01.003
Is your car still running?

01:19:01.004 --> 01:19:03.039
Radiator blew half a mile back.

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:07.309
God, it felt amazing
to kill those fuckers.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.845
Going to feel even better
when you raise that pirate flag

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:12.414
and tell the world
we have a way to beat 'em.

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:34.637
Dad!

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:40.442
Told you I was coming back.

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:42.311
I missed you so much.

01:19:52.655 --> 01:19:53.990
Come on.

01:20:15.979 --> 01:20:17.880
Oh, you see it? They did it!

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:27.322
MAN
Crow's Nest, this is Red Rock.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.790
Are you seeing
what we're seeing?

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:30.158
WOMAN
We have line of sight...

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.060
MAN 2
Yes. Confirmed.

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:33.595
- We have clear line of sight.
-Copy that. This is...

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:35.664
WILL
This is Lost Gulch Refuge.

01:20:38.201 --> 01:20:40.735
Three years ago,

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:43.472
the world we knew
disappeared overnight.

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:49.577
We lost our homes,

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:52.347
our communities

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:54.850
and most of the people
we loved.

01:20:59.455 --> 01:21:03.292
We still don't know why
above 8,000 feet we were safe.

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:08.564
But we don't have to play
by those rules anymore.

01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:16.572
The Reapers tried
to take our planet.

01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:22.078
They thought we'd die up here
in these mountains.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:34.590
Well, we're still here.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:22:00.616
Sooner or later,
we had to fight them.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.021
Might as well be today.
