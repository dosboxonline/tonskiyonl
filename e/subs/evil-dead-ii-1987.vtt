Well, it's a little rundown,

- Oh, yeah.

Ow!

02:45.708 --> 02:48.375

02:50.958 --> 02:52.292
I love it, Ash.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.625
I feel funny about being here.

who own this place come home?

03:07.125 --> 03:08.917
They're not gonna come back.

03:09.042 --> 03:11.917
Even if they do, we'll tell them
the car broke down or something.

03:12.042 --> 03:14.292
With your car, they'd believe it.

03:15.292 --> 03:19.417
Hey. What do you say we have
some champagne, eh, baby, huh?

03:19.542 --> 03:21.125
Sure.

03:21.208 --> 03:24.000
After all, I'm a man and you're a woman.

Thank you.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.250
- Annie!
- Hi!

14:42.375 --> 14:45.000
Mm. How did the expedition go?

14:45.125 --> 14:47.875
Great. I found the pages
of the "Book of the Dead".

14:48.000 --> 14:50.042
Yeah. I got your telegram, thanks.

14:50.167 --> 14:54.000
- So what condition are they in?
- Take a look.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.542
- They haven't aged a day in 3,000 years.
- Maybe longer.

14:58.917 --> 15:03.000
- When do we begin the translations?
- Tonight. All set with my father?

15:03.125 --> 15:05.667
It should be.
I haven't spoken with him in a week.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.833
There's no phone in the cabin.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.958
I'll take my car.
It'll take us an hour to get there.

15:13.208 --> 15:17.417
Annie, you hinted that your father was
on to something with his translations.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
What has he found
in the "Book of the Dead"?

15:19.625 --> 15:21.083
Probably nothing.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.333
But just possibly
the doorway to another world.

18:19.792 --> 18:21.458
Ah.

18:39.958 --> 18:41.333
Ah!

18:50.833 --> 18:52.750
Dance with me!

19:35.333 --> 19:37.167
Yeah, just...

19:41.375 --> 19:42.958
Ah, ah.

19:43.375 --> 19:44.917
Hello, lover.

Work shed.

Come on! No!

20:50.792 --> 20:55.583
Even now,
we have your darling Linda's soul.

20:55.708 --> 20:58.542
She suffers in torment.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.083
You're going down.

21:02.542 --> 21:04.500
Chainsaw.

21:54.583 --> 21:58.208
Please, Ash.
Please don't hurt me.

21:59.208 --> 22:02.500
You swore... you swore
that we'd always be together.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.000
I love you.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.167
No!

22:07.250 --> 22:10.667
Yes!
Your love was a lie.

22:10.792 --> 22:14.333
And now she burns in hell!

22:14.417 --> 22:17.375
Oh, yeah? All right. OK.

24:50.292 --> 24:51.625
I'm fine.

24:54.333 --> 24:55.958
I'm fine.

24:59.042 --> 25:01.000
I don't think so.

25:01.167 --> 25:05.375
We just cut up our girlfriend
with a chainsaw.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.792
Does that sound fine?

26:08.083 --> 26:10.292
You bastards!

26:12.375 --> 26:14.792
You dirty bastards!

26:23.625 --> 26:26.417
Give me back my hand.

26:28.750 --> 26:32.000
Give me back my hand!

26:50.458 --> 26:51.792
Mm-hm.

27:01.458 --> 27:02.958
Excuse me.

27:11.625 --> 27:12.958
Excuse me.

27:14.458 --> 27:17.125
Is this the road to the Knowby cabin?

27:17.250 --> 27:19.833
That's right. And you ain't going there.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.125
And why not?

27:33.417 --> 27:37.000
There must be another way in.
There's gotta be a road or something.

27:37.792 --> 27:39.833
Sure ain't no road.

27:44.417 --> 27:47.417
Why the hell do you wanna go
up there for, anyway?

27:50.375 --> 27:51.542
Huh?

27:53.375 --> 27:55.083
None of your business.

28:01.125 --> 28:05.625
Hey. I just remembered.
Why, yeah, that's right.

28:05.750 --> 28:10.375
There is a trail. Well, you could, uh...
follow Bobby Joe and me.

28:11.042 --> 28:12.625
Sounds all right to me.

28:12.708 --> 28:15.750
- But it'll cost you.
- How much?

28:16.917 --> 28:18.333
Forty-f...

28:20.458 --> 28:21.792
100 bucks.

28:22.708 --> 28:25.875
Tell you what,
you take my bags and you got a deal.

28:30.833 --> 28:32.333
Sure!

29:19.958 --> 29:22.167
No!

30:23.750 --> 30:27.667
That's right.
So who's laughing now?

30:36.250 --> 30:38.500
Who's laughing now?

31:25.958 --> 31:28.000
Jesus Christ!

31:28.125 --> 31:31.958
I thought she was talking
about them two goddamn little bags.

31:45.042 --> 31:46.917
Here's your new home.

33:25.708 --> 33:27.083
You son of a...

33:50.125 --> 33:52.917
Gotcha, didn't I, you little sucker?

34:26.208 --> 34:30.250
A double-barrel here.
I'll blow your butts to kingdom come!

34:32.458 --> 34:34.125
See if we don't.

34:43.875 --> 34:45.458
Huh?

35:29.375 --> 35:30.833
Oh!

37:22.625 --> 37:24.583
- Hit him!
- Ah!

37:24.667 --> 37:26.500
You little dirty bastard.

37:37.333 --> 37:41.708
- You gonna be all right, honey?
- I don't know. I think so.

37:41.833 --> 37:43.917
You just sit still for a minute.

37:46.083 --> 37:47.917
You know this son of a bitch?

37:48.042 --> 37:50.583
No. We thought our father
was gonna be here.

37:50.708 --> 37:53.250
Oh, my God. Where are my parents?

38:06.500 --> 38:08.542
What the hell did you do to them?

38:09.750 --> 38:12.042
What the hell did you do?

38:12.167 --> 38:14.000
Annie, come here! Annie!

38:14.667 --> 38:16.625
Come here! Come here.

38:21.542 --> 38:23.375
We'll throw him in there.

38:27.042 --> 38:29.083
Crazy buck's gone blood simple.

38:29.167 --> 38:30.583
'BIZ

38:31.167 --> 38:33.667
I... I made a mistake.

38:39.875 --> 38:42.458
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Bring him over here.

38:42.542 --> 38:43.875
No! I made a mistake.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.250
Damn right,
you black-mouth son of a bitch!

38:56.250 --> 38:58.583
I hope you rot down there!

39:06.667 --> 39:09.667
- Oh, shit!
- I know it hurts, baby.

39:09.792 --> 39:11.792
But everything's gonna be fine.

39:11.917 --> 39:15.583
In about five minutes, I'm gonna go
fetch the sheriff and bring him...

39:16.917 --> 39:18.292
I checked all the rooms.

39:19.083 --> 39:21.500
Your folks aren't here.
Maybe they never came.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.083
But these are my father's things.

- Move it!

Help me, please!

Help me!

41:41.167 --> 41:42.542
Do something!

42:52.083 --> 42:53.625
There's something out there.

42:55.583 --> 42:56.917
That...

42:58.250 --> 43:00.583
That witch in the cellar
is only part of it.

43:04.125 --> 43:05.458
It lives...

43:06.750 --> 43:08.208
...out in those woods.

43:10.167 --> 43:11.500
In the dark.

43:13.167 --> 43:14.500
Something...

43:16.792 --> 43:20.000
Something that's come back
from the dead.

43:20.667 --> 43:23.167
Jake!
Please, let's get the hell out of here!

43:23.292 --> 43:26.083
- We're going, baby.
- Nobody goes out of that door!

43:26.208 --> 43:28.000
- Not till daylight!
- Listen to me.

43:55.250 --> 43:56.917
Remember that song, Annie?

43:57.958 --> 44:01.208
I used to sing it to you
when you were a baby.

44:02.042 --> 44:03.833
Mother?

44:03.917 --> 44:06.333
Unlock these chains. Quickly.

44:15.042 --> 44:16.542
No.

44:16.625 --> 44:21.708
You were born September 2nd, 1962.

44:21.833 --> 44:25.250
I remember it well
because it was snowing.

44:26.583 --> 44:30.542
So strange it would be snowing
in September.

44:32.333 --> 44:35.292
That thing in the cellar is not my mother!

44:44.833 --> 44:48.458
We are the things that were
and shall be again.

44:51.333 --> 44:56.208
Spirits of the Book.
We want what is yours. Life.

44:58.042 --> 45:01.292
- Dead by dawn.
- Dead by dawn.

45:01.375 --> 45:03.250
Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn!

45:03.333 --> 45:06.042
Dead by dawn.

45:20.542 --> 45:23.625
- Let me out!
- You son of a bitch.

45:31.750 --> 45:33.083
No!

45:34.333 --> 45:38.250
Where are you going?
Help us, you fucking coward!

45:40.500 --> 45:42.375
Quickly! Set me free.

46:00.958 --> 46:04.625
We live! We live still!

46:42.917 --> 46:44.417
That's funny.

46:45.542 --> 46:46.875
What?

46:48.417 --> 46:50.333
That trail we came in here on?

46:52.042 --> 46:54.167
Well, it just ain't there no more.

46:56.208 --> 46:57.542
Like...

46:59.708 --> 47:01.917
Like the witches swallowed her up.

47:25.667 --> 47:27.250
It's so quiet.

48:13.917 --> 48:16.125
What the hell was that?

48:16.250 --> 48:20.292
Maybe something trying
to force its way into our world.

48:49.625 --> 48:51.250
It's in there.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.458
We'll all go in together.

48:56.583 --> 48:59.833
Hell, no!
You're the curious one.

49:20.417 --> 49:21.750
Hey-

49:24.833 --> 49:26.458
I'll go with you.

50:20.833 --> 50:22.458
Shit.

50:22.583 --> 50:25.125
I told you there weren't
nothing in here, no how.

50:50.917 --> 50:53.083
Holy mother of mercy.

50:53.958 --> 50:57.000
- Father?
- Annie?

50:57.125 --> 51:02.292
There is a... dark spirit here

51:02.375 --> 51:04.375
that wants to destroy you.

51:04.500 --> 51:08.000
Your salvation lies there.

51:15.625 --> 51:17.625
In the pages of the Book.

51:19.750 --> 51:23.792
Recite the passages.
Dispel the evil.

51:25.250 --> 51:27.417
Save my soul.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.458
And your own lives!

51:42.542 --> 51:45.625
Jake... you're holding my hand too tight.

51:47.917 --> 51:49.958
Baby, I ain't holding your hand.

52:08.875 --> 52:10.208
Hey...

52:11.500 --> 52:13.125
Where's Bobby Joe?

53:00.417 --> 53:02.000
Stop!

54:05.167 --> 54:08.875
Hey. Where the hell is she?

54:21.792 --> 54:24.375
We gotta go out there and find her.

54:24.500 --> 54:27.792
If she went out in those woods,
you can forget about her.

54:32.958 --> 54:34.833
What's wrong?

54:37.000 --> 54:39.667
It felt like someone
just walked over my grave.

54:43.542 --> 54:47.042
What's that picture? What is that?

54:48.375 --> 54:49.708
In 1300 AD,

54:49.833 --> 54:54.167
they called this man
the Hero from the Sky.

54:54.917 --> 54:57.708
He was prophesied
to have destroyed the evil.

54:59.333 --> 55:01.333
He didn't do a very good job.

55:02.792 --> 55:04.500
Can you find it?

55:06.042 --> 55:09.000
Here it is. Two passages.

55:14.042 --> 55:16.208
"Recitation of this first passage...

55:18.333 --> 55:23.292
"...will make this dark spirit
manifest itself in the flesh."

55:25.875 --> 55:27.708
Why the hell would we wanna do that?

55:27.792 --> 55:30.333
"Recitation of the second passage

55:30.417 --> 55:34.708
"creates a kind of...
rift in time and space.

55:35.625 --> 55:37.917
"And the physical manifestation
of this dark spirit

55:38.042 --> 55:40.042
"can be forced back into the rift."

55:40.875 --> 55:43.375
That's the best translation I can...

55:44.917 --> 55:48.000
Uh-huh. That's right.

55:49.292 --> 55:51.208
I'm running the show now.

55:51.917 --> 55:55.042
We're gonna go up there in them woods
and look for Bobby Joe.

55:55.167 --> 55:57.250
Once we find her,
we're getting the hell out of here!

55:57.333 --> 55:58.667
No, you idiot!

56:00.167 --> 56:01.792
It Will kill us all.

56:03.125 --> 56:07.000
She's dead by now.
Don't you understand?

56:07.083 --> 56:11.167
With these pages,
at least we have a chance.

56:15.250 --> 56:17.417
Bunch of mumbo-jumbo bullshit!

56:19.708 --> 56:21.750
These pages don't mean squat!

56:28.750 --> 56:31.708
Besides, now you ain't got no choice.

56:33.500 --> 56:34.833
Now move!

56:45.083 --> 56:46.958
- Move.
- You're nuts.

56:47.083 --> 56:50.917
- I said move!
- Oh, you stupid fool!

56:57.500 --> 56:59.500
I'll blow your fucking head off!

57:43.667 --> 57:45.000
Hey-

57:46.833 --> 57:48.208
No trail.

57:49.125 --> 57:50.833
Where to now?

57:50.958 --> 57:52.375
Uh, uh...

57:55.458 --> 57:56.917
Bobby Joe!

58:05.292 --> 58:06.667
Bobby Joe!

58:14.167 --> 58:15.542
Bobby Joe!

58:15.667 --> 58:17.542
You'll get us all killed!

58:18.750 --> 58:21.250
- Leave him alone!
- Get outta here!

58:23.583 --> 58:25.750
Bobby Joe!

58:29.292 --> 58:32.583
Bobby... Joe!

58:35.333 --> 58:38.458
Bobby Joe... where are you, girl?

59:09.417 --> 59:11.250
You're nuts!

59:21.333 --> 59:23.292
Annie!

01:00:57.917 --> 01:00:59.250
No.

01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:02.542
No.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:06.625
Aargh! No, no!

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:01.875
I'm sorry.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.708
Get me in the other room.

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:06.625
Get the axe.
We'll kill him when he comes back.

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:09.708
But first, pull this damn thing out of me!

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.625
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.083
Hurry! Hurry!

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:30.167
L'm trying. I'm trying!

01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:42.083
Shut up!

01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:44.458
Shut up! Shut up!

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:12.667
Check out... beside the windows.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.917
Check the windows. He's probably...

01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:21.167
Help me!

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:52.333
Oh, God!

01:05:27.917 --> 01:05:29.708
No, no! Wait!

01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:33.958
Listen to me!

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.750
I'm all right now.

01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:38.583
That thing is gone.

01:05:51.708 --> 01:05:54.458
Damn it! I said I was all right!

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:57.833
Are you listening to me?
Do you hear what I'm saying?

01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:00.417
I'm all right!

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:08.083
I'm all right.

01:06:09.458 --> 01:06:12.042
OK, maybe you are.

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:15.375
But for how long?

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:22.208
If we're gonna beat this thing,
we need those pages.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.875
Then let's head down into that cellar
and carve ourselves a witch.

01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:21.292
Groovy.

01:08:05.125 --> 01:08:06.958
Those pages are down there somewhere.

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:47.875
The pages. Quick!

01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:15.125
Nos Feratos, Kalamimnon, Kanda!

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:53.667
No!

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:13.042
Let's go.

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:46.625
Swallow your soul. I'll swallow your soul.

01:13:39.167 --> 01:13:40.875
Hey, I'll swallow your soul!

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:44.208
I'll swallow your soul!
I'll swallow your...

01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:46.458
Swallow this.

01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.625
I only completed
the first of the passages.

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:23.875
That was to make the evil
a thing of the flesh.

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.542
You didn't finish it?

01:15:33.875 --> 01:15:37.000
There's still the second passage.
The one...

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.958
The one to open the rift
and send the evil back.

01:15:44.083 --> 01:15:47.000
Well, start reciting it! Now!

01:15:58.542 --> 01:16:00.958
Don't look, Annie! Finish the passages!

01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:03.042
Get rid of it!

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:06.333
Kanda! Amantos! Kanda!

01:16:07.792 --> 01:16:12.333
<i>Kanda'. Somonda Reba Neda Gyes'.!</i>

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:13.792
Enzeen!

01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:26.292
No!

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:49.042
Nos Feratos!

01:16:49.667 --> 01:16:51.167
Amenal!

01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:52.708
Akadiv!

01:17:01.958 --> 01:17:03.583
ldres.

01:17:17.958 --> 01:17:19.833
'We've won!'
'We've won!'

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.625
Victory is ours!

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.333
Kanda.

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:58.833
You did it, kid.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:02.500
By God...

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:37.333
For God's sake!
How do you stop it?

01:19:47.375 --> 01:19:49.708
Slay the beast! 'Tis a deadite!

01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:53.208
- Huh?

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:59.000
Run! Run for the castle!

01:20:36.375 --> 01:20:38.625
Hail he who has come from the skies

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:42.000
to deliver us
from the terrors of the deadites!

01:20:42.125 --> 01:20:43.750
Hail!

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:45.375
Hail!

01:20:45.458 --> 01:20:46.792
Hail!

01:20:46.917 --> 01:20:48.250
No...

01:20:48.375 --> 01:20:51.167
- Hail! Hail!
- No!

01:20:52.417 --> 01:20:55.792
- No!
- Hail! Hail!

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.250
No!

01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:59.417
Hail! Hail!

01:20:59.542 --> 01:21:02.542
NO! No!

01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:05.792
Hail! Hail!

01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:07.250
No!
