WEBVTT

02:12.625 --> 02:16.250
We buy mattresses

02:16.333 --> 02:18.000
Bedsprings

02:18.083 --> 02:20.291
Refrigerators

02:20.375 --> 02:22.416
Stoves

02:22.500 --> 02:24.625
Washing machines

02:24.708 --> 02:26.666
Microwaves

02:26.750 --> 02:28.875
We buy…

03:08.541 --> 03:10.708
COUNSELOR-AT-LAW

03:37.500 --> 03:39.250
-Hello?
-Making progress?

03:39.333 --> 03:40.583
Almost done.

03:40.666 --> 03:42.958
The building super won't testify.

03:43.041 --> 03:46.458
-What?
-The building super won't testify.

03:46.541 --> 03:48.458
Will the jury buy this?

03:48.541 --> 03:51.333
That's my problem, I'll deal with it.

03:51.416 --> 03:53.750
We'll make the case for suicide.

03:53.833 --> 03:54.916
Suicide.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.166
You got it.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.250
Sure, sir.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.791
-I'm counting on you.
-I'm on it.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.708
Goodnight.

04:07.916 --> 04:10.791
This prick kills his wife

04:10.875 --> 04:12.666
and we call it suicide.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.625
CASE: GABRIEL MENDOZA
OPENING ARGUMENT

04:14.708 --> 04:16.458
A routine case?

04:20.375 --> 04:21.958
Mr. Magistrate,

04:22.833 --> 04:24.291
your Honor,

04:26.291 --> 04:30.125
honorable lawyers
for the family of the deceased,

04:31.375 --> 04:33.875
honorable colleagues for the plaintiff,

04:35.041 --> 04:38.708
esteemed members of the jury, etc.

04:38.791 --> 04:42.000
I agree with my colleagues
from the prosecution.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.875
This case is far too…

04:44.958 --> 04:46.416
commonplace.

04:47.791 --> 04:49.750
It's a case about violence.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.375
Thanks.

04:58.458 --> 05:01.041
What are we talking about today?

05:02.333 --> 05:04.166
We're talking about a couple

05:04.958 --> 05:08.083
The couple formed
By my client and his wife

05:08.958 --> 05:10.750
Whom he is accused of murdering

05:16.416 --> 05:19.833
Rising and falling

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
What are we talking about today?

05:29.791 --> 05:31.875
About violence

05:33.375 --> 05:34.958
About love, death

05:36.458 --> 05:38.916
About a suffering country

05:39.875 --> 05:42.166
What are we talking about today?

05:43.625 --> 05:45.625
We're talking about a couple

05:46.500 --> 05:49.833
The couple formed
By my client and his wife

05:49.916 --> 05:52.791
Whom he couldn't save from suicide

05:52.875 --> 05:55.791
A prosperous couple, envied

05:55.875 --> 05:57.833
But a generous couple too

05:58.416 --> 06:01.875
Who in Mexico City didn't love them?

06:01.958 --> 06:04.208
This is not a fairy tale

06:05.333 --> 06:07.791
This is a love story

06:07.875 --> 06:09.166
Back to the facts

06:10.375 --> 06:12.416
What are we talking about today?

06:13.833 --> 06:15.875
About justice for sale?

06:16.583 --> 06:18.791
Corrupted verdicts sold by tabloids

06:18.875 --> 06:21.625
Beheaded on the right
Bimbos on the left

06:21.708 --> 06:23.916
Rumors gushing in the streets

06:30.875 --> 06:31.958
More coffee?

06:32.958 --> 06:34.000
Please.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.791
Come and open the doors

06:42.541 --> 06:44.958
To the Courtroom of your Conscience

06:45.666 --> 06:48.125
Listen! Answer my question!

06:48.791 --> 06:54.250
Could you grant my client
Mr. Gabriel Mendoza

06:54.958 --> 06:59.125
The right to love his wife?

07:01.458 --> 07:02.916
Your Honor

07:04.416 --> 07:06.625
I call for the triumph of love

07:08.000 --> 07:09.583
Innocence

07:10.791 --> 07:13.000
The defeat of bad faith

07:17.416 --> 07:20.916
When we speak of violence

07:21.000 --> 07:24.333
Let's speak of compassion

07:24.416 --> 07:26.250
Let's speak of our dead

07:26.333 --> 07:28.000
Let's speak of our shadows

07:28.083 --> 07:29.666
Let's greet our world

07:31.375 --> 07:34.500
When we speak of violence

07:34.583 --> 07:36.958
Let's open our hearts

07:37.666 --> 07:40.791
Let's love women, let's forgive men

07:40.875 --> 07:43.750
Let's embrace Misery

07:44.916 --> 07:49.625
Misery…

07:57.750 --> 08:00.291
A big-hearted man, now a victim

08:00.375 --> 08:04.416
of the media
that repeatedly slandered him.

08:05.375 --> 08:06.416
Excuse me?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.250
You'll be late.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.125
You're right, shit!

08:27.958 --> 08:29.625
Gabriel Mendoza

08:29.708 --> 08:31.500
did not kill his wife!

08:31.583 --> 08:33.291
She took her own life!

08:33.875 --> 08:35.791
This is a trial by the media

08:37.125 --> 08:38.875
that repeatedly slander him!

08:39.750 --> 08:42.916
They subjected my client and his wife
to public scrutiny.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.125
We are right to blame him

08:47.291 --> 08:50.208
and to condemn the harm he's done.

08:51.958 --> 08:53.750
Today, I wish…

08:53.833 --> 08:54.750
Well…

08:55.416 --> 08:57.625
That idiot forgets everything.

08:58.958 --> 09:01.541
I wish to appeal

09:01.625 --> 09:04.000
to your consciences,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:04.083 --> 09:07.083
I wish to appeal to your consciences,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.875
Do you think my client…

09:10.833 --> 09:13.708
He looks like such a criminal.

09:13.791 --> 09:16.375
…against any woman? Against any person?

09:16.458 --> 09:18.250
I have refuted not one,

09:19.458 --> 09:21.916
but all the prosecution's arguments.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.208
I demand the release of my client…

09:25.875 --> 09:27.291
Mr. Gabriel Mendoza.

09:28.416 --> 09:29.500
Thank you.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.083
What bullshit!

09:39.666 --> 09:43.875
My client and I never doubted
our country's judicial system.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.083
Hello, Mom?

09:46.375 --> 09:47.958
Yes, we won.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.291
We won!

09:50.458 --> 09:52.375
Yes, I'm glad.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.708
But I feel like I ate shit.

09:54.791 --> 09:55.916
I said…

09:56.000 --> 09:57.583
No, forget it.

09:57.666 --> 09:59.083
Sunday?

10:02.333 --> 10:04.541
No, I have tons of work.

10:04.625 --> 10:06.125
I'll call you back, Mom.

10:06.208 --> 10:07.666
Wish me luck.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.333
Excuse me.

10:12.416 --> 10:14.458
-Got a tampon?
-Yes.

10:14.541 --> 10:15.958
I'm out of whack.

10:16.041 --> 10:18.583
-Don't worry.
-Thanks.

10:21.791 --> 10:24.416
This is a case that really stands out.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.333
Fuck.

10:46.208 --> 10:47.958
Mom, can I call you back?

10:48.666 --> 10:51.083
Ms. Rita Mora Castro?

10:51.666 --> 10:53.208
Yes? What?

10:54.250 --> 10:56.875
Why are you in the bathroom?

10:56.958 --> 11:00.375
You're the one deserving of applause,
Counselor.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.333
Who is this?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.500
Do you want to become rich?

11:10.583 --> 11:12.791
I have a proposition for you.

11:12.875 --> 11:15.791
Be at the newsstand in 10 minutes.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.750
Excuse me, but I don't know who…

11:18.416 --> 11:19.541
Hello?

11:31.916 --> 11:33.458
After all…

11:36.125 --> 11:38.583
How much longer

11:38.666 --> 11:41.250
Will I hang my head?

11:41.333 --> 11:44.208
How much longer

11:44.291 --> 11:46.500
Will I lick their boots?

11:46.583 --> 11:49.250
How much longer

11:49.958 --> 11:52.208
Will I waste my talent on them?

11:52.291 --> 11:54.583
How much longer

11:54.666 --> 11:57.666
Will I toil away for nothing?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.416
What have you to gain?

12:00.125 --> 12:01.916
What have I to gain?

12:02.625 --> 12:05.291
What have you got to lose?

12:05.375 --> 12:07.125
What have I got to lose?

12:07.875 --> 12:10.375
Me and my fucking law degree

12:10.458 --> 12:13.166
Extra, extra, extra large

12:13.250 --> 12:15.583
Me and my fucking salary

12:15.666 --> 12:18.541
Extra, extra, extra small

12:18.625 --> 12:21.083
Me and my stone-cold heart

12:21.166 --> 12:23.375
Extra, extra, extra hard

12:23.458 --> 12:26.208
Me and my fat ass

12:26.291 --> 12:29.291
Extra, extra, extra

12:29.375 --> 12:32.000
How much longer?

12:32.083 --> 12:34.500
What have we got to gain?

12:34.583 --> 12:37.208
How much longer?

12:37.291 --> 12:39.541
What have we got to lose?

12:39.625 --> 12:42.625
And my so-called friends tell me

12:42.708 --> 12:45.333
"What about marriage?
What about kids?"

12:45.416 --> 12:47.875
I have no time to make babies

12:47.958 --> 12:50.791
And bitches at work tell me

12:50.875 --> 12:53.125
"When will you open your own firm?"

12:53.208 --> 12:55.708
Who knows?
When I won't be Black

12:55.791 --> 12:58.333
Why did he call?
Why me?

12:58.416 --> 13:01.000
Why at the newsstand?

13:01.083 --> 13:03.666
Why did he call?
Why me?

13:03.750 --> 13:06.333
Why at the newsstand?

13:06.416 --> 13:09.000
I have nothing to lose

13:09.083 --> 13:11.458
You have nothing to lose

13:11.541 --> 13:14.541
I have everything to gain

13:14.625 --> 13:17.000
You have everything to gain

13:38.875 --> 13:39.875
Ma'am?

14:49.875 --> 14:52.333
Everyone, into the pickup!
Time to go!

15:13.333 --> 15:14.666
Is anyone here?

15:18.041 --> 15:18.958
Are you afraid?

15:23.083 --> 15:24.083
Should I be?

15:25.958 --> 15:26.958
No.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.458
Do you know who I am?

15:38.208 --> 15:39.375
No.

15:40.708 --> 15:42.875
Manitas Del Monte.

15:42.958 --> 15:44.916
Pleased to meet you.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.291
Shit.

15:51.291 --> 15:55.291
What do you know of my situation,
Counselor Mora Castro?

15:56.375 --> 15:58.000
Your situation?

16:05.833 --> 16:07.583
Your business is thriving.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.291
Your cartel

16:09.875 --> 16:12.250
wiped out the Alianza del Norte,

16:13.333 --> 16:16.291
your competitor
in the synthetic drug trade.

16:17.666 --> 16:20.083
You made new political allies
last year,

16:21.333 --> 16:22.875
and the elections…

16:23.458 --> 16:25.416
the elections proved you right.

16:27.875 --> 16:28.875
Bingo!

16:39.541 --> 16:41.916
How can I help you, Mr. Del Monte?

16:44.750 --> 16:47.458
Answering that question would mean

16:47.541 --> 16:48.666
You've accepted

16:48.750 --> 16:50.583
The mission and its secret

16:50.666 --> 16:53.041
Once I tell you what it is

16:53.125 --> 16:54.541
There's no turning back

16:54.625 --> 16:56.416
Hearing is accepting

16:56.500 --> 16:57.750
Also you must know

16:57.833 --> 16:59.375
If I tell you what it's about

16:59.458 --> 17:00.791
And if you agree

17:00.875 --> 17:03.375
Considerable sums of money

17:03.458 --> 17:05.458
Will be wired to Switzerland

17:05.541 --> 17:07.375
The Caymans and elsewhere

17:07.458 --> 17:09.208
Accounts of which only you and I

17:09.291 --> 17:10.875
Will know the existence

17:10.958 --> 17:12.375
Numbers and codes

17:12.458 --> 17:14.333
Accounts and millions

17:15.833 --> 17:17.708
Only you

17:17.791 --> 17:19.416
And me

17:28.916 --> 17:30.291
What do I risk?

17:31.666 --> 17:33.375
Becoming rich.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.375
All right.

17:52.958 --> 17:54.250
All right what?

17:56.458 --> 17:58.000
What do you want me to do?

18:06.583 --> 18:08.500
I want to be a woman.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.750
I don't get it.

18:16.833 --> 18:18.166
What don't you get?

18:19.708 --> 18:20.833
Well, like…

18:21.500 --> 18:23.416
you mean physically a woman?

18:24.625 --> 18:25.708
Yes.

18:25.791 --> 18:27.458
Do you want…

18:28.625 --> 18:32.208
to change your life
or to change your sex?

18:34.625 --> 18:36.375
What's the difference?

18:39.625 --> 18:40.708
Well…

18:41.333 --> 18:43.250
I'm a lawyer, Mr. Del Monte.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.166
I'm not a surgeon.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.166
That's why I hired you.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.000
To find a good one.

18:50.666 --> 18:53.000
Mr. Del Monte, it could take…

18:55.000 --> 18:57.583
years, it's not at the snap of a finger.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.416
I started treatment two years ago.

19:05.250 --> 19:08.000
There's no backtracking, kid.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.833
Not for you, not for me.

19:12.166 --> 19:15.083
Find me a safe place for the "reset."

19:15.166 --> 19:16.333
Far away,

19:16.416 --> 19:18.833
not here, not in the United States.

19:18.916 --> 19:21.875
A place where no one could ever find me.

19:21.958 --> 19:25.291
Get me someone untraceable.

19:25.375 --> 19:28.125
Someone competent, spotless.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.875
Your predecessor
wasted a lot of my time.

19:30.958 --> 19:36.458
Counselor Mora Castro,
you now dispose of all my resources.

19:36.541 --> 19:38.208
And, as you can see,

19:38.291 --> 19:39.750
they are unlimited.

19:40.416 --> 19:42.333
Mexico-Bangkok,

19:42.416 --> 19:44.125
then Bangkok-Bombay, Bombay-Rio.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.125
I have a Mexico City-Haneda.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.500
4-hour layover, Haneda-Bangkok.

19:48.583 --> 19:51.291
-How long would it be?
-26 hours.

19:52.458 --> 19:56.458
I have to be back Thursday
for a court hearing.

19:56.541 --> 19:58.375
You won't make it.

19:58.916 --> 20:00.208
Find me something else.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.041
Like what, a rocket?

20:02.708 --> 20:03.833
Another class.

20:03.916 --> 20:05.083
Business?

20:05.166 --> 20:07.041
It's much more expensive.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.791
-And above that?
-Above what?

20:10.583 --> 20:11.708
Business.

20:11.791 --> 20:15.208
Wait, you really want me
to check First class?

20:16.625 --> 20:17.625
Yes.

20:17.708 --> 20:20.500
It exceeds the rates we agreed to.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.875
-How will you pay?
-Credit card.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.125
What kind of card?

20:26.125 --> 20:27.333
Rita?

23:35.375 --> 23:36.500
Listen, bitch.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.333
Where are you at, Mora Castro?

23:40.250 --> 23:43.750
Think I pay you
to act like hot shit in First class?

23:45.375 --> 23:47.083
Move faster, goddammit.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.791
I'm running out of time.

28:20.833 --> 28:21.791
Manitas Del Monte.

28:21.875 --> 28:23.208
Dr. Wasserman.

29:42.833 --> 29:44.750
I can't cope anymore.

29:46.916 --> 29:50.083
I constantly thought
about killing myself,

29:51.916 --> 29:55.916
but it's not fair to leave
without living my real life.

30:09.916 --> 30:13.208
The life nature wouldn't give me.

30:13.291 --> 30:15.041
What are you doing here?

30:16.375 --> 30:17.291
And you?

30:17.875 --> 30:19.541
Me? I'm his wife.

30:20.125 --> 30:22.583
-Jessi Del Monte.
-Rita.

30:22.666 --> 30:25.583
Rita Mora Castro, lawyer.
I work with your husband.

30:25.666 --> 30:28.916
I figured, but what do you do for him?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
A lot of things.

30:30.875 --> 30:32.708
Are we leaving the country?

30:32.791 --> 30:34.000
Excuse me?

30:37.833 --> 30:41.125
Sorry, I don't know anything about that.

30:42.833 --> 30:45.125
Who's the guy with you?

30:45.208 --> 30:46.666
So you've met?

30:46.750 --> 30:50.583
Yes. I was asking Rita
who the guy with you is.

30:50.666 --> 30:51.833
Business, honey.

30:52.541 --> 30:54.125
Where are the kids?

30:54.208 --> 30:55.958
Dancing with the others.

30:56.041 --> 30:57.125
Let's join them.

30:57.208 --> 30:58.208
Coming?

30:58.291 --> 31:00.791
No thanks, I'll just stay here.

31:02.125 --> 31:03.708
Nice meeting you!

31:36.583 --> 31:38.875
Ever since I'm able to think

31:39.583 --> 31:42.000
this is what I wanted.

31:42.083 --> 31:43.333
But…

31:44.291 --> 31:46.583
in the world I come from,

31:47.291 --> 31:48.583
it's very difficult.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.083
Very difficult.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.583
I must leave a great deal behind me.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.375
But…

32:08.708 --> 32:10.708
I have no choice.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.833
The passports with their new names.

33:08.916 --> 33:11.208
They'll have to learn them by heart.

33:15.416 --> 33:18.166
Here are the bank accounts.

33:19.541 --> 33:22.541
The wire transfers
are scheduled and secured

33:22.625 --> 33:25.291
as per your instructions.
They'll be rich.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.666
They'll live here, in Lausanne.

33:29.750 --> 33:32.083
Lakefront, spacious, calm.

33:32.166 --> 33:33.458
You know, Switzerland.

33:40.708 --> 33:44.083
I'll go with them
and help them settle in.

33:44.791 --> 33:47.708
I imagine it won't be easy at first,

33:48.708 --> 33:50.708
but over time,
they'll forget you.

33:55.291 --> 33:56.833
They'll forget you.

33:59.750 --> 34:03.916
I don't lack sky

34:04.541 --> 34:08.250
I don't lack sea

34:08.958 --> 34:13.083
I don't lack a voice

34:13.166 --> 34:17.958
But I lack singing

34:22.958 --> 34:27.541
I don't lack money

34:27.625 --> 34:31.375
I don't lack killing

34:32.250 --> 34:36.750
I don't lack lust

34:36.833 --> 34:40.791
But I lack desire

34:45.958 --> 34:50.250
I want another face

34:50.333 --> 34:55.000
I want another skin

34:55.083 --> 34:59.708
I want the depth of my soul

34:59.791 --> 35:03.875
To smell like honey

35:07.416 --> 35:14.416
I don't desire desire

35:16.541 --> 35:23.166
Or to be desired

35:25.625 --> 35:32.583
Let everything that was no longer be

35:35.000 --> 35:40.791
My only desire

35:41.875 --> 35:43.916
Is to be

35:44.000 --> 35:46.333
Her

36:08.541 --> 36:11.916
SWITZERLAND

36:19.708 --> 36:20.708
Welcome, Madam.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.291
Good evening, Madam.

36:28.875 --> 36:30.250
Welcome, ma'am.

36:31.958 --> 36:33.416
Welcome.

36:34.958 --> 36:38.125
This isn't our house!
I want to go home!

36:38.916 --> 36:42.250
Why did he do this to me?
What did I do to him?

36:42.333 --> 36:45.750
Nothing, it's to protect you, Jessi.

36:46.541 --> 36:50.000
If you go back,
your husband's enemies will hunt you

36:50.083 --> 36:51.583
and your children.

36:51.666 --> 36:53.708
He's sheltering you, see?

36:53.791 --> 36:55.041
Please,

36:55.125 --> 36:57.708
I don't want this.
I don't belong here.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.333
Please…

37:03.416 --> 37:06.625
-How long will this last?
-I don't know.

37:06.708 --> 37:07.708
Months?

37:08.500 --> 37:09.833
Maybe more.

37:25.541 --> 37:26.875
It's done.

37:26.958 --> 37:28.375
They moved in.

37:29.291 --> 37:30.916
It was very hard,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.375
but they're safe.

37:34.541 --> 37:36.708
Everything must disappear.

37:36.791 --> 37:38.000
You're rich now.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.541
Enjoy it.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.625
Your mission is over.

37:43.708 --> 37:44.625
All right.

37:44.708 --> 37:46.083
Farewell, Rita.

38:41.666 --> 38:45.458
DNA from human remains found in Veracruz
has been identified.

38:45.541 --> 38:47.083
Manitas Del Monte.

38:47.166 --> 38:50.750
The drug lord,
thought to have fled the country,

38:50.833 --> 38:54.500
had, in fact, fallen into the hands
of his enemies.

41:09.833 --> 41:11.250
Emilia…

41:15.166 --> 41:16.541
Pérez.

41:17.750 --> 41:21.708
Señora Emilia Pérez.

41:27.041 --> 41:28.833
Emilia Pérez.

41:31.625 --> 41:33.958
Señora Emilia Pérez.

41:34.791 --> 41:36.291
Pleased to meet you.

41:38.541 --> 41:40.875
I am Señora Emilia Pérez.

41:53.625 --> 41:58.083
FOUR YEARS LATER

42:01.208 --> 42:05.291
LONDON

42:58.166 --> 42:59.208
Me too.

42:59.291 --> 43:00.791
No kidding?

43:00.875 --> 43:02.041
What part?

43:02.125 --> 43:03.500
Monterrey.

43:09.708 --> 43:11.416
Gentlemen are rare nowadays.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.166
That's true.

43:13.250 --> 43:15.291
I'm from Veracruz.

43:15.375 --> 43:17.791
I was born in the Dominican Republic,

43:17.875 --> 43:21.208
but I went to school in Mexico.

43:21.291 --> 43:22.500
Lovely!

43:22.583 --> 43:24.083
It's nice speaking Spanish.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.041
You miss Mexico?

43:26.125 --> 43:27.250
Me?

43:28.875 --> 43:31.291
In fact, no, not really.

43:31.375 --> 43:34.291
Sometimes,
but I'd always wanted to travel

43:34.375 --> 43:35.666
and live elsewhere.

43:35.750 --> 43:36.791
And you?

43:36.875 --> 43:39.333
I've been in transit for ages.

43:39.416 --> 43:41.916
I even lost my northern accent.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
I hear it.

43:43.916 --> 43:46.041
-Who did you come with?
-Simon.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.250
He sees to my business in Europe.

43:49.333 --> 43:50.750
Simon?

43:50.833 --> 43:53.208
Actually, Simon and I…

44:04.291 --> 44:05.291
Is it you?

44:07.458 --> 44:08.416
Bingo.

44:09.541 --> 44:10.375
Shit.

44:23.541 --> 44:25.083
What are you doing here?

44:26.666 --> 44:28.166
I have business in London.

44:28.250 --> 44:29.791
Cut the crap.

44:31.208 --> 44:32.750
You had me tailed?

44:32.833 --> 44:34.458
Not at all. Don't worry.

44:34.541 --> 44:36.583
I don't recognize your voice.

44:37.541 --> 44:39.125
Just my voice?

44:46.208 --> 44:49.583
Don't tell me you came by chance

44:49.666 --> 44:52.375
That you're just passing through

44:53.166 --> 44:55.916
Don't tell me you came by chance

44:56.541 --> 44:59.916
Don't tell me you came by chance

45:00.000 --> 45:03.250
Tell me you came to erase the past

45:03.333 --> 45:06.916
To get rid of the last witness, me!

45:10.625 --> 45:13.250
Don't tell me you came here by chance

45:13.333 --> 45:16.458
Tell me that you came to kill me

45:17.166 --> 45:20.458
To clean up, so no one knows

45:20.541 --> 45:23.625
Who you were and what I know

45:23.708 --> 45:27.083
Don't tell me you came by chance

45:31.041 --> 45:34.416
No Rita, I haven't come by chance

45:34.500 --> 45:37.333
Nor have I come as a friend

45:37.416 --> 45:39.500
To thank you once more

45:39.583 --> 45:41.291
And toss you flowers

45:41.375 --> 45:44.208
No Rita, I haven't come by chance

45:44.833 --> 45:48.458
No Rita, I haven't come by chance

45:48.541 --> 45:51.041
I didn't come to look into your eyes

45:51.125 --> 45:54.875
And see the shock of your life

45:54.958 --> 45:58.416
"It's her, no it's not, yes it is her!"

45:58.500 --> 46:00.791
I didn't come to look in a mirror

46:01.500 --> 46:04.750
Or to tell you my life either

46:05.291 --> 46:07.000
That I changed skin and body

46:07.083 --> 46:08.500
Suffered like hell

46:08.583 --> 46:10.250
But it was worth it

46:10.333 --> 46:13.458
That I'm happy now, I'm myself

46:15.583 --> 46:20.000
No Rita, I didn't come for any of that

46:22.458 --> 46:25.666
No Rita, I haven't come by chance

46:25.750 --> 46:29.208
You can flee, run away, I won't stop you

46:29.291 --> 46:31.625
But one day you may understand

46:32.291 --> 46:33.833
What it's like to change lives

46:33.916 --> 46:36.083
And leave everything behind

46:39.208 --> 46:41.666
I have something to ask you

46:41.750 --> 46:45.208
Something to ask me by chance?

46:53.125 --> 46:56.125
I need you to bring my children
back to Mexico.

47:00.833 --> 47:02.750
I can't live without them.

47:05.458 --> 47:07.041
I beg of you.

47:21.625 --> 47:23.250
Where will we live?

47:23.333 --> 47:24.625
Her place.

47:24.708 --> 47:26.666
She has a mansion in Las Lomas.

47:27.333 --> 47:29.541
Do you know this Emilia Pérez?

47:33.000 --> 47:36.500
Manitas mentioned a distant cousin

47:36.583 --> 47:39.541
you could trust,
if anything happened.

47:39.625 --> 47:42.166
She knew how to join me.

47:42.250 --> 47:44.750
When it was time,
she sent me for you.

47:58.833 --> 48:00.666
I knew nothing of this.

48:01.291 --> 48:02.375
No one…

48:02.958 --> 48:04.333
No one could know.

48:20.375 --> 48:24.291
MEXICO CITY

48:29.958 --> 48:32.583
Madam Emilia, they're coming!

48:36.708 --> 48:38.208
My children!

48:38.875 --> 48:40.166
My family. Jessi.

48:40.250 --> 48:42.666
They're coming. Hurry!

48:45.083 --> 48:46.416
Help them, quick!

49:01.375 --> 49:02.708
Welcome.

49:03.625 --> 49:05.500
Welcome to your home.

49:08.625 --> 49:09.916
Come.

49:23.708 --> 49:26.000
We've never met, right, Jessi?

49:29.083 --> 49:30.875
No, I don't think so.

49:36.375 --> 49:38.041
You were Manitas' wife.

49:38.666 --> 49:40.875
He left us. Peace be with him.

49:41.833 --> 49:43.625
You're like my sister now.

49:44.875 --> 49:47.375
This is your home. Welcome.

49:48.166 --> 49:49.625
Thank you, ma'am.

49:49.708 --> 49:51.291
Emilia, please.

49:54.916 --> 49:55.916
Guys!

49:56.000 --> 49:57.583
Want to see your rooms?

49:58.208 --> 49:59.208
Want to?

50:00.916 --> 50:03.666
Careful, there's no railing.

50:06.375 --> 50:08.916
Rita, you'll stay with us?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.208
No, I'm at the Four Seasons.

50:11.291 --> 50:13.250
That's mine, thanks.

50:13.333 --> 50:15.666
I have to get back to London.

50:15.750 --> 50:17.166
Wait a second.

50:29.375 --> 50:30.750
How do you find her?

50:31.458 --> 50:32.875
Totally out of it.

50:32.958 --> 50:34.916
You know her better than me.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.875
I did before.
I don't know about now.

50:38.541 --> 50:41.458
Don't dwell on how others have changed.

50:42.708 --> 50:44.125
You're right.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.416
It's a miracle she didn't recognize you.

50:48.041 --> 50:50.000
Be careful with the children.

50:50.625 --> 50:51.708
Why?

50:52.375 --> 50:54.583
Stop kissing them all the time.

50:55.125 --> 50:57.375
You're their aunt, not their mother.

51:05.833 --> 51:07.166
Anything else?

51:07.250 --> 51:08.583
No, thank you.

51:11.250 --> 51:12.416
You don't like it?

51:15.333 --> 51:16.541
Not talking to me?

51:18.041 --> 51:19.833
Do we have to go to school?

51:20.625 --> 51:22.166
Yes.

51:22.250 --> 51:23.916
Children go to school.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.208
And their parents go to work.

51:26.291 --> 51:27.666
Mommy doesn't work.

51:28.291 --> 51:29.583
That's true.

51:30.208 --> 51:31.916
I don't want to go to school here.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Me neither.

51:33.833 --> 51:35.500
What do you want to do?

51:36.500 --> 51:38.083
Can we stay with Mommy?

51:38.666 --> 51:40.791
I want to ski like in Switzerland.

51:40.875 --> 51:42.333
What?

51:42.416 --> 51:44.125
Skiing in the snow.

51:44.208 --> 51:45.208
Me too.

52:01.750 --> 52:03.125
Good morning, ma'am.

52:03.708 --> 52:04.875
Your breakfast.

52:18.750 --> 52:20.833
Welcome

52:20.916 --> 52:24.708
To your beloved country, my darling

52:25.416 --> 52:29.041
To your luxurious home, cousin dear

52:29.791 --> 52:32.291
Where everything's costly

52:32.375 --> 52:34.041
Pleased to meet you!

52:34.125 --> 52:36.375
And many thanks to the family

52:36.458 --> 52:38.291
Welcome

52:38.375 --> 52:42.000
Be polite
Say hello, my dear

52:42.958 --> 52:46.458
To the big boss Aunt Emilia

52:46.541 --> 52:50.541
And the new guards, cousin dear

52:50.625 --> 52:52.833
Of your gilded prison

52:52.916 --> 52:54.666
Welcome

52:54.750 --> 52:58.166
To your fairy trap, cousin dear

52:58.250 --> 53:02.583
To the life of your dreams, my pretty

53:02.666 --> 53:06.333
Look at that clothesline, dear child

53:06.416 --> 53:09.791
All that laundered money hanging to dry

53:10.500 --> 53:13.833
Look at your golden handcuffs, my dear

53:13.916 --> 53:17.583
Your padlock necklaces, cousin dear

53:17.666 --> 53:20.041
You'll feel so good in here

53:20.125 --> 53:21.250
Fool

53:21.333 --> 53:23.833
You'll never want to run away

53:23.916 --> 53:25.083
Welcome

53:28.291 --> 53:30.208
I obeyed my dead man

53:30.291 --> 53:31.750
In Switzerland

53:31.833 --> 53:34.083
I took care of our kids

53:34.166 --> 53:35.291
Enough!

53:35.375 --> 53:37.416
I cried my eyes out

53:37.500 --> 53:38.666
Fool

53:38.750 --> 53:40.750
I took care of everything

53:40.833 --> 53:42.208
Welcome

53:42.291 --> 53:44.125
I'm at your service

53:44.208 --> 53:45.125
Fuck you

53:45.208 --> 53:47.625
Now don't mess with me

53:47.708 --> 53:48.708
Cousin dear

53:48.791 --> 53:51.250
I'll jump over the wall, my darling

53:51.958 --> 53:54.083
I'll quench my thirst

53:54.166 --> 53:55.416
Welcome

53:57.000 --> 53:58.916
Venerated

54:00.000 --> 54:01.708
Excited

54:03.416 --> 54:05.000
Admired

54:05.750 --> 54:07.333
Overjoyed

54:07.416 --> 54:08.916
Adulated

54:09.000 --> 54:10.500
Mega-liked

54:10.583 --> 54:13.500
Welcome

54:46.666 --> 54:50.708
I don't know
if this is Gustavo Brun's number.

54:50.791 --> 54:52.083
It's Jessi.

54:53.166 --> 54:55.208
If it's your number, Gustavo,

54:55.291 --> 54:59.625
I wanted you to know…
that lawyer, Rita Mora,

55:00.291 --> 55:04.541
called to tell me I could come back.

55:05.541 --> 55:10.125
That I no longer risked getting shot
stepping off the plane.

55:11.750 --> 55:12.916
And I…

55:17.791 --> 55:19.000
Gustavo,

55:19.916 --> 55:22.708
you're the reason I came back.

55:24.291 --> 55:29.166
My pussy still hurts
when I think of you.

56:04.583 --> 56:05.583
And if I pay you?

56:07.291 --> 56:08.416
For what?

56:09.041 --> 56:10.125
For you to stay.

56:10.208 --> 56:12.625
Enough with that.

56:12.708 --> 56:13.750
What would I do?

56:14.333 --> 56:16.083
Nothing, just stay around.

56:17.041 --> 56:18.458
That's kind of you.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
But no.

56:20.083 --> 56:20.958
Thanks.

56:21.041 --> 56:23.375
What's up in London?
You have someone.

56:23.458 --> 56:25.833
Work is the only thing that's up.

56:25.916 --> 56:29.791
I offer you to stay and do nothing,
and you want to go?

56:31.041 --> 56:32.583
You want children?

56:33.208 --> 56:35.541
I do. I just need a father.

56:35.625 --> 56:36.625
We'll buy one.

56:37.458 --> 56:38.541
Tell me.

56:38.625 --> 56:41.500
Tell me who you want
and I'll buy him.

56:41.583 --> 56:42.875
Him?

56:42.958 --> 56:44.500
You like him?

56:53.083 --> 56:55.291
MISSING: OCTAVIO VARGAS

56:57.833 --> 56:59.500
That's Octavio.

56:59.583 --> 57:02.166
My eldest. He was 23.

57:02.833 --> 57:05.416
He disappeared in 2013, on November 18,

57:05.500 --> 57:07.000
in the Michoacán.

57:08.333 --> 57:09.875
He was a student.

57:10.458 --> 57:12.666
He disappeared on a trip down south.

57:13.875 --> 57:16.041
He wanted to be a teacher.

57:16.125 --> 57:17.125
I'm sorry.

57:26.583 --> 57:27.500
Edgar…

57:44.000 --> 57:46.541
You ever think, once in a while,

57:46.625 --> 57:48.458
about everything Manitas did?

57:49.583 --> 57:50.791
All the horror?

57:50.875 --> 57:52.041
Quiet, not here.

57:53.833 --> 57:55.791
I don't know who Manitas is.

57:57.125 --> 57:58.916
Yes, I think about that.

57:59.916 --> 58:02.208
And there's a lot that I regret.

58:03.458 --> 58:04.625
Of course.

59:28.500 --> 59:29.625
Auntie Emi?

59:32.750 --> 59:34.166
Why are you up?

59:35.291 --> 59:37.125
I can't fall asleep.

59:37.208 --> 59:39.208
You'll wake up your brother.

59:42.416 --> 59:43.958
Close your eyes.

59:51.541 --> 59:52.708
What are you doing?

59:56.333 --> 59:57.750
You smell like Papa.

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:02.291
I love it.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Do you miss him?

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:09.666
Yes.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.125
Papa, Papa…

01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:25.833
You smell like Papa

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.541
You smell like the mountains

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:32.750
Leather and coffee

01:00:32.833 --> 01:00:35.125
You smell like food

01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:37.625
Spicy, spicy!

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:40.208
You smell like sugar

01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:42.416
Lamb roasting on the fire

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.916
The engine of the car

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:50.416
You also smell like Coca

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.625
Cola

01:00:51.708 --> 01:00:52.708
Light

01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:54.041
With lemon

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:55.291
Ice cubes

01:00:55.375 --> 01:00:57.791
And sweat

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:02.208
You smell like Papa

01:01:03.541 --> 01:01:04.666
Would you rather

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.333
I wear perfume?

01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:07.333
Auntie…

01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:08.958
I like how you smell

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:13.250
but I don't like the perfume you use.

01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:16.875
He smelled of little pebbles

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:19.291
Hot from the sun

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.875
He smelled like grass

01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:24.291
Like mezcal and guacamole

01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:26.791
He smelled like dogs

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:29.166
In car rides

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.500
He smelled like cigars

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:33.875
When he hugged us

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:36.500
For the last time

01:01:38.416 --> 01:01:41.000
The last time

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:30.541
CENTRAL PRISON

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:58.750
Do you know him?

01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:04.666
Fuck, no.

01:03:07.666 --> 01:03:09.000
I don't recognize the face.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:13.208
Maybe from when we stole hostages

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.708
from the Tiburones.

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:17.875
It got ugly.

01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:21.500
We had to get rid of them in town.

01:03:21.583 --> 01:03:22.583
Where?

01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.250
The old San Cristóbal refinery.

01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:28.500
When she kissed my hand,
I felt her tears,

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.750
and for the first time, I loved myself.

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:42.875
How many disappearances
in this country?

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:46.125
Tens of thousands.

01:04:47.291 --> 01:04:48.666
It's horrific.

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:52.875
We can't stand idly by.

01:04:53.583 --> 01:04:55.041
We must help them.

01:04:57.666 --> 01:04:58.500
How?

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:02.208
I know former sicarios
willing to do good.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.291
That's too dangerous for you.

01:05:08.291 --> 01:05:10.708
-You'll go see them.
-Me?

01:05:11.791 --> 01:05:13.458
You're a lawyer.

01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:16.583
You'll persuade them.

01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:26.208
We left them scattered over the Sinaloa.

01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:27.416
We burned them.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:32.541
Some were taken to Tierra Caliente,

01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:34.166
near Guerrero.

01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:36.625
Others in Veracruz.

01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:40.416
The town of San Martín.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.291
Otherwise we cut them into pieces.

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:45.166
Did you bury them?

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:48.666
We dismembered them
and left them on the road.

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:49.875
When was this?

01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:51.916
Two years ago.

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:54.083
Just you?

01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:56.208
No, with the gang.

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:59.000
-How many?
-Four.

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:01.333
-Was it a family?
-Yes.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:04.208
There was a mother, two brothers,

01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:06.500
and a friend of theirs, I guess.

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:09.500
We grabbed the old man
and put him in the van.

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:12.291
When we got there, we killed him.

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:13.541
We burned them.

01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:16.458
We left no traces.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.666
We burned them.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:19.750
Threw them in the river.

01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:24.000
We ran all over the country
to destroy the evidence.

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:38.958
Hello, everyone.

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:41.500
Señora Pérez, why "La Lucecita"?

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:44.041
Named after our goal.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.500
A ray of hope for those with none.

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:48.750
How will your NGO be financed?

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:52.791
With my money,
but we'll take help from anyone.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:53.791
Thank you.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:57.875
All information will be available
in the NGO's charter.

01:06:57.958 --> 01:07:00.083
Thank you, now excuse us.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:04.375
Our NGO operates
in compliance with the law.

01:07:04.458 --> 01:07:06.750
We are not a replacement
for public services.

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:10.291
We work with them
to help those who need it most.

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.833
Our main goal

01:07:12.916 --> 01:07:16.125
is to help families
find their loved ones.

01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:17.708
Here there are no guilty parties.

01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:19.250
We don't judge anyone.

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:23.000
For a new life, a new horizon,

01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:24.375
La Lucecita.

01:07:46.583 --> 01:07:50.958
So that I know
Where, when and how it happened

01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:55.041
So I can tell those he loved
How it ended

01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:59.666
So his friends can mourn him

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:04.416
So that I know
Where the bad people hid her

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.666
So that I can engrave his dates

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:12.041
I am here

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:16.291
So I can talk about the color
Of his face

01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:21.250
I am here

01:08:24.416 --> 01:08:28.541
So that I can look myself in the mirror

01:08:28.625 --> 01:08:33.166
So I can raise my children
With clean money

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:37.500
So there can be a life before
And a life after

01:08:37.583 --> 01:08:42.000
So I can learn to calculate
That one plus two makes three

01:08:42.083 --> 01:08:46.166
So I can cleanse my skin of tattoos

01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:49.750
I am here

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:54.708
So I can put my errors to good use

01:08:55.958 --> 01:08:58.250
I am here

01:08:58.333 --> 01:09:00.583
I am here

01:09:07.833 --> 01:09:09.041
I am here

01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:13.125
So that the disappeared can reappear

01:09:13.208 --> 01:09:17.458
So mother and child can be reunited

01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:20.125
So we can look the nightmare

01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:22.041
In the eyes

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:26.458
So deep down, there is strength and hope

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:30.916
So we can overcome society's mockery

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.375
So we can cross over and face evil

01:09:35.458 --> 01:09:39.833
So that our hearts can scream the truth

01:09:39.916 --> 01:09:44.333
So we can walk, our heads held high

01:09:44.416 --> 01:09:48.250
So we can eat, live and breathe

01:09:49.333 --> 01:09:52.333
We are here

01:09:53.291 --> 01:09:57.250
So we can ask for forgiveness and forgive

01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:01.708
We are here

01:11:40.791 --> 01:11:41.958
Evening, beautiful.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.666
Have a good time?

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:48.041
Yes.

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:49.083
Want some?

01:11:50.291 --> 01:11:51.500
Whisky?

01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:52.583
Sure.

01:12:05.291 --> 01:12:06.500
Can I ask you something?

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:15.625
How was it with your husband?

01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:19.291
I don't know.

01:12:20.458 --> 01:12:22.041
What do you mean?

01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:23.666
Did you love him?

01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:27.000
I was crazy for him.

01:12:31.958 --> 01:12:33.083
Did he love you?

01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:38.125
I don't know.

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:40.083
After the kids were born…

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.875
For you or for him?

01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:48.833
For him.

01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:52.208
Did it make you sad?

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:56.375
I was alone.

01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:04.166
What would have happened
if he hadn't died?

01:13:05.833 --> 01:13:07.000
I don't know.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.458
He'd have done like the others.

01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:12.875
He'd have found himself a younger one.

01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:17.750
He'd have had kids with her
and sent me to hell.

01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:22.000
Or maybe I'd have found another guy.

01:13:23.375 --> 01:13:24.458
Did you cheat on him?

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:30.500
With who?

01:13:32.166 --> 01:13:33.416
Why do you ask?

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:37.000
No reason.

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:38.583
Simple curiosity.

01:13:46.541 --> 01:13:47.541
Did it last long?

01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:51.791
Why not?

01:13:55.208 --> 01:13:57.500
It was too intense.

01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:00.833
I couldn't think about anything else.

01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:04.875
I'd never experienced anything like it.

01:14:05.625 --> 01:14:06.625
What happened?

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:10.166
Nothing.

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:11.458
I ended it.

01:14:12.416 --> 01:14:14.166
I stopped wanting to see him.

01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:20.750
You never thought
about running off together?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.583
Did you know your cousin
or not at all?

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.875
No matter where we went,

01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:30.708
he'd have found us.

01:14:30.791 --> 01:14:34.333
He'd have cut us into pieces
and fed us to the dogs.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:37.208
I'm going to bed.

01:14:41.166 --> 01:14:42.333
Goodnight.

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:05.958
This is Channel 3,
here with Señora Pérez.

01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:09.333
The victims seem to have been murdered

01:15:09.416 --> 01:15:10.458
by Los Globales,

01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:14.208
one of Mexico's largest cartels.

01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:16.875
What do you have to say, Ms. Pérez?

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:19.416
I'd like to emphasize that

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:22.583
almost 100,000 people
are missing in Mexico,

01:15:22.666 --> 01:15:25.041
victims of drug-traffic related violence.

01:15:25.125 --> 01:15:29.250
After discovering
what can only be called a mass grave,

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:32.041
the Department of Public Safety

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
didn't open an investigation.

01:15:35.083 --> 01:15:37.791
They didn't even send a team here.

01:15:37.875 --> 01:15:39.333
About that,

01:15:39.416 --> 01:15:42.125
there's another point
I insist on making.

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:45.333
We've had to enlist
the help of other cities.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:48.958
Police here
don't have sufficient resources

01:15:49.041 --> 01:15:53.375
to lead the investigations
that need to be led.

01:15:55.916 --> 01:15:59.041
BENEFIT GALA
FOR FAMILIES OF THE DISAPPEARED

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.125
What are you hoping for?

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:17.625
Empathy and support.

01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:20.333
-You mean money?
-Dough, yeah.

01:16:20.416 --> 01:16:21.666
Financial support.

01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:22.916
Thank you.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.333
I saw the guest list.

01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:33.958
Who are the people you added?

01:16:34.041 --> 01:16:36.791
Drug kingpins,
corrupt officials, crooks.

01:16:36.875 --> 01:16:37.708
You mind?

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.791
If we're funded with dirty money,

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:45.250
yes, I mind.

01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:49.083
I don't know any British royals yet,

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:51.250
so I invite the rich guys I know.

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:55.041
How do I look?

01:16:55.125 --> 01:16:56.291
Gorgeous.

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:57.875
And now let's greet…

01:16:57.958 --> 01:16:59.583
-How about me?
-…Emilia Pérez!

01:17:01.125 --> 01:17:02.708
Fucking bitch.

01:17:06.666 --> 01:17:08.041
Rita!

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:10.833
I'm Berlinger, your old boss.
Remember?

01:17:10.916 --> 01:17:12.583
Call me when you can.

01:17:12.666 --> 01:17:16.000
How wonderful to see you here tonight.

01:17:16.916 --> 01:17:20.458
I am proud and satisfied, truly.

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:22.666
Esteemed ministers,

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:24.291
esteemed senators,

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.916
representatives
of the Chamber of Commerce,

01:17:28.583 --> 01:17:30.083
Minister of the Interior,

01:17:30.166 --> 01:17:31.541
Minister of Culture.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:33.416
Look at the Chemist

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.458
Got made Minister of something

01:17:36.125 --> 01:17:39.458
Had his partner's throat slit
His family's too

01:17:39.541 --> 01:17:41.250
What about the corpses?

01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:42.750
Acid!

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:44.583
Look at Judge Santos

01:17:44.666 --> 01:17:46.833
Cares only about children

01:17:46.916 --> 01:17:48.291
Cartels kidnap them

01:17:48.375 --> 01:17:51.000
Steal them from their villages

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.916
And Santos has their cases dismissed

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
No evidence

01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:58.791
Talk, all these people talk

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:01.583
But now they are going to pay

01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:13.125
You have the upper hand

01:18:13.208 --> 01:18:14.791
Everyone knows you

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:17.041
No one knows me

01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:19.125
Or barely

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:20.625
I am Emilia Pérez

01:18:20.708 --> 01:18:22.416
A Mexican woman!

01:18:22.958 --> 01:18:24.791
A woman like any other!

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.375
Look at the Minister of Public Education

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:30.666
Specialist in shell companies

01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:32.083
The contracts are real

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:34.583
But the schools aren't

01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:35.958
So now tell us!

01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:39.541
Where did you get
Your jet, your pool, your hotel?

01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:41.833
Look at the Governor

01:18:41.916 --> 01:18:44.041
Who voted him in? The cartel?

01:18:44.125 --> 01:18:47.416
They bought the farmer vote one by one

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.875
Pay the cartel

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:53.666
They're already sitting
On your fucking throne

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.750
Talk, all these people talk

01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:02.583
But now they are going to pay

01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:13.083
And thank God

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:16.625
I have by my side an exceptional woman

01:19:16.708 --> 01:19:18.791
Rita Mora Castro!

01:19:18.875 --> 01:19:21.666
She is intelligence incarnate!

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:24.958
Intelligence incarnate!

01:19:26.666 --> 01:19:27.541
Look at the Gimp

01:19:27.625 --> 01:19:29.333
Not lame from birth

01:19:29.875 --> 01:19:31.583
Next time you pay late

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:33.625
You'll end up in a wheelchair

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.625
Or like him, without a hand

01:19:35.708 --> 01:19:39.250
Be on time if you're corrupt

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:43.583
Look at our dear Mendoza

01:19:43.666 --> 01:19:46.583
With his new wife

01:19:46.666 --> 01:19:48.458
Very young

01:19:49.416 --> 01:19:51.416
Very blonde

01:19:52.583 --> 01:19:55.125
Blonde!

01:19:57.833 --> 01:20:00.666
Talk, all these people talk

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:03.458
But now they are going to pay

01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:18.208
Losing a loved one is a tragedy

01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:20.000
Losing their remains

01:20:20.083 --> 01:20:23.541
Is a life sentence!

01:20:23.625 --> 01:20:26.458
A life sentence!

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:37.583
Earthquake!

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.083
Cheers!

01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:12.125
Come in.

01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:16.458
Mrs. Epifanía Flores.

01:21:16.541 --> 01:21:18.125
Show her in, thanks.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.166
Go on in.

01:21:24.416 --> 01:21:26.125
Come in, have a seat.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.083
What can I do for you?

01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:46.708
You found my husband.

01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:53.291
Where is he?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.166
At the morgue.

01:21:59.625 --> 01:22:00.708
At the morgue?

01:22:03.583 --> 01:22:05.000
What's he doing there?

01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:07.416
He's dead.

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:11.541
Are you sure it's him?

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:17.416
Yes, 99.99%.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.625
I'm sorry.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.416
Excuse me.

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:47.291
I'm very sorry.

01:22:50.875 --> 01:22:52.291
Excuse me.

01:23:04.291 --> 01:23:07.041
Forgive me, perhaps I was too abrupt.

01:23:11.708 --> 01:23:13.458
I thought he was going to be here.

01:23:15.166 --> 01:23:17.000
I was so scared.

01:23:17.083 --> 01:23:18.750
I had five years of peace.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.375
Then I got your letter…

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:27.125
He used to hit me,
steal my money, rape me.

01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:30.916
If he weren't dead, I'd…

01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:34.208
I'd have…

01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:42.250
I even brought a knife.

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:51.458
No one can hurt you anymore.

01:23:52.708 --> 01:23:53.875
It's over.

01:23:59.958 --> 01:24:01.750
Do you want anything?

01:24:01.833 --> 01:24:02.916
Water?

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:05.541
Are you okay?

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:08.250
Yes, I am.

01:24:13.416 --> 01:24:14.916
Have a good day, Mrs. Flores.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.125
Thanks a lot.

01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:29.625
Mrs. Flores!

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.625
Tell me,

01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:33.791
what do we do with the corpse?

01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:36.291
Throw it away!

01:24:36.375 --> 01:24:37.625
That's it?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.666
You really brought a knife?

01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:54.333
Can we meet again?

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.416
What for?

01:24:57.083 --> 01:24:58.625
Just to see each other.

01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:00.250
Yes.

01:25:02.958 --> 01:25:03.958
Goodbye.

01:25:48.291 --> 01:25:49.750
You found everything?

01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:57.125
Leaving already?

01:25:59.166 --> 01:26:01.333
To get home
before the kids wake up.

01:26:02.583 --> 01:26:03.583
Kids?

01:26:05.625 --> 01:26:06.875
You have children?

01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:08.750
Yes.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.375
Well, no.

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:12.708
Same difference.

01:26:13.916 --> 01:26:15.416
Same difference?

01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:19.166
Their father died.
I'm their aunt.

01:26:40.291 --> 01:26:41.583
Will I see you again?

01:26:45.208 --> 01:26:46.208
You want to?

01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:48.125
Yeah, I do.

01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:49.041
You?

01:26:59.583 --> 01:27:00.875
Love me

01:27:00.958 --> 01:27:02.375
Protect me

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:06.625
Half him

01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:08.208
Half her

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:09.833
Half papa

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.875
Half aunt

01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:13.750
Half rich

01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:15.791
Half poor

01:27:15.875 --> 01:27:17.375
Half kingpin

01:27:17.916 --> 01:27:19.375
Half queen

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.083
Half here

01:27:21.625 --> 01:27:22.958
Half there

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.166
Half dead

01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:26.708
Half alive

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:28.458
Half inside

01:27:29.166 --> 01:27:30.666
Half out

01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:32.875
Everything

01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:34.666
Nothing

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:37.708
Who am I? I've no idea

01:27:37.791 --> 01:27:40.791
I am what I feel

01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:44.166
And for the first time

01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:48.458
I feel a feeling

01:27:50.041 --> 01:27:52.583
Life without love

01:27:52.666 --> 01:27:55.833
Has been an endless fall

01:27:57.083 --> 01:27:59.250
What joy

01:27:59.958 --> 01:28:02.625
To make love with love

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.458
Emilia

01:28:13.166 --> 01:28:19.291
Epifanía

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:32.708
Half me

01:28:32.791 --> 01:28:34.500
Half her

01:28:34.583 --> 01:28:36.500
Half together

01:28:36.583 --> 01:28:37.916
Half alone

01:28:38.541 --> 01:28:40.000
Half down

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.083
Half up

01:28:42.166 --> 01:28:44.041
At the beginning

01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:45.791
And at the end

01:28:46.416 --> 01:28:48.791
Who am I? I've no idea

01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:52.083
I was born at this very moment

01:28:52.666 --> 01:28:55.750
I was born of her desire

01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:59.666
I was born from her belly

01:29:01.208 --> 01:29:03.458
Life without desire

01:29:04.083 --> 01:29:06.791
Has been like a mountain

01:29:07.625 --> 01:29:10.541
Now my desire

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.541
Leads me to the river

01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:19.541
I am in love

01:29:23.083 --> 01:29:26.333
In love

01:29:55.458 --> 01:29:58.375
-How did you learn this?
-What?

01:29:58.958 --> 01:30:01.000
You change people's lives.

01:30:01.083 --> 01:30:03.541
Not just them. Me.

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:05.333
Everyone.

01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:08.625
I spent my life studying, and for what?

01:30:08.708 --> 01:30:11.416
So the rich get richer,
and the bastards get worse.

01:30:12.666 --> 01:30:14.041
Is something wrong?

01:30:15.666 --> 01:30:17.541
I'm 40 years old, Emilia.

01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:22.958
My love life is a desert
and my professional life, a sewer.

01:30:23.041 --> 01:30:24.125
What can I say?

01:30:24.791 --> 01:30:25.791
Nothing.

01:30:28.416 --> 01:30:29.500
Nothing.

01:30:32.541 --> 01:30:34.625
None of this would exist without you.

01:30:35.166 --> 01:30:37.041
This is your professional life.

01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:39.208
You should be proud.

01:30:39.833 --> 01:30:40.833
Am I wrong?

01:30:44.375 --> 01:30:45.375
Thanks.

01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:48.750
I want to love myself

01:31:48.833 --> 01:31:52.375
I want to love my life

01:31:52.458 --> 01:31:56.750
To love what I feel

01:31:58.291 --> 01:32:03.708
I want to love myself

01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:07.458
To love myself fully

01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:11.875
To love myself as I am

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:16.833
I want to love the little girl

01:32:16.916 --> 01:32:20.291
That they wouldn't let me be

01:32:20.375 --> 01:32:24.083
I want to love the old lady

01:32:24.166 --> 01:32:27.791
That I may become one day

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:31.416
I want to love myself every day

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.791
Every hour, every second

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.208
I am, and that's enough

01:32:38.291 --> 01:32:42.291
That's what being a woman is, right?

01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:46.458
I want to love myself

01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:49.583
The way I want to be loved

01:32:52.583 --> 01:32:58.166
I want to love myself

01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:01.916
To love my life

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.583
Love myself the way I am

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:10.125
If I fall off a cliff

01:33:10.208 --> 01:33:11.125
It's my cliff

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:13.333
If I double over in pain

01:33:13.916 --> 01:33:15.041
It's my pain

01:33:15.125 --> 01:33:17.583
If I go to seventh heaven

01:33:17.666 --> 01:33:18.750
It's my heaven

01:33:18.833 --> 01:33:22.250
If I go down the wrong path

01:33:22.333 --> 01:33:24.041
Who cares?

01:33:24.125 --> 01:33:26.583
It's my path

01:34:10.375 --> 01:34:11.708
Stand straight.

01:34:12.291 --> 01:34:13.750
25 seconds.

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.250
The scent of my boys!

01:34:41.625 --> 01:34:42.958
I'll pick them up.

01:34:44.541 --> 01:34:45.916
I entrust them to you.

01:35:32.625 --> 01:35:33.791
Hi, Jessi.

01:35:34.625 --> 01:35:37.083
-You scared me.
-Sorry.

01:35:37.666 --> 01:35:40.208
Do as you please here, but…

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:42.875
-I know, the children.
-Yes.

01:35:42.958 --> 01:35:45.375
Just be careful. They're young.

01:35:45.458 --> 01:35:46.625
I know, I said.

01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:48.750
Thanks.

01:35:49.458 --> 01:35:51.458
I have something to tell you.

01:35:52.916 --> 01:35:53.833
Go on.

01:36:01.583 --> 01:36:03.791
Getting married? To who?

01:36:05.125 --> 01:36:06.291
Gustavo.

01:36:07.041 --> 01:36:09.416
Still seeing that guy?

01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:14.375
Doesn't this seem… a little hasty?

01:36:16.125 --> 01:36:19.000
I've been waiting 5 years for this.

01:36:23.916 --> 01:36:26.375
If you're happy, I'm happy.

01:36:31.458 --> 01:36:33.041
Where will you be living?

01:36:34.666 --> 01:36:37.291
We're looking at a villa in Polanco.

01:36:38.541 --> 01:36:40.500
-And the kids?
-What about them?

01:36:41.625 --> 01:36:43.083
They're staying here.

01:36:43.166 --> 01:36:45.833
No. Why? They'll live with us.

01:36:48.041 --> 01:36:51.250
And this villa in Polanco has a garden?

01:36:51.333 --> 01:36:53.416
Yes, it has everything.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.333
Any good schools there?

01:36:55.416 --> 01:36:56.791
We haven't looked yet.

01:36:58.916 --> 01:37:00.208
When you say…

01:37:01.875 --> 01:37:03.791
"The children will live with us",

01:37:04.458 --> 01:37:06.041
you mean you and your pimp?

01:37:08.208 --> 01:37:09.041
What?

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:13.583
When you say
"the children will live with us,"

01:37:13.666 --> 01:37:16.541
you mean with you
and your fucking pimp?

01:37:17.458 --> 01:37:18.625
My pimp?

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:23.333
Who are you to talk,
fucking old dyke?

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:27.375
Want me to tell you about your whore?

01:37:29.291 --> 01:37:31.625
You can go fuck your mother

01:37:31.708 --> 01:37:33.458
with your fucking pimp,

01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:34.458
but my children

01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:36.041
stay here!

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.208
They're my children.

01:37:45.708 --> 01:37:47.291
Your children?

01:37:47.375 --> 01:37:48.416
Your children?

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.708
Are you out of your mind?

01:37:50.791 --> 01:37:52.333
They're my children!

01:37:52.958 --> 01:37:54.500
My children!

01:38:22.625 --> 01:38:25.583
Here's 100,000.
Get out of Mexico City.

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:28.208
If I see you again,
you're dog meat.

01:38:28.291 --> 01:38:29.291
Get it?

01:39:06.458 --> 01:39:07.708
What time did they leave?

01:39:08.291 --> 01:39:10.375
I don't know.
Everyone was asleep.

01:39:12.208 --> 01:39:13.958
They didn't leave a note?

01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:15.500
I didn't find one.

01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:47.791
Jessi, it's me, Emilia.

01:39:49.375 --> 01:39:51.125
I don't know why you did this.

01:39:52.166 --> 01:39:54.083
Call me when you can, please.

01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:03.750
She left with the children

01:40:03.833 --> 01:40:07.416
With my sons and all their stuff
To Polanco for sure

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.208
With her pimp

01:40:09.291 --> 01:40:10.875
She can't do this

01:40:10.958 --> 01:40:13.958
Okay, I get it, she's the mother

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:17.333
Then what am I?
I won't let her do this

01:40:17.416 --> 01:40:18.416
Calm down

01:40:18.958 --> 01:40:20.416
Don't worry

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:21.666
Calm down

01:40:22.166 --> 01:40:23.458
Relax

01:40:23.541 --> 01:40:24.375
Calm down

01:40:24.458 --> 01:40:26.000
I can't even buy food

01:40:26.083 --> 01:40:28.291
No more money
She cut me off

01:40:28.375 --> 01:40:30.291
None of my cards works

01:40:30.375 --> 01:40:32.125
All my accounts, blocked

01:40:32.208 --> 01:40:35.166
She wanted to take my kids
And now my money?

01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:36.416
Calm down

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:37.875
She wants to steal my kids

01:40:38.583 --> 01:40:41.333
How could I have married that slut?

01:40:41.416 --> 01:40:44.000
How could I have married that ingrate?

01:40:44.083 --> 01:40:45.833
You should have thought twice

01:40:45.916 --> 01:40:47.291
What do you think?

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:50.166
You can manipulate people as you please?

01:40:50.250 --> 01:40:51.916
That was another life

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.791
Things are different now

01:40:55.041 --> 01:40:57.291
How could I have lived with her?

01:40:57.375 --> 01:41:00.333
How could I have trusted that bitch?

01:41:00.416 --> 01:41:03.583
I don't know why she did it
I'll talk to her

01:41:03.666 --> 01:41:06.166
I'll sort it out
I'll set things right

01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:08.666
It's Manitas's money, my husband's

01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:11.500
The money he left me when he died

01:41:11.583 --> 01:41:12.791
She can't do this

01:41:12.875 --> 01:41:15.291
How the fuck could you do this?

01:41:15.375 --> 01:41:16.875
Why not tell me first?

01:41:16.958 --> 01:41:19.041
How can she access my accounts?

01:41:19.125 --> 01:41:20.291
Calm down

01:41:20.375 --> 01:41:21.625
Don't worry

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:25.708
It was done by Manitas
Your husband, to protect you

01:41:25.791 --> 01:41:27.000
I want my children

01:41:27.083 --> 01:41:30.916
If you want your children
You must put out the fire

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.833
I want my children

01:41:32.916 --> 01:41:35.541
You must put out the fire

01:41:35.625 --> 01:41:38.208
I want my children

01:41:44.375 --> 01:41:45.541
Good evening.

01:41:46.958 --> 01:41:49.416
Turn out the lights before you leave.

01:41:50.375 --> 01:41:51.500
See you tomorrow.

01:42:04.583 --> 01:42:08.625
The office is open from 9 to 5.
We're closing.

01:42:08.708 --> 01:42:09.875
You had an appointment?

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.500
Can I help you?

01:42:12.583 --> 01:42:16.083
Not really,
I'm here to see Señora Pérez.

01:42:18.666 --> 01:42:19.833
Are you Epifanía?

01:42:19.916 --> 01:42:21.875
You're Rita, right?

01:42:26.041 --> 01:42:28.000
-It's done.
-What is?

01:42:28.083 --> 01:42:30.208
We've finally met. About time!

01:42:30.291 --> 01:42:32.833
Come. I'll get my keys.

01:42:34.583 --> 01:42:35.750
Goodnight.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.083
It's me.

01:42:38.166 --> 01:42:39.166
Have a seat.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.625
Can I say you're here?

01:42:42.708 --> 01:42:44.000
Yes.

01:42:44.083 --> 01:42:46.333
Epifanía is here.
We're waiting for you.

01:42:46.416 --> 01:42:47.916
Call back soon.

01:42:53.208 --> 01:42:54.416
She speaks often of you.

01:42:58.041 --> 01:42:59.541
What does she say?

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:03.250
Since she met you,
she's like a teenager.

01:43:03.333 --> 01:43:05.125
A fifteen year old…

01:43:05.208 --> 01:43:06.625
Effusive.

01:43:08.583 --> 01:43:09.666
Glowing.

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:11.958
She often speaks of you.

01:43:13.666 --> 01:43:14.958
What does she say?

01:43:15.041 --> 01:43:17.708
She says you're like her sister.

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:19.833
That you changed her life.

01:43:21.916 --> 01:43:23.333
How did I change her life?

01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:25.791
When? What did she tell you?

01:43:27.791 --> 01:43:30.208
She told me about her family,

01:43:30.291 --> 01:43:33.375
about the children,
the nephews she adores.

01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:36.666
She said she owes this place to you.

01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:38.083
That you made her…

01:43:38.875 --> 01:43:40.083
smarter

01:43:40.166 --> 01:43:41.333
and more generous.

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:43.916
Did I say something wrong?

01:43:44.875 --> 01:43:46.291
Not at all, sorry.

01:43:47.125 --> 01:43:49.291
Emilia is exaggerating as usual,

01:43:49.375 --> 01:43:51.125
but it moves me.

01:43:55.041 --> 01:43:57.125
You and I are her only friends.

01:43:58.041 --> 01:44:00.791
Talk about a fucking fan club!

01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:07.083
It's me, yes.

01:44:09.291 --> 01:44:10.208
What?

01:44:11.291 --> 01:44:12.708
Where?

01:44:12.791 --> 01:44:13.833
You're here?

01:44:15.875 --> 01:44:16.875
Wait a minute.

01:44:29.458 --> 01:44:31.625
We found Ms. Pérez's car.

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:35.708
Her driver is dead.
Ms. Pérez has been kidnapped.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.083
I'm sorry.

01:45:29.791 --> 01:45:31.250
A white shirt

01:45:31.333 --> 01:45:32.958
and a black skirt…

01:45:34.583 --> 01:45:36.000
Ms. Mora Castro?

01:45:36.083 --> 01:45:37.500
Excuse me.

01:46:32.583 --> 01:46:34.041
Emilia!

01:46:34.125 --> 01:46:35.333
No.

01:46:35.416 --> 01:46:36.541
This isn't her.

01:46:37.833 --> 01:46:39.166
Did you get the package?

01:46:40.958 --> 01:46:42.041
Yes.

01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:44.500
You know how to count with fingers?

01:46:46.083 --> 01:46:47.333
30 million.

01:46:48.458 --> 01:46:49.500
Good.

01:46:51.541 --> 01:46:53.458
Put her on so I can hear her.

01:46:57.125 --> 01:46:58.166
Rita.

01:47:00.333 --> 01:47:02.000
Yes, Emilia.

01:47:02.083 --> 01:47:04.000
Do what they ask, okay?

01:47:04.083 --> 01:47:05.833
Of course I will.

01:47:08.791 --> 01:47:10.916
I'm not here by chance.

01:47:15.791 --> 01:47:17.375
Time flew…

01:47:18.666 --> 01:47:20.208
Time flew so fast.

01:47:22.583 --> 01:47:23.708
Bingo.

01:47:25.166 --> 01:47:27.291
That's my line, dummy.

01:47:41.708 --> 01:47:43.333
Come on, come on…

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Ponchis.

01:48:02.333 --> 01:48:04.541
You have to come to La Lucecita.

01:48:05.208 --> 01:48:06.958
Bring 8 or 9 big guys.

01:49:27.958 --> 01:49:29.291
Shit.

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:33.625
Goddammit!

01:49:44.833 --> 01:49:46.833
Continue straight ahead.

01:49:48.166 --> 01:49:49.666
We'll go ahead.

01:49:50.375 --> 01:49:52.458
We'll take the next turn.

01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:54.125
José, turn left.

01:49:54.791 --> 01:49:56.250
Kill the lights.

01:50:24.125 --> 01:50:25.583
What will you do with me?

01:50:25.666 --> 01:50:28.041
Recover the money
you stole from me.

01:50:29.208 --> 01:50:30.041
And then?

01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:32.416
You're nothing to us.

01:50:34.541 --> 01:50:36.000
You'll kill me?

01:50:51.375 --> 01:50:52.375
She's coming.

01:50:53.208 --> 01:50:54.250
Lights off.

01:51:20.208 --> 01:51:21.208
Lights off!

01:51:25.875 --> 01:51:28.000
Turn off your fucking lights!

01:51:35.833 --> 01:51:37.500
Get up and walk.

01:51:45.208 --> 01:51:46.500
Your left hand.

01:51:48.166 --> 01:51:49.708
Let me see Emilia.

01:51:51.208 --> 01:51:52.833
I want to see Emilia!

01:51:53.708 --> 01:51:55.583
Fucking old bitch.

01:51:55.666 --> 01:51:59.208
Show me your fucking left hand, bitch!

01:52:01.708 --> 01:52:03.041
I told you.

01:52:03.125 --> 01:52:06.625
If you don't come out with Emilia,
there's no money!

01:52:06.708 --> 01:52:07.791
You hear me?

01:52:11.041 --> 01:52:13.125
Come out with her!

01:52:13.208 --> 01:52:15.875
Okay, you two come with me.

01:52:15.958 --> 01:52:17.208
You cover us.

01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:18.208
Honey,

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:20.833
get her ready.

01:52:24.458 --> 01:52:26.250
Come.

01:52:28.375 --> 01:52:29.500
Stop moving!

01:52:29.583 --> 01:52:30.583
You hear me?

01:52:30.666 --> 01:52:32.458
No money till I see her!

01:52:33.708 --> 01:52:34.958
Come out with her!

01:52:39.083 --> 01:52:39.958
Fuck!

01:52:40.041 --> 01:52:41.458
She's not alone!

01:53:19.875 --> 01:53:21.041
Emilia!

01:54:19.708 --> 01:54:23.666
I met you when you were 17

01:54:25.208 --> 01:54:27.000
Back then

01:54:27.083 --> 01:54:30.291
I was seeing Julianne, your sister

01:54:30.375 --> 01:54:32.125
What are you saying?

01:54:33.583 --> 01:54:36.125
When I was with Julianne

01:54:36.708 --> 01:54:39.208
It was you I'd stare at

01:54:39.291 --> 01:54:41.916
Then one day in the Azucena

01:54:42.666 --> 01:54:44.500
I kissed you

01:54:45.333 --> 01:54:48.833
And we went upstairs to do the rest

01:54:48.916 --> 01:54:51.125
You kissed me?

01:54:51.208 --> 01:54:54.833
We went upstairs to do the rest

01:54:55.958 --> 01:54:57.500
Who told you this?

01:54:57.583 --> 01:55:00.750
When we wed
I gave you two necklaces

01:55:00.833 --> 01:55:02.666
You told me…

01:55:04.333 --> 01:55:05.625
Quiet

01:55:06.208 --> 01:55:08.750
You told me you'd lost one

01:55:08.833 --> 01:55:11.708
But I knew you gave it away

01:55:12.291 --> 01:55:15.000
To Julianne so she'd forgive you

01:55:15.083 --> 01:55:16.875
On the day of the wedding

01:55:16.958 --> 01:55:21.583
You were so ashamed of your family

01:55:24.375 --> 01:55:26.166
You didn't want to see them

01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:30.458
So you put them
In the back of the church

01:55:33.083 --> 01:55:35.333
Who are you?

01:55:35.416 --> 01:55:37.541
Who are you?

01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:40.083
Emilia

01:55:40.166 --> 01:55:42.416
Manitas

01:55:43.541 --> 01:55:47.958
My God, what have we done?

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:49.750
Jessica

01:55:51.708 --> 01:55:53.583
Forgive me

01:55:56.208 --> 01:55:59.583
Forgive me

01:56:00.958 --> 01:56:04.125
Forgive me

01:56:45.833 --> 01:56:47.166
Jessica.

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.041
Get in the car!

01:56:51.125 --> 01:56:52.583
What are we doing?

01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:54.166
Get in!

01:56:55.583 --> 01:56:57.333
Get in the fucking car!

01:57:03.875 --> 01:57:06.208
Goddamn motherfuckers!

01:57:08.333 --> 01:57:09.333
Stop!

01:57:10.291 --> 01:57:11.708
-What?
-Stop!

01:57:12.333 --> 01:57:13.875
What's your problem?

01:57:13.958 --> 01:57:15.291
Stop the car!

01:57:16.333 --> 01:57:18.750
Get off me, you lunatic!

01:57:18.833 --> 01:57:20.583
You're fucking crazy!

01:57:22.083 --> 01:57:23.708
What's your problem?

01:57:32.791 --> 01:57:34.750
He's in the trunk.

01:57:35.458 --> 01:57:36.583
Manitas.

01:57:37.833 --> 01:57:39.500
He's in the trunk.

01:57:39.583 --> 01:57:40.583
My husband!

01:57:40.666 --> 01:57:42.250
-What?
-In the trunk!

01:57:43.833 --> 01:57:45.166
Stop the car!

01:57:47.416 --> 01:57:49.875
Careful with that.

01:57:49.958 --> 01:57:51.666
Careful with that thing.

01:57:52.291 --> 01:57:54.666
-Watch out.
-Stop the car!

01:57:55.333 --> 01:57:57.125
What are you doing, Jessi?

01:57:58.083 --> 01:57:59.125
Please!

01:57:59.916 --> 01:58:01.041
Calm down.

01:58:01.125 --> 01:58:02.708
I'll pull over.

01:58:02.791 --> 01:58:04.500
Relax.

01:58:04.583 --> 01:58:05.583
Calm down.

01:59:18.666 --> 01:59:19.833
Madam Rita.

01:59:20.416 --> 01:59:21.416
They're coming.

01:59:41.791 --> 01:59:44.625
Your mother had a car accident.

01:59:44.708 --> 01:59:46.416
She won't be coming home.

01:59:52.833 --> 01:59:54.958
Now I'll take care of you.

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:10.416
I dedicate this poem

02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:14.375
To the beloved, so loved

02:00:14.458 --> 02:00:21.458
For a fleeting instant

02:00:23.375 --> 02:00:28.333
To the woman of my nights

02:00:28.416 --> 02:00:32.708
The one who left at dawn

02:00:32.791 --> 02:00:39.541
Never speaking about herself

02:00:41.708 --> 02:00:46.041
To she who drank from my fountains

02:00:46.125 --> 02:00:50.541
Whose mystery I miss

02:00:50.625 --> 02:00:57.416
Like a distant star

02:00:59.458 --> 02:01:03.625
To she who let me be free

02:01:03.708 --> 02:01:07.833
Free like the air

02:01:07.916 --> 02:01:14.166
Free like her scent

02:01:15.333 --> 02:01:19.041
To she who in a spark

02:01:19.125 --> 02:01:22.666
Her arms wide open

02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:28.166
Crossed our path

02:01:30.041 --> 02:01:33.375
To she who worked the miracle

02:01:33.458 --> 02:01:37.041
Of changing lead to gold

02:01:37.125 --> 02:01:42.500
And enchanted the world

02:01:44.333 --> 02:01:47.791
To she who hoisted beside us

02:01:47.875 --> 02:01:51.083
For the cause of the damned

02:01:51.166 --> 02:01:56.583
The flag of Truth

02:01:58.541 --> 02:02:02.166
To she whose fiery countenance

02:02:02.250 --> 02:02:05.708
With her marvelous grace

02:02:05.791 --> 02:02:10.458
Filled us with Happiness

02:02:20.083 --> 02:02:23.500
To she who will never come back

02:02:23.583 --> 02:02:27.125
To she who kept her secret

02:02:27.208 --> 02:02:33.750
I offer these flowers

02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:14.500
