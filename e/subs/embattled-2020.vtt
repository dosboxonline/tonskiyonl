M_I_SForEver

01:03.915 --> 01:05.415
Yes, yes.

01:05.449 --> 01:06.451
Hey, Chief.

01:07.585 --> 01:08.887
I'm not sure this is the right
time.

01:09.888 --> 01:11.556
Fuck that. They know me, Sport.

01:11.589 --> 01:13.892
Any chance your nine-inch claim
is a bit of an overstatement.

01:13.925 --> 01:15.025
What?

01:15.058 --> 01:17.462
Are you some authority
on my cock now?

01:18.028 --> 01:20.230
I've seen that. I'm not sure
that makes me an authority.

01:20.264 --> 01:22.000
When? After our workout.

01:22.032 --> 01:23.601
Yes.

01:23.635 --> 01:25.035
Well, it's not nine inches after
I peel off my bone handles.

01:25.068 --> 01:26.103
Even still.

01:26.136 --> 01:27.539
Even still what, shit bird?

01:27.572 --> 01:29.072
The physics just don't equate.

01:31.074 --> 01:33.011
You think a woman of Jade's caliber
was going to settle for six inches?

01:33.043 --> 01:35.947
Look, all I'm saying
is you are not nine.

01:36.948 --> 01:37.982
Fine, eight.

01:39.149 --> 01:40.417
If you think I'm
dropping down to seven,

01:40.451 --> 01:42.085
you need to go see
a motherfucking optometrist.

01:43.655 --> 01:46.323
The is dropping in 30 seconds, people.
Who wants him?

01:46.624 --> 01:48.058
Fuck, yes.

01:48.091 --> 01:49.594
You know what time it is.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.579
I love my baby so much.

02:07.612 --> 02:08.947
I love you too, sweetheart.

02:12.951 --> 02:15.185
Your time is now. Instagram.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.823
I finally get to kill
myself a commie.

02:19.189 --> 02:20.959
Lock and load, motherfuckers.

02:23.427 --> 02:24.161
I love you.

02:24.194 --> 02:26.096
I love you too. Get him.

02:38.977 --> 02:44.147
After all the talk, all the insults,
World War III is finally erupting.

02:44.181 --> 02:46.050
Tyron, USA versus Russia.

02:46.551 --> 02:47.986
We've broken this fight down.

02:48.019 --> 02:50.455
Stylistic,
literally down to a molecule.

02:50.488 --> 02:52.857
These guys cannot stand each
other.

02:52.890 --> 02:55.192
It's going to make
for a spectacular match up.

02:55.225 --> 02:56.628
It could be an instant classic.

03:02.834 --> 03:05.603
Cash is in the cage.
The crowd is on its feet.

03:05.637 --> 03:08.238
Let's through it to the ring
announcer, Richie Simmons.

03:08.873 --> 03:10.207
Come on.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.310
Now, for the fight
we've all been waiting for.

03:14.012 --> 03:17.782
From the sold-out
MGM Grand in beautiful

03:17.815 --> 03:24.722
Las Vegas, Nevada,
it's time, for damage.

03:26.156 --> 03:28.693
In the blue corner,
fighting out of st.

03:28.726 --> 03:33.831
Petersburg, Russia,
standing five foot 8 inches,

03:33.865 --> 03:37.702
weighing 170 pounds with

03:37.735 --> 03:41.906
an impressive of 18 wins,
four losses,

03:41.939 --> 03:47.078
the world's number one
welterweight contender, Timothy

03:47.545 --> 03:53.250
'the Terrible' Koslov.

03:54.552 --> 03:57.922
In the red corner,
standing five foot

03:57.955 --> 04:02.160
nine inches, weighing 171
pounds,

04:02.192 --> 04:05.730
fighting out of Birmingham,
Alabama.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.935
With a record of 37 wins,
one defeat,

04:11.268 --> 04:14.404
the undisputed Lightweight
Champion of the world,

04:14.438 --> 04:19.543
the undisputed Welterweight
Champion of the world, the Slayer,

04:21.745 --> 04:24.882
Lukewood Cash.

04:30.722 --> 04:35.460
All right, gentlemen, bring it in.
Bring it in, guys. Let's go.

04:35.793 --> 04:37.729
Gentlemen, you've both received
your shots in the locker room.

04:37.762 --> 04:40.198
You all know the rules.
If you want to touch gloves, do so now.

04:40.230 --> 04:42.567
You can't just commie fuck
with nerve of agents fight?

04:42.600 --> 04:43.801
It's 1:00 AM on the east coast.

04:43.835 --> 04:45.268
Cash, do you want
to get this thing started?

04:45.302 --> 04:48.106
This election-meddling
son of a bitch won't take long.

04:48.139 --> 04:49.239
America, suck dick.

04:52.810 --> 04:56.147
Get back to your corners.
All right, let's go. Let's do this now.

04:56.981 --> 04:59.650
Blue corner, are you ready?
Red corner, are you ready?

04:59.684 --> 05:00.585
Fuck, yes.

05:00.618 --> 05:02.086
Let's go.

05:11.328 --> 05:13.831
Come on.

05:30.548 --> 05:33.283
Yes, yes.

05:42.359 --> 05:47.865
That's it, fight's over.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.971
Roses are red, violets are
blue.

05:55.239 --> 05:59.644
I'm feeling pretty tits right now
but sure could really use a blow job.

06:00.645 --> 06:01.679
That almost rhymed.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.215
Eat your heart out,
Emily Dickinson.

06:04.248 --> 06:05.616
Yes sir, baby.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.151
Cash, you are not posting that.

06:07.552 --> 06:08.553
Never baby.

06:13.323 --> 06:17.360
Oh, yum, yum, yum, yum,
drink looks tasty too.

06:19.396 --> 06:20.865
If that's all right, sweetheart.
Please do not encourage that, Jeez.

06:20.898 --> 06:22.300
Its called humor, darling.

06:22.332 --> 06:23.400
Not where I come from.

06:23.433 --> 06:25.069
Oh, burn.

06:26.336 --> 06:28.005
Isn't my son a face God, Dazz.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.173
Here we go.

06:29.207 --> 06:30.340
I mean it's hard
to believe with that

06:30.373 --> 06:33.044
faggoty hair and those
pretty-boy looks.

06:33.376 --> 06:36.214
Chief here slipped one
past the goalie back in college.

06:36.247 --> 06:39.116
Sport was the youngest
ever to make the US judo team.

06:39.449 --> 06:42.186
Can you please shut the hell
up and just drink your drink.

06:42.220 --> 06:44.421
Deserey, we'll let you know
if we need anything else.

06:44.455 --> 06:46.090
No problem. Just let me know.

06:46.123 --> 06:47.124
Thank you.

06:52.029 --> 06:53.297
Are you fucking blind.

06:53.865 --> 06:56.234
She's tighter than
a seven-year-old Korean boy.

06:56.267 --> 06:58.002
Enough with the damn Olympic
card.

06:58.035 --> 07:01.038
Since when did throwing
out a resume for a tasty

07:01.072 --> 07:03.474
piece of hair pie
become a goddamn crime.

07:03.875 --> 07:06.611
Have a beer with me,
jack her back to the mansion.

07:06.944 --> 07:08.411
No mansion jacking.

07:08.813 --> 07:10.481
I've got a calculus test
tomorrow.

07:10.882 --> 07:12.216
Fuck arithmetic.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.618
Well, you need to know
mom's going to breathalyze

07:13.651 --> 07:15.219
my ass right when I get home
too.

07:16.254 --> 07:17.855
Goddamn whack job she is.

07:17.889 --> 07:20.491
Hey, dillweed she might be
your ex but she's my mom.

07:21.292 --> 07:22.392
Way to go, Jetty.

07:22.894 --> 07:24.095
Apologies, Sport.

07:25.630 --> 07:27.765
How is Miss Looney
Tunes doing anyway?

07:28.332 --> 07:30.635
She's still on match.com.

07:33.337 --> 07:35.573
No, threw in the towel last
month.

07:36.474 --> 07:38.910
What about Tard? How's he?

07:39.911 --> 07:42.980
Come on, can you please not
call him that for me, please.

07:43.514 --> 07:44.582
Fine, pussy hole.

07:49.687 --> 07:51.389
Don't you ever stop?

07:51.421 --> 07:55.660
Yes.
About 10 seconds before I puke.

07:57.194 --> 07:59.864
How is Timofey 'The Terrible'
feeling right about now.

08:00.865 --> 08:02.266
About $3 million richer.

08:02.800 --> 08:03.801
You?

08:05.202 --> 08:07.305
I made a million bucks
per second last night, Sport.

08:08.472 --> 08:10.942
Crap. This is me right
here on the left.

08:15.379 --> 08:16.347
Love you, Jade.

08:16.380 --> 08:17.515
You too, Jetty.

08:18.382 --> 08:20.351
You got Kareef tomorrow at 3:00
PM.

08:20.384 --> 08:23.354
I'll be there.
Thanks for including me.

08:23.387 --> 08:25.890
Always, Sport, it's fun.

08:28.326 --> 08:29.193
Fucker.

08:29.226 --> 08:30.127
Hey.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.195
Too slow pussy hole.

08:31.529 --> 08:32.530
This is mine, fucker.

10:32.650 --> 10:34.585
I'm going to need you to help
me out this afternoon, Jett.

10:34.618 --> 10:36.253
Well I've got Kareef at 3:00
PM, Mom.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.490
Just take his Xbox with you and
stick him in Patty's office.

10:38.523 --> 10:39.623
Patty is busy, Mom.

10:39.957 --> 10:41.892
No she's not, trust me.

10:41.926 --> 10:44.463
I don't want to go to the gym.
He called me a tard.

10:44.496 --> 10:45.996
I talked to him, that's done,
okay?

10:46.030 --> 10:47.331
I want to play with Patrick.

10:47.364 --> 10:48.332
No chance, baby.

10:48.365 --> 10:49.266
But I want to.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.668
Today's no good, Q.

10:50.701 --> 10:52.471
Can you get him his meds
and finish up everything?

10:52.504 --> 10:54.105
I got a client at 7:45.

10:54.138 --> 10:55.574
Yes, go.

10:55.606 --> 10:56.674
Just don't forget your lunches,
okay? I love you guys.

10:56.707 --> 11:00.678
Yes, I love you too. Here you
go.

11:10.489 --> 11:11.490
Swallow.

11:15.693 --> 11:19.697
Open. Good man.
Hey, when you're finished?

11:19.730 --> 11:22.534
Plate in the sink, brush your
teeth, and get dressed, okay?

11:22.567 --> 11:23.568
Okay.

11:26.538 --> 11:29.173
Hey, Jett. Hey Jett.

11:29.206 --> 11:30.341
Yes?

11:30.374 --> 11:31.976
Will there always
be toys in the world?

11:32.643 --> 11:34.044
Look I've got a huge test.

11:34.078 --> 11:35.880
Just tell me yes or no
and I'll promise I'll stop.

11:35.913 --> 11:37.549
Yes, there will always be toys.

11:40.384 --> 11:41.385
Forever?

11:44.556 --> 11:46.558
Yes.

11:49.528 --> 11:50.995
Ace, what's up, bro?

11:51.028 --> 11:54.165
All good man. You good?
Catch you, boys, later.

11:54.198 --> 11:54.965
Alright.

11:54.999 --> 11:56.367
Yo Q.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.067
Hey, how you doing, man?

11:57.101 --> 11:58.402
Looking handsome, dog.

11:58.435 --> 11:59.336
Thanks, bro.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.070
Feel good, boss.

12:00.104 --> 12:02.406
My man.

12:03.007 --> 12:05.976
Hey, your dad is filthy, man,
that's the only way to describe it.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.978
Dude, where you there when he
made it rain at Olympic Gardens?

12:08.012 --> 12:08.913
How did you guys see that?

12:08.946 --> 12:10.582
Excuse me, I have a question,

12:10.615 --> 12:13.450
do you guys ever stick out
your tongues at each other?

12:15.453 --> 12:16.588
Quinn.

12:21.593 --> 12:28.232
Quinn, did you know Fat Lexy
have big, giant lovely boobies?

12:30.868 --> 12:32.770
Patrick, come on now.

12:32.803 --> 12:34.238
It's funny, Mr. Stewart.

12:34.271 --> 12:35.439
No, it's not funny.

12:35.473 --> 12:37.074
Your dad is the shit.

12:37.107 --> 12:39.743
Okay Jerry. Come on man, what's
up? You want detention?

12:40.612 --> 12:41.779
No sir.

12:41.812 --> 12:43.582
No, that language
doesn't fly in my class.

12:44.281 --> 12:47.418
Make it quick, Jett.
Tongue fixation.

12:47.718 --> 12:49.420
No it's not tongue fixation.

12:49.454 --> 12:51.623
Jet what the heck is wrong with
you.

12:51.656 --> 12:54.425
Okay, everybody,
calm down, all right.

12:54.459 --> 12:55.726
Thanks for the heads up.

14:04.529 --> 14:05.664
Thanks, Jett.

14:17.174 --> 14:18.510
Improper integrals, huh?

14:18.876 --> 14:20.478
Can you get lower than an F?

14:20.911 --> 14:22.813
Seriously when she hands
back our tests mine's

14:22.846 --> 14:25.349
going to have a big red
G written across the top.

14:25.717 --> 14:26.718
No.

14:28.753 --> 14:30.522
Hope this fighting thing works
out.

14:35.092 --> 14:39.863
Nice baby, nice. You hit that
hammer. Again. Good, good.

14:40.732 --> 14:46.370
Now, don't get lazy, come on.
Move together. QUick and fast. Let's go.

14:46.403 --> 14:51.375
There you go. Move, move, move.
Go.

14:51.408 --> 14:53.277
Vaughn's Fight Academy,
this is Patty.

14:55.780 --> 14:56.781
Paid for this suit too.

14:58.849 --> 14:59.850
Jamie's on two.

15:00.918 --> 15:02.386
How's Quinn holding up in
there?

15:02.419 --> 15:06.190
Other than asking me if he can
watch Pornhub, splendidly.

15:07.024 --> 15:09.193
Jesus. All right.

15:11.596 --> 15:14.766
Jamie, you shaved that
hideous fucking beard off yet.

15:14.799 --> 15:15.800
Fuck you, Cash.

15:17.769 --> 15:20.772
I'm sitting here with my attorney
Mr. Adelsberg, aka the Jew assassin.

15:21.606 --> 15:23.775
He's just informed me
that you and Rami once

15:23.808 --> 15:26.043
again are giving
it to me up the dirt shoe.

15:26.578 --> 15:28.345
Shocking.

15:28.379 --> 15:32.249
The gate, merchandise, pay per
view, foreign PPV all the way down.

15:32.817 --> 15:34.952
Your numbers in Russia
alone aren't even close.

15:37.988 --> 15:39.791
Yes, all right.

15:39.824 --> 15:42.827
I'll get into it with Rami and
I'll get back to you fellows. Okay?

15:44.962 --> 15:46.296
What does that even mean?

15:46.330 --> 15:47.665
They're worse than Putin.

15:48.666 --> 15:51.569
Yes, but they can be defeated.

15:53.904 --> 15:57.842
Three, two, one. Good, twist.

16:08.152 --> 16:09.953
Is this Colbie fucking Caillat.

16:10.855 --> 16:12.122
Caillat.

16:12.156 --> 16:14.793
Holy fuck,
my son's a turd burglar, fellas.

16:15.926 --> 16:17.896
How do you expect to issue
a beat down when you're

16:17.928 --> 16:20.964
listening to all that West
Hollywood Meryl Streep bullshit.

16:20.998 --> 16:21.766
Colbie's hot Chief.

16:23.701 --> 16:28.673
Her, Taylor, and Selena, and they do
more for charity than you ever will.

16:28.706 --> 16:32.009
I give millions to charity,
dickface, it's called taxes.

16:33.043 --> 16:38.315
We got to hook you up.
System of a Down, Death Tone, Rob Zombie.

16:39.884 --> 16:41.853
I love my girls, deal with it.

16:43.488 --> 16:45.989
If you say so, Sport?
Are you ready to deal with me?

16:46.390 --> 16:49.993
No, not a chance.
I can't even lift my arms.

16:50.027 --> 16:53.063
Hey, I'm wearing skinny jeans,
buddy. We're even.

16:53.531 --> 16:54.632
Get the fuck up here.

17:06.143 --> 17:08.847
You don't need that pussy headgear.
Come on.

17:13.550 --> 17:19.223
Come on, pussy. Judo fag mama's
boy.

17:32.770 --> 17:35.640
Oh, shit. We've got a bleeder
here.

17:35.673 --> 17:36.908
Cash.

17:37.374 --> 17:39.076
Hey, Insta, what's up?

17:39.109 --> 17:41.445
Yes, I'm back from Vegas
with my boy Jett here,

17:41.746 --> 17:46.383
about to be arrested for child abuse.
Come on, Sport.

17:50.955 --> 17:51.956
That's right.

17:53.190 --> 17:53.925
Come on Jett, get fisted, baby.
Get fisted.

17:53.958 --> 17:55.760
Take three,

17:55.793 --> 17:58.262
maybe put on some of that Call Me
Maybe shit it'll wake his ass up.

18:01.733 --> 18:02.867
Holy crap.

18:03.601 --> 18:04.903
Finish him, what you doing?

18:04.936 --> 18:05.937
This is fucking stupid.

18:07.772 --> 18:09.273
You hit me in the fucking face,
huh?

18:09.306 --> 18:14.913
Fuck off. Fuck off.
Fuck off. Fuck. I tap.

18:14.946 --> 18:16.079
How's that feel?

18:16.113 --> 18:17.281
Fuck off.

18:17.314 --> 18:21.786
Yo, Patty, you delete that shit.
Now.

18:21.819 --> 18:24.923
I'm deleting. Jesus.

18:33.998 --> 18:36.935
Hey, Quinn, go to bed.

18:36.968 --> 18:37.936
Am I good?

18:37.969 --> 18:39.904
Yes, solid, Q.

18:39.938 --> 18:42.139
Keep practicing you can be in a real
band soon slay babes left and right.

18:42.172 --> 18:42.807
Now got to bed.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.408
Slay babe.

18:47.645 --> 18:48.646
Hey, Jett.

18:49.146 --> 18:50.447
What?

18:50.481 --> 18:52.416
I have a question.
Do some girls have wieners?

18:53.751 --> 18:55.152
Where'd you hear that?

18:55.185 --> 18:56.420
I saw it on benaughty.com.

18:56.454 --> 18:58.623
Are you visiting those sites
again?

19:00.858 --> 19:02.159
Do you want mom to kill you?

19:03.126 --> 19:04.428
I won't do it again. I promise.

19:04.462 --> 19:06.096
Well, you do it again
and I'm telling her.

19:06.129 --> 19:07.498
Because it's weird, right?

19:07.532 --> 19:09.767
Yes. Very.
Now look, it's 10:20 go to sleep.

19:11.435 --> 19:13.270
Oh wait, did I have melatonin?

19:14.973 --> 19:15.807
Yes.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.975
Can you have mom peek on me?

19:17.809 --> 19:18.943
Yes.

19:20.044 --> 19:21.111
You promise?

19:21.546 --> 19:22.647
Yes.

19:23.447 --> 19:25.083
Okay, love you, Jett.

19:25.115 --> 19:26.017
Love you too.

19:26.050 --> 19:29.520
More than yourself? Say it.

19:29.554 --> 19:31.990
More than myself. Now go to
sleep.

19:41.065 --> 19:42.165
Hey.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.902
Hey.

19:46.838 --> 19:48.006
Not again mom.

19:48.873 --> 19:51.009
Made $200 in four hours.

19:51.042 --> 19:53.711
It's twice what I make at Pro
Sport.

19:55.880 --> 19:56.648
Where?

19:56.681 --> 19:57.682
The Yard.

19:57.715 --> 19:59.249
Mom, everyone we know goes
there.

20:00.718 --> 20:02.053
Don't give me that look.

20:03.855 --> 20:08.059
Physical therapists at 41 is great
but waitress at 41 is pathetic.

20:09.861 --> 20:12.063
Providing for my boys is
pathetic?

20:19.037 --> 20:20.038
How many nights a week?

20:21.338 --> 20:23.074
No ballpark. Three, four?

20:23.107 --> 20:24.142
Yes.

20:24.174 --> 20:25.342
Four nights a week, I have
Quinn?

20:27.078 --> 20:28.513
He's making millions.

20:29.947 --> 20:31.582
You want to ask him for more
money?

20:31.616 --> 20:33.051
Because I'm not doing that.

20:42.627 --> 20:45.362
I fought that son of a bitch
in court for 10 years.

20:46.097 --> 20:50.267
All the while, he never gave me
a dime for Quinn's heart surgery,

20:50.300 --> 20:52.202
never a dime
for his stomach surgery.

20:54.138 --> 20:56.107
I know he's back in your life,

20:56.741 --> 21:00.144
and I know he's helping you follow
your dreams, so I keep quiet,

21:01.979 --> 21:04.082
but it's real goddamn hard,
Jett.

21:23.134 --> 21:24.168
Got you good today?

21:25.503 --> 21:29.774
Yes, I do. That was only
the second time in what?

21:30.808 --> 21:34.344
22 years of fighting that
I got caught by a roundhouse.

21:35.580 --> 21:38.549
Yes? When was the first?

21:38.583 --> 21:41.152
10 years ago, Claude.

21:42.352 --> 21:44.222
Is that the only time
you ever lost a fight?

21:44.254 --> 21:46.791
In my life? Fuck, no.

21:48.192 --> 21:50.128
Birmingham's 75% black.

21:50.795 --> 21:53.430
Homies went Reginald
Denny on my ass hourly.

21:56.167 --> 21:59.203
Hey, I got a nice
surprise for you tomorrow.

22:00.337 --> 22:01.105
Don't be late.

22:01.639 --> 22:03.340
What is it?

22:15.186 --> 22:18.122
Then we multiply
all of this by delta X,

22:18.156 --> 22:21.291
which is two over N, and this is
going to be the setup for rewriting

22:21.324 --> 22:23.161
our definite integral
using Riemann sum.

22:23.194 --> 22:25.696
Have a good after
day, everyone.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.201
How did you do?

22:32.369 --> 22:33.137
Oh, sorry.

22:33.171 --> 22:33.971
It's not your fault.

22:37.241 --> 22:41.179
Bye, good job. See you. Good
job.

22:41.212 --> 22:44.081
Great work. Good job. Great
work.

22:44.414 --> 22:45.850
Yes, well, wish me luck.

22:46.383 --> 22:48.186
What are you doing after
school?

22:48.219 --> 22:49.253
Ms. Malek.

22:49.654 --> 22:50.655
Hello, Jett.

22:51.388 --> 22:52.857
Is there anything I can do?

22:53.858 --> 22:56.093
Yes, you can avoid Las Vegas.

22:56.426 --> 22:57.795
That trip was planned.

22:57.829 --> 22:59.230
You've known about
this test for a month, Jett.

22:59.263 --> 23:01.265
Oh,
what if I did some extra credit?

23:03.601 --> 23:05.670
I think it runs a little
deeper than that.

23:06.237 --> 23:07.370
That 41 was generous.

23:12.009 --> 23:14.846
Look, you missed a lot
of important stuff last year.

23:16.346 --> 23:17.347
What about a tutor?

23:18.716 --> 23:19.984
If I don't pass your class,
I don't graduate.

23:20.017 --> 23:21.185
Just $25 an hour.

23:23.588 --> 23:24.589
Whatever it takes.

24:15.907 --> 24:16.908
Yo, Chief.

24:19.143 --> 24:20.144
You ready?

24:21.312 --> 24:22.313
Yes.

24:32.089 --> 24:33.691
Meet your sparring partner?

24:36.761 --> 24:38.763
You want me to spar
Enrique Castaneda?

24:39.429 --> 24:41.465
Number three
welterweight in the world.

24:41.499 --> 24:42.600
We got to fix your jab.

24:48.973 --> 24:51.441
Excuse me. Are you okay?

24:52.510 --> 24:53.277
Are you sure?

24:54.211 --> 24:56.347
Yes. I'm fine, ma'am.

24:56.380 --> 24:59.317
I appreciate your concern though.
Thank you.

25:02.353 --> 25:03.754
Okay. Hey, y'all.

25:06.691 --> 25:08.092
Quinn, look towards me, please.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.026
I'm watching the game.

25:09.060 --> 25:10.528
There's no TV in here, Quinn.

25:10.561 --> 25:12.430
Just shut up and look towards
me.

25:12.463 --> 25:14.365
Finish your hamburger. Now.

25:26.911 --> 25:29.513
I'm going to go watch the game.

25:29.547 --> 25:31.315
Hi.
Yes, is this Johnny?

25:32.483 --> 25:36.387
My name is Jett Boykins.
I am a senior at Ramsey High.

25:38.055 --> 25:39.323
Hi.

25:39.357 --> 25:40.459
Hello.

25:40.491 --> 25:42.560
My name is Quinn. What's your
name?

25:42.593 --> 25:45.029
I was referred to you by Ms.
Malek.

25:46.430 --> 25:47.531
I have a question.

25:47.565 --> 25:49.033
Yes?

25:49.066 --> 25:51.569
Do you like every shake out
your tongues at each other?

25:51.602 --> 25:54.572
Yes, that works perfectly.

25:54.605 --> 25:56.407
Thank you and I'll talk to you.
Bye.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.142
So did you want to see it?

25:58.175 --> 25:59.844
We're sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Start walking, Quinn.

25:59.877 --> 26:01.245
Hey, stop pushing me.

26:01.278 --> 26:02.413
What happened to your face?

26:02.446 --> 26:03.482
I got my butt kicked.

26:03.514 --> 26:04.048
Stop.

26:04.081 --> 26:05.082
Shut up.

26:07.451 --> 26:08.453
Get in the car.

26:13.557 --> 26:15.059
What is your freaking problem,
Jett?

26:15.092 --> 26:17.094
It's all just so weird and
disturbing okay?

26:17.428 --> 26:19.764
I can't take it any fucking
more.

26:19.797 --> 26:21.500
Well, I have bullied syndrome.

26:21.532 --> 26:22.400
Don't give me that bullshit.

26:22.433 --> 26:23.567
It's my fault.

26:23.601 --> 26:24.435
Yes, whose fault is it then?

26:24.469 --> 26:25.603
You're such a jerk.

26:25.636 --> 26:27.204
Ow.

26:35.046 --> 26:36.080
I hate you.

26:36.113 --> 26:37.114
I hate you back.

26:40.317 --> 26:41.419
That hurt.

26:45.923 --> 26:46.924
Hey, Jett,

26:50.127 --> 26:51.796
care to listen to Christmas
music?

26:57.502 --> 26:59.970
You would have been
so proud of Kingston today.

27:00.004 --> 27:03.542
Mr. Tanaka moves him up
from an orange belt to a green.

27:03.574 --> 27:05.576
Hold on. He skipped blue?

27:05.609 --> 27:07.479
He number one for his age.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.948
Little fucking stud.

27:11.615 --> 27:12.683
I love you.

27:13.518 --> 27:19.423
I love you too, baby. What?

27:19.458 --> 27:20.459
What's wrong?

27:21.759 --> 27:23.360
I think I'm going to be sick.

27:23.627 --> 27:24.728
We should go.

27:24.762 --> 27:25.996
I just ordered the bone-in.

27:26.030 --> 27:28.632
I know.
I'll order you whatever you want.

27:28.666 --> 27:30.469
Please, I'm going to throw up.
Okay.

27:30.935 --> 27:33.304
All right. All right.

27:43.948 --> 27:45.316
Shit.

27:50.688 --> 27:53.492
You sexy little minx.

27:56.894 --> 27:58.395
Fuck, you're so beautiful.

28:01.799 --> 28:03.667
You're so fucking beautiful.

28:03.701 --> 28:05.669
I love you.

28:05.703 --> 28:08.172
I love you.

28:12.409 --> 28:13.644
Fuck.

28:14.912 --> 28:16.113
Hey.

28:16.147 --> 28:17.181
Yes, what's up?

28:17.214 --> 28:19.083
Can we just talk for a second,
please?

28:19.551 --> 28:21.685
Didn't we already
talk enough at dinner?

28:23.588 --> 28:24.989
Let's see.

28:26.657 --> 28:31.896
Kingston's kicking ass in karate
and you want a bodyguard, right?

28:32.897 --> 28:33.898
It's about Susan.

28:35.232 --> 28:39.436
I just went limp. Thanks. Fuck.

28:43.908 --> 28:45.376
Listen.

28:45.409 --> 28:47.546
I know you insist on keeping
her stuff separate from me.

28:47.579 --> 28:50.549
I don't insist on anything.
We have a contract, remember?

28:50.582 --> 28:53.217
Okay, well, I'm sorry to tell
you this but I'm your wife.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.752
I'm going to have
an opinion or two on certain

28:54.785 --> 28:59.323
topics which means you are
required to listen to me. Okay?

28:59.356 --> 29:00.724
Okay. Go.

29:04.028 --> 29:05.196
Cash, they need money.

29:06.263 --> 29:07.932
Where is this shit coming from,
babe?

29:07.965 --> 29:10.434
I've been thinking about this
shit for the past nine years.

29:10.468 --> 29:11.769
We never help with Quinn.

29:11.802 --> 29:13.370
He's not your son, Jade.

29:13.404 --> 29:16.575
No, he's not.
He's your son but that doesn't mean

29:16.608 --> 29:18.709
I'm not allowed to help care for
him, does it?

29:18.742 --> 29:21.580
Fine. Take him for an
afternoon.

29:21.613 --> 29:24.215
Have Kingston play with him.
Great, but that's it.

29:24.248 --> 29:27.686
Why? Why, Cash?
Why can't we just love him?

29:27.718 --> 29:29.353
Love him like we love Kingston?

29:29.386 --> 29:31.355
Because he won't love us back.

29:31.388 --> 29:34.258
My god. Of course, he will.
Why do you say that?

29:34.291 --> 29:35.594
Why do you even think that?

29:35.627 --> 29:37.428
Because she lied to them about
me.

29:37.462 --> 29:38.630
Cash, you hit her.

29:38.663 --> 29:40.665
Yes, after she attacked me,
honey.

29:41.298 --> 29:43.801
I had to wait two years
before I could even see them.

29:44.168 --> 29:48.640
No, she lied to the cops.
She lied on the stand. Fuck her.

29:48.673 --> 29:50.441
She gets what she gets
and she shouldn't

29:50.475 --> 29:51.643
be throwing a fucking fit about
it.

29:51.676 --> 29:54.144
Because of her,
they have to suffer?

29:54.178 --> 30:00.084
Suffer? No, they learn.
Hard work, adversity, struggle.

30:00.117 --> 30:01.653
That's how winners are made,

30:01.686 --> 30:03.787
not cuddling Kingston
around like a fucking...

30:03.821 --> 30:05.256
No, no, no don't you
fucking do that shit.

30:05.289 --> 30:06.625
Don't fucking start with me,
Cash.

30:06.658 --> 30:09.393
I took fights for 2000.
I worked two jobs.

30:09.426 --> 30:10.761
I had two little kids.

30:10.794 --> 30:13.097
We were this close to
being homeless, baby.

30:13.130 --> 30:15.232
My old man didn't give me jack
shit.

30:15.266 --> 30:18.002
Your old man was an abusive drunk
who didn't have jackshit to give you.

30:18.035 --> 30:23.207
If I give money to Susan, she gives
money to Jett and that can't happen.

30:23.874 --> 30:26.844
We have four houses and nine
cars.

30:26.877 --> 30:28.245
I'm done talking about this.

30:28.279 --> 30:30.314
Four houses and nine cars,
Cash.

30:30.347 --> 30:31.750
Jade, fuck you.

30:31.782 --> 30:33.752
Fuck you, get the fuck out of
here.

30:33.784 --> 30:35.487
Yes, I will you fucking cunt.

30:41.726 --> 30:42.527
Hi.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.561
Hey.

30:46.363 --> 30:47.699
Did Quinn go to bed okay?

30:47.732 --> 30:49.233
Yes.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.148
I'm a terrible mother.

31:04.181 --> 31:04.948
Mom.

31:04.982 --> 31:06.250
How do I allow my child?

31:06.718 --> 31:08.018
This is who I am.

31:09.688 --> 31:11.790
Fighting isn't who you are,
it's what you do.

31:11.822 --> 31:13.692
Clearly I fucking suck at it.

31:16.695 --> 31:18.329
Bud, what happened?

31:19.731 --> 31:21.832
I got my ass fed to me, Mom.

31:26.070 --> 31:30.709
No, with Q.

31:35.913 --> 31:37.549
I just wish I had someone else,

31:38.750 --> 31:43.588
someone to share with
because it never stops.

31:44.121 --> 31:45.956
I always feel like a failure.

31:51.796 --> 31:56.400
I ask a lot of you,
it's not fair, it's not.

32:03.907 --> 32:08.780
Did I ever tell you about my first
Williams Syndrome convention?

32:10.782 --> 32:11.783
No.

32:12.950 --> 32:14.719
I had no clue what
I was getting into.

32:16.554 --> 32:20.924
Quinn had just been
diagnosed and I entered this

32:20.958 --> 32:26.798
hotel lobby and saw 400
little Willy's running around.

32:26.831 --> 32:28.466
I'm like, "Oh my God."

32:32.002 --> 32:37.776
I was like a zombie going from
session to session obsessed with

32:38.442 --> 32:41.245
getting information
to somehow fix this

32:41.278 --> 32:44.783
problem and I hadn't even cried
yet.

32:45.583 --> 32:48.820
When a mother learns that she's going
to have to take care of a special

32:48.853 --> 32:53.357
needs child for the rest of her
life she requires a good cry. Right?

32:53.858 --> 32:56.861
Yes, you didn't cry. Not once.

33:00.297 --> 33:03.000
Then I went into the last
session of the weekend.

33:04.368 --> 33:05.837
It was on siblings.

33:06.937 --> 33:11.476
There was this doctor up there with
this long grey hair and this beard,

33:12.276 --> 33:15.012
all these years
of research and experience.

33:15.880 --> 33:20.083
He was talking about how
brothers and sisters of kids with

33:20.117 --> 33:23.922
special needs turn
out to be the most

33:23.954 --> 33:28.460
wonderful loving, giving adults.

33:29.727 --> 33:33.898
I just lost it.

33:35.032 --> 33:38.536
I could not stop crying,
tears just...

33:42.072 --> 33:43.708
because I knew that would be
you.

33:58.723 --> 33:59.724
How's the grill?

34:02.494 --> 34:03.728
Hurts.

34:05.530 --> 34:07.264
Yes, well you'll recover.

34:07.866 --> 34:09.032
I know I will recover.

34:11.435 --> 34:14.036
Look, sometimes it just seems
like you like seeing me hurt.

34:14.071 --> 34:15.907
What the fuck do
you know about hurt?

34:21.513 --> 34:22.714
I'm sorry.

34:25.583 --> 34:26.918
You should check
out my fight against

34:26.951 --> 34:29.754
Ricky Promoter Co
at some point tomorrow.

34:31.288 --> 34:34.592
Pay close attention to my
striking and side leg kicks.

34:35.125 --> 34:36.393
You're telling me this why?

34:36.426 --> 34:38.262
You need to get away from your
judo, Sport.

34:39.096 --> 34:41.766
Destroyed Randa,
it will destroy you.

34:43.132 --> 34:44.902
Jaime wants his fighters
upright,

34:45.402 --> 34:49.741
not swap and spit on the canvas,
capisce?

34:50.072 --> 34:51.074
Kapsosh.

34:57.782 --> 34:58.950
El hombre.

34:58.983 --> 34:59.918
Woman.

34:59.951 --> 35:01.218
La mujer.

35:01.753 --> 35:02.587
Male friend.

35:02.620 --> 35:03.955
El amigo.

35:03.988 --> 35:04.689
Female friend.

35:04.722 --> 35:05.723
La amiga.

35:07.592 --> 35:08.760
Es muy guapo.

35:09.961 --> 35:13.765
Hey, I'm sorry I lost it.

35:16.166 --> 35:16.935
Love you, buddy.

35:18.002 --> 35:19.470
I won't do that again, okay?

35:19.504 --> 35:20.738
Okay.

35:20.772 --> 35:21.773
Are we even?

35:22.974 --> 35:24.776
I'll let you beat me
the next we wrestle.

35:24.809 --> 35:25.810
Just once.

35:27.645 --> 35:31.950
This week we are still using derivatives
to figure out limits but now,

35:32.517 --> 35:37.120
we're looking at limits that
end in indeterminate form.

35:37.755 --> 35:43.160
This is called L'Hôpital's rule.

36:02.212 --> 36:03.982
I just watched the Prootr Co
fight.

36:04.348 --> 36:06.651
Hey, Sport. I just woke up
late.

36:06.684 --> 36:08.151
Can we talk about this at the
gym?

36:08.185 --> 36:09.954
No. Don't give me that. What
gives?

36:10.888 --> 36:14.058
Ricky was supposed to fight Mitch
Radowski next month in Memphis.

36:14.859 --> 36:16.461
Mitch broke his hand yesterday.

36:16.494 --> 36:19.097
Serious? Hell, put me in coach.

36:19.129 --> 36:23.133
Jett, he's a tough fucking thick
neck with 28 fights under his belt.

36:23.468 --> 36:25.036
You have three.

36:25.069 --> 36:27.071
Come on, anytime,
anywhere on a moment's notice, Chief.

36:29.306 --> 36:31.776
All right, pussy hole,
I'll get into it.

36:31.809 --> 36:33.143
All right.

36:34.378 --> 36:36.481
Say it, Quinn. Fuck.

36:36.514 --> 36:39.383
I'm not going to say it.
My mom will kill me.

36:39.416 --> 36:42.152
How will she know? Come on.
Fuck.

36:42.185 --> 36:44.689
Hey, Patrick,
that's not how we roll, my man.

36:44.722 --> 36:47.157
What did I do? Fine.

36:47.492 --> 36:49.894
Hey, kid. Guess what, you get to
ride the bus home with Gerry today.

36:49.927 --> 36:53.230
Wait. What? No chance. No.

36:53.698 --> 36:55.432
What do you mean? You love the
bus.

36:55.833 --> 36:56.901
Not anymore. I don't.

36:56.934 --> 36:58.402
Tanner Van Holt rides it now.

36:58.435 --> 37:00.138
You think I'm bad?

37:00.170 --> 37:02.406
Yes. He said Santa isn't real.

37:02.439 --> 37:04.042
Get out.

37:04.075 --> 37:06.276
Last week, you threw Jerry's
thermos right out the window.

37:08.445 --> 37:09.847
Buy you a new one, Gerry?

37:12.917 --> 37:14.018
Come point him out to me.

37:17.088 --> 37:21.959
Tanner, Van, Holt, number
71.

37:24.462 --> 37:28.198
Hey, Tanner. I'm Jett.

37:28.466 --> 37:30.068
Yes, I know who you are.

37:30.868 --> 37:33.538
You threw Gerry's thermos
off the bus window last week?

37:35.073 --> 37:36.741
I didn't know it was his.

37:36.774 --> 37:38.776
It was rolling around
everyone's feet.

37:38.810 --> 37:41.612
Right. Well, I'm afraid you're going
to have to buy him a new one, my man.

37:41.646 --> 37:47.952
I'm not sure if that's
going to happen, Jett.

37:47.985 --> 37:51.055
It's not a fucking question.
Get him a new fucking thermos.

37:51.089 --> 37:52.289
All right, man. You got it.

37:52.322 --> 37:53.191
You got that?

37:53.223 --> 37:54.092
Yes, man.

37:54.125 --> 37:55.493
Get the fuck out of here.

37:59.396 --> 38:00.397
Hey, Jett.

38:01.966 --> 38:04.535
You think you could have handled
that a bit more diplomatically?

38:04.569 --> 38:05.570
Diplomatically?

38:06.003 --> 38:07.171
Yes, like an adult?

38:08.773 --> 38:10.074
You'll never understand.

38:10.108 --> 38:11.909
I understand a jerk when I see
one.

38:13.243 --> 38:17.247
Can you go ask Tanner nicely if
he'll buy Gerry a new thermos?

38:17.482 --> 38:18.483
Can you do that?

38:19.349 --> 38:20.118
Yes.

38:20.417 --> 38:21.753
You're better than that.

38:24.689 --> 38:30.161
Control the head. Control the head.
Grab your shirt. First triangle.

38:31.361 --> 38:32.797
Good.

38:34.165 --> 38:34.999
God.

38:35.032 --> 38:36.333
Nice.

38:36.366 --> 38:39.670
Hey, Sport. Memphis.
Three weeks. Get psyched.

38:39.704 --> 38:42.607
Are you
ready, Kareef?

38:52.216 --> 38:54.986
You went through a stoplight
with an open container?

38:57.221 --> 38:59.223
Nice example you're
setting for your kid.

39:00.323 --> 39:04.228
Well, you got to learn how to drive
with an OC at some point, sport.

39:05.530 --> 39:09.133
Okay. Rule number one, always
keep

39:09.167 --> 39:11.301
your roadie stove
between your thighs.

39:11.334 --> 39:15.206
When a cop pulls you over,
his first glance is always the cupholder.

39:16.474 --> 39:20.244
Rule number two, never sip while
flying through an intersection.

39:20.678 --> 39:23.313
You got a lot of liberal
homos out there

39:23.346 --> 39:25.483
who'd love to call 911 on your
ass.

39:26.416 --> 39:30.454
Don't let liberal homos see me
drinking while driving. Got it.

39:30.488 --> 39:33.724
Rule number three,
before each swig,

39:33.758 --> 39:36.494
you check your side
views and your rear views.

39:43.067 --> 39:46.237
Rule number four,
in case of an emergency,

39:46.270 --> 39:49.106
hide the said beer in son's
pocket.

40:18.903 --> 40:25.442
I'm going to fucking
kill that bitch.

40:29.080 --> 40:35.052
Motherfucking shit.

40:59.176 --> 41:00.711
Of course. Are you kidding me?

41:00.745 --> 41:01.411
Yes, sir.

41:01.444 --> 41:02.445
Any day.

41:05.082 --> 41:06.484
Thank you, sir.

41:06.517 --> 41:07.450
Yes, sure thing.

41:07.485 --> 41:08.920
Again, my bad.

41:08.953 --> 41:09.620
Yes, sir.

41:09.654 --> 41:10.988
Okay.

41:18.663 --> 41:21.299
Rule number five,
with Cash Boykins,

41:21.332 --> 41:23.334
the previous four rules don't
apply.

41:35.379 --> 41:36.814
All right, Sport.

41:37.715 --> 41:42.286
Come on in, Chief?
Two minutes? Come on, man.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.389
Explain the deal. Get her pumped.
Say hi to your other son?

41:49.460 --> 41:51.329
The shit I do for love.

41:52.897 --> 41:53.698
Jett.

41:53.731 --> 41:55.833
Hey. I've got a surprise.

41:57.201 --> 41:58.836
Quinn, how's it hanging?

41:59.470 --> 42:00.471
Good.

42:02.540 --> 42:03.507
Susie.

42:04.475 --> 42:05.376
Cash.

42:06.577 --> 42:08.713
Look, you two need to talk.

42:09.347 --> 42:11.215
Will you both please
take the high road?

42:11.515 --> 42:13.417
I have, hundreds of times.

42:14.185 --> 42:15.353
The low road's better.

42:20.591 --> 42:23.527
Jett, can you get a
bath going for Quinn?

42:24.662 --> 42:25.563
He's stinky.

42:25.596 --> 42:27.531
No, I'll put on deoderant.

42:27.565 --> 42:29.367
No, you need to soak, okay?

42:29.400 --> 42:31.035
Come on, Quinn. Let's go.

42:33.270 --> 42:34.271
All right, guys.

42:39.877 --> 42:41.012
Got anything to drink?

42:41.445 --> 42:44.215
Just Chardonnay, in the fridge.

42:50.621 --> 42:52.890
For the love of Christ.

43:02.233 --> 43:05.369
I can remember your Two-Buck
Chucks smelling like cat piss.

43:05.403 --> 43:07.104
You don't remember a lot of
things.

43:07.772 --> 43:12.243
Oh, fuck me. I walked
right into that one, didn't I?

43:16.213 --> 43:17.715
What do I owe this pleasure?

43:21.486 --> 43:23.455
Got Jett a fight for the 28th.

43:24.288 --> 43:30.594
WFA 247 in Memphis, third undercard
against Tricky Ricky Promotor Co.

43:31.496 --> 43:32.396
Remember him?

43:33.465 --> 43:34.466
Jesus.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.270
Number 12 contender, should
be a solid litmus test for him.

43:40.004 --> 43:41.005
Can he beat him?

43:42.606 --> 43:44.608
Well, his kickboxing
certainly improved.

43:44.642 --> 43:45.876
His grappling's solid.

43:45.910 --> 43:46.911
What about his judo?

43:46.944 --> 43:49.580
Fuck judo. What he needs is a
jab.

43:49.613 --> 43:50.614
So find him one.

43:57.822 --> 43:59.458
Does he need to miss school?

44:01.125 --> 44:03.260
No. No, shouldn't.

44:04.261 --> 44:07.264
Two hours with Kareef before
and after school should suffice.

44:12.504 --> 44:13.971
How much?

44:14.004 --> 44:18.309
WFA minimum, $10,000 a show,
another $10,000 for a win.

44:18.709 --> 44:20.711
I may be able to bump
that up to $15,000.

44:22.514 --> 44:25.550
I could front you $10,000 now
if you need help with Quinn.

44:27.051 --> 44:29.386
We're not a fucking daycare
service, Susan.

44:32.323 --> 44:33.824
Yes. That was my fault, I'm
sorry.

44:33.858 --> 44:37.161
I knew you were incapable,
but I rolled the dice anyway.

44:38.530 --> 44:39.531
All right.

44:41.298 --> 44:45.202
Well, I'll have Patty wire the
10Gs into your account tomorrow.

44:46.538 --> 44:47.671
You're welcome, Susie.

44:48.339 --> 44:49.740
Fuck you, Cash.

45:03.821 --> 45:06.690
Boykins, take a seat.
I'm now pissed.

45:09.426 --> 45:11.195
Fucking stinks like a bitch.

45:11.228 --> 45:13.731
Fuck it. Your inside
leg kicks are killing him.

45:13.764 --> 45:15.733
He opened himself
up to a traingle chop.

45:15.766 --> 45:17.701
I know. I fucking blew it.

45:17.735 --> 45:19.604
If he does it again,
you put him to sleep.

45:20.171 --> 45:21.405
Time is up.

45:21.906 --> 45:23.207
Let's end this shit now.

45:23.240 --> 45:24.975
- Go, baby. Let's go.
- Let's go.

45:25.009 --> 45:26.578
How did you score round two,
Tyron?

45:26.611 --> 45:27.711
I had that as a-

45:27.745 --> 45:28.647
- Keep your focus. Stay focus
now.

45:28.679 --> 45:29.747
big round for Boykin.

45:29.780 --> 45:30.649
Barely minimal.
It's 10, nine, nine.

45:30.681 --> 45:32.416
Come on, Champ. Not this.

45:33.384 --> 45:35.753
It's been a very
close fight so far.

45:35.786 --> 45:38.789
It may very well come
down to round three here.

45:39.356 --> 45:41.560
Moleko is very fast.
That's a fast one.

45:41.593 --> 45:42.193
I know.

45:42.893 --> 45:43.794
That's the kick.

45:46.598 --> 45:48.600
He's going for a heel hook.

45:50.367 --> 45:52.069
What an escape by Boykins.

45:52.803 --> 45:55.039
Get this motherfucker.

45:55.940 --> 45:58.842
Counter. Big counter.
He's looking to-

45:58.876 --> 46:03.615
- I think it's a counter. Ground
and pound. I think he's back up.

46:03.648 --> 46:05.783
They are eating some
huge shock to this fight.

46:05.816 --> 46:07.451
Look at this, a luminary rope.

46:07.785 --> 46:09.787
Rolls right into his shoulder
lock.

46:09.820 --> 46:11.855
Over plot. Now, we do a
triangle.

46:11.889 --> 46:16.227
Come on.

46:16.727 --> 46:17.728
There you go.

46:18.963 --> 46:20.864
He takes the advantage.
Now going for the body.

46:20.898 --> 46:23.602
He's taking punches but he's
dishing him out as well.

46:23.635 --> 46:24.401
Oh my...

46:25.836 --> 46:29.373
Going back and forth.

46:29.406 --> 46:31.742
Just exhausted to end round
three.

46:31.775 --> 46:33.645
It could come down
to a split decision.

46:33.678 --> 46:36.615
The fight was very close.
Even that round, it was a thing.

46:36.648 --> 46:39.651
What a fight. This is
really too close to call here.

46:39.684 --> 46:41.986
Now, you got that baby.
It's all you.

46:43.254 --> 46:44.855
The judges are taking their
time.

46:47.825 --> 46:50.595
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a split decision.

46:52.263 --> 46:56.767
Judge Watson scores the fight
29-28.

46:57.134 --> 46:59.638
Boykins.

46:59.671 --> 47:00.804
You're a smart man.

47:02.273 --> 47:06.176
Judge Goldstone scores
the fight 30-27 for Motoco.

47:07.545 --> 47:08.812
You are a cheat.

47:08.846 --> 47:09.514
Come on.

47:09.547 --> 47:10.582
Nobody likes you.

47:10.615 --> 47:13.652
Judge Max scores the fight
29-28.

47:14.051 --> 47:18.422
The winner, the Pride of
Ramses High.

47:20.291 --> 47:21.825
Jett Boykins is your winner.

47:21.859 --> 47:23.662
You showed a lot of heart there,
champ.

47:23.695 --> 47:25.129
Unbelievable fight.

47:35.873 --> 47:36.874
That's what I'm talking about.

47:37.875 --> 47:38.543
I didn't doubt it for a second.

47:38.576 --> 47:39.477
Come here.

47:39.511 --> 47:40.110
I didn't doubt it for a second.

48:03.735 --> 48:06.771
Thank you. Good day. Good
stuff.

48:20.585 --> 48:21.753
That was super, Jett.

48:22.019 --> 48:26.223
Good for the soul, Jerry.
Your ball buster.

48:33.230 --> 48:34.932
Have you seen what's on chapter
15?

48:35.600 --> 48:38.235
Point conversions.
That's what I live for.

48:38.636 --> 48:41.438
Now, you care about conversions.
You're on autopilot girl.

48:43.608 --> 48:44.809
What do you mean autopilot?

48:46.310 --> 48:48.879
You didn't hear?
Kim got accepted into West Point.

48:57.388 --> 48:58.757
Damn.

48:59.990 --> 49:01.425
Is there anything you can't do?

49:08.767 --> 49:09.768
Don't get me wrong.

49:11.301 --> 49:15.139
I'm thankful to you both.
You built a $5 billion Goliath.

49:15.807 --> 49:19.611
As a result, many of us have
created a level of wealth behind

49:19.644 --> 49:23.280
our wildest dreams
but in the last five years,

49:23.848 --> 49:28.252
you think in addition to owning
the WFA, you own its fighters.

49:29.654 --> 49:31.556
I don't blame
you for thinking like that.

49:31.589 --> 49:36.594
We've allowed ourselves to be owned.
You got five bill.

49:37.161 --> 49:42.032
Well, 95% of your fighters under
your banner have very little savings,

49:42.634 --> 49:45.804
health insurance that only covers
injuries, no pension funds.

49:45.837 --> 49:47.938
You participate in revenue
sharing.

49:47.971 --> 49:49.106
Yes, we do, Jamie.

49:50.842 --> 49:55.480
Revenue sharing amongst the 512
WFA fighters under contract is 8%.

49:57.214 --> 50:00.485
NFL owners and players
split revenues 50-50.

50:00.885 --> 50:05.790
When you look at it like that, boys,
the WFA is a nice form of slavery.

50:06.724 --> 50:08.860
I have heard enough of this
shit.

50:08.893 --> 50:10.327
Calm down, Jamie.

50:10.360 --> 50:13.030
We fighters,
we come from very little means, Rami.

50:14.131 --> 50:18.302
When I was in sixth grade,
Sherman Steel kicked my ass.

50:19.637 --> 50:22.607
I didn't come home for three
motherfucking days because

50:22.640 --> 50:27.211
I knew my old man would beat me 10
times worse for, "Losing to a nigger."

50:27.978 --> 50:32.316
I remember my first MMA paycheck.
$1850.

50:33.417 --> 50:36.921
I went out, bought myself a 12'er
of Nati light, paid my rent,

50:37.321 --> 50:40.023
pulled Jamie aside, and said,
"God bless you, Messa.

50:40.324 --> 50:41.893
Thank you, thank you."

50:41.926 --> 50:44.027
You are such a prick. I can't...

50:44.061 --> 50:46.430
Goddammit, the truth hurts,
doesn't it, Jamie?

50:46.931 --> 50:51.836
Here's the deal,
I own two WFA belts.

50:52.704 --> 50:54.939
I bring in three million
pay-per-views per fight.

50:55.773 --> 50:59.844
Without me, WFA is just three
letters in the fucking alphabet.

51:08.352 --> 51:09.888
We're a little bigger than
that, Champ.

51:09.921 --> 51:11.021
Oh, yes?

51:11.054 --> 51:11.990
A little.

51:14.459 --> 51:19.898
But you are a very
important part of the family,

51:21.533 --> 51:23.100
very important.

51:23.133 --> 51:23.968
Thanks.

51:27.906 --> 51:30.475
What do you want, Cash?

51:30.942 --> 51:35.713
You gentlemen need to put together
a package, full insurance, benefits,

51:35.747 --> 51:38.883
pensions, higher revenue
sharing, upping the minimums.

51:38.917 --> 51:40.217
Cash.

51:40.250 --> 51:41.953
I better not want to wipe
my ass with it, Rami,

51:42.820 --> 51:45.122
because we're this close
to organizing a union.

51:46.156 --> 51:49.928
I won't get every fighter to
join, but I'll get 40%.

51:50.962 --> 51:54.398
I'll establish an NLRB board.
We'll have elections.

51:55.132 --> 52:00.237
Oh, yes, baby.
It'll be quite the ass-fucking.

52:01.773 --> 52:02.774
Come on, David.

52:14.619 --> 52:16.754
You want me to put a little
smiling face emoji on it?

52:16.788 --> 52:19.457
Sure.

52:19.857 --> 52:20.959
Nice job.

52:22.326 --> 52:24.629
Okay, I have $20.

52:25.128 --> 52:28.633
With that $20, I decide
if I'm going to do this right,

52:28.666 --> 52:30.602
I need to get my breath fresh,"

52:31.168 --> 52:32.169
so I bought toothpaste.

52:32.537 --> 52:34.038
Toothpaste costs $4.75.

52:35.039 --> 52:36.774
I'm going to get a loaf
of bread because

52:36.808 --> 52:39.142
I need to make a sandwich when I get
home, preferably, I like salami.

52:39.176 --> 52:41.244
You know what I mean?
I don't know about you all.

52:41.278 --> 52:42.981
What's your favorite sandwich?

52:43.014 --> 52:44.147
Pepperoni sandwich.

52:44.181 --> 52:45.583
Oh, you love pepperoni
sandwich?

52:45.617 --> 52:47.018
That's some good pepperoni.

52:47.051 --> 52:48.251
All right,
let's get into the problem now.

52:48.285 --> 52:50.655
Here we go. $20, right?
Everybody see that?

52:51.221 --> 52:52.991
Yes.

52:53.024 --> 52:54.959
Okay, with that $20, I decide to
buy a toothpaste that costs $4.75.

52:54.993 --> 52:56.861
With that $4.75, I also decided,
"You know what?

52:56.894 --> 52:58.663
I'm going to buy some
bread that costs $3."

52:58.696 --> 53:00.297
How much change do I get back?

53:01.499 --> 53:02.265
Go ahead, Quinn.

53:02.299 --> 53:04.035
$12.25.

53:04.502 --> 53:09.974
- That's right. $12.25.
- My man. $12.25.

53:11.308 --> 53:12.710
Have a good day.

53:12.744 --> 53:15.379
I'll see you guys later.
Have a good day. Enjoy it.

53:15.412 --> 53:17.482
Get out in the sun.
Get some vitamin D.

53:17.515 --> 53:18.281
Killing it.

53:18.315 --> 53:19.383
Get some vitamin D, boy.

53:20.084 --> 53:21.451
I know.

53:21.486 --> 53:22.820
I'll come get you in a bit,
all right?

53:22.854 --> 53:24.187
Okay.

53:25.155 --> 53:26.824
You're a good dude, Mr.
Stewart.

53:26.858 --> 53:28.993
Thank you, Jett.
You're a good dude yourself.

53:29.527 --> 53:33.196
Hey, I have an old Army buddy
whose son wants to get into MMA.

53:33.230 --> 53:35.298
Is there any chance
we could get coffee.

53:35.332 --> 53:36.734
Yes, of course. Anytime.

53:36.768 --> 53:39.003
Awesome. You're awesome for
that, thank you, man.

53:39.837 --> 53:41.338
Hey, do you know Keaton
Carmichael?

53:41.371 --> 53:44.042
I do know Keaton.
I wrote her a letter of commendation.

53:44.075 --> 53:45.308
Wait, you went to West Point?

53:45.342 --> 53:47.210
No, but after the Silver Star,

53:47.679 --> 53:50.114
I was fortunate enough
to meet Senator Cummings,

53:50.447 --> 53:54.418
and to get into West Point,
you need to be sponsored by a senator so.

53:54.451 --> 53:56.087
Moving and shaking, Mr.
Stewart.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.555
Bam, bam. That's how I do it.

53:59.457 --> 54:00.458
Are you married?

54:00.892 --> 54:01.859
No.

54:01.893 --> 54:03.061
Girlfriend?

54:03.094 --> 54:04.261
You're starting to scare me.

54:04.294 --> 54:05.029
It's not for me.

54:05.063 --> 54:06.097
Okay.

54:06.130 --> 54:08.633
Okay?
I think I got somebody for you.

54:09.067 --> 54:12.704
Great, I haven't been
out on a date in a long time.

54:13.137 --> 54:14.371
Yes?

54:14.404 --> 54:16.074
I think everybody wants
to roll with you, man.

54:16.107 --> 54:20.912
Well, I do know how to roll.

54:20.945 --> 54:22.046
You know what I'm saying?

54:22.080 --> 54:24.082
I don't mean to sound shallow,
but...

54:24.115 --> 54:25.049
Don't say it, mom.

54:25.083 --> 54:26.050
He's in a wheelchair.

54:27.217 --> 54:28.251
Yes, that's what happens when
brave

54:28.285 --> 54:30.121
men go out to war and get shot,
mother.

54:30.154 --> 54:33.091
He's good-looking, he's great with
Quinn, his penis still works.

54:34.291 --> 54:36.928
Tell me you did not
ask about his penis.

54:36.961 --> 54:38.295
Of course I did.

54:38.328 --> 54:39.697
You think I want my mom
hanging with some flat tire?

54:41.331 --> 54:42.700
Jett William Boykins, tell me
you didn't ask about his penis.

54:42.734 --> 54:44.068
Penis.

54:44.102 --> 54:46.137
No, I didn't.
I had Derril ask him.

54:46.170 --> 54:47.138
He was subtle about it.

54:47.171 --> 54:48.906
Oh, sure.

54:51.976 --> 54:57.347
One, two, three,

54:59.117 --> 55:02.553
four, four, five.

55:02.587 --> 55:05.422
This might be the
worse pushups I've ever seen.

55:05.757 --> 55:07.925
Well, yes. I learned it from
you.

55:07.959 --> 55:09.961
Yes? Well,
you bend these little arms.

55:09.994 --> 55:11.162
Let go of your hand.

55:11.195 --> 55:12.096
What are you going to do?

55:12.130 --> 55:13.363
I'll kick your freaking ass.

55:14.632 --> 55:18.536
Mom, help. Ow. Ow.

55:21.038 --> 55:23.107
Damn. Where has this been?

55:25.009 --> 55:26.978
I heard Mr. Stewart's stacked.

55:28.846 --> 55:30.347
Kampai.

55:30.380 --> 55:32.150
Kampai.

55:32.183 --> 55:33.184
To a great mom.

55:34.852 --> 55:36.220
I don't know about that.

55:36.554 --> 55:38.556
Come on, Susan. Just say thank
you.

55:39.190 --> 55:39.924
Thank you.

55:39.957 --> 55:42.126
Yes.

55:42.160 --> 55:45.797
I feel like single moms with special
needs kids have it the hardest.

55:45.830 --> 55:47.131
It's been quite a ride.

55:47.465 --> 55:49.000
Yes, I know.

55:51.401 --> 55:52.136
Yes?

55:52.170 --> 55:53.204
Yes.

55:53.971 --> 55:55.206
How much do you know?

55:57.475 --> 55:59.744
I know everything. It's my job
to.

56:02.379 --> 56:05.483
Has Quinn ever
talked to you about it?

56:07.417 --> 56:11.889
No. I mean, honestly,
I don't think he remembers.

56:13.191 --> 56:14.826
Do you have discussed it with
Jett?

56:14.859 --> 56:20.565
Tidbits here and there.
He doesn't remember the big stuff.

56:24.669 --> 56:28.506
You know when Jett-

56:30.208 --> 56:31.374
-Set us up?

56:31.408 --> 56:34.178
Yes. When he set us
up, I googled you.

56:34.512 --> 56:36.214
No.

56:36.247 --> 56:41.586
Yes. I totally did.
You were a top-ranked tennis player.

56:42.419 --> 56:44.255
Hard to believe, right?
Look at me now.

56:44.288 --> 56:47.258
What are you talking about?
You look amazing. You do.

56:47.291 --> 56:49.193
Thank you.

56:54.298 --> 56:57.235
You are grounded, young lady.

56:57.535 --> 56:58.536
What?

56:58.569 --> 57:00.838
Hey, no excuses. Pee in this
cup.

57:00.872 --> 57:06.077
No phone for a week. So?

57:11.381 --> 57:14.051
It was nice. Thank you.

57:14.318 --> 57:15.486
No problem.

57:18.556 --> 57:19.557
I love you.

57:21.492 --> 57:22.293
I love you too, mom.

57:52.422 --> 57:54.725
Hey. Come here, little guy.
Come here. Come on.

57:54.759 --> 57:57.427
Show me what you got.
Show me these tough hands.

57:57.461 --> 57:59.463
All right, one, two, three.
Show me the hands.

57:59.497 --> 58:01.132
Show me the hands.

58:01.165 --> 58:03.301
What's it like being a Stewardess?
Are you afraid of flying?

58:03.334 --> 58:05.469
No, I really enjoy it. I get
to-

58:05.503 --> 58:06.971
- All right. Stand there.
Stand there. Put your hands up.

58:07.004 --> 58:10.341
Remember? Hands up.
No. What are you doing?

58:10.374 --> 58:13.144
You're not paying attention.
Listen to me.

58:13.544 --> 58:14.679
One, two, three, come on.

58:14.712 --> 58:15.479
What's wrong?

58:15.513 --> 58:16.347
Focus. One, two, three.

58:18.816 --> 58:22.086
No. You're laughing.
What is that? What is that?

58:22.119 --> 58:23.454
That's not what I taught you.

58:23.487 --> 58:24.655
This tastes like shit.

58:24.689 --> 58:26.223
Come on. Pay attention.

58:33.397 --> 58:35.900
No. What are you doing?

58:36.701 --> 58:39.403
You're not listening to me.

58:41.639 --> 58:43.874
Pay attention.

58:43.908 --> 58:49.480
I don't want you growing
up to be a pussy.

59:12.069 --> 59:16.173
Come on, pussy boy.

01:00:40.357 --> 01:00:45.429
I'm going to fucking
kill that bitch.

01:00:48.365 --> 01:00:52.069
Motherfucking shit.

01:01:15.793 --> 01:01:17.161
What the fuck?

01:01:18.696 --> 01:01:21.533
You're trying to kill him.
You're trying to kill him.

01:01:21.566 --> 01:01:24.469
Do you remember that?
Do you remember?

01:01:24.503 --> 01:01:25.504
Because I fucking do.

01:01:25.537 --> 01:01:27.271
You little motherfucker.

01:01:27.304 --> 01:01:30.841
I don't fucking need you anymore.
I'm not helpless. Fuck you, man.

01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:32.109
I don't fucking need you.

01:01:32.143 --> 01:01:33.377
You just shut your own
fucking throat, bitch.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:34.845
Quinn. Quinn.

01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:37.715
Cash, stop. Cash, relax. Stop
it.

01:01:37.748 --> 01:01:38.816
Relax, man.

01:01:41.385 --> 01:01:42.820
All right. I'm good, I'm good.

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:48.092
Get him out of here.
Get him out of here.

01:01:51.428 --> 01:01:53.097
Everybody, time to go.

01:02:09.548 --> 01:02:10.582
Jake.

01:02:12.783 --> 01:02:13.518
Jake.

01:02:22.693 --> 01:02:23.628
Why did I black it out?

01:02:29.366 --> 01:02:33.137
I remember him hitting you,
and the police,

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.475
I just didn't remember why.

01:02:43.881 --> 01:02:45.449
Maybe you wanted to forget.

01:03:01.832 --> 01:03:03.668
Patty, love it.

01:03:04.268 --> 01:03:05.869
How far are you willing
to go with this?

01:03:05.903 --> 01:03:09.039
Pay me 100 grand for the entire
video, and you'll find out.

01:03:11.842 --> 01:03:12.776
Fuck.

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:13.478
You piece of shit.

01:03:13.511 --> 01:03:14.646
What the fuck?

01:03:15.279 --> 01:03:16.780
Cash.

01:03:16.814 --> 01:03:19.450
You're trying to kill him.
You're trying to kill him.

01:03:19.484 --> 01:03:22.052
Do you remember that?
Do you remember?

01:03:22.086 --> 01:03:23.655
Because I fucking do.

01:03:23.688 --> 01:03:24.955
You little motherfucker.

01:03:24.989 --> 01:03:26.257
I don't fucking need you
anymore.

01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:55.647
Did you know there's a news
van?

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.516
Yes, I know. Come in.
We've been here ever since it went viral.

01:04:59.883 --> 01:05:03.755
You have vocab on Wednesday
and biology's on Friday

01:05:04.288 --> 01:05:06.725
and your written
assignment is in this folder.

01:05:07.525 --> 01:05:08.793
It's pretty self-explanatory.

01:05:09.561 --> 01:05:10.562
Thank you.

01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:13.230
Where did he come from?

01:05:14.298 --> 01:05:17.535
He just crashed.
He was up all night.

01:05:17.802 --> 01:05:20.739
All the online stuff sent
his anxiety through the roof.

01:05:21.639 --> 01:05:25.710
He's so sweet. I just love him.
I'd kill for those lips.

01:05:26.043 --> 01:05:27.411
The hair is what gets me.

01:05:29.213 --> 01:05:30.782
I've tried every gel known to man
and still can't figure it out.

01:05:31.382 --> 01:05:32.383
Welcome to Holland.

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:34.652
What?

01:05:36.053 --> 01:05:38.790
Welcome to Holland, the poem.
You have to read it.

01:05:39.758 --> 01:05:43.595
It was written by a mother whose son
has Down's, I'm paraphrasing here.

01:05:44.928 --> 01:05:46.897
When a woman is getting
ready to have a baby,

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.267
it's like planning a trip to Italy.
She was excited.

01:05:50.602 --> 01:05:55.807
She buys six guidebooks and plans a
trip to the Vatican, the Colosseum,

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.841
a winery in Florence.

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:01.746
When she arrives, the pilot
says, "Welcome to Holland."

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.550
She's like, "Holland?
No, no, I signed up for Italy.

01:06:05.583 --> 01:06:07.951
There's no way in hell
I'm staying in Holland."

01:06:07.985 --> 01:06:11.790
But she has no choice,
that's where she landed.

01:06:14.425 --> 01:06:17.862
She learns Dutch
and she buys new guidebooks.

01:06:19.597 --> 01:06:23.167
She visits the windmills
and sees a few Rembrandts.

01:06:24.636 --> 01:06:27.839
All the while, all her friends
are just living it up in Italy,

01:06:28.172 --> 01:06:29.808
bragging about how great it is.

01:06:32.877 --> 01:06:36.113
She realizes that
she can't let it get to her.

01:06:37.948 --> 01:06:41.985
She can't spend time mourning
over Italy because then she'll

01:06:42.953 --> 01:06:45.657
never be free to appreciate
the true beauty of Holland.

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:56.634
I'm not sure if I love
that poem or despise it.

01:06:57.301 --> 01:07:00.370
Yes, me neither. I appreciate
it.

01:07:03.207 --> 01:07:07.846
I appreciate you.
Thank you, Keaton.

01:07:09.079 --> 01:07:10.080
I mean it.

01:07:10.882 --> 01:07:13.885
You're welcome, Jett, I mean
it.

01:07:27.932 --> 01:07:32.770
Look, Cash, I don't know
who leaked it and I don't care.

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:34.739
You don't know who leaked it.

01:07:35.072 --> 01:07:37.107
You must think I'm fucking
stupid, Rami.

01:07:39.777 --> 01:07:42.179
You don't think I know what
goes on in my own camp?

01:07:43.046 --> 01:07:44.582
I just follow the numbers.

01:07:45.082 --> 01:07:48.720
As do I, which is why I thanked
the bitch before I fired her.

01:07:50.688 --> 01:07:51.956
Let's talk cabbage.

01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:55.292
Okay.

01:07:58.095 --> 01:08:03.200
50 million upfront, guaranteed.

01:08:04.969 --> 01:08:08.138
What are we looking at?
Five million pay-per-views, six?

01:08:09.306 --> 01:08:11.976
Jamie is probably still
jerking off to YouTube.

01:08:12.477 --> 01:08:13.811
I can't pull it out.

01:08:15.914 --> 01:08:16.915
The catch, Rami?

01:08:18.148 --> 01:08:20.149
The catch is you drop
this union nonsense,

01:08:21.084 --> 01:08:22.720
pensions, healthcare, all that.

01:08:22.754 --> 01:08:23.755
Forget it.

01:08:25.288 --> 01:08:27.559
Come on, Cash, you honestly
want to spend the next 10 years

01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:30.327
of your life in court flying
back and forth to LA.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:37.301
I will never allow a union,
not now, not ever.

01:08:54.018 --> 01:08:55.653
I only want five million
upfront.

01:08:57.455 --> 01:09:00.157
If word ever leaked out to my fanbase
that I was guaranteed 50 mils,

01:09:01.425 --> 01:09:04.261
25% wouldn't buy the fight
out of principle alone.

01:09:05.997 --> 01:09:08.866
I want half of everything else.

01:09:11.803 --> 01:09:13.504
You're insane.

01:09:13.537 --> 01:09:16.439
You're asking me to fight my own
son, you fucking goat roper.

01:09:17.341 --> 01:09:21.045
Half the gate, half the
merchandise, half all pay per view,

01:09:21.613 --> 01:09:28.019
and access to the books. That's
the deal, decide now. Yes or no?

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:34.024
Up to you, pal.

01:09:39.162 --> 01:09:40.865
Keep smiling, Rami.

01:09:49.807 --> 01:09:51.576
Please tell me
you're not doing this.

01:09:52.676 --> 01:09:53.377
Doing what?

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:54.679
Fighting Jett.

01:10:01.385 --> 01:10:02.452
I'm done.

01:10:02.487 --> 01:10:03.721
What?

01:10:03.755 --> 01:10:05.188
I'm so fucking done with you.
I'm done.

01:10:05.222 --> 01:10:06.057
How are you done, Jade?

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:07.458
He's your son, Cash.

01:10:07.492 --> 01:10:10.895
Hey, how are you done?
Divorce done?

01:10:11.261 --> 01:10:13.865
You better fucking answer me.
How are you done?

01:10:13.898 --> 01:10:15.298
Cash, you're hurting me.

01:10:15.332 --> 01:10:17.535
This will be the last fucking
mistake you ever made.

01:10:19.236 --> 01:10:20.638
Are you threatening me?

01:10:20.672 --> 01:10:22.707
Oh, it's not a threat, baby.
It's a fact.

01:10:24.676 --> 01:10:27.111
If you're smart,
you'll learn the fucking difference.

01:10:34.251 --> 01:10:35.053
I'm sorry.

01:10:40.257 --> 01:10:43.127
He offered us half,
baby, of everything.

01:10:44.729 --> 01:10:51.636
We'll make $100 million on this
fight alone, maybe even $200. Jade.

01:10:56.306 --> 01:10:59.242
Good evening. Welcome to the
Yard.

01:10:59.276 --> 01:11:01.278
We've got some great specials
today.

01:11:01.311 --> 01:11:02.480
Hello, Susan.

01:11:07.151 --> 01:11:08.786
Hey.

01:11:24.502 --> 01:11:26.170
You've been offered another
fight.

01:11:28.906 --> 01:11:32.309
Child Services should lock me up
for even mentioning this to you.

01:11:32.342 --> 01:11:33.111
Tell me.

01:11:37.347 --> 01:11:39.249
Boykins versus Boykins.

01:11:42.487 --> 01:11:43.588
God.

01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:46.190
How much?

01:11:47.024 --> 01:11:48.126
$200,000.

01:11:48.159 --> 01:11:51.462
Holy crap. Did he agree to it?

01:11:51.496 --> 01:11:52.630
You can't do this.

01:11:52.663 --> 01:11:53.965
What do you mean?
Of course, I can do it.

01:11:53.998 --> 01:11:55.398
I can't in good conscience.

01:11:55.432 --> 01:11:57.168
Look, mom.
I'm 18, I can do whatever I want.

01:11:57.201 --> 01:12:00.138
Jett, you're not thinking
about the ramifications.

01:12:00.171 --> 01:12:01.172
It's $200,000, mom.

01:12:01.205 --> 01:12:02.974
He can kill you, baby.

01:12:03.007 --> 01:12:03.674
Stop.

01:12:03.708 --> 01:12:05.408
I know him too well.

01:12:05.442 --> 01:12:08.746
After that video and all the
shit he's taken on social media,

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.947
he wants to kill you.

01:12:09.981 --> 01:12:11.314
Mom, I'm his son.

01:12:11.348 --> 01:12:15.119
He's a psychopath.
Please, sweetheart, for me.

01:12:16.353 --> 01:12:21.125
Just give yourself one more year.
I mean, you are a child.

01:12:21.459 --> 01:12:24.128
There will be other opportunities
like this. I promise you.

01:12:24.162 --> 01:12:25.029
What if there's none?

01:12:25.062 --> 01:12:26.329
Then this wasn't meant to be-

01:12:26.363 --> 01:12:27.031
-No-

01:12:27.064 --> 01:12:27.598
...in the first place.

01:12:27.632 --> 01:12:29.299
...no, no. Fuck.

01:12:29.332 --> 01:12:30.535
Please don't do this.

01:12:30.568 --> 01:12:32.670
No. This isn't about you, mom.

01:12:33.738 --> 01:12:36.406
It's not about
you and it's not about Quinn.

01:12:37.542 --> 01:12:39.744
For once, it's about me.

01:12:50.855 --> 01:12:52.490
I didn't think I'd see you
again.

01:12:54.258 --> 01:12:55.193
That makes two of us.

01:12:56.426 --> 01:12:57.795
I bet your head is
spinning in a hundred

01:12:57.829 --> 01:12:59.564
different directions
right about now.

01:13:00.064 --> 01:13:01.265
Yes.

01:13:03.034 --> 01:13:04.836
I was just listening to a guy on a
podcast, he called you insane.

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:06.838
He's got me pegged.

01:13:12.076 --> 01:13:14.846
I'm here because I wanted
to thank you, Ms. Malek,

01:13:16.013 --> 01:13:19.717
and all my teachers who've
bent over backward for me.

01:13:22.419 --> 01:13:24.222
That's what makes this so hard.

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:29.193
I really want to graduate
and someday go to college,

01:13:29.227 --> 01:13:32.997
but I don't know how
to make it all work right now.

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:34.699
Don't drop out, Jett.

01:13:36.033 --> 01:13:37.602
I'm missing my semester finals.

01:13:38.269 --> 01:13:39.604
Take them after you win.

01:13:45.276 --> 01:13:47.011
Look, I'll take care of the
powers that be on this end.

01:13:47.044 --> 01:13:50.248
You just take care
of business on yours. Good?

01:13:51.381 --> 01:13:52.750
Thank you.

01:13:53.918 --> 01:13:56.287
You know all the great
mathematicians were insane?

01:13:59.156 --> 01:14:00.892
Maybe that's how you approach
this.

01:14:02.392 --> 01:14:04.829
You have one very difficult
problem in front of you.

01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:06.931
Solve it.

01:14:22.914 --> 01:14:24.248
Hey, grab a pen and paper.

01:14:25.116 --> 01:14:26.183
Yes, I'm ready.

01:14:26.751 --> 01:14:32.490
429241017.

01:14:33.157 --> 01:14:34.424
Who am I calling?

01:14:36.794 --> 01:14:38.195
That's a closed number.

01:14:38.496 --> 01:14:40.264
The only one who
will beat you there.

01:14:41.532 --> 01:14:42.934
I'll see you in Vegas.

01:14:49.607 --> 01:14:52.143
Motherfucking Kareef hooked it
up, baby.

01:14:52.877 --> 01:14:54.412
Lovely guy.

01:16:21.432 --> 01:16:22.600
Jett.

01:16:23.601 --> 01:16:25.369
You're joking, right? Claude.

01:16:25.403 --> 01:16:26.871
Truly.

01:16:26.904 --> 01:16:29.240
No, no, no. I'm a hugger.
You better get used to it.

01:16:30.441 --> 01:16:31.609
You're hungry?

01:16:31.642 --> 01:16:33.077
Yes.

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:34.111
All right, come inside
and we'll get you set up.

01:16:34.145 --> 01:16:34.678
Let me help you, give me your
bag.

01:16:34.712 --> 01:16:35.780
Thanks.

01:16:35.813 --> 01:16:39.316
This way.
Give me your phone, please.

01:16:44.789 --> 01:16:48.893
You'll see it in one month.
This way. Voila.

01:16:51.796 --> 01:16:52.963
Smells good.

01:16:52.997 --> 01:16:53.631
Nice.

01:16:53.664 --> 01:16:54.665
Bon appetit, guys.

01:16:57.334 --> 01:16:58.335
Are you scared?

01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:05.342
Yes.

01:17:07.479 --> 01:17:09.413
For two decades now,

01:17:09.447 --> 01:17:12.817
Cash Boykins has been one of the most
polarizing athletes in all of sports.

01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:14.985
He's not a modern-day
slice of Americana.

01:17:15.019 --> 01:17:18.055
He's the whole pie. Why this
fight?

01:17:18.089 --> 01:17:21.092
Why your own son? For the money?

01:17:21.526 --> 01:17:23.027
Revenge for that post?

01:17:25.329 --> 01:17:26.964
Or does it go even deeper?

01:17:27.631 --> 01:17:31.470
Look, Jett has a lot of talent
and he's got a bright future.

01:17:32.537 --> 01:17:35.272
But he won't improve
unless he fights the best.

01:17:36.541 --> 01:17:39.544
Unfortunately, that's me.

01:17:40.311 --> 01:17:43.380
The Apocalypse is finally upon
us.

01:17:43.714 --> 01:17:46.650
We are just a few weeks
away from what promises

01:17:46.684 --> 01:17:50.489
to be the most controversial
fight in WFA history,

01:17:50.522 --> 01:17:54.859
between Cash Boykins
and his 18-year-old son Jett.

01:17:54.892 --> 01:17:56.461
How about that, partner?

01:17:56.495 --> 01:17:58.696
Syd, honestly, I believe
we've officially reached a new

01:17:58.729 --> 01:18:00.865
low in this great
country you call America.

01:18:01.365 --> 01:18:03.134
I don't care how much money
he's-

01:18:03.167 --> 01:18:06.137
- You don't care about how much
money, what planet are you from?

01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:09.707
Fathers don't fight sons under
any circumstance. This is family.

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:12.843
Family who don't much
like each other right now.

01:18:12.877 --> 01:18:16.515
Here's the deal, the fight
game is all about the Benjamins.

01:18:16.548 --> 01:18:17.181
Sure.

01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:18.449
It's about money.

01:18:18.483 --> 01:18:21.752
If there is a specific demand,
you go after it.

01:18:22.554 --> 01:18:25.122
Jett's fight against Promotico,
did you even watch it?

01:18:25.156 --> 01:18:26.957
I did. I did. Thank you, Syd.

01:18:26.991 --> 01:18:30.562
Yes, but Tricky Ricky Promotico ain't
Liquid Cash Boykins, the Slayer.

01:18:30.595 --> 01:18:34.064
Cash is the greatest fighter
in the history of the sport

01:18:34.098 --> 01:18:37.668
and this boy has a zero percent
chance of beating the king.

01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:40.539
Zero percent would
mean there's zero appeal,

01:18:40.572 --> 01:18:43.741
which means there would
be zero reason to do this fight.

01:18:44.041 --> 01:18:46.043
That's not the case. Keep in
mind.

01:18:46.545 --> 01:18:49.813
Cash's fight against
Evil Fate the Terrible

01:18:49.847 --> 01:18:54.519
did about $2.7 million
buys at $79.95 a buy.

01:18:54.553 --> 01:18:59.423
Now they're estimating that this
bet will do over $6 million buys,

01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:03.227
at $89.95 a pop. Benjamins,
baby.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.096
Yes, Syd, I think you've had a few
too many tokes of Colorado's finest.

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:07.898
Not this morning.

01:19:07.932 --> 01:19:10.768
I will tell you this, every high
school kid will not ask their parents,

01:19:10.801 --> 01:19:14.038
they will demand that
their parents buy this fight.

01:19:14.071 --> 01:19:18.610
The video has already gone
viral. 50 million views.

01:19:18.876 --> 01:19:25.550
Jamie, about that 200 grand,
add a zero.

01:19:33.057 --> 01:19:34.225
You be good for mom.

01:19:39.497 --> 01:19:40.498
I love you, buddy.

01:19:40.764 --> 01:19:42.132
I love you, too.

01:19:42.166 --> 01:19:43.167
Come here.

01:19:51.408 --> 01:19:52.611
I'll be back Sunday morning.

01:19:57.616 --> 01:19:58.583
Will you still be here?

01:20:00.685 --> 01:20:01.686
Come on, Jade.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.123
Cash, I warned you
before we got married.

01:20:06.991 --> 01:20:08.693
Zero tolerance.

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:11.295
We had a contract.

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:15.132
I know. I'm sorry, babe.

01:20:16.934 --> 01:20:19.671
Me too. Kareef?

01:20:20.639 --> 01:20:21.640
Hey, Jade.

01:20:22.273 --> 01:20:23.807
How you doing, little man?

01:20:23.841 --> 01:20:24.842
Kareef.

01:20:28.045 --> 01:20:30.715
Just wait until I get back,
please.

01:20:32.484 --> 01:20:33.485
I love you.

01:20:47.064 --> 01:20:48.132
See you guys.

01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:35.879
What was it like to beat Cash?

01:21:38.082 --> 01:21:39.584
Do you really want to know?

01:21:40.719 --> 01:21:41.952
Yes.

01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:48.892
You're going to find
out soon because

01:21:48.926 --> 01:21:51.128
you're going to beat this guy,
right?

01:21:52.963 --> 01:21:56.568
You must fight smarter,
take emotion out of it, stick to the plan,

01:21:56.601 --> 01:21:57.935
and you will outwit him.

01:21:57.968 --> 01:21:59.103
Yes?

01:21:59.571 --> 01:22:00.572
Yes.

01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:21.793
Hey, is it true the Rock's
coming tomorrow night?

01:22:21.826 --> 01:22:24.928
That'd be sweet.
Any of you guys seen Skyscraper?

01:22:24.962 --> 01:22:27.799
That is a fucking masterpiece
man.

01:22:27.832 --> 01:22:29.933
Feeling good, Cash?

01:22:29.967 --> 01:22:32.936
My balls are in this robe,
big time.

01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:34.972
Cash, do you feel any
remorse for fighting your son?

01:22:35.005 --> 01:22:38.142
Shit no. Every 18-year-old
kid out there deserves

01:22:38.175 --> 01:22:41.412
a good old fashioned ass whooping.
It builds character.

01:22:41.679 --> 01:22:44.214
He's been saying that exact same
line to me since I was three.

01:22:44.248 --> 01:22:46.417
Cash,
the way you're talking to him,

01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:48.820
the fact that you're already
drinking, it only reaffirms-

01:22:48.853 --> 01:22:50.588
- You know what it reaffirms,
honey?

01:22:50.822 --> 01:22:54.258
It reaffirms that I could really
use a handjob right about now.

01:22:54.291 --> 01:22:55.827
Cash, that's sexual harassment.

01:22:56.427 --> 01:22:58.496
Lick me where I shit, Jamie.

01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:01.932
Now that's sexual harassment,
people.

01:23:01.965 --> 01:23:05.703
Hey, in his defense,
the abuse stuff was 10 years ago.

01:23:06.303 --> 01:23:07.371
He paid his dues.

01:23:09.273 --> 01:23:10.274
That doesn't change the fact that
he's an absolute piece of crap,

01:23:10.307 --> 01:23:11.476
so you can feel free to sue his
ass.

01:23:11.509 --> 01:23:13.410
My baby is so sweet, ain't he?

01:23:13.444 --> 01:23:14.813
You won't be thinking
that tomorrow night.

01:23:14.846 --> 01:23:15.979
I can guarantee you that.

01:23:20.852 --> 01:23:22.921
Is Sport going
to give me a licking?

01:23:22.953 --> 01:23:25.590
I could have knocked your sorry
ass out four months ago, chief.

01:23:25.623 --> 01:23:26.990
I don't remember
it going down like that.

01:23:27.024 --> 01:23:28.992
Yes, you don't remember
yesterday.

01:23:29.026 --> 01:23:30.027
This is true.

01:23:31.463 --> 01:23:33.997
Hey, barkeep, get this guy
another Bloody Mary.

01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:36.300
Good idea, Barkeep.
Make it a double.

01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:39.471
Next?

01:23:39.504 --> 01:23:41.305
Come on. Daddy needs shoes.

01:23:43.842 --> 01:23:45.442
No, you won. We won. Yes, go
ahead.

01:23:45.477 --> 01:23:49.213
Take it out. Let me get it.
On a four, on a five, on a six,

01:23:49.514 --> 01:23:52.049
on an eight and throw
all these the hard way,

01:23:52.851 --> 01:23:53.885
Oh boy.

01:23:54.919 --> 01:23:56.420
What the fuck is this?

01:23:56.888 --> 01:23:57.889
Shit.

01:23:57.922 --> 01:23:58.690
Sir, could you please?

01:23:58.723 --> 01:24:02.760
Shit. Sorry, baby. Wow.

01:24:03.227 --> 01:24:08.933
Now, this is some great shit we
got going on in here baby. Right?

01:24:11.903 --> 01:24:13.036
I'm Cash.

01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:15.038
Hi, Cash.
How are you doing? I'm Dan.

01:24:15.072 --> 01:24:16.541
Dan? Tell me, Dan.

01:24:17.274 --> 01:24:20.110
How is it you can see the dice
from all the way down there?

01:24:22.112 --> 01:24:25.048
Cash, go to bed.

01:24:26.016 --> 01:24:29.721
Hey, look at all these
little cute $25 chips, Susie.

01:24:30.588 --> 01:24:33.458
You two want a few bananas?

01:24:33.925 --> 01:24:38.730
I only got about 50 left, but hell,
they ain't doing me any fucking good.

01:24:41.131 --> 01:24:43.100
I think you might
need those for later.

01:24:43.801 --> 01:24:49.941
What? Hey, you got that right.
I do need these.

01:24:52.276 --> 01:24:53.410
Do you want to help me out?

01:24:53.443 --> 01:24:55.112
Because I'm good
but I ain't that good.

01:24:57.214 --> 01:24:58.983
Come here.
Let me tell you something.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.932
Then she went down on.

01:25:14.431 --> 01:25:18.201
Do you believe this?
I liked it. He's good.

01:25:18.235 --> 01:25:20.605
He's okay,
whatever the hell your name is.

01:25:20.638 --> 01:25:21.271
Dan.

01:25:21.305 --> 01:25:24.809
Dan. Oh, cool, man.

01:25:27.177 --> 01:25:30.247
Do you need a ticket or something
for tomorrow night's battle?

01:25:35.787 --> 01:25:37.522
What the fuck
you know about battle?

01:25:54.371 --> 01:25:55.372
Hey, Jett.

01:25:55.807 --> 01:25:56.808
Yes?

01:25:56.841 --> 01:25:58.776
Is "Screw you" bad?

01:26:00.377 --> 01:26:01.378
Yes.

01:26:06.183 --> 01:26:09.554
What about "Anal"?

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.158
Very bad.

01:26:18.161 --> 01:26:19.196
Have a dessert.

01:26:19.998 --> 01:26:21.032
Heck, yes.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.970
Wait, what about my diet?

01:26:26.004 --> 01:26:27.005
No rules tonight.

01:26:28.506 --> 01:26:29.674
All right, you can have as
much dying sugar as you want,

01:26:29.707 --> 01:26:31.009
or you can be up late. Okay?

01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:32.010
Okay.

01:26:32.043 --> 01:26:34.177
We won't fight till 10 o'clock.

01:26:34.211 --> 01:26:37.515
My body peaks at 12,
so I need to sleep late, understand?

01:26:39.383 --> 01:26:42.152
I want two chocolate sundaes
with whipped cream and Skittles.

01:26:42.185 --> 01:26:43.186
Yes.

01:27:09.914 --> 01:27:11.082
This is.

01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:13.350
Ever heard of a neck crank?

01:27:17.055 --> 01:27:18.056
I have not.

01:27:19.557 --> 01:27:21.826
It's the closest thing
one human being can

01:27:21.859 --> 01:27:25.029
do to another before
ripping his head off.

01:27:27.732 --> 01:27:28.733
Sounds fun.

01:27:29.967 --> 01:27:31.301
You're looking for some fun?

01:27:32.202 --> 01:27:34.072
Come on up
to the Presidential Suite.

01:27:37.307 --> 01:27:38.576
Jade not making this trip?

01:27:42.146 --> 01:27:44.048
I think she's leaving me,
sport.

01:27:45.083 --> 01:27:48.285
Oh, good for her.

01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:56.226
It won't last. She will be
back.

01:27:57.995 --> 01:27:58.996
Don't bet on it.

01:28:07.739 --> 01:28:10.074
What's Claude's
grand plan this time?

01:28:12.309 --> 01:28:16.180
I can see you two
butt-fuckers now watching film,

01:28:16.781 --> 01:28:19.951
sipping on some Bordeaux,
talking socialism.

01:28:22.954 --> 01:28:25.089
I'm just glad I finally
figured out the truth.

01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:29.494
The truth, huh, and what's
that?

01:28:31.829 --> 01:28:33.698
That you're just
a really weak person.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:42.540
You're weak when it comes to Jade,
pathetic when it comes to Quinn, mom,

01:28:45.342 --> 01:28:47.512
but maybe your biggest
weakness is yourself.

01:28:50.347 --> 01:28:53.450
I pray I never end up like you.

01:28:54.652 --> 01:28:55.653
You won't.

01:28:57.155 --> 01:28:58.156
Know how I know that?

01:29:01.358 --> 01:29:03.461
Because tomorrow night you die,
Sport.

01:29:05.563 --> 01:29:08.633
Tomorrow night, I kill you.

01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:54.612
Okay.

01:30:15.867 --> 01:30:18.236
, kid.

01:31:04.181 --> 01:31:10.054
Also fighting out of Birmingham with
a record of 38 wins, one defeat,

01:31:10.087 --> 01:31:13.257
the undisputed Lightweight
Champion of the world,

01:31:13.291 --> 01:31:18.296
the undisputed Welterweight
Champion of the world, the Slayer,

01:31:18.329 --> 01:31:23.334
Liquid Cash Boykins.

01:31:25.503 --> 01:31:26.470
Come on, Jett.

01:31:30.007 --> 01:31:31.208
How are we doing?

01:31:31.876 --> 01:31:34.412
Shake up a little, Jett. Shake
up.

01:31:38.115 --> 01:31:41.285
All right, guys, bring it in.
Bring it in, gentlemen.

01:31:41.319 --> 01:31:43.955
Gentlemen, championship fight here.
You both know the rules.

01:31:43.988 --> 01:31:46.390
If you want to touch gloves,
go ahead and do so now.

01:31:47.391 --> 01:31:49.327
All right then, go back to your corners.
Come out on my call.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.329
Cash, quick question.

01:31:51.629 --> 01:31:54.532
My daughter is just done with karate.
Can she be next?

01:31:57.902 --> 01:31:59.503
Go back to your corner.

01:32:06.978 --> 01:32:08.379
Are you ready to go?

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:11.716
- Cash, are you ready to go?
- Let's fight.

01:32:11.749 --> 01:32:13.784
Here we go, Kenny.
Father versus son.

01:32:13.818 --> 01:32:15.720
Man, you could feel
the tension right now.

01:32:15.753 --> 01:32:19.023
Cash comes out strong,
looking for that spinning back kick.

01:32:19.056 --> 01:32:20.591
He's trying to take his head
off.

01:32:22.426 --> 01:32:25.363
Now attacking the body,
trying to slow down Jett.

01:32:25.396 --> 01:32:26.897
Smart strategy.

01:32:26.931 --> 01:32:28.799
Jett needs to use his distance.
That's what he does best.

01:32:28.833 --> 01:32:32.236
It's hard to do it against an
aggressive fighter like Cash though.

01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:41.078
Looking to counter. Nice front
kick.

01:32:48.085 --> 01:32:51.422
The son hits the floor.
He just hit him in the face. Same corner.

01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:53.858
What the fuck are you doing?

01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:55.526
Jett trying to go to the
ground.

01:32:55.559 --> 01:32:57.995
Come on. Get up.

01:32:58.029 --> 01:32:59.063
Cash is not having it.

01:32:59.096 --> 01:32:59.997
Let's go. Get back to your
feet.

01:33:00.031 --> 01:33:01.165
It's a smart thing.

01:33:01.198 --> 01:33:03.200
He knows he has
the advantage on the feet.

01:33:03.234 --> 01:33:04.435
Let's fight.

01:33:04.469 --> 01:33:06.570
He has so much
experience with his striking.

01:33:11.409 --> 01:33:14.445
He's trying to get a little wild.
This is going to favor Cash.

01:33:15.312 --> 01:33:18.483
Big combination there from Cash.
He's rocking.

01:33:26.290 --> 01:33:30.694
Picks him up.
Excellent double-legged takedown.

01:33:30.728 --> 01:33:32.029
This is not good for Jett.

01:33:32.063 --> 01:33:34.298
This is exactly what
happened to the.

01:33:37.001 --> 01:33:38.602
This is a bad spot to be in.

01:33:39.837 --> 01:33:41.439
There's only 10 seconds to go
here.

01:33:41.473 --> 01:33:43.407
Let's see if he can
secure a position.

01:33:43.441 --> 01:33:45.142
He could finish
it here in round one.

01:33:52.283 --> 01:33:55.820
Saved by the bell.
That was a close call.

01:33:57.955 --> 01:33:59.558
A huge round for Cash.

01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:01.493
Tyron, how'd you score
that first round?

01:34:03.327 --> 01:34:05.996
It finished very strong with
the elbows, started off strong.

01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:08.599
I'm going to go with a 10-9.
We will see what the judges say.

01:34:08.632 --> 01:34:11.702
Wow, what a round by Cash.
My goodness.

01:34:12.670 --> 01:34:14.438
Now, listen.
Listen to me carefully.

01:34:15.172 --> 01:34:17.509
Please, don't brawl with this guy.
Don't fight with him.

01:34:17.542 --> 01:34:19.276
Come on, Jett. You got this.

01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:21.312
What does Jett need to do here to
even things up here in round two?

01:34:21.345 --> 01:34:23.747
Well, Jett needs not
to play into Cash's game plan.

01:34:23.781 --> 01:34:26.585
He was trying to scrawl and
brawl by standing in the pocket.

01:34:26.617 --> 01:34:30.321
That's not the game plan.
He needs to use his distance, leg kicks.

01:34:30.354 --> 01:34:31.755
Get in and get out.

01:34:31.789 --> 01:34:35.159
Here, we go. Round two.
Cash coming out strong again.

01:34:35.192 --> 01:34:37.728
Very aggressive.
Trying to back up Jett Boykins.

01:34:38.062 --> 01:34:39.930
Jett has to do a better
job by sticking and moving,

01:34:39.964 --> 01:34:42.366
using the distance,
getting in, and getting out.

01:34:43.667 --> 01:34:45.703
Tyron, to your point,
he just did it right there.

01:34:45.736 --> 01:34:48.973
Excellent lateral movement.
This is what we didn't see in round one.

01:34:55.746 --> 01:34:57.715
Oh my God, judo throw.

01:34:57.748 --> 01:35:00.552
Great reversal there by
Jett Boykins. There's his judo.

01:35:00.585 --> 01:35:03.154
Those are the judo takeouts
we expected to see in round one.

01:35:03.187 --> 01:35:04.722
See if he can limp leg out of
this.

01:35:04.755 --> 01:35:06.390
Cash trying to turn
this into a single-leg

01:35:06.423 --> 01:35:09.126
takedown and Jett
limp-legs out of it.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.194
Back to the feet.

01:35:15.666 --> 01:35:18.969
Much better defense there
from Jett Boykins this time out.

01:35:19.003 --> 01:35:21.540
He's keeping him off balance.
Nice right hand as well.

01:35:27.546 --> 01:35:29.113
Jett has enough against the
cage.

01:35:35.019 --> 01:35:36.854
Needs to get that
space off the fence.

01:35:39.356 --> 01:35:40.958
Great wrist control.

01:35:42.193 --> 01:35:44.862
Beautiful throw.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.935
Nice.

01:35:54.639 --> 01:35:56.707
Not a whole lot of time left
here, Tyron.

01:35:57.808 --> 01:36:01.646
Big kick there by Jett Boykins.

01:36:02.213 --> 01:36:03.981
Yes, baby, yes.

01:36:07.818 --> 01:36:09.119
It goes to the body.

01:36:09.153 --> 01:36:11.623
What an end to the round
there from Jett Boykins.

01:36:11.656 --> 01:36:15.460
You can see his confidence building.
Cash looks very frustrated.

01:36:21.633 --> 01:36:24.603
That's what I'm talking about.
That was beautiful.

01:36:24.636 --> 01:36:27.572
Great. Hey, he went in the corner
and listened to his coaches,

01:36:27.606 --> 01:36:29.206
came out with a brilliant round.

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:32.076
Did stick and move, stole the
cookie, left the crumb behind.

01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:34.445
That's what he has to do.
I call it one to one.

01:36:34.479 --> 01:36:37.214
Keep kicking that leg till
it cannot stand no more,

01:36:37.248 --> 01:36:38.816
and we're going to take
him to the ground.

01:36:38.849 --> 01:36:41.785
Stay focused, stay focused
and go keep kicking that leg.

01:36:42.186 --> 01:36:44.421
Absolutely amazing fight so
far.

01:36:44.455 --> 01:36:46.625
let's what round three
has in store for us.

01:36:50.828 --> 01:36:55.833
Here we go, Tyron.
That's a cheap shot by Cash.

01:36:55.866 --> 01:36:57.636
Of course.
Why wouldn't Cash do that?

01:36:57.669 --> 01:37:02.707
He's known for this.
He's foot-stomping.

01:37:03.642 --> 01:37:06.944
That is not illegal, but that is
not cool here in mixed martial arts.

01:37:12.283 --> 01:37:13.450
A big shot.

01:37:14.018 --> 01:37:16.153
Mr. Referee.

01:37:19.223 --> 01:37:20.324
Keep fighting.

01:37:28.299 --> 01:37:30.034
This is not where Jett wants to
be.

01:37:32.169 --> 01:37:33.538
Come on.

01:37:33.571 --> 01:37:36.474
not able to get control
here.

01:37:43.914 --> 01:37:45.717
He's getting down
very low with his face.

01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:46.884
He's ready for that throw.

01:37:46.917 --> 01:37:50.488
Second bounce.
Cash is driving the cage.

01:37:50.522 --> 01:37:51.889
Stop driving the fence.

01:37:51.922 --> 01:37:53.390
Yes, that's another cheap shot.

01:37:55.092 --> 01:37:57.328
If he turns it into a takedown,
that should be a point deduction.

01:38:01.766 --> 01:38:06.504
This referee is letting Cash get away
with some serious rule-bending here.

01:38:24.188 --> 01:38:28.760
Remember how that feels, boy?

01:38:33.798 --> 01:38:36.801
I made you, bitch.

01:38:44.609 --> 01:38:48.912
Come on, come on.

01:38:55.252 --> 01:38:56.954
Come on.

01:39:01.892 --> 01:39:04.796
That's right, bitch.

01:39:18.142 --> 01:39:23.748
You remember where you came
from.

01:39:37.928 --> 01:39:38.929
Sit down.

01:39:41.031 --> 01:39:42.500
What the hell are you doing?

01:39:42.834 --> 01:39:43.802
Don't fight emotional.

01:39:47.104 --> 01:39:49.674
Hey, listen guys.
Hey, Cash, if you grab the fence

01:39:49.707 --> 01:39:51.910
like that again, I'm going to take
a point away. Do you understand?

01:39:51.942 --> 01:39:53.210
You want to lose this fight?

01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:55.312
So wake up and put
yourself together.

01:39:55.847 --> 01:39:57.749
We're going to go back to the
plan.

01:39:57.782 --> 01:40:00.852
We're going to go back to the kick
and the footwork and stay focused.

01:40:00.885 --> 01:40:02.352
I am not a bitch.

01:40:02.386 --> 01:40:04.455
You stick to the goal, boy.
Relax.

01:40:04.489 --> 01:40:06.591
We're going to take him
to the ground again. Look at me.

01:40:06.624 --> 01:40:09.193
Do you want to win this fight?
Okay, so we focus.

01:40:09.226 --> 01:40:12.996
Keep the distance. Chop down that leg.
We just lost that round.

01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:15.467
Okay, man. You do what you do.
We got this, all right?

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.635
You prepped for this.
Let's go. let's go.

01:40:36.921 --> 01:40:39.691
With Cash top on our scorecards
anyway, two to one,

01:40:39.724 --> 01:40:42.159
Jett Boykins needs
to come out strong.

01:40:55.573 --> 01:40:58.710
Beautiful kick to the head.

01:41:35.947 --> 01:41:40.552
Okay, that's it. Stop right here.
Stop right there. Time out.

01:41:40.585 --> 01:41:41.953
Go to the mutual corner right
there.

01:41:41.986 --> 01:41:43.888
I told you last round,
grab the fence again,

01:41:43.922 --> 01:41:46.791
I'm going to take a point away.
I got to take a point away.

01:41:53.063 --> 01:41:55.767
That's one point deduction.
Red corner. Grabbing the fence.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.003
That is going to help Jett.
Jett will be up in this round here.

01:42:03.575 --> 01:42:04.976
Stay right there.

01:42:05.009 --> 01:42:05.910
All right, guys,
We're going to restart this fight.

01:42:05.944 --> 01:42:07.311
Let's clean it up, gentlemen.

01:42:07.344 --> 01:42:09.581
Are you ready to go?
You ready to go? Let's fight.

01:42:09.614 --> 01:42:11.616
That is going to give
some confidence back

01:42:11.649 --> 01:42:14.117
to Cash as we start
this round again.

01:42:14.151 --> 01:42:16.054
A big knee there.

01:43:11.843 --> 01:43:13.410
Get off me.

01:43:22.185 --> 01:43:23.353
Fuck.

01:43:23.387 --> 01:43:25.222
Go back to your corner.

01:44:27.284 --> 01:44:29.687
This is it right here.
You ready to go?

01:44:29.721 --> 01:44:31.089
You ready to go?

01:44:31.122 --> 01:44:32.355
Let's fight.

01:44:32.389 --> 01:44:33.925
Fifth and final round here.

01:44:33.958 --> 01:44:36.259
Tyron, it's do or die for both
of these men.

01:44:36.293 --> 01:44:37.895
What a combination by Cash.

01:44:45.803 --> 01:44:47.939
Jett's starting to score
some combinations.

01:45:08.826 --> 01:45:12.230
Don't stop with the lyrics,
go to the fucking face!

01:45:12.262 --> 01:45:13.765
Listen to your fucking trainer.

01:45:13.798 --> 01:45:14.999
Come on, finish him.

01:45:15.032 --> 01:45:16.901
Do what he fuckin' tells you
bitch.

01:45:16.934 --> 01:45:17.735
Rip his face.

01:45:17.769 --> 01:45:21.139
Do it. You fucking pussy.

01:45:21.973 --> 01:45:23.340
Stop, stop.

01:46:05.817 --> 01:46:07.819
No.

01:46:14.659 --> 01:46:15.993
No, no, no, no, no.

01:46:16.027 --> 01:46:17.261
He's blocking the referee.

01:46:29.874 --> 01:46:34.245
I hope Jett is okay. This is not
a good moment right now.

01:46:40.383 --> 01:46:42.687
We see very little
movement from Jett right now.

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.021
Jett, get up, man.

01:46:44.055 --> 01:46:45.056
Yes.

01:46:52.296 --> 01:46:53.931
This is a scary moment right
now.

01:46:54.465 --> 01:46:55.233
What's going on?

01:46:56.399 --> 01:46:57.101
Jett.

01:46:57.134 --> 01:46:58.803
Get up, man.

01:46:59.637 --> 01:47:01.404
Hey. Hey, Jett.

01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:06.443
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't allow you...

01:47:06.477 --> 01:47:08.246
Guys, guys, let her in. Let her
in.

01:47:08.279 --> 01:47:14.318
Jett, Jett. Please, Jett.
Please, please.

01:47:14.752 --> 01:47:19.957
Please. Jett, baby, wake up,
please.

01:47:22.827 --> 01:47:25.428
Please, please.

01:47:27.465 --> 01:47:29.033
His eyes, his eyes just moved.

01:47:35.106 --> 01:47:39.844
Jett, are you okay?

01:47:41.979 --> 01:47:43.581
Did I hear a loss?

01:47:45.316 --> 01:47:47.084
Can we get a stretcher, please?

01:47:47.318 --> 01:47:50.054
Hey, Jett, Jett, Jett.
We cannot take any risk.

01:47:50.087 --> 01:47:51.155
No, please. I'm okay.

01:47:51.188 --> 01:47:52.290
Stretcher.

01:47:52.323 --> 01:47:54.825
Mom, mom. I'm fine, tell him.

01:47:54.859 --> 01:48:00.498
I'm fine, mom. Mom, I'm okay.

01:48:12.009 --> 01:48:15.780
I'm ok..

01:48:58.923 --> 01:49:02.059
I'm so proud of you. I'm so
proud.

01:53:12.885 --> 01:53:17.885

www.OpenSubtitles.org

01:53:23.754 --> 01:53:25.789
Take a look around me.

01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:29.326
Taking pages from a magazine,

01:53:30.528 --> 01:53:35.866
been looking for the answer
ever since we were seventeen.

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:42.607
You know the truth can be a weapon to
fight this world of ill intentions,

01:53:43.774 --> 01:53:46.043
a new answer to the same
question,

01:53:46.844 --> 01:53:50.347
how many times will
you learn the same lesson?

01:53:51.683 --> 01:53:53.817
I think they got it all wrong.

01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:36.827
This is what we came for,
and we couldn't want it anymore.

01:54:38.195 --> 01:54:43.702
Could never turn back now,
got to leave it all on the floor.

01:54:44.868 --> 01:54:51.175
Been dreaming of the payoff,
through the struggles and the trade-offs,

01:54:51.208 --> 01:54:55.814
write in truth heading on the
way up, tell them the truth,

01:54:55.846 --> 01:54:58.015
but they think it's just made
up.

01:54:59.751 --> 01:55:01.553
I think they got it all wrong.

01:55:02.886 --> 01:55:08.959
We just got to hold on,
and on, and on, and on

01:55:10.027 --> 01:55:13.397
'cause we're going to be
legends,

01:55:38.889 --> 01:55:41.325
Eventually, they're going to
know who's right.

01:55:41.826 --> 01:55:45.229
To make a stand
you got to win the fight.

01:55:45.262 --> 01:55:49.768
Can't stand the heat, then just
stay out the light for you might

01:55:49.801 --> 01:55:52.537
never make it out alive.

01:55:52.570 --> 01:55:55.807
You gotta live without
the columbines.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:00.911
Let everybody hear your battle
cry.

01:56:14.191 --> 01:56:20.264
Yes, we're going to be legends,
going to get their attention.

01:56:21.031 --> 01:56:24.201
What we're doing
here ain't just scary.

01:56:24.602 --> 01:56:29.507
It's about to be legendary.
We're going to be legends,

01:56:31.308 --> 01:56:33.110
going to teach 'em all a lesson,

01:56:34.712 --> 01:56:37.849
