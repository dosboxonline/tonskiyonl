WEBVTT

00:07.425 --> 00:08.843
You fixed her!

00:09.593 --> 00:10.928
You fix things!

00:14.724 --> 00:16.350
MCRN Fleet Command

00:16.350 --> 00:18.227
recommends that a joint strike force

00:18.227 --> 00:19.687
set out for the Ring
immediately.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.772
I will not commit my forces
to that plan.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.733
My brother
is a dockworker on Ceres.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.569
I just hope he's okay.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.618
It was my call to make,

00:34.618 --> 00:37.204
and I don't owe you
a fucking explanation.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.664
If we're not trying
to win this fight,

00:38.664 --> 00:40.708
I don't know
what I'm doing out here.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.381
I'm so sorry.
What are you sorry for?

00:49.592 --> 00:51.302
And this message
is for the traitor,

00:51.302 --> 00:54.054
coward, Marco Inaros.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.307
At least it wasn't the Inners
who raided our supplies.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.600
Whose side are you on?

00:57.600 --> 01:01.228
Drummer is our enemy.
This is war.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.567
Where are you?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.152
Are you there?

01:08.152 --> 01:09.987
Hello?

01:09.987 --> 01:12.072
Please, you have to help him.

01:13.449 --> 01:17.119
He's my brother. He got hurt.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.788
He died.

01:18.788 --> 01:22.833
But I know you can fix him
like you fixed Momma Bird.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.503
Please, where are you?

01:25.503 --> 01:28.172
I need your help, please.

01:28.172 --> 01:31.342
Please help me.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.220
Where are you?

01:34.220 --> 01:36.138
Cara, where are you?

01:36.138 --> 01:37.723
Cara?

01:37.723 --> 01:39.058
Baby!

01:40.559 --> 01:41.936
Baby!

01:41.936 --> 01:42.937
Are you out there?

01:49.944 --> 01:50.903
Cara?

01:50.903 --> 01:52.404
Baby, we're right here.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.740
Cara?

01:57.326 --> 01:58.619
Baby!

02:01.038 --> 02:02.748
Cara?

02:02.748 --> 02:04.250
Baby!

02:04.250 --> 02:06.544
Baby girl?
Are you out there?

02:08.003 --> 02:09.255
Cara?

02:09.255 --> 02:10.756
Cara!

02:10.756 --> 02:14.009
Cara, where are you?

02:14.009 --> 02:16.679
Cara!
Baby, we're right here.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.975
Cara, where are you?

02:20.975 --> 02:22.643
Baby girl?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.186
Cara?
- Cara?

02:24.186 --> 02:25.646
Cara, we're here.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.022
Are you out there?

02:27.022 --> 02:28.315
Baby!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.526
Cara!

02:30.526 --> 02:32.194
Cara, are you out there?

03:29.001 --> 03:30.502
Xan?

03:41.889 --> 03:44.892
Cara, is that you?

03:48.562 --> 03:51.565
I feel weird.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.067
What happened?

03:55.152 --> 03:58.322
Well, you got hurt,

03:58.322 --> 04:02.993
really hurt, like, uh,
killed hurt.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.829
Oh.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.086
I remember
I was scared.

04:12.086 --> 04:15.798
I heard talking,
but I couldn't see anyone.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.885
What does it mean
to be in substrate?

04:25.182 --> 04:29.269
Everything looks...different.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.484
Never saw that before.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.791
The dogs fixed you.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.747
Ring Comm Relay
in position and active.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.249
Telemetry looks good.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.335
Comms, give me a wide-band.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.628
Wide-band up.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.133
Medina Station,
this is the MCRN.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.676
Your Free Navy sentries
at the Ring

07:05.676 --> 07:07.761
have been eliminated.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.722
Our weapons are now locked
on Medina Station.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.558
And unless you surrender
immediately

07:12.558 --> 07:15.352
and unconditionally,
we will open fire.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.603
Acknowledge.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.859
Torpedoes. Ready all tubes.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.736
Plasma warheads only.
Repeat, plasma only.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.363
No nukes.
Yes, ma'am.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.198
Admiral, we're picking up

07:28.198 --> 07:29.575
multiple plasma discharges

07:29.575 --> 07:31.743
from the surface
of the Ring Station.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.120
From the surface?
What is it?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.496
Not sure yet, ma'am.

07:34.496 --> 07:35.664
Still working on it.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.377
Collision alert!
Multiple incoming!

07:45.132 --> 07:46.675
All ships, emergency eva...

07:49.511 --> 07:51.054
Obviously
we didn't have anything

07:51.054 --> 07:53.056
on board
that would do the trick.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.392
But we were able to salvage
some appropriate hull stock

07:55.392 --> 07:57.769
from the Granicus,
which is en route to us now.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.229
The new frameworks
should be in place

07:59.229 --> 08:00.689
by the time it arrives.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.484
Would you like me to assign
Filip to the detail?

08:06.361 --> 08:09.698
Do as you wish.
It's of no concern to me.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.994
They're calling it my war.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.871
Iapetus is just one station

08:15.871 --> 08:17.539
and an insignificant one
at that.

08:17.539 --> 08:21.293
One is all it takes
to sow doubt.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.337
That is what Drummer
has done.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.297
If enough Belters
support the Inners, then we...

08:25.297 --> 08:26.798
Yes, we could lose,

08:26.798 --> 08:29.509
which is why the only thing
we need to care about now

08:29.509 --> 08:32.054
is getting to Medina.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.597
With 1,300 systems

08:33.597 --> 08:36.183
and hundreds of colonies
under your thumb,

08:36.183 --> 08:37.809
as much metal
as we can mine,

08:37.809 --> 08:40.520
as many shipyards
as we can build,

08:40.520 --> 08:43.440
anyone who wants access to that

08:43.440 --> 08:45.192
will have to ask you.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.949
Drummer raided
a defenseless supply depot.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.910
If she wants to act
like that makes her a hero,

08:54.910 --> 08:57.371
who cares?

09:04.836 --> 09:06.296
Yes.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.382
You're surprised.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.051
What?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.553
Did you think
it wasn't going to work?

09:16.807 --> 09:18.892
This calls for a celebration.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.025
All ships, emergency evasive...

09:31.321 --> 09:33.198
The railgun
is a Martian design,

09:33.198 --> 09:36.243
but it's made out of a metal
we've never seen before.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.869
Marco traded Protomolecule

09:37.869 --> 09:40.205
for Martian gunships
and weapons.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.915
Maybe this was part
of the deal.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.001
I thought the Ring Station
was impenetrable.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.462
How the fuck did they attach
giant railguns to it?

09:47.462 --> 09:49.298
They mounted the guns
on titanium bands

09:49.298 --> 09:51.008
laid right along the surface.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.968
The assembly
holds itself together.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.804
And since the station has
effectively infinite inertia,

09:55.804 --> 09:57.431
it's a perfect emplacement.

10:00.309 --> 10:03.020
Our strike team
took fire from five guns,

10:03.020 --> 10:05.814
but there are probably six.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.190
From these positions,

10:07.190 --> 10:08.442
Inaros can rain hell

10:08.442 --> 10:10.861
on any point
inside the Ring Space.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.363
Jesus.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.115
If Inaros
gets behind the guns,

10:15.115 --> 10:16.575
the farms on Medina
will be able

10:16.575 --> 10:18.660
to provision his forces
indefinitely.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.746
We could send in
a swarm of fast nukes

10:20.746 --> 10:22.080
and blow Medina up.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.042
The last time we detonated
a nuke near the Ring Station,

10:25.042 --> 10:26.376
it powered up
and nearly wiped out

10:26.376 --> 10:27.794
the entire solar system.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.795
We have to stop them

10:28.795 --> 10:30.130
before they get
through the Ring.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.590
Based on the position
of the Pella

10:31.590 --> 10:32.841
when it engaged Rocinante,

10:32.841 --> 10:34.968
there is still time
to intercept them,

10:34.968 --> 10:36.428
but the window's
closing fast.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.305
We have to mobilize now.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.639
Abandon Ceres.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.850
And consign
every soul upon it

10:41.850 --> 10:43.185
to starvation and death?

10:43.185 --> 10:44.353
Free Navy has been

10:44.353 --> 10:46.813
rounding up our nationals
all over the Belt.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.482
We don't owe Ceres
a goddamn thing.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.485
We need to load up every
warship we've got right now,

10:51.485 --> 10:53.904
max-burn to the Ring,
engage, and keep firing

10:53.904 --> 10:55.405
until we run out of bullets.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.366
MCRN Fleet concurs.

10:57.366 --> 11:00.869
We don't have enough ships,
and we're spread too thin.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.704
We can get the job done.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.290
Do you truly believe
the odds are in our favor?

11:06.583 --> 11:07.918
No, ma'am, but...

11:07.918 --> 11:10.504
If we have to send
more people to their death,

11:10.504 --> 11:12.339
the least we can do

11:12.339 --> 11:15.425
is give them a fucking chance
to win.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.559
You'll have
my decision soon.

11:43.954 --> 11:44.955
What?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.791
You seem a bit tired.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.419
Stop mothering me.

11:50.419 --> 11:51.670
Yes, ma'am.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.881
The Martians have been urging

11:54.881 --> 11:57.676
a full-scale assault
on Medina Station

11:57.676 --> 11:59.636
from the moment
we arrived at Ceres

11:59.636 --> 12:02.264
and found it stripped.

12:02.264 --> 12:06.935
They wanted to send a joint
strike force to the Ring.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.187
I refused to go along
with them.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.523
If you had, do you think

12:11.523 --> 12:13.442
it would have changed
the result?

12:13.442 --> 12:15.318
I want to know what you think.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.363
It's not my place
to say.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.659
Have I gone soft?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.578
Was I trying too hard
to be good

12:24.578 --> 12:26.788
when I should have been
ruthless?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.498
You used your best judgment.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.208
And lost.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.502
There is no prize
for the best victim.

12:37.132 --> 12:40.051
Your torpedo picked
a rotten time to misfire.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.889
I'm not blaming you.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.724
It was just bad luck.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.434
The fight's not over yet.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.894
I don't need platitudes.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.896
We're fucked,
and it's my fault.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.439
Fine.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.524
Maybe you have gone
a bit soft,

12:54.524 --> 12:57.027
which might not be so bad
in small doses,

12:57.027 --> 12:59.863
but now is not the time
for self-pity bullshit.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.948
It's time to keep your eyes
on the enemy

13:01.948 --> 13:03.909
and wait for the next time
they slip up,

13:03.909 --> 13:05.994
because I still think
we're the good guys,

13:05.994 --> 13:07.996
and I'd rather do
a little less soul-searching

13:07.996 --> 13:09.873
and a lot more fighting back.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.464
Go do something else.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.063
The UNN engineer said

13:33.063 --> 13:34.606
that they've been ordered
to reinforce our hull

13:34.606 --> 13:37.192
with carbon silicate
lace plating.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.902
What's that?

13:38.902 --> 13:41.321
Some kind of badass new armor.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.533
They said it's the same stuff
they've got on UNN-One.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.117
If it makes us harder
to poke holes into,

13:46.117 --> 13:47.536
I'm all for it.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.497
It reminded me of my father.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.833
The lace plating
is new metallurgy.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.961
It came out
of Protomolecule research.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.421
The things my father did,

13:58.421 --> 13:59.798
he tried to justify them

13:59.798 --> 14:02.217
by saying the Protomolecule
was the key

14:02.217 --> 14:05.762
to ensuring
the survival of our species.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.807
Stuff like this
makes him seem right.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.145
What the hell is Amos
still doing out there?

14:14.145 --> 14:15.855
Oh, he's not out there.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.232
He went into the station.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.108
Why?

14:18.108 --> 14:19.192
He didn't say.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.902
Do you know
when he'll be back?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.447
He didn't say.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.824
Watch your step.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.119
Based on the data,
it seems clear to me

14:29.119 --> 14:31.663
that a significant number
of these ship disappearances

14:31.663 --> 14:34.416
were indeed similar to whatever
happened to the Barkeith.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.919
The Ring transit data that
my group was able to study,

14:37.919 --> 14:39.504
and there was a lot,

14:39.504 --> 14:43.258
suggests that there is
a mass-energy threshold

14:43.258 --> 14:47.137
which precedes or perhaps
triggers these events,

14:47.137 --> 14:49.389
which obviously would have
dire consequences

14:49.389 --> 14:51.349
for the future use
of the Rings.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.852
I've embedded our analysis
for you to see.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.817
You were right.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.652
Anytime anyone
goes through a Ring,

15:02.652 --> 15:04.946
they don't realize
they're taking a massive risk.

15:07.282 --> 15:10.368
You said that every time
you transit,

15:10.368 --> 15:14.122
you can feel those entities
getting angrier.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.915
Do you think
they're trying to get out?

15:17.375 --> 15:20.629
Uh, I don't know. Maybe.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.047
The artifact on Ilus

15:22.047 --> 15:24.591
proves they can
directly affect our world.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.637
Avasarala needs to see this.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.513
This is bigger than the war.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.266
Something funny?

15:33.266 --> 15:36.353
No...something good.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.204
The supplies
are solely food and fuel

15:54.204 --> 15:55.830
to help relieve the station.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.375
We are giving it to you.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.001
That doesn't
make any difference.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.920
A UNN crew will board
each of your ships

16:01.920 --> 16:03.630
and pilot them in
and conduct a...

16:03.630 --> 16:05.632
Your soldiers on my ships?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.717
And conduct
a thorough security screening.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.344
Any Free Navy partisans

16:09.344 --> 16:10.679
or Belters
with outstanding warrants

16:10.679 --> 16:11.930
will be immediately detained.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.807
So it is the Inners' policy

16:13.807 --> 16:15.892
to starve the Belt, again.

16:15.892 --> 16:18.144
If you do not submit
to these procedures,

16:18.144 --> 16:19.187
we will not let you...

16:20.188 --> 16:21.981
Captain Drummer.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.151
Secretary-General.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.820
We are grateful
for your assistance.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.905
Your ships are clear to dock

16:28.905 --> 16:31.950
and will be treated
as sovereign territory.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.327
Your crews are also welcome
on the station,

16:34.327 --> 16:37.330
as long as there are
no disruptions.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.790
We will be staying
only long enough

16:38.790 --> 16:40.291
to unload the supplies.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.294
There will be no disruptions.

16:43.294 --> 16:46.214
It's nice to finally meet.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.675
Fred Johnson
spoke well of you.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.052
He spoke well of you too.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.887
We didn't agree on everything.

16:52.887 --> 16:56.057
Then your gesture
says even more about you

16:56.057 --> 16:58.268
and of the true OPA.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.020
Inaros is an enemy to us both.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.897
A century of oppression

17:02.897 --> 17:05.442
made Marco Inaros inevitable.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.527
If not him,
there would have been another.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.988
Interesting perspective.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.282
I'd like to hear more.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.659
Perhaps in person?

17:14.659 --> 17:17.245
I would be happy to offer
the hospitality of my ship.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.372
The Belters here are hungry,
and I have food.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.625
I came for them, not you.

17:39.309 --> 17:42.604
The Dusters were
taken completely by surprise,

17:42.604 --> 17:46.274
and under the withering fire
of our new railguns,

17:46.274 --> 17:51.070
every last one of their ships
was annihilated.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.657
To celebrate our victory,
the captain has ordered

17:54.657 --> 17:57.368
that all of the rare
Earther brandy

17:57.368 --> 17:59.662
we liberated from Ceres Station

17:59.662 --> 18:04.334
be made available to the crew
at the end of our next shift.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.131
Marco! Marco! Marco!

18:10.131 --> 18:12.467
Marco! Marco!

18:15.136 --> 18:17.722
Oye, mi Pascal.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.641
We double-time
this shift, keyá?

18:19.641 --> 18:21.726
Faster we finish,
faster we get to drink.

18:21.726 --> 18:22.852
Where's Tadeo?

18:22.852 --> 18:25.730
Oh, in the brig.
Mi replace him.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.315
Come on, let's go.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.833
What are you doing here?

18:44.833 --> 18:46.501
What did you do?

18:47.919 --> 18:50.088
I couldn't stop thinking
about my brother.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.092
There was no mention of him
on the newsfeed,

18:54.092 --> 18:56.678
which was good, but still.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.765
So I rigged a transmitter
and I sent him a message.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.268
You broke radio silence.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.186
Just one quick burst.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.814
You could've given away
our position.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.983
You're lucky
that they didn't space you.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.401
I...I wasn't
thinking about me.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.361
I was going crazy.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.989
I just...

19:15.989 --> 19:18.449
needed to know
that Mas was okay.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.660
He was always there for me.

19:36.634 --> 19:37.552
Do this.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.183
That hurt?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.228
On a scale of one to ten.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.813
Four.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.149
This is less useful if you lie.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.905
Eight.
And this?

19:58.740 --> 20:00.992
I had to regrow my spine.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.494
He is having more pain
than I did.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.246
Looks like
the gel was too weak.

20:05.246 --> 20:08.625
Bad batch, maybe, or some
problems with his genetics.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.919
Maybe your Inner friends
could give us some of the gel.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.503
I will not beg favors
from them.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.088
There's no harm in asking.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.381
It wouldn't make
a difference at this point.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.674
That limb will never be good.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.927
It must be removed
as soon as possible.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.764
We will get you
the best prosthetic made.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.183
He will need something
to control the pain until then.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.392
Better not to.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.894
The bad re-grow
will compensate,

20:27.894 --> 20:30.563
make more nerve fiber,
make the pain even worse.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.357
How long before
I pull my own weight again?

20:32.357 --> 20:33.816
The arm will come off quick.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.818
But the bad tissue
must then be rooted out,

20:35.818 --> 20:37.737
all invasive nerve fiber
be killed,

20:37.737 --> 20:40.031
and then must fit
and integrate the prosthetics.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.741
But even in normal times,
it will take weeks.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.160
These are not normal times.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.037
Goddamn Inyalowda
ration everything now,

20:46.037 --> 20:48.247
including surgery.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.166
But for Camina Drummer
and family...

20:53.670 --> 20:56.631
...here's my clinic in Midtown,
outside Green Zone.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.800
Come, and it will be done.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.168
Camina.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.338
I can't believe
how long it's been

21:37.338 --> 21:41.134
since we've actually
spoken to each other.

21:41.134 --> 21:45.513
And...now we can
do it in person.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.767
I'm here with the Roci
on Ceres.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.230
I'm sure you're caught up
in the relief efforts.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.819
It's...amazing what you did.

22:01.237 --> 22:05.241
Oh, there's so much
I want to say.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.578
Just let me know
when you have a little time,

22:08.578 --> 22:10.830
and I'll come to you.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.331
See you soon.

22:20.298 --> 22:21.799
We got some information

22:21.799 --> 22:24.010
from a Belter on Ganymede.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.637
Not a spy.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.849
Regular man, the botanist.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.392
He risked his life and family

22:31.392 --> 22:33.936
to send us
experimental biotech,

22:33.936 --> 22:36.689
simply because he believed
it could help restore

22:36.689 --> 22:39.567
Earth's ability
to grow food.

22:41.652 --> 22:42.820
And?

22:44.822 --> 22:47.700
Initial reports suggest
he might be right.

22:49.160 --> 22:53.039
Well, one good apple,
sometimes that's all it takes.

22:54.624 --> 22:57.710
Madam, he's here.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.212
Just a moment.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.134
People are responding well

23:05.134 --> 23:07.011
to the "Lucky Earther" piece.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.430
Owain's also getting
death threats.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.686
It's just a stimulant.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.898
This is no time to worry
about the swim back.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.365
Send him in.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.202
Monica.
Holden.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.787
I heard you had
some interesting times

23:32.787 --> 23:34.914
out there, as usual.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.332
We should set up an interview.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.793
Never, ever, ever again.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.008
Thank you for seeing me
so quickly.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.301
I know you've got
a lot going on.

23:47.301 --> 23:50.805
You rarely waste my time.
One of the few.

23:50.805 --> 23:52.265
What's on your mind?

23:52.265 --> 23:54.934
Travel through the Rings
is not as safe as we thought.

23:56.519 --> 23:59.939
When traffic exceeds a certain
mass-energy threshold,

23:59.939 --> 24:02.900
a ship will disappear
in transit.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.154
Abruptly vanish
without a trace.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.947
It's connected to the artifact
we discovered on Ilus,

24:07.947 --> 24:09.740
and it's happened
a number of times.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.118
I think I need
to up my dosage.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.244
What?

24:13.244 --> 24:14.704
Never mind.

24:14.704 --> 24:16.539
What can we do about this?

24:19.375 --> 24:21.669
I think we need
to share it with Inaros.

24:21.669 --> 24:24.088
Oh, James,
you're truly one of a kind.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.381
Just hear me out.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.591
If we can convince Marco

24:26.591 --> 24:28.134
that the danger is real,
he might...

24:28.134 --> 24:31.721
What, lay down his arms
and say, "You're right.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.472
Let's solve this together.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.475
We're one big happy family
after all"?

24:36.475 --> 24:40.021
You have to be the most naive
person I've ever met.

24:40.021 --> 24:42.857
Every time anyone uses a Ring,

24:42.857 --> 24:45.067
it puts all of us at risk,

24:45.067 --> 24:47.403
including the colonies
and the trade routes.

24:47.403 --> 24:50.323
And that problem
is not just gonna go away.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.743
Let me show you
the problem we have right now.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.459
Those look like railguns.

25:01.459 --> 25:02.960
Yes, they are.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.670
Very big ones.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.298
They destroyed
six Martian warships

25:07.298 --> 25:09.133
in a matter of seconds.

25:09.133 --> 25:12.803
We cannot afford the luxury
of worrying about the future

25:12.803 --> 25:15.306
until we end this war.

25:19.518 --> 25:23.105
Camina Drummer,
how well do you know her?

25:23.105 --> 25:25.233
What do you want
with Drummer?

25:25.233 --> 25:27.401
I need an ally,

25:27.401 --> 25:30.905
a Belter with ships and guns

25:30.905 --> 25:33.282
who's respected
by her own kind,

25:33.282 --> 25:35.618
to fight at our side
against Inaros.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.536
No wonder you saw me
so quickly.

25:37.536 --> 25:41.290
We need Drummer's strength.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.625
It's really that bad?

25:42.625 --> 25:45.378
We've lost more ships
than we could afford.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.965
Not long ago, Drummer
was a fugitive with one ship.

25:48.965 --> 25:53.970
She came to Ceres with eight,
studded with missiles and guns.

25:53.970 --> 25:57.556
Belters trust her.
Some will flock to her.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.809
And some will abandon
the Free Navy.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.686
That could make
all the difference.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.521
Drummer has no love for Marco,

26:03.521 --> 26:04.939
but she's no friend
of Earth either,

26:04.939 --> 26:06.774
and she's not gonna trust you.

26:11.696 --> 26:15.908
On Earth, I once
put a Belter up on hooks...

26:17.410 --> 26:20.496
...to suffocate him,

26:20.496 --> 26:24.375
to make him tell me things
he wouldn't have otherwise.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.586
I did it because I could.

26:30.423 --> 26:33.217
The Belt sees me that way

26:33.217 --> 26:35.845
because that is who I was.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.767
It is not who I am now.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.699
On my tab.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.458
Someone's got
a bad case of shore leave.

27:07.251 --> 27:08.711
Give me some of that.

27:15.343 --> 27:17.928
You've got lipstick
and scratches on your neck.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.055
Yup.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.224
And is that glitter?

27:23.309 --> 27:24.810
Yup.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.687
So just drinking and fucking.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.067
Till they run out
of one or the other.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.738
You?

27:35.738 --> 27:37.990
Trying to forget
how much I hate politics.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.998
The old lady's trying to win
the game with a crap hand.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.336
You think we're gonna lose?

27:50.336 --> 27:53.881
We can't lose,
not really.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.133
But I don't think
we can win either.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.885
Our grandchildren will still
be killing each other

27:57.885 --> 28:00.137
over this shit
a hundred years from now.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.185
Might be time
you got back to your ship.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.942
I'm not sure
I'm going back.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.528
You serious?

28:17.363 --> 28:20.282
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing out here anymore.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.076
We're fighting a war.

28:22.076 --> 28:24.245
Are we?

28:24.245 --> 28:25.746
'Cause war is when you try

28:25.746 --> 28:27.623
to kill the other guy
when you get the chance.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.542
We caught a bad break
with Inaros.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.960
It happens.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.296
It happened because
Holden disarmed the nuke.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.259
He saw Naomi's kid
on the Pella.

28:45.266 --> 28:47.101
I don't know, usually I get
what he's trying to do,

28:47.101 --> 28:48.519
but this?

28:48.519 --> 28:52.106
Sometimes it feels like
he's trying to get us killed.

28:53.774 --> 28:56.068
Then a couple times,
he saved the whole human race,

28:56.068 --> 28:57.611
so I guess it balances out.

28:57.611 --> 29:00.156
Not a man
who does things by degrees.

29:01.991 --> 29:04.660
War is the wrong place
for good men.

29:06.579 --> 29:10.374
Good or bad, it's the same
place for everyone.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.794
Firing line. Drop ship.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.129
Sitting in a crash couch,

29:15.129 --> 29:17.673
wondering if you'll live
long enough to unstrap.

29:18.507 --> 29:19.592
Then what difference
does it make

29:19.592 --> 29:22.428
if you're good or bad, then?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.305
Well, when you're
in the shit, not much.

29:25.890 --> 29:29.518
But I mean,
I fought for my planet.

29:29.518 --> 29:32.062
I fought for money.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.773
Was a time I would have said
I fought for honor.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.988
In the end, the only thing
that matters

29:40.988 --> 29:43.949
is fighting
for who's covering your flank.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.453
Doesn't matter if they're
saints or assholes.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.830
They're your people.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.582
They watch your back
and you watch theirs,

29:51.582 --> 29:53.167
or you've got nothing.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.966
Yeah.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.426
That's right.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.644
So back to the ship?

30:16.857 --> 30:18.067
Yeah.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.362
Brothel first, though.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.119
You want to come with?

30:29.119 --> 30:30.162
With you?

30:31.038 --> 30:32.748
Or with you?

30:33.624 --> 30:34.792
Whatever.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.512
So...

30:48.389 --> 30:50.140
...that was the easy part.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.893
Doctors are expert liars.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.653
I'm sorry.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.993
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.373
The fight is not over.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.669
And I can't help you.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.437
I will stay here
with him.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.565
We can take shifts.

31:39.565 --> 31:40.733
No.

31:42.026 --> 31:44.570
Camina...

31:44.570 --> 31:47.531
I'm going
to stay here with Josep

31:47.531 --> 31:49.700
on Ceres.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.201
It's okay for you to go.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.412
The Inners
control this station.

31:55.164 --> 31:58.751
I will live
under the Inners' yoke,

31:58.751 --> 32:02.546
and I will help Josep
find a way to also.

32:02.546 --> 32:06.091
Because I know
you will never be able

32:06.091 --> 32:08.761
to give up the fight
with Marco now.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.765
And we can't help you
in that fight anymore.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.144
It's okay.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.439
You can go.

32:26.195 --> 32:28.739
I never loved you
because you were fighters.

32:28.739 --> 32:32.368
I loved you
because you were builders.

32:32.368 --> 32:36.955
I wanted us
to build something together.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.524
Thank you, Bosmang.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.651
Yam seng.

33:10.114 --> 33:12.574
So what's the verdict?

33:12.574 --> 33:15.786
They have size.
We have numbers.

33:15.786 --> 33:16.954
No matter what they do now,

33:16.954 --> 33:19.373
they can't engage us
everywhere at once.

33:19.373 --> 33:23.460
We can dictate
how the forces will be spread.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.878
The stage is set.

33:24.878 --> 33:25.921
That sounds good.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.589
It is good.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.228
Was your father big
in your life?

33:41.228 --> 33:42.938
I never knew him.

33:45.149 --> 33:47.901
So you improved upon the role.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.029
Not as much as I hoped.

33:53.157 --> 33:57.161
Here, there's something
I want you to see.

33:57.161 --> 33:59.538
Camina Drummer
did this to you.

33:59.538 --> 34:04.042
Live shamed and die empty.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.502
At least it wasn't the Inners

34:05.502 --> 34:06.754
who raided our supplies.

34:06.754 --> 34:08.172
Whose side are you on?

34:08.172 --> 34:09.214
I only meant...

34:09.214 --> 34:10.591
Drummer is our enemy.

34:10.591 --> 34:12.551
Same as the Inners

34:12.551 --> 34:15.888
and anyone else
who stands against us.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.807
This is war.

34:18.807 --> 34:22.144
And it won't be over until
we are dead or victorious.

34:22.144 --> 34:25.022
Or else everything
that we fought for,

34:25.022 --> 34:29.902
the blood that we spilled,
the beratnas we lost,

34:29.902 --> 34:31.612
all will have been for nothing.

34:31.612 --> 34:34.698
There is no turning back now.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.622
It was nice to see
that kind of fire in him.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.170
I wonder
where he gets it from.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.250
You should be celebrating
with everyone else,

35:26.250 --> 35:28.252
not wasting your time
with me.

35:33.090 --> 35:37.219
I still have privileged access
to the ship systems.

35:37.219 --> 35:40.264
I piggybacked a comm test
to ping the Ceres network.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.977
See if I could find anything
about your brother.

35:46.937 --> 35:49.314
Mas was on the docks
when the water tanks exploded.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.486
He's dead.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.540
- It's my fault.
- No, it's the Inners' fault.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.292
No.

36:08.292 --> 36:09.918
They occupied the station.
Their soldiers...

36:09.918 --> 36:11.628
No, I killed him.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.507
I was on the crew

36:15.507 --> 36:18.927
that planted the bombs
and rigged the docks to blow.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.526
They said no Belters
would get hurt.

36:36.486 --> 36:39.323
I thought we were
just killing Inners.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.422
Admission to the Green Zone

36:55.422 --> 36:58.967
requires a valid permit,
and all Belters must submit

36:58.967 --> 37:02.012
to ID verification
and security scan.

37:02.012 --> 37:04.723
If you resist,
you will be arrested.

You there.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.329
Are you talking to me?

37:27.329 --> 37:29.790
Yeah, you're Drummer.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.041
And what of it?

37:31.041 --> 37:33.043
You can go right on through.
You're precleared.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.382
There's no need.
I will wait my turn.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.635
Don't waste your time
on this.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.679
You have more important
things to do.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.982
Drummer, how does it feel

37:54.982 --> 37:56.733
to be the Inners'
favorite pet?

37:56.733 --> 37:58.568
Back in line.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.079
Camina.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.335
Nagata.

38:17.838 --> 38:21.925
I'm sorry to just drop in
on you like this.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.970
I-I know you've had
your hands full

38:24.970 --> 38:26.638
with the relief efforts.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.182
It has kept me
quite occupied.

38:30.517 --> 38:31.810
My apologies.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.730
No need.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.525
It's good to see you.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.527
You as well.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.124
Please.

39:21.318 --> 39:22.903
You have a fine ship.

39:24.821 --> 39:28.450
I've kept it the same
as Ashford left it

39:28.450 --> 39:31.036
as much as I could,

39:31.036 --> 39:32.913
Considering what it's been through.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.710
It suits you.

39:45.717 --> 39:49.262
I'm eager to meet your family,
if you have the time.

39:49.262 --> 39:51.014
They're gone.

39:51.014 --> 39:52.099
Gone.

39:53.809 --> 39:54.976
You mean...

39:54.976 --> 39:56.895
Oksana and Bertold
left after I turned on Marco

39:56.895 --> 39:58.605
to save the Rocinante.

39:58.605 --> 40:02.067
Serge was executed in reprisal.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.736
Josep and Michio have decided
to remain on Ceres

40:04.736 --> 40:05.946
so they don't have
to keep paying

40:05.946 --> 40:07.572
for the choices
I made for them.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.621
You blame me
for all that?

40:14.621 --> 40:16.414
I did what I did.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.791
The fault is mine.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.461
We have all lost
a great deal.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.713
Some more than others.

40:23.713 --> 40:26.508
So your pain
is greater than mine?

40:26.508 --> 40:28.260
I was not saying that.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.346
You know it's the last thing
I ever would have wanted.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.389
I didn't tell you about it

40:32.389 --> 40:34.391
because what good
would it have done?

40:36.309 --> 40:37.936
I'm sorry...

40:39.479 --> 40:41.189
...from the bottom
of my heart.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.275
Don't. Please don't.

40:49.156 --> 40:51.449
You didn't come here
to apologize.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.203
Then why did you come?

40:55.203 --> 40:57.080
I wanted to see you.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.206
You know me well enough
to know that silence

40:58.206 --> 40:59.791
meant I didn't want to be seen.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.253
So why are you here?

41:05.672 --> 41:09.801
Holden asked me to talk to you
on Avasarala's behalf.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.428
She wants you and yours

41:11.428 --> 41:14.764
to fight at her side
against Marco.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.355
You should leave.

41:22.355 --> 41:24.608
Camina, please.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.484
Clear this deck!

41:35.869 --> 41:39.164
You come to me,
running errands for the Inners.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.957
It's not like that,
and you know it.

41:40.957 --> 41:43.043
- How do you do it?
- Do what?

41:43.043 --> 41:45.170
Work with them.
Live with them.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.923
Pick their side
against your own over and over.

41:47.923 --> 41:49.799
I picked my own side.

41:49.799 --> 41:53.803
I despise Marco
and everything he's done.

41:53.803 --> 41:56.264
Avasarala and her Inners
are no better.

41:56.264 --> 41:59.392
That was true once,
but it's different now.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.485
So what is it for me?

42:10.445 --> 42:11.905
I can choose to wait
for the bounty

42:11.905 --> 42:14.950
to go high enough
that someone kills me,

42:14.950 --> 42:16.660
or I can put a collar
on my neck

42:16.660 --> 42:18.620
and hand the Inners the leash.

42:21.623 --> 42:23.917
This universe
has no place for me.

42:26.336 --> 42:29.005
I wish there were
another way.

42:29.005 --> 42:32.092
I tried to find one,
but there isn't.

42:33.802 --> 42:36.429
Then we have
to make one.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.265
Tell me how.

42:39.641 --> 42:42.394
Tell me, and we will help.

42:42.394 --> 42:43.687
I don't know how.

42:44.771 --> 42:47.399
Then all we can do now

42:47.399 --> 42:49.734
is to stand
by the people that we love.

42:51.111 --> 42:52.570
What else is there?

42:54.281 --> 42:55.865
Fuck you...

42:57.659 --> 43:00.745
...you self-righteous shit.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.670
Fuck you.

43:11.131 --> 43:13.967
Fuck you. Fuck you.

43:27.314 --> 43:28.690
Advance team confirms.

43:28.690 --> 43:31.276
All units in place.
The route is secure.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.820
Copy that, Advance.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.740
Archangel is in the dock.

43:55.508 --> 43:57.010
And here I am.

44:03.433 --> 44:06.561
I didn't really believe
that you would leave your ship.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.065
Would you have come to me?

44:10.065 --> 44:11.900
Hmm.

44:13.693 --> 44:15.111
Your security detail

44:15.111 --> 44:18.114
doesn't seem too happy
about it.

44:18.114 --> 44:19.491
They don't appreciate

44:19.491 --> 44:22.160
the value of a symbol
as much as I do.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.745
Then this is just symbolism?

44:23.745 --> 44:25.622
I hope not.

44:25.622 --> 44:29.501
I hope it's a way forward
for us both.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.836
The system is filled
with the graves of Belters

44:31.836 --> 44:34.631
who trusted Inners.

44:34.631 --> 44:36.508
And my planet is now covered

44:36.508 --> 44:40.428
with the bodies of people
who paid the price for that.

44:40.428 --> 44:41.638
Why are you here?

44:41.638 --> 44:42.889
Speak plainly.

44:42.889 --> 44:45.892
Marco will get
many more Belters killed

44:45.892 --> 44:47.685
before this ends.

44:47.685 --> 44:50.397
- You know that.
- So you're here to save us?

44:50.397 --> 44:53.566
I'm here because you can
help me win this war.

44:53.566 --> 44:55.402
The sooner it's done,

44:55.402 --> 45:00.073
the fewer the dead
of both our people.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.745
When the last shot is fired,

45:05.745 --> 45:08.665
when Marco is dead,

45:08.665 --> 45:10.708
will you remember us?

45:10.708 --> 45:15.213
Will you remember the Belters
who bled for your victory?

45:15.213 --> 45:18.591
All I can do
is promise that I will.

45:18.591 --> 45:22.846
I have given your people
many reasons to hate me

45:22.846 --> 45:27.016
but none to think
I'm a liar.

45:27.016 --> 45:30.145
Belters fighting
alongside Inners

45:30.145 --> 45:31.813
against Belters.

45:33.189 --> 45:35.191
I never thought
I would live to see that.

45:35.191 --> 45:37.277
Neither did I.

45:38.403 --> 45:41.072
My people will not
take orders from you.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.783
I don't expect them to.
