You know he's not gonna be happy.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.416
[man] No, I suspect he won't.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.833
Only you can decide
what's best for you, Jesse.

00:54.791 --> 00:56.166
Not him, not me.

01:01.958 --> 01:02.958
I'm out.

01:09.916 --> 01:11.833
So, what are you gonna do
with all that money?

01:14.125 --> 01:16.250
Same thing I do with all the other money.

01:16.625 --> 01:19.375
How about you, teenage retiree?

01:19.708 --> 01:21.333
You'll be living the dream.

01:21.416 --> 01:22.291
[chuckles]

01:23.916 --> 01:26.208
Not sure I should stick around town.

01:27.166 --> 01:28.458
That's a start.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.833
Nothing really keeping me here.

01:33.375 --> 01:34.500
Where would you go?

01:35.500 --> 01:36.583
If you were me.

01:37.208 --> 01:40.125
-[Mike] Doesn't matter. I'm not you.
-[Jesse] Seriously, come on.

01:40.208 --> 01:41.666
Like, if you were my age.

01:42.708 --> 01:43.666
Just play along.

01:43.958 --> 01:45.208
Make some conversation.

01:47.416 --> 01:48.458
Alaska.

01:50.291 --> 01:51.166
Yeah?

01:52.125 --> 01:54.583
Yeah, if I were your age, starting fresh,

01:55.583 --> 01:56.541
Alaska.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.000
It's the last frontier.

02:00.041 --> 02:01.958
Up there, you could be anything you want.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.041
[Jesse] Alaska.

02:07.750 --> 02:08.625
Start over.

02:10.125 --> 02:12.166
-Start fresh.
-[Mike] One could.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.500
Put things right.

02:17.666 --> 02:18.541
[Mike] No.

02:21.416 --> 02:23.958
Sorry, kid, that's the one thing
you can never do.

This thing's, like, defective and shit.

It's a bad carpenter
that blames his hammer, yo.

03:42.791 --> 03:43.708
Whatever.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.500
You're apexing too early.
You're apexing too early.

03:46.583 --> 03:50.250
I'm apexing at the apex, bitch.
Don't be telling me how to drive and shit.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.625
[scoffs]
You couldn't drive a two-button elevator.

03:53.041 --> 03:54.583
You couldn't drive Miss Daisy.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.500
Whatever that means.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.041
You couldn't drive a short bus
full of slow kids to the zoo.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.458
Yeah, because I'd be
too distracted by you.

04:02.541 --> 04:04.541
You'd be sitting up front,
in your special helmet,

04:04.625 --> 04:05.916
trying to hump my leg.

04:06.625 --> 04:10.500
On account you couldn't drive
Thelma and Louise off of that cliff. Apex!

04:10.583 --> 04:13.000
I can't apex more
than I'm already apexing.

04:13.125 --> 04:16.166
[sighs]
You drive like a blind guy with no legs.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.625
Dude, you--
you drive like my dead grandmoms.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.083
That's disrespectful.

05:10.916 --> 05:12.166
[door creaks]

I ain't watching no TV right now.

15:48.666 --> 15:49.916
Right on, even better.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.125
Leave it near the border.

15:51.208 --> 15:52.166
Hide it, kind of,

15:52.250 --> 15:55.000
but, yo, don't hide it so good
the cops can't find it.

1:00:24.916 --> 1:00:25.750
Hello?

1:00:28.750 --> 1:00:30.916
Detectives? Everything okay?

1:00:31.666 --> 1:00:33.166
[door opens]

1:00:33.958 --> 1:00:36.333
Uh, sorry about that, sir. We're...

1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:40.791
dusting for fingerprints, you know?
It's a delicate process.

1:00:40.875 --> 1:00:42.750
I thought your CSI boys do that.

1:00:42.833 --> 1:00:44.625
Didn't they get 'em all yesterday?

1:00:44.916 --> 1:00:48.625
Yeah, well, you know, sometimes,
you want something done right--

1:00:48.708 --> 1:00:50.291
Oh, God, tell me about it.

1:00:50.375 --> 1:00:53.125
My line was restaurant
and hospitality supplies,

1:00:53.208 --> 1:00:54.708
so I completely get it.

1:00:55.166 --> 1:00:59.375
Hey, listen, I just came across
an old note Todd Alquist wrote me.

1:00:59.458 --> 1:01:01.458
-Figured it may be of interest.
-Oh, really?

1:01:01.541 --> 1:01:02.375
Yeah.

1:01:02.583 --> 1:01:05.750
Sort of a half-assed apology
he slipped under my door.

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:09.041
I'd gone to our landlord
about this stupid truck cap of his

1:01:09.125 --> 1:01:11.083
everybody kept tripping over, and--

1:01:11.791 --> 1:01:15.916
Well, anyway, if you need
a handwriting sample for analysis.

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.208
That's-- Yeah, yeah, that could be...

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:20.125
-Yeah, sure.
-Left it inside.

1:01:20.208 --> 1:01:23.083
Didn't want to touch it,
speaking of fingerprints.

1:01:23.666 --> 1:01:25.416
You're welcome to come examine it.

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:29.750
Oh, it's no trouble. I got time.

1:01:41.166 --> 1:01:43.250
Show me the money, I let you go.

1:01:46.208 --> 1:01:47.041
Hey.

1:01:47.583 --> 1:01:49.000
What do you say, huh?

1:01:49.625 --> 1:01:50.875
Seems pretty fair to me.

1:01:52.416 --> 1:01:53.625
[thuds]

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:08.500
[quietly grunting]

1:02:17.166 --> 1:02:19.125
Oh, shit!

1:02:19.875 --> 1:02:22.291
-Holy shit!
-Keep your voice down.

1:02:22.375 --> 1:02:24.458
[groans] God, there's gotta be...

1:02:25.208 --> 1:02:27.750
there's gotta be a million here. Yeah.

1:02:32.083 --> 1:02:32.958
[grunts]

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:38.208
What are you doing?

1:02:40.541 --> 1:02:42.583
-Taking my half.
-[Neil] Wow.

1:02:42.666 --> 1:02:44.333
[chuckling] Yeah?

1:02:45.083 --> 1:02:47.541
A little man with big dreams? Yeah?

1:02:47.958 --> 1:02:49.666
Hey, if I were you,

1:02:50.333 --> 1:02:52.166
I'd walk the hell outta here right now.

1:02:56.708 --> 1:02:58.458
I'll shoot you, you son of a bitch.

1:03:02.166 --> 1:03:03.916
I will shoot you.

1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:05.625
Then do it already.

1:03:08.625 --> 1:03:10.500
If I don't get this money,

1:03:10.916 --> 1:03:12.416
I am dead anyway.

1:03:12.791 --> 1:03:14.708
All right? If you pull that trigger,

1:03:14.958 --> 1:03:19.000
then you are gonna have to kill
that loudmouth down the hall

1:03:19.083 --> 1:03:21.416
and every other witness in the place.

1:03:21.708 --> 1:03:25.208
Then you will be as fucked as I am.

1:03:27.375 --> 1:03:28.333
So...

1:03:30.250 --> 1:03:31.458
what's it gonna be?

1:03:44.916 --> 1:03:48.291
Three-way split. And you got your third.

1:03:50.083 --> 1:03:50.958
Don't push it.

1:04:14.541 --> 1:04:15.958
[beeps]

1:04:16.541 --> 1:04:18.083
[ringing]

1:04:18.291 --> 1:04:20.416
-[Casey] <i>Yep?</i>
-Don't react, just listen.

1:04:21.375 --> 1:04:23.375
<i>I got the money.</i>

1:04:23.833 --> 1:04:25.833
<i>You gotta keep him talking</i>
<i>for the next five minutes.</i>

1:04:25.916 --> 1:04:27.375
Since I got the Brita,

1:04:27.666 --> 1:04:30.500
I find the tea tastes noticeably better.

1:04:31.166 --> 1:04:32.458
Not a problem.

1:05:17.166 --> 1:05:19.166
You got balls, I'll give you that.

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:22.291
Can I get my gun back?

1:05:23.041 --> 1:05:25.458
Fuck you. Go buy one.

1:05:53.625 --> 1:05:56.000
I was wondering
when you were gonna remember me.

1:06:03.333 --> 1:06:04.333
[keys jangling]

1:06:07.166 --> 1:06:08.958
[engine starts]

1:06:32.083 --> 1:06:33.791
[brakes squeal]

1:07:31.750 --> 1:07:33.041
[tires screech]

1:07:53.708 --> 1:07:56.208
[panting]

1:08:03.458 --> 1:08:06.250
[woman]<i> It's colorful, I'll say that much.</i>

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:08.250
[man] Yes, it is.

1:08:08.416 --> 1:08:11.208
Uh, I don't expect
you'd ever lose it in your closet.

1:08:11.833 --> 1:08:14.750
Mm. And no dirt bag to replace?

1:08:14.833 --> 1:08:15.916
[man] That's correct.

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.916
A lot of our customers find that handy
and practical.

1:08:19.583 --> 1:08:22.208
But they want an arm and a leg
to pay for it.

1:08:22.291 --> 1:08:24.333
And I ain't paying for no paint job.

1:08:24.458 --> 1:08:26.666
Yes, I agree. It's very expensive.

1:08:26.750 --> 1:08:28.250
But it's a fine product.

1:08:28.750 --> 1:08:31.291
However, if you are in love
with your Kirby,

1:08:31.375 --> 1:08:33.666
I'll bet I could get it
working for you again.

1:08:34.416 --> 1:08:36.291
Uh, be with you in a minute.

1:08:37.125 --> 1:08:39.833
Fixing my Kirby,
how much would that cost?

1:08:40.333 --> 1:08:44.000
Well, I won't know
until I take a good look at it, and it...

1:08:44.541 --> 1:08:47.625
and if it needed a new motor,
it'd be a little bit expensive,

1:08:47.750 --> 1:08:50.916
but certainly not as expensive
as a new Dyson.

1:08:51.333 --> 1:08:53.750
The estimate's free, and...

1:08:53.916 --> 1:08:55.625
all you gotta do is bring it in here.

1:08:55.875 --> 1:08:57.791
-I may take you up on that.
-Excellent.

1:08:57.875 --> 1:09:01.041
If I can get my niece to help me.
They make 'em so heavy.

1:09:01.125 --> 1:09:02.166
Yes, they do,

1:09:02.250 --> 1:09:04.958
and I want you to promise
you won't try to bring it in by yourself.

1:09:05.041 --> 1:09:06.833
-Get that help.
-[woman] Hm.

1:09:07.916 --> 1:09:11.291
I just don't know why they can't
make things to last anymore.

1:09:11.416 --> 1:09:13.416
Oh! You're singing my song.

1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:14.666
[woman chuckles]

1:09:15.166 --> 1:09:16.708
[man] I want you to have a great day now.

1:09:16.791 --> 1:09:19.250
Thank you, thanks for your help.
I'll be back with my Kirby.

1:09:19.333 --> 1:09:21.333
[man] Excellent. Drive carefully.

1:09:23.833 --> 1:09:26.583
If there's any questions I can answer,
just let me know.

1:09:45.083 --> 1:09:47.041
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that.

1:09:48.041 --> 1:09:49.375
I'm open for business.

1:09:54.416 --> 1:09:56.000
Um, I'm looking for a...

1:09:56.958 --> 1:09:58.041
Hoover Max.

1:09:59.083 --> 1:10:00.833
Pressure Max, Max Pressure.

1:10:00.916 --> 1:10:02.541
Hoover, or maybe it's a Pro Max.

1:10:02.625 --> 1:10:04.333
Got like a-- like a filter.

1:10:05.875 --> 1:10:08.541
Hoover products are right over there
on the wall behind you.

1:10:08.625 --> 1:10:10.958
Look, I don't remember
the exact, like, password.

1:10:11.416 --> 1:10:13.083
All right? But it was a vacuum thing.

1:10:16.583 --> 1:10:17.666
Okay, fine.

1:10:18.666 --> 1:10:19.625
Here you go.

1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:25.416
Four...

1:10:26.041 --> 1:10:26.916
six...

1:10:28.916 --> 1:10:29.750
ten...

1:10:33.125 --> 1:10:34.291
fourteen,

1:10:34.791 --> 1:10:36.791
sixteen, eighteen,

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.250
twenty, twenty-two...

1:10:41.250 --> 1:10:43.041
twenty-four, twenty-five.

1:10:43.375 --> 1:10:44.416
There you go.

1:10:44.750 --> 1:10:46.000
$125,000.

1:10:47.791 --> 1:10:49.500
Come on, man, you know why I'm here.

1:10:50.791 --> 1:10:52.708
I can't say I do, no.

1:10:52.791 --> 1:10:55.000
Yeah, you do. You're the guy.

1:10:56.708 --> 1:10:58.125
Yeah, you do.

1:10:58.458 --> 1:10:59.791
You're the guy.

1:11:02.041 --> 1:11:04.583
Look, I am 96 percent sure
that you are the guy,

1:11:04.666 --> 1:11:06.500
so why don't you just, like, admit it?

1:11:08.500 --> 1:11:09.458
[slams hand]

1:11:09.583 --> 1:11:11.708
Look, all right, no wire.

1:11:12.041 --> 1:11:13.833
Okay? No wire.

1:11:14.125 --> 1:11:15.208
And no gun.

1:11:15.291 --> 1:11:17.208
Okay? And nobody knows I'm here.

1:11:17.666 --> 1:11:18.583
I just need...

1:11:19.291 --> 1:11:20.833
just need your services.

1:11:21.625 --> 1:11:24.541
The day at the pickup spot,
you pulled up in a minivan,

1:11:24.625 --> 1:11:26.458
a red Toyota minivan.

1:11:26.541 --> 1:11:27.958
Looks like a kidney bean.

1:11:28.041 --> 1:11:30.833
Same exact minivan
you got parked out back.

1:11:30.916 --> 1:11:32.458
All right? I saw it.

1:11:34.333 --> 1:11:36.000
[sighs] All right.

1:11:36.833 --> 1:11:38.833
You got rules. All right.

1:11:40.041 --> 1:11:43.250
I get that, and I apologize, seriously.

1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:46.000
I didn't go with you that day,
and I am sorry.

1:11:47.458 --> 1:11:50.583
Look, you will never know how sorry,

1:11:50.875 --> 1:11:53.083
but I am here now.

1:11:53.833 --> 1:11:55.333
All right? And I have cash.

1:11:56.333 --> 1:11:57.583
So, please?

1:11:58.083 --> 1:11:58.916
Okay?

1:11:59.291 --> 1:12:00.333
Please?

1:12:08.708 --> 1:12:11.791
-You owe me for that first pickup.
-Yes! [exclaims]

1:12:11.875 --> 1:12:13.000
You're the gu--

1:12:13.375 --> 1:12:15.583
-Wait, what?
-This...

1:12:17.833 --> 1:12:19.750
is previously-owed.

1:12:21.875 --> 1:12:23.125
Going forward,

1:12:24.583 --> 1:12:25.791
were we to,

1:12:27.166 --> 1:12:30.541
would require an additional 125.

1:12:36.166 --> 1:12:37.041
All right.

1:12:37.333 --> 1:12:38.375
Fair is fair.

1:12:39.958 --> 1:12:41.041
A deal's a deal.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.583
All right. Look...

1:12:44.041 --> 1:12:45.083
Four...

1:12:48.875 --> 1:12:49.916
eight...

1:12:51.166 --> 1:12:52.000
ten,

1:12:52.666 --> 1:12:54.416
fourteen, eighteen...

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:56.708
twenty...

1:12:59.000 --> 1:12:59.958
twenty--

1:13:06.458 --> 1:13:07.416
Twenty-two.

1:13:10.708 --> 1:13:11.625
Twenty-two.

1:13:12.833 --> 1:13:13.750
Yeah.

1:13:15.041 --> 1:13:16.166
[muttering]

1:13:16.541 --> 1:13:17.625
Twenty-three.

1:13:17.916 --> 1:13:21.375
By my arithmetic, you're $10,000 shy.

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.250
[sighs]

1:13:29.625 --> 1:13:31.541
[rustling in pockets]

1:13:31.666 --> 1:13:32.958
[mutters]

1:13:33.125 --> 1:13:35.375
[panting]

1:13:51.291 --> 1:13:52.333
Eighty-two hundred.

1:13:54.833 --> 1:13:56.000
Eighty-two hundred.

1:14:00.791 --> 1:14:02.000
May I borrow this?

1:14:09.250 --> 1:14:10.791
[Jesse] What are you doing?

1:14:11.291 --> 1:14:14.000
[man] I'm gathering your belongings.

1:14:14.083 --> 1:14:15.791
[Jesse] No, no no. No, no. Stop.

1:14:15.875 --> 1:14:18.166
I'm not gonna try to collect
what you owe me.

1:14:19.083 --> 1:14:21.208
I don't think it would end well
for either one of us.

1:14:21.666 --> 1:14:23.958
This is not an inconsequential
amount of money.

1:14:24.041 --> 1:14:25.041
Hey, listen to me.

1:14:25.125 --> 1:14:27.791
Spend it wisely,
it will last you for years.

1:14:27.875 --> 1:14:29.625
Please, you don't understand.

1:14:29.708 --> 1:14:32.583
Keep a low profile, travel by night.

1:14:32.666 --> 1:14:33.875
[under breath] Oh, God.

1:14:34.625 --> 1:14:36.000
With a little luck,

1:14:36.625 --> 1:14:40.166
you will soon find yourself
many miles from here.

1:14:41.833 --> 1:14:43.250
Godspeed to you.

1:14:46.291 --> 1:14:47.125
So that's it?

1:14:47.208 --> 1:14:48.208
That's it.

1:14:49.333 --> 1:14:50.458
Now, please leave.

1:14:51.333 --> 1:14:53.750
You are going to jack me up

1:14:54.291 --> 1:14:56.875
over a measly $1,800?

1:14:59.125 --> 1:15:00.500
I've got to reopen.

1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:03.208
The longer you stick around here,

1:15:03.291 --> 1:15:05.208
the more you jeopardize yourself.

1:15:05.291 --> 1:15:06.708
[Jesse] No, hey...

1:15:08.291 --> 1:15:09.500
[lock clicks, door dings]

1:15:09.583 --> 1:15:10.791
No. Hey...

1:15:12.583 --> 1:15:14.208
Have you been watching the news?

1:15:14.291 --> 1:15:16.000
I have. Very much so.

1:15:16.125 --> 1:15:18.166
So you hear
what they've been saying about me.

1:15:19.875 --> 1:15:21.333
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:15:21.416 --> 1:15:23.625
Look, these people,

1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:27.500
they have kept me in a concrete hole.

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:30.291
Look, I don't even know what month it is.

1:15:31.083 --> 1:15:35.000
They made me watch when they...
when they shot someone--

1:15:35.083 --> 1:15:38.041
If you believe that you can
pull on people's heartstrings,

1:15:38.125 --> 1:15:40.333
you should take your chances
with the police.

1:15:41.250 --> 1:15:43.541
From where I sit, you made your own luck.

1:15:44.333 --> 1:15:46.083
As did your former partner.

1:15:46.583 --> 1:15:47.916
As did your lawyer.

1:15:49.375 --> 1:15:51.833
You said it yourself, a deal's a deal.

1:15:53.791 --> 1:15:54.666
No.

1:15:56.875 --> 1:15:58.041
[clicks lock]

1:15:58.166 --> 1:16:00.625
I am not going anywhere.

1:16:02.083 --> 1:16:04.083
I am staying right here

1:16:04.666 --> 1:16:06.333
until you help me.

1:16:07.916 --> 1:16:10.875
[panting]

1:16:15.750 --> 1:16:17.083
[buttons beeping]

1:16:17.250 --> 1:16:18.500
[Jesse] What are you doing?

1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:23.541
Hi, yes.

1:16:23.916 --> 1:16:26.375
There's a young man in my store,

1:16:26.708 --> 1:16:28.000
and he refuses to leave.

1:16:28.083 --> 1:16:29.541
[whispering] Hey, stop.

1:16:29.625 --> 1:16:30.583
I...

1:16:31.375 --> 1:16:33.750
-Yeah, he might be armed.
-Stop it.

1:16:34.541 --> 1:16:35.916
Uh, not overtly.

1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.541
But, yes,
I'm beginning to feel threatened.

1:16:38.625 --> 1:16:40.625
-[Jesse] Are you serious?
-Sure.

1:16:40.708 --> 1:16:42.541
My name is Ed Galbraith.

1:16:42.625 --> 1:16:45.250
I own Best Quality Vacuum,

1:16:45.333 --> 1:16:48.458
2714, 4th Street.

1:16:49.208 --> 1:16:50.625
Northwest. That's correct.

1:16:51.375 --> 1:16:55.125
I would appreciate it very much
if you'd send someone immediately.

1:16:58.083 --> 1:16:58.916
[beeps]

1:17:02.250 --> 1:17:03.416
[Ed sighs]

1:17:12.583 --> 1:17:15.625
You are so full of crap.

1:17:16.583 --> 1:17:18.041
You didn't call anybody just now.

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:19.500
You faked it.

1:17:19.791 --> 1:17:21.375
And you wanna know how I know?

1:17:22.125 --> 1:17:24.458
You got as much to lose as I do.

1:17:25.250 --> 1:17:27.083
More. Way more.

1:17:27.166 --> 1:17:30.708
When your "cops" get here
and they bust me,

1:17:31.250 --> 1:17:34.416
first question they're gonna ask
is what am I doing here,

1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:36.875
trying to hand over
a Hefty bag full of cash

1:17:36.958 --> 1:17:40.166
to a dude who runs
a vacuum cleaner store.

1:17:40.583 --> 1:17:42.791
What comes out then? Huh?

1:17:43.625 --> 1:17:44.625
[chuckles]

1:17:44.708 --> 1:17:47.208
Oh, and you, uh, wanna know
what else is bullshit?

1:17:47.291 --> 1:17:49.291
You know, like, word to the wise:

1:17:49.375 --> 1:17:52.416
next time to try to pull this shit
on someone,

1:17:53.125 --> 1:17:56.416
you don't just hang up on a 9-1-1 call.

1:17:57.208 --> 1:17:58.333
They won't let you.

1:17:58.416 --> 1:18:03.208
Because the lady, or dude, or whoever
is like, "Stay on the line with me, sir.

1:18:03.291 --> 1:18:06.500
Stay on the line
until the officers arrive."

1:18:06.958 --> 1:18:10.500
And if you did hang up,
they'd call you back immediately.

1:18:10.666 --> 1:18:12.791
But, hey, guess what?

1:18:12.875 --> 1:18:15.791
Seriously, yo. Pathetic.

1:18:18.125 --> 1:18:20.791
Wow, you gotta love that response time.

1:18:23.875 --> 1:18:24.791
[Ed] Take your money.

1:18:33.458 --> 1:18:35.583
[door opens and closes at distance]

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:41.916
Officers, thank you very much
for getting here so fast.

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.375
-He obviously heard my call and--
-Is he still here?

1:18:44.458 --> 1:18:46.833
No, he's not, he's gone. I, uh...

1:18:47.125 --> 1:18:49.916
Uh, he was spooked by my phone call

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.333
and he headed up northbound, uh...

1:18:53.458 --> 1:18:55.458
on foot maybe 30 seconds ago.

1:18:55.541 --> 1:18:57.583
-Can you describe him?
-Uh, sure I can.

1:18:57.666 --> 1:18:58.625
He was, uh...

1:18:59.333 --> 1:19:01.291
young, uh, he's white,

1:19:01.375 --> 1:19:03.250
skinny, very tall guy.

1:19:03.333 --> 1:19:04.916
Six-five, six-six.<i> </i>

1:19:05.083 --> 1:19:07.333
Had a tattoo over his right eyebrow.

1:19:07.416 --> 1:19:12.000
-Interesting. A large insect.
-[siren chirps]

1:19:23.458 --> 1:19:25.666

1:19:34.500 --> 1:19:35.583
[phone beeps]

1:19:35.666 --> 1:19:37.958
Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?

1:19:38.833 --> 1:19:41.833
[Jesse]
<i>A deal's a deal? Your word is your bond?</i>

1:19:45.208 --> 1:19:46.208
It is.

1:19:47.708 --> 1:19:49.250
I'll get you your money.

1:20:16.375 --> 1:20:18.375
[phone ringing]

1:20:23.333 --> 1:20:24.291

[Jesse]<i> Hey, Mom.</i>

1:20:27.875 --> 1:20:28.791
Jesse?

1:20:29.375 --> 1:20:30.541
It's Jesse.

1:20:32.166 --> 1:20:33.625
Give me-- Give me the phone.

1:20:34.708 --> 1:20:36.166
Jesse, is that you?

1:20:36.916 --> 1:20:38.625
[Jesse] <i>Hey, Dad. Yeah, it's me.</i>

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.333
<i>How the both of you doing?</i>

1:20:42.125 --> 1:20:43.166
We've been better.

1:20:43.833 --> 1:20:44.708
Yeah.

1:20:45.833 --> 1:20:48.291
How's Jake? Can I say hi to him?

1:20:48.875 --> 1:20:50.875
[Adam]<i> Jake's on a band trip to London,</i>
<i>thank God--</i>

1:20:50.958 --> 1:20:52.750
[both] <i>Jesse, where are you?</i>

1:20:53.666 --> 1:20:56.458
I heard you saying
that I should turn myself in.

1:20:56.541 --> 1:20:59.250
[Diane] Yes. It's the right thing to do.

1:20:59.625 --> 1:21:01.666
[voice breaking]
Quit running and get some help.

1:21:01.750 --> 1:21:03.541
[Adam] No one is trying to hurt you, son.<i> </i>

1:21:03.625 --> 1:21:07.750
Better you come forward on your own,
it'll be safer for you, better all around.

1:21:07.833 --> 1:21:10.708
[Jesse] <i>You remember where</i>
<i>we used to have those picnics?</i>

1:21:10.833 --> 1:21:12.041
All those years ago?

1:21:12.125 --> 1:21:14.708
By the little lake,
the one with all the ducks?

1:21:15.083 --> 1:21:15.916
[Adam] <i>Yeah?</i>

1:21:18.916 --> 1:21:22.166
Do you think you guys
could come get me maybe?

1:21:22.541 --> 1:21:23.791
[Diane sighs]

1:21:26.416 --> 1:21:28.041
-We're on our way.

<i>it's probably too late to say this...</i>

1:21:32.125 --> 1:21:34.625
I don't know if it'll mean much to you...

1:21:39.041 --> 1:21:40.541
but you did your best.

1:21:42.166 --> 1:21:43.791

[Neil] Yeah. Yeah.

1:27:12.958 --> 1:27:15.916
And then after that,
it's the first turn off Broadway.

1:27:18.541 --> 1:27:20.541
No, then you're gonna go ahead
and look for...

1:27:21.416 --> 1:27:23.125
Nah, man, don't go by junkyards.

1:27:23.208 --> 1:27:24.791
There's like 50 junkyards.

1:27:25.208 --> 1:27:26.541

1:27:27.708 --> 1:27:28.583
Yeah, the re--

Yeah, exactly.

That's the one.

1:27:34.583 --> 1:27:35.500
Turn there.

1:27:36.625 --> 1:27:38.750
Yeah. Straight down on the right.

1:27:38.833 --> 1:27:39.916

-The perks are extra.

1:28:32.541 --> 1:28:33.791
[Neil] Well, by all means.

1:28:34.125 --> 1:28:36.208
-I get the first perk.
-We want the perks.

My name is Casey.

1:29:08.500 --> 1:29:10.333

All right.

1:29:36.625 --> 1:29:37.541
Done.

1:29:37.833 --> 1:29:39.208
Bullshit you're done.

1:29:39.291 --> 1:29:40.750
You've been here 20 minutes,
what'd you do?

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:42.833
[Neil] Added a fishplate up here,

1:29:43.416 --> 1:29:45.166
one in the middle, one down at the end.

1:29:45.250 --> 1:29:46.333
[Kenny] Added a what?

1:29:46.416 --> 1:29:47.416
[Neil] A fishplate.

1:29:47.500 --> 1:29:49.750
[Kenny] What, like a... plate of fish?

1:29:50.333 --> 1:29:52.041
What the fuck is that?
Is that even a real word?

1:29:52.125 --> 1:29:53.916
Look, man, I want more of those things,

1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:57.041
the sideway diagonal things,
like twice as many.

1:29:57.541 --> 1:29:58.583
Those are gussets.

1:29:59.833 --> 1:30:01.333
You got enough of 'em already.

1:30:02.041 --> 1:30:05.708
Okay, yeah. So, gussets I got out the ass,
but a fishplate I need 'cause... What?

1:30:05.791 --> 1:30:07.416
I'm Catholic and it's Friday?

1:30:08.375 --> 1:30:12.708
You sure you couldn't just
put a few more gussets up there, Neil?

1:30:13.083 --> 1:30:14.708
I mean, what could it hurt, right?

1:30:14.791 --> 1:30:16.166
Hey, it's your money.

1:30:16.250 --> 1:30:18.041
But what I just did,
you don't even need that.

1:30:18.333 --> 1:30:20.458
-I told you I built this thing right.
-[Kenny chuckles]

1:30:20.541 --> 1:30:24.333
Look, bro, I'm not like impugning
on your precious welding skills.

1:30:25.208 --> 1:30:28.708
It's just we have a, uh,
unique situation here.

1:30:28.791 --> 1:30:29.875
[clears throat]

1:30:32.416 --> 1:30:34.416
[chains rattle]

1:30:38.541 --> 1:30:40.375
Tried to rabbit on us once already.

1:30:41.791 --> 1:30:44.458
I'm thinking he's gonna figure out a way
to break this thing.

1:30:45.041 --> 1:30:45.958
You kidding me?

1:30:46.541 --> 1:30:47.416
Him?

1:30:47.666 --> 1:30:50.958
Yeah, it's just I kinda feel it flexing
a little bit. A bit right here, look.

1:30:51.416 --> 1:30:54.041
-[clanging]
-[grunting]

1:30:54.291 --> 1:30:56.541
Yeah, see? Right there.
Yeah, a little bit.

1:30:56.750 --> 1:30:59.291
[Neil]
Yeah, I don't see jack shit flexing.

1:30:59.666 --> 1:31:01.541
That's four-inch channel iron up there.

1:31:01.625 --> 1:31:03.125
You could hang an F150 from it

1:31:03.208 --> 1:31:05.791
and shove it back and forth
like a beach ball.

1:31:05.875 --> 1:31:06.875
It's going nowhere.

1:31:06.958 --> 1:31:10.916

1:46:05.541 --> 1:46:07.541
Get those electrolytes
you were talking about.

1:46:07.625 --> 1:46:09.833
-Your sodium, you know, all that shit.
-Good, yeah.

1:46:11.750 --> 1:46:12.750
Yeah.

1:46:12.916 --> 1:46:14.916
[coughing]

1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:19.833
[Jesse] Hey.

1:46:20.750 --> 1:46:23.041
-He's all right.
-[Walter] I'm fine, thank you.

1:46:23.541 --> 1:46:24.958
-You all right?
-I'm fine. Good.

1:46:25.041 --> 1:46:26.166
-Sit down.
-All right.

1:46:42.541 --> 1:46:44.625
How long will it take to sell this batch?

1:46:47.833 --> 1:46:49.250
-Six months.
-[Walter] Jeez...

1:46:49.333 --> 1:46:50.458
Easy. Maybe more.

1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.541
There's no one that you can think of
who might...

1:46:53.958 --> 1:46:55.125
buy the entire amount?

1:46:55.208 --> 1:46:58.666
Uh, someone with a spare $1.3 million
lying around? No.

1:46:59.208 --> 1:47:00.500
Can't say that I do.

1:47:06.041 --> 1:47:10.291
Your family is gonna get every dime
they got coming to them, Mr. White.

1:47:11.291 --> 1:47:12.916
No matter how long it takes.

1:47:19.583 --> 1:47:21.916
-Hydrate. Seriously.
-Yeah.

1:47:30.875 --> 1:47:32.916
[Walter] What about you, Jesse? Hm?

1:47:33.708 --> 1:47:36.208
-[Jesse] Huh?
-After this. What then?

1:47:37.333 --> 1:47:38.458
[Jesse grunts]

1:47:39.291 --> 1:47:41.333
Nothing? What about college?

1:47:41.750 --> 1:47:42.833
[laughs]

1:47:42.958 --> 1:47:46.458
No, what is stopping you
from going to college?

1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:47.958
Um...

1:47:49.250 --> 1:47:51.500
-Nothing, I guess.
-Yeah, nothing at all.

1:47:52.250 --> 1:47:54.958
-Say you went to college.
-[Jesse] Uh-huh...

1:47:55.250 --> 1:47:57.666
What would you study, you think, eh?

1:47:58.208 --> 1:47:59.166
What interests you?

1:48:02.250 --> 1:48:03.416
Sports Medicine?

1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:06.166
Sports Medicine.

1:48:06.583 --> 1:48:07.416
Yeah.

1:48:08.666 --> 1:48:11.000
That's-- Yeah, sure. That's...

1:48:11.583 --> 1:48:12.875
-[Jesse] Yeah.
-...could...

1:48:13.625 --> 1:48:16.416
Or... Business. Hm?

1:48:16.625 --> 1:48:18.083
Business and Marketing.

1:48:19.083 --> 1:48:21.666
You could practically teach that class.

1:48:21.916 --> 1:48:24.375
-Well, yeah.
-I mean, you'd be a natural.

1:48:25.708 --> 1:48:29.375
And with a Business degree,
I mean, that's handy anywhere.

1:48:30.791 --> 1:48:31.750
[Jesse] Yeah.

1:48:32.125 --> 1:48:34.625
-Yeah, I guess that could be cool.
-[Walter] Yeah.

1:48:34.708 --> 1:48:36.000
You could do it too.

1:48:37.500 --> 1:48:38.541
First step,

1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:41.750
get your GED, that's no problem.

1:48:42.708 --> 1:48:44.291
What do I need a GED for?

1:48:44.625 --> 1:48:45.750
I got my diploma.

1:48:47.791 --> 1:48:48.875
Oh.

1:48:49.583 --> 1:48:51.875
Of course, yeah, right.
Right, right, right.

1:48:51.958 --> 1:48:54.750
Yo, you were standing right on stage
when they handed it to me.

1:48:54.833 --> 1:48:56.500
I know, it just slipped my mind.

1:48:56.583 --> 1:48:59.500
I totally graduated high school, dick.

1:48:59.583 --> 1:49:02.208
-Which is no thanks to you, all right?
-Just stay on the subject here.

1:49:02.291 --> 1:49:03.166
All right?

1:49:03.375 --> 1:49:05.583
The larger point being...

1:49:08.583 --> 1:49:11.625
You know, look, forget it.
I-- I don't have a larger point.

1:49:11.708 --> 1:49:14.125
-I'm just making conversation.
-[Jesse] Yeah.

1:49:18.333 --> 1:49:19.333
Hm.

1:49:22.458 --> 1:49:24.375
You're really lucky, you know that?

1:49:29.083 --> 1:49:32.291
You didn't have to wait your whole life
to do something special.

1:51:30.708 --> 1:51:32.083
This is Alaska.

1:51:34.750 --> 1:51:38.041
Forty miles in that direction
gets you to Haines.

1:51:41.458 --> 1:51:42.625
It's quiet.

1:51:44.166 --> 1:51:45.083
[Ed] Yeah.

1:51:45.500 --> 1:51:47.333
Figured you could use some of that.

1:51:54.166 --> 1:51:55.166
All right.

1:51:55.833 --> 1:51:56.833
Date of birth?

[Jesse] 06/10/84.

1:52:00.125 --> 1:52:01.833
-Mother's maiden name.
-Stackhouse.

1:52:02.375 --> 1:52:03.500
Where was she born?

1:52:03.916 --> 1:52:06.500
Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Japan.

1:52:06.833 --> 1:52:08.000
Father's date of birth.

1:52:08.375 --> 1:52:10.000
02/07/51.

1:52:10.375 --> 1:52:12.916
Your father's second to the last job.

1:52:14.375 --> 1:52:17.958
Claims adjuster, Dairyland Insurance,
Appleton, Wisconsin.

1:52:18.041 --> 1:52:19.833
What's your social security number?

1:52:19.916 --> 1:52:22.958
[Jesse] 141-18-6941.

1:52:23.208 --> 1:52:24.083

1496-81-141.

1:52:33.250 --> 1:52:34.166
[Ed] All right.

1:52:35.083 --> 1:52:37.500
Daylight's burning,
you know where you're going.

1:52:37.625 --> 1:52:38.708
Anything else?

1:52:44.583 --> 1:52:45.875
Hold on a sec.

1:53:18.458 --> 1:53:19.791
[sighs]

1:53:34.583 --> 1:53:35.875
Seal this up, please.

1:53:41.541 --> 1:53:43.666
I'm going to Mexico City in about a month.

1:53:43.750 --> 1:53:45.750
I'll mail it from there.

1:53:46.833 --> 1:53:49.125
Anyone else you wanna say goodbye to?

1:53:51.708 --> 1:53:54.458
Not many of us
get a chance to start fresh.

1:53:55.916 --> 1:53:57.916
Good luck, Mr. Driscoll.

[Jesse] <i>I was thinking about that thing</i>

1:54:56.875 --> 1:54:58.875
Going where the universe takes you?

1:54:59.833 --> 1:55:00.875
Right on.

1:55:01.875 --> 1:55:03.666
I think it's a cool philosophy.

1:55:05.291 --> 1:55:08.000
I was being metaphorical.
It's a terrible philosophy.

1:55:12.916 --> 1:55:15.541
I've gone where the universe takes me
my whole life.

1:55:18.208 --> 1:55:20.625
It's better to make those decisions
for yourself.
