00:01.914 --> 00:02.915
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:02.453 --> 01:03.628
[drums beating]

01:23.648 --> 01:24.997
-[laughter]
-[indistinct chattering]

01:28.392 --> 01:30.002
[bird squawking]

01:35.617 --> 01:36.966
[indistinct chatter]

01:37.009 --> 01:39.011
[laughing]

02:09.955 --> 02:12.175
[Ketill] Othere.

02:12.219 --> 02:15.352
You have returned.
Welcome, welcome.

02:19.182 --> 02:20.488
Welcome.

02:21.532 --> 02:22.707
Othere.

02:22.751 --> 02:23.752
[laughs]

02:23.795 --> 02:26.537
Please, sit. Drink.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.105
Othere.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.847
Meet Ubbe,

02:31.890 --> 02:34.763
the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.373
He has come a long way
to meet you.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.898
You are Othere.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.599
This is my wife, Torvi.

02:48.864 --> 02:53.521
Ubbe is especially interested
in your journeys
to the far west of here.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.872
[scoffs]

02:56.915 --> 02:58.439
It was such a long time ago.

02:58.482 --> 03:02.269
Oh, please, please,
I would like to hear about it.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.401
I would like to know about
this new land that you found.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.925
[all murmuring]

03:14.890 --> 03:17.501
Very well, then.

03:17.545 --> 03:22.289
I was sailing west from here,
along the land,

03:22.332 --> 03:26.118
when a storm
blew my ship off course.

03:26.162 --> 03:29.600
When the storm had ended,
there was no more land.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.950
And I did not know
where I was.

03:33.387 --> 03:36.216
Days followed days.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.914
I started running out
of food and water.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.004
I began to give myself up
for dead.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.011
But then...

03:49.054 --> 03:53.581
Then one morning,
the sun rose behind me.

03:53.624 --> 03:58.150
And I saw it,
I saw a new land.

04:00.022 --> 04:04.026
The winds blew me
all day down the coastline.

04:04.069 --> 04:06.985
The lands were lofty,

04:07.029 --> 04:14.036
with many high mountains,
all so beautiful

04:14.079 --> 04:16.517
and of a thousand shapes,

04:16.560 --> 04:18.910
and filled with trees so tall,

04:18.954 --> 04:22.566
it seemed that
they would touch
the sky itself.

04:25.003 --> 04:31.183
And I saw
marvelous pine groves
and vast, fertile plains.

04:31.227 --> 04:35.100
I tell you,
Ubbe, son of Ragnar,

04:36.885 --> 04:40.671
this was indeed golden land.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.500
[all murmuring]

04:52.248 --> 04:54.337
Why did you not stop there?

04:54.381 --> 04:58.907
The winter tides
were too strong
and I was swept away.

04:58.950 --> 05:03.999
And in the morning, I found
myself back in the open ocean
again.

05:04.042 --> 05:08.308
I was fortunate enough
to find a small island
with game and water,

05:08.351 --> 05:12.877
and, at last, the currents
brought me back here.

05:12.921 --> 05:16.316
But I have never forgot
what I did see.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.501
You, you will sail with us.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.329
You will try and find
this land again.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.118
[chuckles softly]

05:36.161 --> 05:37.859
Perhaps, if you think
I can be of some help.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.906
To the golden lands!

05:41.950 --> 05:44.866
[all] Golden lands!

05:51.046 --> 05:52.743
And what of Floki, hmm?

05:53.962 --> 05:57.008
Floki? I never met Floki.

05:59.402 --> 06:03.754
Floki had disappeared
before Othere arrived
and sailed west.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.933
It has been a long day.
I am tired.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.548
[Ubbe] Thank you all
for the feast.

06:14.591 --> 06:19.161
We're very happy to be here
in Iceland, at the edge
of the world.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.902
-Sleep well.
-Good night.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.565
He does not
need to know everything.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.501
[panting]

06:57.112 --> 06:58.418
[whimpers]

07:11.343 --> 07:12.562
[drums beating]

07:23.051 --> 07:24.052
[crowd chattering]

07:36.064 --> 07:37.282
Queen Gunnhild.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.502
Erik.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.896
Just Erik.

07:44.072 --> 07:47.031
I am so impressed by you.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.730
Impressed? Why?

07:49.773 --> 07:52.994
That you are not jealous,
that you allow this to happen.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.569
[Gunnhild] Erik.

08:02.612 --> 08:07.443
You saved my husband's life,
but you did not save mine.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.533
You don't know me
well enough to pretend
to know my feelings.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.100
They belong to me.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.886
[Erik] I'm sorry,
Queen Gunnhild.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.149
Forgive me.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.082
[Gunnhild] You are young.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.911
I wonder if you really know
the stories of the gods.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.306
Of course I do.

08:44.349 --> 08:47.396
Then you know the story
of Freyr.

08:47.439 --> 08:51.269
[Ingrid] Yes,
she is the goddess
of fertility.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.315
She lives in the hall
called Sessrumnir

08:53.358 --> 08:55.230
and travels in a chariot
drawn by cats.

08:55.273 --> 08:58.233
Yes, yes, yes.
Every child knows that.

08:59.713 --> 09:03.238
The fact is, her necklace,
the Brisingamen,

09:03.281 --> 09:06.546
was paid for by sex
with the dwarves who made it.

09:06.589 --> 09:10.288
Loki accused her of having sex
with every single one
of the elves

09:10.332 --> 09:11.942
in the Aesir.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.554
And she shares half of those
slain in battle with Odin.

09:14.597 --> 09:18.209
But when her own husband
is away, she weeps.

09:18.253 --> 09:22.823
But not watery tears, Ingrid.
Tears of gold.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.651
Real treasure.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.142
If you want to go to her,
you should go.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.667
This is your wedding night.
She will be expecting you.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.279
I am with child,

09:44.322 --> 09:46.281
and I am married to a demigod.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.240
As are you.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.155
Don't talk to me about
ridiculous things,

09:51.199 --> 09:53.723
about human jealousies,

09:53.767 --> 09:57.292
the trivial and repeated
concerns of humankind.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.903
I thought you were above them.

09:59.947 --> 10:03.994
I thought
you were a free spirit.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.001
Now, you are free.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.745
Go and marry my husband,
with my blessing.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.931
I didn't want to hurt you.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.979
I wasn't sure.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.285
No, I'm afraid that has been
your failing.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.027
But now, be sure.

10:37.071 --> 10:40.335
You made a decision.
Live with it.

10:40.378 --> 10:43.817
Believe in it. Otherwise,
how can I ever respect you?

10:55.263 --> 10:56.046
[kisses]

10:59.833 --> 11:01.312
[sighs]

11:22.203 --> 11:23.421
[sighs softly]

11:30.994 --> 11:32.213
[breathing deeply]

11:48.272 --> 11:50.492
[Bjorn] I know King Harald
will come for me.

11:50.535 --> 11:54.496
If he wants to be king
of all Norway,
then he must eliminate me,

11:54.539 --> 11:58.282
in which case we need
to redouble our patrol
in the fjord.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.328
And you must lead them.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.680
Me?

12:07.944 --> 12:12.819
I trust you because you
need to keep me alive

12:14.385 --> 12:15.952
so you can stay alive.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.437
[gasps]

12:22.480 --> 12:23.264
[cries]

12:33.535 --> 12:35.276
Surely this is taking
a long time.

12:37.495 --> 12:38.845
What is it?

12:39.367 --> 12:40.760
[panting]

12:46.156 --> 12:47.636
What is the problem?

12:47.679 --> 12:50.160
The baby is lying
in the wrong position.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.075
Torvi cannot deliver it
naturally.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.513
[screaming, crying]

13:05.088 --> 13:07.699
I have come to pray
for the woman and child.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.317
[Torvi groaning]

13:24.629 --> 13:26.240
[indistinct praying]

13:36.598 --> 13:38.861
What is that for?

13:38.905 --> 13:41.559
I may have to cut her stomach
to take out the baby.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.264
Does that mean she will die?

13:54.442 --> 13:56.052
[sobbing loudly]

14:18.901 --> 14:19.946
[exclaims]

14:36.310 --> 14:37.702
[cries]

14:39.661 --> 14:40.967
Not yet.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.318
Sweet darling.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.329
[screams]

15:05.730 --> 15:06.906
[continues praying]

15:10.648 --> 15:12.259
Yes, it's coming, now.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.477
All right.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.437
[Amma] Now, you start.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.655
[Torvi gasping]

15:19.919 --> 15:21.485
I can see the head!

15:21.529 --> 15:23.052
[Torvi screaming]

15:23.096 --> 15:24.662
Once more, yes!

15:24.706 --> 15:26.664
Keep going, keep going,
keep going, yes!

15:27.535 --> 15:29.624
Yes, it's here!

15:31.104 --> 15:32.105
[baby crying]

15:42.680 --> 15:43.943
[laughs]

16:10.708 --> 16:11.666
[man shouting at distance]

16:19.326 --> 16:21.502
[indistinct shouting]

16:22.720 --> 16:24.984
Who are these people?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.724
I don't know.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.509
But they're not Viking.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.641
And it's not one
of King Harald's ships.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.079
They are scouts.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.906
[man] But where from?

16:49.138 --> 16:49.965
[speaking Russian]

16:51.662 --> 16:52.924
[men shouting]

16:55.840 --> 16:57.016
[men shouting]

17:00.715 --> 17:01.716
[screams]

17:03.413 --> 17:04.545
[grunting]

17:15.643 --> 17:16.687
[yelling]

17:18.167 --> 17:19.168
[both grunting]

17:38.883 --> 17:39.841
[in native tongue]

17:45.673 --> 17:46.804
[indistinct shouting]

18:16.921 --> 18:18.749
You look like shit.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.797
I feel like it.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.239
What are you wearing?

18:34.069 --> 18:34.939
[chuckles]

18:49.084 --> 18:50.781
[man shouting indistinctly]

18:56.744 --> 18:58.659
Why do you keep returning?

18:59.790 --> 19:00.661
Hmm?

19:00.704 --> 19:02.706
Why do you hunt me so?

19:04.752 --> 19:05.970
I don't understand.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.803
But I am happy to see you.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.896
Truly happy to see you.

19:52.843 --> 19:53.844
[sighs]

19:54.758 --> 19:56.151
Who are these people?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.980
[man] Rus, the same people
we met in Kiev.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.721
The same people that Ivar
is staying with.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.855
[Bjorn sighs]

20:04.899 --> 20:06.683
What does it mean?

20:06.727 --> 20:08.990
Why did they come
and raid here?

20:09.033 --> 20:11.384
[Bjorn] They were not raiding.
They were scouting.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.517
By probing our defenses.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.432
They plan
to invade our country.

20:18.129 --> 20:21.002
I've heard stories of Rus.

20:21.045 --> 20:24.788
They are a vast kingdom,
rich in resources.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.095
Huge armies.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.402
Perhaps they mean to invade
all of Scandinavia.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.142
Hmm.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.841
With Ivar's help
and knowledge.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.017
How pleased he must be

20:36.060 --> 20:38.846
to think he is returning
in triumph.

20:38.889 --> 20:43.111
We cannot possibly resist
invasion from such
a powerful enemy.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.026
And yet we must resist!

20:47.420 --> 20:49.770
They won't move
their armies in the winter.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.687
We have until spring
to decide what to do.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.782
In your heart,
you know what you have to do.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.568
Harald is king of all Norway.

21:05.612 --> 21:10.834
You have to reach out to him,
offering peace
and a united front.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.836
You say that
because of your history.

21:14.403 --> 21:17.188
What do you mean?

21:17.232 --> 21:20.627
I've been told King Harald
asked for your hand.

21:20.670 --> 21:25.327
[Erik] With respect,
what other fight can there be?

21:25.371 --> 21:28.417
Kattegat cannot
stand against Rus.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.463
You're right.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.901
And Gunnhild is correct.
We must make common cause
with King Harald.

21:33.944 --> 21:37.165
I charge you to leave urgently
to King Harald's kingdom.

21:37.208 --> 21:40.473
Perhaps he will see sense
and do away
with his own vanity.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.475
[exhales]

21:42.518 --> 21:43.911
What do the Rus believe in?

21:44.912 --> 21:46.479
They're Christians.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.959
[scoffs]

21:49.003 --> 21:50.787
They believe
in the Christian god.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.920
Then, we are not only
fighting for ourselves,

21:52.963 --> 21:54.530
but for our gods!

21:56.010 --> 21:58.926
And with Odin's help,
we must succeed.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.065
However impossible the task.

22:13.027 --> 22:16.247
[Ubbe] I want us all to drink
to the birth of our son.

22:16.291 --> 22:20.034
We have decided to name him
Ragnar, after his grandfather.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.863
[laughs]

22:22.906 --> 22:25.822
Hail, Ragnar!
Long live Ragnar.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.955
-Skol.
-[all] Skol!

22:30.523 --> 22:32.351
I want to thank all of you
for your help.

22:34.048 --> 22:37.312
And I want to thank you,
Othere.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.446
For your prayers
for my wife and for my son.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.756
But since I lived in England,
I could not help
but recall them.

22:50.194 --> 22:53.676
They were Christian prayers
to a Christian god.

22:58.028 --> 22:58.899
[chuckles]

23:02.555 --> 23:06.341
I solicited only our gods.
After all, why should
I do otherwise?

23:08.082 --> 23:10.998
I don't know. You tell me.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.136
[inhales softly]

23:23.010 --> 23:24.925
I am...

23:24.968 --> 23:28.232
Or rather, I was,
a long time ago,
a monk living in England.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.759
My name then was Athelstan.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.502
[laughs]

23:36.545 --> 23:37.416
Athelstan?

23:38.634 --> 23:40.375
Hmm.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.420
[Ubbe laughs]

23:44.727 --> 23:47.513
I was sent to a seminary
in Rome.

23:50.341 --> 23:55.564
They chose to send me out
into the world
as a missionary,

23:55.608 --> 23:59.046
to take the word of God
to those who had
never heard it.

24:01.744 --> 24:05.835
I still remember my sea voyage
to Scandinavia.

24:05.879 --> 24:10.187
The local people discovering
my purpose nearly killed me,

24:11.537 --> 24:14.017
and chased me away.

24:14.061 --> 24:21.068
And, so, onwards,
to other places,

24:21.111 --> 24:23.244
having failed
at being a missionary.

24:24.637 --> 24:27.204
I had learned some Norse

24:29.380 --> 24:36.300
and I had met
a Danish wanderer
by the name of Othere.

24:37.432 --> 24:41.175
He spoke to me of his travels,

24:41.218 --> 24:45.222
of the wondrous sights he had
seen and the miracles
he had witnessed

24:45.266 --> 24:46.310
along the way.

24:50.097 --> 24:53.535
But he was sick and dying.

24:56.407 --> 24:57.408
[grunting]

25:05.721 --> 25:07.070
I buried him.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.248
And I took his name.

25:11.292 --> 25:12.511
[fire crackling]

25:18.604 --> 25:22.695
Then, I came here,

25:22.738 --> 25:25.698
to this young settlement.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.528
Reborn.

25:34.141 --> 25:37.971
It was then
I determined
to set sail again,

25:40.364 --> 25:43.977
and it was
on this subsequent voyage

25:45.282 --> 25:49.548
that I glimpsed
the golden land.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.464
[Othere sighs]

25:53.508 --> 26:00.254
But as you know,
I returned, defeated,

26:00.297 --> 26:06.390
resigned to live
this false identity
for the rest of my days.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.137
You lied to everyone here.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.880
And you have been
living a lie ever since.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.188
You are a Christian.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.931
You are an enemy of our gods.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.195
So you deserve to die.

26:32.503 --> 26:33.809
It's not true.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.598
I always knew that Othere
was not what he claimed,

26:39.641 --> 26:42.601
but in our desperate situation,
I accepted everyone

26:42.644 --> 26:46.169
-who offered us no harm--
-Then you were wrong.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.958
Othere may have offered
no physical threat,

26:52.001 --> 26:54.177
but his ideas, his beliefs,

26:54.221 --> 26:56.005
his lies!

26:59.052 --> 27:00.531
They are the real threat.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.752
To all of us.

27:04.710 --> 27:05.972
To our children.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.364
Do you not understand?

27:13.066 --> 27:15.068
You must be sacrificed
to our gods.

27:17.853 --> 27:24.425
And then, beloved, we would
never find the golden land.

27:24.468 --> 27:28.168
Without Othere, we have
no chance. We might
as well give up now.

27:35.305 --> 27:37.699
Here's the cross
you used to wear.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.267
How could you have forgotten?

27:40.310 --> 27:43.618
You were baptized
as a Christian.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.620
You prayed aloud
to the Christian god.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.049
Who are you?

28:23.092 --> 28:25.181
My name is Erik.

28:25.225 --> 28:29.229
I come as emissary
from King Bjorn.
Here is his ring to prove it.

28:29.272 --> 28:31.448
[Harald] Very well.

28:31.492 --> 28:36.802
And why has
King Bjorn sent you?

28:36.845 --> 28:38.455
He wants to make an alliance.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.153
[scoffs]

28:41.632 --> 28:43.460
An alliance?

28:43.504 --> 28:46.420
I don't need an alliance
with Bjorn.

28:46.463 --> 28:50.598
He's already my vassal,
and I am his king and overlord.

28:50.641 --> 28:52.339
Perhaps he has forgotten.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.384
I don't think you understand.

28:54.428 --> 28:57.344
-You don't know the enemy we--
-[Harald] On the contrary!

28:59.868 --> 29:03.567
I know everything.

29:05.744 --> 29:10.096
I know you, forest Skogarmaor.

29:10.139 --> 29:11.314
An outlaw.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.493
You came to my kingdom before.

29:16.537 --> 29:19.888
You had a secret trade
in slaves.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.761
And you have a history
of violence.

29:24.153 --> 29:27.330
And murder.

29:27.374 --> 29:32.553
You got into a fight here
and you killed
several of my men.

29:36.905 --> 29:39.952
[clicks tongue]

29:39.995 --> 29:45.522
Now, everyone knows that
a Skogarmaor, if he comes in
from the forest,

29:45.566 --> 29:48.351
can be killed with impunity.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.358
[laughs]

29:59.885 --> 30:01.495
Ah.

30:01.538 --> 30:05.368
Therefore, you will be
executed in the morning.

30:06.369 --> 30:07.370
At my pleasure.

30:07.936 --> 30:08.807
[grunts]

30:12.114 --> 30:13.550
[Harald] Take him away.

30:13.594 --> 30:14.813
Chain him up.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.904
Pour cold water over him
all night,

30:18.947 --> 30:21.776
so he won't have a moment
to forget his fate.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.563
No! No, you need to listen.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.348
Listen to me!
We're all in danger.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.573
[bell tolling]

30:40.229 --> 30:43.363
Our brother has poisoned
your mind,

30:43.406 --> 30:47.367
convincing you that
I was your enemy.
I am not your enemy.

30:56.463 --> 30:59.466
Get well, get strong.

31:01.511 --> 31:04.471
We shall unleash our forces
against our brothers.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.475
They will bear witness
to our triumph.

31:09.258 --> 31:10.738
Hmm?

31:10.781 --> 31:11.695
[chuckles]

31:19.486 --> 31:20.487
[grunts]

31:25.405 --> 31:26.710
I killed her, Ivar.

31:29.670 --> 31:32.238
It was me, not you.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.631
Me.

31:35.806 --> 31:37.896
I killed her,
and now she's dead.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.637
Who?

31:40.681 --> 31:42.422
[Hvitserk] You know who.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.293
Lagertha.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.513
The bitch.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.865
You thought
it was your fate.

31:50.909 --> 31:51.692
Hmm.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.435
It was mine, Ivar.

31:56.653 --> 31:57.524
Mine.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.488
I killed her.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.537
I killed her.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.147
[laughs]

32:19.938 --> 32:21.243
[chuckles]

32:34.735 --> 32:36.998
[Ubbe] What do you want?

32:37.042 --> 32:39.044
[Othere] I have brought
you something.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.058
It's a wedding ring. So what?

32:53.101 --> 32:56.191
[Othere]
It's not just a wedding ring.
It's Floki's wedding ring.

33:00.152 --> 33:02.241
Why do you have
Floki's wedding ring?

33:06.201 --> 33:09.596
I did meet Floki.
I knew Floki.

33:09.639 --> 33:11.511
Did Floki know that
you are a Christian?

33:12.599 --> 33:15.558
Yes, I'm sure.

33:15.602 --> 33:18.735
So, what happened here?
Why did Floki just disappear?

33:19.345 --> 33:20.737
Hmm?

33:20.781 --> 33:22.348
I know something terrible
must have happened...

33:22.391 --> 33:24.567
Was it Ketill? What did he do?

33:26.830 --> 33:30.834
Floki left because he had
no hope left for humanity.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.145
He gave you his ring?

33:38.581 --> 33:40.975
It was his most precious
possession.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.847
But he no longer wanted it.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.633
He left this place naked.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.684
I loved Floki.

33:54.728 --> 33:57.818
I've told you the truth.

33:57.861 --> 34:00.603
I beg you to take me with you
on the voyage to find
the golden land.

34:00.647 --> 34:02.736
It means everything to me.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.129
Is your name really Athelstan?

34:10.831 --> 34:13.616
You have no idea
what that name means to me.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.145
What do you want,
you old fool?

34:21.755 --> 34:24.018
I almost forgot you existed.

34:27.065 --> 34:31.852
You once told me
the only reason
you kept me alive

34:31.895 --> 34:37.075
is because one day
I might say something wise

34:37.118 --> 34:38.772
for an old fool.

34:38.815 --> 34:39.860
Hmm.

34:41.035 --> 34:43.646
So, I'm telling you now.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.867
Listen to that man.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.176
Who cares
if he is a Skogarmaor?

34:51.219 --> 34:55.441
We are all Skogarmaors.
We all came from the forest.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.184
Execute him if you like,

34:59.227 --> 35:04.102
but, first, listen,
listen to what he has to say.

35:05.929 --> 35:08.628
He risked his life
to return here.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.893
Are you too proud to ask why?

35:23.469 --> 35:26.776
[Erik] Same symbols,
same people.

35:27.864 --> 35:30.650
These are the Rus.

35:30.693 --> 35:33.043
And you have to understand
how powerful they are

35:33.087 --> 35:34.828
and what a threat they pose.

35:37.874 --> 35:40.442
Even so,

35:40.486 --> 35:46.666
it irks and irritates me
that I have to listen
to a criminal like you.

35:49.451 --> 35:50.887
[ax clatters]

35:50.931 --> 35:54.500
Or a failed king like Bjorn.

35:59.983 --> 36:04.031
My greatest ambition,
the purpose of my life,

36:04.074 --> 36:06.425
was to become king
of all Norway.

36:06.468 --> 36:10.429
And now
that I have achieved it,
I don't know why...

36:10.472 --> 36:14.955
Why must I be dragged down,

36:14.998 --> 36:17.914
forced to rely
on unpredictable allies

36:17.958 --> 36:21.744
who have already shown to be
weak and unreliable.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.096
[clicks tongue]

36:26.140 --> 36:27.881
Why does it have
to be like this?

36:28.882 --> 36:29.752
Hmm?

36:31.363 --> 36:34.801
In my dreams,
it was never like this.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.850
Words cannot wish this away.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.202
[thuds]

36:47.770 --> 36:49.816
The Rus are coming.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.648
[sighs heavily]

37:03.830 --> 37:08.008
Very well, I agree.

37:08.051 --> 37:12.142
But only if Bjorn's forces,
his warriors,

37:12.186 --> 37:14.101
and his shield-maidens
come to me,

37:14.144 --> 37:17.539
to protect the capital
and not Kattegat,
and then I agree.

37:19.976 --> 37:24.154
We can be allies. Huh?
Why not? Why not?

37:24.198 --> 37:27.332
I am sure
that Bjorn will agree.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.769
-After all, they're most
likely to--
-We have agreed.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.256
Send word to Bjorn

37:40.867 --> 37:42.869
to move his forces here.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.263
And I must send word
to all my vassal kings.

37:47.047 --> 37:51.356
It seems like we need
all their help, after all.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.538
[Ivar] Prince Oleg.

37:59.581 --> 38:01.148
Princess Katia.

38:01.191 --> 38:03.237
Your Highnesses.

38:03.281 --> 38:07.241
Allow me to present to you
my brother, Hvitserk.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.244
Just lately
risen from the dead.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.898
Your Highness.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.640
[Oleg] Another son
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

38:14.683 --> 38:15.902
You are welcome.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.079
You arrive
in interesting times.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.082
So I understand.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.824
My brother has told me
that you intend to attack
our homeland.

38:27.130 --> 38:27.914
Hmm.

38:29.829 --> 38:32.092
It was once my homeland.

38:32.135 --> 38:35.574
I'm only reclaiming the past.

38:35.617 --> 38:39.360
I trust you will be happy
to join King Ivar and myself

38:39.404 --> 38:42.450
in this great undertaking.

38:43.756 --> 38:44.931
[chuckles]

38:46.280 --> 38:47.803
I have nowhere else to go.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.718
[all laugh]

38:49.762 --> 38:52.591
I'm at your service,
Prince Oleg.

38:52.634 --> 38:56.246
I, too, need to reclaim
my own past.

38:56.290 --> 39:00.033
The prince and I
are so happy to have you
at our court, Hvitserk.

39:01.774 --> 39:05.038
Ivar has spoken
a lot about you.

39:05.081 --> 39:10.739
When you were children,
when you jumped ship.

39:10.783 --> 39:15.222
He told me that you always
believed you were fated
to be together,

39:15.265 --> 39:21.446
however many times
fate itself seemed to have
pulled you apart.

39:21.489 --> 39:26.189
I find myself
that fate works
in mysterious ways.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.375
Our army's assembling.

39:39.768 --> 39:43.293
Tonight, you will watch
some of it

39:44.382 --> 39:46.166
parade past the palace.

39:53.565 --> 39:56.002
It should be
an interesting experience.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.192
[Ivar] So?

40:12.801 --> 40:13.802
So?

40:15.935 --> 40:18.372
What do you think?

40:18.416 --> 40:22.898
-About Oleg?
-No, not about Oleg,
about his wife.

40:22.942 --> 40:25.379
I thought she was attractive,
rather provocative.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.120
Nothing else?

40:27.163 --> 40:29.557
No. What else?

40:29.601 --> 40:31.777
She didn't remind you
of anyone?

40:33.039 --> 40:35.302
You saw her.
You know who she is.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.609
-I do?
-Of course you do, brother.

40:39.828 --> 40:40.960
She's Freydis.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.006
Your wife?

40:46.748 --> 40:49.229
Freydis is dead, Ivar.
I saw her body--

40:49.272 --> 40:52.014
Yes, yes, yes.
I know I killed her.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.321
But now she's come back,
and I do not know how.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.976
But it is her.
She is identical.

40:59.239 --> 41:00.458
You're still crazy, Ivar.

41:14.820 --> 41:15.995
[man] Ivar.

41:17.649 --> 41:20.869
Prince Dir
sends you greetings.

41:20.913 --> 41:23.437
He knows your brother
has joined you.

41:23.481 --> 41:27.615
He wishes you all success
in your campaign.

41:27.659 --> 41:33.055
But afterwards, he wants you
to join him in the overthrow
of Prince Oleg.

41:33.099 --> 41:36.755
And the rescue
of Prince Igor from slavery.

41:36.798 --> 41:39.497
If you still
agree to this plan,
simply nod your head.

41:41.281 --> 41:42.630
Good.

41:42.674 --> 41:44.284
You know how much
Prince Dir loves you.

41:54.903 --> 41:56.035
[drums beating]

41:58.646 --> 41:59.734
[horses neighing]

42:02.389 --> 42:04.347
[indistinct shouting]

42:43.212 --> 42:44.692
[man shouting in Russian]

42:51.177 --> 42:53.222
[shouting continues]

43:00.534 --> 43:02.667
[man shouting in Russian]

43:42.837 --> 43:44.622
[horses neighing]

43:54.457 --> 43:56.242
Who can resist such an army?

43:57.025 --> 43:58.200
Nobody.

43:59.767 --> 44:04.293
Not King Harald,
not Bjorn Ironside.

44:05.381 --> 44:07.209
They are like children.

44:08.820 --> 44:11.039
They and their gods
will be destroyed.

44:12.867 --> 44:17.785
This, my good friends,
is the end of paganism.

44:19.395 --> 44:21.441
The end of the pagan gods.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.241
[music playing]
