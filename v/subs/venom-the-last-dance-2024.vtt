I am no god of the
void, slicer of worlds.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.085
Long ago, when light invaded my kingdom,

01:26.920 --> 01:32.967
my symbiote children
betrayed me and imprisoned me here.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.308
At last a codex is being created.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.228
It is the key to my freedom.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.606
It will unlock this prison.

01:47.607 --> 01:54.656
I order you to search the corners
of the universe until you find this key.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.201
Find me the codex.

02:05.333 --> 02:09.963
And when I escape and
annihilate every living planet and

02:10.338 --> 02:17.971
destroy my symbiote
offspring, I will reward you with your lives.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.844
So you're saying in this
universe there's the superhero people.

02:58.845 --> 03:05.268
Hi, so tell me again about your
purple alien friend who really loves stones.

03:06.394 --> 03:11.858
I'll tell you what, man,
aliens, they do not love stones.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.526
They don't start.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.320
Do not love stones.

Do you know what they love?

03:19.032 --> 03:22.869
They love eating brains
because that's what they do.

03:23.328 --> 03:27.999
Señor, he made my
family disappear for five years.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.169
Five years.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.757
See, that is a long time.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.009

that I like our version of the barman better.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.910
My head hurts.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.330
I feel like I'm drunk, but
I'm also hungover at the same time.

04:11.167 --> 04:17.382

04:18.883 --> 04:20.009
Why, gross milk.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.314

04:34.315 --> 04:37.026
I'd rather have a glass of water.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.277

former reporter Eddie Brock for questioning after

05:12.687 --> 05:15.648

Detective Patrick Mulligan.

05:16.065 --> 05:16.274
No.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.652

was found in Pail and that's a

05:19.652 --> 05:22.947

happenings at the city's cathedral.

Only time will tell.

We can't go back to San
Francisco and I'm not staying down

my life in Mexico, that's for sure.

kicked out of New York.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.230
What a dick.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.357
I still got a ton of shit on him too.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.652

see the Statue of Liberty.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.822
Maybe we could blackmail him.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.699
Clear my name.

Well, I assume by the
threatening look on your faces that I, uh...

08:55.952 --> 08:57.912
We should take the wrong path, Batman.

We can let you leave.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.708

09:04.043 --> 09:06.963
On account of the
fact that I was drinking a lot.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.381
I'm going to be honest.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.927
I have a really dark
and unpredictable side to me.

tear your head off and feed it to your asshole.

I'm here. You can feed it to me.

Yeah, I can feed it to him.

speaking. This is for you.

a symbiote is in its full true form.

31:00.066 --> 31:00.275
Right.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.318
You mean you can't come out.

I can do this.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.029
I can do this.

31:05.488 --> 31:10.159
But if I fully transform, the
codex sends her a tracking signal.

31:10.410 --> 31:15.206
She'll find us, rip it out of
our spine, and free Nal from Klyntar.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.708
So how do we get rid of this codex?

31:16.958 --> 31:20.878
As long as you and I
both live, the codex exists.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.799
If one of us should
die, the codex will die.

31:24.799 --> 31:25.967
That's not gonna work for me.

31:25.967 --> 31:26.342
Or me.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.303
That enophage was fast.

31:28.344 --> 31:31.556
It will take long
for the feds to tie us to

bodies we left in Mexico.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.518
We gotta get outta here.

31:35.518 --> 31:36.561
Yeah, we better go.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.943
Four legs are better than one.

get that thing to go without killing it?

31:51.618 --> 31:52.952
Only one way to find out.

many alien invasion movies, Rex.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.798
They were always migrating.

33:30.133 --> 33:34.637
A meteor carrying symbiote life,
crashes on Earth, and they all survive.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.014
Coincidence? Give me a break.

33:39.225 --> 33:39.559
Alright.

33:41.811 --> 33:42.603
Let's go get them.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.400
You're so desperate to believe
that they're here for altruistic reasons.

33:49.777 --> 33:50.319
Makes you dangerous.

33:56.325 --> 33:59.662
[tense music]

33:59.662 --> 34:03.750
We just intercepted an
emergency call from an airbus out

34:03.750 --> 34:06.419
of Mexico, saying a man
jumped off the plane over Sequoia.

34:07.712 --> 34:08.629
We'll take the osmore.

34:09.881 --> 34:10.840

34:24.645 --> 34:24.854

34:26.355 --> 34:27.315
That was horrible.

There's something
else out here. Something else?

38:10.913 --> 38:13.708
He said this would
happen. I just lost three people.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.334
Can you collect any samples?

Those were some special forces shit.

They were trying to
kill us. Yeah. Yeah, great.

38:47.533 --> 38:48.993
Great. So now we have the cops.

38:49.702 --> 38:55.499
The United States Army and
some creature from hell hunting us.

38:55.499 --> 39:00.713
Oh, God, I just saw blood in a
spray out of the back of an alien's face.

39:10.347 --> 39:11.724
They killed someone.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.893
They didn't give you a choice.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.314
You didn't give me a
choice. I couldn't get to you.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.984
It's a year ago when you stole my life.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.944
We've been together for a whole year.

39:23.944 --> 39:27.490
A year too long. Just stay hidden
while we get to New York without getting killed.

talked about, the creature...

39:48.594 --> 39:48.928
It's here.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.307
It killed some people.

is so beautiful.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.144
I sense...

40:45.317 --> 40:49.905
I sense my old one.

40:55.327 --> 41:02.042
And yet, the one Nolceaks is not here.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.463

41:06.463 --> 41:07.298
What does he seek?

41:10.342 --> 41:11.302
The Black One.

41:11.343 --> 41:13.179
The Black One?

41:14.221 --> 41:14.805
Voxymbia?

41:15.472 --> 41:17.558
He's the only one who carries a Codex.

41:20.728 --> 41:21.520
The end...

41:23.063 --> 41:23.856
is now.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.195
[hissing]

41:32.406 --> 41:33.115
You need your suit.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.285
Still worried about
giving this thing a cold?

41:37.578 --> 41:40.331
Venom carries the key to Nolce's freedom.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.083
Never obtain it.

41:43.542 --> 41:44.668
Or your race will be killed.

41:46.670 --> 41:46.879
You...

41:49.340 --> 41:49.882
and you...

41:51.342 --> 41:52.051
and...

41:53.636 --> 41:53.844
you...

41:57.097 --> 41:59.350
everyone, everything.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.144
How do we stop whatever's
up there from coming down here?

42:02.394 --> 42:03.771
You can't.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.732
He's older than the universe.

42:08.317 --> 42:09.318
He means the key.

42:10.319 --> 42:14.990
Then everything will end.

42:18.327 --> 42:20.454
How do we stop him from getting it?

42:21.121 --> 42:24.792
If the symbiote and the host are alive,

42:26.168 --> 42:28.712
then the Codex is alive.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.341
And if one of them dies?

42:33.342 --> 42:34.301
The Codex dies?

42:35.386 --> 42:36.303
The Codex dies.

42:36.345 --> 42:37.429
The Codex dies.

42:39.348 --> 42:40.391
Rex, you can't be serious.

42:40.391 --> 42:40.849
Oh, I'm game.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.561
Destroying the Codex is the
only way it remains unobtainable.

42:45.020 --> 42:45.271
Right?

42:46.897 --> 42:48.274
Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you.

42:48.440 --> 42:48.941
Destroying it?

42:49.483 --> 42:51.610
We have barely
even scratched the surface.

42:51.610 --> 42:52.444
My people are dead.

42:54.530 --> 42:57.116
Something is
coming that cannot be beaten.

42:58.617 --> 43:00.202
I'm stopping all this shit right now.

43:00.494 --> 43:01.203
Science is sacrifice.

43:01.412 --> 43:01.620
Teddy.

43:04.790 --> 43:06.333
Is serious. Listen to her.

43:34.320 --> 43:40.200
[door opens]

43:40.200 --> 43:53.922
Have you spoken to your family recently?

43:56.592 --> 43:57.885
Is everything okay?

44:02.556 --> 44:03.057
Yeah.

44:05.142 --> 44:09.313
I smell wet dog and sauce emerges.

44:09.730 --> 44:12.441
Hey, friendo. You okay there?

44:15.069 --> 44:19.073
No, I'm not okay.
It's pretty wild out there.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.992
I know. You hungry?

44:23.327 --> 44:23.369
Yes.

44:24.370 --> 44:24.870
Come over.

44:26.538 --> 44:26.914
Thank you.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.291
Well, this is my wife, Nova Moon.

44:29.625 --> 44:30.125
Hi.

44:30.709 --> 44:33.670
And these are my kids, Echo and Leaf.

44:33.879 --> 44:34.963
A lifetime in therapy.

44:35.339 --> 44:35.839
Don't.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.842
Don't you dare.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.678
Wow, how beautiful are your children?

44:43.097 --> 44:44.223
And that's Blue.

44:44.681 --> 44:47.434
Who is a dog?

44:48.143 --> 44:49.144
And I'm Martin.

44:49.770 --> 44:50.187
Hey, Martin.

44:50.604 --> 44:50.771
Hey.

44:52.022 --> 44:52.564
I'm Eddie.

44:52.606 --> 44:53.524
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

44:53.524 --> 44:54.274
You too. Pleasure.

44:54.650 --> 44:55.317
Come sit, please.

44:55.317 --> 44:56.402
Okay.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.444
Come on, thank you.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.114
Jesus Christ.

45:01.865 --> 45:03.158
So, right.

45:04.243 --> 45:07.996
Oh, so nothing died
on that plate namaste, man?

45:08.080 --> 45:08.705
Thank you.

45:09.289 --> 45:09.998
Help, Tash!

45:11.834 --> 45:12.251
Oh, dear.

45:13.752 --> 45:14.378
Eddie, where are you headed?

45:15.045 --> 45:15.754
New York.

45:16.130 --> 45:16.630
Oh, wow.

45:17.089 --> 45:17.714
Yeah, all right.

45:18.298 --> 45:20.801
Long way to New
York. We're naked shrimps, man.

45:21.927 --> 45:22.219
Yeah.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.804
We could ride you out to Vegas.

45:25.347 --> 45:25.556
Yeah.

45:25.848 --> 45:27.891
These people are weird. I'm telling you.

45:28.267 --> 45:29.893
That would be so kind. Thank you.

45:29.893 --> 45:30.310
You're welcome.

45:30.769 --> 45:32.312
Of course. Life's one big adventure.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.480
Who doesn't love making new friends?

45:33.772 --> 45:34.106
Right?

45:35.023 --> 45:37.901
This guy is so one of
those serial killer hitchhikers

45:37.901 --> 45:39.445
from my favorite murder podcast.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.156
Baby, not now.

45:42.489 --> 45:44.658
That was social
services not taking us away yet.

45:45.742 --> 45:47.911
She's joking.

45:48.412 --> 45:48.871
I'm not.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.289
Please, honey.

45:52.207 --> 45:54.293
So we're riding the
extraterrestrial highway.

45:54.334 --> 45:54.877
Yep.

45:54.877 --> 45:55.627
Watch me. Who is it?

45:55.919 --> 45:57.880
It's the road that leads to Area 51.

45:58.464 --> 46:02.509
See if we can spot as an alien before
they shut the place down forever, you know?

46:02.801 --> 46:04.678
It's my lifelong dream.

46:04.928 --> 46:06.430
We can show him right now.

46:06.430 --> 46:06.972
Not a believer?

46:09.933 --> 46:13.562
Actually, Martin, how do I put this?

46:16.523 --> 46:16.982
I am.

46:17.316 --> 46:17.566
Oh.

46:17.566 --> 46:20.903
That's the I am I big, big believer.

46:21.236 --> 46:22.196
You're not that big.

46:22.404 --> 46:23.071
Oh, and you can be enough.

46:23.780 --> 46:25.449
And actually, I was in I.T.

46:25.449 --> 46:25.866
Were you?

46:26.325 --> 46:26.492
Yeah.

46:26.492 --> 46:27.784
That's so cool.

46:27.784 --> 46:28.243
Thanks.

46:28.911 --> 46:32.289
I hope you don't
get disappointed, you know?

46:32.581 --> 46:40.005
And I hope that if you do find
one, I hope you meet a really good alien.

46:40.923 --> 46:46.678
Not a bad one.

46:47.554 --> 46:48.055
Yeah.

46:48.055 --> 46:48.305
Yeah.

46:50.599 --> 46:53.352
I know a dark
force when I see one, Eddie.

47:03.237 --> 47:05.280
It's kind of hot in here.

47:05.572 --> 47:06.615
You get used to it.

47:07.199 --> 47:08.951
A.C. is really bad
for your health, you know.

47:10.994 --> 47:11.328
All right.

47:12.037 --> 47:12.538
Family ready?

47:13.163 --> 47:13.413
Yep.

47:14.498 --> 47:14.957
Guest ready.

47:15.999 --> 47:17.334
Let's rock this camper.

47:19.586 --> 47:21.964
Ground control to Major Tom.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.050
Oh, I love a sing-along.

47:25.509 --> 47:28.220
Ground control to Major Tom.

47:29.513 --> 47:30.389
Shoot me in the face.

47:30.847 --> 47:34.601
Take your protein
pills and put your helmet on.

47:34.601 --> 47:35.102
Oh, yeah.

47:35.769 --> 47:36.937
This is my jam.

47:37.521 --> 47:37.729
Nine.

47:38.313 --> 47:38.939
Eight.

47:39.898 --> 47:40.482
Seven.

47:41.358 --> 47:41.817
Six.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.028
Commencing compound engines on.

47:46.029 --> 47:46.238
Three.

47:46.780 --> 47:47.322
Two.

47:47.322 --> 47:49.074
Check it out.

47:49.074 --> 47:49.283
One.

47:49.491 --> 47:52.119
And make God's love be in the rafter.

47:53.370 --> 47:55.497
Come on, Eddie, sing along.

47:55.497 --> 47:56.123
I'm good.

47:56.373 --> 47:57.291
Are you in the world?

47:57.666 --> 47:59.501
No. Just think of this as the tour bus.

47:59.501 --> 48:01.211
We're the band, and
you could be the groupie.

48:01.211 --> 48:01.878
Come on.

48:02.212 --> 48:03.088
Don't be square.

48:03.463 --> 48:04.172
Don't get me started.

48:04.590 --> 48:07.718
This is Major Tom's ground control.

48:08.343 --> 48:10.846
I'm stepping through the door.

48:12.347 --> 48:17.144
And I'm floating
in the most peculiar way.

48:17.352 --> 48:22.065
Care up, and the
stars look very different today.

48:23.317 --> 48:23.567
Why?

48:23.984 --> 48:28.572
For he is my city in a tin can.

48:28.864 --> 48:29.948
Can make a tin!

48:30.115 --> 48:33.368
Far above the world.

48:34.077 --> 48:34.953
Like a bath, already.

48:35.829 --> 48:40.334
Planet Earth is blue,
and there's nothing I can do.

48:42.669 --> 48:42.836
No.

48:42.836 --> 48:45.589
This is ground control to Major Tom.

48:45.797 --> 48:50.135
Sometimes I think we would
have been happier with a life like this.

48:50.677 --> 48:54.181
And the players want to know, shall we?

48:55.515 --> 48:56.016
Yeah.

48:56.016 --> 48:59.811
Now the signs lead
to cash for a few days.

49:01.813 --> 49:02.022
My love.

49:02.564 --> 49:05.400
This is Major Tom to ground control.

49:06.401 --> 49:08.111
I'm stepping through the door.

49:10.322 --> 49:14.326
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way.

49:15.369 --> 49:19.790
And the stars look very different today.

49:21.291 --> 49:25.796
For he is my city in a tin can.

49:27.255 --> 49:30.967
Far above the world.

49:57.119 --> 50:01.790
(crunching)

50:03.417 --> 50:04.209
You like chocolate?

50:05.752 --> 50:08.213
Shh, they don't let us eat sugar.

50:10.549 --> 50:11.007
They don't?

50:13.218 --> 50:14.720
I have a friend who loves chocolate.

50:15.429 --> 50:15.971
Thank you.

50:16.763 --> 50:17.931
It's very kind of you.

50:21.768 --> 50:22.894
I don't wanna see an onion.

50:24.438 --> 50:24.771
You don't?

50:26.982 --> 50:27.274
Scary.

50:31.361 --> 50:31.528
Okay.

50:33.405 --> 50:34.865
Well, you know, it's okay to be scared.

50:37.325 --> 50:37.743
I'm scared.

50:38.326 --> 50:40.746
Like, I go all the time.

50:42.497 --> 50:43.582
Promise I won't see anyone?

50:48.462 --> 50:48.837
Buddy.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.634
Aliens are not real, okay?

50:55.844 --> 50:56.052
Promise.

50:58.764 --> 50:58.972
Okay.

51:07.856 --> 51:08.982
You said the right thing.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.193
You would make a good dad.

51:25.957 --> 51:28.251
We've come a long way, you and me.

51:30.003 --> 51:32.005
We have many more roads to travel, Buddy.

51:32.547 --> 51:33.590
Wouldn't that be nice?

51:33.590 --> 51:34.424
You say something?

51:37.844 --> 51:40.931
No, just dream in, I guess.

51:50.065 --> 51:50.982
That's the near Rika.

51:52.609 --> 51:53.109
Near Rika?

51:53.735 --> 51:54.069
Yeah.

51:55.111 --> 51:56.905
There's a doorway in our minds

51:57.072 --> 51:59.449
that usually remains hidden in secret

51:59.658 --> 52:01.326
until the time of death.

52:04.162 --> 52:05.914
Crazy things in this world, Eddie.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.793
You can see them if you're open.

52:12.128 --> 52:12.963
Oh, I seen them.

52:17.259 --> 52:20.136
I'm glad we didn't eat this fine, family.

52:25.141 --> 52:48.790
(upbeat music)

52:48.790 --> 52:50.959
Welcome to the city of Second chances.

52:53.044 --> 52:53.253
Whoa.

52:55.130 --> 52:58.508
(upbeat music)

53:06.683 --> 53:10.145
Thank you.

53:10.186 --> 53:10.520
Thank you.

53:11.187 --> 53:11.563
Here, buddy.

53:12.230 --> 53:12.606
Thank you.

53:12.689 --> 53:13.732
Stay blue, stay.

53:13.982 --> 53:14.274
Thank you.

53:14.733 --> 53:15.191
Okay, blue.

53:15.609 --> 53:15.817
Vegas.

53:21.281 --> 53:22.741
Listen, I just want you to have this.

53:24.242 --> 53:24.534
Please.

53:25.410 --> 53:26.411
Thank you.

53:26.786 --> 53:28.747
Quality support, cushioning.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.917
Plus, they come with
an anti-microbial footbed.

53:31.958 --> 53:33.168
No, reject them.

53:33.418 --> 53:34.085
Wasp the trucks.

53:35.086 --> 53:35.420
Thank you.

53:36.630 --> 53:40.133
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world

53:40.759 --> 53:42.260
But I'll always remember you

53:47.015 --> 53:47.432
Goodbye, Martin.

53:49.184 --> 53:50.310
It's goodbye for now.

53:50.602 --> 53:52.145
That's what I like to think, Eddie.

53:54.064 --> 53:54.648
Okay, bye.

53:56.232 --> 53:56.650
Hey, Martin.

53:59.569 --> 54:01.696
That doorway, the near Rika?

54:02.238 --> 54:03.949
Yeah, it's open.

54:05.200 --> 54:05.450
Do I?

54:05.784 --> 54:08.078
Just be safe.

54:10.997 --> 54:11.206
Okay.

54:12.666 --> 54:13.041
Thanks.

54:21.132 --> 54:21.591
Oh, Jesus.

54:21.883 --> 54:22.092
What?

54:24.302 --> 54:25.553
Well, this is an all-time low.

54:34.604 --> 54:35.188
You have chocolate.

54:37.524 --> 54:38.066
Yum!

54:39.526 --> 54:41.194
Oh, oh, oh.

54:45.115 --> 54:52.163
I would like to see her
where we get to New York, Eddie.

54:53.248 --> 54:55.208
You know, she was
built to welcome visitors

54:55.375 --> 54:56.251
to America, buddy.

54:57.377 --> 54:57.794
That's you.

54:58.753 --> 54:59.796
You think so, Eddie?

55:00.797 --> 55:01.548
Oh yeah, I know so.

55:02.757 --> 55:04.926
When we get out of this
mess, we're gonna go see her.

55:04.926 --> 55:06.052
We're gonna say, "Hi, Lady Liberty."

55:06.761 --> 55:08.138
And see her Broadway show!

55:09.597 --> 55:09.973
Yeah, sure.

55:10.890 --> 55:11.141
Wow!

55:12.058 --> 55:14.477
I know how much you hate musicals.

55:16.479 --> 55:17.230
Yeah, it's gonna look great.

55:33.371 --> 55:34.497
What's next, Thelma?

55:35.165 --> 55:38.376
Well, Louise, I'm not sure $20

55:38.710 --> 55:41.046
is gonna get us much
in the way of motor transport.

55:42.964 --> 55:46.009
But I'm not ever
riding an alien horse again.

55:47.135 --> 55:49.304
So I guess it looks
like we're stealing cars.

55:49.929 --> 55:51.473
No, I've watched Rain Man

55:51.473 --> 55:54.726
and in my infinite
wisdom as a celestial being,

55:55.310 --> 55:56.895
working the system is easy.

55:57.645 --> 56:00.940
You hit the slots,
then blackjack, then roulette,

56:01.566 --> 56:05.028
bingo, bango, luxury
ride, Bluetooth sound system,

56:05.278 --> 56:08.239
racing, and the top down.

56:08.907 --> 56:10.742
Because that's how we roll.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.702
Harris Casino has a strict dress code.

56:15.080 --> 56:15.705
No, you know what?

56:15.914 --> 56:16.623
It's a hotel.

56:17.540 --> 56:18.875
These are my vacation clothes.

56:19.250 --> 56:20.085
You're better ones.

56:20.627 --> 56:21.419
He's not wrong.

56:21.920 --> 56:22.462
Look at you.

56:23.338 --> 56:25.632
No, don't push it, all right, buddy?

56:27.300 --> 56:27.675
Want a hand?

56:27.967 --> 56:28.218
Yes.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.639
That did me, knock him out.

56:32.889 --> 56:33.515
What are you doing?

56:33.765 --> 56:34.849
He was being a dick.

56:35.141 --> 56:35.600
Yeah, I was.

56:35.642 --> 56:36.643
Oh, look.

56:40.772 --> 56:41.815
We need a disguise.

56:44.567 --> 56:45.193
What are we doing?

56:46.069 --> 56:47.445
Hey, hey man.

56:47.987 --> 56:48.321
Hi.

56:51.950 --> 56:52.408
Oh, God.

56:52.784 --> 56:53.368
Whoa.

56:57.914 --> 57:01.918
Why do you keep rocking people out?

57:01.918 --> 57:02.961
What is wrong with you?

57:03.962 --> 57:04.212
What?

57:05.964 --> 57:06.965
So sorry, buddy.

57:08.133 --> 57:09.676
I am so, so sorry.

57:10.426 --> 57:12.428
Hey there, you're my baby.

57:12.887 --> 57:15.473
Now no one will recognize us.

57:16.224 --> 57:16.474
Seriously.

57:17.934 --> 57:21.312
You could get voted
people's sexiest man of the year.

57:22.355 --> 57:24.941
If anyone cared who you are anymore.

57:25.024 --> 57:26.985
I've won sexy man awards before.

57:27.318 --> 57:27.902
Of course you have.

57:29.445 --> 57:30.321
Hey, hey.

57:30.780 --> 57:31.823
The guy that did that,

57:32.282 --> 57:34.701
sorry, he's in the arched over there.

57:34.701 --> 57:35.410
He shitfaced.

57:37.912 --> 57:38.788
You're bad people.

57:39.706 --> 57:40.331
Yeah, we are.

57:41.082 --> 57:42.667
We're keeping his shoes, by the way.

57:44.586 --> 57:47.380
We are so money and we know it.

57:47.839 --> 57:48.631
Welcome to the Paris.

57:49.257 --> 57:49.757
Thank you.

57:50.049 --> 57:50.466
No, thank you.

57:52.886 --> 57:55.054
Baby, here I am

57:55.180 --> 57:56.848
I'm a man on the scene

57:57.932 --> 57:59.809
I can give you what you want

57:59.851 --> 58:01.728
But you got to go home with me

58:02.854 --> 58:05.023
I forgot some good old lovin'

58:05.148 --> 58:06.566
And I got some sun and gold

58:07.692 --> 58:08.568
Oh, yes!

58:08.902 --> 58:11.029
Let me multiply the 20.

58:11.404 --> 58:12.989
Let me quadruple-fire it.

58:12.989 --> 58:13.489
What are you doing?

58:15.491 --> 58:16.951
No, this is all the money that we have.

58:16.993 --> 58:19.370
Look for your lady tonight!

58:23.333 --> 58:24.083
Snazzy jacket!

58:24.459 --> 58:26.002
Let's eat up and steal it.

58:30.340 --> 58:32.759
I know Lady Luck is on our side tonight!

58:33.009 --> 58:34.302
No, I would say that Lady Luck

58:34.302 --> 58:36.471
is definitely not on your side tonight.

58:36.471 --> 58:39.182
But I would even go
so far to say that Lady Luck

58:39.807 --> 58:40.642
hates you, buddy.

58:40.808 --> 58:41.893
I can't stop now!

58:42.310 --> 58:43.186
Of course you can't stop.

58:43.436 --> 58:44.479
What is this feeling?

58:44.479 --> 58:45.355
It's like-- This feeling?

58:45.355 --> 58:45.563
Ha!

58:45.772 --> 58:48.149
It's like all of my
problems have gone away!

58:48.233 --> 58:49.192
Do this all the time.

58:55.031 --> 58:56.783
Errol, I need more money.

59:00.078 --> 59:02.205
But we don't have any more money, buddy.

59:02.538 --> 59:02.789
God!

59:03.539 --> 59:04.040
God bless!

59:05.458 --> 59:06.626
You are a sore loser.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.002
Yes, sir, it is!

59:08.461 --> 59:08.753
Oh!

59:09.837 --> 59:11.923
I think you broke my foot.

59:12.423 --> 59:14.634
God, Lady Luck is a fickle slut!

59:15.176 --> 59:15.551
Oh.

59:15.593 --> 59:17.470
We should have played that machine!

59:17.512 --> 59:18.638
Yes, yes, yes!

59:19.555 --> 59:21.266
No, F-ing, wait!

59:24.185 --> 59:24.811
Eddie, bro!

59:25.561 --> 59:26.312
Mrs. Chen!

59:26.854 --> 59:27.939
Oh, no, no, no!

59:28.398 --> 59:29.899
Mr. Chen, it's Mrs. Chen!

59:30.191 --> 59:31.484
Oh, Mrs. Chen!

59:31.943 --> 59:32.735
Eddie, please!

59:33.861 --> 59:35.363
Mrs. Chen, Mrs. Chen!

59:35.655 --> 59:36.447
I'm gonna cry!

59:36.781 --> 59:37.240
Me too.

59:39.284 --> 59:41.077
Wow, what happened to you?

59:41.411 --> 59:42.161
You look hot!

59:42.578 --> 59:43.246
So do you.

59:43.246 --> 59:43.871
Really hot.

59:43.913 --> 59:45.123
I always look hot.

59:45.164 --> 59:45.415
Yeah.

59:45.790 --> 59:46.874
Is a big guy in there?

59:47.041 --> 59:47.417
Yeah.

59:47.458 --> 59:48.084
Do you like my dress?

59:48.751 --> 59:49.919
I've been wearing so big,

59:49.919 --> 59:51.713
they gave me a credit
line at the clothes store,

59:51.713 --> 59:53.548
and then the penthouse suite.

59:53.589 --> 59:55.591
Wow, you know I stole this suit

59:55.591 --> 59:57.051
of a guy who pissed on me.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.429
I knocked him out, I left him in a bush.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.556
Well, that explained a stink.

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:03.725
You could use my room to clean up,

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:04.225
and then we--

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:05.226
Heartache.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.728
Oh, that would be so good.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.229
And room service.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:09.897
(woman screams)

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:22.744
We got him.

01:00:23.369 --> 01:00:27.206
Positive ID on Brock's
CCTV hit the Paris Hotel, Vegas.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.584
Have we reconstituted the six?

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:30.460
Yes, sir.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:31.961
Put him in.

01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:47.810
The six are on route.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.271
They'll bring him in.

01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:53.316
But this time I'm requesting control

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.525
of the Imperium program.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:00:59.489
You have my permission, General.

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:11.167
When thunder roars,

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:12.960
and it roars,

01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:14.504
and it roars,

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:16.214
and it roars.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:30.353
(ominous music)

01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:33.564
Let's dance, baby.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:36.359
Yeah, I love dances.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:38.778
Please eat that thing will find us.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.904
Don't be a party pooper.

01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:42.365
No, do not encourage him.

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:44.409
You know what, Mr.
Chen, we are fugitives.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.203
We are on the run,
so thank you for having us.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:48.454
We gotta go.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:49.288
You're no fun.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:52.125
One last dance before you go.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.210
We never do anything I want to do.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:56.003
Just a little dance.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:57.797
And you gave up.

01:01:58.297 --> 01:01:59.507
Away my chickens.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.227
Let's cut around, Mrs. Chen.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:12.687
I give up.

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:24.490
Oh no, I cannot unsee that.

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.367
I cannot unsee that.

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:30.246
(upbeat music)

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.039
You can dance.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:34.250
You can dance.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:38.045
Having the time of your life.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.722
When did you two practice this?

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:51.851
(sighs)

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:01.110
(upbeat music)

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:12.830
God damn it!

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.208
I told you this would happen.

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:17.543
(screams)

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.837
Don't panic, she can't see the kudex.

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:21.422
What the hell is that?

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:23.174
Wow, so ugly.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:26.302
Stay where you can.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:31.015
She can't see the
thing she's looking for.

01:03:31.015 --> 01:03:33.893
(screams)

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:42.527
Oh!

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:50.451
You live anyhow!

01:03:53.412 --> 01:03:53.871
I choose.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:05.758
(suspenseful music)

01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:24.026
Wow.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:27.238
(laughs)

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:29.824
Area 51.

01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:30.616
Yeah.

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:31.534
Huh?

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:32.451
Yeah.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:36.872
We made it.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.710
You finally got to see it, Den.

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:43.462
It's kind of cool.

01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:44.088
Huh.

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:45.131
I guess.

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:47.341
Yeah.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:51.554
Leaf.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:54.307
Where you going, hon?

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:58.311
Well, let's see if we
can't find us something cooler.

01:04:58.769 --> 01:04:59.061
Come on.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:00.438
Come on, guys.

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:01.230
Okay, babe.

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:02.565
Life's long dream.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:04.191
All right, go, go, go, go, go!

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.277
I smell alien.

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:11.198
(laughs) (suspenseful music)

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.660
He's deteriorating without his host.

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:16.412
Poor thing.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.165
Put him below with the others.

01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:20.791
I'm safer there.

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:24.879
(suspenseful music)

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.658
(grunts)

01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:57.495
Down, down.

01:05:58.162 --> 01:05:59.038
Come on, come on.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:08.673
All right.

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.467
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:15.054
I think we're gonna get
a better view from up there.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:18.349
Follow me, guys, and come on.

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:20.267
This is so exciting.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:26.899
I can't believe we're here.

01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:36.867
Wow.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.039
Whoa.

01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:43.916
Oh, well.

01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:46.585
What is this?

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.845
(suspenseful music)

01:06:58.639 --> 01:06:59.473
It's all broken.

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:02.435
So sad.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.823
Oh, buddy.

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:18.492
Hey, buddy.

01:07:22.246 --> 01:07:23.247
Oh, no.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:26.542
No.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:33.132
Oh, no, how many
hours can you have in one day?

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:35.926
Eddie?

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:41.932
Hello?

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:46.854
They did this to me.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:49.565
(suspenseful music)

01:07:50.107 --> 01:07:50.274
Morgan?

01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:52.193
What?

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:53.694
You're alive?

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:56.614
What are you doing here?

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:00.868
We're being hunted, Eddie.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.496
You have what he needs.

01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:09.293
Protect the Codex from dark hands.

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:13.255
A symbiote army waits here.

01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:15.174
Free them.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:17.927
Protected, Eddie.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:24.350
Now must stay locked away.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.148
Eddie, I'm Dr. Payne.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:34.568
Where's my friend?

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:35.611
He's safe for now.

01:08:37.696 --> 01:08:38.239
Great news.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:40.491
We're all done here.

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:42.910
All of this is out of your hands.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:44.370
This is my lab.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.663
No, no, no, not yours.

01:08:45.663 --> 01:08:46.455
You just work here.

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:47.373
Or you did.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.583
You, Christmas, you're going home.

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.876
And what about them?

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.336
You heard what it said.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:54.839
The Codex only
exists if they're both alive.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.965
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

01:08:57.258 --> 01:08:58.384
You killed one of my people.

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:00.427
I'm returning the favor personally.

01:09:00.427 --> 01:09:01.679
Please escort Dr. Payne out here.

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:03.347
Christmas, time to go.

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:04.348
Hey!

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:10.855
(growling)

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:15.526
Big mistake.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.029
(grunting)

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.448
(growling)

01:09:22.449 --> 01:09:22.992
Fire!

01:09:23.784 --> 01:09:24.076
Run!

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:24.994
Fire!

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:29.498
Fire!

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:31.250
(growling) (yelling) (gunshots)

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:35.087
(growling)

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.755
(gunshots)

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.383
Venom, run, go!

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:41.552
(yelling)

01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:48.058
(yelling)

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.148
Release the symbiotes.

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:59.445
(yelling)

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:03.991
(yelling)

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:08.287
(gunshots)

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:11.415
(yelling)

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:11.707
(grunting)

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:12.333
(growling)

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.251
(yelling)

01:10:14.251 --> 01:10:20.591
(gunshots) (yelling) (yelling)

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:22.551
Jim!

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:27.598
(growling)

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.267
Turn her down!

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:30.893
Get her!

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:34.188
(growling)

01:10:37.524 --> 01:10:38.525
Let's go, boy.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:39.610
Take her down!

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:41.987
(growling)

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.240
(yelling)

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:46.742
I'm gonna fall down!

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.747
(yelling)

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.459
Help!

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.390
(growling)

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:13.143
Come on!

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:16.230
(growling)

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:19.817
Leave her!

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:20.359
Leave her!

01:11:20.734 --> 01:11:22.194
Get the clonax outta here!

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:26.031
(growling)

01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:30.536
That's our way out.

01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:32.329
(growling)

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:36.709
(gunshots)

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.173
You break us out of here!

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:45.300
(growling)

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.179
There's no aliens here, kids.

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:55.644
Best shoes ever!

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.229
Whoa!

01:11:57.771 --> 01:11:58.564
What was that?

01:11:59.148 --> 01:11:59.481
(gunshots)

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:05.237
We gotta go, move it!

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:11.368
(growling)

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:14.580
We are leaving!

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:15.664
Move!

01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:17.833
Move, move!

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.212
It's all right, it's all right, kids.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:28.552
Aliens!

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.387
Alien invasion!

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:32.473
Alien attack!

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.317
Motherfucker!

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.113
(growling)

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.324
You two, get out, Lord!

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:51.575
Hey, wait, sir, hold me!

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:53.077
You're high on the airborne!

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:54.203
Move, move, move!

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:55.412
In the harbor's gulf!

01:12:55.412 --> 01:12:57.623
We got to get the
codex as far away as possible.

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:58.582
(growling)

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:01.210
It's Eddie?

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:01.960
It's Eddie.

01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:02.336
It's Eddie.

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:03.212
Eddie!

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:04.004
Eddie!

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.090
Oh no, Eddie, Eddie!

01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:11.136
Martin, I'm family!

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:17.393
Can't be here, Martin.

01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:18.894
Dark forces, man!

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.780
(growling)

01:13:37.454 --> 01:13:38.539
Ricky, can you help us?

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:39.873
I lied.

01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:41.667
Aliens are real.

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.128
My best friend in the whole world is one.

01:13:44.336 --> 01:13:45.546
He's gonna get you out of here, okay?

01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:50.300
Don't be scared.

01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:52.010
Hi.

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.806
Pleasure to meet you.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:56.098
Huh?

01:13:57.349 --> 01:13:57.975
It's for the chocolate.

01:13:59.309 --> 01:13:59.810
You're welcome.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.991
(growling)

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:15.534
No!

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:29.006
(screaming)

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:32.217
Hold on, Kari!

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.555
Hold on, Kari!

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:43.145
(screaming)

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:55.824
He was trying to protect you.

01:14:56.283 --> 01:14:58.827
We are not the bad guys!

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:02.873
Ethel!

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:04.625
My baby, my baby.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:06.210
Thank you, Eddie.

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:06.877
You're welcome.

01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:13.509
You gotta be kidding me.

01:15:22.142 --> 01:15:23.894
Get in!

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:24.937
Whoa, whoa!

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:25.896
Get out!

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:26.647
Stop!

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:29.066
Hey!

01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:31.735
Come on.

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:45.791
Call, bring me that Codex.

01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:51.213
What's that noise?

01:15:52.297 --> 01:15:53.340
She found home.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:58.887
(growling)

01:15:58.929 --> 01:15:59.554
Oh, shit.

01:16:02.766 --> 01:16:09.273
(screaming)

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:23.203
Get out!

01:16:23.453 --> 01:16:24.413
Get out of here!

01:16:24.579 --> 01:16:25.455
Get out of here!

01:16:25.455 --> 01:16:25.914
Take cover!

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:26.832
Take cover!

01:16:27.207 --> 01:16:30.544
I got you.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:35.173
(screaming)

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:39.678
She saved us.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:43.098
I saw no one thing
that's gonna distract them.

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:43.932
Copy.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:49.104
Get back to their van!

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:50.480
Come on!

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:51.481
Kari, Kari!

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:55.068
I'm gonna round them up.

01:16:55.068 --> 01:16:56.278
Have the chopper follow me.

01:16:58.989 --> 01:16:59.781
Go, go, go!

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:00.407
Go!

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:05.871
(growling)

01:17:07.914 --> 01:17:08.123
Go!

01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:19.051
He's leading them to a kill box.

01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:20.344
When you get a lock, vaporize them!

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:29.227
(gunfire)

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:31.730
Shit!

01:17:35.275 --> 01:17:37.486
(screaming)

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:46.870
We're back.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.914
Okay, okay, hold it.

01:17:49.289 --> 01:17:49.790
Come on, kids.

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:50.874
Go, come on!

01:17:51.541 --> 01:17:51.875
Kari, honey.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:53.710
Thank you.

01:17:55.879 --> 01:17:57.089
Aliens suck!

01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:06.473
(growling)

01:18:06.473 --> 01:18:07.265
(growling)

01:18:07.974 --> 01:18:14.106
(growling)

01:18:21.446 --> 01:18:21.822
Light them up!

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:22.781
Copy that.

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:35.585
Torque eliminate.

01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:37.170
(growling)

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:42.634
Thompson down!

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:44.386
It's coming down, go!

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:50.350
(growling)

01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:54.896
(screaming)

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:55.605
(growling)

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:08.577
Close!

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:10.454
I'll do it!

01:19:19.796 --> 01:19:20.964
Let's finish this.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:22.174
With pleasure.

01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:30.015
The chopper blades.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:37.689
(growling)

01:19:49.826 --> 01:19:54.122
I got you.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.129
Get him somewhere safe.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:04.508
Oh boy.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:11.640
(growling)

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:30.784
I'm so sorry.

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:32.035
I'm sorry.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.329
Okay, okay.

01:20:36.456 --> 01:20:43.046
(growling)

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:45.840
No.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.018
Go on.

01:20:57.477 --> 01:20:59.688
Okay, okay.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.151
Still living your brother's dream.

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:12.742
(growling)

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:19.249
I'm coming.

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:20.500
I'm coming.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.752
Get over here!

01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:23.378
Get over here!

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:23.670
Get over here!

01:21:23.753 --> 01:21:24.170
Go, go!

01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:26.631
(growling)

01:21:36.349 --> 01:21:47.110
(growling)

01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:52.782
I'm proud of you, Eddie.

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:54.451
You did it all yourself.

01:21:56.828 --> 01:21:57.829
Well, some of it.

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:00.832
(growling)

01:22:06.379 --> 01:22:10.425
(growling)

01:22:14.679 --> 01:22:17.349
I really would
have liked to have seen her.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:23.063
Who?

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:24.898
Lady Liberty.

01:22:26.983 --> 01:22:27.525
Oh yeah.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:30.070
Oh yeah.

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:32.405
Yeah, well, we're going.

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:37.994
We're gonna go just as
soon as we get out of here.

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:41.706
They're just going to keep coming.

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:44.376
We'll never leave this place, friend.

01:22:45.585 --> 01:22:46.211
Oh God.

01:22:56.888 --> 01:22:57.597
We were alive.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.769
I thought we were
gonna be the lethal protector.

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.316
We are.

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:11.361
That's what this is.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:46.229
Yeah. (dramatic music)

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:49.232
All right.

01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:54.821
All right.

01:24:02.078 --> 01:24:05.915
(growling)

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:07.625
Come again, us.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:17.135
(growling)

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:36.029
(growling) (growling)

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:36.738
(growling) (panting)

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:44.204
(growling)

01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:46.206
(growling)

01:24:46.206 --> 01:25:03.681
(growling) (panting)

01:25:03.681 --> 01:25:08.978
(growling)

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:12.649
Go.

01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:14.359
Go.

01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:21.950
Oh my God.

01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:26.287
(growling)

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:31.042
(growling)

01:25:31.042 --> 01:25:32.836
(growling)

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:36.381
What are you doing?

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:41.427
I'll never forget you.

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:48.184
Don't forget me, either, Eddie.

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.686
No.

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:51.062
Time to go.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:55.233
Strickland.

01:25:55.608 --> 01:25:56.526
Strickland authorized.

01:25:59.070 --> 01:25:59.529
No.

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:08.079
Oh God.

01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:18.798
Strickland.

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:19.924
Strickland authorized.

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.176
(growling)

01:26:28.057 --> 01:26:33.104
(growling)

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:34.397
Oh.

01:26:36.065 --> 01:26:36.274
Huh?

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:37.984
Huh?

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.241
It's just by for now.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.661
(growling)

01:26:48.661 --> 01:26:54.667
(growling)

01:26:54.667 --> 01:26:58.463
(growling) (growling) (growling)

01:27:02.508 --> 01:27:02.926
No.

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:06.888
No.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:08.681
No, no.

01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:19.943
(growling)

01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:31.579
(growling)

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:33.081
(growling)

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.374
(growling)

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:34.666
No.

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:37.418
(growling)

01:27:54.686 --> 01:28:06.948
(growling)

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:07.949
(growling)

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:09.575
(growling)

01:28:13.162 --> 01:28:13.955
No, Eddie.

01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:16.749
(crying)

01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:26.926
(growling)

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.092
(crying)

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:08.885
Nureka.

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:28.988
(growling)

01:29:34.452 --> 01:29:34.911
Hey, buddy.

01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.123
I just had a crazy dream.

01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:47.381
Buddy.

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:49.050
He's not coming back.

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:58.142
He's coming back.

01:29:58.142 --> 01:29:58.976
But I need him back.

01:30:00.269 --> 01:30:01.562
He wasn't meant for this place.

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:03.648
You couldn't have kept him.

01:30:05.316 --> 01:30:06.442
And he couldn't have kept you.

01:30:08.444 --> 01:30:11.864
For your bravery, you
both have the heartfelt thanks

01:30:11.864 --> 01:30:12.907
of a grateful nation.

01:30:16.327 --> 01:30:17.745
Eddie, you're free
to start your life again.

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:20.790
Everything that happened in San Francisco

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:22.250
and in the last few days,

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:24.877
you'll be considered expunged.

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:33.177
Just so you're clear, of course,

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.639
you have a breath of
word of this to any living soul,

01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:39.308
you will spend the rest of that life

01:30:39.308 --> 01:30:42.353
in the coldest, darkest hole imaginable.

01:30:44.188 --> 01:30:45.857
Good luck, Eddie.

01:30:53.781 --> 01:30:56.367
(upbeat music)

01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:26.355
(upbeat music)

01:31:53.799 --> 01:32:21.035
(upbeat music)

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:22.703
I won't forget you, buddy.

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:29.585
(upbeat music)

01:32:29.585 --> 01:32:32.129
Memories bring back
memories bring back y'all

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.969
Memories bring back
memories bring back y'all

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.682
Memories bring back
memories bring back y'all

01:32:45.351 --> 01:32:49.397
Give me one last
dance before we hit the ground

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:51.148
(upbeat music)

01:32:53.776 --> 01:32:56.153
(upbeat music)

01:32:56.195 --> 01:32:59.824
Push me into
overdrive what a lovely way to go

01:33:00.116 --> 01:33:03.286
If you're with me by
my side I'm in for the ride

01:33:04.453 --> 01:33:05.871
(upbeat music)

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:11.335
There's no running no
escape all the venom never waits

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.630
Once you feel it
hits your veins it's too late

01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:15.506
You're gone

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:18.301
(upbeat music)
