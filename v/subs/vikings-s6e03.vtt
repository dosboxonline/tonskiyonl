to the feast.

Would you like
some horse liver?

01:34.181 --> 01:37.009
It's sacred
to the god Freya.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.447
I know.

01:42.754 --> 01:43.886
Thank you.

They don't serve mead
where I've been staying.

02:03.384 --> 02:08.258
I've been thinking about
contradictory fortunes.

02:08.302 --> 02:11.914
If it's true that
the Norns spin our fate,

02:11.957 --> 02:17.006
then what helps them
to make their decisions?

02:17.049 --> 02:19.182
Are you listening to me?

02:19.226 --> 02:21.445
I took your kingdom from you!

02:22.185 --> 02:23.839
Is it arbitrary?

02:23.882 --> 02:28.887
Or is there something
that is the reason for it all?

02:28.931 --> 02:30.237
Are we, for example,

02:30.280 --> 02:33.153
punished for our hubris?

02:33.196 --> 02:35.938
For taking
the gods for granted?

02:35.981 --> 02:39.115
Do we have the fate
that we deserve?

02:40.464 --> 02:42.249
Perhaps you are right.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.685
That is not an argument!

02:43.728 --> 02:46.818
You are my prisoner,
at my mercy!

02:46.862 --> 02:50.344
Is that something
that you deserve?

02:50.387 --> 02:52.128
In other words,

02:52.172 --> 02:55.436
it is nothing
to do with me?

02:59.657 --> 03:01.833
You...

03:01.877 --> 03:05.881
Found me laying badly
wounded on the battlefield.

03:09.363 --> 03:13.236
If you would have
left me there to die,

03:13.280 --> 03:17.197
of course, this
would be different!

03:19.764 --> 03:21.331
What is fated

03:23.420 --> 03:26.336
is acted out by all of us.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.034
It's just that
we can't help it.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.819
We can't help it.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.386
[King Olaf]
I still cannot believe

03:32.429 --> 03:34.301

03:34.344 --> 03:36.999
play with us
for their amusement.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.261
[laughing]

03:38.305 --> 03:40.350
One thing I am certain of.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.178
The Christian God

03:42.222 --> 03:44.267
will destroy our gods.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.531
How can you be so sure?

03:47.575 --> 03:50.926
I feel it in my liver.

03:52.362 --> 03:59.326

safely reached Valhalla.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.677
[scoffs]

04:02.720 --> 04:04.200
But one thing
I am thinking of,

04:04.244 --> 04:07.290
is whether to have
you killed or not.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.249

[Ivar] Forgive me for
asking, Prince Oleg.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.860
Was the prophecy true?

05:38.903 --> 05:41.166
Was something terrible
really going to happen
to your brother?

05:43.430 --> 05:44.561
No.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.346
Not as far as I know.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.348
I was bluffing.

05:49.131 --> 05:53.440
Bluffing? Huh.

05:53.483 --> 05:56.660
[Ivar] But then how
did you know about
Prince Dir's new wife?

05:56.704 --> 06:00.098
That seems astonishing.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.535
Not at all.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.668
It was rather easy.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.584
Anna used to
be one of my mistresses.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.325
One day she
asked my permission

06:09.369 --> 06:10.457
to marry my brother.

06:11.588 --> 06:14.069
Since I was
growing tired of her,

06:14.112 --> 06:16.506
I granted her request.

06:16.550 --> 06:19.379
She was only playing
at being terrified.

[Oleg chuckles]

06:33.480 --> 06:35.090
Why do you follow me?

06:39.094 --> 06:41.792
Everywhere I go,
I feel your eyes upon me.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.100
I think I should be with you.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.493
[Bjorn] Why?

06:46.536 --> 06:49.409
I know I'll bring you luck
and good fortune.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.280
How can you say that?

06:51.323 --> 06:53.456
Because it is true.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.284
Every man
I choose to go with

06:55.327 --> 06:56.764
has luck and good fortune.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.332
You are wasting your time.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.596
I have a wife.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.425
I love her.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.600
What is that to me?

07:09.254 --> 07:11.387
I can help you.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.998
If you were with me,
you would never
doubt yourself again.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.827
And you will be
the greatest king
to ever live.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.615
You have chosen
the wrong man.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.574
I told you,
I am not free.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.750
I know.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.100
That is your problem.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.320
But you can solve it.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.714
After all,

07:35.063 --> 07:36.281
you're the King.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.015
[woman 4] Do you think
she will be here?

08:58.059 --> 08:59.539
-[woman 3] It's possible.
-[woman 5] I hope so.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.844
[woman 3]
One can only hope!

09:00.888 --> 09:02.585
[woman 4]
I've heard she's very tall.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.935
[woman 5] So many stories!

09:04.979 --> 09:07.285
[woman 4] Is that her?
Is that... Is that her?

09:09.331 --> 09:10.767
Are you Lagertha?

09:11.594 --> 09:12.813
[Lagertha] Yes.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.425
Are you all
from this village?

09:16.468 --> 09:17.600
[second woman] Not all of us.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.689
Some of us live
in another village

09:19.733 --> 09:22.170
about 15 rost away.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.519
But we all wanted
to come and see

09:23.563 --> 09:24.999
if the rumors were true.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.394
Where are your menfolk?

09:30.831 --> 09:32.789
Most of us are widows.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.835
We lost our men,

09:34.878 --> 09:37.707
our husbands
and older sons

09:37.751 --> 09:39.840
in storms and battles.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.277
Now we have to raise
our children alone.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.061
Life is hard.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.673
I understand.

09:50.764 --> 09:54.158
But perhaps it would
be better if I share it
with you all.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.970
[shaky breathing]

10:27.627 --> 10:28.671
Hvitserk.

10:28.715 --> 10:29.759
[burps]

10:29.803 --> 10:30.847
Hvitserk.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.110
It hurts me.

10:33.154 --> 10:34.938
It hurts all of us
to see you so.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.030
I walk between the places.

10:43.773 --> 10:44.948
I see the place

10:44.992 --> 10:46.689
where my mother
was struck down.

10:51.607 --> 10:54.610
And I see the place
Thora was burned alive.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.053
And everywhere else...

11:06.840 --> 11:08.015
I see Ivar.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.975
He's always with me.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.545
Right now,
he's over there,

11:17.807 --> 11:19.026
looking at me.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.855
Looking at me,

11:23.247 --> 11:24.292
waiting.

11:25.554 --> 11:26.686
Waiting for me.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.732
He isn't.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.647
-He isn't, Hvitserk.
-Of course he is.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.172
You can't see him. Hmm?

11:37.784 --> 11:39.568
I can see him.

11:39.611 --> 11:40.656
It's the ghosts.

11:42.571 --> 11:43.615
Ghosts.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.447
You're with child?

11:50.666 --> 11:51.711
Yes.

11:53.930 --> 11:58.282
I've always wanted
a son or a daughter.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.720
I don't mind.

12:03.635 --> 12:04.767
Just someone to love.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.944
[weeps]

12:21.566 --> 12:22.916
[indistinct chattering]

12:46.635 --> 13:00.431
[Oleg in Russian]

13:00.475 --> 13:01.519
[panting]

13:03.695 --> 13:04.827
[Lagertha] Tell me,

13:04.871 --> 13:06.829
you intend to look for some

13:06.873 --> 13:09.832
undiscovered land
in the middle of the ocean.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.617
Are you really going
to take Hali and Asa

13:12.661 --> 13:17.100
with you on such
a hazardous expedition?

13:18.580 --> 13:19.711
I hadn't thought.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.888
I have.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.107
What are you
suggesting, Lagertha?

13:24.151 --> 13:26.893
I'm suggesting you
leave them with me.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.938
I would be happy
to look after them

13:28.982 --> 13:31.114
and I could teach
them many skills

13:31.158 --> 13:33.247
that they would need in life.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.119
And if there was any danger
of you being lonely?

13:36.903 --> 13:38.513
Then, it's true,

13:38.556 --> 13:41.037
they would give me
companionship.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.734
I don't deny that.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.302
What do you say?

13:45.346 --> 13:47.827
If the children agree,
I think it is a good idea.

13:48.915 --> 13:49.785
And so do I.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.961
-Hmm.
-Mmm.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.834
And, since you are pregnant
with our first child,

13:54.877 --> 13:56.400
maybe you should
stay home as well?

14:00.013 --> 14:01.797
What did you say?

14:01.841 --> 14:02.885
I just said that since you--

14:02.929 --> 14:04.495
I heard what you said!

14:04.539 --> 14:05.888
And the way you said it.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.672
So dismissively.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.805
Oh, you poor little woman.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.852
So weak, so helpless.

14:12.895 --> 14:16.507
You're with child.
We must look after you.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.815
You know
that's not what I meant.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.860
Hmm.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.341
[sighs]

14:24.385 --> 14:27.127
Let me tell you something,
Ubbe Lothbrok.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.607
I will not be left behind.

14:29.651 --> 14:33.002
I have had enough
of compromising
with the men in my life.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.874
Wherever you go,
I will go, too.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.398
Whatever you do,
I will do, too.

14:37.441 --> 14:38.834
Even till the ends
of the earth.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.357
Even to the ends of endurance.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.316
Isn't that
what love means, hmm?

14:42.925 --> 14:44.274
Isn't it?

14:47.669 --> 14:48.931
-Skol.
-Skol.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.850
Going to King Harald's aid?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.896
Are you sure?

14:56.939 --> 14:58.854
Why? Do you think
I'm crazy, too?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.987
-That I shouldn't do it?
-No.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.337
If you trust yourself,
then it is
the right thing to do.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.208
Whatever anyone else says.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.473
Hvitserk is in a bad place.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.866
I know.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.999
I persuaded Ubbe and Torvi
to delay their voyage,

15:13.042 --> 15:15.349
so they can look after him.

15:15.392 --> 15:18.178
And look after
Kattegat with you.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.963
What do you want us to do,
for Kattegat?

15:21.007 --> 15:23.313
I want to put Kattegat
on the map.

15:23.357 --> 15:26.490
I want the world to know
we're open for business.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.189
I wouldn't want anything
to stop that.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.755
And what about you?

15:32.540 --> 15:33.758
What about me?

15:34.759 --> 15:36.631
Are you still a Viking?

15:36.674 --> 15:38.502
Do you still secretly
want to be on the move,

15:38.546 --> 15:40.983
always traveling
and never arriving?

15:41.027 --> 15:43.116
No. Of course not.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.988
I've found my fixed point.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.685
Here is my space.

[all speaking Old Norse]

16:48.137 --> 16:49.182
[all repeating in Old Norse]

17:47.153 --> 17:49.111
Come here, Bjorn.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.070
Don't deny the gods.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.207
[Viking 1] Ready the sail!

18:42.208 --> 18:43.861
[Viking 2] Row!

18:43.905 --> 18:44.906
[Viking 3] Row!

18:47.952 --> 18:48.997
[Viking 2] Watch the side!

18:53.828 --> 18:54.829
[Viking 3] Row!

18:58.006 --> 19:00.530
[Viking 1] Throw me
the rope! Again!

19:02.315 --> 19:03.620
[Viking 3] Pull it!

19:03.664 --> 19:05.056
[Viking 2] You're
dragging behind!

19:06.275 --> 19:07.276
[Viking 1] Pull!

19:08.843 --> 19:09.974
Keep up!

19:11.193 --> 19:13.239
[Viking 3] Hey, row!

19:13.282 --> 19:14.762
Hey, row!

19:15.893 --> 19:18.113
[Viking 4] I will!

19:18.157 --> 19:21.029
Your father has asked us
to care for Kattegat
in his absence

19:21.072 --> 19:22.465
before we journey west.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.641
So, help Lagertha
with the farm
and the animals.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.991
And remember
that we love you,

19:27.035 --> 19:29.472
and we will think
about you every day,
wherever we are.

19:29.516 --> 19:33.650
And one day,
we will all be
together again.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.871
That's what
I'll pray to the gods for.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.265
That is what
we will all pray for, Asa.

19:42.703 --> 19:43.747
My darlings.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.272
What can I say?

19:46.315 --> 19:48.187
Ubbe has said it all.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.232
You can say that you love us.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.321
I love you both
with all my heart.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.280
You are my gift
from the gods.

19:54.323 --> 19:57.196
That is why I am so happy
that Lagertha will be
looking after you,

19:57.239 --> 19:59.110
and teaching you.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.814
Come.

20:06.857 --> 20:09.251
We leave them
in your safe hands.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.775
Take care of yourself, Torvi.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.124
And you, Ubbe.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.996
No more farewells.

20:15.039 --> 20:18.217
We will all
see each other again,
somehow, someday.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.219
Of that I am sure.

20:28.314 --> 20:31.534
I'm thinking of Kattegat.
What about...

20:32.883 --> 20:34.233
The invasion?

20:36.191 --> 20:39.020
I've started to make plans.
Don't worry.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.026
Mmm.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.724
These things take time.

20:47.768 --> 20:51.902
-Preparations are everything.
-Yes.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.775
First we'll have to
deal with my brother.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.167
Hmm?

20:56.211 --> 20:57.343
What do you mean?

20:57.386 --> 21:00.520
He had the audacity
to threaten me.

21:00.563 --> 21:03.653
For that,
there is no excuse.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.177
I never thought that
he was so ambitious.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.570
[Ivar chuckles]

21:07.614 --> 21:10.225
I see,
now that he is a...

21:10.269 --> 21:13.359
Real threat to the kingdom,

21:13.402 --> 21:14.925
and to me.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.975
He thinks he's a lion...

21:22.629 --> 21:25.327
But he's just a dog!

21:25.371 --> 21:26.894
[laughing]

21:29.113 --> 21:30.158
[both barking]

21:35.424 --> 21:37.339
[indistinct chatter]

21:37.383 --> 21:39.298
[music playing]

21:46.305 --> 21:47.480
That one.

21:48.829 --> 21:50.526
[grunting]

21:56.793 --> 21:57.881
Ah!

21:58.926 --> 22:00.231
[all laughing]

22:06.325 --> 22:07.369
[echoing laughter]

22:39.096 --> 22:41.011
[grunting]

22:41.055 --> 22:42.665
[all screaming]

22:44.406 --> 22:45.842
[groans]

23:04.557 --> 23:05.558
[grunts]

23:06.472 --> 23:07.777
[Lagertha] Listen.

23:11.738 --> 23:16.133
Who can hear the sound
of grass growing?

23:16.177 --> 23:20.703
The sound of wool
on a sheep's back, growing?

23:20.747 --> 23:25.273
Who needs less sleep
than a bird?

23:25.316 --> 23:28.450
Who is so eagle-eyed that,

23:28.494 --> 23:30.365
by day and by night,

23:30.409 --> 23:35.457
he can see the least movement
a hundred leagues away?

23:35.501 --> 23:38.199
[both] Heimdall.

23:38.242 --> 23:40.680
[Lagertha] Yes, Heimdall.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.378
But who could tell
it was Heimdall,

23:43.422 --> 23:46.512
that figure on the seashore?

23:46.555 --> 23:48.644
Heimdall,
the guardian of the gods,

23:48.688 --> 23:53.170
had left his horn Gjall
safe in Mirmir's spring.

23:53.214 --> 23:56.478
He left Gulltoppr,
his golden-maned stallion

23:56.522 --> 23:58.349
behind a stable door,

23:58.393 --> 24:04.834
and he strode alone
across the flaming
three-strand rainbow bridge

24:04.878 --> 24:08.403
from Asgard to Midgard.

24:10.057 --> 24:14.931
It was spring
and time for sowing.

24:16.977 --> 24:20.589
The god walked away
from Bifrost over

24:21.503 --> 24:24.245
soft green ground,

24:24.288 --> 24:31.034
and soon he came
to the edge of the earth.

24:31.078 --> 24:36.562
All day, as the sun
fled west from the wolf,

24:36.605 --> 24:40.870
he picked his way
along the wavy line

24:40.914 --> 24:44.918
where the soil
meets the deep sea.

24:55.668 --> 24:56.756
[White Hair grunts]

25:11.945 --> 25:13.947
[grunts]

25:13.990 --> 25:14.774
[chuckles]

25:14.817 --> 25:20.301
[both speaking Russian]

25:20.301 --> 25:29.702
[both speaking Russian]

25:41.540 --> 25:42.584
[dog barks]

25:42.628 --> 25:43.933
[barks]

25:46.240 --> 25:52.028
[continues in Russian]

25:52.072 --> 25:53.421
[grunts]

26:30.110 --> 26:31.241
[grunts]

26:34.723 --> 26:37.639
-Oh. Oh. [chuckles]
-[barks]

26:38.640 --> 26:40.294
[door opening]

26:46.648 --> 26:52.132
[both speaking Russian]

26:52.132 --> 27:01.532
[both speaking Russian]

27:51.234 --> 27:52.235
Mmm-hmm.

27:54.760 --> 27:55.761
[door closes]

27:57.545 --> 27:58.720
[shouts in Russian]

28:05.684 --> 28:08.904
[Ubbe] I feel strange,
sitting here on this chair.

28:08.948 --> 28:12.560
It was once occupied
by my father,
King Ragnar,

28:12.603 --> 28:14.040
my mother,
Queen Aslaug,

28:14.780 --> 28:16.782
Lagertha,

28:16.825 --> 28:19.741
and now,
King Bjorn Ironside,
my brother.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.831
I do so only temporarily,
of course.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.746
Since King Bjorn
will soon return,

28:24.790 --> 28:27.444
his mission accomplished.
For who could doubt that?

28:28.445 --> 28:29.751
But, in the meantime,

28:30.752 --> 28:33.146
life goes on.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.627
Important matters
cannot be left undone
or unattended.

28:36.671 --> 28:39.456
If you have urgent issues
with one of your neighbors,

28:39.500 --> 28:40.936
your family,

28:40.980 --> 28:42.808
or you seek justice for
a crime committed against you,

28:42.851 --> 28:43.983
you can come to me privately.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.811
And as your Law Giver,

28:45.854 --> 28:48.117
I will do my utmost
to resolve them.

28:48.161 --> 28:52.295
Now, looking beyond Kattegat,

28:52.339 --> 28:55.559
I want to announce
that I have organized
trade missions

28:55.603 --> 28:58.737
with King Alfred in England
and Duke Rollo in Frankia.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.522
My brother Hvitserk...

29:04.830 --> 29:10.792
Hvitserk is going to
lead a trade mission
along the Silk Road,

29:10.836 --> 29:13.055
trading along its long route,

29:13.099 --> 29:15.449
perhaps even to China.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.364
[all laughing]

29:17.407 --> 29:19.453
Why not, huh?

29:19.496 --> 29:21.368
China seems a long way
away to us now,

29:22.064 --> 29:23.587
but one day perhaps

29:23.631 --> 29:24.806
it will seem a lot closer,

29:24.850 --> 29:26.416
almost like a neighbor.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.812
As will those countries
that King Bjorn visited

29:30.856 --> 29:33.597
along the Mediterranean Sea.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.730
-We are Viking!
-[crowd murmurs agreement]

29:35.774 --> 29:36.992
We are travelers.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.646
-[all] Yes!
-And we are traders.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.126
-That is our destiny!
-[crowd murmurs agreement]

29:40.169 --> 29:41.823
King Bjorn was right.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.172
We must go out into the world,

29:43.216 --> 29:45.000
and the world
must come to us.

29:45.044 --> 29:48.351
-[calls out agreement]
-If you believe in our future,

29:48.395 --> 29:50.832
if you believe in the
future of our children,

29:50.876 --> 29:53.400
then I ask you to support
and to join them.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.881
-[sporadic cheering]
-Together...

29:56.882 --> 29:58.274
We will make Kattegat

29:58.318 --> 30:00.886
one of the greatest cities
in the world!

30:00.929 --> 30:02.801
[crowd cheering]

30:06.326 --> 30:07.501
Where's Hvitserk?

30:08.632 --> 30:09.677
I'll find him.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.077
[shaky breathing]

30:18.120 --> 30:19.861
[Amma knocking at door]
Hvitserk!

30:19.905 --> 30:21.515
-Who is it?
-[Amma] Hvitserk!

30:21.558 --> 30:22.559
Go away!

30:22.603 --> 30:24.561
-[Amma] Open the door!
-Go away!

30:24.605 --> 30:26.912
-[Amma] Please, Hvitserk!
-You, go away!

30:28.304 --> 30:29.479
[Amma] Hvitserk!

30:31.264 --> 30:32.874
[Amma knocking at door] Open!

30:37.618 --> 30:38.749
[Amma] Hvitserk?

30:39.925 --> 30:40.969
Hvitserk.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.754
Hvitserk.

30:43.798 --> 30:44.843
Hvitserk!

30:48.847 --> 30:49.935
[panting]

30:51.850 --> 30:57.116
Thora. Oh, Thora. Oh, no.

30:57.159 --> 31:02.382
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Thora.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.385
[weeping]

31:07.474 --> 31:10.433
-Oh, Hvitserk.
-I'm so sorry. [sobbing]

31:16.831 --> 31:17.832
[second woman] Lagertha!

31:18.615 --> 31:19.616
Lagertha!

31:21.880 --> 31:24.143
[third woman] Two days ago
we were attacked.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.275
Bandits?

31:27.015 --> 31:29.235
They attacked at night.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.890
They stole our grain stores

31:31.933 --> 31:33.543
and our animals.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.461
They killed our sons.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.596
My baby was crying.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.251
They picked him up

31:45.294 --> 31:47.731
and smashed his brains out.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.213
They raped me.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.347
They raped all of us.

31:55.391 --> 31:58.046
We didn't know who to tell.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.092
Our menfolk are dead.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.658
We thought of you.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.630
We are so afraid

32:16.673 --> 32:17.936
they might come back.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.983
[Lagertha] Oh,
they will come back.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.506
Of that I'm certain.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.733
We must all prepare
for another attack.

32:38.086 --> 32:39.609
[door opens]

32:40.088 --> 32:41.481
[laughing]

32:41.524 --> 32:43.700
-[door closes]
-How are we today?

32:43.744 --> 32:46.268
Oh, I had a long sleep,

32:46.312 --> 32:49.010
so I am well rested
and, on the whole,

32:49.054 --> 32:50.316
pretty cheerful.

32:50.359 --> 32:52.013
Thank you for asking.

32:52.057 --> 32:52.971
Are you hungry?

32:53.014 --> 32:54.494
What is that you're making?

32:56.322 --> 32:58.237
It's hard to describe.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.021
But it's my very own recipe.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.806
Ah, then I'm sure
I will enjoy it.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.983
It is served cold?

33:05.026 --> 33:06.201
How else would it be served?

33:07.115 --> 33:08.682
Of course. [chuckles]

33:08.725 --> 33:12.381
Uh... If it wasn't
for you, Canute,

33:13.165 --> 33:14.340
I'd be dead.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.126
I had no orders to kill you.

33:18.170 --> 33:22.826
What can I offer you
to set me free?

33:27.092 --> 33:29.007
I've always
wanted to be a king.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.530
-A king?
-Can you imagine?

33:30.573 --> 33:31.835
[chuckling]

33:34.099 --> 33:37.145
-King Canute!
-[laughing]

33:37.189 --> 33:38.886
Of course, a king,

33:39.539 --> 33:40.627
a king!

33:43.021 --> 33:44.500
I could make you a king.

33:50.680 --> 33:51.855
Really?

33:53.814 --> 33:54.815
I swear.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.649
And I swear you are lying.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.307
You do not have power.

34:08.350 --> 34:10.048
You just have words.

34:10.091 --> 34:13.138
So, you're a philosopher also?

34:13.181 --> 34:15.575
No. I am more
the practical kind.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.186
Do you want some more stew?

34:18.230 --> 34:22.364
I think I might just
wait until the point
of my death.

34:23.539 --> 34:26.064
-Well, it won't go cold.
-[laughing]

34:28.153 --> 34:29.850
Do you really have to go?

34:29.893 --> 34:31.808
I enjoy your conversation

34:31.852 --> 34:34.898
almost as much
as I enjoy your cooking.

34:34.942 --> 34:37.771
I'm afraid I have
more urgent matters
to attend to.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.078
It seems Bjorn Ironside

34:40.121 --> 34:43.646
has arrived on our shore
with a very large fleet.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.822
Possibly he has
come to rescue you.

34:57.138 --> 34:58.835
[indistinct chattering]

35:05.842 --> 35:06.843
Sit down.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.195
King Bjorn.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.153
What is the news?

35:12.197 --> 35:13.807
King Harald is still alive.

35:13.850 --> 35:17.593
But we fear that
King Olaf could
execute him at any time.

35:17.637 --> 35:21.380
There seems no reason
or logic to his actions.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.211
Trust me.

35:26.254 --> 35:29.170
When I attack,
the element of surprise
will work in our favor.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.564
You will stay with us?

35:33.218 --> 35:35.176
-Wouldn't it be better if--
-No.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.786
It wouldn't be better.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.527
Believe me.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.096
It's a question of trust.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.261
[indistinct chattering]

37:00.305 --> 37:02.263
[in Old Norse]

37:02.307 --> 37:03.569
[repeats Old Norse words]

37:09.096 --> 37:10.184
[laughing]

37:13.274 --> 37:14.884
Mmm.

37:16.277 --> 37:17.496
Oh.

37:32.946 --> 37:36.079
[in Russian]

37:36.123 --> 37:40.910
[in Old Norse]

37:40.954 --> 37:42.260
[dog barking]

37:57.144 --> 37:58.363
[indistinct chattering]

38:00.365 --> 38:03.324
[in Russian]

38:03.368 --> 38:04.934
[dog continues barking]

38:17.382 --> 38:19.122
[indistinct chattering]

38:50.893 --> 38:51.894
[groaning]

38:59.119 --> 39:00.947
[cries out]

39:00.990 --> 39:02.122
[imitates barking]

39:04.472 --> 39:06.387
[chuckles]

39:06.431 --> 39:07.649
[cries out]

39:24.449 --> 39:26.494
[King Olaf] Come and see.

39:26.538 --> 39:29.149
Oh, come and see.
Come and see.

39:30.106 --> 39:32.370
Oath breakers,

39:33.283 --> 39:36.983
philanderers...

39:37.026 --> 39:39.507
And murderers

39:39.551 --> 39:43.729
wade through the sea.

39:43.772 --> 39:47.254
Nidhogg, too,
will escape the flame.

39:49.082 --> 39:50.475
[panting]

39:52.433 --> 39:54.000
[Ketill] Where are you going?

39:55.436 --> 39:56.437
Stay with us.

39:57.656 --> 40:01.137
[King Olaf]
And under Yggdrasill

40:01.181 --> 40:05.446
he will suck the blood

40:05.490 --> 40:08.536
from the bodies of the dead.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.408
There is something
in the water.

40:11.757 --> 40:14.150
I can't see any guards.

40:14.194 --> 40:15.500
I can't see anyone.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.199
[explosion]

40:26.424 --> 40:27.642
But they can see us.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.863
Retreat! Retreat!

40:30.906 --> 40:33.387
Under the water! Go under!

40:33.431 --> 40:35.345
See, come and see!

40:35.389 --> 40:37.478
Come and see!

40:37.522 --> 40:40.873
Come and see
the wreck of humanity.

40:44.267 --> 40:48.010
The wreck of humanity!

40:52.580 --> 40:54.103
Broken heads.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.458
Spilled guts!

41:02.547 --> 41:04.331
[grunting]

41:04.374 --> 41:06.855
Scorched flesh!

41:08.466 --> 41:11.773
[King Olaf's warrior
in Old Norse]

41:12.426 --> 41:13.558
[grunting]

41:18.432 --> 41:22.262
[King Olaf] The young
at each other's throats!

41:22.305 --> 41:24.133
[all screaming]

41:24.177 --> 41:28.486
Upon a sea of corpses!

41:30.575 --> 41:32.577
[Bjorn] Retreat! Go under!

41:32.620 --> 41:33.665
Go under!

41:38.626 --> 41:39.845
[men screaming]

41:40.541 --> 41:41.934
Retreat!

41:42.848 --> 41:44.153
[King Olaf's warrior] Loose!

41:45.546 --> 41:49.289
[King Olaf] A feast!
A feast for the gods!

41:49.332 --> 41:50.638
[grunting and screaming]

42:14.706 --> 42:17.099
What do we do now,
Bjorn Ironside?

42:18.405 --> 42:19.754
[panting]

42:23.497 --> 42:27.457
[King Olaf] Come
and see the wreck...

42:27.501 --> 42:29.198
The wreck of humanity.

42:34.856 --> 42:37.293
The wreck of humanity.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.645
The wreck of humanity.

42:49.567 --> 43:04.451
[music playing]

43:04.494 --> 43:19.422
[music playing]

43:19.422 --> 43:24.471
[music playing]

43:24.514 --> 43:39.442
[music playing]

43:39.442 --> 43:42.576
[music playing]
