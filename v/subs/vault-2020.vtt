SEPTEMBER 2009

03:39.013 --> 03:43.097
Walter, there's 30 million here.
We can't sit here all day. The Customs--

03:43.263 --> 03:46.097
We stay until the job's done.

03:46.263 --> 03:49.680
James, we're clear but it won't last.

03:49.847 --> 03:51.138
Any sign?

03:51.972 --> 03:53.638
<i> No. </i>

03:54.763 --> 03:57.763
<i> But there's still one last left to check. </i>

04:19.430 --> 04:22.055
<i> OK, I'm going in. </i>

04:22.222 --> 04:26.888
<i> No, you won't get though with the gear.
-It's not a problem. </i>

04:30.638 --> 04:32.888
He can't free dive.
It's on a slope.

04:33.096 --> 04:34.680
He's made his choice.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.222
How long has he been under?

05:08.388 --> 05:10.638
Two minutes.

05:16.472 --> 05:21.972
Craig, do you have eyes on James?
<i> -No, maybe he found another one... </i>

05:43.513 --> 05:46.305
<i> Were you worried about me, Walter? </i>

05:46.805 --> 05:49.138
That would suggest I cared, James.

05:49.347 --> 05:53.722
<i>Well, if you didn't before,
you will now. </i>

05:56.597 --> 05:59.972
Bring it up. Bring it home.

06:00.513 --> 06:02.597
The next cage is coming.

06:30.263 --> 06:31.847
Drop it now.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.555
<i> Atlantis crew,
this is Spanish customs. </i>

06:45.680 --> 06:49.555
<i> Raise your hands
and prepare to be boarded. </i>

06:55.513 --> 06:57.680
Our conclusions are irrefutable.

06:57.847 --> 07:00.388
The Virgin of Guadalupe
was a Spanish galleon

07:00.555 --> 07:01.847
The Hague International Court
April 2010

07:02.055 --> 07:04.638
and its remains were found
under Spanish jurisdiction.

07:04.763 --> 07:11.097
Mr. Moreland's assertion that the law
of salvage is applicable is preposterous.

07:11.430 --> 07:12.638
This was piracy.

07:12.763 --> 07:16.138
The Spanish claim of ownership
is the only piracy here.

07:16.305 --> 07:19.972
My crew and I
invested years in research...

07:20.138 --> 07:22.722
Mr. Moreland. You have provided
no contract from an owner

07:22.972 --> 07:25.555
nor permission to salvage
from the Spanish authorities.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.972
The cargo salvaged
by the Atlantic Group

07:29.138 --> 07:33.680
is the sole property
of the Spanish crown.

07:35.347 --> 07:37.680
There's gotta be something
the government can do.

07:37.805 --> 07:41.722
I like you, but I helped you
at Her Majesty's pleasure.

07:41.888 --> 07:45.513
Her Majesty's pleasure
was half bounty.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.680
Now she won't get a penny.

07:47.888 --> 07:49.888
She'll live with it.

07:51.013 --> 07:54.680
What if you don't have to?
-We lost. We can't step in.

07:54.847 --> 07:58.388
We lost in court. What if...
-Stop. I'm not hearing this.

07:58.847 --> 08:02.388
We're only weeks before researchers
are granted access.

08:02.555 --> 08:04.972
How long before they realize
what they have?

08:05.138 --> 08:07.055
Still fighting.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.388
Why can't we just live our lives?
-I have lived my life every day.

08:11.555 --> 08:14.513
I mean real life, a normal life.

08:14.888 --> 08:17.722
Do you know how many times
I've been to Paris?

08:17.888 --> 08:21.722
53. And how many times have I climbed
the Eiffel Tower?

08:21.888 --> 08:23.138
None.

08:23.305 --> 08:27.222
Climbing the Eiffel Tower?
That's living a normal life?

08:27.388 --> 08:32.097
It's over, Walter.
You've heard where they're taking it.

CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY
JUNE 2010

10:58.896 --> 11:00.166
Hi.

11:00.347 --> 11:02.138
Sorry I'm late.

11:02.347 --> 11:05.680
It's all right. Take a seat.

11:05.805 --> 11:09.847
I hope no one else
snuck in ahead of us this morning.

11:10.055 --> 11:12.388
You are the first.
-Excellent!

11:13.680 --> 11:16.722
This is a unique position
for a 22-year-old student.

11:16.888 --> 11:20.680
But fitting for the boy genius
whose concrete bell idea

11:20.847 --> 11:24.763
helped Best Oil with a oil spill problem
in the Gulf of Mexico.

11:24.930 --> 11:27.680
The people.
-Excuse me?

11:27.805 --> 11:29.847
I wasn't helping Best Oil.

11:30.004 --> 11:34.103
I was helping the people who were there
for the mess caused by Best Oil.

11:34.222 --> 11:36.263
Yes, of course.

11:36.430 --> 11:40.888
But what matters here is that it was
your idea that solved the problem.

11:41.097 --> 11:44.305
That of yours is precisely the sort of mind
we're looking for.

11:44.472 --> 11:45.680
Thank you. Thank you.

11:45.847 --> 11:51.138
So what we can offer you
is a $400,000 starting salary.

11:51.347 --> 11:52.513
A corner office.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.722
Shares in the company.

11:53.888 --> 11:55.347
A team working under you.

11:55.513 --> 11:58.430
I think I sent you guys a project?
-About vetting wells?

11:58.597 --> 12:01.847
In desert areas.
With a relatively modest investment

12:02.055 --> 12:06.430
you can go a long way towards
eliminating the water problem in the Sahel.

12:06.597 --> 12:12.638
Yes, of course, a magnificent project.
- You never got back to me.

12:12.763 --> 12:15.388
It's not our sector.

12:16.138 --> 12:19.680
Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is for me?

12:19.805 --> 12:23.722
The eight leading multinationals,
and you shit on their hospitality?

12:23.888 --> 12:30.138
Because I don't want to follow you
into the corporate hell scape of Big Oil?

12:30.305 --> 12:33.138
I simply told them the truth, dad.

12:33.305 --> 12:37.055
And their interests
just didn't align with mine interests.

12:37.222 --> 12:39.097
Yes, of course.

12:39.263 --> 12:42.222
Your interests...

12:42.597 --> 12:45.222
So what are those interests then?

12:48.055 --> 12:49.680
Your main course.

12:50.305 --> 12:53.347
<i> Clean the sauce off your shirt
and come with me. </i>

12:58.638 --> 13:00.597
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

13:01.388 --> 13:03.430
Look, Thom, you and I are adults.

13:03.597 --> 13:04.972
<i> What is this? </i>

13:05.138 --> 13:08.722
You can do what you want in life,
but you still need a real job.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.263
Save the world if that's your thing.

13:10.430 --> 13:12.597
<i> I'm the opportunity of a lifetime.</i>

13:12.722 --> 13:13.910
But nothing is free, Thom.

13:14.010 --> 13:17.330
And those companies they are offering you 
the opportunity of a lifetime.

13:17.513 --> 13:19.722
Don't mess it up.

13:21.347 --> 13:23.805
Where are you going?
-Just gonna get some fresh air.

13:29.763 --> 13:32.638
Sir? Your coat.

13:33.597 --> 13:35.138
Thank you.

13:35.305 --> 13:37.638
I-- I didn't...

13:56.722 --> 14:00.638
<i> Thom, come talk to me
before you sign your life away. </i>

14:20.847 --> 14:23.597
No, I'm good for now, actually.

14:23.972 --> 14:25.722
I'll be back.

14:41.746 --> 14:43.712
Hi.
- Hi.

14:45.305 --> 14:49.347
Hello... I... Do we...

14:51.138 --> 14:53.055

14:53.763 --> 14:56.555
...produced by the Vietnamese workshops 
all over...

14:56.680 --> 14:58.680
Claudia!

14:59.763 --> 15:04.013
Claudia Valenti is curating an exhibit 
on Spanish romantics.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.305
What's that?

15:08.263 --> 15:10.138
My new assistant.

15:10.888 --> 15:14.472
You're flying to Madrid tomorrow, yes?
- That's why I came.

15:14.638 --> 15:17.972
You forgot to sign 
the official request for inspection.

15:18.138 --> 15:19.638
I do apologize.

15:19.763 --> 15:21.680
It's okay, forget it.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.055
Here.
- Yes.

15:26.138 --> 15:27.347
And here.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.138
<i>Gracias.</i>
-You're welcome.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.097
Have a safe trip.
-Will do.

15:33.263 --> 15:36.847
Now the rest of you I'm gonna...

15:37.513 --> 15:38.513
Why did you do that?

15:38.680 --> 15:42.680
Do what?
-I saw you stole his wallet.

15:42.805 --> 15:45.305
I thought you did.

15:45.555 --> 15:47.763
Check your pocket.

15:54.097 --> 15:55.972
What did you do?

15:56.138 --> 16:02.513
Okay, I maybe just very boring but I really 
don't wanna be involved with this. Okay?

16:04.388 --> 16:09.263
Look. You can give it back to its owner.
Tell him you found it on the floor.

16:09.430 --> 16:14.055
And remain the law abiding citizen.

16:14.263 --> 16:17.305
Make your daddy proud. It's okay.

16:19.722 --> 16:21.555
Or?

16:22.055 --> 16:25.763
Be an accomplice and come with me.

16:30.847 --> 16:33.222
Fucking rain, eh?

16:39.972 --> 16:41.847
Do you see that table?

16:42.888 --> 16:44.888
Wait for me there.

16:52.388 --> 16:54.472
<i> 20 messages from dad </i>

16:56.680 --> 16:58.513
Along with your father's voice mails

16:58.680 --> 17:04.347
you'll hear from several leading 
oil companies with increasingly rich offers.

17:06.347 --> 17:07.680
Beer.

17:13.430 --> 17:17.137
Don't worry about Lorraine.
She can look after herself.

17:17.305 --> 17:20.387
It's Lorraine now?

17:20.555 --> 17:25.096
Enough with this Cloak and Dagger nonsense.
What's this game all about?

17:26.680 --> 17:31.221
I'm Walter Moreland.
I'm the owner of the salvage business.

17:31.388 --> 17:33.096
And I have a job offer.

17:34.096 --> 17:38.596
I want you to help me break into the vault 
of the most secure location in the world.

17:44.388 --> 17:48.513
Okay, very good.
Do I look like Danny Ocean?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.430
He's a...

17:51.638 --> 17:52.680
I'm an engineer.

17:52.805 --> 17:56.055
And your idea ended the Gulf crisis.

17:56.222 --> 17:58.888
Where others saw futility,
you saw a solution.

17:59.097 --> 18:00.138
It's the same with my problem.

18:00.347 --> 18:04.513
I see an impossible task,
you might see a way to overcome it.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.305
I think you probably need a safe cracker,
someone who actually does this stuff.

18:08.472 --> 18:12.972
Thieves who want to rob a bank today, 
they use a keyboard and a modem.

18:13.138 --> 18:16.055
Great, go and do that.
-I'm not a thief.

18:16.222 --> 18:18.555
Oh really? How do you figure?

18:18.763 --> 18:21.138
Well, the vault, how it works, what it is.

18:21.347 --> 18:23.638
We can't work it out.

18:24.055 --> 18:26.178
For 80 years no one has.

18:26.233 --> 18:29.368
It's been described 
as a miracle of engineering.

18:29.597 --> 18:32.722
But we don't even know
what that means.

18:32.888 --> 18:34.972
I need your mind.

18:35.138 --> 18:37.847
Because I'm not just looking
for a solution to a problem...

18:38.055 --> 18:40.513
I don't know what the problem is.

18:43.138 --> 18:45.347
Why the hell did you think I'd do this?

18:45.513 --> 18:49.597
Aside of making you richer 
than you ever though possible.

Meet the team.

our computer wiz, Klaus.

21:50.740 --> 21:51.551
Hi.
-Hi.

21:51.888 --> 21:56.555
On my right, James,
my colleague and friend of 10 years.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.430

He'll be leading the salvage.

22:10.513 --> 22:12.222
Simon. Acquisitions.

22:12.847 --> 22:16.347
I'm the guy who can get things. 
If you need something just tell me.

22:16.513 --> 22:18.805
Thom, one of the world's brightest minds

22:19.013 --> 22:22.388
and hopefully the key to our success.

22:23.263 --> 22:27.388
He hasn't even mastered shaving 
and he's gonna mastermind infiltration?

22:29.347 --> 22:31.263
Mastermind?
-Yeah.

22:31.430 --> 22:35.888

takes a mastermind.

Klaus, are we in?

22:39.305 --> 22:42.138
Yeah, we got the phone line.
I can listen...

22:42.305 --> 22:44.347
but I need the voicemail code to break in.

22:44.513 --> 22:47.597
The voicemail access code 
lets you break into the system?

22:47.722 --> 22:51.138
The Renaissance art genius of a virus
I created breaks the system.

22:52.013 --> 22:54.513
The code just lets us touch the loop.

22:54.763 --> 22:56.305
Super smart guy, huh?

22:56.472 --> 23:00.555
Until you hear his plan
to get the voicemail code.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.055
Have you got a better plan?

23:02.222 --> 23:04.013
Listen...

23:09.305 --> 23:10.972
He calls numbers
in the bank switch board.

23:11.138 --> 23:15.097
Then keys random 9 digit numbers
hoping to get a match.

23:15.263 --> 23:18.222
It doesn't check one at a time. 
It takes 10 million attempts a day.

23:18.388 --> 23:20.347
How many combinations are there?
-A billion.

23:20.513 --> 23:24.680
What?
Klaus, we don't have time.

23:24.847 --> 23:27.805
Find an employee
who's out of the office.

23:28.013 --> 23:30.913
Call him on their mobile, pretend to be 
one of those automated messages.

23:31.013 --> 23:36.680
telling them they've got urgent voicemail,
they'll key their pass code, we can copy it.

23:37.388 --> 23:39.597
Come on. They won't fall for that.

23:39.722 --> 23:42.597
It's a voicemail code, not bank details. 
Why wouldn't they?

23:42.722 --> 23:46.138
Try it.
Simon, you'll be the message.

23:54.097 --> 23:55.138
<i> Hello? </i>

23:55.305 --> 23:58.430
This is the voicemail service
of the Bank of Spain.

23:58.597 --> 24:03.972
You have a new message.
Please enter your access code after the signal.

24:15.972 --> 24:18.472
The moment of truth.

24:23.597 --> 24:25.263
Well done, Thom.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.805
That's my hack.
-Yes, but he made it work.

24:29.013 --> 24:30.472
So simple.

24:53.430 --> 24:57.722
Unpacking now doesn't mean 
you can't walk later.

24:58.138 --> 25:02.138
You'll just be walking away 
with less creases.

25:06.305 --> 25:09.513
I just don't really know 
what I'm doing here.

25:09.680 --> 25:13.388
Well, the truth is 
you're not off to a bad start.

26:02.097 --> 26:03.805
Another dead end.

26:12.555 --> 26:15.055
Do you know who Sir Francis Drake was?

26:15.222 --> 26:19.805
Yeah, An English sailor from the 1500s,
fought the Spanish armada.

26:20.013 --> 26:22.805
He wasn't navy,
he was a privateer.

26:23.013 --> 26:25.805
Like a pirate?
-It's a fine line.

26:26.013 --> 26:31.680
Drake resented his orders to steal 
Spanish treasures to fond the English Crown.

26:32.097 --> 26:34.972
He stole the treasure
and kept it for himself.

26:35.138 --> 26:37.597
He buried it and no one knows where.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.680
30 years ago I bought this letter

26:41.847 --> 26:45.972
from a backstreet antique dealer in Crete
who didn't know what he had.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.638
It was written by his first mate.

26:47.763 --> 26:54.763
It concerns 3 coins Drake had engraved 
with the coordinates to his fortune.

26:56.680 --> 27:00.513
The coins were kept in this coffer.

27:00.680 --> 27:06.972
30 years I've searched for that. 
A year ago, I found it on the ship wreck.

27:07.138 --> 27:11.055
And that's what locked in the bank.

27:12.138 --> 27:14.763
Drake's motto was
written on the chest.

27:14.972 --> 27:17.055
<i> Sic parvis magna. </i>

27:18.805 --> 27:22.222
'Great things from small things come'

27:22.555 --> 27:24.972
How great are the things that come?

27:25.138 --> 27:27.263
Untold wealth.

27:27.430 --> 27:29.555
But it's not about that.
I have money.

27:29.680 --> 27:34.263
Then why do you care?
-I'm a hunter.

27:34.430 --> 27:37.388
I seek what others have lost.

27:37.555 --> 27:41.138
We can't explain our passions. If we did...

27:41.305 --> 27:43.222
Listen to that.

27:43.388 --> 27:47.347
A million people gathering 
to cheer for men they don't know

27:47.513 --> 27:50.222
to put a ball in a net.

27:50.388 --> 27:55.347
Unnecessarily. Unessential.
But it means everything.

27:56.638 --> 27:58.513
That's passion.

28:02.805 --> 28:07.430
The Bank of Spain is one of the
most impenetrable buildings on the planet.

28:07.597 --> 28:10.888
Every inch of the interior
is covered by cameras and sensors.

28:11.097 --> 28:16.263
Any unauthorized movement brings the rapid 
fire of the 15 guards stationed within.

28:16.430 --> 28:20.263
Across the street is the headquarters
of the Spanish army.

28:20.430 --> 28:23.805
A garrison of 500 on alert,
for any attacks on the city

28:24.013 --> 28:25.472
or any attempts on the bank.

28:25.638 --> 28:28.763
If that wasn't enough,
Gustavo Medina, chief of security.

28:28.972 --> 28:31.347
Former head 
of Spain's anti terrorism task force.

28:31.513 --> 28:33.680
What we call here is 
the real son of a bitch.

28:33.847 --> 28:37.097
If he makes us, the job's off.

28:37.263 --> 28:39.638
How are you getting in?
-From below.

28:39.763 --> 28:42.305
There are more tunnels in Madrid 
than streets on above.

28:42.472 --> 28:44.680
James and Simon are mapping the route.

28:44.805 --> 28:47.472
We're not there yet,
but we're close.

28:47.638 --> 28:50.638
And this supposed to be the vault?

28:50.763 --> 28:56.763
This was a sketch done by an ex-employee,
who was in the vault for a few minutes in 1944.

28:56.972 --> 28:59.597
And this?
-It's some sort of engraving.

28:59.722 --> 29:05.138
They favored aesthetics 
in functional architecture in 19th Century.

29:05.305 --> 29:08.847
Catholic imagery.
Probably a martyr. Very Spanish.

29:09.055 --> 29:13.597
This is apparently bridge, 
and that gives us access to the vault door.

29:13.722 --> 29:18.347
The door requires two actual keys 
and Gustavo Medina's thumb print.

29:18.513 --> 29:23.222
Claudia Valenti, our art expert,
to whom you have met, will take care of it.

29:23.388 --> 29:26.138
Sounds like you've got it covered.

29:27.222 --> 29:28.555
Not even close.

29:28.680 --> 29:32.555
The vault is safety rigged,
but we don't know how.

29:32.680 --> 29:36.106
If we don't shut down the fail safe 
when we enter the vault

29:36.425 --> 29:37.644
we're not coming out.

29:40.138 --> 29:44.680
That's the miracle of engineering 
that you need to identify. Unsolve.

29:45.763 --> 29:48.972
Can I see the actual vault?

29:49.138 --> 29:53.222
I can't go for the cameras yet, 
only watch, not until tomorrow.

29:53.388 --> 29:56.597
We'll also have a better idea 
what that vault looks like then.

29:56.722 --> 29:58.680
We gonna take a magnetometer read.

29:58.805 --> 30:02.097
Wait, you're going in there tomorrow?

30:02.263 --> 30:04.097
Stage 1.

30:08.222 --> 30:10.138
This is the Integrated Cleaning Services.

30:10.347 --> 30:12.555
<i>Good evening. This is the maintenance
department of the Bank of Spain.</i>

30:12.680 --> 30:13.638
Yes?

30:13.763 --> 30:16.847
<i>We're having some problems with the alarms
that are annoying people here.</i>

30:17.055 --> 30:19.138
<i>We must cancel the cleaning tomorrow.</i>

30:19.305 --> 30:21.263
Very well.
How about the day after tomorrow?

30:21.430 --> 30:24.263
We don't know yet.
We'll call you back, okay?

30:24.430 --> 30:25.555
<i>Okay, no problem.</i>

30:27.763 --> 30:29.430
It's ready.

30:29.722 --> 30:32.097
What do you think about it?

30:34.347 --> 30:36.138
It's perfect.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.305
As always.

30:50.263 --> 30:53.763
<i>...passes it on to Villa.
The referee looks at his watch...</i>

30:53.972 --> 30:57.263
<i>...and it's the final whistle!</i>

30:57.430 --> 30:59.680
<i>The spectators are going crazy!</i>

31:04.305 --> 31:08.555
CIBELES SQUARE

31:08.805 --> 31:10.805
We have to postpone
and find a replacement.

31:11.013 --> 31:14.472
We don't have a time and too much of a risk.
- Going in now is the risk.

31:14.638 --> 31:16.347
If you're getting nervous, James 
you need to tell me.

31:16.513 --> 31:19.680
Doing it right 
isn't the question of nerve, Walter.

31:19.847 --> 31:20.763
What's going on?

31:20.972 --> 31:22.972
The security uses INTERPOL's face rec.

31:23.138 --> 31:24.305
James was special forces so...

31:24.472 --> 31:27.972
He is in the database.
The system will bust him.

31:28.138 --> 31:29.263
I'm going in his place.

31:29.430 --> 31:31.638
You don't know how to use the equipment.
-Teach me how to use it.

31:31.763 --> 31:35.555
Teach you how to use 
a magnetometer overnight?

31:35.680 --> 31:39.097
And then Klaus can teach you code 
over breakfast.

31:43.513 --> 31:45.555
I can do it.

31:46.763 --> 31:50.388
Of course you can, Cambridge.
-I know how to use it.

31:51.972 --> 31:54.472
I'm an engineer.

31:56.138 --> 31:58.055
Yesterday you were a student.

31:58.222 --> 32:01.305
Today you're brainstorming 
for a complete stranger

32:01.472 --> 32:04.680
And tomorrow you're a criminal.
Is that right?

32:07.763 --> 32:09.472
Thom will do it.

32:34.638 --> 32:37.680
BANK OF SPAIN
7:57 AM

32:47.222 --> 32:49.305
- How are you?
- Fine.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.388
It's just you two?

32:54.555 --> 32:56.597
Just be glad we're here.

32:56.722 --> 33:00.263
With the World Cup going on,
everyone calls in sick.

33:07.305 --> 33:09.472
The game with Paraguay
wasn't easy yesterday.

33:09.638 --> 33:12.888
With that already being difficult, we
don't stand a chance against Germany.

33:13.097 --> 33:15.138
You'll see.

33:17.430 --> 33:20.722
You know what's funny?
It was the English who invented football...

33:20.888 --> 33:24.097
...but in the end,
it's Germany that always wins.

33:24.513 --> 33:29.055
Says who?
-Gary Lineker.

33:32.138 --> 33:33.972
I prefer our own Torres.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.055
Torres, he says.

33:38.722 --> 33:40.972
Park further on the left.

33:46.138 --> 33:47.680
They're in.

33:53.305 --> 33:55.055
- Good morning.
- Hello.

33:55.430 --> 33:56.847
Claudia Valenti.

34:13.513 --> 34:15.263
Miss Valenti?

34:15.429 --> 34:18.263
I'm Gustavo Medina, head of security.
-Nice to meet you.

34:19.054 --> 34:21.847
Is that your scanner?

34:22.097 --> 34:24.888
No, scanners are for reproductions.

34:25.097 --> 34:27.491
This has an ultraviolet light

34:27.591 --> 34:31.193
that addresses any imperfections 
in the paintings for insurance.

34:31.472 --> 34:33.388
You want to see it?

34:33.554 --> 34:34.847
Gustavo?

34:35.054 --> 34:37.972
That's okay, Miss Valenti.
Munoz will take care of you from here.

34:38.138 --> 34:40.597
Miss Valenti, Mr. Munoz.
-Nice to meet you.

34:40.722 --> 34:42.679
Could you...
-Sure.

34:42.804 --> 34:44.263
Nice to meet you.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.388
This way.

34:47.347 --> 34:49.679
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:01.888 --> 35:03.972
<i> Thom, you're doing a great job. </i>

35:04.138 --> 35:07.013
Now I want you to head 
to the basement level.

35:30.555 --> 35:33.680
Okay, Simon, at the end of the hall,
the door on the left.

35:33.805 --> 35:35.138
Just hold on. Hold on.

35:35.347 --> 35:37.013
Hold on.

35:37.555 --> 35:39.680
Okay, camera off. 90 seconds. Go!

35:57.347 --> 35:59.196
Is it your first time in Madrid?

35:59.571 --> 36:00.418
Yes.

36:02.013 --> 36:05.638
<i> Simon, hurry up. Lorraine 
is almost at the chairman's office. </i>

36:08.555 --> 36:09.722
Here it is.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.597
Done. Did it work?

36:19.680 --> 36:24.513
Yes! The security system is now our bitch.

36:24.763 --> 36:28.555
Okay, so the monitors on the left 
is what Gustavo sees

36:28.680 --> 36:32.013
and right side 
shows what's really happening.

36:32.555 --> 36:33.972
Here is Lorraine.

36:34.138 --> 36:37.013
Please.
-Thank you.

36:37.472 --> 36:41.347
Here it is.
Our most precious Goya.

36:41.513 --> 36:43.393
<i>La Marquesa de Tolosa.</i>

36:43.452 --> 36:44.582
Yes.

36:46.430 --> 36:49.472
If you need something dial 28-71.

36:49.638 --> 36:50.638
Thank you.

37:07.513 --> 37:09.722
Lorraine, can you hear me?
<i> -Yes. </i>

37:10.097 --> 37:11.763
Okay, let's record the loop.

37:14.722 --> 37:18.513
20 seconds... don't breath.
Wait until the camera switches.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.055
Go!

37:23.138 --> 37:25.222
Recording.

37:25.388 --> 37:28.847
<i> Stop, pretend you have seen
something in the picture. </i>

37:30.097 --> 37:31.555
<i> OK... keep scanning. </i>

37:32.138 --> 37:34.013
We're still recording.

37:34.597 --> 37:37.013
Got it. We will put it in the slow mo.

37:39.055 --> 37:40.763
The loop has been launched.

37:40.930 --> 37:43.305
Two and a half minutes... Go!

38:05.722 --> 38:09.555
- It's amazing, no?
- A Goya is always amazing.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.305
Sure, yes, Goya, but I meant ...

38:14.597 --> 38:18.388
You and your sense of humor.
I'll understand it one day.

38:18.555 --> 38:19.472
We'll see about that.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.055
<i> Great, Lorraine.
Let's go for that key... fast. </i>

38:34.805 --> 38:38.847
All right, Thom, 10 meters to your left
there's a door.

38:39.055 --> 38:42.055
Get closer while I prepare the loop.

38:48.763 --> 38:50.847
Scanning first key.

38:51.305 --> 38:52.847
<i> Just wait. Hold on. </i>

38:53.055 --> 38:54.347
Camera is on loop.

38:54.513 --> 38:55.930
Get inside.

38:56.138 --> 38:57.097
Go.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.138
Thom, you're right above the vault pit.

39:17.680 --> 39:18.638
Okay...

39:18.763 --> 39:20.555
<i> It works. </i>

39:20.805 --> 39:21.763
Done.

39:21.930 --> 39:23.513
<i> First key copied. </i>

39:31.597 --> 39:33.305
<i> Lorraine, someone is coming. </i>

39:34.805 --> 39:39.138
I'm not sure what this has to do 
with your current exhibit, Miss Valenti.

39:39.555 --> 39:41.388
I cannot place the artist.

39:41.555 --> 39:46.222
'Eating Breakfast in Salamanca'.
It's my wife.

39:46.388 --> 39:49.847
Mariano Bellido, chairman of the bank.
-Claudia.

39:53.022 --> 39:55.143
Beautiful small talk, Lorraine, 
but if you're not back

39:55.243 --> 39:57.752
in the same position 
in 20 seconds we are screwed.

39:59.722 --> 40:03.430
This is embarrassing,
I was wondering ...

40:03.597 --> 40:06.138
Could you take a picture of me 
scanning it?

40:06.347 --> 40:07.763
Of course.

40:10.638 --> 40:17.138
Now put your left hand an inch left.
And get the chairman off the shot.

40:20.888 --> 40:22.763
Can you take one
from the doorway?

40:22.930 --> 40:26.680
I want to feel the grander 
of your palational office.

40:30.305 --> 40:31.597
Six seconds... 
He's still in shot.

40:31.722 --> 40:33.763
Beautiful.
-<i>Gracias.</i>

40:34.805 --> 40:36.472
Three...

40:36.680 --> 40:37.763
Two...

40:37.930 --> 40:40.930
A little further back?

40:52.680 --> 40:53.680
It's impressive, huh?

40:53.847 --> 40:58.722
And it will stay that way 
if you stop smoking around it.

40:59.638 --> 41:03.138
You can see that from the scan?

41:03.305 --> 41:05.680
And from the air freshener.

41:05.805 --> 41:08.347
And the disabled window lock.

41:08.513 --> 41:11.347
Well...
-Don't worry. I will not mention it.

41:11.513 --> 41:12.763
Thank you.

41:13.888 --> 41:16.388
Good, Lorraine,
go for the other key.

41:19.847 --> 41:21.222
Shit!

41:21.388 --> 41:22.472
<i>Scheisse.</i>
-Fuck.

41:22.638 --> 41:24.513
<i> Thom, you got company. </i>

41:40.055 --> 41:41.722
<i> Break up the magnetometer,
hide it in your clothes </i>

41:41.888 --> 41:45.055
and walk out of the room 
as you've been cleaning it.

41:45.222 --> 41:48.013
We need to abort.
-No, we won't get a second chance.

41:50.013 --> 41:53.222
The first topic of the day:

41:53.388 --> 41:56.680
it was brought
to our attention that...

42:01.597 --> 42:03.555
The other Goya.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.763
Take all the time you need.

42:06.263 --> 42:09.888
Can I help you with anything else?
-No thank you.

42:10.138 --> 42:11.805
Okay then.

42:12.430 --> 42:16.305
<i> OK, Lorraine, 
Gustavo isn't on you yet. Scan fast. </i>

42:18.305 --> 42:21.722
Yesterday, we discussed
July and December operations.

42:21.888 --> 42:26.222
The development process
of assets' index is stable...

42:36.222 --> 42:37.430
ERROR
BLOCKED

42:38.472 --> 42:42.555
So the bank can move forward
with the investment of 211 million...

42:42.680 --> 42:46.055
<i>Scheisse</i>... it's frozen.
- Fix it.

42:47.555 --> 42:51.138
Thom can surge the power but if he...
-The power surge will trigger the alarm.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.680
- It's the fire alarm.
- Quick, come this way.

43:08.430 --> 43:10.055
Attention, everyone.

43:10.555 --> 43:12.097
Where is it, Munoz?

43:12.263 --> 43:13.138
The vault.

43:13.347 --> 43:16.638
What the fuck is that?
50 seconds left.

43:17.138 --> 43:19.138
Close the perimeter.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.597
You go to the vault.

43:22.013 --> 43:24.597
Nobody comes in or goes out
without my permission!

43:24.722 --> 43:26.930
Come on, move it.

43:29.555 --> 43:30.680
Step aside! Step aside!

43:30.847 --> 43:34.638
Second battalion, right flank!

43:40.763 --> 43:42.263
<i> The chairman is on his way. </i>

43:42.430 --> 43:44.013
Two seconds...

43:47.305 --> 43:49.847
Miss Valenti, this way.
Come with me.

43:54.388 --> 43:57.638
The building's on lock own. 
They are moving everybody to the foyer.

43:57.763 --> 43:59.680
Big problem.

43:59.888 --> 44:02.847
The safe is still open
and the key's in my hand.

44:03.722 --> 44:06.597
Miss Valenti? This way. Please
-Thank you.

44:06.722 --> 44:09.472
Well, I'm calling it time to panic.

44:09.638 --> 44:13.388
Simon, I need you to go 
to the controller's office.

44:16.680 --> 44:19.930
That's the problem ... I'm in the foyer.

44:22.430 --> 44:23.430
I'm not.

44:25.430 --> 44:26.680
Where are you, Thom?

44:26.805 --> 44:30.805
Bottom of the stairs.
What do you need me to do?

44:31.388 --> 44:33.763
How's your catching now, Thom?

44:34.013 --> 44:35.680
Absolutely terrible.

44:36.138 --> 44:39.138
Lorraine is gonna throw you a key 
and you'll gonna have to catch it.

44:39.430 --> 44:43.805
<i> There's no room for error. 
If it's on the floor, we're all screwed. </i>

44:45.597 --> 44:47.305
Lorraine, on three.

44:48.305 --> 44:49.430
<i> Two ... </i>

44:49.597 --> 44:51.888
One! Now!

44:54.805 --> 44:56.305
<i> Good job. </i>

44:57.680 --> 44:58.638
<i> Now what? </i>

44:58.763 --> 45:00.805
Okay, Thom, turn left, 15 meters.

45:01.013 --> 45:03.555
<i> You'll find the backstairs.
Go on the third floor. </i>

45:03.680 --> 45:05.222
Third door unlocked.

45:10.138 --> 45:12.888
<i>Scheisse</i>, Thom, there's a guard 
approaching. You've gotta hide.

45:17.388 --> 45:19.930
What are you doing here?

45:20.305 --> 45:25.888
You scared me. I didn't hear the alarm
because I had my ear buds on.

45:26.097 --> 45:27.638
You have to get out of here quickly.

45:28.597 --> 45:29.555
Come on.

45:29.680 --> 45:35.680
Thom, if you have any other hidden talents, 
could you please let us know.

45:35.847 --> 45:38.138
That kid got balls.

45:39.305 --> 45:41.097
What the hell is going on?

45:41.263 --> 45:44.222
<i>Nothing, Gustavo,
the basement is completely empty.</i>

45:44.388 --> 45:46.430
The alarm doesn't go off on its own.

45:46.638 --> 45:48.638
<i>I think there was a power outage.</i>

45:48.763 --> 45:52.347
<i>If it's okay with you,
I want to let people go.</i>

46:00.930 --> 46:03.555
This is the ground floor of the bank.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.472
There's a few hundred feet
of earth and rock and then...

46:06.638 --> 46:09.680
this part soft wavy lines,
out of focus...

46:09.847 --> 46:13.847
This is the vault.
And then an empty chamber below it.

46:14.055 --> 46:19.347
While all of those hard lines, precision.
I just don't understand why this part isn't.

46:19.513 --> 46:22.597
Maybe the scanner shifted?
-No, below it's solid.

46:22.722 --> 46:26.347
The scanner just can't figure out 
what to put in focus.

46:32.055 --> 46:33.722
Water...

46:36.430 --> 46:38.888
It's a tank of water.
The 'soft' part.

46:39.097 --> 46:42.472
The vault sits under
a tank of water.

46:47.013 --> 46:49.263
Shit... he's right.
-Explain.

46:49.430 --> 46:50.722
The water is the trap.

46:50.888 --> 46:53.972
The tank funnels through these pipes here 
flooding the vault.

46:54.138 --> 46:57.138
But that doesn't sound so unrobbing.
You can swim in or scuba?

46:57.347 --> 47:01.430
No no. Because of the empty chamber 
under the vault.

47:01.597 --> 47:03.513
Do you see these 'teeth' on either side?

47:03.680 --> 47:06.680
That's an actuator.
Gears. Like a pinion gears.

47:06.847 --> 47:10.513
When the vault floods
the whole thing sinks down into the chamber.

47:10.680 --> 47:14.472
And if it's in the chamber
no one gets in or out.

47:14.638 --> 47:16.305
What makes it sink. What triggers it?

47:16.472 --> 47:19.888
Lasers maybe? Motion?
-No, too modern.

47:20.097 --> 47:23.680
Whatever it is
it was designed 70 years ago.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.763
It's been in front of you the whole time.

47:48.305 --> 47:51.430
Engraving...
It's not a martyr.

47:51.722 --> 47:54.138
Justice...
-Exactly.

47:54.305 --> 47:56.055
Lady Justice.

47:56.513 --> 47:57.680
So?

47:57.747 --> 48:00.290
When they built this they didn't have 
sensors, motion detectors,

48:00.390 --> 48:02.048
but they did have scales.

48:02.638 --> 48:05.388
If there's a slightest change 
of weight in the vault

48:05.555 --> 48:07.472
the whole thing floods and sinks.

48:07.638 --> 48:12.263
And if you're inside
the vault dispenses its own justice.

48:12.430 --> 48:15.055
It drowns you.

48:15.222 --> 48:19.597
The vault. The miracle of engineering...
-Is one giant weighting scale.

48:20.388 --> 48:21.805
And it's genius.

48:22.013 --> 48:23.555
A giant scales.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.847
So what's the solution?

48:26.055 --> 48:30.722
I don't know. But we know 
what the problem is.

48:32.805 --> 48:34.680
Are you happy now?

48:36.638 --> 48:39.513
"Spanish soldiers
scare the hell out of tourists."

48:39.680 --> 48:41.388
We just followed protocol.

48:41.555 --> 48:44.888
Think before you involve the army
during the World Cup.

48:45.097 --> 48:47.972
And for what?
A simple power outage.

48:48.138 --> 48:50.222
I am not so sure about that.

48:50.388 --> 48:53.888
Haven't you seen what's outside?
The TV screens? The generators?

48:54.097 --> 48:58.347
- I have. We need to take them away.
- I already thought about that.

48:58.513 --> 49:00.222
The semi-final is in a few days.

49:00.388 --> 49:02.680
Enough time to move
that playground elsewhere.

49:02.847 --> 49:05.722
People can watch it
in a pub, as always.

49:05.888 --> 49:09.347
Gustavo, they won't move
the TV screens.

49:09.513 --> 49:12.097
Football is everything.

49:15.138 --> 49:18.430
<i> July 7 / Germany-Spain. Semifinal
FIFA 2010 Football World Cup Final </i>

49:52.013 --> 49:54.847
Fuck, another dead end.

49:55.055 --> 49:57.680
We are only 30 meters away.

50:01.472 --> 50:03.138
Wait...

50:04.097 --> 50:06.347
Do you hear something?

51:00.430 --> 51:02.097
Copper base...

51:02.263 --> 51:04.597
to support the structure.

51:10.347 --> 51:12.013
Kid was right.

51:12.888 --> 51:15.263
It's a scale.

51:17.138 --> 51:20.222
We must be directly under the vault.

51:23.638 --> 51:26.263
The pit must be over there.

51:49.972 --> 51:51.722
Shit...

51:53.513 --> 51:55.555
We're fucked.

52:06.305 --> 52:08.680
Steel plates...

52:09.305 --> 52:12.430
Titanium reinforced concrete...

52:13.347 --> 52:16.555
And a Dyneema shell.
-What does that mean?

52:16.680 --> 52:19.388
To drill through this wall 
to the pit will take 15 days.

52:19.555 --> 52:20.888
We have eight.
Use a bigger drill.

52:21.097 --> 52:27.388
I'm not bargaining with you, Walter.
At 800 psi this wall will take 15 days.

52:27.555 --> 52:31.222
Drill harder and we'll trigger the alarm.

52:47.347 --> 52:48.822
That's it? We're done?

52:49.061 --> 52:51.252
We're not gonna try 
and figure out another way?

52:52.013 --> 52:54.097
Walter will pay you for your time.

52:54.847 --> 52:58.680
Sorry you wasted
five days of your life.

53:53.763 --> 53:57.138
Walter, If I'm not gonna be rich 
I could at least watch the games.

53:57.347 --> 53:59.430
Simon, come here.

54:00.388 --> 54:03.513
We can't break in from below, 
but we can break in from above.

54:03.680 --> 54:05.847
Walter, we spent weeks 
mapping the route from above.

54:06.055 --> 54:09.138
We abandoned it because there's too much 
exposure from the CCTV cameras.

54:09.305 --> 54:12.430
Except when Spain plays 
its world cup games.

54:12.597 --> 54:15.055
When the crowd gathers
in the Cibeles Square

54:15.222 --> 54:19.097
every single camera will be pointing 
away from the building towards the crowd.

54:19.263 --> 54:21.388
It will be lie that for the final.

54:21.555 --> 54:25.430
Which give us 105 minutes
to get the job done.

54:25.597 --> 54:27.555
This is your route, James.

54:27.680 --> 54:30.347
From the Zurich building, 
through the dome, through the vents.

54:30.513 --> 54:32.472
Is it still viable?

54:32.638 --> 54:35.763
If the cameras are pointing at the crowd, 
and not the bank...

54:35.972 --> 54:39.430
then yeah, it is viable.

54:40.388 --> 54:44.888
So everything depends on this match?

54:57.388 --> 54:58.680
<i>...corner kick!</i>

54:59.888 --> 55:03.263
I just wanted to remind you 
that we've still got a problem.

55:03.430 --> 55:05.305
My problem.

55:05.472 --> 55:06.972
The scale.

55:07.138 --> 55:10.722
I'm still no closer to finding a solution
and the finals are four days away.

55:10.888 --> 55:13.055
Half the time I was meant to have.

55:13.222 --> 55:16.100
Well, I have every faith 
that Spain will get there.

55:16.525 --> 55:19.000
And I have every faith in you.

55:19.805 --> 55:23.222
Come on, come on... goal!

55:27.638 --> 55:30.097
It's all on you now, Thom.

55:32.847 --> 55:34.972
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I doubted you.

55:35.138 --> 55:39.680
<i>Goal for Spain,
goal for Puyol!</i>

55:39.847 --> 55:43.763
<i> Spain 1, Germany 0! </i>

56:02.680 --> 56:06.513
- Want another coffee?
- Show me number 4.

56:07.138 --> 56:09.097
With milk?

56:09.472 --> 56:10.513
This is disgusting.

56:10.972 --> 56:15.430
Any intention of emptying these bins?

56:15.597 --> 56:18.138
We weren't allowed in for two days.

56:18.305 --> 56:20.805
And now we are getting complaints.

56:21.013 --> 56:24.138
The day before yesterday,
there were two cleaners here.

56:24.305 --> 56:29.638
Weren't ours. You canceled on us.
And now you're saying...

56:50.138 --> 56:53.430
Drink that and you won't sleep.

56:53.597 --> 56:56.680
I'm drinking that so I won't sleep.

56:56.888 --> 57:00.305
You've been awake for 43 hours.

57:02.055 --> 57:05.763
You won't figure it out 
if you break down with exhaustion.

57:10.972 --> 57:13.263
Great work.

57:31.138 --> 57:36.138
He'll be fine. I put my faith in him.
-You put fear in him.

57:36.347 --> 57:38.888
Think what it will do to him if he fails.

57:39.097 --> 57:42.513
He'll take a job at GranCo Oil.
-Not if he does have a idea.

57:42.680 --> 57:45.055
What if he does and it fails?

57:45.222 --> 57:47.430
He won't be anywhere near it.

57:47.597 --> 57:50.680
But we will. And that's the risk 
we agreed to take.

57:50.805 --> 57:53.347
But you're asking him 
to put our lives in his hands.

57:53.680 --> 57:57.138
Every voyage, every salvage, every dive.

57:57.305 --> 58:00.722
We all ask the crew
to take each others lives in their hands.

58:02.138 --> 58:04.680
He's not in your crew.

58:04.847 --> 58:06.597
He's a college kid.

58:07.597 --> 58:11.055
And you're worried about him 
because he's a college kid?

58:11.555 --> 58:13.805
Or is it something else?

58:20.680 --> 58:23.763
- Here's your "power outage."
- Who are they?

58:23.972 --> 58:26.388
Neither the police, nor the Civil Guard
have any files on them...

58:26.555 --> 58:29.388
...but they are
definitely not cleaners.

58:29.555 --> 58:35.055
They entered with fake IDs.

58:35.638 --> 58:37.138
Son of the bitch!

58:37.347 --> 58:42.097
I thought we were invulnerable
with our latest gadgets.

58:42.263 --> 58:46.222
We are.
And now we know who they are.

58:46.388 --> 58:47.599
What do they want? Gold?

58:47.699 --> 58:51.618
It would be impossible 
because of the weight. Too heavy.

58:53.388 --> 58:55.680
- What's in those shipwreck crates?
- No idea.

58:55.847 --> 59:00.305
They are sealed
until the Ministry investigates them.

59:02.097 --> 59:05.472
You're not allowed to
smoke in here and you know it.

59:10.555 --> 59:13.638
Thom, do you have a criminal record?

59:14.597 --> 59:15.555
OK.

59:18.138 --> 59:21.305
He's clean. Simon?
-I've never even had a parking ticket.

59:21.472 --> 59:25.430
If it wasn't for my birth certificate,
there would be no proof that I even exist.

59:25.597 --> 59:27.597
And the image search 
won't turn anything up.

59:27.722 --> 59:28.680
What's going on?

59:28.805 --> 59:31.972
You fucked up when you surged the power 
that's what going on.

59:32.138 --> 59:33.472
Walter's right.

59:33.638 --> 59:35.722
We haven't been made.
-We haven't been made?

59:35.888 --> 59:38.305
Gustavo Medina knows someone's 
after the vault.

59:38.513 --> 59:39.555
Places a trap.

59:39.680 --> 59:41.805
We can monitor the trap.
-Walter's right.

59:42.013 --> 59:45.513
Walter's right? Are you even capable 
of having a thought of your own?

59:45.680 --> 59:49.138
Yes, when I agreed to do this job.
Just like you.

59:49.305 --> 59:53.138
Since then all I heard from you 
are reasons to run.

59:53.305 --> 59:55.347
Why did you come aboard?

59:56.472 --> 59:57.805
Loyalty.

59:58.138 --> 01:00:00.680
Yeah? To whom?

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.847
Stop!

01:00:03.055 --> 01:00:05.034
James, we go on with the plan.

01:00:05.074 --> 01:00:07.705
They know we want to get in 
but not how we'll do it.

01:00:07.763 --> 01:00:11.805
Thom, you figure out 
how to crack that scale.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:18.597
They are quite blurry,
we can't see much.

01:00:19.055 --> 01:00:20.263
Do you have any better photos?

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:23.138
Yes, but I prefer
we get it done with these.

01:00:26.138 --> 01:00:28.722
The ship left America at the time...

01:00:28.888 --> 01:00:31.472
...with a cargo of gold
and silver, and then it sank.

01:00:31.638 --> 01:00:34.388
Total value of the cargo?

01:00:34.555 --> 01:00:38.055
15 to 20 million. Maybe more.

01:00:38.638 --> 01:00:40.430
Wait a moment...

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:46.305
If this is what it seems like,
we are not talking about 20 million.

01:00:46.472 --> 01:00:48.305
It's worth more than that.

01:00:48.472 --> 01:00:49.972
Much more.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.055
<i> Walter, how is the Eiffel Tower? </i>

01:01:05.263 --> 01:01:07.638
I'm a little south of Paris.

01:01:07.972 --> 01:01:10.888
Really? How far south?

01:01:11.097 --> 01:01:13.055
<i> Eating a paella. </i>

01:01:13.222 --> 01:01:15.638
<i> And I need your help. </i>

01:01:15.888 --> 01:01:17.847
Walter, you know where we stand.

01:01:18.055 --> 01:01:21.097
<i> The government hands are tied and you know it. </i>

01:01:21.263 --> 01:01:23.680
50%, Margaret.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.763
All I need you to do is tell a lie.

01:01:26.138 --> 01:01:29.013
<i> I know you can do that. </i>

BANK OF SPAIN

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:35.305
So the Ministry doesn't know
the content of the crates. Typical.

01:01:35.472 --> 01:01:40.555
But those two men who entered 
with fake IDs know. And they want to steal it.

01:01:40.722 --> 01:01:41.763
Next Sunday.

01:01:41.972 --> 01:01:44.472
- And ruin the final for me?
- I'm serious.

01:01:44.638 --> 01:01:47.347
It is not a coincidence
that they came 3 days ago.

01:01:47.513 --> 01:01:49.972
The final provides them 
with the perfect diversion opportunity.

01:01:50.138 --> 01:01:54.138
They will be coming when everyone's
looking the other way, including you.

01:01:54.347 --> 01:01:57.763
We need to double up the security.
And close Cibeles, Prado and Alcala.

01:01:57.972 --> 01:02:01.138
If we do that, we will have 
a huge problem maintaining the order.

01:02:01.305 --> 01:02:03.597
That's your problem,
mine is the security of my bank.

01:02:03.722 --> 01:02:08.680
- Your bank? Don't make me laugh.
- Gentlemen, calm down.

01:02:08.847 --> 01:02:10.513
Tell me.

01:02:13.388 --> 01:02:17.138
We sent the photos
to Interpol and Europol.

01:02:17.305 --> 01:02:22.055
We just received a message from
the British intelligence service MI6...

01:02:22.222 --> 01:02:24.972
...those two men were arrested yesterday 
at Heathrow Airport.

01:02:25.138 --> 01:02:28.888
One of them had a USB stick
with a blueprints of our bank.

01:02:29.097 --> 01:02:31.680
Also banks in Zurich,
London and Hamburg.

01:02:31.805 --> 01:02:34.138
- The problem is solved.
- This does not change anything.

01:02:34.305 --> 01:02:39.263
Someone tried to get in here
and this arrest does not change anything.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:43.055
Gustavo, you were right.
But now it's over. End of the story.

01:02:43.222 --> 01:02:47.597
Sir, with all due respect,
you are missing the point.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:50.972
Fill the bank with soldiers
and increase security.

01:02:51.138 --> 01:02:53.472
You're in charge now 
and I won't interfere.

01:02:53.638 --> 01:02:57.305
But people will watch
the final in the square. Period.

01:03:16.597 --> 01:03:18.847
I'm kinda busy here, Lorraine.

01:03:22.138 --> 01:03:23.638
What do you want?

01:03:24.013 --> 01:03:25.722
A drink.

01:03:26.847 --> 01:03:32.513
Wash your face and put this on.
I'm not asking.

01:03:55.597 --> 01:04:00.888
So you said he was
like a father to you?

01:04:01.097 --> 01:04:05.263
My real father worked for him.
He died when I was eight.

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:10.680
Walter told my mom
if I ever needed anything he'll be there.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:13.097
She died when I was 12.

01:04:15.513 --> 01:04:17.347
I'm sorry.

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:22.555
It wasn't easy. I was angry all the time.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.222
None of the foster homes could deal with me 
for more than a few weeks.

01:04:26.388 --> 01:04:30.388
So I wound up on the streets. Three years.

01:04:30.555 --> 01:04:34.138
And Walter appeared and tracked me down.

01:04:34.472 --> 01:04:36.222
He kept his promise.

01:04:38.055 --> 01:04:40.013
Lorraine...

01:04:41.513 --> 01:04:45.263
What if I'm steering you off the cliff?

01:04:48.805 --> 01:04:53.597
You're too smart and you overthink.

01:04:53.805 --> 01:04:58.430
I looked at your ideas there.
I don't understand them at all.

01:04:58.597 --> 01:05:01.513
But do you know what I do understand?

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.138
Using an automated message 
to get the phone pass code.

01:05:05.305 --> 01:05:07.513
Yeah, that simple isn't always best.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.138
More often than not.

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:10.680
Look...

01:05:10.847 --> 01:05:15.097
You can drink a cold beer
on a hot day.

01:05:15.263 --> 01:05:20.347
Or spend eternity watching this guy 
spin bottles like an idiot.

01:05:20.612 --> 01:05:23.095
Then get a glass of smoky red bullshit.

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:29.004
You can be a victim of fashion.

01:05:29.722 --> 01:05:37.680
Or you can look sexy as hell
in a plain gray shirt.

01:05:40.305 --> 01:05:42.472
How much money do you have?

01:05:47.347 --> 01:05:48.597
Can I?

01:05:59.138 --> 01:06:01.013
Right?

01:06:01.555 --> 01:06:03.555
Now watch this.

01:06:23.222 --> 01:06:24.847
The weight didn't register.

01:06:25.055 --> 01:06:27.722
You froze it?
-The metal is always 'frozen', James.

01:06:27.888 --> 01:06:32.597
But yes. I further slowed
its atomic activity.

01:06:33.472 --> 01:06:35.847
I've tricked the scale.

01:06:40.638 --> 01:06:42.638
Will this all work in the vault?
-Same principle.

01:06:42.763 --> 01:06:45.222
Bigger scale need more nitrogen. But yeah.

01:06:45.388 --> 01:06:49.055
We'll just need someone in the chamber below
to freeze the scale before we enter.

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:51.263
It's genius, Thom.

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:54.347
No... it's simple.

01:07:00.138 --> 01:07:01.888
Thom...

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:04.222
What do we need?

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:08.138
Thermal lances, a fire suit 
and 500 liters of liquid nitrogen.

01:07:08.305 --> 01:07:10.513
500?

01:07:11.638 --> 01:07:14.513
OK, I'll figure it out.
-Well, this is all well and good

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.312
but as long as someone's in the chamber 
spraying liquid nitrogen

01:07:17.374 --> 01:07:19.851
then we're one short in the bank.

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:23.555
I'll go in the bank.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.472
No we need you up here running the show.

01:07:28.722 --> 01:07:34.222
I've asked a lot of you, 
but would you be willing to go to the chamber?

01:07:34.805 --> 01:07:36.555
No...
- It's the least amount of exposure.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.680
Walter, he said 'no'.
- I'm not going in the chamber.

01:07:40.805 --> 01:07:42.805
Simon is.

01:07:44.222 --> 01:07:46.222
I'm going in the bank.

01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:49.680
There's no way I'm taking you in there.
-I'm not asking.

01:07:49.805 --> 01:07:53.138
Who put you in charge?
-Walter did.

01:07:53.347 --> 01:07:56.555
When you brought me here,
this became my responsibility.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:01.763
And I won't be responsible for their lives 
without putting mine alongside them.

01:08:07.013 --> 01:08:10.805
Let me make this clear 
so I'm absolutely sure you understand it.

01:08:11.013 --> 01:08:13.138
We can't escape 
through the tunnels anymore.

01:08:13.347 --> 01:08:15.805
So we'll go in and out through the roof.

01:08:16.013 --> 01:08:20.680
And everything before the match finishes.
There's no plan 'B'.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:26.555
If we get caught, we're going down 
for a very long time.

01:08:27.221 --> 01:08:30.971
Are you sure you are prepared for that?

01:08:31.386 --> 01:08:33.136
Are you?

01:09:23.805 --> 01:09:25.136
Here they are.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.971
Take into account that these
are very rare pieces.

01:09:28.136 --> 01:09:29.346
How much?

01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:31.596
20,000 for the entire set.

01:09:31.721 --> 01:09:34.721
I want to have them engraved.

01:09:59.887 --> 01:10:02.202
Are you sure it's a good idea 
to be doing shots

01:10:02.302 --> 01:10:05.031
the night before committing 
the crime of the century?

01:10:06.347 --> 01:10:09.847
No regrets... It's a tradition.

01:10:10.555 --> 01:10:12.680
The night before a dangerous voyage

01:10:12.847 --> 01:10:18.305
the sailors would drink rum 
and voice one thing they regretted.

01:10:20.347 --> 01:10:21.722
Okay, I regret...

01:10:22.138 --> 01:10:25.888
that one night in Thailand
when I woke up next to that ladyboy.

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:28.972
What? It's not funny.

01:10:29.138 --> 01:10:30.972
OK, I go.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.138
I regret...

01:10:36.888 --> 01:10:43.138
I won't be able to watch Spain win
the World Cup with my father.

01:10:44.638 --> 01:10:47.222
He had dreamt of it his whole life.

01:10:47.388 --> 01:10:50.680
But if he can't be here to watch it

01:10:51.638 --> 01:10:54.680
I'll listen to it on his old radio.

01:10:55.138 --> 01:10:58.430
Maybe that way he can hear it

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.430
with me.

01:11:04.805 --> 01:11:08.388
Thom? You don't regret
joining us on the salvage?

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:10.722
No, that's one thing I don't regret.

01:11:11.138 --> 01:11:13.638
Do you mind me asking why you did accept?

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.472
Passion.

01:11:19.388 --> 01:11:21.763
And because it was impossible.

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:25.972
Lorraine?

01:11:28.097 --> 01:11:29.680
How about you, James?

01:11:32.597 --> 01:11:37.388
This is our 14th 'salvage',
as you like to call it.

01:11:37.555 --> 01:11:39.888
But it's a big one.

01:11:40.888 --> 01:11:42.805
No regrets.

01:11:46.263 --> 01:11:47.638
No regrets.

We're in position.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.722

<i> One, checked.

<i> Three, checked.
-Four, is not quite yet. </i>

01:13:39.305 --> 01:13:41.222
Now I'm checked.

01:14:00.263 --> 01:14:02.680
The Captain also checked.
First positions.

You remember what I said
about thinking?

01:15:12.013 --> 01:15:16.347
Listen, Gustavo, I have two teams
on stand by.

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:19.305
<i>And the bank is sealed off airtight.</i>

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:45.097
OK, foyer is clear.

All right, guys, we are tracking you 
on the schematic.

01:17:35.013 --> 01:17:36.638
All right, this is gonna start 
getting tricky.

01:17:46.055 --> 01:17:47.763
15 meters, straight.

100 meters? Are you kidding me?

<i>The foyer is secure.

in making them any more nervous.

Don't fuck around, Munoz, focus!

01:18:31.972 --> 01:18:32.972
Fucking hell!

01:18:33.138 --> 01:18:35.472
They are 2 minutes behind,
why is that happening?

01:18:35.638 --> 01:18:37.722

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.222
<i>Spain 0, Netherlands 0!</i>

01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:00.972
OK guys, it's half time.
60 minutes to get out.

01:19:01.138 --> 01:19:03.888
<i> We're 10 minutes late. </i>

01:19:13.138 --> 01:19:15.972
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>
- Have we been robbed yet?

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.138
No, Mr. Director.

01:19:18.347 --> 01:19:20.388
<i>Then they have to hurry,
the second half starts soon.</i>

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:24.305
0-0...
but the Dutch are prevailing now.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.222
Check all the cameras and sensors again.

01:19:37.347 --> 01:19:39.805
Did he mention the score?

01:19:46.138 --> 01:19:48.638
Clear to proceed, in three.

01:20:15.763 --> 01:20:16.763
<i> We see you again ... </i>

01:20:17.138 --> 01:20:21.430
It's 46 minutes until full time. Let's go.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:45.347
<i>And the second half begins!</i>

01:20:58.305 --> 01:21:00.263
Come on, Cambridge.

01:21:20.388 --> 01:21:21.888
Thom!

01:21:22.555 --> 01:21:25.722
Thom? Look at me.

01:21:29.597 --> 01:21:31.555
You're good.

01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:36.138
That's right.

01:21:54.722 --> 01:21:57.513
James, don't move!
The back is slipping!

01:22:02.388 --> 01:22:03.972
Stop!

01:22:10.513 --> 01:22:12.638
Thom, how's that catching arm?

01:22:12.805 --> 01:22:14.888
Still not quite good.

01:22:38.347 --> 01:22:43.472
Thank you for saving my life, Thom.

01:22:45.097 --> 01:22:47.680
I will buy you flowers.

01:22:47.805 --> 01:22:50.347
Klaus, the codes?

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.680
<i> OK, the codes change
every 33 minutes. </i>

01:22:52.805 --> 01:22:55.680
We get 6 minutes
before I can try grabbing the next one.

01:22:55.847 --> 01:22:58.763
But you can grab them?
-That would be another question.

01:22:58.972 --> 01:23:01.722
You can do it. You can do it...

01:23:04.972 --> 01:23:06.680
Six.
-Six...

01:23:07.597 --> 01:23:09.305
Three.
-Three...

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.097
Seven.
-Seven...

01:23:17.513 --> 01:23:19.138
One... just one more ...
how's my time?

01:23:19.347 --> 01:23:21.430
15 seconds.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.972
10...

01:23:26.138 --> 01:23:29.888
Klaus, if we don't get this 
we'll have to wait 31 minutes.

01:23:30.097 --> 01:23:31.472
Come on baby...

01:23:33.013 --> 01:23:35.138
Four! It's four. Jesus!

01:23:37.972 --> 01:23:40.680
<i> Walkaway camera is looped. </i>

01:23:48.722 --> 01:23:52.472
<i> All right. Motion detectors off. Go! </i>

01:24:12.972 --> 01:24:14.263
VERIFICATION
CORRECT

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.138
There they are.

01:25:21.138 --> 01:25:24.138
<i> Simon, you are clear to go. </i>

01:26:02.305 --> 01:26:06.305
21 minutes left.
It's talking far too much time.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:12.972
Simon, how many liters did you use?
<i> -80 percent. </i>

01:26:13.138 --> 01:26:14.472
20 left.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.305
Shouldn't it have worked by now?

01:26:24.033 --> 01:26:25.124
Yeah.

01:26:27.513 --> 01:26:29.097
But it hasn't.

01:26:31.613 --> 01:26:33.031
Fuck!

01:26:36.472 --> 01:26:38.263
Simon, how much left?

01:26:44.597 --> 01:26:47.680
None. That's all of it.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.680
Well done.

01:27:13.847 --> 01:27:15.138
Wait!

01:27:21.847 --> 01:27:24.555
You wanna see what I see.

01:27:27.347 --> 01:27:28.847
It's working.

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:34.927
All right.

01:27:35.263 --> 01:27:38.763
Hang on. I go first.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.097
If I'm wrong, it's on me.

01:27:56.222 --> 01:27:58.513
The scale hasn't moved. Move on.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.388
<i> Move fast. It will only last a few
minutes. Get to work! </i>

01:28:15.472 --> 01:28:19.222
The sensors in the foyer
are triggered.

01:28:21.347 --> 01:28:23.430
Patrols 6 and 8 to the foyer.

01:28:23.638 --> 01:28:25.680
<i>Movement has been detected.</i>

01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:36.263
Guys, this thing's melting fast.

01:28:46.763 --> 01:28:49.055
We found the intruder.

01:28:49.222 --> 01:28:50.680
<i>A pigeon.</i>

01:28:50.847 --> 01:28:52.347
How the hell did it get in?

01:28:54.347 --> 01:28:56.347
There is an opening in the dome.

01:28:56.513 --> 01:28:59.097
Show me the dome cameras.

01:29:05.972 --> 01:29:08.680
<i>Sic parvis magna..</i>

01:29:09.013 --> 01:29:10.805
I found it.

01:29:11.013 --> 01:29:12.680
And the coins?

01:29:21.138 --> 01:29:24.138
Walter, you need to see this.

01:29:25.138 --> 01:29:26.847
Fuck.

01:29:27.138 --> 01:29:28.847
No, there is no opening.

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.722
<i>But I can see it.</i>

01:29:30.888 --> 01:29:34.597
- They hacked into our cameras.
- Check all the cameras!

01:29:35.013 --> 01:29:36.680
What do you mean we have been made?

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:40.388
<i> They found a whole in the dome. 
They know you're in the building. </i>

01:29:40.555 --> 01:29:43.097
<i> The guards have been mobilized.
-What do we do? </i>

01:29:46.263 --> 01:29:48.597
You need to get out of the vault 
and surrender to the guards.

01:29:48.722 --> 01:29:52.263
No, we can't. There's got to be 
another solution.

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:53.638
You have to surrender.

01:29:53.763 --> 01:29:56.888
<i> And do it clearly,
or the guards will shoot you. </i>

01:29:59.388 --> 01:30:01.680
This is not gonna hold!
We have to get out now!

01:30:01.847 --> 01:30:03.888
Wait.
-What?

01:30:05.222 --> 01:30:06.847
Give me the coins.

01:30:07.888 --> 01:30:11.347
<i> What the hell are you doing, James?
We've lost, it's over. </i>

01:30:12.722 --> 01:30:14.138
Not for me it's not.

01:30:16.138 --> 01:30:19.472
Give me the coins, Lorraine. 
Give them to me.

01:30:20.138 --> 01:30:23.638
What the hell does that mean?
<i> -You were never gonna get the coins. </i>

01:30:23.763 --> 01:30:25.805
They've ordered me to bring them
to the British Embassy.

01:30:26.013 --> 01:30:27.597
<i> 'They'? Who? </i>

01:30:28.138 --> 01:30:30.097
You know who.

01:30:31.055 --> 01:30:34.055
<i> You should've seen it coming.
</i> -I thought you had retired.

01:30:34.222 --> 01:30:35.972
We never retire, Walter.

01:30:38.638 --> 01:30:41.097
Give him the coins, Lorraine!

01:30:42.138 --> 01:30:44.305
Give him the coins, Lorraine!

01:30:51.472 --> 01:30:53.138
Oh shit...

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:06.430
The alarm is going off.

01:31:06.597 --> 01:31:08.888
- Those bastards are inside.
- They are in the vault.

01:31:09.097 --> 01:31:12.097
Check the system! Code 1!

01:31:17.597 --> 01:31:18.972
Move! Move!

01:31:46.888 --> 01:31:48.638
Here we go.

01:32:04.847 --> 01:32:06.763
<i>Scheisse.</i>

01:32:31.013 --> 01:32:32.847
What are you doing?

01:32:33.555 --> 01:32:37.722
There are a handful people in the world 
that can make that swim.

01:32:38.138 --> 01:32:40.680
And you're not two of them.

01:32:45.055 --> 01:32:46.430
I'm sorry, Lorraine.

01:32:49.097 --> 01:32:50.597
Really. I am.

01:32:53.138 --> 01:32:54.680
Fuck off.

01:33:15.513 --> 01:33:18.472
It's over. I'm calling the bank.
They can stop it.

01:33:18.638 --> 01:33:19.972
<i> There's no point! </i>

01:33:20.138 --> 01:33:21.597
This thing's autonomous.

01:33:21.722 --> 01:33:25.305
It won't stop until the vault's filled.

01:34:00.555 --> 01:34:04.138
Thom, listen to me, 
there's nothing we can do from here.

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:06.305
Do you think we don't know that?

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.972
<i> Thom, Lorraine, keep calm!
We'll get you out of there! </i>

01:34:21.138 --> 01:34:23.722
You have around 10 minutes
before your submerged. 10 minutes.

01:34:24.555 --> 01:34:26.138
Okay.
-We have to get out!

01:34:26.347 --> 01:34:29.972
You studied the 3D model. You know it. 
There has to be a way, a route.

01:34:30.138 --> 01:34:35.847
Okay! I'm thinking! Everybody shut up! 
Shut up! I'm trying to think!

01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:42.305
OK, Thom, let's keep it simple.

01:34:42.597 --> 01:34:44.263
Basic laws of physics:

01:34:44.472 --> 01:34:46.138
The water will stop coming when
the vault is full...

01:34:46.305 --> 01:34:49.055
it has to, otherwise the pressure 
will burst the vault.

01:34:49.222 --> 01:34:51.680
Great. But that won't save us.

01:34:54.097 --> 01:34:57.305
There are no sensors in here
to take the water level...

01:34:57.472 --> 01:35:01.347
so how does it know when to shut off?

01:35:03.555 --> 01:35:05.305
The weight!

01:35:05.597 --> 01:35:08.138
The weight!

01:35:09.222 --> 01:35:11.972
<i> Simon! Are you still there, man? </i>

01:35:12.138 --> 01:35:13.055
Yeah, sure.

01:35:13.222 --> 01:35:15.430
Okay, apply as much weight 
as you can onto the scale.

01:35:16.513 --> 01:35:18.430
<i> Come on, please! </i>

01:35:18.597 --> 01:35:19.847
<i> Come on! </i>

01:35:21.013 --> 01:35:22.013
<i>Rapido!</i>

01:35:22.388 --> 01:35:24.805
<i> Rapido! Rapido! </i>

01:35:26.055 --> 01:35:29.597
<i> We have to trick the scale, we have 
to trick it into thinking the vault's full! </i>

01:35:29.763 --> 01:35:31.847
It's all about the scale, it has to be.

01:35:57.263 --> 01:35:59.263
What if you're wrong?

01:36:01.305 --> 01:36:03.805
The vault is filling up,
but we still don't see anything.

01:36:04.013 --> 01:36:05.680
- How is it going?
- <i>I'm doing what I can.</i>

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.472
It's not enough! Figure it out!

01:36:21.472 --> 01:36:23.888
Simon, the water is still rising!

01:36:32.347 --> 01:36:33.638
It's done!

01:36:34.222 --> 01:36:35.763
Gustavo!

01:36:37.597 --> 01:36:39.097
<i>Scheisse!</i>

01:36:39.263 --> 01:36:41.763
I don't have control anymore. 
Gustavo does.

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:40.722
It is all I have, guys. I'm sorry.

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.722
Lorraine?

01:37:52.097 --> 01:37:53.847
Thom?

01:37:59.972 --> 01:38:02.013
What's happening?

01:38:02.638 --> 01:38:05.347
Walter, you don't think...

01:38:30.388 --> 01:38:32.638
Come on, Dad, you can do it.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.430
<i>We go to overtime.
Spain 0, Netherlands 0.</i>

01:39:10.555 --> 01:39:13.638
Gustavo, the vault is being emptied.

01:39:30.347 --> 01:39:34.055
<i>Watch out, the vault will be unlocked
automatically when it's emptied.</i>

01:39:41.222 --> 01:39:42.347
Move!

01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:01.097
- They're gone.
- What do you mean "gone?"

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.888
No idea, sir.
There is no body. Nothing.

01:40:11.763 --> 01:40:14.888
They must be somewhere...

01:40:16.347 --> 01:40:18.305
No?

01:40:32.055 --> 01:40:33.805
Walter?

01:40:34.013 --> 01:40:35.680
Walter?

01:40:36.138 --> 01:40:38.388
Thom? Lorraine? Can you hear me?

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:04.138
Those bastards...

01:41:10.013 --> 01:41:13.305
<i> Thom? Lorraine? Can you hear me?
</i> -Yes, we hear you!

01:41:13.472 --> 01:41:15.805
<i> It worked!
Simon did it! </i>

01:41:16.013 --> 01:41:18.972
All units, search all floors.

01:41:19.138 --> 01:41:22.097
Also the service areas.
All exits are blocked.

01:41:26.638 --> 01:41:29.680
<i> OK, guys, we'll get you out of there. </i>

01:41:30.138 --> 01:41:32.972
Walter, there's no way to get out.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.763
What do we do?

01:41:34.972 --> 01:41:37.305
I don't know. Just stay in the room. 
There are no cameras there.

01:41:37.472 --> 01:41:39.597
They'll find them in five minutes. 
Klaus, get them out of there.

01:41:39.722 --> 01:41:40.680
To where?

01:41:40.888 --> 01:41:43.680
<i> The whole building is crawling with guards.
There is no way out. </i>

01:41:43.805 --> 01:41:45.722
They can break a fucking window.

01:41:45.888 --> 01:41:48.138
<i> The windows are bulletproof.
They need keys to open. </i>

01:41:48.347 --> 01:41:49.263
Fuck!

01:41:50.722 --> 01:41:52.430
Third floor.

01:41:53.347 --> 01:41:54.680
Run!

01:41:57.555 --> 01:42:00.138
Stop! Freeze!

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:03.597
<i>They are running away to the 2nd floor!</i>

01:42:05.055 --> 01:42:08.430
- There they are! In the west wing!
- <i>All exits are blocked. </i>

01:42:08.597 --> 01:42:10.888
Freeze!

01:42:12.097 --> 01:42:15.138
<i>They're heading to the 3rd floor! </i>

01:42:18.388 --> 01:42:22.097
- They're going to the chairman's office.
- They have no way to go.

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.138
What are they doing?
-I don't know.

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.138
<i>Block the hallway.</i>

01:42:33.763 --> 01:42:35.347
They must not escape.

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.597
Go in.

01:42:56.972 --> 01:43:02.680
<i>...Ramos passes...
only 10 minutes to go...</i>

01:43:07.097 --> 01:43:09.972
Have you gone mad?
There are thousands of people there!

01:43:10.138 --> 01:43:12.638
Gustavo, calm down.

01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:17.638
To all units: they escaped.

01:43:17.763 --> 01:43:19.763
They are running in the crowd,
towards the TV screen.

01:43:31.013 --> 01:43:31.972
There! There they are!

01:43:33.472 --> 01:43:35.555
There! There!

01:44:07.513 --> 01:44:09.222
I'm sorry.

01:44:09.513 --> 01:44:10.847
No regrets.

01:44:14.888 --> 01:44:19.097
<i> ... go to Iniesta! </i>

01:44:20.263 --> 01:44:21.555
<i> Iniesta! </i>

01:44:45.722 --> 01:44:47.388
Let's go!

01:44:50.847 --> 01:44:53.305
Goal!

01:44:59.513 --> 01:45:03.263
<i>Iniesta scores!
Spain 1, Netherlands 0! </i>

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.013
THE NEXT DAY

01:45:08.263 --> 01:45:11.763
PALACE HOTEL
MADRID

01:45:14.055 --> 01:45:16.847
You wanna buy me that drink now, Margaret?

01:45:17.015 --> 01:45:17.907
<i>James:
Ok. See you later.</i>

01:45:18.263 --> 01:45:21.305
I'm just still not celebrating.

01:45:22.263 --> 01:45:23.513
Spain are.

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:26.430
Yes, we are as well.

01:45:29.263 --> 01:45:33.097
You really believe in all that
for 'Queen & country' bullshit?

01:45:34.055 --> 01:45:36.763
And I believe in doing my job.

01:45:36.972 --> 01:45:38.555
You used me...

01:45:38.888 --> 01:45:41.138
from the beginning.

01:45:41.347 --> 01:45:45.097
We knew you were going do it. 
We could not.

01:45:46.138 --> 01:45:50.430
All right, let's renegotiate. 60-40.

01:45:50.597 --> 01:45:54.472
You have nothing to negotiate with.
James has the coins.

01:45:54.638 --> 01:45:57.430
And an obscure sense of loyalty.

01:45:58.888 --> 01:46:00.097
You need to disappear.

01:46:00.263 --> 01:46:06.013
You'll be at the top of the short list 
of suspects and we can't protect you.

01:46:07.638 --> 01:46:10.972
And I thought we are friends.
-We are.

01:46:11.138 --> 01:46:14.680
As I said:
Country first.

01:46:14.805 --> 01:46:16.847
Wrong.

01:46:18.222 --> 01:46:21.597
Friendship and family first.

01:46:26.763 --> 01:46:31.805
BRITISH EMBASSY
MADRID

01:46:45.805 --> 01:46:47.722
Gentlemen.

01:46:50.597 --> 01:46:54.013
Do you have the coordinates?
-Just a moment.

01:46:58.597 --> 01:47:00.680
Tougher than expected.

01:47:01.472 --> 01:47:02.888
But I have them.

01:47:05.722 --> 01:47:07.388
Care to do the honors?

01:47:21.138 --> 01:47:23.347
It's in Europe.

01:47:25.888 --> 01:47:27.763
France.

01:47:32.138 --> 01:47:33.805
Paris?

01:47:34.013 --> 01:47:35.722
Shit...

01:47:36.263 --> 01:47:39.638
According to this Francis Drake 
buried his fortune underneath--

01:47:39.763 --> 01:47:42.513
Under the Eiffel Tower.

01:47:47.472 --> 01:47:51.597
He switched the coins.
That clever fucker!

01:47:57.263 --> 01:48:03.763
SAINT TROPEZ
FRANCE

01:48:10.138 --> 01:48:14.055
You knew this whole time 
that James was gonna try and screw you?

01:48:14.222 --> 01:48:17.513
I thought he might.
He's a good man.

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:22.222
But he gave his loyalty to a flag
and the code of honor that goes with it.

01:48:23.138 --> 01:48:26.138
How did you manage 
to switch out the coins?

01:48:26.347 --> 01:48:28.388
What do you think?

01:48:30.222 --> 01:48:31.138
I don't know.

01:48:31.305 --> 01:48:33.888
I was there the whole time.
I didn't see anything.

01:48:34.097 --> 01:48:35.597
Of course not.

01:48:39.222 --> 01:48:40.722
OK.

01:48:41.138 --> 01:48:43.388
Full house. Here we go.

01:48:44.222 --> 01:48:45.722
Come on.

01:48:47.638 --> 01:48:49.680
All right.

01:48:54.013 --> 01:48:55.597
Europe.

01:48:59.388 --> 01:49:02.680
One of us going home,
it's buried in London.

01:49:02.847 --> 01:49:05.513
I guess that's the sign 
I should call my dad.

01:49:05.722 --> 01:49:08.388
Where in London, Klaus? Zoom in.

01:49:14.263 --> 01:49:15.638
Oh shit.

01:49:24.347 --> 01:49:25.972
Where?

01:49:26.138 --> 01:49:27.597
LONDON 2012

01:49:27.722 --> 01:49:30.722
ONE MONTH BEFORE 
THE LONDON 2012 OLYMPICS GAMES

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:40.472
Miss Vogel?

01:49:40.906 --> 01:49:41.683
Yes?

01:49:41.722 --> 01:49:43.513
Welcome to the Bank of England.

01:49:44.263 --> 01:49:45.477
Thank you.

01:49:45.577 --> 01:49:50.577
