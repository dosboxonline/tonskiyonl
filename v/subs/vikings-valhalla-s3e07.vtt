WEBVTT

00:25.859 --> 00:26.693
Look.

00:47.839 --> 00:48.923
Have you seen Harald?

00:49.716 --> 00:52.177
He slept again in the longhouse
with your parents.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.018
It's the traders. They are coming.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.398
It is the traders!

01:06.316 --> 01:07.233
They're back.

01:24.375 --> 01:27.629
Akí! Akí!

01:28.338 --> 01:29.756
What happened?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.258
From an axe.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.510
Someone killed him.

01:34.385 --> 01:35.887
Who would do that?

01:36.721 --> 01:38.223
Who would do that to Akí?

01:40.683 --> 01:41.935
Where is my father?

01:44.604 --> 01:47.482
Welcome. We have so much to trade.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.776
Your boats will not be able
to carry it all.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.570
Did you kill Akí and steal our boat?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.906
What are you talking about?
I did not kill anyone.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.407
He has been murdered

01:56.491 --> 01:59.494
and no one does anything around here
without your permission.

02:02.413 --> 02:03.873
I demand a Thing.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.462
I demand you to be put on trial
for the murder of Akí.

02:10.213 --> 02:13.967
Do not test me, daughter.
I'm the leader here, not you.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.387
You are not my leader.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.390
You are just an old man
terrified of the future.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.858
It appears my father wants
a trial by combat.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.903
Let the gods decide
which one of us is right.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.414
I do not wish to kill you, daughter.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.667
Then I will kill you.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.475
And now, you will learn a hard lesson.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.611
The gods have spoken.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.864
Submit to a trial or face death.

03:59.948 --> 04:04.369
If you kill me,
you'll never see your son again.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.997
What have you done to him?

04:10.667 --> 04:13.002
Answer me. Where is Harald?

04:14.921 --> 04:18.216
He is safe. As long as I am safe.

04:18.299 --> 04:21.302
You wouldn't hurt him just to punish me.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.476
Of course not.

04:31.562 --> 04:35.900
Just the same as your people
do not hurt me.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.032
Take her away!

04:44.534 --> 04:46.869
You would be wise to stay out of this.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.246
What are you doing?

04:48.329 --> 04:51.291
She needs to relearn her place
in this family.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.337
Take her to the storehouse!

05:14.897 --> 05:20.403
There is no golden land.
I know. I have tried to find it.

05:20.987 --> 05:25.450
And I tried my best to convince Freydis
of this, but she wouldn't listen.

05:25.533 --> 05:31.664
I took her boats from her
and she still persisted in this myth.

05:32.915 --> 05:36.461
If you had followed her,
you would all be dead.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.301
No, Freydis will come around in time
and hopefully you will too.

05:43.384 --> 05:48.514
But… if we work together,

05:48.598 --> 05:52.310
we can turn Greenland
into the golden land.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.270
Yes?

05:57.315 --> 05:58.149
Yes.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.693
You had no reason to kill Akí.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.614
Hmm.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.705
What is your name, girl?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.624
- Hrefna.
- Hrefna.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.467
Hrefna, I know you are confused.

06:24.550 --> 06:29.847
But believe me when I tell you
the Greenland winter is coming

06:29.931 --> 06:33.643
and it is not like the winters
you knew back home.

06:33.726 --> 06:40.358
It is long. It is brutal.
And your tents will not keep you safe.

06:40.441 --> 06:45.530
Your only chance of survival
is to be within these walls.

06:46.906 --> 06:47.782
With us.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.358
Let us pray.

07:25.361 --> 07:28.322
Oh Lord, we thank you
for our safe return to Norway.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.626
Here.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.423
My father would have wished
a true Viking to have it.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.091
Thank you, Lord Magnus.

08:16.412 --> 08:20.374
My father's body.
It is not decomposed.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.919
How can this be?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.800
A second miracle has occurred.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.262
Praise be to God.

08:40.269 --> 08:43.606
Surely my father will be sainted now.

08:44.899 --> 08:50.988
Come, let us give our thanks
to our Lord Jesus Christ. Come.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.620
A miracle.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.877
And you were there to witness it.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.074
You have grieved long enough.

09:37.159 --> 09:37.994
Get out.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.623
I have two stories for you.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.960
Tell me which one you prefer.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.545
I said get out!

09:48.296 --> 09:51.424
I am your Empress and you will obey me!

09:52.592 --> 09:58.514
In my first story, the Empress grieved
for her beloved Romanos.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.977
Then, to the great joy of her people,

10:03.060 --> 10:07.690
she fell in love
with the most esteemed General Maniakes.

10:09.108 --> 10:13.070
They quickly married
and he became Emperor.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.323
That will never happen.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.408
He did not love her either at first,

10:17.491 --> 10:21.746
but she found so many ways to delight him

10:21.829 --> 10:26.500
that, well,
they developed an understanding.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.253
A mythic tale.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.385
The second story…

10:38.304 --> 10:40.014
I do not like so much.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.518
The Empress was so overcome with grief,

10:45.978 --> 10:48.189
that she took a knife

10:48.856 --> 10:55.529
and drew its blade down the length
of her beautiful arms.

10:56.822 --> 11:00.910
And General Maniakes still became Emperor.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.164
He just found another wife.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.660
When is my execution?

11:43.285 --> 11:45.037
Tomorrow. Midday.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.692
You want more?

12:15.609 --> 12:16.777
Bring me your friends.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.285


12:29.582 --> 12:33.127
My father has told me
about your travels, Leif Eriksson.

12:33.210 --> 12:37.089
Tell me about Constantinople.
Are the walls as great as I have heard?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.092
They're taller than trees.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.345
And thick as three boats set end to end.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.432
King Canute!

12:48.476 --> 12:51.353
I prayed fervently
that I would not miss your visit.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.608
And God has answered
all your prayers, Magnus.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.196
Magnus is just back from Jomsborg.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.948
How was your mission?

13:03.032 --> 13:06.535
Successful.
I recovered my father's remains

13:06.619 --> 13:09.622
and by a miracle of God
his body has not decomposed.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.500
A miracle indeed.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.462
I would not have believed it either
had I not seen it with my own eyes,

13:16.587 --> 13:19.131
and it has been confirmed by the Church.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.759
You were in Jomsborg?

13:22.801 --> 13:23.636
Yes.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.555
Leif was just there.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.017
To try and find his sister.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.063
- Your sister?
- Freydis Eriksdotter.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.276
Then you saw the devastation.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.656
It appears a great plague had ravaged
the place before we arrived.

13:44.573 --> 13:48.410
All we could find was a shrine to her.
You must have seen it.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.539
I saw many things.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.752
Including your ship sunk in the harbor.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.592
Destroyed by a landslide
as we were departing.

14:05.302 --> 14:06.554
Landslide. Really?

14:09.515 --> 14:10.683
What are the odds?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.812
We were most fortunate to have survived.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.023
I truly believe it was the hand of God.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.528
Indeed.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.332
Hilde, I must help Freydis.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.251
If you try, he will kill you.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.754
Let me worry about that.
Just tell me where he has taken Harald.

14:40.838 --> 14:41.755
I do not know.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.180
I think you do.

14:57.396 --> 15:01.442
Lang returned today with goods
from the Kalaallit people in the North.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.444
They are good people.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.781
If Erik left Harald with them,
he will be taken care of.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.116
How do I get there?

15:09.199 --> 15:11.535
By boat, it is at least a week's journey.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.330
- And on foot?
- It is much longer.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.498
You must cross the mountains.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.630
I need to see Freydis before I go.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.277
You will pay for this, Father.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.161
I called a meeting of your people.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.374
I told them what will happen
when the cold winds blow

15:59.375 --> 16:03.671
and I made it clear what will happen
if they choose to fight against me.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.299
They have agreed to follow me.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.801
You gave them no choice.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.095
Because you gave me no choice.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.394
You say you're following a vision.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.188
Well, I'm following mine.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.986
I prayed for salvation.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.739
And the gods sent me you.

16:36.954 --> 16:42.418
Leif used to say, "You created this prison
for yourself because of your actions."

16:44.962 --> 16:46.505
Now I see he is right.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.519
It will grow cold tonight, daughter.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.355
It is a lot warmer in the longhouse.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.442
I have been cold before.
You will never break me.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.694
I do not need to break you.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.948
Just your followers.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.469
I demand
you come out and fight.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.845
Archers!

17:53.697 --> 17:56.950
All hail, Canute.
The new King of England.

18:02.790 --> 18:07.795
Emma of Normandy.
Be my wife, help me rule the North.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.256
Yes, my king.

18:34.655 --> 18:39.993
I am His Holiness the Pope,
God's most esteemed messenger on Earth.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.579
And, uh, who are you?

18:42.663 --> 18:47.543
I am Canute the Great.
King of the Northern Empire.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.253
Oh!

18:51.338 --> 18:53.132
The power!

18:59.346 --> 19:02.599
Is there somebody here
who has betrayed me?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.935
Because this feast is not over

19:05.018 --> 19:07.563
until I have chopped off
at least one head.

19:33.547 --> 19:37.801
As someone who is considering
converting to your faith,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.263
I would find it inspirational

19:41.346 --> 19:44.349
if I could witness
your father's miracle myself.

19:45.225 --> 19:48.020
Would you mind if I see Olaf's body?

19:50.105 --> 19:51.023
Not at all.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.027
Bishop Grimketel can arrange that.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.572
No. I'm afraid it is not possible.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.575
Olaf's body is now considered sacred.

20:02.659 --> 20:03.911
During his beatification,

20:03.994 --> 20:06.622
it must only be tended to
by the most reverent nuns

20:06.705 --> 20:09.374
and protected until we receive
confirmation from Rome

20:09.458 --> 20:10.834
of Olaf's canonization.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.252
Hmm.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.295
Rules.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.843
Family. Friends.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.181
Thank you for joining me here in Kattegat,

20:25.015 --> 20:29.019
under this roof where so many great things
have happened for me.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.480
For our people.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.733
And perhaps, for one of you.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.487
Is that not why you are here?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.908
To learn if your destiny
has a throne in it.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.459
Prince Edward and Prince Alfred,
sons of Æthelred and Emma.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.297
And Svein, already a king.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.597
And Harefoot, chomping at the bit.

21:07.182 --> 21:12.020
Willing to slay a thousand Wends
to prove that he is ready to wear a crown.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.195
Am I forgetting someone?

21:21.697 --> 21:22.864
- Harthacanute.
- Oh.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.368
Of course…

21:28.245 --> 21:29.329
Harthacanute.

21:31.164 --> 21:34.960
You too have a seat
at this table of princes.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.045
King-to-be.

21:38.964 --> 21:39.965
Or maybe not.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.386
Leif Eriksson.

21:45.762 --> 21:50.851
You have been to many places,
the Rus, Egypt, Constantinople, Sicily.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.732
And you have met
with many powerful rulers, have you not?

21:57.482 --> 21:58.525
One or two.

21:59.151 --> 22:03.864
Tell me, in all your experience
what makes a king successful?

22:04.948 --> 22:05.782
Strength.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.077
Two types of strength.

22:09.911 --> 22:12.164
Two types. Tell us.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.375
Strength of mind. Intelligence.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.712
Intelligence. Interesting.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.924
Edward, stand before your king.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.684
Your father was a great king.

22:33.727 --> 22:37.981
And your mother, we know,
a great queen twice over.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.442
Do you agree with Leif…

22:41.151 --> 22:44.446
that intelligence is an important quality
in a king?

22:44.529 --> 22:48.408
I do, Your Highness.
The most important quality.

22:48.492 --> 22:53.872
And do you believe that you would make
a great king of England?

22:54.706 --> 22:57.584
I would make an excellent king, my lord.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.668
But wait.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.506
Leif, you said
there were two types of strength.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.466
What is the second?

23:05.884 --> 23:07.469
Physical strength.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.848
The power to defend your position.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.560
And your words.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.773
And who here possesses that strength?

23:19.856 --> 23:21.691
I can answer that for you, Father.

23:27.489 --> 23:32.369
There is no prince in this room
physically stronger than me.

23:34.121 --> 23:34.955
I agree.

23:36.790 --> 23:41.294
But Leif, which of these two strengths
is more important?

23:42.295 --> 23:43.547
That depends.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.798
On what?

23:46.383 --> 23:47.342
The person.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.428
Interesting.

23:53.515 --> 23:57.310
Then let us decide
who has the real strength

23:58.061 --> 24:01.356
to become ruler of England.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.199
You must stop this.

24:12.159 --> 24:15.412
And who will stop this when I am gone?

24:24.045 --> 24:25.046
No!

24:37.475 --> 24:40.270
I think it is obvious
who the next King of England should be.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.607
It is me.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.571
I will be the next King of England.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.240
Is that so, my youngest son?

24:52.324 --> 24:53.533
It is.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.452
So you would kill us all, little brother?

24:55.535 --> 25:00.081
No. Svein has no interest in England,
so I'd leave him in Norway.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.500
Thank you, Your Highness.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.463
Next, I'd let you kill
both Edward and Alfred,

25:06.546 --> 25:10.091
for left to their own devices
they are extremely dangerous.

25:10.175 --> 25:14.888
And after I have done you this service,
what is to stop me from killing you?

25:14.971 --> 25:16.806
Do you want to try and find out?

25:20.602 --> 25:23.980
My huscarls are the strongest Vikings
in the world.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.691
That is why I will be King of England.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.778
Now I'm tired of this game.

25:30.528 --> 25:33.073
Do you think it is a game, Harthacanute?

25:33.156 --> 25:36.576
Of course it is, Father.
We already have a king… you.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.246
To Canute the Great.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.625
The first Viking king of England.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.420
To Canute the Great! <i>Skol!</i>

25:51.091 --> 25:51.925
Thank you.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.722
But I will not live forever.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.519
Therefore, this is my command.

26:04.980 --> 26:10.568
Harthacanute, you will go to Denmark,
where you will become its king.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.573
Prince Edward and Alfred,
you will return to Normandy

26:15.657 --> 26:17.784
to continue your work there.

26:19.536 --> 26:20.745
And Harefoot…

26:21.705 --> 26:26.543
you will become
Harthacanute's regent in Denmark.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.338
His guardian?

26:30.422 --> 26:31.339
Yes.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.304
And what about England?

26:40.056 --> 26:43.435
There will be no King of England.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.864
It will be ruled by a queen.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.247
All hail Queen Emma.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.166
All hail Queen Emma.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.340
Queen Emma.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.385
No fighting.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.637
There's plenty for all.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.671
What news?

29:17.714 --> 29:19.674
We have a new emperor.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.719
General Maniakes has married
the Empress Zoe.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.225
Sleep well.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.896
We have a big day ahead.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.236
We can now get
the same ornaments and skins

29:40.320 --> 29:41.571
from other settlements,

29:41.654 --> 29:42.989
closer to Iceland.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.867
If you have nothing to trade,

29:45.950 --> 29:48.411
there is no reason
to come all this way anymore.

29:48.495 --> 29:52.207
I have been keeping this until last.

30:00.089 --> 30:03.343
Now here is a reason to come back again.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.811
This is impressive.

30:14.896 --> 30:15.855
Where did you get it?

30:15.939 --> 30:19.067
People who make these swords
live with me now.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.986
And we will be making
many more of those in the future.

30:34.165 --> 30:37.710
Lang. Erik says to get a drink.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.806
Freydis.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.266
Stígr.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.726
Have you found Harald?

30:54.686 --> 30:57.021
Mother believes
he's with the Kalaallit people.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.194
They will be traveling
to their winter home soon.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.071
I need to get out and find him.

31:05.154 --> 31:08.658
Freydis, even if you could reach him
and get back safely,

31:08.741 --> 31:09.993
we'd still be prisoners.

31:10.076 --> 31:11.578
I am his mother.

31:13.162 --> 31:15.373
I can find Harald.
But only you can free us.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.548
When are the traders leaving?

31:23.631 --> 31:24.841
In the morning.

31:26.801 --> 31:27.886
Find my son.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.848
I will find us a boat and a new captain.

31:54.579 --> 31:58.249
Go. Do what you must for your people.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.045
Mother!

32:38.998 --> 32:39.999
Where were you?

32:43.086 --> 32:44.170
I was not invited.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.759
He made the boy child King of Denmark.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.889
And me? Nothing but a servant.

32:59.018 --> 33:01.187
There's much to learn from the boy child.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.357
For a start he does not throw tantrums.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.695
He also made Emma ruler of England.

33:08.778 --> 33:09.946
Hmm.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.073
It's not surprising.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.829
And that does not upset you?

33:18.621 --> 33:20.957
If I were to let
every small thing upset me,

33:22.834 --> 33:25.086
I would not have accomplished
all that I have.

33:29.882 --> 33:32.051
There are always advantages…

33:33.469 --> 33:36.764
to any situation
if you keep your wits about you.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.393
Such as?

33:42.020 --> 33:42.854
No.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.481
You tell me.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.372
My rivals for the throne will be
in Denmark and Normandy.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.874
Mmm-hmm.

34:05.877 --> 34:06.711
What else?

34:09.964 --> 34:11.174
After Canute dies…

34:13.968 --> 34:16.054
what he wants becomes irrelevant.

34:19.098 --> 34:21.976
Isn't that a better feeling
than throwing a plate of food?

34:36.908 --> 34:37.825
Who's there?

34:39.494 --> 34:40.495
Can't sleep?

34:42.872 --> 34:44.123
Me neither.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.590
I keep thinking about the rocks
that destroyed your ship.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.178
Didn't look like the hand of God to me.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.848
It looked more like the hand of my sister.

35:13.194 --> 35:19.033
It also… didn't look like
there'd been a plague.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.746
It looked like there'd been a fight.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.836
Tell me.

35:32.797 --> 35:33.798
What did you see?

35:35.591 --> 35:37.885
I… I saw…

35:41.597 --> 35:46.018
He is the devil. Magnus.
Evil runs through his veins.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.396
It is not his father we brought back.

35:48.938 --> 35:52.692
And it was not a plague as he said.
He poisoned them.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.487
Only a few survived and they escaped
on one of our ships.

35:58.197 --> 35:59.031
Freydis…

36:01.993 --> 36:03.202
Was she one of them?

36:06.205 --> 36:09.375
I never saw her. Only her grave.

36:12.378 --> 36:13.880
So Magnus poisoned her.

36:16.799 --> 36:17.633
Yes.

36:26.934 --> 36:30.188
He has already left. After the feast.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.065
Where?

36:34.984 --> 36:38.529
To the North.
To gather the support of the Jarls.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.061
Safe travels, Father.

37:16.734 --> 37:19.320
I still cannot believe
you're sending me to babysit.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.241
You have much to learn
about ruling a country.

37:24.951 --> 37:27.703
Being regent will give you
that opportunity.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.123
I understand.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.389
Goodbye, Canute.

37:49.308 --> 37:52.853
I am under no illusion who has been
ruling Norway all these years.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.733
You're free to return to Mercia
if you wish.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.905
Thank you, but I have made this my home.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.533
And I have reasons to remain.

38:11.122 --> 38:11.956
Good reasons.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.514
- Alfred.
- Mother.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.695
I can't believe he's sending me
back to Normandy.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.908
He's not sending you back. I am.

38:49.493 --> 38:50.536
You're not ready.

38:52.788 --> 38:56.083
Your time is coming, but it is not now.

38:57.376 --> 38:58.336
You must trust me.

39:01.213 --> 39:05.009
When I gave birth to you,
there were already several

39:05.092 --> 39:07.345
of Æthelred's sons
ahead of you for the crown.

39:09.388 --> 39:14.060
But when I held you in my arms,
I knew you would be King.

39:15.811 --> 39:16.729
I still do.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.361
I brought this from Rome for you.

39:24.362 --> 39:28.574
Inside is a piece of wood
from the cross that Jesus died on.

39:30.326 --> 39:33.162
I'm giving it to you with my solemn oath.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.832
One day you will be King of England.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.585
You must be ready for it.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.935
Mother.

40:01.273 --> 40:03.150
Answer me truthfully.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.528
- Will you miss me?
- No.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.489
No. Why not?

40:08.572 --> 40:10.449
Because when I want to be with you

40:10.533 --> 40:13.285
all I have to do is shut my eyes
and feel you in my heart.

40:23.129 --> 40:23.963
Go.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.636
Please take care of my son.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.847
I will let no harm come to him.

40:34.932 --> 40:35.933
Thank you, Harefoot.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.414
Queen Aelfgifu.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.254
A word of warning.

41:05.337 --> 41:10.384
I know. Magnus. I'm fully aware
of the threat on my doorstep.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.345
We would have made a good team.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.891
No, we would have devoured each other.

41:28.652 --> 41:29.987
Thank you, Queen Aelfgifu.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.782
You future is about to become
very difficult.

41:34.742 --> 41:37.286
I pray you have the strength to handle it.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.164
So do I.

41:50.090 --> 41:50.925
My queen.

42:57.491 --> 42:58.867
All right, my friends.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.749
Where do you go
when you've lost everything?

43:09.795 --> 43:10.963
You go back home.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.776
- Until the next summer, my friend.
- Thank you.

43:35.404 --> 43:36.238
Erik.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.408
- Keep well.
- Goodbye.

43:50.377 --> 43:51.378
Daughter!

43:54.757 --> 43:56.634
How was your first night in the cold?

44:07.853 --> 44:12.191
Husband, you are needed in the house.

44:20.282 --> 44:21.283
Take this.

44:37.591 --> 44:38.801
Do you know who I am?

44:42.304 --> 44:45.599
I will be going with you to Kattegat,
do you have a problem with that?

44:47.017 --> 44:47.851
No.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.021
Good.

45:28.559 --> 45:29.560
Move!

45:55.919 --> 45:57.421
Emperor Maniakes.

46:33.248 --> 46:37.503
- Fire!
- Quickly, go! This way.

47:14.081 --> 47:17.793
The prisoner has escaped.
Emperor, Harald has escaped.

47:22.089 --> 47:24.258
Maniakes!

47:27.427 --> 47:28.845
Murderer!

47:29.930 --> 47:30.847
No!

47:31.932 --> 47:34.226
Come face your executioner.

47:34.309 --> 47:36.019
Leave him for me.
