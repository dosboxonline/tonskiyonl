I have to find out.

Torvi told me that you're

04:09.640 --> 04:12.687
I hope that doesn't mean
you wish Queen Gunnhild ill?

04:12.730 --> 04:13.775
Of course not.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.343
I respect her.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.736
I want her
to be safe and well.

I'm grateful, King Hakon.

You've made many promises.

I trust you will keep them.

05:49.392 --> 05:52.569
My dear King Olaf.

05:52.613 --> 05:55.529
I suppose you have come
to pledge your allegiance.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.792
It was not well done.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.576
It was not as you arranged.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.013
Still, I am King now.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.843
King of Norway.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.106
And you owe me allegiance.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.674
I cannot.

06:13.721 --> 06:18.290
What is so difficult
for you, old man?

06:21.816 --> 06:23.295
It was a genuine vote.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.429
I won.

06:26.473 --> 06:30.781
I wanted Bjorn
to be the first King
of Norway.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.783
[inhales]

06:32.827 --> 06:34.698
There were many
who thought differently.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.832
They didn't want Bjorn.

06:37.875 --> 06:41.836
It was too obvious
for them to vote for Bjorn.

06:41.879 --> 06:47.798
They wanted someone
who represented
ordinary people.

06:47.842 --> 06:51.367
And that's why
they voted for me...

06:52.890 --> 06:54.675
but you still
won't accept it.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.721
No.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.636
I won't accept it.

It is a tragedy.

07:04.728 --> 07:05.686

07:09.733 --> 07:12.736
I must do to you
what you did to me, Olaf.

07:20.178 --> 07:25.662
I must throw you into prison
until you see the error
of your ways.

07:27.359 --> 07:31.886
Or until you die.
I don't mind either way.

07:31.929 --> 07:34.062
Let me be!

07:34.105 --> 07:39.763
I will walk to eternity
in my own shoes.

07:39.807 --> 07:40.764
Hmm.

07:42.505 --> 07:45.508
[singing in Old Norse]

08:12.970 --> 08:16.583
So, it was always the truth
that the death of Ragnar

08:16.626 --> 08:18.541
would bring calamities
beyond imagining.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.196
I only see things.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.504
I don't make them.

08:24.547 --> 08:30.553
I fore-suffer them,
lying in the damp earth
beneath these walls.

08:32.468 --> 08:36.603
You told Lagertha
that she would be
killed by a son of Ragnar.

08:36.646 --> 08:39.301
I say only what I see,

08:39.344 --> 08:44.262
and I know that humankind
cannot bear too much reality.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.354
Was it Ivar?

08:49.398 --> 08:51.922
It was Ivar...

08:51.966 --> 08:55.186
and yet it was not Ivar.

08:55.230 --> 08:59.147
Ivar is guilty and innocent
at the same time.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.105
I need to know.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.151
You will know.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.284
And then you will wish
that you did not know.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.984
Like Hali...

09:10.027 --> 09:13.596
we are all on our way
to Valhalla.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.428
Hali?

[breathing heavily]

09:22.823 --> 09:23.998
No!

09:24.999 --> 09:26.609
No, Torvi.

09:26.653 --> 09:27.958
Hali is dead.

09:45.802 --> 09:46.847
Farewell, Hali.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.327
Farewell, my son.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.594
The gods decided to take you
to themselves
before I was ready.

09:56.204 --> 09:58.859
But at least you will
soon be with Lagertha again,

09:59.860 --> 10:01.296
in the Halls of the Aesir.

10:08.564 --> 10:09.609
Sweet Hali...

10:13.700 --> 10:17.051
you are not gone because you
will always be in our hearts.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.361
And we love you.

10:55.872 --> 10:56.917
Torvi.

10:58.745 --> 10:59.789
You are wounded.

11:01.443 --> 11:02.879
Can there be no end
to this grief?

11:04.054 --> 11:06.100
Lagertha?

11:06.143 --> 11:07.405
She reached Kattegat.

11:09.756 --> 11:10.887
But then someone killed her.

11:16.284 --> 11:19.156
You know why she wanted
so badly to go to Kattegat?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.985
[breathing heavily]

11:22.029 --> 11:26.163
She wanted to tell you
that we fought and defeated
White Hair and his bandits.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.731
She wanted you to know
the courage of your son.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.298
You should be so proud.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.695
[exhales]

11:39.307 --> 11:42.353
Lagertha must have
a great funeral.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.225
She meant so much
to so many.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.055
And I will return for it.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.971
No, you are
still too weak.

11:51.014 --> 11:54.017
I was weak when
I did not go back to
Kattegat with Lagertha.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.282
Perhaps I could
have saved her life.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.807
I will not be weak now,
when we say goodbye to her.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.114
[cries]

12:04.158 --> 12:05.246
[Asa] Don't cry.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.033

12:15.865 --> 12:17.345
We leave for
Kattegat tomorrow.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.048
Warm yourself.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.833
Have something
strong to drink.

13:57.532 --> 14:00.578
There is nothing to do
except look forward
to the spring.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.060
[inhales]

14:04.104 --> 14:05.105
But life goes on.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.673
We must endure the winter.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.765
Still, we must
amuse ourselves.

14:13.809 --> 14:16.899
I want to skate
on frozen ponds.

14:16.943 --> 14:20.120
I want to cut
the throat of the first pig.

14:20.163 --> 14:23.471
And I want to
hang the mistletoe
for the Christ-Mass.

14:23.514 --> 14:28.650
And I want to bathe naked
in a hot spring...

14:28.693 --> 14:34.917
with hot steam rising,
but ice and snow
all around.

14:36.310 --> 14:40.227
And my breath
will be a geyser,

14:40.270 --> 14:45.841
and my soul
will bathe there
and slake its thirst.

14:48.278 --> 14:52.369
And you, dear Ivar,
the future King
of all Scandinavia...

14:53.588 --> 14:54.894
what would you like?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.550
I would like to walk.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.596
[chuckling]

15:01.639 --> 15:03.163
That would be a miracle.

15:05.295 --> 15:08.516
I've heard that
your God performs miracles.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.215
Jesus Christ...

15:12.259 --> 15:13.521
raised a man
from the dead.

15:15.131 --> 15:16.959
He made a lame man walk.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.570
He fed a thousand people
with just a few
loaves and fishes.

15:19.614 --> 15:23.183
I don't think it's too much
to ask of Him to cure
a simple cripple, is it?

15:25.794 --> 15:29.624
We will all pray
for that miracle,
Ivar the Boneless.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.324
What about you,
Prince Oleg?

15:36.022 --> 15:39.373
What is it that
amuses you?

15:39.416 --> 15:41.331
What is it that
you really want?

15:41.375 --> 15:44.334
As usual,
I want the impossible.

15:47.381 --> 15:50.166
I want to go back
into my mother's womb.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.432
I want to float there...

15:55.476 --> 15:57.347
in that small,
limitless universe...

15:59.001 --> 16:00.263
among the stars.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.180
With no beginning, no end.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.618
Waiting for the new world
to begin.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.797
I know we have
all been here before.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.366
We're constantly reborn.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.240
It's what I believe.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.115
Don't you, Ivar?

16:30.467 --> 16:32.295
Yes.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.905
That's also what I believe.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.266
[indistinct shouting]

17:09.289 --> 17:10.333
[Asa] Ubbe!

17:11.291 --> 17:12.640
Asa!

17:12.683 --> 17:14.424
Oh, sweetheart.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.512
You are safe.

17:16.383 --> 17:17.906
But Hali is dead.

17:17.949 --> 17:18.950
I know.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.042
But what a brave warrior
he was.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.479
I am certain that he is
on his way to Valhalla.

17:39.493 --> 17:42.365
I am so sorry.
I should have let you go.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.326
I loved him.
You must know that.

17:47.588 --> 17:48.893
I know.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.331
We all did.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.203
Now he's waiting
for Lagertha.

18:04.822 --> 18:08.609
This must be
a magnificent funeral.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.394
Greater than anything else
in the memory of our folk.

18:14.919 --> 18:19.141
Your mistress,
the famous shield-maiden
Lagertha, is dead.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.492
But we cannot let her
sail to Valhalla alone.

18:22.536 --> 18:26.279
Someone must serve her
in the next world
and accompany her there.

18:26.322 --> 18:31.545
I do not want to sacrifice
a slave who might be unwilling
to perform these sacred duties.

18:31.588 --> 18:34.983
I believe it must be done
willingly and joyfully,

18:35.026 --> 18:38.900
and that one of you is fated
to be that person.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.772
Who would willingly
sacrifice themselves
to go with Lagertha?

18:41.816 --> 18:43.426
[al] I will!

18:44.775 --> 18:45.776
[Torvi] I will.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.786
I will go with her.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.050
[crowd murmuring]

19:03.968 --> 19:05.927
I cannot allow it, Torvi.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.190
You are carrying a child.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.062
The child has not agreed
to go to the next world
with Lagertha.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.768
It must be one of you,

19:20.811 --> 19:22.770
and the gods have
already made their choice.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.468
Let them show us.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.392
[cawing]

19:45.271 --> 19:46.663
What is your name?

19:46.707 --> 19:48.578
Gyda.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.624
I was named
after Lagertha's daughter,

19:50.667 --> 19:53.235
who died in a plague
when she was young.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.020
My mother said my fate
would always be linked
to Lagertha.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.763
Are you happy, Gyda?

19:59.807 --> 20:01.548
How could you ask?

20:01.591 --> 20:03.898
To be chosen by the gods.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.465
Who would not be happy?

20:08.903 --> 20:10.339
[cheers and applause]

20:12.820 --> 20:13.908
[man 1] Well done!

20:26.312 --> 20:29.489
[man 2] Spices! Come pick
your spices from me!

20:33.057 --> 20:37.061
I have a message for you,
Ivar the Boneless.

20:37.105 --> 20:40.151
Prince Dir sends you greetings.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.850
He is safe, well,
and restored.

20:42.893 --> 20:46.593
But, for the time being,
still in hiding.

20:46.636 --> 20:50.597
However, he hopes
that one day
he will be strong enough

20:50.640 --> 20:53.904
to help you achieve
your ambition...

20:53.948 --> 20:56.516
which is also his ambition.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.692
[cheers and applause]

21:05.916 --> 21:08.745
He sends you this cross...

21:08.789 --> 21:12.227
by which you will know him,
and is a token
of his enduring friendship.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.752
Now, I must leave.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.493
Please do not turn
or watch me go.

21:21.932 --> 21:24.979
[man laughing]

21:25.022 --> 21:27.373
[man] Please,
come and help me.
I need some help holding this.

21:35.642 --> 21:36.730
Who was that?

21:37.905 --> 21:39.994
He didn't tell me his name.

21:40.037 --> 21:43.867
But he told me
that Prince Dir is safe

21:43.911 --> 21:46.783
and that he is prepared
to help us when the time
has come.

21:48.785 --> 21:51.179
Then he is an angel
sent from God.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.706
You're right.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.752
An angel sent from the gods.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.365
He hasn't spoken.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.629
He hardly eats.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.239
Sometimes he cries out
in his sleep.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.894
What does he say?

22:10.938 --> 22:12.766
[Amma]
Nothing that makes any sense.

22:13.549 --> 22:14.594
[Ubbe] Brother.

22:15.638 --> 22:16.683
Hvitserk!

22:18.554 --> 22:19.599
Talk to me.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.819
[Ubbe] Why did you
go into the forest?

22:24.255 --> 22:26.388
Did you want to die, huh?

22:26.432 --> 22:27.694
Why would you want to die?

22:28.651 --> 22:29.609
Lagertha's dead!

22:32.699 --> 22:34.265
Did you know
Lagertha was dead?

22:41.621 --> 22:43.753
I... I need to sleep.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.755
Talk to me.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.670
I don't want to talk.
I want to sleep.

23:20.268 --> 23:21.617
[choral singing]

23:24.664 --> 23:26.622
[indistinct chatter]

23:49.732 --> 23:54.694
Behold, I see my mistress,
seated in paradise.

23:54.737 --> 23:58.045
Paradise is beautiful
and green.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.526
And with her
are shield-maidens.

24:00.569 --> 24:01.744
She calls me.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.140
Take me to her.

24:06.183 --> 24:09.665
[viking] Gyda, beloved
of the gods,

24:09.709 --> 24:11.885
you must drink
to your mistress,

24:11.928 --> 24:15.062
and in honor
of Frey and Freya.

24:15.105 --> 24:18.892
[Gyda] I will gladly drink.
I will drink
to my mistress, Lagertha.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.111
And to Frey and Freya,

24:21.155 --> 24:23.853
and to all the gods
gathered here today.

24:23.897 --> 24:28.858
We must prepare you
so you are ready to be received
in Valhalla by the gods.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.628
[woman] Gyda.

25:01.587 --> 25:02.849
You are Gyda.

25:04.807 --> 25:09.290
You have declared yourself
a willing sacrifice.

25:09.333 --> 25:12.206
You wish to accompany
your mistress
to the other world.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.295
Yes.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.862
Then you know
who I am.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.822
I am called
the Angel of Death.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.782
Yes. I know.

25:24.827 --> 25:27.917
I can kill you with a knife.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.180
Or a cord around your neck.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.271
Which would you prefer?

25:35.185 --> 25:36.230
A knife.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.275
Thank you.

25:46.806 --> 25:47.981
Are you afraid?

25:49.286 --> 25:50.287
No.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.161
I know that death is
not the end.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.642
So, I'm not afraid.

25:58.687 --> 26:02.561
The Valkyries
will ride alongside

26:02.604 --> 26:04.780
and guide you to Valhalla.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.625
Look at my eyes.

26:33.679 --> 26:34.680
Look!

26:41.077 --> 26:42.731
[gasps and shrieks]

26:53.568 --> 26:54.874
[exhales]

28:18.784 --> 28:19.785
Whoo!

28:30.230 --> 28:31.622
[Katia sighs]

28:34.451 --> 28:36.366
Now are you happy,
my love?

28:36.410 --> 28:41.197
Of course.
This was my dream,
and you made it come true.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.245
This was
the simplest dream of all.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.205
But the rest will follow.

28:53.993 --> 28:55.168
You understand, don't you?

29:02.262 --> 29:03.959
It's only the beginning.

29:05.439 --> 29:06.657
[chuckles]

29:08.616 --> 29:09.835
[both laugh]

29:11.010 --> 29:13.229
It's only the beginning!

29:15.231 --> 29:17.625
-[cheering]
-[drumming]

30:16.466 --> 30:17.903
[drumming and cheering stops]

30:49.935 --> 30:55.636
Farewell, Lagertha,
Queen of Kattegat,
Mother of Norway.

30:55.679 --> 30:58.247
May the gods
love and keep you...

30:58.291 --> 31:02.338
and may your reunion
with Ragnar be joyful,
noisy

31:03.383 --> 31:04.253
and filled with love.

31:06.777 --> 31:07.909
Farewell, Lagertha...

31:09.128 --> 31:12.522
my shield, my hero.

31:12.566 --> 31:15.482
One day we shall meet again
in the Halls of the Aesir,

31:15.525 --> 31:18.920
and you will teach me
once more how to fight
as a woman

31:18.964 --> 31:21.053
and how to prevail.

31:21.096 --> 31:23.316
For women always prevail.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.492
That is what you taught me.
And that is the truth.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.289
I love you.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.337
There is really nothing else
to say, Lagertha.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.038
I know you will
look after my boys,
Hali and Guthrum.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.912
There will be so much
for you to do...

31:55.348 --> 31:56.436
but don't forget them.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.221
Hali is always hungry.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.402
I must live in the world
without you.

32:08.056 --> 32:12.147
[sobs] But wherever I go,
you will go with me...

32:13.583 --> 32:17.196
and give me courage
and hope.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.365
Goodbye, Grandmother.

32:56.409 --> 33:00.239
Don't worry. The Valkyries
will ride alongside
and guide you to Valhalla.

33:16.211 --> 33:17.343
[sheep bleating]

33:51.333 --> 33:52.247
What is it?

33:54.336 --> 33:55.424
The world has changed.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.303
I think I know.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.046
But I don't want to know.

34:40.774 --> 34:42.123
[indistinct murmurs]

34:56.616 --> 34:57.356
Bjorn.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.315
You don't need
to tell me, Ubbe.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.188
I already know.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.714
My mother is dead.

35:12.719 --> 35:13.850
[sighs]

35:26.341 --> 35:28.387
And nothing will ever
be the same again.

35:39.615 --> 35:40.573
[Bjorn exhales]

35:46.100 --> 35:47.188
[sighs]

35:58.765 --> 36:00.375
I hoped the day
would never come...

36:02.769 --> 36:04.597
when I had to bid you farewell.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.601
[Bjorn] You were always
my strength...

36:09.515 --> 36:10.690
my guide.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.216
You taught me to go on,
no matter what.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.440
You taught me not to be afraid.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.620
And now I see that,
like me...

36:27.663 --> 36:30.492
the earth itself is
unwilling to let you go.

36:30.536 --> 36:33.365
But the gods call you home.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.889
They eagerly await
your arrival in Valhalla...

36:37.282 --> 36:38.805
as does my father.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.464
I wish I could be there...

36:47.683 --> 36:51.121
at your reunion, secretly,

36:51.165 --> 36:54.864
in Odin's glittering,
gold-shielded hall,

36:54.908 --> 36:56.518
surrounded by all the gods.

36:59.695 --> 37:02.350
You are already a legend.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.960
The greatest shield-maiden
of all time.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.095
A hero to thousands
of women.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.099
But, to me, you will
always be my mother...

37:14.667 --> 37:15.755
who bore me...

37:17.539 --> 37:18.714
who raised me...

37:21.543 --> 37:22.675
who protected
and fought for me.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.155
And I swear,
I will fight for you now!

37:35.470 --> 37:39.126
I did not protect you in life,
but I can punish
your murderer after it.

37:44.523 --> 37:45.611
Farewell.

37:50.224 --> 37:52.661
I have loved you more than
I have loved any other.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.141
[inhales deeply]

37:56.099 --> 37:57.492
Farewell, Lagertha.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.103
Farewell.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.417
I love you.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.116
I will miss you.

38:17.686 --> 38:19.209
I will avenge you.

38:24.824 --> 38:25.999
[sighs]

38:32.962 --> 38:34.399
[singing in Norse]

38:58.945 --> 39:00.642
[weeping]

39:11.784 --> 39:13.786
[exhales]

39:13.829 --> 39:15.265
[woman speaking Old Norse]

39:45.339 --> 39:46.384
[sighs]

40:08.101 --> 40:09.102
[shield-maiden] Draw!

40:13.062 --> 40:14.107
Loose!

40:19.852 --> 40:20.853
Loose!

40:25.727 --> 40:26.728
Loose!

40:29.949 --> 40:30.906
Loose!

40:38.740 --> 40:39.741
Pull!

40:51.536 --> 40:52.667
[shouting indistinctly]

40:52.711 --> 40:53.755
[horse neighing]

42:47.652 --> 42:51.569
[Lagertha] In my dreams,
we are always together.

43:14.679 --> 43:16.376
[music playing]
