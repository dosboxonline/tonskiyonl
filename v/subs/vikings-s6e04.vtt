[grunts]

01:17.773 --> 01:19.122
[speaking in Russian]

01:30.960 --> 01:31.961
Igor?

01:34.616 --> 01:36.139
[speaking in Russian]

01:45.801 --> 01:47.107
Hmm?

01:47.585 --> 01:49.892
[groans]

01:49.935 --> 01:51.894
[Igor speaking in Old Norse]

01:55.811 --> 01:57.204
[Ivar chuckles]

01:58.857 --> 02:00.642
[in English] We can talk!

02:00.685 --> 02:04.167
[in English] Yes. We can talk.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.604
Now we can discuss
serious things.

02:06.648 --> 02:07.953
Important things.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.042
Like what?

02:10.086 --> 02:14.177
Like... What do
the gods look like?

02:14.221 --> 02:18.138
There is only one God
and he looks like Oleg.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.011
Mmm-hmm.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.971
Do you know
who you are? Hmm?

02:27.016 --> 02:29.410
I don't understand.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.064
Everything here.

02:32.108 --> 02:35.503
Everything belongs to you.

02:37.679 --> 02:38.854
In this room?

02:38.897 --> 02:41.813
[laughs] No, Igor.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.729
In this whole town, Kiev.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.166
And Novgorod too.

02:47.863 --> 02:51.301
And everything
in the whole of Rus.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.695
The land. The sky.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.785
The villages. The town.
The people.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.874
It's all yours.

03:00.789 --> 03:01.920
You make me laugh.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.923
I know it really
belongs to Oleg.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.839
I'm happy that we can talk

03:07.883 --> 03:11.147
because now I can
explain things to you.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.106
I can explain how
you have been betrayed.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.675
Nothing belongs to Oleg.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.678
Oleg is not a god.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.768
Oleg is nothing, but you,

03:23.812 --> 03:26.336
you are everything.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.773
And everything here
belongs to you.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.344
Remember that.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.958
[indistinct chatter]

03:41.699 --> 03:43.223
[woman] Over here now!

03:43.266 --> 03:44.920
[Viking 1] I'd like to change
his bandage.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.443
[Viking 2] Help me here.

03:46.487 --> 03:49.403
[Viking 3] Cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it!

03:53.624 --> 03:54.669
[Bjorn] We're surrounded.

03:55.844 --> 03:58.150
Let's acquit ourselves well.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.544
I don't intend
to miss out on Valhalla.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.765
[warrior] Bjorn!

04:03.808 --> 04:06.028
We found him in the camp.

04:06.071 --> 04:08.335
He says he needs
to speak to you.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.858
What is the matter?

04:09.901 --> 04:11.773
Haven't you betrayed us enough?

04:11.816 --> 04:14.993
I have a message
from King Olaf.

04:15.037 --> 04:19.781
He won't attack
if you agree to meet him.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.740
He also said you can
forget about all that,

04:22.784 --> 04:24.351
if you kill me.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.574
-[Bjorn grunts]
-[gasps]

04:32.489 --> 04:33.795
[cracks neck]

04:35.013 --> 04:36.885
Tell King Olaf I agree,

04:36.928 --> 04:38.582
but I too have a condition:

04:40.889 --> 04:42.369
I want to see
with my own eyes

04:42.412 --> 04:44.022
that King Harald
is still alive.

04:44.675 --> 04:45.981
[coughing]

04:53.771 --> 04:55.469
Valhalla can wait.

05:06.958 --> 05:10.092
[Lagertha]
As you all must know,
there is a group of bandits

05:10.135 --> 05:12.660
who are attacking
the villages around here.

05:12.703 --> 05:16.228
They might attack us,
so we should be prepared.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.710
Some of you
were shield-maidens.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.408
You don't forget
how to fight.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.714
Probably we fought together
before the walls of Paris,

05:23.758 --> 05:27.152
-if you can still remember?
-Of course, Lagertha.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.286
You must still have
your shields

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
and your weapons
stored somewhere.

05:33.898 --> 05:36.205
Now we all have to fight again.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.947
The women more than the men.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.428
You boys,
you could be look-outs.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.125
You can tell us when
the bandits are around.

05:43.168 --> 05:46.694
And you girls, you look
after the animals. Yes?

05:46.737 --> 05:47.782
[girls] Yes, Lagertha.

05:47.825 --> 05:52.003
You men. You are not so old.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.875
You can still be useful,
can't you?

05:53.918 --> 05:56.356
-[women laughing]
-Yes, we can.

05:56.399 --> 05:59.141
I need you to build better
protection for our stores.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.186
Think of our stores
as our gold.

06:01.230 --> 06:04.886
We can't live without it,
so we must defend it
with our lives.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.453
[all] Yes. We will.

06:06.496 --> 06:10.674
Also, I want everyone
to go into the woods,

06:10.718 --> 06:13.808
and cut suitable staves
for making bows and arrows.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.200
But do
all these things quickly.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.028
There isn't much time.

06:17.072 --> 06:20.249
Lagertha, it doesn't matter
what we do.

06:20.292 --> 06:23.295
We can't beat the bandits.
You know that.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.298
We will all die.

06:27.952 --> 06:30.041
Yes, we will all die.

06:30.085 --> 06:33.001
But not necessarily
when the bandits attack us.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.917
[Viking] Yeah, tie it there.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.875
Bring the boy! All the way!

06:37.919 --> 06:39.486
[door bangs open]

06:44.142 --> 06:46.841
[King Olaf] Ah, Bjorn Ironside.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.104
Please, come and sit down.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.932
Make yourself comfortable.

06:54.065 --> 06:58.113
We three are strangely
brought together again.

06:58.156 --> 07:01.203
Fate works in mysterious ways.

07:01.246 --> 07:04.902
The Norns weave it
and so we believe it.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.688
Skol!

07:13.737 --> 07:14.956
Hmm.

07:16.261 --> 07:20.135
Last night I had a dream.

07:20.178 --> 07:23.225
And in that dream,
I was sitting in a room

07:23.268 --> 07:25.923
with King Harald Finehair

07:25.967 --> 07:28.796
and King Bjorn Ironside.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.319
[laughs]

07:30.362 --> 07:34.497
You know, perhaps everything
is a dream.

07:34.541 --> 07:39.720
And we are spirits and will
someday just melt into the air.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.678
Into thin air.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.072
[Harald] If you care

07:44.115 --> 07:46.596
so little about the real world,

07:46.640 --> 07:49.947
why do you not simply
renounce this kingdom

07:49.991 --> 07:51.949
and go home with your warriors?

07:51.993 --> 07:53.429
[breathing heavily]

07:53.473 --> 07:56.606
Believe me, there is nothing
you can do

07:56.650 --> 08:01.002
that you can make yourself
a popular ruler here.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.264
Nothing!

08:03.004 --> 08:04.048
[King Olaf] Hmm.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.965
If nothing is real,

08:08.009 --> 08:12.056
we must still act as if it was.

08:12.100 --> 08:16.278
But the real mystery
is that now,

08:16.321 --> 08:18.715
both of you are my prisoners.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.500
[scoffs]

08:20.543 --> 08:23.111
It is true, Bjorn Ironside,
you still have an army,

08:23.154 --> 08:27.115
but your army, I believe,
is not strong enough now

08:27.158 --> 08:29.552
to defeat me.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.032
[Bjorn] If our armies
do fight again,

08:31.075 --> 08:33.077
whatever the outcome,

08:33.121 --> 08:35.732
you will be seriously weakened.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.560
In which case,
you will find it hard

08:37.604 --> 08:39.257
to keep hold
of this new kingdom,

08:39.301 --> 08:40.607
as well as your old.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.480
Either way, you won't win.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.092
I will reflect more
on that matter, and, um,

08:48.136 --> 08:51.792
how to resolve our differences.

08:51.835 --> 08:56.753
I am growing tired
of this old way of thinking.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.450
In the meantime,

08:58.494 --> 09:02.716
King Harald, sadly,
must return to your prison,

09:02.759 --> 09:04.326
and you to your camp

09:04.369 --> 09:08.330
where you will
remain surrounded,

09:08.373 --> 09:12.073
but I will arrange
to have food brought to you.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.395
[hammering]

09:30.439 --> 09:33.137
[indistinct chatter]

09:39.143 --> 09:41.319
Will the bandits attack soon?

09:43.191 --> 09:45.106
They might not attack at all.

09:46.237 --> 09:50.633
But, in any case,
you mustn't be afraid.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.418
You mustn't be afraid
for two reasons.

09:53.462 --> 09:57.640
Firstly, because we will all
look after you.

09:57.684 --> 10:02.645
And secondly,
because you are Viking,

10:02.689 --> 10:05.082
the son and daughter
of great warriors.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.215
I'm not afraid! If they attack,

10:07.258 --> 10:10.522
I want to make my mother
and father proud of me!

10:10.566 --> 10:12.002
[chuckles]

10:13.308 --> 10:15.136
I am proud of you.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.965
And you.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.837
[man calling out]

10:24.101 --> 10:25.276
[man] And the next one.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.764
[Viking 1] On the second ship!

10:34.808 --> 10:37.201
[Viking 2] Yes!
Ready for the wedges now!

10:41.597 --> 10:44.252
-[Viking 3] Over here!
-[Viking 2] On the cart!

10:44.295 --> 10:45.819
[Viking 3] I will bring them!

10:47.124 --> 10:48.125
[Viking 2] You are ready?

10:53.565 --> 10:54.697
[gasps]

10:54.741 --> 10:56.046
[addict groaning]

11:04.141 --> 11:05.577
[Amma] Hvitserk.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.103
Hvitserk! Get up!

11:09.886 --> 11:10.931
Get up! Please.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.542
Out!

11:14.195 --> 11:15.892
Out! Move!

11:22.943 --> 11:24.292
Hello, Hvitserk.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.815
[grunting]

11:25.859 --> 11:27.817
I wanted to see you.
I have some news for you.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.211
News? What news?

11:30.254 --> 11:34.432
Good news. I want to give you
some responsibility.

11:34.476 --> 11:37.827
I don't think our family
has ever truly recognized
your talents.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.874
Really?

11:40.917 --> 11:42.353
Yes, you know very well.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.750
So...

11:47.794 --> 11:50.579
I want you to lead a trade
delegation to the East.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.148
You will travel along
the ancient Silk Road,

11:54.191 --> 11:56.716
making trade deals
and contacts all the way.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.503
I hope you agree
to this, Hvitserk.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.027
I'm trying to help you.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.246
I know. I know.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.640
I'll get better.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.731
[whispers] I'll get better.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.559
I won't disappoint you.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.214
Believe me.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.870
[weeping]

12:25.266 --> 12:26.528
[Ubbe grunting]

12:28.225 --> 12:30.401
[Hvitserk] Thank you.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.926
Thank you, brother. [sobbing]

12:42.936 --> 12:45.808
[indistinct chatter]

12:48.158 --> 12:49.594
Now we have time, Ketill.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.772
Time?

12:52.815 --> 12:54.382
Time for you to tell me
what really happened

12:54.425 --> 12:57.211
in Iceland between
Floki and the settlers.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.778
I want the whole story.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.910
The truth.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.913
You know most of it already.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.655
We suffered many early
hardships and difficulties.

13:06.698 --> 13:09.484
There was no food.
Our first crop failed.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.834
There was an evil man
called Eyvind.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.184
He blamed Floki
for every difficulty,

13:14.228 --> 13:16.056
for everything that went wrong.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.623
The rest of us built
a temple to Thor.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.800
Eyvind and his family
burnt it down.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.715
Then his sons...

13:25.543 --> 13:27.719
Killed my son Thorgrim...

13:29.809 --> 13:31.332
[inhales deeply]

13:31.375 --> 13:34.944
And my pregnant daughter
Thorunn.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.254
And you retaliated
for their deaths?

13:41.037 --> 13:42.169
No.

13:43.300 --> 13:46.260
No, Floki told us not to.

13:46.303 --> 13:49.785
He said the settlement
could not survive through
a cycle of killings.

13:58.402 --> 13:59.490
It's not true.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.669
In the end I killed Eyvind
and all of his family.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.327
After all, I am a Viking.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.286
It was a matter of honor.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.158
Floki was a dreamer.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.856
He would have felt crushed
by the destruction
of his dream,

14:16.899 --> 14:19.162
for which you and Eyvind
were responsible!

14:19.206 --> 14:23.688
But still, I can't just accept
that Floki walked away.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.777
Surely someone killed him
and hid the body!

14:27.605 --> 14:29.216
Perhaps
you killed him, Ketill?

14:30.434 --> 14:32.045
No, Bjorn.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.525
Perhaps there was
a confrontation

14:34.569 --> 14:36.397
and you struck him.

14:36.440 --> 14:40.314
No, Bjorn! I had nothing to do
with Floki's disappearance,

14:40.357 --> 14:42.533
I swear to you on my arm-ring.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.101
You better pray
to the gods that

14:45.145 --> 14:47.625
one day Floki returns
to verify your story.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.107
Because up until that day,

14:51.151 --> 14:54.502
you, a man capable
of slaughtering
an entire family,

14:54.545 --> 14:57.635
will to me forever stand
accused of his murder!

15:25.402 --> 15:28.449
Each must die someday.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.366
Even you, Bjorn Ironside.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.151
Even you.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.160
[Hvitserk vomiting]

15:48.251 --> 15:49.731
[groaning]

15:53.865 --> 15:55.476
[panting]

15:57.043 --> 15:58.392
Let me out!

15:58.435 --> 15:59.567
Let me out!

15:59.610 --> 16:00.829
Let me out!

16:03.571 --> 16:05.181
Please, please!

16:07.009 --> 16:08.054
Please.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.971
[gasping]

16:30.990 --> 16:33.209
[wheezing]

16:38.214 --> 16:40.434
[indistinct chatter]

16:49.182 --> 16:50.270
Where is Hvitserk?

16:54.839 --> 16:56.363
Then we'd better go find him.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.541
-Go and find him!
-[Viking] Yes, Ubbe.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.469
[man 1] You lazy dogs.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.861
[man 2] What is this?

17:24.260 --> 17:25.392
[sighs]

17:38.144 --> 17:40.494
Why Hvitserk? Why?

17:40.537 --> 17:42.104
I...

17:43.410 --> 17:45.064
I tried to give you a chance.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.374
I don't think he meant
to disappoint you.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.419
He can't help it.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.032
You will have to leave
without him.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.296
Appoint a leader
among yourselves.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.733
Remember that your mission
is vital to us.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.822
May the gods speed you
along the Silk Road.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.522
[Hvitserk] No, no.

18:14.658 --> 18:17.835
Ubbe, don't be too hard on him.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.581
I tried, but I can't. I can't.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.757
Can't you see that?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.672
I tried, and I can't.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.065
-I love you, brother.
-And you.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.154
I always have
and I always will.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.374
But you have just betrayed me

18:34.417 --> 18:36.376
for the second time
in your life.

18:40.989 --> 18:44.123
Look at you. Look at you.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.257
Get up!

18:49.563 --> 18:51.130
Stand up!

18:51.173 --> 18:52.783
I'm sorry. Ubbe.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.525
-I'm sorry.
-No. It's too late.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.180
[mumbles indistinctly]

18:58.224 --> 18:59.616
I don't want
to see you anymore.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.444
And I have nothing left
to say to you.

19:14.109 --> 19:17.112
[breathing erratically]

19:21.247 --> 19:22.683
[man 1 in distorted voice]
Hvitserk.

19:22.726 --> 19:23.814
[man 2 laughing]

19:31.082 --> 19:33.215
[gasps]

19:33.259 --> 19:36.044
[man in distorted voice]
Hvitserk! Hvitserk!
Hvitserk! Hvitserk!

19:37.306 --> 19:39.047
[laughter continues]

19:40.266 --> 19:41.267
[man] Hvitserk!

19:47.795 --> 19:50.450
[Ivar] I'm here, brother!

19:50.493 --> 19:53.104
My dear, sweet Hvitserk!

19:55.063 --> 19:56.934
Is it true that
you jumped ship

19:56.978 --> 19:59.502
not because you loved me,

19:59.546 --> 20:03.941
but because you needed to be close enough to kill me?

20:15.388 --> 20:16.780
[screaming]

20:24.614 --> 20:27.791
[Ivar] You think
it is your fate.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.446
I know your fate, brother.

20:31.926 --> 20:35.016
Your fate is to be
killed by me.

20:35.059 --> 20:38.280
Please, leave me alone! Please!

20:38.324 --> 20:42.980
[Ivar] No, no, no, no, no.
I will never leave you alone.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.115
[gasps]

21:13.968 --> 21:15.230
You were dreaming.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.674
What is it?

21:24.718 --> 21:26.502
Is it true?

21:26.546 --> 21:29.940
Do I really own all the land
and all the sky?

21:37.078 --> 21:40.255
Yes. It all belongs to you.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.954
And one day, Igor,
you will believe me.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.311
Prince Oleg is asking for you.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.024
You wanted to see me.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.721
Yes.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.464
I wanted to tell you
that I have ordered

22:15.508 --> 22:17.684
the immediate mobilization
of a great army,

22:17.727 --> 22:20.774
and the gathering
and construction
of a great fleet,

22:20.817 --> 22:23.211
for the invasion
of Scandinavia.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.213
The time has finally come.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.129
I am very happy to hear that.

22:28.172 --> 22:30.000
You can be very useful to me.

22:30.044 --> 22:32.916
You are a son
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.832
No one can question
your legitimacy to rule

22:35.876 --> 22:38.269
when I place you
upon the throne.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.492
Oh, so then I will be
your puppet ruler, huh?

22:46.016 --> 22:49.455
Don't mess with me,
Ivar the Boneless.

22:49.498 --> 22:52.545
I'm offering you far more
than you're worth.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.852
You can rule kingdoms.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.767
Who gives a damn
if it's really me

22:57.811 --> 22:59.334
who controls everything?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.815
You will be the king!
You will be famous!

23:04.078 --> 23:06.036
Isn't that what
you Vikings like?

23:07.124 --> 23:08.648
[chuckles softly]

23:11.868 --> 23:13.479
You forget something.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.523
What?

23:15.698 --> 23:17.004
I'm a god.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.049
A descendant of Odin.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.008
You are not a god!

23:21.051 --> 23:22.444
You're not a god,
and my faithless wife

23:22.488 --> 23:24.315
was no saint!
She was a whore!

23:25.491 --> 23:27.797
I told you,
you can be useful.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.190
That should be enough for you!

23:29.233 --> 23:31.932
But don't ever betray me

23:31.975 --> 23:33.890
or I'll stuff
your boneless body

23:33.934 --> 23:35.414
in the casket with my wife!

23:45.075 --> 23:46.555
Oh, my beloved.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.039
[sobs] My beloved forgive me.

24:04.225 --> 24:07.271
Don't take everything
so seriously, Ivar.

24:09.012 --> 24:13.800
[sighs] Widows are
very passionate,
very emotional.

24:13.843 --> 24:16.280
We get carried away sometimes,
you understand?

24:20.197 --> 24:22.504
But I believe
with all my heart...

24:24.463 --> 24:26.203
You are descendant
from Odin.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.512
And of course,
this makes me jealous...

24:34.864 --> 24:36.736
And it makes me
love you.

25:00.150 --> 25:03.110
I have been sitting here
for many hours.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.244
Or perhaps for many days.

25:07.288 --> 25:10.639
I have been meditating
upon the sagas,

25:10.683 --> 25:14.208
the ancient stories,
the histories of our people.

25:15.644 --> 25:21.041
Thinking especially
about the endless

25:21.084 --> 25:23.304
small-scale wars

25:23.347 --> 25:27.177
between all the many
and various kingdoms

25:27.221 --> 25:29.397
of our beloved Norway.

25:30.616 --> 25:35.055
And it seems to me,
these endless,

25:35.098 --> 25:40.974
fruitless wars
are simply ludicrous,

25:41.017 --> 25:45.369
and do nothing to promote
the general interest
of our people.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.024
[Harald] Forgive me,

25:48.068 --> 25:51.288
but you are as guilty
as any other ruler of

25:51.332 --> 25:54.509
provoking and starting
small-scale wars,

25:56.206 --> 25:58.382
for your own advantage.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.341
Look what you have done here.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.605
You speak the truth.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.913
But sometimes the real truth

26:07.827 --> 26:09.916
is hidden from all of us,

26:09.959 --> 26:13.049
beyond the accidents
of time and place,

26:14.137 --> 26:16.444
and has to be revealed.

26:16.487 --> 26:21.057
And the gods,
in their infinite wisdom,

26:21.101 --> 26:24.887
have revealed it to me.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.934
[chuckling]

26:29.500 --> 26:32.242
Well, would it possible
for you to explain

26:32.286 --> 26:35.115
what the gods
have revealed to you?

26:35.158 --> 26:38.988
It is time to give up
the old ways of acting,

26:39.032 --> 26:41.208
the old ways of thinking.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.950
It is time for a rebirth!

26:45.168 --> 26:47.083
For a new beginning.

26:47.127 --> 26:50.434
It is time to elect and anoint

26:50.478 --> 26:54.221
a king for all Norway!

26:54.264 --> 26:59.008
A king who can
unite the people,

26:59.052 --> 27:02.098
to whom the people can
look up to and respect.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.625
And what better man than you,

27:08.278 --> 27:10.846
Bjorn Ironside,

27:10.890 --> 27:14.589
the eldest son of
the great Ragnar Lothbrok,

27:14.633 --> 27:17.331
who now sits
on the right hand of Odin,

27:17.374 --> 27:20.116
in the Halls of the Aesir?

27:20.160 --> 27:24.164
What better king to command

27:24.207 --> 27:29.735
our poor, war-torn,
fractured country?

27:33.739 --> 27:37.046
Of course, all the kings,
queens, Jarls

27:37.090 --> 27:39.222
and petty earls would have
to be summoned

27:39.266 --> 27:42.443
to approve the plan.
But once they do,

27:43.444 --> 27:45.185
I swear to you,

27:45.228 --> 27:47.709
I will relinquish

27:47.753 --> 27:50.973
all my kingdoms, all my power,

27:51.844 --> 27:54.324
to the new savior.

27:54.368 --> 27:58.198
So, go away
and consider my plan.

27:58.241 --> 28:01.636
You are both free to do so.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.335
But don't take long
to consider your verdict.

28:05.379 --> 28:07.294
Oh-so much depends on it.

[horse whinnies]

30:57.986 --> 30:59.074
Here.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.693

31:12.522 --> 31:14.133
Where are they?

31:14.176 --> 31:16.439

Maybe they all ran away.

There is nothing to fear

or death!

34:25.759 --> 34:27.456

34:33.158 --> 34:34.768
Hello, Lagertha.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.859
Poor Hali.

34:38.902 --> 34:41.122
I don't know if I did enough.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.863
I'm sorry.

34:42.906 --> 34:45.300
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.346
You have been so brave.

34:48.173 --> 34:49.739
Was I?

34:49.783 --> 34:50.871
I wasn't sure.

34:51.872 --> 34:53.961
Am I dying, Lagertha?

34:55.832 --> 34:57.660
You've been more than brave.

34:59.314 --> 35:03.492
You are dying, Hali,
but the gods are here.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.583
Odin is here.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.629
He saw how brave you were.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.370
I hope so.

35:11.413 --> 35:15.025
I am telling you the truth.
You believe me, don't you?

35:18.638 --> 35:21.467
Odin will take you to Valhalla.

35:23.599 --> 35:27.037
You will be with
all the great warriors

35:27.081 --> 35:29.170
and heroes of our time.

35:31.738 --> 35:34.741
You will be a special person.

35:34.784 --> 35:38.223
You will be special
because your father

35:38.266 --> 35:39.615
is Bjorn Ironside.

35:39.659 --> 35:43.141
And because you have
been so brave.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.192
You will sit in the great Halls
of the Aesir.

37:39.561 --> 37:40.606
Dir!

37:41.911 --> 37:43.043
Dir.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.439
I've brought you something.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.749
[grunting]

38:00.147 --> 38:02.497
Ah, we can't have you die now.

38:03.629 --> 38:06.849
No. Not when, someday,

38:06.893 --> 38:08.764
you might get free again.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.026
[grunting]

38:12.768 --> 38:14.204
Free?

38:15.902 --> 38:17.251
I want to be free.

38:17.991 --> 38:21.255
Do you mean it, Ivar, huh?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.953
You know, you used
to call me "the cripple."

38:24.954 --> 38:26.478
God forgive me!

38:28.828 --> 38:30.395
It's my last chance.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.963
I'm sick. Really sick.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.791
I won't last the winter.

38:35.835 --> 38:36.923
I know.

38:40.143 --> 38:42.581
So, what did you mean, huh?

38:42.624 --> 38:45.758
That one day
I might be free, huh?

38:45.801 --> 38:48.282
If you... If you help me,

38:48.326 --> 38:50.545
I can give you
everything you want.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.809
Everything?

38:53.853 --> 38:55.985
Everything and anything!

38:56.029 --> 38:58.945
Riches beyond belief!

38:58.988 --> 39:02.862
And slaves! Women!
Hundreds, thousands of slaves.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.039
Hundreds of women!

39:06.082 --> 39:08.476
Castles everywhere.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.351
I don't care too much
about the castles.

39:19.922 --> 39:23.012
I would just like the chance
to overthrow Prince Oleg.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.372
What is it?

39:36.896 --> 39:38.419
[Gunnhild] I had a dream.

39:38.463 --> 39:41.422
And in my dream,
I saw a village all ablaze.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.163
I saw women dying.

39:43.206 --> 39:44.947
A young boy pierced
by an arrow.

39:44.991 --> 39:46.558
High up in a tree.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.256
[Torvi] What do you
think it meant?

39:52.041 --> 39:52.912
I don't know.

39:52.955 --> 39:54.522
You must have some idea.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.395
I think it might have been...

39:59.092 --> 40:00.528
It might have been
Lagertha's village.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.096
Lagertha's?

40:03.139 --> 40:04.837
You mean, it was attacked?

40:04.880 --> 40:07.666
You have never been to
Lagertha's village, Gunnhild.

40:07.709 --> 40:08.884
No.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.147
But I had a feeling.

40:12.061 --> 40:13.976
My children are there!

40:14.020 --> 40:15.848
And why did I not see
or feel anything?

40:15.891 --> 40:17.502
I don't know, Torvi.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.329
I feel I should go there
and find out.

40:19.373 --> 40:22.115
You are with child.
Bjorn's child.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.682
It is a long way.

40:23.725 --> 40:24.944
I don't care.

40:25.988 --> 40:28.077
-Then I must go with you.
-No.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.644
No, I need you here.

40:29.688 --> 40:31.820
I will send someone
to discover the truth.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.607
I'm sure it is not
Lagertha's village.

40:36.608 --> 40:37.652
I would have heard.

40:37.696 --> 40:39.088
I'm going.

40:39.132 --> 40:40.786
Believe me,
I would like to go too.

40:40.829 --> 40:43.658
But I cannot leave Kattegat
for everyone's dreams.

40:43.702 --> 40:44.964
I have to be responsible.

40:45.007 --> 40:48.010
I'm trapped here
by responsibility.

40:48.054 --> 40:49.838
And, as my wife,
so are you.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.406
That is how it is.

41:02.024 --> 41:03.373
We mourn our dead,

41:05.158 --> 41:06.420
and honor them,

41:08.117 --> 41:09.989
and pray they will dwell
among the gods

41:10.032 --> 41:11.686
until Ragnarok.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.779
But we the living
must try and ensure that

41:17.823 --> 41:19.346
their deaths were not in vain.

41:21.304 --> 41:25.004
The bandits who attacked us
and killed them

41:25.047 --> 41:28.094
did not get what they wanted.

41:28.137 --> 41:32.011
They did not manage to steal
our grain or our livestock,

41:32.054 --> 41:34.404
which means that
they will come back.

41:34.448 --> 41:36.494
And I think they will
come back soon.

41:37.669 --> 41:38.757
We have a choice.

41:40.541 --> 41:43.065
We can abandon
our village and the dead.

41:44.110 --> 41:47.156
We can abandon our grain
and our livestock

41:47.200 --> 41:48.767
and we can go and hide
in the fields,

41:48.810 --> 41:51.030
and hope the bandits
don't find us.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.337
Or we can stay.

41:56.862 --> 42:00.387
We can send a few messengers
out to villages for help.

42:01.780 --> 42:05.000
And we can prepare
again to fight

42:05.044 --> 42:07.612
and defend what is ours.

42:10.484 --> 42:12.834
I don't want
to leave my brother.

42:15.141 --> 42:16.838
[Runa] I lost my son.

42:17.970 --> 42:20.363
You can all go if you want,

42:20.407 --> 42:22.757
but I will stay
and defend the dead.

42:23.976 --> 42:26.152
[Gudmund] We will all stay.

42:26.195 --> 42:29.198
Does a warrior hide
in the rushes

42:29.242 --> 42:31.549
because he is afraid of dying?

42:33.159 --> 42:34.682
None of us is afraid.

42:35.378 --> 42:37.119
Hali wasn't afraid.

42:38.425 --> 42:40.558
We should all stay and fight.

42:43.169 --> 42:45.258
[Lagertha] Hali wasn't afraid.

42:45.301 --> 42:46.912
He died for all of us.

42:51.307 --> 42:53.266
So all of us will stay here.

42:55.050 --> 42:56.878
Even if we have to die
for them.

43:00.055 --> 43:02.188
[indistinct chatter]

43:02.231 --> 43:03.406
[Torvi] Gunnhild!

43:04.190 --> 43:05.626
Gunnhild! Wait!

43:05.670 --> 43:06.801
Gunnhild!

43:08.629 --> 43:10.500
I still think
I should come with you.

43:10.544 --> 43:12.067
I'm sure Ubbe is right.

43:12.111 --> 43:14.113
It is not Lagertha's village.

43:14.156 --> 43:16.768
-I just need to--
-Give these to Hali and Asa.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.772
Tell them I love them.

43:22.164 --> 43:23.557
Of course I will.

43:24.340 --> 43:25.777
Now we must go.

43:42.707 --> 43:43.751
[King Olaf] Well?

43:44.970 --> 43:46.362
We agree to your plan.

43:47.363 --> 43:48.843
[panting] Send word out

43:48.887 --> 43:51.846
to all the kings and Jarls
to gather here.

43:51.890 --> 43:55.110
To elect Bjorn Ironside
King of all Norway!

43:55.154 --> 43:56.982
I already have.

43:57.025 --> 43:58.461
[cackling]

44:04.163 --> 44:06.295
[music playing]
