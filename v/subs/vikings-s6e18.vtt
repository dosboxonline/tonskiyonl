WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.603
[Ragnar]
Previously on Vikings...

00:02.636 --> 00:03.471
[Erik] Harald is gone.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.772
I make myself King.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.174
And you will be my Queen.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.842
I drive it into
the eye of Vigfadir.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.411
[Erik gasping]

00:10.444 --> 00:11.879
I'm blind.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.181
[Ivar] We must flush
the King out

00:13.214 --> 00:14.515
of his stronghold,
and force him

00:14.548 --> 00:16.117
to fight us at a place
of our choosing.

00:16.150 --> 00:19.287
Scouts tell us that
the Viking army is here.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.055
We should try
to engage it on our terms.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.690
[Ubbe] We should never have
left Kattegat!

00:22.723 --> 00:25.259
Why are we dying here?
In the middle of an ocean?

00:25.293 --> 00:28.196
King Alfred will be bound
to visit his strongholds
in the south.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.131
Wherever he goes,
we'll see him.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.599
We must evacuate here.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.201
Although it pains me
more than I can say.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.568
[Elsewith] I hope you are
proud of yourself.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.237
Leaving Wessex
without even a fight!

00:36.270 --> 00:38.739
It is only important
that Ivar does not capture me.

00:38.772 --> 00:39.607
Look.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.376
We made it.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.616
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:49.177 --> 01:51.145
[seagulls squawking]

02:55.576 --> 02:57.745
[squawking]

03:04.685 --> 03:05.619
[Othere] Fresh water.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.158
Here.

03:13.827 --> 03:14.662
And look!

03:15.896 --> 03:19.066
I've tasted them!
They're wonderful!

03:19.099 --> 03:21.369
-[laughing]
-I don't know what gods
brought us here.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.372
I don't know anything anymore.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.540
Just accept.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.043
[Othere] Torvi is right.

03:30.077 --> 03:33.481
We must accept the verdict
of my God and yours.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.717
And know that we were
brought here for a purpose.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.752
Which is?

03:40.854 --> 03:43.190
To be revealed, I would say.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.593
We're alive.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.462
It's enough.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.433
[sighs] For now.

04:01.141 --> 04:01.909
[sighs]

04:19.793 --> 04:23.096
[indistinct chatter]

04:23.130 --> 04:24.832
[horses whinnying]

04:28.302 --> 04:29.470
[Saxon captain] Ready!

04:40.848 --> 04:42.750
My gracious Lord King.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.686
We are well met, Bishop Aldulf.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.155
Let us face what
we have to face, together,

04:48.188 --> 04:50.858
thanking God for his many
mercies and enduring love.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.661
Amen.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.563
My Lady, my name
is Sister Annis.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.298
I'm here to assist you
and your son, with God's grace.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.000
Thank you, Sister.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.302
I've ordered some of
my best men to escort the Queen

05:02.336 --> 05:03.737
and the young Prince to safety.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.406
My Lord Bishop,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.508
nothing will prevent me
remaining beside the King,

05:07.541 --> 05:10.678
my husband,
nor sharing his dangers.

05:10.711 --> 05:14.348
But I thank you
for your kindness.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.718
Tell me, my Lord, just how
large is this Viking army?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.921
My Lord?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.022
-Come.
-[grunts]

05:22.055 --> 05:23.056
You should rest.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.626
I'm fine.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.128
[clears throat]

05:36.336 --> 05:39.373
You must have a great care
for yourself, husband.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.174
Or we both know
the consequences.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.778
You must stay strong,

05:44.812 --> 05:47.280
in your body and in your soul.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.550
If you feel a weakness
or weariness,

05:49.583 --> 05:51.919
then resist it.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.389
Resist the temptation
to fall easily into
a drowsy sickness.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.660
Stay strong.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.498
For me.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.703
For everyone gathered here...

06:12.239 --> 06:13.941
and for yourself.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.610
Do you understand?

06:18.712 --> 06:19.913
[Alfred] Yes, my love.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.451
I understand.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.488
My friends.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.157
Sons and daughters of Wessex.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.893
We stand indeed
at a crossroads.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.663
But just as spring
always triumphs over winter,

06:35.696 --> 06:37.898
so life will always triumph
over death.

06:39.366 --> 06:42.169
We must believe that.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.372
We know these Northmen
have a reputation
as savage warriors.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.408
But they are only human,
just like us.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.578
-[all] Yes.
-Cut them, and they bleed.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.080
There is nothing under heaven
to say that we cannot
vanquish them!

06:53.113 --> 06:55.749
-[all] Yes!
-Confronted by evil,

06:55.783 --> 06:57.384
we do not surrender to it.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.520
-[all cheering]
-Or fear it.

06:59.553 --> 07:03.390
-[all] No!
-We have the one thing
that the pagans do not have.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.392
We have the risen Christ
on our side.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.428
And with God on our side,
how is it even conceivable

07:08.462 --> 07:10.097
that we could lose
this final battle?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.232
[all cheering]

08:00.380 --> 08:02.015
So, we are at the crossroads.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.653
We can decide to move forward,

08:05.686 --> 08:07.755
engage the enemy,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.823
trust in ourselves
and in our God,

08:11.825 --> 08:14.695
or we can, fearing the worst...

08:16.496 --> 08:18.265
agree to negotiate with him.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.400
[all cheering]

08:21.969 --> 08:24.004
I have to tell you
that I no longer believe

08:24.037 --> 08:25.706
in negotiating with the Devil!

08:25.739 --> 08:27.608
[all cheering]

08:27.641 --> 08:30.010
We will travel to
our garrison at Chichester,

08:30.043 --> 08:32.179
and with the sea
at our back, we shall fight.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.681
It is the only way.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.182
[all cheer]

08:35.215 --> 08:37.517
Wessex will never return
to the Dark Ages!

08:37.551 --> 08:40.120
Wessex will be a beacon
for the rest of our country!

08:40.153 --> 08:41.521
A beacon of light!

08:41.555 --> 08:42.923
A beacon of liberty!

08:42.956 --> 08:46.293
We shall never surrender,
whatever the cost!

08:46.326 --> 08:47.795
[all cheering]

08:47.828 --> 08:50.297
That is my pledge to you!

08:50.330 --> 08:53.567
And I will lay down my body
in the earth to fulfill it.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.403
In this moment
are all our lives

08:56.436 --> 08:58.739
and all our history
bound up in one.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.507
This is our moment!

09:00.540 --> 09:02.375
-[all cheering]
-This is our time!

09:08.616 --> 09:12.485
God bless you all!
And God bless Wessex!

09:12.519 --> 09:15.222
[all] God bless Wessex!

09:15.255 --> 09:16.489
[Saxon captain] King Alfred!

09:19.627 --> 09:21.461
[seagulls squawking]

09:42.783 --> 09:44.251
[panting]

09:50.123 --> 09:52.225
[wolf howls in distance]

09:55.562 --> 09:57.631
[howling]

10:18.118 --> 10:19.552
[snarling]

10:39.773 --> 10:41.274
[eagle chirping]

11:25.786 --> 11:27.554
[laughs]

11:35.028 --> 11:37.230
[birds chirping]

12:00.553 --> 12:02.089
It's a new world.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.234
I wonder what else
it has to show us?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.384
[Viking] Make way, make way.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.554
[horn blowing]

12:39.392 --> 12:41.394
[laughs]

12:41.428 --> 12:44.664
I was just thinking
that King Harald may die
in the battle ahead.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.268
By whose hand, I don't know.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.407
Do you really so much
want to be King of all Norway?

12:57.677 --> 13:01.048
Well, wouldn't that make me
even more famous? Huh?

13:07.420 --> 13:08.555
You see, Hvitserk...

13:10.223 --> 13:12.159
nobody talks about
Ragnar anymore.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.595
They've already forgotten
who he was.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.299
That frightens me.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.769
Yes, they talk about me.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.238
And the Saxons talk about me.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.140
And the Rus.
And all along the Silk Road.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.175
But...

13:30.510 --> 13:31.611
it's not enough.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.351
[all cheering]

13:39.752 --> 13:43.123
One day, it's true, I will die.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.493
Hopefully in battle,

13:46.526 --> 13:49.329
and not like some drooling
old man! [chuckles]

13:50.730 --> 13:53.200
And Odin will welcome me
into Valhalla.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.403
But when they dig up my bones,

13:58.906 --> 14:00.207
I want them to say,

14:01.308 --> 14:02.709
"Here is the grave...

14:04.144 --> 14:07.314
of the most famous Viking
who ever lived."

14:14.154 --> 14:15.188
And do you know what?

14:17.124 --> 14:20.127
My son will become
a great warrior for the Rus.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.665
And so my son and his sons

14:25.698 --> 14:29.069
will ensure that
my bloodline endures

14:29.102 --> 14:32.072
and people a long way
in the future,

14:33.373 --> 14:36.076
hundreds of years from now,

14:36.109 --> 14:39.746
and probably from
all over the world...

14:39.779 --> 14:44.751
will be proud to find that
my blood is in their bodies...

14:46.319 --> 14:48.555
and my spirit
is in their souls.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.926
[laughing]

14:55.862 --> 14:57.030
What's so funny?

14:58.031 --> 14:59.566
Ah, nothing.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.435
Forgive me.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.906
You're probably right.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.708
Oh, you better believe it,
my brother.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.682
What?

15:15.715 --> 15:19.586
Your eyes have turned
deep blue, Ivar.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.191
You know what
that means, remember?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.692
We used to watch over you.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.396
We knew that when
your eyes turned blue...

15:31.064 --> 15:33.733
you were in great danger
of hurting yourself.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.172
And we would say,
"Not today, Ivar...

15:40.573 --> 15:41.741
not today."

15:56.389 --> 15:57.624
I remember.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.803
[laughing]

16:15.608 --> 16:16.809
[gasps]

16:20.580 --> 16:21.814
[sighs]

16:26.319 --> 16:27.854
[all howling]

16:37.730 --> 16:39.799
[all laughing]

16:57.650 --> 16:59.286
Gudrid, take Ragnar.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.159
[sighs softly]

17:22.742 --> 17:23.776
[Ubbe] Torvi!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.849
Look what we have found!

17:29.882 --> 17:32.385
There is so much game,
so many animals,

17:32.419 --> 17:34.621
so much just to eat,
I can't even describe it!

17:34.654 --> 17:36.022
Words fail me.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.691
Words are never enough.
Here is paradise!

17:38.725 --> 17:40.560
We must make a sacrifice, Ubbe.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.363
We must thank
the gods for all this bounty.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.564
-We shall.
-Mmm.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.037
[Torvi speaking Old Norse]

19:01.908 --> 19:06.779
I wonder if the gods are truly
here in this new world.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.483
Perhaps they are.

19:10.517 --> 19:14.153
But, even so, perhaps in
a different shape.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.190
That is a strange idea.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.528
Perhaps even terrifying.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.497
[sniffs] What?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.699
Did you come all this way
just to find the familiar,

19:26.733 --> 19:28.535
Ubbe, son of Ragnar?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.038
That's shameful.

19:34.073 --> 19:37.510
Maybe you are not so much
like your father after all.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.349
How would you know?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.719
[birds chirping]

20:21.153 --> 20:22.589
[breathing heavily]

20:46.178 --> 20:48.014
[rustling]

21:22.715 --> 21:24.917
[Othere] The carvings
look recent.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.919
And I found some
footsteps over there,

21:26.953 --> 21:29.756
and what looks like a path.
But it runs out.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.991
-[Viking 1] A path down here.
-[Viking 2] Not alone.

21:32.892 --> 21:33.793
What shall we do?

21:33.826 --> 21:34.794
[woman] What could it be?

21:38.698 --> 21:40.333
I think we should leave
some gifts here

21:40.367 --> 21:41.668
for whoever made the carving.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.303
And see what happens.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.874
Do you think
they know we're here?

21:48.541 --> 21:50.443
Yes.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.811
I think they know.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.305
[men laughing]

22:53.339 --> 22:54.674
[Viking 1] He's having
a piss again.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.309
What's the matter
with him?

22:57.343 --> 22:59.746
He drinks more
than all of us put together.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.250
Come here, boy!

23:08.588 --> 23:10.857
Hello, Ancient One.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.064
You tried to kill me
many years ago,

23:18.097 --> 23:19.632
Ivar, the Boneless.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.970
You see how futile
were your efforts?

23:25.938 --> 23:29.576
There is something reassuring
about your immortality.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.011
[chuckles]

23:32.044 --> 23:35.848
If I were you,
I would never wish
to be in my state.

23:35.882 --> 23:39.986
Neither living nor dead,
cold or warm,

23:40.019 --> 23:45.224
fetid with the earth,
witnessing only horrors.

23:45.257 --> 23:49.261
Death would be
a blessed relief.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.134
What about me?

23:55.167 --> 24:00.907
Yes. You always come
to the point.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.211
I admire you,
although you are foolish.

24:05.244 --> 24:08.715
What happens to me?
Do you know? Have you seen it?

24:08.748 --> 24:11.183
I've always known your fate.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.586
I have fore-suffered it.

24:13.620 --> 24:17.790
It is written in runes
and in the stars.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.259
What is it?

24:20.292 --> 24:23.129
[Seer] In some ways
it will not surprise you.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.899
Then tell me.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.568
If I told you,

24:28.601 --> 24:33.806
you would have to try
and evade it, escape it.

24:33.840 --> 24:38.444
You would go anywhere
not to meet your fate.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.313
But you would still meet it.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.783
There's no escape.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.854
And no need to know,
Ivar, the Boneless.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.960
[exhales]

24:59.832 --> 25:03.302
All my life...
I never truly believed you.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.540
You don't have
to believe me now.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.046
I think I want to.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.351
[grunts]

25:24.624 --> 25:27.126
[indistinct chattering]

25:33.399 --> 25:34.266
[horn blowing]

25:40.439 --> 25:41.407
Are we here?

25:41.440 --> 25:42.441
Yes.

25:44.510 --> 25:45.712
Here's your chair.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.353
We welcome you,

25:54.386 --> 25:56.455
you earls, captains,
and jarls of the city

25:56.488 --> 25:58.891
and outer reaches of Kattegat,

25:58.925 --> 26:02.561
and wish blessings of Odin
upon you and your Council.

26:02.595 --> 26:04.931
Perhaps at this point,
King Erik will speak to you.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.401
[clears throat]

26:12.605 --> 26:13.973
I am blind.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.209
I do not know why.

26:18.611 --> 26:21.180
Perhaps only the gods know.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.918
With Harald Finehair gone,

26:25.952 --> 26:27.920
I am your King.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.691
And there is much to be done.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.894
We must maintain our defenses

26:34.927 --> 26:36.763
against a possible attack
by the Rus.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.033
And build new ramparts
to protect ourselves

26:41.067 --> 26:44.103
from attacks by our own people!

26:44.136 --> 26:47.606
We have been told that
taxes must be raised.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.842
-[all murmuring in agreement]
-Is it true?

26:52.478 --> 26:54.681
-I--
-[Ingrid] Of course they have
to be raised.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.383
How else can we build
miles and miles
of new stone ramparts,

26:57.416 --> 26:59.418
and a fort at each end?

26:59.451 --> 27:02.054
Only a fool would think
they could be built
without cost!

27:05.324 --> 27:08.728
My Lord King,
if indeed you are King.

27:08.761 --> 27:12.431
Will you not suspend
these expenses as we ask?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.300
We see no reason for them.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.835
[murmuring]

27:17.937 --> 27:18.971
My Lord...

27:20.539 --> 27:24.443
you would dare to question
the judgment

27:24.476 --> 27:27.613
of the wife of
King Harald Finehair,

27:27.646 --> 27:29.916
the true King of Kattegat,

27:29.949 --> 27:31.650
my Lord and yours?

27:32.518 --> 27:34.120
I will not challenge it!

27:37.323 --> 27:40.693
Just yesterday, I received
some disturbing news.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.831
A ship entered our harbor.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.166
It carried with it
several Danes.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.035
They say a Christian missionary

27:49.068 --> 27:52.504
arrived in their kingdom
and was allowed to stay,

27:52.538 --> 27:54.506
against the better judgment
of everyone...

27:55.808 --> 27:56.976
except their King.

27:58.444 --> 28:02.181
It seems this King
listened to this Christian...

28:04.050 --> 28:05.718
and agreed to be converted.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.821
He was baptized

28:08.855 --> 28:12.191
and has declared that his
is now a Christian kingdom,

28:12.224 --> 28:15.194
and that his people must
no longer worship the old gods.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.199
Perhaps this is nothing.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.169
Perhaps the good people

28:23.202 --> 28:24.904
will kill both
the Christian missionary

28:25.838 --> 28:27.573
and their foolish King.

28:27.606 --> 28:30.642
Or perhaps this is
a sign of the future.

28:30.676 --> 28:32.178
Now do you see
why we must build

28:32.211 --> 28:34.046
new walls around Kattegat?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.015
Now will you agree
to pay your taxes?

28:43.155 --> 28:44.523
Those of you who agree,
say "Aye."

28:50.229 --> 28:51.697
Aye.

28:51.730 --> 28:57.003
[nobles] Aye. Aye. Aye.
Aye. Aye. Aye.

29:00.539 --> 29:01.640
[exclaims]

29:03.309 --> 29:04.743
[Erik] You did this to me.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.917
I do not know how.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.284
But you are a witch.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.222
This is your doing.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.091
You chose your path.
That wasn't me.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.527
All your past history.

29:22.628 --> 29:23.762
That wasn't me.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.899
It was the gods
who blinded you.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.768
Don't you understand?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.672
[scoffs]

29:35.474 --> 29:37.009
I understand.

29:39.711 --> 29:41.247
You need sleep.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.949
You have many responsibilities.

29:45.751 --> 29:48.120
[breathing heavily]

29:48.154 --> 29:50.957
Thank you, Ingrid.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.206
[sighs]

30:15.982 --> 30:17.183
[Naad] Ubbe!

30:21.520 --> 30:22.521
What is wrong?

30:26.292 --> 30:27.927
Well, what is it?

30:31.630 --> 30:34.133
They've taken our gifts
and replaced them
with new ones.

31:08.734 --> 31:09.701
Look!

31:11.503 --> 31:13.005
[rustling]

31:50.342 --> 31:52.078
[Saxon captain]
Keep the line.

31:56.582 --> 31:57.883
Keep moving!

31:59.851 --> 32:01.287
Bear right!

32:02.754 --> 32:03.555
[groans]

32:05.591 --> 32:06.425
[groans]

32:08.794 --> 32:09.928
Halt!

32:09.962 --> 32:11.397
[Aldulf] My Lord.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.271
Help him.

32:19.305 --> 32:20.839
For the love of God,
take care of him!

32:33.452 --> 32:36.022
[Elsewith] This has happened
many times in the King's life.

32:36.055 --> 32:39.458
Nobody knows the cause,
or the remedy.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.194
But we need the King now
more than ever.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.596
My sister in Christ,
we all know that.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.600
But what can we do?

32:48.634 --> 32:51.403
Let's you and I watch
over him tonight,

32:51.437 --> 32:54.640
and pray for him,
and pray for Wessex.

32:58.444 --> 32:59.278
[Hvitserk] Ivar!

33:02.381 --> 33:04.183
Ivar, you have to see this.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.286
What is it?

33:19.798 --> 33:23.335
If they come now,
we shall miss them.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.937
It will be days,
perhaps even weeks,
before they get here.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.374
[chuckles]
How can you be so sure?

33:31.843 --> 33:34.980
Either way, whenever they come,

33:35.013 --> 33:36.782
they'll have to pass through
those trees.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.518
And when they do...

33:40.952 --> 33:42.288
we'll be waiting for them.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.826
[grunts]

33:51.897 --> 33:54.833
[animal screeching]

34:13.652 --> 34:16.155
[inhales, exhales]

34:27.733 --> 34:30.436
[animal screeching]

34:34.473 --> 34:35.941
Skraelings.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.815
[Torvi] What are we to do?

34:43.849 --> 34:47.186
[Othere] We should follow
the trail from the carvings.

34:47.219 --> 34:50.088
It disappeared, but perhaps
we can pick it up again.

34:50.122 --> 34:51.290
[Ubbe] I agree.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.092
We can't just sit around here

34:54.126 --> 34:56.662
waiting for something
to happen.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.431
Whoever they are,
these skraelings left us gifts,

34:59.465 --> 35:01.467
they haven't attacked us.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.636
Perhaps they are just as
curious and as uncertain
as we are, hmm?

35:05.571 --> 35:07.439
Hmm.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.508
But if they do attack us,
it's better than sitting here.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.111
Are we all agreed?

35:14.480 --> 35:17.183
-Yes.
-[others] Yes.

35:17.216 --> 35:20.452
Well. We should
start straight away.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.798
[door creaking]

36:06.832 --> 36:07.866
Slave?

36:12.738 --> 36:13.939
Yes?

36:13.972 --> 36:15.241
Come.

36:15.274 --> 36:16.174
Come closer.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.518
Tell me...

36:29.120 --> 36:30.989
how would you like to be free?

36:32.524 --> 36:33.359
Huh?

36:38.163 --> 36:39.898
Why are you saying this to me?

36:40.666 --> 36:41.967
I'm afraid.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.735
[Erik] No, no, sit.

36:43.769 --> 36:44.770
Come.

36:50.342 --> 36:53.745
You have not answered
my question.

36:55.247 --> 36:58.484
Would you like
to be a free man?

37:02.821 --> 37:05.090
There is something
you can do for me.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.193
And once you have done it...

37:09.928 --> 37:11.430
you will be free.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.276
[indistinct chatter]

37:27.078 --> 37:30.716
[praying in Latin]

37:40.392 --> 37:41.560
Elsewith?

37:43.862 --> 37:45.063
You are awake.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.767
[Sister Annis]
This is the Lord's doing.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.869
My Lord King, I would freely
have given up my life
for yours,

37:50.902 --> 37:52.270
if God had asked me.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.639
Thank you.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.073
[Elsewith] How are you feeling?

37:58.810 --> 37:59.645
[groans]

38:02.113 --> 38:03.915
[groans] I am well enough.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.117
-Wait. I will fetch
the servants to help you.
-[groaning]

38:07.819 --> 38:08.920
Sister.

38:11.222 --> 38:12.290
[gasps]

38:16.995 --> 38:19.398
[indistinct chatter]

38:23.702 --> 38:26.137
[grunting, exclaiming in pain]

38:28.907 --> 38:30.141
[Ivar] Wait, wait, wait.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.646
[grunting]

38:46.358 --> 38:48.259
[grunting] I'm all right.

38:48.293 --> 38:49.495
I'm all right.

38:59.237 --> 39:00.639
[groans]

39:04.209 --> 39:06.344
Your eyes are very blue, Ivar.
You should rest.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.359
[Hvitserk] Ivar.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.540
I know how to do it.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.477
Huh?

39:38.510 --> 39:39.678
I know how to win.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.586
What are you going to do?

39:50.722 --> 39:52.491
I'm going to cripple them.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.162
[people coughing]

39:58.597 --> 39:59.431
[servant] Come with me.

40:12.911 --> 40:13.745
Well,

40:14.713 --> 40:17.616
do you want to be free?

40:19.718 --> 40:22.921
-[stammers] Yes.
-Ah.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.856
[stammers] What do you
want me to do?

40:27.392 --> 40:33.364
I want you to kill Ingrid.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.736
Will you do that for me,
my friend?

41:15.173 --> 41:16.141
We're close.

41:16.842 --> 41:17.909
Close?

41:18.644 --> 41:20.646
Yes.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.649
To something.
I don't know what.

41:25.450 --> 41:26.785
But we're very close.

41:27.953 --> 41:28.920
To them?

41:57.382 --> 41:59.484
[animals howling]

42:02.954 --> 42:03.989
We're here.

42:45.063 --> 42:48.199
[gasps] Nobody is here. Nobody.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.035
They knew.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.436
Oh, yes.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.439
They've known all the time.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.541
This is a game.

42:57.609 --> 42:58.576
A game?

42:59.911 --> 43:02.147
[Othere] A game
of life and death.

43:20.231 --> 43:22.133
[breath trembling]

43:23.568 --> 43:25.136
[all gasping]

43:42.654 --> 43:44.656
[music playing]
