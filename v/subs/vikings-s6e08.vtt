["If I Had A Heart" playing]

00:51.268 --> 00:53.270
[clamoring]

00:58.580 --> 01:00.756
[cheers and jeers]

01:04.281 --> 01:05.891
[clamor ceases]

01:11.941 --> 01:15.162
I wonder
if you even know,
brother,

01:15.205 --> 01:16.467
why you have been
brought here?

01:18.165 --> 01:21.690
-Yes
-Louder. I can't hear you.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.260
[softly] I know why.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.045
I killed Lagertha.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.134
What?

01:31.178 --> 01:33.005
I killed your mother, Bjorn.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.137
Ah!

01:34.181 --> 01:35.617
[indistinct whispers]

01:47.194 --> 01:49.196
Why?

01:49.239 --> 01:51.198
I thought she was Ivar.
I thought that she--

01:55.506 --> 01:57.334
I thought that Ivar
was coming to kill me.

01:58.596 --> 01:59.815
[indistinct whispers]

02:02.426 --> 02:04.515
I don't care what you thought!

02:04.559 --> 02:07.388
Being drunk is no excuse
for anything!

02:08.606 --> 02:11.305
You murdered my mother!

02:11.348 --> 02:15.613
You murdered the most famous
shield-maiden in the world!

02:17.354 --> 02:18.834
You!

02:18.877 --> 02:23.143
You sad, pathetic,
raddled little man.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.364
You were not fit
to kiss her feet!

02:29.279 --> 02:33.196
And you aren't fit
to be called a son of Ragnar.

02:34.371 --> 02:35.372
I--

02:36.852 --> 02:38.462
[panting]

02:43.772 --> 02:48.342
And when you killed my mother,
you killed a part of me too.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.172
And you have to understand...

02:56.088 --> 02:57.568
[whispers] I can never
forgive you.

03:04.619 --> 03:05.663
[Hvitserk] I know that.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.407
And you're right, Bjorn.

03:11.452 --> 03:14.585
I am a sad wreck of a man.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.457
I've made
a bad job of my life.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.591
And whatever
you want to do with me,

03:24.291 --> 03:26.206
even if you want
to burn me alive,

03:29.165 --> 03:30.253
I'll accept it.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.343
For I've deserved it.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.348
Unlike you and Ubbe,

03:38.392 --> 03:41.395
I've never done anything
to make our father proud of me.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.314
Hvitserk is guilty!

03:48.750 --> 03:50.447
You all heard him confess!

03:51.143 --> 03:52.275
[scoffs]

04:05.636 --> 04:09.161
I will decide tomorrow
what punishment he must face.

04:12.034 --> 04:13.253
Take him away.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.343
[crowd clamoring]

04:31.749 --> 04:34.491
I am so sorry
that it has come to this.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.667
Don't be sorry.
We are who we are.

04:39.496 --> 04:42.325
Perhaps you can still
throw yourself
on Bjorn's mercy.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.413
Ask for forgiveness.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.545
Forgiveness?

04:48.592 --> 04:50.464
Don't you realize, Ubbe,

04:50.507 --> 04:53.205
I did what we all agreed
should be done?

04:53.249 --> 04:54.946
I killed Lagertha.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.123
I killed the woman
who murdered our mother.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.561
You said the gods
would arrange our revenge.

05:00.604 --> 05:01.649
I remember that.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.565
You yourself
attacked Lagertha,

05:04.608 --> 05:06.349
tried to kill her.

05:06.393 --> 05:09.570
But you could see
it wasn't what the gods
had in mind.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.137
Ivar, Ivar, who is supposed
to be so clever,

05:13.443 --> 05:15.271
promised to kill Lagertha.

05:16.577 --> 05:17.839
But he also failed.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.712
So, it was up to me.

05:23.410 --> 05:26.151
Don't you see, Ubbe?

05:27.588 --> 05:30.286
I was an instrument
of the gods.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.767
It was my fate.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.552
It was me.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.442
I want to kill him.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.360
You have every right.
I can't deny it.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.407
But neither does he.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.062
[Amma] He was not
in his right mind
when he killed your mother.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.586
It was not really
Hvitserk who killed her.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.762
Don't talk about
the drug addict.

06:11.806 --> 06:14.069
Talk about my mother's village,
what happened there!

06:15.331 --> 06:16.419
Talk about my son.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.204
Talk about our son!

06:21.337 --> 06:24.296
Your son wanted to play a part
in the defense of his village.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.299
I should have been there.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.824
He wanted to prove
himself as a warrior.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.740
He knew that his mother
and his father would hear
of his exploits.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.829
He put himself in danger.

06:34.872 --> 06:38.136
Yes. He had quite
extraordinary courage.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.620
And now the gods punish me.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.756
I have lost three things,

06:48.799 --> 06:54.457
my mother, my son,
and now the crown of Norway.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.070
These are
hard things to bear.

-[knife clatters]

07:07.252 --> 07:08.384

07:17.132 --> 07:18.829
We will burn
Hvitserk tomorrow.

07:44.768 --> 07:45.856
[door opens]

07:45.900 --> 07:47.641
[sighs]

07:47.684 --> 07:48.642
[door closes]

07:54.604 --> 07:55.605
I'm disturbing you?

07:57.302 --> 07:58.347
No.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.392
Come sit, Erik.

08:14.798 --> 08:15.973
I owe you my life.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.105
[scoffs] No.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.021
No, the gods spared you.

08:23.677 --> 08:26.984
Every Viking, from [inhales]
whichever country we came from,

08:27.028 --> 08:32.337
all heard tell
of the saga of Ragnar Lothbrok
and his sons.

08:32.381 --> 08:36.211
All the Great Halls
of Scandinavia,
poets sang of Ragnar,

08:37.342 --> 08:38.474
and of you,

08:39.606 --> 08:40.998
Bjorn Ironside.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.437
So, it is strange

08:47.048 --> 08:50.355
to be here now
sitting beside you,

08:51.748 --> 08:53.489
as if you were
like the rest of us.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.363
And, like the rest of us,

09:00.278 --> 09:01.541
mourning your dead.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.198
I am going to

09:08.156 --> 09:11.942
burn my brother tomorrow.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.515
I want him to feel
unimaginable pain.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.390
Because that is what I feel.

09:36.619 --> 09:37.794
[pats shoulder]

09:39.970 --> 09:41.755
[footsteps recede]

09:47.064 --> 09:48.326
[Ragnar] And what does
a man do?

09:49.327 --> 09:50.938
[Young Bjorn] He fights.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.810
-[Ragnar] And?
-He looks after his family.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.858
[Floki] You have your
father's eyes.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.035
[Ragnar] When your time comes,

10:01.078 --> 10:03.907
you must lead with your head,
not with your heart.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.518
Can you do that?

10:08.869 --> 10:10.348
I don't want you to go.

10:12.699 --> 10:13.700
It's fate.

10:19.836 --> 10:20.924
[panting]

10:26.713 --> 10:27.888
I've changed my mind.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.151
I'm coming with you.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.295
[Ragnar] Look after
your mother.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.041
Come on.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.000
[grunts]

10:56.743 --> 10:57.700
Move on.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.356
[sighs]

11:17.328 --> 11:18.329
[sighs]

11:27.904 --> 11:29.732
[vocalizing]

12:46.243 --> 12:47.244
[gasps]

13:07.047 --> 13:08.396
Light the fire!

13:13.531 --> 13:14.837
[grunts]

13:25.413 --> 13:26.631
[sobbing softly]

13:50.003 --> 13:55.312
[god-like voice
speaking Old Norse]

14:27.997 --> 14:28.955
[woman gasps]

14:34.395 --> 14:35.875
[Viking 1] What is he doing?

14:41.358 --> 14:42.751
[Viking 2] What have they done?

14:52.195 --> 14:52.935
[grunts]

14:57.331 --> 14:59.594
I saved you.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.292
And do you want to know
why I saved you?

15:02.336 --> 15:05.948
Because I know
you were happy to die.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.820
Perhaps you thought
the gods would admire
your courage

15:08.864 --> 15:10.387
and admit you into Valhalla.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.565
But I don't want you
to be happy.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.873
No. I don't want you to enter
Odin's Hall.

15:19.222 --> 15:22.095
I want you to suffer
a living death,

15:22.138 --> 15:25.576
expelled from Kattegat
and the haunts of men,

15:25.620 --> 15:29.493
destined to die in a ditch
in some forest somewhere,

15:29.537 --> 15:33.933
utterly forgotten, wretched,
insignificant, unmemorable!

15:37.240 --> 15:39.416
Like a flea
on a sheep's back.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.637
[spits]

15:44.595 --> 15:45.640
Take him away!

15:47.598 --> 15:48.643
[grunts]

15:56.390 --> 15:57.957
He won't survive
the winter.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.226
[panting]

16:06.269 --> 16:07.009
[Viking grunts]

16:19.065 --> 16:21.154
[Bjorn] People of Kattegat!

16:21.197 --> 16:22.851
I suffered
an immense defeat.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.986
King Harald Finehair
has defeated me

16:27.029 --> 16:29.379
in the election
for the kingship of Norway.

16:30.902 --> 16:31.903
Perhaps I

16:33.209 --> 16:36.560
underestimated my opponent.

16:36.604 --> 16:41.565
Whatever the case,
King Harald Finehair
is now King of Norway.

16:41.609 --> 16:45.047
And we are isolated,
vulnerable and alone.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.183
I fear he will launch
an attack very soon,

16:50.226 --> 16:52.054
as we are a prize
worth taking.

16:55.710 --> 16:56.885
Knowing what you know,

16:58.800 --> 17:00.628
do you want me
to step down as your king?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.503
If you do, you can pledge
your allegiance to King Harald

17:08.114 --> 17:09.767
and save Kattegat
from destruction.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.270
I am ashamed!

17:36.359 --> 17:39.884
Here is the son
of Ragnar Lothbrok
asking for your support.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.452
You know Bjorn.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.107
You know
what he has achieved.

17:45.151 --> 17:48.110
And now he tells you
that perhaps the gods
don't favor him anymore.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.374
But I don't think so.

17:53.159 --> 17:56.031
I think the gods
love Bjorn Ironside.

17:56.771 --> 17:57.772
As I do.

17:58.773 --> 17:59.948
As you do.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.082
You love Bjorn.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.694
And you have every reason
to do so.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.523
You should acclaim him.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.699
What other kind of hero
do you want?

18:13.179 --> 18:16.617
Here is Bjorn Ironside!
He fights for you!

18:17.270 --> 18:19.968
[cheering]

18:20.011 --> 18:22.144
All hail King Bjorn!

18:22.188 --> 18:24.494
[crowd] All hail King Bjorn!
All hail King Bjorn!

18:24.538 --> 18:28.019
All hail King Bjorn!
All hail King Bjorn!

18:28.063 --> 18:30.370
All hail King Bjorn!

18:30.413 --> 18:33.112
All hail King Bjorn!
All hail King Bjorn!

18:33.155 --> 18:35.984
All hail King Bjorn!

18:36.027 --> 18:38.029
All hail King Bjorn!

18:39.205 --> 18:41.468
All hail King Bjorn!

18:41.511 --> 18:44.123
All hail King Bjorn!

18:44.166 --> 18:47.387
All hail King Bjorn!

18:47.430 --> 18:49.171
All hail King Bjorn!

18:49.215 --> 18:51.826
All hail King Bjorn!

18:51.869 --> 18:54.524
All hail King Bjorn!

18:54.568 --> 18:57.136
All hail King Bjorn!

18:57.179 --> 18:59.138
[dramatic music playing]

19:11.889 --> 19:14.196
[indistinct chatter]

19:14.240 --> 19:15.806
[Igor] Where are we going?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.852
[Ivar] We're going
to see Uncle Oleg.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.201
[Igor] About what?

19:19.245 --> 19:21.856
I don't know.
Oleg is an enigma.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.251
What's an "igma"?

19:25.294 --> 19:26.861
Enigma.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.689
-What's an "enigma"?
-[chuckles]

19:30.908 --> 19:32.040
I've no idea.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.263
Perhaps Uncle Oleg
wants to give me a present.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.395
Perhaps he does.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.225
Perhaps he wants to give me
half of the sky.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.886
He cannot give you something
that is already yours.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.020
Remember that.
Huh?

19:59.502 --> 20:01.069
[indistinct chatter]

20:04.290 --> 20:06.292
[light folk music playing]

20:11.514 --> 20:12.472
[Katia] Prince Igor.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.866
And Ivar the Boneless.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.565
How very lovely.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.131
Will you have some tea?

20:20.175 --> 20:21.829
-Tea?
-[Katia] Tea.

20:22.612 --> 20:23.874
What is that?

20:23.918 --> 20:26.094
A plant. From Asia.

20:29.489 --> 20:30.490
[sighs]

20:33.101 --> 20:35.843
Medicine, perhaps.
[chuckles]

20:35.886 --> 20:38.280
I thought you might
be interested
in the further plans

20:38.324 --> 20:40.935
for the invasion
of your countries.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.677
I mean, of course,
our countries.

20:46.723 --> 20:47.724
Hmm.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.946
Of course.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.644
As you know,
we cannot put our plan

20:54.688 --> 20:58.126
into operation
until next spring.

20:58.169 --> 21:01.521
However, it seems to me
it would be ill-advised

21:01.564 --> 21:04.263
to commit such huge forces
into many unknown

21:05.568 --> 21:07.483
theaters of war.

21:07.527 --> 21:12.445
I know you can advise us
on what we are likely
to encounter,

21:12.488 --> 21:16.623
but I feel as if I need
to have a more current

21:16.666 --> 21:19.887
and a much
broader knowledge

21:19.930 --> 21:22.019
of those places
and countries...

21:22.803 --> 21:25.327
[chatters playfully]

21:27.329 --> 21:28.939
...we plan to attack.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.638
Strategy and planning
are everything.

21:31.681 --> 21:34.771
The mind is a far better
warrior than the sword.

21:34.815 --> 21:38.732
My intention is to send
small raiding parties.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.342
To take prisoners

21:40.386 --> 21:45.129
from whom further
vital information
can be gleaned.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.567
[Ivar] I agree,
that is very sensible,

21:47.610 --> 21:49.569
and I hope
you might consider

21:49.612 --> 21:51.832
appointing me to lead
one of the raiding parties.

21:55.966 --> 21:58.360
I will definitely consider
your request.

22:00.623 --> 22:06.368
Although Katia and I
both value your
intimate company.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.545
[Katia] You're a very
intriguing man, Ivar.

22:09.589 --> 22:12.026
Some of the things you say
surprise me,

22:12.069 --> 22:15.029
and I never know
what you will say next.

22:15.072 --> 22:18.424
You claim that there is
a connection between us,

22:18.467 --> 22:20.513
which I cannot
fully understand.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.386
[banging]

22:29.435 --> 22:30.958
What do you say,
Prince Igor?

22:31.001 --> 22:33.613
Would you like to come
with me on a raiding party?

22:33.656 --> 22:36.790
I must consult the king.
He knows everything.

22:36.833 --> 22:37.878
Mmm.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.012
What do you think?

22:42.056 --> 22:44.406
[deep voice] I think you should
make your own decisions!

22:44.450 --> 22:47.104
-[thumps]
-What are you doing? Huh!

22:49.324 --> 22:50.543
Are you crazy?

22:50.586 --> 22:51.413
[grunts]

22:51.457 --> 22:53.067
I am not crazy!

22:53.110 --> 22:56.418
I am the king here!
I own everything!

22:56.462 --> 22:59.595
This table! This room!
This palace!

22:59.639 --> 23:01.467
I own the whole country!

23:01.510 --> 23:03.556
I own the land
and the sky!

23:03.599 --> 23:04.905
[screams]

23:06.646 --> 23:08.604
[grunting]

23:19.485 --> 23:20.964
Don't do that anymore!

23:21.008 --> 23:23.489
Don't be stupid.
You are not a king.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.187
You are my ward.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.493
I am responsible for you.

23:27.536 --> 23:30.278
And without me,
you are nothing.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.627
Less than nothing.

23:31.671 --> 23:32.846
Do you understand?

23:34.717 --> 23:37.807
Don't ever try
to make fun of me again,

23:37.851 --> 23:42.464
or I'll cut out your tongue
and feed your liver to my dogs.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.075
[sobs]

23:45.119 --> 23:46.120
[gasps]

23:54.650 --> 23:55.869
[exhales]

23:56.652 --> 23:57.653
He's a good boy.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.746
He just needs
to be controlled.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.358
[sighs]

24:07.402 --> 24:11.537
You had a child once,
didn't you, Ivar?

24:19.719 --> 24:20.763
[grunts]

24:24.114 --> 24:26.377
Forgive me.
I've had enough to eat.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.315
[Igor crying]

24:56.669 --> 24:59.323
[Ivar] Do not weep, dear Igor.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.110
Sweet child, do not weep.

25:05.634 --> 25:06.722
I am here now.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.001
[Ubbe] Are you awake?

25:27.351 --> 25:29.440
Of course.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.486
Who wants to sleep
one's life away?

25:32.008 --> 25:33.140
[grunts]

25:34.794 --> 25:36.578
It is winter.

25:36.622 --> 25:40.147
So we should not set sail,
but we will.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.193
I want to go to Iceland.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.633
It is my destiny,

25:47.676 --> 25:49.286
so nothing should happen
to us on the way.

25:50.679 --> 25:51.680
Us?

25:53.116 --> 25:54.335
You are coming with me.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.600
I want you to arrange a meeting
with the wanderer, Othere.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.779
And I want to search
for Floki.

26:05.389 --> 26:06.608
You can search
all you want.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.830
You won't find him.

26:10.873 --> 26:14.224
Does that mean
that you refuse
to come with me?

26:14.268 --> 26:17.750
On the contrary.
I want nothing more.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.752
The settlers will wonder
what has happened to me,

26:19.795 --> 26:21.754
for I have been
gone so long.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.190
They will need reassurance.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.235
And Othere?

26:25.975 --> 26:26.976
You will meet him.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.548
How soon can you travel?

26:34.767 --> 26:35.985
In my head, Ubbe,

26:37.073 --> 26:38.814
[sighs]

26:38.858 --> 26:40.250
I am already there.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.888
[sighs]

27:08.931 --> 27:11.238
I haven't talked about my role
in the death of your mother.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.850
Your role?

27:14.894 --> 27:16.852
You left me in charge
of Kattegat.

27:16.896 --> 27:19.681
I knew about
Hvitserk's condition.

27:19.725 --> 27:25.556
I ought to have known that
he was dangerous but I ignored
all the warning signs.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.559
I knew nothing of Lagertha's
battle with the bandits.

27:28.603 --> 27:30.387
I knew nothing of her return.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.564
What a poor ruler I was.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.698
I blame myself.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.094
Where was I when she needed me?

27:43.836 --> 27:45.185
Searching for glory.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.892
[indistinct chatter]

28:09.644 --> 28:10.732
[Bjorn] I can't
do this anymore.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.171
I love my wife.
It is not fair to her.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.959
That is not you
talking, Bjorn.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.743
Those are just some words
you have rehearsed.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.576
Look inside yourself.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.364
I have made
so many mistakes.

28:38.586 --> 28:39.805
I don't want to lie
to Gunnhild.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.110
She doesn't deserve it.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.679
Don't you think
Gunnhild knows?

28:46.463 --> 28:47.638
Of course she knows.

28:57.648 --> 29:00.086
How long have we
on this earth,

29:00.129 --> 29:03.176
that we should deny ourselves
what we most want and desire?

29:04.830 --> 29:06.614
You know you
want to be with me.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.967
You know you cannot
escape my desire.

29:19.583 --> 29:20.628
Nor want to.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.212
[Ingrid gasps]

29:39.255 --> 29:40.474
[Bjorn gasps]

30:16.118 --> 30:17.337
[gasps]

30:21.776 --> 30:23.038
I just needed to know.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.484
Olaf, my dearest friend.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.487
Where are your
warriors going?

30:38.924 --> 30:40.577
To patrol our borders.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.972
Please sit down.
Get him a chair.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.759
It cannot be a surprise
to you that

30:48.803 --> 30:53.199
I don't altogether trust
the other kings
to accept my rule.

30:53.242 --> 30:57.116
Who could ever really trust
Thorkell the Tall? Huh?

30:57.159 --> 31:00.206
He has betrayed
everyone in the past,
even his own sons.

31:00.249 --> 31:05.124
Then your election
was an empty victory.
[chuckles]

31:05.167 --> 31:06.908
[Harald chuckles]

31:06.952 --> 31:07.953
On the contrary.

31:10.259 --> 31:12.958
Many of the other kings
have already submitted
to my rule.

31:14.176 --> 31:16.004
Of course,
what I need now

31:16.048 --> 31:18.485
is to find an example
of someone who hasn't,

31:19.747 --> 31:21.053
and bring them to heel.

31:22.837 --> 31:25.144
Thorkell, for example.

31:25.187 --> 31:29.365
I rather hope that he tests
and pushes against
our boundaries.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.237
In which case,
I can teach him a lesson,

31:31.280 --> 31:33.543
for the common good,
of course. [laughs]

31:33.587 --> 31:35.110
And Bjorn?

31:40.724 --> 31:41.987
Bjorn is different.

31:43.945 --> 31:47.818
He is a very
special person.

31:49.777 --> 31:50.952
When I finally kill him

31:53.346 --> 31:57.176
is when I am truly
King of all Norway.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.960
And what about me?

31:59.004 --> 32:01.136
I serve
no purpose anymore.

32:01.180 --> 32:06.011
I have no kingdoms
for you to conquer.

32:06.054 --> 32:07.403
Why don't you kill me?

32:09.449 --> 32:11.103
I almost forgot.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.713
Your horse liver.

32:12.756 --> 32:13.975
[chuckles]

32:16.978 --> 32:18.066
[sighs]

32:20.242 --> 32:22.984
I like to keep you
around, Olaf.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.117
You're my pet philosopher.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.770
[chuckles]

32:26.814 --> 32:28.990
Most of you what you say
is ridiculous.

32:30.774 --> 32:33.168
But someday, you might
say something truly wise

32:33.212 --> 32:34.474
and I wouldn't like
to miss it.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.045
Let's take off
those shackles.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.264
You're not going anywhere.

32:43.352 --> 32:46.007
I wouldn't be so sure.

32:46.051 --> 32:50.446
I might just decide
to kill all of you.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.756
[chuckles]

32:55.799 --> 32:58.367
We leave to do your bidding,
King Harald.

32:58.411 --> 33:01.588
May the gods keep you,
and our country, safe.

33:02.676 --> 33:03.851
Men!

33:08.595 --> 33:09.639
[Harald] Safe travels.

33:12.816 --> 33:13.861
[sighs]

33:24.915 --> 33:27.483
I am not jealous.
I was not born that way.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.313
But I see, Bjorn,
that you are
in love with Ingrid.

33:32.836 --> 33:35.056
And nothing
will change that either.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.406
We cannot
control our fate.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.625
We must accept it.

33:44.239 --> 33:47.025
So I think you should
be released from
servitude, Ingrid,

33:47.068 --> 33:49.897
and that you should
marry Bjorn.

33:49.940 --> 33:53.292
We know many kings
who have married
more than one wife.

33:53.335 --> 33:56.164
I think your father
even put that proposal
to your mother.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.038
She turned it down.

34:04.172 --> 34:06.131
If you two
are in agreement,

34:06.174 --> 34:09.090
then we will all
live together.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.961
And our son will have
the benefit of two mothers.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.012
I don't know
what to say.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.234
Perhaps saying nothing
is the best way.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.456
But you should know, Bjorn,

34:27.500 --> 34:30.503
your mother was attacked
by the outlaws
you released from Kattegat.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.769
You are a great man,

34:35.812 --> 34:37.336
but even great men
make mistakes.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.559
[sighs]

34:47.824 --> 34:49.087
[indistinct chatter]

34:55.919 --> 34:56.964
[Bjorn] Why go now?

34:57.573 --> 34:59.880
It is dangerous.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.708
We can leave
before the ice forms.

35:02.578 --> 35:03.492
[sighs]

35:05.799 --> 35:07.322
As you may.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.585
May our gods
keep you safe.

35:09.629 --> 35:12.588
I love and respect you,
as a warrior and as a brother.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.114
We will meet again, brother.

35:16.157 --> 35:18.464
We will talk about
our lives and how

35:18.507 --> 35:20.074
it has all
come to pass.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.353
Torvi, you are with child.

35:38.397 --> 35:41.400
You should not be
undertaking such a journey,
especially in the winter.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.059
Let me kiss
my daughter.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.590
Goodbye, Asa.

35:59.374 --> 36:00.680
You keep your mother
safe, yes?

36:02.856 --> 36:04.074
That's my girl.

36:05.467 --> 36:06.381
Farewell, Bjorn.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.737
Farewell, Gunnhild.

36:14.781 --> 36:18.176
You are
an astonishing woman.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.874
Coming from you, Torvi,
I take that as the greatest
compliment.

36:36.455 --> 36:37.760
[Bjorn] If you find Floki...

36:37.804 --> 36:40.241
You know
I will send word.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.766
Ubbe will find out
the truth, Ketill.
You should know that.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.420
I am not afraid
of the truth.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.206
[sighs]

36:52.471 --> 36:53.515
[sighs]

36:58.303 --> 36:59.739
All who came
before us are dead.

37:01.349 --> 37:03.438
And we are the remainders.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.614
And now we are going
separately on our own paths.

37:07.094 --> 37:08.095
And I am sad.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.230
All I know is that
we will see each other again

37:13.492 --> 37:16.843
in Valhalla,
in Odin's Hall.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.325
And we will be
young again.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.329
We will be
fierce and proud.

37:27.201 --> 37:28.637
We will laugh
and sing.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.467
The gods
will embrace us.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.297
And we will be what
we were always meant to be.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.170
And so this is life,

37:41.563 --> 37:42.564
and so is this death.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.438
Farewell.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.139
[indistinct chatter]

38:09.548 --> 38:11.376
[indistinct chatter]

38:14.117 --> 38:15.380

38:17.164 --> 38:18.383

Hey. Come on! Go on!

38:39.708 --> 38:41.319
Go! Go! Hurry!

40:49.534 --> 40:50.622
What has happened here?

41:00.675 --> 41:02.242
[waves splashing]

41:15.995 --> 41:17.518
[breeze blowing]

41:20.303 --> 41:21.609
[panting]

41:24.917 --> 41:25.787
Ketill?

41:30.400 --> 41:31.489
Oh, Ketill!

41:32.228 --> 41:33.229
Father!

41:35.318 --> 41:36.319
Father!

41:38.670 --> 41:41.324
-[Ketill] Frodi.
-You're hurt!

41:41.368 --> 41:44.545
I was wounded,
but I am well, my son.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.155
[both laugh]

41:46.199 --> 41:47.679
It makes me
so happy to see you.

41:49.811 --> 41:50.769
Ingvild.

41:50.812 --> 41:51.944
[Frodi laughs]

41:57.732 --> 42:00.387
[Ingvild] Husband.
You've been gone so long.

42:00.430 --> 42:02.302
We thought
you might have drowned!

42:02.345 --> 42:05.435
I will tell you soon
of my adventures.

42:05.479 --> 42:07.742
In the meantime,
look who I have brought.

42:09.918 --> 42:12.965
Ubbe, the son of Ragnar.

42:13.008 --> 42:15.402
His wife Torvi,
the shield-maiden.

42:15.445 --> 42:17.796
And their daughter, Asa.

42:17.839 --> 42:21.582
Ubbe. Torvi.
Welcome, welcome.

42:21.626 --> 42:23.715
And you are with child.

42:23.758 --> 42:25.543
Come into the temple, please.

42:25.586 --> 42:28.328
Rest after your journey
and then we will feast.

42:28.371 --> 42:29.982
The gods be blessed.

42:30.025 --> 42:33.507
A son of Ragnar Lothbrok
come to our poor settlement.

42:35.204 --> 42:36.771
Whatever next?

42:36.815 --> 42:40.906
Our guests are tired
and very hungry, Ingvild.

42:40.949 --> 42:43.604
Of course.
This way, please.

42:45.824 --> 42:47.434
[young man] Welcome, welcome.

42:48.478 --> 42:49.567
Let me help you.

42:52.874 --> 42:54.659
[indistinct chatter]

43:04.277 --> 43:07.280
Lord Odin. Why did they
have to come here?

43:08.673 --> 43:12.241
Allfather,
what have you done?

43:12.807 --> 43:14.592
[sighs]

43:20.685 --> 43:22.425
And what does
this signify?

43:24.689 --> 43:26.299
Tell King Harald
what you saw.

43:31.696 --> 43:34.960
What did these raiders
look like?

43:35.003 --> 43:38.093
Strange men
with strange voices.

43:39.747 --> 43:41.880
Wearing furs
and riding horses.

43:41.923 --> 43:45.797
They came
and went like ghosts!

43:46.711 --> 43:49.017
[chuckles]

43:49.061 --> 43:51.237
Whatever they are,
they are not ghosts.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.847
They are not ghosts!

43:52.891 --> 43:53.718
[chuckles]

43:58.723 --> 43:59.767
What do you say,

44:02.378 --> 44:03.728
old King Olaf?

44:03.771 --> 44:05.251
Hmm?

44:05.294 --> 44:07.688
[King Olaf]
These are an alien people

44:07.732 --> 44:11.518
who have staked a claim
to our land.

44:11.561 --> 44:13.868
And one day
they will return.

44:15.478 --> 44:17.306
Not as a raiding party,

44:18.699 --> 44:20.266
but as an army.

44:30.755 --> 44:32.844
[music playing]
