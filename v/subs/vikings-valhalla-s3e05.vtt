WEBVTT

01:24.417 --> 01:25.585
You lost the boat.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.129
The waves came up.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.924
We could barely save ourselves.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.259
The fish are too far out.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.888
The water too deep
for the boats we have left.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.641
Forgive my son, Erik.

01:39.724 --> 01:43.394
His best friend, Trygve,
was on the boat when we lost them.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.440
It was all we could catch.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.612
Please, take.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.201
No.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.079
Share with the others.

02:01.996 --> 02:02.831
Thank you.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.108
There is talk among women
that when the traders come again,

02:30.191 --> 02:32.527
a few will try and return to Norway.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.697
There is always talk.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.991
We have had hard times before.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.659
Not like this.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.162
No fish close to shore

02:42.245 --> 02:45.290
and no wood to repair the boats
so we can reach them.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.792
They think the gods have forsaken them.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.128
What do you think?

02:50.920 --> 02:53.882
The gods like to taunt me.

02:53.965 --> 02:58.094
They know I cannot return
to Norway or Iceland.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.681
And I cannot remain here alone.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.684
They test me…

03:05.768 --> 03:07.270
but they never abandon me.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.819
When the traders come,

03:16.988 --> 03:18.031
we will be ready.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.385
Hail Ægir!

03:39.469 --> 03:44.641
May our lost sea-farers

03:44.724 --> 03:50.688
be welcomed to Your golden hall
by your daughters…

03:52.732 --> 03:53.566
Traders!

04:18.132 --> 04:19.133
Is this your home?

04:20.718 --> 04:21.636
It used to be.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.226
Father!

04:28.935 --> 04:30.561
It is Freydis!

04:30.645 --> 04:32.230
Our daughter returns!

04:38.444 --> 04:39.946
Father!

04:46.494 --> 04:47.829
Let me look at you.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.081
Freydis!

04:50.665 --> 04:51.749
Mother!

04:52.500 --> 04:53.876
Oh!

04:53.960 --> 04:57.839
I had given up hope
of ever seeing you again.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.424
Who are all these people?

05:02.593 --> 05:03.761
They are my people.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.224
We have come from Jomsborg
to find a new home. I am their leader.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.103
My little girl…

05:13.396 --> 05:14.564
is a leader.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.859
My mother's not a little girl.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.486
She is a great warrior
and a shield-maiden.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.905
And who says this, huh?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.741
A ferocious bear cub?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.160
No, I am Harald Haraldsson.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.662
Your grandson.

05:30.997 --> 05:35.126
So this is where all the red
from my beard went, huh?

05:37.545 --> 05:40.214
I am pleased to meet you,
Harald Haraldsson.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.549
My name is Erik.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.094
Is this the father?

05:45.178 --> 05:47.305
No. My name is Stígr.

05:47.972 --> 05:51.309
He is my partner.
Harald's father is not with us.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.314
Thank the gods you have returned.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.776
Yes. Thank the gods.

06:01.110 --> 06:05.281
People of Jomsborg, I am Erik the Red!
Welcome to Greenland!

06:15.708 --> 06:16.709
No boat today.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.130
How am I to believe that?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.234
No, thanks.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.238
You are about
to see something amazing…

06:48.783 --> 06:51.035
You roll that again

06:51.119 --> 06:55.540
and we will all believe
you are in league with the devil.

06:55.623 --> 06:59.210
Not me, Father!
The Lord simply appreciates my style.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.299
Welcome, stranger.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.468
Can we help you?

07:07.552 --> 07:10.096
I am looking for someone from this town.

07:10.972 --> 07:11.848
A mapmaker.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.643
That would be me.
My name is Calinicus.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.939
I'm Leif. I believe I have a map of yours.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.650
I was hoping to speak to you about it.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.992
You are mistaken. This is not one of mine.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.328
- Are you sure?
- I know my maps.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.875
I am sorry. Where are my manners? Come.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.252
You have traveled far.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.379
Join me and my family for a meal. Yes?

07:43.963 --> 07:44.797
Yes.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.605
You can leave your bags here.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.899
We will be having one more.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.252
You have been
to all these places?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.170
No.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.297
That headland,

08:27.048 --> 08:30.092
that is the furthest from home
I have been by boat.

08:31.385 --> 08:35.097
But thankfully, I have a doorstep
on which the entire world washes up.

08:43.272 --> 08:47.401
A Viking who speaks Greek,
who can operate an Arab astrolabe.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.529
And now he's in my workshop.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.493
Leif.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.705
The children
are not as dangerous as they look.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.124
Oh.

09:04.001 --> 09:04.835
Sorry.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.433
Do you recognize it?

09:19.517 --> 09:20.935
It is a cold water fish.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.729
I'd catch it when I was young.

09:26.983 --> 09:27.984
Lionfish.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.069
Deadly.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.531
Now, let's have a look at my map.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.575
I thought it wasn't yours.

09:36.325 --> 09:39.954
I claim them when it is safe to do so
and lie when it is not.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.960
Yes. It is mine.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.129
Or a part of it.

09:49.255 --> 09:53.301
I gave it to a mariner many years ago.
Where did you find it?

09:53.384 --> 09:56.095
In Sicily, in <i>The Book of the Unknown.</i>

09:58.639 --> 10:00.182
A fitting home for it.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.726
So,

10:03.311 --> 10:04.729
what do you want to know?

10:04.812 --> 10:06.105
What it is a map of.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.441
You tell me.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.861
Well, I think…

10:12.945 --> 10:15.114
this is the southern coast of Greenland.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.826
This is a little settlement
where I am from.

10:20.286 --> 10:24.665
And this is a land
I believe I saw when I was young.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.753
I want to know if it exists.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.548
I am sorry. I cannot answer that.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.177
But you drew it.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.803
I draw many things.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.514
You must've heard of it
from someone who saw it.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.766
No.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.560
Well, then what are your maps based on?

10:49.857 --> 10:51.859
Come. We will eat.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.087
Some food. Food and drink, please!

11:11.629 --> 11:12.838
Gentle with that.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.095
Here.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.224
There must have been a famine.

11:24.308 --> 11:25.476
This is a hard place.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.186
Thank you.

11:32.691 --> 11:36.153
That is not necessary.
Erik has asked us to watch it for you.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.409
We would feel better with our lock.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.460
Leif brought down London Bridge?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.503
Yeah.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.798
And a Viking is the King of England?

11:55.881 --> 11:59.510
And you, a shield-maiden of Kattegat.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.428
A warrior.

12:00.511 --> 12:05.015
And where is Leif? Is he returning soon?

12:05.724 --> 12:07.560
We parted ways…

12:08.269 --> 12:09.437
seven years ago.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.771
I have lost track of him.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.816
You parted with your family?

12:13.899 --> 12:14.817
Yes.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.112
He sought his future in the Rus

12:18.195 --> 12:21.907
with Prince Harald Sigurdsson,
my Harald's father.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.618
A prince of Norway.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.871
And a Christian.

12:28.622 --> 12:32.042
- You did not wish to accompany them?
- No.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.420
I met a seer in Uppsala and was given…

12:35.254 --> 12:36.881
a vision and my destiny.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.884
It took me to Jomsborg
to be the keeper of the old faith.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.595
What do you mean, "the old faith"?

12:43.179 --> 12:46.140
Much has changed
since you were last in Norway, Father.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.725
It is a Christian world now.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.810
No places left for believers in the gods.

12:50.811 --> 12:53.647
That is why we are here,
to find a new home.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.197
Stígr saved our lives
after a Christian poisoned us.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.533
Ah, a healer.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.327
And a great fighter.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.663
So many stories, I cannot keep up.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.667
But now that you're here,

13:14.376 --> 13:16.128
we have plenty of time to catch up.

13:16.795 --> 13:17.838
Did you tell him?

13:19.715 --> 13:21.717
We need to leave before the summer ends.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.011
Leave?

13:27.723 --> 13:28.557
Yes.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.060
Greenland is not our destination.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.271
We are going further west

13:34.355 --> 13:36.524
to the Golden Land
Leif told us of as a child.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.109
The "Golden Land"?

13:39.193 --> 13:40.027
Yes.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.241
And you have come a long way
on a childhood story.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.580
I am convinced it is the same place
I saw in my vision.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.708
It is my destiny and I'm going to find it.

13:59.380 --> 14:05.344
Well, first, we must celebrate
your return with a feast.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.056
Oh, merciful and compassionate God,

14:09.139 --> 14:11.642
we thank you for this meal
and our many blessings,

14:11.725 --> 14:14.812
and for gracing us with a guest
to share it with.

14:14.895 --> 14:15.729
Amen.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.314
Amen.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.566
Amen.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.571
Please. It is caught today,
right outside our door.

14:26.824 --> 14:27.992
Do you recognize it?

14:28.826 --> 14:30.703
It tastes like a fish from Greenland.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.289
The fish that is in your workshop.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.083
Because it is the same fish.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.002
Impossible.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.671
It is native of the North.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.964
Are you sure?

14:42.047 --> 14:42.882
Mmm.

14:43.424 --> 14:47.094
Perhaps it is a native of Greece
and only likes to travel.

14:47.761 --> 14:51.724
Well, let's say you're right.
How would it get from here to Greenland?

14:52.308 --> 14:53.183
Currents.

14:54.101 --> 14:58.022
Great rivers in the sea
that run from east to west.

14:58.105 --> 15:01.692
Unfortunately, the currents in Greenland
run from west to east.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.613
Yet proof that one does
is stuck in your beard.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.198
Where is it?

15:13.412 --> 15:15.372


15:18.417 --> 15:20.002
A piece of wood…

15:20.920 --> 15:24.173
from the cross Our Lord,
Jesus Christ, died on.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.008
A most sacred relic indeed.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.428
How did you secure
such a blessed object, Your Highness?

15:29.511 --> 15:33.057
I helped His Holiness
with a private problem.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.060
The King's visit to Rome

15:36.143 --> 15:39.229
confirms England's importance
in the Christian world.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.440
And we're in your debt, Your Highness.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.693
The Empire has never looked more secure.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.363
Your Highness,

15:48.405 --> 15:51.408
I've taken the liberty
of composing a charter for land.

15:52.701 --> 15:53.869
To build a great church

15:55.037 --> 15:57.039
so we may mark your visit to Rome.

15:58.165 --> 16:02.211
A place where people can give thanks
for the Pope's blessings.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.716
An excellent idea.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.512
And I will ensure the King reads it.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.645
As my empire grows stronger,

16:22.648 --> 16:24.066
I become weaker.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.112
Before,

16:29.530 --> 16:32.700
I could cut a man's head off
with one swipe of my axe.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.080
Now, I struggle to hold papers.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.505
Anyone can hold an axe, my love.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.550
But only the great can rule.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.308
Your strength does not rest in your hands.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.396
It encompasses your entire being.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.236
When I took England and became King,

17:10.362 --> 17:12.531
I promised that I would keep you safe.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.244
That I would never leave you exposed
as Æthelred did.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.245
And you have.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.709
But I will not be here much longer.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.337
- Come.
- Don't. Don't speak of it.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.144
His Holiness was right.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.106
I must think of my legacy.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.071
My sons are each like their father,

17:54.239 --> 17:55.157
quarrelsome,

17:57.159 --> 17:58.035
strong,

18:00.079 --> 18:01.080
and vicious.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.755
I have decided to go to Kattegat,

18:11.340 --> 18:14.176
and I want all of my sons and yours

18:15.594 --> 18:16.595
to meet me there.

18:20.891 --> 18:24.019
-

18:26.814 --> 18:27.898
Halt, whoa.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.443
Keep watch there.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.448
Earl Godwin.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.370
- I need your help.
- Of course, Your Highness.

18:42.037 --> 18:45.415
My men around Canute inform me
that my son's health is failing.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.628
It's my opinion
that neither of his sons with Aelfgifu

18:49.711 --> 18:51.338
will be the next King of England.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.841
What are you talking about?

18:53.924 --> 18:57.427
Canute wouldn't pass the crown
to Emma's sons, if that's your concern.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.345
No.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.723
I agree.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.434
You can't be suggesting
that it goes to Harthacanute?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.061
He's a child.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.981
That's not what your
grandfather's suggesting, Prince Harefoot.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.361
He's saying that
the next King of England is himself.

19:17.865 --> 19:18.824
That is absurd.

19:19.950 --> 19:23.370
Grandfather, you're a great Viking,
but you are an old man.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.672
Tell him, Godwin. It is a joke.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.968
I think it's an excellent idea,
Your Highness.

19:40.637 --> 19:41.847
How may I be of service?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.643
What? You can't be serious.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.020
I most certainly am.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.357
You are too inexperienced
to assume the crown,

19:52.441 --> 19:55.944
as are Emma's sons and Harthacanute,
and Svein will remain in Norway,

19:56.028 --> 19:59.406
whereas your grandfather
has ruled England in your father's absence

19:59.489 --> 20:01.867
and the nobles there, they respect him.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.995
You promised me your help.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.999
I only promised that when your time comes,

20:09.082 --> 20:11.752
I would offer you
the same loyalty and council

20:11.835 --> 20:14.338
that I offer your father and grandfather.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.676
It's a question of timing.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.399
I knew I could count on you.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.704
My family
is really important to me.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.165
I can see that.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.417
Good.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.587
There is something else
I want to share with you.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.466
While these maps feed my family,

21:01.301 --> 21:02.219
this…

21:04.096 --> 21:05.472
is what feeds my mind.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.852
The known world.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.621
And a world not so well-known.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.211
Why do you hide this?

21:36.295 --> 21:41.008
Because much of what you see here
is considered heresy by the Church.

21:43.051 --> 21:47.597
There is no Garden of Eden, for instance,
and you will notice its shape is round.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.560
It is not heresy if it is true.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.021
Truth can still make my children orphans.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.960
I traveled this river.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.059
You were right. This is Greenland.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.312
And the lines are currents.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.772
Rivers in the sea.

22:38.398 --> 22:39.775
But like I said,

22:41.068 --> 22:43.153
the currents run west to east,
past Greenland.

22:43.236 --> 22:49.117
Yes, but you are assuming that
those are two different currents.

22:49.201 --> 22:53.371
What if it is not two,
but the same one that carries our fish?

22:53.455 --> 22:57.209
Only something large
could turn a current that powerful.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.919
Something, perhaps…

23:00.504 --> 23:01.379
like this?

23:11.348 --> 23:12.349
So, it is true.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.602
I saw this.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.438
I saw another world.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.648
Maybe.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.736
What do you mean? This is proof.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.656
No, that is parchment.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.700
For proof, someone must find it.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.664


23:42.087 --> 23:43.213
All hail

23:44.005 --> 23:46.341
the Viking Emperor.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.596
You of all people
know my desires lie elsewhere.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.640
'Tis a good thing.

23:54.474 --> 23:57.978
An emperor's reign
can be all too fleeting.

23:58.061 --> 24:01.648
Constantine barely lasted a year
on that throne.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.943
Romanos has held power
for almost a decade.

24:05.902 --> 24:07.904
It's an impressive achievement.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.032
He's an impressive leader.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.368
I've learned much from him

24:14.161 --> 24:15.745
and have much still to learn.

24:17.747 --> 24:21.251
That sounds like
you are in no hurry to leave.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.673
I will leave Constantinople
when I'm ready.

24:27.799 --> 24:28.758
Not before.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.455
Everything feels so much smaller.

25:00.415 --> 25:02.834
The beach, the long house.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.087
Even my mother.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.173
It is you that is different.

25:09.507 --> 25:13.345
Since you left, you traveled,
fought, became a leader.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.975
Greenland's the same.
It's you who has grown.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.104
Welcome. Welcome, Jomspeople,

25:23.188 --> 25:26.650
exhausted after your journey and ordeal.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.695
To have lost your home and loved ones.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.740
The cruel sting of exile.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.410
This, I know.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.288
This, I understand.

25:41.581 --> 25:45.293
But you are safe here,
you're welcome in our community

25:45.377 --> 25:48.630
built to provide shelter
for those seeking freedom

25:49.214 --> 25:50.257
from persecution.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.344
And tonight, I command you…

25:54.928 --> 25:56.721
to eat your fill and relax.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.849
Tonight, what is mine is yours

25:59.933 --> 26:04.938
and it would seem what is yours is mine.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.316
Thank you
for sharing your provisions.

26:08.984 --> 26:09.943
Tonight,

26:10.986 --> 26:15.240
we also celebrate
my daughter's return to her home!

26:21.121 --> 26:24.958
I have been thinking
about this journey of yours.

26:25.875 --> 26:26.793
This plan.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.170
Look at your people.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.965
Have they not been through enough?

26:32.048 --> 26:34.968
That is why I wish
to take them someplace they are safe.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.261
Well, why not here?

26:37.220 --> 26:41.266
There are farms standing empty,
earth waiting to be tilled.

26:42.058 --> 26:45.186
It has been a tough winter,
but you know about those.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.521
You have seed, supplies.

26:46.604 --> 26:49.357
You could rebuild
the entire Western settlement.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.693
Call it Freydis-fjord.

26:51.776 --> 26:56.614
Father, this isn't only for me.
I'm doing this for my people.

26:57.198 --> 26:59.743
Let me show you the farms tomorrow.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.749
- Especially--
- Would you like some company tonight?

27:06.583 --> 27:07.417
No.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.085
You heard what our leader said,

27:09.711 --> 27:11.963
what's yours is mine.

27:13.548 --> 27:16.051
If you come any closer,
I'll stab you in the heart.

27:17.594 --> 27:21.264
You will find it hard to stab him
when I'm holding you down.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.683
Go back to your own table.

27:24.559 --> 27:27.145
- What was that you said?
- You heard me.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.229
Tell them to stop.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.232
He's a grown man.
He can look after himself.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.069
I'm not worried about Stígr.
I'm worried about your men.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.987
Who do you think you are talking to?

27:36.071 --> 27:38.865
You're drunk. I do not want to hurt you.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.129
What is this?

28:19.989 --> 28:21.157
You come to my home

28:21.950 --> 28:23.618
and humiliate my men.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.246
No. Wait.

28:34.295 --> 28:37.215
And now I know why my daughter
likes you so much!

28:51.271 --> 28:52.564
You are disappointed.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.112
I came here looking for answers.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.490
You have given me questions.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.618
I saw you pray today.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.662
Do you believe in God?

29:09.122 --> 29:11.124
There are times that I have doubted Him.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.754
But I have seen
enough evidence of His power

29:15.837 --> 29:17.297
to believe He exists.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.215
It is the same with my maps.

29:20.467 --> 29:24.137
They are an accumulation
of evidence, of science

29:24.220 --> 29:27.724
that point to the existence
of something I believe to be real.

29:29.225 --> 29:32.187
If you want physical proof, however,
you will not find it here.

29:33.521 --> 29:35.064
It is out there.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.443
Beyond the headline.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.783
It is waiting for someone
with your skills to discover it.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.852
Oh!

30:22.654 --> 30:24.739
You answered many questions today,

30:25.865 --> 30:27.200
but not an important one.

30:28.409 --> 30:30.328
The one that sent you to Norway.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.998
Did you kill him?

30:36.376 --> 30:37.252
Yes.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.255
And I carved a cross on his chest.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.845
Of all your stories, that is my favorite.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.139
It was a long time ago.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.809
I have changed since then.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.063
No matter what you say,
I am the leader of these people.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.147
That will not change.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.067
Some things are hard to accept.

31:01.150 --> 31:04.362
I know how proud you are
to have built this place,

31:04.445 --> 31:06.739
to have survived here
beyond expectations, but--

31:06.823 --> 31:08.491
Surviving is how we win.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.243
But can you call this winning?

31:12.495 --> 31:15.248
Much has changed
since you've been gone, daughter.

31:16.916 --> 31:17.750
First,

31:18.543 --> 31:22.672
the fish moved far to the South
and with them went the narwhal and walrus

31:23.256 --> 31:25.341
whose ivory brought in the traders.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.595
Without trees to repair our boats,
we had no way to follow them.

31:29.304 --> 31:32.181
And then winters began to take their toll.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.476
The Golden Land
can be good for both our people.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.061
- It won't.
- Why do you say that?

31:37.145 --> 31:38.146
Because…

31:41.190 --> 31:46.195
Because I spent years
trying to find it and I couldn't.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.241
I'm not blind, Freydis.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.411
Do you think I cannot see
what is happening to my people?

31:53.995 --> 31:55.872
After you and Leif left,

31:55.955 --> 32:00.335
I sailed again and again
to where he thought he had seen it,

32:00.418 --> 32:04.631
if it was out there,
we would be there instead of here,

32:04.714 --> 32:08.259
where the wind never stops
and the gods laugh at me.

32:13.389 --> 32:15.141
Leif's Golden Land

32:15.975 --> 32:16.976
is a fantasy.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.688
I trust my vision

32:21.814 --> 32:22.982
and you cannot stop me.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.152
Stubborn.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.822
Where did I get that from?

32:40.291 --> 32:43.962
At least let us use one of your boats
for fishing before you leave.

32:45.088 --> 32:45.922
Of course.

32:48.841 --> 32:51.719
Now, go get some sleep.
I'm still your father.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.583
You don't have the courage to do it.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.425
Godwin?

35:56.904 --> 35:58.531
Good night, Your Highness.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.752
We will meet you up at the house.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.255
I'll be there shortly.

38:31.225 --> 38:34.061
Zoe, I need to talk with you.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.011
Harald.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.144
Is that you?

39:18.481 --> 39:21.150
Emperor. I apologize.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.445
I did not realize
it was you who summoned me.

39:24.528 --> 39:28.324
I did not summon you,
but I am glad you are here.

39:29.658 --> 39:30.868
I want to talk to you.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.716
Over the years,

39:47.426 --> 39:48.511
we've grown close.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.265
You are like a brother to me.

39:53.974 --> 39:55.893
And you to me, Emperor.

39:56.977 --> 40:00.314
And as a brother, I know you well.

40:01.774 --> 40:02.733
Your strengths

40:04.735 --> 40:06.278
and your weaknesses.

40:09.865 --> 40:11.450
- Emperor…
- Shh, shh, shh.

40:12.118 --> 40:16.372
You think I would not know
if you were sleeping with my wife?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.501
I knew if I asked you,

40:21.961 --> 40:24.130
it would make things awkward between us.

40:27.091 --> 40:27.967
So…

40:30.594 --> 40:32.513
I let my wife seduce you.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.475
Why?

40:38.853 --> 40:40.729
Because I cannot give her a child.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.944
So, who better to provide an heir

40:48.696 --> 40:51.157
than my beloved brother?

40:55.202 --> 40:56.412
No!

40:59.915 --> 41:01.459
Emperor! Stop her!

41:01.542 --> 41:03.919
No, no! No!

41:06.213 --> 41:07.047
No!

41:10.801 --> 41:12.178
He's killed the Emperor!

41:13.137 --> 41:15.222
No! It was a trap!

41:18.934 --> 41:19.935
Arrest him.

41:20.853 --> 41:21.729
Hey!
