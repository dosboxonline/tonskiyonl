01:09.069 --> 01:10.986
Open your eyes.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.910
Open your eyes.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.290
Open your...

04:11.876 --> 04:14.044
Open your eyes.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.464
Open your eyes.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.927
David, open your...

04:23.346 --> 04:27.266
I suppose the empty street
meant loneliness.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.519
You're a shrink.
You've got to do better than that.

04:30.687 --> 04:34.064
I'm a doctor.
Let's not stereotype each other.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.566
Not all rich kids are soulless,

04:36.776 --> 04:40.153
and not all psychologists
care about dreams.

04:40.321 --> 04:44.741
The question is how you got here
and why you've been charged.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.995
What do you want to know?
I was about to turn 33.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.748
I ran three magazines
in a worldwide publishing house.

04:51.916 --> 04:56.920
Most days I fooled myself
into believing it would last forever.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.589
Isn't that what being young is about?

04:59.757 --> 05:04.720
Believing secretly that you would be
the one person in the history of man

05:04.887 --> 05:06.805
who would live forever?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.686
Where are you going so early?

05:12.895 --> 05:15.564
Don't record any more messages
on my alarm clock.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.399
Why not?

05:17.567 --> 05:20.152
I'll start to think we're married
or something.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.070
Don't ever say that word.

05:22.238 --> 05:26.700
I'll never bring you chicken soup
and fuck your brains out again.

05:27.243 --> 05:32.581
- How's your cold?
- Still there. How about yours?

05:32.749 --> 05:36.585
- You definitely took my mind off it.
- Really?

05:37.503 --> 05:39.755
Yes!

05:46.929 --> 05:48.972
Juliana here.

05:49.098 --> 05:52.726
Hi, Rayna. I missed my audition,
I lost my head!

05:52.894 --> 05:54.770
Listen, I have to go.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.980
I'm with David.

06:01.027 --> 06:06.490
Help yourself to whatever you want.
Set the alarm before you go. And...

06:08.743 --> 06:10.452
You are the greatest.

06:11.287 --> 06:15.457
- Bye, honey!
- Bye, honey. I'll call you later.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.958
When?

06:18.044 --> 06:20.337
- When?
- Soon!

07:05.383 --> 07:07.259
Did you reserve the court?

07:07.427 --> 07:11.054
Easy. I can't handle heavy conversation
at this ungodly hour.

07:11.222 --> 07:15.392
Sorry to do this early.
I've got to be done by 10:00.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.186
You're not going
to make the 8:45, are you?

07:18.396 --> 07:19.896
How did you find me?

07:20.022 --> 07:22.858
You have to check the colours
for the new issue.

07:22.984 --> 07:27.654
- What are the colours?
- Yellow and red, or the traditional white.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.241
- Got to think about it.
- David, please.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.994
Don't be late for the 10 o' clock
with the board.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.331
Don't tell anybody where I am.
I don't care if God calls. I'm very busy.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.299
- Can't you get rid of that board?
- The Seven Dwarfs?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.217
They drive you nuts.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.596
That was the desire of my father
who hired them.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.602
You fucked Julie Gianni again, didn't you?

07:58.769 --> 08:03.231
I know someone was there
when I called. You had that tone.

08:03.399 --> 08:07.486
"Oh, no, man. I've got a cold.
I'm hanging in today."

08:07.653 --> 08:09.821
I had a cold.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.866
- I was alone.
- Fine.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.494
You can do what you want
with your life,

08:15.661 --> 08:18.121
but one day you'll know
what love truly is.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.373
It's the sour and the sweet.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.002
I know sour, which allows me
to appreciate the sweet.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.672
Julie Gianni is a friend.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.133
Sometimes we sleep together.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.471
What? What?

08:34.639 --> 08:38.558
My dream girl, Julie Gianni,

08:39.352 --> 08:42.270
is your fuck buddy!

08:42.980 --> 08:45.774
- What do you want to listen to?
- Slow down.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.568
What have we got here?
Barcelona...

08:49.779 --> 08:50.987
Radiohead?

08:51.155 --> 08:52.572
Look out!

08:54.242 --> 08:55.283
Fuck!

08:58.996 --> 09:00.705
Fuck!

09:04.293 --> 09:05.919
We almost died.

09:06.045 --> 09:10.173
I know. My own death was right
there in front of me.

09:10.341 --> 09:13.760
You know what happened?
Your life flashed before my eyes.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.555
- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.892
We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.270
- Morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

09:23.437 --> 09:26.273
- Eaten anything yet?
- No.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.109
David, you were playing
racquetball.

09:29.277 --> 09:33.738
I've been covering you for an hour
and you're playing racquetball.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.740
We are exiting the elevator.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.534
The board is not happy.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.119
Hello, David.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.622
You're in "The Post". Courtney Love
called to see if you got her e-mail

09:42.832 --> 09:46.334
and Graydon Carter called to see
if you're still on for dinner.

09:46.502 --> 09:51.047
The art department still need the decision
on the colours for the bikini issue.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.925
Did I mention the board is pissed?
You're late.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.512
David, hold up!
Choose one!

09:57.680 --> 10:00.015
Wait! This one? David!

10:00.182 --> 10:02.559
They're all waiting for you.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.895
- You changed your hair.
- Yes, and David...

10:06.022 --> 10:09.149
...opinions are expected.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.656
David.

10:17.033 --> 10:21.369
Do you dream about the board,
the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?

10:21.537 --> 10:24.664
Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy,

10:24.874 --> 10:30.378
Happy, Doc, Dopey
and, of course, Grumpy.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.965
- How was Aspen?
- Good.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.636
Now, I want answers
and I want them now.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.561
How's it going?

10:46.729 --> 10:50.273
They still look at me
as if I was 11 years old.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.735
He's going to inherit everything.
He gets it all.

10:55.446 --> 10:59.449
- Are you scared of your dreams?
- It's a nightmare either way.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.118
Is that how you explain
what's happened to you?

11:02.286 --> 11:04.412
What happened to your face?

11:04.580 --> 11:08.208
- I'm not talking to you any more.
- You don't want to show me your face?

11:08.376 --> 11:10.001
No!

11:13.506 --> 11:16.841
- Do you know why you're here?
- The conversation, the coffee...

11:16.967 --> 11:19.761
David, the part where we parry and joust

11:19.929 --> 11:24.391
and get to know each other
bit by bit... No can do.

11:24.558 --> 11:28.853
We'll have to skip that because
you've been charged with murder.

11:28.979 --> 11:33.483
In four weeks, a judge will determine
your fate based on what I write.

11:33.651 --> 11:37.445
- So you will talk to me.
- There is no murder.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.574
There is no murder!

11:41.909 --> 11:44.285
It never happened.

11:45.162 --> 11:48.123
I don't have to talk to anybody!

11:48.290 --> 11:50.834
- Want me to help?
- Get away from me.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.503
Easy, Face!
Your whole story's full of holes!

11:53.713 --> 11:58.550
Stop. Stop! Please leave right now.
I'll take responsibility.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.053
Please leave right now.
He's got control.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.515
I'm going to get you,
daddy's boy, little freak!

12:05.683 --> 12:08.852
- My parents are dead, you fuck!
- Enough!

12:10.730 --> 12:13.356
- Is that true?
- Good cop, bad cop.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.942
That you're a daddy's boy?

12:16.652 --> 12:19.571
Primer on David Aames, Senior.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.574
My father wasn't built
for the 21 st century.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.453
He never went to McDonalds.
He never watched television,

12:26.620 --> 12:30.331
yet his biggest magazine
is still the "TV Digest".

12:30.499 --> 12:33.960
He and my mother threw the grandest
parties of the literary world.

12:34.086 --> 12:37.422
Ballooned, jumped out of aeroplanes.
He sought adventure.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.924
His autobiography is the manual

12:40.050 --> 12:42.385
for every cut-throat publisher in New York.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.054
It's called "Defending The Kingdom".

12:45.222 --> 12:48.391
I've read it. Page 127:

12:49.101 --> 12:52.103
"David Junior was a delight as a child."

12:52.313 --> 12:55.857
Did I miss something here?
Is that all he wrote about you?

12:56.192 --> 12:59.277
I don't think he ever got over the fact

13:00.237 --> 13:05.366
that I'm absolutely terrified
of heights.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.369
The irony continues.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.665
When he and my mother were run over
by a drunken teenager

13:12.875 --> 13:15.835
on New Year's Eve, ten years ago,

13:15.961 --> 13:19.422
he left the keys to the kingdom...

13:20.424 --> 13:21.800
...to me.

13:21.967 --> 13:26.221
51% control. 49% going to a group
of seven board members

13:26.430 --> 13:30.683
who all thought they were first in line.

13:30.851 --> 13:33.978
And you believe the board,
the Seven Dwarfs,

13:34.146 --> 13:37.482
put you here to take control
of your company?

13:39.985 --> 13:43.613
- What do you care?
- We're just talking.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.033
Tonight's Wednesday night.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.912
I go out for dinner with my
two daughters on Wednesday,

13:51.038 --> 13:53.081
so I'll have to leave soon.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.167
You understand that our time
is limited, don't you?

13:59.547 --> 14:01.673
If I talk...

14:01.966 --> 14:04.425
you'll just think I'm crazy.

14:15.896 --> 14:19.399
With all the possible respect
I can offer a man

14:19.567 --> 14:23.820
wearing a latex mask and spouting
conspiracy theories, David...

14:24.530 --> 14:27.156
...believe me.
You've crossed that bridge.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.034
Enjoy your dinner.

14:32.329 --> 14:36.207
There are five basic emotions
in life, David.

14:37.918 --> 14:43.089
Tell me, what emotion gripped him
before he entered that cell?

14:44.133 --> 14:47.093
Was it guilt? Hate?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.306
Shame?

14:53.434 --> 14:54.601
Revenge?

15:02.484 --> 15:03.610
Love?

15:04.528 --> 15:07.238
I'm completely on the wrong track,
aren't I?

15:13.162 --> 15:14.996
Who needs ice?

15:16.665 --> 15:19.334
- Hey, Emma!
- David, happy birthday.

15:19.543 --> 15:22.837
You have got the greatest taste
in shoes bar none.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.756
Emma, have you met Lynette?

15:24.924 --> 15:28.593
No, but I shudder to think
what we might have in common.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.137
Did you invite
the entire snowboarding team?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.680
It is my birthday.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.433
- Say happy birthday to David.
- Happy birthday.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.563
Welcome to Graceland.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.361
Happy birthday, you sonofabitch!

15:46.987 --> 15:48.988
Happy birthday!

15:50.282 --> 15:51.866
Friends of me!

15:52.034 --> 15:54.077
Let the fun ensue.

15:56.413 --> 16:00.833
...the great John Coltrane.
They would love an article on it.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.753
It's an amazing, amazing product.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.049
No, that's OK. I've got it.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.264
- Literary god, Brian Shelby.
- Happy birthday!

16:15.432 --> 16:19.936
- And all the usual shit. How you doing?
- Living the dream, baby.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.854
David Aames.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.149
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- The pleasure of Sofia Serrano.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.902
We met today at the library.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.990
- My coat's too big for your closet.
- We were pretending to be intellectuals.

16:32.116 --> 16:36.369
- It's amazing. I love your coat.
- I overdressed. I mean, I underdressed.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.913
I'll continue like you're both
listening to me.

16:39.039 --> 16:43.543
- Do you have another room to put it in?
- I have ceased to exist.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.796
Madison Square Garden is nearby.
It might fit there.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.967
- Happy birthday.
- We picked it out together.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.220
- Thank you.
- We picked it out together. We.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.264
You're welcome.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.435
Stop flirting and open it.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.897
- Let's get a drink!
- Yes.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.275
I'll leave this upstairs.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.961
- Listen...
- Hey, Tommy.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.796
Don't blow me off.

17:28.964 --> 17:32.842
I'm all packed, I'm going back
to London and I understand.

17:32.968 --> 17:36.345
You put me up for that attorney's job
so you didn't have to fire me.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.640
A classy move.
Your father would have done the same.

17:39.808 --> 17:43.478
- It's OK, Tommy.
- I became incompetent.

17:43.645 --> 17:47.982
Is there anything more unbecoming
than an ageing mascot?

17:48.817 --> 17:52.987
I cared for your father.
I lived and breathed for him.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.573
These guys, the Seven Dwarfs,

17:55.741 --> 17:59.535
they think you're stupid.
A corporate hazard, a rogue.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.163
They'll find a way
to catch you out, David.

18:02.331 --> 18:07.001
They're lined up for your office,
your life, your position.

18:07.586 --> 18:12.215
They're working day and night
to cheat you out of your 51% vote.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.635
And they're going to sell
this tradition of words

18:15.803 --> 18:18.805
so they can eat in a better cafeteria.

18:19.765 --> 18:24.185
What they don't know is this.
People will read again!

18:24.353 --> 18:25.895
Yeah.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.564
I got it.

18:28.774 --> 18:32.860
They've even got a nickname for you
behind your back.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.031
Citizen... Dildo.

18:38.534 --> 18:42.995
You've got great instincts,
but I say this with complete love.

18:43.664 --> 18:47.959
Claim your life.
Learn to be an asshole...

18:48.085 --> 18:52.255
- Two's enough.
- Forgive me.

18:53.841 --> 18:58.886
I still believe in this family, David,
even if it's only you.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.014
Drive Tipp home.

19:02.182 --> 19:06.018
In the morning, tell him
he's rehired with a 50% raise.

19:06.186 --> 19:09.147
Give him that big office
across from the Seven Dwarfs.

19:09.314 --> 19:13.568
Set up a meeting with the other attorneys.
I'll be in early tomorrow.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.154
Earlier than usual.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.458
Hello, handsome.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.297
- I've come to wish you happy birthday.
- Oh, man!

19:36.758 --> 19:40.428
- I didn't invite you, Julie.
- That was a little weird.

19:40.596 --> 19:44.432
That's how it works with parties.
You have to be invited.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.100
Oh.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.229
I'm mad at you, you dick.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.274
We made love four times
the other night.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.737
- Was that good?
- Two's good.

19:58.488 --> 20:01.240
Three... is very good.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.160
- But four...
- Four's pretty good?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.495
Four is...

20:11.335 --> 20:13.419
Four is what?

20:14.838 --> 20:20.384
Hold me, I'll leave and you can go back
and talk to that cute brunette.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.969
Four is what?

20:22.137 --> 20:26.098
I don't want to meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.393
Four is what?

20:29.978 --> 20:32.063
She looks like a moth, David.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.817
- A moth?
- Sometimes I worry about you.

20:36.985 --> 20:42.156
Some clever girl in a silly coat will come
along and play you just the right way.

20:42.324 --> 20:47.995
I'll lose my friend and there won't be
chicken soup parties for me and you.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.510
OK.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.813
When will you call me?
Don't say "soon".

21:13.981 --> 21:16.857
I hate it when you say soon.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.739
So this is what's become
of rock and roll?

21:23.907 --> 21:29.203
A smashed guitar behind a glass case
displayed on some rich guy's wall.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.664
It was a gift, actually.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.545
- I like it.
- Whoa! Whoa!

21:37.713 --> 21:41.340
So how did you get all this stuff?
This apartment, this life?

21:46.513 --> 21:47.513
I see.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.356
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

21:57.524 --> 22:01.193
- You are, but the food's good.
- I've got a stalker.

22:01.361 --> 22:04.947
- It doesn't sound life-threatening.
- I need you to pretend

22:05.073 --> 22:09.410
we're having a scintillating conversation
and you are wildly entertained.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.163
- I know it's tough.
- I'll improvise.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.458
She's right across the room,
burning a hole in my back.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.669
- Red dress, strappy shoes?
- Yes.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.589
She's really staring at you.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.052
I'm having a drink.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.765
- Shit.
- She seems to be crying. Less happy.

22:32.768 --> 22:36.604
I think she's the saddest girl
to ever hold a Martini.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.735
- Brian Shelby.
- Jennifer Kelly.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.948
- You have another apartment?
- Sort of a day office.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.998
- I am not going in there.
- I am. Goodnight.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.527
- I hear her coming!
- Really?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.362
No.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.749
Brian. How are you?

23:40.710 --> 23:43.337
We're safe,
but I've got nothing to drink.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.006
Who did these paintings?

23:46.591 --> 23:50.094
This is Joni Mitchell,
this one is Monet...

23:50.720 --> 23:55.724
...and this one was done by me.
It is a snowboard.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.186
Well, two of them are geniuses.

24:01.606 --> 24:06.110
That is the real thing.
His paintbrush painted the vanilla sky.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.906
Canvas. My mother's.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.999
I'm surprised you're surprised.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.877
- I can't keep this going.
- Me neither.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.796
- I caught you.
- Brian, come in here.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.924
- What's going on?
- I'm drunk.

24:29.092 --> 24:32.511
- Julie Gianni is stalking me.
- She looked dangerous.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.805
Nobody stalks me so I drink.

24:34.973 --> 24:38.601
- We're out of drinks up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.352
- Stupid glass.
- I've got it.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.898
- It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry, no big deal.

24:44.024 --> 24:48.319
- I'll get us all something.
- I'd better hit it. I drank too much.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.779
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.866
- You are my guest of honour.
- Fuck you, David.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.869
You're paying me to write my novel,
so you own me.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.997
I don't own you. You are brilliant,
you are handsome.

25:00.123 --> 25:03.834
But why do you have to hit on Sofia?

25:04.920 --> 25:06.712
I wasn't hitting on Sofia.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.257
Fine, whatever you say.
I'm crazy, I'm blind.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.928
You're drinking Jack Daniels.
When you drink, you start with that...

25:14.930 --> 25:18.974
...Frank Sinatra, "she shot me down",
give me a cigarette thing.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.144
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- I'll find one.

25:22.312 --> 25:26.607
You're rich and women love you.
I'm from Ohio and I'm drunk.

25:26.816 --> 25:29.068
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.

25:29.236 --> 25:33.614
I dig her. I've never said this to you
before about any girl.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.783
But she could be...

25:35.951 --> 25:40.204
Could be, could be,
could be the girl of my dreams.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.957
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.544
But if she fucks up our friendship,
she can go to hell.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.296
I won't allow it.
We are brothers.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.590
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.

25:51.758 --> 25:52.967
Hey!

25:53.134 --> 25:55.261
How you doing?

25:55.428 --> 25:58.180
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:58.348 --> 26:04.061
- Where are you going?
- I am Frank... and Frank must go.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.983
- What?
- I good you bid evening.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.985
Wait, I'll go with you.

26:11.152 --> 26:14.321
- Stay, baby.
- I'll give you a ride home later.

26:14.489 --> 26:17.283
No, I have to work tomorrow.

26:17.450 --> 26:20.744
You... are in great hands.

26:20.996 --> 26:24.915
I'm just humouring myself
that my opinion matters.

26:29.838 --> 26:33.340
You will never know the exquisite pain

26:34.092 --> 26:36.969
of the guy who goes home alone.

26:37.137 --> 26:41.724
Because without the bitter, baby,
the sweet ain't as sweet.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.768
Have a good time.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.190
Sweet and sour speech again.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.998
A lot of people are scared of heights.

27:06.166 --> 27:11.211
It's not the heights that bother me,
it's the impact that terrifies me.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.429
- I won't stay long.
- Hey, Paolo!

27:22.849 --> 27:26.352
Hello. I have to take you for a walk.

27:26.853 --> 27:30.606
I need protection.
This is a lethal canine.

27:30.815 --> 27:34.360
I love living here
and I refuse to clean up.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.528
No problem.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.823
I have to work around the clock
to keep this place.

27:39.991 --> 27:43.035
- You really are a dancer.
- For 14 years.

27:43.203 --> 27:46.121
But I don't dance like you dance.

27:46.998 --> 27:50.542
- Do you want something to drink?
- Sure.

27:53.046 --> 27:57.257
Hey, Paolo.
Beautiful, beautiful boy.

27:58.093 --> 28:02.054
What do you want for dinner tonight?
You want fried chicken?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.977
Paulo!

28:11.981 --> 28:16.402
- I like your life.
- It's mine and you can't have it.

28:19.114 --> 28:24.034
I don't want to know the story
behind this photo. Who's Sergio?

28:24.202 --> 28:27.496
- It's a nickname.
- Your nickname is Sergio?

28:27.664 --> 28:30.290
It's a long story,
and we don't know each other.

28:32.627 --> 28:35.546
- So many secrets.
- I'm really an arms dealer.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.133
- I've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.927
What about you?
What's your nickname?

28:47.684 --> 28:49.643
Citizen Dildo.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.398
You are not staying over.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.281
Never run a company.
Stay an artist. Stay an arms dealer.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.993
Please. Somehow I can't play
the violin for you.

29:06.119 --> 29:10.956
Although it must be difficult
controlling all those people's lives.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.544
Everyone at that party is connected
to you for survival.

29:16.796 --> 29:18.756
It seems.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.552
Ever been married?

29:25.930 --> 29:29.850
No. Did you ever accept
any of your 12,000 proposals?

29:30.018 --> 29:32.478
12,008. No.

29:32.645 --> 29:35.773
You moved to New York to dance,
paint, act and deal arms?

29:35.940 --> 29:41.570
Right. Do you want to hear
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?

29:41.780 --> 29:46.700
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?
Both. Simultaneously.

29:48.995 --> 29:53.791
Everyone said: "Don't go to New York."
But I think good things will happen

29:53.958 --> 29:58.086
if you're a good person
with a good attitude. Don't you think?

30:01.925 --> 30:06.512
- You think I'm naive.
- No, I really don't.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.973
I dug her completely.

30:10.141 --> 30:14.561
Somehow, I'd found the last
semi-guileless girl in New York City.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.481
I have to get to sleep.

30:18.316 --> 30:22.277
Truthfully, I'm also working mornings
as a dental assistant.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.740
Boy, am I going
to the wrong dentist.

30:27.867 --> 30:31.203
You didn't immediately
want to sleep with her?

30:31.371 --> 30:34.498
Well, you know,
I'm a pleasure delayer.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.546
- How does that work?
- Pleasure delay? You don't know?

30:42.465 --> 30:47.845
You keep a relationship casual
until the absolute breaking point.

30:48.805 --> 30:52.766
Then one evening, or afternoon,
or morning...

30:53.810 --> 30:56.728
it could be months from now.

30:57.522 --> 31:01.733
- You know how it works.
- No, actually I don't.

31:03.361 --> 31:08.615
- I've been married for 22 years.
- You've got dinner with your daughters.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.827
That's right, I do.

31:11.995 --> 31:16.790
Back then I had intricate systems
with women you wouldn't believe.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.712
Like... what?

31:23.214 --> 31:26.675
Hey, Doc.
Don't get all melancholy

31:26.843 --> 31:30.888
over the 30 seconds
you were single a long time ago.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.515
- That's what you think I'm doing?
- Yes.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.060
You might be right.

31:37.645 --> 31:41.440
Let's continue.
Time is not our friend.

32:13.431 --> 32:17.517
Just our shortcomings.
That's all we're allowed to draw.

32:19.103 --> 32:22.230
I've never drawn
such a true likeness before.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.819
- Mine's finished.
- Already?

32:34.285 --> 32:36.119
Done.

32:39.165 --> 32:42.167
- That's how you see me?
- Maybe I didn't add enough money.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.837
It's something you'd see on a wall
in a steak house in hell.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.882
It's wonderful. Sign it.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.599
- Let's see yours.
- No.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.769
Give me that.

33:13.157 --> 33:17.536
I feel bad.
You said to draw a caricature.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.999
I know. I couldn't.
I saw you like that.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.255
It's very good.

33:30.091 --> 33:33.760
- I'll sell it to you.
- You monster.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.180
How much for?

33:39.475 --> 33:41.018
One kiss.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.735
That smile's going to be
the end of me.

33:51.821 --> 33:55.574
What happens when your friend
calls you tomorrow?

33:57.368 --> 34:01.538
He just met you a few hours before me.
He'd do the same.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.792
- I see that friendship is important to you.
- It is.

34:05.960 --> 34:09.254
And as his best friend,

34:09.922 --> 34:13.925
I know he's finishing a novel
about inadequacy and rejection,

34:14.093 --> 34:18.346
so the longer I stay,
the better it is for his career.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.184
Your career is the one I'd worry about.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.485
Sorry.

34:31.694 --> 34:34.654
You're more right than you even know.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.909
I used to be one of those guys that just...

34:39.702 --> 34:42.954
...was snowboarding through his life,

34:43.414 --> 34:47.250
with no focus whatsoever.

34:48.169 --> 34:51.713
- When did you change?
- About five minutes ago.

34:52.548 --> 34:56.676
Every passing minute
is another chance to turn it all around.

35:03.726 --> 35:07.395
And to those who think
that you're a charlatan?

35:07.522 --> 35:14.111
I understand. A frozen head waiting
for reanimation sounds like science fiction.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.113
What are you watching?

35:16.280 --> 35:20.200
It's the greatest show.
It's called "Sofia".

35:20.368 --> 35:24.079
It's a new science: Life Extension.

35:24.247 --> 35:27.582
How do you accomplish such a thing?

35:27.750 --> 35:30.377
I've seen this 30 times.

35:30.545 --> 35:33.964
Life is full of surprises,
but the greatest surprise of all

35:34.173 --> 35:37.175
is that this doesn't have to end... ever.

35:37.343 --> 35:40.095
We did a story on this guy.
He owns half of Arizona.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.431
- Is he a fraud?
- How would you ever know?

35:43.599 --> 35:45.433
Good point.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.936
Can you unfreeze a human life?

35:48.062 --> 35:51.064
Take the case of Benny the dog.

35:51.232 --> 35:55.110
He was frozen for three months
and thawed out to live a normal life.

35:55.278 --> 35:59.489
That's comforting.
It's safe for Benny.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.992
I'm in.

36:04.453 --> 36:07.372
Boy will still meet girl,
they will still fall in love.

36:07.540 --> 36:12.294
Families will flourish,
but man will meet his mind.

36:14.922 --> 36:17.799
We'd better watch out.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.554
Raymond Tooley,
creator of Life Extension.

36:22.722 --> 36:26.016
The book is "Life, The Sequel".

36:28.144 --> 36:29.644
OK.

36:33.733 --> 36:37.194
- Where are you going?
- I left my number on your fridge.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.405
Come here.
I want to tell you a secret.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.138
I meant that to be your forehead.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.103
Thank you for the inspiration.

37:13.564 --> 37:17.400
I will now attempt to run my company
showing compassion

37:17.568 --> 37:23.114
for the seething throng of my partners,
who root quietly for me to fail.

37:23.282 --> 37:27.369
And for things you don't even know.
Thank you.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.374
I'm going to work.
I have a company to run.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.837
Pleasure delayer.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.625
David Aames.

38:17.878 --> 38:20.380
- Julie Gianni.
- Hey, handsome.

38:21.048 --> 38:25.176
- You're following me.
- Just a little bit.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.637
I wanted to finish
what we were talking about.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.347
And?

38:30.266 --> 38:35.061
How did it go with our moth girl?
Did she turn into a butterfly for you?

38:36.355 --> 38:38.356
Yes, she did.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.192
She did.

38:43.654 --> 38:47.991
I could tell by the way you were walking
you didn't sleep with her.

38:48.784 --> 38:52.287
Let me guess. You haven't slept
with her because

38:52.496 --> 38:56.416
it's more fun when you draw it out.
Sex just isn't as good

38:56.584 --> 39:01.379
if a woman hasn't told her friends
she'd never sleep with you.

39:01.547 --> 39:04.257
You're right on the money, Julie.

39:04.425 --> 39:09.012
She must be exhausted from trying
to be witty for you all night long.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.558
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

39:14.935 --> 39:18.438
You're never there for your friends
until they've given up on you.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.738
I'm not blowing you off.
I just...

39:27.990 --> 39:30.867
I want to be alone for a little bit.
Trust me.

39:30.993 --> 39:33.828
I have a lot of things to take care of.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.373
If we're friends, which we are,

39:37.708 --> 39:39.959
then you'll understand that.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.796
I'm sorry. I got weird.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.549
I missed an audition

39:46.717 --> 39:50.887
and it made me feel bad
you didn't invite me to your party.

39:57.186 --> 40:00.897
You want to make it up to me?
I won't tell a soul.

40:21.043 --> 40:24.379
Would you do a story on me
if I made a CD?

40:33.097 --> 40:35.557
Do you like my music?

40:36.767 --> 40:38.643
It's vivid.

40:42.982 --> 40:46.359
If I weren't me,
I would buy a CD by me.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.988
You know,
if you can reach one person...

40:50.906 --> 40:52.449
Wow.

40:58.330 --> 41:01.624
What's happiness to you, David?

41:01.792 --> 41:04.210
What's happiness to me?

41:06.088 --> 41:08.548
- What is happiness?
- For me...

41:10.301 --> 41:12.552
...this is happiness.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.846
It's being with you.

41:19.977 --> 41:23.021
There's one thing that bothers me.

41:23.189 --> 41:27.775
Why did you tell Brian
that I was your... fuck buddy?

41:28.736 --> 41:31.738
I didn't tell him that.
I didn't say that.

41:32.907 --> 41:37.202
- When did you stop caring, David?
- Caring about what?

41:37.369 --> 41:40.705
About the consequences
of the promises that you've made.

41:41.832 --> 41:44.334
- Promises?
- Yes, the promises.

41:45.794 --> 41:48.213
I thought...

41:48.464 --> 41:50.965
What are you talking about?

41:51.133 --> 41:55.303
Do you understand how hard it is
to pretend to be your buddy?

41:55.471 --> 42:00.016
David, I love you.
I fucking love you.

42:01.268 --> 42:04.187
I fucking love you!
Fuck!

42:07.274 --> 42:09.317
Don't do this, don't do this.

42:09.485 --> 42:12.612
You fucked me four times
the other night, David.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.949
You've been inside me,
I've swallowed your cum.

42:16.075 --> 42:18.493
That means something.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.830
Slow down.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.291
Four times.
It means something, David.

42:25.459 --> 42:27.418
- Four times.
- Stop the car.

42:27.586 --> 42:30.588
24 hours a day,
I live with this aching possibility

42:30.756 --> 42:33.174
that you might call me
to do something.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.843
Let's go to your house
and we'll talk this out.

42:36.679 --> 42:40.014
Let's just slow down.
Will you stop the car, Julie!

42:40.182 --> 42:42.141
When you sleep with someone,

42:42.309 --> 42:46.104
your body makes a promise,
whether you do or not.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.568
Tell me something, David.
Do you believe in God?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.616
What are you doing?

43:00.452 --> 43:02.870
I love you. I love you.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.725
Hello.

44:07.353 --> 44:10.813
You're amazing.

44:11.273 --> 44:13.816
Did you get to work all right?

44:14.943 --> 44:16.527
Yeah.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.905
No, actually...

44:19.031 --> 44:21.074
I had a horrible dream.

44:21.283 --> 44:24.035
You dreamed
you'd never see me again.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.746
I left your apartment,
I went downstairs to the car

44:26.914 --> 44:30.333
and my friend, the stalker,
had followed me there.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.002
- Julie?
- Yes.

44:33.212 --> 44:38.299
She wanted to talk to me.
I remember I had this buzz,

44:38.634 --> 44:42.011
that buzz from you and me.

44:42.179 --> 44:47.558
I think my mind was still
on that terrible drawing of me.

44:49.436 --> 44:52.355
But she was upset.

44:53.565 --> 44:56.984
I don't know.
I got in the car...

44:57.861 --> 45:00.697
...and she drove off a bridge

45:00.864 --> 45:04.158
and committed suicide
with me in the car.

45:04.326 --> 45:07.328
I thought you were going
straight to work.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.835
But I survive...

45:13.961 --> 45:16.421
with my arm...

45:16.588 --> 45:20.675
and my face reconstructed.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.303
And what's worse...

45:24.471 --> 45:28.224
I can't wake up.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.210
How was your house after the party?

45:58.172 --> 46:00.089
Party?

46:01.341 --> 46:04.177
- What party?
- The party.

46:07.514 --> 46:09.515
Remember?

46:09.975 --> 46:12.643
Red dress, strappy shoes.

46:14.354 --> 46:17.732
I spilled something on your shirt.

46:18.233 --> 46:20.485
Sweet and sour,

46:21.445 --> 46:25.072
and the saddest girl
to ever hold a Martini.

46:48.138 --> 46:50.598
My dreams are a cruel joke.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.353
They taunt me.

47:03.445 --> 47:05.029
Even in my dreams,

47:05.197 --> 47:09.200
I'm an idiot who knows
he's about to wake up to reality.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.996
If I could only avoid sleep...

47:15.999 --> 47:17.959
...but I can't.

47:18.627 --> 47:23.005
I try to tell myself what to dream.
I try to dream that I'm flying.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.133
Something free.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.973
It never works.

47:37.938 --> 47:40.648
Is that the only thing you dream?

47:43.151 --> 47:45.778
I don't remember.

47:51.493 --> 47:54.412
Do you dream about the car accident?

47:54.580 --> 47:58.791
Here's what you remember
from a coma - nothing.

48:03.422 --> 48:07.425
- What happened next?
- What really happened?

48:09.177 --> 48:14.307
Didn't you read the file?
I was out for three and a half weeks.

48:14.474 --> 48:18.060
My face and arm shattered,
my jaw broken in four places.

48:19.438 --> 48:22.899
No surgery could be performed
because of the coma.

48:24.192 --> 48:28.154
You can't feel the darkness
or numbness.

48:29.698 --> 48:32.116
You can't even feel.

48:32.534 --> 48:36.162
And then,
I came back to life.

48:38.999 --> 48:43.419
Just like that dog, Benny.
Benny the dog.

48:44.546 --> 48:46.797
Benny. Benny the dog.

48:46.965 --> 48:49.967
Only my life was no longer enjoyable.

48:51.011 --> 48:55.806
There are blinding migraines now.
Nerve damage. Why?

48:55.974 --> 49:00.019
This is how big business operates.

49:00.187 --> 49:04.482
Random accidents,
a lifestyle mishap.

49:04.650 --> 49:06.859
They are not coincidences.

49:06.985 --> 49:11.155
How do you think
airtight contracts are broken?

49:11.323 --> 49:14.742
These are power upheavals.

49:14.910 --> 49:19.538
I'm from Ohio.
We don't have power upheavals.

49:19.706 --> 49:23.417
They're in the news every day,
right between the lines.

49:24.878 --> 49:26.837
Someone did this to me.

49:28.298 --> 49:30.675
My father wrote about this in his book.

49:30.842 --> 49:34.387
Chapter one, page one,
paragraph one.

49:35.013 --> 49:38.641
"What is the answer
to 99 out of 100 questions?

49:40.477 --> 49:41.852
"Money."

49:41.979 --> 49:44.230
David, I don't want to worry you.

49:44.398 --> 49:47.400
I'm holding them off,
but we've got a situation here.

49:47.567 --> 49:50.987
The bye-laws of the board
protect your 51% vote

49:51.113 --> 49:53.322
only if you're mentally acute.

49:53.532 --> 49:55.700
I'm sorry that poor girl died,

49:55.867 --> 49:59.036
but you've handed the board
a gift with your mishap.

49:59.204 --> 50:02.748
They'd like to declare you incapacitated.

50:02.916 --> 50:05.376
But you're back.

50:05.544 --> 50:09.380
You sound good to me,
so let's fight the fuckers

50:09.548 --> 50:13.759
and have a full recovery.
Maybe you should let people see you.

50:13.927 --> 50:17.013
The last time we were together,
you were in a coma

50:17.180 --> 50:21.726
and you were very fucking rude to me.
You didn't say a word.

50:22.227 --> 50:27.023
The rumours of my death
have been mildly exaggerated.

50:30.652 --> 50:35.531
Who could I trust?
The ants were taking over the ant hill.

50:37.659 --> 50:39.785
Who could I trust?

51:40.722 --> 51:43.974
The cranial structure
was based on 30 pins,

51:44.142 --> 51:47.520
and fastened by micro panels
and bone from the mandible.

51:47.687 --> 51:50.564
The grafts have maintained
your cheek structure.

51:50.774 --> 51:53.150
Unfortunately, as you were in a coma...

51:53.318 --> 51:56.946
Doctors. Their power is in jargon,
so you study up.

51:57.072 --> 52:00.157
Is that the procedure
for all bilateral haematomas

52:00.325 --> 52:03.202
in a LeFort III fracture
of a comatose patient?

52:03.370 --> 52:05.121
You do your best.

52:05.288 --> 52:08.749
The potential for intra-cranial
brain damage was too great.

52:08.917 --> 52:10.584
Beyond the cheek grafts,

52:10.752 --> 52:13.629
are the pins fastened
with any kind of aluminium

52:13.797 --> 52:16.757
which could cause the pressure
in my head?

52:16.925 --> 52:18.884
We're working on prostheses,

52:19.052 --> 52:22.805
but you're not at the stage
where we can experiment.

52:24.432 --> 52:26.350
Experiment. Use me.

52:26.560 --> 52:30.855
- The headaches will go away.
- These are more than headaches.

52:31.690 --> 52:35.693
These are like steel plates
slicing through my every thought.

52:35.861 --> 52:38.028
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.

52:38.989 --> 52:41.407
I can't think straight most of the time.

52:41.616 --> 52:45.578
- We can increase your medication.
- Yes. Medication.

52:46.621 --> 52:51.041
We'll continue to investigate.
However, there are so many others

52:51.251 --> 52:55.671
who have not had the aesthetic benefit
of plastic surgery as you have.

52:56.339 --> 52:59.466
This isn't about vanity,
Dr Pomerantz.

52:59.634 --> 53:03.345
This isn't about vanity.
This is about functioning in the world.

53:03.513 --> 53:06.515
It's my job to be out there functioning.

53:06.683 --> 53:09.226
I've got the money.
I'll pay any amount.

53:10.520 --> 53:14.023
Just invent something!
Just play jazz.

53:14.232 --> 53:18.235
You say you're the best face man
in New York? Prove it!

53:22.032 --> 53:25.451
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!

53:29.748 --> 53:32.666
Nobody here takes your feelings
for granted.

53:32.834 --> 53:36.212
We prepared something
based on the preliminary examination.

53:36.379 --> 53:37.838
Bring it on!

53:37.964 --> 53:41.592
It's sometimes useful
in the early stages of rejection.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.720
It's a facial prosthetic.
It was two weeks in the making.

53:44.888 --> 53:47.348
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.

53:57.317 --> 54:01.111
- A facial prosthetic?
- The aesthetic replacement does work.

54:01.279 --> 54:03.989
Emotionally and actually.

54:04.157 --> 54:07.117
The plastic in the shield
blocks out abusive rays

54:07.285 --> 54:10.621
and assists in the regeneration of cells.

54:11.581 --> 54:15.542
- It's an aesthetic regenerative shield?
- That's correct.

54:15.710 --> 54:18.837
The ergonomics of the plate barrier
allows it to interact

54:18.964 --> 54:22.591
- with the movements of your face.
- I see.

54:23.260 --> 54:26.428
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.

54:26.596 --> 54:29.390
For a minute there,
I thought we were talking about

54:29.557 --> 54:31.684
a fucking mask!

54:33.561 --> 54:37.147
It's only a mask
if you treat it that way.

54:37.315 --> 54:41.402
No, it's great. This completely
takes care of Halloween.

54:43.863 --> 54:48.492
But what about the other 364 days
of the year?

55:02.632 --> 55:05.634
A new form of me began to take shape.

55:05.802 --> 55:11.223
I planned my re-emergence
like the Normandy invasion.

55:13.393 --> 55:15.019
Sofia. Sofia.

55:15.186 --> 55:17.896
So-fi-a... Serrano.

55:18.982 --> 55:20.899
I'll just say it.

55:21.026 --> 55:24.862
I did my homework.
I read every memo.

55:26.031 --> 55:30.367
Thomas Tipp was right -
people will read again.

55:31.870 --> 55:35.372
I attended the monthly meeting
of the Seven Dwarfs by video.

55:35.540 --> 55:38.959
People aren't buying books!
Let's invest.

55:39.127 --> 55:41.754
Oh, baby. This was war.

55:42.672 --> 55:45.215
I grew stronger in ways
I'd never known

55:45.383 --> 55:49.887
and on December 5th,
my planes filled the sky.

55:50.055 --> 55:54.683
The return of David Aames, Jr.
Citizen Dildo.

56:07.447 --> 56:09.615
Did you see his face?

56:33.848 --> 56:37.059
You won't believe this...

56:39.562 --> 56:42.815
...but this is me smiling.

56:48.947 --> 56:50.697
It's been a long time.

56:50.865 --> 56:54.368
I tried to see you,
but your people wouldn't let me.

56:54.577 --> 56:57.162
I didn't want to see me, OK?

56:57.956 --> 57:02.376
But then I woke up today,
and finally...

57:03.378 --> 57:05.045
...a good hair day.

57:09.050 --> 57:10.717
You want to get together?

57:13.555 --> 57:14.555
Sure.

57:16.599 --> 57:19.268
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.

57:19.436 --> 57:23.480
This weekend.
I'll cancel an operation or two.

57:24.065 --> 57:25.983
We'll have fun.

57:26.151 --> 57:29.987
Because I am all about fun.

57:33.032 --> 57:36.577
Our first guest tonight
is an amazing survival story.

57:36.744 --> 57:38.871
Please welcome Benny the dog!

57:44.544 --> 57:47.296
Welcome to the show, Gary.

57:47.464 --> 57:49.423
I have so many questions.

57:49.591 --> 57:54.178
Tell us what has happened to Benny?
What's Benny been through?

57:55.138 --> 57:57.973
Benny fell into the water near our home

57:58.141 --> 58:02.436
- and was frozen in the Skykomish river.
- In Washington.

58:02.604 --> 58:06.315
I went fishing, thinking he'd been
gone for three months,

58:06.483 --> 58:09.735
and I see him in a block of ice.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.821
He is thawed out now, is that correct?

58:12.989 --> 58:16.325
He's not moving a lot. I'm worried.

58:16.534 --> 58:19.077
I'm worried about the dog.

58:19.245 --> 58:22.789
He's fine. He's just lost
a little of his friskiness.

58:23.416 --> 58:25.417
Sofia? It's David.

58:26.294 --> 58:30.297
I'm back in your life.
I saw you earlier today.

58:30.465 --> 58:36.220
I was just watching our old friend
Benny the dog on "Conan"

58:37.764 --> 58:40.474
and I thought of you.

58:40.808 --> 58:43.101
Whatever. I...

58:44.479 --> 58:46.855
...I loved seeing you today.

58:47.649 --> 58:50.317
So I will see you soon.

58:51.653 --> 58:53.904
You're a great dancer.

59:46.916 --> 59:49.626
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.

59:49.794 --> 59:52.921
I'm in the mood for a cheap,
overpriced rum and Coke.

59:53.047 --> 59:55.090
- Do you want one?
- Is there any other kind?

59:55.258 --> 59:58.844
- I'll get us some.
- Where is the bathroom?

59:59.304 --> 1:00:01.305
It's behind...

1:00:01.472 --> 1:00:05.559
Over there,
by the girl who looks like Björk.

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:08.437
- I'll be right back.
- Maybe I should...

1:00:10.189 --> 1:00:12.816
You look good.
How's your book?

1:00:13.234 --> 1:00:16.111
- Take it off.
- This is a facial shield.

1:00:16.279 --> 1:00:19.615
It's kind of like a prosthesis.

1:00:19.782 --> 1:00:22.075
Take off the mask.
It's freaking me out.

1:00:22.243 --> 1:00:24.161
I can't.

1:00:24.787 --> 1:00:27.581
It's my face. This is my face.

1:00:27.749 --> 1:00:30.042
Trust me, it's a little different.

1:00:30.251 --> 1:00:34.421
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.

1:00:34.589 --> 1:00:36.381
Sofia asked me.

1:00:36.549 --> 1:00:39.301
She didn't want to be alone with me?
That's bullshit!

1:00:39.469 --> 1:00:42.304
I'm being pretty cool
about this whole thing.

1:00:42.472 --> 1:00:46.058
Talk to a shrink. Or are you going
to call me sometime

1:00:46.225 --> 1:00:48.310
instead of hiding in your apartment?

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:51.897
Don't take it out on a girl
you only met once.

1:00:52.023 --> 1:00:55.108
Did she say that? Once?

1:00:55.276 --> 1:00:57.194
She said I met her once?

1:00:57.362 --> 1:01:00.781
Just cut it out.
I miss the old you.

1:01:01.866 --> 1:01:03.784
We all miss the old you.

1:01:03.951 --> 1:01:06.578
Because the new guy is shit.

1:01:08.915 --> 1:01:12.376
That came out wrong.
I love you. Period.

1:01:13.086 --> 1:01:16.296
- How's your arm, man?
- Fuck you, Brian.

1:01:16.464 --> 1:01:22.260
How about no sympathy?
How about that's the deal we make?

1:01:33.773 --> 1:01:36.525
Give me a Budweiser
and a shot of tequila.

1:01:36.734 --> 1:01:38.485
What kind of tequila?

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:43.949
- What did you say to me?
- I said "What kind of tequila?"

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:48.620
Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch?

1:01:51.958 --> 1:01:54.084
Patron, if you have it.

1:02:23.197 --> 1:02:26.283
- Another shot, another Bud.
- This is on the house.

1:02:26.492 --> 1:02:30.620
- Why?
- It just is... bitch.

1:03:21.672 --> 1:03:23.673
Patron!

1:03:32.558 --> 1:03:35.143
Fix your fucking face!

1:04:26.988 --> 1:04:29.281
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:32.492
Idea - let's start over.

1:04:33.953 --> 1:04:37.455
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

1:04:37.623 --> 1:04:39.833
"You are, but the food is good."

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:43.545
I've got this little problem.
I've got a stalker.

1:04:45.298 --> 1:04:47.674
"It doesn't sound life-threatening."

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:51.469
I need you to pretend we're having
a scintillating conversation

1:04:51.637 --> 1:04:55.724
and you are wildly entertained.
I know it's tough.

1:04:56.684 --> 1:04:59.561
- "I'll improvise."
- I don't talk like that.

1:05:00.771 --> 1:05:04.357
She's right across the room,
burning a hole in my back.

1:05:08.237 --> 1:05:10.864
Red dress, strappy shoes.

1:05:14.076 --> 1:05:16.036
That's right.

1:05:17.496 --> 1:05:21.917
I think she is the saddest girl
to ever hold a Martini.

1:05:35.598 --> 1:05:37.766
- Are you OK?
- No.

1:05:38.517 --> 1:05:40.685
What's wrong?
Is it me?

1:05:41.979 --> 1:05:43.813
- Is it me?
- I'll tell you later.

1:05:43.981 --> 1:05:47.067
Tell me now. If something's wrong,
please tell me now.

1:05:47.234 --> 1:05:51.112
- Just talk about everything.
- I'll tell you later!

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:53.907
Let's get it all out.
Say everything now.

1:05:54.033 --> 1:05:57.619
Just say everything.
Say everything now, now, now.

1:05:57.787 --> 1:06:01.623
I'll tell you in another life
when we are both cats.

1:06:07.296 --> 1:06:10.340
I can't believe you just said that.

1:06:12.635 --> 1:06:15.178
That's the greatest thing
I've ever heard.

1:06:15.346 --> 1:06:18.223
That's hilarious.
That you said that.

1:06:18.975 --> 1:06:21.726
That's... You said that.
You said that.

1:06:21.936 --> 1:06:25.313
That is what I love about you.

1:06:26.357 --> 1:06:28.817
That's hilarious.

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:32.320
I'll tell you in another life
when we are both cats.

1:06:33.781 --> 1:06:35.907
Cats! Cats!

1:06:41.956 --> 1:06:45.583
- This is where I leave you.
- I'll walk you to your door.

1:06:45.751 --> 1:06:48.628
- I live just around the corner.
- I've got my bike.

1:06:48.796 --> 1:06:50.797
- I'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.

1:06:50.965 --> 1:06:53.591
Can't you see she wants
to go on her own?

1:06:53.759 --> 1:06:56.177
Shut up, you're drunk.

1:06:56.345 --> 1:06:59.514
I may be an idiot, but I'm not drunk.

1:06:59.682 --> 1:07:04.019
Seriously, I don't need you
to walk me home. Thank you.

1:07:05.062 --> 1:07:06.980
OK, then, so...

1:07:07.481 --> 1:07:09.524
...we'll call you.

1:07:09.734 --> 1:07:12.736
We'll go catch a movie or something.

1:07:13.988 --> 1:07:15.780
So we'll meet up soon.

1:07:19.285 --> 1:07:20.952
We'll meet up soon.

1:07:30.963 --> 1:07:34.132
We'll call you again to go out with me.

1:07:35.051 --> 1:07:37.302
We'll call you.

1:07:37.595 --> 1:07:41.139
It's been a real blast, David.
I bid you good evening.

1:07:41.307 --> 1:07:43.308
Wait, where are you going?

1:07:43.476 --> 1:07:46.394
My bike is back over there.
We'll hang soon.

1:07:46.562 --> 1:07:49.606
Bring your mask if you want.
I'm getting used to it.

1:07:51.859 --> 1:07:54.360
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1:07:57.073 --> 1:07:58.782
I don't know.

1:07:58.949 --> 1:08:01.951
You drank too much.
Call me tomorrow.

1:08:02.078 --> 1:08:04.829
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.

1:08:07.291 --> 1:08:10.001
No, you won't.
You just need to sleep.

1:08:12.838 --> 1:08:15.799
- Hey. Hey!
- What?

1:08:21.138 --> 1:08:25.391
What did you say to Julie Gianni
the night of the accident?

1:08:25.559 --> 1:08:32.273
- What?
- You told her she was a fuck buddy.

1:08:33.192 --> 1:08:35.026
Never.

1:08:35.194 --> 1:08:38.446
She was a little more than pissed about it.

1:08:39.198 --> 1:08:42.200
Have you been harbouring
this shit all along?

1:08:42.368 --> 1:08:44.994
I never talked to her.

1:08:48.707 --> 1:08:50.708
Whatever.

1:08:52.461 --> 1:08:57.382
Anyway, who am I if I can't be the one
to tell you you're not ugly?

1:08:58.843 --> 1:09:02.554
Come on!
Give me a courtesy laugh!

1:09:03.639 --> 1:09:08.560
Brian, I'm so fucked up.
I'm just so fucked up!

1:09:15.943 --> 1:09:20.071
We're best friends!
We're bro's!

1:09:20.239 --> 1:09:23.283
Come on, man. We're bro's.

1:11:04.385 --> 1:11:06.719
Open your eyes.

1:11:10.557 --> 1:11:11.766
Boo!

1:11:12.851 --> 1:11:18.231
- This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
- I'm OK. I'm OK.

1:11:18.399 --> 1:11:21.150
And it worked. Get up.

1:11:21.986 --> 1:11:23.403
I agree.

1:11:26.407 --> 1:11:28.533
This is a joke.

1:11:28.701 --> 1:11:31.494
David, I'm not going to lie to you.

1:11:31.662 --> 1:11:34.831
I liked the way you looked. But...

1:11:35.791 --> 1:11:38.960
...you have to pull it the fuck together.

1:11:39.169 --> 1:11:41.921
If not, I'll forget the other guy.

1:11:42.089 --> 1:11:45.591
You know that other guy? You?

1:11:46.593 --> 1:11:49.387
I'm still that guy.

1:11:49.555 --> 1:11:54.684
I don't have a mother saviour bone
in my body. it's not about that.

1:11:54.893 --> 1:11:59.188
You are coming inside,
but if this turns out to be a big mistake...

1:12:00.024 --> 1:12:04.986
...I do have the ability to fall
out of love with you like that.

1:12:15.748 --> 1:12:18.624
We created our own world together.

1:12:18.834 --> 1:12:21.252
US versus them.

1:12:21.420 --> 1:12:25.923
- Where's Brian?
- Brian? He went with you, didn't he?

1:12:26.592 --> 1:12:29.135
I thought you guys hooked up.

1:12:30.346 --> 1:12:34.015
I wish you hadn't got in the car
with that girl.

1:12:36.143 --> 1:12:38.311
Sofia, I...

1:12:41.482 --> 1:12:44.067
Your eyes apologise better.

1:12:45.819 --> 1:12:47.904
Come on.

1:12:48.364 --> 1:12:53.910
Holy God! This is going to change
my life in a zillion different ways.

1:12:54.620 --> 1:12:56.371
I must be nuts!

1:12:56.538 --> 1:12:58.581
We were quite a pair.

1:12:58.749 --> 1:13:04.379
Her believing in me, me believing
that I actually deserved it.

1:13:19.603 --> 1:13:21.437
Ah, Sofia.

1:13:23.023 --> 1:13:26.025
I see you haven't been wasting your time.

1:13:26.485 --> 1:13:30.988
- Do you ever draw anything else?
- No.

1:13:31.907 --> 1:13:33.741
Did you sleep last night?

1:13:34.284 --> 1:13:35.952
I love you.

1:13:36.537 --> 1:13:38.204
No, I did not sleep.

1:13:38.414 --> 1:13:42.250
Got to leave early today, David,
so you'll have to be brief.

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:47.171
What can you tell me
about the name Ellie?

1:13:49.550 --> 1:13:51.050
Ellie.

1:13:51.218 --> 1:13:53.970
Was that a girl you were
in love with?

1:13:54.096 --> 1:13:56.222
I've only been in love once.

1:13:56.390 --> 1:13:59.684
Apparently you kept repeating it last night.

1:13:59.893 --> 1:14:03.813
You did sleep, David.
Your advisor said you cried out.

1:14:03.981 --> 1:14:06.774
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.

1:14:06.942 --> 1:14:10.653
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?

1:14:13.490 --> 1:14:16.117
I... I don't...

1:14:17.453 --> 1:14:20.997
Dig deep, David. Dig deep.

1:14:21.123 --> 1:14:25.460
You cried out for Ellie.
What do you remember about Ellie?

1:14:26.962 --> 1:14:29.380
Show me your face, David.

1:14:31.049 --> 1:14:33.801
Help me open the door.

1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:47.565
It's true you had an accident,
it's true you were disfigured.

1:14:47.774 --> 1:14:49.901
But not any more.

1:14:50.319 --> 1:14:52.487
Do you remember?

1:14:54.072 --> 1:14:56.991
They did fix your face.

1:14:58.535 --> 1:15:03.748
Take off that mask, David.
You'll see your face is perfect under there.

1:15:05.083 --> 1:15:07.960
I never trusted the doctors.

1:15:09.463 --> 1:15:12.590
What happened next was surreal.

1:15:13.675 --> 1:15:17.094
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr Pomerantz, called me

1:15:17.262 --> 1:15:19.722
and suddenly he was my new best friend.

1:15:19.932 --> 1:15:24.477
David! My brother! I felt really bad
about our last conversation.

1:15:24.645 --> 1:15:27.980
He'd discovered a new form
of reconstructive surgery

1:15:28.106 --> 1:15:30.441
with the help of a doctor from Berlin.

1:15:30.651 --> 1:15:31.817
Hello.

1:15:31.985 --> 1:15:35.947
Next thing I knew, they shot me
full of drugs I'd never heard of

1:15:36.073 --> 1:15:38.115
and away we went.

1:15:38.283 --> 1:15:42.370
What if God was one of us?

1:15:43.997 --> 1:15:47.792
Just a slob like one of us?

1:15:48.460 --> 1:15:51.003
Trying to make his way home...

1:15:51.213 --> 1:15:52.922
He's got a good voice.

1:15:55.133 --> 1:15:59.804
The odds were one in three
that the headaches would reduce by 50%

1:15:59.972 --> 1:16:03.307
and facial tissue could be regenerated.

1:16:03.475 --> 1:16:06.978
...the concept of endoscopic,
periorbital fibre optics.

1:16:07.145 --> 1:16:10.856
- Where are we eating later?
- I can't even tell you what they did.

1:16:10.983 --> 1:16:13.150
It seemed like science fiction.

1:16:13.318 --> 1:16:17.363
Madonna had that song "Borderline".
That was a hell of a song.

1:16:17.573 --> 1:16:20.825
This is going to be one good-looking guy
when I'm done.

1:16:20.993 --> 1:16:23.494
Obviously I was suspicious.

1:16:24.663 --> 1:16:29.125
- Wouldn't you be?
- Suspicious of whom? Of what?

1:16:29.835 --> 1:16:34.380
Doc, once you've been driven off
a bridge at 80 miles an hour,

1:16:34.923 --> 1:16:39.719
somehow you don't invite happiness
in without a full body search.

1:16:43.056 --> 1:16:47.643
At the risk of boring you,
I can present the alternate argument.

1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:53.065
I once knew a guy
who was a real loner.

1:16:54.484 --> 1:16:56.527
One day he woke up at 40

1:16:56.737 --> 1:16:59.989
with two daughters
that lit up his life with purpose.

1:17:00.115 --> 1:17:02.783
He suddenly goes to endless school plays,

1:17:02.951 --> 1:17:06.037
he gets home at 9:20
for the evening discussion

1:17:06.204 --> 1:17:09.081
and he has the time of his life.

1:17:09.958 --> 1:17:14.045
His favourite Beatle was once John
and now it's Paul.

1:17:16.548 --> 1:17:19.300
I always liked George.

1:17:20.218 --> 1:17:23.596
It all depends on the individual,
doesn't it?

1:17:23.764 --> 1:17:27.892
- Tell me, what's happiness for you?
- What's happiness to you, David?

1:17:29.519 --> 1:17:34.023
- How about another question?
- You won't show me your face, will you?

1:17:34.191 --> 1:17:39.570
So, back to the timeline.
Hurry, let's move through this.

1:17:39.780 --> 1:17:41.656
David!

1:17:43.241 --> 1:17:46.035
- David?
- What?

1:17:48.246 --> 1:17:52.625
- You've got to take the plates off.
- I don't want to know what's under here.

1:17:52.793 --> 1:17:54.960
It'll be fine, you'll see.

1:17:55.128 --> 1:17:58.464
I called Pomerantz
and switched it to Wednesday.

1:18:04.304 --> 1:18:05.971
What?

1:18:07.599 --> 1:18:11.268
I hope that women at the front desk
gave you shit about it.

1:18:12.646 --> 1:18:15.981
Another day won't matter,
and the Mustang will be fixed.

1:18:16.108 --> 1:18:19.276
The plan was going in the Mustang.
It's not ready.

1:18:19.444 --> 1:18:23.614
So we'll go tomorrow in the Mustang,
when it's fixed.

1:18:23.782 --> 1:18:25.825
I know that the problem

1:18:25.992 --> 1:18:29.954
wouldn't be you delaying something
you were dreading.

1:18:32.124 --> 1:18:35.584
- Couldn't be that.
- No, couldn't be that.

1:18:38.547 --> 1:18:40.423
I mean...

1:18:49.307 --> 1:18:52.017
I mean... I agree.

1:18:54.062 --> 1:18:57.690
I think it's very important to have...

1:19:00.610 --> 1:19:03.112
...the right car...

1:19:10.036 --> 1:19:11.787
...to take you...

1:19:13.999 --> 1:19:16.709
...where you want to go...

1:19:21.214 --> 1:19:23.299
...24 hours a day.

1:19:48.992 --> 1:19:50.993
How bad is it?

1:19:54.372 --> 1:19:58.209
Well, your ears are in the right place.

1:20:00.253 --> 1:20:02.797
And the rest of it...

1:20:05.091 --> 1:20:07.676
...is not too bad at all.

1:20:13.391 --> 1:20:15.059
It's perfect.

1:21:06.361 --> 1:21:09.530
Do you love me?
I mean really love me?

1:21:10.490 --> 1:21:14.785
Because if you don't,
I'll just have to kill you.

1:21:19.082 --> 1:21:21.083
In my next life...

1:21:21.293 --> 1:21:25.671
In my next life, I'm going to come back
as this mole right here.

1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:29.508
Seriously, this mole.

1:21:29.676 --> 1:21:35.472
You'll have to wear bikini tops
to work so that I can breathe.

1:21:36.308 --> 1:21:39.226
I love you.
Love you.

1:21:42.105 --> 1:21:44.064
I love you.

1:21:44.774 --> 1:21:47.401
I can live right there.

1:21:52.657 --> 1:21:54.825
Is this a dream?

1:21:55.660 --> 1:21:57.411
Absolutely.

1:22:08.131 --> 1:22:11.383
We talked about the big things,
the little things...

1:22:11.551 --> 1:22:13.761
...and the big things.

1:22:14.346 --> 1:22:18.432
But, in truth, with Sofia
it was the in-between times.

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:46.335
- What did she say?
- I have no idea.

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:51.966
- How's things, Brian?
- Fine.

1:22:52.801 --> 1:22:55.010
Brian, how's things?

1:22:55.178 --> 1:22:58.013
Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.

1:22:58.181 --> 1:23:01.809
Besides, Sofia is great,
but by no means one of a kind.

1:23:01.977 --> 1:23:04.937
She was a proximity infatuation.

1:23:06.064 --> 1:23:08.732
Don't use that, it's mine.

1:23:10.235 --> 1:23:12.194
Where did you get this camera?

1:23:12.362 --> 1:23:15.781
I'm into things you have no idea,
my friend.

1:23:17.242 --> 1:23:21.453
- Just so long as you're OK.
- Anyway, we're friends, aren't we?

1:23:21.746 --> 1:23:23.664
- Always.
- That's right.

1:23:36.469 --> 1:23:38.679
What's up with your face?

1:23:39.097 --> 1:23:40.681
Fuck!

1:23:40.890 --> 1:23:43.851
There's a seam opening or something!

1:23:49.232 --> 1:23:51.692
- David Aames.
- You fucking asshole.

1:23:52.610 --> 1:23:54.570
I know.

1:25:15.068 --> 1:25:17.277
Was I snoring?

1:25:18.780 --> 1:25:23.992
No. I think it was me.
I was thirsty, that's all.

1:25:27.956 --> 1:25:31.125
I'm dreaming about you. Mmm.

1:26:45.825 --> 1:26:50.329
I could listen to you say "mmm"
for the rest of my life.

1:27:03.509 --> 1:27:05.052
Baby, what's wrong?

1:27:10.475 --> 1:27:13.936
- Where is she?
- Who?

1:27:18.983 --> 1:27:20.025
Who?

1:27:46.844 --> 1:27:49.012
I'm Sofia.

1:27:53.142 --> 1:27:57.646
I'm going to make sure that I tie it
four times. You know why, Julie?

1:27:57.855 --> 1:28:00.899
Because four times
really means something.

1:28:01.025 --> 1:28:03.318
Please don't hurt me.

1:28:03.486 --> 1:28:06.071
I'm freaked out, it worked.

1:28:06.239 --> 1:28:11.118
You won't get away with this,
so just tell me where Sofia is.

1:28:11.286 --> 1:28:14.579
- I am Sofia.
- Where's Sofia?

1:28:14.747 --> 1:28:17.874
- I am Sofia!
- Where is she?

1:28:18.001 --> 1:28:20.502
I'm calling the police.
Tell it to them.

1:28:20.670 --> 1:28:24.131
You survived the accident.
Whose body was it?

1:28:24.299 --> 1:28:27.384
It was the board,
the Seven Dwarfs, wasn't it?

1:28:27.552 --> 1:28:31.471
You're trying to steal my life!
You weren't in an accident.

1:28:31.639 --> 1:28:34.099
Now it's attempted murder!

1:28:34.267 --> 1:28:36.560
I am Sofia, please!

1:28:38.062 --> 1:28:40.022
Tell it to them.

1:28:40.857 --> 1:28:43.900
This is David Aames.
I need help.

1:28:44.485 --> 1:28:48.238
I've captured an intruder
who's entered my home.

1:28:48.406 --> 1:28:50.198
Oh, God!

1:28:50.366 --> 1:28:54.369
Wake up man.
Are you for real?

1:29:04.964 --> 1:29:07.299
They've kept me here for three hours.

1:29:07.467 --> 1:29:10.719
They think that I had
something to do with this.

1:29:10.887 --> 1:29:13.889
Can you give us a minute here?

1:29:14.015 --> 1:29:16.224
Thanks very much.

1:29:18.770 --> 1:29:21.271
They think I had something
to do with this.

1:29:21.439 --> 1:29:24.900
We're going to handle this
the way your father would.

1:29:25.026 --> 1:29:28.779
- I've got it solved.
- You've got it solved?

1:29:29.405 --> 1:29:31.073
Where is she?

1:29:32.367 --> 1:29:35.994
She's going to be fine.
This whole file is going to...

1:29:39.624 --> 1:29:41.666
Thank God you're here.

1:29:42.251 --> 1:29:43.335
It's OK.

1:29:44.420 --> 1:29:46.296
I love her.

1:29:47.507 --> 1:29:50.884
Look at these photos,
then I'm going to destroy them.

1:29:51.052 --> 1:29:55.347
Sofia's testimony is also in here.
It won't exist.

1:29:56.557 --> 1:29:58.850
She's not going to press charges.

1:30:01.312 --> 1:30:06.316
- Press charges against me?
- David, wake up.

1:30:09.695 --> 1:30:11.696
As a friend...

1:30:12.323 --> 1:30:16.535
...I think you should see
what you did to Sofia.

1:30:17.870 --> 1:30:21.706
The press won't get hold of this
if you get away quickly.

1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:26.837
This is Julie Gianni,
this is not Sofia.

1:30:28.214 --> 1:30:30.132
This is Julie Gianni.

1:30:31.217 --> 1:30:34.302
I didn't do this to her.
Someone's setting me up.

1:30:34.470 --> 1:30:38.265
David, the board and I
have taken care of everything.

1:30:38.433 --> 1:30:42.227
They've been really great, actually.

1:30:42.478 --> 1:30:49.234
All this is going to disappear.
We're all behind you, even the board.

1:31:01.372 --> 1:31:03.123
Get out of here.

1:31:06.836 --> 1:31:09.171
This is a revolution of the mind.

1:31:18.347 --> 1:31:20.474
You're insane!

1:31:21.309 --> 1:31:23.351
Don't ever hit a girl!

1:31:23.519 --> 1:31:26.396
Hit me, but don't ever hit a girl!

1:31:26.564 --> 1:31:29.399
It wasn't Sofia.
It was Julie.

1:31:30.526 --> 1:31:34.070
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.

1:31:36.115 --> 1:31:39.034
So Sofia was abducted by Julie

1:31:39.660 --> 1:31:42.454
and now Julie is posing as Sofia.

1:31:45.374 --> 1:31:48.084
You're in OJ land, man.

1:31:48.628 --> 1:31:50.629
Julie Gianni is dead!

1:31:50.796 --> 1:31:56.426
I don't care what they told you.
I can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.

1:31:56.594 --> 1:32:02.015
- I didn't talk to them, I talked to Sofia.
- Where is she?

1:32:02.183 --> 1:32:05.435
I just dropped Sofia off.
I saw everything you did to her.

1:32:05.603 --> 1:32:07.979
I did not do that to her.

1:32:09.899 --> 1:32:15.195
Look me in the eye and tell me
that's the girl you brought to the party.

1:32:15.363 --> 1:32:20.283
Tell me that's your dream girl,
your proximity infatuation.

1:32:20.493 --> 1:32:24.120
Yes! And you stole her from me.

1:32:24.330 --> 1:32:28.291
The one girl I really wanted
and you took her from me.

1:32:28.459 --> 1:32:31.378
You're insane.
You're losing it, man!

1:32:31.629 --> 1:32:34.965
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

1:32:35.508 --> 1:32:38.218
I'm with them.

1:32:42.932 --> 1:32:47.769
Where did you get the coat, Brian?
Where did you get the camera?

1:32:48.437 --> 1:32:50.480
How much did they pay you?

1:32:51.566 --> 1:32:55.986
Listen to me, because this is the last time
we're ever going to speak.

1:32:56.112 --> 1:33:00.490
- I was your only friend.
- You have revealed yourself to me.

1:33:24.015 --> 1:33:25.599
Problems?

1:33:26.726 --> 1:33:29.561
I'm in no mood
to be fucked with, so...

1:33:29.770 --> 1:33:32.856
There's an explanation for all this, David.

1:33:34.650 --> 1:33:38.111
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.

1:33:39.864 --> 1:33:42.574
I'm here to help you, David.

1:33:44.535 --> 1:33:48.330
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?

1:33:48.497 --> 1:33:51.916
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

1:33:53.544 --> 1:33:57.172
Calm down? Calm down!

1:33:57.340 --> 1:34:00.592
You must overcome your fears
and regain control.

1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:04.846
Take hold of your life again, David.
It's as easy as holding that glass.

1:34:06.140 --> 1:34:10.935
What if I were to tell you that you can
take control of all of this?

1:34:11.479 --> 1:34:13.521
Even me.

1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:16.441
I'm straight, OK?

1:34:20.905 --> 1:34:23.865
David, look at all these people.

1:34:23.991 --> 1:34:27.410
Seems as though they're all just
chatting away, doesn't it?

1:34:27.578 --> 1:34:29.829
- Nothing to do with you?
- No.

1:34:29.997 --> 1:34:34.918
And yet maybe they're only here
because you wanted them to be here.

1:34:36.337 --> 1:34:38.380
You are their god.

1:34:38.547 --> 1:34:42.926
You can make them obey you
or even destroy you.

1:34:43.094 --> 1:34:47.305
What I'd love for them to do
is shut the fuck up,

1:34:47.473 --> 1:34:48.932
especially you.

1:35:01.362 --> 1:35:02.946
You see?

1:35:15.084 --> 1:35:17.502
You and I signed a contract, David.

1:35:17.670 --> 1:35:20.672
Who is the man in the restaurant?
Who is it?

1:35:23.259 --> 1:35:26.469
Can you tell the difference
between dreams and reality?

1:35:26.637 --> 1:35:29.180
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.

1:35:30.433 --> 1:35:35.770
Think with your head.
You signed a contract, did you not?

1:35:37.773 --> 1:35:41.151
- I signed something.
- Was the man in the restaurant there?

1:35:43.195 --> 1:35:46.573
- Fuck!
- Accept your body's resistance.

1:35:46.741 --> 1:35:48.950
Let your head answer.

1:35:51.871 --> 1:35:54.914
- Yes.
- That's right. Who is Ellie?

1:35:57.501 --> 1:36:00.837
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?

1:36:00.963 --> 1:36:04.424
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.

1:36:04.592 --> 1:36:07.677
You understand you hold the keys
to this prison?

1:36:07.845 --> 1:36:10.096
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?

1:36:10.264 --> 1:36:12.390
- No.
- Who was it?

1:36:18.981 --> 1:36:22.192
You want to let it out,
don't you, David?

1:36:24.612 --> 1:36:27.405
You're about to tell me.

1:36:27.907 --> 1:36:33.411
Tell me what your heart and soul
will not allow you to forget.

1:36:36.415 --> 1:36:38.666
Did you kill Sofia?

1:37:29.927 --> 1:37:31.970
I thought you were a vandal.

1:37:34.139 --> 1:37:36.516
Who are you?

1:37:40.646 --> 1:37:42.605
I'm Sofia.

1:37:44.483 --> 1:37:47.443
You are not Sofia!

1:37:50.030 --> 1:37:53.116
You are not Sofia.

1:37:54.618 --> 1:37:58.705
I'm Sofia.
We're going to be together again.

1:37:59.915 --> 1:38:03.918
You're going to forget about Juliana
and we're going to be together.

1:38:04.044 --> 1:38:06.921
I'm not going to be afraid of you
any more.

1:38:07.089 --> 1:38:10.049
I'll get you a cold towel.
I'll be right back.

1:38:11.176 --> 1:38:13.136
I love you.

1:38:32.031 --> 1:38:34.449
Pleasure delayer.

1:38:42.958 --> 1:38:44.959
Sofia?

1:39:03.354 --> 1:39:05.438
I am Sofia.

1:39:11.654 --> 1:39:16.115
I love you.
I missed you so much.

1:39:25.542 --> 1:39:27.585
Where were you?

1:39:33.217 --> 1:39:38.972
Forget it. I don't need to know.
It doesn't matter.

1:39:41.976 --> 1:39:44.143
Just tell me that you love me.

1:39:49.650 --> 1:39:51.442
I love you.

1:39:53.988 --> 1:39:56.948
What is happiness to you, David?

1:39:57.116 --> 1:40:00.410
For me, it's being here with you.

1:40:07.543 --> 1:40:10.586
What the fuck is happening?

1:40:13.841 --> 1:40:16.175
What the fuck is happening?

1:40:16.343 --> 1:40:19.846
David was a real delight as a child.

1:40:23.809 --> 1:40:27.020
I'm so afraid of how powerful this is.

1:40:28.272 --> 1:40:30.565
Oh, David.

1:40:49.251 --> 1:40:51.210
Red dress, strappy shoes...

1:41:01.263 --> 1:41:04.599
That is the greatest thing
I have ever heard.

1:41:05.517 --> 1:41:08.644
I'll tell you in another life
when we are both cats.

1:41:15.194 --> 1:41:17.403
What's happening?

1:42:40.529 --> 1:42:42.864
I did it, didn't I?

1:42:45.033 --> 1:42:48.619
But I don't feel like I killed someone.

1:42:51.123 --> 1:42:56.961
- I feel like I'm in a dream.
- Who was the man at the restaurant?

1:43:15.939 --> 1:43:20.193
Sometimes the mind behaves
as if it were a dream.

1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:24.238
Faces change,
people become other people.

1:43:25.282 --> 1:43:28.910
The subconscious is a powerful thing.

1:43:30.078 --> 1:43:33.873
You treated Julie carelessly,
didn't you?

1:43:42.633 --> 1:43:46.260
Your feelings of responsibility
or guilt over Julie

1:43:46.428 --> 1:43:50.056
might have turned Sofia into Julie.

1:43:52.601 --> 1:43:56.520
- Do you know what derangement is?
- I need your help.

1:43:58.815 --> 1:44:03.694
All I know is you killed your girlfriend
and I don't know what's in your mind.

1:44:03.862 --> 1:44:05.988
I need your help.

1:44:06.156 --> 1:44:10.993
I would work on this case forever
if I could, but we've run out of time.

1:44:15.666 --> 1:44:17.959
What will you plead?

1:44:21.255 --> 1:44:26.092
Temporary derangement.
That's your best chance.

1:44:28.053 --> 1:44:30.429
I don't think they'll believe me.

1:44:31.682 --> 1:44:34.267
Who do you believe?

1:44:35.394 --> 1:44:38.562
Believe it or not, I care about you.

1:44:39.815 --> 1:44:44.402
You've become like family
to me.

1:44:48.323 --> 1:44:51.284
I don't want to give up on you, David.

1:44:51.493 --> 1:44:56.080
But I needed more.
I needed an answer.

1:44:57.040 --> 1:44:59.875
I even thought there was a chance

1:45:00.002 --> 1:45:02.420
somebody was playing
a trick on you.

1:45:02.587 --> 1:45:07.591
Maybe it was the board.
But I can't exceed my duties.

1:45:12.514 --> 1:45:15.558
I'm just a psychologist...

1:45:16.810 --> 1:45:19.061
...and I have to go now.

1:45:22.941 --> 1:45:25.735
Will I see you at the trial?

1:45:26.737 --> 1:45:30.990
No, I'm just the opening act.

1:45:51.011 --> 1:45:55.306
Reassurance is our speciality.
That's the Life Extension creed.

1:46:03.273 --> 1:46:06.025
Benny the dog was frozen
for three months

1:46:06.193 --> 1:46:08.652
and thawed out to live a normal life.

1:46:08.820 --> 1:46:12.698
Life Extension can translate
to the human form, too.

1:46:13.367 --> 1:46:16.160
How do you accomplish such a thing?

1:46:16.370 --> 1:46:22.333
72 cryonised patients are currently held
at our facility in New Brunswick.

1:46:22.501 --> 1:46:27.421
We feature the finest scientific
technicians on the planet.

1:46:28.965 --> 1:46:32.259
- The book is "Life, The Sequel".
- McCabe!

1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:35.513
McCabe!

1:46:37.140 --> 1:46:39.183
Come back!

1:47:16.221 --> 1:47:21.267
Life Extension Corporation, please.
LE. We hold a court order.

1:47:24.354 --> 1:47:26.772
I think I've been here before.

1:47:39.411 --> 1:47:42.496
- Her name is Libby.
- Good morning, Mr McCabe.

1:47:42.664 --> 1:47:45.958
I'm Libby. I'm here to assist you.

1:47:47.794 --> 1:47:50.379
He's my son. He's very shy.

1:47:50.547 --> 1:47:54.717
You're not with the media
or part of any legal consortium?

1:47:56.678 --> 1:47:58.721
Welcome to Life Extension.

1:47:58.930 --> 1:48:02.057
Take a look at our proposal.
Please follow me.

1:48:02.225 --> 1:48:04.768
You can wait out here.

1:48:04.936 --> 1:48:09.231
You'll be meeting Rebecca Dearborn,
my personal role model.

1:48:11.359 --> 1:48:14.236
I didn't need the pain any more.

1:48:15.489 --> 1:48:17.781
Life Extension wants you to live.

1:48:20.577 --> 1:48:24.038
I don't think that God
disapproves of this.

1:48:24.206 --> 1:48:26.832
Cryonisation,
is a journey of reawakening

1:48:26.958 --> 1:48:30.920
after the preservation of the human body
at extremely low temperatures.

1:48:31.087 --> 1:48:34.173
- They laughed at Jules Verne, too.
- David, you are not...

1:48:34.341 --> 1:48:37.176
Mr McCabe, how are you?
I'm Rebecca Dearborn.

1:48:40.388 --> 1:48:44.475
Life Extension,
or LE as we like to refer to it,

1:48:44.643 --> 1:48:50.064
is a glimpse of the future.
A ticket, not in the juvenile sense

1:48:50.232 --> 1:48:55.277
but in the deeply meaningful sense
that can only be borne in the human heart.

1:48:57.739 --> 1:49:00.783
The DNA codes of the human body
have been broken.

1:49:00.951 --> 1:49:05.663
Soon heart ailments, cancer,
so much more will be a thing of the past.

1:49:05.830 --> 1:49:10.459
Very simply, your anguish,
your discontent, even your death

1:49:10.627 --> 1:49:13.754
is no longer necessary
in a traditional sense.

1:49:13.922 --> 1:49:18.133
Whatever malady hides
behind that mask, it's temporary.

1:49:19.636 --> 1:49:24.557
Within an hour of your passing,
LE will transfer your body to a vessel

1:49:24.724 --> 1:49:29.395
where you will be sealed and frozen
at 196 degrees below zero.

1:49:29.563 --> 1:49:33.899
Power outages, earthquakes, nothing
will affect your suspension hibernation.

1:49:34.025 --> 1:49:36.986
Have you signed a contract
with these people, David?

1:49:40.699 --> 1:49:44.577
- What's the Lucid Dream option?
- Good choice.

1:49:45.328 --> 1:49:48.914
The Lucid Dream
is Life Extension's newest option.

1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:50.666
For a little extra,

1:49:50.834 --> 1:49:56.880
we offer the cryonic union
of science and entertainment.

1:49:58.091 --> 1:49:59.758
Cryotainment.

1:50:03.888 --> 1:50:06.890
Some find this presentation helpful.

1:50:19.362 --> 1:50:22.197
Portrait of a modern
human life.

1:50:22.365 --> 1:50:27.036
American, male, birth and death.

1:50:27.704 --> 1:50:31.165
Imagine that you are suffering
from a terminal illness.

1:50:31.374 --> 1:50:34.877
You'd like to be cryonised
but you'd rather be resurrected

1:50:35.003 --> 1:50:37.796
to continue your own life
as you know it now.

1:50:37.964 --> 1:50:40.591
LE offers you the answer.

1:50:40.759 --> 1:50:46.472
Upon resurrection, you will continue
in an ageless state, preserved,

1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:50.768
but living in the present
with a future of your choosing.

1:50:51.645 --> 1:50:54.355
Your death will be wiped
from your memory.

1:50:54.522 --> 1:50:56.231
Your life will continue

1:50:56.399 --> 1:50:58.025
as a realistic work of art,

1:50:58.193 --> 1:51:00.027
painted by you minute to minute.

1:51:00.236 --> 1:51:02.279
You'll live it with the romantic abandon

1:51:02.489 --> 1:51:03.781
of a summer day,

1:51:03.948 --> 1:51:06.575
with the feeling of a great movie

1:51:06.743 --> 1:51:09.036
or pop song you always loved.

1:51:09.204 --> 1:51:12.956
With no memory of how it occurred,
save for the knowledge

1:51:13.083 --> 1:51:16.585
that everything simply improved.

1:51:17.420 --> 1:51:21.965
In any instance of discontent,
you'll be visited by technical support.

1:51:22.133 --> 1:51:23.842
It's just around the corner.

1:51:24.010 --> 1:51:29.348
The day after tomorrow,
another chapter begins seamlessly.

1:51:29.516 --> 1:51:34.019
A living dream,
Life Extension's promise to you.

1:51:34.312 --> 1:51:35.979
Life part two.

1:51:36.564 --> 1:51:38.732
A living dream.

1:51:40.902 --> 1:51:44.196
Your death will be wiped
from your memory.

1:51:44.364 --> 1:51:46.865
I guess I missed that one
in "USA Today".

1:51:46.991 --> 1:51:51.995
A dream.
What if there was a mistake?

1:51:53.456 --> 1:51:56.375
What if the dream became a nightmare?

1:51:57.711 --> 1:52:02.214
Your subconscious
can always play tricks on you.

1:52:03.049 --> 1:52:06.635
The subconscious
is a very powerful thing.

1:52:10.014 --> 1:52:12.599
Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

1:52:12.809 --> 1:52:16.061
But this is a serious business.

1:52:17.063 --> 1:52:20.190
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk.

1:52:21.401 --> 1:52:25.195
And what is any life
if not the pursuit of a dream?

1:52:25.363 --> 1:52:29.616
The dream of peace,
the dream of achievement,

1:52:30.952 --> 1:52:33.996
the dream of hearing someone
say these words...

1:52:34.164 --> 1:52:36.457
...when they truly mean them:

1:52:39.544 --> 1:52:41.503
I love you, David.

1:52:44.090 --> 1:52:46.049
I love you.

1:52:50.221 --> 1:52:54.475
Roam free, David.
Most of us live our whole lives

1:52:54.642 --> 1:52:59.104
without any real adventure
to call our own.

1:52:59.272 --> 1:53:03.817
It's hard to comprehend,
but they laughed at Jules Verne, too.

1:53:06.529 --> 1:53:10.032
This is a revolution of the mind.

1:53:32.138 --> 1:53:35.974
I want to wake up!
Tech support!

1:53:40.063 --> 1:53:42.523
It's a nightmare!

1:53:59.415 --> 1:54:02.209
Tech support!

1:54:17.433 --> 1:54:20.477
Tech support!

1:54:57.473 --> 1:55:02.227
David Aames. I think it's time
we had a proper introduction.

1:55:02.395 --> 1:55:05.439
I'm Edmund Ventura
from the Oasis project,

1:55:05.648 --> 1:55:07.983
formerly Life Extension, LE.

1:55:08.109 --> 1:55:11.987
- Tech support?
- Yes, I'm your tech support.

1:55:12.196 --> 1:55:15.282
We first met 150 years ago.

1:55:16.284 --> 1:55:20.203
Shit. You sold me the Lucid Dream.

1:55:22.457 --> 1:55:26.501
- What the hell happened?
- I tried to warn you in the bar, David.

1:55:26.669 --> 1:55:30.756
I told you that it all depended
on your mind.

1:55:31.507 --> 1:55:35.218
All of this, everything is your creation.

1:55:35.386 --> 1:55:38.221
Now we're heading towards
your true moment of choice.

1:55:39.349 --> 1:55:42.142
- True moment of choice?
- Yes.

1:55:47.357 --> 1:55:49.316
When did the Lucid Dream begin?

1:55:49.484 --> 1:55:52.819
- Do you remember the night club?
- We'll meet up soon.

1:55:54.739 --> 1:55:58.325
That night, after Sofia left you
and you fell asleep on the pavement,

1:55:58.534 --> 1:56:01.578
that was the moment
that you chose for the splice.

1:56:01.746 --> 1:56:04.331
- Splice?
- Splice.

1:56:04.499 --> 1:56:08.585
The end of your real life
and the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.

1:56:08.753 --> 1:56:10.587
A splice of many years

1:56:10.755 --> 1:56:13.715
which passed while you were frozen
and dreaming.

1:56:13.883 --> 1:56:15.968
From the moment you woke up,

1:56:16.094 --> 1:56:19.763
- nothing was real in the traditional sense.
- Open your eyes.

1:56:19.973 --> 1:56:22.599
Your Lucid Dream is monitored
by Life Extension

1:56:22.809 --> 1:56:26.061
and a panel of experts
following your every thought,

1:56:26.229 --> 1:56:28.939
even at this moment.

1:56:30.108 --> 1:56:32.317
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.

1:56:36.739 --> 1:56:39.658
I'm not a big fan of heights.

1:56:39.993 --> 1:56:41.743
I know.

1:56:41.911 --> 1:56:44.913
We erased what really happened
from your memory.

1:56:45.039 --> 1:56:47.165
- Erased?
- Replaced...

1:56:47.333 --> 1:56:53.255
...by a better life, under these
beautiful, Monet-like skies.

1:56:54.841 --> 1:56:59.970
- My mother's favourite.
- A better life because you had Sofia.

1:57:00.596 --> 1:57:05.058
You sculpted your Lucid Dream
out of the iconography of your youth.

1:57:05.226 --> 1:57:09.312
- An album cover that once moved you.
- An album cover?

1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:13.942
There are some things that you're not
old enough to understand just yet.

1:57:14.068 --> 1:57:18.030
A movie you saw once that showed you
what a father could be like.

1:57:28.708 --> 1:57:30.876
Or what love could be like.

1:57:31.335 --> 1:57:37.090
This was a kind woman, an individual.
More than your equal.

1:57:38.134 --> 1:57:39.760
You barely knew her in your real life,

1:57:39.969 --> 1:57:44.264
but in your Lucid Dream
she was your saviour.

1:57:48.770 --> 1:57:51.980
What happened in my real life?
Something happened.

1:57:52.106 --> 1:57:54.900
- What did you erase?
- Do you really want to know?

1:57:57.612 --> 1:57:59.988
Tell me everything.

1:58:00.114 --> 1:58:04.868
The morning after the night club, you woke
up on the street, hungover and alone.

1:58:04.994 --> 1:58:10.248
You got up and you walked away.
You never saw Sofia again.

1:58:16.672 --> 1:58:18.423
I didn't kill Sofia.

1:58:19.759 --> 1:58:21.635
No.

1:58:21.803 --> 1:58:26.932
You battled your board, the Seven Dwarfs,
for control of the company.

1:58:27.058 --> 1:58:29.851
In the end it was Thomas Tipp,
your father's friend,

1:58:29.977 --> 1:58:34.064
who wrenched the company
back into your control.

1:58:35.858 --> 1:58:37.901
Tommy.

1:58:38.986 --> 1:58:40.904
But then...

1:58:41.489 --> 1:58:43.990
...somebody died.

1:58:46.452 --> 1:58:48.995
You longed for Sofia.

1:58:49.122 --> 1:58:52.833
You shut yourself away for months.
You were alone.

1:58:52.959 --> 1:58:56.211
You couldn't stand the pain any more,
the headaches.

1:58:56.379 --> 1:59:01.174
- You could barely function.
- I found you on the Internet.

1:59:04.595 --> 1:59:07.597
I signed a contract with you and then...

1:59:29.203 --> 1:59:31.371
I remember.

1:59:40.173 --> 1:59:42.340
Somebody died.

1:59:43.968 --> 1:59:45.260
It was me.

1:59:52.810 --> 1:59:55.604
And on a day in late December...

1:59:56.314 --> 1:59:59.232
...you gave yourself to us.

2:00:00.318 --> 2:00:03.778
You're now in a suspended state.

2:00:07.200 --> 2:00:11.745
Your friend Brian Shelby threw
a three-day memorial in your old home.

2:00:11.913 --> 2:00:14.414
He was a true friend.

2:00:23.299 --> 2:00:25.800
You were missed, David.

2:00:47.823 --> 2:00:51.076
It was Sofia who never fully recovered.

2:00:52.495 --> 2:00:55.705
It was she who somehow
knew you best.

2:00:56.457 --> 2:00:59.292
Like you, she never forgot that one night

2:00:59.460 --> 2:01:03.088
where true love seemed possible.

2:01:11.138 --> 2:01:13.515
Consequences, David.

2:01:30.074 --> 2:01:32.450
It's the little things.

2:01:36.372 --> 2:01:38.832
The little things.

2:01:39.792 --> 2:01:42.961
There's nothing bigger, is there?

2:01:51.178 --> 2:01:54.973
Your subconscious did create problems.

2:01:55.933 --> 2:01:58.977
Your dream turned into a nightmare.

2:01:59.270 --> 2:02:02.355
The glitch has been corrected.

2:02:03.399 --> 2:02:06.151
So all I have to do is imagine something?

2:02:06.319 --> 2:02:10.363
Like if I wanted McCabe
to come back right now.

2:02:13.993 --> 2:02:17.537
Listen to me.
These people are dangerous.

2:02:18.831 --> 2:02:22.500
We're in trouble.
We need to get off this roof now.

2:02:25.963 --> 2:02:30.175
We're now on pause, and you're about
to return to your Lucid Dream.

2:02:30.343 --> 2:02:32.093
Pause?

2:02:32.261 --> 2:02:37.223
You won't remember any of this, nor will
you be charged for technical support.

2:02:37.391 --> 2:02:40.477
It's now your moment of choice.

2:02:40.936 --> 2:02:45.648
You can return to your Lucid Dream
and live a beautiful life with Sofia

2:02:45.816 --> 2:02:48.276
or whomever you wish.

2:02:48.444 --> 2:02:51.613
Or you can choose the world out there.

2:02:55.201 --> 2:02:56.493
The world out there?

2:02:57.370 --> 2:03:01.456
And you can bring me back?
Just like Benny the dog?

2:03:01.665 --> 2:03:05.085
Yes, just like Benny the dog.

2:03:06.962 --> 2:03:09.381
Your face and body can be fixed now,

2:03:10.591 --> 2:03:16.179
but things are very different now.
And your finances won't last long.

2:03:17.765 --> 2:03:21.935
Your panel of observers
are waiting for you to choose.

2:03:25.981 --> 2:03:31.277
There are no guarantees.
But remember, even in the future,

2:03:31.445 --> 2:03:35.990
the sweet is never as sweet
without the sour.

2:03:54.885 --> 2:03:58.721
- How do I wake up?
- The decision is yours.

2:04:03.894 --> 2:04:07.188
I chose this scenario, didn't I?

2:04:07.815 --> 2:04:12.735
Yes, to face your last remaining
fear of heights.

2:04:12.903 --> 2:04:14.779
David, don't listen to him.

2:04:14.947 --> 2:04:17.782
This is the Seven Dwarfs. it's a set-up!

2:04:17.950 --> 2:04:20.618
You can't trust him.

2:04:20.786 --> 2:04:24.539
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.

2:04:24.707 --> 2:04:27.500
It's in his nature
to fight for his existence,

2:04:27.668 --> 2:04:30.420
- but he's not real.
- I'm real.

2:04:33.257 --> 2:04:36.968
I'm real.
I have two daughters.

2:04:37.094 --> 2:04:38.970
You know that.

2:04:39.722 --> 2:04:41.222
What are their names?

2:04:56.280 --> 2:04:57.947
I'm real.

2:04:59.074 --> 2:05:01.159
I'm...

2:05:03.871 --> 2:05:08.666
Mortality as home entertainment?
This cannot be the future!

2:05:10.461 --> 2:05:12.420
Can it?

2:05:13.547 --> 2:05:15.590
Can it?

2:05:43.494 --> 2:05:44.953
Goodbye.

2:05:48.165 --> 2:05:54.837
It's been a journey of self-awakening.
Now you've got to ask yourself this.

2:05:54.964 --> 2:05:57.382
What is happiness to you, David?

2:06:04.515 --> 2:06:07.308
I want to live a real life.

2:06:07.977 --> 2:06:10.270
I don't want to dream any longer.

2:06:11.397 --> 2:06:13.398
Any last wishes?

2:06:16.235 --> 2:06:19.696
Let them out there read my mind.

2:06:20.739 --> 2:06:23.199
I wish you well, David.

2:07:02.740 --> 2:07:07.201
Look at us.
I'm frozen and you're dead.

2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:10.163
And I love you.

2:07:11.665 --> 2:07:13.958
It's a problem.

2:07:17.087 --> 2:07:21.507
I lost you when I got in that car.
I'm sorry.

2:07:24.386 --> 2:07:27.055
Do you remember
what you told me once?

2:07:28.098 --> 2:07:30.642
Every passing minute

2:07:31.477 --> 2:07:34.937
is another chance to turn it all around.

2:07:39.985 --> 2:07:42.362
I'll find you again.

2:07:58.462 --> 2:08:01.089
I'll see you in another life...

2:08:01.256 --> 2:08:03.216
...when we are both cats.

2:09:15.748 --> 2:09:18.708
Relax, David. Open your eyes.
