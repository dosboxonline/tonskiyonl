WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.703
[Ragnar] Last season
on Vikings...

00:02.736 --> 00:04.638
Our country's in grave danger.

00:04.672 --> 00:05.906
[Erik] The Rus are coming.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.076
Harald is King of all Norway.
You have to reach out to him.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.445
You have no idea
what you are facing.
The end of everything.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.115
People always say
it's the end
of everything.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.616
But they don't usually mean it.

00:17.185 --> 00:20.354
Othere, meet Ubbe,
the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.657
I was sailing west.
The sun rose behind me.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.493
And I saw a golden land.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.627
To the Golden Land.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.529
I am with child,

00:28.562 --> 00:30.531
and I am married
to a demigod,
as are you.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.866
-I will make you
Queen of all Norway.
-[Ingrid] We have just met

00:32.900 --> 00:34.768
and already you want me
to betray my husband.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.804
-I want you now.
-[groaning]

00:36.837 --> 00:38.839
We cannot control our fate.
We must accept it.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.242
[crying] My baby.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.213
[Bjorn] The Rus will attack
from the sea.

00:45.246 --> 00:49.317
We will bring these smaller
barges, transfer our warriors
into them and storm the beach.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.886
Charge!

00:52.920 --> 00:54.088
Loose.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.824
Stand up and fight!

00:56.857 --> 00:58.792
How are we to repel
such a huge force?

00:58.826 --> 01:00.661
[Bjorn] We will block
the entrance leading
into the fjord

01:00.694 --> 01:02.363
and we will lay a boom across
the mouth of the river.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.064
[all grunting]

01:07.201 --> 01:08.836
[Ivar] That river leads
into the mountains.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.839
It's a formidable obstacle,
but we shall climb it.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.040
[grunting]

01:17.044 --> 01:18.112
[all grunting]

01:19.247 --> 01:20.581
Forward!

01:20.614 --> 01:22.015
I will defeat you.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.417
There is no way you can win.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.087
Save yourself, skogarmaor.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.823
[grunting]

01:29.857 --> 01:32.226
The gods abandoned you
a long time ago, my brother.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.237
[inaudible]

01:45.806 --> 01:48.476
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

02:40.794 --> 02:42.630
[somber instrumental
music playing]

03:20.000 --> 03:21.769
Here's to victory, my friends!

03:21.802 --> 03:24.638
[crowd cheering]

03:24.672 --> 03:27.508
The battle of Norway
is not over yet.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.643
They have only retreated...

03:29.677 --> 03:32.480
and probably back
to their fortress
at Kattegat.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.049
But probably
without their talisman.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.686
Their hero. Their leader.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.055
They say you
killed him yourself.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.724
Mmm.

03:43.757 --> 03:47.227
I cannot be completely sure
that Bjorn was dead.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.762
It's not possible
to kill Bjorn.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.235
I saw him,
getting carried off

03:55.269 --> 03:56.704
the battlefield
with my own eyes.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.241
But you cannot say
that he was still alive?

04:01.275 --> 04:04.111
[Hvitserk] Uh, no.
No, I cannot.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.916
[Ivar] So,

04:08.949 --> 04:10.584
when do we leave for Kattegat?

04:12.753 --> 04:16.023
As soon as we have
repaired our ships.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.326
This business must be finished.

04:18.359 --> 04:21.094
I confess, we lost
more warriors in the battle

04:22.195 --> 04:23.564
than I had expected.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.868
You Vikings fight hard.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.037
[door opens]

04:35.643 --> 04:36.977
[chains clanking]

04:37.611 --> 04:39.780
[groans]

04:39.813 --> 04:41.114
[Oleg] Who are these prisoners?

04:42.550 --> 04:47.421
This is King Olaf,
once the ruler here.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.090
And this is King Harald.
King of all of Norway!

04:51.091 --> 04:52.593
Is all that true?

04:53.894 --> 04:54.995
[breathing heavily]

04:57.565 --> 04:58.566
Yes.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.301
Alas to say.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.072
You cast your net...

05:07.107 --> 05:08.976
And when you hauled it in,

05:09.009 --> 05:11.244
you found that
you have caught both

05:11.278 --> 05:13.881
the King and the Joker.

05:13.914 --> 05:17.084
King Olaf's jokes
were never,
never my taste.

05:17.117 --> 05:21.389
Oh! I thought
we got on famously,

05:21.422 --> 05:25.426
Hvitserk, son of Ragnar.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.463
Well, do you remember me?

05:30.664 --> 05:33.667
I too am Ragnar's son.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.003
Oh, I know who you are...

05:37.170 --> 05:40.173
Ivar, the Boneless.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.274
[chuckles]

05:41.308 --> 05:44.311
From the sewers of York

05:44.344 --> 05:46.847
to the Silk Roads, your...

05:46.880 --> 05:51.118
your name is legendary.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.420
[Oleg] The question is...

05:53.387 --> 05:55.456
what to do with you both?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.159
In what ways

06:00.160 --> 06:01.695
can you possibly...

06:03.230 --> 06:04.632
be useful to me?

06:06.467 --> 06:09.570
I have no intention
of being useful to you.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.943
I won't bargain for my life.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.246
For a Viking,
that would be demeaning.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
To us, death is bliss...

06:25.018 --> 06:26.186
and I rush to bleed.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.492
And what about you?

06:31.525 --> 06:34.928
Oh, I, uh, I'm not in a rush.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.665
[chuckles]

06:44.572 --> 06:46.006
[grim music playing]

07:40.127 --> 07:41.629
The Rus
will be here soon.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.945
[indistinct chatter]

07:57.978 --> 08:00.714
[Ubbe] Spring is here at last.

08:00.748 --> 08:04.184
We should begin
our preparations
to sail west.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.119
Our preparations
for our journey.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.388
[Othere] Oh, yes.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.992
I'm ready to put my house
in order and submit myself
to the elements again.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.828
And what about you, Ketill?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.330
Will you come with us?

08:17.364 --> 08:21.769
I plan to sail with two ships,
and about 40 people.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.204
That means some of the settlers
will have to come with us.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.674
I have made a recent habit

08:26.707 --> 08:28.642
of confession.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.245
I have told everyone

08:32.279 --> 08:33.180
that will listen

08:33.213 --> 08:34.247
that I want to be

08:34.281 --> 08:35.215
King of Iceland.

08:36.584 --> 08:37.918
I know.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.920
I can see...

08:39.953 --> 08:42.756
that this Icelandic
settlement will grow,

08:42.790 --> 08:47.427
become rich, attract all manner
of new settlers.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.296
To be King of such a place...

08:50.898 --> 08:52.833
it would be
an extraordinary achievement

08:52.866 --> 08:54.668
for a simple fellow like me.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.903
So, you won't come?

08:57.370 --> 09:00.140
You won't sacrifice
your ambitions?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.643
No. I won't sacrifice
my ambitions.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.480
But they can wait.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.654
Then it is decided.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.488
Let the settlers choose
amongst themselves

09:15.522 --> 09:16.857
who will come with us.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.662
And may the gods guide us
to the Golden Land.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.436
[somber music playing]

10:13.080 --> 10:14.247
[wheezes]

10:17.718 --> 10:19.086
[mumbling]

10:24.892 --> 10:26.293
[mumbling]

10:36.770 --> 10:38.605
[door opens]

10:46.814 --> 10:48.448
[Oleg] I have
some good news...

10:48.481 --> 10:49.950
and some bad news.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.487
The good news is...

10:54.521 --> 10:56.589
I have decided
to spare your life...

10:58.458 --> 11:01.194
King Harald.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.264
[chuckles]

11:05.598 --> 11:08.168
The bad news is
your life is over...

11:09.369 --> 11:10.470
King Olaf.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.176
You are a King
without a kingdom.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.980
What use is that to anyone?

11:34.627 --> 11:36.696
I might have made
a different decision.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.302
But then you don't have...

11:43.403 --> 11:47.975
the power, do you, Ivar?

12:03.023 --> 12:04.191
[door shuts]

12:04.224 --> 12:05.692
You lucky bastard.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.861
[breathing heavily]

12:08.762 --> 12:10.764
[exhales] I know.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.735
[Ingrid sniffling]

12:17.404 --> 12:18.438
[Bjorn wheezing]

12:20.941 --> 12:21.875
Ingrid.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.346
Come here.

12:28.048 --> 12:28.916
Come.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.401
[Gunnhild] Why are you
being so pathetic?

12:50.237 --> 12:51.571
It's not just Bjorn.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.607
Then what?

12:57.244 --> 12:58.578
King Harald raped me.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.449
[breathes deeply]

13:06.053 --> 13:07.620
[Gunnhild] If I ever
get the chance,

13:08.822 --> 13:10.257
I will cut his throat.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.395
But it is not likely.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.166
You and I will die here,
alongside our husband.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.904
And if you fight well
and bravely enough,

13:23.937 --> 13:25.772
we shall meet again afterwards.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.210
[sighs]

13:30.243 --> 13:33.914
I told Bjorn I would bring him
luck and good fortune.

13:35.648 --> 13:39.920
Instead, I have brought him
pain and ruin.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.292
You are not a god, Ingrid.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.162
Just another human being.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.100
All you could ever give Bjorn

13:53.133 --> 13:55.168
was what you could hold
in the palm of your hand.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.374
You give me such courage.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.211
Thank you.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.180
Come.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.654
Go to sleep.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.524
Don't be afraid.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.733
[wheezing continues]

14:47.320 --> 14:49.156
There is someone beside me.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.660
[Oleg] There is no one
beside you.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.162
You are all alone.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.830
No. There is someone beside me.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.134
Although I cannot see him,

15:02.535 --> 15:04.804
I know he is here.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.975
How do you know, you old fool?

15:08.008 --> 15:11.111
Because he speaks to me.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.081
I hear his voice.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.482
And what does he say?

15:15.515 --> 15:19.752
He says, "He who
believes in Me,

15:19.786 --> 15:23.656
"though he may die,
he shall live.

15:23.690 --> 15:27.594
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.929
"I shall walk beside you.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.767
"Always. Always."

15:36.436 --> 15:38.471
Don't listen to him.
Get on with it.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.320
Don't be afraid.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.190
I can't.

15:57.224 --> 16:00.160
Think of me as already dead.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.430
Nothing more can hurt me.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.300
Not the thunder,

16:07.334 --> 16:09.836
nor the deep swell
of the waves,

16:10.903 --> 16:14.741
nor yet, the tongues of fire.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.643
[inhales sharply]

16:28.188 --> 16:29.556
I'm sorry.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.091
[King Olaf] Don't be.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.126
My lands are in order.

16:34.094 --> 16:38.531
And I am ripe for heaven.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.103
[grunting]

17:56.109 --> 17:58.245
[breathing deeply]

18:02.482 --> 18:03.650
How?

18:08.388 --> 18:11.824
How did King Harald
escape? Hmm?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.360
[dramatic music playing]

18:36.983 --> 18:38.451
[indistinct chatter]

18:40.787 --> 18:42.922
[Ketill] These are the settlers
and their families

18:42.955 --> 18:45.925
who have agreed
to journey with us.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.995
That's good.
That is good.
Thank you.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.232
Thank all of you!

18:52.265 --> 18:55.902
I am certain that you
will not regret this decision.

18:55.935 --> 19:00.106
I am pleased to say my wife,
Ingvild, will come with us.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.008
And my beloved son, Frodi.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.944
Ingvild, Frodi.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.514
I am so happy you have made
a decision to come with us.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.749
You are true Vikings.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.820
You are all true Vikings.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.388
[crowd] Yes!

19:15.422 --> 19:17.089
Come! Eat, drink, celebrate!

19:20.460 --> 19:22.595
We should make
some sacrifice to the gods,

19:22.629 --> 19:24.431
so they may prosper our voyage.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.832
[crowd] Yes!

19:28.000 --> 19:29.369
What do you say, Othere?

19:31.137 --> 19:33.806
You must do
what your gods expect.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.844
My God expects nothing more
than my prayers and my belief
in His presence.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.613
But your God is invisible.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.649
Our gods,
they are all around us.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.317
-They are here right now.
-[goat bleats]

19:45.618 --> 19:47.153
I do not think he is a god.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.689
[laughs]

19:49.722 --> 19:53.793
God is everywhere
and in everything.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.830
Without Him, nothing is.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.033
I believe in the Allfather.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.169
The father of all gods.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.138
And I believe that your god,
he recognizes the Allfather.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.510
I remember all
the ceremonies in Wessex.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.945
And in all those ceremonies

20:12.979 --> 20:17.550
your Christ reaches out
and prays to the Holy Father...

20:18.385 --> 20:19.686
Allfather.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.724
I know that your divine
Father and mine,

20:24.757 --> 20:26.158
they're one and the same.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.419
[door creaking]

20:52.452 --> 20:53.753
[footsteps approaching]

20:58.358 --> 21:00.192
[Gunnhild] King Hakon!

21:00.226 --> 21:03.162
How glad and thankful
we are to see you
at such a time.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.197
Messengers reached me.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.600
I was summoned in the name
of Bjorn Ironside.

21:07.634 --> 21:11.738
And when you are summoned
by a son of Ragnar Lothbrok,
then you come.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.741
I heard news of the Rus attack

21:14.774 --> 21:17.444
and the defeat
of King Harald Finehair.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.447
I hope I am not too late to
help Bjorn defend Kattegat.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.916
We cannot defend Kattegat.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.420
Not unless more
of Norway's rulers
answer his summons!

21:28.821 --> 21:30.022
But even so...

21:30.056 --> 21:32.959
Even so... What is it?

21:37.096 --> 21:38.398
[wheezing]

21:41.000 --> 21:45.037
[softly] You must forgive me
for not rising to welcome you,
King Hakon.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.407
I... I didn't know...

21:48.775 --> 21:49.942
I was wounded.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.147
The most important thing
is that, when the Rus attack...

21:55.982 --> 21:57.817
[breathing heavily]

21:57.850 --> 22:00.152
we have ways to repel them.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.121
How large is their army?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.923
[Bjorn] Their army is vast.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.325
[breathing deeply]

22:07.259 --> 22:08.661
And Ivar is with them.

22:10.930 --> 22:11.998
Of course, he is.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.167
We will make plans.

22:17.504 --> 22:22.274
It will not be so simple
and easy to defeat us.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.613
We need you.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.315
We need you to live.
To lead us.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.351
Your name alone is worth
100 warriors.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.353
No, 1,000 warriors.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.359
Please, for the love of Odin,

22:43.129 --> 22:44.597
don't leave us.

22:44.631 --> 22:45.832
[dramatic music playing]

22:50.970 --> 22:53.806
[drums beating rhythmically]

22:56.976 --> 22:58.745
-[Rus captain] Stay in line!
-[horse neighing]

23:13.926 --> 23:16.062
Oleg will make me
a King of Norway,

23:16.095 --> 23:18.097
perhaps King
of all Scandinavia.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.268
But it will only be in name.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.237
I won't really be King.

23:25.271 --> 23:28.007
Oleg will have
all of the power.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.644
Just as he has always had
all of the power over you,

23:31.678 --> 23:35.314
even though you are the heir
to the whole Rus Empire.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.916
That is how it is.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.851
But how can we change it?

23:38.885 --> 23:43.022
Things are as they are.
The world is as it is.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.391
No.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.663
Nothing is ever permanent.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.165
Everything is always changing.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.734
Shifting.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.504
What is real today
might not be real tomorrow.

23:57.537 --> 24:02.374
But sometimes,
we have to help it to shift.

24:02.408 --> 24:07.379
But how?
Oleg is so powerful.

24:07.413 --> 24:11.017
[Oleg] We must assess
the battlefield,
it's most important.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.721
We will make common cause
with our friend Dir.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.355
[Rus captain at a distance]
Yes, I will see to it at once.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.525
We will have the forces
sufficient enough

24:18.558 --> 24:20.092
to overthrow Prince Oleg.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.228
[Oleg] I want my soldiers
to have every advantage.

24:22.261 --> 24:26.465
But only if the conditions
are right.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.868
Only if we have people
that we can trust

24:28.901 --> 24:30.770
close to the throne.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.472
-[Igor] But who can we trust?
-[Rus captain] Eyes forward!

24:35.975 --> 24:38.044
Oleg is watching us.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.145
[Rus captain] Stay in line!

24:43.282 --> 24:44.250
Keep forward!

24:47.086 --> 24:48.287
[Bjorn gasps]

24:49.689 --> 24:51.357
[grunts and wheezes]

24:59.098 --> 25:00.266
[breathing heavily]

25:01.834 --> 25:03.670
I think you may be with child.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.174
I have lost two children,

25:10.176 --> 25:11.944
and a third I hardly know.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.351
I fear I will not live
to see our child.

25:20.486 --> 25:24.323
Just as I will never be able

25:24.356 --> 25:27.560
to make amends
for all my mistakes now.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.797
All the wrongs I have done.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.202
All the hurt I have caused.

25:39.806 --> 25:43.275
I wish
with all my heart... [gasps]

25:43.309 --> 25:45.578
I could go back,
and start again.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.751
[Ingrid] You have loved
and been loved.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.388
Accept the judgement
of the gods.

26:02.895 --> 26:03.930
[sobs]

26:06.198 --> 26:08.100
My heart is breaking.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.411
What are you hiding?

26:19.445 --> 26:21.380
[scoffs] Hiding?

26:22.782 --> 26:25.017
Yes.

26:25.051 --> 26:28.921
Ketill said that Floki left
before you went on your voyage

26:28.955 --> 26:30.690
but that is not true.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.224
Floki gave you his ring.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.098
Perhaps you should ask Ketill
what happened.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.466
I am not asking Ketill.

26:42.468 --> 26:44.436
I think that you will tell me
the truth...

26:45.271 --> 26:47.674
if your God is watching.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.041
[woman 1] Indeed. Oh!

26:50.777 --> 26:52.578
Come. Let's come back later,
shall we?

26:57.116 --> 27:00.386
The other family,
Eyvind's family.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.021
Is it something
to do with them?

27:05.758 --> 27:08.728
How can we travel together
if we do not trust each other?

27:12.999 --> 27:15.735
[sighs] Ketill and his son...

27:16.969 --> 27:18.570
[Eyvind] Please!

27:18.604 --> 27:21.040
[Othere] ...killed Eyvind
and his whole family

27:21.073 --> 27:22.742
in cold blood.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.977
[Eyvind] Don't kill anyone!

27:25.011 --> 27:28.347
[Othere] And Ketill
had a beautiful,
wise daughter called Aud

27:29.581 --> 27:31.483
who killed herself...

27:31.517 --> 27:33.452
-No!
-...because she could not live

27:33.485 --> 27:35.421
knowing what her father
had done.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.927
She loved him
for being a good man.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.662
Now, all she saw was a monster.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.666
Do you think he is a monster?

27:49.001 --> 27:51.003
[somber music playing]

28:27.907 --> 28:29.508
[breathing heavily]

28:29.541 --> 28:30.542
Oh.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.353
[dog barking]

28:44.223 --> 28:45.424
[wheezing]

28:49.829 --> 28:50.763
They are here.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.002
The Rus.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.938
Our scouts have spotted them.
They are coming over-ground.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.875
They will soon
arrive at Kattegat.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.145
You have prepared?

29:06.178 --> 29:09.015
[Erik] I have done everything
I possibly could.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.317
The arrival of King Hakon
and his forces

29:11.350 --> 29:15.054
have helped but we are still
massively outnumbered.

29:19.058 --> 29:22.428
I suppose we can only hope
to delay their final victory.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.397
So, you have just given up?

29:28.134 --> 29:30.970
There is no use
in pretending.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.274
The situation is bad.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.312
Made worse
because you will not be there

29:40.346 --> 29:42.882
-to lead any attack...
-Shh.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.794
Have you forgotten the gods?

29:56.728 --> 29:58.730
What is my name or yours,

29:58.764 --> 30:01.267
compared to that
of Odin and Thor?

30:01.300 --> 30:04.103
Do you suppose
they will just sit idly by

30:04.136 --> 30:06.906
as they watch followers
of the false Christ God

30:06.939 --> 30:08.740
slaughter and slay
their children,

30:08.774 --> 30:10.910
and cast their singing bones
to the wind?

30:11.643 --> 30:12.912
[chokes]

30:12.945 --> 30:13.946
[gasps]

30:15.114 --> 30:17.316
You are no true believer!

30:17.349 --> 30:21.220
Why don't you just walk out
of the gate, surrender?

30:21.253 --> 30:25.524
Is that what we have come to?
Is that how our world will end?

30:27.426 --> 30:28.427
[groans]

30:30.496 --> 30:31.497
[gasps]

30:35.301 --> 30:36.969
Forgive me.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.005
I... I am not worthy
to be mentioned

30:39.038 --> 30:40.907
in the same breath as you.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.942
But I promise I will give you
no more cause

30:42.975 --> 30:44.043
to be ashamed of me.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.283
Forgive me.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.532
This is yours.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.170
My King.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.011
[somber music playing]

31:36.428 --> 31:38.030
[indistinct chatter]

31:46.438 --> 31:47.773
[speaking in native tongue]

31:53.345 --> 31:54.346
[in English] Sword!

31:59.185 --> 32:01.087
[Ivar] This is King Hakon
of Norway.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.755
He has something to tell you.

32:05.591 --> 32:06.558
Go ahead.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.032
They're at the gates.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.270
But neither of us should lie.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.738
You are dying, my love.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.075
Your life slips away.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.778
You can have no part in this.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.050
Death is on its way.

32:33.052 --> 32:33.986
Don't weep.

32:35.221 --> 32:36.888
[Gunnhild weeps]

32:40.993 --> 32:42.094
[wheezes]

32:49.801 --> 32:52.038
Listen.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.140
Who can tell the saga
of Bjorn Ironside?

32:55.807 --> 32:58.110
Perhaps only Odin,
his ancestor.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.747
But unworthy as I am,
it falls to me.

33:06.585 --> 33:10.356
Bjorn Ironside is dead.

33:25.771 --> 33:26.838
Are you sure?

33:28.540 --> 33:29.841
Yes.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.844
I saw the body
with my own eyes.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.880
His wives
are lamenting over it.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.751
There is great sorrow
in Kattegat.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.453
[Gunnhild] They say the hearts
of women are turned

33:41.487 --> 33:43.089
on a whirling wheel...

33:43.122 --> 33:44.890
but my heart belonged to him.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.094
And when he died,

33:48.127 --> 33:49.628
the High One cried aloud.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.531
I don't understand.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.032
Why have you come here
to tell us?

33:58.504 --> 34:01.373
Great Prince,
Invincible Ruler,

34:01.407 --> 34:03.475
I throw myself
upon your mercy!

34:03.509 --> 34:05.611
Spare me
and I will serve you gladly

34:05.644 --> 34:07.079
all the days of my life.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.716
[Gunnhild] I knew him as a man.

34:10.749 --> 34:13.985
I knew his weaknesses,
and I knew his strengths.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.759
But if you ask me,

34:23.162 --> 34:25.431
will we ever see
his likes again,

34:27.333 --> 34:28.767
I would say no.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.717
Farewell, Bjorn Ironside.

34:47.586 --> 34:48.787
Farewell.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.205
Look after our guest.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.052
[chokes]

35:26.458 --> 35:28.093
[Oleg] Spread the good news.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.129
Let everyone rejoice.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.466
The great hero is dead.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.440
Kattegat is at our mercy.

35:45.076 --> 35:47.179
[intense music playing]

35:55.254 --> 35:56.455
[speaking in native tongue]

36:22.614 --> 36:24.182
[continues speaking
in native tongue]

36:40.299 --> 36:42.401
[in English] Perhaps we should
have made a sacrifice.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.872
I think a sacrifice
has already been made.

37:04.189 --> 37:06.558
[soldiers murmuring]

37:29.415 --> 37:31.116
[wheezes]

37:32.851 --> 37:35.120
[indistinct panicked chatter]

37:53.405 --> 37:54.406
[speaking in native tongue]

38:16.061 --> 38:18.063
[gasps and wheezes]

38:51.830 --> 38:53.965
[Gunnhild]
I knew him as a man.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.835
I knew his weakness
and his strength.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.940
But if you ask me, will we ever
see his like again...

39:04.676 --> 39:05.711
I would say no.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.684
[speaking in native tongue]

39:18.524 --> 39:21.460
[dramatic music playing]

39:21.493 --> 39:22.728
[indistinct panicked chatter]

39:26.632 --> 39:31.202
[in English]
I need you to help me
put my armor on one last time.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.173
And fetch my sword.

39:37.242 --> 39:38.209
Please.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.319
It's impossible.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.826
I told you, Ivar,
you can't kill him.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.128
He's not a god.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.229
[Hvitserk] Neither are you.

41:11.603 --> 41:12.638
[gasps]

41:15.140 --> 41:16.141
[horn blows]

41:18.176 --> 41:20.411
[Gunnhild] And so it happened,

41:20.445 --> 41:22.714
as my saga will tell...

41:22.748 --> 41:26.417
the Kings and Queens,
the Jarls and Earls of Norway

41:26.451 --> 41:29.988
answered the summons
of Bjorn Ironside,

41:30.021 --> 41:32.924
and came to save their country.

41:32.958 --> 41:36.728
For he was truly
the King of all Norway,

41:36.762 --> 41:38.630
and no one else
could have united

41:38.664 --> 41:40.265
all his people

41:40.298 --> 41:42.367
and brought them
to victory over the Rus.

41:54.212 --> 41:55.446
[all shouting]

41:57.849 --> 41:58.817
[shouts in native tongue]

42:02.353 --> 42:03.254
[Ivar in English] Retreat!

42:03.288 --> 42:05.724
Ha! Ha! Ha!

42:12.864 --> 42:14.900
[groans and grunts]

42:21.372 --> 42:22.207
[grunting]

42:29.648 --> 42:32.818
[both grunting]

42:36.154 --> 42:37.188
[groans]

42:50.268 --> 42:51.569
Farewell, my brother.

42:54.005 --> 42:56.141
It gladdens me to know
that Odin makes ready

42:56.174 --> 42:57.609
the benches for a feast.

42:59.577 --> 43:03.915
Soon you will be drinking ale
from curved horns.

43:14.359 --> 43:16.094
The Valkyries summon you home.

43:24.135 --> 43:25.236
[Gunnhild] Even in death...

43:26.537 --> 43:29.440
Bjorn Ironside was victorious.

43:29.474 --> 43:32.878
Which is one reason his name
will never be forgotten,

43:32.911 --> 43:35.781
nor will they ever cease
to sing of his exploits.

43:36.815 --> 43:39.117
He was the son of Ragnar,

43:39.150 --> 43:41.452
but in some ways
even greater than Ragnar,

43:41.486 --> 43:42.988
as the Seer foretold.

43:49.494 --> 43:52.297
The man who could not die
is buried here.

43:54.332 --> 43:55.600
But is still alive.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.777
Farewell, Bjorn Ironside.

44:12.517 --> 44:13.651
Farewell, my love.

44:14.652 --> 44:15.620
Farewell.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.927
Until we meet again.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.362
[solemn music playing]
