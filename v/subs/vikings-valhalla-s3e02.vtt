00:09.592 --> 00:11.511


00:45.003 --> 00:45.837
Emir.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.883
We have breached your barbican
and taken your city.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.093
Your castle is surrounded.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.971
I have come to ask for your surrender,

00:55.638 --> 00:59.392
to save your people
unnecessary suffering and death.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.899
A translator
is not necessary.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.484
I understand you perfectly.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.654
There will be no surrender.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.240
As we speak,

01:14.324 --> 01:18.578
a great Saracen army is on its way
from Cairo and Alexandria to join us.

01:19.496 --> 01:23.291
When it arrives it will be you
who is surrounded and destroyed.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.252
For your sake,
you should hope it arrives soon.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.254
We are not worried.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.925
We have food and supplies
to last us many months.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.009
But no water.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.013
Syracuse has six wells.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.432
I diverted water from five.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.769
Your supply will last a week at most.

01:43.978 --> 01:48.566
Perhaps your allies will reach you
and destroy us before that happens,

01:49.234 --> 01:51.569
or perhaps they won't and…

01:52.779 --> 01:54.364
Syracuse will perish.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.242
But either way…

01:58.618 --> 01:59.911
many will die.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.082
And all will suffer.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.677
Then I offer another solution.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.098
Single combat between two fighters.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.643
If you are victorious, Syracuse is yours

02:24.269 --> 02:27.605
and you have my promise
that my warriors will not retaliate.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.606
If you lose,

02:29.524 --> 02:31.776
you must depart and not return.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.905
Either way, my people must not be harmed.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.408
And who would your warrior be?

02:39.534 --> 02:40.368
Me.

02:41.744 --> 02:42.579
And yours?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.414
I fight for the Empire.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.582
No.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.591
You will fight my Varangian.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.893
And you have my promise.

03:05.727 --> 03:10.148
Your people will not be harmed
and our agreement, honored.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.635
Yes, higher. Yeah, good.

03:43.848 --> 03:44.682
Attack.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.976
Attack.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.603
Yes.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.646
Good.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.567
Block it, like this.

03:57.070 --> 03:57.904
What's that?

04:03.826 --> 04:05.328
Mother, watch me!

04:10.291 --> 04:12.460
Try again. You're getting better.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.047
I feel dizzy.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.883
How much mead did you drink yesterday?

04:19.968 --> 04:22.804
I saw you.
You are too young to drink so much.

04:24.013 --> 04:24.973
Go rest a while.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.523
And how do you feel this morning?

04:35.733 --> 04:36.859
I feel wonderful.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.036
It was a night to remember.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.706
That I don't remember.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.754
Hrefna, what are you doing up?

04:57.338 --> 05:00.383
You should be under furs
with that new husband of yours.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.093
Kolr's not feeling well.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.221
- I came to get water.
- He just needs to sleep off the mead.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.472
Here, Hrefna.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.362
Help! Help!

05:22.572 --> 05:23.573
Help!

05:25.408 --> 05:27.827
What is it?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.964
- How long has he been like this?
- What happened?

05:40.048 --> 05:40.965
I don't know.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.056
He's burning up. His heart is racing.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.642
What did he eat?

05:52.977 --> 05:55.104
Same as we all had
at the feast last night.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.568
Harald.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.533
- Show me the kitchen.
- Yes.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.703
This is where we cook.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.000
Where do you get supplies?

06:16.084 --> 06:19.420
We grow or catch everything we eat
except flour.

06:20.379 --> 06:21.422
We must trade for that.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.882
What kind of flour?

06:22.965 --> 06:23.800
Rye.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.843
We traded for it in Kattegat.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.017
What is it? Why are the gods angry at us?

06:33.101 --> 06:35.061
The gods had nothing to do with this.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.691
Fungi. It's very poisonous.
Someone put them in the flour.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.319
What will happen to us?

06:43.903 --> 06:44.987
There is a remedy.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.783
It may grow nearby,
but there isn't much time.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.159
Show these to Freydis.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.286
Tell her I will be back.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.418
He's shaking and can't keep it down.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.088
It happened so fast.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.467
Freydis, you need to see this.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.388
- Now?
- Yes.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.978
Okay, I am… I'll be back.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.544
Is this your first visit to Kattegat,
Lord Magnus?

07:42.753 --> 07:44.672
No, I was here as a boy.

08:33.596 --> 08:37.308
King Svein of Norway, son of Canute.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.562
My name is Magnus Olafsson.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.023
Magnus,

08:45.316 --> 08:46.400
son of Olaf.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.489
It was with your father
that I first bloodied my sword.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.494
What brings you to Kattegat
after all these years?

08:57.036 --> 08:57.954
My father.

08:58.996 --> 09:03.125
I've come to Kattegat to seek permission
to erect a shrine here in his name.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.128
I trust that is all
you intend to do while in Kattegat.

09:06.712 --> 09:07.797
Queen Aelfgifu.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.927
Forgive me. I did not see you there.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.389
You've grown up much
since I saw you last, Magnus.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.891
- Yet you have not changed a day.
- Hmm.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.311
Norway agrees with you.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.730
When it hasn't tried to kill me.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.277
What has truly brought you
to Kattegat, Magnus Olafsson?

09:30.778 --> 09:33.489
Anything to do with taking the throne
from my son?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.783
Dear Queen, look at my army.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.832
No, a miracle has occurred
in England in my father's name.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.125
A miracle?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.546
Jarl Olaf appeared to a blind monk
in a dream, my lord.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.880
When he awoke the next day,

09:49.964 --> 09:51.966
his sight had been restored.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.595
The Holy Father in Rome has proclaimed
that if a second miracle occurs,

09:55.678 --> 09:57.054
Jarl Olaf is to be sainted.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.307
The first Viking saint.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.017
Saint Olaf.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.437
Well, that would be a miracle.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.403
If we were in Novgorod,

10:12.486 --> 10:16.240
I could sell a thousand seats
and make enough to retire.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.464
Good luck, Harald.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.354
We can select three weapons.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.358
I'll start with the battle axe.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.531
You're quiet, which means
you're worried about something.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.116
I worry you underestimate him.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.828
I underestimate no man
who's trying to kill me.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.331
We'll both be fighting for our lives.

11:06.582 --> 11:07.792
No, only you will be.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.836
He is fighting for his people.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.254
As am I.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.255
What people?

11:14.382 --> 11:15.591
Yours? Or Romanos's?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.218
I fight for the same reason

11:17.301 --> 11:19.387
I've been fighting
for the last seven years.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.013
For treasure.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.015
So I can return to Norway

11:23.099 --> 11:26.102
and assume the throne of my people,
which is rightfully mine.

11:26.852 --> 11:27.937
Nothing else.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.567
Then I am glad to hear it.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.697
Because one of you will die today.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.785
And that death should mean something.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.541
Get Stígr.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.042
There are so many.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.259
Stígr!

12:07.143 --> 12:07.977
Stígr!

12:12.773 --> 12:13.649
Gunn!

12:26.078 --> 12:28.414
- Did you find Stígr?
- He ran.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.999
We found these.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.002
- They were put in the flour.
- Stígr poisoned us.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.006
Stígr? Why?

12:37.089 --> 12:40.301
I don't know, but he refused to eat
the bread last night.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.890
Destroy him!

14:16.605 --> 14:17.439
Kill him!

16:59.601 --> 17:01.937
So you were raised
in my father's court in London?

17:04.481 --> 17:05.524
I am envious.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.277
Don't be. He had little time for me.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.073
I was raised by his huscarl guards.
Many who knew my father.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.328
I was with Olaf in the end.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.707
He fought bravely against Freydis.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.668
But she was too fast.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.214
Why did she spare you?

17:31.091 --> 17:34.344
Because she is a woman with intelligence,
as well as feelings.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.724
When Freydis returned Svein to me,
she asked only one thing in exchange.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.101
Peace.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.979
And I intend to keep that promise.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.610
You have mistaken my motives,
Queen Aelfgifu.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.695
I come in peace as well.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.407
Uh, since you trade with Jomsborg,

17:55.491 --> 17:58.577
I was hoping you could provide me
an introduction to Freydis.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.456
So that I may fulfill
my Christian obligation to the Pope.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.249
And what obligation is that?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.376
- To retrieve his body.
- In Jomsborg?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.714
The church cannot allow
the first saint of Scandinavia

18:10.798 --> 18:13.258
to lie buried in a pagan stronghold.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.760
Well…

18:15.886 --> 18:17.304
that can easily be arranged.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.099
When do you travel to Jomsborg?

18:20.182 --> 18:21.517
Soon, Your Highness.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.310
Very soon.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.274
I see that you are with child.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.777
Is it your first?

18:33.070 --> 18:33.904
Yes.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.241
And if it is a boy,

18:37.866 --> 18:39.493
we will name him Canute

18:40.452 --> 18:42.454
after his grandfather.

18:43.914 --> 18:44.957
That's a fine name.

18:47.876 --> 18:48.710
To Canute!

18:49.461 --> 18:51.880
To Canute!

18:51.964 --> 18:54.299
Present and future.

19:08.063 --> 19:08.897
Enter.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.112
Ah, boatswain.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.532
Have you had good trading in Kattegat?

19:18.615 --> 19:20.242
I have, Lord Magnus.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.330
I was able to get an excellent price
for the wares you entrusted me with.

19:31.795 --> 19:32.796
Excellent.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.377
He has stopped shivering.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.005
But his breathing is becoming fainter.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.174
I'm afraid…

20:18.008 --> 20:19.092
he is dying.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.393
-

20:41.073 --> 20:46.119
Your Holiness,
thank you for seeing me.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.038
Welcome, my child.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.918
You must speak
to the Holy Father through me, Queen Emma.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.419
I will permit it.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.754
But I will not.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.174
Tis a precedent we don't wish to set.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.762
Tell us why you're here, my child.

21:04.763 --> 21:09.059
I fear my husband has yet to demonstrate
his value to His Holiness.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.646
Your husband has demonstrated himself
to be a savage.

21:12.729 --> 21:16.191
He claims to be Christian,
but he has no deference to the Church.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.150
I beg to differ.

21:18.068 --> 21:21.280
The Bishops of England
believe him not only a devout Christian

21:21.363 --> 21:25.409
but a generous donor
to both the Church and all its servants.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.995
Your husband's attacks on England
are well known

21:28.787 --> 21:30.539
and his meeting with His Holiness

21:30.622 --> 21:34.376
has demonstrated
his tendency for aggression.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.296
With England, he was righting a wrong
against his people.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.630
With violence.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.924
Sometimes there's a need for such a remedy

21:41.008 --> 21:43.969
where no other method
of change is available.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.723
The Church should be grateful
to have such a powerful ally…

21:48.432 --> 21:49.308
in times of need.

21:52.060 --> 21:55.022
The Church
does not make allies with savages.

21:55.105 --> 22:00.068
Yet you readily agree
to such an alliance with Earl Godwin,

22:01.194 --> 22:04.156
for which you've received
300 solidi, Cardinal.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.913
Earl Godwin is an emissary
of the Court of England, Your Holiness,

22:11.997 --> 22:17.377
and as your counsel I was only seeking
to establish a line of communication.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.047
As am I.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.923
But I'm afraid

22:22.007 --> 22:24.343
you don't speak for England,
Your Highness,

22:25.552 --> 22:28.180
and your time with the Holy Father
has expired.

22:39.691 --> 22:40.525
Amen.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.862
Please convey my wish

22:44.654 --> 22:48.867
that your husband continue
his most generous service.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.992
I'm glad
to see you're recovering.

23:32.911 --> 23:37.958
Harald, I am under no illusion
that your heart is still in the North.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.879
That you fought for the Empire
on my behalf…

23:44.005 --> 23:45.173
will not be forgotten.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.718
I was honored by your trust in me.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.680
A deserved trust.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.202
Safe journey, Your Eminence.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.996
Georgios Maniakes,

24:16.079 --> 24:19.249
without your help our success in Sicily
could not have happened.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.208
Thank you.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.212
Ensure your men
have the full two days of pillage.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.257
The destruction of Syracuse castle

24:27.340 --> 24:30.135
will not rid the Empire
of the Saracen menace.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.429
We should be doing more.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.975
I gave the Emir my promise,
his people are to be treated with respect.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.769
My word is law.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.648
As you command.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.026
Lead the way!

25:06.421 --> 25:08.006
You may tell them we are ready.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.928
Your Highness,
perhaps we should wait for Cardinal--

25:13.011 --> 25:14.846
I do not wish to wait.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.519
If it suits,
Your Holiness,

25:21.603 --> 25:25.190
the King has asked
that we resume negotiations.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.695
I do not claim to have
your sophistication, Your Holiness.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.574
I speak with actions
more than I speak with words.

25:34.658 --> 25:37.744
Deeds are what define my people.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.795
I came to Rome to establish
a bond of friendship with you.

25:47.295 --> 25:50.507
And I apologize if my frustrations
the other day upset you.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.723
Thank you.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.142
Upon reflection,

26:01.893 --> 26:04.854
my wife has encouraged me
to offer you a personal gift.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.865
Something to demonstrate
that an alliance with a Viking

26:15.949 --> 26:17.909
is not something to be ashamed of,

26:18.994 --> 26:22.580
but can be a beneficial relationship.

26:54.070 --> 26:58.116
It is a difficult world
outside this palace, Your Holiness.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.959
And a Viking friend
is a good friend to have.

27:53.088 --> 27:56.591
His Holiness says
he accepts your generous offer

27:57.509 --> 27:59.594
and wishes to thank you for your most…

28:00.804 --> 28:02.472
thoughtful of gifts.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.615
It is the quarters of the Viking,
Leif Eriksson.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.660
The one who brought down
the barbican wall.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.340
Saracen writings.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.737
Freydis!

30:03.426 --> 30:06.513
Stop! What are you doing?
Stop. Get off her!

30:08.598 --> 30:09.682
You don't understand.

30:12.018 --> 30:12.852
I'm helping.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.104
More poison.
I saw you put it in her mouth.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.190
If I poisoned her, why would I come back?

30:17.273 --> 30:19.150
Wouldn't I just leave them all to die?

30:21.361 --> 30:23.780
Look in my bag. You'll see the remedy.

30:23.863 --> 30:25.365
Not a poison, not a mushroom.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.450
It's a tuber taken from the woods.

30:27.534 --> 30:30.620
It can save them. Start cutting it up.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.811
Kolr, you must take it.

30:56.020 --> 30:56.855
Please.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.735
You must help me give it to him.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.153
We must…

31:05.238 --> 31:06.990
We must make him take it.

31:07.740 --> 31:08.950
He is gone, Hrefna.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.035
Let him go.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.051
Come to see me off?

32:09.010 --> 32:09.844
How thoughtful.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.221
I have a gift for you to give to Freydis

32:12.305 --> 32:15.391
so she knows that you have come in peace
and have my blessing.

32:16.559 --> 32:18.603
I'm sure she
and her people will assist you

32:18.686 --> 32:20.480
in recovering your father's body.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.982
Thank you, King Svein.

32:23.858 --> 32:25.985
I shall give them
the respect they deserve.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.737
Just how much is that, Magnus?

32:29.155 --> 32:32.825
Your wit is razor-sharp,
Queen Aelfgifu.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.079
I know why my father
thought so highly of you.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.998
Your father thought highly
of no one but himself.

32:40.249 --> 32:42.377
I see that is a trait you have inherited.

32:49.676 --> 32:50.677
Let us go!

33:05.900 --> 33:06.985
Row!

33:07.068 --> 33:08.736
Pray that he does not return.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.281
Mother, he is on a voyage of honor.

33:13.574 --> 33:18.162
Magnus does not know
what honor is, only opportunity.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.207
Your grandfather made a deal with Olaf
when you became king.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.459
In exchange for Olaf's protection,

33:24.127 --> 33:26.796
Magnus would one day
take the Throne of Norway.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.091
But only after I'm dead.

33:31.884 --> 33:32.927
Exactly.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.598
I'm not worried about Magnus, Mother.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.017
I have an army.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.311
All he has is a boat full of priests.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.863
Bring a gale, a storm.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.782
Even a sea monster.

33:56.993 --> 33:59.579
Anything so that you never return.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.376
Thank you.

34:06.085 --> 34:06.919
Thank you.

34:09.088 --> 34:09.922
This one is ready.

34:10.006 --> 34:13.217
I've prepared for our journey
back to England, Your Highness.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.678
Word has been sent ahead
to your brother, my lady,

34:15.762 --> 34:18.264
that we will be stopping
in Normandy on route.

34:18.347 --> 34:19.807
Thank you, Godwin.

34:20.183 --> 34:23.227
However, you will not be joining us.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.396
I'm sending you to Denmark

34:26.022 --> 34:28.107
to relay our agreement here to my father.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.276
As you wish, Your Highness.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.362
I look forward
to seeing my wife's heritage.

34:33.446 --> 34:34.280
I doubt that.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.283
But you are part of my family now.

34:37.366 --> 34:38.951
Your children have Viking blood.

34:39.869 --> 34:42.038
It will be not hurt you
to see where that came from.

34:45.666 --> 34:49.045
It was being a Viking
that won your victory here today, my lord.

34:49.128 --> 34:51.089
I see I still have much to learn from it.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.300
I agree. Safe journey.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.107
Where are you taking this?

35:19.158 --> 35:21.744
Here.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.016
Stop!

35:47.979 --> 35:48.813
Leave!

35:50.648 --> 35:52.316
Now.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.035
Are you the Librarian?

36:47.747 --> 36:51.751
Yes. You speak Arabic?

36:52.585 --> 36:53.502
I do.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.255
I do not come to destroy, but to save.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.723
Do you recognize this mark?

37:05.806 --> 37:08.684
Yes. It's <i>The Book of the Unknown.</i>

37:09.644 --> 37:10.728
Show it to me.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.192
How have you heard of this book?

37:17.276 --> 37:20.363
A <i>katib</i> in Egypt told me of it.

37:20.446 --> 37:21.948
Many believe it unholy

37:23.032 --> 37:26.827
for it questions
much of what is believed to be sacred.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.037
Not just to Muslims,

37:29.038 --> 37:30.039
but Christians as well.

37:30.623 --> 37:34.961
I don't believe
in any of those faiths, only truth.

37:47.473 --> 37:48.808
<i>The Book of the Unknown.</i>

38:27.054 --> 38:28.347
Food!

38:30.433 --> 38:32.184
Food.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.939
What do you search for?

39:19.023 --> 39:19.940
A map.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.069
A place that is important to me.

39:23.986 --> 39:27.698
They are all of unknown places.
How will you know it?

39:28.282 --> 39:30.826
It will look different
from all of the others.

39:36.582 --> 39:37.625
Is that the one?

39:40.628 --> 39:42.213
I'm not sure what I'm looking at.

39:42.713 --> 39:45.508
There is no north or south,
there's no way to orient myself.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.176
Where is this from?

39:47.259 --> 39:50.096
Like many in this book,
its maker is a mystery.

39:51.138 --> 39:53.808
But it was brought here from Corfu.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.735
We are ready.

40:06.362 --> 40:07.196
Do it.

40:22.837 --> 40:23.921
Release!

41:11.760 --> 41:13.012
No, no, no, no.

41:14.763 --> 41:15.764
No!

41:29.904 --> 41:30.821
No!

41:34.700 --> 41:37.745
No! No! No!

41:41.582 --> 41:44.084
No! No! No!

41:50.132 --> 41:51.091
Something's wrong.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.345
Get me my horse! Quick!

42:08.275 --> 42:09.109
Please.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.239
Please.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.676
Maniakes!

42:37.096 --> 42:37.972
Stop him!

42:46.063 --> 42:47.523
Hold him there.

42:49.108 --> 42:49.942
Stop!

42:50.943 --> 42:54.196
How could you do this? Women and children?

42:54.488 --> 42:55.656
Our enemy.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.241
The Emperor gave his word.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.868
To a dead man.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.370
To his people.

43:01.453 --> 43:04.081
Saracens are like vermin.

43:05.332 --> 43:09.003
If you do not destroy them,
they will multiply and spread,

43:10.045 --> 43:12.172
and soon wipe out Christianity.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.759
I did what the Emperor could not.

43:16.719 --> 43:17.845
You murdered them.

43:21.473 --> 43:24.643
No, Leif Eriksson, you did.

43:26.395 --> 43:29.315
It was your science that was the weapon.

43:29.523 --> 43:32.192
Your imagination that did this.

43:32.276 --> 43:33.152
I…

43:34.320 --> 43:36.071
was just the messenger.
