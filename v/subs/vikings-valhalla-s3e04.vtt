00:41.374 --> 00:43.877
Stígr, have you ever killed a man?

00:45.503 --> 00:46.337
Yes.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.257
Why do you ask?

00:49.799 --> 00:51.634
I've never seen you fight that way.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.473
Each fight is different.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.518
You do what you must do when you have to.

01:07.484 --> 01:11.905
Freydis. I hear the cries for the dead.

01:13.740 --> 01:18.495
I am too weak to run,
but not too old to fight.

01:20.038 --> 01:25.126
Leave me behind with an axe
and save the others.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.964
No. I'm leaving no one behind.

01:54.239 --> 01:59.786
Bless this divine mission
of beatification and conversion, oh Lord.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.871
Bless your Holy Vessel.

02:02.789 --> 02:06.543
Guide him as he labors to convert
souls to Your Kingdom--

02:06.626 --> 02:07.877
Enough.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.547
- The liturgy cannot be rushed.
- It's over.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.719
Trebuchets are unguarded
and they are burning the dead.

02:16.803 --> 02:17.679
How many remain?

02:18.388 --> 02:19.931
I counted 20.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.433
There may be more,
but they are clearly weakened.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.478
Then it appears we have arrived
just in time.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.650
Yes. Yes, we did arrive just in time.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.694
Open the barrels!

02:36.197 --> 02:40.577
Today we come to free my father's body
from its earthly bondage.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.999
From the heathen soil where it has
cried for justice for seven long years.

02:46.082 --> 02:50.628
Today you will complete this mission
of ending the Pagan age.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.965
Today you will destroy Jomsborg!

02:59.262 --> 03:00.805


03:31.544 --> 03:35.590
It is the great Harald Sigurdsson!
Care to join us?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.092
Join you doing what?

03:39.218 --> 03:40.845
Bullying your generals around?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.098
It doesn't look like you need my help.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.143
I think you're scared to fight me.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.813
Scared? Of you?

03:54.901 --> 03:57.070
I'm only scared
of what the Emperor would do

03:57.153 --> 04:00.156
when I robbed him
of his second best general.

04:03.076 --> 04:08.289
Someday, Viking, your quick tongue
will not be quick enough to save you.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.294
We'll see.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.221
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.974
We have approved the new recruits
for the Varangian Guard.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.769
- They are ready for your review.
- Spatharokandidatos, may I speak with you?

04:32.063 --> 04:33.481
Good morning, Empress.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.194
I need you to escort me to my chambers.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.869
Empress, this is not the way
to your chambers.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.332
What are you doing?

04:53.001 --> 04:54.419
You know.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.589
This is dangerous.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.342
And you are Spatharokandidatos,

05:02.093 --> 05:04.762
the second most powerful man
of the Empire.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.058
Show me what you want.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.853
Tell me what you need.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.906
I want you.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.131
Emperor, may I help you?

05:41.507 --> 05:44.427
I was looking for the Empress.
I thought I heard her voice.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.637
She was here,

05:46.721 --> 05:49.474
but I believe she went
back to her quarters.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.938
Actually, she is waiting for you
in the garden, Emperor.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.107
I escorted her there.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.241
Thank you, Harald.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.341
Huh?

06:23.424 --> 06:26.302
We have fought alongside you for years.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.263
We have followed you always,

06:29.347 --> 06:32.975
but this is the most dangerous thing
you have asked of us.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.359
I ask nothing of you.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.386


07:34.954 --> 07:36.164
Take the nun.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.665
Stop! In the name of God, no!

08:28.257 --> 08:29.425
What is your name?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.095
Niketas.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.518
Do you wish to say a prayer
over the graves?

08:38.601 --> 08:40.978
No. Come and eat. You must be hungry.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.376
You know, he could have killed you.

09:03.459 --> 09:04.752
We do not know that.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.797
And I will not play God,
speculating his intentions.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.840
You think God saved you?

09:10.424 --> 09:11.801
Maybe you were sent by him.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.512
I'd be the last person he would send.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.185
You're wounded. I need to wrap that.

09:22.645 --> 09:26.482
I'll do it.
Get me some cloth and some ale.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.701
The ale.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.171
What sort of nun are you?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.091
A thirsty one.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.262
My name is Tamar.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.763
Leif.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.141
When you're ready,

10:00.224 --> 10:03.311
I'll take you down to the nearest town
where you will be safe.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.730
If I was looking for safe,
I wouldn't be here.

10:06.939 --> 10:11.193
God doesn't send his servants to places
that are warm and comfortable.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.697
I have a purpose here.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.118
To restore this house of God.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.202
Well…

10:21.495 --> 10:23.706
If you don't need my help,
I'll go on my way.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.292
But I do need your help.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.545
With my wound,
I cannot carry water to mix the mortar.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.175
The spring is behind the church,
and the day's not getting any longer.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.593
I suggest we get started.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.119
What are those for?

11:03.162 --> 11:07.583
Offerings to their gods,
and warnings that death lies inside.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.479
What horrible plague befell them?

11:30.564 --> 11:32.733
Not a plague. Me.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.118
Spread out! Look for survivors!

11:58.801 --> 12:00.469
"Keeper of the Faith."

12:51.395 --> 12:53.272
We should be looking for your father.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.361
He's not going anywhere.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.918
This was my father's axe.

13:18.839 --> 13:19.924
We found someone.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.666
I'm looking for the woman called Freydis.

13:55.459 --> 13:56.627
She's dead.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.672
She died of the sickness.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.181
Do you recognize this axe?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.268
This is Olaf's axe.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.647
I was there
when Freydis killed him.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.070
What happened to his body?

14:24.613 --> 14:26.073
It is outside the gates.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.871
In the Valley of the Dead
with the other Christians she killed.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.378
The Valley of the Dead.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.801
Now, you are going to take me there.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.428
Bring her.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.354
Where are you heading?

14:57.438 --> 14:58.314
Corfu.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.524
And what is there that you seek?

15:02.526 --> 15:03.444
A man.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.862
Who is this man to you?

15:06.447 --> 15:07.823
You ask a lot of questions.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.783
We can take turns.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.918
What sort of nun drinks ale
and knows stonemasonry?

15:19.793 --> 15:21.253
One who was not always a nun.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.297
You were a mason?

15:23.380 --> 15:25.758
My husband was. I learned from him.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.886
We worked together in a town in the south.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.721
Now my turn. The man you seek?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.058
A mapmaker.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.936
What do you want with him?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.312
An answer to the unknown.

15:43.734 --> 15:44.860
When I was young…

15:46.111 --> 15:48.697
my father took me on a voyage
to the north.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.158
The ship got blown off course in a storm.

15:52.534 --> 15:56.205
When the clouds cleared in the morning,
I saw something on the horizon.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.835
A line of tall trees,
golden in the sunrise.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.464
I'm from Greenland.
I'd never seen trees before.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.178
When I went to tell my father…

16:13.013 --> 16:15.975
the land vanished,
and I was the only one who had seen it.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.188
For a long time,
I would lay awake at night

16:21.271 --> 16:23.899
and try to remember what it looked like.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.238
I would describe it to my sister
to keep the image alive in my mind.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.783
But finally…

16:34.451 --> 16:37.579
I came to believe I had imagined it.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.167
You want to know if it's real?

16:45.004 --> 16:45.879
Yes.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.468
And where is he now?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.220
Who?

16:53.303 --> 16:54.221
Your husband.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.266
Clearly, he's not here.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.937
We need more stones.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.608
My horse!

17:34.261 --> 17:35.095
Well?

17:36.764 --> 17:37.848
Not much further.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.480
I think that you are lying.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.691
Lord Magnus!

19:07.813 --> 19:08.647
Fast!

19:10.774 --> 19:13.026
Move! Quickly!

19:23.912 --> 19:25.164
It is Olaf.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.299
A sign. Written in Latin.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.351
We have two boats! Hurry!

19:47.769 --> 19:51.064
<i>"Stultitia patris</i>
<i>vivit in filio."</i>

19:52.482 --> 19:56.987
"The foolishness of the father
lives on in the son."

20:02.492 --> 20:03.493
This is a trap.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.787
They have not abandoned Jomsborg!

20:05.871 --> 20:07.539
We have checked everywhere.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.292
Not everywhere, not the dead!
Back to Jomsborg!

20:10.375 --> 20:11.585
Move!

20:16.965 --> 20:17.799
Freydis!

20:24.556 --> 20:26.183
Oars out now!

20:27.517 --> 20:28.352
Faster!

20:28.435 --> 20:30.896
Come on, children.
Get on! Sit down!

20:32.314 --> 20:34.775
Come on! Row! Row!

21:06.640 --> 21:09.851
- Get on! Come on!
- Faster!

21:10.227 --> 21:11.645
They're coming!

21:14.606 --> 21:15.857
They're coming!

21:17.484 --> 21:19.069
Row!

21:25.075 --> 21:26.785
Faster!

21:35.877 --> 21:38.005
Row!

21:39.006 --> 21:40.299
Put your backs into it!

21:47.389 --> 21:50.017
It's too late to surrender now, Freydis!

21:50.100 --> 21:53.979
You may have killed my father,
but you will not escape me!

21:54.688 --> 21:57.774
Your people will be forced
to pay for your sins!

21:58.650 --> 22:01.445
I am not surrendering to you, Magnus!

22:02.487 --> 22:04.573
I am destroying you!

22:05.949 --> 22:06.867
Now!

22:12.372 --> 22:14.416
Left! Hard left!

22:54.289 --> 22:56.291
Freydis!

22:58.126 --> 22:59.920
You should have let me kill him.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.965
So you can sleep without worry?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.634
I stopped you from killing him

23:05.717 --> 23:07.969
because forgiveness
is Christ's greatest gift.

23:10.847 --> 23:13.642
Well, out here…

23:15.936 --> 23:17.479
that gift will get you killed.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.777
Do you not believe in God? Any god?

23:25.946 --> 23:30.659
I have seen more death and hatred
caused by religion than any other source.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.619
I didn't ask about religion.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.496
I asked about God.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.457
A force greater than you.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.709
Wiser than you.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.546
Capable of forgiveness.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.801
Any god capable of forgiving me
would be a fool.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.637
I don't worship fools.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.642
We all carry the burden of our mistakes.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.523
He left me, my husband.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.359
He left me because…

24:07.195 --> 24:08.488
I killed our child.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.913
When he was away…

24:18.748 --> 24:22.085
raiders attacked our village
and killed many.

24:23.461 --> 24:27.924
When they reached our house,
I hid beneath the floor with our son.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.554
He was only a few months old.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.183
And he had to cry.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.771
Babies cry.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.484
To quiet him…

24:48.111 --> 24:49.196
I…

24:50.488 --> 24:52.616
covered his little mouth with my hand.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.954
But the man wouldn't leave.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.214
And he wouldn't stop crying.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.220
So, my hand pressed firmer.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.605
When they finally left, I was alive.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.568
But my child was dead.

25:32.656 --> 25:36.993
My husband tried to forgive me,
but he could not.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.082
Neither could the people from my village.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.005
You think…

25:50.548 --> 25:51.758
your god forgave you?

25:54.261 --> 25:55.095
No.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.557
I believe He helped me forgive myself.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.461
Tostig! Harold!

26:28.545 --> 26:31.965
Come on. Let's celebrate. Come.

27:08.251 --> 27:09.878
We gather here…

27:11.379 --> 27:13.506
under the branches of the origin tree…

27:14.674 --> 27:18.386
to thank it for its protection
from the Wends.

27:19.846 --> 27:25.477
From its roots, our ancestors believed,
grew everything we know and love.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.732
You remember the stories
I told you of the great Tree of Life?

27:31.232 --> 27:32.650
This is that tree.

27:32.734 --> 27:36.738
It has endured many things,
just as our people have…

27:38.323 --> 27:41.868
like our roots are deep and strong.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.038
Let it be a lesson to us all.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.629
Come.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.047
Boys, come on.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.131
Grandfather!

27:56.341 --> 27:57.592
Gytha!

28:07.227 --> 28:08.186
Earl Godwin.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.439
Welcome to Denmark.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.528
King Canute was able to receive
the papal blessing

28:16.611 --> 28:20.156
on three counties in the south,
which have been in dispute with the Wends.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.827
His word and the word of the church
defend this agreement.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.578
Excellent.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.250
So tell me, did you meet the Pope?

28:32.877 --> 28:33.711
Yes.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.006
And is he a big man?

28:37.715 --> 28:39.384
Of fair height and weight.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.679
And what kind of axe
does he use in combat?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.433
A big one like mine or a small hand axe?

28:47.392 --> 28:48.893
Or perhaps he's a swordsman.

28:48.977 --> 28:53.064
Your point is well-taken, Your Highness,
but the Wends are now Christian,

28:53.148 --> 28:56.693
and they won't be able to resist
the pressure the church can bring to bear

28:56.776 --> 29:00.530
if they do not accede to his wishes.
Your son understands that.

29:01.948 --> 29:02.991
He made a good deal.

29:05.201 --> 29:08.121
A Viking in Rome.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.500
Meeting with the leader
of the Christian church.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.461
I would have liked to have seen that.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.672
He represented your people well.

29:19.215 --> 29:22.010
So have you, I'm told.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.845
He fought like a Viking.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.806
I have much to be thankful for here.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.558
A wife who is Viking…

29:29.601 --> 29:32.187
and two strong sons
who share your bloodline.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.609
And what do you think of my grandson here?

29:39.903 --> 29:42.697
He fancies himself to be heir
to the English throne.

29:45.784 --> 29:46.910
He fights like a king,

29:47.535 --> 29:50.955
but he knows very little about England,
and he will have competition.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.415
I am prepared for them.

29:53.082 --> 29:54.626
And have Godwin to advise me.

29:55.418 --> 29:58.213
I fought bravely against the Wends,
ask anyone.

29:58.296 --> 30:01.549
A king must be intelligent
as well as brave.

30:03.259 --> 30:05.637
A real king would have
anticipated their attack,

30:05.720 --> 30:07.263
and would have put up guards.

30:08.389 --> 30:09.808
And he must be tougher.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.520
When I was your age,
my father was King of Denmark.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.981
He was a poor king,
and the country suffered.

30:18.107 --> 30:21.486
And even though it was obvious
that I would be a much better ruler,

30:22.111 --> 30:23.822
he wouldn't relinquish the throne.

30:25.448 --> 30:28.409
I could have waited my turn
as my counselors wanted me to,

30:28.493 --> 30:30.203
but I chose a different path.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.164
I killed him.

30:37.544 --> 30:42.173
If you truly intend to rule,
you must be tougher.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.182
Prince Edward!

30:52.016 --> 30:54.602
Let us go for a ride in the country
before I depart.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.937
I'll go!

30:56.020 --> 30:58.356
No, Alfred. Your mother wants to see you.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.820
Come. One final trip with your guest.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.449
If you're worried…

31:09.951 --> 31:11.119
bring your guards.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.522
Alfred, where's your brother?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.649
He's out with Canute on a ride.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.862
I wanted to go with him,
but he wouldn't allow it.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.991
Said he only wanted to go with Edward.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.389
Why have my men pulled back?

32:13.473 --> 32:15.016
Because I told them to.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.354
It cost me surprisingly little
for them to abandon you.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.315
What do you intend to do?

32:24.192 --> 32:25.610
Calm yourself, Edward.

32:26.444 --> 32:30.198
If I had wanted to harm you,
I would have done so before now.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.578
Get down. Let us talk.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.224
You have made no mystery
of how you feel about me.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.060
Or your mother.

33:00.853 --> 33:04.357
Or your belief
that the crown of England…

33:05.608 --> 33:06.693
belongs to you.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.905
It does!
The throne belongs to the House of Wessex!

33:10.989 --> 33:11.864
Someday.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.325
But not now.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.706
And I sit on that throne
because of mistakes made by your father.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.251
The day will come, however,
when I will not.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.753
And when that day comes…

33:27.130 --> 33:29.882
perhaps one of my sons
will wear the crown.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.512
Perhaps you or your brother will.

33:36.431 --> 33:40.059
But whoever wears it
must realize something important

33:40.143 --> 33:41.728
or they will not wear it long.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.899
Thrones may be inherited…

33:49.277 --> 33:51.237
but kings are made.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.073
Your father understood this.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.367
So do I.

33:57.493 --> 33:59.912
Maybe one day you will too.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.877
Why have you told me this?

34:09.464 --> 34:10.965
Because your mother loves you.

34:12.508 --> 34:13.801
And I love your mother.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.346
And I do not like the way you treat her.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.891
She abandoned us.

34:19.974 --> 34:21.768
She did so to protect you.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.644
You are not safe in England.

34:24.729 --> 34:28.441
She did what she did
to give you a chance to survive!

34:31.402 --> 34:32.862
Do not punish her for that.

34:44.665 --> 34:48.086
If you want to be a king, behave like one.

34:49.170 --> 34:53.758
Else your pride and anger
will be the end of you.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.815
Why is it, Prince Yaroslav,

35:08.898 --> 35:12.360
that your visits are always accompanied
with requests for troops?

35:12.443 --> 35:15.863
Because the need for them
is still important.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.450
I can offer you 2,000 men. No more.

35:21.035 --> 35:23.746
I thought we were trying to solve
the Pecheneg problem.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.916
With 2,000 men,
I could barely scratch their balls.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.252
Five thousand is the minimum.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.337
I cannot spare that many.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.631
Then don't come asking for my help

35:33.714 --> 35:35.925
when the Pechenegs
are pissing on your walls.

35:36.425 --> 35:39.137
I will offer you 2,000 of my Varangians.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.932
Pound for pound, they are worth double
General Maniakes's men.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.101
And who will lead them, you?

35:45.184 --> 35:46.352
No.

35:47.478 --> 35:48.604
He is needed here.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.653
I must take my leave. Do we have a deal?

35:55.736 --> 35:57.196
We do.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.659
You have come a long way, Empress.

36:01.742 --> 36:06.664
I wonder, do you ever miss your old home
and your people in the north?

36:07.248 --> 36:09.041
This is my home now, Yaroslav.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.836
These are my people.

36:25.892 --> 36:30.313
Ah, nephew, I have forgotten
how wonderful Constantinople is.

36:31.397 --> 36:34.442
The art, the culture, the beauty.

36:38.487 --> 36:41.741
With all of this, I do not blame you
for forgetting your homeland.

36:42.825 --> 36:44.285
I've not forgotten Norway.

36:45.786 --> 36:49.457
Seven years ago, did I not tell you
I would come here and raise a fortune?

36:49.540 --> 36:51.751
So I could return home
and claim what's mine?

36:52.627 --> 36:53.586
Yes, you did.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.588
And over those years,

36:56.380 --> 37:00.468
have I not sent all that treasure
back to Novgorod for safekeeping with you?

37:01.093 --> 37:02.303
Dutifully.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.889
Then why do you doubt me?

37:06.390 --> 37:10.102
Because you have enough gold
to raise five armies!

37:10.895 --> 37:12.230
And here you still are.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.276
There are things here
I have yet to accomplish.

37:17.360 --> 37:22.114
Oh, yes, they have made you Sparticoticus!
Important man!

37:23.324 --> 37:24.659
Spatharokandidatos.

37:25.952 --> 37:29.538
And it is important.
I'm one step away from the Emperor.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.707
Ah.

37:32.667 --> 37:33.793
The Emperor…

37:43.803 --> 37:46.931
Harald, do you know the difference
between hunger and appetite?

37:49.016 --> 37:52.478
Hunger is what our body tells us we need.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.605
Appetite is what we want.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.150
I know the difference, Uncle.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.779
Many years ago, you asked me to tell you

38:02.613 --> 38:06.784
if I ever heard news about a woman
who disappeared into Jomsborg.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.039
Olaf asked me about her as well.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.918
It seems he located Jomsborg…

38:17.003 --> 38:18.713
and attempted to destroy it.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.509
And what happened?

38:24.093 --> 38:28.973
She killed him and all his men,
and now rules Jomsborg.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.854
She was always destined to be a ruler.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.446
A ruler with a seven-year-old child.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.785
Thank you, Uncle.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.413
I'm glad to learn this.

38:55.374 --> 38:59.295
But not enough to leave all this, hmm?

38:59.879 --> 39:01.422
Freydis chose her path.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.343
I've chosen mine.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.290
What do we do?

39:36.374 --> 39:39.377
We have no boats.
We have no way to return home.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.420
We are trapped!

39:43.422 --> 39:44.590
I have an idea.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.176
Go find the kitchen,

39:47.259 --> 39:49.637
bake yourself a large loaf of bread
and eat it.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.139
If that doesn't work…

39:53.516 --> 39:56.227
pray to Saint Olaf for a second miracle!

40:16.414 --> 40:18.124
You did it!

40:18.999 --> 40:19.875
No.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.294
We did it.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.428
What do we do now?

40:35.141 --> 40:38.394
Now we find a new home.

40:52.199 --> 40:54.243
I'm sorry to have taken your horse,

40:54.910 --> 40:56.996
but I needed to find my sister.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.165
This is Esther.

41:00.249 --> 41:01.208
We've come to help.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.044
Two more pairs of hands
to build your church.

41:05.754 --> 41:07.089
And I am most grateful.

41:23.105 --> 41:23.939
Come on, boys.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.243
Goodbye, Prince Edward.

41:37.411 --> 41:38.496
Goodbye, King Canute.

41:42.541 --> 41:43.626
Goodbye, Edward.

41:45.836 --> 41:49.131
Goodbye, Mother.
I look forward to your return.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.205
For you, my lord.

42:22.248 --> 42:23.415
I carved it myself.

42:27.753 --> 42:29.797
In the likeness
of who is this carved?

42:29.880 --> 42:32.007
It is the Viking god, Thor.

42:32.841 --> 42:35.553
I know that he inspired you
when you were a boy.

42:35.636 --> 42:39.014
He's holding his beard
and controlling the winds with his breath.

42:39.098 --> 42:41.725
May he provide you a good wind
for your journey home.

42:42.476 --> 42:45.437
It has been a long time
since I have thought of such things.

42:46.981 --> 42:50.776
I thank you for this gift,
William, Duke of Normandy.

42:51.485 --> 42:54.572
The blood of Rollo runs in your veins.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.661
May you draw strength from that.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.709
From one Viking to another.

43:08.460 --> 43:09.378
Thank you.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.440
Are you sure I cannot convince you
to stay for longer?

43:29.523 --> 43:33.319
No. I never want to lay
another stone again.

43:42.202 --> 43:44.204
Good luck finding your trees.

43:46.206 --> 43:48.834
What happens when you finish the church?

43:48.917 --> 43:50.210
I never saw a bell.

43:52.838 --> 43:54.965
When we finish, God will provide one.
