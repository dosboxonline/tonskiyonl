WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.871
[Ragnar]
Previously on Vikings...

00:03.904 --> 00:05.373
Wessex remains the last
great kingdom of England.

00:05.406 --> 00:07.508
Come with me,
and conquer King Alfred!

00:07.541 --> 00:09.477
[all chanting]
Hail Ivar! Hail Ivar!

00:09.510 --> 00:11.045
[Alfred]
We know these Northmen

00:11.079 --> 00:12.580
have a reputation
as savage warriors.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.182
But they are only human.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.417
Confronted by evil,
we do not surrender to it.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.485
We shall fight.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.886
We shall never surrender,

00:18.919 --> 00:20.554
whatever the cost!

00:20.588 --> 00:21.689
-[all cheering]
-[Saxon captain]
King Alfred!

00:21.722 --> 00:23.124
This is your doing.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.525
You chose your path.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.694
There is something
you can do for me.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.463
I want you to kill Ingrid.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.066
I know how to do it.
I know how to win.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.467
What are you going to do?

00:33.501 --> 00:34.935
I'm going to cripple them.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.738
It's a new world.

00:37.771 --> 00:38.939
[Torvi]
They've taken our gifts

00:38.972 --> 00:39.807
and replaced them
with new ones.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.443
Nobody is here.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.011
[all gasp]

00:46.214 --> 00:46.947
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:43.571 --> 01:44.538
[whispers] Stay with me.

01:49.643 --> 01:50.544
Keep together.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.438
Put down your weapons.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.940
They're not going to attack us.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.058
Peminuit.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.494
Torvi.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.797
Ragnar.

03:19.633 --> 03:23.604
[in Mi'kmaq]
We don't want to fight you.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.740
We would rather make peace.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.318
Come.

03:37.351 --> 03:42.155
Come and meet our sagamaw,
Pekitaulet.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.359
[in English] I think
he wants us to go with him.

03:48.028 --> 03:48.862
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.732
Then let's go.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.535
[murmuring indistinctly]

05:11.144 --> 05:12.346
[wind howling]

05:20.020 --> 05:21.221
Pekitaulet.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.961
[in Mi'kmaq]
Here are my family.

05:27.995 --> 05:31.164
My eldest son, Peminuit.

05:32.900 --> 05:37.037
His brother, We'jitu.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.042
And his wife, Nikani.

05:47.014 --> 05:51.151
You are strangers.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.221
We will give you assistance.

05:54.254 --> 05:59.126
We will make sure
that you do not starve.

05:59.159 --> 06:04.832
We will be friends with you,
and respect you.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.200
[baby crying]

06:07.234 --> 06:09.570
Oh. [shushing]

06:11.572 --> 06:12.406
Ragnar.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.743
-[baby crying]
-Oh.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.023
[baby continues crying]

06:46.073 --> 06:47.240
[cooing]

07:03.390 --> 07:04.725
Ow!

07:07.427 --> 07:09.062
[all laughing]

07:26.914 --> 07:28.248
[indistinct shouting]

07:32.419 --> 07:34.755
[Saxton captain 1]
Steady the horses. Good.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.991
Scouts, ride up
among those hills.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.392
See if there is any sightings

07:39.426 --> 07:40.894
or evidence of the Viking army.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.162
Yes, my Lord Alfred.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.098
Here! Here!

07:45.132 --> 07:47.000
[Saxton captain 2] You men!
I want you on the ridge now!

07:47.034 --> 07:48.936
It's a precaution.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.437
Even now, I suspect,

07:50.470 --> 07:51.772
Ivar's army will have
reached the Royal Villa.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.608
To find it deserted.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.276
Abandoned. The King fled.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.548
How greatly he will
enjoy setting it afire.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.817
My sweet Elsewith,

08:03.851 --> 08:06.219
you cannot fault me
more than I fault myself.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.722
It would have been
a braver thing

08:08.756 --> 08:09.823
to remain at the villa.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.358
I could have chosen martyrdom.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.893
We could all have died
with easy consciences.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.397
Forgive me,
I have chosen a harder path.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.132
I have chosen
to try and survive,

08:19.166 --> 08:22.670
and I cannot think
that God will blame me.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.372
And whether He blames me
or not, my mind is set.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.974
We will meet
Ivar's army at a time

08:27.007 --> 08:28.642
and place of our choosing.

08:28.676 --> 08:33.313
In this final battle,
which God knows I dread,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.616
I believe
we shall be victorious.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.186
If I did not believe it
with all my heart,

08:39.219 --> 08:40.854
then we would not be here.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.961
Amen.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.462
A thousand times, Amen.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.503
[Nissa] Here.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.152
[Erik sighs]

09:13.654 --> 09:15.455
Why don't you talk anymore?

09:15.488 --> 09:18.091
[Erik]
What is there to talk about?

09:18.125 --> 09:20.293
I am blind.
I cannot see.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.865
I do not know what is
happening around me.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.836
And you never share.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.706
Very well.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.543
If it means anything to you,

09:36.576 --> 09:38.011
amongst other things,

09:38.045 --> 09:39.780
I have dispatched
a trusted fellow

09:39.813 --> 09:41.448
to go to that place
in Denmark

09:41.481 --> 09:44.985
where the King has been
converted to Christianity.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.519
I thought
it was the least I could do.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.522
And what is this
"trusted fellow"

09:49.556 --> 09:50.958
supposed to do?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.028
Assassinate the King,
of course.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.532
We all have a duty
to preserve the old ways.

10:02.135 --> 10:02.970
[Erik scoffs]

10:08.709 --> 10:11.244
You take all the decisions.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.483
Would you have
objected to that?

10:17.384 --> 10:18.719
[scoffs]

10:21.054 --> 10:22.589
If I had objected,

10:22.622 --> 10:26.326
would it have made
any difference?

10:26.359 --> 10:27.194
-Hmm?
-[liquid sloshes]

10:40.808 --> 10:41.909
[thunder rumbling]

10:41.942 --> 10:43.376
[indistinct chattering]

10:46.880 --> 10:49.116
[viking] Place it down here
and cover it up.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.684
-[thunder rumbling]
-[crying]

10:57.524 --> 10:58.759
Orlyg.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.796
Go away.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.397
Why are you crying?

11:06.033 --> 11:07.667
How can things be
worse than this?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.005
We don't exist here.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.342
We have lost everything.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.847
I can be free.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.016
[chuckles] Really? How?

11:25.618 --> 11:28.722
I can be free if I do
something for Lord Erik.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.560
What do you have to do?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.330
I can't say.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.133
You better say it,

11:40.167 --> 11:43.403
because I want to be free, too.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.438
It's the only thing
that matters!

11:49.743 --> 11:52.445
I have to kill Queen Ingrid.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.755
Very well.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.126
Then we'll do it together.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.006
-How do we kill her?
-[chuckles]

12:19.039 --> 12:21.108
How do you want to kill her?

12:21.141 --> 12:22.209
I'm asking you.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.145
We can poison her.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.414
What poisons do you know?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.083
I don't know any poisons.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.385
Oh.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.688
We can stab her.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.090
Do you think?

12:37.124 --> 12:40.493
I think that is the best way.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.929
But Erik must be far away,

12:41.962 --> 12:44.264
and not involved.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.366
I'll get him to sleep with me.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.935
He does it all the time.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.603
He won't be there.

12:52.105 --> 12:56.209
Then it's just you and her.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.548
[loon calling]

13:04.484 --> 13:05.919
[Torvi] I like these people.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.256
I don't believe
they mean us any harm.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.559
I agree.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.894
I also think
we will need their help

13:13.927 --> 13:16.329
if we are to survive here.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.965
Then let's return
their hospitality

13:17.998 --> 13:19.099
and invite them to visit us.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.134
Yes, we should do that.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.638
The sagamaw spoke words
in our language.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.976
How is that possible?

14:25.398 --> 14:26.599
[in Mi'kmaq] Hello.

14:27.901 --> 14:28.801
Hello.

14:33.773 --> 14:34.841
Thank you.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.618
[indistinct chattering]

14:50.023 --> 14:52.592
[viking in English]
It is made of iron. Iron.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.364
[indistinct chattering
in Mi'kmaq]

15:10.843 --> 15:12.179
[indistinct chattering]

15:46.413 --> 15:47.447
[in native tongue] Iron.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.753

-[all exclaim]

15:59.359 --> 16:00.327
[laughter]

16:12.672 --> 16:15.275
[in English]
Everything is here.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.213
The story of myself.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.783
The story of my race.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.188
Here is where I was burned.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.790
The flames consumed me.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.626
Took away my skin,
then re-made me.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.262
In this image.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.398
In this form.

16:41.501 --> 16:45.338
But my heart is as old

16:45.372 --> 16:47.440
as your hearts, my friends.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.246
My heart is as old as wood.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.916
As old...

16:58.451 --> 17:00.053
as a tall tree...

17:03.690 --> 17:04.957
in the forest.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.496
[indistinct chattering]

17:11.298 --> 17:13.700
[in native tongue]
You can speak our language.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.968
We heard you.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.606
Do you understand?

17:23.443 --> 17:24.477
Happy.

17:25.678 --> 17:26.679
Happy.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.549
Happy.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.984
Who spoke to you?

17:33.286 --> 17:36.756
What man? What spirit?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.327
Who happy?

17:42.028 --> 17:43.730
Crazy.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.533
Crazy.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.235
Crazy man?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.671
Where is crazy man?

17:52.372 --> 17:53.406
Where?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.818
[in English]
Gold. Yes? Gold.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.056
[in Mi'kmaq] Gold.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.524
Gold.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.693
[in English] Where?

18:13.726 --> 18:14.794
Where is the gold?

18:15.862 --> 18:16.696
Where?

18:42.889 --> 18:45.458
What is it about the forests?

18:45.492 --> 18:48.428
[Leof] People go
into the forest
to collect mushrooms

18:48.461 --> 18:52.599
or capture a stray animal,
and they never return.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.435
[Galan] There are creatures
in the forest.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.837
Strange creatures who
spring up out of the ground

18:57.870 --> 19:00.006
if they hear your footsteps.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.774
The Devil himself
lives in the forest...

19:04.110 --> 19:06.012
and he walks
up and down in it.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.881
My Lord.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.318
Please, sit.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.485
You'll need your strength.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.660
Be of good cheer.
All of you.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.729
Put your faith in God,
and be not afraid.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.277
[birds chirping]

19:53.960 --> 19:54.794
Still warm.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.263
[grunts]

19:57.830 --> 19:58.831
[groans]

20:07.173 --> 20:08.508
Take it.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.179
[indistinct chattering]

20:31.498 --> 20:33.633
[Saxton captain 1]
Hold the line!

20:35.201 --> 20:36.168
Stay!

20:44.511 --> 20:46.145
Hold the line!

20:48.214 --> 20:49.582
Keep formation!

20:50.883 --> 20:52.952
Steady, I say!

20:52.985 --> 20:54.321
[Saxton captain 2]
On me, men!

20:57.357 --> 20:58.925
[Saxton captain 1] Go on,
and hold the line!

21:01.294 --> 21:02.795
[Saxton captain 2]
On me, men!

21:05.432 --> 21:06.733
[shouting indistinctly]

21:08.568 --> 21:09.836
[Saxton captain 1]
You let it fall!

21:09.869 --> 21:10.603
[Saxton captain 2]
Hold it! Hold it!

21:11.270 --> 21:12.472
[grunting]

21:16.075 --> 21:17.276
[grunting]

21:54.180 --> 21:55.415
Halt!

21:55.448 --> 21:56.816
[Saxon captain 1] Halt!

21:56.849 --> 21:58.117
[Saxon captain 2] Halt!

21:59.652 --> 22:01.120
[Saxon captain 1] Stand...

22:04.557 --> 22:05.792
fast!

22:17.437 --> 22:18.938
[horse neighing]

22:28.581 --> 22:30.349
-[Saxon captain 1] Swords!
-[Saxon captain 2] Weapons!

22:40.693 --> 22:42.962
-Guard the Queen.
-Yes, my Lord.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.230
-Protect the Queen.
-[soldier] Yes, my Lord.

22:44.263 --> 22:47.066
Line one, advance!

22:47.099 --> 22:48.968
[Harald]
I don't understand.
What do you mean

22:49.001 --> 22:50.870
you want to "cripple" them?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.539
If we kill 500 Saxons,

22:52.572 --> 22:56.208
then we just
kill 500 Saxons.

22:56.242 --> 22:57.777
[Harald] Hmm.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.947
If we manage to cripple
and injure 500 Saxons,

23:00.980 --> 23:03.616
but not to kill them,

23:03.650 --> 23:05.618
then it will take
1,000 more Saxons

23:05.652 --> 23:07.153
to come and rescue them.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.121
That is three times
the amount of warriors,

23:09.155 --> 23:10.590
and all at our mercy.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.126
Line Two! Advance!

23:14.160 --> 23:15.628
[Saxon captain 1]
Line Two! Advance!

23:17.029 --> 23:19.098
Third Line! Advance!

23:19.131 --> 23:20.833
[Saxon captain 1]
Line Three! Advance!

23:23.670 --> 23:25.438
But how can you be sure
that King Alfred

23:25.472 --> 23:27.474
will try to rescue them?

23:27.507 --> 23:29.275
[Ivar]
Because he's a Christian.

23:29.308 --> 23:30.677
He cares about them.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.488
[Saxon soldiers screaming]

23:45.558 --> 23:47.193
[screaming continues]

24:00.372 --> 24:02.008
[yelling and screaming]

24:05.745 --> 24:06.746
[horn blows]

24:07.279 --> 24:08.414

24:11.117 --> 24:12.885

24:15.387 --> 24:16.756
[soldiers continue screaming]

24:19.992 --> 24:22.394
[breathing heavily]

24:22.428 --> 24:24.163
Help them! Help them!

24:25.698 --> 24:28.434
Get them out! Help them!

24:28.467 --> 24:29.969
[screaming and yelling
continues]

24:33.940 --> 24:34.774
[squelching]

24:48.788 --> 24:50.189
What shall we do,
my Lord Alfred?

24:52.458 --> 24:54.393
My Lord, do we go
back or forward?

25:02.401 --> 25:03.870
[horn sounding]

25:04.737 --> 25:06.773
[yelling]

25:14.113 --> 25:15.615
Soldiers! With me!

25:16.549 --> 25:18.017
Advance!

25:18.050 --> 25:19.318
[soldiers yelling]

25:19.351 --> 25:20.687
To battle!

25:41.273 --> 25:43.475

[grunting]

28:47.960 --> 28:49.195

28:54.033 --> 28:55.968
Come out and fight,
you coward!

28:56.635 --> 28:57.703
Ivar!

28:57.736 --> 28:59.772
[Ivar] And then,

28:59.806 --> 29:02.674
when Alfred believes that
it cannot get any worse...

29:05.111 --> 29:06.278
I shall make it worse.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.614
I shall take his Queen.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.318
Impossible.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.986
She will be
heavily protected.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.755
How do we get past
the Queen's guard?

29:16.789 --> 29:17.824
I mean, it's--

29:17.857 --> 29:19.558
That's simple.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.162
We just walk right up
to them and take her.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.330
[grunting]

29:26.032 --> 29:28.267
-[gasping]
-[maid] Help us!
God help us!

29:28.300 --> 29:29.836
God help us!

29:29.869 --> 29:31.037
The Lord is with us,
my Lady.

Keep her still!
-[Elsewith screaming]

29:40.346 --> 29:41.580
[laughs]

29:42.849 --> 29:44.183
You are crazy.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.886
You truly are crazy.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.590
[gasping]

29:56.528 --> 29:57.529

31:55.014 --> 31:56.682
[battle noises resume]

32:08.594 --> 32:10.062
I can't see.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.597
I can't see anything.

32:12.498 --> 32:13.632
Now!

32:14.866 --> 32:16.802
[horn sounding]

32:18.837 --> 32:19.871
[Saxon captain] Fall back!

32:23.742 --> 32:24.810
Come on!

32:25.744 --> 32:26.979
Let's get out of here!

32:34.086 --> 32:35.087
[soldier] Which way?

32:39.091 --> 32:41.093
[panting]

32:48.867 --> 32:49.968
[chuckles]

32:52.904 --> 32:54.906
[breathing heavily]

33:05.817 --> 33:08.020
My Lord Alfred,
if I may advise you,

33:08.054 --> 33:09.521
now is the time
to retreat.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.623
We have found men
who know this place

33:11.657 --> 33:13.292
and can guide us safely
out of the plain.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.960
We will not retreat.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.296
My Lord, if we stay here,
I fear things may end badly.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.830
Lord, I beg you!

33:18.864 --> 33:20.299
You heard my command!
We shall not retreat.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.968
Why?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.470
Because Jesus Christ
is with us.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.737
I saw him.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.039
He is on the battlefield,

33:28.340 --> 33:30.042
and we will not
leave his side.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.389

34:27.933 --> 34:29.168
You are dying.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.140
Valhalla.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.007
Valhalla? [scoffs]

34:36.041 --> 34:37.209
There is no such place.

Hello, brother.

35:03.169 --> 35:09.508

was it?

[Orlyg grunts]

39:14.586 --> 39:15.987
