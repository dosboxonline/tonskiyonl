WEBVTT

00:23.481 --> 00:24.899
We are a simple people.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.610
We have nothing of value to rob.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.821
I did not come to take.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.782
I'm looking for someone.

00:33.783 --> 00:34.993
Magnus Olafsson.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.455
We've heard he's in the North

00:38.538 --> 00:41.207
and his soldiers have passed through
on their way to Stromsfoss.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.504
- How far is that?
- Not far.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.673
We are cutting wood for their meeting.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.144
Hold.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.347
You killed my sister.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.185
What's going on?

02:24.269 --> 02:25.812
Leif! Stop!

02:27.063 --> 02:28.064
It's me.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.919
So this is the Army

02:50.003 --> 02:52.630
that all of our fighting
helped you to purchase.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.050
Part of it. Destinies do not come cheap.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.014
How did you learn of Freydis?

03:02.140 --> 03:05.977
A bishop traveling with Magnus told me
that he poisoned Jomsborg.

03:06.978 --> 03:10.815
Some of her people escaped
and she was not among them.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.117
So you went there?

03:22.118 --> 03:23.328
On my way north,

03:23.912 --> 03:26.873
I found the shrine they had built for her.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.418
Nothing else.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.547
No sign of my child?

03:36.382 --> 03:37.216
No.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.555
It was her destiny to go there.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.351
I hope she found what she was looking for.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.436
Harald.

03:50.521 --> 03:54.067
If Magnus murdered my sister,
I will kill him.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.569
Not if I reach him first.

03:59.948 --> 04:00.865
Harald.

04:04.702 --> 04:05.662
Jarl Nori.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.040
- Welcome home.
- Vestian.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.212
And Greenlander, good to see you again.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.672
And you both.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.424
I knew you would return.

04:18.508 --> 04:22.470
I brought forces to back me
and riches for my allies.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.807
I'm ready to be king.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.061
May not be
as simple as you have planned.

04:30.812 --> 04:35.149
Magnus has agreements with many
of the Jarls to back him on Svein's death.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.443
He has the power of the Church.

04:38.236 --> 04:43.157
The Pope has threatened excommunication
for anyone who goes against him.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.493
Including you.

04:47.578 --> 04:48.871
And where do you stand?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.999
Olaf was like a brother to me.

04:51.082 --> 04:55.503
But his son is a Viking in name only.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.758
Our allegiance is with you.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.261
I'm glad to hear that.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.054
Do you know where Magnus is?

05:05.972 --> 05:09.183
No, but he has summoned
the Jarls to Kattegat.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.146
Then that is where we're going.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.510
Thank you.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.833
My God! Freydis!

06:18.336 --> 06:19.712
Queen Aelfgifu.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.547
We heard you were dead.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.008
Magnus claimed a plague
had stricken Jomsborg.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.468
Is he in Kattegat?

06:25.551 --> 06:28.971
No, he's trying to turn
the Jarls against Svein.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.765
My son is hunting him now.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.645
This is my daughter-in-law, Katla.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.647
Svein's wife?

06:38.856 --> 06:40.108
Congratulations, Katla.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.068
You're expecting.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.444
Thank you, Freydis.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.656
I have heard much about you
and your child by Prince Harald.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.699
It is a romantic story.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.743
That was a long time ago.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.120
Much has changed.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.747
And how is your son?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.332
He is well in Greenland.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.378
Magnus forced me to find
a new home for my people.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.421
We got as far as Greenland.

07:03.422 --> 07:06.217
But I need a boat
and a sea captain to get us further.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.678
A boat and a captain?

07:09.971 --> 07:13.975
Then we are the bearers
of some very good tidings.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.784
This is Leif's?

07:32.493 --> 07:33.870
Canute gave it to him

07:34.454 --> 07:36.247
so that he may explore new worlds.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.667
New worlds? Where is he now?

07:39.750 --> 07:43.337
When he heard that you were poisoned,
he went after Magnus to kill him.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.631
Then I must find him.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.384
He's somewhere in the North.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.304
You would do better to wait for him here

07:51.387 --> 07:54.140
so as not to miss him when he returns.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.730
My Earls.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.984
In the years that I have been your king,

08:06.027 --> 08:09.697
I have given you stability.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.575
And providence.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.828
Even in death,

08:16.579 --> 08:18.372
I prepared for the same.

08:19.540 --> 08:25.838
Therefore, I decree that after my passing,

08:26.631 --> 08:30.927
my wife, Queen Emma,

08:32.178 --> 08:33.763
will be your ruler.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.396
What say you?

08:47.443 --> 08:48.528
My lord.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.491
Sussex swears to uphold your decree.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.995
East Anglia promises
to uphold your decree.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.789
- As does Kent.
- As does Wiltshire.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.249
As does Mercia.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.626
- Wimbledon agrees.
- As does York, my lord.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.839
Wessex upholds your decree.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.637
It is unanimous.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.033
You sent for me, my lord.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.256
Do not tire him.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.277
Earl Godwin.

10:14.238 --> 10:18.159
You have always been a faithful advisor.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.244
And you a generous king.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.456
And a friend.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.542
And I am grateful for your service.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.838
But I have known from the beginning

10:32.840 --> 10:35.176
who it was you were really serving.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.017
It was why I offered you Gytha
in marriage.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.647
Bringing you into my family.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.692
Making it yours

10:52.985 --> 10:57.573
and making it possible that one day,

10:58.407 --> 11:02.453
your children might rule England.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.050
If that was your plan, Your Highness,

11:17.343 --> 11:18.886
then it was a masterful one.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.641
But that day,

11:25.267 --> 11:26.769
if it is to come,

11:27.937 --> 11:30.106
is many years away.

11:30.189 --> 11:35.861
And if you have any hope
of ever seeing it,

11:39.407 --> 11:44.120
you must support Emma now.

11:47.832 --> 11:52.545
Your family depends on it.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.049
Do you understand?

12:01.220 --> 12:02.388
I do, my lord.

12:11.647 --> 12:14.233
Goodbye, Your Highness.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.091
You must call for Edward.

12:41.218 --> 12:44.722
Why? He has made his decision.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.682
With all due respect, my lady,

12:47.850 --> 12:50.811
his love for you blinds him
from the reality of the situation.

12:51.979 --> 12:55.649
When he is gone, the Earls regardless
of their oaths will turn against you

12:55.733 --> 12:57.985
and England will be thrust into Civil War.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.571
Your brother will use that
as justification for an attack,

13:00.654 --> 13:02.531
as will Norway, as will Denmark,

13:03.324 --> 13:09.330
and everything that your husband
has created will be destroyed.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.668
Edward would have
the support of the nobles

13:14.752 --> 13:17.463
and I can make certain
they would support your regency.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.883
Do you not agree?

13:22.718 --> 13:23.552
I do.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.933
But it's not necessary to send for Edward.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.354
I already have.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.536
King Svein.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.664
We found him, Your Highness.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.998
His camp is not far.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.416
And what of support?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.709
He is alone.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.546
Block his escape.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.349
I want him dead.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.749
Magnus Olafsson.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.920
I know of your plan to take
the Throne of Norway from me.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.800
You have broken the oath
between King Forkbeard and your father,

14:44.884 --> 14:47.678
and therefore, face the penalty of death.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.597
I was there, Svein.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.975
Forkbeard made my father
greet me in shame.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.103
Like this, nakedness covered only by rags.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.396
It was an oath.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.939
It was a mockery.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.905
While you received the benefit
of my father's guidance,

15:05.988 --> 15:09.366
I was shuttled from court to court
in Denmark and England.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.118
I was no one's child.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.374
That gave me time to think and plan.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.500
Plan for what?

15:20.336 --> 15:23.839
To meet with the Jarls
and steal my throne?

15:23.923 --> 15:26.926
I didn't come up here
to meet with the Jarls, Svein.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.469
I came up here to kill you.

15:31.847 --> 15:32.848
What are you doing?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.143
I am the King!

15:37.144 --> 15:40.898
You were the old King. I am the new one.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.455
In case you're worried about your mother
or your pretty wife, don't be.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.917
I will take care of them
when I return to Kattegat.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.228
My lord. We have a problem.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.525
Prince Harald is back
and on his way to Kattegat.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.115
What brought you back to Norway?

16:32.032 --> 16:33.659
I came to find a boat.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.246
I want to search for a land I once saw
when I was a child.

16:37.871 --> 16:43.002
When I was in Kattegat,
I met Canute and he gifted me a ship.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.170
Canute was in Kattegat?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.715
He's dying.

16:48.465 --> 16:52.011
Brought his sons there to determine
who would succeed him as King of England.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.346
And who did he choose?

16:55.639 --> 16:56.557
None of them.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.144
He chose Queen Emma.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.658
I'm surprised Kaysan did not choose
to come to Norway with you.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.119
He didn't have a choice.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.705
Kaysan is dead.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.332
As are Dorn and Batu.

17:24.918 --> 17:25.753
How?

17:27.546 --> 17:28.839
Does it matter?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.091
Yes, it does.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.678
I sense a hardening in you, my friend.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.685
I no longer recognize
the Harald Sigurdsson I used to know.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.271
It's because he no longer exists.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.858
You were right in Constantinople.

17:49.234 --> 17:54.531
I lost sight of my destiny
but I won't lose sight of it again.

17:55.949 --> 17:59.870
The Harald Sigurdsson you knew is dead.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.001
- My horse.
- Yes.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.824
Dear God,

18:38.283 --> 18:39.535
it cannot be so.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.957
Tell me. What news?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.042
It's not good for you, I'm afraid.

18:49.670 --> 18:53.924
There's a new King of Norway,
which means that your son is dead.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.342
Go, all of you.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.765
Take him.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.237
The King's guards serve the King.

19:19.533 --> 19:23.245
I have been Queen
of this country for seven years.

19:24.788 --> 19:29.918
You will find taking this throne
far easier than keeping it.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.628
I certainly hope not.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.924
Taking this throne has required
much more patience than I'm used to.

19:41.221 --> 19:46.226
The time will come
when a true Viking will meet you,

19:47.144 --> 19:48.520
and you will learn

19:48.604 --> 19:54.610
just how brutal
this land you desire really is.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.835
Please. Spare me.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.506
I'm afraid I can't do that.

20:17.841 --> 20:21.511
The child that you carry is a threat
to a long and happy rule.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.848
I must deal with all threats,

20:24.932 --> 20:27.559
no matter how large or small.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.355
I know something! Someone you want.

20:33.815 --> 20:34.858
Freydis.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.796
Harald!

22:05.782 --> 22:09.202
Wife. It is time that we talk again.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.879
I forgive you for freeing Freydis.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.596
I do not forgive you for locking her up.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.558
And I do not forgive you
for taking my grandson.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.061
Come now, you know I would never hurt him.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.730
He is on an adventure with the Kalaallit.

22:37.397 --> 22:40.984
Stígr and Freydis have probably
caught up with them by now.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.945
And Lang?

22:44.696 --> 22:47.324
I know you sent him to hunt them down.

22:48.784 --> 22:54.539
What he does to Stígr I cannot control
but he will not hurt Freydis.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.543
I know he won't
because she is not looking for Harald.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.381
I told you I freed my daughter.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.259
I did not tell you where she went.

23:18.146 --> 23:22.400
Katla, you summoned me? Has Leif returned?

23:22.484 --> 23:23.735
No.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.658
What is wrong? Where's Aelfgifu?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.828
I'm sorry, Freydis.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.379
Katla, get behind me.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.630
I can't.

23:43.713 --> 23:47.551
If you have any hope
for your child, do as I say.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.261
Get behind me now!

24:58.914 --> 25:00.081
Rest, my love.

25:05.378 --> 25:07.088
Go to Winchester.

25:10.800 --> 25:15.347
You must be close
to the treasury to maintain power.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.265
I'm not leaving your side.

25:19.434 --> 25:22.479
When have I ever been able
to tell you what to do?

25:25.690 --> 25:27.651
You know when I fell in love with you?

25:31.821 --> 25:33.281
On the bridge.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.618
Do you remember?

25:40.789 --> 25:43.541
You were trying to stay out of sight.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.962
Counselling Edmund.

25:47.921 --> 25:53.593
But when he ordered the archer to kill me…

25:54.803 --> 25:56.888
- I stopped him.
- Yes.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.767
You have brought me…

26:04.062 --> 26:07.565
much joy, Emma of Normandy.

26:11.319 --> 26:13.071
And you me,

26:16.241 --> 26:19.244
my Emperor of the Great Northern Empire.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.622
Hmm.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.150
I'm not ready for you to leave.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.575
Stay with me longer.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.078
Please.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.528
King Sweyn is dead.

27:35.612 --> 27:39.115
King Forkbeard swore an oath

27:39.199 --> 27:40.950
that on his death,

27:41.034 --> 27:43.203
I would be named King of Norway.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.956
And now, all that remains
is a vote by you.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.626
An excellent idea, nephew.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.088
But first,

27:53.963 --> 27:58.259
I must remind the Jarls of a promise
they made long before yours

27:59.135 --> 28:02.639
to crown me as King
upon your father's death.

28:03.598 --> 28:06.601
We did not know you had returned,
Prince Harald.

28:08.478 --> 28:09.604
You do now.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.734
Prince Harald speaks the truth.

28:16.820 --> 28:21.908
He is the rightful King of Norway.

28:23.201 --> 28:27.580
Unfortunately, the Pope will not accept
a king with Pagan sympathies.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.958
What are you talking about?

28:30.041 --> 28:32.001
Pagan sympathies?

28:37.048 --> 28:38.466
What is she doing here?

28:38.967 --> 28:40.093
A witch!

28:41.052 --> 28:42.387
I thought she was dead.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.849
- Hey, it's the witch!
- Freydis.

28:57.652 --> 28:58.903
Freydis.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.576
So, tell us, Freydis.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.746
Are you a Christian?

29:08.955 --> 29:10.373
You know the answer to that.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.083
I will take that as a "no".

29:14.002 --> 29:18.798
And are you the one the heathens call
the Last Daughter of Uppsala?

29:20.592 --> 29:24.679
The Keeper of the Faith,
the leader of the Pagans.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.100
I am.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.854
And do you have a child
with Harald Sigurdsson?

29:38.485 --> 29:39.486
I do.

29:40.904 --> 29:43.615
A son. His name is Harald.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.867
A Pagan son!

29:51.080 --> 29:54.584
If you vote for Harald Sigurdsson,

29:54.667 --> 29:57.337
you are inviting the anger
of the Holy Father,

29:57.420 --> 29:59.756
and he will punish you for this decision.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.052
- It's Magnus!
- Harald.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.054
I support Magnus.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.515
- Gather around, people.
- Magnus, yeah.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.935
Vestian, who do you support?

30:12.018 --> 30:13.978
Sigurdsson!
He's the King of Norway.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.898
Harald has the right to a claim.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.526
I support Harald!

30:20.068 --> 30:21.277
And you?

30:22.487 --> 30:23.488
So…

30:26.491 --> 30:28.243
We have reached a decision.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.789
It is decided that you, Harald Sigurdsson,

30:33.373 --> 30:35.875
are entitled the Throne of Norway.

30:37.001 --> 30:41.881
But that you, Magnus Olafsson,
also have a claim.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.259
It is our decision, therefore,

30:44.342 --> 30:47.595
that you will rule together.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.396
What say you both?

30:58.273 --> 30:59.399
I understand.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.611
And I accept your decision.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.119
I too accept your decision.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.538
But on one condition.

31:13.621 --> 31:17.834
That tomorrow, when my father's shrine
is to be consecrated,

31:17.917 --> 31:23.089
Harald promises to all that Norway
will never go back to its old ways,

31:24.924 --> 31:28.469
and agrees to burn the Pagan witch.

31:35.810 --> 31:39.522
Harald Sigurdsson. What say you?

31:46.404 --> 31:49.073
I say burn her.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.828
Yeah, burn her!

31:53.912 --> 31:55.204
Yeah!

31:55.914 --> 31:56.873
Witch!

31:57.999 --> 31:59.000
Burn, Pagan!

32:00.960 --> 32:02.045
Move!

32:02.754 --> 32:03.671
Get the fire!

32:04.213 --> 32:05.214
Burn her!

32:08.843 --> 32:11.220
- Burn her!
- Burn the witch!

32:26.110 --> 32:28.488
Do not come near me, Christian.

32:28.571 --> 32:32.158
Or I swear on my gods
I will kill you with my bare hands.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.119
That sounds like something you might do.

32:37.914 --> 32:38.957
Leif.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.215
I went to Jomsborg looking for you.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.221
I thought you were dead.

32:56.599 --> 32:58.059
Then you saw what Magnus did.

33:00.103 --> 33:04.482
Yes. And your son, is he here?

33:05.316 --> 33:08.027
No. He's in Greenland.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.655
You went home?

33:10.738 --> 33:11.823
Not to stay.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.618
We were journeying west
to find a new home.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.620
The one you used to tell me about.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.665
- The Golden Land.
- Yes…

33:23.501 --> 33:25.878
but Father stole my ships

33:25.962 --> 33:28.631
and killed our captain
to force us to stay.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.050
And took Harald away.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.094
I managed to escape…

33:35.638 --> 33:39.017
…and came here to find a new captain
to go back for them.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.728
Well, you did.

33:45.898 --> 33:48.151
And if we are to find you a new home,

33:50.403 --> 33:53.531
you must listen carefully
to what I tell you.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.044
You could not free her?

34:06.669 --> 34:10.798
The only chance of saving her is tomorrow
when they plan to burn her.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.302
For that, I will need your help.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.263
Please. I cannot help you.

34:17.346 --> 34:18.765
Yes, you can.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.893
And, yes, you will.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.856
I need as much oil like this
as you can find me.

34:28.107 --> 34:28.941
Why?

34:32.612 --> 34:34.739
To do something
I swore I'd never do again.

34:35.448 --> 34:37.950


35:53.568 --> 35:54.735
My lady?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.565
Harald Sigurdsson.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.363
Magnus Olafsson.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.117
In the name of the Holy Trinity,

37:25.201 --> 37:27.370
you must promise three things
to our people.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.914
To preserve peace among Christians,

37:29.997 --> 37:33.793
forbid robbery and unrighteous things,
and command justice.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.962
Do you commit to this promise?

37:36.045 --> 37:37.213
I do.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.173
I do.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.259
King Harald!

37:42.510 --> 37:43.928
King Magnus!

37:50.601 --> 37:52.687
And in keeping with our oath,

37:53.896 --> 37:56.857
it is now time
that we right a great wrong.

37:57.858 --> 37:59.777
- Witch!
- That's a heathen!

38:02.280 --> 38:05.366
Send her to Hell!
Send that witch to Hell!

38:09.412 --> 38:10.705
Burn her!

38:20.506 --> 38:22.008
The pagan must die.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.136
Burn her!

38:29.098 --> 38:30.474
Kill the witch!

38:46.574 --> 38:47.992
Freydis Eriksdotter,

38:48.075 --> 38:51.454
you have admitted to the murder
of the beatified Olaf Haraldsson.

38:55.374 --> 38:59.503
I have done nothing
but defend the old beliefs.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.090
Beliefs you all once held sacred.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.216
Heresy!

39:04.300 --> 39:08.512
I demand to fight my accusers and let
the gods decide who should live and die.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.432
Only the one true God can
determine guilt or innocence.

39:11.515 --> 39:15.811
No. Our Viking gods control our fate.

39:15.895 --> 39:20.441
We are not moved by your pleas
to myths and false idols.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.860
Begin this.

39:25.237 --> 39:27.907
I call the gods to this meeting!

39:35.581 --> 39:36.832
All-powerful gods.

39:41.003 --> 39:42.380
Hear me now.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.425
Rise up and protect us from this heresy!

39:48.761 --> 39:51.889
She's a witch!

39:51.972 --> 39:56.894
Strike down your anger
and redden these walls with blood!

39:57.770 --> 40:00.856
The gods returned!

40:02.942 --> 40:07.947
This world will fall sooner
than our old gods yield!

40:08.030 --> 40:10.449
She has called the gods back to Kattegat.

40:14.995 --> 40:18.707
Magnus, the gods have come for you!

40:21.544 --> 40:23.421
They're going to kill us all!

40:26.465 --> 40:27.967
Do not fear the witch!

40:28.551 --> 40:31.804
It is a trick. She commands no power here.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.535
What's wrong, Magnus?

40:55.953 --> 40:56.996
You look troubled.

41:00.207 --> 41:03.544
What are you waiting for? Light it!

41:17.391 --> 41:18.392
- Magnus!
- No!

41:18.476 --> 41:21.479
What? What is this?

42:01.519 --> 42:04.813
In tribute to you.
Thank you, Your Highness.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.534
Edward. Agnarr.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.787
The Earls must be informed
that Edward is home.

42:20.412 --> 42:21.789
A Witan must be called.

42:51.527 --> 42:54.947
Queen Emma,
it is so nice to see you again.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.324
What is this?

42:58.492 --> 42:59.451
Where's Edward?

42:59.535 --> 43:02.121
In Normandy. I assume.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.957
I'm afraid he didn't get your message.

43:06.083 --> 43:09.378
Come, Your Highness. There's much to do
to prepare for the Witan.

43:09.461 --> 43:10.754
And for your coronation.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.645
- My lady.
- Your Highness.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.065
My lady.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.084
It's a good thing
that you're here, my prince.

43:49.168 --> 43:51.337
England is in need of stability.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.006
And a strong hand.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.092
Is that not so, my lady?

43:57.176 --> 43:58.177
It is.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.850
A strong hand. Yes.

44:21.992 --> 44:25.037
Earl Godwin, I would like to speak
with my stepson alone.

44:28.290 --> 44:30.125
I'm afraid that now is not the time.

44:32.544 --> 44:33.629
I disagree.

44:35.798 --> 44:37.216
Now's the perfect time.

44:41.095 --> 44:44.139
There is still far too much to plan.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.897
Then go and plan, Godwin.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.693
I need to meet with the Queen.

45:18.173 --> 45:19.091
Look!

45:22.261 --> 45:23.429
Harald.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.764
Harald!

45:30.811 --> 45:32.771
Stígr, wake up!

45:32.855 --> 45:34.106
It is Harald.

46:04.511 --> 46:05.846
Why did you do that?

46:05.929 --> 46:07.890
What? Save your life?

46:08.974 --> 46:11.018
Keep me from killing Magnus!

46:11.685 --> 46:13.145
Because I could not allow it.

46:16.106 --> 46:18.525
Could not? Because you must be king?

46:18.609 --> 46:20.110
Because I am the King!

46:21.904 --> 46:25.782
You cannot co-rule
with the killer of my people!

46:25.866 --> 46:28.035
- He must die now!
- I know you want vengeance.

46:28.118 --> 46:29.745
This is not about vengeance!

46:29.828 --> 46:30.871
It's about justice!

46:30.954 --> 46:33.081
And I made an oath that I must honor.

46:33.165 --> 46:34.291
I see.

46:34.374 --> 46:36.502
- An oath to them.
- No, to me!

46:36.585 --> 46:37.836
To myself!

46:38.712 --> 46:40.964
Not to lose something
that is important to me.

46:44.468 --> 46:48.305
Well at least you finally
got what you always wanted.

46:48.931 --> 46:49.848
Your destiny.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.518
I hope it was worth it.

47:11.411 --> 47:15.958
I could ask you the same question,
Keeper of the Faith.

47:28.387 --> 47:29.638
It is hard.

47:31.598 --> 47:33.100
Then we've reached the same place.

47:34.893 --> 47:36.728
But like the first time we met,

47:37.604 --> 47:39.606
you've stumbled
onto something bigger here.

47:55.455 --> 47:58.125
You will be escorted out of Kattegat
by some of my ships.

47:58.750 --> 48:00.794
Escorted? No.
My work here is not finished.

48:00.877 --> 48:02.129
Yes, it is.

48:03.005 --> 48:04.798
You're a force of nature, Freydis.

48:04.881 --> 48:07.759
But Magnus is my problem, not yours.

48:08.677 --> 48:09.678
Trust me.

48:21.898 --> 48:23.483
I've loaded your boat with supplies.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.195
My men can escort you
to Iceland if necessary.

48:28.488 --> 48:29.406
It won't be.

48:32.701 --> 48:33.869
Leif the Lucky.

48:34.870 --> 48:36.371
May you find another miracle.

48:37.497 --> 48:38.957
Be well, my friend.

48:59.811 --> 49:03.148
Tell me about our son. Harald.

49:07.277 --> 49:10.489
He's brave. And strong.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.951
And he cares about people.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.665
When they see him smile,
they feel like anything is possible.

49:20.957 --> 49:22.334
Like his father.

49:26.713 --> 49:28.757
What have you told him about me?

49:30.592 --> 49:32.094
That you are a good man.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.723
Fair. Just.

49:39.017 --> 49:40.977
And that, one time,

49:41.645 --> 49:42.729
long ago,

49:44.815 --> 49:46.024
I loved you.

49:50.696 --> 49:52.614
I'm no longer that man, Freydis.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.034
I've learned the hard way.

49:56.118 --> 49:58.328
I cannot make everything right
with my words.

50:01.039 --> 50:03.166
And I've lost that smile you remember.

50:08.296 --> 50:10.257
I know where your smile is, Harald.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.844
Because I get to see it every day.

50:15.762 --> 50:18.140
If you ever want to find it again,

50:20.600 --> 50:22.978
all you have to do is meet our son.

50:26.481 --> 50:27.774
Someday.

50:29.484 --> 50:30.861
Don't wait too long.

51:21.077 --> 51:22.204
Ship the oars!

51:26.500 --> 51:30.420
The Pope will not think kindly of the King
who freed the saint killer.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.297
Then I suggest we don't tell him.

51:32.380 --> 51:34.925
The Jarls and I have been talking
about the best way

51:35.008 --> 51:36.968
to honor this agreement
we have made, Uncle.

51:37.052 --> 51:39.763
Don't worry.
I've already come to a decision.

51:45.185 --> 51:46.353
Chain him up.

51:47.562 --> 51:49.022
Throw him in a cell.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.691
It's the only kingdom you're worthy of.

51:52.234 --> 51:53.610
You cannot do this!

51:55.570 --> 51:56.947
I am a king!

51:57.030 --> 51:59.825
No! Jarls!

52:00.492 --> 52:01.493
Stop him!

52:02.953 --> 52:04.663
This is an outrage!

52:05.330 --> 52:07.123
This is my ruling!

52:08.124 --> 52:09.668
The first of many.

52:11.253 --> 52:13.713
And if any of you have a problem with it,

52:13.797 --> 52:16.091
then you are more
than welcome to join him.

52:19.177 --> 52:24.683
From this day forward, I will make
this kingdom the most powerful on Earth.

52:25.725 --> 52:29.396
And I dare any Viking to challenge me.

52:37.696 --> 52:41.199
For I am the King of Norway.

52:45.287 --> 52:49.207
I am Harald Hardrada!

52:50.792 --> 52:54.296
Hardrada! Hardrada!

52:55.088 --> 52:57.507
Hardrada! Hardrada!
