01:32.179 --> 01:33.615
[woman] This way.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.098
[Ubbe] Floki.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.579
Ketill Flatnose!

01:41.623 --> 01:44.016
By all the gods,
I never thought
I would see you again.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.583
[Ketill] And yet,
here I am, Ubbe!

01:45.627 --> 01:46.976
Very far from invisible!

01:48.456 --> 01:49.979
I thought you were Floki.

01:50.849 --> 01:51.981
Do I look like Floki?

01:54.418 --> 01:55.593
You are in Floki's boat.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.858
You went with Floki
to found a new settlement.

01:59.902 --> 02:02.034
Tell me, was it a success?

02:02.513 --> 02:03.601
[sighs]

02:04.733 --> 02:07.083
In the early days, Ubbe,

02:07.127 --> 02:10.173
it was a great struggle
for all of us.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.871
We lost many good people
to disease and starvation.

02:14.221 --> 02:17.528
Sometimes I wondered
if the gods were against us,

02:17.572 --> 02:20.096
and if our tiny colony
in Iceland
could ever succeed.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.142
Iceland?

02:22.185 --> 02:24.318
That's what we call it,
because, in winter,

02:24.361 --> 02:26.711
the fjords
fill with ice floes.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.107
But, otherwise,
the weather is fine.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
And, since then,
we have made progress.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.198
We have harvested
our first crops.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.939
Other settlers
have come to join us,

02:36.982 --> 02:38.723
and I feel optimistic
that we shall succeed,

02:38.767 --> 02:39.681
like Floki wanted.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.076
I am here to see Bjorn.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.339
My brother is now the King.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.340
Ah, so I have heard.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.778
I will go and
pay my respects.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.128
I would like to
talk about this further.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.695
Would you meet me later
in the Great Hall?

02:53.738 --> 02:54.652

03:10.973 --> 03:12.061

03:12.104 --> 03:13.236
[Bjorn] I need
your advice, Ubbe.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.066
You know what has
happened to King Harald.

03:19.721 --> 03:20.852
Should I rescue him or not?

03:21.636 --> 03:22.811
It's your decision.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.336
But you spoke about
making Kattegat great

03:26.380 --> 03:28.164
through trade, not conquest.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.774
Why would
your first decision be

03:29.818 --> 03:30.993
to go on a foreign
adventure?

03:35.693 --> 03:37.217
But King Harald
saved my life.

03:39.306 --> 03:43.005
He fought with us
to regain Kattegat.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.181
What kind of king
would turn a blind eye
to such obligation?

03:48.097 --> 03:49.011
It just makes me glad
I'm not King.

03:49.490 --> 03:50.186
[scoffs]

03:51.056 --> 03:52.101
What do you say, Hvitserk?

03:54.843 --> 03:56.236
I don't say anything.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.716
Well, you have to
have an opinion.

03:59.021 --> 03:59.804
Why?

04:00.979 --> 04:02.198
Because it would help me.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.592
It would help all of us

04:04.635 --> 04:05.767
if we knew where Ivar was.

04:07.812 --> 04:11.207
Who cares about Harald,
or Olaf, or any of them?

04:13.340 --> 04:15.124
Only Ivar matters.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.692
Just to you, brother.

04:30.574 --> 04:31.923
I don't know, Bjorn.

04:32.968 --> 04:33.838
I don't know.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.798
[shouting and cheering]

04:46.416 --> 04:48.244
I see I must make up
my own mind.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.292
[grunting]

04:58.472 --> 04:59.516
There he is!

05:01.518 --> 05:04.652
What brings you
back to Kattegat,
Ketill Flatnose?

05:04.695 --> 05:06.828
I am trying to
recruit new settlers.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.133
I don't care who they are,

05:08.177 --> 05:09.918
as long as they are
prepared to work hard.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.834
[grunting]

05:15.184 --> 05:18.709
And what of Floki?
How is he?

05:18.753 --> 05:20.885
Why has he not returned?
I would have liked
to have seen him again.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.192
The truth is, Ubbe,

05:23.888 --> 05:25.673
Floki seemed to grow tired

05:25.716 --> 05:27.327
being the leader
of a settlement
that was not working.

05:28.545 --> 05:31.766
He was disappointed,
grew despondent.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.768
Then one day,
without explanation,

05:33.811 --> 05:35.900
he just left us
and walked away.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.947
And you haven't
seen him since?

05:39.556 --> 05:41.123
No.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.559
We searched the island
for him.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.300
We spent a long time
looking for him.

05:45.170 --> 05:45.954
We found no sign of him.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.309
[grunting]

05:54.354 --> 05:55.442
There is one more thing.

05:57.139 --> 06:00.403
I once heard a story
about a wanderer
who sailed west,

06:00.447 --> 06:02.405
probably to the west
of your Iceland.

06:04.102 --> 06:07.628
It is said that he sighted
a beautiful, uninhabited land,

06:09.630 --> 06:12.241
but was driven past it
by a storm
and could not find it.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.417
Have you heard
this story before?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.637
I have heard this story
many times,

06:16.680 --> 06:18.987
and I know the wanderer
that you speak of.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.293
He lives in Iceland.
His name is Othere.

06:23.121 --> 06:26.255
I need to find that land!

06:26.298 --> 06:28.431
I am fitting out two boats
to search for it.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.607
Then you must come
to Iceland with me
and meet Othere.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.655
And to look for Floki!

06:34.698 --> 06:35.786

[instrumental music playing]

07:04.467 --> 07:06.338
What do you think of these
Eastern puppets?

07:07.775 --> 07:09.994
Hmm. I like them.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.911
I wish someone could
hold me up like that.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.436
I thought the gods did that.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.395
[chuckles]

07:22.224 --> 07:23.355
[puppet master
speaking Russian]

07:23.399 --> 07:24.748
Through the shadows
and the light,

07:25.923 --> 07:27.969
he can see she is there,

07:29.797 --> 07:30.798
but not alone.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.802
It is his wife.

07:38.675 --> 07:39.415
Beautiful,

07:41.373 --> 07:42.462
faithless.

07:43.767 --> 07:47.467
Rage, sorrow and loss
fills his heart.

07:49.294 --> 07:53.429
The rumors
and the whispers were true.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.172
He kills her lover.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.522
Then,

08:00.392 --> 08:01.916
in his anguish,
he strikes her.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.048
Again.

08:04.701 --> 08:05.441
And again.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.488
She does not cry out.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.620
She falls to the ground.

08:10.664 --> 08:11.839
Lifeless,

08:11.882 --> 08:13.318
unmoving.

08:14.189 --> 08:16.060
Yet, it is not his wife,

08:16.104 --> 08:18.933
but the King who is wounded.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.325
Forever suspicious.

08:20.369 --> 08:23.764
His trust broken.

08:23.807 --> 08:26.070
His soul cheated.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.943
His cup full of bitterness.

08:29.683 --> 08:30.510
Betrayed.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.337
Alone.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.515
Did he deserve this-

08:36.603 --> 08:37.517
this great,

08:38.082 --> 08:39.562
loving King?

08:48.266 --> 08:49.790
[instrumental music

08:49.833 --> 08:51.356
[Oleg] I have to go
to Novgorod.

08:53.097 --> 08:53.881
Novgorod?

08:55.143 --> 08:56.492
The old capital of Rus.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.016
My brother lives there.

08:59.060 --> 08:59.974
I need to talk to him.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.718
I told you,
I have family business.

09:04.761 --> 09:08.417
Then I can concentrate
on building a fleet
and raising an army.

09:10.724 --> 09:14.249
You will meet
my ward, Prince Igor.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.512
The son of my dead
brother-in-law, King Rorik.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.996
Igor is the true heir
to the kingdom.

09:42.364 --> 09:43.278

09:44.932 --> 09:45.889
Yes, Gunnhild?

09:46.847 --> 09:49.763
I have seen you
looking at Bjorn.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.461
You know, the way that women
sometimes look at men.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.595
I don't know what you mean.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.688
You are not a child, Ingrid.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.298
If you feel
what I think you feel,

10:03.341 --> 10:05.517
then I am sorry for you.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.041
But I cannot stop you
feeling it.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.309
Go on.

Where is my brother?

12:16.387 --> 12:17.824
[courtier speaking Russian]

12:17.867 --> 12:19.782
His Highness will be here
very shortly, Prince Oleg.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.653
He begs your forgiveness
for his late arrival.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.220
Give me a drink.

12:25.527 --> 12:28.660
So, I have been
curious to know.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.663
Why are you called
the Prophet?

12:33.491 --> 12:34.623
It came about like this.

12:37.017 --> 12:41.238
I attacked Constantinople,
defeated its defenders,
and subdued it.

12:41.282 --> 12:45.286
Afterwards, I was invited
to dine with its rulers
to make peace,

12:45.329 --> 12:48.855
since I was not strong enough
to occupy the city
indefinitely.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.902
But just before the feast,
I had a dream.

12:52.946 --> 12:56.253
I dreamed that my wine
was poisoned.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.607
So, I refused to drink it.

13:07.221 --> 13:11.703
But two of my commanders,
ignoring my warning, did drink,

13:13.880 --> 13:16.404
and died in
the greatest agony
soon afterwards.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.974
From that moment,
I was called...

13:22.802 --> 13:23.715
The Prophet.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.765
[indistinct chatter]

13:30.244 --> 13:31.811
Askold!

13:32.768 --> 13:33.725
Brother.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.210
[speaking Russian]

13:40.254 --> 13:41.385
Your Highness.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.738
Permit me to introduce
Ivar the Boneless.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.610
He's a Viking.

13:48.653 --> 13:49.654
[Oleg speaking Russian]

13:49.698 --> 13:51.265
Perhaps we should
speak in Norse.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.224
This is Prince Igor.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.357
Ah. Prince.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.753
I hear you are
the famous
Ivar the Boneless.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.627
Scourge of all Christians!

14:05.670 --> 14:10.806
Leader of the great army
that ravaged England
and killed two Christian Kings.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.634
[Ivar] That is true.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.679
But what is fame,
Prince Askold?

14:15.767 --> 14:18.335
A chimera?
An illusion perhaps?

14:18.379 --> 14:18.901
[Askold chuckles]

14:27.954 --> 14:30.739
[Askold] Is it true,
as I have been told,

14:30.782 --> 14:32.567
that you plan to invade
Scandinavia?

14:33.220 --> 14:34.351
[Oleg] Of course.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.485
I have been considering it
for some time.

14:38.442 --> 14:41.184
I took King Ivar's arrival

14:41.228 --> 14:43.883
as a sign that I was meant
to proceed with my plans.

14:46.494 --> 14:50.237
After all, we will
only take back
what is rightly ours.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.896
Don't you agree, brother?

15:01.857 --> 15:04.816
I will contribute
whatever I can
to your army.

15:04.860 --> 15:08.429
I hope you recognize that,
as your brother,

15:08.472 --> 15:10.561
I stand ready and waiting
for your commands.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.912
And that, in all things,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.001
you can trust me.

15:15.871 --> 15:19.048
Of course, my dear brother.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.226
More wine!

15:25.837 --> 15:27.056
To conquest!

15:30.886 --> 15:31.974

16:26.376 --> 16:27.377
help me!

16:28.161 --> 16:29.423
Help!

16:29.466 --> 16:30.990
[Askold gasps]

16:37.735 --> 16:39.215
I've been poisoned!

16:40.956 --> 16:42.566
[music continues playing]

16:46.570 --> 16:47.397
Oleg!

17:04.632 --> 17:05.894
[flute music stops]

17:07.765 --> 17:08.897
[panting]

17:17.993 --> 17:18.907
Whoo!

17:21.736 --> 17:22.911
It's been a long day!

17:26.741 --> 17:28.482
We must rest.

17:32.703 --> 17:33.704
Your Highness.

17:51.548 --> 17:52.723
[birds chirping]

17:53.202 --> 17:55.509
[horse whinnies]

17:56.771 --> 17:57.989
[birds chirping]

17:58.686 --> 17:59.991
[Oleg laughing]

18:23.232 --> 18:25.365
[Bjorn] Should I rescue
King Harald or not?

18:25.408 --> 18:28.629
[Seer] That is your affair,
Bjorn Ironside.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.718
Don't you know your own mind?

18:30.761 --> 18:31.806
I want to know
the consequences.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.462
You can see.
You know the future.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.900
[Seer] I know what I know.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.076
And what you cannot
bear to know.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.905
This is a big decision.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.082
I have only been King
a short while.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.434
If I make the wrong choice...

18:53.044 --> 18:55.264
[Seer] You think
of yourself only.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.354
The living are all the same.

19:00.226 --> 19:04.708
From either your shadow
at morning sliding behind you,

19:04.752 --> 19:08.930
or your shadow at evening
rising to meet you,

19:08.973 --> 19:12.760
I will show you fear
in a handful of dust.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.111
I'm sorry.
I should not have asked.

19:18.374 --> 19:21.029
[Seer] I will say only this,

19:21.072 --> 19:23.553
that whatever else you do,

19:23.597 --> 19:26.034
whatever you decide,

19:26.077 --> 19:29.342
do not betray
your own gods
in the process.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.040
I don't understand.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.999
Why would I betray
my own gods?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.658
-[chickens clucking]
-Don't let them run off.

19:41.702 --> 19:42.529
[man shouting]

19:45.662 --> 19:47.882
[man] Need some more tiles
for the roof here.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.929
[indistinct chatter]

19:51.973 --> 19:52.756
[goats bleating]

19:54.280 --> 19:56.586
[Hali] Look, Asa, it's Ubbe!

19:56.630 --> 19:57.805
And look what he's brought!

19:59.937 --> 20:01.678
[Ubbe]
There they are! Hello!

20:03.550 --> 20:06.248
Did you see
the fat little piggy?
Go see him! Hmm?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.209
[Lagertha]
How was your visit
to Kattegat?

20:11.819 --> 20:13.081
Do they still remember me?

20:14.256 --> 20:15.431
What do you think?

20:16.867 --> 20:17.912
I saw Bjorn and Hvitserk.

20:18.652 --> 20:19.348
Bjorn is good.

20:20.393 --> 20:21.394
Hvitserk looked sick.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.353
He is still haunted
by the thoughts of Ivar.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.532
Sometimes
I think of Ivar, too.

20:29.576 --> 20:33.275
I know that he is still
somehow part of all our fates

20:33.319 --> 20:35.799
but, we just
have to accept it,

20:35.843 --> 20:37.148
and get on with our lives.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.722
I saw Ketill Flatnose.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.856
-Ketill Flatnose?
-Mmm.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.510
What was he doing?

20:50.553 --> 20:53.817
Trying to recruit more people
for the settlement in Iceland.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.254
That's what they're calling
their new land.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.910
What of Floki?
Was Floki with him?

21:00.346 --> 21:02.086
No.

21:02.130 --> 21:06.395
He said that Floki
became disenchanted
with their new life

21:06.439 --> 21:08.310
and that he just disappeared
without warning.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.274
I wonder
what has become of him.

21:21.367 --> 21:25.414
Floki can't be dead.
I won't believe it.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.462
Ketill also told me

21:29.940 --> 21:31.290
that the wanderer

21:31.333 --> 21:33.292
who saw the uninhabited
land further to the west,

21:35.119 --> 21:36.991
his name is Othere,

21:37.034 --> 21:39.210
and he lives in Iceland.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.690
I told him that we would
sail back with him,

21:40.734 --> 21:42.344
so I can meet
with this Othere.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.693
-That's good news!
-Hmm.

21:43.737 --> 21:44.303
Yes.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.177
Thank you
for your gifts, Ubbe.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.701
Now we have to decide
which animal to sacrifice,

21:51.745 --> 21:53.312
so the gods can bless
this new dwelling.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.141
I will invite
the local villagers
to join us

21:57.185 --> 21:58.839
and we will feast.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.755
Hali! [clapping]

22:03.800 --> 22:04.888
Bring the chickens!

22:06.890 --> 22:08.849
[bell dinging]

22:10.851 --> 22:13.070
Ivar. Get up.

22:14.637 --> 22:15.464
We have to leave.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.426
I was dreaming

22:22.036 --> 22:23.820
that my wine was poisoned,

22:23.864 --> 22:25.866
and that's the reason
why I didn't drink it.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.610
Why did you have to
kill your brother?

22:35.266 --> 22:37.051
Because this child
belongs to me.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.315
Not to Askold,
not to anyone else.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.362
His father made me
his guardian.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.321
What did Askold do?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.409
I heard reports.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.019
Askold was
grooming the child.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.501
He was trying to
steal him away from me.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.418
And that I could not allow.

22:57.332 --> 22:58.507
He's just a child.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.381
No.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.472
He's not just a child.

23:07.951 --> 23:10.389
He is the only
legitimate heir.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.043
To control him is
to possess the only keys
to the kingdom.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.526
And I mean to keep
those keys safe
about me.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.180
Mmm.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.403
Igor, wake up.

23:25.055 --> 23:25.926
[speaking Russian]

23:25.969 --> 23:27.449
What is it?

23:27.493 --> 23:28.189
-[in English] Wake up.
-[Igor speaking Russian]

23:28.232 --> 23:29.712
What is it, you devil!

23:29.756 --> 23:31.061
Don't play games with me.

23:32.889 --> 23:33.716
It's time to go.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.416
[horn tooting]

23:41.071 --> 23:42.769
What is happening?

23:42.812 --> 23:44.248
Seems like we have visitors.

23:45.249 --> 23:46.076
[speaking Russian]

23:46.120 --> 23:46.947
Prince!

23:48.252 --> 23:49.732
Prince,

23:49.776 --> 23:51.560
your brother Dir
is approaching.

23:54.781 --> 23:57.000
Oleg, what is happening?
Hmm?

23:58.349 --> 24:00.047
I forgot to tell you.

24:01.222 --> 24:02.310
I have another brother.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.444
It seems like
he wants to talk to us.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.934
[horse whinnying distantly]

24:22.069 --> 24:23.679
[horse whinnying]

24:25.768 --> 24:26.552
[grunts]

24:31.208 --> 24:32.601
You don't have to
be afraid.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.484
[birds chirping]

25:09.638 --> 25:11.205
[door closing]

25:17.124 --> 25:17.994
[speaking Russian]

25:18.038 --> 25:19.082
Where's the boy?

25:19.126 --> 25:20.431
He is safe and well.

25:22.259 --> 25:22.912
Who's the cripple?

25:24.523 --> 25:25.654
You haven't heard?

25:26.916 --> 25:28.788
This is King Ivar the Boneless,

25:28.831 --> 25:29.658
the Viking.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.312
The Viking?

25:31.834 --> 25:33.401
Uh-huh.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.142
[in English]
I think we should
speak in his language.

25:38.275 --> 25:39.363
The fact is,

25:40.495 --> 25:42.323
you murdered our brother
in cold blood.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.282
And you had
no reason to do it.

25:45.326 --> 25:48.459
Mmm. I believe
I had every reason.

25:50.853 --> 25:51.811
Many reasons.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.075
Enough reasons.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.077
Oleg,

25:58.295 --> 25:59.383
you see how things are?

26:01.864 --> 26:04.824
You are in a bad situation.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.566
An impossible situation.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.570
I ought to arrest you
for murder.

26:13.659 --> 26:14.834
No one would help you.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.838
No matter how often
you wash your hands,

26:18.881 --> 26:20.448
they still have our brother's
blood on them.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.062
Of course, you can
still avoid catastrophe.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.373
Hand over the boy,

26:32.416 --> 26:35.594
and you and the cripple

26:36.420 --> 26:37.247
can leave.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.991
Otherwise, I might dispense
with the formalities

26:42.035 --> 26:45.429
and deal with you
as you dealt with
our brother.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.431
You of all people
should know better

26:47.475 --> 26:49.085
than to try to threaten
and blackmail me.

26:51.305 --> 26:54.221
I am the Prophet.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.354
And I know, that unless
you give me and King Ivar
and Prince Igor

26:57.398 --> 26:58.747
free passage back to Kiev,

27:01.010 --> 27:03.752
then something
truly terrible will
happen to you.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.366
Not in a few months. No.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.762
Not even in a few weeks. No.

27:13.806 --> 27:14.676
But in a matter of days.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.723
[chuckles nervously]

27:19.986 --> 27:20.682
Good try.

27:23.990 --> 27:27.907
You have two hours
to hand over the boy
unharmed.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.085
Otherwise, I will
proceed as I suggested...

27:33.913 --> 27:34.740
Brother.

27:43.009 --> 27:43.879
[scoffs]

27:44.924 --> 27:46.186
Is it true?

27:47.927 --> 27:49.232
What he said about you?

27:52.061 --> 27:54.803
My brother has seen
enough of my prophecies
come true to make him

27:54.847 --> 27:58.677
at least pause for thought.

28:08.077 --> 28:08.861
[sighing]

28:15.650 --> 28:16.433
[groans]

28:27.793 --> 28:29.708
[retching]

28:38.325 --> 28:39.718
[laughs]

28:41.720 --> 28:43.286
[chuckles]

29:07.833 --> 29:09.399
[strumming on lute]

29:45.435 --> 29:46.872
[footsteps approaching]

29:56.316 --> 29:57.665
Beautiful. Ivar?

30:14.464 --> 30:15.857
-It's gonna be a long day.
-Yeah.

30:15.901 --> 30:16.771
[woman] What do you have?

30:17.816 --> 30:18.860
[indistinct chatter]

30:30.089 --> 30:32.961
You are my wife's servant.
What is your name?

30:33.701 --> 30:34.789
Ingrid.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.447
In this world,
you have to be
so careful, Ingrid.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.669
[indistinct background chatter]

30:49.195 --> 30:50.326
I don't want to be careful.

30:57.725 --> 30:58.944
[sighs]

31:03.209 --> 31:05.864
[indistinct shouting]

31:06.429 --> 31:07.778
[chickens clucking]

31:07.822 --> 31:09.998
[indistinct shouting
continues]

31:13.349 --> 31:14.394
Hali!

31:16.222 --> 31:17.266
[Bjorn] Where are my children?

31:18.311 --> 31:22.358
Hali! Asa! Come here!

31:23.794 --> 31:25.927
Hello!

31:25.971 --> 31:27.886
[Bjorn]
Oh, it is good to see you.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.452
Come. Show me
what you have built!

31:29.496 --> 31:31.890
It's over here!
Hali built most of it.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.413
Did he?

31:33.456 --> 31:34.893
[Hali] You're right.

31:37.243 --> 31:42.552
Oh, it is so big!
[laughs]

31:42.596 --> 31:46.687
[Lagertha] The King
stoops to visit
a lonely old farmer!

31:46.730 --> 31:47.949
Ah, you don't look that lonely!

31:52.214 --> 31:53.172
Oh!

31:57.480 --> 31:58.917
-Ubbe.
-Bjorn.

31:59.352 --> 32:00.135
Torvi.

32:00.788 --> 32:01.702
Hello, Bjorn.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.400
The children are always
a credit to you.

32:05.532 --> 32:06.489
And Ubbe.

32:07.577 --> 32:08.274
And, of course, Ubbe.

32:09.928 --> 32:10.972
Brother.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.018
[Lagertha] Come.

32:15.585 --> 32:16.369
Come on.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.154
Oh, I like this place.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.506
You're a master builder, Hali.

32:23.550 --> 32:24.333
-I know.
-[laughs]

32:25.595 --> 32:26.945
Let's go inside.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.168
[raven crowing]

32:38.739 --> 32:39.740
[footsteps approaching]

32:48.270 --> 32:49.837
You have had two hours.

32:50.751 --> 32:51.970
What is your decision?

32:52.796 --> 32:54.059
My decision?

32:55.364 --> 32:56.626
I told you.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.280
Hand over the boy,

32:59.151 --> 33:02.197
or I kill you and the cripple.

33:02.850 --> 33:03.982
Mmm.

33:07.507 --> 33:10.162
Perhaps you have forgotten
what I said.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.729
I said, unless you release
the three of us, unharmed,

33:14.340 --> 33:16.733
then in day or so,
a terrible thing will
happen to you.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.779
I don't believe you.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.303
You don't really
have second sight.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.873
I think maybe you should
believe him.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.048
What has this
to do with you?

33:27.701 --> 33:28.745
Nothing.

33:30.617 --> 33:31.313
Everything.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.015
You are bluffing.

33:38.581 --> 33:43.021
But let me give you
the benefit of the doubt,

33:44.979 --> 33:47.895
and ask you a question
that only a true prophet
could answer.

33:49.984 --> 33:51.507
I recently got married.

33:52.900 --> 33:53.770
In secret.

33:58.688 --> 34:02.823
The identity of my wife
is only known
to a few trusted servants.

34:02.866 --> 34:06.218
Not even Askold knew
about my nuptials
and the name of my wife.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.177
But I assume

34:11.310 --> 34:12.615
that you know.

34:15.923 --> 34:17.229
Don't you, brother?

34:21.842 --> 34:23.017
Yes.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.411
I know your wife's name.

34:27.717 --> 34:28.457
I know everything.

34:54.527 --> 34:55.093
[growls]

34:57.051 --> 34:58.966
[chuckling]

35:00.185 --> 35:02.012
Believe me, Bjorn,

35:02.056 --> 35:05.015
I respect your decision
to try and settle matters
with King Harald.

35:05.755 --> 35:07.366
But you must remember,

35:07.409 --> 35:09.498
Harald betrayed
me personally.

35:10.804 --> 35:11.979
He kidnapped Astrid.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.634
He lied to me.

35:14.677 --> 35:17.506
I do not believe
that he is trustworthy.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.552
I understand.

35:19.595 --> 35:20.988
And I'm sure that
if I were you,

35:21.031 --> 35:22.816
I would not go to
his aid.

35:22.859 --> 35:23.947
I would let
King Olaf kill him,

35:23.991 --> 35:25.210
and I would not be
troubled.

35:25.949 --> 35:26.776
But I am not you.

35:28.387 --> 35:31.651
I remember I was in a room
with Ivar, at his mercy,

35:31.694 --> 35:34.958
and King Harald said,
"Stop, no, this is
not our way."

35:36.395 --> 35:38.832
And for me, since
King Harald and I
have become allies,

35:38.875 --> 35:41.530
this is not our way.
It is not my way
to abandon him.

35:41.574 --> 35:42.357
[Lagertha] I remember

35:43.445 --> 35:46.274
I refused to go raiding
with Ragnar,

35:46.318 --> 35:50.060
precisely because
I feared to leave
Kattegat undefended.

35:50.104 --> 35:53.107
Kattegat won't go undefended.
Hvitserk can look after it.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.985
What?

36:02.029 --> 36:03.552
I saw Hvitserk
when I was in town.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.208
Well, frankly, brother,
he is not fit to be

36:07.252 --> 36:09.471
left in charge of the defenses
of Kattegat.

36:09.515 --> 36:10.298
What do you mean?

36:11.169 --> 36:11.995
You know what I mean.

36:14.302 --> 36:17.175
Hvitserk is a sick man,
and he's a drunk.

36:22.528 --> 36:23.311
[Bjorn] Yes.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.487
[sighs] I can't deny it.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.970
Which means there's
only one thing.

36:30.013 --> 36:34.017
I know you and Torvi
are very anxious to embark
on your great journey.

36:34.061 --> 36:37.760
I myself remember
very well the great
sense of satisfaction,

36:37.804 --> 36:40.676
the great sense
of expectation, the great
feeling of desire to be free.

36:41.721 --> 36:42.548
To be Viking.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.291
But I would ask you
to delay your journey.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.076
Delay your journey
only for a little while,

36:49.119 --> 36:50.338
while I deal with King Olaf.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.471
Look after Kattegat.
Look after Hvitserk.

36:52.514 --> 36:53.733
And then go,
with my blessing.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.214
[sighs]

37:01.915 --> 37:02.916
[grunting in agreement]

37:05.875 --> 37:07.225
We agree.

37:08.443 --> 37:09.227
Thank you.

37:11.577 --> 37:12.665
Thank you.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.023
[Dir] What are you
waiting for?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.029
Tell me her name.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.166
[Dir chuckles]

37:38.256 --> 37:39.126
You see?

37:40.519 --> 37:42.172
He doesn't know her name.

37:43.435 --> 37:44.697
He's bluffing after all!

37:46.264 --> 37:48.048
[scoffs] I knew it.

37:49.441 --> 37:50.703
You don't know her name.

37:50.746 --> 37:51.051
[Oleg] Anna.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.054
Her name is Anna.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.451
You were married at
the Church of
St. Magnus Martyr

37:59.494 --> 38:00.278
here in Novgorod.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.543
I believe this is
the lady in question.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.514
[laughing]

38:22.038 --> 38:22.822
Am I right?

38:23.997 --> 38:26.739
This is your new bride,
Anna. [laughs]

38:28.610 --> 38:32.135
Now, my dearest brother,

38:32.179 --> 38:35.748
you will give
the three of us
free passage out of here

38:37.097 --> 38:38.707
or my promise
will come true.

38:45.018 --> 38:48.021
Order the warriors
to stand down.

38:48.064 --> 38:51.459
Prince Oleg and his party
should be untroubled
when they leave,

38:52.852 --> 38:54.767
if they agree
not to harm my wife.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.813
I don't need
to harm your wife.

38:57.857 --> 38:59.902
Anna, come. Come!

39:04.298 --> 39:06.082
[Oleg sighs]

39:06.126 --> 39:07.606
[Oleg]
We meet so rarely, Dir.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.175
It's unfortunate
that it has to be
in such circumstances.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.483
But the next time,

39:16.397 --> 39:17.616
will be different.

39:19.226 --> 39:20.096
You have the boy.

39:21.446 --> 39:22.664
You don't need to
see me again.

39:23.143 --> 39:24.362
But we are family.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.538
Family is important!

39:30.977 --> 39:32.195
[Oleg] Dir!

39:33.283 --> 39:34.284
We should stay in touch.

39:37.462 --> 39:38.550
Perhaps.

39:40.247 --> 39:41.727
Just don't invite me
for dinner.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.037
You forgot to
say goodbye
to the cripple!

39:48.081 --> 39:49.343
[door closes]

39:54.261 --> 39:55.871
[woman] Sister, come
see the stitch work.

39:57.090 --> 39:57.873
You see here?

40:08.754 --> 40:10.016
I have made up my mind.

40:16.588 --> 40:18.546
I have decided to answer
King Harald's cry for help.

40:25.292 --> 40:26.554
I think you're crazy.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.649
I'm sure that doesn't
matter to you.

40:48.402 --> 40:50.360
[drizzling]

41:15.647 --> 41:17.649
[indistinct chatter]

41:18.388 --> 41:19.868
[chickens clucking]

41:23.872 --> 41:25.395
King Bjorn.

41:25.439 --> 41:26.745
I wanted to catch you
before you left.

41:28.747 --> 41:30.400
You told Ubbe
and the others that Floki

41:30.444 --> 41:32.533
just abandoned
the Iceland settlement.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.536
Yes. He was unhappy
with many things.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.278
And simply disappeared.

41:41.716 --> 41:42.891
And you searched for him?

41:45.764 --> 41:48.506
You never found a body?

41:51.160 --> 41:52.161
[Bjorn] Huh.

41:55.556 --> 41:56.644
What do you suppose
happened to him?

41:59.604 --> 42:00.474
I don't know.

42:02.694 --> 42:03.738
How should I know?

42:06.088 --> 42:08.351
I have a feeling you know
a lot more than you admit.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.182
So, here's what I suggest.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.055
I am raising an army.

42:17.099 --> 42:18.840
Join me.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.712
Forget about your
settlement in Iceland
for a while

42:20.755 --> 42:21.582
and come with me.

42:23.236 --> 42:24.585
Of course, you are
always free to say no

42:24.629 --> 42:25.499
and go on your own way.

42:27.762 --> 42:29.416
[whispering] But that
would make me
even more suspicious.

42:32.593 --> 42:33.376
No.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.206
I will go with you,
Bjorn Ironside.

42:38.643 --> 42:40.775
-[hits table]
-Good choice.

42:46.041 --> 42:48.043
[music playing]
