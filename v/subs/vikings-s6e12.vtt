00:01.335 --> 00:03.037
[Ragnar]
Previously on Vikings...

00:03.071 --> 00:04.004
The great hero is dead.

00:04.038 --> 00:05.773
Kattegat is at our mercy.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.141
I won't really be King.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.442
[Ivar] Oleg will have
all of the power.

00:08.476 --> 00:09.943
How can we change it?

00:09.977 --> 00:12.280
We will make common cause
with our friend Dir.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.816
I wish with all my heart
I could go back
and start again.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.351
Accept the judgement
of the gods.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.786
The situation is bad.

00:18.819 --> 00:19.853
[Erik] They are here.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.155
Why don't you just surrender?

00:21.189 --> 00:22.723
Is that how
our world will end?

00:22.756 --> 00:24.492
You are dying, my love.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.827
I need you to help me
put my armor on, one last time.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.363
It's impossible.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.065
I told you, Ivar,
you can't kill him.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.604
[all shouting]

00:38.506 --> 00:39.573
[shouts in native tongue]

00:41.775 --> 00:42.843
[groans]

00:45.779 --> 00:47.781
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

-[indistinct chatter]
-[bell tolling]

01:42.670 --> 01:44.172
[horse whinnying]

01:46.140 --> 01:47.308
[horse snorting]

02:01.722 --> 02:02.823
[grunts]

02:10.431 --> 02:11.432
[women wailing]

02:37.725 --> 02:38.826
[in native tongue]

02:43.130 --> 02:44.332
[indistinct chatter]

03:01.081 --> 03:03.784
Ivar! Where are you?

03:03.817 --> 03:06.654
Igor? Don't worry, I'm here!

03:06.687 --> 03:07.721
[Ivar grunts]

03:33.781 --> 03:35.082
[sword clatters]

03:35.115 --> 03:36.517
[Oleg] We were defeated.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.488
It's not possible.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.756
We were defeated
by a dead man.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.059
I don't understand.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.596
The great Bjorn Ironside.

03:48.629 --> 03:54.268
He was dead, but appeared
in front of his army

03:54.302 --> 03:56.236
like the resurrected Christ.

03:58.606 --> 04:03.076
Our soldiers panicked.
They ran away.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.381
But it was the officers
who were the worst cowards.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.619
-But if he was dead--
-It doesn't matter.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.788
They must be punished.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.624
Those responsible.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.162
It's not possible
for us to be defeated.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.233
It won't happen again.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.636
It will never happen again!

04:32.506 --> 04:33.741
[birds squawking]

04:38.746 --> 04:40.414
[man shouts]

04:47.421 --> 04:48.456
[man 1] It's a small boat.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.957
[man 2] Who is it?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.625
[man 1] I'm not sure.
Maybe from Kattegat.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.926
[man 2] It's not one
of our ships, is it?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.328
[chatter continues
indistinctly]

05:05.373 --> 05:07.408
[man sighs in relief]

05:07.441 --> 05:09.643
[Ketill]
You're the first settlers
this season. Congratulations.

05:09.677 --> 05:14.047
I bring a message for Ubbe,
son of Ragnar, if he's here.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.352
Here I am.

05:20.354 --> 05:24.425
[panting] Your brother,
Bjorn Ironside,

05:24.458 --> 05:25.959
King of Kattegat...

05:28.662 --> 05:29.963
is dead.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.650
[footsteps approaching]

05:49.683 --> 05:50.684
[door opens]

05:54.321 --> 05:55.523
What do you want?

05:58.526 --> 06:01.361
Go away!
I command you to go away!

06:03.597 --> 06:04.598
No!

06:05.566 --> 06:07.234
[soldiers grunting]

06:07.267 --> 06:08.268
[objects clattering]

06:09.403 --> 06:10.404
No!

06:12.372 --> 06:13.373
No!

06:14.508 --> 06:16.143
No!

06:16.176 --> 06:17.177
[objects clattering]

06:33.393 --> 06:34.528
[grunting continues]

06:43.637 --> 06:45.072
-Stop!
-[wood creaks]

06:52.079 --> 06:53.080
[sobs]

06:54.648 --> 06:56.283
[soldiers breathing heavily]

07:02.322 --> 07:03.390
Come down here.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.060
I said come down!

07:18.806 --> 07:19.940
What have I done?

07:24.244 --> 07:25.613
I don't know.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.549
I have destroyed
your innocence.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.417
It's time you grew up, Igor.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.219
You're not a child anymore.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.922
Your age of innocence
is over! Gone!

07:34.955 --> 07:37.157
I will no longer
protect or shield you

07:37.190 --> 07:39.126
from the harsh realities
of life.

07:39.159 --> 07:42.496
From now on,
I'll make you face them.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.870
For how else are you
ever going to be King?

07:55.609 --> 07:56.544
[grunts]

08:05.385 --> 08:07.020
[Ubbe] Tell me
how my brother died.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.358
Kattegat was attacked
by the Rus.

08:12.826 --> 08:17.665
A great army,
led by King Oleg of Kiev.

08:19.166 --> 08:23.470
There were two battles,
the first near Vestvold.

08:23.503 --> 08:28.676
In that battle, the Rus,
they overcame us.

08:28.709 --> 08:34.848
King Harald fell,
and Bjorn was badly,
almost mortally, wounded.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.950
We retreated back to Kattegat.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.953
The Rus, they gathered outside.

08:39.987 --> 08:43.490
That night,
Bjorn breathed his last.

08:46.493 --> 08:50.530
In the morning,
a great miracle happened.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.402
He rode out
in front of our warriors.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.338
And, the Rus,
having heard of his demise,

08:58.371 --> 09:02.542
were shocked
and terrified to see him
actually alive again.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.312
Believing him to be a ghost,

09:05.345 --> 09:09.249
those superstitious creatures,
they fled before him
and they never returned.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.052
[indistinct murmuring]

09:13.053 --> 09:14.988
[chuckles softly]

09:15.022 --> 09:16.289
I don't know what to say.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.759
[Ubbe] I do.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.864
Here in this faraway place,

09:23.897 --> 09:28.201
I want to pay tribute
and salute the life
of my brother Bjorn.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.606
Many a time
on the battlefield

09:32.640 --> 09:37.745
I looked to him
for leadership and courage,
and he never failed.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.180
I loved him.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.149
We all loved him.
He was our hero.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.621
I know that he wanted us
to go on this
incredible journey

09:47.655 --> 09:50.123
and to find a new land.

09:50.157 --> 09:54.094
Just like our father,
he wanted to throw off
the shackles of old...

09:55.495 --> 09:58.131
whatever the risk.

09:58.165 --> 10:04.237
He is now in Valhalla
with Ragnar, so there's
no need to be sad.

10:04.271 --> 10:08.876
Fill up your horns,
and let's drink
to the great Bjorn Ironside!

10:08.909 --> 10:11.945
He was my brother,
and he was your brother.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.414
Bjorn.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.590
-Bjorn.
-[all] Bjorn Ironside!

10:29.196 --> 10:30.363
[drumming]

10:33.266 --> 10:34.768
[indistinct chatter]

10:35.869 --> 10:37.004
[laughter]

10:39.006 --> 10:41.008
[all cheer]

10:59.960 --> 11:01.194
[chatter recedes]

11:02.796 --> 11:04.231
[drumming stops]

11:14.174 --> 11:15.909
[Erik] I don't
mean to disturb you.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.981
All these objects were alive
when Bjorn was alive.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.450
They lived in his presence.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.153
But now
they are all cold and dead.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.391
Let me give you
his sacred ring.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.329
He would have wanted that.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.365
Thank you.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.334
I will keep it warm.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.308
Bjorn's death has left
a hole in all our lives.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.444
But it has also left
a vacancy in Kattegat.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.816
The King is dead.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.586
Kattegat has no ruler
and yet Kattegat remains
in the gravest threat

11:59.619 --> 12:01.054
of another Rus attack.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.392
The people
must elect a new ruler.

12:08.762 --> 12:13.466
Ubbe would be
the natural successor
to Bjorn, but he is not here.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.873
But you...

12:21.741 --> 12:23.844
...are Bjorn's wife,

12:23.877 --> 12:26.679
and a great shield maiden.

12:26.713 --> 12:30.717
Proved yourself
again and again in battle.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.553
You gave him good advice,
you are clever,

12:33.586 --> 12:35.422
and you are beautiful,
Gunnhild.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.927
[Erik sighs]

12:39.960 --> 12:42.595
I think you should
summon an Althing,

12:43.931 --> 12:46.499
and I will propose
you as Queen.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.104
I do not think
I am so popular.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.473
Not with the people.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.775
You are popular
with those who saw you fight.

12:55.809 --> 12:59.947
And you are Bjorn's wife.
You are popular by association.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.151
I have no desire to be Queen.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.288
[sighs] I know.

13:08.321 --> 13:12.459
But you know
perfectly well you cannot
decide your own fate...

13:13.426 --> 13:15.195
for it is already written.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.665
[man yells indistinctly]

13:29.843 --> 13:32.880
It seems that there is
a vacancy in Kattegat

13:33.713 --> 13:34.848
for a King.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.952
Hmm.

13:38.986 --> 13:42.289
Why don't you
sail back with your wife
and two children

13:42.322 --> 13:43.857
and claim the throne?

13:43.891 --> 13:45.358
I mean, who will stop you?

13:47.160 --> 13:50.463
And I will remain here
in Iceland as King.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.802
[Ketill stutters] Doesn't that
make sense to you?

13:55.835 --> 14:00.340
Never look a gift horse
in the mouth,
that's what I say.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.079
I will never be King...

14:08.148 --> 14:09.549
not of anywhere.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.720
I am a lot like my father.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.656
He never wanted
to be King of Kattegat.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.691
He hated
the burden of kingship.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.532
And he despised those
who would be anything...

14:25.565 --> 14:29.536
betray any principle or person,
just to seize the crown.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.607
I hope you're not
like that, Ketill.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.550
[panting]

14:54.627 --> 14:56.129
[indistinct arguing
in distance]

15:14.948 --> 15:18.418
-[Ragnar crying]
-[Torvi shushing]

15:19.987 --> 15:22.755
How is my son?

15:22.789 --> 15:27.027
Ragnar is strong. Healthy.
He will be fit to travel.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.361
[Ragnar cooing]

15:28.395 --> 15:29.429
Good.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.100
The two ships
are almost seaworthy.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.468
I cannot wait to go.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.737
-[giggles]
-[Ragnar coos]

15:37.770 --> 15:39.306
I saw Ketill
and Othere today.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.274
They were talking.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.443
So?

15:44.144 --> 15:45.312
Then they argued.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.548
What about?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.750
I couldn't hear them.
The point is--

15:50.783 --> 15:52.585
I know
what the point is, Torvi.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.689
We have to sail with them.

16:02.595 --> 16:03.863
I will talk to them.

16:19.312 --> 16:23.183
Ancient One.
I should have known.

16:23.216 --> 16:28.288
[Seer] What is real now
will not be real tomorrow.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.024
Don't listen to
all the voices!

16:31.058 --> 16:33.460
There are too many voices!

16:35.462 --> 16:36.696
Don't listen.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.648
[horses whinnying]

17:07.660 --> 17:09.662
[men grunting]

17:14.734 --> 17:15.935
[grunting continues]

17:23.443 --> 17:24.577
[horses whinnying]

17:27.280 --> 17:28.948
[horses galloping
in distance]

17:53.140 --> 17:55.175
[Igor] Who are these men?

17:55.208 --> 17:59.078
They are the most
important officers in our army.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.713
Why are they digging a ditch?

18:02.415 --> 18:05.252
They need to be reminded

18:05.285 --> 18:06.753
that they're not as important

18:06.786 --> 18:08.788
as they imagine
themselves to be.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.593
They need to be reminded
to be humble.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.806
[soldier] Line up! In a line!

18:26.839 --> 18:29.409
Line up! Front!

18:38.585 --> 18:40.187
I don't want to watch.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.091
You will do as I tell you.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.661
These officers
betrayed their country.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.998
They ran from the battlefield
like cowards.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.435
I must make
an example of them.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.105
They don't deserve
to be spared.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.011
Proceed!

19:05.044 --> 19:07.013
[grunts]

19:07.046 --> 19:08.481
[all clamoring]

19:13.820 --> 19:15.322
[men groaning and screaming]

19:29.736 --> 19:30.737
[grunts]

19:51.658 --> 19:53.226
Stop!

19:53.260 --> 19:55.428
Please. Please. Please. Please.

19:57.664 --> 20:01.234
Please. Please.
Please. Please.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.239
[Oleg] One day
this will be your kingdom.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.012
Show them
what you will do to traitors.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.621
Please, please.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.356
Look up.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.760
Prince Igor,
I beg you for mercy!

20:27.794 --> 20:30.397
In the...
In the name of our Holy Mother!

20:30.430 --> 20:32.932
My wife and children...

20:32.965 --> 20:35.034
I do not deserve to die!

20:35.067 --> 20:38.104
Please! Please, don't kill me.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.939
Please!

20:41.374 --> 20:43.242
Don't kill me, please.

20:46.879 --> 20:47.914
Please.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.218
Please.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.886
[grunts]

21:15.908 --> 21:16.943
Good.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.512
Gentlemen.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.826
[soldier] Form up!

21:38.197 --> 21:39.198
Turn!

21:40.967 --> 21:42.001
Forward!

21:49.609 --> 21:51.611
[indistinct chatter]

21:59.819 --> 22:05.425
Gunnhild,
have you made a decision?

22:05.458 --> 22:08.428
I have decided to call
a meeting of the Althing.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.697
Kattegat must have
a new ruler.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.699
Bjorn knew that.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.801
And you
will stand for election?

22:14.834 --> 22:16.168
It depends.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.470
On what?

22:17.504 --> 22:19.872
If anyone will stand
against me.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.307
Have you heard any rumors?

22:22.141 --> 22:23.443
No.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.844
And what about Ingrid?

22:24.877 --> 22:25.912
I have no idea.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.280
And you will support me?

22:28.314 --> 22:29.315
Of course.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.218
You are ambitious.

22:32.251 --> 22:34.821
What would you expect
in return for your support?

22:37.189 --> 22:41.227
Some token of friendship.

22:43.229 --> 22:46.399
You know how much I admire you.

22:46.433 --> 22:50.036
I cannot believe that Bjorn
would take another wife
when he already had you.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.472
-Hush.
-That's what you said before,
at Bjorn's wedding,

22:52.505 --> 22:54.841
but I do not
want to be silenced.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.645
I want to be honest.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.013
Honest about
my desire for you.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.286
-[indistinct chatter]
-[horses snort and whinny]

23:13.125 --> 23:16.362
[Hvitserk] I have to go.
I have an appointment
with Prince Oleg.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.564
What for?

23:17.597 --> 23:19.031
I don't know. He invited me.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.737
Why would
he want to do that?

23:24.771 --> 23:26.272
That's what
I intend to find out.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.444
Well, be careful, my brother.

23:31.478 --> 23:34.080
The Rus are not like us. Hmm?

23:34.113 --> 23:35.214
Hmm.

23:43.289 --> 23:47.794
Come on, Igor. Tell me,
what do you want to do, huh?

23:47.827 --> 23:50.362
-Kill myself.
-[laughs]

23:50.396 --> 23:51.931
It's too early for that.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.034
[beggar] A moment
of your time, sirs.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.103
Go away, you filthy peasant.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.471
I have a story to tell.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.439
I told you to go away!

24:00.473 --> 24:01.908
Listen to my story.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.745
I want to listen.

24:11.818 --> 24:12.919
[indistinct chatter continues]

24:24.931 --> 24:26.398
Prince Dir.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.400
[Dir] I have good news.

24:28.434 --> 24:30.903
I came to tell you
that I'm almost ready
to challenge Prince Oleg.

24:30.937 --> 24:36.308
Many of the returning warriors
have become disillusioned
with my brother's leadership.

24:36.342 --> 24:38.945
They have lost faith in him.
They are ready for a change.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.280
My army will assemble
at Novgorod.

24:41.313 --> 24:47.019
When we have captured
the garrison, I expect you
and Prince Igor to join me.

24:47.053 --> 24:52.592
You will receive a dagger.
That will be the signal
for you to flee from Kiev.

24:52.625 --> 24:56.929
Why can't we go with you?
I hate Oleg. I think
he wants to kill me.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.431
We will not give him
any excuse to do so.

24:59.465 --> 25:03.836
I entrust you, Ivar
the Boneless, to safely convey
the Prince to Novgorod.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.873
It will not be easy.
Oleg is afraid now.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.174
He will become desperate.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.509
He will redouble
the guard on the Prince,

25:10.543 --> 25:14.313
for if he loses Prince Igor,
he loses any claim
to be the legitimate ruler.

25:15.815 --> 25:16.883
I understand.

25:18.417 --> 25:22.121
You are the rightful King
of this great land.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.690
I will see you crowned.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.358
Thank you, Prince Dir.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.327
I love you.

25:44.577 --> 25:48.014
[Oleg] Hvitserk.
Son of Ragnar.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.721
We were thrust
upon each other.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.256
I didn't know
anything about you.

25:57.289 --> 26:00.793
Your brother Ivar
was rather mysterious
about your relationship.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.462
Oh, please, sit.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.898
Be comfortable.

26:09.301 --> 26:14.040
I know
that brotherly relationships
can often be strained.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.475
Difficult. [chuckles]

26:18.745 --> 26:20.980
It's been so
with my own brothers.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.755
Why did you
want to talk to me?

26:30.957 --> 26:33.125
-I like Vikings.
-Mmm-hmm.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.594
I would like to have
a bodyguard of Vikings.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.197
I would trust you
more than my own guards.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.265
[Oleg sighs]

26:40.332 --> 26:42.134
Except, perhaps, for Ivar.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.738
Even though
I love Ivar. [chuckles]

26:52.278 --> 26:53.646
[exhales]

26:53.680 --> 26:55.247
I was disappointed,
of course,

26:55.281 --> 26:58.550
that we failed
to capture Kattegat.

26:58.584 --> 27:02.121
But I'm no longer interested
in attacking Scandinavia

27:02.154 --> 27:03.856
and its peasants.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.561
I believe we should
attack Constantinople.

27:09.595 --> 27:13.165
A richer and much more
attractive target.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.634
Hmm?

27:23.175 --> 27:24.877
You don't say anything.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.947
Sometimes silence is better.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.453
Along the Silk Roads,

27:34.486 --> 27:37.957
the Chinese and Arabs
have given us many things.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.692
Beautiful things.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.660
Splendid things.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.395
Pleasurable things.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.331
Like this.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.666
[sizzling]

27:49.035 --> 27:50.169
[Hvitserk] Uh...

27:51.570 --> 27:53.372
What is it?

27:53.405 --> 27:55.374
It's just poppy seed.

27:55.407 --> 27:56.909
You just smell it.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.846
[Oleg] It makes you happy.

27:59.879 --> 28:02.314
-I, uh--
-Oh, it's just one small sin.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.316
Are you so afraid?

28:12.024 --> 28:13.860
[inhales deeply]

28:15.928 --> 28:17.229
Smell it.

28:19.565 --> 28:20.767
[inhales]

28:30.877 --> 28:33.279
-[breathing heavily]
-[horse grunting]

28:39.185 --> 28:40.286
Whoa.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.831
Is this really the land
that you want to
be King of, Ketill?

28:51.864 --> 28:58.437
[grunts] This harsh, stony,
unproductive land
that is miserable?

28:58.470 --> 29:01.740
You will struggle
the rest of your life
just to survive here.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.810
Think about what
I'm offering you instead.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.780
I have no idea
who you are,

29:07.814 --> 29:09.782
where you came from,

29:09.816 --> 29:11.918
what you believe in,
or even what your
real name is.

29:11.951 --> 29:15.021
Perhaps that is how
it is meant to be.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.989
But I do know we need
to trust each other.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.559
We need you
to come with us,

29:20.592 --> 29:22.761
to help us to furnish
a second boat.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.296
Without you, we can't leave.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.267
Why would you hesitate?

29:28.300 --> 29:32.371
Because it all depends
if Othere is telling the truth.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.041
[Ubbe] We cannot trust Ketill.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.076
But without him, the others,
they would not come.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.413
But I know
that Ketill went mad,

29:41.447 --> 29:44.616
slaughtered an innocent
family without warning.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.954
And in which case,
that could easily
happen again.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.655
If we are at sea
on an open boat,

29:49.688 --> 29:52.258
the... The consequences,
they would be catastrophic.

29:54.693 --> 29:59.765
Unless you and I are willing
to deal with it together.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.000
[Ubbe] His story changes
so often,

30:01.033 --> 30:02.801
it is hard to know
what to believe.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.571
-And yet you want to believe.
-I want to believe.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.373
I need to believe.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.779
If you want to stay here
in this stony wilderness,
then tell me now.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.284
What do you say,
the man called "Othere"?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.289
I say you have a deal.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.197
I need someone I can trust
on this voyage.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.205
You can trust me
well enough.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.925
I don't mean to disturb you.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.694
It's all right.

31:05.664 --> 31:08.500
It is hard to accept
that Bjorn is gone.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.402
Yes.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.872
But at least I have this.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.212
You are with child?
Bjorn's child?

31:21.948 --> 31:25.017
Yes. With Bjorn's child.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.792
It was terrible
when Gunnhild lost the child
she was carrying.

31:36.128 --> 31:39.999
Sadly, we cannot
wait for your child
to become ruler of Kattegat.

31:40.032 --> 31:42.434
These are quick
and desperate times.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.203
The Rus may attack us again,

31:44.236 --> 31:47.773
and yet we have
no King or Queen
to unite behind.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.178
You are Bjorn's wife.

31:52.211 --> 31:53.645
You carry his child.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.518
I think the legacy
of Ragnar Lothbrok
and Bjorn Ironside

31:59.551 --> 32:00.987
should live and continue.

32:07.493 --> 32:08.827
Then I have a chance?

32:10.262 --> 32:11.830
Given the right preparations.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.768
I would like to be Queen.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.805
I know.

32:35.421 --> 32:36.622
Poor Ivar.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.759
What do you mean?

32:40.792 --> 32:43.629
You were hoping
to return to Kattegat
as a King...

32:44.530 --> 32:45.631
weren't you?

32:47.366 --> 32:50.102
Perhaps.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.838
-You wanted to
return to the past.
-[sighs]

32:57.109 --> 32:58.644
You loved your wife.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.647
What was her name?

33:04.283 --> 33:05.551
Freydis.

33:15.127 --> 33:19.198
We are all brought back
perpetually to the past.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.868
You're wrong.

33:25.204 --> 33:29.075
What did she look like,
this Freydis?

33:30.476 --> 33:31.543
Hmm.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.848
She was small.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.250
-Like you.
-Mmm.

33:39.651 --> 33:40.819
But blonde.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.623
She dressed
after our fashion.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.159
She wore her hair... So.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.931
And I trusted her.

33:55.434 --> 33:58.270
She was the one
that told me I was a god.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.777
What do you want
me to say? Huh?

34:07.012 --> 34:08.947
Only what you want to say.

34:13.252 --> 34:18.190
I don't believe
you want to betray Oleg.

34:18.224 --> 34:20.559
You just say that.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.595
And how can I
prove it to you?

34:23.629 --> 34:25.597
Oh, I don't know.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.044
I told you. I can't.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.816
[indistinct chatter]

34:51.157 --> 34:52.791
[indistinct chatter]

34:59.064 --> 35:01.233
Is this really want
you want to do, Ketill?

35:01.267 --> 35:02.901
Of course it is.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.436
I don't understand.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.472
Your position
in Iceland is secure.

35:06.505 --> 35:09.908
We don't have to
risk everything on this voyage.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.444
On the contrary. We do.

35:12.478 --> 35:13.712
Frodi understands.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.582
I need redemption.
We both do.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.584
I cannot live
with the ghosts.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.787
We did a terrible thing.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.989
But now we can
do a good thing.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.492
The gods will understand
and not punish us.

35:26.525 --> 35:30.128
If you kept quiet,
they would not punish you.

35:30.162 --> 35:34.200
You have a big heart and
a loud voice, Ketill Flatnose.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.469
I could wish that
you were more subtle.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.706
I do lead with my heart,
I admit.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.576
But I want to be
an honest soul.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.678
Who can fault me
for that?

35:54.986 --> 35:57.389
So we commit our
bodies to the deep.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.825
Life is a journey.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.660
Like death.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.465
We are borne ceaselessly
into the future.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.666
Mmm.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.669
Some on a ship of fools.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.881
[Gunnhild] I wanted
to tell you, Ingrid,

36:22.914 --> 36:25.651
that I have summoned
a meeting of the Althing...

36:27.018 --> 36:28.754
to elect a new ruler
of Kattegat.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.091
I want to know
if you will stand.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.199
I did not think
I would stand...

36:43.201 --> 36:44.736
except for this.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.107
What is "this"?

36:52.578 --> 36:54.846
I am carrying
Bjorn's child.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.662
But, forgive me,

37:10.696 --> 37:14.232
I remember you told me
that you were raped
by King Harald.

37:14.266 --> 37:17.569
So, perhaps the child
you carry is his.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.708
I knew I was pregnant
before Harald raped me.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.412
This is Bjorn's child.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.384
That should have been
my child.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.291
[indistinct chatter]

37:54.806 --> 37:56.241
[Ivar panting]

37:57.275 --> 37:58.510
Hvitserk.

38:12.591 --> 38:13.959
Hvitserk, huh?

38:29.341 --> 38:30.542
[sniffs]

38:34.480 --> 38:36.482
-[indistinct chatter]
-[lively music playing]

38:52.364 --> 38:53.699
King Ivar.

38:53.732 --> 38:56.001
My lady Katia
would like to see you.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.203
-What, now?
-Yes.

38:59.905 --> 39:00.972
[Ivar grunts]

39:07.579 --> 39:08.580
[grunting]

39:15.821 --> 39:17.022
Are you sure?

39:37.075 --> 39:38.076
[Katia speaking
in native tongue]

39:47.018 --> 39:48.153
Huh.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.187
[in native tongue]

40:44.442 --> 40:45.511
[in English] No, no, no.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.118
[breathing heavily]

40:59.825 --> 41:01.827
[breathing heavily]

41:13.872 --> 41:15.874
[both breathing heavily]

41:24.716 --> 41:28.654
I told you so!
Do you believe me?

41:39.497 --> 41:40.899
I'm going to bed.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.003
Good night, Gunnhild.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.178
Do you want
to come with me?

42:00.318 --> 42:01.920
[breathing heavily]

42:18.003 --> 42:20.371
I know that
Dir is still alive.

42:22.107 --> 42:25.210
Please tell me,
has he been in contact
with you?

42:25.243 --> 42:28.046
And where is he?

42:29.615 --> 42:30.916
He came here.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.820
He told me that
his army is assembling

42:34.853 --> 42:37.422
and will soon
take over Novgorod.

42:38.790 --> 42:41.860
We're waiting for his signal.

42:41.893 --> 42:46.531
When the signal comes,
we must spirit Igor away.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.368
Igor is the future.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.238
I know.

42:54.305 --> 42:55.373
[shuffling]

43:03.381 --> 43:06.184
Are you not going to stay?

43:06.217 --> 43:09.888
It would be bad
if the voters saw us together.

43:11.256 --> 43:12.490
I suppose.

43:16.461 --> 43:17.663
We will talk soon.

43:18.563 --> 43:19.564
Of course.

43:21.299 --> 43:22.400
Erik.

43:25.637 --> 43:27.338
What is it you really want?

43:29.307 --> 43:30.742
I think you know.

43:42.353 --> 43:44.355
