00:47.714 --> 00:53.704
<i>Early 21st century. Robot technology
undergoes massive development.</i>

00:54.304 --> 00:57.044
<i>By mid-century,
Japan leads the world</i>

00:57.184 --> 01:00.424
<i>in robot knowledge and application.</i>

01:00.558 --> 01:03.554
<i>From domestic uses to weaponry,</i>

01:03.724 --> 01:05.848
<i>Japan dominates the world market.</i>

01:06.564 --> 01:09.644
<i>As the technology is extended
to the human body</i>

01:09.771 --> 01:11.976
<i>the mood of
the international community</i>

01:12.114 --> 01:14.480
<i>turns againtst use of humanoids.</i>

01:14.740 --> 01:18.316
<i>Just as with nuclear power
and biotechnology before,</i>

01:18.448 --> 01:22.065
<i>U.N regulations are proposed</i>

01:22.248 --> 01:24.443
<i>to limit robot technology.</i>

01:25.373 --> 01:29.414
<i>Japan fiercely
resists this limitation</i>

01:29.584 --> 01:32.450
<i>but the will of the U.N.
is unshakeable.</i>

01:33.177 --> 01:38.423
<i>Japan takes the extreme step
of withdrawing from the U.N.</i>

01:38.552 --> 01:40.754
<i>And begins a new policy
of national isolation.</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:47.555
<i>Japan uses it high technology
to withdraw from world affairs.</i>

01:47.687 --> 01:50.176
<i>10 years go by.</i>

01:50.820 --> 01:53.472
<i>The resulting information blackout</i>

01:53.607 --> 01:56.688
<i>turns Japan into a total enigma.</i>

01:59.781 --> 02:02.064
<i>For an entire decade,</i>

02:02.364 --> 02:07.072
<i>no foreigner penetrates the veil.</i>

02:43.453 --> 02:45.191
This is disrupting
my entire holiday.

02:45.827 --> 02:50.069
Now that your family has alredy
left Washington for Denver.

02:50.418 --> 02:52.157
Don't the Japanese

02:52.293 --> 02:54.540
understand it's Christmas?

02:55.004 --> 02:57.125
Dragging us miles out here...

02:58.629 --> 03:01.748
At least the British, French
and Russians are here, too.

04:47.945 --> 04:52.318
<b>"S.W.O.R.D."</b>

04:55.378 --> 04:57.487
<b>The R.A.C.E.</b>

05:01.627 --> 05:04.707
Final stand-by. We go in on my mark.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.840
Dumb gig. Dumb time of year.

05:10.679 --> 05:13.984
Just some Christmas party, right...

05:14.517 --> 05:16.092
Do the job quick

05:16.475 --> 05:18.305
and you'll home
for Mom's Turkey.

05:38.830 --> 05:43.875
Each of the wolrd's nations has
debated the issue of human evolution

05:44.464 --> 05:47.664
and come to
the exact same conclusion.

05:48.845 --> 05:51.961
Thus we can say that this result

05:52.676 --> 05:57.136
represents a true and just future
for humanity.

05:59.357 --> 06:05.017
If we at Daiwa Heavy Industries
have your endorsement,

06:05.568 --> 06:08.851
I'd appreciate a round of applause.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.488
Didn't think so...

06:44.982 --> 06:47.264
The primary target is Saito
of Daiwa Heavy Industries.

06:49.069 --> 06:51.976
We're working on a tip-off.
It might be a trap.

06:52.201 --> 06:55.529
Keep zour eyes open.

06:57.076 --> 07:01.402
I said we didn't need 'em.
Why so many robots?

07:01.664 --> 07:04.364
No idea. Ask the chief...

07:04.668 --> 07:06.910
They're the latest Daiwa models.

07:07.216 --> 07:09.200
Latest or not,

07:10.715 --> 07:12.537
I don't trust them.

09:32.651 --> 09:33.635
S.W.O.R.D.?

09:36.737 --> 09:38.020
Darn you, Maria...

10:25.283 --> 10:26.649
Get out of my way!

12:46.763 --> 12:47.879
Darn.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.184
Dispose of all the bodies.

13:17.543 --> 13:19.283
What the heck's going on?

13:19.418 --> 13:21.784
What's SWORD doing here?

13:22.171 --> 13:25.453
Answer me.
Don't you know who I am?

13:25.924 --> 13:29.289
For God's sake, I demand to know.

13:37.689 --> 13:38.546
Leon!

14:24.399 --> 14:30.351
<b>"VEXILLE"</b>

16:36.361 --> 16:39.350
<i>"SWORD HQ, Los Angeles"</i>

17:02.015 --> 17:04.835
It's a flagrant violation
of international treaties.

17:06.012 --> 17:07.794
Wich ones?

17:07.932 --> 17:10.970
They ingnored just about every one.

17:12.893 --> 17:14.887
Which part is metallic?

17:15.104 --> 17:17.597
Well, it's bio-metal.

17:18.025 --> 17:20.348
So this was his only robotic part?

17:21.992 --> 17:23.686
I hope that's the case.

17:24.032 --> 17:26.986
But during the raid
we confirmed his bio-signature.

17:27.244 --> 17:30.196
It might've been added later.

17:30.327 --> 17:32.202
Is that even possible?

17:33.209 --> 17:34.864
Not with our technology.

17:36.501 --> 17:41.161
If Japan is manufacturing
androids of this level...

17:41.298 --> 17:44.251
It would pose a threat
equal to nuclear power.

17:44.516 --> 17:48.344
This mean Saito's an android?

17:50.931 --> 17:53.387
In any case,

17:53.519 --> 17:56.178
there's nothing comparable
in the US, legit or otherwise.

17:56.690 --> 18:00.185
It'll take forever
to reverse-engineer.

18:01.068 --> 18:03.558
This reminds me of San Pedro
last month.

18:15.296 --> 18:16.368
Zak...

18:39.400 --> 18:42.599
Despite all the people
living in this city.

18:42.853 --> 18:48.984
We only talk to people with
this badge or to our darn computers.

18:49.703 --> 18:51.192
It's not the city's fault.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.991
It's the age we live in.

18:55.913 --> 18:57.239
Anything from Irene?

19:02.421 --> 19:03.913
Not a word.

19:04.589 --> 19:05.916
Sorry...

19:07.882 --> 19:12.132
Hear anything about San Pedro
from Leon?

19:15.563 --> 19:16.806
Really...

19:19.815 --> 19:22.602
Was the tip-off for this misson
from San Pedro?

19:22.734 --> 19:23.764
Correct.

19:24.276 --> 19:26.726
Not that it's a secret any more.

19:34.540 --> 19:39.019
<i>"Port of San Pedro"</i>

20:22.208 --> 20:25.284
Why the need for us to guard this?

20:25.460 --> 20:29.206
That's the latest
Japanese weapon system.

20:29.388 --> 20:32.040
But any enemy would have 'em, too.

20:32.182 --> 20:34.676
The battlefield is Japan's
showroom after all.

20:35.012 --> 20:40.049
It's not right that everyone
treats Japan special.

20:41.901 --> 20:43.842
Some day, they'll get
what they deserve.

21:27.902 --> 21:30.269
Cease pursuit and withdraw.

21:30.402 --> 21:31.977
You've got to be kidding.

21:32.697 --> 21:35.773
I repeat, caese pursuit immediately.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.187
This is our turf.

22:09.273 --> 22:10.346
Zak!

23:18.131 --> 23:19.376
Be careful.

23:21.178 --> 23:22.506
SWORD...

23:23.228 --> 23:27.299
December...23rd...Mt. Filar...

23:27.895 --> 23:30.304
Beware...of a meeting.

23:31.103 --> 23:32.553
Maria...

23:47.582 --> 23:51.825
Leon trusted
the fugitive completely.

23:54.435 --> 23:55.416
I mean,

23:55.546 --> 23:58.333
even now I can't belive
it was an android.

24:00.054 --> 24:01.337
Function-wise?

24:01.468 --> 24:04.253
You couldn't tell it wasn't human.

24:04.681 --> 24:06.130
Might it have been?

24:06.267 --> 24:09.011
There was
absolutely no bio-signature.

24:09.730 --> 24:11.301
But those eyes...

24:13.484 --> 24:14.852
Autospy results?

24:15.395 --> 24:16.891
They sent the android back to Japan

24:17.028 --> 24:19.847
after political pressure.

24:19.986 --> 24:21.226
In the end...

24:22.616 --> 24:26.105
they hardly laid a finger on it.

24:28.287 --> 24:29.700
Really...

24:35.000 --> 24:36.116
Maria...

24:36.877 --> 24:40.414
<i>Japan. Completely off our screens
for an entire decade.</i>

24:40.965 --> 24:43.967
<i>But we ignore its</i>

24:43.973 --> 24:46.337
<i>recent suspicious
activity at our peril.</i>

24:47.137 --> 24:48.802
<i>We still don't know</i>

24:48.972 --> 24:50.674
<i>the purpose of
the meeting at Mt. Filar.</i>

24:51.563 --> 24:56.515
<i>But a State Dept. Order says
the politician we detained there</i>

24:56.648 --> 24:59.563
<i>must be returned to his duties.</i>

25:00.777 --> 25:07.067
<i>There's also strong pressure
from Japan to return Saito's limb.</i>

25:10.209 --> 25:12.988
<i>As for the results of the autospy,</i>

25:13.165 --> 25:16.822
<i>it's composed of
undetecable bio-metal.</i>

25:17.332 --> 25:20.868
<i>Judging from bio-signature analysis,</i>

25:22.049 --> 25:26.461
<i>we strongly suspect Saito is
an android.</i>

25:29.220 --> 25:34.386
<i>Android production is a grave
violation of international treaties.</i>

25:37.610 --> 25:41.559
<i>Nonetheless, the White House
is urging caution.</i>

25:41.691 --> 25:44.057
<i>Any action that</i>

25:45.361 --> 25:51.489
<i>might harm good relations
with Japan, is forbidden.</i>

25:54.206 --> 25:57.954
<i>But Japan is up to something.</i>

26:00.796 --> 26:06.165
<i>Henceforth we at SWORD
will be on our own.</i>

26:06.679 --> 26:07.881
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

26:08.008 --> 26:10.465
<i>you can forget about
goverment protection.</i>

26:14.514 --> 26:19.309
<i>We are to face this threat
to international society</i>

26:19.986 --> 26:22.720
<i>and neutralize it by our own means.</i>

26:25.651 --> 26:27.434
<i>Our mission this time:</i>

26:30.033 --> 26:32.192
<i>to infiltrate Fortress Japan.</i>

26:34.078 --> 26:37.948
<i>Japan has been veiled in mystery
for 10 yers.</i>

26:38.121 --> 26:41.199
<i>The time has come to unmask it.</i>

26:51.849 --> 26:56.254
These images are of Tokyo
10 yers ago.

26:57.394 --> 27:01.514
As you know, no-one has been there
since its seclusion.

27:02.444 --> 27:04.636
Its most powerful corporation,
Daiwa Heavy Industries,

27:04.778 --> 27:07.351
has dominated the economy
for the past yers of isolation.

27:07.487 --> 27:10.648
Daiwa dictates Japan's politics
and controls all aspects of life.

27:11.617 --> 27:15.776
We also guess that it's behind
the policy of national isolation.

27:16.458 --> 27:19.696
Japan's high-tech seclusion
is made possible

27:19.829 --> 27:21.908
by an electro-magnetic network
named R.A.C.E.

27:22.791 --> 27:29.453
It relies on 270 sea-based antennas
covering the entire archipelago.

27:30.223 --> 27:35.418
As you know, it filters out
all waves and light reaching Japan

27:35.812 --> 27:38.839
and scrambles outbound signals

27:39.813 --> 27:43.346
to create a total barrie
to all transmissions

27:43.486 --> 27:46.143
rendering even satellite
surveillance worthless.

27:47.524 --> 27:51.192
Your mission is to penetrate
the electromagnetic field

27:51.371 --> 27:56.146
then transmit a reverse beacon
to unscramble the diffusion barrier.

27:56.990 --> 27:58.565
If successful,

27:58.701 --> 28:02.488
this will facilitate
direct satellite surveillance.

28:03.247 --> 28:06.503
The beacon transmission from Tokyo

28:06.632 --> 28:11.328
must last at least 3 minutes
for the satellite to align.

28:12.298 --> 28:14.669
One problem is your entry route.

28:15.046 --> 28:18.043
All waters and airspace

28:18.180 --> 28:22.093
are guarded by a warning system
on a technological par with R.A.C.E.

28:22.809 --> 28:27.143
Not even a micro-recon craft,
much less a person,

28:27.279 --> 28:28.563
can get through.

28:50.126 --> 28:54.163
After you send
the beacon transmission

28:54.423 --> 28:58.166
the infiltration team will press
further into Japan

28:58.393 --> 29:02.551
to gain as much information
as possible about Daiwa Industries.

29:02.903 --> 29:08.265
72 hours later you'll meet at a
predetermined extraction point.

29:27.582 --> 29:29.825
Commander Leon Fayden

29:30.007 --> 29:33.743
has volunteered
to lead this dangerous mission.

29:34.801 --> 29:38.176
10 years ago
he was dispatched to Japan

29:38.306 --> 29:42.301
leading an anti-terrorist task unit
helping Japanese security.

29:42.978 --> 29:45.550
They suddenly shut the borders

29:45.726 --> 29:48.801
but he was there
until forcefully repatriated.

29:59.570 --> 30:01.067
Why didn't you tell me?

30:02.577 --> 30:04.734
I didn't want you to worry.

30:04.869 --> 30:06.400
Not about volunteering...

30:06.578 --> 30:08.161
the fact that you were in Japan.

30:10.623 --> 30:12.707
I never had a chance to.

30:12.834 --> 30:14.415
Is that the only reason?

30:16.179 --> 30:17.629
Yes, it is.

30:32.986 --> 30:35.806
Didn't want you involved...

32:02.783 --> 32:04.604
Bring up the deck monitor!

32:06.664 --> 32:09.447
This vessel is not damaged
or under attack.

32:09.957 --> 32:13.241
A nearby US cargo ship
just exploded.

32:13.459 --> 32:15.113
We are investigating the cause.

32:15.289 --> 32:17.453
Just in case,
let's go to emergency status.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.300
Freight inspections all complete.

33:23.694 --> 33:25.125
Safely past border security.

33:25.325 --> 33:27.526
We'll lose radio contact shortly.

34:32.052 --> 34:36.877
3 minutes to analysis completion.

34:37.016 --> 34:38.879
Receiving beacon transmission.

34:42.898 --> 34:45.346
Please guys, just 3 minutes...

34:45.525 --> 34:50.264
Analysis is in progress...

34:52.905 --> 34:54.194
<i>1 minute passed.</i>

35:02.412 --> 35:03.991
<i>2 minutes, 30 seconds passed.</i>

35:11.130 --> 35:12.914
<i>10 seconds to completion.</i>

35:13.509 --> 35:16.676
<i>9,8,7...</i>

35:17.722 --> 35:18.803
What is it?

35:19.222 --> 35:20.801
Signal's lost, sir.

35:21.060 --> 35:23.680
-Find out why.
-Analysis not possible.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.181
Scan again.

35:32.867 --> 35:37.899
<i>System alert...</i>

35:39.166 --> 35:47.290

Vexille, this way.

36:33.422 --> 36:34.621
Zak!

37:09.545 --> 37:11.661
In an entire decade,

37:12.380 --> 37:16.456
you are our first foreign guests.

37:18.174 --> 37:20.879
We've quite a welcome for you.

37:24.896 --> 37:27.278
On my signal, rush for the water.

37:28.060 --> 37:29.509
I won't go by myself.

37:29.630 --> 37:32.725
You're the only one with a back-up
transmitter.

37:35.651 --> 37:37.058
We'll join you later.

38:44.304 --> 38:45.417
Leon...

38:58.192 --> 38:59.804
Don't worry, Miss.

39:01.325 --> 39:03.771
I'm alone. Nothing to be afraid of.

39:07.489 --> 39:10.698
Maria changed your clothes, not me.

39:11.541 --> 39:12.694
Maria?

39:17.250 --> 39:18.535
Don't go outside!

39:49.867 --> 39:50.925
Leon...

40:15.850 --> 40:18.346
Do exactly as I say.

40:27.321 --> 40:28.311
Maria...

40:31.245 --> 40:35.282
Don't you dare go out again
They're still looking for you.

40:35.456 --> 40:38.534
Sorry, Maria. It was my fault.

40:42.593 --> 40:44.831
I never thought SWORD would turn up.

40:51.221 --> 40:52.630
So much food...

40:55.772 --> 40:57.048
What about my colleagues?

40:59.352 --> 41:01.763
-Go cool this.
-Sure.

41:02.737 --> 41:04.226
What about Leon and the others?

41:07.402 --> 41:09.274
What happened to Leon Fayden?

41:11.283 --> 41:13.441
His whereabouts unknown.

41:19.541 --> 41:20.946
We're still looking.

41:39.312 --> 41:40.882
This is real.

41:41.698 --> 41:43.726
It's really rare, y'know...

42:06.339 --> 42:07.954
You slept for 2 days.

42:09.299 --> 42:10.786
Get some food in you.

42:19.184 --> 42:23.181
It was you who sent the messenger
to America?

42:32.656 --> 42:34.019
One more question.

42:35.114 --> 42:36.355
Where are we?

42:40.250 --> 42:44.285
Thie used to be known as Tokyo.

42:48.922 --> 42:50.286
Tokyo...

43:03.605 --> 43:06.726
Captain, a second transmission.

43:07.939 --> 43:08.936
Are you certain?

43:09.062 --> 43:11.515
Certain, sir.
From the back-up transmitter.

43:11.655 --> 43:13.187
It's still coming in.

43:14.946 --> 43:16.985
We're counting on you this time...

43:25.791 --> 43:28.287
Never used chopsticks before, Miss?

43:34.045 --> 43:35.127
Tasty?

43:50.564 --> 43:52.054
That's like magic.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.391
Where did you hide it?

44:05.915 --> 44:07.826
Saito's heading this way.

44:32.106 --> 44:34.471
Most impressive...

44:42.704 --> 44:48.026
On second thoughts, not.
5 guys for 1 girl?

44:48.829 --> 44:50.328
That's kinda pathetic.

44:52.916 --> 44:55.118
Where's the SWORD women?

45:02.595 --> 45:04.003
Any chick would run

45:04.181 --> 45:05.670
from a tacky tie like that.

45:06.896 --> 45:09.388
The boss goes soft on you

45:12.690 --> 45:14.223
but I don't have his problem.

45:15.896 --> 45:18.265
I don't know what you're planning

45:18.861 --> 45:22.524
but whatever you do
it's just a matter of time.

45:38.927 --> 45:40.665
I'll see you at headquarters.

45:47.224 --> 45:48.426
He's right.

45:51.434 --> 45:52.931
It's just a matter of time.

46:24.263 --> 46:26.755
Daiwa's serious about finding you.

46:34.266 --> 46:35.594
What is it?

46:38.901 --> 46:40.722
This place is so full of life.

46:48.326 --> 46:50.445
I've never seen anywhere like it.

46:54.590 --> 46:57.452
It makes me nostalgic somehow...

47:56.056 --> 47:57.176
Bad news.

48:51.158 --> 48:53.315
Come here...

48:54.784 --> 48:55.862
Get in there.

49:04.415 --> 49:06.824
<i>Analysis completion...</i>

49:06.966 --> 49:09.538
Captain, 3 minutes completed.

49:09.753 --> 49:12.249
Okay, let's run the analysis.

49:15.726 --> 49:20.587
Run the feeds from satellites
JC17 & JD15.

49:22.439 --> 49:24.618
<i>Running analysis.</i>

49:26.320 --> 49:31.433
<i>Analysis is in progress.</i>

49:45.544 --> 49:46.948
Nothing there...

49:48.464 --> 49:51.334
No mountains...no rivers...

49:53.013 --> 49:54.288
No human habitation...

49:56.135 --> 49:59.501
What's going on in Tokyo?
Get it up there.

50:10.691 --> 50:13.099
That's all that's left of Tokyo?

50:21.082 --> 50:22.983
<i>Daiwa Heavy Industries...</i>

50:23.793 --> 50:25.656
We've got

50:25.791 --> 50:28.202
Lt. Commander Vexille Serra's
bio-signature in Tokyo.

50:28.379 --> 50:30.424
Satellite JD14
is scanning for her now.

50:34.380 --> 50:35.543
Any other survivors?

50:35.676 --> 50:37.249
None confirmed.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.336
Captain, look at this.

50:39.468 --> 50:41.044
Put it up on screen.

50:41.598 --> 50:43.214
The red dor is her.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.757
She's being pursued?

50:45.140 --> 50:47.307
JD14 is tracking her.

50:47.813 --> 50:49.183
-Captain?
-What is it?

50:49.565 --> 50:54.057
The bio-signature map...
it's unfiltered, sir.

50:56.449 --> 50:59.860
Her bio-signature
is the only one down there.

51:01.538 --> 51:02.942
How can that be?

51:09.123 --> 51:10.911
They aren't human?

51:12.921 --> 51:15.206
Scan the entire country!

51:33.730 --> 51:34.848
Maria.

52:11.357 --> 52:12.556
What's this?

52:23.737 --> 52:27.196
Let's wait to see
if we're being followed.

53:03.361 --> 53:06.276
They say everything
outside the city's a wasteland.

53:06.539 --> 53:10.656
Daiwa escaped
to their island fortress.

53:11.535 --> 53:12.653
Come here.

53:13.669 --> 53:16.198
That's Daiwa out to sea.

53:23.923 --> 53:27.672
It's their fault no people are left.

53:29.182 --> 53:32.216
The Japanese race is extinct.

53:33.480 --> 53:34.682
But you guys...

53:36.147 --> 53:39.056
We're not human any more.

53:40.071 --> 53:41.680
Not human...

53:43.194 --> 53:46.518
Just fragments of humanity.

53:53.203 --> 53:54.444
Fragments?

53:55.581 --> 53:59.370
Fragments that will soon be gone.

54:01.384 --> 54:05.833
You saw it, right? The final step
between man and machine.

54:15.774 --> 54:20.597
No red blood left in our veins.

54:33.367 --> 54:36.311
You're saying none of these people
are human?

54:38.497 --> 54:39.777
But I'd never seen

54:39.912 --> 54:41.321
anywhere so alive.

54:43.788 --> 54:44.823
Trying to hold on

54:45.006 --> 54:46.680
to their humanity.

54:48.505 --> 54:51.522
Like eating food
although we don't need to.

54:57.973 --> 55:02.339
10 years ago, just before
the whole isolation policy

55:03.605 --> 55:08.556
an unknown disease spread out
from Tokyo.

55:11.442 --> 55:13.602
Infection brought a raging fever

55:14.032 --> 55:16.319
with a high mortality rate.

55:17.237 --> 55:21.526
There was no information about
cause or transmission...

55:22.247 --> 55:26.029
just a mandatory
immunization program.

55:28.824 --> 55:32.334
That was the beginning
of our tragedy.

55:36.798 --> 55:38.958
The disease
was a goverment creation.

55:39.641 --> 55:42.093
And the vaccination we all received

55:42.557 --> 55:45.883
was a Daiwa cyber-virus.

55:51.613 --> 55:54.349
It invades every cell of the body

55:54.653 --> 55:57.442
converting its molecular structure
into bio-metal

55:57.735 --> 56:01.111
so that the human body
is replaced by machine from within.

56:02.908 --> 56:08.737
What was worse, the virus
was still under development.

56:09.587 --> 56:10.781
Meaning what?

56:12.375 --> 56:15.502
We were a nation of guinea pigs.

56:16.011 --> 56:19.167
Japan was their laboratory.

56:22.469 --> 56:25.256
Finally the brain is owerwritten

56:25.813 --> 56:30.889
the person becomes an android
and falls under Daiwa's control.

56:33.526 --> 56:36.230
The speed of the process
differs between people.

56:37.068 --> 56:42.027
Some of us still cling
to our human consciousness...

56:44.661 --> 56:47.616
to the fragments of our humanity.

56:51.290 --> 56:53.119
The technology is half-baked,

56:53.842 --> 56:56.913
so most turn into junk.

56:57.781 --> 56:59.170
At best

56:59.636 --> 57:02.257
we become lumps of metal
with no memory.

57:02.681 --> 57:04.000
In either case,

57:04.640 --> 57:09.300
we're miserable specimens
awaiting death.

57:12.816 --> 57:14.306
How long do you have?

57:17.107 --> 57:19.059
Daiwa's not done.

57:19.365 --> 57:22.984
The next target is America.

57:25.951 --> 57:28.990
They've alredy planted
androids there.

57:32.329 --> 57:33.531
That politician...

57:38.129 --> 57:39.702
My buddy, Saga!

58:33.480 --> 58:34.590
Let;s go!

58:53.667 --> 58:55.193
We call those, "Jags". Failed

58:55.454 --> 58:58.279
experiments
from the android process.

58:58.924 --> 59:03.578
They search around for any kind of
metal absorb it and grow.

59:09.427 --> 59:11.467
The wasteland's crawling with them.

59:13.306 --> 59:16.383
They throw up some neat stuff
sometimes, though.

01:00:13.617 --> 01:00:14.984
We should get going.

01:00:18.665 --> 01:00:21.034
Our base is underground.

01:00:39.731 --> 01:00:42.389
Saito, what about that SWORD woman?

01:00:46.111 --> 01:00:47.560
We lost her.

01:00:48.359 --> 01:00:49.934
Failure's dogging you

01:00:50.068 --> 01:00:51.648
since you let that informant
escape to America.

01:00:53.036 --> 01:00:55.357
Maria is harboring the girl.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:02.494
Leave them alone.

01:01:04.379 --> 01:01:08.200
SWORD may have penetrated
the R.A.C.E. net.

01:01:08.587 --> 01:01:12.209
Even so, America won't do a thing.

01:01:16.052 --> 01:01:17.881
Relax, Saito.

01:01:18.431 --> 01:01:20.549
Our decade-long experiment

01:01:20.726 --> 01:01:22.222
nears fruition, at last.

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:27.722
That group, G32 Beta, in the slums

01:01:28.067 --> 01:01:30.520
they alone are perfect specimens.

01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:37.651
Maria is a part of that group.

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:40.732
Left alone they'll join us
in good time.

01:01:40.872 --> 01:01:42.034
But, sir...

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:47.241
We need not fear any act of man.

01:02:00.767 --> 01:02:04.719
Very well. Summon Itakura,
Chairman of the slum.

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:29.032
Hello.

01:02:32.923 --> 01:02:33.794
Here.

01:02:34.593 --> 01:02:36.417
A fresh piece of junk.

01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:39.250
It should contain the part you need.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:42.801
Thanks, it's just in time.

01:02:43.314 --> 01:02:44.511
Where's Maria?

01:02:47.065 --> 01:02:50.806
Everyone,
this is Vexille from SWORD.

01:03:10.547 --> 01:03:12.121
Taro, is it ready?

01:03:12.713 --> 01:03:13.991
Darn right it is.

01:03:21.345 --> 01:03:22.546
My suit...

01:03:23.139 --> 01:03:27.055
I fixed it up and
it's ready for action.

01:03:33.403 --> 01:03:34.845
Looking for this?

01:03:39.902 --> 01:03:41.917
-I sent out a beacon signal.
-For how long?

01:03:42.077 --> 01:03:43.193
Longer than 3 minutes.

01:03:43.366 --> 01:03:44.948
The R.A.C.E. net's down?

01:03:45.625 --> 01:03:48.368
Daiwa already reconfigured
the diffusion pattern.

01:03:48.536 --> 01:03:49.486
Darn.

01:03:49.877 --> 01:03:55.288
SWORD only needs
a few minutes to act.

01:03:57.092 --> 01:04:00.957
Another thing, there's one more
SWORD agent at Daiwa HQ.

01:04:01.969 --> 01:04:03.006
Leon?

01:04:03.225 --> 01:04:05.210
Yes, Leon Fayden, I believe.

01:04:10.898 --> 01:04:12.928
Where exactly is he? Any injuries?

01:04:13.062 --> 01:04:15.228
Sorry, that's all I know.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.888
Taro, what's your source?

01:04:17.047 --> 01:04:20.023
Daiwa's main stream. It's reliable.

01:04:21.153 --> 01:04:22.569
Just Leon, no-one else?

01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:39.376
No luck. No bio-sigmature
readings anywhere.

01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:44.424
I found an additional signature.

01:04:45.718 --> 01:04:47.878
There's just one other.

01:04:54.021 --> 01:04:55.050
What's wrong?

01:04:55.442 --> 01:04:57.846
The electro-magnetic diffusion
has changed.

01:04:58.238 --> 01:04:59.188
Darn.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.604
I'll re-run the analysis.

01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:14.745
Have Minerva ready to rescue them.

01:05:17.296 --> 01:05:21.246
Captain Borg, a call on the hotline.

01:05:22.633 --> 01:05:25.833
The Defense Secretary alredy?

01:05:26.843 --> 01:05:29.919
No...it's the President.

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:43.890
Borg, here.

01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:49.817
Yes, Mr. President.
That's correct.7 agents.

01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:57.284
I understand, sir.

01:06:11.099 --> 01:06:15.004
We must abort the mission.

01:06:52.303 --> 01:06:55.050
Takashi, what on earth's going on?

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.838
There's going to be an earthquake.

01:06:56.978 --> 01:06:58.052
There is?

01:06:58.224 --> 01:07:01.217
Yes, it's our last chance.

01:07:02.481 --> 01:07:04.395
We're going to smash Daiwa.

01:07:05.073 --> 01:07:06.939
Me, Maria and the guys...

01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:15.110
3 freight tunnels connect Daiwa
with the mainland.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:20.240
Only the main one links to the city.

01:07:20.413 --> 01:07:22.740
The others conect to the wasteland.

01:07:22.876 --> 01:07:24.368
They're all ceramic?

01:07:24.548 --> 01:07:29.874
Yes. A mid-size 'quake is forecast
for the next 24 hours.

01:07:30.007 --> 01:07:32.793
All communication gates are open.
In case of the quake.

01:07:34.056 --> 01:07:34.965
All communication gates are open?

01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:37.966
Correct. And we found a weak point.

01:07:39.265 --> 01:07:41.301
During the earthquake stand-by,

01:07:41.434 --> 01:07:45.683
all tunnel gates
go to auxiliary power

01:07:46.857 --> 01:07:50.396
which creates a 50% delay
between detection of an intruder

01:07:50.576 --> 01:07:54.025
and the gates sealing in response.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:57.236
How soon
do they close after detection?

01:07:57.350 --> 01:07:59.108
-18 seconds.
-How far between the gates?

01:07:59.287 --> 01:08:00.615
2,500 meters.

01:08:00.795 --> 01:08:03.241
That's pushing it
even in a fighter suit.

01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:05.412
With our air-buggies, too.

01:08:05.546 --> 01:08:07.033
But it's that or nothing.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.664
And after you break in?

01:08:13.887 --> 01:08:17.045
We drag this cable behind us.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:22.761
The Jags.

01:08:28.276 --> 01:08:30.765
They finish the job
if we get the cable inside.

01:08:31.031 --> 01:08:36.270
This is enough metal to lure them
into the heart of Daiwa.

01:08:37.116 --> 01:08:40.823
Chairman Itakura's called
an emergency council session.

01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:58.550
-Is that all?
-Yes, it is.

01:09:00.143 --> 01:09:02.296
Don't make me repeat myself.

01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:05.261
We don't wish to obstruct

01:09:05.393 --> 01:09:07.178
those who calmly
wait for the end.

01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:12.682
But surely you know Daiwa

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.897
is planning to take America next?

01:09:18.912 --> 01:09:22.696
There's so little time. Excuse me.

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:28.116
You're determined to go?

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:38.006
Suppose Daiwa responds
by opening the protective gates?

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:42.344
This is their precious laboratory.

01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:45.464
They'd never do that.

01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:55.226
In the end
we're all in the same boat...

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:58.151
trying to protect the same thing.

01:10:02.248 --> 01:10:04.321
It's just that we choose to fight...

01:10:04.454 --> 01:10:06.947
until the very moment
we become scrap metal.

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:24.675
As an outsider,
it's not my place to speak but...

01:10:26.349 --> 01:10:32.392
your city seems to celebrate
the splendor of what you've lost.

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:38.814
But Maria...

01:10:40.281 --> 01:10:42.019
she fights for

01:10:42.163 --> 01:10:44.189
the sake of what's not yet gone.

01:11:47.848 --> 01:11:49.795
Foreigners are to be expelled?

01:11:50.603 --> 01:11:52.049
What on earth for?

01:11:55.772 --> 01:11:56.927
Leon...

01:12:20.427 --> 01:12:23.171
Maria, come to America with me.

01:12:27.434 --> 01:12:28.584
What do you mean?

01:12:29.394 --> 01:12:31.550
Your departure permit is invalid.

01:12:31.682 --> 01:12:34.886
Lt. Commander L. Fayden
requested a pass for me.

01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:37.392
No such request was filed.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.011
That can't be right.
Check once more.

01:12:40.148 --> 01:12:43.770
It comes up negative.
Come with us for questioning.

01:12:44.739 --> 01:12:45.565
Get out.

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:48.396
What for? Let me call him.

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:50.443
Calls to the airport are forbidden.

01:12:54.243 --> 01:12:55.575
I'm going with you.

01:12:57.665 --> 01:12:59.449
Let me join your mission.

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:02.665
It's a Japanese domestic matter.

01:13:02.802 --> 01:13:04.752
Surely it's gone beyond that?

01:13:06.305 --> 01:13:08.710
You're a foreign guest; behave.

01:13:09.765 --> 01:13:11.592
Americans never learn...

01:13:13.267 --> 01:13:16.386
Leon chose to return here
because of you.

01:13:24.526 --> 01:13:28.192
Maria, please take me into Daiwa.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:36.069
Keep personal matters out of this.

01:13:38.996 --> 01:13:41.243
I know you want to help Leon, too.

01:13:57.187 --> 01:14:00.051
Takashi, what's wrong?

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:03.928
Takashi, hold on.

01:14:05.151 --> 01:14:06.437
Takashi!

01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:09.768
Takashi!

01:14:13.165 --> 01:14:14.481
Takashi!

01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:51.100
Takashi!

01:14:55.204 --> 01:14:56.818
Takashi!

01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:02.573
Call yourself human?

01:15:30.906 --> 01:15:33.566
This is our rule.

01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:40.947
Otherwise our plan would
be leaked to Daiwa.

01:17:06.244 --> 01:17:07.491
Vexille.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.953
We need someone to replace Takashi.

01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:31.635
Once in the tunnel, floor it
or you won't have a chance.

01:17:32.521 --> 01:17:36.186
Take a mid-line to reduce distance.

01:17:37.196 --> 01:17:40.151
Touch the brakes and it's all over.

01:17:42.664 --> 01:17:46.070
I'll lead Team Red
to the East tunnel.

01:17:46.622 --> 01:17:50.784
Saga takes Team Black to the West.

01:17:53.633 --> 01:17:56.583
We've never fielded this many units

01:17:57.343 --> 01:18:00.024
so we don't know how many Jags
will turn up.

01:18:00.597 --> 01:18:04.209
Even if you're the only one left,
don't give up.

01:18:05.307 --> 01:18:08.629
We just need one cable
to reach Daiwa.

01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:14.970
Though we are no more
than fragments...

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:17.016
we are still human.

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:24.397
As long as we have our pride
we can still take back our country!

01:19:37.526 --> 01:19:38.348
Maria,

01:19:38.528 --> 01:19:40.220
more Jags than we thought, huh?

01:19:40.986 --> 01:19:42.148
Murata.

01:19:43.029 --> 01:19:45.393
I'll double back and
get them off your tail.

01:20:07.257 --> 01:20:08.539
Team Black to Red.

01:20:08.717 --> 01:20:09.839
Red here.

01:20:15.815 --> 01:20:18.015
Almost to the target gate.

01:20:18.964 --> 01:20:20.009
Roger.

01:20:20.186 --> 01:20:21.472
They're after you!

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:38.203
Murata!

01:21:01.772 --> 01:21:03.390
We're through the gate.

01:21:22.707 --> 01:21:23.992
Leave it to me.

01:21:50.737 --> 01:21:52.227
2nd gate cleared!

01:22:32.526 --> 01:22:35.945
3rd gate cleared
but we lost Masato's team.

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:49.579
Maria, we lured them away
from the gate.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.624
Make another approach.

01:22:52.594 --> 01:22:53.662
Roger.

01:23:06.604 --> 01:23:10.521
The Jags are on the cable already.
They're too fast!

01:23:43.433 --> 01:23:44.591
Maria!

01:24:15.888 --> 01:24:16.871
Vexille.

01:25:29.785 --> 01:25:30.989
One left.

01:25:42.929 --> 01:25:43.962
Maria.

01:27:13.141 --> 01:27:14.507
How come...

01:27:24.315 --> 01:27:25.517
Bravo.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:32.613
I guess you didn't expect the tunnel
to be separated from the island?

01:27:35.911 --> 01:27:37.404
What a same.

01:27:37.955 --> 01:27:40.658
Jags can't jump that far.

01:27:44.252 --> 01:27:47.127
Chairman Itakura
kept us well-informed.

01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:50.062
Leon!

01:28:51.907 --> 01:28:54.520
Nice to see you again, Maria.

01:29:01.662 --> 01:29:04.202
We're friends from our student days.

01:29:07.713 --> 01:29:10.001
The 10 years haven't changed you.

01:29:11.048 --> 01:29:16.463
As beautiful
and as dangerous as ever.

01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:19.090
Mr. Kisaragi...

01:29:25.444 --> 01:29:28.519
<i>Nobody move. You're in breach of
international law.</i>

01:29:28.653 --> 01:29:31.060
<i>Nobody move...</i>

01:29:36.159 --> 01:29:37.358
Maria...

01:29:37.827 --> 01:29:39.691
I warned you in vain.

01:29:52.547 --> 01:29:54.291
The irony of fate.

01:29:54.844 --> 01:29:57.582
Hardly imagined I'd see you again.

01:30:00.596 --> 01:30:02.178
I can't let you do that!

01:30:19.283 --> 01:30:20.772
"Insufficent evidence"?

01:30:22.332 --> 01:30:26.783
We're public servants with no chance
against the might of Daiwa.

01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:30.619
It's not just breach of a treaty;

01:30:30.753 --> 01:30:33.167
their research
is a threat to mankind.

01:30:34.674 --> 01:30:36.456
They were released this morning.

01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:48.809
We are the peak of human evolution.

01:30:49.442 --> 01:30:50.933
In fact human existence is nothing.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.811
But a preparatory stage
in our creation.

01:30:56.489 --> 01:30:59.024
There's nothing evolved about you.

01:31:11.543 --> 01:31:15.665
This body, born of humankind
is perfection.

01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:20.165
Matchless in level of intellect
and stability of emotion.

01:31:21.225 --> 01:31:24.589
No need for sleep nor food.

01:31:25.059 --> 01:31:28.931
Above all, we shall attain
immortality at last.

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.932
What more could be asked?

01:31:37.156 --> 01:31:40.730
You will join me in immortality
soon enough.

01:31:45.038 --> 01:31:47.868
Only the few
will attain this evolution

01:31:48.122 --> 01:31:52.410
and be reborn as Japanese...
the world's strongest race.

01:31:54.504 --> 01:31:57.209
I have done the work of god.

01:31:58.298 --> 01:32:01.167
Maybe I was god all along.

01:32:07.354 --> 01:32:08.591
He's insane.

01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:19.353
But on the eve of completion,

01:32:19.532 --> 01:32:22.814
Japan is empty of
workable specimens.

01:32:24.614 --> 01:32:28.070
But your country abounds in them.

01:32:28.417 --> 01:32:32.157
Healthy subjects
like your dear Leon.

01:33:05.153 --> 01:33:07.145
Nothing divine about you...

01:33:07.996 --> 01:33:09.990
Just another flawed human.

01:33:18.128 --> 01:33:22.626
I had to protect myself for
your sakes against everything.

01:33:22.883 --> 01:33:29.466
Of course I would have the injection
once the virus was safe.

01:33:29.639 --> 01:33:30.759
Such suffering

01:33:30.896 --> 01:33:32.551
for this sicko...

01:33:32.730 --> 01:33:36.514
My research brought you
all eternal life...

01:33:36.817 --> 01:33:41.022
Androids can't act compulsively.

01:33:41.156 --> 01:33:43.356
It doesn't make sense...

01:33:45.945 --> 01:33:49.814
Halt, Saito. Stop it, please.

01:34:05.467 --> 01:34:08.540
The city gates are opening
onto the slums!

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:23.139
You have the citizens' full support.

01:34:26.948 --> 01:34:29.652
This is Chairman Itakura.

01:34:32.202 --> 01:34:37.988
The Council and I were misguided
and betrayed you all.

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:42.829
Now, thanks to your brave resolution

01:34:43.047 --> 01:34:46.912
we can make amends for our mistake.

01:34:54.058 --> 01:34:56.554
Thank you all very much.

01:34:57.139 --> 01:34:58.598
Chairman Itakura...

01:35:35.765 --> 01:35:38.092
Detach the central tunnel
from the island!

01:35:38.224 --> 01:35:40.930
A transporter is en route.

01:35:42.651 --> 01:35:45.931
Do not let it arrive.
Detach the tunnel.

01:35:47.818 --> 01:35:49.896
Don't let it in!

01:36:05.255 --> 01:36:06.449
Darn.

01:36:13.594 --> 01:36:15.249
Piece of junk.

01:36:26.611 --> 01:36:29.974
As long as I have my research

01:36:30.323 --> 01:36:33.561
the world can still be mine.

01:36:43.793 --> 01:36:47.415
The Jags will be here soon.

01:37:38.801 --> 01:37:41.544
I'll get him, you look after Leon.

01:37:41.727 --> 01:37:43.053
No, I'll go after him...

01:37:44.102 --> 01:37:45.928
Not with that leg, you won't.

01:37:49.811 --> 01:37:51.144
Look after Leon for me.

01:40:18.458 --> 01:40:19.868
Maria...

01:40:21.254 --> 01:40:25.499
Why didn't you come to the airport?

01:40:46.906 --> 01:40:49.064
I hate machines

01:40:49.327 --> 01:40:51.567
but humans like you
are far worse.

01:41:00.086 --> 01:41:01.330
Vexille!

01:41:27.697 --> 01:41:28.895
Vexille.

01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:31.614
Where's Maria?

01:41:56.015 --> 01:41:59.510
Stay back, you heap of junk!

01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:01.723
The Jags will get you soon.

01:42:03.188 --> 01:42:04.307
Maria.

01:42:08.576 --> 01:42:10.104
Maria, run!

01:42:11.738 --> 01:42:15.107
Now we'll be together forever.

01:42:45.901 --> 01:42:49.140
Maria!

01:44:57.488 --> 01:45:01.356
<i>Jags across Japan came
to destroy Daiwa</i>

01:45:02.370 --> 01:45:05.192
<i>then sank deep beneath the sea.</i>

01:45:08.705 --> 01:45:11.283
<i>Maria and her kind died off.</i>

01:45:13.093 --> 01:45:19.372
<i>But they left us something vital
we should carry with us.</i>

01:45:21.264 --> 01:45:23.503
<i>It was Maria that taught us</i>

01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.720
<i>as long as we communicate hope
to the next generation</i>

01:45:29.065 --> 01:45:33.180
<i>we ourselves gain eternal existence.</i>
