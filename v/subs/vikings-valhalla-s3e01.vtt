01:16.826 --> 01:18.203
Take this to your mother.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.383
Mother!

01:34.302 --> 01:35.303
I got it.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.018
It is wonderful. Good boy, Harald.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.355
Now, go check your traps for rabbits.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.235
Ships in the harbor!

02:00.578 --> 02:02.413
What took you so long?

02:02.497 --> 02:05.708
You were supposed to be
back from Kattegat two days ago.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.211
How about, "Welcome home, Akí."

02:08.294 --> 02:11.005
"Thank the gods you're still alive.
You didn't drown in a storm."

02:11.089 --> 02:13.550
Did you at least get everything
for the wedding?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.802
Everything. Just like you asked.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.388
Even some sweets for the children.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.182
Take these to the kitchen.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.769
There is much cooking to be done.
Come! No time to waste.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.942
How was Kattegat?

02:31.776 --> 02:34.404
Bustling. Full of boats.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.699
If we had a hundred swords,
we could have traded them all.

02:38.950 --> 02:39.868
We will soon.

02:42.912 --> 02:46.040
Any news about my brother or Harald?

02:46.124 --> 02:48.459
Some say they've seen them
in distant lands.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.044
Africa. Greece.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.257
There are rumors that they fight
for the Emperor of Constantinople.

02:54.841 --> 02:58.511
They're gone but not forgotten, Freydis.
Remembered as heroes.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.849
Thank you for always asking for me, Akí.

03:03.641 --> 03:04.559
Of course.

04:04.827 --> 04:08.248
Your Eminence,
their Emperor has joined the battle.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.630
Hold the line!

04:33.106 --> 04:35.024
Emperor! Emperor!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.317
Forward!

04:36.401 --> 04:39.320
Get the Emperor back! Riders!

04:42.865 --> 04:44.826
Protect the Emperor!

04:53.501 --> 04:54.711
Emperor!

04:55.503 --> 04:56.879
Riders!

05:02.593 --> 05:03.928
Get him back!

05:14.105 --> 05:18.234
Back! Get him back!
Get the Emperor to safety!

05:22.864 --> 05:24.741
Get him to safety!

05:27.702 --> 05:30.413
You brought me here
to witness victory.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.294
And I barely escaped with my life.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.175
If not for my Varangian Guard,

05:42.967 --> 05:45.386
the Saracens we came to conquer

05:45.470 --> 05:48.389
would have brought the Byzantine Empire
to its knees.

05:49.766 --> 05:54.020
Despite what you witnessed, my Emperor,
the siege is working.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.815
They are becoming more desperate
by the day.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.151
The battlefield is littered with our dead.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.780
And while your army remains here,

06:03.863 --> 06:06.991
the center of my empire, Constantinople,

06:07.075 --> 06:10.495
lies undefended and at the mercy
of our enemies in the East.

06:10.578 --> 06:14.332
If we leave Sicily now,
the Emir will be emboldened

06:14.415 --> 06:19.420
and the Saracens will use this victory
to spread their hatred of our God.

06:19.504 --> 06:23.633
They will consolidate their holdings
and not only threaten Constantinople,

06:24.342 --> 06:25.301
but Jerusalem.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.636
Silence!

06:30.098 --> 06:30.973
Prepare your men.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.310
We return home in the morning.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.652
Emperor, if I may…

06:44.862 --> 06:47.365
General Maniakes is not incorrect.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.326
His siege has taken a toll on the enemy.

06:51.661 --> 06:55.498
And though I do not share his passion
for a religious war, I agree.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.126
I believe there is another solution.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.503
Yes, my men have already begun
a new plan--

07:00.586 --> 07:04.048
With respect, General,
I'm not talking about your men.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.299
Or your plan.

07:08.177 --> 07:12.557
I'm saying it is time to let my warriors
deliver you Syracuse.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.936
Your warriors? Your 700 Varangians?

07:17.603 --> 07:20.022
You think they can take that fortress?

07:20.106 --> 07:24.444
They are nothing but a mongrel mix
of lost Vikings and mercenaries.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.448
Vikings are never lost.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.909
And we will take that fortress.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.871
Put them to the side, huh?
You can use them later!

08:29.550 --> 08:31.135
I cannot decide which is worse,

08:31.219 --> 08:34.347
the smell of pig guts
or the stink of the sulfur.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.182
Here.

08:37.725 --> 08:41.604
Spread this beneath your nose.
It will help. A little.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.701
Is that what you're looking for
inside the castle?

08:56.661 --> 08:57.912
It's called a library.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.290
It contains writings from ancient Greece
and Egypt.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.001
Treasures from Africa…

09:05.461 --> 09:06.295
and maps…

09:07.880 --> 09:10.007
of places few people have ever seen.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.634
It's beautiful.

09:17.139 --> 09:17.974
We have enough.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.987
I have informed the Emperor.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.948
We'll be taking the fortress
tomorrow night.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.032
Then you misspoke.

09:37.827 --> 09:38.786
It will be at dawn.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.320
I can get you
through the barbican wall.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.946
The castle is another matter.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.416
Now we go up.

10:31.964 --> 10:35.384
Leif, the noise…
The Saracens will know we're tunneling.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.345
Good. I want them to know.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.227
Easy. Hold. Good.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.273
We are under the wall.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.652
When the time comes, make it loud.

10:54.695 --> 10:55.529
This way.

10:56.489 --> 11:00.076
To where?
You didn't mention a second tunnel.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.663
You didn't ask.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.272
Just in time.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.067
I brought you some help.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.778
Ah.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.949
The future King of Norway, huh!

11:41.075 --> 11:42.701
As soon as we take this castle.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.412
Soon.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.834
Is there really as much treasure inside
as you say?

11:49.917 --> 11:51.043
More, my friend.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.212
Enough to fund all our dreams.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.841
If you don't blow yourselves up first.

11:56.924 --> 11:57.758
My God.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.929
How are you going to light all of this
and get out safely?

12:04.557 --> 12:05.433
We aren't.

12:06.892 --> 12:07.977
They are.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.689
Trust him.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.089
I mean no trouble, friend.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.800
I am just a peaceful traveler.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.428
What are you doing here?

12:44.138 --> 12:45.598
I'm looking for Jomsborg.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.144
- Then why do you come by the forest?
- I don't own a boat.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.146
Just my legs.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.440
He is alone!

12:56.609 --> 12:57.902
What is in your bag?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.862
Just my supplies.

13:02.781 --> 13:03.782
Careful.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.367
The contents are fragile.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.502
Stop!

13:15.794 --> 13:17.004
What is going on?

13:18.839 --> 13:22.718
He says he is looking for Jomsborg
and has evil in his bag.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.348
No evil.
I only said it must be handled with care.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.100
Happy to show you.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.190
You're a healer?

13:37.733 --> 13:38.817
Among other things.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.697
What is this?

13:43.781 --> 13:46.408
Turmeric. It reduces swelling.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.037
Where's it from?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.247
India.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.250
It's a land far east and south.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.876
Have you been there?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.087
Yes, I've been to many places.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.050
Are you a Pagan or a Christian?

14:06.595 --> 14:08.055
I am neither.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.640
But I'm not here to harm you.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.393
My name is Stígr.

14:14.186 --> 14:18.232
- Where did you learn to fight like that?
- I wasn't fighting. I was defending.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.651
Show me.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.362
Now? Here?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.340
You are welcome to stay in Jomsborg.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.093
- But everyone works for their keep.
- I will.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.221
Thank you.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.558
Harald! Come.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.782


15:08.866 --> 15:12.369
Acquiring the blessing
of the Pope is not only a religious duty,

15:12.453 --> 15:14.455
it is a political necessity.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.333
England will be gifted
the southern states of Denmark

15:17.416 --> 15:19.877
and in return,
you will build 200 churches.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.964
Two hundred churches?
On land that I could clearly take?

15:24.715 --> 15:27.635
Yes. But His Holiness
will bestow upon our people

15:28.260 --> 15:31.388
his infinite blessings,
and you cannot put a price upon that.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.473
And yet he has.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.391
And a high one.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.269
When we meet, I will tell him.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.856
Unfortunately, that is not possible,
Your Highness.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.860
You will be speaking to the Pope
through his emissary, the Cardinal.

15:46.111 --> 15:51.325
I am the King of Denmark,
Norway and England.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.702
And he is the supremely powerful Pope.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.581
Ambassador of God
to all Christians on Earth.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.502
His Holiness will see you now.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.060
Yes, it is a matter
for discussion…

16:28.612 --> 16:32.324
May God crown you
with a crown of glory and righteousness.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.889
His Holiness welcomes
this dear son in Christ

16:56.765 --> 17:00.394
and he appreciates the reparation
you've made to the Church

17:00.477 --> 17:03.147
to compensate for the centuries
of pillaging

17:03.230 --> 17:07.693
and desecration that your people
have inflicted on its sacred sites.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.031
To fully attain the atonement, however,

17:12.114 --> 17:16.118
the Holy Father has increased
his request to 300 churches.

17:18.662 --> 17:19.788
300?

17:19.872 --> 17:23.375
Yes. And that he may feel assured
that the agreement is binding,

17:24.126 --> 17:27.004
you will also provide him
with the name of your successor.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.131
An heir?

17:29.214 --> 17:30.132
Ah.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.801
I have not chosen one.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.346
Well, then that is not satisfactory.

17:36.430 --> 17:40.392
Or necessary!
He cannot tell me how to rule my empire!

17:40.476 --> 17:41.727
What is wrong?

17:42.227 --> 17:43.896
It is nothing, Your Holiness.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.524
You're upsetting
the Holy Father.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.777
- Your Highness, I think perhaps--
- What?

17:54.364 --> 17:56.784
Your Holiness, I am Canute the Great.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.412
King of England.
Ruler of the Northern Empire.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.289
Stop. This is not allowed.

18:02.372 --> 18:05.918
And I have traveled many miles
to demonstrate to you my loyalty

18:06.001 --> 18:08.087
and to discuss issues face-to-face.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.546
He cannot understand you.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.757
Then I will ask Godwin
to translate for me.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.427
Godwin! Tell the Pope
that we come here with respect.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.054
What is happening?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.432
You have offended His Holiness
and the Church.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.185
The meeting has ended.
There is no agreement.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.492
Thank you for seeing me, Your Eminence.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.329
Your king is a savage.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.791
While I admit that he is direct,

18:45.874 --> 18:49.670
the past seven years have also proven him
to be a devoted servant to the Church.

18:49.753 --> 18:52.172
Well, that's not
what I've witnessed today.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.635
It's bad enough that to advance
the Christianization of these people,

18:56.718 --> 19:02.766
we have agreed to saint one of them,
the raider, Olaf Haraldsson.

19:03.642 --> 19:07.229
But to have your king attempt to speak
to the Holy Father, as an equal,

19:07.855 --> 19:13.318
shows how little respect he has
for the sanctity of our institutions.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.612
I am here to hopefully alter that opinion.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.957
Well, I'm afraid once my mind
is made up, I'm not easily swayed.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.299
England is a wealthy country.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.218
And I believe that you are a man

19:38.302 --> 19:41.513
capable of finding the path
to forgiveness.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.409
Thank you, brother.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.494
You found work quickly.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.831
Your healer is busy
with wedding preparations.

20:11.168 --> 20:15.964
Where did you get that
red dress? From your sister! Great!

20:16.590 --> 20:18.383
Have you always been a traveler?

20:18.967 --> 20:20.177
Once I was a farmer.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.429
What made you change?

20:23.555 --> 20:25.098
When I was away herding sheep,

20:25.182 --> 20:27.726
my wife and my daughter
were killed by raiders.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.728
So sorry to hear that.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.441
There is much to do.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.694
So what has brought you to Jomsborg?

20:37.778 --> 20:40.822
My grandfather was a Jomsviking
before he moved to Rus.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.368
When I was a child, he'd tell me
exciting stories about his time here.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.537
The battles, the friendships, the feasts…

20:48.247 --> 20:49.831
Did you learn to defend from him?

20:49.915 --> 20:54.544
No. Like my medicines,
I picked it up in India.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.717
I want you to teach my son, Harald.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.137
The training takes time.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.391
And are you in a hurry to leave?

21:09.142 --> 21:09.977
No.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.737
Now, the ancient Greeks
believed that Hephaestus,

21:20.821 --> 21:23.699
blacksmith of the gods,
lived beneath that mountain.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.201
Every time he worked his forge,

21:26.285 --> 21:28.620
that's when the ground shook
and sparks flew.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.376
The Saracens proved that Etna
is not the home of the gods.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.672
The fire that poured out
came from deep down inside the Earth.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.135
Do you ever get tired of knowledge?

21:44.052 --> 21:45.554
No.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.180
No, science is pure.

21:48.515 --> 21:49.433
I yearn for more.

21:52.894 --> 21:56.648
And what I desire most
is inside that citadel.

21:59.484 --> 22:03.989
To me,
knowledge is more valuable than gold.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.910
When we set out for Constantinople
seven years ago,

22:10.078 --> 22:13.957
I promised I would return to Norway
and take back what is mine.

22:16.752 --> 22:20.339
This victory will guarantee
that I have treasures enough to do that.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.384
And then what?

22:26.428 --> 22:27.429
What do you mean?

22:28.764 --> 22:29.890
I know you, my friend.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.727
Your ambition runs as deep as the sea.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.899
Will that be enough to satisfy you?

22:42.027 --> 22:43.028
I know what I want.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.032
And I'm almost there.

22:48.575 --> 22:52.162
I fear that you have placed
too much faith in Harald.

22:52.245 --> 22:54.623
I will not argue
that he is a gifted warrior,

22:54.706 --> 22:56.666
but he is not one of us.

22:57.292 --> 23:00.170
He fights for glory, like all Vikings.

23:00.837 --> 23:01.755
And you do not?

23:02.464 --> 23:06.802
I fight for the glory
of the Byzantine Empire. Nothing else.

23:06.885 --> 23:07.761
Georgios…

23:10.555 --> 23:12.974
your loyalty and courage
is without question.

23:14.142 --> 23:18.313
But your hatred of the Saracen religion
has blinded you.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.943
From the moment you arrived in Sicily,
the Emir has been…

23:23.777 --> 23:24.778
more inventive.

23:25.695 --> 23:28.156
It is time to let someone else
challenge him.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.202
You are risking much if he fails.

23:32.285 --> 23:35.330
I am the Emperor
of the greatest empire on Earth.

23:36.998 --> 23:41.795
I got here by risking much on men
who are willing to risk more.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.018
Speak.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.064
I Christianized my people.

24:02.482 --> 24:05.402
Forced them to give up their gods
and traditions.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.447
Now, I must kneel
and kiss the ring of a man

24:09.531 --> 24:11.700
who will not even meet me face-to-face.

24:13.451 --> 24:16.079
What is to keep me from leaving
this city today?

24:16.663 --> 24:19.457
We benefit enormously
from the support of the Church.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.085
It is the support of hypocrites.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.547
Should the Pope wish to,
he could have you excommunicated.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.340
Shunned.

24:28.466 --> 24:30.302
And England would be alone
in all of Europe.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.555
They judge me because I have killed
to be king, but they forget…

24:34.222 --> 24:35.974
they all have blood on their hands.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.689
My lord, I've spoken with the Cardinal
and we have come to an understanding.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.735
How much will this understanding cost me?

24:48.236 --> 24:49.696
300 solidi.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.908
I do not like it. It is not who I am.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.994
I agree, Your Highness.
But it is what is needed for England.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.797
Do it.

25:11.426 --> 25:12.677
I was there this morning.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.889
I saw how the Cardinal treated Canute.

25:15.972 --> 25:19.559
They are simply not accustomed to men
of your husband's background, my lady.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.437
But fortunately, it has been resolved.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.689
You are naive if you think your bribe

25:24.773 --> 25:26.775
will encourage them to alter
their perception.

25:27.567 --> 25:28.526
It will only harden it.

25:29.653 --> 25:34.324
If we are to truly change their opinions,
I feel we must try a different tact.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.327
I'm afraid it's too late for that,
Your Highness.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.871
And I have dealt with the problem.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.510
Stígr!

27:20.722 --> 27:23.725
- Join us.
- Yes, have something to eat.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.393
I'll have some wine.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.779
- Have you been fighting?
- No.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.617
You look so beautiful, Hrefna. Come.

27:46.456 --> 27:47.874
I'm so happy for you.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.834
- Thank you, Freydis.
- Mother.

27:50.418 --> 27:51.252
Oh!

27:51.836 --> 27:54.798
Do you know what the most powerful weapon
in the world is?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.217
Is it not our new sword?

27:58.176 --> 27:59.219
It is our mind.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.954
I see you have already started
my son's training.

28:27.622 --> 28:28.706
He's a bright boy.

28:32.419 --> 28:35.797
He, um, speaks not of his father, however.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.259
He never knew him.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.136
- Is he dead?
- No…

28:44.222 --> 28:45.181
Not that I know of.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.644
His father and I parted ways
before he knew I was with child.

28:50.895 --> 28:51.813
He was a good man.

29:03.616 --> 29:04.576
<i>Skol!</i>

29:07.370 --> 29:09.080
This place is not what I expected.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.333
It's vibrant and joyous.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.628
You picked a good day to arrive.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.215
You mean… it's not like this every day?

29:25.346 --> 29:26.556
We've had our struggles.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.392
I saw evidence of that in the woods.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.563
We are the last holdout of believers
in the old gods.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.609
All the lands to the north and south
are ruled by Christians.

29:39.235 --> 29:42.781
And their God commands them
to destroy us and our faith.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.909
So we must be vigilant for attacks.

29:46.701 --> 29:47.869
I agree you're surrounded.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.413
But it's a difficult journey
to get here, Freydis.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.291
It has not stopped them before.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.460
So I must keep us ready.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.631
Are these for me?

30:00.381 --> 30:01.633
Aw, thank you so much.

30:05.553 --> 30:06.387
Oh.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.848
I've never seen a leader
who is so loved by her people.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.811
I don't consider myself
a very typical leader.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.524
You are most certainly not typical,
Freydis.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.506
It's been a long wonderful day.

30:47.804 --> 30:48.930
I must let you rest.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.182
Or you can rest with me.

31:53.494 --> 31:54.954
Mmm.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.311
You never were good at waiting, were you?

33:01.354 --> 33:03.815
Patience. It won't be long.

33:39.475 --> 33:42.520
Their tunnel has reached
our wall, Your Eminence.

33:43.104 --> 33:46.149
We calculate that it is less
than two strides from the base.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.403
The Emperor's Varangians…

33:51.237 --> 33:56.034
Yes, Your Eminence.
His… bodyguards.

34:00.496 --> 34:03.750
Why have they chosen our highest ground
in which to attack?

34:04.333 --> 34:07.503
Perhaps it is to catch us by surprise.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.673
But our counter tunnel is finished,

34:11.424 --> 34:14.343
and we will show them the foolishness
of their decision.

34:55.009 --> 34:57.053
Fellow Varangians!

34:59.222 --> 35:01.516
Have I always brought you victory?

35:01.599 --> 35:03.101
Yeah!

35:05.186 --> 35:07.313
Have I ever failed you?

35:07.396 --> 35:09.273
- No!
- Never!

35:13.778 --> 35:15.947
- Go! Before they light it.
- Hurry, Kaysan!

35:36.050 --> 35:38.010
Then you must trust me.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.722
You must follow me
when your eyes tell you not to.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.101
You must have faith.

35:47.103 --> 35:52.400
And if you do, I promise you glory
like you have never known!

36:02.493 --> 36:03.411
Where's Kaysan?

36:04.871 --> 36:06.372
He was sealing off the tunnel.

36:06.956 --> 36:07.790
Go.

36:08.749 --> 36:09.625
Kaysan!

36:12.670 --> 36:14.005
Kaysan!

36:14.797 --> 36:17.258
Kaysan! Hey! Kaysan!

36:42.992 --> 36:46.329
I told you, the Saracens
will collapse their tunnel.

36:48.456 --> 36:49.498
We go!

36:52.293 --> 36:54.879
The Varangians are excellent bodyguards,
Emperor.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.131
- But they are not--
- Shh.

36:57.882 --> 36:58.716
Listen.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.652
Where are they going?

38:03.281 --> 38:04.865
Well, what are you waiting for?

38:04.949 --> 38:08.202
Follow your men! Follow the Varangians!

38:10.329 --> 38:11.747
Hey! Hey!

38:34.937 --> 38:35.771
General!

38:47.783 --> 38:51.287
Your Eminence, we must get you back
to the castle where you'll be safe.

39:39.627 --> 39:40.920
Let's go!

39:44.465 --> 39:46.634
The castle! Yes!
