Queen of Kattegat!

16:17.367 --> 16:20.022
Your son banished me.
Took away everything I had.

16:20.066 --> 16:24.244
My family, my pride,
my identity.

16:24.287 --> 16:27.943
He thought I would
just crawl away to the forest
and die like some animal!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.380
But that is not my way.

16:30.424 --> 16:34.558
I fought for Ivar,
but in other circumstances,
I would have fought for Bjorn.

16:34.602 --> 16:35.907
Or for you!

I am Viking!

16:42.784 --> 16:44.481
I can never get rid of it.

16:44.525 --> 16:47.180
But now I can win back
my self-respect.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.486
I can kill you, Lagertha,

16:49.530 --> 16:52.576

in all the world!

16:52.620 --> 16:54.274
And I will!

16:54.317 --> 16:56.537
My son didn't brand you
for being loyal to Ivar!

16:56.580 --> 16:59.801
He branded you
for being disloyal to Ragnar,

16:59.844 --> 17:01.890
and everything
Ragnar stood for!

17:01.933 --> 17:06.025
And if I have to die
for what Ragnar
and I believed in,

17:06.068 --> 17:08.375
it is worth it.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.986

25:17.124 --> 25:18.995
We trust you, King Harald.
We believe in you.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.432
We believe that everything
will change now.

25:21.476 --> 25:22.999
I gave you my word.

25:23.043 --> 25:24.523
And that's enough for me.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.481
Oh, everything changes.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.136
Who cares about the sons
of Ragnar? Huh?

25:29.179 --> 25:31.965
They are the old rulers,
they are the old elite.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.097
They think they have
a divine right to rule.

25:34.141 --> 25:38.711
Bjorn thought he had
a divine right to win!
But it's not true!

25:38.754 --> 25:41.409
-The people should rule!
-[cheering]

25:41.452 --> 25:42.932
The people should win!

25:42.976 --> 25:45.239
[all cheering]

25:45.282 --> 25:49.722
This is what
our new country is all about!

25:49.765 --> 25:51.158
The people!

25:51.201 --> 25:53.334
[all cheering]

25:53.377 --> 25:56.250
And I am the champion
of the people! I am the King
of the people!

25:56.293 --> 25:58.687
[cheering]

25:58.731 --> 26:01.603
And you can see
by the result!
You believe in me!

26:01.647 --> 26:05.651
-You believe in me! Skol!
-[cheering]

26:10.090 --> 26:11.613
King Olaf!

26:11.657 --> 26:14.050
Everybody, King Olaf!

26:14.094 --> 26:15.704
[crowd booing]

26:15.748 --> 26:18.707
[laughs] I hope you're going
to be true to your word?

26:18.751 --> 26:21.057
You promised that,
whoever won,

26:21.101 --> 26:24.017
you would renounce
your kingdom in his favor.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.453
[cheering]

26:25.496 --> 26:27.107
So, how did you win?

26:28.021 --> 26:30.197
I still don't understand.

26:30.240 --> 26:34.375
You mean because
Bjorn Ironside
was supposed to win?

26:34.418 --> 26:36.072
That's how you planned it?

26:36.116 --> 26:38.379
No wonder people rebelled!

26:38.422 --> 26:40.033
[people cheering]

26:40.076 --> 26:42.122
No one wants to be told
what to do!

26:42.165 --> 26:44.211
Skol!

26:44.254 --> 26:46.953
Skol! Skol, friends!
Feast! [laughs]

26:48.258 --> 26:50.521
My people, my warriors.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.705
What did you promise
to all of them,

26:59.748 --> 27:02.621
that made them all change
their minds?

27:04.100 --> 27:06.146
What do you think
I promised them?

27:08.148 --> 27:11.107
I promised each of them
what they wanted to hear.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.763
Whatever that was.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.244
Whatever that was.

27:17.287 --> 27:20.203
[cheering]

27:20.247 --> 27:25.644
And how do you plan to deliver
on your promise to all of them?

27:27.558 --> 27:28.603
[sniffs]

27:29.256 --> 27:30.387
Who cares?

27:31.998 --> 27:34.348
Listen, you stupid old man!

27:34.391 --> 27:38.221
I always said it was my fate
to become King of all Norway.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.310
And here I am.

27:40.354 --> 27:43.313
But did you really think
I arranged all this?

27:43.357 --> 27:45.141
Don't you think it was fate?

27:45.185 --> 27:47.753
Do you not believe
that the gods were behind it?

27:47.796 --> 27:49.276
Oh, but I forgot.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.365
You don't believe
in our gods anymore!

27:51.408 --> 27:54.324
You don't believe in anything!

27:54.368 --> 27:57.806
You think
everything is just a dream.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.242
[people cheering]

28:03.638 --> 28:05.771
-Let's feast!
-[people cheering]

28:09.600 --> 28:12.778
[Ivar] May I be the first
to congratulate
the bride and the groom

28:12.821 --> 28:14.780
on this momentous day?

28:15.868 --> 28:17.130
Skol!

28:17.173 --> 28:18.261
[Oleg] Skol.

28:20.307 --> 28:23.789
And may Odin, Freyr and Freya
also bless our marriage.

28:23.832 --> 28:26.313
[Katia] Yes. To Odin.
The Allfather.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.184
And to Freyr and Freya.

28:29.185 --> 28:30.230
[Oleg snaps fingers]

28:32.319 --> 28:33.668
-[Ivar] To Odin.
-Skol.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.713
[Ivar] And the gods.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.848
Katia told me that
she reminds you of someone.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.854
Yes.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.163
My wife.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.947
You had a child
with your wife.

28:52.905 --> 28:53.906
No?

28:59.738 --> 29:02.262
How did you know that?

29:02.305 --> 29:04.743
I know a great many things
about you...

29:06.266 --> 29:08.137
Ivar the Boneless.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.532
Am I not a prophet?

29:14.361 --> 29:17.320
Do you mind
if I take off this dress?

29:17.364 --> 29:19.018
It's too hot in here.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.846
Of course, my darling.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.065
I'm sure Ivar won't mind.

29:25.372 --> 29:26.547
Ivar can help.

29:27.809 --> 29:32.248
Can you... undo it, Ivar?

30:01.364 --> 30:02.975
[both gasping]

30:10.156 --> 30:11.200
I don't want to stay.

30:12.636 --> 30:15.770
You have to stay, dear Ivar.

30:15.814 --> 30:19.165
You have to watch.
It's good for you.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.775
[Katia gasping]

30:22.385 --> 30:24.344
[laughing]

30:34.441 --> 30:35.964
[Katia gasping]

30:36.835 --> 30:38.924
[indistinct chatter]

30:46.366 --> 30:47.193
[Harald] Gunnhild.

30:55.201 --> 30:56.158
Gunnhild.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.292
Ah, no.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.533
[chuckles]

31:23.577 --> 31:27.450
I have to thank you,
Ketill Flatnose.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.409
You have been
very helpful to me.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.803
Although I'm
still not sure why.

31:36.416 --> 31:40.246
You can arrange
to send new settlers
to Iceland.

31:41.290 --> 31:42.335
Uh-huh.

31:47.688 --> 31:51.431
I want to be King of Iceland.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.913
And you can make it happen.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.925
So, what will happen
to Bjorn now?

32:08.970 --> 32:12.800
Oh, I have no plans for Bjorn,

32:12.843 --> 32:15.281
but I'm sure he will accept
the verdict of the people.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.512
He is not here.

32:33.255 --> 32:37.477
Once again, I am grateful
for your advice.

32:55.408 --> 32:56.931
[indistinct shouting]

33:02.154 --> 33:03.198
Move.

33:04.678 --> 33:05.896
Where is he?

33:12.686 --> 33:14.905
-Bjorn! You have to leave!
-What do you mean?

33:14.949 --> 33:16.342
Harald is going to kill you!

33:17.560 --> 33:19.562
How do you know?

33:19.606 --> 33:21.869
Don't ask questions.
You must go!
Now, before it's too late!

33:21.912 --> 33:23.218
[banging]

33:26.439 --> 33:28.310
[grunting]

33:40.235 --> 33:41.149
[Bjorn] Ketill!

33:46.633 --> 33:47.416
Let's go!

33:48.635 --> 33:49.723
[groans]

34:02.040 --> 34:03.345
[groaning]

34:06.566 --> 34:07.567
Ketill!

34:08.655 --> 34:10.657
-Ketill!
-I'm sorry, Bjorn!

34:15.662 --> 34:16.402
You see this, Bjorn?

34:20.014 --> 34:22.147
You done this to me.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.062
And now I am going
to do this to you!

34:24.105 --> 34:25.150
[groans]

34:26.673 --> 34:27.761
[grunting]

34:42.863 --> 34:45.648
Come on! Come with me!
I have a boat waiting.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.738
No, we have to take him.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.523
There's no time!
He's too badly wounded!

34:50.566 --> 34:52.873
-[Bjorn] There's still time!
-[groans]

34:52.916 --> 34:55.267
[Bjorn] Get up!
Get up, you fat ass.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.529

35:03.927 --> 35:05.799
Move! Move!

35:05.842 --> 35:06.843

35:11.674 --> 35:13.067
Come on, you fat ass.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.547
[groaning]

35:20.814 --> 35:22.859
Move! Row! Move!

35:26.559 --> 35:29.910
-[Viking] Pull! Row! Row!
-[panting]

35:46.231 --> 35:47.710
[Gunnhild] What are you doing?

35:49.930 --> 35:53.020
I am going back to Kattegat.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.153
I need to tell them
what has happened here.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.505
Maybe Bjorn has come back.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.680
I need to tell my son.

36:03.726 --> 36:04.988
I need to see my son.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.644
I'm coming with you.

36:08.688 --> 36:11.430
No. You are wounded.

36:11.473 --> 36:14.781
And you are with child.
With Bjorn's child.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.132
Blessings.

36:21.091 --> 36:22.702
And if you see Bjorn,

36:22.745 --> 36:24.182
tell him I love him, too.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.273
He cannot escape my love.

36:28.316 --> 36:29.361
I'll tell him.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.191
Look after Asa.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.941
[gasping]

37:00.522 --> 37:01.741
Rest up.

37:08.617 --> 37:10.402
I owe you my life, stranger.

37:12.186 --> 37:14.144
What is your name?

37:14.188 --> 37:16.234
-Erik.
-Just Erik?

37:16.277 --> 37:17.322
Yes.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.631
I don't know why you did
what you did.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.200
Is it because I am a son
of Ragnar?

37:27.027 --> 37:28.376
No.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.205
I am too young
to remember Ragnar.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.816
I did what I did
for Bjorn Ironside.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.255
Where are you from?

37:39.082 --> 37:41.824
I am an outlaw.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.653
As a youth, I was
intemperate, hot-headed.

37:44.697 --> 37:47.613
I got involved in a feud
over the death of some slaves,

37:47.656 --> 37:50.572
killed two of my neighbors
in a fight.

37:50.616 --> 37:53.271
For that, I was banished
from my homeland.

37:54.446 --> 37:55.838
How do you survive?

37:56.796 --> 37:58.276
Move around a lot.

38:00.016 --> 38:02.454
Live in the shadows
with my friends here.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.719
Offer my services
as a warrior...

38:07.372 --> 38:09.156
help people out.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.418
Settle scores...

38:11.680 --> 38:12.855
for money...

38:13.726 --> 38:14.814
or for food.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.819
I am in your debt.

38:19.862 --> 38:22.604
For what it is worth,
I offer you my protection.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.867
That is very kind of you.

38:24.911 --> 38:28.828
But I noticed
that you lost the election.

38:31.744 --> 38:33.615
[sighs]

38:33.659 --> 38:37.053
So, I hope there is a future
for both of us, Bjorn Ironside.

-Who?
-Ivar! Ivar!

41:25.700 --> 41:27.223
He's not coming!

41:27.267 --> 41:29.661
You don't know. You--
You don't hear him.

41:31.053 --> 41:33.360
He's almost here.
He's coming from the sky.

41:33.403 --> 41:37.233
It's not true, Hvitserk!
He's not a god and you know
he's not a god!

41:37.277 --> 41:40.193
[grunting]

41:40.236 --> 41:42.021
You have to sleep.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.805
How can I sleep
when Ivar is coming
to kill me?

41:43.849 --> 41:45.546
Huh? Do you want him
to kill me?

41:45.590 --> 41:46.547
No, of course I don't.

41:46.591 --> 41:48.462
Then shut your mouth!

41:48.506 --> 41:50.508
This is between him and me!

41:50.551 --> 41:52.858
His fate and my fate!

41:52.901 --> 41:54.163
[thunder rumbling]

41:54.207 --> 41:56.905
It's here.
[gasping] It's arrived!

41:58.124 --> 41:59.778
You mustn't go out.

41:59.821 --> 42:01.954
You're sick, Hvitserk. Sick.

42:01.997 --> 42:03.782
If you go out,
what will you do?

It is what
the Seer foretold...

43:55.763 --> 43:57.547
that one day...

43:57.591 --> 43:59.637
I would be killed
by a son of Ragnar.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.902
[Hvitserk breathing shakily]

44:09.168 --> 44:10.865
I could not escape it.

44:11.736 --> 44:12.780
Nor could you.

44:17.045 --> 44:19.657
Weep not, poor Hvitserk.

44:19.700 --> 44:25.184
Tonight I will sit
with my beloved Ragnar
in the halls of the gods.
