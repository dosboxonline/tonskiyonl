00:01.069 --> 00:02.670
[Ragnar]
Previously on Vikings...

00:02.703 --> 00:05.239
[Harald] I have to appoint
a new head of my bodyguard.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.909
I wondered if you would
accept the position.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.045
We should try
and settle this empty land.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.646
[Ubbe] I suggest
that our next move

00:12.680 --> 00:14.782
be to parcel up the land
between all of the families.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.551
You can't have Bjorn anymore.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.919
You can have me.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.055
Ivar has joined forces
with my brother.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.790
We have to prepare
for an attack.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.725
The challenges are great,
but we must act.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.160
Why did you want to be Queen?

00:26.194 --> 00:27.928
Because I'm carrying
Bjorn's child.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.797
It's our child.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.465
How can you possibly
contemplate marrying
King Harald?

00:31.499 --> 00:32.833
I have no advantages.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.835
Come, quickly! Look!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.604
The whale has washed up
on my property.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.239
I thought we were
all in this together.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.607
The gods decide.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.942
The time of great heroes
is over, Bjorn.

00:41.975 --> 00:45.746
Perhaps the Golden Age
of the Vikings is gone.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.781
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:38.266 --> 01:40.033
[tools clinking]

01:42.603 --> 01:43.771
[grunts]

01:45.439 --> 01:47.341
[breathing heavily]

01:52.079 --> 01:53.781
[grunting]

01:54.615 --> 01:55.883
[sighs]

02:02.390 --> 02:05.193
[Othere] I don't believe
Ketill will share.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.362
[Ubbe] They must share,
otherwise some of us
will perish.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.331
[Othere] He doesn't
care about that.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.500
[Ubbe] Well, he must.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.769
[Othere] You don't understand.
Ketill will kill anyone
on his path.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.571
He claimed Iceland
by violence.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.708
Killed the only family
who could challenge him.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.042
And he'll do the same here.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.979
Did he kill Floki?

02:27.281 --> 02:29.016
Of course
he killed Floki.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.751
Floki would have
been King of Iceland.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.254
Everyone knew that,
and Ketill had to
deal with him.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.689
[sighs]

02:35.723 --> 02:38.926
Now, I don't know
where it happened.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.462
And I have no proof.

02:43.431 --> 02:46.434
But I know
Ketill killed Floki
one way or another.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.771
What to do?

02:54.775 --> 02:56.076
Just be prepared.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.784
[woman 1] We need
the heavy ones!

03:09.757 --> 03:10.991
[woman 2] Come on!

03:11.024 --> 03:12.626
[indistinct chatter]

03:21.469 --> 03:23.203

-[laughs]

03:33.213 --> 03:35.148
[Ivar chuckles]

03:35.182 --> 03:37.951
It's time to go.
It's time to go.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.720
-Come on.
-Ow!

03:39.753 --> 03:41.121
-Come on.
-[sighing] Yes.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.191
[chuckles]

03:44.224 --> 03:45.526
[speaks in native tongue]

03:45.559 --> 03:47.227

03:59.239 --> 04:01.309
[drumming continues]

04:20.894 --> 04:22.563
[indistinct chatter]

04:44.718 --> 04:47.521
[Erik] Wonder what he would
think if he knew he was
marrying a witch.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.591
He knows.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.360
[clicks tongue] He knows.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.895
Yes, and he doesn't care.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.933
So you have no power
over me, Erik.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.835
You can't reveal
anything to Harald.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.104
You can't shame me.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.907
And you can't sell me
into slavery.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.410
-What?
-You heard.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.413
It was always
your profession of choice.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.916
Everybody sells slave.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.959
You don't know
anything about me.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.300
I know this.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.669
You sold me once.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.072
You don't remember?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.909
Of course you don't.
But I remember.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.277
How could I forget?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.418
What do you want me to say?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.086
Nothing.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.156
Now leave.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.992
I'm making my wedding dress.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.905
[sighs]

06:11.939 --> 06:13.306
Can you see the future?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.650
-[all yelling]
-We need food!

06:22.683 --> 06:25.252
My son is starving!

06:25.285 --> 06:27.455
[man] Get out of here!

06:27.488 --> 06:28.856
You can't have it!

06:29.723 --> 06:31.091
What do you want?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.292
A fair share!

06:32.325 --> 06:33.794
You'll get your share.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.196
-Not from you!
-We've come to take it.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.765
If you step foot on my land,

06:37.798 --> 06:39.199
you will have made
your own death!

06:39.232 --> 06:41.802
Listen to him, he means it!
Go away!

06:41.835 --> 06:44.204
Go back! Please!

06:44.237 --> 06:46.073
[indistinct yelling]

06:47.174 --> 06:49.209
[woman] We need food!

06:49.242 --> 06:52.780
If anyone steps foot
on my land, they will die!

06:52.813 --> 06:55.315
What is the point
in this, Ketill, huh?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.785
The whale washed ashore
on my land!

06:57.818 --> 07:00.087
You have to share it!

07:00.120 --> 07:01.822
[Ketill] It is a gift
from the gods!

07:01.855 --> 07:04.825
It... It was sent to me.
What else can it mean?

07:04.858 --> 07:07.294
Have you lost your mind, hmm?

07:07.327 --> 07:09.196
The god have chosen me.

07:09.229 --> 07:12.032
You don't care if everyone
else here just dies.

07:12.065 --> 07:15.368
I am King here!
I will decide who starves.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.304
You won't, you murderer!

themselves over the body

[Torvi] What are we
going to do?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.695
All shall be well,
and all manner of things
shall be well.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.537
Look at me. [chuckles]

09:30.570 --> 09:32.472
I am King of Greenland.

on your promotion.

Thank you.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.611
[chittering continues]

11:22.716 --> 11:24.417
We could still be lovers.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.320
What?

11:29.089 --> 11:31.224
After the marriage.
Why not?

11:33.026 --> 11:36.830
Harald trusts me now.
I saved his life.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.132
And the first thing
you want to do is betray him?

11:39.166 --> 11:41.134
[chittering continues]

11:42.469 --> 11:43.771
You don't love him.

I'm telling you, it's a trap.

[horse whinnies]

13:53.633 --> 13:54.767
Who's that?

14:15.555 --> 14:17.390
Prince Dir,

14:17.424 --> 14:19.159
the army of Kiev
salutes you,

14:19.192 --> 14:21.394
and offers you,
and Prince Igor,

14:21.428 --> 14:25.232
our profound love and loyalty
from this day forward.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.599
By the grace of God.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.870
Thank you.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.706
By the grace of God. Amen.

[speaks in native tongue]

14:57.530 --> 14:59.499
[cheering continues]

15:15.448 --> 15:17.917
They came to a place
called Golgotha,

15:17.951 --> 15:20.587
which means,
"the place of the skull."

15:20.620 --> 15:23.656
There, they offered
Jesus wine to drink,

15:23.690 --> 15:25.358
mixed with gall.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.661
But after tasting it,
He refused to drink.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.664
When they had crucified Him...

15:34.534 --> 15:36.536
they divided up
His clothes by lot.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.238
[breathing heavily]

15:42.009 --> 15:45.945
Above His head,
they placed the written
charge against Him.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.515
"This is Jesus,
the King of the Jews."

15:50.350 --> 15:53.620
Those who passed by
hurled insults at Him,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.522
shaking their heads
and saying,

15:55.555 --> 16:00.660
"Come down from the cross
if you are the Son of God."

16:00.693 --> 16:05.498
In the same way,
the chief priests
and the elders mocked Him.

16:05.532 --> 16:09.436
"He saved others," they said,
"but He can't save himself.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.271
He's the King of Israel.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.373
Let Him come down
from the cross...

16:14.941 --> 16:16.609
and we'll believe Him."

16:33.626 --> 16:34.627
[gasps]

16:39.566 --> 16:41.568
He trusts in God.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.571
Let God rescue Him now
if He wants Him,

16:44.604 --> 16:46.739
for He said,

16:46.773 --> 16:48.275
"I am the Son of God."

17:08.161 --> 17:10.630
"I am the Son of God."

-[chatter dies down]

18:08.355 --> 18:10.457
Let us all
live in peace together.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.660
Let us live as God intended.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.730
Let us talk

18:17.764 --> 18:20.032
and forever put
our differences aside.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.368
[breathing heavily]

18:22.702 --> 18:26.072
[sniffles] Igor,
I love you like a son.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.079
And you, Ivar,
like a brother.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.017
[Dir] Don't believe him.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.187
He doesn't believe in love.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.088
It's a joke, he's lying.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.657
For God's sake,

18:44.691 --> 18:46.193
for the love of God...

18:47.427 --> 18:49.729
for everything
that is holy,

18:49.762 --> 18:52.899
let us live in peace
and love, please.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.703
My brothers...

18:58.571 --> 19:01.808
God sees into our hearts.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.312
Let us love one another.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.382
It's all I ask.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.853
Oh, my brother in Christ,

19:13.886 --> 19:15.388
it is all I ask.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.193
Nothing more.

19:20.227 --> 19:23.530
Take this bow and arrow
and kill your uncle.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.266
-God commanded...
-Don't be a cripple anymore.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.934
...to forgive one another.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.602
I don't know.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.906
Perhaps, in his own way,

19:33.940 --> 19:36.243
he does love me.

19:36.276 --> 19:39.078
If we don't kill him,
you will never be free.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.613
I love you, you know that.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.650
Let me help you.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.654
[Oleg] I offer myself
up for you.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.499
-No, no, wait.
-[crowd gasps]

20:02.034 --> 20:03.336
Let me kill him.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.305
Let me do it.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.282
No, Igor.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.816
Not you!

20:16.849 --> 20:17.684
No!

20:20.987 --> 20:22.955
I'm sorry.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.424
-[arrow stabbing]
-[crowd gasps]

20:25.325 --> 20:26.493
[gasps]

20:30.497 --> 20:31.498
[groans]

20:33.500 --> 20:35.167
[breathing heavily]

20:45.512 --> 20:47.013
[gasping]

20:50.016 --> 20:51.784
Father, forgive them...

20:53.152 --> 20:55.154
for they know not
what they do.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.177
[body thuds]

22:07.527 --> 22:09.462
[indistinct shouting]

22:22.074 --> 22:23.342
[indistinct chatter]

22:55.542 --> 22:57.677
[speaking in native tongue]

23:15.261 --> 23:16.295
[drums beating]

23:52.431 --> 23:53.766
[drumming stops]

23:59.539 --> 24:00.807
[exhales deeply]

24:32.238 --> 24:33.439
[drumming]

25:04.136 --> 25:05.738
[drumming stops]

25:05.772 --> 25:08.374
You came.

25:08.407 --> 25:11.143
I want to wish you and Ingrid
every happiness.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.915
Then you're not joining us
in matrimony?

25:15.948 --> 25:17.216
No.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.618
I cannot marry you.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.623
I don't understand.

25:23.656 --> 25:27.093
In my heart,
I am still married to Bjorn.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.667
Now I have to go.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.002
Where are you going?

25:37.203 --> 25:38.370
To my love.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.944
-Gunnhild.
-Leave her alone.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.145
Let her be.

25:57.824 --> 26:00.326
I go now to join Bjorn...

26:01.393 --> 26:02.762
in Valhalla.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.500
In Valhalla.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.519
[waves splashing]

29:50.990 --> 29:54.026
[Torvi] So we survived,
which is the main thing.

29:55.194 --> 29:58.030
But where are we going?

29:58.064 --> 30:01.733
[Ubbe] At the moment,
wherever the wind and
the tides take us.

30:01.767 --> 30:03.302
We have no idea where we are.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.705
And we have no sunstone.

30:06.738 --> 30:08.908
And we have no food.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.442
[Ubbe] We will find food.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.513
But we have no water.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.748
If we have no water,
we will be dead anyway.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.785
[Othere] God will provide.

30:21.287 --> 30:23.122
I wished I believed
in your God.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.161
Where did you learn
to fight like that.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.762
What?

30:30.796 --> 30:33.232
You're a priest.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.701
You went to the seminary,
you became a missionary.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.069
That's what you said.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.806
And who taught you
to use weapons like that?

30:40.839 --> 30:43.142
Where did you learn
to fight like a warrior?

30:44.944 --> 30:47.413
I sailed to Byzantium.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.782
I was taught by some
of the greatest fighters
in the world.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.187
Where is Byzantium?

30:55.221 --> 30:56.889
It's where the Emperor sits.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.593
Why would they
teach you to fight?

31:01.627 --> 31:04.931
So I could serve in his
personal bodyguard, of course.

31:04.964 --> 31:09.101
He always chose Vikings
to serve in his bodyguard.

31:09.135 --> 31:12.738
You told us you were
a Saxon monk.

31:12.771 --> 31:16.408
No, I told you the real
Othere was a Saxon monk.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.377
I took his identity.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.146
And I took his faith.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.817
You have lied and lied
and lied, my friend Othere.

31:25.851 --> 31:28.187
[Othere] I have only
spoken the truth.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.757
Nobody likes the truth.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.892
They hear only what
they want to hear.

31:33.926 --> 31:37.063
The truth is that we are
probably going to die.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.864
Is that my fault?

31:40.199 --> 31:41.934
No.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.970
No, it's mine.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.972
I believe your stories.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.317
Look.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.421
[grunts]

32:05.891 --> 32:08.094
I don't believe it.

32:08.127 --> 32:11.730
Sometimes you have to believe.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.666
[indistinct murmuring]

32:31.850 --> 32:33.819
-[Othere chuckles]
-Catch it!

32:33.852 --> 32:35.654
Catch the rain!

32:35.687 --> 32:37.023
[grunts]

32:37.056 --> 32:38.290
[indistinct chatter]

32:38.324 --> 32:39.525
[all laughing]

32:54.806 --> 32:58.977
[sighs] And it falleth like
the gentle rain from heaven.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.114
[laughing]

33:02.148 --> 33:03.715
Oh!

33:03.749 --> 33:05.684
[indistinct chatter]

33:07.886 --> 33:09.421
[indistinct shouting]

33:26.772 --> 33:28.440
[Dir] It's Igor.

33:28.474 --> 33:29.908
[laughter]

33:53.465 --> 33:55.801
So, what are your
plans now, Ivar?

33:57.002 --> 33:58.137
I don't know.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.306
Depends.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.708
On what?

34:02.741 --> 34:03.809
On you.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.178
You know that.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.418
But I am here now,
back with my family.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.087
[snickers]

34:15.121 --> 34:17.256
So, they matter
more than I do.

34:21.093 --> 34:22.294
I am sorry.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.671
[snickers]

34:34.640 --> 34:35.841
Don't worry.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.278
I have other ambitions.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.815
To do?

34:43.849 --> 34:45.551
Some unfinished business.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.054
Don't worry about me.

34:49.788 --> 34:50.789
Hmm?

34:53.992 --> 34:55.361
Then I'm happy

34:57.163 --> 34:58.530
if you won't blame me.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.203
How would I ever blame you?

35:08.207 --> 35:09.175
[sighs]

35:11.677 --> 35:13.545
Because I'm carrying
your child.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.482
-[music stops]
-[all cheering]

35:16.515 --> 35:19.585
[Dir] Listen, people.
People! Listen.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.856
We have overthrown a tyrant

35:24.890 --> 35:28.160
whose only ambition was
to make himself the king
of the Rus.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.297
Oleg was my brother.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.831
But even so,

35:32.864 --> 35:35.734
I could not allow that
to happen to my country!

35:35.767 --> 35:39.205
Nor could I allow that
to happen to my young
nephew Igor,

35:39.238 --> 35:40.806
-the true heir to this land!
-[all cheering]

35:54.119 --> 35:57.022
But none of this could
have been possible

35:57.055 --> 36:01.126
without the intervention of
our two Viking brothers.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.861
[people clamoring]

36:06.432 --> 36:08.400
We salute you all.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.404
-Skol!
-[all] Skol!

36:14.540 --> 36:15.874

37:08.294 --> 37:09.695
[priest speaking
in native tongue]

38:04.082 --> 38:06.318
[softly] Do you want to
stay here in Kiev?

38:08.387 --> 38:09.821
Do you?

38:09.855 --> 38:11.222
Oh, no.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.763
Katia is carrying my child.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.166
-Your child?
-Yes.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.669
My child.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.040
But I know she doesn't
want me to stay.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.242
[Hvitserk exhales]

38:39.718 --> 38:43.088
So, are you coming with me?

38:45.591 --> 38:46.758
Where to?

38:46.792 --> 38:47.959
[singing continues]

38:55.401 --> 38:57.803
Well, we don't know
what happened there
since Bjorn died.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.405
Well, then we'll find out.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.673
[singing continues]

39:06.277 --> 39:08.580
Why do you hesitate?

39:08.614 --> 39:10.882
-Why do you even ask?
-[snickers]

39:10.916 --> 39:12.984
You know we're fated
to stay together.

39:15.253 --> 39:18.824
Since either you
will kill me or I you.

39:19.825 --> 39:20.926
Hmm.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.328
[sighs] Hmm.

39:31.336 --> 39:33.439
May God bless you
and keep you this day

39:33.472 --> 39:35.841
and all the days of
your life, my friend.

39:47.352 --> 39:49.120
Farewell then, Ivar.

39:54.092 --> 39:59.197
I promise that our child
will be blessed

40:00.198 --> 40:01.833
and will want for nothing.

40:04.202 --> 40:07.338
And I will make sure
he knows

40:07.372 --> 40:10.709
that his father is
Ivar, the Boneless.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.845
A king

40:14.713 --> 40:16.314
and a great man.

40:19.785 --> 40:22.621
You tell me you love me, Ivar,
but you don't.

40:24.189 --> 40:27.258
You loved your wife Freydis.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.828
And in your mind
you confuse me with her.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.298
But I am not her,

40:33.331 --> 40:36.568
and I will only disappoint you
when you realize it.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.140
That is why
you have to go.

41:04.663 --> 41:05.997
[Ivar grunts]

41:14.773 --> 41:16.007

41:30.522 --> 41:32.223
[man shouting
in native tongue]

41:50.208 --> 41:51.442
Ivar!

41:59.951 --> 42:01.052
[Igor] Ivar!

42:02.520 --> 42:03.722
[both laughing]

42:08.960 --> 42:10.596
They told me
you were leaving.

42:12.798 --> 42:14.633
You can't.
I... I won't allow it.

42:14.666 --> 42:18.036
I own all the land. I own
the sky and the clouds.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.571
But you do not own me.

42:23.008 --> 42:24.309
So it's true.

42:25.243 --> 42:26.645
You are leaving.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.451
You are not
a child anymore.

42:34.986 --> 42:37.656
Only a man can be king.

42:37.689 --> 42:40.458
And a man must
put aside childish things

42:40.491 --> 42:43.061
and he must learn how to
stand on his own feet.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.462
[chuckles]

42:46.531 --> 42:48.166
Everyone here loves you.

42:49.868 --> 42:52.804
I wouldn't go if I didn't
think you were safe.

42:52.838 --> 42:54.272
You're safe.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.208
And you will be king.

43:03.281 --> 43:04.549
[snickers]

43:07.018 --> 43:08.153
Let's go.

43:18.163 --> 43:19.330
You've changed.

43:20.065 --> 43:21.633
[scoffs]

43:21.667 --> 43:24.803
We never really change,
we just think that we do.

43:24.836 --> 43:27.005
Nah, you've changed.

43:42.220 --> 43:44.222
[music playing]
