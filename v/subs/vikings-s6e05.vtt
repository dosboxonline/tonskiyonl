["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:04.064 --> 01:06.022
[indistinct chatter]

01:16.337 --> 01:17.729
Jarl Thorkell!

01:17.773 --> 01:19.775
-[Thorkell] King Olaf.
-Greetings!

01:19.818 --> 01:21.646
-Welcome.
-I was surprised

01:21.690 --> 01:23.300
to receive your summons.

01:23.344 --> 01:24.780
Is it really true

01:24.823 --> 01:27.609
that you want us all to vote
for a king of all Norway?

01:28.653 --> 01:30.177
If it wasn't true

01:30.220 --> 01:34.529
I wouldn't have wasted
your time by summoning
you here.

01:34.572 --> 01:38.141
You are asking us all
to renounce

01:38.185 --> 01:41.188
that which is most dear
and precious to us.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.668
Our power.

01:43.712 --> 01:46.323
Oh, Thorkell,

01:46.367 --> 01:51.067
your power resides
in your prestige.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.331
In the willingness
of your warriors to fight

01:54.375 --> 01:55.767
and die for you.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.204
That will not change.

01:57.247 --> 02:01.599
All I am asking,
that there should be
an overlord,

02:01.643 --> 02:05.516
to whom we could all
owe our allegiance.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.564
A king of all Norway
who will defend us

02:09.607 --> 02:12.567
from all external forces.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.960
That is my dream.

02:15.004 --> 02:18.921
Surely that's not
too much to ask, is it?

02:24.579 --> 02:26.102
[horses approach]

02:29.410 --> 02:30.976
[child making bird call]

02:46.383 --> 02:48.298
[Lagertha] Thank the gods!

02:48.342 --> 02:49.647
You're here.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.696
[exhales]

02:56.350 --> 02:57.220
But why?

02:58.830 --> 03:01.398
I had a dream, Lagertha.

03:01.442 --> 03:04.445
And in my dream,
your village was attacked.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.098
So, I wanted to be with you.

03:06.142 --> 03:08.623
You and Torvi's children.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.147
I was afraid that
something had happened.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.716
Hali is dead.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.414
[exhales]

03:17.458 --> 03:18.415
It was my fault.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.374
I did not protect him.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.679
I failed.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.944
He's buried not far
from a village

03:25.988 --> 03:28.425
which he tried to protect.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.862
With all the others
who also died in the raid.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.299
So it's true?

03:32.342 --> 03:35.998
Your dream? Yes.
We were attacked by bandits.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.130
The same bandits that
Bjorn branded and released.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.958
Then, perhaps
Bjorn made a mistake?

03:40.002 --> 03:41.264
He should never
have released them.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.484
Don't talk of mistakes!
We all make mistakes,

03:43.527 --> 03:47.227
sometimes for bad reasons
and sometimes for good ones.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.707
In any case,

03:49.751 --> 03:51.840
it is not important anymore.

03:51.883 --> 03:54.016
What's important
is that I am certain,

03:54.059 --> 03:56.192
since they did not manage
to steal our grain,

03:56.236 --> 03:58.194
that they will attack
again soon.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.676
It is a good thing
that we are here.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.808
We have to make plans.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.637
Even with your shield-maidens,

04:06.681 --> 04:09.423
I'm not sure we can resist
White Hair and his bandits,

04:09.466 --> 04:11.251
not a second time.

04:13.688 --> 04:17.648
Those are not words
I ever expected to hear
from Lagertha,

04:17.692 --> 04:19.476
the famous shield-maiden.

04:22.174 --> 04:25.265
Perhaps that Lagertha
is already dead.

04:27.528 --> 04:29.225
I buried her myself.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.620
Then I had to dig her up again.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.275
But she is not the same.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.147
She can never be the same.

Come on!

05:07.437 --> 05:08.960
Yes, yes! Come on!

Come on!

Come on, guys! Come on!
Go on! Help me!

05:23.540 --> 05:26.282
Come on! Come on! Help me!

05:26.326 --> 05:30.547
Yes! Well done! You!
You push! You! You push!

05:30.591 --> 05:31.722
Push! Come on!

05:34.638 --> 05:36.074
Push! Come on, help push!

05:36.118 --> 05:38.076
Hvitserk! What is this?

05:38.120 --> 05:42.037
This is one of the iron gates
that Ivar made
to protect the town.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.170
But what do you want it for?

05:46.128 --> 05:49.087
I need it
for my own protection!

05:49.131 --> 05:51.046
It's the only way
to keep out the ghosts!

05:53.701 --> 05:57.661
Go on! Push it! Come on!

05:57.705 --> 06:01.796

[woman 2] Come,
Inge. Come.
Bring some more!

06:17.855 --> 06:19.379
[man] Who did this?

06:22.686 --> 06:23.818
Hi!

06:34.829 --> 06:36.657
[woman 4] Yeah. Keep going.
Yeah. One more.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.441
[woman 5]
Bring it over here.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.661
[Lagertha grunts]

06:40.704 --> 06:44.360
[woman 5] Good, huh?
It's finished. Next one.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.455
[girl 2 making bird call]

06:54.979 --> 06:56.416
They won't expect this.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.506
No.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.421
But who knows if it's enough?

07:07.644 --> 07:09.254
Have you heard anything
from Bjorn?

07:13.737 --> 07:14.999
I know he will return.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.091
Yes.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.485
[man] Yes, push against it.
That's it. Good.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.096
Look!

07:33.670 --> 07:37.108
[woman 2] Fasten it more!
Not with that--
Not with that rope,

07:37.152 --> 07:38.675
with the good rope.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.242
Yes, that's right.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.984
[man 2] Hard work.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.464
[woman 3] Oh, I'm tired.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.640
[grunts]

07:55.692 --> 07:56.867
Poor Asa.

07:58.739 --> 07:59.783
[chuckles]

07:59.827 --> 08:01.002
[woman] Smells good.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.179
I cannot wait for that.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.920
[woman 2] I was so thirsty.
[woman 1] Yes.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.399
[woman 3] Too much.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.532
[woman 1] It will be.
Worth the wait.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.492
[woman 4]
Who does she think she is?

08:14.885 --> 08:17.192
[woman 3] Of course.
It's a long way.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.587
What is it that you see?

08:22.197 --> 08:24.547
[Runa] I see myself, Lagertha.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.897
That's how I was,
all those years ago.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.247
That's how we all were.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.162
[Runa] It's like seeing ghosts.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.559
[Eira] For some reason,
I want to weep.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.910
But for as much joy
to see myself again.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.479
Come. Join our feast.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.655
We will be
shield-maidens together.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.527

Look at me, Hvitserk.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.625
Go away! Go away!

09:42.669 --> 09:44.671
Ivar did this to me.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.282
Look at me!

09:48.152 --> 09:49.589
Don't be afraid.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.510
Why have you come back here?

09:59.424 --> 10:00.774
Why do you want to haunt me?

10:00.817 --> 10:03.864
I want revenge.

10:03.907 --> 10:08.695
The only person who can avenge
my death, Hvitserk, is you!

10:08.738 --> 10:10.914
Tell me! Tell me how!

10:10.958 --> 10:13.787
You have to kill Ivar.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.440
Ivar killed me.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.617
He killed my family.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.272
You will do it, won't you?

10:22.360 --> 10:23.927
You will avenge me?

10:23.971 --> 10:26.321
-Yes.
-Promise.

10:27.844 --> 10:29.759
Swear on your sacred arm ring.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.288
[whimpering]

10:37.724 --> 10:39.029
I swear.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.470
I swear. I swear.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.472
I... I told you, I swear!

11:02.096 --> 11:03.445
[Viking] Pull!

11:03.488 --> 11:04.794
[Viking 2] Keep pulling!

11:04.838 --> 11:06.448
[Viking 3] Oars!

11:06.491 --> 11:08.537
[Viking 1]
Prepare for the approach.
We are almost there!

-[grunting]
-[crowd cheers]

11:41.788 --> 11:44.704
I, uh... I would like
to propose a toast

11:46.140 --> 11:48.316
to Bjorn Ironside.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.796
This is our first meeting,

11:49.839 --> 11:52.886
but over the years I've heard
all about your exploits

11:52.929 --> 11:54.931
from the wanderers
and poets in my Great Hall.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.934
It's a great honor
to meet you
in person at last

11:57.978 --> 11:59.153
Skol.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.632
Skol.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.243
[all] Skol.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.897
You are too kind.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.943
But I too have heard stories
of Thorkell the Tall

12:06.987 --> 12:09.729
and his brothers
Herring and Earl Sigvald.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.993
In a country such as ours,
as small as ours,

12:13.036 --> 12:14.124
fame spreads easily.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.213
So they say, Bjorn Ironside.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.693
[Thorkell] So, the plan

12:17.737 --> 12:21.392
is for all of us
to appoint you as king?

12:21.436 --> 12:24.874
Elect him as king, elect.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.658
That is our way.

12:26.702 --> 12:29.879
In which case, King Olaf,
I insist that it must be
a real election.

12:29.923 --> 12:34.057
And that anyone else,
be he a king or even
a simple Jarl like me,

12:34.101 --> 12:35.885
can also stand, if they wish.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.802
Oh, in principle, yes.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.543
But you know

12:41.586 --> 12:44.676
how we Norwegians are.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.810
You give them a chance
to quarrel and to fight,

12:47.854 --> 12:51.771
and then they will
quarrel and fight.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.338
Still,
Jarl Thorkell has a point.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.427
Yes. And I agree with him.

12:56.471 --> 12:59.822
Personally, I would never
want to be made king
in an uncontested election.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.913
I have no desire
to wear a hollow crown.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.615
As you wish, Bjorn Ironside.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.879
As you wish.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.143
[grunting]

13:17.057 --> 13:18.493
[crowd cheering]

13:22.366 --> 13:24.020
[laughter]

13:29.286 --> 13:31.462
[indistinct chatter]

13:37.904 --> 13:39.557
Bjorn Ironside.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.736
Jarl Hrolf.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.698
Welcome.

13:50.786 --> 13:53.136
I hope we have
the opportunity to talk.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.312
I hope so too, Bjorn Ironside.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.707
Really, I do.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.976
Ah, King Hakon!

14:07.020 --> 14:09.022
Bjorn Ironside.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.719
You don't know this,

14:10.762 --> 14:12.939
but I fought beside you
and your father
at the gates of Paris.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.201
Ah!

14:14.244 --> 14:16.377
I was a young man then,

14:16.420 --> 14:18.509
and I still had a right hand.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.033
What happened to your hand?

14:20.076 --> 14:22.905
In a sea battle against him...

14:22.949 --> 14:24.559
Thorkell the Tall.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.604
I was boarding his ship.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.041
The deck was slippery.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.739
I put out my hand
to steady myself

14:30.782 --> 14:32.828
and somebody took
the opportunity to remove it.

14:33.481 --> 14:34.917
[Hakon chuckles]

14:34.961 --> 14:37.485
But now it seems
we never have to fight again.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.269
Not against each other.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.358
Why fight our own countrymen?

14:41.402 --> 14:42.794
It's what we've always done.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.840
That doesn't make it
right or sensible.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.625
The fact is,
we need to unify Norway

14:47.669 --> 14:50.585
to withstand possible attacks
from our larger neighbors,

14:50.628 --> 14:52.108
like Sweden or Denmark.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.981
I agree, it does make
some sort of sense.

14:55.024 --> 14:58.898
And to have a figurehead
like you, Bjorn Ironside,
huh?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.421
Son of Ragnar,

15:00.464 --> 15:03.337
who is known and respected
throughout our Viking world.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.947
Makes even more sense,
I have to say.

15:07.080 --> 15:07.907
You have my vote,

15:08.951 --> 15:10.344
Bjorn Ironside.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.960
Two more ships
have just arrived.

15:18.004 --> 15:21.572
Who knew there were
so many kings and earls
in Norway?

15:21.616 --> 15:24.401
It seems that they
grow on trees.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.795
Yes. Let me greet
the newcomers.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.885
I can explain our purpose
as well as you do.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.931
Thank you, my friend.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.288
[horse whinnies]

15:41.331 --> 15:42.985
[Rus captain calling out]

15:50.906 --> 15:51.994
My prince.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.170
I'm sure you can hear me.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.303
But you are probably counting
all the furrows

15:56.346 --> 15:59.915
in the lands and the clouds
in the sky that belong to you.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.527
But I want to talk
of something else.

16:03.571 --> 16:08.706
I want to ask you
if you would like to play
a trick on poor Dir.

16:11.231 --> 16:14.321
[Igor] What kind of trick,
my dear Boneless?

16:14.364 --> 16:17.324
Something that will
amuse you, I hope.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.326
I like to be amused.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.545
Is it a magic trick?

16:21.589 --> 16:23.504
I like magic tricks.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.332
Yes. It's a magic trick.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.724
What do you say?

16:26.768 --> 16:28.988
Would you like
to help me do it?

16:31.599 --> 16:33.862
What are we going to do,
my fellow king?

16:35.211 --> 16:36.169
[chuckles]

16:39.302 --> 16:40.695
[dog barking]

16:50.400 --> 16:51.836
Guards!

16:58.191 --> 16:59.844
Don't just stand there gawping.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.630
Let's see what she's up to!

17:02.673 --> 17:04.110
[guard 1] Who is she?

17:13.858 --> 17:16.035
[breathing heavily]

17:19.342 --> 17:20.387
Help me.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.044
[struggling]

18:03.256 --> 18:04.518
Go, go!

18:09.349 --> 18:10.785
[gasps]

18:44.384 --> 18:46.168
[Rus captain shouts]

18:46.212 --> 18:47.865
Guards! Guards!

18:47.909 --> 18:49.780
[guards shouting indistinctly]

18:58.659 --> 19:00.269
[bell ringing]

19:13.282 --> 19:15.154
[Ivar panting]

19:15.197 --> 19:17.591
-[Ivar] Psst! Take him!
Take him.
-[woman] Dir!

19:22.378 --> 19:24.511
[Dir breathing heavily]

19:36.218 --> 19:39.265
[Dir] This is not
the last time, Ivar Lothbrok.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.962
We shall meet again soon.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.401
But for now, good night.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.664
[Ivar] Good night.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.319
Go.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.408
[horse whinnies]

19:57.457 --> 19:59.720
[breathing heavily]

20:01.983 --> 20:04.028
Did we really do that?

20:04.072 --> 20:05.334
[laughs]

20:07.075 --> 20:08.076
Huh?

20:15.170 --> 20:16.693
[Oleg]
I want to show you these.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.131
I know you cannot read them

20:20.175 --> 20:21.829
but let me explain
what they are.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.223
These are legal documents,

20:24.266 --> 20:26.616
giving the Rus ancient
legal title

20:26.660 --> 20:28.966
to our Scandinavian homelands.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.449
So that our invasion
has legitimate cause.

20:33.493 --> 20:36.147
No. They are forgeries,
of course.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.672
But a forged title, my friend,

20:38.715 --> 20:40.413
is better than no title at all.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.632
-[servant speaks indistinctly]
-Oh, our food!

21:03.479 --> 21:05.002
Who are these?

21:05.046 --> 21:07.309
The guards who allowed
my brother to escape.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.443
We tortured them, of course.

21:11.618 --> 21:12.749
What did they say?

21:12.793 --> 21:14.795
[Oleg] They said...

21:14.838 --> 21:18.320
they were deliberately
distracted by a naked woman
and left their posts.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.497
They saw nothing else.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.109
And now they never will.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.511
I suppose you know nothing
about Dir's escape, do you?

21:38.514 --> 21:39.863
Igor?

21:40.516 --> 21:41.300
No.

21:47.697 --> 21:51.092
You understand that
with Dir free,
you are in more danger

21:51.135 --> 21:53.529
of being kidnapped than ever,

21:54.748 --> 21:56.184
hmm?

22:01.232 --> 22:03.365
Now I have a more
pleasant duty.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.237
I am to be married again.

22:08.065 --> 22:11.155
I want to introduce you
to my intended bride.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.245
This is Princess Katia.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.125
My dear Katia,
may I present to you

22:24.168 --> 22:27.520
my cousin and ward,
Prince Igor.

22:32.481 --> 22:33.439
[Katia] Prince.

22:33.482 --> 22:34.788
[kisses hand]

22:38.182 --> 22:41.360
And this is the Viking king
I told you about.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.231
This is Ivar.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.929
The famous Ivar the Boneless.

22:49.498 --> 22:50.978
Princess.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.068
King Ivar.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.376
Let's eat.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.206
You look as though
you have seen a ghost.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.602
Believe me, I have.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.650
[Oleg] Leave us.

23:10.693 --> 23:11.912
Please, enjoy your food.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.176
[indistinct chatter]

23:15.219 --> 23:16.438
[Lagertha]
Make sure it's tight.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.316
It has been a while, Lagertha.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.406
Perhaps they are not
coming back after all?

23:29.625 --> 23:30.974
I hope you're right.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.629
But you don't believe it.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.066
[Lagertha] No.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.764
I think they will come.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.594
[sighs]

23:42.725 --> 23:44.423
[indistinct chatter]

23:52.648 --> 23:57.218
Hmm. I want to consider it.
Yes, we'll talk.

23:57.261 --> 23:59.002
-[Harald laughs]
-[inaudible conversation]

24:02.005 --> 24:05.661
Ah, King Hakon.
Speaking of a warrior. Welcome.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.576
Good to see you here.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.491
Jarl Hrolf.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.449
Good to see you.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.989
[indistinct chatter]

24:40.957 --> 24:42.176
[guard] The gate!

24:49.618 --> 24:53.230
Move along! Move along!
Move along!

24:53.274 --> 24:54.797
Move along. Move along.

24:54.841 --> 24:58.497
Hurry up. Hurry.
Hurry up. Hurry up!

24:58.540 --> 25:00.237
Go! Go!

25:01.021 --> 25:02.718
[indistinct chatter]

25:31.660 --> 25:33.444
[crowd exclaiming]

25:36.752 --> 25:39.842
Princess.

25:39.886 --> 25:44.412
[sighs] I've been waiting
for the opportunity
to talk to you privately.

25:46.762 --> 25:50.592
Surely you understand why
I need to talk to you.

25:53.943 --> 25:57.338
Oleg is playing games with me.

25:57.381 --> 26:00.123
And why do you say so,
Ivar the Boneless?

26:00.167 --> 26:01.951
You are Freydis.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.605
Freydis?

26:03.649 --> 26:04.998
I don't understand.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.826
Neither do I.

26:06.869 --> 26:10.090
But it is true.
And you and I...

26:10.133 --> 26:11.570
were once married.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.442
Were we really?

26:15.356 --> 26:18.489
And what happened to us?

26:38.466 --> 26:39.641
[sighs]

26:42.731 --> 26:44.603
[hammering]

26:45.865 --> 26:47.040
[indistinct chatter]

27:00.836 --> 27:02.490
[coughing]

27:04.579 --> 27:05.667
Give me.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.409
How do you pay?

27:08.452 --> 27:10.803
You have not paid for days.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.892
I do not give for free.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.415
Give me.

27:17.723 --> 27:18.811
[sighs]

27:20.421 --> 27:21.814
Come on.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.467
You must pay.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.512
Later.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.166
I'll ask my brother, Ubbe.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.994
You know Ubbe, right?
You trust him?

27:28.037 --> 27:29.909
-Yes.
-Good.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.172
But I don't trust you.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.000
So, I give you nothing.

27:35.305 --> 27:39.527
[whispers]
Ale. And mushrooms. Now.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.877
[gasping]

27:41.921 --> 27:43.879
I'll take that.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.055
No.

27:46.099 --> 27:47.883
Then you get nothing.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.276
Only to suffer.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.285
[Hvitserk sniffs]

28:01.114 --> 28:02.506
Come on.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.347
More. More.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.046
[grunts]

28:37.193 --> 28:38.455
[tapping]

28:58.345 --> 29:01.087
[Seer in distorted voice]
If you came this way,

29:01.130 --> 29:03.089
taking any route,

29:03.132 --> 29:05.482
starting from anywhere,

29:05.526 --> 29:09.312
at any time or at any season,

29:09.356 --> 29:12.315
it would always be the same.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.361
[whispers] Is that really you?

29:14.404 --> 29:16.232
Could that be you, O Wise One?

29:16.276 --> 29:20.193
[Seer in distorted voice]
We are anyway
where we are supposed to be.

29:20.236 --> 29:21.803
I'm not supposed to be here.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.762
Not now, not here.

29:25.851 --> 29:29.115
I had things to do.
I had things to do.

29:29.158 --> 29:33.989
Perhaps what you thought
you came here for
is only a shell,

29:34.033 --> 29:37.688
a husk of meaning
from which the purpose breaks

29:37.732 --> 29:42.171
only when it is fulfilled,
if at all.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.826
Either you had no purpose

29:44.870 --> 29:50.527
or the purpose is beyond
the end you figured.

29:50.571 --> 29:52.573
[hesitantly]
I have a purpose. It's just...

29:54.314 --> 30:01.321
at this time, at this place,
I tend to forget.
I tend to forget.

30:02.670 --> 30:07.066
[Seer] Do not weep, Hvitserk,
son of Ragnar.

30:07.109 --> 30:11.940
There are other places
also at the world's end,

30:12.636 --> 30:15.248
some at the sea jaws,

30:15.291 --> 30:20.209
or over a dark lake,
in a desert or city.

30:20.253 --> 30:22.298
You're driving me mad!

30:22.342 --> 30:25.867
I drive you mad,
if it makes any difference...

30:25.911 --> 30:28.957
because you are not yet
fit for your purpose.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.960
Your life resembles death.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.745
[yelling] I am dead.

30:34.789 --> 30:39.881
No. Let me repeat,
so you can understand.

30:39.925 --> 30:47.671
Either you had no purpose
or the purpose is beyond
the end you figured.

30:47.715 --> 30:50.500
Altered in fulfillment.

30:50.544 --> 30:54.678
Altered in fulfillment,
Hvitserk.

30:55.592 --> 30:58.247
Altered in fulfillment.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.338
[mumbles]
Altered in fulfillment?

31:07.082 --> 31:08.867
[Hvitserk gasps]

31:12.218 --> 31:15.569
Altered in fulfillment?

31:17.571 --> 31:19.878
[indistinct mumbling]

31:20.966 --> 31:22.532
[indistinct chatter]

31:38.200 --> 31:41.160
[Kjetill] An amazing sight,
King Olaf.

31:41.203 --> 31:42.639
[Olaf] So it should be.

31:42.683 --> 31:46.513
For this is
an amazing occasion.

31:46.556 --> 31:52.388
Never before have we voted
for a king of all Norway.

31:54.173 --> 32:00.657
It's been a dream of many.
Now, now brought to fruition.

32:00.701 --> 32:03.095
I hope that things
will proceed smoothly.

32:06.141 --> 32:09.362
Do you know any reason
why it should not?

32:19.198 --> 32:21.200
[distant drumming]

32:21.243 --> 32:22.941
[crowd cheering]

32:53.972 --> 32:55.451
[Kjetill] Bjorn.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.063
What?

33:00.108 --> 33:01.327
Nothing.

33:01.370 --> 33:03.024
But may the gods be with you.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.338
[sighing]

33:16.081 --> 33:18.039
[drums beating]

34:04.259 --> 34:05.913
[rhythmic drumming]

34:19.274 --> 34:21.711
[indistinct drumming]

34:31.765 --> 34:36.161
Today is an extraordinary

34:37.162 --> 34:38.989
and a unique day

34:39.033 --> 34:44.256
in the history
and saga of our country.

34:44.299 --> 34:48.129
Never before have our rulers

34:48.173 --> 34:53.352
willingly gathered together
to elect one of their numbers

34:53.395 --> 34:56.398
as King of Kings.

34:56.442 --> 35:00.272
King of all Norway!

35:01.360 --> 35:06.365
Many have said that
such a thing is impossible!

35:06.408 --> 35:09.759
That our rulers
have never been able

35:09.803 --> 35:14.634
to see beyond
their own self-interest!

35:14.677 --> 35:17.593
Yet, now, with your own eyes,

35:17.637 --> 35:24.731
you will see the impossible
begin to happen!

35:24.774 --> 35:31.129
When all our votes
are cast into the sea,

35:31.172 --> 35:34.828
we will know
the identity of the man

35:34.871 --> 35:40.312
always fated to be the king
of all Norway!

35:42.444 --> 35:48.146
Each of these runes
represents an earl or a king.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.585
You shall know them
by their color.

35:53.455 --> 35:55.109
For example,

35:55.153 --> 36:00.158
Earl Thorkell
is represented by a blue rune.

36:01.811 --> 36:05.859
King Hakon by a green.

36:06.773 --> 36:10.951
Bjorn Ironside by a red.

36:10.994 --> 36:14.302
King Harald by a yellow.

36:14.346 --> 36:18.654
It falls to me
to cast the first vote.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.180
I vote...

36:23.268 --> 36:26.358
for Bjorn Ironside

36:27.402 --> 36:29.012
as king

36:29.796 --> 36:33.452
of all Norway!

36:33.495 --> 36:35.715
-[drums beating]
-[crowd cheering]

36:52.949 --> 36:54.995
[indistinct chatter]

37:21.848 --> 37:23.937
You are waiting for
someone to return?

37:27.549 --> 37:29.116
Yes.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.335
Your lover?

37:33.468 --> 37:35.253
Did he go with Bjorn?

37:37.342 --> 37:38.647
Yes.

37:39.692 --> 37:40.997
I know how you are feeling.

37:41.476 --> 37:42.912
You can't.

37:42.956 --> 37:46.002
You're the wife of Ubbe,
and I am a servant.

37:46.046 --> 37:47.526
Even if Bjorn survives--

37:47.569 --> 37:48.657
Bjorn?

37:50.180 --> 37:51.747
You are in love with Bjorn?

37:56.535 --> 37:58.885
Then, believe me, I do know.

38:00.408 --> 38:04.325
I stared out to sea and waited
for Bjorn many times.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.980
And each time he came back,
he was always further away.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.291
It will be different with me.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.163
Yes.

38:50.153 --> 38:51.546
And I...

38:53.635 --> 39:00.990
will also vote
for Bjorn Ironside to be
king of all Norway.

39:02.296 --> 39:03.819
[crowd cheering]

39:26.538 --> 39:27.626
Go on.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.584
We were traveling along
the Silk Road.

39:29.628 --> 39:32.805
We had gone many rost
and talked to many traders
from different countries,

39:32.848 --> 39:34.459
when we came
to the kingdom of Rus.

39:34.502 --> 39:37.157
I have heard of it.
It was founded by Rus Vikings.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.855
[envoy] Yes. Some of them
could still speak our language.

39:39.899 --> 39:43.511
We were invited into
one of their principal towns,
called Novgorod.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.426
Novgorod is a rich place,

39:45.470 --> 39:48.560
for these Rus are
very successful warriors,
hunters, and traders.

39:48.603 --> 39:50.475
And they were anxious
to do deals with us,

39:50.518 --> 39:52.999
for they said that
we have many things
which they wanted.

39:53.042 --> 39:54.783
[Torvi] But I don't understand.

39:54.827 --> 39:59.440
If you were so successful,
then why did you
come back so early?

39:59.484 --> 40:01.660
Surely your mission
is not yet concluded.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.618
[envoy] No.

40:03.662 --> 40:05.577
But we all felt that
someone should return
here at once.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.361
To report your success?

40:07.405 --> 40:10.408
[envoy] No.
To report something else.

40:10.451 --> 40:14.368
For while we were in Novgorod,
we learned that someone else
was staying with the Rus.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.326
Indeed, living at the palace

40:16.370 --> 40:20.243
in another town called Kiev
with their leader, Prince Oleg.

40:20.287 --> 40:21.549
Ivar?

40:21.593 --> 40:22.985
[envoy] Yes.

40:23.029 --> 40:25.205
They told us
that King Ivar the Boneless,

40:25.248 --> 40:28.556
son of Ragnar Lothbrok,
was their guest.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.821
You have done well
to bring us this news.

40:35.128 --> 40:39.088
I am not surprised
to hear that my little brother
is still alive.

40:40.525 --> 40:41.569
Go, and drink.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.353
[envoy] Thank you, Ubbe.

40:45.704 --> 40:46.966
What did you see?

40:53.233 --> 40:55.017
You must tell Hvitserk.

40:55.061 --> 40:57.280
For better or worse,
he needs to know.

40:59.979 --> 41:01.546
[man] Tighter!

41:02.590 --> 41:03.939
Hvitserk!

41:05.724 --> 41:07.377
Hvitserk!

41:30.313 --> 41:32.620
[Ivar in distorted voice]
I'm here, Brother!

41:33.708 --> 41:35.318
[rumbling]

41:39.888 --> 41:41.847
[whimpering]

41:52.814 --> 41:54.076
[panting]

41:56.601 --> 41:58.516
[Ivar in distorted voice]
Is it true?

41:58.559 --> 42:01.301
Did you jump ship
to be near me?

42:03.608 --> 42:05.000
[panting]

42:08.613 --> 42:10.615
[cracking]

42:13.052 --> 42:15.576
[Ivar in distorted voice] Not because you loved me.

42:16.969 --> 42:18.753
[Hvitserk whimpers]

42:18.797 --> 42:20.494
[sobbing]

42:20.538 --> 42:24.542
But because you needed to be close enough to kill me?

42:24.585 --> 42:26.282
[wood cracking]

42:36.902 --> 42:39.252
[Ivar laughs evilly]

42:42.037 --> 42:43.561
[hisses]

42:44.083 --> 42:46.651
[music playing]
