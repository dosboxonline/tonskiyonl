[Ragnar]
Previously onVikings...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.961
Hvitserk, if you like,
I will have him killed.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.571
No.

00:06.745 --> 00:07.964
We can elect a new ruler.
I intend to stand.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.922
I too intend to stand.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.621
You see? The way that Othere
always whispers
into Ubbe's ear.

00:12.795 --> 00:13.578
I worry about you, my dear.

00:13.752 --> 00:14.579
About me?

00:15.711 --> 00:16.929
[Asa screams]

00:17.104 --> 00:17.756
Jormungandr.

00:17.930 --> 00:18.975
Asa!

00:19.149 --> 00:20.716
No.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.457
He's come back.

00:22.631 --> 00:26.287
I was and I still am
the elected King of all Norway.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.985
Skane's men,
they just want to belong here.

00:29.159 --> 00:33.772
Between the three of us,
we will forge the future
of Kattegat.

00:33.946 --> 00:34.991
Prince Dir is ready.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.211
Today is Good Friday.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.734
Today you must do
everything we tell you.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.605
[grunting]

00:44.348 --> 00:45.697
Where is Prince Igor?

00:45.871 --> 00:47.656
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

02:04.428 --> 02:06.561
[crowd murmuring]

02:06.822 --> 02:08.215
Find Igor.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.265
[acolytes chanting
in Byzantine Greek]

02:15.439 --> 02:18.877
They came to a place
called Golgotha.

02:19.051 --> 02:22.490
They came to a place
called Golgotha.

02:22.664 --> 02:26.189
They came to a place
called Golgotha.

02:28.496 --> 02:31.151
[indistinct chatter]

02:37.635 --> 02:40.508
They came to a place
called Golgotha.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.267
[chanting continues]

03:21.375 --> 03:22.854
My brothers,

03:24.334 --> 03:26.467
I offer myself up for you.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.793
-[woman] It's me who told you.
-[man] Be quiet!

03:48.967 --> 03:50.230
[woman] Be quiet yourself.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.323
[gasps and groans]

03:58.150 --> 03:59.804
[man] Bless you.

04:05.810 --> 04:06.942

04:10.032 --> 04:11.555
[horse neighs]

04:14.558 --> 04:16.256
[crowd murmurs]

04:17.953 --> 04:19.476
[Igor] What do we do?

04:19.650 --> 04:20.999
Pray to the gods.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.525

[gasps]

05:18.666 --> 05:19.623
[grunts]

05:39.774 --> 05:41.906
[viking] Bail it out!
Come on!

05:43.473 --> 05:44.779
Torvi!

05:52.221 --> 05:53.048
Othere.

05:54.092 --> 05:54.963
Come and look.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.660
[breathing heavily]

05:58.227 --> 05:59.620
[Othere] What is it?

06:01.273 --> 06:04.494
Do you see? It's land.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.063
That must be it, hmm?

06:08.237 --> 06:10.239
That must be the golden land.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.939
Look! Land!

06:22.469 --> 06:24.253
[excited chatter]

06:39.050 --> 06:40.095
[exhales]

06:41.313 --> 06:43.838
[woman 1] Throw them out.

06:44.012 --> 06:47.058
[woman 2] Do you know what
the new place will be like?

06:47.232 --> 06:49.626
[chatter continues]

06:49.800 --> 06:50.975
[Harald] What are you doing?

06:55.197 --> 06:56.372
You don't have to leave here.

07:03.945 --> 07:07.339
Gunnhild, I know people
would have elected you.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.951
You would make a great Queen.

07:18.176 --> 07:21.049
Forgive me, Skane,
but these are personal matters.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.110
[chuckles softly]

07:41.548 --> 07:43.245
We should never
forget our past.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.726
Ever.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.338
We all live in the past,

07:49.512 --> 07:52.254
although some people
don't understand that.

07:57.433 --> 08:00.697
You and I and Bjorn,
we, uh...

08:01.742 --> 08:04.745
belong together.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.008
We danced around each other.
[chuckles]

08:09.793 --> 08:12.579
We hated
and we loved each other.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.278
I remember every time
I ever saw you,

08:18.280 --> 08:21.936
and I remember every time
I was in the company of Bjorn.

08:24.068 --> 08:27.071
Our sagas are one and the same.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.299
Bjorn died.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.302
I also died.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.612
But for some reason
I came back to life.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.359
You can't have Bjorn anymore.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.623
At least not
as a warm body
in your bed.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.106
[sighs] You can have me.

09:04.282 --> 09:05.762
And you can be
Queen of Kattegat.

09:06.937 --> 09:07.895
If I marry you?

09:12.377 --> 09:13.335
I ask in all humility,

09:14.728 --> 09:16.338
and I expect
no immediate answer.

09:33.747 --> 09:36.271
-Well...
-I lost Bjorn's child.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.148
I know.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.371
But you can
still have children.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.595
The past is never finished.

11:13.629 --> 11:18.242
Is this it?
Your golden land, Othere?

11:27.295 --> 11:28.688
[baby whines]

11:46.575 --> 11:49.491
[captain calls out]

11:52.320 --> 11:54.278

12:01.372 --> 12:04.158

Igor! Igor! Igor!

12:08.292 --> 12:09.685
[barking]

12:09.859 --> 12:11.513
[howls]

12:11.687 --> 12:12.949
[all laughing]

12:13.123 --> 12:15.038
I cannot express my joy
at your arrival.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.085
[crowd cheering]

12:18.259 --> 12:20.130
You are among friends
and finally where you belong!

12:20.304 --> 12:22.524
[cheering]

12:24.482 --> 12:26.615
King Ivar.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.661
I had no idea how you would
affect your escape from Kiev.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.799
I felt certain
that you would manage it.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.628
Tomorrow, we will plan
our attack on Kiev.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.544
The challenges are great,

12:43.458 --> 12:44.546
but we must act.

12:47.070 --> 12:49.769
So, in the meantime,
we prepare.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.163
Come.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.557
-Celebrate!
-[crowd cheering]

13:06.176 --> 13:08.700
I love you. Whoever you are.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.896
My beautiful, insatiable wife.

13:33.508 --> 13:34.726
My love.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.251
My heart.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.649
[kissing]

13:44.824 --> 13:48.349
It seems after all
that you were not alone
in betraying me.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.488
It has become a custom
among my wives.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.407
They run after everything,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.281
even cripples.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.894
What have I done wrong?

14:14.897 --> 14:18.640
Why has Our Lord abandoned me
and made me a figure of fun,

14:19.989 --> 14:21.817
a stupid cuckold?

14:29.999 --> 14:31.653
They will pay the price.

14:34.047 --> 14:37.180
You were very lucky,
I spared your suffering.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.663
But I will not spare them.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.754
They must suffer
beyond suffering.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.633
[indistinct chatter]

15:00.682 --> 15:02.771
This is not the land
that you described. [grunts]

15:03.815 --> 15:05.339
Forests and valleys?

15:05.513 --> 15:07.254
[Ingvild] The golden sands.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.083
The sound of birdsong
on the sweet air.

15:10.257 --> 15:14.087
Maybe he never saw such things.
Maybe he just dreamed them.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.872
-[man shouting]
-[all clamoring]

15:18.874 --> 15:20.093
[man] You misguiding dog.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.008
Maybe we should
just let Othere speak.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.665
As far as I can see,

15:27.839 --> 15:30.712
this is not
the land I glimpsed
all those years ago.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.496
-[man] You lied!
-[woman] Everything from
your mouth is lies!

15:32.670 --> 15:33.715
[Othere] How do I know
where we are?

15:35.282 --> 15:36.631
I was not lying.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.940
I saw what I saw.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.943
What possible motive
would I have to lie to you?

15:44.117 --> 15:47.163
-[woman] You tricked us all!
-[crowd shouting]

15:49.078 --> 15:51.863
-I don't accuse Othere.
-[clamor stops]

15:52.038 --> 15:55.432
Very well, this is not
the golden land
that we dreamed of,

15:55.606 --> 15:59.567
but it is still land.
And very possibly free land.

15:59.741 --> 16:03.092
Now, we as farmers,
we know the value of land, huh?

16:03.266 --> 16:05.094
Especially if we don't have
to pay for it.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.705
We should claim this land

16:07.879 --> 16:10.273
and establish a colony here.

16:10.447 --> 16:13.798
For it seems to me
the gods sent us here
for a purpose.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.801
I agree with Ketill.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.240
We do not know anything
about this land yet.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.374
We should send out
an exploratory party,

16:24.548 --> 16:27.334
see what we can discover
about this new place,

16:27.508 --> 16:30.598
the other inhabitants,
maybe even a food source.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.166
Yes. Otherwise,
we will all be dead.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.429
[crowd clamoring]

16:57.712 --> 16:58.887
You thinking about Asa?

17:03.326 --> 17:04.545
It was my fault.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.070
It was not your fault.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.900
It was fated to happen
and that's the end of it.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.474
You don't want
to talk about it?

17:22.519 --> 17:23.738
No.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.134
We will talk no more of Asa.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.616
[Torvi sniffles]

17:41.016 --> 17:43.540
-[baby gurgling]
-[sniffling]

17:48.937 --> 17:50.939
[indistinct chatter]

18:34.025 --> 18:35.331
[sniffs]

18:53.654 --> 18:55.003
Why do you live here, Ingrid?

18:57.048 --> 18:59.486
I don't feel comfortable
at the Great Hall
with Gunnhild.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.053
It doesn't seem right.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.186
Hmm.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.929
But you wanted to be Queen?

19:11.324 --> 19:13.717
The food is ready.
Please sit down.

19:16.416 --> 19:17.678
[chuckles softly]

19:30.865 --> 19:32.083
[groans]

19:34.347 --> 19:35.957
You haven't answered
my question.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.090
Do you want some ale?

19:41.789 --> 19:43.225
Why did you want to be Queen?

19:52.234 --> 19:53.888
Because I'm carrying
Bjorn's child.

20:10.165 --> 20:11.688
[Ingrid gasps]

20:14.909 --> 20:18.129
But it's not
Bjorn's child, is it?

20:21.655 --> 20:25.702
You know it's not.
It's our child.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.014
And what is this? Hmm?

20:34.581 --> 20:35.756
Huh?

20:37.714 --> 20:39.107
You're a witch?

20:41.283 --> 20:47.028
Then this, this is either
a love potion or it's poison.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.726
Go on, pour it down, then.

20:50.988 --> 20:52.468
Pour it in.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.950
Pour it all in. Do as I say!

21:18.364 --> 21:20.191
[cup clatters]

21:20.366 --> 21:21.715
[Harald exhales]

21:26.502 --> 21:28.504
[indistinct chatter]

21:33.596 --> 21:34.510
[grunts]

21:42.605 --> 21:44.607
My Lord. It is done.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.132
Prince

21:58.795 --> 22:01.102
I have called
you all to council

22:01.276 --> 22:04.932
because, as you have heard,
my ward, Prince Igor,

22:05.106 --> 22:07.151
has been kidnapped
by Ivar the Boneless

22:07.326 --> 22:08.762
and his brother Hvitserk.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.157
And that my wife
is also missing.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.117
[murmuring]

22:19.512 --> 22:22.689
I have firm information
that Ivar has joined forces

22:22.863 --> 22:25.213
with my brother Dir
in Novgorod.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.303
We have no choice
but to prepare for an attack.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.653
We will repel Dir's attack

22:30.827 --> 22:33.961
and then make counterattacks,
to devastating effect!

22:34.135 --> 22:36.485
[indecisive murmuring]

22:45.146 --> 22:46.495
I am the Prophet.

22:51.239 --> 22:55.112
And I can tell you
that our victory is assured.

22:55.286 --> 22:59.160
My brother Dir
will fall from the balcony
of this palace,

22:59.334 --> 23:01.162
struck in the chest by an arrow

23:01.336 --> 23:03.294
fired by Prince Igor,

23:03.469 --> 23:04.687
heir to the throne

23:04.861 --> 23:06.341
and my beloved nephew.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.173
Hail Igor!

23:13.261 --> 23:14.784
Hail Igor!

23:14.958 --> 23:18.919
[all] Hail Igor!
Hail Igor! Hail Igor!

23:19.093 --> 23:21.400
Hail Igor!

23:37.067 --> 23:38.895
[sighs]

23:44.510 --> 23:47.295
Skogarmaor. Sit

23:51.430 --> 23:53.649
[Erik] Why do you
still call me that?

23:55.782 --> 23:59.133
[Harald scoffs]
Because it's true.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.617
I know all about you.

24:04.791 --> 24:07.271
I know who and what
you really are,

24:08.795 --> 24:10.797
and I'm sure
no one else does.

24:12.538 --> 24:16.498
[Erik] You know what you know.
I'm different now.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.720
Of course. Aren't we all?

24:24.985 --> 24:26.029
What is it you want?

24:28.292 --> 24:29.250
Do you want to stay here?

24:30.773 --> 24:32.993
I like being an outsider.

24:33.167 --> 24:35.430
You trafficked
slaves illegally.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.825
You killed people
in futile property quarrels,

24:38.999 --> 24:40.740
not once but twice.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.916
And you were expelled
from two kingdoms.

24:43.090 --> 24:44.395
I've changed.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.355
[yells] Into what?
What is it you want?

24:49.575 --> 24:50.793
[Harald exhales]

24:54.014 --> 24:55.232
[clicks tongue]

24:59.454 --> 25:00.934
[Harald sighs]

25:01.108 --> 25:04.328
I have to appoint
a new head of my body guard.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.593
Skane's ambitious.
I'm not sure I trust him.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.076
I wondered if you would
accept the position.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.221
[indistinct chatter]

25:28.439 --> 25:29.440
[woman] Ketill.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.270
Oh, Ketill.

25:35.098 --> 25:38.275
-Well?
-We traveled many rost.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.842
It is indeed a strange land.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.672
It is a strange land.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.980
We saw no signs
of other humans.

25:47.154 --> 25:50.070
No animal or wildlife,
no trees or minerals,

25:50.244 --> 25:51.550
except in the sea.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.421
Which is also full
of driftwood,

25:53.595 --> 25:55.379
from where we know not.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.904
Nevertheless,
if the conditions in Iceland

25:58.078 --> 26:01.124
are anything to go by,
I believe that our prospects

26:01.298 --> 26:03.518
and the weather here
will improve very soon, huh?

26:03.692 --> 26:05.999
Then we should try
and settle this empty land.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.261
This land?

26:07.435 --> 26:09.263
[murmurs]

26:14.921 --> 26:18.054
I agree. So, I suggest
that our next move

26:18.228 --> 26:22.232
be to parcel up the land
equally and fairly
between all of the families.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.583
All of you must spread out
and decide for yourselves

26:24.757 --> 26:27.063
where it is that
you want to build a farm.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.543
But we cannot farm.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.371
There will be
hardships for sure.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.375
But we are hardy people,
are we not?

26:34.549 --> 26:37.508
What are we going
to call this land?

26:37.683 --> 26:41.034
Well, since there are no trees,
why don't we call it Greenland?

26:41.208 --> 26:42.513
[all laughing]

26:42.688 --> 26:44.515
How will we attract
new settlers, huh?

26:44.690 --> 26:45.995
[all laughing]

26:46.169 --> 26:47.823
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Ketill laughs]

26:55.744 --> 26:57.311
[sighs]

27:13.719 --> 27:14.720
[Ubbe] I believe you.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.114
This is not the land
that you saw.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.116
[Othere] No.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.511
Thank you.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.432
[sighs]

27:35.523 --> 27:37.917
[indistinct chatter]

27:41.442 --> 27:42.443
[Skane] Erik.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.366
What do you want?

27:52.540 --> 27:54.020
I don't waste words.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.631
Harald's coronation is soon
and I don't trust him.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.503
And he doesn't trust you.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.681
So, let's kill him

28:02.855 --> 28:04.378
and crown you instead.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.120
What do you say?

28:33.537 --> 28:35.496
[people chattering]

28:47.073 --> 28:49.553
How are we to survive, Ubbe?

28:56.647 --> 28:57.692
I don't know.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.000
We'll just have to.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.876
When the weather
finally improves,

29:08.050 --> 29:10.096
we will have a choice.

29:10.270 --> 29:14.840
We can sail back to Iceland
or we can sail west again,

29:16.493 --> 29:18.452
try and find
Othere's golden land.

29:19.670 --> 29:20.846
You still believe it exists?

29:22.673 --> 29:25.633
You still... trust Othere?

29:27.635 --> 29:30.551
The truth is, Torvi,
I have to find that land.

29:30.725 --> 29:33.554
Otherwise, my life,
it is filled with no meaning.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.515
I would rather die
trying to find that land

29:38.689 --> 29:40.561
than return to Iceland
a failure,

29:42.041 --> 29:44.565
doubting myself,
doubting the gods.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.105
[Harald moans]

30:11.592 --> 30:12.593
[sighs]

30:14.551 --> 30:16.510
They have the crown?

30:16.684 --> 30:19.992
-[servant] Yes, my Lord Harald.
-Good.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.733
It didn't belong
to Bjorn in any case.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.039
[servant] No, my Lord Harald.

30:25.562 --> 30:29.697
No. Good.
Then everything is ready.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.661
-It's finished.
-It's good.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.278
[servant 2] My Lord Harald.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.195
Let her in.

30:55.941 --> 30:56.942
What?

30:58.769 --> 31:00.380
[softly] Gunnhild
wants to see you.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.512
Now?

31:02.686 --> 31:05.211
-Before the coronation?
-Yes. I'll take you there.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.954
[indistinct chatter]

31:34.022 --> 31:37.547
-Are you sure?
-Yes, my Lord Harald.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.114
Gunnhild is in here?

31:39.288 --> 31:42.161
Yes, my Lord, I swear.
This is the place.

31:44.990 --> 31:45.991
Gunnhild is waiting.

31:47.557 --> 31:48.950
[snickers]

31:50.865 --> 31:51.822
Women.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.264
Gunnhild?

31:59.787 --> 32:00.701
[grunts]

32:03.182 --> 32:07.621
No. Not Gunnhild.
It's me, Skane.

32:07.795 --> 32:08.709
Here is your death.

32:11.712 --> 32:12.626
[chuckles]

32:12.800 --> 32:13.888
The King is dead.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.717
[breathing heavily]

32:16.891 --> 32:17.761
Long live the King.

32:26.031 --> 32:26.814
[thudding]

32:28.033 --> 32:29.208
[gasping]

32:37.303 --> 32:38.826
[laughs]

32:39.000 --> 32:40.784
Skogarmaor!

32:47.182 --> 32:50.229
[Erik] In sight
of all these people
gathered freely together,

32:52.057 --> 32:55.843
and in sight
of the Aesir and Vanir,

32:56.017 --> 33:01.892
I crown you King of Kattegat
and of all Norway.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.547
May the gods love and keep you.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.767
[crowd cheering]

33:15.602 --> 33:19.954
I appoint this man
as the head of my body guard.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.304
[crowd cheering]

33:22.478 --> 33:25.742
I want to make it known
that it is my intention

33:25.916 --> 33:30.791
to marry the beautiful
and the beloved Gunnhild,

33:32.140 --> 33:33.707
and to make her my Queen!

33:33.881 --> 33:37.058
[crowd cheering]

33:37.232 --> 33:41.454
And it is also my intention
to marry the woman
called Ingrid,

33:41.628 --> 33:43.891
who will also be my Queen!

33:44.065 --> 33:45.719
[crowd cheering]

33:47.721 --> 33:50.593
And now, let us all celebrate!

33:50.767 --> 33:52.465
[crowd cheering]

33:54.119 --> 33:55.903
[man] Ingrid, our Queen!

34:16.054 --> 34:16.880
Prince.

34:22.886 --> 34:26.064
I've been wanting
to speak to you
for a few days now.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.675
But whenever I feel ready
to speak to you,

34:28.849 --> 34:30.329
I become afraid.

34:35.595 --> 34:36.552
Afraid?

34:41.470 --> 34:43.124
Yes.

34:43.298 --> 34:45.431
No one in this world
has ever done for me

34:45.605 --> 34:47.824
what you have done for me.

34:47.998 --> 34:51.915
I know everything now.
I know I was Oleg's puppet.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.222
I know I was abused by Oleg.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.879
But you were always my friend.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.013
You have to understand
that I was your friend

35:03.188 --> 35:05.712
because I needed you to help me
escape from your uncle.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.541
But still, no one
has ever cared for me

35:08.715 --> 35:10.020
the way you have cared for me.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.895
I think you saw something
of yourself in me.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.029
I was a cripple too.

35:21.075 --> 35:24.122
I was so damaged,
I wanted to die.

35:26.036 --> 35:26.907
[sighs]

35:29.170 --> 35:30.345
You saved me.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.394
You have been everything to me,
Ivar the Boneless.

35:38.310 --> 35:41.661
I love you. And I always will.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.021
[kisses]

35:58.765 --> 36:00.723
[horse passing by]

36:03.335 --> 36:05.902
I just want the truth.

36:06.076 --> 36:07.948
I don't care how much
the truth hurts anymore.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.993
I am beyond that.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.953
Are you absolutely certain that
you are carrying Bjorn's child?

36:20.700 --> 36:23.442
No. Of course not.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.229
You know King Harald raped me.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.711
I don't understand.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.017
How can you possibly
contemplate marrying
King Harald

36:34.192 --> 36:35.976
after what he did to you?

36:36.150 --> 36:37.673
You know perfectly well why.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.549
Look at it from my position.

36:43.723 --> 36:47.074
I am not a shield-maiden
like you, or Lagertha.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.337
I have no advantages,

36:49.511 --> 36:51.121
no way of making
my life better,

36:52.993 --> 36:55.909
except for using my wits
and my sex.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.043
Can you blame me?

37:09.357 --> 37:10.750
[thunder rumbling]

37:12.230 --> 37:15.189
[snoring]

37:15.363 --> 37:18.671
-[thunder crashes]
-[Seer] Thunder but no rain.

37:18.845 --> 37:22.457
Dry, sterile thunder
without rain.

37:22.631 --> 37:26.069
Ice, but no water.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.028
A sterile land.

37:29.116 --> 37:31.118
A godless land.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.034
Unreal.

37:40.214 --> 37:42.999
The gods must be here.

37:43.173 --> 37:48.614
[Seer] They avoided this place,
between one world and another.

37:48.788 --> 37:53.401
I have roamed far
and learned much.

37:53.575 --> 37:57.710
This blasted place,
without solace,

37:57.884 --> 38:00.365
without even ghosts.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.192
[thunder rumbling]

38:05.239 --> 38:06.414
The gods are everywhere.

38:09.025 --> 38:12.377
All that the gods know, I know.

38:12.551 --> 38:14.117
We should leave this place.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.554
[Seer] If you can.

38:16.642 --> 38:19.166
But listen to the thunder.

38:19.340 --> 38:23.431
He who was living is now dead.

38:23.605 --> 38:27.740
We who were living
are now dying.

38:29.132 --> 38:32.222
Ragnar? Do you mean Ragnar?

38:32.397 --> 38:36.357
I mean all of us. We are dying.

38:36.531 --> 38:40.230
And this is not a place
we found by mistake.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.929
This is not a place at all.

38:43.103 --> 38:45.845
It is a state of the soul.

38:46.019 --> 38:48.456
Don't you see, son of Ragnar?

38:48.630 --> 38:51.981
Or are you as blind
as all the rest?

38:55.898 --> 38:57.204
No, stay with me.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.076
Stay with me, wise one.

39:01.469 --> 39:02.905
Comfort me.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.873
[crow cawing]

39:29.454 --> 39:30.324
My darling Bjorn.

39:33.196 --> 39:36.461
My love. My heart.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.507
My husband.

39:49.299 --> 39:50.431
I come to praise you...

39:54.304 --> 39:56.350
and speak to you as my husband.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.052
I am under pressure
to marry King Harald.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.187
It seems the only way
to retain my status.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.191
I am a woman.

40:13.498 --> 40:14.716
If I do not marry him,

40:16.370 --> 40:17.893
then I am nothing again.

40:21.157 --> 40:23.421
The time of great heroes
is over, Bjorn.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.427
We lost Ragnar,

40:33.256 --> 40:34.519
we lost Lagertha,

40:37.870 --> 40:39.219
and we lost you.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.266
Perhaps...

40:45.355 --> 40:48.228
Perhaps the Golden Age
of the Vikings is gone.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.450
It's over.

40:54.974 --> 40:57.759
Lesser men
have taken your place.

40:57.933 --> 41:00.501
Harald, Erik, and others.

41:04.549 --> 41:05.941
Whatever happens,

41:07.116 --> 41:09.249
I will not compromise myself.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.253
I will not compromise you.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.000
I will do the right thing.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.223
[Frodi] Father!

41:27.397 --> 41:28.486
[woman] What is it?

41:28.660 --> 41:31.271
[Frodi] Come! Father!

41:33.360 --> 41:35.971
Father! Come!

41:38.496 --> 41:42.282
Father! Father! Come! Quickly!

41:52.510 --> 41:53.815
Father!

42:01.170 --> 42:02.302
Come!

42:07.263 --> 42:08.874
[murmuring]

42:19.667 --> 42:23.323
O Lord, you have come among us.

42:34.900 --> 42:35.901
[Frodi] Look!

42:40.645 --> 42:41.863
Father, look.

42:43.822 --> 42:45.519
[indistinct chatter]

42:45.693 --> 42:48.870
O Lord, you have come here.
Come to deliver us.

42:51.307 --> 42:52.831
Lord, have mercy.

42:54.484 --> 42:56.095
Lord, you are here.

43:02.971 --> 43:04.364
Christ, the Deliverer.

43:10.936 --> 43:12.633
People, as you can see,

43:12.807 --> 43:15.375
the whale has washed up
on my property.

43:15.549 --> 43:20.554
Look for yourselves,
it's true. It's our whale.

43:20.728 --> 43:23.209
[Ubbe] But surely
you mean to share it?

43:23.383 --> 43:25.733
You don't need
the whole animal, hmm?

43:25.907 --> 43:29.563
There's enough food and fuel
for the entire settlement.

43:29.737 --> 43:31.696
I will have to discuss that
with my family.

43:33.872 --> 43:36.439
All I'm saying, at the moment,

43:36.614 --> 43:39.355
legally, the whale
belongs to me.

43:39.529 --> 43:42.445
If anyone can prove otherwise,
let them say so!

43:44.230 --> 43:46.580
[Ubbe] I'm surprised
at you, Ketill.

43:46.754 --> 43:49.061
I thought we were
all in this together, no?

43:49.235 --> 43:51.193
Listen, Ubbe,
you see how it is.

43:52.804 --> 43:54.544
The gods,
they make their decisions.

43:54.719 --> 43:56.851
The gods decide.

43:57.025 --> 43:58.244
There has to be some reason

43:58.418 --> 43:59.898
the whale beached
on my property.

44:00.550 --> 44:02.117
It's called luck.

44:03.728 --> 44:06.078
There's no such thing,
as well you know.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.652
[music playing]
