WEBVTT

00:53.054 --> 00:54.430
It's alive.

00:54.514 --> 00:57.809
It's alive. it's alive!

01:13.283 --> 01:15.702
There he is!
Hit it again!

01:25.503 --> 01:26.754
Success!

01:27.589 --> 01:29.424
Count, it's just you.

01:29.799 --> 01:33.052
I was beginning to
lose faith, Victor.

01:35.722 --> 01:39.017
A pity your moment of
triumph is being spoiled

01:39.100 --> 01:41.603
over a little thing
like grave robbery.

01:41.686 --> 01:43.104
Yes.

01:44.063 --> 01:46.024
I must escape this place.

01:46.316 --> 01:48.818
Where are you going
to run, Victor?

01:50.194 --> 01:54.699
Your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome

01:54.782 --> 01:57.201
in most of the civilized world.

01:57.327 --> 02:01.122
I'll take him away, far away,
where no one will ever find him.

02:01.414 --> 02:02.999
No, Victor.

02:03.082 --> 02:06.461
The time has come for me
to take command of him.

02:07.378 --> 02:08.795
What are you saying?

02:08.880 --> 02:11.758
Why do you think I brought you here?
Gave you this castle?

02:11.841 --> 02:13.134
Equipped your laboratory?

02:13.217 --> 02:14.552
You said...

02:15.053 --> 02:17.138
You said you
believed in my work.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.723
And I do.

02:19.223 --> 02:23.645
But now that it is,
as you yourself have said,

02:23.728 --> 02:27.273
a triumph of science

02:27.982 --> 02:29.609
over God,

02:32.528 --> 02:36.115
it must now serve my purpose.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.329
What purpose?

02:53.966 --> 02:55.259
Good God!

02:55.968 --> 02:59.180
I would kill myself before
helping in such a task.

02:59.597 --> 03:02.934
Feel free. I don't actually
need you anymore, Victor.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.811
I just need him.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.188
He is the key.

03:08.022 --> 03:11.192
I could never allow him
to be used for such evil.

03:11.693 --> 03:12.944
I could.

03:13.778 --> 03:16.864
In fact, my brides
are insisting upon it.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.537
Igor, help me!

03:22.620 --> 03:25.665
You have been
so kind to me, Doctor,

03:26.165 --> 03:28.459
caring, thoughtful.

03:28.626 --> 03:31.170
But he pays me.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.551
Stay back.

03:36.718 --> 03:39.178
You can't kill me, Victor.

03:42.890 --> 03:43.891
Ah!

03:45.810 --> 03:47.478
I'm already dead.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.870
Dr. Frankenstein!

04:48.623 --> 04:50.875
Look, it's headed
for the windmill!

04:50.958 --> 04:52.543
Come on!

05:35.962 --> 05:38.756
Burn it!
Burn it down!

06:09.954 --> 06:11.956
Why?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.928
Why?

06:44.322 --> 06:45.615
Vampires.

06:45.823 --> 06:46.908
Run for your lives!

06:47.033 --> 06:48.492
Vampires!

07:09.722 --> 07:10.973
Father.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.486
Evening.

09:28.819 --> 09:32.698
You're a big one.
You'll be hard to digest.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.327
I'd hate to be such a nuisance.

09:44.335 --> 09:46.420
I missed you in London.

09:46.504 --> 09:50.341
No, you bloody did
not! You got me good.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.219
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted by the
Knights of the Holy Order...

09:53.302 --> 09:54.595
it's Mr. Hyde now.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.431
...for the murder of
12 men, six women, four...

09:57.515 --> 10:02.436
Children, three goats, and a
rather nasty massacre of poultry!

10:03.187 --> 10:06.732
So you're
the great Van Helsing.

10:06.816 --> 10:09.026
And you're
a deranged psychopath.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.493
We all have our
little problems.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.206
My superiors would like
for me to take you alive

10:22.289 --> 10:24.875
so that they may extricate
your better half.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.503
I bet they bloody would.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.423
Personally, I'd rather just
kill you and call it a day.

10:31.549 --> 10:34.051
But let's make it your
decision, shall we?

10:34.385 --> 10:35.636
Do let's.

10:57.575 --> 10:59.952
Here I come,

11:00.035 --> 11:02.288
ready or not!

11:05.916 --> 11:08.002
The bell!

11:37.031 --> 11:38.949
No, no.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.120
I'll bet that's upsetting.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.383
Paris!

11:59.887 --> 12:01.472
Come here.

12:03.682 --> 12:08.520
I think you'll find the view
over here rather spectacular.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.069
It's been
a pleasure knowing you.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.612
Au revoir!

12:37.174 --> 12:38.342
Oh, no.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.018
My turn.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.211
May he rest in peace.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.063
Van Helsing.

13:33.731 --> 13:36.233
You murderer!

14:03.677 --> 14:04.928
Bless me, Father, for I have...

14:05.012 --> 14:08.682
Sinned. Yes, I know.
You're very good at that.

14:08.766 --> 14:10.726
You shattered the Rose Window.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.562
Not to split hairs, sir, but Mr.
Hyde did the shattering.

14:13.645 --> 14:17.274
13th century.
Over 600 years old.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.361
I wish you a week
in hell for that.

14:20.486 --> 14:22.196
It would be a nice reprieve.

14:22.279 --> 14:25.699
Don't get me wrong.
Your results are unquestionable

14:25.866 --> 14:28.952
but your methods attract
far too much attention.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.122
"Wanted" posters?
We are not pleased.

14:32.206 --> 14:34.375
Do you think I like being the
most wanted man in Europe?

14:34.458 --> 14:37.169
Why don't you and the Order
do something about it?

14:37.252 --> 14:39.421
Because we do not exist.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.340
Well, then neither do I.

14:45.177 --> 14:49.139
When we found you crawling up the
steps of this church, half-dead,

14:49.223 --> 14:52.726
it was clear to all of us that you
had been sent to do God's work.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.144
Why can't he do it himself?

14:54.228 --> 14:55.479
Don't blaspheme.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.191
You already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.735
If you wish to recover it

15:01.819 --> 15:04.738
I suggest you continue
to heed the call.

15:06.407 --> 15:09.243
Without us, the world
would be in darkness.

15:09.368 --> 15:12.496
Governments and
empires come and go

15:12.579 --> 15:17.167
but we have kept mankind
safe since time immemorial.

15:17.543 --> 15:20.045
We are the last
defense against evil.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.590
An evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists.

15:23.674 --> 15:28.262
To you, these monsters are just
evil beings to be vanquished.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.932
I'm the one standing
there when they die

15:32.015 --> 15:33.851
and become
the men they once were.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.479
For you, my good son, this
is all a test of faith.

15:37.896 --> 15:41.442
And now, we need
you to go to the East.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.695
To the far side of Romania.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.114
An accursed land

15:47.197 --> 15:50.200
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.620
Lorded over by
a certain Count Dracula.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.247
Dracula?

15:55.330 --> 15:56.373
Yes.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.418
You've never faced
one like this before.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.797
Our story begins 450 years ago

16:03.881 --> 16:07.634
when a Transylvanian knight,
named Valerious the Elder,

16:07.718 --> 16:11.221
promised God that his family would
never rest nor enter heaven

16:11.305 --> 16:14.349
until they vanquished
Dracula from their land.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.852
They have not succeeded

16:17.436 --> 16:19.980
and they are
running out of family.

16:20.898 --> 16:25.194
His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.905
He disappeared
almost 12 months ago.

16:29.448 --> 16:34.328
His only son, Prince Velkan, and
his daughter, Princess Anna.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.956
If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished,

16:38.040 --> 16:42.794
nine generations of their family will
never enter the gates of St. Peter.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.339
For more than four centuries

16:45.422 --> 16:48.008
this family has
defended our left flank.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.927
They gave their lives.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.514
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.933
So you're sending me into hell.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.561
In a manner.

17:02.564 --> 17:06.276
Valerious the Elder left
this here 400 years ago.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.694
We don't know its purpose

17:08.779 --> 17:11.365
but he would not
have left it lightly.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.076
The Latin inscription
translates as,

17:14.617 --> 17:17.663
"In the name of God,
open this door."

17:18.497 --> 17:20.290
There is an insignia.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.005
Yes, it matches your ring.

17:27.923 --> 17:32.177
I think that in Transylvania you
may find the answer you seek.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.562
Faster, please.
Faster!

17:46.149 --> 17:47.150
Getting there.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.235
Carl!

17:48.318 --> 17:49.361
There you are.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.281
Did you bring Mr.
Hyde back, or did you kill him?

17:52.364 --> 17:53.699
You killed him, didn't you?

17:53.782 --> 17:55.409
That's why they get so annoyed.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.910
When they ask you to
bring someone back,

17:56.994 --> 17:58.745
they don't mean as a corpse.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.414
All right, you're
in a mood. Come on.

18:00.497 --> 18:03.250
I have some things that'll put
the bit back in your mouth.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.460
Any idiot can make a sword.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.462
Sorry, Father.

18:07.546 --> 18:08.589
Come along, Carl.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.424
Here, take this.

18:10.841 --> 18:14.344
Rings of garlic, holy water,

18:16.680 --> 18:19.725
silver stake, crucifix.

18:22.686 --> 18:25.063
Why can't I have one of those?

18:25.147 --> 18:27.608
You've never gone after
vampires before now, have you?

18:27.691 --> 18:29.985
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.069
Best when cooked well.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.446
No, they're not all the same.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.489
A vampire is
nothing like a Warlock.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.074
My granny could kill a Warlock.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.243
Carl, you've never even
been out of the abbey.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.745
How do you know about vampires?

18:39.828 --> 18:41.496
I read.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.874
Here's something new.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.543
Glycerin 48.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.842
Sorry!

18:54.384 --> 18:56.303
What in the name of
Allah is wrong with you?

18:56.386 --> 18:58.555
The air around here
is thick with envy.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.516
This is my latest invention.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.976
It's gas-propelled.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.354
Capable of catapulting
arrows in rapid succession

19:05.437 --> 19:06.897
at tremendous velocity.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.066
Just pull
the trigger and hold on.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.902
I've heard the stories
from Transylvania.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.320
Trust me, you'll need this.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.988
A work of certifiable genius.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.406
If you don't say so yourself.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.200
No, I did say so myself.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.160
I'm a veritable
cornucopia of talent.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.745
Did you invent this?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.664
I've been working
on that for 12 years.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.582
It's compressed
magma from Mt. Vesuvius

19:25.666 --> 19:27.709
with pure alkaline
from the Gobi Desert.

19:27.793 --> 19:28.835
It's one of a kind.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.253
What's it for?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.673
I don't know, but I'm
sure it'll come in handy.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.883
12 years, and you
don't know what it does?

19:34.966 --> 19:37.678
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't know what it's for.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.138
What it does is to
create a light source

19:40.222 --> 19:41.848
equal to
the intensity of the sun.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.517
This will come in handy how?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.852
I don't know.
You can blind your enemies.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.146
Charbroil a herd of
charging wildebeest.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.690
Use your imagination.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.274
No, I'm gonna use yours.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.567
That's why
you're coming with me.

19:52.651 --> 19:54.027
Holy hell be damned that I am!

19:54.111 --> 19:55.112
You cursed.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.240
Not very well, but you're a monk.
You shouldn't curse at all.

19:58.323 --> 20:01.868
Actually, I'm still just a friar.
I can curse all I want,

20:01.952 --> 20:03.161
damn it!

20:03.245 --> 20:06.248
The Cardinal has ordered
you to keep me alive.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.542
For as long as possible.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.460
But I'm not a field man.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.131
I don't want to
go to Transylvania.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.673
Come on.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.177
Dracula unleashed
you for a reason.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.076
Pull me up!

21:25.160 --> 21:26.536
It's stuck!

21:34.878 --> 21:36.463
No, Anna, it will kill you!

21:36.546 --> 21:38.089
That's my brother out there.

21:40.842 --> 21:43.053
Cut the rope! Cut it now!

21:56.817 --> 21:58.026
Velkan!

22:08.912 --> 22:10.789
My gun! Find my gun!

22:10.872 --> 22:12.165
Find Velkan's gun.

22:12.249 --> 22:13.875
It has to be
the silver bullets.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.631
Anna, hurry!

22:22.509 --> 22:23.635
Move.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.097
Anna, look out!

22:29.432 --> 22:30.600
Run!

23:00.714 --> 23:02.132
Velkan.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.471
God

23:10.515 --> 23:11.808
help us.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.048
So, what do you remember?

24:25.131 --> 24:26.716
Not now, Carl.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.635
There must be something.

24:29.260 --> 24:32.013
I remember fighting
the Romans at Masada.

24:32.430 --> 24:33.640
That was in 73 A.D.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.058
You asked.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.479
What are we doing here?

24:39.562 --> 24:41.898
Why is it so important to
kill this Dracula, anyway?

24:41.982 --> 24:43.817
Because he's
the son of the Devil.

24:43.900 --> 24:44.985
I mean, besides that.

24:45.068 --> 24:48.405
If we kill him, anything bitten
or created by him will also die.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.489
I mean, besides that.

24:49.572 --> 24:52.367
Welcome to Transylvania.

25:04.004 --> 25:05.547
Is it always like this?

25:05.630 --> 25:06.923
Pretty much.

25:08.299 --> 25:09.926
You, turn around.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.932
Let me see your faces.
Why?

25:16.016 --> 25:18.309
Because we don't
trust strangers.

25:18.393 --> 25:20.687
Strangers don't last long here.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.481
5'7" by 2'3"

25:25.275 --> 25:27.777
Gentlemen, you will
now be disarmed.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.238
You can try.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.286
You refuse to obey our laws?

25:36.494 --> 25:38.246
The laws of men
mean little to me.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.206
Fine.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.416
Kill them.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.709
I'm here to help you.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.377
I don't need any help.

25:44.461 --> 25:45.670
Really?

26:01.561 --> 26:04.481
Everybody inside!

26:04.856 --> 26:06.649
Hide the children!

26:34.302 --> 26:35.678
Stay here.

26:36.012 --> 26:38.681
You stay here.
They're trying to kill me.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.815
Marishka, kill the stranger.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.066
Love to.

26:53.488 --> 26:54.989
Run!

27:05.166 --> 27:07.627
Carl, it's not working.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.879
Try aiming at their hearts.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.589
it's the sun.

28:54.359 --> 28:55.485
Van Helsing.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.493
Do you like to fly, Anna?

29:59.382 --> 30:01.009
Hello, Anna.

30:06.347 --> 30:08.349
Nice to see you, too, Aleera.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.188
Did I do something
to you in a past life?

30:55.271 --> 30:57.482
Don't play coy
with me, Princess.

31:01.027 --> 31:04.489
I know what lurks
in your lusting heart.

31:04.781 --> 31:07.283
I hope you have
a heart, Aleera,

31:07.367 --> 31:10.411
because someday I'm going to
drive a stake through it.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.299
This should do the trick.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.010
Holy water!

31:32.141 --> 31:35.478
Stop your teasing, Marishka,
and finish him.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.943
Too bad. So sad.

31:42.610 --> 31:43.986
The church!

31:55.957 --> 31:57.834
Thirty years old.

31:58.251 --> 31:59.961
Perfectly aged.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.839
Hello, Anna, my dear.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.853
The last of the Valerious.

32:50.928 --> 32:54.932
I can feel fresh blood
rushing through her veins.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.102
Here she comes!

33:03.316 --> 33:05.151
I want first bite.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.357
He killed a bride!

34:26.440 --> 34:27.775
He killed Marishka!

34:32.487 --> 34:34.574
You killed Marishka!

34:35.116 --> 34:36.617
You killed a vampire!

34:36.701 --> 34:38.202
But isn't that a good thing?

34:38.286 --> 34:41.205
Vampires only kill what
they need to survive.

34:41.289 --> 34:43.331
One or two people a month.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.877
Now they will kill for revenge.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.341
Are you always this popular?

34:52.425 --> 34:53.801
Pretty much.

34:53.884 --> 34:58.306
So what name, my good sir, do
I carve on your gravestone?

34:58.389 --> 35:00.474
His name is Van Helsing.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.442
Your reputation precedes you.

35:14.697 --> 35:17.825
Next time stay close.
You're no good to me dead.

35:18.576 --> 35:19.994
Well, I'll say this for you.

35:20.077 --> 35:21.579
You've got courage.

35:22.121 --> 35:25.583
He's the first one to kill
a vampire in over 100 years.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.419
I'd say that's
earned him a drink.

35:34.008 --> 35:35.718
Marishka!

35:45.019 --> 35:47.438
Why can't they
just leave us alone?

35:47.521 --> 35:51.817
We never kill more than our
fill and less than our share.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.819
Can they say the same?

35:54.654 --> 35:59.950
Did I not stress how important it was
to be finished with Anna Valerious

36:00.242 --> 36:03.704
before she destroys what
we are trying to create?

36:03.788 --> 36:05.206
We lost Marishka.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.832
Master.

36:06.916 --> 36:10.544
There, there, my darlings.
Do not worry.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.630
I shall find another bride.

36:12.713 --> 36:14.006
What?

36:14.757 --> 36:17.009
Do we mean so little to you?

36:17.093 --> 36:19.178
Have you no heart?

36:19.553 --> 36:23.599
No, I have no heart!
I feel no love!

36:24.266 --> 36:25.768
Nor fear,

36:26.894 --> 36:28.396
nor joy,

36:29.772 --> 36:31.232
nor sorrow!

36:33.150 --> 36:35.695
I am hollow.

36:39.281 --> 36:42.785
And I will live forever.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.412
My Lord.

36:44.495 --> 36:46.580
It is not so bad.

36:49.542 --> 36:55.548
I am at war with the world
and every living soul in it.

36:55.631 --> 36:59.218
But soon the final
battle will begin.

36:59.301 --> 37:02.138
I must go and find out
who our new visitor is.

37:05.891 --> 37:10.146
You will have to make a
little apéritif out of him.

37:10.813 --> 37:13.733
We are much too close to
success to be interrupted now.

37:13.816 --> 37:14.984
NO!

37:15.067 --> 37:17.528
The last
experiment was a failure!

37:17.611 --> 37:21.657
Please, say you
will not try again.

37:21.907 --> 37:26.245
My heart could not bear
the sorrow if we fail again.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.673
Come.

37:38.382 --> 37:41.635
Do not fear me.

37:41.719 --> 37:43.888
Everybody else fears me.

37:45.431 --> 37:46.891
Not my brides.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.104
Igor.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.191
Yes, Master.

37:56.108 --> 37:58.527
Why do you
torment that thing so?

37:59.278 --> 38:00.821
It's what I do.

38:01.030 --> 38:03.616
Remember, Igor,
"Do unto others..."

38:03.699 --> 38:07.995
Before they do unto me, Master.

38:08.412 --> 38:11.165
Now go, all of you!

38:11.791 --> 38:14.043
To Castle Frankenstein!

38:15.628 --> 38:19.089
Yes, we will try again.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.386
So, how did you get here?

38:24.470 --> 38:25.679
We came by sea.

38:25.763 --> 38:26.764
Really? The sea?

38:26.847 --> 38:27.807
Well, yes.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.183
The Adriatic Sea?

38:29.266 --> 38:30.976
So, where do I find Dracula?

38:31.060 --> 38:34.063
He used to live in this
very house four centuries ago.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.106
No one knows
where he lives now.

38:36.190 --> 38:38.275
Father would stare at
that painting for hours

38:38.359 --> 38:40.027
looking for Dracula's lair.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.821
So that's why you've come?

38:41.904 --> 38:43.322
I can help you.

38:43.864 --> 38:44.865
No one can help me.

38:44.949 --> 38:46.116
I can try.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.203
You can die trying.
All of my family has.

38:49.537 --> 38:50.788
I can handle this myself.

38:50.871 --> 38:52.164
So I noticed.

38:52.248 --> 38:53.791
The vampires
attacked in daylight.

38:53.874 --> 38:54.875
They never do that.

38:54.959 --> 38:57.336
I was unprepared.
It won't happen again.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.171
So why did they
attack in daylight?

38:59.255 --> 39:01.549
Clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard.

39:01.632 --> 39:03.926
They seem almost desperate
to finish off my family.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.845
Why is that? Why now?

39:05.928 --> 39:07.471
You ask a lot of questions.

39:07.555 --> 39:08.931
Usually I ask only two.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.850
What are we dealing with?
How do I kill it?

39:10.933 --> 39:12.268
My father spent
most of his life

39:12.351 --> 39:14.144
looking for
answers year after year.

39:14.687 --> 39:17.731
Tearing through the tower, combing
through the family archives.

39:17.815 --> 39:19.066
Carl, the tower. Start there.

39:19.149 --> 39:20.192
Right.

39:20.276 --> 39:23.696
The only way to save your family is
to stay alive till Dracula's killed.

39:23.779 --> 39:25.865
And who will
kill him if not me?

39:25.948 --> 39:27.366
Who will show
courage if not me?

39:27.449 --> 39:29.952
Go alone and you'll be
outmanned and outpositioned.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.871
And you can't see in the dark.

39:31.954 --> 39:34.456
In the morning,
we will hunt him

39:35.249 --> 39:37.293
but we'll do it together.

39:43.299 --> 39:46.176
Some say you're a murderer,
Mr. Van Helsing.

39:46.802 --> 39:50.472
Others say you're a holy man.
Which is it?

39:53.976 --> 39:56.145
It's a bit of both, I think.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.233
I promised you a drink.

40:01.317 --> 40:02.818
Yes, you did.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.905
The bar is down the hall.
Help yourself.

40:05.988 --> 40:09.366
As for me, I'm going to
finish this once and for all.

40:10.117 --> 40:12.244
I'm sorry you have to
carry this burden alone.

40:12.328 --> 40:14.538
On the contrary, I would
wish for it no other way.

40:14.622 --> 40:16.373
I'm sorry about your
father and brother.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.083
I will see them again.

40:18.167 --> 40:20.878
We Transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.588
There's a brighter
side of death?

40:22.671 --> 40:25.507
Yes. It's just harder to see.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.266
I'm sorry about that, too.

40:47.446 --> 40:48.864
Van Helsing!

40:59.959 --> 41:01.377
Van Helsing?

43:27.147 --> 43:29.024
Velkan?
Anna.

43:29.900 --> 43:31.944
Oh, my God, you're alive.

43:34.071 --> 43:35.906
No. Anna,
I only have a moment.

43:35.989 --> 43:37.741
But there's a werewolf...
Never mind! Listen to me!

43:37.825 --> 43:40.285
I know Dracula's secret.
He has a...

43:46.333 --> 43:47.876
Velkan?
Please.

43:49.044 --> 43:50.879
No!

44:18.407 --> 44:20.075
Run, Anna.

44:38.635 --> 44:39.761
Anna!

44:45.934 --> 44:47.644
Are you all right?

45:03.285 --> 45:05.746
Why does it smell
like wet dog in here?

45:05.829 --> 45:07.039
Werewolf!

45:07.122 --> 45:09.124
Right. You'll be needing
silver bullets, then.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.584
Well done.

45:59.341 --> 46:01.134
Who's hunting whom?

46:09.851 --> 46:13.522
Nice night.
This is a bit tight for me.

46:13.772 --> 46:17.693
But for you it's a perfect fit.

46:19.152 --> 46:20.904
What a coincidence.

46:21.697 --> 46:24.074
I see the wolf man
hasn't killed you yet.

46:24.157 --> 46:25.993
Don't worry,
he's getting to it.

46:26.076 --> 46:27.452
You don't seem
too bothered by him.

46:27.536 --> 46:29.121
I'm no threat to him.

46:29.204 --> 46:32.124
I'm just the one who
cleans up after him,

46:32.457 --> 46:34.126
if you get my meaning.

46:34.209 --> 46:36.295
Little late to be digging
graves, isn't it?

46:36.378 --> 46:38.630
Never too late to dig graves.

46:40.257 --> 46:43.719
You never know when
you'll need a fresh one.

46:46.179 --> 46:50.559
Oh, sorry.
It's just my nature.

47:03.405 --> 47:04.406
NO.

47:08.243 --> 47:09.619
- Move!
- NO!

47:13.874 --> 47:15.250
Why?

47:15.417 --> 47:16.877
You're choking me!

47:16.960 --> 47:18.920
Give me a reason not to.

47:19.004 --> 47:22.007
I can't. If people knew...

47:25.093 --> 47:27.596
He's not your
brother anymore, Anna!

47:28.972 --> 47:30.015
You knew?

47:30.098 --> 47:31.767
Yes.

47:33.226 --> 47:36.229
Before or after I stopped
you from shooting him?

47:36.605 --> 47:37.606
Before.

47:37.689 --> 47:39.024
And still you
tried to kill him!

47:39.107 --> 47:40.692
He's a werewolf!
He's gonna kill people!

47:40.776 --> 47:42.319
He can't help it!
It's not his fault!

47:42.402 --> 47:43.904
I know, but he'll do it anyway!

47:43.987 --> 47:46.281
Do you understand forgiveness?

47:46.448 --> 47:48.909
Yes. I ask for it often.

47:51.370 --> 47:53.372
They say Dracula has a cure.

47:53.455 --> 47:55.374
If there's a chance
I can save my brother,

47:55.457 --> 47:56.666
I'm going after it.
No.

47:56.750 --> 47:57.751
I need to find Dracula.

47:57.834 --> 47:59.586
And I need to find my brother!

47:59.669 --> 48:01.338
He gave his life for me.

48:01.421 --> 48:03.507
He's the only
family I have left.

48:04.466 --> 48:08.011
I despise Dracula more
than you can ever imagine.

48:08.095 --> 48:09.888
He has taken
everything from me,

48:09.971 --> 48:12.432
leaving me alone in this world.

48:26.988 --> 48:30.075
To have memories of those
you loved and lost

48:30.826 --> 48:34.037
is perhaps harder than to
have no memories at all.

48:36.164 --> 48:37.541
All right.

48:39.835 --> 48:41.628
We'll look for your brother.

49:10.699 --> 49:11.867
Igor.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.368
Yes, Master.

49:13.452 --> 49:14.953
How long before we are ready?

49:15.036 --> 49:17.038
Soon, Master. Very soon.

49:18.498 --> 49:24.129
It is difficult without the good doctor
but the Dwergi, they are doing well?

49:24.212 --> 49:25.297
NO!

49:26.840 --> 49:27.966
Good.

49:30.886 --> 49:32.721
For me, this is all personal.

49:32.846 --> 49:34.723
It's all about
family and honor.

49:35.390 --> 49:37.559
Why do you do it,
this job of yours?

49:37.642 --> 49:39.102
What do you hope
to get out of it?

49:39.186 --> 49:42.022
I don't know.
Maybe some self-realization.

49:42.814 --> 49:45.317
What have you got
out of it so far?

49:46.067 --> 49:47.861
Nightmares.

49:50.113 --> 49:53.033
Werewolves only shed
before the first full moon.

49:53.116 --> 49:55.160
Before the curse has
completely consumed them.

50:06.421 --> 50:07.672
What is this place?

50:07.756 --> 50:09.591
Castle Frankenstein.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.510
But it should be abandoned.

50:11.593 --> 50:12.761
I don't understand.

50:12.844 --> 50:15.263
The man who lived here
was killed a year ago.

50:15.347 --> 50:16.681
A grave robber,
among other things.

50:16.765 --> 50:18.016
A year ago.

50:18.099 --> 50:20.519
It was just after that that
your father went missing.

50:20.602 --> 50:22.729
Yes. He was
looking for Dracula.

50:22.812 --> 50:24.689
He was on his way to the sea.

50:25.982 --> 50:27.859
I have never been to the sea.

50:33.198 --> 50:35.200
I'll bet it's beautiful.

50:53.176 --> 50:56.972
Werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon.

50:58.139 --> 50:59.933
So hard to control.

51:23.707 --> 51:25.792
I send you on a simple errand

51:25.875 --> 51:28.336
to find out who
our new visitor is

51:28.962 --> 51:32.424
and you have to stop for a
little chat with your sister.

51:32.507 --> 51:34.509
Leave her out of this, Count.

51:34.593 --> 51:36.553
She doesn't know your secret.

51:36.636 --> 51:39.055
And I am soon to
take it to my grave.

51:40.098 --> 51:41.766
Don't wish for
death so quickly.

51:41.850 --> 51:43.768
I intend for you
to be quite useful.

51:43.852 --> 51:45.604
I would rather
die than help you.

51:45.687 --> 51:46.855
Don't be boring.

51:46.938 --> 51:48.773
Everyone who says that dies.

51:48.857 --> 51:50.442
Besides, tonight,

51:50.525 --> 51:52.444
after the final
stroke of midnight,

51:52.527 --> 51:55.196
you will have no
choice but to obey me.

51:57.657 --> 51:59.200
Look familiar?

52:03.705 --> 52:04.873
Father?

52:05.540 --> 52:07.334
No!

52:07.542 --> 52:08.877
He proved useless.

52:08.960 --> 52:12.255
But I'm hoping, with werewolf
venom running through your veins

52:12.339 --> 52:14.299
you will be of greater benefit!

52:18.553 --> 52:22.349
I may have failed to kill you,
Count, but my sister will not.

52:27.937 --> 52:31.191
Never!

52:48.792 --> 52:49.793
Dwergi.

52:49.876 --> 52:51.002
Dwergi?

52:51.086 --> 52:52.587
Dracula's servants.

52:52.671 --> 52:54.673
Industrious but
extremely vicious.

52:54.756 --> 52:57.676
If you get the chance to kill one, do
it because they'll do worse to you.

52:57.759 --> 52:59.094
Right.

53:04.641 --> 53:07.394
They say they're using my brother
in some sort of experiment.

53:07.477 --> 53:09.854
My brother is still battling
the sickness within him.

53:09.938 --> 53:11.022
There's still hope.

53:11.106 --> 53:12.148
Anna.

53:12.774 --> 53:15.110
There is no hope
for your brother.

53:15.193 --> 53:18.488
But we can still protect
others by killing Dracula.

53:25.787 --> 53:27.455
Let us begin!

53:36.548 --> 53:39.676
No slacking! Up!

53:54.566 --> 53:55.650
You ever
see these things before?

53:55.734 --> 53:56.735
NO.

53:56.818 --> 53:58.278
What do you think they are?

53:58.361 --> 53:59.529
Offspring.

53:59.612 --> 54:00.613
What?

54:00.697 --> 54:02.699
A man with three
gorgeous women for 400 years.

54:02.782 --> 54:05.535
Yes, vampires are
the walking dead.

54:05.618 --> 54:07.996
It only makes sense their
children are born dead.

54:08.079 --> 54:10.999
He's obviously trying
to bring them to life.

54:15.837 --> 54:17.338
Ladies first.

54:42.322 --> 54:46.034
Dracula and his brides only
kill one or two people a month.

54:46.451 --> 54:49.204
If he brings all these
things to life...

55:05.553 --> 55:06.930
Throw the switches!

55:07.013 --> 55:08.681
Yes, Master.

55:44.843 --> 55:46.052
What are you doing?

55:46.135 --> 55:47.762
I want to see what
we're up against.

56:18.710 --> 56:21.588
So this is what you
get when vampires mate.

56:43.985 --> 56:45.194
Come on!

57:16.643 --> 57:18.561
They need to feed.

57:18.645 --> 57:20.772
Teach them how. Teach them!

57:29.697 --> 57:31.491
And beg the Devil

57:32.951 --> 57:35.411
that this time they stay alive.

57:45.088 --> 57:46.172
This is where I come in.

57:46.255 --> 57:47.465
No, wait!

57:58.226 --> 58:00.687
Now that I have your attention.

58:24.502 --> 58:26.754
Yes, well, that's interesting.

58:35.388 --> 58:38.808
That's not good.
Must warn somebody.

58:52.447 --> 58:56.534
I can tell the character of a man
by the sound of his heartbeat.

58:57.618 --> 59:00.580
Usually when I approach

59:01.748 --> 59:05.376
I can almost dance to the beat.

59:07.587 --> 59:11.507
Strange that
yours is so steady.

59:20.141 --> 59:21.684
Hurry up!

59:23.770 --> 59:27.065
We must keep the
atmosphere electrified!

59:28.858 --> 59:31.027
Accelerate the generators!

59:31.986 --> 59:33.821
Power the dynamos!

59:35.031 --> 59:36.824
We are losing power.

59:37.867 --> 59:39.952
The human is insufficient.

59:45.666 --> 59:46.793
Velkan.

01:00:00.056 --> 01:00:01.432
Oh, my God.

01:00:32.004 --> 01:00:36.968
Feed, my darlings! Feed!

01:00:58.948 --> 01:01:00.700
May he rest in peace.

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:05.121
Hello, Gabriel.

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:06.933
We must not lose
the master's progeny!

01:02:10.061 --> 01:02:12.355
Is this your silver stake?

01:02:16.275 --> 01:02:20.238
How long has it been?
300, 400 years?

01:02:25.493 --> 01:02:27.662
You don't remember, do you?

01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:31.040
Exactly what is it I
should be remembering?

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:33.834
You are the great Van Helsing.

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:39.006
Trained by monks and mullahs
from Tibet to Istanbul.

01:02:40.216 --> 01:02:42.635
Protected by Rome herself.

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:46.764
But, like me,
hunted by all others.

01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:49.267
The Knights of the Holy
Order know all about you.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.102
It's no surprise you
would know about me.

01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:53.479
Yes, but it's much
more than this.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.655
We have such history,
you and I, Gabriel.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:12.248
Have you ever wondered why you
have such horrible nightmares?

01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:15.835
Horrific scenes of
ancient battles past.

01:03:20.298 --> 01:03:21.882
How do you know me?

01:03:29.724 --> 01:03:31.183
Velkan.

01:03:31.267 --> 01:03:32.727
Anna.

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.645
No. Don't unstrap me.

01:03:34.729 --> 01:03:35.813
Don't unstrap me.

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:38.816
No, you must not! No! Stop!

01:03:38.899 --> 01:03:40.443
Stop it.
I'm getting you out of here.

01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:43.070
Velkan, it's all right.
I'm taking you home.

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:53.873
So would you like me to
refresh your memory a little?

01:03:55.124 --> 01:03:57.793
A few details
from your sordid past.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:11.098
Perhaps that is a conversation
for another time.

01:04:12.975 --> 01:04:16.937
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:22.568
I am Count Vladislaus Dragulia.

01:04:24.487 --> 01:04:27.031
Born 1422.

01:04:28.157 --> 01:04:31.786
Murdered 1462.

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:46.967
Help me!

01:05:35.224 --> 01:05:37.810
I think we've
overstayed our welcome.

01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:25.566
Have you found the children?

01:06:25.733 --> 01:06:26.942
Not yet.

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:32.323
What happened?

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:34.033
They just died.

01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:40.748
How can I ever repay you?

01:06:48.255 --> 01:06:50.841
But you can't do that.
You are a monk.

01:06:50.925 --> 01:06:53.260
Well,
actually I'm just a friar.

01:06:56.222 --> 01:06:59.558
I am sorry, master.
We try and we try,

01:06:59.642 --> 01:07:04.188
but I fear we are not so smart as Dr.
Frankenstein.

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:06.065
Truly.

01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:11.278
It would appear the good doctor
took the key to life to his grave.

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:18.118
Hunt them down.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.289
Kill them both.

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:27.753
A silver stake?
A crucifix?

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.714
What, did you think we haven't
tried everything before?

01:07:30.798 --> 01:07:33.509
We've shot him,
stabbed him, clubbed him,

01:07:33.592 --> 01:07:35.803
sprayed him with holy water,
staked him through the heart,

01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:38.180
and still he lives!
Do you understand?

01:07:38.264 --> 01:07:40.099
No one knows how
to kill Dracula.

01:07:40.182 --> 01:07:43.811
Well, I could have used that
information a little earlier.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:46.146
Don't give me that look.

01:07:50.568 --> 01:07:53.445
You were right. I'm sorry.

01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:56.407
He's not my brother anymore.

01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:13.882
Do you have any family,
Mr. Van Helsing?

01:08:15.634 --> 01:08:18.178
Not sure.
I hope to find out someday.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.389
That's what keeps me going.

01:08:21.849 --> 01:08:23.309
Here's to what keeps you going.

01:08:23.392 --> 01:08:25.477
Absinthe. Strong stuff.

01:08:29.732 --> 01:08:33.152
Don't let it touch your tongue.
it'll knock you on your...

01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:54.506
Vampire.

01:08:57.843 --> 01:08:59.136
Vampires!

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.853
Now I remember.

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:24.161
"Even a man who is pure in heart
And says his prayers by night

01:09:24.912 --> 01:09:29.291
"May become a wolf
when the wolf bane blooms

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.294
"And the moon is shining bright

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.006
"Or crave another's blood
when the sun goes down

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:38.341
"And his body takes to flight"

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.467
There's something down here.

01:10:22.845 --> 01:10:24.722
And it's carnivorous.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:31.103
Whatever it is,
it appears to be human.

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:39.987
I'd say he's a size 17.
Around 360 pounds.

01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:43.031
8.5 to 9 feet tall.

01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:48.120
He has a bad gimp in his right
leg and three copper teeth.

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.164
How do you know
he has copper teeth?

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:52.833
Because he's standing
right behind you. Move!

01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:01.550
On, my God!
The Frankenstein monster!

01:11:01.633 --> 01:11:04.803
Monster?
Who's the monster here?

01:11:06.764 --> 01:11:12.060
I have done nothing wrong and yet
you and your kind all wish me dead!

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.209
What do you want?

01:11:37.044 --> 01:11:38.712
To exist.

01:11:51.433 --> 01:11:52.559
Don't!

01:11:53.018 --> 01:11:54.186
We must kill it.
Wait.

01:11:54.269 --> 01:11:57.731
If you value your lives
and the lives of your kind,

01:11:58.273 --> 01:11:59.983
you will kill me.

01:12:00.067 --> 01:12:01.276
No.

01:12:01.693 --> 01:12:03.612
If Dracula finds me.

01:12:05.739 --> 01:12:09.243
I am the key to
my father's machine.

01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:12.079
The key to life.

01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:15.791
Life for Dracula's children.

01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.501
He already
awakened them last night.

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.044
Two.

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:22.297
And those were
from only one bride.

01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:26.385
From one single birthing.

01:12:26.927 --> 01:12:30.097
And they died as they did
the last time he tried.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:38.188
Only with me can he
give them lasting life.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:40.941
There are more?
More of those things?

01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:43.443
Thousands.

01:12:44.945 --> 01:12:46.446
Thousands more.

01:13:00.127 --> 01:13:02.087
No.
You heard what he said.

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:05.382
My life, my job is
to vanquish evil.

01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:06.967
I can sense evil.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.386
This thing, man, whatever it is

01:13:09.469 --> 01:13:12.055
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.

01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:15.183
But evil does not rule
it, so I cannot kill it.

01:13:15.601 --> 01:13:17.728
I can.
Not while I'm here.

01:13:23.692 --> 01:13:25.986
Your family has spent 400
years trying to kill Dracula.

01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:29.156
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.

01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:40.959
Oh, my God. He's seen us.

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.170
Now they'll come for him.

01:13:43.253 --> 01:13:45.172
Neither you nor I will
be able to stop them.

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:48.508
If I can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:51.762
And then the painting came alive and
the two creatures attacked each other.

01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:52.888
What does it mean?

01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:53.931
I don't know.

01:13:54.014 --> 01:13:56.683
Listen, Carl, whatever you
do, don't stare at him.

01:13:58.644 --> 01:14:00.771
I'm staring at him.

01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:02.230
Is that a man?

01:14:02.314 --> 01:14:03.357
Actually, it's seven men.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.441
Parts of them, anyway.

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:07.152
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:09.029
Me and all of humanity!

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.698
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.

01:14:11.782 --> 01:14:13.533
Not even a werewolf.

01:14:13.784 --> 01:14:16.203
Anything else,
you're on your own.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.010
Let me go.

01:14:32.094 --> 01:14:33.512
Where are you going to go?

01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:37.057
I don't know if you've seen a mirror lately
but you kind of stick out in a crowd.

01:16:55.779 --> 01:16:58.907
We must not let the
creature be destroyed!

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:08.333
Save him!
Save the monster!

01:17:29.062 --> 01:17:30.272
Stakes!

01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:42.409
No!

01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:04.472
Oh, my God.

01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:13.315
What are you doing out here?

01:18:13.315 --> 01:18:15.525
- Cam
- Right.

01:18:15.942 --> 01:18:17.569
Don't let go!

01:18:30.582 --> 01:18:31.958
I can help!

01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:33.460
You won't kill me?

01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:35.545
Only if you don't hurry!

01:19:58.753 --> 01:19:59.754
Velkan.

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:08.888
Anna.

01:20:16.313 --> 01:20:17.731
Forgive me.

01:20:26.364 --> 01:20:28.158
I will see you again.

01:20:39.419 --> 01:20:41.087
You killed him.

01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:45.633
Now you know why
they call me murderer.

01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:55.268
Oh, my God.

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:58.730
You've been bitten.

01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:27.634
Anna.

01:21:52.492 --> 01:21:54.494
So much trouble to my master.

01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:56.704
So much trouble.

01:21:57.455 --> 01:21:58.540
What do you want?

01:21:58.623 --> 01:22:00.834
The master commands a trade.

01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:06.923
The monster for the Princess.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.843
Somewhere public.
Lots of people.

01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:14.264
A place where your master
will be less inclined

01:22:14.347 --> 01:22:16.641
to expose his other side.

01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:22.689
Tomorrow night is
All Hallows' Eve.

01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:27.527
Here in Budapest, there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.

01:22:38.705 --> 01:22:40.248
Are you all right?
No.

01:22:43.835 --> 01:22:45.336
He has been bitten.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.213
Bitten by a werewolf.

01:22:48.548 --> 01:22:52.427
Now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately.

01:23:00.185 --> 01:23:01.561
I am sorry.

01:23:02.395 --> 01:23:06.024
May others be as passionate
in their hunting of you.

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:13.531
Well, they won't
find him in here.

01:23:13.907 --> 01:23:15.492
I'm sure this is
some sort of sin.

01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:16.951
Don't worry,
God will forgive us.

01:23:17.035 --> 01:23:18.328
We need to save Anna.

01:23:18.411 --> 01:23:19.954
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?

01:23:20.038 --> 01:23:21.581
Carl, help me!
Right.

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:24.459
How many commandments
can we break in one day?

01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:26.544
Anyway, according to the book

01:23:26.628 --> 01:23:30.006
you won't turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon.

01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:31.674
That's two nights from now.

01:23:31.758 --> 01:23:34.260
Even then, you'll still be able
to fight Dracula's hold over you

01:23:34.344 --> 01:23:35.970
until the final
stroke of midnight.

01:23:36.054 --> 01:23:37.347
Sounds like I
have nothing to worry about.

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:39.224
My God,
you should be terrified.

01:23:39.307 --> 01:23:40.850
Thank you.
Sorry.

01:23:40.934 --> 01:23:44.103
We still have 48 hours
to find a solution.

01:23:44.187 --> 01:23:45.522
You sure he can't
get out of there?

01:23:45.605 --> 01:23:48.066
Not without some
help from the dead.

01:25:13.693 --> 01:25:16.863
How does it feel to be
a puppet on my string?

01:25:16.946 --> 01:25:19.198
I won't let you
trade me, Count.

01:25:19.866 --> 01:25:22.368
I have no intention
of trading you.

01:25:22.493 --> 01:25:25.496
And if I know Van Helsing,
which I do,

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:28.207
he is not planning on
making a trade, either.

01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:32.420
Neither of us has
ever settled for half.

01:25:39.093 --> 01:25:40.553
There they are.

01:25:40.637 --> 01:25:42.555
You make my skin crawl.

01:25:43.598 --> 01:25:48.269
This is not all I
could do with your skin.

01:25:58.404 --> 01:26:00.740
Carl, I need you
to do something.

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:02.408
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

01:26:07.121 --> 01:26:09.415
Don't we make a lovely couple?

01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:11.167
Oh, my God.

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.586
I am looking for
a new bride, Anna.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:17.924
Someone strong and beautiful.

01:26:29.519 --> 01:26:31.771
One brief moment of pain,

01:26:33.439 --> 01:26:35.608
and we can be together forever.

01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:45.952
You have no heartbeat.

01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:51.416
Perhaps it just needs

01:26:51.499 --> 01:26:53.292
to be rekindled.

01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:20.319
Anna. Anna!

01:27:20.695 --> 01:27:21.946
Wake up.

01:27:22.447 --> 01:27:23.698
Gabriel.

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:27.994
Oh, Gabriel.

01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:34.542
Oh, Gabriel.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:40.298
Welcome to my summer palace.

01:27:42.341 --> 01:27:45.136
Master! Look, Master!

01:27:46.763 --> 01:27:48.931
We have him, Master.

01:27:49.015 --> 01:27:50.516
We have him.

01:27:52.393 --> 01:27:54.812
You wretched undead!

01:27:54.896 --> 01:27:57.190
I shall have my revenge!

01:27:57.690 --> 01:28:01.110
"Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death

01:28:01.194 --> 01:28:04.071
"l shall fear no evil."

01:28:04.197 --> 01:28:07.283
You are nothing
but damned bones

01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:09.410
and damned souls,

01:28:09.494 --> 01:28:13.873
and will burn in
the flames of Hell!

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:23.049
Now that everything
is as it should be,

01:28:24.717 --> 01:28:28.638
ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you,

01:28:30.223 --> 01:28:32.308
Van Helsing!

01:28:37.438 --> 01:28:38.689
Come on.

01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:43.945
Yes!

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.411
Now I know what it's for.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.330
Where are we going?

01:28:54.413 --> 01:28:55.581
Through that window!

01:29:13.641 --> 01:29:15.601
Carl, you're a genius!

01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:19.021
A genius with access
to unstable chemicals.

01:29:30.616 --> 01:29:32.952
Say goodbye to your friends.

01:29:52.972 --> 01:29:55.892
I'll find you!
I'll get you back and set you free!

01:29:55.975 --> 01:29:57.518
I swear to God!

01:30:05.443 --> 01:30:06.485
I must save him.

01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:09.030
No, you can't.
Why?

01:30:09.113 --> 01:30:11.407
I cabled Rome earlier to
apprise them of our situation.

01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:12.533
What did they say?

01:30:12.617 --> 01:30:13.826
Even if you
somehow kill Dracula,

01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:17.246
Rome orders you to destroy
Frankenstein as well.

01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:18.372
He isn't evil.

01:30:18.456 --> 01:30:20.249
But they say he
isn't human, either.

01:30:20.333 --> 01:30:21.876
Do they know him?
Have they spoken to him?

01:30:21.959 --> 01:30:23.002
Who are they to judge?

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:26.130
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.

01:30:26.213 --> 01:30:28.549
What of me?
Did you tell them what I'm to become?

01:30:28.633 --> 01:30:30.509
Did they tell
you how to kill me?

01:30:30.593 --> 01:30:33.262
The correct angle of the
stake as it enters my heart?

01:30:33.346 --> 01:30:35.681
The exact measure of
silver in each bullet?

01:30:36.515 --> 01:30:37.683
Stop!

01:30:37.767 --> 01:30:38.893
No, I left you out!

01:30:57.495 --> 01:30:58.829
I'm sorry.

01:31:03.793 --> 01:31:05.252
It's starting.

01:31:19.934 --> 01:31:23.062
They must have taken all
the equipment to Dracula's lair.

01:31:23.854 --> 01:31:25.398
Wherever that is.

01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:32.238
Look, there's still time.

01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:34.949
Dracula can't bring his children
to life until the sun sets.

01:31:35.032 --> 01:31:36.283
The sun sets in two hours.

01:31:36.367 --> 01:31:38.285
We've been looking for him
for more than 400 years!

01:31:38.369 --> 01:31:42.039
Yes, well, I wasn't around for
those 400 years, now, was I?

01:31:43.374 --> 01:31:45.084
All right, Carl,
what have you learned?

01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:48.504
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

01:31:48.587 --> 01:31:49.964
The son of your ancestor.

01:31:50.047 --> 01:31:52.008
Everybody knows that.
What else?

01:31:52.091 --> 01:31:57.680
All right. Well, according to this rubbing
it all started when Dracula was murdered.

01:31:57.763 --> 01:31:59.056
Do you know who murdered him?
No,

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:02.018
there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

01:32:02.101 --> 01:32:06.188
And in 1462, when Dracula died,

01:32:06.272 --> 01:32:07.857
he made a covenant
with the Devil.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.483
And was given a new life.

01:32:09.567 --> 01:32:12.445
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

01:32:12.528 --> 01:32:14.697
Excuse me. Are you going
to let me tell the story?

01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:15.781
Sorry.

01:32:15.865 --> 01:32:18.784
And your ancestor, having
sired this evil creature,

01:32:18.868 --> 01:32:21.287
went to Rome to
seek forgiveness.

01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:23.414
That's when the
bargain was made.

01:32:23.497 --> 01:32:24.665
He was to kill Dracula

01:32:24.749 --> 01:32:28.377
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family

01:32:28.461 --> 01:32:30.755
right down the line
all the way to you.

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:32.548
But he couldn't do it.

01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:35.217
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

01:32:35.301 --> 01:32:38.888
So he banished him
to an icy fortress

01:32:38.971 --> 01:32:41.390
sending him through a door from
which there was no return.

01:32:41.474 --> 01:32:42.475
And then the Devil
gave him wings.

01:32:42.558 --> 01:32:43.559
Yes.

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:45.144
All right,
so where is this door?

01:32:45.269 --> 01:32:46.812
I don't know.

01:32:48.022 --> 01:32:51.067
But when your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.

01:32:53.027 --> 01:32:55.863
So that future generations
might do it for him.

01:32:55.946 --> 01:32:58.115
That must be what my father
was looking for in here.

01:32:58.199 --> 01:33:00.326
Clues to the door's location.

01:33:00.409 --> 01:33:01.744
The door.

01:33:04.371 --> 01:33:05.498
Of course.

01:33:06.832 --> 01:33:08.709
You said your father spent hours
staring at this painting,

01:33:08.793 --> 01:33:09.919
trying to find the lair.

01:33:10.002 --> 01:33:11.420
I think you were right.
Quite literally.

01:33:11.504 --> 01:33:15.341
I think this is the door.
He just didn't know how to open it.

01:33:15.424 --> 01:33:17.259
Look.
A Latin inscription.

01:33:17.343 --> 01:33:19.303
Maybe it works like that
painting in the tower.

01:33:19.386 --> 01:33:22.723
If this were a door, my father
would have opened it long ago.

01:33:23.808 --> 01:33:27.353
I can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.

01:33:33.317 --> 01:33:34.610
Your father didn't have this.

01:33:34.693 --> 01:33:35.820
Where did you get that?

01:33:35.903 --> 01:33:37.530
Carl, finish it.

01:33:44.954 --> 01:33:47.748
In the name of God,
open this door.

01:34:00.052 --> 01:34:01.387
A mirror.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.306
Dracula has no reflection
in the mirror.

01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:05.641
But why?

01:34:08.269 --> 01:34:11.147
Maybe, to Dracula it's
not a mirror at all.

01:34:32.042 --> 01:34:35.796
It's cold.
And it's snowing.

01:34:40.926 --> 01:34:42.970
See you on the other side.

01:34:46.098 --> 01:34:47.516
Be careful.

01:35:29.516 --> 01:35:31.101
Castle Dracula.

01:36:22.069 --> 01:36:23.404
Do we have a plan?

01:36:23.487 --> 01:36:25.322
It doesn't have to be
Wellington's at Waterloo,

01:36:25.406 --> 01:36:26.699
but some sort of
plan would be nice.

01:36:26.782 --> 01:36:28.117
We're going to go stop Dracula.

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.286
And kill anything
that gets in our way.

01:36:30.369 --> 01:36:32.705
Well, you let
me know how that goes.

01:36:44.091 --> 01:36:45.801
Well, as grateful as I am
to be out of the cold,

01:36:45.884 --> 01:36:48.429
that doesn't seem
like a good thing.

01:36:53.726 --> 01:36:55.644
We'd better get moving.

01:37:08.073 --> 01:37:09.199
So are all of those...

01:37:09.283 --> 01:37:10.367
Yes.

01:37:10.451 --> 01:37:12.161
- And inside them are...
- Yes.

01:37:12.244 --> 01:37:15.247
Igor do this!
Igor do that!

01:37:17.624 --> 01:37:20.252
How did you find...
it's impossible!

01:37:25.257 --> 01:37:26.508
Please don't kill me!

01:37:26.592 --> 01:37:27.676
Why not?

01:37:28.886 --> 01:37:30.346
Well, I...

01:37:41.106 --> 01:37:43.317
My master has awakened.

01:38:04.463 --> 01:38:05.839
There is a cure.

01:38:05.923 --> 01:38:07.216
What?

01:38:07.299 --> 01:38:11.470
Dracula. He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!

01:38:12.388 --> 01:38:16.809
Go, find the cure!
Save yourself!

01:38:28.112 --> 01:38:29.905
Come on. You heard him.
Let's find it.

01:38:29.988 --> 01:38:31.782
Wait.
Why does Dracula have a cure?

01:38:31.865 --> 01:38:32.991
I don't care!

01:38:33.075 --> 01:38:34.284
I do.

01:38:34.868 --> 01:38:37.329
Why does he need one?
Why?

01:38:37.996 --> 01:38:42.209
Because the only thing that
can kill him is a werewolf.

01:38:42.292 --> 01:38:43.752
The painting.
That's what it meant.

01:38:43.836 --> 01:38:46.839
But Dracula's been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries.

01:38:46.922 --> 01:38:49.675
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:52.970
to remove the curse and make
him human before it bit him.

01:38:54.888 --> 01:38:57.266
You're going to take these two
and lead them to the antidote.

01:38:57.349 --> 01:38:58.559
No, I'm not.

01:38:59.893 --> 01:39:01.270
Yes, I am.

01:39:02.104 --> 01:39:04.398
Here's the plan.
When the bell begins to toll midnight,

01:39:04.481 --> 01:39:05.774
you'll be able to kill Dracula.

01:39:05.858 --> 01:39:08.652
We just need to find the cure and get
it into you before the final stroke.

01:39:08.735 --> 01:39:10.779
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?

01:39:10.863 --> 01:39:14.074
If they even suspect
you of misleading them...

01:39:14.158 --> 01:39:15.451
Clip off one of his fingers.

01:39:15.534 --> 01:39:16.535
I'll clip off something.

01:39:16.618 --> 01:39:18.704
The tower over there,
that's where it is.

01:39:18.787 --> 01:39:20.289
And what about the other tower?

01:39:20.372 --> 01:39:21.665
Give me that!
That is where

01:39:21.748 --> 01:39:23.792
we reassembled the laboratory.

01:39:23.876 --> 01:39:25.377
Would I lie to you?

01:39:26.378 --> 01:39:27.838
Not if you wanted to live.

01:39:29.047 --> 01:39:32.926
Now, if I'm not cured by the
twelfth stroke of midnight...

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:37.639
I don't think I could.

01:39:37.723 --> 01:39:39.057
You must.

01:39:44.855 --> 01:39:46.106
Come on.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:49.651
I don't like this plan.

01:39:49.735 --> 01:39:50.986
We don't have a choice.

01:39:51.069 --> 01:39:52.154
Just don't get killed.

01:39:52.237 --> 01:39:54.072
You still don't understand.

01:39:54.156 --> 01:39:56.492
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

01:39:56.575 --> 01:39:58.535
We must save my family.

01:39:58.952 --> 01:40:01.830
If you're late, run like hell.

01:40:06.084 --> 01:40:07.628
Don't be late.

01:40:21.183 --> 01:40:23.727
Now go. Go.

01:40:49.419 --> 01:40:52.130
Get off me,
you vermin from hell!

01:40:55.842 --> 01:40:59.388
What are you complaining about?
This is why you were made!

01:40:59.471 --> 01:41:03.559
To prove that God is not the
only one who can create life!

01:41:04.268 --> 01:41:08.438
And now you must give
that life to my children.

01:41:08.939 --> 01:41:09.982
Up!

01:42:24.473 --> 01:42:26.058
There it is.

01:42:31.438 --> 01:42:33.065
I'll go first.

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.546
Carl!

01:42:59.216 --> 01:43:04.346
Stay as long as you like.
You try to get Igor. Igor get you!

01:43:47.347 --> 01:43:49.433
Go ahead. Grab it.

01:43:49.558 --> 01:43:51.643
You go ahead and grab it.

01:43:52.269 --> 01:43:54.688
If there's one thing I've learned
it's never to be the first to stick

01:43:54.771 --> 01:43:56.815
your hand in
a viscous material.

01:44:03.822 --> 01:44:05.365
Did I scare you?

01:44:05.449 --> 01:44:06.908
No.

01:44:07.909 --> 01:44:11.455
Then maybe I need to
try a little harder.

01:44:18.837 --> 01:44:21.590
Viscous material!
What did I tell you?

01:44:21.673 --> 01:44:23.341
Get it!

01:44:32.184 --> 01:44:34.352
Hot.

01:44:34.436 --> 01:44:35.437
Come on!
Yes.

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:39.024
We've got to get the
antidote to Van Helsing! Go!

01:44:42.194 --> 01:44:43.987
You can't go until
I say you can go!

01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:45.697
Keep running, Carl!

01:44:46.907 --> 01:44:49.701
And I'll say you can
go when you're dead!

01:45:33.245 --> 01:45:34.746
Oh, my God!

01:46:04.901 --> 01:46:08.363
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

01:46:08.446 --> 01:46:09.823
My friends are doing it for me.

01:46:09.906 --> 01:46:11.199
Friends.

01:46:11.283 --> 01:46:12.993
Yes. You want one?

01:46:13.076 --> 01:46:14.369
I can't unscrew the bolts.

01:46:14.452 --> 01:46:15.745
This is gonna hurt.

01:46:15.829 --> 01:46:17.706
I am accustomed to pain.

01:46:17.789 --> 01:46:19.583
It lets you know you're alive.

01:46:37.601 --> 01:46:39.769
Give me life!

01:46:55.076 --> 01:46:58.830
One more bolt and
my young will live.

01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:14.804
You're almost out, my friend!

01:49:32.317 --> 01:49:33.818
Help me!

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.488
But you're supposed to die.

01:49:37.155 --> 01:49:39.407
I want to live.

01:49:42.827 --> 01:49:44.162
Au right!

01:49:49.167 --> 01:49:51.252
Be happy in the knowledge

01:49:51.336 --> 01:49:55.298
that I shall weep
over your dead body.

01:49:59.469 --> 01:50:01.679
Hang on!

01:50:02.514 --> 01:50:04.849
I'll swing you loose!

01:50:38.967 --> 01:50:41.177
You are too late, my friend.

01:50:42.428 --> 01:50:44.180
My children live.

01:50:44.931 --> 01:50:47.934
Then the only way to
kill them is to kill you.

01:50:48.601 --> 01:50:49.727
Correct.

01:50:52.564 --> 01:50:53.898
So be it.

01:50:57.986 --> 01:50:59.070
One.

01:51:05.034 --> 01:51:07.829
No, this cannot be.

01:51:21.926 --> 01:51:25.471
We are both part of the
same grand game, Gabriel.

01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:29.809
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

01:52:16.773 --> 01:52:21.152
Go!
Go and help Van Helsing!

01:52:25.073 --> 01:52:26.407
Now!

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.077
Thank you.

01:52:56.062 --> 01:53:01.109
Oh, my God! Anna,
I need a little help!

01:53:04.237 --> 01:53:05.446
Hurry!

01:53:16.416 --> 01:53:18.584
Throw it to me, Carl!

01:53:25.049 --> 01:53:26.050
Yes!

01:53:47.447 --> 01:53:50.950
You are being used,
Gabriel, as was I.

01:53:51.367 --> 01:53:54.037
But I escaped. So can you.

01:54:36.871 --> 01:54:38.581
Anna, my love,

01:54:38.664 --> 01:54:42.293
it is your blood that
shall keep me beautiful.

01:54:43.002 --> 01:54:45.088
What do you think of that?

01:54:49.425 --> 01:54:51.969
I think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

01:54:52.053 --> 01:54:54.222
Don't stand there
talking about it.

01:55:18.496 --> 01:55:22.959
Don't you understand?
We could be friends.

01:55:23.334 --> 01:55:24.419
Partners!

01:55:25.711 --> 01:55:27.380
Brothers-in-arms!

01:55:58.077 --> 01:56:02.290
Did I mention that it
was you who murdered me?

01:56:03.166 --> 01:56:10.047
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse to be the Left Hand of God.

01:56:12.967 --> 01:56:15.595
All I want is life, Gabriel.

01:56:16.429 --> 01:56:19.140
The continuation of my kind.

01:56:19.223 --> 01:56:23.060
And perhaps
the return of my ring.

01:56:27.106 --> 01:56:30.067
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

01:56:31.444 --> 01:56:36.699
I shall give you back
your life, your memory.

01:56:37.575 --> 01:56:39.827
Some things are
better left forgotten.

01:57:13.402 --> 01:57:14.654
For God!

01:57:23.788 --> 01:57:25.373
God forgive me.

01:58:00.157 --> 01:58:01.534
She's dead.

01:58:58.341 --> 01:59:00.092
"Eternal rest grant unto her,

01:59:00.176 --> 01:59:01.594
"Oh, Lord,
and let perpetual light

01:59:01.677 --> 01:59:04.096
”shine upon her.
On her soul and the souls of all

01:59:11.937 --> 01:59:13.731
”On her soul and
the souls of all

01:59:13.814 --> 01:59:17.401
"the dead
faithful have mercy.”
