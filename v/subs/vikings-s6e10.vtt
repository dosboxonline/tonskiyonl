00:02.306 --> 00:03.003
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:14.596 --> 01:15.814
Bjorn Ironside.

01:16.815 --> 01:17.816
King Harald.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.084
Queen Gunnhild.

01:24.867 --> 01:25.824
King Harald.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.134
I don't know you.
Should I?

01:32.744 --> 01:35.182
My name is Ingrid,
King Harald.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.359
She is my wife...

01:40.578 --> 01:42.363
-also.
-Your wife?

01:45.061 --> 01:46.541
I have been persuaded that

01:46.584 --> 01:49.500
we are in imminent danger
of an attack by the Rus...

01:49.544 --> 01:52.242
whoever, whatever they are.

01:52.286 --> 01:55.550
In which case,
we must prepare ourselves.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.204
And if we are prepared,

01:57.247 --> 02:00.032
no doubt we will
repel those foreign forces.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.644
[Erik] I know your reputation.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.342
I know how many battles
you have won,

02:05.386 --> 02:07.344
but, still,

02:07.388 --> 02:10.130
you have no idea
what you are now facing.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.176
What we are now facing.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.267
Which is?

02:17.311 --> 02:18.312
The twilight of the gods.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.271
The end of everything.

02:22.403 --> 02:23.926
[chuckles]

02:26.146 --> 02:30.062
People always say
it's the end of everything.

02:30.106 --> 02:33.022
Yes, but they
don't usually mean it.

02:35.633 --> 02:36.808
King Harald.

02:42.292 --> 02:46.035
You are the king of all Norway

02:46.078 --> 02:51.127
and you have spent
a lifetime achieving it.

02:51.171 --> 02:56.088
Now, you must
justify your position.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.918
The gods are asking you,

02:59.962 --> 03:06.360
how will you defend them
against the might
of the Christian Rus?

03:06.403 --> 03:10.364
And now you must answer them.

03:18.154 --> 03:21.331
[Bjorn] I have to assume
that the Rus
will attack from the sea.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.727
And if we are correct,

03:25.770 --> 03:27.511
and they are going
to attack our capital,

03:29.296 --> 03:31.907
then this is where
they will be heading for.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.083
[Erik] They could land
anywhere along the coast

03:34.126 --> 03:36.172
and attack us over ground.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.262
[Bjorn] But not
if we assume they have
a huge number of ships.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.482
There are only a few places
you can safely disembark

03:41.525 --> 03:45.050
that many warriors,
and this here is one of them.

03:45.094 --> 03:48.053
We will block the entrance
leading into the fjord here,

03:48.097 --> 03:50.317
and we will lay a boom across
the mouth of the river here,

03:50.360 --> 03:54.321
so Ivar cannot crush us
in a pincer movement.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.888
[Gunnhild] I understand
that we can fortify
the beach here,

03:56.932 --> 03:58.716
and lay booms
and other obstacles

03:58.760 --> 04:01.110
across the mouths
of the rivers.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.547
But we still have to accept
that a large part
of their army

04:03.591 --> 04:06.158
will manage to come ashore.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.552
How are we to repel
such a huge force?

04:08.596 --> 04:11.294
Harald has summoned all his
vassal Kings and warriors

04:11.338 --> 04:12.252
to come to our aid.

04:16.734 --> 04:17.822
Do you think
they will come?

04:19.737 --> 04:20.999
The other Kings?

04:29.921 --> 04:30.835
I don't.

04:37.581 --> 04:38.713
[Ivar] We leave in spring.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.541
Are you...

04:41.498 --> 04:44.719
ready to return to Norway?

04:44.762 --> 04:48.157
Are you ready
to fight against Bjorn,
with me and the Rus?

04:49.376 --> 04:52.030
[Hvitserk] I see now that,

04:52.074 --> 04:54.816
a lot of my life,
I have fought
against my fate.

04:54.859 --> 04:57.775
But now I'm resigned.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.605
Resigned? To what?

05:03.868 --> 05:08.395
I have committed myself
to the destructive element.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.013
[chuckles softly]

05:55.920 --> 05:57.008
[exhales]

06:32.566 --> 06:33.393
[softly] Don't.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.488
[Ivar exhales]

06:51.628 --> 06:53.543
[kissing]

06:55.676 --> 06:56.677
[hesitatingly] I can't...

06:58.330 --> 06:59.331
[gasps]

07:00.898 --> 07:02.422
You know I can't.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.861
[whispers] Of course, you can.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.089
No.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.719
[Viking 1]
Leave them with the arrows,
farther up the shore!

08:22.763 --> 08:24.982
[Thorkell]
An extraordinary sight,
Bjorn Ironside.

08:25.026 --> 08:28.420
[Viking 2] Give me
that hammer! Quick!

08:28.464 --> 08:30.161
[Bjorn] We are grateful that
you and your warriors

08:30.205 --> 08:31.815
have come to join us,
Jarl Thorkell.

08:31.859 --> 08:32.860
[softly] Aye.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.212
Our country
is in grave danger.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.652
Let me ask you,
where are your brothers?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.657
Herring? Earl Sigvald?

08:49.311 --> 08:50.660
Why aren't they here?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.664
Not to mention
Jarl Hrolf and King Hakon

08:54.708 --> 08:56.536
and everyone else
who voted for King Harald.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.626
They are free people.
[sighs]

09:00.844 --> 09:02.454
You know that is
the way with us.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.675
And if they choose
not to come,

09:07.634 --> 09:08.939
then so be it.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.637
I don't agree!

09:10.680 --> 09:12.421
They should be here

09:12.464 --> 09:13.901
helping us prepare
for the invasion of the Rus!

09:20.255 --> 09:21.343
Nothing else matters.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.611
[Viking shouting indistinctly]

09:28.655 --> 09:30.657
[hammering]

09:35.139 --> 09:36.793
[breathing heavily]

09:36.837 --> 09:37.838
[Erik] You don't
have to do this.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.711
You're going to have a baby.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.713
I'm going to have
a Norwegian baby.

09:43.757 --> 09:44.671
Not a Rus baby!

09:45.889 --> 09:47.195
Do you understand that?

09:47.238 --> 09:49.327
[breathing heavily]

10:01.949 --> 10:05.300
So, you're saying
your archers aren't enough.

10:05.343 --> 10:09.086
Bjorn Ironside,
we have some misgivings.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.698
Who doesn't, being human?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.656
[chuckles]

10:14.701 --> 10:16.659
This is serious.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.880
We have concerns
that our defenses are being
stretched too wide

10:19.923 --> 10:21.751
and that you are
trying too hard

10:21.795 --> 10:23.623
to second-guess
the points of attack.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.848
We know my brother Ivar
is with them.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.372
I'm only trying to anticipate
what he's going to do.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.769
I know him very well.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.466
But if you
misread his intentions--

10:41.510 --> 10:44.382
Then we are defeated!
What are you saying?

10:44.426 --> 10:46.384
Don't you understand
that they are going to attack

10:46.428 --> 10:47.821
in overwhelming numbers?

10:47.864 --> 10:48.865
Yes.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.435
If you have a better plan...

10:58.745 --> 10:59.833
I didn't think so.

11:06.187 --> 11:09.320
[Viking] Tie it down
or the wind will take it!

11:09.364 --> 11:12.759
[indistinct shouting]

11:15.762 --> 11:16.937
[Harald]
So, you are Bjorn's wife?

11:20.854 --> 11:21.811
Yes.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.819
You don't have
much of a chance.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.824
What does that mean?

11:34.868 --> 11:37.131
[Harald]
You're the second wife.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.916
Second wives
don't matter very much.

11:39.960 --> 11:40.961
They are an afterthought.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.747
And Gunnhild is pregnant
with his child.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.188
What do you want
to say to me?

11:53.930 --> 11:56.019
I want to say to you
what you already know.

11:57.629 --> 11:58.761
You're in love with Bjorn.

12:00.502 --> 12:01.721
[chuckles] Maybe.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.680
But I recognize
something in you.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.596
You're ambitious.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.816
But Bjorn is not the King.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.123
I am married to Bjorn.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.690
Bjorn is my destiny.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.867
How can you guess
your destiny?

12:23.003 --> 12:25.962
If you want,
and if you are truly ambitious,

12:27.921 --> 12:29.749
I will make you Queen
of all Norway.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.230
You don't know me.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.104
I'm sure I would enjoy
getting to know you.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.019
[chuckles]

12:39.062 --> 12:41.456
So, we have just met

12:41.499 --> 12:43.850
and already you want me
to betray my husband.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.505
The best fruit
is always forbidden.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.860
I'm only asking you
to think about my suggestion.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.348
[clicks tongue]

13:06.133 --> 13:07.351
[Viking] Heave!

13:12.879 --> 13:13.836
[Gunnhild grunts]

13:14.968 --> 13:16.839
[breathing heavily]

13:22.671 --> 13:23.846
[groans]

13:23.890 --> 13:25.805
[screams]

13:26.718 --> 13:27.763
[Erik] Gunnhild?

13:29.765 --> 13:32.942
Ah! My baby! My baby!

13:35.379 --> 13:37.468
[crying hysterically]

13:46.782 --> 13:48.088
My baby!

13:48.131 --> 13:49.524
[crying hysterically]

13:50.612 --> 13:52.309
[screams]

13:56.748 --> 13:58.794
[Gunnhild] It was a boy.
Of course.

14:01.144 --> 14:01.884
I'm sorry.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.801
I know it is what you wanted,

14:05.845 --> 14:06.976
so I am sorry, too.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.938
But it is the judgment
of the gods.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.983
Perhaps I am not meant
to have a child with you.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.335
Don't say that.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.729
We will have children.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.383
[Gunnhild] Perhaps Ingrid
will give you a son.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.082
[Bjorn] I wanted our son.

14:35.135 --> 14:37.311
I want only
what is best for you, Gunnhild.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.013
I admire you
more than I can say.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.844
I also weep
for your dead son.

14:50.672 --> 14:51.586
Thank you.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.722
[sighs]

14:57.766 --> 14:58.985
This is a sad day.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.770
We lost a child.

15:04.381 --> 15:07.645
But it would be far worse
to lose a country.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.256
That should be
all our care now.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.825
[Ingrid] And it is
your care, Bjorn.

15:15.218 --> 15:16.654
You are the true King.

15:16.698 --> 15:17.829
You know that.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.051
You are the true King
of Norway.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.674
[indistinct talking]

15:39.025 --> 15:40.809
[Katia] I hope
you haven't forgotten.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.463
I don't usually
do such things.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.813
I risked my life.
You do know that, don't you?

15:44.856 --> 15:46.119
[Ivar] And I don't know why.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.036
You told me that
we knew each other before.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.428
In an earlier life.

15:51.472 --> 15:52.952
But you did not believe me.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.173
I was afraid.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.525
But such things can happen.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.180
In our religion,
we believe that.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.053
Life is ultimately unknowable.

16:10.099 --> 16:13.189
I was contacted recently
by someone I love very much.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.062
A dear friend
of my mother's.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.107
She gave me
some very good news.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.156
She told me that Prince Dir
was alive and well...

16:24.418 --> 16:25.462
thanks to you.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.466
You helped him escape, no?

16:34.080 --> 16:37.518
How would I know such things
if I were not on his side?

16:37.561 --> 16:40.825
I do not love Oleg.
Surely you know that?

16:40.869 --> 16:44.699
I gave myself to you.
I risked everything.

16:44.742 --> 16:48.137
Now, why would I have
done that if I were
happy in my marriage?

16:48.181 --> 16:52.011
I'm not happy in my marriage.
I'm looking for an escape.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.368
We need to talk
some more, Katia.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.719
Thank you for being honest.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.253
I think I'm falling in love
with you.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.127
And I don't even know
who you are.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.588
What did she say?

17:53.202 --> 17:54.290
I'm not sure.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.211
[birds chirping]

18:06.172 --> 18:08.087
Look, it's spring.

18:12.613 --> 18:13.570
[sobs]

18:13.614 --> 18:16.051
[in Old Norse]

18:53.088 --> 18:54.611
[sobbing]

19:19.462 --> 19:22.161
[sobbing]

19:35.826 --> 19:38.177
[indistinct talking]

19:51.973 --> 19:53.844
Bjorn Ironside,

19:53.888 --> 19:59.546
I want to drink to your
beautiful wife, Gunnhild.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.637
I'm so sorry
that you lost your child.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.475
Thank you, King Harald.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.265
[softly] Only Jarl Thorkell
and a few others

20:23.309 --> 20:25.398
have answered
King Harald's summons.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.096
It is not enough.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.055
Send word out to the others,

20:31.099 --> 20:32.448
but don't do it
in King Harald's name.

20:32.492 --> 20:33.536
Do it in my name.

20:34.450 --> 20:35.712
Do it quickly.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.368
When do you suppose
the Rus will attack?

20:42.545 --> 20:44.808
It wouldn't surprise me
if they were already at sea.

20:48.377 --> 20:50.249
[Harald] Isn't she beautiful?

20:51.467 --> 20:52.903
Don't you agree, Olaf?

20:55.558 --> 20:56.951
That may be.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.388
But such things
mean nothing now.

21:00.476 --> 21:04.001
You already see the gray hair,

21:04.045 --> 21:06.526
the balding scalp,

21:06.569 --> 21:09.398
and the grinning skull beneath.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.539
Bjorn is married to
the strongest,

21:19.582 --> 21:22.977
most beautiful,
most fascinating

21:23.020 --> 21:24.805
shield-maiden in the world.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.330
And I don't understand why

21:28.374 --> 21:30.550
he has to take another wife.

21:30.593 --> 21:34.815
Why he has to take
everything for himself.

21:34.858 --> 21:38.035
Well, perhaps because he can.

22:02.059 --> 22:03.365
[Harald] Let her go.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.586
Don't hurt her. Let her go.

22:11.591 --> 22:12.418
You stay.

22:15.595 --> 22:16.335
[sighs]

22:17.336 --> 22:18.641
What do you want?

22:18.685 --> 22:19.773
You.

22:21.644 --> 22:22.341
[sniffs]

22:27.998 --> 22:29.086
[sighs]

22:30.610 --> 22:31.611
What are you afraid of?

22:32.481 --> 22:33.439
You.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.268
[exhales]

22:38.487 --> 22:40.402
I want to go.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.883
-You have to let me go.
-I don't have to do anything.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.145
I'm the King.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.061
[whispers] If Bjorn
finds out...

22:47.104 --> 22:48.497
He won't find out.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.108
You won't tell him.

22:51.935 --> 22:53.807
It will be our secret.

22:53.850 --> 22:56.636
And if the Rus attack,

22:56.679 --> 23:00.291
then either Bjorn or I,
or probably both of us,
will die.

23:02.119 --> 23:05.253
And if I die,
our secret goes to the grave.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.297
And if Bjorn dies,

23:07.255 --> 23:09.823
I promise to marry you

23:09.866 --> 23:12.303
and make you
Queen of all Norway.

23:13.043 --> 23:14.697
Then let's wait.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.351
See what happens.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.483
What the gods have in store.

23:17.526 --> 23:19.572
No. I'm tired of waiting
for the gods.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.618
They never listen.
I want you now.

23:22.662 --> 23:23.793
I want you now.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.055
[grunting]

23:29.495 --> 23:30.496
[grunts]

23:34.674 --> 23:36.850
[breathing heavily]

23:38.721 --> 23:41.289
-To hell with Bjorn.
-[sobs]

23:41.332 --> 23:43.291
Go on, then. Do it!

24:04.965 --> 24:05.966
[Bjorn] Are we ready?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.756
I'll go check
on the other defenses.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.717
[Erik] I see something.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.421
[Bjorn] Perhaps it is
King Hakon
or one of the others.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.119
No.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.428
This is it.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.534
We will meet again, husband.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.237
[exhales]

25:08.942 --> 25:10.596
[horn blowing]

25:17.820 --> 25:19.735
[man calling out]

25:43.629 --> 25:44.978
[seagulls squawking]

25:53.552 --> 25:55.641
[sings in Old Norse]

26:40.120 --> 26:43.689
[Ivar] This is where
we will attack.

26:43.732 --> 26:46.866
Here is the mouth of the river
leading into Harald's capital.

26:48.128 --> 26:50.347
No doubt Bjorn will block it.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.785
As well as planning
other surprises.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.787
The famous Bjorn Ironside.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.660
Are you certain
he'll be there?

27:08.583 --> 27:10.063
[Ivar] Yes.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.891
I can assure you,
beyond any doubt,

27:11.934 --> 27:13.283
that our brother will be there.

27:15.416 --> 27:16.983
So, we should
attack the beach.

27:18.506 --> 27:19.725
Won't they expect that?

27:19.768 --> 27:21.944
Of course they will. Yes.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.685
But they will not
expect us to know

27:23.729 --> 27:26.340
that the beach shelves
steeply and quickly,

27:26.383 --> 27:28.472
and that our ships

27:28.516 --> 27:30.692
will capsize
if they get too close.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.389
Which is why

27:32.433 --> 27:34.957
we will bring
these smaller barges with us,

27:35.001 --> 27:37.568
transfer our warriors
into them and simply...

27:40.920 --> 27:42.312
-[clamoring]
-[horse neighing]

27:43.749 --> 27:45.315
Storm the beach.

27:51.757 --> 27:52.758
[man calling out]

28:38.238 --> 28:39.239
What are they doing?

28:41.720 --> 28:42.808
What I expected.

29:01.957 --> 29:05.874
It seems the gods brought us
together again, my brother.

29:08.442 --> 29:11.271
They must enjoy
seeing us fight.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.709
I don't blame them.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.929
I enjoy it, too.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.541
You cannot speak
for the gods.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.196
Only for yourself.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.680
If you say so, Bjorn.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.900
After all,
you're my elder brother.
You know better.

29:35.904 --> 29:39.342
I know better than
to attack my own people
with a Christian army.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.349
I like being
on the winning side.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.922
[Bjorn] If you
betray our gods,

29:55.315 --> 29:56.925
then you also
betray our father.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.806
Our father chose me
above all of you.

30:14.682 --> 30:15.857
That is not true.

30:18.991 --> 30:22.255
He asked me first
to go with him to Wessex.

30:22.298 --> 30:25.084
And then he asked Hvitserk
and then Sigurd.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.828
It was only after
we all refused

30:31.090 --> 30:31.917
that he turned to you.

30:33.483 --> 30:34.310
He knew.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.705
He knew that
you would all refuse him.

30:40.186 --> 30:41.622
He knew that you would all...

30:42.928 --> 30:43.972
disown him.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.323
He knew that

30:47.367 --> 30:49.804
I would be the only one
to remain loyal.

30:51.371 --> 30:53.329
[Bjorn] We all loved him.

30:53.373 --> 30:56.898
None of us wanted
to accompany him
on a journey to his death.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.467
We were more interested
in preserving his legacy,

31:00.510 --> 31:01.860
which is what we have done.

31:06.386 --> 31:07.909
His real legacy...

31:10.346 --> 31:11.652
is safe with me.

31:15.786 --> 31:19.834
If you really believe
that our father's legacy
is to defeat our gods...

31:27.973 --> 31:29.235
then you are wrong, Ivar.

31:32.847 --> 31:33.892
And I'll prove it.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.439
[all shouting]

32:02.181 --> 32:03.182
Charge!

32:04.444 --> 32:07.012

34:12.485 --> 34:15.140
Oh, my poor child.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.319

Oh, my poor child.

34:23.278 --> 34:24.975

-Weep.

34:25.019 --> 34:26.760
Weep for all of us.

34:26.803 --> 34:30.111
My poor child.
Weep for our ruin.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.288

34:33.332 --> 34:34.724
Oh, my poor thing.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.074
My poor baby.

34:50.436 --> 34:52.612
Why can't we attack there?

34:55.223 --> 34:57.182
That river leads
into the mountains.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.748
It's an impossible barrier.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.231
Vikings! Prepare to fight!

35:47.841 --> 35:49.277
[shouting indistinctly]

We will sail up the river...

40:54.756 --> 40:56.715
to here.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.587
And as you can see,
the mountain is
a formidable obstacle,

41:01.589 --> 41:02.677
but we shall climb it.

41:03.983 --> 41:06.507
And on the other side...

41:06.551 --> 41:08.770
is King Harald's
unsuspecting capital.

41:11.599 --> 41:13.688
Are you going
to climb the mountain?

41:15.560 --> 41:16.561
Of course!

41:16.604 --> 41:17.823
How?

But this time
I will not fail.

45:33.643 --> 45:34.775
I will win.

45:38.387 --> 45:39.693
The gods are with me.

45:43.828 --> 45:45.177
I will defeat you.

45:51.836 --> 45:52.837
You are wrong.

The gods abandoned you
a long time ago, my brother.

There is no way
you can win.
