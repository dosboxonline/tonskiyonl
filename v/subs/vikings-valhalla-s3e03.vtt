00:06.006 --> 00:10.385
-

00:41.833 --> 00:45.170
Harald! Harald!

00:45.795 --> 00:48.840
This is what glory looks like, my friends!

00:59.684 --> 01:00.643
What? Hey!

01:03.146 --> 01:06.483
A hero's welcome! Come on! Ease your mind!

01:44.062 --> 01:46.272
Harald!

01:52.320 --> 01:58.076
Almighty Ruler,
assign these soldiers to Your Holy Angels,

01:58.159 --> 02:04.457
guard them with Your strength,
and keep them under Your protection.

02:04.541 --> 02:08.294
- Amen!
- Amen!

02:20.974 --> 02:24.978
Today, we welcome back
our beloved army…

02:25.895 --> 02:30.483
and celebrate their overwhelming victory
in Sicily!

02:33.611 --> 02:36.990
The victory of your sons,

02:37.824 --> 02:42.328
sons of the mightiest people in the world,

02:42.412 --> 02:45.498
the people of Constantinople.

02:45.582 --> 02:50.378
An Empire that stretches
from the Alps to Asia!

02:58.052 --> 03:02.849
Now I present my wife, the Empress Zoe.

03:12.483 --> 03:17.322
Georgios Maniakes… and Harald Sigurdsson,

03:18.114 --> 03:20.992
you are true sons of Constantinople.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.870
And we are in your debt.

03:24.954 --> 03:28.583
As a reward
for your triumphant actions in Sicily,

03:28.666 --> 03:35.256
we bestow upon you the title,
Spatharokandidatos,

03:35.340 --> 03:41.846
the highest honor of an Imperial Warrior,
a status signified by your new armor.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.602
Behold your heroes!

04:53.918 --> 04:55.420
You are back.

05:21.362 --> 05:22.697
I've come for William.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.284
I am his kinsman.
You have no right to claim him.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.996
I have the authority of the Duke,
who left him in my care.

05:31.497 --> 05:35.668
His father is dead! He is
the Duke now. He belongs with his family.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.212
You care only for his title.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.256
He goes nowhere.

05:48.389 --> 05:51.100
Get up, William.
You're coming home with me.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.771
Will… it's Alfred.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.566
You told me to wake you when they arrived.

05:59.150 --> 05:59.984
They're here!

06:09.827 --> 06:11.329
You had your nightmare again?

06:17.293 --> 06:19.962
Well, you're about to meet my nightmare.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.032
Close the gates!

06:48.116 --> 06:49.784
- My dear sister…
- Richard.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.413
- King Canute…
- Richard.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.124
Welcome to my home.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.000
It is good to be here.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.878
I trust your journey to Rome
was a fruitful one?

07:01.879 --> 07:02.713
It was.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.715
Though, exhausting.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.385
It is good to be so close to home.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.470
I am anxious to see the boys.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.932
- Mother!
- Alfred!

07:16.352 --> 07:17.728
Oh, you've grown.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.647
I've been away too long.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.525
How was Rome? Did you meet the Pope?

07:22.608 --> 07:25.570
I did. Let me tell you all about it.

07:26.654 --> 07:27.947
Where's your brother?

07:28.030 --> 07:29.240
I'm here.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.702
Right where you left me years ago.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.747
Edward, you should properly greet
the King of England.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.044
My Lord… it's been a long time.

07:43.004 --> 07:43.838
It has.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.093
And you are just as courteous
as I remember.

07:53.514 --> 07:57.935
Your Highness, may I introduce to you
William, the Duke of Normandy.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.771
Your Highnesses. Welcome to Normandy.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.568
William, you don't remember me,
but I am your great-aunt, Emma.

08:06.152 --> 08:10.698
And I am the Duke's guardian, Walter,
his mother's brother.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.619
I rule for him
until he reaches his majority.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.704
It is a pleasure to meet Your Majesties.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.048
I want to expand more
of our wool trade…

08:27.131 --> 08:29.509
- Go with Alfred.
- …to the continent.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.552
To your rooms! This way.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.720
- Mother.
- Thank you.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.306
Who better than our Norman cousins
to help us?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.976
Normandy has no need for English wool.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.186
It's not what I heard.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.647
Well, maybe you heard wrong.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.151
Maybe we should ask His Grace
to see what he thinks.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.989
William, you seem like
a thoughtful young man.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.869
Perhaps I should wait a year
for your ascendancy,

08:56.953 --> 08:58.704
and then hold trade talks with you.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.458
My uncle speaks for me.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.214
Now, if England were to lower
the price on their wool,

09:08.297 --> 09:10.174
then it's possible Normandy will need it.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.093
He's grown fat and rich off the boy.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.303
England does not need
to lower the price.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.515
He controls Normandy now.
He's bleeding it dry.

09:17.598 --> 09:21.352
William will soon be 15.
He can reclaim his power then.

09:21.936 --> 09:26.691
More likely, he'll suffer an accident
at the hands of his trusted guardian.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.360
And the Duchy will become Walter's.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.282
Sadly, I'm afraid the blood of Rollo
runs thin in his veins.

09:35.783 --> 09:36.617
Perhaps.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.038
Or perhaps he's waiting for his time.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.165
What about you?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.334
That is because
we believe in our people…

09:45.418 --> 09:49.630
I'm thinking about my sons
and what will become of them.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.842
Tell your stepfather
what you have seen there.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.927
Norman wool is excellent,
Your Highness.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.596
I'm thinking about the future.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.307
…opportunities for trade
between England and Normandy.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.601
See?
He knows what he is talking about.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.065
Husband!

10:50.316 --> 10:53.444
Gytha! What are you doing here?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.072
I thought you were in Roskilde.

10:56.155 --> 11:00.076
I was, but I didn't want to miss
the Midsummer celebrations.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.288
- Father!
- Harold! Tostig!

11:04.830 --> 11:06.582
What has brought you here?

11:06.666 --> 11:10.169
Canute asked me to deliver the terms
of his agreement in Rome to his father.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.879
Forkbeard is not here.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.881
He and grandmother went to the waterfall

11:13.964 --> 11:16.175
to make offerings for the Landvættir.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.802
What's that? A church?

11:17.885 --> 11:22.598
No. Landvættir are the spirits
that protect this land.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.684
Here I thought you were all
God-fearing Christians.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.728
Come, I want you to meet someone.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.775
Harefoot! Come out and meet my husband.

11:39.323 --> 11:42.701
Husband, this is Prince Harald Harefoot,
King Canute's son.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.956
Harefoot, this is my husband, Earl Godwin.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.876
Godwin, you are just the man
I wish to see.

11:51.877 --> 11:52.711
Really?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.214
And you are naked.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.513
Come in!

12:13.732 --> 12:18.571
I've been told by Gytha
that you have my father's ear.

12:20.489 --> 12:24.034
And that is good because
I wish to be the next King of England.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.500
England?

12:35.504 --> 12:39.341
You are aware there are others
ahead of you in the line of succession.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.261
Your brother Svein,
Canute and Emma's son, Harthacanute,

12:42.344 --> 12:45.514
and her children from her first marriage
to Æthelred, Edward and Alfred.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.224
I'm not worried about them.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.809
But perhaps you should be.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.604
Which is why I need your help.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.609
So tell me, what do I need to do
to make this happen?

12:59.236 --> 13:01.363
Well, clothes would be an excellent start.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.837
Why are you not
with your friends,

13:16.921 --> 13:19.089
receiving the Emperor's praise?

13:26.096 --> 13:31.477
Because I was responsible for something
that should not be celebrated.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.594
What are you saying?

14:07.012 --> 14:07.846
Knowledge.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.977
I spent seven years hunting for it.

14:14.436 --> 14:15.563
And I lost myself.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.342
What are you going to do?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.388
Find the last place I knew who I was.

15:03.819 --> 15:04.737
Empress.

15:12.202 --> 15:15.122
I don't think I've ever seen
so much gold in one place!

15:15.873 --> 15:18.918
That's because you've never been
inside the Imperial Palace before.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.837
- Empress.
- Empress.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.050
It's good to see you all. Where is Leif?

15:26.133 --> 15:28.969
Uh, we have not seen him
since the entry into the city.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.554
He is Leif.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.223
He still plots his own course.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.101
I can't even remember
the Elena we knew on the Dnieper.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.856
Neither can I. But I can remember
the good times we had there.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.774
So do I.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.442
Empress.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.196
Spatharokandidatos.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.163
You look beautiful.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.999
Marriage becomes you.

16:00.709 --> 16:01.919
With all your victories…

16:03.087 --> 16:05.673
do you still wish to return
to Norway to be king?

16:06.507 --> 16:10.678
My desires have never wavered.
It is my destiny.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.348
Destinies can change.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.191
What is this? Harald!

16:25.567 --> 16:28.320
Spatharokandidatos, you must come with us.

17:09.403 --> 17:13.532
Forgive the intrigue,
but no one can know where this place is.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.708
Can I trust you, Harald Sigurdsson?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.335
I believe I have earned that trust.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.589
Then enter the Emperor's vault.

17:30.632 --> 17:34.553
The treasure from centuries of conquests.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.307
I've never seen anything so magnificent.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.268
It is not for you to behold.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.896
It is for you to take.

17:45.314 --> 17:49.860
A tradition that goes back
hundreds of years to the conquering hero.

17:50.611 --> 17:54.656
Anything in these rooms can be yours.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.786
But, as in life…

18:01.246 --> 18:04.166
you are only given
a limited amount of time.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.799
Come, Zoe.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.551
Let us allow Harald to choose.

18:35.489 --> 18:39.535
You don't have to choose.
You can have everything.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.181
The queen's power is growing stronger.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.893
I'm sure sending me here
as messenger was her idea.

19:06.728 --> 19:07.771
And now Harefoot?

19:09.565 --> 19:10.566
King of England?

19:11.900 --> 19:12.901
Are you finished?

19:17.531 --> 19:21.368
Canute will always need you.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.955
You just need to remind him of that
every once in a while.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.292
And you are no longer his servant.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.335
You're family.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.172
I don't know.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.175
There's something different this time…

19:37.009 --> 19:37.885
about Emma.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.344
Hm? Ow.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.223
Stop talking about Emma.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.763
- Wends!
- Wends!

20:25.766 --> 20:28.060
We're under attack! Run!

20:32.773 --> 20:33.899
Wends!

20:33.982 --> 20:36.151
Get the boys,
stay in the center of the ring!

20:36.235 --> 20:38.570
Tostig! Harold!

21:16.066 --> 21:17.150
No!

21:46.305 --> 21:47.180
Gytha!

22:11.121 --> 22:12.247
Gytha!

22:12.831 --> 22:14.750
Go!

22:35.312 --> 22:36.188
Mother!

22:54.539 --> 22:55.791
My brother.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.528
I have stored it all. You could now buy
two armies with what you have.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.908
That's still the plan?

23:32.994 --> 23:34.621
I've not forgotten my goals.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.706
I'm glad.

23:39.042 --> 23:43.630
I really thought Romanos was going to
throw you in jail for talking to Zoe.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.843
Don't worry about me, Kaysan.

23:49.886 --> 23:50.804
Tell me…

23:52.889 --> 23:53.974
Have you seen Leif?

23:55.016 --> 23:56.560
Not since we entered the city.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.021
Shall I try to find him?

24:01.356 --> 24:02.190
No.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.485
I will.

24:23.378 --> 24:24.212
Leif!

24:29.342 --> 24:30.177
Leif?

24:33.221 --> 24:34.306
What are you doing?

24:49.738 --> 24:51.156
This is what you fought for.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.368
Everywhere we went,
these were your rewards.

24:55.452 --> 24:58.455
I intended to use the knowledge
to make the world better.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.416
I have used it to make it worse.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.962
Leif, what happened in Syracuse
was not your fault.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.298
Then whose was it?

25:09.549 --> 25:12.886
Who found that the elements
could be blended to yield such a fire?

25:14.012 --> 25:16.681
Who designed a way
for that horror to be delivered?

25:27.734 --> 25:28.944
What would Mariam think?

25:29.027 --> 25:31.780
She… would be disappointed.

26:24.749 --> 26:28.545
Yes. The last.

26:30.672 --> 26:31.840
<i>The last.</i>

26:32.590 --> 26:35.135
<i>There is no going back from here.</i>

26:36.386 --> 26:37.721
<i>You are the last…</i>

26:40.015 --> 26:41.808
<i>The last daughter of Uppsala.</i>

26:42.058 --> 26:44.519
<i>You must survive.</i>

26:49.566 --> 26:50.400
Harald!

26:50.483 --> 26:53.069
He's still alive. Stígr is with him.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.201
Freydis…

27:17.385 --> 27:18.303
How is he?

27:19.137 --> 27:20.138
He's strong.

27:21.723 --> 27:22.974
Like his mother.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.435
Praise the gods. You're up.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.146
We were afraid we'd lost you.

27:30.565 --> 27:34.611
Just stay, stay.
The gods are looking after you.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.616
How many have we lost?

27:41.034 --> 27:42.035
At least half.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.080
Most of the old ones and…

27:46.373 --> 27:49.000
the healthy who survived are weak.

28:00.053 --> 28:03.264
The poison was in the flour
we traded for in Kattegat.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.225
It's a brilliant strategy.

28:07.227 --> 28:11.106
You made Jomsborg so difficult to attack
that they had to discover a new way.

28:11.898 --> 28:12.899
But who did it?

28:12.982 --> 28:14.943
I think we'll find out soon.

28:15.026 --> 28:18.029
Whoever did this must be curious
to see if their plan worked.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.198
And we must be ready when they arrive.

28:21.282 --> 28:23.827
Ready? For what, Freydis?

28:24.536 --> 28:28.081
We've only a handful of warriors
who could fight and everyone is weak.

28:29.082 --> 28:29.916
We could leave.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.293
Before they arrive.

28:33.336 --> 28:37.757
And go where? On all sides
we are surrounded by Christians.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.395
I got your message.

28:55.692 --> 28:59.487
Everything we've done
from the beginning of our friendship,

28:59.571 --> 29:00.989
we've always done together.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.033
London Bridge…

29:05.243 --> 29:06.119
Kattegat…

29:07.746 --> 29:08.747
The Dnieper.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.168
I do not want to say goodbye.

29:14.043 --> 29:16.421
Our friendship hasn't changed, Harald.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.048
But I have.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.555
Where I am going, I won't need this.

29:28.558 --> 29:29.893
I want you to have it.

29:32.061 --> 29:34.147
Like me, it will always
tell you the truth.

29:34.647 --> 29:36.524
But it only works if you use it.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.570
May it remind you
of how you came this far.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.993
You're the greatest navigator I ever met.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.080
May you find now what you're looking for.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.566
Should have seen it coming.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.653
You cannot blame yourself, Freydis.

31:04.571 --> 31:07.574
Yes, I can. I am the chosen one.

31:09.576 --> 31:12.537
I was shown a vision
of a new home for my people.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.165
I fought for control of this place.

31:16.249 --> 31:20.086
I killed Olaf and other enemies
who tried to destroy it, and…

31:25.049 --> 31:25.967
And now…

31:27.844 --> 31:29.971
when I need the gods' help the most…

31:32.140 --> 31:33.933
they have robbed me of my strength.

31:35.351 --> 31:37.478
Maybe because they don't
want you to fight.

31:38.187 --> 31:39.731
But that is who I am.

31:39.814 --> 31:42.817
What I mean is maybe this is not
the final home to fight for.

31:44.277 --> 31:46.905
Maybe the place you're meant to be
is somewhere else.

31:48.656 --> 31:49.490
Where?

31:50.325 --> 31:52.619
Perhaps Greenland. Your people are there.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.455
There are no trees in Greenland, it's…

31:56.497 --> 31:57.749
It's not the place I saw.

31:58.625 --> 32:02.337
I do not have the answer.
Freydis, only you do.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.673
But I can tell you there is a lot of world
we know nothing about.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.384
It lies over the horizon,

32:08.468 --> 32:10.762
and it is revealed only for those

32:10.845 --> 32:13.514
with the reason to find it
and the bravery to seek it.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.113
Harald!

32:31.032 --> 32:32.033
Harald!

32:49.509 --> 32:50.677
Something bothers you.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.640
My sons…

32:58.559 --> 32:59.727
They're strangers.

33:04.899 --> 33:11.322
Alfred is the same but… Edward resents me
for sending them here to Normandy.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.450
Had you left them in England
while I was gone…

33:17.912 --> 33:19.247
they would have been in danger.

33:23.209 --> 33:27.088
Even our marriage would not
have protected them.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.215
You knew that.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.637
But I could have brought them back
when you returned.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.305
And I didn't.

33:40.518 --> 33:41.519
Edward hates me.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.315
Because I married you.

33:48.317 --> 33:49.152
For me.

33:55.199 --> 34:00.872
That savage stole our father's crown.
By rights I should be king now.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.291
He spared our lives.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.961
You call this a life?
I'm a king without a kingdom.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.132
I will raise an army of Normans
and land in England.

34:11.215 --> 34:12.925
You'd be making a mistake.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.056
You're not ready.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.059
You need to bide your time.

34:21.142 --> 34:24.896
Never let your enemy see you as a threat.
Let them forget you're even there!

34:26.314 --> 34:29.275
Is that what you're doing?
Always agreeing with Walter?

34:29.817 --> 34:30.818
Yes.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.571
And as God is my witness,

34:33.654 --> 34:36.699
when the time comes,
I will take what is mine!

34:37.366 --> 34:38.493
Brave talk.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.628
I swear it.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.131
Will you?

35:34.090 --> 35:35.842
To taking back what's ours.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.679
To choosing the moment.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.463
Are those Olaf's colors?

36:15.798 --> 36:16.632
Yes.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.426
But you killed him.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.471
He had a son. Magnus.

36:23.764 --> 36:27.852
If we had even a dozen warriors,
we could sink them easily.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.855
He knows we do not.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.107
So what do we do?

36:35.484 --> 36:36.485
We leave Jomsborg.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.615
Leave? It's too late!

36:40.698 --> 36:43.743
No. Magnus did not bring a fleet

36:43.826 --> 36:46.037
because he thinks
the battle is already over.

36:46.120 --> 36:50.124
He's right. All he'll have to fight
is an army of dead Jomsvikings.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.501
Exactly.

36:53.419 --> 36:55.213
That is enough to defeat him.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.869
Do not go back to Norway.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.038
Here is where your future is.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.958
All you have to do…

38:19.755 --> 38:21.215
is take it.
