WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.436
[Ragnar]
Previously on Vikings...

00:02.470 --> 00:03.671
We should sail west.

00:03.704 --> 00:05.039
Can't sail across
an open ocean.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.040
I believe there's a way.

00:06.074 --> 00:07.775
-Whoa!
-[shouting]

00:07.808 --> 00:09.243
[laughs]

00:12.713 --> 00:13.847
We can sail west again.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.683
I have to find that land.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.585
Otherwise, my life,
it is filled with no meaning.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.922
We will need their help
if we are to survive here.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.891
[Naad] Where?
Where is the gold?

00:23.924 --> 00:26.127
Very soon,
all of this will be ours.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.429
Everyone will always
underestimate you.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.897
You must make them pay for it.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.465
I will, Father.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.000
Be ruthless.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.136
Whenever they come,
they'll have to pass through
those trees.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.105
And when they do,
we'll be waiting for them.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.439
[yelling]

00:38.472 --> 00:40.274
My Lord, do we
go back or forward?

00:40.308 --> 00:42.009
Soldiers, advance!

00:42.042 --> 00:43.344
[yelling]

00:46.013 --> 00:47.481
My Lord, I beg you--

00:47.515 --> 00:49.317
If you heard my command,
we shall not retreat.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.752
[speaks native tongue]

00:51.785 --> 00:53.020
[Ivar] One day, I will die.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.622
But when they dig up my bones,

00:54.655 --> 00:55.656
I want them to say,

00:55.689 --> 00:56.890
"Here is the grave...

00:58.359 --> 01:01.162
of the most famous Viking
who ever lived."

01:01.195 --> 01:02.029
[yells]

01:03.864 --> 01:04.865
Ragnar.

01:04.898 --> 01:05.866
Crazy man.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.036
[laughs]

01:09.069 --> 01:10.704
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:10.738 --> 01:16.744
* More, give me more
Give me more *

01:20.080 --> 01:25.553
* If I had a heart
I could love you *

01:25.586 --> 01:29.390
* If I had a voice
I would sing *

01:31.759 --> 01:36.130
* After the night
When I wake up *

01:36.164 --> 01:41.369
* I'll see
What tomorrow brings *

01:41.402 --> 01:48.376
[vocalizing]

01:48.409 --> 01:52.346
* If I had a voice
I would sing *

02:08.896 --> 02:09.997
Ubbe?

02:14.668 --> 02:15.803
Ubbe.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.439
Son of Ragnar.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.179
And Torvi.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.518
I remember.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.086
[Torvi] I can't
believe it's you.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.055
Dear Floki.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.663
I don't remember you.

02:43.564 --> 02:44.698
Forgive me.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.635
His name is Naad.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.303
And your name is Othere.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.807
I remember you, don't I?

02:53.841 --> 02:56.977
Yes, indeed, Floki.
Yes, indeed.

03:00.881 --> 03:04.385
[both laugh]

03:04.418 --> 03:06.854
[Floki] Come, Ubbe. Come.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.422
-Let's sit down.
-[Ubbe] I'd love to.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.758
[Floki speaks Mi'kmaq]

03:14.295 --> 03:17.231
These people have
always taken care of me.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.833
I wouldn't have survived
without them.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.169
When I arrived here,
I was weak,

03:22.202 --> 03:24.204
unable to stand on my own feet.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.540
A gibbering fool.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.612
They tended to the sickness
of my body

03:32.446 --> 03:33.547
and my spirit.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.585
They healed me.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.053
As far as that was possible.
[chuckles]

03:41.922 --> 03:42.923
Why did you leave Iceland?

03:44.525 --> 03:45.593
There are so many stories.

03:47.695 --> 03:51.532
I left when the sadness
became too much.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.802
I was overwhelmed.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.806
I was imprisoned in sadness.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.377
I felt deserted by the gods.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.681
I called to them,

04:09.116 --> 04:11.118
but I no longer
heard their voices.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.988
The world made no sense.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.828
Everything I once
thought of as real

04:22.330 --> 04:23.831
was beginning to melt

04:25.699 --> 04:27.167
and disfigure,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.271
to change its shape.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.777
And I was sick once more
to my very soul.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.682
And so I found a boat.

04:43.517 --> 04:47.355
Being a Viking, as I still was,

04:47.388 --> 04:49.790
I was always
able to find a boat.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.761
What made you so sad?

05:14.615 --> 05:15.916
I don't...

05:17.250 --> 05:18.786
I don't always remember.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.458
Things slip my mind.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.335
But you could ask him.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.406
You could ask Othere.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.356
-[men grunt]
-[horse neighs]

05:56.390 --> 05:58.592
[Saxon guard] Stand to!
Gather your weapons!

05:58.626 --> 06:00.227
Let him through.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.529
[horse neighs]

06:07.401 --> 06:08.469
-[horse whinnies]
-Hyah.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.410
[drums beating]

06:20.814 --> 06:22.550
[Ivar grunting]

06:22.583 --> 06:24.652
[drums continue beating]

06:31.825 --> 06:33.427
[inhales deeply]

06:33.461 --> 06:34.294
[spits]

06:37.631 --> 06:38.766
Greetings.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.477
You taught me
how to play the game.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.981
[Alfred] You play the game
very well, Ivar.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.151
It's been a long time.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.121
Our fathers died.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.389
We both became kings.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.094
But we are still fighting
like our fathers did.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.964
I have a hope that
there will be an end to this

07:10.998 --> 07:13.333
endless cycle
of suffering and war.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.375
I agree.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.079
So I propose, for your sake,

07:26.113 --> 07:28.682
that we end this battle now
and we make peace.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.519
Exchange hostages.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.186
Negotiate in good faith.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.024
We live to fight another day.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.829
What do you say?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.849
I have to reject
your offer of peace.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.955
You came here,
uninvited, unwanted.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.992
And now you only sue for peace
because you fear to lose.

08:12.025 --> 08:17.330
You don't really want peace,
do you, Ivar the Boneless?

08:17.364 --> 08:20.634
You are a byword for terror
all over this world.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.737
You do not see or feel
the pity of ordinary mortals.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.839
No.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.141
You merely want a respite
so you can regroup.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.645
Perhaps summon some
other Northmen to your aid.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.514
Your only desire
is to kill and to triumph.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.717
My god is the god
of peace and love,

08:36.750 --> 08:38.185
but your gods are savage.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.220
They demand sacrifice.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.823
For them, human love
is unknowable and weak.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.526
And you think me weak.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.096
And pliable and cowardly.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.934
But, alas for you,
you are totally wrong.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.938
Your gods have misled you.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.340
They believe that death
always triumphs over life.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.110
But it is not so.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.613
Just as winter
brings universal death,

09:05.646 --> 09:07.748
so spring
always brings eternal life.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.617
And the sun also rises.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.058
So, that's a "no"?

09:18.091 --> 09:20.060
Oh, I wasn't sure.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.930
I thought you had
more of a Christian care
for your poor warriors.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.805
[sighs] Alfred,

09:34.675 --> 09:35.943
you're outnumbered.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.379
The last of Wessex.

09:41.849 --> 09:42.983
Ivar...

09:43.817 --> 09:45.185
[sighs]

09:45.218 --> 09:47.487
I have such a care
for my poor warriors

09:47.520 --> 09:49.256
that I refuse to submit them

09:49.289 --> 09:51.825
to your subterfuges
and your tyranny.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.964
They live or die
for the love of God

09:56.997 --> 09:58.531
and for their own land.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.769
Why don't you just leave?

10:03.536 --> 10:04.537
Abandon the battle.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.376
Save your own people.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.561
The die is cast.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.284
[panting]

11:05.966 --> 11:08.335
[Ubbe] What made Floki so sad?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.340
[Othere] The ways of men.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.709
The dark blood of revenge
blighted his dream

11:15.743 --> 11:17.711
and made him question
not only the gods,

11:17.745 --> 11:19.012
but also himself.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.150
The old ways.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.753
The dark blood. Exactly.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.859
What do you see when you look
at this new world?

11:38.899 --> 11:41.034
I see endless possibilities.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.271
I see a golden landscape.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.907
[Othere] Hmm.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.676
Rich farming soil, minerals,

11:49.709 --> 11:53.613
rivers, ports,
construction, abundance.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.983
Everything that
Ragnar dreamed of.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.419
Everything he dreamed of

11:59.452 --> 12:02.122
the first time
he sailed away from Kattegat.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.892
This is what
he was searching for.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.529
And I found it.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.465
[laughs]

12:12.499 --> 12:14.334
[Othere] In this new world,

12:14.367 --> 12:16.837
do you really want
to live in the old ways?

12:18.105 --> 12:20.140
You discover a new land,

12:20.173 --> 12:26.079
but you behave in the same ways
as you did before.

12:26.113 --> 12:29.282
And then it becomes just like
the land you left behind.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.172
[clattering]

13:12.492 --> 13:13.927
[in Mi'kmaq]

13:34.514 --> 13:35.648
[grunts]

13:35.682 --> 13:37.250
[Ne'pa'tes exclaims]

13:38.018 --> 13:40.287
[choking]

13:42.455 --> 13:43.656
[breathing heavily]

13:43.690 --> 13:45.125
[Ne'pa'tes speaking Mi'kmaq]

13:49.296 --> 13:50.697
[woman 1 shouting in Mi'kmaq]

13:53.233 --> 13:54.367
[woman 2 shouting in Mi'kmaq]

13:59.239 --> 14:00.573
[woman 1 shouting in Mi'kmaq]

14:05.879 --> 14:07.080
[men shouting]

14:20.027 --> 14:22.429
[panting]

14:36.309 --> 14:39.046
[woman 1 speaking indistinctly]

14:46.153 --> 14:48.121
My son is dead.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.457
[speaks Mi'kmaq]

14:53.826 --> 14:55.795
[Peminuit]
He was my beloved brother.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.197
He did not deserve
such a death.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.545
It is the worst crime.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.349
We do not condone it.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.718
We cannot forgive it.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.789
It was done
without our knowledge,
believe me.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.195
We regret and abhor
the death of your son.

15:34.834 --> 15:38.171
This man belongs to you.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.345
Give this man to us,

15:45.378 --> 15:47.347
and we will make sure that
he is punished for his crime.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.468
[baby gurgling]

16:33.293 --> 16:34.494
[baby crying]

16:50.177 --> 16:51.644
Why does she stare at me?

16:53.313 --> 16:55.014
[Floki] You have blue eyes.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.820
To these people,
blue eyes mean danger.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.591
[exhales]

17:36.923 --> 17:38.391
[grunts]

17:38.425 --> 17:40.460
[distant shouting]

17:40.493 --> 17:41.594
[men yelling]

18:09.456 --> 18:11.924
Our Lord Jesus Christ
is with us.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.960
He is here on the battlefield,

18:13.993 --> 18:15.828
and I will not leave his side.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.569
Catapults!

18:22.602 --> 18:23.836
[men yelling]

18:29.776 --> 18:31.010
Loose!

18:31.043 --> 18:31.911
[Viking] Loose!

18:43.190 --> 18:46.926
[Ubbe] Naad, do you deny
the charge of murder?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.395
[Naad] Why do I need to?

18:48.428 --> 18:50.597
What is this?
Some kind of trial?

18:52.232 --> 18:53.266
Yes.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.307
[Naad] You can't
punish your own.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.142
Do you really believe
these Skraelings?

19:03.176 --> 19:04.911
They are liars.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.446
I was on my own.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.147
One of them attacked me.

19:08.181 --> 19:11.150
I killed him in self-defense,
and that's the truth!

19:11.184 --> 19:12.752
[Torvi] I believe the sagamaw.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.721
I believe she's telling
the truth about her son.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.056
Then you are a fool.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.293
All of you are fools
if you trust these savages.

19:24.231 --> 19:27.867
[Ubbe] Floki, what do you say?

19:27.900 --> 19:30.303
[Floki] These days,
I keep my own council.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.608
The world's more important
than we are.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.310
We should take care of it.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.746
That's all.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.692
[Othere] If we believe
Naad is guilty of the crime
he is accused of,

19:52.725 --> 19:55.228
then he must be punished.

19:56.529 --> 20:00.032
If murder can be overlooked,

20:00.066 --> 20:03.069
then there will
never be justice or trust

20:03.102 --> 20:04.737
in this new world.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.508
[Naad] I'll pay a fine.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.543
I will do whatever it takes
to make her feel better.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.445
Agreed?

20:14.414 --> 20:15.582
Agreed?

20:35.302 --> 20:38.137
[Ubbe] Othere tells me
that we are to
behave differently here.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.972
This is a new world.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.475
We are to behave
like different men and women,

20:42.509 --> 20:45.545
reborn in the image
of this new land.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.948
But I'm not so convinced.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.718
I think that our old laws
would serve us very well here.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.321
The gods are present.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.056
The gods are watching.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.465
This is an extreme punishment,

21:05.498 --> 21:06.866
but under the circumstances,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.435
I do think
that it is appropriate.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.904
So, Naad,

21:11.938 --> 21:15.708
thief, murderer, I sentence you
to be bloodeagled.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.778
[crying]

21:28.755 --> 21:30.390
[Ubbe] Are we agreed?

21:30.423 --> 21:32.058
-Agreed.
-[Viking] Agreed.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.893
-[woman] Agreed.
-Agreed.

21:36.162 --> 21:38.130
You don't understand.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.466
Ubbe has given you

21:39.499 --> 21:43.035
the opportunity
to go to Valhalla.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.637
But you must be very brave.

21:46.272 --> 21:50.443
However exquisite the pain,
don't show it.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.447
And then, so they say,

21:54.481 --> 21:56.516
Odin will open his door.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.852
You shall live eternally.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.675
Allfather! Where are you?

25:09.909 --> 25:10.877
Answer me!

-[bone snaps]

Lord, I'm afraid.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.608
Speak to me.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.677
Why don't you speak?

25:44.711 --> 25:47.279
Speak. Please. Please.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.148
I'm afraid.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.718
Speak!

25:51.751 --> 25:53.620
Why don't you speak to me?

It's the son of Ragnar!

Kill him!

26:27.620 --> 26:28.621

Get the son!

[somber music playing]

27:31.317 --> 27:33.452
Hvitserk. [chuckles]

27:33.485 --> 27:37.223
[Hvitserk] Your eyes have
turned deep blue, Ivar.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.225
You know what
that means. Remember?

27:39.258 --> 27:40.760
We used to watch over you.

27:42.461 --> 27:45.798
We knew that
when your eyes turned blue

27:45.832 --> 27:48.500
that you were in great danger
of breaking your bones.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.471
And we would say,
"Not today, Ivar.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.674
Not today."

28:02.048 --> 28:03.482
I remember.

28:17.897 --> 28:20.933
No! No! No! No. No, brother.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.035
You've done your work.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.905
Do not interfere anymore.

28:25.938 --> 28:29.041
All my life has been
a preparation for this moment.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.544
Stay back.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.787
I could never kill you.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.424
Your eyes are blue, Ivar.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.861
Not today.

Not today, Ivar. No.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.303
I love you.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.438
I love you, brother.
I love you.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.639
-I love you.
-I love you.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.175
Now, go.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.276
Go!

You are Ivar,

that fear you.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.529
[Alfred] By my command, cease!

32:43.562 --> 32:44.663
Not today.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.232
[Alfred] Our battle is ended.

I'm afraid. I'm afraid.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.151
I'm afraid.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.685
I won't tell anyone.

33:12.758 --> 33:16.828
No one will ever forget
Ivar the Boneless.

[gasps]

33:33.145 --> 33:34.346

36:16.308 --> 36:17.976
Valhalla's not for you,
my friend.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.680
Let me put you
out of your misery.

36:24.683 --> 36:25.517
Good.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.856
[choking]

36:40.932 --> 36:42.834
[bird cawing]

37:00.118 --> 37:01.687
You understand that

37:01.720 --> 37:05.524
when we said
you were welcome to this place,

37:05.557 --> 37:09.261
we did not mean
you were welcome to possess it.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.991
[Hvitserk] I wish
I had something important
to leave on your grave,

38:47.659 --> 38:50.396
but I sold my arm-ring
to the drug dealer.

[crying]

38:56.034 --> 38:57.002

38:58.336 --> 39:00.506
You don't know this,

39:00.539 --> 39:03.409
but you saved my life
so many times.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.381
And one day,
when we meet again,

39:09.415 --> 39:10.382
I can thank you.

39:14.853 --> 39:18.690
After all,
one way or the other,

39:18.724 --> 39:24.563
none of us really lived
a simple or ordinary life.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.598
And who wants
to live an ordinary life?

39:35.206 --> 39:39.845
So enjoy Valhalla, brother,
while it still exists.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.748
We can all see
the sky darkening.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.716
We can all see
the Twilight of the Gods.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.422
And I trust to be with you
in that great defeat.

39:52.424 --> 39:56.895
So, hail and farewell,
my brother.

40:02.468 --> 40:05.270
I'm just going to
sit here for a while.

40:05.303 --> 40:06.972
I'm sure you don't mind.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.953
[horn blows]

40:59.958 --> 41:01.793
You come from England?

41:01.827 --> 41:03.394
What news?

41:03.428 --> 41:05.931
Our army was defeated,
with great loss.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.366
[people murmuring]

41:08.399 --> 41:10.201
King Harald was
slain in the battle

41:11.770 --> 41:13.705
and also Ivar the Boneless.

41:13.739 --> 41:14.740
[people murmuring]

41:14.773 --> 41:16.007
Ivar?

41:21.146 --> 41:22.447
And Hvitserk?

41:41.967 --> 41:45.003
[Hvitserk] I renounce
the worship of Odin,

41:45.036 --> 41:47.338
Thor, Freyr and Freya

41:47.372 --> 41:49.307
and all other false gods.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.210
[Ingrid] We must
mourn our dead.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.479
So many.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.248
Death has undone so many.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.053
And Harald Finehair. And Ivar,

42:03.689 --> 42:05.156
son of Ragnar.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.294
The gods have been greedy

42:09.327 --> 42:11.162
to have the company
of such great men.

42:12.497 --> 42:13.765
[shouting]

42:14.833 --> 42:16.367
I renounce my former life.

42:21.139 --> 42:24.242
Father, I ask for baptism.

42:33.652 --> 42:37.222
[priest] I anoint you
with the oil of sanctification

42:38.724 --> 42:40.125
in the name of the Father,

42:40.959 --> 42:42.560
and of the Son,

42:45.931 --> 42:47.565
and of the Holy Spirit.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.339
Amen.

42:55.140 --> 42:56.174
Amen.

43:11.957 --> 43:14.693
[Alfred] Welcome to
our Holy Church.

43:14.726 --> 43:17.195
You entered here as a pagan,

43:17.228 --> 43:19.798
and you will leave here
as a Christian Saxon prince.

43:21.633 --> 43:24.703
As your godfather,
I've chosen a new name for you.

43:26.537 --> 43:29.240
From now on,
you will be known as Athelstan,

43:30.275 --> 43:31.609
our brother in Christ.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.248
[Nissa] The King
of Kattegat is dead.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.484
Long live the Queen!

43:39.517 --> 43:41.653
[all] Long live the Queen!

43:41.687 --> 43:43.855
Long live the Queen!

43:43.889 --> 43:46.024
Long live the Queen!

43:46.057 --> 43:48.159
Long live the Queen!

43:48.193 --> 43:50.195
-Long live the Queen!
-Long live the Queen.

43:50.228 --> 43:52.263
[all] Long live the Queen!

43:52.297 --> 43:54.399
Long live the Queen!

43:54.432 --> 43:56.034
Long live the Queen!

44:27.465 --> 44:28.834
[Ubbe] Do you have
any advice, Floki?

44:31.369 --> 44:32.370
[Floki] Advice?

44:34.806 --> 44:37.976
Always take stones
out of your shoe.

44:39.344 --> 44:40.746
That's good advice.

44:45.650 --> 44:47.518
Did we do the right thing
coming here?

44:49.755 --> 44:50.856
What do you think?

44:54.492 --> 44:56.061
I'm not sure we had a choice.

44:58.396 --> 45:00.198
I'm not sure about anything.

45:02.300 --> 45:03.601
Not anymore.

45:07.305 --> 45:08.473
[Ubbe] Are the gods here?

45:09.540 --> 45:11.342
Hmm?

45:11.376 --> 45:13.378
Have you seen them?

45:13.411 --> 45:15.046
Don't bother me with that.

45:17.482 --> 45:19.550
What business is that of mine?

45:22.287 --> 45:23.554
I am an ant,

45:25.290 --> 45:26.992
toiling on the forest floor.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.964
I see only
the leaf above my head.

45:35.600 --> 45:39.637
That leaf brings me some relief
from the sun.

45:46.511 --> 45:47.678
Are you happy?

45:48.980 --> 45:50.448
[scoffs]

45:54.285 --> 45:56.955
There's still so many things
that I need to know.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.790
You don't need
to know anything.

46:00.225 --> 46:01.927
It's not important.

46:03.728 --> 46:05.163
Let the past go.

46:15.706 --> 46:16.842
People love you.

46:19.845 --> 46:21.546
What does that mean exactly?

46:26.117 --> 46:27.518
Do you remember Ragnar?

46:29.420 --> 46:30.788
Of course I do.

46:34.092 --> 46:35.961
He disturbs my nights.

46:36.962 --> 46:39.030
He's always hanging around.

46:40.031 --> 46:41.532
I can't get rid of him.

46:45.603 --> 46:48.606
He keeps asking me
to build him a new boat.

46:49.407 --> 46:50.475
And I say,

46:50.508 --> 46:53.144
"What the hell do you
need a new boat for, Ragnar?

46:53.178 --> 46:54.412
You're dead!"

47:07.125 --> 47:08.426
You look like him.

47:18.970 --> 47:20.471
I don't care what you say,

47:23.341 --> 47:24.876
I love you, Floki.

47:29.147 --> 47:32.383
If you don't care what I say,
then I won't say anything.

47:35.753 --> 47:37.889
In any case, I'll be dead soon.

47:42.493 --> 47:43.929
Is that the end?

48:43.154 --> 48:45.456
