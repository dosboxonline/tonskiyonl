00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:01.989
Chinese new year is now
celebrated throughout the world,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.957
and we're about to witness

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.324
a spring festival carnival parade

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.618
at London's trafalgar square.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:11.458
There's so much festivities in the air!

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:15.033
He's finally slithered out of his cave.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.331
Bold move for a coward.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.163
Where have you been?

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.167
You're late!

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:32.455
Happy new year!

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.250
What are these?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Presents!

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:37.248
Showing up late with just these?

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.581
You've got some nerve!

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:39.697
There are more.

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:41.448
Wait, I can't manage.

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:43.157
Where's mine?

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:47.788
The one I just juggled.

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:49.948
If it's smashed, keep it.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.289
I'll put it in storage.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:53.292
Get in!

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:55.455
We're here!

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:56.868
Give me a hand.

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:57.875
- Here's lei!
- Uncle,

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.518
- I wish you the best of luck and health.
- Thank you so much!

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:01.156
Same to you.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.114
Happy new year!

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:03.456
So many presents!

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:04.534
Jiahua!

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.489
Give me a hug!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.500
Godfather!

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.535
This young man

00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:11.123
works with my son-in-law.

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:13.532
He's super capable

00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:14.914
and a decent man, too.

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:16.208
Moreover,

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.493
he is unattached!

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:18.538
A smooch...

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:19.782
Give godfather a kiss!

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
A call from my daughter!

00:02:56.417 --> 00:02:57.281
Hi, dad!

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:59.248
Happy new year!

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.661
Happy new year to you, too.

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:03.907
How's your sore throat?

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:05.322
I'm good.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:06.118
I heeded your advice,

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:07.331
and quit smoking.

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:10.247
Where are you?

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.660
I'm in Africa!

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:12.702
Let me show you...

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:14.039
Africa?

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:15.583
Can you see?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.365
You have to stay alert.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.080
Is your boyfriend with you?

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:20.323
I don't have one.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.118
Fareeda,

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:22.285
meiwei is here, have a chat with her.

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.283
- Fareeda, happy new year!
- Dad.

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:25.618
- Dad, I'm losing you...
- Meiwei here...

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:26.284
Hello?

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:27.948
I don't have a signal.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:28.742
Fareeda...

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.750
Hello?

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.039
Juma, let's go!

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:38.038
Okay.

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:39.323
Poor connection.

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:41.073
Yes, as always,

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.449
whenever I want to start a conversation.

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.456
She's avoiding me.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:46.697
No way!

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:47.788
Don't over-react.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:03.447
Get out!

00:04:03.458 --> 00:04:04.823
Come on, now!

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:08.333
Move!

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.750
Sir,

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.123
the qin couple has been kidnapped.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.035
Did you call the police?

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:28.122
Just called them.

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:30.081
There's a Chinese new year parade.

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:31.948
There are thousands of revellers,

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.664
all roads are blocked.

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:34.952
The police will take time to respond.

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.073
Where is qin?

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:37.458
On the move

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.830
but still in Chinatown.

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:40.198
Are therevanguards in the area?

00:04:40.542 --> 00:04:42.157
Two off-dutyvanguards nearby.

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:44.365
Send them to rescue qin guoli right away.

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.375
Yes, sir!

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:52.667
One.

00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:54.542
Two.

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:56.375
Three.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.706
Amazing!

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:01.244
See what godfather has brought you?

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.536
Godfather, who is that?

00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:04.823
Captain China!

00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:06.162
He looks just like your dad.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.328
Captain China is my dad!

00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:09.117
Yes.

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:10.245
Dear boy, give daddy a kiss.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.706
Our vip clients are kidnapped.

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:20.157
Emergency deployment requested.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.535
About 400m from your current location.

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:22.542
Stay alert!

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:23.667
Copy that!

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.455
Mom, we need to go.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.034
Let's go.

00:05:25.042 --> 00:05:25.827
What's the hurry?

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:26.833
It's work.

00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.244
Jiahua, keep your aunt amused.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:35.833
There!

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:44.625
Sit down!

00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:49.369
Good afternoon, mr qin.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.115
Who are you people?

00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:59.864
You betrayed Omar's father's location
to the Americans, didn't you?

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:02.742
No, I didn't know where his father was.

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:07.205
Omar's...

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:08.448
Still alive?

00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:12.372
The money!

00:06:13.083 --> 00:06:14.869
Omar's father's money,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.615
do you have it?

00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:19.667
No,

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:20.875
I don't know.

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.323
Is he your husband?

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.456
Yes...

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:31.990
Please, don't hurt my wife.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.864
Honey - no, please

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:34.081
let me explain.

00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:35.364
She has nothing to do with this!

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:36.375
Honey...

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:39.199
Do you know what it's
like to lose your loved ones?

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:40.708
Mr qin!

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:50.163
The money!

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:52.083
Tell me!

00:06:58.542 --> 00:06:59.542
We're in position.

00:07:02.042 --> 00:07:03.077
Brought your gun?

00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:04.664
No, it's my day off.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:06.410
What about you?

00:07:06.417 --> 00:07:07.417
Of course!

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.706
It's with them.

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:10.292
Cover me.

00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:20.823
Sir, we are closed.

00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:21.663
Closed?

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:22.667
Yes.

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.031
I'm the boss!

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:24.701
Hey! Stop!

00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:25.413
I'm his brother.

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:26.417
I don't care.

00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:34.781
He's unarmed.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Let's split up.

00:07:41.917 --> 00:07:42.917
Kill her!

00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:44.542
No, no!

00:07:45.042 --> 00:07:46.042
Please...

00:07:50.042 --> 00:07:51.748
I know where the money is.

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:53.292
Good.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:00.448
Hand over the money to me

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.164
and I won't hurt you

00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:03.657
or your wife.

00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:17.447
Hi.

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:18.618
We're closed today.

00:08:18.625 --> 00:08:19.990
Your puppy needs you.

00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:38.042
Run!

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.208
Come with me!

00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.083
Get her!

00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:57.708
Run!

00:09:14.792 --> 00:09:15.792
Go inside.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:18.197
C'mon.

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:19.542
Go.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.500
Take cover.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.250
Kaixuan, where are you?

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:22.538
I'm frying a pig's knuckle!

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.490
He's just security.

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:39.409
Hand over qin guoli to me
and I will let you leave.

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:40.998
It's just a job,

00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:43.494
why risk your life over it?

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:47.408
They don't pay enough
for you to work this hard.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Who are you?

00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:54.333
Jump!

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I'm fromvanguard!

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.535
Don't shoot.

00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:16.910
We need him alive.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.500
Go!

00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:19.792
Let's go.

00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:21.702
Miya, where are you?

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.202
I'm 30 seconds away.

00:12:27.083 --> 00:12:27.697
Come...

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:28.833
This way!

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:32.333
Hurry...

00:12:33.458 --> 00:12:34.458
C'mon.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.250
Get in,

00:12:36.917 --> 00:12:37.917
quick!

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:46.542
Don't shoot!

00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:47.743
He's hurt.

00:12:48.083 --> 00:12:49.083
You alright?

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:50.125
I'm okay.

00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:01.498
The gang that captured qin

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.786
are from the arctic wolves.

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:06.119
Their leader is broto.

00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:08.282
They'll do anything for money.

00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:17.657
Why are they after you?

00:14:20.083 --> 00:14:23.075
I had a business partner called maasym.

00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:25.078
I made him a fortune

00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:25.697
by selling oil

00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:27.198
and artefacts in Europe.

00:14:27.708 --> 00:14:28.788
I only found out later

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.789
he ran the gang brotherhood of vengeance.

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:33.699
I tried to quit but it was too late.

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:35.532
Maasym forced me

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.123
to arrange funds for him

00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:38.831
to buy weapons of mass destruction,

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:40.368
or he would kill me

00:14:40.917 --> 00:14:42.282
and my family.

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:46.125
Later,

00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:48.164
I tipped off the London police

00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:49.873
about him.

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:53.805
Maasym was killed in a military operation.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.116
His eldest son Omar survived.

00:14:56.625 --> 00:14:59.037
So Omar sent the arctic wolves?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Yes.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.036
If they can't get me,

00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:07.532
they'll go after my daughter.

00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:09.078
Can you send someone

00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:10.083
to bring her back?

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.239
Where's she now?

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.410
Africa.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.240
I'll see to it.

00:15:15.542 --> 00:15:16.542
Thank you.

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:29.823
Boss, broto.

00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:33.789
Taken away by who?

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:35.539
They call themselves vanguard.

00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.243
What'svanguard?

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.037
Vanguard is an international
private security company

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:43.703
most of them are retired military

00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:45.578
or security experts.

00:15:45.667 --> 00:15:48.704
Their services include
security for shipping, and vip protection.

00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:49.708
Enough!

00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:52.118
Qin has a daughter.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.490
Bring her to me

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.412
and he will scurry out of whatever hole

00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:58.073
he's crawled into, okay?

00:15:58.083 --> 00:15:59.198
Yes, sir!

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:05.492
Sir,

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.910
the intel from qin

00:16:06.917 --> 00:16:08.623
has been verified by the London police.

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:09.625
Good.

00:16:17.792 --> 00:16:20.158
The girl went alone to
protect African wildlife

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:23.249
and risked her life recording poachers.

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:24.452
She's brave.

00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:27.165
Among wildlife conservationists,

00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:28.202
she's an activist.

00:16:28.458 --> 00:16:29.573
In Africa,

00:16:29.583 --> 00:16:30.993
30,000 elephants

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.833
are slaughtered by hunters every year.

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.573
I have great respect for her.

00:16:35.583 --> 00:16:36.572
Just look at her video,

00:16:36.583 --> 00:16:37.823
uploaded an hour ago,

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.449
now we have more adversaries.

00:16:42.708 --> 00:16:43.708
We must find her quickly.

00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:45.786
We have reason to believe that

00:16:45.792 --> 00:16:48.864
the volunteers were
victims of a group of poachers

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.706
led by a man named tunda.

00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:53.494
Murderous scum like him
should be locked up!

00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:56.331
I want her dead!

00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:15.663
Tunda!

00:17:16.208 --> 00:17:17.789
How's it going, my friend?

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:19.282
Good to see you.

00:17:19.292 --> 00:17:21.032
Look at you, superstar!

00:17:21.042 --> 00:17:23.408
400,000 clicks in one hour.

00:17:23.708 --> 00:17:24.538
Not bad, my brother.

00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:25.782
Shut up!

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:28.157
This girl,

00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:29.282
I'm gonna find her

00:17:29.292 --> 00:17:30.532
and kill her.

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:31.406
We're looking for her, too.

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.499
Come on, let me introduce you to my boss.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.990
Hey, boss, this is tunda,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.740
the best hunter in all of Africa.

00:17:37.542 --> 00:17:39.157
Can you find the girl?

00:17:44.208 --> 00:17:47.245
She said the kill count was 1197?

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.289
Once I get to her,

00:17:49.292 --> 00:17:51.533
I'm going to make it an even 120!

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:54.249
You hunt animals, I hunt people.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.490
The only difference is,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.582
I got my trophy taken alive.

00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:02.282
Here's your deposit for now.

00:18:02.292 --> 00:18:05.159
You'll get the big bucks
once you complete the hunt.

00:18:07.292 --> 00:18:08.498
Let's go hunting!

00:18:08.542 --> 00:18:11.124
Yeah! Go hunting! Let's go!

00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:13.248
Yeah! Yeah! Go hunting!

00:18:23.542 --> 00:18:25.032
Charlie, come. Charlie, come on!

00:18:57.417 --> 00:18:58.497
There she is.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.490
Juma, who are they?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.500
I don't know.

00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:08.206
Are you fareeda?

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:09.333
Yes.

00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:10.160
There are lions here.

00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:11.202
Back off.

00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:14.243
Charlie, stay.

00:19:16.583 --> 00:19:17.583
Gosh,

00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:20.372
they're real lions!

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.410
Stay! Stay!

00:19:22.417 --> 00:19:23.532
Lei, stay calm!

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.456
Stand your ground!

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.036
Your father sent us

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:29.122
to come and fetch you.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.115
They're here to kidnap you!

00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:35.160
Come over now!

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.250
Lei, go get her!

00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:39.827
Charlie, back.

00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:40.743
Sir,

00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:41.958
lions on the loose!

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.286
What are you afraid of?

00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:45.498
It's a male.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.740
There's also a lioness.

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:49.375
Stay!

00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:51.458
She's over there.

00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:55.867
Get the guns!

00:19:55.875 --> 00:19:56.875
Yes, sir.

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:01.375
Follow me.

00:20:02.583 --> 00:20:03.583
There!

00:20:03.667 --> 00:20:05.373
Kill them all except fareeda.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.375
Damn you!

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:13.452
Vanguard again!

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:24.750
Stay with me.

00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:28.077
Get the girl, now!

00:20:35.792 --> 00:20:37.592
This girl, she's gonna
get what she deserves.

00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:39.244
What are you doing? We need her alive.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:39.989
What?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.160
I'll cover you. Go get her!

00:20:41.167 --> 00:20:42.202
Whatever...

00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:02.167
Get in!

00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:41.958
Get out! Come on!

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.500
Charlie!

00:21:44.542 --> 00:21:45.542
Help me!

00:21:47.417 --> 00:21:48.657
Charlie... Charlie!

00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:49.576
Come here!

00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:50.907
Charlie! Help me!

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.865
Charlie, over here!

00:21:56.875 --> 00:21:57.910
Who's Charlie?

00:21:58.667 --> 00:21:59.827
Tell him to hurry.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.500
Leave with her now.

00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:11.125
Get in.

00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:18.583
C'm on!

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.035
Tunda, come help!

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:23.375
Hurry!

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.865
Help me!

00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:27.125
Charlie!

00:22:30.375 --> 00:22:31.375
Charlie!

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:32.917
Charlie, don't...

00:22:33.917 --> 00:22:35.202
Charlie, go away!

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Charlie!

00:22:37.167 --> 00:22:38.077
Let go!

00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:39.125
He's ignoring me.

00:22:39.167 --> 00:22:40.202
Don't move!

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:42.167
Hold still!

00:22:42.208 --> 00:22:44.244
Why is no one listening?

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.250
Don't run!

00:22:48.792 --> 00:22:49.907
Lie down and play dead!

00:22:50.333 --> 00:22:50.867
I am dead

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
what?

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:14.785
Come on, let's go.

00:23:15.208 --> 00:23:15.742
Get in!

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:16.580
Go go! Come on!

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.750
Go, go, go!

00:23:17.958 --> 00:23:18.993
Quick!

00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:27.457
Keep going! Don't let my trophy get away!

00:23:44.792 --> 00:23:45.792
No, no.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:49.581
You let her get away!

00:23:49.792 --> 00:23:51.703
The best hunter in Africa? My ass!

00:23:51.708 --> 00:23:53.289
You can't even hunt down a woman.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.911
I'm the best because I have Patience.

00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:58.374
Even hyenas understand
the cost of Patience.

00:23:58.542 --> 00:23:59.998
They wait hours, even days,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.115
before they get their prey.

00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:03.332
I didn't pay for you to
preach about hyenas.

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.078
She just got lucky.

00:24:06.792 --> 00:24:08.032
Bring her to me,

00:24:08.042 --> 00:24:10.078
or you'll become my prey.

00:24:10.667 --> 00:24:11.667
Now,

00:24:12.292 --> 00:24:13.577
what's up ahead?

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.956
It's just a jungle.

00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:17.667
Follow me.

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:21.240
What do you use the gun for?

00:24:21.792 --> 00:24:22.827
Elephants.

00:24:53.417 --> 00:24:55.157
Juma, are you okay?

00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:56.447
What about you?

00:24:56.458 --> 00:24:57.538
I'll manage...

00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:00.417
Yuanxu,

00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:01.657
what's the status?

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.289
We've located lei

00:25:03.375 --> 00:25:05.331
20km away in the jungle,

00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:06.743
moving towards the southwest.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.160
Vehicles can't pass through
a primeval forest.

00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:09.373
Go on foot,

00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:10.375
and be careful!

00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:14.161
Miya, take them to the hospital.

00:25:14.167 --> 00:25:15.373
Ok - be careful

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:18.583
sir!

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:21.656
You should be taking them to hospital.

00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:22.531
What are you doing here?

00:25:22.542 --> 00:25:23.907
Jonathan can drive.

00:25:23.958 --> 00:25:25.164
I'll go with you.

00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:26.792
Come on, then.

00:26:04.792 --> 00:26:05.907
Calling London hq,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
please come in.

00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:08.163
Roger that.

00:26:08.208 --> 00:26:09.664
We've located lei.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.910
The coordinates show

00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:12.873
he and fareeda are in an avian observatory.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.536
His vital signs are normal.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.489
Copy that.

00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:16.708
Keep moving.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.480
We need to get there before daybreak.

00:28:05.042 --> 00:28:06.042
Awake?

00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:15.990
What kind of bird is that?

00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:17.583
Take a look.

00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:18.875
Okay.

00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:22.831
Bird of paradise!

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.160
These birds

00:28:24.167 --> 00:28:26.287
spend their lives searching
for happiness and freedom.

00:28:26.458 --> 00:28:27.948
When they meet their own kind,

00:28:28.125 --> 00:28:29.331
they dance for each other.

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:32.290
Tribal people used their feathers

00:28:32.292 --> 00:28:33.748
to decorate themselves.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.957
They're prized in Europe
in the 19th century.

00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:37.208
But because of

00:28:37.417 --> 00:28:38.748
excessive hunting,

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:41.324
they're so rare now.

00:28:46.042 --> 00:28:47.327
You hang out with lions,

00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:48.789
and exotic birds.

00:28:49.083 --> 00:28:50.118
You're a carefree spirit,

00:28:50.125 --> 00:28:51.114
a romantic at heart,

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:52.365
in pursuit of your dreams.

00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:53.667
You must be a Virgo.

00:28:53.833 --> 00:28:55.414
I think you're a Virgo.

00:28:56.667 --> 00:28:57.702
How could you tell?

00:28:58.833 --> 00:29:00.414
Are you really?

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.785
Faster, faster!

00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:06.998
Right behind the big tree!

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.240
Let's go! Let's go!

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.614
Let's get out of here.

00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:13.667
Sure.

00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:17.620
Go straight. They're 100m ahead.

00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:19.240
Don't let them get away!

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.536
Two unidentified vehicles

00:29:22.542 --> 00:29:23.497
are heading for lei.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.956
They're three minutes away.

00:29:25.042 --> 00:29:25.747
Ok.

00:29:25.917 --> 00:29:26.917
Got it.

00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:32.740
Go, attack!

00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.118
Got 'em all, sir.

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:15.125
Let's go.

00:30:16.542 --> 00:30:17.542
Once more.

00:30:19.625 --> 00:30:21.161
Hop in, sir!

00:30:23.833 --> 00:30:24.948
Move over,

00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:26.125
let me...

00:30:32.583 --> 00:30:33.583
They're coming!

00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:34.697
- Hurry!
- Move!

00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:35.708
Ok.

00:30:45.625 --> 00:30:46.625
Hurry!

00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:50.827
Hurry up, hurry!

00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:55.333
Hold on tight!

00:31:20.292 --> 00:31:21.292
Broto!

00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.244
Jet ski, surround them now.

00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:25.373
She did get lucky last time.

00:31:25.417 --> 00:31:26.998
This won't happen again.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.286
No bullets, I want her taken alive.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.500
Go!

00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:31.875
Go, get them!

00:31:37.792 --> 00:31:38.872
Go, go, go!

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.250
Faster!

00:32:03.833 --> 00:32:04.833
Closer!

00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:06.667
Go!

00:32:11.583 --> 00:32:13.369
Virgo, help me!

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.500
Chopstick!

00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:39.663
Fareeda - get closer!

00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:54.664
Go! Go!

00:33:16.542 --> 00:33:17.542
Fareeda!

00:33:49.542 --> 00:33:50.542
Virgo...

00:34:00.292 --> 00:34:00.872
Help!

00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:02.535
Hang in there, Miya!

00:34:11.708 --> 00:34:12.708
Go!

00:34:17.917 --> 00:34:18.917
Get away!

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.581
Get away! Get off me!

00:34:25.292 --> 00:34:26.292
No!

00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:34.708
Help me, sir!

00:34:35.458 --> 00:34:36.458
Help!

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:49.250
Miya!

00:35:04.333 --> 00:35:05.664
We're done for.

00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:07.625
Brace yourself,

00:35:07.833 --> 00:35:08.833
jump!

00:35:56.667 --> 00:35:58.248
Here!

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.410
Over here!

00:35:59.875 --> 00:36:02.207
What are you yelling for?
They can't hear you!

00:36:02.542 --> 00:36:05.579
Over here! We're here!

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.115
Qin guoli has assets

00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:13.582
belonging to the brotherhood of vengeance.

00:36:13.583 --> 00:36:15.824
You say vanguard leaves no man behind.

00:36:15.833 --> 00:36:17.289
So listen to me carefully.

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:19.073
Deliver qin guoli to us

00:36:19.083 --> 00:36:20.243
and I'll let your man go.

00:36:20.875 --> 00:36:22.581
If you fail to make this exchange,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.206
they'll be beheaded.

00:36:26.708 --> 00:36:28.244
I volunteer myself

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.911
for the release of my daughter

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:31.615
and your colleague.

00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:32.785
No, you mustn't.

00:36:32.792 --> 00:36:33.827
It's dangerous.

00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:37.453
There must be another way.

00:36:37.583 --> 00:36:38.583
I'll be fine,

00:36:38.667 --> 00:36:39.667
trust me.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.206
May I have a word in private?

00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:45.208
Of course.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.660
Give us a minute.

00:36:49.292 --> 00:36:50.292
I'll be fine.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.081
What are you hiding?

00:37:03.625 --> 00:37:04.990
I'm the only one who knows

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.865
where maasym's assets are.

00:37:07.417 --> 00:37:09.157
I must settle the score with Omar.

00:37:09.542 --> 00:37:10.542
Mr tang,

00:37:10.917 --> 00:37:12.032
if they use this money

00:37:12.042 --> 00:37:13.407
to buy more weapons,

00:37:13.792 --> 00:37:15.828
many lives will be at stake.

00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:18.369
Protecting the innocents

00:37:18.375 --> 00:37:20.661
is our Paramount duty.

00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:23.375
Thank you.

00:37:24.958 --> 00:37:25.958
Greed...

00:37:26.208 --> 00:37:27.823
Is the root of all evils.

00:37:35.583 --> 00:37:38.370
One, two, three, four...

00:37:38.667 --> 00:37:41.158
- Hi, jiahua.
- Five, six, seven,

00:37:41.167 --> 00:37:42.828
eight, nine.

00:37:43.292 --> 00:37:44.782
Dad, this is for you.

00:37:45.292 --> 00:37:46.292
My dear boy!

00:37:49.792 --> 00:37:50.406
What brings you here?

00:37:50.708 --> 00:37:52.369
He wants to give you a present.

00:37:53.292 --> 00:37:55.658
Present? What for?

00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:57.453
Because I wanted to.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.661
It's your birthday today!

00:38:00.125 --> 00:38:02.366
Daddy is so absent-minded!

00:38:02.708 --> 00:38:03.993
We're still waiting for the support...

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.410
Hold on just one sec...

00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:06.577
Okay.

00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:07.583
Let's go.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.659
Who's that?

00:38:11.667 --> 00:38:12.782
That's daddy.

00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:16.405
- Daddy?
- To him, you are captain China.

00:38:17.208 --> 00:38:18.869
- Really?
- What did we discuss?

00:38:19.167 --> 00:38:20.657
What about captain China?

00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:23.574
He's mightier than captain America!

00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:26.244
He's awesome!

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.500
Give me five!

00:38:30.458 --> 00:38:32.244
But he's much stronger than me.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.581
Daddy's the strongest!

00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:35.281
Now give daddy a kiss.

00:38:35.292 --> 00:38:37.704
Happy birthday to you,

00:38:38.042 --> 00:38:41.205
happy birthday to you!

00:38:41.375 --> 00:38:44.822
Happy birthday to kaixuan,

00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:47.791
happy birthday to you.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.206
Thank you, sir. Thanks everyone.

00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:52.333
I'll make a wish,

00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:56.578
for lei's safe return.

00:38:59.417 --> 00:39:01.248
Daddy's awesome!

00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:03.289
Please share the cake.

00:39:03.583 --> 00:39:04.583
Okay.

00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:07.448
Here, a baby panda for you!

00:39:07.708 --> 00:39:08.708
Take it.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.331
Take it. And say: Thank you, sir.

00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:11.948
Thank you, sir.

00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:13.448
Just call me bro!

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.580
Bro!

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:15.364
Right.

00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:16.490
Call her auntie.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.364
Say auntie.

00:39:17.375 --> 00:39:18.455
Who are you calling auntie?

00:39:19.875 --> 00:39:21.115
Sis would do.

00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:22.288
Sis!

00:39:22.292 --> 00:39:22.826
Good boy.

00:39:22.833 --> 00:39:25.199
Okay, let's go out with sis,

00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:26.197
and let daddy get back to work

00:39:26.208 --> 00:39:27.539
go play with auntie.

00:39:27.542 --> 00:39:28.998
Stop misleading children!

00:39:32.125 --> 00:39:33.956
Lei has been withvanguard

00:39:33.958 --> 00:39:34.993
for five years?

00:39:35.208 --> 00:39:36.914
Five years, three months and 28 days, sir.

00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:42.999
This operation is challenging.

00:39:43.708 --> 00:39:45.369
Since you're still recuperating,

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:48.282
why don't you stay behind as back-up?

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.990
Sir, don't worry, I'm fine.

00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:55.243
Your boy drew this?

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Yes.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:00.910
Quite frankly,

00:40:00.917 --> 00:40:02.578
I'm not sure how this would turn out.

00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:06.244
Jiahua has already lost his mom.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.860
You should stay to look after him.

00:40:18.292 --> 00:40:19.532
You are now our ceo,

00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:20.577
you don't have to go.

00:40:20.875 --> 00:40:22.831
I've a duty to bring my team back.

00:40:23.917 --> 00:40:24.917
Fine,

00:40:25.292 --> 00:40:26.532
then let's go together.

00:40:28.542 --> 00:40:29.542
Linda,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.911
I think we should

00:40:32.917 --> 00:40:34.248
order some of these.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:35.250
Gorgeous.

00:40:37.208 --> 00:40:37.913
Gorgeous!

00:40:37.917 --> 00:40:38.917
Really?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.739
For you.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:19.750
Thank you.

00:41:20.042 --> 00:41:23.079
Jiadebala population is 50,000 citizens.

00:41:23.083 --> 00:41:25.495
2,000 of them are Omar's fighters.

00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:28.082
They use the area as a training ground.

00:41:28.083 --> 00:41:29.823
Due to the rugged terrain,

00:41:29.833 --> 00:41:31.494
the government couldn't take it back.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.661
We need more intel before we go in.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.865
Do we have anyone on the ground?

00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:37.536
Yes, we have a source.

00:41:37.542 --> 00:41:38.542
He's on it.

00:41:39.083 --> 00:41:40.083
Good.

00:41:41.917 --> 00:41:44.158
We are entering uncharted territories,

00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:46.119
we'll be up against extreme dangers.

00:41:47.083 --> 00:41:49.495
You are the best of the best,

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.990
virtuous and trustworthy,

00:41:51.458 --> 00:41:52.493
loyal and reliable.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.206
For our obligations,

00:41:54.792 --> 00:41:55.907
for our comrades-in-arms,

00:41:56.458 --> 00:41:58.449
we must overcome all odds!

00:41:59.167 --> 00:42:00.077
We have to return

00:42:00.125 --> 00:42:01.285
triumphantly!

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.328
In triumph!

00:42:04.792 --> 00:42:06.328
We will return victorious!

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.035
Victorious!

00:42:08.458 --> 00:42:09.538
Victorious!

00:42:10.292 --> 00:42:10.872
Let's go!

00:42:11.167 --> 00:42:11.781
Move!

00:42:12.167 --> 00:42:13.167
Move!

00:42:39.458 --> 00:42:43.497
Jiadebala dates back a thousand years.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.036
It's home to many priceless relics.

00:42:45.042 --> 00:42:47.033
When the brotherhood captured the city,

00:42:47.042 --> 00:42:50.114
they sold off artefacts, smuggled drugs

00:42:50.125 --> 00:42:51.410
and made a fortune.

00:42:52.375 --> 00:42:55.572
The locals have become their hostages.

00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:57.915
If government forces were to attack,

00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:02.038
the city can be destroyed overnight.

00:43:02.042 --> 00:43:04.875
Can we trust kalasu's friend?

00:43:05.042 --> 00:43:06.202
Will he help us?

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:08.408
Abati is the best chef around.

00:43:08.417 --> 00:43:09.497
His only son was shot dead

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.082
by drug gangs.

00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:18.870
This is the hostage fareeda.

00:43:18.875 --> 00:43:21.457
Lei is one of ours.

00:43:21.458 --> 00:43:23.289
We cannot leave them behind.

00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:25.907
You know what it's like

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:28.790
to wanna save someone you care about.

00:43:33.792 --> 00:43:35.282
I can help you and your family

00:43:35.583 --> 00:43:37.323
start a new life somewhere else.

00:43:37.792 --> 00:43:40.955
I just need your help
to get us inside the fortress.

00:43:51.083 --> 00:43:53.244
I can only transport her.

00:43:53.417 --> 00:43:56.375
Rest of the team
have to take the unguarded route.

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:58.157
Why are there no guards?

00:43:58.167 --> 00:43:59.167
It's rough.

00:43:59.833 --> 00:44:01.744
How are you gonna escape?

00:44:02.417 --> 00:44:03.623
We've a plan,

00:44:03.958 --> 00:44:05.664
but we need your help.

00:44:14.708 --> 00:44:16.039
Open up, Mohammed.

00:44:16.042 --> 00:44:17.452
This is abati.

00:44:24.625 --> 00:44:27.412
This is the closest
I can get you to the fortress.

00:44:27.625 --> 00:44:29.115
I have to go now.

00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:30.406
Mohammed is my man.

00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:31.577
He'll take care of you.

00:44:31.583 --> 00:44:32.583
Okay.

00:44:33.167 --> 00:44:34.167
Come.

00:44:51.417 --> 00:44:52.327
This special war paint

00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:53.493
will save me from getting killed

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.500
by friendly fire.

00:45:22.083 --> 00:45:23.914
These two bulletproof vehicles

00:45:23.917 --> 00:45:26.157
are specially modified for Omar,
just like armoured cars.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.911
Will they really kill us?

00:45:42.333 --> 00:45:44.540
I don't want to die so young.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.082
Show me your right palm.

00:45:57.875 --> 00:45:58.875
Don't worry,

00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:00.083
you'll survive.

00:46:00.375 --> 00:46:01.375
Why?

00:46:01.583 --> 00:46:03.369
You have a long life line.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.250
What's this?

00:46:21.083 --> 00:46:23.495
Don't worry, vanguard will come for us.

00:46:25.208 --> 00:46:26.208
But how?

00:46:32.083 --> 00:46:33.698
I have good news for you.

00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:35.703
Your father is on his way,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.581
and your boss, too.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.500
Get him out.

00:46:41.625 --> 00:46:42.625
What do you want?

00:46:43.708 --> 00:46:44.914
Where are you taking him?

00:46:46.042 --> 00:46:47.873
Where are you taking him?

00:47:09.125 --> 00:47:11.912
We're destined to cross paths again.

00:47:11.917 --> 00:47:14.499
First you snatched someone from our grasp.

00:47:14.958 --> 00:47:16.949
This time I have you captured.

00:47:17.833 --> 00:47:20.165
Not many can get even with us.

00:47:22.375 --> 00:47:23.990
My boss sees something special in you.

00:47:24.458 --> 00:47:25.994
Work with us,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.707
you'll earn more in a year

00:47:28.708 --> 00:47:29.708
than a lifetime.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.581
We are different.

00:47:31.958 --> 00:47:33.323
We both risk lives for money.

00:47:33.333 --> 00:47:34.368
What's so different?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.615
Be content, know your weaknesses.

00:47:39.042 --> 00:47:40.077
Things you do,

00:47:40.583 --> 00:47:41.618
things you don't.

00:47:44.167 --> 00:47:45.498
What are you talking about?

00:47:45.833 --> 00:47:46.868
I don't understand.

00:47:47.625 --> 00:47:49.832
Never indulge in desire.

00:47:50.875 --> 00:47:52.831
Know yourself.

00:47:54.083 --> 00:47:57.246
Know what you should do,

00:47:58.083 --> 00:48:00.415
know what you shouldn't do.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.082
You've learned our tongue,

00:48:06.292 --> 00:48:08.123
but not our ethics.

00:48:10.333 --> 00:48:11.743
Boss, he says that...

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.080
Big mistake.

00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:19.208
Take him away.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.116
They're strapping a bomb vest on lei,

00:48:31.458 --> 00:48:33.039
with a timer.

00:48:47.417 --> 00:48:50.864
Vanguard has promised to bring qin
in exchange for the hostages.

00:48:51.625 --> 00:48:53.115
But I wouldn't trust them.

00:48:53.542 --> 00:48:55.373
They will attempt a rescue.

00:48:57.167 --> 00:49:00.455
In the millennia since
our fortress was built,

00:49:00.458 --> 00:49:02.164
there's never been a breach.

00:49:02.375 --> 00:49:05.367
Our warriors have been
trained since boyhood.

00:49:05.708 --> 00:49:07.414
We should still take precaution.

00:49:07.417 --> 00:49:08.657
Step up security

00:49:09.125 --> 00:49:10.706
and shoot on sight.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Boss.

00:49:18.708 --> 00:49:19.948
What's the plan?

00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:22.240
The deal is still on.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.160
Did you prepare the money?

00:49:24.375 --> 00:49:25.375
Yes.

00:49:25.667 --> 00:49:27.498
Time and location of exchange?

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.081
I will let you know.

00:49:33.208 --> 00:49:34.808
- Good evening, brothers.
- Good evening.

00:49:34.875 --> 00:49:36.786
- Come try some snacks.
- Thank you.

00:49:36.792 --> 00:49:37.872
Got to go.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.410
Go!

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.535
Holy shit!

00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:04.699
Even wearing my mask,
this place reeks like hell!

00:50:04.708 --> 00:50:06.073
I can't stand it anymore.

00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:07.083
Keep moving!

00:50:07.417 --> 00:50:10.124
The masks are no match for the smells.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.500
Too stinky.

00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:29.032
At twelve o'clock,

00:50:29.042 --> 00:50:30.327
four gunmen

00:50:30.333 --> 00:50:31.573
are heading north.

00:50:31.833 --> 00:50:32.993
At three o'clock,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.116
one armed man is standing guard.

00:50:35.125 --> 00:50:37.207
All clear on the south side.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.956
You do your usual beat.

00:50:56.542 --> 00:50:57.577
We're in.

00:51:02.583 --> 00:51:04.699
Everything's normal.

00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:06.285
Split up as planned.

00:51:06.292 --> 00:51:07.292
Copy that.

00:51:08.958 --> 00:51:10.869
Laila, she stays with you tonight.

00:51:11.042 --> 00:51:12.042
Okay.

00:51:14.792 --> 00:51:17.204
I'll bring you to Omar's compound tomorrow.

00:51:17.208 --> 00:51:18.414
Please turn off the light.

00:51:18.417 --> 00:51:19.417
Yes.

00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:02.163
Explosive all set

00:52:02.208 --> 00:52:03.208
go!

00:53:22.917 --> 00:53:24.623
We've located lei on the rooftop.

00:53:28.583 --> 00:53:29.868
There are two snipers

00:53:29.875 --> 00:53:31.456
lurking at twelve o'clock.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
They are here.

00:53:59.792 --> 00:54:01.999
Let's shoot some Chinese ducks.

00:54:09.542 --> 00:54:10.657
I'm in position.

00:54:15.583 --> 00:54:16.789
You'd better leave now.

00:54:16.792 --> 00:54:17.792
Okay.

00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:28.823
Dad, dad...

00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:29.875
Don't move!

00:54:31.125 --> 00:54:32.160
Dad...

00:54:36.292 --> 00:54:37.998
I'm the head of vanguard.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.456
Let's make the exchange.

00:54:39.458 --> 00:54:43.406
You speak with the conviction
and impatience of a man in charge,

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.582
but you're not in charge here!

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.573
Mr qin, have you brought
me what I asked for?

00:54:59.458 --> 00:55:00.789
Come on, give it to me.

00:55:07.583 --> 00:55:09.198
Target is in the trap,

00:55:09.542 --> 00:55:11.203
we'll finish them.

00:55:16.542 --> 00:55:18.032
What is this bullshit?

00:55:18.417 --> 00:55:21.909
That's the list of
your father's assets I managed.

00:55:22.083 --> 00:55:24.244
He converted most of them into gold

00:55:24.542 --> 00:55:27.739
but hid it away in a secure place.

00:55:28.208 --> 00:55:29.573
I can take you there.

00:55:31.792 --> 00:55:32.827
Honour your promise,

00:55:32.833 --> 00:55:34.414
release fareeda and lei.

00:55:37.583 --> 00:55:39.665
Not until I have the assets.

00:55:49.375 --> 00:55:51.991
I heardvanguard never leaves anyone behind.

00:55:53.208 --> 00:55:55.164
I'd like to test that theory.

00:56:03.583 --> 00:56:05.665
I would say my goodbyes quickly.

00:56:07.917 --> 00:56:08.952
Mr qin,

00:56:09.958 --> 00:56:11.994
your daughter's time is up!

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
No, stop!

00:56:13.125 --> 00:56:14.615
- No, please.
- Cut her head down!

00:56:20.333 --> 00:56:21.118
What's going on?

00:56:21.125 --> 00:56:22.331
Stop!

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.740
Look at your chest.

00:56:26.708 --> 00:56:27.948
Drop the gun,

00:56:27.958 --> 00:56:29.573
tell everybody drop their guns!

00:56:29.583 --> 00:56:30.698
Nobody gets hurt.

00:56:32.375 --> 00:56:33.911
Everybody drop your guns.

00:56:59.292 --> 00:57:00.532
I'm standing on bouncing mines!

00:57:03.292 --> 00:57:04.407
Block all the gates!

00:57:06.208 --> 00:57:07.208
Hit the deck!

00:57:37.708 --> 00:57:39.323
Kaixuan, we've no time!

00:57:39.667 --> 00:57:40.747
Let's deal with the vest first.

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:42.206
Don't worry about me, just go!

00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:43.618
Cut the bullshit!

00:57:54.375 --> 00:57:55.535
They're so sneaky.

00:57:55.708 --> 00:57:57.188
Whichever wire I cut will set it off.

00:57:57.625 --> 00:57:58.625
Just leave.

00:58:00.792 --> 00:58:02.752
I can deactivate the bomb
by freezing the battery.

00:58:14.667 --> 00:58:15.667
Now the bouncing mines!

00:58:16.083 --> 00:58:18.119
Kaixuan, there's nothing you can do.

00:58:18.375 --> 00:58:19.935
You have a son. You need to stay alive.

00:58:20.208 --> 00:58:22.073
Just go! Run!

00:58:22.417 --> 00:58:23.122
Take your feet off,

00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:24.925
the mines will bounce
up and explode mid-air,

00:58:24.958 --> 00:58:26.518
decimating everything within 14 metres.

00:58:52.708 --> 00:58:53.823
Jianping, behind you!

00:59:11.042 --> 00:59:12.042
Yanlong!

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.034
You go first.

00:59:13.042 --> 00:59:14.042
Okay.

00:59:16.917 --> 00:59:17.997
On my count of three,

00:59:18.333 --> 00:59:19.333
jump!

00:59:19.792 --> 00:59:20.792
One,

00:59:21.042 --> 00:59:22.042
two,

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:23.072
three,

00:59:23.417 --> 00:59:24.417
jump!

00:59:39.583 --> 00:59:40.583
Let's go.

00:59:42.083 --> 00:59:43.083
Over there!

00:59:44.042 --> 00:59:45.703
Shoot him down!

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:06.243
Go help fareeda!

01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:23.333
Go!

01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:25.667
Stay with me.

01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:31.167
Go!

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:38.410
I can't be shot.

01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:41.286
Me neither!

01:00:42.958 --> 01:00:44.539
They're over here!

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.208
Here.

01:00:56.542 --> 01:00:57.156
Go!

01:00:57.167 --> 01:00:58.167
Move!

01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:03.167
Don't move.

01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:04.958
Catch it.

01:01:14.875 --> 01:01:15.875
Pull out!

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.410
Come...

01:01:21.417 --> 01:01:22.748
We need everyone!

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.490
On the double!

01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:26.160
Omar needs help!

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.740
Mohammed, come with me.

01:01:30.708 --> 01:01:32.164
Block all the exits!

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.036
Hold your positions

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:35.243
and lock the gate!

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:52.989
What are you doing?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.160
Get off!

01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:06.333
Are you alright?

01:02:06.542 --> 01:02:07.076
I'm fine.

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:08.083
Let's go.

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:11.282
Abati and Mohammed are just blocks away

01:02:11.292 --> 01:02:12.873
on their way to pick you up.

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:18.455
This way,

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:19.583
quick!

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:28.493
Yanlong, cover me.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.500
Copy!

01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:34.042
Go!

01:02:40.458 --> 01:02:41.458
Move!

01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:43.617
Take this.

01:02:44.083 --> 01:02:45.083
Move him!

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:48.375
Hang in there!

01:02:48.708 --> 01:02:49.708
Let's go!

01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:53.083
Zhou, pull out!

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Go.

01:02:56.417 --> 01:02:57.417
Get in, quick!

01:02:57.667 --> 01:02:58.667
Get in.

01:03:06.125 --> 01:03:07.410
Pull out, I'll cover!

01:03:07.625 --> 01:03:08.625
Copy!

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:16.167
Get in, quick!

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:20.699
Go, go, go...

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.500
Go!

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:31.333
Rpg!

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Kaixuan!

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:48.957
I can't detect kaixuan's vital signs.

01:03:49.708 --> 01:03:51.790
His vital signs are gone!

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:57.958
Go, come on.

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:02.285
They're closing in.

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:04.374
We need to go now or be trapped.

01:04:08.333 --> 01:04:10.039
I'll find kaixuan and bring him back.

01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:12.823
Sure, be safe!

01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:13.538
Cover him!

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:14.583
Yes, sir!

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.739
Yanlong,

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:25.750
are you alright?

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:27.917
- I'm okay.
- Let's go.

01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:34.458
Kaixuan!

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:53.625
Hurry up.

01:04:57.708 --> 01:04:59.619
Hang in there, bro!

01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:09.875
Pull out!

01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:16.040
Go now or it'll be too late!

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.364
Go, let's go!

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:25.285
They just want me!

01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:26.031
Qin!

01:05:26.042 --> 01:05:26.997
You all leave!

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.035
Come back!

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:29.497
Dad!

01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:30.326
Go back!

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:32.073
- You come back!
- Stop, stop!

01:05:32.417 --> 01:05:33.327
Come back!

01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:35.039
Take my daughter out of here! Quick!

01:05:35.167 --> 01:05:36.577
Remember our deal.

01:05:38.292 --> 01:05:40.499
Dad, don't...

01:05:40.875 --> 01:05:41.875
Dad.

01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:43.208
Dad!

01:05:43.292 --> 01:05:43.872
Get in.

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:45.035
Quick - come on

01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:57.452
Nobody shoots!

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:14.250
Hang in there!

01:06:28.083 --> 01:06:30.415
Buddy, don't die on me.

01:06:30.417 --> 01:06:31.417
Stay alive!

01:06:33.708 --> 01:06:35.244
Kaixuan, wake up!

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:44.702
Remember your son jiahua.

01:06:45.917 --> 01:06:48.249
You said you'd be his hero.

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.911
You promised!

01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:52.123
Wake up now!

01:06:52.917 --> 01:06:54.327
C'm on!

01:06:56.542 --> 01:06:58.123
Kaixuan, wake up.

01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:04.618
Wake up, you hear me?

01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:23.243
Hold tight! Take cover!

01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:45.542
Hold tight!

01:08:33.708 --> 01:08:36.165
Stop, dear...

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.536
Thanks to my rollercoaster ride!

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:07.624
Did you just kiss me?

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:12.036
I'm all yours now!

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:25.407
My son gave me this.

01:09:27.833 --> 01:09:29.118
Our son is the best!

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:43.161
Relax, your father will be fine.

01:09:43.792 --> 01:09:44.792
They need him alive.

01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:49.328
I know where to find them.

01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:04.865
Tracking device.

01:10:09.542 --> 01:10:11.578
I don't like torture

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.118
as much as I don't like bullshit.

01:10:17.292 --> 01:10:19.374
Did you betray my father?

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.750
No.

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:23.623
Where is the gold?

01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:25.667
Dubai.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:27.581
I'll take you there.

01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:29.073
Don't hurt me.

01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:48.369
Omar's father paid a deposit

01:10:48.375 --> 01:10:50.491
on weapons of mass destruction.

01:10:50.667 --> 01:10:53.454
But he was killed before
the deal went through.

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:57.080
They have more than
$200m stowed somewhere in Dubai

01:10:57.542 --> 01:11:00.329
we'll have to catch them
in the act of making the deal.

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:03.329
Based on your intel information
of the arctic wolves,

01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:06.291
we found information on
every arctic wolves mercenary.

01:11:06.542 --> 01:11:07.952
Two of them entered Dubai this morning,

01:11:07.958 --> 01:11:09.914
and they are under our surveillance.

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:14.366
We cannot confirm if they are
connected with the kidnapping of qin

01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:15.743
or the arms deal.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:18.989
Sir,

01:11:19.167 --> 01:11:20.873
can we carry firearms?

01:11:20.917 --> 01:11:21.656
No,

01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:25.034
you will be only assisting
and consulting with the investigation.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.490
All field operations here

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.832
are going to be carried out
by our police force.

01:11:29.292 --> 01:11:30.452
You understand Chinese?

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.364
I can understand,

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:33.873
though I don't speak much.

01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:35.740
My wife is Chinese.

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:38.118
Chinese!

01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:39.240
Must be beautiful.

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:40.490
Absolutely.

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:53.539
This is marder.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:56.823
He's a serial womaniser.

01:11:57.042 --> 01:11:58.873
Loves dating models and
small-time actresses.

01:11:59.125 --> 01:12:01.241
He has a violent temper.

01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:02.535
Arrested last year

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:04.073
for beating up a girlfriend.

01:12:06.333 --> 01:12:07.823
A typical scumbag!

01:12:14.583 --> 01:12:16.699
I'll see you at the pool this afternoon.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.994
Best if we can hack his phones

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.206
and credit cards.

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:21.414
Then we can find out more.

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:22.622
No problem.

01:12:22.833 --> 01:12:25.745
But they are careful and alert,

01:12:25.917 --> 01:12:27.077
hard to infiltrate.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.366
How about a honeytrap?

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:41.833
Brilliant!

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:45.869
Why are you staring at me?

01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:48.287
Didn't you always say I'm one of the boys?

01:12:49.042 --> 01:12:49.952
I can't wait to beat up

01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:51.289
that scumbag!

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.032
Forget honeytrap,

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:56.833
not me!

01:13:01.083 --> 01:13:02.083
Kaixuan,

01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:04.289
how about you?

01:13:10.917 --> 01:13:13.033
Not taking any chances huh?

01:13:14.667 --> 01:13:16.532
Change the pose.

01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:19.289
Great, a little more.

01:13:20.875 --> 01:13:22.490
Good. Stroke your hair.

01:13:22.958 --> 01:13:24.914
Good. Nice posture.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.373
A little more, great!

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:28.411
Not a bad conference room for the day.

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:30.625
I'm with you on that.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:32.823
Wonderful!

01:13:32.833 --> 01:13:33.833
Turn around...

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:41.455
Great!

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:42.743
Sweet!

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.832
Great pose! Hold it right there...

01:13:54.667 --> 01:13:56.498
Very good, the lighting is beautiful.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.081
Let's take a few more photos

01:14:00.167 --> 01:14:03.284
the merchandise must be
delivered to Dubai in two days.

01:14:03.542 --> 01:14:06.079
Can you guarantee
its safe passage into the port?

01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:06.742
Yes!

01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:09.449
Our goods doesn't even
have to enter the port.

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:12.450
It can be controlled remotely.

01:14:12.458 --> 01:14:14.619
But you've delayed it for one year.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.072
So if you want to finish the deal,
it's still $200m.

01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:21.083
Only cash.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.323
You'll get what you pay for.

01:14:30.958 --> 01:14:32.494
I'll get back to you shortly.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.500
Sure.

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:35.705
We are almost done here.

01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:37.073
Let's shoot some more at the beach.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:39.039
Darling, let's get changed first.

01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:45.038
How's it going?

01:14:45.042 --> 01:14:46.031
He works for Josef,

01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:48.203
a major arms dealer in the middle east.

01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:50.324
Let's find ways to hack their phones.

01:14:54.917 --> 01:14:55.917
What's happening?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:56.785
I believe the three asians

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:59.249
have been taking pictures of you.

01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:00.917
Darling,

01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:03.073
we need to hurry to catch the light.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:04.708
Sure.

01:15:10.292 --> 01:15:12.157
Hi, good day!

01:15:18.458 --> 01:15:19.914
To the beach now. Light's fading.

01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:22.164
So much for your honeytrap!

01:15:22.167 --> 01:15:23.373
Dressing up like this

01:15:23.542 --> 01:15:24.281
and he still ignores me.

01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:25.702
Don't you think she's beautiful?

01:15:25.792 --> 01:15:26.497
Of course.

01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:28.032
So gorgeous I can't even bear to look!

01:15:28.042 --> 01:15:28.576
Keep walking.

01:15:28.583 --> 01:15:29.698
He's watching us from the balcony.

01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:30.708
Good

01:15:30.833 --> 01:15:31.948
who are they?

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:34.366
They are still taking
pictures on the beach.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:35.750
So?

01:15:36.167 --> 01:15:37.828
I think they are clean.

01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:39.994
You just kill my chances.

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.615
I could have got lucky tonight.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.865
I'm sorry.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:46.073
I have to be careful.

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.032
Let's do it one more time.

01:15:49.208 --> 01:15:51.415
Good, keep on,

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:52.657
let your dress flutters.

01:15:55.292 --> 01:15:56.292
Got it.

01:15:58.583 --> 01:16:00.539
See, aren't they great?

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:02.206
All is not lost.

01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:05.493
Korean?

01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:09.539
I'm Chinese.

01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:11.167
Chinese!

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:13.164
Beautiful pictures.

01:16:13.292 --> 01:16:13.872
Thanks.

01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:15.581
Can I take your wechat?

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:16.750
Hello...

01:16:17.083 --> 01:16:18.789
I am her agent. Can I help you?

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:20.706
A middle-eastern
swimwear brand I invested in...

01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:23.120
To copy, just place your phone next to his.

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:26.075
I think it could be very fit for her.

01:16:26.208 --> 01:16:27.823
You can add my wechat.

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.161

01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:45.035

01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:46.042
A copy is made.

01:16:57.542 --> 01:17:00.033
The aircraft carrier USS John c. Stennis

01:17:00.042 --> 01:17:01.907
arrives today at port rashid

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:03.623

01:17:03.625 --> 01:17:05.707
in the United Arab Emirates.

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:08.870
Live from the aircraft carrier,
captain Greg dawes.

01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.119
They want $200m.

01:17:12.542 --> 01:17:14.203
It has to be in cash.

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:16.323
I'll pay in gold.

01:17:25.042 --> 01:17:27.704
An eye for an eye, mr dawes!

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:46.823
The weather is clear.

01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:49.033
There are only seagulls, no falcons.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:51.993
It's safe.

01:17:57.167 --> 01:17:59.374
We've taken care of the
police surveillance.

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:01.115
We'll see every move they make.

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:03.081
Tell them the exchange location.

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:04.493
We pay on delivery.

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:07.208
It's dad!

01:18:08.667 --> 01:18:10.032
Turn on the sound,

01:18:10.042 --> 01:18:11.452
monitor marder's phone.

01:18:20.875 --> 01:18:23.992
Sir, the location is
a second-hand car dealership.

01:18:24.917 --> 01:18:26.999
Send a team there at once.

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:28.167
Yes, sir!

01:18:30.292 --> 01:18:31.292
Watch him.

01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:42.458
They are on their way.

01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:47.615
How much is this?

01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:49.785
About 2.2m dirham.

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.869
That's about rmb 4m.

01:18:52.042 --> 01:18:54.749
This special edition
costs rmb 10m in China.

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:56.539
It's a bargain!

01:18:56.542 --> 01:18:57.497
I'll take one.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.785
Okay, they're coming.

01:19:07.917 --> 01:19:08.917
They're here.

01:19:26.292 --> 01:19:27.782
Get SWAT in position.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.500
Move it.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.240
Where's the gold?

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:41.831
Boss, they're here.

01:19:46.167 --> 01:19:47.782
Finally we meet.

01:19:48.667 --> 01:19:49.952
Good timing.

01:19:50.333 --> 01:19:51.448
Watching from the sideline,

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:52.698
a real bummer!

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:55.958
Not for long...

01:20:30.917 --> 01:20:32.248
Each gold car

01:20:32.417 --> 01:20:35.375
is worth over one hundred million dollars.

01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:39.080
The windows, the tires,
are all bullet-proof.

01:20:42.333 --> 01:20:44.540
You may pick two cars.

01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:47.537
Consider the extra money a gratuity.

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:50.115
I love them!

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:53.536
But how do I get them out of Dubai?

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:55.331
It shouldn't be a problem.

01:20:57.625 --> 01:21:00.162
This car has foil on it.

01:21:00.667 --> 01:21:02.328
It's gold underneath.

01:21:02.417 --> 01:21:04.282
Choose any colour,

01:21:04.458 --> 01:21:06.369
put a license plate on,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.536
and you're good to go.

01:21:11.125 --> 01:21:12.865
I have my present,

01:21:17.292 --> 01:21:18.292
here's yours.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:22.367
It will take down anything within 20km.

01:21:22.375 --> 01:21:24.491
This is called flash mob.

01:21:24.667 --> 01:21:26.703
The aircraft carrier is docked

01:21:26.708 --> 01:21:29.165
which makes it vulnerable to attack.

01:21:29.167 --> 01:21:31.954
Its automated system is so fast,

01:21:31.958 --> 01:21:33.323
by the time you launch,

01:21:33.333 --> 01:21:35.369
it's too late for them to respond.

01:21:36.583 --> 01:21:38.949
That's why our machine is so expensive.

01:21:39.667 --> 01:21:41.077
How do I operate it?

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:42.250
Easy!

01:21:42.792 --> 01:21:44.282
It's like a game controller.

01:21:44.292 --> 01:21:45.292
Activate,

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:46.990
lock in the target there,

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.615
then press launch.

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:50.208
There.

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:55.617
The us army was responsible for the bombing

01:21:55.625 --> 01:21:58.788
that killed maasym
and the rest of Omar's family.

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:02.457
The USS John c. Stennis
is currently in Dubai.

01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:05.905
Captain Greg dawes was the commander
of the search and destroy operation.

01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:08.624
There is no surprise Omar wants revenge.

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:10.456
Go tell the us military immediately.

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:11.458
Yes, sir!

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:14.490
You said you'd let me go.

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:15.831
I lied.

01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:19.245
Just like you lied to my father.

01:22:20.208 --> 01:22:21.914
I know you betrayed him,

01:22:21.917 --> 01:22:23.578
and I'm making sure

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.956
you get what you deserve.

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:29.078
Lei, take her to the police hq.

01:22:30.292 --> 01:22:31.748
All units standby!

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.581
Fareeda, it's dangerous.

01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:39.322
All the way,

01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:40.664
from Africa to the middle east,

01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:41.913
as long as you were by my side,

01:22:41.917 --> 01:22:43.532
I came through everything unscathed.

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:46.410
Please come with me.

01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:48.161
I have a duty to protect you!

01:22:50.625 --> 01:22:53.367
Isn't it your duty
to protect my father as well?

01:22:54.958 --> 01:22:56.414
I can't lose my father.

01:22:59.167 --> 01:23:00.907
Unless you knock me out with tranquilliser,

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:02.831
I won't go with you.

01:23:11.917 --> 01:23:13.828
Alright, gentlemen, this is not a drill.

01:23:13.833 --> 01:23:14.913
What's the status?

01:23:14.958 --> 01:23:16.539
We have a possible hostile attack.

01:23:16.917 --> 01:23:18.282
Turn around - go back

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:21.792
go, go, go - that way

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:25.532
grab your weapons!

01:23:28.917 --> 01:23:30.703
This is the hostage we need to save.

01:24:02.667 --> 01:24:03.667
Move!

01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:09.125
Let's go!

01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:22.455
Hostage's in the gold Hummer.

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:23.458
Come with me.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:45.115
You both have your own gears.
What about me?

01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:46.448
You've got this truck.

01:24:46.958 --> 01:24:47.958
See you later.

01:25:00.167 --> 01:25:01.247
Hey! Stop!

01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:02.080
Don't move!

01:25:02.083 --> 01:25:03.198
Freeze!

01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:06.706
Turn around!

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.831
Hands behind your head!

01:25:16.542 --> 01:25:18.328
Warning red, weapons tight,

01:25:18.333 --> 01:25:20.039
and prepare f35!

01:25:31.333 --> 01:25:34.746
Unknown airborne object
has been detected, 2-3-2,

01:25:34.792 --> 01:25:36.578
approximately 16,000 yards.

01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:38.330
What the hell is that?

01:26:24.208 --> 01:26:24.822
Firel

01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:25.993
two, one, firing!

01:27:31.917 --> 01:27:32.917
She's on my team.

01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:01.785
I teach her.

01:28:10.542 --> 01:28:11.542
Don't move!

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:18.583
Condor!

01:28:18.708 --> 01:28:19.993
How many people have you trained?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Many, many...

01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:17.083
Go, go, go!

01:29:35.542 --> 01:29:36.542
Out of the way!

01:29:37.917 --> 01:29:38.917
Move, move!

01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:40.250
Secure the exit!

01:29:43.417 --> 01:29:44.827
What have we just missed?

01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:51.994
Watch out, watch out!

01:29:54.958 --> 01:29:55.958
Sit down!

01:30:09.417 --> 01:30:10.748
Stay back, stay back.

01:30:11.375 --> 01:30:12.740
C'mon, get up, get up!

01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:13.865
Don't move!

01:30:13.958 --> 01:30:15.949
Back off! I say back off now!

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.080
Back off!

01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:19.073
Get down! I say get down!

01:30:19.208 --> 01:30:20.208
Get down!

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:24.081
We need backup.

01:30:27.792 --> 01:30:28.952
- There!
- Gol!

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.456
- Stay here.
- Be careful.

01:30:32.583 --> 01:30:33.948
- Stay down!
- Move!

01:30:46.542 --> 01:30:47.542
Go somewhere safe.

01:30:49.292 --> 01:30:50.292
Come on!

01:30:56.375 --> 01:30:57.080
Wait,

01:30:57.083 --> 01:30:58.289
stairs are over there!

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.573
- That's great!
- Come, come.

01:31:00.083 --> 01:31:00.913
Stay where you are.

01:31:00.917 --> 01:31:01.622
Come

01:31:01.625 --> 01:31:02.956
move - get down! Don't move!

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:04.702
- Get away!
- Move!

01:31:05.417 --> 01:31:06.417
Move!

01:31:08.333 --> 01:31:10.289
- Get off! Get off!
- Get away!

01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:15.875
- Move!
- Get away!

01:31:22.875 --> 01:31:24.991
Don't move. Nobody moves!

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.615
Get down, don't move...

01:31:29.292 --> 01:31:30.292
Nobody...

01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:38.831
Why did you shoot yourself?

01:31:59.667 --> 01:32:00.531
Hands up!

01:32:00.542 --> 01:32:01.542
Hands in the air!

01:32:15.958 --> 01:32:16.788
Where's Omar?

01:32:16.792 --> 01:32:17.406
Down there.

01:32:17.417 --> 01:32:18.907
- Dad!
- Fareeda!

01:32:21.917 --> 01:32:23.123
How did he get down there?

01:32:23.125 --> 01:32:24.125
I don't know!

01:32:24.625 --> 01:32:25.625
Hands up!

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:26.989
Drop the gun!

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.706
Wait, he's one of us.

01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:32.583
You can go!

01:32:33.125 --> 01:32:34.706
Thank you for your cooperation.

01:32:34.708 --> 01:32:35.743
Peace be upon you!

01:32:38.625 --> 01:32:39.625
It's all over now.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.616
An update on the attack yesterday in Dubai.

01:32:46.625 --> 01:32:49.492
The police have officially
reported 15 injuries,

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.740
no casualties.

01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:54.072
Two f/a-18 and one f35 were destroyed.

01:32:54.083 --> 01:32:58.156
It is all because the Dubai police provided
accurate intels to the us military.

01:32:58.167 --> 01:32:59.327
All related to the attack

01:32:59.333 --> 01:33:01.119
have been arrested by the Dubai police.

01:33:01.125 --> 01:33:03.957
And in addition the police
have retrieved seven gold cars

01:33:03.958 --> 01:33:06.324
worth more than 800 million dollars!

01:33:37.417 --> 01:33:38.156
Good evening!

01:33:38.167 --> 01:33:39.407
Good evening, mr tang.

01:33:39.417 --> 01:33:40.156
How are you?

01:33:40.167 --> 01:33:42.032
Let me introduce my wife.

01:33:42.625 --> 01:33:43.535
Mrs hattawi.

01:33:43.542 --> 01:33:45.157
Mr tang, nice to meet you.

01:33:45.375 --> 01:33:46.581
Your wife is just so...

01:33:46.583 --> 01:33:47.583
Beautiful.

01:33:48.167 --> 01:33:49.156
Elegant too!

01:33:49.167 --> 01:33:50.327
I heard from my husband

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:51.789
that thanks tovanguard

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:53.373
for their timely and vital info,

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.242
damages were kept to a minimal.

01:33:56.417 --> 01:33:57.417
The way that

01:33:57.542 --> 01:33:59.248
your husband has led the Dubai police

01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:01.036
was a real eye-opener for us.

01:34:01.667 --> 01:34:04.704
I am the one actually
impressed by your amazing team!

01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:05.868
All in the line of duty!

01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:06.785
Hey, guys,

01:34:06.792 --> 01:34:07.998
well done!

01:34:24.208 --> 01:34:26.073
- How do you do?
- Thank you, vanguard

01:34:30.333 --> 01:34:32.289
don't you have something for her?

01:34:34.125 --> 01:34:36.036
How did you know, sir?

01:34:36.042 --> 01:34:37.532
Nothing escapes me!

01:34:37.875 --> 01:34:38.875
Go on.

01:34:40.042 --> 01:34:41.077
Get out of here!

01:34:47.833 --> 01:34:49.573
What have you got for me?

01:34:49.958 --> 01:34:50.958
Wait.

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:15.375
Great!

01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:19.538
That's amazing!

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.115
Mission accomplished.

01:35:24.208 --> 01:35:25.323
Hope you liked it.

01:35:26.292 --> 01:35:27.407
Yes, I love it.

01:35:35.792 --> 01:35:36.792
Thank you.

01:35:36.833 --> 01:35:38.118
Don't thank us,

01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:39.831
thank the bees!

01:35:45.333 --> 01:35:46.333
Look!

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.206
Chinese new year!

01:35:48.667 --> 01:35:49.827
Lantern festival!

01:35:50.792 --> 01:35:52.328
Let's take a photo together.

01:35:52.333 --> 01:35:53.618
Sure - come

01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:54.958
come on...

01:36:05.625 --> 01:36:07.456
Happy new year!

01:36:07.458 --> 01:36:09.574
Prosperity and good health to all!

01:39:05.625 --> 01:39:06.990
I was like this...

01:39:07.208 --> 01:39:10.041
The jet ski pinned me!

01:39:10.375 --> 01:39:11.330
I can't push it up,

01:39:11.375 --> 01:39:12.535
and can't move either.
