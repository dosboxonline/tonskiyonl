00:01.479 --> 00:03.090
[Ragnar]
Previously onVikings...

00:03.264 --> 00:05.005
Igor, I love you like a son.

00:05.179 --> 00:06.832
If we don't kill him,
you will never be free.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.443
No! [gasps]

00:10.445 --> 00:13.578
If anyone steps foot
on my land, they will die!

00:13.752 --> 00:15.493
Come! Ubbe! Away!

00:15.667 --> 00:17.582
Come back!

00:17.756 --> 00:19.802
[Ubbe] Get on the boat! Move!

00:19.976 --> 00:21.934
I go now to join Bjorn
in Valhalla.

00:22.109 --> 00:22.979
Gunnhild!

00:23.153 --> 00:24.024
Let her be.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.334
We have no idea where we are.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.032
And we have no food.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.034
The truth is that
we are probably going to die!

00:34.208 --> 00:35.296
So, are you coming with me?

00:35.470 --> 00:37.211
Where to?

00:37.385 --> 00:38.864
We don't know what happened
there since Bjorn died.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.040
Then we'll find out.

00:40.214 --> 00:40.953
Ivar!

00:41.128 --> 00:42.042
I love you.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.566
You've changed.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.569
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:19.818 --> 01:23.866
[vocalizing]

01:36.574 --> 01:39.055
-[horn blaring]
-[man] A ship in the harbor!

01:40.100 --> 01:41.231
[man] Janus!

01:41.405 --> 01:43.190
[chattering]

01:43.581 --> 01:45.496
[horn blaring]

01:46.628 --> 01:48.760
[man] Hurry! To the water!

01:50.240 --> 01:51.111
[man] Here!

01:53.591 --> 01:55.158
[horn blaring continues]

01:59.119 --> 02:00.511
[horn blaring continues]

02:04.428 --> 02:05.342
[woman] It's one ship!

02:06.604 --> 02:07.649
What is it?

02:09.433 --> 02:11.348
Uh, it's a Rus ship.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.221
There's only a single ship.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.402
Then escort it
into the harbor.

02:32.064 --> 02:34.632
[Hvitserk] So, we're home.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.419
What are you
thinking about, huh?

02:40.421 --> 02:43.119
That this might be
a mistake, after all.

02:46.818 --> 02:49.169
[man 1] Scum! Liar!

02:49.343 --> 02:51.432
[crowd shouting]

02:53.782 --> 02:56.741
[man 2]
You're a fool and a false god!

02:56.915 --> 02:59.570
[woman]
You're a traitor and a coward!

02:59.744 --> 03:00.745
[man 3] Spineless!

03:01.833 --> 03:02.965
Scum!

03:11.713 --> 03:12.627
[man 4] Traitor!

03:12.801 --> 03:14.324
[man 5] Go back, you swine!

03:17.414 --> 03:18.546
You pigs!

03:22.332 --> 03:23.159
[man 6] Liar!

03:23.333 --> 03:25.205
[crowd quiets]

03:40.394 --> 03:42.222
Follow me.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.919
I'll take you
to King Harald.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.403
King Harald?

04:19.476 --> 04:20.912
[breathing heavily]

04:25.439 --> 04:27.005
All hail to you,

04:27.179 --> 04:28.311
King Harald Finehair.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.184
All hail.

04:35.013 --> 04:37.494
My wife, Queen Ingrid.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.151
Queen Ingrid.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.502
I hope that
you will give safe passage

04:45.676 --> 04:48.200
to the Rus sailors
that brought us here.

04:49.158 --> 04:51.247
Of course.

04:51.421 --> 04:55.251
We didn't expect to find you
here enthroned, King Harald.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.253
And, for my part,

04:58.254 --> 04:59.603
I [exhales] never thought

04:59.777 --> 05:02.171
that my first visitors
would be you two.

05:04.695 --> 05:07.307
The gods work
in mysterious ways.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.700
They do, indeed,

05:09.874 --> 05:11.049
Ivar, the Boneless.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.403
What brought you back?

05:16.577 --> 05:17.752
This is our home.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.101
You were fighting
with the Rus.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.494
To reclaim our home.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.365
From your own brother.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.584
Brothers fall out.

05:25.499 --> 05:28.415
They may even end up
fighting on different sides.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.721
You know that too well,

05:31.592 --> 05:32.506
King Harald.

05:38.642 --> 05:41.384
Many of the townsfolk
hate you.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.953
As long as you remain here,
you will be in danger.

05:45.127 --> 05:48.565
We are the legitimate sons
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.611
You can't tell me
that the people of Kattegat

05:50.785 --> 05:53.527
don't still revere
and worship our father.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.834
[Ivar] And if they're willing
to accept you as their king,

05:57.008 --> 05:58.793
surely they'll be
willing to accept us

05:58.967 --> 06:01.317
as your supporters.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.667
If you truly
are my supporters.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.806
[inhales and exhales deeply]

06:11.980 --> 06:16.027
Your arrival may strengthen
my position here.

06:16.201 --> 06:19.248
Make it more legitimate,
as you say.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.255
I think
we should have a feast

06:26.429 --> 06:28.388
to celebrate this new

06:28.562 --> 06:30.520
and unexpected accord.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.566
The sons of Ragnar
have returned home

06:32.740 --> 06:34.829
to support
the new regime.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.874
All is well with the world.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.180
[chuckles]

06:39.311 --> 06:40.400
Wouldn't you agree?

06:53.456 --> 06:54.457
[woman coughing]

06:59.201 --> 07:00.332
[exhales]

07:20.701 --> 07:21.963
What are you doing?

07:23.617 --> 07:25.923
It's not for me,
it's for my wife.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.534
She's sick.
She needs some water.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.146
I'm sorry.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.582
We have to share
the water equally.

07:32.756 --> 07:33.844
We couldn't make exceptions.

07:34.671 --> 07:35.846
What if she dies?

07:37.979 --> 07:39.633
I'm sorry.

07:39.807 --> 07:40.590
There's no other way.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.259
[boat creaking]

07:59.261 --> 08:00.741
[indistinct chattering]

08:36.733 --> 08:38.518
[chattering stops]

08:38.692 --> 08:40.520
[man] There's no shame
to come back here.

08:46.090 --> 08:46.961
[sniffs sharply]

08:51.313 --> 08:52.270
Tonight...

08:53.663 --> 08:55.491
we have much to celebrate.

08:58.407 --> 09:02.542
Two of Ragnar's sons
have returned home.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.805
They were free men,
they could have chosen

09:04.979 --> 09:06.807
to go anywhere in our world

09:06.981 --> 09:09.549
where their fame
would have guaranteed them

09:09.723 --> 09:11.638
a warm welcome.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.422
Instead,

09:13.596 --> 09:15.729
they returned to Kattegat,

09:15.903 --> 09:16.947
to their beginnings.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.126
I can see that

09:23.737 --> 09:26.653
many of you are not
in favor of their return.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.568
[people jeering]

09:36.271 --> 09:39.840
You have bitter memories.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.624
You feel betrayed.

09:41.798 --> 09:42.973
[people murmuring]

09:44.148 --> 09:45.672
But let me remind you,

09:45.846 --> 09:49.414
that the gods
always forgive each other.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.547
Well, not always.
They couldn't forgive

09:51.721 --> 09:54.245
Loki's murder of Balder,
Odin's son.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.683
But the exception
proves the rule!

09:56.857 --> 09:58.293
For the most parts,

09:58.467 --> 10:01.470
gods, being human,
understands human nature.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.080
They understand jealousy.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.821
They understand ambition.

10:04.995 --> 10:08.695
They understand how people
who love each other

10:08.869 --> 10:10.218
can end up challenging

10:10.392 --> 10:12.263
and sometimes
murdering those they love!

10:12.437 --> 10:13.351
I did it myself.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.789
I killed my own brother!

10:17.312 --> 10:19.619
And I regret it every day!

10:20.315 --> 10:21.577
Every day.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.801
Ivar regrets

10:27.975 --> 10:29.803
the way he ruled here.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.195
He was young.

10:33.415 --> 10:36.113
The responsibility
was too great

10:36.287 --> 10:38.768
and he forgot
the lessons of his father.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.643
And his brother, Hvitserk...

10:43.817 --> 10:46.080
He never meant
to kill Lagertha.

10:46.254 --> 10:49.039
How could he ever mean
to kill such a goddess!

10:49.213 --> 10:51.172
[people shouting]

10:51.346 --> 10:55.655
They have both
confessed their sorrows

10:57.047 --> 10:58.570
and their mistakes.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.749
And they have come here

11:04.228 --> 11:07.405
to be judged
by their own people.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.103
They are who they are,

11:09.277 --> 11:12.193
but they are also
sons of Ragnar.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.718
And we should be overjoyed

11:15.892 --> 11:18.678
that they have decided
to come here

11:18.852 --> 11:21.550
and share their future
with us.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.683
[people mumble indistinctly]

11:36.957 --> 11:39.307
So, tell us, Ivar,

11:39.481 --> 11:43.703
is it true you're a god
like you told us?

11:59.066 --> 12:00.284
[effort grunts]

12:27.616 --> 12:29.139
[people gasping]

12:41.804 --> 12:43.893
[laughs]

12:44.067 --> 12:45.939
[all laughing]

13:11.878 --> 13:13.009
[grunting]

13:25.805 --> 13:27.241
[traditional music playing]

13:39.775 --> 13:40.776
[Ivar] You did well.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.996
Well, thank you.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.476
I tried to speak the truth.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.914
No one's really
interested in the truth.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.393
On the contrary.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.266
No. Hvitserk is right.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.659
This has nothing to do
with the truth.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.967
You're all used to having
power and influence,

13:58.141 --> 13:59.882
but there can only be
one king here.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.798
And in times of peace,

14:02.972 --> 14:05.670
and if the Rus do not
intend to attack us again,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.020
what will you all do?

14:09.849 --> 14:13.026
You are men
who are easily bored.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.942
Who crave excitements
and challenges.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.466
What is left for you to do

14:18.640 --> 14:21.861
except to fall out
and quarrel?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.487
[laughing]

14:45.014 --> 14:46.233
A good night?

14:48.365 --> 14:50.367
A great night.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.979
-Hail Ivar!
-Yes!

14:53.153 --> 14:54.197
Hail Ivar!

14:54.371 --> 14:56.156
-Hail Hvitserk!
-Hail Hvitserk!

14:56.330 --> 14:57.940
-Hail Ragnar!
-Hail Ragnar!

14:58.114 --> 15:00.160
-Hail Ragnar!
-[both laughing]

15:15.523 --> 15:16.698
[metal clanking]

15:21.181 --> 15:22.704
What is it now, huh?

15:25.707 --> 15:27.665
I don't know.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.929
[scoffs]
I don't know what to do.

15:35.238 --> 15:35.935
[exhales]

15:37.414 --> 15:39.155
What do you mean?

15:39.329 --> 15:42.376
I don't think my destiny,
or yours,

15:43.029 --> 15:44.247
lies here.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.076
But then, on the other hand,

15:47.250 --> 15:49.383
I have no idea
where I'm supposed to go.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.127
It feels

15:54.301 --> 15:57.130
-as if I'm in an open boat.
-[water splashing]

15:59.306 --> 16:00.437
Lost at sea,

16:00.611 --> 16:02.483
with no land in sight.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.138
No purpose,

16:05.312 --> 16:07.705
no meaning to my voyage.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.405
Don't you ever feel the same?

16:15.278 --> 16:17.454
I've been lost
for so long.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.892
I wouldn't recognize
the alternative.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.507
[scoffs]

16:30.163 --> 16:31.773
[fire crackling]

16:37.692 --> 16:39.041
[boat creaking]

16:43.698 --> 16:44.829
Tell me, Othere,

16:46.266 --> 16:47.745
what are your
earliest memories?

16:49.182 --> 16:51.793
I don't remember anything
about my early life.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.014
That's impossible.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.495
Very well, then.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.806
I hated everything
about my childhood.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.634
I could not wait to grow up.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.549
To be older.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.378
To choose
who I wanted to be.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.034
But you were Viking.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.038
That's what you told us.

17:19.212 --> 17:21.736
I told you so that
you would be happy.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.043
You could know me.
Place me.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.741
I don't need to be comforted.

17:27.481 --> 17:28.612
Are you sure?

17:30.440 --> 17:33.052
I am growing tired
of your games

17:34.401 --> 17:36.838
and your refusal
to be honest.

17:38.796 --> 17:41.364
I look around
and I see the truth...

17:42.931 --> 17:44.063
Where we are,

17:45.020 --> 17:46.326
what has become of us.

17:48.545 --> 17:49.720
Don't tell me that
you're beginning

17:49.894 --> 17:51.113
to lose your faith, Ubbe.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.029
Not you.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.683
Surely not you.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.094
[sniffling]

18:15.268 --> 18:16.269
[whimpers]

18:26.148 --> 18:27.845
What happened?

18:28.019 --> 18:30.674
He died in the night.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.286
His mother told me
he'd been drinking sea water.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.377
[crying]

18:46.473 --> 18:47.909
May I give him this?

18:48.649 --> 18:49.824
[sobs]

18:51.347 --> 18:52.566
[sniffles]

18:58.006 --> 18:59.529
[continues weeping]

18:59.703 --> 19:03.142
[chanting in Latin]

19:09.060 --> 19:10.279
There is so little food.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.368
So little water.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.937
That poor boy
is just the first of many.

19:17.678 --> 19:18.853
I know.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.751
[Ivar] I have been away,
O Ancient One.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.452
[Seer] Oh, I have watched you.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.803
Though blind, do you imagine
that I don't see?

19:55.977 --> 19:58.501
[waves lapping]

20:01.809 --> 20:03.941
I'm not sure,
I should have returned.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.640
Harald is suspicious

20:06.814 --> 20:08.163
that I have come
to overthrow him.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.862
Perhaps I should,

20:12.036 --> 20:14.082
since I despise the thought
of serving him.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.170
[Seer chuckles]

20:17.477 --> 20:19.653
Poor Ivar.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.655
Connecting nothing
with nothing.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.007
Think of your father...

20:26.660 --> 20:27.835
Sat here,

20:28.836 --> 20:30.446
dreaming his dreams...

20:32.405 --> 20:34.798
of places beyond all this.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.366
Don't you remember?

20:41.457 --> 20:43.111
Then here is not my fate.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.026
[Seer] I cannot advise you.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.550
But I saw in your pocket

20:47.724 --> 20:50.031
a possible answer
to your question.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.297
Ivar, the Boneless.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.689
[Hvitserk] My dear brother.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.517
How the High One
must have celebrated

21:41.691 --> 21:44.303
your arrival
in his Great Hall.

21:44.477 --> 21:47.741
How the gods must have raised
their brimming horns

21:47.915 --> 21:50.396
to salute Bjorn Ironside,

21:51.527 --> 21:52.398
son of Ragnar.

21:54.443 --> 21:55.357
When I join you,

21:56.358 --> 21:57.664
there will be no celebrations.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.018
What have I really done
in life, huh?

22:05.193 --> 22:06.325
I was a drunk,

22:07.804 --> 22:09.110
a profligate.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.722
I abandoned Ubbe,

22:13.897 --> 22:15.377
the brother I loved the most.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.033
I killed Lagertha.

22:21.514 --> 22:25.300
The only two women I've ever
loved both met miserable ends.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.305
I never married,

22:31.915 --> 22:33.352
never had any children.

22:35.528 --> 22:36.703
[sniffles]

22:36.877 --> 22:38.531
I follow Ivar around
like his shadow,

22:40.141 --> 22:42.099
and I don't even know why.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.803
The gods must despise me.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.806
But you must know all about
this by now, Bjorn.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.373
You must hear
their conversations,

22:55.548 --> 22:56.984
their laughter.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.857
Which is why a kind word
from you

23:01.031 --> 23:02.598
would only lacerate my soul.

23:04.992 --> 23:08.604
[Idun] Hvitserk, do not think
so unkindly of the gods.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.222
[Hvitserk] Who are you?

23:19.485 --> 23:20.834
Are you a ghost?

23:21.008 --> 23:23.967
No. My name is Idun.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.579
And I know all about you.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.669
I will spend tonight with you,

23:31.148 --> 23:32.411
if you desire it.

23:34.543 --> 23:37.416
[indistinct chatter]

23:40.506 --> 23:41.550
[Ivar] You have it made here.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.077
[Harald] Yes. That's
what I thought.

23:49.906 --> 23:52.909
I always imagined ruling
was my destiny.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.434
I wanted to be king
of all Norway.

23:58.524 --> 24:03.180
I even challenged
Bjorn Ironside for that title,

24:05.226 --> 24:06.923
and I cheated it
to make it mine.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.665
But now...

24:11.406 --> 24:12.842
I'm not sure I ever really

24:14.191 --> 24:15.236
wanted it after all.

24:21.111 --> 24:25.376
Being king brings
so little pleasure,

24:25.551 --> 24:28.118
so little satisfaction.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.295
Don't you agree,

24:32.775 --> 24:33.820
King Ivar?

25:15.426 --> 25:16.689
I came back here, I...

25:16.863 --> 25:21.781
thought I could
reinvent myself.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.218
-[chuckles]
-Be the person
that I once was.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.656
Be the person

25:27.830 --> 25:29.615
who wanted to rule,

25:31.921 --> 25:37.144
who wanted to do anything
to claim a throne.

25:40.887 --> 25:42.323
But sitting on that throne...

25:45.631 --> 25:46.327
means nothing.

25:52.855 --> 25:55.597
There is an illusion
of power

25:55.771 --> 25:58.905
that induces inside
you a kind of madness.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.344
Isn't that true?

26:07.435 --> 26:08.741
Isn't it true, Ivar?

26:12.005 --> 26:12.832
Admit it!

26:13.006 --> 26:16.357
Yes. Yes.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.403
It's true.

26:29.239 --> 26:32.547
[inaudible]

26:50.521 --> 26:53.829
I'm not sure I like
what I have returned to.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.746
I don't really want
to rule Kattegat.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.314
I think ruling Kattegat
will be boring.

27:03.317 --> 27:06.233
And, in the meantime,
I'm married to a witch,

27:06.407 --> 27:09.323
who I know does not love me
at all.

27:10.759 --> 27:14.633
And the woman that I love,
truly, is dead.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.636
And that may be
my fault, too.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.899
Let's not talk about love.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.773
Well, at least you have
brothers to talk to.

27:24.947 --> 27:28.429
I have no one.
I'm always alone.

27:30.605 --> 27:32.128
No.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.436
Your brother Halfdan is here.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.222
He's listening to us
right now.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.748
So is my father,

27:42.922 --> 27:44.445
my mother,
and my brothers.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.709
Everyone is around us.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.060
Don't you believe that?

27:54.803 --> 27:56.196
[sighs]

27:56.370 --> 27:57.284
Halfdan is gone.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.460
It's a long time ago now.

28:02.550 --> 28:03.943
I killed him, of course.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.818
Do you think
he would come
to visit me?

28:18.305 --> 28:19.872
I hope the gods forgive me.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.485
But I don't think
it's possible.

28:35.278 --> 28:38.499
[Idun speaking Old Norse]

28:44.157 --> 28:46.463
[Idun continues speaking]

28:51.555 --> 28:52.643
[thunder rumbling]

28:55.690 --> 28:57.605
I know who you are.

28:57.779 --> 29:01.565
Idun, the goddess blessed
with eternal youth.

29:05.656 --> 29:08.007
Odin must have
sent you to me.

29:12.185 --> 29:15.754
I am not acting
under orders.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.540
I have watched you
all your life.

29:21.368 --> 29:24.110
Shared your joys
and your pain.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.550
And so I decided
to appear to you,

29:30.464 --> 29:31.552
as you deserve.

29:35.904 --> 29:36.775
[voice trembles]
Will you stay with me?

29:38.864 --> 29:41.040
Only till the dawn.

29:41.214 --> 29:44.217
But the dawn is a long,
long way away.

29:49.962 --> 29:52.007
So weep no more,
sweet Hvitserk.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.314
Weep no more.

30:00.537 --> 30:01.582
[door closes]

30:05.673 --> 30:06.587
[exhales]

30:10.939 --> 30:12.071
[grunts]

30:16.466 --> 30:18.338
[Ragnar] People think that you
are not a threat,

30:18.512 --> 30:20.079
but I know differently.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.259
Out of all of my sons,

30:26.433 --> 30:28.914
it was you I wanted
to bring here,

30:29.088 --> 30:30.654
and it is you

30:30.829 --> 30:33.179
that I believe is
the most important

30:33.353 --> 30:34.615
to the future of our people.

30:37.618 --> 30:38.880
You do not think
like other men.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.621
You are unpredictable.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.754
[breathes heavily]

30:43.929 --> 30:45.974
Anger is a gift!

30:46.148 --> 30:48.107
What is in here is a gift!

30:52.938 --> 30:54.243
[grunts]

31:10.738 --> 31:12.435
[breathing deeply]

31:43.771 --> 31:46.078
[grunts]

31:46.252 --> 31:49.820
[Ragnar] Everyone will always
underestimate you.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.561
You must make them pay for it.

31:51.735 --> 31:54.695
Use your anger intelligently.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.566
And I promise you, my son,

31:56.740 --> 31:59.743
that one day, the whole
world will know

31:59.918 --> 32:03.486
and fear Ivar, the Boneless.

32:08.187 --> 32:09.536
Be ruthless.

32:33.995 --> 32:37.390
[rain pattering]

32:58.628 --> 33:00.239
[sobbing]

33:24.219 --> 33:25.873
[laughing]

33:44.674 --> 33:49.810
[vocalizing]

34:16.445 --> 34:20.797
[continues vocalizing]

34:38.206 --> 34:41.209
-[continues vocalizing]
-[singing in old Norse]

34:45.387 --> 34:46.127
[Othere stops singing]

35:23.817 --> 35:26.341
[indistinct chatter]

36:39.849 --> 36:40.981
[tapping]

36:43.201 --> 36:45.420
[man 1] Give me
my money!

36:45.594 --> 36:47.422
Give me my money!
Give me, give me.

36:47.596 --> 36:48.684
[man 2] You already
have it!

36:48.858 --> 36:51.644
You joker!
Give me my money!

36:51.818 --> 36:53.950
You give me
my money!

36:58.085 --> 36:59.129
You get two, unless--

37:03.351 --> 37:04.222
[man] What did you
do that for?

37:06.789 --> 37:08.051
Hey, you! Cripple!

37:11.403 --> 37:13.753
Queen Ingrid
told us that
in time of peace

37:13.927 --> 37:16.364
we would have no choice
but to fall out
with each other.

37:16.538 --> 37:17.887
It's true.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.149
No doubt that
we'd all like to deny it,

37:19.324 --> 37:21.195
but it will happen.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.720
Unless there is
still something left
for us to do together.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.202
There is,
and this is it.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.127
Please, Ragnar, drink.

37:40.301 --> 37:41.302
Please drink.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.261
He won't feed.

37:45.219 --> 37:47.134
He can't die.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.658
-Of course he can die.
-No!

37:49.832 --> 37:52.008
-It's impossible.
-You're not a god.

37:52.182 --> 37:53.706
You can't save him.

37:53.880 --> 37:54.881
[yells]

37:56.274 --> 37:58.363
This is my fault!

37:58.537 --> 38:00.495
We should never
have left Kattegat!

38:03.368 --> 38:05.239
Why are we
dying here,

38:05.413 --> 38:07.285
in the middle
of nowhere?

38:07.459 --> 38:09.243
In the middle
of the ocean?

38:09.417 --> 38:11.376
It was not
your decision, Ubbe.

38:11.550 --> 38:15.075
The gods have
brought us here. The gods
have decided our fate.

38:15.249 --> 38:20.080
Unfortunately,
Ubbe has lost his faith.

38:20.254 --> 38:22.735
He no longer believes.
Do you, Ubbe?

38:24.606 --> 38:25.390
Ubbe!

38:26.652 --> 38:28.088
Ubbe, please, no!

38:28.262 --> 38:29.742
No!

38:30.220 --> 38:31.091
Ubbe!

38:32.310 --> 38:34.399
Ubbe, no! Stop it!

38:35.443 --> 38:37.227
Don't you understand?

38:37.402 --> 38:40.100
If you behave like this,
if you try to murder
one another,

38:40.274 --> 38:43.103
then we're just like Kjetill
and those we left behind.

38:43.277 --> 38:45.105
We are no different.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.977
What is the point
in trying to find
a new land,

38:48.151 --> 38:50.458
if we behave just
the same as we did
in the old one?

38:52.112 --> 38:54.810
Ubbe, for the love
of the gods.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.133
[thunder cracks]

39:20.662 --> 39:23.143
[indistinct chatter]

39:25.058 --> 39:27.190
My friends,

39:27.365 --> 39:29.541
I have exciting news.

39:29.715 --> 39:33.806
Well, what kind of a king
would I be, if I didn't
bring you exciting news?

39:33.980 --> 39:36.330
[all laughing]

39:36.504 --> 39:41.683
King Bjorn believed that
Kattegat could exist
by trade alone.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.121
It is not true.

39:45.295 --> 39:48.124
Of course it is true
that we have
always been traders.

39:48.298 --> 39:50.170
We have gone
to the ends of the Earth

39:50.344 --> 39:53.042
to trade
with other peoples,
other cultures.

39:53.216 --> 39:56.176
But these,
our Scandinavian
countries, are small.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.308
And we don't have
that much to trade.

39:58.483 --> 40:01.877
Instead, we have
raided far and wide.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.313
[crowd shouting agreement]

40:03.488 --> 40:05.838
And our raids
have been successful.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.883
[crowd] Yes!

40:08.057 --> 40:11.887
We have a presence now
in England, in Ireland,

40:12.061 --> 40:15.195
in Frankia,
and even in Rus!

40:15.369 --> 40:17.284
[crowd] Yes!

40:17.458 --> 40:21.288
We have started
to put down roots
in all these places.

40:21.462 --> 40:26.249
And our influence has
grown out of all
proportion to our size.

40:27.903 --> 40:30.428
Unless we
continue raiding,

40:31.559 --> 40:32.908
continue to win battles,

40:33.692 --> 40:36.390
take territory,

40:36.564 --> 40:39.828
we will soon
lose everything
we have gained so far.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.355
In England,
we have a foothold in York,

40:45.530 --> 40:47.227
in Mercia, and
Northumberland.

40:47.401 --> 40:51.710
And we still
have a settlement
in Wessex,

40:51.884 --> 40:53.668
that Ubbe won for us.

40:56.062 --> 40:57.237
But Wessex

40:58.281 --> 41:00.588
remains powerful,

41:00.762 --> 41:03.373
remains the last
great kingdom of England.

41:03.548 --> 41:08.553
Its king, Alfred,
receives homage
from all Saxon tribes.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.514
And if we leave
his kingdom alone,

41:13.688 --> 41:17.300
then, surely,
he will destroy
our settlements,

41:17.475 --> 41:20.260
and regain
all his lost fiefdoms.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.265
We cannot allow it.

41:26.005 --> 41:29.182
[crowd murmuring]

41:39.845 --> 41:42.282
They tell me that
all our great heroes
are dead.

41:43.588 --> 41:45.024
And perhaps
you believe it.

41:46.460 --> 41:49.289
For it seems to me,
that while our kinsmen

41:49.463 --> 41:51.683
struggle and fight abroad,

41:51.857 --> 41:54.294
all of you have settled
for comfortable lives
here in Kattegat,

41:54.468 --> 41:58.559
living off the fat of the land,
forgetting who you really are,

41:58.733 --> 42:02.345
forgetting that
you're Vikings,

42:02.520 --> 42:06.306
the sons and daughters
of the gods, longing
for Valhalla.

42:11.529 --> 42:16.316
Is it for this
that Ragnar Lothbrok died?

42:16.490 --> 42:18.840
Is it for your easy living,
your temperate days,

42:19.014 --> 42:20.842
that he sacrificed
his life?

42:23.845 --> 42:27.022
I was there
when my father died.

42:27.196 --> 42:30.330
I watched him
wretched in his cage
above a pit of vipers.

42:30.504 --> 42:33.986
And I heard his last words.
He wanted no pity.

42:35.509 --> 42:38.294
He was glad to die.

42:38.468 --> 42:41.863
Laughing, knowing
that soon, he would
sup with the gods.

42:44.649 --> 42:50.002
But he urged his sons,
and he urged you,
his people, to avenge him.

42:50.176 --> 42:53.614
Since his death,
the Christian plague
has spread across the world,

42:53.788 --> 42:55.398
even infecting
our Rus brothers.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.531
But you still claim
to be Vikings.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.054
Then act like Vikings!

42:59.228 --> 43:01.927
Forget about
your comfortable existence.

43:02.101 --> 43:04.582
Come with me
and conquer King Alfred!

43:04.756 --> 43:07.585
Come with me
and conquer England,
and all of its riches!

43:08.542 --> 43:10.152
Reclaim your birthright.

43:10.326 --> 43:13.112
Be like the gods
and reach for Valhalla!

43:13.286 --> 43:14.766
[all] Valhalla!

43:14.940 --> 43:16.376
Valhalla!

43:19.684 --> 43:22.425
[all] Hail Ivar!
All hail Ivar!

43:22.600 --> 43:25.080
Hail Ivar! Hail Ivar!

43:25.254 --> 43:30.259
[all chanting]
Hail Ivar! Hail Ivar!

43:42.445 --> 43:44.709
[music playing]
