[Ivar] Why is that
one-eyed idiot
staring at me all the time?

03:41.612 --> 03:43.266
He's been on the road
with us for weeks.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.225
I don't like it.

03:47.662 --> 03:51.013
Tell one of our boys
to find a quiet spot
and get rid of him.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.321
[Vigrid]
They're just mercenaries.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.498
I wouldn't trust them
to do anything.

04:00.196 --> 04:01.589
Well, then,
maybe you should do it.

-People of Kattegat...
-[men hoot]

04:32.184 --> 04:34.317
I told you that
when I became King,

04:34.361 --> 04:36.450
my rule would be
very different
from that of Ivar's.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.929
And I mean to keep that pledge.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.280
[cheering]

04:40.323 --> 04:42.847
Ivar built a wall
around our town.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.936
He discouraged foreigners,
outlawed free speech

04:44.980 --> 04:46.808
and dissent
amongst our own people.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.505
[men chattering]

04:48.549 --> 04:51.334
Kattegat can only survive
and grow prosperous
through trade,

That is my belief.

[indistinct chattering]

05:21.669 --> 05:23.061
[Hvitserk] I know
who they are.

05:27.675 --> 05:31.200
All of these men collaborated
willingly with Ivar's regime.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.205
They served as his bodyguards.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.686
They did his bidding,
whatever that was.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.252
However cruel,
however depraved.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.212
They did it
without compunction,

05:43.255 --> 05:45.780
without a thought
even for their own families.

05:48.043 --> 05:51.394
They burned alive those
who were brave enough
to stand against them.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.091
And they burned alive
a young woman

05:54.441 --> 05:55.311
called Thora,

05:56.356 --> 05:57.269
who I loved.

05:58.575 --> 05:59.794
Didn't you?

[chuckles softly]

[grunts]

06:09.499 --> 06:10.761

06:10.805 --> 06:12.981
[all] Yes! They are!

06:13.024 --> 06:13.982
And what should I do
with them, huh?

06:14.025 --> 06:16.898

[cheering]

[pounding]

06:54.936 --> 06:56.894
These men are all guilty.

06:56.938 --> 07:00.028
They committed crimes
against their own people,
against you.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.246
[all] Yeah!

07:02.683 --> 07:04.336
And I know you all think
they deserve to die.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.512
[all] Yeah!

07:07.296 --> 07:09.429
But there's something
far worse than death,
far worse.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.214
I will banish them for life.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.740
They will become outlaws,
Skogarmaors,

07:16.784 --> 07:18.612
men of the forests,

07:18.655 --> 07:20.265
forever condemned to live
in the forest

07:20.309 --> 07:22.746
and other deserted places.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.401
Their property
will be confiscated.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.272
They will be branded
as Skogarmaors,

07:27.316 --> 07:29.231
and they can be killed
with impunity.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.362
This is much worse than death.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.541
They will live
not as human beings,
but as ghosts.

07:34.584 --> 07:37.152
Outside of human society.

07:37.195 --> 07:40.721
Everyday forced to regret
and remember their decisions

07:40.764 --> 07:42.113
and their crimes,

07:44.420 --> 07:45.856
yet unable to atone for them.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.730
Such is my decision.
All in favor, say "Aye."

07:49.773 --> 07:50.948
[all] Aye!

07:50.992 --> 07:52.428

You made the right decision.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.364
I hope so.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.105
Ivar would never have
set them free.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.413

10:34.503 --> 10:35.417
He is a Viking.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.549
His name is Ivar.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.769
One night he got drunk

10:39.813 --> 10:41.597
and told everyone
that he was a King.

[Ganbaatar speaking Rus]

10:46.428 --> 10:48.430
He doesn't look like a King,

To their capital,

11:30.472 --> 11:31.995

11:33.257 --> 11:34.389
Who is their ruler?

My Prince,

13:19.537 --> 13:20.843
we have made
an interesting arrest.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.979
A King - or so he claims -

13:26.022 --> 13:27.807
traveling along the Silk Road.

13:30.331 --> 13:31.245
A King?

[Ivar grunts]

13:33.116 --> 13:34.074
[Oleg speaking]

13:34.117 --> 13:34.683
From where?

13:36.032 --> 13:37.642
From Norway.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.346
A Viking.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.304
[speaking in Old Norse]

13:47.348 --> 13:49.567
You cannot walk.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.093
Are you wounded?

[continues speaking

13:54.007 --> 13:55.051
No,

13:56.226 --> 13:59.621
I'm a cripple.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.102
From birth.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.542
You speak my language!

14:10.153 --> 14:14.549
It was once the language
of my people too.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.552
We are Rus Vikings.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.772
[in English]
What did they call you?

14:22.818 --> 14:24.254
[in English]
My name is Ivar.

14:26.822 --> 14:27.867
They call me

14:28.432 --> 14:29.781
Ivar, the Boneless.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.481
I've heard of you.

14:36.614 --> 14:37.441
Ivar.

14:39.574 --> 14:40.792
The Boneless.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.842
Your fame has traveled
along the Silk Road.

14:49.845 --> 14:53.849
Like, honey,
beeswax, furs and slaves.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.462
But why do you travel
along it now?

14:59.550 --> 15:01.030
Without announcing yourself?

15:02.162 --> 15:04.120
Like a thief, hmm?

15:06.209 --> 15:09.517
I lost my kingdom
to my brothers.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.782
I am nothing.

15:13.825 --> 15:17.829
And I have nothing
to offer you, Prince Oleg.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.528
It was not my intention
to trouble you
with my presence.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.314
And where were you going?

15:24.967 --> 15:26.273
Nowhere.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.797
I have no plans.

15:28.840 --> 15:33.497
I am simply fleeing
the retribution
of my brothers.

15:37.023 --> 15:37.937
Well...

15:40.243 --> 15:41.331
You're here now.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.775
Who knows if your presence
will trouble me.

15:58.479 --> 15:59.610
Let us see.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.835
[grunting]

16:06.878 --> 16:09.533
[Bjorn] We have embarked
on a new way of life here.

16:09.577 --> 16:12.362
And that was always
my commitment as King.

16:12.406 --> 16:15.017
To build the most successful
trading station
in all of Scandinavia.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.499
But I will need
your continued support.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.848
I need my family.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.416
Mother?

16:24.070 --> 16:27.290
I wish you well
in your enterprise,
my dear son.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.990
And I'm sure you will succeed.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.818
But in the future,
you'll have to do it
without me.

16:35.907 --> 16:36.996
I don't understand.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.433
Why won't you stay?

16:40.782 --> 16:43.698
[Lagertha] I've seen
enough of war.

16:43.741 --> 16:46.005
I have seen enough of death.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.096
I have lost so many.

16:52.185 --> 16:55.231
I don't want to be a...
A public person anymore.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.364
I don't want to be responsible.

17:03.892 --> 17:08.375
I desire to live
a totally different
kind of life.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.031
How can you do that?

17:13.815 --> 17:16.600
I plan to build a farmstead.

17:16.644 --> 17:19.995
Just like the one
Ragnar and I lived in
when we were first married,

17:20.039 --> 17:22.824
where we were all so happy.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.830
I plan to build it
in the countryside.

17:28.873 --> 17:33.487
Untroubled by the problems
of running a large
and prosperous town.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.142
[Ubbe] Let me get this right.

17:36.185 --> 17:39.319
You want to retire
and disappear.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.843
The most famous shield maiden
in all of Scandinavia?

17:41.886 --> 17:44.889
-[Torvi] In the world.
-In the world.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.414
Will in the future
you become a simple farmer,

17:47.457 --> 17:49.068
just a forgotten
and private person?

17:49.851 --> 17:50.721
[Lagertha] Yes.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.637
That is what I want, Ubbe.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.032
I no longer wish to be famous.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.777
You must forgive me, Bjorn,
but my mind is made up.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.955
Then I must accept it.

18:10.741 --> 18:14.789
Shall I count on you...?

18:16.007 --> 18:18.314
Practice just like our father.

18:18.358 --> 18:21.143
I feel the compulsion
and the need to go
exploring again.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.494
...can understand that.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.324
I was once told about land,
fat to the west.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.631
A wonderer had glimpsed
it from his book,

18:30.674 --> 18:32.372
it's an uninhabited land.

18:32.415 --> 18:35.723
Thickly forested,
trees as high as mountains.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.594
He could not reach it himself,

18:37.638 --> 18:40.031
but just the vision of it,
still haunts him to this day.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.122
I wanna find that land...

18:44.166 --> 18:45.994
If it really exists.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.694
Well, I can hardly stop you.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.783
Yet, I will miss you, brother.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.096
And what about you, Hvitserk?

19:01.140 --> 19:04.447
I'm sure you also have
some reason to leave.

19:04.491 --> 19:08.321
If it is my fate to kill Ivar,
then I must try to find him.

19:08.364 --> 19:11.585
Where'd you begin?
The world is such a big place.

19:11.628 --> 19:14.457
Surely, the gods will one day
show you the rock under
which he has crawled,

19:14.501 --> 19:17.068
and until then,
you can stay here with me.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.334
Probably better to stay
than to chase shadows, uh?

19:25.555 --> 19:29.124
Well, I guess it's true
what they say,
nothing lasts forever.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.477
Where ever we may go,

19:34.521 --> 19:36.871
may the gods continue to
love and protect us, yes?

19:36.914 --> 19:38.525
Skol.

19:38.568 --> 19:39.961
[all] Skol.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.795
[chattering]

19:57.500 --> 19:58.109
[grunting]

20:04.594 --> 20:06.248
[grunting]

20:37.366 --> 20:40.151
[speaking in Old Norse]

20:42.415 --> 20:44.504
[grunting]

20:45.374 --> 20:48.334
[speaking in Old Norse]

20:51.815 --> 20:54.992
Now, my friend,
is the time for truth.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.995
Tell us about this King Ivar.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.217
[dog barking]

21:04.741 --> 21:06.700
[Bjorn] Why are you so quiet
this evening?

21:06.743 --> 21:07.875
You hardly spoke.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.051
You spoke of family.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.532
But family isn't everything.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.231
In the end,

21:19.016 --> 21:20.931
we are born alone
and we die alone.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.500
[Bjorn] Yet we need our family.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.286
We need our loved ones.

21:29.679 --> 21:30.854
I need you, Gunnhild.

21:31.768 --> 21:32.856
[Gunnhild] I am here.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.076
I love you.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.425
I have told you so
and I am honest.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.123
More honest than you, I think.

21:39.167 --> 21:39.994
[Bjorn] Hmm.

21:43.954 --> 21:44.955
And tomorrow?

21:46.827 --> 21:48.307
Tomorrow,
I will still love you.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.701
I would walk into the fire
for you.

21:54.008 --> 21:56.793
But beyond that,
who knows.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.969
Though married, I am still free

21:59.013 --> 22:00.188
in my soul.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.107
Sometimes you are hard to love.

22:06.977 --> 22:07.978
No.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.372
I think I am very easy.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.549
Kiss me.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.637
No, you kiss me.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.605
You see?

22:25.648 --> 22:27.215
Nothing is so complicated.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.174
Only thinking makes it so.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.837
[groaning]

22:44.711 --> 22:46.626
Is it true

22:46.669 --> 22:50.673
that the cripple you were
accompanying is the famous
Ivar, the Boneless?

22:50.717 --> 22:52.109
Yes, Prince.

22:52.153 --> 22:54.634
-He lost a battle?
-To his brothers.

22:54.677 --> 22:58.333
Bjorn Ironside, Ubbe, Hvitserk.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.684
All of them,
sons of the famous
Ragnar Lothbrok.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.688
How can I believe
that he's a King?

23:07.342 --> 23:08.822
Where is the proof?

23:08.865 --> 23:09.866
You have none.

23:10.911 --> 23:11.999
You're lying.

23:13.348 --> 23:14.741
You think I'm a fool?

23:16.090 --> 23:17.178
Fatal mistake.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.922
He's not just a King!

23:24.011 --> 23:24.968
What?

23:26.230 --> 23:26.753
What did you say?

23:28.537 --> 23:31.671
I said Ivar,
he's not just a King.

23:34.848 --> 23:37.198
I... I don't understand.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.373
Then, what is he?

23:39.069 --> 23:40.027
He's a god!

23:41.550 --> 23:42.638
A god?

23:43.683 --> 23:46.599
[all laughing]

23:49.384 --> 23:50.690
A god?

23:50.733 --> 23:53.257
Yes. A true god!

23:53.301 --> 23:55.129
Revealed to the world
at Kattegat!

23:56.217 --> 23:58.045
We're Christians now.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.613
But we still have some strong
memories of the old gods.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.659
We still, perhaps,
some fear of them.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.750
So, if he's a god,

24:07.794 --> 24:10.753
why was he traveling through
my kingdom in disguise?

24:11.841 --> 24:13.364
What are his real intentions?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.237
I can't help being suspicious.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.369
I need to know.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.677
You can imagine my desire,
can't you?

24:22.939 --> 24:23.940
[grunts]

24:27.378 --> 24:30.643
Please, you had
better to tell me,

24:31.382 --> 24:33.341
my friend.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.344
There's nothing left to say!

24:37.127 --> 24:38.738
[panting]

24:53.187 --> 24:54.754
[horse neighing]

25:05.199 --> 25:07.506
[panting]

25:15.035 --> 25:15.818
[groaning]

25:18.908 --> 25:21.694
We have had some problems
with your friend.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.392
He was not cooperative,
not helpful.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.307
[groans]

25:28.483 --> 25:30.398
I don't understand.

25:30.441 --> 25:31.486
What has he done wrong?

25:33.053 --> 25:35.664
Your friend refused to tell us

25:35.708 --> 25:37.884
why you had really come here,

25:38.798 --> 25:40.626
to my kingdom,
in disguise.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.192
[groaning]

25:44.020 --> 25:47.458
I already told you
there was no reason.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.983
[laughs] There is always
a reason!

25:51.158 --> 25:52.028
Always.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.032
[breathing heavily]

25:56.076 --> 25:57.947
[groaning]

26:04.650 --> 26:05.738
[speaking in Old Norse]

26:05.781 --> 26:08.001
Hail god Ivar!

26:09.611 --> 26:10.743
[screams]

26:39.075 --> 26:40.033
Lagertha.

26:58.529 --> 26:59.443
Maybe.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.841
Let's take a look.

27:09.584 --> 27:11.847
[instrumental music playing]

27:37.525 --> 27:38.918
[inaudible]

27:54.977 --> 27:55.804
Hmm.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.809
[Lagertha]
You were right, Torvi.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.768
This is where
I shall build my farm.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.249
This is where I shall

28:06.293 --> 28:08.034
live out the rest
of my days.

28:09.339 --> 28:10.863
-We will help you to build it.
-Hmm.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.692
We will not sail anywhere

28:13.735 --> 28:15.694
until your new farm house
is built and you're settled.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.790
I would need some livestock.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.053
Not much, a few goats,

28:27.096 --> 28:30.317
a pig maybe,
a horse to pull the plow.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.754
[Hali] Are you really
going to live here, Lagertha?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.843
-Yes.
-[Asa] All on your own?

28:36.323 --> 28:37.585
Probably.

28:37.628 --> 28:38.891
Won't you be lonely?

28:40.022 --> 28:41.502
[Lagertha chuckles]

28:41.545 --> 28:44.853
No, Hali, I won't be lonely.

28:44.897 --> 28:49.902
Because I will be visited by
Grandfather Ragnar and
a lot of other friendly ghosts.

28:55.559 --> 28:56.560
I also have some news.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.955
You don't need to tell me.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.001
You are with child.

29:03.785 --> 29:04.786
Life goes on.

29:08.311 --> 29:09.356
Life goes on.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.012
[men chattering in Rus]

29:16.406 --> 29:17.973
[commands in Rus]

29:24.023 --> 29:25.589
[Oleg in English]
What do you think?

29:25.633 --> 29:28.636
Would you like to fly,
Ivar, the Boneless?

29:28.679 --> 29:31.595
-I don't understand.
-[chuckles] There is nothing
to understand.

29:31.639 --> 29:34.685
Once we get enough speed,
we will be free of the earth.

29:35.904 --> 29:37.776
Isn't that the dream
of all humans?

29:38.951 --> 29:40.996
-I don't know.
-[Oleg chuckles]

29:41.867 --> 29:43.782
Surely for you,
who cannot walk.

29:44.913 --> 29:47.611
Who can only crawl
across this earth.

29:47.655 --> 29:50.658
The thought of flying free
as a bird above it,

29:50.701 --> 29:52.442
must be exciting, huh?
[chuckles]

29:56.577 --> 29:58.274
[men chattering]

29:59.885 --> 30:03.062
Go!

30:06.456 --> 30:07.501
[screaming]

30:10.460 --> 30:12.462
[man] Let go.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.377
Don't be scared!

30:14.421 --> 30:16.249
You won't die if I'm with you!

30:17.032 --> 30:19.165
-Go!
-No, no, no. No!

30:20.993 --> 30:22.733
[Ivar] No, no, no!

30:22.777 --> 30:24.692
[Oleg screams] Let go!

30:24.735 --> 30:26.694
-Let go!
-No!

30:26.737 --> 30:28.609
[both screaming]

30:32.439 --> 30:33.396
[all cheering]

30:35.485 --> 30:37.139
[Oleg laughing]

30:39.533 --> 30:40.664
-[Ivar gasping]
-Whoo!

30:46.496 --> 30:48.455
I wanted to bring you up here.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.197
-[exhales deeply]
-Why?

30:52.241 --> 30:53.852
Because you're a god.

30:54.722 --> 30:55.854
It's true, isn't it?

30:56.942 --> 31:00.771
You are a direct
descendant of Odin.

31:00.815 --> 31:03.339
[laughs] You have been
revealed as a god.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.603
Aah!

31:06.647 --> 31:09.345
The gods travel across the sky!

31:10.129 --> 31:11.434
Don't they?

31:21.270 --> 31:23.142
-[flaps]
-[both scream]

31:24.404 --> 31:26.188
[Oleg gasping]

31:27.973 --> 31:30.149
You won't die
if you're with me.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.802
You're not a god!

31:33.979 --> 31:38.244
If I cut your ropes,
you would fall to the ground
and die. Isn't that true?

31:38.287 --> 31:41.160
-[Oleg screaming]
-Do you believe? Huh?

31:41.203 --> 31:43.075
-[screaming]
-[laughing]

31:43.466 --> 31:44.467
Aah!

31:46.730 --> 31:48.689
[Oleg screaming]

31:48.732 --> 31:50.212
-No!
-[screaming]

31:52.432 --> 31:54.173
[chattering]

31:57.698 --> 32:00.353
[both screaming]

32:03.791 --> 32:05.140
[both laughing]

32:08.361 --> 32:10.754
-[gasping]
-Now do you believe?

32:11.712 --> 32:15.281
[both scream and laugh]

32:45.964 --> 32:47.095
[dramatic music playing]

32:58.324 --> 33:01.022
King Bjorn, Queen Gunnhild,

33:01.066 --> 33:02.241
we bring news of King Harald.

33:06.201 --> 33:09.465
We were led to believe that
King Harald had died
of his wounds.

33:09.509 --> 33:12.251
No. It's true he was wounded
in the battle,

33:12.294 --> 33:14.775
but King Olaf rescued him
and took him back home.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.996
Well, that was indeed noble
of King Olaf.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.260
[messenger 1]
Perhaps not so much.

33:21.303 --> 33:24.045
While King Harald was sick,
King Olaf claimed his kingdom.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.526
And had enough warriors
to enforce his claim.

33:29.659 --> 33:30.834
[Bjorn] Well, that is a pity.

33:32.314 --> 33:35.100
What has it got to do with me?

33:35.143 --> 33:36.927
[messenger 2] King Harald
is still recovering his health,

33:36.971 --> 33:40.322
but he does not want
to be ruled by King Olaf.

33:40.366 --> 33:44.065
He knows his life is threatened
and likely to be forfeit.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.676
He also remembers that
he came willingly to your aid

33:46.720 --> 33:49.679
when you desired to attack
your brother Ivar.

33:49.723 --> 33:52.291
And that he personally
saved you

33:52.334 --> 33:54.336
when Ivar tried to capture
and kill you.

33:55.729 --> 33:56.904
Therefore, he claims
an obligation.

33:58.514 --> 34:00.081
He asks you

34:00.125 --> 34:01.778
as a true Viking,

34:01.822 --> 34:05.260
as a son of Ragnar,
as a friend and ally,
to help him

34:05.304 --> 34:06.827
overthrow the usurper.

34:09.351 --> 34:13.094
[Gunnhild] I'm sure
we are very sorry
for King Harald's plight.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.792
But I am not sure
we are under
any obligation to him.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.403
On the contrary,

34:17.446 --> 34:19.840
King Harald believes
that you have become
true friends.

34:19.883 --> 34:23.278
Whatever's happened between
you in the past.

34:23.322 --> 34:26.107
He could've pressed his claim
to the kingship of all Norway
when he had the power.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.371
And he could've pressed
his claim to marry you,

34:29.415 --> 34:30.807
Queen Gunnhild.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.252
As a man of honor,
he did neither.

34:41.383 --> 34:43.081
But now, King Bjorn,

34:44.343 --> 34:45.605
he reaches out to you

34:46.867 --> 34:47.781
as another man...

34:49.609 --> 34:52.133
Man of honor for your help.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.789
We heard that you had become
King of Kattegat.

34:57.443 --> 35:00.141
So the real question is,

35:02.100 --> 35:05.059
what kind of a King
are you going to be?

35:09.977 --> 35:10.760
[chuckles]

35:12.110 --> 35:13.067
I will think on it.

35:28.996 --> 35:30.302
[Oleg] I have something
to show you.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.006
[Ivar] What is this place?

35:41.008 --> 35:42.662
[Oleg] A mausoleum
of my dead wife.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.014
The most sacred place
in the palace.

35:49.669 --> 35:52.150
And the most sacred place
in my heart.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.156
How did she die?

36:02.290 --> 36:03.378
I killed her.

36:05.554 --> 36:07.948
She was young and foolish.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.777
I discovered that
she was sleeping with
one of my aides.

36:14.389 --> 36:15.651
I loved her.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.264
She was enchanting.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.097
I thought of her all the time.

36:33.626 --> 36:34.714
[sniffles]

36:36.455 --> 36:37.934
Even on the battlefield.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.111
Yet,

36:42.635 --> 36:44.071
all that time,

36:47.030 --> 36:48.945
in some sordid room
here in the palace,

36:50.556 --> 36:52.688
she was secretly betraying me.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.000
I know your pain.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.318
Then you know all about
the fickleness of women.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.977
I somehow knew
you would understand.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.418
I don't bring many people
down here.

37:31.205 --> 37:32.250
But you...

37:36.602 --> 37:37.907
I think you and I

37:39.300 --> 37:41.868
are going to have
a very special relationship.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.091
I truly think so.

38:16.555 --> 38:17.991
[instrumental music playing]

38:20.123 --> 38:20.907
[grunts]

38:41.275 --> 38:42.842
[grunting]

39:21.489 --> 39:22.925
As the sun sets,

39:25.667 --> 39:27.756
and in the sight of the gods,

39:27.800 --> 39:31.369
I swear, I will fight no more.

39:32.718 --> 39:33.936
Forever.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.012
[chattering]

40:08.667 --> 40:10.669
Those messengers
disturbed me today.

40:11.931 --> 40:12.758
I know.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.152
I did not expect it.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.594
It was when they asked me
what kind of King
I was expected to be,

40:25.727 --> 40:27.120
I thought I'd answered that.

40:29.122 --> 40:29.949
I thought I knew.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.954
When I spoke to the people,
I spoke from the heart.

40:38.392 --> 40:40.046
I thought it was my answer.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.135
I'm sure it was your answer.

40:43.789 --> 40:46.052
Those messengers,
those unknown men,

40:47.140 --> 40:49.751
they spoke to something deeper.

40:49.795 --> 40:53.755
I'm sure they did not know it,
and King Harald secretly
commissioned them.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.017
I know that, but still...

40:55.757 --> 40:57.846
You are confusing things.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.718
Whether or not you go
to the aid of King Harald

40:59.761 --> 41:01.502
will not define
what you are as a King.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.939
Then what will define it?

41:03.983 --> 41:05.680
Perhaps your differences
from your father.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.162
Or my similarity.

41:11.164 --> 41:12.600
He was still loved.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.475
You must be yourself.

41:19.302 --> 41:22.001
I want to be myself,
I'm just not sure how to be.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.051
After all,
doing the right thing
might just be the easy way.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.925
That is always the danger,

41:32.968 --> 41:35.057
to do the right things
for the wrong reasons.

41:37.886 --> 41:39.540
You are so right
to be cautious.

41:50.725 --> 41:52.118
When I look out
into the Great Hall,

41:54.163 --> 41:56.470
I see my father and my mother.

41:56.514 --> 41:57.340
Why wouldn't I?

42:03.433 --> 42:04.957
And suddenly, I feel old.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.266
I'm not their son any longer.

42:12.965 --> 42:14.227
I'm your husband.

42:16.403 --> 42:17.273
A father.

42:21.234 --> 42:22.278
And I am a King.

42:32.898 --> 42:34.029
[sniffing]

42:37.076 --> 42:39.382
I have decided to treat
your arrival here

42:40.514 --> 42:42.385
as a sign,

42:42.429 --> 42:43.386
an omen.

42:47.086 --> 42:49.828
You see,
for a long time, we Rus,

42:49.871 --> 42:52.221
guided by my brother-in-law
King Rurik,

42:52.265 --> 42:55.877
looked to the east
for trade, conquests,
and expansion.

42:57.836 --> 42:59.533
Yet, even before your,

43:01.056 --> 43:03.493
I admit,
somewhat unexpected appearance,

43:05.060 --> 43:07.280
I had begun to question
this way of thinking.

43:09.282 --> 43:10.805
Perhaps, after all,

43:12.415 --> 43:14.809
it's time for us to look west

43:15.418 --> 43:17.986
again.

43:18.030 --> 43:22.991
Years ago, I hung my shield
on the city gates
of Constantinople,

43:23.035 --> 43:28.214
but now it's time to hang it
on the gates of Kattegat.

43:30.346 --> 43:32.522
Our ancestral
and original home.

43:34.655 --> 43:35.961
And you can help me.

43:37.310 --> 43:39.225
And be revenged

43:39.268 --> 43:41.793
upon your brothers
at the same time.

43:49.017 --> 43:50.584
I say it is a fine plan.

43:52.978 --> 43:56.111
Now I see that my arrival
here in Kiev was no accident,

43:56.155 --> 43:58.505
as I supposed,
but all arranged by the gods.

44:00.681 --> 44:02.509
How could it be otherwise?

44:03.815 --> 44:04.816
The gods.

44:05.904 --> 44:07.383
Let us drink to

44:08.689 --> 44:09.385
Odin.

44:10.038 --> 44:11.126
[chuckles]

44:11.866 --> 44:13.607
To Odin.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.390
[goblets clink]

44:18.046 --> 44:19.613
[dramatic music playing]

44:22.877 --> 44:24.879
[music playing]
