<i>(very quietly)</i>
Who'll pinch me to wake me up?

02:26.779 --> 02:29.543
Who will laugh at me when l fall?

02:33.419 --> 02:36.013
Whose breath will l listen for...

02:38.791 --> 02:41.817
...so that l may sleep?

02:42.662 --> 02:45.187
Whose hand will l hold...

02:47.667 --> 02:50.192
...so that l may walk?

03:05.151 --> 03:12.580
<i>(man) We may question ourselves</i>
<i>at moments such as these.</i>

03:14.294 --> 03:16.990
<i>Did we make the right decision</i>
<i>to settle here?</i>

03:27.807 --> 03:31.208
We are grateful for the time
we have been given.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.123
<i>(murmuring)</i>

03:49.062 --> 03:50.893

<i>(moaning)</i>

05:57.423 --> 05:59.254
<i>(rumbling)</i>

06:19.045 --> 06:22.606
What manner of spectacle has attracted
your attention so splendidly?

06:22.682 --> 06:26.880
l ought to carry it in my pocket
to help me teach.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.312
<i>(flies buzzing)</i>

06:34.994 --> 06:37.326
Who came upon this?

06:41.033 --> 06:44.434
- Philip, did you move this?
- No, Mr. Walker.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.495
<i>(flies buzzing)</i>

06:52.979 --> 06:57.040
l inspected it carefully. lts head was
twisted back and much of its fur removed.

06:57.116 --> 07:00.483
- l see.
- lt was murdered.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.885
But who is the culprit?

07:02.955 --> 07:06.516
Who has done this heinous act?

07:06.592 --> 07:10.995
- Those We Don't Speak Of killed it.
- There it is.

07:11.063 --> 07:14.829
Why would such a notion
come into your mind?

07:16.202 --> 07:18.227
- They're meat eaters.
- Mmm.

07:18.304 --> 07:21.330
They have large claws.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.398
Children...

07:23.476 --> 07:29.346
...Those We Don't Speak Of have not
breached our borders for many years.

07:30.416 --> 07:33.544
We do not go into their woods,

07:33.619 --> 07:36.850
they do not come into our valley.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.914
lt is a truce.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.482
We do not threaten them.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.552
Why would they do this?

07:43.629 --> 07:48.657
And we ought not to overlook
the Flight of the Birds.

07:48.734 --> 07:53.171
We didn't have it last year
and l, for one, missed it desperately.

07:54.574 --> 07:59.409
And l know your wife missed
the children dressed in feathers and such.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.970
- l am fond of it.
- Mmm.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.447
l do not have a say in this matter.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.146
August Nicholson is chair
of today's meeting.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.587
<i>(door opens)</i>

08:10.656 --> 08:15.593
There's a young man who has
requested a word with the elders.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.152
Well, do have him come forward.

08:20.099 --> 08:21.930
Alice.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.838
<i>(August)</i> Hello, Lucius.

08:33.044 --> 08:37.004
''My mother is unaware
of the reason for my visit today.''

08:37.082 --> 08:42.520
''She did not give her consent
or consult me in any form.''

08:45.224 --> 08:49.251
''The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness,

08:49.328 --> 08:52.195
and other events,
have weighed on my thoughts.''

08:53.032 --> 08:56.490
''l ask permission to cross
into the forbidden woods

08:56.569 --> 08:58.696
and travel to the nearest town.''

08:58.771 --> 09:02.935
''l will gather new medicines,
and l will return.''

09:03.009 --> 09:05.739
''With regards to
Those We Don't Speak Of,

09:05.811 --> 09:08.473
l am certain they will let me pass.''

09:08.548 --> 09:13.178
''Creatures can sense emotion and fear.''

09:13.252 --> 09:16.949
''They will see l am pure of intention,
and not afraid.''

09:17.023 --> 09:19.014
''The end.''

09:26.566 --> 09:29.433
<i>(Alice) What goes on</i>
<i>in that head of yours?</i>

09:31.971 --> 09:34.269
Say something, Lucius.

09:37.710 --> 09:42.511
Finton Coin is in the tower,
and l've promised to sit with him.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.573
Hmm.

09:46.953 --> 09:50.184
Do you ever think of the towns, Finton?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.724
The towns?

09:52.792 --> 09:55.454
What for?

09:55.528 --> 09:59.828
They're wicked places
where wicked people live. That's all.

10:05.071 --> 10:08.370
Thank you, Lucius.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.602
You're a good friend.

10:14.580 --> 10:18.016
l do hope no one saw you.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.915
<i>(howling)</i>

10:32.031 --> 10:34.022
<i>(flies buzzing)</i>

10:40.640 --> 10:46.010
What we seem to have amongst us
is a predator of some type,

10:46.078 --> 10:50.242
most likely a coyote or a wolf.

10:52.151 --> 10:56.485
lts manner of... of killing
and removing the fur,

10:56.555 --> 10:59.888
but leaving the flesh torn,

10:59.959 --> 11:04.157
may be a sign that this animal
suffers from madness.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.197
And for the next fortnight,
we should be vigilant

11:08.267 --> 11:10.701
for sightings of this coyote.

11:10.770 --> 11:15.264
Keep careful watch over
our little ones as they play on the hills.

11:19.311 --> 11:22.542
As for the other notion...

11:22.615 --> 11:26.984
...we do not believe
our boundary has been breached.

11:27.053 --> 11:33.617
Those We Don't Speak Of are much
larger creatures than coyotes...

11:34.593 --> 11:38.120
...and we would know
if they had been here.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.428
<i>(murmuring)</i>

11:41.500 --> 11:43.627
<i>(door opens)</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:46.968
Ahh, it's frightful, this business
with the coyote. ls it not, Papa?

11:47.039 --> 11:50.099
- Do not feel worried, Kitty.
- You are not troubled?

11:50.176 --> 11:52.576
l'm certain it will all end soon.

11:52.645 --> 11:57.412
- Can we speak on other matters, then?
- lt would be a relief.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.542
l'm in love!

11:59.618 --> 12:03.281
l want your permission
to marry, Papa.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.823
There's a proper manner in which
things are supposed to happen.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.485
Such as the boy would normally be
standing next to you,

12:08.561 --> 12:11.086
in a moment such as this...
Where is the boy in all this, Kitty?

12:11.163 --> 12:13.654
l haven't spoken to him as of yet.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.499
The young man is unaware
of your intentions?

12:17.570 --> 12:22.337
He has a quiet way. l was going to talk with
him, Papa, but not without your blessings.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.603
l won't talk with him without your blessings.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.076
Kitty!

12:26.145 --> 12:28.409
lt's Lucius Hunt.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.441
Lucius?

12:32.518 --> 12:35.578
You think badly of him?

12:35.654 --> 12:39.351
- No, no. l have been thinking about him.
- He's not like the other boys, Papa.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.484
He doesn't joke or bounce about.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.790
No, he certainly does not.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.163
Do l have your blessings, then?

12:50.469 --> 12:52.460
<i>(sighs)</i>

12:54.907 --> 12:57.307
Look, do me one favor first.

12:57.376 --> 13:03.838
Do not tell anyone else of your burstings
until you have spoken with the young man.

13:09.555 --> 13:12.581
Good afternoon, Lucius.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.723
l wanted to... to... to tell you something.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.967
l love you, Lucius.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.837
l love you... like the day is long.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.504
l love you more than
the sun and the moon together.

13:33.579 --> 13:38.175
And if you feel the same way,
then we should not hide it any longer.

13:38.250 --> 13:42.084
lt's a gift, love is.
We should be thankful.

13:42.154 --> 13:46.386
We should bellow it out
with all the breath in our lungs.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.325
Thank you! Thank you!

13:49.395 --> 13:51.795
Thank you!

13:54.567 --> 13:57.434
<i>(screaming and sobbing)</i>

13:57.503 --> 14:00.267
Shh, shh.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.604
Shh.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.304
<i>(sobbing)</i>

14:06.378 --> 14:11.645
? Baby, sleep, gently sleep

14:11.717 --> 14:17.314
? Life is long and love is deep

14:17.389 --> 14:22.952
? Time will be sweet for thee

14:23.028 --> 14:26.555
? All the world to see

14:26.632 --> 14:30.966
? Time to look about and know

14:31.036 --> 14:35.029
? How the shadows come and go

14:35.107 --> 14:41.012
? How the breeze stirs the trees

14:41.080 --> 14:45.414
? How the blossoms grow

14:56.495 --> 15:02.024
l often wondered if you and my son bonded
because neither of you is fond of speaking.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.160
You're very kind.

15:04.236 --> 15:08.229
You must pardon my manners.
l haven't slept in many nights.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.315
<i>(man)</i> You are doing capital,
Jamison.

15:19.385 --> 15:23.185
Just a few more moments, huh?
Gather your bravery.

15:23.255 --> 15:27.555
Do not jostle about so. You'll ruin my shirt.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.856
<i>(whimpering)</i>

15:29.929 --> 15:31.920
<i>(howling)</i>

15:33.032 --> 15:37.901
They made a sound when l made a sound,
and they mimic before they attack.

15:37.970 --> 15:41.599
Have courage, man.
That's a wives' tale. lt isn't true.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.370
Do not falter. Steel yourself!

15:49.348 --> 15:52.476
<i>(August) You know,</i>
<i>like a dog can smell you.</i>

15:52.551 --> 15:55.611
- Pardon me, Mr. Nicholson?
- Hmm.

15:59.191 --> 16:03.059
You may run from sorrow, as we have.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.790
Sorrow will find you.

16:08.434 --> 16:11.164
lt can smell you.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.050
<i>(rustling)</i>

16:30.990 --> 16:33.151
<i>(breathing heavily)</i>

16:52.344 --> 16:54.335
Hurry.

17:01.053 --> 17:04.181
l didn't know you could run so fast.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.986
We're still for running and staying... Hey!

17:08.794 --> 17:13.992
<i>(Kitty) Noah ought to be punished. He</i>
<i>whacked little Joseph with a stick again.</i>

17:14.066 --> 17:16.057
<i>(crowd groans)</i>

17:16.135 --> 17:18.569
- Ouch!
- <i>(girl)</i> No more hitting! Put it down!

Ow, ow, ow!

17:20.939 --> 17:22.906
<i>(girl #2)</i> Why don't they grab it?

<i>(distant shouting)</i>

17:34.053 --> 17:36.248
<i>(woman)</i> Noah Percy!

17:37.256 --> 17:39.952
Stop your fussing right this moment.

17:40.025 --> 17:42.960
<i>(murmuring and laughing)</i>

17:52.638 --> 17:54.799
You're in trouble, you know.

17:54.873 --> 17:59.037
- No hitting, no hitting.
- l'm to place you in the quiet room.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.875
Um, l'll cry quarts.

18:01.947 --> 18:06.407
- What if we strike a deal?
- Yeah, capital idea.

18:06.485 --> 18:10.251
lt would be prudent to keep our deal
a secret. Can you do that?

18:10.322 --> 18:13.485
Can l keep a secret?
Like a church mouse.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.956
You needn't go to the quiet room
if you a take an oath

18:18.030 --> 18:21.363
to never strike any person again.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.663
- No hitting, no hitting.
- No. No hitting.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.136
- No hitting.
- No hitting.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.197
No hitting.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.341
The deal is struck.

18:39.151 --> 18:40.618
<i>(sighs)</i>

18:40.686 --> 18:42.984
We ought not return right away, huh?

18:43.055 --> 18:47.014
What shall we do
with our stolen time?

18:47.092 --> 18:48.753
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

18:48.827 --> 18:51.728
- Hmm. Shall we have a foot race?
- Yes.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.322
- Up the hill to the resting rock?
- No cheating.

18:54.399 --> 18:57.368
What a deeply scandalous thing to say.
l insist you take that back.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.768
ls that the school bell?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.135
<i>(shouting)</i>

19:07.212 --> 19:09.578

<i>(giggling)</i>

19:18.023 --> 19:20.014
Whoo!

19:39.545 --> 19:42.571
My sister cried a lot.

19:44.049 --> 19:47.348
You wonder how l recognized you?

19:47.419 --> 19:52.686
Some people - just a handful,
mind you - give off the tiniest color.

19:52.758 --> 19:56.057
lt's faint, like a haze.

19:56.128 --> 20:00.656
lt's the only thing
l ever see in the darkness.

20:00.732 --> 20:03.064
Papa has it, too.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.503
Do you wonder what your color is?

20:07.573 --> 20:10.371
Well, that l won't tell you.
lt's not ladylike to speak of such things.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.637
You shouldn't even have asked.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.872
<i>(bird flying overhead)</i>

You run like a boy.

20:24.323 --> 20:26.484
Thank you.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.795
l know why you denied my sister.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.464
When l was younger...

20:38.537 --> 20:42.200
...you used to hold my arm
when l walked.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.533
Then suddenly, you stopped.

20:46.612 --> 20:50.480
One day, l even tripped
in your presence, and nearly fell.

20:50.549 --> 20:55.350
l was faking, of course,
but still, you did not hold me.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.250
Sometimes we don't do
things we want to do

20:59.324 --> 21:02.953
so that others won't know
we want to do them.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.329
- What?
- <i>(frog croaks)</i>

21:15.407 --> 21:17.637
<i>(yelps and laughs)</i>

21:25.984 --> 21:29.351

21:29.421 --> 21:31.753
What a splendid present.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.814
<i>(Lucius)</i> Be cautious.

21:33.892 --> 21:36.224
You are holding the bad color.

21:42.968 --> 21:47.302
This color attracts Those We Don't
Speak Of. You must bury it.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.974
You ought not to pick
that color berry any more.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.708
He picked it from his pocket.

21:58.283 --> 22:01.912
What's wrong?
Your breathing has changed.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.751
<i>(Lucius)</i> l've never set eyes
on these before.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.589
You did not pick that now.
Where did you find this?

''Today at Resting Rock,

22:17.102 --> 22:21.630
Noah Percy handed lvy Walker berries

22:21.707 --> 22:23.937
''When asked where
he found these berries,

''<i>It is my belief that Noah Percy</i>

''<i>It is also my belief that,</i>
<i>because of his innocence,</i>

22:41.860 --> 22:45.455
<i>those creatures who reside</i>
<i>in the woods did not harm him.</i> ''

22:45.530 --> 22:48.966
''This strengthens my feeling
that they will let me pass

22:49.034 --> 22:52.003
if they sense l am not a threat.''

22:52.904 --> 22:56.533
<i>(Alice) We shall speak of the town,</i>
<i>just this once,</i>

22:56.608 --> 22:59.702
<i>and we shall never speak of it again.</i>

23:03.281 --> 23:08.014
Your father left for the market
on a Tuesday,

23:08.086 --> 23:11.112
at a quarter past nine in the morning.

23:14.493 --> 23:20.489
He was found robbed and naked
in the filthy river, two days later.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.699
Why'd you tell me this blackness?

23:29.775 --> 23:33.074
So you will know the nature
of what you desire.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.905
l do not desire it.
My intentions are true to my word.

23:37.983 --> 23:40.451
l think of nothing
but the people of this village.

23:40.519 --> 23:45.752
Forgive me.
l am but scared for my only son's life.

23:45.824 --> 23:49.157
l am not the one with secrets.

23:51.530 --> 23:53.589
What is your meaning?

23:55.267 --> 23:58.668
There are secrets
in every corner of this village.

23:59.671 --> 24:04.005
Do you not feel it? Do you not see it?

24:04.976 --> 24:06.568
That is for my own well-being,

24:06.645 --> 24:10.741
so the evil things from my past
are kept close and not forgotten.

24:10.816 --> 24:13.410
Forgetting would be to let them
be born again in another form.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.476
Then let us open it.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.954
No!

24:18.023 --> 24:20.787
Perhaps we should speak
with Edward Walker together.

24:20.859 --> 24:24.226
- He may be able...
- He hides, too.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.787
He hides his feelings for you.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.531
Oh.

24:38.176 --> 24:40.303
Sometimes we don't do things,

24:40.378 --> 24:44.314
yet others know we want to do things,
so we don't do them.

24:48.854 --> 24:51.687
What nonsense are you saying?

24:56.061 --> 24:59.394
You needn't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

25:03.535 --> 25:06.732
You remind me of a colt sometimes.

25:14.112 --> 25:17.343
What makes you think
he has feelings for me?

25:21.586 --> 25:23.918
He never touches you.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.789
<i>(growling)</i>

27:12.831 --> 27:14.662
<i>(rustling)</i>

27:32.917 --> 27:34.748
<i>(growling)</i>

27:39.024 --> 27:41.549
There's no escape!

27:43.828 --> 27:46.797
Oh, hello.

27:46.865 --> 27:49.333
l was just playing a game with Noah.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.495
The rascal must have gone
to hide in my house again.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.629
<i>(loudly)</i> Houses are against the rules!

27:54.706 --> 27:57.038
<i>(whispering)</i> He knows that.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.010
Are you all right?

28:04.382 --> 28:10.048
We're tending to the children tonight,
Kitty and l. l should be with her. Be well.

28:15.927 --> 28:19.260
l heard my parents speaking of you.

28:19.330 --> 28:23.630
l know of your request to go to the towns.

28:23.702 --> 28:27.968
l think it is noble,
but l do not think it is right.

28:28.039 --> 28:31.873
<i>(Lucius)</i> Are you not angry
you have no sight?

28:31.943 --> 28:35.970
<i>(whispers)</i> l see the world, Lucius Hunt.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.379
Just not as you see it.

28:46.057 --> 28:49.151
What of Noah, then?

28:49.227 --> 28:53.960
What if there are medicines for Noah
that could help him be still and to learn?

28:54.032 --> 28:58.366
May we stop speaking of this?
lt is putting knots in my stomach.

29:03.441 --> 29:06.604
Kitty is to be married.

29:07.612 --> 29:13.312
She's found love, again,
with Christop Crane.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.944
You think it an odd choice, right?

29:16.020 --> 29:21.890
You know, he won't sit back in his chair
for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.657
But he does have
a gentlemanly way about him...

29:25.730 --> 29:29.894
...and he does care for my sister deeply.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.502
l think Kitty is blessed.

29:36.741 --> 29:39.676
l am blessed as well.

29:39.744 --> 29:42.941
My older sister is now spoken for.

29:43.014 --> 29:46.245
l am now free to receive
interest from anyone...

29:48.353 --> 29:50.947
...who might have interest.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.927
<i>(children laughing)</i>

30:00.532 --> 30:03.763
<i>(Kitty)</i> l'm going to get you. Oh!

30:03.835 --> 30:07.236
l got you. l got you.
Can you fetch a blanket for me?

30:07.305 --> 30:09.796
<i>(Ivy)</i> Have you seen Noah?

30:24.789 --> 30:26.950
<i>(loud thump)</i>

30:28.293 --> 30:30.124
Lucius?

30:48.213 --> 30:50.272
Lucius?

30:52.183 --> 30:54.174
<i>(growling)</i>

30:54.252 --> 30:56.083

31:35.727 --> 31:38.321
- <i>(man)</i> Hurry, to the cellar!
- <i>(woman)</i> Oh, good gracious!

31:38.396 --> 31:41.456
<i>(shouting and bell ringing)</i>

31:58.082 --> 32:00.676
- They're coming. They're coming.
- Close the door.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.310
- Noah, close the door, OK?
- They're coming.

32:02.387 --> 32:04.719
- Close the door.
- Coming!

32:06.991 --> 32:09.152
Here we go.

32:09.227 --> 32:12.196
- Noah, come on inside!
- <i>(Noah)</i> Come on inside!

32:13.431 --> 32:16.628

Everyone, inside!

32:39.557 --> 32:44.085

- Let's close the door.

32:44.162 --> 32:47.393
- <i>(Ivy)</i> Lucius is outside, walking.
- <i>(Noah)</i> They're coming.

32:47.465 --> 32:52.095
He's inside safe somewhere!
Please, close the door!

32:54.072 --> 32:56.802
He'll come back to make sure we're safe.

32:56.874 --> 32:59.502
lvy! lvy, please.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.825

- No.

33:31.909 --> 33:34.377
Don't let them in.

<i>(grunting)</i>

33:41.719 --> 33:43.550

35:03.234 --> 35:07.034
<i>(Walker) By the markings we find</i>
<i>this morning on our homes...</i>

35:09.407 --> 35:14.970
<i>...I feel they were warning us.</i>
<i>They acted as if threatened.</i>

35:15.046 --> 35:19.415
<i>(August) Creatures have never</i>
<i>attacked us without reason.</i>

35:19.484 --> 35:22.749
<i>Does anyone here know of a reason...</i>

35:23.888 --> 35:26.948
<i>...why these events may have occurred?</i>

35:34.599 --> 35:36.965
Who has written this note?

35:47.044 --> 35:49.035
<i>(clears throat)</i>

35:49.847 --> 35:52.475
''Please read so that all may hear.''

35:52.550 --> 35:55.178
''l have brought this burden upon us.''

35:57.922 --> 36:02.086
''On the day before last,
l crossed the forbidden line

36:02.160 --> 36:04.492
- into Covington Woods...''
- <i>(crowd gasps)</i>

36:04.562 --> 36:08.862
''...and was witnessed there

36:08.933 --> 36:11.800
''l am deeply sorry.''

''l have shamed myself and my family.''

36:15.706 --> 36:19.472
''l pray that my actions
will cause no further pains.''

36:19.544 --> 36:22.809
''With deepest sorrow, Lucius Hunt.''

36:22.880 --> 36:24.871
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

36:52.910 --> 36:55.003
ls he in trouble?

36:55.079 --> 36:57.070
<i>(laughing)</i>

37:07.358 --> 37:09.952
Do not fret.

37:18.636 --> 37:22.697
You are fearless in a way
that l shall never know.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.317
<i>(Walker)</i> We are grateful...

37:37.388 --> 37:39.788
...for the time we have been given.

37:39.857 --> 37:42.189
<i>(man)</i> Yes. Yes, indeed.

37:43.194 --> 37:46.061
<i>(all start talking)</i>

37:46.130 --> 37:48.121
Cheers.

38:28.839 --> 38:31.399
<i>(distant singing)</i>

38:32.943 --> 38:35.673
l had an elder sister.

38:35.746 --> 38:38.613
Mrs. Clack, you've been keeping secrets.

38:40.184 --> 38:43.517
Oh, Kitty reminds me of her so.

38:45.856 --> 38:48.518
<i>(Ivy)</i> What manner of person was she?

38:50.261 --> 38:52.821
- Saucy.
- Oh.

38:52.897 --> 38:55.388
And we fought endlessly.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.636
May l ask her name?

39:05.876 --> 39:09.903
Why did she not come
to Covington Woods?

39:13.718 --> 39:17.245
My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.782
A group of men took her life
in an alley by our home.

39:26.630 --> 39:29.064
Please rise!

39:29.133 --> 39:31.124
Come on.

40:04.735 --> 40:08.762
She's not going to squeeze
my shirt like that, is she?

40:11.275 --> 40:13.266
<i>(muffled conversation)</i>

40:20.751 --> 40:25.415
Many blessings
on this most joyous of days.

40:25.489 --> 40:28.049
lt was a rare and lovely ceremony,
was it not?

40:28.125 --> 40:30.116
Glorious.

40:32.396 --> 40:37.060
l saw your hand move to your eyes
on more than one occasion.

40:37.134 --> 40:39.762
That must have been dust of some matter.

41:47.204 --> 41:49.434
<i>(scream)</i>

41:54.144 --> 41:56.135

<i>(murmuring)</i>

42:13.264 --> 42:15.664
<i>(man)</i> Behind them.

42:15.733 --> 42:18.099
<i>(man #2)</i> How did she deal
with this brightness?

42:18.168 --> 42:21.194
<i>(woman)</i> Help us out.

42:21.272 --> 42:23.172
<i>(man #3)</i> Where are
the rest of them?

42:27.611 --> 42:29.772
Speak up.

42:31.015 --> 42:33.313
- They're in the village.
- What?

42:33.384 --> 42:35.545
They left more warnings.

42:35.619 --> 42:38.019
They wish us to leave.

42:38.088 --> 42:40.420
That cannot be.

42:40.491 --> 42:43.289
One saw us.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.555
lt ran off into the darkness.

42:45.629 --> 42:48.097
You are certain?

42:55.606 --> 42:57.767
Can you boys stay close to lvy here?

42:57.841 --> 43:01.470
She'll tell you some funny stories
and have you laughing soon.

43:09.720 --> 43:12.211
We will go together.

43:17.127 --> 43:19.118
<i>(children whimpering)</i>

44:08.979 --> 44:12.039
<i>(Alice) Livestock has been taken</i>
<i>and skinned.</i>

44:13.017 --> 44:15.485
The hides and feathers are missing.

44:15.552 --> 44:20.615
There are marks on the door
where it was opened.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.554
The marks are high.

44:26.630 --> 44:30.157
Coyotes cannot reach that height.

45:08.205 --> 45:10.036
<i>(gasps)</i>

45:32.596 --> 45:36.157
<i>(Alice)</i> The elders are going to have
an inquiry tomorrow.

45:36.233 --> 45:40.897
Each member of the village is to be
questioned in the meeting hall.

45:40.971 --> 45:43.337
<i>(Lucius)</i> To see how
the border was breached?

45:43.407 --> 45:45.398
<i>(Alice)</i> Yes.

45:50.247 --> 45:52.374
lt is cold outside.

45:52.449 --> 45:54.747
You ought to go in.

45:57.454 --> 46:01.083
Why are you on this porch?

46:01.158 --> 46:03.251
lt is not safe.

46:03.327 --> 46:05.591
There are other porches.

46:09.099 --> 46:11.863
Do you find me too much of a tomboy?

46:13.237 --> 46:15.933
l do long to do boy things...

46:16.640 --> 46:20.076
...like that game
the boys play at the stump.

46:20.144 --> 46:22.942
They put their backs to the woods,

46:23.013 --> 46:26.881
and see how long they can wait
before getting scared.

46:28.852 --> 46:31.821
That's so exciting.

46:33.257 --> 46:35.691
l understand you hold the record.

46:36.894 --> 46:40.990
lt will never be broken, they say.

46:41.064 --> 46:44.591
lt's just children's games.

46:44.668 --> 46:48.900
How is it you are brave when all
the rest of us shake in our boots?

46:51.275 --> 46:56.941
l do not worry about what will happen,
only what needs to be done.

47:00.217 --> 47:02.208
How did you know l was here?

47:02.286 --> 47:04.618
l saw you out the window.

47:06.590 --> 47:08.490
No...

47:08.559 --> 47:11.494
...l won't tell you your color.

47:11.562 --> 47:14.156
Stop asking.

47:18.302 --> 47:22.466
When we are married,
will you dance with me?

47:22.539 --> 47:25.997
l find dancing very agreeable.

47:30.647 --> 47:33.707
Why can you not say what is in your head?

47:37.020 --> 47:40.080
Why can you not stop saying
what is in yours?

47:42.492 --> 47:46.690
Why must you lead, when l want to lead?

47:46.763 --> 47:50.426
lf l want to dance, l will ask you to dance.

47:50.500 --> 47:54.960
lf l want to speak,
l will open my mouth and speak.

47:56.173 --> 47:59.370
Everyone is forever
plaguing me to speak further.

48:00.944 --> 48:03.208
Why? What good is it to tell you

48:03.280 --> 48:06.147
you are in my every thought
from the time l wake?

48:06.216 --> 48:09.777
What good can come from my saying
l-l sometimes cannot think clearly,

48:09.853 --> 48:12.754
or do my work properly?

48:12.823 --> 48:18.193
What gain can rise from my telling you
the only time l feel fear as others do...

48:19.997 --> 48:22.557
...is when l think of you in harm?

48:24.968 --> 48:28.096
That is why l am on this porch, lvy Walker.

48:30.374 --> 48:33.468
l fear for your safety before all others.

48:38.015 --> 48:40.006
And, yes...

48:41.685 --> 48:44.813
...l will dance with you
on our wedding night.

<i>twice to fetch food</i>

<i>(Alice) And the livestock</i>
<i>was untouched at that time?</i>

ls it true... about Lucius and lvy?

49:34.404 --> 49:37.237
There are whispers all over the village.

49:40.510 --> 49:45.345
We were informed early this morning
of their intentions.

49:45.415 --> 49:50.250
lt is amazing to witness
which two people love chooses to unite.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.880
lt follows no rules.

49:55.525 --> 49:58.858

49:58.929 --> 50:03.992
l would not want you to feel pain,
in any fashion.

50:04.067 --> 50:07.195
You are my cherished one.

50:07.270 --> 50:11.604
lf you were to feel badly
about Lucius, l would not have it.

50:11.675 --> 50:15.873
One love to sacrifice
another love is not right.

50:20.817 --> 50:25.379
There is nothing you could do
that would sacrifice my love for you.

50:26.923 --> 50:29.983
You are my cherished one as well.

50:38.769 --> 50:41.636
God bless you and your life together.

51:30.020 --> 51:32.511

- What is it?

54:06.509 --> 54:09.103
There's been an accident.

54:21.024 --> 54:26.621
Noah Percy was found with quarts
of blood upon his clothes and hands.

54:27.230 --> 54:30.358
The blood was not his own,
and he will not speak as to whose it is.

54:30.433 --> 54:33.561
God in heaven.

54:33.637 --> 54:34.729

that can be done to mend the boy?

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:26.678
Please, Victor. Would you be so kind
as to answer my question?

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:39.191
<i>(Victor) If the infection is contained,</i>
<i>he may still survive.</i>

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:44.665
l must speak up.

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:48.971
You have a restless spirit.

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.570
l know the thing that is in your head.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:57.047
You're thinking of going to the towns.

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:00.353
Tell me l'm wrong.

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:07.819
You have made an oath, Edward,
as all have, never to go back.

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:11.890
lt is a painful bargain,
but no good can come without sacrifice.

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:15.335
These are your words l'm saying.
You cannot break the oath.

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.896
- lt is sacred.
- lt is a crime,

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:20.636
what has happened to Lucius.

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:24.642
You have taken the oath.

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:28.616
You and the rest of the elders...
Are you listening to me?

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.676
You...

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:34.685
...have taken the oath.

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:05.585
The moment l heard my daughter's
vision had finally failed her,

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:09.591
and that she would forever be blind,
l was sitting in that very chair.

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:15.056
l was so ashamed.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:22.669
What do you know about your grandfather?

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:28.037
He was the wealthiest man in the towns?

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:31.274
That he was. He had a gift for that.

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:37.343
lf he was given one dollar, in less than a
fortnight, he would have turned it into five.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:41.553
You do not know of money.
lt is not part of our life here.

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:44.354
Money can be a wicked thing.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:48.557
lt can turn men's hearts black -
good men's hearts.

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:52.397
My father could not see this.
For all his gifts,

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:57.963
he was a poor judge of a man's character.
Your grandfather was a good man, lvy.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.531
He had a laugh that could
be heard three houses away.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.670
He used to hold my hand as l hold yours.

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:06.772
He taught me strength
and showed me love,

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:12.913
and told me to lead
when others would only follow.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.488
Your grandfather, James Walker,
died in his sleep.

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:24.294
A man put a gun to his head
and shot him while he dreamed.

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:30.431
l tell you this so you will understand
some of the reasons for my actions,

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.235
and...

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:36.575
...and the actions of others.

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:43.918
You are a strong one, lvy.
You lead when others would follow.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:47.945
You see light
when there is only darkness.

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:55.027
l trust you.

01:03:56.899 --> 01:04:00.767
l trust you among all others.

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.698
Thank you, Father.

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:09.404
lvy, do you know where you are?

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:13.609
At the old shed that is not to be used.

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.276
Yeah.

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:23.623
- lvy.
- Yes, Father?

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:27.418

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:17.875

you needn't be scared.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.840
We have the magic rocks.

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.941
They will keep us safe.

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:41.119
Why have we not heard
of these rocks before?

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:45.353
Christop, please.
Do not leave us.

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:47.589
There is nothing to fear.

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:52.466
Then why do you wear the cloak
of the safe color?

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:55.299
We will light torches.

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:58.169
lt will be safe.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.231

lt turns my stomach to rot.

You will be safe. They will not harm you,
because you cannot see.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.974
They will take pity on you,
the way they took pity on Noah

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.712
when... when he ventured in the woods.

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:24.492
They will kill me, lvy.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:27.522

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:37.734
You're better in these woods
than most boys. Anyone would say so.

lt is my burden, Finton.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:45.103

lt is only farce.

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:18.002
Do not be frightened.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:34.286
There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:38.349
lt is in one of the history books
l used to teach in the towns.

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:42.561
The screams from the woods?

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.563
We created those sounds.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:50.161
The Ceremony of Meat?

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:54.676
We remove it ourselves.
An elder is always assigned.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:58.076
The drills -
they are farce, too?

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.480
We did not want anyone
to go to the towns, lvy.

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:08.553
What about the animals -
the skinned ones?

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:13.755
- Are the elders responsible for that, too?
- l believe one of the elders is responsible.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:16.093
lt will not happen again.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:20.067
There is no one in this village
who has not lost someone irreplaceable,

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:26.802
who has not felt loss so deeply that they
questioned the very merit of living at all.

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:29.366
lt is a darkness l wished...

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:32.711
...you would never know.

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:40.353
Forgive us our silly lies, lvy.
They were not meant to harm.

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:53.528
l am... sad for you, Papa.

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:58.470
For all the elders.

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:12.651
On this paper has been written
a tool of medicine.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:14.746
lt is common in the towns.

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:18.452
You will go... with two escorts.

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:21.653
Follow the sounds of the stream.

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:25.097
A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:29.365
At this hidden road, the two escorts
will wait as you continue.

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:33.602
You alone will follow the road...

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:38.409
...and leave Covington Woods.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.349
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.819
...and return with haste.

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:50.890
l cannot come with you.

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.424
You gave your heart to this boy.

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:02.599
He is in need.

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:07.634
Are you ready to take this burden,

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:12.703
which, by right,
is yours and yours alone?

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:25.421
l am making fresh cloths for Lucius.
He needs them.

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:27.758
Alice, l've sent for help.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.126
l've sent lvy to the towns.

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.797
You cannot.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.601
lt is all that l can give you.

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:55.212

- He is the victim of a crime.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:31.186
We have agreed never to go back. Never.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.751
What was the purpose of our leaving?

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:38.960
Let us not forget it was out of hope
of something good and right.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.264
You should not have made
decisions without us.

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:44.362
- You have gone too far.
- l'm guilty, Robert!

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:50.104
l made a decision of the heart.
l cannot look into another's eyes

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:55.582
and see the same look
l see in August's without justification!

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:58.779
lt is too painful. l cannot bear it!

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:01.948
You have jeopardized
everything we've made.

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:09.490
Who do you think
will continue this place, this life?

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:14.525
Do you plan to live forever?

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:18.502
lt is in them that our future lies.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:23.273
lt is in lvy and Lucius that
this... this way of life will continue.

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:27.340
Yes, l have risked! l hope l am always able

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:31.113
to risk everything
for the just and right cause.

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:39.423
lf we did not make this decision, we could
never again call ourselves innocent.

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:44.830
And that, in the end, is what we
have protected here - innocence!

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:48.663
That, l'm not ready to give up.

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:57.403
Let her go.

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:02.213
lf it ends, it ends.

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:10.322
We can move towards hope.
lt's what's beautiful about this place.

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:14.328
We must not run from heartache.

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:17.355
You know, my brother
was slain in the towns.

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:19.423
The rest of my family died here.

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:22.993
Heartache is a part of life.
We know that now.

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.938
lvy's running toward hope.
Let her run.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:31.134
lf this place is worthy,
she'll be successful in her quest.

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:36.517
How could you have sent <i>her?</i>

01:17:36.585 --> 01:17:38.746

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:43.655
She's more capable
than most in this village...

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:48.459
...and she is led by love.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.988
The world moves for love.

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:25.293

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:29.497
? How the blossoms grow

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:33.632
