WEBVTT

01:38.348 --> 01:39.432
Freydis!

02:48.042 --> 02:49.711
Romanos told me everything.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.758
You only wanted a child.

03:00.597 --> 03:04.017
It became clear early in our marriage
that he couldn't have children.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.019
He had tried with other wives.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.689
We both agreed
you were the best choice for the father.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.696
You never wished me to have everything.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.703
And you never wished me for your wife.

03:24.829 --> 03:30.251
I had to use your appetite
to get what I needed.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.428
What of my men?

03:41.054 --> 03:43.514
Maniakes has turned your trial
over to the Church.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.476
The Patriarch will lead it.

03:48.353 --> 03:52.565
He knows your Varangians won't go
against the Church, even for you.

03:54.817 --> 03:58.655
He also knows that
it makes me powerless to pardon you.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.453
I'm sorry, Harald.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.041
I did not mean for any of this to happen.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.132
You did not lead me into this trap.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.927
It was my greed.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.161
I want more fires lit.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.082
The place must glow!

04:51.165 --> 04:53.751
She hasn't seen them
in over seven years.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.921
No sign of our future king?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.047
Hmm?

05:01.592 --> 05:06.264
It would be most fortuitous
if the heir was born on Canute's arrival.

05:06.472 --> 05:10.393
It may come as a shock to you, Mother,
that you cannot control everything.

05:10.518 --> 05:14.480
Well, I know I can't, but there are herbs
one can take to bring on the birth.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.441
You're not serious.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.193
Queen Aelfgifu!
Canute's fleet! It is here.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.904
Well, don't just stand there,
get on with your work.

05:21.988 --> 05:26.200
He's coming. He's coming.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.039
Cold water!

05:38.463 --> 05:42.050
It is good to be back on Viking land!

05:44.469 --> 05:48.264
And even better to be in Kattegat!

05:55.563 --> 05:56.647
King Canute!

05:57.648 --> 06:00.818
May God bless you all!

06:04.197 --> 06:06.032
- Your Highness.
- Thank you so much.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.535
Father, welcome to Kattegat.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.248
Svein, this is Queen Emma

06:15.083 --> 06:18.753
and this is your half-brother,
Harthacanute.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.090
Thank you for arranging
a warm arrival, King Svein.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.342
It is my pleasure, Queen Emma.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.220
Welcome, Hartha.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.892
Father, this is my wife, Katla.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.813
My lord and lady, I'm honored.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.399
It is nice to finally meet you, Katla,

06:40.483 --> 06:44.821
and maybe I will get to meet a grandson
before we leave.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.699
I will do what I can, my lord.

06:48.783 --> 06:52.078
Your Highness, welcome to Kattegat.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.746
We are happy to be here, Katla.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.457
And who are the Normans?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.586
They are Emma's sons
from her first marriage,

07:01.254 --> 07:03.589
Alfred and Edward.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.049
You brought them here?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.137
I see your visit has a wider purpose.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.138
It does.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.933
Where's your mother, King Svein?

07:15.143 --> 07:17.937
Waiting for us in the Great Hall.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.274
Anxiously.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.279
Perhaps you will show my two boys
and Harthacanute around Kattegat

07:26.362 --> 07:28.448
while I pay my respects to her?

07:28.531 --> 07:33.119
Come. We will start
in the oldest part of Kattegat

07:33.202 --> 07:38.541
where they say a Völva hides
who is over 100 years old.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.625
What's a Völva?

07:40.835 --> 07:41.669
A witch!

07:42.795 --> 07:45.548
A Viking witch? What a terrifying concept!

07:51.095 --> 07:52.013
Steady.

07:54.390 --> 07:57.059
Home to feast on fish, huh?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.854
Just wait till they see
how much you've caught, little bear.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.063
Ready the rope!

08:01.147 --> 08:03.900
You will be the hero
of all Greenland tonight!

08:05.193 --> 08:06.402
Pitch the oars!

08:08.946 --> 08:10.781
Akí, you are a great sea captain.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.117
You remind me of myself
when I was younger.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.495
That is the greatest compliment
my father can give.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.207
Well then, I am honored.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.253
Where's the other boat?

08:25.171 --> 08:26.506
Your father's men took it.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.632
Who?

08:27.715 --> 08:30.426
Lang and Vilfil, right after you left.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.262
Then it is safe.
They know what they're doing.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.057
They had no right to take it
without permission.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.309
You said you would help us.

08:38.392 --> 08:42.021
We cannot live on fish alone,
we must have goods to trade.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.191
Bear fur, sealskin, narwhal tusks,

08:45.274 --> 08:47.318
so when the traders come,
we can stand proud.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.487
And that's all thanks to you, daughter.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.907
Come, Harald! We must tell grandmother

08:52.990 --> 08:54.742
how you caught the giant fish.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.996
There is something I must show you.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.541
The lock is broken.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.628
Half of our supplies
have been siphoned off in this way.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.132
You know who's doing it?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.175
It's everyone.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.719
You can't blame them
after all they've been through.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.845
If we wait much longer,

09:14.929 --> 09:17.014
there will be nothing left
for us to take.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.894
From now on, we will guard the storehouse.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.062
Tell the others.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.570
It's time for us to leave.

09:45.876 --> 09:49.463
Queen Emma, welcome to my home.

09:51.632 --> 09:55.136
Queen Aelfgifu,
I am grateful for your welcome.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.517
My husband will be along shortly.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.562
I asked if I could precede him.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.107
We are honored by your visit.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.360
I'm afraid it is a far cry from London.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.948
It is everything I hoped
it would be and more.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.075
Indeed.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.828
Canute is dying.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.250
Is this a fact that is well-known?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.377
No.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.967
You're one of the few.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.061
For you to share this with me,

10:45.144 --> 10:49.065
you're either a very trusting woman
or a naive one,

10:49.148 --> 10:50.608
and I know you to be neither.

10:53.069 --> 10:57.073
I have told you so that you can
appreciate the full reason for his visit

10:57.156 --> 10:59.033
and not waste it on pettiness.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.291
Thank you.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.841
We both also have sons
in line for his throne

11:17.802 --> 11:21.472
and I have no doubt your feelings
are as strong as mine for their success.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.266
That is true.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.899
And do you have knowledge
of Canute's plans for succession?

11:32.942 --> 11:37.822
No, other than he intends
to use all his power to ensure

11:37.905 --> 11:41.700
that no family blood is spilled
from his passing.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.870
How like him.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.999
Yes, very much like him.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.555
And how are you?

12:05.474 --> 12:06.600
I'm going to miss him.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.105
This is the Great Hall…

12:11.188 --> 12:12.022
Come back!

12:12.106 --> 12:17.820
…Home of Ragnar Lothbrok, Bjorn Ironside
and Ivar the Boneless!

12:19.697 --> 12:24.994
This is where I brought together
the great Viking armies of the North

12:25.077 --> 12:27.288
before we journeyed to London!

12:27.371 --> 12:31.459
Where our ancestors have for centuries
shared their stories,

12:32.084 --> 12:34.837
discussed business, politics

12:35.463 --> 12:38.966
the rule of law, ambition.

12:43.429 --> 12:47.808
Even you, Alfred,
have a connection to this place.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.561
Rollo, the first Norman Duke.

12:51.187 --> 12:54.398
Exactly. I have brought you here…

12:57.151 --> 12:59.987
to draw inspiration from this place.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.364
This place of heroes.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.117
Do I qualify as one?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.077
Is she the Völva?

13:09.371 --> 13:11.832
Well, I suppose that depends on
whom you ask.

13:13.876 --> 13:14.710
No.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.714
This is Queen Aelfgifu,

13:20.007 --> 13:21.675
the mother of King Svein

13:22.551 --> 13:24.762
and the Regent of Norway.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.433
This is her hall…

13:33.354 --> 13:35.314
and we will show her our respect.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.864
Friends, a great week of fishing

13:43.948 --> 13:46.784
and soon Lang and Vilfil will return
with bear fur,

13:46.867 --> 13:51.705
seal skins and narwhal tusks
and we can start trading again!

13:53.916 --> 13:59.713
Thank you, people of Jomsborg,
not only for sharing your boats,

13:59.797 --> 14:03.300
but for helping us
rebuild our farms and homes.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.846
And I know some of you
are getting very close.

14:10.432 --> 14:16.438
It brings me great joy
to see our two people become one family.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.066
And we will always be part of this family

14:19.984 --> 14:23.946
and we thank the gods we were able
to share with you in your time of need.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.739
- Yes.
- That is who we are.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.120
But we are leaving tomorrow.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.038
We can wait no longer.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.751
There are four extra seats on our boat.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.838
If anyone else wishes to join us,
let me know now.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.887
Freydis, may Signe come with us?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.638
If she wishes to.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.057
I do! Thank you.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.936
You're asking Greenlanders
if they want to leave Greenland?

14:57.104 --> 15:00.566
It is like, uh, asking fish
if they want to leave the ocean.

15:02.443 --> 15:07.865
This is our home.
We have no desire to leave.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.450
Is that so?

15:12.953 --> 15:14.788
Are you all happy to stay?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.667
I would like to come too.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.127
What are you doing?

15:20.210 --> 15:23.464
I'm an excellent sailor
and a hard worker.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.258
I would too.

15:28.135 --> 15:33.474
You would leave your families
and your homes on the promise of a story?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.769
I wish to come, Freydis.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.873
Maniakes has questioned us
about your time with the Empress.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.750
And what have you told him?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.043
That we saw nothing.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.130
Good. Continue to tell him that.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.675
It's the truth.

16:08.175 --> 16:13.180
Harald, we have always been loyal to you
and always will,

16:14.181 --> 16:16.392
but at some point
the truth cannot be hidden.

16:16.475 --> 16:21.563
I have always only asked
one thing from you… your trust.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.358
I ask it one more time.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.467
You are a brave man
to be this close to me right now.

16:50.551 --> 16:54.346
Please, go ahead and try and kill me.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.974
It will only strengthen
the case against you.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.684
What do you want?

16:59.685 --> 17:02.938
I know that you were sleeping
with the Empress.

17:04.356 --> 17:09.820
Crime against the Empire,
punishable by death for both of you.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.031
You have no proof.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.290
It is only a matter of time,

17:21.373 --> 17:26.503
and when I do, the Empress
and all your loyal Varangians

17:26.587 --> 17:30.924
who have lied to protect your secret

17:32.342 --> 17:35.637
will join you at your execution.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.817
You challenged my leadership.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.778
And you ridiculed mine.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.240
You took advantage of my generosity
and treated me like a fool.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.618
You know full well
if we remain here much longer,

17:57.701 --> 17:59.328
we will have no option but to stay.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.622
You robbed me of my people!

18:01.705 --> 18:03.457
They are not your prisoners!

18:03.540 --> 18:06.168
You should not dictate
their destinies or mine.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.505
I'm leaving you my second ship
and seeds for the spring.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.632
What is that? Charity?

18:12.216 --> 18:17.137
Yes. I do not wish to see my mother die
because of your stubbornness.

18:47.126 --> 18:52.131
Alexius by the grace of God,
Archbishop of Constantinople,

18:52.214 --> 18:55.592
New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch.

19:06.145 --> 19:10.816
Harald Sigurdsson, you are brought
before this court of Christ

19:10.899 --> 19:13.569
charged with the most heinous of crimes:

19:14.319 --> 19:18.991
the murder of our beloved
and great Emperor Romanos Argyros.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.701
I did not kill him.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.288
I loved Romanos with all my heart.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.500
I was with the Emperor
more than anyone here.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.502
If I wished to kill him,

19:30.586 --> 19:33.881
why would I have done it at a party
filled with witnesses?

19:34.923 --> 19:37.384
There was a woman there who killed him.

19:39.094 --> 19:42.723
This woman you claim killed Romanos,

19:44.057 --> 19:45.350
can you describe her?

19:46.310 --> 19:49.479
She was wearing a gold mask
that covered her face.

19:49.605 --> 19:53.066
What color was her hair?

19:54.193 --> 19:58.655
Do you know what costume
she was wearing, her jewelry,

19:59.323 --> 20:01.033
so that we might track her down?

20:02.659 --> 20:05.329
I have my men hunting for her as we speak.

20:06.663 --> 20:12.169
Holy Father, I have been accused
of the most heinous of crimes

20:13.629 --> 20:16.006
by a man who envies my success,

20:17.382 --> 20:20.719
a man who has everything to gain
from my downfall.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.932
He is yet to give a reason
why I would kill the man

20:25.015 --> 20:28.143
I have protected like a brother
for the last seven years.

20:30.145 --> 20:33.106
One word… ambition.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.484
We all have ambition.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.569
Not like yours.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.822
Not like Viking ambition.

20:41.657 --> 20:46.620
He was not satisfied
with being Spatharokandidatos.

20:46.703 --> 20:49.957
He strived to be more, to be Emperor.

20:50.666 --> 20:55.629
And he was aided in this quest
by a woman who plotted with him

20:55.712 --> 20:57.130
against her husband…

20:58.257 --> 21:02.010
and slept with Harald while they did it.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.680
The Empress Zoe.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.557
Silence!

21:08.350 --> 21:10.102
You have raised a serious accusation

21:10.185 --> 21:13.563
that places not one,
but many lives on trial.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.525
Can you prove this accusation of adultery?

21:18.735 --> 21:19.903
Bring him out.

21:21.363 --> 21:27.119
I present one of Harald Sigurdsson's
Varangian Guard.

21:35.002 --> 21:40.132
Tell me, you have served
Harald Sigurdsson for seven years.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.803
I have. He's a great leader.

21:46.430 --> 21:51.977
At any time did this great leader ask you

21:52.060 --> 21:55.856
to shield the adultery
that he is now accused of?

21:58.066 --> 22:01.236
No. I never saw anything.

22:03.947 --> 22:04.948
Never?

22:07.117 --> 22:08.535
Think carefully.

22:19.963 --> 22:23.550
I'll ask you
the question again.

22:23.633 --> 22:29.639
Did Harald Sigurdsson have sex
with the Empress Zoe?

22:40.734 --> 22:41.943
I will answer that.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.366
I did.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.876
But it was not as described by Maniakes.

22:58.001 --> 22:59.961
It was not an affair of the heart.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.381
It was against her wishes.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.884
I defiled her!

23:08.845 --> 23:10.680
My men have told the truth.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.017
They had no knowledge of my crime.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.104
And your meeting with the Emperor?

23:20.148 --> 23:27.114
When Romanos learned of the rape,
he confronted me and I killed him.

23:30.033 --> 23:32.452
You understand
that you have committed

23:32.536 --> 23:35.122
not one, but two capital offenses,

23:35.205 --> 23:39.334
murder and rape,
and have admitted to both?

23:41.378 --> 23:42.295
I do.

23:46.466 --> 23:51.388
By my decree, the Empress
and all others are exonerated,

23:51.471 --> 23:55.892
but Harald Sigurdsson, I condemn you
to the most horrific of deaths,

23:55.976 --> 23:58.895
an execution in front of your peers.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.649
May you spend eternity
paying for your sins in Hell.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.507
So this is the famous Kattegat?

24:28.967 --> 24:31.261
Where I arrive a prince and depart a king.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.453
I knew by his boots that he was lying.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.581
Father!

24:59.664 --> 25:02.125
Son, it is good to see you.

25:03.585 --> 25:07.130
Look at you,
you've grown into a strong young man.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.133
Fighting the Wends does wonders
for one's strength.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.426
Hmm.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.389
Queen Emma, as a young boy
I saw you and thought

25:16.473 --> 25:19.059
you were the most beautiful woman
I had ever seen.

25:19.976 --> 25:22.646
It would appear
my memories are all accurate.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.898
I see he takes after his father.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.234
Harefoot!

25:31.529 --> 25:33.365
Mother, I'd like you to meet…

25:34.824 --> 25:36.576
Earl Godwin of Wessex.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.954
Your mother and I are already acquainted.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.872
Yes, sadly so.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.044
My lord, my lady.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.963
How was Denmark?

25:48.797 --> 25:49.839
Enlightening.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.676
I see my children are blessed
with their Viking heritage.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.887
I learnt a great deal
that will stay with me forever.

25:55.971 --> 25:56.888
And Gytha?

25:56.972 --> 25:59.557
She's returned to England
with the children, milady.

25:59.641 --> 26:02.894
And where is my father?
Did he not travel with you?

26:04.271 --> 26:05.981
Your father is dead, my lord.

26:07.315 --> 26:09.401
He passed just before we left for Norway.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.237
Forkbeard is dead?

26:13.238 --> 26:14.281
Was he ill?

26:16.783 --> 26:19.369
No. No, he was…

26:23.832 --> 26:26.418
It was sudden, Your Highness,

26:26.501 --> 26:30.046
but expected given his age
and the circumstance he found himself in.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.799
He was not alone, however.

26:32.882 --> 26:36.970
He had his grandson's company
right up until the last breath.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.185
Well, thank God you were with him.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.063
Both of you.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.570
May his soul rest in peace.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.118
Amen.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.771
I trust this chamber is adequate
for a man of your status.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.483
Given our history,
I'd expect nothing more.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.985
I never forget a betrayal.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.323
Another thing…

27:40.450 --> 27:42.077
while you are my guest,

27:42.160 --> 27:44.704
I order that you keep your distance
from my son.

27:44.788 --> 27:48.208
I'm afraid you cannot order me
to do anything, Aelfgifu.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.794
I'm not a servant any longer,

27:50.877 --> 27:53.671
I'm a member of the Royal Family
by marriage.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.133
Furthermore, I could not do
what you requested

27:57.217 --> 28:00.178
because it runs counter
to a unique skill I possess.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.596
And what is that?

28:02.389 --> 28:04.224
That of always backing the winner.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.980
Edmund could never beat Canute,
thus I backed Canute.

28:11.064 --> 28:14.484
You could not beat Emma,
hence I backed the Queen.

28:15.819 --> 28:20.365
But Harefoot, given the correct guidance…

28:22.325 --> 28:23.451
could beat everyone.

28:26.746 --> 28:30.417
And you are the man
to provide that guidance?

28:36.798 --> 28:38.258
I do think I'll change rooms.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.510
- <i>You are here…</i>
- You are here…

29:24.971 --> 29:25.930
<i>…for your families!</i>

29:26.014 --> 29:27.223
…for your families.

29:30.643 --> 29:33.146
- <i>You are here…</i>
- You are here…

29:34.147 --> 29:35.398
<i>…for your honor!</i>

29:36.065 --> 29:37.442
…for your honor.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.196
<i>You are here…</i>

29:41.738 --> 29:42.739
You are here…

29:45.074 --> 29:49.245
because you are a Viking.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.174
I became a Viking that night.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.517
It is good to see you, Greenlander.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.144
'Tis good to see you, King Canute.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.063
Hmm.

30:28.535 --> 30:32.872
Without you, things might have turned out
very differently in London.

30:33.581 --> 30:34.499
For us both.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.046
And what became of your sister, uh…

30:41.130 --> 30:42.131
- Freydis?
- Freydis.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.050
I'm not sure.

30:45.718 --> 30:50.431
She went from here to Jomsborg,
but the settlement is now deserted.

30:51.057 --> 30:51.891
What happened?

30:54.143 --> 30:56.020
The plague or some sort of attack.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.232
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.903
She saved my son Svein's life
after she killed Olaf.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.780
She killed Olaf?

31:07.740 --> 31:08.950
You did not know that?

31:09.659 --> 31:11.786
Where have you been these past years?

31:12.662 --> 31:13.496
Uh…

31:14.372 --> 31:17.333
The Rus. Constantinople.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.419
Africa. Sicily.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.547
I served in the Varangian Guard
with Harald.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.257
Oh.

31:25.174 --> 31:31.180
So, he's forgotten his ambition
to become the next King of Norway, huh?

31:34.142 --> 31:36.352
I'm afraid only he can answer that.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.232
What brought you back here?

31:43.943 --> 31:46.279
I'm in search of a ship
and a crew to sail west

31:47.155 --> 31:49.157
to find the land I believe is out there.

31:52.452 --> 31:58.082
I remember you wanted nothing from me
for bringing down London Bridge.

31:59.584 --> 32:00.627
Ah…

32:05.423 --> 32:08.927
Let me now gift you a ship

32:09.886 --> 32:12.805
and a crew in my name.

32:14.599 --> 32:19.145
And may you bring glory to all Vikings
with your discovery.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.318
It would be an honor
to travel in your name.

32:31.282 --> 32:35.745
And, uh, what about you?
What brought you back to Kattegat?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.249
You remember that conversation
we had about our father's shadow?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.043
Yes.

32:43.544 --> 32:48.549
I have brought my sons here
to see who can step out of mine.

33:13.866 --> 33:14.701
No.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.576
Did you see your friends?

33:58.369 --> 34:02.707
You thought you were so clever,
but soon you will be killed

34:04.250 --> 34:09.088
and the name Harald Sigurdsson
will be forgotten.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.470
I strongly suggest that you kill me now,

34:16.387 --> 34:18.556
because if you wait for my execution,

34:19.307 --> 34:22.101
I promise I will take you to Hell with me.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.367
I can wait.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.450
Not yet, my friend.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.205
Not yet.

36:18.926 --> 36:20.595
Are we all ready for tomorrow?

36:20.678 --> 36:21.596
Ah, yes.

36:57.256 --> 36:58.549
Erik?

36:58.633 --> 37:00.343
Preparing for your voyage tomorrow?

37:00.885 --> 37:01.719
Yes.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.601
I have come to ask a favor.

37:09.936 --> 37:13.522
I was hoping you would be able
to convince Freydis

37:13.606 --> 37:15.149
to stay here a little longer.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.030
We both know the weather will change soon

37:21.906 --> 37:24.784
and the longer we stay
the harder the journey will become.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.372
Spoken like a true sea captain.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.010
You have a notch in your hull.

37:44.470 --> 37:45.304
What?

37:46.222 --> 37:48.307
You must have damaged it when you docked.

37:52.478 --> 37:53.312
Where?

38:31.726 --> 38:32.852
Shh.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.635
Where are we going,
grandfather?

39:07.636 --> 39:12.058
We're going on a journey to save everyone.
Are you ready?

39:12.141 --> 39:13.726
- Yes.
- Good.
