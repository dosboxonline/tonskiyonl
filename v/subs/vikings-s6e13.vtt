[Ragnar]
Previously on Vikings...

00:02.870 --> 00:05.173
Bjorn's death has left a hole
in all our lives.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.007
Kattegat has no ruler.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.510
We cannot wait for your child
to become ruler of Kattegat.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.579
-I would like to be queen.
-I know.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.481
Is this really what
you want to do, Ketill?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.516
Of course it is.
We did a terrible thing.

00:15.549 --> 00:16.884
I need redemption.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.153
So we commit our bodies
to the deep.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.388
[Ivar] Prince Dir.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.056
You will receive a dagger.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.024
That will be the signal
for you to flee from Kiev.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.994
I entrust you to safely convey
the Prince to Novgorod.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.529
Why did you want
to talk to me?

00:28.562 --> 00:30.598
I would like to have
a bodyguard of Vikings.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.733
I would trust you more than
my own guards.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.768
Except, perhaps, for Ivar.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.937
I know that Dir is still alive.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.739
We're waiting for his signal.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.708
I have decided to call
a meeting of the Althing.

00:40.741 --> 00:41.709
And you will support me?

00:41.742 --> 00:42.610
Of course.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.745
What is it you really want?

00:44.778 --> 00:46.247
I think you know.

King Ivar.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.265
What is it you want?

02:11.299 --> 02:13.434
I request an audience
with Prince Oleg.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.036
Unfortunately, the prince
is otherwise engaged.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.206
He is having a meeting
with Prince Igor

02:18.239 --> 02:20.140
and your brother, Hvitserk.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.375
May I not join them?

02:21.409 --> 02:23.177
I have no orders
to permit that.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.395
Hvitserk.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.165
Ivar. What do you want?

02:46.434 --> 02:48.168
How strange.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.871
Everyone has been asking
me today, "What do you want?"

02:51.672 --> 02:52.740
Well...

02:54.675 --> 02:56.710
I'll tell you what I want.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.380
I want access to
Prince Igor and Prince Oleg.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.483
But it seems, my brother,

03:02.516 --> 03:05.052
as if you are suddenly
standing in the way.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.087
What do you want to talk
to Igor about, huh?

03:08.789 --> 03:12.993
There are things
he ought to know.
Important things.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.195
Tell me, then.
I'll make sure he knows.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.867
See. You don't trust me, Ivar.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.835
You've never trusted me.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.170
You think I'm a fool.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.572
It's Oleg who thinks
you're a fool.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.340
What does he give you, huh?

03:26.374 --> 03:27.841
He must give you something.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.345
Oleg treats me well.
He values me.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.914
Not like you, Ivar.
You've always treated me
like shit.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.384
You are my brother.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.218
My own flesh and blood.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.154
What in Odin's name does Oleg
mean to you, huh?

03:41.188 --> 03:43.324
Huh?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.058
I'll tell you
what he means to me.

03:45.092 --> 03:48.128
He is the future ruler
of Constantinople.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.063
The future ruler of the world.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.900
What are you, huh?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.236
Sad, poor Ivar.

[Gunnhild] I want to tell you

so we can elect a new ruler.

The time of mourning
and grieving is over.

Any person in Kattegat
is naturally free to stand.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.390
I want to tell you now
that I intend to stand.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.460
I do so in honor
of my late husband.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.629
If elected,

06:35.663 --> 06:39.032
I will do my best
to defend Kattegat
against the Rus

06:39.066 --> 06:41.435
or any other aggressor.

06:41.469 --> 06:44.638
I will continue with the work
that Bjorn and I did

06:44.672 --> 06:46.574
to build our defenses

06:46.607 --> 06:47.875
and shape our future.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.409

06:49.443 --> 06:51.178
I am not Bjorn's only widow.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.147
Let Ingrid tell you
her intentions.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.288
I too intend to stand.

07:02.623 --> 07:06.694
You see, I am
carrying Bjorn's child.

07:06.727 --> 07:11.465
For me, I will simply
be nurturing the only
legitimate heir of Kattegat.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.667
The true descendant
of Bjorn Ironside,

07:13.701 --> 07:16.570
Ragnar Lothbrok,
and our god Odin,

07:16.604 --> 07:17.705
the All-father.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.808
I too will fight for Kattegat.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.780
Erik,

07:28.215 --> 07:31.184
you were a staunch supporter
of my husband.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.888
You saved his life,
and all of us are grateful.

07:34.922 --> 07:38.258

to support in this election?

07:39.727 --> 07:40.761
[clears throat]

07:42.496 --> 07:45.198

I have not yet made up my mind.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.034
[murmurs]

07:47.067 --> 07:49.803
I will decide in due course,
having weighed everything up,

07:49.837 --> 07:52.806
knowing the debt I owe to Bjorn
to make the right decision.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.009
Why don't you stand yourself?

07:56.043 --> 07:58.378

all those years ago.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.051
Which way did you steer?

08:39.319 --> 08:40.788
West-northwest.

08:40.821 --> 08:41.722
Why?

08:42.556 --> 08:43.423
God told me to.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.460
Your God told you to?

08:48.395 --> 08:49.296
Yes.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.600
He spoke to me in the silence.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.602
And I listened.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.909
Why doesn't the water
in the sea just run away?

09:01.942 --> 09:04.244
It's because of the serpent
Jormungandr,

09:04.277 --> 09:06.546
the enemy of the gods.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.882
Have you heard of the time
the mighty Thor went fishing?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.550
No.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.620
He baited his hook
with the head of an ox,

09:12.653 --> 09:15.388
and cast his line down
into the dark water.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.424
Jormungandr took the bait.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.827
The serpent lashed the sea
into a frenzy

09:19.860 --> 09:22.596
but the thunder god
did not loosen his grip. No.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.932
He dragged the monster up
under the keel

09:24.965 --> 09:26.900
and began to haul it
over the gunwale.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.568
He took out his hammer

09:28.602 --> 09:30.738
and it sung a grisly song

09:30.771 --> 09:32.973
on the hairy head
of that terrible monster.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.174
[giggles]

09:37.611 --> 09:41.314
Jormungandr roared.
Midgard shuddered.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.784
And, at last, with a great
tearing of flesh,

09:44.952 --> 09:46.486
it set itself free.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.624
The serpent sunk once more

09:50.658 --> 09:52.025
to the bottom of the sea.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.000
I wish you hadn't
told me that story.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.376
You see?

10:12.445 --> 10:15.148
What?

10:15.182 --> 10:18.618
The way that Othere
always whispers
into Ubbe's ear.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.420
It makes me think
they are planning something.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.656
Against you?

10:22.690 --> 10:23.991
Why, why not against me?

10:24.024 --> 10:25.893
Of course, against me.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.295
I still wish we hadn't come.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.663
I worry about you, my dear.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.231
About me?

10:31.264 --> 10:32.399
Why do you worry about me?

10:33.433 --> 10:35.068
I didn't mean to say that.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.638
I don't worry about you.
It's Othere I worry about.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.040
You have a woman's intuition.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.142
Othere is dangerous.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.664
Brother, I have to talk to you
about Igor.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.399
It's important.
You have to listen--

11:06.433 --> 11:07.735
Prince Oleg wants to see you.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.036
I said, you have to
listen to me.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.804
He wants to see you. Now.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.107
-Hvitserk.
-I told you.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.809
Now.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.464
We have been neglecting you.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.234
My dear Ivar.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.974
After the defeat,
I lost my faith...

11:48.008 --> 11:49.910
I God, in you, in everyone.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.046
I was suspicious.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.614
I saw betrayal everywhere.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.650
I neglected you.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.754
I thought harsh thoughts
about you.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.356
For which, my friend,
I ask your forgiveness.

12:10.497 --> 12:14.067
My darling wife interceded
on your behalf.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.469
She said I was so cruel,

12:16.503 --> 12:20.640
that I had no cause
to be suspicious of you.

12:20.673 --> 12:25.745
Your brother, Hvitserk,
wasn't always so kind.

12:25.779 --> 12:29.282
I believe that he loves
and hates you in equal measure.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.352
He's no real use to me.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.656
If you like,
I will have him killed.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.596
No.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.665
If anyone kills him,
it should be me.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.902

fecund earth.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.835
Summon us by magic.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.010

and the living praise you

14:40.013 --> 14:43.984

Get the tent.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.394
Tie it. Quickly.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.469
What's that?

15:36.503 --> 15:37.637
Just a storm.

Don't be afraid.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.478
I don't recognize you.
Who are you?

17:27.013 --> 17:29.149
We're not Rus.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.284
You're looking out for
the Rus, aren't you?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.157
I'm glad you're so alert.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.458
I still don't know
who you are.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.562
Of course not.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.431
When you're looking for
something else,

17:44.464 --> 17:46.666
you don't even see
what's happening
right under your nose.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.562
There are no other candidates.

18:16.829 --> 18:17.964
Only you and Ingrid.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.568
Why has no one else
come forward?

18:23.069 --> 18:24.237
Isn't it obvious?

18:25.872 --> 18:29.008
This election is still about
Bjorn and his legacy.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.410
How could it be
about anything else?

18:32.044 --> 18:33.480
Have you made
your mind up, Erik?

18:34.581 --> 18:35.648
Who will you support?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.588
Erik was just explaining
about the voting.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.890
I heard.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.292
Now it is up to the people.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.894
Yes.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.429
Now it is up to the people.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.444
You know, don't you?

19:05.412 --> 19:06.579
You were watching.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.348
Yes.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.455
I would prefer it
if it could be our secret.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.391
But if you want
to tell the world--

19:18.425 --> 19:19.959
No, I will not tell the world.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.232
Good. I hope I can rely
on your support.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.090
Price Dir is ready.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.856
[Guard] Go on.
Let him through.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.703
You think
Prince Oleg loves you?

22:19.071 --> 22:21.040
He doesn't love you.
He despises you.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.575
Oh, you're just
saying that, Ivar--

22:22.609 --> 22:24.411
Shut up and listen to me.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.579
I met him yesterday.

22:26.613 --> 22:29.449
He asked me if I wanted
to have you killed.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.853
I could have said yes.

22:36.623 --> 22:37.824
Perhaps you should have.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.529
I would have never said yes.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.736
In any case, I need you.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.639
Somehow, we have to spirit
Prince Igor out of here,

22:52.672 --> 22:54.941
and join with Prince Dir's army
in Novgorod.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.745
I cannot do that on my own.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.582
Well,

23:02.615 --> 23:04.551
since it's my fate to kill you,

23:07.554 --> 23:09.956
it makes sense for me
to stay with you, I suppose.

23:17.363 --> 23:20.500
Do you have any idea
how we can get Igor
out of Kiev?

23:23.503 --> 23:26.839
Prince Oleg told me with pride

23:26.873 --> 23:30.242
that the patriarch is sending
the first metropolitan bishop
to Kiev

23:30.276 --> 23:31.444
to celebrate Easter.

23:32.979 --> 23:36.483
The Christian faith
is new here.

23:36.516 --> 23:39.085
It will create huge excitement
throughout the town,

23:39.852 --> 23:40.887
even the country.

23:42.722 --> 23:47.794
Hundreds of Rus
will arrive to witness this.

23:47.827 --> 23:51.030
Everyone wants to watch
this Bishop Leon

23:51.063 --> 23:53.666
and his acolytes drag the cross
to the cathedral.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.336
When does the Bishop arrive?

23:58.738 --> 23:59.972
Tomorrow.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.774
And the ceremony
is the day after.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.919
[Ingvild] Oh, Aud.
Oh, Daughter.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.954
[praying in native tongue]

24:22.128 --> 24:23.530
We will be all right.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.197
Thor watches over us.

24:35.542 --> 24:38.778
[chanting in native tongue]

24:49.455 --> 24:50.790
[baby cries]

24:50.823 --> 24:51.924
[shushing]

24:57.797 --> 24:59.065
I see what's happening.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.668
Thor's gone fishing again.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.871
No, Asa. It's just a storm.
It will pass.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.305
Believe me, it will pass.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.711
[man grunting]

25:15.682 --> 25:16.583
[Viking] Ubbe.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.085
[waves crashing]

25:22.989 --> 25:24.490
Hey, help. Pull.

25:39.471 --> 25:40.640
Jormungandr.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.842
No. No.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.578
[shushing]

26:07.834 --> 26:08.901
Asa.

26:09.468 --> 26:10.536
Asa!

26:11.470 --> 26:12.471
Asa!

26:14.440 --> 26:16.408
Where are you, Asa?

26:16.442 --> 26:17.543
Where's my daughter?

26:18.310 --> 26:19.879
Where's my child?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.080
Where's my child?

26:21.914 --> 26:23.382
Asa!

26:24.250 --> 26:26.418
Asa... Asa!

26:27.553 --> 26:28.520
Asa!

26:32.759 --> 26:33.860
[Woman] Pull it over.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.733
No. No.

26:46.505 --> 26:47.539
[Viking] I can't see.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.548
Asa!

26:59.251 --> 27:01.353
[thunderclap]

27:59.812 --> 28:01.380
[Viking] Let's go.
Get inside.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.317
[blows horn]

28:06.685 --> 28:08.620
[panicked shouting]

28:34.847 --> 28:36.115
What is it?

28:36.148 --> 28:38.317
It's nothing.
Everything's fine.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.186
[Gunnhild] Ingrid.
What do you see?

28:43.856 --> 28:44.891
He's come back.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.861
Who? Who's back?

28:49.628 --> 28:51.263
Tell me, witch.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.999
-Witch?
-Who is it?

28:55.802 --> 28:56.836
Who is it?

28:58.237 --> 29:01.373
I told you. It's him.

29:16.388 --> 29:20.126
I'm very sorry
to interrupt this election.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.260
[chuckles]

29:27.399 --> 29:28.835
I like elections.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.540
I approve of elections.

29:37.709 --> 29:41.380
Oh, by the way, for those
who do not know who I am,

29:42.214 --> 29:43.749
my name is Harald.

29:45.084 --> 29:48.387
But my people call me
King Finehair.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.026
I used to be quite a player
around these parts.

29:56.028 --> 29:59.665
I was a friend of
Bjorn Ironside.

29:59.698 --> 30:03.870
I had a relationship
with his beautiful mother,

30:03.903 --> 30:04.937
Lagertha.

30:06.538 --> 30:10.843
I know Ragnar's sons.
No one better.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.212
I actually feel like
this is a homecoming.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.182
But things change.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.384
Of course they do.

30:19.618 --> 30:22.421
And, so, I have a new ally.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.957
His name is Skane.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.727
Not difficult to remember.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.530
And, as you all will discover,

30:31.563 --> 30:33.665
hard to forget.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.243
I have come to rescue you all.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.415
I loved Bjorn.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.483
No one can deny that.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.285
It's written in the sagas.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.820
It's written on the walls.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.592
I came to claim
what is rightly mine.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.536
Skogarmaor.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.443
A pirate and a murderer.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.380
We shall see
what to do with you.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.518
Gunnhild.

31:29.621 --> 31:32.091
My esteem for you
could not be higher.

31:32.124 --> 31:35.061
You are a beautiful
and extraordinary woman.

31:35.962 --> 31:38.164
Thank you.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.898
But your timing
could have been better.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.335
On the contrary.

31:43.369 --> 31:47.974
My timing was,
as usual, perfect.

31:50.509 --> 31:54.213
You have all gathered here
to elect a new ruler.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.883
Well, you don't have to worry

31:57.916 --> 32:00.352
worry about electing
a King of Kattegat

32:00.386 --> 32:03.055
because I was,
and I still am

32:03.089 --> 32:05.491
the elected
King of all Norway.

32:06.725 --> 32:10.696
And so I am still your king.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.865
I am still your king.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.869
I am still your king.

32:21.740 --> 32:26.912
And I promise to be
a just and fair-minded ruler.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.781
A strong ruler.

32:29.815 --> 32:31.050
A famous ruler.

32:31.083 --> 32:34.153
For I want my name
to be remembered

32:34.186 --> 32:36.888
for as long as the names
of Ragnar Lothbrok

32:36.922 --> 32:39.258
and Bjorn Ironside
are remembered.

32:45.397 --> 32:46.898
No one has to be afraid.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.269
There will be no killings.

32:52.471 --> 32:56.442
Skane's men,
they mean you no harm.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.144
They just want to belong here.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.181
They want to be
a part of the life

33:02.214 --> 33:04.083
of this great town of yours.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.322
[chuckles]

33:11.490 --> 33:13.959
Come. Come here, lad.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.061
[chuckles]

33:16.662 --> 33:18.930
We just have to learn
to love each other.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.468
Right, boy?

34:04.210 --> 34:05.043
What do you want?

34:26.998 --> 34:27.833
To us.

34:31.537 --> 34:32.504
[exhales]

34:35.741 --> 34:36.975
Life is strange.

34:38.043 --> 34:39.178
It's very strange.

34:42.348 --> 34:45.784
Many is the time that I thought
my creator would kill me,

34:46.885 --> 34:49.020
but I was always reprieved.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.122
Who knows why?

34:51.523 --> 34:52.524
But perhaps

34:53.859 --> 34:56.495
Odin still has plans for me.

34:56.528 --> 34:57.696
I know what you want.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.300
You want to be
just like Bjorn.

35:01.333 --> 35:04.002
You want to have
everything that Bjorn had.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.708
Is there anything wrong
to aspire to be like
one's hero?

35:11.243 --> 35:13.745
I was always fighting
against Bjorn,

35:13.779 --> 35:14.813
but one day I thought,

35:16.748 --> 35:19.084
I really love this man.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.286
I love this man.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.555
And I want to be like him.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.928
I want people to love me

35:29.961 --> 35:31.597
as much as they loved him.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.803
It seems to me that you
just take what you want.

35:39.405 --> 35:40.939
You don't care
if people love you.

35:44.810 --> 35:45.677
Yes.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.347
I was like that.

35:48.847 --> 35:49.781
I agree.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.151
I was angry
and I was jealous.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.091
I'm not jealous anymore.
I'm not angry anymore.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.795
But I am determined

36:03.829 --> 36:07.966
that between the three of us,
we will forge the future
of Kattegat.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.237
Skol.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.272
[exhales]

37:00.819 --> 37:03.589
Pst. Hvitserk. Wake up.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.458
It's time.

37:06.492 --> 37:08.994
[bell ringing]

37:17.869 --> 37:19.705
[indistinct chatter]

37:34.886 --> 37:36.755
It's time for you to rise,
Prince Igor.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.858
Today is a very special day.

37:39.891 --> 37:40.859
Yes.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.695
It's Good Friday.

37:43.729 --> 37:47.032
You know perfectly well
that it is special
in another way.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.735
And today you must do
everything we tell you.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.136
Without any question.

37:51.169 --> 37:53.805
If you don't,
we shall all be lost.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.774
You do understand that,
though, don't you?

38:18.464 --> 38:19.798
[gasps]

39:07.679 --> 39:09.481
Today is Good Friday.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.282
A special day.

39:11.316 --> 39:14.720
The day to commemorate
the crucifixion of the Lord.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.851
[indistinct chatter]

40:13.912 --> 40:16.214
[panting]

40:17.282 --> 40:20.418
[chanting in Byzantine Greek]

40:59.958 --> 41:03.294
[guards chattering]

41:03.328 --> 41:04.295
[guard] Who is that?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.101
Let us through.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.274
I don't recognize you.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.910
[Ivar] Open the gate, huh?

41:19.678 --> 41:21.246
Come on.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.114
We've all got somewhere else
we want to be.

41:27.919 --> 41:28.987
[Bishop Leon] My friends.

41:31.523 --> 41:32.991
Brothers in Christ.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.795
Remember this day.

41:38.163 --> 41:41.833
The day of our
dear Lord's crucifixion.

41:43.468 --> 41:44.435
Kneel...

41:46.572 --> 41:47.606
And pray.

41:53.344 --> 41:56.147
[speaks Byzantine Greek]

42:17.736 --> 42:18.870
Where is Prince Igor?

42:30.215 --> 42:31.549
[Ivar] Go. Hurry.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.592
[music playing]
