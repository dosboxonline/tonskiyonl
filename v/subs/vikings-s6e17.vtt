WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:02.741
[Ragnar]
Previously onVikings...

00:02.915 --> 00:04.700
There is
so little food.
So little water.

00:04.874 --> 00:06.093
That boy is just
the first of many.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.008
I'm married
to a witch.

00:08.182 --> 00:10.053
And the woman
that I loved is dead.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.751
I think ruling Kattegat
will be boring.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.144
You are unpredictable.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.493
-Anger is a gift!
-[straining]

00:15.667 --> 00:17.974
What is in here
is a gift!

00:18.148 --> 00:19.845
Be ruthless.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.673
We should never
have left Kattegat!

00:21.847 --> 00:23.110
The gods have
decided our fate.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.720
He no longer believes.
Do you, Ubbe?

00:24.894 --> 00:28.376
-Ubbe, no!
Stop it!
-[yelling]

00:28.550 --> 00:31.727
There's still something
left for us to do.
Together. This is it.

00:31.901 --> 00:35.078
Wessex remains the last
great kingdom of England.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.428
The Christian plague has
spread across the world!

00:37.602 --> 00:40.040
But you still claim
to be Vikings.
Then act like Vikings!

00:40.214 --> 00:42.216
Come with me,
and conquer King Alfred.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.174
[all chanting]
Hail Ivar! Hail Ivar!

00:44.348 --> 00:45.306
[yelling]

00:45.480 --> 00:47.438
["If I Had A Heart" playing]

01:40.274 --> 01:42.276
Do you
trust them?

01:42.450 --> 01:46.193
The Lothbroks?
Of course, I do not
trust them.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.543
They lie
about everything.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.327
But you're willing to
go to war with them.

01:50.501 --> 01:53.635
Of course. We understand
each other. I also lie.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.465
That's the way we proceed
and it seems to work.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.122
[Ingrid] Lying doesn't
always work with me.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.908
-Hello.
-My Lord.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.866
[Ingrid] Perhaps Ivar
has no intention
of coming back.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.129
Perhaps.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.133
And you also?

02:15.352 --> 02:17.311
[Erik] We are
making good your fleet.

02:17.485 --> 02:21.010
[sighs] This place
always reminds me
of the...

02:21.184 --> 02:23.360
The great
ship-builder Floki.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.276
Floki?

02:26.450 --> 02:28.887
Don't tell me you have
never heard of him.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.802
The famous
Ragnar Lothbrok

02:30.976 --> 02:33.109
sailed to England,
and then Frankia,

02:33.283 --> 02:35.546
then to Valhalla
on Floki's ships.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.287
[Erik] Did you know him?

02:37.461 --> 02:39.681
Of course, I knew him.

02:39.855 --> 02:40.812
Who didn't know him?

02:43.424 --> 02:45.077
Gone now.

02:45.252 --> 02:48.777
Perhaps all
the best ones
are gone.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.866
Floki used to say
that his ships

02:51.040 --> 02:53.042
never butted against
the waves like a goat,

02:53.216 --> 02:54.826
But moved through them,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.960
like a ripple.

02:58.134 --> 03:01.964
I hope our craftsmen
are as skillful as he was.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.186
Good work.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.192
I need to
speak with you.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.426
I think it is
still possible
that the Rus

03:29.600 --> 03:30.688
will return, and...

03:32.124 --> 03:33.604
attack Kattegat again.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.563
In which case,
I need to leave

03:35.737 --> 03:39.175
someone in charge here
who I can trust
to defend the town

03:39.349 --> 03:40.655
and look after
my interests.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.359
[sighs]

03:53.276 --> 03:54.234
This is your home.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.193
You belong to Kattegat.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.282
You no longer have to

03:59.456 --> 04:02.677
risk anything,
fear anything.

04:05.854 --> 04:06.811
So...

04:08.509 --> 04:09.988
[sighs]

04:10.162 --> 04:13.427
I have decided to leave you
in charge of Kattegat.

04:13.601 --> 04:18.475
Officially, you and Ingrid
will rule in my absence.

04:18.649 --> 04:23.263
In reality, I've decided
to appoint you
as temporary ruler.

04:25.221 --> 04:29.269
If you and Ingrid disagree,
you will have the last say.

04:31.706 --> 04:32.750
[Erik] Thank you.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.450
Why are you doing this?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.758
Things are coming
to a conclusion.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.634
One has to
make decisions.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.723
What do you mean
"coming to a conclusion"?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.379
I'm not entirely sure...

04:52.553 --> 04:54.294
But I can feel it
in my bones.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.132
What have you two
been talking about?

05:11.615 --> 05:12.921
The future!

05:15.315 --> 05:16.359
I'm going away.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.799
And you will
have to remain here,
to give birth to...

05:22.974 --> 05:23.932
our child.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.677
I've ordered
that you and Erik

05:29.851 --> 05:31.940
should be joint rulers
in my absence.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.509
I can rule.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.511
Erik can organize
the defenses.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.948
[Harald] You will be
joint rulers.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.646
That is my decision.

05:46.476 --> 05:49.566
I'm sure you two
will come to some...

05:51.394 --> 05:52.569
accommodation.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.360
Why leave
your land so soon?

06:08.280 --> 06:09.673
I'm Viking.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.983
I'm not one
for settling,

06:15.157 --> 06:16.376
for staying.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.857
I need to
travel onward.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.210
And one day,
I'm sure,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.561
we will all
be settled.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.391
But, in the meantime...

06:33.915 --> 06:36.787
I will still
repair my ships...

06:38.528 --> 06:41.401
and sharpen my ax
and go to sea.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.754
I like to feel
the sharp wind

06:46.928 --> 06:49.278
and the salt
spraying on my face.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.890
And when I feel that...

06:56.894 --> 06:58.069
I'm free.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.698
[groaning]

08:22.589 --> 08:24.025
[horn blowing]

08:24.199 --> 08:26.157
[overlapping shouting]

08:35.732 --> 08:37.517
[horn blowing]

08:43.871 --> 08:46.003
May the gods
be with you.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.179
-[Viking] Take it
on the other side!
-[people chattering]

09:16.817 --> 09:17.687
[Viking in native tongue]

09:17.861 --> 09:18.949
Now onward!

09:19.950 --> 09:21.735
[indistinct shouting]

09:58.119 --> 10:00.382
I never had any luck
with women.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.129
[Viking] Keep your eyes open!

10:11.436 --> 10:14.178
[Viking 2] Argh!
Bring more rope!

10:24.798 --> 10:26.626
[choir singing]

10:49.039 --> 10:52.086
[Bishop]
We thank God
in his mercy,

10:52.260 --> 10:55.742
that he has
protected Wessex
for so long

10:55.916 --> 10:59.746
from the depredations
of the Vikings and the pagans.

10:59.920 --> 11:05.142
Wessex gives thanks
to our gracious King Alfred,

11:05.316 --> 11:08.058
and to the providence
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.759
We pray to almighty God

11:12.933 --> 11:17.851
to give us the strength
to repel and slaughter
the heathen,

11:18.025 --> 11:23.117
should he ever return to
these blessed Christian lands.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.599
God save the King!

11:27.774 --> 11:29.819
[congregation]
God save the King!

11:29.993 --> 11:31.647
[Bishop]
God save Wessex!

11:31.821 --> 11:33.954
[congregation]
God save Wessex!

11:34.128 --> 11:36.652
[Bishop] And now,
let us say the prayer,

11:36.826 --> 11:39.220
which Jesus taught
to his disciples.

11:43.354 --> 11:44.312
[speaking Latin]

12:39.541 --> 12:40.281
[all] Amen.

12:41.978 --> 12:43.110
Amen.

12:50.247 --> 12:53.642
[Harald] I don't think
we should attack
the Royal Villa.

12:53.816 --> 12:57.907
The Saxons must have
increased its fortifications
and defenses.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.604
I agree.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.824
We must flush the King
out of his stronghold,

13:01.998 --> 13:04.566
force him to fight us at
a place of our choosing.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.133
Which would be?

13:13.053 --> 13:13.793
Here.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.535
Edington.
I remember it.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.842
Ragnar carried me
up the steep hill

13:20.016 --> 13:22.802
beyond the town
to the ramparts
of an ancient fort.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.805
Looking down
the valley below,
he said,

13:27.284 --> 13:29.721
"This is a perfect place
for a battle."

13:35.162 --> 13:37.207
-[indistinct chatter]
-[hammering]

13:53.789 --> 13:55.399
[sighs]

14:03.016 --> 14:05.279
[Hvitserk]
What are you thinking?

14:05.453 --> 14:08.848
I was thinking,
"I hope he doesn't drown."

14:20.685 --> 14:23.645
[rooster crowing]

14:36.745 --> 14:37.920
[gasps]

14:40.792 --> 14:42.707
What do you want?

14:44.405 --> 14:46.581
To take my place in your bed.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.193
Nothing has been decided.

14:50.367 --> 14:54.154
Harald is gone.
Likely never to return.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.287
And you never loved him.

14:58.636 --> 15:02.292
-That doesn't mean--
-Yes, it does.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.734
I am the king-maker.

15:09.909 --> 15:14.043
I saved Bjorn's life,
I saved Harald's life,

15:14.217 --> 15:17.612
and now,
I make myself king.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.921
And you will be my queen.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.929
Are you sure you really
want to marry a witch?

15:32.235 --> 15:35.935
Yes. I think
it would be very exciting.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.779
Take off your shirt.

15:56.216 --> 15:56.956
[chuckles]

16:07.227 --> 16:08.968
Now turn around.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.380
-[Ingrid grunts]
-[Erik gasps]

16:34.515 --> 16:36.647
I want to see the marks.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.258
[Erik gasping]

16:46.440 --> 16:47.180
[Ingrid grunts]

16:50.618 --> 16:52.315
[both grunting]

17:07.504 --> 17:08.984
[breathing heavily]

17:09.158 --> 17:10.464
[grunting]

17:15.469 --> 17:18.385
Come to bed, my king-maker.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.642
[indistinct chatter]

18:00.470 --> 18:02.081
[captain] A rider, my Lord.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.314
[breathing heavily]

18:18.488 --> 18:20.664
My Lord King,
I bring most urgent news.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.536
A new Viking army
is approaching Wessex.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.668
With at least 200 boats.

18:26.366 --> 18:29.064
Do we know who
these Vikings are?

18:29.238 --> 18:31.458
So it is said, my Lord King,

18:31.632 --> 18:35.984
they are Norwegians,
the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.035
[indistinct chatter]

18:47.387 --> 18:49.258
[Harald] I think
we have reached here.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.653
So far we haven't encountered
the Saxons, but from now on,

18:52.827 --> 18:56.135
we will have to pass
their villages and towns.

18:56.309 --> 19:00.400
And we don't want to risk any
large, unexpected encounter.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.533
I have no doubt
they know we're upon the river.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.927
That's why we should stop
trying to be invisible.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.843
On the contrary, we should
announce our presence,

19:09.017 --> 19:12.194
start spreading terror
among the local population.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.544
Hvitserk and I will take
a party out tomorrow.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.459
Hopefully, we can steal
some horses,

19:16.633 --> 19:19.506
and find out if Alfred
is mustering an army.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.206
[indistinct chatter]

19:26.339 --> 19:31.866
Our scouts tell us
that the Viking army
is encamped about here.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.608
It's possible that
they have plans to meet
with Viking settlements

19:34.782 --> 19:37.959
or war bands along
the Mercian border
or elsewhere.

19:38.133 --> 19:42.050
They may wish to increase
the size of their
already considerable force.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.965
Their army is far too big
to ignore,

19:44.139 --> 19:46.141
but we should try to engage it
on our terms.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.623
We should monitor
their movement...

19:49.797 --> 19:54.193
but at the same time,
prepare our own forces
to move here to Chichester.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.370
We have a large garrison there.
We have access to the sea.

19:59.546 --> 20:00.982
So we must evacuate here?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.463
Yes. [clears throat]

20:05.204 --> 20:07.945
Although it pains me
more than I can say.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.426
What kind of message
does it send out
to the rest of Wessex

20:10.600 --> 20:14.038
that the King
is abandoning his Royal Villa?

20:14.213 --> 20:17.216
I suppose it sends a message
of comparative weakness.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.481
And, unfortunately,
we are weak.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.353
We are surrounded by enemies

20:24.527 --> 20:26.921
and now we face
another great Viking army.

20:35.669 --> 20:39.238
One should never
be afraid of the truth,
my sweet Elsewith.

20:39.412 --> 20:42.545
What difference would it make
if I lied about our strength?

20:42.719 --> 20:47.028
Far better to be honest.
To trust in the Lord,
and be practical.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.249
These lessons I have learned.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.164
I can't bear it!

20:53.339 --> 20:55.254
I can't bear the fact that
it's the same Vikings

20:55.428 --> 20:58.257
that killed your grandfather
and your father!

20:58.431 --> 21:02.435
And now here they are again.
They will never go away.
They must always win!

21:02.609 --> 21:05.264
Even when they are defeated,
they win!

21:08.919 --> 21:10.356
What do you mean?

21:10.530 --> 21:11.879
Well, whenever
they are defeated in battle,

21:12.053 --> 21:14.360
the Vikings always offer
to make a deal.

21:14.534 --> 21:18.015
They swear on their arm-rings,
or they even agree
to conversion as Christians,

21:18.189 --> 21:19.582
just so that
they can make the deal!

21:19.756 --> 21:23.064
An exchange of hostages.
Some land for peace.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.980
Whatever it is,
I've seen it again and again.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.808
And it's often your fault.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.288
You've been so keen on peace,

21:29.462 --> 21:32.421
you've rushed in
and agreed to their terms!

21:32.595 --> 21:34.684
But, for the most part,
they don't mean it.

21:34.858 --> 21:37.296
They don't really convert.

21:37.470 --> 21:41.691
They don't care if the hostages
they provide have to die
for a broken promise.

21:55.444 --> 21:56.793
[sighs]

21:56.967 --> 22:00.144
Basically, they don't care.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.408
And you, my love,
have always been
their victim...

22:04.235 --> 22:06.325
and I fear the same thing
will happen again.

22:14.028 --> 22:14.855
[sighs]

22:35.136 --> 22:36.224
[exhales]

23:07.647 --> 23:08.604
[grunts]

23:37.024 --> 23:37.807
[gasps]

23:49.471 --> 23:50.429
[gasping]

24:00.482 --> 24:04.094
[Ingrid] I drive it
into the eye of Vigfadir.

24:05.661 --> 24:08.447
I drive it
into the eye of Valfaoir.

24:12.712 --> 24:15.454
I drive it
into the eye of Asathor.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.504
Thor and Odin,
hear my prayer,

24:22.678 --> 24:25.420
and heed my commands

24:25.594 --> 24:28.205
and bless this stave.

24:28.379 --> 24:31.992
Thekkr. Fjolnir. Thundr. Freyr.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.429
Thrumr. Fengr.

24:34.603 --> 24:38.128
Yes! Do your work.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.508
[Ivar] Whoa.

25:18.821 --> 25:19.996
You take the right track.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.825
You, take the reins.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.088
[grunts]

25:25.262 --> 25:26.916
[horses snorting]

25:38.232 --> 25:39.668
[church bell tolling]

25:39.842 --> 25:42.671
[Alfred] In Thee, O Lord,
do I put my trust.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.760
Let me never be
put to confusion.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.068
O God, be not far from me.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.723
O my God,
make haste for my help,

25:50.897 --> 25:53.987
incline Thine ear unto me,
and save me.

25:55.945 --> 25:59.949
Hear my prayer, O Lord,
and let my cry come unto Thee.

26:46.779 --> 26:50.870
For my days
are like a shadow
that declineth.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.960
But Thou, O Lord,
shall endure forever.

26:54.134 --> 26:59.052
Thou shalt arise,
and have mercy upon Wessex.

26:59.226 --> 27:03.491
The time to favor her,
yea, the time set, is come.

27:20.813 --> 27:21.640
[indistinct chatter]

27:25.687 --> 27:27.776
[Alfred] So the heathen
shall fear the name
of the Lord,

27:27.950 --> 27:30.387
and all of the Kings
of the earth Thy glory.

27:30.997 --> 27:31.998
Charge!

27:33.564 --> 27:34.827
[soldiers shouting]

27:35.001 --> 27:38.352
Shield wall! Shield wall!

27:43.966 --> 27:44.706
Archers!

27:44.880 --> 27:47.753
[Wiglaf] Charge! Charge!

27:47.927 --> 27:50.669
[Ivar] Brace! Brace!

27:54.194 --> 27:55.021
Loose!

27:57.545 --> 27:58.285
Loose!

27:58.459 --> 28:00.156
Break them!

28:01.941 --> 28:04.030
Take him down!

28:04.204 --> 28:06.206
Archers, left! And right!

28:07.294 --> 28:09.470

28:31.361 --> 28:32.711

28:36.149 --> 28:38.238
Circle in! Circle!

28:38.412 --> 28:40.022
Flanks out! Out!

28:42.808 --> 28:44.723
Hold it! Hold it!

28:47.987 --> 28:49.510
Now! Close in!

28:51.338 --> 28:52.643
Close in!

28:55.908 --> 28:56.691
[grunting]

28:57.910 --> 28:58.693
[Ivar] Fight!

28:58.867 --> 29:00.564
Take him down!

29:00.739 --> 29:01.740
[Hvitserk] Ivar!

29:07.789 --> 29:09.312

29:57.970 --> 29:58.840
[captain] Retreat!

30:00.799 --> 30:01.800
Fall back!

30:03.105 --> 30:03.976
Fall back!

30:04.150 --> 30:05.804
[overlapping shouting]

30:10.765 --> 30:11.897
[all cheering]

30:13.028 --> 30:13.942
[grunts]

30:14.116 --> 30:15.378
[Viking 1] Yes!

30:17.163 --> 30:18.947
You're still alive, huh?

30:19.121 --> 30:21.167
As you can see.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.865
-What took you so long?
-[laughing]

30:26.433 --> 30:28.391

[horses neighing]

32:18.632 --> 32:19.894
[crackling]

33:34.229 --> 33:36.188
[Saxon 1] Godspeed, sir!

33:36.362 --> 33:38.494
May God be with you!
Wessex is with you!

34:01.430 --> 34:02.649
[horse whinnying]

34:12.354 --> 34:13.747
-[Saxon soldier 1] Good boy.
-[Saxon soldier 2]
Thank you, Brother.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.575
[Saxon soldier 3]
I'll let the horses rest.

34:15.749 --> 34:17.011
[Saxon soldier 4] Over here!
Take the horses to the front.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.143
[Saxon soldier 1]
No, leave it there!

34:18.317 --> 34:19.753
[indistinct chatter]

34:25.280 --> 34:26.716
I hope you are
proud of yourself.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.066
"Proud"?

34:29.154 --> 34:30.633
In what way?

34:30.807 --> 34:33.201
Leaving the ancestral home
of the Kings of Wessex,

34:34.376 --> 34:36.161
without even a fight.

34:36.335 --> 34:39.381
Elsewith,
they are just buildings.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.992
It is just a place.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.473
Surely you understand
that the spiritual home
of our people

34:44.647 --> 34:47.737
is vested
not in a place,
but in a person.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.090
It is only important
that Ivar does not
capture me...

34:53.569 --> 34:54.962
for I am Wessex.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.364
-[Saxon soldier 1] Quickly!
-[Saxon soldier 2]
All men on lookout!

35:09.019 --> 35:11.848
-How are you feeling?
-[Erik] Good.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.938
Mmm.

35:23.425 --> 35:24.557
[footsteps approaching]

35:25.427 --> 35:26.689
What is it?

35:26.863 --> 35:28.213
I commissioned
this cloak for you.

35:30.389 --> 35:31.129
Like it?

35:35.611 --> 35:36.351
Yes.

35:39.441 --> 35:40.225
[exhales]

35:41.443 --> 35:42.531
[groans]

35:44.838 --> 35:46.840
I just want to make you happy.

35:47.014 --> 35:48.668
And why would I not be happy?

35:50.060 --> 35:51.410
I rule Kattegat.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.848
And, more than that,
I have you.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.592
Life is perfect.

36:05.511 --> 36:06.468
[sighs]

36:11.691 --> 36:13.040
[sighs]

36:29.099 --> 36:31.841
[Ivar] What did I tell you?
Is this not perfect?

36:32.015 --> 36:34.931
King Alfred will be bound
to venture out to raise an army

36:35.105 --> 36:36.846
and to visit his strongholds
in the south.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.197
But wherever he goes...

36:40.937 --> 36:42.243
we'll see him.

36:44.941 --> 36:48.510
We should position scouts
on tops of all those
surrounding hills

36:48.684 --> 36:50.730
to warn of his approach.

36:51.818 --> 36:52.949
And apart from that,

36:53.994 --> 36:55.213
we just wait.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.233
[Erik shouting indistinctly]

37:18.236 --> 37:19.324
[groaning]

37:19.498 --> 37:21.804
What is it? Erik!

37:21.978 --> 37:23.241
It's my eye!

37:24.503 --> 37:25.982
Show me.

37:29.551 --> 37:30.248
I can't see!

37:31.205 --> 37:32.250
[continues groaning]

37:34.817 --> 37:37.777
-What's happened to you?
-I don't know! I don't know!

37:38.908 --> 37:40.170
[gasping]

37:42.085 --> 37:43.565
I'm half blind!

37:43.739 --> 37:45.263
[gasping]

37:47.482 --> 37:48.570
I'm half blind!

37:51.486 --> 37:54.184
I drive it
into the eye of Valfaoir.

37:54.794 --> 37:55.795
Yes!

37:55.969 --> 37:57.275
[groans]

37:57.449 --> 37:58.928
[pants]

38:20.602 --> 38:23.083
[indistinct shouting]

38:23.257 --> 38:25.172
-[Viking 1] Can you see them?
-[Viking 2]
Keep your eyes open!

38:29.611 --> 38:33.136
Just think, very soon,

38:33.311 --> 38:34.834
all of this will be all ours.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.966
Everything
as far as the eye can see.

38:38.490 --> 38:40.318
All ours, my dear brother.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.799
And Harald's, huh?

38:46.062 --> 38:48.064
Nah.

38:48.238 --> 38:51.285
It seems to me that
King Harald's days
are probably numbered.

38:51.459 --> 38:52.504
Wouldn't you agree?

38:55.028 --> 38:56.029
[scoffs]

39:01.077 --> 39:02.383
[Erik groaning]

39:02.557 --> 39:06.169
No! No!
[gasping]

39:08.737 --> 39:10.173
[gasping]

39:11.566 --> 39:14.047
[screaming]

39:14.221 --> 39:15.353
[servant woman]
What happened to him?

39:17.485 --> 39:18.617
[panting]

39:20.314 --> 39:21.576
[whispering]
No, no...

39:21.750 --> 39:24.362
[gasping and sobbing]

39:27.930 --> 39:29.323
[growls]

39:32.544 --> 39:34.110
[grunting]

39:45.557 --> 39:46.558
[grunting]

39:50.300 --> 39:51.476
[gasping]

39:53.608 --> 39:54.392
Erik.

39:57.612 --> 39:58.657
What is it?

40:00.528 --> 40:01.486
[Erik gasping]

40:03.488 --> 40:04.880
I'm blind.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.492
I'm blind.

40:08.841 --> 40:10.190
[panting]

40:19.504 --> 40:21.506
[oar continues tapping]

41:16.430 --> 41:17.475
Look!

41:24.960 --> 41:26.266
-Torvi!
-What?

41:26.440 --> 41:28.137
-Look!
-What?

41:29.748 --> 41:30.488
[Torvi grunts]

41:33.316 --> 41:34.492
I can't see.

41:39.148 --> 41:40.498
Can't you see? Look!

41:43.370 --> 41:44.502
Don't scare me, Ubbe.

41:45.807 --> 41:47.113
I can't see anything.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.508
You must be blind.

41:55.991 --> 41:57.471
[all sobbing]

42:24.977 --> 42:26.195
We made it.

42:27.936 --> 42:29.155
We made it.

42:44.605 --> 42:46.738
-[Othere weeping]
-You were right.

42:49.828 --> 42:51.569
Everything that you said
was true.

42:53.266 --> 42:55.137
And I should have believed you.

42:55.311 --> 42:57.052
Everybody should
have believed you.

42:57.966 --> 42:59.968
Forgive me.

43:00.142 --> 43:01.579
[voice breaks]
Please forgive me.

43:05.583 --> 43:10.805
You don't need forgiveness,
Ubbe, son of Ragnar.

43:13.025 --> 43:17.595
Because I know,
deep inside,
you always believed.

43:19.422 --> 43:21.816
And that is why we are here.

43:21.990 --> 43:24.950
That is why we are here!

43:27.779 --> 43:28.997
[laughs]

43:42.794 --> 43:44.752
[music playing]
