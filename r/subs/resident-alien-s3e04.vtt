00:01.436 --> 00:03.916
<i>Previously on "Resident Alien"...</i>

00:03.916 --> 00:05.440
<i>There are Grey-human
hybrids all over the Earth.</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:08.399
That's the man who shot
Peter Bach and my guards.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.445
We need to find out
what the Greys are up to.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.186
<i>The Greys' cavern is here.</i>

00:12.186 --> 00:14.753
<i>If they've connected it
to the magma chamber,</i>

00:14.753 --> 00:16.929
<i>the pressure would turn
Yellowstone National Park</i>

00:16.929 --> 00:19.541
<i>into the most destructive
natural bomb</i>

00:19.541 --> 00:21.543
<i>in the history of the world.</i>

00:21.543 --> 00:23.980
- So how long till it blows up?
- Maybe a year.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.677
You broke galactic law.

00:25.677 --> 00:28.071
You are hereby ordered
to leave Earth immediately.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.855
Son of a bitch.

00:29.855 --> 00:32.380
<i>That right there
is a fingerprint.</i>

00:32.380 --> 00:34.947
"Dr. Wendy Beasley,
retired military chemist."

00:34.947 --> 00:37.167
We did it!
We got a match!

00:39.169 --> 00:40.475
No, I chose last time.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.780
I want to go where
you want to go.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.391
- Uh-huh.
- Really.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.436
Okay.
Well, how about Antonio's?

00:45.436 --> 00:47.047
You think?
The pasta?

00:47.047 --> 00:50.528
Okay, well, if you were me,
what would you want to eat?

00:50.528 --> 00:53.575
Well, you always
like Mexican.

00:53.575 --> 00:54.967
I do, don't I?

00:54.967 --> 00:57.231
Mm-hmm.
Mount Taco it is.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.580
Mount Taco.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.974
- Have fun in the lab.
- Okay.

01:08.329 --> 01:12.115
<i>Dr. Wendy Beasley,
please come to Lab 209.</i>

01:12.115 --> 01:13.464
<i>Dr. Wendy Beasley,
please come--</i>

01:13.464 --> 01:15.771
- Aah!

01:18.904 --> 01:20.428
Gary?

01:23.039 --> 01:25.085
Open the door!

01:25.085 --> 01:28.088
Somebody open the door!
Please.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.699
- Help!
- Gary.

01:30.699 --> 01:33.005
Gary. Gary.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.833
Oh, my God.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.923
Oh, my God.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.012
Oh, my God, Gary!

01:40.012 --> 01:42.058
No, no, no!

01:42.058 --> 01:44.104
Gary!

01:55.158 --> 01:57.421
They can't just
make you leave Earth.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.206
We will fight this summons.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.208
You do not understand.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.123
The Galactic Federation
has referred this

02:03.123 --> 02:06.256
to the Housing Council.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.084
I-it is over.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.130
Harry, you can't
just give up.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.522
We need you here, okay?

02:11.522 --> 02:13.350
I don't give a shit
about this Housing Council.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.786
- No.
- Mm!

02:14.786 --> 02:17.833
You cannot talk that way
about Housing Council.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.400
It is very dangerous.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.665
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.
- I can translate.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.449
It's mostly
about losing a hand.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.625
- Oh.
- Good choice.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.758
What are you
doing with those?

02:29.758 --> 02:33.762
Putting them where all
eviction notices go--the fire.

02:33.762 --> 02:36.982
Oh, those--
those will not burn.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.463
They're not paper.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.509
What is it?
- Moldar skin.

02:41.509 --> 02:42.771
Gross.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.773
I'm vegan now.
- Moldar skin is not gross.

02:44.773 --> 02:47.558
Moldar-skin hats
are the best hats.

02:47.558 --> 02:50.213
Moldar skin--
try and rip it.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.389
You cannot.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.393
The processor is coming.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.700
Try not to be distracted
by her pretty face.

02:58.700 --> 03:03.661
Pubescent aliens hang holograms
of Blue Avians above their bed.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.185
I did.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.711
Oh.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.150
You are a bird.

03:14.150 --> 03:17.022
No, no!
Damn it!

03:17.022 --> 03:19.503
Stupid portal.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.331
Sucks--I-I'm supposed to appear

03:21.331 --> 03:23.377
as the life forms
of my destination.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.814
Now I'm breaking galactic law.
Great.

03:25.814 --> 03:28.251
You do not need to appear
as a human.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.514
You are perfect
the way you are.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.690
Thanks, but this thing
has been touchy

03:32.690 --> 03:35.127
ever since some idiot
from probate tried

03:35.127 --> 03:36.477
to sneak fruit through it.

03:36.477 --> 03:37.869
Why can't you take fruit?

03:37.869 --> 03:40.394
That's the question
you're asking right now?

03:40.394 --> 03:43.310
Look, just give me
the signed papers, okay?

03:43.310 --> 03:45.050
And then the Housing Council
is going to come,

03:45.050 --> 03:47.357
and they're going to collect
you for eviction.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.533
You smell woodsy.
I will sign them.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.622
- Please, Mrs. Bird--
- Oh, no.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.058
Don't come at me
with "Mrs. Bird."

03:53.058 --> 03:56.236
My Earth name is Heather.
- Oh, rhymes with feather.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.760
Yeah. It does.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.023
Wish someone had told me that
when I picked it.

04:01.023 --> 04:04.896
Heather, Harry is
here to save our planet.

04:04.896 --> 04:08.465
So, if you could just look
the other way on this one...

04:08.465 --> 04:11.251
You know I get paid
by the job, right?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.991
And how would I know that?

04:12.991 --> 04:15.516
Well, look,
if you want the papers,

04:15.516 --> 04:17.387
they're over there
on the floor.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.171
- Okay.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.869
Don't worry, I'll grab them.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.523
I'll just go get them
off the floor

04:22.523 --> 04:23.872
like a friggin' pigeon.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.920
- Oh, no, no, no!

04:28.920 --> 04:31.096
Oh, no!
both: Oh.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.968
Terrible news.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.971
Yeah, I can tell you two are
really, really upset about it,

04:35.971 --> 04:38.452
but this sucks for me, okay?

04:38.452 --> 04:40.715
Because now I have to call
the repair guy,

04:40.715 --> 04:42.412
and he's going to take forever.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.067
And then he's going
to have to order parts,

04:45.067 --> 04:46.547
which will take forever.

04:46.547 --> 04:50.115
And so, basically, I'm stuck
on the shittiest planet

04:50.115 --> 04:51.508
in the galaxy.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.641
No offense--
I see your mouths are agape

04:53.641 --> 04:55.686
at me saying
"shittiest planet."

04:55.686 --> 04:56.600
Sorry.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.820
I need to use the bathroom.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.083
Uh, do we put down
a newspaper or something?

05:01.083 --> 05:02.606
It's to change, you dick.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.740
It is down the hall
on your right.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.960
I hope I put the seat down.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.180
I just saved the world
with a banana.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.616
How was your day?
- Yeah, you did.

05:12.616 --> 05:15.445
It was the best one.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.404
It was the perfect
amount of ripe.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.970
So, question--

05:18.970 --> 05:22.974
um, can any of you recommend
a hotel around here?

05:22.974 --> 05:26.630
Something mid-range, preferably
where you can earn miles?

05:26.630 --> 05:29.503
Huh.
I see Heather now.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.468
Hey.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.862
You're up early.
- Yeah.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.472
Still can't sleep.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.387
Up half the night
feeling terrified,

05:44.387 --> 05:45.867
and I don't know why.
- Oh.

05:45.867 --> 05:49.914
But I was thinking,
sometimes you're stressed.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.002
All the time.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.526
- A lot of the time.
- Every day.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.397
But not when
you're making candles--

05:54.397 --> 05:56.312
because you have
a creative outlet.

05:56.312 --> 05:59.271
And I haven't picked up my
sketchbook in a while, I know,

05:59.271 --> 06:02.492
but I think I'm going to do
a children's book.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.059
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.669
You know, when I was a kid,

06:05.669 --> 06:09.325
I always wanted a book with
a baby elephant and a monkey.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.196
- Oh, that's sweet.
- Yeah.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.677
- This isn't that.
- Got it.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.897
Well, can I see?
- Eh...

06:15.897 --> 06:19.204
I-I think I'd rather just
wait till it's finished.

06:19.204 --> 06:21.859
Okay.
Say no more.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.426
Mm-hmm.

06:23.426 --> 06:26.168
But if there is
a baby elephant--

06:26.168 --> 06:30.477
- There's not.
- Two words--sailor's cap.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.217
Think about it.

06:32.217 --> 06:35.786
Now, why would a
well-respected military chemist

06:35.786 --> 06:37.135
end up living way out here

06:37.135 --> 06:39.442
like some kind
of creepy-ass fairy-tale witch?

06:39.442 --> 06:42.445
They say she kind of lost it
after she saw her husband die

06:42.445 --> 06:44.752
in a lab accident.
- A lab accident?

06:44.752 --> 06:46.667
You saying we could be facing
a super villain?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.756
Um, no, I was not.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.411
Okay, 'cause I can't be
facing a super villain,

06:51.411 --> 06:52.890
not while I'm trying
to figure out

06:52.890 --> 06:54.631
what happened
to my best deputy.

06:54.631 --> 06:55.937
Now, tell me again what you saw

06:55.937 --> 06:58.418
when you went
by Joseph's house, exactly.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.854
Okay, we're definitely
going to get

06:59.854 --> 07:02.204
back to the best-deputy part.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.336
I told you, it was empty.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.034
He's gone.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.427
Isn't that suspicious?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.733
He's army recon.
He wouldn't just quit.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.605
What's even
more suspicious is,

07:11.605 --> 07:13.476
right when we're looking
for another deputy,

07:13.476 --> 07:15.478
the perfect candidate
just shows up.

07:15.478 --> 07:16.827
That's how it works
for handsome people.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.438
Happens to me all the time.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.397
Every job I ever got didn't
even exist until I wanted it.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.226
The job of sheriff existed
before you had it, sir.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.750
Yeah, but it was the day
I said to myself,

07:26.750 --> 07:28.143
it'd be nice to be sheriff,

07:28.143 --> 07:30.450
that old Sheriff Hawthorne up
and died.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.190
Now, did I kill him?
Maybe.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.758
Luckily, you can't be arrested
for your thoughts...

07:34.758 --> 07:36.107
yet.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.892
But I'm working on it.

07:37.892 --> 07:41.461
What if we fake
Harry's death?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.637
Can't get evicted
if you're dead.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.509
I have no choice
but to leave Earth.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.729
We have been brainstorming
all morning.

07:48.729 --> 07:52.950
The storm has stopped,
and now there is just mud.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.386
Hey, guys.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.953
Asta, I'm going to see you
at Drew's party tomorrow?

07:55.953 --> 07:57.912
Yes.
Of course I'll be there.

07:57.912 --> 08:01.872
Is that a pie?
I need it for my trip.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.918
It is a pie,
but it's not for you.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.050
It's for my paralegal.
- Oh.

08:06.050 --> 08:09.053
Hey, hypothetically, say your
friend was getting evicted--

08:09.053 --> 08:11.447
Is this the same
friend as last time?

08:11.447 --> 08:13.144
By the way,
you still owe me $200.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.233
Uh, without names,

08:15.233 --> 08:18.889
say you wanted to stop
the hypothetical eviction.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.370
My first piece of legal
advice would be not to co-sign

08:21.370 --> 08:22.632
a lease with this one.
- Okay.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.286
I just--Can we--
- Noted.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.896
But for your other friend,

08:25.896 --> 08:29.683
I would say maybe just wait
it out or possibly countersue.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.119
What are you doing?

08:32.512 --> 08:34.644
It was like that.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.908
You're countersuing?

08:37.908 --> 08:40.911
Do you even realize
how much paperwork that is?

08:40.911 --> 08:44.698
Guess I can say goodbye to my
timeshare on Lesser Antares.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.830
Oh, I am sorry.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.833
Lesser Antares is very pretty.
- Yeah.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.053
I have Moldar-skin pants
from there.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.228
Me too.

08:54.664 --> 08:55.796
They're so durable.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.580
You ever try ripping
them in half?

08:57.580 --> 08:59.190
both: ♪ You cannot

09:02.542 --> 09:05.545
Hey, no one's ever taken on
the Housing Council before.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.850
What's going on with you?

09:06.850 --> 09:09.549
You some kind of bad boy
or something?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.594
Yep, I'm a bad boy.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.207
Oh.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.861
I don't care about it.

09:17.861 --> 09:20.298
I'm not even a real doctor.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.213
Ooh, that is bad.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.606
I killed a man.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.174
You what?

09:26.174 --> 09:28.045
He was evil.

09:28.045 --> 09:31.222
I saw him kick a seagull.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.616
- Oh.
- And stole its French fry.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.097
- Uh-uh.
- So I killed him.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.754
It's nice to talk
to a-another alien.

09:40.754 --> 09:44.235
If you are going to be

09:44.235 --> 09:45.889
in Patience for a while,

09:45.889 --> 09:48.413
maybe I could show
you around town.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.025
We have a pizza place!
- I don't like pizza.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.941
Oh, I hate pizza.
We are the same.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.682
Thanks, but I think
I'm just going to head

09:55.682 --> 09:56.944
back to the hotel.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.599
My back has been killing me
for some reason.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.166
It is the human bed--

10:02.166 --> 10:03.428
so primitive.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.343
I miss my Trixian saliva bed.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.910
Wait, you're kidding me?

10:06.910 --> 10:08.825
I didn't know you
could still get those.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.827
Bad boys can.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.658
I could look at you in the
exam room, help your back.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.834
We could talk
about spit blankets.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.097
Okay.

10:23.971 --> 10:27.931
Nurse, uh, make Heather
more comfortable.

10:27.931 --> 10:30.847
Get--get--get a blanket
and spit on it.

10:30.847 --> 10:33.676
I will get her a blanket,
but I am not doing that.

10:38.420 --> 10:42.772
I am sorry for the primitive
nature of Earth medicine.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.557
This is how they
listen to your heart.

10:45.557 --> 10:49.866
Why not get two soup cans
and connect them with string?

10:49.866 --> 10:51.781
Oh.

10:51.781 --> 10:55.393
Oh, uh...
I can hear that you are dying.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.713
Uh, please remove your jacket.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.812
Everything okay back there?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.988
<i>Is she electric?</i>

11:24.988 --> 11:27.469
<i>I am buzzing,
and my knees are melting.</i>

11:29.471 --> 11:30.820
I fell.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.996
I was--
Something bit me.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.607
Oh. Sorry.
It's probably a mite.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.132
Or as you might say it...

11:38.132 --> 11:41.831
.

11:44.442 --> 11:47.707
You speak...

11:49.099 --> 11:50.622
Yeah, of course I do.

11:50.622 --> 11:54.017
It's one of the most beautiful
languages in the universe.

11:54.017 --> 11:56.150
<i>She is perfect in every way.</i>

11:56.150 --> 11:58.543
<i>I have a strange desire
to smell her.</i>

11:58.543 --> 11:59.806
<i>That would be weird.</i>

11:59.806 --> 12:01.851
<i>I bet she smells
like a feather pillow</i>

12:01.851 --> 12:03.331
<i>locked in a hot car.</i>

12:07.117 --> 12:08.771
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

12:10.642 --> 12:12.775
Me?

12:12.775 --> 12:14.559
All right.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.258
This--this is for you.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.263
Thank you.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.481
Oh.

12:25.527 --> 12:28.269
- What the hell were you doing?
- I don't know.

12:28.269 --> 12:32.360
My knees are weak,
and my palms are sweating.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.754
I know what this is.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.365
I have seen this
in human movies.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.628
I am in love.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.673
What?
No, you just met her.

12:41.673 --> 12:44.024
I love--I love her.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.852
- Shh.
- I cannot help it.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.550
I feel l-love for her.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.031
It's--it's like how I feel love
for you, Asta,

12:51.031 --> 12:52.249
but it is different.

12:52.249 --> 12:55.035
It is not just in my head
or in my heart,

12:55.035 --> 12:56.688
but it is in my pants.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.081
Oh.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.083
Is that why they
call it "in love"

13:00.083 --> 13:02.129
because it is in your pants?

13:02.129 --> 13:04.827
Harry?
You coming back?

13:04.827 --> 13:06.568
My legs.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.178
Okay.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.981
- Dr. Beasley?
- Who are you?

13:27.981 --> 13:31.506
We want to talk to you about
the alien tracker, Peter Bach.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.421
Peter Bach is dead.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.251
We know that.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.340
We believe he was murdered.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.563
I miss her.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.957
Do--do you think she misses me?

13:47.957 --> 13:51.091
I-I-I realize that your
first crush is...

13:51.091 --> 13:52.875
- Uh, everything.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.530
But--but we are trying
to save the world,

13:55.530 --> 13:57.227
you and me, you know?

13:57.227 --> 14:00.448
A-and you can't be distracted
by a relationship right now.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.624
My heart...

14:04.060 --> 14:05.670
It sweats.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.324
Huh?

14:07.324 --> 14:10.806
What heat remains
in my chest.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.460
And poetry.

14:12.460 --> 14:16.116
You are a light
in the blackout.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.552
Oh, boy.

14:17.552 --> 14:20.250
I'd like to touch you
where the eggs pop out.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.035
Yeah.

14:22.035 --> 14:25.821
It's titled "Bird Boner."

14:29.259 --> 14:31.827
Why don't you take a seat?

14:31.827 --> 14:33.873
Standing there,
it's making me uncomfortable.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.229
We're here because
we found your fingerprints

14:42.229 --> 14:43.491
in Peter's van.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.667
You have the van?
Where is it?

14:45.667 --> 14:47.538
Why is the van important?

14:47.538 --> 14:49.932
It--it doesn't matter.
You won't believe me.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.629
And if you do,
they'll get to you,

14:51.629 --> 14:53.196
and they will tell you
that I'm crazy.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.763
But I know what I saw,

14:54.763 --> 14:55.938
and I know what happened
to my husband,

14:55.938 --> 14:57.809
and it wasn't
a goddamn gas leak,

14:57.809 --> 14:59.899
and it wasn't made by humans.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.512
I see you.

15:04.512 --> 15:07.036
You think that I don't know
that look?

15:07.036 --> 15:10.126
You need to leave.

15:10.126 --> 15:13.913
Um, I saw a UFO...

15:13.913 --> 15:15.958
when I was a kid.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.526
Everyone said I made it up
for attention.

15:18.526 --> 15:22.660
And Peter was the only one
who has ever believed me.

15:22.660 --> 15:26.490
I need to find out
what happened, please.

15:26.490 --> 15:29.145
Peter trusted me.
So can you.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.629
- Do you have the key?
- The van key?

15:34.629 --> 15:35.978
I got it right here.

15:38.763 --> 15:41.418
If Peter trusted you, he
would have given you the key.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.335
Get out.

16:01.873 --> 16:05.399
Let me guess--still filling
out your college application?

16:05.399 --> 16:08.271
- These essays are stupid.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.012
Look,
I don't even want to go,

16:10.012 --> 16:12.101
but my mom thinks college
will give me options, so...

16:12.101 --> 16:14.016
Ah, options are good.
I didn't have many.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.410
I ended up living
with my dad till my 30s.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.195
Yeah. And that's why
I'm still single.

16:21.632 --> 16:24.548
"How has your family
history shaped your life?"

16:24.548 --> 16:26.333
That's fun.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.204
I'm adopted.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.902
Hmm.
Right.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.035
Yeah.
And so are you.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.428
So I don't know my family

16:34.428 --> 16:36.212
because you
don't know your family.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.475
So, apparently, only people
with enormous family trees

16:38.475 --> 16:39.563
get to go to college.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.044
The system is corrupt.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.437
I can't be a part of it.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.917
You're a part of our family.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.572
Yeah, but I'm not, like,
a blood relative.

16:48.572 --> 16:52.098
So it's--it's not really
the same thing.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.232
Have you taken her
to the rez yet?

16:56.232 --> 16:57.973
Not yet.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.409
It's settled.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.542
You're coming to Drew's party.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.587
Time to meet your whole family.

17:03.587 --> 17:04.936
You wanted a family tree,

17:04.936 --> 17:07.765
you got yourself
a whole forest.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.811
<i>This model
of the Yellowstone caldera</i>

17:09.811 --> 17:12.205
<i>will help me figure out
the Greys' plan.</i>

17:12.205 --> 17:14.859
<i>I have to present my findings
to the general tomorrow,</i>

17:14.859 --> 17:16.339
<i>and I still do not know</i>

17:16.339 --> 17:19.081
<i>why the Greys want to blow up
the super volcano.</i>

17:19.081 --> 17:22.171
<i>If I can find the answer,
I bet it will impress Heather.</i>

17:22.171 --> 17:25.305
<i>I wonder if her feathers
are soft.</i>

17:25.305 --> 17:29.135
Oh, shit, I did it again!

17:29.135 --> 17:31.398
<i>This is what Asta
was talking about.</i>

17:31.398 --> 17:34.096
<i>Even thinking about her
is interrupting my work.</i>

17:34.096 --> 17:37.578
<i>Maybe if I call Heather and
hear her voice, it will help,</i>

17:37.578 --> 17:40.233
<i>like when I am hungry
and eat just one potato chip.</i>

17:40.233 --> 17:42.278
Yeah.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.630
<i>Hello, Harry.</i>

17:50.330 --> 17:52.854
Aah!

17:55.726 --> 17:57.728
Nope, nope, nope.

18:01.906 --> 18:05.127
Uh, Dr. Harry Vanderspeigle
speaking.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.390
It's Heather.
You just called me.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.305
Nope.
Nope, I'm--

18:09.305 --> 18:10.828
You called me.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.701
Because you called me.

18:13.701 --> 18:16.312
It's fine.
I was going to call you anyway.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.792
You were?

18:17.792 --> 18:19.968
I mean--

18:19.968 --> 18:21.230
What about?

18:21.230 --> 18:23.450
I found this hole
with a little bump in it

18:23.450 --> 18:25.016
on my stomach,

18:25.016 --> 18:27.236
and I've never been nude
in human form

18:27.236 --> 18:28.368
long enough to notice it.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.370
What is it for?

18:30.370 --> 18:34.330
The reason is gross.
I threw up when I found out.

18:34.330 --> 18:37.986
Humans grow babies
inside of their bodies.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.074
<i>Oh.</i>

18:39.074 --> 18:40.902
And then they come
out of that bump?

18:40.902 --> 18:44.862
No. Although, the reality
is not much better.

18:44.862 --> 18:47.126
Okay.
I'm going to hang up.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.867
I want to go back to exploring
every single inch of my body.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.609
<i>I will never be able
to work again.</i>

18:52.609 --> 18:54.089
My knees.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.934
Elliot, hi.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.631
Hi.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.067
Laundry day.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.200
Fun times, yeah.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.942
Uh, how are you doing?
- I'm good.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.552
It's good to see you.

19:22.552 --> 19:23.597
Hi.

19:25.294 --> 19:26.861
This is Natalie.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.168
Natalie, this is D'Arcy.
- Hey.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.561
Oh, you're D'Arcy.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.302
Hi.

19:33.302 --> 19:36.958
Oh, you're Natalie.
Of course.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.577
- How have you been?
- Oh, I've been great.

19:47.577 --> 19:48.752
So good.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.798
Yeah, I've been doing stuff,
big stuff.

19:50.798 --> 19:53.104
This morning I had
a crazy thing happen--

19:53.104 --> 19:54.323
before laundry--

19:54.323 --> 19:57.326
where I did this huge thing.

19:57.326 --> 20:01.025
I can't tell you what it is,
but pretty major.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.593
Um, kind of top secret, but...

20:03.593 --> 20:06.944
I'd say, without me,
the world would be over.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.772
Lots of people saved.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.471
Banana was involved.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.255
Okay, well, it was nice
meeting you,

20:13.255 --> 20:15.779
but we should probably go.
- Yeah, I got to go too.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.872
Got to fold this stuff, so...

20:32.056 --> 20:34.276
Therefore,
the Greys will harness

20:34.276 --> 20:37.714
the intense natural power
of the caldera--

20:37.714 --> 20:41.805
not unlike the intense
natural power of love.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.068
Oh, so intense and strong,

20:44.068 --> 20:47.550
and you can't let it
get away...

20:47.550 --> 20:50.727
just like you cannot let the--
the Greys get away

20:50.727 --> 20:53.904
with setting off
a super--super volcano

20:53.904 --> 20:56.080
and destroying,

20:56.080 --> 21:00.171
uh, all humanity on Earth.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.825
Boom.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.612
How does an alien species
dig an underground cavern

21:05.612 --> 21:07.527
in the middle
of a national park for 80 years

21:07.527 --> 21:09.268
and we don't know about it?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.661
I can take that one.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.141
Humans are stupid.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.273
How do we know this alien

21:14.273 --> 21:15.752
isn't working
with the other aliens?

21:15.752 --> 21:17.363
How do I know
this general isn't working

21:17.363 --> 21:18.668
with the other generals?

21:18.668 --> 21:20.409
I am working
with the other generals.

21:20.409 --> 21:23.325
- He admits it!
- Stop.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.240
He's one of the most
intelligent beings

21:25.240 --> 21:26.415
on this planet.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.765
We need his help
to find a solution

21:28.765 --> 21:32.639
to what might be the biggest
problem humans will ever face.

21:32.639 --> 21:36.730
That problem is, how do you
get them to love you back?

21:36.730 --> 21:38.775
Let's toss that around.
There's no wrong answers.

21:38.775 --> 21:43.258
I was talking about the swarm
of Grey hybrids at Yellowstone.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.129
Oh, okay.

21:45.129 --> 21:47.175
We'll do the love thing next.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.437
I recommend full assault--

21:48.437 --> 21:51.135
shockwave tasers,
mass electrocution.

21:51.135 --> 21:53.877
Oh, that's a terrible idea.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.488
If you attack the hybrids,

21:55.488 --> 21:57.403
then the Greys will just freeze
your soldiers

21:57.403 --> 21:59.056
and kill them all.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.972
- You can't sit and do nothing.
- Because love will go away.

22:01.972 --> 22:05.149
Thank you. That is one vote
for saying "I love you."

22:05.149 --> 22:07.238
He was talking
about the Greys.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.850
Oh, I need time
to figure out the plan.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.982
You have one week.

22:11.982 --> 22:13.549
Then we're moving in.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.557
all: Hey!

22:21.557 --> 22:24.038
- Mark, Dan.
- Hey.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.169
- Asta.
- Hi.

22:25.169 --> 22:27.084
And Jay, right?
- Yeah.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.304
Jay, these are
all your relations.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.567
This is your second cousin,
Sampson and Will.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.656
- Hi.
- Your cousin Peter.

22:33.656 --> 22:36.093
Kayla's sister Rachel.
- Hi.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.617
- Auntie Mena.
- Hi.

22:37.617 --> 22:40.881
Auntie Louise
and Grandma Ruth.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.362
And the happy couple,
Drew and Manuel.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.667
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.757
Thanks. It's really nice
to meet all of you.

22:47.757 --> 22:50.412
I think I might need to go
over the names once or twice.

22:50.412 --> 22:54.068
My girl, let's go get you
some buffalo stew.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.418
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.816
Oh, so handsome.

23:02.816 --> 23:05.862
- Thank you.
- Look at this--nice bling.

23:05.862 --> 23:08.604
Don't be jealous just because
you don't got a medallion yet.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.824
Wait, what about, um,
your short king, Harry?

23:10.824 --> 23:12.478
Where's your boyfriend Harry?

23:12.478 --> 23:13.740
Stop.
No. Stop it.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.742
- Where's boyfriend Harry?
- Oh, hey. Hey.

23:18.092 --> 23:19.702
I heard it was a tractor.

23:19.702 --> 23:21.791
Nuh-uh.
I heard it was a helicopter.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.663
Dewey said
it was a monster truck.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.055
What are we talking about?

23:25.055 --> 23:27.449
Trying to guess what
Liv and that sheriff

23:27.449 --> 23:29.625
have hidden on the rez.
- What?

23:29.625 --> 23:31.932
They're all wrong.
It's a van.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.413
They're trying to get
fingerprints.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.851
Interesting, a van.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.330
Where exactly?

23:41.071 --> 23:43.422
<i>You saw Dr. Beasley
when you mentioned the van?</i>

23:43.422 --> 23:44.771
We might not have the key,

23:44.771 --> 23:47.774
but there has to be
something we missed--

23:47.774 --> 23:49.428
like a keyhole?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.994
I may not trust
the forest doctor,

23:50.994 --> 23:53.083
but I do trust
your instincts, Deputy,

23:53.083 --> 23:56.391
and something's definitely
off with this van.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.566
What do you see?

23:57.566 --> 23:59.568
Well, this is
a 255-horsepower,

23:59.568 --> 24:02.745
5.4-liter
V-8 E350 cargo van, right?

24:02.745 --> 24:05.269
My buddy Roger,
he's got this exact model.

24:05.269 --> 24:09.752
Everything in here is standard
except for this flooring.

24:09.752 --> 24:12.059
See, this is
aftermarket black PVC

24:12.059 --> 24:13.582
thermoplastic lining, right?

24:13.582 --> 24:16.019
Now, I think we need
to get this lining out.

24:16.019 --> 24:17.760
We gonna find
what we're looking for.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.458
So I'm going to
need a few things.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.589
I'm going to need a crowbar.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.504
We need a half gallon
of muriatic acid.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.637
I'm going to need, like,
nine strips of firecrackers,

24:24.637 --> 24:26.856
the little ones, though,
not the M80s.

24:26.856 --> 24:30.077
Although I will need
16 of those.

24:30.077 --> 24:33.515
Found it.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.736
Well, well, well,
we got ourselves a keyhole.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.128
Huh.

24:38.128 --> 24:41.001
Once again, I have followed
your instincts

24:41.001 --> 24:42.959
and led us to victory.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.874
- Okay.
- Mm.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.012
<i>If I have learned one thing</i>

24:52.012 --> 24:54.014
<i>from meeting
with the generals,</i>

24:54.014 --> 24:55.711
<i>it is that mating is like war.</i>

24:55.711 --> 24:57.408
<i>You cannot sit around
and wait.</i>

24:57.408 --> 24:58.758
<i>You have to take action.</i>

24:58.758 --> 25:00.499
Do it.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.457
She's the one in the jacket.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.983
I think I know
which one she is.

25:09.986 --> 25:12.336
Oh, God, wait,
I changed my mind.

25:16.166 --> 25:19.169
What did she say?
She's looking over here.

25:22.782 --> 25:24.827
"Are there
any doctors in town

25:24.827 --> 25:26.089
"you like more than a friend?

25:26.089 --> 25:28.135
Circle yes, no, maybe."

25:28.135 --> 25:30.311
Did she say anything?
You got to tell me everything.

25:30.311 --> 25:33.270
Oh, she's com--she's coming.
Go, go, go.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.318
Harry, hey.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.409
Um, I'm really flattered.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.845
<i>It worked.</i>

25:42.845 --> 25:46.066
But, uh, you can't have
feelings for me.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.242
Your species has no emotions.

25:48.242 --> 25:51.027
I do.
I-it's the human in me.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.899
You ate a human?

25:52.899 --> 25:55.728
No.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.860
I mean, the DNA.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.514
Got it.

25:59.514 --> 26:02.038
Because I was going to ask you
how they, you know...

26:02.038 --> 26:03.823
- Taste?
- Mm-hmm.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.913
I don't know.

26:06.913 --> 26:11.918
Probably like chick--
like, uh...

26:11.918 --> 26:13.920
You were going
to say "chicken" just now.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.182
- I wasn't, no.
- Uh, you were.

26:15.182 --> 26:18.881
I was going to say
"ChapStick."

26:18.881 --> 26:22.624
It's a tasty...

26:22.624 --> 26:25.192
stick of wax.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.411
Oh, I know.
I've eaten quite a few of them.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.632
Yeah.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.982
You're great.
- Thank you.

26:34.505 --> 26:38.945
Your kind is usually so cold,
and you are so different.

26:38.945 --> 26:42.644
You're a lot--a lot different.

26:44.690 --> 26:49.172
It's just--I'm only hanging out
here until the portal is fixed.

26:49.172 --> 26:52.741
So what would be the point,
as they say?

26:54.003 --> 26:56.963
So let's just be friends.

27:00.444 --> 27:03.665
I understand.

27:03.665 --> 27:07.669
Yes, let's just be friends.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.976
Okay.

27:09.976 --> 27:14.110
So you're circling no?

27:14.110 --> 27:15.982
I would love to circle "yes,"

27:15.982 --> 27:18.158
but it's not--
that's not feasible.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.073
Right.

27:20.073 --> 27:23.076
Friends.

27:26.427 --> 27:29.648
Yeah.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.912
That's really all I want...

27:32.912 --> 27:35.654
is friendship.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.699
Great.

27:37.699 --> 27:40.441
<i>I want to die.</i>

27:48.144 --> 27:50.320
Thanks for showing
us so much love.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.759
All right, this next tune is
going out to our happy couple,

27:53.759 --> 27:55.195
Drew and Manuel.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.721

28:22.918 --> 28:24.833
Mike and Liv have been stashing
the alien tracker van

28:24.833 --> 28:26.400
on the rez.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.881
Who knows if there's any
traces of your DNA in there?

28:28.881 --> 28:31.579
You need to call me back.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.755
Bye.

28:33.755 --> 28:37.411
Don't tell Drew, but I think
Grams has a new favorite.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.500
I always knew
they'd get along.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.547
What?
What's wrong?

28:43.547 --> 28:47.856
Nothing. I'm--I'm so happy
she's here.

28:47.856 --> 28:51.251
I just--I wish when I was 16,

28:51.251 --> 28:53.340
I could have looked ahead
and seen all this,

28:53.340 --> 28:55.646
and then I would have known
that if I had held on to her,

28:55.646 --> 28:57.692
everything
would have been all right.

28:57.692 --> 29:00.564
That 16-year-old gave up
the most precious thing

29:00.564 --> 29:02.131
in her life.

29:02.131 --> 29:04.177
I can't imagine
how that must have hurt.

29:04.177 --> 29:06.962
But you did it because you knew
with everything going on

29:06.962 --> 29:10.226
in your life at that time that
it was the best thing for Jay.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.489
Right.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.276
Come on.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.582
- You want to dance?
- Oh, I do.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.457
I told you
not to look at that.

30:50.457 --> 30:52.415
Whoops, that's
not my checkbook.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.330
How much did you see?

30:54.330 --> 30:56.376
Only the scary parts.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.900
There are no scary parts.
It's a children's book.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.075
Hey, what's this?

31:00.075 --> 31:01.772
Oh, no, Max, don't.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.644
Hmm.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.125
No.

31:12.174 --> 31:14.220
We have a problem.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.222
Anders just walked off
the Darling Project.

31:16.222 --> 31:19.355
He said the results you want
are impossible.

31:19.355 --> 31:20.748
Get someone else.

31:20.748 --> 31:23.925
There is no one else
who's done this before.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.973
Yes, there is.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.931
Cobra up.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.237
Nice and easy.

31:31.237 --> 31:33.369
Head up to the sky.

31:33.369 --> 31:36.459
Breathe, take your time.

31:36.459 --> 31:40.463
When you're ready to go down,
push your hips up to the sky,

31:40.463 --> 31:43.162
strain your back,
and hold the pose.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.294
Hi.

31:47.601 --> 31:48.863
I'm retired.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.691
You retired me.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.214
What if I say no?

31:52.214 --> 31:54.956
I don't know.
Let's find out.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.349
That would be fun.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.755
If we run out of magnets,

32:11.755 --> 32:13.801
I got some more office supplies
from Amazon Prime.

32:13.801 --> 32:16.543
The Transformer?

32:16.543 --> 32:17.848
What?

32:17.848 --> 32:19.938
You know,
Optimus Prime's wife.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.985
Uh, no,
that's, um, not what I meant.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.987
Also, just curious,
how would I, like,

32:25.987 --> 32:28.947
even meet a Transformer to get
a box of magnets from them?

32:28.947 --> 32:32.863
Could be anyplace--the gym,
maybe an auto-body shop.

32:32.863 --> 32:36.215
Hey, look, check out
these schematics.

32:36.215 --> 32:40.523
It appears that your instincts
were dead-on.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.569
Look at that.

32:42.569 --> 32:45.354
Wow. There's room
for a hidden compartment

32:45.354 --> 32:46.921
near the cross-shaped indent.

32:46.921 --> 32:50.577
Now we just have to figure out
how to open it.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.405
Damn, that's
a high-quality magnet.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.407
Probably fit, like,
three of these pictures

32:54.407 --> 32:56.583
to Fred's metal hip
with one of these bad boys.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.150
Oh.

33:00.761 --> 33:04.286
Where did you find this magnet?
- I found it stuck to the desk.

33:04.286 --> 33:05.374
What desk?

33:09.378 --> 33:11.424
Wait, what's that?

33:13.643 --> 33:15.819
Bingo.

33:20.302 --> 33:22.391
What's he doing?

33:25.264 --> 33:27.962
He just put that phone
in his pocket.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.572
He's reading Robert's diary.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.270
Is there anything important
in that?

33:31.270 --> 33:32.967
The therapist's name.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.579
Sheriff, the therapist died

33:36.579 --> 33:38.973
a day after Joseph saw
that diary.

33:38.973 --> 33:41.410
So, if he came here
to spy on us,

33:41.410 --> 33:43.630
he could still be doing it.

33:44.892 --> 33:47.025
Dr. Beasley.

34:08.611 --> 34:10.178
We're too late.

34:18.578 --> 34:19.970
Oh.

34:19.970 --> 34:22.147
Yeah, this thing's
on its last legs.

34:24.279 --> 34:26.064
Well, I don't care
how many legs it has.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.980
Just how long to fix it,
and can you make it longer?

34:32.113 --> 34:34.115
Brought you pretzels.

34:34.115 --> 34:35.812
Well, I found them in the Jeep,

34:35.812 --> 34:38.250
but I brought them
inside, so...

34:38.250 --> 34:40.861
Is that a human?

34:40.861 --> 34:44.299
That is not cool, man.
She can't see me.

34:44.299 --> 34:46.780
This is going to go
on my record.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.825
That is just her human form.

34:48.825 --> 34:52.220
She is a slug species
from the Earendel system.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.354
Thanks for that.

34:55.354 --> 34:58.879
Now, you see your first alien,
mind-blowing.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.924
And then after that,
it's kind of like, meh.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.100
Why are you here?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.797
I need to check
on where we're at

35:03.797 --> 35:05.494
with the whole
"saving the world" thing.

35:05.494 --> 35:09.019
We are not at anywhere.

35:09.019 --> 35:12.371
I am building a model
of the Yellowstone caldera

35:12.371 --> 35:14.851
to figure out
what the Greys' plan is

35:14.851 --> 35:18.072
to slaughter
all of the human race.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.857
But I ran out of glitter.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.685
Oh, you made the snow
all sparkly.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.513
- Need some trees.

35:24.513 --> 35:26.167
Can I add some?

35:26.167 --> 35:27.908
You are already doing it.

35:27.908 --> 35:29.475
Question for you--

35:29.475 --> 35:31.433
you're an alien here to save
the world, blah, blah, blah.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.348
Does it ever bother you

35:33.348 --> 35:36.264
that you can't tell anybody
about it?

35:36.264 --> 35:40.312
It was hard at first,
but then...

35:40.312 --> 35:41.965
Asta found out.

35:41.965 --> 35:44.881
And it was easier

35:44.881 --> 35:48.755
because I was no longer alone.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.670
See, that's what I mean.

35:50.670 --> 35:53.281
I saw Elliot today.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.935
He has a girlfriend now,

35:54.935 --> 35:57.894
which kind of made me
feel like shit.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.418
Why are you telling me this?

35:59.418 --> 36:01.376
I don't know,
because you're an alien.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.857
I figure you can't judge me.
It's like talking to a dog.

36:03.857 --> 36:07.121
Anyway, if I could tell Elliot
what I was doing,

36:07.121 --> 36:10.690
you know, then I'd have
something too.

36:10.690 --> 36:14.563
If you do something special
and nobody knows about it,

36:14.563 --> 36:16.304
are you still special?

36:20.482 --> 36:22.702
So who's Elliot?

36:22.702 --> 36:25.835
You guys done or what?

36:25.835 --> 36:27.315
Go away.

36:29.361 --> 36:30.971
Also...

36:30.971 --> 36:33.234
Elliott is happy.

36:33.234 --> 36:37.325
And I was actually happy
to see him happy.

36:37.325 --> 36:40.589
If you were happy
that he was happy,

36:40.589 --> 36:43.244
then why is your face all mopey

36:43.244 --> 36:46.334
and your voice
is like wet underwear?

36:46.334 --> 36:50.773
Because if I want him happy,
even if he didn't want me,

36:50.773 --> 36:52.862
then that means that...

36:54.908 --> 36:57.432
I love him, and...

36:57.432 --> 37:00.218
I ruined something...

37:00.218 --> 37:01.436
real.

37:12.969 --> 37:16.364
Are we really not going to
talk about Mom's murder story?

37:16.364 --> 37:19.149
It's not--

37:19.149 --> 37:20.890
God forbid I write a sweet
little children's book.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.153
There are worms coming out
of the dead mouse's stomach.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.633
- Those are entrails.
- Ugh.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.287
I am done with dinner.

37:26.287 --> 37:30.030
Hon, Max is right.
Maybe we need to talk about it.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.339
Go ahead, Max.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.471
What?
No way am I going first.

37:36.471 --> 37:37.951
Okay.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.518
Well, I think we were
both just expecting

37:39.518 --> 37:41.650
something a little more cute
and--and upbeat

37:41.650 --> 37:43.173
for a children's book.

37:43.173 --> 37:46.133
It's a beautiful story
about a mother feeding

37:46.133 --> 37:47.613
and protecting her babies.

37:47.613 --> 37:51.051
Objectively, if you were
in your classroom

37:51.051 --> 37:55.447
and you saw
a student drawing this...

37:57.579 --> 38:01.496
Would you maybe call
their parents in to talk?

38:01.496 --> 38:03.629
Oh, my God,
what is happening to me?

38:05.370 --> 38:07.459
I can't get these owls
out of my head.

38:07.459 --> 38:10.505
I saw a movie once
where a person saw an owl,

38:10.505 --> 38:13.203
and it meant they were being
abducted by aliens.

38:13.203 --> 38:14.335
Does your butt hurt?

38:14.335 --> 38:16.032
Okay, that's not
really dinner talk.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.207
And we have been over this--

38:17.207 --> 38:20.080
there's no such thing
as aliens, okay?

38:31.004 --> 38:32.701
Getting the band
back together--

38:32.701 --> 38:35.051
man, we haven't dusted up
like that since...

38:35.051 --> 38:37.053
the Gathering of Nations.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.579
Yeah.

38:40.579 --> 38:44.104
Hey, Dad,
I think I did a bad thing.

38:44.104 --> 38:48.804
Harry's in love
with this alien bird.

38:48.804 --> 38:52.721
And so I told him
not to pursue it.

38:52.721 --> 38:55.898
I told him that he should focus
on saving the world,

38:55.898 --> 38:59.728
but I don't think
that's why I did it.

39:00.947 --> 39:04.211
Someone feeling
a little jealous?

39:04.211 --> 39:06.866
No.

39:06.866 --> 39:10.435
Well, not romantically anyway.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.828
But...

39:12.828 --> 39:14.700
maybe, yeah.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.224
I mean, it was always
just me and Harry.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.747
He needed me.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.967
And now he's not even answering
my phone calls.

39:20.967 --> 39:23.448
You know how much
you mean to him.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.971
I know.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.888
Being there today, seeing
all those people,

39:28.888 --> 39:32.282
surrounded by all that love...

39:32.282 --> 39:35.242
It just made me realize he
should get to have that too.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.681
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:39.681 --> 39:42.423
Thank you so much
for bringing me to the rez.

39:42.423 --> 39:45.905
It was a lot, but I loved it.

39:45.905 --> 39:49.909
Also, my mom and I kind of got
into a bit of a fight,

39:49.909 --> 39:53.086
so I was wondering
if maybe I could crash

39:53.086 --> 39:54.522
with you for a few days.

39:54.522 --> 39:57.743
Before you say no,
just think about it, okay?

39:57.743 --> 39:59.832
It could be fun.

39:59.832 --> 40:02.748
All right, um, I've got to go,
but think about it.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.924
All right.
I'll talk to you soon.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.404
O-okay.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.971
<i>There are many terrifying
things in the world,</i>

40:08.971 --> 40:11.931
<i>but the most terrifying
thing is love.</i>

40:16.109 --> 40:20.243

41:45.154 --> 41:47.548
Heather?

42:11.398 --> 42:13.356
Son of a bitch.

42:48.783 --> 42:50.611
Tell me
about when you worked

42:50.611 --> 42:52.570
for DARPA's
autonomous robotics program.

42:54.223 --> 42:57.096
The VA would donate soldiers
who were in a vegetative state

42:57.096 --> 42:58.488
to DARPA.

42:58.488 --> 42:59.925
Instead of pulling the plug,

42:59.925 --> 43:02.101
we kept them alive
and ran experiments.

43:02.101 --> 43:04.407
I quit that job.

43:04.407 --> 43:06.235
I still have nightmares.

43:10.544 --> 43:12.154
Nope.

43:12.154 --> 43:14.374
No way in hell
am I putting that thing on.

43:14.374 --> 43:16.245
It's not for you.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.250
It's for him.

43:23.470 --> 43:25.733
Who better to fight aliens

43:25.733 --> 43:28.475
than someone
who can see aliens?
